THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE CENTER MCGUIRE AND I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT WORK IS WORKING ON THE OTHER HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY- AND I WANT TO PARTICULARLY- THANK AYE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHO'S BEEN A REAL LEADER ON SORT OF ELEVATING AND FLAGGING THIS ISSUE FOR THREE FOUR YEARS NOW- AND- I KNOW IT'S A IT'S A THANK. ASKED BY ONE OF TO SEE PERSONALLY YOU FOR. OUR LEADERSHIP- WE DO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA BUT- BUT TO BE CLEAR FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE- IN CALIFORNIA- OF EVERY CONCEIVABLE TYPE OF HOUSING RANGING FROM SUPPORT. HOUSING FOR FROM ALMOST PEOPLE TO- MODERATE INCOME HOUSING TO MARKET RATE HOUSING SHORTAGE OF AT EVERY SINGLE. LEVEL ON THE TOTALS IN THE MILLIONS IN TERMS OF HOW MANY HOMES WERE SHORT- AND CALIFORNIA RANKS THE NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES IN HOMES PER CAPITA. IN THE LAST SIXTY YEARS WALKER BEFORE HIS POPULATION HAS ALMOST TRIPLED OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS KALAU BY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO THIRDS THREE QUARTERS SO ANYWAY YOU LOOK AT IT. WE WERE DRAMATIC- HOUSING SHORTAGE. KIND OF HOUSING. AT AND- TAXIS PART OF THAT OTHER ISSUES OF COURSE RESTRICTIVE TING. THE SLOW PACE OF APPROVING HOUSING IN THE NEED NEED FOR STREAMLINING THE NEED FOR MORE FUNDING THE NEED TO KEEP OUR RENTER'S STABLE IN THEIR HOUSING AND SO FORTH. IMPACT FEES IS DOUBLY PART OF THAT BUT AS WE DISCUSSES ISSUE ONE THING THAT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR AND I KNOW THAT OTHERS- I THINK OR I'M SURE IN AGREEMENT. SOMETIMES THIS ISSUE GETS PICKED SAYS- DEMONIZING CITIES% AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT YOU DID AXE- YOU MADE IT HARDER APPROVED. BUT THE RESTRICT DONATE. YOUR I IMPACT FEES. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO- FOR I LIKE TO FRAME THIS AS- YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING IS DON'T DON'T HATE THE PLAYERS HIT THE GAME- WE HAVE DESIGNED A SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AROUND HOUSING THAT IS THE WE CREATED A SYSTEM AROUND HOUSING CALIFORNIA. THAT IS DESIGNED TO FAIL- WE EXPECT I CITIES ODD TO- ROOF AND BUILD A HOUSING- BUT WE MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY HARD- TO DO SO WE CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE- CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO WALK THE PLANK EVERY WEEK A- GROUP HOUSING- AND WE DON'T HAVE THEIR BOXES AS- A LOT OF. A LOT OF THE ROOF WORK WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE. ST FIGHTING. WARM OR IMPACT THE FRANKLY NEEDS TO BE ABOUT CREATING A STRUCTURE WERE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF ACTUALLY- SUCCEEDING WHEN IT COMES TO IMPACT FEES WHILE THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT ENGAGE IN ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AND JOCK UP AND FEES IN ORDER TO TANK- DEVELOPMENT BY FINANCIALLY AND FEASIBLE THOSE CITIES DO EXIST THEY ARE A MINORITY- MOST CITIES ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO- FIND BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE NEEDS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MADE IT SO HARD FOR CITIES TO FIND THESE BASIC SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH- ARE RATHER TO PROP THIRTEEN OR THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU NEED TWO THIRDS OF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANY KIND OF FUN THAT MEASURE THROUGHOUT THE BUT IT HARD AND HARDER AD HARDER TO THESE TO BASIC NEEDS I AM SO. IS OUR PORCH OUR- WHERE TO GENERATE THAT REVENUE AND SO I DON'T BEGRUDGE CITIES YOU KNOW WANTING TO GENERATE THAT REVENUE THE PROBLEM IS THAT BECOMES THE EASIEST PATH TO DO IT AND SO WE SEE AN INCREASE INCREASE INCREASE AND IMPACT FEES AND THAT ENDS UP HARMING OUR ABILITY TO BUILD MORE HOUSINGBECAUSE IT MAKES HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD NOT BLAME CRITICIZING CITIES IT'S ABOUT SAYING HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THESE COMBINED. ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO FIND AROUND HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND PARKS AND SO FORTH IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE HOMELESSNESS CONTINUE TO RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING SO THAT TO ME IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. THE TOO MUCH TO CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE CHAIR WILL. LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOME WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT TO JOIN US TODAY THIS IS AS WE ALL KNOW SUCH AN IMPORTANT- ISSUE THAT WE- NEED TO DEAL WITH. AS WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN MANY STEPS. ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IN RECENT YEARS. INCLUDING REMOVING BARRIERS FOR ADA. GIVING THEY DO USE HIS ME CONSTRUCTION GIVING DIRECTION TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO MEET HOUSING PLANNING GOALS IN CREATING MORE CERTAINTY IN THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. ONE ISSUE WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THOUGH IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ARE TOO HIGH AND CAN BE A BARRIER TO NEW DEVELOPMENT. ON THE FLIP SIDE WE HEAR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RELY ON IMPACT FEES TO FUND NEARBY PARKS TRANSPORTATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RAISING REVENUE IN OTHER WAYS THE PROVES TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. IMPACT FEES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE FUNDING NEEDED TO PAY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RECALL TO KEEP PACE WITH THE NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. THE COMING IN ON THIS ISSUE MOVES FOR IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO BALANCE. LOW BUDGETING REALITIES AND THE CONSTRAINTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FACE WHEN RAISING REVENUE WITH CALIFORNIA HOUSING GOALS THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO EXPLORE AND BOUNCE THIS. TO BALANCE AND TO EDUCATE OURSELVES ON THE ISSUES WHICH WILL INFORM OUR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATION. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR SPEAKERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO REFRAIN FROM TALKING ABOUT CURRENT OR PENDING IMPACT FEES LEGISLATION BY NAME. TODAY FOR A IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES REVIEWS. BILLS DURING OUR UPCOMING POLICY HEARINGS LATER THIS YEAR- LOOKING FOR TO THE HEARING AND THE DISCUSSION AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE WHAT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE TO IF NOT TODAY BUT- YOU TOO. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- DISCUSSION ITEM AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AS WE'VE BEEN DIRECTED BY THE GOVERNOR AS WELL SO I THANK YOU ALL FOR. COMING TODAY. THANK SHARE. IF IT TO THE CAN WE NOW LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE CHAIR. FOR ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE. SENATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- LET ME FIRST START BY. THANKING THE FOR COMMITTEES FOR COMING TOGETHER- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO THIS MORE OFTEN BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO ADDRESS THE MOST INTENSE CRISES OF THE DAY. WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. LET ME ALSO START BY SAYING THAT I HAVE BEEN IN MOTION SUPPORT OF THE IDEA OF A DRESS HOUSING CRISIS- TACKLING TO CALL THREE PIECE- PRODUCTION PROTECTION AND SURVEY XIN AND LAST YEAR. I WANT TO THANKS ANY OF YOU THAT DID THE WORK AROUND CAPTION WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME SIGNIFICANT. AROUND AROUND. BUT WE- WE'VE GOT TO DO. OF AND I THINK THIS IS AN IN PART OF THE PRODUCTION CONVERSATION I'M ONE HISTORIC NOTE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR TODAY ABOUT HOW IMPACT FEES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL MANY INSTANCES AND HOW THEY HAVE GROWN OVER TIME I THINK IT'S NO IT'S NOT THE HISTORICAL POINT AND THAT IN THE WAKE OF PROPTHIRTEEN WITH THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT WITH FEDERAL PROGRAM CUTS. CITIES HAVE HAD TO RELY MORE AND MORE OFTEN ON IMPACT FEES TO PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WHILE IN THE PAST THE COST OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT A COMMUNITY TODAY DEVELOPERS FORMS OF HOUSING FROM PORTABLE MARKET RATE. EVERYTHING THAT I MEAN. EXPECTED TO PAY FOR PART IN SPACE ROAD TRANSIT SEWERS AND PIPES. AND CHOP AND MORE. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY WHEN YOU OF HOUSING UNITS IN MY CITY COSTING UPWARDS OF EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR. AND STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IMPACT FEES CAN ACCOUNT FOR UP TO ONE SPEAKS TO THE COST OF THAT UNIT. YOU HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENT. I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE APPOINT THE CENTER WINNER MADE ABOUT HOW. MANY CITIES ARE DOING MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND I THINK PART OF TODAY'S HEARING. IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SPECTRUM. OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT CITIES. IN SOME CITIES YOU HAVE HUGE IMPACT FEES AND OTHERS THEY'RE NOT- THEY'RE TRANSPARENCY. AROUND FEES IN MANY CITIES BUT IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN SOME CITIES FEES ARE USED TO PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BUILDING A TRANSIT. IN OTHERS THAT IS THE CASE AND I AM LOOKING. NAY TO REALLY GONNA DO YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE REACHED. HOUSE AND THE- ON ADDRESS. THIS STATE AND I'M NOT GONNA ABOUT ANY BILLS BY. ALL THANK MR GRAYSON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. I THINK- FOLKS KNOW THAT- THERE WAS ANNOUNCEMENT THE OTHER DAY ABOUT BILLS THAT WE WILL DISCUSS IN THE FUTURE. BUT TODAY- WE ARE HERE TO- TO GET A BIG PICTURE OF WHERE WE ARE TO LOOK FOR THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO CHAIR IN AGREED I THINK COMING TOGETHER- BOTH. THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE- BOTH RELEVANT COMMITTEES. IS CRITICAL IN THE FOR THE WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU HERE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE MONTHS TO COME AS THE SALOON SAID BEFORE THE HEARING. OPENING STATEMENT TO SOME. GRAYSON I THINK ON BEHALF OF EACH OF THE CHAIRS WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR- DOG AND FOCUS ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE THE FORRESTER RESEARCH. THANK YOU CHAIR OF AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HOUSING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEES FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE ABLE TO WE HAD THIS MORNING PARTICIPATE. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT FEES AND- AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ME AT MY DESK. EVER SINCE I ARRIVED IN SACRAMENTO. LAST NOVEMBER I EMBARKED ON A STATEWIDE LISTENING TO OR ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. BRINGING TOGETHER CITY. DEVELOPS PLEASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES AND SPECIAL JUST X. TO SHARE THE CHALLENGE IN OPPORTUNITIES THE- TRYING. ACROSS THE STATE. DURING FRESNO ROUND. PARTICIPANTS SHARED THERE'S CAN. THATA ONE SIZE FITS ALL POLICY IT WILL NOT HELP US ACHIEVE OUR HOUSING GOALS IN SAN DIEGO WE HEARD THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THIS CAN DO IN HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I READ THIS IN THE FINANCIAL BURDEN NEW HOUSING IN ALL OF THIS I HEARD BOTH AFFORDABLE AND RATE BUILDUPS. THOUGH IMPACT FEES AT CIGNA PASTA HOUSING. COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT MYSELF I UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SPACE TRYING TO BALANCE THEIR FINANCES WHILE WHILE PROGRAMMING OR PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT. EVER RESIST THERE IS EVIDENCE THESE ARE. AND PROJECT INTENSE BY OUR CHRONIC HOUSING SHORTAGE. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTNERS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY WHOSE FINANCING IS ALREADY STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT OUT OF CONTROL FEES CAN PUSH OWNERSHIP OUT OF REACH FOR A FAMILY THAT IS IN ME. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN WRITING HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND ATTAINABLE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WITH THAT I WOULD SAY THAT I. AM AND LOW THE PANELIST ARE HERE TO SPEAK TODAY AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO FIND REAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA YOU AGAIN. ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE IN SPACE THANK YOU SOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER AIMED TO EACH THE SIMILAR MEMBERS IN THE SENATORS WERE ON THE DICE WE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TO GET A PART IN THIS POURTANT CONVERSATION.

WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT REP SHE'S A GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE RESORTS EACH RESEARCH THAT THE LA- HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON IN REGARDS TO THE EFFECTS OF PROP THIRTEEN AND HOW IT RELATES TO IMPACT FEES. WITHIN CAN HEAR FROM RYAN. I REPRESENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON IMPACT FEES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING HE'S GONNA pGOVERN IMPACT FEES VIA- THE STATE. STATUTE AND STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WITHOUT FURTHER DO WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER TO AND MISS MORALIS YOU HAVE SEVEN MINUTES MA'AM MISTER DONE YOU A FIVE AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND HEADS UP. WE WELCOME YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING TO COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING I'M WITH AS WELL AS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS A CHAIR MENTIONED I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND CONSTRAINTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE IN RAISING REVENUES. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM. BEFORE JUMPING INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS THAT CONSTRAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW BASICS OF THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF THE HAND OUT- LAY OUT TO THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH- ARE TO PROVIDE. MUNICIPAL SERVICES THESE ARE- RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TEY SHARE THESE IN PROVIDING- POLICE FIRE PUBLIC WORKS AND OTHER SERVICES TO THE CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR- JURISDICTION. THEY PROVIDE THE SERVICES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF REVENUE SOURCES THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE OUTLINES HOW- THESE FORM MAIN REVENUE SOURCES BEING FEDERAL STATE GRANTS PROPERTY TAXES. USER CHARGES AND FEES AND THEN OTHER TAXES ARE TO COME TOGETHER TO OF THE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES THE THIRTY TWO MAIN TAKEAWAYS HERE THAT ARE OUTLINED ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. ARE THAT CITY SPECIAL DISTRICTS REALLY RELY ON USER CHARGES AND FEES BY SERVICES WELL COUNTIES RELY ON FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS IN MANY CASES TO PROVIDE. THE KNOW. ABILITY THANK HEALTH AND UP A SOCIAL WELFARE. SO I'D LIKE TO SPEND A MAJORITY OF MY TIME BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING ON PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT WALKING YOU THROUGH HOW THE STATE'S VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS HAVE EVOLVED OVER A SERIES OF DECADES. AND SO WE START HERE BY NOTING THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TAXATION AUTHORITY BUT THERE ARE LIMITS THAT HAVE SOARED CUT- COME INTO PLACE OVER. A LARGE. WINDOW OF TIME SO WE KNOW THAT PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- YOU KNOW HAD GREAT AUTHORITY TO RAISE OR LOWER TAXES BUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN NOT ONLY WAS THERE THE CHANGES TO REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHING- ESTABLISHING A TWO THIRDS VOTE A REQUIREMENT FOR STATE TAXES. NOTABLY THOUGH IN PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THERE IS NO DEFINITION THAT WERE PROVIDED TO SPECIAL TAXES THERE'S A VARIATION INTERPRETATION AMONG LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT- MOVING FORWARD. WE SEE THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THERE WAS THE FERAL DECISION THAT BROUGHT SOME CLARITY TO THE ISSUE. OF EACH CASE OTHER SEPTEMBER DISK OF. THE US DEVON FOR SPECIAL TAXES SPECIFICALLY SPECIAL TAX BEING- TAXES THAT WERE USED FORCE CIVIC. SAYS AND TO THE. IN BY. WHAT IN ON. A GROUP NEED WITH CISCO THE ASPECT TAXES ARE FIRST PURPOSES AND AS AN EXTENSION OF DISC THERE'S NO VOTER ON TO AT THIS TIME. OR AT THE TIME OF THE FAILED THIS EXCUSE ME SO WE SEE THAT BECAUSE THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN NEAR THE CITY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED ON PROPERTY TAXES HAD TO TURN TO SEEK OTHER REVENUE SOURCES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THEIR JURISDICTIONS. THE CD ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAX MEASURES COME FORWARD THESE BEING CONSIDERED GENERAL TAXES AND THEREFORE NOT HAVING. ALL OF THE LOCAL VOTERS AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE ARE APPROVING AS EXCUSE ME. INTO THIS CHANGED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE PROPOSITION SIXTY TWO. WHICH REQUIRED GENERAL TAXES TO BE APPROVED BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY. AT NOTABLY HERE THIS REQUIREMENT DID NOT APPLY TO CHARTER CITIES AND IN PROPOSITION SIXTY TWO KEPT IN PLACE THE TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIAL TAXES. THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE HAVE THE KNOX DECISION- HERE THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT THE PROPER PROP THIRTEEN RESTRICTIONS PARTICULARLY THE TWO THIRDS VOTER REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL TAXES DID NOT APPLY FOR ASSESSMENT ON PROPERTY. MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THIS PROPOSITION- MOVED FORWARD A COLLECTION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR VOTER APPROVAL BUT NOTABLY HERE IT'S WAS REALLY SORT OF A ESTABLISHED THE CONSTITUTION OF REQUIREMENTS THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD EITHER THROUGH CASE LAW OR THE STATUTE. OVER THE PRECEDING PERIOD AND O WE SEE THAT PROP TWO EIGHTEEN REINFORCES PROP SIXTY TWOS REQUIREMENT FOR A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE FOR GENERAL TAXES AND THEREFORE EXTEND THAT REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO CHARTER CITIES. WE ALSO SEE THAT PROP TWO EIGHTEEN REAFFIRMED THE FERAL DECISION REQUIRING THE A TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR SPECIAL TAXES AS WELL AS EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF A SPECIAL TAXES TO INCLUDE THOSE LEVY BY SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND AT SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. COLLEGES AS WELL. AND THEN WE ALSO SEE THAT PROP TWO EIGHTEEN ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS ABOUT WHEN THESE- THESE INITIATIVES NEED TO BE PRESENTED BEFORE VOTERS IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF ELECTIONS. AND SO WE KNOW THAT UP BECAUSE OF THESE CHANGES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD AN EASIER TIME APPROVING YOU FEES- WHICH COULD BE IMPOSED THROUGH A MAJORITY VOTE OF THEIR GOVERNMENT BODY RATHER THAN VOTER APPROVAL COMPARED TO TAXES. AND SO THEN WE THEN SEE PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX- COME FORWARD INTO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN EXCUSE ME THAT. FURTHER EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF A TAX SO THAT ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE USING TO RAISE REVENUES WITHIN CAPTURE THE DEFINITION AND THEREFORE REQUIRED VOTER APPROVAL AS WELL. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE THE UPLAND DECISION THAT CALLED INT QUESTION WHETHER SPECIAL TAXES BROUGHT FORWARD BY A CITIZENS ALSO WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTER REQUIREMENTS. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION AND UPLAND WAS NARROWLY FOCUSED TO THE TIMING OF ELECTIONS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE ROLE OF VOTER INITIATED MEASURES BECAUSE IT TO QUESTION THIS BROADER IMPLICATION WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF TESTS CLAIMS THAT HAVE FROM. BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD RIGHT BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND SAN FRANCISCO IN FRESNO- ARE JUST OR TWO EXAMPLES WHERE THE COURTS HAVE HAD TO INDIAN. WHAT VOTER INISH IT MET THERE'S- THAT GOT MORE THAN A MAJORITY BUT LESS THAN TWO THIRDS. STAND WE STOP NUMBER DISCO THE COURTS RULED THAT IT DID BUT IN FRESNO THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED THE TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT AND SO THAT YOU IS STILL AND- FOR. THE STATE FOR LOW. THAT WOULD BUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS EVOLUTION AND VOTER REQUIREMENTS SO FIRST WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A IN CREDIBLY COMPLEX SYSTEM. AND THAT IT DOES RESTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS- THERE'S THE RESTRICTIONS OR PROP THIRTEEN THE LIMIT PROPERTY TAXES BUT THEN ALSO THIS REQUIREMENT FOR VOTER APPROVAL FOR OTHER TYPE OF REVENUE RAISING MEASURES CREATES A LOT OF AND DO FOR LOCAL GOV THE THIRD AND ON OF ACTION AND IT. IS A NOT ACTORS THAT WHAT WHETHER BUT ULTIMATELY APPROVED MEASURES UNDER THEIR CONSIDERATION. IT'S ABOUT THIRTY. YEAH AND ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE DID AN ANALYSIS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ON DEVELOPER FEES AND HERE WE DID FIND THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING IMPACT FEES. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TO COVER THE COSTS OF YOU DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF PROP THIRTEEN AND HERE WE SEE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SEEKING ALTERNATIVES AND FEES PROVIDE. FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T REQUIRE THE ROLE OF THE VOTERS. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE pQUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS ROUNDS WERE GREATLY HE WILL HOLD QUESTIONS WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEES AND- I'M ATTACHES IN HIS STATEMENT AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE SIR YEAH FIVE MINUTES WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPTING KEEPING. GREAT THANK YOU MY NAME IS BRIAN AND I AM THE TERM LAW FIRM COLLEGES. THE WHAT. TO DENY. AND I'M HERE TO. STAY I KNOW THE LETTER STAFFERS PLEASE A- YOU IN LEGAL BACK HERE I JUST WANT TO HIT SOME OF THE HYPE. SISTER OF REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ARE IN THAT- DOCUMENT BECAUSE IF WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT MITIGATION FEE LEGISLATION AND LITIGATION WE- REALLY BE HERE ALL DAY. BUT I TALK ABOUT MITIGATION FEES THAT IS THIS REALLY A SUBSET OF THE FEES THAT MIGHT BE LEVIED ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS- ASIDE FROM THE MITIGATION FEES THAT ARE COVERED IN THE MITIGATION FEE ACT WHICH IS A SPECIFIC. ST OF. STATUTES IN THE GOVERNMENT CO THERE ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LIEU FEES. THERE ARE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FEES WHICH ARE REALLY SEPARATE THERE BUT THEY'RE A MATTER OF CON. LAW MORE SO THAN STE. WHEN YOU HAVE ELEMENT IN. AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER THE CITY AND THE DEVELOPER CAN ENTRENCHED REALLY ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL MISCHIEF YOU WANT. WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF THE MITIGATION FIAT CONTEXT. YOU HAVE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT IN LIEU FEES WHICH- CLEARLY SEPARATE AGAIN FROM MANY IN FEET. WE HAVE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; CáC PARK&lt;/c&gt;</u> FEES. AND YOU HAVE UTILITY CONNECTING FEES AND OTHER TYPES THESE THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MITIGATE. THE ACT. SO TALK ABOUT. ENDING TWO FEET ACTOR HELLO. OF FURTHER. UNDER THE MEDICATION FEE ACT. EXCUSE ME HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL THE OTHER FEE AND ALL THE OTHER WAYS TO HAVE DEVELOPERS PAY FOR THE IMPACTS OF THE DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE- IF YOU JUST START FOCUSING ON MITIGATION FEES YOU CAN REALLY LOSE SIGHT OF THE UTILITY CONNECTION FEES AND SCHOOLS AND OTHER FEES THAT MAY DROP OFF THAT THE PRACTICE OF HOUSING. AND JUST TO BACK THAT ORDER SAID IN A STORE ACCOUNT YEAR THERE HAS BEEN A REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP QUOTE UNQUOTE TEST FOR MITIGATION IN OTHER CITIES IN THE STATE SINCE NINETEEN FORTY NINE AND THAT WAS EIGHT YEARS FIRST VIDEO. SURGEON THAT WE A STANDARD FOR A WHILE THERE WAS ANOTHER CASE THAT CAME DOWN A FEW I THINK A COUPLE DECADES LATER THAT EXPANDED THAT. TO NOT ONLY THE DIRECT. IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO INDIRECT IMPACTS SO IF A NEW DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO CAUSE. THE CITY OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS YOU CAN GET CENTER THAT PART OF THE IMPACTS OF THE END OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT AND IN CHARGE FEES FOR THAT- FLOORS MENTIONED I THINK IS THE OVER ARCHING. THEME HERE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PASSED. OVER FORTY YEARS AGO REALLY IMPACTED THE WAYS THAT OUR PUBLIC ENTITIES COULD RAISE FUNDS. AND SHIFT FOCUS AWAY FOR PROPERTY TAXES AND MORE TOWARDS ME IF YOU WAYS. TO HIS CAR. AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH REALLY REREAD REITERATED THE HEIRS TEST FROM NINETEEN FORTY NINE AND CREATED THE MITIGATION FEE ACT AND ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THERE. AND THEN THE OTHER OVER ARCHING. RUBRIC HERE THAT- IMPACTS A LOT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE THE TWO U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS OF NOLAN AND NOLAN. AND NOLAN THE FIRST CASE WAS DECIDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND IN THAT CASE THE IT WAS ACTUALLY A CALIFORNIA CASE THE COASTAL COMMISSION DEMANDED OF A HOMEOWNER IN VENTURA COUNTY. THAT IS A CONDITION OF REBUILDING A FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BUNGALOW ON THE BEACH THAT LANDOWNER HAD TO ALSO GIVE AN EASEMENT TO THE PUBLIC TO PASS IN FRONT OF HER PROPERTY. AND SHE CHALLENGE THAT ANYONE ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME AND JUST TO SCHOOL YESTERDAY. ALL THE ISSUE OF THE BUILDING HOUSE WHICH IS GIVING THE EASEMENT TO PASS IN FRONT OF YOU AT HOME OWNERS BEACH WAS NO CONSISTENT WITH. THIS THE PERMISSION TRYING TO GET WITH THE REBUILD HER HOME BE SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A MATCH BETWEEN THE CONDITION THAT THE PUBLIC ENTITY REQUIRES. AND THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE FORMER IS TO BUILD A HOME NEEDS TO GIVE UP. AND A SECOND DON'T ADDED ON IT. NO ONE EIGHT SEVEN YEARS. WHERE'D NOT ALL THE THINK BETWEEN. FOR THE MISSION. REASON THE PERMIT BUT- ALSO REQUIRED A QUOTE ROUGH NOW BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE OR THE EXACTION AND THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECT IN THAT CASE THIS IS A CASE FROM OREGON AND A SHOP OWNER IN OREGON APPLIED TO EXPAND HER STORED TO REALLY DOUBLE IN SIZE AND TO PAY FOR PARKING LOT AND THE CITY AS A CONDITION OF THOSE THINGS REQUIRE TWO THINGS. TO REQUIRE HER TO- GIVE UP LAND FOR A PUBLIC GREEN WAY WHICH THE CITY CLAIMED WOULD HELP WITH FLOODING CONTROL AND ALSO TO PROVE- PROVIDE LAND FOR A PEDESTRIAN PATH THERE IN AGAIN THE SUPREME COURT. DECISIONS AND SAY WELL THERE IS A LINK HERE BETWEEN EXPAND STORE AND TING FLOODING IN AND HELPING PEDESTRIANS CIRCULAR ON THE AIR. BUT NO REPORT OF THE BETWEEN FULL ACTIVE X. THE ONE READ STORE AND REQUIRING THAT RETAIL STORE TO REPEAT TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF EXPANDING THIS FLOODING AREA AND THE PASSING THROUGH THE AIR. SO BECAUSE THERE NO ROUGH THE POOR. BETWEEN THE DEMANDS THAT THE PUBLIC AND HE HAD AND WHAT THE APPLICANT WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THAT WAS STRUCK DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIRTY SECONDS ARE GREAT AND JUST TO. AT THE CALIFORNIA LATER ON THAT TWO YEARS LATER IN EARLY VERSUS THE CITY OF CULVER CITY. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT LOOKED AT DOLE AND DOLE AND SAID YES THOSE OF THOSE- REQUIREMENTS APPLY HERE AND THEY TOOK A LOOK AT A TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR RECREATION FEES THE C. CULVER CITY. WANTED TO. CHARGE A DEVELOPER WHO WANTED TO TRANSFORM HIS TENNIS CLUB INTO OUR DEVELOPMENT SO IT FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LINK THE NO LOOKING PIECE OF THIS WAS FOUND BUT THE DOLAN PIECE OF ROUGH PORTION AUDI WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY IN THE RECORD SO. THAT CASE WAS REMANDED FOR FURTHER FAX AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO. ANSWER THANK YOU SO MUCH AT GRATEFUL TO BOTH YOU WITH ACTIVITIES DUE TO CHAIRSEVENTY QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO VICE CHAIR MORE. THE CHAIRS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. CHAU ASK QUESTIONS- CONSIDERING THE EXISTING FISCAL RESTRAINT THE WRIST CONSTRAINTS ON LOCAL AGENCIES WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A REASONABLE CHANGES IN STATE LAW. OR THE CONSTITUTION TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL AGENCIES TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE IMPACT FEES. THAT'S MORE OF A POLICY QUESTION IT I TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM AS SOMEBODY. WITH BAEZ'S. PUBLIC AGENCIES BUT- BUT UNDER THE DAY THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME REAL. UNDER THE MITIGATION FEE ACT THE- S. AS THE TURNER CENTERS REPORT MENTIONS THE NEXUS STUDIES THAT A LOT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES CREATE TO JUSTIFY FEES ARE OFTEN TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OLD AND THEY'RE THE INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION BETWEEN THE IMPACTS OF A NEW DEVELOPMENT AND- THE EFFECTS OF THAT DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS LINKED AS CLOSELY AS A THIRTY YEAR OLD PORT SUGGEST SO- PERHAPS DATING REQUIRE OR- ONE DOES NOT SUPPOSED TO ABOUT SPECIFICS BUT ONE OF THE BILLS IS SUGGESTING A MORE INDIVIDUAL. THE TERM. I THAT MY WAY TO GO. MISTER CHAIR. JUST A COUPLE QUICK TO THE LA- USE AT THE END OF YOUR REPORT THE CALIFORNIA IMPACT FEES ARE HIGHER THAN MANY STATES AN IMPACT FEES HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS DO YOU HAVE MORE ANY OTHER DATA ABOUT THAT THAT WE COULD RECEIVE. ALL WE- HAD TO SOME DATA AND A PUBLICATION THAT WE PUBLISH THE TIME SO WE CAN GET THAT TO YOUR STAFF THE GREAT THANK YOU. IT IS CHECK. COULD YOU OF ICE YOU'RE MORE LIKE IN OF THE SENIOR MEMBERS MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND SO WE WERE ALREADY HAD SOME REACTIONS TO IMPACT FEES. I DIDN'T HEAR EASIER IF YOU MENTION MILLER IS DISTRICTS WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT. WELL THOSE ARE ANOTHER SUBSET OF FEES THAT I KNOW SOME OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD INCLUDE IN THE CHANGES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO LIMIT MITIGATION FEES BUT MILLER RISKY THERE ARE JUST A NEWER- I GUES SUBSET OF RAISING. REVENUES TO FUND SERVICES IN NEW AREAS SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF ANOTHER LAYER ON THIS ANOTHER SUBSET OF THESE MITIGATION FEES THAT I UNDERSTAND- ALL- COVERED BY THE DILLON DILLON REQUIREMENTS IN AN EARLY THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT ONE DAY. IN A MINUTE AS IT WOULD ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO HAVE LOWER IMPACT FEES. I AM THE BUYER OF THE HOME WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE INSTRUCTOR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THEIR MILLER'S ASSESSMENT WHICH COULD BE RATHER SUBSTANTIAL THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I KNOW OF THE EFFECTS OF THAT PRACTICALLY BUT UNDERSTAND THAT WAS INTENT OF THE BELARUS ACT SO THAT WAS OUR OUR- WAY TO ADDRESS. I'M JUST WAS JUST WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED IN THE NARRATIVE SO SUBSEQUENT TO PROP THIRTEEN IN THE VOTER CARMEN'S WE DID SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO FIND THE YOU KNOW SERVICES NECESSARY NECESSITATED BY NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND SO. EITHER ONE MILLER AND OTHER IN THE PUBLICATION THAT I MENTIONED WE DID COMMENT AS WELL AND ALL THE MILLER REASON DID SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE- IN MORE RECENT YEARS AND ALSO GET THE DETAILS. TO YOU. IS WE- IS SURE BROTHER PROBABLY FULLY OUT. AND THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHY CHARGE IMPACT THESE AS MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURES IN PLACE COMPARED TO CITIES THAT ARE GROWING STILL HAVE REAL ESTATE- JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD. Y. NOS AND- WHEN WE THINK WHAT IMPACT FEES IT'S NOT JUST BUILDING NEW ROADS AND SCHOOLS IS OFTEN I'M SUPPORTING POLICE SERVICES SUPPORTING FIRE SERVICES SUPPORTING LIBRARY SERVICES SO WHEN YOU CREATE A DENSER CITY. DO NOT NECESSARILY BUILDING NEW ROADS ARE EXPANDING SEWERS YOUR OFTEN PUTTING MORE STRAIN ON LIBRARIES AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES SO- IS THERE MAY NOT BE THE LEVEL. OR THE TYPE OF IMPACT FEES YOU FIND IN LETTER BUILT OUT CITIES. WHEN YOU BUILD AN INFILL SITES IN BIGGER CITIES THERE ALREADY BUILT OUT BUT IT THE TYPES OF IMPACTS CHANGE. IN THESE OLDER CITIES. YEAH BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME IMPACT THAT OUR TRAILER FEET. I'LL GIVEN. THE ROAD SOUTH COUNTY. AND ANYBODY THAT DOES IT KIND OF A MENTOR CHECKED ANYWHERE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF A SUDDEN FINDS A BILL IN THE MAIL- THAT IS TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DEALT. GENERAL SO JUST INTERESTING SOMEBODY'S WERE AS A CANCER YOUR WHEN WE EXPANDED JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT ALL THE SUDDEN CARL'S JUNIOR WHICH IS A TEN IT GETS THIS MASSIVE BILL FOR THE TOLL ROADS WHICH HAD NO RELATION SO THERE'S LOTS OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT MAYBE EVEN AN OLDER. AGREED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BRAZIER CHARMING. THANK YOU YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THIS- AND ESPECIALLY THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE OUT WITH THE CASE THAT WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT. AT AND CENTER MORE LIKES COMMENTS ANY REYES IS ACTUALLY. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES HERE WITH HIM IMPACT FEES ARE EXACTIONS OR WHATEVER WHEN I'VE CALLED OUT. THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY. IT'S ONE THING WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEVERY L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS GOING TO CAUSE A NEED FOR MORE SIDEWALKS. YOU KNOW LINK TO IT THE THAT THAT'S- I GET THAT MORE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF IMPACT FEES AND EXACTIONS IN GENERAL. IS THAT YOU END UP PAYING FOR GENERAL SERVICES THE BENEFIT EVERYONE AND EVERYONE IS. PUTTING A STRAIN ON A SYSTEM WHETHER YOU LIVE THERE FOR FIFTY YEARS OR OR YOU'RE A NEW RESIDENT. IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THAT NEW RESIDENTS HAVE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. WHEREAS THE EXISTING RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WE'RE GONNA MAKE HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE NEW RESIDENTS. TO PAY FOR- OR PART. EMPLOYEES SERVICE TO EVERYONE. IS BETTER FROM AND IT CREATES A DISTORTION IN THE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION ON IMPACT FEES IN MY VIEW SHOULD. ONLY BE USED FOR ONE TIME- COSTS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS RELATED SPECIFICALLY. TO THAT PROJECT THE THING WHEN YOU START EXPAND IT BEYOND THAT. AND CITIES BECOME RELIANT ON IMPACT IT'S FOR A LIKE. SERVICES OUR LIBRARY SERVICES. IT IS. TIME PAYMENT IT'S NOT COMING IN EVERY YEAR THE WAY THE TAX REVENUES FROM ALL RESIDENTS COMMENT AND IT'S GONNA GO OFF A CLIFF IF THE ECONOMY GOES INTO A DOWNTURN MUCH MORE SO THAN OTHER TAXES BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT TENDS TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO DRY OUT.SO IT'S A VERY VERY SUSTAINABLE A OF FUNDING TO THE SERVICES- AND IT AND IT CAN BE EXCEPTIONALLY UNFAIR AND INEQUITABLE BY FORCING BY SAYING WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE A NEW RESIDENT YOU GOT TO PAY MORE. PEOPLE WANT TO WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW WE DO THAT WITH PROP THIRTEEN AND WE IT'S VERY UNFAIR. AND RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE MOVE AROUND THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR MOVING INTO A CITY SO IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE AE ANY MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A COMMON TO OR HAVE QUESTIONS WITH THIS PANEL AYE BORN CLOSE IN THE ENTRANCE AND THE WOMAN. JUST A COMMENT FOR THE RECORD HAVING BEYOND OUT. YOU KNOW OF LET'S SAY A VICTIM OF PRE PROP THIRTEEN PROPERTY TAXES ARE WE HAD JUST PURCHASED A HOME AND COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD. OUR PROPERTY TAXES AT THAT TIME THAT WE NINETEEN NOT. EQUAL SIXTY EARLY SO PROP THIRTEEN KING IN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE PROPERTY TAXES WERE INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY. SO I THINK WE NEED A KING AND A BALANCED OF MITIGATION FEE. INCREASED THE COST WELCOME TO KNOW CAN ON FOR TO. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS WE'VE HAD PROP THIRTEEN I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE- IT WAS A SENIOR COMMUNITIES THAT WERE REALLY HIT AND I KNOW THAT. PERSONALLY WELL MY FATHER WAS A BANKER AT THE TIME AND THE ONLY WAY WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE OUR HOME. IS BECAUSE HE GAVE US ALONE WHEN OUR INCOME WHO IS. PROBABLY LOW LOW LOW INCOME AT THAT TIME AS MY HUSBAND WAS A STUDENT AND I HAD JUST STARTED IN A JOB. IN MY MONTHLY INCOME WAS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. IN OUR PRICE TAG IS OR SOMETHING LIKE TO STOP IN AT THAT TIME. SO WE NEED TO THE- I WOULD ASSUME LEO AND SOME DO THE- FISCAL ANALYSIS. WE GO DOWN THERE ROAD GIVE US COMPARE OF WHERE WE WOULD BE. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE- MITIGATION BELARUS WAS HUGE IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY WOW THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY LOOK NOW FOR PROPERTIES THAT DON'T HAVE MEL REDUCE ARE ALREADY PAID THEM OUT. AS AN INTERN MORE LUCK MENTION BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THAT TIME PEOPLE IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON WE HERE AT THE THEIR HOMES NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE OF THEIR MIL ROUTE. WHICH WAS USED. AS ANOTHER WAY TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE'RE NOT ABOUT PEOPLE. I'M HAVING MORE. SERVICE HE WAS. THERE WAS NO THE STATION IN THE RURAL AREAS THE THREE. TO SOURCE ON FIRE. SO THE LOWERS OR TO. PO SAFETY AT THAT TIME SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BALLOT AND NOT. DEMONIZING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER BECAUSE WE GOING FORWARD THERE'S A SOLUTION I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT OR WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS ROOM. BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE GOT HERE BUT WHAT IF WE WEREN'T HERE WITH MEDICATION VIEWS WERE. PROPERTY TAXES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD WE HAVE AFFORDABLE. IN BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO NO WE WOULDN'T BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DOWN. SO I JUST ADD THAT TO OUR DISCUSSION AND I LOOK TO OUR EXPERTS TO. DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT SO WE BRING SOME BACK. TO OUR- OUR OUR FINAL- AGAIN WE WOULD HAVE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF OUR HEARINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. LAYS ENGINE THE COMMITTEES WE'RE GONNA GO TO CENTER CUT HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THAT THE TOPIC IS HOW DID WE GET HERE AND I THINK. AS A FOOTNOTE TO HOW WE GOT HERE IS THAT IS THAT IN. THE REAL. CLEAR EXAMPLE OF. HOW ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL- IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. MANY AT THE COMMUNITIES ARE BLUE COLLAR COMMUNITIES. THAT NEVER HAD ENOUGH REVENUE TO DO- THINGS THAT. EXPECTS CITIES. GOOD LIBRARY SERVICE PARK SERVICES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND IN MANY COMMUNITIES. THE CITY JURISDICTION GREW. AND INCLUDED COUNTY AND INCORPORATED NEIGHBORS THAT HAD NO CURBS GUTTERS SIDEWALKS SEWERS AND WATER SERVICE THEY WERE ON WELLS AND- YET WHEN THE ANNEXATION OCCURRED. THOSE IMPROVEMENTS WEREN'T OFFERED TO THE RESIDENCE. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE- CITY THAT WAS GROWING DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY- WE'VE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM NOW IN REQUIRE ANNEXATION BUT- I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN IN MY DISTRICT. THAT HAVE COUNTY AND INCORPORATE IT INSIDE CITY LIMITS AND THAT ARE IN ATROCIOUS SHAPE AND SO WHEN WE START LOOKING AT FEES AND- AND- I'M- I KNEW. IT'S PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU GET THE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO ADD PARK SERVICES TO ADD- LIBRARY SERVICES AND- IN IN MY COMMUNITY I RAN THIRTY YEARS AGO AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER TO EXPAND OUR LIBRARY AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH IMPACT FEES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO BUT IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS SO- SO THE CHALLENGES I THINK WE IS THAT- MEAN THERE REALLY ARE IN WHEN HE'S IN MUNICH IS IN PART OF WITH COUNCILS AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MAYBE TRYING ROUTE HOW CAN THE STANDARD UP FOR EVERYONE. AND I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE- CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS NOT ONGOING SERVICES BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR THE REST OF THE RESIDENTS BUT AYE AYE THIS IS AN INTERESTING- DISCUSSION I EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE- DISCUSSIONS ON THIS IS WE SEE SOME OF THE BILLS COME AROUND BUT- BUT I'VE BEEN SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS IN LOCAL COVER. AND PROTECT THE ABILITY ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AM SENATOR AT LAST. QUESTION FOR MR DONE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TALK TO US ABOUT SOFT COSTS VERSUS HEART COSTS. AND THEY GIVE US EXAMPLE OF THAT. 6270% OF THE HOMES COST IS GOING TO BE MATERIALS AND LABOR. AND YOU BREAK DOWN THE SOFT COSTS COULD BE 2230% IF POTENTIALLY 5% OF THAT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT- IT IS. FEES TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT. WE NEED TO RAISE TODAY- AND KNOW THAT THERE'S ONGOING PRESSURE ON THIS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE WHEN. HOUSING SHORTAGE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT SINCE YOU REPRESENT THEM WELL. AGAIN I THINK IT'S DOWN TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFILL DEVELOPMENT VERSUS. ONE ANGLER HERE. OUR THE IMPACT INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHERE YOU DON'T NEED TO EXTEND SEWER PROBABLY WE DON'T NEED TO EXTEND ROADS ARE REALLY KIND OF A- THAT IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT IMPACT FEES IN IN NUMBERS LIKE RUN NUMBERS LIKE 5% WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBDIVISION- ROSEVILLE VERSUS AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT A LOS ANGELES THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND- PROBABLY. OF THREE DIFFERENT CONSULT THESE IMPACTS AND HAVING THREE DIFFERENT RESULTS AT WHAT THE IMPACTS REALLY ARE SO WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT FEES AND WHO SHOULD BE PAYING THEM AND IN ONE WHAT TYPE TO DELIVER THE SHOULD BE READ ONLINE IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S ALL SOLUTION AS AS THE MEMBER MENTIONED JUST NOW. THERE ARE THE ONES REQUIRE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SERVICES ARE DIFFERENT IS. DIFFICULT TO SET FIRM I GUESS FLOORS OR CEILINGS HERE AS FAR AS LEVELS OF SERVICE ARE FEES ARE PERCENTAGES IN SOME RESPECTS BECAUSE THE- ALBUMS THAT WE HAVE WITH. EATING TO DEVELOP THEM EVERYWHERE IN THE GREEN FIELDS ARE NOT JUST AN INFILL SITES IT'S HARD TO HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION THAT WOULD- APPLY EVERYWHERE SO I RESPECT I RESPECT THAT THAT. FEES ARE ARE LARGE ON AVERAGE- BUT I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO REALLY TACKLE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THERE ARE NO I APPRECIATE HIM STUNT WILL ASK THAT PERSON RUNNING COME UP HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU CAN. EXCUSE ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE APPRECIATE IT WILL MOVE ON THE HIGHER NEXT PANEL I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME UP- FOR ARE GETTING WHAT YOU PAY FOR HOW ARE HIM IMPACT FEES. JOSH ABRAHAMS FROM THE PRINCIPAL FROM BEARD AND DRISKELL. VINCE WELLS PRESIDENT THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWELVE THIRTY. STEPH SANDERS LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT IMPART PLANNER FOR THE FROM THE NORTH OF THE RED RIVER RECEATION PARK DISTRICT WITH HIS MOUTH. A GENERAL HALLS FOR FROM THE SOPRANO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. AS WELL AS CHERYL CLARY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FROM THE IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT- WE CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH SEATS UP THERE. WELCOME OF JOSH IF YOU'D LIKE TO START. THANK YOU MY NAME'S JOSH ABRAHAMS I AM A CITY PLANNER AND I HELP CITIES PLAN FOR HOUSING BOTH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MARKET RATE HOUSING THEY JUST WANNA START BY SAYING THAT I KNOW FEES GET A LOT OF ATTENTION IN EVERYONE HATES THEM THEY'RE EASY TO HATE. BUT FOR THE MOST IN MOST CASES THEY'RE NOT THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS BUT STE IN FEES RANGE IN THE THREE OR 4% OF TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS. AND UP A BIG WORD OF CAUTION THAT THE CITIES THAT ARE GROWING UP FAST ARE THE ONES THAT TEND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST IMPACT FEES AND THEY USE THAT. FUN BEING TO PAY FOR THE CRITICAL OFFICER TO ALLOW EXPANSION AND THERE'S A POTENTIAL LIMITING THAT THE HE IS THE LIMIT THE FAST SAID THIS. WITH THAT SAID I WILL ORGANIZE A MY IS STILL. COMMENTS ARE THREE POINT THE FIRST IS. OF AFFORDABLE I IMPACT FEES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR TO GET NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BEFORE I GO INTO THAT IT JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT HOW. HOW THEY WORK. SO WHEN THE CITY HAS A NEW MARKET REDEVELOPMENT WILL PAY. A FEE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. THE CITIES WILL COLLECT THAT MONEY AND RELEASE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WILL SEND IN THEIR PROPOSALS THE CITY WILL SELECT ONE OF THEM AND SEND THE MONEY TO THAT TO THAT OF. A HOUSING DEVELOPER. THE OTHER ELEMENTS WILL WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT MONEY. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOP- THAT LOCAL MONEY WITH- BUT WITH PHILANTHROPIC OR FEDERAL TAX FUND DOLLARS. GETS MULTIPLE MULTIPLE. I'VE MANY TIMES IN THE ELEMENT MOVES FORWARD. THIS SITE. THE LOW MONEY IF ONE KEEP POINT IS THAT LOCAL MY IS A SENSE FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY THE FOUNDATION OF ALMOST EVERY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IS FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DOLLARS AND THE WORK AS A MATCH AND VOTE MUCH LIKE YOUR YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN EXCEPT IT'S NOT A ONE TO ONE MATCH USUALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER WILL GET MULTIPLE DOLLARS THREE OR MORE FOR EACH DOLLAR THAT THEY BUILT FREE LOCAL DOLLAR THEY PRETTY WHICH EVEN MORE WITH BACK TO ANOTHER OF COURSE ISN'T. THEY'RE SORT. I WILL NEVER PAY THE FULL SOURCE OF UP A FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEY NEED THE PROJECTS ONLY PENCIL IF THAT IF THE CITY CONTRIBUTES AS WELL AND IN ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS IS THAT LOCAL MONEY IS ONLY IT'LL PAY FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT- OR EARLY CALL FEASIBILITY THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY FOR IT AND BACK. PAY FOR IT YOU NEED THAT WOULD NEED TO LOCAL THE MONEY TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK. SO MY SECOND POINT IS GENERALLY IMPACT FEES PUSH DOWN THE PRICE OF DEVELOP A LAND THAT'S THEIR MEAN A FACT. REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS IS COMPLICATED BUT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO SALES PRICE CONSTRUCTION COSTS PROFITS AND LAND CROSS. STARTING AT THE END THE SALES PRICE IS SET BY THE MARKET THE DEVELOPER REALLY HAS VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT TO THE- IT'S DETERMINED BY EVERYONE LOOKING FOR HOUSES AND THERE'S ENOUGH HOUSES ON THE MARKET THAT IF. IF THE PRICE IS TO THE BUYER WILL JUST GO ELSEWHERE YOU CAN'T PAY MORE YOU CAN EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY MORE AND GET LESS SOMETIMES IT WORKS FOR THE DEVELOPERS ADVANTAGES PRICES INCREASED WHILE THEY'RE DOING CONSTRUCTION THEY'LL INCREASE THEIR PRICES. AND SOMETIMES IF THEY'RE COSTS INCREASE IT THEY DON'T THAT THEY'D SO THEY SUFFER. SIMILAR DEVELOPERS HAVE VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER CONSTRUCTION COSTS THERE'S NO ONE NOTHING THEY CAN SAY TO A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY TO GET THEM TO GIVE THEM A LOWER BID THOSE COSTS FROM THE DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE OUR FIX. HAS ARE THE PROFITS DEVELOPERS HAVE THEIR TARGETS AND WHEREVER THEY'RE GETTING THEIR MONEY FROM THE PENSION FUND OUR BANK OR WHEREVER. THEY ALL HAVE THOSE THRESHOLD SO FOR DEVELOPER CAN'T MAKE THAT PROFIT THRESHOLD THEY JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THE DEVELOPMENT. THE ONLY THING THE ONLY. THERE'S A YOU ROOM IN QUESTION IS PLAN PRICES WHEN PRICES ARE A DIRECT DIRECT REFLECTION OF HOW MUCH DEVELOPMENT IS POSSIBLE. SO IF CITY THESE OPENS IN DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF UNITS THERE ALLOWED. OR HOUSING PRICES. THE AND PUSH THE PRESS THE PRICE. IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE IMPACT FEES DEVELOPERS WILL DOES NOT BE ABLE TO PAY AS MUCH FOR PRICE FOR LAND AND OVER TIME THE PRICE OF LAND WILL GO DOWN. YOU CAN SEE IT FINAL SALES PRICE YOU START WITH THAT YOU REMOVE CONSTRUCTION COST IN THE PROFITS IN IN THE TOP EXAMPLES FIFTY DOLLARS I AM VERY SIMPLE NUMBERS IN THE BOTTOM EXAMPLE WE ADDED ON FIVE DOLLARS A FIVE POINT YOU'VE GOT ON FIVE DOLLARS TO THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN THE NET EFFECT IS NOT ON FOR ONE BUT PRETTY CLOSE THE- UC THE PRICES THE PRICE FOR LAND DOWN. WHICH BRINGS UP TO TWENTY THIRD POINT WHICH TO FOCUS ON THE BAD ACTORS BECAUSE WHAT'LL HAPPEN SOME TIMES IS IT FEES ARE SO HIGH THIS LAND PRICE. THE DEVELOPERS PLAN ISN'T ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY BUY THE LAND IT'S MORE IN THE PROPERTY OWNERS INTEREST TO KENYA WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING A USED CAR LOT OR A MCDONALD'S AND THEY WON'T SELL DEVELOPERS. THAT WHAT'S SO WE A- FEES PLEASE BE BEFORE AT. THE IMPACT FEES TO MAKE THAT YOUR KNOCKING THAT PREVENT NEW DEVELOPMENT FROM HAPPENING. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT ARE USING THEIR FEES TO PREVENT NEW DEVELOPMENT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALLOWING YOU DEVELOP ACTUALLY HAPPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME VINCE WELLS FROM THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWELVE THIRTY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TO THE COMMITTEE WHEN HE WAS VINCE WELLS I'M A FIRE CAPTAIN PARAMEDIC WITH TWENTY FOUR YEARS X. SPIRITS AND I WORK FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT ALSO SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF- CONTRA COSTA FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWELVE THIRTY AND I REPRESENT FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND- TO CITY FIRE DEPARTMENTS OF OVER FOUR GIN SIXTY FIREFIGHTERS. AND THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE THE PRICES OF ELATION IS VERY STEEP IT'S IN THE AREA OF FIRE PROTECTION. AS FIREFIGHTERS WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO TRENDS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER. ON ONE HAND IT'S GROWING THREAT POSED BY DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE. AND THAT'S THE WRITTEN IN OUR URBAN AND SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AT THE SAME TIME THE NEED FOR HOUSING CONTINUES TO PUSH DEVELOPMENT FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THESE HIGHLY RISKY AREAS. SAYS WE ARE DEVELOPING OUT WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING UP MORE MORE HIGH DENSITY HOUSING TALLER AND TALLER STRUCTURES SO MORE PEOPLE MORE STRUCTURED AND MORE TERRITORY TO COVER. ALL THAT TRANSLATES TO GREAT- RISA TO LIVES AND PROPERTY AND SPECIAL FAR DISTRICTS LIKE THE ONE I WORK FOR AND THE ONES I REPRESENT MEETING THIS CHALLENGE IS EVEN HARDER. SINGLE PURPOSE FIRE DISTRICT ESSENTIALLY ARE RUNNING ON A FIXED INCOME AND THAT'S JUST PROPERTY TAXES. I LIKE CITIES AND COUNTIES BAR DISTRICTS CAN'T GO OUT AND RAISE SALES TAXES- TO PAY FOR EVER EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT. AND EVEN WORSE MANY SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE STUCK WITH OUTDATED DISTRIBUTION FORMULAS ESTABLISH BY PROP THIRTEEN. EVEN WHEN THE NEW DEVELOPMENT OCCURS THERE'S NO GUARANTEE ANY ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL GO TO THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND A LOT OF THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT THE TAX RATE. IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED- BY PROP THIRTEEN SO AN AREA. THAT'S NOT EVEN DEVELOP WERE ALREADY HABITS TAX RATE ESTABLISH AN AND SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THAT DEVELOPMENT. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT. SO AS A STANDS RIGHT NOW IMPACT FEES ARE THE- THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BEGIN TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE. THE NEEDS WE FACE. FIRE DISTRICTS IMPACT FEES ARE USED TO BUILD NEW FIRE STATIONS. PURCHASED NEW APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT. AND SO TO GIVE AND I ARE YOU ALSO FIRE ENGINE IS AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT THEIR REPLACED EVERY TEN YEARS OR EVERY HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MILES. SO FOR FIRE STATIONS THERE'S A COST OF THE LAND IN THE CONSTRUCTION IN THESE. AREAS FACE AND MORE AND MORE DEVELOPMENT. AND ONCE AGAIN THEIR ESTABLISHED OF TAX RATES ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SO YOU CAN ADJUST. TO WHAT THAT COMMUNITIES GONNA LOOK LIKE. AND THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY THESE ESSENTIAL PURCHASES CAN BE MADE WITH ARE RESTRICTED OPERATING BUDGETS. JUST GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WE HAVE A COUPLE MAJOR EXPANSION PROJECTS IN GOING ON A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- WHICH IS SIMILAR GRAYSON AWARE OF WE HAVE A- CONCORD OF NAVAL WEAPONS- THAT'S SCHEDULED TO BE REDEVELOPED. AS WELL AS NORTHERN WATER CURRENT. IN A LOT OF THOSE AREAS ARE TO BE COVERED BY. FIRE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE FIRE DISTRICTS- LIKE I SAID THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE ABOUT REPRESENTING TO CITY DEPARTMENTS. AS WELL LIKE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW YOU CAN MANAGE OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT- SO AS A WHOLE RANGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THAT LET ME MOVE ON. SO WITHOUT IMPACT FEES IT WOULD BE TOUGH TO PUT FIRE AND MEDICAL PROTECTION CLOSE. TO WHERE WOULD BE NEEDED. FOR US HOWEVER IMPACT FEES IS THE ONLY WAY IS THE ONLY PART OF THE CRITICAL FUNDED EQUATION. SINCE THESE BABIES CAN ONLY BE USED FOR CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENSES THAT STILL LEAVES THE QUESTION OF STAFFING THESE GROWING DEMANDS. ALL THE FIRE ENGINES IN A ROW CAN'T SAVE A LIFE IF THERE'S NOBODY THERE STEP. SO THE LIMIT TEMPO BY PROP THIRTEEN ALLOCATIONS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAS CREATED AN IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES FOR THOSE OF US ON THE FRONT LINES. RECENTLY IN ELDORADO COUNTY OF A FIRE CHIEF ACTUALLY. QUIT TO SAVE THE OF FIREFIGHTERS JOB AFTER A MEASURE. OF FAILED OUT THERE. THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS. AGAIN CONSIDERING ACA ONE UNKNOWN- AND IF APPROVED BY LEGISLATION VOTERS IT WOULD. GIVE VOTERS AN OPTION TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE FIRE STATIONS. BUT WITHOUT A TOOL LIKE THIS WE ARE LEFT MOSTLY WITH IMPACT FEE. SO EVEN WITH THE IMPACT FEES WE STILL FACE A CRITICAL CHALLENGE. THAT WILL GROW AS DEVELOPMENT WIDENS IN THE FIRE DANGER INCREASES. BUT WITHOUT IMPACT FEES WE HAVE NO CHANCE OF MEETING THAT CHALLENGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER WELLS WILL MOVE ON TO STEPS SANDERS LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT OR PLANNER FROM THE NORTH OF THE RIVER RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT SOME AWFUL SORRY YES IT IS THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- MY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY TODAY MY NAME IS STAFF SANDERS I AM THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT IN PARK PLANNER FOR NORTH OF THE RIVER RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT. OVER LAND ACT XIN PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY FOR OUR FOR OUR DISTRICT. NORTH OF THE RIVER RECREATION PARK DISTRICT IS- WITH A SPECIAL DISTRICT THAT OVERSEES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN SQUARE MILESOF RECREATION AND PARKS SERVICES. WE ARE A THIRD DEVELOPED OUT WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS TWO THIRDS OF OUR DISTRICT IS STILL FARMLAND. WE ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THREE LAND USE AUTHORITIES WTHIN KERN COUNTY. THEY OVERSEE THE ZONING AN ORDINANCE WITHIN THE DISTRICT WE DO NOT HAVE THAT POWER. THE MODEL FOR THE DISTRICT IS JOIN THE FUN AND LET ME TELL YOU EVERY DAY IS REALLY FUN. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE CHILDHOOD THREE A LOT OF YOUR MEMORIES WILL PROBABLY BE OUTDOORS LET ME TELL YOU MINE. I GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL MINNESOTA I WAS BORN AND RAISED THERE MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD MEMORY IS WHEN MY DAD WHO IS ON THE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU MISTER WELLS FOR YOUR SERVICE. OF THEY WOULD TAKE THE FIRE INS FLOOD THE BASKETBALL COURT EVERY SINGLE YEAR ONCE A WEEK AND WE WOULD GO ICE SKATING ON IT IN OUR LOCAL PARK. THAT IS WHAT I REMEMBER DOING FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. I WANT MY CHILDREN TO HAVE WHAT I HAVE WHAT WE'VE ALL HAD WITH THOSE MEMORIES ARE. SO WHAT DO WE DO WITH OUR FEES WE BUILD MEMORIES. BIRTHDAY PARTIES BABY SHOWERS WE PROMOTE HEALTH WELL BEING FAMILIES AND BEING OUTDOORS PARKS TRULY DO MAKE LIFE'S BACK. SOME FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO DISNEYLAND BUT CAN'T GO TO A PUBLIC PARK FOR LITTLE TO NO COST. THAT'S OUR OUR COMMUNITIES WE ARE CRITICAL P. UP FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A RESIDENT. AND TELL. WE ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THREE LAND USE AUTHORITY SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON KERN COUNTY IN ITSELF. THE CURRENT RATE OF- UNDER THE OR CURRENT ORDINANCE WE ARE ALLOWED TO POINT FIVE ACRES PER THOUSAND THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER IN WITHIN THE QUEEN BEE ACT THE THREE TO FIVE ACRES PER THOUSAND. SO WHEN WE DO THAT AND WE ACT WE SET ASIDE LAND A LOT OF IT IS- I IT IT'S- HEATED. AND THEN WE GO INTO- PURCHASE WHEN WE CAN AFFORD IT. SO ON AN IMPACT FEE BASIS CURRENT COUNTIES IS CURRENTLY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PER RESIDENTIAL UNIT. THAT FEE HASN'T BEEN CHANGED FOR OVER TEN YEARS IF YOU COMPOUND THAT FEE WE GET APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY PERMITS PULLED WITHIN COUNTY JURISDICTION EVERY SINGLE YEAR- TOTALING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND A TPICAL PARK SAY BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY ACRES- WITH YOUR BASIC PLAYGROUNDS- OPEN SPACES. FIELDS IN WHICH COST ABOUT YES NO DOLLARS WITH PREVAILING WAGE RATES WHICH WE HAVE TO BE. THAT PARK TO BUILD THAT PARK WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS TO ACQUIRE THE FEES- TO BUILD THAT THAT'S TWO LIFETIMES TO CHILDHOOD'S LIFETIMES LOST OVER THAT. THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PARK SITE THAT WAS DEDICATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT THE DISTRICT ACQUIRED IN THAT LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. IT IS- IT WAS A TOTAL OF THIRTY ACRES ONLY ABOUT EIGHT ACRES OF IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IN THE TWENTY ACRES STILL. WAITING TO BE DEVELOPED WE DO HAVE FINANCING TO BE ABLE TO ARE THE FEES TO BE ABLE TO BE THAT YET COMING. AT YOU WRAPPING IT SO. TOOK A MILLION ANNUALLY THAT WE COULD PUT INTO OUR PARKS ALL OF THE PARKS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WHICH THEY ARE TWENTY FOUR. ARE HAVE BEEN BUILT BY IN A WAR WE DO NOT HAVE ANY DEVELOPER BUILT PARKS. ARE DISTRICT HAS ALSO NEVER REQUIRED REQUESTED A BOND. SO THESE IMPACT FEES QUIMBY FEES THE PARK DEVELOPMENT FEES AND GRANTS ARE THE ONLY REVENUE THAT WE HAVE USED TO BUILD A- STRUCTURE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. WE GO TO BUILD A PART WE HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE RATES INCLUDING THE PERMITS AND FEES WATER SEWER TRAFFIC ALL THAT THAT THE NORMAL CONSTRUCTION WOULD NORMALLY COST. IN IN CLOSING OF ALL OF THAT. I LOVE WHAT I DO OF I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME TO TAKE MY KIDS TO ONE OF THE PARK SITES THAT I HAVE HELPED DESIGN THAT I HAVE HELPED BUILD IT IT THRILLS ME TO HAVE MY SON ASKED ME MOM WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET A NEW PARK SITE. CAN WE GO TEST NEW PLAYGROUNDS THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF WHAT IS PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND MOVING FROM MINNESOTA TO HEAR THE BEST PLACE I FOUND IS IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE OF THE COMMITTEE. PEOPLE HOW MUCH CARE. NINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT WELCOME GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC- YES MY NAME IS TERRY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT WHICH I WILL REFER TO AS I ARE W. D. MOVIE FOR IN ESSENCE THE CFO- LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY W. E. WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL. SERVING CENTRAL. SIR HIGH QUALITY CAN WATER. WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT WE HAVE GROUND BREAKING BREAKING RECYCLED WATER PROGRAMS AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND URBAN URBAN RUNOFF PROGRAMS. AND WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS. EVERYTHING WE CHARGE BOTH CONNECTION FEES AND RATES ARE BASED ON COST OF SERVICE THEY HAVE TO BE BASED ON COST SERVICE IN MY ROLE I OVERSEE THE SETTING OF RATES AND CHARGES INCLUDING CONNECTION FEES. SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMPACT FEES AARON CONNECTION FEES. WATER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES CHARGE CONNECTION FEES THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM IMPACT FEES. IMPACT FEES ARE GENERALLY PAID TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT THINGS SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION COST. A CONNECTION BE AS DIFFERENT AS I SAT. CONNECTION FEE IS CHARGED TO COVER THE COST DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTING A PARCEL PLAN. OF A DEVELOPMENT. WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM. IT IS BASED ON THE COST OF CAPITAL THE EXACT COST OF CAPITAL. EACH PROPERTY PAYS FOR THE CAPITAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING THE WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE AS NEEDED TO SERVE THAT PROPERTY AND THEY ARE CHARGED A CONNECTION B. AS THE TERM SCRIBES. WHEN THE CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM NOT BEFORE. AND I ARE W. D. THE COST OF FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE DEVELOPERS WHO PAYS FOR CONNECTION FEES THAT'S HOW THEY PAY FOR IT. AND THE PROPERTY OWNER WHO PAYS FOR THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES IT SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY. COST THE CORRESPONDENCE CORRESPOND WITH THE DEMANDED INTENSITY BASED ON THE USE OF THE PROPERTY SO FOR EXAMPLE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES WILL PAY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DEMANDS IT'S ALL BASED ON DEMANDS OF THE SYSTEM. AND A COMMERCIAL BUILDING EQUALLY WILL PAY BASED ON BASED UPON THEIR EXPECTED DEMANDS OF THE SYSTEM. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR CONNECTION FEES ARE COST BASE BECAUSE I'VE MENTIONED THAT BEFORE. AND I ARE W. D. WE SAID OKAY IN FEES TO ENSURE THE NEW DEVELOPMENT PAYS FOR ITS FOR A FAIR SHARE IT'S ALL ABOUT EVERYBODY PAYING FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE I AM AND IT'S BASED ON THE FAIR SHARE OF CAPITAL NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICE JUST AS PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PAID FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE WELL NOT SUBSIDIZING. THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THE GOAL. IS THAT ONE PROPERTY NOT SUBSIDIZING ANOTHER SHARE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. EVERYONE PAYS FOR WHAT THEY'RE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY NEEDS ARE AGAIN EVERYONE IS PAID FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE LOOK AT CAPITAL COST FOR BOTH LOCAL AND REGIONAL FACILITIES NEEDED TO SERVE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND ALLOCATE COST ACCORDINGLY BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE SHARE. SO EXAMPLE FOR A LOCAL LOW COST THOSE ARE BASED ON THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE THERE. THIRTEEN PARTICULAR TO THAT DEVELOPMENT ORIGINAL COST WOULD BE A SEWER TREATMENT PLANT A WATER TREATMENT PLANT EVERYONE PAYS FOR PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THAT NOT JUST THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT. I'M AT A HIGH LEVEL HERE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF INFRASTRUCTURE PAID FOR BY BY CONNECTION FEES THINGS SUCH AS WATER PIPES AND SEWER LINES STORAGE TANKS PUMPING. PATIENTS AM I AS I SAID REGIONAL COST LIKE WATER TREATMENT SEWER PLANTS SO LET'S ASSUME FOR A SECOND THE CONNECTION FEES ARE CAPPED A RESTRICTED IN SOME SENSE WE SHOULD ONLY A COUPLE RECOVER COST NO MORE NO LESS NO WAY OUT AGAIN IT'S BASED ON COST AND WE'RE INVESTOR OWNED SERVICE YEAH WE'RE NOT INVESTOR OWNED COMPANY YOU'RE NOT IN IT TO MAKE PROFIT THIS THAT OUR EXIT CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR THE UN CAUGHT THE AND COSTA DEL. AND THAT'S- MY STEP. OUT BY AN- ON THAT'S OFTEN USED AND I TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT EVERY PROPERTY PAYS FOR NO MORE AND NO LESS THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHAT IS BY IN SO BY AN METHODOLOGY ALLOWS AGENCIES TO PLAN FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND COLLECT FROM THE PREVIOUSLY UNPLANNED DEVELOPMENT COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DEMANDS OF A PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT WHEN THE WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE. AND THAT'S- WE BUY IN LAND COMMUNITY DOES NOT PAY FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CHAIR OF THE FACILITIES BY IN METHODOLOGY IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED WITHIN THE WATER AND WASTEWATER INDUSTRIES BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE BEST OPTION FOR BUILDING THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE OF ALLOCATING THE COST ONLY WHEN THE PARCELS CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM. WELL BY IN THIS IMPORTANT CONNECTION FEES MAY INCREASE OVER TIME BECAUSE IT'S REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER INCREASES WE ON A REGULATIONS CONTINUE COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. SO DOES THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THOSE NEEDED REQUIREMENTS AND I ARE W. D. THE COST OF EXISTING DEVELOPMENTS BORNE BY THOSE CUSTOMERS. YOUR PROPERTY TAXES AND THE COST OF THE NEW THE CONNECTING PROP IS ARE BORN BY THIS PROP THROUGH CONNECTION FEES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND LIKE THE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK VERY MUCH MISS PERRY. WILL MOVE ON TO MY GOOD FRIEND MR DARYL HALL OF ALL SIX OF DIRECTOR OF SOLANO COUNTY TRADITION YOU FOR JOINING US. ALSO DOCTOR SERGEANT FEET UNTIL. I'M ACTUALLY TO TALK ABOUT TRANSPORT. BT ALSO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SMALL STORY ABOUT A SUBURBAN KIND OF THIS GROWING. ALSO WANTED TO KNOW SOMEONE WILL GRAYSON OR THE MEMBER COULD SEE BOTH OF YOU IN THE REST THE REST COMMITTEE. AGAIN I WANT TO THAT THE PANELS GOD THINGS THE INVITATIONS FOR IMPORTANT TOPIC. WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY THREE PORTS STORAGE FOR STORY FORCES A TALK ABOUT. OUR COUNTY GROWS- AND HOW THEY PROTECT OPENS THIS INSTANCE ON. A GIVEN YOU A COPY THIS POST COPULAR AND REPORT. OF CLARK COUNTY. OF AN ORDER GROWTH INITIATIVES THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES TO HAVE URBAN DEVELOPMENT CITIES AND JOBS IN SAID THE SEVEN CITIES. OF THE VOTERS AGREED WITHOUT THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WITHOUT AND WE TO THE TO MAKE. SUCH REAL THAT ARE LIKE IS MAKE SURE WE PUT ARE OPEN SPACE FOR. X. A WE TRY TO FOR HARD OR DEVELOP INNER CITY. WHICH RESULTED AN IT 6% OF OUR LAND BEING AGRICULTURE OPEN SPACE WATER IS ONLY 40% CITIES. 90%OF OUR POPULATIONS AS ACTUAL SEVEN CITIES SUCH. THING IS GOOD LET PLAN PARK. ON OF WHICH GETS THIS PART. OF WHICH IS WHAT'S CALLED US OPEN FACILITY. SO IN ORDER DO AS A COUNTY. SLOW CAN WHICH WAS COUNTIES GROWING THEY HAD A PER. COUNTY AND SERVICES TO SOME THE CITY OF. EVER GROWING. AND SO THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BACK NINETEEN NINETY IDENTIFIED CONCERNS A LOOK. WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH GROWTH IF HE CAN'T PLANNER COUNTY FACILITIES SUPPORT YOUR SERVICES. AND DEVELOPMENT. AND SO. RESPONSE THE CITY'S AGREED TO. COLLECT FEES TO ALSO SUPPORT. THE CAT THANKS TO A PUBLIC FACILITY FEE PROCESS. WHICH STARTED ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY TWO. AND WITHOUT THE FUNDING SOURCE THE COUNTY WOULD NOTBEEN ABLE TO DO THAT TO THE FACILITIES. SO THAT START IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT'S BEEN UPDATED BUT EVERY FIVE OR SIX YEARS ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OF THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS YOU SOME FACILITIES IN A FEW MINUTES ON A COUNTY. THE VERY GOOD LIBRARY SYSTEM. GOOD COURT FACILITIES JAIL FACILITIES. THAT'S BECAUSE DIRECTLY THE PUBLIC FACILITY FREE. I'M SORRY PAID FOR. I'M TO CLICK THE BUTTON THIRTY OF. THEY'RE YOUNG. HAVE TO WORRY HERE THESE ARE ALL OF THE COUNTIES BUT EFFECTIVELY BE ABLE TO THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS THESE FLOWS ALL EXISTING BEEN COULD KEPT UP WITH GROWTH. THE PUBLIC FACILITY FEE. HOW MUCH WOULD TWO THINGS AT ONCE OF COMPOUNDED SO. WHAT ALSO CURTIS COURSE WITH TRANSPORTATION I WANT TO KNOW SENATOR BILL IN HIS LEADERSHIP AND SB ONE- WE ALL SEE THE BENEFIT OF THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE GROWTH IMPACTS AND TRANSPORTATION. SO IN NINE AND- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS SEVEN MERS APPROACH THE COUNTY ABOUT INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION ABOUT FACILITY BECAUSE WE HAD GROWTH IMPACTS OF TRANSPORTATION- WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT A SELF OF COUNTY WE'VE TRIED THREE TIMES. THIS IS 6% NOT. TWO THIRDS. AND SO WE HAVE CHALLENGES THAT SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES HAVE IS HOW DO YOU STILL PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO FORTUNATELY- THE COUNTY WAS WILLING TO LISTEN TO OUR BOARD. INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION INFANTS AND SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW UP WHICH WE CALL THE RITUAL TRANSFERS IMPACT FEE. IT'S BASICALLY A SUBSET OF THE PUB FACILITY IS NOT A NEW FEE. A WE WERE COGNIZANT THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY MET WITH THEM WE TALKED ABOUT HIS FEET. THEY WANT TO SEE THE FEW GROW BUT HE SAID TRANSPORTATION'S IMPORTANT THAT THE DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY WANT TRANSPORTATION AT IT. MAKE A PART OF FACILITY FEE. SO WILL WE DID IS WE TOOK A SUBSET- AT THE POLITICALLY FEES IS BASICALLY ABOUT. A TEN THOUSAND DRAWING EQUIPMENT FEES WHAT THE CHARGES. IN THE TYPE OF DEVELOP. A SUBSET IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED. SHE'S FOR PETITIONS. BACK TEEN. SO IF HE'S- BY THE SEVEN CITIES AND GIVEN TO THE COUNT. PERCENT GOES TO ASK. WORK THE WAY IT WORKS IS IT'S COOL PROCESS ALSO CITIES ARE PART OF IT COUNT AS PART OF IT. A 90% COMES BACK TO THE CITY JURISDICTIONS BY WORKING GROUP AREAS BE SOMEWHERE THE FEES COLLECTED WITH DEVELOPING A CURSE. SO WE DO HAVE AREAS WHERE THERE'S MORE DEVELOPMENT TO GET. A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEE FOR THE RIVER ABOUT STRONG RETURNS SOURCE. 5% ACTUALLY GOES TO RESERVE BROWN'S IT'S THIS IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE HAVE A LOT OF REGION CHAT FACILITIES WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SUPPORT THOSE THAT'S PART OF OUR- TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. AND 5% GO TO THE COUNTY THIS WAS ACTUALLY A CITY PROPOSAL. RECOGNISING THE SOME OF THE COUNTY ROADS ARE OUTSIDE THE CITY. THE IMPACT BY THE DEVELOPMENT OCCURS WITHIN CITY SO. NINETY S. GEOGRAPHICAL 5% TO TRANSIT. 5% COUNTY ROADS. THESE ARE JUST ARE EXPECTED TO KNOW THESE DISTRICTS OF THE SHOW YOU THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE BIGGER GROWTH AREAS LIKE THE JOBS AND PARK WHERE THIS IS WHERE. A LOT OF OUR HOUSING IS OCCURRING WE GOT THOUSNDS OF HOUSING. THAT'S OCCURRING LONGER COMPLETE TREE CORTICAL JOB SOME PARKWAY. THE FEARFUL BACK LATER YOU CAN SEE ALMOST HALF THE FEET. TO BE COLLECTED THERE BECAUSE REDEVELOPMENT CURSED. GOING BACK. FOR THE QUARTER. FOR THE FOR THE- PICKS UP WITH. SHOOTING AT WHICH TO INVEST BUT IF YOU WILL. OTHER AREAS ON A LITTLE BIT SLOWER SO THEY OBVIOUSLY GET LESS FUNDING BACK. IN TERMS OF SUCCESS OF READY MADE. THE PO. FACILITIES SUCCESS FROM THE CAL. PRISON OF IN TERMS OF OUR IT DOESN'T GENERATE A TON OF MONEY. BUT IT'S LIKE A LOCAL MEASURE IT GENERATES GENERATES MONEY THAT STRATEGIC YOU CAN USE IT TO START A PROJECT. FINISH A PROJECT. LEVERAGE PROJECT. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED IN SIX YEARS SEVEN PROJECT PHASES PRODUCTS. THE PRODUCTS ARE REALLY UNDER WAY AND WE LEVERAGE THIRTEEN. DOLLARS WITHOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR TO FUND SWITCHED ITS SERVE THE PURPOSE OF. LEVERAGING OTHER DOLLAR TO DO TO INCREASE. THE INVESTMENT. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE COUNTY UPDATED THE FEE. AT THE END THERE WAS ALL REALLY STRONG PUSH FOR THE ACTION CREASES PERCENTAGE GOING TO TRANSPORTATION TOWARDS. STILL A TEN THOUSAND DRAWING AND EQUIVALENT BUT NOW OF THE FOURTH OF IT IS NOT. GOOD TRANSPORTATION STARTING THIS YEAR. WHAT WAS THE OTHER SEEN ABOUT OF THAT AND THAT. WE GO. BUT ONCE YOU'RE JUST SOME OF THE PROJECTS- YOU CAN SEE WE'VE NOTED THE CITIES OF THE RENT BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECTED ALL NOR CAN IT OUT WELL BUT EVERY IT IS A BENEFIT WHETHER IT'S BEEN A TREND TO CENTER VALLEJO SPAN A ROADWAY PROJECT IN FAIRFIELD- EVERY COMMUNITY HAS A PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT THE SHIP WITH THE COUNTY WITH US TA. WORKING THAT THE THREE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY ADVANCING ON MENTIONED JOB PARK ONLY THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT HOW IN FOSTER HEALTH MORE HOUSING HOUSING PRODUCTION. THAT JOB SOME PARK RECORDER HAS LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND BACKING FAIRFIELD. WELCOMING ONLINE. THAT NEED. HAPPEN DOES HAPPEN PHASES MS. FEE IS ACTUALLY PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THAT HOUSING BILLS ALSO BODIES HAPPEN. ONE CASE STUDY OF. I DON'T EXPECT IN A WERE REVERSED AS WELL OFF A HIGHWAY TWELVE LIMóN ISOLATED THANK YOU JOHN. IN THE AREA IT IT'S ACTUALLY A SAFETY PRODUCT ON HIGHWAY TWELVE AND IT PRIDES ACCESS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE REAR OF HYSTERIA WHICH IS GROWING QUITE A BIT AND IT WAS A- SMALL PROJECT THAT THE CITY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO FUND AND TO EASE THE IMPACT OF BARLEY CLEAR IT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE CALTRANS TO BUILD AS PART OF A SAFETY PROJECTS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT FOR LACK ACTUALLY LEVERAGING ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SHOPS AS FOUR MILLION. TO LEVERAGING IS ONLY NINE DOLLARS SHOP PROJECT WHICH CALTRANS GONNA DO THIS PROJECT AND THAT PROJECTWHICH IS GONNA FIGHT SAFER ACCESS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RIVAS OF THE TRIGGERING. SO OBVOUSLY WE'RE GETTING SOME GOOD LEVERAGING- SOMEWHERE TO LIKE. THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE'RE RECOGNIZING THE INCREASING PRESSURE INTO MASS DO HOUSING. IT'S A WERE REVISITING THE ARTIST FOR AROUND TO SAY CAN WE FOSTER PROJECTS. THAT HELP SUPPORT HOUSING PROJECTS NOT JUST. HOUSING PROJECTS IN GENERAL BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. AND IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE A TERM CALLED PRIOR DEVELOPMENT AREAS WHERE WE TRY TO FOCUS AROUND. REGIONAL TRANSIT CENTERS IN AREAS WERE ONCE YOU HOUSING AND JOBS. SO WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS OUR INVESTMENTS THERE- I JUST TALKED WITH THE COUNTY CHAU EXCEEDS YESTERDAY ABOUT. CAN WE START STEERING WARM OF THE MONEY TO THOSE PRODUCTS WERE WE NOBLES. FOUR HOUSING PROJECTS ARN'T I THINK. LIKE A LOT OF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING. MY AGENCY NO ACTUALLY DOES A RE SCORE CARD. FOR COUNTY. I CAN TELL YOU WHERE WERE OUT FOR SEVEN CITIES IS. WERE MEETING ARE. TARGETS WERE. MODERATE LIKE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING WITH FOR ABILITY HOW TO GET THE AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS TO PENCIL OUT. AND SO THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS ON HIS CAN THE ARTIFICE COULD BE IN THE FUTURE IS. FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS WHERE. WE KNOW WE WANT TO. DEVELOPER QUE CANCEL OUT. HE'S GOT PARTNERSHIP. WE INVEST ENOUGH. MAKE TO DIG INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS A COPY OF THE AND REPORT FOR SIX YEARS THERE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU MISTER HEALTH I AM NOW OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS AND SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU OFFERED THE- INTERESTING PRESENTATIONS- FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT GREAT PROJECTS IN EUROPE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES SO- MY QUESTION IS FOR MR ABRAMS- I DON'T THINK YOU USED THE TERM BAD ACTOR CITIES- IN YOUR PRESENTATION BUT YOU DID AND FOR. THAT THERE WERE SOME CITIES THAT ARE USING IMPACT FEES TO STOP DEVELOPMENT- CAN YOU PLEASE ADVISE US. WHAT THE CHARACTERISTICS. OF SUCH A- A GALA. WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE WELL I THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF GETS TO THE TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER HERE HOW WOULD WE AS LEGISLATORS IDENTIFY THOUGH CITIES SO WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THANK YOU THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK IT'S A LITTLE HARD BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THOSE FEES ARE HIGH AND BUT IT'S ALSO A HIGH GROWTH CITY ONE OPTION TO DO THAT WOULD BE LOOK LOOK AT CITIES THERE REALLY AREN'T PRODUCING MUCH HOUSING AND HAVE REALLY HIGH IMPACT FEES- ANYTHING WE ALREADY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THEIR WITH THE WITH THE RENO AND THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE REPORTS. EVEN SB THIRTY FIVE WHERE THERE'S CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT MEETING AND ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO LIMIT IMPACT FEES THE CITY REALLY AREN'T AREN'T. MARK PRODUCE. BUT STILL HAPPILY HIGH FEES. CHIU JUST A REALLY QUICK QUESTION ABOUT ME FOR SURE HANDS AND BY THE WAY I THINK MOST OF US HERE IN THE DíAS WE'VE ALL BEEN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WE ALL ABSOLUTE PRECIADO IN VALUE THE WORK YOU'RE INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES ARE DOING FROM FIRE FIGHTING TO PARKS TO TRANSIT TO WATER UP MY FIRST QUESTION JUST SORT OF A SHOW OF HANDS. IN YOUR RESPECTIVE REGIONS HOW MANY OF YOU WORK WITH YOUR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER AREAS SO IF YOU'RE IN FIRE FIGHTING YOU WORK WITH PARKS FOLKS TRANSIT FOLKS WATER TO TALK ABOUT COLLECTIVELY ALL THE IMPACT FEES THAT YOUR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE DOING OR DO YOU JUST FOCUS ON THIS WITHIN YOUR WORLD I'M JUST CURIOUS SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY YOU COORDINATE ACROSS. OKAY AND THEN ALSO. BY CHAU HANDS. I KNOW YOU DO INDIVIDUAL NEXUS STUDIES TO FIGURE OUT- THE COST FOR PARTICULAR IMPACT FEES. DO ANY OF YOUR CITIES DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF NEW DEVELOPMENT BE ABLE TO PAY THOSE FEES SO LOOKING COLLECTIVELY ACROSS THE CITY. WHAT THOSE FEES ARE AND WHETHER. PROJECTS CAN PENCIL OUT IN YOUR REGION'S. CARRIES OF ANY- JURISDICTIONS TO THAT. OKAY AND IF AND IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YOU WANT TO MAKE ON EITHER OF THOSE QUESTIONS. LOVE TO HEAR BUT HERE THAT. AND SAYS CITIES DO THAT. CITIES DO NOT BEND ON BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS SO THERE'S DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LACK OF COORDINATION ACROSS. SERVICES THEY'RE ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE ANALYSIS OF WHETHER COLLECTIVELY FEES ARE- ARE ARE STYMIED HOUSING PRODUCTION SO JUST TRYING TO GET A HANDLE OF. WHAT THAT'S LIKE. WHAT TO MAKE WHAT I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS MORE RECENT. AT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WITHIN OUR COUNTY. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE FOUR WALLS OF PRODUCTS HOW PENCIL OUT SO. WE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP ACTION BOARD TAUGHT US TO A WITH OR SEVEN CITIES IN THE COUNTY. TRY TO ADVANCE PRODUCTS SUCH POP WE ONLY FOUR MONTHS OLD. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH- BUT WOULD BANG UP IT GETS ISSUE JUST SAYING AND SO WE'RE WORKING SEVERAL DEVELOPERS UPSET PROJECTS. AND WHERE OUR- ALEX HAPPEN. OTHER DEVELOPED. THE A SERVER FARM AND IT THANK YOU KNOW COUNTY WELL WE'RE PRICE THE BAY AREA BUT THE DEVELOPMENT CAN VIEWS A AS SINGLE FAMILY MARKET RATE HOUSING COUNTY TRYING TO ATTRACT OTHER DEVELOPERS A CAN COME IN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF PRODUCT SO BUT I THINK IT'S- STILL FAIRLY READ. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST MOTHER SAYS TO DO IT. ONE OF THINGS ALSO ABOUT THAT IS- OBVIOUSLY IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS HAVE TO PAY EXACTLY THE SAME IMPACT FEES AS MARKET RATE UNITS EVEN THOUGH. AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPERS AND- AND- PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY BENEFIT CHOIRS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SO- HYPOTHETICALLY THERE MAY BE A BILL MOVING FORWARD- THAT I MAY BE INVOLVED IN TO LOOK AT. CHIU JUST LOVE TO CONTINUE ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION THE PERFECT TIME. THE BILL. YEAH THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK. OF IN TERMS OF- HOUSING AT THE VERY LOW INCOME LEVEL CAN YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU IS THERE ANY DETERMINE AT THAT. FEES SHOULD BE. WAVE REDUCE. FOR THOSE KINDS OF REALLY. MAYBE FOR BELOW 50% OF MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME HOUSING IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND- DO YOU HAVE A FEE SYSTEM THAT'S BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE OF THE PROPERTY OR IS IT BASED ON A PER PER UNIT LOOK UP COST. SO MAYBE RESPOND TO THAT. I'M STILL SO- YEAH I THINK IT'S A BEST PRACTICE TO REDUCE FEES FOR AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS% THEY THINK SOME CITIES HAVE POLICIES ABOUT IT MOST DO IT IN PRACTICE BECAUSE IF THE CITY IS PUTTING IN MONEY ANY WAY YEAH. IT'S JUST AN ACCOUNTING THING FOR THEM TO REQUIRE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. TO PAY WHATEVER OTHER IMPACT FEES BECAUSE THEN THE DEVELOPER WILL NEED MORE MONEY TO MAKE THEIR THEIR- DEVELOPMENT ITSELF BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A GOOD. A GOOD SPROUT. MOST DEE IS WILL HAVE THEIR FEES JUST BASED ON EITHER- PER UNIT OR- PER SQUARE FOOT. SOMETIMES I'VE SEEN CITIES TRYING TO- IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES PRICE BUT IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL THE END AND SO MOST CITIES DON'T DON'T USE THAT METHOD SO. PER UNIT. BY DEFINITION DISCRIMINATES AGAINST AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE A VERY HIGH COST HOUSING UNIT VERSUS A- STUDIO APARTMENT OR A LOWER COST UNIT. IT IS IT PER PREVALENT AT THE USE A VALUE OR A PER UNIT PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE FEES. YEAH UNDERSCORE SAY YES ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEES YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING ABOUT IMPACT FEES GENERALLY. WELL I SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I'M ALSO- WANNA KNOW GENERALLY IS THE PRACTICE TO USE THE VALUE OR IS IT APPROVED- OUTDOORS IS THE FEE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. OR ISN'T BASED ON. YEAH LIKE A BUILDING PERMIT IS BASED ON VALUE RIGHT BUT YOU GET A BUILDING PERMIT HOW MUCH IS YOUR PROPERTY HOW MUCH IS THE CONSTRUCTION COST YOU GET IT YOU GIVE YOU PAY BUILDING PERMIT. ON THE VALUE OF. OF THE CONSTRUCTION. IN THEORY THE IMPACT FEE IT SHOULD BE MORE TIED TO THE IMPACT OF SO THERE'S A GOOD LOGIC FOR CHARGING MORE FOR LARGER DEVELOPMENTS- AIMED AT WHAT PERSON JUST CITIES I DON'T KNOW THE PERCENTAGE I MEAN I COULD LOOK FOR THE CITIES THAT I HAVE DATA POOR BUT IT'S PRETTY. IT'S BETWEEN THE TWO BOTH AND YOU SEE BOTH THE- PRETTY COMMON BUT THERE'S NO- HAVE HAVE COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHED A- DISCOUNTING OR- A PROCESS TO WAIVE FEES FOR VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING THAT THAT IS RELATIVELY COMMON IT'S EITHER COMMON IN PRACTICE THAT THEY DO IT OR SOME OF THEM HAVE IT EXPLICIT IN THE CODE. OKAY THANK YOU. IF I MAY ADD TO THAT- WE HAD WITH THE THREE DIFFERENT LAND USES STORIES THAT WE'VE COME UPON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSION THERE BUT THIS HASN'T COME ACROSS THE BOARD WE DID HAVE. SOME HOUSING THAT CAME ACROSS WITHIN THE DISTRICT IN THOSE PARK FEES WERE NOT WAVE JUST BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF DENSITY TO. RECREATION PARK SERVICES SO IT IS A FOUR FEET WITH LARGE DISTRICTS. OVER THE QUEEN BEE FEE IS DONE THE VALUE OF THE LEFT HAND AND THEN HOW MANY PERSONS PER HOUSE THERE IS A FOR WHAT THE DEAL. IS A FORMULA THAT INTO PLAY. RIGHT NOW HE SAID I. THREE PEOPLE PER CALL SO WHEN YOU AT THOSE IS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SO AND WHEN YOU WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- PROBLEM THAT WE DO HAVE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO INCREASE DENSITY WITH THESE IT IT WITHIN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING BUT IT ALSO DOES TAX SERVICES THAT WE HAVE. TO USE  THREE POINT ONE. YOU YOU YOU FOR ANY HOUSING PROJECT ANY BROWSING CORRECT IF I BUILD A BUNCH OF STUDIO UNITS FOR. SOON TO BE HOMELESS EOPLE WHICH MAYBE BE WATER AT THE MOST TO PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO. THAT WOULD PER PERSON BE A TAX IT WOULD BE HIGHER PER PERSON THAN THAN THE OTHERS IN THAT WOULD ONLY BE RELEVANT FOR THE QUEEN BEE AT THE PARK DEVELOPMENT FEE EXCEPT HER UNITS. NINE UNITS BASICS THE QUEEN BEE ACT IS BASED ON THE FORMULA WITHIN OUR JURISDICTIONS OF THREE POINT ONE. PER HOUSEHOLD AND TWO POINT FIVE ACRES PER THOUSAND. YES OKAY I THINK I THINK THIS JUMBLE NEEDS TO BE KIND OF LOOKED AT TERMS OF. DOES IT DISCRIMINATE OR NOT DISCRIMINATE ON. AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ESPECIALLY. UNITS THERE ARE OR- SINGLE PERSON ORIENTED NON FAMILY TYPE OF UNITS YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD TO SAY THE- PROVIDE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DEMAND THAT WE ELIMINATE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. HELLO THE UNITS ARE GONNA BE OCCUPIED BY SINGLE PEOPLE. MAYBE TWO PEOPLE WITH MOSTLY ONE PERSON BUT THEY'RE CHARGED BASED ON. THE STANDARD FEE WHICH IS SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE THREE OR MORE PEOPLE IN THE- SO I THINK I THINK THAT TO BE LOOKED AT. SEC SKINNER. THANK YOU AND- APPRECIATE SENATOR BILLS- QUESTIONS IN THE CLARIFICATION AROUND WHETHER IT'S THE UNIT OR THE NUMBER THE VALUE OF THE UNIT OR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MIGHT OCCUPIED UNIT BECAUSE CLEARLY THIS REALLY IMPACTS THE ULTIMATE COST OF THE UNIT AND THUS THE AFFORDABILITY OF IT. AND THIS IS ONE OF THESE. WE'RE IN A. WE JUST HAVE THESE KIND OF PERVERSE. PROGRAMS IN IN A FUNNY WAY IN THAT YES BECAUSE OF PROP THIRTEEN AND OTHER ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING COMING INTO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COVER. A LOT OF THE BASIC SERVICES THAT ARE RESIDENTS EXPECT IN YET WE ALSO HAVE A- NEARLY CRITICAL HOUSING SHORTAGE IN IT IS NOT ONLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT IS HOUSING GENERAL AND WE HAVE OUT MIGRATION NOW. IN THE BAY AREA FOR SURE I HAVEN'T LOOKED QUITE AT THE NUMBERS IN CASH LA AREA BUT LA IS NOW. JUMP TO THE BAY AREA IN TERMS THE- RISING COST OF HOUSING WE WERE THE WORST MEANING THE BAY AREA AND NOW ELOISE JUMPED US SO IN THAT IN THE OTHER IRONY OF THIS IS THAT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND TO DO THESE IMPACT FEES CANNOT LIVE. COMMUNITIES THAT THEIR BODY THIS SERVICE SO OUR TEACHERS PUBLIC KEY PERSONNEL MANY OUR ANYWAY SO WE WERE JUST IN THIS- CRAZY CRAZY SITUATION. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE- THEY NEED TO FIND THE SERVICES I WONDER IF. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER A MORATORIUM ON FEES FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME FOR EXAMPLE FIVE YEARS- ON MY BILL LAST YEAR WAS LOOK LOOKING AT TRYING TO GIVE A GREEN LIGHT TO THE HOUSING THAT ARE JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY SAID YES TO SO IT'S ALREADY APPROVED IMPLANTS DOESN'T EVEN NEED. YOU KNOW EXTRA CHANGES IN ZONING RULES OR OTHER RULES AND I INCLUDED IN THAT AND WHAT'S FOR ONLY A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME FIRST TIME. TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS AND I THINK NOT ONLY A WERE MORE TOWARD ON JUST SO WE COULD DEALS A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS CRISIS AND COURSE THAT GOT TAKEN OUT THE BILL. SO NOW THE GREEN LIGHT BUT WE KNOW THAT SOME PROJECTS ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD JUST AS THE OF. SO HI NOW. AT THE END. IT JUST DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THE DEFENSE. NO BUT BE ABLE. AFFORD THE HOW ONCE COUPLE SO REGION IN THIS REALLY TRICKY SO OUR VOTERS OF COURSE WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO YOU KNOW HAVE JUST MADE TO PROP THIRTEEN IF THEY SO CHOOSE IN NOVEMBER THAT MAY CHANGE THE WORDING PICTURE FOR OUR LOCAL SERVICES- BUT I THINK OUR NEED TO ACT AROUND THE ICING HOUSING CRISIS IS NOW BUT I WONDER IF ANY. ONE HAS COMMON EVEN. ATTEMPTS CAPPER MORE TO ON THE CITY'S. US BECAUSE FOR THE FIRE DISTRICTS AND IN CONTRA CSTA COUNTY THERE ARE TWO FIRE DISTRICTS THAT ARE. OF A BASED ON THE PROP THIRTEEN OUR WAY UNDERFUNDED- THE AVERAGE RATE OF THAT ONE PERSON THAT GOES TO FIRING CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IS A PROXIMITY ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS TO THE DOLLAR. AND I'VE TO AGENCIES WHERE ONE IS SIX CENTS ON SEVEN AND ONE OF THOSE AREAS- PASSING UP PARTIAL TAX. IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE HE'S CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THEY'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE BUT HE IS WHERE WE'RE DRIVING AND RIDING ON- ENGINES AT- YOU KNOW WAY OVERDUE FOR EXCHANGE WITH THE FIRE STATIONS THAT ARE FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD JUST THROUGHOUT. THE COSTA COUNTY SO. NOT HAVE IT. THE FEES AND BEING ABLE TO PASS ANY KIND OF MEASURE TO- DIGITALFUNDING I THINK A CAP ON THE FEES OR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. DEPENDING ON THE AGENCY. RIGHT NOW THOSE- THE QUEEN BEE FEES THAT WE GET IN AND THE PARK DEVELOPMENT FEES FOR US ARE THE ONLY REVENUE THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF GRANTS FOR PARK DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S NOT I MEAN IF THEY DON'T TOUCH ON MAINTENANCE OR ANYTHING SO THAT WOULD COMPLETELY PUT A STOP. TO PARK DEVELOPMENT. MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH CITIES WHEN THEY WANT TO INCREASE FEES IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS THAT ARE REALLY UPSET BY IT ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THE LAND BECAUSE INVEST. KING ABOUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THEY'RE GONNA BE STOCK AND THEY HAVE NO WAY. OF REDUCING OF THEIR LAN ACOSTA USING THEIR OTHER COSTS IF THEY HAVE AN UNEXPECTED COST. THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HURT THEM. BUT THE MOST PART ASSUME THESE ARE OR HARDER. I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPER OPPOSITION A LOT OF DEVELOPERS COMING OUT I MEAN SOME. TALK TO IT THEY'RE JUST THEY JUST SPECIFICALLY IT JUST THE LAN PRICE AND NOT. IS OF ALL OF THE ISSUES WITH- ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND UP THE BUILDING CODE AND RESTRICTIVE ZONE AND TOO MANY THINGS AND LIKE AFTER HOURS IN ISSUE. FOR MOST OPPOSITE THAT I'VE SEEN IS. IT'S BUT IT'S JUST NOT IT'S JUST PRIOR. DRAWS. JUST ALONG THOSE LINES AND THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER AND MR ABRAMS- FOR THAT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND REALLY WHAT ROLE DO FEES PLAY IN HURTING THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. I MEAN I THAT'S THE SORT OF FOR ME A BOTTOM LINE QUESTION IS IT DEPENDS ON HE REGION IN THE STATE IS THAT ACROSS THE BOARD I MEAN BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT THIS AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE. A FALSE SORT OF CHOICE HERE OF LOOK AT ALL THE SERVICES ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE DONE ON AND HOW AND THEY RELY ON THESE FEES AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IT IS THIS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. THAT IMPACTS THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. FOR ME THAT'S A BIG QUESTION. SO I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON. THE CITIES AND THE AREAS THAT ARE DOING THAT LIVE NEED THESE FEET. WEATHER'S FOR FIRE SERVICES ARE. ARE ARTS WHAT WHATEVER HOWEVER THEY BEING USED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I WANT TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON THEM IF IN FACT IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP US. ON THE ISSUE- PRODUCING HOUSING WHETHER IT'S MARKET AND OR AFFORDABLE BUT ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE SO ANYBODY'S. THE JOB ANYTHING TURNER CENTER IS GOING TO BE THE BEST PLACE TO TALK TO BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO AID BUT I WOULD JUST FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S JUST A HANDFUL OF CITY IS A I DON'T WANT TO BE SORT OF ITS PROPOSED GROWTH CITIES THAT WHAT THAT HAVE REALLY HIGH FEES DO YOU THINK IT'S A PROBLEM DO YOU THINK THE STATE HAS STRONG ENCOURAGED HOUSING I. WANTED WILL CITIES THOUGH ENTIRE CITY STILL HAVE IS IMPACT FEES BUT- IN I THINK. IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WHERE I DO A LOT OF WORK I WOULD SAY THERE'S ONE CITY THAT I THINK IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN. BUT IT'S ONE OF TWENTY ONE SO I THINK IT'S NOT THE CAN IT'S LIKE IN THE LIST OF CONCERNS WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE'S A WAY TO TAILOR IT TO THOSE THOSE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. LISTA EARNS A JUST. ME BALANCING OUT ALL THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. I THINK. THAT IT'S A IT'S A FAIR BALANCE WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. SURE I'M AYE AYE AYE TENDER CONCUR I THINK MOST OF THE CITY'S WANT TO BUILD A HOUSING. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE HELP THEM DO IT I DON'T THINK THE FEES BY THEMSELVES OF THE PROBLEM I THINK I SHOULD REVIEW VISIT THEIR FEES AND TRY TO STRUCTURE PHASES OF THINGS ARE BILLS WOULD INTO. BUT I THINK WITH THE STATE'S DOING WITH SB TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH COUNCIL FUNDS MAKE FUNDS. AVAILABLE SO WE HAVE A PROJECT. THE CHALLENGES WE ALWAYS. PROGRAM GRANTS ARE CERTAINLY FOR DEVELOPER IF YOU WANT TO. GET THE DEVELOPER JUST COMMIT THEY KNOW THE STATE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR SURE IF THEY COMMIT THE PROJECT WALGREENS HE COMMITS THE WHATEVER THE FEE SCHEDULE IS AND THE AND THE STATE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SURE IS FOR CERTAIN THEN AND YOU'RE GONNA GET PROJECTS AND SEVERAL PRODUCTS ARE CUED UP. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GROUNDS TO GO FOR A MINUTE. ADAM I DO A HANG IN THERE ARE NOT. THAT'S LITERALLY THE WERE OUT TO RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT BROAD. WE KNOW WHAT GAP ISN'T REALLY GAP FUNDING. THE ONE FOR HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE WRITER YOU GOT ADDRESS THE GAP FUNDING. AND IT COULD SOME OF THAT BE FEE REDUCTIONS IT COULD. BUT THEN YOU HEAR ALL THE REASONS WHY GOOD CAREFUL SHE REDUCE TOO MUCH TO YOUR SERVICES AND SO. ABOUT ACT. RIGHT IN THERE OTHER. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR CHERYL KEY JUST TO. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IN YOUR UP OF. THE OF WATER SUPPLIER OR WATER WATER AND SEWER WATER MISERS PRIMARILY WHAT DO YOU GET YOUR WATER FROM CNSERVE THEM SO WELL WE HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF WATER WE GET. OUR WATER COMES FROM GROUND WATER WELLS. COMES FROM- IS IMPORTED WATER AS WELL AND ABOUT 25% COMES FROM RECYCLED WATER. OKAY AND- THE OTHER QUESTION IS HAVE YOU SEEN AN INCREASE OVER THEYEARS I MEAN IT INTERWEAVING FEES IT CHRIS RIGHT ELECTION ONCE YES. YOU KNOW WE HAVE IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND AGAIN IT'S ALL RELATED TO THE COST TO CAPITAL SO THE COST TO SUPPLY IN FIRST TO GET THE WILL. AND THE SEWER SERVICES TO A NEW DEVELOPMENT. AND WHAT WE DO- INITIALLY BE EAGLE ON PROJECT FEATURED. AND WE BASED OUR K. R. CONNECTION FEES ON THAT BACK TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EVERY SINGLE YEAR YEAH SOMETIMES CREE SOMETIMES THEY THEY DECREASE BASED ON X. DID PROJECTED YEAH AND THEN THOSE DEVELOPER PAY THE CONNECTION FEES AS THE ACTUALLY CONNECT SEWER SERVICE FOR WATER SERVICE. NOT PAY. QUE CONNECT. IT DOES THANK YOU VERY WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IN YOUR COMING TO EDGE ALL US UP HERE SOME OF THE AND THEN WE'LL MOVE OVER TO SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU SO OUR NEXT PANEL- WHICH IS IN TOTAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPACT FEES GOOD PRACTICES AND INNOVATIONS SO I WILL HAVE THREE- WITNESSES. SO CALLED NOW ONE PER AS TO SEE IF SYSTEM COUNTY EXECUTIVE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY- DAVID ARE GOING WHOSE INSISTS CITY MATTER- IN SANTA ROSA. AND TOM PAY SUPPLYING DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND EACH WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES OUT THAT THE- THIRTY. GO AND WHICHEVER ORDER YOU LIKE. THE MORNING A CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'M ONE PER AS- WITH THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE OVERSEE THE TRANSPORTATION I MANAGEMENT- AGENCY FOR THE COUNTY. ALSO THAT OVERSEES OUR GROWTH IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS- JUST A FEW THINGS TO KIND OF HELP SET THE STAGE FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WHERE THE FOURTH LARGEST COUNTY BY SIZE AND POPULATION IN THE STATE. WHERE THE TENTH- MOST POPULOUS IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWENTY AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PRESIDENT A GROWTH IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO DO TODAY. PERSPECTIVE AS IT COUNTY THAT HAVE GROWN WE'VE DONE IT. IS TO HAVE BOTH. BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY. SO THE COUNTY ACT GIVEN- IT'LL BUT HOW WE GOT HERE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING REALLY FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AS AS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GROW BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE LAND I SHOULD MENTION THE SEVENTY THREE CORPORATE MILES OF THE SITE OF THE COUNTY OVERALL SO THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE NEW JERSEY TO KIND OF GIVE YOU A CHECK. THE GEOGRAPHY TRYING TO COVER. OUR POPULATION THE CORPORATE. ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT IT IS SPREAD OUT OVER EIGHTY PLUS DIFFERENT ON CORPORATE A COMMUNITY THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTIGUOUS LAND MASSES. IN THE IN A CORPORATE ACCOUNT THAT WE SEE IN OUR CITIES. WHICH POSES A CHALLENGE AS FAR AS INFRASTRUCTURE- SO LOOKING AHEAD THE CASE YEAH NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TO PLAN FOR THIS GROWTH WE HAD. WE HAVE TO WE CALL TOM PHùTRANSPORTATION FOR MEDICATION FEES THAT APPLY. NOT JUST TO THE COUNTIES BUT TO OUR TWENTY CITY COUNTY UNIFORMLY. AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM. IN WEST DOWN NOT IN THE- ALLEY. THE ABOUT IT I AM BACK IN MAY. NINE WITH THE FIRST OF IT. COUNTRY IT WAS A FOR TIME THERE WAS A- REGIONAL FREE PER AND IT WAS IT WAS ADOPTED AND PARCEL OF OUR SALES TAX MEASURES ARE SO WHERE SELF ALL COUNTY- SO PART OF THE DISCUSSION AT THE TIME WITH THE VOTERS WAS. AND IN ORDER TO ENACT THE SALES TAX OF THERE WERE ALSO BE VEHICLES AS PART OF THAT TO BE A- PLAN FOR GROWTH. COACHELLA BEYOND TIME FOR BI PART OF THAT- AND THEN SOON THEREAFTER ON SHOW YOU MORE IN A MINUTE HERE WESTERN COUNTY FOLLOW ALONG WITH OUR PROGRAM. IN THIS LETTER OCCUR HELLO MY ONLY. AND TO. YOU KNOW. PETITION WILL HAVE AT THE COUNTY OR AND IN INDIVIDUAL CITY LOVE WE MIGHT OR ON THE IMPACT FEE PRO TO COVER OTHER THINGS UCH AS PARKS- PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT INCLUDE FIRE AND POLICE FACILITIES- AND THOSE TYPES OF OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE THAT ARE NEEDED BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE FOCUS IS. BUILDING NEW. SYSTEM FIND ON OPERATIONS THEY ARE VERY CLEARLY IMPACT FEES THAT MEET ALL THE NEXUS REQUIREMENTS- SOFOR US IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IT'S REALLY BAD AND PART AND PARCEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN A CAN. READ OR NOT AN IMPEDIMENT TO OUR GROWTH WE WOULD NOT. BE HERE TODAY- WITH THE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE WITHOUT THE FEE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ALLOWED US TO PUT. SECOND STRUCTURE. AND TO BE TO MITIGATE OUR GROWTH AS WE GO ALONG YOU SEE THERE BEFORE YOU. LITTLE BIT OF A SLOW JOHN CAN HAVE HISTORICALLY SO WE'VE ADDED A BOTTOM MILLION RESIDENTS- ABOUT A 60% GROWTH RATE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS NOW THINK ABOUT THE RECESSION AND THE IMPACT THE REPRESSION EVEN FAT FACTOR AND WE'RE STILL AVERAGING AROUND 3% GROWTH A YEAR IN THE CAT. AND WHAT TRY TO HIGHLIGHT IS AS THESE PROGRAMS HAVE COME INTO PLACE. YOU ARE SEEING A CONTINUED GROWTH AND THE PROGRAMS ARE HELPING US PROVIDE THE MITIGATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDE THAT GROWTH THEY'RE NOT A BREAK THERE ARE A WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S ROADS. OTHER FACILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE HOUSING. AND THE REASON FOR THAT AND WHY THE REGIONAL MODEL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR US IS THAT THEY PROVIDE A WAY FOR US TO. SHARE OUR COST PROPORTIONALLY. VERY DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU HAVE AREAS THAT ARE SEPARATED BY GEOGRAPHY TO BE THE FIRST BUILDER INTO AN AREA YOU HAVING A PROHIBITIVE COST TO TRY TO CONNECT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. BY BEING PART OF A REGIONAL PROGRAM IF YOU AN AVENUE. TO EITHER PUT IN THE INSTRUCTION THEN BE REIMBURSED OR FINANCE THE COST THROUGH. THROUGH THE BOND MEASURES WHAT HAVE YOU OVER A WIDER POOL OR BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THE INSURMOUNTABLE FIRST COSTS THAT WE CAN SEE AN ERROR THIS. ONE SPEC AT REALLY HASN'T. SO FAR BUT I WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU COMMITTEES ARE AWARE OF AS WE ALSO USE THESE PROGRAMS AS A WAY TO PROVIDE CUMULATIVE MITIGATION THERE ARE UNDER SEAQUEST S CALIFORNIA BERMAN QUALITY ACT RECALL AS US TO LOOK AT NOT JUST DIRECT IMPACTS PROJECTS BUT WHAT OF IT SOMEHOW PROJECTS FIT IN WITH OTHERS THAT ARE APPROVED AROUND. AND THIS IS A OF TO SEE HOW WE DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES OF COMMITTED MITIGATION. WE HAVE ALSO USES PROGRAMS VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO MATCH OTHER DOLLARS WITH ITS FEDERAL OR STATE DOLLARS AS WELL. AND WE'RE SO- USE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE- WE HAVE A AN OPEN SPACE. WE HAVE TO OPEN SPACE PROGRAMS AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THEM IN A MINUTE THAT ALLOW US TO SET ASIDE OPEN SPACE MITIGATE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AS WE GROW AND WE USE THOSE TO ALSO HELP US IN A IN A CHEAP OTHER PERMITS THAT ARE NEEDED AND FEDERAL LEVEL WE ARE. WE ARE FIVE MINUTES SO IF YOU COULD- WRAP UP IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER POINT MAKE A FINE BUT- BOB. SO JUST OF A FIFTH THAT THEY WANT TO HIRE IS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST OVER A- BILLION DOLLARS- AND BE ABLE TO RAISE THOSE FUNDS- WE'VE GOT- BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE ACRES AS WE GO ALONG. BEEN ABLE TO SET ASIDE THE ACRES. TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AS WE GO ALONG WITH OUR GIRLS GROWTH AS WELL- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS LATER IF I COULD PERHAPS CLOSE ON THE SLIDE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION OR- TO. THE AND HOW THEY FACTORED IN THE- AND THIS IS. A AND- OF SHOWING. IN CERTAIN CASES ARE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE COST COMPARED TO OTHER FEES THAT WE SEE APPLYING AS WELL TO ACOSTA DEVELOPMENT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS WHICH IS A WELL THANK YOU- IT THANK YOU. SURE WINNER CHAIRMAN WEAR AND TEAR AGO CARE CURRY FOR BEING HERE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU YOU ALL HAVE BEEN VERY BOLD AND I KNOW SOMETIMES I'M POPULAR WITH THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE ANY KIND OF DRESSES CRISIS. THE POP UP AS WELL JUDGE AT. PRESENTOTHER IDEAS OUT THERE THAT WERE. CHOI OUT- I'M FORTUNATE THAT WE DO HAVE A FULL COUNCIL- THAT'S FULL UNANIMOUS CITY COUNCIL THAT- UNDERSTANDS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. HAVE TO ADDRESS IS WE HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT WE CAN JUST KEEP DOING THE SAME. THING SO WE KNOW THAT THAT. IS AFFECTING OUR- ABILITY TO ADDRESS OUR HOME THE SITUATION ARE BECOMING DEVELOPMENT ATTRACTING BUSINESSES RETAINING. THIS IS IN OUR COMMUNITY- OUR WORK FORCE HOUSING EVERYTHING HINGES ON HOUSING- EVEN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE TABLE AND- REDUCING FEAR. AND ADDRESSES ISSUE WITH US HELLO. I JUST WANNA BE REAL COULD. FEES ARE ONE THING BUT IT'S A MULTITUDE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE DOING SO THE PAST YOU. AND A HALF. SO HIS. THE YOU WERE THERE MAP AND IS A LOT OF THESE. DESIGNER VIEWING PERMIT SO THOSE ARE IS MUST RIGHT IF YOU DOWN ON OR TRY TO PROMOTE MULTI HOUSING YOUR TRANSIT WEEVIL IN AND FEES FOR A WE I YOU KNOW WE'VE THAT THE- AS WIENER HAS. LAST YEAR I REDUCE BECAUSE YOUR HOUSE REQUIREMENTS THERE'S MORE USED TO BE BUILT RATHER THAN JUST A FEW THAT PAID TAKES UP ONE TIME GENERALLY HAPPENS YOU PUT. WOULD BE JUST AS PLANNED ADDRESS IT WOULD TAKE CARE THAT REQUIREMENTS THE VEHICLE MOUSE. LIMIT ALL REQUIREMENTS AND MEET OUR HIGH CAPS TO MOVE TO FOR. EACH IS MARKED THIRTY TO. THE TORQUE ON TAP. THIS FOR IN WOMAN REDUCE TAKE AN EIGHTEEN MONTHDOWN SIX MONTH WE DID A HUNDRED INTENSELY BONE ARE DOWN TO PUSH DILEMMA DOWNTOWN WE CREATED A RENEWAL OPPOSED JUST JP WITH THE K. TO TRY TO REVENUE OF AND MONEY TO OUR REGION THE BILL HOUSING I WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON TAX ENHANCING ENOUGH. DE WITH THE COUNTY TO TRY. PRINCIPLE GONNA REDUCE THESE ARE. THE DISH THROUGH ON TAX FINANCE ANOTHER IS. A AND THEN WE HAVE AN- ON THEN ULTIMATELY OUR FEET FEE SCHEDULE SO YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT FEES IMPACT FEES AND WHAT THEY DO AND I AGREE ONE. WHOLE HEARTEDLY ON MY WORK FOR CITIES OF FEES CRITICAL FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT- BUT THERE ARE TREAT WASTE REDRESSING I'M SO WHAT. DID PETER HURLS AT. FOOT PER UNIT WE LOOKED AT. CAPS WE WERE AT PHOEBE. WITH PAYMENT AND WE'VE WE CAME UP WITH A OF A POLICY TO. TRY AT ALL SO WHAT WE THREE HAVING A TABLE WE PUT THIS POLICY AFFECTS VIA UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL TO DO IT. A TYPICAL IMPACT FEVER HIGH IT DOES HE REALLY BUILT ON UNIT IN OUR DOWNTOWN IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR. AND IT'S BROKEN DOWN IN THIS WAY. SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE FEES AND SAID HOW CAN WE ADDRESS SOME HOW CAN WE DO A- ALL THE- THINGS YOU. ARE TO ME. TAKE A- REPROACH TO IT. WATER WASTEWATER. ARE PATIENTS TO THE- WITH US. WITH PROP TWO EIGHTEEN SO WHAT WE DO. IS EXCRETED PAIN PLAN. FOR YEAR PAYMENT. OR MOVE THAT PAYMENT OF THAT FEE TO SIX MONTHS ARE PERMANENT FINANCING. GET IT OUT OF THE APPLE. THE STAFF. TO TRY TO HELP THE COST OF THE CONSTRUCTION MOVE. MOVE THOSE FEES. TO WEAR MAKE SENSE WHEN THERE'S REVENUE. CREATED HOUSING OKAY. THE FIRE FOR A HOUSING THAT GOES AWAY IF WE RATHER SEE THOSE UNITS BE BUILT. AND YOUR FEET THIS CALL THE- MINUTE. THAT SINCE. AFTER JUST LET. ME KNOW TOP. THE BASICALLY THE- FACILITIES BE PARK IN FACT THE- AND SCHOOL DISTRICT FEES. IF YOU'RE DE. WE IF YOU. THREE STE. RECAPPING THE FEES OF THREE STORIES YOU PAY FULL FEES TO EVERY FOR YOU AT ABOVE THAT. IN THE FEE. THERE'S ACTUALLY EVERY FOR YOU AT AT THE DOLLAR PER UNIT DROPS. SO WE AS A CITY GET THE DENSITY OF ONE. WE ALSO GET THE BASE. FEES THAT I CAN AND SUPPORT THE PARKS THAT WE WANT TO SEE. IF WE NEED. IN CHANGING THE- LOOK AT PARKS NOT BUILDING A SOCCER FIELD WITH. PLAYGROUNDS BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE URBAN PARKS AND HOW DO WE BILL GATHERING SPOTS IN YOUR- FUNDING A DIFFERENT. WAY THAN WE HAVE PASSED. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR FEE STRUCTURE CURRENTLY THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS OUR STANDARD IMPACT FEES- SO TYPICAL FIFTY FOUR PARK THE FF. A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND AFFORDABLE IN FEES ABOUT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR SEVEN STORY NINETY SIX UNIT. PROJECT IN OUR DOWNTOWN. BUT WE DID IS. THE HEIGHT IS THE INCENTIVE- IN IN OUR DOWNTOWN BASS HE SAID. RECAPPING THE STORIES- CAPPING FEES AT THREE STORIES WERE STILL GENERATING A DISH SET BASELINE FEES THAT WE CAN PUT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO- DEFERRED THE SURFACE FOR SIX MONTHS. AND WE DID A COMIC HOUSES ON THAT SHOW THAT'S ABOUT SIX. DOLLARS A UNIT IN SUCH THIGS AND BY DIFFERING THOSE FEET. I'M FOR THE UPPER. TO THAT DROPS THE PRICE TO ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF IS IT WHICH WERE COLLECTING FOR TO TRY TO SUPPORT THIS- URBAN. ELEMENTS WHEN I LOOK AT. AND IF THIS THE FULLY MARGAERY PROP IF YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT. SIDE IF YOU DO OF ONE AYE. AFFORDABLE SIMPLE PLEASURE POLICY WE DROP THOSE USED MORE WITH. TO A PERSON FOOT APPROACH. A FOR THE REST OF THE IT WAS TRUE WHICH- WAS. ANY AND THAT'S- BY THIS ACCOUNT. HOW DO WE- THE TYPE PRODUCT WE WANT TO SEE OUR. TESTING IT OUT GET EVERYTHING WHICH WERE THROWN IT AT THAT THE WINDOW. SEE IF IT WORKS SEEING WHAT STATE. SEEN PEOPLE PICK UP ON AND THEN FINE TUNING AS NEEDED- AND THEN IT JUST A THE LAST THING I WANT TO SHOW I SHOULD THIS IN THE PAST. WE DID SO. MESSED WITH OUR EIGHTY YOU FEES I'M EARLY ON TWO YEARS AGO TO SEE HOW THAT WHAT MIGHT WORK. AND WE NEEDED TO EIGHTY USE BILL IN OUR COMMUNITY TO SEE A- IT'LL UNITS BUILT. ON THE SIX STATE LAW WHEN EFFECT JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SAW A LITTLE BUMP THERE THAT WE JUST READ WE- THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS. I'M SOME OF THOSE. WE HADN'T. BEEN MANY. CENTERS THE SQUARE FEET SEE WHAT WOULD HAVE. AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT WE HAD IT IN IMMEDIATE JOE IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF YOU THEY'RE COMING IN. CITY AND THE STATE IS CAN. TO WE START TO SEE THE DENNIS BE BUILT. ON BOTH. WE'VE WE- AS IN CITY. DIRECT A COULD CORRELATION TO HOW DO LOCAL AND WE SEE RESULT IS HOW WHICH IS THE KEY FOR A THIS I'M SO WE'LL BE DOING SAME THING CHIU ALL THOSE OTHER PA DO POLICIES TO THE ACT CITY ACTUALLY I AN EFFECT ON THIS HOUSING AND SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT WELL GONNA BE LOOKING FOR HOW DO WE HAVE SINCE FINISHED. FOR WE. DO YOU. BUY AND I DIDN'T. GOOD MORNING HONORABLE MEMBERS I'M TOM PACE INTERIM DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. I AM PLEASED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO YOU FROM THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE. BY WAY OF CONTEXT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT. AND THE IMPLICATIONS THESE DIFFERENCES HAVE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE HISTORICALLY SACRAMENTO HAD GROWN OUTWARD BY ADDING NEW SUBDIVISIONS ON GREENFIELD LANDS SUCH AS FORMER FARMLAND. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE CITY ADOPTED A NEW GENERAL PLAN THAT SAID A MAJOR OBJECTIVE TO GROW INWARD RATHER THAN OUTWARD. MAJOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AREAS WERE NOT ADDED TO THE PLAN. THIS MEANT THAT MOST NEW DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE ACCOMMODATED WITHIN THE EXISTING CITY LIMITS AND IN AREAS THAT HAD LONG BEEN PLANNED FOR DEVELOPMENT. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS SACRAMENTO HAS SEEN INCREASING INFILL DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE CENTRAL CITY. AND IN OTHER OLDER NEIGHBORHOODS. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE PROVIDING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN GREENFIELD AREAS IS STRAIGHT FORWARD. SINCE THERE IS LITTLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE DEVELOPER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY ALL IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER IN IN FILLED AREAS THERE IS USUALLY A MIXTURE OF VACANT LAND AND DEVELOP LAND WITH SOME EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THESE AREASTHE CITY AND DEVELOPERS MUST ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT NEW INFILL DEVELOPMENT. IN SOME CASES THIS THING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY DEFICIENT AND CANNOT SUPPORT NEW DEVELOPMENTS. IN OTHER CASES THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE EXCESS CAPACITY SO THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED WITH MINIMAL COST. TO SUPPORT OUR INFILL POLICY OBJECTIVES AND RECOGNIZING THAT INFILL DEVELOPMENT IS CHALLENGING SACRAMENTO HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS ABOUT INCREASING DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. BEFORE WE WERE AMEND ANY NEW FEES OR INCREASES TO EXISTING FEES WE ASSESS THE MARKET FEASIBILITY OF DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT TYPES WITH AND WITHOUT ANY PROPOSED FEE. WE ALSO REVIEW REGIONAL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER AGENCIES BEFORE SETTING FEES. TO SUPPORT OUR POLICY OBJECTIVES WE HAVE MADE THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS. WE EXEMPT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM CITY IMPACT FEES. WE ALLOW DEFERRAL OF PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES NORMALLY FEES HAVE TO BE PAID PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS UNDER FEET OF FOR ALL THE FEET DON'T HAVE TO BE PAID UNTIL COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT MEANS LESS UP FRONT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO GET A BUILDING PERMIT IT. WE INSTEAD OF A HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT WITH LOWER HOUSING IMPACT FEES. WE ALSO CHARGE LOWER FEES IN THE CENTRAL CITY. NEAR LIGHT RAIL STATIONS AND IN AREAS WITH WEAKER HOUSING MARKETS. WE EXEMPT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS FROM MANY IMPACT FEES REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE. WE REDUCED PARKLAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS AND THE RESULTING IN LIEU FEES IN THE CENTRAL CITY RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY MORE LAND HERE AND BUILD NEW PARKS IN THE CENTRAL CITY. WE ALL REDUCE OUR GRATIFICATION PRINCE IN THE REST OF THE BY 30% PARTICIPATE IN THE STATEWIDE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WHICH CAN FINANCE BOTH NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPACT FEES. WHICH ARE PAID OFF BY FUTURE PROPERTY OWNERS. THIS IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR ALTERNATIVE TO FORMING A MELD USED TO. PROTECT THE FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME DEVELOPMENT. WE CALCULATE MOST FEES ON A PER SQUARE FOOT BASIS RATHER THAN A PER UNIT BASIS WHICH REDUCES COSTS FOR SMALLER UNITS AND INCENTIVIZE IS MORE AFFORDABLE MICRO UNIT HOUSING. PROVIDE ATTACK THE ESTIMATE FOR PROJECTS DESTINED TO ELIMINATE SURPRISES AND ASSIST WITH DUE DILIGENCE WE PLACE ALL OF THE INFORMATION ON A SINGLE WEBSITE AND ORGANIZE THE FEES BY RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT TYPES. AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH NOT A FEE WE'VE ALSO ELIMINATED OR REDUCED PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROJECT TYPES THAT CAN BE APPROVED BY STAFF WITHOUT PUBLIC HEARINGS. WHICH ALSO LOWERS DEVELOP BUSTS. WITH THESE CHANGES IMPACT THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN INFILL DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO SEE CONSTRUCTION COSTS RISING WHICH MAKES MANY KINDS OF DEVELOPMENT IN FEASIBLE. WE ARE CHALLENGED TO FIND WAYS TO BACK FILL OUR GENEROUS FEE REDUCTIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE FEES WERE ESTABLISHED TO PAY FOR NECESSARY FACILITIES IN IT STRUCTURE. SO FEE REDUCTIONS ARE BIRDS REDUCE THE CITY'S ABILITIES TO FIND THEM. THE CITY DOESN'T COURAGE THE STATE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO INCREASE LOCAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO RAISE REVENUE TO PAY FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU ALL- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL OR COMMENTS SOME REMEMBER. HI GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND I JUST WHEN I COMMEND YOU ON THE STRATEGY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADOPTING THE PLAN IN YOUR CITIES IT'S EXCITING TO HEAR ABOUT SOLUTION AND- AN APPROACH THAT ALIGNS INCENTIVES TO THE OUTCOMES THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE STATE WHEN OUR CHIEF I'M SO I'VE GOT TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS A STATE POLICY MAKE YOURS WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN YOU STARTED TO GET SOME OF THAT BUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP FOR CITIES PLEASE LAST FALL. AND SECOND HOW CAN WE ALIGN INCENTIVES GET MORE CITY. TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'D LIKE. SUGGEST ONE THING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN HERE IN THE CAPITAL THE STATE. AND HERE IN THE CENTRAL CITY SURROUNDED BY FREEWAYS WHICH OUR STATE FACILITIES. I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO STOP ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO MITIGATE FOR TRAFFIC IMPACT STATE FREEWAYS WE READ. THE LETTERS FROM CALTRANS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS ADJACENT TO STAY FREEWAYS AND ASKING THAT THESE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS PAY. SOMETHING OR UNDER TWO STUDIES TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE IMPACT IS AND THEN WHICH IS COURSES. IN SOME CASES AND THEN THAT TAKES TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEN IMPOSE A FEE. CARD OR JUST ACTION ON THE DEVELOPER. TO FIX THE STATE'S FREEWAY SO IT'S A STATE FACILITY NOT A LOCAL FACILITY BE GREAT IF THE STATE WOULD FIX THE STATE FACILITIES AND NOT BURDEN LOCAL AREAS WITH THAT. AND IT WHEN IT. IS SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL FEES ARE LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE STATE- THE STATE COULD DETERMINE YOU KNOW OTHER WAYS TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF OUR EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE- VERY CLOSELY CONTROLLED BY THE STATE. I'LL JUST ADD THE- FUNDING I THINK CREATING A FLEXIBLE TACTIC MY FINANCING TOOLS AND THERE WAS SOME WORK DONE LAST YEAR TO MAKE THAT MORE ACHIEVABLE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY HELPFUL. I'M WITHIN ALL LOOK AT HOW THE FUNDING IS THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING PUT OUT THERE NOW FOR CITIES TO TRY TO DEVELOP THESE POLICIES THE CITIES THAT HAVE PUT THESE POLICIES FACTOR. SO SHE LEFT ON THE SIDELINES WAITING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TRY TO GET PROJECTS FORWARDED WE KNOW WE GET A COUPLE POP WHEN IT'LL START. THE SO. RIGHT AWAY CONSENT TO SAY IF THE IN SOME OF THE SAME HOW CAN WE BE MORE COMPETITIVE FOR SOME OF THE STATE FUNDS TO TRY TO GET SOME PRODUCT. ACTUALLY BILL. SOME AND I SEE IF I COULD JUST AS A QUICK FOLLOW UP FORGET SOME REQUIRE- ARE ARE YOU CURRENTLY RECEIVING THOSE LETTERS FROM CALTRANS. WE HAVE RECENTLY WITHIN THE PAST YEAR- SO I'M GONNA MAYBE THERE'S A CHANGES HAPPEN LAST FEW MONTHS BUT WE ARE WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME. OKAY YOU SEND ME COPIES OF ALL THOSE LETTERS CERTAINLY- I'M ACTUALLY HORRIFIED TO YOUR THE CALTRANS. IS CONTINUING TO DO THAT- I HAVE- HEARD AND ACTUALLY WAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. WHO INFORMED ME THAT BACK WHEN SHE WAS MAYOR OF GLENDALE THEY USED TO GET ALL OF THESE LETTERS FROM CALTRANS. OPPOSE INFILL DEVELOPMENT. TAX BASED. WE CHECKED ON THAT TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HAPPENING WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NO LONGER. HAPPENING AND- TWO EIGHT AN ACCURATE AND- BOBBI INTO IN GETTING THOSE LETTERS AND I IT IS BEYOND. PER CALTRANS TO START PROPOSING INFILL PROJECTS BECAUSE OF IMPACTS AND FREEWAYS WHEN THE WHOLE POINT OF INFILL PROJECTS. TO REDUCE TRAFFIC. IN ADDITION CALTRANS WAS SUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR IN KILLING LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED AND GETTING THE GOVERNOR VETO IT TO EXPAND PEDESTRIAN BIKE AND TRANSIT OPPORTUNITIES ON STATE OWNED ROADS WHICH MAKES CONGESTION WORSE- AND SO- I'M GOING TO LOOK INTO THIS AND IF WE NEED TO. PASS LEGISLATION TO BAN CAL ON FROM THERE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT I'M OPEN TO- SO IF YOU COULD SET UP THOSE I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANKS. SO REQUIRE THEN MEMBER. OF RECORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF WILL BE VERY QUICK. FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PRISONERS- ON- THE IN DEPTH FOCUS THAT YOU HAD. ON THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND- SPECIFICALLY TO CITY SANTA ROSA PRECIADO VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FIRES. AT THE ASSISTANCE A MAJOR REALLY IS BEEN IN THE TRENCHES WITH THE CITY COUNCIL ON AND GETTING THE SMART GROWTH THAT IS JUST PLEADED FOR THE FUTURE AND- I JUST WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HARD WORK- INYO WORK FOR FROM OVER- WHEN IT COMES DOUBLE HIT IN THE SET THAT ONE IN TOWN. IN MY OWN. ASK FOR EACH OF YOU IN. THAT DOWN ABOUT START CITIES AND ROSA TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW YOU'RE STILL EARLY- IN ON THIS FIVE YEAR BY THE PROJECT. IS IT WORKING- BECAUSE I. I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. AGAIN JUST BEING CANDID. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO PENCIL IN A PROJECT LIKE LABOR COSTS LABOR SHORTAGES RIGHT EXCEPT DRESS SO TELL US AT WHAT WHAT YOU SEEN EARLY THEMES- ON THAT IS ONE OF ONE OTHER QUESTION AND- OBVIOUSLY AT THE PANELISTS PLEASE. SURE AT SOME OF A QUICK- THAT THE THIS ISSUE I ATTENDED JOKE THAT WE WERE WE TRIED TO CALL THE DEVELOPERS BLUFF IS A WHAT WHAT REALLY IS THE ISSUE AND I THINK WE TRY TO ADDRESS EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP- ONE WAY THE OTHER TO THAT LIST- WE FIND THAT IT DOES COME DOWN.DEPEND THE BOTTOM LINE PENCILING IN THE MARGIN OF CHICAGO AND LABOR COST AND HOW THAT'S IT YOU KNOW THE CASA EXTRACTIONS ARE DISCOVERS. AND BECAUSE- BUT WE ARE IN THE RED TO YOU JUST DON'T DON'T MAKE SENSE- THEN THEN IT COMES TO- DOWN TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HOUSING OR DOWNTOWN WE'RE TRYING TO. CREATE THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT THAT OUR CITY DOESN'T HAVE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE BAY AREA WE NEED START ACTING LIKE TO. START TO BRING THAT TO SEE TOWARD DOWNTOWN- IT'S- SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS TO BE THE FIRST ONE OR TWO TO GO AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT FIRST PUSHED ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO NOW WE'RE- WE'RE LOOKING. MONEY TO WE'VE- REASON EVERY NOW. ON A PRICE DISTRICT IN. PLACE TO TRY TO. ACT MONEY TO REGION. TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING BILL. YOU TO PLEASE. IF I MAY. AT TO THAT'S FOR THE COUNTY IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT- OBVIOUSLY OUR- URBAN CENTERS AND MORE IN THE CITIES BUT- WE ARE PLANNING AHEAD AND WE ARE LOOKING AT AREAS THAT WILL. ORGANIZE OVER TIME AND RIVER SEXUALITY. AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND- AND I AND I. REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE RENO TARGETS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISCUSSION FOR ALL OF YOU TO CONSIDER. FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A- TARGET OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND UNITS. I THINK WE'RE SECOND HIGHEST. IN THIS GUIDE REGION TO THE- LOS. ANGELES AND- I MORE. THAN OUR OTHER COUNTY. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO ACTUALLY. GONE OUT OF HIM EMPOWER. GOALS WE'VE- WE'VE- THE LAND. PROVIDED THAT. HIRED THE HOUSE. SO THE ZONING IS NOT. THE ISSUE SO MUCH AS THE CALL. BRING TO. AREAS OF THE- I WOULD OFFER AS ARE WE ACTUALLY MOVED NEEDLE SEE THE HOUSING BUILT AS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ALIGN ST FUNDING PRIORITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES WITH RENO TARGETS SO THAT THE AGENCIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE GROWTH HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THAT. IN ADDITION TO IN JUST KLAY AT GERMANY AT THIRTY SECONDS OR LESS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LST PANEL. STRATEGY TO BE AT THE BACK FILL. FACILITIES THAT MAY HAVE TO BE DEFERRED. BASED OFF OF EITHER DEFERRALS OR CAP ANY FEES AT THIRTY SECONDS OR LESS FROM EACH YEAR. SO I MENTION ONE BE CENTRALLY LOWERED OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE KIND OF FACILITIES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE. SO THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY WATER SEWER DRAINAGE FLOOD CONTROL. AND THERE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NICE TO HAVE AND ARGUABLY IMPORTANT FOR A COMMUNITY BUT NOT ESSENTIAL TO OCCUPY A DWELLING UNIT SO I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AB I MEAN IT WE COULD SEE A DIMINUTION IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE BUT- IT MAY BE A METHOD IT'S RIGHT NOW WITHOUT ANY OTHER FUNDING SOURCE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OF. OPTIONS WE HAVE THANK YOU. I'D SAY- YOUR TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE POINT EARLIER IS GOOD AND ONE ON THE TABLE ALL DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE TABLE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS TOGETHER- AND IT RETHINKING WHAT PARKS ARE THINK IT RETHINKING HOW WE- LOOK AT OUR- WATER SEWER SERVICE- INTO WHAT KIND OF FUNNY DO WE NEED BECAUSE TYPICALLY. IN OUR SITUATION WHERE WE WERE A SUBURBAN MODEL AND SO THAT'S A REMODEL CARRIES FORWARD AND TRIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN AN URBAN SETTING. THAT DOESN'T QUITE MATCH UP SO READ. IS CRITICAL- AND THEN NEXUS FEES TEN TENNIS SO YOU ALWAYS NEED. A LOT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. HE'S ONLY BE CHARGED SO MUCH TO MAKE PROJECT WORK IN EVERY CITY HAS TO REDUCE THOSE FEES TO. TO MAKE THAT WORK SO. IT'S TRYING TO FIND OTHER SOURCES TO FILL THIS GAP AND NOT BEING STUCK ON THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT THOSE SERVICES WE JUST HAVE TO FIND ADDITIONAL- WASTE. THEIR AND RETHINK HOW. BY THE SERVICE. THANK YOU. SOME OF RECORD. I'M I WANTED TO JUST COME IN THE RIVER SAID IT WAS INTERESTED BECAUSE OF REGIONALIZATION- I'VE REPRESENTATIVE TOTALLY RURAL AREA AND I JUST SEE- A LOT OF- CHALLENGES TO TRY TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK WITH WITHOUT HAVING IMPACT FEES- HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT IT IN SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS TO- ADDRESS PUBLIC OUTREACH TO USE THAT MAYBE SOME OF YOUR THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE AREA AT. LET'S GOING THE REGION OF VIEW RATHER JUST CITY BY CITY. MY YOU RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S REALLY PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS AS WE'RE OUT THERE HAVING THOSE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ON A GROWTH IN IMPACTS AND THERE ARE CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY FROM OUR COMMUNITIES. GOES A LONG WAY TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT THE FOLKS- COMING IN TO OCCUPY THESE NEW HOMES ARE ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND THEY'RE PAYING A VERY SIGNIFICANT. FEE THAT DOES GO DIRECTLY TO FUND THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACTS. SO IT IT CREATES A GREATER ACCEPTABILITY AND MY MOM AND WITH OUR EXISTING ENTITIES AS YOU'RE DOING THAT- WE ALSO HAVE INTERCONNECTED OUR OUR FEES AND SPECIAL REGIONAL PHASE WITH OUR OUR CELL TAX PROGRAMS AND WITH A RIBBON SPACE PROGRAMS AND- ALSO. THE CONNECTIVITY AFTER. THAT ALL WORK OTHER. TO PROVIDE REVENUE GROWTH. PROVIDES FOR A HIKE OF MOVIE. AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY- WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT STORE NOW OFF TO THE FOURTH AND FINAL PANEL AFTER GETTING THROUGH AN OVERVIEW OF LOCAL FISCAL CONSTRAINTS DISCUSSION OF HOW IMPACT FEES ARE SPENT AND LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES AND INNOVATIONS AROUND. GOVERNMENT IMPACT FEES OUR FINAL PANEL WILL LOOK AT- HOW IMPACT FEES AFFECT. DEVELOPMENT AND ARE BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND BUILDERS FOLLOWING THE MONEY- WANT TO INVITE UP FRONT TO HOMES- IT CEO DAVID SAMSON JAMBOREE- IT'S VICE PRESIDENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JERRY GLASSER AND FROM THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION POLICY DIRECTOR DAVID GARCIA THE TURNER CENTER- RECENTLY IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. PUT OUT- REPORT RESIDENTIAL IMPACT FEES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS CALLED FOR- BY MR GRAYSON'S BILL. COUPLE YEARS AGO OF WITHOUT ONE WE START WITH MR CHANCE. IT SOUND HEARING THANK YOU LESS MEMBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S SAN WITH THE OVER HOMES I THE PROOF OF ALL BEING CHAIRMAN FOR CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THIS YEAR SO WE'RE WEARING MANY HATS- OUR FIRM- HAS BEEN INVOLVED THAT FOR MANY YEARS MORE OR MULTI GENERATIONAL SINGLE FAMILY BY FAMILY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION COME. THAT WE ALSO BUILD TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND- NOW MOVING INTO THE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ASPECTS OF CULTURAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE NEXT STEP UP FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO- COVER A FULL GAMUT WE ALSO HAVE ON OUR PANEL HERE IN MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. AND OUR INDUSTRY REPRESENTS ABOUT 85% OF. ALL RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA TODAY SO WHETHER IT BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKET RATE HOUSING. YOU NAME IT WE BUILD IT SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY TO HELP- DISCUSS SOME SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUE WERE WILLING TO BE AT THE TABLE AND CONTINUE ON. WITH THIS PROCESS FOR WHATEVER IT TAKES- IN TRYING TO DO THIS IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I FELT IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE BUILD OFF OF SOME PRESENTATION THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO OTHER COMMITTEE- FINANCE. GROUPS AS IT RELATES TO JUST HOUSING IN GENERAL WHY ARE WE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH ADDS TO OUR HOMELESS CRISIS ON AFFORDABILITY ISSUES SO WERE FOUND MONEY AND HOW DEVELOPMENT IS THE FACT. IMPACT OUR BUILDING- IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDED NEXT TIME I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A POWER POINT. HOPEFULLY ALL GOTTEN- THE HANDOUT HAT WE JUST PUT ON THE DíAS. VIEW OF HOW BUILDING WORKS SO THERE'S BASICALLY CAN LINE ITEMS AT EVERY DEVELOPER WITH YOUR AFFORDABLE OR MARKET RATE WERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE LOOK AT ITS REVENUE AND BOTTOM LINE WE HAVE TO HAVE A BOTTOM LINE TO MAKE PROJECT DEVELOPED INTO SOME OF THE PRESENTERS SAID EARLIER TODAY THE REVENUE REALLY IS SET BY THE MARKET PLACE WE CAN'T JUST ADD COST TO HOUSING AND THEN INCREASE THE PRICE NECESSARILY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO PUSH THE LIMITS. BUT THAT'S HOW IT WORKS SO WELL IN THOSE FACTORS YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT INFLUENCE HOUSING FEES ARE A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THAT AS WE GET INTO AN FORMA AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S VERY. THERE'S ALSO OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU DEAL WITH IT WHETHER IT BE PROP THIRTEEN- SEQUEL- ALL KINDS OF INCLUSIONARY ZONING OTHER ISSUES THAT RELATE TO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN BUILD. UP A PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO PENCIL OR NOT AS YOU'VE HEARD. SO IN YOUR PACKET YOU'LL FIND AN EXAMPLE OF AN INFILL MIX DENSER ELEMENT AYE CHIPS OUT ONE FOR THE PERFORMER BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN IN A SHORT ORDER TIME. IN THE BACK YOUR PACKET THERE'S THREE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WE TOOK A COASTAL PROJECT WE TOOK. AN INFILL A GREEN FIELD AND A HIGH DENSITY PROJECT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND IF YOU. VENTURE INTO LOOKING AT THOSE NUMBERS YOU'LL SEE. THAT THE VARIABLES THAT ARE RELATIVELY FIXED AS YOU'VE HEARD. ARE THINGS LIKE CONSTRUCTION COSTS. AND ALL THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE ACTUAL BUILDING OF THE HOUSING UNIT. THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO VARIABLES- THAT HAVE SOME MOVEMENT AT ALL THAT'S WHAT THE WHAT WE'RE HERE IS DO TODAY WHICH IS FEET. THE OTHER ONE PLAN. AND WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE EXAM. THE CALL US. X. THE RIVER NEW. THE PROJECT. AND THERE'S NO WAY OUT. OKAY AND MANY OF THE DEVELOPER THAT. CURRENTLY HAVE INVENTORY AND CAL ARE GETTING. BECAUSE THAT. OBJECT ORDERED BUT WITH THE EXACTION ACOSTA WITH THAT GO INTO IT. SO YOU TURN THE PAGE UNDER THE NUMBER FOR WHICH IS THE IN MAKES DENSITY HOUSING. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROJECT THAT WE PRESENTED TO YEARS AGO I WAS JUST GETTING STARTED THERE'S A PICTURE IN YOUR PACKET IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FORTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE UNITS. INFILL DEVELOPMENT- IN LIVERMORE CALIFORNIA AND IT GIVES YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THAT PENCILS AND OUR WORKED. AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE TOP LINE YOUR LAND YOUR ENTITLEMENT COST YOUR SITE IMPROVEMENTS. THOSE THOSE ARE ALL RELATIVELY BAKED INTO THE PROCESS THE PERMIT FEES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WERE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO YEARS AGO AND ABOUT TWELVE AND AFTER. OF PROJECT. AND THAT. CONSTRUCTION BOSS HEARD IS NOT REALLY VERY ABLE SINGS WE CAN DO TO TWEAK AND MODEL. THINGS BUT FOR THE MOST PART EVERY ONE OF THESE LINE ITEMS WE ARE ATTACKING THE AS A DEVELOPER- WITHIN THE BUILDING COMMUNITY TO TRY TO MAKE A PROJECT WORK OR NOT- SELLING BECAUSE FINANCING COSTS ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS. THAT HAVE TO FIT IN SO THAT I KNOW THE DAY THERE'S- NO. BUILDING THE CHECK TO PROD THE PROP BIG MAY SENSE FROM A FOR WHEEL HOW TO. THAT THEY CAN GET ENOUGH FUNDING TO BUILD. IF THERE IS NONE OF THAT THE PROJECT DOESN'T GO FORWARD. SO IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE. YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS IS BEEN A PROCESS OF YEARS IN THE MAKING WE'VE WE'VE SPENT WITH TALKED ABOUT PROP THIRTEEN SEQUEL ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE IN THE LATE SEVENTIES IT CAME INTO EFFECT WHICH WERE GREAT TO HELP PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT ARE NOW COMING TO ROOST FORTY YEARS LATER WE'RE DEALING WITH A CRISIS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX ON A FAIRLY SHORT WORK ORDER- PROBABLY GONNA TAKE SOME PRETTY BOLD MOVES ON YOUR PART I DON'T. I DON'T REALLY RELISH SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU'LL MAKE THE BIG BUCKS TO- SET UP SAID YEAH AND THE LEGISLATURE IN. AND TRY TO MAKE THESE OF CRITICAL DECISIONS FOR US ALL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RISE IN FEES ON THE NEXT PAGE. YOU'LL SEE WE GAVE YOU A SMATTERING OF ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN PROJECTS- FROM ANY ACTOR TRACY. AND THE FEES RANGE AROUND 10218% ON ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WE CURRENTLY WORK ON. I PUT LIVER MORE IN THERE AS WELL BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE THESE ARE CURRENT TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY FEES IN THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE YOU ON THE PRECEDING PAGE WAS TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THOSE FEET HAVE GONE UP FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR 40% IN TWO YEARS IN LIVERMORE ALONE. AND WHAT THAT DOES. IS IT THE ROADS THE DEVELOP ABILITY OF THAT PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE REVENUES OF ACTUALLY GONE DOWN AS YOU CAN SEE THEIR AVERAGE REVENUE TODAY IS SEVEN NINETY. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS EIGHT HUNDRED. SO THE REVENUES WENT DOWN THERE FEES WENT UP. THEIR STOCK IS AS YOU HEARD FROM SO THE OTHER PRESENTERS THAT DEVELOPER- THEY HAD TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE OUR COSTS WENT UP THEY WERE ALREADY. GOING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT. AND COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN. SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED. TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON TOGETHER AND ADDRESS. AND I WILL TURN OVER THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME. THE VOTER WHO IS OUR CHAIR ONE FROM THE I A- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME CRASH RELIGIOUS SESSION HAVEN'T ON DO THAT BUT DAVE ASK ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ONE SLIDE TO YOU. AND IT'S ACTUALLY THE NEXT PAGE AND IT'S AND THE LITIGATING TO CONTROL FEES. IN MY CAPACITY IS THE CHAIR FOR BE A BAY AREA I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD TO FILE SUIT. IN ORDER TO ENFORCE CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ON FEES AND THAT IS AN ADDED PROJECT COST NOT ONLY ARE WE PAYING INCREASED USE BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO AFTER THAT IN A LAWSUIT. THE US MONEY TO AND- RECENTLY WE HAD. A HOST. I'M ACTUALLY A NINE FOR THE FEW WHO HAVE SOME BACKGROUND THE NINE NINE EIGHT WAS. ASSIGNED IN ENTERED YESTERDAY'S NO PROBLEM TELL. THEY HAVE A HUGE CLOUDS MEANT THE- OUR FATE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO. TELL TO GET FEES. BUT FOR THOSE EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN PAYING INCREASED PERMIT% FEES AT A RATE OF ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR. AT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR TIMES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMES HAVE BEEN BUILT OVER THE EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD WE'RE LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED- AND THAT TRANSLATES DIRECTLY TO THE COST OF HOUSING- FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCREASED HOUSING COST. WE LOSE EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY HOUSEHOLDS WHO CAN BUY A HOME. AND ANY H. B. PUTS OUT A STUDY EVERY YEAR- THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS. AND IT TALKS ABOUT OUT PRICING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRICED OUT OF HOMES. SO IT HOLLISTER THIS YEAR WE ACTUALLY HAVING TO SUIT. WELL WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. WE ARE UNLIKELY TO EVER RECOVER THOSE TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS WE'RE SEEING THIS MORE AND MORE AND WE'RE HAVING TO USE IT AS A TOOL LITIGATION IS NOW OUR TOOL. TO TRY AND ENFORCE EXISTING PROCEED OR SO I'VE GONE AHEAD AND GIVEN YOU THE CASE INFORMATION THERE I HAVE THE ANY H. B. STUDIES THAT. ABOUT PRICING THAT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY HAVE. MAY NEED. ABOUT HOW. GEN THAT IN ORDER TO REINFORCE EXISTING FORMULA THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE TO NEXT BAKER ARE FROM GYMBOREE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY COMMENTS TODAY MY NAME IS JURY GLASSER HEDRICK I FROM JAMBOREE HOUSING CORPORATION AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THEIR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS. JAMBOREE BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER THAT'S BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS WE OVERSEE NINETY THREE PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE NINE THOUSAND UNITS IN SERVICE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ARE FULLY- SPANS AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND AS FAR NORTH AS SACRAMENTO AND YOLO COUNTY- JAMBOREE AND ITS STAFF AS WELL STEVE IT SEASON AT GATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING AND ALSO WELL VERSED ON HOW DIFFERENT COST. ERRORS OF FACT FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY. IT TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT TODAY WITH REGARD TO THE INTERSECTION OF IMPACT FEES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FIRST IRATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WE PUT TOGETHER A CASE STUDY WHICH IS BEFORE YOU WHEN IS DISPLAYED ON OKAY. WHAT WE DID. FOR AFFORDABLE. JACK OUR EITHER COMPLETE OR IN THE PROCESS OF RECEIVING FUNDING TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPACT FEES AND TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST- I WILL NOTE THAT- THREE OF THE PROJECTS ARE NEW CONSTRUCTION WHICH INCLUDES THE FIRST PROJECT WHICH TO MANCHESTER AND IT'S LOCATED IN ANAHEIM. GATEWAY WHICH IS IN SACRAMENTO JUST ACROSS THE- TOWER BRIDGE AND SUNRISE POINT WHICH IS OUT IN CITRUS HEIGHTS WHICH IS THAT I NORTHERN INCORPORATED IN THE COUNT SACRAMENTO I ALSO INCLUDED- A PROJECT CALLED THE AKON A LARGE WHICH IS DOWN IN ANAHEIM IT'S AN ADAPTER USE PROJECT AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OUT YOU KNOW KIND INTERESTING TO TAKE. OUT AS A FORT AND. THE FATE. THING WE- EXPENSIVE PRICES THEY'VE TURNED TO. UNDER UTILIZED PIECES OF PROPERTY TO TRANSFORM THEM INTO HOUSING AND YET THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPACT FEES AS WELL- AS NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE. AND DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT- IMPACT THE FEE STRUCTURE BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING STOCK TO TAKE A LOOK AT. GIVEN THAT I AM FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I HAD SOME PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF HOW WHO WOULD HAVE HIGHER IMPACT FEES AND I WAS SURPRISED- TO DISCOVER THAT REALLY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND THAT PROJECT AND STRESSED HEIGHTS HAS THE HIGHEST BE LOAD PROXIMALLY TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT- AND EAT WHICH IS LESS THAN THE ORANGE COUNTY ANAHEIM EXAMPLE I WILL NOTE THAT THE ADAPTIVE RE USE THAN IT HAD IT'S A PERMANENT SO HOUSE JACK AND DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME ACT ON RULES THAT LIKE. MY PROJECT HOW. BUT MOST. FULL AND HER OUT IMPACT FEES ARE PER YOU. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE TOW PER. OF IMPACT FEES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE PERCENT- AND I YOU KNOW I THINK YOU HEARD DAVE'S- COMMENTS HE WAS TALKING MOSTLY ABOUT THE BAY AREA OF HIGHER FEE STRUCTURES I THINK WHAT YOU'LL FIND- IS THAT FEE STRUCTURE. VERY DIFFERENT AND ARE VERY JURIST SPECIFIC YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT WHAT A JURISDICTION VAL WAS AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN FUNDING BY THEIR FEE STRUCTURE. AND AGAIN IT'S REALLY RENTS AND IT'S AN IN ON WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF UNIT. THESE PROJECTS ALSO ARE ALL INFILL PROJECTS THEY ARE NOT GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT SO THAT ALSO HAS ITS IMPACT THE TOTAL FEE STRUCTURE. ALL IMPACT IS DON'T ACCOUNT FOR MUCH. OF THE- TOTAL PROJECT. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS- IMPACT FEES AND LAND COSTS ARE ONE OF THE TWO OF THE FACTORS THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER. CONSTRUCTION COSTS- THEY DON'T AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE THROUGH LEGISLATION AND LOCAL JURISTS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGH INNOVATION. CAN FACILITATE OUR REDUCE FATE FEES WAIVED FEES THE FIRST FOR DEFERRED FEES IT REALLY DOES HELP AFFORDABLE HAPPENING AND THERE AFFORDABILITY. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THERE IN A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN MARKET RATE PROJECT. BECAUSE THE RENTS ARE. THEY REALLY CAN'T LEVERAGE MORE DEBT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON FEDERAL TAX CREDITS FOR THEIR EQUITY PORTION. EIGHT ONE HOW BILLION LEVERAGE ANY PRETTY AND I WILL KNOW AS I'M SURE OF YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN BY BOTH THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING. ONLY NOT ONLY IMPACTS FINANCE FEASIBILITY BUT THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE MORE UNITS WHICH I KNOW IT. GOVERNOR'S A SEVEN REALLY I. JACK GIVE THAT THE SHORE THAT WE- RIGHT NOW. BUT WITH ALL THE SAYS I'M JIM READ ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IMPACT BEAT PLAY ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEPENDS ON IMPACT FEES I HAVE A COUPLE OF IDEAS- THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. HELP SPUR HELPING AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL LEVY A SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE QUINCES OF THE EXISTING PEACE ACTORS ONE- IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN ARTICULATED TODAY AND IT'S THE CONCEPT THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. REALLY NEED TO START LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE TO TRACK INCENTIVIZE. DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT TO THE CENTURY STATE IS ONE GET A LOT. OR WHAT TO DEVELOP YOU KNOW UNDER UTILIZED MOTELS ARE REALLY TO DEVELOP EIGHTY YOU UNITS ARE WANT TO DEVELOP MIXED IN DEVELOPMENTS THERE NEED TO WRITE. BACK THE STRUCTURE. THIS CONCEPT IT'S MORE OF A BROAD BUT WE'VE HER A LOT TO THAT YOU KNOW THE NEXUS STUDIES THAT ARE DONE TO ESTABLISH FEES ARE HAVE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BASED ON YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DATA THAT EXISTED- YEARS AGO AND I THINK ALL REALIZE THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH U. S. TO HOUSE- THE RIGHT BUTTONS THAT YEAH THAT RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS A RESULT AND PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING UNDER. I'M SAYS THERE ARE ON THE RIVER BEDS AND THE HOMELESS CRISIS IS JUST INCREASING GETTING WORSE AND SO I THINK THE CONCEPT IS TO RE THINK THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DEVELOP STRUCTURE TO THE X. WHAT A PORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING. IS TRYING TO HELP HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. STE INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY. ON UNDER IT YEAH SAME CAN THAT YOU STICK WITH NEW CAN YOU THE SAME AS IT IS AT THE SAME TODAY AS IT USED TO BE SHOULD HOMELESS PROJECTS REALLY BE GETTING A CREDIT VERSUS BEING CHARGED FOR THE STRAIN THAT THEY'RE PUTTING ON INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS THE KIND OF OUTER IDEA TO THINK ABOUT THE LAST IDEA AND I THINK I DON'T HAVE- EXPERIENCE WORKING IN ALL JURISDICTION MY IN JURISDICTIONS MY INCLINATION IS. MOST RESEARCH TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST TO BALANCE BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND TO PRODUCE HOUSING I THINK THEY'RE LIKELY ARE OUT LIARS THAT ARE TRYING TO EITHER DEVELOPMENT OR ARE TRYING TO PLAY I FEET. DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER COSTS THAT IN A- SO SEATED WITH THE TO. THE AFFORD HOUSING SITES ONE IDEA MIGHT BE- FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT IMPACT FEES AND TO CREATE YOU KNOW PROBLEM EITHER REGIONAL OR PROJECT TYPE CEILINGS FOR IMPACT FEES AND GIVEN THAT MOST- AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE TO MAKE A STOP AT THE STATE TO RECEIVE STATE RESOURCES. AT CONDITION OF THIS SOURCES POTENTIAL IN THESE- IMPACT FEE THE CEILINGS THAT ARE CREATED CAN BE A CRITERIA FOR RECEDING FEET SO IT INCENTIVIZE IS JURISDICTIONS OR BELOW THE CEILINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACT AS TO STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT IT COURAGE'S STIRS AND- CAN I GET. CENTER BILL WILL HAVE. REGISTER IS TO BETTER OVER FRESH TO ACTUALLY LOWER THEIR SO THAT THE ACCESS THE RESEARCH. AM I APPRECIATE THEM TODAY AND THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANKS THANK YOU EN ARE SPEAKER MISTER PERCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA I AM POLICY DIRECTOR HAD PETERSON OF HOUSING DIVISION. AT UC BERKELEY APPRECIATE THE- THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT A TOPIC THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'VE ISSUED. A HANDFUL REPORTS ON THIS EXACT TOPIC- THE LATEST OF WHICH WAS IN HIS LAST SUMMER TWENTY NINETEEN- WHICH WAS DONE AT THE BEHEST OF THE STATE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SO. I'M GONNA TALK. ARE THINGS FROM THIS RESEARCH ARM AND ALSO SOME OF OUR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS WORK AS WELL- ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER PIECE SEARCH. ON HOW THE COUPLE WEEKS THAT WILL TAKE THE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE AT THIS POINT- EVEN A STEP FURTHER STILL. FOR THAT. THE BIG. THAT BEEN. I THINK A LOT FOLKS TAKE WHEN THEY LOOK. THAT IN SOME. NOW ALSO DUE TO IN SOME CITY HE'S GONNA UP BECAUSE HIGH IN FACT IN OUR PORT WE FOUND THAT. IS SINCE IS. ON HE PERSON. READY PROJECT EXPERIENCES UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU. SOMETIMES UNDER. DOLLARS UNIT. WE KNOW DEVIOUS. LITERATURE THAT. FEES OFTEN TIME DO YOU. ARE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER IN THE FORM OF HIGHER. RENTS OR HIGHER HOME PRICES AND I THINK THEY THEY THERE IS A COMMON EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW IF HE IS OR NOT. INTO PLAYING THE TOP. AT THE PRESERVING. I NOTE NOT. OF THE SAME AND IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN EIGHTY OR YOU BUILDING THIS MIDDLE HOW THE BILL NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH FOR. TO ABSORB AND IT DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AS YOU GO FURTHER DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT SCALE SO SMALL UNITS ISIS THINGS LIKE THAT- ALSO JUST A TOTAL NUMBER. HE'S A WEEK. ALSO FOUND SIGNIFICAN ISSUES TRANSPARENCY SO IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FEE SCHEDULES IN MANY INSTANCES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE FEW SCHEDULE SAY AND HOW THAT RELATES. TO YOUR PROJECT AND SO AGAIN. IS A BIGGER ISSUE FOR SMALLER BUILDERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OR TIME TO DIG THROUGH ITS CITY WEBSITE TO FIND FEE SCHEDULE AND UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE PROJECT THAT THEY LIKE TO. AND ONE OF THE LAST MAJOR FIND. THAT WE HAD WAS THAT MOST CITIES ARE NOT CONDUCTING REALLY ROBUST FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THEIR FEES WILL BE ON. THE ABILITY OF THE MARKET TO DELIVER HOUSING SO- MANY CITIES ARE RELYING ON AN INFORMAL COMMITTEES OR AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ARE CHARGING AS JUSTIFICATION FOR SITTING THERE FEES. NEITHER OF THESE ARE A BUS ENOUGH TO TAKE THE PLACE OF AN ACTUAL FULL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS TO REALLY. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE BEES THAT THEY NEED BUT ALSO NOT STOPPING. AND SO. SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND- INS FROM RESEARCH JUDGES TO QUICKLY SUMMARIZE THEM I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT TOLL FREE NUMBER- I THINK IT'S BEEN STATED A FEW TIMES HERE THIS MORNING THAT. YOU KNOW THE IT'S REALLY- OUT LIAR THOSE HIGHER FEES- SO TO THAT EXTENT THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. MEASURES TO CURTAIL SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES WHETHER THAT'S LOOKING AT- ACTUAL LANGUAGE IN THE MEDICATION FEE ACT OR REQUIRING SOME SORT OF FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS- THATWOULD KICK IN AFTER A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEES ARE ARE HIGHER THAN. THAN AVERAGE RENTER AVERAGE HOME PRICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT SUCH TOTAL FEEL. IMPORT OTHER LIST BEFORE FROM A HANDFUL OF CITIES THAT HAVE DONE SOME REALLY I THINK INNOVATIVE. THINGS TO REFORM THE WAY THE AMP FEES THERE IS OFTEN FEET PEARL. CHANGE WHAT TO SAY. AS FAR AND- SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS TO DEVELOPERS CO WITH THAT BECAUSE REALLY SPREAD IT OUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO ARE IDEA I THINK WE SHOULD BE EXT AS WELL ON IN IN THE ONE LAST A TO IT'S BEEN MADE A FEW TO A THAT THESE THESE ARE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CITIES ANY CASE RIGHT THERE BANG FOR. THINGS THAT WE ALL IN AND WE WILL SEE PARKS BERRIES ARE FIRE SAFETY. THINGS OF THIS NATURE. AND CITIES ARE REALLY CONSTRAINED IN THE WAY THAT THEY CAN RAISE REVENUE RIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF. A LARGELY BECAUSE OF OUR PROPERTY TAX STRUCTURE AND SO AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE DISCUSSING. THE NEED TO REFORM THE WAY CITIES. CALCULATES AND IMPOSE FEES WE SHOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSING WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN- PROVIDE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. UPGRADE AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY IS TO THE LEVELS OF. THAT THE WE ASPIRE. TO BE SUB. I'M GONNA STOP. AND THANK. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION. YOU OF YOUR TEST. LET ME UP. THERE ARE LIKE SO ONE ASK WHAT. ANYONE ANYONE IF NOT I WILL- I WILL JUMP IN SO THERE IS SOME SENSE WITH CITIES THAT HAVE HIGHER FEES- THAT THESE ARE CITIES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BUILD SO THEY'RE FINE WITH THE FEES HIRAM CURIOUS FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES- GIVE A SENSE WITH REGARD TO THE CITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST FEES IS IT BECAUSE- YOU ARE HAPPY FOR THERE NOT TO BE HOUSING OR DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE THAT THEY'RE JUST. TO BACK THAT THE M. THE IN FEES. I'M IT'S HARD TO SAY- I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IT IT MAY BE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ON WHAT THE FEE SHOULD BE. RIGHT AND THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THERE'S NO FEASIBILITY STAND CITIES HAPPEN PLOY TO SET THEIR FEES AT A LEVEL THAT THEY KNOW WILL NOT HINDER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND SO THEY MAY HEAR THAT. A COMMUNITY NEXT DOOR HAS SYMBOL THE HIGH FEES AND SAY WELL IF THEY CAN HANDLE IT AND YOU KNOW ARM CAN HANDLE TO. ANSWER THIS IS A BET THIS IS TURNING FEE SHOULD BE AND- I. BUT THINK THE OUR INTENTION HOLD ON SOME OF THE TIME BUT A IT'S REALLY HARD FOR SEIZE MAKE THESE DECISIONS WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO REALLY- FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT RATE IS RIGHT WITH THE RIGHT TO THEIR FEES AT THAT THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION YOU. TO ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF THE IMPACT OF THEIR FEES IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CITIES CURRENTLY DO CURIOUS HOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT STRUCTURING THAT PERCEPTION OF WEST SO. IDEA THERE WOULD BE TOOLS AVAILABLE THE SYSTEM THE TURNER CENTER HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT TRYING TO DEVELOP MORE MORE BROUGH BUS VERSION OF. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IN IN REAL TIME AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXISTING WORKING CONDITIONS ANOTHER. HOW DIFFERENT LEVELS WOULD IMPACT FEASIBILITY DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO IF WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE TO RESOURCE TO CITIES SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO. GET A- WHAT IS. YOU KNOW MONTHS TO. THIS ON THAT MAY NOT BE A TO DATE PUBLISHED I THAT WOULD GO LONG WAYS TOWARDS PARTICULARLY SMALLER AND MID SIZE CITIES HAVE THIS KIND OF INFORMATION- BUT THE FEELING THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF- TRIGGER IF THERE IS A THAT THAT THE FEES EXCEED A CERTAIN PERCENT. I'M SERVE IN A TWO. ACOSTA THAT THEN YOU'LL TO THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OF THIS TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT. SEC ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OH FIVE DID FOR INCLUSIONARY ZONING POLICIES RIGHT SO IF IT GOES ABOVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE MARKET COULD. SUSTAIN THAT HIGH OF A FEW THROUGH MARKET STUDY. AND ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR MISTER. TURNER I KNOW YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS- THAT YOU MAY OR OTHERS MAY WANT TO BUILD- REQUIRING THE SAME LEVEL OF IMPACT FEES FOR THEM IS- COULD BE SELF DEFEATING WE'RE TRYING TO ASK COMMUNITIES. TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THESE ARE UNITS THAT ARE NOT ACCRUING PROFIT TO DEVELOPERS AND YET WE'RE SETTLEMENT WITH THE EXACT SAME FEES. CURIOUS IF WE WERE TO REDUCE IT THESE ARE A LIMITED IMPACT FEES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HOW WILL IT CHANGE THE CALCULUS OF WHETHER YOU. DEVELOP MORE. FOR WHAT. IT'S YEAH THE IT'S A GREAT. ON A INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AT REDUCTION OF ANY COST- RESULTS IN NEEDING TO ASK FOR A LOT LESS TAX CREDITS LESS BONDS LESS LOCAL SUBSIDY SO- ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING IS SPREADING THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OVER POTENTIALLY MORE UNITS- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DESIRE OF THE STATE AND BUT I'M LOCAL DURING. I JUST SAY IT WAS TEXT. ALL THE- AND JUST THE CHANGE IN THEIR ABOUT HOUSING AND NEEDING TO SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENCY IN THE HOMELESS PROBLEM HAS HAS REALLY I THINK CHANGE THE DYNAMICS ON BOTH IN SACRAMENTO AND AT THE LOCAL LAW REGARDING HOUSING AND I THINK YOU SEE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS WANTING TO TRY TO MAKE THINGS WORK BUT BEING CAUGHT UP AND- KIND OF THEIR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN KIND OF STRUGGLING GIVEN THE- REDEVELOPMENT. THE THING OF ALL OF THE LOCAL WELL WITH WITH. TO BUILD CAPACITY IN I KIND OF GET ON THE RIGHT TRACK BUT BUT TO THE EXTENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS- IMPACT FEES COULD BE REDUCED- IT WOULD IT WOULD RESULT IN THE DIRECT PRODUCTION OF MORE UNITS. THANK YOU I KNOW SKINNER HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU THEN APOLOGIES THAT I MISSED SOME OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS- BUT I WONDERED IF ON THIS NOTE IF WE ARE SEEING TREND OF CITIES REDUCING THE FEES. THE I DON'T THE PRICE PERCENT AFFORDABLE BUT ALSO MEAN LIKE IF YEAR WE HAVE THE BUILDING WOULD SAY SIXTY MARKET RATE THIRTY YEAR TWENTY AFFORDABLE ARE THEY REDUCING THE FEES FIND IS THE TREND TO REDUCE THE FEES ON THOSE OR IS IT NOT AND THEN ON THE E. U.'S. SO WE HAVE IN OUR PACKET THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA ORDINANCE BASICALLY LIMITED AMIDST ALL THE FEES ON YOU SO THAT IT'S ONLY IF THOUSAND DOLLAR. BUILDING I'M THE PLEDGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR PUT SOME SOME LIMITS ON EIGHTY FEES BUT NOT IT'S STILL BE QUITE HIGH IN IN A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS EVEN THOUGH WE GET OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT IS THERE A TREND NOW. REDUCING THOSE FEES OR NOT. I CAN TRY TO ADDRESS THE EIGHTY YOU IN THE MARKET RATE UNIT QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY TO LET YOU TURN THINGS OVER ON THE AFFORDABLE SIDE- ON THE- ON THE EIGHTY USE I THINK THAT EXAMPLE WAS REALLY A PERFECT REFERENCE TO MAYBE SHOW EVERYBODY THE OKAY OF FEES AND HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND I KNOW ON THE STATE AND GLOBAL BASIS WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY YOU CAN SEE IF YOU DO PRICES YOU MORE. THE WAY WITH. THE PROBLEM IS WE STILL NEED THOSE IN AND ALL THE JOY. LOCALLY THAT WE BUILD AND WHETHER IT'S PARKS ROAD SEWER WATER ALL THOSE KIND OF THING SO IT'S NOT THAT WERE ADVOCATING TO JUST DO AWAY WITH FEES WHAT WE'RE REALLY DISCUSSING HERE IS TRYING TO MAKE SIMPLE DECISIONS ON HOW TO WE SHOULD THE BURDEN OF RESPONSE THEY KEEP THE HIGH CALL OF LIFE. PENSIONS MANY THE JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE THE HIGH FEES ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT ARE BUILDING THE MOST HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW SO IT'S CONVERSE TO THE HIGHEST CITIES PRETTY LAST HOUSING BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT'S JUST KIND OF A BAD ACTOR DURATION BUT NORMALLY THE- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD MORE HOUSING HAVE HIGHER FEES. WITH IT RATE AND THEN DOING CLUES ARE UNITS WERE THIS THE TOP. FORTY THAT WOULD REFER TO SAN. UP I'M NOT FEE REDUCTIONS IF ROSESTO GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY PROGRAM AND THEN WE END UP BECOMING A PREVAILING WAGE REQUIRED- SITUATION SO GENERALLY SPEAKING NOW ON ON THE COMBINED PROJECTS THROUGH INCLUSIONARY ZONING WE CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY FEE REDUCTION. AND I. YOU CAN REST OF IT SURE. FROM MY EXPERIENCE- MOST JURISDICTIONS ARE STILL LIMITING THEIR FEE WAIVERS ARE DEFERRALS WHICH IS THE TWO CAN REMAIN PROGRAMS THAT THAT- JURISDICTIONS ARE USING TO REDUCE FEES- FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY DEFINE AFFORDABLE UNITS SAYS THE PERSON. IN AN 8% HUNTER AND TWENTY I THINK IT REALLY VARIES AMONG JURISDICTION- BUT BUT I WILL NOTE- THAT- IT IS TRUE THAT AS YOU KNOW FEE WAIVERS I'M DUE IN. DEVELOPMENTS IN IN A WAY THAT THAT TRIGGERS PREVAILING WAGE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS HAVE DEFERRAL PROGRAMS AT LONG TERM REFERRAL PROGRAM SO I'M- AND THAT'S THE WAY IT I AND SURE THAT THE PROJECT IS ABLE. TO MOVE OR AND THE SUBJECT PREVAILING WAIT SO THAT WAY. THE STRUCTURE. TO FOUND THANK COSTS OF. IN DIFFERENT THAT ARE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO FOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT. ONE THING ALLOWED TO YEAR. SENATORS AT- YOU KNOW WE TRY TO TRACK EIGHTY USE PRETTY CLOSELY AND WE HAVE SEEN MORE MORE CITIES- START IF THEY'RE IMPACT FEES FOR TO SPEAK TO ONE UNITS ARE ON IT WE ARE TOO BECAUSE OF THAT EARLIER AND IT IT ALSO. BECAUSE PUSHING SIT. HERE THIS DO WE WANTED TO ALLOW THE STATE DOES GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT SO THAT IS. SO WE SEE THIS AS A POSITIVE STEP. ASKING THE QUESTIONS CENTER ALSO FREE HI SORRY I MISSED- SOME OF YOUR PRESENTATION- YOU MENTION THAT- I THINK IT WAS YOU I'M SORRY YOUR NAME DAVE. THE YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE AREAS WHERE HIGH FEES ARE PRODUCING MORE HOUSING COULD YOU EXPLAIN HEALTH IT CAN BE. THAT CAN BE THE- RIGHT GIVE ME A COPY THING AND THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT THE- AS IS INDICATED THAT FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA MOST OF THE EXAMPLES IN THERE ARE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE PUT ON THE MOST OF OUR WORK AND I HAD TO QUIT SACKS TO THE IN. FOR TODAY. ALL THIS IS. IN THE FEES ARE REAL HIGH THERE TO EAT PER WHICH IS A BIG CHUNK IS YOU HEARD SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY OF WHAT GOES INTO THE ULTIMATE- PRODUCTION OF A HOME. VERSUS SOME OF THE INFILL THAT YOU'LL SEE HERE ON THE AFFORDABLE WORDS MUCH MORE MODEST IN THE TO SEE THAT BE THE CASETHIS IS ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT WE BUY OUT OF. HOLDEN WHY STATE AND IDAHO ARE FEES ARE USUALLY 123% PER AVERAGE- SALES VALUE FOR THAT PRODUCT VERSES THE 10218% YOU SEE THERE. BUT ALL THE COMMUNITIES WHICH- WERE PRODUCING THE MOST AMOUNT OF HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA. HAS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDE THOSE COMMUNITY SERVICES IS A GENTLEMAN FROM RIVERSIDE INDICATED SO. IT'S A TRADE OFF WERE WERE BUILDING HOUSES WHERE WE CAN BUILD. AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK- FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. AND WE'RE NOT BUILDING HOUSES WHERE THE JOBS ARE SO THEN WE PUT THE AND WE PUT THE STRESS ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED MORE MEDI XIN MORE IMPACTS. THAT MISSIONAL STRUCTURE MEETS THE BILL LIKE PARKS AND ROADS AND SEWER AND WATER AND SUCH. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S- NOBLE AND- IN THE MARKET FOR. WE CAN MAKE IT WORK AT A LOT OF THE EXTENT AND BUT DO SEE HIGHER FEES AND MOST PLACES THAT WE BUILT. BECAUSE THAT'S A NEWER. THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE CORRECT. SO I WAS GOING TO ASK WITH SOUNDS LIKE I'M GETTING PARTIAL ANSWER HERE IS WHAT IS. WHAT IS THE SORT OF ACCEPTABLE FEES AND I ASSUME THAT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE DOING THE BUILDING NO THE CONSTRUCTION AND AT WHAT POINT DO THESE FEES REALLY HELP. MORE CONSTRUCTION MORE MORE BUILDING AND ESPECIALLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE THOUGHTS OF IT YOU KNOW RIGHT OTHERWISE I THINK WE JUST SHOOTING IN THE DARK OF LET'S REDUCE FEES BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW AT WHAT POINT. IT KICKS IN TO ACTUALLY HELP. ABSOLUTELY AND ACTION AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WITH A VERY COMPLEX RESPONSE I THINK YOU HAVE SOME OF THE BEST EXPERTS- HERE BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING AND AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. RELATED TO THIS AND IT THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE CAN'T COME UP WITH A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING TO BE A WITH A ONE ALL FIX ALL FOR EVERYTHING. BUT WHAT I THINK I'M HEARING TODAY IS THAT THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND IT'S KIND OF THE CARROT AND THE STICK APPROACH MAYBE MAYBE WITH INCREASE PRODUCTION THIS COULD OFFSET SOME OF THE BURDEN. TO THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FIRE AND WATER AND SEWER AND- PARKS AND ROADS- TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO BRIDGE THAT GAP FOR THAT COMMUNITY. BENEFIT OR COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENTS OR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OF THE ENHANCED CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOP ANOTHER PRESSURE HOUSING THAT WE NEED I YOU CAN READ. SEE COMPLETE. IF DID FROM. THEM HI BUT THAT DOESN'T FIX. OUR LONG TERM ISSUE AND IT IS DIFFERENT EVERY YEAR YOU SEE THE ARE. PROJECTS AND CAL. IN AND MOST OF OUR BILL. REPRESENTED ARE DOING AND A LOT OF THE CITY'S A THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOU WERE FEES ARE MUCH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO THERE'S JUST NOT A GOOD FIX FOR EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S- SOME TOOL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO AMPLE. PLATE AVAILABLE ENSUE MUCH MORE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF ALL TYPES AFFORDABLE. MARKET RATE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. AND I AM FROM IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERSPECTIVE- THE WAY I AM THINK ABOUT THINGS IS EVERY DOLLAR REDUCTION IN FEES STRUCTURE CREATES ANOTHER DOLLAR FOR AN ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNIT- TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN- WAS THE LAST YEAR IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WHERETHE MAJOR FUNDING PROGRAMS THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND THE DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE WERE. ESSENTIALLY FULLY SUBSCRIBED AND WE PRODUCED- TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS AND- THE FUNDING PROGRAMS ARE ALL PREDICATED IT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO THE TOTAL PROJECT COST THOSE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND YOU. USE UP ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS WE CAN STRETCH THOSE RESOURCES THAT MUCH FURTHER SO- PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW A ONE TO HER HUMAN YOU KNOW A VERY NOMINAL DECREASE IN- IN FEES OF ANY NATURE OR COST OF ANY NATURE WILL DIRECTLY- RIPPLE IN THE PRODUCTION OF MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS. THANK YOU I MEAN MIGHT. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY'S CONCERN IS WE WANT MORE HOUSING WE NEED MORE HOUSING WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW AT WHAT COST ON OTHER ON OTHER ISSUES- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED PREVAILING WAGES- I DO BELIEVE IN- AND REALLY WAY JUST BECAUSE I THINK IN THE END WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. GETTING THE WAGES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME OR TO BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN. AND SO. THAT'S WHY I ASK ABOUT THE FEES BECAUSE IF FOR. LOWERING THE FEESSO MUCH THAT WE CAN'T DO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEN. WHO WHO IT'LL SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY FOR IT I GUESS THAT'S IN THE END SOMEBODY'S GOT PAID FOR SO. WHERE AND HOW AND WHO PAYS FOR THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LUXURY OF SAYING WORRY ABOUT THE- SEWER SYSTEM DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. COMING SYSTEM DON'T WANT AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR ALL THESE. NEW OUR HELP. IT'S SO YOU GOT TO PAY FOR IT SO I GUESS THE QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT'S THE QUESTION WE ALL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. IS WHO PAYS FOR IT- BECAUSE WE CAN'T ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THOSE THINGS. ONE THING I THINK IT'S BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS CONVERSATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USED TO PLAY A BIG ROLE BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE A LONG TIME AGO- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO BE CONTINUALLY INVESTING IN. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE OTHER PARTY THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION- THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE MANY PARTIES- THAT A- AND NEXT ADMINISTRATION- MAY PRIORITIZE AS INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT SO. THAT THE BEES MAY CONSIDER AS WELL OKAY. OKAY I WILL ADD FROM THE VA THERE'S PERSPECTIVE THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE BUILDERS ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR OUR CERTAINTY REGARDING TIME. AND CERTAINTY REGARDING COST SO INSTEAD OF PERHAPS LOOKING AT WHO'S GOING TO SPEND THE DOLLAR BY REDUCING COLLECTIVELY HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST OF WE CAN ALL BENEFIT AND THE TWO THINGS THAT HELP US WITH THAT% ARE CREATING CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE TIMING FOR OUR PROCESS. AND HOW MUCH WE WILL BE SPENDING TOTAL- ON FEES SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS I WOULD SAY. THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO PROCESS THE PROJECT IS A HUGE IMPACT THAT. IF CAN'T IF IT IS ULTIMATELY REDUCED THEN ARE CARRYING COSTS THE OTHER PIECES OF THE PROJECT WE CAN MOVE MONEY FROM ONE POT TO ANOTHER TO HELP CREATE A TO PRODUCTION. THANK YOU. SO MORE LOCK. THANK YOU CHAIR AT DAVID. YOU'RE STILL BUILDING HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PROUD TO SAY THANK YOU YOU. SO I JUST WANT TO GO OVER THE MIDDLE A BRIEF SUMMARY AS QUICK AS I CAN A WHAT IF YOU KNOW THE WHAT I'VE GLEANED FROM TODAY THAT- YOU'RE STILL BUILDING- WE HAVE CYCLES FOR RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A CYCLE WHERE WE HAVE PENT UP DEMAND SO THIS IS LIKE THE IDEAL TIME FOR YOU BUILDINGS- IN PROVIDING A PRODUCT- YOU HAVE YOUR COST TO SAIL SO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE SLIDE UP YOU KNOW THE DETAILS. OF WHAT IT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT- IN THE END WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE COME UP WITH THE PRICE OF THIS JUST USE THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE MARKET WILL PAVE AT- SO YOUR RISK IS IF THE MARKET CHANGES IT COULD BE SEVEN FIFTY IT COULD BE SIX HUNDRED AND IT'S A GOES IT GETS A TO DIE FOR YOU OR TO GO TO. AND YOU REALLY GET A- YOU KNOW NAY LOW. OF THE MARKET CAN CHANGE ON A DIME WE SAW THAT THIS WEEK IN THE STOCK MARKET- SO YOU HAVE THAT RISK- AND WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY IS THAT IF WE REDUCE THE FEES THEN THE LAND PRICE GOES UP. SO YOU GET YOU STARTED DON'T GET A NET. BENEFIT SO AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU AND HELP EVERYONE ELSE. SO YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT KIND OF SPARKED MY INTEREST THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN OTHER STATES SO WHAT ARE THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WHAT ARE OTHER STATES DOING. THAT WE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED HERE. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO REALLY SAY THE ANSWER PUBLICLY. YES YES I DO. WELL I'VE I'VE AD IT IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS YEAH I KNOW I DON. ON I'M SORRY. I THINK YOU KNOW SOMEONE ELSE YEAH I KNOW E NEED SOME OTHER DEVELOPERS TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. I THINK THE MY DEVELOPER PRINTER BUILDING COLORADO YEAH. AND I RECENTLY SIR BUILDING AND IN IDAHO AND WASHING SURE STATE BECAUSE WHAT WE LIKE MOST PUBLIC BUILDERS HAVE TO PRAY OUR RESPONSIBILITY OUR LIABILITIES. AND IT'S BECOME VERY SPECULATIVE IN VERY RISKY IN CALIFORNIA TO. BE A PRIVATE HOME BUILDER. I TRIED TO GET MY SON THIRD GENERATION HOME BUILDER TO DO ANYTHING ELSE THAT HE WANTED BESIDES BECOMING A HOME BUILDER BUT I COULDN'T. HIM IS THIS IS WHAT HE REALLY WANTS TO DO HE KNOWS THAT HIS FATHER'S PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. I THE THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT YOU'VE SEEN THROUGH A LOT. INFORMATION TODAY IF YOU CAN REDUCE COST YOU CAN. MORE AND CALIFORNIA HOME BILL. ARE TRYING TO USE A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES ARE TRYING TO PRODUCES MANY HOMES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE'RE HERE TO BUILT AND IF WE CAN BUILD MORE WE WILL. THEN THE DILEMMA IS WE CAN'T GET THE REVENUES TO MEET THE EXPENSE SO IF WE CAN REDUCE. THE EXPENSES AND ALSO SLIGHTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE SO WE CAN MEET MORE OF THE CONSUMER PROFILE THE NEED FOR THE WORK FORCE HOUSING FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR THE HOUSING STOCK THAT'S REALLY GOING TO PUT PEOPLE BACK IN. THE SHELTER INSTEAD OF BEING ON SHELTERED. THAT'S OUR GOAL AND SO IF WE CAN REDUCE. ANY PART OF THE COST EQUATION I GIVE YOU THE TEN LINE ITEM THERE'S EIGHT OF THEM THAT WE CAN WORK ON. I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT THE MONEY WOULD GO BACK TO THE LANDOWNERS RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT BUILDING HOMES BECAUSE THERE'S% NO RESIDUAL LAND TO A LOT OF. LAND THAT IS BUILDABLE FOR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA- THERE MAY BE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE VALUES DO DO GO UP. SLIGHTLY BUT WHAT BUT LEAVING THE REVENUE WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW ISN'T THE ANSWER WE NEED TO BRING THE COST OF ALL HOUSING DOWN OF THE REASON WHY THE COST KEEPS GOING UP IS. YOU CAN EASILY SEE FOR MY INFORMATION IN THE PERFECT. IF THE FEES FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. REPRESENT 10% OF THAT COST I IN THE FEES ARE PER UNIT AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. I COULD REDUCE THAT LINE ITEM THE HOUSE. AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY HOMES BEING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ARE FOR THE HAVES OR THE HAVE NOTS WE'RE MISSING THE MIDDLE WHICH IS THE WORK FORCE HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE IMPLEMENTS IS FEES IT'S AN ISSUE. THAT HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FORTY SOME YEARS TO. THE VERY DISPARAGING SITUATION AND I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS IT IT'S JUST IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY AND FAIRLY. SO THAT WE DON'T IMPACT ALL THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND AS- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID WE IT'S YOU GOT A TRADE THE MONEY FROM ONE POCKET TO ANOTHER YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T JUST AS A SURLY TAKE ABOUT A ONE LINE ITEM AND PUT IT INTO. ANOTHER ONE SO WE TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE CITIES AND LOCAL RESTRICTIONS I GUESS THIS. FOR AFTER. PICK UP THE BALLOT. SO HEAD. MORE HERE I'M ASSUME MAYBE YOU BUILD MAREADY OR BOY IDAHO CORRECT WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE SIDE SIDE IN IN MERIDIAN RIGHT NOW HAVE COUPLE DEVELOP THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON HER FEES FOR A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLAR HOUSE THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN LIVERMORE ARE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE- IN THE- END THEY HAVE GREAT PARKS GREAT SCHOOLS GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE ALL THE WATER AND SEWER AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE NEED SO. WHERE WHERE THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THERE AND HERE BECAME I THINK IT'S A FORTY YEAR PROCESS THAT WE'VE- EVOLVED THROUGH. PROP THIRTEEN AND SEE CA AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE EVOLVED THE WAY I WE DEVELOP. IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'VE IMPOSING CALIFORNIA MAKE HOUSING SO EXPECT. BECAUSE I CAN GO THROUGH EVERY ONE OF THOSE EIGHT LINE ITEMS WITH YOU AND SHOW YOU WHERE REGULATION. HAS INCREASE OUR COSTS OF FINANCE INCREASE R. COSTA SALES INCREASE OUR COSTS AND INSURANCE. HOUSING PRODUCTION WHETHER IT'S MATERIALS OR FOR LAND USE WE CAN GO THROUGH EVERY ONE OF THOSE AND REGULATION IS INCREASE THE COST WE KEEP REGULATING TO TRY TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. BUT WE MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THAT ISN'T THAT THAT'S WHY YOU BILL TO GIVE ME. THERE YOU GO I WISH I WAS HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES WITH JUST FEES BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO. AFTER WE GOT IT WE GOT IT TO GET THE HATE OUT OFF THE LINE OFTEN ON THE FLOOR AND WAY THERE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. TODAY IS HERE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. YOU KNOW I'M WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP. EARLY ADOPTER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO HELP. THEY MAY ASK ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT WISH TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. IF NOT I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL IN ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS- THERE ARE OBVIOUS IS A LOT FOR US TO DIGEST AND I'M SURE IT WILL BE TAKING THESE LEARNINGS AND TWO. MORE POLICY DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WITHOUT THIS IS NOW TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT TO WISH TO SAY A FEW WORDS- PLEASE LINE UP. AND WE WILL HEAR FROM THE FOR SPEAKER. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON WE CAN HEAR CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON- WANT TO COMMEND ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AND THE STAFF THAT PUT TOGETHER AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC HEARING THIS MORNING I AGREE A LOT TO DIGEST AND WORK ON AT RATHER THAN COMMENT ON ANY OF THE SPECIFIC POLICIES AND ISSUES THAT YOU CONTEMPLATED TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO USE MY TIME TO- OFFER THE URBAN COUNTIES OFFER AT THE ASSOCIATION AND OUR STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES TO ASSIST ALL OF YOU INTO A SINCE THE LEGISLATURE IN COMING UP WITH WORKABLE SOLUTIONS. AT THAT GET THE COST OF HOUSING- THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING SO- SOLVING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AT AS A I OF US WHO REALLY IS JUST AN ALL OF SOME AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERTISE AT HELP YOU DEVELOP THE LIST THANK YOU THANK. GOOD APP SO THE BAND THAT WHAT HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM. OUR FORTY ONE AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- HABITAT FOR HUMANITY- SERVES IN PARTNERS WITH LOW IN VERY LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES THERE'S AND VETERANS. THE HABITAT FAMILIES THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEIR OFTEN WORKING TWO TO THREE MINIMUM. WAGE JOBS JUST TO GET BY AND ARE OFTEN PAYING FIFTY PERCENT. OF THEIR GROSS MONTHLY INCOME ON RENT ALONE- THROUGH HABITAT THESE FAMILIES HELP BUILDING PURCHASE THEIR RESALE INDEED RESTRICTED HOMES BY PUTTING IN FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF SWEAT EQUITY- ALONGSIDE VOLUNTEERS AND THEY PURCHASED IT FOR A 0% THIRTY YEAR- MORTGAGE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR RESALE ON THE DEED RESTRICTIONS TYPICALLY SURPASSED THE LENGTH OF THE LOAN. AND IN MANY CASES THESE REMAIN AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY KEEPING IN AFFORDABLE HOME IN THE COMMUNITY FOR FUTURE LOW INCOME FAMILIES. SO AS WE KNOW THE HOMEOWNERSHIP- AND HOUSING PRODUCTION RATES ACROSS THE STATE- IT STARTLING LOWS AND ONE REASON IS IMPACT FEES WHICH WE ARE ALL HERE TO DISCUSS ACROSS THE STATE THESE COST HABITAT. AMENITY AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA 25233% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST PER UNIT- THESE CAN RANGE FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DEPENDING ON WHERE. THE HOME IS BEING BUILT- AND MANY OF THESE HOMES ACTUALLY ALL THESE ONES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE STATE INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM I TACK. AS THESE ARE BUILT FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND SO WE- WE- SAY THAT THE HIGH IMPACT THESE CAN NOT ONLY BE CRIPPLING BUT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE TWENTY- OR EVEN THOUSANDS MORE INDIVIDUALS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A STATE FOR STABLE HOUSING- AND A HAND UP OUT OF POVERTY. SO WE NEED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES IN MITIGATING AND LOWER LOWERING THESE FEES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LIKE HABITAT IS ONE STEP IN THAT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY ON FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE MIXTURES MEMBERS CHASE RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. I THINK I THINK IS VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS YEAR AND I THOUGHT WAS WELL DONE. STAFF WAS EXCELLENT THE PRESENTATIONS WERE WERE FANTASTIC AND I GOT I LEARNED A LOT. I'M TODAY SOBRE BILLS DID AS WELL- YOU KNOW IN THIS DISCUSSION I MEAN I THINK YOU WE CAN ALL AGREE. ON THAT AND THAT THESE SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT THE FACILITIES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I MEAN WE NEED A BETTER JOB TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO FUND THIS- IN THAT WE CAN'T TRACK ONE. WITH ALL OF THOSE COSTS AND I. HAVE IN IDEA HERE TODAY I THINK A CENTER RAZA HIT ON THE HEAD AND THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY. FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS IT IS CRITICAL WE ALL WANT VIBRANT COMMUNITIES TO LIVE IN WITH ALL ONE GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE PARKS. I DON'T IT. I KNOW IMAGE THAT TODAY BUT THERE'S THIS REAL BATTLE. WE DO TO IMPROVE THAT. TODAY YOU KNOW. TO STUDIES KNOW HAPPEN FEES IT. SAID HE'S- TAKING ALL AT THE MITIGATION FEE. I MEAN. I DON'T. THINGS WITH. IT FOR A COUPLE DECADES SO.
