00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.276
RESOLUTION TO STAND FOR WHAT IS

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.846
CHEST. AS WE SEE PEOPLE SO

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:25.381
CRAVING FOR POWER THAT THEY WILL

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:28.051

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:30.720
A LIE. DO YOU SAY AND DO

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:34.090
NOTHING. OR DO YOU SPEAK UP EVEN

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:35.258

UPON. THIS HISTORIC FIGURE DR

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:46.496

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.603
THE CURVE OF HISTORY. AND YET I

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:06.149
HAS RESPONSIBILITY AN OFFICE

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:08.551
FROM WHICH WE TOO CAN WORK TO

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:10.987
BEND THE CURVE OF HISTORY. SO IT

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:13.089
IS RIGHT THAT WE LOOK TO HIM FOR

INSPIRATION. AND I WANT TO

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.595
AFFIRM THAT THIS THIS IS THE

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.463
INHERENT NATURE OF OUR WORK. AND

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:24.534
PARDON ME FOR THIS REMINDER.

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:28.171

LEGISLATURE WAS SEATED. AND IT

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.510
IS THE FIRST LEGISLATURE SEATED

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:35.545

COMPRISED OF ONE OUTLOOK ONE

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:47.357
VIEW IS NOT A LUXURY BODY. I

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.058
THINK WHAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:52.562
STAND FOR IS THE EMBODIMENT. OF

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:54.197
WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE SPIRIT OF

INQUIRY OF THIS BODY THE SPIRIT

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.500
OF ADVOCACY OF THIS BODY. THAT

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:00.270
WE ARE ALWAYS IN THE FACE OF THE

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:03.439
NEEDS THAT WE SEE. OPEN TO SEE

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.608
AN AND ARTICULATED WHAT MIGHT

SEEM TO SOME AS WILD IDEAS. AND

AFFECTING HISTORY. AND AS SOON

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:28.564
AS YOU START GOING DOWN THAT

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.300
TRAIL OF BEING OPEN TO WILD

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:31.734

IT. AND THEN AND ALL OF THIS WE

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:47.750
