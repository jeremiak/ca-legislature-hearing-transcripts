ON EDUCATION FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WONDERING. WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING -- SINGLE BUDGET ITEM TODAY IT'S ITEM SIXTY FOUR FORTY IT'S THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE GONNA SHAKE UP THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA JUST A LITTLEBIT BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME PANELISTS -- THAT NEED TO LEAVE EARLY TO CATCH FLIGHTS SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE ISSUE NUMBER. SIX UC MEDICAL EDUCATION FIRST FOLLOWING OF THE PRESENTATION OF ISSUE SIX I WILL TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUES THAT THESE PANELISTS COVERS SO THAT THEY CAN HEAR. THE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE THEY NEED TO LEAVE AND THEN WE WILL GO BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER. ONE AND TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE AGENDA IN ORDER WITH PUBLIC COMMENT FOLLOWING. AT THE END OF ISSUE NUMBER. NINE SO THAT'S THE OF BATTING ORDER TODAY. AND WE'LL START WITH OUR ISSUE NUMBER SIX PANEL. ONCE EVERYBODY -- FINDS A CHAIR IN THE MUSIC STOPS. LET'S -- HAVE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR. GOOD MORNING JAX WALLS FROM A FINANCE THANK YOU. WALT DISNEY CONCENTRATORS LEGENDS OFFICE. TO ROSE. ANGELA GILYARD DIRECTOR OF GOOD TO SEE YOU MA'AM BECAUSE OUR NATION ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT -- IN THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE MA'AM I'M DEPUTIES THEM THE DAY AND AT THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UC RIVERSIDE. THANKS FOR JOINING US OKAY WHO WANTS TO START ON ISSUE NUMBER. SIX GOOD MORNING -- SO THIS IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION SHIFTED GENERAL FUND OUT OF USES BASED BUDGET -- AND BACK FILL THOSE FUNDS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SPONSORS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT PROVIDED FORTY MILLION ONE TIME -- TO OFFSET THAT BACK FILL IN THE IN THIS CURRENT YEAR -- THAT MAY PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR STATEWIDE GRANT PROGRAM OPERATED BY PHYSICIANS FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TO EXPAND RESIDENCY SLOTS STATEWIDE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FORTY MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO ADD TO THE SIDE AND THE THE THIS OFF THAT I IN THE LONG RUN SO THAT -- THIS PROGRAM HAVE LONG TERM FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. YES SIR. THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE WHERE OUR OFFICE HAS A HARD RECOMMENDATION -- BUT TO BUILD OFF OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRESENTATION. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE TWENTY SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA. THAT PAGE ARE THE TABLE ON THAT PAGE SHOWS HOW THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE TIME FUNDS WERE WERE SPENT ON THE PROPOSITION. FIFTY SIX I MEAN YOU CAN SEE THAT. I'M A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE FUNDS WORK TO SUPPORT. NEW RESIDENCY SLOTS AND WHAT THAT MEANS OUR IS SLOTS -- THE KIND OF GROWTH IN EXISTING PROGRAMS -- AND THEN THE OTHER REMAINING PORTION WAS. FOR THE KIND OF SUSTAINED EXISTING SLOTS AND AN EXISTING PROGRAM SO THAT WASN'T THAT DOESN'T REFLECT GROWTH THAT'S KIND OF SUSTAINING THE SLOTS THAT THE THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME SENSE -- AS TO HOW THE FUNDS MIGHT BE SPENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I'M SO I THOUGHT THAT INFORMATION MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND I'M HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THIS ITEM DO YOU FIND A PROBLEM WITH THAT [inaudible] BREAKDOWN. WHAT? IN WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTING SLOT SO I THINK THE THE KEY QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE -- SOME PROGRAMS MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME SUSTAINING SLOTS IF THEY RUN OUT OF FUNDING OR IF THEY DON'T. QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL FUNDING SAY FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY DON'T -- PROVIDE INPATIENT SERVICES OR IF THEY DON'T SERVE AND AN OLDER POPULATION THAT'S GENERALLY SERVED BY MEDICARE. THEN EXISTING THOUGHTS MIGHT HELP SUSTAIN SOME OF THOSE -- RESIDENCY BASS LOTS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE JUST HOLDING A FLAT IT MIGHT NOT BE ADDRESSING -- SHORTAGES THAT EXIST IN THE STATE SO THATTHAT'S KIND OF A A KEY QUESTION TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS DATA. WELL MAYBE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE THE PANEL THIS CAN CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL. I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD I CAN UNDERSTAND COVERING EXISTING RESIDENCIES WHEN [inaudible] ADMINISTRATION PULLED. FOURTEEN AS I RECALL PULLED FORTY MILLION OUT OF THE BACK AND AND THEN. AND THEN SO WE HAD A WE HAD AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A NET INCREASE IN MONEY I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. BUT NOW WITH THE MONEY RESTORED I THINK TO UC. AND THEN FORTY MILLION ON TOP MAYBE SOMEONE COULD ADDRESS THE USE OF THAT MONEY FOR EXISTING RESIDENCY PROGRAM JUST OPPOSED TO GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM AS WE MOVE. AS WE MOVE DOWN THE LINE. AND THEN ONE OF MY OTHER -- CONCERTS CONCERNS AND IT IT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF PROP FIFTY SIX IN THE LANGUAGE OF PSYCHIATRY IS NOT IN THE LIST IN TERMS OF OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND MY RECOLLECTION IS IT'S NOT. SO LONG BROWN EITHER. AND PSYCHIATRY -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OF COURSE ARE A BIG ISSUE OF FOR MOST AND IF NOT ALL IN THIS BUILDING AT LEAST IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND HOW WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND CERTAINLY IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE SO. JUST SOME COMMENTS [inaudible] REFINISH HER [inaudible] OKAY. GOOD MORNING HI MISTER CHAIR -- I'D FIRST LIKE TO JUST START BY SAYING -- AND BUILDING ON THE COMMENTS OF THE AT A PREVIOUS SPEAKERS -- THE UNIVERSITY ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP THROUGH M. O. U. WITH PHYSICIANS FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA -- IT THE THROUGH THE M. AUDIO ESTABLISHED ABOARD A FIVE MEMBER BOARD A FIFTEEN MEMBER ADVISORY COUNCIL TO HELP MAKE DECSIONS ABOUT I THE PROGRAM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM IN THE GIVING OF THE GRANTS AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS WOULD BE A STATE WIDE. ADEQUATE -- BALLOT INITIATIVE AND SO TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROVIDES SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE FIVE CATEGORIES LISTED -- IN THE ANALYSIS AND SO SINCE THIS WAS YEAR TWO OF PROP FIFTY SIX WE WANTED TO STAY. AS CLOSE AS AND NOT EVEN BECAUSE WE WANTED TO EXACT. WITH A BALLOT INITIATIVE LANGUAGE -- WE THOUGHT IT WOULD IT WAS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE. NEEDED -- THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE THE THE THE THE VARIOUS KICK OUT OF THE NEED WITHIN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES AND THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE DISTRIBUTION IN THE STATE -- THAT ALIGN WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE YOU KNOW TO SEARCH FOR ACTIVE PROGRAMS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND SO FORTH WELL WE MAY BE RESTRICTED TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE I DON'T KNOW SO WELL YOU'RE PROBABLY SAFE SAFE IS DOING NOT NOT EXACTLY THAT SIR SO I WILL. SAY THIS YES AND YOU'RE ONE ABSOLUTELY THE BALLOT INITIATIVE DOES REQUIRE THAT -- THAT THEY THE THE DISTRIBUTION HOWEVER THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT ALLOWS FOR STUDY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL PERFORM FORCE AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN FUTURE YEARS THE DISTRIBUTION OR THE CATEGORIES COULD BE SHIFTED BUT INITIALLY GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE FUNDS BEING REDIRECTED -- AND THE SECOND YEAR THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE FIRST YEAR OF THE OPPOSITION FOR HAVE A CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WE FELT IT MADE. THE AND AND AND A LONG WITH THE FIFTEEN MEMBER ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS FELT THAT IT WAS ADVISABLE TO STICK WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE LANGUAGE AS WRITTEN -- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT PSYCHIATRY IS IN NEED -- AND BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN IN FUTURE YEARS WE DO STILL HAVE QUITE A DEMAND. ON THE CATEGORIES LISTED THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THERE'S THIRTY MILLION AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS. AND IT WITH A VERY SHORT TIME LINE -- FOR ADVERTISING TO GRANTEES AND HAVE THEM -- RESPOND IN THIS ACTUALLY OVER THAT OF THAT I'VE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY SEASON WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION. IN RICK -- GRANT REQUESTS RESPONSES I NEED IN RESPONSE -- TO THEY THEY JUST THEY THEY THEY WERE TAUGHT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION WHICH I THINK. BODES WELL FOR SAYING THIS MONEY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED EVERY YEAR -- TO THIS PROGRAM SO THAT -- YOU KNOW WE CAN BEGIN TO TO TO HAVE A STEADY WAY OF OF MEETING SOME OF IT THE DEMAND OF THAT STATE. OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION -- ALSO SAY THAT PART OF THE DECISION -- TO AND YOU LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OR SOME NEW PROGRAMS AND SOME EXISTING PROGRAMS. EXISTING -- GRADUATE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS CAN BE -- FUNDED THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOURCES IT'S NOT JUST ONE SOURCE MANY MANY EXISTING PROGRAMS RUN THROUGH GRANTS FROM FROM PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS THERE MAYBE FEDERAL GRANTS ARE USED SO GO. AND MAYBE SOME INSTITUTIONAL MONEY -- THE SERVICE -- FUNDED SO WE THOUGHT THAT. WELL THE GOAL TO EXPAND IS OUT OF A GOAL AND TO ADD NEW SLOT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE SLOTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE IN JEOPARDY OR NOT FIND IT SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT MIX. ALSO SO SO THE EXISTING RESIDENCY SLOTS WERE AT RISK OF LOSING FUNDING. FROM SOME PROGRAM PERHAPS OTHER THAN SOME ROUND OR RIGHT RIGHT. I SEE RIGHT EXACTLY SIR SO I THINK THAT THAT OVERALL THE THE TAKE AWAY WITH A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IN YEAR TWO GOING FORWARD YOU IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW A GREAT NEED IN IN IN TERMS OF PSYCHIATRY -- WE WE DO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR PSYCHIATRY I DON'T THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE WILL OFFER INTEREST FOR PSYCHIATRY -- WORK FORCE MAYBE -- THAT'S A SOURCE BUT I I DO THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM THE INTEGRITY OF THE ADVISORY GROUP IN AND THE THE BOARD IN UNIVERSITY OF REALLY WORKED HARD. TO ESTABLISH AT AT A GOOD PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR TO YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES I'M VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT -- WITH THE PROGRESS THAT YOU MADE AND YOU I MEAN. THERE IS A NEED UP INTO A TREMENDOUS NEED UP AND DOWN THE STATE FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND AND THOSE. PRACTICE AREAS THAT ARE RELATED TO THAT -- AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY SO WE JUST. NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO FUND ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY SLOTS BECAUSE WHILE WE WILL HEAR ABOUT. AN INITIATIVE OF MINE A LITTLE BIT LATER HAVING TO DO WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL BUILDING -- TURNING OUT -- TO THOSE WITH THROUGH TO GRADUATE WITH A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE -- IS ONLY HALF OF THE SOLUTION AND IF THEY DON'T FIND A RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY THE THEY FIND ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IF THEY DON'T WE MAY HAVE LOST THEM -- IN IN IN THIS STATE AND CERTAINLY IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS SO. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO ABSOLUTELY NO YOU'LL TO MIGHT HAVE. OTHER PANELS -- OKAY ALL ALL ALL ALL BE BRIEF -- BUT IT IS PART OF MY INTRODUCTION AND AN ADDITION TO SERVING AS THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR HEALTH SCIENCES. SYSTEM WIDE THAT THAT INCLUDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN OUR GMT PROGRAMS. YOU SEE OPERATES ROUGHLY HALF OF THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND IN THE STATE. I ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS A GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE ON THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE ANGELUS COMMENT TO THAT. IN A VERY SHORT TIME LINE FROM THE NORTH OF THE STATE TO THE SOUTH FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE TO THE COAST THOUGHT THIS FUNDING -- AND WE FELL A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS SHORT -- OF NEED I THINK WITH ANOTHER YEAR OF AWARENESS ABOUT THESE FUNDS THE VOLUME WILL WILL DOUBLE. I'M A SECOND POINT IS THAT -- CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY LEADS THE NATION IN TERMS OF THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT FOR PHYSICIANS TO COMPLETE RESIDENCY TRAINING HERE ACCORDING TO IT AMC STATS. SO NOW LARGELY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL. SCHOOL APPLICANTS LIKE. TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION HERE WE EXPORT -- SO MANY STUDENTS FROM MANY LISTINGS COME BACK HERE TO COMPLETE THE RESIDENCY TRAINING AND WHEN WE DO CALIFORNIA'S VERY SUCCESSFUL IN RETAINING THESE FOLKS AS PART OF OUR WORK FORCE SO. CLEAR NEED CLEAR RETURN ON INVESTMENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN THE MORNING I'M MRS SHARE. HERE TO SPEAK ON THE CHAIRS FOR A CLASS IS ALLOCATED DISH NO FUNDING DID YOU SEE OUR MEDICINE. WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT ISSUE THAT WORKS I THINK WE'RE STILL ON PROPOSITION. FIFTY SIX RIGHT NOW OKAY I THINK WHAT AS I'M LOOKING AT THE AGENDA SO YOU TELL ME BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE. WE'RE GONNA TALK -- WE'RE GONNA FINISH TALKING ABOUT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM THE PRIME PROGRAM HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY WILL TALK TO THAT -- HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY WILL TALK TO THE PSYCHIATRY AT USE YOUR TELEMEDICINE. INITIATIVE AND THEN WE'LL GET -- TO BY -- INITIATIVE HAVING TO DO WITH THE YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SO OKAY SO I DO HAVE A COMMENT ON HOW FIFTY SIX FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. AND I JUST WANT -- TO UNDERSCORE WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID [inaudible] I THE SIDE AND AND THE DEAN AT UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. AND AS SHIA NARROW AND THE INLAND EMPIRE THERE REALLY IS A DIRE NEED. FOR PHYSICIANS AS WELL AS FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS. AS KATHERINE -- SO ELOQUENTLY STATED. WHEN WE? EDUCATE THESE PHYSICIANS AND KEEP THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN. AND I'LL GOAL IS. TO EDUCATE. HAVE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THEM. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY REMAIN IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR POSITION. I HOPE THEY DO. WE DO NEED THEM. OKAY IS THAT FINISH PROP FIFTY SIX ABOUT [inaudible] OKAY -- LET ME BEFORE I BEGAN ASK. WHETHER. YOU BY CHANCE WE HAVE COPIES. I I'M. FIVE WE'LL REFER TO THIS -- AS I PROVIDE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS A AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO MAKE -- FIVE THE IMPETUS FOR OUR UC PRIME PROGRAMS. BEGAN ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND IT WAS A STRATEGY -- FOR EXPANDING MEDICAL SCHOOL IN ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES SO THIS. PREDATES THE TRANSITION MEDICINE AND OUR OUR THINKING REALLY WAS THAT WE COULD ACCOMMODATE SOME GROWTH WITHIN EXISTING MEDICAL SCHOOLS. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF BASIC SCIENCES AND CLINICAL SCIENCES AND ACCREDITATION OF THOSE SCHOOLS. BUT ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF GROWTH WOULD BE POSSIBLE BASED UPON SPACING CAPITAL NEEDS -- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU SEE -- TATE DEVELOPED SOME INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE FELT -- WOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICALLY WAS A STRATEGIC DECISION SYSTEM WIDE DECISION. WITH LOCA AUTHORITY BY THE DEANS AND BY THE FACULTY AND WE HAD SOME GRANT SUPPORT EARLY ON TO ASSIST WITH PLANNING WE VETTED THIS WITH OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AT THAT TIME WITH WITH STATE LEADERSHIP AT THAT TIME AND AGAIN THIS IS. PRE RECESSION BUT IT WAS A STRATEGIC AN INITIATIVE AGAIN TAKE INCREASE CLASS SIZE BUT TO DO IT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY -- WE WERE POST PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT -- ELEMENTS OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD SEEK TO RECRUIT STUDENTS AND THEN RETURN STUDENTS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES OF GREATEST NEED. SO WE IDENTIFIED -- SIX CORE ELEMENTS FOR EACH OF OUR PRIME PROGRAMS YOU SEE THEM. YOU SEE THEM LISTED IN TERMS OF THEIR SPACE AND IN TERMS OF THEIR NAME -- BUT WE ASK -- WITH THE PLANNING MONIES THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR EACH DEAN'S OFFICE. TO IDENTIFY A UNIQUE AREA OF FOCUS THE STUDENTS TO FACULTY TO OTHERS. WE ASK EACH CAMPUS TO PLANT A STUDENT OUTREACH -- AND RECRUITMENT STRATEGY TO SEEK TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS -- LIKELY. TO WANT TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY TO THE AREA OF FOCUS THAT WE WERE LOOKING TO ADVANCE. WE ASK -- I DO A LOT OF WORK IN MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMISSIONS AND KNOW THE COMPLEXITY AND THE VOLUME. SO WE ASK EACH PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA MOST OF OUR PRIME STUDENTS HAVE TO BE ADMITTED TO A UC MEDICAL SCHOOL -- AND THEN THEIRSUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA TO ASSESS QUALIFICATIONS TO BE ADMITTED TO R. PRIME PROGRAMS I'M SO THIS IS ABOUT STUDENT FIT. ON WE WE ASK AND MINDFUL OF HOW IMPACTED THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM IS THERE ARE INTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS AND WANT TO STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. I'M SO THIS IS NOT A REWRITE OF THE CURRICULUM IT'S IT'S INCREMENTAL ENHANCEMENT -- SO WE ASK -- THAT. FOR EACH PROGRAM HAND SMIT IN THE PRECLINICAL YEARS THIS IS ONE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR BASIC SCIENCES SO EXAMPLES MIGHT BE INSTRUCTION OR LECTURES ON DISPARITIES IN HEALTH STATUS -- THERE IS AN EXAMPLE. FOR IRVINE PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON THE LATINO COMMUNITY THIS IF THIS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN IN MEDICAL SPANISH -- IN THE CLINICAL CLERKSHIP HERE'S THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR WE ASK THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION BE MADE TO PLACE OUR PRIME STUDENTS. IN THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD END. CREATE THEIR SKILL SET FOR FUTURE PRACTICE IN THOSE SETTINGS AND THEN WE ASK FOR CLEAR FACULTY MENTOR SHIP THE DECISION MAKING WAS LOCAL -- YOU'LL SEE EXAMPLES THAT ARE LISTED THAT ARE HERE -- WE HAVE SIX PRIME PROGRAMS IN THE UC SYSTEMNOW WITH A TOTAL ENROLLMENT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR STUDENTS THIS IS OVER. ALL PROGRAMS AND OVER ALL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM SO MEDICAL SCHOOLS A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM BY AND LARGE. AMONG THOSE. STUDENTS 64% I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- THIS MOSTLY BECAUSE I LIVE IN THIS SPACE BUT 64% OF THE STUDENTS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN MEDICINE. SO THIS LOOKS LIKE -- A LEVEL OF DIVERSITY THAT IS MUCH NEEDED IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA BUT IT BUT THAT IS REALLY HE SELDOM SEEN. AMONG U. S. MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE PROGRAM AND WE I ATTRIBUTED. TO OUTREACH AND TO THE ELEMENTS THAT I'VE DESCRIBED FOR EACH SO I I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS FOR EACH. BUT OUR ROLE PRIME PROGRAMS AT DAVIS IS ALIGNED WITH THE MISSION OF THE DAVIS MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE RECRUITED FROM RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS AS AN OUTREACH STRATEGY. STUDENTS GET TAUGHT ABOUT DISPARITIES FACING RURAL COMMUNITIES STUDENTS GET PREFERENTIAL -- INSTRUCTION IN TELEMEDICINE IS A STRATEGY FOR INCREASING THEIR SKILL SET -- WE HAVE A PRIME LC PROGRAM DOWN AT UCI THE FIRST IN THE SYSTEM -- TOP OPEN WHERE -- STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. BUT THEN HAVE SOME TYPE OF INTERVIEW IN SPANISH TO ASSESS BASIC PROFICIENCY STUDENTS DO THEIR CLERKSHIPS IN MONO OR BILINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKING SETTINGS. ON OUR MOST RECENT PRIME PROGRAM IS A GEOGRAPHICALLY NAME PROGRAM -- FOR THE FAN WALKING VALLEY ON THAT PROGRAM HAPPENS TO HAVE BENEFITED BY THE LEADERSHIP OF ITS MEMBER GRAY WHO SECURED FUNDING FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM IN THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEAR. FOR THE FOR THE FUNDING PREDICAMENT -- PROBLEM IS -- IS SHOWN HERE ON PAGE TWO AND SO. AS WE BEGAN. TO LAUNCH AN ENROLL STUDENTS WE WE HAVE TO TELL OUR ACCREDITING BODY WE HAVE TO TELL THE LCM YOU WERE PLANNING TO INCREASE CLASS SIZE. WE HAD -- TO BEGIN TO RECRUIT THERE WAS A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THE TWO OR THREE YEARS LEADING TO THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST CLASS. AND THEN THE STATE'S ECONOMY BEGAN TO UNRAVEL ON SO THAT THE MISSION WAS GOOD THE AIM WAS GREAT THE ENTHUSIASM WAS HIDE THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. DID NOT ALIGN EIGHT IN ANY FAVORABLY WAY SO OUR SCHOOL'S MOVE FORWARD KID MET THEIR FIRST CLASSES OF PRIME AS THEY WERE READY AS THEY NOTICED THE CREDITORS AS THEIR FACULTY WERE PREPARED AS THEY WERE READY TO ADMIT -- AND AND WHAT. HAPPENED AGAIN IS SORT OF SHOWN HERE THE FIRST PRIME PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND ON AND SOMEBODY -- WAS A SEVEN I THINK IT'S SEVEN MAYBE IT WAS SIX WITH IT WAS THE FIRST THAT WE HAD DAVIS SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO IN ROLLING THEIR FIRST CLASSES. AND WE HAD THREE YEARS OF PLAN FUNDING SO WE WE CAME TO THE STATE. FUNDING AS OUR CLASS SIZES INCREASED THESE WERE INTENDED TO BE TWELVE STUDENTS TO FIFTEEN STUDENTS PER CLASS IN PRIME. WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT MISSION AND AND THEN YOU SEE THE EFFECTS OF OF THE STATE BUDGET AND MULTI YEAR CUTS IN UC FUNDING FOR HIGHER ED OVERALL SO WE'VE BEEN FROZEN WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO COME BACK TO SECURE THIS FUNDING -- AND THEY'RE OF SIMPLY BAN. AN ENSUING NUMBER OF DIFFICULT BUDGET YEARS AND COMPETING PRIORITIES -- FOR FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE SYSTEM -- SO WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY REGULAR SLOTS THE THESE ARE ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS -- WE'VE GRADUATED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY STUDENTS -- TO DATE BUT ONLY SEVENTY EIGHT OF OUR TOTAL COMPLEMENT OF PRIME POSITIONS ACROSS. OUR SYSTEM -- HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SO THIS IS MARGINAL GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS WHICH IS A HIGHER RATE. THAN FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IT DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF INSTRUCTION THE STUDENTS STILL PAY TUITION. PROFESSIONAL GRADE SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION AND MANY STILL END UP WITH SUBSTANTIAL DEBT TO HELP SO THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE STATE OF THE BUDGET IN THE PAST AND WITH THEM THE FUNDING LEVELS THAT YOU RECEIVED. HOW ARE ALL OF THE PRIME SO IT'S FUN IS IT DOES IT COME OUT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM? NOW MONEY ON IT YOU KNOW IT COMES FROM YOU KNOW WE WE INVESTED -- POLITICAL CAPITAL WITH FOUNDATIONS AS THESE PROGRAMS WERE LAUNCHED. THERE WITH LOCAL ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS DEAN'S LEVEL COMMITMENT TO TO MOVE FORWARD THERE WAS THE HOPE OF RETURNING ANNA. I DON'T THINK ANY NEAR TERM OPTIMISM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT THE RECESSION WAS ABOUT TO END -- BUT WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO KEEP A CRITICAL MASS OF IDENTITY. SO. SOME MEDICAL SCHOOLS HAVE -- PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT CALIFORNIAN DOWNS MINUTES FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IS NOT A SUPPORTER SOME HAVE HAD -- DEAN'S RESERVES. SOME SCHOOLS DECREASE THEIR CORE CLASS SIZE TO ACCOMMODATE A CRITICAL MASS OF PRIME STUDENTS IT'S BEEN A COMBINATION. AND IT'S BEEN A I YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A NEGOTIATION I WILL SAY. AT TIMES OF LEADERSHIP CHANGE AT TIMES OF ECONOMIC STRESS ARMS WHAT'S IN NEEDED IS TO SUSTAIN THE PROMINENT INCREASING CLASS SIZE THAT WE THOUGHT. WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ISSUE THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WITH WITH YOU SEE OUR AND TO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS AT RISK OF COMPETING PRIORITIES. JUST AS A AS A AS A DEDICATED -- PART OF USING ICLOUD WAS SEEMS LIKE AN ESSENTIAL PROGRAM OF THE THE EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT'S REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA WILL THAT FULLY FUND THE IT IT WILL FORM THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SLOT SYSTEM WIDE THAT HAVE NO GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. IT'LL FIND THOSE SLOTS AT A LEVEL OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT WHICH DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF MEDICAL EDUCATION. THIS WAS THE LAST RECOGNIZED FIGURE -- BY THE STATE THEY CAME IN CONNECTION WITH THE FUNDING FOR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM. SO OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM BENEFITS -- THROUGH A STATE BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR TWELVE STUDENTS PER YEAR WHICH IS THE SIZE OF MOST OF OUR PRIME PROGRAMS ACROSS FOUR YEARS MAKING IT. FORTY EIGHT SO THERE'S THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SO WE USE THAT AS A BASELINE FOR MARGINAL COST INCREASES. SO THIS WILL SECURE THE PROGRAMS IN PERPETUITY IN ADDITION TO THOSE FUNDS STUDENTS PAY -- PROFESSIONAL DEGREE SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION TWO THIRDS OF WHICH IS USED TO SUPPORT INSTRUCTION IN THIS PROGRAM IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT PAID BY ALL YOU SEE MEDICAL STUDENTS IN THE RANGE OF EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. A THIRD OF WHICH IS RETURNED TO AID. SEEMS LIKE A MODEST REQUEST TO ME. IT'S A MODEST REQUEST BY ANY MEANS AND MIGHT BE USED YOUR STRATEGIC PLANS TO THEY INCLUDE -- AN EXPANSION OF MAYBE REFERENCES. BLOW THROUGH MY HEAD THE NEXT. EXPANSION THE PRIME PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I WANT I WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF TIME -- ARE THE FUNDING REQUEST OF EIGHT THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ON FUNDED SLOTS WAS INCLUDED IN THE UNIVERSITY'S FORMAL FUNDING REQUEST WAS INCLUDED IN THE REGION'S BUDGET -- UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET -- OUR HOPE TODAY IS FOR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT TO INCLUDE THAT FUNDING REQUEST AS THE REGIONS HAVE REQUESTED IT. THERE IS -- CONSIDERABLE INTEREST I WILL SAY MY MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN SEEING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EXPAND -- I'M OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH EITHER -- INCREASES EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS SO YOU'LL YOU'LL NOTICE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THIS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PRIME FOR EVERY NEED AND THERE'S CONSIDERABLE NEED IN THE STATE. AND IT WAS A FUNCTION OF OF OF DECISION MAKING OUT THAT SIDE AT THAT TIME SO WE HAVE ONE THAT'S REGIONALLY IDENTIFIED WE COULD CERTAINLY HAVE MORE THAN. ONE WORLD PRIME MORE THAN ONE URBAN PRIME WE DON'T HAVE ALL PRIME -- THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT A PRIME PROGRAM FOR UC RIVERSIDE UC RIVERSIDE BEFORE IT BECAME AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL SCHOOL HAD A VERY SMALL PRIME PROGRAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH UCLA. HI HOW ARE YOU FEELING SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WITH THE LAST PROGRAM TO OPEN ITS PRIME PROGRAM AND THEREFORE HAS NO FUNDING FOR ITS PRIME PROGRAM IN ENTIRETY -- WHEN THE RIVERSIDE PROGRAM OPENED THE MISSION WAS CLEARLY ALL ALIGNED WITH THE MISSION OF PRIME SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED NEEDS OF THE INLAND EMPIRE? AND I THINK THE DECISION AT THAT TIME WAS TO NOT SUSTAIN A SMALL FOR STUDENT PROGRAM TIME THE SCHOOL WAS ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY. SO WE HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT A PRIME PROGRAM INCLUDING AN AREA OF FOCUS AND HOW THAT MIGHT WORK -- I I SPENT A HALF A DAY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WITH THE DEAN AND HER SENIOR TEAM TALKING ABOUT THAT. THERE IS INTEREST IN A POSSIBLE EXPANSION OF PRIME PROGRAM IN CONNECTION WITH THE JOINT MEDICAL PROGRAM -- THEY COULD HAVE SOME EXPANSION AND COULD BE A UNIQUE -- ADDITION SO THIS WOULD BE A TWO YEAR THIS WITH AND FOLLOW -- IF IF THERE WERE THE WISHES AND I THINK THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH COMMISSION WAS A ON ANOTHER AMONG THOSE ENTITIES THAT WANTED TO SEE. SOME CAPABILITY TO GROW BEYOND THE CURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OUR PRIME PROGRAM AND OUR OUR VIEW REALLY WAS. AT THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP LEVEL AND IN OAKLAND AND WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT THAT OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS NEEDED TO SECURE AND NEEDED TO BE TO SECURE AND TO SUSTAIN THE SPOTS. AND THEN TO TAKE A YEAR TO TO SEE WHAT NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND AREAS MAY BE POSSIBLE -- SO THAT COULD THAT COULD BE MET WITH THE YEAR TWO FUNDING REQUEST THAT WE BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN BUT PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON RIVERSIDE DRIVE MEDICAL PROGRAMS SOME INCREMENTAL EXPANSION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONSBECAUSE OF THE NEED IS BEYOND GREAT. AND IT'S BEYOND GREAT UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION REALIZES THAT AND AS THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION -- DID -- WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO AT SOME POINT -- AS THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY END -- BUILD THE BASIC SCIENCE AND AND RESEARCH CAPABILITY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO DEAL WITH THE THE THE THE MEDICAL SCHOOL NEEDS OF OF THAT REGION AND I KNOW. MY COLLEAGUES IS CERTAINLY IN IN THE ASSEMBLY AND NOW IN THE IN THE SENATOR INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THAT AND I DO THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL HAVE. TO EXPLORE A BABY STEPS FIRST AND PERHAPS THE EXPANSION OF THE PRIME PROGRAM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AS IT APPEARS APPROPRIATE -- WOULD BE THE ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS ALONG WITH MAYBE A A BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE PROGRAM AND IN THE UC INSTITUTION UP THERE AS THE AS THE FACILITY IN THE FACULTY CAN PERMIT THAT BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST -- I'M CLEARLY -- INTERESTED IN THIS REQUEST AND CLEARLY INTERESTED IN THE PRIME PROGRAM AND WE WILL. TAKE THAT UP AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT TIME. ANYTHING ELSE ON PRIME -- FINANCE ILIO YOU'LL SPEAK UP IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. OKAY PERFECT CAN I ADD ONE THING -- THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION WHICH IS NOT THE FOCUS OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ISSUED ITS FINAL REPORT -- IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR IT CENTERS ON THE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- MY SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT PAUL CAMAS EXECUTIVE ADVISER FLOYD DEAN WHO IS THE CEO AND PRESIDENT OF COMMON SPIRIT HEALTH NOW PREVIOUSLY DIGNITY ON I'M. THE NEW NAMES ON IT IT'S NOT THAT IS FLUENT YET BUT THIS WAS TWO YEARS OF DELIBERATION INCLUDED HIGHER ED LEADERSHIP FROM THE ISSUE. FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES INCLUDED HEALTH WORKFORCE EXPERTISE. WITH A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCILS -- AT AND WORKING COMMITTEES SUPPLEMENTED WITH A LOT OF EXPERTISE. IN THE TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT COMMISSION -- AND NOTEWORTHY AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY FOR IT WAS SUPPORTED THIS FUNDING REQUEST FOR PRIME JUST. AND THIS COMES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF COMMUNITY LEADERS REGIONALLY WHO HAVE KNOWN THE COME THROUGH TRAINING RETURN TO THESE AREAS -- SO HEART WARMING FOR ME TO SEE THIS IN THE TOP -- TEN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION NOT IN THE TOP -- TEN BUT BUNDLED TOGETHER WERE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF PRIME PROGRAMS AS YOU NOTED THIS MORNING -- SECURING THE SUCCESS OF THE AND LOOKING TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE VALLEY WHICH YOU ALSO JUST MENTIONED SO THAT'S NOTED IN THE COMMISSION -- AND ALSO A TOPIC OF INTEREST RESEARCH AND AND I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE. PRODUCTIVE FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- PSYCHIATRY GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION IN TELEMEDICINE. WHO HAS THAT [inaudible] I GUESS. WATCH TORNADO WATCH TO MY RIGHT. AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU. I DON'T HEAR THAT VERY OFTEN. THAT VERY WELL MAY BE -- REGARDING -- PSYCHIATRY IN TELEMEDICINE -- THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL PHONE ONE TIME -- TO SUPPORTS -- POST GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AT UC RIVERSIDE TO ENSURE THAT -- UNDER SERVED EGIONS OF THE STATE ROLE AREAS WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE -- ADDITIONAL SUPPORTED TOGETHER A HEALTH WERE FORCED TO ADDRESS THOSE -- PLACARD TREE AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. ALL YOU WANT TO WANT TO LEAVE. SO -- I WOULD JUST LIKE -- TO ADD TO THAT AGAIN THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE FUNDING THAT WENT TO UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FOR TELEMEDICINE. WE RECOGNIZE AND OF COURSE HE DID HIS THAT IT WAS SUCH A DIRE NEED. AND AS SUCH ONCE WE RECEIVE THE FUNDING WE WASTED NO TIME TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT -- THE PROPOSAL THAT WE SUBMIT IT. AND I'M PLEASED TO INFORM YOU TODAY THAT AS OF JULY ONE THIS YEAR WE WILL -- HAVE THE ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS TO ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS IN THE PSYCH HI SHERRY. PROGRAM. APRIL OF THIS YEAR -- WE WILL HAVE RESIDENTS WHO WILL BEGAN TO ROTATE AND THE U. C. R. I. PSYCH HI SHAY SWEET FOR TELEMEDICINE. WHERE THOSE RESIDENTS HAVE WILL BE TRAINED AND TELEMEDICINE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ATTENDING PHYSICIANS WE THOUGHT -- INITIATED AN AFFILIATION AGREEMENT WITH EISENHOWER IN RANCHO MOAMMAR MIRAGE. AND THAT WILL LIKELY LEAD TO SOME HELLO PSYCH HI SHERRY IN THE AREA AS WELL. IN OUR PSYCH HIGH SHE SWEET WE HAVE -- A HIGH UP. THAT WE CALL THE TELEMEDICINE HOW ODD AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO OPERATE AND WE ARE PROVIDING CARE TO PLAN A KERR -- STAYS SALUTE DAY -- PLATT BLOW. AND THEY'RE RECEIVING CARE THROUGHS TELL PSYCH HYPHAE ALREADY. WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED IN HEALTH CENTERS. IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY AS WELL AS AN AERIAL COUNTY AND THEY WILL BE RECEIVING TELEMEDICINE. YOU CAN SAY THAT WE WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND BECAUSE WE WASTED NO TIME. AND WE HAVE A TRAINING AFFILIATION THAT'S IN PROGRESS WITH -- SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH INDIAN HEALTH. AGAIN TO PROVIDE -- TELEMEDICINE. WHERE ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS WITH A RIVERSIDE BASE TIME OLIVE CREST WHICH IS A NON PROFIT DEDICATED TO PREVENTING CHALABI'S? AND TREATING ADDRESS. NOT ONLY WILL WE PROVIDE SERVICES ON THE GROUND BUT WE'LL HAVE HELEN PSYCH HI FI SERVICES THERE AS WELL. SO THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN -- GIVEN. I BEANS USED AND USED IN A VERY -- WEISS WAY AND PROVIDING FOR THE NEEDS THAT WE EXPLICITLY DELINEATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU FOR STEPPING OUT SO SMARTLY WITH -- YOUR EFFORTS -- WITH THIS FUNDING IN THE PROGRAMS I MEAN THE I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER NO. A BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- THE THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PARTICULARLY IN THE DESERT AREAS OF IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EASTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN. SAN BERNADINO COUNTY AND CERTAINLY IMPERIAL COUNTY -- IS IS EXTRAORDINARY AND DOES THIS TELL US I CRIED REPROGRAM -- AND MOBILE UNITS AND THE LIKE REALLY. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GAME CHANGER. FOR YOUNG AND OLD TOO BADLY NEED -- THOSE SERVICES IN THOSE AREAS SO SECOND FIRST. THANK YOU FOR STEPPING OUT MA'AM. NO ALL OF JUST -- TO UNDERSCORE OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION THAT. IN ORDER FOR THE RIVERSIDE PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM TO DOUBLE IN SIZE WHICH IS IN AN IMPRESSIVE CHANGE ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. ON WE HAVE NATIONAL CREDITORS THERE WERE NO FIRE A LOT OF EVIDENCE AND SO FOR THIS EXPANSION TO OCCUR -- ALL AND ALONG WITH THAT GROWTH AND PSYCHIATRIC FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS WHICH ARE PLANNED. CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH GERIATRICS -- PSYCHIATRIC HELP THE DESIGNATED SUBSPECIALTIES THE ACGME WHICH ACCREDITS ACCREDITS US RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS. REQUIRES DEMONSTRATION OF CLINICAL NIDA AND SENATOR ROBB YOU SPOKE TO THAT THERE'S HUGE NEED IN THE REGION -- BROADLY ALSO REQUIRE PROOF OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FIND -- RESIDENTS TO PAY SALARIES TO PAY BENEFITS TO SUPPORT FACULTY FOR TEACHING WITHOUT THESE DOLLARS THAT GROWTH -- IN THE SIZE OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH WILL ADD TO NEW PROVIDERS WOULD NOT AT ALL THE POSSIBLE. WELL I I LOOK I KNOW I SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES -- IN SAYING WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COURT -- AND THE OUTCOMES -- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO TO THAT REPORT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SPECTACULAR. ANYTHING FURTHER ON PSYCHIATRY UNTIL PSYCHIATRY JIMMY. OKAY. I THINK DEAN EURON. THANKS TO TALK ABOUT. MY INITIATIVE. FIRST AND FOREMOST UC RIVERSIDE IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHAIRS REQUESTS TO ALLOCATE THAT DISH NO FUNDING TO YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THIS FUNDING WILL POSITION THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO NEARLY DOUBLE ITS CAPACITY FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAL STUDENTS. BY INCREASING THE ONGOING OPERATING REVENUE BY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND PROVIDING EIGHTY MILLION TO HELP THE SCHOOL MAKE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. TO MEET THE CAPACITY DEMANDS THE YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS ESSENTIALLY CAPPED AT SEVEN P. INCOMING MEDICAL STUDENTS EACH YEAR. DUE TO OUR UNDER FUNDED STATUS AND SMALL EDUCATION FACILITY. MOST MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND ROLL MORE THAN A HUNDRED MEDICAL STUDENTS EACH YEAR. THE MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT I CAME FROM AND ROLLED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MEDICAL STUDENTS EVERY. THE YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE NEEDS TO GROW IN ORDER TO MEET THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE THE INLAND EMPIRE. THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES WHICH HAS. THE ADMINISTRATION OVER ALL OF THE US MEDICAL SCHOOLS AS WELL AS CANADIAN MEDICAL SCHOOLS.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE SEEING NONE. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR AN EXCELLENT PANEL PANEL PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. SAFE TRAVELS. WHAT'S THE RETURN TO THE AGENDA ORDER AND IT ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS BUDGET OPERATIONS -- AS WE DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING -- THE COVERS WHICH INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. FOR THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA TWO INTERN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH IS ON GING. ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS ARE FOR CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED COMPENSATION NON SELLER PRICE INCREASES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS. THESE FINDINGS -- THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU SEE TO MAKE TO MAKE DECISIONS -- WITH ITS OTHER FUNDING SOURCES -- HOW TO BEST MEET ITS NEEDS AND AND THE CHIEF STAPLES THANK YOU? I'LL SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AT THAT'S IN THIS ITEM -- REGARDING BUDGET OPERATIONS IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA. BY THAT PROVIDES THE BREAK OUT OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IS THAT A HUNDRED NINETEEN HERE I THINK THAT'S JUST AROUND IN YOUR IN TRMS OF AND IT LOOKING AT THIS TABLE YOU CAN SEE THAT. A MOST OF THE FUNDING IS FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF OUR BASIC COST INCREASES INCURRED BY OF VARIOUS OF BENEFIT COST INCREASES ALSO SOME. EQUIPMENT AND UTILITY COSTS. WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE ONE THING WE WOULD POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE AS YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE SALARY INCREASES FOR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. THAT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND IN THE UNIVERSITY EVER INDICATES THAT THIS IS A MIX OF SOME CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN. NEGOTIATED AND SOME CONTRACTS ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION SO THIS IS AN ESTIMATE AND IN SOME CASES -- WHAT YOU DON'T SEE HERE OUR SALARY INCREASES FOR NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND FOR CONTEXT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF CORE FUNDED EMPLOYEES THAT YOU SEE ARE? NOT REPRESENTED AND THAT INCLUDES ALL LATTER RAIN COULD FACULTY THE TEN YEAR AND TENURE TRACK. AND MANY ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRATION UC HAS IDENTIFIED SOME NON STATE RESOURCES THAT IT COULD BE USED TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION INCREASES AS IF IT WOULD LIKE -- BUT THEY AREN'T EXPLICITLY INCLUDING THAT IN THERE AND IT'S IN THEIR BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL -- WE RECOMMEND YOU THINK ABOUT IT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ISSUES ON THE MOTHER NOT THE UNIVERSITY IS IS COMPETITIVE AND ATTRACTING EMPLOYEES AND BASED ON THE DATA YOU MIGHT. AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH OR THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND AND FIND DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE GROUPS ARE FUN MORE EMPLOYEE GROUPS -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY ARE NO LONGER. COLLECTS -- A LOT OF THE RECORD TENSION DATA CENTRALLY AND SO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A LOT OF THAT DATA UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE SOME DATA ON SALARY COMPARISON SO FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT. YOU SEE FACULTY SALARIES ARE -- HIGHER ON AVERAGE THAN OTHER PUBLIC HIGH RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST THAT THEIR SALARIES MIGHT BE. SOMEWHAT COMPETITIVE BUT WITHOUT MORE FURTHER IN FROM DATA ON HOW WELL THE RECRUITING FACULTY HOW ALL THE RETAINING THEM. WE CAN'T UP OUR OFFICE CAN PROVIDE FURTHER ANALYSIS ON THAT THANK YOU. MORNING YOU SEE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR ROTH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I AM SAY OF IT THEN I'LL BE SPEAKING FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TODAY -- I'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS -- QUITE A STICK COLORFUL DAK AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE ARE EXTRAS HERE ON THE ON THIS STAND OVER HERE -- LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO SKIP OVER SOME OF THE OVERVIEW BUT ON SLIDE. TO SEE IF SOME BASICS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE TEN CAMPUS SYSTEM WITH TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF REGENTS AND A SYSTEM WIDE PRESIDENT -- AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR ACADEMIC SENATE MAKING WITH THE OF ACADEMIC POLICIES FOR THE UNIVERSITY. ON SLIDE THREE YOU'LL SEE THE YOU'LL SEE THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY WE ARE DRIVEN BY QUALITY ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES BASED ON WHICH THE UNIVERSITY. SEEKS TO MAKE OFF OF DECISIONS TO ENROLL AND OUR POLICIES TO GET STUDENTS THROUGH OUR SYSTEM -- ON SLIDE. FOR YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY'S IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE FOR YOU. IS THAT OUR FACULTY BRING IN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AN EXTERNAL GRANTS FOR BILLION OF THESE COME FROM OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. THAT OUR FACULTY BRING IN AND THAT'S TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY IS NEAR THE UC CAMPUSES. AND ALSO OUR FACULTIES INNOVATIONS AND PATENTS GO INTO THE COMMUNITY AND HELP OUR CREATE COMPANIES AND CREATE ADDITIONAL JOB GROWTH JUST BEYOND THE UNIVERSITY. SO WE ARE A BIG A DRIVER OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY ON OUR OWN FOR THOSE THE NON STATE FUNDS THAT -- ARE USED TO DEAL WITH SALARIES. FOR TENURE TRACK CONTINUED FACULTY. A TENURE TRACK FACULTY SALARIES COME LARGELY FROM STATE GENERAL FUND BUT ARE THE GRANT FUNDING ENDS UP PAYING FOR THEIR RESEARCH AND UP SUPPORTING GRADUATE STUDENTS AND ENDS UP SUPPORTING POSTDOCS AND OUR LABS. AND ALSO SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT'S STAFF WHO HELPED THE FACULTY IN APPLYING FOR GRANTS. AND MANAGING THE FUNDS RELATED TO THOSE. ON SLIDE FIVE YOU SEE THE TOTAL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUDGET -- UC'S BUDGET THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS WONDERED IF THIS IS FOR OUR MEDICAL CENTERS WHICH WE WON'T BE DISCUSSING DOC MUCH TODAY WE ARE WE'VE ALREADY HAD THAT DISCUSSION WITH THE PANELISTS WHO LEFT -- ANOTHER FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION AS FOR THOSE CONTRACTS AND GRANTS FOR THE RESEARCH. AND THEN ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION IS FOR OUR AXILLARIS THESE ARE OUR SALES AND SERVICES WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE DORMITORIES THE PARKING TO FOOD SERVICES. ON OUR CAMPUSES AND TODAY OUR CONVERSATION WILL FOCUS ON WHAT WE CALL OUR CORE FUNDS. AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE TO SEE WHAT THOSE CORE FUNDS ARE MADE UP OF IT'S ABOUT NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. OF ABOUT 40% OF THAT IS STATE FUNDING -- ANOTHER THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION IF COMES FROM STUDENT TUITION AND FEES. WE GET ALMOST ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID BY OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. AND ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM A MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES INCLUDING PATENT REVENUE -- SOME CHARGES ON THE FEDERAL CONTRACTS AND GRANTS THAT GETS FUNNELED BACK FOR CAMPUS SERVICES. THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT PIECE WAS ONE POINT ONE POINT THREE BILLION [inaudible] YEAH. AND THEN WE'LL BE COVERING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STUDENT FEES LATER ALL ALSO GOING TO TALK MORE DETAIL -- YOU C. O. P. BUDGET IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION OUT OF THAT A NINE POINT THREE BILLION. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LARGE CHUNK OUT OF THE ONE NINE POINT THREE THAT IS NOT REALLY USABLE FOR THE CAMPUSES. THE UC PAYS OUT OF OUR OWN BUDGET WE PAY GEO FONT DEBT SERVICE AND WE CAN'T REDIRECT THAT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WE ALSO -- PROVIDE FUNDING FOR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. OF AND WE HAVE ANOTHER LARGE COMPONENT THAT GOES TO OUR YOU SEE RETIREMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR SELF CONTAINED RETIREMENT PROGRAM FOR ALL YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. AND THOSE THREE COMPONENTS TOGETHER TAKE UP ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THAT CORE FUNDS PIE. FOR USE ON UP ACTUAL CAMPUS OPERATIONS. ALL RIGHT SO. I'D LIKE TO REVIEW ON SLIDE SIX WITH YOU. CAN YOU MEET. THANKS FOR TOMORROW AS WELL YES SIR JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING HERE RIGHT RIGHT I NOTICED THAT -- WE HAVE SOME MINIMUM INFORMATION THE CONCERNS ME YOU SEE HAS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY BILLION UNFUNDED PENSION RETIREE HEALTH -- LIABILITY SO IS THEIR WAY -- YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THAT. WORKING TOWARDS THAT. YES SIR YOUR CORRECT WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AT THE MOMENT TEN BILLION OF THAT IS FOR TO TRADITIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY CHARGING OF THE 6% OF ALL SALARIES OF FROM THE CAMPUSES AND THAT 6% CHARGE IS PLACED INTO THE USE THE R. P.. TOWARD THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN ORDER -- TO BUILD IT BUILD IT UP -- WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON THAT WE'RE NOW IT'S 85% FUNDED SO WE STILL HAVE THAT TEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP WITH WHERE WE'RE DOING FAIRLY WELL. 85% FUNDED -- WE THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE FORMED A WORKING GROUP -- INTERNALLY TO ADDRESS THE YOU SEE -- THE MEDICAL A RETIREMENT COMPONENT OF STOCK WHICH IS ABOUT NINETEEN BILLION AT THIS TIME -- WE WE HAVE NOT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SAVINGS SET ASIDE TO PAY FOR RETIREE HEALTH WE PAY FOR RETIREE HEALTH KIND OF ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS -- HOWEVER WE ARE FACING THE PASTA THE THE UPCOMING RETIREMENT OF A LOT OF BABY BOOMERS. WHO WILL BE RETIRING AND THEN COLLECTING -- MEDICAL CARE FROM THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY SO. IT'LL TAKE YOU TO GET CAUGHT UP. I DO NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME I WILL GET THAT FOR YOU -- THE WORKING GROUP AS FAR AS I KNOW IS STILL DEBATING OPTIONS. OPTIONS TO CHANGE. THE MEDICAL BENEFIT PROGRAM FOR A PAY AS YOU GO TO SOMETHING ELSE. OUR E. BUT TOOK TO CREATE SOME KIND OF SAVINGS SO THAT WE WE HAVE A QUESTION AS AS EMPLOYEES RETIRED THAT WE WE DON'T SEE A RAPID INCREASE IN THE PAY AS YOU GO. LOOK YOU'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. YES WHAT WHAT WE'RE ON PENSIONS MAY I MAKE A COMMENT. WE'LL KEEP WILL KEEP YOU ON THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER -- SO I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOUR OH THREE B. PLAN WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A FOUR OH ONE K. PLAN. THAT YOU'RE OFFERING TO NEW EMPLOYEES -- I REMAIN CONCERNED FOR TWO REASONS. ONE IS A FOUR OH THREE B. OR FOUR ONE K. PLAN PUTS ALL THE RISK ON THE FUTURE RETIREE BECAUSE IT'S DEPENDENT UPON THE STOCK MARKET. AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS WHEN YOU HAVE NEW PEOPLE COMING IN AND THEY DO NOT THEY ARE PART OF A DEFINED BENEFIT CONTRIBUTION. IT HARMS THOSE THAT ARE IN THE CONTRIBUTION. BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEW REVENUE BEING GENERATED AND AND BEING PUT INTO THAT FUND. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A CHOICE BUT I JUST WORRY THAT THE UC IS TRYING TO PHASE OUT THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. AND WORK MORE WITH A FOUR OH THREE B. R. FOUR ONE K. PLAN. YES SENATOR I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS -- CURRENTLY EMPLOYEES IF THEY DO NOT MAKE A SELECTION TO A DEFAULT THE TRADITIONAL PLAN. OF ALSO WE ARE CHARGING ALL OUR CAMPUSES THAT 6% OF EXTRA FEE ON ALSO THOSE EMPLOYEE WHO GO INTO THE FOR ONE CASE STYLE PLAN. THAT GETS PUT INTO TO A TRADITIONAL. TO THE DOOR I'M BENEFIT TO THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. TO KEEP THAT PLAN HEALTHY AND MAKE UP THAT SHORTFALL IN FUNDING THERE CURRENTLY OKAY THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THANK YOU Q.. SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION BUT THAT IT'S GOOD DAY SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS WHILE WE'RE ON THE PARTICULAR SUBJECT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MY AGE YOU FORGET YOUR QUESTIONS SO. PLEASE ASK AT ANY POINT MY PRESENTATION IS QUITE LONG AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO GO THROUGH IT PRETTY FAST TO KEEP US MOVING -- SO AS NOT TO KEEP YOU HERE ALL pDAY BUT PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME -- IS WHERE I SHOW THE R. REGIONS HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING A NEW BROAD FRAMEWORK OF OF A VISION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND THE EMPHASIS OF THIS MISSION IS TO MOVE AWAY FROM A YEAR TO YOUR ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT TO OUTCOMES BASED APPROACH. UP AND AT THE HEART OF THIS VISION IS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND ENSURING THAT YOU SEE BOTH MAINTAINS ACCESS. AND PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THIS VERSION INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FACULTY WHO MENTOR TO NEXT GENERATION OF THOUGHT LEADERS. AND GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA THROUGH THEIR INVENTIONS AND THE GRANTS THEY BRING TO THE STATE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THE REGION'S MULTI YEAR PLAN WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT MODESTLY. AND PRIMARILY FOCUS ON CLOSING-GRADUATION GAPS SHORTENING TIME TO DEGREE AND BRING IN THOSE WHO LEFT WITHOUT A DEGREE BACK FOR COMPLETION. YOU'LL SEE THEM THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN THERE. AND THEN NEXT -- I THINK FINANCE COVERED SLIDE SEVEN OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO COVER ON SLIDE SEVEN QUITE WELL BUT JUST TO MENTION THAT THE CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR STANTON BUDGET PROVIDES YOU SEE WITH A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED FORTY IS ONGOING. AND ON SLIDE EIGHT YOU'LL SEE THE ONE TIME LATER ON THAT COVERS BOTH OF THESE SO I WANT WELL ON THEM BUT IT'S THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THE DEGREE COMPLETION OF ARTS FUNDING IS ONE TIME. ON SLIDE NINE IS WHERE I START DISCUSSING. THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET REQUEST IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR STANTON BUDGET. OF WE ARE REQUESTING A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANTAN BUDGET. AND I'VE TRIED TO BREAK THESE DOWN HERE FOR YOU FOR TH INTO. THREE MAIN CATEGORIES ONE OF THESE IS A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CURRENT HERE. THAT A GO AWAY ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR THAT WE'RE REQUESTING BE MADE PERMANENT. BOB AND THE REASON WE WE WANT THESE FUNDS PERMANENTLY AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING STUDENTS AND WE RECEIVED THEM IN LIEU OF A TUITION BY OUT AND I'LL GO INTO THAT MORE A LITTLE BIT LATER. WE ALSO HAVE A REQUEST ON RELATED TO ENROLLMENT AND GROWING ACCESS. AND ALSO FOR OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY DEBT SERVICE FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED FOR WHICH THAT THAT SERVICE IS NOW COMING. TO A HEAD AND I STILL RECALL WE PAY FOR THAT SERVICE OUT OF OUR OWN BUDGET. OUT OF OUR OWN OPERATING BUDGET. ON SLIDE TEN I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS UP WE'VE GOT AS ONE TIME MONEY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. LAST LAST YEAR DURING DEBATES ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. VOTED TO GIVE THESE FUNDS TO THE UNIVERSITY PERMANENTLY SEEING THAT THERE WAS A DEFINITE NEED FOR THEM IT WAS DURING THE LAST PHASES OF THE BUDGET. NEGOTIATION PROCESS THAT SOME TO PROVIDED THAT THE UNIVERSITY AS ONE TIME. BUT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THEIR SUPPORTING TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNDERGRADUATES CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE HERE CURRENTLY AND WHO HAVE NOT YET GRADUATED THESE CONTINUE TO NEED OUR SUPPORT. THEY CONTINUE TO NEED US -- TO PROVIDE THEM WITH COURSES STUDENT SERVICES AND ACADEMIC ADVISING. ALSO WERE PART OF HIS NINETY FIVE MILLION WAS A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR -- IN LIEU OF IN LIEU OF A TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BEING CREASE WE RECEIVED SOME STATE FUNDING. AND IF WE HAD HAD A TUITION INCREASE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING FUND SOURCE. THIS WASINTENDED TO ALSO BE AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE UT IT WAS MADE ONE TIME SO WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THOSE FUNDS BE MADE PERMANENT. I WANTED TO GET THE HELL OVER THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDERGRADUATE SUPPORTED NOW I MEAN WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM. WELL IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE RECEIVED ONE COMPANY I KNOW YEAH. AND MURDER THAT. BECAUSE THEY WERE -- IT WAS AN OVER AND ROLL IT WASN'T IT WASN'T OVER INVOLVEMENT YES THAT TOOK PLACE IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO THAT. THE CHANCELLORS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES JUST SORT OF TAKE IT OUT OF HIDE TO COVER THE COST OF THE EDUCATION UNTIL WE GOT THE ONE TIME FUNDS YES. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT WE USE THE ONE TIME FUNDS -- TO HIRE OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION HAS TO OFFER COURSES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND IF THOSE FUNDS GO AWAY -- LECTURES ARE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES WE'D LIKE TO RETAIN THEM THEY'RE VERY GOOD QUALITY INSTRUCTORS. OF AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THE STUDENT COURSES BUT IF WE DON'T GET THE FUNDING. ONGOING -- THE CAMPUSES WILL HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND DECISIONS THAT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION FOR THE STUDENTS PRIMARILY IN THAT CLASSES WILL BE LARGER IN SIZE OR STUDENTS CAN'T GET INTO A CLASS THEY MIGHT NEED FOR THEIR MAJOR. WHERE THE -- WERE THE OVER ENROLLED STUDENTS DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE CAMPUS NO -- I DO NOT HAVE THE LIST RIGHT THAT'S FINE YES I WILL SEND THAT TO YOUR STAFF WAS JUST CURIOUS. THEY ARE THEY ARE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM A LARGE CHUNK OF THE MARKET -- MINE YES -- SO AND OTHER THINGS THAT WERE DONE WITH THESE FUNDS WERE THAT UC RIVERSIDE HIGHER FOURTEEN NEW LOTTERING FACULTY LETTERING FACULTY. OF WE ARE PART WITH US PERMANENTLY SO IF THEY DO NOT RECEIVE ONGOING FUN STILL HAVE TO MAKE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN THEIR BUDGET. WHICH WOULD -- INVOLVE STAFF WHO ARE WHO DON'T HAVE SECURITY OF EMPLOYMENT -- ON SLIDE ELEVEN I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE ON AND I DO WANT TO ALSO MENTION THAT OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE NINETY FIVE MILLION. WAS SPENT ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS THANK YOU. UP ON SLIDE. ELEVEN I YOU SEE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS YOU MANDATORY COSTS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. OF THIS THE THE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER AND THIS IS ONLY TO MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS SO THESE ARE INCREASES TO THE RETIREMENT INCREASES TO OUR LABOR CONTRACTS AND INCREASES TO THE HEALTH BENEFITS -- NOW WHILE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A LARGE INCREASE FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES -- PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS INCREASE IS ON THE U. SEES A THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS STATE GENERAL FUND BUDGET AND DOC REPRESENTS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT IN KEEPING WITH A COLA -- AND IF WE DON'T RECEIVE THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME THAT I JUST DISCUSSED -- THAT WILL EAT INTO THESE FUNDS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. FOR US. IN THE IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE NEW FUNDING SO WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S NECESSARY AT THE NINETY FIVE MILLION MUST BE COVERED FIRST AND THEN THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED FOR US. FOR A NEW AND EXPANDED USES. OF OTHER HIGH PRIORITY COST THAT YOU SEE THERE INCLUDE FACULTY COMPENSATION STAFF COMPENSATION AND CAPITAL OUTLAY DEBT SERVICE. I'M GOING TO DISCUSS CAPITAL OUTLAY LATER IN THE AGENDA BUT FOR STAFF COMPENSATION THE PROPOSAL IS FOR FORTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION IS A 3% INCREASE IN SALARY FOR NON REPRESENTED STAFF. FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS YOU SEE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE SALARY PROGRAM TO INCREASE NON REPRESENTED STAFF SALARIES -- AND IN THE PAST TEN YEARS OUR AVERAGE ANNUAL BUDGET INCREASE FOR STAFF SALARIES WAS ONE POINT COMPARED TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES WHICH ARE GETTING ABOUT YOU KNOW BETWEEN TWO AND 5%. WE'RE A LITTLE BIT LESS -- ON FACULTY COMPENSATION COMPONENT IS A NINETY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND INCLUDES THREE PARTS -- THESE COMPONENTS ARE THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FACULTY MERITS. FACULTY MERITS AS THE PROGRAM WHERE AN ASSOCIATE -- ASSISTANT PROFESSOR BECOMES AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR BECOMES A FULL PROFESSOR. IT'S A REVIEW THAT EACH FACULTY MEMBER GETS EVERY THREE YEARS AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE UP EITHER IN PAY OR THE JUMP -- IN TITLE. OF WE WERE SUED IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT -- IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT RULED AGAINST YOU SEE IN THE CASE CALLED ANDERSON VERSUS REGIONS. OF THAT STATED THAT WE CANNOT SKIP PROVIDING FACULTY MERITS IN ANY YEAR OF DUE TO BUDGETARY REASONS -- AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE'VE YOU FACULTY MERITS AS A MANDATORY COST IF WE WILL COVER IN SOME MANNER SO THAT'S THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE TO COVER FOR THAT. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE FACULTY COMPENSATION PIECES FORTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION TO FUNDAN AVERAGE FACULTY SALARY INCREASE OF 3% OF OUR FACULTY. AND THEN WE HAVE A FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLAR SEPARATE SALARY PROGRAM AS PART OF A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO TRY AND CLOSE OUR FACULTY SALARY CAPS. WITH OUR COMPARISON INSTITUTES -- ON THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE OF TWELVE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FACULTY SALARIES OF MAY ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THESE POINTS -- WE HAVE FOUND THAT FIFTEEN OUT OF THE TOP TWENTY INSTITUTIONS THE QC LOSES FACULTY TO WHEN WE HAVE FACULTY LEAVE US FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. WE LOSE TEM TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS NOT THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS -- AND IN OUR COMPARISON INSTITUTES OF WERE SELECTED AFTER EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION WITH -- THIS IS YEARS AND YEARS AGO BACK IN EIGHTIES OR NINETIES. WITH OF LA -- AND THE NOW DEFUNCT C. PACK SELECTED OUR COMPARISON INSTITUTES SO THIS WASN'T THAT WE WERE CHERRY PICKING WHO WE FELT THAT YOU KNOW. WE WE FELT. WE WERE LIKE -- IN OUR COMPARISON INSTITUTES ARE LISTED THERE. ARE STILL RELEVANT. YES I DO YES I DO BECAUSE THE WE COMPARE OURSELVES TO TOP PUBLICS WHO THAT PUB HAVE -- COMPETITIVE RESEARCH THAT ALSO PULL IN A LOT OF FEDERAL GRANTS AND WE COMPARE OURSELVES -- TO EXCELLENT PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE WE STRIVE TO BE LIKE. AND SIX OF THE UCS ARE NOW IN THE TOP TEN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY. WHICH GIVES SUPPORT TO YOU THE CONTINUED USE OF YOUR LIST I SUPPOSE YES -- SO WE HAD WE HAD A SURVEY OUR OUR FACULTY -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FOUND THAT SALARY WAS MOVED THE MOST OFTEN CITED REASON WHY OUR FACULTY LEFT FOR OTHER UNIVERSITIES. AND WE ARE STILL SIX POINT 7% BELOW ARE COMPARISON INSTITUTES AVERAGE AVERAGE OF THOSE EIGHT COMPARISON INSTITUTE DID YOU SEE LIST THAT THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. OF THE SLIDE. TWELVE ALL RIGHT IN THAT CONCLUDES THE OPERATIONAL COMPONENT OF MY DISCUSSION THE NEXT DISCUSSION IS -- ON RESIDENT AND NONRESIDENT ROLE MENTAL PAUSE HERE FOR QUESTIONS OR SEE. YEAH SURVEYS OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS WEK OUT THOUSANDS OF UC EMPLOYEES -- INCLUDING HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE ON STRIKE FOR WAGE IMPROVE WAGES AND BENEFITS. HOW YOU ALIGN STRONG REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDING A 7% INCREASE IN HOSPITAL REVENUES AND OVERALL SYSTEM FUNDING INCREASE? TO SUPPORT THESE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. THE INCREASE IN OF REPRESENT EMPLOYEE SALARY WOULD BE PROVIDED -- THE FUNDING SOURCE AT THEIR BASE SALARIES CURRENTLY -- FUNDED OUT OF WE HAVE AS PART OF OUR OPERATIONAL REQUESTS. AN AVERAGE OF THREE POINT 6% INCREASE. TO ARE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES' SALARIES -- THAT [inaudible] WE ARE. THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WHICH EACH OF UNION AND AS YOU KNOW WE ARE IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH TWO OF OUR UNIONS CURRENTLY. OF AND HAVE MADE AN OFFER AND HAVE A STATE APPOINTED MEDIATOR FOR THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND WE ARE HOPING THAT -- THEY WILL RETURN TO THE BARGAINING TABLE AND MOVED TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WITH US SO WE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM A CONTRACT THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES DESERVE SO THEY CAN BE PAID. HIGHER WAGES BECAUSE COSTS IN THE STATE ARE GOING UP AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PAY THE MAHR. I THINK THAT THAT THAT SOUNDS GOOD -- BUT I WOULD ALSO THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE -- TO TO SUPPORT GOVERNORS PRIOR -- PROPOSAL TO PRIMARY PREY TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES I THINK HE IS SET TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. AND I HOPE THAT THE UC COME FIND A RESOLUTION -- QUICKLY UNDERSTAND THE SAY THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE BUT CLEARLY IF THEY'RE ON STRIKE IT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE THINKING THEY DESERVE. SO. AS SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED FOR AS IN THE MIDDLE AND I I HOPE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT I URGE THE SHEET THAT YOU SEE AND MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. THANK YOU SENATOR AND WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS. ISSUE TO RESIDENT AND NONRESIDENT ROLAND IS THAT WE'RE DOING [inaudible] OKAY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT ROMAN GROWTH CURRENTLY PAID FOR BY ONE TIME FUNDS IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AS WE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PER OF FUNDS THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF THE USES WHEN A REQUEST FUNDING ARE ALREADY NEGOTIATED SALARY INCREASES WHICH WE JUST DISCUSSED. ENSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE FED AND HOUSED IN PROVIDING NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. SO THERE ARE. THREE ISSUES BEFORE YOU WHEN THIS ITEM THE FIRST IS A RESIDENT ROMAN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE SECOND IS RESIDENT ROLE MEANT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND IN FUTURE YEARS. ON THE THIRD ISSUE IS NON RESIDENT ROMANCE ALL TOUCH ON EACH ISSUE. WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST ISSUE ENROLLMENT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON YOUR AGENDA PROVIDES A PRETTY LENGTHY ANALYSIS OF OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT YEAR AND IT'S A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BACKSTORY BUT EFFECTIVELY WHAT HAPPENED IS THE STATE SAID IN A MORE PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING. AND AN INTENT LANGUAGE STATED THAT ONE OF THE PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS TO GROW MORE RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES. WITH A REAL RESIDENT AND WRENCHED UNDERGRADUATE ALONG AND BEYOND THAT TARGET. THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT IN PROVIDING THOSE FUNDS THE BUDGET DIDN'T SET AT THE EXPLICIT TARGET AND HOW MANY STUDENTS THAT. INITIAL TARGET. AND IT DIDN'T CLARIFY HOW YOU SEE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THAT ENROLLMENT -- AND AND LATER YEARS BECAUSE IT WAS ONETIME FUNDING. YOU SEE CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THAT IT AND ROLLED ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS THAN WHAT WAS EXPLICITLY BUDGETED AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO SUPPORT A THOUSAND STUDENTS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ABOUT. LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE OVER BUDGET OF THE OVER BUDGET STUDENTS. AND GIVEN THE AMBIGUITIES IN THIS LANGUAGE WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ONE REASONABLE APPROACH -- BUT ULTIMATELY WITH A QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE IS WHAT DID THE LEGISLATURE INTEND WHEN IT -- PROVIDED THESE ONE TIME FUNDS. WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND ISSUE ENROLLMENT IN LATER YEARS. WHAT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNORS IN PROPOSING? AN ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY OR EVER EVER LATER YEARS. AND ISN'T OUT ISN'T -- APPROPRIATING ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING ABOVE THAT TEN MILLION FOR A MOMENT IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECOMMEND AS WE DO EVERY YEAR THAT YOU SAID IN A ROMAN TARGET FOR YOU SEE AND CLARIFIED THAT INSURES THAT YOU SEE IS MEETING YOUR MOMENT THEIR LEGISLATURES IN ROMANS EXPECTATIONS. ONE THING WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS INSTEAD OF SITTING AT FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE RECOMMEND YOU SET THAT TARGET. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE REASONING FOR THAT IS THAT BY THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE NEXT THE BUDGET YOU SEE WILL HAVE MADE ITS ADMISSION DECISIONS. FOR FALL TWENTY NINETEEN SETTLED WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE AND AS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET FOR THAT AND IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL IF FOR THAT TARGET BE GROWTH. MARINE FLAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD THAT TARGET THE AND WE OFFER SOME FACTORS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER A MEASURE AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND WEIGHING THIS AGAINST. YOUR OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES FOR THE SYSTEM. ON THE ONE HAND THE UNIVERSITY. IS -- IN A DRAWING FROM IT LIKELY DRAWING FROM BEYOND ITS FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY. FOR AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE SO MUCH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS NOT THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A LOWER PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE OTHER HAND MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE NOT ACCOMMODATED TO THEIR CAMPUS OF CHOICE AND ARE REDIRECTED TO MERCED AND AND MOST STUDENTS ARE RE REFERRED TO MERCED ON DON'T TAKE UP THE ADDITION OFFER DON'T ENROLL IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IT COULD STILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST ISSUE THE THIRD ISSUE NONRESIDENT ROMANCE JUST A NOTE HERE -- WE'D WRITTEN IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT USE HE'S PLANNING TO ENROLL ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MORE RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ON THE ONE AREA OF UNCERTAINTY HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. REQUESTED THAT -- YOU SEEK TO DEVELOP A REPORT AND SUBMIT TO IT AND IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. A PLAN TO REDUCE NONRESIDENT ROMAN BY YOU SEE TO UNDERTAKE THAT PLAN OBVIOUSLY THE EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS MIGHT NOT. IN THAT GROWTH MIGHT NOT IT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN TWENTY DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE -- INTENDS FOR USING A KERRY FOR KERRY OUT OF THAT PLAN THANK YOU. DID YOU SAY THAT THE YOU SEE HEAD. EXPECTS THERE HAS NINETEEN HUNDRED MORE F. T. STUDENTS AND THEN WE BUDGETED FOR THAT'S RIGHT IT THEY'RE THEY'RE ANTICIPATING -- ENROLLMENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GREW BY ABOUT THIRTY NINE HUNDRED RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES AND WE HAD EXPLICITLY BUDGETED FOR TWO THOUSAND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THAT ADDITIONAL NINETEEN HUNDRED GRAND AND IN THIS BUDGET WE'RE FUNDING HOW MANY OF THOSE. NINETEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WHY WOULDN'T WE FUND. NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY. IS WE HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE IS AT THE UNIVERSITY INDICATED -- IN ITS REQUEST THAT IT HAD A ONE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLED AND THAT WAS. THE TARGET THAT IS IT SET FOR ITSELF. THERE ARE OTHER MULTIPLE REVENUE SOURCES FOR UNIVERSITIES COVER THIS OVER ROMAN -- SO WE DECIDED TO FIND THE THE TARGET. IS WHAT WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE UC. THANK YOU -- ON SLIDE THIRTEEN OF MY PRESENTATION I HAVE A SUMMARY OF OUR ENROLLMENT FUNDING REQUESTS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL -- AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS. WE ARE SEEKING TO GROW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT FOR NEXT YEAR -- BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADS AND BY A THOUSAND NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS AND THIS WOULD COST A TOTAL OF FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE REST OF OUR FUNDING REQUEST IS RELATED TO EXISTING -- ENROLLMENT THAT WE HAVE TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR WE OFTEN REFERRED TO THIS AS OVER ENROLLMENT -- STUDENTS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO STATE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION RESEARCH RECEIVED CURRENTLY -- SO IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE OVER AND ROLLED BY NEARLY NINETEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS AS YOU HEARD WE WERE. WAS FUNDING IDENTIFIED FOR TWO THOUSAND OF FIVE MILLION WHICH CAME FROM THE STATE AND FIFTEEN MILLION CAME FROM YOU CEASE INTERNAL RESOURCES. AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER NINETEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO ARRIVED -- SOME OF THE REASONS WE ENDED UP OVER AND ROLLING IS THAT -- ADMISSIONS IS VERY MUCH OF AN ART MORE THAN NECESSARILY A SCIENCE THIS IS LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT OFF. WILL CREATE THIS KIND OF A LARGE SWING -- THOUGH A THOUSAND OF THE STUDENTS WERE IN SAN DIEGO WHERE -- I'D LOCAL DECISION WAS MADE TO MAKE MORE OFFERS TO LOCAL STUDENTS AND HIGH SCHOOLS WHO HAD EXCELLED -- AND THOSE STUDENTS TOOK UP THOSE OFFERS IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING. TO ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED WORDS LA WHO ARE NOT ANTICIPATING -- LARGE JUMP IN THERE -- IN THEIR ACCEPTANCE AS BUT THEY HAD MOVED UP IN RANKINGS -- FROM SECOND OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITY THE FIRST PUBLIC AND I CREATED A LITTLE -- ADDITIONAL BUMP FOR THEM SO. WE HAVE THESE NINETEEN HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS THAT WE WERE NOT NECESSARILY ANTICIPATING AND WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY ONE POINT% NINE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE THEM WITH -- INSTRUCTION COURSES SUPPORT SERVICES. AND SO FORTH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT OUR EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PRIME REQUEST SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT. A VERY MUCH NEEDED FUNDING. OF AND WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS PART OF THE PRIOR ITEM. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OVER ENROLLMENT FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US ONE TIME FUNDING. SO ALL TOGETHER THESE REQUESTS ARE -- ARE QUITE LARGE. UP ON THE NEXT SLIDE I PROVIDE A REPRESENTATION ON SLIDE -- FOURTEEN OF HOW QUICKLY OUR RESIDENT ENROLLMENT HAS GROWN. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. OF AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION WE SLOW DOWN OUR RESIDENT ENROLLMENT -- THEN WE RECEIVED A LOUD AND CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT WAS VERY MUCH WANTED AT THE YOU SEE AND YOU WANTEDUS TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS. AND WE WENT FOR IT AND WE HAVE -- AND ROLLED. UP WELL OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND NEW NEW FTE STUDENTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. OFBUT WHAT THIS DOES FOR OUR CAMPUSES THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL NEED ON FINANCIAL AID NOT JUST ON THE FINANCIAL AID DOLLARS BUT ON THE ADVISING. OF THERE'S A NEED FOR NEW SERVICES WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR APPOINTMENTS. OF THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO IS SUFFERING. OF AND WE HAVE -- WE'RE HEARING FROM STUDENTS THAT THE CLASSROOM CONDITIONS ARE NOT WHAT THEY WOULD ANTICIPATE IN A TOP UNIVERSITY. AND WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ON THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIFTEEN IS WHERE I GO INTO WHERE WAS THIS UNFUNDED AND ROMAN I REALLY TRY TO ILLUSTRATE A BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU. YOU SEE A CHART THERE ON THE PAGE WITH THE YEAR IN THE FAR LEFT. OF AND THEN OUR TOTAL CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE THIS OUR RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT THERE. AND THE GROWTH AND DECLINE THAT OCCURRED EACH YEAR -- AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF WENT DOWN 414-152-1516 AND THEN BEGAN A RAPID GROWTH UP. OF THE BUDGET ACT MANDATED CERTAIN GROSS FROM THE UC -- FOR WHICH I FUNDING WAS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE BUDGET ACT ARE NOT ALWAYS AT THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION SOMETIMES LESS BUT IT WAS IDENTIFIED AND THAT WAS OUR AGREEMENT. OF AND THEN THE UNFUNDED GROWTH IS THERE ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE CHART YOU'LL SEE WE'VE OVER AND ROLLED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS. FOR WHOM WE ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY STATE FUNDING. I WAS AT AN INTENTIONAL. OVER IN ROMAN OR WAS IT THE RESULTS OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU JUST INDICATED WHERE WHERE PEOPLE. ACCEPTED MISSION OFFERS THEM PROGRAMMED. IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL IT WAS -- IT WAS VERY MUCH ACCIDENTAL SO IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE BUDGET ACT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SAID THAT UNLESS WE ENROLLED THOSE FIVE THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS WE WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY. FUNDING FOR ANY OF THE NEW ENROLLMENT. SO THERE WAS A LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM YOU CYCLE GO BIG. IN ROLLED A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WE'RE WE'RE CERTAIN TO MAKE OUR MAKE A FEW MORE OFFERS SO WE TURN TO GET ALL THE STUDENTS WE NEED -- AND WE PUSH THEM A LITTLE TOO HARD THE PERSON VERY VERY MUCH TO HEART WE OVER INVOLVED BY A LOT OF STUDENTS. A AND THEN THE LANGUAGE WAS REMOVED OUT OF THIS CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ACT CURRENT YOUR BUDGET ACTS OF HAD MORE FOR GIVEN LANGUAGE THAT SAID IF WE DON'T ENROLL THE STUDENTS THEN WE'LL LOOSE. A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF STATE MONEY WILL LIKE THAT WE APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU TO YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. FOR HELPING TO WRITE THAT -- AND BUT WE HAD WE STILL END UP OVER AND ROLLING BECAUSE OF THESE ISSUES. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT ACCESS WE'RE ALL ABOUT AXIS BUT WE'RE ALSO ABOUT QUALITY AND WE PROMISE TO STUDENTS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THE CLASSES ONCE THEY'RE IN THE UNIVERSITY? AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HIRE MORE MORE INSTRUCTOR SUPPORTED HIM AND I'M I'M SURE FINANCE WOULD SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE NEED BUDGET INTEGRITY TO SO. THAT'S WHY I ASK MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL ACT. WHICH IS. THIS SORT OF HAPPENSTANCE BUT WE STILL NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WE ARE. NOW IN THE PROCESS USE YOUR P. IS HELPING THE CAMPUSES EVALUATE THEIR FORMULAS. FOR HOW THEY HOW THEY MAKE OFFERS BECAUSE THIS LAST OF FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE DID NOT NEED TO GO. ON OUR WAITLIST ALMOST AT ALL. MOST CAMPUSES NEVER WENT ON THE WAIT LIST AND YET THERE ARE -- WE'RE EXAMINING HOW MANY OFFERS DO WE MAKE ON THAT FIRST ROUND. BECAUSE WERE ABLE TO FILL ALL OUR SEATS -- FOR FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. SYSTEM WIDE. THERE ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OF ON SLIDE. SIXTEEN I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO ARE THE STUDENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN AND ROLLING -- OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS THE ETHNIC MIX OF THE UC STUDENT POPULATION HAS BEEN CHANGING. OF THE LATINO LATINO STUDENT POPULATION IS THE FASTEST GROWING AMONG ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA AND RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES -- AND WE NOW HAVE MULTIPLE CAMPUSES THAT ARE. CONSIDERED HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THOSE DESIGNATIONS. I USE THESE FACULTY HIRING -- IS. IMPROVING TO REFLECT THE STUDENT BODY THAT WE SERVE. OF BOTH DEFINITELY MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AMONG THE PUBLIC AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES IS 8% UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY AND YOU SEE IS A 10% SO WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THAN THE OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN HIRING FACULTY WHO LOOK LIKE THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS STUFF WHERE AND ROLLING -- FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE VERY GENEROUSLY PROVIDED US WITH ONE TIME MONEY TWO MILLION A YEAR ONE TIME FOR THREE YEARS. TO DO FACULTY -- DIVERSITY HIRING PROGRAMS PILOT PROGRAMS AND WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THOSE PROGRAMS. OF WERE NOW INSTITUTING FOR HIRING SYSTEM WIDE FACULTY DIVERSITY STATEMENTS SO THE CANDIDATES FOR JOBS WILL TALK ABOUT. HOW DO THEY HOW DO HOW DO THEY PERCEIVE IT THAT THAT -- AND WHAT WHAT CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO THE CAMPUS -- AND ALSO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHERE TO ADVERTISE FOR FACULTY POSITIONS IN ORDER TO GET A MITE MORE DIVERSE GROUP OF CANDIDATES FOR FACULTY POSITIONS SO. WHERE -- WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE ON THAT. ON SLIDE. SEVENTEEN THE NEXT SLIDE UP INTO SPEAKING PRIMARILY ABOUT OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROMAN SO FAR I KNOW THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- BUT ARE YOU CEASE. ENROLLMENT OF NON RESIDENTS HAS ALSO BEEN GROWING IN RECENT YEARS. IN THIS CHART ON FLIGHT SEVENTEEN YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE -- HOW THE NON RESIDENTS REPRESENTED BY DARK YELLOW BAR HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST DECADE? THE NON RESIDENT ROMAN HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CORE FUND REVENUES FOR THE UNIVERSITY -- YOU WILL RECALL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION THAT I STAYED AT THAT NON RESIDENT TUITION IS NOW OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES FOR THE UNIVERSITY THAT'S BEING PAID BY THOSE THAT YELLOW BAR THERE. OF THE REGIONS ON MARCH FOURTEENTH DECIDED TO DELAY A VOTE TO INCREASE NONRESIDENTS SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION BY TWO POINT 6%. OF THAT INCREASE WOULD HAVE YIELDED -- ANOTHER ALMOST TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE THAT THE UNIVERSITY BUT THE VOTE HAS BEEN DELAYED. ON THAT -- AN ON SLIDE. EIGHTEEN I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE FOUR FUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. OVER THE LAST -- TWO DECADES. OR WE'VE MOVING AWAY FROM NON RESIN -- WE CAN TALK ABOUT NON REST I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORE FUNDS FOR STUDENT NUMBER HOW WE WOULD SPEND THE ENROLLMENT MONEY THAT WE'RE REQUESTING. WELL I HAVE A COUPLE MAY ASK A QUESTION YES OF COURSE SO I NOTICED THAT -- THE APPARENTLY A COUPLE OF THE CAMPUSES EXCEEDED THEIR CAP ON NON RESIDENT [inaudible] ESTIMATION. I I HAVE A GENERAL CONCERN AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY -- RESTRICTED TO THE UC CAMPUS IT HAPPENS TO BE IN THE SENATE DISTRICT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT ITS ITS ITS ITS OTHER UC CAMPUSES AS WELL. THAT ARE NOT AS ATTRACTIVE APPARENTLY TO THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT AS SOME OF THE MORE -- SOME CAMPUSES COULD IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A CAP COULD PROBABLY FLOAT TO NON RESIDENT STUDENT POPULATION MUCH HIGHER THAN THE CAP I WOULD ASSUME. I BELIEVE SO -- AND WHAT THAT DOES WHEN WE HAVE -- RESIDENT TUITION SORT OF LEVEL OR FLAT. IT'LL ALLOW SOME CAMPUSES -- TO TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT. ON CAMPUS REVENUES THROUGH NON RESIDENT TUITION AND IF WE HAVE WON THE NON RESIDENT TUITION INCREASE. HOW DO YOU HOW HOW CAN WE DESIGN A PLAN TO SORT OF SPREAD THAT? EXTRA MONEY. ACROSS ALL OF THE UC CAMPUSES THOSE THAT HAVE NO TROUBLE ATTRACTING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS AND THOSE THAT HAVE TROUBLE. ATTRACTING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS SO THAT WE BOATS FLOAT TO THE SAME LEVEL. ANY CHANGE IN THE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION FORMULA WOULD HAVE TO GO TO BE APPROVED BY THE REGENTS -- CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PROPOSED CHANGE TO OUR OF FORMULA IN FRONT OF THE REGIONS. OF THE CAMPUS THAT IN ROLES TO STUDENT GETS TO KEEP THE REVENUE FROM THAT STUDENT -- PARTLY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT STUDENT AND IN ORDER TO GROW SERVICES FOR THE RESIDENT STUDENTS THROUGH THE EXTRA REVENUE THAT THEY GOT FROM THOSE NON RESIDENTS -- I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SIR THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER SOME KIND OF A DIFFERENTIAL REVENUE SHARE WITH JUST IT IT CREATES OF CERTAIN INEQUITY IN THE IN THE IN THE SYSTEM AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL. SEPARATIONS AND ALL THAT BUT IT DOES CREATE SORT OF IT SEEMS TO ME AN INEQUITY IN THE SYSTEM. BUT HAVE CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE NOT CAMPUSES AS IT PERTAINS. TO NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION AND THE COST OF EDUCATING THE STUDENT. THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT PROBABLY IS THE SAME AS THE COST OF EDUCATING THE RESIDENT STUDENT TO THE MOST YES. AND SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE THAT IS ABLE TO BE USED BY THE HAVE CAMPUSES. THAT THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT. DO WITHOUT AND AND WHAT PIQUED MY CURIOSITY WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN. TO DEAL WITH THE NET REVENUE GENERATED BY -- THE OVER AND ROLL BUT OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ABOVE THE CAPTAIN IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THAT'S GOING TO SORT OF BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT'S CORRECT SIR AND AND I WAS WHEN I READ THAT I THOUGHT WELL WHAT WHY IS THAT MONEY. IF IF NOTHING ELSE NOT BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THE CAMPUSES THAT DON'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING NON. STUDENTS IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN -- TO THIS INCENTIVIZE. THIS NON RESIDENT OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT IF THAT'S THE GOAL -- HERE YOU SAY CORRECTLY THAT YOU WOULD PREFER THE OVER ENROLLMENT FUNDING FROM THOSE NON RESIDENTS BE GIVEN TO THE CAMPUSES TO MAKE CERTAIN OF ONE TWO CAMPUSES THAT DID NOT OVER AND ROLL ONLY. RIGHT OR THE OKAY OKAY OR THOSE CAMPUSES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO OF SECURE VERY MANY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS IN THERE BY GENERATE THE ADDITIONAL OPERATING REVENUES AT SOME CAMPUSES A RIPPLE TO GENERATE. OF WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND I MEAN I DON'T HAVE. MY SAY RIGHT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I'M JUST I WAS EXPRESSING CONCERN WITH THE WAY THE NON RESIDENT TUITION. SYSTEM WORKS ACROSS YOU SEE BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S MORE THAN. ONE UC CAMPUS. THAT HAS TROUBLE ATTRACTING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS -- YES YES WE HAVE WE HAVE A FEW OF THOSE AND THEN THERE'S SOME ON THE COAST OF PROBABLY HAVE NO TROUBLE ATTRACTING NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN IT SORT OF CREATES AN INEQUITY IN THE WAY THE THE REVENUE SYSTEM WORKS AMONG UC CAMPUSES AND I I'M. I'M JUST HOPEFUL WOULD YOU ALL THERE'S A MORE EQUITABLE WAY TO AT LEAST -- DISTRIBUTE SOME OF THE FUNDS -- HOW ABOVE THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO EDUCATE? STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM. SIR I WILL TAKE YOUR PERSPECTIVE BACK TO OUR LEADERSHIP THAT'S ALWAYS WHAT IS THAT I I DIDN'T MEAN TO BELABOR THE POINT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING READ THOUGH SO I WANT TO ASK BUT PLEASE PROCEED. ALL RIGHT -- SO ON SLIDE EIGHTEEN I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING FOR STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE FOR THIS IS LOOKING SYSTEM WIDE. ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU SEE OUR TOTAL FUNDS OF FROM THAT. OF IN ACTUAL DOLLARS OUR CORE FUNDS HAVE BEEN INCREASING A LOT OF THIS IS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN PROVIDING YOU SEE WITH MORE FUNDING CONSISTENTLY ESTY ECONOMY IMPROVED. THE LEGISLATURE WAS PROVIDING YOU SEE WITH FUNDING AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. BUT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON THE MIDDLE CHART THERE. YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR STUDENT ENROLLMENT AS A WHOLE INCREASED BY 59% OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TAKING ON A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STUDENTS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND THE DOLLARS THE DOLLARS AVAILABLE PER STUDENT SYSTEM WHITE OUR CAMPUSES HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED BY. IS THERE A PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE READ IN THE BUDGET YOU KNOW GOING TO ENROLL TWO THOUSAND WERE YOU DOING. WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU WHATEVER IT IS TWENTY HELLO WE USE. IN DOING OUR BUDGETING. A NO WE AGREE WITH THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION THAT. WE USE CURRENTLY -- IT'S JUST THAT. THE STATE FUNDS HAVEN'T KEPT UP FULLY WITH THE ENROLLMENT AND WE WE NEED WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OKAY I'LL GO TO SCHOOL ON THAT SO NEXT TIME I'LL BE SMARTER. SO THE MARGIN WE WE BUDGET TO THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION. HELP ME FINANCE THAT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH BUT IT'S EARLY IN THE PAST WE'VE GIVEN MORE. WELL HOW DO WE DO THAT WE GET IF WE BROUGHT BUDGETING TO THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION HOW DO WE HAVE A 31% DECREASE. THIRTY ONE ARE A LOT OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR CUT THE UNIVERSITY TOOK IN THE GREAT RECESSION. WE WERE WE WERE CUT FROM THREE BILLION TO TWO BILLION AND WHILE YOU'VE BEEN BUILDING OUR BUDGET UP I SEE IN HER ROOM AND WE IN ROMAN GROUP AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY IT RESTORED. IN PROPORTION THE MONEY THAT WE TOOK FROM YOU THAT'S CORRECT SIR I GET IT TAKES ME AWHILE. OF THANKS FINE IT'S I THINK I GOT IT RIGHT. YOU'RE DEAD YOU GOT IT THANK YOU SIR -- ON THE NEXT SLIDE I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN THE IMPACT OF THIS DECREASE IN QUALITY FOR STUDENTS. EARTH THE IMPACT ON QUALITY OF THIS 31% DECREASE IN FUNDING FOR STUDENT. AND YOU'LL SEE THERE THAT YOU CEASE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY OVER THE LAST. OUR SINS ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS BUT EXPRESSLY AND WE'VE BEEN GOING UP A LITTLE BIT -- OUR COMPARISON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE WAY BELOW US. SO EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPARISON PUBLIC THEY'VE PAID THEIR FACULTY ALONG A LITTLE BIT LESS. THERE ARE -- THERE. THEY HAVE A LOT MORE STATE FUNDING AND PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN QUITE FRANKLY HAVE 40% NON RESIDENT EMPLOYMENT SO THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE COMING INTO THOSE KINDS OF SOURCES -- AND THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR STUDENT FACULTY RATIOS LOWER -- AND FLIGHT TWENTY IS WHERE I REALLY WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION BUT IS IS VERY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS OR IS IT GENERALLY. THE SAME ACROSS CAMPUS IT VARIES FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS THESE ARE SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGES AND IT ALSO VARIES WITH IN. DISCIPLINES ON CAMPUSES SO BACK TO THE NON RESIDENT TUITION CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD. THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WHO PAY NON RESIDENT TUITION. WHAT I IF I WERE? TO DO A DEEP DIVE WHAT I FIND THAT THEIR STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO IS IS LOWER. THE LET'S SAY. I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THOSE NUMBERS LET ME BRING THEM TO YOUR OFFICE. YES IF I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE. BUT YOU MAY BE CORRECT ON THAT -- SLIDE. TWENTY OF OUR OVERALL STUDENT SATISFACTION AT UC AND THIS IS REALLY THESE NUMBERS HERE ON SLIDE TWENTY ARE ASED ON A SURVEY THAT WE DO OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE EVERY TWO YEARS WHERE WE ASK THEM HOWARE YOU LIKING THE SEE. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX UNDER RIGHT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THERE -- STUDENTS WERE UP ASKED KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW WHAT I STILL CHOOSE TO ENROLL AT MY UC CAMPUS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THIRTY THREE PER ONLY YES ABSOLUTELY I WOULD COME AGAIN. OF BY TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT A STRONG 218%. SAID STRONGLY YES. SO THERE'S THERE'S A TREND OCCURRING THERE WERE STUDENTS ARE BECOMING LESS SATISFIED. WITH WHAT THEY'RE RECEIVING A QC. BUT PERHAPS SOME OF THE MOST DISTURBING DATA IS THERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. THAT IN THE LAST DECADE FROM NOT GET INTO THEIR FIRST MAJOR. INCREASE FROM 3% 213%. THE 13% OF OUR INCOMING FRESHMAN CLASS CAN'T GET INTO THE MAJOR THAT THEY WANT TO GET INTO BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPACTED. BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH FACULTY TEACHING THEM. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LOSS OF HUMAN POTENTIAL STUDENTS CAN STUDY THE THING THEY'RE ACTUALLY PASSIONATE OR INTERESTED IN -- AND ALSO THERE'S A SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN A DAY MAYBE KICK START FEELING LOST MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH OUR LIVES TO TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE LOOKS AT HER? SO WHAT'S THE GATE THERE IS THE GATE THE FIRST THE ENTRY LEVEL COURSE INTO A PARTICULAR MAJORS HAVE POLITICAL SCIENCE ONE A ONE AND THEY CAN'T GET INTO THAT. AND IF THE CASTING CAN'T GET INTO THAT THEN THEY CAN'T BE A POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR. ALRIGHT YOU TOTAL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE A POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TWENTY FIVE MORE AND SO IF FIFTY SHOW UP AT THE FRONT GATE. TWENTY FIVE GET IN AND TWENTY FIVE LADDER THAT FIFTY SHOW UP IN TWENTY FIVE DON'T GET IT YEAH BECAUSE YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DECLARE POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR IN YOU KNOW. BUT YOU CAN ONLY HANDLE A THOUSAND OF THEM THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YEAH I DID NOT KNOW THAT'S INTERESTING -- AND THEN ALSO WE'RE FINDING THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FEELING LESS CONNECTED WITH THEIR FACULTY SO THERE'S BEEN A 14% OF DROP. IN STUDENTS WHO SAY THEY KNOW THEIR FACULTY WELL ENOUGH TO ASK FOR A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION. WHEN OUR FRESHMEN COME INTO UC TO GRADUATE SCHOOL -- IF YOU GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND GET A PROFESSIONAL DEGREE OR PHD ARE MASTERS. YOU CAN EARN A LOT MORE MONEY IN YOUR CAREER AND HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. BUT IF THEY CAN'T ASK FOR A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION. THEY CAN'T GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL. THAT'S A REQUIREMENT WHY IS THAT IS THAT BECAUSE THE INCREASED USE OF LECTURERS OR THE AVERAGE WITH ASSISTANCE OR TEACHING COURSES WHAT WHAT BECAUSE THE WHERE WHERE HAD NOW HAVING OUR LATERITE FACULTY TEACH VERY LARGE. LECTURES WITH THAT -- STUDENT INTERACTION TAKING PLACE WITH THE GRADUATE STUDENTS DOCTORS. AND SO THE STUDENTS HAVE. IS THAT THE CASE ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THE THE I FORGET WHAT YOU CALL THEM. YOU'RE THE LOWER DIVISION COURSES IN AS OPPOSED TO THE UPPER DIVISION. YEAH THAT'S MORE THE LOWER DIVISION AND AN UPPER DIVISION YOU HAVE MORE CONTACT WITH A FACULTY MEMBER. BUT NOW WE ARE TEACHING A LOT MORE OF THE UPPER DIVISION COURSES WITH LECTURES I SEE. AND WHAT DRIVES THAT ARE NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE FACULTY. I WISH I COULD YOU HELLO. MY EXACT QUESTION THAT I HAD BUT THE PUBLIC AND GET HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE. GRAND UNDERGROUND ARE THERE -- AT I HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS ARE SOMEWHAT OF WE HAVE TO HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS -- I BELIEVE ABOUT. FIFTY SEVEN OF THEM ARE -- OKAY YEAH IT JUST THAT'S A PHENOMENAL NUMBER I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. EVEN WITH MORE FACTLY I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU. HOW YOU DO THAT WE MAY NOT SOLVE IT BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY HOPE HOPING TO CLOSE THE GAP OKAY YEAH WELL THAT'S A LOT OF IT DEFINITELY IS YEAH. WOULD YOU SEE YOUR HAS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YEAH I SAID SYSTEM MY NUMBER SO NO I KNOW I THINK I COULD THINK OF SO ROSE ASKING IN. YES THE BRAINS ON THE DIS TO MY RIGHT. FIGURED OUT THE THE NUMBER MY THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE TOLD A DEVICE TO NOT -- WE HAVE THIS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T THIS. FOCUS OF THE BUDGET HEARING BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO FACULTY DO OFFICE HOURS AND CONTACT AND THEY THEY DO -- OFFICE HOURS BUT IF THEY HAVE GONE FROM HAVING. SAY THREE COURSES WITH OF FORTY STUDENTS IN THEM. THE THREE COURSES WITH A HUNDRED STUDENTS IN EACH. THE OFFICE HOURS ARE ALSO IMPACTED I SEE YES -- ON SLIDE TWENTY ONE I HAVE ARE -- I PRESENT THE REGION'S PLAN FOR MONEY THAT THEY ARE HERE REQUESTING FROM YOU TODAY -- THE REGIONS AS PART OF THE MULTI YEAR FRAMEWORK WANT TO HIRE ADDITIONAL LETTERING FACULTY ABOVE AND BEYOND THEY'RE JUST A REPLACEMENT OF THOSE WHO RETIRE AND LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY. AND IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH THIS AND ROMAN CROSS FUNDING THAT WE ARE REQUESTING THE ENROLLMENT MONEY THAT WE'RE REQUESTING. WE WOULD HIRE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NEW LETTERING FACULTY ON TOP OF THE OF LATTER THE FACULTIES OF WE NEED TO REPLACE THE ONES WERE LEAVING. SO THAT'S OUR PLAN. TO THE YOU SEE OF COURSE HAS A AS A RESEARCH MISSION AND THAT'S THE MASTER PLAN AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. DOES THE FACT THAT YOU SEE IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND THE FACT THAT THE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED BY. OBVIOUSLY THE MOST. EXPERIENCED AND SENIOR FACULTY AT AMONG OTHERS. DOES THAT IMPACT THE THE FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO AND THE ABILITY OF A STUDENT HAVE CONTACT WITH THE PROFESSOR FOR EXAMPLE AT UCLA -- AND AND DO YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY. PERSUADING OR FORCING FULL TIME. PROFESSORS THE MORE EXPERIENCED FACULTY. OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE CLASSROOM. MOON MANY QUESTIONS THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME THAT I'VE LOST. THE THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIOS DISCOUNTED BASED ON FACULTY F. T. E. REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FACULTY SPENDING THEIR TIME SO IT'S HOW MANY FACULTY ARE EMPLOYED. VERSUS HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED. IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIENCED FACULTY OF THE SOME OF THEM WHO BRING IN THE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR GRANTS THAT SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS SIX ADDRESS -- ARE ALLOWED -- TO DO WHAT'S CALLED A BUYOUT THROUGH THEIR GRANT FUNDS OF THEIR OWN TIME IF THEY PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY WITH FUNDS TO HIRE A LECTURER INSTEAD THEY CAN BE RELEASED FROM ONE OF THEIR COURSES THAT THEY NEED TO TEACH. IN RDER TO DEVOTE MORE OF THEIR TIME TO TEACH INSISTS THAT THAT FLATTERING FACULTY MIGHT HAVE LESS. OF TEACHING TIME WITH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS BUT MORE LABORATORY TIME WITH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN THEIR ACTUAL OF RESEARCH ROLE. OF IN TERMS OF FACULTY ENJOYING TEACHING STUDENTS. IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL FACULTY MY FATHER WAS A PROFESSOR AND HE DID NOT ENJOY TEACHING UNDERGRADUATES. AND MY OLDER BROTHERS A PROFESSOR AND HE SPECIFICALLY REQUEST TO TEACH UNDERGRADUATES BECAUSE HE ENJOYS THEM SO. IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL FASCINATING ISSUE MAYBE THE BIOS SHOULD BE INCREASED SO WE CAN HER TENURE TRACK FACULTY INSTEAD OF LECTURES AND MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP SOLVE THE STUDENTS SATISFACTION. I'M I'M NOT A 100% CERTAIN ON THAT BECAUSE THE IT COMES OUT OF THE GRANT AND IT'S ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE GRANT A PROVIDER. WHAT THEY ALLOW AS PART OF THEIR GRANTS? THE AT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO WHAT MOST OF OUR GRANTS COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERMITS ON THAT GRANT YOUR TERM LIMITED AND SO AND SO WERE LECTURES. YES THE TENURE TRACK FACULTY OR NOT SO THAT PROBABLY IS THE ANSWER BUT IT MAY ALSO CREATE THE PROBLEM INTERESTING I DON'T MEAN TO GET YOU OFF TRACK THANK YOU -- SOMEONE PAGE TWENTY ONE JUST TO REITERATE THAT IS OUR PLAN HIRING PLAN WITH THE ENROLLMENT FUNDS OF WE'RE REQUESTING WE ARE INTENDING TO USE THESE FUNDS. TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS THROUGH IN OUR INSTRUCTIONAL MISSION THAT'S THE TAKEAWAY. ON THE NEXT DECIDED BY -- THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. WOULD YOU LIKE FINEST AGREEMENT FIRST THIRTY ONE MAY TWO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ON FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ON ISSUES THREE IS IT WORKING THANK YOU -- FOR MOVEMENT ISSUE. THREE AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES SOONER NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE YOU SEE THIS IS. GREATER THAN FOUR TIMES WAS PROPOSED TO THE SEA AT LAST YEAR'S. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- IN LIGHT OF THIS AND IN EXCHANGE THESE FUNDS -- THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS YOU SEE TO MAINTAIN CURRENT TUITION AND FEE LEVELS -- FLAT AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE ARE HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OF METROPOLIS HONDA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE ON SHORT AND LONG TERM INITIATIVES WITH EASY TO PROVIDE FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. INCREASE ACCESS IMPROVED IN SUCCESS CREATE A MORE COST EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND PROBABLY BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS NEEDED FOR THE ECONOMY NOW AND IN THE FUTURE THANKS THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT HELLO. SO THERE ARE THREE ISSUES HERE IN THIS ITEM -- THE FIRST PERTAINS TO RESIDENT TUITION AND FEES THE SECOND PERTAINS TO NON RESIDENT TUITION AND FEES. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RAISED REGARDING IMPROVING FISCAL STABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THEIR AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. SOLDIERS EACH ISSUE. REGARDING RED OUR ANALYSIS -- AT THE TIME THERE WERE STILL SOME DISCUSSION MOTHER NOT THERE'D BE A TUITION INCREASE YOU SEE HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL NOT INCREASE TUITION. NONE THE LESS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE SIXTEEN YOUR AGENDA. WITH WHICH IS A IS A OF THE FIGURE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IT ESTIMATES. I TRIED TO ESTIMATE THE HOW MUCH OF THE HOW MUCH CORE FUNDING IS SHARED BETWEEN. OF THE STATE HOW MUCH THE BY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THEIR SHARED BY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. AND THE REASON WHY WE WE THINK THE FIGURES ROLLED RELEVANT IS BECAUSE AS THE LEGISLATURES ARE WAYS TO WHICH INCREASES EVERY YEAR. REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE LEGISLATURE WANTED YOUR COST INCREASES EACH YEAR BETWEEN THE STATE. BETWEEN STUDENTS AND ALSO INCREASINGLY BETWEEN NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. I'M IN YEARS WHERE THE STATE DOESN'T INCREASE TUITION EFFECTIVELY THAT INCREASES THE STATE FAIR TO COVER COSTS IS THE STATE'S COVERING THE COST INCREASES IN THAT YEAR -- IN YEARS WHERE THERE'S NOT REALLY A RATHER IS A TUITION HIKE THAT INCREASES THE STUDENTS SHARE AND YOURS WERE THEY INCREASE ROUGHLY PROPORTIONATE THAT KIND OF KEEP THAT SHARON. AND ON TRACK AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THE STAY FIND A SOMEWHAT OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY DURING THE RECESSION WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR BUDGET CUTS ENACTED AND YOU SEE -- COVERED SOME OF THAT WITH A TUITION INCREASE ON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- BUT IT'S STILL MORE THAN A HALF IF YOU IF YOU FACTOR IN -- FINANCIALLY THAT STATE PROVIDES BOTH THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND ALSO THAT TUITION AND FEES ARE WAIVED TO STUDENTS THREE YOU SEE A AND SO AGAIN THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS. IS DOES THIS MAKE SENSE IT'S IT'S A FEATURE TO LOW TO TO HIRE STUDENTS CONTRIBUTING TO MUCH. OF THAT'S REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE EACH YEAR THAT EVALUATES TUITION INCREASES. REGARDING THE SECOND ISSUE NON RESIDENT TUITION I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT OUR ANALYSIS HAD HAD RECOMMENDED THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER -- THE NON RESIDENT TUITION INCREASES THAT YOU SEE HAD PLANNED TO ADOPT AND USE THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTS. OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS RECENTLY AND REJECTED A TUITION INCREASE SO THAT ASSOCIATED REVENUE WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET COSTS AND LESS OF THE REGIONS. AT A LATER TIME DECIDE TO INCREASE THAT [inaudible] TUITION CHARGE. AND WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST DAY A TIRD ISSUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RAISES. FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE. FOURTEEN FOURTEEN IS REALLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT WHEN WHEN THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FISCAL SEE US THE BILLETING. AS YOU CAN SEE. UP IN SOME PERIOD SO THE STATE'S HISTORY TUITION HAS BEEN FLAT OR EVEN DECLINED. AND THEIR OTHER YEARS WERE THERE HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY NOTABLE TUITION HIKES THAT'S LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE STATE OF THE BY THE STATE BUDGET AND YEARS WERE REVENUES ARE STRONG THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP TUITION FLAT. AND YEARS WERE THEIR BUDGET REDUCTIONS YOU SEE IS HOW TO CREASES AND THAT. CREATES SOME UNPREDICTABILITY FOR STUDENTS AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THREE YEARS AND IN COLLEGE. WE THINK THAT THIS IS THAT APPROPRIATE -- POLICY ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. I'M BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS AFFECTED BY THE STATE BUDGET ONE KEY WAY TO LEGISLATE WHEN HE TOLD THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO ENSURE STABILITY IS TO SET ASIDE FUNDS AND IN THE GENERAL FUND RESERVE VERY YEAR. SUCH THAT WHEN THERE IS A RECESSION IT CAN USE THOSE FUNDS. TO COVER -- UP A POTENTIAL BUDGET CUTS AND IF IT IN YEARS WERE REVENUES DECLINED. ANOTHER UP ENDED IN TANDEM TO THAT -- HAVING A CLEAR POLICY ON HOW MUCH STUDENTS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE EACH YEAR TO THEIR OUR COSTS WOULD ALSO HELP. ENSURE THAT THERE'S A CLEAR POLICY IN A TRANSPARENT POLICY GUIDING TUITION INCREASES IN THE WAY THAT MY WORK. AS A LEGISLATURE WOULD DECIDE WHAT WHAT YEAR OF COST SHOULD STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE TO THEY CONTRIBUTE 10% SHOULD THEY CONTRIBUTE 20%. AND IT WOULD. BE AN OPERATIONAL POLICY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WORK TOWARDS EVERY YEAR AND WHAT'S ATTAINING THAT. PROPORTION IT WOULD THEN SHARE CO EQUALLY GENTLE FUN TUITION EACH YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO ADD MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THE TUITION DISCUSSION WELL ISN'T THERE OF ISN'T THERE MEAN THERE'S THERE'S A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TUITION TUITION INCREASES IN OUR KELLGREN EXPENDITURES IN THE BUDGET OR ISN'T. THERE. THAT'S ALSO TRUE WITH EVERY WED TUITION INCREASE ALSO -- THE CAL GRANT ALSO INCREASES THE COVER THAT BECAUSE I MEAN I MEAN I GUESS I COULD. TAKE THE CHARTS AND SOMEWHERE IN HERE THIS. YEAH LOOKS LIKE. SOMETHING OUT OF GEOLOGY -- IN SORT OF FIGURE THAT OUT BUT I MEAN THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP SO IF YOU INCREASE TUITION CALGARY GOES UP DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD BETTER [inaudible] RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER THING YOU MENTIONED RESERVES AND I WE'VE HEARD IT IN HERE AND I WILL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IT BEFORE IN EARLIER SESSIONS YOU KNOW THE THE SYSTEMS WOULD WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SORT OF MULTI YEAR LOOK WITH THE WITH THE SOME SORT OF QUESTION IN. A RESERVE DON'T HAVE BUDGETARY TURBULENCE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR ENROLLMENT AND PLAN FOR HIRING AND IF I IF I LISTEN TO THE BOTH OF THE UC REPRESENTATIVE AND THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR THE OTHER DAY. YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WITH THE WAY WE DO HIRE READ BUDGETING HERE. IS IT IT'S IT CAUSES TURBULENCE. YOU KNOW MID YEAR. UPS AND DOWNS AND IF THEY HAD SOME IF THEY WERE ASSURED OF A OF A CONSTANT. OVER ONE TO MY MAKING SENSE OVER ONE AND TWO AND FINANCE IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE I'M NOT BUT OVER ONE AND TWO AND THREE YEAR PERIOD THEN THEY COULD. THEY THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD KNOW HOW TO PLAN AND IT'S NOT THE WAY WE BUDGET. GET OVER THEM WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH WITH USING PARTICULAR REGARDING LONG TERM BUDGETARY -- WORK AT MORGAN IN THE FUTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GONNA PRIORITIZE THAT THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF OF OUR STUDENTS RIGHT WE WILL SOLVE THAT TODAY. DID I CATCH YOU OFFICER. THAT'S THE END THANK YOU OKAY. LOVE LOST WORRY YOU SEE -- WE ARE ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF MY PRESENTATION -- SO I WAS GOING TO JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE TYPES OF FEES YOU SEE HAS -- AND YOU DID ASK IF CAL GRANTS GO UP -- WIND FEES INCREASE CURRENT POLICY IS THAT CAL GRANTS ARE LINKED TO THE FEES AT THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. SO EVERY TIME WE INCREASE OUR TUITION CAL GRANT PAYMENTS OCT DO GO UP AS WELL AND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING ABOUT. NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CAL GRANT ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE. SO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT -- SO SYSTEM WIDE CHARGES OF THAT ARE THE SAME ACROSS FOR ALL CAMPUSES. AND THESE ARE TUITION. OF WHICH ALL STUDENTS PAY REGARDLESS OF THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS UNDERGRADS RESIDENTS NONRESIDENTS EVERYBODY PAYS THE TUITION -- AND WE TAKE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR TUITION REVENUE AND SPEND IT ON FINANCIAL AID. OF STUDENT SERVICES FEE -- PAYS FOR THE SERVICES FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT PART OF INSTRUCTION ON THE CAMPUSES -- AND STUDENT SERVICES FEE -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION IS PAID ONLY BY OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- THERE IS A WAIVER PROCESS FOR OUR UNDOCUMENTED A. B. FIVE FORTY STUDENTS. BUT THAT WAIVER PROCESS DOES NOT CAPTURE EVERY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM -- PARTLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. TENDED A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS I GRADUATED FROM A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THAT A. B. FIVE FORTY WAIVER -- WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE CAMPUS BASED FEE A CAMPUS BASED FREE IS A FEVER -- THAT CAN COME ABOUT IN TWO WAYS MOSTLY VOTED IN BY THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. THE STUDENTS CAN CHOOSE TO TAX THEMSELVES FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES THEY CAN DO THIS. FOR OF SOME. PROGRAMS -- SERVICE PRO THAT THEY DO -- AND FOR EXAMPLE AS TO UC DAVIS -- THERE IS A US LET'S SEE THEY DO CHARGE THEMSELVES A MEMORIAL UNION FEE -- WHICH HELPS PAY FOR PARTICULAR BUILDING ON THE CAMPUS -- UPGRADES TO THAT IT'S A STUDENT MEETING PLACE WHERE THEY CAN STUDY AND HAVE THEIR CLUBS AND SUCH [inaudible] SO OF THE CAMPUS BASED FEES ARE VOTED IN EITHER BY THE STUDENTS OR REQUESTED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION APPROVED BY THE REGENTS. SO IF THE THERE'S TO PROCESS THESE FOR THAT THEY VARY BY CAMPUS SO THEY'RE NOT THE SAME FOR ANY ANY TWO CAMPUSES. WELL THE REASON I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THE ANALYSIS OU MAY HAVE SEEN REFERENCES CAMPUS BASED FEES AND REFERRING TO CAMPUS BASED FEES SET BY CHANCE OR IS AN APPROVED BY THE REGENTS THE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES WAS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS SUCH AS THE SEISMIC. RETROFIT OF A BUILDING I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A CONCRETE EXAMPLE WHEN THEY UC SYSTEM BUT IF IT IS. I WAS WONDERING WHY IN THE WORLD WE WOULD USE A CAMPUS BASE FEE. FOR THAT SERVER OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT WE OUGHT TO BE. WE OUGHT TO BE FUNDING THAT OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET OR THROUGH A BOND -- AS OPPOSED TO CHARGING STUDENTS TO SEISMICALLY RETROFIT THE BUILDING -- IF THOSE THOSE CAMPUS BASED FEES HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE REGIONS IN THE PAST THE BEST WAY TO FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAMS IS A DEAL BOND. DEFINITELY -- WE ALSO HAVE AN INTERNAL CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS NOW THAT ALLOWS US. TO SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS. AND THEN ONCE THAT APPROVAL IS GAINED WE CAN USE OUR INTERNAL OPERATING REVENUES -- AS COLLATERAL TOWARD. A DEATH PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS US TO WE HAVEN'T YOU SEE HAS NOT HAD A COUPON SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIX SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WITHOUT THOSE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS FOR AWHILE YOU'LL LET US KNOW HOWEVER IF CAN'T CAMPUS BASED FEES TO USED TO DO. WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A CAPITAL PROJECT THAT THEY ART THERE ARE USED FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS ON MULTIPLE CAMP WILL WELL? OTHER THAN A STUDENT. RED I REALIZE THE STUDENT BUILD FOR YOUR SIR TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF AVAIL ELIGIBLE BUILDINGS BEING ACADEMIC BUILDINGS BEING RETROFITTED YES I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF. ANY OF THOSE X. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE STUDENTS PAY FOR THEIR BUILDINGS THAT THEY USE FOR NON ACADEMIC. ISSUES THROUGH STUDENT FEES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER. I READ THIS IS BEING -- AND AN ACADEMIC BUILDING. I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT PARTICULAR FEE PERFECT YES. I'M MORE BETTER VERSED IN IN THE SYSTEM WIDE FEES. AND ON SLIDE TWENTY THREE I INCLUDED FOR YOUR CHARTS WITH VERY SMALL PRINT I APOLOGIZE I HOPE YOUR EYES CAN READ THAT -- ON THE LEFT THERE OF WHAT OUR UNDERGRADUATE THE THE FEES HAVE BEEN -- SO IT SAYS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT TUITION BUT IT'S BEEN TUITION THE SAME FOR ALL STUDENTS ALL THOSE YEARS. AND THEN THE STUDENT SERVICES FEE AND WHAT IT IS ON OUR FOR OUR RESIDENTS SO -- FOR NINETEEN TWENTY ARE UC PRESIDENT JANET APOLLO TANO SAID THAT SHE WOULD NOT SEEK A TUITION INCREASE. FOR OUR FOR THE SYSTEM WIDE FREE SO TOTAL SYSTEM WIDE FEES TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES FEE WOULD BE TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS. FOR OUR STUDENTS NOW THIS MAKES -- MAKES IT SO THAT IN THE LAST. SEVEN YEARS -- WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE TUITION ACTUALLY SEEN A SMALL DECREASE LAST YEAR OF SIXTY DOLLARS. WHEN THE LIQUID A CHARGE ONE AWAY? OF THE REGION'S BUDGET PLAN INCLUDED -- TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES FEE BY OUT FOR SIXTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT WOULD HELP BY -- IN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INCREASING TUITION OURSELVES WE ARE REQUESTING THATTHE STATE PROVIDE US WITH MONEY BUT THAT MONEY IS PART OF THE ENROLLMENT REQUEST WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH SO YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T NEED. TO CONTEMPLATE THAT. AS A SEPARATE AMOUNT -- ONSITE TWENTY FOUR I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA OF HOW DOES THE UNIVERSITY SPEND OUR STUDENT FEE REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVE -- AND YOU'LL SEE THERE THAT ABOUT -- STUDENT FEES TO REMIND YOUR ABOUT 42% OF THE CORE FUNDS THIS IS THE TUITION STUDENT SERVICES FEE COMPONENT OF THESE FEES. AND 61% GO TO INSTRUCTION SO THIS IS TO PAY. FOR A OT OF RANK FACULTY LECTURERS ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS DOCTORS -- ANOTHER 27% GOES TO FINANCIAL AID AND THE REASON THE FINANCIAL IS NOT THE FULL 33% IS BECAUSE THERE'S A HISTORICAL -- BASELINE TO IT WHERE IT USED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THIRD AND THEN IT'S A THIRD ON THE MARGINAL INCREASES. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT WE'RE PUTTING 23% OF 27% OF OF OUR FEES -- INTO FINANCIAL AID. AND THE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THOSE ARE SPENT ON TO VARIOUS STUDENT SERVICES -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BE A BUYOUT AS I ALREADY DISCUSSED WAS PROVIDERS ONE TIME FUNDING. AND THEN NON RESIDENT FEES ARE LISTED ON SLIDE. TWENTY FIVE YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ARE NOW PAYING ABOUT ANNUALLY IN THE THREE MANDATORY FEES THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THAT'S NOT INCLUDING CAMPUS BASED FEES. OF THE REGIONS HAVE A BUDGET PLAN TO INCREASE -- NON RESIDENT TUITION BY TWO POINT 6% HOWEVER THEY HAVE TABLETOP FOR NOW THEY DID NOT TAKE A VOTE ON IT AT THEIR LAST. HEARING AND AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS. HAVE THEIR NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION WAVED. ANY QUESTIONS ON OUR FEE STRUCTURE -- NO QUESTION. A ONE MORE COMMON SIR I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT -- YOU SEE DOES HAVE A EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM AND IN OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR THAT WE HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE 57% OF OUR STUDENTS DID NOT PAY TUITION BECAUSE FINANCIAL AID COVERED FOR THAT FOR THEM. THAT'S PRIMARILY THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. PELL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM I NOTICED ON THE AGENDA I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE I WASN'T AWARE THAT VERY GOOD. ARE WE ON THE NEXT TO BE READY FOR ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR YES WE'RE MOVING THROUGH THIS IMPRESSED -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- I'M GOING GENERAL FUND FOR DEGREE TEAM IS TO INSERVICE PROGRAMS THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW THE CITY TO HIRE NEEDED FACULTY AND OFFER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT BETTER ENABLE. NOW COMES. AND IMPROVE TIME TO DEGREE AT THE UC HAS BROAD DISCRETION USE THESE FUNDS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. LA -- ANY COMMENT. UP UP ALREADY THREE ISSUES FOR THE THE FIRST -- ISSUE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH OF THE THIS FUNDING WOULD ADDRESS A PRIORITY OF OF THE LEGISLATURE -- OBVIOUSLY THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT STUDENTS SUCCEED WHEN THEY GET TO COLLEGE -- YOU SEE STUDENTS HAVE THE HIGHEST GRADUATION RATES -- COMPARED TO THE STUDENTS AT CSUN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE PAST THE STATE HAS PRIORITIZED IN SUCCESS RESOURCES FOR CS YOU IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. REALLY FOCUSED ITS POLICY ATTENTION THAT YOU SEE ON OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE CONTROLLING COSTS INSURING ACCESS IMPROVING BUDGET TRANSPARENCY. THAT'S BEEN A REASONABLE WAY TO APPROACH THE THE DIFF SEGMENTS AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT -- POLICY ISSUES ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE THOUGH -- IF YOU GO TO PAGE TWENTY OF YOUR AGENDA AS WE RESEARCH THIS PROPOSAL WE DID. LEARN THAT YOU SEE IT HAS -- PRETTY PERSISTENT. ACTUATION RATE GAPS BETWEEN US DIFFERENT A GREAT RACE AND ETHNICITY GROUPS. ON THIS IS TRUE THE OTHER TWO SEGMENTS TRUE BUT IT IS PRESENT AT UC -- AND THIS WEEK WE'VE THIS THIS VERY WELL COULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS IT SWINGS OTHER BUDGET. IS OF DECISIONS. THE SECOND ISSUE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED YOU SEE WOULD HAVE. A BROAD DISCRETION TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS TWO CAMPUSES IN KANSAS WITH A BROAD DISCRETION TO USE THESE FUNDS TO ADDRESS STUDENT SUCCESS ISSUES -- AND USUALLY HAS DEVELOPED A LONG TERM PLAN WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT -- TO RICH AND IMPROVE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AT CERTAIN CAMPUSES WHERE THEY ARE LOWER. AND ALSO REDUCE A GRADUATION RATE ETHNICITY AND THEY'VE ALSO -- SUGGESTED SOME HIGH LEVEL. USERS OF THE FUNDS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A MORE DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLAN AND HOW CAMPUSES WOULD USE THE FUNDS. NOT CONCERN HERE IS IT'S NOT AND YOU SEE ALSO -- A IS HE ALSO SAYS THAT CAMPUSES WILL HAVE A LOT OF OF FLEXIBILITY DECIDE HOW THEY ALLOCATE THE FUNDS SO OUR CONCERN HERE. IS THAT -- IT'S UNCLEAR HOW EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED AND IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDS WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND ALSO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL. IS JUSTIFIED OR IF IT'S TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVES THAT YOU SEE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH. AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT AS YOU CONSIDER THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT YOU DIRECT YOU SEE TO HAVE A A TO DEVELOP AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT YOU CAN REVIEW BEFORE APPROPRIATING THE FUNDS. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE -- WE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS ACCOUNTABILITY THE BUDGET PROPOSAL UP A DOZEN PROPOSE. ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO REPORTING ON HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT AFTER THE APPROPRIATED OR SHOULD ANY ACCOUNTABILITY EXPECTATIONS RATES ARE ADDRESSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND WE THINK BOTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND AND SURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED ACCORDING TO LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WE HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS ON HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ADOPT REPORTING LANGUAGE. AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ON THAT AND ALSO HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WELCOME REPORTING IS A BIG THING FOR ME. FOLKS IN THE OTHER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR SIX YEARS OF LISTEN TO MY LECTURE BUT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND METRIC SO. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THAT -- LET ME ASK A QUESTION AND THEN -- MA'AM I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME SLIDES. DO WE KNOW WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES -- BY -- MINORITY GROUP -- OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH ACADEMIC PREPARATION. WHEN THEY COME INTO THE UNIVERSITY AND THEY'RE BEING FEWER PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM WITH TUTORING AND MENTORING AVAILABLE IF YOU SEE -- RUBY APPS NOW IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO GO INTO MY SLIDES AND TALK ABOUT HOW I WOULD SPEND THESE FUNDS AND THEN THE AND THEN OF COURSE I WILL AT SOME POINT I WANT. TO MY RECOLLECTION IS THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM -- CHESTER TIM WHITE TO IS IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM WITH RESPECT TO REMEDIAL COURSES AND AND ESSENTIALLY IS MAINSTREAMING. STUDENTS INTO MAINSTREAM COURSES WITH APPROPRIATE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE I ASSUME THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON WHETHER THAT WORKS OR NOT. AND MY QUESTION TO YOU AT SOME POINT WILL BE AS YOU SEE CONSIDERING -- SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE WE'RE CONSIDERING OUR OWN FORM OF OF SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS NOT REMEDIAL COURSES BUT OUT OF GO INTO THAT IN A LITTLE BIT -- LET YOU GET BACK ON TRACK THAT AND I'LL SHUT UP GREAT -- RATE THAT YOU LET ME GET BACK ON TRACK -- OUR REQUEST FOR NINETEEN TWENTY SIX TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE pSORTS OF DEGREE COMPLETION EFFORTS WHAT WE'RE CALLING OUR STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVE -- WE ONE OF THE REGIONS HAVE SET THE OVERALL GOALS BY -- TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THE SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE A 90% OVERALL SIX YOUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION TRANSFER STUDENTS GRADUATION RATES. WE WANT TO CLOSE THE GRADUATION GAPS WERE PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. AND WE WANT TO CLOSE OVERALL DEGREE AND AND GAPS FOR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS UNDER REPRESENTS STUDENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND WOMEN. AS PART OF THESE GOALS CAMPUSES IDENTIFIED A NETWORK OF OVER ARCHING CAMPUS STRATEGY SOME PROGRAMS TO HELP WITH UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE ATTAINMENT STRATEGIES. INCLUDING PRE MATRICULATION PROGRAMS TEACHING AND LEARNING CENTER STUDENT ADVISING HOLISTIC APPROACHES THE STUDENT SUCCESS AND INTEGRATING CO CURRICULAR SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. WHAT YOU SEE ON FLIGHT TWENTY SIX IS OUR LATEST FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES -- THIS IS FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO STARTED AS FRESHMAN IN FALL TWENTY FOURTEEN SO THEY JUST GRADUATED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND YOU WILL SEE THERE ON THE LEFT THE PELL GRANT AND NO -- NON PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS -- GRADUATION RATES WE'RE ON SLIDE TWENTY SIX AND FELL GRANTS ARE OFTEN USES A METRIC FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER RENTAL INCOME AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE THERE IS STILL AN ELEVEN POINT GAP BETWEEN THOSE STUDENTS. WHEN STUDENTS STAY LONGER SOME OF THE IMPACTS ARE THERE TAKING UP A SEAT ANOTHER STUDENT CAN COME INTO? OF AND ALSO THEY'RE TAKING ON MORE PERSONAL LOANS BECAUSE AFTER CAL GRANT BEGINS TO RUN OUT AFTER FOUR YEARS. THE UNIVERSITY STEPS IN AND A FIFTY YEAR TO PROVIDE THEM WITH TUITION ASSISTANCE TO OUR FINANCIAL AID. BUT THEN -- THAT THIS THE FINANCIAL AID BEGINS TO RUN OUT AND STUDENTS BEGIN TO HAVE TO RELY ON LOANS -- SO WE WANT TO GET THEM GRADUATED FASTER SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT THOSE LOANS IF THEY'RE STAYING LONGER BECAUSE OF KNOWING WHICH COURSES TO TAKE. TO DO THE REMEDIAL COURSES KEEP THEM. ON CAMPUS LONGER. WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY REMEDIAL COURSES BUT YES IT'S OFTEN REPEATING COURSES NOT REALIZING WHAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE AND THAT'S THERE IN LIES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM AND THE ADMISSION. PRACTICES THERE AND YOU SEIZE YOUR STUDENTS GENERALLY COME TO YOU BECAUSE OF A THROUGH G.. QUALIFIED TO STEP RIGHT INTO THE ENGLISH ONE OH ONE OR MATH. ONE SOON YES THAT'S CORRECT OUR STUDENTS ARE THE TAPPED TOP TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE SO THERE ARE COME TO US BETTER PREPARED. SO THE SIX YEAR ISSUE. IN PRT HAS TO DO WITH I GUESS YOU MENTION REPEATING CHORUSES AND NON AVAILABILITY OF COURSE IS NOT A NON AVAILABILITY OF COURSES THEY NEED FOR THEIR MAJOR TO GRADUATE WHAT WE CALL BOTTOM THE COURSES. SO THOSE COURSES THAT END UP HAVING A LONG WAIT LISTED THEN STUDENTS. AND OF NOT GETTING THE CLASS AND THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT TERM IN ORDER TO TAKE IT CONSUMER INTEREST IN ONLINE. AND YOUR INTEREST AND PERHAPS PERHAPS UTILIZING ONLINE. COURSE WORK TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE BOTTLE NECK WERE WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE OF WHERE WE ARE DEVELOPING OUR ONLINE CURRICULA -- EXPANDING THE OFFERINGS TO STUDENTS AND WE ARE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING ON THAT ROUTE. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- THE BEST KIND IN THE CLASSROOM FACE TO FACE WITH THE FACULTY MEMBER -- IF WE CAN. WE CAN AFFORD TO HERD OF FACULTY MEMBERS. IN PARTICULAR AND YOU CAN FIND THEM IN PARTICULAR FIELDS TO RELIEVE THE BOTTLENECK COURSES OTHERWISE WE MAY HAVE. TO SOMETIMES SECOND BEST IS. GOOD ENOUGH OF WE DEFINITELY WANT TO CONTINUE. TO DEVELOP MORE ONLINE COURSES AS WELL AND DO WE KNOW WHETHER THE SIX YEAR PROBLEM OR BEYOND IS IS CAUSED IN PART BY CHANGES IN MAJORS. SOME OF IT IS I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA IN FRONT OF ME WE I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW GRANULAR OUR DATA GOES IF WE CAN SEE. IF THE STUDENTS CHANGED MAJORS -- I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO OUR DATA FOLKS TO FIND OUT TO WHAT EVEL% OF DETAIL WE CAN GET ON THAT. HENCE THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN THE LONGITUDINAL STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM OR WHATEVER IT'S A VERY EXCITING PROPOSAL. THE STRUCTURED CORRECTLY COULD GIVE DEFINITELY GOOD DATA I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE PLEASE. THANK YOU ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE FRESHMAN CORE HER TO ENTERED IN FALL TWENTY FOURTEEN BROKEN DOWN BY ETHNICITY. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE REMAIN GAPS IN THE GRADUATION CAPS -- GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN OOPS WITHIN YOU SEE. THE REGION'S WANT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT ALLOUR STUDENTS HAVE THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MATTER. GRADUATING FASTER USUALLY MEANS LESS DEATH AND STUDENTS ARE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON IN NINETEEN TWENTY A PORTION OF THE REQUESTED SIXTY MILLION WOULD BE USED TO HIRE. THIRTY SEVEN FACULTY THAT WERE SHOWN ON SLIDE TWENTY ONE YOU DON'T NEED TO GO BACK BUT THERE WERE TWO ROWS AND AS THE STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES THIRTY SEVEN FACULTY WOULD BE HIRED IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH THESE FUNDS THE SIXTY MILLION. OF THESE ADDITIONAL LOTTERING FACULTY WILL BE NEEDED TO HELP ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF GRADUATING STUDENTS FASTER PARTICULAR WITH FIRST YEAR PROGRAMMING CURRICULAR INNOVATIONS. pSUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT ON THE CAMPUS STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. STUDENT SERVICES AND ENSURE THAT ACADEMICALLY STUDENTS STAY ON TRACK -- SO SLIDE TWENTY SEVEN INCLUDES A BREAKDOWN OF HOW WE WOULD SPEND -- SPEND THE FUNDING FOR THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU'LL SEE WE HAVE VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF WHERE. SYSTEM WIDE INTENDING TO SPEND THE FUNDS ON ADVISING AND HIRING NEW FACULTY ARE THE LARGEST OF THE TWO MAKING CERTAIN THAT STUDENTS KNOW WHICH CLASSES THEY NEED TO TAKE UNDERSTAND WHICH CLASSES CAN BE SWAPPED OUT FOR WHICH ONES. AND SO FORTH. AND THEN ON SLIDE TWENTY EIGHT I GIVE YOUR KIND OF A BUSY SLIDE BUT SAMPLING OF WHAT THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES WOULD DO. IF THEY RECEIVED THESE FINDS THAT THEY TOLD US THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR PLANS. SOME OF THESE THINGS INCLUDE -- THING AND COHORTS WHERE YOU HAVE A SMALLER GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN PEER TO PEER MENTORING. AND TAKE COURSES TOGETHER AND WE'RE FINDINGTHAT THIS MAY BE AN APPROACH -- TO HELP FIRST YEAR AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS FEEL MORE ACCEPTED IN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING BY HAVING THIS CALL HER TO HELP THEM. TAKE CLASSES THEY WOULD STUDY TOGETHER THEY WOULD BE IN THE VARIOUS COURSES TOGETHER A MOVE TO THE PROGRAMS -- AS A UNIT AND I WOULD HELP CREATE SOME COHESION WITH THEM -- A LOT OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT ON ADDITIONAL ADVISING. ADDITIONAL DATA TRACKING TOOLS THAT WOULD HELLO ADVISERS WHEN A STUDENT STOPS TAKING THE COURSES THEY NEED. FOR THEIR MAJOR -- THAT WOULD HELP THE ADVISER IDENTIFY THAT STUDENT BEING PERSONAL CONTACT AND LET THE STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO GET BACK ON TRACK ACADEMICALLY. HOW ARE YOU -- WILL THERE BE A SEE IF I CAN ASK A QUESTION. WILL THERE BE A TALKING ABOUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND AND ANALYSIS. PROCESS WHERE THESE VARIOUS NEW PROGRAMS COULD BE ANALYZED IN THE BEST OF THEM. SORT OF RANKED IN DECISIONS MADE AS TO WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE AND WHICH SHOULD NOT. I WOULD ASSUME THAT. SOME OF THESE MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS. I WOULD ASSUME SO SIR SIR AS WELL -- WE WERE AT THE MOMENT LONG LOOK INTO THE CAMPUSES TO DO THEIR OWN INTERNAL ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL. BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT THE UNIVERSITY COULD COME BACK AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHICH ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS COULD BE REPLICATED SYSTEM WIDE AND WHICH ONES HAD A REAL IMPACT. WELL -- THE REASON I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION IS I MEAN IT COULD VERY WELL BE FOR EXAMPLE THAT [inaudible] BERKELEY'S PROGRAM. INCREASING ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND CETERA AND THE WAY THE BERKELEY IS STRUCTURES THAT ULTIMATELY -- IS BETTER THAN THE ONE THE PROGRAM THAT SAN DIEGO PUT IN PLAY IT PUTS IN PLACE FOR STUDENT SUCCESS IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES. AND SAN DIEGO MAYBE NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AT BERKELEY'S PROGRAM. OR VICE VERSA HEAVEN FORBID RIVERSIDE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA THAN BERKELEY WELL THEN WE WOULD TAKE RIVERSIDE IS THAT MAKES SENSE YES IT MAKES SENSE TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND SEE WHICH HOW HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED. THAT MAY HAVE MADE THE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN A DIFFERENT MATTER OF STRUCTURING A SIMILAR PROGRAM RIGHT IN THE MILITARY WE CALL IT CROSS FEED BUT I DON'T KNOW. YOU YOU WOULD CROSS FEED YOUR PROGRAMS AND SO PEOPLE COULD CHERRY PICK THE BEST ONES AND STEAL THEM AND PUT THEM IN PLACE INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT THEY TRIED AND PERHAPS WEREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL. OF WE'D BE HAPPY TO COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH -- METRICS AND WITHIN A SOUTH WORK GOOD IDEA THESE LOOK LIKE GOOD IDEAS. THANK YOU. THE NET NEXT ITEM IS THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA. A LOOK THE FINANCE WHEN WE TAKE A FIVE MINUTE BREAK AND THEN COME BACK AND WE'LL PICK UP WITH THE ISSUE NUMBER [inaudible] FIVE EXTENDED EDUCATION ENDED EDUCATION. YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES EASY WITH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND AND PILOT DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE OR DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS AND EXPENSE TICKET PROGRAMS EXTENSION CENTERS. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE SOME CLLEGE BERNARD GREED. AND THE MISSION ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS TO CONNECT TO STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION SO THEY CAN RECEIVE A DEGREE CERTIFICATE OR OTHER POTENTIAL TO THRIVE ACCESS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACHIEVE GREATER SUCCESS. THANK YOU. WELL HOLD MY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ILIO. WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONCERNS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND ALL RACE THREE CONCERNS FOR THE COMMITTEE. THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL LACKS A LOT OF SPECIFICS. ON HOW THE FUND TO BE SPENT THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT THE FRONT IS HERE AND IT SEEMS BASED ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS INDICATED THAT THE KEY PRIORITY FOR THE FUNDS WOULD BE TO CREATE NEW BACK. BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE THE MISSION MINISTRATION NOTES OTHER ACTIVITIES THOSE SUCH AS OUT REACH. AN EXPANDING CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AND THOSE ARE VERY ALL DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT POTENTIALLY GO TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT ISSUES. WITHOUT MORE SPECIFICITY ON THE USE OF THE FUNDS IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDS WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND ALSO IT'S DIFFICULT. TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE PROPOSED FUNDING LEVELS EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION RIGHT INFORMATION. OF IT'S STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE. USE THE EXTENSION IS A SELF SUPPORTING ENTERPRISE AND PART OF A U. C. EXTENSION CENTERS. OF REGULAR OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS TO PLAN FOR AND DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS. AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A COMPELLING CASE THAT MORE STATE FUNDING IS IS NEEDED. TO CREATE THESE NEW PROGRAMS. THIRD. WE KNOW THAT CS YOU ALSO ALREADY HAS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH EXTENDED EDUCATION. AND THAT RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR US WITH THESE PROPOSED NEW PROGRAMS BE DUPLICATIVE WOULD THEY BE ADDING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT SEES YOU PROGRAMS OFFER. AND WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF EXPANDING PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE INSTEAD OF CS YOU WHERE IS THAT THERE ARE MORE -- NINE COMPUTERS FROM CS YOU GIVEN THAT THEY ENROLL MORE STUDENTS AND HAVE LOWER GRADUATION RATES. GIVEN THESE QUESTIONS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL FOR THIS YEAR. AND WHILE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK BY THE NEXT YEAR AND LATER TIME WITH A MORE FLESHED OUT PROPOSAL. WHAT -- ME I WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL LET ME OF I WENT HAD DIFFICULT -- FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE MINISTRATION FOR GOT SOME VERY VERY BOLD -- CONCEPTS AND IDEAS IN THIS BUDGET I THINK IT'S REFRESHING AND THEY'RE ALL AREAS THAT NEED. TO NEED TO HAVE -- DISCUSSION AND FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR -- ONE I WAS UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE IN GAME. IS OR IS TO BE IS IT IS IT TO GET TO GET A A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS IT. TO ATTAIN A SKILL LEVEL -- BECAUSE THE NOTE I MADE TO MYSELF ON THE AGENDA. ISN'T THIS REALLY THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM INDOOR. C. T. E. N. THE EDUCATIONAL CONSORTIA THAT WE'VE STRUCTURED IN ANOTHER SETTING. TO FOCUS ON THE DEMAND SIDE JOBS AND SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED AND DESIGN TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THE GOAL HERE IS THE OTHER MANY STUDENTS THAT -- THAT BUT LEAVE THE SCENE THEY HAVE QUITE A FEW AN INSTANT AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY ARE NOW OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PROGRAMS THERE ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS THAT. FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE WORKING -- TO COME BACK AND COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE I MEAN IT'S NO SECRET THAT SETS THE WORKERS WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREES SIR FOR ASSISTANCE WITH OTHER CERTIFICATES. FOR MORE THAN STUDENTS WITHOUT THEM SO THE GOAL IS TO CREATE THE GET THOSE CREDENTIALS AND THEN SEEK HIGHER PAIRED PLACEMENT. SO THAT'S DOWN THE PASSAGE GREECE SIDE THERE IS A LARGE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE FIVE BELIEVE IT'S GREATER THAN A IN TWO YEARS OF STEVE UNITS I THINK HE SEES MENTION THAT PREVIOUS HEARINGS OR OTHER VENUES -- AND ON THE CERTIFICATE SIDE. UC'S EXTENSION PRESENTERS OFFER NUMBER CERTIFICATES -- THIS ISN'T PARTICULARLY -- AND A NEW ROUND FOR FREE SIX TENSION CENTERS OF PERSONS WITH PERHAPS WITH FEAR UNITS. MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND -- ANOTHER CREDENTIAL THAT MAYBE NOT BE AS EXTENSIVE AS RASHES DEGREE BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE SKILLS AND EDUCATION THAT COULD BE CAPTURED AND AND SORT OF RECOGNIZE THROUGH CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. WELL I'LL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR -- UC'S PERSPECTIVE -- INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE HAS A SORT OF A WRIST RETURN TO SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR SOMEONE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON. IS IN UC DAVIS FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN RUNS OUT OF MONEY OR HAS FAMILY ISSUES. CAUSES THEM. TO LEAVE THE PROGRAM IN THE CAMPUS IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A SYSTEM IN PLACE. TO TO BRING THAT STUDENT BACK INTO THE UC SYSTEM TO ALLOW. DEGREE COMPLETION OF NUMBER ONE IN IF THE YOU SEE EXTENSION. PROGRAM WITH VARIOUS CAMPUSES IS REALLY THE PROPER PLACE FOR THIS SORT OF RETURN TO SCHOOL AND GET YOUR DEGREE -- PROGRAM OUR CONCEPT OF THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS. HOPEFULLY THE ANSWERS ARE BURIED IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO. HOPEFULLY AND IF NOT I WILL ADDRESS THEM -- WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THIS ITEM -- WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A ROLE -- IN DEGREE COMPLETION FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEFT WITHOUT DEGREES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS LEFT YOU SEE WITH NO DEGREE. ONLY ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF THOSE GO ON TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION LATER TO COMPLETE A DEGREE. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO HELP THESE FORMER STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES AND BEGIN EARNING HIGHER SALARIES AFTER ABOUT FIVE YEARS A GRADUATION -- UC STUDENTS ARE EARNING FAR HIGHER SALARIES THAN THOSE WHO NEVER GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING THE PLAN FOR HOW WE WOULD. EXACTLY RUN THIS PROGRAM THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DID NOT ORIGINALLY ASSOC ORIGINATE WITH OUR REGIONS BUT WE ARE. DEBATING A PILE THE DESIGN FOR DEGREE COMPLETION FOR UC STUDENTS. OF WITH POTENTIAL EXPANSION TO OTHER INSTITUTE STUDENTS WHO DROPPED OUT OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS BUT WE WOULDFOCUS ON YOU SEE STUDENTS INITIALLY -- WE WOULD DO A CROSSING THE FINISH LINE PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE VERY FEW COURSES TO GO -- AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE THE LA -- SENT OFF FOR EXPANDED CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS FOR GREATER EMPLOYEE ABILITY TO GO WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. TOTE KIND OF PAIRED THE TWO UP EITHER EX EXISTING OR NEW CERTIFICATE STUFF WE WOULD CREATE. SO THAT PEOPLE -- WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO REENTER THE WORKFORCE. OF THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR OUTREACH TO FORMER UC STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED A DEGREE -- IT WILL BE USED FOR HIGH TOUCH STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT SO A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE ADVISER AND STUDENT -- AND FINANCIAL AID TO NEEDY STUDENTS TO PAY FOR THESE YOU SEE EXTENSION COURSES. SO ON SLIDE ON THIRTY YOU SEE A BIT ABOUT WHO THESE STUDENTS ARE WHO LEAVE WITHOUT A DEGREE -- AND IT WAS QUITE SURPRISING TO ME PERSONALLY TO SEE. THAT 36% OF THOSE WHO DROP OUT DROP OFF WITH A HUNDRED UNITS OR MORE COMPLETED. A YOU SEE YOU NEED USUALLY ABOUT HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREE UNITS TO COMPLETE A DEGREE SO THE STUDENTS REPRESENT LOW HANGING FRUIT TO BRING THEM BACK. AND HAVE THEM COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES AND START PAYING -- MORE TAXES A STATE GOT BETTER PAYING JOBS. UP IN TERMS OF YOU SEE HAVING ALREADY A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WE IF A STUDENT TAKES DROPS OUT AND COMES BACK WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME I BELIEVE IT'S TWO YEARS. THEY CAN BE READMITTED THAT OUR CAMPUS OF ORIGIN. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A READMISSION PROGRAM WHO HAVE BEEN GONE. FOR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS -- THEY WOULD NEED TO APPLY THE UC CAMPUS AS A REGULAR UNDERGRADUATE. ADMIT WHICH IS HARDER FOR AN OLDER STUDENT -- TO DO THAT [inaudible] AND HARDER PARTLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO FINANCIAL AID ASSOCIATED AND ALSO WE WOULD JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PRIOR GPA -- SO BY BRINGING THEM IN FOR EXTENSION HAVING THEM TAKE -- EXTENSION COURSES -- AND SHOW THAT THEY CAN EARN. GOOD GRADES WE WOULD THEN TRANSFER THOSE UNITS ON TO THE CAMPUS. AND HAVE THE CAMPUS OF MAJOR GRANT THEM THE DEGREE WAS AS I SIT HERE. I MEAN I CAN THINK OF SOME I WAS WONDERING WHY YOU SEE EXTENSION BUT I CAN THINK OF SOME. DEFINITE ADVANTAGES FOR THE TYPE OF STUDENT GROUP THAT YOU'RE. HOPING TO HELP HERE. THE COURSES ARE GENERALLY TAUGHT IN THE EVENINGS. SO FOR SOMEONE WHO'S WORKING. FOR TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY THERE MAY BE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK IN AND COMPLETE THE COURSEBECAUSE OF THE EVENING STRUCTURE OF UC EXTENSION. BUT I'M WONDERING DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA FOR THESE STUDENTS WHO LEAVE. I MEAN ARE THERE CERTAIN COMMON COURSES THAT THEY LACK HOW HOW WOULD YOU DESIGN A OF A PROGRAM INSIDE OF YOU SEE EXTENSION TO ADDRESS [inaudible] VARIED [inaudible] ACADEMIC NEEDS. AM I MAKING YES YOU'RE MAKING SENSOR -- WE HAVE NOT YET CONSIDERED THIS I HAVEN'T SEEN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR AMONG THE STUDENTS. OTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF UNITS THEY COMPLETED PRIOR TO LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE WELL I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THE PLAN YET BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE COST STRUCTURE IN THE THE FINANCES OF ALL OF THIS USE THE EXTENSION IS. MUCH DIFFERENT. AND OPERATES IN A MUCH DIFFERENT WAY. OBLIQUE FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT INSIDE THE UC ORGANIZATION. FROM WHAT THE STUDENTS PAY TO GET IN WHAT THEY PAY TO GET THEIR CERTIFICATE OR THEIR PROGRAM MUCH DIFFERENT THAN. THE TRADITIONAL UC CAMPUS COURSE THINK YES USUALLY THE EXTENSION COURSES ARE SELF SUPPORTING MEANING THATTHEY HAVE TO THE FEES CHARGED THE STUDENTS HAVE TO COVER ALL OF THE EXPENDITURES OF RUNNING THAT EXTENSION PROGRAM. THE REASON YOU SEE EXTENSION WAS SELECTED AS THAT THEY DO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUTREACH CURRENTLY. TO TRY AND PULL IN STUDENTS INTO THESE EVENING PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY WHO IS A STUDENT POPULATION WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS -- THE CAMPUS DEPARTMENTS TWO STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE STATEWIDE AND HAVE DROPPED OUT ALSO USE THE EXTENSION IS WHERE WE RUN A LOT OF ONLINE COURSES OUT OF SO MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE. THE DATE THEY RUN THEY OPERATE A LOT OF THE PLATFORMS THEY DO A LOT OF THE CONTRACTING TO DEVELOP THE COURSES. AND THE MAINTENANCE -- IS DONE. BY EXTENSION FOR VARIOUS. PROGRAMS ALREADY FOR ONLINE SO IF WE WERE TO USE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO OFFER THE STUDENTS OF WAY TO COMPLETE THEIR COURSES. EXTENSION WOULD ALREADY HAVE SOME OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. AND IT'S A MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS. NO LONGER CUSTOM TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ON A CAMPUS AND FIND A PARKING SPACE AND THAT'S CORRECT IFSOMEBODY -- HAS A FULL TIME DAY JOB IN A COUPLE OF KIDS THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE. THREE HOURS OFF ON A TUESDAY IN ORDER TO COME AND ATTEND A COURSE. IN CONVINCING MYSELF. WE WE WILL BRING YOU UP A REVISED PROPOSAL AS AS IT. BECOMES MORE DEVELOPED WHERE REQUESTING YOUR CONSIDERATION I LOOK FORWARD TO IS TO SEEING THIS I MEAN I SEE THE NEED AND I'M I'M NOW. TALKING MYSELF INTO THE THE WHY OF UC EXTENSION I CAN SEE SOME DEFINITE ADVANTAGES FOR USING THAT -- THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM AND FACILITY TO TRY TO BRING PEOPLE BACK WHO. MAY BE RELUCTANT TO COME BACK INTO CAMPUS EXPERIENCE I ASSUME RIVERSIDE FOR EXAMPLE IS OFTEN IS OFF CAMPUS. AND I ASSUMES OTHER CAMPUSES MAY BE OFF CAMPUS AS WELL SO IT'S A MUCH MORE FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT -- FOR THE OCCASIONAL STUDENT. THAT'S CORRECT SIR. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE ON ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS STUDENT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- THE UC'S BUDGET PROPOSAL CALLED SPECIFICALLY FOR NET FOR FINANCIAL AID. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS BROADER ALIGN THE YOUSIF -- THE ABILITY TO USE THESE FUNDS TO SUPPORT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED FOR THE HUNGER FOR CAMPUS INITIATIVES THAT THAT IS FOOD PANTRIES -- MILL SHARING PROGRAMS CAL FRESH TOWARD NATION TO GET STUDENTS ENROLLED IN BENEFITS -- AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO HOUSE HOMELESS STUDENTS AND HOUSING AND SECURE STUDENTS. I AM AS WELL AS THEIR INITIAL PROPOSAL. AS YOU HERE FOR A MINUTE FROM YOU SEE THE UNIVERSITY IS CURRENTLY DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS IS IT AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE SOME. FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS WOULD SUPPORT FINANCIAL LATER FOOD AND HOUSING INITIATIVES OR A MIX OF THE TWO AND YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY. GENERALLY WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON ON WHERE THEY'RE AT IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE WE HAVE SOME ISSUES FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS IT'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS TO THINK ABOUT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATES OF EACH EACH OF OUR FOOD SECURITY AT UC OTHER ROUGHLY COMPARABLE TO RATES THAT ARE REPORTED BY THE OTHER TWO SEGMENTS YES YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THEY'RE MUCH HIGHER THAN UP INSECURITY FOR THE STATE POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE. ENDED ACCORDING TO YOU SEE BETWEEN SECURITIES VERY PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE STUDENT BODY FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHO COME FROM HOUSEHOLDS EARNING A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE A YEAR ALSO REPORT FOOD SECURITY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEM REPORT THAT. SO IF YOU APPEAR TO BE VERY PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT -- THE STUDENT BODY. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF CAUSES BEHIND THIS WOULDN'T SECURITY COULD RANGE FROM. LACK OF RESOURCES TO PERHAPS LACK OF AWARENESS OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL AID AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COVER COSTS. STUDENTS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD COULD ALSO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT'S ASSUMED AND YOU SEE IS A MODEL FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY -- BAR LESSER WORK LAST WERE -- PREFER TO CONTRIBUTE CLASS -- ARE ARE HAVE HIGHER COSTS THAN MOTORISTS SOON WHO IS WE WE KNOW THE PERCENTAGES BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY RIGHT EXACTLY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES. IS IT STILL A BIT OF A BLACK BOX AT LEAST IN OUR REVIEW OF THE DATA. PERHAPS YOU SEE WILL HAVE -- SOME BETTER INFORMATION ON THAT AND HOW TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION DO YOU PROVIDE MORE FINANCIALLY DO YOU EXPAND FOOD AND HOUSING. AN INITIATIVE DO YOU PROVIDE FINANCIAL LITERACY COURSES ALL THESE ADDRESS KIND OF DIFFERENT CAUSES AND SO WITHOUT REALLY HAVING A FULLER PICTURE OF THAT IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS -- THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN FINANCIAL AID AND FOOD AND HOUSING INITIATIVES ON THE CAMPUSES. THE SECOND ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS -- KIND OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN FINANCIAL AID IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. USUALLY DOESN'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON SOON PARTICIPATION IN CAL FRESH FOR EXAMPLE BUT SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THERE THERE COULD BE OTHER STUDENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND ARE CURRENTLY DOING SO. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AND THE FIRST OF HALF OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU SEE REPORTS THAT IT AND ROLLED OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ON THE CAL FRESH. NOT SUGGEST THAT THERE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO MAYBE WEREN'T AWARE THAT THEY COULD ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS AND SO. GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON THAT COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE ASSESS WHETHER IT SHOULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THROUGH FINANCIAL LATER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR SOME MIX OF THAT. THE THIRD ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS -- RIGHT NOW YOU SEE PROVIDES -- SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AMOUNT OF AID FOR LIVING COSTS THAN US YES YOU IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THAT MEANS THAT STUDENTS TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEE IF YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BORROW MORE OR WORKING LONGER HOURS TO COVER COSTS. AND IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDS. FOR FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY AT UC BUT ONE TIME FUNDS FOR C. AS YOU AND DOESN'T HAVE AN ASSOCIATED PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALTHOUGH IT IS AS YOU'LL HEAR IN A LATER SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING THERE IS A PROPOSAL -- REGARDING -- CAL GRANTS THAT LARGELY AFFECTS A PORTION OF STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THAT ADDRESS THE FUNDS MOVE GREATER LIVING COSTS THROUGH FINANCIAL AID. AND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT SHOULD PRIORITIZE ON GOING. WHERE THEY'RE? FINANCIALLY AS GREAT AS FOR EXAMPLE AT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ONE WAY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN ONE TOOL JUST LIKE YOUR HOUSE IS AT ITS DISPOSABLE DISPOSAL FUSE ME. IS THE CAL GRANT BE AXIS AWARD WHICH COVERS LIVING COSTS PRIMARILY FOR STUDENTS AT CSUN COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THERE'S SOME ISSUES TO CONSIDER IS REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL. AND THEN OF COURSE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL FOR FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR A FEW YEARS YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE KELLGREN ENTITLEMENT IN YOUR IN THE COMPETITIVE POOL IN THEIR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO. APPLICANTS IN. TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET IT SO SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE ON A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IF THEY ALL GO. EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T GET KELLGREN ASSISTANTS WHO WERE FLOATING AROUND WITH IT WITHOUT ANY FINANCIAL AID. I GUESS. THAT THAT IS TRUE THAT -- IF YOU WHICH IF YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR AN ENTITLEMENT AND YOU HAVE TO YOU'RE SORT OF LEFT IN THAT COMPETITIVE POOL THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO TELL. EXPAND THAT A LIMIT OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING BUT YES -- THERE MANY STUDENTS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR ENTITLEMENT ARE LEFT. TO WITH THOSE ARE LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE WORDS WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY. CONTRIBUTES TO FOOD AND SECURITY. IF YOU THOUGHT OF FINANCIAL AID AND YOU NEED. OKAY THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE HOPEFULLY WE CAN DRILL DOWN AND GET SOME DATA AS TO WHY. I WAS SHOCKED BY THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY THE PERCENTAGES -- OF THOSE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING FOOD IN SECURITY AND OF THE 26% OF FRESHMEN WITH FAMILY INCOMES ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY REALLY SHOCKED ME SO. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHY. YOU SEE. OF WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- I WANTED TO GO LITTLE BIT OVER HOW WE CAME UP WITH THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR. AMOUNT. IF WE HAD RAISED TUITION THE FIFTEEN MILLION IS THE AMOUNT OF WOULD HAVE GONE TO FINANCIAL AID OUT OF THAT AMOUNT SO THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE NUMBER. FIFTEEN A MILLION AND YOU'LL HEAR PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS SOMETIMES A FINANCIAL AID PROPOSAL. SINCE WE SUBMIT THAT PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY OF OUR STUDENTS AND THE ODD THE REGIONS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THIS. ITEM THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND HAVE WANTED. TO HAVE IT AND HAVE IT INSTEAD BE DISTRIBUTED ON THE CAMPUSES AS DIRECT AID TO STUDENTS EITHER. AS EMERGENCY HOUSING ASSISTANCE OR FOOD BANKS STOCKING TO FOOD BANKS FOR THE CAMPUSES -- TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE REQUESTING -- EMERGENCY AID RECEIVE IT AT THE MOMENT SO. THAT'S THE THAT'S DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN WITHTHOSE PLANS A LIKE A GOOD PLAN -- WE WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE STUDENTS BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THESE FUNDS THAT'S WHAT THE UNIVERSITY ONCE -- AS DEALIO -- ALREADY REVIEWED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAD THIS STUDENT EXPERIENCE SURVEY THAT FOUND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF STUDENT HUNGER WHERE FOR SYNDICATED OR SKIPPING A MEAL AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH SOME ANYMORE -- BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO PURCHASE FOOD. SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE WE HAVE YOU SEE HAS A VERY GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE WHERE FROM FOREST STUDENTS WE ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH LIVING ALLOWANCE -- LIVING ALONE LIVING AID. HOWEVER -- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MONEY TO GO AROUND SO -- STUDENTS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO WORK OR BORROW. FOR AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL COSTS. AND THAT CREATES A BURDEN FOR SOME STUDENTS WHO. STRUGGLE WITH -- BALANCING WORK AND SCHOOL AND WHO DON'T WANT TO BORROW SO SO WE DO KNOW WE DO KNOW THE BASIS FOR THE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FOOD AND SECURITY IS LACK OF LACK OF MONEY. THAT'S WHAT THE STUDENTS INDICATED THEMSELVES YES. AND WHILE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS N MANY PLACES WOULD SEEM LIKE EXTREMELY WEALTHY PARENTS. IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY LIVING AREAS. HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS ODD NOT. CONSIDERED CALLS WILL HAVE THEIR INCOME LOCKED UP IN PAYING OFF A MORTGAGE. AND THEN GIVING A CHILD THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR TO GO TO UC THIRTY FOUR BEING -- THE FEES AND LIVING COSTS TO GATHER. ODD THAT OUR PARENT OF WITH MAKING A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MAY BE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE THEY MAY BE A LITTLE LATE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AS WELL. WHICH WOULD ALLEVIATE THAT COST BUT THEY'RE STILL A SIGNIFICANT COST FOR THE FAMILY. AND SO PERHAPS THE STUDENT IS NOT WANTING TO ASK THEIR PARENTS FOR THE FULL AMOUNT IF THERE ARE OTHER THINGS GOING ON LIKE THE PARENTS ARE SUPPORTING MULTIPLE KIDS AT THE SAME TIME OR SO. SO ABSOLUTELY I WAS IN MINIMIZING THE ISSUE I THINK IT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE AND IT'S AN ISSUE WE NEED TO ADDRESS. SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD PROVIDE US WITH FIFTEEN MILLION ON GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS -- WE ALL HAVE NOW TAKEN A LOT OF ACTIONS TO START ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES BUT THE ACTIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN TAKEN WITH ONE TIME FUNDS -- THE PRESIDENT ALLOCATED ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SYSTEM WIDE STARTING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT THAT WAS ONE TIME MONEY THAT'S BEEN SPENT. AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WITH TWO POINT FIVE MILLION AND IN THE CURRENT YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WITH A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN ONE TIME FUNDS WE USE THEM TO BUY -- FOOD BANKS ON CAMPUSES TO SET UP A STUDENT FOOD BANKS WE SET UP A PROCESS WHERE STUDENTS ARE WHO HAVE A MEAL PLAN CAN DONATE THEIR UNUSED MEALS. TO STUDENTS WHO EXPRESS NEED AND THE STUDENT WHO THEN CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR A MEAL JUST COASTER GOES TO THE CAFE AND ARE THE COSTS OF THE OF STUDENT -- DORMITORY EATERY AND WITH THEIR VERIFIED PAPERWORK GTS GETS DOES FREE MEALS. IT'S AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM HOW'S THAT WORKING WE HAVE HAD -- LAST YEAR FORTY THOUSAND MEALS WERE DONATED. SO THAT THAT'S HELPED. ALLEVIATE HUNGER TREMENDOUSLY. RESTORES MY FAITH IN. SOCIETY YES IT'S OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY IS ALIVE YES. YES EVEN AMONG OUR POOR STUDENTS WHO. WHO ARE STRUGGLING -- THAT THEY ARE LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING -- NOT ONLY ARE WE PLANNING ON ADDRESSING STUDENT HUNGER -- BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO TACKLE STUDENT HOMELESSNESS DISTURBINGLY OUR STUDENT SURVEY FOUND A 5% OF STUDENTS SAID THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HOMELESS AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE TIMES. THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS 5% MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT WE HAVE. A TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THE 5% OUT. DOESN'T UP BEING A LOT. AND WE HAVE A PLAN TO SOME SLIGHT THIRTY TWO YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HOUSED IN OUR DORMITORIES ON ON CAMPUS HOUSING -- WHILE WE ARE HOUSING 37% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATES CURRENTLY WE ALSO -- BEFORE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ON A WAIT LIST TO GET INTO A DORMITORY. THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS -- SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE COST OF LIVING NEAR MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES IS EXTREMELY HIGH. FOR EXAMPLE UCLA BORDERS ELLIS ANGELUS NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED BELLAIRE WHERE THE AVERAGE HOUSE PRICES THIRTY MILLION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT LOOKING DIFFERENT A SPARE BEDROOM TO A UNIVERSITY STUDENT THAT RESTRICTS THE AVAILABLE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE FOR STUDENTS -- ON SLIDE THIRTY THREE YOU WILL SEE OUR STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE. WHICH BY TWENTY THREE WE HAVE NOW EXPANDED AND BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BETWEEN NOW AND SO BETWEEN FALL TWENTY SIXTEEN AND FALL. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE PLANNING AND HAVE ALREADY CONSTRUCTED SOME BUT ARE PLANNING ON CONSTRUCTING THIRTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENT BEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO THE LET THAT ENTIRE WAITLIST INTO STUDENT HOUSING AND THEN. MAKE CERTAIN THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM HAVE AFFORDABLE SAFE HOUSING WHERE THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEIR PEERS AND BE CLOSE TO THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] SHOW. IS ACCESS TO STUDENT HOUSING. PRIOR BASED ON NEED. CURRENTLY I IT'S PRIORITIZED BASED ON FRESHMAN STATUS SO UNDERGRADUATES FRESHMAN GOT ACCESS FIRST AND SOFT MOORE'S. AND THAT BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT BASED ON NEED AS FAR AS I KNOW. I WAS JUST CURIOUS. IF THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER AND SOME FOLKS MIGHT NEED. UNIVERSITY HOUSING MORE THAN OTHER FOLKS -- BUT BUT WE ARE PLANNING ON EXPANDING CAPACITY DOUBLE ALSO PULL STUDENTS OUT OF THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES INTO THE STUDENT HOUSING -- AND HOPEFULLY KEEP THE RENT PRICES FROM RISING TOO MUCH NEAR THE CAMPUS. I HAVE NO QUESTIONS THAT IS THAT'S THAT'S MY PRESENTATION ON BASICALLY. TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH IS ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO HIRE ADDITIONAL CLINICIANS TO CARE FOR STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AT THE UC -- THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT A LONG TERM USE INITIATIVE TO ACHIEVE RECOMMENDING STASHING MET RECOMMENDED STAFFING RATIOS AND DECREASE WAIT TIME PATIENCE. THIS IS AN ISSUE OUR OFFICES STILL REVEALING WE'RE WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO GET BETTER DATA ON KIND OF WORKLOAD ESTIMATES THIS IS ULTIMATELY A STAFFING REQUEST WITH THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR IS TO HIRE MORE STAFF COUNSELORS AND PSYCHOLOGIST SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION BOTH. ON RISING DEMAND WHICH YOU SEE HAS PROVIDED SOME IN FOR EXISTING STAFFING CAPACITY -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT HOW MUCH MORE STAFF WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- IN ADDITION THERE ARE TWO OTHER -- ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER -- FIRST WORDS WERE STILL REVIEWING THIS OURSELVES BUT AT UC REQUIRES ALL STUDENTS AS A CONDITION OF RED REGISTERING TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND AS PART OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE TO ITS AND SUPPOSED TO COVER. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE STUDENTS -- OF CAMPUS BASED FEES AND ALSO SYSTEM WIDE FEES TO COVER. ON CAMPUS HEALTH SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF NEGATIVES OF THIS APPROACH ON THE ONE HAND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT. BECAUSE DUNES ARE PAUL PURCHASING INSURANCE AND THEY'RE PAYING FOR FEES THERE COULD BE SOME DOUBLE CHARGING HERE ON THE OTHER HAND THE UNIVERSITY HAS SOME ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY IT. DOES IT THIS WAY FOR EXAMPLE IT ENTER STUDENT PRIVACY -- IT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF PREPAYING IT THROUGH THEIR FEES I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH INSURANCE -- ALSO THERE MIGHT BE SOME SERVICES THAT AREN'T COVERED. AND THEN THIRD -- JUSTIN'S AS YOU HEARD OF BASIC NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE'S A AN EQUITY THERE BETWEEN YOU CCS YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I DON'T HAVE THE DATA IN FRONT OF ME UNFORTUNATELY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT TO THE THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU DID SOME -- ESTIMATE ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS. ON BUT USUALLY DOES HAVE A HIGHER COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO THAN THE OTHER TWO SEGMENTS AND IT RAISES QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS FIRST ON KIND OF HOW MANY LIVES EQUITIES OR IF THERE'S A RATIONALE FOR EXAMPLE. YOU SEE CAMPUSES HAVE MORE. STUDENTS TO LIVE ON CAMPUS SO PERHAPS THERE'S A RATIONAL TO PROVIDE IT MORE IT YOU SEE THE NEWS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE JUST RAISE IT AS AN ISSUE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. WE'LL SEE ISSUE DOESN'T PROVIDE THE EQUIVALENT OF SHIP EITHER. YES MY UNDERSTANDING I'M NOT I'M NOT AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT -- HEALTH INSURANCE IT'S YES YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS AGED THE ISSUE DOES NOT PROVIDE A C. ISSUE -- HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AS YOU SEE DOES SO THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE DIFFERENCE. WELL I'D BE INTERESTED IN I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE ABOUT THIS -- I ASSUME THE CAPS CENTERS DO NOT BILL AGAINST SHIP WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. UGH THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT THAT THE THAT STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE IS NOT BILLED FOR THE OF REGULAR MENTAL HEALTH. OF THIS HAS TO DO A LOT WITH STUDENT PRIVACY CONCERNS -- BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE INFORMED SOMETIMES WHEN -- WHEN THERE IS SUCH BILLING AGAINST AN INSURANCE BUT IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE BUILD ARE NOT BILLABLE? TO INSURANCE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY ARE -- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- SIR THAT. ANGST RELATED TO BEING AWAY FROM PARENTS BEING IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT -- THAT'S NOT USUALLY INSURANCE COVER FULL BECAUSE THE STUDENTS. ARE WHILE THEY MAY BE SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING SERVICES OFTEN DON'T HAVE A DIAGNOSABLE DISORDER. SO IT CANNOT ALWAYS BE BUILT BACK TO INSURANCE -- ALSO THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH IF WE STARTED BILLING FOR INSURANCE FOR THE REGULAR. OF MENTAL HEALTH OF COUNSELING VISITS. WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MEDICARE ALL INSURANCE FOR THAT AS WELL AND IF WE DO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO OPEN OUR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS. TO MEDIC CAL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR STUDENT STATUS. AND WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE CLINICS FOR OUR STUDENTS ONLY -- BUT I CAN LOOK INTO -- INTO HOW WHICH DEVELOP OUR SHIP RATES WHETHER OR NOT. THERE IS ANY OVERLAP IN THAT. I HAVE NO CLUE IN THE QUESTION I THIS IS A VERY VERY -- SERIOUS ISSUE SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT AND IN CASE YOU TWELVE K.. TWO FOURTEEN AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STRESSORS OUR STUDENT POPULATION TODAY AT ALL LEVELS ARE. GREAT AND AND INCREASING -- BY THE DAY IN THE MONTH SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE. A PROPERLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS ON CAMPUS TO TRY TO HELP IN WHATEVER WAY WE WE CAN'T WHETHER IT'S ON THE CAP CENTERS OR THROUGH THE STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING TODAY SERVICE ARE YOUR APPROVAL OF THE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING -- FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FROM CURRENT YEAR BE MADE PERMANENT ANOTHER STEP FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION AS PART OF THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING.% SO WAS EMBEDDED IN THAT CURRENT YEAR ONE TIME FUNDS WE RECEIVED. THAT -- WE'RE NOT RECEIVING AS AS AS CAN WE BE PROVIDED. THOSE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR EMPLOYING THE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY HIRED ON OUR CAMPUSES. ON SLIDE THIRTY FIVE I HAVE SOME DATA ON HOW MANY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN REQUESTING -- APPOINTMENTS. AT AT OUR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE OVER THE LAST DECADE FROM THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF 78% IN UNIQUE REQUEST FOR MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS OR MENTAL HEALTH CLIENTS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CAME IN FOR AN APPOINTMENT -- BACK IN. 27200079% OF STUDENTS -- REQUESTED A MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENT AND I WAS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. REQUEST AN APPOINTMENT NOW IT'S AND OF 13% IS ABOUT. OF IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WRIST REQUESTING AN APPOINTMENT SAYING THEY NEED TO COME IN. FOR THE C. SOMEBODY. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME TO STUDENTS WAIT TO SEE A COUNSELOR IS NINE DAYS BUT THAT'S AN AVERAGE IF IT'S A CRITICAL EMERGENCY IF THEY THINK THE STUDENTS SUICIDAL ORDER SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENING -- THEY WILL SEE THAT STUDENT IN THE SAME DAY SO THOSE WHO -- ARE FEELING DEPRESSED AND REQUESTING A CONCERT BUT DON'T SEEMTO BE IN CRISIS I HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO THE NINE DAYS AS AN AVERAGE -- AND ALSO THE AVERAGE STUDENT COMES IN FOR AT LEAST FOUR VISITS OB THAT VARIES BY CAMPUS HOW MANY THE COMMON FOR AND HOW MANY -- VISITS THE CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING CLINIC WILL SEE THEM FOR BEFORE AN OUTSIDE REFERRAL. THE SHIP THE STUDENTS PARENTS PAGE PROGRAM MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ONCE THEY'RE BEING PROVIDED OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS SERVICE STUDENT REQUIRES LONG TERM CARE -- THAT'S WHEN THE SHIP IS BEING BILLED. ANON SLIDE -- THIRTY SIX YOU WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA ABOUT -- UC'S MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR RATIO SON ACCOUNTS WERE RATIO WE ARE STARTING TO DO BETTER -- NOTICED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE HIRING OF SEVENTY NEW COUNSELORS. TOOK US DOWN FROM -- THIRTEEN OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR STUDENTS PER COUNSELOR. 210-001-0060 EIGHT STUDENTS PER COUNSELOR -- WE THINK THAT RATIO IS STILL A LITTLE BIT HIGH BUT WHERE THE RATIO SEEMS TO BE -- TOO HIGH FOR US IS THE PSYCHIATRIST TO STUDENTS WHERE WE WE STILL STRUGGLE WITH -- NOT HAVING ENOUGH. THOUGHT TRAIN PSYCHIATRISTS WHO CAN PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS. AND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE STARTED RAISING THE STUDENT SERVICES FEE. OF THE REGION'S HAD A POLICY THAT WE WOULDN'T B. FIVE FEET BY INCREASE AFTER FINANCIAL AID WOULD GO TO MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS. TO GET MORE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS THE CAMPUSES. AND THAT HAS YIELDED -- LAST YEAR THAT WAS BOUGHT OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE US YOU SEE THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION THERE ON THE FAR RIGHT COLUMN OF THE MENTAL HEALTH INCREMENTAL REVENUE. THAT WAS THE FOUR POINT EIGHT WAS -- STATE GENERAL FUND BUT ALL TOGETHER THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN AND STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. CONSULAR HIRINGS YOU SAW IN THE AGENDA. THERE WAS A HIS CHART HAVING TO DO WITH THE CAMPUS SPECIFIC PROVIDER TO STUDENT RATIOS HAVING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSES AND PSYCHIATRIST -- WHAT IS THE VACANCY RATE SO HIGH? IRVINE FOR EXAMPLE OR A RIVERSIDE. MAYBE MAYBE FOLKS CAN'T GET TO SANTA CRUZ BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS I MEAN YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE ABLE. TO FIND PROVIDERS TO FILL VACANCIES ON THOSE CAMPUSES. IS THAT OUR PRESENT WAITING SORRY STRUCTURES STATE GOVERNMENT THAT CAN'T BE. I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ARE -- MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS ARE PART OF OUR OF THE BARGAINING UNIT AND WE ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WITH THEM ON THE SALARIES OKAY [inaudible] GOT IT. ONE OF THE QUESTION LOOKING AT THE CHURCH IN THE AGENDA ON THE CAP CENTERS AND FEES AND LINKS LINKS OF SERVICES. THERE'S A VERY ATION -- AMONG CAMPUSES THE SET BECAUSE THIS LOCAL CONTROL ON THE CAMPUSES CONSIDERS. POLICIES. FOR THESE CAPS CENTERS. YES WE ALLOW THE CAMPUSES CONTROL THAT. WELL I THINK THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. ANYTHING FURTHER ON THIS ISSUE MA'AM. JUST FOR YOUR REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE FULL OF PROPOSAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY CLOSE THE CENTRAL ISSUE SO I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE CONTINUED DISCUSSION I SHOULD HAVE SAID AT THE BEGINNING WERE HOLDING ALL THESE OPEN. WHICH IS A GOOD THING -- GIVEN MY DYESS BUT WE'RE HOLDING ALL THESE OPEN WE WILL REVISIT THESE I GUARANTEE YOU -- AT A LATER DATE WHAT COVERS YOU NUMBER NINE WHICH IS CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] GREAT WORK. HELLO -- THANK YOU SENATOR OFF A MAJOR EDDIE CASTLETON APART OF FINANCE THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU -- CONSISTENT WITH AUTHORITY PROVIDED IN EDUCATION CODE SECTION 924-932-9249 SIX YOU SEEM A USE THAT SUPPORT APPROPRIATION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS ADDRESSING THE NEED OF FACILITIES THAT SERVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION THIS ABILITY ALLOWS YOU SEE TO FINANCE THE COST OF THE FURRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AT ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. HOWEVER AND NO MORE THAN 15% OF YOU SEE SUPPORT APPROPRIATION THAT OF THAT SERVICE CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY YOU SEE SUBMITTED ONE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AND SIX CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST. ALL ARE QUALIFYING PROJECTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN OUR LIMIT AND FINANCES PRELIMINARY APPROVAL LETTER -- IF FUNDED IT'LL RAISE THE MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF PROJECTED. THAT TO SIX POINT 8% WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE 15% THRESHOLD -- IN ADDITION TO THE CAP OUT LATE PROJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- JUST A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- THAT ARE BEING SUGGESTED WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROPOSED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING. ASSOCIATED PROJECTS AND SURE THAT SPENDING. IT USES THAT OUTCOMES. OF OUR FROM THE DEPARTMENT SPACE BUDGET DEPARTMENT DO NOT TYPICALLY PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL% REPORTING ON THESE PROJECTS AND RELATED EXPENDITURES -- IT MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL AND INFORMATIVE FOR STAFF AND THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED AND THE INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENTS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. AND WITH REGARDS TO DEPARTMENT OR PROJECTS WHERE THEY WITH A MAYBE A SPECIFIC INTEREST OR CONCERN. RATHER THAN IMPOSING A BROAD SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSED IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WHAT IS THE FUNDING LEVEL PROVIDED? FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK. SUFFICIENT TO AT LEAST. KEEP THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. DOLLAR FIGURE LEVEL AND NOT. HAVE IT INCREASING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS WE DO WORK IT IS YOU DO WORK ON BUILDING A BUILDING SEE MAY FALL ON THE LIST SO IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY AND WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE ON TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND HOW TO PREVENT IT FROM GROWING. OR OR NOT YEAH HOW TO PREVENT FROM GROWING HOWEVER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IT IS THE DAY THAT DYNAMIC PROCESS. IT CAN DEPEND ON THE POINT TIME ESTIMATES AS THE AND OR OR EVEN WHAT -- CROSSES A SPECIAL FROM DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INTO CAPITAL OUTLAY. BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING TARGETED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE DEPARTMENTS ONGOING FACILITY NEEDS BUT THIS GOAL OF PREVENTING AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- BUT AS AS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND IT IS AN ALLIANCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PAL. IS BALANCING ONE TIME AN ONGOING NEEDS WELL IT OCCURS TO ME WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS. SEEMS FINE TO ME WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR THE INSTITUTION TO KEEP ITS FACILITIES -- IN GOOD SHAPE. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ON HOW WE HOW WE FUND. THE THESE CAPITAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS ONE'S FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION I THINK SEE ISSUE. THE ISSUE SYSTEM HAS SOMETHING SIMILAR SOMETHING AROUND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN NEEDS -- SO THE TOTAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS -- AND IT'S NOT GOING DOWN ON ITS OWN ACCORD. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION HOW WE POSSIBLY AS A STATE CAN CAN FUND. THESE PROJECTS ON SOME REGULAR RECURRING BASIS SO WE WHITTLE THAT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL OR WHATEVER IT IS. DOWN OVER TIME I THINK THE WAY. YEAH I'M I'M IS CERTAINLY A GOAL IT WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE WEIGHED IN TOO WITH ALL THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT YOU SEE OR OR SINCE YOU ARE ANY DEPARTMENT. TO ADDRESS I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I'M JUST I'M JUST BAFFLED BY HOW WE GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS. THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND BEGIN. TO ADDRESS IT IN A IN A MEANINGFUL WAY INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED MILLION THERE WHEN THE THE WOMEN NOT TO IS. EIGHT TO NINE BILLION BUT WE WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU WERE DOING TO HELP -- YOU SEE AND THEY'RE NOT HERE BUT SEE ISSUE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THESE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS HELLO. YOU HAVE THREE ISSUES BEFORE YOU WHEN THIS ITEM THE FIRST AS DEBT SERVICE COSTS THE SECOND IS -- PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND IN THE THIRTIES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SOLVED ADDRESS EACH ISSUE ONE AT A TIME. REGARDING DEBT SERVICE COSTS VERY QUICKLY YOU SEE DEBT SERVICE COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED TURN INCREASED BY ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THESE ARE THIS DEBT SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED IN IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT YOU SEE IS NOW BEGINNING TO FINANCE THEM -- AND SO THIS IS A COST IT'S NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND IT MAY BE A COST THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS -- TO FACTOR INTO ITS BUDGETS FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY WHY DID WE CAP AT 15% CAN YOU REFRESH ME -- ALSO THE ENGINE AND MAY I JUST MAKE SURE I DIDN'T MISS SPEAK THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A JUST A INCREASE IN THE COST BUT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE 15% SO WE KEPT THERE YEAH. OKAY JUST MAKE SURE MAKING JORDAN TO SPEAK ON THAT -- BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE THE NUMBER FIFTEEN AND THEN -- YOU WOULD BE ME WHO IT WOULD MISSPOKE YEAH SO THE THE IDEA BEHIND AND I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION AS TO WHY EXACTLY U. 15% IT YOU SEE SO IT'S A DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE SEGMENT -- WHAT I WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT -- IT IN FACTORING IN ROLLING IN DEBT SERVICE COSTS TO THE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT BUDGET -- THE IDEA WAS THAT TH UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TWO WAY TRADE OFF EACH YEAR BETWEEN. A REGULARS ARE OPERATING COSTS AND ROMAN I CAPITAL OUTLAY AND SO THAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAS. TO PROVIDE A GREATER INCENTIVE FOR THAT THE CAP IS INTENDED I THINK. TO PROTECT -- THE RECORD RAIN REMAINING PRIORITIES AND USE HIS BUDGET SO IT TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T GO ABOVE THAT PERCENT AND IT TAKES AWAY RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE MOMENT GROWTH OR COMPENSATION COSTS OR OTHER SORT OF OPERATING PRIORITIES I THINK THAT WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND THAT CAP BUT AGAIN I DON'T. HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHY THE C. LANDED ON THAT EXACT PERCENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND YOU CAN SEE THOSE PROJECTS ON PAGE FORTY OF YOUR AGENDA. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE IS A THE FIRST ITEM THERE'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I'M GONNA SAVE THAT FOR THE THIRD. ISSUE THAT I RAISE SO THAT KEEP THE REMAINING SIX ARE IN OUR PROJECTS THEY GO TO CONSTRUCT NEW PROJECTS ON THE OR THE RENOVATION PROJECTS. AND WE RAISED ISSUES WITH WITH THE TWO OF THE PROJECTS -- AT SANTA BARBARA AND SANTA CRUZ THEY'RE BOTH PROJECTS BROADLY -- THEY'RE INTENDED THEIR THEIR INTENTION IS TO ADD MORE -- CLASSROOM SPACE ACROSS THE CAMPUSES. A NEW BUILDINGS -- WE HAVE SOME PROJECT LEVEL CONCERNS AS WELL BUT ARC ARE CROSS CUTTING CONCERN WITH BOTH PROJECTS IS THAT THEY FOCUS HEAVILY ON LARGE LECTURE SPACE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT CLASSROOM USE THAT YOU SEE AT THAT. VIRTUALLY ALL CAMPUSES -- LARD LARGE LECTURE SPACE IS. IT USED MUCH MORE THAN SMALL CLASSROOM SPACE FOR EXAMPLE ON THAT. LINES OF OTHER INFORMATION YOU FOR TODAY FOR EXAMPLE -- INCREASING CLASS SIZES FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S THAT'S FOR MANY YEARS HOW YOU SEE IS DELIVERED UNDER LARGE LECTURES STUDENTS ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS IN A CLASS. OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE STATE IN RECENT YEARS HAS PROVIDED ONGOING FUNDING TO EXPAND ONLINE EDUCATION. AND YOU SEE NOTED THAT THERE IS -- SOME POLICY DEBATE BETWEEN THE MERITS OF ONLINE VERSES IN FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION IN OUR VIEW OF THE THAT DEBATE PROBABLY MAKES LESS SENSE ONCE THE CLASS I STARTS HITTING A HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS -- IS PROBABLY NOT THE SAME LEVEL OF PERSONAL CONNECTION AS AS OPPOSED TO SAY -- A CLASS THAT HAS MAYBE FORTY STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE. AND GIVEN THAT THE STATE IS. PROVIDING FUNDING TO EXPAND ONLINE EDUCATION. ARE WE RAISE THE CONCERN THAT WHETHER YOU SEE IS ADEQUATELY USING ONLINE EDUCATION. TO A KIND OF MEAT AND ROMAN DEMAND AN END USER TO HAVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NEW CAMPUS CONTINUED -- BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. AND ONE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY FACILITY OF PRIORITIES INCLUDING AS YOU NOTED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIFE SAFETY OF PROJECTS. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE QUESTION WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY COULD DO MORE TO FIND ALTERNATIVES TO ACCOMMODATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND TO EASE -- CAPACITY ISSUES IN LARGE LECTURE HALLS THAT'S OUR CONCERN THERE WELL IT YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I I I I DO ENCOURAGE. IN THINK OUR UNIVERSITIES SHOULD LOOK AT ONLINE EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF ISSUES DUKE'S SYSTEMS DOING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD. UTILIZE MORE ONLINE EDUCATION WERE APPROPRIATE CERTAINLY TAKING A LOOK AT THAT FOR BOTTLENECK COURSES AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. BUT I ALSO THINK IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION -- FOR THE STUDENTS BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO FUNCTION VERY WELL ON THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AND SOME. SOME WILL AND I JUST WONDER ADDING A LARGE LECTURE HALL FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE THAN ENOUGH STUDENTS. TO FILL THAT WHO WOULD OPT OUT OF ONLINE EDUCATION THAT WOULD YOU KNOW BE MY RESPONSE BUT I GUESS WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT OKAY. ON AND THEN THE THE THIRD CONCERN A THIRD ISSUE WAS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND EGGS AT THIS IS A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE IN TWO DIFFERENT AREAS BUT YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT MEANINGS PROPOSALS. THE FIRST IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERMENTS PROJECTS. AND THEN SECONDLY THE UNIVERSITY -- IS ALSO PROPOSING A THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OF BOTH OF THOSE COMBINED OUR OUR IS WHAT'S BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS. WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS ASSESSMENT AND I'LL GET TO THAT IN MY TESTIMONY? A TOP I'LL BE SURETO TOUCH ON THAT -- AND I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I SHOULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION NOW TO FIND THAT OUT OF THE BOND FUND SO THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION FIVE OF THAT WOULD GO FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION ASSESSMENT. THE REMAINING THIRTY WOULD BE FOR PROJECTS. IS THAT NORMAL. WHAT WE WRITE WE RAISE CONCERN WITH THAT WE THINK THAT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF BOND FUNDS THE BOND FUNDS CARRY THE COST OF A? PROJECT OVER MANY YEARS THIS WOULD BE A ONE TIME STUDY. I WILL NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS CURRENTLY DOING A FACILITY CONDITION ASSESSMENT THIS IS ASSESSING THE CONDITION OF ITS EXISTING FACILITIES AND SO YOU KNOW TO THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. OF THE UNIVERSITY -- IS HOPING TO GET A MORE REFINED ESTIMATE FROM THE STUDY IT USED BOND FUNDS FOR THAT STUDY RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS NONE THE LESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED A UP A FORTY FOR THAT AND SO YOU KNOW DO YOU SEE WHAT I HAD AND FUNDED THAT'S THEIR BOND FUNDS. SO THEY THEY'VE DONE THAT IN THE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE WE WE RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION ASSESSMENT AND AND JUST TO SPECIFY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION ASSESSMENT IT'S LOOKING AT ROADWAYS UTILITIES OTHER THINGS THAT THAT ARE SEPARATE ROM THE FACILITIES AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THOSE TWO STUDIES FOR THE FIVE MILLION. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I CAN GET I CAN GET BACK TO THEY THEY GAVE US A OF AN ESTIMATE OF DEBT SERVICE COSTS I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME BUT THEY THEY DID INCLUDE THE COST OF INTEREST I CAN I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. BUT THERE IS A COST OF INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I MEAN I THINK THIS IS WE NEED TO STUDY I MEAN I THINK THE STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE DON'T FIND IT -- THE GENERAL FUND. IN AND PRESERVE. THAT SMALL RELATIVELY SMALL PIECE OF YOU SEES BONDING CAPACITY ANOTHER ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THAT THIS IS -- ONE TIME FUNDING LONG TERM YOU SEE WILL LIKELY HAVE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE STUDIES TO CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT ESTIMATE RELEVANT IN FUTURE YEARS. AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF HOW YOU CIVIL -- FUNDED IN AN ONGOING BASIS ONCE THE INITIAL STUDIES COMPLETED. NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE BUDGET. RIGHT UP IN THAT THAT'S ONE OPTION YES. BUT A MINIATURE OF TRUCK NOT SURE -- SOMEONE THING WE WE NOTED WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS -- WRIT LARGE IS THAT -- THERE WEREN'T PROPOSE PROJECTS AT THE TIME WE RETURN ELSE'S WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE GET A LIST OF PROJECTS BEFORE APPROPRIATING FUNDS. I WILL NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY SUBMITTED TO OUR OFFICE -- A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT INTENSE I IT APPEARS FOR BOTH THE ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE BOND FUNDING WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT LIST WE RECEIVED AT MONDAY AFTERNOON BUT THE UNIVERSITY WAS WORKING WITH US TO PROVIDE. MORE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. THE OTHER THING WE RECOMMENDED AND I THINK THIS GETS AT SOME OF THE BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE ABOUT -- HAVING A LONG TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. CURLY THAT'S LACKING ACROSS ALL OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. AND THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MUCH -- SENSE OF HOW IT THE THESE ONE TIME FUNDS EACH YEAR ARE REALLY GOING TO PAY DOWN THAT BACKLOG WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE EACH SEGMENT TO INCLUDING YOU SEE. A LONG TERM PLAN TO RETIRE THIS BACKLOG AND THAT SUCH A PLAN WOULD IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY EACH YEAR NEEDED. TO RETIRE THAT BACK GLAD THAT GIVE THE LEGISLATURE A BETTER A RATIONALE TO MAKE THESE SORT OF ONE TIME FUNDING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THAT PLAN WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A PLAN MOVING FORWARD AND HOW TO IMPROVE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES SUCH THAT A BACKLOG DOESN'T CONTINUE EACH YEAR AND ALL MAINTENANCE IS. PART OF THE REGULAR ONGOING OPERATIONS. MAYBE YOU SAID THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HELP ME UNDERSTAND. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MAINTENANCE THAT. THAT REQUIRES CONSTRUCTION SO YOU'RE IMPROVING -- CAPITAL FACILITY FOR EXAMPLE AS OPPOSED -- TO REPLACING AN AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM OR HEATING SYSTEM OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT. I WOULD THINK THAT LONG TERM BOND MONEY WOULD BE -- IT WOULD BE QUESTIONABLE USE OF THAT SORT OF FUNDING STREAM. THAT'S RIGHT SO -- TECHNICALLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REFERS TO THE LATTER OF WHICH YOU DESCRIBE IT REFERS. TO H. FAQ REPLACEMENTS OTHER SERVER IN -- FACILITY REPLACEMENTS THAT MAINTAIN THE USEFUL LIFE IT TYPICALLY DOESN'T INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION. OUR RENOVATIONS OR CORRECTIONS ARE THINGS THAT THAT CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE BUILDING. WE DID RAISE CONCERNS WITH. ADDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO AN ALLOWABLE USE A BOND FUNDS AND OF I THINK WHAT WAS ADDED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RAISE THE CONCERN THEN. I'M WE WE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE EVEN A RATIONAL FOR SOME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OF MIGHT HAVE A LONG USEFUL LIFE BUT WE WANTED SOME MORE WE RECOMMENDED THERE IS THERE BE MORE DEFINITION AS TO WHAT. CONSTITUTED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WOULD BE ALLOWABLE USE FOR BOND FUNDS -- YOU LOST THAT ARGUMENT CORRECTION GOTCHA. OKAY I WAS JUST WONDERING IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW. THAT'S A REAL THAT'S A REASONABLE CONCERN TO RAISE. WE WOULD PROBABLY GET A HOME BUT I GUESS WE DO IT HERE. ON THE NET AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE THREE ISSUES I THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS YOU SEE. I THANK YOU SENATOR WE REQUEST -- YOUR APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU SEE CURRENTLY HAS THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT -- THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICALPROJECTS AND WERE. WERE VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO BE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS -- WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT A LONG TERM PLAN. ON ADDRESSING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES AT UC -- I THINK OUR INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY WILL HELP WITH THAT ONCE WE HAVE AN IDEA OF OF WHAT. NEEDS TO GET FIXED OUR OR SURE -- TO MAINTENANCE PROJECTS SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE -- SOME OF THE SOME OF THE EFFICIENCIES GREAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE EFFICIENCIES WE CAN TAKE FOR EXAMPLE -- IF WE HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM THAT'S ABOUT TO FAIL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AND SEE THAT MAYBE THERE'S TWENTY SUCH AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS ON ALL OUR CAMPUSES. AND THEN WE COULD NEGOTIATE A BETTER RATE WITH -- WITH A PROVIDER FOR FOR THOSE ARE TWO UNITS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO THIS ONE OF THE WHERE WE GET IT WE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHY WE WOULD BORROW. LET'S SAY I DON'T KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE BONDS BUT WHY WE WOULD BORROW AND USE THIRTY YOUR MONEY. BUY A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT HAS A SEVEN YEAR USEFUL LIFE AND MAYBE THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY. TO TO FINANCE THAT. OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. TO CREATE A POOL FOR THAT SORT OF EQUIPMENT PURCHASES OPPOSED. TO YOU'RE GOING TO THE MARKET TO BORROW. X. AMOUNT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THIRTY YEARS TO BUY THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY. THREE OR FOUR TIMES FOR OR TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING MY MAKING SENSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR DO I NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS. IN THE ARMY TO CRITICIZE. THANK YOU SENATOR -- GENERALLY A LOT OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT IS BEING FUNDED WOULD BE SUCH AS BOILERS OR EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS THAT TEND TO HAVE A USEFUL LIFE THAT WOULD BE LONGER THAN THAT THE TERM OF THE BOND. ALSO A LITTLE WHILE THAT MAKES OUR FALL GEO BONDS ARE OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY YEAR BONDS IT IS POSSIBLE TO STILL SHORTER TERM BONDS SO SAY. IF IT IS A CHILLER SYSTEM THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FIFTEEN YEARS. THEN YOU CAN SELL BONDS THAT WOULD BE PAID OFF IN ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO THERE IS AN EFFORT TO MATCH THE LENGTH OF THE BOND WITH THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ITEM THAT YOU'RE WORKING NOW CERTAINLY THE GOAL SIR -- BECAUSE THESE ARE YOU CEASE OWN INTERNAL BORROWING CAPACITY WE CAN CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE PAY BACK AMOUNT -- WE DO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND PALEO THAT -- IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO MOVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY OUT OF THE BOND INTO THE ONE TIME FUNDS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR SO IF YOU WOULD PERMIT US TO DO THAT WE'LL. WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT SO THAT THE BORROWING CAPACITY IS NOT PAYING FOR THE STUDY. OF BUT RATHER TO ONE TIME FUNDS WE WOULD GET WOULD PAY FOR THAT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THANK YOU THAT THE LA ON TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THAT -- THE REASON WE HAVE DEVELOPED THIS VERY LENGTHY SOME OF THE REASONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED A VERY LENGTHY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT LIST IS THAT. YOU SEE UNDERWENT A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND THESE BUILDINGS ARE NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE STARTING TO FALL APART AND EVERYTHING IS BREAKING -- AND WHILE [inaudible] WE WERE. HAVING OUR BUDGETS REDUCED OR NOT GROWN ENOUGH TO MEET SOME OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL DEMANDS OF OUR STUDENTS -- WE SCALED BACK SOME OF THESE MAKE THOSE FUNDS THAT WAS AND THAT WAS ONE PLACE TO SCALE BACK. SO REALLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OF BEING A REFLECTION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE. OUR CUTBACKS WERE MADE WHEN FUNDS WERE NEEDED TO BE SHIFTED ELSEWHERE. THAT HASN'T BEEN ARCTIC ADEQUATELY FUNDED WELL I'M VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WE'RE FACING YOU'RE FACING AN ADULT THE STUDY IS IMPERATIVE AND HOWEVER WE FINANCE IT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESULTS ALL RIGHT -- I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC SANTA BARBARA PROJECTS THAT WERE PRODUCT BY DE LA OKAY -- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT UCSANTA BARBARA THE LAST TIME THEY HAD A NEW TOTALLY NEW CLASSROOM PROJECT. COULDN'T -- GIVING THEM ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WAS IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WE THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY CAUGHT AN ADDITIONAL BUILDING WITH NEW CAPACITY -- THIS BUILDING WOULD GIVE THEM BRAND NEW CLASSROOMS ARE MORE FLEXIBLE SPACE. AND ALLOW THEM -- TO ALSO HAVE A LARGER ONE LARGER CLASSROOM WHERE THEY COULD TEACH ARE CURRENTLY ON THE SANTA BARBARA CLASS -- CAMPUS THEIR CLASSROOMS THAT ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN CAPACITY ARE OVER 1100%. UTILIZE WHAT THAT MEANS IS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AM AND FIVE PM MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. ARE TOTALLY BOOKED AND THEN THEY'RE TEACHING IN THE EVENINGS AND THOSE CLASSROOMS AS WELL THEY REALLY NEED MORE MORE CAPACITY -- ON THE SANTA CRUZ CAMPUS OUR UTILIZATION OF CLASSROOM CAPACITY SHOWS THAT FOR ALL CLASSROOMS OVER ONE HUNDRED SEATS. THERE AGAIN 1100% OVER AT MORE THAN 1100% CAPACITY THEY THEY VERY MUCH NEED NEW CAPACITY ON THE CAMPUS AS WELL. AND THIS HAS BEEN IN THERE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT AND AND WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THESE PROJECTS BE ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD. AS REQUESTED WELL WE'RE PUSHING YOU TO TAKE MORE STUDENTS. EACH YEAR SO WHETHER WE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE FOR IT OR NOT AND FOR GOING TO PUSH YOU TO TAKE MORE STUDENTS WE BETTER. MAKES YOU SURE YOU HAVE CLASSROOMS TO TEACH STUDENTS AND SO. I UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST. THANK YOU OF IN ADDITION WE ARE REQUESTING -- FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEBT SERVICE TO HELP PAY FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY APPROVED AND CONSTRUCTEDTHIS IS TRUE THE PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OUTLINED FOR YOU EARLIER -- THE ALSO CALLED THE AB NINETY FOUR THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOW COMING DUE. FOR FOR THE DEBT SERVICE WERE APPROVED -- ONE OF THEM WAS APPROVED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SEVERAL OF THEM WERE APPROVED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWO WERE APPROVED. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THEY'VE NOW BEEN FULLY CONSTRUCTED AND WE ARE STARTING TO PAY THE DEBT SERVICE ON THEM. IF THIS ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR THE DEBT SERVICE FUNDING IS NOT APPROVED THEN THE MONEY COMES OUT OF OUR EXISTING BASE OPERATING BUDGET [inaudible] I SEE. ANYTHING FURTHER THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU SIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL LET'S YES SIR PLEASE I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE TWO PROJECTS -- THAT I RAISED CONCERNS WITH EARLIER. FIRST I I I DON'T THINK I RESPONDED VERY WELL TO A QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED AND I JUST WANTED. TO ELABORATE MORE ON I THINK THE QUESTION YOU RAISED AS WELL SHOULDN'T STUDENTS HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN. FACE TO FACE AND ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND ALL WE WERE SUGGESTING IS THAT -- YOU SEE COULD GRADUALLY MOVE TOWARDS USING INCORPORATING I'M ONLINE INSTRUCTION MORE IT STILL HAS A LECTURE HALLS THAT USES FOR FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS STILL WOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE IT WOULD JUST BE A QUESTION OF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THOSE KINDS OF SPACES OR DO. YOU WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON THE LOWER -- SMALLER CLASSROOMS WHERE THAT THERE'S MAYBE MORE OF THAT TRADE OFF BETWEEN -- FACE TO FACE AND ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND AND IN. WELL IT AND AGAIN IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONTINUED DISCUSSION I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I THINK OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS ALL THREE COULD DO MORE WITH ONLINE. THIS IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION IS STEPPING OUT FAIRLY SMARTLY ON AT THE BEGINNING STAGES BUT SEE ISSUE AND YOU SEE -- HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT ONLINE IT'S A DEBATE AND INTERNAL DEBATE -- I KNOW I THINK I KNOW WITH THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND FACULTY AND WHETHER ONLINE IS GOOD -- ONLINE IS BAD BUT I'M SURE YOU SEAL CONTINUED TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND WERE APPROPRIATE TRY -- TO AND ONLINE PROGRAMS. BUT IN THE INTERIM AS WE PUSH THEM. TO TAKE IN MORE STUDENTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CLASSROOMS TEACHING MEN AND SO THAT'S WHY I MADE THE COMMENT I'D I DID BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ANSWER YOU DID A GREAT JOB. THANK YOU JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GAVE YOU THAT INFORMATION THE OTHER INFORMATION -- JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF IS -- AS YOUR WEIGHING BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPUSES SANTA CRUZ IN SANTA BARBARA. SANTA CRUZ DOES HAVE A LOT MORE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS THROUGH LARGE LECTURE HALLS ARE ARE HEAVILY UTILIZED AND THEIR LOOK SMALLER CLASSROOMS ALSO HEAVILY UTILIZED IN THE PROJECT WOULD DO A MIX OF BOTH AND THERE WAS SOME WE SAW SOME MERIT THERE WE HAD SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WITH. SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL SPACE WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON IF IF. THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE BUT THE SMALLER CLASSROOM SPACE HAD SOME MERIT BARBER CAMPUS. DOES HE WAS THERE A LARGE LECTURES OVER A 100% THEY'RE SMALLER CLASSROOMS ARE NOT USE THAT CAPACITY AND THE PROJECT CAN INCLUDE A MIX OF BOTH SMALL AND LARGE SPACE AND SO THAT WAS ONE RESULT. THE SCOPE OF THE SMALLER CLASSROOMS ALSO -- HAD MAYBE LESS AMERICAN SAY AT THE SANTA CRUZ CAMPUS NOW GIVEN THE EXISTING UP PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT LESS ABILITY TO PROVE A REJECT PROPOSALS HAVE EVEN LESS ABILITY. TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF PROJECTS AND SO THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF COMPLEXITY IS REVIEWING THESE DIFFERENT SCOPES BUT THAT THAT SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROJECTS AS REVIEWING THEM. THANK YOU YES MA'AM. IF I MAY JUST COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY YOU. YOU SEE COMES UP WITH THESE PROJECTS IS THAT THERE IS A LENGTHY. OF APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS OFF THEM WHERE THEY CAMPUSES DEVELOP A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOLKS ON THOSE CAMPUSES CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE NEEDS AND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CONSTRUCT A BUILDING. IT GETS ON A TEN YEAR OF PLAN FOR THE CAMPUS THAT GETS APPROVED BY THE REGENTS. THEN WHEN THE PROJECT IS COMING UP FOR DEVELOPMENT. OF THE REDO THOSE PLANS AGAIN WERE MUCH MORE DETAIL SO IT'S NO LONGER BACK OF THE ENVELOPE BUT THEY'VE REALLY LOOK AT THE SITE AND WHAT THE WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CAMPUSES GROWING NEEDS. AND THEN IT GOES IN FRONT OF THE REGIONS FOR APPROVAL SO THERE'S MULTIPLE LEVELS WHERE THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING LOOKED AT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY MATCH THE CAMPUSES NEEDS. HI BOB HELLO PERTINENT TO SEE PROJECTS GO UP AND I THINK YOU WILL DO A VERY FINE JOB IN MANAGING YOUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE IN THE THE RESULT IS QUITE SPECTACULAR SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY OF ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY VAN AUSTIN I REPRESENT JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH WHICH FOCUSES ON A FORMER BOSS YOUTH TRANSITIONING INTO INDEPENDENT LIVING.
