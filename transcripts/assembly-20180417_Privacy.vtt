00:32:45.597 --> 00:32:47.766 region:rollup2
LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:49.734 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WANTED TO TAKE IT.

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:52.037 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT AS A PRIVACY

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:52.971 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL MYSELF WE DO NEED

00:32:52.037 --> 00:32:55.240 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER BOUNCING THE

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:56.608 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INTERESTS WITH THE

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.144 region:rollup2
PRIVACY INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:32:56.608 --> 00:33:00.111 region:rollup2
I FEEL THAT OFTENTIMES ONE OF

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.413 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CAN TAKE A LOOK AT A

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:03.715 region:rollup2
PRECEDENCE I THINK DRIVING AT

00:33:01.413 --> 00:33:05.717 region:rollup2
THAT BALANCE IS NOT SOMETHING WE

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:06.651 region:rollup2
CAN IT ANY LONGER AVOID. I THINK

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:09.821 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.289 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRIVACY AND I THINK WHAT

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.823 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE IS

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:13.959 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS SOMETHING.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:15.494 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPANEK RIGHT

00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:17.062 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:18.330 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK WE CAN'T DO

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:20.131 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.000 region:rollup2
DATA BREACHES WHETHER IT'S WITH

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:23.735 region:rollup2
FACEBOOK CAMBER TELEMATICA? OR

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.336 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S WITH EXPERIENCE

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:25.837 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT WE'VE

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.172 region:rollup2
SEEN RECENTLY.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:28.306 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO IS I

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:29.241 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE COULD SAY WE

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.775 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WE KNOW ABOUT THESE

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.978 region:rollup2
BREACHES.

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:34.412 region:rollup2
WITH MATT WE DISCUSSED IT AND

00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:36.181 region:rollup2
YET WE DECIDE TO DO NOTHING.

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:37.515 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD ASK THAT THIS IS

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:38.116 region:rollup2
SOMETHING A REASONABLE STEP IN

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:40.151 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE COULD

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:41.386 region:rollup2
TAKE TO ACTUALLY TAKE CONSUMERS

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:43.355 region:rollup2
AND OUR CONSTITUENTS PRIVACY

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.089 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION.

EXISTING REGULATED TO DO.

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:36.087 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:38.156 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH IS

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:40.558 region:rollup2

00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:15.460 region:rollup2
I.

00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:17.362 region:rollup2
LIKE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BILL

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.029 region:rollup2
ARE IT AS IT'S A CURRENTLY

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.498 region:rollup2
PRINTED.

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:21.866 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE PART THAT WOULD

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:23.635 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:24.636 region:rollup2
ALL YET I THINK THERE ARE PARTS

00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:26.304 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL THAT MAY BE

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:28.306 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT EXAMPLE A CERTAIN

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:30.375 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE BILL. MAY ALREADY

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:31.342 region:rollup2
BE BEEN COVERED BY A ON THE

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:32.777 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW FOR EXAMPLE CHINA

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.311 region:rollup2
CHINA CHINA LIKE LAW WHICH

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.546 region:rollup2
COVERS A LOT OF THE POLICY

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:36.214 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:38.616 region:rollup2
BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT DIE YOU

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:40.718 region:rollup2

00:38:44.956 --> 00:38:46.658 region:rollup2
FINE TUNED OUT CONCEPT AND

CLOSE.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.736 region:rollup2
SINCE THERE ARE NO GOOD FOR THE

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:00.004 region:rollup2

BILL IT'S MUCH NEEDED. AND.

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.780 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT I I HAD A

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:31.482 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU MAYBE I

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.451 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF SUGGESTIONS SO I AS

YOU POINTED OUT. THE.

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:35.686 region:rollup2
CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:38.189 region:rollup2
SECRETARY OF STATE IS JUST TO

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:39.957 region:rollup2
SCAN. THE FORMS THAT ARE

00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:42.260 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED FOR THEIR APPROVAL SO

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:43.494 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING WHAT THEIR NEW

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.063 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED PROTOCOL IS GOING TO

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:46.964 region:rollup2
BE ARE THEY. GOING TO HAVE TO

00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:48.1000 region:rollup2
REDACT EVERY FORM THAT IS

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO THEM. YES THE IDEAS

00:42:48.1000 --> 00:42:51.803 region:rollup2
PRESS TO HAVE THEM REDACT THE

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.404 region:rollup2
HOME ADDRESS AND ALSO THE

00:42:51.803 --> 00:42:55.306 region:rollup2
SIGNATURE NOW IT'S BEEN BOMBED

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.840 region:rollup2
PROPOSED AS WELL THAT BUSINESS

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:58.242 region:rollup2
OWNERS COULD.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.744 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THEY USE A PO BOX

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:01.245 region:rollup2
STYLE ADDRESS LIKE UPS STORE

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:02.914 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF THEIR HOME ADDRESS OR

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:04.282 region:rollup2
THEIR BUSINESS STOREFRONT.

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:05.516 region:rollup2
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT ALSO

00:43:04.282 --> 00:43:06.851 region:rollup2
ADDS AN EXTRA CHALLENGE TO THE

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:08.519 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNER IN THE EXPENSE OF

00:43:06.851 --> 00:43:09.921 region:rollup2
TRYING TO.

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:12.423 region:rollup2
SECURE THOSE ADDRESSES.

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:14.525 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THE.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:15.460 region:rollup2
IF THAT IS THAT I CAN I CAN SEE

00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:16.828 region:rollup2
THE SECRETARY OF STATE BEGINNING

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.029 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT MOVING FORWARD BUT

00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:19.230 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A DATABASE WITH

00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:20.565 region:rollup2
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THESE

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.866 region:rollup2
FORMS ALREADY. THAT'S AND I

00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:23.801 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY ONEROUS

00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:25.503 region:rollup2
TASK TO GO HAVE TO REDACT EVERY

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:26.404 region:rollup2
SINGLE ONE OF THEM SO NOT SURE

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:27.672 region:rollup2
HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT DOING

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:28.873 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT WILL THIS BILL

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:30.508 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ASK FOR THEM TO DO IT

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:31.909 region:rollup2
AS A BUSINESS BOARD AS OPPOSED

AND IT'S CLEAR THAT FROM THE

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:07.184 region:rollup2

BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH CLOUD

FROM A LICENSED REGULATED LENDER

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:52.002 region:rollup2

OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERE

THAT INFORMATION ON THAT WHAT

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:39.176 region:rollup2
THE VENDOR CAN AND CANNOT DO. SO

THERE ARE A VARIETY OF UNDER

CALIFORNIA HAS TO.

00:54:56.827 --> 00:55:00.164 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WOULD LIKE

00:54:58.529 --> 00:55:01.198 region:rollup2

STATE CONTROLLED DATABASE.

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:08.005 region:rollup2

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:14.478 region:rollup2
UNLIKE OTHER CREDIT BUREAU

00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:17.981 region:rollup2
WHAT A CONSUMER?

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.616 region:rollup2
PAYS ALONE ON TIME THEY SHOULD

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:21.485 region:rollup2
GET CREDIT FOR THAT DATABASE IN

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:23.053 region:rollup2
THIS IT FOR THAT DOT FOR THAT

00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:25.189 region:rollup2

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:27.257 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE. THIS TYPE OF DATA

00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:28.959 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SEALED IN A SILO

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:29.860 region:rollup2
DATABASE AND NO OTHER LENDER

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:31.862 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.663 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU THAT GOOD PERFORMANCE

00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:34.431 region:rollup2

CONSUMER.

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:37.868 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE FORTY

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:39.303 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION CONSUMERS IN THE

00:55:40.604 --> 00:55:43.974 region:rollup2
WHO ARE CREDIT INVISIBLES

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:45.609 region:rollup2

HAVE A FINANCIAL IDENTITY.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.451 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO FORCE

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:56.854 region:rollup2
LENDERS TO REPORT TO A DATABASE

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT WOULD BE WISER. TO

00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:59.756 region:rollup2
USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:01.458 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORTING SYSTEMS THAT

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:03.026 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXIST.

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:03.660 region:rollup2
THERE WE THEREFORE WE CAN BUILD

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.929 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:08.532 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS CREDIT FILES

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:10.300 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM MY FINANCIAL IDENTITY.

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:12.135 region:rollup2

COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.745 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR CHIEF CONCERN.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:23.747 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT.

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:26.550 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:27.851 region:rollup2
WHETHER INADVERTENTLY OR NOT.

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.720 region:rollup2

STATE.

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:18.562 region:rollup2

SO THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:41.952 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:44.287 region:rollup2

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:09.012 region:rollup2
MATCHING THESE RECORDS IS A VERY

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:11.148 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE ACCURACY

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT IN THESE.

00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:15.952 region:rollup2

AND GET THEIR INFORMATION IS

00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:25.962 region:rollup2
VERY DANGEROUS NOW I UNDERSTAND.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:29.199 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO BALANCE.

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:30.500 region:rollup2
PRIVACY AND SECURITY BUT WE

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:32.002 region:rollup2

ACCURACY THAT MUST BE MET I

00:59:32.002 --> 00:59:35.338 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO SAY.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:37.774 region:rollup2
THAT UNDER THIS LAW EXPERIAN

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:40.110 region:rollup2

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:41.545 region:rollup2
AS THE CERTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:42.779 region:rollup2

00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:44.448 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:45.515 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD.

00:59:44.448 --> 00:59:47.217 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T SUSTAIN THE

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:47.511 region:rollup2
EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSE SEEING

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
NONE. LET'S UP BRING IT BACK TO

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:50.113 region:rollup2
OUR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:53.817 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:56.253 region:rollup2
OUR THAT YES MISGUIDED ED.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:58.822 region:rollup2
VETERANS LEARN.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:59.823 region:rollup2
SO I I YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE I

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.191 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THIS NOTION THAT WE

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.692 region:rollup2
SHOULD LIMIT EACH PERSON TO ONE

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.493 region:rollup2
PAYDAY LOAN BUT.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.561 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT IF

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.229 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO ACCOMPLISH

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:07.564 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING IF THERE MIGHT BE.

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.865 region:rollup2
AND I EASIER WAYS TO DO IT AND

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:10.233 region:rollup2
GREEN THIS BIG KNEW.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:11.968 region:rollup2
DATABASE SEEMS LIKE QUITE AN

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.436 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING OTHERS PRIVACY

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.137 region:rollup2
CONCERNS APPARENTLY ISSUES OF

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.639 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.640 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:18.241 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.043 region:rollup2
I SO YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT JUST

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.878 region:rollup2
HAVING THE PAYDAY LENDERS ASK

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.813 region:rollup2
PEOPLE YET ANOTHER ONE OUT.

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:25.949 region:rollup2
AT THAT I DON'T THINK WOULD WORK

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:27.417 region:rollup2
AND I I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.952 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT THAT WOULD WORK

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:31.788 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT WOULD GET TO THE END

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:33.790 region:rollup2
GOAL WHICH IS ENSURING. THAT.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:35.425 region:rollup2
A CONSUMER.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.793 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.994 region:rollup2
IF YOU NEED MORE THAN THREE

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.863 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S A

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:41.665 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR YOU AND SO

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.466 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS THAT THIS. BILL

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:45.035 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.236 region:rollup2
STACK BUT RATHER IT WOULD DIRECT

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.704 region:rollup2
IN TO A DIFFERENT PRODUCT THE

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:48.338 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED OVER PRODUCT THE

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.139 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ARE IN OVER

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:50.507 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.575 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:53.877 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY ABOUT.

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:56.046 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT ON THERE'S

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:57.981 region:rollup2
BEEN A NUMBER OF I THINK BANKING

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.381 region:rollup2
POLICY IT DIDN'T ISSUES THAT

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.350 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.885 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP HERE AND THE BANKING

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.852 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE DID GET THIS BILL OUT

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.387 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY SO THOSE WERE

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:05.822 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IN BANKING ONE WAS

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:08.525 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A MERRY

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
OF ONE. A LOAN AT A TIME THAT WE

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.361 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.462 region:rollup2
THIS IS CREATING A CREDIT FOR I

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.997 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.565 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN OPINIONS THERE.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.866 region:rollup2
AND AND THE ISSUE OF CREDIT

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:18.235 region:rollup2
REPORTING ALL TOGETHER IS I

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:20.003 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT VIA A DIFFERENT

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:21.671 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR THE BANKING COMMITTEE.

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:23.273 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE DATABASE IS

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
CONCERNED AND WE KNOW THAT THE

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:27.611 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES YEAH STAFF WAS VERY.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:30.280 region:rollup2
HELPFUL IN HELPING US MARY DOWN

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:32.048 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.251 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE WE DON'T COLLECT

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:35.485 region:rollup2
MORE WE DON'T COLLECT LESS THAN

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.987 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:38.421 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL WE COLLECT JUST THE

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:38.955 region:rollup2
RIGHT INFORMATION THROUGH VERY

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.956 region:rollup2
OPEN TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.991 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:43.126 region:rollup2
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RIGHT

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:45.495 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND WHAT EXACTLY IS

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:47.264 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TOOL AND THAT? WERE

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.698 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY READY I MEAN TO TO

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.166 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:52.068 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DATABASE ITSELF

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:53.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU AND BUT

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:55.005 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE GOES INSIDE

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:56.640 region:rollup2
AND THEY ASK OUR IDEA OF ANOTHER

01:02:55.005 --> 01:03:01.244 region:rollup2
PAY ONE OUT IN PERSON SAYS.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.845 region:rollup2
YES I DO THEM I CAN'T IS A STAR

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.545 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ON ELIGIBLE ONE OF ONE

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:03.179 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.780 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL THEY'D WANNA VERIFY

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.914 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION I THINK THAT

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.549 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO VERIFY THE

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:08.084 region:rollup2
INFORMATION JUST LIKE WE VERIFY

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:10.587 region:rollup2
OTHER INFORMATION OUT THERE FOR

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:12.155 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SERVICES. ON THIS IS.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:14.057 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:15.091 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BARRING LOAN OF SORTS

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:17.093 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT WE WOULD DO

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.361 region:rollup2
THAT FOR OTHER LOANS AND SO IT'S

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.995 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO DO IT TO MAKE

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.131 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:22.866 region:rollup2
CONCERN. I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.034 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IDEA I THINK IT COULD

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:25.135 region:rollup2
BE DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK THAT

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:28.405 region:rollup2
COULD BE ONE OF THEM I ALSO

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:29.839 region:rollup2
THINK AND. THAT PEOPLE HOW YOU

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:32.075 region:rollup2
KNOW HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO GO GET

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.243 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ONE A DAY AND SO THE

01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:35.578 region:rollup2
IDEA IS THAT.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:37.614 region:rollup2
WHAT WHT THAT THE OF THE GOAL

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.882 region:rollup2
IS FOR THE CONSUMER TO GET THE

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:40.250 region:rollup2
RIGHT PRODUCT AND IF THE THREE

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.351 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS THE PAYDAY LOAN

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.819 region:rollup2
ITSELF ISN'T THE RIGHT PRODUCT

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.453 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND THEY NEED MORE?

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.522 region:rollup2
THAN THEY SHOULD GO DIFFERENT

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:47.724 region:rollup2
ONE AND AND ALL OF THE PRODUCTS

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:48.224 region:rollup2
OUT THERE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:50.026 region:rollup2
OF THE.

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:51.394 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS IN

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.629 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF THE

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:54.531 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S LAWS AROUND THEN

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:56.032 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

AS IN TIME YEAH I'M TRYING TO

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:59.336 region:rollup2
HELP YOUR COUSINS AT A LOT OF

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.704 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AROUND THE DATABASE SO.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.705 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHAT YOU JUST HAD SOMEONE

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.673 region:rollup2
SIGN SOMETHING SAYING THIS IS MY

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:04.474 region:rollup2
ONLY PAID A ONE WITHOUT WORK DO

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.942 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.544 region:rollup2
I KNOW SO I MEAN JUST IN THE

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.778 region:rollup2
SAME WAY THAT WE DON'T ASK OF

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:10.146 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.347 region:rollup2
EXCEEDED THEIR CREDIT YOU KNOW

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:12.415 region:rollup2
LIMIT ON THEIR CARD AND PEOPLE

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.950 region:rollup2
USE IT I THINK IT'S ALONG THE

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:15.285 region:rollup2
SAME WAY THAT SHOULD BE A SYSTEM

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:17.587 region:rollup2
IN PLACE. THAT.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.788 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW BUSINESS IS ABLE

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.823 region:rollup2
TO TRACK

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:21.024 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:22.092 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE IN TRACKING AND

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.360 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THE BUSINESSES

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.361 region:rollup2
AND COMPLIANCE AND ALSO MAKING

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.030 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE CONSUMER IS

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.932 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO THE RIGHT PRODUCT.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.266 region:rollup2
OKAY HIGH AND I I SEE THAT POINT

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:31.634 region:rollup2
I GUESS I GUESS MY THOUGHT IS

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.036 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.170 region:rollup2
WHEN TO LIE IN ORDER TO GET ONE

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.572 region:rollup2
OF THESE LOANS ARE GOING TO YOU

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.740 region:rollup2
KNOW FIND AFFINITY PER YEAR

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:37.540 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THEN THAT'S PRIDE HAVE

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.374 region:rollup2
PERSON THAT WOULD THEN BE

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.844 region:rollup2
WILLING TO GO OUT AND TRY TO

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.544 region:rollup2
FIND. YOU KNOW SOMEONE REGULATED

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:43.613 region:rollup2
TYPE OF WOUND SOME KIND OF

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:45.014 region:rollup2
WONDERING. AT HOW MUCH BENEFIT

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.349 region:rollup2
REALLY A GET OUT OF THE DATABASE

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:48.151 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE COST

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:49.185 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THERE AYE I WOULD BE

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:50.286 region:rollup2
RUNNING THE BILL IF I DIDN'T

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.787 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT.

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:53.523 region:rollup2
TO IT UPON.

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
SO I AM VERY CLEAR THAT I

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.392 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.061 region:rollup2
TO THIS I BELIEVE THAT IT IS

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.962 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOUT HELPING THE CONSUMER

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.497 region:rollup2
AND GUIDING THEM.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:02.899 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO'S

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:03.700 region:rollup2
WALKED INTO MULTIPLE OF THESE

PAID A LEN STORIES AROUND THE

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.569 region:rollup2
STATE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:08.271 region:rollup2
TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO

START TO KNOW YOUR GROCERY STORE

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.543 region:rollup2
TO. MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.210 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO COSTCO OR

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:15.311 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE

MARGARET YOU SIR BASED ON THE

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:18.181 region:rollup2

THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT PIECE FOR

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.731 region:rollup2

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.899 region:rollup2
LOANS AND FINANCES ARE IMPORTANT

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.434 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO HAVE YOU KNOW A DOUBLE

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:38.401 region:rollup2

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.035 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GETTING FOLKS INTO THE

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:41.304 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:42.972 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT THEY NEED I THINK

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:45.475 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ALSO LONG TERM A

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:46.509 region:rollup2
IMPACTS TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:48.178 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STACKING.

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:49.813 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY THERE IS A ROBUST

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:51.347 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN THE COMMITTEE

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.382 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT STACKING MEANS AND

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:54.484 region:rollup2
WHAT THE NUMBERS REALLY LOOK

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:56.553 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND HOW

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:57.854 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE ARE A HIGH

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:58.421 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS IN

01:05:57.854 --> 01:05:59.389 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THEY GET THE SAME

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.124 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:03.126 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TEN TIMES IN A ROW AT

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:04.594 region:rollup2
A FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE ON AT

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.262 region:rollup2
THAT POINT THAT SEE THAT YOU'VE

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.730 region:rollup2
ADDED AN ACCUMULATED IS MUCH

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.965 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THE LOAN ITSELF. AND

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:11.034 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.502 region:rollup2
OF AT OF PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:13.636 region:rollup2
LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:18.308 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:19.676 region:rollup2
A AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.110 region:rollup2
SOMEONE VERIFY THEMSELVES.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:21.744 region:rollup2
OF ONE OTHER THAT DISCUSS SIDE

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.345 region:rollup2
ISSUE AYE AYE KNOWS THE BILL'S

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.413 region:rollup2
TAG MAJORITY VOTE BUT THERE'S

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.113 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:26.115 region:rollup2
AFTER THE THAT.

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.283 region:rollup2
.

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:28.284 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.452 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS REALLY BENEFIT

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.353 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THE FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:31.888 region:rollup2
FOR IT IS EGGMAN LOOKED AT

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:33.356 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS IS MORE PROPERLY

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.424 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A FEAR ATTACKS AND

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.492 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:37.393 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF I JUST HATE FOR IT

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:38.461 region:rollup2
TO. GO THROUGH THE DOOR SUDDENLY

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:40.396 region:rollup2
IN IN COURT AFTERWARDS.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:41.497 region:rollup2
I I'M SORRY CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.266 region:rollup2
FEE AND WHERE DID YOU SEE THAT

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:45.068 region:rollup2
SO THE LICENSEES ARE THE FOLKS

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:45.935 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ACCESSING THE DATABASE

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.437 region:rollup2
ARE THEY.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.972 region:rollup2
I THINK IN YOUR BILL AS OPPOSED

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.439 region:rollup2
TO PAY A FEE IN ORDER TO. ACCESS

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:52.909 region:rollup2
IT.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:54.744 region:rollup2
IT'S A LICENSE.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:56.346 region:rollup2
YEAH SO WE HAVE LICENSES GET ALL

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:57.514 region:rollup2
OVER BUSINESS COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.349 region:rollup2
LICENCES THEY PLAYED THEY PAY

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:01.217 region:rollup2
FOR AN ADULT LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.785 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES NOT JUST IN THIS

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.687 region:rollup2

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:35.064 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AROSE

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:36.665 region:rollup2
FROM OUR WORK WITH IMMIGRANT

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:56.518 region:rollup2
INSTEAD SHE STARTED A BUSINESS

IN YOUR COMMUNITY SELLING HOME

01:21:13.836 --> 01:21:17.072 region:rollup2
THAT TEMPORARY FIX

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.407 region:rollup2

OUR CLIENT BECAUSE HE WAS

INCLUDING GETTING BANK LOANS.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:26.915 region:rollup2
SUCH BARRIERS PREVENTED OUR

CLIENT FROM EXPANDING HER STORE

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:29.551 region:rollup2
TO ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.353 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF

ADDITIONAL LIABILITY AND CAUSING

THE CLIENT HAD SINCE OBTAINED A

THAT REQUIRE SOCIAL SECURITY

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:54.977 region:rollup2

01:32:56.471 --> 01:32:58.540 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:32:57.205 --> 01:33:00.241 region:rollup2
SHARE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:01.576 region:rollup2
BILL AS DRAFTED.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.977 region:rollup2
I'M OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:04.345 region:rollup2
IS CENTERED AROUND THREE.

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:06.114 region:rollup2
PRIMARY POLICY ISSUES.

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:07.215 region:rollup2
NECESSITY.

01:33:06.114 --> 01:33:09.217 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT AND INNOVATION OF

01:33:07.215 --> 01:33:10.952 region:rollup2
FIRE SAFETY. AND THE UNDERLYING

01:33:09.217 --> 01:33:12.053 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:13.354 region:rollup2
THE BILL I'M GONNA TOUCH ON A

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:15.056 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THESE AND AND THEN ASK

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:16.357 region:rollup2
DR THOMAS MIGHT STOP FOR HIS HIS

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:18.760 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:19.794 region:rollup2
OF FIRST THE DEFINITION OF OF

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.696 region:rollup2
WINTERTIME CHEMICAL NOT BILL.

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:22.931 region:rollup2
IN OUR VIEW WOULD NOT ONLY

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.531 region:rollup2
RESTRICT THE USE OF THOSE WOMEN

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:25.300 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:26.801 region:rollup2
THE MARKET TODAY. BUT WAS

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.068 region:rollup2
TRICKED THE USE OF ANY FLAME

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.369 region:rollup2
RETARDANT.

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:30.038 region:rollup2
DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE.

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:30.505 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THOSE SENTENCES THAT

01:33:30.038 --> 01:33:32.874 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT YET EVEN BEEN

01:33:30.505 --> 01:33:33.775 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED.

01:33:32.874 --> 01:33:34.742 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT TAKE INTO

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:36.177 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THE RICK GARZA THEIR

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:37.912 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION HAS A

CHEMISTRY.

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:47.789 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD APPLY TO FLAME*

01:33:46.254 --> 01:33:48.990 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:50.625 region:rollup2
AND THAT BILL WOULD BE THAT THAT

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:51.993 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY WOULD BE PROHIBITED

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:53.361 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL. THERE'S

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:54.729 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT FIRE

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.663 region:rollup2
SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE STATE

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:57.799 region:rollup2

THOUGH SANDERS DON'T NECESSARILY

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:08.376 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE.

01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:08.943 region:rollup2
HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE DESIRED

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:09.911 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND AND IT IS TRUE

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:12.213 region:rollup2

FOR SMOLDERING IGNITION SOURCES

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:19.020 region:rollup2
LIKE CIGARETTES. DOES NOT AND

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.754 region:rollup2
THAT THEREFORE DOES NOT DEMAND

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.623 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THESE CHEMISTRIES

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:23.825 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SOME MANUFACTURES MAY

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:25.360 region:rollup2
FEEL. THAT THERE IS STILL VALUE

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:26.794 region:rollup2
IN USING THIS CHEMISTRIES TO

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.896 region:rollup2
IMPROVE SMOLDERING RESISTANCE OR

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:29.230 region:rollup2

LIKE CANDLES. OR DECREASE THE

01:34:31.533 --> 01:34:35.103 region:rollup2
RATE OF FIRE DEVELOPMENT WHEN

01:34:32.534 --> 01:34:36.504 region:rollup2
FURNITURE IGNITES THIS BILL

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:38.172 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:40.375 region:rollup2
SECONDLY BRIEFLY THE STATE IS

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:42.177 region:rollup2
HOME TO A UNIQUE REGULATORY

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:43.011 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED BY THE

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:44.579 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TOXICS.

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:45.780 region:rollup2
I CAN SAY FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:34:44.579 --> 01:34:47.382 region:rollup2
PROGRAM REQUIRES DTS HE TO

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.917 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO IDENTIFY

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:51.486 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE.

01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:53.054 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND IF NECESSARY

01:34:51.486 --> 01:34:53.821 region:rollup2
REGULATE CHEMICALS THEY HAVE THE

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:55.590 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:56.958 region:rollup2
TO RESTRICT THOSE.

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:58.326 region:rollup2
IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT USES

01:34:56.958 --> 01:35:00.128 region:rollup2
IN OUR VEW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:34:58.326 --> 01:35:01.796 region:rollup2
REGULATORY PROGRAM IS THE MORE

01:35:00.128 --> 01:35:03.464 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE VENUE. FOR

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:05.199 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING THESE COMPLEX

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.701 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS.

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:08.236 region:rollup2
FINALLY OF THE STATE'S EXISTING

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:09.804 region:rollup2
FURNITURE LABELING LAW ALREADY

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:11.773 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A LABEL ON RESIDENTIAL

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.041 region:rollup2
FURNITURE INFORMING CONSUMERS

01:35:11.773 --> 01:35:13.575 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT AND I DON'T

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.409 region:rollup2
CONTAINS A FLAME RETARDANT

01:35:13.575 --> 01:35:15.810 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL.

01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:17.779 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TODAY

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:19.714 region:rollup2
TO CHOOSE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN

01:35:17.779 --> 01:35:20.648 region:rollup2
FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT WE

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.350 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:23.918 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGES INNOVATION.

01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:25.220 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIALLY LIMITS CONSUMER

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:26.354 region:rollup2
CHOICE AND UNNECESSARILY

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.388 region:rollup2
RESTRICTS THE ABILITY OF

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:29.524 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO USE THESE FIRE

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:31.159 region:rollup2
SAFETY CHEMISTRIES IF THEY CHOSE

01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:32.427 region:rollup2
TO DO SO. AS A FOR THESE REASONS

01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:33.661 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE

01:35:32.427 --> 01:35:35.630 region:rollup2
TO OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:36.230 region:rollup2
CURRENT FORM THANK YOU.

01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:37.298 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.600 region:rollup2
WHEN HIS PLEASE THANK YOU VERY

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:40.702 region:rollup2
MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.303 region:rollup2
THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THOMAS

01:35:40.702 --> 01:35:43.571 region:rollup2
BETTS BY WAY OF BACKGROUND HAVE

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.572 region:rollup2
APPEASED AND TALKS COLLEGE A.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.840 region:rollup2
THE WORKING IN THE FIELD FOR

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.175 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTY YEARS I'M BOARD

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.509 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED IN THE UNITED STATES

01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:50.211 region:rollup2
AND ALSO REGISTER AS A SEX CAO

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:52.180 region:rollup2
JUST IN EUROPE. AND HERE AT THE

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:54.916 region:rollup2
REQUEST OF BCC I JUST WANT TO

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.117 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE REALLY ON

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:57.151 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE POINTS ONE.

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:57.785 region:rollup2
NOT ALL FLAME RETARDANTS ARE

01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:59.187 region:rollup2
CREATED EQUAL IN AS A

01:35:57.785 --> 01:36:00.121 region:rollup2
TOXICOLOGIST I'VE TAKEN A LOOK

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:01.289 region:rollup2
AT THE VARIETY OF FLAME

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:03.057 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS ACROSS VARIOUS

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:05.293 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL CLASSES AND SOME SICK

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:07.662 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY. CLEARLY ARE MORE

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:08.896 region:rollup2
SERIOUS. UP POTENTIAL HAS RISEN

01:36:07.662 --> 01:36:10.598 region:rollup2
RISKS AND OTHERS AND I THINK AN

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:11.599 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WAS ANALYZED

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:14.035 region:rollup2
BY THE DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.602 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OF THE US EPA ABOUT

01:36:14.035 --> 01:36:15.370 region:rollup2
THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.838 region:rollup2
THEY PUBLISHED A.

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:19.374 region:rollup2
A LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES TO

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:21.509 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM THEY

01:36:19.374 --> 01:36:23.244 region:rollup2
HAD AS SPECTRUM OF OF SAFETY IN

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:24.646 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT PROFILES AS WELL SO

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:25.880 region:rollup2
I THINK LOOKING AT THAT IS A

01:36:24.646 --> 01:36:26.848 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO AS

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.516 region:rollup2
THAN GROUPING THEM ALL TOGETHER

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:30.118 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:31.386 region:rollup2
TEMPTATION TO DO THAT AND YOU

01:36:30.118 --> 01:36:32.754 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE CARE OF A WHOLE AREA AT

01:36:31.386 --> 01:36:34.288 region:rollup2
ONCE BUT MANY OF THINGS YOU MAY

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:35.490 region:rollup2
END UP. BANNING ARE ONES WHICH

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:36.824 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AND COULD

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:38.159 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A BENEFIT AGAIN BENEFITS

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:39.994 region:rollup2
NOT MY AREA BILL THE STANDPOINT

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:41.296 region:rollup2
OF RISK I THINK THE RISK IS. IS

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:42.397 region:rollup2
MIDDLE FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS IN CERTAIN USES.

01:36:42.397 --> 01:36:45.233 region:rollup2
AND SECOND OF ALL WITH REGARD TO

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:46.768 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS IT'S AN EERIE I

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:48.569 region:rollup2
TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY OFTEN I'LL

01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:50.271 region:rollup2
GET ASKED. QUESTIONS BY

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:52.006 region:rollup2
COMPANIES IF WE DO THE FOLLOWING

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:54.642 region:rollup2
WITH THIS IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:55.143 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC OR OF USERS OR PEOPLE

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.077 region:rollup2
DOWNSTREAM FROM THE A A

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:58.146 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL.

01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:59.013 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LOOK

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:00.214 region:rollup2
AT THE FIREFIGHTERS SURE LOOKED

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:00.915 region:rollup2
AT VERY CAREFULLY THE CLEARLY IS

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.617 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:03.951 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:37:02.617 --> 01:37:05.320 region:rollup2
CANCER THERE'S NUMBER OF SLAVES

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:07.055 region:rollup2
ISSUE INCREASING CANCER A

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.323 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:37:07.055 --> 01:37:09.357 region:rollup2
WAS ONE DONE BY NINE ASH WHICH

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:10.825 region:rollup2
IS PUBLISHED THREE OR FOUR YEARS

01:37:09.357 --> 01:37:11.926 region:rollup2
AGO. LOOKING AT THIRTY THOUSAND

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:14.162 region:rollup2
CANCER IF.

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:15.596 region:rollup2
THE CITY FIREFIGHTERS AND THE

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:16.764 region:rollup2
EX IS SO INCREASES IN SEVERAL

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:18.366 region:rollup2
TYPES TYPES OF CANCER.

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:20.468 region:rollup2
RESPIRATORY CANCER WHICH THEY

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:23.438 region:rollup2
ASCRIBE TO EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS

01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:24.572 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S KIND OF CANCER

01:37:23.438 --> 01:37:25.073 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:26.407 region:rollup2
THEY NEVER MENTION FLAME

01:37:25.073 --> 01:37:28.409 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS BUT THEY DID MENTION.

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:30.311 region:rollup2
THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:31.846 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS EXPOSURES AND THIS

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:33.648 region:rollup2
GOES INCLUDING ASBESTOS AND

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.682 region:rollup2
DIESEL EXHAUST FEELS AWESOME

01:37:33.648 --> 01:37:35.883 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING WHICH UP

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.618 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:39.354 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BACK IN THE. IN THE

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:40.788 region:rollup2
FIREHOUSE THE THIS IS QUOTING

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:42.056 region:rollup2
FROM IT THE NATIONAL BE HAPPY TO

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:43.291 region:rollup2
PROVIDE IT TO YOU THE

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:44.992 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE HAVE

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:46.861 region:rollup2
EXPOSURES AND HEAVIEST BUSES AND

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:48.229 region:rollup2
DIESEL EXHAUST. AND DIGESTIVE

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:50.398 region:rollup2
CANCERS APPEAR SMALL COMPARED TO

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:51.499 region:rollup2
EFFECTS OF OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS

01:37:50.398 --> 01:37:52.800 region:rollup2
DIET WILL BE SEE FIELDS GOT

01:37:51.499 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TOBACCO USE

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.237 region:rollup2
AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WE FOUND

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:57.305 region:rollup2
SIMILAR RISK FOR ORAL FEARING

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:58.940 region:rollup2
SHE'LL ILLYRIAN SHE'LL. WHICH

01:37:57.305 --> 01:38:00.241 region:rollup2
UPPER RESPIRATORY CANCERS

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:02.243 region:rollup2
COMPARED THE US POPULATION

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:03.578 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO JUST OF CANCERS RISK

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.812 region:rollup2
FACTORS POLICE AYE TO TOBACCO

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:06.347 region:rollup2
AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WITH

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:08.683 region:rollup2
LESSER EVIDENCE THAT EXPOSURE TO

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:09.917 region:rollup2
WOOD DUST SMOKE. ASBESTOS POLY

01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:12.019 region:rollup2
AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WHICH ARE

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:15.156 region:rollup2
FOUND IN SMOKE AND ACID MISS MAY

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:15.757 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE RISK THERE'S NO

01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:16.924 region:rollup2
MENTION OF FLAME RETARDANTS.

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:17.825 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.559 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH REGARD

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:19.727 region:rollup2
TO FIREFIGHTERS IMPROVE THEIR

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.462 region:rollup2
HEALTH I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:22.764 region:rollup2
HELP AT ALL. ONE THING I THINK

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:24.132 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP IN THIS IS GETTING

01:38:22.764 --> 01:38:25.466 region:rollup2
THE AREA OF INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE

01:38:24.132 --> 01:38:27.201 region:rollup2
ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:28.536 region:rollup2
CANCER FIREFIGHTER. FIREFIGHTER

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:29.137 region:rollup2
CANCER SUPPORT NETWORK MAYBE

01:38:28.536 --> 01:38:31.439 region:rollup2
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF

01:38:29.137 --> 01:38:32.607 region:rollup2
THOSE MOST OF THOSE RELATE TO

01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:33.975 region:rollup2
HYGIENE.

01:38:32.607 --> 01:38:34.976 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH TURNOUT GEAR

01:38:33.975 --> 01:38:36.210 region:rollup2
CLINICAL EQUIPMENT VERY

01:38:34.976 --> 01:38:37.712 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL THINGS WHICH COULD BE

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:39.046 region:rollup2
DONE TOMORROW THEY DON'T REQUIRE

01:38:37.712 --> 01:38:40.414 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS TO BE BANNED IN. THE

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.916 region:rollup2
OVERTIME REMOVED IN THE MARKET

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:43.451 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMPLEX

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:44.485 region:rollup2
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BUT I MEAN

01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:45.486 region:rollup2
AS IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:46.687 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:48.289 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE FIREFIGHTERS TO

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:49.490 region:rollup2
CARCINOGENS IMMEDIATELY. THAT

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:51.159 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IT DEFTLY TAKES

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:52.360 region:rollup2
TRAINING IT TAKES MONEY AND

01:38:51.159 --> 01:38:54.896 region:rollup2
ENERGY BUT I THINK THAT WOULD

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.496 region:rollup2
CLEARLY BENEFIT THE FIREFIGHTERS

01:38:54.896 --> 01:38:56.197 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MORE THAN THIS BILL

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:57.064 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:38:56.197 --> 01:38:57.698 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:59.333 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK NEXT

01:38:57.698 --> 01:39:00.435 region:rollup2

SEATS.

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.711 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED WITH AB TWO

TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT.

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:13.481 region:rollup2
UNLESS IT'S AMENDED.

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:14.982 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE

01:39:13.481 --> 01:39:15.950 region:rollup2
PRIORITY WE DON'T MAKE PRODUCTS

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:17.618 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE THEM TO CONSUMERS

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.219 region:rollup2
FOR USE WITH INFANTS AND

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.787 region:rollup2
JUVENILES.

01:39:18.219 --> 01:39:20.621 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:22.723 region:rollup2
SAFE AND WE HAVE BEEN A LEADING

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:23.891 region:rollup2

EXCLUDE JUVENILE PRODUCTS THAT

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:33.968 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.502 region:rollup2
ADD ADD THOSE FLAME RETARDANTS.

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.369 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:39:34.502 --> 01:39:36.037 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:37.972 region:rollup2
INSTANCES OF THIS BILL

01:39:36.037 --> 01:39:39.307 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZES THAT WE'RE MANDATED

01:39:37.972 --> 01:39:40.842 region:rollup2

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:42.543 region:rollup2
TO ME TO YOU WELL STANDARD FOR

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:44.212 region:rollup2
SAFETY FOR ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

OR FOR CAR SEATS BEGIN THE BILL

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:46.681 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:48.316 region:rollup2
WERE ASKING THAT THERE BE

01:39:46.681 --> 01:39:49.584 region:rollup2
UNIFORM STATEWIDE STANDARD WITH

REGARD TO THIS ISSUE.

01:39:49.584 --> 01:39:52.720 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO'S MOVE FORWARD IN

01:39:51.219 --> 01:39:54.522 region:rollup2
THIS AREA AND THEIR THEIR BILL

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.224 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DIFFERS WITH THIS

01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:57.692 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE

01:39:56.224 --> 01:39:58.926 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE A UNIFORM STATEWIDE

01:39:57.692 --> 01:40:01.028 region:rollup2
STANDARD. SO AGAIN.

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:02.497 region:rollup2

COME FORWARD.

01:40:11.806 --> 01:40:14.342 region:rollup2
YOUR NAME. THANK YOU

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:15.209 region:rollup2
MISCALCULATION OBSOLETE.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:16.410 region:rollup2
I'M HERE TODAY FOR THE

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:18.312 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:19.680 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION. WERE NATIONAL TRADE

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:21.115 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.918 region:rollup2
MATTRESS MANUFACTURERS.

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:25.520 region:rollup2
NOW WE AGREE WITH MR BLOOM IN

01:40:23.918 --> 01:40:26.787 region:rollup2
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL OUT

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.356 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TO THAT.

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:29.223 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THERE ARE BAD THIS IS

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:30.258 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE VERY QUICK THAT

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:31.692 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BAD CHEMICALS THAT

01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:32.960 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.929 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY HE

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.530 region:rollup2
DEFINES CHEMICALS IN THIS BILL.

01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:38.232 region:rollup2
WHICH SAYS THAT.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.700 region:rollup2
FIRE RETARDANT CHEMICAL MEANS

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:41.168 region:rollup2
ANY CHEMICAL THE CONTRIBUTES TO

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.571 region:rollup2
RETURNING FIRE.

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:45.673 region:rollup2
IS SO BROAD THAT COMPLETELY

01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:47.141 region:rollup2
INERT THINGS LIKE SAND SILICA

01:40:45.673 --> 01:40:48.943 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DO USE OUR MATTRESSES

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:51.112 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T USE UNDER HIS BILL. SO

01:40:48.943 --> 01:40:52.680 region:rollup2
THE DILEMMA PUTS THE MATTRESS

01:40:51.112 --> 01:40:53.848 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES AND IS THAT.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.049 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T

01:40:53.848 --> 01:40:56.250 region:rollup2
USE THE BROMINATED FIRE

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:58.052 region:rollup2
RETARDANT CITIES CONCERNED ABOUT

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:58.920 region:rollup2
OF THEIR CANDLE HALOGENS OR SOME

01:40:58.052 --> 01:41:00.488 region:rollup2
OF THESE OTHER CHEMICAL

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.657 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDS FOR THE PROBLEMS.

01:41:00.488 --> 01:41:04.792 region:rollup2
EVEN THE BENIGN COMPOUNDS

01:41:02.657 --> 01:41:06.594 region:rollup2
THAT WE MUST USE TO MEET FEDERAL

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:08.529 region:rollup2
OPEN FLAME STANDARDS AND TO MEET

01:41:06.594 --> 01:41:09.931 region:rollup2
FEDERAL SMOLDERING CIGARETTE

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:12.934 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WE CAN'T USE THE

01:41:09.931 --> 01:41:14.535 region:rollup2
BENIGN UP A CHEMICAL STRATEGIES.

01:41:12.934 --> 01:41:16.404 region:rollup2
UNDER HIS BILL SO IF HIS BILLS

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.938 region:rollup2
ENACTED THE WAY IT IS TODAY.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:18.205 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T MEET THE FEDERAL

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:19.240 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:20.241 region:rollup2
AND IF WE USE THE PRODUCTS THAT

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.208 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MEET THE FEDERAL

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:22.476 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT WE CAN'T MEET

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.844 region:rollup2
MISTER BLOOM STANDARD THIS IN

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:25.413 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT.

01:41:23.844 --> 01:41:26.814 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL IT'S IT SOUNDS

01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:27.682 region:rollup2
GREAT TO GET BAD CHEMICALS OUT

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.383 region:rollup2
OF FURNITURE MATTRESSES WERE ALL

01:41:27.682 --> 01:41:31.152 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:32.620 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAPPEN TO USE THOSE AND

01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:33.287 region:rollup2
THE BUT NINE CHEMICALS THAT WE

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.522 region:rollup2
DO USE WOULD BE COMPLETELY

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:35.656 region:rollup2
OUTLAWED BY THIS BILL SO WE'RE

01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:37.592 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE TO REACH SOME SORT

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:38.893 region:rollup2
OF CONCLUSION.

01:41:37.592 --> 01:41:40.294 region:rollup2

TODAY'S HEARING IS TO REALLY SIT

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:27.995 region:rollup2
DOWN AND TRY TO WORK ON THE

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:30.197 region:rollup2
DEFINITION A LITTLE BIT. LA I DO

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:31.432 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT THAT IT MAY HAVE TO

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:33.033 region:rollup2

THE ISSUE REGARDING THE TSC. I

01:44:48.616 --> 01:44:52.353 region:rollup2
THE TSC WOULD BE GUARANTEED TO

01:44:50.351 --> 01:44:53.354 region:rollup2

IN LIGHT OF THAT THE BODY OF

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:05.933 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE THAT

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:08.769 region:rollup2
INDICATES THAT THAT THESE

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:11.972 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. AND

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:13.174 region:rollup2

01:59:19.653 --> 01:59:22.856 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I WANTED

01:59:21.688 --> 01:59:24.891 region:rollup2
TO. MAKE YOU AWARE OF.

01:59:22.856 --> 01:59:27.127 region:rollup2
.

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:28.595 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT.

01:59:27.127 --> 01:59:30.497 region:rollup2
THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NEED

01:59:28.595 --> 01:59:32.399 region:rollup2
SOME CLARIFICATION AND TO START

01:59:30.497 --> 01:59:33.633 region:rollup2
WITH I THINK. THAT YOU NEED TO

01:59:32.399 --> 01:59:35.235 region:rollup2
CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:36.236 region:rollup2
SAY CHARITABLE PURPOSE.

01:59:35.235 --> 01:59:38.571 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT DEFINED

01:59:36.236 --> 01:59:40.106 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE IN THE BILL AND.

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:41.207 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE REFERENCING WHERE

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:42.475 region:rollup2
IT'S DEFINED IN DIFFERENT PEER

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:44.177 region:rollup2
PART OF STATE CODE I THINK THAT

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:45.712 region:rollup2
YOU ARE EXPLICITLY SAY TERRIBLE

01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:47.414 region:rollup2
PURPOSE AS DEFINED IN SECTION

01:59:45.712 --> 01:59:48.348 region:rollup2
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. NOT OR IF

01:59:47.414 --> 01:59:49.416 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO COME UP WITH YOUR

01:59:48.348 --> 01:59:50.216 region:rollup2
OWN DEFINITION I THINK YOU

01:59:49.416 --> 01:59:51.518 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO WITH THEIR THE SECTION

01:59:50.216 --> 01:59:52.719 region:rollup2
BUT I CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T DON'T

01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:54.487 region:rollup2
THINK THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT

01:59:52.719 --> 01:59:56.756 region:rollup2
UP TO. INTERPRETATION WHAT

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:59.659 region:rollup2
EXACTLY A CHARITABLE PURPOSE IS.

01:59:56.756 --> 02:00:01.327 region:rollup2
ARM AND IN A BROADER SENSE.

01:59:59.659 --> 02:00:02.695 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THAT.

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:05.432 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:08.468 region:rollup2
THE ADVENT OF CROWDFUNDING LENDS

02:00:05.432 --> 02:00:10.203 region:rollup2
ITSELF TO. A MUCH MORE LOCAL AND

02:00:08.468 --> 02:00:11.271 region:rollup2
SMALL SCALE KIND OF TRANSACTION

02:00:10.203 --> 02:00:14.207 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:00:11.271 --> 02:00:15.775 region:rollup2
DONORS AND CHARITABLE CAUSES

02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:17.477 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT AS WE TRY

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:19.946 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT.

02:00:17.477 --> 02:00:21.681 region:rollup2
THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WE DON'T

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:22.615 region:rollup2
STIFLE THAT ACTIVITY AND I'LL

02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:23.950 region:rollup2
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:25.752 region:rollup2
THING THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:27.320 region:rollup2
SO IF I'M.

02:00:25.752 --> 02:00:28.822 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RAISE MONEY BECAUSE I

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.456 region:rollup2
FIND OUT A FRIEND HAS CANCER AND

02:00:28.822 --> 02:00:31.825 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT HE CAN'T SUPPORT HIS

02:00:29.456 --> 02:00:34.527 region:rollup2
FAMILY. DURING THIS TRYING TIME

02:00:31.825 --> 02:00:36.529 region:rollup2
SO ARE DOES THAT MAKE ME. A.

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:37.864 region:rollup2
.

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:39.132 region:rollup2
A CROWD FUNDING SOLICITOR

IT ON MY OWN. BUT IT SURE SEEMS

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:50.210 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT'S NOT A CIRCUMSTANCE

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:52.112 region:rollup2
WHERE THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST

02:00:50.210 --> 02:00:52.645 region:rollup2
IN REQUIRING THAT PERSON TO

02:00:52.112 --> 02:00:52.912 region:rollup2
REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY

IF YOU ALONG THAT SAME LINE I

02:01:01.588 --> 02:01:03.590 region:rollup2
MEAN I REALIZE IT'S KIND OF A

02:01:02.856 --> 02:01:05.458 region:rollup2
WORST CASE SCENARIO BUT.

02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:07.427 region:rollup2
I MEAN LET'S SAY BECAUSE THAT

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:08.962 region:rollup2
YOUR BILL SAYS THAT. THAT MAKES

02:01:07.427 --> 02:01:11.064 region:rollup2

02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:51.310 region:rollup2
FLAW. WE THINK THIS BILL IS

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:52.845 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY CALIFORNIA ALREADY

THAT SAME DAY REGISTRATION THAT

02:11:17.503 --> 02:11:20.606 region:rollup2
HAS GONE INTO A FACT WHICH

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:22.575 region:rollup2
ALLOWS VOTERS TO CLEAN UP THEIR

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT MY CONCERN

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:17.630 region:rollup2
IS ALSO THE FACT THAT.

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.464 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT

.

02:12:29.208 --> 02:12:33.579 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED

02:12:30.943 --> 02:12:35.080 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE.

02:12:33.579 --> 02:12:36.549 region:rollup2

RELEVANT UP TO DATE IN AND CLEAN

02:12:38.184 --> 02:12:40.519 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THE SAME TIME WHEN IT

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:41.253 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T WHEN WE COME TO THIS

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:42.621 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WE'RE GETTING THESE

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:44.490 region:rollup2
PRIVACY ISSUES. I'M JUST

02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:46.125 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WE DON'T HAVE. ANY

02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:47.459 region:rollup2
LEGAL RECOURSE TO PREVENT OUR

02:12:46.125 --> 02:12:48.360 region:rollup2

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:50.095 region:rollup2
TURN OVER.

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:51.230 region:rollup2
WHETHER CHECK BY THE SECRETARY

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:52.298 region:rollup2
OF STATE OR NOT.

02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:53.799 region:rollup2
TO BE SHARED WITHOUT OUR

02:12:52.298 --> 02:12:55.334 region:rollup2
CONSENT IN THAT WE WOULD HAVE NO

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:56.769 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CONTROL THAT ONCE A

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:59.138 region:rollup2
DECISION HAD BEEN MADE.

02:12:56.769 --> 02:12:59.405 region:rollup2
I COMPLETELY RESPECT THAT

02:12:59.138 --> 02:13:01.607 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

02:12:59.405 --> 02:13:04.443 region:rollup2
.

02:13:01.607 --> 02:13:05.911 region:rollup2
THE ERIC DECLARE IT IS A

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:07.346 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SEPARATE ORGANIZATION

02:13:05.911 --> 02:13:09.048 region:rollup2
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:11.884 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION

02:13:09.048 --> 02:13:13.953 region:rollup2
IS ORGAN ORGANIZATION. THAT IS

02:13:11.884 --> 02:13:15.754 region:rollup2
OWNED BY AND CONTROLLED BY THE

02:13:13.953 --> 02:13:17.189 region:rollup2
STATES THAT. MAKE UP THE

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:18.591 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION SO WE CALIFORNIA

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:19.592 region:rollup2
SHOULD I JOIN WOULD BECOME A

02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:21.660 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF ERIC NOW YOU'RE

02:13:19.592 --> 02:13:22.895 region:rollup2
CORRECT THAT BECAUSE WE WERE NOT

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.330 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST TWENTY STATES

02:13:22.895 --> 02:13:26.031 region:rollup2
WE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:27.066 region:rollup2
ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:28.367 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A

02:13:27.066 --> 02:13:29.702 region:rollup2
BILL WAS INTRODUCED LAST SESSION

02:13:28.367 --> 02:13:30.903 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME

02:13:29.702 --> 02:13:32.638 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION THAT WAS HELD IN

02:13:30.903 --> 02:13:34.139 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS AND REALLY COST

02:13:32.638 --> 02:13:36.008 region:rollup2
US THAT OPPORTUNITY HOWEVER

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:36.942 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID THAT. I AM ONE

02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:38.911 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN THAT

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:40.946 region:rollup2
ERIC IS VERY MOTIVATED

02:13:38.911 --> 02:13:42.781 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:43.382 region:rollup2
STATES.

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.817 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY LARGE STATES LIKE

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:46.252 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE THEIR CONCERNS

02:13:44.817 --> 02:13:47.119 region:rollup2
MET.

02:13:46.252 --> 02:13:48.220 region:rollup2
AND.

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.922 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:51.957 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO

02:13:49.922 --> 02:13:53.692 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT.

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:54.894 region:rollup2
IF IF WE WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:56.562 region:rollup2
PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT THEY

02:13:54.894 --> 02:13:58.297 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE WHICH

02:13:56.562 --> 02:13:59.698 region:rollup2
ARE EXTENSIVE. THAT SHOULD WE

02:13:58.297 --> 02:14:01.834 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:02.368 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO I AM VERY CONFIDENT

02:14:01.834 --> 02:14:04.236 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD SERIOUSLY

02:14:02.368 --> 02:14:05.938 region:rollup2
CONSIDER DOING THAT DOWN IF THE

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:07.740 region:rollup2
WORST. WERE TO COME TO PLAY TO

02:14:05.938 --> 02:14:09.074 region:rollup2
TO PASS IN THE SITUATION THAT

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.543 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SEE UNFOLDS WHERE WE

02:14:09.074 --> 02:14:13.145 region:rollup2
DISAGREE. WITH SOME WAY THAT

02:14:11.543 --> 02:14:15.014 region:rollup2
THAT DATA IS BEING USED THEY ON

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:16.282 region:rollup2
OUR I'M I'M SURE THE SECRETARY

02:14:15.014 --> 02:14:18.017 region:rollup2
OF STATE WOULD BE POLICE IN THAT

02:14:16.282 --> 02:14:19.385 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND BRING IT TO OUR

02:14:18.017 --> 02:14:21.086 region:rollup2
ATTENTION. THE AND WE WOULD

02:14:19.385 --> 02:14:22.087 region:rollup2
CORRECT IT AND IF NECESSARY

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:24.056 region:rollup2
WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTNERSHIP.

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:26.692 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE.

02:14:24.056 --> 02:14:27.593 region:rollup2
REALLY QUICK SUMMARY.

02:14:26.692 --> 02:14:29.561 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN YOUR OPENING

02:14:27.593 --> 02:14:30.763 region:rollup2
STATEMENT.

02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:32.231 region:rollup2
FOR THE CAKE FOR THE STATE OF

02:14:30.763 --> 02:14:34.633 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHAT WOULD YOU

02:14:32.231 --> 02:14:37.036 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AS THE SINGLE GREATEST.

02:14:34.633 --> 02:14:39.138 region:rollup2
BENEFIT TO JOINING THE SYSTEM

02:14:37.036 --> 02:14:41.440 region:rollup2
BUT TO ME THIS IS ABOUT CIVIC

02:14:39.138 --> 02:14:43.042 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT AND IF YOU READ THE

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:43.809 region:rollup2
PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSIONS REPORT

02:14:43.042 --> 02:14:46.011 region:rollup2
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:47.880 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED ON THAT'S. THAT'S

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:49.448 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF. OF

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:50.215 region:rollup2
THEIR IN THEIR IMPROVEMENTS

02:14:49.448 --> 02:14:52.251 region:rollup2
SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS THE AUTORE

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.785 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS TO GET MORE PEOPLE

02:14:52.251 --> 02:14:53.986 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF

02:14:52.785 --> 02:14:54.620 region:rollup2
VOTING.

02:14:53.986 --> 02:14:56.188 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:57.523 region:rollup2
SELECT SUCH WOULD ALLOW US TO DO

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:59.091 region:rollup2
THIS MEMBERSHIP. IS TO

02:14:57.523 --> 02:15:00.893 region:rollup2
PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO PEOPLE

02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:02.094 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE MOVED HERE AND OFFER

02:15:00.893 --> 02:15:03.262 region:rollup2
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER

02:15:02.094 --> 02:15:04.997 region:rollup2
TO VOTE BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT'S

02:15:03.262 --> 02:15:06.465 region:rollup2
ALL IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO.

02:15:04.997 --> 02:15:07.666 region:rollup2
TO PUSH SOMEONE OVER THE EDGE

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:09.468 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN THE

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:10.703 region:rollup2
ELECTORAL PROCESS IN THE NEW

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:12.037 region:rollup2
STATE THAT THEY'RE MOVING. SO IF

02:15:10.703 --> 02:15:13.539 region:rollup2
WE CAN ENGAGE THOSE PEOPLE TWO

02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:14.907 region:rollup2
OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS EARLIER

02:15:13.539 --> 02:15:16.408 region:rollup2
THAN WE NORMALLY WHAT I THINK

02:15:14.907 --> 02:15:17.710 region:rollup2
IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR US. AND

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:19.979 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO ALL THE

02:15:17.710 --> 02:15:24.149 region:rollup2
OTHER BENEFITS THEY'RE CLEANING

02:15:19.979 --> 02:15:25.417 region:rollup2
UP THE VOTER ROLLS WOULD HAVE.

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:26.585 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL

I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE BUT

02:15:32.758 --> 02:15:35.561 region:rollup2

COMFORTABLE GOING UP ON THIS AT.

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.965 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:41.567 region:rollup2
.

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:43.335 region:rollup2
FOR THE. WHEN THE BILL CAME UP

02:15:41.567 --> 02:15:44.403 region:rollup2
LAST TIME LAST YEAR I ALSO

02:15:43.335 --> 02:15:46.005 region:rollup2
STAYED OFF.

02:15:44.403 --> 02:15:48.841 region:rollup2
WASN'T CONCERNED ABOUT THE.

02:15:46.005 --> 02:15:49.641 region:rollup2
THE BILL ITSELF ARE AND AND OUR

02:15:48.841 --> 02:15:51.076 region:rollup2
A AND I THINK THERE ARE

02:15:49.641 --> 02:15:52.778 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HANDLING

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:53.979 region:rollup2
THIS AND. AND I THINK IT'S BEEN

02:15:52.778 --> 02:15:55.347 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT THE WISCONSIN

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:57.983 region:rollup2
INCIDENT THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:59.218 region:rollup2

02:16:32.418 --> 02:16:34.820 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN WISCONSIN BECAUSE I

02:16:34.353 --> 02:16:36.622 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S BEEN A

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:37.990 region:rollup2
MISPERCEPTION THAT THAT WAS

02:16:36.622 --> 02:16:39.358 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ERIC'S INVOLVEMENT

02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:40.726 region:rollup2
AND ALTHOUGH THOSE VOTERS WERE

02:16:39.358 --> 02:16:41.760 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:16:40.726 --> 02:16:43.595 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:46.031 region:rollup2
ERIC IT WAS THE STATE OF

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:47.099 region:rollup2
WISCONSIN WHO ELECTED TO SEND

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:48.734 region:rollup2

REMOVED FROM THE DATABASE THAT

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:56.375 region:rollup2

02:16:58.010 --> 02:17:01.180 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT OCCUR

02:16:59.078 --> 02:17:03.015 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ABSENT

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.016 region:rollup2
THAT ACTION BY WISCONSIN THERE

02:17:03.015 --> 02:17:05.617 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THEIR

02:17:04.016 --> 02:17:06.518 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THOSE VOTERS SO IS

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:07.986 region:rollup2
ONE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT I

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:10.355 region:rollup2
MEAN ERIC. IS JUST A PURVEYOR OF

I MEAN IT'S IT'S MY. POOR ASKING

02:27:08.787 --> 02:27:11.823 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF SO I

02:27:10.555 --> 02:27:13.325 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT ONE I READ.

02:27:11.823 --> 02:27:14.926 region:rollup2
WE TRY AND THAT IS AND LESS

02:27:13.325 --> 02:27:15.960 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DATE.

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:17.495 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE THAT IT IS

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.430 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY A SOFTWARE UPDATE

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:19.964 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE

OPPOSED TO. A RESPONSE THAT IS

02:27:24.436 --> 02:27:29.341 region:rollup2
EITHER INDUSTRY STANDARD OR BEST

02:27:27.072 --> 02:27:30.375 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OR WHAT WOULD BE A

02:27:29.341 --> 02:27:31.710 region:rollup2
REASONABLE PERSON'S

02:27:30.375 --> 02:27:33.345 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION WHAT'S THE BEST

02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:34.879 region:rollup2
WAY TO RESPOND IT GIVES THE

02:27:33.345 --> 02:27:37.015 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OR WHATEVER ISSUES MAY

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:38.283 region:rollup2
BE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT

02:27:37.015 --> 02:27:40.118 region:rollup2
IS PASSED AND IT MAY NOT BE A

02:27:38.283 --> 02:27:40.719 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE UPDATED AB THAT'S ONE

02:27:40.118 --> 02:27:42.687 region:rollup2
OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN RAISED

02:27:40.719 --> 02:27:45.457 region:rollup2
BY THE OPPOSITION IT IT MAY BE

02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:46.691 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MATTER. THAT WE SHOULD

02:27:45.457 --> 02:27:48.426 region:rollup2
NOT BE SO DETAILED AND.

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:49.527 region:rollup2
I THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING WHY

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:51.062 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T USE THAT STANDARD

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:53.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S FAIRLY PREVALENT IN THE

02:27:51.062 --> 02:27:56.368 region:rollup2
LAW. AND IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE

02:27:53.798 --> 02:27:57.769 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THAT IS FLUID AND

02:27:56.368 --> 02:27:59.371 region:rollup2
ISN'T SO RIGID IS TO HAVE

02:27:57.769 --> 02:28:01.206 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE UPDATE MUST BE DONE

02:27:59.371 --> 02:28:02.874 region:rollup2
THIS WAY.

02:28:01.206 --> 02:28:05.043 region:rollup2
BOB YEAH IN FACT THE BEST

02:28:02.874 --> 02:28:06.311 region:rollup2
PRACTICE LANGUAGE IS PART OF THE

02:28:05.043 --> 02:28:08.213 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AS WELL.

02:28:06.311 --> 02:28:11.216 region:rollup2
UP SO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

02:28:08.213 --> 02:28:14.052 region:rollup2
IGNORING WHAT THE INDUSTRY DOES.

02:28:11.216 --> 02:28:15.720 region:rollup2
SO SIMPLY SAYING THAT HE LOOK.

02:28:14.052 --> 02:28:17.522 region:rollup2
DO THIS THING WITHIN THE.

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:19.357 region:rollup2
THE PURVIEW OF THE BEST

02:28:17.522 --> 02:28:20.925 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OF THE INDUSTRY BUT

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:21.926 region:rollup2
START THE PROCESS SO YOU KNOW

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:23.428 region:rollup2
WITHIN THREE DAYS OF OF A

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:25.130 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION GIVE IT IS THE

02:28:23.428 --> 02:28:26.331 region:rollup2
THING THAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO

02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:30.535 region:rollup2
DO IS TO.

02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:31.636 region:rollup2
USE A SOFTWARE UPDATE.

02:28:30.535 --> 02:28:32.737 region:rollup2
WE ARE SORRY WHEN I'M THAT'S IS

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:34.305 region:rollup2
SO IS THE THING THAT THEY'RE

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:36.908 region:rollup2
BEING ASKED TO DO THOSE TO BE A

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:38.676 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE UPDATE AS OPPOSED TO. A

02:28:36.908 --> 02:28:40.378 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:41.780 region:rollup2
CORRECT AM RIGHT AND AND WE ALSO

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:43.882 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER THE AMENDMENTS WERE

02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:44.983 region:rollup2
ALSO ASKING THE TO COMPANY TO.

02:28:43.882 --> 02:28:47.385 region:rollup2
ARE START THE.

02:28:44.983 --> 02:28:49.521 region:rollup2
MITIGATION ARE A PROCESS ALSO

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:50.088 region:rollup2
TO YOU WE DON'T WANT IT WE DON'T

02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:50.955 region:rollup2
WANT TO CREATE A PATCH THAT

02:28:50.088 --> 02:28:52.424 region:rollup2
WOULD.

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:54.859 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE THE SITUATION FIRST

02:28:52.424 --> 02:28:56.027 region:rollup2
OF ALL OUGHT TO THE IDEA IS TO

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:57.328 region:rollup2
START THE BALL ROLLING BUT YET

02:28:56.027 --> 02:28:59.164 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME IMPLEMENT SOME

02:28:57.328 --> 02:29:01.499 region:rollup2
KIND OF MITIGATION MEASURES TO

02:28:59.164 --> 02:29:04.202 region:rollup2
REDUCE YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL.

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:06.104 region:rollup2
OF HAVING A YOU KNOW. THE PAKSHA

02:29:04.202 --> 02:29:06.771 region:rollup2
CREATING PROBLEMS OR OR JUST

02:29:06.104 --> 02:29:08.873 region:rollup2
STOP YOU KNOW BASICALLY STOP THE

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:10.542 region:rollup2
BLEEDING. OKAY A POINT ON THANK

02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:12.010 region:rollup2
YOU TYPOLOGIES SO I'M AND

02:29:10.542 --> 02:29:13.077 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THAT GOES TO THE

02:29:12.010 --> 02:29:14.779 region:rollup2
OTHER POINT THE OPPOSITION'S

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:16.815 region:rollup2
RAISED IS THAT THERE MAY BE IF

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:19.317 region:rollup2
WE ARE SO SPECIFIC AS TO SAY IT

02:29:16.815 --> 02:29:19.784 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A SOFTWARE UPDATE.

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:20.585 region:rollup2
OR A SOFTWARE PATCH.

02:29:19.784 --> 02:29:23.054 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

02:29:20.585 --> 02:29:24.656 region:rollup2
.

02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:25.890 region:rollup2
DOES NOT PROVIDE. THE

02:29:24.656 --> 02:29:26.891 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO EITHER ADDRESS

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:28.359 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM MAY DESTABILIZE THE

02:29:26.891 --> 02:29:29.627 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:31.129 region:rollup2
I'VE CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:33.665 region:rollup2
AS WELL BECAUSE I MY UNDERLINGS

02:29:31.129 --> 02:29:35.567 region:rollup2
IN YEARS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WHAT

02:29:33.665 --> 02:29:37.402 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THAT WHAT INSPIRED YOUR

02:29:35.567 --> 02:29:38.970 region:rollup2
BILL IS COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE

02:29:37.402 --> 02:29:40.471 region:rollup2
AND THERE SHOULD BE A VERY

02:29:38.970 --> 02:29:42.006 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND JUST.

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:43.107 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S ALMOST A NEGLIGENCE

02:29:42.006 --> 02:29:43.641 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT WE SHOULD USE HERE

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:45.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I JUST SCREAMED OF

02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:47.312 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:49.013 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T USUALLY JUDGE WHAT

02:29:47.312 --> 02:29:51.483 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:53.451 region:rollup2
BY DID YOU DO ONE SPECIFIC

02:29:51.483 --> 02:29:54.886 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIVE RESPONSE AS OPPOSED

02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:56.254 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WAS PASSED IN THE

02:29:54.886 --> 02:29:57.555 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION HAS RAISED A POINT

02:29:56.254 --> 02:29:59.357 region:rollup2
THAT A SOFTWARE UPDATE MAY NOT

02:29:57.555 --> 02:30:01.626 region:rollup2
BE THE BEST OPTION.

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:03.228 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT?

02:30:01.626 --> 02:30:04.629 region:rollup2
WELL A SOFTWARE UPDATE MAY NOT

02:30:03.228 --> 02:30:06.197 region:rollup2
BE THE BEST SOLUTION BUT YET I

02:30:04.629 --> 02:30:07.699 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING IN THE

02:30:06.197 --> 02:30:09.934 region:rollup2
BILL IS TO FOR THE COMPANY TO

02:30:07.699 --> 02:30:12.470 region:rollup2
START.

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:13.771 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING START THE PROCESS.

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:16.040 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:16.674 region:rollup2
APPLYING THAT PATCH

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:18.610 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:20.411 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SO YOU KNOW WE DO

02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:21.613 region:rollup2
PROVIDE YOU KNOW A A A A A A

02:30:20.411 --> 02:30:23.081 region:rollup2
TIME PERIOD WHERE THEY HAVE TO

02:30:21.613 --> 02:30:24.682 region:rollup2
EVALUATE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE

02:30:23.081 --> 02:30:26.551 region:rollup2
COMPANY. A WEATHER NOT A ONE

02:30:24.682 --> 02:30:28.286 region:rollup2
APPLY TO GET UP TO PATCH ME THE

02:30:26.551 --> 02:30:29.087 region:rollup2
THE THE THE BILL ITSELF ALSO

02:30:28.286 --> 02:30:31.456 region:rollup2
DOZEN REALLY.

02:30:29.087 --> 02:30:32.590 region:rollup2
PENALIZE THE COMPANY IF THERE'S

02:30:31.456 --> 02:30:33.491 region:rollup2
NO PREACH.

02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:36.127 region:rollup2
SO.

02:30:33.491 --> 02:30:38.463 region:rollup2
IF IF IT'S IF THE COMPANY DEEMS

02:30:36.127 --> 02:30:40.098 region:rollup2
IT ARE PROPER TO NOT APPLY THE

02:30:38.463 --> 02:30:41.866 region:rollup2
PATCH IN THEIR SITUATION IT'S

02:30:40.098 --> 02:30:42.433 region:rollup2
THEIR PREROGATIVE ALSO BUT IT SO

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:42.667 region:rollup2
LONG AS IT DOESN'T CAUSE ANY

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:44.736 region:rollup2
BREACH.

02:30:42.667 --> 02:30:45.336 region:rollup2
AND FUTURE.

02:30:44.736 --> 02:30:46.838 region:rollup2
THINKING THERE IF THERE'S NO

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:48.439 region:rollup2
CONNECTION THERE'S A NEXT NO

02:30:46.838 --> 02:30:49.941 region:rollup2
NEXUS BETWEEN APPLYING A PATCH

02:30:48.439 --> 02:30:52.577 region:rollup2
TO THE ULTIMATE BREACH THEN

02:30:49.941 --> 02:30:55.013 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO LIABILITY.

02:30:52.577 --> 02:30:55.580 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:30:55.013 --> 02:30:59.250 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:30:55.580 --> 02:31:00.251 region:rollup2
MISTER OBERNOLTE.

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:01.920 region:rollup2
SEVERAL THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT

02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:02.887 region:rollup2
SHOULD I DO AND I AM SUPPORTIVE

02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:04.589 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL IN GENERAL JUST HAD

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:06.357 region:rollup2
IT A COUPLE OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS

02:31:04.589 --> 02:31:07.692 region:rollup2
THAT I HOPE ARE HELPFUL. SARAH

02:31:06.357 --> 02:31:08.526 region:rollup2
AND.

02:31:07.692 --> 02:31:08.760 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR TO WHAT I'VE SAID

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:10.561 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:11.095 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:12.497 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO AVOID

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:14.332 region:rollup2
AMBIGUITY. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

02:31:12.497 --> 02:31:15.500 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES

02:31:14.332 --> 02:31:16.968 region:rollup2
THROUGH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.603 region:rollup2
ARE SO SERIOUS FOR THE PEOPLE

02:31:16.968 --> 02:31:19.938 region:rollup2
WHO VIOLATED THIS.

02:31:18.603 --> 02:31:22.040 region:rollup2
PROPOSED LAW SO.

02:31:19.938 --> 02:31:23.341 region:rollup2
I THINK WHEN WE SAY SECURITY

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:25.043 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY WE NEED WHEN YOU

02:31:23.341 --> 02:31:26.678 region:rollup2
MIGHT NEEDS TO DEFINE EXACTLY

02:31:25.043 --> 02:31:27.946 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU MEAN. BY VULNERABILITY

02:31:26.678 --> 02:31:29.981 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A SUPERFICIAL

02:31:27.946 --> 02:31:31.449 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY IS NOT SOMETHING

02:31:29.981 --> 02:31:33.084 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO TARGET

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:35.019 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WHEN.

02:31:33.084 --> 02:31:36.020 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU SAY A BREACH OF

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:37.622 region:rollup2
SECURITY I THINK YOU NEED TO

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.223 region:rollup2
DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS

02:31:37.622 --> 02:31:40.258 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A SUPERFICIAL BREACH OF

02:31:39.223 --> 02:31:41.993 region:rollup2
SECURITY I DON'T THINK YOU'D

02:31:40.258 --> 02:31:43.494 region:rollup2
WANT TO TRIGGER THIS.

02:31:41.993 --> 02:31:44.629 region:rollup2
I AND I ALSO THINK THAT THAT YOU

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:45.830 region:rollup2
MIGHT ITS DEFINITION ON EXACTLY

02:31:44.629 --> 02:31:47.899 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY

02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:49.100 region:rollup2
AN INJURY HAS OCCURRED. THAT

02:31:47.899 --> 02:31:49.801 region:rollup2
TRIGGERS THIS PRIDE RIGHT AFFECT

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:50.702 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE

02:31:49.801 --> 02:31:52.870 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

02:31:50.702 --> 02:31:53.504 region:rollup2
SUPERFICIAL INJURY IS NOT

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:54.872 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TARGETING

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:56.474 region:rollup2
BUT OTHER THOSE ARE JUST

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:57.542 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS ON HAVING A SPORT

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:59.110 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL TODAY.

02:31:57.542 --> 02:32:00.745 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND WE

02:31:59.110 --> 02:32:01.980 region:rollup2
DO INTEND THAT KIND OF FINE TUNE

02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:03.881 region:rollup2
THE BILL AS WE GO ALONG AND IF

02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:06.017 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE DATE AND AND. AND.

YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OPEN TO

02:32:07.385 --> 02:32:09.654 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:12.090 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT'S PASS.

02:32:09.654 --> 02:32:13.091 region:rollup2
FOR THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AS

02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:15.193 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS WHAT HE FOR THE

02:32:13.091 --> 02:32:15.760 region:rollup2
CONSUMER SO WE DON'T WANT TO. WE

02:32:15.193 --> 02:32:16.728 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO JAM SOMETHING

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:17.695 region:rollup2
DOWN.

02:32:16.728 --> 02:32:19.964 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY'RE CUT THE THROAT

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:21.666 region:rollup2
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OF IT YOU

02:32:19.964 --> 02:32:23.034 region:rollup2
KNOW EXACERBATING SITUATION.

02:32:21.666 --> 02:32:26.504 region:rollup2
SO I GLOBAL POINT WELL TAKEN.

02:32:23.034 --> 02:32:27.438 region:rollup2
I DON'T HOUSE.

02:32:26.504 --> 02:32:28.639 region:rollup2
SHALL WE GET CLOSE

THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:33.911 region:rollup2
AND I I THINK.

ICE I WANNA CONTINUE WORKING

02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:36.114 region:rollup2

OUT YOU KNOW TO FIND THAT SWEET

02:32:36.114 --> 02:32:39.784 region:rollup2
SPOT.

02:32:37.949 --> 02:32:41.352 region:rollup2

OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OR

02:32:45.390 --> 02:32:49.193 region:rollup2
DEEPLY SHAKEN. BY THE BREACH THE

02:32:47.291 --> 02:32:50.762 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO BUT I THINK MS BAKER

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:52.030 region:rollup2
HAD THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THAT I

02:32:50.762 --> 02:32:53.331 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T THINK A PER SE RULE.

02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:54.732 region:rollup2
AYE THAT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS

02:32:53.331 --> 02:32:55.333 region:rollup2
DAMAGES MAKES SENSE IN THIS

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:56.200 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

02:32:55.333 --> 02:32:57.735 region:rollup2

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:59.470 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T GET THE INCENTIVES

02:32:57.735 --> 02:33:00.972 region:rollup2
RIGHT AYE TO MAXIMIZE SECURITY

02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:01.606 region:rollup2

THAT THE PATIENT IS INGESTING

02:38:49.954 --> 02:38:52.890 region:rollup2
THE MEDICATION THEY'RE SUPPOSED

02:38:50.788 --> 02:38:54.725 region:rollup2
TO TAKE WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:56.026 region:rollup2
TO TAKE IT. AYE AND TRACK THAT.

02:38:54.725 --> 02:38:57.361 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF COST OF THE

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:59.230 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM

02:38:57.361 --> 02:39:00.197 region:rollup2
MEDICATION NON ADHERENTS.

02:38:59.230 --> 02:39:02.433 region:rollup2
COSTS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY

02:39:00.197 --> 02:39:03.601 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND LIVES A YEAR.

02:39:02.433 --> 02:39:05.669 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:39:03.601 --> 02:39:08.105 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THIS TECHNOLOGY IS IS

02:39:05.669 --> 02:39:09.807 region:rollup2
AT THE VERY BEGINNING STAGES OF

02:39:08.105 --> 02:39:11.876 region:rollup2
WHERE IT COULD ONE DAY BE.

02:39:09.807 --> 02:39:13.911 region:rollup2
OVER REGULATING AT THIS POINT

02:39:11.876 --> 02:39:14.345 region:rollup2
MAY STIFLE INNOVATION AND WERE

02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:15.746 region:rollup2
JUST CONCERNED THAT.

02:39:14.345 --> 02:39:17.148 region:rollup2
.

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:17.748 region:rollup2
WE BE SENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES

02:39:17.148 --> 02:39:20.084 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN REPORTS UP THANK YOU

02:39:17.748 --> 02:39:21.652 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:39:20.084 --> 02:39:22.386 region:rollup2
HI GOOD AFTERNOON AT MY NAME'S

02:39:21.652 --> 02:39:23.454 region:rollup2
FIELDING GRIEVE SOME WITH THE

02:39:22.386 --> 02:39:24.922 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

02:39:23.454 --> 02:39:26.090 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ONE ASSOCIATE WITH

02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:27.391 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS I WITH HIM HIS

02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:29.560 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:30.795 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO SHARE THAT WE THINK

02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.630 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE PREMATURE AT THIS

02:39:30.795 --> 02:39:33.898 region:rollup2
TIME TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:35.766 region:rollup2
IN THIS WAY. GIVEN THE

02:39:33.898 --> 02:39:38.669 region:rollup2
OVERLAPPING THAT FEDERAL

02:39:35.766 --> 02:39:39.937 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS FTA AND I HAVE TO

02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:43.174 region:rollup2
SEE CURRENTLY HAVE.

02:39:39.937 --> 02:39:45.409 region:rollup2
FDA REGULATIONS DO AB CONSIDER

02:39:43.174 --> 02:39:47.378 region:rollup2
A HOLISTIC RISK BASED APPROACH

02:39:45.409 --> 02:39:48.479 region:rollup2
TO MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY SO

02:39:47.378 --> 02:39:49.513 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES ALL DATA

02:39:48.479 --> 02:39:52.183 region:rollup2
STEWARDSHIP ISSUES BOTH

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:53.751 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY. AND DATA PRIVACY.

02:39:52.183 --> 02:39:54.852 region:rollup2
AT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

02:39:53.751 --> 02:39:57.855 region:rollup2
IS EXTREMELY BROAD AUTHORITY

02:39:54.852 --> 02:40:00.124 region:rollup2
UNDER SECTION FIVE TO REGULATE.

02:39:57.855 --> 02:40:02.460 region:rollup2
ON DECEPTIVE I OR UNFAIR

02:40:00.124 --> 02:40:04.195 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PRACTICES SO.

02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:05.963 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE THE TECHNOLOGY

02:40:04.195 --> 02:40:07.998 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE INDUSTRY IT'S HELD

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:08.999 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE CONSUMER AND INTO THE

02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:10.835 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

02:40:08.999 --> 02:40:12.736 region:rollup2
AS GIVING FULL CONTROL AND

02:40:10.835 --> 02:40:14.138 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP OF THE DATA TO THE

02:40:12.736 --> 02:40:15.439 region:rollup2
ACTUAL PATIENT INCLUDING WHETHER

02:40:14.138 --> 02:40:16.373 region:rollup2
OR NOT THAT DATE IS GIVEN OVER

02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:18.309 region:rollup2
TO THE DOCTOR.

02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:19.844 region:rollup2
HIM HERSELF.

02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:20.644 region:rollup2
SO IF THAT WERE EVER FOUND OUT

02:40:19.844 --> 02:40:22.046 region:rollup2
TO BE TRUE THEY BEEN VIOLATION

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:23.047 region:rollup2
OF THE ACT THE FEDERAL TRADE

02:40:22.046 --> 02:40:24.982 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COULD CERTAINLY STEP

02:40:23.047 --> 02:40:26.417 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE EXTREMELY BROAD

02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:27.551 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO DO TO DO SO. AND

02:40:26.417 --> 02:40:29.887 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO CURRENTLY HAVE AN MO

02:40:27.551 --> 02:40:32.089 region:rollup2
YOU WITH THE FDA TO TO.

02:40:29.887 --> 02:40:33.357 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE WITH THE FDA ON

02:40:32.089 --> 02:40:34.325 region:rollup2
THAT PLATFORM REGULATIONS SO

02:40:33.357 --> 02:40:37.995 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE JUST EXPRESSES

02:40:34.325 --> 02:40:40.531 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:41.165 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF ANY KIND.

02:40:40.531 --> 02:40:42.800 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:40:41.165 --> 02:40:43.968 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE NOW. MR CHOW DO YOU

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.469 region:rollup2
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO.

02:40:43.968 --> 02:40:46.937 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:49.640 region:rollup2
IT DOES SEEM LIKE WE HAVE.

02:40:46.937 --> 02:40:51.275 region:rollup2
QUITE A LOT OF THAT REGULATORS

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.543 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THERE'S THE FDA

02:40:51.275 --> 02:40:53.677 region:rollup2
APPROVAL PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE SO

02:40:52.543 --> 02:40:55.312 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THIS GONNA AT.

02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:58.082 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK JUST OF THIS

02:40:55.312 --> 02:40:59.950 region:rollup2
BILL IS TO BASICALLY ARM.

02:40:58.082 --> 02:41:01.886 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THE THE INFORMATION

02:40:59.950 --> 02:41:03.954 region:rollup2
THAT WE COLLECT ARE BY THESE

02:41:01.886 --> 02:41:05.856 region:rollup2
DIGITAL PILLS IS PROTECTED

02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:07.024 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE UNDERLYING A

02:41:05.856 --> 02:41:09.093 region:rollup2
RATIONALE FOR THE BILL. NOW

02:41:07.024 --> 02:41:10.928 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY UNDER YOU THEIR HIP OR

02:41:09.093 --> 02:41:11.829 region:rollup2
CMI A TO CALIFORNIA VERSION OF

02:41:10.928 --> 02:41:14.365 region:rollup2
IT BUT. ESSENTIALLY PROTECTS

02:41:11.829 --> 02:41:15.533 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT'S GENERATED BY

02:41:14.365 --> 02:41:17.568 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.

02:41:15.533 --> 02:41:19.103 region:rollup2
AND DOW IF IT IF IT IS STAND

02:41:17.568 --> 02:41:20.738 region:rollup2
IT'S A PROTECTIVE BUT ARE NOW

02:41:19.103 --> 02:41:23.674 region:rollup2
ALSO IF THE INFORMATION IS

02:41:20.738 --> 02:41:25.342 region:rollup2
RECEIVED BY THE MEDICAL PROVIDER

02:41:23.674 --> 02:41:27.478 region:rollup2
ALL BEEN IT'S ALSO PROTECTED YET

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:28.746 region:rollup2
UNDER DISSERVICE CONSENSUS. OP

02:41:27.478 --> 02:41:31.482 region:rollup2
THE JET THE INFORMATION IS

02:41:28.746 --> 02:41:34.985 region:rollup2
GENERATED APPLIED TO DEVISE A

02:41:31.482 --> 02:41:36.887 region:rollup2
WHICH BEFORE IT GETS UP RECEIVED

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:37.655 region:rollup2
BY THE YOU KNOW THAT THE.

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:39.323 region:rollup2
POSITION FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT

02:41:37.655 --> 02:41:40.591 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT PROTECTED SO WHICH IS

02:41:39.323 --> 02:41:42.293 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CLOSE OUT LOW GAP

02:41:40.591 --> 02:41:43.694 region:rollup2
THERE SO.

02:41:42.293 --> 02:41:45.796 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF THEM YOU KNOW IT OF

02:41:43.694 --> 02:41:47.231 region:rollup2
IT IF DOT INFORMATION IS ALREADY

02:41:45.796 --> 02:41:48.732 region:rollup2
GENERATED BY A PHYSICIAN WAS

02:41:47.231 --> 02:41:49.867 region:rollup2
ALWAYS PROTECTED IF IT'S

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:51.235 region:rollup2
RECEIVED BY VISITING IT'S A

02:41:49.867 --> 02:41:53.971 region:rollup2
PROTECTED BUT IT'S NOT LITTLE

02:41:51.235 --> 02:41:56.040 region:rollup2
KIND OF A GAP IN BETWEEN. THAT

02:41:53.971 --> 02:41:57.875 region:rollup2
WE TRYING TO THE PLUG SO THAT'S

02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:59.310 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT TO

02:41:57.875 --> 02:42:00.811 region:rollup2
TO THESE DEVICES THAT WOULD

02:41:59.310 --> 02:42:02.646 region:rollup2
GENERATE ARE YOU KNOW.

02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:03.881 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE INFORMATION PLEASE

02:42:02.646 --> 02:42:05.516 region:rollup2
FOR DOUBLE HEART RATE OR

02:42:03.881 --> 02:42:08.185 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. ON

02:42:05.516 --> 02:42:10.321 region:rollup2
THEN BEFORE IT REACHES THAT THE.

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:13.524 region:rollup2
THE POSITIONS OF OFFICE THEN DOT

02:42:10.321 --> 02:42:14.358 region:rollup2
WILL YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE

02:42:13.524 --> 02:42:16.260 region:rollup2
DOUBT THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

02:42:14.358 --> 02:42:16.927 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO PROTECT.

02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:18.429 region:rollup2
TWO SO THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:20.297 region:rollup2
BILL SO IT'S A VERY TINY LITTLE

02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:22.499 region:rollup2
THING ARE SO THE IN FACT.

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:23.434 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY HOUSE A BILL THAT I

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:24.902 region:rollup2
IN FACT.

02:42:23.434 --> 02:42:26.937 region:rollup2
AUTHORED BY A MISTER CALDERON

02:42:24.902 --> 02:42:27.871 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR THAT WOULD PROTECT

02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:29.173 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME IT'S

02:42:27.871 --> 02:42:31.842 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROTECTION TO.

02:42:29.173 --> 02:42:33.244 region:rollup2
THE DEVICES THAT WOULD GENERATE

02:42:31.842 --> 02:42:34.345 region:rollup2
I MEAN ARE YOU THIS IS SOFTWARE

02:42:33.244 --> 02:42:38.048 region:rollup2
AND HARDWARE.

02:42:34.345 --> 02:42:39.283 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE YOU KNOW.

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:40.884 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFERENT BILL A BILL

02:42:39.283 --> 02:42:42.553 region:rollup2
NUMBER FIVE YET EXACTLY WOULDN'T

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:43.153 region:rollup2
BILL NUMBER THAT WAS BROUGH YOU

02:42:42.553 --> 02:42:43.821 region:rollup2
KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE

02:42:43.153 --> 02:42:45.422 region:rollup2
GAP THERE.

02:42:43.821 --> 02:42:47.024 region:rollup2
SO I HOPE THAT CLARIFIES.

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:48.959 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT THAT'S A FEDERAL LINE

02:42:47.024 --> 02:42:50.194 region:rollup2
AND STATE LAW.

02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:51.128 region:rollup2
WE DON'T STUFF I DON'T WANT TO

02:42:50.194 --> 02:42:53.063 region:rollup2
STIFLE IN WE INNOVATION YOU KNOW

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:54.965 region:rollup2
FOR SURE.

02:42:53.063 --> 02:42:58.802 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

02:42:54.965 --> 02:42:59.770 region:rollup2
MISTER OBERNOLTE.

02:42:58.802 --> 02:43:01.238 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT SEEMING LIKE A BOOK

02:42:59.770 --> 02:43:03.007 region:rollup2
BROKEN RECORD I THINK IT'S

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:04.975 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE SPECIFIC.

02:43:03.007 --> 02:43:06.276 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY ONE THE CONSEQUENCES

02:43:04.975 --> 02:43:07.511 region:rollup2
OF VIOLATION OF THE LAW ARE

02:43:06.276 --> 02:43:08.846 region:rollup2
SEVERE AS THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:11.248 region:rollup2
IT CREATES NEW CRIMINAL

02:43:08.846 --> 02:43:12.916 region:rollup2
LIABILITY. SO I THERE'S A TERM

02:43:11.248 --> 02:43:14.251 region:rollup2
IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT.

02:43:12.916 --> 02:43:15.552 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REQUIRED A REASONABLE

02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:17.521 region:rollup2
SECURITY FEATURES APPROPRIATE TO

02:43:15.552 --> 02:43:19.123 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM.

02:43:17.521 --> 02:43:21.325 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A

02:43:19.123 --> 02:43:22.760 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB DEFINING EXACTLY WHAT

02:43:21.325 --> 02:43:24.128 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES ARE

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:25.729 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I JUST CAN ENVISION A

02:43:24.128 --> 02:43:27.431 region:rollup2
ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS ARGUING

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:28.299 region:rollup2
ABOUT. WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT

02:43:27.431 --> 02:43:30.634 region:rollup2
WHAT WE MET WHEN WE SET

02:43:28.299 --> 02:43:31.402 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SO I HAD TO TO

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:33.570 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION NOT GOT A QUESTION

02:43:31.402 --> 02:43:35.105 region:rollup2
FOR YOU IS. I NOTICED THAT YOU

02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:36.006 region:rollup2
ALSO SAID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:37.875 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:43:36.006 --> 02:43:39.276 region:rollup2
THE IDENTIFICATION SITE THE.

02:43:37.875 --> 02:43:41.512 region:rollup2
DATA IS I DIDN'T AS

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:43.447 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND

02:43:41.512 --> 02:43:44.481 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING WHY. YOU PUT THAT

02:43:43.447 --> 02:43:45.949 region:rollup2
IN THERE BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:47.851 region:rollup2
LIKE ONLY THE INDIVIDUALLY

02:43:45.949 --> 02:43:48.852 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS THE

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:51.422 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WE WOULD HAVE FOR

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:52.323 region:rollup2
PRIVACY CONCERNS ABOUT.

02:43:51.422 --> 02:43:54.191 region:rollup2
PA I HAVE LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE

02:43:52.323 --> 02:43:56.060 region:rollup2
A BIT MORE CLOSELY BUT I I THINK

02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:58.328 region:rollup2
THE INTENT IS TO PROTECT. OUR

02:43:56.060 --> 02:44:01.765 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:43:58.328 --> 02:44:02.666 region:rollup2
ANYBODY TO OUR LINK BACK TO THE

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:04.635 region:rollup2
THE. THE.

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:05.602 region:rollup2
GENERATOR OF THAT OF THAT

02:44:04.635 --> 02:44:06.804 region:rollup2
PERSON.

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:08.105 region:rollup2
BEAT OUT A PRINT PATIENT OR THE

02:44:06.804 --> 02:44:08.605 region:rollup2
HUESO TO ANY INFORMATION THAT

02:44:08.105 --> 02:44:10.808 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW SOMEBODY TO

02:44:08.605 --> 02:44:11.875 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY.

02:44:10.808 --> 02:44:13.644 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW.

02:44:11.875 --> 02:44:16.046 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON I THINK WE WANT

02:44:13.644 --> 02:44:17.748 region:rollup2
PROTECT. I WOULD AGREE DOWN BUT

02:44:16.046 --> 02:44:19.416 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T CLASSIFY ANYTHING

02:44:17.748 --> 02:44:21.452 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU COULD LINK BACK AS
