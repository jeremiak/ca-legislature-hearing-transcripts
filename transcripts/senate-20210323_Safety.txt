B. TWO SIX TWO. SENATOR HERTZBERG WHEN YOU'RE READY SENATOR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I STAND BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY 2% THIS MEASURE ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY JOINT AUTHORS YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER SKINNER AND TOGETHER WITH. MR BONTA FOR THE OTHER HOUSE- IT'S BEEN PART OF THIS PROCESS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. TOMORROW WE'LL GET ASIAN AND THIS GOVERNMENT. IS TO ENSURE A FAIR PROCESS THAT PEOPLE ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. THAT VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED. AND TO CONTINUE TO LEARN AND TO GROW AND GET BETTER AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I EMBARKED UPON THIS SAID AFTER WORKING A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT CAME OUT OF THE FERGUSON REPORT AND THE INJUSTICES IN FERGUSON. AND IT HAD TO DO WITH THE BAIL SYSTEM. IN THE BILL SYSTEM IS A PLACE WHERE FOLKS ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME BUT HAVE THERE HAS NOT BEEN THE- A JURY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE GUILTY OR INNOCENT. AND SO WE AS A SOCIETY TRY TO MEASURE AND BALANCE OUT THE ISSUE OF. TAKE IN TREATING PEOPLE FAIRLY TO MAKE SURE THEY CHECK SHOW UP TO COURT. IN THE MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T COMMIT FURTHER CRIMES IF IT'S A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE OR SOME PARTICULAR AREA AND WE HAVE BEEN. DEALING WITH THIS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE OF BAIL. SO IN BARKING ON THIS JOURNEY. OUR FOCUS WAS REALLY WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW UNJUST AND UNFAIR AND INEFFECTIVE THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM HAS BEEN TURNS PEOPLE'S LIVES UPSIDE DOWN DOESN'T MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER DOESN'T RETURN PEOPLE TO COURT QUICKER HI WE HAVE THE DATE ON THAT WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT. STAGGERING FACES WERE PEOPLE ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME INTO THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM AVERAGE BAILING CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOUR SHOULD BE TO A BAIL AGENT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU GOTTA PUT FIVE GRAND YOU DON'T GET IT BACK. HUGELY ON JUST ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM UNFAIR AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY NOT EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING. JUSTICE AND SAFETY FOR. OUR COMMUNITIES THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM DOESN'T EVEN RESULT AS I SAY FROM A Q. SHOWING UP A RECORD RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA INDICATES AND CONCLUDED THAT SIX POINT SIX OF CALIFORNIA DEFENDANTS HAVE MULTIPLE FAILURES TO APPEAR WELL THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. IS TWO POINT NINE MEETING OF THE BAIL SYSTEM AS EXISTING DOESN'T EVEN SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT SEEKS TO SOLVE IT HAS EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES SO IN LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS AND EXAMINING THIS ON A NATIONAL LEVEL WE WORKED YOU KNOW MAKE IT SHORT ON THIS PART WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE WHO PUT TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE MEASURE SOME OF WHOM FOLKS HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE WORD AUTHORS AND JOINT AUTHORS AND CO AUTHORS OF. AND WE WAITED FOR THE SUPREME COURT. TO ACT AND THEY BASICALLY TO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE SUGGESTED A SYSTEM BASED OUT OF PRE TRIAL DETENTION BASED UPON A SERRANO CASE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT THAT SAYS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A PRE TRIAL DETENTION SYSTEM YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE BAIL. SO THE PROPOSAL ULTIMATELY IN SB TEN WHICH THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AS ALL GET TO WAS REPLACING THE WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH THE BAIL SYSTEM WHICH WORKS SUPPORTING IN THIS MEASURE WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF ALGORITHMS AND A HUGE BUREAUCRATIC INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH FORM. THE FOUNDATION OF THE OPPOSITION. SO THAT MAKES WAS PASSED. AND THE ARGUMENTS JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR AS TO WHY- THAT WERE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVEN COMPANIES THAT PUT UP THE MILLION DOLLARS TO PUSH TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR BAIL INDUSTRY BUSINESS THE SHIRT ACCOMPANIES. THE ARGUMENTS WARNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM IS FAIR AND JUST OR EFFECTIVE THE ARGUMENTS WERE ABOUT ALGORITHMS THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE THAT THESE COMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS I'M READING FROM THE OFFICIAL VOTER GUIDE. HOW THE GOODS TO MAKE IMPORTANT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS COMPUTER MODELS MAY BE GOOD FOR RECOMMENDING SONGS AND MOVIES BUT USING THESE PROFILING MESSAGE TO DECIDE WHO GETS RELEASED FROM JAIL AND WHO GETS A LOAN HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALICE HUFFMAN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA'S CONFERENCE OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP FATHERS CREATE TALKED ABOUT BUREAUCRACY. NOBODY NOBODY IN TRYING TO DEFEAT REFORM OF THE BILL SYSTEM SAID THAT THE BILL SYSTEM WORK. NOBODY SAID THAT IT WAS JUST. THEY ALL JUST SAID. ALGORITHMS BUREAUCRACY MORE SPENDING TAXES THOSE ARE THE ARGUMENTS AND SO THE ISSUE THAT INFORMS THE FIRE BOB MARLEY COSTS THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR THIS ISSUE IS JUSTICE JUSTICE MEASURED BY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT JUSTICE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS BILL WITH SENATOR SKINNER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA DOES NOT RELY ON THE PROCHE OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN BEFORE IT BASICALLY REPLACES IT DOESN'T REPLACE WHICH WAS DONE AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE WORKING GROUP BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE. BUT IT WORKS ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION A BAIL AND MAKES IT BETTER FAIRER MORE JUST. SO EACH THE FIRST POINT IS THAT THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY IN LARGE MEASURE ACTION A COMPLETELY IN LARGE MEASURE BASED UPON. THE D. ZERO BAIL ORDER BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEANING THAT THE JUDGES SCRUB THIS REPORTS THE GALLERY AND% THE LIKE AND WE'RE BASICALLY CODIFYING THAT ZERO BAIL. MEASURE THAT WAS VETTED BY THE COURTS DOES FOUR THINGS FIRST. IT LEVELS THE PRE TRIAL PLAYING FIELD BY SETTING BAIL AT ZERO DOLLARS. FOR MOST MISDEMEANORS AND LOW LEVEL FELONIES EXACTLY HOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT AN EMERGENCY ORDER OF APRIL TWENTY TWENTY SECOND. IT ENSURES THAT THE ACCUSED DID NOT ASSUME ANY COSTS OF COURT IMPOSED PRETRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS ANOTHER ISSUE COMPLETELY UNFAIR ABOUT THE RICH VERSUS THE POOR. IF YOU'RE POOR YOU'RE STUCK IN JAIL YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS ONE OF THE CORE JUSTICE ELEMENTS HERE THREE. REQUIRES BILL COMPANIES TO REFORM THE PREMIUMS THEY RECEIVE FROM PEOPLE ARRESTED BUT ARE CHARGED. WITH THEIR CASES DISMISSED IT AVOIDS THIS UNBELIEVABLE PREDATORY LENDING COULD YOU IMAGINE. IF YOU WANT HAD A LOAN AGAINST YOUR HOUSE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU TO PAY A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FREE HOPE SORRY THE LOAN NEVER WENT THROUGH BUT WE GET TO KEEP THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. I GIVE YOU A HUNDRED EXAMPLES OF JUST HOW. LEE UNFAIR THAT IS AND FOURTH IT ENSURES THAT THE ACCUSED TO NOT REMAIN IN CUSTODY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY BAIL. ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS JUST HEARD IN JANUARY VERY IMPORTANT CASE CALLED IN RE HUMPHRIES. IT DEALS WITH THE ABILITY OF A POP UP- SOMEONE WHO'S ACCUSED ABILITY TO PAY A DALE. THAT CASE I'M TOLD WE SPOKE WITH A LAWYER YESTERDAY WHO ARGUED THE CASE THAT DECISION MAY COME DOWN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS SO RATHER THAN IN THE LANGUAGE THIS MEASURE MAKE AN ASSUMPTION WE SIMPLY REFERENCE THE HUMPHRIES CASE AS TO. GUIDED BY THAT. SECOND FROM THE APRIL TO THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE ZERO BILL ORDER WAS IN PLACE THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL OF THE DATA PP I SEE WE'VE GOT SOME OPTIONS SOME LETTERS WERE PEOPLE TELL ONE STORY OR ANOTHER STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO GOT OUT OF JAIL AND CAUSED ANOTHER CRIME OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT THE EALITY IS THAT PROPERTY CRIMES HAVE DECREASED DURING THAT TIME FRAME SECOND VIOLENT CRIMES HAVE REMAINED CONSISTENT THERE'S NO FUN FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THIS POLICY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS PEOPLE ARE TREATED WITH JUSTICE AND DIGNITY THAT GO OVER THEIR FAMILIES. THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THEY CAN HIRE A LAWYER THEY CAN KEEP THEIR JOB THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE OTHER CONSEQUENCES THEIR LIVES ARE NOT COPPING A PLEA YOUR CASE TO GET A JAIL BECAUSE OUR LIFE IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. SO IT IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY. THAT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS HOW EFFECTIVE THE ZERO BALANCE AND IN FACT. THIRTY ONE COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STILLHAVE THE ZERO BILL SYSTEM. AND IT STILL WORKS YOU'RE GONNA HEAR EXAMPLES I'M SURE. OF SOMEBODY GO TO JAIL THERE WAS SOME EXAMPLES AND ONE OF THE LETTER OF THIS PERSON HERE AND THAT PERSON THERE. ALWAYS IS THE CASE. WHAT DO WE MAKE PUBLIC POLICY BASED UPON THE ISOLATED EXAMPLE IN ONE INSTANCE TO ANOTHER BASED UPON THE OPERATION ORDER WE LOOK AT THE LARGE BODY OF DATA. IN TERMS OF WHAT IMPACT THERE IS TO SOCIETY. WHAT WE KNOW. IS THAT. IN TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY THIS IS SO CRAZY AND SO SIMPLE. IF YOU TAX TO SOMEBODY. PEOPLE ARE NOT SHOWING UP FOR COURTBECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THE BAHAMAS ARE GOING TO SOME PLACE. THAT DOESN'T HAVE EXTRADITION. THEY'RE BUSY. THIRD GOT WORK THEIR KIDS GOT SICK. THEY LOST THEIR PAPERWORK WHO KNOWS. SHOULD THE EIGHTY BE SUBJECT TO SUCH IMPOSITIONS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AT THEIR LIBERTY BECAUSE OF THAT. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. A MODEL WHICH INCLUDES TEXTING. 95% OF PRETRIAL APPEARANCES RATES FOR DEFENDANTS. AND THE- THREE THIRTY POINT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS SAVE MONEY GETS APPEARANCES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BETWEEN APRIL. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DEFENDANTS RELEASED ON OWN RECOGNIZANCE OR SUPERVISOR CARDS SINCE MEANING THAT THEY'RE GETTING THESE TEXTS OR WHATEVER. AVOID REARREST FOR NO OFFENSE THE SERVICE MEMBERS. 99% OF THE TIME THERE IS NO BETTER DATA TREATING WITH PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND FAIRNESS ON THE ONE HAND AND ACHIEVING THE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN GOVERNMENT THIRTY ONE JURISDICTIONS HAVE KEPT THE SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT'S WORKING. SO. I AM HERE TODAY TO CONTINUE FIGHT THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR MANY YEARS. I WILL NOT GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS FAIR AND WHAT WORKS WHAT WORKS WHAT IMPACTS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO BAIL AND BAIL. IS A POOR PEOPLE STAY IN JAIL UNDER THE BAIL SYSTEM. UNDER THE BILL SYSTEM IF YOU GOT THE MONEY WHETHER YOU'RE THROUGH WITH ALL RISK OR NOT YOU YOU'RE OUT. DO WE WANT A SYSTEM BASED UPON THE- WE WANT OUR SYSTEM TO DETERMINE STUDENT GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY WHICH PEOPLE CAN HIRE BETTER LAWYERS. THEY CAN LIVE IN BETTER COMMUNITIES BREATHE BETTER AIR FLY IN PRIVATE JETS NO COST. FAIR NUMBER HAS A RIGHT TO DO THAT. BUT WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO DO SAID THEIR GOVERNMENT MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAKES A DECISION. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE FREE OR NOT WHAT GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WITH THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO IN EVERY INSTANCE IS TO MAKE SURE. ALL WHICH- EVERY INSTANCE POSSIBLE PEOPLE'S LIBERTY IS NOT DETAINED FOR IRRATIONAL AND WRONG REASONS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THIS MEASURE WE HAVE CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE. CENTER SKINNER NINE. BUT WE'VE DONE IT. IN A WAY. THAT DOES NOT LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE OUTLINED. IN THE PREVIOUS MEASURE THAT. WE DEALT WITH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WELL WE'RE WORKING WITHIN EXISTING. AND WERE BEING INFORMED BY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT'S HOPEFULLY WILL DO IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. LAST YEAR I BOUGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG REPRESENTATION NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT I SEE YOU HAVE A PRINCIPAL WITNESS BY THE NAME OF ESTEBAN UNIONS ARE CORRECT YES. I CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING SIR I APOLOGIZE I FAILED TO MENTION THIS. IN THE PASSION OF MY MOMENT- BUT THE ADDITIONAL COALITION PARTNERS ON THIS MEMBERS.

MISS NOONAN WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWO SIX TWO. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS AT FUNDING AS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING FOR THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS A R. C. A. R. HE WORKS TO END MASS INCARCERATION IN CALIFORNIA. TO ENSURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE HEALTHY AND WHOLE EMPOWERS FORMERLY AND CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO THRIVE BY PROVIDING A SUPPORT NETWORK COMPREHENSIVE REENTRY SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVOCATE A POLICY CHANGE. THERE ARE GRASSROOTS POLICY ADVOCACY WE ARE DEDICATED TO TRANSFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL PEOPLE. HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO REFORM CALIFORNIA'S PRETRIAL SYSTEM- OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS BECAUSE WE HAVE WE TRULY BELIEVE IN EQUITY FAIRNESS ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT ALSO AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE I WANT TO GROUND US IN A STORY OF AN A. R. C. MEMBER WHO SADLY IS UNABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY. RIGHT BEFORE KOBE GRAND RAPIDS IN CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED BUT YOU'RE A BELL SCHEDULE FOR PEOPLE BEING CHARGED WITH LOWER LEVEL OFFENSES. AND A R. C. MEMBER HAVE BEEN. INTERNALLY STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH VANDALISM. IT BELL AS WELL BEYOND WHAT YOU COULD AFFORD A TRUTH BE TOLD THIS YOUNG MAN WAS IN DIRE NEED OF HELP AND SUPPORT OF SERVICES NOT COUNTY JAIL. A WEEK LATER HE WAS MURDERED IN COUNTY JAIL. WHAT WHAT HE REALLY NEEDED AGAIN WITH SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT BACKED OUT OF THERE SHE- I OFTENTIMES. THESE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES OR CRIMES OF DESPERATION AND OUTCRY IF YOU WILL. NOT ONE THAT SIGNALS THE FUTURE LIFE OF CRIME BUT ONE THAT SIGNALS THEIR BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET- COUNTY JAIL COULD NOT ONLY BE TRAUMATIZING WITHIN ITSELF. BUT IT CAN EXACERBATE ALREADY UNDERLYING TRAUMAS IN CONDITIONS IT'S NOT A PLACE OF HEALING REHABILITATION OR MATURATION. COUNTY JAIL IS A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE QUICKLY STRIPPED OF YOUR DIGNITY AND CONFIDENCE IT'S A NATURAL DEPRESSION REAL BUT DESPAIR AND FEAR. WHAT LIES AHEAD HERE YOUR EMPLOYER WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHOW UP FOR WORK. YOUR CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BAIL OUT HERE THAT YOU MAY BE FORCED INTO A PLEA BARGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM HAS STOCK STOCK YEAH BOB AGAINST YOU OR WORSE.

THIS IS THE FINAL CALL FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE. Q. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE SENATORS CAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU- SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING US THIS BILL OF COURSE I AM PART OF THE EFFORT TO BRING THIS BILL AS A PRINCIPAL AUTHOR- NINE AUTHOR JOINT AUTHORS CORRECT- YOU ADDRESSED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THE ISSUE AROUND- ON THIS NOTION OF IT THERE SOME OF OUR OPPOSITION SPOKE ABOUT IT LIKE THAT THE YOU KNOW THIS. TO REDESIGN THIS WOULD BE ON DOING THIS NOTION OF IT AS AN INSURANCE POLICY SO I WILL LET YOU AN ADDRESS THAT IN JUST A MOMENT BUT I WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS BEFORE YOU DO- WE HAVE A BASIC FUNDAMENTAL FACT THAT. BECAUSE OF OUR THE WAY OUR CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED. PEOPLE WITH MONEY GET OUT OF JAIL AND PEOPLE WITHOUT DUE NORTH. AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. AND THAT WEALTH TEST MEANS THAT SOME PEOPLE AND AGAIN EVEN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BASED ON INNOCENCE UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A- DOLLARS AMOUNT THEN THAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU SIT IN JAIL PRIOR TO A TRIAL. IS IN EFFECT LIKE A GUILTY SENTENCE BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF SITTING IN JAIL MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK THUS YOU MAY EVEN LOSE YOUR JOB AS A RESULT MOST LIKELY YES. THE END YOU ARE ALSO NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES WHICH PUTS YOUR FAMILY IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION OR IF YOU'RE A- SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. IT CAN PUT YOU IN ARREARS INTO AND GET YOU INTO DEBT. IT PUT YOU TAKES YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY. AND IT CAN CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET BEHIND ON CAR PAYMENT OR A RENT PAYMENT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO YOUR VEHICLE YOU'RE AT WHERE YOU LIVE. NOW WHAT KIND OF JUSTICE IS THAT IT IS NOT JUSTICE IN TERMS OF THE MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TRYING TO BE- THE OTHER THING WE HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I'D SAY MUCH MORE SO. IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS. LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY THROUGH A RACIAL LENS AS TO HOW TO CHESTER CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES BUT- ALL KINDS OF POLICIES HOUSING POLICIES YOU NAME IMPACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND IF WE TAKE JUST THE BLACK COMMUNITY SO JUST BLACK CALIFORNIANS. AND WE LOOKED AT. HOW THE SYSTEM IMPACTS. BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE DETAINED DETAINED AT A RATE FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT CALIFORNIANS BLACK DEFENDANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE RELEASED ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE THAN WHITE DEFENDANTS AND BLACK DEFENDANTS AGES EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY NINE RECEIVE HIGHER BAIL AMOUNTS THAN ANY OTHER GROUP AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT. AND YOU ALSO LOOK AT WEALTH COMPARISONS OF BLACK AMERICANS TO WHITE AMERICANS WERE CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY. BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BLACK CALIFORNIANS HAVE FAR LESS WEALTH COMPARATIVELY SO THEN THEY ARE PUT FURTHER IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD BAIL NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY USE A HOME. IN ORDER TO PUT UP THE SECURITY FOR BILL BUT WE SAW WITH IN GENERAL THERE'S LESS HOMEOWNERSHIP BY BLACK CALIFORNIANS IN WITH THE LAST GREAT RECESSION IT DROPPED EVEN FURTHER. AND HOPEFULLY THIS PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION WILL NOT CAUSE A FURTHER DROP IN BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT ONCE ONE'S ABILITY TO RETAIN THEIR HOME SHOULD NOT. P. BUT THREATENED BY A UNFAIR MONEY BAIL SYSTEM SO I AM VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COALITION THAT AND A- JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL BUT SENATOR ERTZBERG IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THIS INSURANCE NOTION. YEAH YOU KNOW THAT'S A FUNNY ARGUMENT WITH A BILL LAST YEAR ON THAT ISSUE BUT- CALIFORNIA WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL DOESN'T MATTER. GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THERE'S SOME BEHAVIOR THAT'S UNFAIR YOU CAN'T CHARGE SOMEBODY 2000% INTEREST TODAY. ITS USERS WE GO MAKE THOSE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'VE GOT THIS INDUSTRY THIS IS WILSHIRE INDUSTRY AND COMES UP WITH SOME LEGAL DEFINITION. OF THIS A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASE RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY AREA IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS SENATOR THAT LOOKS AT THE ISSUE OF PRICE FIXING THIS IS A BIG. THAT SAYS WELL. IT'S 10% WELL GREAT IF YOU GO BY CAR YOU GO BUY SOMETHING EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME PRICE THAT'S PRICE FIXING I THINK THEY'RE GOING BIG TROUBLE I THINK YOU LOSE BIG. I THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY HAVE ON THE CLOCK IS TICKING AWAY BECAUSE THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS BASED UPON. UNFAIRNESS TO THE PUBLIC. AT EVERY LEVEL AND SO THE ISSUE ABOUT BEING AN INSURANCE POLICY AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ARGUE. ARE JUST LEGAL FICTIONS THE REALITY IS GOVERNMENT ALL THE TIME ENGAGED IN CONSUMER PROTECTION. ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN CHARGE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE WHAT TYPE OF DISCLOSURES HAVE TO BE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND WE ALL SUPPORT THOSE ALMOST A UNANIMOUS BASIS. TO THOSE ARGUMENTS FAIL AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IN TROUBLE ON THE ISSUE PRICE FIXING. AND THE DAY IS COMING SOON. SOONER OTOBO. WHERE DO WE GO SENATE HERTZBERG. ONE BEGIN BY THANKING THE TURF YOUR PARTY TO SPEAK AND THAT WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR TIRELESS EFFORTS FOR MONEY UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING A VERY LONG TIME IN AN EFFORT TO FIND EIGHTY A FAIR AND BALANCED SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE AND I AM AN ABSOLUTE CREAM IN WITH YOU IN THE FACT THAT. THERE IS DEFINITELY- A PROBLEM WITH WITH OUR SYSTEM IT THERE REALLY IS FUNDAMENTALLY THERE IS A PROBLEM AND I COMPLETELY ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS- MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY- WE DO HAVE A CULTURE THAT UNFORTUNATELY. IS NOT. VERY VERY CONDUCIVE TO THE NOTION OF INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY AND THAT GOES BOTH ON IN A SOCIAL MEDIA IT GOES TO OUR NEWS RESOURCES YOU JUST CULTURALLY WHERE WE- FIND OURSELVES IN IS VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS- WHICH I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS AND THAT I WANTED TO. TO MENTION ON HERE AND- LET ME BEGIN BY STATING THAT- I DO IN THE STATE AND WANT TO NOTE THAT- CALIFORNIA VOTERS REJECTED. THE NO BAIL- SYSTEM. AT WITH RISK ASSESSMENTS IMPOSED ON BY S. B. TEN WITH A FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT- BUT THE MAJORITY VOTE IN IN NOVEMBER. THIRD TWENTY TWENTY. AND I DO IN ITS CURIOUS BECAUSE I WAS JUST SENT A FAX FROM MY DISTRICT IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY- REJECTED THAT FILLED AS WELL- SO THE PROBLEM IT WAS REJECTED- FEDERAL IT WAS 62% IS WHAT I THINK I SAW QUITE A BIT SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE- WITH THE ISSUES AND ONE OF ON. SOME OF THESE LEADERS FIND MY NOTES HERE- THE EXCLUSIONS ARE VERY SPECIFIC IT BADLY BUT A LOT OF A TROUBLING OFFENSES INCLUDING THE FACT THAT- IT EXCLUDES I BELIEVE- CHILD ABUSE AND ELDER ABUSE JUST TO NAME A COUPLE- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF THEM THAT I THAT I FOUND THAT THEY WERE BEING- EXCLUDED ON HERE AND I WANTED TO I UNDERSTAND YOUR- YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. ISSUE OF HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR HOW DO YOU COME INTO AGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO THIS BILL- LATE SUCH AS LABOR RELATED. TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHILD ABUSE HATE CRIMES AND WEAPON OFFENCES- THAT FALL INTO IT. TELL IT BOTH OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE ABOUT WHAT WAS ON THE BALLOT BUT THIS MEASURE S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO IS NOT S. B. TEN PERIOD AND OF ISSUE. RAISE THE ISSUE THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT. WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT THE GUT VOTERS ATTENTION IF YOU SAW THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON TELEVISION THE LIKE ALL HAD TO DO WITH THE ISSUE O AN ALGORITHM. SO WHAT DIDN'T GO TO THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH DEAL WITH IN THIS MEASURE WHICH IS JUSTICE AND CORRECTING THE SYSTEM THAT I APPRECIATE YOU NOTICE. YOU MENTIONED IS UNFAIR IT GOES TO WHAT THE APPROACH WAS SO IT CLEARLY IS NOT THIS IS JUST A GOOD FAITH. EFFORT TO FIX THIS UNBELIEVABLY EXTRAORDINARY PROBLEM AND NOT TO OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN ANY RESPECT TO. WITH RESPECT TO THE ADDITION OF THE IT D. EXCLUSIONS FIRST OF ALL IT WAS MENTIONED BY. THE WITNESS FROM CRIME VICTIMS UNITED THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS EXCLUDED NOT THE CASE IT IS. INCLUDED NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO- REGARD THE CHEAP JUDGE YOU. IF TO- ON IN RE WEB WE WAS A BY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CASE HELD THE TRIAL COURTS DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE REASONABLE CONDITIONS. RELATING TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND PERSONS RELEASED ON BAIL. THAT SOMETIMES RELEASING ON ZERO BILL COULD BE SUBJECT TO REASONABLE RELEASE CONDITIONS. BUT UNDER THIS MEASURE THEY WOULD NOT THE DEFENDANT WOULD NOT INCUR COSTS FOR SUCH CONDITIONS SO THE REALITY IS CERTAINLY JUDGE COULD MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS THAT HAS BEEN NOT LOST UNDER THE- CONSTITUTION THAT THERE'S BEEN ARGUED IT'S JUST BEEN MISREPRESENTED. AND THERE IS FLEXIBILITY IN THAT SO WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. OF WHAT COUNTRIES BAIL. WE'RE ASKING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO COME UP WITH THE BAIL SCHEDULE WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DOES BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT OUR OPINION HERE IS. THAT'S GOING TO CONTROL THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS TO PAY TO GET OUT OR NOT. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. RIGHT AND WE ARE TRYING TO WHO. WERE RELYING ON WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID THEY GAVE US A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT. AND HAS A RECORD FROM APRIL TO SEPTEMBER. AND THIRTY ONE COUNTIES HAVE CONTINUED THIS SO THIS IS NOT JUST INVENTING SOMETHING AT A PIE IN THE SKY. BUT WHATEVER SO VERY THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATIVE ENDEAVOR. GROUNDED IN VERY SMART PEOPLE AND GROUNDED IN WAITING FOR THE SUPREME COURT'S ACTION WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE. I THINK IT HELPS IF I COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION. THOSE QUESTIONS IT DOES AND I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE COURT. PROCEEDS AND I'D BE LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THERE'S A LOT OF A CERTAIN SICK YEAH I VERY VERY MUCH. AND THEN THERE WAS THE IT IS WITH THE- IN THE IN THIS IS A THAT SAYS THAT. EACH WE PAY OFFENDERS AS THE SAME AS FIRST TIME OF. IS THAT CORRECT. IT'S A- PUSH AND ANSWER- SO WITHIN THIS BILL- THERE'S AN THERE'S- A- BUT THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR A GIFT TO MOTIONS THINK IF YOU'RE S. IS THE IF IS A CAME A MISDEMEANOR SAME RULES APPLY THAT MEANS THE JUDGE STILL HAS UNDER IN RE WEB IF THERE SOME CIRCLE THAT THEY WANT ALL A COULD. BUT THE IDEA IS I MEAN WHAT'S THE FUNDING LOOK THE PEOPLE HERE. HAVE HUGELY BROKEN HEARTS KERR THINGS HAVE TO THE LIVES AND I HAVE EXT. COMPASSION FOR THEM AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CHALLENGING DEALING WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM IT'S JUST THE FOLKS AT THE ENTER RECIDIVISM COALITION WILL TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN IN JAIL FOR A DAY AND WAS MURDERED BECAUSE THEY WERE STUCK IN JAIL AND GOT BEAT UP IN THAT MURDER THERE'S THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUST AND NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING BUT JUST BE IMPACTED BY THE QUESTION IS AS A SOCIETY AS A SENATOR IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE WHAT'S THE POLICY GIVEN THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVETHAT YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN. AND WHAT WE WANNA DO IS HAVE A SOCIETY WHERE THE SIZE OF YOUR WALLET DOESN'T DETERMINE YOUR LIBERTY AND THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE JUSTICE AND VICTIMS ARE TAKEN CARE OF NOTHING AFFECTS THE VICTIMS RIGHTS LAWS THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THIS WE IN THE OPPOSITION ARE GONNA AND ADDRESS THAT MY CLOTHES DOESN'T ADDRESS IT ALL VICTIMS HAVE EVERY RIGHT THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD NOTHING CHANGES THAT LAW WHATSOEVER. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BEST THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIX THAT THAT INFORMS THE ADVOCATES ON THE ONE HAND AND THE JUDGES ON THE OTHER WHO DEAL WITH THE SYSTEM EVERY. SINGLE DAY. IN FIVE I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW YOU KERN WORKING THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS. IN THE- SAZH OF. WITH REGARDS TO THIS BY. THE MARKET PER WILL TO ATTRACT MEAN I JUST SAW THAT THE- AND HEARD ON THE FOR I JUST GO IT OVER THE WEEKEND THE- BEFORE THE PICTURE OF COURSE WITH. TO MAKE. SAND AND I KNOW IT I TRY DRESS FOR I KNOW I AM. EVERYBODY ME WE ALWAYS A- BUT WILL IF A WAY TO SO THE DOESN'T COME. THE UNDERLYING VALUE. DEAL WITH IT. YEAH I AM VERY SO. HOW WE CONSIDER A IDEA I'M I NEW TO THIS ISSUE I'M YOU TO THE SENATE PERIOD BUT I DO HAVE A WITH THREE HOW WEAK WHETHER OR NOT. THESE FEE IN THERE FOR NOW CALL TO PAY WHO ARE IN A CAN BE TAKEN AT THE BAR. MOTION THE TICKET BUT MEAN MANY MEAN THAT THE BECOME RESPONSE WHO IS PRICED CANCERS. FOR THE FINANCIAL- HARD THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE FACE ONCE THEY'RE PROVEN INNOCENT. SURE YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE LIVES I UNDERSTAND. YOURSELF ACTION THAT I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS YOU FOR BETWEEN NOW MORE PUT YOUR RIGHT I IF YOU'RE IN IF YOU CAN YOU'RE DID SOMETHING YOU PAY THE PRICE I EVERYBODY AGREES THAT. BUT WHICH TO DEAL WITH HERE IS HOW DO YOU CREATE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE PROSECUTORS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES. PAY FOR THE COST OF THE IMPOSITION ON PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE THEY'VE KEPT HIM IN JAIL. I SUSPECT THAT- THE DISAGREED. OFFICE SERVICES. WOULD STRONG HIM. TO THE PROTEGER. I COULD BE WRONG BUT I WOULD THINK SO. AND I WOULD ALSO THINK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING OF CHALLENGER THAT TO. DETERMINING THOSE COSTS. AND I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE- YOU THE WHOLE PURPOSE HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- BALANCE OUT PUBLIC SAFETY WITH. PEOPLE'S LIBERTY AND FAIRNESS. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX PERHAPS IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED THERE TRULY ARE. THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT FOR THAT ARREST AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLACED IN. AN AND CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL. ECONOMIC. OPPORTUNITIES IN PERIL. THEN YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO FIND TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO BE LIABLE FOR THAT- AND PROTECTING THEM MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED SO JUST THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. I'M I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME BECAUSE I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE COURT DOES. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT YOU DO. IN IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH. THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT. THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS FOR A BALANCE IN THAT REFLECTS- YOU KNOW THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL AS THE SAFETY. OF THE PUBLIC. IF YOU. THANK YOU ARM SENATOR IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT SHE STILL THAT APPEARANCES HAVE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE AFFORDED NO BAIL WAS UP AM I CORRECT 99% OF THE COURT APPEARANCES. BUT THE OPPOSITION STATED THAT- FAILURE TO APPEAR HAS INCREASED VERSUS ARE DECREASING- HOW CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT AND WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND- WHAT YOU STATED IN WHAT THE OPPOSITION BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE JUST WRONG. THEY'RE JUST WRONG PERIOD IT'S CERTAINLY CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO SAY SO BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL DATA FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE HAD THE SITUATION GOING ON LET'S LOOK AT NEW JERSEY OKAY. NEW JERSEY JAIL POPULATION DECLINED BY 47% IN FOUR YEARS AFTER PASSING REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CRIMES HAVE FALLEN STATEWIDE IN ALL CATEGORIES EXPRESSLY VIOLENT CRIME WHICH IS DOWN EIGHTEEN POINT 4% WE ARREST RATES BEFORE AND AFTER BILL REFORM REMAIN THE SAME COURT APPEARANCES RATES ARE AT NINETY PERCENT. AND THE FACT OKAY NEXT LET'S LOOK AT NEW YORK TERMS OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE GET NOT PERFECT EXAMPLES BUT THE GENERAL UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING THE NEW YORK IT THE ENACTED REFORMATORY TWENTY JOB POPULATION STATEWIDE DECREASED BY 30% CRIME DID NOT GO UP. OKAY SIMILARLY THE KENTUCKY IN KENTUCKY THAT I WENT AND VISITED YOU KNOW 25% FOR THE DATA COULD MISCHIEF OF SHOWS THAT MORE PRE TRIAL RELEASES DOES NOT COMPROMISE PUBLIC SAFETY MORE THAN THIRTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE CITED AND RELEASED IN TWENTY TWENTY. COMPARED TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REARREST FOR PEOPLE RELEASED PRETRIAL HAVE REMAINED STABLE IN COURT APPEARANCE CONTINUE TO STAY HIGH AT 93% TO GIVE YOU MORE EXAMPLES THEY TELL YOU THAT PP I SEE SAID THE SAME THING. WE SAID WE DID THE ANALYSIS WE HAVE THE ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS OF HAVING THAT THAT THAT THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL FROM APRIL TO SEPTEMBER IS WE HAVE SOME DATA TO SHOW. WHETHER WHAT THE ARGUMENTS ARE VERSUS WHAT THE REALITY IS AND THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO PROCEED. WITH THIS MEASURE SENATOR. SKINNER MY SO AND BY ANOTHER WHO FOR. HER PART THIS AND YOU KNOW. INCLUDING HR. AND SENATOR CO AUTHORS. HAVE CHOSEN THIS IT WILL TAKEN LIGHTLY IT IS GOOD FOR EFFORT DEAL WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT'S A HAPPENED. WITH RESPECT TO THE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE OFFERED. AND REPRESENTED AS THEY WERE REPRESENTED- IN IN THAT IN THE- BALLOT BALLOT BALLOT MEASURE IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU NINE ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE I THINK- ISSUE SHOWN INSIDE- EXTRAORDINARY. JORDAN BALES DO NOT. THREE THAT DECREASE CRIME IN KIND OF WAY TO ONLY GREW. THE DEBTORS BECAUSE IF THING WE- THOSE WHO WEALTHY- IT BERMAN ELEMENTARY WHO HAVE BACKED TO GAS WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO POST BAIL AND IT'S TO WORKING. WILL WHO FIND THEM- IN OR IN LIKE SAY FOR. LONG PERIODS OF- BETWEEN A RED. AND TRIAL SO I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT MOVING FORWARD. I AM SEEKING A MOST- WE HAVE A TO PASS. I REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE MOVE-BILL. EXPECTED TO MAKE WHEN SLIGHT COMMENT. ON ON THIS- ON THE SYNOLOGY THE INSURANCE CONCEPT- IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY AND THAT FAMILY MEMBER PASSES AWAY PRIOR TO THE AGE AT WHICH THE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WOULD- WOULD BE IN EFFECT. THE FAMILY IS REIMBURSED MOST INSURANCE THEY REIMBURSE AND SIMILAR ON A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER- INSURANCE POLICY- NOT SO WITH THE BILL NOT SO- BUT I'M OF THE BILL. IF YOU SEARCH FOR WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THE EIGHT MOSTLY ARGUES MAKING CLOSE- I'VE BEEN ABLE TO AND WAS TO QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE IS I ALSO WANT TO THINK OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION HAS BEEN. A STALWART IN THIS ISSUE VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND CONTINUES TO BE SO. ARM IN AND I THINK ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE MENTIONED HERE. I JUST WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS ONE. THAT THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S PART OF OUR OBLIGATION GOVERNMENT. AND THAT IS THE COST TO TAXPAYERS WE SAW THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS EVEN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THOSE NUMBERS I READ TO YOU IN TERMS OF JAIL POPULATIONS ALTER PEOPLE'S LIVES UPSIDE DOWN TO COST TAXPAYERS BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TEN. AND TWO AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS A DAY. I MEAN IT'S JUST A SYSTEM. IN ALL THE IF YOU WANT AND READ MY UTIS DICTIONARY. IS THE TERM I USE A LOCKING CARP FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE IN THE AUDIENCE IT MEANS HAVING A HOLE IN YOUR HEAD IT IT IS. EVERY LEVEL. IT'S DUMBER THAN ABOUT OVER HOW. IN SO. ASIDE ITS IMPACT AND THE COST WE DON'T OF THE TALK IN TERMS OF TAX PAYERS AND TO DO WITH WITH SENATOR- FOLKS- BOB- COM ABOUT LAWN FOR BUT I WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEM I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND A SIMILAR. BUT BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ADVOCATES OF THE DAY THE IT'S ABOUT MONEY IN THE ARGUMENTS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THIS THEY CHANGE EVERY DAY WHOEVER YOU THAT ALIGN YOURSELF WITH IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY AND I DON'T BLAME THE THEIR BUSINESS OKAY THIRTY BUSINESS FINE THEIR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE BUSINESS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT THEIR BUSINESS HAS A HUGE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE IMPACT ON SOCIETY. AND SO THEY WOULD THEY'LL COME UP WITH WHATEVER ARGUMENT THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH TO BE ABLE TO WIN THE DAY AND YOU KNOW I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR AND HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK IN THAT REGARD YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE WAS ONE BIT GAVE THREE EXAMPLES OF COULD HAPPEN BUT THOSE THREE EXAMPLES OF THREE EXAMPLES ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOVEL WILL TALK TO THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO SAY. BUT I THE BIG ISSUE IS AS YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. CENTRO TROUBLED THE- DISABLED BECAUSE I. TO SERVE. BUT I KNOW. BACK IN THE DAY- GIVE THIS IS A CHANNEL IS. BUT A RIGHTEOUS ONE. AND I'VE THE PATH WE'VE TAKEN THIS MESS. GIVEN THE HUMPHREY CASE WAITING FOR THAT TO SAY WHICH MY CHANGE OF. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPACTFUL PROBLEM ON PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT THIS MEASURE IN THE PERCENT PAYROLL MEASURE IN THE OTHER HOUSE. I THINK WHICH ACHIEVES A PROPER BALANCE AND INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE COURTS TO EACH COURT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL SCHEDULES OF ONE COUNTY WHICH SUMS A HUNDRED THOUSAND X. COUNTY THE SAME COST AS A MILLION BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND ALLOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE OF COURSE ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS WITH THE SITE IS LET'S GET STATEWIDE BILL SCHEDULE RIGHT LET'S HAVE A STATE WHAT BILL SCHEDULE. NOW THEY'RE AGAINST THIS TOMORROW IF WE DID SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE AGAINST THAT IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT FUNDED BY IT BUT IT'S YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THEIR SUPPORT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE BETTER WAYS TO TREAT ARE. THE CAR COMMUNITIES AND ACHIEVE PUBLIC SAFETY WITH THAT. AS RIVAL. THANK YOU SO HERTZBERG. HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON PER. CONSULTANT CALL ROLL ON S. B. TWO C. TWO. SB TWO SICK TO HER. D. PASTOR. BROWN ON REDFORD I'D- NO. TROUBLE NOTE. SKINNER SKINNER I. WELL THE ROLE OPEN. WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE FOR ABSENT THROUGH ON IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO YOU ARE FOUGHT THERE WE HAVE- SENATOR. MELINDA WITH US B. FOR CENTER WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED YOU MAY BE YOUR- PRESENTATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I DO WANT TO ASK I HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON TODAY TO TESTIFY WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE THEM. YOU JUST WANT TO BEHIND OKAY ALL RIGHTS ALL CALL THEM UP. WHEN THEY'RE READY R. EIGHT- I AM HERE TO. S. B. THREE FIFTY ALEXANDER IS LAW WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE FENTANYL DEATHS SENATORS YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL RECEIVED. THIS BOOK. IN YOUR OFFICE IT WAS DELIVERED EVERYONE'S OFFICE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK THROUGH THIS BOOK AND READ ABOUT OF THE VICTIMS OF FATAL POISONING IN HERE THAT CHOSE TO SHARE THEM WITH US THIS STARK HERE. THESE ARE THE LETTERS THAT I RECEIVED FROM PARENTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHO HAD CHILDREN WHO DIED FROM FENTANYL POISONING THESE ARE JUST RECEIVED IN A FEW DAYS. THIS DOESN'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DEATHS THAT HAVE. BEEN CAUSED BY THIS DRUG. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FENNO DEATHS ROSE IN CALIFORNIA BY MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. BETWEEN THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. ZACH DDA WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ROCKLIN CALIFORNIA STUDENT HE WAS A TRACK STAR A STRAIGHT A STUDENT A SELF TAUGHT MUSICIAN AND HAD A GOAL OF ONE DAY GOING TO STANFORD. AFTER WATCHING A MOVIE WITH HIS FAMILY HE WENT TO BED AFTER TELLING HIS FATHER I HAD A GOOD TIME LOVE YOU DAD GOOD NIGHT. THE NEXT DAY WHEN ZACH DIDN'T ANSWER KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR HIS DAD ENTERED HIS ROOM. AND FOUND THE SON HE LOVED SO MUCH SLUMPED OVER THE COMPUTER GEEK KEYBOARD AT HIS DESK UNRESPONSIVE. EXACTLY BY WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A PRESCRIPTION PAIN PILL FROM SOMEONE HE MET ON SNAPCHAT. IT TURNED OUT TO BE FENNEL AND IT WAS A LETHAL DOSE AND NOW ZACH'S PARENTS LIKE SO MANY OTHER WILL NEVER GET TO TELL THEIR CHILD THEY LOVE THEM AGAIN. ONE FINAL FIRST CAME INTO THE UNITED STATES IT WAS USED BY HARD CORE ST YEARS YEARS USERS ADDICTED TO HEROIN. NOW THE CARTELS ARE TRYING TO DRY IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS HIGH SCHOOL KIDSCOLLEGE STUDENTS. ADULTS WHO'VE NEVER USED DRUGS OR DON'T HAVE AN ADDICTION PROBLEM. THE SYNTHETIC BUT NO WAS SOLD ILLEGALLY AS A POWDER IT'S DROPPED ON THE BLOTTER PAPER TO PUT AN EYE DROPPERS AND NASAL SPRAYS ARE MADE INTO PELLETS THAT LOOK LIKE OTHER PRESCRIPTIONS LIKE PERCOCET XANAX- ADDERALL. FENTANYL IS FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROIN IT'S SO POTENT THAT THE- THAT AN AMOUNT THE SIZE OF THREE GRAINS OF SUGAR IS LEGAL. THE SUGAR PACKET THAT YOU'LL FIND IN ANY DINER ANY COPY STORE. HAPPEN THE SUGAR PACKET IS A LETHAL DOSE OF HEROIN HALF OF THE SUGAR PACKET. YOU TAKE OUT ABOUT THREE GRAINS OF THE SUGAR AND THAT'S A LETHAL DOSE OF FENTANYL. THE REASON FENNEL IS BECOMING SO POPULAR RETURN WITH DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS IT TAKES SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT TO THAT OF HEROIN AND A LITTLE FENNEL GOES A LONG WAY AND MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. THE PROBLEM IS ALSO THAT IT'S SO POTENT THAT JUST A SLIP OF A HAND WHEN YOU'RE MIXING IT OR RESIDUAL DUST OF FENTANYL IN A BLENDER THAT YOU'RE USING TO MIX THIS UP. RESULT IN A BATCH THAT CAN KILL MULTIPLE USERS INSTANTLY. THERE'S AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN AND- PSYCHIATRIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HE SAID THAT HE HAS DOCUMENTED CASES WHERE THEY HAVE HAD TO GIVE A DOSE OF NOR CAN WHICH IS A DRUG USED TO REVERSE SOMEONE WHO'S OVERDOSED. OR DAVE DAVE HAD TO GIVE SOMEONE NOR CAN EIGHT TIMES. TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS EIGHT TIMES. FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TYPICALLY BUT THAT MANY DOSES OF NOR CAN. IT IS NOT JUST HARDCORE DRUG USERS DYING FROM FENTANYL IT IS MOM'S IT IS COACHES IT IS LAWYERS PIZZA DELIVERY GUYS. SOLAR PANEL DELIVERS YOU NAME IT. IT'S AFFECTING EVERYONE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PRINCE. MUSICAL GENIUS IN THE INDUSTRY HE DIED FROM TAKING COUNTERFEIT BIKE IT IN THAT HAD FINALISED. AND THE RATE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN DEATHS FROM FENTANYL IS GROWING THE FASTEST BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE AMERICA THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DEATH RATE INCREASED ONE HUNDRED AND 40% EACH YEAR. FAKE FAT NO PILLS CAN BE EASILY PURCHASED BY KIDS ONLINE USING SNAPCHAT OR SOME OTHER APP AND IT'S DELIVERED RIGHT TO THEIR HOME YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN KNOW IT. ACCORDING TO AN NBC NEWS REPORT IN JANUARY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN SACRAMENTO ISSUED A MULTI COUNT INDICTMENT ACCUSING TEN PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA OF TRAFFICKING IN FENTANYL LACED OXY CODE ON PILLS. PROSECUTORS SAID WIRETAPS SHOWED THAT THE DEFENDANTS WERE AWARE. THAT MULTIPLE DEATHS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA HAD BEEN LINKED TO THOSE PILLS AND THEY KEPT ON SELLING THEM. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS ALEXANDER CAP ALITO. DIED AFTER TAKING A PILL THAT HAD FIVE TIMES THE FATAL AMOUNT OF ILLICIT FENTANYL. A FACT SHE HAD NO IDEA OF WHEN SHE PURCHASED THAT PILL SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS TAKING THE PAIN RELIEVER OXY CODE OWN. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HER FAMILY AND OTHERS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO CRAFT A THOUGHTFUL PROPOSAL. SB THREE FIFTY IS BASED OFF OF AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY THREE WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. WHICH REQUIRES THE COURT TO ADVISE AN INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF IT DO YOU AYE THE DRINKING AND DRIVING COULD RESULT IN THE DEATH OF ANOTHER PERSON AND IF THEY CONTINUE THIS BEHAVIOR IN KILL SOMEONE WHILE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. OF ALCOHOL THEY COULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER THEY COULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER. NOT NECESSARILY BUT THEY COULD BE. SB THREE FIFTY WOULD REQUIRE THE SAME ADVISEMENT BE READ TO AN INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING FENTANYL. THIS BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE THE KEY ELEMENT OF IMPLIED MALICE FOR A PROSECUTOR. TODAY MARKS FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE DAY THAT ALEXANDER CAP LATER DIED FROM FENTANYL. FIFTEEN MONTHS SORRY TODAY ALSO MARKS SIX MONTHS TO THE DAY THAT ALEX NIBBLED DIED FROM FENTANYL. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU NOW FOR YOUR FULL ATTENTION SENATORS AS YOU LIVING CARE LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THE TESTIMONY OF MY TWO WITNESSES MATT COMPLETO ALEXANDER'S DAD IN AMY NEVIL ALEX'S MOM BOTH OF WHOM LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO FEND OFF. MATT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE EACH WITNESS TWO MINUTE TO THEIR TESTIMONY TWO MINUTES APIECE THANK YOU. IT'S UP TO YOU WHICH ONE GOES FIRST MAN. IN SEPTEMBER TWO AND A HALF. TWO FIVE. YOU KEEP YOUR THERE'S ALSO. WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR MASK ON PLEASE LOGIN. SORRY MY GLASSES GET UP WHEN HE I DID MY BEST. MY NAY IS MATT LEADER. I'M STAY HERE BEFORE YOU DID. IS THE FATHER OF ALEX. WHO IS KILLED ON DECEMBER TWO THIRD TWO NINETEEN BUDGET COUNTERFEIT PILL WHICH CAN ALL THE OF FAT. NOTHING WE DO HERE TODAY WILL BRING BACK MY DAUGHTER FOR THOSE WE HAVE ALREADY LOST. I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE THOUSANDS WILL BE DECEPTIVELY AND FATALLY POISONED IN THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T TAKE DECISIVE ACTION NOW. THIS BILL HAS BEEN DRAFTED WITH ONE GOAL TO SAVE LIVES. THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT PUNITIVE. IT'S PREVENTATIVE. MODELED AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL WATSON WROTE SB THREE FIFTY PROVIDES DRUG DEALERS WITH A FAIR WARNING. IT INFORMS THEM THAT THE DRUGS THEY ARE SELLING COULD RESULT IN SOMEONE'S DEATH. WITH FENTANYL BEING SOLD UNDER FALSE PRETENSES TO UNWITTING CONSUMERS SB THREE FIFTY IS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO A DEADLY THREAT. BEFORE AFFECTED ALL EMERGED ON THE DRUG SCENE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN DRUG DEALERS HAD SOME BASIS FOR CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATHS THAT RESULTED FROM SELLING AND LET'S IT DRUGS. HOWEVER THIS IS CHANGED TODAY PEOPLE ARE BEING DECEIVED PARTICULARLY WHEN CONSUMING COUNTERFEIT PILLS PRESSED TO MIMIC LEGITIMATE PHARMACEUTICALS INSTEAD THEY CONTAIN NOTHING BUT A NEUTRAL BASE AND FENTANYL. FIFTY SPENT ACT IS BEING DONE SOLELY FOR FINANCIAL GAIN WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE. ELICIT THAT AND ALL THOSE DONE WHAT NO OTHER BLACK MARKET HAS EVER DONE. IT KILLS WITH A SINK USE. IT IS KILLING THE COUNSELOR USER THE FIRST TIME DRUG USER AND THOSE SELF MEDICATING. THIS GROUP OF NON ADDICTS IS NOW THE FASTEST GROWING AND LEAST RECOGNIZE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR DRUG RELATED DEATHS IN THE U. S. ADDICTS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM FAT AND ALL EITHER MANY ARE BEING ROBBED OF THEIR CHANCE TO RECOVER. IN THIS NEW ERA OF ILLICIT FAT AND ALL WE MUST BE CAPABLE OF IMPOSING SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SELL DEADLY DRUGS EVEN AFTER THEY KNOW THE DANGERS. ALEXANDER'S LAW IS A WARNING THAT THE DEALER CHOSE TO IGNORE IT AND PROSECUTORS WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO IMPOSE A STIFFER PENALTY. AS A BORDER STATE CALIFORNIA IS A HUB FOR ILLICIT FENTANYL DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THIS NATION WE ARE OBLIGATED TO TAKE ACTION. I ASK THAT YOU PASS THIS BILL ON TO THE FULL SENATE FOR DEBATE. OUR CHILDREN ARE DYING FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING. AND WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE CANNOT BRING ALEX OR THE THOUSANDS WE HAVE ALREADY LOST BACK BUT HER LAW WILL SAVE OTHERS. AS OUR LEADERS YOUR PASSAGE OF THIS BILL TODAY WILL DEMONSTRATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA FROM THIS RAPIDLY GROWING DANGER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. MY NEXT WITNESSES AMY NOVEL. GOOD MORNING SENATORS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME I AMY NOVEL FROM ORANGE COUNTY. AND THIS IS MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON ALEXANDER. ALEXANDER DIED NINE MONTHS AGO TODAY AND JUNE TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY. AFTER TAKING A SINGLE PILL THAT HE BELIEVED WAS AN OXY CODE OWN. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A COUNTERFEIT TELL ME DEFENSE NOW. I FOUND ALEX A DEAD ON THE FLOOR OF HIS BEDROOM. THIS IS HOW MOST OF OUR KIDS ARE DYING IN THE NIGHT ALONE IN THEIR BEDROOMS. ALEX THAT IS PULLED FROM A DEALER HE CONNECTED WITH ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE KNOW WHO THE DEALER IS THIS DEALER IS STILL SELLING HIS DRUGS ONLINE. AT LEAST TWO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM THE STEELERS COUNTERFEIT PILLS. ONE BEFORE ALEX AND ONE AFTER. THE YOUNG MAN THAT DIED BEFORE ALEX DIED IN FRONT OF THE DEALER IN THE DEALER'S APARTMENT. ALEX WAS DUPED BY THIS DRUG DEALER AND THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY. ALEX BELIEVE HE WAS BUYING OXYCODONE THAT'S WHAT HE INTENDED TO TAKE AND HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEALER SOLD HIM DENTAL UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. THIS IS DEALER NO HIS TOES ARE DEADLY FAKES. IF NOT SB THREE FIFTY WILL MAKE SURE HE IS INFORMED JUST HOW DANGEROUS HIS ACTIONS CAN BE. IF HE DOES NOTE THAT IT'S MALICE IS NOT JUST A SMALL TIME STREET DEALER HE'S COMMITTING FRAUD AND MURDER. ALEXANDER'S LAW. GIVES A LOT OUT AUGUST FOR THE TOOLS TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. SINCE AN OLD. AND IT'S IMPACT IS FELT IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE FROM THE FIRST TIME USER TO THOSE SUFFERING WITH LONG TERM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PEOPLE ARE BEING POISONED BY THIS DEADLY CHEMICAL. FENTANYL DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. IT'S KILLING EVERY RACE EVERY GENDER RICH OR POOR AND IT'S KILLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. NO ONE DESERVES TO DIE THIS WAY. YOU MIGHT BE ASKING YOURSELF SO WHERE'S THIS DRUG DEALER NOW. IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE YOU THAT HE IS FREE LIVING HIS LIFE CONTINUING TO SELL DRUGS TO UNSUSPECTING KIDS AND ADULTS.

THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSIONS- AS IT RELATES TO THIS MATTER ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR- CONCERNS. FROM ANY MEMBER ON THIS BILL. SOONER OR TROUBLE. TO- THIS IS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. ON THIS MATTER AND- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD- I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE- FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT FORTH AND TO. WHO TO THE PARENTS HERE PRESENT THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. ACCIDENTALLY THROUGH THE OVERDOSE OF THE FENTON ALL- WHERE DOES I A MY SINCERE SINCERE CONDOLENCES- JUST AN OBSERVATION I NOTICED MANY OF YOU FOLKS MENTIONED THE AGE OF YOUR CHILDREN. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AGE AS YOURS. SO I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE CANNOT IMAGINE- THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN- THIS ISSUE. THE FUNDAMENTAL EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN RAVAGING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION IN RECENT YEARS. IT HITS HOME AND SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY THREE WHICH IS THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT- US ON THIS COMMITTEE. THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE. AND IN RECENT MONTHS 50% OF ALL THE OVERDOSE DEATHS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FENTANYL. FENTANYL IS A SYNTHETIC OPIATE THAT CAN BE FORMULATED TO BE FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT THAN HEROIN. AND FATAL FENTANYL OVERDOSES OCCUR IN AMERICA UP OF THOUSANDS OF A GRAM. OFTENTIMES THE USER OF THESE TRUCKS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DRUGS THEY ARE CONSUMING CONTAIN THIS DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE AND FAR TOO MANY HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT. THIS CONSTITUTES MORE THAN NEGLIGENCE ON THE MANUFACTURER'S BEHALF AND SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT IT IS. SB THREE FIFTY IS ONCE MET A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS ADDRESSING THIS EPIDEMIC. IT IS A WARNING JUST LIKE A WARNING WHEN YOU GET A D. Y. AND IT LETS THE- PERSON THAT'S BEEN. CONVICTED OF THE DIY TO LET THEM KNOW THAT IF THEY CONTINUE ON THAT PATH. THAT THEIR ACTIONS WOULD HAVE SEARS CONTACT CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING. THE LOSS OF LIFE. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVES A WARNING TO THOSE WHO MANUFACTURE IN THE WHO SELL. THESE THESE DRUGS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT IF THEY CONTINUE IN THAT PRACTICE BUT THEIR ACTIONS HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES WHICH YOU HEAR. IN THIS ERA AND IN IN THE CAPITAL ON THE SO CALLED ARE. UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS. OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IT IS WITH DATA UNDERSTANDING. THAT IT IS JUST A WARNING. JUST THE BEGINNING STOP. BUT I A WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND REQUEST FOR YOUR EYEBALL IT AND MOVE IT WHEN THE TIME COMES MISAPPROPRIATE THANK YOU CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. BUT OF ALL I WANNA A- I WANT TO JUST. FIVE ALL OF THE- PARENTS GRANDPARENTS FRIENDS- WHO CAME OUT TODAY PHYSICALLY ARE ON THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR DIRECTOR TRAGEDY- THAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED- THAT IS NOT EASY- THAT IS- IT'S NOT EASY THAT IS. YEAH I KNOW HAVING EXPERIENCE AWESOME MY FAMILY. IT IS VERY HARD TO TALK ABOUT. AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT- FIVE ALSO- HI. YESTERDAY I HAD A ASSUME WITH A GROUP OF. PARENTS COULD I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE THAT DIRECT COMMUNICATION I APPRECIATE THEM TAKING THE TIME AND ARE BEING ABLE TO HAVE A VERY CANDID- AND YOU KNOW DIFFICULT ON DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS ISSUE- I'VE ALSO I. READ EVERY SINGLE EMAIL- THAT I RECEIVED ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE ALSO WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THE BOOKLET WITH A BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR STORIES AND I REVIEWED THAT COVER TO COVER AND IT WAS ABSOLUTE HEARTBREAK IN THIS WHOLE SITUATION. IS JUST IT'S SUCH A DEEP TRAGEDY AND IT'S GETTING WORSE. WE ARE AS I MENTIONED TO THE GROUP I SPOKE WITH YESTERDAY IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. DIED OF OVERDOSE DEATHS LAST YEAR THEY WERE NOT ALL FEDERAL- BUT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE WERE. THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT WAS A RECORD AND NEARLY DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS RECORD. SAN FRANCISCO IS ON TRACK TO BREAK THE RECORD AGAIN THIS YEAR IF THE FIRST FEW MONTHS ARE INDICATIVE OF THE REST OF THE YEAR WHICH I. SUSPECT THAT TRAGICALLY THEY WILL BE IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHETHER THEY ARE FIFTEEN WHETHER THEY'RE THIRTY WORTH OF THEIR SIXTY YEARS OLD THESE ARE ALL. HUMAN BEINGS THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS. OR NEIGHBORS MAY HAVE. FAMILIES AND NAY- AND THEIR LIVES MATTER. AND WE ARE FAILING- RIGHT NOW AND FEDERAL IS JUST A IT'S A DESPICABLE SUBSTANCE. AND IT IS JUST HARMING SO MANY PEOPLE. BOND IF. THIS BILL. HI AN INCREASING THE PENALTIES BECAUSE I IT IS A WARNING BUT IT'S A WARNING ABOUT THE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF ULTIMATELY PROSECUTING AND CONVICTING SOMEONE OF MURDER- IF THIS WERE AN EFFECTIVE- WAY OF REDUCING. DRUG USE REDUCING- DRUG DEALING IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT AND CONSIDER- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WILL AND THE REASON THAT I SAY THAT AS WE HAVE. DONE THIS BEFORE. WE HAVE- WE'VE GONE THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN THIS COUNTRY. OF INCARCERATING DRUG DEALERS INCLUDING LOW LEVEL DRUG DEALERS. FOR LONG LONG PERIODS OF TIME DRUG DEALERS WHOSE DEALING LEAD TO DEATH OR NOT. PUTTING THEM AWAY FOR YEARS OR DECADES ARM BANDS. AND THAT ID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT DID NOT REDUCE DRUG USE THE NOT pAND OVERDOSE OR MUCH WORSE NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. WE ADOPTED THOSE HARSH PENALTIES. AND SO YOU KNOW PUTTING MORE PEOPLE WAY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IS NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS AS LONG AS THERE IS DEMAND- THE SUPPLIER WILL BE THERE AND THE DEALERS WILL BE THERE. AND WE NEED TO. AND WE NEED WE NEED TO TAKE BETTER APPROACH. TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS BOB THIS ISSUE- WE CONTINUE- TO PREVENT HARM REDUCTION AND TO PROHIBIT. OF HARM REDUCTION METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN- TO ACTUALLY HELP. IT IS ACTUALLY STILL A LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE SOMEONE WITH A FRONTAL STRIP SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SWAP AND TEST THEIR DRUGS TO SEE IF FEDERAL IS THAT THAT'S A LEGAL RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. THERE A LOT OF THEIR A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO SAVE LIVES I JUST I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS PUTTING HAVING LONGER SENSES OF PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT ANY OVERDOSES- AND I THINK THAT IS A FALSE HOPE AND SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA SHOOT TO RESTRAIN YOUR COMMENTS REALLY WE RESPECTED EVERY WHAT THIS YEAR WHAT WHETHER YOUR POSITION WAS WE RESPECTED SO. WE EXPECT THE SAME TO YOU. BYE BYE. OKAY FINE. IT'S A WHOLE LOT OF OVERDOSE. US SENATORS PLAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- ASCENDER MELINDA'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'RE WORSE NOT UNDERSTANDING OUR SEAT IN THE ANALYSIS IN IN THE- MATERIALS THAT THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS OFFERED AND- EXCEPT AS FAR AS MY REDID THE AMENDMENTS THAT IF THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE BILL THE BILL WOULD DO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED WHICH IS GIVE A WARNING. AND THAT THE BILL WITHOUT THOSE AMENDMENTS DOES MORE THAN JUST THE WARNING IT ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES A- DIRECTION IN FACT THAT- MIGHT SUBSTANTIATE- AN ADDITIONAL RATHER READ A JUSTIFICATION FOR- PROSECUTORIAL ACTION NO I APPRECIATE THAT THE THAT YOU'RE THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO. SEE THAT POTENTIALLY HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR IN IN ANY- COURT CASE FOR MOTIVESAND SUCH TO BE DETERMINED IN THE PROCESS OF THE DETERMINATION IN- IN THE COURT HEARING AND IF WE COMPARE THIS TO FOR EXAMPLE THE D. Y. WARNINGS THEY DO NOT HAVE A THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT ELEMENT AND SO- I WONDER IF YOU WOULD TAKE THOSE AMENDMENT THE AMENDMENT BECAUSE I COULD SUPPORT THE BILL. WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- THANK YOU SENATORS AND WHAT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THERE STILL IS THE WARNING JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR ON THE RECORD BUT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SAID THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE WAS TO- REMOVE THE IMPLIED MALICE FROM THE BILL AND JUST HAVE THE ADVISEMENT READ- TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. COULD CAUSE THE ROOT DO NOT RESULT IN THE DEATH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SO IT REALLY TOOK. THE GUTS OF THE BILL AWAY BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHEN SOMEONE IS BEFORE COURT BEFORE JUDGE. IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THE JUDGE IS GOING TO INDICATE TO THAT PERSON IT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR YOU'RE ENGAGING IN. IS HARMFUL IT'S GOING TO HURT SOMEONE THAT'S WHY THEY WERE THERE BEFORE THE JUDGE SO TELLING THE JUDGE TO. COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE PERSON. IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE IMPLIED MALICE IN THE BILL AS A WARNING AS AN ADVISEMENT AND I JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT- IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE. THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER. IT'S AN OPTION IT'S NOT MANDATORY SOME DA'S MAY NOT CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE. OTHERS MAY FIND CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY FIND THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE IT'S NOT DESIGNED FOR LIBERAL USE IT'S DESIGNED FOR VERY JUDICIOUS USE BUT FOR. ME TO REMOVE THE PART OF THE BILL THAT IS THE HEART OF THE BILL WHICH IS THE ABILITY- TO USING IMPLIED MALICE I COULD NOT AGREE TO REMOVING THAT FROM THE BILL AND ONLY HAVE A BILL THAT SAYS. THE JUDGE SHOULD READ TO THE DEFENDANT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS DANGEROUS I THINK. THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT SELL TIME AND FORTUNE I COULD NOT- EXCEPT THAT AMENDMENT IN YOUR CLOTHES. YOU MADE MORE SORRY YOUR CONFERENCE WILL IN FIVE MINUTES. IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU THE- TO THE MORNING THAT IS GIVEN IN THE DRIVING K. AND WOOD AT THE DRUNK DRIVING CASE DO NOT INCLUDE THAT MALICE. AND SO YOU USE THAT A- AND WHICH- IS ANALOGY THAT I. AGREE AND I WOULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH OF WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE USING. IF WE ARE MAKING THAT COMPARISON- HOWEVER THAT A DECISION WHICH YOU NOW SAY MAKES YOUR BILL NOT USEFUL THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE IT AND YOUR- THE ANALOGY TOWARDS WHAT WE HAVE ALLOWED. IN STATUTE ON DRUNK DRIVING. SO I THINK I- AGAIN I THINK THAT. THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION IS REASONABLE AND AS YOU KNOW. ALL OF OUR BILLS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE COMMITTEE PROCESS AND OF OUR COMMITTEES CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE. MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN IN WHAT IT WHATEVER THE FIELD IS THAT IS OF THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERN IN IN THIS CASE AND PUBLIC SAFETY WE HAVE CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE- PART NOT ONLY EXTREMELY FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF CALIFORNIA STATUTES BUT ALSO JUDICIAL PROCESS HE'S PROSECUTORIAL PROCESS HE'S IN OTHERS. AND I THINK THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE HAVE VALUE AND I CANNOT SPEAK FOR MY OTHER COLLEAGUES BUT I HAVE I SUSPECT THAT THIS BILL WOULD. BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN MOST OF US DON'T EXPECT TO EVER HAVE ANY OF OUR BILLS FLY THROUGH WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF AMENDMENT. SENATOR SKINNER I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS COMPROMISES ON BILLS THAT I'VE RIGHT BEFORE THE SENATE AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY WE ALL HAVE TO DO IT. KNOWING GETS THEIR BILL THROUGH GENERALLY ON THE FIRST PASS WHAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED ME TO DO THOUGH ESSENTIALLY WAS TO TURN IN A BILL THAT SAYS A JUDGE NEEDS TO ADVISE SOMEONE THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR THEY'RE ENGAGING IN. COULD KILL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THAT'S IT WE DON'T NEED A LOT TO DO THAT. A JUDGE IS ALREADY DOING THAT WHEN THE WHEN AND DEFENDANT IS IN FRONT OF THEM TO THE STATUTE THAT YOU DESCRIBED AS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO MAYOR. I'M SORRY SAY AGAIN THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE ADVISORY. HUNDRED DO YOU AYE CASE. SO YOU USED THE ANALOGY OF YOUR INTENTION TO PUT INTO STATUTE THAT WHICH WE DO IN DO YOU AYE CASES. THAT'S INCORRECT. THE BILL THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT CORRECT IN NIGHT I'M SORRY IF IT EITHER SOME MISUNDERSTANDING IN IN THE U. DISPOSSESSED DISCUSSIONS YOU HAVE HAD ABOUT THIS BILL BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT CORRECT IT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW. A PROSECUTOR ON A SUBSEQUENT INDICTMENT TO USE THE IMPLIED MALICE IN THE EVENT THEY WANT TO USE- A MURDER CHARGE I DON'T HAVE TO BUT IT'S GIVES THEM THE OPTION THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES THAT'S PART OF THE ADVISEMENT WHEN THEY TELL THEM YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER IN THIS BOX. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES. SO ARE YOU. I DON'T KNOW- I'M NOT SURE YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. RESOLVE THIS IN A FEW MINUTES WE HAVE LEFT IN THIS COMMITTEE HEARING BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT. MY EIGHT MY GOAL IS NOT TO MAKE IT- YOU KNOW MORE PUNITIVE THAN NECESSARY OR MORE PUNITIVE PERHAPS IN LIGHT. WE HAVE ALREADY SET UP FOR DO YOU AYE CONVICTIONS. HOWEVER IT DOES SO IT IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE HAVE LISTED IN THE D. Y. WELL AND WE HAVE EXISTING STATUTE. THAT IF THERE IS IN FACT PROVEN TO BE MALICE AND IF THERE IS KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS FENMORE SORRY YOUR CONFERENCE WILL END IN ONE. AND IF THERE IS KNOWLEDGE BY THE DEALER. THAT THERE WAS FENTANYL IN THE SUBSTANCES THEY CAN BE CHARGED WITH. AND THERE AND THE ANALYSIS CITES THE VERY STATUTES THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS THAT ALLOW SUCH. AN I- IS I INDICATED COULD SUPPORT THE ADDITION OF THE WARNING AS USED IN THE CLOSE BUT NOT THE ADDITIONAL- FREEZING WHICH IS NOT IN OUR STATUTE REGARDING D. WEISS AND. SKINNER SKINNER SAYS SENATOR A COMMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO- APPLAUD SENATOR MELENDEZ FOR ORGANIZING ALL OF THESE FAMILIES- I AM. AND PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PACKAGE WHICH I DID READ SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AND YOUR OFFICE THE CREDIT FOR PUTTING IT TOGETHER- AND I ALSO WANT TO SALUTE THE FAMILIES FOR. SHOWING UP AND FOR CALLING IN. AND SHARING YOUR STORIES ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES WHO WERE LOST TO THIS DRUG. YOU KNOW I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK FAMILIES AND FRIENDS TO RE LIVE- THESE MOMENTS BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT IT CANNOT BE EASY FOR YOU TO DO SO- IN THIS I THINK HAPPENS TO BE A COMMITTEE WHERE SO OFTEN- FAMILY MEMBERS FROM ALL SIDES. ARE ASKED TO RE LIVE- PAINFUL MOMENTS AND EXPERIENCES AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL DOES OPEN THE DOOR. FOR PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE- DEALER SELLERS. HOWEVER THAT IS DEFINED- WITH MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER. AND YOU KNOW ACCIDENTAL DRUG OVERDOSE AND I BELIEVE THAT MOST OVERDOSES ARE ACCIDENTAL- IN MY MIND DOES NOT EQUATE MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER. WHAT DRUG OVERDOSE IT IS NOT HOWEVER. I'M WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO CONTAIN YOURSELVES IF YOU CAN YOU'RE GOING TO BE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE ROOM. WHAT LEAVE THE ROOM AND LEAVE IT LEAVE THE ROOM. WHAT DRUG OVERDOSE IT IS SAD AND UNFORTUNATE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. TALKING ABOUT OPENLY AND WITHOUT STIGMA. WE OVER MEDICATE WE SELF DIAGNOSE WE STIGMATIZE DEPRESSION. CAN WE DO IT ALL IN THE SILENCE. OF DARKNESS AND WE COLLECTIVELY ARE AT FAULT FOR NOT HAVING MUCH MORE OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES A NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS ON THE PHONE WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SAID BUT NO IS THE MURDERER. NO IS THE MURDERER. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE WE SHOULD I WOULD FULLY SUPPORT US PUTTING FINAL ON TRIAL. WE CERTAINLY SHOULD. ABSOLUTELY FRANCISCO SAID THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO WORK. AN EXPENSIVE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE OVER INCARCERATION POLICIES ALSO DO NOT WORK HOW DO WE FIND. THE RIGHTEOUS MIDDLE. THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AS HARD AS THIS IS TO SAY AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF OF IT ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW JUSTICE AND RETRIBUTION ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME THING AND IT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF POLICY MAKERS TO CREATE POLICY- THAT DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO BRING BACK LOVED ONES PEOPLE ON THE PHONE ALSO MENTION THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH DRUGS IT'S NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO GET DRUGS. THAT ARE UNREGULATED. IT DOESN'T ADDRESS ANY OF THAT. AND WHEN WE ARE PURCHASING DRUGS OFF THE MARKET THERE IS RISK WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. IF SOMEONE IS SELLING AND THEN THERE ARE NO LONGER SELLING MAYBE THEY'VE HAD A COME TO JESUS MOMENT THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS THEY STOPPED DOING IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME WITH THEIR PRODUCT HAPPENS TO BE ON THE MARKET OR SOMEONE THEN TAKES THAT UP AND TARTS DOING IT. DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. DOESN'T ADDRESS IF YOU'RE SELLING AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SELLING. YOU'VE JUST BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT. DOESN'T ADDRESS THE FACT THAT MAYBE YOU'VE GONE TO THE BLACK MARKET TO BUY AN UNREGULATED PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO OR YOU CAN'T PURCHASE A REGULATED PALE. ALL OF THOSE ARE POLICY ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF YOU'RE GOING TO ESSENTIALLY OPEN THE DOOR TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO BE CHARGED WITH MURDER. IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT. AND SUPPORT THIS BILL IF THE AMENDMENTS THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTED AND- IF IT COMES UP FOR. ME AND IF DURING THIS PROCESS THAT IS STILL AN OPTION I WOULD BE VERY WILLING TO- SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM RIGHT NOW. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU SUBMIT COME LONGER AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM. ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I TO WANT TO COMMEND. SENATOR MELINDA IS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR BUT- HAS BEEN ARTICULATED THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES IT'S NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY IN CALIFORNIA PRIOR CROSSES NATION. WHO DOESN'T SYMPATHIZE AND EMPATHIZE. TO PUT FAMILY MEMBERS WHO'VE LOST SOMEONE WHO FRIENDS TO DRUG OVERDOSE WE ALL LOVE SOMEONE. WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE WE'VE PROBABLY PURSUE HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. FROM DRUG OVERDOSE HAVE- BUT WHAT IS MISSING HERE ADDS I THINK SOME OF THE SENATORS HAVE TRIED TO ARTICULATE- THERE IS A LEVEL OF. CULPABILITY. FROM THE USER. AND THE- N. N. AND YEAH AND. AND AND WHAT WE NEED TO UNDER. THE IS ABOUT DRUGS WHETHER IT'S ILLEGAL STREET DRUGS. OR PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS PRESCRIBED TO A USER OF BY BATCH I SHOULD SAY THAT'S NOT PRESCRIBED BY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THERE'S INHERENT RISK IN DOING SO EVEN FROM LEGAL DRUGS WE HAVE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PRESCRIBED DRUGS AND THEIR KID OR THEIR NEIGHBOR SOMEONE GETS INTO THEIR MEDICAL CAMERA TAKES THOSE DRUGS ANY DIABLES. THANK YOU SAYS WELL SO WE HAVE PLENTY EXAMPLES OF. PEOPLE USING LEGAL DRUGS AND OVERDOSING SO WE OFFERED UP AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT I THINK WOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE TO YOUR- THESE DRUG RELATED FATALITIES WE HAVE AN I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT HOWEVER PROVIDING LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH YET ANOTHER TOOL TO- GET LONGER SENTENCES WE NOW HISTORY HAS SHOWN. THAT DOES NOT TO TEAR DRUG SALES IT DOESN'T DETER CRIME WHATSOEVER ALL WE DO IS INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN AS I THINK THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATED. IT'S A SUPPLY DEMAND SO YOU LOCK SOMEONE UP FOR FIFTY YEARS IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEONE QUICKLY THAT VERY NEXT DAY THE TAKE THAT PLACE AND CONTINUE TO SELL. THESE DRUGS. SO THESE POLICY ONLY EXACERBATE- THE DISPARITIES AS WE STATED AS- REYES HAZARD RELATES TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WE KNOW. ALL THE HARM IN THE WAR ON DRUGS AND I'M SURE WE ALL SYMPATHIZE WITH ANYONE WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE. ON THIS I THINK WE HAVE A MEASURE WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL AND OBJECTIVE HERE. INTO QUITE- THIS TO THE D. U. I. WARNING IT'S CLEAR BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT AS WELL WITH THE DO YOU WHY DO YOU ARE YOU WANT SOMEBODY YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL AGAIN IF SOMEBODY DIED YES YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH. MANSLAUGHTER YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH MURDER BECAUSE YOU NORMALLY. DID YOU GET INTO SOME PERSON THERE BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LEVEL OF CULPABILITY. IN SELLING SOMEONE A LEGAL DRUG IN ME AS A PURCHASER TAKING IT AND THEN. HAVING SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUYING SOMETHING ILLEGAL SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS HERE SO. ON THAT MEASURE- YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE MEMORIES SHOULD TAKE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE A MEMBER NOT BE MORE HAPPY SUPPORTERS MEASURE TODAY BUT WITHOUT THAT. I TO CANNOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. SO I WILL. OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SKINNER THANK YOU FOR THE CLOSE THANK YOU CHEER FOR THAT EXPLANATION BUT I ALSO WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL WE ARE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER BECAUSE- THE- THERE IS IN STATUTE NOW AS IS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT IF A PERSON KNOWINGLY SELLS. ANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES THAT THE KNOWINGLY. F. SENTINEL. AND THERE IS THEN A DEATH THERE ARE. MULTIPLE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH THAT PERSON CAN BE CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER WITH OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO THE DEATH OF THE PERSON WHO TOOK THE SUBSTANCE. AND THOSE ARE ON THE BOOKS AND THE AND IT CITED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND THE WARNING PART EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THEM. REQUIRES THEN THE WARNING TO SAY WHAT THE POSSIBLE FUTURE CRIMINAL LIABILITY IS THAT THERE IS CRIMINAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND YOUR THE BILL WITHOUT AMENDMENTS DOESN'T NECESSARILY CREATE A WHOLE NEW STATUTE FOR NEW CRIMINAL LIABILITY. IT JUST CAN CAN. CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE ENDED IN WHATEVER THE NEXT CIRCUMSTANCE IS FOR THE PROSECUTOR PROSECUTOR TO BE ABLE TO USE INTENTION AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE ANY CURRENT STATUTE. THAT WOULD PUT THE PERSON WHO SOLD IT IN A CRIMINAL LIABILITY SITUATION THEY ARE STILL IN THAT SITUATION. AND IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE SUPPORTING YOUR INTENT TO MAKE SURE THAT A PERSON. DOES HAVE THAT WARNING AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE STATUTES ON THE BOOKS THAT CAN LEAD TO THEIR CONVICTION. IF THERE'S A DEATH IN SUCH CASE SO I JUST WANTED TO FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO'VE COME HERE IN SUPPORT. THAT THE BILL FERMENTED STILL GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF IT ACHIEVES MUCH OF WHAT THE INTENT IS. SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING OVER EACH OTHER. BAKER MELINDA'S. YES MY CLOSE KNIT FLITS THANK YOU MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN DAHLE OTHERS WHO TESTIFIED TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL WASN'T CRAFTED OUT OF THIN AIR I DIDN'T JUST COME UP WITH THIS- JUST OUT OF THE BLUE AT NIGHT THIS BILL. THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN DAY WAS CRAFTED WITH THE HELP OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HE SAID THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE WORDED SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO INORDER TO GET THESE DRUG DEALERS OFF THE STREET THAT IS WHY IT IS WORDED THE WAY IT IS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT- IMPLIED MALICE. IS NOT. EIGHT IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA OKAY HI MALICE IN DRUG RELATED DEATHS IS NOT A NEW IDEA TWENTY STATES. NOW HAVE DRUG INDUCED HOMICIDE LAWS SECURING THE SAME SENTENCES AS MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER IN THERE ARE MORE STATES THAT ARE CONSIDERING IT. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT THE OPPOSITION MADE- THIS IS NOT A MANDATORY MURDER CHARGE. THIS IS AN ADVISEMENT A WARNING YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE THE NEXT TIME. IF YOU CONTINUE THIS BEHAVIOR IN YOUR BEHAVIOR CAUSES SOMEONE TO DIE YOU COULD BE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE D. A. IT IS TO BE USED WITH DISCRETION JUST LIKE IT IS. WHAT DO YOU AYE CASES. IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED EVERY TIME WE HAVE SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF YOU AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THE FRIEND WHO GIVES SOMEONE A PILL THE LOW LEVEL DEALER WE'RE TALKING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WANT TO GO AFTER THE BIG GUYS OKAY. THE MASS DISTRIBUTORS THAT'S WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING AFTER EVERY TINY LITTLE LOW LEVEL DRUG DEALERS THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. THERE WAS A WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION THAT MADE THE CLAIM THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD IT NOW- REFUSED TO CALL NINE ONE ONE IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEBODY WAS HAVING AN ISSUE. AT WHAT THAT IS A RIDICULOUS CLAIM THAT IT WE HAVE GOOD SAMARITAN LAWS FOR LOTS OF THINGS IN CALIFORNIA OF SOMEONE. I MEAN IF SOMEONE GETS IN A CAR ACCIDENT ARE THEY GONNA NOW SAY- I'M NOT GOING TO CALL NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE MAYBE THEY'LL BLAME ME FOR THE CART THAT'S RIDICULOUS THAT IS ABSURD ON ITS FACE AND BY THE WAY. THE GOOD SAMARITAN LAWS ARE IN PLACE FOR EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF REASON SO THAT SOMEONE CAN MAKE THE PHONE CALL THE SAME SOMEONE'S LIFE AND NO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CHARGED. SAID THAT'S JUST. THAT'S JUST FLAT OUT FALSE. M. DRUG DEALERS DO YOU HAVE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THOUGH TO PACK FENTANYL INTO THESE PILLS DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN PERCOCET THEY'RE PUTTING THEM AN OXY THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN ADDERALL OKAY THIS GOES DOWN TO MIDDLE SCHOOL. FOURTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS WERE TALKING FOURTEEN YOUR KIDS AND YOU GET ON SNAPCHAT AND YOU CAN ORDER IT I MEAN COME ON. COME ON. THEY DO IT BECAUSE IT'S FINANCIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS WE ALL KNOW THAT. THE POSSIBILITY OF POSSIBLY BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER FOR ENGAGING IN THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY. THAT MIGHT BE PERHAPS ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO GET AT LEAST SOME OF THEM I'D OF DEALING DRUGS THAT ARE LACED WITH WITH FENNEL I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER I KNOW IT'S NOT AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED MORE- SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ADDICTION. AND I HAVE VOTED FOR BILLS THAT DO JUST THAT I HAVE DONE THAT I RECOGNIZE THAT. THE ANSWER ISN'T TO ALWAYS THROW SOMEONE IN PRISON BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ADDICTION. THE BETTER ANSWER IS. TO GET THEIR LIFE BACK ON TRACK I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I'VE AGREED WITH ALL OF YOU ON THAT AND I VOTED FOR THOSE TYPES. OF BILLS BUT THIS HAS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP. THE ENFORCING AND REHABILITATION SERVICES IT'S NOT JUST ONE TOOL IN THE TOOL. AND JUST ONE BIG. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WEEK. WE CAN HELP. IT WE CAN'T HELP EVERYONE WITH WITH THE SAME TOOLS YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE CASUAL USER THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD IN MIDDLE SCHOOL HIS FRIEND TELLS THEM- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT FINALS COMING UP AND I TOOK THIS LIFESAVING REALLY HELP ME FOCUS AND STAY AWAKE HERE TAKE THIS OUT OF ROLAND AND THE FOURTEEN OR TAKES IT AND HE GETS THE ONE WITH FEDERAL AND IT. THAT FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DOESN'T NEED TO GO TO REHABILITATION HE DOESN'T HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM HE TOOK AT ONE TIME. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY BUT I JUST. I FEEL LIKE IT'S IT WAS A NARROW VIEW TODAY OF HOW WE TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT YOU ALL DID HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK THROUGH THIS BOOK I KNOW SENATOR WIENER YOU SAID I BELIEVE IT IS YOU SAID YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK THERE I HOPE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK THROUGH IT- BECAUSE- AGAIN. THE IT'S JUST IT DOESN'T KNOW ANY RACIAL BOUNDARIES IT DOESN'T NO AGE LIMIT NOTHING. BUT ONE PILL A PILL IN SOME CASES. AND THAT'S IT YOU DON'T WAKE UP. I KNOW WE WERE DIRECTORS HEARING UP- SO I WILL JUST SAY. THEN I AM THANKFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY- I KNOW IT'S HARD.
