DAILY BASIS. THE RECORDS OF

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.618
THESE PRIVATE MOMENTS WERE AN

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:42.754
OBSCENE AND ILLEGAL INTRUSION

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.756
INTO DR KING'S LIFE AND SHOULD

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:48.059
NOT NEVER. BE MADE PUBLIC. AND

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.228
NOT USE FOR STUFF LIKE A

00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:52.130
SCANDAL. THIS IS WHY THIS

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:53.798
RESOLUTION NOT ONLY CALLS FOR

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.500

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.306
SIMILAR ABUSES. THIS RESOLUTION

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:03.174

JUST KIND OF LANDING ON THE

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.928
THOUGHT THAT THE U. S.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.930
CONSTITUTION GIVES ALL OF US US

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:00.832

WITHOUT WARRANT OR WITHOUT

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:08.740
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE FBI

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:10.942
ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY. IN THESE

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:14.445
SITUATIONS AND- I SUPPORT IS J.

YOU KNOW THESE TAPES SHOULD BE

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:32.297

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.299
RELEASED- THEY CERTAINLY

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:36.234
DOCUMENT THE SURVEILLANCE AND

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:39.070
HARASSMENT OF DR KING- AND THE

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.605
IDEA BEHIND RELEASING THEM IS

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.941
REALLY TO SULLY THE NAME AND

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.577
LEGACY OF AN AMERICAN ICON. IF

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:46.811
YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK DEEPLY

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:49.414
INTO THE PAST I THINK IT WOULD

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.683
MAKE SENSE TO LOOK DEEPER. INTO

00:30:51.749 --> 00:30:53.284
THE CHARACTER OF J. EDGAR

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.253
HOOVER WHO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.691
ABOVE THE LAW. AND IN FACT-

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.826
THIS PART OF OUR HISTORY AS A

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:04.429
CAUTIONARY TALE FOR SO MANY.

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:10.168
ABOUT PRIVACY POWER AND AFFIX.

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:11.903
WE WOULD DO OURSELVES A

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.772
DISSERVICE TO GO BACK AND

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.407
EXAMINE THE PAST THAT WE CANNOT

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:19.911
CHANGE. WHY IS SOMEONE'S

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:21.012
PERSONAL LIFE OR THEIR

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.947
FRAILTIES OF ANY IMPORTANCE

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.315
WHAT DOES THIS ADD TO THE

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.050
DISCUSSIONS WE'RE HAVING ABOUT

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:28.419
OUR FUTURE THE RELEASE OF THESE

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:31.256
TAPES IS NOT ABOUT ART IT'S NOT

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:33.258
ABOUT CONTEXTUAL AS ASIAN. IT

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:35.994
IS REALLY JUST SALACIOUS AND

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.896
PERNICIOUS AND AN ATTEMPT TO

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:42.066
DENIGRATE SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:43.735
REALLY SO MANY OF US COULD

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:46.237
CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE CIVIL

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:48.172
RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. AND

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:50.208
THERE WOULD BE NO GREATER HARM

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:52.443
THAN TO RELEASE THESE TAPES I

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.346
ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AND VOTE

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:58.016

SUPPORT OF ESTATE J. R. SEVEN

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.024
AND I THINK THE- MY COLLEAGUE

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.959
FROM GARDENA FOR- HIS ELOQUENT

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:10.995
REMARKS ABOUT- THE HISTORICAL

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:14.866
OF. LEGACY IN THE HISTORICAL

00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:16.634
PRESENCE OF DR MARTIN LUTHER

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.469
KING. I ALSO THINK IT'S

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:19.971
APPALLING THAT THE FBI IN ANY

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.172
SITUATION WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:23.341
LISTEN TO AN AMERICAN- ANY

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:25.476
AMERICANS PERSONAL

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:28.112
CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:28.780
GOING THROUGH ANY PROPER

00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:30.815
PROCESS. AND I THINK THE PROPER

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.216
PROCESS HAS BEEN DAMAGED SO

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:34.252
MUCH IN THE PAST THAT- IT WOULD

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:37.855
BE HARD TO. SAY THAT YOU COULD

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:40.658
ACTUALLY DO IT- TO ME IT

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.727
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BLACK

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.797
WHITE IN JABI LATINO ASIAN. OR

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:48.032
ANY OTHER RACE THE UNITED

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.901
STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:51.302
SPYING ON OR LISTENING TO

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:54.172
CONVERSATIONS- THAT TAKE PLACE

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:56.307
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. AND LIKE

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.642
I SAID EARLIER IT'S APPALLING

00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:59.243
THAT THE FBI WOULD HAVE DONE SO

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.879
TO MARTIN LUTHER KING. A JUNIOR

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:05.249
I DO- I DO THINK THAT AND THE

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:06.384
FOURTH AMENDMENT I DO KNOW THAT

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:07.485
THE FOURTH MEMO WAS PUT IN

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.187
PLACE TO PROTECT US AND EVERY

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:10.621
AMERICAN CITIZEN FROM.

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:13.391
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS AND- I

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.760
WOULD HOPE THAT REGARDLESS OF

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.861
WHO THAT UNITED STATES CITIZEN

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.864
IS- THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:22.300
TO ANYONE. IN THIS IN THE

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.835

CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THINGS LIKE

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:33.311
THIS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.879

INTERESTINGLY THOSE WERE

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.816
PROBABLY THE PERFECT

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:51.821
CHARACTERISTICS FOR SOMEBODY.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:52.422
THAT WAS A TRAILBLAZER. I AS

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:53.389
SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW. IT WAS

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:57.160
HARD. TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENED

WAS. IS HE WAS APPOINTED. AND

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.067
IT COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.235
SENATE AND PRESIDENT CLINTON

HAD TO DO A RECESS APPOINTMENT.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.307
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THE

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.875
INTERESTING THING WAS IS THERE

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:16.913
WAS A DEBATE. WHICH SEEMS. SO

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.449
PREHISTORIC NOW. ABOUT WHETHER

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:21.584
HIS SPOUSE COULD COME WITH HIM

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.653

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.556

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.158
EVEN LIVE OR BE SEEN IN THE

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:37.266
CENTURY AGO. AND YET. IT WAS

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.702
HIS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.871
THAT FOR THE RESPONSE WHERE

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.806
WHICH IS THE REASON THAT THEY

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:46.075

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:46.542
SOMEBODY TO BE SUCH A

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:49.512
TRAILBLAZER. SO I THINK HE WILL

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.348
GO DOWN IN HISTORY AND TO THE

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.650

ABOUT NOT LEAVING COMMUNITIES

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.234
