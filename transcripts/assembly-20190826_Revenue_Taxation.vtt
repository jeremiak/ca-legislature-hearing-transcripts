BABY BIT. I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES

IS THE FIRST SHE PARTICULAR

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:58.303
WHEN I WAS IN MARIN COUNTY

TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES. AND TO

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.441
CUT THEIR WEEKS. AND THE

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.743
REALITY IS THAT THAT WAS A VERY

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.978
DIFFICULT TASK TO HAVE

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:09.080

WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. SO THE

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:20.558
INCENTIVE CONCERTS CONCEPT

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.960
ABOUT DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO DEAL

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:23.495

HONEY. CATCHING WITH VINEGAR

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.564
REALLY IS KIND OF APPROPRIATE

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.366
IN THIS AREA. IN THE BOTTOM

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.668
LINE IS IF YOU HARDEN YOUR HOME

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:33.371
AND YOU. TAKE CARE OF YOUR FUEL

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.140

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.682
WE'RE NOT VERY PROUD OF. WE

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.084

EXPENSIVE TO HARD YOUR HOME AND

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.597
THE BOTTOM LINE IS A LOT OF

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:04.702
PEOPLE. JUST DON'T DO IT

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:05.336

ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.538
OF NOT ONLY ADOPTING DEFENSIBLE

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:41.372
SPACE ORDINANCES BUT AND

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:42.473
FORCING THEM I THINK IS THE

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.142
CHIEF BIG EXPLAIN JUST A MOMENT

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.344
AGO JUST HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS.

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:48.947
SO WE SEE SB TWO NINETY FIVE IS

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.348
AN APPROPRIATE TOOL TO GET SOME

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.650
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR. THOSE

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.052
INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY THOSE

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.254
OF LOWER INCOME. AND DO NOT

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.889
HAVE OBVIOUSLY THE CASH FLOW OR

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:59.524
THE UP FRONT MONIES TO DO THIS

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:02.126
TYPE OF WORK WE SEE THIS BILL

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.161
AS A VERY KEY PART OF THAT

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:05.763
CONVERSATION. AND AGAIN. AND

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.366
MANY OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES THE

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.701
INCOME LEVEL IS JUST SO

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:12.036
DIFFICULT AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.271
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL WE

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:14.706
URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASSES

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:15.974

ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.361
UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION I

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:11.562
DO WANT TO SAY WE ARE VERY

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:13.431
APPRECIATIVE WITH THE MANY

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:15.600
ASPECTS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.502
MEASURE REGARDING SEND SIX SIX

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.203
CETERA THAT WE'VE BEEN ADDED

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.371
VACATING FOR WHILE ALSO WANT TO

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.707

ARE VERY MUCH DO APPRECIATE IT

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.046
THE REASON WE SUPPORT DON'T

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:30.181
SUPPORT THE MEASURE IS THAT IT

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:32.917
WOULD POTENTIALLY CUT UP TO ONE

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.152
POINT TWO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:35.386
FROM OUR SCHOOLS.MONEY THAT

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.454
WOULD HAVE GONE TO KIDS THE

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.589
NEXT THREE YEARS SO WE DO VERY

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.091
MUCH TO BELIEVE SOMETHING NEEDS

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.160
TO BE DONE IF IT'S THE PRIORITY

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.628
ON THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.196
BELIEVES THAT IT IS THEN WE

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:47.165
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT OTHER

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:49.200
TAX CREDITS OR OTHER ITEMS THAT

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.768
ARE OUT THERE AND THAT MIGHT

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:52.937
NOT GIVE YOU THE SAME RETURN ON

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:55.139
INVESTMENT IN THE SAME BENEFIT

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:56.574
TO CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND WE

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:57.809
WOULD ASK YOU TO USE AN

00:32:57.875 --> 00:33:00.278
ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FUNDING.

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.547
FOR AN EXAMPLE THIS WOULD ALSO

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:04.382
HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SCHOOL

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.350
DISTRICTS ARE IN HIGH HIGH

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:06.784
PRONE FIRE AREAS OF AS WELL I

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:09.020
SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:09.821
TIME THIS YEAR ADVOCATING TO

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:15.660
GET IT A THIRD YOU. ARE EIGHTY

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:16.160
A FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS IN

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:20.565
PARADISE. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.699
AMOUNT OF TIME ON THAT AND WE

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:22.734
THINK THEY EVEN THE THREE YEARS

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.334
ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.869
PARADISE TO. BUILD BECAUSE THEY

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:25.970
CAN EVEN REBUILD OUR SCHOOLS

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.205
COMPREHENSIVELY. UNTIL IT

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:28.272
COUNTY KIDS ALL THE MYRIAD OF

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.374
FOUNDATIONAL SUPPORTS AND

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.141
SERVICES TAKING CARE OF SO WE

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.476
IN THE- SCHOOL SYSTEM ARE ALSO.

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:32.810
HAVING TO SUFFER FROM THE

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:35.046
RESULT OF WILDFIRES BUT WE

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.881
BELIEVE THAT TAKING RESOURCES

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.516
AWAY FROM SCHOOLS. THEY NEED TO

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:41.319
ACTUALLY. PROVIDE SERVICES TO

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.789
KIDS AND BUILD OUR OWN-FACILITIES SO WE CAN WITHSTAND

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:47.158
FIRE OR ALSO ISSUES THAT NEED

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.993
TO BE ADDRESSED SO. WITH THIS

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.161
IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND WE

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.096
ARE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT BUT WE

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.564
DO ASK THAT SCHOOLS ARE NOT

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:56.501
HARMED IN THE PROCESS OF THESE

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:59.804
LONG TERM SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS.

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:00.304
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:04.142
OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:04.609
AND QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:07.211
COMMITTEE TALKED QUIRK. SO I

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:11.048
HAVE A COUPLE PROBLEMS ONE IS.

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:12.316
AT LEAST AT THE TIME OF THE

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.252
WRITING OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.120
MAY HAVE CHANGED IT'S NOT A

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.556
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT WHICH

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.792
MEANS THE 50% OF PEOPLE IN THE

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:22.927
STATE WHO DON'T PAY STATE TAXES

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:24.295
GET NO BENEFIT. THESE ARE ALSO

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:29.033
LOWER INCOME. AND I REALIZE

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.435
THIS WOULD ALSO MAKE THE BILL

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.337
MORE EXPENSIVE BUT PERHAPS YOU

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:38.509
HAVE TO THEN LOWER THE. THREE

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:39.477
INCOME LEVELS IT WHICH YOU

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.145
TOGETHER BENEFIT BUT FRANKLY

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:43.981
THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD ARE

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:45.349
THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY STATE

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:49.954
TAXES ARE BECAUSE OF BEING OF

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:50.922
LOW INCOME AND THESE ARE THE

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.557
ONES WHO NEED THE HELP THE MOST

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:54.625
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:56.127
THAT ANY REFLECTIONS ON WHAT

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:58.229
YOU MIGHT DO. NO THANK YOU SO

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.230
MUCH AS AN EVER AT THROUGH THE

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:00.731
CHAIR AT SOME MEMBER QUIRK

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:02.667
BRINGS UP A REALLY GOOD POINT

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.535
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:07.705
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOW INCOME

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.907
OR ON FIXED INCOME IS WELL AS

00:35:09.974 --> 00:35:12.276
THOSE WHO ARE MIDDLE CLASS. WE

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:14.779
DID NOT FOCUS ON THE LOW INCOME

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:16.314
OR THOSE SENIORS WHO ARE ON

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.816
FIXED INCOME TWO REASONS ONE

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:20.485
ASSUME NUMBER WOULD HAS A

00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:23.521
REALLY GREAT BILL THAT IS HAS

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:25.923
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IT'S A

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.325
ONE BILLION DOLLAR REVOLVING

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:30.161
LOAN FUND THAT WOULD BE FOCUS

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:33.030
ON THOSE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:37.268
THAT ARE LIVING WITHIN. HI FIRE

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:41.405
HAZARD SEVERITY SOUNDS. SENATOR

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.807
RUBIO ALSO HAS A MEASURE THAT'S

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:43.941
BEEN FOCUS ON LOW INCOME AND

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:44.509
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON FIXED

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:47.945
INCOMES. THE INDIVIDUAL

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:50.982
HOMEOWNERS BETWEEN SEVENTY

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:51.516
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:52.116
FORTY THOUSAND YEAR WOULD NOT

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:54.452
BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:55.653
REVOLVING LOAN FUND OR CENTER

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.290
RUBIO IS LEGISLATION. AND WHAT

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.225
WE KNOW IS THE MAJORITY OF

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:04.395
HOMES WITH IN THAT HI FIRE

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.330
HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS THOSE

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.332
VERY ZONES OUR MIDDLE INCOME.

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:08.900
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ADVANCING

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:12.537
THE TAX CREDIT. I WOULD ALSO

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:15.540
LIKE TO SAY THIS HAS TO BE PART

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.441
OF A LARGER PICTURE. AND YOU'RE

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.610
GONNA SEE ADDITIONAL PIECES OF

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:20.144
LEGISLATION ON TO WEATHER

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:23.915
FRONTS. NUMBER ONE WE NEED TO

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.349
TAKE A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.284
ABOUT HOW WE'RE MAKING

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.552
INVESTMENTS WHETHER IT'S THE

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:29.020
REVOLVING LOAN FUND IS A MEMBER

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:31.589
WOOD OR TAX CREDIT WHICH MEANS

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.591
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.293
DEPARTMENT INSURANCE IS

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:35.927
GETTING. THE DATE EVERY YEAR ON

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:39.664
NON RENEWALS. THEY DON'T

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.798
INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T.

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.334
DON'T CURRENTLY. HAVE A MANDATE

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.502
TO BE TO PROVIDE THE NON

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.003
RENEWAL INFORMATION ON ANNUAL

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.905
BASIS TO THE PART INSURANCE. WE

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:51.208
BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE A MUST.

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:51.809
THAT WAY WE'RE ABLE TO FIGURE

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:54.579
OUT WHICH AREAS OF THE STATE.

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:55.079
ARE LOSING INSURANCE THE

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:58.683
FASTEST. THEN YOU HAVE TO BE

00:36:58.749 --> 00:36:59.483
ABLE TO ADVANCE REVOLVING LOAN

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.118
FUND AND TAX CREDITS TO BE TO

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:01.686
TAKE CARE NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.988
COMMUNITY. DOING ONE HOUSE AT

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.890
IT I WILL NOT MAKE OF COMMUNITY

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.325
MORE FIRE SAFE IT'S TAKING

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:08.859
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS AN ENTIRE

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.695
COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE TO DO

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:13.097
THAT WITH DATA WHICH WE DON'T

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:16.067
CURRENTLY HAVE. IN ADDITION

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:16.634
YOU'RE GONNA SEE LEGISLATION

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.135
THAT WILL BE AN- THAT FOCUS ON

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.704
TRUNCATING THE TIME. FOR CODE

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.339
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHEN IT

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.406
COMES A FIRE SAFETY AND PRIVATE

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.742
AND PUBLIC PROPERTY. I'M IT

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.744
COULD BE SIX MONTHS TO TWO

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:27.445
YEARS TO BE A TO MITIGATE A

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:30.114
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.682
WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE RISK

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:35.019
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WE ALSO NEED

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:35.519
TO GET CODE ENFORCEMENT

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.488
OFFICERS AND FIRE MARSHALS. THE

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.624
TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.627
PUT SOME SUGAR ON THE TABLE TO

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:43.194
ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.230
FIRE STATE. SO THAT IS WHY. WE

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:47.732
DID NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:48.366
ENTER INTO THE SPACE OF THE SIM

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:49.000
NUMBER WOULDN'T BECAUSE HE HAS

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:49.867
A WONDERFUL PLAN. AND WE FULLY

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.836
SUPPORT THAT. AND WHAT WE ALSO

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:52.937
KNOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:54.305
LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.007
CALIFORNIANS. IN TENS OF

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.174
THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT WOULD

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:59.176
NOT QUALIFY FOR THAT REVOLVING

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.745
LOAN FUND. AND THAT'S WHY YOU

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:03.014
SEE S. FOCUSING ON THAT AND

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.749
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALSO NEARING

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:07.718
IT DOWN. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:08.319
BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE ISSUE OF

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:12.556
LOCKS TAX REVENUE. I'LL SAY IS

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.491
THAT. THE CITY AND ROSA CITY

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:14.091
SCHOOLS. I THEY'VE LOST SEVEN

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:16.127
HUNDRED STUDENTS SEVEN HUNDRED

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.094
AND OVER THREE THOUSAND FOLKS

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.462
OF LESSON ON THE COUNTY. OVER

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:19.830
THE LAST NEARLY TWENTY FOUR

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:21.465
MONTHS. WE HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.868
BE ABLE TO BACKFILL THEIR

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:27.772
GENERAL FUND. WE TAKE A LOOK AT

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:28.873
SOME OF THE LONGEST AND LARGEST

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:31.475
LOSSES OF TO OF PROPERTY TAX

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.210
IT'S WHEN THESE MASSIVE FIRES

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.512
WIPE OUT ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:37.415
IN ROLES. IN NASSAU WERE SEEN

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.083
SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAX.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.052
REDUCTIONS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:43.020
GENERATION IN CINEMA COUNTY TO

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.355
BE A TO GET BACK TO WHERE THEY

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.123
WERE IN THE CITY SANTA ROSA IT

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.426
MAY TAKE LONGER. IN THE COUNTY

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.960
OF LAKE AND THE REASON WHY I

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.429
BRING THAT UP IS THAT WE CAN'T

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:53.097
AFFORD NOT TO BE A TO BRING

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.232
THIS FORWARD WE NEED A

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:55.833
STRATEGIC APPROACH. MULTIPLE

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.135
TOOLS IN THE BELT AND THAT IS

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.003
WHY WE'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.671
AND IF WE CAN GIVE OVER TEN.

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:02.840
BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.842
TO CORPORATIONS IN THE STATE WE

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.178
SURE AS HELL CAN GIVE IT TO

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:09.313
HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS TO BE

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.314
TO MAKE THEIR FOR THEIR HOMES

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.283
FIRE SAFE I'M SORRY YEP DON

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.250
SOME NUMBER OF BUT IT. IS A

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:18.589
GREAT QUESTION REALLY THERE WAS.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:24.395
A GOOD ANSWER. MY CONCERN IS.

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:24.962
THE WAY THAT IS HIGH PRAISE

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.330
FROM HIM YEAH. MY CONCERN IS

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:27.531
NOW WE'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE LOW

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:28.399
INCOME TO GET A LOAN IF YOU

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:29.133
HAVE. HIGH INCOME YOU GET FREE

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.967
MONEY. AND THAT JUST DOESN'T

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.670
WORK FOR ME. YOU'RE TREATING

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.338
THE HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE BETTER

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:34.905
THAN YOUR TREATING THE LOWER

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:37.742
INCOME PEOPLE. THAT'S MY

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:40.311
CONCERN. I MEAN WE COULD

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.646
DEVELOP A LARGER LOAN PROGRAM

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.181
BUT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:45.950
THE EXPENSE OF THAT AN IMPACT

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.184
ON THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:49.186
EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT BUT AGAIN

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:51.622
IF THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:53.224
STEP UP AND STAND TALL FOR THE

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:53.791
LARGEST CORPORATIONS ON THE

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.259
PLANET. AND GIVE THEM TAX

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.694
BREAKS THEN WE BETTER IS HELD

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:58.429
STEP UP AND PROVIDE THEM FOR

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.797
HOMEOWNERS IN IN THE REASON WHY

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.966
I SAY THAT IS THAT THIS IS ONE

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:03.167
OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.369
INSURE FIRE SAFETY BUT I HEAR

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:07.104
YOU AND I RESPECT YOUR OPINION

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.372
AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:09.707
SMARTEST. INDIVIDUALS IN THE

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.475
LEGISLATURE I KNOW WE MAY

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:14.545
DISAGREE ON THIS BUT YEAH I

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:15.146
GREATLY RESPECT YOUR OPINION.

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:19.850
THANK YOU. MR GRAY. THANK YOU

SENATOR AGENCY. THE BILL THAT

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:28.793
YOU BROUGHT HERE TODAY AND MY

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:31.128
COMMENTS ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:32.129
TO THE MEASURE OF FORCE OF THAT

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:33.464
I THINK MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.867
SENSE TO GIVE SOME INCENTIVES

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.270
TO HARDEN AND REDUCE SOME OF

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:41.605
THIS RISK ON THE MACRO LEVEL

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.374
I'M WELL AWARE OF THE

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.643
DIFFICULTY AS RELATIONSHIP AND

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:48.179
SAYS I HAVE A PROPERTY WITH MY

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.580
FAMILY IN THE FOOTHILLS OF

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.182

DOLLARS YEAR FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.722
DOLLARS A YEAR IN ONE YEAR. SO

00:40:58.789 --> 00:40:59.456
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:02.326
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.394
OUR ARMS AROUND GOING FORWARD

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.563

EVERY COMMITTEE AND ON THE

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:20.010
FLOOR IS THERE SEEMS. TO BE OR

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:20.578
FEELS AS IF THERE'S A LITTLE

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:26.650
BIT OF A. FOR CALLING PARKS

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:29.553
EITHER PERHAPS SAY. A SENSE

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.788
THAT WE'RE GOING TO IGNORE SOME

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.022
OF THE CHALLENGES OF OTHER

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.556

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:34.825
CLIMATE CHANGE IS CREATING

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:36.527
PERHAPS A PROPENSITY FOR

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:38.529
INCREASES IN FIRE RISK WE'RE

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.330
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.265

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:48.973
CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.875
INCREASINGLY HOT CLIMATES.

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.176
HISTORICALLY WE'VE ALWAYS HAD

OUR CLIMATE JUST AS

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:55.412

INCREASES IN BOTH IT SEEMS LIKE

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.286
WE'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.754
THE ENERGY RATE INCREASES ON MY

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:05.990
CONSTITUENTS. SO IT'S LIKE

THE RISK AND THAT'S ALL PAY AND

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:13.063
LET'S ALL HELP OUT. BUT

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.098

WELL AS HOME HARDENING. THERE

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.252
ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:43.934
ESPECIALLY. THROUGHOUT THE

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:44.468
FIELD AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:49.606
MEANS. SO I REPLACE IN A ROOF

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.742
IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:54.178
BEING ABLE TO PUT A MANDATE ON

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.345
TO THEM AS A CODE ENFORCEMENT

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.147

BACKLOG. IS SIMPLY AREN'T

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:00.651
MOVING ON THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:01.852
BELIEVE THIS NEED TO BE PART OF

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:04.254
A LARGER PROGRAM NUMBER ONE WE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:06.523
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.325
MANDATED DATA TO THE APARTMENT

WE NEED TO BE A LOOK AT THE

COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE GREATEST

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:14.731
NUMBER OF NON RENEWALS WE DON'T

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.867
EVEN HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. THE

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:19.369
ONLY WAY WE CAN GO OFF OF WHERE

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:19.970
INSURANCE BEING LOSS IS GOING

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.039

TIMELINE S WE JUST HEARD FROM

YEARS. TO GET AN INDIVIDUAL TO

THE PROCESS. TO ACTUALLY

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:32.482
ENFORCE THE LAW. I BELIEVE THAT

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.984
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.185

THIS BILL I DO THINK THAT

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:14.925
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.326
HARDENED AND I THINK IN

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:17.661
COMPLEMENT WITH SOME OF THE

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:18.629
OTHER BILLS THAT ARE MOVING

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:19.763
THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH WE

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.765
DID REVIEW AS PART OF REVIEWING

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.133
YOUR MEASURE. I THINK IT'S

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.701
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE OF ALL

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:27.271
ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS ARE ABLE

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:29.373
TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES AND TO

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:31.041
THE OPPOSITION IN THIS ONE CASE

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:34.511
I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY I FEEL

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.847
DIFFERENTLY ON THIS ONE I WENT

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:37.748
TO SCHOOL IN PARADISE THERE WAS

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:39.483
ACTUALLY SAVED AS A RESULT OF

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:41.084
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.219
HARDENING AND THAT SCHOOL IN

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.687
THOSE STUDENTS. IT'S THE ONE

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.489
NORMAL THING THEY HAVE BECAUSE

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:46.657
THE PROPERTY WAS HARDENED AND

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:47.958
BECAUSE VEGETATION MANAGER WAS

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.593
DONE THEY GET TO STILL GO TO

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.927
SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND IT'S THE

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:51.895
ONE THING THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:54.197
RETURN TO REGULARLY AND THAT

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.499
WAS FROM THEIR PREVIOUS LIFE

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:56.233
AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.467
IMPORTANT SO I AGREE WITH YOU

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.202
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.203
NOT JUST THE HOMES ARE HARDENED

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.306
BUT THAT ALL THE IMPORTANT

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.308
PROPERTIES IN THE COMMUNITY OUR

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.776
OUR OUR CAT MAINTAINED AND KEPT

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:06.810
SAFE AND WHETHER THAT'S A

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.011
HOSPITAL OR A SCHOOL I AGREE

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.746
WITH YOU WE NEED TO EXTEND

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:11.481
THESE PROGRAMS TO THOSE FOLKS

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.116
AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT THE

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:14.184
DAMAGE AND THE LOSS FROM

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.619
PROPERTY TAXES FROM.

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.621
