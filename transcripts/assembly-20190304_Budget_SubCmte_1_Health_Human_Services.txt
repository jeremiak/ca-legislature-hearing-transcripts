SO THE CHEN US FOR US TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT AT THE BUDGET AS WELL AS TO PRESENT -- A COUPLE OF ITEMS -- ISSUE ITEM SO START WITH THE OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HIM HOSPITAL'S MANAGES THE LARGEST FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES WE PROVIDE DAILY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO OVER FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PATIENTS DAILY. SERVING OVER TWELVE THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNUALLY. WE HAVE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND WE OPERATE FIVE FREESTANDING HOSPITALS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE SERVE SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMITMENTS WE SERVE THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THE NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS. MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS WHO COME TO US FROM CDC ARE. WE HAVE THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS AND THEN WE ALSO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CIVILLY COMMITTED TO US UNDER THE LAND FROM AND PATRICK SHORT ACT. LAST YEAR 89% OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE TREATED CAME TO US AS FRIENDS A COMMITMENTS. AND THEY COME TO US FROM EITHER THE CRIMINAL COURTS OR FROM CDC ARE 11% OF OUR POPULATION WAS FROM THE COUNTY IS UNDER THE WINTER IN PETRA SHORT ACT. IN ADDITION TO THE TREATMENT THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE STATE HOSPITALS WE ALSO OPERATE COMMUNITY BASED IN JAIL BASED PROGRAMS. THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES FOR WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAMS THESE ARE DESIGNED PATIENTS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT UNDER FRIENDS A COMMITMENTS. BACK TO THE COMMUNITY WE PROVIDE COMMUNITY TRICK MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PATIENTS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH WITH THE RESPECT TOWARD JAIL BASS COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE PROVIDE RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY SERVICES IN THE JAIL SETTINGS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DECLARED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. THESE ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS FOR LIKELY TO RESTORE WITHIN SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BEDS IN TEN COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IN THIS YEAR WE ACTIVATED A NEW PROGRAM WHICH IS THE LOS ANGELES CAN COUNTY COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND RE ENTRY. THIS IS FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEDS IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINETY TWO BEDS FILLED OUT SOME THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. WITH RESPECT TO THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED BUDGET IS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF THIRTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION OVER THE CURRENT YEAR. THE TOTAL POSITIONS PROPOSED IN NINETEEN TWENTY AS TWELVE MILLION TWELVE MILLION TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE POINT. SIX AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT A PROJECTED DAILY CENSUS BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY OF SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN IN THE STATE HOSPITALS. FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE AND OUR JOB BASE PROGRAMS SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE IN THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAMS AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM. SO THE AGENDA SPECIFICALLY ASSETS PRESENT ON THREE ISSUE ITEMS AND THEN ALSO HOUSE FOR US TO COVER ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WERE NOT LISTED ELSE FROM THE AGENDA SO IN ADDITION TO THE THREE THAT WERE LISTED. ALSO TOUCH ON THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM FOR NON SB PEAS -- COMMITMENTS AND THEN OUR CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST ITEM WHICH IS THE PATIENT DRIVEN OPERATING EXPENSE AND EQUIPMENT WERE REQUESTING TEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING CARE AND TREATMENT IN OUR FOR OUR PATIENTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS CENTS A CENSUS AND THAT THREE NINETEEN TWENTY WE EXPECT THAT IN THAT INCREASE TO BE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THIS INCREASE IN SAYS CENSUS RESULTS OF ALL THE HAD ACROSS THE STATE OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS. FOR THESE BAD ACTIVATIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE BROUGHT FOR LAST YEAR FROM METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL WE ONLY RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THE STAFFING AND THE STAFF ASSOCIATED -- ANY BUT WE DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDING FOR THE PATIENT RELATED OFF -- ANY EXPENSES THESE ARE THINGS LIKE LAUNDRY PHARMACEUTICALS LAB SUPPLIES OUTSIDE MEDICAL COSTS THE FOOD THE CLOTHING -- EVERYTHING IT TAKES FOR US TO PROVIDE FOR THE PATIENTS. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PATIENT DRIVEN -- ANY COSTS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM IS ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS PER PATIENT WHICH IS IT REPRESENTS AN 18% INCREASE IN THIS COSTA CROSS THE PAST SIX YEARS. AND THESE INCREASES IN PRICE HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COST OF PHARMACEUTICALS AS WELL AS I'M OUTSIDE HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE TEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WE'VE CLASS -- IT JUST FOR THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED FOR THE INCREASE CENSUS -- IN THE IN THE PRINT -- PROJECTED CENSUS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN SUB TRACKS OUT WHAT WE ALREADY RECEIVED -- FOR FOR THE METROPOLITAN -- EXPANSION I LAST YEAR BOARD BASIS WE DO PLAN TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON A PATIENT REVENUE ANY EXPENSES AND THAT AND I GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND A REVISION ESTIMATES. THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS -- FOR THE ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM AND WE ANTICIPATE A SAVINGS OF ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY WITH A REDUCTION OF TWELVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS WITHIN THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELAY AND OUR FOURTH ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM UNIT. WHICH WILL BE LOCATED AT PATTON. I'M JUST AS A BRIEF BACKGROUND AB THIRTEEN FORTY SO -- STATUTES OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE IN ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. AND THIS WAS TO TREAT PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS -- BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR MORE INTENSIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM AND A HIGHER SECURITY SETTING IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO TREAT THIS PAIN THESE PATIENTS. AND RETURN THEM TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. IN PREVIOUS BUDGET AX WE'RE PROOF FOR THE CONSTRUCTION FOR FOUR UNITS THREE AT ATASCADERO THEY WERE THIRTEEN BAD UNIT SEND ONE OUT PATTON WHICH IS A TEN BED UNIT. AND THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AX WE RECEIVED APPROVAL ON FUNDING FOR THE POSITIONS AND I'M TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN ACTIVATING THESE ONCE THE CONSTRUCTION -- IS COMPLETED ON THESE UNITS. AND THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT -- THAT REPRESENTING TODAY REFLECTS A CHANGE IN THE DATE OF THE ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION FOR THE PATENT ATP UNIT -- THIS IS MOVING IT FROM SEPTEMBER TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS AS A RESULT OF LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TIME LINES TIME TO EVERY SEVE STATE FIRE MARSHAL PROVE ALL I MOST OF IT TIME. WE HAD A AND AB WHO IS DUE TO THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL RESPONDING TO THAT FIRE INCIDENTS THIS PAST YEAR AS WELL AS SOME. CHALLENGES THAT THE CONTRACTOR HAD TO RESPONDING AND UPDATING PLANS AND RESPOND TO SOME OF THE FIRE MARSHAL COMMONS. SO THE THAT PLANTS HAVE BEEN ULTIMATELY APPROVED THEY WERE APPROVED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND THAT PROJECT IS CURRENTLY OUT TO BED. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE MANAGEMENT PETROUS SHORT -- POPULATION SERVICES ADJUSTMENT AND THIS IS TO INCREASE OUR REIMBURSEMENT THIRD AT THE ALREADY BY SIX HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING OUR CURRENT APPROVED AUTHORITY IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND COUNTIES REIMBURSED ON THE DEPARTMENT A DAILY BED RATE FOR THEIR OF PATIENTS THAT WE TREAT UNDER THE LAND FROM IN PETRA SHORT ACT AS WELL AS ANY -- INDIVIDUALS THAT WE TREAT AS MISDEMEANOR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS. AND BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED SENSES AND FOR THE LPS AND AM A MISDEMEANOR AND I. S. TEENS -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WE DON'T WE AT CENTS. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM -- THIS IS A MILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER THEY WERE REQUESTING IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT OUR CONTRACTED CASELOAD OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX CLIENTS IN THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM. THE CONDITIONALLY A CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM IS OUR SYSTEM WIDE SYSTEM OUR SYSTEM WIDE SYSTEM OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN APPROVED. BY THE COURT INTO COMMUNITY OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. AND THIS A PROGRAM SERVICES THE NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY PATIENTS MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. WHEN A COURT -- ORDERS A PATIENT OUT TO CONDITIONAL RELEASE THERE IS A COURT APPROVED TREATMENT PLAN AND THE INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE A WIDE RATED RIGHT ARRAY OF SERVICES NEEDED TO SUPPORT THEIR INTEGRATION INTO THE COMMUNITY. WHEN A PATIENT IS DISRUPTED CHARGE INTO CONRAD THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT LIVING AND MARK OUR ENVIRONMENT IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE OUT POSSIBLE SETTING? THE FUNDS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING TODAY ARE TO SUPPORT INCREASE HOUSING COSTS FOR OUR CONDITIONAL RELEASE -- CLIENTS WE PAY UP TO A 100% OF THE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED BY THE CONTENT PROVIDERS TO DELIVER TREATMENT SUPERVISION AND HOUSING TO CONRAD. WELL MOST OF OUR CONRAD CLIENTS DO QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS -- THAT DO OFFSET THESE COSTS WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT COST -- IN THE INCREASING COST ZING FOR THESE PATIENTS MOSTLY BECAUSE THE HOUSING MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA AND RENTAL MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SIX SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. OF THE FINAL ITEM IN THIS -- ISSUE IS THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM FOR SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS AND THIS WE ARE -- BECAUSE WE ARE ANTICIPATING INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND FISCAL YEAR. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT AN ANTICIPATED INCREASING CASELOAD. FOR THE FOR FOR FOR SB PEAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDING TWO TRANSIENT RELEASES AND THIS WOULD THEN MAKE IT A TOTAL TWENTY ONE SB PEAS CONDITIONALLY RELEASED IN THE COMMUNITY BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN WE'RE REQUESTING TWO POINT ONE MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL TWO SB PIECE THAT OUR SIM TO BE RELEASED NEXT YEAR. FOR TOTAL CONRAD CASELOAD OF TWENTY THREE A BY A JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE ITEMS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR I MAY START BY ESTABLISHING FORM ARAMBULA. YOUR FRAZIER. MATHIS PATTERSON [inaudible] RAMOS [inaudible] RUBIO [inaudible] WHAT? HELLO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WANT TO BURN PLANTS THAT WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO BACK IN THE EIGHTIES HOW MANY -- STATE HOSPITALS DID WE HAVE THAT TIME -- THAT PREDATES ME. ANYBODY IN THE I ANSWER THEM. I KNOW THAT [inaudible] SEC. BY THE RESULT OF EXISTING FIVE IN THE EIGHTIES. SO HOW MANY IN THE PSYCH PROGRAM WERE A DISMISSED. SO WE HAD AND THREE PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATED FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND THOSE THREE TO ABOUT PROGRAMS WERE TRANSFERRED AT THE BEGINNING OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BACK TO CDC ARE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT CAPACITY AND WE LOOK. PROGRAMMING OUT SOME OF THE LIKE. TWELVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IT LOOKS LIKE. FROM YOUR WE SERVE A TWELVE THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNUALLY AND HAVE -- IS A CENSUS OF ABOUT FIFTY HOSPITALS DAILY. SO HOW MUCH OF ITS CONTRACTED OUT FROM THE STATE HOSPITALS -- THAT CONTRACTED SERVICES ARE AROUND. TO THAT DATA HERE. IT IS A LITTLE OVER A THOUSAND OKAY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M LOOKING AT IS WE KEEP DIMINISHING SERVICES BUT WE CONTRACT OUT MORE. AND SO. IT THE EQUITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS TRYING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A UP. CONSISTENT AMOUNT OF CARE IS THIS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A LACY -- THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR WHAT IS THE DEFAULT TO THE PRISON SYSTEM. THAT THAT TWEENER -- GOING FORWARD HE MENTIONED HOW MUCH PER PATIENT AS YOUR CLASSES. ANNOUNCES THAT -- NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FIGURE WAS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH JUST THE PATIENT DRIVEN -- ANY THE COST OF YOUR TOTAL BURDEN THE TOTAL COST AN AVERAGE IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GIVE OR TAKE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER INDIVIDUAL PER INDIVIDUAL OVER HERE. SO. WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR CONTRACTING OUT? THE CONTRACTING OUT BERRIES -- THE HOW INDEPENDENT FINANCE FOR THE GOP ASIAN ON AVERAGE IS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH MUCH SLOWER. OKAY. SO WHAT I'M SEEING IS YOUR AND WHAT I'M HEARING IN THE PUBLIC IS THAT. THE STAFFING. AS FAR UNDERSERVED WHERE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR MANAGING OVERTIME IN AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC. THIS COMING OUT AND WHEN WE ARE CONTRACTING UP WE'RE MAKING STATE EMPLOYEES WORK OVERTIME -- TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS IN THIS COMING BUDGET -- SPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE INDIVIDUALS ON BOTH SIDES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROUTE AND JUST A COMMENT AND THANK YOU -- I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE INFORMATION EARLIER AND I VISITED ACTUALLY VISITED DON KNAPP THE STATE HOSPITAL LAST YEAR AND FIRST AND FOREMOST -- SO MANY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BUT PRIMARILY I THINK THE SAFETY OF THE THE PERSONNEL IS MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN WHEN I WAS THERE IT WAS JUST -- OVERWHELMING IF YOU WELL TO SEE WHAT THE EMPLOYEES -- GO TO ON A DAILY BASES ESPECIALLY WITH THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT -- THAT YOU ALL SURVIVE WITH BASICALLY AND I WANT TO JUST LIKE TO KNOW THAT I DO SUPPORT. THE INCREASE AT MY FEAR IS AGAIN THAT ON SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT -- BEING TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING AND SELL I AGAIN I WANT TO JUST TELL THE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT -- WHAT YOU GUYS DO IS INCREDIBLE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE EXPENSES HUGE BITE? I THINK THAT -- IF. IN NOT HELPING SOME OF THESE FOLKS -- ACTUALLY BE REHABILITATED CREEK. I DON'T SEE A DECREASE AND IN POPULATION AND SO AGAIN IT'S JUST A COMMENT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE VISIT -- LAST YEAR AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU NEED MORE FUNDING. IF YOU NEED ANY HELP OR ANYTHING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO ME PLEASE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND SEE. IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT I CAN HELP -- HELP OUT MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN I WILL JUST MAKE A COMMENT THAT -- THE STATUE THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS BUT MANY OF US WANTED THOSE ATP'S. TO HELP TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND WOULD REALLY LIKE TO MAKE SURE IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER DELAYS OR PROBLEMS. THAT YOU NOTIFY THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP YOU AND ASSIST YOU TO MAKE SURE THOSE COME ONLINE. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. ONE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE ON THE PATIENT'S RIGHTS ADVOCATES -- THE ADDITION THERE FOR SIX AND A HALF NEW POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED FOR THE JAIL BASED -- TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF JAIL BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE -- THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND MORE COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHERE SERVICES ARE BETTER PROVIDED AND AND THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY IN THE MULTIPLE -- INVESTIGATIONS WE DO IN COUNTY JAILS AND THE LITIGATION THAT WE DO IN COUNTY JAILS ON THE PRIMARILY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH -- TREATMENT BUT AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE THE PATIENTS RIGHTS -- CONTRACT -- SO WE'RE UNCLEAR ON WHAT MIGHT BE THE THOUGHT HERE ON AND HOW OR IF IT'S EXPECTED THAT -- WE WOULD BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE EXISTING CONTRACT TO INDEED PERFORM THOSE PATIENTS RIGHT SERVICES FOR THESE JAIL BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND IF SO -- I THINK THE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED HERE -- FOR SIX AND A HALF POSITIONS WOULD BE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE -- TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES SO I'M NOT SURE IF INDEED THERE'S ADDITIONAL DOLLARS -- THAT MAY BE SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT -- THE THOUGHT WOULD BE. TO TO USE FOR THIS CONTRACT OR IF -- THIS WOULD BE THE EXPECTED WE WOULD PICK UP SIX AND A HALF ADDITIONAL -- POSITIONS WITH -- WITH THESE FUNDS WE'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN OF COURSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND TRY AND SORT THAT PICKED PEACE OUT BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK WE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION THAT THEY'RE GOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THIS TERM MEMBERS COULD BE PROVIDED WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FRAZIER AND RUBIO FOR THEIR KIND COMMENTS I KNOW -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER AROMAS AND AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS RUBIO AND I BELIEVE YOU -- TO MISTER CHAIR HAVE TAKEN TOURS OF THE FACILITIES IN AN ERROR DISTRICTS AND AND SO WE GREATLY APPRECIATE. YOUR SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS THAT UR STAFF GOES THROUGH HOME. I WOULD AGREE WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IN THE SENSE THAT THE STEEL BASED PROGRAMS ARE GREAT PROGRAMS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT STATE STAFF SHOULD BE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES -- THESE ARE STATE CONTRADA CONTRACTED OUT -- BEDS SO THEREFORE WE BELIEVE IT'S THE STATE EMPLOYEES THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE SERVICE I'LL BE CONT COMMENTING MORE ON OTHER ITEMS IN THE BUDGET LATER. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT -- WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE. TOO WHEN YOU'RE READY DIRECTOR. AGAIN SEVENTY CLENDENIN ACTING DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT I'M JOINED BY A DEBBIE DIRECTOR CHRIS EDENS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR FOR FORENSIC SERVICES -- DIVISION. BUT I ALSO HAVE BEHIND ME. CHRISTINE SAKAKI IS OUR CHIEF COUNSEL ALSO BE STEPPING UP IN A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE ITEMS. SO FIRST OF ALL JUST A KIND OF PROVIDE OF YOU OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THE I. S. T. -- WAIT LIST AND I HAS BEEN KIND OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE. SO IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE A GROWTH IN OUR WAIT LIST FOR THE PLACEMENT OF INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIALS -- WITHIN A STATE HOSPITAL BED. ICE TEAS ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME. AND HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE COURT TO BE TOO MENTALLY ILL TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OR TO ACTIVELY A SISTER COUNCIL IN THEIR DEFENSE. THE COURT WHEN THEY'RE FOUND INCOMPETENT. EXCUSE ME SUSPENDS THEIR PROCEEDINGS AND WHILE THEY UNDERGO A COMPETENCY RESTORATION WITH US. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED FELONY CRIMES AND OUR FOUNDING COMMENT TO BE REFER ARE REFERRED TO THE S. H. -- FOR THE RESTORATION OF CONSTANCY SERVICES AND THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT TIME FOR AN I. S. T. PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE WAS THREE YEARS SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN I'M CHANGE THAT TIME FRAME TO TWO YEARS AFFECTED THIS PAST JANUARY. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAD AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED I IS TEASE WE SERVE A TOTAL OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PATIENT FEISTY PATIENTS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE DAYS. IN OUR JOB BASE COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM WE SERVED AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN LAST YEAR. A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTY TWO PATIENTS WERE SERVED THROUGH THOSE BEDS. AND THEY HAD AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF FIFTY SEVEN DAYS WHEN THEY WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE JAIL BASS COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND OFTEN -- SOME PATIENTS HAVE. TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A STATE HOSPITAL FOR FURTHER SERVICES AND THOSE PATIENTS HAD EIGHTY AN AVERAGE LIKE THE STATE OF ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN DAYS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE I. S. T. IS THAT BEEN REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THAT GROWTH WE RECEIVED AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO I S. T. REFERRALS PER MONTH. IN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAVE BEEN AVERAGING FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN PER MONTH THAT'S A 78% GROWTH IN THE REFERRAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND JUST A 10% GROWTH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THOUGH. AND WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE WEIGHTLESS BUT IT DOES CONTINUE TO GROW -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SENSE OF THE IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IT GREW TO ITS HIGHEST POINT IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR AT ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN BY JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE GAME SOME TRACTION AND WE BROUGHT. IT DOWN TO EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX AND TODAY WE CURRENTLY HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SET AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS ON THE WAIT LIST. THIS GROWTH IN AYE IS TO REFERRALS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA TREND IT'S A NATIONAL TREND. OUR COLLEAGUES IN STATE HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THIS WITH THIS ISSUE. AND AS A RESULT OF THE RISING WIRELESS THAT WE'VE BEEN ALL FACING OFF FACING THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS COURT PROCEEDINGS BOTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY -- LOOKING OUT WHAT THE REQUIRED TIMELINE FOR ADMISSION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SHOULD BE. NATIONALLY STATES HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO MET I SEE PATIENTS WITHIN A SHORT OF SEVEN DAYS FROM DATE OF REFERRAL IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN UNDER VARIOUS COURT ORDERS. FROM VARIOUS COUNTIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS RANGING FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIXTY DAYS TO ADMIT PATIENTS WERE FOUND INCOMPETENT. WE'VE DONE MANY EFFORTS -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING WEIGHTLESS AND THE GROWING REFERRALS. FIRST OF ALL CAPACITY HAM BUT WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT HIM FOR A HAS IMPROVING OUR SYSTEMS AS WELL AS RESEARCHING THE DEMAND IN RESPONDING TO THE DEMAND. SO WITH RESPECT TO CAPACITY WE'VE ADDED OVER FOUR HUNDRED BED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN IN ORDER TO ATTRACT GUIDE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT CAPACITY IN OUR HI STATE HOSPITALS FOR ICED. WE'VE EXPANDED THE JAIL BASED PROGRAM I MENTIONED BEFORE WE'RE CURRENTLY AT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BEDS. IN TEN COUNTIES. AND WE ALSO HAVE EVERYWHERE APPROVED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- TO CONSTRUCT A SECURE TREATMENT AREA AROUND AN EXISTING BUILDING AT METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL I WANT TOUCH TOO MUCH ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE FURTHER IN THE AGENDA. WE'VE ALSO DONE SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS -- AS A RESULT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE ESTABLISHED A PATIENT MANAGEMENT UNIT. WHOSE -- FOCUSES ON THE CENTRALIZED RECEIPT AND PROCESSING OF ALL OF THESE IDEAS T. REFERRALS THEY MANAGE THE PATIENT MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND WITH THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY AND COORDINATE THAT WITH THE JOB AT JABAL JOB IS COMPANIES TREATMENT AND OUR COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. AND THEN MAXIMIZE THE UTILIZATION OF OUR BED CAPACITY. WE PARTICIPATED IN I. S. T. WORKGROUP WITH MANY OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS AS WELL AND AND EARLY EFFORTS FROM THATWORK GROUP RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT ALSO FURTHER STREAMLINED THE I A STEAMY. PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO DEMAND WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING IN A HARD TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE BE REFERRED TO THE STATE HOSPITALS AND WHAT THAT POPULATION LOOKS LIKE SO WE CAN BETTER SERVE IT. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF AYE IS TO USE AS A NATIONAL TREND AND MULLIN LOOKING AT NATIONAL DATA IT DEMONSTRATES A LARGE INCREASE OVER TIME AND I IS TO I SEE PATIENTS COMMITTED TO STATE HOSPITALS THE DATA INDICATES APPROXIMATE RISE OF 70%. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF ICE TEAS. THE EXACT CAUSE AND A RECENT NATIONAL SEARCH IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE HOWEVER THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TIMING OF THE RECENT NATIONAL SURGE IN THE RECESSION. WHEN LOOKING AT COMMON THEMES WITHIN OUR DS H. DATA AND WITH LOOKING THROUGH YEARS OF RESEARCH WE HAD ABOUT A DECADE OF OF DATA THROUGH RESEARCH THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED WITH THE UC DAVIS -- WE LOOKED OUT THE COMMON TRENDS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE AND THEN WE DID AS A SEVERAL MONTH STUDY OF NEW ADMISSIONS TO TALK TO TO COMPARE WHAT OUR NEW ADMISSIONS A PLANK OF ACROSS THAT TEN YEAR STUDY. OVERALL THE DATA DIDN'T REFLECT ANY MAJOR CHANGES IN THE CHARACTERISTIC RESTRICTS OF THE POPULATION WITH THE X. -- EXCEPTION OF THE AND ARRESTED A FIFTEEN OR MORE HAD FIFTEEN OR MORE PRIOR REST PRIOR TO THEIR MISSION HAD SUBSTANTIALLY GROUND FIFTEEN OR MORE PRIOR PRIOR ARRESTS. WE ALSO AND THE MAJORITY OF I SEE PATIENTS THAT ARE REFERRED TO THE S. H. HAVE A MAJOR PSYCHOTIC OR MOOD DISORDER AND HAVE HAD. IT MENTIONED MULTIPLE RESTS APPROXIMATELY 47% THIS IS ANOTHER STATISTIC THAT WE GOING FROM OUR MORE RECENT -- A REVIEW OF THE AYE AYE IS HE ADMISSIONS IS THAT 47% WERE COMING INTO US AT IT FROM AN AND SHELTERED -- HOMELESS STATUS PRIOR TO THEIR TIME OF THEIR ARREST. AND THEN -- WE ALSO COMPARED R. I. S. T. DATA TO MEDICAL DATA AND 2407% OF THE I GUESS HE'S HAD NOT ACCESS THE MEDIC HOW REIMBURSABLE. A SERVICES -- PRIOR TO THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. SO AS A RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH BE UNDERSTOOD THAT MANY OF AYE AYES TIAS ARE COMING TO US AS A RESULT OF NON VIOLENT FLONIES ARISING FROM SYMPTOMS OF THEIR UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS AND CONDITIONS OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THIS UNDERSTANDING BECAME THE BASIS FOR LAST YEAR'S DIVERSION PROPOSAL -- WHERE WE WERE APPROVED LAST YEAR FOR HIGH DEVELOP NEW OR EXPANDING EGGS AN EXISTING DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND I AM GOING TO ASK IF YOU DIRECTOR -- EDENS WHO IS A DOCTOR OF OUR FRIENDS EX SERVICES DIVISION WHO OR HER TEAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND A MEMBERS OF OUR CLINICAL OPERATIONS DIVISION. ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT DIVERSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A CHRIS EATON'S I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE FRIENDS EX SERVICES DIVISION -- AND AS AS STEPHANIE HAD MENTIONED THAT -- MY DIVISION IS PARTNERING WITH OUR CLINICAL OPERATIONS DIVISION OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR TO IMPLEMENT -- THE DIVERSION FUNDING PROGRAM. SO I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT UPDATE TODAY -- SO AS STEPHANIE MENTIONED WE WERE APPROVED FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR -- OF THAT TOTAL AMOUNT ON NINETY ONE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS NINETY ONE MILLION WAS FOCUSED ON WHAT WE CALL OUR TOP FIFTEEN COUNTIES. AND THESE FIFTEEN COUNTY IS -- REALLY REPRESENT OUR HIGHEST RATE OF REFERRALS AS A FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HIGHEST RATE OF FELONY I S. T. REFERRALS TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN -- AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WAS -- AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE -- FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO OTHER COUNTIES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN -- APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS SO OUR OVER ARCHING GOALS FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE TO REALLY ONE DEMONSTRATE -- EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT CAN SUPPORT THE DIVERSION OF THE SPECIFIC POPULATION SO REALLY WHAT IT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SERVE THIS POPULATION OUT IN THE COMMUNITY -- TO OBVIOUSLY TO REDUCE THE RATE OF FELONY ICED TEA REFERRALS COMING INTO OUR DEPARTMENT -- BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE DO THINK THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REFERRALS COMING IN READ THE COULD BE BETTER SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO LASTLY OUR OUR OUR ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO INTEGRATE INDIVIDUALS INTO LONG TERM COMMUNITY TREATMENT -- WITH THE HOPE OF REVERSING THAT CYCLE OF OF CRIMINALIZATION AND AND BACK INTO THE INTO THE JAILS -- AND SO ARE OUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSED AROUND SORT OF THREE MAIN DOMAINS. AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT AND FUNDING PROCESS. HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET THESE THIS MONEY OUT TO THE COUNTY IS -- AND WHAT WE NEED ELATION WHAT IT SUPPORTS TO THE COUNTY IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT. THESE PROGRAMS -- OR WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT TO THE NEED TO TO PLAN TO JUST GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR. AND THEN LASTLY TO STRATEGIZE AROUND THE DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS -- TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. ON THE COUNTY IMPLEMENTATION FRONT -- BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR FUNDS WERE TARGET TO THE FIFTEEN COUNTIES WE PRIORITIZE PRIORITIZE THAT GROUP -- FIRST -- WE KICKED OFF THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN THE FALL AND THEN FOLLOWED THAT WITH THE REQUEST FOR LETTERS OF INTEREST PROCESS -- IN ORDER TO GAUGE -- INTEREST FROM OUR FIFTEEN COUNTIES ALL FIFTEEN COUNTIES EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING -- AND THEN -- SINCE THEN -- AS OF FEBRUARY WE ACTUALLY ARE IN ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SIX OF OUR COUNTIES -- LA BEING THE LARGEST COUNTY AND SO WITH THOSE SIX CONTRACTS WELL WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL CONTRACTS IN PLACE WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE LA THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH READY TO GO -- WE'RE JUST FINALIZING THOSE CON SO WITH THE SIX COUNTIES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY REPRESENT SERVING A PROJECTED POPULATION OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EITHER I IS TEASE OR AT RISK OF THAT I. S. T. -- FINDING -- AND THAT ALSO REPRESENTS ABOUT THAT WE WERE AWARDED. OR THAT WE WERE AUTHORIZED -- IN DECEMBER WE RELEASED OUR ROUND TO FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER COUNTIES -- AS OF CASH FEBRUARY WE RECEIVED -- THIRTEEN LETTERS OF INTENT -- FROM VARIOUS COUNTY IS TWO TO THREE OF THEM REPRESENTS SMALL COUNTIES. ON THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THEM -- AND CLOSES IN APRIL APRIL NINETEENTH -- AND SO WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS -- ESTABLISHING -- A SERIES OF OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WEBINARS TO ASSIST THOSE COUNTIES WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO TO COMPLETE THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS. ON THE SECOND FRONT IN TERMS OF OF SUPPORTING THE COUNTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING OUT TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITIES -- WE RECEIVE -- A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING -- FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS PROGRAM TO POSITIONS -- WE WE OF FILLED BOTH OF THOSE POSITIONS AS OF OF JANUARY OF THIS YEAR -- BUT AS PART OF THIS WE'VE REALLY ESTABLISHED A CROSS COLLABORATIVE TEAM OR A STEERING COMMITTEE. TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT COUNTIES HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE AND WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. TO PROVIDE AND BE RESPONSIVE TO THE TRAINING NEEDS OF THE COUNTIES -- AND SO SO WITH THAT WE PARTNER WITH THE COUNCIL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WE ALSO ARE PARTNERING WITH THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS JUSTICE CENTER -- TO SUPPORT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEED SO WORKING WITH EACH ADDITIONAL COUNSEL -- COUNTY BAKER. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- SEE SACK -- THE MAJOR COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS -- AC AS WELL -- AND SO WE'VE ON THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRONT WE'VE SENT ON A SERIES OF SURVEYS AS WELL AS CONTACTED EACH ONE OF OUR TOP FIFTEEN COUNTIES -- TO JUST HAVE. DISCUSSIONS ON WHERE ARE THEY OUT WITH THEIR PLANNING PROCESS WHAT DID THEY NEED HELP WITH -- ALMOST ALL OF THEM KIND OF CAME BACK WITH A SERIES OF OF SPECIFIC. ON THE TOP NEED BEING YOU KNOW HELP US IDENTIFY WHO COULD BE. WHO COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FINDING HOW -- HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY THOSE THAT COULD QUALIFY -- SO WE'VE -- ESTABLISHED AS I SAID A SERIES OF OF WEAPON OUR TRAININGS ONE JUST OCCURRED ON ON FRIDAY -- TO TO BROADCAST OUT TOWARD COUNTIES -- THE HOW TO IDENTIFY THE ELIGIBILITY OF FOLKS AND HOW -- TO ALSO IDENTIFY THE RISK ASSESSMENT -- ON THE DATA COLLECTION FRONT -- D. S. H. IS GOING TO JUST BE WORKING WITH OUR EXISTING FOR EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT UC DAVIS TO COLLECT AND REPORT STRUCTURE. TO STATUTORILY MANDATED DATA FROM EACH PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH IS THAT THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE WE HAVE -- AN EXISTING CONTRACT WITH UC DAVIS -- AND SO THEY'LL BE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH COUNTIES ON ON THE DATA COLLECTION FRONT -- I THINK THAT THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

THE JAIL BASS COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED FUNDING -- FOR ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AT JAIL BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE CONTINUED FUNDING FOR THE EXPANSION OF METRO STATE HOSPITAL. THE I. S. T. POPULATION -- CONTINUES TO BE A DIFFICULT POPULATION FOR JAILS TO DEAL WITH -- BAKERY CLASSIFICATION IS NOT -- TO TO SPEAK ILL OF THAT POPULATION BUT IT IT CREATES A VERY REAL OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN THE JAILS. AND SO HAVING -- DEDICATED TREATMENT PROGRAMMING SPACE AND TREATMENT SPACE THAT -- THOSE PATIENTS CAN BE DEALT WITH PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; BUT THAT CAN BE DEALT&lt;/c&gt; WITH AT THE JAIL THAT AVOIDS HAVING TO TRANSPORT SOMEONE WAIT FOR BED TRANSPORT THEM TO A STATE HOSPITAL BED -- HOPEFULLY BE RESTORED A COMPETENCY HAVE THEM COME BACK RUN THE RISK OF THE COMPENSATION HAVING THAT TREATMENT DONE AT THE JAILS -- HAS PROVEN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WE TYPICALLY SEE SHORTER LENGTH OF STAYS -- WE SEE CHEAPER -- PROVISIONS WE DO HAVE COUNTY EMPLOYEES DOING THAT WORK IN TERMS OF OF SHERIFF STAFF THERE ARE CONTRACTED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BUT IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL MODEL.

S. H. KANG. MOVIE THROUGH AND YOU CAN SEE SOME ARE CREATIVE PROCESS SEES THIS IS EXACTLY THE DIRECTION SHOULD GO -- IF TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND IN THE JAILS THANKS THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES ON THE ON THE GRANTS. ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE SPENDING DOWN THERE MAY SOME MONEY THERE'S A PROP SIXTY THREE IS WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THEM. HOLDING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY. AND NOT USING IT EFFECTIVELY CAN ANSWER THAT YEAH SO -- DEFINITE. DEATH I CAN'T SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF SPENDING IT DOWN BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE THE WAY THAT WE WROTE OUR PROPOSAL AND ARE ROLLING OUT THE CONTRACT THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE MATCHING FUNDS -- FOR MOST COUNTIES THAT THE 20% MATCH FOR SMALL COUNTIES IT'S A SEEING IS THAT COUNTIES ARE GETTING VERY CREATIVE WITH LEVERAGING -- AVAILABLE FUNDS -- WE ARE SEEING THE MHSAA USED AS AS PART OF THAT MATCH AND THEN WHERE -- MEDI CAL APPROPRIATE SERVICES MAKES SENSE -- THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING LEVERAGED AS WELL -- SO DEFINITELY THE COUNTIES ARE BEING CREATIVE AND ARE UTILIZING THOSE MHSAA DOLLARS I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES MIGHT BE MORE AROUND HAVING THOSE IMAGES STATE PLANS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND THEN AND GETTING ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS -- WHERE THAT PLAN -- HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE -- HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH A WE SEE AROUND THAT -- SO THAT SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THOSE IMAGES A DOLLARS. HEY PHILIP LEVERAGING BUT WHEN THEY'RE SITTING ON LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THEY CALL RESERVE FUNDS -- AND THEY'RE NOT BEING EFFECTIVE IN. PURPOSING FOR WHAT WE ALL WANT TO HAPPEN. ARE THE INTENDED PURPOSE FORM. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT USING YOUR DOLLARS. SO THEY CAN HOLD ON TO THEIR DOLLARS SO SPENDING DOWN THOSE RESERVES IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TILLY'S TO ME. I'M A BUDGETARY PROCESS THAT MAKES WAS. WAS INTENDED TO BE THAT BEING ON THE SHOW ON YOUR OF FOR YOUR INDUSTRY HELLO AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT HOW. YOUR PROCESSES ACTUALLY. MAKES THEM SPEND THE MONEY. ALSO DOWN TO VERY LOW RESERVES. I APPRECIATE THAT I ALSO -- EXCUSE -- I I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE THIS HUNDRED MILLION IS ONE TIME FUNDS -- THE QUESTION OF OF SUSTAINABILITY COMING UP AND SO PART OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE OFFERING TO THE COUNTY IS ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH. THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS JUSTICE CENTER IS PLANNING AROUND THAT AND WHILE WHILE WE CAN'T DO SOURCES TO USE WE CAN CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE AND HELP GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO TO PLAN AND CONTINUE THESE PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE AS MENTIONED BEFORE. OF FROM THE DIRECTOR THAT. EARLY INTERVENTION WOULD HAVE BEEN A AT A VERY OF USEFUL TOOL AND KEEPING POPULATION DOWN. AGAIN SHOT NORMA SUPPOSED TO BE MESA SO FOR IF YOU NEED LEGISLATION. TO HELP YOU. HELLO YOU CAN ENCOURAGE BUT WE CAN REQUIRE. SO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO KNOW THESE THINGS WHEN YOU'RE GOING OVER THESE GRANT PROGRAM SO THEY ARE UTILIZING EVERY DIME FOR IT'S EXPECTED CHOOSE. IF I MAY USE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER DANCE YOUR QUESTION CHRIS COOK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WITH REGARDS TO PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS -- IMAGES OF DOLLARS AND YOUR CONCERNS -- ON COUNTY SITTING ON RESERVES THERE HAS BEEN RECENT LEGISLATION PASSED. IN THE LAST YEAR TO THAT HAVE -- SET GUIDELINES AND TIME LIMITS ON COUNTY SPENDING OF THOSE DOLLARS AND IT'S TAKING STEPS FORWARD -- TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS THAT SPECIFIED THOSE PROCESSES FOR PERVERSION AND THOSE TIME LINES I KNOW I'M NOT TALKING BY THE TIME YOU WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE TOPICS THAT WE HAVE. I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TOP IN TALKING ABOUT THOSE IN MORE DETAIL ON THAT. THE COMING WEEK OR SO. BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE WAS LEGISLATION EITHER KILLED OR VETOED -- ALSO PURPOSED AND MAKING SURE SHORTER TIME LINES. OF THOSE GLORIA BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ACTUALLY JUST THANK YOU DIRECTOR ACTING DIRECTOR CLINTON -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE OUR THROUGHPUT AND THE DIVERSION PROGRAM THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE INVESTED SEEMS TO REALLY BE WORKING ON THREE PUT AND YOU'RE TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR THAT FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE BEEN SEEING INCREASING NUMBERS OF ICE TEA PATIENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AT A MINIMUM. TREADING WATER AND IT SEEMS THAT THE DIVERSION PROGRAM IS IS DOING THAT. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE DATA THAT COMES OUT OF UC DAVIS WILL ALLOW US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE. FOR MORE FUNDING AS NEEDED FOR THE DIVERSE -- TO YOUR CONTINUED EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE I'M JOINED BY A DOCTOR WERE BURTON WHO IS R. D. S. H. MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY OCTOBER CLINICAL OPERATIONS DIVISION. FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE THE REQUEST IS FOR A TOTAL OF NINETY FOUR POINT SIX POSITIONS AN EIGHTEEN POINT ONE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ON GOING. PHASED IN ACROSS THREE FISCAL YEARS AND THIS IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES NEEDED TO PERFORM. THE FORENSIC SERVICES WORKLOAD THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH COURT DIRECTED PATIENT TREATMENT RELATED TO SERVING PATIENTS WHO ARE COMMITTED AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS AND SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO PERFORM THE WORKLOAD WHICH INCLUDES FORENSIC EVALUATIONS REPORTING FOR THE COURT COURT TESTIMONY. FRIENDS A CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA TRACKING AND NEURO PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO EVALUATE STAFFING AMONG OUR FIVE STATE HOSPITALS BY PERFORMING A CLINICAL STAFFING STUDY WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF FOUR COMPONENTS. POSSIBLE FORENSIC DEPARTMENTS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE NURSING SERVICES PROTECTIVE SERVICES TREATMENT PLANNING AND DELIVER AN AND TREATMENT PLANNING AND DELIVERY. THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS THE OUTCOMES OF THE FIRST OF THOSE COMPONENTS THE HOSPITAL FRIENDS LIKE DEPARTMENTS. INCORPORATES ALL THE DATA AND RESEARCH R. D. S. H. RESEARCH TEAM. DURING THE STAFFING STUDY WE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS UNIT THROUGH THEIR MISSION BASED RUBIO. AND ADDITIONALLY WE CONTRACTED WITH COOPERATIVE PERSONAL SERVICES TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION OF THE STOPPING STUDY AND METHODOLOGIES. THERE ARE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS TO THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST ONE IS FIFTY THREE POINT ONE FORENSIC EVALUATOR POSITIONS FOR THE HOSPITAL'S FORENSIC DEPARTMENTS BASED IN ACROSS THREE YEARS. THE FORENSIC DEPARTMENT CITIES HOSPITALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FORENSIC EVALUATIONS AND COURT REPORTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FRIENDS AT PATIENTS. THIS FUNCTION REQUIRES FRIENDS ECKLEY TRAINED PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS THE UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE PHILOSOPHIES OF THEIR PRACTICE. THAT CAN PERFORM A FORENSIC ASSESSMENT OF A PATIENT WHICH CAN INCLUDE MENTAL COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS SOMETHING IS AMISS. HIS ME LOOKING UP THERE SOMETIMES DIAGNOSIS PROGRESSION IN TREATMENT AND VIOLENCE RESTORED SELF AND OTHERS. THEY PREPARE REPORTS THE COURT AND TESTIFY IN COURT TO COMMUNICATE AN UNBIASED CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE OF A PATIENT AS IT RELATES TO THE STATUTORY CREDIT CRITERIA. SURROUNDING THAT FOR THEIR FRIENDS A COMMITMENT. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. LAST YEAR WE SERVE NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FORENSIC PATIENTS WE MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE FORENSIC PATIENT. AND EACH FRIENDS THAT COMMITMENT TYPE THERE ARE SUCH A TOTALLY REQUIRED REPORTS THAT WE MUST AT SAID SUBMIT TO THE COURT I PRESCRIBED -- INCREMENTS DURING THE PATIENT'S DAY LAST YEAR WE FILED A BIRTH OF ELEVEN THOUSAND REPORTS THE COURT REGARDING OUR FRIENDS AT PATIENTS. WELL IT IS A MAJOR FUNCTION HISTORICALLY WE HAVE NOT HAD A STAFFING STANDARD OR METHOD FOR PROVIDING NECESSARY STAFFING FOR THIS IS FOR THE SERVICES. DESPITE OUR GROWING FORENSIC POPULATION. TO ADDRESS THE THIS MANDATED FRIENDS LIKE WORKLOAD THE HOSPITALS HAVE UTILIZED OR TREATING CLINICIANS OR REDIRECTED RESOURCES FROM TREATMENT TEAMS NURSING SERVICES AND OTHER HOSPITAL FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS GROWING WORKLOAD. THIS PROPOSAL ESTABLISHES A STAFFING SET A STANDARD METHODOLOGY ACROSS ALL THE HOSPITALS BASED ON AN ESTIMATED NUMBER OF RECORDS OF REPORTS. TO BE COMPLETED ANNUALLY THE TIME TO COMPLETE ALL STEPS RELATED TO THOSE COURT REPORTS AND EVALUATIONS. AND THE TESTIMONY AND TRAVELED. BY ESTABLISHING A DEDICATED FORENSIC RESOURCE -- THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM OUR TREATING CLINICIANS IT ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGE THAT ARISE FROM THE TREATMENT TEAM CLINICIANS FULFILLING THE ED A DUAL ROLE OF BOTH THE TREATMENT FROM PROVIDER AND THE FRIENDS I CAN BUY A WAITER. THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS A PROPOSAL IS -- SIXTEEN POINT THREE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS -- FOR FRIENDS THAT CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA TRACKING PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. WITH ALL THE ACTIVITY AND REPORTS RELATED TO THE FRIENDS OF PATIENT THERE'S A SECOND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA AND TRACKING WHEN REPORTS ARE DUE TO ENSURE THE REPORT CERTIFIED FILED TIMELY WITH THE COURTS. ADDITIONALLY MANY CLINICIANS ARE SUBPOENAED AND CALLED TO TESTIFY IN COURT REGARDING THEIR VALUATIONS WHICH IS ALSO A FUNCTION THAT REQUIRES COORDINATION AND TRACKING. SO THIS PROPOSAL STANDARDIZES THE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS NEEDED TO PERFORM THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND COURT -- TRACKING WORK BASED ON THE STANDARD CASELOAD OF ONE TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND PROVIDES ONE POSITION FOR YOU TO THE HOSPITAL'S TO LEAD THE SUBPOENA AND TO AND TESTIMONY DATA TRACKING. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TWENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS FOR NEURO PSYCHOLOGICAL NUR NEUROPSYCHOLOGY ASSESSMENTS AND COGNITIVE REMEDIATION PILOT. PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS AND THIS RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR INCREASED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS. MANY OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE DEFICITS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCED EFFECTIVENESS AND CLINICAL TREATMENT AGGRESSIVE ACTS AND LONGER LENGTH OF STAY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. AND CURRENT RESEARCH IDENTIFIES THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF ALL NEW ADMISSIONS MAY REQUIRE SECONDARY NEURO PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. THE RECORD RESOURCES REQUESTED FOR ICAL ASSESSMENTS AS CONSERVATIVE AND WILL PROVIDE A TESTING FOR UP 225% OF OUR ADMISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT A NEURO PSYCHOLOGICAL COGNITIVE REMEDIATION TRACK -- TREATMENT PILOT OUR METROPOLITAN AND NAPA STATE HOSPITALS. AND THIS IS A FOCUS TREATMENT PROGRAM -- FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SEVERE NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- AS YOU HEARD IN THE DEPARTMENT'S PRESENTATION ONE OF THE PRIMARY JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE DEDICATED FORENSIC EVALUATOR STAFF. IS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN THESE CLINICIANS PERFORM THESE DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR OWN PATIENTS. WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN AND DO AGREE THAT THIS DOES NEED TO BE RESOLVED WE THINK IT POTENTIALLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. COULD BE TO HAVE EXISTING CLINICIANS PERFORM THESE RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO OTHER CLINICIANS PATIENTS. ARM ACCORDINGLY WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A DEDICATED EVALUATORS BE APPROVED. INSTEAD WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT. TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PILOT THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY OF AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE TO PILOT THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT THE THIS PLAN BY APRIL. ONE NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA TRACKING STAFF WE IT THIS THIS PART OF THE PROPOSAL CAN KIND OF BE THOUGHT OF IN TWO DIFFERENT PIECES -- FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A PIECE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF STAFF THAT THEY CURRENTLY USE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THIS WORKLOAD. WE FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION SHOWING THAT THEIR EXISTING STAFFING LEVELS ARE INSUFFICIENT. SO WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING APPROVING THAT SECONDLY THERE WERE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF THAT WERE BEING REQUESTED TO REFINE THAT THE STAFFING STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE ESTABLISHING FOR THE FORENSIC VALUE WAITERS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING. APPROVING THOSE POSITIONS WERE ALSO NOT RECOMMENDING -- APPROVING THESE CORRESPONDING ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE NEURO PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS WE DO THINK THAT THESE EVALUATIONS COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF IDENTIFYING PATIENTS THAT ARE AT RISK OF VIOLENCE. AND MORE EFFECTIVELY TREATING OTHER PATIENTS SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THOSE RESOURCES BE APPROVED -- WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDUCT COGNITIVE REMEDIATION PILOT WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY PROMISING APPROACH. THE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT DESPITE SOURCES ARE OPPOSED. ACCORDINGLY WERE RECOMMENDING THAT FUNDING FOR THE PILOT BE LIMITED TO THREE YEARS AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE PILOT. AFTER THE THREE YEARS HAS EXPIRED TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER TO PROVIDE ONGOING AND OR EXPANDED FUNDING AT THAT TIME. THE NO SIR. BERMAN FUNDS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JC THOMPSON APARTMENT FINANCE I'M. WE WE DISAGREE WITH THE LA OWES -- RECOMMENDATIONS IN A NUMBER OF THESE AREAS I AM I JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND WE WORKED VERY EXTENSIVELY TIME. FOR OVER GOSH EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT HOSPITALS AS PART OF OUR MISSION BASED REVIEW PROJECT -- AT THE MISSION BASED REVIEW PROJECT THE GOAL IS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES. YOU REALLY LOOK AT I'M INNOVATIVE WAYS OF AND OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A FROM STANDPOINT -- YOU KNOW TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT THE THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND THAT ANYTHING THAT. WOULD BE EXTRANEOUS WOULD BE YOU KNOW KIND OF LOOKED AT ON A PRIORITIZE BASIS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING USE OF OUR LIMITED RESOURCES. AND WE HAVE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME LOOKING AT THE STUFFING STUDY -- THAT AT STATE HOSPITALS AND PUT TOGETHER MANY MANY HOURS I'M MANY OF THE OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE LA I WAS ASKING I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE INITIALLY AUST AS WELL. AND BEING NEW TO THIS -- INDUSTRY AND I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY CAME AWAY FROM THE PROCESS FEELING LIKE TIME. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CLINICAL STAFF EXPERIENCE IT -- RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY ARE CALLED AWAY TO TESTIFY IN COURT SO WHETHER THEY ARE WHETHER THIS IS FOR THEIR OWN PATIENT OR FOR PEER -- AS THE LA WAS PROPOSING IT WOULD STILL REMOVE THAT CLINICIAN FROM THE FACILITY WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT SEEING PATIENTS. THEY'RE NOT THERE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS TO OBSERVE WHATEVER I MIGHT BE GOING ON WITH THE PATIENTS THAT. YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD INTERVENE IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER MAYBE COULD BE -- MEDIATED NOT THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO. I'M WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WERE RECOMMENDING -- AT SEPARATE TO CLINICIAN WAS AND IN ORDER TO KEEP THE TREATING CLINICIANS ON THE UNIT AND PRESENT FOR THE TIME FOR THE PATIENTS -- IN ADDITION -- WE ARE RECOMMENDING SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST -- THE SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALIST SEES ME WHICH IS A ENTIRELY DIFFERENT -- DISCIPLINE THEN THAT THE PSYCHIATRIST THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING CALLED AWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LEAD OF THE TREATMENT TEAM. OBVIOUSLY STOP ENOUGH I'M MISSTATING ANYTHING HERE -- AND SO USING OF THE LA OWES MODEL WE WE BELIEVE WOULD ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE TO USE THE PSYCHIATRISTS TO DO. WORK THAT ACTUALLY THE THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND IS IS ABLE TO DO -- A FINALLY ONE OF ONE OF THE OTHER COMPELLING REASONS I'M IS THAT THIS IS THIS -- WE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FORENSIC WORK THE STATE TO BE DONE IS REALLY MORE OF A NICHE AREA OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY THIS ROUTE THAT REQUIRES -- ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND REALLY OWN THAT LAYS STANDPOINT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DIFFERENT ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES RIGHT YOU HAVE THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW ENGINE OR ELECTRICAL STRUCTURAL. THEY REALLY DO HAVE A SPECIALTY AREA AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A A GOOD LATE -- COMPARISON TO MAKE HERE I WAS OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND THEN I COULD GOING TO FOR SURE -- AND SO IT REALLY HAVING THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO THE JOB -- I THINK IS IS CRITICAL HERE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT THEY HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERTISE -- AND THAT WERE NOT SIMPLY CROSS TRAINING A MORE GENERALISED CLASS TO DO THE WORK OF OF A SPECIALIST -- AND SO I THAT THAT'S ON THE ISSUE OF OF THE THE PEER REVIEW -- IN TERMS OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND WE REALLY -- LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE ALSO -- FOR QUITE A LENGTH OF TIME AND WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THAT EACH FACILITY IS FULLY MANAGING THEIR DIFFERENCE A CASE MANAGEMENT DIFFERENTLY AND BY FOR IN THAT CASE MANAGEMENT WHAT WE MEAN THAT THEY WERE PLEADED IN A SIMILAR FASHION IN A TIMELY FASHION. THAT THE COURTS GETTING ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND RIGHT AROUND ELEVEN THOUSAND REPORTS ANNUALLY THAT'S A LOT OF OF MANAGEMENT THE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. AND SO WHAT WE WERE HOPING -- WITH PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS IT REALLY THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICES -- AMONGST THE FACILITIES AND BE ABLE TO KIND OF SHARE LESSONS LEARNED BETWEEN THEM -- AND ADDITIONALLY KIND OF PROVING THAT LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE COURT THAT THEY'RE HAVING CONSISTENT STUFF TO DEAL WITH. IF THERE ARE CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF IN PLACE THE WORK STILL HAS TO GET DONE ITS COURT MANDATED AND SO IF THERE'S NOT AN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. TO PERFORM THE WORK AGAIN IT'S BEEN PERFORMED BY THE CLINICIAN IN SOME CASES BY PSYCHIATRISTS AND THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE -- PAPERWORK. I'M STILL WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL -- CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND IN TERMS OF THE DATA TRACKING STOCK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEYS TO ME OF THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IF WE IF WE CAN'T. TRACK. AND REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA OF HOW WE'RE UTILIZING OUR STAFF -- THEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE OR IF IT'S BEING EFFECTIVE AND IT'S A PRETTY MINIMAL INVESTMENT OF FIVE POSITIONS -- TO WRITE REALLY -- ESTABLISH. A KIND OF A TO LIKE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU VAST I'M HERE TODAY I THINK COULD BE THE DATA COULD BE IMPROVED BY YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL DATA TRACKING STAFF -- IN TERMS OF THE NEURO PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAM AND I WE APPRECIATE THE LA AS RECOGNITION THAT -- THAT THE INTENTIONAL EVALUATIONS -- SEEM APPROPRIATE WE WOULD -- JUST RESTATE THAT -- ARE ESTAMOS VERY CONSERVATIVE FOR THE CLINICAL RESEARCH IT'S COMING OUT OF PATTON ACTUALLY INDICATES THAT IT'S CLOSER 250%. OF PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM THAT ADDITIONAL EVALUATION AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS -- THAT UP 225% OF PATIENTS WOULD GET THAT EVALUATION SO WE'RE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT -- THAT REALLY WORK WERE UNDER SHOOTING HERE BUT AGAIN WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY KIND OF STUDY THAT AND COME BACK -- IF NECESSARY -- AND IN TERMS OF THE COGNITIVE READING REMEDIAL COGNITIVE AND ALL IT DOCTOR RIVER TALK ABOUT THIS THAT SOME MORE BUT THERE ARE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION -- PROGRAMS IN PLACE AT A COUPLE OF THE HOSPITALS AND IT RESEARCH FROM THOSE PROGRAMS HAS SHOWN IT TO BE EFFECTIVE SO WE'RE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT -- THAT EVEN A WORD FOR PILOTING AT HOSPITALS THAT DON'T. HAVE PROGRAMS AT ALL THERE'S DEFINITELY RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE -- CONCEPT [inaudible] THANK YOU. WITH THE DEPARTMENT LIKE TO RESPOND DIRECTLY OR SURE I'M KATE WERE WRITTEN ON THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. JUST A GENERAL -- COMMENTS ABOUT FRIENDS EVALUATIONS THESE ARE VERY SPECIALIZED -- EVALUATIONS THAT GO INTO THE REPORT WRITING I DID A FELLOWSHIP FOUR YEAR FOLLOWING MY FOUR YEARS OF GENERAL ADULT PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY JUST TO LEARN HOW TO DO THESE KINDS OF EVALUATIONS AND WRITE A REPORT. THEY TAKE A DIFFERENT SKILL SETS YOU KNOW WERE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS WERE VERY EMPATHIC AND COMPASSIONATE WHEN YOU'RE WRITING A FORENSIC REPORT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY ANALYTICAL. YOU HAVE TO BE VERY OBJECTIVE NOT EVERY MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN CAN DO A GOOD FRIENDS LIKE A VALUATION A RIGHT A GOOD. A FORENSIC REPORT THE WAY WE'RE DOING THIS NOW OUT OF NECESSITY WHICH IS THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING IT AS WE SORT OF EVOLVED INTO THIS FRIEND SIX SYSTEM ALSO WRITES THE REPORTS IN MOST CASES THE PSYCHIATRIST. DOES ALL THE TESTIFYING TO THE REPORT IN ADDITION TO TAKING CARE OF A FULL CASELOAD DOING ALL THE MEN MANAGEMENT DOING ALL THE GROUPS IT CETERA. THIS CREATES A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THE PROBLEM THE LA -- SPOKE TO IS VERY REAL THE ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY HAVING YOUR TREE -- ALSO BEING YOUR EVALUATOR AND JUST ABOUT EVERY PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION OUT THERE SAYS THIS IS AN ETHICAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST --% HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE WITH A LACK OF TRAINING I CERTAINLY IF WE HAD A DEDICATED FRIENDS A GOOD VALUE WAITERS WE COULD FOCUS ON THE TRAINING GET PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD A POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN AREN'T BOARD CERTIFIED. UP TO SPEED BUT TRAINING OUR ENTIRE GENERALIST STAFF APPROVES CUMBERSOME. I SPOKE TO THE LACK OF SKILLS AND ABILITY SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE NOT CUT OUT TO TESTIFY IN COURT AS A FORMER FRIENDS IT CHIEF I CAN TELL YOU. ABOUT SOME STORIES -- WHERE WITH THAT BECAME CLEAR? AND THEN THERE ARE JUST INEFFICIENCIES SO IN IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSED REVIEW PROCESS IT'S INEFFICIENT. YES IT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY. TO SOME EXTENT -- BUT YOU'D HAVE A CLINICIAN FROM ANOTHER UNIT WHO WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR PATIENTS. GO AND GET FAMILIAR WITH IN AN SOME OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR DECADES REVIEWING THAT CASE COULD TAKE DAYS -- PERFORMING THE ASSESSMENTS WRITING THE REPORT AND THEN CALL IT GETTING CALLED AWAY TO TESTIFY SO IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER CLINICIAN COMING IN TO DO THE FRIENDS OF THE VALUATIONS. ACTUALLY ADDING TO OUR WORKLOAD NOW -- AND WE WERE BETTER OFF BEFORE THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS IN ADDITION IF YOU HAVE A PEER REVIEW PROCESS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PEER REVIEWER SO THIS IS ANOTHER WORKLOAD ADDITION TO OUR STAFF THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER THIS. PROPOSED MODEL BY THE LA -- ADDITIONALLY THE PEER REVIEW OR PROCESS WON'T RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY I THINK YOU HEARD OUR DIRECTOR TALKING ABOUT THE PRESSURES ON OUR SYSTEMS TO ADMIT PEOPLE THAT MEANS A LOT OF PATIENT MOVEMENT AND THAT MEANS. WE CAN'T GUARANTEE WHICH PATIENTS GOING TO BE ON WHOSE CASELOAD ON A GIVEN DAY UNFORTUNATELY SO WHILE THIS PERSON MAY HAVE -- AND EVALUATE OF ROLE TODAY TOMORROW THAT PERSON TO BE DEAR DOCTOR AND SO WE STILL ARE BACK TO THE ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY IN THE RISK THAT IT PUTS OUR CLINICIANS THAT -- WE HAVE HAD VERY VERY BAD OUTCOMES -- WHEN A PSYCHIATRIST HAVE GONE INTO COURT FOR EXAMPLE AND SAID SOMEONE NEEDS INVOLUNTARY MEDICATIONS -- WE'VE HAD PSYCHIATRIST NOT COME BACK TO WORK AGAIN AFTER A CASES LIKE THAT. SAID THE DO AGENCY ISSUE WON'T BE RESOLVED ALL THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS WILL DO IS ADD TO OUR CURRENT WORKLOAD. ADDITIONALLY THE PEER REVIEW OUR PROCESS DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF LACK OF SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. A FRIENDS AGO VALUE WAITERS OUT OF ALL OF OUR CLINICIANS AND IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE TRAINING ISSUE WE ESTIMATE WOULD TAKE DOZENS OF HOURS TO GET PEOPLE UP TO THE SPEED OF BEING A GOOD FRIENDS OF THE VALUE RATE -- THAT'S TIME LEARN HOW TO DO GOOD CYCLE PHARMACOLOGY GOOD BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS. AND FOR THESE REASONS ARE WE DO NOT FEEL THE PEER REVIEW OUR MODEL WOULD WORK. HELLO ANY RESPONSE SURE SO ONE THING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT A LOT OF THE WEAKNESSES WITH THE PEER REVIEW MODEL ALSO EXIST IN THE CURRENT. ONE CURRENTLY -- CLINICIANS ARE BEING CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR CASE LOAD TO DO THIS WORK. THEY WOULD JUST BE BEING CALLED THE WAY TO DO THIS WORK FOR DIFFERENT PATIENTS SO THIS ONE NECESSARILY PUT US IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WE ARE NOW. THE OTHER THING WE HAD NOTE IS WE WERE PROVIDED WITH DATA TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS COMING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW ARE INSUFFICIENT. THERE WERE SOME ANECDOTAL ACCOUNTS BUT NOTHING QUANTITATIVE THAT WE COULD REALLY SINK OUR TEETH INTO. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT -- TRAINING WE THINK TRAINING COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT -- IT'S SOMEWHAT TROUBLING. BUT THE CLINICIANS WERE ATTEMPTING TO SAY RESTORE PATIENT TO COMPETENCY AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS SURROUNDING WHAT JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR TO CLEAR PATIENT COMPETENT SO WE THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT IS A PROBLEM. A TRAINING PROGRAM -- IS IN ORDER WITH THREE THE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY ALREADY HAVING BEEN PUT IN PLACE AT A COUPLE STATE HOSPITALS -- SPECIFICALLY AT PATTON WEIRD NOTE THAT THE STAFFING AND THE APPROACH IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU NOW SO WE DON'T CONSIDER THAT -- AN EFFECTIVE TEST OF WHETHER OR NOT THE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION WOULD BE EFFECTIVE AND WE THINK A PILOT IS STILL. IN ORDER -- AND THEN THE THE OTHER THING I DID WANT TO KNOW IS WE WEREN'T PROVIDED WITH DATA TO SHOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFING THAT THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA STAFF. ARE UNABLE TO DO THERE THE COMPLETE THEIR WORK LOAD NOW AND THAT CLINICIANS ARE BEING FORCED TO DO SO. THANK YOU SIR. AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. THREE HEATHER SALIH FROM AS MAY TWENTY SIX TWENTY WE REPRESENT THE SENIOR. PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALISTS SPECIALISTS THE PSYCHOLOGIST -- AND WE ARE. CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUGGESTION OF THE PEER REVIEW FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I THINK IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED TODAY AND TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRAINING. AND THE CLINICAL EXPERTISE WE HAVE VERY GOOD CLINICIANS WHO MAY NOT BE GOOD COURT REPORTING. THE VALUE WAITERS OR WRITERS OR OR ABLE TO GIVE TESTIMONY -- SO THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT I THINK -- PRETTY WELL BUT I I WANTED TO ADD A COUPLE OF ISSUES. OF FOR ONE YEAH WE HAVE IS THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK OF GROUPS. THOSE GROUPS ARE ARE FACILITATED BY CLINICIANS THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL SO IF YOU COULD HAVE A PEER REVIEW PERSON WHO IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING TREATMENT IN A GROUP JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT% ON THEIR CASE SO THEY WILL STILL HAVE THAT. INTERACTION IN THIS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST WILL STILL EXIST FOR THE IT IN THAT SITUATION -- ADDITIONALLY -- AS AS WAS POINTED OUT WHEN. WHEN WE HAVE PAPERWORK WE HAVE A SAYING AS A CLINICIAN I GUESS I SHOULD SAY I WORK AT CLING TO STATE HOSPITAL? AND WE HAVE A SAYING THAT SOMETIMES WERE TREATING THE PAPER INSTEAD OF THE PATIENT. AND SO EVERY MOMENT WE TAKE THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT THE PAPER. THE PATIENT IS GOING WITHOUT TREATMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS THAT THE PATIENT IS THE STABILIZED. THE VIOLENCE GOES UP NOT ONLY GET STAFF BUT AGAINST OTHER PATIENTS AS WELL. THEN YOU HAVE -- YOU IT YOU HAVE THE VIOLENCE GOES UP WE HAVE A HIGHER TURNOVER RATE WE HAVE TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO TRAIN THEM WE HAVE A HARD TIME. RETAINING OUR STAFF AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THEN -- WE'RE RELYING MORE ON CONTRACTOR WE HAVE A CONTINUITY OF CARE WHICH DESTABILIZE THE PATIENT AND INCREASES THE OF VIOLENCE SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT IN FAVOR AT ALL OF THE PEER REVIEW. THANK YOU MA'AM. A BILL JOHNSON PRESIDENT OF ASKED ME LOCAL TWENTY SIX TWENTY SHE KIND OF SAID EVERYTHING SHE TOOK ALL MY TALKING POINTS BUT I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT -- THE WE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WITH A BROWN ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE NEED TO FILL MORE POSITIONS CHRONICALLY UNDERSTAFFED AND CONTRACTING OUT IS CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM TWENTY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO MAINTAIN POSITIONS -- PROTECTS NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS THAT ARE BEING EVALUATED AND HOW EFFECTIVE THAT EVALUATION IS TWENTY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN ASSIST. AND PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE WHERE WERE WELCOME TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. HI ADRIENNE MOM AND WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS -- OUR COLLEAGUE THAT ASK ME TWENTY SIX TWENTY I THINK LAID IT OUT PRETTY CLEARLY SO I'M NOT GONNA TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS IS REALLY NOT THE BEST FIT AND EVEN A COUPLE. YEARS BACK WE WERE RUNNING A BILL THAT. DID EXACTLY WHAT -- THIS BUDGET IS TRYING TO DO RIGHT CALLING A A SEPARATE -- PANEL SO TO SPEAK FOR THIS TYPE OF EVALUATION BECAUSE REALLY IT IS NECESSARY IN AS STATED BEFORE WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ALL OF THIS TIME AND RESOURCE AND ENERGY. AWAY FROM OUR PATIENTS AND TREATMENT WHEN IT CAN BE DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE RIGHT IT'S A THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. CO WITH HIS IDEA WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AS IT IS AND WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS A DOCTOR WARM AND DEPARTMENT AND DR WARBURTON AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU KNOW TO US YOU KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE A IS A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA AND WE WERE ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL THAT -- YOU A PT AUTHORED WAY BACK WHEN SO WE WE JUST LIKE TO SEE THIS PROPOSAL GO FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO WHITE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT NO JUST A COMMENT -- AND I WAS A TEACHER AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE YOU KNOW I I WOULD TEACH TO THE PAPER INSTEAD OF TREATING THE PAPER. AND IT'S CRITICAL I WAS FRUSTRATED WITH IF -- WAS THAT WHEN WE WOULD SEND INFORMATION TO THE DISTRICT OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE AND I HAD -- EXTRA STUDENTS THEY WOULD SEND BACK A SOLUTION YOU CAN HAVE TWENTY POINT FIVE KIDS ARE THIRD ACTUALLY THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE KIDS IN YOUR CLASSROOM AND THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE KIDS AND THE OTHER CLASSROOM -- DEALT WITH SPREAD SHEET WAS PERFECT EXCEPT WHICH KATE WAS I COULD NOT CUT OUT. TO SPLIT -- BITE THE ACTUAL PAPER -- AND THE POLICIES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT OF YOU KNOW FINANCIAL GURUS IF YOU WELL -- LOOK GREAT ON PAPER BUT THEY DON'T FUNCTION IN REALITY AND THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE TIME TO GO VISIT ONE OF THE HOSPITALS AND I CAN SEE WHERE. WHERE THAT -- PROPOSAL THAT THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE IS FOR ME MORE MORE HELPFUL BECAUSE I YOU WANT TO PROTECT. OUR COMMUNITIES AND IF WE DON'T HAVE PATIENTS ARE BEING TREATED INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE PAPERWORK WE'RE GOING TO NOT DO AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF OF TREATING THESE PATIENTS -- I APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO IT IN AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT SOMETHING ON PAPER IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE PRACTICAL USE OF WHATEVER. HI -- INFORMATION YOU'RE PROVIDING THANK YOU [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS SO. NO ME START WITH L. LIKE THE IDEA THE PROPOSAL. YOU GUYS ON A MILITARY GUY AND WHEN WE GO AND EVALUATE. OTHER UNITS YES AND OTHER PEOPLE AND TO GO OF VALUE WITH THE UNITS BECAUSE TIONS AND OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. THEY COME AND THEY TAKE A LOOK. THEY DO THE RIGHT UP. TALK TO THE COMMAND AND THEN MOVE FORWARD ONE IT ENSURES THAT. THE PEOPLE. IN THOSE POSITIONS ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME DOING OTHER THINGS MORE IN ABOUT OKAY WHAT DO I GET A TRAINED ALL OF THIS OTHER THINGS BECAUSE ONE THEY SHOULD ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KNOWING. BUT TO IT ALSO INSURE SOME QUALITY CONTROL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE DOING THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SO AS AND EVALUATOR COMES IN. ONE THEIR ENSURING THAT. THE PERSON THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB CORRECTLY AND WHERE THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO IN THIS CASE. WE WOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT. OUR FRIENDS ARE PSYCHIATRISTS WOULD BE. ON POINT IN DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING CELL ONE THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL HOLIDAY. IN THE QUALITY CONTROL OF THEIR ACTIONS IS BEING LOOKED AT AS WELL AS THAT OF THE PATIENT SO YOU KIND OF GET A TWO FOR IN THAT. ON SO I LIKE IT AND IT MAKES SENSE. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL. MAY IF I ADD THIS UP. WITHIN THREE YEARS WE NEED -- NINETY FOUR POINT SIX ALTHOUGH HEAD ROUND THAT UP TO A NINETY FIVE IN THREE YEARS -- BUT ALSO HAVE THAT WITHIN THE US WE'RE ONLY GETTING ABOUT -- IS ONLY SIXTY SIX WHAT'S A YEAR. WITH ONLY SIXTEEN FINISHING A YEAR. AND SO WITHIN THREE YEARS A GIVES US FORTY EIGHT US WIDE. SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE GET IN LICENSE AT THIS LEVEL. IN ORDER TO DO THIS WHICH GOES INTO THE GREATER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE OF NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS NOT ENOUGH NURSES EVERYTHING ELSE -- HASHTAG WE NEED MORE UC'S AND THE SOUTH VALLEY -- BOUGHT. IT'S THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS WE JUST DON'T HAVE. THE TRAIN BODIES TO DO THIS. AND AND TELL A FIX THE PROBLEM OR NOT HAVE IN A FEW CITIES. AND ENOUGH PROGRAMS INCREASING THOSE BUDGETS AS WELL -- I DON'T KNOW I DON'T SEE HOW WE GET THERE IN THAT TIME FRAME -- EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPEN. IF IF I COULD PERHAPS -- AGAINST YOUR QUESTION I'M. AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT AND MOST OF THE POSITIONS PROPOSED OUR SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALISTS AND THE THE THE THE SIXTY SIX LOSSES WERE SINCE THESE AS LIKE. PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY IF -- AND A SO IT'S IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POOL -- AND WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THE SAME DIFFICULTY HIRING -- THE A PSYCHOLOGIST -- DISCIPLINE AS WE HELP WITH THE PSYCHIATRY DISCIPLINE. THAT'S A GOOD THING TO HEAR POST -- BACKLOGS SONG. ANYWAY I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING. MORE OF THIS IS A MOVES FORWARD INTO TALKING WITH THE DIRECTORS MORE -- LATER ON AS THIS MOVES FORWARD BUT IT'S AGAIN I LIKE THE PROPOSAL IT MAKES SENSE AND ENSURES QUALITY CONTROL AND PATIENT CARE ON BOTH ENDS SO. I DO LIKE THOSE ASPECTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. WITHOUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THE TO AGENCY AS WELL KNOWING THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE DO WHAT WE DO BEST WHICH OFTENTIMES IS TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS HANDS THOSE WHO HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO TESTIFY AND WORK WITHIN FRIENDS X. -- BOZELL THAT'S BEFORE US AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE FOR SO FOR THIS ISSUE I'M JOINED BY JOHN ABOUT -- HAS A CHIEF OF OUR FISCAL IN PROGRAM RESEARCH UNIT. SO FOR THIS A PROPOSAL REQUESTING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE NURSING POSITIONS AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT THE WORKLOAD OF PROVIDING TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSING SERVICES AT OUR FIVE HOSPITALS. THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR TEMPORARY HELP POSITIONS AND FIFTY IT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS AT THE POSITIONS NO FUNDING. TO IMPLEMENT THE STAFFING STANDARDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE STAFFING STUDY. AS WITH THE PREVIOUS STAFFING STUDY THE STAFFING STANDARDS PROPOSED ARE BASED ON DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED IN RESEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY MISS LOUDER STEAM. AND WAS DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE RESEARCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RESEARCH ANALYSIS UNIT THROUGH THEIR MISSION BASED REVIEW PROCESS. AS WELL AS WE CONTRACTED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF IRVINE TO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION OF THE DATA AND THE METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS STOPPING STUDY. CURRENTLY WERE BUDGETED FOR NURSING STAFFING RATIOS FAR CUTE IN SKILLED NURSING -- UNITS FOUR AM AND PM SURE SHIFTS AT ONE TO SIX AND FOR NOXIOUS AT ONE TO TWELVE AND FOR INTERMEDIATE UNITS AT ONE TWO EIGHT FOUR AM AND PM AND ONE TO TWO SIXTEEN FOR KNOCK. THESE RATIOS ARE THE MINIMUM NURSING STAFFING STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR LICENSING COMPLIANCE HOWEVER. DUE TO THE PSYCHIATRIC IN SEE EACH PATIENTS. THE PILOT IN THE VIOLENCE RISK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PATIENTS ARE ACTUAL NURSING STAFFING THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE UNITS AS IT'S HIGHER THAN THESE RATIOS. THE STAFFING CITY THROUGH AS CATEGORIZED OUR HOSPITAL TREATMENT UNITS INTO LIKE GROUPS BASED ON VARIABLES THAT DRIVE THE STAFFING LEVELS -- SUCH AS TREATMENT TYPE AND COMMITMENT TIGHT. AND YOU SIX MONTHS OF ACTUAL STAFF DELIVER DATA. TO CALCULATE SYSTEM RIGHT STAFF AND PATIENT RATIOS FOR EACH OF THE GROUPS TO BE USED IN PLACE OF THESE CURRENT MINIMUM RATIOS. SEVEN THERE WAS ALSO TO ADDITIONAL UNIT BASED STAFFING PROPOSALS THAT WERE PART OF THIS I'M STOPPING STUDY THE FIRST IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS INCLUDING RELIEF TO STAFF. TWELVE HOUR EXCUSE ME TWELVE OUR MEDICATION REIMPOSE ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT UNITS. IN THIS IS TO BE PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR MEDICATION PASS. MEDICATION PASS OCCURS FOUR TIMES A DAY ACROSS ALL OF OUR UNITS IT MAY LAST UP TO TWO HOURS PER PASS. THE FUNCTIONS INCLUDE PREPARING ADMINISTERING DOCUMENTING AND ULTIMATELY MANAGING THAT MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION TO THE PATIENTS. AND THE MEDICATIONS OR STORE MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED FROM EITHER A MEDICATION ROOM ON EACH UNIT OR BROUGHT TO THE PATIENT -- AT BAY IT BAD SIDE DEPENDING ON THE MOBILITY AND ACUITY OF THE PATIENTS IN THE UNIT. THE MEDICATION PASSED REQUIRES A LICENSE I COULD A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN A REGISTERED NURSE TO BE FULLY DEDICATED TO THIS FUNCTION. IN ADDITION THERE TO THE ONE DEDICATED STAFF MEMBER DURING THE ACTUAL MEDICATION PASSED THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE THAT IS PULLED FROM THE FLOOR TO HELP WITH THAT HOUSE. CURRENTLY OUR PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO THE MEDICATION ROOMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COUNT OF NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AND DELIVERED STAFF. THIS MEANS THAT THEY'RE PART OF THAT FLOOR RATIO THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE. THE REQUESTED TO PULL THIS RESOURCE AS A STE SEPARATE STANDARDS ST STE -- STANDALONE POSITION SINCE THE MEDICATION ROOM DUTIES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND AND MAKE THIS PERSON ON AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH THE POOR CARE DUTIES. THES NEW MEDICATION ROOM POSTER PROPOSES TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS AND WE CONTINUE TO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW WE EVALUATE WHETHER THESE TWELVE OUR POSTS ARE SUFFICIENT. THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS I'M PROPOSAL IS UNIT SUPERVISION AT OUR HOSPITALS AND IT REALLY IS FOR FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE SUPERVISING REGISTERED NURSE POSITIONS INCLUDING RELIEF. TO STAFF ADDITIONAL TWELVE OUR POSTS PROVIDE ON SITE SUPERVISION FOR THE PM A NOXIOUS OUR HOSPITALS. THESE POSITIONS THAT WILL ALSO BE PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. CURRENTLY THE UNIT SUPERVISORS AND SUPERVISING REGISTERED NURSES SERVES AS THE FIRST LINE SUPERVISORS ON ARE YOU A PATIENT UNITS WITH ONE ALLOCATED PER UNIT. THE SUPERVISORS WORK FIVE DAYS PER WEEK -- AN EIGHT HOUR SHIFT HOWEVER THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT AND STAFF SUPERVISION OF THEIR UNIT ON A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BASIS. SO WELL THEIR SHIFT LEADS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH OF OUR UNITS THE SHIP LEAVES ARE NOT SUPERVISORY LEVEL POSITIONS IS OUR POSITIONS ARE USUALLY STAFF OF SENIOR PSYCH PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS ARE REGISTERED NURSES. SO CURRENTLY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUPERVISORY LEVEL POSITION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE HOSPITAL AT NIGHT. DURING THE TIMES WHEN THE UNIT SUPERVISORS ARE NOT ON SITE. SUCH AS THIS PM AND MARK CHEFS THE HOSPITAL USES AN OFF SITE ON CALL PROGRAM OFFICER OF THE DAY TO PROVIDE THE SUPERVISION AND COVERAGE. AND THIS ON BECAUSE TIME IS ROTATED AMONGST THE VARIOUS SUPERVISORY LEVEL POSITIONS SUCH AS UNIT SUPERVISORS PROGRAM DIRECTORS NURSING COORDINATORS AND SURPRISING OUR ENDS. THESE ON CALL MEMBERS ARE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT -- TO TO HANDLE VARIOUS TO THOSE LAWS TO ADD SEVENTEEN TWELVE HOURS SUPERVISORY -- POSTS ACROSS THE FIVE HOSPITALS TO COVER THE PM ANOXIOUS WHICH WILL EXPAND THE ON SITE SUPERVISOR COVERAGE FROM EIGHT HOURS TO TWENTY HOURS PER DAY. AND THIS WILL THEN PROVIDE A THREE TO FOUR SUPERVISORS PERHAPS BOTTLE AT A RATIO OF ONE TO FORTY STAFF. AND THIS IS AN INITIAL CONSERVATIVE NUMBER I'M ESTIMATE OF THE ERRORS -- SUPERVISORY NEED AS WE BRING THESE MANAGERS THE SUPERVISORS ON BOARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT NEED AND THEIR WORKLOAD. IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL UNIFACE POSITIONS AS RESULT OF THE STAFFING STUDY THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR TEMPORARY HEALTH POSITIONS ARE TO INCREASE OUR TEMP HELP WITH ALREADY TO OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVELS IN ORDER TO MEET THE DELIVERED STAFFING LEVELS. AND WE USE THAT PRIMARILY USE THE TEMPER HELP POSITIONS FOR OUR NURSING REGISTRY. AND THEN WE ARE HAVE POSITION AUTHORITY FOR FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS IN THIS IS WE HAVE A TO FILL FIFTY JOBS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY NURSING CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE. POSITIONS. AND SO IN ORDER TO RE DIRECT THIS FOR FIFTY NURSING -- POSITIONS BACK TO THE FLOOR WE ARE REQUESTING THE POSITION SO THAT WE CAN MEET THAT STAFFING NEEDS AND THEN USE THOSE NURSES TO HELP OFFSET OVERTIME -- THE PROPOSAL ALSO -- INCLUDES REALIGNING STAFFING RESOURCES ACROSS THE HOSPITALS TO MEET THE STAFFING LEVELS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE STUFFING STUDY. HAPPY TO TAKE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LIVE. ON THE SO I A WILL WILL TAKE THE PROPOSAL THERE'S VARIOUS PARTS FIRST I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STAFFING STANDARDS -- WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSED STAFFING STANDARDS THE CREATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOW -- TEMPORARY HELP POSITIONS THE DEDICATED BUDGET FOR OVERTIME AND THE FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF WHO WOULD TAKE ON DUTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY NURSES REALLY REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WE NOTE THAT THE CREATION OF SIMILAR TYPE STAFFING STANDARDS IS SOMETHING OUR OFFICE IS RECOMMENDED IN THE PAST AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE A SAID A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD -- THE ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER IS THAT IT WOULD PUT IN PLACE CURRENT PRACTICE LEVEL A STAFFING STANDARDS AS OPPOSED TO STAFFING STANDARDS THAT ARE NECESSARILY OPTIMAL. WELL THE DEPARTMENT DID WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. TO VERIFY THAT THEIR METHODOLOGY ACT -- ACCURATELY DELIVER -- OF STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED -- IT DID NOT ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS ARE ACTUALLY OPTIMAL IN FACT THE STUDY NOTED THAT IT COULD RESULT IN SUBOPTIMAL STAFFING AND RECOMMENDED THAT DEPARTMENT. REVIEW IT STAFFING STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE STAFFING STANDARDS NOW AND ALL THE ASSOCIATED ADJUSTMENTS WITH THOSE. BUT THAT IT DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT -- TO ENGAGE WITH AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL STAFFING ANALYSIS. AND SPECIFICALLY THAT ANALYSIS WOULD INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S CLINICAL STOPPING BOTH FOR NURSING. AND NON NURSING STAFF. NON NURSING CLINICAL STAFF I SHOULD SAY IT WOULD INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER AND TYPE OF CLINICAL STAFF. NECESSARY TO PROVIDE TREATMENT IN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER MORE TASK COULD BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER LOWER CLASS COST CLINICIANS OR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS UTILIZING IT STAFF AS FOR THE EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE AND WE ESTIMATE THAT AN ANALYSIS LIKE THIS COULD COST IN THE LOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICATION ROOM STOPPING WE DO THINK IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT MERITS CONSIDERATION HOWEVER. THE DEPARTMENT WASN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA SHOWING CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE NEED TO PULL STAFF FOR MEDICATION PASS RESULTS AND NEGATIVE PATIENT OUTCOMES LAKE INCREASES IN VIOLENCE. AND GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RESORT I THINK A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO PILOT -- ADDITIONAL STAFF SPECIFICALLY WE'D RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE STAFF WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO STAFF TWENTY FOUR MEDICATION ROOMS FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. AND THAT IT REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT ON THE FACT THAT THESE ADDITIONAL STAFF HAVE ON PATIENT OUTCOMES AND VIOLENCE. FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT SUPERVISORS WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT A SUPERVISOR HAS TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THOSE PROPOSALS THAT THOSE POSITIONS. THANK YOU SIR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU -- WE'D SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL -- THAT'S THAT'S BEFORE YOU I'M. WE FEEL THAT -- THAT THE VALIDATION BY UC IRVINE -- AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT OF OUR MISSION BASED REVIEW -- PROCESS -- HAS TAKEN A DEEPER LOOK THEN PERHAPS -- IT WOULD DO -- AND WHAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED AT WITH THE YOU KNOW WITH JUST THAT THE DEPARTMENT. BY ITSELF HOWEVER THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DONE REALLY CANNOT BE -- OVERSTATED THEY'VE THEY'VE WORKED VERY HARD BUT TOGETHER QUITE A LOT OF DATA. AND I'M PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS -- THE NEED TO CONNECT YOU KNOW CONTINUALLY REFINE -- THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE AND I THINK THESE RESOURCES ARE A FIRST STEP AND WOULD PUT -- WHAT PUT REALLY MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT? AND THEY HAVE A VEHICLE AND TO REPORT THAT INFORMATIONALREADY THROUGH THEIR ANNUAL -- FALL ESTIMATE PROCESS AND I AM SO WE'D. YOU KNOW WELL WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- IT ISN'T PERFECT AND WE DO THINK THAT -- THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO FROM THE STARTING PLACE -- IT FOR THE MEDICATION ROOMS -- THIS WAS SOMETHING AGAIN THAT I THAT I LEARNED FROM OBSERVATION WATCHING THE STAFF AND THE MEDICATION ROOM AND YES THE MEDICATION PASS ITSELF AS A TWO HOUR PROCESS POTENTIALLY. BUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK BEFORE AND AFTER THAT THE DOCUMENTATION TRANSPORTATION INVENTORY ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF ASSOCIATED -- EFFORTS WAS EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT -- AND THERE IT OF COURSE THEY THEY HAVE THE THE MEDICATION ROOM STAFFERS AND HAS THE KEYS TO THE MEDICATION ROOM AND SO IF THEY'RE LEAVING THE MEDICATION ROOM THEIR PROCESSES THAT HAVE TO TAKE PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PHARMACEUTICALS ARE -- ARE SAFE AND AND NOT ACCESSIBLE TO PATIENTS WHY AND SO IF IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT THAT -- THAT WE FELT WAS IT WAS VERY SUPPORTABLE -- IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR ALLOCATION OF STAFFING AND REALLY. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY CONSERVATIVE AS WELL -- AND AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'LL HELP ON THANKS THANK YOU. WILL COMMENT ON ISSUE. FOR COR SAID TO SAY SOMETHING BUT THIS COULD BE PRESIDING WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE ABSOLUTELY A 100% SUPPORTER OF BEHIND -- THE DEPARTMENTS -- BUT YOUR REQUEST FOR NURSING STAFF -- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT FOR YEARS ABSOLUTELY YEARS AND IT'S MAKES ME FEEL WONDERFUL TO SEE THAT WE'RE FINALLY GETTING. OUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF APPROVE -- RECOGNIZED IN THE BUDGET -- WE HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY UNDERSTAFFED FOR THE PATIENT POPULATION THAT HE HAVE SERVED OR HAVE BEEN SERVING. YOU KNOW THE PATIENT POPULATION THAT ARE RATIOS ARE SET UP FOR WAS FROM A MODEL FROM BACK IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE PATIENT POPULATION WAS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT IS NOW WE'RE NOW SERVING 90% FRIENDS IT COMMITMENTS -- YOU KNOW. THIS IS JUST A WHOLLY DIFFERENT PERSON THAT WE ARE NOW SERVING -- ADDITIONALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DEPARTMENTS. LAST YEAR WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED ASSAULTS ON STAFF. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER BUT THAT IS DOWN FROM FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY TEN THAT IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT WE'VE MADE HUGE STRIDES IN THIS DEPARTMENT WE'VE INCREASED SLOWLY AND SURELY THE STAFFING. A LITTLE BY LITTLE TO GET TO THE FINALLY WHERE WE ARE NOW -- UNFORTUNATELY THE THE STAFFING LEVELS ARE. NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN -- JUST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN PSYCH TAX THERE'S THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SAKE TAX AT THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS THEY WORKED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOURS OF OVERTIME. OF WHICH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS WERE INVOLUNTARY OVERTIME. THIS PROPOSAL RAY HERE WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE. THE MANDATORY OVER OVER TIME PORTION. SO WE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE THAT THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND. THE ONE THING. BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY FATHOM AS WHEN YOU'RE WE HAVE WORKING AT A STATE HOSPITAL IN YOUR WORKING WITH VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE. YOU GO TO WORK AT SIX FORTY FIVE YOU'VE HAD A REALLY ROUGH DAY YOU'VE BEEN ASSAULTED BY A PATIENT YOU'RE ABOUT READY TO WALK OUT THE DOOR. AND THEN YOU GET TAPPED ON THE WORK ANOTHER EIGHT HOUR SHIFT. YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT OF PACKED ENOUGH FOOD. YOU MAY NOT HAVE ARRANGED FOR CHILD CARE YOU'RE LEFT SCRAMBLING I KNOW AS A FATHER OF A SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HARD -- YOU MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH SLEEP I MEAN HOW CAN YOU GET ENOUGH SLEEP TO WORK A SIXTEEN HOUR SHIFTS BUT STILL YOU MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH SLEEP. TO HANDLE THAT. SO THEN I WANT TO PUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT TO THE SIDE OF WHAT THE LA -- SAYING AND GET UP KIND OF A PICTURE THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS THIS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEDICATION ROOM. A PSYCH TECH IS INSIDE THE MEDICATION ROOM FOR ROUGHLY EIGHT HOURS A DAY. AND WHEN AN ALARM GETS PULLED MEDICATION ROOM AND GO HELP OUT YOUR FELLOW SAKE TECH OR YOUR FELLOW NURSE OR YOUR FOLLOW DR. IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE SO TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COUNT DOES NOT SEEM REASONABLE -- SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT I'VE MISSED. YEAH WE WE WE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR FINALLY -- FOR FINALLY KIND OF LIVING UP TO THE LITTLE HOOVER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LITTLE HOOVER'S. REPORT -- THAT RECOMMENDED AB 50% REDUCTION IN OVERTIME. AND ABANDON MANDATORY OVERTIME ALTOGETHER AND BY THE WAY THAT'S WHAT IT AB FIVE TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST WOULD TOO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU COMMITTEE RATHER CHAIR ON A BILL JOHNSON PRESIDENT OF LOCAL TWENTY SIX TWENTY WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL. UNDERSTANDING THAT -- WE ARE MEMBER SERVICE PART OF IT THE TREATMENT TEAM -- AS ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE LEVEL OF CARE SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND IMPACTS OUR STAFF AS WELL AS WELL AS ME ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND PHARMACY HOSPITALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ADRIN MOHAMMED WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE OUR SUPPORT -- FOR OUR SITE TENGAN NURSE COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE WILL START WITH DOCTOR WOULD FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS. IT'S JUST A QUESTION SO THE INCREASE IN THE NURSING STAFF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THERE'S THESE ARE THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL RANK AND FILE NURSE. CORRECT OR IS IT I'M I'M TRY I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR WORKFORCE A LITTLE BETTER YEAH SO THE THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS IS OUR OUR FIRST LINE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITION SO THESE ARE THE POSITIONS THAT. ARE ON THE FLOOR THAT DO PROVIDE AS TO THE PATIENTS [inaudible] IS THERE. THE ASSUMING THIS WAS PASSED YOU KNOW AND AND AND SIGNED INTO LAW. IS THERE THE WORK FORCE OUT THERE TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR RIGHT NOW GOOD QUESTION. I'M ACTUALLY WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PROPOSAL FURTHER ON THE AGENDA THAT WILL HELP US ACHIEVE THESE NUMBERS AS WELL. FROM FROM IT I HAD TO INCREASE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO PRODUCE MORE I PSYCHIATRIC CASH TO TECHNICIAN POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS NEED. OKAY I JUST. WONDER ABOUT WORKFORCE I KNOW THAT NURSES ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY AND SO AND THESE ARE SPECIALIZED IS A SPECIALIZED CARE. IS PROBABLY NOT FOR EVERYONE AS WELL SO ON I WE SEE THIS NUMBER OF POSITIONS I I WONDER YOU KNOW IF. YOUR ABILITY TO TO FILL THEM AND ALSO RETAIN OVER THE LONG HAUL SO HOW IS THERE IS ARE DO YOU HAVE ATTENTION ISSUES. WELL ACTUALLY IF I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS IN THE NEED JUST KIND OF IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE THE ELLIE OWES A IT PROPOSAL AS WELL AS JUST THIS RETENTION AND THAT OF OUR STAFF. AND JUST TO CUTTING FIRST WILL GIVE A PICTURE OF OUR UNITS -- THE THE PEOPLE HAVEN'T THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE TREAT PATIENTS FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE WE SAY WE ARE FRIENDS THAT HOSPITAL PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THINK OF CORRECTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND THAT WE HAVE -- THE IN INDIVIDUAL CELLS OR IT MIGHT HAVE CELLS ARE NOT CELLS THEY ARE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENTS THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT THE UNIT TO THE DOORS LOCKED BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE THE THE UNIT IS VERY MUCH A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. WITH -- AND THEY'RE VERY LARGE UNIT SO WE HAVE UNITS THAT ARE THAT RUN. UPWARDS OF FIFTY SIXTY PATIENTS ON THE UNIT AND WE TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND HAVE BY HI VIOLENT RISK AND MANY OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE SERVE. COULD NOT BE SAFELY TREATED AT TWO IN THE COMMUNITY SO WHEN YOU GET THESE VERY CONCENTRATED -- LEVELS OF OF STAFF OF PATIENTS ON THESE UNITS WHO HAVE VERY SO -- SIGNIFICANT ACUITY IS IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT AND I IN THAT THAT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY ARE ARE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS EVERY DAY -- PUT PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISKTO TREAT AND CALIFORNIA'S MOST -- SEVERE POP AS SAY SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION -- I WILL JUST SAID IT TO KIND OF SPEAK TO THE RETENTION OF OUR STAFF IT'S DIFFICULT THEY DO GET INJURED YOU HEARD MR PATAKI SITE -- THE THE NUMBERS OF INCIDENTS ON OUR UNITS -- AROUND TWENTY ENTER IN IT INCIDENTS AT PACE ON STAFF ISLAND SIX THREE YEAR BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE THREE THOUSAND PATIENT TO PATIENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND OUR NURSES ARE OFTEN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO THESE INCIDENTS WHEN THEY POINT SPOKE ABOUT PULLING THE TAGS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT FIRST IF YOU A SENSE OF THE I AM A FOR RETENTION PURPOSES WE WE LOSE A LOT OF STAFF TO INJURY. THAT'S THE THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES -- THE WORKERS COMPENSATION WE THAT WE DID A COMPARISON OF OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION OFF FOR YOU I AM OFF WORK RATE COMPARED TO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND THE NUMBER OF STAFF -- OFF WORK ON WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR EVERYONE HUNDRED STAFF FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BECAUSE HE STAFF AT CDC OUR INSTITUTIONS AVERAGE RATE OF THREE POINT ONE EIGHT STAFF OFF WORK PER. ONE HUNDRED WELL OUR NURSING STAFF AVERAGE FOUR POINT ONE SIX TWO HER FOUR POINT SIX TO HER ONE HUNDRED SO WE ARE NURSING STAFF FOR INJURED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THAT BECAUSE HE STOP AT CORRECTIONS. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CHALLENGE -- IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW WE THIS PROPOSAL THESE -- THREE HUNDRED POSITIONS ARE REALLY TO HELP PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON THE UNIT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH STAFF TO RESPOND TO THOSE. TO THOSE NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS AS WELL AS THE VIOLENCE RISKS THAT CAN THAT THAT OCCUR ON THE ON THE FLOORS AS WELL ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUNS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU KNOW WE VISITED -- OUR LOCAL -- HOSPITAL PENN STATE -- HOSPITAL THAT WAS THERE AND WE WALK THE THE FOR THE INITIAL GATE AND THEN ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT IS PRETTY MUCH OPEN -- WE WALKED IN IN THE IN THE AREA WERE ALL PATIENTS WERE AT AND THERE WAS A A LINE THAT WAS PAINTED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT SAID YOU KNOW PATIENTS DOWN THAT SIDE. AND WE CAN WALK IN BETWEEN THAT'S HELP CLOSE AND AND SECURE IT IS FOR FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE THERE. AND WHEN I WHEN I SEEN THE INTAKE THOSE JUST COMING OUT FROM -- THE BUS AND DOING THE INTAKE THERE WAS NO WALL THERE WAS NO SAFETY FEATURES IT WAS JUST AS GOOD EVEN CLOSER THAN YOU AND I ARE NOW. SO THE SAFETY OF OF THE THE TECHNICIANS THAT ARE THERE AND THEN ALL THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE THERE IT'S IT'S A REAL. DRAMA REAL DILEMMA FOR THEM SO WHEN I SEE THE THE OVERTIME IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BECAUSE AS FAR AS WHERE THE EMPLOYEES ARE EVERYONE HAS TO BE PRETTY MUCH. ON THEIR ON THEIR WITS RIGHT -- TO SEE OF ANY PROBLEMS ARE COMING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. AND WE DID SEE THAT -- THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS ON THE SITE TAX EMPLOYEES THAT ARE THERE. THEY PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN EVERYBODY -- DESTABILIZE THE SITUATION IT'S THEIR ITSELF SO IT TRULY IS A A SITUATION THAT HAVE SOME HAVEN'T TOURED ONE IN THE THE HOSPITALS TO SEE THAT IMPACT IT'S THERE. SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE THESE POSITIONS COMING IN BUT YET -- HEARING IT FROM SOME OF THE SPEAKERS THAT WERE THERE AS FAR AS MANDATORY OVERTIME VERSUS VOLUNTARY DOES THAT PUT MORE. TECHNICIANS OR EMPLOYEES. AT RISK BECAUSE NOW FOR INJURY BECAUSE OF THE THE INTERACTION THAT'S GOING ON THERE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S ITSELF. AND HOW DO YOU. BE ABLE TO START TO ADDRESS THAT AND I KNOW IT AND AND ISSUE FIVE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT AND THOSE TYPES OF DEALS. BUT WE'RE STARTING TO NOW BE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THAT'S IN FRONT OF THE WORK FORCE WITHIN THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE THERE. COULD THOSE SIMPLE DISCUSSION STARTING NOW START TO LOOK AT THE RETENTION DOWN THE ROAD THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT ISSUE AN ISSUE. FIVE OF HOW WE'RE WE'RE RETAINING THOSE INDIVIDUALS THERE. AND I THINK LOOKING AT THE DEDICATED MEDICATION ROOMS THOSE ARE WHEN WE WERE THERE WE WE SEEN THE MEDICATION ROOM AND I THINK. BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT AS YOUR FIRST POINT OF CONTACT BE PROACTIVE KEEPING THOSE MEDS MOVING THROUGH THE HOSPITAL SERVES AS A LINE OF DEFENSE BUT TO THEN COUNT THEM AS RESOURCES A SERRA CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS. AND YET AND SOMEONE DOES PUSH THAT BUTTON AND TO SAY THEY'RE RESPONDING THEY HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT THAT ROOM THAT'S THERE. SO I THINK. LOOKING AT AND SEEN THE BUDGET FOR OVERTIME I'D LIKE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IT IS A TRULY -- VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY MANDATORY OVERTIME THAT'S COMING THERE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE DOES THAT PUT THE INDIVIDUALS -- IN SOME TYPE OF HARM'S WAY BECAUSE THEIR THEIR WITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT NEED TO STILL BE INTACT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING THAT CLOSE TO A POPULATION. SO LOOKING AT THE THE THE OVERTIME THAT'S ASSUMED IN THE PROPOSAL -- AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I'M GOING TO MY MISTAKE THIS -- IT ASSUMES -- ANY AT A 95% VACANCY RATE THAT THE EACH NURSE WOULD IT'S THIRTEEN POINT -- EIGHT AVERAGE AN AVERAGE OF THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT HOURS OF OVERTIME PER MONTH SO THAT'S TO SAY YOU KNOW TWO SHIFTS PER OVER TO PER MONTH HER HER I HAD NURSES WHAT'S ASSUMED IN THE IN THE PROPOSAL. SO WITH THAT ASSUMED IN THE PROPOSAL IS OUT THOSE HOURS. THAT NOW ARE ARE MARK TO THAT POSITION BASED ON MANDATORY OVERTIME OR VOLUNTARY THIS SOMETHING'S WORKED OUT AHEAD OF TIME. WE HEARD SPEAKERS TALK ABOUT -- EMPLOYEES AT THEN HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LUNCH FOR FOR A FAMILY FOR CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON SO ARE THEY ABLE TO PLAN THOSE OUT OR IS IT SOMETHING. THAT HAPPENS THE SAME DAY YES CERTAINLY OUR OUR HOSPITALS PRE HIGHER FOR OVERTIME BECAUSE OVER TIME HAPPENS RIGHT SO SOMEBODY CALLS IN SICK FOR A CHEF WE HAVE -- TO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT COVERAGE AND SO THE HOSPITALS DO AND IT CUT A NUMBER OF THINGS TO TRY TO AVOID MANDATORY OFF. OVER TIME THE FIRST IS TO PRE AYE HIGHER WE CAN YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF OF SHIPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE COVERED IN A DAY. OR A WEEK BASED ON YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE RATES OF OF A SICK YOU KNOW SET CALLS. AND SAID THEY DO PRE HIGHER OVER TIME WE ALSO MAINTAIN A TEMPORARY HELP PULL I'M IN A REGISTRY STRIVE TO ALSO HELP FILL THOSE POSITIONS WE'D BETTER. SO WE DO THE I TRIED WHEN WE GET -- AROUND AREAS OF HOLIDAYS -- OR IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT EVENT GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE THE MID STATE FAIR GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF OF CHALLENGE. OF THOSE TYPES OF TIME FRAMESOF WE DO FIND OURSELVES OFTEN AND MANDATORY OVERTIME SITUATIONS -- SO THIS WILL PROPOSAL DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW SPREAD THOSE OVER TIME -- HOURS ACROSS AS WELL SO BE MORE A A NURSES AVAILABLE TO WORK OVERTIME SHIFTS THE REASON I BRING IT UP IT IS BECAUSE ONE I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE -- BEING THERE THAT IT'S A HIGH RISK HIGH RISK AREA HIGH RISK JOB THOSE THINGS DO HAPPEN -- WHEN I TOURED -- PENN STATE HOSPITAL I SEE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AND PROBABLY. SOME MORE BUT WITHIN TWO WEEKS WHEN I TOURED IT A SITE TECH WAS ATTACKED. SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY I'M SAYING THAT THE SAFETY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TAKE INTO OUR DISCUSSION WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER TIME WHETHER IT'S VOLUNTARY OR MANDATORY. IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THANK YOU. HELLO THE ONE THE ONE THING I WANTED -- TO POINT OUT AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I THINK IN AND ITSELF THIS PROPOSAL WANT NECESSARILY REDUCE MANDATORY OVERTIME THE ONLY WAY MANDATORY OVERTIME WOULD BE REDUCED AS IF THE POSITIONS ARE ACTUALLY FILLED. I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT THAT BY ADDING POSITIONS YOU MIGHT SPREAD MANDATORY OVERTIME OVER MORE PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK IN AND OF ITSELF THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE MUCH FACT THAT. THE MAIN EFFECT WOULD COME FROM THE WORK FOR BECAUSE OF THAT WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT LATER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT'S A THE THE SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON YES THANK YOU [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. RUSSIA QUESTION HOW MANY TIMES WERE. THE FACILITIES AND NOT NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE. TWENTY TWO DO YOU HAVE REPORTS ON THE YEAH I I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE. TWENTY TWO IT WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A NURSING STAFF WE CAN ALSO COUNT OTHER CONDITIONS INTO -- OUR ACCOUNT SO WE WILL BRING IN OUR SUPERVISORS I WILL CALL AND ME I MANAGEMENT -- LICENSE STAFF AND REALISTIC REHAB THERAPISTS AS WELL IN ORDER TO MEET THAT THAT LICENSE. REQUIREMENTS SO DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF CERTIFICATE. SOARED OF SUBJECTS. CERTIFICATE CATION LEVEL TO BE IN THAT POSITION OR IF YOU'RE JUST BACK FILLING WITH BODIES ON WHAT I'M SAYING IS A SAFE LICENSE. SO EVERYBODY'S LICENSE IN THIS. THIS REALM THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN TOTAL TWENTY TWO NO COMPLAINTS NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THANK YOU -- HE THE FEW COMMENTS IF I CAN -- I'M HEARING ECHOES OF THE NURSES WHO I'VE WORKED WITH WHO FELT UNDER RESOURCE AND OVERBURDENED AND WHEN I WENT TO COLIN GUY HEARD MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT. WE ARE HEARING TODAY. I AM -- ECSTATIC ACTUALLY THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BEFORE US BECAUSE IT WILL HELP TO LEAD TOWARDS. ISSUES WITHIN RETENTION FIFTY FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH IN STATE HOSPITALS AND SO. AGAIN -- DO YOU BELIEVE THE LA -- HAS. SOME MERIT LOOKING TOWARDS EVALUATION OF THE STAFFING TO MAKE SURE THAT ADOPTED. THAT THE DIRECTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS LEADING IS APT THE RIGHT STAFFING LEVEL AND SO -- I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK BY ADDING PEOPLE PARTICULARLY I JUST. HAVING WORKED GRAVEYARDS MY WHOLE LIFE AND INSENSITIVE TO THE OVERNIGHT. STAFFING AND SUPERVISORS THAT YOU'LL BE ADDING -- AND KNOW THAT -- WITH THAT WE TWO FOUR OKAY WE'RE REQUESTING EIGHT PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY GROWING TO TWO POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AN ON GOING. AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY EXPAND RESOURCES FOR FOR NURSING RECRUITMENT AT THREE OF OUR HOSPITALS. WE EXPERIENCED RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES FOR SAY A PSYCHIATRY AND LEVEL OF KERR STOP WILL ALL OF OUR CLINICAL STAFF REALLY -- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE IS OF WHAT WE JUST SPOKE AROUND ABOUT OUR HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENTS -- BUT THE CUTIE OF OUR PATIENTS AND THE PATIENT VIOLENCE TOWARD STAFF THE CLINICAL AND LEVEL CARE POSITIONS ARE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY DEMANDING POSITIONS IN OUR HOSPITALS. WE ALSO. HAVE HIGHER OCCUPANCY IN CASELOADS WITHIN OUR HOSPITALS AND TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES WE'VE BEEN OPERATING IT NEARLY MAXIMUM FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY BEST STANDARDS. YEAH YOU HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- WE HAVE -- I APOLOGIZE I JUST LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT GET THE GOVERNMENT HERE -- LET ME MOVE ON ACCORDING TO EXISTING RESEARCH -- OCCUPANCY LEVEL IN THE HOSPITALS -- ABOVE 80% LEADS TO STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENTS AND FURTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE OPERATING ABOVE 85% OCCUPANCY WILL HAVE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT AT THE IMPACTS TO HOSPITAL FOR PERFORMANCE SUCH AS STAFF DISSATISFACTION. BURN OUT MEDICATION ERRORS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR A BY PATIENTS AMONG OTHER ISSUES. AND THEN LOOKING AT DATA FROM THE WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC STATE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHICH IS LIKE A COALITION OF STATE HOSPITALS THAT WE ARE A PART OF IN THAT REPRESENTS BEEN DOES THE AVERAGE EVERY SHIFT PSYCHIATRIST TO PATIENTS -- FOR FOR A PROCESS HOSPITALS WAS ONE TO TWENTY FIVE MONTHS MEMBERS AND WE RUN IT I ONE TO THIRTY FIVE OR IN INTERMEDIATE CASELOADS. A THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT NATIONAL -- SHORTAGES OF BOTH PSYCHIATRISTS AND ON THE NURSES AS WELL THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH STATES THAT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE AGING OUT OF THE WORK FORCE. ARE AGE FIFTY OR OLDER AND 39% OF PSYCHIATRISTS OR SIXTY ONE OR OLDER. AND PURSE WERE NURSES ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE IS MAINTAINED CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A DEFICIT OF FORTY FOUR THOUSAND OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND NURSES BY. TWENTY THIRTY WE ALSO HAVE A PAGE CHALLENGES -- IN AND OTHER EMPLOYER COMPETITION THEIR PAIN AND PAY AYE INEQUITIES BETWEEN IDEA SAGE -- AND OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS NAMELY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS DUE TO A FEDERAL COURT ORDER SO OUR CLINICAL STAFF. DO MAKE 5% LESS THAN -- CDC OUR STAFF. AS WELL AS HEALTHCARE FACILITIES -- IN THE COMMUNITY PAY MORE THAN THAT IS THAT A STATE POSITIONS. TO SO WE PROPOSED TO PARTNER WITH TORO UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP AN EMPLOYER CONSORTIUM COMPRISED OF OURSELVES TUROW IN AS WELL AS TO ADDITIONAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE A NEW PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM -- THIS WOULD INCLUDE HIRING A PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND A PROGRAM ASSISTANT TO ESTABLISH THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM TO COLLABORATE WITH FURROW -- AND THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION DEVELOP CURRICULUM IN CLINICAL ROTATIONS AND PROCEED WITH THE MATCH PROCESS TO PLACE RESIDENTS. THE GOAL IS TO OPEN THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM ANYONE TO ITS FIRST COHORT OF FOR RESIDENTS AND ADDING AN ADDITIONAL FOUR RESIDENTS ON GOING FOR EACH YEAR THE PROGRAM UNTIL THERE ARE SIXTEEN RESIDENTS IN THE PROGRAM PERSON ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. WITH FOR COMPLETING THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR BEGINNING IN. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WELL IN THE ROTATION AT DSA H. -- NAPA THE RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PATIENT CASELOAD AND WILL BE ACTIVELY TREATING PATIENTS AT THE DEPARTMENT. REYES AND CREATING THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM DAYTON DEDICATED TO TRAINING PRESS GRADUATES AND FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH WILL HELP DEVELOP A COHORT OF PSYCHIATRISTS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH OUR PATIENT POPULATION. THIS ONLY -- THE ANNUAL COST OF THE RESIDENTS WHICH IS 300-990-00600 DOLLARS PER YEAR BEGINNING IN YEAR TWO WILL BE LESS THAN THE COST OF HIRING ONE FULL TIME PSYCHIATRIST WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SO IT'S A VERY COST EFFECTIVE PROPOSAL FOR US. WITH RESPECT TO THE NURSING INSTRUCTORS -- NO TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT WE WILL FOR INSTITUTION CODE SECTION FORTY TWO FORTY THREE TWENTY REQUIRES US TO ESTABLISH AN EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF A PSYCHIATRIC. TO TECHNICIANS FOR HOSPITALS. AS WE PARTNER WITH AGITATION EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE FOR TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT OF OUR OUR INS IN PT'S. AND IT'S IN SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT ARRANGEMENTS -- WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE LOCATION ON OUR FACILITIES FOR THE TRAINING AS WELL AS NURSING INSTRUCTORS. SO WE PROPOSED A HA HIGHER FIVE NURSE INSTRUCTORS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR IN ST PETE TO CANDIDATES WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THREE WOULD BE FOR ATASCADERO WORTH ONE AT THE S. H. NAPA FOR A PARTNER SAID SHIP WITH NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE AND ONE IDEAS THAT EACH COALINGA. FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WEST HILLS COLLEGE THE THE NURSES DOCTORS WILL NOT ONLY BE LIMITED TO THE CURRICULUM BASED -- WORKLOAD BUT THEY WILL ALSO SERVE AS LOCAL HOSPITAL OUT REACH COORDINATORS AS WELL THERE WERE CARL AVERAGE COLLABORATIVELY. WITH OUR RECRUITMENT UNIT SACRAMENTO TO ASSIST IN PARTICIPATION ABOUT THE CANDIDATES OUT REACH -- CAREER FAIRS AND TO BE AMBASSADORS TO DS H. TO PARTNER WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL INDUSTRIES THE QUESTION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LAYOFF. ARMA SO WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM BUT WE DO THINK THAT IT'S A PROMISING APPROACH BECAUSE IT DOES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF SLOTS. HOWEVER WE ARE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED BECAUSE IT IS ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO PRODUCE FOR GRADUATES WHO WANT NECESSARILY BE REQUIRED TO STAY IN THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. ACCORDINGLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT IT BE APPROVED ON A SIX YEAR BASIS THIS WOULD ALLOW ONE COHORT OF STUDENTS TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'D STAY AND THEN AT THAT POINT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DETERMINE. WHETHER THE RETENTION RATE IS HIGH ENOUGH IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM OR WHETHER ON ONLY ENOUGH FUNDS TO ALLOW THE RESIDENTS WERE IN THE PROGRAM -- TO FINISH SHOULD BE APPROVED WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRADUATE MORE NURSES WE THINK IT'S A GOOD STEPPED ON A GOOD A PROVEN WAY. TO REDUCE VACANCIES WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THAT NORMALLY WHEN THESE CLASS SIZES INCREASE THE COLLEGE GET SOME INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- AND WE ARE AWARE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO PROPOSED OFFSET A PORTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WITH SOME OF THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING AS PART OF THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER PROCESS. HOWEVER TWO OF THE INSTRUCTORS THEY'RE NOT SEEKING TO DO THAT FOR AND SO WERE WITHHOLDING RECOMMENDATION JUST PENDING CLARIFICATION OF WHY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO OFFSET MORE OF THE COSTS WITH THIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS IN PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU THE FROM THE FINANCE I THINK YOU I'D AS SO IN TERMS OF THE LIMITING THE THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM TO LIMITED TERM -- AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S EFFECTIVE OR NOT OR NOT -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IMMEDIATELY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE FILLING. POSITIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT -- BEAT IT CURRENTLY FILLED WITH THAT RESIDENTS -- OBVIOUSLY POSITIONS WITH WILL BE AVAILABLE SHOULD A FULL TIME -- YOU KNOW FULLY JOURNEYED -- CLINICIAN BECOME AVAILABLE I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S A IT'S A SUBSTITUTION -- HOWEVER YOU ARE IT EIGHT IMMEDIATELY -- HAVING THE EFFECT OF PROVIDING MORE TREATMENT RIGHT AWAY -- IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY COST OF I'M. A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS ARE FIVE POINT EIGHT SIX WHEN THE RESIDENCY FULLY UP AND RUNNING -- AND THE JUST THAT THAT THE COST OF THE RESIDENTS THEMSELVES OF THE THE STIPEND PORTION IS ONE POINT SIX FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE FIVE POINT -- EIGHT SIX EQUIVALENT POSITIONS AND IF YOU WERE TO HAVE FIVE POINT EIGHT SIX FULL TIME PSYCHIATRIST IT WOULD BE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION SO -- YOU DON'T JUST WITH HAVING STUDENTS PRESENT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE IN THE IN THE CARE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING -- AND IN TERMS OF IT WONDERING HOW HOW EFFECTIVE IT WILL BE AND WHETHER IT FOLKS DECIDE TO STAY OR NOT OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT AND I'VE LEARNED THAT -- FORENSICS IS A SPECIALTY WITHIN PSYCHIATRY THEY'RE ONLY SIXTEEN SLOTS -- THERE WE WOULD BE ADDING SIXTEEN SLOTS TO ONLY TWENTY TWO THAT EXISTING CALIFORNIA SIXTY SIX NATIONWIDE -- AND DOCTOR WARBURTON'S MUCH MORE -- CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THIS THAN I AM BUT I'M FROM MY WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT THOSE WHO CHIU THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT DAY IF THEY WANT TO WORK IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND THOSE ENVIRONMENTS ONLY EXIST AT STATE HOSPITALS AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT JAILS AND CORRECTIONS. ALL OF WHICH THE STATE HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT STUFF SO IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOTS EFFECTIVE I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVERY YEAR COULD MOVE OUT OF STATE BUT THAT'S UNLIKELY -- AND THAT YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT% WE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CARE -- YOU KNOW WE WE THINK AS IT MAKES IT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE PROPOSAL. PUBLIC COMMENT ON PLEASE YES -- IF I MAY ALSO ADD THAT -- TO MAKE IT LIMITED TERM FUNDING WE REDUCE THE INCENTIVE FOR OTHER COLLEGES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM FOR RESIDENTS TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. FIVE CAN KOBE POSSESS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS -- WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND AS FOR THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PORTION OF THIS WE BELIEVE THIS. THE THE AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL -- STAFF TO HOPE THE NURSING PROFESSIONS WERE CREW AND DEVELOP -- MORE CANDIDATES COMING OUT OF THE COLLEGES IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO HOWEVER -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT TIONAL ROADBLOCKS LAKE -- HIGH RENT AREAS IN WHICH SOME OF THE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED LIKE ATASCADERO -- OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILDER PRETTY ISOLATED LIKE KALINGA THOSE ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE DO FIND WE HAVE HIGHER VACANCY RATES -- WE WILL BE GOING TO THE BARGAINING TABLE THIS YEAR AND WE WILL BE ASKING FOR A WERE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STEP IN FOR THOSE AREAS -- SO WE DO HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS LISTENING AS WE PUTFORWARD THERE THE REQUEST FOR A AN ARMED ARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU HAVE BILL JOHNSON PRESIDENT OF ASKED ME LOCAL TWENTY SIX TWENTY WE SENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL -- SPECIFICALLY -- DUE TO THE INCREASE STAFF ASSAULTS THAT ARE OCCURRING -- ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT. NO ONE SPECIFICALLY WERE THOSE ASSAULTS OCCUR AND ON WHICH LEVEL OF CARE CLASSIFICATIONS THEY OCCUR TO IS ALSO IMPORTANCE TO US -- SB THREE SIXTY THREE PANS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT SO WITH THAT WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO AGAIN ADRIN MARKET WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS-- WE ARE DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA AND SOMETHING THAT WE'VE -- BEEN A CONVERSATION WITH THE THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AND SO. WE WE FULLY SUPPORT AND WE AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THIS IS ATTACKING AN ISSUE THAT WHAT IS. IS CURRENTLY BLOSSOMING IT'S SPREADING IT'S GROWING AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN AT THIS POINT TO START TO SLOW THAT DOWN AND CHANGE THE TIDE AND A OF RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST INNOVATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS REGARD AND SO. WE ARE FULLY BEHIND AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND HONESTLY WE THINK IT SHOULD BE EXPANDED WE UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THE THE CONCERNS OF THE LA -- BUT HONESTLY MORE MONEY SHOULD BE PUT TO PORTS THAT MAYBE WE LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR THESE RESIDENTS THAT WAY WE CAN TRY TO HELP INSURE THAT THEY DO. STAY HERE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE WE TO ATTACH SOME TYPE OF WRITER THAT SAYS HEY. YOU SAY FIVE YEARS YOU GET THIS MUCH MONEY TOWARDS LOAN REPAYMENT OR WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE BUT I THINK WE CAN. LOOK TOWARDS WAYS THAT CAN IMPROVE -- EFFICACY BEFORE WE LOOK AT ST. SIX YEARS FROM NOW OKAY WAS THIS ACTUALLY WORTH IT DID THIS WORK WE CAN MAKE THAT. MAKE WE CAN ENSURE THAT WORKS NOW YOU A PD IS PROUD TO BE WITH YOU ALL AS WE LOOK TOWARDS. THE SOLUTION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. MICHAEL BEING A REPRESENT A COMMON CLASS AGAIN I THINK THIS IS THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS A VERY IMPORTANT POSITIVE STEP -- JUST SOME OTHER INFORMATION YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BY UNDERSTANDING IS -- FOR OR ABOUT TO HAVE THE MATCH PROCESS FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL. WAITING FOR THE RESIDENCY PLACEMENTS -- FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL IN AMERICA ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY PLACEMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF RESIDENCY SLOTS TO THE PEOPLE GONE THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEBT. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE NO PLACE. TO BE TRAINED. SO WE NEED MORE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU. AS A DAD THAT PAID FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S PSYCHOLOGY. OF EDUCATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION. AND STARTED OUR FORENSIC PATH AND SO WHAT THE PAY WAS. AND THEN WENT INTO PRIVATE BECAUSE OF SHE'S A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST. SHORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL -- IN SAN DIEGO I THINK THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PAY DISPARITY BETWEEN PRIDE IN PUBLIC -- THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. WHEN WE LOOK IN -- HELP THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S ADVANCED AND IT'S NOT A FAIR ASSUMPTION THAT ANYBODY WANTS TO GO AND MAKE LESS. IN AN INDUSTRY THAT REALLY DOES TAKE A DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL -- MAKING A LIFE BASICALLY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THESE INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW WE KEEP DODGING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. WE DON'T PAY ENOUGH. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADMIRE THESE FOLKS TO TAKE THIS THIS PART OF THE POPULATION. THE NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE DEALINGS WITH WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH CMF AND BACK OF BILL -- WHICH IS ANOTHER SUBSET OF WHAT YOU WOULD WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CRIMINALLY INSANE. NOBODY WANTS TO BE THERE. BUT THE FOLKS THAT YOU WORK WITH. GOD LOVE THEM ARE DOING IT. WE GOT A KNOWLEDGE IF WE WANNA TAKE. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE POPULATION CENSUS GROWING. BUT OUR EMPLOYMENT RATE NOBODY WANTS TO DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH HI MY SOMETHING LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. BUT IT IS IT IS THE TRUTH -- AND AGAIN MY DAUGHTER IS ONE OF THE FOREMOST FACTORS SHE JUST HAS A SOCIETY SHE CAN'T SHE CAN'T -- PRESCRIBE. BUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HER EDUCATION SHE WENT TO A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY. OF NOT TORO BUT SHE WENT TO ALLIANCE. I THINK WE DON'T NEED TO ALIENATE ANY PSYCHOLOGY SCHOOL ALSO WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO ALLOW IN. ANY KIND OF SPECIAL WE CAN GET OF BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SUBSET OF THE SCOPE THAT ANYBODY WANTS. TO JUST JUMP INTO UNLESS THERE'S SOME PUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY -- SO I HOPE WE'VE BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE. AND UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT'S EVEN WITH OUR STAFF HERE IN THE BUILDING. THEY WORK A FEW YEARS AND THEY GO OUT OF HER HOUSE. BECAUSE THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE COMPETITIVE. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THAT IN AND LOOKING TO HAVE A STUDY DONE WHAT'S DISPARITY IN PAY. AND AND IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF A COULD WEEK EQUITY WE CAN BUILD THE WE NEED TO DO THAT. THE COST MONEY BUT WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE A QUALITY OF CARE THAT. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THANK YOU SOME. I HAD MY TWO CENTS AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I STAYED IN THE SAME COUNTY WHERE I DID MY RESIDENCY. BUT TRAINING PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES LEADS TOWARDS THEM WANTING TO STAY. I THINK HISTORICALLY THE DATA IS ABOUT 50% DEPENDING ON THE SPECIALTY. AND EVEN ATTAINING THAT AMOUNT OF IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS SAYING WALL THERE RESIDENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE THEM. AND HAVE THEM STAY LONG TERM IS A STRONG REASON TO MAKE THIS PERMANENT AND NOT ON A LIMITED TERM -- ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE CONCERNS THE ABILITY TO HIRE THE RIGHT PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE WILLING. TO COMMIT TO A PLACE THAT'S ONLY ON A LIMITED TERM VERSUS A LONGER TERM SO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX FOR THIS ITEM I'M JOINED BY A CHRISTINE SAKAKI WHO IS THE S. H. IS TO THAT CHIEF COUNSEL. WE'RE REQUESTING ONE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITION AND A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THREE POINT. THREE FOUR ONE ON GOING. AND APPROVAL OF ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THIS IS TO IMPLEMENT A NEW IN COMPLIANT WAGE STRUCTURE FOR D. S. H. AS VOCATIONAL REHAB PROGRAM THE GOALS OF THIS REQUEST OR TO STANDARDIZE PATIENT WAGE OF STRUCTURE ACROSS ASSOCIATE WITH OUR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM ACROSS OUR STATE HOSPITALS. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND TO REDUCE RISK OF ADVERSE LEGAL ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE A CH IS CURRENT AND NON STANDARDIZED WAGE STRUCTURE. AS PART OF A PATIENT'S TREATMENT PLAN AND REHABILITATION PROCESS WE OFFER OUR PAIN PATIENTS ACCESS TO A VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM SERVES AS A THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF OCCASIONAL SKILLS. AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PATIENTS THE CLINICIANS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE REHAB PROGRAM MANAGERS TO INCORPORATE A TREATMENT PLAN TO ASSIST PATIENTS AND DEVELOPING SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL LIFE AND CAREER SKILLS. PREPARING THE PATIENT FOR DISCHARGE IN OUR TRANSITION TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF CARE AND PROVIDING SKILLS FOR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS ASSISTING WITH SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY INTEGRATION WHEN RELEASED FROM OUR CARE. PATIENTS WORK OPPORTUNITIES I AM VERY ACROSS THE HOSPITALS THEY CAN BE -- JOBS SUCH AS CUSTODIAL A KITCHEN WORKER PRODUCT ASSEMBLY A LAUNDRY ATTENDANT LANDSCAPER PAINTER WE HAVE PLUMBERS BARBERS PARTICLE. HAVE BOOKS WORKING AND HARPER HOLDEN HORTICULTURE -- MULTIMEDIA PRODUCTION AND REPAIR TECHNICIANS. PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE VOCATIONAL REHAB PROGRAM ARE PAID A WAGE FOR THE WORK PERFORMED AND HISTORICALLY THAT PAY STRUCTURE FIRE THAT REHAB PROGRAMS HAS BEEN HAS NOT BEEN STANDARDISED ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS -- WAGE VARIAS VERY ACROSS THE STATE HOSPITALS THEY RANGE FROM A DOLLAR TO TEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS PER HOUR AND ARE NOT CONSISTENT BY THE TYPE OF WORK PERFORMED. NORCROSS THE PATIENT COMMITMENT TYPES. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL IMPLEMENT SPRING PROCESSES AND WAGE STRUCTURES ARE NAPA STATE HOSPITAL OPERATES THE ONLY SHELTERED WORKSHOP AS MAGNOLIA ENTERPRISES -- WERE AUTHORIZED -- TO OPERATE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS BY WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE FORTY THREE SIXTEEN AND THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS ARE DESIGNED PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO PATIENTS THAT MIMIC TRADE IN IN THIS INDUSTRY. I DIDN'T NAPA'S MAGNOLIA ENTERPRISES CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTY VENDORS IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PATIENTS PERFORM WORK THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET AT THE HOSPITAL. SUCH AS A SOW PROPPING BUILDING NURSERY BOXES -- AND ASSEMBLING SMALL ANIMAL FEEDERS. I HAVE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS TO OBTAIN OF FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE SO THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY TO PAY THE PATIENT WORKERS THE HIGHER OF THE FEDERAL OR THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. AND TO PAY SUB STATE MINIMUM WAGE UNDER THE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE NAPA IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TIME STUDIES FOR EACH PATIENT THAT RESULTS IN COMMENSURATE RANGES. AS PART OF THE TIME STUDIES THEY HAVE TO COMPARE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF WORK PERFORMED BY EACH PATIENT TO THAT. OF AN EMPLOYEE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE WAGE FOR THAT EMPLOY A FOR THAT PATIENT. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA DID RAISE CONCERNS TO US REGARDING OUR VOCATIONAL REHAB PROGRAM PARTICULARLY. ARE THE REYES EQUAL PROTECTION ARGUMENTS ARE NOTING THAT THE TYPES OF WORK AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PERFORMED IN THE WAGES RECEIVED DIFFERS BY THE PATIENT TYPE IN ACROSS THE HOSPITALS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD A STOP ASIANS AT SEVEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER HOUR WHICH IS FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. THE PAY WOULD BE APPLIED TO ALL PATIENTS EXCLUDING ARE MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS FROM CDC ARE WHO WILL CONTINUE BE PAID A DOLLAR PER HOUR. AND PATIENTS WORKING IN -- NAPA IS -- THE SHELTERED WORKSHOP UNDER THAT FOURTEEN C. PROGRAM I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED -- THIS WOULD PROVIDE ALSO ONE PERMANENT FULL TIME ASSOCIATE ACCOUNTING ANALYST POSITION AND ASSOCIATED -- IN E. RELATED TO THAT POSITION TO FACILITATE A STANDARDIZED PAYROLL PROCESS ACROSS THE HOSPITALS AS WELL. AND TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED WITHHOLDINGS IN PAYMENT OF EMPLOYER SHARE PAYROLL TAXES THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY AND TAKE CARE OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE -- ALSO INCLUDED PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHICH PROPOSES TO DO TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS TO CLARIFY THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN OUR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND SHELTERED WORKSHOPS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN ALSO CLARIFIES THE APPLICABILITY OF WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS TO OUR PATIENTS -- THE GENDER DID ASK US TO ANSWER OF THREE QUESTIONS SO IF I MAY HOLD FOR C. WITH THOSE. AS PER THE FIRST ONE WAS FOR WHAT REASONS DOES I AM DAZED -- THE DEPARTMENT NOT WANT TO PAY PATIENT WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO UNDER THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW TO OPERATE THE SHOT WORK SHELTER BERKSHIRE THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE. AND IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH HEY SUB MINIMUM WAGE -- WE COULD CREATE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS IN EACH OF THE STATE HOSPITALS AND I'M USING THE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES AND PACE OF MINIMUM AND WAIT A SUB MINIMUM WAGE. BUT IT IS A RESOURCE INTENSIVE AS I MENTIONED IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT WE DO STUDIES OF FOR EVERY PATIENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT WAGE WOULD BE. SO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO PAY FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE IT BOUNCES FACTORS SUCH AS COST AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT MINIMUM WAGE IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE AND WHILE INDIVIDUALS ARE WITH US IN OUR CARE WE DO PROVIDE FOR THE FOOD THE CARE AND THE HOUSING -- FOR THE PATIENTS -- ITEM ITEMS THAT MINIMUM WAGE IS DESIGNED TO PAY. FOR AS THE SECOND -- QUESTION WAS ASKED US TO PLEASE DO TELL THE COST RECOVERY STATUTES AND POLICIES FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE LEAVING THE STATE HOSPITAL. AND GET. MY POLITICS. BUZZ SO WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SEVENTY TO EIGHTY ONE DOES ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH -- BUT THEY CALL AT PATIENT -- A DEPOSIT FUNDS AND WE CALL THE PATIENT TRUST ACCOUNTS AND WHENEVER THE SOME DIED AND AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE DEPOSITING MONEY THAT COMES TO THE HOSPITAL FOR THE PATIENT. AND WHAT IT DOES -- STATE THAT WHENEVER THE PSALM BELONGING TO ANY ONE PATIENT -- DEPOSITED INTO THAT FUN EXCEEDS THE SUM OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE ACCESS MAY BE APPLIED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE CARE SUPPORT MAINTENANCE A MEDICAL ATTENTION OF THE PATIENT -- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE WAKE OF A SATCHEL STATUTORILY ALTHOUGH ALSO AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE AID TO PAVE INDIGNANT INDIGENT PATIENTS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING INTO THEIR ACCOUNT. AND AT THAT RATE IS TWELVE FIFTY PER MONTH. AS WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE -- SEVENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE ALSO A PROVIDES THAT THE SPOUSE PARENT CHILDREN OF A PATIENT THERE IS -- MISSTATES GUARDIANS A CONSERVATORSHIP ALSO BE LIABLE FOR THE CARE OF THE PATIENT. AND UPON DISCHARGE WHEN THE HOSTILE TRUSTS OFFICERS DO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION THAT A PATIENT IS DISH -- TO PENDING DISCHARGE OUR PRACTICES NOT TO CONTINUE WITH HOLE OF A SWITCH -- DEDUCTING THE AMOUNTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THAT THE PATIENTS DO HAVE THAT AS MUCH MONEY POSSIBLE WHEN THEY DO DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL. AND THEN THE THIRD -- QUESTION WAS TO PLEASE EXPLAIN EXPLAIN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION PROVISIONS THE LAW IS CLEAR -- THAT PATIENTS ARE ALREADY -- EMPLOYEES FOR THE PURPOSES OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. THIS REALLY JUST CLARIFY THE LADIES AND THE PATIENTS BENEFITS WITH RESPECT -- TO AS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION -- IT MIRRORS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE EXISTING WORKERS COMPENSATION LANGUAGE THAT EXIST FOR CDC OUR PRISONERS. IT CLARIFIES THAT PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS WHEN THE INJURY ARISES OUT OF WORK. THAT'S PERFORMED AS PART OF OCCASIONAL REHAB OR THE SHELTERED WORKSHOP PROGRAMS IT CLARIFIES THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYABLE WHEN THE INJURY AS A RESULT OF AN ASSAULT OR AN INTENTIONAL ACT OF SELF HARM. AND IT CLARIFIES THAT THE BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE AFTER PATIENT IT WAS RELEASED FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL NOT WHILE THEY'RE IN OUR CARE AS WE PROVIDE ALL THE MEDICAL. TREATMENT FOR THEM. DELAY -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE. SIX MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR RECOGNIZING I THINK WHAT WE SAW SOME SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THE THE DISPARATE WAGES THAT HAVE BEEN PAID IN THE PAST AND THE AMOUNTS OF THAT SO WE THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP -- IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WOULD JUST RAISE I THINK THREE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT -- THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ONE ONE IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE RACED TO THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD NOT BE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE BUT SHOULD BE TO THE STATEMENT MINIMUM WAGE RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE SERVICES. THAT -- THE PATIENTS ARE SECOND AS YOU -- AS YOU HEARD THERE IS -- FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LIMITATION NOW THAT THE WAGE ON THE THAT CAN BE KEPT IN THE ACCOUNT NOW THAT OF THE WAGES HAVE BEEN INCREASED. WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT THAT BE INCREASED TO AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THAT SERVES I THINK THE IMPORTANT PURPOSE THE DEPARTMENT WAS MENTIONING THAT -- IT EASES RE ENTRY FOR THOSE PATIENTS THAT'D BE LEAVING AND HOPEFULLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- AS WELL. AND THE FINALLY THERE THERE ARE I THINK ABOUT STE NINETY SIX WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE -- THAT WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR MINIMUM WAGE TO THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT THOSE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE -- GRANDFATHERED IN -- FOR THE TIME IT THAT THEY'RE STAYING AND THE FACILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING ITUP TO THE DíAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. SO WHAT IS THE HIM THE MOD. FOR THE FOR THE AGENCY -- WORKERS COOPERATE. FOR THE HAS THIS BEEN GOING UP FOR A LONG TIME [inaudible] THE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION. FOR THE PATIENTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE NEVER HAD A CLAIM THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THE FROM OUR PATIENTS WHILE THEY DO QUALIFY FOR WORKERS COMP WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CLAIMS WITH I'M FROM A PATIENT. TO NATURE. AND SO. COULD YOU GIVE ME. AN APPROXIMATION OR AN AVERAGE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PATIENT'S. GOING OUT WITH A REHABILITATION PROGRAM HOW MUCH THE STATE IS SPENT IN THEIR IN THEIR CARE COMPARATIVELY -- SO. AS OF THE GERMAN JUST POINTED OUT WEEK YOU KNOW WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE GETTING STATE MINIMUM WAGE BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS THE STATE PAID FOR THE REHABILITATION UP TO THAT POINT. OF FOR THE WAGES. ONE OF THEIR CARE. FOR THE CARE THE TOTAL COST OF CARE FOR A PATIENT AND WITHIN OUR STATE HOSPITALS AVERAGES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT -- THIS THE GENERAL FUND OKAY SO. THEY'VE BEEN REHABILITATED TO A WITH. TAXPAYER MONEY. AND THEN PUT WE'RE GONNA PAY THEM. MINIMUM WAGE TO CONTINUE THAT PROCESS. SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE'S A POINT IN TIME THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RETURN OUR DOLLAR. TO AS AN INVESTMENT ON THE REHABILITATION. SO HOW DO WE COULD WE I I KNOW THEY HAVE A VALUE. AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTH. IN WAYS BUT BACK SOMEDAY THE TAXPAYER. AS WE KEEP A YEAH I THINK THE GOAL OF A REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PATIENTS DO LEAVE OUR HOSPITAL THAT THEY HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO RAIMES IT IS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND BE ABLE -- TO OBTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT -- AND BE ABLE TO MANAGE OR MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY DON'T -- COME BACK TO THE STATE HOSPITAL -- AND THE STATE HOSPITAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU BYE. I MADE ONE THAT THAT -- THEY SEARCH TO FUNCTIONS -- NOT ONLY DOES IT -- IS IS A THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM BUT ALSO -- AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE PERFORMING NECESSARY FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE STATE HOSPITALS THAT STILL NEED TO BE PERFORMED SO THAT'S PART OF THE PAY BACK AS YOU WOULD SAY. I GUESS WE WOULD LOOK AT HOW MANY YEARS THEY HAD BEEN AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE -- AND ISSUE SIX IF I CAN JUST. ALMOST RHETORICALLY SAYING I'M NOT SURE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE IS A LIVING WAGE AND THE REASON WHY CALIFORNIA'S LEADING TO HAVE A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE -- I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ECHO -- CREEK TRIALS COMMENTS IF I COULD SPECIFICALLY -- WANTING TO TRY TO INCREASE TWO THOUSAND I THINK IT FOR INCREASING THE PAY WE SHOULD HAVE AN INCREASE CAP -- AND IT DOES SEEM UNFAIR THAT SOME WILL BE GETTING A PAY DECREASE DUE TO THE POLICIES THAT WERE PASSING -- AND JUST WOULD ASK THAT WE MAKE SURE WE TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT. THE WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN FOR THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTING TO CONVERT THREE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION ON GOING TO CONTINUE OUR EXPANDED HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY. ARE -- OFFICE OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES IS A FULL SERVICE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHICH PROVIDE SAFETY AND SECURITY TO OUR PATIENTS STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AND THE MEASURE DISTRIBUTED AMONG OUR FIVE HOSPITALS. WHEN AN H. PO IS HIGHER THEY ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND -- THE D. S. H. POLICE ACADEMY THIS IS A FOURTEEN WEEK ECONOMY. THAT ENSURES THAT ALL CADETS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND STATUS AT AND STANDARDS OF THE H. B. O. CLASSIFICATION. HISTORICALLY PRIOR TO THE THREE LIMITS ARE PUT AT TERM POSITIONS ACADEMY RAN TWO SESSIONS ANNUALLY ABOUT TO THIRTY TWO CADETS AND IN SEVEN AND FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO EXPAND THE COME OUT CATEGORY TWO THREE ACADEMIES. OF UP -- TO FIFTY CAN'T OKAY LOCATION AT THE S. H. ATASCADERO TO CAMP SAN LUIS OBISPO. OBISPO TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE IN THE CLASS SIZES -- THE HOSPITAL POLICE ACADEMY WHICH ALSO PROVIDES THE REQUIRED CONTINUED ADD EDUCATION TRAINING FOR OFFICERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I AM A CONSISTS OF FOUR FULL TIME STAFF A CHIEF SERGEANT INTO EACH PO'S AND THREE WITH LIMITED TERM SERGEANT POSITIONS. THE CURRENT ECONOMY STOCK PROVIDE MOST OF THE INSTRUCTION THEY PREFER CURRICULUM DESIGN AS WELL AS TEST EVALUATORS AND AND COORDINATORS FOR THE ONGOING TRAINING. AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE ECONOMY EXPANDED ACADEMY WILL ASSIST US IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF FILLING OUR VACANCIES AS WELL AS ADDRESSING IT TO PATRICIAN. AND MEETING THE INCREASE AN OFFICER NEEDS IT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED BED SECURE AS SECURE BACK TO PASS THE AT METROPOLITAN AND THE IN HIS TREATMENT PROGRAMS AT ATASCADERO AND COTTON. LA -- DEPARTMENT FUNDS. WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE IS A NEED TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THE ACADEMY AT ITS EXPANDED RATE HOWEVER EVEN IF THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE OFFICER ATTRITION RATE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE ACADEMY DO IT WOULD START PRODUCING EXCESS GRADUATES WITHIN THREE YEARS. SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO OPERATE IT AT ITS EXPANDED CAPACITY FOR THREE YEARS. AND THAT IT MONITOR THE OFFICER ATTRITION RATE IN THE MEANTIME BECAUSE IT OFFERS OR ATTRITION RATE IS LESS THAN EXPECTED OR MORE THAN EXPECTED. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IN A IN A POSITION TO ADDRESS FUNDING ACCORDINGLY SO WE'D RECOMMEND REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON OFFICER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION IN FRONT. I'M GONNA FIND IT'S A PRE SHAPE THAT ALEJO'S -- COMMENTARY ON THE PROPOSAL AND KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD AND SIMILAR TO OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BUDGET WITH STATE HOSPITALS BUDGET. AS WE'VE SEEN -- WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING AT THEM THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION AND MAKING THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS WHETHER IT UP OR DOWN. AS NEED AS WE SEE FIT AND SO SOME BE SOMETHING THAT WE EVALUATE MOVING FORWARD BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THAT STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAM THAT WILL MAKING THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TOOK. TO FOR THOSE NEEDS WHETHER THEY ARE DOWN OR UP. THANK YOU. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. SEVEN SING NONO BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS -- AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN. AND NOW WE ARE WILL. GO TO THE NON DISCUSSION ITEMS ISSUES EIGHT NINE AND TEN IF THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THOSE ISSUES NOW WOULD BE THE TIME. SEEING NONE. THAT WILL END TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING
