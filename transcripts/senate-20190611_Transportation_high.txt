AB ONE EIGHTY FIVE PROMOTE SMARTER TRANSPORTATION PLANNING BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN JOINT MEETINGS WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. AND THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD AS HOUSEHOLDS ARE DRIVEN FROM JOB IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS TOWARD MORE AFFORDABLE AREAS. THEY'RE FACED WITH LONGER COMMUTE TIMES RESULTING IN GREATER POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY INCLUDING EIGHT CD AND THE A. R. B. IN THESE MEETINGS. FUTURE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING CAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WILL LAND USE DECISIONS GROWTH PATTERNS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF JOBS AND HOUSING WHICH IS A NECESSARY STEP IN COMBATING THE ISSUE OF HOUSING SPRAWL.

AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENERAL HAVE MY WITNESS SELF INTRODUCE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DAHLE AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS -- JOE FOR BOROUGH AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- FOR TWENTY TO SAY OUR DEEPEST APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING UP THIS RECOMMENDATION BY THE COMMISSION IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT OUR INAUGURAL MEETING LAST YEAR IN JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE STATE RESOURCE -- EVERY FOR SPORT AND THE COMMISSION. IT WAS EVIDENT FROM TESTIMONIES FROM OUR COMMISSION MEMBERS BOARD MEMBER STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THAT A KEY VOICE WAS MISSING IN THE DISCUSSION AND THE GREATER -- LANDSCAPE OF LOOKING AT THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORTATION AND OUSING GOALS. THIS IS WHY THE COMMISSION -- FACILITATED THIS -- RECOMMENDATION AND GIVING DE A CONNECTION BETWEEN HOUSING AND LAND USE POLICY SUPPORT THESE GOALS WE BELIEVE THAT ATVS PARTICIPATION IN THESE JOINT MEETINGS. CRITICAL FOR POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON ISSUES SUCH AS LAND USE DECISIONS CROWD PATTERNS BUT SOLICITING AND PERMITTING.

THREE TO EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND STUFF. FOR THE WORK THAT THEY PUT INTO THIS BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STOP AND AMENDMENTS PURSUANT TO PAGE FOUR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BUT BECAUSE OF TIME AND WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING THEM IN THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE -- AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE UPDATES CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION PLANNING DOCUMENT TO INCORPORATE CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS SUCH AS SB THIRTY TWO AND THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY PLANS. AND WE ALL KNOW THE DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM HELL THE TROOPER FROM TEL PIPES FROM ALL SORTS OF VEHICLES ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO R. G. H. G. INVENTORY AND AND WHAT ONE DIRECTION IN THE STATE WE'RE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WITH THE AIR QUALITY TO MISSIONS. ARMED WITH A 2% INCREASE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND NOW. THIS UPDATE TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS LONG OVERDUE AND WOULD FOR IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS WE EXPECT OUR COMPANIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO RESPECT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND WE SHOULD EXPECT NO LESS FROM OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES THEY SHOULD BE -- IN KEEPING WITH THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORTERS WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND ROCKING COULD NOT RUSHING WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR -- JUST TO BE CLEAR AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION AND I REQUEST REQUEST FULLY REQUEST REQUEST YOUR HIGHEST CONSIDERATION THANK YOU I'M ABOUT ALL GO TO MY WITNESS AGO SEVEN WOMAN -- WILL TAKE US TWENTY PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL BEAR AND WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WE THINK IT'S A COMMON SENSE -- MEASURE TO UPDATE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE TRANSPORTATION PLANS -- THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATIONS TWENTY NINETEEN STATE OF THE ERROR REPORT FOUND CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO SEVEN OF THE TEN MOST -- SMOG POLLUTED CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND ALSO WE SAW THAT -- THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OR MAKING OUR JOB OF CLEANING UP THERE THAT MUCH HARDER. TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ESPECIALLY PASSENGER VEHICLES IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF POLLUTION BOTH ON THE A CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE FRONT. THIS BILL INSURANCE OF THE STATE TRANSPORTATION PLANS ACCOUNT FOR TREATMENT OF OUR CLEAN AIR ACT AND STATE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES WILL ALSO IDENTIFYING. OPPORTUNITIES TO ALIGN TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAMS TO BETTER SUPPORT THE POLLUTION BENEFIT PRODUCTION BENEFITS WE NEED. AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT OF REGIONAL SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES TO EVALUATE. HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PLANS WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE OVERALL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIANS DESERVE? THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF MOVING CALIFORNIA FORD IN ENSURING THAT ALL SECTORS ARE REDUCING HARMFUL POLLUTION WELL BUILDING HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IMPORTANTLY AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE CREATE SPACE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS WITHIN THE PLAN'S GOING FORWARD IN RECOGNITION THAT MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION -- GIVEN THE URGENCY OF ACHIEVING OUR HEALTH PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY CLIMATE STANDARDS WE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IS A AGAIN A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. TO UPDATING THE PLANTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT NEW MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN I'M WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND A WE SUPPORT A. B. TWO EIGHTY FIVE THE HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS OF TAILPIPE EMISSIONS ARE IRREFUTABLE. WHETHER IT'S MOM OR MOM OR DAD SOCCER VANDALS A DELIVERY DROPPING OUT PACKAGES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER ROLLING DOWN THE FREEWAY. WE ARE POPPING TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR AIR THAT ARE HEATING UP OUR CLIMATE MAKING PEOPLE SICK. TRANSPORTATION SOURCES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80% SMOG FORMING KNOCKS EMISSIONS 90% OF DIESEL PM. AND APPROXIMATELY HOW FAR GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA THESE POLLUTANTS IMPACT AIR QUALITY IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTING TO A WIDE RANGE OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING AS MY TAX E. R. VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. HEART ATTACKS STROKES AND PREMATURE DEATHS. CARBON POLLUTION FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM DRIVES CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED CONDITIONS FOR EXTREME HEAT. DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES. YET THERE IS A SERIOUS DISCONNECT WITH OUR AIR QUALITY CLIMATE GOALS IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. WE ON THE PATH TO FAILURE IN MEETING OUR GHG REDUCTION TARGET FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. UNLESS WE SOLVE THE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING PLANNING CONUNDRUM. COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORTS AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T SURE THAT CURRENT. CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE STANDARDS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN. AB TWENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE CALTRANS TO ADDRESS HOW WE WILL REACH THE NECESSARY EMISSION REDUCTIONS NECESSARY TO ME CLEAN AIR REQUIREMENTS. IN CALIFORNIA IS TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE STANDARDS IN FUTURE TRANSPORTATION PLANS FUTURE PLANS WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDERATIONS AS MY COLLEAGUE WILL POINT IT OUT. THERE'S CRITICAL NEED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND INVESTMENT SUPPORT REDUCTIONS IN THE POLLUTANTS THAT THREATEN THE HEALTH OF TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE WOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEETING THIS NEED THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MARSHALL HERE SPEAKERS IN FAVOR.

THANK YOU -- TO HAVE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL COME FOR PLEASE ANYBODY OPPOSED [inaudible] SEE NONE. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE A QUESTIONS. OF ALL THROUGH MY CLOTHES. JUST A AGAIN THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM IT FROM OUR DIFFERENT PLANNING AGENCIES AND OUR LOCALITIES AND SUPPORT TO GET CITY AGENCIES ON THE SAME PAGE I WOULD REQUEST FULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. WHEN A TOTAL -- TAKE A BILL UP SHORTLY WHEN OF COURSE. IT WILL GO ON YOUR NEXT BILL WHICH IS ITEM. TEN ELEVEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR NOW ACCOUNTS 440% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL EMISSIONS. AND WE'RE JUST NOT ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY. CARBS SB ONE FIFTY REPORT IDENTIFIED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO PREVENTING THE STATE FROM MEETING ITS TRANSPORTATION GOALS ONE WAS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE DATA THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ACCURATE -- PLANS FOR TEA AND SEES AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO REQUIRES CALIFORNIA'S NPOS TO INCLUDE METRICS ABOUT TNC IS AS PART OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE TRANSPORTATION PLANS TO INCLUDE MEASURES REGARDING BARRIERS TO THE UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT INCLUDING TRANSFERRED FREQUENTLY. SURE OF FREQUENCY PARKING OF SAUDIS FOR BICYCLES. IN ADDITION AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO DIRECTS THE CPUC TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF NPOS AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN PLANNING AND MEETING THEIR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY GOALS. WHEN DECIDING ON TNC DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS? M. P. O.'S ANOTHER TRANSIT INTO ENTITIES NEED APPROPRIATE DATA IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE USE OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES. INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSIT UTILIZATION AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS UPDATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS AND ADDING DIRECTION TO THE C. P. UC'S REGARDING TNC DATA REPORTING WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AND PLANS. I WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MINUTES% LONG TERM TRUCK CLIMATE IN ITS TRANSPORTATION GOALS. WITHOUT JUST TODAY WE RECEIVED A LETTER OF OPPOSITION FROM T. AND SEES AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM GOING FORWARD. IN THE SENATE YOU AND SEE COMMITTEE TO FINE TUNE THE CPUC PART OF THE BILL IN OUR INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS DOABLE AND WE WOULD ASK FOR THE RESPECT TO ALLOW THIS TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. SO WE CAN WORK WITH THEM I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE IMPORTANT ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SP ONE FIFTY REPORT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROTECTING USER PRIVACY. AND NOT IMPOSING OVERLY OWNERS REQUIREMENTS ON THE TNC IS WE'RE REALLY OUT TO HELP THEM HELP EVERYBODY GETTHE LOCALITIES GET CITIES THE DATA THAT THEY NEED SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN EFFECTIVELY.

AND WHY YOU WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING IS THAT -- TNC IS DECREASED TRANSIT RIDERSHIP INCREASED VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED INCREASED CONGESTION AND POTENTIALLY HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON SAFETY -- AS WE DESIGN OUR STREETS AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SERVICES WE DELIVER THIS DATA BECOMES REALLY ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE GOOD CHOICES AND THAT WE HAVE GOOD OUTCOMES. THANK YOU WILL PAUSE AND TAKE ROLE WE HAVE A QUORUM. SENATOR ABOUT YOUR BELL PRESENT BATES. IT'S PRESENT DOT. DODD PRESENT GALGIANI. JOHNNY PRESENT MCGUIRE MORALE. MORRELL PRESENT ROTH.

OF OKAY ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL -- KIND OF SPEAKERS OPPOSING PLEASE COME FOR PLEASE [inaudible] WELCOME. THEY COME RIGHT UP HERE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS COURTNEY JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF TECHNET -- UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO AFTER THE JUNE THIRD AMENDMENTS -- WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THESE AMENDMENTS BEFORE THEY WENT INTO PLANTS WHICH IS WHY ARE OPPOSITION IS NOT REFLECTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS -- AND WE WERE DETERMINING THE BROAD RANGE OF THE HEAD THERE THE BRIDE -- LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN THE BILL AFTER IT WENT INTO PRINT ON JUNE THIRD AND DID GET OUR LETTER IN TODAY SO WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATENESS ON THAT BUT WE WERE. LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE THAT WENT INTO PRINT ON JUNE THIRD TO TRY TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THAT LANGUAGE -- THE RANGER INDUSTRY ENABLES MOBILITY FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITHIN THESE PLATFORMS IS DATA THAT WE UNDERSTAND CAN BE USEFUL FOR PLANNING PURPOSES -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER THESE USES MUST BE BALANCED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RISK CREATED Y THE SHARING OF GEO LOCATION AND MOVEMENT DATA OF WRITERS WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE RISKS GIVEN THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE DATA. THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE SHARED WITHOUT ANY PRE ESTABLISHED PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS. WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO AS THE WITNESSES -- TALKED ABOUT AS AN AGGREGATED DE IDENTIFIED DATA WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IN THIS BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PRINT IS A DETAILED -- TRIP DATA AND DETAILED TRIP DATA -- CAN CONTAIN SUCH THINGS AS DETAILED ORIGIN AND DESTINATION INFORMATION TIME STAMPS AND MILES TRAVELED. IT CAN BASICALLY BE USED TO ESTABLISH AN INDIVIDUAL'S TRAVEL PATTERNS AND POTENTIALLY REVEAL SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EIGHTY WRITER -- FURTHER THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CPUC TO UNDERCUT AN EXISTING PROPOSED RULING RELATED TO TNC DATA SHARING BY REQUIRING TNC IS TO SHARED AS I AS SAID DETAILED TRIP DATA WITH VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIESAND AN UNDEFINED OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES -- FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS ALSO NOT CLEARLY DEFINED. IT DOES NOT SPECIFY WHO THE RECIPIENT RECIPIENTS THE DATA ARE POTENTIALLY ALLOWING ANYONE TO CLAIM ACCESS TO THIS HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION -- WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT AS THIS LANGUAGE DID GOING TO PLAN ON JUNE THIRD WE DO THINK THAT IT WOULD TAKE IT TAKES MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS. I ALSO DO HAVE TO SAY THERE'S A BILL THAT WAS AT SLATED BE HEARD TODAY AB ELEVEN TWELVE WHICH WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MUCH MORE NARROWLY TAILORED WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA SHARING. I'M REQUIREMENTS IT IS ALSO AUTHORED BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL -- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT OUR HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL ESPECIALLY THE DETAILED TRIP INFORMATION -- WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE SPEAKING ON KNOWLEDGE AND HIS BILL. GO AHEAD PLEASE. YES -- WITH -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT TECHNO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS -- OTHERS SPEAKERS PLEASE ANYBODY ELSE -- OKAY -- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE PROPS YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERN I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE'S CLEARLY -- A VERY STRONG RATIONALE FOR HAVING THE STATE TO BE SHARED WITH PLANNING AGENCIES IN WITH COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING UP WE'RE GOING TO ADD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IF WE WERE TO FILL ANY GAPS -- AND I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AT THIS POINT WOULD STOP OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE TECH COMMUNITY WITH ALL OF THE TNC IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BREAK ANY CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMITTEE WHOSE JURISDICTION THIS IS UNDER. TO MAKE URE THAT WHAT'S COLLECTED IS NOT IDENTIFYING OF ANY INDIVIDUALS THAT ANY PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED -- WE ARE -- PRO TECHNOLOGY PRO FILLING IN THOSE GAPS SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY'S BUSINESS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS. TO SOME DATA ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING TRIPS SO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND WITH THAT I WOULD REQUIRE REQUEST BELIEVE REQUEST ALL OF YOU ALLOWING ME TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH THEM BY PUTTING FOR THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU -- OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MY RECOMMENDATIONS -- MOTION FAVOR THIS WILL GO TO RULES. IF IT'S APPROVED [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY -- THE OTHER QUESTIONS WILL CALL THE ROLL PLEASE THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO THE RULES COMMITTEE CENTER ABOUT. A BELL AYE BATES -- IT'S DOT. DODD AYE GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE MCGUIRE MORALE. BROWN NO ROTH ROTH AYE RUBIO SKINNER STONE. STONE NO AMBER WHAT CASSIE. YOUR FOR ROLES IN FAVOR WILL LEAVE THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. YOU HAVE ONE MORE BILL THANK YOU MY LAST BILL IS AB FORTINO SEVEN ARE RECKLESS DRIVING AND STREET RACING IS AN EPIDEMIC ACROSS OUR STREETS IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE SEEN. MULTIPLE DEATHS FROM BYSTANDERS BECAUSE OF STREET RACING WHICH SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASING PROBLEM AND RECKLESS DRIVING IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS LOS ANGELES. THIS BILL WE BELIEVE IS A REASONABLE WAY OF STARTING TO ADDRESS THOSE MORE CRIMES MORE SERIOUSLY AND THESE ARE CRIMES BY THE WAY THAT NOT JUST KILL PEOPLE BUT THAT KEEP PARENTS FROM. ALLOWING THEIR CHILDREN JUST TO NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM WHAT THIS BILL SAYS THAT ON THE SECOND CONVICTION NOW THIS IS ON THE SECOND CONVICTION. OF EITHER MISDEMEANOR LEVEL RECKLESS DRIVING WHICH MEANS NOT JUST ROLLING A STOP SIGN OR MAKING A RIGHT WITHOUT LOOKING THIS IS PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING WITHOUT SUCH A WANTON DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE THAT IT BECOMES A CRIME. OR THE SECOND CONVICTION FOR STREET RACING BUT YOUR CAR WILL BE IMPOUNDED FOR THIRTY DAYS AND YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE ANY MODIFICATIONS FROM YOUR VEHICLE THAT MAKE IT A RACING VEHICLE AND NOT STREET LEGAL AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT WOULD BE IN LAW. THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR VEHICLE BACK UNLESS AS MODIFICATIONS ARE REMOVED. THERE'S A LOT OF OUTSOURCING PEOPLE WHO NEED THE CAR TO GET TO WORK OR FOR THE CAR OF A YOU KNOW OF A TEENAGER BUT YOU KNOW. THE PARENTS CAR THERE'S A LOT OF SAFEGUARDS IN HERE TO PREVENT HARDSHIP SOME PEOPLE BUT WHEN I SPEAK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT MY COMMUNITY WHAT THEY SAY IS THEY ARE BUSTING THE SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THEY'RE PAYING THE FINES BECAUSE THEIR NOMINAL WITH THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT IS THAT TRICKED OUT VEHICLE AND THEY HAVE SUGGESTED THIS IS A REMEDY TAKE THE CAR AWAY FROM THIRTY DAYS DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE IT'S NOT A RIGHT. AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BEING BAD BAD ENOUGH DRIVER THAT YOU HAVE TWO CONVICTIONS FOR THIS WE THINK THAT IMPOUNDING THE CARPET THIRTIES MAYBE IS THE WAITED TO TEACH A LESSON. WITHOUT I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THE SPEAKERS ARE FAVOR PLEASE. A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TIM CHIANG WITH THE AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE AUTHOR -- WHEN REGULAR FINDS DON'T DO THE TRICK THEN WE BELIEVE THAT IMPOUNDMENT IS A PROPER REMEDY IN THE SITUATION EMPOWERMENT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO WORK IN THE PAST AND WE SUPPORT THIS PRESSURE OKAY. OTHER SPEAKERS. SPEAKERS OPPOSE PLEASE SPEAKERS OPPOSE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- WITH REGARD TO IMPOUNDMENT THIS BILL DOES ONE THING IT DENIES JUDGES THE THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF TIME IN OF EMPOWERMENT. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS IMPOUNDMENT OF THE VEHICLE USED IN RECKLESS DRIVING OR IN A SPEED CONTEST FOR PERIOD OF UP TO THIRTY DAYS -- INCLUDING THE THIRTY DAYS THAT WOULD BE NOW MANDATED UNDER THIS BILL. AB FORTINO SEVEN REMOVES THE COURT'S DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF IN TOWN AND AND INSTEAD REQUIRES THE EMPOWERMENT FOR THE FULL THIRTY DAYS FOR ANY SECOND OFFENSE OF RECKLESS DRIVING OR STREET RACING. EMPOWERMENT OF A VEHICLE AND PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS FOR A PERIOD AS LONG AS THIRTY DAYS ALL TOO OFTEN BECOMES A DE FACTO FORFEITURE. AS MANY DEFENDANTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE LARGE STORAGE FEES CHARGED WHEN A VEHICLE IS HELD FOR THAT LONG. HERE THIS YEAR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PUBLISHED A REPORT ENTITED TOWED INTO DEBT -- THAT -- WENT OVER THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS THAT VEHICLE TOES AND IMPOUNDS CAN HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS. THAT REPORT FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE STORAGE FEE IS FIFTY THREE DOLLARS PER DAY -- EIGHT WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND TOWING FEES THAT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO THESE IMPOUNDMENTS THE TOTAL COST OF A THIRTY DAY ON INCOME AND WILL BE ON AVERAGE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DOLLARS. AN AMOUNT MANY DEFENDANTS SIMPLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY -- FOR MANY OR MOST OF THOSE SUBJECT TO THESE MANDATORY THIRTY DAYS IN TOWN THAT THE RESULT WILL BE THE LOSS OF THEIR CAR. LOTS OF THE VEHICLE CAN THEN RESULT IN A DEFENDANT LOSING A JOB OR BEING UNABLE TO FULFIL FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES WELL THE BILL DOES ALLOW THE JUDGE SOME DISCRETION WHEN EMPOWERMENT WILL RESULT IN HARDSHIP TO THE FAMILY. IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER HARDSHIP TO THE DEFENDANT OR WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO GET THE CAR BACK AFTER THIRTY DAY IMPOUNDMENT. JUDGES SHOULD RETAIN DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY IN EACH CASE WHICH AS I STATED BEFORE WOULD INCLUDE AND AND AN EMPOWERMENT OF THIRTY DAYS WHERE THE OFFENSES AGREED YES ODD DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION OF THE DEFENDANT -- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THE BILL THERE'S A MOTION AND YOU HAVE A CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE IS HE HE'S HE'LL USE OUR COMMENTS I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO'S HAD THEIR CAR TOWED BECAUSE IT WAS PARTING CORRECTLY OR THEY HAVE UNPAID FINES. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTING WITH THEIR CAR IN A CRIMINAL WAY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IT'S ONE THING TO MAKE A MISTAKE ONCE AND HAVE A CONVICTION. THIS BILL IT WAS ALL ONLY TAKES EFFECT ON THE SECOND CONVICTION AND AT THAT POINT SOMEONE CLEARLY HASN'T GOTTEN THE MESSAGE WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET. WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW THAT IF THEY STOP AT A STOP SIGN AND PROCEED FOR THE NOT GOING TO GET HIT BY SOMEONE IS DRIVING A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR? IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT PEOPLE GET RECKLESS DRIVING -- OF TICKETS FOR AND THESE VEHICLES THAT ARE USED IN STREET RACING ARE. SIX BIGGER CARS THAT HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY WORKED ON THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING THEIR CAR TO WORK THEY'RE ENGAGING IN WHAT SOMETIMES A PROFIT MAKING ENTERPRISES BY TURNING OUR STREETS INTO THE FACTORY SINGS ON SO THAT THEY CAN CHARGE MONEY FOR PEOPLE TOOK TO WATCH. SO I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS AND I DO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE BUT I ALSO WANT TO PROTECT -- INNOCENT BYSTANDERS WITHOUT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THERE GALGIANI. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I TRIED WITH THIS LAST YEAR AND DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT SINCE THAT TIME THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE AND WE'VE SEEN AN EXCLAMATION. IN THE PROBLEM AND WE'VE SEEN AN ESCALATION THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH TONIGHT HOPEFULLY THIS TIME -- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE BILL ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET IT SIGNED. SO MUCH SENATOR. I WOULD RECOMMEND IN FAVOR OF IT -- I RECALL A TIRED SENATOR DRIVING THROUGH. CENTER WHAT CAO SKIS DISTRICT. IN FREMONT MILPITAS WHICH IS NORTH KOREA'S. FOR THIS RIGHT.

B. -- TWELVE SIXTY SIX YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON I APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT -- TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SIXTY SIX AND SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK OF PREPARING THE ANALYSIS AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT FULL EXPLANATION OF WHAT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO -- AND SO CERTAINLY AS WAS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS -- MISTER CHAIR I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- SO STAFF I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU -- AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MORE VEHICLES MORE MOTORISTS ON THE ROAD THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT -- SOME DATA. OUR STATE HAS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF BICYCLE -- THE COMMUTERS IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF IS A STATE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. OUT OF THIS POLICY MAKERS. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR FIRST EVER STATEWIDE PLAN. FOR ACTIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION A STATEWIDE PLANET WITH A GOAL OF THEM OF OF OF PROVIDING ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH ROBUST MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS -- AND WELL EXPAND IT SAYS IS SUCH OPTIONS IT IS CERTAINLY A GOOD THING -- IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. TO IMPROVING CREATE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS ENVIRONMENTS -- THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE BOTH MOTORIZED TRAFFIC AND CYCLISTS. AND SO OVER TEN YEARS AGO I WAS -- A PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER INSIDE OUT TO PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS OF MY LIFE. IN THOSE TIMES I WAS ON DUTY AND HOW TO RESPOND TO A VEHICLE VERSE -- A PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT. ALMOST EVERY SITUATION EVERY ACCIDENT I RESPONDED. TO HAD OCCURRED AT A TRAFFIC INTERSECTION. AND SO THIS EXPERIENCE MY TIME AS A PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER -- MOTIVATED ME TO INTRODUCE HIS BILL. I IN A MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY BILL TOSS IT IS TWELVE SIXTY SIX WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO IMPROVE SAFETY. AND REDUCE CONFUSION FOR BOTH DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS WHEN APPROACHING TRAFFIC INTERSECTIONS. AND SO FOR MOST INTERSECTIONS IN OUR STATE BIKE LANES AND ABRUPTLY. THE END OF BROCCOLI UPON MERGING INTO THE ITH A RIGHT TURN LANE OR IN SOME CASES IF IT'S A ONE WAY STREET A LEFT TURN LANE. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO AND THE ANALYSIS STAFF TO FANTASTIC JOB AND TRY TO EXPLAIN IT SO BEAR WITH ME AS I TRY TO PAINT YOU A PICTURE. SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH A TOOL WITH THIS NEW OPTION. A SAFER OPTION THAT WOULD ALLOW A SHARED AT LANE CONCEPT. AND THAT IS A RIGHT TURN LANE OR IN THE CASE OF A ONE WAY STREET A LEFT TURN LANE. THESE TURN LANES WOULD ALSO CONSIST OF A BY CALLING A BIKE LANE THAT WOULD BE LOCATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD BE MAKING THEIR INTENDED TURN SO ON THE OUTSIDE. OF THE THE OUTSIDE PORTION OF THE LINE AND SO THIS THIS TYPE OF A DESIGN WOULD DIRECT DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS ON SAFE PASSED THROUGH INTERSECTIONS. SO CYCLIST TRAVELING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WOULD BE GUIDED TO TRAVEL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD BE MAKING THEIR INTENDED TURN -- AND SO THIS BILL -- WOULD FURTHER REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION TO DEVELOP THE STANDARDS I BELIEVE -- THE STANDARD WOULD BE OR THE PROPOSED ENERGY IS TO HAVE THE PAVEMENT MARKINGS.
