HIGHER EDUCATION TO ORDER. I AM CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOSE MEDINA. THIS HEARING IS TIMELY. IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT I LEARNED OF CS USE QUANTITATIVE REASONING ADMISSION PROPOSAL. WHEN. I FIRST LEARNED OF THE PROPOSAL I WAS VERY SURPRISED. WHY AND I AS CHAIR OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE PROPOSAL BY CSU. THEN I FOUND OUT. OF FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT MOST OF THEM WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL EITHER. WELL THERE BEEN A FEW OTHER IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT I HAD PLANNED TO HEAR HAVE HEARINGS ON I MEAN LEAD CHANGE MY PLANS SO THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD CONVENE A HEARING. ON CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL. I THINK THAT IT'S SIMPLY THAT IMPORTANT. THE GOAL OF THIS HEARING IS TO LEARN DIRECTLY FROM THE CSU THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PROPOSAL. LEARN WHAT. IF ANY UNINTENDED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COME WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND TO HEAR FROM THE STAKE HOLDER GROUPS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS NOT NECESSARILY BEEN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. BETWEEN THE CSU AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. I WILL BE LISTENING TO HIM TO LEARN WHY. I TRUST THAT AT THE END OF THIS HEARING WE WILL BE ABLE TO WALK AWAY HAVING HAD A COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION AND MOVING FORWARD WE'LL KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN. WITH ALL INVOLVED. AND LET ME JUST TO REITERATE A LITTLE BIT. ON THAT AS AS I SPEAK. WITH MY OWN COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. I FIND OF. THEIR OWN SURPRISE. OF THE CSU PROPOSAL. AS I SPOKE WITH MY OWN A SUPERINTENDENT A RIVERSIDE UNIFIED. ALSO NOT NOT AWARE AND SO I A I DO VERY STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS HEARING IS IMPORTANT. WITH THAT LET ME INVITE UP TO THE TABLE.

AND BEFORE YOU BEGIN. ANNOUNCER ALREADY. OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE BACK AT THE AT THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO CLARIFY ALSO THAT I'M I'M HERE NOT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF BEEN A FACULTY MEMBER THERE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND HAVE PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSAL BUT I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M VERY UP A PLEASE BE BACK WHERE WE ARE ABOUT TO CELEBRATE THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ELIGIBILITY POLLS FOR CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF THE NATIONAL PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS WAS A WAS FINALIZED IN NINETEEN SIXTY BUT IT WAS IN THE FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER NINETEEN FIFTY NINE. THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED ON THE ELIGIBILITY RULES PROPOSED BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT THE TIME WE ARE ARMS ARE THAT THAT THAT THE PRESIDENT DISCUSS STATE AT THE TIME AS A WAY TO MANAGE DOWN AND ROLL MINTS AT BOTH UC AND CSU AND TO DIVERGE AT THE TIME FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES SYSTEM AND THE RESERVE IT BACKWARDS OF THE PERIOD OF IMMENSE GROWTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE MASTER PLAN STUDY COMMITTEE WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT THE LEGISLATURE'S WATCHING CAREFULLY. OUTSIDE ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL TASKS THAT DEALING WITH ENROLLMENT SEARCH THAT THE FIRST OF THE TIDAL WAVES AND ELIGIBILITY POOLS WERE CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY THAT WOULD REDUCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT AT YOU SEE AND THIS YEAR THAT WAS REALLY BILLS WERE NEW IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE BUT THE ROLE OF THE OF THE SYSTEMS IN IT IN AFFECTING TWELVE EDUCATION WAS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE ACTUALLY PROVISION THAT PROHIBITED IT WOULD HAVE A PROHIBITED SUB TO IT DID NOT ALLOW FOR OF THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE ANY MONEY FOR A. PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE CONSTANTLY. LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. DURING THAT PERIOD HIGH SCHOOLS EMERGED NONETHELESS A FULLY FUNDED BY LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES. AND FROM THE BEGINNING IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION. IN IN IN IN IN THEIR SERVICES. AT BEGINNING IN THAT JUST BEFORE THE TURN OF THAT CENTURY. UC FACULTY BEGAN TO A CREDIT. HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THIS BEFORE WASCO ACCREDITATION OR ANYTHING ELSE SO WAS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT SET THE STANDARDS FOR. ALL THE ALL THE COURSES FOR GRADUATION AND ULTIMATELY FOR PREPARATION. AND THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WE THINK OF TODAY'S ATG. WAS IN SOME SENSE EVEN MORE SPECIFIC BACK THAT THE IN ITS FIRST THEN THE FIRST VERY ITERATIONS. SO RATHER THAN THE GENERAL THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT TODAY THE UNIVERSITY SAID YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETED LADY OF THE LAKE. MERCHANT OF VENICE PLUTARCH'S LIVES. ARITHMETIC INCLUDING THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT NOT NECESSARILY PROFIT LOSS IN TAXES. QUADRATIC EQUATIONS BUT NOT THE MEASUREMENT OF A CIRCLE. GEOGRAPHY AT LEAST AS IT'S USED IN THE FIRST GRADE. LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT LOTS AND LOTS OF LATIN. PHYSICS BUT ONLY TALKS VERY MENTALLY L. ALONG WITH CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY TRIGONOMETRY PHYSIOLOGY OR IF NONE OF THOSE FREE DRAWING. SO THE LEGISLATURE AT THE UNIVERSITY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING. THE CURRICULUM A NOT JUST OF THE SCHOOLS BUT OF THE CLASSES THEMSELVES OF DATING BACK TO THE TURN OF THE- TWENTIETH CENTURY. BUT I'M AND CONTINUED FOR QUITE A LONG TIME IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BEGAN WHAT WHAT WAS THE EIGHT AFTER CORMAN'S AND STATE AS A TO F. FOR DECADES AND DECADES AND DECADES UNTIL BECOMING A TO G. AT THE LATTER PART OF THE LAST CENTURY. AND THOSE EIGHT EVER COURTS HAVE LARGELY STAYED THE SAME FROM THAT FROM THAT PERIOD. AND ALTHOUGH. WE MAY NOT THINK ABOUT THE OF THE LEVEL OF RIGOR OF SCIENCE IN EVANS BACK THAT THERE WERE QUITE A FEW DISSERTATIONS AND STUDIES DONE BY THE- PRESIDENT'S OFFICE BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND- KILLER AT THE TIME. OF THE RELATIVE. VALUE OF SUCH COURSES FIRST. AID VERSUS OTHER WAYS OF. ADMISSION OTHER WERE NO TESTS. STANDARDIZED TESTS AT THAT POINT THOSE WERE TO COME RELATIVELY SOON. BUT THE SUBJECT MATTER COURSES CAME ABOUT SHORTLY AFTER THE ACADEMIC SENATE BECAME RECOGNIZED AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF GOVERNANCE AROUND ADMISSIONS. NOW TODAY WE TAKE THAT LARGELY FOR GRANTED BUT IN IT WAS A NIGHT IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES BUT SPECIFICALLY IN ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY. THAT THE BERKELEY REVOLUTION CREATED WHAT TODAY IS OUR MODEL OF ECONOMIC SHARED GOVERNANCE IN CALIFORNIA. IN EDUCATION POLICY IN ADMISSIONS WERE SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE UNIVERSITY TO THE YOUR ACCOUNT FOR HIS ACADEMIC SENATE AT THAT PERIOD. ABOUT THAT TIME IS WHEN THE CSU STARTED TO CONGEAL AS A STATE COLLEGES UNDER THE STATE BOARD. AS WELL BUT DID NOT HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE BACK IN OF ACADEMIC OF SHARED GOVERNANCE AT THAT AT THAT POINT. AND THROUGH THAT PERIOD. BOTH THE CONSTITUTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND ALL OF THE STATUTES THAT SET UP SEE IT'S OF THE STATE COLLEGES ALL WERE INSISTENT THAT THERE SHALL BE NO POLITICAL OR SECTARIAN INFLUENCE. ON THE TO CALIFORNIA OR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THE LANGUAGE IS MOSTLY THE SAME IT'S JUST UC'S LANGUAGES IN THE CONSTITUTION. BUT THE NOTION AROUND AUTONOMY OF THE SYSTEMS AND THE THEY'RE SETTING OF ACADEMIC MATTERS IN ADMISSIONS WAS LARGELY DELEGATED EVEN AT THAT STAGE TO THE TO THE INSTITUTIONS. I'M THEMSELVES AND THEN BEGINNING IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE. BY THE TIME THAT THE MASTER PLAN CAME AROUND. THAT SYSTEM WAS STARTING TO BURST SCHOOLS WERE SAYING IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO BE ACCREDITING US WE DO OTHER THINGS AND JUST SENSE OF FOLKS UP TO COLLEGE. WATCH ACCREDITATION WAS CREATED ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF I'M IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS THEMSELVES WITH A CREDIT EACH OTHER. AS OPPOSED TO THE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND OTHERS ARE SAYING IF YOU FINISH A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO GOON TO THE UNIVERSITY. AS A PET JUST AS A MATTER OF POLICY. SO THE MASTER PLAN CAME ABOUT IN THE QUIRK OF HISTORY AS IT HAD CAME ABOUT RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE TIDAL WAVE. AND SO OF THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS ESSENTIALLY OF THE KEEP POLICIES IT'LL DRIVE ADMISSIONS TODAY WERE SET UP IN A PERIOD OF IMMENSE. GROWTH AND A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT. SCARCITY RIGHT SO IT'S IMPORTANT JUST REMEMBER THAT THOSE CONDITIONS ARE WHAT WHAT FRAME EVERYTHING. THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT TIME. SO THE MASTER PLAN. SET THE ELIGIBILITY POOLS OF ONE THIRD FOR CSU AND TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT OR ONE EIGHT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE WERE REDUCTIONS FROM THE FROM THE POOLS FROM WHICH THE IN THE TWO UNIVERSITIES WERE ADMITTING STUDENTS PRIOR TO THE MASTER PLAN. SO THE MASTER PLAN THAT TODAY WE LARGELY CELEBRATE AS A- THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS GRAND GLOBAL A STEP FORWARD FOR ACCESS AND EXCELLENCE. ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURE WAS TO REDUCE ACCESS TO THE TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN IN THE CREATION OF THE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEM SO. CSU ELIGIBILITY WAS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. AT THAT 45% AT THAT TIME AND YOU SEE ELIGIBILITY WAS A FIFTEEN IN THE MASTER PLAN TURN THOSE NUMBERS DOWN AND SAID. BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE AND BECAUSE WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY OR THE ELITE NATURE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS DEPENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW. WE'RE GOING TO RE DIRECT STUDENTS TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES WITH THE IRON CLAD PROMISE IN THE MASTER PLAN THAT THERE WILL BE. SEAMLESS EASY SIMPLE TRANSFER SYSTEM. THAT WILL MAKE IT AS THOUGH NOBODY IS A AS A WE CHANGE NOTHING IT'S SIMPLY THAT WILL BE A- MORE COST EFFECTIVE INSTITUTION. SO THAT WAS THE PROMISE. OF THE MASTER PLAN AND THESE ELIGIBILITY INDEXES. TO KEEP THINGS TO REMEMBER FROM THE MASTER PLAN THAT ONE IT NONE OF THIS WAS WRITTEN IN THE STATUTE. EVERYTHING OF MOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE IN THE MASTER PLAN IS IN THE STATE LAW IT WAS CONTAINED IN THE DOT AND DOT AND THE DON HOW ACT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GREAT ACCLAIM. BUT REALLY SOME WAYS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF MASTER PLAN WAS NEVER CAUGHT UP. NOT ACCIDENT THE LEGISLATORS HAD MANY MANY DANCERS AND- SEVERAL REVIEWS OF THEM. TO PLAN AND- IT EVER. PARTICULARLY IN CANADA I'M PLANNING CHECK I'M AS- A MEMBER PRESS AND SALAS IN. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO PLAN BY STE. FROM THAT POOL. IT'S ONLY BEEN A CULTURAL CHANGE SINCE THAT TIME THAT WEEK WE INTERPRET NOW IT'LL ELIGIBILITY MEAN YOU'RE GUARANTEED. NOT LEGALLY BUT YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THESE INSTITUTIONS IF YOU ARE IN THE TOP ONE THIRD IN THE TOP ONE EIGHT THAT WASN'T A FEATURE OF THE ORIGINAL MASTER PLAN. A MATCH BUT WAS ALSO BEING CONSTRUCTED AT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE STANDARDIZED TEST MOVEMENT WAS HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH THE YOU SEE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGES WERE LARGELY REJECTING THE TEST APPROACH THEY BOTH BELIEVED THAT THEIR COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR YOU SEE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY THIS EIGHT F. EIGHT A. G. COURSE SEQUENCE THAT YOU'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT TODAY. FOR CSU WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT CLOSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE THAT THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND GRADES FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHERE A NOT FOR AND THAT THEY WERE CORRELATED. A WHAT THEY CORRELATED WELL WITH STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN THE FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARS. BUT THE TENSION AND BECAME HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE THESE REDUCED ELIGIBILITY POOLS AND THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS TO THAT A ONE OF WHICH SHE IS YOU. KNOW MORE OF ONE COMBINATION OF WHICH CSU INVENTED SO THE FIRST IS THE IS THE TEST SCORE AND THE GPA REQUIREMENT WHICH- WE NOW WE NOW IT'S TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THAT'S AND IT'S AN INDEX. TO FEED IN IN A GRADE AND YOU'VE DONE YOUR GPA AND YOUR FEET IN YOUR TEST SCORE AND THE INDEX OF THAT DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. THAT'S NOT FROM THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF THE MATCH POINT IT SPECIFY HOW ELIGIBILITY WAS TO BE. CALCULATED BUT THAT CA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CREATED THAT INDEX ITSELF AND YOU SEE FOLLOWED SHORTLY. SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS SEPARATE FROM THE INDEX IS THE COURSE PAT REQUIRE THAT YOU MUST COMPLETED THE WORD THAT THE COURT SCHOOLS COURSE. AND THEN WERE EIGHT EVAN TODAY. EIGHT A G. AND THEY ARE INDEED. DETERMINANTS OF ELIGIBLE SHE BOTH OF THAT IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE. THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. DO YOU THINK WHEN I GET TO THE WRAP UP IS THAT. INCREASING THE TEST SCORE VERSES INCREASINGTHE GPA REQUIREMENT SO IF YOU HAVE A- JUST A NOTE SUPPORT BUT WE'LL GET PRACTICE QUANTITATIVE REASONING HERE. IF YOU HAVE TO MEET IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO A 33% TARGET. AND YOU'RE CURRENTLY AT THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE OR THIRTY EIGHT OR 40% IN ORDER TO. REDUCE THAT THE THREE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COURSES. INCREASE THE GPA REQUIRED OR INCREASE THE TEST SCORE REQUIRED. AND SO AT A IF THAT EQUATION IS GOING TO STAY THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T HAVE FOUR DEGREES OF FREEDOM. YOU CANNOT PICK AN ELIGIBILITY TARGET PLUS A TEST SCORE TARGET PLAZA. GPA TARGET PLUS OF COURSE START EVEN SOMETHING HAS TO VERY BE VARIABLE. AND SO THIS IS BEEN THE CONSTANT DEBATE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND IN THE STATE IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. ABOUT THE- UC AND THEN AND LATER ON SEE IF YOU JUST DETERMINE TO MOVE WITH THE SUBJECT COURSE PATTERN AT THE WEIGHT IN THE WAY THAT IT IS. IS THAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND UNIVERSITY MINISTRY. AND LEGISLATORS ALL AGREED THAT IT POLITICALLY EASIER TO DO THAT THAN TO RACE THE TEST SCORE REQUIREMENT OR THE GPA REPORT OR THE GPA. CUT OFF SUPPORT. AND SO THAT THIS THIS THIS TENSION BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ELIGIBILITY WAS BAKED INTO THAT PLAN. BUT REMEMBER IT'S BASIC MAKING THAT PLAN BECAUSE THE PLAN. A FIRM REALLY WHICH WAS INTENDED WHICH HE OF A REDUCTION IN TOTAL IN TOTAL OUT AND TOTAL ACCESS TO THE TO THE SYSTEM. NOW FROM THAT FROM FROM THE POINT OF THE ACCREDITATION BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE TWO PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. OF HIGH SCHOOLS THE TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OF AT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THE CARD LIMóN EXPECTATIONS OF THE CAKE SYSTEM AND AT EACH POINT WHEN. THE SUBJECT MATTER PATTERN WAS CREATED. ALTHOUGH IT AT THAT TIME IT WILL. WELCOME BY K. TWELVE EDUCATION BECAUSE IT WAS AT LEAST LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN LADY OF THE LAKE IN THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AND NOT NOT TEACHING THE- CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE. SO IT WAS A RELAXATION OF THE OF THE- OF THE HEAVY HANDED. CURRICULUM AND INTERFERENCE OF THE NIVERSITY AT THAT TIME. BUT SINCE THAT POINT THAT THE DEBATE HAS BEEN ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL COURSES. AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ON THE ABILITY OF KATE WILL TO DELIVER. ON THE ADVISABILITY OF WHETHER CABLE SHOULD CHOOSE THAT PATTERN. AND WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS CAN CAN CAN COOK. COMPLETED AND- AND SO THAT THIS HAS BEEN THAT THE DEBATE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE EVERY TIME WHEN THE WHEN THE- WHEN THE- UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA AND SEE IF. THE DOCTOR THE ELIGIBILITY INDEX THAT CSU HAD PIONEERED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VASCONCELOS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY ONE TREATY HUGHES IS THE CHAIR OF. THIS COMMITTEE. HELD A LOT OF HEARINGS ON THAT TOPIC SAYING THAT THE ELIGIBILITY INDEX ITSELF THAT COMBINATION. SCORES AND GPA WAS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE. ACCESS FOR UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. AT THAT TIME AND THEN THEY HELP THE ANOTHER SET A LEGISLATOR HELD AN EQUIVALENT HEARING THE FOLLOWING DECADE WHEN CSU TURN THOSE. MARMOTS UP. AND K. TWELVE A AND YOU'LL HEAR A LOT. OF DEBATE IMPERFECTIONS IN. CASCADE WILD. IN GENERAL I HAVE TO MOST OF THE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH OVERTIME. AND SO HAVE STUDENTS A PART OF THE PART OF THE POLICY QUESTION THAT THAT YOU FACE IS. WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD. AND WHERE THAT'S ADVISABLE. I THINK I POINT OUT IT WHICH IS OFTEN LOST IN THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT. IT HAS WORKED IN THE REVERSE TO. SO WHEN THE WHEN THE K. TWELVE SAYS WHEN KATE TWELVE DETERMINE. THEIR IN THE FORTHCOMING CORD DROPPED THE DROP FOR THE ELEVENTH GRADE ASSESSMENT. THE CS USE ABILITY TO OFFER THE EARLY. DEMOCRATS OUT. ALSO DISAPPEARED SORT OF UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM. AT AT THE LAST. MOMENT THE ADOPTION OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM WHICH HAD. TAX EVASION RATES ALSO AFFECTED ELIGIBILITY. NOW WHY BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHENEVER YOU WERE YOU AFFECT THE GRADUATION RATE. YOUR AFFECTING THE L. BECAUSE THE ELDERLY RATE IS JUST IT IS A RATE. WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY BEING ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHICH IT IS OF COURSE BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE NOMINATOR OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE. IT'S OF THEIR FEWER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BECAUSE OF MORE PEOPLE CANNOT GET TO THE DIPLOMA DUE TO THE- HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM. A LARGER SHARE OF THEM ARE LIKE ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM WHICH WAS NOT A COLLABORATION AMONG EDUCATION VERY FEW THINGS EVER ARE BETWEEN K. TWELVE HIGHER ED. AFFECT DROVE UP THE ELIGIBILITY RATE WHICH THEN FORCED YOU SEEN SEATS YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THEY NEED TO INCREASE THEIR ADMISSION STANDARDS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THOSE DRAMATICALLY CUT AFFECTED. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE ELIGIBILITY PULLS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. THE SIZE OF THE POOL AND THE RATE THE NUMBER THAT IT IS RELATIVE TO THAT. 33% THAT IS IN THAT IS IN THE MASTER PLAN. SO THAT THAT THAT THAT'S COME BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BETWEEN THIS AND EVEN THE H. AG FOR ALL MOVEMENT. ON THAT THAT'S WHAT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. HAS THAT SAME EFFECT TO THE EXTENT THAT EVERY STUDENT IN SAN JOSE. OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETE. A TO G. CORRECT I'M FOR YOU TO SEE AN FOR CSU. THAT IF EVERYONE DOES AT THE GRADUATE THEN BECOMES NO LONGER A SORT MACINNES. FOR L. ELIGIBLE. DETERMINAR GREAT I BY. A AND SCORES. SO I BET BYE BACK NOT GIVING YOU ANY ANSWER. TO SIMPLY TO POINT OUT THIS THIS FUNDAMENTAL TENSION THAT EXISTS ON TWO LEVELS ONE IS BETWEEN. BETWEEN GPA TEST SCORES AND THE SUBJECT PATTERN AND THE SECOND IS THE TENSION BETWEEN. ACCESS AND THE ELIGIBILITY THE IDEA OF THE ELIGIBILITY POOLS AS A STATE POLICY UNCODIFIED STATE POLICY REDUCES THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION SAID THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNANCE ISSUES HAVE ALSO CHANGED SO IN THE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES DURING THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS IT WAS THE TWO ACADEMIC SENATE'S OF THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT STILL HAD PRIMACY OVER ADMISSIONS POLICY. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE ELIGIBILITY POLLS WERE NOT PUT INTO STATUTE WAS THERE WAS A RECOGNITION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND BY. THE BOARDS OF THE REGIONS IN THE TRUSTEES THAT THAT THAT EL ADMISSIONS WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY AN ACADEMIC POLICY MATTER AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE IS A SHOULD BE PROTECTED AGAINST INTERFERENCE BY. THE BY THE PLEASURE IN THE IN THE SEVENTIES HOWEVER AS MORE CAMPUS IT BECAME IMPACTED ACADEMIC SENATE'S COULD NO LONGER CONDUCT ALL OF ADMISSIONS POLICY PRACTICE BY THEMSELVES. AND SO DID THE DELEGATION OF DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO SELECT FROM THE ELIGIBILITY POOL AT BERKELEY OR UCLA OR AT SAN DIEGO STATE BEGAN TO BE DELEGATED FROM. THE ACADEMIC SENATE STATEWIDE DOWN TWO CAMPUSES AND THE ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION STARTED TO RISE AND SO THAT TODAY IT'S A MIX OF BOTH THE SENATE'S PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN. THE IN THE BROAD POLICY OF ADMISSIONS BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE IN IN IN IN IN IN IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND THE CHOICES THAT ARE MADE. THE SECOND THING THAT OCCURRED TO THE SECOND AB PATTERN THAT OCCURRED WAS IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES A STRONG EFFORT BY MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURE TO IT TO ENCOURAGE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE MISSIONS POOL. THAT WAS AN ISSUE IN NINETEEN IN THE SIXTIES BUT BUT RELATIVELY RELATIVELY MODEST IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES IT BECAME A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. A CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS AND ONE STATUTE SORT OF ESTABLISHING THAT IT WAS THE GOAL THAT THIS THAT THE TWO UNIVERSITIES SHOULD STRIVE TO APPROXIMATE A REFLECT ON THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA POPULATION HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. IT AT DIFFERENT TIMES THEY THEY DID NOT CHOOSE. TO PASS A LAW MANDATING A SPECIFIC SET OF ADMISSIONS POLICIES BUT THEY SAID. THAT AS A AS AN IMPORTANT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAD SERIOUSLY BEEN INVOLVED IN ADMISSIONS POLICY. IN QUITE A LONG TIME AND THEN MORE PERHAPS MORE NOTORIOUSLY AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WHEN. IF THE REGION'S A PARTICULAR SB ONE THE READ WHEN THE REGION'S ADOPTED THEIR POLICY TO ESSENTIALLY TO REVOKE ALL OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES. IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE GOV BY GOVERNOR WILSON AT THAT TIME ESSENTIALLY ORDERING HIGHER EDUCATION TO STOP USING RACE AS A FACTOR IN ADMISSIONS. CAUSED OTHER TO BE BOTH SIGNIFICAN ABOUT PUT WHAT WHAT THE CONSTRUCTION MIKE CONTEMPLATED POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN EMISSIONS BUT ALSO A LOT OF PUSH BACK ABOUT THAT IT THAT THAT QUESTION AS WELLSO. THE LESSON AROUND GOOD GOVERNANCE IS THAT THE ECONOMIC SENATE'S AND FACULTY OF TRADITIONALLY HAD THAT RESPOND TO BE THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ON ALL SIDES OF THIS OF THIS QUESTION THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. SOME ABRASIONS AROUND THE EDGES SO IF. I COULD JUST LEAVE IT THAT THAT THAT THAT THINK THINK THINK THE TO KEEP POLICY QUESTIONS I THINK THAT THAT THAT OUR THAT OUR HEAD OF YOU BRIT LARGE AGAIN I'M I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT YOUR ISSUE AT ALL. ONE IS THERE THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITIES IN. THE GUIDANCE OF K. TWELVE UP BOTH DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS BUT ALSO STUDENTS AND EXPERIENCES IN THE CHOICES THAT THEY ARE MAKING IN K. TWELVE. AND THE THERE THE RECORD IS. IS NEXT AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH HISTORY BUT THERE'S BUT THIS IS A POLICY CHOICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE CONSIDERING. AND THE SECOND IS. IS THE ARE THE ELIGIBILITY PULLS THEMSELVES AND- WE HAVE AS WITH WE'VE TAKEN AS THE AS THE GOSPEL BUT NOT GOSPEL ENOUGH TO WRITE THE STATUTE. THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE WILL ALWAYS BE SETTING THE POOL OF BY A YOUNG BE OF YOUNG PEOPLE CALIFORNIA THAT CAN GOING TO THE TO UNIVERSITIES BASED ON. A FIXED PROPORTION OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES NO MATTER HOW WELL PREPARED THEY ARE. NO NO MATTER HOW MUCH MORE ADVANCED THEY MIGHT BE FROM A GENERATION AGO WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THIS FIXED LIMITATION FROM THE TWELVE AND HAVE IN THE THIRD. BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES TREES USE KERRY. LEGISLATION TO CHANGE THE TWELVE AND A HALF FIVE. THE LEGISLATURE IS DOLLY WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE BUT THE COST IMPLICATIONS ARE NOT. TRIVIAL EITHER AND SO. THE POLICY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU REALLY IS. THAT FUNDAMENTAL IS ONE OF THEM IS THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY POOLS BECAUSE WE DON'T DEAL WITH THEM. THEN YOU WILL CONSTANTLY DEALING WITH WELL WHAT ARE THE RATIONING MECHANISMS WHAT ARE THE SORTING MECHANISMS IF IT'S NOT SUBJECT COURSES. IS A G. P. A.'S BUT NOT GPA SHOULD BE TEST SCORES. AND ALL OF THEM HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THAT ARE FOR OR IN FRONT OF YOU SO. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS CHEN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAPPEN. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF FOR YOUR INSIGHTFUL AND EDUCATIONAL PRESENTATION. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION I HAVE VISITED MANY CSU CAMPUSES. AND I AFFIRM THE WORK OF THE DEDICATED FACULTY ADMINISTRATION AND STAFF WELL IT MISSION NUMBERS REFLECT THE GROWTH AND CSU I KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE WERE TURNED AWAY. DUE TO CAPACITY ISSUES. KNOWING THAT WE WANT KNOWING THAT WE WANT MORE STUDENTS TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. DOCTOR GO BALD AND DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM AND CSU TO ACCEPT MORE STUDENTS. AND IF SO IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN CREATIVELY UPDATE THE MASTER PLAN TO CHANGE THE NEEDS FOR THIS CENTURY AND THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS WE NOW HAVE. THE ADDICT WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE NATIONAL IMPAIRED AND SENSES THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SCALABLE I'M AT THE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL INTO THE WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN CREATE MORE SAN DIEGO STATES IN UCLA'S STRESSED OUT OF WITH THE SNAP OF FINGERS IS A- THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION. BUT IN TERMS OF THE ELIGIBLE IT'S SERVING THE ELIGIBLE GRADUATES IN CALIFORNIA IN SOME WAY THE OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS THE STATE AND THE SYSTEMS HAVE HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY CAN'T SCALE. AND IN THE IN THE TIDAL WAVE TO WHEN THAT WAS APPROACHING AND THE LEGISLATURE'S GRAPPLING WITH EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUES AS I SAID CENTER ASSEMBLYMEMBER HUGHES DID CARRY LEGISLATION TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY POLLS AND AT THAT TIME BOTH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA. STATE UNIVERSITY CAME FORWARD WITH WITH BURKE WITH PLANS TO CONSTRUCT MANY MORE CAMPUSES YOU SEE THREE AT ONCE IN THE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES NOT THAT ALL RIGHT GOT REDUCED AND MERCED. BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE POLICY CONVERSATION WHIZZING WAS FULLY ENGAGED BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE TO UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO SCALE TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST THE MAGIC ARBITRARINESS OF THE OF. THE OF THE 33% ELIGIBILITY. FOR NINETEEN SIXTY. AND ONE MORE QUESTION I WAS A HISTORY TEACHER. AT THE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. AND AS I LOOK AT UNITED STATES HISTORY. AS IT PERTAINS TO THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES IT HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT FROM VERY LIMITED. TO EXPAND IN THE RIGHT TO VOTE RIGHT GOING FROM JUST PROPERTY OWNERS WHITE PROPERTY MAIL OWNERS OF PROPERTY. RIGHT TO GIVING AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN. WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE EXPANDING THAT RIGHT I HAVE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES THE SAME KIND OF TRAJECTORY. IN WHO DO WE THINK WOULD BENEFIT FROM GOING TO COLLEGE. RIGHT WHEN COLLEGES WERE FIRST CREATED. WE HAD YOU KNOW HARVARD IN THE IVY LEAGUE IN PRINCETON WHERE IT WAS. BASICALLY WEALTHY MAN WHAT THE AGAIN WEALTHY WHITE MEN GOING TO COLLEGE WE'VE EXPANDED THAT AND WE'VE DONE THAT HISTORICALLY. THE SAME PROJECTOR. EXCEPT FOR THE YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WHERE WE WENT BACK ON DIVERSITY WITH THE BACCHAE DECISION AND PROP TWO OH NINE. IT'S BEEN A MOVEMENT THAT DIRECTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO WAY AND COULD YOU WEIGH IN ON WHAT YOU THINK THIS A PROPOSAL BY CSU WHICH WAY DOES THAT MOVES. NO I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT LIKE TO WAIT. WAIT WAIT WAIT IN ON ON ON THAT POINT BUT IF YOU YOU KNOW I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK THAT IF EVERYONE IN SAN JOSE OR LA OR THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ADOPTED A TO G. FOR ALL IF EVERYONE COMPLETES A TO G. AND GRADUATES AND ACHIEVE THAT GPA. AND TEST SCORE STAYED THE SAME THEN WHAT IS THE POLICY BASIS FOR SAYING THAT I'D SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE GOING ON TO UNIVERSITY I THINK THAT'S THAT IN OTHER THAN THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA TERMS OF TAXATION AND- THE WAR AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT OTHER REASON IS THERE. OF FOR DOING THAT SO IT I THINK IN SOME SUCH AS IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN THAT IN THAT STUDENTS HAVE BEEN STUDENTS FROM THE FROM THESE VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS IN PLACES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN ACHIEVING AT LEVELS THAT. ARE TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS NICK NICK YOU KNOW NEAR GENIUS ACHIEVEMENTS THE LEVEL OF BOTH SUBJECT MATTER COMPLETION GRADES AND TEST SCORES. AND YET WE HAVE PRODUCED IN WITH KEPT UP WE'VE ARTIFICER MARK ARBITRARILY KEPT DOWN THE TOTAL NUMBER SO WHAT. YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WHILE ACHIEVEMENT HAS GONE UP. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE AS REMAIN SOMEWHAT CONSTANT. YES THAT BUT BY DEFINITION IT'S IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE AT AND I'M I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE A WHITE BOARD BUT- I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THAT AND MA'AM I'M SURE SOMEBODY ELSE BY THE TESTIMONY LATER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAJECTORY OF STUDENT ELIGIBILITY OVERTIME. WELL I MEAN WHAT YOU SEE IS THERE IS A RISE AS STUDENT AT SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS ACHIEVE. HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPECTATIONS. SCORES GRADES AND COURSE COMPLETIONS. RISING AND GETS ABOVE 33% OF THE THIRTY FIVE IS A THIRTY SIX. AND THEN OF POLICY THAN A SOMETHING CHANGES EITHER THE INDEX GOES UP TEST SCORES AND GPA OR OF COURSE GETS OR OR TWO OR THREE GETS ADDED. AND IT IMPLEMENTS. AND IT'S OUR STRIDES BACK AGAIN. AND THEN IT HAS TO BE KEPT UNDER CONTROL THAT IMPLEMENTS AGAIN IT'S A THIS IS THE STORY OF. OF ADMISSIONS. IN SOME SENSE IT'S A ADDS THAT HAPPENED A BOTH UC AND CSU BUT IT'S A STARKER PICTURE AT CSU. BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS THAT STUDENTS. STERN TO SCHOOLS HAVE DONE HAVE HAVE RESPONDED BETTER TO SEE IF YOU. THAT THAT THEIR LEVEL THEIR RATES OF IMPROVEMENT. IN IN A TREATMENT ALONG WITH MANY OF THESE INDICATORS HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN YOU SEE AND SO. SEE IF YOU EVERY TIME THEY'VE MADE ONE OF THESE CHANGES STUDENTS HAVE. FIRST DECLINE IN THE REBOUND AND GOD EVEN FARTHER WHERE'S THE UC LINE IS MUCH MORE SMOOTH WITH OTHER OVERTIME. YEAH THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IN IN IN ACHIEVEMENT MARRIED WITH CHANGING THE DEMOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA. THAT TOGETHER WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A MUCH LOW IF YOU SAID HERE'S THE STANDARD THE STANDARD OF ACADEMIC SUCCESS NO PREPARATION. NINETY STATE THAT. TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN MANY MANY MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS WHO WOULD BE WHO WOULD MEET THAT STANDARD. BUT. NOT ELIGIBLE BE IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL. IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL REYES. YEAH I KNOW CAN GO FOR THIS FOR. A COUPLE HOURS THAT BUT I'M INTEREST THE NEXT POINT BUT I GUESS THIS REALLY IS THE KEY QUESTION IS THAT. IS POINT. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AWAY TO RATION ACCESS. OR IS IT REALLY. A TOOL TO HELP THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO CSU. GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. HAVE A REALIZATION WITH THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF OUR GRADUATES BUT HE HAS NOT LOST UPON YOU THAT THAT REPORT THAT I THINK SEE IF THEY GIVE US A COUPLE. YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT. AT A TIME WHEN THE UNIVERSITY IN OUR- STUDENTS ARE ARE THE MOST DIVERSE EVER IS THIS TIME WORST SCHOOL IS. YOU KNOW THE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EVER. IT'S MORE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY SETTING. BUT BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE DEGREE. GAP WHERE WE NEED MORE MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES. AND MORE AND MORE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL WITH THEIR A TO G. REQUIREMENTS IT IT IT TALKS ABOUT. YOU KNOW DO WE NEED TO RE LOOK AT OUR THOSE 33% NUMBERS. ARBITRARY AND I THINK THAT WHAT WHAT THIS PROPOSAL SOME WOULD SAY IS THIS JUST A WAY. TO MANAGE WITHIN THE 33% RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAD IF THE IF THE CAT IF A WHAT IF WE IF WE WERE. HAD MONEY TO ACCEPT ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND HAD A POLICY THE DICK THAT ACCEPTED. THE TOP 50% WOULD BE REALLY BECOMING FOR WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND I GUESS THAT'S FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT. YOU WANT TO FIND UPON THAT YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT THE END OF IT THAT IS A PART OF THE QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT YOU'RE BUT I BUT I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT BOTH OF THESE FACTORS ARE IN PLACE SO YOU'LL HEAR. THE AND I% WAS REALLY NOT THE ONLY THING DRIVING THIS QUESTION PREPARATION AROUND QUANTITATIVE REASONING IS ALSO AND DO YOU KNOW TO BE BALANCED AND THAT THAT THE HISTORY OF THIS AS HAS BEEN THAT STUDENTS HAVE. TWO TWO EIGHT TWO EIGHT EIGHT NONTRIVIAL EXTENT ADJUSTED AND MET THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RISEN HAVE RISEN EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SHOULD BE THE CSU BOARD THAT MAKES THAT DETERMINATION FOR SCHOOLS AND FOR AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHETHER OR NOT WHILE THE BOLLOCKS DIPPING YOU KNOW WHO'S WHO'S LOST THROUGH WHO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS OTHER STILL POLICY QUESTION FOR YOU. BUT BOTH OF THESE BOTH OF THESE ARE IN PLAY BECAUSE THAT THAT THE CHANCE IF YOU IS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE INTELLIGIBILITY TARGET TODAY AND SO IF THEY DON'T USE COURSES AND YOU DON'T CHANGE THE ELIGIBILITY POOLS. THE UNDER UNDER THE MASTER PLAN THEN UNLESS A NEW A NEW RATIONING DEVICES IS ADMITTED AND THEN THEN WE'RE INVITING THEM TO SAY THAT THAT THE TEST SCORE. A THRESHOLD OR THE GPA THRESHOLD SHOULD SHOULD GO UP ON ABSENT A NEW TOOL. OKAY THANK. YOU WELL THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. TO THE CAPITAL. CHECK WE WILL THEN BRING UP. THE NEXT PANEL. LOOKING INTO THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING AND SEE AS USE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PROPOSAL SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP NATHAN EVANS CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JAMES MINOR ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLORS SENIOR STRATEGIST FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE. AND MARK HE. BUT KEEP THE GRANT MY CHINA GRAY KNOWN SHY THANK YOU SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NATHAN EVANS AND I SERVE AS SAID CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OFFICE THE CHANCELLOR JOINING ME THIS AFTERNOON AS YOU'VE HEARD DOCTOR MARKET AGREE NOT SHIRE SYSTEM BY CHANCE A PREDICATE OUR PREPARATION AND PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND DR JAMES MINOR SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR AND SENIOR STRATEGIST WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF GERMANY AS INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC AND FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY. AS THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE NATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. IS COMMITTED TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS. THE GAPS BETWEEN DEGREE PAYMENT FOR STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN THEIR PEERS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE UNIVERSITY. ONE OF THE GREATEST HURDLES TO COLLEGE DEGREE ATTAINMENT IS A STUDENTS LEVEL OF ACADEMIC PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSEWORK UPON ENTRY. AND US IT WAS THE FIRST AREA OF FOCUS FOR US IN THE TWENTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AS PART OF GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. QUANTITATIVE REASONING SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNER. AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE EMERGING AND CHANGING FUTURE OF WORK NO MATTER THE JOB OR BUSINESS SECTOR. SIMPLY PUT QUANTITATIVE REASONING IS THE ABILITY AND THE PRACTICE OF THINKING AND REASONING ANALYTICALLY AND INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT MEASUREMENT. DIMENSIONS DESIGNED CAPACITY OR PROBABILITY BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY THROUGHOUT LIFE TODAY. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S AN INCREASINGLY COME IN IN A MORE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX FUTURE OF WORK IN SOCIETY. I WANT TO REITERATE THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING IS NOT NECESSARILY SYNONYMOUS WITH MATHEMATICS ALL TOO OFTEN WE'VE HEARD THIS DISTILLED INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT A FOURTH YEAR OF MATH AND THAT IT IS NOT. RATHER IT'S THE CONFLUENCE OF CRITICAL THINKING MATHEMATICS AND REAL WORLD APPLICATION. QUANTITATIVE REASONING SKILLS REPRESENT ONE OF THE GREATEST DISPARITIES AMONG INCOMING COLLEGE STUDENTS TO OFTEN QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION DISPARITIES IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS EXACERBATE EQUITY GAPS THE PAULA STUDENTS TO COLLEGE. AND INFLUENCE THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER OPTIONS. STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION HIGH SCHOOL IN EVERY REGION OF THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS ALL ETHNIC GROUPS EXPERIENCE GREATER SUCCESS IN COLLEGE. THIS PREPARATION ALSO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE WORK FORCE REGARDLESS OF THEIR FIELD OF INTEREST. THE C. ISSUES ABILITY TO PRODUCE A GREATER NUMBER OF DIVERSE COLLEGE GRADUATES PREPARED FOR A RANGE OF PROFESSIONS IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS AND CLOSING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS A LARGE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM REQUIRES COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP AND BOLD ACTION THAT ADVANCES THE METRIC MISSION OF THE INSTITUTION. THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE BEFORE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WILL HELP ACHIEVE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY BY ENSURING THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS ARRIVE AT THE C. ISSUE BETTER PREPARED FOR A DIVERSE RANGE OF MAJORS AND CAREER PATHS. THE GOAL IS TO EXPAND ACCESS AND EQUITY FOR ALL STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS RATHER THAN LIMITING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES AT THE POINT OF COLLEGE ADMISSION BECAUSE OF LIMITED PREPARATION. FOR PARTICULAR MAJORS DURING HIGH SCHOOL. THE C. ISSUE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS TO PUT IMPROVE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IN COLLEGE. FROM A GROUNDBREAKING HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR ENGLISH COURSE CO DEVELOPED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO BY SEE ISSUE IN HIGH SCHOOL FACULTY. NOW OFFERED A MORE THAN A THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOLS STATEWIDE TO THE MORE THAN SEVENTY MILLION ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN K. TWELVE OUTREACH. TO SEE ISSUES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS FIFTIETH YEAR. OUR COMMITMENT AND PARTNERSHIP TO ADDRESS EDUCATIONAL EQUITY ARE EMBEDDED IN THE MISSION INTERACTIONS EACH DAY. IN THE COURSE OF ALL OF OUR COMMENTS TODAY MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN FIRST YEAR ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS BEGINNING IN% TWENTY TWENTY SIX. UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. SURE THE CONTEXT ON THE RESEARCH DATA AND RATIONALE UNDERPINNING THE PROPOSAL. ADDRESS THE INPUT ANTICIPATED AT IMPACT ON FUTURE STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF EXISTING AND PLANNED SUPPORTS FOR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE SEA ISSUE. LET ME BEGIN WITH THE PROPOSAL ITSELF. AS YOU'VE HEARD AND YOU KNOW THIS CSU AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN SUBJECT AREAS FOR ADMISSIONS. AS A FIRST YEAR STUDENT FOLLOWING HIGH SCHOOL KNOWN TODAY AS A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS. THESE SUBJECT AREAS INCLUDE FOUR YEARS OF ENGLISH THREE YEARS OF MATHEMATICS TWO YEARS OF SCIENCE TWO YEARS OF SOCIAL SUCH SOCIAL STUDIES OR HISTORY. TWO YEARS OF A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH ONE YEAR OF VISUAL PERFORMING ARTS AND ONE ADDITIONAL COLLEGE PREP PREPARATORY ELECTED. AGAIN THIS TOTALS FIFTEEN SUBJECT REQUIRE REQUIRED OVER FOUR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL. OF IMPORTANT NOTE THE AVERAGE BOTH MEDIAN AND MEAN. NUMBER OF EIGHT THREE G. COURSES COMPLETED BY STUDENTS WHO ENROLL AT THE CSU TODAY IS ALREADY TWENTY ONE COURSES. SIX MORE THAN THAT MINIMUM. THE CSU IS PROPOSING TO REQUIRE THE COMPLETION OF ONE QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE. BEYOND THE EXISTING TO YOUR SCIENCE REQUIREMENT AND THE THREE YOUR MATH REQUIREMENT. FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN A TO G. COURSES SO EFFECTIVELY WE'RE ASKING STUDENTS WITHIN THAT TWENTY ONE COURSE AVERAGE. TO ADJUST THAT REMAINING FIVE COURSES TO TAKE ONE QUANTITATIVE REASONING WITHIN THOSE. THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT COULD BE FILLED WITH AN ADDITIONAL HI YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE. AND ELECTED WITH QUANTITATIVE REASONING FOUNDATIONS SUCH AS PERSONAL FINANCE DATA SCIENCE OR COMPUTER SCIENCE OR A MORE TRADITIONAL MATHEMATICS COURSE BEYOND ALGEBRA TWO LIKE STATISTICS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IN THE HAND OUT WE SHARED. IT CAN ALSO BE MET WITH A QUANTITATIVELY BASED COURSE OFFERED TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION LIKE AGRIBUSINESS GAME DESIGN SPORTS MEDICINE OR ACCOUNTING. OR TO DO ONE MOMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONLINE VERSIONS OF COURSES MAY ALSO BE AN OPTION FOR MANY STUDENTS. THE IDEAS THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKE THE NEXT APPROPRIATE QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE DISTRICT IN PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSE WORK AND CAREER READINESS. BASED ON THEIR INTERESTS. AND WHILE IT WOULD BE RECOMMENDED THAT THE STUDENTS TAKE THE COURTS IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR IT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY TO STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE TO IMPORTANT OTHER POINTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. FIRST THE REQUIREMENT WOULD TAKE EFFECT AND SEVEN YEARS FOR ENTERING NEW FIRST YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THOSE STUDENTS ARE IN SIX GRADE TODAY. ADDITIONALLY BASED ON THE CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF AND CONSISTENT WITH CAST CHANGES IN ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS. THE CSU WILL PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FOR ANY STUDENT WHO IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR ADMISSION WHO COULD NOT FILL THIS NEW REQUIREMENT DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES AND COURSE AVAILABILITY AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UC AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SCHOOLS WITH LIMITED QUALIFYING COURSE OFFERINGS IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX WOULD BE PRE IDENTIFIED. AND STUDENTS ATTENDING THESE SCHOOLS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT IF IT IS NEEDED. THIS WILL AUTOMATE THE EXEMPTION FOR STUDENTS APPLYING FROM THE SCHOOLS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS TO SEEK OUT SUCH A WAIVER. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT AS WITH THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A TO G. REQUIREMENTS WAIVERS WOULD BE PHASED OUT OVER TIME. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HAPPENED CSU GRADUATES ARRIVE AS TRANSFER STUDENTS AND% THUS THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON TRANSFERRED MISSION OR FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS THEMSELVES. WITH THIS WITH THE CONTEXT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF I'LL NOW TURN TO DR MARKET AGREE NO SHIRE. TO ADDRESS THE ORIGINS AND INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL GET A. THANK YOU NATHAN AGAIN MY NAME IS MARK HIT A CAR NO SHIRE AYE SERVICES SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATOR PREPARATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THE CSU. IN REALITY THE DISCUSSION REGARDING PRE COLLEGE ACADEMIC PREPARATION NECESSARY FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUCCESS IN THE CSU HAS BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION FOR DECADES AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THE CURRENT A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS FOR CSU ADMISSION. HAVE REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS YET THE PREPARATION NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A RANGE OF DEGREE PROGRAMS THE WORK FORCE AND VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE HAS CHANGED FOR THIS GENERATION OF STUDENTS. EVEN AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE MINIMUM A THREE G. HIGH SCHOOL COURSE REQUIREMENTS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO BOTH THE C. AND C. ISSUE AND YOU SEE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT STUDENTS EXCEED THOSE MINIMUMS. TO BE BEST PREPARED FOR DIRECT DEGREE COMPLETION AND ACCESS TO THE BROADEST RANGE OF MAJORS SPECIFICALLY BOTH SEGMENTS HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE FOUR YEARS OF MATHEMATICS SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. IN ADDITION IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THE CSU IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ONCE THE EARLY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM WHICH USE THE STATE SUMMIT OF HIGH SCHOOL ASSESSMENT. THEN THE STAR EXAM AND NOW THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIGNAL OF COLLEGE READINESS IN ENGLISH AND MATHEMATICS DURING THE JUNIOR YEAR OFHIGH SCHOOL. AS PART OF THAT PROGRAM THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO TOOK THAT ASSESSMENT WERE ENCOURAGED AND INCENTIVIZED TO TAKE A SENIOR YEAR MATHEMATICS COURSE. RECOGNIZING THE INCONGRUENCE ADMISSION CRITERIA AND COLLEGE READY YES THE STATE WIDE ACADEMIC SENATE AT THE CSU OR OFFICIAL FACULTY GOVERNANCE BODY. CREATED A TASK FORCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO EXAMINE ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING. THE TASK FORCE INCLUDED AMONG OTHERS THEN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM AND FORMER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT KERIK ASHLEY. AFTER TWO YEARS OF EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION AN INVESTIGATION ONE OF THE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE WAS TO REVISE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS FOR CSU ADMISSION. THE RECOMMENDATION CALLED FOR REVISED POLICY THAT EVALUATES THE GENERAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING ABILITY OF STUDENTS AND TRAIN AND GRADUATING FROM THE CSU. THE CSU SYSTEM HAS ALREADY ADVANCE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR REPORT FOR EXAMPLE AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT NEARLY ONE THIRD OF REGULAR ADMITTED CSU STUDENTS WERE ARRIVING UNDER PREPARED FOR COLLEGE LEVEL MATHEMATICS AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES. THE STUDENTS WERE RELEGATED TO NON CREDIT DEVELOPMENTAL AGES EDUCATION COURSES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS REMEDIAL COURSES COSTING THEM ADDITIONAL MONEY LENGTHENING THE TIME TURNER DEGREE AND ESSENTIALLY EXCLUDING THEM FROM ANY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS OR STEM DEGREE PROGRAMS. THE STUDENTS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN X. IN RESPONSE THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IT ADDRESS THREE MAIN ISSUES FIRST IT CHANGE THE WAY THIS IS TO ASSESS STUDENTS AT ENTRY AND PLACE THEM IN FIRST YEAR COURSES SECOND IT STRENGTHENED THE EARLY START PROGRAM TO ALLOW STUDENTS. WHO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO EARN CREDIT IN THE SUMMER BEFORE THEIR FIRST TERM AND THIRD IT ELIMINATED STANDALONE DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COURSES ALSO KNOWN AS REMEDIATION. WELL THE FIRST YEAR OF EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN IMPLEMENTATION HAS SHOWN POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS THE POLICY WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE THE SOLE COUNTERBALANCE FOR STUDENTS ARRIVING. UNDERPREPARED FOR VARIOUS COLLEGE LEVEL QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES THE C. ISSUES COMMITMENT IS TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND TO WORK SYSTEMATICALLY TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND COLLEGE READINESS FOR ALL INCOME IN STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE REASONING A MISH REQUIREMENT AS A PROGRESSIVE STEP IN ENSURING EQUITY AN AUTHENTIC ACCESS FOR ALL CSU STUDENTS. THE PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO CURTAIL ACCESS OR CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE CSU STUDENT POPULATION INSTEAD IS IT IT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE. THAT ALL STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE CSU OR THE MOST PREPARED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR COURSE WORK SO THAT THEY MAY PARTICIPATE IN A RANGE OF MAJORS AND CAREER FIELDS. AT THE CSU THE DATA ARE CLEAR THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION IN HIGH SCHOOL LEADS TO GREATER SUCCESS IN COLLEGE THIS IS TRUE WHETHER STUDENT MAJORS IN ART ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY OR DESIGN. IF WE APPLIED THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT TO THE ENTRANT CLASS A NEW FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE YEAR AGO. 91% OF THE MORE THAN SIXTY THREE THOUSAND HAD FULFILLED THE REQUIREMENTS. 91% WITH THE VAST MAJORITY FOR FILLING THAT REQUIREMENT TO THE COMPLETION OF A FOURTH YEAR MATH FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT THE IMPACT IS EVIDENT YOU CAN FIND A SUMMARY OF THAT IN OF THIS INFORMATION ON THE HANDOUT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED. THIS IMPACT IS SHOWN IN FIRST YEAR TO SECOND YEAR RETENTION RATES AND FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES AND IT'S SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES. STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR QUANTITATIVE REASONING BIT SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS ARE RETAINED AND GRADUATED GREATER RATES IN THOSE STUDENTS WHO ONLY COMPLETE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF A THROUGH G. COURSES. THIS IS TRUE FOR LAD NEXT STUDENTS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS INDEED FOR ALL STUDENTS THANK YOU. LOOKING AT FIRST YEAR RETENTION STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED AN ADDITIONAL YEAR IN QUANTITATIVE REASONING HIGH SCHOOL WERE RETAINED IN THEIR SECOND YEAR AT A RATE AT A RATE ELEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO ONLY COMPLETED. THE MINIMUM A THREE G. COURSES. AMERICANS. EIGHTY FIVE VERSES STUDENTS THE IMPROVEMENT WAS NEXT STUDENTS EIGHTY THREE VERSUS 71% WE ALSO SEE THE IMPACT ON GRADUATION RATES BOTH FOUR YEAR AND SIX YEAR FOR SIX YOUR RATES THE ONES ON WHICH EQUITY GAPS ARE MEASURED WE SEE GRADUATION RATES TWELVE POINTS HIGHER FOR STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED AN ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE WAS SIMILAR GAINS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN ELEVEN POINTS. AND LATIN NEXT STUDENTS TEN POINTS. LET ME PAUSE HERE TO ADDRESS A CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED REGARDING THE POTENTIAL DISPARATE IMPACT OF THIS POLICY ON BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS. THE CSU HAS LONG MONITOR THE ETHNIC AND RACIAL COMPOSITION OF OUR STUDENTS AND CHANGES WINCH WHICH IMPACT THIS. INCLUDING CHANGES TO FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING HOW STUDENT RACE AND ETHNICITY INFORMATION IS REPORTED PUBLICLY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSAN ETHNICITY AND RACE CHANGED WHEN WE EXAMINE THE ETHNICITY OF STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX PRIOR TO THE CHANGE AND COMPARATIVE TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FEDERALLY REPORTED PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE CSU WOULD APPEAR TO DECLINE FROM 6% TO FOUR PERCENT. HOWEVER IF WE TAKE A DEEPER LOOK INSIDE THESE NUMBERS WE SEE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTS DATA FOR BOTH BLACK HISPANIC AND BLACK MULTIRACIAL STUDENTS CATEGORY COMBINATIONS THAT DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND NINE. CHANGE IN THOSE STUDENTS NO LONGER WOULD WE- BE REPORTED UNDER BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN CATEGORY. IF WE CONSIDER THIS CONTEXT THE TRUE SHARE OR PERCENTAGE OF BLACK STUDENTS IN THE C. ISSUES UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES SPEAKING STUDENT POPULATION STANDS AND 6% AT STANDS AT 6% AND HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. IN REALITY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ROLL THIS FALL TWENTY NINETEEN. COMPARED TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. WITHOUT EXCEPTION CSU STUDENT OUTCOMES DATA SHOW THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION IN HIGH SCHOOL IS LINKED TO SUCCESS IN COLLEGE NO MATTER STUDENTS FEEL THE STUDY NO MATTER THEIR CAREER CHOICE ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION IS CRITICAL. THIS IS A PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR HIGH DEMAND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS STEM CAREERS. THESE ARE HIGH PAIN IN DEMAND JOBS BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. STEM OCCUPATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW BY NEARLY NINE PERCENT. THESE ARE CAREERS THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS WANT TO PURSUE. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY SEVENTEEN A C. T. REPORT 52% OF ALL A. C. TESTED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. INDICATED AN INTEREST IN PURSUING A CAREER AND STEM HOWEVER ONLY 31% MET MET THE ACT BENCHMARK FOR COLLEGE READINESS AND STEM. AND WHEN EXAMINED BY ETHNICITY TO PROTECT THE PICTURE IS WORSE ONLY 11% OF BLACK NECKS AND 10% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE PREPARED TO PURSUE STEM MAJORS IN COLLEGE WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT THE DOORS TO STEM CAREERS ARE ESSENTIALLY CLOSE TO STUDENTS. AND PRIMARILY STUDENTS OF COLOR BEGINNING IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. THIS TREND CONTINUES THROUGH COLLEGE AT THE CSU DISPARITIES IN STEM GRADUATES EXISTS DESPITE PROGRESS IN CLOSING EQUITY GAPS. CONSIDER THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN A STEM FIELD WITHIN EACH ETHNIC GROUP IN 20171824% OF ASIAN STUDENTS. AND 23% OF WHITE STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN A STEM FIELD. HOWEVER ONLY 14% OF LATIN NECKS AND 10% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS EARNED A SIMILAR DEGREE. QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION IN HIGH SCHOOL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN A LIMITED ELIMINATING THIS DISPARITIES. SUPPORTING AUTHENTIC ACCESS TO STEM MAJORS IN CAREERS BY ENSURING STUDENTS ARRIVE AT COLLEGE BETTER PREPARED ACADEMICALLY TO PURSUE THESE FIELDS. WITH THIS CONTEXT IN MIND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT SUCH A CHANGE REQUIREMENTS DOES NOT IMPACT THE STUDENT'S IS MOST INTENDED TO SUPPORT. THROUGH CONSULTATION PARTNERSHIPS OF KICK P. K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE PROPOSAL TO ENSURE IT DOES NO HARM TO STUDENTS FROM A HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. FIRST MANY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS TODAY THAT ALIGN WITH THE CSU PROPOSAL IF WE LOOK AT THE TWENTY LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN ONE THIRD TODAY HAVE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AT A LINE WITH THE CSU QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL THIS INCLUDES FOUR OF THE FIVE LARGEST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE INCLUDING SAN DIEGO LONG BEACH OAK GROVE AND FRESNO UNIFIED AS WELL SAM OR DID YOU KNOW OAKLAND AND STOCKTON. AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM SEVERAL THE STATE'S SMALLEST SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO CURRENTLY HAVE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE CSU QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL AS WELL. THE STUDENTS IN THESE DISTRICTS INCLUDED BAKER VALLEY. TOOL LAKE IN FERNDALE WITH GRADUATING CLASSES SMALLER THAN FIFTY STUDENTS GRADUATE HAVING ALREADY FOR FILLED THE PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS. EVERY STUDENT GRADUATING FROM THOSE DISTRICTS HAS ALREADY FOR FILL THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS. SECOND EVERY COMPREHENSIVE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL TODAY OFFERS AT LEAST ONE QUALIFYING COURSE AND ALL BUT SIX SIXTEEN SCHOOLS OFFER AT LEAST THREE COURSES WITH MOST OF THOSE SIXTEEN BEING SMALL CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED TWENTY ONE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE IN WHICH SUFFICIENT CLASSES AND COURSE SECTIONS EXISTS BUT THE COURSE TAKING PAT. THE COURSE TAKING BEHAVIOR STUDENTS IN THESE JUST WOULD NEED TO CHANGE OVER THE INTERVENING SEVEN YEARS. AND FINALLY AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX SHOULD STUDENT NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COURSE TO THE RESOURCES OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. THEY WILL RECEIVE AN EXEMPTION LET ME BE COMPLETELY CLEAR UNDER THIS PROPOSAL NO STUDENT WOULD BE DENIED ACCESS TO THE CSU BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT TAKE A QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. DURING BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETINGS OVER THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS WE'VE DISCUSSED WHAT THIS PRACTICALLY WOULD MEAN TODAY AT A VARIETY OF TYPES OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS. WE EXAMINE COURSE CATALOGS AND A THROUGH G. LISTS FOR SCHOOLS RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN SPENDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND. AT FORTUNA HIGH SCHOOL A SMALL RURAL SCHOOL IN HUMBLE COUNTY THAN A ROLLS FEWER THAN A THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WE'RE MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. A REVIEW FOUND THAT A STUDENT IN ROLE TODAY WOULD HAVE FIFTEEN COURSES AVAILABLE TO FILL THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDE COURSES SUCH AS GREEN TECHNOLOGIES STATISTICS AND ANATOMY AND TWO COURSES OFFERED THROUGH DOING MOMENT WITH THE CALLER REDLANDS. PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS AN INTRO TO GAME DEVELOPMENT. NEXT AT RIVER CITY HIGH SCHOOL JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE IN WEST SACRAMENTO APPROXIMATELY 644% OF THE SCHOOLS TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE LUNCH MEALS. AT RIVER CITY STUDENTS TO ROLL TODAY HAVE TWENTY NINE COURSE OPTIONS TO FILL THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDE COURSES SUCH AS HUMAN BODY SYSTEMS DIGITAL ELECTRONICS AND COURSE ENTITLED FARM TO FORK. TURNING OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE DID A SIMILAR REVIEW OF COURSE OFFERINGS AT FRESNO HIGH SCHOOL IN FRESNO COUNTY. WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED AND ABOUT 85% ARE LATIN NECKS AFRICAN AMERICAN OR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. A STUDENT ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL HERE TODAY WOULD HAVE THIRTY SEVEN CLASSES THAT COULD FILL THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDES GENERAL COLLEGE PREPARATORY CLASSES HONORS CLASSES INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE COURSES AP CLASSES REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAM COURSES AND A WORK BASED LEARNING COURSE. IN THE HEART OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AT SOUTH KATE SENIOR HIGH NEARLY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED. FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS A STUDENT TAKING COURSES AT SENIOR SOUTH GATE SENIOR HIGH TODAY WOULD HAVE AT LEAST SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT COURSES THAT THEY COULD. TAKE TO FILL THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDE COURSES RANGING FROM EXPLORING COMPUTER SCIENCE TO BIOLOGY LIVING EARTH TO TRANSITION TO COLLEGE MATH AND STATISTICS. A TRANSITIONAL MATH SCORES THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH C. H. CSU NORTHRIDGE. AND FINALLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE REVIEW COURSE OFFERINGS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN ABOUT HALF OR LESS NEXT STUDENTS. A STUDENT ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL HERE WOULD HAVE TWENTY NINE DIFFERENT CLASSES THAT COULD FILL THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT. THIS INCLUDES CLASSES LIKE GAME DESIGN SPORTS MEDICINE IN MARINE BIOLOGY. THE INFORMATION I HAVE SHARED THIS FAR REFERENCES TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT THE DATA DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING FOR TODAY'S STUDENTS AND THE ACCESS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. YET THE PROPOSED CHANGE REQUIREMENTS WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN SEVEN YEARS FOR THE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THIS TIME WINE WAS SELECTED FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST IT ENSURES THAT ANY STUDENT ALREADY IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE POINT OF ADOPTION WOULD SEE NO CHANGE IN EXPECTED REQUIREMENTS. SECOND GIVING THIS GIVES STUDENTS GIVEN THAT STUDENTS ARE OFTEN BEGINNING BOTH TRADITIONAL INTEGRATED MATH CURRICULUM MORE FREQUENTLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. IT ALLOWS STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER MULTI YEAR PLANNING FOR SUCH A REQUIREMENT. AND FINALLY IT PROVIDES SUFFICIENT TIME TO FURTHER INVEST RESOURCES AN OUT REACH TO BUILD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. IN WHICH IT MAY MOST BE NEEDED. DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS OF CONSULTATION WE RECEIVE FEEDBACK THE P. K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE COURTS CAPACITY IN HIGH SCHOOLS TO MEET THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE LISTENED TO THIS FEEDBACK AND KNOWLEDGE THE IMPLEMENTING THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE A COLLECTIVE EFFORT. AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE A THREE G. REQUIREMENTS THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE P. KILLED P. K. TWELVE SCHOOLS TO MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR COURSE OFFERINGS. BUT CSU FACULTY AND STAFF WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK WITH THESE DISTRICTS AS PARTNERS OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS TO ENSURE THEY ARE READY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY SIX IMPLEMENTATION YEAR. WE WILL USE THE SUCCESSFUL EXPOSITORY READING AND WRITING CURRICULUM OR E. OR W. C. AS A MODEL TO EXPAND COURSE AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS. THE E. R. W. C. NOW OFFERED IN MORE THAN A THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOLS PROVIDE SENIORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE A FOURTH YOUR COURTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS. THE COURSES WERE CO DEVELOPED BY CSU IN HIGH SCHOOL FACULTY AND CAPACITY WAS EXPANDED BY COLLABORATIVE WE WORKING WITH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CURRICULAR INTEGRATION. WE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME MODEL AND BUILDING MORE TEACHING CAPACITY WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED INDEED THIS WORK FOR QUANTITATIVE REASONING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN CSU FACULTY AND STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND PK TWELVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS TO DEVELOP A BRIDGE OR TRANSITIONAL COURSE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA MATHEMATICS READ READING THIS CHALLENGES WHICH INITIATIVE OR CMR CI. THESE COURSES PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL WAY FOR STUDENTS TO MEET THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE REASONING PARLIAMENT. AND THESE COURSES CAN BE FOUND ACROSS THE STATE FROM NEVADA COUNTY IN THE NORTH TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN THE SOUTH. THESE PARTNERSHIPS WERE A DIRECT RESULT OF A TEN MILLION DOLLAR LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IT IS THIS EXACT TYPE OF SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION AND THE SCALING. OF THIS IMPORTANT WORK IN THE FUTURE. CURRENTLY THROUGH PARTNERSHIP AMONG CSU CAMPUSES AT MONTEREY BAY NORTHRIDGE SACRAMENTO SAN BERNARDINO POMONA LONG BEACH SAN JOSE AND SAN DIEGO NEW PILOT TRANSITIONAL COURSES EXIST IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WITH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THESE COURSES ANNUALLY. WE WILL CONTINUE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE COURSES AND WORK WITH DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO EXPAND THIS COURSE OFFERINGS. BEGINNING WITH THE DISTRICTS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS MOST IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE CSU AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXECUTED A NEW DATA SHARING AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT OUR WORK AROUND QUANTITATIVE REASONING. THIS AGREEMENT IS HELP US REFINE THE PROPOSAL AND WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT OUR CSU CAMPUS AND SYSTEM PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DURING IMPLEMENTATION. IN ADDITION A CREW IN ADDITION TO CURRICULAR SUPPORT THE CSU IN THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO INVEST IN GROWING THE NUMBER OF NEW PROTECTORS PRODUCED BY THE STATE PARTICULAR IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND OTHER HIGH NEED AREAS. CSU CHANCELLOR TIM WHITE HAS COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. TO PREPARE MORE TEACHERS IN STEM FIELDS THIS INVESTMENT IS ON TOP OF THE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION CURRENTLY INVESTED EACH YEAR BY THE CSU. ON AVERAGE THE CSU CURRENTLY PREPARES ABOUT A THOUSAND NEW MATHEMATICS MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHERS EVERY YEAR. MANY OF THESE TEACHERS GO ON TO TEACH IN THE STATE'S HIGH NEED SCHOOLS WERE 25% OR MORE. OF THESE STUDENTS COME FROM FAMILIES BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND MATHEMATICAL ACHIEVEMENTS RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WE ANTICIPATE THIS NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH INVESTMENT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ENROLL MORE TEACHER CANDIDATES. AND FINALLY THE CSU WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND IN SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP CURRENT P. K. TWELVE TEACHERS DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT CURRICULA FOR QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES. MANY OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE CSU CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF INSTRUCTION AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING. AT THIS TIME NOW TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE DR JAMES T. MINOR TO CONCLUDE OUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MARQUITA A GOOD AFTERNOON I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES OF SHARED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND- DURING THAT TIME AND I PROMISE YOU THAT MY PORTION OF THE TESTIMONY IS MUCH SHORTER. BUT I WANT TO SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY JUST A FEW KEY POINTS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS FIRST. IS THAT THE POWER THE PROPOSED POLICY IS ANCHORED IN OUR INSTITUTIONAL GOAL TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS. AND PROVIDE AUTHENTIC ACCESS TO THE SEA ISSUE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT ARRIVES WITH THE ACADEMIC PREPARATION THAT BASS POSITIONS THEM FOR SUCCESS. IT IS GRADUATING WITH A HIGH QUALITY DEGREE THAT TRANSFORMS THE LIVES OF SEE ISSUE STUDENTS NOT SIMPLY BE AND ADMIT IT. UNA WHO ARRIVES UNDERPREPARED HAS JUST ONE IN TEN CHANCE OF GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. THE PROPOSAL WAS NEVER CONCEIVED ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS AN APPARATUS FOR ADJUSTING A ROMAN. SECOND THE PROPOSAL WAS GROUNDED IN A RECOMMENDATION FROM AN INCLUSIVE REPORT BY SEE ISSUE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. OVER THE LAST. THREE YEARS THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SHAPED BY NATIONAL AND INTERNETWORK FORMAL SEE ISSUE BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEETINGS INCLUDING A SPECIAL FOR OUR HEARING. ARE ON THE TOPIC ON AUGUST TWENTY NINTH WHICH INCLUDED PANELS ARE REPRESENTING VARYING VIEWPOINTS MUCH LIKE TODAY'S HEARING. THIRD THE POLICY HAS BEEN ADAPTED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH FLEXIBILITY. STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE WHENEVER IT BEST FITS INTO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SCHEDULE THERE ARE NUMEROUS TYPES OF CLASSES THAT WILL FOR FEEL THIS REQUIREMENT AND SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY OFFERING A BROAD RANGE OF THOSE COURSES. AND THIS PROPOSAL ENSURES THAT NO STUDENT IS DENIED ACCESS TO THE SEA ISSUE BECAUSE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL LACKS THE RESOURCES TO OFFER QUALIFYING COURSES THE PROPOSAL WILL NOT HARM STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. LET ME JUST PAUSE TO ADDRESS THE R. T. I. STUDY THAT WAS FUNDED BY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND RESPONSE TO THIS PROPOSAL. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THESE GROUPS SHARE ARE INTERESTING COMMITMENT TO EDUCATIONAL EQUITY ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT AGREE ON THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THIS. WE LEARNED DURING THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IS HERE AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING LAST MONTH AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CONSIDERED R. T. EYES USE OF THE STUDENT DATA FROM THE LAST ELIGIBILITY STUDY TO BE A BREACH OF CONTRACT WITH CD. AND A BREACH OF STUDENT DATA. THAT SAID THE RTI STEADY USED A VERY LIMITED DEFINITION OF COURSES WHICH WAS SATISFY SEE ISSUES REQUIREMENTS ONLY ADVANCED MATH CLASSES OR PHYSICAL SCIENCES. PHYSICAL SCIENCE COURSES IN CONTRAST WITH THE BROAD RANGE FOR DEFINITION OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING ADVANCED AND SEE ISSUES PROPOSAL. AS A RESULT IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOUR YEARS AGO WOULD NOT OF SATISFIED A REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD TAKE THAT WOULD TAKE AFFECT SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN ALL STUDENTS ARE TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD. THE ISSUE DATED DEMONSTRATE THAT TODAY 91% OF NEW FIRST YEAR STUDENTS ALREADY COMPLETE A QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE ALREADY MEETING THE REQUIREMENT AT LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS. IN THE INTERVENING YEARS TO SEE ISSUE IS COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADDRESSED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY AS A FIRM BAR CHANCELLOR STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR MONITORED DISTRICT PREPARATION HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION OUTCOMES IN NEW STUDENT TRANS. THE C. ISSUE IS ALREADY EMBEDDED IN EXEMPTION PROCESS AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY MARQUITA. AND THE CSU TRUSTEES AND LEADERSHIP WERE ALSO RETAIN DISCRETION TO ADJUST THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE IF NECESSARY AS WE APPROACH TWENTY TWENTY SIX. FINALLY THE PROPOSED POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN PROVIDES P. K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS SUPPORT FROM THE C. ISSUE AND TIME TO PREPARE OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH THE DIRECTION OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE A LINE IN THERE REQUIREMENTS WITH CALIFORNIA NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS WILL THEREFORE. BE ALIGNED WITH THE C. ISSUE PROPOSAL. AND CALIFORNIA'S NEW ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND SCHOOLS ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION BASED ON A CONCISE SET OF MEASURES SIX OF WHICH WOULD BE DIRECTLY SUPPORTED BY THE ADOPTION OF A QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS. WITHOUT QUESTION ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING PREPARATION A HIGH SCHOOL INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A STUDENT WILL STAY IN ROLE TO. BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GRADUATE IT PREPARES THEM WITH THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE AND SUCCESSFUL IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FORCE NO MATTER THEIR CAREER PATH AND NO MATTER WHERE THEIR INTERESTS PASSIONS AND LIFE EXPERIENCES TAKE THEM. THE C. ISSUE WAS CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF STUDENTS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE C. ISSUES COMMITMENT TO AUTHENTIC ACCESS OPPORTUNITY AND SOCIAL MOBILITY. CHAIR MEDINA WE APPRECIATE THE TIME THIS AFTERNOON BUT YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US AND WE WILL WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE BEGIN SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL I JUST WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RAMOS FROM SAMBAR MEDINA THE MY IS JOINING. A DISTRICT SO WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER RAMOS. AND BEFORE I BEGIN MY QUESTIONS I WANT TO REITERATE SOMETHING AND THAT IS. WE WERE OVER HERE TOGETHER AWHILE BACK ETHNIC THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE AUDIT WAS CSU ON FINANCES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE AUDIT WAS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. AS IT CAME TO THE BUDGET. AND I'VE HEARD THAT YOU MENTION YOU KNOW THE LONG TIME THAT THAT CSU IS BENT AS SPENT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I WOULD REITERATE AGAIN THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH NEWS TO ME. AND A VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THIS COMMITTEE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO REFLECTED FROM OTHER SEGMENTS AS WELL. WITH THAT HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU ANSWER FIRST QUESTION. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. SALT SO LET ME JUST BEGAN AND I'LL INVITE MY COLLEAGUES THE PROBLEM THAT THIS PROPOSAL ARE SEEKS TO ADDRESS IS THE INCONGRUENCE AS YOUR HER MARQUITA MENTIONED BETWEEN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE C. ISSUE WHAT WE TODAY DEEM COLLEGE READY. JUST A YEAR AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO OF THE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND INCOMING SEE ISSUE STUDENTS ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND OF THEM ARRIVED UNDER PREPARE FOR THEIR FIRST COLLEGE LEVEL COURSE IN MATHEMATICS OR QUANTITATIVE REASONING THAT IS A PROBLEM IT DRAMATICALLY OUR- INFLUENCES THEIR CHURCH LIKELIHOOD. SO THE IDEA IS THAT NOT ONLY DO WE REFORM DEVELOPMENT OR REMEDIAL EDUCATION ON OUR END TO TRY OUR BEST TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE THE PROPOSAL WAS ALSO INTENDED TO IT INVITE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP UP TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BETTER PREPARE FOR COLLEGE. SUCCESS UPON ARRIVAL. SEE IS YOU EXECUTIVE ORDER. ELEVEN TEN ELIMINATED MATH PLACEMENT TEST AND TRADITIONAL REMEDIATION. IN FAVOR PLACE IN ALL STUDENTS AND COLLEGE LEVEL MATH. WHICH WORK WITH SUPPORT AS NEEDED. GIVEN THE POSITIVE RESULTS SO FAR WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT AN ADDITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL COURSE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SOLD SO LET ME JUST AGAIN OFFERIT WERE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT OUR OUR FACULTY AND CAMPUS LEADERS HAVE COMPLETED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN. AND IT HAS MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF HOW STUDENTS ARE PROGRESSING TOWARD THEIR DEGREE. HOWEVER IT WAS NEVER CONCEIVED TO BE A LONG TERM COUNTER BALANCE FOR THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ARRIVE INTO COLLEGE AND PREPARE. RIGHT SOUL THE IDEA IS THAT. SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I WOULD SAY EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE FULLY PREPARED AND THOSE WHO ARE NOW GOING TO CALL REQUISITE COURSES. THERE ARE STILL PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE STUDENTS THE IMPACTS ARE NOT AS HARSH FOR STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE UNDER PREPARED TODAY AS THEY WERE JUST A YEAR AGO BUT THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE STUDENTS WE WITH SOME OF US HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF GOING TO COMMENCEMENT CEREMONIES AND- AND WHEN YOU'RE THERE AND THE SCIENCE. SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING STANDS UP. THERE PRETTY CLEAR DESPAIR ISN'T AS OF WHO'S GRADUATING WITH STEM DEGREES AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS ON OUR OUR FUTURE WORK FORCE AND THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY OF MANY STUDENTS. SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT BUT BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE HALF OF THE EQUATION THE SECOND HALF IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENCOURAGE AND TO INVITE OUR STUDENTS TO BE BETTER PREPARED UPON ARRIVAL. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE WITH THREE YEARS OF MATH OR QUANTITATIVE REASONING COMPARE TO FOR IT'S PRETTY CLEAR. NOT ONLY STE WHY STUDENTS ASIAN STUDENTS AFRICAN AMERICAN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS ACROSS THE BOARD. THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION MATTERS. IF NEARLY EVERY STUDENT IS ALREADY MEDIAN THE REQUIREMENT AS STATED IN THE DOCUMENTS FOR C. ISSUES AUGUST HEARING HOW WOULD THE PROPOSED POLICY CHANGE AND IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY STUDENT MATTERS AND FOR THE REASONS YOU JUST HEARD DR MINOR DESCRIBING THE IMPACT NOT ON JUST ACADEMIC PREPARATION WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE CHANGES THE FIRST YEAR COURSES. BUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO STEM DISCIPLINES TO BUSINESS THE OTHER QUANTITATIVELY BASED COURSES NURSING ARE OFTEN CUT OFF BEFORE STUDENTS ARRIVE AND SO AS I YOUR SHARE WE BELIEVE THAT YES WALL WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT 91% OF OUR STUDENTS. ARE ACHIEVING THAT LEVEL THIS IS INTENDED TO MAKE SYSTEMIC CHANGE SO THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN CHOICE OF MAJOR AND CHOICE TO PURSUE A FIELD OF STUDY THAT BEST POSITION THEM FOR THE FUTURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT TO THE POINT THAT JAMES MADE. ACADEMIC PREPARATION MATTERS IN THIS WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP IN ADDRESSING. IF THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE STEM OUTCOMES. WHY DOES THE REQUIREMENT INCLUDE NON STEM QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES IS THERE CONCERN THAT INCLUDING THESE COURSES COULD ACTUALLY DECREASE THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS TAKING I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS NOW I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS YOU SEE THE INCLUSIVE RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES AS A DOES A COMEDY STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT CHOOSE TO PURSUE A STEM MAJOR BUT WAS STILL BENEFIT FROM QUANTITATIVE REASONING. PREPARATION AS I MENTIONED JUST PREVIOUSLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE WITH THREE YEARS COMPARED TO FOR ARE NOT ONLY THE PRESENT ACROSS EVERY ETHNIC GROUP OR ETHNICITY IT'S ALSO PRESENT ACROSS EVERY MAJOR SO EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT NON STEM MAJORS AND YOU TAKE THOSE WHO COME WITH THREE YEARS A QUANTITATIVE PREPARATION. COMPARED TO FOR THOSE WHO ARE TAKEN FOUR YEARS PERFORM BETTER WHEN THEY ARE IN COLLEGE SO WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THE BROAD RANGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO ARRIVE TO THE C. ISSUE THIS PROPOSAL STUDENTS WHO COMMON THEY'RE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WANT TO BE ESTá MAJOR MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE RIDE IN WITH THAT LEVEL OF PREPARATION. BUT A STUDENT WHO WE HAVE NOT ASKED TO DO THAT WHO MAY WANT TO BE ESTA MAJOR BUT CURRENTLY THE REQUIREMENTS ONLY REQUIRE THAT STUDENTS TAKE THREE YEARS OF MATH A QUANTITATIVE REASONING THAT STUDENTS. ARE ALMOST BY DEFAULT IS ELIMINATED FROM BEING A STAY MAJOR BEFORE THEY ARE ROLE IN THEIR FIRST COLLEGE COURSE SO THE IDEAL IS NATHAN IS MENTION IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY RAISE THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION FOR ALL STUDENTS SO THAT THEY HAVE REASONABLE CHOICES ABOUT THE MAJOR CHOICE THAT THEY WANT TO PURSUE STEM OR NOT STEM. THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS AN INCREASING I WOULD. ELIGIBILITY RATES ESPECIALLY AMONG LATINO STUDENTS. WHAT RESEARCH HAS CSU DONE TO EXCESS THE IMPACT THAT THIS CHANGE WOULD HAVE AN ELIGIBILITY. SO AS YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR YOUR SHEET HERE WE SHOWED SORT OF THE IMPACT OF OUTCOMES FOR INCOMING STUDENTS WE'VE ALSO APPLIED THAT TO OUR ANNUAL IN ROLLED NEW STUDENTS AND ADMITTED STUDENTS AND LOOKED AT SORT OF TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA BASED ON CD E. DATA. FOR THE FUTURE STUDENT POPULATIONS AND AS WAS MENTIONED DURING THE PRESENTATION WITH WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY CHANGE IN COMPOSITION ETHNICALLY RACIALLY OF STUDENT POPULATIONS BASED ON THIS CHANGE GIVEN WHAT WE SEE OCCURRING TODAY IS STUDENTS ARRIVING AND TO THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED THAT WERE DESCRIBED IN THE TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF BUILDING THAT ACT. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WHERE IT'S NEEDED. SO WHAT IS CSU STRATEGY FOR ENSURING. THAT THIS PROPOSAL IF IMPLEMENTED DOES NOT REVERSE THE TREND. LEADING AND LEADS TO DECLINE OF ELIGIBILITY AMONG LATINO AFRICAN MERICAN AND OTHER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. WHO CAN WE HOLD RESPONSIBLE IF THAT HAPPENS. AND HOW DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE HOLD CSU RESPONSIBLE SHOULD WE PROPOSED TO WITHHOLD FUNDS FROM CSU JUST LIKE YOU'RE PROPOSING TO WITHHOLD ADMISSION FROM A STUDENT WHO DOES NOT MEET THIS NEW HIGHER STANDARD. SO LET ME JUST SAY NO TO THE POLLS PROPOSAL OF WITHHOLDING FUNDS FROM THE C. ISSUE I. I WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION SERIOUSLY I A THERE'S NOTHING IN THE DATA ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED HISTORICALLY OR IN REAL TIME THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES OF STUDENTS OF COLOR. OR ELIGIBILITY FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE ADOPTED EVERY MARCH THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR GOALS TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND MAKES A PART OUR PRESENTATION. ON ACADEMIC PREPARATION WHICH PROFILES INCOMING STUDENTS AND THEIR TRANS AND HOW THE COMPOSITION OF INCOMING COURTS LOOK COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS AND I THINK WE WOULD HAVE AN ANNUAL WINDOW. IN TERMS OF HOW THE COMPOSITION BOTH IN TERMS OF GENDER ETHNICITY INCOME LEVELS AND LEVELS OF PREPARATION ARE CHANGING YEAR OVER YEAR AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BOARD THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR WITH OUTBOARD ACTION IN SOME CASES. ON TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IF FOR WHATEVER REASON WE SEE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE TRANS OF OUR INCOMING STUDENTS AGAIN THE C. ISSUE IS NEVER BANK MORE COMMITTED TO NOT ONLY ACCESS BUT ALSO EQUITY. AND MAINTAINING ITS RICH AND DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED NOR THE WE THINK THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PROPOSAL WILL HAVE NEGATIVE. EFFECTS ON THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INCOMING CLASS. IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THE LAST CHANGE DECEIT USE SEE ISSUES ADMISSIONS. WE KNOW THAT MANY HIGH SCHOOLS DO NOT REQUIRE THE EXISTING AG EIGHT THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS FOR MISSION. WHY IS THAT THE CASE AND HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD THIS PROPOSAL AFFECT THAT SITUATION. SALT LET ME JUST SAY WELL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THAT WE'VE HAD LOTS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL I HAVE MADE THE CASE THAT THE PROPOSAL. PERHAPS UNFAIRLY BEARS THE BURDEN OF MANY CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO SOLVE. EVERY PROBLEM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION WHO ARE ALL LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR THE PROPOSAL ASK SIMPLY AMONG C. ISSUE BOUND STUDENTS IS IT REASONABLE TO ASK THEM TO TAKE ONE ADDITIONAL COURSE IN QUANTITATIVE REASON AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PREPARATION FOR COLIC SUCCESS. STUDENTS TODAY WHO ARE NOT MEET IN THE EIGHT A. G. REQUIREMENTS FOR WHATEVER REASONS MANY OF THEM ARE HORRIFIC I'M HORRIFIED BY THE FACT THAT MANY STUDENTS CURRENTLY ARE NOT MEETING THE A TO G. REQUIREMENTS THERE IS STILL A PATH FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO THE CSU. HALF OF C. ISSUE STUDENTS TODAY ARRIVE FROM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOLD THE PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS NOT NECESSARILY INTENDED TO SOLVE THE DISPARITIES WE SEE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO ARRIVE TO THE C. ISSUE HAVE THE VERY BEST CHANCE OF BEING A SUCCESSFUL. ONCE THEY ARRIVE. I GOT A COUPLE MORE. SHE IS USE INDICATED THE TEN MILLION WILL BE USED THIS YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO PREPARE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS HOW MANY ADDITIONAL STEM TEACHERS HAS CSU COMMITTED TO PRODUCING PER YEAR AND HOW WILL THAT ADDRESS THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF TEACHERS. GIVEN THE EXISTING ATTRITION RATE AMONG MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE TESTIMONY IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL INVESTMENT OF TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHER INITIATIVE. ARCHCHANCELLOR IS COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. TWO MORE DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE TEACHER SHORTAGES A MATH AND SCIENCE. JUST LAST WEEK I WAS WITH THE CSU EDUCATION DEANS AND DIRECTORS OF EDUCATION AND WE SAT DOWN AROUND A TABLE AND TALKED ABOUT. HOW WE ARE COMMITTING TO THAT HOW WE'RE COMMITTING TO DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF MATH AND SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS THAT WE PREPARE WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND WE'RE. DEVELOPING AN IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENT TO IMPLEMENT WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. OVER THE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHER INITIATIVE SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND SO WE KNOW THE STRATEGIES WE ALSO KNOW WE NEED TO. INCREASE PRODUCTION TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS AND AS I WAS IT MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE IDENTIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE GOING TO START SO THAT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY OR SCHOOLS WHERE THE COURTS TAKING PATTERNS OF STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWING THEM OR ENCOURAGING THEM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MATH SCIENCE OR QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START OUR EFFORTS. LUCIUS WHO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PARTNERING WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS A COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO THE TO DO THIS WORK SO THAT'S WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. YOU MENTIONED THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING. SO MY QUESTION IS WHERE IS THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING COMING FROM AND FROM WHAT OTHER PURPOSES ARE THE FUNDS BEING SHIFTED TO SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE SO THAT TEN MILLION IS WAS PART OF A YOU MAY RECALL IN THE- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR STATE BUDGET. ON THE STATE ALLOCATED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO THE C. ISSUE THAT WAS TO BE SPREAD OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD IN THE- CSU. PROVIDED A PLAN BACK TO THE STATE OVER AND WHAT WOULD BE pDONE WITH THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE TAKEN FROM THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT ONE TIME ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING. AT CHALLENGE WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS THAT IT IS A WELL THAT THAT'S A ONE TIME. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO AN ONGOING COMMITMENT BUT OUR PROGRAM PROGRAMS LIKE TEACHER EDUCATION THAT ARE OFTEN COMPLETED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF POST SECONDARY WORK OR THAT CAN INCREASE CAPACITY. IN OUR INTEGRATED TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE A PERFECT USE OF AND ONE TIME IN ROMAN DOLLARS SO THEY COME FROM. THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ALLOCATION ONE ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH THIS THE ISSUE. SO WHAT IS THE ISSUE DOING NOW TO ENSURE THAT IS GRADUATES. GOING TO TEACH IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE. INCLUDING AREAS LIKE MY OWN INLAND EMPIRE. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE STUDENTS TYPICALLY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO QUALIFIED STEM TEACHERS AND STEM COURSES. AGAIN THIS WORK BUILDS UPON THE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHER INITIALLY BORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. AND WE ARE REDOUBLING OUR EFFORTS TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLY OF MATH SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. TO MEET THIS THESE AREAS OF SHORTAGE. SO I SEE THE ROLE THAT SHE IS YOU AND THE PRINT THIS PROPOSAL ENSURING MARK STEM TEACHERS A GRADUATING EACH YEAR AS A WIN WIN. KATE TWELVE WILL HAVE MORE QUALIFIED TEACHERS CS YOU WILL REAP THE BENEFITS WHEN THE STUDENTS TAUGHT BY THE GRADUATES COME TO THEIR CAMPUSES AS FRESHMEN. AND THE STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM STUDENTS AND GRADUATES HAVE A STRONGER STEM FOUNDATION. BUT WHY NOT JUST PURSUE CAPACITY BUILDING ON THE PART OF THE CSU PROPOSAL WITHOUT THE PUNITIVE ACCESS RESTRICTIONS THAT COME WITH INCREASING ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS WHY NOT JUST IT CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STEM TEACHERS. WITHOUT. IT'S TWO IN STATING VISA RESTRICTIONS THAT WILL. MAKE A DIFFERENCE MORE DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO IT GAIN ADMISSION INTO CS YES ALSO I WOULD JUST SAY QUICKLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT I THINK RATHER THAN EVEN EITHER OR WE PREFER BOTH AND A FEW WEEKS AGO THE C. ISSUE HOSTS A COUNSELOR CONFERENCE HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE PROPOSAL. AND MANY OF THEM AGREE WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT HERE'S WHAT STRUCK ME IN SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ALTHOUGH THERE COULD BE A COMMITMENT IN IS A COMMITMENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHAT WE REQUIRE AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS MATTERS THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS WHO SAID TO ME JAMES YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBER STUDENTS WERE LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL AT NOON.% BECAUSE THEY FOR FEEL THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEY'VE ALREADY MET THE CSU ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS AND BECAUSE WE DON'T ASK THEM TO DO ANYTHING MORE THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T. AND SO I THINK IT IT IS A POSSIBLE YES WE NEED TO INCREASED A TEACHER PRODUCTIVITY. ARE IN TEACHER CANDIDATES WHO WERE GOING INTO A HIGH NEED AREAS BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE REQUIRE WHAT WE BELIEVE STUDENTS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON ARRIVAL. AS I THINK YOU CAN DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU. THIS MCCARTY THANK YOU I THINK YOU NEEDED A BREAK MR MEDINA BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU CAN YOU CAN GO BACK BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. ANYBODY ELSE APPEARED TO ASK QUESTIONS. OKAY TAKE OVER YOUR PATIENT. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS YEAH YEAH I KNOW AND I THAT HELP FRAME SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE I JUST WANTED TO JUST TALK BIG PICTURE SAID IT WAS TWO YEARS YOU PUT THIS PROPOSAL OUT THEN I THINK I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT THIS SUMMER IT CERTAINLY WASN'T ANYTHING THAT. THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AT NEW ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT MAYBE OUR SPEAKER BEING THAT HE'S A MEMBER OF THE CSU TRUSTEES BUT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH HERE I WANT YOU TALK ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT I DIDN'T SEE AND I SEE A SHEET WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE CONCERNS I DON'T SEE SHEET OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING. BUT SHE DID THE FACULTY FOR THE CSU WHETHER IT'S THAT YOUR ACADEMIC SENATE'S OR THE THEY DID OR BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ORGANIZATION THE CFA HAVE. THEY ENGAGED IN THIS HAVE THEY TAKEN A POSITION. SO THE PROPOSAL IS A RESULT. OF A TASK FORCE REPORT THAT FOR MORE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE IN TWENTY THIRD THE TASK FORCE BEGIN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE REPORT CAME OUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WITH A MADE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF WHICH WAS. THIS ADDITIONAL OF REQUIREMENT RELATED TO QUANTITY I AGREE THAT MEANS AND IT DID YEAH YES OKAY AND NOW YOU'RE AT THE UNION AND THEY ARE NOT BASHFUL THEY THEY SHARE THEIR OPINIONS READILY. APPEAR AT THE STATE CAPITOL. WHERE ARE THEY WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY IS SO YEAH CFA HAVE YES THAT A LETTER OF OPPOSITION OKAY I DIDN'T SEE THEM ON THIS LIST HERE. THIS LIST ARE THE ON HERE. THEY ARE OKAY AND THIS THAT. ANYWAY OKAY THEN YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE DISTRICTS I SEE THERE'S A FEW DISTRICTS TO HAVE IT EXPRESSED CONCERN ONE THE DUPLICATES THAT SUPER TEN AND THE DISTRICT BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S FIVE DISTRICTS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE ALL OTHER STUDENTS DO THIS ALREADY ARE THOSE DISTRICTS HE I THINK HE SAID LONG BEACH STOCKED IN SAN DIEGO ARE THEY IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL SEC SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY FAR MORE THAN THAT FOR THE FIVE LARGEST ALREADY HAVE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS DIED SATISFIED THERE THESE REQUIREMENTS YEAH BOTH LONG BEACH UNIFIED IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED HAVE WRITTEN FORMAL LETTERS OF SUPPORT PART WE HAVE NOT ASKED ALL THE LARGEST AGAIN EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD. AGAIN ND GET BEEN ENGAGING THEM WE HAVE NOT MADE THAT ASK OF THEM YEAH SO THERE ARE MANY DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ALREADY DO THIS AND SUPPORT THIS POLICY YES YEAH HOW MANY OF THE THOUSANDS WHO SO SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO YOU THINK CURRENTLY HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT OF THE FOUR YEARS MAP SLASH Q. R. I DO NOT HAVE THE SPECIFIC ANSWER THAT SAID WE SORT OF STARTED WITH THE LARGEST AND THEN AS AS WAS REFERENCE CONDUCTOR CORNER SHIRES TESTIMONY AS WELL WE LOOKED AT THE SMALLEST THE SMALLEST AS WELL TO SORT OF LOOK AT BOTH ENDS BUT I DON'T HAVE A TOTAL COUNT. AT THIS MOMENT AND WE I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ON THIS CONVERSATION FOR SOME TIME THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE AN EXACT ARTICULATION OF THAT EITHER SO IT'S REALLY BEEN THROUGH THE EVALUATION THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. THE DISTRICTS WE HAVE THUS FAR. OKAY. AND THEN. THE WITH WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE- I KNOW THERE'S IT WILL GET TO THE SECONDS FAR AS THE- INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS. BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE. SIGN SACRAMENTO SAN BERNADINO SANTANA. ANAHEIM WHO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS POLICY YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO. SHOOT TO HIRE FACULTY TO TEACH THESE COURSES ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT IF I MAY. YOU KNOW I TOLD A GROUP LAST WEEK EVERYBODY LIKES CHANGE EXCEPT FOR THE CHANGE PART. A YEAR AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE ADVANCE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN. SIMILAR OPPOSITIONAL FORCES AROSE. THIS IS HARMFUL FOR STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR GONNA BE HARMED YOUR HE EVEN STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDER PREPARED INTO COLLEGE CLASSROOMS THEY'RE ALL GOING TO FAIL. EXETER ECCENTRIC CENTER RESOLUTIONS LETTERS OF OPPOSITION. A YEAR LATER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE TOOK THE FINDINGS ARE THE RESULTS FROM THAT POLICY CHANGE. AND DEMONSTRATED A STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO A DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COULD NOT GET THE UNDERSTANDABLE THE BUDGET QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAD SO WE DEAL WITH WHAT I'M WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO AS YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OPPOSITION. YEAH AND ABOUT WHO SORT OF POLITICALLY HAS ALIGNED WITH WHO NO NOT UPS AND SAYING WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS POLICY COMES INTO EFFECT THE AB I GET EIGHT YEARS TO. TO ROLLED IN WHICH IS A LONG TIME TO GET THAT LOSS THAT SAME QUESTION THE NEXT PANEL. THAT THERE IS A DESERT SO YOU KNOW WE LIKE THIS WE WANT TO DO IT BUT WE WERE WE KNOW WHERE. OUR CASTERS AND PURRS WERE BARELY UNDER BARELY AFLOAT ALMOST UNDER WATER AND ARE ARE DISTRICTS YOU OTHER STRAP WE HAVE ONE HERE IT'S NOT TO RUN OUT OF CASH AND LA IN OAKLAND AND THEY HAVE REAL CHALLENGES IN A BOOMING ECONOMY. WHAT'S THE NEXT RECESSION HITS AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE THESE TOUGH DECISIONS WHAT DO YOU DO THAT AND SO HOW DO YOU WILL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THESE DISTRICTS THAT NEED TO HIRE. ADDITIONAL STATS OR TRIGONOMETRYWHAT. WHAT HAVE YOU. GOT HOLD SOLD PROFESSING SO LET ME JUST. ANSWER MORE DIRECTLY I THINK YOU HEARD IN THE FIRST TESTIMONY THAT WHEN THESE CHANGES OCCUR. SCHOOLS DISTRICTS. AND SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES A JEST. THE SECOND THING I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT. YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT US TO OVER ESTIMATE WHAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. AGAIN VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS COURSES IN PLACE TO DAY. THAT WOULD MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. A NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT YOU HEARD NAY TH AND SAID AS A- BY PRODUCT OF GRADUATING THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE MET THIS REQUIREMENT. AND SO I JUST WANT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT THE LEFTY AS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO GO FROM FIFTEEN COURSES TO SIXTEEN COURSES OVER SIX OR SEVEN YEAR PERIOD YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF LIFE. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S INSURMOUNTABLE WHAT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. ARE TOUGH CHOICES AND BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE YES ADAM ALREADY HAVE THOSE COURSES AND THEY'RE NOT BEING. UTILIZED BY STUDENTS GOING WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT WE HAVE NOT REQUIRE STUDENTS TO TAKE. THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION REQUIRE FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON ENTRY OKAY. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE BUT MAY I MAY I MORE DIRECTLY OR IN A IN A PERHAPS. A DIFFERENT WAY ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MANNER ASSEMBLYMEMBER CART. WE COMMIT TO CONTINUING OUR COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS AND SO THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OUR E. R. W. C. COURSE. AND SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE AND WE HAVE AN MRI WC COURSE OF THIS IS A FOCUS ON MATHEMATICAL REASONING. THAT WE WILL USE THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF THE R. WC. WHICH IS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND OFFER THIS COURSE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE HIGH SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH THEM TO DEVELOP AND IDENTIFY EXISTING Q. R. COURSES THAT ARE IN THEIR COURSE SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW SO. SO THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IS TO PARTNER WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BUILD THIS CAPACITY OVERTIME GOTCHA. AND AS FAR AS THE EXEMPTIONS FOR THE STUDENTS THAT THAT WAS ONE OF MY- CONCERNS I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE POLICY YOU'RE SAYING THAT. IF YOU'RE A STUDENT. WHO AND YOUR AT A SCHOOL WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN OPTION FOR YOUR FOURTH YEAR. YOUR EXEMPTED BUT IT'S AN AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION OFF TO DO A SUPPLEMENTAL APPLICATIONS CORRECT SO IT DOESN'T GET ALL ON THE STOOD ON THE STUDENT OF THE FAMILY MEMBER THAT'S A KEY QUESTION NEXT PANEL AND WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS. AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION IN THERE AND THEN AS FAR AS IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING THE NORMALLY YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT YOU SEE WHAT HAVE THE HIGHER STANDARD SO WITH. CSU COMING BEFORE YOU SEE. AS SOMEWHAT ODD TO ME AND SO MEYER SETTING IS THE LAST TIME WE DID THE A THREE G. CHANGES THEY KIND OF CAME. AS A PACKAGE AND THIS ONE'S KIND OF A ONE OFF. AND YOU WOULD THINK. THAT THE UC ONE WOULD COME FIRST NOT THE CSU NOT KNOCKING THIS IS YOU OF COURSE I'M CSU GRADUATE THANK YOU. BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TOUCH ON THAT. SO LET ME JUST SAY QUICKLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND I DON'T WORK FOR THE UC SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE UC. BUT WHAT I NOW AND THEN. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME I'M NOT WELL WELL MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE LIBERTY HERE. BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE COMPOSITION AND THE PROFILE OF THEIR INCOME IS STUDENTS IS PROBABLY 99% OF THEM. ARRIVE WITH FOUR OR MORE YEARS OF MATH OF QUANTITATIVE NINE SIX YARDS A NOMINATION FOR THAT SECTOR. OKAY AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION SO YOU TALKED ABOUT WHICH I WAS INTERESTED THAT 91% OF YOUR STUDENTS A ROLE THAT CSU HAVE TAKEN FOR MORE COURSES RIGHT. NOT 91% OF INCOMING STUDENTS WOULD HAVE MET THIS REQUIRE YET ONCE YOU ADD AREA SEE AREA DE AN AREA SHE COURSES THAT'S KIND OF WHEN I MET BUT YES MUCH BETTER. SO OUT OF THIS OTHER STUDENTS. THAT THAT. IT DIDN'T ENTER CSU RIGHT NOW NEEDING REMEDIATION GRANTED I KNOW YOU'RE CHANGING NOW THERE'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE YOU'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE INTO ONE. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT THEY'RE DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T HAVE THESE COURSES ABSOLUTELY YEAH. ABSOLUTELY IT'S A STUDENTS WHO ARE BEHIND THE REASON THERE BE ASK IF THE MISTER ENOS QUESTION THE WRITTEN THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS YOU SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY. LET'S LET'S START START RIGHT HERE THIS IS THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE BEHIND WHEN THEY ENTER CSU NEED REMARK REMEDIATION. THEIR DISPROPORTIONATELY STUDENTS WHO HAD THREE OR FEWER OF THESE COURSES AND SO THEY JUST THERE. THEY START BEHIND THE STAY BEHIND ABSOLUTELY AND HOW HOW HOW CAN YOU. BE SO CONFIDENT CAN YOU WALK THROUGHS NUMBER WELL WHAT WE DO WE CAN LOOK AT THE PROFILE OF INCOMING STUDENTS AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE PROFILE OF STUDENTS AND PREVIOUS CALL COURTS WHO WERE REQUIRED. TO TAKE DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COURSES OR WOULD DEEMED UNDERPREPARED YEAH AND DISPROPORTIONATELY. THOSE STUDENTS ARE STUDENTS OF COLOR. THOSE STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND ALL STUDENTS HAVE LIMITED PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING A MATHEMATICS TO VERY CLEAR. AND ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT AT CSU YOU'RE MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN THE THAN THE UC SO IF THIS WAS A CHANGE THAT YOU SEE ADDING A. B. GREATER CONCERN BECAUSE- UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE IN CS AT UC ART ARE ALREADY HAVING A TOUGH TIME. MEETING THE NUMBERS ARE AT BUT THE PIPELINE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. IS VERY DIVERSE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THE NUMBERS FOR CSU. THE MAJORITY OF CS USE OUR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS YEAH BECAUSE 50% OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. REAP REFLECT THAT POPULATION. AFTER AMERICAN POPULATION I THINK IS PRETTY ON PAR WITH HIGH SCHOOL GRAD RATES AT CSU IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. SO IF THIS POLICY WENT INTO A FACT. WOULD YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN THAT THE DIVERSITY NUMBERS WOULD CHANGE OR THEY WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AS FAR AS YOUR INCOMING. CLASS I OR PRESIDENT TRANSFER STUDENTS I DON'T I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AND I THINK FOR CURRENT MIDDLE SCHOOLERS TODAY IF IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE BORE WAS TO ADOPT THIS POLICY THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR ONE ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE. WAS REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY FOR THE C. ISSUE THIS IS A REASONABLE ASKED TO STRENGTHEN THE PREPARATION OF INCOMING STUDENTS. THEN WE ASK ABOUT CAPACITY AND CAPACITY BUILDING OVER THE SEVEN YEAR PERIOD THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR ANALYSIS THIS SUGGESTS THAT THIS WOULD ALTER CURTAIL ACCESS FOR HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS THERE JUST ISN'T. THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THAT MANY MORE OF THEM BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE UC. BY WAY OF STRENGTHENED IN THEIR PREPARATION SO I'D I DON'T WANT US TO BE. I DON'T WANT US TO A TO EXAGGERATE THE PROPOSITION THAT SOMEHOW THIS BE A STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO RESPOND TO THIS AND THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES. AND AN ELIGIBILITY OR THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF OUR INCOMING CLASS YEAH. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY BEFORE IT'S THE NEXT. LOOKS LIKE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS ARE CHANGING THE THAT NEED FOR MORE STEM THE ECONOMIC CHANGES FOR WHAT BUT GRADUATES ARE SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS AS TWO WAYS YOU CAN BE LIKE. AS AS THEY ARE. SIR CONSULTANT OUTLINED EARLIER. IN THAT RATIONING OF ACCESS SO HE SAID THIS KIND OF THE WE TALKED ABOUT THERE IS THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASONS THEY ONLY HAVE TWENTY THREE CAMPUS AREAS WERE IMPACTED WE HAVE MORE MORE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING STUDENTS THE STATE'S BY GIVING IT UP ENOUGH MONEY TO FIND ON ROMAN SO YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME. THING AND THERE TO LIKE THROW A WET BLANKET ON THE EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE. BUT OF THE FLIP SIDE OF COURSE IS YEARS YOU'RE SAYING. THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE REALITY FOR WHAT STUDENTS NEED TO SUCCEED AT CSU AND NOT BEING REMEDIATION. AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BUT A COLLEGE GRADUATE NEEDS IN THIS IN THIS ECONOMY. SO. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ONE MORE TIME TO. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS AT THIS WOULD. LIMIT ACCESS FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN THIS BUSINESS I WOULD THINK TO AND THE CSU. TO LIMIT ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY YOU EXIST IN SO. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THE GOOD THAT HELD THE LESSONS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS AT ARKANSAS ALL BEGAN AND ALL ALL TURN MY COLLEAGUES TO ROUND OUT A RESPONSE. YOU WON'T WHEN WE EVEN THOUGH AS HAS BEEN CHAIRED THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ONGOING SENSE OF OUR ACADEMIC SENATE CREATED THEIR TASK FORCE ON THIS TOPIC IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH A REPORT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ALONG THAT SAME TIME AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKER THE STATE CONDUCTED AN ELIGIBILITY STUDY WHICH ULTIMATELY FOUND THE BASED ON THE GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. BUT THE C. ISSUES. CURRENT CRITERIA CAPTURING ABOUT 41% OF THE STUDENTS. AT THAT POINT OUR TRUSTEES OUR SYSTEM EXAMINE THAT DATA AND MADE A DECISION TO MAKE NO CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY IT THE CSU REINFORCED ITS COMMITMENT TO ACCESS THIS CONVERSATION WAS BORN OUT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND WHAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INSTITUTION AND ALSO TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FUTURE IN THE FACE OF SORT OF CHANGING WORKFORCE AND SOCIETAL NEEDS WHETHER THAT BE IN STEM DISCIPLINES WHETHER BEING JUST UNDERSTANDING BASIC INFORMATION SCIENCE BEING ABLE TO. UNDERSTAND POLITICAL POLLING AND DATA COMING OUT THEM ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS I'M IT REALLY BEGAN IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND THE NECESSARY ACADEMIC PREPARATION SO THERE WAS AN EASIER CHANGE TO MAKE IF IT REALLY WAS ABOUT CURTAILING ACCESS BASED ON THAT ELIGIBILITY STUDY FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT IT REALLY WAS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST PREPARATION NECESSARY TO ADDRESS EQUITY AND MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE COMPETITIVE. FOR CSU STUDENTS AND IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN. LASTLY WE. WHAT'S WHEN IS THE PROPOSED HEARING. AND THE VOTE FOR THIS AT THE CSU BOARD JUSTICE THIS WILL BE ON THE- BOARD AGENDA FOR THEIR NOVEMBER BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOVEMBER NINETEENTH AND TWENTY OKAY COMING UP. ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD MICHAEL. THANK YOU MISTER MEDIA THANK YOU. PERHAPS COMMENTS RATHER THAN QUESTIONS SINCE WE HAD THE DISCUSSION HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND WE SAW THE LEGISLATION BOTH FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CSU TO GET RID OF REMEDIAL CLASSES I VERY MUCH GET THE THRUST OF THAT HAVING BEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR HAVING BEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHRISTY. YOU KNOW I KNOW VERY WELL THAT BOTH AT THE CSU AND AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHEN STUDENTS WERE STOCK AND HAVING TO TAKE REMEDIATION IN A MATH AND ENGLISH AND I HAD MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY WOULD NEVER GET TO COLLEGE LEVEL MATH OR ENGLISH AND SO IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO. GET AN A DEGREE OR A FOUR YEAR DEGREE IF YOU'RE ALWAYS STUCK AND REMEDIATION I THINK THAT WAS THE THRUST OF BOTH THE LEGISLATION FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THE CSU AND THEN I SAW IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AT STANFORD AND DINO. A CSU CAL STATE SALMON A DINO WITH THE BRIDGE PROGRAM I'D BRING IN AND SOME STUDENTS OVER THE SUMMER TO DO VERY FAST BRINGING THEM UP TO SPEED BUT DURING THE SUMMER AND CONTINUING DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR. BUT THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO ME TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A REVERSE OF COURSE THE LA TIMES EDITORIAL SAYS YOU KNOW ITS- TAKING STUDENTS. LA TIMES EDITORIAL ON JULY TWENTY NINTH THEY SAY EIGHT REQUIRING ALL APPLICANTS AT CAL STATE TO TAKE A FOUR YEAR. SUBSTANTIALLY RAISE CAL STATE GRADUATION RATES OR PRINT PERHAPS NOT BUT IT THE FRIEND IN. WOULD ALSO MAKE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO APPLY TO CAL STATE ESPECIALLY BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS SO THIS SEEMS TO ME A REVERSAL OF STAKING STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND TRYING TO DO THE WORK. IT WHILE THEY ARE STUDENTS THERE. YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF DISTRICTS YOU MENTIONED MARTIN LUTHER KING HIGH SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT OF RIVERSIDE UNIFIED. AND AGAIN I'VE SPOKEN TO THE AS SUPERINTENDENT. OF RIVERSIDE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HE IS VERY STRONGLY A PROSE OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL. I STILL HAVE A MANY CONCERNS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE AS WE MOVE ALONG IN THIS HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND THEN WE WILL BRING UP. MICHELLE SEEK YELLOWS PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND CHRISTOPHER AT LEAGUE CO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT EMERITUS THE OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTE AND LAW PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. WELCOME. YEAH GOOD. BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK AYE MICHELLE SEE KATO'S PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY I'M ALSO THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND WAY BACK IN THAT DAY THEY WERE A THROUGHOUT FOR CHOIR MEN'S WHICH I ACTUALLY HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS EVEN IN ROLLED AND SO I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY STUDENTS THAT GOT TRAPPED SO THAT I COULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO TO. A COLLEGE AND EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THEN I GO TO UCLA AND GET MY MASTER'S DEGREE I THE CAMPAIGN WAS FOUNDED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO BY MAULED AFTER THE MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE AND FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN OUR STATE. THE CAMPAIGN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HAS USHERED SOME OF THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE HIGHER AT POLICY IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TEN WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THEN SENATOR ALEX PADILLA AND SPONSORED SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN FORTY WHICH CREATED THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. VERY MUCH STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR STUDENTS TO GET BETWEEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH GUARANTEED ADMISSION AS JUNIORS INTO THE CSU. I AM PLEASED TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE EARNED AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH THIS CHAMBER AND SPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN OH FIVE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN THAT REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO USE HIGH SCHOOL PLACEMENT TEST. THAT REQUIRES A COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO USE HIGH SCHOOL PERFORMANCE AND GPA NOT PLACEMENT TEST. IN ORDER TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY ENSURE THAT ALL TALENTED STUDENTS ARE PUT IN COLLEGE LEVEL CLASS COURSES THAT THEY WERE READY FOR EVEN THOUGH IT TASK MAY NOT HAVE PREDICTED THAT. BETWEEN OF THE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIS FALL THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER LOVER LEVEL COURSES IN MATH AND ENGLISH BEING OFFERED. BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. WE'VE WORKED WITH YOU VERY CLOSELY TO AN WITH CALIFORNIA GOVERNORS. TO SECURE OVER THREE BILLION IN THE STATE FUNDING FOR SIXTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SPOTS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN THE UC AND CSU. AND WE'VE PUBLISHED OVER SEVENTY GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH REPORTS INCLUDING LEFT OUT ACCESS DENIED THE STATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR LOT NEXEN BLACK STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE TRANSFER MAYES AND DIVIDED WE FAIL ALL THESE REPORTS FOCUSED ON PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE COLLEGE ACCESS. COMPLETION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO CLOSE THE STUBBORN RACIAL EQUITY GAPS THAT PERSIST IN OUR STATE. WE ARE RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON RACIAL EQUITY IN COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION AND HAVE BEEN NECESSARILY IMPATIENT WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND COMPLETION IN CALIFORNIA. FOR TODAY'S STUDENTS. I HAVE I HOPE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU SOME HANDOUTS THAT I WANTED TO QUICKLY GO THROUGH. ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUTS YOU CAN SEE WHY WE CARE ABOUT RACIAL EQUITY AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DIVERSE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADULTS IN OUR STATE ONLY 12% OF LAST NEXT ADULTS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THAT COMPARES 232% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT IN THAT GRAPH YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERYBODY TRAILS WHITE AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN OUR STATE AND THAT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO ALL OF US. OF COURSE THE CSU PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING CALIFORNIA HAS THE EDUCATED POPULACE THAT WE NEED AND THAT WE MEET WORKFORCE DEMAND. BY TWENTY THIRTY ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT 60% OF ADULTS WILL NEED TO HAVE SOME POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS NOT CONSTRAIN IT AND ESPECIALLY NEED TO INCREASE THAT FOR BLACK IN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS WE HAVE FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE CSU EVERY YEAR WITH THEM. DURING THE STATE BUDGET SEASON TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SPOTS AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN EFFORTS LIKE THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE WORKED AND SUPPORTED CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO STAVE OFF DECLARING IMPACTION. BUT THIS PROPOSED CHANGE TO ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THREATENS COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY BY MAKING CSU MORE SELECTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. AND THAT UNFOUNDED SELECTIVITY THREATENS OUR STATE. INSIDE THREE YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED AND WILL SPEAK TO TODAY OF THIS PROPOSAL. IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR RED FLAGS THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS. FIRST THE CSU CONTINUES TO RAISE THE BAR FOR ADMISSIONS HIGHER AND HIGHER SUCH THAT IT IS BECOMING OUT OF REACH FOR FAR TOO MANY STUDENTS PARTICULARLY BLACK LIGHT NEXT A NATIVE AMERICAN ONES. EVERY TIME OUR STUDENTS REACH THE NEW ADMISSION BAR THE CSU SETS. THE MOVE IT OUT FURTHER THAT IS WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DO. THE MOVING OF THE BAR IS DIRECTLY TIED TO MANAGING ENROLLMENT AND IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. INCREASING CAPACITY AND IMPROVING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN STUDENTS ARE AT THE CSU IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT NOT RAISING THE BAR ON THE STUDENTS THAT GET IN. SECOND THE CSU PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIALLY AN UNFUNDED MANDATE ON K. TWELVE. K. TWELVE DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OFFER THE CURRENT A THROUGH G. CURRICULUM EQUITABLY. LET ALONE A THROUGH G. PLUS ANOTHER QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE. IF THE CSU IS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THEY SHOULD BE WORKING TO FIRST ENSURE ALL STUDENTS CAN COMPLETE THE CURRENT A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS. BEFORE EXPANDING THEM AND EXACERBATING ACCESS CHALLENGES. THIRD THIS PROPOSAL BY CSU HAS BEEN DONE. IN A SILO IT HAS BEEN CLOSED OFF PROCESS FROM PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS K. TWELVE PARTNERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. IT THREATENS TO MISALIGNED COLLEGE READINESS REQUIREMENTS FROM THE UC AS ASSEMBLY MAN MCCARTY APTLY POINTED OUT EARLIER. FOURTH IF THIS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD DATA SHOWS ELIGIBILITY WILL GO DOWN FOR LET NEXT AND BLACK STUDENTS AS WELL AS STUDENTS IN KEY REGIONS OF THE STATE. WE CANNOT PUT A POLICY IN PLACE NOTING THAT IT WILL HAVE A DISPARITY IMPACT IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNACCEPTABLE. IN THE NEXT SLIDE. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ALREADY MEETING HIGH STANDARDS CHRISTOPHER COBALT ACTUALLY POINTED THIS OUT. BY TELLING YOU THAT THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAD IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OR NINETEEN SEVENTIES. ARE FAR LOWER THAN ANY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE OF TODAY STUDENTS IN FACT STUDENTS ENROLLING IN THE CSU TODAY ARE MORE PREPARED THAN EVER BEFORE. THEY DON'T JUST MEET THE MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY AT TWO POINT OH IN A THREE G. THEY FAR EXCEED IT. THE RESULT OF IMPACTION. HAS MEANT STUDENTS MUST MEET A MUCH HIGHER BAR FOR ADMISSION HERE YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL GPA ENROLLED STUDENTS AT FULLY IMPACTED CAMPUSES HAVE TO MEET. BUT LOOKING ACROSS ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES THE AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL GPA OF ENROLLING FRESHMAN IS NEAR A THREE POINT FIVE. FOR A STUDENT TODAY WHO EARNS THE MINIMUM TWO POINT OH IN A THROUGH G. THEY WOULD NEED AT THIRTEEN FIFTY S. A. T. TO MEET MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY AT THE CSU. AT THIRTEEN FIFTY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL TODAY CAN GET YOU INTO ALMOST ANY IVY LEAGUE IN THE COUNTRY. THE BAR HAS ALREADY BEEN RAISED AND STUDENTS ARE PROVING TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THEY'RE QUALIFIED. IN THE NEXT SLIDE. I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT A FEW MORE THINGS. 40% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND GRADUATES ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE CSU. AND THE STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES THAT'S THREE YEARS OF MATH TWO YEARS OF A LAB SCIENCE AND HALF A SEMESTER OF ECONOMICS. AND LET ME BE CLEAR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS IS JUST THE MINIMUM CSU ESTIMATES THAT INCOME INCOMING STUDENTS AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE A THREE G. COURSES WHEN SIXTEEN. ARE REQUIRED. SO STUDENTS ARE LIKELY STUDENTS ARE VERY LIKELY TAKING MUCH MORE QUANTITATIVE REASONING PRIOR TO CSU THAN JUST THE FIVE AND A HALF YEARS. THAT MEANS THAT DESPITE YEARS OF PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING CSU IS STILL DOING AN INSUFFICIENT JOB AT GRADUATING THE STUDENTS IF THEY'RE SAYING THE REASON FOR THIS IS TO IMPROVE THEIR GRADUATION RATES. CS USE OWN DATA SHOWS THAT ONLY TWENTY FOR WORK 24% OF STUDENTS WITH AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING. GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. AND ONLY SEVENTEEN AND 18% OF BLACK AND WHITE NEXT STUDENTS. WHO'VE TAKEN THE ADDITIONAL YEAR OF Q. R. GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. THE Q. R. PROPOSAL IS HARDLY THE SILVER BULLET FOR IMPROVED GRADUATION AT THE CSU. INSTEAD IT WILL BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF USING MATH AS A FILTER TO KEEP STUDENTS OUT. ON THE NEXT SLIDE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. TEACHERS AND QUALITY AND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S A CONCERN. THAT MANY OF US SHARE. SO INSIDE SIX YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ADDED INEQUITIES IN A THREE G. ACCESS ALREADY EXIST AT OUR SCHOOLS. ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNDER RESOURCE RACIALLY STRATIFIED AND OVERWHELMINGLY LOW INCOME. ARGUMENTS ABOUT A LACK OF CAPACITY QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND GREATER INVESTMENT TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF Q. R. EQUITABLY HAS FALLEN ON DEAF EARS AT THE CSU. STUDENTS HAILING FROM LOW INCOME AREAS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE UNQUALIFIED TEACHERS IN MATH AND SCIENCE THAN STUDENTS IN HIGHER INCOME AREAS. THERE'S PLENTY OF DATA ANDRESEARCH ON THAT COURSE AVAILABILITY AT A CAMPUS WHICH IS YOU KNOW AN ASSESSMENT THAT CSU HAS DONE ARGUING THAT THESE COURSES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AT MOST CAMPUSES. DOESN'T MEAN EVERY KID GETS A SEAT. IN FACT I'LL SHOW YOU A SLIDE ON A THREE G. COMPLETION BY RACE IN THE NEXT. HAND OUT YOU CAN SEE THAT MORE THAN 60% OF BLACK AND WHITE NEXT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE ALREADY IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE COW STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THAT IS TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT. THE NEXT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE A THROUGH G. COMPLETION BY REGION AND THAT VARIES TO WITH SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA HAVING THE HIGHEST BEST A THREE G. COMPLETION RATE FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN INLAND EMPIRE AND THE NORTH COAST HAVING SOME OF THE WORST. THIS IS WHY SEVERAL PROMINENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS EFFORT. YOU HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS OPPOSED INCLUDING LA UNIFIED ANAHEIM SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SACRAMENTO UNIFIED SANTA ANA UNIFIED. THEY REPRESENT ALMOST ALL K. TWELVE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THIS POLICY TO. IN THE NEXT SLIDE I WANT TO SHOW YOU A THROUGH G. COMPLETION BY INCOME. SO THAT WE CAN JUST BE CLEAR IN ON THE SAME PAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY. IF YOU'RE HIGHER INCOME STUDENT YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE THE A THREE G. WE HAVE YET TO SEE EVIDENCE FROM THE C. S. USED TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CLAIM THAT THIS PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD NOT HAVE DESPAIRED IMPACT ON STUDENTS SEEKING ACCESS TO THE CSU. NO ELIGIBILITY STUDY HAS BEEN DONE SO TOGETHER WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT JUST EQUATIONS AND AT TRUSTS WEST WE COMMISSIONED RTI INTERNATIONAL THE FIRM THAT COMPLETED THE STATE'S LAST ELIGIBILITY STUDY TO EXAMINE HOW INCREASING REQUIREMENTS WITH AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF MATHEMATICS OR SCIENCE WOULD IMPACT ELIGIBILITY RATES. USING DATA FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD HAVE REDUCED ELIGIBILITY FROM FORTY ONE TO THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. THIS CHANGE WOULD RENDER NEARLY 80% OF BLACK HIGH SCHOOL GRADS INELIGIBLE FOR THE CSU. IN THE NEXT SLIDE ON SLIDE ELEVEN. WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE EFFECT THAT ARE TI MODELED BY REGION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN GROWING REGIONS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY ELIGIBILITY RATES WOULD GO FROM 34% 227% TO BE CLEAR WE WOULD LOSE AS MANY AS ONE FIFTH OF OUR PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. INSIDE TWELVE YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT ON BLACK STUDENTS NEARLY A QUARTER OF BLACK STUDENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE WOULD NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE NEW CRITERIA. AN IN FLIGHT THIRTEEN YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT FOR LIGHT NEXT STUDENTS. THE NUMBER OF LACKEY LET NEXT STUDENTS WHO ARE CSU ELIGIBLE WOULD DROP BY ABOUT LET NEXT STUDENTS EVERY YEAR. PP I SEE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PIECE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CHANGING QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS EMPHASIZING THAT IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE MORE CONFUSION FOR STUDENTS AND SOME STUDENTS. WHO QUALIFY FOR THE UC MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR THE CSU. THE CSU CLAIMS THAT IF WE USE IF THE UC ADDS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR SCIENCE TO ITS ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS THERE WOULD BE OVERLAP FOR STUDENTS WHO WOULD WANT TO APPLY TO THE TWO SYSTEMS. BUT YOU SEE IS STILL CONDUCTING A RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT STUDY ON THE IMPACTS OF SUCH A CHANGE AND THE CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED AND MAY NOT EVEN OCCUR. SO HOW CAN WE MOVE FORWARD. YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A LIST OF OVER SEVENTY CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY LABOR AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL. THAT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA FACULTIES ASSOCIATION. MALL DEATH THE LA URBAN LEAGUE LA U. S. D. SAN FRANCISCO UST. THE STUDENT BODY PRESIDENTS OF CAL STATE LA. CALLE POMONA. CHANNEL ISLANDS AND DOMINGUEZ HILLS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY. THE ACLU OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE END DOUBLE DOUBLE ACP OF POMONA VALLEY ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE WE NEED THOSE U. S. MOSHE AND THE LOTUS WORK THAT FOUNDATION. AND JUST YESTERDAY. THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. THIS COALITION IS GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES I'VE JUST RAISED AND WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU TO EXERCISE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT. HERE'S WHAT WE ASK. URGE YOU. TO URGE THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE CSU TRUSTEES TO PAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTY AND LACK OF AUTHENTIC COLLABORATION FOR THIS TO MOVE FORWARD. SECOND THIS. SIGNIFICANT BACKLASH THIS PROPOSAL IS RECEIVING A SYMPTOMATIC OF A LARGER ISSUE FACING CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS THE LACK OF A COORDINATING ENTITY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WE PROUDLY SUPPORTED THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A COORDINATING AND TO TV AB ONE THIRTY WHICH WAS RECENTLY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR HOWEVER IT IS THIS TYPE OF ENTITY THAT IS BOTH INDEPENDENT OF THE SYSTEMS BUT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH EACH OTHER TO WORK TOGETHER WITH K. TWELVE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STATE THAT WE NEED TO REVIEW WHAT IS COLLEGE READINESS. IN RELATION TO OUR DEMANDS WHAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR THE STATE. WE URGE YOU TO APPOINT A TASK FORCE THAT CAN ASSESS COLLEGE READINESS ACROSS THE STATE AND CONDUCT AN IMPACT STUDY TO ASSESS THESE ELIGIBILITY. CHANGES ONE THAT IS INDEPENDENT AND TRANSPARENT FROM EACH OF THE SEGMENTS. WE. THE CSU MUST FOSTER GREATER K. TWELVE COLLABORATION. K. TWELVE COLLABORATION HAS BEEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT WITH K. TWELVE ONLY BEING BROUGHT IN WITHIN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS FOR PROPOSAL THAT HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SYSTEM THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND ONCE AGAIN IT RESPONSIBLE. THE CSU SHOULDN'T KICK THE CAN TO K. TWELVE TO IMPROVE THEIR GRADUATE GRADUATION RATES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL DO. FINALLY ANY CHANGES THAT EVENTUALLY OCCUR WITHIN ADMISSIONS MUST BE RIGOROUSLY MONITORED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO SET THE STANDARD BY WHICH CSU REPORTS ON ITS PROGRESS OF ANY ADMISSION CHANGES SUCH THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE TRANSPARENT AND REGULAR AND SUCH THAT WE INSURE THAT THERE ISN'T TO SPIRIT IMPACT. WE CONTINUE TO STAND WITH THE CSU THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CSU NEEDS MORE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO EXPAND CAPACITY THEY DO AND WE URGE YOU TO PROVIDE IT. WE ARE TURNING AWAY TOO MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AT A TIME WHEN OUR ECONOMY IS DEMANDING A MORE EDUCATED POPULACE. WE STAND WITH THE CSU AND ENSURING FUNDING FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND EFFORTS LIKE REMOVING THE REMEDIAL EDUCATION BARRIER POLICIES THAT LOOK AT HOW CS USE OWN INTERNAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE HINDERING STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE STAND FOR STUDENTS FIRST AND THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PUT THEM FIRST. I WANT TO JUST CLOSE BY SHARING A FEW THINGS IN RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS PANELIST AND REMARKS THIS IS ABOUT MANAGING ENROLLMENT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE AN OUTCOME OF A NEW ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS IT IS RATIONING AND SORTING THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. IT IS AS CSU DECLARES ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT IT FOCUSES ON THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND WHAT STUDENTS THE CS. I OFTEN SAY THAT IT WOULD BE A MUCH MORE HELPFUL CONVERSATION FOR COLLEGES TO STOP TALKING ABOUT STUDENTS BEING COLLEGE READY AND FOR THEM TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK THEMSELVES ARE THEY STUDENT READY. I URGE YOU TO JOIN CIVIL RIGHTS AND EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE TO EXPRESS YOUR STRONG CONCERN TO THIS PROPOSAL. I ALSO WANT TO ADD IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN TEN WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE CSU. BUT APPARENTLY MEMORIES ARE SHORT. THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. MUCH SUPPORTED THAT PROPOSAL IN FACT WE WERE CHAMPIONING IT WITH THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BY STUDENTS. IT WAS A GOOD POLICY FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. SO I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ON BRIDGE AT SAYING THAT FOLKS ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF CHANGE. NEITHER ARE OUR STUDENTS IN FACT THEY KEEP MEETING THE BAR EVERY TIME YOU RAISE IT. WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR CHANGE. EVERY YEAR FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO THAT GRADUATION AND ACCESS TO COLLEGE WOULD BE POSSIBLE SO THAT GETTING THAT DEGREE AND WALKING ACROSS THE STAGE WOULDN'T JUST BE AN ILLUSION. BUT THIS POLICY PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSED CHANGE DOES NOT MEET THE ONLY BAR THAT MATTERS IT IS NOT GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND IT IS NOT GOOD FOR EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA SO I HOPE YOU EXPRESS YOUR STRONG CONCERNS TO THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE BOB I HAVE ABOUT I THINK I HAVE FIVE POINTS TO MAKE AND I TRY TO DO IT QUICKLY SINCE I. YIELDED SOME OF MY TIME TO MICHELLE. I. I BUT I WANT TO START BY SAYING GIVING YOU A LITTLE BIT OF MY BIOGRAPHY SO. SIR YOU MAY FEEL THAT I'M WORTH LISTENING TO. I'M. I'VE ONLY BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN YEARS. I AM A PROFESSOR AND FORMER DEAN AT UC BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL BUT BEFORE THAT I TAUGHT AS A LAW PROFESSOR AT HARVARD FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. UP BOTH AT HARVARD AND IN MY NON DEAN YEARS AT BERKELEY UP MY PRINCIPAL AREAS OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING HAVE BEEN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND EDUCATION POLICY. I'VE ALSO WORKED ON EDUCATION POLICY IN THE I HAD JOBS TOUCHING OR INVOLVED IN EDUCATION POLICY. IN THE CARTER WHITE HOUSE WHEN I WAS TWELVE. I IN THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE. IN FIVE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND TO PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS. I. MY PERSPECTIVE IS LARGELY NATIONAL BUT I'VE LEARNED QUITE A BIT ABOUT CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. UP AND FINALLY UP MY FAVORITE HOBBY IS CHAIRING WERE PARTICIPATING IN COMMITTEES OF THE NATIONAL OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE. AND THREE RELEVANT COMMITTEES THAT I CHAIRED IN RECENT YEARS OP WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF LEADING. THREE THAT I HANDLED THAT ARE RELEVANT HERE AB. IS FIRST A PANEL ON SETTING ADULT LITERACY STANDARDS. WHAT'S. PROFICIENT WHAT'S ADEQUATE BUT CENTER SECOND A COMMITTEE ON SETTING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR NATE THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATION PROGRESS HOW SHOULD ONE DECIDE WHAT IS BASIC WHAT IS PROFICIENT. ARE AT CENTER. AND FINALLY I JUST FINISHED SHARING. A COMMITTEE THAT WAS CHARGED WITH DESIGNING A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF INDICATORS FOR EDUCATION EQUITY IN K. TWELVE. ALL RIGHT THAT'S ME. I. I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL WITH THE POLITICAL FORCES LINED UP BUT I THINK MICHELLE READ YOU A VERY IMPRESSIVE LIST OF WHO HAS WEIGHED IN ON IT I'D VENTURE TO SAY THAT ALMOST ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON HER LIST KNOW MORE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOLS. AND K. TWELVE CURRICULUM. THEN THE ACADEMIC SENATE OF CSU. SECOND. WHATEVER CSU DECIDES TO DO. IT IS A BUILDING ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND THE INEQUITIES THAT ARE ALREADY BAKED INTO THE EXISTING SYSTEM. MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR OUR PURPOSES THE CAPACITY ISSUES AND MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT CAPACITY TEACHERS. EFFECTIVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS. WE KNOW. THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE HIGHER MINORITY ENROLLMENTS HIGHER ENROLLMENTS OF POOR CHILDREN. ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HAVE TEACHER SHORTAGES IN STEM AND MATH. 80% OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS 80% OF SCHOOL DISTRICT CURRENTLY REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE TEACHER SHORTAGES. STEM AND SPECIAL ED ARE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES. THE EXISTENCE OF A COURSE IN A HIGH SCHOOL. DOES NOT MEAN THAT. EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT WILL BE ABLETO TAKE. AND THAT IS A CRITICAL POINT. I YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE COURSE CATALOG AND ASSUME THAT. IT MEANS GENUINE ACCESS ODD TO. FOUR YEARS OF MATH AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING. BOB NUMBER THREE. THE CORE CONCEPTUAL ISSUE HERE IS TO ME I WHO SHOULD BE MAKING THE POLICY ABOUT WHAT. THE ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. THIS IS NOT THE NINETEEN TWENTIES WHEN A THROUGH F. WAS ADOPTED BY STE BY CSU AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY. IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN NINETEEN SIXTIES SINCE THE MASTER PLAN. THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY A DIFFERENT SET OF GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS FOR K. TWELVE BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FINANCING STRUCTURE MORE STATE MONEY THAN THERE WAS BEFORE THE MASTER PLAN OPS MORE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR K. TWELVE THAN THERE USED TO BE. I AND MUCH MORE. SO I THINK THAT THE TRADITION OF HAVING THE FACULTIES OF CSU AND YOU SEE. STEER THE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM BOAT. IS OUTDATED. THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT X. EXPERTISE. AND IT SHOULD BE ABOUT LEGITIMACY. BUT THE DEEPER PROBLEM EVEN TO THAT. IS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE AS POLICY MAKERS THAT PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH PUBLIC. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I IT TOO TWO OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE SAID THAT CSU TAKES IT BELIEVES ITS RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE. WELL WHERE THEY ARE. IS NOT FOUR YEARS OF MATH A QUANTITATIVE REASONING. THE BATTLE NOW IS OVER WHETHER IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UNDER FUNDED HIGH SCHOOLS. BY THAT EXTRA PREPARATION. FOUR TWO FOUR TO REQUIRE THAT ARE COLLEGES ARE UNDER FUNDED COLLEGES. PROVIDE FOR THAT EXTRA PREPARATION. I ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT WHAT AN ACADEMIC SET ACADEMIC. SENATE SAYS ABOUT. REQUIREMENTS AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. IS RARELY IF EVER BASED ON EVIDENCE IT'S MOSTLY BASED AND I SAY THIS AS A LONG TIME ACADEMIC IT'S MOSTLY BASED ON FACULTY POLITICS. AND IT'S BASED ON. SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS. FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL VALIDITY CHECKS. GREEK AND LATIN. WORK IN PART. A SENSE OF COLLEGE PROFESSORS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE EDUCATED. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE ABOUT THEIR UTILITY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW IT WOULD PREDICT SUCCESS IN COLLEGE. SIMILARLY I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT TO PROMOTE COLLEGE SUCCESS. MORE MAPS. MORE MATH WHY NOT MORE WRITING. I. MORE WRITING WOULD BE MORE USEFUL IN THE REAL WORLD. THERE IS NO EXTERNAL VALIDITY STUDY BE OFFERED BY CS YOU AS TO WHY ADDITIONAL MATH AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING OUR REPORT. TO SAY THAT THEY ARE CORRELATED WITH HIGHER COMPLETION RATES AND HIGHER PERSISTENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IS TO ME RATHER FAIR NONSENSICAL. IT'S THERE IS NO THEORY THAT MAKES IT A CAUSAL CONNECTION IT'S ONLY A CORRELATION MOREOVER. IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST CORRELATION IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST PREDICTOR OF IMPROVED. POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. I AS COMPARED WITH FOR EXAMPLE GPA OR SCORES ON THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT. FOR IF I CAN BE IRONIC FAMILY INCOME. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH LOOKING AT EXPOSURE TO MATH WE KNOW THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY MATH IS CORRELATED WITH SOCIAL WITH WITH POVERTY AND WITH THE RACE. IF YOU PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF MATH PREPARATION. THEN YOU'RE PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON WHITENESS. AND HI INCOME. I THINK THAT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE. AND I DON'T THINK THE CSU FACULTY. IS THE SOURCE OF. DECISION MAKING ON. HOW MUCH INEQUITY IS TOO MUCH I THINK PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE. A WORD ABOUT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS. BOB. THE END OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION'S EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. A DISPARATE IMPACT OF A POLICY MAKES IT A CRIME OFFICIALLY CASE FOR VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION. I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE A DISPARATE RACIAL IMPACT FROM ADOPTING THIS AS THINGS CURRENTLY STAY AT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHO'S TAKING THESE COURSES WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS COURSE. IF THAT IS TRUE THEN WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER THERE IS WHAT STATE YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH. WE'LL HAVE TO ESTABLISH BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF THEY ADOPT THIS POLICY IT WILL VERY QUICKLY UP BE LITIGATED. BY CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEYS. CS YOU WILL HAVE THE BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT THEY HAVE A COMPELLING INTEREST. AT THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE POLICY THAT THEY COULD ADOPT. THAT. WOULD SERVE THAT INTEREST WITH LESS. DISPARATE IMPACT. BUT WE KNOW THE GPA AT THE RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT BOTH GPA AND THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT ARE VERY GOOD PREDICTORS OF POSTSECONDARY SUCCESS I SO FOCUSING ON. YEARS OF MATH. IS PROBLEMATIC FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAW. POLITICS IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT POLITICS SHOULD NOT PLAY A PART IN DECISIONS OF THIS SORT. OP FRANKLY AS SOMEONE WHO TEACHES AT THE INTERSECTION OF RULE OF LAW AND POLITICS. I FIND THAT A LITTLE NONSENSICAL. IF. POLITICS MEANS THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A VOICE. THEN YOU'RE SAYING. DEMOCRACY ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. FOR MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE POWER DYNAMICS IN EDUCATION POLICY. OR DECISIONS ABOUT EQUITY. THERE MUST BE POLITICS. BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE POLITICS OF AN ACADEMIC SENATE THAT'S DRIVING CHOICES OF SENSE OF THIS SORT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH IN AT A MINIMUM BUT YOU SHOULD WEIGH IN INFORMALLY. BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER. THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE THE EQUITY PERSPECTIVE. IS ABSOLUTELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ABSOLUTELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE STATE CONSTITUTION. MAKES THAT AN OBLIGATION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. DIRECTLY. FINALLY LET ME JUST SAY THAT I LOVE MATH. I THINK THAT MATH IS. THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD OR SOMETHING. I WAS THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN MATHEMATICS AND BRIEFLY CONSIDERED BEING A MATHEMATICIAN. IF I COULD MAKE THE CHOICE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE. TEN OR ELEVEN MATH COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL. JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. BUT IT'S NOT MY CHOICE I. BUT YOU SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE CHOICE. THE IDEA OF A WAIVER FOR AN EXEMPTION. FOR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS THAT DON'T. MAKE THE Q. R. COURSE READILY AVAILABLE. I. IS OKAY IF YOU FIRST DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS FOURTH YEAR IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE CS USE. OBJECTIVES OF IMPROVING IMPROVING ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. BUT EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST WAY. EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST WAY. THE EXEMPTION THAT CSU IS CONSIDERING. FIRST OF ALL HAS NOT BEEN DEFINED SO WE KNOW WHAT IT REALLY IS WHAT THE STANDARD WOULD BE. SECONDLY IT'S NOT IN THE FORMAL PROPOSAL. FOR WHAT WILL BE THE CHANGE IN THE REGULATIONS. IT'S MENTIONED IN STAFF MEMOS. AND THIRD IF THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EXEMPTION. IT SHOULD BE C. D. E. THAT DECIDES THAT MAKES THE JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT COURSE AVAILABILITY IN HIGH SCHOOLS. IS SATISFACTORY. LET ME STOP THERE I HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT DO I AND PERHAPS THE BE A CHANCE FOR ME TO. TALK ABOUT THOSE IN THE QUEUE IN A. THIS MCCARTY QUESTIONS COMMENTS THANK YOU. WELL FIRST THE SOUL MATH CHOICE I'M I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY BY THAT AND I WANT TO GET SIDETRACKED HERE BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE CSU SHEET HERE AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I ONLY WENT UP TO PRE ALGEBRA IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND YOU GOT NO WHERE AND I'M- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY BUT DON'T TELL ANYBODY BUT I RIGHT SHARE HALF OF THE BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA THAT EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT THE BUDGET BUT I'M REALLY GOOD AT DOING ON THE FLY MATHEMATICS WITH MY BASEBALL BATTING AVERAGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT IT DOES WORK OUT FOR SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT I WAS GETTING THAT THAT THIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW. THAT THAT WAS AN ALLY OF COURSE AND THE REALITY OF STUDENTS TODAY'S IS MUCH MUCH DIFFERENT BUT- THEY WOULD JUST ASK YOU JUST BIG QUESTION. BIG PICTURE QUESTION WHY DO YOU THINK. CSU IS PROPOSING THIS INTERVIEW. I ASSUME THAT YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE. AND THAT THERE HAVE ILL INTENTIONS OF HARMING. THE NEXT GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY- AND THEIR ACADEMIC SENATE. IN THIS POLICY. WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY A COMBINATION OF REASONS AND A COMBINATION OF MOTIVES AT AT WORK. I'M UP SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF A SENTIMENT THAT'S VERY FAMILIAR FOR ACADEMICS FOR FACULTY IS. I CAN I CAN HAVE MUCH BETTER STUDENT OUTCOMES IF YOU JUST GIVE ME BETTER STUDENTS CLEAR. SO. THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S DRIVING THEIR THEIR JUDGMENT. OUR AND IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY AS YOUR UNIVERSE TIRED OF DOING REMEDIATION AND DEVELOPMENT THAT'S RIGHT OR CREATING OTHER COURSES. NOT TO MENTION JUST THE QUESTION OF. WHO ACTUALLY SHOULD CARRY THE BURDEN OF DOING THESE THINGS WHICH EACH THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW THAT USED TO BE TAUGHT THE COLLEGE. BECAUSE WE MADE A JUDGMENT THAT WAS OKAY. FOR COLLEGES TO SHED THAT RESPONSIBILITY IF GIVEN THE HIGH SCHOOLS. THAT'S ALSO PART OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE MAKING CLEAR THAT THAT ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE TO QUANTITATIVE REASONING OR MATH. HAVE TO COME FROM HIGH SCHOOLS RATHER THAN FROM THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I KNOW WHERE IS IT WRITTEN IN STONE. WHAT THE ENTRY LEVEL CREDIT COURSE NEEDS TO BE. I'M. THE THIRD BIG THING ABOUT THEIR WHAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK IS THAT THEY'RE TAKING A SIMPLE CORRELATION. NGUYEN EXPOSURE TO MATH. AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. REALLY FOR PEOPLE MAJOR IN ENGLISH. FOR PEOPLE WHO MAJOR IN HISTORY. IF THERE IS A CORRELATION FACT SIMPLY PROVES. THAT MATH TAKING IS RELATED TO OTHER KINDS OF ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THOSE OF THE REAL THINGS THAT ARE DRIVING. THE SUCCESS RATES ASSOCIATED WITH MATH PREPARATION. YOU WITH ME AS I SAID BEFORE. MAP CORPORATION FIGHT BUT INCOME AND RACE AND GEOGRAPHY OUR FOR MORE FAR MORE POWERFUL DRIVERS. I'M. FULL STOP OKAY DID YOU EVER AS FOR THE CLASS OF FOLLOW UPS BUT YEAH I A YEAR I MEAN I AGREE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK IF THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND SPOTS IN THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I DOUBT WE WOULD BE HERE TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF YOU AROUND AN ADMISSIONS PROPOSAL THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO LEAVE STUDENTS OUT. BUT THAT ANSWER LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS THAT. BUT THAT WAS THE CASE YOU WOULD YOU COULD SAY THAT MAYBE THE STUDENTS WOULD ALSO HAVE CHALLENGES WITH REMEDIATION. AND STEPPING UP NOT BEING ILL PREPARED TO. TAKE THE COURSES ARE THERE IN FRESHMAN WHICH LEADS TO THREE OR FOUR. INCOMES THAT THREE OR FOUR FOR SIX YEARS AS FAR AS THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AND- YOU KNOW STUDENTS THERE'S THIS THERE'S A SEVERE CONSEQUENCE NOT TALK TO PRESENT ALSO ALSO TIME HE TELLS HIS INCOMING FRESHMEN THEIR FAMILIES. WHO WANTS A CHECK FOR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALMOST FAMILIES RAISE THEIR HAND OKAY WELL TO CHOICE IS EASY. YOU TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS A SEMESTER AND NOT TWELVE LIKE YOUR- FINANCIAL AID CAL GRANT ADVISER TELLS YOU DO. YOU WILL GETA CHECK FOR TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE CONVERSING OFF TO PAY THAT CHECK IN YOUR FAMILY YEAR WITH. TUITION HOUSING COSTS AND THAT'S A REALITY ITSELF STUDENTS WHO. AREN'T THERE MORE THAN LIKELY. GO ON NAFTA SPEND MORE TIME IN THE CSU SYSTEM. SO THE ISSUE THAT I ASK THE CSU EARLIER ABOUT THEY SAID THAT 91% OF THEIR STUDENTS. RT TAKE THE FOR THE FOUR YEARS. AND THAT IT'S THE IT'S THE- NOT NINE. NINE THE STUDENTS ARE ON CAMPUS. WITH THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ON CAMPUS STUDENTS WHO WERE ADMITTED TODAY RIGHT CORRECT BUT THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE POOL YEAH AND IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHO'S IN HIGH SCHOOL I GUESS TO GO BECAUSE YOU'RE ARGUING TWO THINGS YOU'RE YOU'RE I MEAN YOUR ARGUMENT IS NOT JUST WHO IS THERE BUT WE WANT TO GET MORE STUDENTS THERE. WHICH IS YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN WHICH I GET THAT BUT LET'S JUST FOCUS STUDENTS TO SHOW UP ON DAY ONE SO THEY'RE SAYING THAT THAT THERE'S NINE PERCENT. THAT HADN'T TAKEN THOSE FOUR YEARS OF MATH OR ADDITIONAL Q. R. COURSES THERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN ENROLLED IN REMEDIAL OR NEED REMEDIATION GRANTED THE REMEDIATION THINGS CHANGED. DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S NO CORRELATION THERE SAYING THAT THERE IS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE BEING PRESENTED AT THAT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TAKING MATH. AND BEING SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. IS CALL VOTE. THE THEORY WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT CAUSES THE IMPACT OF MATH TAKING IS THAT IN HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE THERE'S BOTH THE AVAILABILITY AND THE CULTURE I SUPPORTING MATH TAKING. I HAVE LOTS OF OTHER BENEFITS I'S GOING TO BE WELL OVER SOURCED IT'S GOING TO HAVE EFFECTIVE TEACHERS I IT'S GOING TO HAVE LESS. LESS POVERTY IT'S GOING TO HAVE LESS RACIAL ISOLATION. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE QUADRATIC EQUATION. I THAT IS. LINKED IT CAUSATION TERMS. OR THEORETICALLY. I TO POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. OKAY TO SEND YOU TO AN OBJECT RIGHT NOW YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT CAUSATION VERSUS CORRELATION AND BY GIVEN AT FAMILY. WHO'S HAS LIMITED RESOURCES A HUNDRED BUCKS LIKE TO MAKE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT FAMILY THAT KID LITERATE BECAUSE COULD HAVE HUNDRED BUCKS IS THE- PARENT IS GOING TO READ THE BOOKS AND ALL THESE OTHER. THINGS ARE IN FACT SO I GET YOUR- ARGUMENT THERE. IN YOUR ANALYSIS. MAYBE MY DID MAKE SENSE BUT- I THINK YOU DON'T I'M TRYING TO SAY. I DID OKAY. SO THE WHOLE OPTING OUT THING. WHY ONE THAT WORK IF THERE IF SEIZE YOU SAYING WE GET THE S. THE MAYBE SOME. DISTRICTS DONNA PICK ONE ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA JUST FOR WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T HAVE. THE COURSE OFFERINGS WE DON'T WANNA HARM THAT STUDENT THEY CAN OPT OUT AND THEY'RE SAYING THE ONLY AFTER ASKED OPT OUT AS AN AUTOMATIC OPT OUT. I WANT THAT SUFFICE THE OPPOSITION IN YOUR ARGUMENTS OF THIS WILL. DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT. A CERTAIN STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES UP BECAUSE THE CSU HAS FAILED TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT THIS WAIVER WOULD LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT. ANYTHING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN DETAILED STATUE AS THE PROPOSAL IS BEING FORWARD WERE SUPPOSED TO TRUST THAT THE WAIVER IS GOING TO WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY. DON'T DO A GREAT JOB AT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ACCESS COUNSELING PREPARATION SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE A THROUGH G. COURSES AS IS. CLARITY WOULD BE ALL VERY YOU KNOW VERY HELPFUL BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT A WAIVER. WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER IT THIS IS CAUSATION OR CORRELATION SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I GET THAT BUT THERE'S A WILL THERE WAS AN OPT OUT WHICH YOU THINK WAS. A FACT DEVON WHICH WOULD BE FAIR WOULD THAT MEAN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CONCERNS OF THIS POLICY. I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE POLICY FOR A LOT OF REASONS FIRST BECAUSE THERE ISN'T PROOF AS CHRIS AT LEE HAS ACTUALLY UPDATED. THE OPT OUT WITH THE OPT OUT IS NOT DEFINED I DON'T KNOW LESS AND LESS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAIVER. AND IT BEING AUTOMATIC SO THAT THEY HAD A CS ON BY NOW SHARED A LIKE IF THERE IF YOU COULD CRAFT THE PERFECT OPT OUT POLICY. WITH THAT MITIGATE THE MAJORITY OF THE- YOUR PROBABLY PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A RATIONING AND SORTING TOOL. AND SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN OPT OUT SO IN IT IMAGINE HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE THAT. THAT STUDENTS TO GET THE WAIVER AN OPT OUT AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPACTED BY THE POLICY WHEN THERE CONTINUES TO BE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE GROWING ELIGIBILITY. RIGHT BECAUSE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. AND THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THE RAISE THE BAR OF A THREE G. ACCESSING COMPLETION SO. SO NO I WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED. OKAY AND THEN WHAT. DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE REFER THEM TO PROVIDE YEAH. I APOLOGIZE FOR I'M- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESIGN. A WAIVER OR AN OPT OUT I'M. GOOD AT FINDING PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE EXPERT THAN I AM. AND I WOULDN'T LOOK TO SEE AS YOU FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE D. E. AND I'D LOOK TO INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS. SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE NO REAL CONTENT. TO WHAT THE CRITERION WILL BE FOR DECIDING THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T. HAVE CAPACITY HAVE THE MEASURE THAT OUT BUT. THE WRONG BODY THE WRONG PEOPLE ARE DEFINING THAT AND IMPLEMENTING IT. I SO AT A MINIMUM AT THE SHOULD BE SOMETHING IN WHICH I C. D. BABY THERE NEED TO BE. WARD STANDARDS SHOULD BE MAKING THE JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY OKAY AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT THE DISTRICTS ARE DOING THIS AND STAND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PANEL IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM MY LOCAL DISTRICT IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SUPER EXCITED TO SEE HER COME UP HERE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE'S GONNA COME IN ON THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING THIS AND SOME THAT ARE NOT SO THE CSU REPRESENTATIVE SAID ESSENTIALLY IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL WITH WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE IN THEIR RESOURCES KNOWING YOU HAVE. EIGHT YEARS. TO ROLL THIS OUT THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS TO. AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS LOCALLY STUDENTS WHO ARE IN TWELFTH GRADE. AND THEY'VE KEPT COULDN'T COMPLETED THEIR- COMPLETED THEIR OB. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE HALF DAYS. HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT THAT SOME OF THE LARGER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA LARGE POPULATIONS ARE ARE DOING IT AND IT HASN'T. UPSET THE APPLE CART TOO MUCH AT ALL OR DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE HARMS IN THOSE DISTRICTS FIRST FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS YEAH THANK YOU THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT A K. TWELVE EXPERT BUT I TRUST WHEN I TALKED TO SUPERINTENDENT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> CáC A LOT OF SACRAMENTO. I TRUST WHEN I TALKED TO SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND SCHOOL BOARD FORMER SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT MONICA GARCIA AND LA AND THEY TELL ME ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS AROUND THE AVAILABILITY OF MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE TOO MANY POSITIONS THAT THEY CAN'T FILL I'M CONCERNED WHEN THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE HEARD OF THIS PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT IT OR BECAUSE WE HAVE AS A COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAVE GONE OUT AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY GOOD COLLABORATION POLICY THAT LOOK AT RIGHT NOW IS TO NEXT BUT BUT RESPECTFULLY EARLIER THEY THEY MENTION THAT LEVEL. I THOUGHT THESE PAPERS WE MENTIONED NOT AS STRICT SAN DIEGO AND. LONG BEACH STOP IN THE MENTION A FEW OTHERS SO. IT'S WORKING THERE THOSE ARE LARGE DISTRICTS. AND YOU THINK WELL LONG BEACH UNIFIED INVESTED MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN AND OF ITSELF AND ITS IN RECRUITING PREPARING FOR A THREE G. AS A DEFAULT CURRICULUM. I WOULD LOVE IT IF EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD THE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY AND PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. THAT LONG BEACH WAS ABLE TO GET IN ORDER TO ELEVATE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR AND PROVIDE REAL ACCESS TO ALL STUDENTS. IF EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT DID NOT GETTING GO STOCKED IN ELK GROVE. SO HOW ANOTHER LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS. LOW AND I AND I CAN SHOW YOU A THREE G. COMPLETION RATES AND TERMS OF PREPARATION FOR ALL THOSE DISTRICTS I DIDN'T PULL THE OWES FIRST ON THE STANDING OUT HOW THEY'RE DOING IT. AND WHAT WOULD WORK WHEN. THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE ARTICULATING HAVEN'T BEEN HAVE MEANT VALENTYN THOSE. EXAMPLE WELL I THINK THEY'VE BEEN FOUND% IN IN SEVERAL DISTRICTS THAT I'VE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN TO OPPOSE THIS THAT ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SO SACRAMENTO. LOS ANGELES SANTA ANA ANAHEIM YEAH WELL LET LA UST HAS DEFAULT A THROUGH G. CURRICULUM. AND THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THAT FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND A 100% OF THEIR GRADUATES ARE STILL NOT ELIGIBLE SO I THINK ASSEMBLY MINUTES SPEAKS TO THE VERY REALITY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FACE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING TRUE EQUITABLE ACCESS EVEN WHEN THEY'RE COMMITTED TO IN A THROUGH G. DEFAULT POLICY. YEAH BUT I GET THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOUR JOB RESPECTFULLY IS TO GO AROUND IN. A CAMPAIGN TO RID ELEVATE THIS ISSUE TO ARTICULATED THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR CERTAIN POPULATION AND THERE ARE. A TO BRING BACK UP HERE WITH A LISTED QUITE A FEW DISTRICTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE POPULATION I WOULD THINK IT'S A- GREAT NUMBER OF THAT. OVERALL PUBLISHED IN CALIFORNIA THEY FIGURED IT AND WE MISSING SOMETHING. OR OR IS THIS FEAR LIKE YOU SAID THE CHANGE I MEAN HE SAID PEOPLE ARE AFRAID I LOOK ABOUT CHANGED THIS TO PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST IT. ARE A 100% CERTAIN THE DOWNFALL PEOPLE ARE FOR CHANGE ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THE UPSIDE SO WHY WHAT IS CHANGE ALWAYS LISTEN WELL FIRST IT STATE THAT THAT. THAT'S NOT MY POSITION. MY POSITION IS NO MORE BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION OKAY. SO THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE NO MORE BE SO THERE'S- I COULD GIVE YOU FIFTEEN. EMPIRICAL QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ANSWERED BEFORE POLICY WITH THESE HIGH STAKES RISKS. IS SET IN AND OUT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HOPE THE COMMITTEE. LET ME AS A MATTER OF I HAVE THAT I DON'T QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW MISTER MEDINA HAS SOME QUESTIONS WE HAVE ONE MORE PANEL THEN PUBLIC COMMENT. AND IT'S ALREADY GETTING LATE. AND SO MY QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS. A CAB. DO YOU THINK THIS POLICY. HAS HAS MERIT IT'S ABOUT TIMING. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE ROLLOUT LACK OF INFORMATION THE LACK OF K. TWELVE. ENGAGE MEN BUILT IN A SILO THAT'S ALL GOBBLEDYGOOK FOR YOU NOW JUST DO IT NEXT YEAR GIVE US TIME AND WE HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME UP HERE OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS SUCH A FATALLY FLAWED PROPOSAL ON THE IDEA. THAT WE SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AND THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET THAT BECAUSE KNOWING THAT. THERE'S OTHER DISTRICTS THAT HAVE DONE THIS AND THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE. HAVING CHALLENGES WITH REMEDIAL EDUCATION AND THE NEED IF THE SAYS AT. AT ELEMENT DECADE RECTIFY THAT I WISH WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION IN HEARING FROM THE CSU TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING INTERNALLY TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AND SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS AND THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK THAT'S HAPPENING AT CAMPUSES TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MUCH MORE OF OUR TIME AND ENERGY INSTEAD OF KICKING THE CAN TO K. TWELVE AND SAYING THEY SHOULD DELIVER BETTER STUDENTS BETTER STUDENTS BEING VERY SUBJECTIVE TO GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS POLICY. IS THE RIGHT POLICY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T PROVIDED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN A PUBLICLY TRANSPARENT WAY THAT IT ACTUALLY WILL CAUSE THE RESULT THAT THEY WANT THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE RESULT THAT THEY WANT WHICH IS IMPROVED GRADUATION RATES. WILL IT THE ONLY WAY OR THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS THROUGH THIS POLICY AND WITHOUT ANY PROOF THAT IT ISN'T GONNA HAVE DESPAIRED IMPACT FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FOR STUDENTS IN REGIONS THAT ARE ALREADY HAVING A VERY HARD TIME. MEETING COLLEGE PREPARATION EIGHT THREE G. ACCESS FOR OUR STUDENTS. I THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. CAPACITY PROBLEMS UP AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO POVERTY AND REYES I TO STATE THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THIS KIND OF POLICY THAT WOULD CREATE A DISPARATE IMPACT BUT WE DON'T WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT THERE BUT THERE IS RESEARCH RIGHT NOW THAT SUGGESTS THAT IT'S LIKELY. HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IT IT. I SO THAT REALLY DOES MEAN THAT THE BURDEN SHOULD BE ON CSU. EITHER DEMONSTRATE NOT WITH SPECULATION THAT IT WON'T. BUT ALSO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE. WAYS TO. INCREASED PREPARATION THAT DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF. RACIAL AND CLASS. ACT THAT MATHEMATICS DIES BECAUSE OF THE INEQUITIES THAT CURRENTLY EXISTING K. TWELVE. SO I KNOW THAT'S THOSE MY LAST QUESTION BUT YOU YOU'RE WATCHING THEM TO YOUR CONVEYANCE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS DESPERATE DISPARATE IMPACT. AND THAT'S A LEGAL TERM AN OBVIOUS YEAR AT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M NOT I YEAH I DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RIGHT RIGHT SO IF THE 91% WE SHOP THE CSU WITH FOR YEARS ALREADY ARE THE SAME ETHNIC BREAK GROUND AS A IMPACT. TO LOOK AT THE CSU INCOMING CLASS IT'S VERY VERY DIVERSE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ASSUMING THAT THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. HOW IT NEGATIVELY IMPACT IF THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING IN ARE JUST AS BROWN AND BLACK AS THE 9% TO GET IN AND WHO. HAVE DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE REMEDIATION AT THE GATE AND THEY NOW HAVE TO IN THE YOUNGER THE LITTLE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AFTER TAKE THESE FOURTH FOURTH. HERE OF COURSE IS NOT. BOB I THINK THAT IS EVIDENCE THAT. IT'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS NOT A DISPARATE IMPACT BUT I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG. ISSUE WITH THIS IS FOCUSED ON ELIGIBILITY. I THEY COULD USING WHOLE FILE REVIEW OF MAKE UP FOR US Q. IN THE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY POOL OF. BASED ON THE SUBTLER SUCH MORE SUBTLE HI. SCREENING AND. NOT TECHNIQUES THAT THEY USED TO BE MORE STOOD TO BE TO BE SELECT THAT'S THAT'S A HYPOTHESIS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW NO NUMBERS THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THAT IS WHAT IS PROBLEMATIC WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS. AND BEFORE THAT FOR MY PURPOSES A DESPERATE DESPERATE IMPACT. ABOUT WHAT THE OUTCOME WELL WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DISPARITY ALREADY IN CAPACITY. THAT'S RELATED TO POVERTY AND RACE WE KNOW THAT ALREADY THAT'S EVIDENT THAT'S RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE. SO THE MOST LOGICAL THING TO BELIEVE AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT UNDER RESOURCE DISTRICTS. I HAVE MORE TROUBLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION. AS A GENERAL IMPLEMENTING DOING THE RIGHT THING WITHOUT CFF IMPLEMENTING EL CAP I MEAN YOU NAME IT. UNDER RESOURCE DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY HAVE MORE TROUBLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION SO. SO WE KNOW THAT IF THE ELIGIBILITY POOL. PIGGY BACKS OFF OF A SET OF. IT SORT OF INEQUITABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE I THINK IT IS A VERY REASONABLE INFERENCE NOT SPECULATION I THAT. IT'LL BE TAINTED IN THE SAME WAY. AGAIN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELIGIBILITY YOU CAN CLEAN IT UP. TO A DEGREE WITH WHOLE FILE REVIEW. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I THINK I HEARD MISTER MCCARTY SAY THAT HE HAD THREE YEARS OF MATH. IN HIGH SCHOOL. SOUNDED LIKE ONE POINT ONE. THINK ABOUT WHAT ONE OF MY LEAST I'VE WON AT LEAST ONE AT LEAST ONE. MAYBE YOU MAY WANT TO MAYBE TWO MAYBE TWO MAYBE TO SOME OF THE FIVE PERCENTER. ONLY 5% PEOPLE HAD THAT. BACKGROUND SO I WAS THE CALL RIGHT THERE WITH YOU OKAY GOOD RIGHT TWO OF US. ALGEBRA ONE GEOMETRY. THAT WAS IT AS OUR FANCY CLASSES FOR ESTIMATES THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT AND STILL I WAS ACCEPTED INORDER DAME UNIVERSITY PURDUE UNIVERSITY AND I'M A GRADUATE OF UC RIVERSIDE AND HAVE A MASTERS IN HISTORY FROM UC RIVERSIDE. WITH ONLY THOSE TWO YEARS OF MATH. SO I THINK IT IS A POINT WELL TAKEN THAT THAT FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT GOING INTO. ENGINEERING SCIENCE YOU KNOW. AB THREE YEARS OF MATH MAY BE ENOUGH AND CERTAINLY MR MCCARTY AND I DID OKAY WITH ONLY. TWO YEARS OF MATH SO I'M JUST POINTING THAT OUT I ALSO WANT TO SHARE YOUR COUPLE LETTERS THAT I HAVE ONE IN FRONT OF ME HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS THE IT SAYS HERE IT'S SUBMIT THIS LETTER IN OPPOSITION TO CSU PROPOSAL TO INCREASE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. SECOND LETTER PATRICK O'DONNELL THE CHAIR OF EDUCATION HE SAYS I AM CONCERNED THAT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS CURRENTLY LACK THE FISCAL AND STAFF RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT. I DO THINK THAT IT IS A QUESTION OF INFORMATION AND DATA AND CSU. TO MY WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED. THAT THIS PROPOSAL. IS ONE NEEDED AND I THINK TO DOCTOR LEE IS AS YOU HAVE INDICATED. THAT THERE REALLY IS A CONNECTION ONE BIT BETWEEN THE OTHER AND THAT IT REALLY IS THAT FORTY YEAR OF MAP THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAD ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PROPOSAL WHAT WOULD THEY BE TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE. TO YOU IF ANY. WHY I THINK OUR OUR BROAD RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BE WE SHOULD BE HAVING A BROADER CONVERSATION AROUND COLLEGE AGILE ELIGIBILITY I THINK DATA TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN RAISED SEVERAL TIMES. INDEPENDENT DATA TRANSPARENCY TO REALLY ANALYZE A DESPAIRED IMPACT AND REAL COORDINATION WITH K. TWELVE TO INSURE THE POSSIBILITY THAT EVEN SIX YEARS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THE NEXT QUESTION AND I ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MORE DO YOU THINK THE pSTATE SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE ONLY TAKING TWO OR THREE YEARS OF MATH. AND IF NOT HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING TWO OR THREE YEARS OF MATH. OTHER THAN THE PROPOSAL THAT THERE. PROPOSING. IF THIS WERE GOING TO GO FORWARD. I THINK IT SHOULD BE CSU PERSUADING THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE SUPERINTENDENT. TO CHANGE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IF IT'S GOING TO BE DOT. IT STILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER. QUANTITATIVE REASONING IS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. THEY OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES. I AM NOT. MR BUT JUST LET ME LET LET LET ME LET ME STOP THERE. SO I WOULD. SO THE MAIN CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IN THE IN THE IN THE PROPOSAL AS IT'S WRITTEN AND IT MAY BE ON THE LEGISLATION COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS IS REQUIRE THAT THE- EXEMPTION. BE DEFINED AND IMPLEMENTED BY CD. RATHER THAN THE CSU ACADEMIC FACULTY. ACADEMICS AND. AND MY LAST QUESTION TO MICHELLE. IN NOT SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE THE CSU TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES. WELL I THINK OF YOU KNOW CS USE GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS BEEN A REALLY EXCELLENT NORTHSTAR IT HAS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT BY THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE AND THEIR LEADERSHIP AT THE VALUE OF IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES AND I THINK MOST OF YOU SAW THAT YOU KNOW WONDERFUL NEWS THAT THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE HAS INCREASED AS HAS THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VERY REAL REALITY AROUND COUNSELING AND GUIDANCE RIGHT ENSURING THAT STUDENTS KNOW THAT FULL TIME ENROLLMENT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IS FIFTEEN AND NOT TWELVE EVEN THOUGH YOU GET FULL FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING AT TWELVE UNITS. WE KNOW THAT SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAMS AT CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE WE KNOW THAT THE ELIMINATION OF REMEDIAL AT COURSES HAS HAD HUGE SUCCESS WITH STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED REMEDIAL WE ALSO KNOW THE CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO STEM ART COURSES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND GETTING THEM TO SUCCEED IN THOSE PATHWAYS. I THINK THE CSU PROBABLY IS A BETTER EXPERT AT A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT THEY ARE ALREADY PUTTING INTO PLACE I WOULD MY ADVICE TO THE CSU IS TO FOCUS AND DOUBLE DOWN ON ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES THE IDEA. THAT WE SHOULD. THE IDEA THAT THE BIGGEST SOLUTION SHOULD BE AROUND THE INCOMING STUDENTS. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON WHAT THE INSTITUTION CAN CONTROL AND SHOULD DO TO BETTER SERVE ITS STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO SEE GRADUATION NUMBERS GO UP BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF CONTINUING TO LEAVE MORE STUDENTS BEHIND AND LEAVE THEM OUT. ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE STUDENTS TYPICALLY TEND TO BE LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR. I'D LIKE TO ADD UP I'D I'D LIKE LIKE TO ADD MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT. THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO FRAME THIS. THE AT THE DEEP QUESTION IS UP WHAT CAN HIGH SCHOOLS DUE TO HELP CSU PRODUCE BETTER OUTCOMES. THIS PROPOSAL OFFERS ONE IDEA. ONE IDEA OF HIGH SCHOOLS MY COUNTRY MIGHT IT'S SPECULATIVE IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. BUT SUPPOSE YOU HAD A POLICY IN PLACE OF THIS Q. R. ONE THAT SAID. I STUDENTS HAVE TO HAVE. THE FOURTH YEAR OF MATH. FOR A SECOND A SECOND COURSE IN AYE EXPOSITORY WRITING. FOR A COURSE IN PHILOSOPHY. RIGHT MAKE MAKE A SET OF OPTIONS IF YOU BACK EACH OF THEM WITH EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE PREDICTORS OF COLLEGE SUCCESS I WOULDN'T LIMITED TO MATH BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MATH. RIGHT SO I THINK I THINK FRAMING IT THIS NARROWLY. EXACERBATES THE DANGER OF AMPLIFYING THAT K. TWELVE INEQUITIES WE ALREADY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND NEXT SIDE HOPE TO HAVE A RESPONSE FROM THE K. TWELVE AND WITH THAT I INVITE. JACKIE ONE. SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT WASHINGTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I THINK YOU BURDEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA THE FUN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY ADVOCATE TOLD RESPONSE PORTION OF THE OVERSIGHT HEARING HUGE RESPONSIBILITIES SO I ACTUALLY HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM CABLE THAT PERHAPS ARE MISSING FROM THIS PANEL. SO WITH THAT SAID MY NAME IS JACKIE TOO LONG LONG AND I CURRENTLY SET AT THE PRESIDENT OF THE WASHINGTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN WEST SACRAMENTO SO WE ARE THE END CAP TO THIS PANEL LOOKS LIKE. I WANT TO NOTE THAT I'M ALSO REPRESENTING NOT ONLY MY EXPENSE OF THE TRUSTEE BUT ALSO A DROP FROM MY EXPERIENCE HAVING WORKED IN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH INCLUDING BEING PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CURRENT STATUTORY K. TWELVE FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. OR ELSE YOU. MY WORK AT AND ALSO MY WORK AT THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT AS OF EDUCATION AS A REGULATOR FOR A STATE WIDE PROGRAM TALKING BELITTLE YOU. AT THE CENTRAL OFFICE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR IN A LARGE URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICT BEFORE AND DURING STATE RECEIVERSHIP SO YOU CAN GUESS WHERE THAT MIGHT BE. AS AN EDUCATOR IN THE HIGHER ED SYSTEM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AT THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. HELPING THEM TO FILL THEIR COLLEGE AND CAREER GOALS. I WANNA BEGIN BY PROVIDING THE COMMITTEE WITH A FEW DATA POINTS RELATED TO CAREFUL DEMOGRAPHICS I THINK IT WILL HELP PAINT A KIND OF. A PICTURE OF WHAT WHERE WEREUP AGAINST. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION STUDENTS APPROXIMATE TWO MILLION IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WITH A THIRTEEN HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL SEVEN OUR SCHOOLS OF ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION. AND A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT SPECIAL EDUCATION SCHOOLS. WHICH WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL. ONE QUESTION UNDER REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION. FOR MY COLLEAGUES IS HOW DO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN. A HIGH COLLEGE GOING CULTURES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING THAT ENTRY INTO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TITLE ONE ARE HIGH POVERTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE COLLEGE GOING FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN MADE AYE BUNDLING CLEAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. WHICH IS CALIFORNIANS NEW DISTRICT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AND I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT AFTER HIGHLIGHTS AND TRACKS PROGRESS MADE BY DISTRICTS TOWARDS COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. AND WE'VE USED THE A TO G. REQUIREMENT AS THAT TRACKING ADVICE AS WELL AS ENTRY COMPLETION OF COLLAGEN GRIP PATHWAYS. HEALTHY OF OUR STATURE DRIVER REQUIRES THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY WORK TOWARDS CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BETWEEN SUB GROUPS. AND TO ENSURE EQUITY FOR ALL THINGS WITHIN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM. NEW TO THIS ACCOUNT A FRAMEWORK AS IDENTIFICATION SINCE IN FOSTER CARE AT THE SUB GROUP A GROUP THAT I BELIEVE WILL MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CSU PROPOSAL. I ALSO AM CONCERNED THAT STUDENTS WITH SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHICS AS FOSTER YOUTH WILL SUFFER THE SAME CHALLENGES AS MENTIONED EARLIER. IT CONCERNS ME THAT THIS NEW PROPOSAL WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND POSSIBLY UNDERMINE CURRENT EFFORTS TOWARDS TOWARDS EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. WHICH AGAIN AS A DRIVER OF OUR STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO OUR SIX POINT TWO SIX SIX SIX ONE FOUR MILLION STUDENTS. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE UNPACKED IS WHETHER SOLELY IT ADDING A YEAR A QUANTITATIVE REASONING IS REALLY GOING TO ENSURE MATRICULATION A GRADUATION AND HIRING AD WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE. A WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED FALL STREET HOMELESS YOUTH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS AND OTHERS. IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE DATA. FROM AT THAT YOU CAN DATE OF STUDENTS IMPOSSIBLE TO OUTLINE THE WORK THE CABLE SYSTEMS HAVE TO DO TO ACTUALLY. MEET THE GOALS OF THE DASHBOARD AND THE INTENTIONS OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AGAIN OUR STATUTORY DRIVERS. THE HELP CLOSE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. ARE THE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY GAP. SO DO THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE TO STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE OFTEN AT AND ON AN ACADEMIC AND DISADVANTAGED. WHICH IS OFTEN EXACERBATED BY THE EXTREMELY HIGH SCHOOL MOBILITY OR TRANSFER RATES. THEY ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY AFTER TO TRANSFER SCHOOLS OF AN ACADEMIC YEAR COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS. ACROSS THE AND ACROSS THE BOARD THEY ARE STILL IN THE RED CATEGORY AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. MEANING THAT THEY ARE FAR FROM STANDARD IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH. FOR MATH SPECIFICALLY THEY ARE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POINTS BELOW STANDARD. SO AGAIN IT PAINS KIND OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO AN AN LVF POSSE THAT IDENTIFIED SUBGROUP. AND WE HAVE A STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO THEM. THEY ARE THE THEY ARE THE LOWEST BUT THEY HAVE THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE IN MEETING COLLEGE AND CAREER READY AS INDICATORS AT ONLY TEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY MEET THAT INDICATOR. ONLY BE TO BE BEAT BY. SAYS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AT NINE POINT 2% SO ALL ALL OTHER STUDENTS ARE AT FORTY TWO POINT 2% PREPARED. THAT MEANS THAT STUDENT FOSTER'S FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR NON FOSTER COMFORT TO MEET THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR COLLEGE. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A STRONGER LIKELIHOOD THAT FOSTER IT WAS RECEIVED A DEGREE IF THEY'D A DIRECTLY AND ROLL AND A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. RIGHT. ADDING THIS ADDITIONAL YEAR OF MATH AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS IN THESE SITUATIONS HAVE TO OVERCOME TO JUST MEET THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND HOW IT IMPACTS ACCESSIBILITY FOR STUDENTS TO WHOM THE STATE HAS THE UNIQUE OBLIGATION HAVING REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND FOR WHOM THE STATE HAS TAKEN ON PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THANKS AFFECT THE SUCCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION GRADUATION IS OFTEN DUE TO THE SUPPORTS PROVIDED VIA TARGETED STAMP PROGRAMS LIKE ETHIOPIA. E. O. APS GUARDIANS COLLARS AND THE LIKE. THIS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THESE TYPES OF TARGETED STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO PROSPER AND OTHER STUDENTS WITH SOME EXPENSE TO THRIVE IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMPLETE. DEGREES NOW THAT ASIDE THEY'RE ACTUALLY LARGER CONCERNS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO LIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT AND ALTHOUGH DISTRICT LIKE OURS. HAS TWENTY NINE COURSES WHO COULD MEET THIS OTHERS DO NOT. FROM. HOW DOES NOT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE IS OFTEN NOT REQUIRED TACTIC SHIFT RESOURCES EVEN OPEN THE LAID EMPLOYMENT IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. SPECIFICALLY WITH AN INEVITABLE RECESSION ON THE HORIZON AS INDICATED BY THE ECONOMIC INDICATOR SHARED BY THE LA JOH INVERTED YIELD SCORES LOW GDP. THE BUSINESS CYCLE ABOUT TO END RIGHT AND THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN SORRY. AS SOMEONE MCCARTY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHAIR THIS. HOW IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW AND WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISTRICTS WILL FIND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ADD ADDITIONAL COURSES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF SMALL WORLD OF STRENGTH WHO HAVE LIMITED TEACHING FACULTY TO MEET THE CURRENT CSU REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH WAIVER PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PUT FORTH FOR CONSIDERATION THIS WAIVER PROCESS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGES BOTH FOR K. TWELVE OUR ADVISORS AND I MATCH IN THE CSU SYSTEM IF IT ISN'T REALLY STREAMLINED AN% AUTOMATIC. IT SEEMS THAT THE WAIVER WOULD ALSO CREATE A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF ELIGIBILITY WHICH COULD. BE PROBLEMATIC. ALTHOUGH CSU HAS COMMITTED ONE TIME TEN MILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO HELP BOLSTER THE SHRINKING POPULATION OF K. TWELVE. STEM TEACHERS IT IS UNLIKE IT IS LIKELY NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THE GAP THAT IS REQUIRED TO MEET THE CURRENT CURRICULUM NEEDS. MUCH LESS TO BUY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING AND OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS AND SEVEN HUNDRED ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SCHOOLS. AS I DISCUSSED THIS WITH SEVERAL COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING SO THE SHOCK TO A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES BOARD MEMBERS SUPERINTENDENTS. THEY WERE. THE REASON FOR THE KEY QUANTITY REASON PROPOSAL IS UNCLEAR IF THERE IS A BELIEF THAT Q. R. IS WHAT CAN INCREASE MATRICULATION GRADUATION THEN WHY COULD VENN COULD QUANTITATIVE REASONING THE ONE OF THE OPTIONAL MATH OR SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS. ADOPTED IN WITHIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK. AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM COLLEAGUES WHO ARE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT HIGH SCHOOL MATH ACTUALLY NOT SEQUENTIAL WRITE SO DOESN'T GO FROM. ALGEBRA ALGEBRA TO GEOMETRY TO TRICK YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOLD IN A QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE AND SO IT'S NOT SEQUENTIAL AND THAT AND THAT METHOD. THAT THAT OPTION WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE RESOLVED IN ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH SEEM TO BE A BIT LIMITED IN SCOPE. ONLY FOCUSING ON MATH AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING WELL THEY COULD BE THERE COULD BE OTHER SEEN BEHAVIORS THAT MAY HAVE ALSO SHOWN HYBRID MATRICULATION GRADUATION RATES. I A PERHAPS COMPLETION OF ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES OR ANYTHING ELSE WITH THAT WAS MENTIONED BY DOCTOR LEE. OR FOR EXAMPLE OTHER RESEARCH THAT HAS IDENTIFIED STRONG SEEN SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND HIRED AT AS AS A- AS A WAY FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ACTUALLY COMPLETE AND SUCCEED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN CLOSING WHAT THIS PROPOSAL HAVE HIGHLIGHTS THE ME AND A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES AS A THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF STRONG COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CABLE SYSTEM AND SEE IF YOU TO INSURE THAT THERE IS A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT ARTICULATION. AND EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH FAR HIGHER AT. IT WOULD BENEFIT ALL PARTIES A STRONGER AUTHENTIC PARTNERSHIP. INCREASE CURRICULUM DESIGN AND UPLAND IMPLEMENTATION EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO. INDEED THERE ARE POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE SUCH AS LONG BEACH BUT WE ALSO MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LONG BEACH UNIFIED HAS HAD MANY FACTORS THAT HAVE CREATED LONGEVITY LEADERSHIP. WHICH INCLUDES STRONG PRIVATE FOUNDATION FUNDING EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH TO TREAT STRATEGIC PLANNING THAT WILL LIKELY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO ALL ONE THOUSAND PLUS HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW IN FISCAL RECEIVED RESOURCES AND A LOOMING RECESSION ON THE HORIZON. IS IT WISE TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE CABLE SYSTEM WHEN MANY DISTRICTS ARE STILL TRYING TO JUST MEET. THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND THE LOCAL CONTENT COAT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA MANDATES. AVAILABLE RESOURCES WOULD BE LIKELY BETTER SPENT ON HOW K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THAT. UBER IS ONLY ONE FACTOR THAT PREPARES K. TWELVE STUDENTS AT FOR SUCCESS IN THE CSU SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE BILL ISN'T JUST WANT WHAT QUESTIONS I KNOW YOU YEAH THANK TASK YEAR ONE DISTRICT AS A THOUSAND HAVE YOU SO THAT CSPA ASSOCIATION ARE THEY ENGAGED IN THIS ONE OR THE OTHER THERE OPPOSE THEY'VE COMMITTED A LOT ARE LOOK AT THIS AND I HAPPEN TO BE ALSO ONE OF THE CSPA. DELEGATES IF YOU ADD AOL AND. WHAT TO SOME OF THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT. WHAT ARE THEY HAVE A TEST A DISSENTING VOICE IN IT IN MATTER OF THE SUPPORT OF THE CSU POLICY I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF THE COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF FISCAL AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND- I THINK THAT THE LARGER ISSUE AT HAND IS. WHETHER NOT WE WERE ENGAGED FROM THE BEGINNING. RIGHT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT SIX YEARS IS THAT FOR YEARS AS A THREE YEARS IN TERMS OF. IS THIS IT DOES THIS MEET THEN TENTACLES OF CSU AND HOW WHAT IS THE ROLE K. TWELVE IN US. RIGHT SO THAT THE BIGGER QUESTION AMONG CALL A MONTH COLLEGE IS. HOW ARE WE ACTUALLY ENGAGING SCHOOL DISTRICT IN K. TWELVE. HELPFUL THANK YOU. EXTENT THEM AND THAT'S WHAT MY ONLY QUESTION SOMEWHAT AND IN THE SAME. SAME LINE ON THE TIME NEEDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION THE CONCERN. IT'S A IT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSION BETWEEN ALL ALL ACTUALLY AND EDUCATION CALL IT A CO AX CTA CSPA ETCETERA SO I WOULD SAY I RIGHT NOW I COULDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS A THOUSAND PLUS DISTRICTS WOULD SAY. AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT THERE YOU KNOW THE SMALL WORLD NEED TO BE EXEMPTED OR THERE'S ACTUALLY DIFFERENT MACHINATIONS I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SOME DISTRICTS CAN GO ONLINE SOONER LIKE WASHINGTON UNIFIED IN RIVER CITY OTHERS MAY NOT RIGHT AGAIN YOU KNOW HAVING SEEN THIS PAST YEAR A LOT OF THE PRESS AROUND CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. RIGHT AND HOW TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE BUDGET WITH IT ONE OF THE STARS AND PURRS COSTS AND OTHER THINGS AND HOW DO HOW WOULD. ONE ACTUALLY ADD AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING. WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY ASK. REPRESENTATIVES OF CSU IF THEY COULD COME BACK IF THERE. ANY AND SO WHAT ABOUT. AND IF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CS YOU COULD COME BACK TO THE TABLE PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS AGAIN THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND I HOPE THIS HEARING HAS BEEN BOTH INFORMATIVE AND I AM OPENING PRECIADO EVERYONE'S CANDOR AND TRANSPARENCY. IN THIS CONVERSATION. I PERSONALLY AM NOT CONVINCED OF THE SEA ISSUES OUR PROPOSAL IS WARRANTED I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE CSU TO WORK WITH ALL AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE THEY TAKE ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE STUDENTS OF SAID THAT THE STUDENTS THAT CSU BELIEVES THIS PROPOSAL WILL ASSIST ARE THE SAME STUDENTS WHO. VERY WELL MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL. WHO MAY NEVER MARCH MATRICULATED TO A CSU. WHAT WILL THAT A FAX AB ON THE STATE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE INFLUX OF STUDENTS WHO MAY CHOOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OVERSEE AS YOU. IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE LEARNED TODAY I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FOR CSU. AND LET IT MAYBE I CAN GO THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN ASK FOR A RESPONSE. IF THIS PROPOSAL PASSES I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE AS WAS RECOMMENDED HERE. THE CREATION OF A QUANTITATIVE REASONING IMPLEMENTATION TASK FORCE THAT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. SEE IS YOU REPRESENTATIVES. STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. RESEARCH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATION. THIS GROUP WOULD ONE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS IMPLEMENTATION AT SPECIFIC BENCHMARK POINTS TO RECOMMEND THAT RECOMMENDED THE TRUSTEES WHETHER THE ADMISSIONS CHANGES SHOULD TAKE A FACT AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX OR BE DELAYED IF NECESSARY. THREE OVERSEE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION CRITERIA AND ANNOUNCES IF. IMPLEMENTATION TAKES PLACE. SO MY QUESTION. WOULD CSU COMMIT TO THE CREATION OF SUCH A TASK FORCE SHOULD SUCH A PROPOSAL AS YOU ARE PROPOSING PASSED BE PASSED BY THE TRUSTEES. SALT SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER I THINK. IF IT DOES GO WITH HOUSE AND I CANNOT COMMIT ON BEHALF OF THE CHANCELLOR BUT WHAT I CAN SAY ARE HERE TODAY IS THAT I THINK YOU WOULD FIND A HIGH DEGREE OF COOPERATION AND WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION TASK FORCE. THAT GIVES ROOM FOR DIVERSE CONSTITUENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSIDER WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE IMPLEMENTATION POINTS OF EMPHASIS SHOULD BE AND THE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS PRECEDING UP THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE POLICY CHANGE IF IT IS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD SO WHILE I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THE CHANCELLOR I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES I THINK. THE CSU HAS REMAINED COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND I DID NOT MEAN FOR MY QUESTIONS TO IMPLY THAT I APPROVE AS SUCH A PROPOSAL. AND I AND I THINK IN A MINUTE SOON OPEN IT UP TO. PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I THINK JUST THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ORGANIZATIONS. YOU KNOW THE LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF HIGHER ED OF EDUCATION COMMITTEE MISTER O'DONNELL THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. I WOULD VERY MUCH CAUTION CSU TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU KNOW I IT I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH CONVERSATION WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS K. TWELVE. THEY'RE GONNA BE IMPACTED COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO I WOULD ASK CSU AND THE TRUSTEES TO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND TO. RETHINK THIS. BUT I THANK YOU AND I TAKE THAT AS A COMMITMENT. AND AM NOW GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. THANK YOU SOME OF THAT THANK YOU. SO ON PUBLIC COMMENTS WE WILL HAVE ONE ONE MINUTE PER SPEAKER. IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF BEFORE SPEAKING. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR MEDINA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MY NAME IS SUSAN GREEN AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT CAL STATE CHICO AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION OPPOSES THE EXPANSION OF THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS. IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE A THROUGH G. ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE THIS FOURTH YEAR OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING IF RUSHED WILL HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR STUDENT ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION PARTICULARLY FOR THE UNDERSERVED AND UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE. SEE IF A AGREES WITH THE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE. THAT SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS WHERE CHANGES AN ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY DIFFERENTIALLY HARMS STUDENTS WITH EITHER LESS ACCESS TO LOWER AWARENESS OF THESE MORE EXPENSIVE PREPARATORY ELEMENTS. AND THAT ANY SUCH POTENTIAL EFFECTS BE AMELIORATED AS THE ASSOCIATED POLICIES ARE DEVELOPED. PROPOSED REQUIREMENT WILL CREATE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO THE CSU AND EXACERBATE EDUCATIONAL DISPARITIES ALREADY EXISTING IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND WITHOUT DUE DILIGENCE AS YOU HEARD ABOUT FROM THE OTHER FOLKS HAVE TESTIFIED HERE TODAY WE WILL HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE EVEN MORE EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY. THE PROPOSED WAIVER FOR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT COMPLETE THIS REQUIREMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AS DR ED LEE JUST TESTIFIED A FEW MINUTES AGO IS AN INEFFECTIVE POLICY PATCH AND NOT A SOLUTION TO THE VERY REAL EQUITY IN ACCESS CONCERNS. RAISED BY THIS PROPOSAL. AS A PARENT. AND A FACULTY MEMBER AT CHICO STATE WHO HAS WORKED ON THESE ISSUES I WANT TO SHARE THIS AND THIS IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE WITH YOU. WE JUST ADOPTED COMMON CORE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TEN. AN OLD MATH CLASSES YOU WERE ASKED TO MEASURE THE AREA OF A TRAPEZOID. AND COMMON CORE YOU ARE ASKED TO SHARE THREE WAYS TO FIND THE AREA OF A TRAPEZOID. TO EXPLAIN WHICH WAY IS BEST AND WHY. THIS IS AN EXPONENTIALLY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING WE HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING COMMON CORE AND ITS IMPACT ON A COHORT OF STUDENTS THAT HAS COMPLETED THE ENTIRE K. TWELVE MATH CURRICULUM WE WILL NOT HAVE THEIR GROUP OF STUDENTS INITIAL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THAT'S THE EARLIEST POINT AT WHICH WE WOULD HAVE DATA SO THE CSU HAS DATA BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE RIGHT DATA. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SHOULD SLOW DOWN IT SHOULD CONSIDER ALL THE INTENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POLICY SHIFT AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH K. TWELVE DISTRICTS WITH CSU FACULTY PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO PREPARE THE MATH INSTRUCTORS TOGETHER DATA. ANALYZE THE DATA MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT DATA AND PERFORM MEANINGFUL AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS REGARDING. THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POLICY WE SHOULD ONLY IMPLEMENTED WHEN ALL OF THESE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED AND THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU'VE ALLUDED TO I HAVE BEEN DEDICATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND REMINDER THAT I AS FOR COMMENTS TO BE ONE MINUTE. UNTIL SHE WAS TALKING THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. WE WANT TO COMMENT ON OF THE UNIT THE INCLUSION OR EXCLUSION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS IN THIS PROPOSAL UP TO NOW THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SILENT ON THAT POINT AND AS YOU HEARD FROM A MISTER EVANS DISCUSSION IT HE ASSERTED THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF TRANSFER STUDENTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDING THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK TO HELP CLARIFY THIS POINT IT SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY STATED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF A PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THAT WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS PROPOSAL THE ABSENCE OF ANY STATEMENT IS CREATING UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION ALREADY OUT IN THE FIELD. AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY COMMITTEE COLLEGE COUNSELORS IN ADMINISTRATION SO I THINK SOME% STATEMENT TO CLARIFY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OF THE OF WHETHER THE SUPPLIES WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT AND SECOND TO THE POINT YOU'RE RAISING ABOUT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THE INVOLVED WITH THE COMMUNITY CALL SO REPRESENTATION THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AS YOU DELIBERATE ON THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MANY OF THE BIGGEST ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST HERE TO OPPOSE THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL EXACERBATE INEQUITIES CURRENTLY EXISTING FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. AS PROPOSED ETW HAS FOUR PRIMARY CONCERNS FIRST THERE HAS BEEN NO INDEPENDENT A RIGOROUS STUDY. ON THE FULL IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE. THE CSU MENTION THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO SHOWS NO DISPARATE IMPACT WE ASK THEM TO SHARE THAT DATA WITH AN INDEPENDENT. OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION TO DO THAT ANALYSIS AND SEE IF THAT HOLDS TRUE. SECOND CERTAIN KEY PILLARS OF THIS PROPOSAL HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY FLESHED OUT. AND CSU WE BELIEVE DOES NOT HAVE THE FULL DATA PICTURE. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THIS IS. EQUITABLY IMPLEMENTED. THIRD ARE CAPABLE SYSTEM CURRENTLY HAS AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO MATH SCIENCE AND CERTAIN A TO G. COURSES. FOR SPECIFIC STUDENTS CERTAIN REGIONS OF ANY SPECIFIC SCHOOLS. IN SEPTEMBER WE SUBMITTED A FOR A LETTER TO THE TRUSTEES WHICH CITED EIGHT OF THOSE STUDIES COMING FROM RELIABLE SOURCES SUCH AS PPRC THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SUPPORT CENTER PACE AND THE CHANCES OFFICE THEMSELVES. LASTLY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF MATH SCIENCE A QUANTITATIVE REASONING WELL AT FURTHER COMPLEXITIES TOWARD TEACHER SHORTAGE SPECIFICALLY IN THE STEM FIELDS A SYSTEMATIC CHANGE LIKE THIS SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF ENGAGEMENT WITH KATE WILL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE CABLE SYSTEM AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA SAID. AND IT HAS NOT THAT IS WHY SO MANY OF IN OUR POST AND ALL OF THEM ARE LISTED BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELL LEGISLATORS AND STUFF MY NAME IS ALYSSA LEE I'M A SACK STATE STUDENT AND THE VICE CHAIR OF. THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. SO CSSA AS OF YESTERDAY IS OFFICIALLY OPPOSED TO THIS FOR THE A QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL. FOR A FEW MAIN REASONS WE DON'T OPPOSE STUDENT SUCCESS. WE DO FEEL THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FAILS TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE Q. R. COURSE WORK. FOR INCOMING FRESHMEN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN STUDENT SUCCESS. AND IT WILL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME AND BLACK AND LATIN LIKE STUDENTS. AS WELL AS STUDENTS FROM RURAL REGIONS. SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW A FEW THINGS YOU GUYS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ITERATED I MEAN THIS YES USE MEANT TO BE MORE ACCESSIBLE. THIS IS POSING OTHER BARRIER. AND HOW DOES IT HELP NON STEM STUDENTS. AND THE WAIVER IS REDUNDANT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. THE C. S. USING KNOWLEDGE BEING THAT CERTAIN STUDENTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE AND IF THE CSU IS MEANT TO BE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MEANT TO INCLUDE ALL STUDENTS AS I BELIEVE MISTER EVANS HAD MENTIONED. WHERE WE KICKING THE 9% TO THE CURB. AND. DOCTOR MINOR HAD MENTIONED THE COMMENT YESTERDAY THAT HE DOES BELIEVE THAT HE HAS STUDENTS BEST INTERESTS IN MIND I DISAGREE WITH THAT IF HE'S REFERRING TO CSU STUDENTS THE CAL STATE SOON ASSOCIATION BE RECOGNIZED VOICE OF CSU STUDENTS IS A POST SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. JUST ONE BELIEVE THAT YOUR PRINCE THANK YOU. ALMOST GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR A LOWER EASTERLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE REGISTERED OUR OPPOSITION TO THE CSU TRUSTEES AND WE WERE THERE TO SPEAK IN PERSON AFTER OCTOBER MEETING. WE DON'T DO THAT THAT OFTEN RIGHT I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF MY TWENTY TWO YEARS WITH ETA THAT WE'VE COME TO THE CSU. AND SAID TO THEM OUR CONCERNS OVER STUDENT ACCESS. AN ON THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND SO WE SHARE WITH. THE PEOPLE LINED UP BEHIND HERE AND ALL THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU HEARD TODAY ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS AT ABOUT HOW STUDENTS. COULD BE DENIED ACCESS AND SO WE SHARE AND AGREE WITH THE CHAIR'S POSITION AT THE CSU SHOULD PUT A PAUSE ON THIS AND WORK WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDER OTHER EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EARLY EVENING CHAIR MEDINA ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY JAKE BREMNER WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL BE BRIEF AS MICHELLE HAS ALREADY OF MORE EFFECTIVELY AND ELOQUENTLY COMMUNICATED OUR CONCERNS THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO. BUT I DO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR YOUR CONVENING THIS CONVERSATION ON TO YOUR POINT SUCH A TIMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU BOTH HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN FIGHTING FOR GREATER ACCESS TO. OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BOTH CSU AND YOU SEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AT YOUR POINT IN REALLY SPENDING THAT PARK OF HISTORY TOWARDS GREATER INCLUSION. AND SUPPORT FOR ALL STUDENTS IN TRYING TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR WORDS OF CONCERN AND CAUTION TO THE CSU AS THEY TRY TO MOVE FORWARD AT THIS POINT ALL JUST UNDERSCORE TWO POINTS THAT BUT YOU BOTH REYES AND CAME UP IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY. FIRST THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITHIN A SILO CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES WOULD ESTABLISH THIS REQUIREMENT AND LEAVE IT TO THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM TO TRY TO INSTITUTE AND MAKE THAT A REALITY. WHEN AS YOU BOTH ARE AWARE IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIVELY FLUSH STATE BUDGET WE SEE REALLY THE FULL RANGE OF K. TWELVE STAKEHOLDERS EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS TODAY AND THE WRITTEN COMMENT. AND THEN FINALLY ON THAT SAME NOTE WE FOR RELATIVELY FLUSH STATE BUDGET BUT THERE ARE MORE WARNING SIGNALS THAT ARE A BLINKING RED ABOUT AN IMPENDING POTENTIAL RECESSION. AND HOW WILL DESPITE. FOUR YEARS OF POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION HOW WOULD THAT REALLY UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM TO DO THIS EFFECTIVELY. AND MAKE IT SO IT'S NOT A BARRIER TO STUDENT ACCESS THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING DAVID NEVIN ON BEHALF OF SANTA ANA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALL PRIOR SPEAKER SO AS NOT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH MORE TIME. ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO RAISE THAT HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET. AND SANTA ANA 52% OF OUR STUDENTS AT OUR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS. COMPLETE A RIGOROUS COLLEGE PREP CURRICULUM WHICH MEANS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE STILL RELYING ON. CREDIT RECOVERY OPTIONS AND GIVEN OUR ATG CURRICULUM. FOR DIPLOMA. TRACK THAT COULD BE. COME A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE GIVE IN THIS NEW PROPOSAL. WE THINK THAT IT'S A IT WILL ESSENTIALLY FOR ALL OF THE STUDENTS WILL CREATE. A TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF HIGHER ADD. AND PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGE IN THOSE SCHOOLS TO ONLY THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE INTERESTS AND THE SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY MATHEMATICS. ANYTHING THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE STEM AREAS. OUR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS DO YOU HAVE A GRADUATION PERCENTAGE RATE OF NINETY TWO PERCENT. AND AS WELL A COLLEGE GOING RATE OF SEVENTY SIX AND A HALF PERCENT WHICH IS FAR HIGHER ALMOST MORE THAN 10% HIGHER THAN. THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SO WE THINK THAT THE STUDENTS COULD BE HEAVILY OF MUCH MORE HEAVILY IMPACTED. BY THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS JENNA CARPENTER I MONDAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AND AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY THE POOR PRESIDENT FROM WASHINGTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THAT CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WERE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND WE REPRESENT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL LEADERS AND PRIMARILY FOCUS ON AND THE NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS AND THE PROPOSAL. IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OTHER STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND IT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THOSE STUDENTS AND LAST WEEK AT OUR LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY THAT ACCESO BOARD OF DIRECTORS TOOK A FORMAL VOTE AND IT WAS. IN OPPOSITION OUR OPPOSITION. LETTER IS FORTHCOMING THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS NOELLE MORA AND I REALLY GOT MORE OF A TESTIMONIAL I'D LIKE TO PUT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A STUDENT FACE ON THIS ISSUE TO SAY THAT I HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES OF GOING TO A CSU. QUITE A BIT AND HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN AN HONOR STUDENT BEEN ON DEAN'S HONOR ROLL ACTUALLY SERVED AS STUDENT PRESIDENT AT MY SCHOOL SUCKS THE LOS YOU'RE- NOT BEING SAID I RETOOK ALGEBRA TWO MICE MY LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. TO GET THAT PASSING GRADE SO THAT I WOULD BE ACCEPTED INTO THE CSU SO WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS ISSUE I REALLY WANTED TO COME HERE AND GIVE THAT QUICK STORY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY PERSONAL I COULD HAVE EASILY NOT. HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE CSU YOU KNOW GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL SO I DON'T I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT EVERY ONE IN THIS MET ENDEAVOR HAS WELL INTENTIONS BUT I. BEG TO POSE THE QUESTION IS THAT OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE UNDERPREPARED OR IS THAT THE INSTITUTION THAT IS UNDER PREPARED TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH THAT I THANK. EVERYONE FOR ATTENDING AND WE ARE DOING. AND EVERYTHING ELSE
