SOME PEOPLE WANT TO ONE BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET OTHERS AN ACCOLADE HOUSING AND MAKING APPROPRIATION OF FOUR TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER KING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB ONE ALL ONE IS OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TRAILER BILL. THIS BUILDS UPON THE SUCCESS OF LAST YEAR'S HOMELESSNESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE THEY PREVENTION PROGRAM. PROVIDES JURISDICTION CITY COUNTIES IN CONTINUES OF CARE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE MEDIA CHALLENGES AROUND HOMELESSNESS. IT ALSO PROVIDES A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTER DEVELOPMENTS. IT CREATES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING SUPPORT GRANTS PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR REGIONS IN JURISDICTIONS. TO CONDUCT PLAN THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE SIX CYCLE OF THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IT ALSO CREATES THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM OF TWENTY NINETEEN TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR ELIGIBLE CITIES. AND COUNTIES WITH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS IT ALSO INCLUDES FINES FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE NOT HOUSING. ELEMENT COMPLIANCE IT ALSO ALLOWS ALLOCATION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE NEW STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. ALSO PROPER IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE CAL HFA IS MIXED INCOME PROGRAM. AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE OH ONE THANK YOU MISTER KING MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE OH ONE THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY SEVERE AND PERVASIVE. DOWNED THE MEASURES OF THIS BILL WILL HELP A LITTLE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A PAUSE HERE. NOW TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND DO SOME INTROSPECTION ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE SOLUTIONS FOR IT. AND I THINK A HEALTHY PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WOULD BE TO ASK OURSELVES SOME QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN OTHER STATES ON THIS HOMELESS PROBLEM. WHY DO WE CONTINUE O HAVE THE HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY? IF WE CONTINUE TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN'T BUILD. A ONE UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE STATE AND WHY IS A COST US MORE THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE AND FINALLY. IF THIS S A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SOLVING FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS A CERTAINLY HAS BEEN. WHY DOES THIS PROBLEM CONTINUE TO GET WORSE? I'M SURE EVERYONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR POINT IN TIME COUNTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. HOMELESSNESS IS INCREASED. BY ALMOST 20% ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST YEAR. SO I THINK IT'S KNOWS SECRET TO THE PEOPLE THIS CHAMBER BUT THE PROBLEM HOMELESS NEXT IS COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED IT'S FAR BEYOND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HOUSES. IT HAS ITS ROOTS AND THINGS LIKE MENTAL ILLNESS. I IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I HAD IN THE DECLINING FORTUNES OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. BUT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO REQUIRE HOLISTIC APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS OF WHY PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS AND UNTIL. WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE STEPS. NEARLY THROWING MONEY AT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT. HOWEVER IF THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN DO OF THIS YEAR MY ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MEMBERS THAT ASK YOU TO GIVE YOUR RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO THE SPEAKERS. AND ASK FOR CALM IN THE BACK OF A CHAMBER PLEASE. MR CHOOSE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK OUR GOVERNOR AS WELL SO LEADERSHIP OF OUR LEGISLATURE. FOR COMING TOGETHER ON THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- WHICH IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY -- FROM THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTED IN THIS BILL TO THE POLICIES TO ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE. SET OF CARROTS AND STICKS TO MOVE JURISDICTIONS FOR THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BUT I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT AGREE -- WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU -- TO HOPEFULLY MOVING MOVE US FORWARD SO THAT WE HAVE A DAY WHERE THE NUMBERS THE TRAGEDIES -- THE SUFFERING THAT WERE SEEN NOW ON OUR STREETS ARE DRESSED BUT WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALL OF US -- TO REGISTER TO VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO SUPPORT AB. ONE OH ONE THIS BILL PROMOTES HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE THROUGH INCENTIVES FIRST BEFORE ALLOWING THE COURTS TO PURSUE ESCALATING PENALTIES. TO FORCE COMPLIANCE FOR ABOUT ACTORS. I'M ESPECIALLY HAPPY THE SMALL CITIES HAVE A SET ASIDE IN SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. BECAUSE RURAL AND SMALL COMMUNITIES FACE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN ATTRACTING AND DELIVERING HOUSING AND URBAN AREAS. THE BILL WILL GIVE LOCAL AGENCIES A CHANCE TO USE THIS FUNDING TO IMPROVE LOCAL PLANNING STREAMLINED LOCAL PROCESSES AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ACTUALLY DELIVERING HOUSING. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THE COURT TO CONSIDER MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHY A CITY OR COUNTY MAY BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. OUR TENDENCY IS TO LUMP LOCALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT AND DELIVER HOUSING WITH THOSE WHO INTENTIONALLY PUT BARRIERS UP. TO DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SEEKING MY INPUT ON THIS IMPORTANT HOUSING POLICY. AND THANKS TO THE SENATE LEADERSHIP THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- IN BOTH HOUSES IN MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL I ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. AS A MEMBER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO NOTE SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I THINK ARE OF SPECIALLY IMPORTERS. SIGNIFICAN HERE. WE ESTABLISHED POLICY HERE SET BY THE LEGISLATURE. THAT IS USED PROGRAMS GET IMPLEMENTED. FISH THERE SHALL BE CRITERIA THAT CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF RURAL SUBURBAN URBAN JURISDICTIONS. AND THE FACT THAT THESE JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER. SO WE THE LEGISLATURE TELL THE ADMINISTRATION THE HOUSING AGENCY. TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY TO A DOLLAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT'S ACTUALLY BASIC FAIRNESS. WE DIDN'T GO ON AND GRANTS TO THIS AGENCY. THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK THE HONOR DOLLARS HE'S DIFFERENCES BUT THEN THEY CREATE THE LIST OF WHICH ARE PRO HOUSING JURISDICTIONS. SO WE SAID NO ONE HAD LEGISLATURE HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH. BUT WE DIDN'T DO GRANT THE AUTHORITY THE AGE YOU JUST CREATE THAT LAST UPDATED PERIODICALLY. I JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S CITIES. THE FAIRNESS OF HOW THAT LIST GETS CREATED MAINTAINED THAT IT DOES REFLECT THIS LIFESAVING TEND TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL. IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER PUBLIC POLICY BEING ENTRUSTED TO THEIR CARE. AND WITH THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADDITION OF THIS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SMALL COUNTIES. WHICH WILL COVER TWENTY NINE OF THE STATE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IS ITSELF A A GOOD COMPANION PROVISION. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THERE AND DOLLARS HERE TO SUPPORT EVERY COUNTY TO BECOME COMPLIANT TO GET ON THAT PRO HOUSING LIST. TRY I THINK THAT THERE IS GOOD BALANCE WITHIN THIS LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE LENS OF SMALL CITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. BUT I DO SAY IS A LAWMAKER. WE ARE MAKING A BROAD DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY HERE AND I THINK WE'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS APTLY EXERCISE GOING FORWARD. URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER COLLEY MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I MEMBERS I WANT TO JOIN IN THE CHORUS OF SUPPORT FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR HOMELESS SERVICES AROUND THE STATE AND FOR HOUSING AROUND THE STATE. I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS IS ONE OF OUR A MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH ONE OF OUR MOST COMPLEX ISSUES AND AND ONE OF THOSE THAT IS MOST. DIFFICULT TO SOLVE AND YES THE COST OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS RISEN IT'S A CHALLENGE WE NEED TO FIND WAYS -- TO TRYIN LOWER THAT COST OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FOLKS WHO WHO NEED IT. BUT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE CURRENTCRISIS AND AS WE ASK. UP FOLKS AROUND THE STATE WHO ARE REPORTING THE RESULTS OF HOMELESS COUNCIL WE KNOW THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE RATE OF HOMELESSNESS IS UP 12%. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT NUMBER 16% -- THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT BUT THE NUMBER ONE DRIVER -- THAT WAS SET ASCERTAIN THROUGH THE HOMELESS COUNT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE HOUSING HAS BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THEM SO THE THEIR GOT THAT LAST RENT INCREASE. THAT OF THAT YOU KNOW THEY JUST COULDN'T MAKE AND THERE ON THE STREET. ARE THE COULD MAKE THE PAYMENT ON OR PERHAPS THEY LOST A JOB AND COULDN'T MAKE THEIR NEXT RENT PAYMENT BUT THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE STREET. IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE HOUSE MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE RISING TIDE OF HOMELESSNESS. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT THIS FUNDING WILL BE HELPFUL I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER TING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AGAIN JUST TO SUMMARIZE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID WITH A THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. ON OUR STREETS AT ALL TIME HIGH WE ARE ACTUALLY AT CRISIS LEVEL THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THAT WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT -- FUNDING INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL FOR AB ONE A ONE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.

AND SHE WENT INTO KNOWING ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. HAVING SEEN THAT FIRSTHAND -- BEING THE DAUGHTER. OF A DEPUTY SHERIFF. SHE WANTED TO IT WITH WIDE EYES AND BEING AT THAT MEMORIAL IN DAVIS WITH MY COLLEAGUE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME MOST WAS. THAT HER FATHER SAID GOD INDEED CALLED HER TO THIS. TO THIS PROFESSION AND EVEN CALLED HER TO THAT. ACCIDENT SITE THAT NIGHT -- THAT AMAZING FACE AND AND STRENGTH. THERE WAS SHOWN IN THAT FAMILY. OBVIOUSLY WAS EXEMPLIFIED IN THEIR DAUGHTER -- AND SO IT. WE HAVE REALLY HEAVY HEARTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVING LOST HER -- BUT WE KNOW THAT SHE'S IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE -- AND SHE IS LEFT A LEGACY.

SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED BY CINEMARK ANOTHER'S INOCULATED DRINKING WATER MAKING APPROPRIATION OF FOUR TO CLEAR THE YEARS HERE OF SIGNIFICANT MEDIALLY. MR GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES AFTER THREE YEARS OF RELENTLESS ADVOCACY AND COUNTLESS. COMMUNITY TOURS BUS TRIPS TO THE CAPITAL VOICES OF FAMILIES HERE VISITING EVERY SINGLE OFFICE TELLING US HOW IMPORTANT CLEAN WATER IS. FOR THE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT DON'T HAVE IT. WE HAVE A BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SENATE BILL. TWO HUNDRED IT REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE PLAN TO PROVIDE A LONG TERM FUNDING SOLUTION. FOR SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. I WANT TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR OUR LEADERSHIP HERE OF THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE SENATE FOR CRAFTING THIS SOLUTION AND HAVING THE COURAGE. TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS IN AN IMMEDIATE AND IMPACTFUL WAY. SPECIFICALLY SB TWO HUNDRED WILL ESTABLISH A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUN UNDER THE DIRECTION THE STATE WATER BOARD. I WILL TRANSFER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION A YEAR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND UNTIL THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY TO PAY FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER SOLUTIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE MEASURE REQUIRES A WATER BOARD TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DEVELOP AN ANNUAL EXPENDITURE PLAN ON HOW BEST TO ADMINISTER. AND DISTRIBUTE FUNDING IN RESPONSIBLE COST EFFECTIVE MANNERS. THAT PRIORITIZES SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY UNSAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IN DEVELOPING THE FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN THE WATER BOARD MUST CONSULT WITH AN ADVISORY GROUP MADE UP OF WATER SYSTEM REPRESENTATIVES. LOCAL AGENCIES AND RESIDENTS SERVE BY WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. ADDITIONALLY SB TWO HUNDRED SPECIFIES A NARROW ALLOWABLE USES OF THIS FUNDING TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE SPENT IN A TRANSPARENT. AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT ADDRESSES THE ROOT BARRIERS TO PROVIDING SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. MEMBERS THE FAMILIES -- THAT HAVE VISITED OUR OFFICE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT THIS ISSUE COME FROM ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. WE FINALLY HAVE A SOLUTION THAT WILL MOVE FORWARD IN BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BUT THE WORK WITH SB TWO HUNDRED ISN'T DONE. THE BE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT COMES AFTER SB TWO HUNDRED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY -- I IN TERMS OF WHERE THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. I WANT TO JUST AGAIN THE KNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA FROM PAY WORK AND OF COURSE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR SPEAKER FOR BRINGING THIS MAJOR FORWARD. AND THANK EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN PART OF THIS CONVERSATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I WILL. THANK YOU MISTER SAM MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. THE PURSUIT TO GET CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN OUR STATE HAS BEEN A LONG. ONE THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FIVE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED. AND WE'VE GONE AROUND AND HAD MANY MANY DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS ON WHAT WE ALL THINK THE RIGHT FUNDING FORMULA IS. BUT SB TWO HUNDRED ISN'T ABOUT THE FUNDING. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHTS. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM OUR AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING. THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS FAMILIES. HAVE CLEAN POSSIBLE DRINKING WATER. IT'S INSURING THAT OUR STATE. STICKS TO OUR WORD. AS WE DID IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MAKING CLEAN DRINKING WATER A RIGHT. IN THIS STATE. MEMBERS I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO SUPPORT SB. TWO HUNDRED ENSURE THAT OUR FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO HUNDRED IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THAT DO NOT HAVE SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER -- IN IN FACT MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE TO RELY ON PURCHASING WATER HAULING IT INTO THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THE WATER COMING OUT OF THEIR TAP IS ON SAFE. AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY GOING ON FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES UGH MR GARCIA -- SENATOR MINING -- EXCUSE ME THE THE MEMBER FROM THE FROM THE DESERT -- BUT I THIS IS AN ISSUE WHOSE TIME HAS FINALLY COME AND I HAVE -- TRIED IN A MY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR A CLEAN DRINKING WATER WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DO IT ON A ONE TIME BASIS. I AM IT'S TIME FOR THERE TO BE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING. BECAUSE WITH ONE TIME MONEY WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. WE DID HAVE MULTIPLE PLACES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE'VE LOOKED TO TO PROVIDE THIS FUNDING EACH ONE HAD ITS SUPPORTERS EACH ONE HAD ITS DETRACTORS WERE LANDING TODAY ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS. FUND -- IT'S AN OPTION FRANKLY NOT MY FIRST CHOICE. BUT IN MY OPINION GOING FORWARD. WE SHOULD BE USING THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND. IN WAYS THAT MORE FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THAT FUND AND I HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BE ABLE TO OUGHT TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. BUT FOR NOW THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE AN SP TWO HUNDRED OFFERS US A GREAT START ON RESTORING SAFE DRINKING WATER THE WANT TO THOSE. MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS IT LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR A LONG TERM EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. SB TWO HUNDRED CREATES. THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUNDED IT AUTHORIZES THE PURPOSES FOR THE USE OF THE FUND REQUIRES AN EXPENDITURE PLAN. BUT IT'S JUST A START. SB TWO HUNDRED PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION BUT NOT THE STRUCTURE AS THE FLOOR ANALYSIS NOTES IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND PRIORITIES FOR HOW THE STATE WATER BOARD WILL RESTORE SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND IN THE YEAR AHEAD. WE WILL STILL NEED TO SET THOSE PRIORITIES GIVE THE BOARD DIRECTION AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR HOW THE BOARD MOVES FORWARD TO OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. IN RECENT YEARS THE BOARD IS HIRED PRIVATE CONSULTANTS ARE NON PROFITS TO HELP INDIVIDUAL WATER SYSTEMS IN SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE IT IS HAD ACCESS TO WATER BOND FUNDS FOR FUNDS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS LIKE TREATMENT PLANTS IT IS HAD LIMITED FUNDING FOR SOFT COSTS. AND COULD ONLY DO SO MUCH SO NOW SB TWO HUNDRED IN THE STATE BUDGET. INJECTS A SUBSTANTIAL INFUSION OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH AND EVERY YEAR. THIS BILL CHANGES THE EQUATION AND WILL DEMAND THAT THE STATE BOARD SUBSTANTIALLY RAMP UP ITS EFFORTS TO GET SAFE DRINKING WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. HOW IS THE BOARD GOING TO SCALE UP WELL THE BILL DOES NOT GIVE THE BOARD NEW AUTHORITY OR DIRECTION ON HOW TO SCALE UP? AND I THINK ONE PART OF THE ANSWER IS ENGAGING ALL STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL WATER AGENCIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE. TO SET FAILING WATER SYSTEMS ON A NEW SUSTAINABLE PATH WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH. TO SAFE TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING SO NEXT YEAR AB ONE THIRTY FOUR WILL DO EXACTLY THAT AND ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. IN HOW THE BOARD CAN DO THAT SCALING SETTING PRIORITIES AND SETTING DIRECTION AND GIVING THE BOARD AUTHORITY THE AUTHORITY THAT IT NEEDS TO SUCCEED. SO THE CALIFORNIA CAN OVERCOME IT SAFE DRINKING WATER CHALLENGES. SB TO HUNDRED IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED [inaudible] THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO HUNDRED ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING WITHOUT SAFE WATER THAT THEY CAN DEPEND ON IN MANY CASES THIS IS BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION. IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT POLLUTERS MUST PAY. I AM PROUD OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS BUT IT IS MEANINGLESS IF IT IS ON THE BACKS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. LIVING IN RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES WITH CONTAMINATED WATER. THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE ESPECIALLY LARGE AND IMPORTANT% AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS MUST STEP UP. AND ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY. WE AS A STATE MUST ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. EVEN AS WE PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY WE MUST ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN TURN ON THEIR TAPS. AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE GLASSES OF WATER THEY GET FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. IT IS A WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO BE A PIONEER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. IN SUCH A PROSPEROUS STATE IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET CLEAN WATER. BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH. THIS IS HOW WE CAN PUT THAT EMBARRASSMENT BEHIND US. I ASKED FOR IT I VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO HUNDRED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.
