LARGE ALECTRA INVESTOR OWNED

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:13.470
UTILITY OUT WE ALSO REGULATE A

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:14.905
SMALLER MARKETERS FICTIONAL

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.072
UTILITIES BUT TODAY'S

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:18.942
PRESENTATION OF FOCUS ON A LARGE

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.143
I'VE USED. ALSO WHAT WE'RE

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:24.514
pTERM COST DRIVERS IN AND RATES.

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:28.084
AND AN OVERALL TRENDS AND- AND

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.687
CAUGHT. IN RECENT YEARS AND

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:33.156
LOOKING FORWARD. SOME OF THE

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.090
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:37.327
MITIGATE THOSE RATE AND BILL

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:40.230
IMPACT. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:44.034
OUR AFFORDABILITY PROCEEDING. TO

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.836
REVIEW ADDITIONAL BLUE SKY

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:48.138
PROPOSALS INCLUDING SOME-

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.239
ACTIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:53.643
LEGISLATIVE ACTION. TO FURTHER

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.348
MITIGATE RATE AND BILL IMPACT.

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:02.452
SO- FIFTH TWO THOUSAND AND

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.221
THIRTEEN WE'VE BEGUN TO SEE A

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:07.357
TREND THAT CAN OPERATE BEGINNING

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:10.994
TO INCREASE AT A RATE THAT

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.963
EXCEEDS THE RATE OF INFLATION.

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:16.399
AND A BIT SLIDESHOWS-

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:19.135
RESIDENTIAL RATE FOR THE THREE

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.438
LARGE UTILITY. AND WE CAN SEE

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:25.208
THAT THE- SOLID COLORED SHADED

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.544
AREA HERE WHICH IS SHOWING THE

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:29.513
HISTORICAL DATA FROM TWENTY

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:33.850
THIRTEEN- TO TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.285
THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR PG&amp;E

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:37.787
AND FOR US TO DOANY. REALLY

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:40.724
THE- INCREASE IN AND RESIDENTIAL

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.526
RATE HAS HAS GONE ABOVE THE

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:45.629
BLACK LINE WHICH IS THE RATE OF-

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:48.732
SPPI INDEX OF INFLATION.

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:51.635
ADDISON'S RATE- HAVE STAYED

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.803
UNDER THAT BLACK LINE UNTIL

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.938
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- BROKE THE

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.940
TREND AND CUT JOINED TOGETHER

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.942
UNTIL EIGHT. AND THEN WHAT WE

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:00.544
DID- THE STATE ACTUALLY THEY

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:04.114
COME FROM- A- SPECIAL STUDY THAT

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.950
WE DID AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.752
AND THE COMMISSION HELD IN ON

00:53:08.818 --> 00:53:12.088
BOND. WITH SISTER AGENCIES TO

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.823
BRING ATTENTION TO THAT ISSUE

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.725
WHICH WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.360
AND ARE AB FIFTY SEVEN RECORD

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.862
INTERESTED SIX NINETY FIVE

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.797
RECORD- SINCE WE FIRST STARTED

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.666
TAKING A TREND IN TWENTY

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:23.900
THIRTEEN. AND THEN THAT SPECIAL

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:26.069
STUDY WE DID A TEN YEAR A GREAT

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:27.971
PROJECTION WHICH NECESSARILY

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.639
REQUIRED A LOT OF MONEY I

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.174
FUNCTIONS AND WITH UNCERTAINTY.

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:32.609
BUT WHAT YOU SEE HERE IN THE

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.277
HASH MARKS AND IT'S CRAP THAT

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:38.081
THE RESULT. OF THAT OF THOSE

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:38.815
VERY PROJECTIONS. AND SO WHAT

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.817
WHAT WHAT WE- IS THAT BY TWENTY

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.052
THIRTY. BOND OLD PRESIDENTIAL

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:43.653
ELECTRIC RATES ARE FORECASTED TO

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.692
BE. APPROXIMATELY 40% HIGHER FOR

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:52.062
PG&amp;E 20% FOR ADDISON AND 70%

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.598
PERCENT DIEGO ARE THEN RATES

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:56.967
WOULD HAVE BEEN AT TWENTY

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:57.867
THIRTEEN RATES HAD JUST GROWN AT

00:53:57.934 --> 00:54:00.170
THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND WHAT

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.972
THAT MEANS- FOR OUR MONTHLY BILL

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.073
INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF TEN

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.909
YEARS IF THAT FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:06.876
AT THE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.878
INCREASE ADDISON ABOUT THE FAMED

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:11.014
AND FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:15.251
ELECTRIC ALMOST EIGHTY DOLLARS

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.386
TO. INCREASE NOW. SINCE THE

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.421
STUDY WITH DONE LAST YEAR USING

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.590
TWENTY TWENTY DAY THAT WE HAVE.

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.726
NEW DATA THAT SUGGESTS THAT SIX

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:23.927
PROJECTIONS MAY ACTUALLY BE

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.996
UNDER- AT THE MEETING FOR

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:28.164
EXAMPLE PGNIG RECENTLY MADE A

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.200
GENERAL RATE CASE FILING IN

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.736
WHICH THEY'RE PROJECTING AND 19%

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:36.406
THE ONLY PRE. SO THE THAT THE

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.508
MAIN CONTRACTOR THAT WE'RE

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:41.411
SEEING IN THE SHORT TERM IS DUE

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.380
TO INCREASE IN NATURAL GAS

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:47.017
PRICES. B- THE THREE LARGE

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:50.387
UTILITIES PUT CAUGHT INTO RATE

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:55.191
IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT AMOUNTED

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:58.128
TO ABOUT A 19% RATE INCREASE FOR

00:54:58.194 --> 00:55:02.866
PG&amp;E. IN A 100% RATE INCREASE

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:04.901
FOR AT A TEN AND 11% FOR SAN

DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. AND

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:10.907
ABOUT HALF OF- THAT THOSE THOSE

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:14.444
RATE INCREASES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:17.213
TO THE INCREASE AND- FUEL AND

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.449
PURCHASED POWER COSTS WHICH ARE

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:21.451

THAT'S WORKING ON PROJECT PART

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:29.526
COSTS ARE RECOVERED. AND NATURAL

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:32.295
GAS PRICES HAVE BEEN A FACTOR ON

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:34.464
ON POWER PRICES BECAUSE FEDERAL

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:39.035

A PRICE TRENDS THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:51.181

PRICE OF NATURAL GAS HAS GONE

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.987
OUT WHAT'S DRIVING IT IS THE

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.489
THIRD INCREASED GLOBAL DEMAND

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.391

ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL.

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.138

MILLION AT PARTY SPENT BUT WE DO

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.579
BELIEVE THAT- IT'S PROBABLY

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.681
IMPOSSIBLE OUR IMPACT ON ON

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:54.871
ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.540
RESOURCES TO. THE SUMMER ALECTRA

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.143

EXTREME HEAT WAVE DOESN'T

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.412
RESPOND TO THAT TWENTY TWENTY

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:04.714
EXTREME HEAT RATE THAT WE

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.416
THOUGHT AND ADVANCEMENT THAT

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.318
WE'VE BEEN MAKING SENSE AND- NOW

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.454
THERE'S BOUND BY THE HOPE THAT-

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.122
EVENTUALLY WITH THE INCREASE IN

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.457

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:16.225
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.128
THAT SALES WILL INCREASE TO A

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.063
POINT WHERE. IT BEGINS TO OFFSET

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.098
SOME OF THESE COSTS THAT WE'RE

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.400
SEEING. WE CAN THANK AT THE

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.968
MOMENT THAT WE'RE IN SOMEWHAT

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.004
PERHAPS THAT'S A VALLEY OF DEATH

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.739
WHERE WE SEE REALLY HIGH COST

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.308
BUT BUT LOS FAILED AND- AND WHAT

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.576
KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN THE WORST

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.645
OF BOTH WORLDS AND SO. THE HOPE

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.113
IS THAT ONCE WE GET KIND OF TRUE

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.515
THAT- AND WE INCREASE FAILED TO

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.416
ELECTRIFICATION THAT WILL BEGIN

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:45.888
TO- SOFTEN. THE BLOW ON RIGHT.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.523
WHAT IS YOUR MAIN. BY WHICH WE-

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.760
MITIGATE AND- IN IT ON RATE AND

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:53.362
BILL THAT. THE FIRST IS TO

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.664
REDUCE COSTS AND VOTE THAT

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.933
THAT'S BASICALLY THE MOST DIRECT

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.635
WAY- IMPAIR AND IMPACTING

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:02.171
THAT'S- ABOUT THE LARGER- IMPACT

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.307
ON RATES AND BILLS. RELATIVE TO

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.675
THE OTHER STRATEGY WHICH IS TO

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.610
CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE ALLOCATE

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.345
THOSE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:13.583
ALLOCATING. MORE COST. TO

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.419
CUSTOMERS THAT CAN CONSUME MORE.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.388
ELECTRICITY RATHER THAN LAST OR-

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.524
ALLOCATE COSTS PERHAPS YOU-

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.260
THOSE WHO CAN- ARE IN HIGHER

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.095
INCOME BRACKETS OR WHAT HAVE YOU

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.497
SO. THOSE THOSE THOSE COST

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:29.932
ALLOCATION METHODS THAT HAVE A

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.500
MORE INDIRECT IMPACT AND THEY

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.102
HAVE A MUCH SMALLER- GREAT

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.004
IMPACT AND BILL IMPACT AND COST

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.339
REDUCTION STRATEGY BECAUSE THE

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:41.711
SAME AMOUNT OF. COST. NEED TO BE

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.045
RECOVERED OVERALL. THE WHAT THE

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:45.414
PEACE BEEN DOWN- TO TRY ADDRESS

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:48.651
THAT WORRISOME. BOB SECURITY-

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:49.819
ADORED GRANTED BY THE

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.520
LEGISLATURE IS ONE WAY OF

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.122
DRAFTING THAT'S BECAUSE THAT

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.491
ALLOWS. A VEHICLE IF YOU ARE

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.059
SPREAD OUT THE COST RECOVERY

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:59.428
OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BUT

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.496
IT DOES HAVE HIGHER TRANSACTION

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:01.530
COSTS THAN TRADITIONAL

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:05.067

UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE PC HAS

REQUEST BY AT AND TO DO THAT AND

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.583
IT WAS ACTUALLY DENIED. BY THE

AND RANK ORDER BASED ON THEIR

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:51.040
WRIST BAND EFFICIENCY. THE WE

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:52.108
HAVE METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.210
DEVELOPED OUT OF THOSE

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:54.877
PROCEEDINGS Q. INFORM BASICALLY

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.879
WHERE THE BEST BANG FOR THE

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.914
BUCK- IS NOT FOR THOSE

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.083
INVESTMENTS. WE'RE ALSO

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.252
CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL BY DAY

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.488
UTILITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:07.189
SELF INSURANCE POOLS THIS IS

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.058
BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE SAYING

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.160
SKY ROCKETING INSURANCE PREMIUMS

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.161
AND SO THAT COULD BE AN

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.763
ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE REPAIRS

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.164
ACTUALLY CREATE THEIR OWN

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.699
INSURANCE POOLS. I'M SO THAT'S

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.534
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REVIEWING.

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:19.902
THE PFT- IS ALSO CONSIDERING

ACCOMPLISH THEM OF SPAM- ON THE

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.681
THAT IN. BUT THAT'S AS WELL

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:35.050
BECAUSE WE TO ENSURE THAT THE

STATE SPEND SB- OPERATING MAKING

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:40.022

WE ARE WE CAN EXAMINE RETURN ON

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.893
THAT THAT IS GRANTED TO THE

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.734
PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE BEFORE US

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:57.440
AND- STAKEHOLDERS ARE DEBATING-

01:07:57.506 --> 01:08:00.276

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.214
ON EQUITY- ANOTHER STRATEGY IS

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.348
TO REVIEW OUR NET ENERGY

IN THE MIDST OF DOING THAT.

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.923
RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A PROPOSED

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:16.325

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.518
ESTIMATE AND SO. WHAT THE PUBLIC

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.187
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE MOMENT

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:29.958
IS THAT- THE CURRENT PROJECT IS-

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.393
THREE POINT THREE SEVEN BILLION

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.729
DOLLARS AS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:37.299
AND COULD GROW TO AS MUCH AS SIX

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:41.637
POINT SEVEN. BILLION IN TWENTY

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.906
THIRTY. AT LATIMES CHANGED.

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.574
THANK YOU SUGGEST TO STATE FOR

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.876
THE RECORD THE COST SHIFTED NOT

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.212
ADDRESSING NET ENERGY METERING

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:53.482
WHICH HURTS RENTERS AND LOW

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.017
INCOME FAMILIES WOULD BE AT THE

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:58.186
TUNE OF SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:00.589
DOLLARS IF NOT ADDRESSED BY

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.624
TWENTY THIRTY. CORRECT BASED ON

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:06.528
WHAT YOU JUST SAID. YEAH BUT BUT

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:10.832
BUT OKAY THANK YOU. ALL.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:17.239
STRUCTURE. TWENTY THE- SERVICE

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.441
IS BILL CORK AND- I HAVE A

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.543
QUESTION HERE FIRST F ALL ON

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:24.513
YOUR TRANSMISSION. COSTS DOES

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:27.115
THAT INCLUDE THE COST OF

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:30.218
FIREPROOFING AS WELL AS A NEW

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:36.458
TRANSMISSION. YES THE DOCTOR- WE

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:40.329
ARE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO HE-

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:44.166
SOME COST FOR- TRANSMISSION. SO

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.867
CALLED GRID HARDENING PROJECT

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.135
STARTING TO FACE SOME OF THAT

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.804
SHOWING UP IN AND TRANSMISSION

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:52.541
RATES BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN- A LOT

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:57.145
OF- GET. INVESTMENT IN- AGING

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:59.715
INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE YEARS

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:04.119
AND AT THAT THE COMBINATION OF

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:05.187
THOSE THINGS IF IT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:08.256
SAYING. SO THE- INVESTMENTS FOR

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:11.293
EXAMPLE BY SDG ANNIE WENT UP THE

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.595
FACTOR OF TWO AND A HALF OVER

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:17.032
TEN YEARS. WHEN FROM FOUR

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:20.202
HUNDRED MILLION TO A BILLION.

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:23.171
AND FROM AND A DOUBLE FOR PG&amp;E

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.240
FROM A BILLION TO TWO BILLION.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.875
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.044
CHANGE IN INVESTMENT PER YEAR

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:34.216
CHANGE SO MUCH. A PARTY GIVEN

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:36.351
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A MORE

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:37.586
SPECIFIC RESPONSE AND BREAKDOWN

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:40.288
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.123
TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SIR- WITH

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.524
SOME MORE ADDITIONAL

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:47.829
INFORMATION. ON THAT. I DON'T

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.631
HAVE THE ANSWER FOR YOU- AND AT

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:52.434
THAT. TIME ALL. I'LL SEND YOU

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.670
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ARE AFTER

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.340
THE HEARING. THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:03.145
I APPRECIATE THAT. NO QUESTION

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.146
COLLEAGUES HOLD THIS HOLD THANK

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:07.115
YOU MR I WANTED TO KIND OF GET A

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:10.252
SENSE OF HOW OF THE COSTS OF

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:12.154
ELECTRICITY AND CALIFORNIA

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.158
COMPARES TO OTHER SECTORS OF

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.260
THIS OF THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE WE

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.594
MAY BE DEALING WITH WILDFIRE

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.797
MITIGATION ISSUES YOU HAVE

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.832
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND OTHER

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:26.101
- STATES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:26.968
CREATING A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:30.505
IMPACT. ON RELIABILITY- HOW DO

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:34.743
WE- I MEAN IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.245
. OTHER STATES THAT MAY STILL

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.914
NOT WITHSTANDING SOME OF THESE

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.249
BEING COMPARABLE MAJOR COST

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.219
DRIVERS- THERE STILL MAY HAVE

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:46.054
THEIR RATES A LITTLE BIT LOWER

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:49.658
THAN CALIFORNIA. WHAT ARE WE AND

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.593
IF WE WERE TO COMPARE OURSELVES

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.628
TO MAYBE ONE OF THE OTHER STATES

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:54.463
THAT TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:59.034
NEEDS TRANSMISSION OF COSTS-

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:02.370
RELIABILITY MITIGATION MEASURES.

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:04.439
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.073
EVERYTHING THAT YOU LISTED IN

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.008
YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU CAN

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:10.479
KIND OF GIVE A SENSE ON HOW WE

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:12.581
COMPARE TO OTHERS TO OTHER

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.249
STATES WITHIN THE- THE OF THE

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:18.019
WESTERN STATES AND HOW. WE CAN

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.355
MAYBE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.757
GET OUR COSTS MORE IN LINE WITH

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.593
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER AND

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:30.298
OTHER STATES. RIGHT YEAH SO-

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.200
UNFORTUNATELY I BELIEVE THAT

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.302
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A BIT OF A

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:35.904
CANARY IN THE COAL MINE WHEN IT

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:39.608
COMES TO- EXPERIENCING THAT. THE

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:43.311
WORST OF TAX- UP CLIMATE CHANGE

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:46.281
AND SO WE REALLY ARE SEEING NOW

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:50.519
WILDFIRES AND- YEAH WITH. THE

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:53.255
THEY AFFECT THAT THAT'S HAVING-

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.857
ON ON RATES AND THE NECESSARY

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.126
RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO-

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.495
MITIGATED THE EFFECTS OF

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:04.399
WILDFIRE- CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.567
BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT IN OUR

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.569
INVESTMENT INCLEAN ENERGY

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.671
STRATEGY AND FOR THE MOST PART

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:12.040
THAT HAS. HAS REALLY BENEFITED-

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.542
CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS AND THE

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:16.144
ECONOMY OUR STRATEGY OF THE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:18.547
SENATE SAID THAT THE NINETEEN

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:21.383
EIGHTY AND BEEN A- FINAL PENA

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:22.984
PLEA AND BATH CLEAN ENERGY

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.953
TECHNOLOGY. AND ALSO HELP

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.956
CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE THEIR BILLS

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.625
BY- REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.561
ELECTRICITY THAT THAT CUSTOMERS

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:33.628
CONSUME I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.564
ABOUT- CALIFORNIA GET COUPLING

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:39.234
POLICY. AND THE THOUGHT THAT CAN

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:42.370
ACCOMPANIED BY THE- EFFICIENCY

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:45.640
STANDARDS IN BUILDINGS AND- AND

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.309
APPLIANCES ALSO TRUE UTILITY

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:54.749
PROGRAMS TO HELP CUSTOMERS. TO

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.651
INVEST IN- ENERGY EFFICIENT. AND

01:20:56.718 --> 01:21:00.255
SO WHEN WE BENCHMARK CAL. RATE

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:01.189
TO- UTILITIES AROUND THE WE YOU

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:02.724
FIND CAL HAS SOME OF THE HIGH

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.227
RATES BUT BECAUSE WE DO SO MUCH

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.128
TO ENCOURAGE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:10.165
WE FIND THAT THE- THAT A LECTOR

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.368
BILLS- ARE MORE ARE MORE MIDDLE

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.337
OF THE PACK SO THAT'S BEEN ONE

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.105
OF OUR STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:18.106
REALLY OFFSET THAT BECAUSE AT

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.708
THE END OF THE DAY WHAT MATTERS

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.276
IS WHAT WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.478
SAYING IN TERMS OF THEIR BILLS-

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.080
I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IN IN

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:26.982
RECENT YEARS- WE HAVEN'T BEEN

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.783
ABLE TO BALANCE THAT OUT

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.752
COMPLETELY. AND SO NOW WE REALLY

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:33.121
ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THAT

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:35.423
THAT- THAT STARTING TED TO HIT

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:37.092
THE CUSTOMER BILLS WHICH IS WHY

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.493
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.595
HIGHLIGHT- THAT FACE YOU AND-

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.064
TRYING TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:44.499
ADDRESS THAT THAT AS NOTED

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.500
THROUGH THE AFFORDABILITY

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.469
PROCEEDING TO REALLY LOOK AT

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.237
BOULDER SOLUTION- THAT HAVEN'T

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.772
BEEN CONSIDERED YET AND IN

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:52.207
CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.541
SPECIFICALLY HOW WE BENCHMARK

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.310
AGAINST OTHER UTILITIES IN THE

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:58.713
WEST- I GOT TO TAKE THAT BACK IN

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.283
AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOU-

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.485
DOCUMENTARY- SENATOR ON THAT

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:09.157
BECAUSE WE- HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.659
AT THAT AND GET BACK YOU. A REAL

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:11.826
QUICK WE ALSO TALK ABOUT A

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.229
COUPLE YEARS. WHEN WE WERE.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.430
HAVING HEARING ON THIS ON THIS

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.865
ISSUE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WAS

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.466
LOOKING AT RATE REFORM. IS THAT

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.936
SOMETHING THAT THE CPUC HAS. ARE

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:24.272
LOOKED AT AS A- AN AREA THAT'S

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:29.110
WORTHY OF. EXPLORATION YES THAT

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:32.147
IS A FAMILY MANDATORY ENTERED

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:35.183
OTHER- IT IS ONE OF THE

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.085
STRATEGIES THAT- THAT WE ARE

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.353
LOOKING AT SO AND THE

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.489
LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE- IN AB

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.692
THREE TWENTY FIVE AND- IN SOME

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:45.060
OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON RATE

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.462
DESIGN AND- AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.431
WE OPENED THAT RESIDENTIAL RATE

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:49.964
WITH ONE PROCEEDING WHICH

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:53.168
RESULTED IN. A TRANSITION TOP OF

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.704
THE- THE SHARPEST INCLINING

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:59.607
BLOCK RATE HERE NOW- TIME OF USE

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:01.576
RATES AND WE'RE FINDING THAT-

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.545
THAT IS- WE'RE HAVING SOME

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.413
SUCCESS WITH THAT. ONE OF THE

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.383
OTHER- RATE REFORM STRATEGY

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.752
THAT- WAS MENTIONED AS ONE OF

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.887
THE STRATEGIES AND- STAKEHOLDERS

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.189
TO PUT FORWARD AND-

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.257
AFFORDABILITY ON BONTA IS TO IS

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:22.397
TO LOOK OUT. HOW HOW SOME OF

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.265
THE- X. CLASS- THAT YOU'RE- AND

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.768
- COULD BE RECOVERED. OPTICS

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.636
CHARGE AB PRESENTLY RESIDENTIAL

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:32.173
FIXED ARE CAPPED AT. 10% PER

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.542
STATUTE- AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:36.444
THAT YOU KNOW LEGISLATION TO RE

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:40.348
LOOK AT THAT. MIGHT BE HELPFUL

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:43.752
TO- CHANGE THE WAY THAT- COSTS

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:46.287
ARE ARE RECOVERED AND THAT

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.523
ACCOMPANIED WITH- YEAH LOOKING

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.226
AT WAYS THAT- THAT COULD BE DONE

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.995
WITHOUT WE'RE PROGRESSIVELY-

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:57.132
HAVING AN EFFECT ON ON THE LOWER

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.400
INCOME CUSTOMERS. MIGHT BE A WAY

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.534
OF GOING ABOUT THAT BUT THERE'S

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:02.070
A LOT OF ISSUES TO LOOK AT WITH

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.972
REGARD TO THAT AND ADVOCATING-

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:06.808
IT WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND-

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.910
AND AT THAT THING EXTENT TO

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.011
WHICH WE NEED ADDITIONAL

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:14.015
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:16.284
TO TAKE ACTION ON THAT FRONT.

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.452
BUT YOU THANK YOU OF SOME

BAKER I AM AND LOOKING AT TO. A

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:31.199
INFORMATIONAL- HEARING- A

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:34.369
WRITTEN BRIEFING- THAT- HAS BEEN

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.137
DISTRICT DISTRIBUTED TO THE

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.872
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M NOT SURE

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.874
IF YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS BUT-

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:42.177
WHAT WHAT ONE THING THAT TO.

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.411
WAS NOT AWARE OF I PROBABLY

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:44.712
SHOULD BE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.581
OF BUT- THAT THE STATEMENT IS

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.017
MADE THAT TO. THAT THE ACTUAL

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:51.186
ELECTRIC BILL THAT THE AVERAGE

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.054
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER IN THE

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:54.489
STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS IS

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:56.090
ACTUALLY BELOW THE NATIONAL

01:24:56.157 --> 01:25:00.295
AVERAGE- LARGELY BECAUSE OF

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.297
CALIFORNIA'S MOD CLIMATE. AND A

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.164
STRONG COMMITMENT TO ENERGY

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.066
EFFICIENCY I THINK THE I THINK

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.901
YOU. YOU OF GOD INDICATED WE

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.970
MIGHT BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:09.871
PACK BUT IT DOES THAT SOUND

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.406
ACCURATE THAT WE WE'RE WE'RE

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:12.140
ACTUALLY BELOW THE NATIONAL

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:16.110
AVERAGE. YEAH I'M SURE THAT'S

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.145
ACCURATE I WAS SHOOTING FROM THE

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.113
HIP A LITTLE BIT WHEN I SAID

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.316
THAT- METAL ACT I GUESS WORK BY

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.418
PEOPLE OF THE PACK. OKAY BUT BUT

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:26.721
STILL YET- AS AS- THIS DOCUMENT

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.022
INDICATES AS WELL AS YOUR

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:31.426
PRESENTATION I MEAN- CLEARLY

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:32.994
WHAT WHEN OUR RATES ARE.

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:34.796
DISTINGUISHING ARE THE ELECTRIC

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.798
RATES FROM THE ACTUAL BILL THE

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.934
CUSTOMER PAYS- BUT BUT THE RATES

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:41.836
BEING DOUBLING AND TRIPLING THAT

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.472
THAT THAT IS CLEARLY A- CAUSE

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.641
FOR ALARM AND I DON'T WANT TO.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:51.412
DIMINISH THAT FACT- THE WRITTEN

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.115
MATERIALS ALSO INDICATES THAT-

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.583
THAT COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:59.888
AGGREGATORS- ARE CURRENTLY SERVE

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:06.194
ABOUT 28% OF THE- I OWE YOU-

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:10.298
LOAD- IS THE GROWING PERCENTAGE

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:14.068
OF. THE LOAD BEING SERVED BY

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.803
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS A

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.539
CONTRIBUTING IN ANY WAY TO THE

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:22.744
INCREASES AND- AND- ELECTRIC

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:30.885
RATES. AT THE MOMENT IF I MAY I

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.554
HAVE- ONE OF MY RATES EXPERTS ON

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.156
THE LINE PULP THE LET'S AND- I'D

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.025
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REFER THAT

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.059
QUESTION TO HIM IF I MAKE IT

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:40.628
SUPERVISOR FOR- OUR ELECTRIC

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:46.134
BREAKING. CAN SOMEONE- I'M GONNA

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.002
KEEP MY CAMERA OFF THIS IS PAUL

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.671
PHILLIPS I'M HAVING SOME

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:50.305
CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WHILE BEING

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:52.173
REMOTE SO- AND I BELIEVE YOUR

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.708
QUESTION IS ABOUT WHETHER A

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:56.010
CABINET CHOICE ACT. AGGREGATORS

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:58.746
ARE- CREATING MORE PRESSURE ON

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:02.650
RATES CENTRALLY THROUGH LOW. IS

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.386
THAT THE QUESTION YES- I THINK

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:07.589
WE CAN SAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT BUT

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:10.258
IT'S NOT A PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.059
RATE PRESSURES THAT WE'RE

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.727
EXPERIENCING SO- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:14.295
WHAT'S EALLY HAPPENING WITH. A

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.830
CHOICE AGGREGATORS- THAT ARE

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.298
THERE ARE STILL WORKING THEIR

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.266
OWN GENERATION PORTFOLIO WHICH

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.001
GENERALLY IS CHEAPER. R. FOR

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.769
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND- WHILE

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.071
MAINTAINING A TRANSMISSION AND

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.472
DISTRIBUTION RATES FROM THE-

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.407
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. SO IN

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.276
DOING SO TECHNICALLY THOSE

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:29.143
CUSTOMERS ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.312
EXPERIENCING ARE POTENTIALLY

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.648
CHEAPER RATES- BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.482
THAT THEY'RE NECESSARILY

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:36.884
CREATING AS MUCH. PRESSURE ON

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.087
THE SALES COMPONENT OF RATES AS

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:42.056
SAY THE- A ROOFTOP SOLAR CROWD

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:44.025
IS SO A DEFECTION TO ROOFTOP

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.761
SOLAR. IS INCREASING THE

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:50.064
ACCELERATION IN DECLINING SALES.

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.899
OF OUR RATES FASTER THAN THE

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:54.035
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION OF

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.903
COMPONENTS OF THE MARKET PLACE

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.472
YES SO I THINK YOU I WOULDN'T

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.140
COUNT THAT AS A PRIMARY FACTOR

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:01.776
HERE- AS MUCH AS THAT WOULD BE-

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:05.380
THAT THE DEFECTION TO. US ON THE

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.581
ROOFTOP. THE YOU COULD GO.

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:07.615
CLARIFY FOR ME LIKE HOW THE

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.418
DECLINING SALES. MAY TRANSLATE

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:14.288
INTO A- AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT IN

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:16.357
TERMS OF INCREASE AND- RATE. AND

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:21.162
RATES. SURE SO I MEAN THE BASIC

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.730
RATE EQUATION- JUST TAKING SORT

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.632
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:25.233
REQUIREMENT FOR AN INVESTOR

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.834
OWNED UTILITY AND DIVIDING THAT

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.136
BY THE KILOWATT HOUR SALES FOR

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.904
THAT TERRITORY WOULD GIVE YOU A

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.572
SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGE RATES AND SO

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:32.774
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE BASING

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.308
THIS ON THAT AS- SMALL

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.344
PERCENTAGES PER YEAR OF DECLINE

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:37.612
IN KILOWATT HOUR SALES RESULTS

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:40.715
FROM- GROWTH. IN SOLAR MARKET-

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:42.617
MANY CUSTOMERS ARE- PROVIDING

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.252
THEIR OWN GENERATION FOR

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:45.687
THEMSELVES AND THEN YOU KNOW OF

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:46.287
COURSE THROUGH THE NET ENERGY

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.321
METERING TERRACE. OF FEEDING

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:48.990
BACK ANY EXCESS GENERATION TO

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.291
THE GRID AND GETTING A SMALL

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:53.227
CREDIT FOR IT- THAT MARKET PLACE

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.929
IS DRYING YOU KNOW I DON'T OF

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.664
ITS ON AN INCREASING BASIS BUT

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.633
IT'S NOT A PRETTY STEADY BASIS-

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.867
INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN SALES PER

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:02.303
YEAR SO AS THE DENOMINATOR. IS

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:04.372
SHRINKING- WHILE YOU KNOW

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.873
REVENUE IS EITHER REMAINING

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.376
STEADY OR GROWING THOSE RATES

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:11.212
ARE INCREASING. OKAY I GET IT-

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:14.782
ENTERED AYE MAN YES. YES IF I

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:16.684
MADE HIM AND TOOK THE TIME TO

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.486
MAKE ONE DETECTION SO- WHAT

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.520
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:22.090
TERMS OF CREATED- FAILED TO

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:25.426
BROWN- FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR FOR

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:28.429
EXAMPLE THOSE- THOSE SAME CAUGHT

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:29.997
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE RECOVERED

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:31.165
AND SO THERE AND THEN RECOVERED

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:35.269
FROM FROM ALL BUNDLED CUSTOMERS-

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:37.505
INCLUDING THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT-

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:39.407
THAT DON'T HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:42.243
BUT WHEN- WHEN A CUSTOMER GOES

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:45.580
TO AT HVGA- IN THEORY THE COSTS

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:48.049
GO WITH THEM BECAUSE- WHAT THE

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:52.386
LAW REQUIRES THAT- THAT AT SIXTY

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.387
EIGHT THAT THERE BE A RATEPAYER

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:58.593
IN DIFFERENT- A PRINCIPAL THERE-

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:01.129
WHEN AT U. K. FORMED IN. SO WE

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:04.165
HAVE. VERY COMPLEX AND LITIGIOUS

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.366
TO REVIEW THE CAUGHT AT TECH

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:08.269
WITH THAT EPA CUTS SO CALLED

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:09.804
POWER CHARGING WHICH BUT IS AND

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.673
HOW OF RACE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.377
DO THAT- BUT THERE ARE THERE-

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:19.280
ABOUT- WHICH CONCERT- TO

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.449
TRANSFER OUT WITH FIFTY KA

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.618
CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY- WENT OUT

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:28.956
LOW DEPART. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU-

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:35.630
IN TERMS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. I

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:40.168
MEAN IS THERE A- IT IS THERE A

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.003
THRESHOLD IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:45.406
PERCENTAGE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AT

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.909
WHICH WE STARTED SEEING AN

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.311
IMPACT IN A REDUCTION IN THE

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.113
TRANSMISSION AND DISPOSITION

01:30:52.180 --> 01:31:00.855
COSTS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE.

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:04.959
YEAH I DON'T- I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:07.228
WE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.464
THRESHOLD I THAT AS A RULE OF

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:12.633
THUMB- CERTAINLY THE EXTENT TO

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.503
WHICH OUR ROOFTOP SOLAR AND

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.772
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES-

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:20.041
CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCTION IN

01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:22.476
TRANSMISSION COSTS AND

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.812
DISTRIBUTION COSTS AS WELL IT

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:27.648
IT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE PC HAS

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:29.417
GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO AND

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.118
HAS HAS REALLY REVIEWED

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.588
EXTENSIVELY IN PROCEEDING TO TRY

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:35.556
TO DETERMINE IF RELIABLE

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.525
METHODOLOGY. ANY OTHER QUANTIFY

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:40.394
THOSE CAUGHT- COULD BE DEVELOPED

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:42.363
AN AND ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.166
AND FOR THE MOST PART AFTER

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:48.035
EXTENSIVE REVIEW REVIEW OF THAT

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:49.337
QUESTION HE HAS NOT FOUND THAT

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:53.007
THERE ARE- DEFENDABLE

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.376
METHODOLOGY TO DO THAT AND THAT

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:57.879
IS A DISPUTED ISSUE AND WE KNOW

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.380
THAT THERE ARE PARTY THAT I

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.183
BELIEVE THAT THOSE- BUT- THAT. A

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.719
LARGE AMOUNT OF THOSE COSTS CAN

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:06.420
BE AVOIDED WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.856
SOME OF IT CAN- BUT TO BE ABLE

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.291
TO PROTECT THE CAR NOT

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:11.559
QUANTIFIED NOT BAD THE CHALLENGE

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.927
WE DO HAVE A SPECIFIC

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.095
METHODOLOGY THAT HAPPENED

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.964
DEVELOP SPORT UTILITY TO FOR

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.332
EXAMPLE AND- PLANNING THEIR

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.401
DISTRIBUTION ELECTRIC GRID. BUT

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:23.237
LOOK AT THE NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:25.139
DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:27.241
TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:34.582
PROJECT DONE ON SPECIFIC. A

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:37.184
LECTURER. EATERS ARE AREAS OF

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.252
SYSTEM. THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.388
DEFERRED- BY A STORAGE PROJECT-

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:42.957
AND SO WE HAVE- THE POLICY

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:45.159
WHEREBY FUTURE. ARE WE TO GO THE

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:48.596
BACK. AND HE YEAH- EXTENT OF

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:50.197
THOSE STORAGE PROJECT ANOTHER

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.465
DISTRIBUTING YOUR RESOURCES

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:54.001
COULD BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.403
TO BUILDING ANOTHER SUBSTATION

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.471
OR ANOTHER DISTRIBUTION LINE-

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.240
WE'VE HAD SOME TALKS WITH BETH

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:00.875
AND THAT AREA. AND THOSE ARE

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.644
EXAMPLES WHERE- WHERE DOES THAT

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:06.247
THE BENEFIT OF NOT BUILDING A

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:07.682
DISTRIBUTION. A PIECE OF

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:08.883
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.551
SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THE

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.620
DISTURBING NATURE RESOURCES-

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.957
BUT- OTHER CONTACT AND BY H.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:18.826
THAT THAT TIE ISN'T SO DIRECT IS

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.895
WHERE THE DEBATE- CONTINUES TO

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:26.867
LIVE- AND- IN THE STAKEHOLDER.

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:28.035
COMMUNITY AND THEN ARE PUSHING.

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:32.406
BUT IT I UNDERSTAND THAT- IT'S A

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:35.376
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND THAT- THE

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:37.511
IMPACT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AS IT

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:40.748
RELATES TO. TRANSMISSION COSTS

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:44.085
MAY BE YOU KNOW THIS WITHOUT.

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:47.421
VERY CONTEXTUAL ESPECIALLY

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:49.223
RELATED TO THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:53.761
PENETRATION OF ROOFTOP SOLAR-

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:56.263
BOB BETTER RIGHT I MEAN IN

01:33:56.330 --> 01:34:00.401
GENERAL IS THE- YOU KNOW IT IS

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.536
THERE ANY- AT LEAST

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:07.241
CONSIDERATION OF. THE LOWER NEED

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.310
FOR A TRANSMISSION AND

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:11.278
DISTRIBUTION FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:13.180
THAT'S CALCULATED INTO THE COST

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:16.350
SHIFT ANALYSIS- RELATED TO THAT

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.285
YOU KNOW IN THE ONTEX OF NIGHT

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:21.922
NOW SHE METERING. YES SIR- SO WE

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:26.160
HAVE- APPRECIATING THAT- A

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:30.164
REVIEWS- A METHODOLOGY CALLED A

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:33.267
BOYCOTT WHICH BASICALLY LOOK AT-

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:34.301
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:38.606
UTILITY OF REDUCE GENERATION-

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:39.774
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.109
PURCHASE TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.611
AND DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:44.879
THERE ARE METHODOLOGIES AND

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:47.314
NETWORKING. THAT QUANTIFY THE

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.682
BENEFIT OF ABOVE WHAT A

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:49.950
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:51.452
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT I WITH

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.422
ELABORATING EARLIER IS- BUT

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.323
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:59.260
THAT AND DISPUTE- AND PARTY THAT

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:02.930
BELIEVES THAT THOSE- THOSE.

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:05.499
VALUES ARE ARE UNDERSTATED- AND

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:07.468
I WAS JUST- ALIVE RATING THAT

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:16.577
THAT THE SUBJECT OF- A TECHNICAL. DEBATE ALL RIGHT. THE LAST.

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:21.482
FOR MY AND- AS- THE STATE OF

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.251
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO PURSUE

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.420
ITS GOAL OF HAVING A HUNDRED

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:29.390
PERCENT- CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:33.594
PRODUCING OUR ELECTRICITY ARM.

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:38.732
IS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE- WHY

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:42.203
AND AS WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:44.238
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION-

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:51.045
GRADE. TO MEET NEW SOURCES OF-

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:53.514
SOLAR AND WIND ESPECIALLY

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.617
OFFSHORE WIND- IS THAT PROJECTED

01:35:56.684 --> 01:36:02.256
TO BE A- YOU KNOW A- A NAFTA

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:06.427
REDUCTION IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW-

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.663
ELECTRICITY RATES OR A ON A NET

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:17.538
INCREASE. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:22.376
WE DID- INTERAGENCY STUDY ON SB

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.577
ONE HUNDRED AND I'M NOT

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.713
RECALLING THE TYPICALLY- WHAT

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:28.949
THE- THE OVERALL SYSTEM WIDE

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:31.185
BILL IMPACT WORD THAT WERE

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.953
AFFECTED PART OF THAT BODY BUT

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.355
WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK ON

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.823
THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT DATA

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.758
POINT TO GET BACK TO YOU ONE ALL

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:39.894
RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.128
YOU THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.796
QUESTION- AND I THINK THAT-

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.198
WITHOUT HAVING LOOKED AT THAT

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:46.500
STUDY I WOULD IMAGINE THAT.

01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:50.838
WOULD PROBABLY ARE ADDING COST-

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.273
AND SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:55.743
TO. FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MINIMIZE

01:36:55.809 --> 01:37:01.048
THAT- AND- TRANSMISSION IS VERY

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:07.555
COSTLY- I THE OF THE- COST ON

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:11.425
OTHER- LEGACY- PROGRAMS AT THE

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.794
CPC WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:15.596
QUESTIONS I HAVE I THINK WE

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:17.698
SHOULD ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT NOT

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.733
JUST A HONE IN ON THEM I THINK

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.435
THERE'S A SERIES OF OTHER

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:21.936
PROGRAMS WHICH WILL BE A

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:23.871
QUESTION FOR THE CPC A

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.339
COMMISSIONER WITH US AND ACTOR

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:26.674
BUT BUT BUT IF WIND AND SOLAR

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.841
AND WIND AND SOLAR BECOME

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.109
CHEAPER THAN THAT SAY NATURAL

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:31.512
GAS THEN. PERHAPS THAT YOU KNOW

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:33.180
IT WOULDN'T BE SO OBVIOUS THAT

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:34.848
YOU WOULD BE A CORRECT A DRIVER

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.584
OF INCREASED HELLO WE ARE ALSO

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:38.485
TALKING ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES-

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:39.753
THAT WERE WANTING TO INTEGRATE

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.388
THAT THAT I THINK DESERVE A

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:45.092
VERY- THOROUGH ANALYSIS RIGHT-

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:47.061
FOR PURPOSES OF LOOKING AT THIS

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:47.995
COMPREHENSIVELY BUT THAT'S A

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.630
GOOD QUESTION AND WITHOUT

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:50.965
LOOKING AT THE STUDY I'M GONNA

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:53.634
GUESS NO PROBABLY ABOUT COST

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.569
CONTACTS YOU KNOW THAT. HEADS OR

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:57.204
TAILS WHICH WENT THAT WHICH

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.039
DIRECTION IS GONNA GO AND I

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.708
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WHAT THE

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:01.842
OUTCOME MIGHT BE BUT THAT COULD

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:06.280
QUESTIONS TAKE IS A MEMBER- SOME

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:07.014
APPRECIATIVE QUESTIONS. THANK

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:09.216
YOU MISTER CHAIR IT MORE OF A- I

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.284
THINK POTENTIAL CLOSING COMMENT

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.186
ON ON THIS ON THIS PANEL BEFORE

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:14.488
WE MOVE ON TO THE SECOND. OR THE

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.423
SECOND SPEAKER APOLOGIES. YOU

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.392
KNOW IT JUST IT STRIKES ME THAT

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:21.128
WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME IN WHICH

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:22.029
TO THE INCREASE OF FOSSIL FUELS

01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:25.099
AND- ESPECIALLY AT THE- AT THE

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:27.601
PUMP. WHEN FOLKS ARE TRYING TO

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:29.737
FILL UP THEIR GAS TANK AND- THE

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:30.738
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.973
LEGISLATURE WANTING TO CREATE

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.375
SOLUTIONS THAT ULTIMATELY HELP

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:35.809
PEOPLE BECAUSE COSTS ARE SO

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.178
EXPENSIVE RIGHT RIGHT NOW AT THE

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.380
MOMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:41.382
SEE SOMETHING THAT'S VISIBLE AT

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.083
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.485
ACTUALLY GO YOU FEEL IT

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:47.054
IMMEDIATELY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.589
THAT IS DELIVERED IN THE MAIL OR

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:51.592
ONLINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:53.294
BILLS THAT YOU PAY FOR ENERGY.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.628
AND O I'M I'M STRUCK BY THE

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:57.164
COMMENTS SHARED BY THE BY THE P.

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:58.699
YOU SEE IN TERMS OF NET ENERGY

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.868
METERING AS RELATED TO ROOFTOP

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:03.937
SOLAR. THAT SINCE TWENTY

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.340
THIRTEEN THE P. YOU SEE HAS BEEN

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:09.376
MANDATED. TO FIND A FIX FOR THE

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:13.080
COST SHIFT. NINE YEARS LATER.

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:17.785
THE P. UC HAS STILL NOT ACTED.

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:20.854
TO WHEN THEY WILL. IT'S NOW IN

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.256
JUDICIAL REVIEW IF THEY'RE STILL

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:23.357
COMMITTEES THERE'S A NEW

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.693
DIRECTOR IT'S A CONSTANT HAVING

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:29.863
TO START OVER. WHILE RENTERS AND

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.665
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CONTINUE

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:35.235
TO FEEL. THE BURDEN AND YOU KNOW

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:35.936
I JUST FIND THAT TO BE A

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:38.172
COMPLETE DISREGARD TO THE

01:39:38.238 --> 01:39:41.608
LEGISLATURE. TO POLICY THAT HAS

01:39:41.675 --> 01:39:44.244
BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW TO

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.513
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE HAVE

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:48.015
BEEN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS FOR

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:50.784
MULTIPLE YEARS NOW AND HAVE YET

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:52.286
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONCLUSION

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:54.154
FROM THE P. YOU SEE ON WHEN

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:56.323
EXACTLY THEY ARE GOING TO FIX.

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.425
THE COST SHIFT THAT IMPACTS

01:39:58.492 --> 01:39:59.760
RENTERS ON LOW INCOME

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:03.497
COMMUNITIES. THIS FAILURE TO DO

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:06.233
SO JUST IS INCREDIBLY TELLING.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.469
AT THE LACK OF RESPONSE TOWARDS

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:10.237
AGAIN RENTERS ON LOW INCOME

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:12.339
COMMUNITIES THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:14.375
COSTING THREE POINT THREE

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:17.378
BILLION DOLLARS AND A PROJECTED

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.913
COST OF SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION.

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.083
BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND SO I JUST

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:25.085
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:27.187
THAT WE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY ASKED

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:30.257
THESE QUESTIONS. AND THE PUCT

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:31.825
KEEPS DRAGGING AND CHANGING. THE

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:35.262
GOAL POST. I'M NOT OKAY WITH

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:36.663
THAT AND I DON'T THINK ANY

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.132
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:41.869
BE OKAY WITH THE FACT THAT SINCE

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.370
TWENTY THIRTEEN THE PC HAS BEEN

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:44.471
MANDATED TO ADDRESS THE COST

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:45.939
SHIFT AND HAS FAILED TO DO SO

01:40:46.006 --> 01:40:47.441
HOW MANY MORE HEARINGS MISTER

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.543
CHAIR ARE WE GOING TO HAVE

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:50.711
BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY DECIDE TO

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:53.480
ACT. THAT'S I THANK YOU FOR

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.182
THOSE COMMENTS AND I WOULD ALIGN

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:56.850
MY- COMMENTS WITH THAT YOUR

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:59.253
STATEMENTS. I DO HAVE A COUPLE

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:01.655
OF QUESTIONS- MISTER BAKER AND

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:04.558
ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE RECENT

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:06.026
CQC AUDIT- THE OTHER HAS TO DO

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.327
MORE SPECIFICALLY TO LEGACY

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:09.096
PROGRAMS AND SEE IF. THERE IS.

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.365
SOME ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN DONE

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:13.233
WE MET WITH THE PRESIDENCY PC

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.437
HERE NOT LONG AGO- PERHAPS. SOME

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:17.838
FOLKS WENT BACK TO TAKE A LOOK

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.724
TOO DOGGONE HIGH. YOU KNOW THE

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.093
THING I HAVE TO MAKE A COMMENT

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.794
ABOUT THE RATES VERSUS BILLS

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:36.529
DISCUSSION EARLIER BECAUSE IT'S

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:40.033
REALLY IMPORTANT. UTILITY BILLS

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.303
DO NOT EXIST IN A VACUUM. YOU DO

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:46.806
NOT HAVE A GASOLINE BILL IN

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:47.807
OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T PAY FOR

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.576
GASOLINE UNLESS YOU OWN AN

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:51.945
AUTOMOBILE OKAY YOU'RE NOT JUST

01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:54.114
BY SO YOU DON'T HAVE UTILITY

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.516
BILL UNLESS YOU HAVE A HOME TO

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:59.019
LIVE IN. AND SO WHILE IT MAY BE

01:50:59.085 --> 01:51:02.422
THAT THE COST OF ENERGY BILLS IN

01:51:02.489 --> 01:51:05.191
CALIFORNIA IS. RELATIVELY LOW

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.160
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:08.061
COUNTRY I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:10.263
HEALTH THE PRICE THE PRICE OF

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.932
LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA PERHAPS

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.601
THE NATION AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.903
AT UTILITY BILLS AS A BUNDLE

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:23.376
UTILITY IS PART OF HOUSING. THE

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:26.046
UTILITY BILLS AND WHEN IT OES

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:27.747
UP TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH THIRTY

01:51:27.814 --> 01:51:29.682
DOLLARS A MONTH. FIFTY DOLLARS A

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:31.317
MONTH LIKE SOME OF THESE

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:32.819
PROPOSALS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:34.220
US. THAT IS WHAT'S HURTING

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:36.990
PEOPLE. FOR ALL TODAY I AM GOING

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.625
TO OFFER FOUR DISTINCT

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:41.227
STRATEGIES. FOR CONTAINING COUGH

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:43.863
AND CONTROLLING BILLS. EACH THAT

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:45.365
ARE WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:49.235
LEGISLATURE TO WIN THAT. ONE

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:51.671
DEVELOP NON RATE PAIR FUNDING

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:54.340
STREAMS FOR ONCE IN A-

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.309
GENERATION COSTS THAT ARE

01:51:56.376 --> 01:52:00.447
EXTRAORDINARY. YET URGENT.

01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:02.649
REPAIRS HAVE ALREADY PAID IN

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:06.186
WILDFIRE MITIGATION COSTS SIX

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:09.322
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:13.293
BILLIONS MORE PROPOSED. THE

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:15.261
LEGISLATURE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:17.464
TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC AND REYES

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:21.101
EQUITY BY ADOPTING TAXPAYER

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:24.604
FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:27.674
TO REPLACE RATEPAYER FUNDING

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:30.477
REDUCING WILDFIRE PARTICULAR

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:33.246
EMISSIONS ADVANCED STATE CLIMATE

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:35.582
GOALS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:37.784
ESPECIALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:42.322
COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK. THE

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:44.791
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO REPLACE

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:46.793
REPAIR FUNDING OF CLIMATE

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.695
INITIATIVE THROUGH STATE

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:50.830
FUNDING. I'D LIKE TO GIVE ONE

01:52:50.897 --> 01:52:53.399
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:56.236
CAN UTILIZE THE NINE HUNDRED AND

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:57.403
SIXTY TWO MILLION MILLION

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.305
DOLLARS FOUR BUILDING

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:01.207
ELECTRIFICATION IN THE

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:04.177
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:05.612
REPLACE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:53:05.678 --> 01:53:09.015
EDISON REQUEST FOR SIX HUNDRED

01:53:09.082 --> 01:53:10.116
AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:12.719
DOLLARS IN RAPE THEIR FUNDING

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:16.256
FOR BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:17.557
THAT'S JUST ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:20.426
. SO THE SECOND STRATEGY BUT THE

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:22.829
LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT IS TO

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:26.032
REQUIRE THE CPC TO REVIEW

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:29.068
INFLATION CONSTRAIN PROPOSALS.

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:31.738
AND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.641
RATE INCREASE PROPOSALS PRIOR TO

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:38.845
APPROVING ANY RATE INCREASE.

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:40.280
OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS THE

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:41.981
COMMISSION A FLAP EDISON

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:46.920
CUSTOMERS WITH A 20% INCREASE BY

01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:49.355
APPROVING TWO POINT ONE BILLION

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:51.591
DOLLARS IN RATE INCREASES. FOR

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.794
PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS IN THE FIRST

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:57.463
THREE MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:00.099
TWO ALONE. IT IS NEARLY 20%

01:54:00.166 --> 01:54:02.969
INCREASE. AND THAT REPRESENTS

01:54:03.036 --> 01:54:05.371
ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:07.307
BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:11.411
THE 30% PROPOSED. GENERAL RATE

01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:14.581
INCREASE THAT WOULD START IN

01:54:14.647 --> 01:54:17.417
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE

01:54:17.483 --> 01:54:20.153
LEGISLATURE CAN REQUIRE

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.022
UTILITIES TO SUBMIT INFLATION

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:26.960
CONSTRAINED RATE PROPOSAL. A

01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:30.463
LONG FIVE OF THEIR SKY'S THE

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.866
LIMIT INCREASE PROPOSAL FOR THAT

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:37.804
WAY INSTEAD OF THE CPU FREE.

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:42.775
ONLY USING THE SKY HIGH PROPOSAL

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:45.211
AT THE STARTING POINT AND THEN

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:47.847
HAVING TO WORK DOWN. THE PC

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:51.150
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:52.318
USE INFLATION OF THE STARTING

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:54.420
POINT. AND REQUIRE THE UTILITY

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:57.523
TO JUSTIFY EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR

01:54:57.590 --> 01:55:00.560
OVER INFLATION. DARTING POINTS

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:02.929
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU'RE

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:05.331
TRYING TO DO BUDGETING AND IF

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.766
YOU WANT TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.435
ON THE SUGGEST THAT HAVING A

01:55:09.502 --> 01:55:10.970
LOWER STARTING POINT TO START

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:13.773
WITH. GIVEN ADVANTAGE TO A

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.276
STARTING POINT BUT HAS NO LIMIT

01:55:16.342 --> 01:55:18.945
WHATSOEVER RIGHT NOW THE PROBLEM

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:21.547
IS THE UTILITIES CAN ASK FOR

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:24.083
WHATEVER THEY WANT ANYTIME THEY

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.953
WANT. AND THE THREE P. THREE HAS

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.756
THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT AS LARGE

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:32.859
OF AN INCREASE AS IT DEEMS FIT

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:34.894
WHENEVER IT WANTS THERE ARE NO

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:36.396
CONSTRAINTS AT ALL BUT THE

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.064
LEGISLATURE CAN AT LEAST HELP

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:43.436
PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE. THREE

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:45.905
THE THIRD STRATEGY ADOPT POINT

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:48.241
OF SALE AND OTHER REVENUE

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:50.410
GENERATING STRATEGIES TO HELP

01:55:50.476 --> 01:55:52.545
CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLIMATE

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:56.482
GOALS. THAT HAVE TO PARTICULAR

01:55:56.549 --> 01:56:00.186
FEATURES ZERO RATEPAYER DOLLARS

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:04.123
. M. ZERO TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:08.127
LET ME GIVE JUST ONE EXAMPLE. SO

01:56:08.194 --> 01:56:09.762
TURNER'S BEEN FLOATING A

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:12.165
PROPOSAL ON TRANSPORTATION

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:14.133
ELECTRIFICATION THAT WOULD

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.004
REPLACE RATEPAYER REVENUE WITH

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:19.906
POINT TO FILL REVENUE. AND THIS

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:22.375
IS HOW IT WORKS SO THE AVERAGE

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:24.310
PRICE OF A NEW CAR IN CALIFORNIA

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:26.546
IS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:27.780
FORTY EIGHT IN CHANGE BUT YOU

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:29.615
KNOW WE'RE GONNA FADE FIFTY JUST

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:32.618
MAKE THE MAPPING THING. 32%

01:56:32.685 --> 01:56:35.388
CARBON FEE OKAY MAYBE ABOUT A

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:37.090
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VEHICLE NOW

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:38.658
YOU TAKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:42.695
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:44.764
VEHICLES THAT OPERATE BY THE

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:46.599
AFFLUENT AND SOLD EVERY YEAR

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.101
MULTIPLY THAT BY THE THOUSAND

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:50.503
DOLLARS YOU GET ONE POINT FIVE

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:52.772
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO BUY

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:56.709
DOWN THE COST. OF THE V. THE

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:58.745
BILL CHARGING STATIONS AND TO DO

01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:01.514
OTHER INVESTMENTS. NOW THAT

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:03.516
HAPPENED TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:05.418
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FOR

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:07.687
THAT IF A CUSTOMER COMPLAINS WHY

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:08.855
FOR THE PAY THE THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:10.990
FOR THIS CURVE IN FEET. THEY CAN

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.759
BE DIRECTED TO AN ELECTRIC

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:16.529
VEHICLE WHOSE COST IS LOWER

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:20.299
BECAUSE OF DEFEAT. I WILL JUST

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:22.335
SAY OF THE NOTE THAT THIS

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.871
PARTICULAR PRO PROPOSAL BECAUSE

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:27.273
IT'S LOCATED AT CAR DEALERSHIPS.

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:30.810
WOULD EXEMPT PATHOLOGICAL. WHICH

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.278
I ACTUALLY DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:34.947
SUBSIDIES BECAUSE 80% OF

01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:36.916
CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:39.318
TOUGH FOR VEHICLES AND THE FACT

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.020
IS THAT IN THE YEAR TWENTY

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:43.089
TWENTY ONE. TOUGH FOR WITH THE

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.425
NUMBER TWO CAR SELLERS IN THE

01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:48.294
STATE JEFF AFTER TOYOTA AHEAD OF

01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:50.263
HONDA I DON'T BELIEVE TESLA

01:57:50.329 --> 01:57:52.365
ACTUALLY NEED SUBSIDIES AT THIS

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.700
POINT THEY ARE VERY SUCCESFUL

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.903
L. ONE MYSELF NO SERIOUSLY THEY

01:57:56.969 --> 01:58:01.340
ARE FOR. THEM TO GO TO- GO TO

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.775
NUMBER FOUR BECAUSE I WANNA KEEP

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:04.844
MY REMARKS RELATIVELY SHORT SO

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:09.482
THAT WE CAN- YOU KNOW GET INTO A

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.149
DISCUSSION. SO THE FOR AND THIS

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:11.851
IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.619
SPEAKS TO WHAT SHERMAN GARCIA

01:58:13.686 --> 01:58:16.355
JEFF SAID. I'M GOING TO SUGGEST

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:17.790
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:20.293
LEGISLATORS TO STOP ADOPTING

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:22.595
CLEAN ENERGY MANDATES THAT

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:24.764
INCREASE MONTHLY RATE PAYER

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:29.035
BILLS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS

01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:31.637
A LOT IF I GET UPSET A LOT WHEN

01:58:31.704 --> 01:58:33.272
I SEE BILLS THAT ARE PASSED BY

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:35.475
BY THIS COMMITTEE AND BY YOUR

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:36.509
COLLEAGUES THEY'RE GONNA RAISE

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:38.911
RAISE RATES BUT WHAT I REALIZE

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:41.481
IS ACTUALLY WHAT CHAIR GARCIA

01:58:41.547 --> 01:58:44.650
DID. BUT A LOT OF TIMES ALL YOU

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:46.953
HAVE TO. OPERATE IS THE

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:50.890
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:52.959
ANALYZE THE COUGH THE BILLS AND

01:58:53.025 --> 01:58:55.595
THEN ONLY ANALYZE THE COUGH THE

01:58:55.661 --> 01:58:57.497
STATE AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THEY

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:59.599
DO NOT ANALYZE THE RATEPAYER

01:58:59.665 --> 01:59:01.434
IMPACT WHICH YOU BROUGHT UP OKAY

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:03.135
AND I APPRECIATE THAT I'M GONNA

01:59:03.202 --> 01:59:05.805
GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF A

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:09.342
RECENTLY PASSED BILL- AB EIGHT

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:10.877
FORTY ONE. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:13.246
ANALYST WITH THAT IS THAT THE

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:15.715
ESTIMATED TOTAL FISCAL IMPACT

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:17.116
FOR ADDITIONAL STAFFING COSTS

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:19.986
FOR CARD NCPC THE EMPLOYMENT THE

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:22.021
BILL THIS IS ABOUT SCHOOL ENERGY

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:24.323
EFFICIENCY WITH LEFT A MILLION

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:25.758
DOLLARS. NO THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.793
THOUGHT AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.629
LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS I

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:30.196
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:31.831
SAYING OKAY THAT DOESN'T SOUND

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:34.400
LIKE TOO MUCH. BUT YOU DID NOT

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:35.868
SEE THAT SENSE BUT BILL WITH

01:59:35.935 --> 01:59:38.437
IMPLEMENTED THE ACTUAL COST TO

01:59:38.504 --> 01:59:41.140
RATEPAYERS HAS BEEN SEVEN

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:44.310
HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:44.944
DOLLARS. THE FORMER FOR UNDER

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:47.947
MILLION MY RECORD. IS THAT THIS

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:50.850
COMMITTEE REQUIRE THE THREE PS

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:52.885
THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENTAL

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:55.388
AFFAIRS OR UNITED THEY CAN PASS

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:58.124
IT ALONG BUT YOU ASK THEM TO DO

01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:01.627
A RATEPAYER. IMPACT ANALYSIS ON

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:03.829
ALL BILLS THAT MAY HAVE A RATE

02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:05.731
SO THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:07.967
IN FRONT OF YOU YOU NEED IT'S

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:09.835
CRITICAL FOR YOU TO HAVE

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:11.604
COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.339
RATEPAYER IMPACT. SO THAT YOU

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:15.841
CAN STOP. ADOPTING RATE

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.410
INCREASES WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.211
WHICH IS WHAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.880
HAS BEEN HAPPENING YOU NEED THE

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:23.749
INFORMATION THERE THE WAY THEY

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:25.985
GET IT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:27.653
DIRECTLY FROM THE P. THREE. AND

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:28.220
I DON'T THINK LEGISLATIVE-

02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:29.055
ANALYSTS OFFICE HAVETHE

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:33.726
RESOURCES TO DO THAT MY FINAL

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.261
COMMENT IS. RAVING THE RATES OF

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:39.098
ELECTRICITY TWO HIGH UNDERMINE

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:42.501
CALIFORNIA CLIMATE GOALS BECAUSE

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.370
IT'S A DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:45.805
TO WANT TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:48.808
VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC APPLIANCES

02:00:48.874 --> 02:00:51.811
IF THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS

02:00:51.877 --> 02:00:54.213
MORE THAN THE COST OF FOSSIL

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.382
FUELS IF WE REALLY WANT TO

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:57.817
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SWITCH TO

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.986
ELECTRICITY WE OUGHT TO BE

02:01:00.052 --> 02:01:01.687
TALKING ABOUT CUTTING THE COST

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.589
OF ELECTRICITY BY HALF I'M

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:06.225
TELLING YOU IF WE COULD FIGURE

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:08.094
OUT A WAY TO DO. THAT PEOPLE

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.395
WOULD RUSH SHE SWITCHED

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:11.797
ELECTRICITY RIGHT NOW A LOT OF

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.032
PEOPLE ARE HAVING SECOND

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:14.367
THOUGHTS THAT CONFERS WITH

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:16.168
GREATLY THANK YOU I'M OPEN TO

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:18.037

THANK YOU YOU SOUND LIKE A VERY

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.609
PASSIONATE UTILITY ADVOCATE-

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:25.211
RIGHT PAYER ADVOCATE- AND LET ME

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:26.912

FACULTY SAID I'VE JUST. I DON'T

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:34.720
KNOW ABOUT OPEN IT UP FOR

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:36.055
QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:39.325
MEMBERS MR I'M A REPORT. GOOD TO

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:43.763
SEE MARK- FIFTY FIRST OF ALL I

02:01:43.829 --> 02:01:45.998
DO AGREE IF WE COULD- CUT THE

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:49.669
RATE IN HALF THAT WE WOULD GET A

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:52.705
LOT MORE- AS A PATIENT WE GET A

02:01:52.772 --> 02:01:55.174
LOT MORE- PEOPLE WANTING TO GO

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:58.277
ELECTRIC THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:02.415
MIND- AND- CERTAINLY. MOST YEARS

02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:04.350
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY IN THE

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:06.719
GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR WE DO-

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:08.187
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD

02:02:08.254 --> 02:02:12.892
CONSIDER- IS USING GENERAL FUND

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:15.961
MONEY FOR. THINGS THAT PROMOTE

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:18.864
OUR CLIMATE GOALS OF RATHER THAN

02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:20.933
RATEPAYER MONEY I AND I THINK

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.034
THAT MAKES SOME SENSE WHAT I'M

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:24.637
CONCERNED ABOUT THOUGH IS YOU'RE

02:02:24.704 --> 02:02:26.872
TALKING ABOUT THE RATE. ARE

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:29.875
HAVING ESSENTIALLY THE C. P. U.

02:02:29.942 --> 02:02:31.811
C. TECA. A CLOSER LOOK AT THE

02:02:31.877 --> 02:02:34.080
RATES WHICH IS FINE BUT TO

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:36.382
LIMITED TO INFLATION LET'S FACE

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:39.518
IT. RIGHT NOW WILL WHILE FIRING

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.787
MITIGATION IS A BIG COST FOR

02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:44.790
PG&amp;E ARE WE GONNA TELL THEM UP

02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:46.158
SORRY YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:47.960
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE

02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:49.895
RATE INCREASE OR SOMETHING ELSE.

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:55.668
SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WHAT IS ITTHAT THE FUTILITY IS DON'T DO.

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.570
THAT THEY MIGHT DO IF YOU

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.105
ALLOWED THAN THAT LARGER RATE

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:01.073
INCREASE AND I CERTAINLY AGREE

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.708
WE SHOULD LOOK AT EVERYTHING

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:05.478
THAT'S BEING DONE. BUT HOW DO WE

02:03:05.544 --> 02:03:08.481
KNOW HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE. WHAT

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:09.815
IS IT YOU THINK THAT THEY MIGHT

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.884
BE DOING THAT THEY CAN'T DO I

02:03:11.951 --> 02:03:13.619
GUESS THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION.

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:14.954
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT I

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:17.490
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IT'S A

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:20.526
FAIR QUESTION. THERE THERE ARE A

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:24.029
COUPLE OF RESPONSES ONE IS THAT.

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:26.031
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:30.236
RECENTLY RELEASED- CLIMATE PLAN

02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:34.106
ZERO- 100% CLEAN ENERGY CLIMATE

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:36.075
PLAN THAT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:39.478
BY MUD. THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL

02:03:39.545 --> 02:03:41.614
UTILITY DISTRICT. THEY HAVE A

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.481
COMMITMENT TO REACHING THEIR

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:46.986
GOALS AND- STAYING WITHIN-

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:49.989
INFLATION IN TERMS OF- OF

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:53.425
INCREASES SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE

02:03:53.492 --> 02:03:55.628
THAT OF THE OF THE QUICK POINT.

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:57.997
I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT. THE

02:03:58.063 --> 02:04:00.399
UTILITIES CAN'T DO IT ALONE I DO

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:02.501
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND I

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:03.869
THINK PARTICULARLY WITH BOB FIRE

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:08.607
COUGH PART OF MY POINT IS THAT.

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:09.742
THE EMISSIONS CAUSED BY

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:13.245
WILDFIRES REALLY DRAG US BACK

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:14.847
THE WHOLE STATE BACK ALL THE

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:17.116
MONEY WE SPEND IT DRAGS US BACK

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.318
WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING OUR

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:20.286
CLIMATE GOALS AND OFF OUR PUBLIC

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:21.954
HEALTH GOAL FOR I THINK THAT

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:25.090
THERE IS. A CASE TO BE MADE

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:28.761
THAT- SOME OF THE WILDFIRE

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:32.565
COUGH- AND ALSO BECAUSE WE NEED

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:33.732
TO DO IT QUICKLY OKAY WE JUST

02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:35.768
CAN'T WAIT FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:37.369
THAT THERE THIS IS THE TYPE OF

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:39.071
EXTRAORDINARY ONCE IN A

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:41.674
GENERATION URGENT COSTS THAT I

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:43.976
AM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IF

02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:45.644
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:47.279
I AM FROM COLLEAGUES THAT ARE

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:48.948
WONDERING ABOUT SHOULD WE PUT

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:52.985
THE CARE PROGRAM ON. THE STATE

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:54.887
BUDGET I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:04:54.954 --> 02:04:56.055
THAT I'M JUST BUT I'M JUST

02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:58.090
LETTING YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T

02:04:58.157 --> 02:05:00.392
THINK THAT SUCH A GREAT IDEA

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:02.294
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:04.363
STATE SURPLUS I KNOW THAT FROM

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:06.899
BEING. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A

02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:08.467
SURPLUS BE INVESTED IN SOMETHING

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:10.703
THAT PAYS OFF OVER A GENERATION

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:13.505
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THESE

02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:14.340
WILDFIRE MITIGATION WE'RE

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:17.343
TALKING ABOUT WILL PAY OFF FOR

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:19.879
GENERATIONS THAT I. I THINK THAT

02:05:19.945 --> 02:05:21.847
PART OF IT IS THAT YOU'RE RIGHT

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:23.682
SOME STUFF UTILITIES WON'T BE

02:05:23.749 --> 02:05:26.385
ABLE TO DO BUT THAT BACK FROM

02:05:26.452 --> 02:05:28.921
WHERE WE NEED MORE COORDINATION

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:34.827
AND PARTNERSHIP NOW MY GUESS IS. THAT THE STATE BUDGET. BEING

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.695
LARGER THE WE HAD. GOES AWAY

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:37.763
PRETTY QUICKLY BUT I AM THRILLED

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:40.432
WITH YOU. I JUST I'M NOT SURE

02:05:40.499 --> 02:05:42.468
THAT'S A SOLUTION BUT IF WE

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:44.837
COULD IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA THANK

02:05:44.904 --> 02:05:46.872
YOU. THANK YOU. THINGS WERE

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:49.008
GOING TO MY RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:50.910
FROM ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES.

02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:56.015
MISTER MURPHY G. ALL RIGHT-

02:05:56.081 --> 02:06:00.619
WELCOME MR TONY- FIRST OF ALL I

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:04.223
. I'M GOOD AT- YOU SIERRA HERE

02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:06.158
HERE HERE OPENING PHRASE MOST

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:09.028
GREEN FOR LEASE SCREEN I THINK

02:06:09.094 --> 02:06:10.129
WE CAN ALL COULD APPRECIATE THAT

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:14.033
BUT- BUT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.267
AT AND WHEN WE START GETTING

02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:17.736
INTO A- DID IT TO SOME OF THE-

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:18.938
THE ENGINE TO GETTING INTO THE

02:06:19.004 --> 02:06:20.639
WEEDS I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:22.541
GETS MORE COMPLICATED LIKE. LIKE

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:23.375
FOR EXAMPLE YOUR YOUR YOUR THIRD

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:28.247
PROPOSAL- POINT OF SALE- YOU

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:33.319
KNOW YOU COSTS ARE YEAH I MEAN.

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:35.688
I THINK I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:37.957
TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT- YOU KNOW

02:06:38.023 --> 02:06:40.292
ME ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE

02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:43.228
A TAX ON GAS POWERED CARS RIGHT

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:46.365
YEAH BUT BUT THAT WOULD GO TO

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:49.268
THE ECONOMIC REALITY THAT- MISS

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:51.303
CARDIO WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:53.772
ABOUT. YOU KNOW. FOR MOST

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:56.308
WORKING FOLKS. THEY CAN'T AFFORD

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:59.178
ELECTRIC CAR AND SO YOU KNOW

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:00.412
THAT'S GOING TO BE A HIGHER TAX

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:03.716
ON. ON WORKING FOLKS DRIVING GAS

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:06.285
CARS AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.754
FOLKS DRIVING TESLAS MAN HAVE

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:11.623
HAD HOW DO YOU IT SEEMS LIKE A-

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:13.425
YEAH IT'S IT SEEMS CONTRADICTORY

02:07:13.492 --> 02:07:14.760
ON THE ON THE ONE HAND YOUR YOUR

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:17.029
AIR ADVOCATING FOR- YOU KNOW

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:21.066
MORE MORE AFFORDABLE- UTILITY

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:24.336
RATES- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND-

02:07:24.403 --> 02:07:26.605
OVER INCREASING COSTS IS FOR. IN

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.974
IN IN IN WAYS THAT THEY THAT

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:31.643
THAT WOULD IMPACT WORKING CLASS

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:33.445
FOLKS THE MOST. THANK YOU FOR

02:07:33.512 --> 02:07:34.680
ASKING BETTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:37.883
MURATSUCHI SO LET ME GO BACK TO

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:39.485
MY EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT I'M TALKING

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:40.819
ABOUT NEW VEHICLES IN THE FERRET

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:44.923
OUT WITH NOT USED VEHICLES. SO

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:47.192
THE FACT IS THAT FIFTY THOUSAND

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:50.095
DOLLARS IF THE AVERAGE COST OF A

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.865
NEW VEHICLE. AND I'M TALKING

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.667
ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:58.103
TACKED ON THE IDEA IS THAT A

02:07:58.170 --> 02:08:00.873
COMPARABLE ELECTRIC CART WHAT

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:03.475
WHAT IF YOU COULD MAKE THE

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:04.777
ELECTRIC CAR FORTY THOUSAND THE

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:06.078
COMPARABLE OR THIRTY THOUSAND

02:08:06.145 --> 02:08:09.314
OKAY NOW. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:11.316
IS MAKING IT ECONOMICALLY

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:14.319
VIABLE. THE OTHER THING IS THAT

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:16.055
THE COST OF MAINTAINING AN

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:19.391
ELECTRIC CAR HE FELL FAR BELOW

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:21.960
GASOLINE CAR I MEAN I'M TELLING

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:23.595
YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IT'S

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:26.832
VIRTUALLY NOTHING AND SO I WOULD

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:30.102
SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE I

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.837
UNDERSTAND THE FEARS THAT PEOPLE

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:33.972
HAVE. BUT I WILL SAY AS AN

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:37.342
ELECTRIC CAR DRIVER THE COST THE

02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:39.778
ONGOING MONTHLY COSTS ARE FAR

02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:42.247
LOWER SO I BELIEVE THAT IF WE

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:44.917
CAN REDUCE THE COST OF ELECTRIC

02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:48.020
VEHICLE TO BE LOW THE COST OF A

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:50.889
GASOLINE VEHICLE. AND THEN WHAT

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:54.460
THE COST OF OWNERSHIP OF AWFUL

02:08:54.526 --> 02:08:57.029
LOWER. BUT THAT HELPS WORKING

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.597
FAMILIES. IF I LOOK AT IT.

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:00.466
PARAPET YEAH THANK GUESS THE

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:03.068
CHALLENGE WOULD BE. WELL I CAN

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:04.837
SEE A LOT OF CHALLENGES BUT- I

02:09:04.903 --> 02:09:06.705
GET YOUR POINT I AND I AND I

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:08.807
APPRECIATE YOUR POINT BUT BRING

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:10.976
IT BACK TO- ELECTRIC RATES IN AN

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:16.115
AWAY FROM FROM FROM FROM CARS-

02:09:16.181 --> 02:09:17.282
YOUR YOUR YOUR FIRST PROPOSAL

02:09:17.349 --> 02:09:19.551
ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW. HOW WE

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:20.752
SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:21.854
MITIGATIONS LIKE BUILDING

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.523
ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION THROUGH

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:28.827
NON RATE PAIR- APPROACHES IN AND

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:31.763
THEN YOU MENTIONED. I IT WASN'T

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.132
EVEN AWARE THIS THING I PROBABLY

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:35.234
SHOULD BE BETTER. SO OUR RATE

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:39.738
PAYERS BEING CHARGED FOR. FOUR

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:41.807
BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. THERE

02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:44.543
IS A CURRENT PROPOSAL THAT HAS

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.078
BEEN SUBMITTED BY SOUTHERN

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:49.615
CALIFORNIA EDISON. TO ELECTRIFY

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:52.885
TEN THOUSAND HOMES. FOR THE COST

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:56.155
OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:58.991
BILLION RATEPAYER DOLLARS. NOT

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:03.228
NOT. HERE'S THE THING. OF ALL

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.696
THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA THERE

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:08.000
ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION UNITS. IT

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:12.171
PRODUCES- 7% OF ALL CARBON

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:13.939
EMISSIONS COME FROM RESIDENTIAL

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:16.041
WHAT THAT MEANS BASICALLY IF IN

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:18.810
ORDER TO HAVE A 1% REDUCTION YOU

02:10:18.877 --> 02:10:20.145
NEED TO MILLION HOMES TO BE

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:23.649
ELECTRIFIED. AND YOU KNOW YOU

02:10:23.715 --> 02:10:25.918
KNOW I'M LOOKING AT YOU CAN

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:28.187
EITHER HAVE TO GO BIG OR GO HOME

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:29.354
WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING

02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:30.756
ELECTRIFICATION TEN THOUSAND

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:33.992
HOME FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:36.495
DOLLARS. TO TEN THOUSAND IT

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:37.095
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO MOVE

02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:39.498
THE NEEDLE- THAT THE PROPOSAL

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:42.467
WE'VE BEEN FLOATING. IS WHAT IF

02:10:42.534 --> 02:10:45.938
YOU REQUIRED AS A CONDITION. OF

02:10:46.004 --> 02:10:48.340
CLOTHING OFF GROW. ON THE FINGER

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:51.410
FAMILY HOME. THAT COULD BE

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:54.947
CONVERTED TO ELECTRIC HOT WATER

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:58.150
. COOKING AND EATING OTHER

02:10:58.217 --> 02:10:59.218
THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:01.353
HOMES A YEAR THAT SINGLE FAMILY

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:03.121
RESIDENTIAL HOMES THAT ARE FULL

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:05.057
IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT BUT THAT

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:06.758
AGAIN YOU KNOWWITH THE SIMILAR

02:11:06.825 --> 02:11:08.594
TO THE GAS POWERED THE TAX ON

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.963
THE GAS CARS IT WOULD ADD TO THE

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:12.965
AFFORDABILITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:15.934
CRISIS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:19.404
OF LOOKING AT IT I WILL SAY THAT

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:21.974
. FINANCE THE ABILITY TO

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.611
FINANCE. THAT CONVERSION AT

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.613
MORTGAGE RATES WHICH IS ABOUT

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:29.481
THE LOWEST KIND OF RATES THAT

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:31.516
MOST EVERYDAY CONSUMERS HAVE

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:35.487
AVAILABLE TO THEM. IT IT IT.

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:37.022
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BY

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:39.992
ANY MEANS WHAT IT IS IT'S A BIG

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:44.763
SOLUTION IF THE GOAL BIG CONCEPT

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:45.998
. THE REASON I'M PUTTING THAT ON

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:47.666
THE TABLE IF WE DON'T HAVE

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:49.368
ENOUGH GO BIG FAT WHAT I'M

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.136
HOPING IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:54.072
LIKE. TURNS GO BIG CONCEPT TO

02:11:54.139 --> 02:11:57.042
COME UP WITH THEIR OWN GO TO BE

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:58.010
CONCEPT SO I'LL BE HONEST WITH

02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:59.911
YOU. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:02.914
BURN. WITHOUT IT'S NOT THAT WE

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:05.817
THINK IT'S EASY. TO GET ADOPTED

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:07.419
OR WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:09.955
BUT- WE NEED BIG IDEAS ON THE

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:13.859
TABLE HERE'S OUR FONG. AND LAST

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:16.728
TO- YOUR YOUR POINT THAT CLEAN

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:18.730
ENERGY MANDATE SHOULDN'T IMPACT

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:21.833
THE RATE PAYERS. BUT I MEAN YOU

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.869
WOULD YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT- THAT

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.771
THIS IS YOU KNOW INTERNALIZING

02:12:25.837 --> 02:12:27.372
COSTS CAN BE DIFFICULT LIKE HOW

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:29.041
DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE

02:12:29.107 --> 02:12:30.909
INTERNALIZE THE COSTS YOU KNOW.

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:34.513
OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF-

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:36.481
OF EVER INCREASING WORLDWIDE

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:39.318
FIRE COSTS YOU KNOW PUBLIC

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:43.455
HEALTH COSTS OF YOU KNOW THE ALL

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:46.024
THE- SMOKE- THAT THAT THAT OUR

02:12:46.091 --> 02:12:48.060
KIDS ARE BREATHING AND FROM FROM

02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:49.895
ALL THE WILD FIRES ME IT'S NOT

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:52.064
JUST RATEPAYER. IMPACT ANALYSIS

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:54.700
RATE I MEAN WE ALSO NEED TO

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:57.269
CONSIDER- THAT THE COSTS OF

02:12:57.336 --> 02:12:59.671
CLIMATE CHANGE- ABSOLUTELY WHAT

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:00.972
WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:03.108
RATEPAYERS HAVE ALREADY INVESTED

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:07.646
BILLIONS IN DECARBONISING. THE

02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:10.882
THE GENERATION. IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:12.684
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.119
COMES TO BUILDING.

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:15.754
DECARBONIZATION AND

02:13:15.821 --> 02:13:17.856
TRANSPORTATION THAT THE

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.091
TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:21.360
FACTOR PITCH IN AND PAY THEIR

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:23.462
FAIR SHARE OF REVENUE WHEN WE'RE

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:25.630
TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT IS EXACTLY

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.232
BECAUSE OF THE REASON THAT

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.668
WILDFIRES IMPACT FAR MORE THAN

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:31.436
RATE PAYERS. THAT WE BELIEVE IT

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:34.773
IS JUSTIFIABLE TO LOOK FOR

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:37.909
REVENUE FROM OTHER FACTORS TO

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.344
COMPLEMENT WHAT RAPIER FOR

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:41.480
PAYING. THAT'S THE BASIC

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:43.815
PRINCIPLE. I THANK YOU. THANK

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.217
YOU QUESTIONS FROM SOME MEMBERS

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:46.952
OF THAT YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.321
WHEN I CAN ADD ON TO THE CONSENT

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:49.788
CALENDAR WOULD BE MUCH

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.022
APPRECIATED ONCE AGAIN RECESSED.

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:52.724
FOR THE HEARING IN A MINUTE AND

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:53.792
NOT APPRECIATE THEM THANK YOU

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.228
AND I DON'T AND I WANT TO

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:56.895
APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING IN TERMS

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:58.997
OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO.

02:13:59.064 --> 02:13:59.831
HELP PREPARE THE TICKLING THOSE

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:02.234
WHO ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST IN

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:04.536
THE AND I'VE SEEN SOME OF YOUR

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:05.203
ADVOCACY OVER THE YEARS AND I'VE

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:06.738
LEARNED TO APPRECIATE QUITE A

02:14:06.805 --> 02:14:08.573
BIT. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:09.941
ON IT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:12.744
BETWEEN OFFICE IN YOUR OFFICE.

02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.246
I'M FROM THE PUBLIC PURPOSE PRO.

02:14:14.312 --> 02:14:15.914
IS THE ONE. OF THOUGHT IS THAT.

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:17.883
CONTROLS ABOUT BILLS IN A IN A

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.984
HEARING ONE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IS

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.218
THAT- IS WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING

02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:21.920
WHICH IS. WE FIND ANOTHER SOURCE

02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:24.723
OF INCOME- I'M USING THAT. WORD

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:27.859
LOOSELY INCOME- ANOTHER SCHOOL

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:29.861
OF THOUGHT IS THAT WE USE A

02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:31.630
STATE REVENUE THE STATE

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:34.699
REVENUES- OR- SURPLUSES THAT- IN

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:37.869
ORDER TO. ALLEVIATE A RATEPAYER.

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.671
N. AND YOU KNOW THE STRUGGLE IS

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.139
YOU KNOW WHICH REPAIRS TO PAY

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.741
WHICH ONES. SHOULD PAY FOR WHAT

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:44.075
SERVICES AND FOR WHO AND OFTEN

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:46.578
TIMES. WHEN WE HAVE THESE

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:47.846
CONVERSATIONS. IT IS ONE GROUP

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:49.181
OF RATEPAYERS WHO. BURDEN THIS

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:51.016
THE MOST AND IN MANY CASES. ARE

02:14:51.082 --> 02:14:52.517
THOSE WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:54.686
ECONOMICALLY BURDENED THIS THE

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:57.656
MOST. FOR THE GREATER GOOD. OUT

02:14:57.722 --> 02:14:59.858
WITH A PUSH YOU A LITTLE BIT ON

02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:00.926
ON ON A COUPLE OF THOSE CONTENT

02:15:00.992 --> 02:15:02.894
HERE. I THINK OUR CULTURE. HAVE

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:07.833
PUSHED BUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. TO PUSH BECAUSE- IF IT'S-

02:15:07.899 --> 02:15:09.234
THIS. REVENUE IS ONE WHETHER WE

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.969
JUST IT AS A SO TODAY OR WOULD

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.938
WE DESCRIBED AS ON. REVENUE AND

02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:14.606
I HEAR YOUR CAUTION I THINK

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:17.309
IT'S- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU

02:15:17.375 --> 02:15:18.810
HAD SAID THAT. IF THERE IS A DIP

02:15:18.877 --> 02:15:20.145
IN STATE REVENUES WILL THEN WHAT

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:21.880
HAPPENS IF PROGRAMS AT THAT I

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:24.649
GET THAT. BUT ON THE PUSH A

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:25.784
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE STATE

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:27.986
REVENUES. A PIECE OF IT- AND IF

02:15:28.053 --> 02:15:31.356
YOU'RE IF YOU'RE- IN PAIN WHEN

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:33.291
WE WHEN YOU GO BACK INTO- LIKE

02:15:33.358 --> 02:15:34.793
MY COLLEAGUE AND- HAD A QUESTION

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:38.697
YOU WALKED INTO- THESE- OTHER.

02:15:38.763 --> 02:15:42.334
THE AREAS WHERE WE CAN INCREASE.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:44.703
OUR REVENUE FORTY SAID PROGRAMS

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:46.705
. THE GOAL OF GOING TO A STATE

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:49.274
REVENUE AT LEAST FOR ME WOULD BE

VIEW WITH THE STATE AUDIT SHOWS

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:12.156
. IS THAT WHEN YOU WHAT HAS

02:22:12.223 --> 02:22:16.294
HAPPENED IS THAT BETWEEN THE

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:18.129
WHAT THE PHILIPPINES IS DOING

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:19.898
AND WHAT THE OPETH OF ENERGY

02:22:19.964 --> 02:22:22.667
FIFTIES DOING. REPAIRS ON THE

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:24.903

BEEN CUT OUT OF THE FIFTY

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:38.850
CERTIFICATE- WE'RE NOT PART OF

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:40.585
THAT PROCESS INTERVENOR

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.687
COMPENSATION WITH A WAS

02:22:42.754 --> 02:22:46.724
ELIMINATED FROM THAT FROM THAT

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:49.193
PROPOSAL- THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:51.963
BE. THE PROPER MITIGATION PLAN

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:55.066
WITH OPPOSED TO- BE COVERED

02:22:55.133 --> 02:22:57.135
UNDER INTERVENOR COMPENSATION

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:59.537
ANOTHER THREE PCS ST WHAT WE

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:02.473
DON'T THINK SO WE DON'T THINK

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:07.712
IT'S COVERED. THE CPSC. WHEN IT

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:11.049
INVESTIGATED. THE CAUSE OF

02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:14.018
WILDFIRES UTILITY INVOLVEMENT IN

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:16.087
WILDFIRES THEY USED TO

02:23:16.154 --> 02:23:19.490
INVESTIGATE IT AND THEN INVITE

02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:22.527
PARTY FLIGHT TURNED AND OTHER

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:23.995
INTERESTED PARTIES ARE MULTI

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:25.830
GRADE ROAD ALLIANCE FORINSTANCE

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:28.866
I DEFEND THE A GO TO PARTICIPATE

02:23:28.933 --> 02:23:30.234
IN THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE

02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:32.637
NEGOTIATIONS WELL THIS YEAR FOR

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:35.273
THE KINCAID FIRE FOR PG&amp;E AND

02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:36.741
THE THOMAS FIRE FOR THE

02:23:36.808 --> 02:23:39.210
CALIFORNIA EDISON IT WAS ALL

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:41.512

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:45.650
TRANSPARENCY. AND IT WAS A BACK

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:48.486
ROOM DEAL TURN IS CRITICIZED THE

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:51.122
PC ROUNDLY FOR THIS SO I THINK

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:52.924
PART OF IT IS THAT IF YOU WANT

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.892
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY YOU CAN'T

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:57.528
KEEP GROUPS LIKE TURN YOU CAN'T

02:23:57.595 --> 02:24:00.431
KEEP OUR EXPERTS OUT OF THE ROOM

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:02.300
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU MAY

02:24:02.367 --> 02:24:05.503
WANT OF GROUPS TO BE IN THE ROOM

02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:08.573
SO THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:10.308
UTILITY NEGOTIATING WITH THE

02:24:10.375 --> 02:24:14.679

02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:22.520
LIKE IF YOU HELP ME OTHER

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:25.056
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AT THE C. P.

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.424
U. C. THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:28.292
IN THERE AB SIXTY SEVEN REPORT-

02:24:28.359 --> 02:24:31.095
LOOKING AT- HOW STATE.

INTERVENES INVESTS SUBSIDIZES-

02:24:35.166 --> 02:24:36.300
WHATEVER TERMINOLOGY WE WANT TO

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:39.737
USE- BUT IS THERE- SOMETHING

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:41.139
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:43.074
WE'VE HONED IN ON MA'AM ARE

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:45.443

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:47.645
NAME PROGRAM. WE ALL BE TAKING A

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:51.249
LOOK AT IT IN IN GENERAL. I

02:24:51.315 --> 02:24:52.583
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:55.753
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SHOULD

02:24:55.820 --> 02:25:00.291
BE SHOULD RATEPAYER. BE PAYING

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:01.592
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:04.028
STATIONS ON THEIR BILL SHOULD BE

02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:06.431
PAYING SHOULD THEY BE PAYING FOR

02:25:06.497 --> 02:25:08.066
THE CONVERSION OF LIGHT AND

02:25:08.132 --> 02:25:10.501
MEDIUM DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES

02:25:10.568 --> 02:25:12.937
ON THEIR MONTHLY BILLS SHOULDN'T

02:25:13.004 --> 02:25:16.274
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BE BE

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.477
PAYING FOR THAT- I THINK THERE'S

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:23.748
A WHOLE LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT

02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:26.117
RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:28.920
WOULD BE BETTER PAID THROUGH

02:25:28.986 --> 02:25:31.722
OTHER PROGRAMS WE HAVE-

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:35.893

DOING RESEARCH ON A BIG HYDROGEN

02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:41.466
PROJECT AND THERE IS MONEY FROM

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:45.069
THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DO THAT

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:48.206
SO THERE ARE A LOT. A NUMBER OF

02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:50.675
PROGRAMS THAT WE AND I CAN

. HOPING THAT. YOU ALL CAN SEE

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.529
THIS I THINK WE CAN I'M OFF

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:53.664
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:54.232
INVITING ME TO. ISN'T THIS

02:27:54.298 --> 02:27:58.536
AFTERNOON IT'S A REAL HONOR- I

02:27:58.603 --> 02:28:00.638
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO START

02:28:00.705 --> 02:28:05.076
OFF TO SAY. WE ARE IN VERY

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:06.744
UNUSUAL TIMES WHEN IT COMES TO

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:08.246
INFLATION CUSTOMERS ARE

02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:10.648
SUFFERING WE KNOW THIS AND SO

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:12.216
ANYTHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:14.485
DO TO HELP WITH BILL RELIEF TO

02:28:14.552 --> 02:28:16.187
HELP CUSTOMERS FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:17.922
DO THIS ENERGY TRANSITION IN A

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:20.091
WAY THAT PRESERVES DIGNITY FOR

02:28:20.157 --> 02:28:21.025
THEM FOR THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:23.828
FAMILIES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:24.929
I THINK THAT WAS GETTING MISS

02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:26.964
FROM PART OF THE CONVERSATION

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:27.832
THAT I WAS HEARING EARLIER TODAY

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:30.001
SO I WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:33.004
THAT WAS EMPHASIZED- MY GOAL

02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:34.572
HERE WAS NOT TO TALK ABOUT ANY

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:35.773
ONE SPECIFIC BILL THAT'S

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:36.841
CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:39.410
LEGISLATURE. BUT TO OFFER UP

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:40.645
SOME IDEAS OF THINGS THAT THIS

02:28:40.711 --> 02:28:42.280
COMMITTEE COULD DO EITHER THE

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:43.781
SESSION ON THE FUTURE AND I

02:28:43.848 --> 02:28:45.783
STAND READY TO HELP. BRAINSTORM

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:48.286
WITH ANY AND ALL OF YOU AS MUCH

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:51.722
AS I CAN- THE FIRST QUESTION I'D

02:28:51.789 --> 02:28:53.491
LIKE TO OFFER UP IS YOU HAVE

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:56.427
THIS BUT HEARING IS ABOUT RATES

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:57.662
AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

02:28:57.728 --> 02:29:00.331
BUT I'D LIKE TO PUSH ON THAT

02:29:00.398 --> 02:29:02.266
QUESTION FOR A MOMENT WHY ARE WE

02:29:02.333 --> 02:29:03.601
FOCUSING ON RATES. AS SIMON

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:04.802
BAKER SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF

02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:07.705
HIS PRESENTATION RATES ARE THE

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:09.040
HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY FOR

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:11.075
CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO HAS SOME OF

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.810
THE HIGHEST ELECTRIC RATES

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:14.178
ANYWHERE. BUT RATES IS ONE

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:16.647
METRIC- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:29:16.714 --> 02:29:17.948
MURATSUCHI TALKED ABOUT THE RATE

02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:20.284
SOURCES BILLS PART OF IT BUT I

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:21.719
ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO GO A

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:23.888
STEP FURTHER THAN THAT- AND I'M

02:29:23.954 --> 02:29:25.523
GOING TO SUGGEST SOME IDEAS

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:26.924
DURING THIS PRESENTATION OF THE

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:28.626
OF MAY BE A BETTER METRIC PRESS

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:31.996
TO BE THINKING ABOUT- I DO WANT

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:34.131
TO NOTE AT THE SAME TIME THAT

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:35.733
THE LEGISLATURE AS GIVEN US

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:36.600
SOME DIRECTION. AS A STATE

02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:38.636
SAYING WE WANT TO DECARBONIZE

02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:40.671
THE ECONOMY AND WE WANT TO DO

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:43.174
THAT ON. THE U. USING LEVERAGE

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:45.176
OF THE STATE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:47.111
TO DO THAT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:49.313
A RATE VERSUS BILL INTACT WELL

02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:50.881
RATES ARE HIGH BUT USAGE IS

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.216
LOWER BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:53.651
TALKING ABOUT INCREASING USAGE.

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:54.685
BUT THAT'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR

02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:56.354
SOMETHING ELSE SO WE NEED TO

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:57.788
THINK ABOUT WELL WHAT IF THAT

02:29:57.855 --> 02:29:58.656
SUBSTITUTION EFFECT AND IT'S

02:29:58.723 --> 02:30:01.359
GOING TO REQUIRE US TO WHITE IN

02:30:01.425 --> 02:30:02.526
THAT LENDS A LITTLE BIT. AND SO

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:04.628
RATES ARE GONNA GO OUT. THERE

02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:06.063
ARE WAYS TO CONTAIN THAT USAGE

02:30:06.130 --> 02:30:08.599
IS GOING TO GO UP THERE WAYS TO

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:09.233
CONTAIN NINE BUT OTHER THINGS

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:13.337
ARE GOING TO GO DOWN AND WE NEED

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:15.206
TO BE THINKING THROUGH THAT. SO

02:30:15.272 --> 02:30:17.074
MY FIRST GO BOLDER STATEMENT

02:30:17.141 --> 02:30:17.942
THAT I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:19.944
THIS COMMITTEE IS LET'S NOT

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:20.778
FOCUS ON RATES AND LET'S NOT

02:30:20.845 --> 02:30:22.947
FOCUS ON RATES AND BILLS LET'S

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:25.149
FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS AND HOW WE

02:30:25.216 --> 02:30:27.551
CAN HELP THEM WITH THEIR ENERGY

02:30:27.618 --> 02:30:32.189
BURDEN- ENERGY BURDEN ITSELF IS

02:30:32.256 --> 02:30:34.325
A TERM OF ART. THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:36.227
ENERGY TALKS ABOUT IT AS THE

02:30:36.293 --> 02:30:37.361
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OVERALL

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:39.530
INCOME THAT YOU SPEND ON YOUR

02:30:39.597 --> 02:30:42.400
TOTAL ENERGY BILL. AND I WOULD

02:30:42.466 --> 02:30:44.034
POSIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:45.169
COMMITTEE THAT WE SHOULD THINK

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:47.371
ABOUT THIS AS HOLISTICALLY AS WE

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.707
CAN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. WHAT WE

02:30:49.774 --> 02:30:51.108
PLUG IN TO CHARGE YOUR IPHONE

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:53.077
THAT ITS THE- THE GAS THAT GOES

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:55.212
INTO OUR CAR IT'S ABOUT THE GAS

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:57.014
IT'S USING TO POWER HOMES THE

02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:58.983
PROPANE TANKS ARE- EVERYTHING

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:01.252
ELSE THE ENTIRE ENERGY BURDEN

02:31:01.318 --> 02:31:03.053
HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE SPENDING

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.523
THEIR- LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ON

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.992
AVERAGE SPEND THREE TIMES MORE.

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:10.394
OF AN ENERGY BURDEN THAN OTHER

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:13.597
CUSTOMERS TO. THAT'S A REALLY

02:31:13.664 --> 02:31:15.433
HIGH NUMBER WE NEED TO THINK

02:31:15.499 --> 02:31:20.304
THROUGH THAT. AND OF COURSE AND

02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:24.642
I ALSO JUST OBSERVE THAT. I HOPE

02:31:24.708 --> 02:31:25.810
IT WASN'T SOMETHING I SAID YOU

02:31:25.876 --> 02:31:33.918
KNOW WHAT. I ALSO OBSERVE JUST

02:31:33.984 --> 02:31:35.953
AS WE THINK ABOUT ENERGY BURDEN

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:37.588
AS A METRIC THAT CALIFORNIANS

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:40.291
HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

02:31:40.357 --> 02:31:41.992
THE WORLD AND ONE THIRD OF OUR

02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:43.527
CITIZENS CANNOT AFFORD THEIR

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:45.229
ENERGY BILL TODAY WE KNOW THAT

02:31:45.296 --> 02:31:47.097
AND SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING

02:31:47.164 --> 02:31:47.932
ABOUT HOW DO WE ADOPT THIS

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:49.600
METRIC NOT JUST FOR CARE

02:31:49.667 --> 02:31:51.368
CUSTOMERS BUT HOW DO WE THINK

02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:53.037
ABOUT IT KIND OF. GOING FORWARD

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:55.139
. SO MY QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.041
IF WE USE ENERGY BURDEN AS A

02:31:57.107 --> 02:31:58.576
METRIC WE COULD DESIGN THAT WE

02:31:58.642 --> 02:32:00.511
COULD THINK ABOUT IT. AS I THINK

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.046
YOU MIGHT HEAR MISCAST AS TALK

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:03.547
ABOUT IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:04.849
ALSO. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.417
AVERAGE CUSTOMER BUT WE'RE GONNA

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:08.285
HAVE TO DIVIDE DESIGNED THIS TO

02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:10.454
BE FOR COHORTS OF CUSTOMERS. THE

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:11.989
MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS THEIR

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.891
ENERGY BURDEN IS SO MUCH

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:16.060
DIFFERENT THAN. MEDIAN INCOME

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:17.528
HOUSEHOLD IN A WEALTHY HOUSE ON

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:19.697
HOUSEHOLD INCOME EXCUSE ME. THAN

02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:21.565
A CUT SMALL BUSINESS EXCEPT OURS

02:32:21.632 --> 02:32:23.133
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEGMENT OUT

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.836
ENERGY BURDEN. IN DIFFERENT WAYS

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:27.338
AND WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT IT

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:28.739
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CARE VERSUS

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:29.974
NON CARE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.575
READ VERSUS NON RIGHTS IT'S

02:32:31.642 --> 02:32:34.411
REALLY. HOW DO WE DEFINE. THE

02:32:34.478 --> 02:32:35.980
QUADRANTS OF CUSTOMERS THAT

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:36.914
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKE CERTAIN

02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.816
THAT THE ENERGY BURDEN IS

02:32:38.883 --> 02:32:40.184
APPROPRIATE FOR EACH QUADRANT

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:42.620
THAT'S OUT THERE. THAT'S DOABLE

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:44.822
WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. BUT IT'S

02:32:44.889 --> 02:32:46.257
GOING TO REQUIRE SOME WORK AND

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:46.991
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS

02:32:47.057 --> 02:32:50.694
COMMITTEE WANTS. TO THINK

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:51.862
THROUGH YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:58.135
DIRECTION- I WEIGHED A SAY AS

02:32:58.202 --> 02:32:59.837
PART OF THAT DIRECTION IT SHOULD

02:32:59.904 --> 02:33:01.472
BE THE OVERALL GUIDANCE THAT WE

02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:03.307
WANT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS

02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:05.009
OF WHERE YOU SAID IN TERMS OF

02:33:05.075 --> 02:33:06.710
INCOME TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:08.679
YOU HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AN

02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:10.581
AFFORDABLE CLEAN AND SAFE

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:12.516
RELIABLE ENERGY SYSTEM THAT

02:33:12.583 --> 02:33:15.219
SHOULD BE THE MANDATE- IN EACH

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:16.787
OF THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE TRADE

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:18.055
OFFS ATTACHED TO IT I COULD

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:19.857
BUILD YOU THE MOST AFFORDABLE

02:33:19.924 --> 02:33:20.891
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. BUT THERE

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:22.793
MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF BLACKOUTS

02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:24.128
AND MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:25.629
OUTCOME WHEN WE'RE ELECTRIFYING

02:33:25.696 --> 02:33:27.598
THE ECONOMY I COULD BUILD TO THE

02:33:27.665 --> 02:33:28.232
CLEANEST SYSTEM IN THE WORLD-

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:29.633
THAT WOULD WE HAS RELIABILITY

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.535
ISSUES UNLESS WE OVER INVEST IN

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:32.836
CERTAIN WAYS THERE'S ALWAYS

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:33.938
GOING TO BE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN

02:33:34.004 --> 02:33:35.673
EACH OF THESE METRICS THAT I'M

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:37.675
SORT OF THROWING OUT THERE BUT I

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:39.209
THINK THE RIGHT BALANCE IS GOING

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:40.844
TO BE BETWEEN HOW DO WE GET

02:33:40.911 --> 02:33:41.912
AFFORDABLE CLEAN SAFE RELIABLE

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:45.182
SYSTEMS AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT.

02:33:45.249 --> 02:33:46.216
ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:48.886
IT. AND I DID WANT TO PIVOT FROM

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:51.221
THAT INTO. SOMETHING THAT I'VE

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:53.791
BEEN HEARING- A LITTLE BIT OF

02:33:53.857 --> 02:33:55.926
WHILE. RATES ARE TOO HIGH WE'RE

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:58.429
GONNA HAVE TO SLOW DOWN ON OUR

02:33:58.495 --> 02:33:59.029
CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:00.664
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE.

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:02.600
I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG

02:34:02.666 --> 02:34:03.901
APPROACH- I WANT TO UPLOAD

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.069
SOMETHING THAT MARK TONY SAID OF

02:34:05.135 --> 02:34:07.404
HOW DO WE GET THE MOST GREEN FOR

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:09.473
THE LEAST GREEN. AND I WANTED TO

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:12.843
TAKE A MOMENT TO GO THROUGH-

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:14.078
SOME RECENT WORK THAT

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:15.546
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUNDED IN

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:16.780
PARTNERSHIP WITH CLEAN AIR TASK

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:19.750
FORCE ON. CAN WE ACTUALLY CHIEF

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:21.018
ARE SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.119
OBJECTIVES CAN WE FULLY

02:34:22.186 --> 02:34:23.621
DECARBONISE THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM

02:34:23.687 --> 02:34:26.724
AND DO SO IN AN AFFORDABLE

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:27.625
RELIABLE WAY. AND THE ANSWER IS

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:28.993
YES TO SKIP DOWN TO THE PUNCH

02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:31.195
LINE WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE'RE

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:32.029
GONNA HAVE TO START MAKING

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:33.831
DIFFERENT PROCUREMENT CHOICES

02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:34.898
AND DIFFERENT CHOICES ON

02:34:34.965 --> 02:34:37.301
TRANSMISSION AND LOOKING AT WHAT

02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:39.003
OUR LAND USE IS WHAT OUR

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:39.770
PERMITTING PROCESS IS RUN AFTER

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:42.106
THINK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT

02:34:42.172 --> 02:34:43.073
MORE HOLISTICALLY. BUT WE CAN'T

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:45.809
DO IT. AND TO ANSWER ONE OF THE

02:34:45.876 --> 02:34:47.778
QUESTIONS THAT I HEARD EARLIER

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:49.046
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO MISTER

02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:50.414
BAKER. AND THE COST OF

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:52.816
RENEWABLES NOW IS SO INEXPENSIVE

02:34:52.883 --> 02:34:54.852
THAT A SYSTEM MODELERS GOING TO

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:56.954
SAY WELL LET'S JUST ADD A TON OF

02:34:57.021 --> 02:34:59.056
THAT LET'S JUST GO ON AND ON

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:00.424
SELECT THREE CENTS AND THAT'S

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:01.659
THE RIGHT CALL FOR THE MOST

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:03.961
PART. BUT JUST LIKE YOUR STOP

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:05.629
BUT- PORTFOLIO YOU WANT TO HAVE

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:07.398
A BALANCED DIVERSE PORTFOLIO

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:08.866
DIVERSITY IS GOING TO ACTUALLY

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:11.035
HELP CONTAIN COSTS HERE IN SO

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:13.037
WHEN YOU HAVE A REPAIR ADVOCACY

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.538
GROUP OR WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:15.406
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP WHEN YOU

02:35:15.472 --> 02:35:16.840
HAVE ANYONE COMING IN TO YOU AND

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:18.876
SAYING THIS IS A REALLY

02:35:18.942 --> 02:35:20.144
IMPORTANT PROJECT AND IT'S SO

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.845
CHEAP. WE NEED TO THINK WELL

02:35:21.912 --> 02:35:22.980
WHAT'S THE COST OF THIS

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:24.248
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT AND WHAT'S

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:26.617
THE TOTAL SYSTEM COST IF WE CAN

02:35:26.684 --> 02:35:27.951
THINK ABOUT THE TOTAL SYSTEM

02:35:28.018 --> 02:35:29.486
COSTS WE MIGHT BE BUYING A

02:35:29.553 --> 02:35:32.256
COUPLE OF- GENERATIONAL UNITS

02:35:32.322 --> 02:35:33.023
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:35.192
EXPENSIVE OR WE MIGHT BE DOING

02:35:35.259 --> 02:35:35.959
SOME TRANSMISSION LINES THAT ARE

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.861
NEW. BUT ARE GOING TO BE COST

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:40.097
EFFETIVE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:41.999
FROM THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND SO

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:43.701
THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRADE OFF

02:35:43.767 --> 02:35:44.868
THEIR OF IS THIS A LITTLE BIT

02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:45.769
MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WE'RE

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:46.837
DEFERRING FIVE OF THE OTHER

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:49.006
CHEAP THINGS AND IS THAT A GOOD

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:51.508
INVESTMENT TO MAKE- I. A I

02:35:51.575 --> 02:35:53.177
APOLOGIZE. I WANTED TO MAKE

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:54.712
CERTAIN TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:56.146
THEY DID REALLY TREMENDOUS WORK

02:35:56.213 --> 02:35:58.115
FOR US- THIS REPORT. THE LINK IS

02:35:58.182 --> 02:35:59.850
THERE IT WAS UNDER PINE WITH

02:35:59.917 --> 02:36:01.618
MODELING WORK FROM PRINCETON

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.854
STANFORD AND P. THREE- WITH THE

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:05.923
BASIC IDEA HERE THAT ONE MODEL

02:36:05.989 --> 02:36:06.890
GOOD THREE MODEL GETS. IS

02:36:06.957 --> 02:36:08.859
BETTER- AND REALLY WANT TO

02:36:08.926 --> 02:36:10.094
HIGHLIGHT HOW FANTASTIC THAT

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.396
WORK AS- AND I'M NOT AT ALL

02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:14.398
BIASED BECAUSE MY NAME IS ALSO

02:36:14.465 --> 02:36:17.101
ON IT BUT- I DID WANT TO

02:36:17.167 --> 02:36:19.737
HIGHLIGHT HERE. AND AGAIN MY

02:36:19.803 --> 02:36:22.139
THINKING OF I DON'T THINK THAT

02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:25.008
WE SHOULD BE SLOWING DOWN. OUR

02:36:25.075 --> 02:36:26.710
CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:29.046
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT

02:36:29.113 --> 02:36:30.147
WE'RE KEEPING THE GREAT

02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:32.716
AFFORDABLE. AND I APOLOGIZE AT

02:36:32.783 --> 02:36:34.952
ON THE SCREEN OVER THERE IT IS

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.286
CUT OFF A LITTLE BIT IT IS

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:37.955
SHOWING UP RIGHT ON THE SLIDE SO

02:36:38.021 --> 02:36:39.957
I HOPE IT'S PRINTING OUT FOR YOU

02:36:40.023 --> 02:36:42.092
AS WELL OKAY BUT I WILL DO MY

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:44.128
BEST TO TALK THROUGH THAT'S- ONE

02:36:44.194 --> 02:36:46.363
OF THE RESULTS HERE. IS THIS

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:47.765
DOTTED LINE IS CALIFORNIA'S

02:36:47.831 --> 02:36:49.933
CURRENT THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.368
NUMBER SO IT'S CHANGED SLIGHTLY

02:36:51.435 --> 02:36:52.836
BUT- I CALIFORNIA'S MARLYS

02:36:52.903 --> 02:36:54.772
CURRENT. GENERATION AND

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:56.607
TRANSMISSION RATE AT ABOUT NINE

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.809
CENTS IN THE SUGGEST FOR THE

02:36:58.876 --> 02:37:01.545
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. I THAT

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:03.180
RATE IS GOING TO GO UP WE'RE

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:05.382
GOING TO GO YEAH IT'S GOING TO

02:37:05.449 --> 02:37:07.484
GO UP A LITTLE BIT- MAY BE BY IF

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:08.852
WE WERE TO SEE ON THE PATHWAY

02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:10.788
THAT WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW AND

02:37:10.854 --> 02:37:12.523
REALLY GO AFTER OUR FULL

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:13.824
DECARBONIZATION GOALS AND THAT

02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:15.259
INCLUDES DOUBLING THE SIZE OF

02:37:15.325 --> 02:37:16.627
THE ELECTRIC GRADE TO ACCOUNT

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:18.061
FOR ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:37:18.128 --> 02:37:19.963
FOR ALL THE NEW HOMES THAT ARE

02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.031
GONNA BE ELECTRIFIED FOR

02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:21.832
EVERYTHING. ELSE REALLY TRYING

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:23.600
TO LECTURE FIVE THE ECONOMY AND

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:24.768
FULLY ELIMINATE EMISSIONS FROM

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:27.938
THAT WE CAN DO IT. IN A WAY BUT

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:30.207
IF WE STAY ON THE SHORT DURATION

02:37:30.274 --> 02:37:32.409
BATTERY PLUS STOLAR ONLY MODEL

02:37:32.476 --> 02:37:33.744
IN SOLICITING THE CHEAPEST

02:37:33.811 --> 02:37:35.612
RENEWABLE THAT'S OUT THERE.

02:37:35.679 --> 02:37:37.147
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA SEE A

02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:38.148
DOUBLING OF RATES ON THAT

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:40.317
METRIC. BUT IF WE LOOK TO

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:42.486
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:43.053
MORE EXPENSIVE BUT CAN HELP

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:44.555
CONTAIN OVERALL SYSTEM COST AND

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:45.823
WE'RE TURNING THIS A CLEAN FROM

02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:47.958
POWER APPROACH. THESE ARE ANY OF

02:37:48.025 --> 02:37:50.460
THE OPTIONS THAT ARE ON THE LEFT

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:51.862
HAND SIDE. WE CAN ACTUALLY DO

02:37:51.929 --> 02:37:54.097
ALL OF THAT WORK AND KEEP RATES

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:54.898
MORE OR LESS WHERE THEY'RE AT

02:37:54.965 --> 02:37:59.937
TODAY. SO GIVING SOME GUIDANCE

02:38:00.003 --> 02:38:02.039
TO THE TO REGULATORS TO SAY.

02:38:02.105 --> 02:38:04.474
IT'S OKAY TO LOOK AT AN

02:38:04.541 --> 02:38:05.776
INDIVIDUAL POWER PURCHASE

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.911
AGREEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO OKAY TO

02:38:07.978 --> 02:38:09.379
LOOK AT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.315
SYSTEM COST. AND WHAT THE

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:12.649
OVERALL BALANCE THERE'S GOING TO

02:38:12.716 --> 02:38:14.518
BE. I THINK THAT IS AN

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:16.353
APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE IN METRIC

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:19.923
THAT WE SHOULD DO- I DO WANNA UP

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:21.425
WITH SOMETHING THAT I HEARD BOTH

02:38:21.491 --> 02:38:22.826
DR TONY AND MISTER BAKER SAY.

02:38:22.893 --> 02:38:24.795
DURING THEIR PRESENTATIONS. THE

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:26.763
SINGLE LARGEST DRIVER OF RATES

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.665
IS NOT GOING TO BE. NEW

02:38:28.732 --> 02:38:30.500
GENERATION OR NEW TRANSMISSION

02:38:30.567 --> 02:38:32.169
IT REALLY IS THE WILDFIRE COST

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:33.871
AND SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS

02:38:33.937 --> 02:38:35.239
TO CONTAIN COSTS IN TO GIVE

02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:37.207
CUSTOMERS AND BILL RELIEF. WHAT

02:38:37.274 --> 02:38:38.942
I'M TRYING TO SAY AFTER THIS

02:38:39.009 --> 02:38:40.544
REALLY COMPLICATED GRAPH IS.

02:38:40.611 --> 02:38:41.678
DON'T LOOK TOWARDS THE CLEAN

02:38:41.745 --> 02:38:43.747
ENERGY AGENDA TO HELP SAVE COSTS

02:38:43.814 --> 02:38:44.982
THEIR WAYS OF KEEPING THESE

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:46.583
COSTS JUST REASONABLE

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:48.819
AFFORDABLE. LET'S LOOK AT THE

02:38:48.886 --> 02:38:50.954
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MOVING

02:38:51.021 --> 02:38:52.322
THE NEEDLE ON THE BILL ITSELF.

02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:56.093
AND TO PICK THAT ONE MORE TIME I

02:38:56.159 --> 02:38:58.462
DID WANT TO ALSO SAY AS WE ARE

02:38:58.528 --> 02:38:59.630
THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE

02:38:59.696 --> 02:39:01.331
GUIDANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:02.933
ITSELF CAN DO TO HELP THINK

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.402
THROUGH AFFORDABILITY I DO THINK

02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:07.371
IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK THROUGH

02:39:07.437 --> 02:39:09.039
WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:11.108
AND NON MONETARY BENEFITS AND

02:39:11.174 --> 02:39:12.509
THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT

02:39:12.576 --> 02:39:14.278
CUSTOMERS INTERACT WITH ON THEIR

02:39:14.344 --> 02:39:16.747
ENERGY BILL BUT ALL THE BENEFITS

02:39:16.813 --> 02:39:18.015
ARE GOING TO BE CAPTURED IN THE

02:39:18.081 --> 02:39:19.917
RIGHT WAY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF

02:39:19.983 --> 02:39:21.785
THIS SLIDE I JUST WANTED TO TALK

02:39:21.852 --> 02:39:23.220
A MOMENT ABOUT VEHICLE

02:39:23.287 --> 02:39:24.721
ELECTRIFICATION OR ZERO EMISSION

02:39:24.788 --> 02:39:27.391
VEHICLES MORE BROADLY. AND I

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:28.725
REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON MEDIUM

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:30.694
AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THESE

02:39:30.761 --> 02:39:33.430
ARE RELATIVELY SMALL BY NUMBER

02:39:33.497 --> 02:39:36.066
BUT A HUGE BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:36.967
REDUCING BOTH LOCAL AIR

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:38.669
POLLUTION. THINGS THAT CAUSE

02:39:38.735 --> 02:39:41.071
ASTHMA AND OTHER HEALTH IMPACTS

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:42.005
AND ALSO GREENHOUSE GAS

02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:43.907
EMISSIONS. NOW IF WE WERE TO

02:39:43.974 --> 02:39:45.375
TAKE SORT OF A SCATTERSHOT

02:39:45.442 --> 02:39:48.011
APPROACH AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE

02:39:48.078 --> 02:39:50.347
FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES- WE HAVE

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:50.948
TO MAKE INVESTMENTS EVERYWHERE

02:39:51.014 --> 02:39:53.050
ALL AT ONCE- IT'S REALLY

02:39:53.116 --> 02:39:54.751
EXPENSIVE AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

02:39:54.818 --> 02:39:56.186
GET TO CAPTURE THAT MANY OF

02:39:56.253 --> 02:39:57.888
THESE SORT OF EXTRA NON MONETARY

02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.190
BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY. BUT IF YOU

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:02.192
LOOK AT WHERE THE TRUCKS AND

02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:03.327
BUSES THEMSELVES ARE OPERATING

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:05.295
IN CONCENTRATING PRIORITIZE YOUR

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.564
INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS. AND

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:10.067
WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE KNOW

02:40:10.133 --> 02:40:11.201
THE VEHICLES ARE REGISTERED WIN

02:40:11.268 --> 02:40:12.269
OVER THE PORTS ARE WIN OVER THE

02:40:12.336 --> 02:40:13.870
HIGHWAY CORRIDORS ARE. YOU END

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:15.973
UP GETTING AN UP LIFT IT OF

02:40:16.039 --> 02:40:17.641
REALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:19.109
EACH OF THESE ARE DISADVANTAGED

02:40:19.176 --> 02:40:20.143
COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED BY COLIN

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.878
VIRUS SCREEN AND YOU END UP

02:40:21.945 --> 02:40:23.714
GETTING FOR RELATIVELY MODEST

02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:26.183
REPAIR INVESTMENT. ON THE

02:40:26.249 --> 02:40:28.118
INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE HUGE

02:40:28.185 --> 02:40:30.420
BENEFITS ON HEALTH AND ON LOCAL

02:40:30.487 --> 02:40:32.556
ENVIRONMENTAL OF OUTCOMES. IN SO

02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:34.958
THINKING THROUGH WHERE DO WE

02:40:35.025 --> 02:40:36.226
MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN HAVING

02:40:36.293 --> 02:40:37.961
THE LEGISLATURE GETS SOME SORT

02:40:38.028 --> 02:40:40.497
OF SENSE OF PRIORITY. IS REALLY

02:40:40.564 --> 02:40:42.733
IMPORTANT HERE. IF WE ARE

02:40:42.799 --> 02:40:44.935
TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE FREE UP

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:47.104
ADDITIONAL INCOME FOR CUSTOMERS.

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:48.405
WHILE GIVING SOME ADDITIONAL

02:40:48.472 --> 02:40:50.240
INCOME BY REDUCTION AND HEALTH

02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:53.810
IMPACTS IS A HUGE BENEFIT TO OUT

02:40:53.877 --> 02:40:57.581
BEDS OUT THERE. AND I KNOW THAT.

02:40:57.647 --> 02:40:58.782
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE GREAT

02:40:58.849 --> 02:41:00.650
UPGRADES THE PAST IS NOT GOING

02:41:00.717 --> 02:41:01.985
TO BE A PREDICTOR OF THE FUTURE

02:41:02.052 --> 02:41:04.521
WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK TO NEW

02:41:04.588 --> 02:41:05.689
SOURCES OF DATA. THAT'S POSSIBLE

02:41:05.756 --> 02:41:07.791
WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT THAT THE

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:08.892
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED TO

02:41:08.959 --> 02:41:10.827
GET SOME DIRECTION HERE. AND

02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:11.995
THIS IS MY LAST FLIGHT BECAUSE I

02:41:12.062 --> 02:41:14.031
REALLY DO WANT THIS TO BE MUCH

02:41:14.097 --> 02:41:15.699
MORE OF A DIALOGUE BUT I WANTED

02:41:15.766 --> 02:41:17.601
TO. OFFER UP A LITTLE BIT OF

02:41:17.667 --> 02:41:19.669
COMMENTARY- THIS WAS ALLUDED TO

02:41:19.736 --> 02:41:21.304
BY BOTH OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:23.273
SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS. A

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:25.509
REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT BUT WHO IS

02:41:25.575 --> 02:41:27.310
PAYING AND WHO SHOULD BE PAYING.

02:41:27.377 --> 02:41:27.911
WELL THERE'S CERTAIN CUSTOMER

02:41:27.978 --> 02:41:28.845
INVESTMENTS ARE GONNA BE

02:41:28.912 --> 02:41:30.847
CAPTURED ON BILL SON THAT THE

02:41:30.914 --> 02:41:31.948
CUSTOMER THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO

02:41:32.015 --> 02:41:32.849
BE PAYING FOR JUST. ON THEIR

02:41:32.916 --> 02:41:34.818
CREDIT CARD. OR ON SOME SORT OF

02:41:34.885 --> 02:41:36.953
PRIVATE FINANCE. THEIR TAXPAYER

02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:38.922
INVESTMENTS AND THEN THERE ARE

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:39.689
SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENTS AND I

02:41:39.756 --> 02:41:45.195
pGUIDANCE ON. ALL FOR THESE- IF I

02:41:45.262 --> 02:41:47.764
CAN RESPOND TO SOMETHING. THAT

02:41:47.831 --> 02:41:49.533
THE FIRST TWO SPEAKERS SAID. I

02:41:49.599 --> 02:41:50.834
THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.469
AGAIN TO BE LOOKING TOWARDS

02:41:52.536 --> 02:41:53.804
WILDFIRE MITIGATION COSTS AT

02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:55.172
SOMETHING THAT MAY BE TAXPAYERS

02:41:55.238 --> 02:41:56.573
SHOULD BE PICKING UP THE- BILL

02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.310
FOR. THAT IT IS VERY CLEARLY. A

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:02.179
SOCIAL PROBLEM THAT ALL

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:04.347
CUSTOMERS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:05.182
YOU'RE LOCATED ARE BEING

02:42:05.248 --> 02:42:08.852
IMPACTED BY THAT MAKES A LOT OF

02:42:08.919 --> 02:42:10.387
SENSE TO ME FOR RATE RELIEF. AND

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:11.721
THERE ARE OTHER INVESTMENTS

02:42:11.788 --> 02:42:13.690
WHERE MAYBE WE NEED TO BE

02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:14.925
THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IS THE

02:42:14.991 --> 02:42:17.427
APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR TAXPAYER

02:42:17.494 --> 02:42:18.862
AND RATEPAYER MONIES TO BE

02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:22.499
WORKING TOGETHER- I. HAVE SO

02:42:22.566 --> 02:42:24.434
MUCH RESPECT FOR DR TONY BUT I

02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:26.069
DISAGREE WITH HIM WITH HIS

02:42:26.136 --> 02:42:26.603
RECOMMENDATION ON BUILDING

02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:28.705
ELECTRIFICATION I ACTUALLY THINK

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:29.906
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:31.675
DO WE LEVERAGE RATEPAYER MONEY

02:42:31.741 --> 02:42:33.643
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DIRECT

02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:35.779
INCENTIVES IS ONE APPROACH BUT

02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:37.714
CAN WE GET ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE

02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:39.049
FROM THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE

02:42:39.116 --> 02:42:40.917
REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS HAVE BY

02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:43.787
DOWNS OF RATES OF LOANS DO OTHER

02:42:43.854 --> 02:42:45.889
THINGS TO HELP DO THIS. THE SIZE

02:42:45.956 --> 02:42:47.057
AND SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM THAT'S

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:48.859
OUT THERE IS REALLY NO SENSE

02:42:48.925 --> 02:42:51.161
THAT HATING THAT THIS IS GOING

02:42:51.228 --> 02:42:53.763
TO BE A MAJOR INVESTMENT. I ALSO

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:55.265
NOTE THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:56.433
TARGET THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT

02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.934
JUST TO LOW INCOME POPULATIONS

02:42:58.001 --> 02:42:59.336
WHICH MAY HAVE TROUBLE PAYING

02:42:59.402 --> 02:43:00.704
FOR AN UPGRADE AT THE BEGINNING

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:02.372
THAT WOULD BE A VERY. THAT WOULD

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:04.241
BE A INVESTMENT IT MAKES LOT OF

02:43:04.307 --> 02:43:05.942
SENSE. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:43:06.009 --> 02:43:07.010
THE OVERALL ENERGY BURDEN. IT

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:09.646
SHOULD BE HOW DO WE HELP LOWER

02:43:09.713 --> 02:43:11.148
INCOME CUSTOMERS AND ALSO MAKE

02:43:11.214 --> 02:43:12.282
CERTAIN THAT THE REMAINING GAS

02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:13.416
CUSTOMERS WHO AREN'T MAKING

02:43:13.483 --> 02:43:14.518
THOSE ELECTRIFICATION

02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:15.919
INVESTMENTS DON'T HAVE THEIR

02:43:15.986 --> 02:43:17.521
BILLS SKYROCKET BECAUSE AGAIN

02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:19.222
IT'S OVERALL ENERGY BURDEN THAT

02:43:19.289 --> 02:43:20.223
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.626
HERE. SO IS THERE A WAY THAT WE

02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:23.994
CAN TARGET THE INVESTMENT SO

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:26.029
THAT WE CAN RETIRE SOME GAS

02:43:26.096 --> 02:43:28.298
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CANTAKES

02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:29.432
AT LEAST EXPENSIVE COSTS OUT OF

02:43:29.499 --> 02:43:32.736
RATES- THERE'S SOME OTHER

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:34.671
COMMENTARY THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:43:34.738 --> 02:43:36.139
ADDRESS AS WELL ON SOME OF HE

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:37.574
OTHER LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT I

02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:39.042
KNOW CHAIR GARCIA WAS ASKING

02:43:39.109 --> 02:43:39.976
ABOUT I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:43:40.043 --> 02:43:41.945
IF THE COMMITTEE WANTS BUT I

02:43:42.012 --> 02:43:45.348
THINK- FOR EACH OF THESE ITEMS I

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:47.517
THINK THERE IS A ROLE FOR ALL

02:43:47.584 --> 02:43:49.119
FOUR SETS OF WALLETS TO BE

02:43:49.186 --> 02:43:51.021
PAYING- AND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:53.223
THE LAST NOTE THAT I WANT TO

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:55.058
MAKE HERE- WHEN IT COMES TO

02:43:55.125 --> 02:43:58.361
LEGACY COST IN LEGACY PROGRAMS.

02:43:58.428 --> 02:44:00.830
THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT THAT HAS

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:03.300
TO OCCUR INCALIFORNIA. IS GOING

02:44:03.366 --> 02:44:06.336
TO BE SIGNIFICANT. AND SOME OF

02:44:06.403 --> 02:44:08.271
THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE THROUGH

02:44:08.338 --> 02:44:10.040
THE UTILITY PROGRAMS AND SOME OF

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.175
THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN OTHER

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:15.679
WAYS BUT IF WE- ARE GOING TO BE

02:44:15.745 --> 02:44:16.780
MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS IN

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:17.614
MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS AS

02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:19.749
CHEAPLY AS WE CAN WE HAVE TO

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:21.985
MAKE THEM RISKY. LESS RISKY

02:44:22.052 --> 02:44:23.687
EXCUSE ME WE DON'T WANT TO

02:44:23.753 --> 02:44:24.888
INCREASE RISK WE WANT TO

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:26.690
DECREASE STRESS WE WANT TO MAKE

02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:28.758
THEM AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE FROM A

02:44:28.825 --> 02:44:29.893
RISK PERSPECTIVE. PREDICTABILITY

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.094
AND SECURITISATION ARE GREAT

02:44:31.161 --> 02:44:32.896
TOOLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS

02:44:32.963 --> 02:44:35.098
HOW TO DO. ANYTHING THAT WE CAN

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:37.100
DO TO LOWER THE COST OF CAPITAL

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:39.002
THAT WE CAN DO TO LOWER THE

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:40.237
BORROWING COSTS ARE GREAT. IN

02:44:40.303 --> 02:44:42.405
SAID THAT MAY MEAN WE HAVE TO

02:44:42.472 --> 02:44:44.374
HONOR THE PROMISES OF THE PAST

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:46.109
IN ORDER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

02:44:46.176 --> 02:44:47.244
THE FUTURE INVESTMENTS ARE AS

02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:50.046
CHEAP AS POSSIBLE. SO SECURITIZE

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:51.848
ING IN TAKING OUT OF RATE BASE

02:44:51.915 --> 02:44:54.150
IS ONE OPTION OR SAYING LOOK IT

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:55.518
WOULD BE GREAT TED TAKE

02:44:55.585 --> 02:44:56.753
SOMETHING OUT OF RATE BASE AND

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.021
TO SAY SHAREHOLDERS HAVE TO EAT

02:44:58.088 --> 02:45:00.423
THAT COST. BUT IT MIGHT BE PENNY

02:45:00.490 --> 02:45:01.758
WISE AND POUND FOOLISH TO DO

02:45:01.825 --> 02:45:03.293
THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.628
CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE A VERY

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:06.529
RISKY PLACE TO DO BUSINESS IN

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:08.331
FUTURE INVESTMENTS FOR

02:45:08.398 --> 02:45:09.799

02:45:09.866 --> 02:45:11.635

02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:13.870
THERE IS A BALANCE THERE SO AS

FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS RENTS

02:46:57.774 --> 02:47:01.845
COLEMAN I PREPARED PAUL DIES IF

02:47:01.911 --> 02:47:03.613
. YOU ARE THE WRONG PERSON TO

02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:05.849
ASK THIS QUESTION OF BUT- I'LL

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:08.151
DO MY BEST ALL RIGHT IN THE

02:47:08.218 --> 02:47:09.552
COMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT

02:47:09.619 --> 02:47:12.589
WAS PROVIDED TO US ONE OF THE

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:15.725
SOLUTIONS THAT WAS LISTED. OF

02:47:15.792 --> 02:47:18.361
FOR A REDUCING THESE COSTS WAS

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:19.596
TO LIMIT THE INVESTOR OWNED

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:22.499
UTILITIES RETURN ON EQUITY. AS A

02:47:22.565 --> 02:47:26.236
WAY TO LIMIT THE COST OF RATES.

02:47:26.302 --> 02:47:29.773
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT OF COURSE-

02:47:29.839 --> 02:47:35.145
AND. THE SUIT SO I THINK THERE'S

02:47:35.211 --> 02:47:37.280
A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:37.947
REALLY INTERESTING WITH AND

02:47:38.014 --> 02:47:42.452
THAT'S THE FIRST ONE IS. I RIGHT

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:45.121
NOW A COMBINED FUEL UTILITY LIKE

02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:46.990
SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:49.092
PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. THEY

02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:52.495
EARN THE SAME AMOUNT OF RETURN.

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:54.631
FOR EVERY CAPITAL INVESTMENT

02:47:54.697 --> 02:47:57.300
REGARDLESS OF ITS TYPE IF THEY

02:47:57.367 --> 02:48:00.403
MAKE AN INVESTMENT ON A GAS PIPE

02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:02.705
OR ON A TRANSMISSION WIRE. IT'S

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.741
THE SAME AMOUNT OF RETURN THAT'S

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:06.943
PROBABLY THE WRONG OUTCOME IF WE

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.877
ARE LOOKING TOWARDS

02:48:07.944 --> 02:48:10.547
DECARBONIZING THE ECONOMY ON A

02:48:10.613 --> 02:48:12.415
MAJOR LEVERAGE OF CLEAN ENERGY

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:14.918
INFRASTRUCTURE WE MIGHT NOT WANT

02:48:14.984 --> 02:48:16.519
TO BE GIVING SHAREHOLDERS THE

02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:19.589
SAME RETURN ON LEGACY GAS

02:48:19.656 --> 02:48:20.690
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN THE

02:48:20.757 --> 02:48:22.859
GROUND VERSES NEW GAS PIPELINE

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:24.828
INVESTMENTS VERSUS NEW ELECTRIC

02:48:24.894 --> 02:48:26.830
INVESTMENTS. INTO ONE OF THE

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:30.033
OPTIONS THAT EDF HAS ADVOCATED

02:48:30.099 --> 02:48:31.100
FOR ON AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:48:31.167 --> 02:48:33.403
COMMISSION AND FOR PROCEDURAL

02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:34.838
REASONS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE

02:48:34.904 --> 02:48:37.273
ASK FOR IT AGAIN NEXT MONTH IN

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.174
THEIR NEW COST TO CAPITAL

02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:39.476
PROCEEDING BUT THAT'S NEITHER

02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:43.079
HERE NOR THERE IS TO BIFURCATE

02:48:43.146 --> 02:48:44.981
HOW SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE THAT

02:48:45.048 --> 02:48:46.583
SIGNAL TO SAY LEGACY GAS

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:48.618
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT GET ONE

02:48:48.685 --> 02:48:51.688
REWARD. AND LEGACY

02:48:51.754 --> 02:48:52.922
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ELECTRIC

02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:55.158
MIGHT GET ANOTHER- AND WHEN YOU

02:48:55.225 --> 02:48:56.926
THINK ABOUT IT HERE UP IN THE

02:48:56.993 --> 02:48:59.662
SACRAMENTO AREA SACRAMENTO

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:02.799
CUSTOMERS ARE. SERVED BY PACIFIC

02:49:02.866 --> 02:49:04.100
GAS AND ELECTRIC FOR THEIR GAS

02:49:04.167 --> 02:49:05.802
SERVICE SINCE NOT FOR THEIR

02:49:05.869 --> 02:49:07.637
ELECTRIC SERVICE SAYS YOU'RE

02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:09.072
WELL AWARE- THE UTILITIES WHEN

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:10.807
THEY SAY HERE'S OUR TOP RISKS

02:49:10.874 --> 02:49:12.375
HERE'S THE TOP AREAS OF WHY

02:49:12.442 --> 02:49:14.010
CALIFORNIA DESERVES A PREMIUM I

02:49:14.077 --> 02:49:15.411
DON'T THINK ACTUALLY DESERVE A

02:49:15.478 --> 02:49:16.212
PREMIUM BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.581
STORY. THEY ONLY SITE ELECTRIC

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:20.850
RISKS IN SO WHY SHOULD GAS ONLY

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:23.419
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE HERE IN THIS

02:49:23.486 --> 02:49:25.722
AREA. HEY FOR A RATE ICREASE

02:49:25.788 --> 02:49:27.790
WHEN IT'S TO COMPENSATE FOR

02:49:27.857 --> 02:49:28.992
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE NOT EVEN

02:49:29.058 --> 02:49:30.760
RECEIVING THE SERVICE FOR. IN SO

02:49:30.827 --> 02:49:32.729
WE SHOULD THINK THROUGH WHAT IS

02:49:32.795 --> 02:49:34.464
THE DIFFERENCE ON GAS VERSUS

02:49:34.531 --> 02:49:36.332
ELECTRIC AND HOW DO WE REWARD

02:49:36.399 --> 02:49:37.333
SHAREHOLDERS THE OTHER PART OF

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:40.637
THAT ANSWER IN MY OPINION IS IF

02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:41.905
WE WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

02:49:41.971 --> 02:49:44.274
THAT. WE WE'D BE ABLE TO GIVE

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:45.308
SHAREHOLDERS A SIGNAL TO SAY

02:49:45.375 --> 02:49:46.442
HERE'S WHAT YOUR NEXT DOLLARS

02:49:46.509 --> 02:49:47.977
GOING TO GO AND HERE'S HOW IT'S

02:49:48.044 --> 02:49:50.113
GOING TO ALIGN WITH THE CUSTOMER

02:49:50.179 --> 02:49:50.813
INTEREST WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:53.116
INTEREST. IN SO I THINK ONE OF

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:54.584
THE PIECES OF GUIDANCE I COULD

02:49:54.651 --> 02:49:56.219
BE OUT THERE IS TO SAY. LET'S

02:49:56.286 --> 02:49:57.954
HAVE RETURN ON EQUITY ACTUALLY

02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:00.757
REWARD THE RISK FOR THE

02:50:00.823 --> 02:50:02.525
APPROPRIATE LINE OF BUSINESS NOT

02:50:02.592 --> 02:50:04.594
THE OVERALL COMPANY STRUCTURE.

02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:05.929
THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:07.163
THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:09.332
COMMISSION YET THAT IT'S ONE

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:10.667
WAY. THAT IS CERTAINLY WITHIN

02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:11.568
THE COMMISSION'S EXISTING

02:50:11.634 --> 02:50:12.902
AUTHORITY AT THE LEGISLATURE

02:50:12.969 --> 02:50:14.304
COULD GIVE THEM A KNOWLEDGE AND

02:50:14.370 --> 02:50:16.339
HELP POINT TOWARD SAYS. THAT WAY

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:17.840
TO. REDUCE COSTS ALMOST

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:20.910
IMMEDIATELY. I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:25.682
THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU ARE

02:50:25.748 --> 02:50:28.718
ANY OTHER MEMBERS. OKAY ALL

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:31.220
RIGHT MISTER COLVIN I HAVE A FEW

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:36.826
QUESTIONS- SELF- FIRST OF ALL A

02:50:36.893 --> 02:50:42.932
- V. BRIEFING PACKET OF AND THAT

02:50:42.999 --> 02:50:44.367
THE COMMITTEE PROVIDED TO-

02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:53.476
INDICATES. THAT- SERVICE CENTER-

02:50:53.543 --> 02:51:00.717
V. ARRIGO. THE CROSS ALL ALL

02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:01.884
THREE I'LL USE RATES HAVE

02:51:01.951 --> 02:51:03.686
INCREASED SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN

02:51:03.753 --> 02:51:06.389
THE GROWTH AND RATES CAN- CAN BE

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:07.624
LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASES

02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:09.792
FROM FROM- INFRASTRUCTURE

02:51:09.859 --> 02:51:14.797
PROJECTS AND INSIGHTS- IF YOU

02:51:14.864 --> 02:51:16.966
SEE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

STUDY- WITH- IDENTIFYING

02:51:19.736 --> 02:51:21.137
TRANSMISSION BY PG&amp;E AND

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:23.873
DISTRIBUTION BY S. C. E. N. S.

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:26.843
T. G. N. E. R. WOULD YOU CONCUR

02:51:26.909 --> 02:51:30.113
WITH THAT- AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:31.180
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT THE

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:33.783
REPORT SAYS I THINK THERE IS A

02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:34.717
LITTLE BIT OF NEW WANTS

02:51:34.784 --> 02:51:36.452
HAPPENING WITHIN THOSE NUMBERS

02:51:36.519 --> 02:51:39.355
THE LARGEST DRIVER FROM MY READ

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:40.857
OF THOSE REPORTS AND LOOKING AT

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:41.891
THE UNDERLYING SPREADSHEETS

02:51:41.958 --> 02:51:43.693
REALLY IS THE WILDFIRE COST THIS

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:46.029
IS WHERE THEY GET RECORDED- IT'S

02:51:46.095 --> 02:51:48.564
SORT OF. A DIFFERENT BY EACH

02:51:48.631 --> 02:51:50.500
UTILITY. AND THE OTHER

02:51:50.566 --> 02:51:52.402
OBSERVATION THAT I WOULD MAKE.

02:51:52.468 --> 02:51:55.605
WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THIS IS.

02:51:55.672 --> 02:51:58.041
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUT. OUR

02:51:58.107 --> 02:52:01.277
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE NEED TO

02:52:01.344 --> 02:52:03.479
DO THAT NOW IN ORDER TO LET THE

02:52:03.546 --> 02:52:06.182
ELECTRIC USAGE ITSELF GO UP THAT

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:07.750
WE'RE GOING TO IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:52:07.817 --> 02:52:09.218
BE ELECTRIFYING EVERY SINGLE

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.553
VEHICLE IN THE STATE WHICH IS

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:11.454
WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

02:52:11.521 --> 02:52:13.356
ORDER AS- THERE'S GOING TO NEED

02:52:13.423 --> 02:52:14.691
TO BE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:16.893
OUT TO THE CAR TOWED TO TIE IT.

02:52:16.959 --> 02:52:19.662
TO HAPPEN. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:21.130
STUFF THAT CAN BE DONE USING OUR

02:52:21.197 --> 02:52:23.032
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. ON

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:24.400
FEDERATED SIGN YOU MENTION

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:25.601
DURING ONE OF THE- EARLIER

02:52:25.668 --> 02:52:27.370
QUESTIONS SHOULD THERE BE MORE

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:29.238
THINKING ABOUT RATE REFORM. MY

02:52:29.305 --> 02:52:30.373
ANSWER TO THAT IS AN EMPHATIC

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:31.874
YES I THINK THERE REALLY IS A

02:52:31.941 --> 02:52:33.876
LOT THAT CAN BE DONE TO SEND

02:52:33.943 --> 02:52:35.611
SIGNALS TO CUSTOMERS OF. HERE'S

02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:37.080
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO USE YOUR

02:52:37.146 --> 02:52:38.648
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT USE

02:52:38.715 --> 02:52:40.717
MORE OF THAT AND IF YOU SAT MORE

02:52:40.783 --> 02:52:41.918
SALES OVER THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:43.786
OF FIXED COSTS THE OVERALL BILL

02:52:43.853 --> 02:52:45.688
WILL BE BETTER AND AGAIN AS YOU

02:52:45.755 --> 02:52:48.491
THINK ABOUT. WHAT THE ENERGY.

02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:50.193
BURDEN IS ON CUSTOMERS THE MORE

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:52.228
THAT WE CAN DO THAT SUBSTITUTION

02:52:52.295 --> 02:52:53.763
EFFECT AND LEVERAGE THE EXISTING

02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:56.799
PLATFORM. THE MORE WE'RE ABLE TO

02:52:56.866 --> 02:52:59.936
YOU KNOW BASICALLY SAY LUCK.-FIXED INFRASTRUCTURES THOSE

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.137
COSTS ARE THE SAME NO MATTER

02:53:01.204 --> 02:53:02.905
WHAT WE'RE USING IT MORE THE PER

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:04.741
UNIT COST IS GOING DOWN. THAT'S

02:53:04.807 --> 02:53:07.076
MORE SAVINGS FOR CUSTOMERS SO

02:53:07.143 --> 02:53:10.880
I'M NOT AS BOTHERED- BY SOME OF

02:53:10.947 --> 02:53:12.281
THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DID

02:53:12.348 --> 02:53:13.616
THE OTHER NON WILD CARD NUMBERS

02:53:13.683 --> 02:53:15.351
BECAUSE THEY ARE SENDING OUT

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:18.187
THAT ELECTRIFICATION PLUSH- WHAT

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:20.123
I WANT TO ENSURE. IS THAT ALL

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:21.791
CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

02:53:21.858 --> 02:53:23.659
ENERGY TRANSITION. IN THAT THE

02:53:23.726 --> 02:53:24.894
CUSTOMERS WHO AREN'T ABLE TO

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.062
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT STRAIGHT

02:53:26.129 --> 02:53:28.231
AWAY. ARE NOT LEFT WITH

02:53:28.297 --> 02:53:32.401
SKYROCKETING COSTS. MMHM SO- BUT

02:53:32.468 --> 02:53:34.470
GOING BACK TO MY- ORIGINAL

02:53:34.537 --> 02:53:36.572
QUESTION **** SO YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:53:36.639 --> 02:53:39.509
SAYING IT'S A WHAT IS IT A

02:53:39.575 --> 02:53:41.077
DEFINITIONAL OR OR OR OR

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:42.411
ACCOUNTING GOOD DIFFERENCE

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:44.046
BETWEEN WELL WHETHER IT'S

02:53:44.113 --> 02:53:45.782
CLASSIFIED AS A- AS A-

02:53:45.848 --> 02:53:47.250
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS OF OVER

02:53:47.316 --> 02:53:49.018
SUCH A SO THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:53:49.085 --> 02:53:50.686
COSTS OF WHETHER IT'S ON

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:52.288
TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION I

02:53:52.355 --> 02:53:53.689
THINK IT IT'S MORE JUST THE

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:55.158
NATURE OF THE SERVICE TERRITORY

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:56.793
ITSELF WHERE PG&amp;E HAS TO DO MOST

02:53:56.859 --> 02:53:57.927
OF ITS WORK FOR WHILE PRIME

02:53:57.994 --> 02:53:58.995
MEDICATION. IS ON THE

02:53:59.061 --> 02:54:00.830
TRANSMISSION SIDE OF THINGS SO

02:54:00.897 --> 02:54:01.731
IT'S BEING RECORDED ON THE

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:02.899
TRANSMISSION LINE OKAY WHERE

02:54:02.965 --> 02:54:04.801
EDISON HAS TO DO THEIR WORK I

02:54:04.867 --> 02:54:06.169
BELIEVE AS A FRONT THE BEST IN

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:07.737
MY REVIEW OF THE WILDFIRE

02:54:07.804 --> 02:54:08.771
MITIGATION PLANS WITH MORE ON

02:54:08.838 --> 02:54:09.772
THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE SO IT'S

02:54:09.839 --> 02:54:12.074
JUST WHICH LINE IT GETS WRITTEN

02:54:12.141 --> 02:54:13.075
DOWN HONOR BUT THE MOTIVATORS

02:54:13.142 --> 02:54:17.380
THE SAME EITHER WAY YEAH. BUT-

02:54:17.446 --> 02:54:18.748
I'M AT BUT I THINK THAT'S A- I

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:20.716
MEAN IN MY MIND IS THAT THE SAME

02:54:20.783 --> 02:54:23.085
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE- IF WE'RE

02:54:23.152 --> 02:54:25.121
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

02:54:25.188 --> 02:54:27.523
PROBLEM BEING TRANSMISSION AND

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:32.862
DISTRIBUTION COSTS- I KNOW IT IT

02:54:32.929 --> 02:54:36.165
SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO.

02:54:36.232 --> 02:54:38.334
THE THAT I IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM

02:54:38.401 --> 02:54:39.902
FOR SO MANY YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE

02:54:39.969 --> 02:54:41.137
YOU KNOW YOU'RE CHARACTERIZING

02:54:41.204 --> 02:54:42.738
YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT

02:54:42.805 --> 02:54:44.173
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE EVER

02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:47.276
GROWING WILDFIRE- CRISIS THAT

02:54:47.343 --> 02:54:49.011
THAT IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE AND

02:54:49.078 --> 02:54:50.847
THAT THE COST NOT SHOULD. NOT

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:52.615
LIKE SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE

02:54:52.682 --> 02:54:54.150
NEED TO BUILD MORE TRANSMISSION

02:54:54.217 --> 02:54:55.852
AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:54:55.918 --> 02:54:57.386
IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE NEW

02:54:57.453 --> 02:54:59.455
CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS

02:54:59.522 --> 02:55:00.923
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:01.891
THAT THAT'S WHAT THE PC REPORT

02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:04.360
THEMSELVES SAY NOT CUT THIS

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:05.828
BAKER SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:08.264
THE HEARING OF- I. THERE IS I

02:55:08.331 --> 02:55:09.999
DON'T WANT TO MINCE WORDS SAID

02:55:10.066 --> 02:55:10.967
THERE IS NEW INVESTMENT THAT IS

02:55:11.033 --> 02:55:13.502
HAPPENING THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ON

02:55:13.569 --> 02:55:15.171
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES ON

02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:16.873
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:18.207
ON ON EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:20.509
MISTER TONY SPOKE SYDNEY DR

02:55:20.576 --> 02:55:21.711
COUNTY SPOKE TO SOME OF THESE AS

02:55:21.777 --> 02:55:25.248
WELL- AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MY

02:55:25.314 --> 02:55:27.083
OPINION IS THAT. WE GO AFTER THE

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:29.018
BIGGEST ITEM FIRST AND THE

02:55:29.085 --> 02:55:30.987
BIGGEST ITEM IS IN MY OPINION

02:55:31.053 --> 02:55:33.556
THE WILDFIRE COSTS AND THAT IT'S

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:34.156
GOING TO SHOW UP IN DIFFERENT

02:55:34.223 --> 02:55:35.992
PLACES OF THE BILL. BUT THAT'S

02:55:36.058 --> 02:55:37.093
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE

02:55:37.159 --> 02:55:38.661
BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR A

02:55:38.728 --> 02:55:40.296
ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR TAXPAYER

02:55:40.363 --> 02:55:42.098
MONEY IT MORE SOMETHING ELSE TO

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:43.866
COME IN TO PUT INTO THE PICTURE

02:55:43.933 --> 02:55:46.035
MMHM. SO GOING BACK TO. DOCTOR

02:55:46.102 --> 02:55:48.905
TONY SO- ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:51.240
ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE- SOME OF

02:55:51.307 --> 02:55:52.875
THESE COSTS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED

02:55:52.942 --> 02:55:54.844
THROUGH THE- THIS ESSAY THE

02:55:54.911 --> 02:55:56.445
GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF GOING TO

02:55:56.512 --> 02:55:59.415
RATE PAYERS. ME WHICH WOULD BE-

02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:02.985
A BETTER CANDIDATE FOR- YOU

02:56:03.052 --> 02:56:07.023
KNOW. FOR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.

02:56:07.089 --> 02:56:10.026
TO ADDRESS- WILDFIRE MITIGATION

02:56:10.092 --> 02:56:13.462
OR TRANSMISSION INDUSTRY COST.

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:15.932
SO AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK

02:56:15.998 --> 02:56:17.700
THOSE ARE THE SAME THE SAME

02:56:17.767 --> 02:56:19.168
THING THAT IT'S THE WILDFIRE

02:56:19.235 --> 02:56:21.804
COST IN WHICH LINED UP TO GO IN

02:56:21.871 --> 02:56:24.440
YOU ON THE MIDDLE. IS GOING TO

02:56:24.507 --> 02:56:26.776
BE DIFFERENT. MY BUT I THINK THE

02:56:26.842 --> 02:56:29.045
CORE OF YOUR QUESTION IS WHERE

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:29.946
DO WE GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR

02:56:30.012 --> 02:56:31.847
THE BUCK IF WE WANT TO DO A ONE

02:56:31.914 --> 02:56:32.949
TIME INVESTMENT. AND I THINK

02:56:33.015 --> 02:56:34.016
THAT'S THE WILDFIRE- THE

02:56:34.083 --> 02:56:35.384
WILDFIRE RELIEF BOTH- THE

02:56:35.451 --> 02:56:39.155
INSURANCE COST AND THE

02:56:39.221 --> 02:56:41.824
MITIGATION COSTS. AND ONLY DO I

02:56:41.891 --> 02:56:44.393
THINK IT'S THE APPROPRIATE. AND

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:45.494
JUST FROM A AN AFFORDABILITY

02:56:45.561 --> 02:56:46.529
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S

02:56:46.595 --> 02:56:48.030
APPROPRIATE JUST FROM SORT OF A

02:56:48.097 --> 02:56:51.033
FAIRNESS PERSPECTIVE- WE ARE ALL

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:53.636
PART OF. THE SAME STATE WERE ALL

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:55.338
PART OF AN EVER CHANGING

02:56:55.404 --> 02:56:57.640
CLIMATE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

02:56:57.707 --> 02:57:01.711
CLEAR TO ME THAT- BECAUSE I LIVE

02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:03.346
IN A MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT

02:57:03.412 --> 02:57:05.014
I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR A LOT.

02:57:05.081 --> 02:57:07.249
OF THE SAME WAY THAT IF I LIVE

02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:08.818
ONE TAP KERN LIVES IN AN

02:57:08.884 --> 02:57:10.152
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SERVICE

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:12.755
TERRITORY. YEP THIS IS A STATE

02:57:12.822 --> 02:57:15.491
WIDE PROBLEM AND I THINK IT

02:57:15.558 --> 02:57:19.295
REQUIRES A STATEWIDE SOLUTION-

02:57:19.362 --> 02:57:19.829
AND I THINK IT'S VERY PER

02:57:19.895 --> 02:57:21.797
PURCHASE FROM EQUITY IN FAIR

02:57:21.864 --> 02:57:22.631
PERSPECTIVE. TO LOOK TOWARDS THE

02:57:22.698 --> 02:57:24.734
TAX DOLLARS FOR THAT'S THAT TYPE

02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:26.335
OF INVESTMENT MMHM YEAH THAT

02:57:26.402 --> 02:57:28.437
THAT'S- OKAY REASONABLE PEOPLE

02:57:28.504 --> 02:57:29.572
CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I

02:57:29.638 --> 02:57:31.707
THINK PUTTING IT ON THE BACKS OF

02:57:31.774 --> 02:57:32.708
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES-

02:57:32.775 --> 02:57:34.543
CUSTOMERS IS PROBABLY THE WRONG

02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:36.245
OUTCOME. NOW RIGHT- I YEAH I

02:57:36.312 --> 02:57:38.814
APPRECIATE THAT. CLARIFICATION

02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:41.017
AND- HELPING WITH MY THINKING I

02:57:41.083 --> 02:57:42.518
GUESS WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

02:57:42.585 --> 02:57:43.786
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

02:57:43.853 --> 02:57:46.655
COSTS MEDIC. I KNOW THAT-

02:57:46.722 --> 02:57:48.858
THERE'S BEEN THERE THERE IS A

02:57:48.924 --> 02:57:50.126
LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT TO.

02:57:50.192 --> 02:57:52.161
ABOUT BUILDING OUT MORE OFFSHORE

02:57:52.228 --> 02:57:54.563
WIND CAPACITY INSTEAD OF

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:56.098
CALIFORNIA AND THE POINT WAS

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:58.734
OFTEN MADE THAT- THAT WE NEED TO

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:00.302
EXPAND OUR TRANSMISSION AND

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:02.171
DISTRIBUTION. INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:05.107
ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE NEW-

02:58:05.174 --> 02:58:09.145
OFFSHORE WIND GENERATION- I

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:10.946
THINK THE ANSWER IS YS WE WILL

02:58:11.013 --> 02:58:15.951
NEED TO DO THAT- AND AGAIN THE

02:58:16.018 --> 02:58:17.753
IF I POINT YOU BACK TO THE SLIDE

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:19.755
THAT I SHOWED YOU SORT OF A FEW

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.357
MINUTES AGO- IF YOU MAKE THE

02:58:21.424 --> 02:58:22.525
RIGHT CHOICE OF PROCUREMENT

02:58:22.591 --> 02:58:24.794
POWER- IF YOU DO THE RIGHT

02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:26.028
AMOUNT OF LOOKING A TOTAL SYSTEM

02:58:26.095 --> 02:58:27.863
COSTS AS A WAY OF CONTAINING.

02:58:27.930 --> 02:58:29.698
OVERALL SYSTEM COSTS ABOUT THE

02:58:29.765 --> 02:58:30.800
GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:33.269
PERSPECTIVE. IN KEEPING IT MORE

02:58:33.335 --> 02:58:35.204
OR LESS WHERE RATES ARE AT TODAY

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:37.573
EVEN IF WE DO A MAJOR EXPANSION

02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:39.809
OF THE GRANTED TO ACCOMMODATE

02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:41.077
ALL THE NEW ELECTRIFICATION

02:58:41.143 --> 02:58:43.679
PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SO WILL WE

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:45.915
NEED TO INVEST ACTUAL DOLLARS TO

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:46.916
MAKE THAT HAPPEN YES BUT WE'RE

02:58:46.982 --> 02:58:48.084
ALSO GOING TO INCREASE OUR USAGE

02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:49.819
AND SO THE OVERALL BALANCE I

02:58:49.885 --> 02:58:51.887
THINK WILL WILL COME OUT. AND

02:58:51.954 --> 02:58:53.556
THERE'S WAYS OF DOING THAT VERY

02:58:53.622 --> 02:58:55.658
COST EFFECTIVELY ON EDS

02:58:55.724 --> 02:58:56.492
SUPPORTED THAT OFFSHORE WIND

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:58.327
LEGISLATION LAST SESSION AND

02:58:58.394 --> 02:59:00.863
WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT I NEED TO

02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:02.598
DO A LOT MORE NEW TRANSMISSION

02:59:02.665 --> 02:59:04.100
BUILD OUT. BECAUSE WE NEED TO

02:59:04.166 --> 02:59:05.835
GET THE POWER WHERE IT'S NEEDED

02:59:05.901 --> 02:59:08.003
WHEN IT'S NEEDED IN ORDER FOR

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:09.105
CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:10.773
ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THERE ARE

02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:12.541
WAYS OF MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS

02:59:12.608 --> 02:59:14.844
THAT ARE HIGHLY COST EFFECTIVE-

02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:17.012
AND AS YOU OPEN THOSE

02:59:17.079 --> 02:59:19.048
OPPORTUNITIES- MORE CUSTOMERS

02:59:19.115 --> 02:59:20.749
GOING TO BE ABLE TO ELECTRIFY

02:59:20.816 --> 02:59:22.284
AND IT WILL COME OUT RHETT

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:24.153
RELATIVELY WELL THAT BALLOTS

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:29.458
WILL BE THERE. I DO NOTE. THERE

02:59:29.525 --> 02:59:32.995
IS NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECTLY

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:35.197
TIMED MAJOR TRANSMISSION PROJECT

02:59:35.264 --> 02:59:37.466
IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE A LITTLE

02:59:37.533 --> 02:59:39.335
BIT TOO EARLY OR A LITTLE BIT

02:59:39.401 --> 02:59:42.438
TOO LATE- IT'S REALLY HARD TO

02:59:42.505 --> 02:59:43.706
BUILD THINGS IN CALIFORNIA THE

02:59:43.772 --> 02:59:44.707
LAST MAJOR TRANSMISSION LINE

02:59:44.773 --> 02:59:46.475
TOOK SOMETHING LIKE NINE YEARS

02:59:46.542 --> 02:59:49.478
FROM START TO FINISH. AND BUT

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:51.247
EVEN IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I

02:59:51.313 --> 02:59:52.314
THINK WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:59:52.381 --> 02:59:54.517
DO RIGHT NOW IS TO SAY. LET'S

02:59:54.583 --> 02:59:56.886
FIGURE OUT WAYS OF HELPING TO

02:59:56.952 --> 02:59:59.054
BUY DOWN THE COST OF SOME OF

02:59:59.121 --> 02:59:59.855
THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT DEFERRED

02:59:59.922 --> 03:00:01.991
THE INVESTMENT. IF THERE ARE

03:00:02.057 --> 03:00:03.959
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP

03:00:04.026 --> 03:00:06.095
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS HELP DE

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:08.197
RISK IF EITHER- AS I TALKED

03:00:08.264 --> 03:00:10.566
ABOUT. A FEW MOMENTS AGO WITH-

03:00:10.633 --> 03:00:11.967
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA IF HER

03:00:12.034 --> 03:00:13.636
WAYS OF BUYING DOWN THE

03:00:13.702 --> 03:00:15.037
SHAREHOLDER RESCUE AS A MUCH

03:00:15.104 --> 03:00:17.439
MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:19.408
BUYING DOWN THE INVESTMENT. THAT

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:21.076
IS STILL BUT YOU GET THE PROJECT

03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:24.079
YOU WANT ONLINE AND ON TIME. IT

03:00:24.146 --> 03:00:24.847
ACTUALLY GIVES YOU MORE

03:00:24.914 --> 03:00:26.148
AFFORDABILITY THAN JUST SKIPPING

03:00:26.215 --> 03:00:27.917
THE PROJECT OUT RIGHT. I THINK

03:00:27.983 --> 03:00:29.685
THE BIGGEST MESSAGE THAT I WOULD

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:30.853
GIVE TO YOU OUT OF MY REMARKS

03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:33.856
THE TODAY IS DON'T SLOW DOWN.

03:00:33.923 --> 03:00:35.824
YOUR CLEAN ENERGY AGENDA UNDER

03:00:35.891 --> 03:00:37.626
THE NAME OF AFFORDABILITY MAKE

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:40.262
DIFFERENT CHOICES. ABOUT MY LAST

03:00:40.329 --> 03:00:42.665
QUESTION IS- GUY ON THE AGAIN ON

03:00:42.731 --> 03:00:44.967
THE ISSUE OF. GENERAL FUND

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:47.069
VERSES RATEPAYER DOLLARS. IN

03:00:47.136 --> 03:00:49.838
TERMS OF THE TRANSMISSION-

03:00:49.905 --> 03:00:50.873
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT

03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:52.341
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT NEW

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:55.010
OFFSHORE WIND. IS IT IS IT IS IT

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:56.979
BETTER TO PUT IT ON RATEPAYERS

03:00:57.046 --> 03:00:59.748
OR IS IT IS THAT A POSSIBLE

03:00:59.815 --> 03:01:00.749
CANDIDATE FOR GENERAL FUND

03:01:00.816 --> 03:01:07.656
DOLLARS. MY I WOULD WANT TO

03:01:07.723 --> 03:01:08.991
THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE MY

03:01:09.058 --> 03:01:11.894
PRELIMINARY. INITIAL REACTIONS

03:01:11.961 --> 03:01:13.095
HAVING RIGHT YOUR LIFE WHICH IS

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:14.463
ALWAYS SCARY TOGETHER BUT I'M

03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:16.899
GONNA DO IT ANYWAYS IS I THINK

03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:19.168
THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE TAXPAYER

03:01:19.235 --> 03:01:21.203
DOLLAR TO HELP BUY DOWN THE

03:01:21.270 --> 03:01:24.173
COST. TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT IS A

03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:25.474
MORE SECURITIZED INVESTMENTS.

03:01:25.541 --> 03:01:27.009
BUT THAT THE OVERALL KIND OF

03:01:27.076 --> 03:01:28.677
CORE PART OF THE COST IS

03:01:28.744 --> 03:01:30.012
PROBABLY STILL APPROPRIATE TO BE

03:01:30.079 --> 03:01:31.914
ASSIGNED TO RATE PAYERS. SO I

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:34.250
THINK IT IS A MATTER OF HOW DO

03:01:34.316 --> 03:01:35.351
WE LEVERAGE OUR TAXPAYER MONEY

03:01:35.417 --> 03:01:36.885
TO HELP BY DOWN OUR GRANDSON AND

03:01:36.952 --> 03:01:38.921
SENATE INTO THE SITUATION BUT I

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:41.056
DON'T THINK THAT THE TAXPAYERS

03:01:41.123 --> 03:01:43.525
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100%

03:01:43.592 --> 03:01:46.462
OF THOSE COSTS. AND THAT'S MY

03:01:46.528 --> 03:01:48.163
INITIAL THOUGHT AYE AYE IT WILL

03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:50.966
COME BACK TO YOU IF I HAVE A

03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:52.101
DIFFERENT THOUGHT IT TOO IN THE

03:01:52.167 --> 03:01:53.836
MORNING WHEN I WAS LIKE OH THIS

03:01:53.902 --> 03:01:55.638
IS HOW WE SHOULD ADVANCEMENT

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:56.872
INSTEAD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY

03:01:56.939 --> 03:01:58.173
MUCH OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU-

03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:00.509
GREAT QUESTIONS AND I JUST

03:02:00.576 --> 03:02:01.844
WANTED TO DROP IT FROM THE

03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:03.245
COMMENTS ON TRANSMISSION

03:02:03.312 --> 03:02:05.347
AFFORDABILITY THE PDF ALSO

03:02:05.414 --> 03:02:07.916
PARTICIPATED IN THE ANALYSIS.

03:02:07.983 --> 03:02:11.587
THAT WAS- IDENTIFYING CITING

03:02:11.654 --> 03:02:14.189
PERMITTING COST- AND ALL OF

03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.724
THOSE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH

03:02:15.791 --> 03:02:18.193
THAT I'M HOPING THAT- EVERY

03:02:18.260 --> 03:02:20.429
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS

03:02:20.496 --> 03:02:22.431
BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT-

03:02:22.498 --> 03:02:24.533
INFORMATION- TRYING TO REMEMBER

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:26.535
THE GROUP FOR THE COALITION

03:02:26.602 --> 03:02:28.237

WANT WAS HAVING A HEART- DONE

03:02:29.705 --> 03:02:30.839
WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE

FUND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CLEANER

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:33.909
CAST THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU I

03:02:33.976 --> 03:02:35.978
THINK THAT THAT IS TELLING- TO

03:02:36.045 --> 03:02:38.280
THE DISCUSSION THAT THE THAT

03:02:38.347 --> 03:02:39.481
THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS ALSO ENGAGE

03:02:39.548 --> 03:02:41.617
IN. AS IT RELATES TO THIS

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:43.986
MISSION. AND THE ACCESS TO COST

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:46.655
AND AFFORDABILITY THAT WE JUST

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:48.957
HAD AN EXTENSIVE THOUGHT AMOUNT

03:02:49.024 --> 03:02:50.326

03:03:51.286 --> 03:03:54.323
THAT WE REPRESENT. SEE VERY T

03:03:54.390 --> 03:03:56.458
A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.

03:03:56.525 --> 03:03:57.926
DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THE

03:03:57.993 --> 03:03:58.927
ABILITY OF PEOPLE WITH

03:03:58.994 --> 03:03:59.995
DISABILITIES TO LIVE

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:00.996
INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR

03:04:01.063 --> 03:04:02.865
COMMUNITIES WITH THE ASSISTANCE

03:04:02.931 --> 03:04:05.134
OF TECHNOLOGY. OUR ORGANIZATION

03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.302
PROVIDES DIRECT SERVICES AND

03:04:07.369 --> 03:04:08.370
WORKS ON BUILDING COMMUNITY

03:04:08.437 --> 03:04:10.105
CAPACITY TO SUPPORT ASSISTIVE

03:04:10.172 --> 03:04:12.341
TECHNOLOGY USERS AND DINNER

03:04:12.408 --> 03:04:14.076
LET'S SEE WORK WE APPETITE

03:04:14.143 --> 03:04:15.444
EXTENSIVELY BEFORE THE

03:04:15.511 --> 03:04:16.979
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

03:04:17.045 --> 03:04:19.047
COMMISSION BECAUSE ACCESS TO

03:04:19.114 --> 03:04:20.916
RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY

03:04:20.983 --> 03:04:22.918
SERVICE AND PARTICULARLY ENERGY

03:04:22.985 --> 03:04:25.053
SERVICE. IS CRUCIAL TO ALLOW

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:27.589
PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR ABILITY

03:04:27.656 --> 03:04:33.262
TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THIS

03:04:33.328 --> 03:04:34.630
GROUP OF CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS

03:04:34.696 --> 03:04:36.865
WITH DISABILITIES MEDICAL NEEDS

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:38.767
AND VULNERABILITIES MANY OF WHOM

03:04:38.834 --> 03:04:41.336
MAY NOT EVEN SELF IDENTIFY THAT

03:04:41.403 --> 03:04:43.238
WAY. THAT I WANT TO FOCUS YOUR

03:04:43.305 --> 03:04:45.541
ATTENTION ON IN THESE LAST FEW

03:04:45.607 --> 03:04:47.843
MINUTES THIS AFTERNOON. THESE

03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:51.947
CUSTOMERS RELY ON ELECTRICITY.

03:04:52.014 --> 03:04:53.916
TO POWER ASSISTIVE DEVICES SOME

03:04:53.982 --> 03:04:56.318
OF WHICH ARE DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY

03:04:56.385 --> 03:04:58.020
MEDICAL IN NATURE LIKE CHARGING

03:04:58.086 --> 03:05:00.456
POWER WHEELCHAIRS ARE POWERED

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:02.858
RESPIRATORS. SOME ARE LESS

03:05:02.925 --> 03:05:04.460
OBVIOUS BUT EQUALLY VITAL THE

03:05:04.526 --> 03:05:06.829
PERSON WITH DIABETES WHO RELIES

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:08.897
ON INSULIN. NEEDS THE

03:05:08.964 --> 03:05:10.466
REFRIGERATOR FUNCTION FOR THEIR

03:05:10.532 --> 03:05:12.267
INSULIN TO STAY POTENT AND IF

03:05:12.334 --> 03:05:14.269
THEY LOSE ACCESS TO POWER FOR

03:05:14.336 --> 03:05:16.071
THE REFRIGERATOR NOT ONLY WILL

03:05:16.138 --> 03:05:18.106
THEY SUFFER HEALTH IMPACTS BUT

03:05:18.173 --> 03:05:21.310
ALSO COSTS IF THEY LOSE ACCESS

03:05:21.376 --> 03:05:23.212
TO THEIR MEDICATION. PEOPLE WITH

03:05:23.278 --> 03:05:25.547
DISABILITIES TEND TO USE HIGH

03:05:25.614 --> 03:05:28.283
LEVELS OF ELECTRICITY. ARE ALSO

03:05:28.350 --> 03:05:30.252
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME.

03:05:30.319 --> 03:05:31.753
THIS MEANS THAT INCREASING

03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:34.389
ELECTRICITY RATES PUTS AN EXTRA

03:05:34.456 --> 03:05:36.992
BURDEN ON THIS CONSTITUENCY. AND

03:05:37.059 --> 03:05:39.061
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE COSTS

03:05:39.127 --> 03:05:40.462
IT'S EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:42.331
CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS WHO ARE AT

03:05:42.397 --> 03:05:45.167
THE EXTREMES BOTH IN TERMS OF

03:05:45.234 --> 03:05:46.969
THEIR USE. THEIR INCOME AND

03:05:47.035 --> 03:05:48.937
THEIR ABILITY TO ADAPT THEIR

03:05:49.004 --> 03:05:51.673
ABILITY TO INSTALL WHO TOP SOLAR

03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:53.442
OR TO PURCHASE AN ELECTRIC

03:05:53.509 --> 03:05:54.776
VEHICLE IS PROBABLY LOWER THAN

03:05:54.843 --> 03:05:56.712
AVERAGE AND THERE'S A RISK THAT

03:05:56.778 --> 03:05:59.047
THEY'LL BE LEFT BEHIND AS A

03:05:59.114 --> 03:06:00.582
LET'S SEE MAKERS DEVELOP

03:06:00.649 --> 03:06:02.050
INCENTIVES TO MOVE TOWARDS

03:06:02.117 --> 03:06:03.986
CLEANER ELECTRICITY. UNLESS

03:06:04.052 --> 03:06:06.188
THERE'S A LOT OF CARE GIVEN TO

03:06:06.255 --> 03:06:09.858
HOW TO ASSIST THOSE WHO MIGHT BE

03:06:09.925 --> 03:06:12.261
LEFT BEHIND. UNDER SOME PROGRAMS

03:06:12.327 --> 03:06:13.962
THAT ARE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY

03:06:14.029 --> 03:06:15.397
TOWARDS THIS POPULATION

03:06:15.464 --> 03:06:16.632
INCLUDING THE MEDICAL BASELINE

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:19.501
PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THIS

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:21.470
PROGRAM ISN'T WELL KNOWN AND

03:06:21.537 --> 03:06:23.739
IT'S UNDER UTILIZED. BEEN RECENT

03:06:23.805 --> 03:06:25.107
EFFORTS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT

03:06:25.173 --> 03:06:28.043
WHICH ARE WELCOME- BUT NOT

03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:30.145
SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

03:06:30.212 --> 03:06:33.081
THESE CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY

03:06:33.148 --> 03:06:34.683
THERE'S TALK ABOUT USING RATES

03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:37.352
AND RATE DESIGN TO PROVIDE

03:06:37.419 --> 03:06:37.986
INCENTIVES FOR CUSTOMER

03:06:38.053 --> 03:06:39.955
BEHAVIOR. I THINK THIS IS A

03:06:40.022 --> 03:06:42.057
CRUCIAL PIECE OF THE PROBLEMS

03:06:42.124 --> 03:06:43.759
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.

03:06:43.825 --> 03:06:45.527
BUT AGAIN NOT EVERY CUSTOMER IS

03:06:45.594 --> 03:06:47.396
GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:49.031
RATE SIGNALS THAT ARE SENT AND

03:06:49.097 --> 03:06:51.066
SO CARE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO

03:06:51.133 --> 03:06:52.734
PROTECT THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:55.103
THE ABILITY TO SHIFT THE TIME

03:06:55.170 --> 03:06:55.671
THAT THEY CHARGE THEIR POWER

03:06:55.737 --> 03:06:57.239
WHEELCHAIR SO THAT IT'S OUTSIDE

03:06:57.306 --> 03:06:58.941
OF PEAK HOURS OR TAKE OTHER

03:06:59.007 --> 03:07:02.477
ACTIONS THAT MIGHT. BE WHAT A

03:07:02.544 --> 03:07:04.246
POLICYMAKERS WANT TO ENCOURAGE

03:07:04.313 --> 03:07:06.381
BUT MAY NOT WORK FOR INDIVIDUAL

03:07:06.448 --> 03:07:10.285
USERS. THE NEED FOR ACCESS TO

03:07:10.352 --> 03:07:12.287
AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ENERGY

03:07:12.354 --> 03:07:13.889
IS A CRUCIAL MATTER OF HEALTH

03:07:13.956 --> 03:07:15.891
AND SAFETY PARTICULARLY FOR THE

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:18.694
MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS. IN MY

03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:19.695
CONSTITUENCY DRIVES THIS POINT

03:07:19.761 --> 03:07:23.966
HOME. SOME EXAMPLES. WELL BEFORE

03:07:24.032 --> 03:07:24.800
THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE

03:07:24.866 --> 03:07:27.502
PANDEMIC MY ORGANIZATION BURKE

03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:28.870
REGULAR CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE

03:07:28.937 --> 03:07:30.939
WHO LINGERED UNCOMFORTABLE AND

03:07:31.006 --> 03:07:32.541
EVEN UNSAFE TEMPERATURES IN OUR

03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:34.343
HOMES BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

03:07:34.409 --> 03:07:36.445
AFFORD THE COSTS OF HEATING OR

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:38.347
COOLING. MOST ACCORDING. WHAT

03:07:38.413 --> 03:07:40.716
PEOPLE FORCED TO SPEND MORE TIME

03:07:40.782 --> 03:07:42.651
AT HOME BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC.

03:07:42.718 --> 03:07:44.820
AND UNABLE TO LOOK UP MOVE TO

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:45.821
PUBLIC PLACES WITH AIR

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:47.289
CONDITIONING DURING TIMES OF

03:07:47.356 --> 03:07:49.791
EXTREME HEAT. THIS HAS BEEN AN

03:07:49.858 --> 03:07:50.926
INCREASED RISK AND IT WILL

03:07:50.993 --> 03:07:52.461
CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITH

03:07:52.527 --> 03:07:54.329
CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS

03:07:54.396 --> 03:07:56.198
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR

03:07:56.264 --> 03:07:57.633
PEOPLE WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS

03:07:57.699 --> 03:08:00.469
THAT REQUIRE THEM TO MAINTAIN A

03:08:00.535 --> 03:08:02.371
NARROW RANGE OF TEMPERATURES.

03:08:02.437 --> 03:08:04.973
SIMILARLY WELL BEFORE THE

03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:06.508
BEGINNING OF THE COPA PANDEMIC.

03:08:06.575 --> 03:08:08.343
MY ORGANIZATION HEARD REGULAR

03:08:08.410 --> 03:08:09.444
CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WOULD

03:08:09.511 --> 03:08:10.946
HAVE TO SACRIFICE OTHER

03:08:11.013 --> 03:08:14.216
NECESSITIES SO THAT THEY COULD

03:08:14.282 --> 03:08:15.584
PAY THEIR POWER BILLS. YOU CAN

03:08:15.651 --> 03:08:17.185
GO WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE THEY

03:08:17.252 --> 03:08:19.054
DON'T FILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS

03:08:19.121 --> 03:08:19.988
THEY DON'T USE

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:22.057
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES EVEN

03:08:22.124 --> 03:08:24.226
GO WITHOUT FOOD TO KEEP THEIR

03:08:24.292 --> 03:08:26.995
POWER. THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE

03:08:27.062 --> 03:08:29.531
FEDERAL HOUSING SUBSIDIES IF

03:08:29.598 --> 03:08:30.532
THEIR POWER IS TURNED OFF FOR

03:08:30.599 --> 03:08:32.901
NON PAYMENT THEIR FIRST HAVING

03:08:32.968 --> 03:08:34.569
THEIR KIDS TAKE IT AWAY.

03:08:34.636 --> 03:08:36.838
CUSTOMERS WHO ARE AT RISK MAKE

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:38.874
TERRIBLE CHOICES TO KEEP THE

03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:42.978
POWER BOX. WITH COATED IN PEOPLE

03:08:43.045 --> 03:08:43.879
BEING FORCED TO SPEND MORE TIME

03:08:43.945 --> 03:08:45.614
AT HOME THESE PRE EXISTING

03:08:45.681 --> 03:08:49.751
CONCERNS SEVEN BEEN ACTIVATED.

03:08:49.818 --> 03:08:50.786
PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL LONGER

03:08:50.852 --> 03:08:52.454
ABILITIES ARE ARE ALSO AT

03:08:52.521 --> 03:08:53.989
INCREASED DIRECT RISKS DURING

03:08:54.056 --> 03:08:55.824
THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:57.659
MOST LIKELY TO HAVE- HAVE THE

03:08:57.726 --> 03:09:00.128
WORST OUTCOMES IF THEY IN FACT

03:09:00.195 --> 03:09:02.698
GET SICK. FOR THESE POPULATIONS

03:09:02.764 --> 03:09:04.733
THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN WORK

03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:06.835
AND SCHOOL TELL HEALTH AND

03:09:06.902 --> 03:09:09.871
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES ALL VIRTUALLY

03:09:09.938 --> 03:09:12.741
CONTINUES TO BE VITAL. AND NOW

03:09:12.808 --> 03:09:14.409
AS THE STATE IS MOVING AWAY FROM

03:09:14.476 --> 03:09:16.411
SOME BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS

03:09:16.478 --> 03:09:17.379
AND TOWARDS INDIVIDUAL

03:09:17.446 --> 03:09:18.847
RESPONSIBILITY TO MEDICATE

03:09:18.914 --> 03:09:20.949
COVERT PRESS THE COSTS OF

03:09:21.016 --> 03:09:23.385
REMAINING AT HOME INCLUDING

03:09:23.452 --> 03:09:25.454
INCREASED ENERGY USE. CONTINUE

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:27.389
TO BE A CONCERN FOR THE

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:29.958
CUSTOMERS WHO FACE THESE CHOICES

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:32.027
. AND FINALLY THE LIABILITY IS

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:33.795
ALSO A KEY CONCERN FOR PEOPLE

03:09:33.862 --> 03:09:35.997
WHO DEPEND ON POWER FOR THEIR

03:09:36.064 --> 03:09:37.499
HEALTH AND SAFETY. YOU TELL IT

03:09:37.566 --> 03:09:39.568
IS RELIANCE ON FIVE G. IN

03:09:39.634 --> 03:09:42.037
CREATION AND POWER SHUT OFFS AS

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:43.805
PART OF A WILDFIRE MITIGATION

03:09:43.872 --> 03:09:47.509
STRATEGY. INCREASES THE RISK OF

03:09:47.576 --> 03:09:50.278
HARM TO THESE POPULATIONS. SO

03:09:50.345 --> 03:09:51.980
THESE ARE THE CUSTOMERS I WANT

03:09:52.047 --> 03:09:52.848
TO HIGHLIGHT THESE LAST FEW

03:09:52.914 --> 03:09:54.783
MINUTES. IN THE BOOK THAT THE

03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:56.118
BACKGROUND PAPER PRESENTED

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:58.587
TODAY- MAKES CLEAR THAT

03:09:58.653 --> 03:10:00.021
CUSTOMERS ARE EXPERIENCING BILL

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:02.224
INCREASES EVEN IF THEIR ENERGY

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:05.794
USAGE ISN'T NECESSARILY CHANGING

03:10:05.861 --> 03:10:06.828
. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S

03:10:06.895 --> 03:10:08.396
REASONS TO MOVE AWAY FROM

03:10:08.463 --> 03:10:10.766
VOLUMETRIC BILLS- AND MOVE

03:10:10.832 --> 03:10:14.336
TOWARDS THINGS LIKE EXTRACTIONS-

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:15.737
THE RISKS TO THESE CUSTOMERS

03:10:15.804 --> 03:10:17.472
EVEN GREATER. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

03:10:17.539 --> 03:10:19.741
REDUCE THOSE PORTIONS OF THEIR

03:10:19.808 --> 03:10:21.376
BILL FOR CONSERVATION. FOR

03:10:21.443 --> 03:10:23.678
CUSTOMERS WHOSE USAGE IS LOW

03:10:23.745 --> 03:10:25.947
CHANGES IN RATE STRUCTURE RISK

03:10:26.014 --> 03:10:27.916
INCREASES IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO

03:10:27.983 --> 03:10:30.118
PAY WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING

03:10:30.185 --> 03:10:34.589
BENEFITS. SO WHAT CAN THE

03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:38.026
LEGISLATURE DO UP WITH V. UP

03:10:38.093 --> 03:10:40.829
INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE THAT I

03:10:40.896 --> 03:10:42.798
REPRESENT IN MIND. THE PUBLIC

03:10:42.864 --> 03:10:44.299
UTILITIES COMMISSION IS CHARGED

03:10:44.366 --> 03:10:45.901
WITH ENSURING THAT ELECTRICITY

03:10:45.967 --> 03:10:48.103
RATES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE.

03:10:48.170 --> 03:10:50.472
AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE A

03:10:50.539 --> 03:10:52.207
PARTNER IN WORKING TO MAKE SURE

03:10:52.274 --> 03:10:54.442
THAT MY CONSTITUENCIES NEEDS ARE

03:10:54.509 --> 03:10:56.745
PART OF THAT EQUATION. THE

03:10:56.812 --> 03:10:58.647
LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE CLEAR THAT

03:10:58.713 --> 03:11:00.415
CONSIDERATION OF AFFORDABILITY

03:11:00.482 --> 03:11:03.318
BILL FORD ABILITY IS PART OF THE

03:11:03.385 --> 03:11:05.353
CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER RATES

03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:07.255
ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. THAT

03:11:07.322 --> 03:11:08.590
MAY SEEM COMMONSENSE BUT IT'S

03:11:08.657 --> 03:11:10.192
NOT PART OF THE COMMISSION'S

03:11:10.258 --> 03:11:12.460
EQUATION AT THIS TIME. BUT

03:11:12.527 --> 03:11:14.830
MAKING THAT CLEAR MIGHT ASSIST

03:11:14.896 --> 03:11:16.231
THE COMMISSION IN DEVELOPING

03:11:16.298 --> 03:11:18.233
RATE STRUCTURES THAT TAKE INTO

03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:19.968
ACCOUNT THE CHALLENGES FACING

03:11:20.035 --> 03:11:22.170
THE MOST VULNERABLE AND LOW

03:11:22.237 --> 03:11:24.239
INCOME CUSTOMER GROUPS. THIS MAY

03:11:24.306 --> 03:11:25.841
INCLUDE SOME SUGGESTIONS THE

03:11:25.907 --> 03:11:27.742
DOCTOR TONY SPOKE OF EARLIER

03:11:27.809 --> 03:11:28.977
SUCH AS INCLUDING REVIEW OF

03:11:29.044 --> 03:11:30.712
CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF RATE

03:11:30.779 --> 03:11:33.148
INCREASES REQUESTED BY UTILITIES

03:11:33.215 --> 03:11:34.916
AND SETTING POTENTIAL LIMITS ON

03:11:34.983 --> 03:11:38.053
THE INCREASE. THE LEGISLATURE

03:11:38.119 --> 03:11:39.921
CAN ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

03:11:39.988 --> 03:11:42.557
DIRECT RELIEF TO CUSTOMERS WHO

03:11:42.624 --> 03:11:44.593
ACCUMULATED ARREARS REACHES

03:11:44.659 --> 03:11:46.728
DURING THE KOPET PANDEMIC. THE

03:11:46.795 --> 03:11:48.897
DEBT RELIEF THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY

03:11:48.964 --> 03:11:50.031
BEEN AUTHORIZED IS ONLY EXPECTED

03:11:50.098 --> 03:11:52.300
TO COVER 38% OF THE CUSTOMER

03:11:52.367 --> 03:11:54.769
DEBT INCURRED. WELL THIS IS AN

03:11:54.836 --> 03:11:56.204
ENORMOUS HELP IT DOESN'T SOLVE

03:11:56.271 --> 03:11:58.940
THE PROBLEM OF CUSTOMER DATA AT

03:11:59.007 --> 03:12:00.909
THIS TIME. BUT THERE'S BEEN

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:03.044
EXTENSIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT COST

03:12:03.111 --> 03:12:04.946
THAT COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF RATES

03:12:05.013 --> 03:12:06.982
AND COVERED THROUGH OTHER

03:12:07.048 --> 03:12:09.084
ASPECTS OF THE STATE BUDGET. US

03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:10.919
CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:12.587
ADDS TO THE VOICES SUGGESTING

03:12:12.654 --> 03:12:14.389
THAT WILDFIRE MITIGATION WOULD

03:12:14.456 --> 03:12:17.893
BE APPROPRIATE- AS A ONE AS ONE

03:12:17.959 --> 03:12:19.594
TIME EXPENDITURES THAT COULD BE

03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:21.563
PAID BY TAXPAYERS RATHER THAN

03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:24.032
RATEPAYERS. THIS WOULD HAVE

03:12:24.099 --> 03:12:26.301
ADDITIONAL RIPPLE EFFECT BEYOND

03:12:26.368 --> 03:12:27.702
THE BENEFITS SPOKEN OF

03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:30.205
PREVIOUSLY IN THAT STATE

03:12:30.272 --> 03:12:32.340
INVESTMENT WOULD NOT ADD TO THE

03:12:32.407 --> 03:12:34.776
UTILITY RATE BASE AND SO THE

03:12:34.843 --> 03:12:37.245
COSTS OF THE STATE INVESTMENTS

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:38.747
WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE

03:12:38.813 --> 03:12:41.616
UTILITIES UP COST. THE RATE OF

03:12:41.683 --> 03:12:44.286
RETURN. SO THAT WOULD BE NOT

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:45.687
JUST THE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF

03:12:45.754 --> 03:12:47.455
PUTTING COSTS ON TAXPAYERS

03:12:47.522 --> 03:12:49.157
RATHER THAN RATEPAYERS BUT IT

03:12:49.224 --> 03:12:51.493
WOULD COULD DECREASE COSTS

03:12:51.559 --> 03:12:53.862
MOVING FORWARD. JENNIFER

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:55.463
ACCEPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ALSO

03:12:55.530 --> 03:12:57.999
SUPPORTS A BROADER FUNDING OF

TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

03:13:00.035 --> 03:13:01.169
AND WE THINK THAT THERE ARE

03:13:01.236 --> 03:13:02.570
INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS WHETHER

03:13:02.637 --> 03:13:04.873
THAT'S CORRECT. BUT CASHIER

03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:08.410
FUNDING FOR A TRANSPORTATION

03:13:08.476 --> 03:13:10.312
SECTOR FUNDING. WE DO NOT

03:13:10.378 --> 03:13:13.315
SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF LOW

03:13:13.381 --> 03:13:15.016
INCOME SUBSIDIES THE CARE AND

03:13:15.083 --> 03:13:18.086
FERRE PROGRAM OUT OF REPAIR

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:20.956
SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE

03:13:21.022 --> 03:13:23.091
LIE HE PROGRAM IS AN UNFORTUNATE

03:13:23.158 --> 03:13:25.527
EXAMPLE OF A LOW INCOME SUBSIDY

03:13:25.593 --> 03:13:26.928
THAT HAS BEEN USED AS A

03:13:26.995 --> 03:13:28.430
POLITICAL FOOTBALL YEAR UPON

03:13:28.496 --> 03:13:31.132
YEAR AND FUNDING FOR THAT

03:13:31.199 --> 03:13:32.634
PROGRAM ISNEVER SHARED. THAT

03:13:32.701 --> 03:13:33.868
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO

03:13:33.935 --> 03:13:36.671
DEPEND ON CARE CAN'T HAVE A

03:13:36.738 --> 03:13:37.973
SITUATION LIKE THAT WHICH IS

03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:41.710
FACED BY CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON

03:13:41.776 --> 03:13:49.050
THE LIGHT HE- SO THE THESE ARE

03:13:49.117 --> 03:13:51.519
THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR A LOT OF-

03:13:51.586 --> 03:13:53.488
CREATIVE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:55.190
FUND IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT

03:13:55.256 --> 03:13:56.858
SHARE GARCIA I APPRECIATE YOUR

03:13:56.925 --> 03:13:59.027
QUESTIONS ABOUT REVIEW OF OTHER

03:13:59.094 --> 03:14:01.763
COMMISSION OF MANAGED PROGRAMS

03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:03.798
AND- WHILE I HAVEN'T DONE AN

03:14:03.865 --> 03:14:05.900
EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THIS TIME I

03:14:05.967 --> 03:14:07.602
WOULD WELCOME RECONIDERATION OF

03:14:07.669 --> 03:14:10.205
CERTAIN PROGRAMS- THAT HAVE BEEN

03:14:10.271 --> 03:14:12.374
AROUND FOR AWHILE TO SEE WHETHER

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:13.241
THEY'RE STILL ACHIEVING THE

03:14:13.308 --> 03:14:14.943
GOALS THAT THEY WERE INITIALLY

03:14:15.010 --> 03:14:16.644
INTENDED FOR. WE KNOW FROM

03:14:16.711 --> 03:14:18.380
CONDEMN EXAMPLE THAT IT'S MUCH

03:14:18.446 --> 03:14:20.415
HARDER TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM

03:14:20.482 --> 03:14:22.017
THAT EXISTS THAN IT IS TO CREATE

03:14:22.083 --> 03:14:24.185
A NEW PROGRAM- SO LOOKING WITH

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:28.857
FRESH EYES MIGHT BE A USEFUL

03:14:28.923 --> 03:14:30.759
TASK TO UNDERTAKE. AND FINALLY

03:14:30.825 --> 03:14:32.260
THE LEGISLATURE CAN ADDRESS THE

03:14:32.327 --> 03:14:33.962
IMPORTANCE OF SHAREHOLDER

03:14:34.029 --> 03:14:36.031
CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFFORDABILITY

03:14:36.097 --> 03:14:39.100
SOLUTIONS. YEAH YOU JUST LIKE TO

03:14:39.167 --> 03:14:40.368
SAY BEFORE THE COMMISSION THAT

03:14:40.435 --> 03:14:42.203
WERE ALL IN THE CURRENT CRISIS

03:14:42.270 --> 03:14:43.772
TOGETHER BUT THEY ACTIVELY

03:14:43.838 --> 03:14:46.041
RESIST MOST EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE

03:14:46.107 --> 03:14:47.842
SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS SO

03:14:47.909 --> 03:14:50.245
WHETHER THIS IS THREE RETURN ON

03:14:50.311 --> 03:14:52.814
EQUITY- THE EVALUATIONS- OR

03:14:52.881 --> 03:14:55.150
OTHER MEANS MAKING SURE THAT

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:56.518
SHAREHOLDERS ARE PART OF THE

03:14:56.584 --> 03:14:58.586
PROBLEM I'M SORRY. PART OF PART

03:14:58.653 --> 03:15:02.957
OF THE SOLUTION- IT IS AN

03:15:03.024 --> 03:15:04.192
IMPORTANT STEP TO TAKE. MY LAST

03:15:04.259 --> 03:15:06.861
RECOMMENDATION BUT IS LOOKING

03:15:06.928 --> 03:15:09.898
AT- THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT

03:15:09.964 --> 03:15:11.866
THAT ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES OF

03:15:11.933 --> 03:15:13.701
ELECTRICITY MUST BE AFFORDABLE

03:15:13.768 --> 03:15:15.603
TO CUSTOMERS. RIGHT NOW THAT

03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:19.007
SECTION THREE EIGHTY TO BE IF

THE COMMISSION IS AWARE THAT

03:15:22.177 --> 03:15:22.744
ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES OF

03:15:22.811 --> 03:15:24.212
ELECTRICITY IT REQUIRED TO BE

03:15:24.279 --> 03:15:26.481
AFFORDABLE. BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN

03:15:26.548 --> 03:15:28.349
TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT OTHERS

03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:31.286
ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES ACTUALLY ARE.

03:15:31.352 --> 03:15:32.687
THE COMMISSION HAS AUTHORIZED TO

03:15:32.754 --> 03:15:34.656

03:15:34.722 --> 03:15:36.291
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU SAID

ESSENTIAL USAGE IS LIKELY TO

03:15:47.869 --> 03:15:49.771
CHANGE RAPIDLY SO IT MIGHT BE

03:15:49.838 --> 03:15:51.639
HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:15:54.008 --> 03:15:55.610
A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

IT MEANS TO EVALUATE THE USAGE

03:15:57.479 --> 03:15:59.481

KEEPING IT VERY BRIEF NOTES A

03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:51.759
LONG DAY- I THINK WE KNOW IT'S-

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:52.961
CLEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:17:53.027 --> 03:17:54.495
HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM

03:17:54.562 --> 03:17:56.331
GOALS CARBON NEUTRALITY SB ONE

03:17:56.397 --> 03:17:58.066
HUNDRED. AND THOSE ARE NOT GOING

03:17:58.132 --> 03:17:59.767
TO BE FREE SO I THINK THE REAL

03:17:59.834 --> 03:18:00.835
QUESTION YOU GUYS TOUCH ON TODAY

03:18:00.902 --> 03:18:03.037
IS WHO SHOULD PAY. AND ARE THERE

03:18:03.104 --> 03:18:05.006
WAYS TO KIND OF REDUCED RATES AS

03:18:05.073 --> 03:18:06.708
WE ALECTRA FI I THINK THIS CAN

03:18:06.774 --> 03:18:08.843
BE ONE THE CORE THEMES OF THE

03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:09.944
NEXT YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS IN

03:18:10.011 --> 03:18:10.945
THE STATE IS ELECTRIFYING OUR

03:18:11.012 --> 03:18:12.914
STATE'S ECONOMY. I THINK WE

03:18:12.981 --> 03:18:13.915
REALLY DO AGREE WITH WHAT WE

03:18:13.982 --> 03:18:15.016
HEARD FROM EDF AND MICHAEL

03:18:15.083 --> 03:18:16.818
COLVIN ABOUT THE NEED TO LOOK AT

03:18:16.884 --> 03:18:18.553
ENERGY SHARE OF WALLET THERE

03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:20.154
THAT FROM OUR OWN ANALYSIS AND

03:18:20.221 --> 03:18:21.289
THEIR RESOURCES BOARD IS DOING

03:18:21.356 --> 03:18:23.558
THE SAME. YOU CAN HAVE INCREASES

03:18:23.625 --> 03:18:24.859
IN ELECTRIC RATES MAYBE EVEN

03:18:24.926 --> 03:18:26.894
INCREASES ELECTRIC BILLS BUT THE

03:18:26.961 --> 03:18:28.196
SAME TIME IF YOU'RE REDUCING

03:18:28.263 --> 03:18:29.964
YOUR USAGE OF GASOLINE OR

03:18:30.031 --> 03:18:32.567
NATURAL GAS YOUR TOTAL SPEND THE

03:18:32.634 --> 03:18:34.002
TOTAL SPEND YOUR HOUSEHOLD AS ON

03:18:34.068 --> 03:18:35.870
ENERGY COULD BE REDUCED AND IF

03:18:35.937 --> 03:18:38.273
WE LOOK AT OUR ANALYSIS WHICH IS

03:18:38.339 --> 03:18:39.941
PUBLIC. GO OUT TO TWENTY FORTY

03:18:40.008 --> 03:18:42.076
FIVE WE SEE AN INCLUDING

03:18:42.143 --> 03:18:42.877
INFLATION ALL THOSE AT ALL THE

03:18:42.944 --> 03:18:44.946
REST- ONE THIRD REDUCTION IN

03:18:45.013 --> 03:18:46.781
TOTAL ENERGY SPEND THE MONEY

03:18:46.848 --> 03:18:48.583
AMONG HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING

03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:51.119
CARBON. NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY

03:18:51.185 --> 03:18:51.886
FORTY FIVE SO I THINK THERE'S

03:18:51.953 --> 03:18:53.821
LIKE WE HEARD BEFORE YOU CAN

03:18:53.888 --> 03:18:54.922

03:19:08.336 --> 03:19:09.003
THROUGH NUMBERS FAST THAT IT

03:19:09.070 --> 03:19:10.305
WOULD ONLY SUPPORT TEN THOUSAND

03:19:10.371 --> 03:19:11.739
HOUSEHOLDS. WERE ACTUALLY OUR

03:19:11.806 --> 03:19:13.808

BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITY

03:19:14.909 --> 03:19:16.844
COMMISSION WOULD INSTALL TWO

SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER. AND IN

03:19:25.053 --> 03:19:26.187
FACT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:19:26.254 --> 03:19:27.622
HOUSEHOLDS WILL RECEIVE PANEL

03:19:27.689 --> 03:19:29.290
UPGRADE SO IT'S A LOT BIGGER

03:19:29.357 --> 03:19:30.758

03:20:08.463 --> 03:20:10.631
THOSE CAN BE- A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:20:10.698 --> 03:20:12.033
LONGER TERM BUT THEY'RE

03:20:12.100 --> 03:20:13.034
IMPORTANT LIKE THAT WHAT WAS

03:20:13.101 --> 03:20:15.503
BROUGHT UP TODAY ABOUT FIXED

A LETTER CAN GAS SIDE FOR

03:22:01.742 --> 03:22:03.611
ELECTRIC COSTS IN THIS STATE.

03:22:03.678 --> 03:22:05.980
BUT I ALSO WANT TO. TELL YOU

03:22:06.047 --> 03:22:07.915
THAT SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE

03:22:07.982 --> 03:22:09.116
LEARNED DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS

03:22:09.183 --> 03:22:11.152
WAS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:14.522
CONTROL THOSE COSTS. IS LIMITED

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:16.657
BY THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING

03:22:16.724 --> 03:22:19.227
THE REGULATION. SO I WANT TO

03:22:19.293 --> 03:22:21.429
FOCUS ON WHAT I EMPHASIZE. THE

03:22:21.496 --> 03:22:24.532
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE STATE

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:27.134
AND THE FEDS SO FOR EXAMPLE

03:22:27.201 --> 03:22:29.670
TRANSMISSION COSTS THE FEDERAL

03:22:29.737 --> 03:22:31.873
ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION-

03:22:31.939 --> 03:22:35.142
CONTROLS THOSE COSTS AND IS

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:36.544
EXTREMELY GENEROUS WITH

03:22:36.611 --> 03:22:38.279
CALIFORNIA RATEPAYER DOLLARS IN

03:22:38.346 --> 03:22:40.848
A WAY THAT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

03:22:40.915 --> 03:22:43.818
CLARIFY. THAT IS TO SOME EXTENT

03:22:43.885 --> 03:22:45.786
A QUESTION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP

03:22:45.853 --> 03:22:46.854
WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT

03:22:46.921 --> 03:22:49.624
SYSTEM OPERATOR WHICH IS A

03:22:49.690 --> 03:22:50.525
CALIFORNIA. NONPROFIT

03:22:50.591 --> 03:22:52.426
CORPORATION SUBJECT TO

03:22:52.493 --> 03:22:54.862
CALIFORNIA CONTROL BUT WHICH IS

03:22:54.929 --> 03:22:56.797
AT THIS POINT IN CONTROL OF

03:22:56.864 --> 03:23:00.434
WHOLESALE ENERGY MARKETS ONE AND

03:23:00.501 --> 03:23:02.270
TWO TRANSMISSION COSTS IN

03:23:02.336 --> 03:23:04.305
CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO TAKE A

03:23:04.372 --> 03:23:06.340
VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THAT AND YOU

03:23:06.407 --> 03:23:08.276
NEED TO HAVE A VERY SHARP PENCIL

03:23:08.342 --> 03:23:10.044
ON THOSE TRANSMISSION COST. GIVE

03:23:10.111 --> 03:23:11.913
YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE. MISTER

03:23:11.979 --> 03:23:14.248
CORK INDICATED THAT OVER THE

03:23:14.315 --> 03:23:17.218
LAST. IN IN IN A QUESTION OVER

03:23:17.285 --> 03:23:19.086
THE LAST TEN YEARS. INVESTMENT

03:23:19.153 --> 03:23:20.721
IN TRANSMISSION AS THE SINGER

03:23:20.788 --> 03:23:22.823
FROM DISTRIBUTION HAS MORE THAN

03:23:22.890 --> 03:23:23.991
DOUBLED FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:23:24.058 --> 03:23:25.893
EDISON SAID AND SAN DIEGO GAS

03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.995
AND ELECTRIC THAT'S BECAUSE THE

03:23:28.062 --> 03:23:30.631
PROFITS AVAILABLE FROM FIRST

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:32.600
REGULATION ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:34.168
GREATER THAN THEY ARE UNDER

03:23:34.235 --> 03:23:36.103
CALIFORNIA. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:40.741
EDISON I HAS A DIFFERENT-

03:23:40.808 --> 03:23:42.577
SEPARATION BETWEEN TRANSMISSION

03:23:42.643 --> 03:23:44.612
AND DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION AS

03:23:44.679 --> 03:23:46.147
STATE JURISDICTIONAL AND

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:47.214
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON'S

03:23:47.281 --> 03:23:48.549
TRANSMISSION BECAUSE HAVE GREAT

03:23:48.616 --> 03:23:50.918
HAVE INCREASED AT A MUCH SLOWER

03:23:50.985 --> 03:23:52.687
RATE. AND HAVE THE OTHER

03:23:52.753 --> 03:23:57.024
UTILITIES SO THAT ISSUE OF STATE

03:23:57.091 --> 03:23:58.793
CONTROL OVER THE CALIFORNIA ISO

03:23:58.859 --> 03:24:00.995
IS SO YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK

03:24:01.062 --> 03:24:03.397
AT. SECOND I WANNA. EMPHASIZED

03:24:03.464 --> 03:24:05.066
REEMPHASIZE CINEMARK TONY SAID

03:24:05.132 --> 03:24:07.101
WHICH IS TRANSPARENCY OF COSTS

FORTH IT. ARE YOU NEED TO

03:24:18.512 --> 03:24:20.615
INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF

03:36:46.626 --> 03:36:48.328
AWAY FROM THEIR MANY DECISIONS

03:36:48.395 --> 03:36:49.996
THAT CONTRIBUTED MUCH MORE TO

HARDSHIP RELATED TO ROOFTOP

03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:06.012
SOLAR IS TINY AND TO FOCUS ON

03:37:06.079 --> 03:37:07.581
THAT IS THE PROBLEM IS

03:37:07.647 --> 03:37:09.549
DISINGENUOUS AND ABHORRENT HE%

TOTAL GROSS LOADING OF THE

03:40:55.475 --> 03:40:57.210
ELECTRIC SYSTEM HAS GONE DOWN

03:40:57.277 --> 03:40:59.512
ELECTRIC RATES HAVE CONTINUED TO

03:40:59.579 --> 03:41:00.914
SKYROCKET AND IF YOU BREAK THAT

03:41:00.981 --> 03:41:02.749
DOWN FURTHER THE ACTUAL RATE OF

03:41:02.816 --> 03:41:04.684
ENERGY IS LESS THAN THE COST TO

03:41:04.751 --> 03:41:06.853
TRANSMIT TRANSMITTING THAT

03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:08.922
ENERGY AND THAT COMES FACE TO

03:41:08.989 --> 03:41:10.857
FACE WITH YOU TOLD A CONFLICT OF

03:41:17.530 --> 03:41:22.135
IN FACT THIRTY TO FIFTY YEAR

03:41:22.202 --> 03:41:22.736
HELLO IT GETTING DOUBLE DIGIT

03:41:22.802 --> 03:41:25.405
RETURNS THERE IS A HUGE REASON

03:41:25.472 --> 03:41:26.740
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE BUILDING

03:41:26.806 --> 03:41:30.644
MORE TRANSMISSION WHY. EVEN MORE

03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:33.246
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. ARE

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:36.016
EASILY AVAILABLE. AVERAGE CAP

03:41:36.082 --> 03:41:39.452
THAT INVESTMENT IN TRANSMISSION

03:41:39.519 --> 03:41:40.720
WHICH WOULD BE THE FACE VALUE

03:41:40.787 --> 03:41:43.123
PROP PROJECT J. TWO BILLION

03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:45.525

03:41:51.464 --> 03:41:53.433
THAT COST TO THE GREAT PAIR. SO

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:54.801
WHAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING IS A

03:41:54.868 --> 03:41:56.836
MORE BALANCED PLANNING PROCESS
