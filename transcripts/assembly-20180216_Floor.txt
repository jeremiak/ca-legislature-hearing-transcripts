ROBERTS WAS ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY FROM THE SICK AND SIXTY SECOND DISTRICT AS A REPUBLICAN. AND A HARD FOUGHT CAMPAIGN DURING WHICH IS CHIEF RIVAL MADE RACIAL SLURS AGAINST HIM USE INCLUDE CALLING HIM THE INWARD. WHILE IN OFFICE ROBERT SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UCLA AND IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION. MAKING EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE WAS ONE OF THE FREDERICK ROBERTS FAVORITE ACHIEVEMENTS ACCORDING TO HIS NEPHEW ELMER ROBERTS. HE PROPOSED SEVERAL CIVIL RIGHTS AND ANTI LYNCHING MEASURES IN THIS HOUSE. IN JUNE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO HE BECAME THE BOOK HEAP HE WELCOMED THE BLACK NATIONALIST LEADER MARCUS GARVEY TO LOS ANGELES AND WROTE IN HIS PARADE CAR.

AUGUSTA'S HAWKINS. FOLLOWING THE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR CALIFORNIA SIMPLY DEFEAT ROBERT SLANDER UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. UNTIL LYNN NO AFRICAN AMERICAN HAD YET BEEN ELECTED TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA IN THE U. S. CONGRESS. ON THE EVENING OF JULY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO A FEW DAYS AFTER ATTENDING THE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE HE WAS TO BE NAME A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR.

HE WASN'T TURN IN EVERGREEN CEMETERY AND HE WAS SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE PEARL AND TWO DAUGHTERS GLORIA AND PATRICIA ROBERTS. TODAY ONE OF MADISON OH HINMAN'S DESCENDANTS IT SAID COULD BE IN THE INDICATIVE OF ROBERTS A LEGACY. THEY SAY WE SIMPLY ACCEPT THE WHO WE ARE WHAT WE ARE. WE LOOK LIKE THE RAINBOW COALITION WHEN WE GET TOGETHER. FREDERICK MADISON ROBERTS FELT THAT WE ARE ALL AMERICANS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT A SUCH AND SHOULD WORK TIRELESSLY TOWARD HIS GOAL. WE WANTED YESTERDAY EVENING. TO HAVE THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY A WITH US IN THE HERE TODAY AS WELL. BUT WE ALSO HONOR TO HEAR THE HISTORY OF THIS MAN. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING AS I POINTED OUT THE OTHER DAVID ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE SOMETIMES COME TO THE FLOOR AND WE TALK ABOUT HISTORY REMIND OURSELVES. OF THIS MONTH CELEBRATION. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IN A MONTH ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS. BUT WE HOPE TO DO A COUPLE THINGS ONE TO SPARK YOUR INTEREST AND MAKE YOU FEEL SO INADEQUATE. THAT YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW OUR HISTORY THAT WE DON'T KNOW OUR COMPLETE HISTORY AND AS A RESULT OF NOT KNOWING IT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING EVERY DAY TO KNOW MORE AND MORE ABOUT OURSELVES. ROBERTS HISTORY REMINDS US OF JUST HOW HARD IT WAS FOR A PERSON TO WORK TO GET ELECTED. EVEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE WERE NO OTHER ROLE MODELS FOR HIM TO LOOK TO. HE HE FELT HE WAS AN AMERICAN HE KNEW HE WAS AN AMERICAN AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE IN THIS HOUSE IN ON THIS FLOOR. AND AS A RESULT HE SERVICE SIXTEEN YEARS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND MOST OF US DIDN'T ALWAYS NAME UNTIL WE CAME IN DISCOVERED IN THIS RECORD BOOK. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS TO COME AND OTHERS TO COME TO THIS HOUSE. SO IT SHOULD REMIND US OF JUST HOW RICH OUR HISTORY IS AND HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW. AS I POINTED OUT LAST NIGHT AFTER HAVING STUDIED AND TAUGHT AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. EVERY DAY I LEARN SOMETHING NEW. THAT MAKES ME FEEL INADEQUATE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION I NEEDED WITH ALL THE DEGREES I HAVE. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO APPRECIATE EVERY CALIFORNIA BUT NOT ONLY THAT NOT ONLY HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO US WOULD JUST THINK ABOUT HE KNEW EARL WARREN. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EARL WARREN TO THE WHOLE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. PROBABLY WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS FRIENDSHIP AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS GENTLEMAN. THAT HE KNEW ON A PERSONAL LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME HUMANITY VIA THAT NEED TO BE SOME FAIRNESS AND SOME SOME EFFORT TO TRY TO CREATE SOME SENSE OF EQUALITY FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND SO WE NEVER KNOW EVERY DAY WHO WE MEET. BUT WE KNOW THAT EACH ONE OF US A MAKING HISTORY IN SOME VERY A POSITIVE WAY. AND WE HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO BLACK ISSUE JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO REMIND ME THAT NO I CAN'T LEARN IT ALL IN A MONTH. BUT I DISCOVERED I HAVE LEARNED IT ALL IN SIXTY NINE YEARS BUT I'M STILL A STUDENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY I'M STILL A STUDENT CALIFORNIA HISTORY I'M STILL A STUDENT OF U. S. HISTORY IN WOMEN'S HISTORY. AND WHEN WE DO NOT GIVE ALL OF US THE SPACE AND THE RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED. IT LESSENS EACH AND EVERYONE OF US SO ON BEHALF OF THE BLACK CAUCUS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALLOWING US TO READ HIS HISTORY. OUR HISTORY THE HISTORY OF THIS ASSEMBLY BUT ISSUES THAT WERE FOUGHT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ON BEHALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND WE SHOULD TAKE PRIDE IN THIS LEGACY. THAT HE LEFT FOR US AND THAT WE KNOW EACH ONE OF US THEY AND ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HE'S MADE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR US TO VOTE I OWN HR SEVENTY FIVE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER ARE ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CAUCUS AYE TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF HR SEVENTY FIVE LET ME FIRST START BY WISHING EVERYONE A HAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR. THE MOST FAVORED OF ANTI HAVE DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY MY DISTRICT IS AN EVENT THAT CELEBRATES BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND LUNAR NEW YEAR. AND IT'S NOT JUST MY FAVORITE EVENT BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE COMING TOGETHER AND WE'RE SHARING CULTURE AND WORK SHARING SOCIAL TIES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US BECAUSE THE STRUGGLES OF OUR ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAVE FOLLOWED. THAT OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. BEFORE THE HISTORY OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND THE JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT. WE FOLLOW THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND JIM CROW LAWS. BEFORE THE HISTORICAL TRIUMPHS OF OUR ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE FOLLOWED THE HARD FOUGHT FIGHT OF DECADES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I WOULD APPEAR TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN MY TWENTIES TO WORK FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGAL ORGANIZATION ROOTED IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN AND I THINK I SPEAK ALSO FOR OUR LATINO COLLEAGUES ARE LGBT COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS. I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE STANDING HERE ON THIS FLOOR BUT FOR THE STRUGGLES AND TRIUMPHS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHEN IT CAME TO VOTING RIGHTS WHEN IT CAME TO LOOK TOWARD REFORMS. WHEN IT CAME TO WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS RITUALLY ABOUT. BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS NOT ONLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT OUR HISTORY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TRUE EQUALITY. WE DON'T HAVE TRUE QUALITY WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE. WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. WHEN IT COMES TO INCOME. WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BLACK HISTORY MONTH REMINDS US. THAT THE IDEA OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR LAWS NOT YET A VALUE THAT EVERYONE IN EVERY COMMUNITY SEASON THIS IS WHY. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY FIVE AND I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY FIVE. DESIGNATING FEBRUARY IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS ABOUT CELEBRATING BOTH THE LEGACY AND THE FUTURE OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE RECOGNIZE IN FRONT. INFLUENTIAL LEADERS TO HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS WELL AS LEADING IN SO MANY FIELDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED. ALL ASPECTS OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD. TODAY WE RECOGNIZE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND YET THERE WERE MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO LACK RECOGNITION DESPITE THEIR TALENT THEIR SKILLS THEIR BRAVERY THEIR PERSEVERANCE. AND ALL OF THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THESE ARE OFTEN AMERICANS WHO MADE SACRIFICES IN SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERS AND THE MEMBERS HERE ON THE FLOOR. TO EDUCATE US AND SHARE WITH US SOME OF THOSE STORIES. THE. BLACK HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE MADE. AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE WITH ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE RALLIED BEHIND BLACK LIVES MATTER. MOVEMENT ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF BLACK LIVES MATTER WE SHOULD GARZA. WAS RAISED IN MARIN COUNTY AND IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE. BLACK LIVES MATTER STARTED AS A SOCIAL MEDIA MOVEMENT TO END VIOLENCE POLICING THE OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE AND RACISM. IN UNITED STATES AND IT'S NOW RECOGNIZED GLOBALLY. ACCORDING TO MS GARZA THE REASON THAT SHE CREATED BLACK LIVES MATTER IN THIS WAY IS BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BUILD A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT. AND SELF DETERMINATION. BLACK HISTORY MONTH ALLOWS US TO REFLECT ON OUR COUNTRY'S PAST AND REMINDS US. THAT THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN PROFFERING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAVANT AS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO AT ALL THE PRETTY CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY FIVE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR PARTY SEVEN DIFFERENT POCKETS AS. FEBRUARY CELEBRATES A REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS WHO ARE MADE COMMENDABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY IN SPITE OF OVERWHELMING OBSTACLES. BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. IN FACT THE EVENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE AS THE BEGINNING OF THE LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AT STONEWALL INN IN ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WAS PREDOMINATELY LED BY BLACK AND LATINO QUEER AND TRANSGENDER YOUTH. DESPITE BEING AT THE HEART OF OUR NATION STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS MANY AVERBAKH LGBTQ ICONS ARE OFTEN INVISIBLE OR ERASED. FROM BOTH LGBT Q. AND AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. ONE EXAMPLE BEING THE FORMATION OF A BLACK LESBIAN CAUCUS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS OFFERED BLACKENED MEDINA LESBIANS AN ALTERNATIVE FROM WHITE MALE DOMINATED POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK. AND THE DISCRIMINATORY ATMOSPHERE OF BOTH URBAN GAY AND LESBIAN BARS. NOW FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE AFRICAN ANCESTRY A LESBIAN UNITED FOR SOCIAL CHANGE PEACE ALSO SO SISTERS GALVANIZED AROUND ISSUES PERTINENT TO LESBIAN WOMEN. NOT JUST DOT THE TRULY DEMONSTRATED WHAT IT MEANS TO PERSIST. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HIGHLIGHT IN HONOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR BLACK LGBTQ ACTIVISTS. WHO HAD FOUGHT FOR SO MANY DECADES THEY HAVE MADE SACRIFICES SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY THE RIGHTS THAT WE DO TODAY? I AM PROUD TO STAND ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS IN AUSTRIA I SUPPORTER ON HR SEVENTY FIVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALLY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I. I RISE TODAY TO PROBABLY SUPPORT HR SEVENTY FIVE RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY AS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. WELL WE SHOULD NOT LIMIT OUR CELEBRATION OF THE HISTORY AND AMERICANS TO A SINGLE MONTH. IS IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP EVERY FEBRUARY TO REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT MANY FOR MANY YEARS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. TO OUR COUNTRY WERE LARGELY LEFT OUT OF OUR TEXTBOOKS AND IGNORED. THIS YEAR I LEARNED A LITTLE ABOUT FREDERICK ROBERTS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO SERVE HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. A SIMILAR ROBERTS WHO I SHOULD NOTE WAS A REPUBLICAN. SERVED IN THIS BODY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. HE SPONSORED LEGISLATION LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH UCLA. HE WORKED AT TO EXPAND THE USE OF SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS IN SCHOOLS ANY SERVE TO AND WAS A CHAMPION FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE CAPITAL. I COURAGE EVERYONE TO USE BLACK HISTORY MONTH TO LEARN A LESSON OF OUR PAST IT CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER. TOWARD EQUALITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THIS NATION. I STRONGLY SUPPORT SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IN HOUSE FOR NIVEAU. THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MOST MEMBER EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU METASPECTRUM MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH AS WE SPEAK A LOT OF THIS CHAMBER ABOUT HISTORICAL FIGURES AS WELL WE SHOULD ABOUT THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED. AND I THINK IT'S A IT SPECIALLY FITTING THAT WE TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MILITARY TO AN AFRICAN AMERICANS HISTORY OF OF SERVICE. AS A AS A VETERAN I CAN TELL YOU BASIC TRAINING WHEN. YOU WEAR A BLACK AND BROWN TOGETHER IN THE MILITARY BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE OF OF OF INTEGRATION AT AN EARLIER STAGE. AND BASIC TRAINING WE ALL CRIED THE SAME TEARS WILL CRICHTON CALLED ON THE SAME GROUND AND WILL SERVE VERY PROUDLY TOGETHER. AND I WAS PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE AFRICAN AMERICANS I WAS PROUD TO HAVE HAD MOST ALL OF MY SUPERVISORS. BOTHA ELECT ADMIN ELECTED A NCOS AS WELL AS OFFICERS BE AFRICAN AMERICAN FIND SOLDIERS WHO WERE PROUD TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY FROM ALL OVER THE. MALL OVER THAT THE. THE STATE'S WHEN WE. I WORK AT WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER KIMBROUGH ARMY HOSPITAL BUT BACK IN THE DC AREA WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAVE RETIRED. AND THE RICHNESS OF SERVING THE VETERANS WHO SERVED BACK THROUGH WORLD WAR TWO I WAS ALWAYS HUMBLING. PEOPLE WOULD COME IN FOR SERVICE NO WE FAST FORWARD IT TO TO MY TIME IN ON THE SECOND CITY COUNCIL A AND THE RICH DIVERSITY IN STOCKTON. THE LONG HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS SERVING IN ELECTED OFFICE. IN MY CITY THE TRACY A STRONG REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN ELECTED OFFICE AT WE ALSO HAVE A VERY RICH FORMING A BACKGROUND EVERY SINGLE TO MILE PARADE WHICH IS OUR LARGEST PARADE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AFRICAN AMERICANS COME OUT ON HORSEBACK. AND HAVE THE RODEO RIDERS ó ALWAYS BRING UP THE THE BACK SO WE ARE COVERED ON ALL SIDES BY A RICH DIVERSITY A AND THEN I FAST FORWARD TO WHICH YOU ARE YOUNG BAR YOUNG MAYOR RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE YOU MIGHT GET TIRED OF ME TALKING ABOUT HIM BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT HIM ENOUGH A AS HE STARTS EVERY SPEECH YOU'LL ASK DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE. FROM HIS OWN LIFE ON SOUTH SIDE STOCKTON BEING RAISED IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. WITH WITH WITHOUT THE RICHES BUT THAT ROSE THAT WAS NURTURED BY A MOTHER AND A GRANDMOTHER AND AUNTIE WHO TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE HE HAD EVERYTHING HE NEEDED. IF THE ENVIRONMENT WAS IN PROVIDING AND THEY WERE PROVIDING IT WITH HIM. YOU CAN TURN ON THE NATIONAL TV AND SEE HIM SPEAKING NOW AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD AFTERTHE CITY OF STOCKTON AND WHAT WE NEED TO REALLY BE ABLE TO EMPOWER. YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE WE NEVER GET AHEAD MEMBERS WHEN ANYONE GETS LEFT BEHIND SO I RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF THE. LATINO CAUCUS ASPIRIN AYE VOTE ON HR SEVEN FIVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I ALSO STAND TO FOR VETERANS. AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE SERVED THIS COUNTRY LOYALLY BRAVELY AND WELL. EVEN ONE THE COUNTRY WASN'T SERVING THEM OF OILY GRATEFULLY AND WELL. THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD TO FIGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT. SO STRANGE DICHOTOMY. AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR. ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE UNION ARMY WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN. WORLD WAR ONE. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICANS PARTICIPATED MAINLY A STEVEDORES AND SUPPLY PEOPLE. AND THEY ALSO RAN A LARGE CHUNK OF THE RARE ROOMS. WITHOUT THAT LABOR WITHOUT THAT BACKING. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN DEEP TROUBLE. AND THEY WERE. DISCRIMINATED AGAINST GREATLY. BUT THEY STILL DID THEIR JOB. STILL DID IT. WORLD WAR TO WAS EVEN MORE PROBLEMATICAL TO SOME EXTENT. ONCE AGAIN TWO THIRDS OF THE SUPPLY LINES WERE RUN BY AFRICAN AMERICANS ESPECIALLY THE RED BALL EXPRESS WHICH PUT HIGH PRIORITY PARTS AND. BACK UP TO KEY UNITS THE NINETY SECOND DIVISION. BUFFALO SOLDIERS FOUGHT. AND FOUGHT. HAD UP PER CAPITA HIGHER CASUALTY RATE MUCH LIKE THE JAPANESE FOR FOR TO COMBAT REGIMENT. THEY FOUGHT. AND WHEN THEY WENT BACK HOME. LEADING GET MUCH OF A PARADE. THE BIG BREAKTHROUGH CAME. BY PRESIDENT. TRUMAN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. WHEN WE FULLY DESEGREGATED THE MILITARY AND OF COURSE THE ADMIRALS AND GENERALS PREDICTED THE MILITARY WOULD COLLAPSE. WELL THAT BRINGS THIS TO VIETNAM. IN VIETNAM. I WILL GUARANTEE YOU BULLETS AND SHRAPNEL DID NOT CHECK THE MELANIN LEVEL OF THE VICTIM. EVERYONE GOT HIT EQUALLY. AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAD A HIGHER PER CAPITA CASUALTY RATE. THAN ANYONE ELSE. TWO THEORIES THEIR NUMBER ONE. THEY WERE ALWAYS PUT AT THE FRONT. WHICH I BELIEVE I'VE OBSERVE THAT NUMBER TO. THEY ENDED UP IN MOST OF THE COMBAT UNITS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WORK JUST REGULATED TO DEMEAN SUPPLIES. AND WHEN THEY GOT A CHANCE TO FIGHT. THEY FOUGHT. THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY. TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS AFRICAN AMERICAN SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT IS IN THE MILITARY IN A REASON FOR THAT IS. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. YOU ARE TREATED EQUALLY IN THE MILITARY AFRICAN AMERICANS KNOW. THAT IS A TICKET LIKE FOR ME OUT OF POVERTY. AND TO EDUCATION. SO I GREATLY SUPPORT HR SEVENTY FIVE. GOD BLESS YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION MISTER HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. A FEW MINUTES SPEAKER. LET ME JUST ALSO THINK ALL OF OUR MY COLLEAGUES TO. ROSE TO SPEAK TODAY AND ASSURE THEIR THEIR SENTIMENTS IN THEIR THOUGHTS. ON THIS IMPORTANT DAY. I KNOW CLEARLY THAT. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT ALL OF YOU HAD TO SAY TOUCHES ON ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO. ARE FOLLOW YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR YOUR COMMENTS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DAY THAT IS ONE THAT WE. ALL RECOGNIZE EVERY YEAR. BUT TODAY WHEN WE ASK FOR CO AUTHORS. ON THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION. I WANT YOU TO. TO REALLY FOCUS ON. FREDERICK ROBERTS. BECAUSE WHEN HE CAME HERE HE WAS THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN HERE. AND HE BELIEVED AS YOU HEARD THAT. SERVING IN THIS BODY AND PUBLIC SERVICE WAS AN HONOR. AND IT WAS ONE THAT HE WAS GOING TO. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF. THAT HE WAS GOING TO ARTICULATE THE CONCERNS ON THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PEOPLE IN HIS COMMUNITY EXPERIENCED. AND LOOK TO HIM TO BE THEIR TALENT. THEIR THEIR LEADER ON. SO AS I LOOK AT ALL OF YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. YOU REPRESENT UNIQUE THE DISTINCT PARTS OF THIS DAY. YOU COME HERE TO REPRESENT. WHAT HAS THE VERY BEST IN YOUR COMMUNITY? YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR VALUES. AND WITHIN THIS BUILDING WE TRY TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO A COMMON PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. SO WILL YOU PUSH THE GREEN BUTTON AND JOIN ON AS A A CO AUTHOR. KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING SOMEONE WHO CAME BEFORE US TO. HAD TO SHOW COURAGE. AT A SHOW DEDICATION. HOW TO REPRESENT SILENT VOICES THAT NEEDED TO BE HEARD? AND THAT DOES WHILE YOU'RE HERE AS WELL. SO COLLECTIVELY WE CAN ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. THAT FREDERICK ROBERTS BELIEVED AND THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN DESCENT. HE WAS IN AMERICA.
