MATHIS PATTERSON RAMOS YOUR RUBIO HERE WOULD HERE. WITHOUT A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT OUR STATE IS FACING UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES AND AS WE COPE WITH THE COPAY NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ALL OF THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND FISCAL EFFECTS OF THE AND EMPLOYMENT CRISIS THAT IT HAS CREATED. AS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO SERVE THIS STATE AND BE A PART IN THE EFFORTS WE'VE TAKEN SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION TO RESTORE AND IMPROVE OUR SAFETY NET. TO EXTEND HEALTH CARE AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN OUR GREAT STATE. NOW WE ABRUPTLY FIND OURSELVES IN THIS NEW MOMENT OF TREMENDOUS NEEDS FOR OUR NEWLY DISPLACED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE SEE SHARP INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS FOR OUR PUBLIC INCOME SUPPORT AND BENEFITS PROGRAMS. LINES OF HUNGRY FAMILIES ARE WAITING OUTSIDE OF FOOD BANKS. EVEN WITH THE FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS AND EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH AREN'T UNIVERSAL BENEFITS. FULL AREN'T ABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT AND THERE IS SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT AN ADDICTION CRISIS THAT COULD COME UPON US ONCE THE SO WHAT IS OUR ROLE HERE IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARENA. I THINK IT IS TO DEFINE AND TO FRAME HOW THE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FIT INTO THIS COBIT PICTURE AND THE BUDGET GRAPPLING WITH ECONOMIC RECESSION. IT IS MY MOTTO TODAY AND WILL BE FOR AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THIS FIGHT THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARE INTEGRAL TO THE COUNTER RECESSION EFFORT. AND TO UNDERMINE THEM DURING THIS TIME THREATENS TO ELONGATE AND DEEPEN OUR ECONOMIC TROUBLES. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM STATE LEADERS ACROSS CRITICAL PROGRAMS STAKEHOLDERS WHO REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF OUR SAFETY NET FABRIC ANDYOU THE PUBLIC WHOM WE ALL SERVE. FOR THE HEALTH PANEL WERE FOCUSING ON THE DIRE NEED TO REBUILD OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE RECOGNIZING THAT HEALTHCARE IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR ECONOMY. AND THAT OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY DEPENDS ON. FOR THE HUMAN SERVICES PANEL WERE ASKING HOW ARE PUBLIC PROGRAMS ARE RESPONDING. HOW THEY ARE WORKING AND WHAT TROUBLE AREAS AND CHALLENGES WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF AS TIME GOES ON. MY GOAL IS TO PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH AVID ADVOCATES TO BUILD THE FLEXIBILITY AND PROGRAM CHANGES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS AUTHORIZED INTO OUR BUDGET PLAN. EXTENDING THOSE POLICIES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO DO SO STRENGTHENING OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO FAMILIES IN NEED. ALLEVIATE SUFFERING AND TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. I ALSO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION APPROACHES THAT WE REGRET AND NEED TO AVOID. THE CHANGES MADE AND THAT TIME OR DRAMATIC AND WE STILL HEAR ABOUT THE REMAINING DAMAGE THAT IS STILL ON ADDRESSED. I WANT TO ALSO BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ISSUES WE HAVE SELECTED TO DISCUSS TODAY ARE JUST TWO OF MANY URGENT CRITICAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF THIS CRISIS. SADLY WE DO NOT HAVE THE HEARING TIME AND SPACE TO ADDRESS ALL OR EVEN A FEW OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING OUR STATE. NEVER THE LESS THE LAB LEGISLATURE IS EVERY BIT AS CONCERNED ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING THE NURSING HOME CRISIS THE URGENT NEED TO BUILD OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE. AND MANY OTHER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUES. AND IS WORKING ON THESE CHALLENGES OUTSIDE OF OUR VERY LIMITED HEARING PROCESS. FINALLY I WANT TO EMBRACE ALL OF THE IMPORTANT LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST DECADE. ABOUT THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF POVERTY ON CHILDREN AND THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND HOW THEY SHAPE A LIFE TRAJECTORY INCOME INEQUALITY AND THE INABILITY FOR FAMILIES TO WORK FULL TIME AND STILL PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. GIVEN OUR COST OF LIVING. ABOUT OUR HEALTH DISPARITIES WHICH ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES AND ABOUT THE RAVAGES OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOW THAT INCREASING ACROSS OUR STATE. ABOUT HOW ALL OF US ARE LINKED TOGETHER AND NEED TO ASSURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER DURING THIS CURRENT STORM. NO MATTER WHAT. NOW I'D LIKE TO OPEN THIS UP FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS BEFORE WE START OUR FIRST PANEL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WILL BE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM I THINK- YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY COME BACK AND START WORKING ON SOME OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THIS COURSE THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS BUT I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE HERE TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT A GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE AHEAD SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE- FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO. SOME WORK I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH BUT I THINK THAT IF WE ARE TRULY TOGETHER WE CAN ACCOMPLISH MANY THINGS AND HOPEFULLY GET OURSELVES AND THE STATE AND AGAIN THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION I DON'T WANT TO I KNOW IS TO COME SO THANK YOU AND AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU MY COLLEAGUES AND HAPPY TO SEETHE STAFF AT BUT I KNOW THAT- THESE ARE TRYING TIMES AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- ECHO YOUR- REMARKS FOR THE SPEAKER LEGISLATURE AND EVERYONE THAT'S CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS WE DISCUSS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO- LOOK AT AND GET RESOURCES FOR THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE SUFFERING- WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION- WE SEEN UP TO- DURING THIS TIME IN COVERT NINETEEN OF THOSE SEEKING THOSE SERVICES ON THROUGH THE COUNTIES AND THROUGH THE STATE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IS PART OF THE DIALOGUE AND ALSO AS WE TALK ABOUT- THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CERTAINLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDING A VOICE TO THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN- POPULATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SUFFERS- HIGH RATES OF DIFFERENT ILLNESSES- THAT ARE UNDERLYING ISSUES- FOR THE MAJOR POPULATIONS AND WORKING TO ENSURE IN HEARING IDEAS OF HOW- COUNTIES THE STATE ARE REACHING OUT TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND VICE VERSA MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. WE KNOW THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- EDUCATION ALL THOSE AREAS THAT HERE IN AND HEALTH AND SUB ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS THE PRESENTERS COME FORWARD THAT THAT STAYS IN THEIR MIND AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS- CERTAINLY THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND WITH THAT I WILL BEGIN OUR FIRST PANEL. THERE ARE A CLUSTER OF QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA THAT DESCRIBE THE FOCUS OF EACH PANEL. PRIOR TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN CRISIS CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE STRATEGIES WERE SEVERE AND WIDELY RECOGNIZED. YET NOW WE FACE THE IRONY THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT OUR HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE TO ITS KNEES. WE ALL COLLECTIVELY HAVE DONE SUCH AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF SHELTERING IN PLACE. AVOIDING ANY AND ALL NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE AND OF EMPTYING OUR HOSPITALS SO THAT WE COULD RESPOND TO A SURGE IN COVERT NINETEEN CASES SIMILAR TO NEW YORK CITY. THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY DISMANTLED OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE MUST FIND WAYS TO BRING IT BACK TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH OF COURSE. BUT ALSO TO RESTORE OUR ECONOMY. I NOW WANT TO ASK AN OPERATOR TO OPEN THE LINE SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM PANEL ONE WITH BEN JOHNSON OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ASKED THE LA- TO SUMMARIZE THE REPORTS WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE MAJOR HEALTH CARE SECTORS. LEAVING OUR HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS SINCE THOSE SECTORS ARE RIPPED REPRESENTED ON OUR PANEL. ON THE IMPACTS OF THE KOBE CRISIS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE WORKFORCES. THEN. HI BEN JOHNSON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PLEASE LET ME KNOW IT BY COME THROUGH ON CLEAR AT AT ANY TIME DURING THIS CALL- GOOD MORNING TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO TESTIFY HERE- AS DR CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA NOTED WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO- PRESENT ON HOW THE CODE NINETY CRISIS IS AFFECTING THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND ITS WORK FORCE- THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECEIVED THESE RECORDS AND WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO SUMMARIZE PERSPECTIVES BEFORE DIVING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF OUR MARCH HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EVER EVOLVING SITUATION- WHERE THE IMPACT ON PROVIDERS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. MOREOVER WE FOUND HARD DATA ON THE FISCAL AND PROGRAMMATIC IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN HARD TO COME BY AND SO IN THE TIME THAT WE HAD TO PREPARE FOR THAT HEARING OUR OFFICE WITH NOT ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE REPORTING OF PROVIDERS AND AS SUCH WE GET THE EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE NOT MAKING LA- FINDINGS BUT RATHER REPORTING THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE. VARIOUS PROVIDER GROUPS. NOW TURN. SUMMARIZE IT ALLOW HIGH LEVEL THE XP OF PROVIDERS UNDER COBRA NINETEEN HOW THE EMERGENCY IS AFFECTING THEIR FINANCIAL BOTTOM LINE. AND HOW SUCH FINANCIAL IMPACT ULTIMATELY AFFECTING THE WORK FORCE. FIRST WE OBSERVE WE'RE HEARING THAT PROVIDERS ARE HAVING INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT OF IN NINETEEN- BOTHAS A RESULT OF HIGHER COSTS FOR PERSONAL. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- FROM PRICE INCREASES AND THE NEED FOR GREATER SUPPLIES AND THEY'RE ALSO REPORTING HIGHER STAFFING COSTS YOU DO NEED TO PAY OVERTIME HIRING OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS STAFF AND IN SOME CASES IN HIGH RISK AREAS. PAYING HAZARD PAY NURSING HOMES ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF- PROVIDED TIGHT THAT IS FACING SUCH HIGHER COSTS. AND THEN FINALLY PROVIDERS ARE MAKING NEW INVESTMENTS TO HELP THEM ADAPT TO THE CHANGING SERVICES ENVIRONMENT SUCH OF MODIFYING FACILITIES TO ALLOW FOR GREATER ISOLATION OF POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS PATIENTS. AND EXPANDING THEIR TELEHEALTH AND VIRTUAL HEALTH CAPABILITIES. ON THE PATIENT VOLUME AND REVENUE SIDE PROVIDERS ARE REPORTING A FAIRLY DIRE SITUATION YOU'LL HEAR FROM PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS LATER ON THIS PANEL WHO CAN SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE HEARD FROM HEALTH CENTERS WHO ARE REPORTING- THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT LAUGHLIN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF PATIENT VISITS BEING DOWN BY 4250% COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS DEDICATED THAT EVEN NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL HEY THERE THE REDUCED VOLUME OF SERVICES. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF DENTISTRY SURVEY DATA COLLECTED BY DENTISTS GROUP CHAU DENTAL SERVICES VOLUMES BEING DOWN BY UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT. WITH THE ONLY EMERGENCY DENTAL SERVICES CONTINUING RALLY TO OCCUR. IN SOME STATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS MAY BE LOOKING AT REVENUE LOSSES IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND GROWING AS THE EMERGENCY CONTINUES. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE TAKEN A AND TAKING A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO RESPOND TO THIS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN UTILIZATION AND REVENUE SUCH AS BY TEMPORARY CLOSING OR LIMITING THEIR HOURS OF OPERATION. AND THAT WHILE SUCH THAT CAN AT LEAST ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. BRING PROVIDER COSTS AND REVENUES AND THE CLOSER ALIGNMENT THE FACT THAT MANY PROVIDERS HAVE FIXED COSTS IN THE FORM OF LOANS AND LEASES FOR THE OFFICE SPACE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT MEANS THAT SUCH MEASURES MAY ARE ONLY TEMPORARILY HE IS THE THAT REALLY CHIEF FINANCIAL STRAIN. OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SPECIFICALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS BOTH ON THE CLINICAL AND THE NON CLINICAL SIDE OF THE WORK FORCE. AND BUT FOR THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE CONTINUING TO OPERATE WE UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT WORK WORKERS ARE SOMETIMES RECEIVING THOSE OVERTIME PAYMENTS THE HOUSE ARE PAY AND WE'VE ALSO ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHILD CARE SO THAT WORKERS CAN CONTINUE TO WORK- DESPITE THE. SCHOOLS BEING CLOSE. MEASURES HAVE BEEN. BY PUBLIC IN PRIVATE AND TO BEGIN TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE THERE BEEN NEW FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES- CONGRESS HAS PASSED A SERIES OF LEGISLATION IN RESPONSE TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN- AMERICAN CITY AND THESE PIECES OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND INCLUDED APPROPRIATIONS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THE LARGEST SOURCE OF DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDING HERE FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GIVES A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATED THROUGH THE CARE EXACT AN INITIAL ROUND OF THIS FUNDING HAVE GONE OUT WITH HELD CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS RECEIVING NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN RELIEF. THIS FUNDING WE BELIEVE WILL HELP PROVIDED CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS THEIR BOTTOM LINE- PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LARGE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENT POPULATIONS. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER IN THE STATE OF RECEIVED A ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION FROM A SEPARATE POT OF FUNDING- DOES THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THEIR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. AND BOTH OF THESE PARTS OF FUNDING THE FUNDING FOR THAT BEING ALLOCATED THROUGH MEDICARE FOR A VARIETY OF PROVIDED TYPES IN THE FUNDING FOR HEALTH CENTERS REALLY SHOULD HELP PREVENT PERMANENT CLOSURES AND THE LAYING OFF OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS. FINALLY WE NOTE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND WORKERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OFTHE MORE GENERAL FORMS OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY APPROVED BY CONGRESS CONGRESS. SUCH AS THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM LOANS TO HELP THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER IN OPERATION AND OTHER PLAYERS AND THE WORKERS EMPLOYED AS WELL AS THE ENHANCE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR WORKERS WHO ARE WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR FOR A LOVED. IN ADDITION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED SOMETIMES AT THE REQUEST OF THE STATE'S MEDI CAL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE NEW PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY FLEXIBILITY SUCH AS PAYMENT PARTY. FOR CERTAIN SERVICES BETTER BUILT DELIVERED VIRTUALLY OR TOUGH TELEPHONICALLY. AND THIS ALLOWS PROVIDED CONTINUE TO DELIVER SERVICES THAT OTHERWISE- WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN FOR GONE ENSURING SUMMARY REVENUE CONTINUES TO COME IN. AND LIKELY PROTECT THE EARNINGS OF THOSE PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE TO SERVICES ARE MORE AMENABLE TO VIRTUAL AND TELEPHONIC DELIVERY. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD THAT SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS HAVE BEEN ADAPTING TO INSTEAD PROVIDING THEIR SERVICES VIRTUALLY WITHIN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT WHILE THE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED. WE HAVE HEARD A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT HEALTH PLANS AS WELL ARE TAKING TO ENSURE THE STABILITY OF THEIR PROVIDER NETWORKS FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD HAVE HEALTH PLANS MAKING LOANS TO HELP PROVIDERS WOULD HAVE WITH CASH FLOW. ONE PUBLIC PLAN- CONVERTED IT PAYMENT TO SOME OF ITS PROVIDERS FROM BEING ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS TO- MONTHLY CAPITATED BASIS SO THAT THE PAYMENT CONTINUE TO FLOW REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT- SERVICE UTILIZATION MEMBERS. AND THEN OTHER PLANS ARE MAKING XCELERATED ARE ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO THE PROVIDER AND PROVIDERS. WE WOULD EXPECT LEAD TO PURCHASE TO BEAR SOME FRUIT IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THAT PROVIDERS FROM BY THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND HELP TO PREVENT BREAKDOWN BEEN HEALTH PLAN PROVIDER NETWORKS AND ALSO STABILIZE THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. DON'T INCLUDE PROVIDERS REPORTING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL STRAIN CALLED BIKE OF IN NINETEEN BOTH IN TERMS OF HIGHER COSTS AND HIGHER REVENUES AND THESE ARE IMPACTING HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE- BEING AFFECTED BY CARLOS AND LAYOFFS. THERE HAVE BEEN MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY BOTH. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES SUBJECT CONGRESS AND SUCH AS BY HEALTH PLANS TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL STRAIN. AND WE JUST KNOW THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES CHOOSE TO PROVIDE ANY LET'S LIMITED RESOURCES TO HELP HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE UNDER THIS CRISIS. IN MAY WISH TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE THESE EXISTING SOURCES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SUPPORT. WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU BÃ N AND NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SHELLEY. ONE DOCTOR RANDY RUN NUMBERS- AND SHELLY REQUIRED AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- NETWORK ADEQUATELY AND THE MEDICAL WATCHED RATIO- WOULD YOU PROCESS. SO YOU WOULD PRESENTED ME SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO ANSWER AND- HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE TIME THAT YOU ASKED FOR A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT DATA ON NETWORK ADEQUACY ENORMOUS CARE PLAN. SO OUR MOST RECENT REVIEW OF HEALTH PLAN NETWORK DATA WHICH FOR MEASUREMENT YOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE PLAN. COMPLIANCE WITH THE KNOX KEEN ACT. THE DEPARTMENT WE THE THAT WERE DATA MEASURE MY YOUR TO NINETEEN ON MY ARE A LAST FRIDAY. AND OUR EVIEW WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT WHAT IMPACT DO WE EXPECT THE KOBE QUAKE TO HAVE A NETWORK ADEQUATELY AND WHETHER MANAGED CARE AND WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN NETWORK ADEQUACY. IT'S REALLY TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SHORT OR LONG TERM IMPACT BECAUSE THE NINETEEN CRISIS WILL HAVE ON HEALTH PLAN THAT WORKS- AND THE LA- POINTED OUT WE HAVE HEARD TO FROM PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY. HEALTH CENTERS IN PARTICULAR. REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS WITH REDUCED INCOME STAFF LAYOFFS AND REDUCTION IN WORK HOURS. MANY OF THESE PROVIDERS TO TRANSITION TO PROVIDING SERVICES VIA TELEHEALTH WHILE OTHERS ARE JUST BEGINNING AT TRANSITION. IN ADDITION TO OUR ANNUAL MONITORING OF HEALTH PLAN NETWORK WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE ACTIVITIES AROUND PROVIDER NETWORKS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF NEW FILINGS THAT WE RECEIVE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH HEALTH PLANS REPORT A 10% CHANGE IN PROVIDER NAME. TERMINATION OF HEALTH PLAN CONTRACTED HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE ORGANIZATION. AS WELL AS CALL THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED TO THE HELP THAT ARE. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PROVIDER WORKFORCE THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THE SITUATION. YOUR NEXT QUESTION WAS AROUND- MEDICAL LOCKED RATE RATIO STATUTE AND WHAT REQUIRED THAT TIME LINE AND HOW IT'S OPERATIONALIZED. SO FEDERAL LAW AND AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE YOU ARE- BILL- IF YOU CHAIR LAID OUT THE RULES FOR DETERMINING A HEALTH PLAN AND A LARGELY CALLING THE MLR DIFFERS FOR INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS CLICK HERE TO THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. OTHER REMINDER THE ON A LARK FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKET IS 80% AND FOR A LARGE GROUP THAT 85% BUT WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET MARKET FOR EXAMPLE A PLAN MUST SPEND 80% OF ITS COLLECTED PREMIUMS ON MEDICAL CAUGHT THAT HOSPITAL DOCTORS. PRESCRIPTION DRUG QUALITY INITIATIVES AND OTHER SERVICES FOR ITS MEMBERS. ON THOSE MEDICAL COSTS INCLUDE CLEAN CAPITATION PAYMENT AND ENCOURAGED BUT NOT REPORTED CAUGHT. BUT ON THE MARKET SEGMENT A CLINICAL LAB TO SPEND ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS THAT YOU CAN PLAY TOLERATE THE BENEFIT. OFFICE IN MARKETING AND BEEN ACTIVE OTHER FEES AND POP BUT- I HEALTH PLAN AND A LARGE CALCULATED USING DATA OVER A THREE YEAR CLEAR YET WHICH INCLUDES THE CURRENT YEAR ON THE TWO PRIOR YEARS. THE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN THE DATA WOULD INCLUDE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN GOING. CALCULATING MLR DISPLAYED MOVES OUT THE OUT WIRES FROM YOUR YOUR HIRE SOME THERE'S A LOWER IN A VERY BY PLAN. AND ALLOW REPORT FOR TWENTY NINETEEN IN DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT ON JULY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY THE REPORT IN THE JULY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ANY PLANET FAILED TO MEET THE EIGHTY OR 85% THRESHOLD MCLEAN REBATES AND FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL IF YOU PURCHASED COVERAGE. REBATE YOU'RE PAID EACH YEAR IN SEPTEMBER. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE A HEALTH PLANS MLR IN REAL TIME DUE TO THE LACK IT CLAIMS THE MISSION ALSO BECAUSE THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED- CAN VARY WIDELY FROM MONTH TO MONTH. THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES AND THOROUGHLY REVIEWS THE MLR REPORT. WE ALSO CONDUCT MLR EXAMS AND OUR AUDITS TO ENSURE THE PLANT PROPERLY CATEGORIZED REPORTED THERE. THE IMPACT OF THE NINETEEN WILL SHOW UP IN THE ANNUAL FEDERAL FEDERAL MLR REPORT REPORTING HERE THAT AND THIS YEAR DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND THAT REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED AT THE END OF JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YOU ASKED IF MANAGED CARE PLANS OF EVER BEEN OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE MLR AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES. EACH YEAR THERE ARE SOME PLANS THAT MUST BE BATES INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. BUT THE MOST RECENT YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TWENTY HEALTH PLAN AT NOT INCOMPLETE CROSS BLUE SHIELD A TOTAL OF SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS MON PLAYERS. ONE CLAN COMMUNITY CARE PLAN PAID NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MY GYM PLAYERS AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT CREATED VERY BOB HAS ONLY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS. NO PLAN IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLAYED REBATE TWENTY FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALL% MET. THE 80% AND A LARGE FRACTIONAL. I'LL JUST NOTE THAT TAKES TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN THEY'RE PROGRAM TO WHEN IT'S WITH THAT HELP PLANS THAT. OVER HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DOLLARS MAKE THE DATE. YOU ALSO ASKED IF IT'S REASONABLE THAT WE WON'T HAVE AN ALARM REVIEW INFORMATION A COMPLEX YEAR. AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S REASONABLE IN THE SENSE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL RECEIVE AN ALL OUR RECORDS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN IN JULY. THAT THE TIME PRINT THAT OUT AND FEDERAL LAW. KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT LIKE TINY CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY PROVIDERS. AND EVEN THEN SOMETIMES HEALTH PLAN ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM. HOWEVER RATE FILINGS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL BE OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT ASSUMPTIONS AND UTILIZATION DATA PLANS ARE CONSIDERING LATE EIGHTY PUBLIC NINETEEN. AS WELL AS THE ASSUMPTION AND UTILIZATION DATA FOR THAT. THE MAN BUT MAY EMERGE FOR SERVICE THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED DURING. YOU ALSO ACT THERE SOME WAY TO EXPEDITE THIS REVIEW GIVEN THE EMERGENCY WORK YEAH. IN ADDITION TO THE RIGHT KILEY THAT I JUST MENTIONED HEALTH PLANS FILE QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT THE DEPARTMENT. THESE FILING BASICALLY DETAIL INFORMATION ON EACH HEALTH PLAN ASSETS LIABILITIES RESERVES REVENUES MEDICAL EXPENSE THE MINISTRY TO CLASS. PUBLIC LOSSESAND. AND OTHER DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL FOR TWENTY NINETEEN A GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT ON MAKE THE- TWENTY TWENTY IT'S UNLIKELY WILL BE MUCH IMPACT FROM THE NINETEEN IN BOTH STATEMENT. QUARTER FILING COULD DO AUGUST FIFTEENTH WILL SHOW MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THE HEALTH PLANS FINANCIAL TURN THE CLOCK IT WITH NINETEEN. A WELL AS THE IMPACT OF NOT PROVIDING MANY OTHER TEXAS. HELLO THERE MY COMPARATOR I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DIRECTOR REALLY AREN'T NEXT WE HAVE DIRECTOR GILBERT. GOOD MORNING- DR BELOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SO I WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED AND THEN OF COURSE BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS SO THE FIRST ONE WAS TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT DATA NETWORK ADEQUACY IN MANAGED CARE PLANS SIMILAR TO- WHAT DIRECTOR REAL. WORLD WAS TALKING ABOUT. WE DO NOT WORK CERTIFICATION EVERY YEAR TO ON JULY FIRST TO SEE A MATH UNTIL THE PROCESS GOES THROUGH. THE PERIOD BEFORE THAT WAS THE MISSION BY THE PLAN. LAST YEAR TWENTY OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WERE PUT ON CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THOSE OF ALL BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE THERE'S A SIX MONTH PERIOD FOR THOSE CAPS. THEY CAN HAVE A TIME AND DISTANCE DEFICIENCY DUE TO EITHER NOT SUBMITTING PROPER ANALYSIS. NOT SUBMITTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS SUBMISSION. FOR YOU KNOW THE DHS ACTUALLY DENIES THEIR ALTERNATIVE ACCESS. THAT DURING THE SIX MONTHS AS I MENTIONED AND DURING THAT TIME THE DEPARTMENT MONITORS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. AND REQUIRES A MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE- TIMELY ACCESS TO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS- WHEN THAT IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS. WE ALSO REQUIRE THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO TRAIN THEIR MEMBER SERVICES STAFF AROUND THOSE DETAILS. AND WE DO- ACTUAL SECRET SHOPPER CALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS ARE PROVIDING THE CORRECT INFORMATION. TO THEIR MEMBERS AROUND THOSE RIGHT. DURING THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO THE NETWORK CERTIFICATION- WE DO A TIMELY ACCESS STUDY THAT IS DONE BY OUR- CROW OR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION. WHICH IS HEALTH SERVICES ADVISORY GROUP AND THEY DO PHONE CALLS TO DETERMINE- WHEN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE. THE LATEST RESULTS- FOR TWENTY NINETEEN ON THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WERE ADULTS- FOR NON URGENT NINETY PERCENT. FOR CHILDREN 94% FOR URGENT FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS 81% FOR ADULTS 84% FOR CHILDREN. FOR SPECIALIST THE RESULTS WERE ADULTS 76% CHILD SEVENTY EIGHT FOR NON URGENT AND FOR URGENT ADULTS FOUR POINT 4% WE ALSO DO QUARTERLY MONITORING AND WE FOLLOW UP WITH- THE QUARTERLY MONITORING AROUND PROVIDED A MEMBER RATIOS- NETWORK REPORTS- GRIEVANCES AN APPEALS STATE FAIR HEARING SIX CETERA. AND EVERY QUARTER WE GIVE THE PLANT A QUARTERLY MONITORING RESPONDED TEMPLATE WHICH LOOKED AT OUR GOALS ARE EMPTY PIECE SPECIFIC FINDINGS AND ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. SO THAT'S A OVERVIEW OF OUR NETWORK- ADEQUACY RESULTS AND PROCESS FOR BY LAST YEAR. SECOND QUESTION WAS- SIMILAR THE TO THE ONE PROJECT REGARD WHAT IMPACT EXPECT OF A NETWORK ADEQUACY IN WATER. WHAT YOU KNOW WILL MEANT THAT ACCOUNT MANAGED CARE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO HELP. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR DURING THIS PERIOD IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TYPE AND VOLUME OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY TELEHEALTH. NOT HAS BEEN MENTIONED. YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN REALLY- SOMETHING THE FLEXIBILITY THAT CMS HAS PROVIDED AS IT HAS HELPED QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS CARE AND BE PAID AT THE SAME RATE AS AN IN PERSON VISIT. HOWEVER AS OF THOSE MENTIONED- WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN UTILIZATION IN THE CLINIC WAS SPECIAL FROM ONE HOSPITAL. AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TEMPORARY CLOSURE AND CONSOLIDATION OF CLINIC AND PROVIDER OFFICES- THAT WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED ABOUT. WE GET WE WERE- ACTUALLY DO THAT MONITORING- IN TERMS OF THE PLANS REPORTING ON A DAILY AND WEEKLY BASIS WE THEN MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS HAVE PROPERTIES IN PLACE- WHEN THOSE WE GET THOSE REPORTS OF THE FACILITY KIND CLOSING. THAT THE MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE- EITHER ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS NURSE ADVICE LINE AND IN PERSON URGENT CARE LOCATIONS. THAN IN ANY PLAN THAT ADDITIONAL REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE BUT- INDIVIDUALS OF THE TRANSPORTATIONTHEY NEED. SO WE DO THAT MONITORING- WE LOOK AT IT VERY CLOSELY- WE ARE YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT AND WONDERING ABOUT THE INCREASE IN ACTIVITY THAT WILL OCCUR. AFTER YOU KNOW THINGS START TO OEN UP IN TERMS OF PROVIDERS BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR. DEFERRED AND PREVENTIVE CARE SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'D BE LOOKING OUT TO MAKE SURE ADDS THAT ADDITIONAL CARE START BEING PROVIDED THAT. THE NETWORK IS ADEQUATE TO HANDLE THAT CONTINUE TO RIP A NETWORK AVAIL AND WORKING. CAN THAT MY- I DO WANT TO ASK TO WHAT- BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY HAVE PROVIDED. QUITE A BIT OF SUPPORT WE HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING AND SURVEYING THEIR ACTIVITIES. THERE'S ADVANCE PAYMENT CLERK CELERY IN THEIR PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THERE CAPITA ATTAINING PROVIDERS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY READ- PEEPER SERVICES THAT MENTION. THEIR ADVANCING OUR EXPEDITING PAYMENTS. UNDER INCREASING CAPITATION FOR NETWORK HOSPITAL- THEY'RE DOING QUITE A BIT OF ACTIVITIES AND OF COURSE PAYING FOR TELEHEALTH AS IT'S ON THE SAME BASIS- BALLOT IN PERSON VISIT INCLUDING. IN SOME CASES PAYING OF TELEHEALTH DOESN'T OUTSIDE THE CAPITATION NORMALLY PAID. TO THE PROVIDER THEY'VE DONE GRANT UNTIL THERE'S BEEN JUST QUITE A BIT OF ACTIVITY BY THE- MANAGED CARE PLANS TO SUPPORT THEIR PROVIDERS. AND THEN FINALLY- WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING WITH HERE APS ON THE CHARACTER- FUNDING THAT THAT BEEN MENTIONED IN. IN HIS TALK AS WELL. THIRD QUESTION WOULD HAPPEN IN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE DON'T COMPLY WITH SIMILAR STATE FUNDS. BACK TO THE STATE AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF PIECES ABOUT THAT. DINNER RATE SETTING PROCESS AND THIS IS AS YOU KNOW- LOOKING AT INFORMATION RETROSPECTIVELY- WE DO EVALUATE UTILIZATION PATTERNS AND COST EXPERIENCE. GET UP WE SEE INCREASED OR DECREASED UTILIZATION CAUGHT IN A PERIOD. AND WERE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT HOW THAT WILL LOOK GOING FORWARD THAT WILL IMPACT THE RATES PAID TO THE PLANS. REALIZING THAT THOUGH THE PROSPECT OF RATES AND THE DATA WERE LOOKING OUT HIS RETROSPECTIVE LIKE. AS DEFINED BY FEDERAL MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS- DHS IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP OUR RATES OF PLANS CAN REASONABLY CHEAP AT LEAST ARE TALKED ABOUT AND HER TALK. HIM INTO FIND IN STATE LAW. ON OR AFTER JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WOULD BE THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR REDDING COURAGE OF A PLAN SPEND BELOW THAT 85% PREMIUM. DHS WILL RECOUP THE DIFFERENCE REALIZING THAT SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS GO BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SOME RETAINED BY THE STATE DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR EXPENDITURES IN QUESTION AND THE VARIOUS RATIOS THAT OCCUR. LIKE THE IMAGE HE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS- WE RECEIVE UNAUDITED CALLER QUARTERLY FINANCIAL REPORTS THERE PROVIDED FORTY FIVE DAYS FROM THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. AND WE USE THOSE TO MONITOR- PLAN MLR. KEY AND HE ADMINISTRATIVE CST RATIOS AND WORKING CAPITAL- AS DIRECTORY ARE MENTIONED WILL BE GETTING- THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WHICH MAY NOT SHOW THE FULL IMPACT. OF THE COPA NINETEEN- CHANGES- BUT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THAT IN THE NEXT QUARTERLY REPORT THAT WE WOULD GET THEREAFTER. JUST AS A COMMENT- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT- DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN REPORTS- TWENTY TWO OF TWENTY TWO PLANS RETREATING EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. SOME WERE THREE WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED PERCENT. ELEVEN WERE FROM NINETY FIVE TO NINETY EIGHT AND A PAPER FROM EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY FOUR SO CERTAINLY THE PAST HISTORY. DESCRIBES THE- OUR PLANS ARE IN MOST CASES WELL ABOVE THE 85% RATIO. THIS IS THE THOSE. CHALLENGES AS MANY OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED- REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS- PLANTER EMPLOYING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES TO ATTEMPT TO PROTECT ACCESS AND THEY'RE CONTRACTED PROVIDERS- WE'VE ALSO INCREASED OUR MEETINGS WITH THE PLANS WE KNOW ME WITH THE MONTHLY. WITH WITH A SMALL GROUP THAT REPRESENTS THE PLANS TO REALLY WORK THROUGH. THE ISSUES THAT ARE OCCURRING- AND REALLY CONTINUING TO DISCUSS WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING COVERED NINETEEN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY REVIEW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND UTILIZATION. AND THOSE OTHER PIECES WILL COME INTO PLAY LATER AS I MENTIONED. NUMBER FOUR WAS WHICH COMPONENTS OF THE- YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THE REAL COMPONENTS OF WORKFORCE PROBLEMS WITH WITH- MANAGE CARE IN THE PLAN. I WOULD SAY THAT- DOCTORS- ARE ALWAYS A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE AREAS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION PUT REPORTS THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE CENTRAL VALLEY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE VERTICALLY CHALLENGE. THERE ALSO SHORTAGES IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THERAPISTS AS WELL AS JUST THE GENERAL COMPETITION FOR DOCTORS BY KAISER ANOTHER COMMERCIAL ENTITY SO I WOULD IT IN TERMS OF THE SHORTAGES THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WOULD BE. POSITIONED AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. NUMBER FIVE WAS- TALK ABOUT PROP FIFTY SIX IN THE PROVIDER LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS- THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS OF GUN DEFINITELY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO PROVIDERS SENSOR INCEPTION- HOWEVER A STUDY THAT WAS DONE ABOUT THE ACA INCREASED A MEDICARE LEVELS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN. DID FIND AN INCREASE IN APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. BUT DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE PROPORTION OF PROVIDERS ACCEPTING MEDICAID PATIENTS. AND I WOULD JUST COMMENT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT YOU KNOW PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN MEDI CAL. OR NETWORK ADEQUACY OF EFFORTS BY DHS ARE QUALITY PUSH PLAN PAYMENT STRUCTURE THEIR PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS- ALL OF THOSE HAVE AN IMPACT ALONG WITH PROP FIFTY SIX. IN TERMS OF AFFECTING WHETHER PROVIDERS DO MEDI CAL. AND THEN FINALLY IS- THE COMMITTEE MAY KNOW THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM WAS- PROVIDED TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN PHYSICIAN AND FORTY DENTISTS ACROSS- MULTIPLE COUNTY IS SPECIALTIES. LAUGHS QUESTION I HAD WAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTRIBUTE GOING FORWARD. I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THIS PERIOD WERE REALLY FOCUSING ON STABILIZING THE NETWORK AND SO AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW ALL THE EFFORTS PREVIOUSLY BY THE HEALTH PLANS. ACTUALLY SEEING THE CARES FUNDING- REALLY ON THE USE OF THE TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITY- AND THE AND THE EQUAL PAYMENT FOR IN PERSON VISITS I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS. NOW BOTH FROM OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY STABILIZING THE NETWORK. I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE LOOKING FORWARD ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON. SHORTAGES THAT ARE IN GENERAL STORE HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE DONE SUBSIDIES FOR PHYSICIANS TO BRING THEM INTO THEIR AREA TO DO MEDI CAL. IT'S A CONTINUING TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS LIKE ABOUT. TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE AND OR GROW AT A LOOK AT WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD. HELLO THERE MY COMMENTS AND- WILL STAY ON THE COURSE AND BE WILLING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR GILBERT NEXT WE HAVE CARMELLA COIL. HE VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THANKS FOR YOUR WORK AND FOR THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOR BEING THERE IT'S SO IMPORTANT- WE ARE IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WITH UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES WHICH CALLS FOR UNPRECEDENTED SOLUTIONS AND ACTIONS. THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY HAD WE'LL KNOW IS REELING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES FOR SOMETIME TO COME AND PROBABLY LONGER PERHAPS THAN ANY OF US WANT TO CONTEMPLATE. HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL CAPACITY ARE CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA WORK FORCE IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS KEY TO RE OPENING THE STATE'S ECONOMY WE CANNOT REOPEN THE ECONOMY UNLESS HOSPITALS ARE BOTH AVAILABLE AND STAFFED. AND IF HOSPITALS CAN'T REMAIN STRONG INSOLVENT WE ARE ALL IN JEOPARDY WHEN CODED RISES AND WE ALL FULLY EXPECT IT WILL AS THE STAY AT HOME ORDER IS LIFTED AND WE BEGIN TO INTERMINGLE AGAIN AND IF CODED RESURGENCE. CALIFORNIA'S CONFIDENCE IN DAILY LIFE CANNOT BE RESTORED UNLESS HOSPITALS ARE FUNDED STABLE AND OPERATIONAL. AND THE SECOND WAY IN WHICH HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY AND THE STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE IS BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA WORKING. HOSPITALS ARE AMONG THE LARGEST PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WE EMPLOY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS A HALF A MILLION. WE SUPPORT ANOTHER ONE POINT TWO MILLION JOBS IN THE STATE AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. HOSPITALS OFFERS SOLID MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WITH BENEFITS AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED AT THE STATE TO RECOVER ECONOMICALLY. BUT THE IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS ON CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE DEVASTATING. AND I AM NOT ONE WHO IS PRONE TO HYPERBOLE. I DO NOT USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY BUT THE IMPACT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING. HOSPITALS WERE ASKED TO PREPARE TWO THIRDS 4250% THAT MEANS TO CARE. FOR THIRTY. AND WE DID THAT WE ANSWERED THAT CALL WE EMPTIED CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS TO MAKE WAY THAT MEANS CANCELING SURGERIES AND PROCEDURES AND MORE IT IS WHAT WE DO AND IT IS AND WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT AS WE BEGIN THE ASSESSED THE DAMAGE OF THE TOLL IS ENORMOUS AND I WILL SAY IT IS A TOOL THAT IS DIFFERENT. THAN THE TOLL TAKEN ON OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THAT IS BECAUSE HOSPITALS HAVE NOT ONLY LOST REVENUE. BUT WE ALSO HAD TO REMAIN OPEN AND FULLY STAFFED AS WE WERE DEALING WITH THIS COVE AND CRISIS. SO HOSPITAL REVENUE LOST. AN AVERAGE OF 2230% WE BELIEVE TO DATE MORE FOR SOME OF OUR SMALLER RURAL HOSPITALS WHERE THE LOSS OF JUST A FEW PROCEDURES OUT REALLY MAKE UP THE BULK OF THEIR REVENUE. THAT LOSSES FOR US. ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT TEN TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES BOTTOM LINE IS HOSPITALS ARE DESPERATE FOR CASH. SO WE'RE ADDING TO THAT THE COST OF COVERT PREPARATIONS AND THAT INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION. THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT WHETHER THAT WAS VENTILATORS WERE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT INTENDED TO KEEP OUR WORKERS SAFE. AND PARTICIPATING IN STANDING UP ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES THESE ADDITIONAL SITES INTENDED TO BE CAN'T HOSPITALS A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS WERE INVOLVED IN- IN SETTING THOSE UP. AND STAFFING THOSE AS WELL. AND ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES OF COURSE DAMAGE HOSPITALS LONG TERM FINANCIAL STRENGTHS. LIQUIDITY HOSPITALS ABILITY TO BORROW HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO TAKE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS AND MORE. SO HOSPITAL TO DONE THEIR BEST TO KEEP STAFF THROUGH ALL OF THIS WE NEED NURSES AN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WORKERS AND RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS AND MANY MANY MORE BUT FOR LOW'S AND LAY OFF HAVE BEGUN. WE HAVE SEEN SOME HOSPITALS NOW BEGINNING TO CUT OURS WERE CHOIR PAID TIME OFF BE TAKEN OR PAY REDUCTIONS AND N SOME CASES A COUPLE OF LARGE SCALE POSITION ELIMINATION. AND THAT IS BECAUSE 60% OF HOSPITALS SPENDING IS FOR LABOR ANOTHER TO PROVIDE CARE SO THREE QUARTERS OF HOSPITAL SPENDING. IS ON THE PEOPLE AND THE THINGS NEEDED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO ALL OF US LEADING HOSPITAL VERY LITTLE ROOM TO DEAL WITH THESE ENORMOUS IMMEDIATE LOSSES. SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO STOP THE FINANCIAL BLEEDING. FEDERAL RELIEF IS NOT ENOUGH. TO DATE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RECEIVED A LITTLE LESS THAN THREE BILLION WE EXPECT THAT OF THE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OUT WE WILL FEATURE A SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COMING TO HOSPITALS. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH MORE AID WILL BE COMING TO HOSPITALS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND AS THEY CONTINUE TO EXPAND NOT CONTRACT THE POOL OF POSSIBLE RECIPIENTS IT IS MAKING HOSPITALS SHARE OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER. SO THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE WILL NEED THE STATE HELP AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY FIRST OF ALL YOUR HELP AND THE GOVERNOR'S HELP IN BRINGING INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS TO THE TABLE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. IT WAS JUST MENTIONED THAT SOME HEALTH PLANS ARE PROVIDING LOANS OR XCELERATED PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ARE SEEING THAT IN VERY FEW CASES MORE IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL LOCAL HEALTH PLANS- BUT FAR LESS IN TERMS OF PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. HOSPITAL SHOULD BE PAID FOR THEIR UNPAID CLAIMS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS INSURANCE COMPANIES RIGHT NOW HAVE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY THAT ARE BEING HELD NORMALLY CLAIMS THAT ARE PROCESSED AND CAN TAKE AS MUCH AS NINETY DAYS. MEANING DOLLARS ARE BEING HELD BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS FOR CARE THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY WE NEED TO MOVE THOSE DOLLARS MORE QUICKLY. AND IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS TO HOSPITALS THAT MONEY NEEDS TO GET TO HOSPITALS NOW. VOLUNTARY ADVANCE PAYMENT PROGRAMS AND EASING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN TO SPEED PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IS ALSO CRITICAL- WE DID INCLUDE THAT IN A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR ON APRIL THE FIFTEENTH THAT IMMEDIATE SHOT OF LIQUIDITY IS NEEDED NOW. AND SECOND WE HAVE REALLY NO CHOICE BUT TO ASK THE STATE FOR IMMEDIATE HELP IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. AND WE ARE MAKING A REQUEST FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE LOSSES. THERE IS MORE AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAT IS NEEDED BUT AS WE STARE AT JUST THE SHORT TERM LOSSES IN THE TEN TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR RANGE. AND MORE AT HOSPITALS WILL BE ASKED OVER TIME TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SURGE CAPACITY. KEEP BEDS OPEN AND EMPTY AND CONTINUE TO PURCHASE AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN COMES BACK ON LINE. THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER THINGS NEEDED TO KEEP US ALL SAFE SHOULD THERE BE A COLBERT RESURGENCE WE HAVE GOT TO SOLIDIFY THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM NOW. SO THERE WILL BE MORE THAT IS NEEDED WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE STATE TO SEEK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IN NEEDED FEDERAL MATCHING DOLLARS DOLLARS THE STATE CAN PUT UP AND THEN DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS. SO WE HAVE TO- REPAIR NOW CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS THEY ARE KEY TO RE OPENING THE ECONOMY AND THE KEEPING PEOPLE WORKING. AND SO APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY- WE REALLY NEED A CALIFORNIA TO. PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS. AND HOSPITALS HAVE PROTECTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU THIS MORNING. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE SERRA SUMMER. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE SUMMER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND POSITIONS THE CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO HERE IS CEO OF THE INMATES PHYSICIAN SERVICES ORGANIZATION WHICH PROVIDES TOLD THEM SERVICES INDEPENDENT ELECTIONS AND SMALL PRACTICES HELPING THEM TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I WANT TO START BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE POSITION WORKFORCE IS FACING AN ACUTE CRISIS. IN A RECENTLY SURVEYED OVER TWO POSITION PRACTICES. BUT WE SALAS PRACTICES OF ALL SIZES THE MODALITIES ARE IN CRISIS. 68% OF PRACTICES HAVE BEEN A DECREASE IN PATIENT VOLUME BUT AN AVERAGE OF 54% DECREASE IN REVENUE. ALMOST HALF OF ALL PRACTICAL ABOUT DIFFERENT LOWER LA OPPOSITION IN FACT. AND MANY POSITIONS ARE GOING WITHOUT A SALARY AND THAT'S ALL THEY'RE ALL WORKING EXTRA HOURS. EVERY WORLD FOR PP AND OFTENTIMES SOUTH QUARANTINING A SEPARATING FROM THEIR FAMILIES EVEN THINKING IN OUR OFFICES. WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING THE POSITION PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RUNWAY OF BOND NOT YEARS. 43% OF CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR HEALTHCARE FROM A SMALL PRACTICE. AND A SMALL PRACTICE IS JUST A SMALL BUSINESS MOST OF WHICH HAVE SIXTY WEEKS A RESERVE AND WE'RE ENTERING WEEK SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THE COPA NINETEEN ENDEMIC. BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO SMALL PRACTICES. ACTIVISM A HUNDRED FIFTY DOCTORS ON THE VERGE OF CLOSURE AND LARGE SYSTEMS THAT HELP FACILITIES. ARE LOW IN FAT. I THANK THE TENDENCY PERCENT OF PRACTICES MAY END UP CLOSING DOORS. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THIRTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO LOSE ACCESS TO THEIR PROVIDER. AND THIS IS WORSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OUR SAFETY. WE ALSO NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE- THIRD. THERE WILL PENNED OF. FOR AND CHRONIC INTO. COUPLED WITH HEALTH IMPACTS FROM SHELTER IN PLACE. DIET AND EXERCISE ROUTINES HAVE GONE BY THE WAYSIDE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES FINANCIAL STRESSES AND FEAR LEADING TO WORK HEALTH OUTCOMES. BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT POSITIONS WILL MAKE UP FOR LOST REVENUE. THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAY AND POSITIONS AND PRACTICES. ALREADY OPERATING AT OR ABOVE CAPACITY BEFORE KOBE NINETEEN. INCREASED SAFETY PROTOCOLS BUDGET PHYSICALLY DISTANT THING PROVIDING INCREASED CLEANING BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS REMOTE TECHNICAL FEATURES AND MORE. THIS IS WILL BE LUCKY TO BE OPERATING AT 50% CAPACITY. PLUS THEY'RE ACTUALLY INCREASED PATHOLOGICAL THE NINETEEN. BUT DOESN'T HAVE TO PURCHASE EXTRA PP IN CLEANING SUPPLIES. OPPORTUNITY OUR PRE SCREEN PATIENTS INSTALL TELL HOW CAPABILITIES AND MORE. IF WE DON'T MAKE AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE NOW ACCESS WILL DECREASE QUALITY WILL SUFFER AND CAUCUS IRAQ IT. ACTIVE WILL DISAPPEAR. THIS IN TURN RETIREMENT WILL RETIRE EARLY AND OTHERS WILL JOIN LARGER MORE STABLE SYSTEMS ARE CORRECT. THIS MEANS LOWER QUALITY WE WILL LOSE LONG STANDING POSITION PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS NOT REPLICABLE OR REPLACEABLE. PRICES LOOK A LOTINCREASED CONSOLIDATION ONLY TO PRICE INCREASES ANYWHERE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT. AND ACCESSIBLE COOPER WE CANCEL GROW PATIENTS WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL FURTHER FOR CARE AND IT WILL HIT RURAL AREAS HARDER AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT GLOBAL POPULATION. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO BOLSTER AND SUPPORT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. WE ASK STATE AND THE PAIR CONTINUE TO PART WITH PARTNER WITH THAT TO REDUCE REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THE POSITION WORKFORCE. WE ASK THE STATE TO PROVIDE PERMANENT TELEHEALTH PARITY WITH CLEARING CONFLICTING GUIDANCE ACROSS LINES OF BUSINESS IMPAIR TIGHT. WE ALSO ASK THAT THEY LIMÃ³N EIGHT OR REDUCE BURDENSOME IN REVERSE IT HAS THE REQUIREMENT THAT JUST PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND COULD ACTUALLY. THE STATE SHOULD IDENTIFY REAP. ANY ON SPEND PROPERTY SIX BACK ATTACK SPENDING. MAINTAINS THE MAINTAIN TO PRACTICE HIS THEIR MEDICAL PATIENT. IF THEY WANT PRACTICES IN DANGER FROM. DECREASE OUR PATIENTS. I THINK TEARS DURING AT THE PAIN AND POURED IF THEY HEALTHCARE. PROMPTLY PAYMENT A CABLE THE POINT ADDITION CANNOT WAY TO STAND THIRTY TO NINETY DAYS FOREVER. LOAN ADVANCED CLAIM PAYMENTS ARE RIGHT. THE GIVEN LONG IN A LIFE AND IT OF A NINETEEN. IT MADE A PICNIC DOWN THE AS MY PROVIDER A PRACTICE WILL NOT BE ABLE GET HIM BACK MONTHS ARE YOU. IF AT ALL. WE ASK. IN FORGET LOAN OR FOR FORGIVE BROADBAND CLAIMS. WE ALSO THE PAIN PROVIDE INTEREST AND IMPROVE ACTIVITY. BUT WE THINK COULD FIT INTO THE EXISTING MLR FRAMEWORK. THERE SHOULD ALSO WHO ARE ACTIVELY RESERVE ARE LEGALLY MANDATED. THAT EXACTLY SUCH AS THIS AND THAT. EVEN THE BAR OF UC DAVIS HEALTH. QUEST THAT I THOUGHT THAT PARTICULARLY. HOW DO WE KEEP. HEALTHY BACK CORNER. IN THE HEALTHCARE. ARE IN. IS TO ME. STERN IN A SUPPORT ARGUE. HEALTH IF THE STOCK. THIS IS ON THE FRONT LINES EVERYDAY. TAKING HER PATIENT. TAKING CARE OF THEIR STAFF AND THEIR- THE LAST THEY SHOULD TO WORRY. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE LUIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A WITH US WITH THE HELP ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH PLAN ACTIONS TO ADDRESS COULD BE NINETEEN. THE ONSET OF THE- CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY SUPPORTING A COMMUNITIES CONSUMERS. AND PROVIDERS. HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN WORKING TO FREE UP CAPACITY IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. COMMUNICATE WITH THE ROLE IS AN INCREASE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH. BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC IS CAUSING FINANCIAL STRAIN FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR COVERT NINETEEN IS BEING COVERED WITH ZERO COPAY YOUR OUT OF POCKET COST. PLANS ARE SUPPORTING LOCAL CHARITIES FACILITATING DELIVERY THE PP PROVIDING FUNDING FOR INCREASED TESTING REACHING OUT TO LOOK VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HELP POINT ALSO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT KOBE NINETEEN IS HAVING ON THEIR CONTRACT NETWORKS. IN RESPONSE MANY OF OUR PLANS ARE USING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS. FROM A SYSTEMIC PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIANS UNIQUE SYSTEM GIVES US AN INHERENT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT IS FUNDED MORE HEAVILY THAN OTHER STATE ON CAPITATED PAYMENTS BY HEALTH PLANS OTHER CONTRACTED PROVIDERS. IN THESE PER MEMBER PER MONTH CAPITATED PAYMENTS ARE PROVIDING A CRITICAL LIFELINE TOO MANY HOSPITAL SYSTEMS MEDICAL GROUPS AND INDEPENDENT PRACTICE ASSOCIATIONS. PLANS CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS AND IN SOME CASES HAVE ACCELERATED THEM. THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO KEEPING FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS OPERATIONAL DURING A PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. ON TOP OF THIS OUR MEMBERS ARE TAKING ADDITIONAL ACTION TO OFFER DIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THEIR PROVIDER. THIS INCLUDES XCELERATED OR DANCE PAYMENTS. FINANCING GUARANTEES THE RESTRUCTURING OF CONTRACTS AND IN THE MEDI CAL SPACE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS OUT TO DO A VARIETY OF BEINGS. INCLUDING HAS THOSE PENSION CREEK- PREVIOUSLY EXPANDED TELEHEALTH CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY FOR CLINICS CENTERS AND PRACTICES. THAT SERVE THE STATE'S MORE HORRIBLE PATIENT POPULATIONS. YOU HEALTH PLAN INVESTMENT DELIVER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT NATIONALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA. CAPTION MEMBERS ARE ALSO PLEASED T SEE THAT BILLIONS MORE IN FEDERAL FUNDING IS BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM. IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN ITS DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS AND RURAL PROVIDERS JUSTICE FRIDAY. AS FUNDING BEGINS JUST TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S PROVIDERS ARE PLANTS HAVE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THEIR CONTRACT PROVIDERS TO EXPLORE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM THIS COULD INCLUDE ACTIONS SUCH AS EXPEDITING CLAIMS PROCESSING ELIMINATING BACKLOGS REDUCING ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER SOLUTIONS. IT BEARS NOTING THOUGH THAT THE WIDE ARRAY OF CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION BUT EVERY PLANNING CALIFORNIA HAS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE PROVIDERS DURING THE CRISIS. TO THAT END CAP HAS BEEN MEETING WITH CMA SEE AJ ATG AND OTHERS TO SORT THROUGH ISSUES AND TROUBLESHOOT PROBLEMS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. OR MORE SYSTEMICALLY AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO A CONTINUING THESE CONVERSATIONS IN PARTNERSHIP. NOW ALL THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING CONDUCTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FISCAL UNCERTAINTY FOR THE PRIVATE MARKETS AND PUBLIC PROGRAM. HEALTH PLANS MUST BE ABLE TO PLAN FINANCIALLY FOR THE INCREASING CARE THIS PANDEMIC. IS BRINGING IN MAY BRING IN THE FUTURE. MEETING KOBE NINETEEN PATIENCE IS LIKELY TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WE HAVE YET TO FULLY SEEN OF THE EXACT COSTS. COVERED CALIFORNIA HOWEVER HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE ONE YOU'RE PROJECTED COSTS IN THE NATIONAL COMMERCIAL MARKET RANGE FROM. THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR COVERT NINETEEN. IF THE ALSO IF THE FIRST OF FOUR YEAR COST OF THIS PANDEMIC HAD BEEN PRICED INTO THIS YEAR'S PREMIUMS BECAUSE FOR TWENTY TWENTY COULD RANGE FROM ABOUT 2% 221% OF PREMIUM. ACCORDING TO ANOTHER COVER CALIFORNIA ESTIMATE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE PREMIUM INCREASES FROM KOBE NINETEEN ALONE COULD RANGE FROM 4% TO MORE THAN 40% NO BEES WIDE RANGES ONLY DEMONSTRATE THE SCOPE IN DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW- AND BEES. YOU KNOW. THIS UNCERTAINTY OF COURSE IS INFLUENCED BY THE AYE CURRENT CODE COSTS. POTENTIAL FUTURE CODE COSTS AND THE RE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. NO NO THAT THE CHILDREN PLACE ORDERS ARE BEING SLOWLY MODIFIED PENT UP MEDICAL DEMAND- WILL EVENTUALLY YOU TWO WERE RESUMPTION OF NON COATED MEDICAL CARE INCLUDING ELECTIVE SURGERY IS. AGAIN HEALTH PLANS MUST BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE TO MEET THIS NEED- IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE PREMIUM IMPACT OF THIS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIABLES TO CONSIDER LIKE. THE TIMING OF RE OPENING THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THE COST OF TESTING AND ANY TREATMENTS INCLUDING POTENTIALLY A VACCINE- AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS PREMIUM COLLECTION AS A RESULT. OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND JOB LOSS. END OF OURSE THE CALL. OF POSTAGE CARE. WE'RE SEEING A TEMPORARY REDUCTION- HAS MENTIONED IN UTILIZATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IT'S A POINT IN TIME IS REASONABLE VERY REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT A PORTION. PERHAPS A LARGE PORTION OF HIS POSTPONED CARE WILL RETURN. FANS WILL NEED TO BE NEED TO BUILD THIS INTO THEIR PRICING FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO UNANSWERED QUESTIONS HERE INCLUDE WILL THERE BE A SECOND WAVE. WHAT IS THE PUBLIC'S WILLINGNESS TO SEEK CARE WHAT WILL THEIR HEALTH STATUS BE WILL BE WORSE AND THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE SO THESE ARE ALL ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF- FINANCIAL PREPARATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED- ON THE STATE SIDE WE NOTICE PANDEMIC A LEADING TO BUDGET UNCERTAINTY AND A CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLAN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH DH CS TO PROTECT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME SO YOU KNOW IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY THE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS WOULD LIKE TO THINK DIRECTORS GILBERTON REGARD FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP THROUGH THIS CRISIS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH DCS INDIAN HC IN THE REST OF THE STATE LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY KEEP OUR ENTIRE HEALTH SYSTEM STRONG INTO THE FUTURE. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NEXT WE HAVE MATT LED. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE INPUT OF WORKERS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE MY NAME IS NOT AS A AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING DOCTORS NURSES ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE SERVING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CODE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. HOW WORKERS HAVE STEPPED UP IN A TIME OF CRISIS AND WE HAVE A DUTY OBLIGATION TO BACK IN OUR WORK FORCE WITH THE FOR. YEAR YOU OFFERS THE FOLLOWING. THE LEGISLATURE ONE A LONG TERM PLAN ON PP. TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS TO UPSCALE OUR SOCIAL WORKERS THREE INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE. FIRST WORKERS HAVE EXPECTED OF ADEQUATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY PERFORM THEIR SCHEDULE JOBS THAT YOU'VE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACT OF WORK. ON WORKERS FOR KOBE NIKE IN THE OPTION OF LEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE CALIFORNIA MUST DEVELOP A LONG TERM PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PLAN. THERE'S A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THATANOTHER PANDEMIC WILL HIT CALIFORNIAN THERE'S NO EXCUSE TO BE UNDERPREPARED NEXT TIME. SO WE CANNOT DEAL WITH THE FUTURE OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORK. UNLESS WE TAKE CARE OF THE CURRENT WORKFORCE SPENDING WHICH INCLUDES ADEQUATE P. P. SECOND AB ARGUE FOR FROM PREVIOUS PANELISTS HOBBLED AND CLINICS ARE LAYING OFF WORKERS TO THERE WERE. LOS EMPLOYERS SHOULD BOUND THERE BUT OFTEN. OF THAT SUCH A IN MY WE WILL WORK WITH EMPLOYEES WHEN WE CAN FIGURE ALTERING SOLELY ALL. WORKERS WILL ALSO BE SUPPORT IN THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT LEAVING. THE VERY WORKERS THAT WE RELIED ON DURING THIS EMERGENCY. WE MUST YOU OPTION WORKERS NOW ENSURE WE ARE AVOIDING LAYOFFS WHENEVER POSSIBLE YOUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. ARE FEATURED CAN GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT. WE HAVE A LONG TERM HEALTH OF. SHORTAGE MORE THAN HUNDRED THOUSAND HEALTH CARE WORKERS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IN ME AND WHAT I FOUND IN WORKFORCE. IS THAT. EMPLOYERS THINKING IMMEDIATE TERM. AND AT THE POLICY LEVEL WE THINK ABOUT IN THE- IN THE LONGER TERM PROJECTIONS. HEALTH JOB DEFENDING SUSTAINING JOBS AND IN ORDER FOR OUR ECONOMY TO RECOVER YOU MUST HAVE A POP WE- STILL ARE CURRENT WORKFORCE AND MAKE NEW WORKERS. TO THESE GREAT POWER. OUT FAILED TO TRAIN WORKFORCE WE NEED REAL X. AND- DELAYS AND THEN OKAY. THIS IS ACUTELY FELT WIRE BUT HEALTH PROVIDER BUT SIR STRUCK BUT ARE IN POWER THERE LOW RUNNING THE NET SERVER FOR PATIENTS. IF WE ALLOW PROVIDE TO CALL DURING THE EARLY STAGES A CRISIS NO MATTER HOW THE NECESSARY. HELP SIR. THE WOMAN IT THE MOST. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE PROGRAM THAT IS OFF CUT IN THAT WAS CUT DURING THE RECESSION. WAS OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM. PROGRAMS WERE CUT BOTH BY THE STATE AND BY. THAT HAVE THE IN WITH FORCING STREAM TO TURN TO FOR SCHOOL TO TRAIN FOR HEALTHCARE JOBS. THE RECESSION FOR PROPER SCHOOLS ARE 100% AND IN A ROW COMPARED TO ROUGHLY MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS TO MAKE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. WE'RE LOOKING FOR HEALTH CARE DEGREES OFTEN DID NOT MAKE MATERIALIZE TO HELP DOC. THE OLD ME STYLE CAL WITH THAT DEBT THAT STILL STRUGGLING TO PAY OFF. I SEE THIS YEAR LET TO MAKE AND ENHANCE. ARE HOPE I. YOU TOO MANY FOR HEALTHCARE WORK IN THE LONG AND THE FACT THAT THEY'LL TURN TO WORKER WITH DAD THE NEW OPPORTUNITY. LASTLY ANOTHER AREA OF THE CREDIT MASS ARE PA HEALTH. WHICH ARE YOU SURE UNDER. IN APRIL TWENTY NINTH. THE TRUCKS UP FOR AMERICA'S HOW ASKING. IT BEING THAT THE PA HEALTH. NATIONALLY WERE UNDER BUT WILL POINT FIVE BILLION AND THAT NATIONAL FIFTY DOLLARS MISSIONS WERE LET. FROM PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. OR CAN CALIFORNIA FUTURE HOW CARE WORK COMMISSION FEBRUARY TWENTY MAKING REPORT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA'S CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED AND MOST LOCAL HELP THE- AGENCY FLOCK THE PERSON NOW WITH YOUR KEY AREAS SUCH AS- THE OPPORTUNITY OLOGY AN ESSENTIAL SKILL TO DESIGN IMPLEMENT. AND EVALUATE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. IN ORDER TO RE OPEN OUR OUR OUR ECONOMY YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE A BROAD SCALE CONTACT TREATING PROGRAM LED BY OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WE WILL NEED TO DEPLOY THOUSANDS OF CONTACT TRACERS CONTRACT THE VIRUS CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO QUELL ANY OUTBREAKS BEFORE THEY TURN INTO EMERGENCY. COUNT WORKERS WILL WHY AGAIN OUR CALL IN A WILLING TO READ TO COUNTY HELP. STORES SUCH WITH CONTACT TREATING COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL NEED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR WORK FORCES. YOU TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO COUNTY QUICKLY HIGHER. MAKES SENSE BOTH FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO MAKES SENSE FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. THE ABOUT TRY REIMBURSEMENT OF UP 275% OR MORE. I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING WE HOPE ALL OUR WORKERS APPRECIATE WRITING BUILDING BLEW TO SUPPORT FAMILY AND RECOGNIZE FRONTLINE WORKERS IN ALL THE ODDS BEING RUN BY A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION RECOGNIZINGOUR WORKERS HEROES. IT IS TIME FOR A FEW MORE THAN TALK WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR WORKERS ACTUALLY SHOW THEM THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE WITH ACTIONS. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THESE COMMENTERS SUGGESTED ME PRESHEAF BUT WE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND I'M HAPPY ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE BETH CAPELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY BETH CAPELL FOR HELP ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ON AN IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT SUBJECT IN A DIFFICULT TIME WE BEGIN WITH THE PREMISE THAT EVERY SINGLE PREMIUM DOLLAR PAID FOR HEALTH INSURANCE IS PAID BY A CONSUMER OR ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS BY EMPLOYERS AND ABOUT A CAL PROGRAM. THOSE DOLLARS ARE ARE MONEY PAID TO HELP PLANS TO GET US THE HEALTH CARE WE NEED WHEN WE NEED IT. AND THOSE OUR SHOULD EITHER GO TO SUSTAIN THE NETWORKS IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME OR BE REFUNDED TO CONSUMERS AND OTHER PURCHASERS THROUGH REBATES AND RIGHT PROTECTION. WE PROUD TO SPONSOR DR REGULAR MEASURE AS WELL AS EARLIER MEASURES THE NECK TO THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATION ON RATE RUBIO. WE HAVE ALSO FOUGHT FOR MANY YEARS TO ASSURE THE CONSUMERS HAVE TIMELY ACCESS ADEQUATE THAT WORKS IN CARE AND THE LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK. THE UNPRECEDENTED REQUIREMENTS OF THE PANDEMIC IS YOU HAVE HEARD IN THE CONSUMERS ARE NOT GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED AND OFTEN NOT GETTING CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. WHETHER IT IS PEOPLE AVOIDING EMERGENCY ROOMS AND THEY MIGHT HAVE A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE OR PEOPLE WHO ARE PUT OFF DESERVES TO MANAGE THE- THEIR CHRONIC CONDITIONS FROM ASTHMA TO DIABETES HEART DISEASE. AND CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS CONDITIONS CONSUMERS HAVEN'T DEFERRED CARE. THE DROP IN VOLUME YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT TODAY FROM THE HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS IS REAL AND SERIOUS AND RAISES QUESTIONS FOR US ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE NETWORKS ON WHICH CONSUMERS PATENT. WE DO WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE% FEDERAL HELP BUT WE ARE TROUBLED BUT THUS FAR. THE HELP THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS NOT BEEN EIGHTEEN GET THOSE. PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ON WHICH ARE MEDI CAL. BEEN ROLE IS. AT THE SAME TIME THE CLAIMS HAVE DROPPED IN THE LAST SIXTY WE HELP CLIENTS AND CONTINUED TO COLLECT PREMIUMS BASED ON THE CLAIMS PAID THE LAST YEAR AND THE COST PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED FOR THIS YEAR. YES YOU HEARD TO DATE SUBCLANS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO ADVANCE PAYMENTS AND PROVIDE OTHER ASSISTANCE BUT MANY HAVE NOT. WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO HEAR ABOUT THE NOTION OF SHIFTING TO CAPITATION AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. AND WE ALSO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TELEHEALTH SO WE WILL NEED TO THINK ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE USE OF TELEHEALTH. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. IN MEETING THIS CRISIS. THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS COORDINATION AND DISCUSSION NOT JUST BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH PROVIDERS BUT INVOLVING POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES. CONSUMERS AND OTHER PURCHASERS WE WOULD NOTE THAT IF CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAD AN OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ELECTED ONE CONTEMPLATED DOCTOR BUT STILL ARE THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL WE WOULD BE USING IT FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND TO UNDERSTAND SYSTEM CAPACITY FROM HOW MANY STAFF DICEY YOU BEDS WE HAD TO THE NETWORK IMPACTS OF THE ECONOMIC CHANGES. AS WE DO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. WE LOOK FORWARD TO A SYSTEM WHERE CARE IS BASED ON. WHERE CARE IS MOST NEEDED NOT WHERE DOES THE MOST. MINIATURE OF OR LUCRATIVE. FIRST PLAN TO RECORD HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS TIMELY ACCESS AND ACCURATE PROVIDER DIRECTORY AND CONSUMER SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT ON NETWORKS BEING THERE ONCE THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. THE REGULATORS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE THE DEPARTMENT'S INSURANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. NEED TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN COUNT ON THESE PROTECTIONS BEING THERE. SECOND PLAN SHOULD HAVE RESERVES THEY'RE SUFFICIENT BUT NOT EXCESSIVE. THIRD CONSUMERS AND OTHER PURCHASERS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND TRUST FUND SHOULD NOT FACE. UNJUSTIFIED RATE SPIKES FROM HEALTH PANS NEXT YEAR OR PRICE HIKES BY PROVIDERS TRYING TO MAKEUP BUT BUT THEY LOST BY CHARGING HIGHER PRICES. AND NO ONE SHOULD FACE A SURPRISE MEDICAL BILL ONE MAY END UP OUT OF NETWORK BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS IN UNDERSERVED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD COME FIRST IN TERMS OF HELP BEING PROVIDED IN PARTICULAR CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ASSURE THAT THE MEDI CAL NETWORKS INCLUDING COMMUNITY CLINICS IN COUNTY HOSPITALS HAVE GOOD RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SERVE THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON THEM AND THE MILLIONS MORE CALIFORNIANS SHORTEN YOUR NEWLY UNEMPLOYED AND TURN. MEDI CAL. AND WE NEED TO MOVE TO A WORLD IN WHICH ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS IMMIGRATION STATUS ALL FAMILIES IN NEED CAN COUNT ON HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE. AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL REQUIRE MORE FREQUENT MONITORING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON VERSUS WHAT WAS EXPECTED. AS YOU HEARD WE CAN EXPECT SOME FINANCIAL REPORTING BOTH IN MID MAY AND AUGUST BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT QUARTERLY REPORTING ON THE IMPACT ON RATES IN THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR AND FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AS WE DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU AND WITH THE CONCLUSION OF PANEL ONE I WILL NOW TURN IT TO MEMBERS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. YES I'D LIKE THANK THANK THE EXCUSE ME HARD TO TALK WITH THIS THING ON SO THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS SO MUCH APPRECIATED- QUESTION. FOR CARMELLA COIL USE YOU STILL ON THE LINE KAMALA. YES I AM SO- I WE HEARD YOUR PLEA FOR XCELERATED PAYMENTS- ALSO HEARD MR LOUISE- SAY THAT THERE ARE XCELERATED PAYMENTS. SO I'M CURIOUS ARE THERE XCELERATED PAYMENTS. BECAUSE I'D FEELING TO DISCONNECT. YES I THINK THAT DISCONNECT- IS IN THE NUMBER OF PLANNED TO ARE OFFERING OPTIONS AND ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS- WE HAVE- AND ARE AWARE OF A COUPLE OF PLANTS WERE OPERATING OFFERING XCELERATED PAYMENTS BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS OF THE MAJORITY OF PLANS- SO XCELERATED PAYMENTS ARE KEY- THIS NOTION OF- PUSHING MORE OF THE INSURANCE DOLLAR. INTO PROVIDERS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL I THINK AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS TODAY IS WE HAVE PROVIDERS HAVE TO SPEND MONTHS WORKING IN RECONCILIATION PROCESS SEES WITH INSURERS AND THEN THE PAYMENT FLOWS WE THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE FLIPPED IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE PAYMENT FLOW FIRST AND THEN WE CAN RECONCILE LATER- BUT WE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE BREAD OR SCOPE OF ASSISTANCE AND HELP. THAT IS NEEDED RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU- MISTER LOUISE US JUST A DIFFERENT QUESTION- ACTUALLY AND THAT'S- HEARD RECENTLY THAT- BLUESHIELD IS ACTUALLY- PLEDGED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP PROVIDERS ARE THERE ANY OTHER PLANS THAT ARE ARE PLANNING TO DO SOMETHING. YES IN FACT THE PLANT HAVE YES BESIDE BLUESHIELD- WHICH ONES I DO. YES THANK YOU LET ME. BY MY NOTES HERE. I'M GONNA GO DOWN THE LIST HERE IN A SECOND. I WILL SAY THAT. IN ADDITION TO BLUE SHIELD ONE PLAN NATIONALLY- UAG ON HAVE DEDICATED A TWO BILLION DOLLAR NATIONAL PUSH FOR XCELERATED PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PROVIDER PARTNERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES CAN FOCUS ON DELIVERING NEEDED CARE ABOUT FIFTY MILLION OF THAT THOSE DOLLARS- ARE DEDICATED TO CALIFORNIA- ANOTHER PLAN IS DOING A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS SYSTEMS PACKAGED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN ACCELERATE CLAIMS PAYMENTS. UNDER THEIR NETWORKS TO HELP ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC- ONE OF OUR PLANS IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IN IS DOCTOR GILBERT- STATED EARLIER SEVERAL PLANS ARE STEPPING UP IN MEDI CAL- BUT ONE OF OUR PLANES DOING ABOUT A SIX MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT MEDI CAL PROVIDERS- IMPACTED BY THE OUTBREAK IN. THAT'S PRIMARILY FOCUS ON TELEHEALTH CAPACITY FOR CLINICS CENTERS AND OTHER PRACTICES- AND I BELIEVE THAT SEVENTEEN THAT DOING THAT- WHAT I DID I DISTRIBUTED A FACT SHEET TO THE MEMBERS OF OFFICES THAT- LIST ALL THE VARIOUS EFFORTS OF THE PLANS ARE DOING ALONG THOSE LINES WITH THAT THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE- ACTIVITIES ARE BEING PERFORMED AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU I JUST. WANNA POKE THANK THEN AND THERE ARE AS WELL OKAY I WANNA POKE THANK. THAT'S AT THE SAVES. EFFORT AND I HOPE THAT OTHERS IN- FOLLOW SUIT- THAT'S IT THAT'S PRETTY BIG ONE- WITH REGARDS TO IN THIS ALSO WITH MR LOUISE AS WITH REGARDS TO TELEHEALTH- I'M HEARING FROM. PEOPLE THAT HAVE FROM FROM PHYSICIANS ACTUALLY THAT- IF YOU'RE PART OF A MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN OR OR OR YOU'RE PART OF AN FQHC. WITH REGARD TO TELL HEALTH- THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING- TELEPHONIC- FEES COMPARABLE THE TELEHEALTH AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR SOMEONE LIKE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE. A LOT OF FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS AND SO- AND OLDER PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE- HARDWARE AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS HOW TO ACCESS TELEHEALTH. SO BUT ANY PRIVATE PRACTICE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SAME. BY THE SAME CONSIDERATION- IS THAT A PLAN BY PLAN DECISION- AND IT FEELS A LITTLE UNFAIR TO THOSE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS- TELEHEALTH- BUT COULD ACCESS. A PHONE. ND THE DOCTOR IN PARTICULAR IS TO SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THAT PERSON IT MAY NOT BE FACE TO FACE BUT IN THESE TIMES IT'S- YEAH I THINK IT WOULD IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO EXPECT A SIMILAR COMPENSATION- IS. CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. SO. I GUESS SO THIS IS THE PAYMENT PARITY ISSUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM GETTING YOUR QUESTION- I'D LIKE TO HIT ON THE HEAD YEAH YEAH SO I MEAN BREAK THE ICE OF THE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AN FQHC OR YOUR- YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING ONE. OF FORM OF PAYMENT BUT IF YOU'RE IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IS A PHYSICIAN. YOU'RE GETTING LESS OR- YOU'RE NOT THERE'S NO ACT THERE THERE IS NO PARITY THERE. IN SOME CASE OKAY WELL I NINE YEAH I KNOW AND I AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I THINK THERE ARE SOME NUANCES THERE THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO INVESTIGATE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS ISSUE FROM EITHER YOU OR YOUR STAFF AND WE REACHED OUT TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT- IN SADDAM'S MORE SPECIFIC OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE HELPFUL. I MEAN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE AGUIAR-CURRY BILL WAS PASSED LAST YEAR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE HAS ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION- I'D HAVE TO REVIEW THE GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHETHER THAT EXTEND OUTSIDE OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKETING TO- EIGHTEEN INTO INTO THE PUBLIC SPHERE. ENCOMPASSES THE PAYMENT RATES FOR FQHCS- IT IF I COULD KNOW THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU SO WE'LL MEMBER NOT TRYING TO. BE OBSTINATE HERE I DON'T KNOW THE TECHNICALITIES OF THE RULE OR HOW WOULD APPLY IN THAT CASE I DO KNOW. THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR PLANS AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE STEPPED UP INDIVIDUALLY. TO JOB. THE INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH. INTO SUPPORT PROVIDERS PROVIDING TELEHEALTH- YOU KNOW BUT I YOU KNOW I DO CAN BE YOU KNOW LOOKING INTO IT AND TO TRY TO RESOLVE- NEAR ANY ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP IN YOUR DISTRICT. THANK YOU AND I HAVE HEARD THAT. SOME OF THE AND THIS IS IN AT THIS POINT ANECDOTAL BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS BUT I HAVE HEARD. THAT SOME OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE SLOWEST. TO ACCELERATE PAYMENTS- WHICH- I FIND PRETTY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH OUR SAFETY NET POPULATION. ALSO DEALING WITH PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR- SO I'D LOVE TO- HAVE YOU EXPLORE THAT AS WELL. HELLO YOU DELETE DOING NOTED THANK YOU- AND THEN FINAL QUESTION THIS IS FOR- SERRA- HOW ARE YOUR DOCTORS THAT ARE IN PRACTICE. ABLE TO GET ANY PP TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT- HOSPITALS ARE GETTING PP COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE GETTING PP- ARM HOW ARE YOUR DOCTORS DOING WITH PP. PRIVATE PRACTICE HE IS AT YEAH THANK YOU TV IS A HUGE PROBLEM BURKE POSITIONS AND PRACTICES ESPECIALLY IN THE SMALLER ONES I THINK WE'VE SEEN THIS AND THEN PRACTICE THAT KIND OF POWER THE LITERAL WORLD TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND ANY I KNOW WE'VE SEEN ADDITIONS ACTUALLY ORDER PP FROM INDIA FROM CHINA FROM SOUTH KOREA- AND ARE SPENDING A LOT OF THEIR TIME ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR IT. COULD BE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND HOW THEY USE PP I THINK WE'VE SEEN WE USE OF PVC IF NOT KIND OF BEST PRACTICES AT THIS POINT BUT THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO KEEP ORDER PATIENT FAITH AND OUR STAFF SAY THE BUG SO IT IT IS THAT IN A THEY AREN'T KIND OF AT THE TABLE PRETY LARGER SO IT MAKES IT HARDER I THINK THEY'RE WORKING WITH EACH OTHER AT THE WORKING WITH- DENTAL OFFICES THAT DONATED OTHER- PRACTICES WERE NOT. BE HAVE BUT IT ONLY IS AN ISSUE NOW KERN AND IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM AS WE START WITH MORE PATIENT CAN REOPEN HEALTHCARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER AND- MY QUESTION IS FOR- MISTER GILBERT NAM HOW YOU DOING MR GOVERNOR WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM SUMMER DEAL COUNTY WORKED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND DOWN IN THAT AREA. MY QUESTIONS ARE- CENTERED AROUND A MENTAL HEALTH- INSANE- THE NEED FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO BUILD- BETWEEN AGENCIES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE- ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. ESPECIALLY SEEN- HERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CONVERSATIONS- THIS MONTH. ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HOW DO WE SEE THIS NEED AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WERE- PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AND BUILDING- THE COMMUNICATION-% THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU MEMBER RAMOS IN THE US- CLUTTER WORKED WITH YOU PREVIOUSLY. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF PIECES OF THAT I MEAN ONE IS HAVING YOU KNOW REALLY INTEGRATED THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. ENTER THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND REALLY MAKING IT AN INTEGRATED PART OF US. THAT HELPS A LOT SO YOU KNOW OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AN S. U. D. TEAM. HAS BEEN REALLY REALLY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WERE WERE ASSESSING HOW THEY'RE DOING WE'VE DONE- A SURVEY OF. WHAT SERVICES ARE ABLE TO DELIVER- BUT AND YOU KNOW CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THEM ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. TO GET FROM NON CMS AROUND THINGS LIKE TELEHEALTH. AROUND TURN INTO CARE SIDE SO THE CARE CAN BE DELIVERED. YOU KNOW IN LOCATIONS THAT ARE NOT YOUR TYPICAL YOU KNOW OFFICE SETTING. AND THEN IN ADDITION THE OTHER PIECES YOU KNOW IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR DELIVERY OF BEHAVE WELL. IT IS THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN. THAT WE PROVIDE THE CARE FOR. WATER TERM TO MY TO MODERATE INTO VERSUS THE SERIES MENTALLY ILL BUT CARE FOR COUNTY SO. OF ALL THE STATE LEVEL THE INTEGRATED UP. YOU KNOW CAN NOW ALL THOSE. TO AND REALLY CAUSED COMMUNITY. WITH YOU KNOW BOTH PARTS OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS. YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS IN MEDI CAL OR CARED FOR HIM IN BOTH- HEALTH PLANS AND BY THE COUNTIES. SO I DO FEEL LIKE IT AT OUR LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL IN OUR IN OUR DEEP CONNECTION. TO THE COUNTIES IN THE HEALTH PLANS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND KEEP THINKING OF WAYS. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HE SEE AND TALK TO AND CONNECT WITH. WHAT THE- PATIENTS AND CLIENTS. AND OF COURSE AS MENTIONED YOU KNOW TELL HEALTH OF HEALTH BUT THAT'LL TURN TO CARE SITES. SO I DO I DO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT LEVEL OF CONNECTION AND INTEGRATION. ALWAYS MORE TO DO- THERE'S ALWAYS THAT MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS KIND OF BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. AND SO YOU KNOW MAKING SURE BOTH THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE COUNTIES ARE TALKING LOCALLY- WHICH IS YOU KNOW IN THE INLANDEMPIRE WAS WAS VERY POSITIVE- SO THAT. INDIVIDUAL THE THEY MOVE AND GET BETTER OR GET WORSE. YOU KNOW OR DON'T ALL BETWEEN THE- THANK YOU THANK FOR THAT AND- pWE KNOW THE THERE'S A BIG NEED THEIR- BUT ALSO NERVE WORLD FULL COMMUNITY. AND AS WE START THE- PROCESS. I WOULDN'T REACHING OUT TO THE- INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES- WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO START TO BRIDGE THAT GAP THAT'S THERE FOR THE NECESSARY RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION- MISTER CHAIR. AND THAT GOES TO- WITH THE HOSPITALS- AS WE START TO HEAR- MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT THAT THE- THE WORKLOAD AND ELECTIVE SURGERIES AND- SOME OF THE- POST SURGERIES- THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED THAT NOW WILL TAKE PLACE TO STRESS TO SEE THAT. THAT COST FACTOR COMING IN- AND SO WE UNDERSTAND- THE BURDEN. THAT'S THERE BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND. THAT IN ORDER TO BE A FISH IN THE WORK FORCE- THAT'S ENGAGED IN THE HOSPITAL'S. ALSO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THAT LONG TERM PLAN. A LONG TERM PLAN OF PP EASE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE THERE. AND THE DOT EVERYBODY- MOVING FORWARD WE SEEN THAT THE SHORTAGE WE HERE- THE NEED AND WE HEARD IN SOME OF THE PRESENTATIONS. OF SOME- PHYSICIANS- GOING AS FAR AS INDIA TO GET. THE NEEDED PPVS WE LOOK FORWARD. LONG TERM PLANNING HOW WILL WE NOW IT JUST FOR THAT HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO START TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE ISSUES FROM THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS PP LONG TERM- AIDS THAT ARE THERE. AS WELL AS THE PHYSICIAN SO I'LL BE LOOKING FOR A SEAT IN. SOME TYPE OF PLAN COME FORWARD AT LEAST AT. THAT TALK ABOUT ALTHOUGH. THERE INCLUDED THE FRONT LINES. THANK YOU NOT QUESTION YOUR APPS RIGHT WE GOT A PROTECT EVERYONE. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT HEALTHCARE WORKERS AT BEST WE CAN- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE JOINED WITH FEI YOU. IN REALLY ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO THINK ABOUT THIS LONG TERM PLAN WHAT SHOULD THE PROCESS LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE REPLENISH AND NOT JUST REPLENISH BUT BUILD UP THE STATE STOCKPILE. AND HOW CAN WE COLLECTIVELY WORK PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR TO THEN ON. AND WHAT WE NEED AND HOW THAT SHOULD BE ALLOCATED FAIRLY SO WE ARE PLEASED TO JOIN WITH ARE AT THE ARE YOU PARTNERS IN THAT LONG TERM PLANNING. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER- CHAIR MINE IS MORE OF A GENERAL I'M A TAKE THIS OFF AS WELL GENERAL OF THE QUESTION OR OR COMMENT I DID SOME WORK LAST YEAR- IN REGARDS TO NURSING STUDENTS I KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE EFFECTS OF THE WORK FORCE YET BECAUSE WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THIS- BUT MY- QUESTION REQUEST- IS I KNOW THAT- WHEN A NURSING STUDENT GOES THROUGH- PULLING THE GARMENT. UP TO DO SO THE CALL OF WORK IN THE HOSPITALS IN ORDER TO BE A TO EARN THEIR THIRD CERTIFICATION HOWEVER BECAUSE OF MBANK THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TAKE THOSE COURSES AND I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR- ROUTE CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN DO SIMULATION RATHER THAN BEING IN THE HOSPITALS FOUR FIVE TO GET BACK TO AYE TRAINING HOWEVER FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE PERCENTAGE IS ALMOST REACHED AND IT'S STARTING UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF NURSES. CAN SEED WITH THEIR CERTIFICATION BECAUSE NOW THEY CAN GET THE TRAINING IN THE HOSPITALS SO IS THERE ANY CONVERSATION OR ANY- JUST COMMENTS ABOUT CHANGING THAT REQUIREMENT GAME I BELIEVE HE CHANGED IT 250% ON THIRD- TRAINING TO BE DONE I COULD BE DONE THROUGH A SIMULATION IF THEY REACH THAT ONE IS THERE A PLAN TO CHANGE THAT OR GOING FORWARD IS DURING THE PLAN ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE NURSES ARE READY TO GRADUATE AS SOON AS THEY THEIR THEIR CLINICAL HOURS. WE MOVE THEM FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK. THE D. UP WORK IS GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC I'M- JUST THINKING AHEAD THAT SOME OF THESE NURSING- NURSES ARE GOING TO BE EXHAUSTED OR OR A LOT OF THEM WILL RETIRE GET OUT OF THE FIELD AFTER THIS- FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND IS THERE ANY PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE NURSING STUDENTS GAP. GET THE APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATION SO THAT WE CAN PLAN FOR FUTURE- WORK FORCE- IF AND WHEN IF THE SURGE DOES OCCUR OR JUST LOOKING FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT NURSES NURSING STUDENTS. ARE CERTIFIED SO IF WE NEED THEM AND THEN FUTURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE IT'S LIKE A LONG WINDED BUT AGAIN BUT THE QUESTION IS- IS DURING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CHANGING THE REQUIRED CLINICAL HOURS- TO DO MORE- THE SIMULATION RATHER THAN IN HOUSE TRAINING. AND IT CANNELLA COIL ON AT EIGHT THINK THAT QUESTION MAYBE OF ME- I DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE DETAILS ON THE LATEST CONVERSATIONS WHEN I CAN SAY IS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CAREFULLY TO TRY TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GET OUR NURSING STUDENTS THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN STRENGTHENING OUR WORKFORCE AT THIS POINT IN TIME AS WE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. OF COURSE IT HAD BEEN ANYTHING- OTHER THAN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AS USUAL- WHICH REALLY MADE IT THIS FAR MORE DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE- THEIR THEIR CLINICAL TRAINING- BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE. HAVE GOT ALL OF THE NURSES YOU KNOW. IT APPEARS TO BE ABLE TO FORCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE'S ANY UPDATE CAN YOU PULL GET THAT INFORMATION TO US I'D BE INTERESTED IN AND SEEING- IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE COULD DO TO HELP- BE IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND- BUILD A CASE FOR EITHER YOU KNOW EXTENDING THE SIMULATION OR MAKING SOME CHANGES. BUT THAT SHE WOULD ARE KEEN EXPERT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OR TO TALK THROUGH THESE THINGS SO I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS SUBJECT IN KEEPING US UP TO DATE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BEING. OF UP FRONT IN GOING FORWARD WITH THIS- VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND WHERE WE'RE AT. IT WITH THE SPEND EMIC BUT MY QUESTION IS AND TO THE PANEL AS A WHOLE. THE LAST YEAR SO WE FOUND THAT THERE'S BEEN OVER A TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIENCY AND FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS RIGHT TO DEMAND. AND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS. WE ALWAYS HAVE SEEM TO HISTORICALLY IN THE PAST- UTILIZE THAT BUDGET LINE TO CUT. HI THIS IS POPULATION- AND HE JUST HAD BEEN IN THE NEAR IN THE NEAR FUTURE RECENTLY AS WE WERE STARTING TO MAKE STRIDES FORWARD NO WAS- LOOKING AT DULY DIAGNOSED INDIVIDUALS WITH NINETY D. INTERNAL MENTAL HEALTH. CONDITION WE'RE SEEING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE HELP FROM THE HEALTH PLANS TO POP YOU HELP THIS POPULATION GOING FORWARD AGAIN THE RATE STUDY ACKNOWLEDGED OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEFICIENCIES- GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH PLANS ARE GOING TO DO FOR THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION OF AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO COME TO SOME SOLUTION A BECAUSE- WE CAN'T DO IT IS A STATE OBVIOUSLY WITH BUT END UP THANK COMING FORWARD. IT'S GOOD A VILLAGE I WANNA KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH THAT. I THINK THE QUESTION MAY BE DIRECTED AT UNIVAC SINCE HE SPOKE ABOUT THE PLANS BUT MOST OF THAT MAY BE- AND CAN BE SAFER DIRECTOR BARGE MEN DURING- DDS AND THE NEXT PANEL. WANTED TO SEE IF- NECK YOU HAD ANY COMMENTS ON. YEAH NO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER AND MISTER CHAIR INS NO WHILE- YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS TREATMENT PARITY ON IT IS ESTABLISHED FIRMLY LAW BOTH AT THE STATE. I'M IN FEDERAL LEVEL- YOU KNOW. ENSURING THAT WE ALL HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE PEOPLE NEED TO DELIVER ON ON THE PROMISE OF YOU KNOW SERVING THIS VOLATILE POPULATION IS. IS CRITICAL IT IN AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WE ARE NOT ONLY AMONG STATE LEADERS HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS. ON END AND OF COURSE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ADVOCATES AND- WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- ARE THERE CHALLENGES THAT YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY THEIR CHALLENGES AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES. YOU KNOW THE OUTLINED IN A TWENTY NINETEEN YOU KNOW WORKFORCE REPORTS THAT. CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE 50% FEWER PSYCHIATRISTS AND 28% FEWER PSYCHOLOGIST. M. F. T. USE AND LICENSED COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS AND SO. THAT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THAT CHALLENGE MIGHT BE EXASPERATED EXACERBATED THAT IS. USE ME YOU KNOW BY THE BY THE EFFECTS OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ENVY ARE YOU KNOW. A TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN OF MEDICAL SYSTEM WHICH IS AGAIN HOLY REOPENING SO- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO DIE YEAH WORK WORK WITH YOU ON YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD- YOU KNOW WE- EATING IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE SO- IT'S A GOOD QUESTION SOMETHING THAT- THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT AND- YOU KNOW LOOK FOR HAVING. RESERVATIONS ONCE THE DUST HAS SETTLED- AND- AND WE GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE LANDSCAPE ONCE OUR ECONOMY AND MEDICAL SYSTEM OPEN UP AGAIN. THANK YOU AND- IF I MAY SINCE WE HAVE- ANSWERED AND ASKED ALL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE CHAIR. AND I'D LIKE TO START IF I CAN WITH- THE LA IS OFFICE AND YOU- BEN JOHNSON. BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU LAID OUT THE PROBLEM QUITE WELL AS YOU NORMALLY DO. THAT THERE WERE INCREASED COSTS THAT WERE ATTRIBUTED FROM- PP OR FROM OVERTIME TO HAZARD PAY FOR PROVIDERS. AS WELL AS MODIFYING FACILITIES THAT CAME WITH COPA NINETEEN. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD REDUCED VOLUME OF SERVICES AND REVENUE LOSSES OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOW YOU HAD MENTIONED- MISTER JOHNSON THAT IN THE FEDERAL CARES ACT THERE WAS THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN RELIEF AND YOU ALSO STATED THAT THE FEDERAL- FQHCS HAD RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN A SEPARATE POT OF MONEY. AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP DOORS OPEN AND PEOPLE EMPLOYED. BUT I THINK MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS FOR HOW LONG. HOW LONG CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT THAT IS- OCT I QUESTION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FIRM ANSWER TO- BOTH ON THE COST SIDE IN THE REVENUE SIDE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE- A LOT. ACTUALLY THE FISCAL IMPACT ARE HOPEFULLY IN THE COMING MONTHS YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- ON PROJECTIONS WITHIN THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM AND OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT COULD- SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THE EXACT REVENUE AND COST- IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN AND AT THAT TIME- YEAH NOW IS IT EVEN IF IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE COULDN'T HAVE THAT TODAY. AT THAT TIME THAT WE COULD REALLY BETTER I THINK UNDERSTAND- DOES THAT SORT OF. IF YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM THAT NEEDS THAT IS. ACTS ARE GOING TO- BECAUSE PROVIDERS TO NEEDED YOU KNOW WE THINK WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GONNA ONE MAN OPENED OUR OPEN BACK UP SO COLLEGE GUYS THAT COULD NOT SORT OF CLEAR INFORMATION AT THIS TIME BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR- ASWE AS WE EVALUATE THE BUDGET AND THE SITUATIONON THE GROUND. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE MODEL OF- THIS IS- RETROSPECTIVE AS WE HAVE TO EVALUATE **** HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF SPENDING. BUT DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK TO SOMETHING THAT NICK LOUISE US HAD SAID WHEN HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NOT SEEN COSTS INCREASE YET SO FAR FOR THE PLANTS. THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY WAS A TEMPORARY REDUCTION. AND WITH THAT I'M TRYING TO BALANCE WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE HOSPITALS WHO SAY THEY'RE HAVING DEVASTATING FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY SAYING THAT THERE ARE FOR ALLOWING EMPLOYEES AND CLOSING DOORS. AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF I COULD AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT DIRECTOR REALLY AREN'T OR DIRECTOR GILBERT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. YOUR COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT THESE ARE TEMPORARY CLOSURES. AND YET I'M TRYING TO REALLY GET AT THE FINANCES HERE. IS ÂRE FOR A MEDIA SUPPORT OF OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO HELP US BLUEY THROUGH THIS CRISIS. LIKE I CAN START BECAUSE OF THE- DOCTOR GO OVER TIME AND I THINK. I WOULD I KNOW CARMELA'S TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE VARIOUS PLANS BUT I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT A- GRID IN FRONT OF ME OF THE ACTIVITY FROM. THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ADVANCING PAPER PERFORMANCE CAPITATION ARE CLAIMS PAYMENT ADVANCES CHANGING FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CAPITATED REMEMBER AND- THAT MANY OF THE PROVIDERS MANY. SOME ARE PULLED MANY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE ALREADY CAPITATED AND THEREFORE WOULD NEVER DECREASE IN INCOME YOU KNOW BASED ON UTILIZATION. EXPEDITING PAYMENTS- YOU KNOW PROVIDER GRANTS XCELERATED CLAIMS PAYMENT SO. WE ARE SEEING A FAIR AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY ON THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SIDE OF PLANS TRYING TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS WHETHER IT'S CLINICS. HOSPITALS PRIVATE PROVIDERS BETTER- BUT I'VE GOT A YOU KNOW FERMENTED DETAIL ON ON THEM PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT. TO YOUR POINT THOUGH I THINK THERE IS A CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW CLOSURES THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW. YOU KNOW KAISER CLOSING CLINICS IN CONSOLIDATING SOME FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE NIXON ERICA. CLOSING ONE OR TO CONSOLE THEIR EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT- SO THEIR TEMPORARY. AND PAUL COMES BACK ACTIVE STARTED THAT. THAT THEY WOULD RE OPEN BUT WE CANNOT BE ASSURED OF THAT AND THAT TO ALL THE POINTS BY SERRA IN CARMEL ANOTHER'S. VERY CONCERNING SO. I WOULD SAY YES FOR UTILIZATION DECREASING PLANTER RESPONDING TO THAT CERTAINLY ON THE MEDICAL SIDE- AND WE HOPE THAT WILL HELP SUSTAIN THE NETWORKS AND IN KEEPING VIABLE. MR CARE THISIS SHELLY RELIED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE JUST TO RESPOND AND TRY TO ECHO WHAT DOCTOR GILBERT WAS JUST SAYING WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAMP ACTIVITIES- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE ACTIVITIES VERY BY PLAN WE HAVE SOME PRETTY SMALL PLANTS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO USE SOME OF THAT- ADVANCE. AND THEN THINGS THAT ARE THE PROVIDERS TO BE REFLECTED BUT THERE ARE PLANS THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THAT ARE- TRYING TO GET THOSE BACK CLEAN HEY IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- AND TRYING TO- REDUCE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PARKING YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY CAN GET MONEY OUT QUICKER- NICOLINO TO REFERENCE- SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM HELP AND THAT IS. SHORT TELEHEALTH PARTICULARLY. FOR THE CLUB AND PROVIDERS TO FOR LARGE POPULATION OF MEDICARE PROVIDERS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE. THAT THAT'LL IT DOES VERY WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TO THE PLANTS AT THE POINT TO SPEND THEIR A- OF THEM THE WAY THEY WHICH THEY ARE. THE PROVIDERS WITH LIKE THEM BUT WE WILL AS I SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW BE LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL WILL BE ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING HOW THEY'RE DOING IT AND WHERE THE MONEY IS. IS GOING AND THEY WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO- RAMP UP. PAYING FOR CARE ONE. WE KIND OF GET THROUGH THAT THE RIGHT NOW. IF I MAY ALSO RESPOND TO OUR DOCTOR WOULD QUESTION ABOUT TELEPHONIC- VISIT- WE THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED AND ALL PLAN LETTER LAST MONTH THAT ACTUALLY ABOUT A MONTH AGO- DIRECTING HEALTH PLANS TO PAY. UP FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES WHETHER IT'S BY VIDEO OR BY PHONE- AT THE SAME RATE THAT THEY WORK FOR AND- IN PERSON DOES IT SO IF YOU HAVE AND THAT'S IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD PARTICULARLY ON THE TELEPHONIC THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT RULES FOR MEDI CAL WITH. CALIFONE. SO IF THERE ARE PROVIDE HOW THOSEPROBLEMS IN THEY SHOULD COME. OUR BUT SO AND SEE AN AD AND- AMERICAN COME IN A MET. THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THE BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN ENTER WHILE. YEAH I WOULD BE A DOCTOR BUT TO THE THAT. MEDI CAL THIS. THE TELEPHONE IS AVAILABLE IN PAID THE SAME RATE AS IN PERTH VISIT% ATTEMPTING IN A NUMBER OF THIS DONALD THE FACT. AND IF I MAY DIDN'T. PRESUME THAT WE COULD DIRECT THE PLANS HOW TO SPEND BUT MUCH LIKE CARMELLA STATED IN HER TESTIMONY. I WOULD WANT TO EMPOWER THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS GOVERNOR TO BRING THE PLANS TO THE TABLE. TO HAVE A FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEEDS OF OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR STATE. BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO LISTEN TO THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES BEING HEROES DOING THE WORK NOW. WHEN OUR HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS ARE STATING CLEARLY TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NEEDS I BELIEVE WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM IN THE MOMENT. AND I THINK MY QUESTION IF I COULD IS. GOING TO BE DIRECTOR THAT YOU NEXT- HOW COULD WE ENCOURAGE MORE TIMELY PAYMENTS HOW COULD WE- ALLOW PLANS TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT NEEDS OF. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND RESPOND IN A MOMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION- I THINK OUR MEMBERS DO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS- AND AS I STATED IN MY OPENING REMARKS- OUR DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR- OUR STAFF HERE AT CAP. ON HAS BEEN IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE- PROVIDER TRADE ASSOCIATIONS OF NOT JUST TO SORT THROUGH CASE BY CASE SCENARIOS BUT- TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE MORE A GLOBALIST TAKE ISSUES- THAT YOU'RE REFERRING SO- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE- YOU KNOW. THINGS GET. RICKY IS YOU KNOW WHEN WE START GOING DOWN THE PATH THAT- OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EITHER RISKY AT BEST OR- YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE AT WORSE AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE TO TREAD VERY DELICATELY HERE I MEAN HEALTH PLAN GOT A LEGAL OBLIGATION- TO- MAINTAIN THEIR SOLVENCY UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT AND I THINK ANY RASH DECISIONS WOULD BE- WOULD BE VERY PROBLEMATIC I MEAN THE SOLVENCY OF COURSE IS A BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION I MEAN IT ENSURES ENROLLEES. OUR CLAIMS ARE PAID- AT PROVIDERS YOU KNOW DON'T SUFFER UNPAID CLAIMS AND POTENTIALLY- CONSULTANCY ON THERE AND- WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ME WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF JOB LOSS GONNA BE AND IN THIS IN THIS IDEA THAT HEALTH PLANS YOU KNOW OUR COULD COLLECTING THE SAME LEVEL OF PREMIUMS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING YEAR IS NOT NECESSARY WE TO. ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS WE BELIEVE CAUSING A SHIFT OF EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE TO EITHER SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE TO COVER CALIFORNIA FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE OF- ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO MILLION- ENROLLEES- IN THAT PROGRAM SO YOU KNOW IT IT WILL SOON AT LEAST COME PLAY. IN SOME IF NOT ALL IT'S MY ACTUALLY BE LESS PREMIUM AS RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE CORONA SO YOU FACTOR THAT IN YOU FACTOR IN THE UNKNOWN COST OF CARE ONCE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM REOPENS YOU FACTOR IN THE UNKNOWN COST OF THE OF THE SECOND SURGE. IF PEOPLE WANT TO HER- AND EDUCATED STATED YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL HAVEN'T COME IN FOR BE COVERT NINETEEN RELATED COSTA WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SO WE KNOW HOW EXPENSE THAT IS- SO I THINK THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY REALLY CAREFUL- DUE TO ALL OF THESE UNKNOWNS AND ENDS AND. YOU HAVE TO THE PLANT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PLANT MY IN ORDER TO CARE. OF THE BEAST. COSTS IN IN THE IN. CHECK THIRD FOURTH QUARTERS OF THIS YEAR- SO WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE. CONVERSATIONS BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE REASONABLE AND A AND- YOU KNOW AS THE DIRECTOR YARD SAID EARLIER. EACH PLAN IS DIFFERENT IS SITUATED DIFFERENTLY- SOME OF THEM ARE SMALL READABLE REGIONAL THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL. OF FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO DO THE SAME THING THIS SUMMER BIG PLANS DO. AND SO EACH PLANET IS DOING WHAT THEY CAN WITH IT YOU KNOW WITHIN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO- YEAH I IT YOU KNOW. IN OUR DOORS OPEN WE'VE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS. I AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO CONTINUE AS CONVERSATIONS. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT WILLINGNESS TO- HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T- SHARE THOUGH THAT- THAT PART OF YOUR CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITY IS ALSO TO PROVIDE NETWORK ADEQUACY AND- TIMELY RESPONSE AND SOME OF THAT IS IN QUESTION IF OUR ACCESS AND SERVICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. IF OUR CLINICS ARE FURLOUGHED OR PLOY THESE ARE ARE FURLOUGHED AND OUR CLINICS ARE SHUT DOWN I HAVE A WORRY. THAT OUR PREMIUMS WILL NOT GO TOWARDS THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. AND SO I DO BRING A BIT OF- BATH COMPELS APPROACH TO THIS WHICH IS THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION THIS IS OUR MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PREMIUMS ARE GOING OWARDS. HELPING TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MOMENT AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR ORGANIZATION TO. SUPPORT AS BEST YOU CAN THE PRACTICES THAT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT. OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DOING SUCH AS TIMELY PAYMENTS SUCH AS CAPITATED PAYMENT SUCH AS LOANS TO. PROVIDERS THESE ARE THINGS THAT CAN HELP US TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE MOMENT AND SO WOULD JUST ASK US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE RIGHT NOW FOR US TO SUPPORT OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THAT I WILL THANK THE DOCTOR WOULD ACTUALLY. WELL YOU HAVE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING- ONE FINAL QUESTION AND THEN- AND THIS IS A QUESTION- FOR CARMELO BUT I WANT TO FRAME THIS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE I ASK THE QUESTION. WE KNOW THAT- THE HOSPITALS ARE FACING- SIGNIFICANT- DEADLINES AND PUT AN X. AND LARGE EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SEISMIC RETROFITS- I THINK OF- DOCTOR ARAMBULA HAS A HOSPITAL IN THE PHRASE IN THE FRESNO COUNTY. THAT 90% OF THE HOSPITAL IS EITHER MEDICARE OR MEDIC CAL. AND THE COST FOR THE SEISMIC RETROFIT IS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IF THEY WERE TO REBUILD THE HOSPITAL IT WOULD BE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AT A TIME WHEN REVENUE IS- SHE HAS BEEN SHAKEN SO BADLY THAT- HOSPITALS ARE LAYING OFF. I BELIEVE AND I I'M I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS NUMBER STICKS IN MY MIND BUT IT DOES. THAT TOTAL COST TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM- HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. SO I ASKED THIS QUESTION IN A BUDGET- SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. OVERSIGHT HEARING TWO WEEKS AGO- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- I WANT TO ASK- TO- OUR FOLKS AT- DH CS- IN ANYBODY ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS ANSWER. AFTER I GIVE CARMELLA CHANCE TO ANSWER- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS I THINK THAT- WE HAVE HOSPITALS ARE ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE HOSPITALS IT WILL NOT SURVIVE. AND THIS- YOU KNOW WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE DEADLINE OR SOME RESTRUCTURING OF WHAT HOW WE LOOK AT SEISMIC RETROFITS- WE'RE GONNA LOSE HOSPITALS- GOING FORWARD AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED THEM THE MOST- CARRILLO I KNOW YOU. TALKED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLAR ASK- IS THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE AN ASK AROUND SEISMIC- BECAUSE I AM REALLY CONCERNED- IN ONE OF MY HOSPITALS IN IN OUR HUMBLE COUNTY- IT'S WITH STOOD- EARTHQUAKES IN THE SEVEN POINT OH RANGE- AND NEVER LOST A DAY OF SERVICE FOR EARTHQUAKE- BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE. YES THEY MAY HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND THAT THEY ARE FACING HUGE COSTS FOR- FOR RETROFIT SO- IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE ABOUT THE STATE AND OBVIOUSLY WANT PEOPLE TO BE SAFE- HOWEVER- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE AT A POINT. OF DO WE BANKRUPT HOSPITALS- OR DO WE- TO WE TRY WE DO DO WE- TAKE A LITTLE BIT A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT APPROACH SO THAT WE CAN KEEP HOSPITALS OPEN SO. I GUESS I'D LIKE TO HAVE CARMELO- COMMENT ON THAT AND THEN I'M OPEN TO- TEAMMATE CD EIGHT C. S. WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR WOULD FOR THE QUESTION- YOUR NUMBERS ARE SPOT ON- THE CITIES ARE A COST ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING THE TWENTY THIRTY. SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS THAT EXCEED A HUNDRED BILLION THAT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER. AND WHILE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT CHALLENGE. AND THE INCREDIBLE- DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO MEET THAT BEFORE CODED. IT REALLY BECOMES AN IMPOSSIBILITY GIVEN WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES AT THIS JUNCTURE. AND SO I WHILE WE'RE ALL VERY FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL FIELD. THIS TEN TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS WITH INSURERS IT IS TIME FOR ACTION NOT CONVERSATIONS. IT IS TIME FOR SYSTEMATIC CHANGE NOT CASE BY CASE. EVALUATIONS BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S NOT JUST THE SHORT TERM IMPACT. ON THE HOSPITAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT IS THE LONG TERM DEPLETION OF THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THAT SYSTEM. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE SEISMIC RETROFITTING. THAT REQUIRES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR A HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BOND MARKET. BORROW MONEY TO DO THAT CONSTRUCTION. ALL OF THOSE THINGS REQUIRE A SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION. IS REQUIRED. TO GET LIQUIDITY IN DAYS CASH ON HAND IN ORDER FOR A BOND LENDERS TO BE WILLING EVEN WHEN THE HOT. TO DO A PROJECT OF THIS ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE COVERT NIGHT INNKREIS. THE ONLY HAVE WE TO PLEASE BE IMMEDIATELY. OF WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR LAW TERM FIND. OUTLOOK AS WELL AND I'M CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FICTION MOVIES AND OTHERS I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS OVER TIME BUT EVEN THE FEASIBILITY OF BORROWING MONEY TO BE ABLE TO THINK OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OF THIS ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. ADJUST DOESN'T ALIGN WITH THE REALITY TO HAVE THAT WE HAVE TODAY SO IMMEDIATE NEED IS LIQUIDITY- SHORT TERM INJECTION OF CASH INTO THE SYSTEM. LONGER TERM WE'VE GOT TO REBUILD THAT FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND I JUST DON'T SEE THE FEASIBILITY OF A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PLUS ON TOP OF THE LOSSES THAT WE'RE FACING AND WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD TO PROTECTTHE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA MOVING AHEAD. DOCTOR WOULD IT BRAD GILBERT FROM DID SHOW UP ABOUT WILL TAKE I'LL TAKE THAT BACK TO THE MAIN GOAL OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS BESIDES. DH YET FOR SURE SO WE SHOULD- QUESTION AND COMMENT ALL I'LL TAKE IT BACK. MICHAEL J. FROM PROCEEDING- EDU LONG BAD OF A PROPONENT OF THE STANDARDS BECAUSE WE AS BEING THE IMPACT OF NOT. PREPARING FOR POTENTIAL EMERGENCY OUR WORK FORCE ATTACK YOU SEE THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE SHORTAGE EP. SO YOU KNOW WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE FINANCIAL POSITION THE HOSPITAL THEN WE'D LIKE THAT YOU KNOW CONSIDER. WORKING WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE TO MEET THE STANDARDS- GIVEN THAT HE'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS SO- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BAD. YOU THINK THAT THE STANDARDS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU CANNOT PREPARE FOR EMERGENCY ONCE IT HAPPENED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITH THE IF I MAY I THINK THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ROBUST AND I DO THINK WE WOULD BE REMISS. AGAIN NOT TO THANK OUR GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. I THINK WE WOULD BE IN A MUCH DIFFERENT POSITION RIGHT NOW HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH HOSPITALS. AND PROVIDERS IF IT WERE NOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING. AND DO BELIEVE IT NOW ALLOWS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE PLANS. BUT WOULD AGREE WITH CARMELLA FOR THE NEED FOR URGENCY. THAT TO MANY OF OUR CLINICS RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO HAVE THEIR DOORS OPEN TO HELP US TO. ACT AS PREVENTATIVE CARE HAS IT IS THE BEST TYPE OF CARE WE CAN DO. SO WITH THAT WE WILL THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR PANEL NUMBER ONE AND NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER TWO. AS WE DO I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THERE IS A CLUSTER OF QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA THAT DESCRIBE THE FOCUS OF PANEL TO. WE HAVE ASKED OUR PANELISTS TO RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS AND TO FOCUS ON HOW THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. ARE RESPONDING.

IN NEW APPLICATIONS AS MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE JOB LOCKED IN GROWING CHALLENGES ACROSS. OTHER ADDED- CURRENT RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE SEEN AT THE LOCAL COUNTY LEVEL THIS INCREASE- AT THE SAME TIME- IMPACTING OUR COUNTY STAFF WHO ARE ALSO IMPACTED DUE TO SCHOOL CLOSURE- ILLNESS AND WHO ARE NEEDING. TO LIMIT THEIR IN PERSON CONTACT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO IN. MANY FLEXIBILITY CROP THESE PROGRAMS AB FOR EXISTING RECIPIENTS SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR SUPPORT. I'LL TO REDUCING WORKLOAD FOR COUNTIES ALLOWING THEM TO PROCESS THE SURGEON APPLICATION IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IN DOING THAT CAN TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION. THE GOVERNOR ALSO WEIGHED CERTAINLY PUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW COUNTY THREE DIRECTOR DRESS THE INCREASE APPLICATION THROUGH AT STOPPING THE COW WORKS FORTY EIGHT MINS TIME CLOCK FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH THIRD JUNE. I WITH RESPECT TO FOOD AND NUTRITION WE'RE PROVIDING A NUMBER OF SUPPORT INCLUDING EMERGENCY FOOD THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FEEDBACK PARTNERS. ALSO PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH CALTRANS PANDEMIC AB T. OUT TO MILLIONS ACROSS OUR STATE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO MANY OF THE EFFORTS THAT I JUST OUTLINED HAVE BEEN IN PARTNERSHIP- THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND ARE AT SECTION THIRTY SIX LETTERS THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO QUICKLY AND SWIFTLY. I RESPOND TO THE CRISIS AND AS WE NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. SO I WILL GO INTO THE QUESTION THE AD THAT YOU HAVE HEARING FUNDS AND THE FIRST ONE BEING OUT HOW OUR ACCOUNT A RECESSION AT THAT PARTY PROGRAM HOW WORKING HOW FRESH WORKING DURING THIS TIME. AND WHAT ARE WE SEEING IN TERMS OF THAT LIMITATION IS THAT I JUST MENTIONED INTO ENTERED THE COUNTY OFFICE CLOSURES. AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THE NEW APPLICATIONS IN BOTH PROGRAMS AT THE COMPARISON IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR. EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FAMILIES APPLY FOR CAL WORKS. AT THAT NUMBER THIS YEAR WITH FOURTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES APPLYING. FOR CALIBRATION AT MARCH OF LAST YEAR THIRTY NINE THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL THE PRIDE. AND THAT NUMBER THIS YEAR IS ALL THE WAY TO NINETY SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THE MORE THAN DOUBLING YOUR SCREEN WE'RE STAYING ACROSS THE BOARD- IN INDIVIDUALS LOOKING TO ACCESS THESE PROGRAMS. WE HAVE BEEN SERVING COUNTIES TO DETERMINE- WHAT- SERVICES IN CAPACITY THEY HAVE. ENTERED THE MEETING WITH NEED WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL CLICK AGAIN FLEXIBILITY IS TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING RECIPIENTS CAN MAINTAIN AID. BUT WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING IN CONNECTING AT DUE TO THEIR NEW TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT THIRTY SIX COUNTIES ADDITIONAL COUNTIES COMING ON IMPLEMENTING ELECTRONIC INTERVIEWING AT APPLICATION. WE ARE BEING AT MANY TELEPHONIC AND WEB BASED SOLUTIONS ONLINE QUARTER PULLED PORTAL AND ALSO A DROP BOX WITHIN MAIL SLOTS WITH PEOPLE APPLICATIONS READ ANYTHING AT DRIVE THRU HOURS WERE AT INDIVIDUAL BEGAN. TO SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING CAN PROVIDE THEIR INFORMATION I TO THE COUNTY STAFF THOUGH A LOT HAPPENING AT IN THAT. SPACE MEDITATION ACROSS THE BOARD. IN TERMS AT THAT SECOND QUESTION I HAVE THE OF POLICY TO THAT. LIKE THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED I JUST WANT TO GET A GOOD KNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS- WORK- MATCH AT THIS FLEXIBILITY THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PRVIDE HAS REQUIRED EXCUSE THAT MAKE THEM PREPARE FEDERAL WAIVERS AND WANT TO. THANK OUR PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO FOR QUICKLY VERY VERY QUICKLY EXPEDITING THE APPROVAL OF MANY OF THESE. I REQUEST AND ALSO OF COURSE TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AT THE GOVERNOR IN MAKING CHANGES. WE HAVE IN HEALTH FRESH- WE HAVE A TEAM THEIR REPORT WAY FOR EXTEND CERTIFICATION PERIOD SO IT'S- INSURING THAT CALPERS RECIPIENTS DO NOT NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR MARCH APRIL OR MAY SEMI ANNUAL REPORT. FOR ANNUAL RE CERTIFICATION TO CONTINUE BENEFITS THEY'RE BY REDUCING ANY TURN IN THE PROGRAM. I FELT THAT CAPITA RECIPIENTS- THE- CERTIFICATION- WILL BE DONE ON THE SIX MONTHS. SIX MONTHS CERTIFICATION CARRIED EXTENSION. FOR INTER WAIVERS HELP FRESH APPLIQUE APPLICANT NOT YOU CAN AN INNER IF PROVIDE. I TO BE TO. AND OTHER REQUIRED PROOF INCLUDING PROOF OF EARNINGS WITH THEIR APPLICATION. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED WE SING TELEPHONIC SIGNATURE- ACROSS THE BOARD WERE ALSO- POSTPONING BEEN REVIEWED IN TERMS OF OUR QUALITY CONTROL PROPHESIED. I IN TREMENDOUS ADMIT DIFFERENCE AS HAPPENED IN THE CALPERS SPACE IS THE ABILITY ASK FOR CALPERS RECIPIENTS TO UTILIZE THEIR EBT CARD FOR ONLINE PURCHASING WE'RE STARTING WITH THE AMAZON AND WALMART AND LOOKING TO. EXPAND TO OTHER RETAILERS BUT THE BEGIN ALLOWS FOR HOMES. ONLINE PURCHASING IN HOME DELIVERY AS AS FOOD WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE THAT IT FOR INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO REMAIN AT HOME. IN ADDITION WE HAVE AGAIN AS I AS I REFERENCE THAT THAT TIME CLOCKS AND CAL WORKS WE STOPPED AT HOWARD FORTY EIGHT MONTH TIME CLOCK FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH APRIL MAY AND JUNE. AT **** WITHOUT FORTY EIGHT MONTHS OR WHO HAD FEWER THAN FORTY EIGHT MONTH IN MARCH- AS WELL THERE'S A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THAT HOW WORK THERE'S BEEN MATTER EXECUTIVE ORDER AT THAT WAS RELEASED JUST LAST WEEK- IN THE GUIDANCE WILL BE COMPORT COMING THIS WEEK. AT PROVIDING SOME- ADDITIONAL APPLICABILITY THE CROP THIS PROGRAM IN TERMS OF INTERVIEWING ALBUM I WOULD VERIFICATION FELT ACTIVATION. AT DIVERSION AND MORE. ALTHOUGH ONE COULD NOT THAT WE- LAUNCH ARE POWERFUL INITIATIVE WHICH IS A CRITICAL VOLUNTARY AS SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES ACROSS OUR CASELOAD IN FAMILIES AND- WILL HAVE MOVED THAT THAT CONTINUE THAT THE PORT COLLUDED TO A TELE HEALTH OR TELL US- CALL INFO. AGAIN THAT CONTACTED THE MAINTAIN CAN BE DONE THE VIDEO CALL TEXTING AND MESSAGING- AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE SURE THAT SUCH POINTED OCCURRING BETWEEN HOME VISITORS AND FAMILY. AT TO CONNECT THEM TO ANY RESOURCES THAT THEY MAY NEED. IN TERMS OF POWER STAGE ONE. CARE WE'VE MADE SOME CHANGES IN AWAITING ATTENDANT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. HOW WAITING FAMILY FEES AND ALSO EXTENDING THE TRUCK BLIND AS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND PROCESS TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL TIME. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION TO SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE CLOSED FOR THIRTY DAYS AT LOOKING TICKET. AGAIN PRESERVE THE CHILD CARE ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE- AND I'VE BEEN AS I MENTIONED ADAM TO CHANGES TO OUR AT FAMILY FEE STRUCTURES. ON THE THIRD QUESTION ABOUT AS WE LOOK AT CROP BUT MANY OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO CRACK THE PROGRAM- WHATEVER OUR FUTURE PLANS PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSELY LOOKING AT- EACH OF THESE CHANGES THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE. A LOOK BACK I DIDN'T FIND WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO EVALUATE AND POTENTIALLY THINK ABOUT FURTHER EXTENDING- AND OF COURSE IN SOME CASES PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO CALIFORNIA'S BILLS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL APPROVAL. I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACROSS OUR STATE. I WE HAVE BEEN THE LEAD FOR PROJECT ROOM HE- ADDED IS A MULTI AGENCY EFFORT LED BY SOCIAL TO PROVIDE NON CONGREGATE SHELTERING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IT'S DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES REDUCE TRANSMISSION AND RELIEVE PRESSURE ON THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. I PROVIDING SAFE SHELTER FOR THOSE WHO ARE COPING POSITIVE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED ARE WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS IF THEY WERE TO BECOME INFECTED. AS YOU KNOW- LACKS IN MARCH MARCH EIGHTEENTH THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS EVAN INVESTMENT. A HUNDRED MILLION OF WHICH WOULD ADMINISTERED BY THE BUSINESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE HOUSING AGENCY. AT AND WHAT ALLOCATED DIRECTLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CONTINUUM OF CARE AND THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ACTIVE SOCIAL SERVICES SPECIFICALLY FOR PROJECT RANKING FOR USE BY COUNTY AND TRIED. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF A TRAILER COMPONENT AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. FOR ISOLATION. SUPPORT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FROM AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL TO. THAT AGAIN THE UP AND OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND BRINGS IN THAT SPACE IN ADDITION IT IS A PLACE WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DROP DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FINES. AND WERE ABLE TO SECURE APPROVAL FROM FEEDBACK. TO HAVE A 75% COST SHARE FOR THIS EFFORT. IN OUR OTHER HOMELESSNESS WITH THE THANK YOU HOUSING AT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER THEY BE FOR SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND CAL WORK OR REUNIFYING FAMILIES THAT CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ARE THOSE MAYBE WITH A DISABILITY OR SSI AT PROGRAM OR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAMS ARE OTHER PROGRAMS ACROSS THE BOARD WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE IS REALLY- EMPHASIZED- THE GUY THAT APPLICABILITY TO CLOCK THESE PROGRAMS- SO THAT COUNTIES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE REALLY LOOKING AT LEVERAGING AND BLENDING IN BRITAIN. BREAKING FLAT FIND AT TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF POPULATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD. THE NEXT QUESTION THANKS TO THE COUCH TIME CLOCKS I WANNA- OUTLINE THIS AGAIN TO CAO WORKS FORTY EIGHT MONTH TIME CLOCK WAS STOPPEDFOR THE MONTH OF MARCH APRIL MAY AND JUNE. ARE CLOCKED WITHOUT FOR THOSE WHO HAD REACHED FORTY EIGHT MONTHS OR HAD FEWER THAN FORTY EIGHT MONTH IN MARCH. THAT EXEMPTION COLD ALSO STOPPED THE WELFARE TO WORK TWENTY FOUR MONTH TIME CLOCK. THAT FEDERAL SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK WAS NOT STOPPED AS THERE'S BEEN NO ADDITIONAL FEC FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ON THE FEDERAL RULE. SO WE ARE IN THIS WITH. WOULD NOT KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY EXERCISES THERE'S BEEN FLEXIBILITY TO STATE FUNDED BENEFITS FOR SOME FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR AND FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK EXTENDER AND OF COURSE WE HAVE. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR OUR CHILD ONLY AT CASES. SHIFTING OVER TO OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM- WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN ALLOWING US TO PUT OUT IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I WE DID HAVE ALSO A PLACE WHERE THAT THAT AFTER WHICH FIRST AT CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ACT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND THAT IS- EIGHTY HOURS OF ADDITIONAL FRANKLY AT FOUR FOUR- ALL I JUST AS PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE AGAIN EXPANDED BACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS PROVIDING A AT WHAT AGE DIFFERENTIAL FOR THE BACKUP PROVIDERS. IT IS ALSO A IN PARTNERS NOT ONLY FOR AYE. BUT ALSO ALL FOR THE WHO ARE THE IN THE PROTECT SERVICES. WHERE WE PROVIDED OVER TIME FOR COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL THAT TOUCH POINT THE CONNECTION POINTS OF THE POPULATION. IT WILL BE JUST THE THING AGAIN WITH ANY ADDRESSING ANY I MET NEEDS- AND YET STILL DOING AN OVERALL WELL BEING CHECK. WE HAVE ALL THE DENTIST WINDING UP IN ROME PROCESS IS NOT. ABOUT THAT. OUTPUT ADDITIONAL LIKE. EAST WILL. ADD TO OCCUR REMOTELY. AS WELL. FOR INTO THE- WHO MAY BE RECEIVING THE FIVE THAT THE HE AGAIN I THE SOME OF THE EFFORT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FOR THE FAVORITE AT SET UP TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO MIGHT BE SOCIALLY ISOLATED- THEY NEED CONNECTION POINTS THAT YOU'LL HEAR BACK AT THE WELLNESS CHECK TO KEEP THAT THE FRIENDSHIP LINES AND OTHERS THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR. AT pAT A JUST A MOMENT. ALL THAT PROJECTED SERVICES MENTIONED IT THINGS HERE INCLUDING THE OUTRAGE. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUT REACH COUNCIL WORKER. WE'VE ALSO CREATED A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED LINE THAT HELPED FACILITATE THE CONNECTION FOR. MAY NOT KNOW WHICH THERE CAN CONTACTED- IN THAT FIRST WEEK OF STANDING UP THAT LINE YOU HAVE WELL OVER AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALLS. FOR WE HAVE SEEN- IN TERMS OF OUR EIGHT HERE AT NUMBERS TO BE SEEN AS THOSE ARE GO DOWN A BIT WE'RE CONTINUING TO COLLECT THAT MAKE THAT DATA AVAILABLE REAL TIME- THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IN PART DUE TO NOT HAVING CONTACTED MANDATED REPORTERS- ADHERE ABLE TO MODIFY STATE HOME WE WOULD EXPECT THOSE NUMBERS. ACTUALLY INCREASED- BUT AGAIN AT ALL ALL HANDS ON IN MAKING SURE WE'RE HAVING TOUCH POINTS- CONNECTION POINT AT TO OUR- TO OUR ELDERS ACROSS THE STATE. TURNING TO CHILD WELFARE THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONSFOR IT HERE- SIMILARLY AS I MENTIONED WITH APS ARE CALLED TO THE CHILD ABUSE HOTLINE ARE DOWN ALMOST THERE ARE LAST CHILD ABUSE REPORTS COMING IN EVEN DURING THE TIME OF WHAT WE KNOW- IS EXTREME STRESS ON FAMILIES. AGAIN A BIG PART OF THAT- IS DUE IN PART TO ADD TEACHERS EDUCATORS BEING AT A MANDATED REPORTER- AND ADD THAT THE DISTANCE LEARNING AND LACK OF IN PERSON ACCESS. TO CHILDREN IN THE IS A BIG PIECE OF THAT FOR THE DC LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A PRIMARY MANDATE REPORTER. I AN ID TO AT THIS POINT. BUT WITH ANOTHER. WHERE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL DID BEEN TOUCH POINTS TO FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS. EXPANSION OF HELP ONE BUT TWO ONE ONE PARENT THE NON MATH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR A FOSTER YOU PUT THE PROJECT AT THE LAPTOP CELL PHONES THE NEW HOT SPOT. ANOTHER PLACE WERE AT SOCIAL WORKERS WE'VE ASKED TO DO ADDITIONAL OUTREACH OPTION POPULATION AND HAVE- CREATED SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IS RELATED TO READ THE TERMINATION. THAT ALLOWED CASE WORKERS TO REALLY BE FOCUSING ON THE EMERGENCY WORK AT HAND. WE ARE PARTLY TWO HUNDRED ADULT A JOB THE FOSTER SYSTEM EVERY MONTH AND- TOO MANY OF THEM ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND STUDENTS IN SECURITY SAID DURING THE CRISIS. I WE HAVE EXTENDED THE- THEIR ABILITY TO REMAIN AT ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND THEIR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND PUT IT INTO PROVIDE. SECURITY WE'VE ALSO AT PROVIDED SOME FUNDING TO SUPPORT RESOURCE FAMILIES WHO ARE- SERVING SOMEOF THE YOUTH WITH THE HIGHER COMPLEX NEEDS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A HIGHER MONTHLY REIMBURSEMENT RATE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT- IT ALSO EXTENDED THE TIME FOR CARE GIVER APPROVAL. ACROSS THE BOARD. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED EARLY ON AND ARE GLAD TO SEE SOME CHANGE IN THE SPACE- BUT THE CHALLENGES WITH OUR COURT WE HAD- AT VARIANCE ACROSS THE STATE. IN TERMS OF MONTHLY VISITATION AT THAT WAS RESOLVED BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CHALLENGES IN TURN AS- THE COURT CAN REALLY BE ADD DELAYED FAMILY REUNIFICATION DELAYED OPTIONS AND GUARDIANSHIP. AS THERE HAS BEEN BEEN BACKLOGS CREATED SAID THAT SIR AND AT. THAT HUGE FOCUS OF OURS TO- CONTINUE TO LIFT UP WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO SEE S. SUPPORTED IN OUR COURT SYSTEM TO KEEP. AT THESE PROCEEDINGS MOVING IN ALSO ABOUT. TO KNOW IN THAT SPACE THAT I THAT THAT THE OF THE WOULD WORK PARTNERS WITH YOUR ACCOUNT AND WILL BE WITH THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL AS WELL. TWO MORE QUESTIONS HERE SO- HOW ARE RESPONDING TO THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY FOOD THE AND THAT AT GREAT QUESTION A LOT OF- EFFORTS IN THE FRONT IN THE SPECIALLY. FEDERALLY AT BOTH AT PROVED WAIVERS BUT OFTEN YOU RESOURCES HERE SO. EMERGENCY CALTRANS ALLOTMENTS THAT ALLOWS. FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH APRIL AND MAY CALPERS RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT UP TO THEIR MAXIMUM- ON APRIL TWELFTH OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVED A TOTAL OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WITH AN AVERAGE INCREASE THAT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD- THESE AGAIN WE HAVE APPROVED MARCH APRIL AND MAY AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTED ADDS THAT- WE WILL CONTINUE ISSUING EMERGENCY ALLOTMENT INTEL CALIFORNIA'S. AT STATE OF EMERGENCY IF LEFT AT THAT THE HUGE- SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES THAT WE FOR DIRECTLY. FROM THEM MAKE THE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE ALSO. A LARGE DARK. HE BEAT SHE AND THIS IS WHY. OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE EL FOR EVERY PRICE MEALS CAN GET UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL- PANDEMIC EBT FOOD BENEFITS. ARE THOSE ABSTAINED LEGAL CHILDREN WHO ARE ALREADY RECEDING HEALTH FRESH MEDI CAL OR FOSTER CARE BENEFITS DO NOT NEED TO APPLY THAT'S GOING TO BE AN AUTOMATIC ISSUANCE AT THEIR PANDEMIC EBT CARD IN THE MAIL. AT LATER THIS MONTH. I AND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS BUT AS- I MAYBE REN'T ON OUR CALPERS PROGRAM WILL NEED TO APPLY THEY HAVE THAT APPLICATION PERIOD THROUGH THE END OF JUNE. WITH THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT WILL ISSUE UP TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS TO APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE SCHOOL CLOSURES OVER THE MONTH OF MARCH TO JUNE. IN ADDITION- WE HAVE PROVIDED AS SUPPLEMENTAL STATE FUNDED FOOD BOXES IN IT AT- TWENTY POUNDS- THAT SHELF STABLE FOOD IS ENOUGH TO FEED THE FAMILY OF THREE TO FOUR THOSE BOTH BOXES OF FOOD- HAVE GONE OUT TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES STATEWIDE THAT'S WITH A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. ABOUT YOU SUPPORTED US WITH THE BACKSPACE DO NOT SUPPORTING OVER FIFTY FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE ANTICIPATING ADDITIONAL AT FUNDS COMING FOR FOOD BANKS IN JULY NOT ONLY FOR. ADDITIONAL FOOD TO BE DELIVERED TO THE EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL VOLUNTEERS NATIONAL GUARD AND OTHERS TO. HELP ACTUALLY COME HAVE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS AND COULD ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE BOXES THE SORT THAT HE- THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS THE CRAFT WITH THE BANK STATEWIDE. BEFORE THIS IS BEFORE AND THEY MAKE IT TO THE TO THE BUSINESS PROGRAM THIRD OVER ONE POINT SEVEN GET BILLION PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. CONTINUING TO COLLECT THE PAY ON JUST HOW. MANY MORE- INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACT HE- CERTAINLY HEARING A LOT ABOUT THAT ACROSS. THE STATE AT THE CONTINUED NEED. SOCIAL SERVICES MANY BUT- SETTLEMENT FOOD PROGRAM FOR. OLDER ADULTS AGE SIX AND OVER WITH THE BOX WITH EACH THE AND THAT WORK AT COULD BE FAN CAL. THIS PROGRAM THIRDS WANT THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS EACH MONTH. I AM AT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH A US BE A AND PARTNER FEEDBACK WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO RELAX A BIT OF THESE WILL THAT WILL. ADD TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE TWO BANKS TO GET THE FOOD OUT TO THOSE OLDER ADULTS EACH MONTH. AND FINALLY ON THE PARTS WE HAVE RECEIVED YOU SCA APPROVAL TO REPEAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED FARM TO FOOD BANKS PROGRAM. I WILL TO THE OPERATING AT MUCH THE SAME S THE FOOD BANKS AND AS CDS BASIC THIS BILL PART OF FAMILY PRODUCE SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT THAT. WE'RE NOT WASTING ANY OF THE FOOD AND WERE ABLE TO CONNECT. THE FAMILY TO A NEED IF SUPPORT WITH THE FRESH PRETTY COULD PRODUCE- THAT THE FARMERS HAVE BEEN CREATING WERE PAYING THE PAST PICKING PACKING SHIPPING COSTS A GOOD GUY BRING THAT THAT PRODUCE. FROM. THE FIELD TO HOMES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN. QUESTION RELATED TO LET. BLUR ACT FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE DURING THE LAST RECESSION. A VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET AND POLICY DECISIONS WERE MADE REFLECTING ON THIS AND WHAT. WHAT MAY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IMPORTANT. WHERE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE REDUCTION OF THAT IMPACT THE LEAST NUMBER OF THE MOST VULNERABLE ABOUT PROGRAMS- WE ALSO WANT TO BE COGNIZANT OF HOW ONE'S PROGRAMS REDUCTION INTERPLAY'S WITH. OTHER PROGRAMS SO REALLY LOOKING AT- THE INDIVIDUALS ACROSS OUR STATE WHO MAY BE AT BENEFICIARIES OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS AND HOW- ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES. WHAT IMPACT THEM ON MULTIPLE LEVELS. WORKS AS YOU HEARD ME SAY THEIR- IT'S TIME QUE CONTINUE TO MAXIMIZE ALL OF THE FEDERAL RESOURCES- BAD ENOUGH I ANY SPECIAL BY THE OPPORTUNITIES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS WE CAN LEVERAGE UP PROGRAM DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. AND ULTIMATELY SAVING MONEY WITH IMPACT IMPACTING THE FEWEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ALONG THE WAY. SO I WILL STOP WITH THOSE REMARKS AND AT BE AVAILABLE HERE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND NEXT WE HAVE DIRECTOR PARCHMAN. THE DOCTOR REGULAR AND MEMBERS- HAPPY TO BE HERE DANCE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR IDEA- IF YOU TO FOCUS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE IN THE AGENDA- I WILL- PROVIDE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAKING THAT AND THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN RESPONSE TO COLD AT NINETEEN- WHEN WE FIRST. STARTED HE BEING OUR OUR ROAD MAP FOR HOW TO BE RESPONSIVE DURING THIS CRISIS IT BECAME REALLY APPARENT THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO FOCUS ON A NUMBER OF EALLY KIND OF KEY AND RITICAL AREAS. THE FIRST OF WHAT YOU THINK THE AND THEN AND MINIMIZING THE RISK AND EXPOSURE TO- OUR POPULATION WHICH- IS FREQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND CERTAINLY WANTED TO BE- MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD TO BE RESPONSIVE TO- ENSURING THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THE OTHER AREA WITH FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO REGIONAL CENTERS BECAUSE WE REALLY NEEDED TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE COULD GET SERVICES- TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE- IN A WAY THAT IS DIFFERENT- BUT ALL OF THE RESPONSES AND BEING- AWARE OF THE MOST. URGENT AND IMMEDIATE NEEDS. ALSO A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH SERVICE ALTERNATIVE. AND IT'S BORING OR THEIR WAYS SO CERTAINLY MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL FUNDING LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT WE COULD HAVE THOSE ALTERNATIVES WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES. WE HAVE A REMARKABLE COMMUNITY THAT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT- TO OUR CONSUMERS- IN WAYS THAT- WE CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND RECENTLY THAT ARE VERY CREATIVE. AND VERY NIMBLE AND RESPONSE THE- BUT ALSO ONGOING EVALUATION OF THE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING IN OUR RESPONSE TO- THE CRISIS AND THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT WORKING AND THINGS WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST. AND HEAD THAT AND MAYBE TAKE A LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES- LASTLY WE REALLY WANTED TO BE VERY FOCUSED ON COMMUNICATION NOT ONLY COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT THE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THE DEPARTMENT. WORKS OUT THE BALL TO THE REGIONAL CENTER THE FAMILIES TO PROVIDERS TO ADVOCATE- BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE WORKING KIDDING ABOUT THAT. TO GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL. AROUND THE EXTRA. SO AND IN TAKING A LOOK AT SAFETY WE WERE THE- A I SAID WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN. THAT RISK ANDEXPOSURE TO THE INDIVIDUAL THE FAMILY THREE DON'T CENTER STAFF AND ALSO TO PROVIDERS- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WAS TO MINIMIZE. ANY EXPOSURE IN CONGREGATE SETTING AND SO HAVING THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO RESTRICT- ADMISSION AND- GETS CHARGES FROM CERTAIN STUDYING SO WE CAN REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE- TAPE THAT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STABILIZE. AND NOT PROVIDE THAT EXPOSURE TO A VULNERABLE POPULATION. THAT BAD WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT- CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THEM AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. WE DON'T CENTERS WORKING VERY VERY HARD AND IDENTIFYING CAPACITY THAT THEY COULD DEVELOP IS WHAT WE CALL FOR STORAGE CAPACITY. WHICH ARE WE'RE GOING TO BE ALTERNATE THAT FIGHT. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO EITHER WERE COLD AND POSITIVE OR EXPOSED OR EVEN WITHOUT A DETERMINED- EXPOSURE WHERE CAN WE SAFELY SUPPORT THEM. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WAS REALLY CRITICAL WE HAD A REALLY REMARKABLE- CLINICAL TEAM AT THE DEPARTMENT REGIONAL CENTERS DEPLOYED- THEIR CLINICAL TEAM WE ACCESS THE REMARKABLE TEAM THROUGH- PT PH AND THE AT THAT. THAT ALSO PROVIDED SUPPORT TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE PROVIDING THE BEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP FOLKS. THINK THROUGH WHAT ARE THE BEST- STRATEGY THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH GUIDING. THE DAY HOW DO YOU ISOLATE HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MINIMIZING THEM WRAPPED. BOTH SOME OF THE EXAMPLES WHAT WE HAD PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO OUR PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY THOSE- IN A HIGH RISK AREA- OUR ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR PERSONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS. WE KNOW THAT WE HAD INDIVIDUALS. WITH MOST. BIG AND COME. THREE DIED THE NAME. BUT ALSO ARE I OF PDF AND BEING. SO WHAT WE DID VERY ON IS THAT WE ON STOPPED ALL. VISITORS GOING INTO THOSE HOMES AND WE STOPPED ALL PLACEMENT GOING AND WITHOUT- OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT- WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT WITH A STRATEGY THAT THE PROVIDER WAS ABLE TO DO TO. MINIMIZE THE REST THROUGH ISOLATION WE RECOGNIZE THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES AND FOR INDIVIDUALS AND NOT HAVE THOSE THAT THAT. I OTHER PANELISTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH OF EVERYBODY BUT AGAIN I DO I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREDIBLE CREATIVE APPROACHES. THAT ARE PROVIDERS HAVE REALLY TAKE AND MAKING SURE THAT EVEN IN THAT THEY'D BE CLOSE REMARKABLE CHALLENGING TIME. THAT THEY REALLY DID OPEN UP THEIR MINDS AND STAND HOW THEY CAN HAVE THAT THAT THROUGH VIRTUAL VISIT. X. BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REMAIN CONNECTED- ALBEIT NOT IN THE SAME TRADITIONAL WAYS IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT THEY REALLY DID I MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE MAKING. THE BEST OF WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE ALSO. TOOK A LOOK AT HOW WE COULD- PROVIDE CONTINUE OVERSIGHTAND MONITORING- WHEN THAT SITE VISITS WERE NOT ABLE TO BE DONE WE ALSO- DID THE SAME AS OTHERS HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE USING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE VIDEO. VISITING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE DOING A REVIEW THAT WE NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO DO IN ON THE DIFFERENT- RESIDENTIAL SETTING- DARK CHRISTIAN BY YEAH OTHER SETTINGS AND HAVE BE ABLE TO PORT PROBLEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE. A PROVIDING THE SUPPORT TO THE PROVIDERS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE MONITORING. ON THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE DELIVERED- WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN WORK WITH THE STATE LOCAL- RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE THOSE REPORT THIS TO THE RESULT CENTER TO INCLUDE- P. P. AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE PROVIDING THE- THE NETWORKING THAT WAS AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT AREA COMMUNITIES. BUT THE ABILITY WAS- FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD DIRECTED THEM RESOURCES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WITH TO MAKE SURE THAT I DELEGATED MY AUTHORITY- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS. ONTO THE LOCAL LEVEL SO FOR PARTICULAR SERVICES- THAT DELEGATION WENT TO THE RESULT CENTERS SO THEY CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO THE RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS. AND OF THE PORT SERVICES THAT WERE ESSENTIAL TO GET IN- IN A TIMELY WAY- WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TELE SERVICE- PARTICULARLY WITH THE NON RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS WHO WHO FOUNDED IMPORTANCE. ON TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE CONNECTIONS WITH THE PORT. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD GET THOSE SERVICES INTO THE HOME WITH THE- FOR THE INDIVIDUALS LIVE. WHETHER IT WAS LIKE A FAMILY OR. AND THE RESIDENTIAL CUTTING. WE A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNE. TO MAXIMIZE THAT THE WHAT BUT EARLY. SERVICES NOT ONLY WITH THE EARLY START SERVICE COORDINATORS FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER- BUT ALSO OUR EARLY START SERVICE PROVIDERS QUICKLY ADAPTED AND WENT TO AND TELL A THERMOS OPTION. WE ALSO RECEIVED WHILE IT WAS CHALLENGING FOR SOME FAMILIES THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS ACT THAT'S BEING THE- ACTUAL EQUIPMENT RESOURCES. THAT WE REALLY DID HERE- THAT THAT FAMILIES AND- THE EARLY START SERVICE PROVIDERS FOUND THAT TO BE. A REALLY GREAT ALTERNATIVE- AND IT ALLOWED THE FLEXIBILITY NOT ONLY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THAT SERVICE. BUT ALSO AND- ALTERNATIVE TIME FRAME WHETHER IT WAS ON THE WEEKEND OR EVENING. ON BECAUSE THE FAMILIES WERE TAKEN FROM- VERY CHALLENGING TIME AND IN THEIR SCHEDULES. AS THEY WERE ADAPTING TO- NEW NEW WAYS OF HAVING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY- WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT HOW WE COULD YOU REMOTE AND TAKING PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR. ANY NEW CASES COMING INTO THE RESULT. THAT OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN IMPORTANT. WHILE WE RECOGNIZE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO ON SITE- ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT- WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT AND PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO HAVE INSURANCE. THAT WE WERE NOT ELAINE- SERVICES TO THOSE NOT NOT ONLY CURRENTLY IN- THE RESULT CENTER- SYSTEM BUT THOSE THAT WERE JUST ENTERING INTO IT- WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT THOSE IMPACT TO SERVICE PROVIDERS EARLY ON WE HAD HEARD. FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT- THE DEADLINE OF GETTING SELF ASSESSMENT FOR REQUIREMENTS AT THE AGE TO BE A COMPLIANCE. TAKING A LOOK AT. AND BEING FOCUSED ON AND THEY COULD FOCUS ON THE ON THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS AT HAND- LOOKING AT COMMUNICATION THIS WAS ALSO AN AREA. THAT WAS REALLY CRITICAL WE IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT TO OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS- TALK TO THE CONSUMER ADVISORY COMMITTEE TALKED A FAMILY GROUP. WORKED WITH- MANY OF OUR MEMBERS WITHIN OUR JOB- BELT MENTAL SERVICE THE TASK FORCE WORKGROUP. AN AREA THAT WAS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL WITH OUR OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO WERE ON THE FRONT LINES THE WORKING OUR WITH OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO HEAR WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES WERE. ON TO SEE HOW WE COULD HELP CONNECT THEM TO THOSE IMMEDIATE MAIN. AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIALOGUE IN THAT PARTNERSHIP AND LISTENING TO WHAT THE NEEDS WORK. WE HAVE ALL BEEN OUR WEBSITE AND THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE- FOR THOSE TWO ACT THAT WHEN I JUST KINDA WANT WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES.

ON ENSURING THAT OUR DIRECTIVES WERE- TRANSLATED INTO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WHERE WE COULD AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS IT AT TO PLAIN LANGUAGE. WE WERE VERY VERY APPRECIATIVE OF OUR PARTNERS IN WORKING WITH US ON THE PLAIN LANGUAGE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ALSO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ARE DIRECTORS WERE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY IN VARIOUS. THAT. WE STARTED A I KNEW I. WHERE WE YOU CAN AN AUDIO VERSION.

AND SO ALL OF THE- ARE. ON OUR WEBSITE WE CONTINUE TO UPDATE ON A DISPLAY MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE RESPONSIVE TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME IN THROUGH A DEDICATED EMAIL LINE. THAT THE- FAQS WERE UP ON OUR WEBSITE WE CONTINUE TO UPDATE THOSE A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK- THE OTHER KEY STRATEGIES THAT WE RELATE ON HAD TO FOCUS ON IN AND DELIVERY OF CRITICAL STRUCTURE- AND RESPONSE WAS WITHIN HEADQUARTERS WE CREATED A CO GOOD RESPONSE TEAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE REAL CRITICAL AREAS THAT. WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY EVERYTHING FROM- DOING ASSESSMENT OF OUR- CONSUMERS WHO HAD- HAD JOBS PRIOR TO CO GOOD NINETEEN. AND TO AT THAT IF ANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IF THEY BALK THEIR JOB- WORKING WITH THE PROVIDERS AND THE INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ACCESSING THOSE RESOURCES TO UNEMPLOYMENT THE OTHER RESOURCES. THAT THEY COULD- TAPPED INTO THAT IT'S BEEN- PUT. FORWARD BY THE STATE. I JUST THAN WORKING. SUPPORTED AND PROVIDERS FOR FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY CAN ALSO FOR THIRD. THROUGH SOME VIDEO SERVICES AND ALTER. REPORT WE ALL HAD A TEAM LED THE THIRDS DEVELOPMENT WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. JUST OVER TWELVE HUNDRED CAPACITY FOR THIRDS DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. REGIONAL CENTER DID THAT THROUGH- LIKE THE- STUDYING- WE APPRECIATED OUR OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND HELPING US IN EXPEDITING ANY OF THE LICENSES THAT WE NEEDED TO DO. DAY PROGRAM STEPPED UP IN IDENTIFYING RESOURCES THAT THEY COULD USE. UNTIL WE CAN ESTABLISH THEM THIRDS DEVELOPMENT ALSO LOOKING AT HOTELS MOTELS. I'M LOOKING AT SECURING APARTMENT SO WE CAN PROVIDE DOES ALTERNATIVE ISOLATION FIGHT SHOULD THAT NEED TO BE THERE- WE ALSO WORK WITH DEVELOPING FAIRVIEW IMPORTER BILL AS THIRDS LOCATION- WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- CLOTHES. AND BE POPULATE THE GENERAL TREATMENT AREAS. BUT WE'RE ALSO REALLY PLEASED THAT WE HAD THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US. TO ESTABLISH JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED- SAID THAT COULD BE ACT THAT RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT. SHOULD WE NEED IT WE ALSO MET WITH RESULT IN A DIRECTORS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND CONTINUE TO DO SO TO HEAR WHAT THEY'RE- ON COMMUNITIES ARE ARE TAKING AS PART CHALLENGES- REGIONAL CENTER AND HAVING THE- ASSURANCE THAT THEY WERE ALSO DOING PROACTIVE OUTREACH- THEY WERE. WERE HAVING TO BE NIMBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS WERE DOING A TELE SERVICE AND I'M REACHING OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITY- I'M REALLY REALLY PLEASED WITH THE WORK AT THAT SERVICE COORDINATOR CAN OUT HAD DONE IN MAKING SURE THAT. OUT WHICH WAS DONE ON A PROACTIVE WE RECOGNIZE AND BIRDS FROM FROM FAMILIES THAT THEY'VE HAD CHALLENGES IN GETTING THOSE- CALL BACK WHEN THEY PULLED THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGE THAT CHANGING PHONE SYSTEMS. AND MAKING SURE THAT. THAT I THAT THE THERE WE DO ON SENDS OUT ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO HAVE THE RESULT. WHERE BACK TO US IS TO THEIR MITIGATING THAT REP WHEN. ARE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS OUR SERVICE COORDINATOR. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROS BETTER NAY TO A THAT. THAT PEOPLE IN NEED YOU KNOW HOW DO WE A FELLOW THAT THAT AT THAT YOU KNOW AS I SHARED WITH ON OF THE DIRECTOR. BY THE BILL THAT IS REALLY. CERTAINLY AGAIN WITH THE- WITH OUR STATE GROUPS AND I. THOSE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CAN TO. BUILD ON OUR OUR OUR BUILDING BLOCKS WE STARTED USE- ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE MONITOR AND FOLLOW UP ON COMPLAIN- SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO MONITOR ANY COMPLAINT THAT COME TO THE DEPARTMENT SO WE CAN BE RESPONSE THAT AND HELP- NAVIGATE. THOSE ISSUED TO A PROBLEM RESOLUTION AND- IN ADDITION WE PROVIDED- ALTERED SAYS A WAIVER REQUIREMENT- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS FEDERAL- FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE WAIVER REQUIREMENT WHICH HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL NOT FLEXIBILITY AS AN IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES. I HAD SHARED WITH YOU IT AS FAR THE INTAKE SERVICE AN ELIGIBILITY FOR NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES WE HAVE A PROVISION IN OUR REGULATIONS THAT ALLOWS FOR RETAIN OURPAYMENT- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE- SERVICE PROVIDERS- AND CONTINUE GUYTON FOR COMING OUT. TO HOW TO HELP THEM- IDENTIFIED THEIR THEIR- ONGOING- MONITORING OF THEIR DOCUMENTATION TO BE ABLE TO CLAIM- FOR THOSE NON RESIDENTS ARE THOSE- A RETAINER PAYMENTS FOR NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES- WE ADDED ONE OF THE AREAS THAT HAS HELPED A NUMBER F FAMILIES IS THE ADDITIONAL. FLEXIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE AND DIRECTED SERVICE SAYS- ALREADY DEAD FAMILIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS IT FOR RESPITE SERVICES WE EXTENDED IT THE PERSONAL ASSISTANT INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS. AND THAT'S BAD I HAD SHARED WITH SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT- HAS ALSO BEEN pDIRECTED CERVANTES. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THAT WERE. WERE HEARING FAN AND REYES OFTEN ALL ALL SOME OF THOSE WE YOU AND WE CAN. TO AND- WITH THEM TO WE WERE. THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH STRATEGIES. AND IDENTIFY AFFECTED MEAN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME. OR ALL OF THESE ISSUES- FAMILIES AND REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE SHARED I'M OUT CONCERNS AS FAR AS- FOOD AND SECURITY SOME OF THE BASIC NEEDS AND SO THAT'S WHERE IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER TO SEE IF THOSE RESOURCES CAN HELP CONNECT TO- THAT STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES FOR FOOD ACCESS- ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR DAY PROGRAM PROVIDERS AND OTHER NON RESIDENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO. USE THEIR SERVICES- AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO CONNECT THEM TO PICKING UP FOOD DELIVERING FOOD CHECKING ON FAMILIES- AND CONTINUING THAT FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE HAVING ACCESS TO THOSE BASIC NEEDS. TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN AN AREA OF A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF OUR FAMILY- IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD THE TECHNOLOGY RESULT THAT ARE TO THEM WORKING WITH THEM TO SECURE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO TECHNOLOGY. BEING ABLE TO BE HOW THEY CAN LOAN AND GET RESOURCES FOR- IPAD. AND THEN LOOKING IN EXPLORING HOW TO ACCESS- WIFI TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FAMILIES CAN ACCESS BOTH ALTERNATIVE- VIRTUAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THAT WE ALLOWED THROUGH THE FLEXIBILITY THERE'S BEEN AND- CONTINUED. FOR BROADER AND- IN PLAIN LANGUAGE WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR FAMILY. AND HOME SERVICES DURING SCHOOL CLOSURES- RESULT THAT ARE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE AND LOOKING AT HOW TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESPITE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICES. AND AGAIN THE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICE. IT'S REALLY AT A KEY AREA OF FAMILY THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS. HAVING SOMEBODY COME INTO THEIR HOME THAT THEY COULD DO DOWN MEMBER AND THOSE ARE CLOSE TO THEM. TO PROVIDE TEMPORE THAT THEY NOT A BEEN ABLE TO. ACCESS PRIOR TO COPE NIGHT. AT FIFTY RESULT ENTERED AND CERTAINLY UNSERVED PROVIDER THE CONCERN IS AS FAR AS ACCESSING ON I THINK WE- TO AND THAT'S- WELL WE STILL HERE CONCERN. ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEND OUT PP THROUGH THAT STATE THAT THE- THAT HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO REYES CENTERS AND WE CONTINUE TO- FOCUS ON THIS AREA. MANY PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR THEIR OWN THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS- BUT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND EXPLORE HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH- WHEN WE LOOK AT. WHAT IT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO MOVING FORWARD RIGHT NOW WITH THE- RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC- AND LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- BEAT EFFORTS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO- MAKE SURE THAT WERE. NOT A TRAINED THE HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS- WE ARE YOU SEEN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTING TO BE ABLE TO TRACK TRENDS AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW- ANY COMPLAINTS ARE TRENDING AS WELL AS- INCIDENT REPORT. TO SEE A FOURTEEN BY THE DIFFERENT AREAS. THAT WE CAN BE RESPONSE TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE INCIDENT AND MONITORING THOSE THEN IF WE NEED TO- GO. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE WILL NEED TO DO THAT. LOOKING AT WE HAVE TO CAN TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE AND ALTER A BUT ALSO CAN OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY SO WE CAN LISTEN TO THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. ON AND SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES- THAT WE CAN DO PARTICULARLY FOR OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STAYING CONNECTED TO HEAR HOW THEY'RE ACCESSING SERVICES OR WHETHER OR NOT UNABLE TO ACT THAT THAT WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE- SO I. WANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAIVER AMENDMENT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO DRAW ON FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND THE FLEXIBILITY AND TO THE SERVICE DELIVERY DURING THE TIME THAT IT CONTINUING TO BE AN AREA THAT WE- WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. THOUGH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BARGE MAN AND NEXT WE HAVE DIRECTOR MCCOY WEIGHED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS CHEMICALLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A DIALOGUE WITH YOU- IN THE PUBLIC THIS AFTERNOON I APPRECIATED SPECIALLY THE WAY YOU HAVE FRAMED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. THREE THINGS THE CO THE NINETEEN CRISIS THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS AND THE CHALLENGES IN THE HEAD I DON'T THINK THE BOOK ALL THREE OF THOSE THAT. PHONE TWO OF THE HEALTH CRISIS FOR OLDER. WHO WE SERVE AHEAD OF HER OF THE- THIS WITHOUT THEY ARE THE MOST AT RISK IN SO MANY. FOR OF WE KNOW FROM FIFTH BEING THE FIRST TO ASK THE STATE. OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS AGING AND OTHER UNDER CRIME CONDITION OF THEIR- WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS YOU AGE THE QUEUE MOTHER EFFECT WITH. AND HOW. IN MOUNTAIN AND WE'RE SEEING TO IN THE KEY. AND THIRDLY WE KNOW THAT CAMINO. COVER GETS. UP SPECIAL RED OF A IN MAKE FACT BECAUSE VERY CHEN. AND OLDER. ARE LIVING THOSE BETTER. BECAUSE OF THOSE DIFFERENT RISK- WE ARE SEEING DEATHS IN OUR STATE OUR OF OUR FAMILY AND OUR FRIENDS AND OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE. THE LATEST DATA IS IN THE HIGH SEVENTIES EIGHTY PERCENT- AND OF COURSE TAKE THE FLUID IN FLUCTUATING BUT- IT'S CLEAR THAT OLDER ADULTS. ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE FROM THE HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. ECONOMICALLY THERE ALSO CURIOUS ISSUES FOR OVER CALIFORNIANS OUT- OLDER CALIFORNIA'S OVER FIFTY FIVE. OR ABOUT ABOUT A DOMINATED EDUCATION AND HEALTH AS WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY. BUSINESS MANAGEMENT- AND ARE STAYING HOME FROM WORK. A LIVING WORK ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT I CAN AND THAT WILL. IN BOTH THEIR SHORT TERM NEED TERM LONG TERM RETIRE PROF. BECAUSE OF. CONCERNS FOR OLDER HEALTH FOR IN OUR WE WERE TO. AND COURSE THE- LET A MOST OLDER ADULTS ARE LIVE IN PART FAMILY WORKING. AND AT THE- CAN BE. AND SO THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC IMPACT MULTI GENERATIONAL. ON OLDER ADULTS WHO MAY NEED MORE CARE DIFFERENT HAIR CHANGING HERE. ARE REALLY OF THE WHOLE FAMILY WHOLE COMMUNITY IMPACT. AND THEN THIRDLY THE CHALLENGES AND NEEDS. ARE THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THAT THEIR WORK CHALLENGES THE NEEDS AND THE AGING. SYSTEM AND SERVICES IN OUR STATE I AM CALLING FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING LAST YEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND IT'S AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOU ALL. AND STAKEHOLDERS AND THE CABINET WORK GROUP AND THE PUBLIC TO REALLY LISTEN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. FACING OUR SYSTEM- OUR STATE AS WE WANT TO BE THE BEST STATE THE GOLDEN STATE FOR THE GOLDEN YEARS. BUT WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES THE NEEDS AND THIS CRISIS REALLY HAVE. THROWN THOSE THOSE ARE CHALLENGES INTO SHARP RELIEF- WHERE WE ARE STRONG WE HAVE EXCELLED IN WHERE WE HAVE GAP WE HAVE HAD TO REALLY- DOUBLE DOWN- TO ADDRESS THAT AND SO I WILL GO GO TO THAT A MORE SPECIFIC. BUT REALLY THE STATE HAD BEEN SET BY THE PRIORITY- AND BEGINNING TO EMERGE IN THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS. ARE THE PRIORITY THAT WE ARE FOCUSING. ON IN OUR RESPONSE. IN TERMS OF THAT APART RAPIDLY. TO A I WOULD POINT YOU TO WALK THROUGH OUR STRAT. BUT THEY ALSO. IN OUR OF SPECIAL OF NEW THAT WE RELEASED ON FRIDAY. MATTERS IN THEIR NEWSLETTER. AND YOU CAN FIND IT ON OUR WEBSITE AGING DOT CA DOT GOV LONG WITH OTHER. HELPFUL INFORMATION WE THANK OUR FOR. OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE DISABILITY FAMILY AND FRIENDS RESPONDING TO THE CODE RED. OF CRISIS BUT THERE ARE FOUR STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON FIRST AND FOREMOST SERVING PEOPLE REDESIGNING OUR SERVICE IS EXPANDING OUR SERVICES TO MEET THE MOMENT. OUR LARGEST PROGRAMS ARE OLDER CALIFORNIANS NUTRITION PROGRAM. ARE THEY HAVE BEEN BOTH HOME DELIVERED MEALS. AS WELL AS COMMUNITY DELIVERED MAIL THE COMMUNITY CENTERS OF COURSE THOSE CENTERS ARE CLOSED. AND HAVE THE MEAL WHO VOTED TO DELIVERY SO NOW ALL OF OUR DEAL PRO. ARE TO. OF THE LAST WEEK WE HAVE DATA FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS WERE SERVED IN MID APRIL. OF AVERAGE THAT WE ARE SERVING MORE PEOPLE MORE FOOD. FINDING NEW VOLUNTEERS ARE USING OTHER WORKFORCE. OF OUR NETWORK OF- COUNTY. AND NONPROFIT. AGENCIES ON A HAVING RISEN TO THAT. AND COLLABORATIVE WAYS MOVED MORE FOOD MARK AND IF THEY WAY. OF COURSE WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THE- WITH YOU JUST. CRITICAL NEED COMPORT HEALTH PROGRAM FOLDER. AND PEOPLE DISABILITY AS WELL AS THE GOOD BANG PROGRAM. AND THE NEW PARTNER OF THE PARTNER COMING OUT OF THE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH OUR AGENCY AROUND GREAT PLATE. AND WORKING AT THE PORT BOW RESTAURANT AND ADULTS AT HOME. A AREA OF OUR PRO. IS WE PROVIDE OUR HEALTHCARE AND HEALTH SERVICES. BUT LET'S OLDER ADULTS A STADIUM HOMES OF THEIR CHOICE. TO THE ONES THAT ARE THE LARGEST OUR- BE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES ARE FORMALLY KNOWN AS ADULT DAY HEALTHCARE- THOSE PROGRAMS ARE NOW BEING CERTAIN YOUR SERVICES BEYOND THE WALLS. ARE VISIT CONSERVATIVE THAT USED TO BE IN PERSON AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER ARE NOW OVER THE PHONE ARE NOW- DRIVE BY WHICH THEY DID SOMETHING REALLY HAD TO REINVENT WHAT A COMMUNITY CENTER MODEL LOKS LIKE WHEN WE ARE NOW ALL STAYING AT HOME. THE OUR MULTI SERVICE FINGERS. LIKE PERFECT GIVE ME HOPE PURPOSE YOUR SERVICE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDE BOTH SOCIAL AND HEALTH. SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE OUR MOST FRAIL. OLDER OF FOLKS LIVING AT HOME ON THEIR OWN WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NEED TO BE IN A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY HAVE DOUBLE DOWN TO ON THEIR TELEPHONE CONTACT TELEPHONE SUPPORT CARE COORDINATION WRAPAROUND- MAKING SURE IT'S EVERYTHING IS CHANGING AROUND THAT. BUT THEIR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SUPPORT A REMAIN STRONG. ALTHOUGH THOSE PROGRAMS AGAIN COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES AND MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES ARE REINVENTING REDESIGNING TO KEEP SERVING FOLKS. A THIRD MAJOR CLUB AREA US INFORMATION THAT THE BOYS NEW PUT INFORMATION IS HI. I KNOW WE WANTED BE PART OF WITH OF COURSE NEW CODE LINE TELEPHONE LINE AND THE NIGHT WEBPAGE. BUT THE MINISTRY SET UP. BUT WE BOTH AGREE OUR ADULT INFO LINE THAT CAN YOU TO YOUR LOCAL AGENTS ARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE ACT AND QUICK ROUTING FOLKS NEED AND WE PUT RESOURCES OUT OF A RANGE NUMBERS. A PROTECT SERVICES WITH OUR CALL AT THE THAT. ALZHEIMER'S HOTLINE FRAUD HOTLINE A ARE P. PUT THAT OUT INFORMING DIFFERENT. RECKON THAT THE- OF OUR STATE WE HAVE NEWSPAPER AL RUNNING A L. G. B. Q. WE HAVE RADIO ADS RUNNING IN SEVEN. EIGHT L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G. WE HAVE&lt;/c&gt; HOPE GOING OUT PARTICULARLY TARGETING PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY. A RATE RADIO PRINT DIGITAL AS WELL. ARE GETTING YOUNGER OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE ONLINE- SO REALLY TRYING TO REACH ALL CORNERS OF OUR STATE- COMMUNITIES OF OUR STATE AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. A FOURTH PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN IS STAYING AT HOME. IN GETTING LONELY. THIS INTERFERING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR ALL OF US. NOW WE IMMEDIATELY- WERE ABLE TO STAND UP WITH SUPPORT OF OUR LOCAL AREA. AGING AGENCIES THE FRIENDSHIP LINE THAT. A NATIONAL TREASURE THAT EXIST IN THE BAY AREA FOR YEARS WE WERE ABLE TO EXPANDED STATEWIDE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ONE ONE NINE. FOR ANY OLDER ADULTS WHO JUST WANT SOMEONE TO TALK TO. AT ANYTIME PERSONAL DISABILITY A CARE GIVER THE FRIENDLY LINE THERE FOR YOU AND ABLE TO DEAL WITH A CRISIS AS WELL. WE'VE ALSO THIRTY CONFERENCE CALL CHECK THEM WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO SUPPORT ALL THE CARE GIVING HAPPENING THIS WEEK WILL BE ON SELF CARE I COMMEND YOU TO ADD N WEDNESDAY IF YOU CAN'T. AND WE'RE TAKING A LOOK ALSO DIGITAL DIVIDE AD SOME OF THE CONVERSATION HERE ABOUT TELEHEALTH AND OTHER- CRITICAL CONNECTION VIDEO CHATTING WITH YOUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL YOU NEED TO HAVE. A BE ONLINE AND HAVE ACCESS AND HAVE TOOLS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE ACCEPTABLE. WE HEARD THE SAN DIEGO GROUPS ON THE WEB IN OUR LAST WEEK IN WITH HEARING CONTEMPLATIVE COULD GROUPS. ARE NEXT WEEK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR OLDER ADULTS THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO DO IN THAT AREA. AND THE FIFTH PROGRAM AREA THAT WE'VE WORKED ON. OF COURSE IS THE RESIDENTIAL. ARE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL RIGHT OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITY YOUR LONG TERM CARE ON BIRDS PROGRAM. WE HAVE A FAQ AND OTHER RESOURCES TO HELP FAMILIES. WHO REALLY TRYING TO NAVIGATE VERY CHALLENGING TIME. GIVEN GIVEN THE INABILITY TO VISIT. GIVEN THE RISK OF INFECTION GIVEN THE- ALARMING NEWS NATIONALLY AND ABOUT SOME RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE. FOR THOSE THAT ARE FIVE PROGRAM AREAS THAT WE HAVE REALLY OKAY SAID. WE'RE DELIGHTED EXPANDED TO MEET THE MOMENT. I DO WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON OUR OTHER THREE STRATEGIES. THAT WE ARE DOING TO RESPOND. THE SECOND STRATEGY IS ENGAGE OF THE IS REALLY BEEN AMONG. OFFER OLDER TOLD. OF THERE'S MORE COMMERCE. OF OUR AGING THERE MAY BE HOW BEEN AND IN IN C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; A LONG TIME.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THERE'S CAMPAIGNS WE HAVE BEEN LEADING WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR INCLUDING ME. THE CAUCUSES- OF BOTH HOUSES HERE. OTHER CHECKING CAMPAIGN FIRST AND FOREMOST ON BEGAN MARCH FIFTEENTH ONE OLDER CALIFORNIANS WERE OUT TO STAY HOME AND HOW. OF AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE FOOD. THE MEDICINE. YOU CONNECTION OUR STATE WATER DOING. FOR THE CHECKING CAMPAIGN HAS BROUGHT IN ON HEALTH PLANS DONE A WONDER JOB ON I WANNA THANK OR HEALTHCARE DEPARTMENT AND PARTNERING IN REACHING OUT TO THE PLAN. FOR THE CALL ALL OF OUR PROGRAM OF COURSE THE WORLD TRYING TO REACH NEW FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE CONNECTED SO PARTNERING WITH L. TIMERS ASSOCIATION HEART LUNG CANCER. A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE STILL CALIFORNIA TO INVOLVE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND UNITED EMPLOYEES AT THE AIRLINE EMPLOYEES AND MAKING CALLS. UP WE WANT TO JUST GENERATE MORE AND MORE AND MORE CALLS IN THE FIRST MONTH WE WERE ABLE TO COUNT THE ONES SEVEN MILLION LPL CALLS MADE. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE CONGREGATIONS AND COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS MAKING CALLS ALL THE TIME BUT WE'RE NOT COUNTING AND WE JUST NEED TO KEEP THAT UP. THANK YOU CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAVE OUR WERE ON AND ONE SHOW FRIDAY. YEAH FOUR MAY WHICH IS OLDER AMERICANS MONTH AND THIS. YEAR THE THING IS MAKE YOUR MARK WE CAN OF NO THEME FOR THE WAY TO CELEBRATE LIFT UP ALL THE WAY THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ARE MAKING. YOUR MARK STAYING HOME- AND WE SAY YOU MAY BE STAYING AT HOME BUT YOU'RE NOT SITTING ON THE SIDELINES PEOPLE ARE DOING. ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO COMMUNITY. YOUR TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR FAMILIES TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH- AND REALLY MAKE THEIR MARK. ON OUR STATE THAT CRITICAL TIME AND WE THANK THEM AND- WHAT LIFT UP THE STORY. AND UP SACRIFICE AND LEADERSHIP AND PURPOSE AT THIS MOMENT. THE THIRD STRATEGY WE HAVE EMPLOYED IS REALLY. OF REPRODUCING FOR THE MOMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. ARE WE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE WERE FULL STEAM AHEAD HEADING- WORKING ON- RECOMMENDATION FOR AREAS ACROSS THE TEN YEAR PLAN BIRTH STATE AND LOCAL BLUEPRINTS. WELL WE'VE GOT ON PAUSE IN LATE MARCH. WE KNEW THAT- MANY OF OUR PARTICIPANTS MANY OF THE PUBLIC. I NEEDED TO FOCUS. LASER FOCUSED ON ON PUBLIC RESPONSE AND THAT HAVE BEEN WHERE WE'VE BEEN THE PAST SIX WEEKS- THAT SAID. IT WILL IT IT IS A TABLE OF SOME OF THE STATE'S LEADING EXPERTS AND SO IT MAKES. PERFECT SENSE THAT THEY ALSO WERE ABLE TO GIVE IT TO. THE RAPID RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAVE BEEN PRODUCING. BOTH FOR THE EQUITY WORKGROUP AND A FULL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SECRETARY. ALLEY TO CONSIDER ON EVERY FOR I FULLY TO RESIDENTIAL. PP TESTING ARE THEY BEEN RIGHT THERE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. AND NOW WE ARE READY TO COME BACK TO THE MASTER PLAN TABLE WE HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT ARE PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING OF MAY TWENTY EIGHTH WE WILL BE KEEPING RECONVENING OF COURSE IT'LL BE VIRTUAL AND A HALF DAY INSTEAD OF I PERSON IN A FULL DAY. AND WE'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION OUT ABOUT THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALL PARTICIPATE SAFELY BUT WILL BE REALLY LOOKING OUT WHAT WHERE DOES THE MASTER PLAN GO FROM HERE GIVEN ON THE LESSONS THAT WE ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO LEARN FROM THE CODE BUT EXPERIENCE HOW WILL THAT INFORM. AND DIRECT THE MASTER PLAN THE WAY FORWARD. AND ALSO HOW WE CAN PARTNER MORE DEEPLY BUT THE GOVERNOR DEL TIMERS ARE PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION TASK FORCE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY THERE. TO COMBINE AND- AND BE BETTER TOGETHER. THE MASTER PLAN YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT. AGAIN AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT PROCESS AND THAT PARTNERSHIP ALREADY BEING IN PLACE TO HELP US MAKE THIS MOMENT. AND THEN THE LAST THING ON SAY VERY BRIEFLY- MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN. ASKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT PHONE EFFORTS TO REINVENT AND STREAMLINED AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE WERE ABLE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. THE FIRST FEDERAL FUNDS FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE CHORE COUNTY AND NONPROFIT. AGING AGENCIES. WE HAVE A NEW DATA DASHBOARDS BUT WE CAN SHARE THAT'S REAL DATA. REAL TIME DATA. YOU KNOW QUICKER IF YOU CAN SEE THE TO THE RISING. ALL OF THEM THE RIGHT NEIL THE RISE. HEALTH COSTS. AND WE ARE TECHNOLOGY IN WAYS WELL SO. MORE TO DO THERE BUT CVA ON IT WAY. I THINK THE LAST THING ALSO BEFORE UP HERE QUESTION I DO ALL THE FALL FOR QUEST AND HOPE I HAVE. SPOKEN TO THEM AT LEAST IN SOME WAY AND HAPPY TO TAKE MORE. IS JUST TO. THE LEFT OF. GETS RECESSION. AS WE ENTER THIS ECONOMIC MOMENT THESE ARE PARTICULARLY PAINFUL. MEMORIES FOR THOSE AN AGING AND DISABILITY CMMUNITY BECAUSE OF- THE DEPTH OF THE CUTS THAT WERE MADE BAD AND HELD BILL THE MEMORY OF THAT LINGERS WITH ALL OF US. AND I THINK AS WE ENTER. WHAT IS. CLEARLY A TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES- I THINK SOME OF THE THOUGHT LESSON BUT THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING AND DISCUSSING WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE IS THE FOCUS ON THE WHOLE PERSON. THE WHOLE FAMILY AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. THAT WE THINK ABOUT ALWAYS THINK ABOUT PEOPLE- IS THE SUM OF ALL OF THEIR PART- AND HOLD THAT IN MIND. THAT WE DO BRING THE VALUE TO THE TABLE THAT WE ALL SHARE INCLUDING COLLABORATION INCLUSION WITH LEGISLATURE. AND STAKEHOLDERS. A EVEN IN VERY TOUGH TIME YOU LOOK FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- TO IMPROVE COORDINATION TO IMPROVE DESIGN- PERHAPS FORCED TO UP FOR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE CHOSEN BUT NONE THE LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO. TO MAKE TO MAKE PROGRESS EVEN EVEN EVEN IN. EVEN IN THE VERY VERY TOUGH TIME. SO WE WILL BRING LOOK LOOKING FORWARD- AS WE ENTER A ON CERTAIN AND UNCLEAR ECONOMIC PICTURE- BUT KNOW THAT WILL DO THAT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND OF COURSE WITH THE LEGISLATURE PERSON FOR MOST. WITHOUT ZERO POINT STOP AND I'M GLAD TO ADDRESS THE PANEL AND TAKING YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR MCCOY WEIGHED NEXT WE HAVE FRANK MECCA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M FRANK MCCONNELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS THE NATION ARE MEMBERSHIP MINISTER THE MAJORITY OF THAT THINKING THAT PROGRAMS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR JOHNSON IN HER TESTIMONY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AND THAT MAKE IT ONE LIKE ANYTHING AT THE END OF MY THIRTY YEARS WORKING IN SERVICES. THANK YOU EVERY PROGRAM THE- AND EVERY CLIENT- THAT WE SERVE ALMOST FIFTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE TOUCHED BY COMMUNITY SERVICES AGENCY AT SOME POINT IN THE YEAR. WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED REALLY EXCELLENT AND HUMANE LEADERSHIP INDICATE THE- PANDEMIC. AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXCELLENT PARTNERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AS WE MET UNPRECEDENTED TIME THAN I SHOULD SAY. I CAN JUST TAKE COUNTY PARTNERSHIP ALL PERFECT THAT IS ALWAYS THE KEY THAT THAT WOULD SERVICE BROKE. BUT NEVER MORE URGENTLY THAN DURING A CRISIS. CAN I HELP FOCUSED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING THE COUNTY MISTER LEVEL AT THE GRAY LEVEL. WITH THE NIGHT OF THE BUT ALSO A YOU TO GET RECOGNITION OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PRIOR RECESSION. THAT WE LIVED THROUGH WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED A MEMO TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND TO THE GOVERNOR THAT OUTLINES COMPREHENSIVELY ARE THOUGHT. ABOUT HOW THE STATE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN MEET THE HUMAN SERVICES THE POPULATION. MICHAEL OBSERVATION WOULD BE THAT SIX. THINKING UP THIS FOR TRY BLACK. IF THEY WORK WELL JAMIE TO GROW DEMAND. AND I THINK THAT THE TAP OF YOUR STATE BEING ADDED AS- AND- PEOPLE FALL UNEXPECTEDLY- INTO ECONOMIC AND SECURITY ARE WE THERE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND I SHOULD SAY THAT. I'M I'M PROUD IN CALIFORNIA THAT- ARE SPEAKING AT HAS BEEN QUITE RESPONSIVE. TWO THE UNPRECEDENTED. DIRECTOR JONATHAN MENTIONED THE APRIL YEAR OVER YEAR NUMBERS OF INCREASE APPLICATION A DOUBLING ALMOST IN CALIBRATION- ABOUT A FOR CAL WORK. DIRECTOR JUMP NOT TO MENTION HOW THE COUNTY THERE SOARED MEETING THE CHALLENGE WE VERY QUICKLY AND NIMBLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR SERVICES ACT THAT THE SERVICES ALL AT THE SAME TIME. AREN'T MANAGING THROUGH SHELTERING ORDERS IN KEEPING OUR STATE STAFF AND- A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND HARD WORK- AND- I SHOULD POINT OUT- SEXUAL SHOUT OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THAT COMPUTER SYSTEM THE THOUGHT THAT. WHO WORKED INCREDIBLY QUICKLY AND NIMBLY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE MANY EXCELLENT CHANGES THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ONE TIME RESOURCES ALSO THAT THE GOVERNOR ADDED- WITH THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP BUT- ACCOMMODATE THIS REALLY DRAMATIC SPIKE IN AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT BECAUSE THIS COMING AND WE BELIEVE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT. GOING TO- RICH. AS QUICKLY AS ANY OF US WOULD LIKE- I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A WORKLOAD UBBLE BECAUSE SOME OF THE WORKLOAD. MODIFICATION THAT WERE MADE FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR ISSUED A MORATORIUM ON ITS CONTINUANCE. BUT AT SOME POINT THE WORKLOAD HAVE TO BE DONE BY COUNTY SO THE WORKLOAD WITH JUST HEARD NOT A LIMITED COMPLETELY FELL AS WE EMERGE FROM EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT THEY EXPIRE AND AS WE SEE AN INCREASE DEMAND FROM PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR SERVICE SAYS ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THAT IF WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL INTENTIONAL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING IN MANAGING THE WORKLOAD BUBBLE SO THAT WE CAN TIME WE NEED. WE NEED THE PEOPLE PER LIFESAVING LIKE OF STAVING ASSISTANT THAT BEING. AND ONE LAST THING THAT WE CAN LEARN THE HARD WAY FROM THE GREAT RECESSION IN RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION BUDGET DECISION SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE THE HUMAN SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE. MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT IN A MOMENT FOR THE HUMAN SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE BE TO BE ABLE TO NEED TIMELY AND ACCURATELY THE DEMAND OF PEOPLE. FOR YOU CHRISTIAN AT THE INTERNET CANNOT MAKE IT THE AND THE THING THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HAT- WE SELL DECIMATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT AND YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES- TO RESUME SERVICE SAID. YOUR WITH STEP GET THAT IT NEEDED TO BACK UP. AND SO THE WHIPPED FOLLOWING. BETWEEN DEEP CUT AND THEN THE DESIRE TO RE EMERGE- I THINK EXACERBATED THE RECESSION. LENGTHEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RESUME MEETING PEOPLE'S NEEDS IN THE WAY THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE ONE. MY SECOND OBSERVATION IS ONE THAT YOU KNOW WELL MISTER CHAIR- AND BE HEALED THE HUMAN COST OF THE PROPERTY THINKING IT IS SIGNIFICANT- WE'VE SEEN THAT NUMBER COULD I TALK ABOUT IN DIRECTOR JOHN GOING T TALK ABOUT REALLY SPEAKS TO. THAT THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE IN HER EXPERIENCE BEING ECONOMIC AND SECURITY. ARE COUNTY BROUGHT THAT WOULD NOT SIGNIFICANT PLAYERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HOMELESSNESS SERVICES INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT ROOM KEY. AND WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THAT HAD MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET AND TO KEEP THEIR BENEFIT. WE STRONGLY ADVOCATED FOR THEM AND WORKED REALLY HARD TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR- LEADERSHIP AND PUTTING THEM FOR. WE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND JUNE- AND I THINK WE NEED TO- LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING- IN THE ECONOMY THAT FAMILIES AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO SEE. WHICH OF THOSE. FEATURES THAT WERE ISSUED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE AND THE CABLE CALVET TIME LIMIT- I THINK THAT THE- RECESSION IN THE PANDEMIC. DEMONSTRATE CONCLUSIVELY THAT THEY DON'T HELP. ARM AND THEY SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. BUT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EXTRA RESOURCES THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PUT INTO HOMELESSNESS THE CREATIVITY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'M WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS- THAT MIGHT SUBJECT PERMANENT WAYS THAT WE CAN- COME TO THINK THAT WE CAN DO AS WE MOVE FORWARD- TO KEEP SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING THAT ARE WORKING. ACT AS- AS ARE A PART OF OUR HOMELESSNESS. COMBAT EFFORT TO THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. SO WE LOOK AT FUTURE WE'RE NOT WELL CUNNINGHAM INTERPRETED EIGHT NOW PERHAPS BETTER THAN. THE TYPICAL POSITION MY HAT AND WE URGE YOU TO MAINTAIN BENEFITS LEVEL THE MOST VULNERABLE. DON'T LEAVE OUT ON DOCKING PEOPLE ARE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IF YOU WERE SUPPORT AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT MOST OF THEM ARE ARE YEAH IT'D BE AM PLEASED WITH IT THAN CHILDREN WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PROVIDED VITAL SUPPORT. FOR UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AND I THINK WE THIS CAN GO FURTHER BY ALLOWING PEOPLE FILE. THAT COULD INDICATE NUMBERS. TO ACT AT THE STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT- WE ALSO THINK THAT WE SHOULD LEVERAGE OUR HUMAN SERVICES LINKS HOME WITH MATH PROGRAM BUILT WITHIN THE COWL WORKS PROGRAM IN THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAM AND YOU DAHLE PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM- YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND AT AN AD ENACTED PROGRAMS THAT ARE USED TO PREVENT PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING THOSE PROGRAMS THOUGH CALLARD FAMILY FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCENT THAT CALVERT COUNTY SUPPORT PROGRAMS TO PREVENT. HOMELESSNESS AND CAN. RE HOUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING THOSE PROGRAM ON ONE OF THE BIG FEARS. ARM AND LEGITIMATE THREAT THAT THE PANDEMIC LED RECEPTION- THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR IS THAT POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ALMOST AND WE HAVE AFFECTED PROGRAM AS PART OF OUR HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE. I'M IF I SAY ANYTHING TODAY THAT DEBT I HOPE YOU REMEMBER IT THERE. THE DAMAGE OF DEEP POVERTY TO CHILDREN IS OFTEN TURNING. SO AT THE CHAIR POINTED OUT IN HIS OPENING REMARKS EVEN ONE SPELL A DEEP POVERTY CAN AFFECT A CHILD'S FOR THEIR LIFETIME. WE DON'T GET A DO OVER WE DON'T GET TO DO GOOD WE DON'T GET TO DEFER THE MAINTENANCE ON A CHILD TO BRING IT'S NOT LIKE FIXING A ROUTE. SO WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. BUT FOR THE TOXIC EFFECTS. OF NOW TREATMENT OF ECONOMIC INSECURITY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T- DO ANYTHING TO EXACERBATE. THAT AS TROUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE THE THAT THE MINISTER TRIAL MIKE CHANT THE- PERMANENTLY- WE DIDN'T DO THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION- WE MAKE CUT. TO BENEFIT LEVEL. WE DID NOT PROVIDE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT COULD BENEFIT LEVELS AND WE DID BECAUSE IT IS ONE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN THE POVERTY. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTEMPT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE IT SO THAT NO CHILD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVER LET THEM BE POVERTY WE SHOULD CONTINUE THAT. ARE THAT EFFORT- AND WE SHOULD NEVER DO WE DID- IN RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION AGAIN. THE THIRD POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE AND THAT SAFETY NET SERVICES ARE COUNTER RECESSIONARY. WE KNOW THAT BENEFITS RECEIVED BY LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE TYPICALLY HAD A HIGHER MULTIPLIER EFFECT THAN OTHERS- TRACK THE GOVERNMENT AID. BUT BECAUSE LOW INCOME PEOPLE SPEND THEIR MONEY. THEY HAVE TO I'M GONNA GET. INTO COMMUNITY THAT HAS A MULTIPLIER EFFECT. ONE OTHER LEFT AND WE LEARN FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION FROM THE GREAT RECESSION IS THE TARGETED EMPLOYMENT YOU'RE GETTING YOUR GAME. CAN ACTUALLY HELP BUSINESSES GET BACK ON THEIR FEET PARTICULARLY I AM SPEAKING ABOUT SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT- IN THE WAKE OF THE GREAT RECESSION PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STIMULUS PROGRAM. SO CALLED ARE- GAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WE USED TO RAMP UP SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WHERE WE TEMPORARILY AND PARTIALLY SUBSIDIZE THE WAGES OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE WILLING TO HIRE OUR CLIENT. WE PUT ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES INTERCEPT THAT I'D BEEN POINTED JOB. IT'S GOOD FOR CLIENTS BECAUSE THE ABSENT THE OF THE ABILITY TO GET IN ON A NON THOUGHT THAT I JOBS YOU GIVE THEM WORK EXPERIENCE WE GIVE THEM REAL WAGE BATESINCOME THAT THEY CAN'T DÃ¢N PAR LES INTO EVEN MORE RESOURCES VIA THAT FEDERAL AND STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. FOR BUSINESSES THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF REDUCES THE COST FOR THEM. TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHICH IS TO RE EMPLOYED PEOPLE. TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS SAYS- AN INCREASE THEIR WORK FORCE. AND SO WHILE WE MAY NOT GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY AS WE DID DURING THE OBAMA STIMULUS PROGRAM WE DO HAVE A STATE SEVEN THAT THAT THAT I'D COMPLAIN THAT PROGRAM AS PART OF IT AS PART OF CAL WORK. WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE EXISTING PROGRAM- AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TARGETED CALL THAT RESPONSE RELATED TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN LIGHT AND- THE RECESSION THAT THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO- WE SHOULD THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER. LEVERAGING SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT AS A STRATEGY THAT WORK NOT JUST FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE BUT ALSO FORGET. AND THE FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE MISTER CHAIR. ONE AT THE RECTOR JOHNSON ALLUDED TO. AND I'M TURNING MY ATTENTION NOW TO THE PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY MATERNITY AGENT. PERHAPS OUR BIGGEST FEAR ADDED PANDEMIC. THE REALITY THAT ABUSE AND NEGLECT FLOURISH IN ISOLATION. WE RELY ON OUR COMMUNITY TO BE THE EYES AND EARS TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR BOTH CHILD MALTREATMENT AN ADULT MALE TREATMENT- WHEN CHILDREN AREN'T IN SCHOOL WHEN ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE SHELTERED AND PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE LOOKING IN ON AND CAN- CHILD. MALTREATMENT CAN INCREASE- AT DIRECTOR JONATHAN POINTED OUT WE ARE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY THAT IN ABOUT A 50% REDUCTION IN REFERRAL TO OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE HOTLINE LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT CHILDREN LEARN IN SCHOOL THAN THAT SCHOOL THAT THE BIGGEST THREAT. REPORTER OF AN EVENING LACK. WITH RESPECT TO EL BEAT AND NEGLECT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH ISOLATE. IS THE NUMBER ONE RISK FACTOR FOR ABUSE AND NEGLECT INCLUDING SELF NEGLECT FOR THE ELDER FOR ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT- YOU KNOW FOR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT COUNTY REALIGNMENT FUN PROVIDE THE LION'S SHARE OF NON FEDERAL CAUGHT. BY CHILD ABUSE AND ELDER ABUSE DOES REALIGNMENT BONNIE IN SOCIAL SERVICES CONTACT ARE LARGELY FAILED BACK FUND. COUNTIES ANTICIPATE A STEEP DECLINE IN THE IN THAT FUNDING NUMBER THINKING IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS AND 20% THEM WE HOPE NOT IT IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS. THAT THE REALIGNMENT LEGISLATION THAT CREATED BOTH THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT PROGRAM NEVER ANTICIPATED. THERE IS NO STATUTORILY REQUIRED OR CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED GENERAL FUND BACKSTOPS. RELIEF PROGRAM SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE LARGELY STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATE COUNTY ONLY HAVE THE REALIGNMENT REVENUES WITH NO GUARANTEED PROTECTION FROM THE STATE- TO SURPRISED TO PROVIDE A SAFETY NET BETWEEN THEM. ON HOW HE GENERAL REVENUE- ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL. THE REALIGNMENT STRUCTURE ONE NOT BUILT TO HANDLE A STEEP DECLINE IN REVENUE OF THE LIKE OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE UNDERSTATEMENT COUNTY SIMPLY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ABOUT YOUR NEEDS REVENUE THAN YOUTH PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE FEELING OF STATE OBLIGATION TO TRUE UP COUNTY CAUGHT UNDER THAT CPR INITIATIVE. OR IF NEVER DOUBLE THAT SERVICE ARE GOING TO BE DE CUT SIR A FEW PEOPLE ARE BEING ABUSED IN A- OVER AT RISK OF BEING ABUSED NEGLECTED INCLUDING CHILDREN. WITH RESPECT TO THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES PROGRAM IN FOSTER CARE I THINK WE NEED TO PARTICULARLY FOCUS. ON SUPPORTING CARE GIVERS SO THAT WE HAVE SAFE LOVING PLACES FOR CHILDREN TO HEAL FROM THE NOW TREATMENT THAT THEY SUFFERED. WE ANTICIPATE. A BUBBLE IN KID COMING INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHEN KIDS GO BACK TO SCHOOL. AND WE WILL GET MORE REFERRAL FOR THE HOTLINE. AS A DIRECTOR JOHNSON POINTED OUT- WE DO HAVE- SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT COURT CLOSURES HAD CAUSED SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD BACKLOG ON IN THE DEPENDENCY COURT. SO FAMILY REUNIFICATION NOT HAPPENING OR- GUARDIANSHIP SIR ADOPTION- THE BACKING UP OF THAT WORK IS ALSO GOING TO CREATE A WORKLOAD BUBBLE. AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE- I THINK A TICKET AGAIN ISSUE WITH HAVING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF A GOOD LOBBYING RESOURCE FAMILY. IN ORDER TO SURE UP- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE RESOURCE GAMBLING ARM AND BRING THEM INTO THE SYSTEM IN A THAT STREAMLINED AWAY IF POSSIBLE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR- CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED. THE CHAIRS PLEDGES LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM THE FIRST SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES AN EMERGENCY HOTLINE AND A MOBILE RESPONSE FOR CHILDREN- FAMILIES. THAT ARE HAVING AN URGENT SITUATION THAT OTHERWISE COULD RESULT IN A PLACEMENT DISRUPTION OR A CALL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ALSO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STREAMLINING THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS THAT THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE BRING FAMILIES THEN AND THAT THEM ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE- EXCELLENT CARE GIVERS- AND WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THAT EFFECT. IN THE LETTER THAT WE PROVIDED TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH RESPECT TO VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO ALL WE CAN APPRECIATE THE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CHECK IN ON PEOPLE- WHO ARE WHO CAN'T BE- CHECKED IN BY THE PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM BECAUSE OF SHELTERING REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INTERVENE AS WE EMERGED FROM ISOLATION AND WE INEVITABLY THE- ABUSE AND NEGLECT INCLUDING SELF NEGLECT THAT OCCURRED. ON DURING THE SHELTERING PERIOD. WE ALSO IN THAT POPULATE IS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO HOMELESSNESS- MOM AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD LEVERAGE THE HOME STATE PROGRAM. WHICH ARE HOMELESSNESS SERVICES THAT WE CAN USE TO PREVENT. AND TO RE HOW VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE NOW- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER MAC ISLAND NEXT WE HAVE A MORE I'LL DO JOLLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

NOT ONLY IN OUR LOCAL. DIRECTOR CAL FRESH. CAL WORK. MEDI CAL IN GENERAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE ALSO SEEN A HUGE INFLUX. AND R. ET DE OFFICE WHERE. OUR STATE WORKERS HAVE STOOD ON THE FRONT NINE. ELEVEN AFTER THAT TO THE- WORKING. AND THE COMMON. INTERESTS RIGHT. THE MANNER. IN A RECESSION BE KICKING. INCREASE AND THE MAN OF OUR STATE. SERVICES AND- I THINK MR MEGA ALLUDED TO THIS. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT PREPARED FOR THE INFLUX AND- UNFORTUNATELY OFTENTIMES BACKED BY CHOICE. AND HOPEFULLY IN THE CRISIS WE MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES THIS TIME. PROJECT LOOP KEY I THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF HOW. WE CAN BE CREATIVE AND YOU CAN OPERATE THE STATE. DELTA MOST VULNERABLE. WE ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN OUR ELIGIBILITY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. WE'VE BEEN VERY CREATIVE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS TO DO THAT. BUT AGAIN AS OUR PARTNERS IN THE WELFARE DIRECTORS MAKE. IT BACK WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE AND INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ATTRACT THAT BACKLOG. WE HOPE THERE'S SOME ATTENTION THE TORONTO. AT DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE NEAR.

TO CREATE. WE HAVE WHAT'S UP THE BY THE IN IT OKAY HAVE TO BE VERY CREE AND THAT. TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T ASK FOR HELLO CAN BE QUITE A- ADVOCATE AND HELP. AND. LIVE IT BUT HAVE A LIMIT AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE COULD BE COME BACK BILL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND WE ALSO KNOW AND WERE FULLY COMMITTED TO THE REVENUE OPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE. WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL AT THAT TO GET YOU CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS TO DO THAT. WE WANT TO CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS BIG AND SMALL. BEFORE WE CAN FEDERAL BUDGET THAT HURT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO SHOULDERS WE CANNOT TODAY. AND WHO SERVICES WE WANT TO DELIVER TO THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY.

WE KNOW THAT WILL HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS TOGETHER AND. HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I NOW WANT TO TURN TO THE MEMBERS AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL AND WOULD ASK THAT YOU PLEASE DIRECT THE QUESTIONS TO A SPECIFIC PANELISTS AND FOR THE PANELISTS PLEASE ON MUTE YOURSELVES WHEN YOUR NAME IS CALLED AND RENEW YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE CONCLUDED. LOOKING FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS. THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS QUESTION IS GEARED TOWARDS- FRANK MECCA. AND BASED ON THE UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP IN FOSTER CARE NOW YOU'RE IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW THE COURTS NOW AREN'T GRANTING GUARDIANSHIP ARE REUNITING THE FAMILIES DURING THIS TIME AND WE KNOW THAT'S OF A VITAL STEP IN REUNITING- FOSTER CARE- CHILDREN WITH WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT. AS THIS ERA MOVES FORWARD AND THE FOCUS IS GOING TO BE GIVEN ON COVERT NINETEEN ISSUES. THAT BASICALLY- WE DON'T. START TO TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE PROTECTING- SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND IN FOSTER CARE IN MOVIE IN THOSE AREAS CONTINUALLY TO MOVE THOSE FORWARD SO HOW WOULD WE- BE MORE EQUIPPED TO ADVOCATE ON THOSE POSITIONS. YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. NUMBER MEANT- THAT DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TARGETED THE COUNTY THEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I HAVE BEEN WORKING. TO TRY TO ADDRESS ARE YOU GET HIGH PRIORITY IMPORTANT JUDICIAL ORDERS NAY. WHEN COURTS OF CLOTHES- THEIR PHANTOM PAST PRACTICE WITHOUT THEIR REGARDING- REMOTE REMOTE COURT- UP PROPERTY. THE CHIEF CHAPTER OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT HAD ISSUED- AN EMERGENCY RULE OF COURT ASKING COURTS TO PRIORITIZE- SOMEBODY SHE IF THEY CAN FOR LIKE A GUARDIANSHIP FOR A REUNIFICATION. I'M IT ARE EXPERIENCE THAT I'M IN SOME AREAS NO THE COURTS ARE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY- AND IN AND SORT OF KEEP THE KEEP THE WORKLOAD MOVING THROUGH THE COURT AND IN OTHER PLACES. ON ANY BLACKING SO- WE HAVE A LETTER TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WITH SOME RECOMMENDATION- OPT FOR. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RULED CLARIFICATION- THAT WE THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT LETTER- WITH THE COMMITTEE. OF MORE BROAD SPEAKING LAST ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT WE MAINTAIN- CHILD PROTECTION IN FOSTER CARE IMPORTANT SERVICES FOR ABUSED AND NEGLECTED KIDS AND FAMILY I THINK THE BIGGEST RISK- IN THE NEAR TERM THE PROGRAM IS THE FUNDING FOR. THE LION'S SHARE OF THE NON FEDERAL MONEY THAT WE USE TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES. ON IT IS PROVIDED THROUGH COUNTY REALIGNED AND THERE WERE THERE WERE TWO WHEEL ALIGNMENT. OUR LEGISLATION ONE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND ONE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THAT FIRST PARTIALLY AND THEN ALMOST FULLY GAVE THE COUNTY TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING THE NON FEDERAL SHARE THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. ON IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHARE OF THE STATE THE HELP THAT. I'M BUILD LIKE THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE- NOR THEY BUILT TO. CANDIDATE REALLY DRAMATIC DOWNWARDS SPIKE IN REVENUE THEN I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE TESTED- SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN CORE SERVICES TO KEEP KIDS SAFE- AND TO AND TO PROMOTE THEIR HEALING- AND I DON'T SEE ANY WAY THAT HAPPENS WITHOUT THE STATE IN THE COUNTY WORKING TOGETHER. TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY TO BRING RIPPING YOU INTO BUT TRIP BUT WE ALIGNMENT REVENUES SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY DECLINE IN THE MANNER THAT PEOPLE FEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- WITH- YOUR PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW SCHOOLS- ARE IN SESSION AND THEN FOR A LOT FOR A LOT OF CASES THAT'S THE FRONT LINE OF REPORTING- CHILD ABUSE ONCE WE START TO MOVE FORWARD AND OPEN UP THE SCHOOLS AGAIN. DO YOU ANTICIPATE A HIGHER RATE OF REPORTING OF CHILD ABUSE ONE SCHOOLS OPEN UP AGAIN. CERTAINLY DO ASSEMBLYMAN YET. THANK YOU FOR THAT- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST ONE OTHER COMMENT TO- IT WAS TALKED ABOUT. THE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MOST VULNERABLE THAT WERE OUT THERE BUT AGAIN- LET ME MENTION ANOTHER MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THAT'S THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION THAT SEEMS TO GET LOST. WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING ALL OF US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS. YOU KNOW I WANT TO START MY QUESTIONS- WE HAD INITIALLY POSED THIRTY EIGHT QUESTIONS TO THIS PANEL AND SO I WILL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT REALLY WANTED TO THE GROUND MYSELF AND FRAME THIS IF I COULD IN WHAT FRANK MAC- STARTED AND SAID. WHICH S THAT THE SAFETY NET EXISTS FOR TIMES LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW. AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CAL WORKS RECIPIENT WE HEARD OF HOW ESSENTIAL THAT AID IS AND WHAT IS. BOTH TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY WE HEARD ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE IT PLAYED IN ALLOWING HIM TO HAVE HOPE IN DARK TIMES WHEN HE WAS STRUGGLING. AND I LOOK TOWARDS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE LOOKING TOWARDS THESE. PROGRAMS IN THIS MOMENT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TRY TO DISMANTLE A BIT OF OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE WHICH HAS HAD INCOME INEQUALITY AND RACIAL DISPARITIES. AND INSTEAD FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS A BETTER PATH FORWARD. I THOUGHT THAT TIA OR SAID IT QUITE WELL THAT WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH OFTENTIMES ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHICH ARE AFFECTED AND- THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. BUT I DID WANT TO TURN MY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IF I COULD TO THE THREE DIRECTORS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO START WITH DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE NOT FOLLOWING IT I BELIEVE THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PANDEMIC EBT FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCHES AS WELL AS- AB T. WHICH WILL ALLOW DELIVERED AND- ONLINE SERVICES. WILL SIGNIFICANTLY HELP US TO MEET TO FOOD INSECURITY AND NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE MOMENT. BUT WANTED TO TALK IF I COULD DIRECTOR JOHNSON ABOUT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT CURRENTLY HAVE AND DATES AND- SOME OF THEM. COULD BE ENDING AS SOON AS JUNE AND JUST TO USE THE EXAMPLE THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED SWEET TALK ABOUT TIME CLOCKS. I THINK IT'S AWFULLY DIFFICULT WITH TIME CLOCKS TO. WONDER WHETHER OR NOT JUNE IS THE RIGHT STATE AND SO I'M WONDERING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO LOOK TOWARDS. A HOLD HARMLESS A VERSION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE TIME CLOCKS WERE INTENT DID. TO HELP TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN REAL TIME. ONE OF YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON. THANK YOU AT CHAIR- YES THEN YOU MAY THINKTHAT. YOU'RE USING IT OUTLINES IT GREAT POINTS AROUND AGAIN- HOW WE ALL INTRODUCED SPACE- WHAT WHERE THAT I DIDN'T FIND FLEXIBILITY THAN THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. BASED ON WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AT THE TIME- I THINK ACROSS THE BOARD ATTY CERTAINLY COULD SOME OF THE FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY THERE ARE KIND CONSTRAINTS AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN APPROVED FOR WAIVERS. AT THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO DO AS WELL AS WHAT WE AT REVIEW IN TERMS OF THE STATE FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU'VE LOOKING AT THESE COMPONENT AS WE SPEAK THAT TIME CLOCK FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU REFERENCED AT ARE SET TO EXPIRE JUNE THIRTY AS ARE MANY OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE I'M PROGRAMS. THAT WE ARE IN REAL TIME HAVE WEAK REVIEWING AND THINKING THROUGH AGAIN- IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE DURATION OF IT OUT WHERE WE WILL HAVE. ADDITIONAL POINTS AT EVERY EVERY MADE A WHOLE ORDER. IN HAND HOW WE WILL PROCEED SO BLACK ALL I CAN TELL YOU AT THIS POINT IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR- PROSPECT THE IN REVIEW OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IN WHERE ACT I WOULD BE. AT I CAN YOU PUT AND I WILL GIVE A- EXAMPLE IT AND THAT. I THINK WE DIED. A WORKING ON THE ACT. CAPABILITY EFFICIENT THE GET WE'RE LOOK AT TODAY. I KIND OF AS WELL TO IF THE DARKISH FEEDBACK CAN BE. A MORE PERMANENT IN ANY COMPONENT OF THESE PROGRAMS SO AND JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT YES WE ARE LOOKING AT AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE- IN THE TREMENDOUS LECTIN CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE- LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WHAT POTENTIALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TAKE. YEAH I JUST SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF ME I BELIEVE THAT. TIME CLOCKS REALLY DON'T ALLOW THIS PROGAM TO BE EFFECTIVE DURING THIS UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS AND OUR ECONOMIC RECESSION AND- WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIGURE OUT THE LENGTH OF A NEED TO HOLD HARMLESS. I DID WANNA TALK IF I COULD NOW ABOUT EMERGENCY FOOD AND TO KNOW THAT THEIR- AND THEY YOU HAD MENTIONED THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS HAD GONE UP TO THE MAXIMUM. BUT WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IMMEDIATE NEED FOR OUR FOOD BANKS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ORIGINAL EXECUTIVE ORDER AND MONEY. FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BEEN OUT AND DISTRIBUTED BUT THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ALLOCATION NEEDED IN THE MIDDLE OF MAY AND FOUR JUNE IN THE AMOUNTS OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS A WILLINGNESS OR ABILITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO REALLY LOOK TOWARDS OUR FOOD BANKS TO HELP US TO DISTRIBUTE- IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR YEAH I THINK THAT THE- NEED AT LEAST SEEN AND THE LADY AT. THE DISTRIBUTION IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD WHAT WE'VE LEARNED A PROPHECY BANKS- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRACK VERY CLOSELY. IDENTIFYING ANY ADMIT NEEDS AND WHAT BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE COMING- IN THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE THAT WILL BE COMING IN JULY IN WHERE THEY'RE POTENTIALLY ARE ANY GAPS- IN BETWEEN THAT PORTION BUT WE ARE TO BE SEEN AS- A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- BEFORE THE FINAL WE NEEDING RESPECTED FISCAL YEAR. AND I WILL BE CONSIDERING THAT. I DO WANT A NEW MOVE ON NOW IF I CAN TO DIRECTOR BARGE MEN. AND WANTED TO GET A SENSE IF I COULD FROM YOU DIRECTOR. REGARDING HOW THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE FARING AND REALLY WHAT THEIR TOP CONCERNS ARE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU DOCTOR RANDALL- IN AND PART OF THE CONCERN THAT THEY REYES OPENERS HAD SCARED I TALKED A LITTLE% BIT ABOUT THAT THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY NAVIGATE AND HAD THAT TO. FOURTEEN FAMILIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND SO MOVING- AWAY FROM FACE TO FACE VISIT THING GOING TO THE TELLER FURTHER- AND THEN BEING ABLE TO ADD A RAMP UP THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT. WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT WE DON'T CENTERS HAVE- HAD CONCERNS ON HOW DID THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH ELIGIBILITY YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO. THE OTHER PERSON OR TO ACCEPT AN INDIVIDUAL- FACE TO FACE AND- BE RESPONSIVE TO ELIGIBILITY BETWEEN EARLY START TO- LETTERMAN SERVICES. AND BEING ABLE TO DO THAT TRANSITION- TO EDUCATION- ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE THAT ARE JUST ENTERING OUR SYSTEM AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- IS THAT WERE HAVING AN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW WITH- CDP. ENTAIL HOW TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION FROM EARLY START TO EDUCATION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT WOULD NOT BE DETERMINED ELIGIBLE FOR ONGOING. SERVICE THE- BUT RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF. INTERVENTION SUPPORT YOUR EDUCATION SO THAT. THAT EXPRESSED THAT THEY CAN BATES SHARED BURNS AS TO HOW TO THE POOL PROVIDE. AND WHAT AT THINGS DIFFERENT BUT LIKE I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S REALLY BEEN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES- AND MAKING SRE THAT THEY HADTHE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT- NONRESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS TO DELIVER SERVICES IN A DIFFERENT WAY- THE OTHER IS TO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SUPPORT FAMILIES- BECAUSE THEY THEY HAD SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT- PARTICULARLY FAMILY THAT ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHLY COMPLEX. NEEDS THANK SURE THAT THE THEY CAN GET SERVER AND SUPPORT WE HAVE BIRD- FROM RESULT CENTERS THAT THEIR THEIR QUESTIONABLE WHAT'S NEXT AS FAR AS- HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH CONGREGATE STUDYING AND I KNOW OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS- AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE NEXT. COMING WEEKS THAT WE HAVE A SMALL GROUP AS TO THOSE NEXT STEPS FOR RE ENTRY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK TO BASICALLY- HAS INDIVIDUALS ACCESS THEM OF SERVICES THAT THEY HAD BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN- AND THAT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT WE DON'T CENTERS HAVE ASKED US- AND THEY ARE THEY'RE LOOKING INTO AND- REMAIN ENGAGED- WHAT THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN WITH- PROVIDER ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS TO- TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE NEXT STEPS- WE HOPE THAT ARE LIKE I SAID HAS HAD PIVOTED TO THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICE SOMEONE OF THAT. ALONG WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF IT IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE BEING RESPONSIVE TO A CALL THAT FAMILIES ARE MADE INTO THEM AND WILDLIFE I SAID NO OF THEM HAVE FOUND WORK OUT BEEN BEEN ABLE TO. THAT SOME OF THE OTHERS ARE LOOKING TO. THERE THE RESULT BANNERS. THE PRACTICES THAT HAD BEEN AFFECT AND SURE THOSE BARRIERS ARE A DRAFT. I AM A TO UP ONE TIME PERMITS IN THE- MECHANISM SO MUCH TELL HAS ALLOWED YOU TO ACCESS AS I DO THINK THERE ARE A FEW WAYS IN WHICH WE MAY RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC STRONGER THAN WE WENT INTO THIS AND- MANY OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE APPRECIATING THE OPPORTUNITY WHILE RECOGNIZING THEIR NOT A DIRECT REPLACEMENT. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOT FORGET WORKING YOU WITH THAT THANK YOU. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO- DIRECTOR MCCAULEY WEIGHT AND I THINK THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD FROM YOU- GOLDEN STATE FOR GOLDEN YEARS AND DIDN'T LIKE THAT QUITE A BIT- AS WELL AS- THIS IDEA THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE PERSON THE WHOLE. FAMILY I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC HEALTH TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THAT WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE ARE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND THAT IT REALLY DOES HELP US TO HAVE A STRONG- AGING OR ELDERLY POPULATION. AND WOULD REALLY WANT TO DATE AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS. REALLY CONCERNED WHEN LOOKING AT THE LESSONS FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND THE CUTS THAT CAME TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THAT I REALLY WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD SPEAK TO. THE LESSONS LEARNED DIRECTOR MCCOY WHAT AID FROM THE LAST RECESSION WE WENT THROUGH. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I AND I BELIEVE I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDITS DUE THAT I BELIEVE ARE GOVERNOR. GOLDEN STATE FOR THE GOLDEN YEARS SO- WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T DO THAT. YES THERE ARE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED AND IN MANY WAYS- THEY ECHO WHAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND- FRANK MAC I HAVE SAID- SO ELOQUENTLY ABOUT CHILDREN YOU KNOW I MEAN OFTEN WHAT IS. TRUE FOR. EIGHT YEAR OLDS IS ALSO TRUE FOR EIGHT ZERO THEN WE REALLY TRIED TO LOOK AT- THE END OF THE LIFE CYCLE. AND THE- WHERE THE NEEDS ARE FOR HELP. OR HOUSING. FOR COMMUNITY HER FAMILY FOR MENTAL HEALTH. ALL THAT GOOD CHRISTIAN ALL THAT GOES INTO THRIVING. I THINK. WE BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY- AT THAT POINT PERSON IN A WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH- WRECK IN I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE CO GOOD EXPERIENCE- IT'S BEEN A TEACHER. EVEN HARSHER LESSONS ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE LOVE THAT THE COURT. CHANGER FALL AWAY THAT THE RISK OF CASCADING CONSEQUENCES- WHEN IT GETS HARDER TO GET THAT MAIL IF YOU LOSE THAT VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY THAT SOME PORTENT FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION- DOES THAT LEAD TO MORE DECLINE. MORE HEALTHCARE COSTS MORE CRISIS CARE RESPONSE- THAT END UP BEING SO COSTLY SO I THINK. YEAH WANT TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PERSON WELL LOOK AT THE WHOLE FAMILY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND REALLY THE WHOLE CAR IF WE CAN- BE DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL. CHOICES AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT AGAIN AS ALL OF THE PALATABLE DRAFT IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SO. POWERFULLY WELL WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE'RE NOT ALL EXPERIENCING THIS TOGETHER- AND THERE ARE CUMULATIVE IN PREVIOUS- DISCRIMINATION INEQUITIES DISINVESTMENT THAT OR- BEARING BEARING UP HERE- WE SEE AGAIN IN THE- QUICKLY IN THE DEATH RATE. AMONG OLDER ADULTS PRICKLY MY AFRICAN AMERICAN OLDER ADULTS AS WELL AS PACIFIC ISLANDER- AND WHAT'S YOU KNOW OLDER ADULTS- AND SO WE DO NEED TO. ASK OURSELVES WHY THAT'S HAPPENING AND AS WE NAVIGATE THE UNCERTAIN AND CHALLENGING HEALTH AND ECONOMIC REALITY THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS- NOT BE ONE SIZE FITS ALL- BE MINDFUL OF AGAIN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OVER TIME OR- OFFER MULTIPLE SERVICES. GEN REALLY DO LEAD TO OUR DIFFERENT OUTCOME AND HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THE LIFE ITSELF. I WAS WONDERING DIRECTOR MCCOY WAIT IF YOU COULD SPEAK ABOUT THE FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES AND OUR SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THEM. AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED- I THINK THIS IS. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE CAN HAVE TO HELP TO BREAK CASE ISOLATION IS TO HELP TO DELIVER WARM MEALS VIA THIS PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S-SINGLE AGAINST THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO. INCREASE ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE DURING THIS CRISIS AND JUST WANT TO HEAR MORE DETAILS IF I COULD. THANK YOU YES WE REALLY DO HAVE TO LIFT UP THE STRONG FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP THAT HAS THAT HAS BEEN AFFECT HERE WITH THE OLDER AMERICANS NUTRITION PROGRAMS THE BEDROCK. OF PROGRAM- WE'RE SO GRATEFUL- THAT THANK YOU THE FAMILY FIRST ACT DID PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO CALIFORNIA FOR- WHAT USED TO BE HOME AND COMMUNITY MAIL BUT OF COURSE NOW THEY'RE ALL. ALSO TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND TVA RECEIVE THAT A DISTRIBUTED THAT. IN RECORD TIME I BELIEVE UNDER THREE WEEKS. OUT TO OUR COUNTY AND NONPROFIT AGING AGENCIES WHO HAVE THE FUN AND ARE USING THEM TO FIT BOTH NEW NUMBERS MAKE THOSE NEW NEEDS- BOTH PEOPLE WHO NOW NEED MORE MALE- AND PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE A COMMUNITY AND FOR NOW HOME- AND NEW PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T NEED THE- HELP WITH MEAL BEFORE. SO WHERE WERE VERY- PROUD OF THOSE NUMBERS EXPECT THOSE NUMBERS TO CONTINUE TO GROW WE ARE- AWAITING ANY MOMENT AND I'M I'M HOPING I CHEN. THING IS THAT IT WILL ARRIVE FOR ONE THING IT YEAH NEXT BACK IN CALIFORNIA- THE CARE THAT. SEVEN AN OLDER MALE THE COP HELLO. SIGNIFICANT BUT BEGAN. ALSO OKAY HAVE KIND OF THE NEUTRAL NAME A THE COURT OF SERVICES THAT IT MAY REALLY ARE LIKE. FOR THAT THEY ARE EVERYTHING BUT HEALTH AND ENGAGE. Q. LEGAL. TO DIGITAL DIVIDE TWO OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY A WHOLE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT ARE COUNTY AND WHAT NONPROFIT PARTNERS OF THE LIVE RING IN NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS I MENTIONED THE FRIENDSHIP LINE. SO MUCH MORE IT'S HAPPENING. YOU AYE SURE THAT- THE OLDER PEOPLE ARE AT HOME AND AT HOME UNDER ANY DO IT DIFFERENT WAYS WE SPOKE. WITH WELL BEING. AND IT ALSO SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS. AGAIN THE LARGEST PORTION CARE GIVING IN THE STAKEHOLDER. CALIFORNIA IS. AND THE AND PAN IN THE BROADEST SENSE OF FAMILY OF CHOICES THE FAMILY WE DEFINE. AS TO HOW THE FOR ALL THE WOULD BE YOUR DURING I PARENTS. ALL O. OUR CHILDREN. OF OUR CARING FOR TO WE'VE GOT TO KNOW ARE THAT FAMILY AND FRIEND THEY'RE GIVING A HUGE. AND THEN AGAIN ADDITIONAL RESOURCESFOR- THE ALL BUT THEN PROGRAM WHICH IS REALLY HELPED AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM FACILITIES- ALL ACROSS THE STATE LONG TERM CARE- BUT THEY'RE MAKING CALLS- TO READ. THEY CAN ALONG WHEN THE FACILITY CURRENTLY BETTER CALLING AND CHECKING IN THE FAMILY CRAP. YEAH ARE TRYING TO DO. WE CAN DO I'M GROUP THAT. THE OF COURSE MAY A PART LINE ON TO COMPLY OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT FACILITY SO THAT FEDERAL THE TO BE FOR MILLION THIS ANYTHING NOW TO. AND AGAIN TO SEE AND THEY GO WE WILL. TO GET THAT OUT TO OUR COUNTY A NONPROFIT AGING PARTNERS. AND I PROBABLY WILL AND WITH JUST A STATEMENT DIRECTOR MCCOY WEIGHED BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHO. ARE QUITE INTERESTED IN THE AREAS OF OUR STATES THAT ARE BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND INTERNET DESERT AND WOULD JUST. CONTINUE TO IMPLORE US TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS FOR THAT AS IT HELPS. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS SERVICES. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON TO FRANK MAC- IF I COULD AND ASK HIS PERSPECTIVE ON OUR- AS THE LEGISLATURE BOTH CODIFYING AND OR EXTENDING WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND OR AT THE- APARTMENT. GUIDE REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM YOU FRANK IS WHAT EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE ON COUNTIES. YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MECCA WOULD CLEARLY BE A I THINK I THINK THAT AN ABRUPT TERMINATION OF FOR EXAMPLE THE MORATORIUM ON- TERMINATION. IT CERTAINLY CREATE A BUBBLE EFFECT SO THAT AT THE SAME TIME YOU MIGHT HAVE. QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR AID OR WHO ARE NEEDING CARE WHATEVER THEIR- CAKE MAINTENANCE BAD WEATHER AT THE NORMAL RENEWAL. BUT THEN YOU HAVE THE BACKLOG OF WORK- FOR. WORKLOAD THAT YOU UST BURKE- IT GENTLY CREATE THE WILL OF WORKLOAD BURDEN FOR THE COUNTY- ULTIMATELY THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THAT THE CLIENTS AND SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT IF YOU HAVE THE TIME- DID YOU BOTH SOMETHING DOESN'T GET DONE. BUT ALSO FOR THE CLIENT JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING. YEAH YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT. HE TO BE A YOU KNOW OUR VALUE IS AND IF THEY CAN'T ECONOMIC BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS. LIKE AN EVENING OUT OF SOME OF THOSE PROVISIONS IN EXTEND PAST JUNE COULD BE HELPFUL. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE- ADD COUNTY EMERGE FROM ALMOST COMPLETE REMOTE. ACCESS AND TRY TO PROP THAT THE VOLUME OF THE WORK FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NEWLY IN NEED OF OUR SERVICES. AND SO. WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO SAY LOOK LET'S MAKE JUNE SEPTEMBER BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT BOTH EXTENDING THE PERIOD. AND ALSO EATING OUR WAY OUT OF IT- UNDERSTANDING THAT THEIR AUTOMATION IMPLICATIONS AND YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF OTHER OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS BUT IF THE CONVERSATION WE WANT TO HAVE- WITH RESPECT TO TIME LIMITS I THINK IT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION YET ON THE SPENDING TIME ON THAT BUT- I CAN'T GET IT NOW FOR THE TRYING TO ASK OURSELVES- GIVEN MAKES THAT. THE COLLEGE FOR EXAMPLE THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH TIME LIMIT. IS A TIME LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS IN YOUR LIFE YOU CAN RECEIVE WELFARE TO WORK SERVICES. SO FOR A CLIENT YOU MAY HAVE EXT WHO WILL MAY HAVE USED UP THEIR WELFARE TO WORK SERVICES GOT A JOB- I DIDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE- THE JOB DOESN'T EXIST THE INDUSTRY IS HAVING A HARD TIME COMING BACK. AND NOW THE PERSON WOULD LIKE TO BE RETRAINED FOR SOMETHING ELSE. THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT EXPIRED IN ON CAL WORKS. PART TIME AND IT SAID WE CAN HELP YOU. WITH THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT SERVICE BUT WITH SOME LIMITED EXCEPTION SO- I CAN NOW. IS THE BEST TIME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE UTILITY OF DOES NOT PROMOTE JUST ON THE FISCAL STANDPOINT BUT- DO THEY WORK AS INTENDED DOES THE TIME LIMIT ACTUALLY HAVE IT INTENDED EFFECT WOULD BE INTENDED TO FALL. ALL OF OUR EXPERIENCE. AT THE LINE LEVEL WORKING WITH CLIENTS. AND THE OPINION- EXPERTS LIKE MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH WHO WE ARE WORKING WITH TO MODERNIZE OUR WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM. A DAY HURT MORE THAN THEY HELP AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE A DAMAGE- IN A CLEAR CRAP THAT TECHNICAL LANGUAGE BUT- UTILIZE THE MOMENT TO REFLECT ON SOME OF THE- POLICIES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. SOME OF WHICH IN PART AS A RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION AFTER CELL WHY DO WE STILL HAVE WITH THE VALUE THAT THEY HAD AND I THINK THAT ONE. WE CERTAINLY COME DOWN ON THE SIDE THAT WE OUGHT TO GET RID OF IT AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATUREAND THE ADMINISTRATION. WHEN ENGAGED IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND I WILL- JUST BORROW AGAIN FROM THE GOVERNOR HIS LANGUAGE REGARDING A DIMMER. THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS TO. BE ON THE BOOKS FOR A LONGER AS WE WORK OUR WAY OUT OF THE RECESSION. AND FOR OTHERS FOR US TO CODIFY INTO PERMANENCE BECAUSE- THEY ARE AN IMPROVEMENT UPON THE WAY WE CURRENTLY DO BUSINESS. WITH THAT MY FINAL QUESTION WILL BE FOR YOU- TIA OR- AND YOU BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON IT BUT- I THINK. I WOULD. APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD. EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE LOW SINCE LEARNS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE LAST RECESSION. AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY THAT. DUE TO AVOID. AND THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YET HERE OR FROM THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I. WOULD THINK YOU BACK OFF OF THE COMMENTS THAT THAT MIGHT MAKE A MENTION ANYBODY HAVE UNIQUELY AND IN PARTNERSHIP COME UP WITH SOME VERY CREATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION SPACE. KINDER CAMP. AND THEY'RE DONE JUST FOR A MOMENT IN TIME AND SO I DETECT AGAIN TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID I MISTER CHAIR SOME OF THOSE THINGS THEY NEED TO BE REVISITED ARE AFRAID THAT IN SOME MADE MAY NEED TO BE REVISITED FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE IN PERPETUITY. ABOUT MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE WORK FORCE AND I WISH I HAD THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME WE SEEN IN TWO THOUSAND ANDEIGHT AND BEYOND THE TOTAL DISMANTLING UP OUR COUNTY FOR STRUCTURE WITH THE MASSIVE CONTRACTING OUT OF COUNTY SERVICES RIGHT AND THOSE. ARE PUBLIC SECTOR MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. IN COUNTY YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IT CAN MATCH. I SHRIEK ASH BUT AND THEN IT WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT THE REALITY AT THE REST. OF THE ALSO. HAVE DURING A- INCOME. ECONOMY SO I WOULD I WOULD HARD BE. PRESSED AND PUSHES. THINK OF WAYS. THAT WE BUILD OUR IN. TO TAKE CARE OF ARM ONE OF. THAT WE DON'T YOU KNOW FOR COUNTIES AND YOU. MASSIVELY AND FORCED THIS. YOU KNOW KIND OF NO NO WHEN DECISION WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT WORK TO. AND ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY A LIVING WAGE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THEIR WORKERS A LIVING WAGE UNTIL SOME OF THOSE- I THINK SOME OF THOSE DYNAMICS AND MISTER CHAIR UC. PHASE OUT THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT KIND OF RECOVERY. AND WE'VE NEVER RECOVERED SINCE THEN. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE STILL ISN'T BUILT IN A WAY THAT IT WAS PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND I THINK AGAIN. IT LENDS ITSELF TO WHY WE'RE HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME. BUILDING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPOND TO THIS. THEY MAKE THAT WE HAVE. ON RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO BE INCREASED ABOUT REVENUE OPTION. OF NOT HAVING A BUDGET THAT'S BASED ON AUSTERITY BUT HAPPY ONE THAT'S BASED ON. STRATEGY IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER. AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY GROW OUR SERVICE INDUSTRY AN INSURER WERE CREATING GOOD JOBS AND DELIVERING THE SERVICES THAT I KNOW OUR MOST VULNERABLE. YOU KNOW I'VE- SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC- ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM% THE COMMITTEE I DO WANT TO JUST. TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK. THIS PANEL FOR- IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND- WEIGHTY DISCUSSION WE DO HAVE OUR CHALLENGES SET BEFORE US. I WOULD LIKE NOW TO IF I CAN FOR US TO TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION IS FROM THE LINE OF THE TORNADO COMMENTS PLEASE GO AHEAD. FOR MR DAMAGE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HERNANDEZ GOMEZ YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO TO THE NUMBER GÃ³MEZ CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES SIR. OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT OKAY. HI MY NAME IS FOR NON THE GOMEZ I'M A CO FOUNDER OF DISABILITY BUSH'S UNITED AS WELL AS THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE WERE BOTH ORGANIZATIONS TO COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND PARENTS AND STUFF ADVOCATES LED. IN YOUR OUR SECOND PANEL. THE LAST PARAGRAPH OUR LEAD SENT IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH IS. WHAT MORE CAN THE STATE DUE TO RESPOND AS THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYED A CRISIS OF ECONOMIC RECESSION CONTINUE. I WANTED TO ADD ONE THE KEY THING IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE. IS ALREADY DOING AND THAT IS SUPPORTING. THE EFFORT. YOUR ADVOCATE ADDRESS DISPARITIES WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AS PARENTS WOULD BE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT CAN DIRECT DEPARTMENT SHE MENTIONED- PRESENTATION HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB AND WE JUST ASK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HARD TIMES IT COULD BE A LOT OF CHANGES. BUT WE JUST ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OURSELVES SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE INTERPRET ALLOCATE THIS DISPARITIES THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. REALLY APPRECIATE. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT QUESTION IS FROM THE LINE OF THE NIGHT CAROLINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL THEY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. CHECK YOUR HEARING TODAY I THINK IT'S TO COVER MANY IMPORTANT TOPICS AND THEMES FROM AND I GUESS I WANTED TO START OT THERE'S A BIKE JUST SAYING I KNOW THERE'S AN OLD ADAGE IN THE LAW. WHICH IS THAT- HARD CASES OFTEN RESULT IN BAD LAW. AND I THINK WE HAVE A SITUATION THAT WE FACE IN THE GREAT RECESSION WHERE GREAT RECESSION ENDED UP TRANSFORMING OFTEN INTO BAD POLICY. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE- NEXT WEEKS AND THEN MONTHS ABOUT THE DECISIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES MAKE. ABOUT HOW WE RESPOND. BECAUSE THE TWO THOUSAND NINE YOU KNOW WE MADE THE DECISION THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP WELFARE TO WORK AND HAVE FAMILY STAYING HOME FOR- FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THEY'RE FEDERAL TIME CLOCKS RAN- BUT- YOU KNOW THAT REALLY WELL. VERY THEY HAD A SHORT TIME CLOCK FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES AND THEN WE DID BRING THEM BACK IN WE UNDERFUNDED COUNTY THEY WERE UNDERSTAFFED THEY WEREN'T PREPARED. TO ENGAGE PEOPLE AND SO MANY TIMES FAMILY SPENT WEEKS MONTHS OF WAITING TO GET CHILDCARE OTHER SERVICES DID NOT. HAVE THE TIME CLOCK STOP THEM WHAT THEY GOT LEGAL SERVICES INTERVENTION. AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE IMPACT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE AND I THINK THE WITNESS THAT YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER TODAY. WAS A GOOD REMINDER THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY BIG CHALLENGES IN LIFE AND THAT THE NOTION THAT WE CAN GET EVERYONE AND CAL WORKS. THROUGH ALL PER WORKING FORTY EIGHT MONTHS IS JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. NOW I THINK. NOW WE'VE SEEN TWO MAJOR RECESSIONS IN BARELY OVER A DECADE WE NOW KNOW THAT. PANDEMICS AND RECESSION DON'T HAVE TIME ONE. BUT WE CONTINUE TO PUT TIME LIMITS ON PEOPLE FOR SNAP BENEFITS CAO WORK. FOR SHORT TERM BENEFITS AT THE CHURCH ACTORS PROVIDE SO WE CERTAINLY ARE MAJOR. FOR OUT TIME WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR IN TAKING A VERY IMPORTANT STEP OF SUSPENDING THE COWARDS FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK. BUT WE REALLY THINK THAT AS WE MOVE% FORWARDWE NEED TO CAN WE NEED TO KEEP UP SUSPENSION IN PLACE UNTIL THE ECONOMY REALLY GETS BACK ON ITS FEET. AND WE REALLY HAVE TO EXTEND OUT THE TIME LIMIT BACK TO THE FULL CADRE LIMIT TWO TO SIXTY MONTHS. I'M JUST A FEW OTHER VERY QUICK COMMENTS FOR YOU WON'T TAKE TOO LONG- WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY CENTURY MR MACULAR CAL GRANT SIR ABSOLUTELY FOR EACH. I WAS IN NO. OF ADDICTION COMING. IT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF INCOME THE FAMILY. SOME POCKETS WITH THESE WITH THESE. OBJECTION ORDERS GET LIFTED- THIS COULD LITERALLY IMPACT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO AN ADDITIONAL POINT WHICH IS THAT. ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES AND CAL WORKS THAT WE REALLY THINK WE NEED TO PRESERVE OUR THE HOUSING PROGRAMS THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE HOUSE- TO PORT PROGRAM FAMILY STABILIZATION ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA BE CRITICAL OVER THE NEXT FEW. THAT'S FAMILY AFTERTASTE BACKGROUNDS THEY HAVE TO THE CASE OF FICTIONAL ORDERS THERE'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON FAMILY CAN'T FRANKLY ON COUNTY. TO RESPOND TO THAT- WHICH IS WHY WE THINK THE ONGOING NATURE OF PERMANENT SOME PERMANENT. PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY MISTER MICHAELS AMENDMENT MADE CHEN OF IT. A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT EXTENDING OUT THE ORDERS ABOUT CUTTING PEOPLE OFF OF ASSISTANCE TO READ TO TERMINATION. AND CAR SEVEN WE THINK THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY NEEDS TO GET EXTENDED INTO THE FUTURE- SO THAT. COUNTY CAN REALLY FOCUS ON HELPING OUR CLIENTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY NEW PEOPLE COMING ON THE PROGRAM- AND THEN LASTLY I WILL JUST WENT WITH THIS THAT ONE THING THAT HAS NOT COME UP TODAY WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS. WE-HAVEN'T AT. I'M CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE BEING REQUIRED TO HAVE TO FILE. WITH THE IRS TAX RETURN IN ORDER TO GET THEIR CARES DOLLARS EACH CHECK THESE BENEFITS ARE COMING UP TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR EACH ADULT- THIS IS GOING TO BE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DRAW THIS MONEY DOWN THIS MONEY COULD BE ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING PEOPLE HOW. THIS MONEY CAN GO INTO OUR ECONOMY RIGHT AWAY- I'M HOPING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE MINISTRATION WILL BE COMING FOR PROPOSAL AT THE NAY REVISED. TO REDUCE OUTREACH LIKE WE DID WITH THE SSI- CALPERS EXPANSION. TO REALLY IN ALL PEOPLE SO I WOULD JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AS MY FINAL COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR.

THANK YOU THE NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT AT SOME CRISTINA HAS HAMILTON PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI HELLO- DR GRANULOMAS A COMMITTEE THIS IS CHRISTINA BONTA HAMILTON SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE U. D. W. REPRESENTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND I JUST AS PROVIDERS. IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES- THANK YOU FOR THIS REALLY IMPORTANT DIALOGUE- THIS IS A VERY LONG HEARING TO LISTEN TO BUT A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES HAVE COME UP. IN REGARDS TO IHS AS WE DO YOU WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A COUPLE OF ITEMS. FIRST OFF THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON JANUARY FIRST IS REALLY VITAL FOR AYE HFS WORKERS WHO LARGELY- MAKE JUST ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE AND FOR THE I JUST AS PROVIDERS WE REPRESENT IN IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES A LOT OF THE CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE NEGOTIATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- CONTAIN THESE WAGE SUPPLEMENTS WHERE THE INCREASE. ESSENTIALLY FLOATS ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE- SO WE NEED TO RETAIN THOSE WAGE SUPPLEMENTS WE NEED TO HAVE WE DID BE- GOING UP NEXT YEAR WE KNOW THAT THESE WORKERS ARE GENERALLY EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND BADLY WITHOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THEY WOULDN'T BE A GROWTH AT ALL AND IN A TIME WHEN. WE SHOULD BE REWARDING ESSENTIAL FRONTLINE STAFF LIKE I JUST THAT'S WORKERS WHO LITERALLY KEEP ELDERS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OUT OF NURSING HOMES OUT OF HOSPITALS WHICH IS WHERE THE LAST PLACE THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC WE NEED THE VALUE THAT WORK WE DON'T NEED TO UNDERVALUE OR CONTINUE UNDERVALUING AT- I ALSO WOULD CALL ATTENTION TO THEIR CONTINUE NEED FOR P. P. E. R. I IT JUST THAT'S WORKERS- THE GOVERNOR HAS- COMMITTED. TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. A FEW KEY. WE ARE FOR THAT BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE THAT IS LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHO CAN GO THROUGH THERE'S OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS IN GENERAL. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHEN WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE REFRESHED CONSTANTLY IS JUST THE FIRST STEP SO WE DO WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THAT AGAIN BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY BE A SYMPTOMATIC AND KEEP HE IS ONLY DESIGNATED. FOR WORKERS WHO ARE SERVING INFECTED CLIENTS OR CLIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO WHEN ATTENTION THAT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT ISSUE WHICH WE WERE GOING TO BRING TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- I JUST AS PROVIDERS TO SERVE THEIR CLIENTS. THEIR CHILD OR THEIR SPOUSES THEIR CLIENTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE UNDER STATE LAW FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE KNEW WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE COVERED IF THEY NEED TO UNDER THE NEW P. YOU EIGHTY HOWEVER. THAT IS A VERY LIMITED PROGRAM AND IT ONLY GOES. FIRST THE CIVIC UNEMPLOYMENT RELATING TO COOPERATE. THESE WORKERS 85% OF WHOM ARE WOMEN THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM STATEWIDE. THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT. ALL YEAR ROUND- MINUTE LEAVE BECAUSE WE SEE NOW HOW IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT ARE TO KEEP PEOPLE OF FLOW DURING THESE TYPE OF CRISES. AND FOR THE FOLKS WHO GENERALLY WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING TO THEM IT'S BECAUSE THEIR CHILD OR THEIR SPOUSE IS. HOSPITALIZED FOR AN EXTENDED TIME OR THEY PASSED AWAY THAT IS A COMPOUND THE TRAGEDY WHERE THEY'RE NOT ONLY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE BUT THERE NOW. CLEARLY FACING ECONOMIC DEVASTATION BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR PAYCHECK. THEY'VE LOST WHATEVER- BENEFIT WAS A- RECEIVED BY THE CLIENT AND THEN DON'T WE- DON'T EVEN HAVE THE SECURITY.

WHICH IS WHAT WITH PROPOSED JANUARY BUDGET THIS WILL REALLY JUST TO ENSURE THAT OUR AFFILIATES AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROVIDERS CAN RELY ON NEEDS.
