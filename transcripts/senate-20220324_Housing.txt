EIGHT NINE SEVEN ON THE PREVIOUS- EIGHTY LEGISLATION THAT I'VE WORKED ON AND OTHERS OF THE LOT PAST SIX YEARS. BY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE IN FOR EIGHTY NEW CONSTRUCTION. MUCH OF THE BILL INVOLVES FEEDBACK THAT MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED ALONG WITH THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOP OFFICES WE'VE HEARD THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE THERE TRY EITHER IN THE- FIELD TRYING TO BUILD. EDUS AND HOMEOWNERS AND- EXPLAIN. THAT THEY THAT THEY STILL FACE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A SUPPRESSION OF EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION AND MEETING OUR GOALS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. EIGHTY USE ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE PROPERTY AT THE END OF THE DAY. THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GENERALLY MORE AFFORDABLE RENTAL AVAILABILITY IN THE COMMUNITIES INCOME PROVIDE WEALTH BUILDING FOR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I FIRST STARTED OFF I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH. HOW THE WEALTH BUILDING CAN WORK ON. A LOT OF THOSE WHO THAT OPPORTUNITY JUST HAVE NOT OR JUST DO NOT EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY THEY PROVIDE THE HOUSING OPTION THE FLEXIBILITY. OF I'M LIVING IN THE EIGHTY YOU I'M LIVING IN THE HOUSE I WANT TO MOVE OUT I WANNA MOVE IN.

THANK YOU SECURE- IN IN I JUST WANNA RACE THREE POINTS- A BE. AN AYE VOTE ON BILL- YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY IS- MUCH A COURTESY IS ANYTHING TO GET IT OUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WOOD- WHAT THE AUTHOR IS DOING. A TO TRY TO MOVE THIS ALONG CERTAINLY- IN MY WORKING WITH LOCAL REGIONAL GOVERNMENT BEEN A HUGE ISSUE TO TRY TO GET SOME UNIFORMITY AND- SOME STREAMLINING GOING AND WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THE COOPERATION OF SOMETIMES OF OUR OWN PLANNING PROFESSIONALS- THAT SAID THERE'S THREE AREAS GOING FORWARD THERE ARE A I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK UP WITH- A LOT OF CONCERN IN IN I SEE THAT- CERTAINLY IF. THE AUTHOR WANTS TO RESPOND. BUT NOW WE'RE DURING HIS CLOTHES- SO WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR THAT'S THAT'S UP TO THE AUTHOR BUT- MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST WANT TO FLAG THESE THREE ISSUES FOR ME BECAUSE- IT COULD COME DOWN. THE TWO FOUR VOTE AT SOME POINT- I'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR ON THE RECORD- THAT IN IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS PREDOMINATELY- PARTICULAR THE EAST SIDE OF MY DISTRICT- THAT WE TYPICALLY USE. AN EIGHT HUNDRED FOOT THE QUARTER MILE PEDESTRIAN- LIMITATION IF YOU WILL OF. FOR A PARKING AROUND TRANSIT STOPS WERE WERE JUST PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY A TRANSIT STOPS- I THINK CENTER BECAUSE OF NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AREA IN THE TRANSIT AGENCY WORK BILL- TO BE WALKABLE- AT HELP AT HALF MILE DISTANCES TO BE SAFE A NUMBER OF LEVELS AT THOSE DISTANCES SO. OF MY CONSTITUENTS- HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT- SO YOU KNOW REDUCING THAT DOWN WOULD BE AN ISSUE SIMILARLY- ON THE HEIGHT. LIMITS WHICH I'M READING THE BILL AS A TWENTY FIVE FOOT BY RIGHT- WOULD REALLY FLY IN THE FACE OF COMMITMENTS I'VE MADE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN MY DISTRICT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SOME DISCRETION AROUND HEIGHTS INCLUDING THE RECENT SB NINE DISCUSSION WHICH I WAS WAS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT ABOVE ALSO HAD. TO WORK REALLY REALLY HARD YOU KNOW WITH FIFTY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MY JURISDICTION TO REASSURE THEM THAT- WE UNDERSTAND OR UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE- HI. HER LACK OF HEIGHT LIMITATIONS CANNOT JUST BE A BY RIGHT ISSUE SO I ENDED UP THERE SOMETHING MORE THAT CAN BE DONE WORKING ON THAT. IN THE LAST WEEK- CODE ISSUES AGAIN I WANT TO HARKEN BACK TO THE MOST REDLINED PORTION OF MY DISTRICT- WHICH WHICH EIGHT EIGHT I THINK AGAIN IF ANYBODY WANTS TO WRITE I THINK THE BE THE GREED THAT WE HAVE A VERY RED LINED UP THE SIDE OF OUR DISTRICT- IN THAT AREA WE HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IN IN A SORT OF THE ILLEGAL EIGHTY USE SEPARATE CONVERTED GARAGES AND SO FORTH I NOTED THAT- IN THE ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO HAVING. OF PERHAPS 8% HELLO NINE CODE COMPLIANT EIGHTY USE THAT ARE OUT THERE ESSENTIALLY ILLEGAL EIGHTY YEARS I WOULD. I WOULD. SUBMIT I DON'T HAVE THE DATA FOR THAT IN THE SIDE OF MY DISTRICT THE NUMBER IS FAR HIGHER THAN THAT. IN AN ADULT IN EIGHT I DON'T. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL SAYS- THAT THERE'S ONLY AMNESTY IF THERE'S NO HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE. WOULD BE PRESCRIBED TO BE- OR OR HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD INTERPRET THAT. HE I JUST THINK IT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT HERE TO PREVENT. FRANKLY SOME OF THE CONDITIONS WERE SEEN RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HABITABILITY IN TERMS OF. FIRE SAFETY IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW FOLKS SAID YOUR SORT OF PACKED THE AND- LIKE SARDINES INTO EXTRAORDINARY SMALL SPACES SO- THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT STUFF IN THIS BILL- SO I PAY HEED TO FOCUS ON THE THREE THINGS THAT. I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR SOME CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND- AND NOT HIGHLIGHT ALL THE ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW REALLY I THINK REALLY APPROPRIATELY CALLED OUT IN THE BILL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE% SO THANK YOU FOR. YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU FOR CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE SPACE- BUT- I'M TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF. WHAT I THINK IS FOR ME AND PERHAPS THE- SOME OF OUR CALL GOING TO BE THE CHAU. ISSUES WITH THE BILL THAT COULD PERHAPS TO BE WORKED OUT THANK YOU. RESEARCHER IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS AT LEAST HOPEFULLY. AND THAT'S IT YES MA'AM- YES PLEASE OKAY- HE SAID WITH REGARD TO THE HALF MILE THAT WAS PART OF- AB TEN SIXTY NINE THAT ALLOW PEOPLE THAT IF YOU LIVE WITHIN HALF MILE OF TRANSIT THEN YOU'D BE ELIGIBLE BY RIGHT TO BUILD AN EIGHTY YEAR IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE HALF MILE YOU COULDN'T SO THAT WAS SORT OF A STATE WIDE. IT COMPROMISE THAT WE TOOK SIX YEARS AGO- THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT OBJECTED TO THAT AT THE TIME AND I. I REPRESENT THE EAST SIDE WITH VARIOUS ALSO SO I REALIZE THAT ANY PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT MAY HAVE STRESS STRESS ON IT I KNOW I CAN FROM HE WERE TO GET FROM UNINCORPORATED AREAS JUST PEOPLE GO THROUGH BUT THAT'S WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE AN ABUNDANCE OF ITS BEING MADE BUT THAT WAS SORT OF THIS. LET'S MAKE IT AS AN EASY THING SO I'M NOT CHANGING THAT THAT'S ALREADY THIS STATE LAW ON THE HALF MILE RADIUS FROM FROM- TRANSIT- WITH REGARD TO THE HEIGHT LIMIT YOU KNOW I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIX YEARS AGO ON AB R. S. B. TEN SIXTY NINE AND I TOOK AN AMENDMENT. FROM THE DAY I STILL HAVE SIXTEEN FEET WITH THAT DISCUSSION AND WHAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT YOU NEED TO CRAWL SPACE. IN YOUR HOUSE THE IDEA IS THAT. IF THE C. WARD. FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING IS TWENTY TWO FEET. I'M FINE AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT FINANCE AND THIS YEAR WHAT THAT SWEET SPOT IS IF THE CITY ORDINANCES SAYING YOU CAN BILL TWENTY TWO FEET. AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT RIGHT- BUT SIXTEEN FEET IS SORT OF A TRICKSTER'S WAY OF SAYING THAT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE STORY. AND THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE A PERSON ON MY LEFT SIDE OF MY HOUSE TO MY RIGHT SAID HOUSE ALL HAVE TWO STORY BUILDINGS AND IF I WANT TO PUT A- EIGHTY WILL FOR MY GARAGE WHICH IS SMALLER THAN THE TWO STORY ADDITIONS. I TECHNICALLY COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'S OVER SIXTEEN FEET OR I WOULD HAVE TO TRANSMITTER PEOPLE WE'VE HAD REPORTS FROM EACH CITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRENCHING. JUST TO GET THE FOUNDATION IN AND SOME SORT OF PROOF BECAUSE- AGAIN I WAS. NO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MAGIC NUMBER IS BUT THAT'S WHAT THE IDEA IS I DON'T WANT IT TO BE. BIGGER AND BETTER THAN WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY HAS AND THAT IS. THE BIG COMPANIES THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT THAT HIGH LIMIT IS SO AND I'M OPEN AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT. IT'S UNKNOWN WHAT'S CINDY WAS FOR ME AS FAR AS THE CODE ENFORCEMENT AS FAR AS THE CODE ENFORCEMENT AS WE YOU KNOW WE GET YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THE BUILDING WE'RE WORKING WITH THE BUILDING OFFICIALS NO WE DON'T WANT. WHEN WE CHANGE THE DEFINITION FROM SECOND UNITS TO EIGHTY USE BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE REASON WHY SHE SAID ALL THE CITIES IN THE STATE PASSED SECOND UNIT ROB RIGHT WAS THAT SENATOR HE WAS IN THE SETTLEMENT OF TIME PASS A BILL SAID ALL THE CITIES HAVE TO DO A SECONDARY UNITS AND WHEN I GOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THERE WERE. LIKE FIVE SECONDARY UNITS THAT WERE BEING BUILT STATE IT WAS A IT WAS IT THE FACT AWAY TO HAVE NO MOTHER IN LAW UNITS BUILT LIST YOU'RE RICH YOU LIVED ON THE HILL AND WHO CARES IF YOU JUST THIS PAPER SO THIS WHOLE. TRYING TO BILLS IN THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN TO TRY TO TRY TO DO THAT SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE BOOTLEG UNITS AND AGAIN WE PUT HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THERE. BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS. FIVE PEOPLE LIVE IN A IN IN THE GARAGE AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT'S ILLEGAL THAT'S DONE. I'VE WE DON'T HAVE ANY TOLERANCE FOR THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A UNIT. THAT YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH. THE BUILDING PERMIT BUT YOU BUILD UP TO CODE AT THE TIME. AND IT'S CONTINUED TO BE HEALTHY IT'S NO DIFFERENT FROM THE MOTHER HOUSE IT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE BUILDING AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SIGN OFF ON THIS WE DON'T WANT. PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE DARKNESS AND NOT DO IT AND THAT. AND THAT PROVISION HAD A FIVE YEAR LIMITATION SO WE'VE LOST TWO YEARS WE- RIVER NOBODY HAS. THE CAN'T GET A BUILDING OFFICIAL OUT I'M BRAND NEW BUILDING IT'S HARD TO GET. OFFICIALS THERE SO WE SO WE'RE THINKING THAT THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S THE- PROBLEM THEY HAVE IT'S STILL GOING TO BE PROBLEMS DOING EDUCATION WITH FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL SCARED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS. ILLEGAL UNIT AND TRYING TO GIVE A CARE TO THE CITIES AND STATES. THAT HELPS ON YOUR RENEW THAT HELPS WITH YOUR LOW INCOME SO IF IT'S IF IT'S SMALLER AND HORRIBLE. THAT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE HOUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO WAS JUST SAYING. IF YOU'RE WITHIN HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TECHNICALLY. TODAY'S CODE DOESN'T MATCH UP TO WHEN YOU BUILT THIS- AND I DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE THIS I DON'T WANT PEOPLE DILLON ILLEGALLY COMING BACK FOR GRACE THAT'S NOT THE- THAT'S NOT THE RULE. I HOPE THAT HELPS. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRPERSON FOR MOST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CENTER I KASKY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- CINEMA CASKEY FACED INCREDIBLE HEADWINDS WHEN HE FIRST BROUGHT FORWARD- THE ISSUE ON A SAYS HER DWELLING UNITS AND THAT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. IN WE FAST FORWARD NOW TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SUCCESS THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS PASSED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. DID I. IN A SMART NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN WAY- WE CAN WAVE THE FLAG OF SUCCESS KNOWING THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS IN FACT- THERE HAVE BEEN THREE STUDIES IN THE STATE. THAT HAS SHOWN TO WIN SEVEN CALIFORNIA ONE IN- IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT SHOWS THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT. OF THESE EIGHTY TWO UNITS ARE AFFORDABLE TO FOLKS THAT ARE MAKING- AT OR BELOW A MONTH. WHICH IS TRULY. REMARKABLE AND THESE AREN'T EVEN DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS. THEIR EFFICIENCY UNITS AT THAT AT THE WORK FORCE CAN PROVIDE THE NEEDS OF THE TYPE OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SARAH CASKEY FREE LEADERSHIP AND ALSO KNOW THAT OTHER BEEN SEVERAS. OVER THE YEARS AND YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- AND PASS THEM. THE ISSUE IS AND WHY CASKEY HAD POINTED OUT WHERE THEY'RE- AT I'LL BE SPEAK FOR MYSELF CONTINUE CHALLENGES IS. GOING FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE FEET. APPRECIATE CINEMA KATHY'S COMMITMENT. AT TO BE ABLETO SIT DOWN AND IN WORK OBVIOUSLY WITH THE CHAIRWOMAN OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO OUR- PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT AS WELL. ON THAT ISSUE- BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD THING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A GOOD THING WITH EIGHTY USING ADIS- AND WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL AGREE. S. AND HER TEETH IT SAID AND MAKE SB NINE WILL BE THAT NEXT GAME CHANGER LEGISLATION. LOOKING AT NEIGHBORHOOD. DEVELOPMENT THAT IS S. AT SUMMIT SAID VERY ELOQUENT APPROACH. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT WE DON'T UPSET THAT APPLE CART. WE KEEP IT AT THE SIXTEEN FEET AND OR IF THE CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO BE ABLE TO. AT SAID THEY WANT TO GO BEYOND THAT THEN THE CITY COUNCIL CAN THEN- PASS THEIR OWN. OR NEEDS. TO BE ESSENTIALLY OPT INTO THAT. HAVE TO CONCERN IN REGARDS THE PARKING OF THAT WILL A- CONTINUE DISCUSSION. BUT IN PARTICULAR ON THE ISSUE OF THE TWENTY FIVE FEET. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE AND- NEXT FEW WEEKS AND GETTING. TO KNOW MY CASKET I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ESSENCE YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRED OUR COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR OTOBO. GOOD MORNING. SO I SHARE THE SAME OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS MY COLLEAGUES DO ON A DIET I ALSO WANTED FOR THE RECORD- WOULD YOU MIND- CERVIX SPENDING A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH REGARDS TO OR PUTTING ON THE RECORD. WITH REGARDS TO THE SECOND FLOOR EIGHTY USE AND- WITH THAT INCLUDE- PIECES OF OUR PROPERTIES THAT ARE SINGLE STORY IN ADDING AT AN EIGHTY YOU TO THE GARAGE. OR IS IT JUST FOR UNITS THAT. ALREADY HAVE TWO STORY- HOMES IN ADDING AN EIGHTY YOU TO THE TOP OF THE GARAGE WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OKAY IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE IT'S ALL THE ABOVE YOU WOULD GET. IT WOULD ALLOW SINGLE STORY HOUSES THAT. CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A SECOND FLOOR TO PUT AN EIGHTY YOU OVER THE GARAGE FOR INSTANCE AND WHICH SHOULD BE NEW CONSTRUCTION- THAT WOULD GO IN AND AS YOU'VE HEARD WE WANT A HARMONIZED AT WHAT WHAT THE CITY ORDINANCE ARE ON ON HIGH CLEMENTS TO- WHETHER IT'S AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT OF PROGRAM. IT IF THE IF THIS UNIT ALREADY HAS THE SECOND STORY AND THEY WANT TO BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE ATTACHED AND DETACHED IF IT ALREADY HAS THE SECOND STORY YOU CAN. CUT UP YOUR HOUSE. HOUSE PROBABLY NOT THE MOST ELEGANT THE CHANGE YOUR HOUSE SO THAT THAT SECOND STORY BECOMES TECHNICALLY A SECOND IT BECOMES AN EIGHTY YEAR THAT'S ALLOWABLE THAT'S ALLOWABLE NOW. UNDER UNDER THE LAW AND THIS WOULD ALLOW A BACKYARD COTTAGE IF THE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE OR SOME VARIATION COMMENT TO HAVE A SECOND UNIT THERE- I DON'T LIVE IN THE COMMUTER MAY I HAVE A COMMUTE A LITTLE BIT OF MY COMMUNITY HAS. DETACHED GARAGE FOR A LOT OF I KNOW LOS ANGELES HAS A LOT OF DETACHED GARAGES IN THE BACKYARD VERY POPULAR FOR PEOPLE COMMENDED JUST. GOT THEM AND THEN MAKE THEM INTO EIGHTY USE THIS WILL ALLOW THEM. AT A PRICE THE BILL THE SECOND THE BILL THE SECOND STORY AS LONG AS THEY- YOU KNOW THEY WE HAVE A- NEW IMPACT FEE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FEET SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT. THE HARDLINE. YOU KNOW I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO GO BIGGER YOU PAY YOU PAY SO IT WOULD BE- WITH THE LOOSENING IT WOULD IT WOULD. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT AFFECTED ON THE GROUND. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IS- WOULD YOU MIND EXPANDING OR EXPLAINING- TO OUR AUDIENCE. HOW THIS AFFECTS OUR DOES NOT AFFECT HOAS YEAH THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION I'VE HAD SOME FIGHTS WITH HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE DIFFERENT BILLS ON THIS BILL WE DON'T TOUCH THEM BECAUSE I THINK. THE HOMEOWNER WHO BUYS IN A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION SIGNED SIX CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS AND IF THOSE CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS SAY THAT YOU CAN'T BUILD. AN EIGHTY YEAR YOU CAN'T FILL THE SECOND FLOOR YOU WERE TO THAT. ALL THOSE OF US IN REGULAR SUBURBIA WERE. SITTING COUNTY SOMEWHERE- THEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE RESTRICTIONS AND THE CITY'S ALLOW THAT CONSTRUCTION THEN THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH. THAT BUT THIS THESE. S. B. EIGHT NINE SEVEN WOULD NOT CHANGE. AT ALL THE CONDITIONS WITH EIGHTY EIGHT- M. H. WAYS TO LIMIT OR PROHIBIT. EIGHTY YEARS FROM BEING CONSTRUCTED CONSTRUCTED IN THOSE AREAS IT JUST REMAINS THE SAME IT. THERE IS ANOTHER BILL I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN HAD THE BILL THAT INVITED EIGHTY EIGHT. H. WAYS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY WANT TO VOTE AS A BODY TO ALLOW THEM BUT THAT'S UP TO THEM. NOT THAT THE STATE AND THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT CHANGE THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER BATES. I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BEFORE THAT VARY ON DETAILED DESCRIPTION I WILL SAY I LIVE IN AN H. AWAY WITH QUITE LIMITED AND WE DID HAVE TO TRANSHIPPED TO GET A GARAGE BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL OKAY SO PEOPLE ARE MAKING OUT IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT- BUT IT IS CONCERNING WHEN MY ANALYSIS OF THAT THE CCN OURS. ARE FOR HOAS ARE OVER RULED AND IF THAT'S NOT ACCURATE I WANT THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE SENATOR- ARE PROTIUM AND ARE GOOD CHAIR HERE BOTH AGREED WHEN THEY HAVE THE ADDITIONAL THAT- CC IN OURS IN TERMS OF HOAS FOR ANY ADDITIONAL- MULTI FAMILY AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE SO I'M NOT SURE THAT MIGHT BE AN ERROR IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YOU ON THE RECORD SAYING THAT IS. IT'S AT LEAST COMFORTING BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY UNTIL WE SEE WHERE YOU GO WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES FOR THE RECORD KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THIS IS A LOT OF THE SAME AS- CONDITIONS AND- CABINETS AND THE H. AWAY AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S AN ERROR ON THE TRADING OUT FOR GARAGE WE DID AND WE GOT A FOUR CAR GARAGE WHICH ALLOWED US TO NOT VIOLATE THE PARKING RESTRICTIONS IN OUR H. AWAY AND LESSER THINGS I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPERS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BENDER STAND YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE COMMUNITY. REGULATION RULES I HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH PROVIDING COMMUNITIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AGGRAVATION AND LITIGATION AND HOAS AS YOU WELL KNOW ARE VERY SUBJECT TO THAT WHEN PEOPLE VIOLATE THE PARKING- WITH LARGE VANS AND BOATS YOU NAME IT SO NO ONE IN AND I HOPE THAT THAT THAT EVERY EIGHTY YOU FELT THAT I'VE HAD INCLUDING YEAH EIGHT NINE SEVEN INCREASES THAT PROTECTED THE RESPECT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HOAS AND PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT FORM A CHOICE. WITH THOSE RULES TRUMP BECAUSE THERE WE WHO STUDIES THAT YOU SIGN A CONTRACT IS A CONTRACT EITHER BY BY THESE. THESE RULES OF THE THAT THE AT THE REQUEST OF US IN. AN IN THE STATE OF. HAVE OUR CITY ORDINANCES THAT THAT RULE AND OF THE CITY ORDINANCE MY SIT OF FREMONT. AS A SEVEN FOOT. HIGH ON SINGLE FAMILY HOME. I KNOW KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S BUILT ON THIS TOUCH MORE BUT IT'S A BIG IT'S A BIG DEAL. SO I'M GONNA BE WORKING WITH. THE CHAIR OF HOUSING THE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT FINANCE THE FORMER CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT FINANCE AND- AND PROBABLY OTHER PEOPLE TO. TO RIGHT SIZE THIS THIS HYPHEN ABOUT WITH. REGARD TO. HOAS THAT'S NOT MY FIGHT OR NOT I'M NOT. I'M NOT IN THERE VERY GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. SENATE SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- SIDERITE COUNTY BRING THE BILL I WANT TO MAKE A CASE FOR- WHY. THE TWENTY FIVE HI BUT HI CAN BE APPROPRIATE AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PART OF OUR INTEREST IN EXPANDING THE ABILITY FOR HOMEOWNERS TO DO EIGHTY YEARS AND MAKING IT EASIER TO GET PERMITS IN FACT. IS TO THE AUTHOR HOUSING CRISIS BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS WE DO OFFER HOUSING CRISIS WE ARE ALSO TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STILL HAVE AMENITIES AND SUCH. AND DEPENDING ON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE YARD HAVING A NARROWER BUT HIGHER EDU COULD ALLOW FOR MORE. ROOM YOU KNOW YOUR GARDEN SPACE YARD SPACE RECREATIONAL SPACE FOR PLANTINGS YOU NAME IT. AND I THINK THERE'S A TO FOR US TO FEEL THAT WE HAVE TO ARBITRARILY AND I KNOW BARB THREE MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT WORD BUT- THAT WE WANT TO JUST KEEP EIGHT USE CONTACT. EIGHT EIGHT TWENTY FOOT TWENTY FIVE FOOT HIGH EIGHTY YOU COULD STILL BE VERY CONTACT IT COULD JUST BE AT A HIGHER PRICE. AND IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD- THE LOCKS IN THIS IS COMMON IN SOME OF OUR OLDER CITIES LIKE TURNER. AND ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS WANTED TO PUT IN A BEFORE WE HAD DONE BEFORE THE STATED DONE THE TYPES OF- YOU KNOW. GIVING THE GREEN LIGHT TO EIGHTY YEARS WANTED TO PUT A SECOND UNIT IN. AND WANTED IT TO BE. A TWO STORIES IN ORDER TO PRESERVE MORE AT THE YARD FOR THAT NOT ONLY THE NEW RESIDENTS AND NEED YOU BUT THE EXISTING RESIDENTS. AND VARIOUS NEIGHBORS FOUGHT ARE BASICALLY ARGUING YOU KNOW SHADE PROBLEMS BUT THEN ONCE THEY DID THE SHADE STUDY ONCE THEY PUT THE POLES OF EVERYTHING THEY FOUND THAT NO IT DIDN'T CREATE. IN FACT IT WOULD HAVE A BETTER YOU KNOW BETTER IMPACT ON THE DIFFERENT LOT AROUND IT AS A TWO STORY BEING NARROWER. NO MORE CONTENT THEN IF THEY THEN THE PLAN IF IT WERE YOU KNOW THE SQUARE FEET ALL IN ONE STORY. AND ANYWAY WAS JUST AN INTERESTING THIS WAS MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS JUST AN INTERESTING NO DEBATE THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND AND PEOPLE ASSERT IMPACTS. JUST BECAUSE WE ASSUME WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING SO I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE THAT WHILE YES MANY RESIDENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT PARKING. THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARKING HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE CANNOT BESIDES ALL OF OUR ZONING RESTRICTIONS OTHER ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND SUCH IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I SUPPORT THE BILL IF IT HASN'T. BEEN MOVED ALREADY ON THE- GREAT I THINK EVER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE EXCEPT CABALLERO GOING TO ONE TO SAY. SO MADAM CHAIR WHO'S GOING TO RECEIVE A AFTER THIS. SEVEN FOUR SEVEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEARING I WAS IN AND THAT THE COMMITTEE. BUT I JUST THAT THIS THIS- THIS BILL. I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CENTER RIGHT HOUSE KEY ON IT AND- IT WILL COME TO GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE. AFTERWARDS BUT AND SO- MY COMMENTS ARE JUST REALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCERNS I HAVE AND THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THE M. IN THE COMMITTEE IS THAT- I WHILE I AGREE WITH THAT WITH A SENATOR SKINNER SAID. SAID ABOUT IT CAN'T MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE OR DEPENDING ON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE IS. DOES IT. DOESN'T WORK IN A IN A AND EVERY COMMUNITY AND- AND I HAVE SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT TWO STORY. AND IF THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLOWING. MORE UNITS THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE UNITS WILL LOOK LIKE AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT. NEIGHBORS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND- SO I THINK THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN ALREADY. THROUGH THEIR ORDINANCE ALLOW. EIGHTY USED TO GO UP TO TWO STORY- AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A BILL THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW IT BY RIGHT AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M OUT OF THE PARKING AND ALL THAT IF YOU. I'M OKAY WITH BUT- BUT THE- IT'S A SAID IT'S THE TWO STORIES AND IN MANY COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE SITE VIEWS THAT ARE PROTECTED VIEW SHEDS THAT ARE PROTECTED THIS BECOMES A PROBLEM AS WELL. AND I'M- SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THIS IN IN IN THE SECOND COMMITTEE AND RIGHT NOW I'D I I'D LIKE TO- JUST INSANE IF YOU NEED TO VOTE TOGETHER. TO GET IT OUT I WON'T I WON'T STAND OUT ABOUT IN SUPPORT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT- THAT IT IS COMING TO SECOND COMMITTEE AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND- ARM WRESTLE OVER IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO. SO NO ACTING UNSPOKEN SO IF NO OTHER COMMENTS. SERVER MY VOICE- SO FIRST OF ALL- ASSEMBLY FORGET TO THIS BILL THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THAT HE CHOICE COLLISIONS GOES WELL BEYOND THE SPELL. I'VE BEEN FORCED TO PUT A TWO EXCLUSIONS IN MY BILLS BECAUSE WHAT I THINK OF THAT REFLECT POLITICS. AROUND HOAS I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE I DON'T THINK HOAS OR ANY COMMUNITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXEMPT ITSELF FROM STATE HOUSING LAW BY BYTES OF THROUGH A- PRIVATE CONTRACT IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN CONTRACTOR WAY OUT OF COMPLYING. WITH STATE HOUSING LAW BY PUTTING TOGETHER SINCE YOU SEE IN OUR DOCUMENTS. IT IS WHEN YOU LOOK WHAT HATE STATE HOUSING LAW DOES IT IS ABOUT. THROUGH THE- NEXT THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IT IS ABOUT- AND YOU'RE MOVING AWAY FROM EXCLUSION AND SEGREGATION. AND WE ALLOW HOAS TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES. THAT IS. THAT EXACERBATES SEGREGATION AND EXCLUSION. TO ME BUT THAT ISSUE IS REALLY NOT. SORRY BEFORE US TODAY I'M GOOD SOMEWHERE IN SOME WATER PLEASE. AND DOT I'M HOPING THAT AT SOME POINT- WE WILL- BE ABLE TO. TACKLE THAT ISSUE PUTTING THAT ASIDE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK-RESOURCES. THANK YOU MADAM ESTHER. ON THIS BILL I REALLY WANNA- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. PERSISTENTLY EVEN BEFORE I WAS A SENATOR ON OVER ONE YOUR FIRST EIGHTY YOU BILLS WHEN I WAS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN ADDED ADDED OUT OF WORKING WITH SOME SKINNER AND SOMEONE OR TENGAN SUMMER BLOOM- AND OTHERS AND I'M VERY VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR THAT WORK ON. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY VERY OPPOSED PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO USE AT ALL- AND NOW THAN PEOPLE THEY EMBRACE DATA USING SAID THE DON'T PASS ANY OTHER LAWS HAS LED US TO A TO USE. BUT THEN WE HAVE THESE CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS THAT UNDERMINE EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION LIKE PARKING LIKE SOME OF THE HEIGHT. RESTRICTIONS AND SO I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU COME FORWARD WITH THE BILL- TO TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM SOME OF THESE RESTRICTIONS. ON UNDERSTANDING THE BIG PICTURE HERE I UNDERSTAND I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD TO MY NEIGHBORS HAVE OPINIONS AS WELL WE ALL HAVE A ROOM AS OPINIONS WITH A NEIGHBOR WE ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS- BUT WE DO HAVE THIS MULTI MILLION HOME SHORTAGE. THAT IS THAT IS WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE C THAT IN TERMS OF THE COST OF HOUSING. WE SEE A SPIKE IN INFECTIONS OF LOW INCOME RENTERS. YOU KNOW LET'S LOOK AT THE LOW INCOME RENTERS WHO CONTINUED TO BECOME HOMELESS WAVE AFTER WAVE OF LOW INCOME RENTERS WHOSE OUR HOUSING. AND BECOME HOMELESS AND IF WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITH EIGHTY USE TO CREATE MORE HOUSING A MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE. AND IF WE HAVE A TWO STORY. EIGHTY YOU. TRANSLATE TO UNITS INSTEAD OF ONE- YEAH OR HAS MORE SPACE FOR A FAMILY THAT'S A GOOD THING AND SO WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HEIGHTS I'D CONSIDERED SUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T GO ABOVE WHATEVER THE SURROUNDING HEIGHT LIMIT IS IF. IF A CITY HAS A THIRTY FOOT. HEIGHT LIMIT FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. A FIVE HIGH FOOT HIGH LIMIT. FOR EIGHTY YOU STRIKES AS REASONABLE. THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ALREADY MADE THAT DETERMINATION- BUT DOT- I THINK WE WOULD LIKE FOR US TO DEAL WITH THAT ALL TOGETHER- AND THAT'S WHY I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION EGGMAN FINANCE. CENTER CABALLERO AND I WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY. TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY WE SERVE ON EACH OTHER'S COMMITTEES- AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION- AND MOVING. FORWARD A STRONG BILL SOME RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR SKINNER AND SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. I'LL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AS MY CLOTHES. IT HAS YOU AND I BOTH.

GOOD MORNING TO ADD THINK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE. AND MAKING SURE WE PRIORITIZE OUR SMALL RENTAL PROPERTY HOMEOWNERS IN THIS BILL. R. AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HOMEOWNERS WERE BEHIND ON THEIR MORTGAGES MANY OF THESE HOMEOWNERS ON REAL UP RENTAL PROPERTY. AND ONE FEDERAL MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE ENDS THEY MAY BE FORCED TO REMOVE THE RENTAL UNITS FROM THE MARKET AND SELL THEM IN ORDER TO AVOID FORECLOSURE. SB EIGHT FOUR SEVEN ESTABLISHES A GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO HOMEOWNERS APPLICANTS UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE RELIEF PROGRAM USES FEDERAL HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO HELP HOME OWNERS GET CAUGHT UP ON THEIR HOUSING PAYMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE RENTAL PROPERTIES. UP WE DO HAVE TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA OR BEHIND ON THEIR- ON THE RANCH BUT WE WILL NOT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WHAT THEY MAKE FALLS JUST ABOVE THE EXISTING THRESHOLD FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS LEAVES THE OWNERS OF THEIR RENTAL PROPERTY WHO SOMETIMES ARE STILL PAYING OFF THE MORTGAGE. ON THE PROPERTY STRUGGLING THEMSELVES SB EIGHT FOUR SEVEN CLOSES A GAP FOR TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE APPLIED AND BEEN REJECTED FROM STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IN TRINIDAD A RENTAL UNIT STAY IN THE MARKET AND PEOPLE DO NOT LOSE THE ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. I HAVE THREE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TODAY JOINING US IN THIS ROOM. THE FIRST WITNESS ANITA EARL SHE'S A SMALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER I HAVE MICHAEL HAGERTY- SMALL PROPERTY HOMEOWNER AS WELL. AND I ALSO HAVE A DEBRA CARLTON WHO IS WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU SENATOR- HER TADO NEEDED EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS CORRECT YESTERDAY GREAT- OKAY WE WILL START WITH- ARE YOU IN NEED A GIRLS I AM GREAT. WELCOME GOOD MORNING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. MY NAME'S ANITA IRWIN I OWN A HOME IN SACRAMENTO. CURRENTLY I'M LOSING MY HOME BECAUSE I HAD A PERSON LIVING IN THE HOME SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN RENT FREE. THE WELL MEANING PANDEMIC EVICTION GAVE HER PROTECTION. THE RESULT IS THAT SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE MYSELF HAVE BEEN FINANCIALLY RUINED WITHOUT A REMEDY. IF THE TENANT REFUSES TO COOPERATE. I APPLIED FOR THE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS AS REQUIRED BY THE STATE SHE DID NOT. WHEN I FINALLY HAVE MY HOME BACK. I FOUND THAT THE TENET HAD DID THAT DAMAGE IT BEYOND MY FINANCIAL ABILITY TO REPAIR IT. I FOUND ELECTRICAL RECEPTACLES AND SMOKE DETECTORS PULLED FROM THE WALLS. ALL CEILING FIXTURES WERE DESTROYED. ALL OF THE WALLS AND DOORS HAD HOLES IN THEM. THE HARDWOOD FLOORS HAD BEEN INTENTIONALLY LOCAL FROM BEING INTENTIONALLY FLOODED. MY DRIVER WAS MISSING STILL DESTROY DEBRIS ALL OVER THE PROPERTY INCLUDING TWO ABANDONED VEHICLES THAT RESULTED IN THE PROPERTY BEING CONDEMNED. AFTER SHE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE CITY. THE ESTIMATE TO REPAIR MY HOME IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR IT SO IT'LL HAVE TO BE SOLD AT A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS. ALL OF THIS BREAKS MY HEART BECAUSE THE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE MY GRANDMOTHER ALONG WITH MY MOTHER HER DAUGHTER. TRAVELED VIA GREYHOUND TO BUY THAT HOUSE AND IT'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY EVERY SENSE. LITTLE DID I KNOW IF WE I'M SORRY. THAT IT WOULD END LIKE THIS. LANDLORDS WERE ASKED NOT TO MAKE PEOPLE HOMELESS DURING A GLOBAL CRISES AND WE DID NOT WE'RE ASKING IN RETURN THAT WE NOT BE BANKRUPTED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T. SO TODAY MEMBERS I'M ASKING FOR YOUR I PULLED. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY- OKAY WILL NOW GO TO- MICHAEL HAGERTY. WHO IS ALSO HERE WITH US TODAY WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME MICHAEL HAGGERTY I LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK IN SENATOR MCGUIRE'S DISTRICT I'M RETIRED I OWN JUST ONE RENTAL UNIT. REFILL WHICH HELPS WITH MY RETIREMENT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THE PANDEMIC BEGAN MY TENANTS STOP PAYING ME RENT TO DATE HE OWES ME FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BACKGROUND. HE WAS DENIED FUNDING FROM THE RENT RELIEF PROGRAM BECAUSE HE MAKES TOO MUCH MONEY TENET IS AND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED. BECAUSE THE UNIT IS SITUATED ALAMEDA COUNTY LAW PROHIBITS ME AND ALL OWNERS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FROM EVICTING A TENANT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE CHEATING AND CLAIMING A COVERT HARDSHIP FOR REFUSING TO PAY THE RENT. BECAUSE THE GENERAL WAS DENIED RENTAL ASSISTANCE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING FROM THE STATE OR LOCAL RELIEF PROGRAM. I'VE HAD TO BORROW MONEY FROM MY IRA TO PAY THE MORTGAGE AND TAXES ON THE PROPERTY. I WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THIS PROPERTY OF MY TENANT IS ALLOWED TO LIVE RENT FREE. I WON'T BE ABLE TO SELL THE UNIT WITH THE TENANT IN PLACE AND THE POTENTIAL IS FORECLOSURE IF I CAN'T PAY THE MORTGAGE. BECAUSE STATE LAW ALLOWED TENANTS TO SELF CERTIFY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT TRUTHFUL MANY OWNERS IN THE STATE ARE FACING THE SAME SITUATION AS I AM. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO INVEST IN NEW HOUSING ALSO. AND I SUPPORT BILLS LIKE SENATOR WIENER'S HIGHER DENSITY PROPOSALS IN FACT I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL OP BEDS- IN SUPPORT OF YOUR EFFORTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WORE FLAT SO I'M A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE TODAY- WHEN I FEEL LIKE YOU I HAVE HERE YOU UNDERSTAND I DID REGISTER IN A FORMAL COMPLAINT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE LECTERN MUCH APPRECIATED ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING- MEMBERS I THANK OU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- MY BILL. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL I LOVE THIS BILL REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE BILL WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ONE THING TRAINING IS IMPORTANT. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. I WOULD FIRST TO THANK MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP AND WORK ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE I HAVE BEEN THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE AND MANUFACTURED HOMES. MY EIGHT YEAR. IN THAT POSITION I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FIRSTHAND MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT THESE COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MOBILE HOMES OR MANUFACTURED HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THREE POINT 8% OF TOTAL HOUSING STOCK AND EQUALING ROUGHLY ONE POINT MILLION ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. SENATOR WIENER. FOR PARKS WAS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE SPACES- US SENATOR BATES YOU HAVE SIXTY SIX PARKS WITH EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT. THE SENATOR CABALLERO YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PARKS WITH EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE SPACES. SENATOR CORTESE IS NOT HERE SAN REQUIRES NOT HERE ALL THE SENATE REQUIRED REQUIRED AS WHEN. HE HAS FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PARKS WITH 280-002-0013 SPACES. ZERO TOWBOAT HAS TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN PARKS WITH TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT. RESIDENTS CENTER SKINNER HAS TWENTY TWO PARKS WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED ANDSEVENTY ONE SPACES. AND CENTER RIGHT KELSEY YOU HAVE FIFTY TWO PARKS WITH SEVEN THOUSAND. NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY RESIDENTS I WAS ALWAYS LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEY HAVE. MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THEIR DISTRICT WE HAVE MEANT TOO MANY OF THEM. NEARLY HALF OF THESE HOMES ARE AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND SERVE AS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN OUR STATE THAT WE KNOW HAS A DEFINITE ONGOING NEED FOR HOUSING. THAT IS AFFORDABLE. MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE SENIORS. RELY ON EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE MOBILE HOME PARK TO ENSURE THAT THEIR HOUSING IS SAFE. AND MEETS APPROPRIATE QUALITY STANDARDS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS NO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TRAINING OR EDUCATION OF MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGERS. IN MANY INSTANCES THE PARK MANAGER MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY. OF OVER TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND SOMETIMES IN REMOTE LOCATIONS OF THE STATE. ONGOING VIOLATIONS. OF THE LAW THAT GENERALLY STEM FROM THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING BY PARK MANAGERS OF THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW WE COMMONLY REFER TO IT AS THE% BIBLE. AND THE COMPLEX OVERLY OF OTHER LAWS ANDREGULATIONS. THIS LACK OF TRAINING HAS LED TO SITUATIONS OF UNLAWFUL EVICTIONS. IMPROPER FEES. AND INVOICES DISCRIMINATION AND POOR MAINTENANCE WHICH GREATLY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE THE MOBILE HOME PARKS. WE ON TEAM LEYVA HAVE WITNESSED THINGS LIKE TYPHUS OUTBREAKS AND THAT WAS BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE MANAGER. DID NOT KNOW THAT THE. ONE HUNDRED FERAL CATS AT THE MOBILE HOME PARK HAD FLEAS AND THE POLICE COULD TRANSMIT TYPHUS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO TO CALL OR WHAT TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. SO THEY CALLED US TRAINING WOULD HAVE HELPED. SUPER SEWAGE OVERFLOWING AT THESE PARKS ON A REGULAR BASIS PARK MANAGERS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEY'VE CALLED OUR OFFICE. ELECTRICAL WIRES THAT ARE WRAPPED AROUND AND TAPED TO TREES AND BECAUSE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS TO ACTUALLY HAVE BURST OF ELECTRICITY AND BURN OUT ALL OF THEIR ELECTRIC. APPLIANCES AGAIN THE PARK MANAGER HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. ARE WE HAD ONE PLACE WHERE THE PARK MANAGER DID NOT KNOW THAT HE ACTUALLY HAD TO PROVIDE A SPACE FOR THE RESIDENTS TO HAVE THEIR MAIL DELIVERED BY THE POST PERSON. SO S. B. EIGHT SIXTY NINE. WOULD REQUIRE MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGERS TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED ON THE MOBILE HOME RULES AND REGULATIONS OF MANAGING A MOBILE HOME PARK. AND MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY ASKING FOR CERTIFICATION WE'RE NOT REQUIRING LICENSURE. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THESE MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGERS LICENSED. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT H. C. D. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE TRAINING AND OF FORCING THE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. OTHER STATES SUCH AS OREGON AND NEVADA ALREADY MANDATE SIMILAR TRAINING AND LICENSING IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN MOBILE HOME PARKS. AND IT IS CERTAINLY TIME FOR US TO FOLLOW SUIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS BRUCE STANTON WITH THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOME OWNERS LEAGUE MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND CENTER AYE AYE MAYBE I MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT BUT IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEES AMEND YOUR ACCEPTED THAT OKAY MY APOLOGIES NOT A WORRY- OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO AND DOES HE REMOTE. HIS REMOTE YES HIS CALLING OKAY SO- WILL NOT HEAR FROM MR STEP. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS BRUCE STANTON KHALKHAL CREEK YES- WELL IN SUPPORT OF CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN'T S. YOU SOMETHING ON THE FOUR LINES. THE MOBILE OF RESIDENCY LAW IS A WAY OF LOCAL CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE WHICH GOVERNS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OKLAHOMA RESIDENTS IN OUR MANAGEMENT EXISTING SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IF THEY EXPANDED DURING THE LAST FORTY YEARS TO INCLUDE OVER NINETY DETAILED SUBSECTIONS. COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF MOBILE OF HANNITY'S THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEES ARE ALL PUBLICATION WELL IT CAN'T THIRTY FOUR PAGES OF STATUTORY TAX AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAWS GOVERNING ALCOHOL PARKS IN BOTH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND TITLE TWENTY FIVE OF THE CODE OF REGULATIONS. THE LAWS ARE SPECIFIC THE MOBILE HOME PARKS IT DIFFER GREATLY FROM LAWS GOVERNING OTHER TYPES OF RENTAL HOUSING AND ANYONE REALLY PRESUMING TO COMPETENTLY MANAGE YOUR MOBILE HOME PARK. SHOULD BE WELL VERSED LAS. I UNLIKE PROPERTY MANAGE. FOR TWO RENTERS UNDERGO TRAINING OR LICENSING SURE THEY L. AND ACTORS YEAH EQT CLAUSE. OR THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY FOLLOW THEM SO AS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR PARK RESIDENTS. AB AVERAGE PARK DOES PROBABLY HAVE. OVER TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS WHERE MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY SO PARKS IT'S OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS. J. ONE HUNDRED HIGH OF COMPLAINTS OVER MANY YEARS BURKE PARK MANAGEMENT EITHER DOESN'T KNOW THE APPLICABLE LAWS THAT CARE. WHETHER THEY'RE FOLLOWER SIMPLY FLAUNTS THEM AND SOMEONE EDUCATED MANAGERS USE YOUR RELEVANT APARTMENT MARKET PROCEDURES. OTHERS PROFESS TO KNOW THE LAWS IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THEM. IN ONE CASE MANAGEMENT THAT IT LETTER TO THEIR RESIDENCE STATING QUOTE IF YOU CHOOSE TO NOT FOLLOW. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS WE WILL EFFECT DUMB **** OF QUOTES. THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT REALLY REFLECTS THE TOTAL LACK TRAINING IS A FEW SEVEN REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS. WE EXTENDED WAIVER FOR. OR ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU.

AND WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH A- SB EIGHT SIX NINE WMA RT HAS A TRAINING PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS MEMBERS AND NON MEMBERS ALIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED. THIS PROGRAM FOR OVER A DECADE. S. EIGHT SIX NINE IS TRYING BUILD AN ENTIRE TRAINING PROGRAM. BUILT ON DATA FROM AND OVER THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD PROGRAM TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO COMPLAIN TO THE STATE. AND THEN THE STATE TAKES ACTION. ON MARCH ELEVENTH OF THIS YEAR. HCV RELEASED THEIR ANNUAL EMERALD PP REPORT THAT CLEARLY SHOWS EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE ALREADY WORKING. AT OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS HCV PROCESSED LAST YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT COMPLAINTS OF THOSE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE WERE FOUND TO HAVE SOME SUBSTANCE AND OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY WERE REFERRED TO ANOTHER AGENCY DECIDES EIGHT CD. ONLY SEVENTEEN COMPLAINTS WERE REFERRED TO A LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER. THAT'S OUT OF THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF CASES FILED EACH CD WHICH IS ALREADY OVERWORKED UNDERSTAFFED IN BASED ON THE ISSUES SURROUNDING SEVENTEEN COMPLAINTS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. SHOULDN'T WE ENCOURAGE MORE HOUSING STOCK IN INCENTIVIZE MORE HOMEOWNERS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. HCB CURRENTLY HAS FEWER THAN FIFTY INSPECTORS STATEWIDE TO CONTROL FIFTY FOUR. FORTY FIVE HUNDRED MOBILE HOME PARKS. THE AUTHORS STATED CASES IN OREGON AND NEVADA THOSE EXAMPLES OREGON AND NEVADA REQUIRE FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING OVER TWO YEARS THIS BILL REQUIRES EIGHTEEN HOURS ON THE FIRST YEAR IN AN UNDISCLOSED NUMBER OF HOURS TO IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THAT'S TWO AND A HALF DAYS OF TRAINING. WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE THE PARTS WHEN THEY'RE OUT TRAINING. THIS BILL ONLY ALLOWS EACH CD THE OFFER THAT TRAINING. OREGON NEVADA ALLOWS THE REALTORS. THE MOBILE HOME PARK ASSOCIATION OR THE STATE TO OFFER THE TRAINING R. P. P. PROGRAM IS WORKING. WE ALSO NOTICED IN THIS BILL THAT A THIRD OF THE PARKS IN THE STATE AREN'T EVEN COVERED UNDER THE BILL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE UNDER FORTY UNITS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN ONSITE ONSITE PERSON. SO HAVE THESE REASONS AND OTHER REASONS LISTED IN OUR LETTER WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU'RE A MINUTE FIFTEEN NO PROBLEM MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TRANSMETA BE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE FOR MANY OTHER REASONS PUT FORWARD BY MY COLLEAGUE AT W.

AND SO YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE ONE PARTY UNHAPPY ONE NEIGHBOR COMPLAINS ABOUT THE OTHER NOT DOING SOMETHING YOU TAKE ACTION YOU'RE MAKING OUT ONE NEIGHBOR UNHAPPY M. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF DISPUTES THAT OFTEN ARISE AND LEAD TO COMPLAINTS THAT MAY BE THE MOBILE HOME SELECT COMMITTEE RECEIVED BUT AS YOU'VE HEARD BY FROM THE STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD. FROM EIGHT C. D. MOST OF THEM DO NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL- THAT THEY NEED ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND WE THINK THERE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS ON WARRANTED I NEEDED. THANK YOU.

SIX OF OUR REPORT AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF EIGHTEEN HOURS FOUR HOURS WHAT STATES DO THE TALK ABOUT THE TV NOW PROVIDES OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES JUST WITH THE BUSINESS TRANSACTION POR PART. BUT IT SUGGESTS THAT MOVING FORWARD YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MODELING PARTS OF THE TRAINING. OFFER THE OTHER STATES PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO STANDARDS AND ALL THAT SO MY QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU RUN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. IN YOUR A SITE MANAGER DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY HOURS OF TRAINING DAY TO AND WHAT'S THAT CONTINUING EDUCATION. THAT IS A GREAT SERVER RIGHT KELSEY I HAVE NO IDEA I'M THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE MANUFACTURED HOMES- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES- SO I DON'T KNOW OKAY JUST BECAUSE THEY SORT OF DO THE SAME THING OF MANAGE THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT. AREA OF LAW BUT SORT OF WHAT THE WHAT THE WORLD IS- THIS IDEA. WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE BANKRUPTCY LAWS YOU HAD TO DO COUNSELING A LOT OF SMALL INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE DID EDUCATION COUNSELING FINANCIAL COUNSELING THE WORK TO GET THEIR DISCHARGE IN BANKRUPTCY. THE COURTS ALLOWED PRIVATE ENTITIES- THERE'S A BATCH OF THEM THAT DO WITH THAT THAT. THEY SET THE STANDARDS IN IN THESE OTHER FOLKS DO IT. THIS BILL SAYS EVERYTHING'S IN HOUSE WITH EIGHT C. D. ALTHOUGH OTHER STATES DO THAT DO YOU SEE ANY BENEFIT OF ALLOWING. INDEPENDENT EDUCATION GROUPS TO DO THIS. TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION THERE COULD BE- WE CHOSE H. CD BECAUSE IT'S THIS IS A CALIFORNIA LAW THEY ARE THE ONES THAT- HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THE MOBILE HOME PARKS SO IT SEEMS THAT THEY WOULD BE THE ONES THAT KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. I WOULD BE THE RIGHT ENTITIES TO BE IN CHARGE OF THIS COULD A PRIVATE ENTITY DO IT. POSSIBLY I KNOW I'M ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT CREATING LITTLE COTTAGE INDUSTRIES WERE THEY MIGHT POP UP IN CHARGE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT- THEY MAY NOT BE- THEY MAY NOT BE IN TUNE TO WHAT HCD IS DOING EXACTLY. SO I THINK A CD IS THE APPROPRIATE ORGANIZATION OR DON'T I MEAN THEY THEY WOULD. SET THE STANDARDS AND WHAT THE HELL CANNOT BE BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE LANGUAGE ISSUE SOME PEOPLE ARE. PHYSICAL LEARNERS ARE VISUAL LEARNERS VERSUS SITTING ON THE COMPUTER THERE'S A WHOLE BATCH OF THE PEOPLE THAT THE WINTER SO BY. CREATING A COTTAGE INDUSTRY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO THAT YOU GET THAT CERTIFICATE THAT YOU WANT BUT YOU RESPOND TO. WHAT THAT MANAGER IS DOING SO THOSE ARE JUST MY COMMENTS I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. IN THE HOURS AND- POSITIONS YES. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER JOGO- I DO I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WITH FROM THE APARTMENT INDUSTRY. THAT COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION THE POSSIBLE- SURE WE- WE DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE BILL BUT IT IS A QUESTION I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT JUST SUPER COMPARISON. REPRESENTING YOUR QUESTION BASICALLY IS WHAT I'M TRYING I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION AS TO THE BALANCE OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS REQUIRED AS A REAL TORE WE HAVE- A NUMBER OF HOURS THAT WE HAVE TO YOU WERE MANDATED TO. TO HAVE CONTINUED EDUCATION AND I BELIEVE OURS IS FORTY FIVE HOURS OUT OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S SO WHEN I LOOKED AT WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THIS I THOUGHT EIGHTEEN HOURS FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN UNSPECIFIED. MONEY BORDER MAYBE A LITTLE- AN EASY BUT WE FOR YOUR PERSON ANSWERS LET ME JUST SAY THIS AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT APARTMENT COMPLEXES WERE TALKING ABOUT YES FOR A MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AS A REALTOR I BELIEVE YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE MORE TRAINING THAN A PARK MANAGER. OF PARK RANGERS ARE USUALLY CHOSEN LIKE THIS WHO WANTS TO VOLUNTEER OKAY I CHOOSE YOU SO THESE FOLKS DON'T HAVE ANY TRAINING SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE IT THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MISTER GOVERNOR- THAT IS BEEN WHY YOU WOULDN'T MAYBE NEED TO DO EIGHTEEN HOURS IN THE FIRST YEAR JUST LIKE BOB AND I WERE TALKING AFTER- AFTER- IS THAT- SESSION TODAY AND HE WAS SAYING THAT AS A WAR YOU'LL HAVE TO DO TWENTY FIVE WAS A LAWYER WHEN HE WENT TO SCHOOL FOR HOW MANY YEARS. SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF BACKGROUND YEAH THERE YOU GO PARK MANAGERS DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF A BACKGROUND SO THIS IS WHY WE THINK THAT HOURS AN HOUR AND A HALF A MONTH THEY HAVE TO DO IT OVER HERE IS NOT CUMBERSOME. AND THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL REAL REAL ESTATE RELATED YOU'RE ALL DEALING WITH WITH HOUSING WHETHER IT'S MANUFACTURED OR AN APARTMENT OR RESIDENTIAL- YOU KNOW FREESTANDING BUILDINGS IT'S ALL IN HOUSING AND THAT'S WHY I JUST WANTED A VERY DEAREST HOUSING BUT YEAH. YES BUT STILL HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN SO THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHERE I WAS TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ON DESERVE MORE SPECIFIC- CENTER TO A BOGUS ASKED FOR THOSE. OF YOU YOUR BRIEFLY RESPONDS- OUR- MISTER. MEMBERS RANKING. IRA SEVERAL. OF IN HAVE DONE SO FOR MANY YEARS. WHETHER THERE ARE. DECREASE PROPERTIES FOR. NORMAL PROPERTIES. IN ALL CASES- THE MANAGER. IF IT'S AN IN HOUSE MANAGER SIXTEEN UNITS OR MORE. MUST BE ONSITE. IN ALL CASES- THE MANAGER. HOW IF THEY'RE MANAGING PROPERTIES FOR SOMEONE ELSE. HOUSE TO FULFILL. A COUPLE PREREQUISITES WHEN THEY HAVE TO BE. HOLD A REAL ESTATE LICENSE. IN A REAL ESTATE LICENSE AS YOU POINT OUT SENATOR. HAS TO HAVE- CONTINUING EDUCATION. SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF TIME- ALL. MANAGERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELECT. FROM ALL SORTS OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. THOSE THIRTY PARTY PROVIDERS HAVE A SYLLABUS. THAT HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. AND APPROVED BY THEM. THEY HAVE A VERY RIGID SCHEDULE A VERY RIGID SET OF GUIDELINES. AND HAVE TO FOLLOW THOSE- AND IT COVERS THE WHOLE PANOPLY OF REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE SOME CASES. IN THE FORTY FIVE UNITS. THAT HAVE TO BE FULFILLED SOME OF THEM ARE OPTIONAL. SOME OF OUR MANDATORY FOR EXAMPLE FAIR HOUSING. THAT IS A MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO FULFILL. WHETHER IT'S THAT OR NOT BUT IN NO CASE CAN I THINK OF WHETHER- IT'S A- M. C. COURSE OF COURSE OFFERED- TO DENNIS DOCTORS WHATEVER IS IT REGULATED AND ONLY PROVIDED BY THE LICENSE SOAR. IT IS BY THIRD PARTIES. AND THE LICENSURE REGULATES THE ENTIRE PROGRAM SO IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT INDEED. OMF FROM THE MODEL THAT- YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS YOU OUT THAT. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE I'M SORRY CENTER THAT'S OKAY SO ONE LAST QUESTION HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE EIGHTEEN HOUR REQUIREMENT MANDATED AND- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW- JUST FOR THE RECORD WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO. THIRD PARTY AND LOOKING AT THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF HOURS WE THOUGHT THAT EIGHTEEN HOURS WOULD ENSURE THE PROPER TRAINING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE READ PERSONALLY ANY VIEW THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS THE LOGBOOK IT IS VERY LONG IT'S VERY COMPLEX- WE KNOW QUITE WELL ONE TEAM LEYVA AND SINCE LIKE I SAID I'VE BEEN THAT. CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR EIGHT YEARS SO WE THOUGHT EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN HOURS WAS THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO WORKING ON ANYTHING THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HEARING- THE BILL'S BEEN A PRINT FOR QUITE SOMETIME THIS IS THE FIRST I'M HEARING THAT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO. HELP PUT IN THE BILL ARE LOOKED AT IN THE BILL SO AS THE BILL CONTINUES ON WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO LOOK AT ANYTHING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. OKAY THREE NINE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. LONG STANDING WORK ON- ON MOBILE HOMES. AND I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT AS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS I KNOW YOU CONTINUED TO BOOKED UP WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES- TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE. A TRAINING PROGRAM- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE MOTION. MOTION BY CENTER LIKE CALCIUM CENTER LABOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU CENTER WIENER. SO I JUST ONE RESPONSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID- YES M. L. R. P. P. DOES HAVE A GREAT TRAINING PROGRAM IT'S NOT MANDATORY IT'S NOT REQUIRED. SO IF WE COULD MAKE THAT REQUIRED AND MAKE THAT MANDATORY THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED SO AGAIN YOU HAVE FOLKS. THAT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND YOU HAVE TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO. THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING REFERRED TO LEGAL SERVICE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT CAUSING PROBLEMS THIS BILL IS ABOUT PREVENTING PROBLEMS THINK ABOUT ANY TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU RECEIVE TRAINING. WHAT DID IT DO IT PROVIDED YOU WITH KNOWLEDGE SO YOU CAN BETTER CARRY OUT YOUR DUTIES. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR H. C. D. TO INSPECT THE PARKS WE ARE ASKING FOR TRAINING TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS HCD ALREADY DOESN'T FICTIONS OF MOBILE HOME PARKS. THIS BILL IS NOT REQUIRING ANY FURTHER INSPECTION. THE MANAGER IS THE REFEREE YOU MAKE ONE PERSON HAPPY AND ONE PERSON I'M HAPPY. SO AGAIN THE NEED FOR TRAINING SO IF I GO TO PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY VIEW OF THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION I DID DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR TWENTY YEARS BEFORE I CAME HERE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO TALK TO TWO PEOPLE AND SAY HEY. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE IF PARK MANAGERS DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THEN YES THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE ONE PERSON BATTLE ONE PERSON HAPPY BUT IF THEY HAVE THE TRAINING THE AT LEAST HAVE THE FACTS AND THEY CAN SAY TO THE BIT. IN THE DISPUTE THESE ARE THE FACTS YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THEM BUT THESE ARE THE FACTS IN THIS WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO. MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AS I START OFF SAYING I LOVE THIS BILL BECAUSE I KNOW AS A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN WOMAN. YOU ARE BETTER WHEN YOU WERE TRAINED AT ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THESE PUT MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGERS HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERNEATH THEM THAT ARE COUNTING ON THEM. TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT LEAST HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE ISSUES THAT FOLKS BRING UP. BUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE- SO WE CAN PUT. MOBILE PARK WHERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY NINE BY SENATOR LEYVA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY SENATOR WIENER.

AND YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER SHARON COLLEAGUES AT TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB NINE FOUR EIGHT THAT IS A BILL THAT WOULD HELP CUT THE COST FOR A HOUSING PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW THE PART OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES PROJECTS THEY HAVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACTS LIKE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS. SET ASIDE ENOUGH MONEY WHEN FINANCING THE PROJECT TO COVER A YEAR OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE TENANTS. THIS CALL TO TRANSITION RESERVE AND INTENDED TO PROVIDE A BUFFER. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT DEVELOPMENT LOSES ITS RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING. TRANSITION RESERVES RANGE FROM AS LOW AS A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN A SMALL PROJECT TO SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN A LARGE PROJECT. RESILIENT AS YOU ALL KNOW EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS THESE PROJECTS AND FUNDING IS REALLY SCARCE. H. U. D. RECENT COMMISSION A STUDY ON THE SUBJECT. AND THEY FOUND THAT THE USE OF THESE RESERVES WAS SO LOW. AS TO BECOME ALMOST AS TO BE ALMOST NON EXISTENT. TO AN ESSENCE THIS POLICY REQUIRES PROJECTS TO FULLY SELF INSURE FOR AN EVENT THAT IS REALISTICALLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. BASED ON ARE NOT BASED ON THEIR ANALYSIS. SO WITH THIS BILL WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO LIMIT THIS REQUIREMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS INSTEAD ALLOW IT SHE'S HCD TO CREATE A POLL RESERVE. LIKE INSURANCE FUND. THIS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE THE RARE OCCURRENCE WHEN RENTAL ASSISTANCE MIGHT BE LOST BOTH FREE UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

NINE SEVENTY ONE- BY SENATOR NEWMAN. SENATOR WELCOME IN MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SB NINE SEVENTY ONE WHICH WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME RENTERS WHO HAVE PETS. IN TODAY'S VERY CHALLENGING HOUSING MARKET TOO MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES FREQUENTLY FIND THEMSELVES FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN SECURING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND KEEPING. A CHERISHED PET EVERY YEAR A STAGGERING NUMBER OF OTHERWISE HEALTHY LOVING AND LOYAL FAMILY PETS ARE SURRENDERED TO CALIFORNIA'S ANIMAL SHELTERS. WHERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED REASONS FOR RELINQUISHING A PET IS BECAUSE OF A HOUSING MOVING FOR A LANDLORD ISSUE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THREE QUARTERS OF RENTERS ARE PET OWNERS HAD INCLUSION HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA REMAINS REMARKABLY SCARCE BETWEEN THE COMBINATION OF THE LACK OF PET FRIENDLY HOUSING OVERALL. AND EXPENSIVE OR RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS WITHIN AVAILABLE PROPERTIES IT IS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S WITH PATCH WERE MOST IMPACTED IN RECENT YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN IMPORTANT AND ENCOURAGING STEPS. IN RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT BOND BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THEIR PETS AS WELL AS THE NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS. TO HOUSING RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE FOR PET OWNERSHIP. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE BEST AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH REQUIRES HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. FINANCE FOR THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT. TO PERMIT A RESIDENT OF THE HOUSING GOING TO OWN ONE OR MORE COMMON HOUSEHOLD PETS. NOT WITHSTANDING THIS PROGRESS RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT PET POLICIES AND STATE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROPERTIES. CONTINUE TO LIMIT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES FOR MANY PET OWNERS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF RENTAL PROPERTIES APPLY STRICT LIMITATIONS AND BREED AND SIZE AND OR TYPICALLY CHARGE. EXPENSIVE MONTHLY FEES TO FAMILIES OR INDIVIDUALS WITH PETS. SB NINE SEVENTY ONE BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS LEGISLATION TO ALSO REQUIRE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FINANCED WITH LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TO BE PET FRIENDLY. THE BILL DIRECTS THESE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS THOSE FINANCED THROUGH DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT. FUNDING TO HAVE HAD INCLUSIVE POLICIES THAT ARE FREE FROM GREATER WEIGHT RESTRICTIONS AND TO NOT REQUIRE TENANTS. TO PAY MONTHLY PET FEES ON TOP OF REGULAR MONTHLY RENT AND SECURITY DEPOSITS. PEOPLE LIVING IN OR SEEKING AFFORDABLE RENTAL. HOUSING SHOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO A THE ANGUISH H. ENTRY RELATE A BILL PET SB NINETY SEVEN ONE WHICH- THAT MORE CAL. FAMILY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THEIR CANINE FELINE OR OTHER ANIMAL BEST FRIENDS ALONG AS PART OF ACCESS.

CALIFORNIA THEY PROVIDE EXCLUSIVELY NOTHING BUT- HOUSING FOR THE EXTREME LOW INCOME SENIORS AND- DISABLED. THEY HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE SENATOR SENATOR STAFF WE TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT- WE WILL GET THERE. EVERY HAT POLICY CONTRACT THAT EXISTS IN RENTAL HOUSING HAS SOME ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WHICH WERE ASKING THE SENATOR INCLUDE HE GRACIOUSLY. HI HAS AGREED TO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LANGUAGE ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANIMALS ARE AT LEAST- WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF TE PREMISES THAT THEY DON'T. DISTURB THE QUIET ENJOYMENT. FOR OTHER TENANTS SO THE TENANT LEAVES LEAVES AND THE DOG IS LEFT IN THE PREMISES AND IT HOWLS ALL DAY LONG. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS THAT TYPE THING COMMISSION OF WASTE AND CLEAN UP. THE WE'VE ASKED THE CENTRE TO INCLUDE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE IS A RESPONSIBLE TENET HAVING THE PAT I TO CLEAN UP AFTER THEIR PETS AS THE CASE MAY BE SO THESE ARE VERY PRACTICAL AMENDMENTS THAT THE- THE SENATOR IS GENERALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US AND WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION HERE IN THE ROOM. SEEING NOW WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES COULD YOU UP ANY OPPOSITION. TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE SEVEN ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. ONE FOLLOWED BY EUROPE THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR NOBODY IS GOING UP OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- IS THERE ANY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER SKINNER. I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE- I THINK CERTAINLY. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHO HAS A DOG THAT MIGHT HELP ALL DAY LONG HOWEVER I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY. HOMEOWNERS FOR WHOM THEIR DOGS HOWL ALL DAY LONG AND SO YOU COULD BE A NEIGHBOR. OF THAT PERSON AND HAVE A- DOG HELPING HOLD THE LONG SO I GUESS. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT WHILE. WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE ALL OCCUPANTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE PET OWNERS WE IS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WHETHER ONE IS A HOMEOWNER OR TENANT AND SO I GUESS. TO ME THE THEN THE PRINCIPAL COMES DO WE LIMIT. PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME AND LIVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM YOU KNOW BEING PET OWNERS AND- WHILE AT THE CURRENT TIME I AM NOT A DOG OWNER AND PARTLY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I'M HERE I'D HAVE TO MY POOR DOG WOULD I KNOW I'M HAPPY TIME HEARING HALFTIME. SO YOU KNOW I WOULD BE AN IRRESPONSIBLE PET OWNER FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IF I WERE A DOG OWNER FACT. THAT SAID. I THINK THE- WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO. IS GIVE YOU SAID THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ONCE INCOME THAT DETERMINES- WHETHER YOU CAN BE THAT PET OWNER OR NOT- WELL AGAIN. I'D LOVE TO SEE SOME KINDS OF- YOU KNOW MEDIATIONS OR SOMETHING UP THERE THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY RESTRICTIONS. JUST DUE TO AND I KNOW YOU'RE JUST GIVING ONE ARE OPPOSITION WAS JUST GIVING ONE EXAMPLE AND I DON'T NEED TO. TO YOU KNOW BUT BLOW IT OUT OF PROPORTION BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT HEY. PEOPLE ARE SUBJECTED TO THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECTED TO REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. OR THE STATUS OF THE PERSON NEXT DOOR ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM SO. ON THE BILL. YOUR COMMENTS TEAM NINE- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR SKINNER AND I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE- CENTER NEWMAN YOU MAY CLOSE- DAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM I'M ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED CENTER WORKERS GONNA HAD A LONG CONVERSATION. ABOUT HAD BILLS- AND I WAS FULLY PREPARED TO OFFER AS AN INDUCEMENT THE PROMISE OF A PUPPY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY- BUT NOW I THINK I'LL GIVE IT TO SENATOR SKINNER INSTEAD. AB SO THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM- AND WE CAN MAKE LIGHT OF IT BUT TO SENATOR SKINNER'S POINT ALSO THAT MISTER JACKSON IS ACTUALLY CHARACTERIZED. OUR CONVERSATIONS- THE OWNERSHIP OF A PATCH OF BE A PRO IN- FOR. AN OUT TO ACCESSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT- STEPS. RENTAL HOUSING- EVERY TENANT HAS THE SAME OBLIGATION TO YOU KNOW TO THE PRESERVATION OF QUIET ENJOYMENT OF A PROPERTY AND I THINK. PET OWNERS. SHOULD AND WILL BE HELD TO THAT STANDARD UNDER THIS LEGISLATION- GLAD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BOTH WITH- MISTER KINKS AND ALSO THE APARTMENT. WITH THAT I RESPECT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER SKINNER WILL CALL THE ROLL. THE SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY ONE BY SENATOR NEWMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE BATES. CABALLERO CORTESE HI FOR TEDDY I MCGUIRE. PHOTOBOOK I BUT TROUBLED AYE SKINNER. SKINNER I AM BURKE WITH CASKEY NOT VOTING. FOUR ZERO. IT IS CURRENTLY FOUR ZERO WILL PUT ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. WHEN IT WAS SENATE DOC IN THE BACKGROUND ON THE VICTOR- WAS THE DUCK ON A ON A LEASH. YOUR FAMILY LIKES YOUR BILL- OKAY THE YOU CENTER. WE WILL NOW GO TO THE- FIVE S. B. ELEVEN OH FIVE BY SENATOR HUESO SENATE HUESO YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHUCK CHAIRMAN- MEMBERS- I'M VERY PROUD OF PERCENT. S. B. ELEVEN OH FIVE A BILL THAT WOULD ESTABLISH TO SEND YOU ORIGINAL EQUITABLE. AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HOUSING AGENCY. WROTE SAN DIEGO IN ORDER TO TACKLE THE- HOUSING SHORTAGES IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS SPECIFIC TO SEND YOU A COUNTY. THAT IS SPECIFIC TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN- VERY IMPORTANT I'M PLANNING. THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT THE COUNTY. SANDAG AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF OUR ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE- STATE THERE ARE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ASSOCIATION GOVERNMENTS IN SAN DIEGO. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH A CONGLOMERATION. OF DIFFERENT CITIES. FROM THAT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THEY'VE BEEN IN CHARGE OF- THE TRANSPORTATION OF PLANNING- IN- IN RESOLVING DISPUTES AMONG BORDERS BETWEEN. CITIES AND HELPING TO MAINTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES- ASSOCIATE WITH THE COAST. AND ALL ALL SORTS OF PLANNING ISSUES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAD SOME ROLE. IN A PLAN IN HOUSING THEY HAVEN'T REALLY HAD- DIRECT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THAT HOUSING IS BUILT. CALIFORNIA A IN IN TOTALITY HAS GENERALLY FAILED TO MEET- IT'S- ANNUAL HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS AND FOR THAT REASON WERE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE- LEAST AFFORDABLE STATES TO LIVE IN AND HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS BEEN LACKING IN WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE ALL OF YOU THAT SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF THOSE ISSUES FACING A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND UNITS. AND- THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER NINETY THOUSAND THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BUILD BY TWENTY THIRTY SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME VERY DAUNTING GOALS IN THE NEXT DECADE TO MEET. AND OF THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY TOGETHER WITH VARIOUS LEADERS OF COME TOGETHER AND- THOUGHT HOW HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THIS WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET A BETTER JOB OF FINDING THIS AND ONE OF THE STRUGGLES IS NOT ONLY GONNA BE TO PRODUCES BUT HOW CAN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ABSORB THAT MANY UNITS IN A WAY. THAT'S GONNA BE FRIENDLY ON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S GOING TO BE FRIENDLY TO WORKERS TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS- CAN LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK- TO ENSURE THAT- THE HOUSING IS BUILT IN THE BEST LOCATIONS- IN- IN- REGARDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN A CITY DOES THAT THEY DO IT WITHIN THEIR OWN BOUNDARIES. BUT IN A COUNTY LIKE SAN DIEGO THAT IS- SO BIG AND SO DIVERSE ONE OF THE N. STREET SEE INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT SAN DIEGO'S THAT HAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF MOM AND POP FARMS. AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND SAN DIEGO TO PROTECT THOSE FARMS IN THAT PRODUCTION AND THAT LAND USE FROM ENCROACHMENT OF HOUSING. AND IT BECOMES HARDER IN SAN DIEGO WHEN YOU HAVE COMPETING GOALS LIKE THAT. AND SO- THIS BILL- I THINK WOULD BE A GREAT- SOLUTION TO HAVE SANDAG BE INVOLVED IN. THE FUTURE VISION IN AND THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY WORK CLOSER WITH CITIES. TO IDENTIFY. WHERE THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE INVESTED TO GET REALLY THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK TO ENSURE. THAT HOUSING INCREASE IS CREATE IT WHERE IT'S NEEDED SO WE DON'T PUT AN OVER BURDENED ON TRANSPORTATION. SO OF THIS BILL IS YOU'VE SEEN IT'S QUITE A LENGTHY BILL. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE LENGTHY PROCESS THIS BILL HAS UNDERGONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO COME UP WITH THIS POLICY THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING THIS THROUGH THIS- PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS BILL RIGHT THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT ALREADY A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WORK. HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL AND I ASK OF THE COMMITTEE BYE I THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR VERY THOROUGH. ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. AND I ASKED FOR YOU TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I KNOW WE HAVE- A CHAMPION OF THIS BILL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SERVICE SUPERVISOR TERREL LAWSON REAMER. THERE'S BEEN CHAT CHAMPION IN THIS ISSUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SHE'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. I BRING IN A TOGETHER OF VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE INTERPRETANT TO THIS PROCESS OF COURSE AS IT GOES THROUGH THIS PROCESS THROUGH LEGISLATION. THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND I AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT PROCESS MISTER CHAIR. AND I I'M SURE THAT- SUPERVISOR LOS RUMORES ONLINE TOO HI SO MORE TO THIS DISCUSSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER HUESO. WE WILL NOW GO TO- I BELIEVE- SUPERVISOR LAWSON MEMORIES ON THE LINE AS OUR MAIN- SUPPORT WINDOWS SO. WILL NOW HEAR. FROM THE SUPERVISOR. THANK YOU KAREN WEINER AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I CENTER WHERE THEM INTO WE HAVE A- HOUSE SHORTFALL IN SANDY COUNTY. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'RE STILL ONLY BUILDING ENOUGH TO MEET ABOUT 13% OF THE NEED AMONG WORKING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. ADD WHEN I TALK TO LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS SAN DIEGO I THINK IT'S PRETTY. BROADLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MEET THE SHORTFALL GIVEN OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES AND ARE FRAGMENTED HOUSING APPROACH. WE NEED A REGIONAL STRATEGY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. AND THE- SB REEF- IDEAS COME UP REPEATEDLY IN MY CONVERSATIONS THIS IS AT THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL EQUITABLE. AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FRIENDLY HOUSING AGENCY. AS A SOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY MANY STAKEHOLDERS WITH AND CONSTITUENTS IMPACTED. INDIVIDUALS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS- SB RE IS ALLEGED TEND TO STARTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACT IN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HOUSING. THE INTENT EAGLE COUNTY WHICH IS ONE REASON I CREATED AND NOW CHAIR SANDBAGS REGEL AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUB COMMITTEE I TO FORMALISE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND REFINING THAT HE REFER TO POSTAL. I'M ARE EQUITABLE HOUSING SUB COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH SUBREGIONAL REPRESENTATION AND WE'VE CONVENED A TASK FORCE OF FORTY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS IN PERSPECTIVE TO INFORM AND GUIDE OUR PROCESS IS WE FINALIZED THE PROPOSAL. THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE GROUPS I THINK SUCH AS SAN DIEGO HOUSING FEDERATION SAN DIEGO BUILDING TRADES AND THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. I SHOULD KNOW THAT OUR APPROACH- YES YOU READ AND IS NOT IDENTICAL TO THE PROCESS IN THE BAY AREA OR LOS ANGELES- WE HAVE WORKED HARD WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A SET OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES. THAT ARE LOCALLY ROOTED AND REFLECT THE VALUES IN REVISION OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY REGION. THESE INCLUDE AFFORDABILITY SUSTAINABILITY LIVABILITY EQUITY AND QUALITY JOBS. SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING THE SPELL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH CENTER AWAY SO ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY REGION. AND ALL OF YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL NOW GO TO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SUPPORTED PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM.

IN GENERAL WE DO LIKE THE IDEA OF A REGIONAL ENTITY THAT'S A GOOD THING- BUT AS WE CONSISTENTLY EXPRESSES COMMITTEE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SKILLED AND TRAINED PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY REDUCING THE COMPETITION AMONG AND THE CONTRACTOR SPACE WE HAVE A HARD TIME NOW HAVE A GETTING MORE THAN. ONE OR TWO APPLICANTS TO BID A CONSTRUCTION JOB IN A PREVAILING WAGE JOB AND IF WE REDUCE THAT POOL BY MORE THAN HALF IT WILL BE HERE DON'T BE A LOT OF MARKET POWER AMONG THE CONTRACTORS AND INCREASE THE COST SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS GOING FORWARD.

CENTER LOCALES AND THEN CENTER CORTEZ I'M FOR OF US LIVE IN THE BEAR SO WHY THIS ISN'T AN EXACT COPY. OF CHOOSE BILL AND IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AND THERE. ARE I'M GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY- BUT- A BAG HAS EXISTED AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN ALIVE I THINK IN THE IN THE BAY AREA AND IT WAS A REGIONAL PLANNING- AGENCY THAT WAS MERGED WITH MTC SO WE HAD THIS. IS WEIRD THING WORK RATHER THAN DO A J. P. WE DID THE SPECIAL LEGISLATION TO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. YOU KNOW. NEIGHBORS FIGHT ALL THE TIME AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE IN CITIES REALLY FIGHT OVER. THIS PROJECT AND THAT PROJECT SO. THIS IS. AS THE OPPOSITION HAS INDICATES ONLY SEVEN DAYS OLD HERE SO HARD TO GET IT TO US WELL GET IN BUT IT'S A- I'M GOING TO GIVE YOUR MY COLLEAGUE I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE VOTE TODAY UT- BUT THERE IS- YOU KNOW DECADES OF WORK THAT THE BAY AREA DID. IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT LEVEL AND I'D LIKE TO SEE SAN DIEGO. ACHIEVE THAT BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF GROUND WORK THAT HAD TO GET DONE BEFORE WE GOT TO THE- END OF A- ABOUT FIVE SO. THAT'S JUST MY COMMENT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION OF CENTER THAT'S IN MY CALL YEAH THANK YOU SURE BE-BRIEF- JUST WANT TO- COMMITTEE AUTHOR BRINGS FORWARD A- A SUSHI MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF CENTER WORKOUTS SKI ON THE- THE MODEL IN THE BAYAREA I WAS. THERE WORKING ON THAT- WHEN SOME MEMBER CHU WAS BRING THAT LEGISLATION FORTY. WORK REALLY REALLY CLOSELY WITH REGIONAL FOLKS TO THE- YOU KNOW TO ESSENTIALLY AMEND THAT BILL ALONG THE WAY TO MAKE SURE WORK FOR EVERYBODY I'M SURE YOU'LL DO THE SAME THING WITH SAN DIEGO. ON THE SKILLED AND TRAINED ISSUE- A WANTED TO AFFIRM YOU ON THAT IS WELL IN. ME IS KIND OF HEARTBREAKING FOR ME TO HEAR OF FOLKS WERE BUILDING. HOUSING FOR POOR PEOPLE. A TALK ABOUT NOT PAYING. POOR PEOPLE ENOUGH MONEY TO FOR THE HOUSING THAT THEY NEED TO MOVE INTO AN- AS A FORMER BUILDER MYSELF I DON'T BUY INTO THE FACT THAT. A YOU CAN'T ENTER PEOPLE IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS YOU KNOW WITHOUT BANKRUPTING. JESSICA I DONE IT THE BILL WITH IMAGES YOU STICK TO YOUR GUNS- YOU KNOW ON THAT ISSUE AS WELL SO. HAPPY TO CONTINUE. SUPPORTING THE BILL ON THE WAY THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL. OR COME CENTER. OF JUST WANT TO COME RELEASED. AND SAYS SOMETHING. TO THIS LAST YEAR WHICHWAS BROUGHT FORTH WITH SENATORS COME LOCKER. HOWEVER I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM LOCAL- ENTITIES ON ON THAT AND SOME ON THAT FRONT I'M GOING TO STAY OFF. THE STRONG I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK- WITH SPECIALLY. AS I SAY YOU KNOW ONE STATE. ONE ONE SIZE FITS DOESN'T AT ALL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M VERY VERY LEERY TO. SUPPORT BILLS- THAT OUR REGIONAL- WITHOUT HEARING FROM MANY OF THE LOCAL- ELECTED ON THAT FRONT SO I'M I'M GOING TO STAY- I'M NO VOTING FOR THIS ONE SELF CARE PALLETIZING. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SEEING NONE- SENATE HUESO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS NOTED THIS IS A NEARLY- THE BILL NEWLY PUT IN PRINT I PRESENT YOU WORKING WITH ERIC- COMMITTEE ON A AND- I TOO WAS- WHEN WE DO THIS FOR THE BAY AREA. I REMEMBER- WHEN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND- SENATOR MCGUIRE TO ONE OF HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IN MARIN COUNTY TO MEET WITH THEM TO SEE BOARD MEMBERS AND WORKED WITH. IT WAS A VERY VERY EXHAUSTIVE- PROCESS AND SO- I KNOW THAT YOU'LL DO THAT WORK IN ENGAGING LOCAL. I STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS BILL WILL BE A WORK IN PROGRESS- THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE IS IN TERMS OF THE- SPEND THE JURORS AND THE TYPES OF. HOUSING AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THAT OF COURSE THE GOVERNANCE PROVISION. WILL BE HANDLED BY THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE- COMMITTEE- SO- I DO. RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE- TODAY AND I CAN HAVE SOMEONE OF THE BILL ALREADY I DON'T THINK SO OKAY CENTER COULD HAS REMOVED THE BILL AND YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF SUPPORT INNER AND THE COMMENTS OF CONCERN- JUST A NOTE- THAT YOU BILL IN THE- OF A REAL DEFINITELY- MODELS FOR THIS PHYLLIS WELLS. THEY A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THAT BILL- OR THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WAS IN THAT BILL WAS R. AS IN THIS BILL SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY. YOU SHOULD HAVE CONCERNS AND SUPPORT ESPECIALLY EARLY ON IN THIS PROCESS. YOU KNOW A- GREAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE IT'S- IT'S A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND- WE HAVE ENGAGED ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. LABOR LOCAL GROUPS- THE SAN DIEGO FOUNDATION A OR P. THE NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE ASSOCIATION BIO COM SEMPRA. MAC PROJECT B. I. A. EVERYBODY IS SITTING AT THE TABLE TO THIS PROCESS AND- THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING OVERWHELMING AT. OPPOSITION SPEAKS THAT TO. OF PEOPLE WILLING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO ENVISION. A BILL THAT IS RIGHT FOR SAN DIEGO AND AS I MENTIONED SAN DIEGO IS. A VERY UNIQUE COUNTY AND THERE ARE MANY VERY UNIQUE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE REALLY ISN'T A ONE SIZE FITS APPROACH AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL DOESN'T REMOVE ANY- HOUSING AUTHORITY RESPONSIBILITIES IF THEY ALREADY CREATED AND SEND YOU WHAT'S THERE SOME AND I'VE SERVED ON ON THOSE. AND THEY JONES- TAKE AWAY ANY RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS SO THIS IS NOT A FIGHT. BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND SANDAG AND LOCAL CITIES THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE ADDITIONAL PLANNING GIVING THEM RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENVISION WHERE WHEN AND HOW THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO MAKE THE MADE IN THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION. THAT'S NOT ONLY GOING TO BE TASK PLANNING AND MAKING REPORTS AND HAVING BALLOT INITIATIVES BUT- TO DRAW FROM MONEY DOWN FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MAYBE THE LOCAL LEVEL OR ANY WHICH WAY THEY CAN AT. BECAUSE WITHOUT THESE FUNDS A HOUSING CAN BE BUILT. IT'S THAT PLAIN AND SIMPLE. WE NEED THESE FUNDS WE NEED THIS THIS HOUSING AND ADDING AN AGENCY THAT'S WILLING TO DO THIS WITH THE- I MEAN. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO BE SITTING. ON THE CHAIR MAKING THE DECISION SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S A PART OF THIS BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR DIRECTION OR THEIR CONTROL. THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING ON THE BOARD MAKING DECISIONS IN TERMS OF HOW THE APPROACHES THIS IS DONE AND WHETHER ANY BALLOT INITIATIVES ARE PUT ON THE- TABLE OR SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS IS DONE SO. I WOULD APPRECIATE- GIVEN US YOUR SUPPORT AND SENDING A SIGNAL. THAT BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND WORK WITH MY CONSTITUENTS TO DEVELOP. A BILL THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS THAT ACHIEVES OUR GOALS AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE STATE. TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED THE ROLL. THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN OH FIVE BY SENATOR WAS SO THE pREFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE BATES. CABALLERO HOW TO YOUR AYE CORTESE BUT WHAT HAS HE AYE MCGUIRE. PHOTOBOOK NO. PHOTOBOOK NOW SKINNER. SKINNER HI I'M BURKE WHAT KASKY HI MY CASKEY I WILL PUT THAT ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER HUESO- WE WILL NEXT- GO TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN BY CENTER HERTZBERG- SERVICE FOR YOU MAY COME FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANKS WILLINGNESS TO STEP IN FOR ME THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET A LETTER PLANES ARE. AND STILL DO WITH MY OTHER ISSUES. ON. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR- YES AND- WELL OVER A YEAR. AND THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DEAL WITH LEGISLATION IN IN THIS AREA WHAT WAS THE PROBLEMS WHAT ARE THE ISSUES I WAS TRYING TO SOLVE IN COMING UP WITH THIS. THE FIRST PRODUCTION. WE JUST HEARD FROM THE- LAST AUTHOR ABOUT THE ISSUE OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH HOMES IN CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE- INCREASE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY. SO MANY LEVELS QUESTIONS WHAT KIND OF HOUSING IN LIKE THAT STARTING WITH THE ISSUE PRODUCTION. SIX SECOND. THE ISSUE OF THE RICH POOR DIVIDE. WHEN WE BILL HOUSING WHAT WE DO OFFICE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE APARTMENTS WERE SPENDING TAX DOLLARS MONEY THAT WE COULD USE FOR FOSTER KIDS OR FOR A PRESCHOOL OR FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW WE GET A BUNCH OF MONEY BUT I'VE CERTAINLY LIVED IN LIFE WHEN THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. AND SO YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU DO SOMETHING WE GIVE SOMEONE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD BUT GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY CRAIG GENERALIZED GENERAL A GENERATIONAL WEALTH TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OWN SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW AS WE DO WITH THE RICH POOR DIVIDE WE SEE IN THE NEWSPAPER OF THE LAST. YEAR HOW MANY RICH PEOPLE THAT RICHARD RICHARD WE'RE FIGHTING FOR EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE IN COMMITTEE AFTER COMMITTEE OF DEALING WITH FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE RESOURCES AND SO HOW YOU DO THAT. THIRD HOW DO YOU DO WITHOUT TAX DOLLARS HOW DO YOU DO THAT GREEN CROUCHING IN CROWDING IN THE WITH ALL THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND GOVERNMENT AGAIN NOW WE'VE GOT MONEY BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE I GUARANTEE IT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE PENDULUM FOR ALL OF US HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE WE SURE THAT WORKS. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF FOLKS FORMER DIRECTOR OF FINANCE TO ENGAGE. FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS- THE- THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING AUTHORITY AND- OR CARRINGTON AND HEAD OF PUBLIC FINANCE IT AT OR CARRINGTON AND EXPERT ON HOUSING AND WE SAT DOWN KIND OF WITH A BLANK SLATE SO THAT WE FIGURED OUT. AND SO WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE. KIND OF REVERSE ENGINEERED. HOW TO GET TO GO. BECAUSE THESE ISSUES BY HOUSING. AND ALLOW THE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S KILLED IN TRAIN. WELL THAT'S A QUESTION OF IT WHAT IS IT GOING TO THE RENT. WILL OWNERSHIP GOES INTO THE PURCHASE PRICE. AND WHERE DO YOU GET THE MONEY AND HOW TO MAKE IT WORK SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS THIS AND THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES AND- I WANT TO. JUST FOR THE RECORD MAKE SURE WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR IMPORTANT COMMENTS HERE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE WE DON'T WITH THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK. BUT AS I SUGGESTED YOU CHAIRED TO THE CHAIR OF THAT. THEY HOUSING COMMITTEE THE OTHER HOUSE WE CAN HELP. WITH YOUR HELP. SO THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE. BUT THE BASIC FRAMEWORK IS HERE. SO WHAT HAPPENS WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND- PUT ON THE BALLOT WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUE. THAT BOND ISSUES GOING TO HAVE TWO COMPONENTS TO IT. THE FIRST IS EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS. WHICH IS GOING TO GO FOR DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND THE OTHER SEVEN BILLION IS GOING TO BE TO. HELP IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR OFF SITE. IMPROVEMENTS WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. BECAUSE LOTS OF TENSION PEOPLE DEVELOPERS GO TO DEVELOP. THAT THERE'S THEY DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS OR INFRASTRUCTURES YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT A FINANCIAL MECHANISM WE USE THAT FINANCIAL MECHANISM OVER THE YEARS. IN BELARUS OTHER THINGS BUT WE NEED A FINANCIAL MECHANISM HERE. SECOND THE IDEA BEHIND THE BONDISSUE IS NOT TO HAVE THE STATE PAY LIKE REDUCE. WITH PART BONDS OR HAVE THE STATE PAY LIKE REDUCE HOUSING WITH WITH WITH SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. THE IDEA HERE IT'S CALLED WHAT'S CALLED THE SELF LIQUIDATING BOND. SO WHY WE DOING A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND WITH THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT. WELL EUROPE UPWARD PRESSURE BECAUSE OF INFLATION UPWARD PRESSURE BECAUSE OF COSTS. YOU NEED TO FIND PLACES YOU CAN SAVE MONEY WHEN YOU MAKE AN ECONOMIC MODEL. IN THIS HOUSING SITUATION IF WE CAN USE THE BORROWING POWER AND THE GUARANTEE OF THE STATE. AND BASICALLY THE MORTGAGES ARE GOING TO PAY BACK THE LOAN. THAT REDUCES INTEREST COST IF YOU REDUCE INTEREST COSTS. GIVES YOU MORE LATITUDE. FOR BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE TO HAVE HOMES. SO BY HAVING THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IT'S CALLED THE SELF LIQUIDATING BOND. AND SO THEY'LL BE A LITTLE BIT THE INTERESTED WE CAN CHARGE WILL BE LOT SMALLER ON THE SECOND TRY STAY. ARE HERE'S BASS. HOW IT. IN THE SAME. TERMS SO. UP I WANT TO GO OUT. AND I MAKE A QUALIFYING AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYER. AND I WANT TO BUY A HOUSE I GO TO THE BANK. WE'RE GONNA GIVE THE BANK BOARD OF A POINT OR SOMETHING GIVEN COMMITTEE WE INVEST MATT CREDIT. AND THEY'RE GONNA GO TO. CALAIS JEFF FAY AND THEY'RE GONNA GET A LOAN OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO PUT FROM ALL THE DATA AND TALKING TO ALL THE EXPERTS IS THAT THERE'S NO DOWN PAYMENT WHATSOEVER. THAT THE DEFAULT RETIRED. SO IF IT'S A SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENCE FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT. WILL COME FROM. THIS FUND. NOW WHAT HAPPENS. THAT THAT MONEY THAT COMES FROM THE FUND. GETS RECORDED AS A SECOND TRUSTEE WE CALLED A SILENT SECOND. AGAINST THE HOUSE SO BANK OF AMERICA OR WELLS FARGO YOUR CREDIT UNION HAS THE FIRST TRUSTEE. FOR WHATEVER IT IS THE SECOND TRUST DEEDS RECORDED. NOW HOW DOES THAT GET PAID. WHAT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE A FORTY YEAR LOAN. WITH FIFTEEN YOUR PAYOFF DATE. SO THE ARAB WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE DATE AS THE AVERAGE PERSON CELLS ARE HOUSE AND NINE YEARS WE RUN ALL THE NUMBERS WITH THE EXPERTS. DETERMINE WE CAN PAY THIS OFF. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SELF LIQUIDATING FUND WORKS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE SOONER. LIKE WE SEEN BEFORE WITH THREE FINANCES. YOU HAVE TO PAY OFF SECOND TRUSTEE. IF YOU. KEEP YOUR HOUSE FIFTEEN YEARS WILL BE A BALLOON PAYMENT YOU'LL PAY IT OFF. THE STATE'S PROTECTED. WHAT HAPPENS THE BORROWER HOW DOES THE- THAT OF THE INVESTORS WHO ARE BUYING THESE BOND GET PAID BACK. WELL THEY'LL BE TEMPTED INTEREST OF. WHATEVER SMALL PERCENTAGES SMALLEST PERCENTAGE WE CAN DO WELL RUNNING AND THE NUMBERS ON THAT. AND IT'LL YOU COULD PAY ALONG THE WAY IF YOU WANT TO. OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CASH FLOW. YOU'LL PAY IT OUT OF THE SALE. SO HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN INCREASE IN VALUE OF THE HOUSE. YOU PAY OFF THAT LOAN ELIZABETH HAPPENING IF YOU HAVE EQUITY. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IF YOU'RE THERE FOR TEN YEARS. GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE A RENTER. WHEN YOU'RE A RENTER AT THE END OF TENURE HERE'S- WOULD YOU HAVE HIRING HERE YOU HAVE A RATE MORTGAGE IT NEVER UP WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MINIMUM WAGE US FOLKS WHERE'S THE MONEY GO GOES TO PLACES ARE UTILITY BILLS AND HIGHER RENT ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW YOU HAVE LESS PRESSURE ON THE RENT SO IT'S ALL ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP IT'S AN ELEGANT WAY TO USE THE GOOD THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE COSTS WE'RE PUTTING IN FOR SKILLED AND TRAINED PEOPLE ARGUE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD IN THE RENTAL SITE WILL THAT COST MORE MONEY. WILL GOING TO CENTER CRETACEOUS POINT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT A SYSTEM THAT GETS PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE WITH THEM EIGHT PEOPLE REASONABLE WAGES WITH ALL THE VARIOUS BELLS AND WHISTLES ARE NECESSARY AND WITH THAT INCREASES THE COST AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE NOT WORRIED IT FIT ROLLS INTO THE PRICE WHICH IS THEN PAID WHEN YOU DO THE ECONOMICS AND WE HAVE THE ANALYSIS WHICH I CAN SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE AND SO BASICALLY IT IS A PRETTY ELEGANT WAY. TO CREATE EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC FEEDBACK AFFECT THE PROPERTY TAX IMPACTS GREAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIRMAN RAISED WHICH I THINK APPROPRIATE IS WE'RE NOT QUITTING LEVITTOWN THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE'RE JUST WE'RE GONNA HAVE COULD TAKE SOME CONTROL ON THIS FALL WILL BE A LOT OF PARTS OF THE STATE WITH US WE REALLY REALLY GREAT. FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS GUESS WHAT THEY GET A NEW HOUSE WITH NEW APPLIANCES WITH NEW EVERYTHING YOU'RE NOT BUYING GRANDMA'S HOUSE WITH A LEAKY ROOF AND LEAKY PIPES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU BOUGHT IT NOW YOU GOT AN EXPENSE TO FIX THE EIGHT THE HVAC SYSTEMS OR SOMETHING ELSE WE GOT A BRAND NEW PLACE WITH WARRANTY PARTS AND DONE THROUGH SKILLED AND TRAINED SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT IS IT IS A WAY I THINK PRETTY ELEGANTLY AS I USE THAT TERM TOO MUCH TO MEET ALL THE GOALS AND I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED AS WE- LOOK AT ALL THE LEGISLATION THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND IN THIS CHAMBER. AND ISSUES THAT WE FACE BECAUSE OF THIS RICH POOR DIVIDE HOW DO WE CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUILD WEALTH HOME IS WHERE THE WEALTH. IS MOST PEOPLE HAVE WELL FOR THE WHOLE WE'VE GOT A- OF THE GAME WE'VE GOT TO MOVE AWAY. ALL THIS. I HAVE IN MY COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S A SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR RENTAL HOUSE FOR A LITTLE SMALL FOR STILL GOING TO NOTHING THING. AND IT'S A RENTAL. LEVEL GETS THE OPS. HEADED GETS THE HEADACHES AND THE INCREASE BILLS- CENTER CUBBY EUROS IS A JOINT AUTHORS CENTER PORTANTINO IS- CENTER ROTH WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED ON. BY OBJECTIVE IF ANYBODY WANTS TO HELP WE'RE HERE WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THIS. BILL IS TRIPLE REFERRED. TO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT. ARMED WE GOTTA CHANGE UP THE GAME AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. AND THE- THE REASON THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS MONEY IS DODO DEVOTED TO WHAT WE CALL MEZZANINE FINANCING OFFSITE. IMPROVEMENTS IS AGAIN. WE DON'T WANT THIS JUST TO BE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WE WANT COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE REVENUE. AND THEN THE DEVELOPER WILL PAY OFF THAT DEBT LOAD. FROM THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY. AND SO. WE THINK IT WORKS PRETTY WELL WE'VE DONE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ANALYSIS ON IT. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE'VE GOT- THE BUILDING TRADES HERE. THE JOURNEY WOULD GO. ALWAYS OVER THERE AND THEN ALSO I BELIEVE MATT CALLAHAN. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAME INTO YOU GUYS BUT I KNOW HE'S WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT FROM. HOME OWNERSHIP GROUP IN IN LOS ANGELES TO- TESTIFYING BEHAVE. ON BEHALF OF US MEASURE GREAT THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG I WILL NOW GO TO A SUPPORT TESTIMONY FOR SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND- SO WE HAVE TO THE WITNESSES. OF FIRST- MISTER SMITH IN THE BUILDING TRADES- AND YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES TO CENTER HER TREATED SEVEN OF THE SECOND. MADE WITH US. YES OKAY SO.

I'D BE REMISS IF I DID TAKE A COUPLE SECONDS HRE- TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE ROOM WERE IN THE BUILDING WE'RE IN WAS BUILT. BY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS APPRENTICES AND JOURNEYMEN AND WOMEN. FROM THE BUILDING TRADES- I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE THE BUILDING- WE- I THINK I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE- POINT OUT THE FACT THAT. OUR MEMBERS BUILT THIS BUILDING. OF THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED ALLOWED THEM TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND- HELP LOCAL ECONOMY. AND THOSE WAGES AND BENEFITS NO DOUBT HELP MANY OF THEM BY MAINTAIN THEIR OWN HOMES. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND WHAT WE BELIEVE AS SB FORTY THIRTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW. THOUSANDS OF OTHER FAMILIES TO DO. ON THE AMERICAN DREAM. AS THE TO THE ANTENNAS. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS AND BUILD MORE HOMES FOR THE MIDDLE. AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR MEMBERS RESIDE. IN THE MIDDLE. EVERYBODY EARNS MONEY IN DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE TO WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE TRAPPED IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF RUNNING. FOREVER LIKELY INCLUDING MANY OF OUR MEMBERS THAT WE THAT I REPRESENT. WHO DREW BEING FIRST GENERATION HOMEOWNERS AN INNOVATIVE IDEA. WITH MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ENTER THEIR FRIENDSHIP THEY DO SO HOPING. THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH TO BUY THEIR OWN HOME. WITH THE YARD IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD CLOSE TO GOOD SCHOOLS IN MANY OF THEM ARE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF POLICIES LIKE MODEST BUILDING THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THE PREVAILING WAGE. BECAUSE OF THEIR TRAINING. SB FORTY FIFTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE THAT CHANCE TO THOUSANDS OF OTHER CALIFORNIA'S AS WELL. ON TOP OF THE INNOVATIVE WHETHER THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO WORKING. FAMILIES IT IS THE CONSTRUCTION WORK THAT WILL COME FROM THIS BILL. GONZALEZ WORK THAT WILL GO TOWARDS THE PRE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THAT WILL ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. ON THESE PROJECTS TO EARN A MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG AND MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM THANK YOU SENATOR CORTEZ HE- OF YOUR COMMENTS- AGREE WITH THIS. PREMISE AND THAT CENTER HERTZBERG IS INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THE WORKERS DOING THE PRE DEVELOPMENT WORK. NEEDED TO BUILD THE HOMES WILL COME FROM CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVED. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND WE PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. THOSE WORKERS WILL GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME WE DON'T BELIEVE. ANY OF THAT HE WAS REQUIREMENTS INCREASES COSTS. THE AMOUNT TIME DEVELOPER SAVE ON THE BACK END BY HAVING WORK DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. WE THINK MORE THAN. MORE THAN MAKES UP ON ANY ON ANY INCREASED COSTS- THE BILL PROVIDES MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION. OPERATIVE ON THE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS WHICH IS A BENEFITS OF THE WORKERS BILLION HOUSING. CAN AFFORD TO BUY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BUILD OUR WEATHER'S HOUSING CRISISBUT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE. ON THE BACKS OF EXPLOITED IN LOW WAGE WORKERS. AGAIN WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG REASON YOU CAN'T HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT PROTECTION FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WERE PLEASE NAY POOREST REPORTING PARTIES. THANK THANK YOU RIGHT NOW CENTER WHO THE SECOND WHEN THAT REALITY MIGHT JUST BE CALLING IN ON THE REGULAR YEAH SO- THE MODERATOR- YEAH WHAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL THANK YOU- AND THEN MISTER CALLAHAN CAN CAN SPEAK- HELLO ABOUT MINUTES TWENTY SECONDS- SO IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM- WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

GOOD FOR SUPPORT FOR SB ONE FOUR FIVE SEVEN THESE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME GET- PRESS ONE ZERO FOR SB ONE FOUR FIVE SEVEN. AND NINE FORTY YOUR OPEN CALLAHAN WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNERS AND HOMEOWNERSHIP SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A WEALTH BUILDING POWER HOUSE FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO PROVIDE THE PREDICTABLE MONTHLY HOUSING EXPENSE THAT ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE AS A HOMEOWNERS ICOME RISES. HOMEOWNERSHIP OFFERS BETTER HOUSING PRESERVATION WITH FAMILIES FACE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL TIMES IT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR FUTURE FINANCIAL GOALS LIKE RETIREMENT AND IT'S THE MOST DIRECT PATH PROVIDING GENERATIONAL WEALTH. HOMEOWNERSHIP GROSS ATTACK SPACE CREATES COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS IT STIMULATES THE ECONOMY AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES WE SEE LOWER CRIME RATES AND IMPROVE SCHOOL TEST SCORES. HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA WE SEE THAT THE STATE'S OVERWHELMING INVESTMENT PRIORITY HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED RENTAL HOUSING PROJECTS THAT GENERATE BIG FEES FOR DEVELOPERS AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT- BUT DO NOT HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACCESS THE TYPE OF HOUSING THEY REALLY WANT. AND THAT'S HOMEOWNERSHIP S. B. OF FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GOES A LONG WAY PROVIDING BALANCE TO THE STATE HOUSING- AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGY. THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE FINANCING OF WILL PROVIDE AS A CREATIVE WAY TO FILL THE AFFORDABILITY GAP LOW INCOME HOMEBUYERS FACE AND IT ALSO EFFECTIVELY REMOVES THE SAVINGS BARRIER. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL LEVERAGE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE MORTGAGE CAPITAL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE STATE HOUSING STOCK CREATE HIGH PAYING JOBS AND IT DOES ALL THIS WITHOUT HITTING THE TAXPAYERS WALLETS. FOR ALL THE REASONS- JUST STATED WE SUPPORT SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND THANK CENTER HURTS HERTZBERG CHRIS LEADERSHIP IN EXPANDING HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE TELEPHONE MR MURRAY IN SUPPORT. I NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME GREAT WHEN I GO TO OPPOSITION IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM MR CYRUS- MARC STATUS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP THIS BILL BENNETT PRINT A FEW MORE DAYS IN THE LAST ONE SO WE ALSO DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION. BUT WE HAVE COMMUNICATED SOME COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR- WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORT TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO STABILIZE HOUSING COSTS AND BUILD WEALTH WE HAVE EXPRESSED A FEW CONCERNS ONE. THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND ON THE BALLOT PARTICULAR ONE OF THIS SIZE IT'S LIKELY TO CROWD OUT OTHER BACK OTHER MEASURES- IT SHOULD INCLUDE BOTH RENTAL HOUSING AND HOMEOWNERSHIP THERE ARE MANY LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN IN VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE. WHO HAVE NO HOMES AT ALL WHO ALSO NEED TO BE SERVED AND OUR STATE OF PROGRAMS TO SERVE THOSE POPULATIONS ARE ACTUALLY- AWARDING ALL THE LAST OF THEIR FUNDS FROM THE LAST GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. SECOND IS JUST THAT- THERE A COUPLE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY UNDERMINE EXISTING OCC AFFORDABILITY PROVISIONS IN SB THIRTY FIVE AND IN LOCAL INCLUSIONARY ZONING ORDINANCES WE BELIEVE THAT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOMES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO LOWER INCOME FOLKS SO WE WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR BUT WE'VE SHARED THOSE CONCERNS AND WE'LL WE'LL- HAVE MORE COVERAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY IN THE HEARING ROOM SINGLE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES WILL THE MODERATOR PLEASE I ASK FOR OPPOSITION. TESTIMONY FOR PEOPLE TO STATE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION IF ANY. AND THE FACT OF THEIR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER. IF YOU LIKE TO TESTIFY OPPOSITION TO SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.

NOBODY ELSE WAS QUEUING UP THE STRUCTURE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER BY CAL SKI. YEAH I GUESS. WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT- LOW INCOME PEOPLE HIGH INCOME PEOPLE I THINK THIS IS REALLY. A MEASURE ON THE MISSING MIDDLE I MEAN IT CALL IT WHAT IT IS I MEAN IT'S NICE. MY UNDERSTOOD MY READING OF IT IS SB THIRTY FIVE ONLY KICKS IN. IF PEOPLE WANT TO USED TO STREAMLINING BENEFITS OF SB THIRTY FIVE OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST A REGULAR. HOUSING PROJECT THE GOES AND GETS ENTITLED THIS AM I WRONG ON THAT YEAH I KNOW YEAH I THINK IT IS THE IDEA HERE BEHIND THIS IS THAT. IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER AN INCENTIVE TO DEVELOPERS THAT WILL COME IN AND BULD. THE COMMITTEE ADDED ON TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE FOR- MIXED USE WHICH I THAT'S KIND OF COOL BECAUSE YOU GET AT THAT IN. TERMS OF THE YOU GET THAT FINANCED WITH COMMERCIAL SIDE BUT IT'S REALLY MODEL ON A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL IN A SENSE OKAY. BECAUSE YOU GOTTA MAKE THE RATE OF RETURN FROM INVESTORS I KNOW THE POINT STRIVERS ABOUT. ABOUT MENTAL BUT THEN THAT MEANS IF IT'S RENTAL THAT MEANS TACKLE USING TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THIS WE GO TO THE L. A. ONLY ASK THE L. A. O. TO MODEL THIS WE WANT TO SHOW IT'S A LOW RISK TO TAXPAYERS OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TOWARD. WITH THE WHOLE THEORIES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AND MAKE IT A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL NOW. THE PUT IT WHAT WILL PROBABLY DO IS THE RESULT OF HOW THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMITTEE PUT IN WHICH IS IMPORTANT I GET IT. WILL PROBABLY HAVE SO A DEVELOPMENTS IF CONDOS A ROW HOUSES OR SOMETHING IN. IT AND- CENTER CARPIO'S DISTRICT AND MAYBE DEDICATE SOME OF THOSE FOR LOWER PRICED. BUT THE DELTA HAS TO BE MADE UP WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK OUT THAT FINANCE OUR FINANCE PEOPLE TO TELL US. THAT'S WORKABLE. BUT IT'S NOT IN THE NORMAL CONTEXT OF. AS WAS INDICATED BY MISTER CALLAHAN THE TRADITIONAL SUBSIDIZED RENTAL MARKET. THIS IS THE MISSING MIDDLE IT IS THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE NURSE. AND THE AND THE WORK RATE IS THE TEACHER. WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO EVERY SINGLE DAY. ARE SPENDING EVERY NICKEL THEY HAVE TO LIVE AND THEY CAN NEVER COME UP WITH THE SCRATCH. FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A DOWN PAYMENT FOR SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. WE'RE GONNA WRITE IN THAT CHECK. THEY COME UP WITH SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THEY CAN GET A HOUSE. GET ON THE ROAD TO START MAKING MONEY. AND HAVING ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WORK TO KILL ANYBODY. REALLY IS NOT. DESIGNED FOR THAT BECAUSE IT'S A FINANCIAL MODEL. THE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING PRECLUDES. ONCE THE PROJECTS. WELL WE CAN DEAL WITH. YOU HAVE TO THE MODEL HAS TO BE THAT MISSING MIDDLE AND WHAT. IF THE PRICE OF IT IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY GOTTA. PUT ALONG TOGETHER FOR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT GETS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT YOU KNOW. AND IF IT GOES UP TO MILLION IN SOME AREAS. HE GIVE A 1-005-000-0800 FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT PUTS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT SO IT MAY BE. PEOPLE WITH THAT WORK FOR US NO THAT DISCONTENT DISCONNECT DISTRACTED IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM. WHAT DO YOUR ECONOMIST SAY ON THE FIFTEEN- YOUR BALLOON WHILE I KNOW THAT THAT GIVES US COMFORT IF I'M HOLDING. THE LOAN BUT- TELL ME HOW THAT WORKS ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE- BECAUSE- IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE PRICES GO UP. ASTRONOMICALLY IT'S A NOTHING BURGER IT'S EASY PEOPLE GET THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW GOING FORWARD. IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT APPRECIATION. OF THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THESE REFINANCING DEALS. SIMPLE WELL TWO POINTS THE GENERAL CASKET WHAT NUMBER ONE IS WE ANALYZE A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR YEARS OF THE GROWTH HOUSING IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE REASON QUITE FRANKLY. WITH ALL THESE INVESTORS ARE COMING IN BUYING UP HOUSING EVERYWHERE BECAUSE TO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MODEL NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IS WE'VE WRITTEN IN THE FLEXIBILITY FOR CALLAGY FAYE TO THE EXTENT CHANGE MODIFY SO BECAUSE AGAIN. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE EVEN IN TERMS OF THESE NUMBERS IT HAS TO BE BALANCED BY OUR PUBLIC POLICY IDEAS. WITH A FINANCIAL MODEL THAT WORKS. BECAUSE THE REASON FINANCIAL MODELS WORK ON SOME OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT USES TAX DOLLARS. INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR PRESCHOOL OR FOSTER CARE WHATEVER AND THEY PAY THE DIFFERENCE AND SO THIS IS A PRETTY INTERESTING WAY. TO ACHIEVE THAT THAT THAT SPREAD HOW DO YOU LIKE OKAY OUR COSTS ARE HIGHER BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET FAIR WAGES WHAT WE'RE GONNA OVER HERE REDUCE INTEREST COSTS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE STATE. FIGURES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPERS WITH HIS SB THIRTY FIVE WITH THE LATENT DEFECTS WITH OTHER THINGS BUT GET I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS. YOU IF YOU WANT THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO BUILD UNDER THIS PROGRAM. NONE OF THESE BENEFITS AND NONE OF THE MONEY GETS ACCESSIBLE TO YOU OR THE BANKS THAT CALIPERS OR TO ANYBODY UNLESS WHEN YOU START A PROJECT YOU AGREE TO. CONFORM TO THIS PROGRAM YOU CAN FOR THE PROGRAM. NOW. SOMEBODY GOES TO A LOCAL BANK. THEY IN THEIR SEVEN DOLLARS SEVEN DOT FIVE ZERO. AND THEIR CREDIT REPORT AND WHATEVER THEIR NUMBERS ARE. AND THEY GET A HOUSE YEAH AND THEN THEY CAN SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE AFTERWARDS WENT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. BOTH ITS REVOLVING IT CREATES ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND HOUSES WHAT WE BEST ESTIMATE. AND WE SAY FOR EVERY MILLION IT BILLION HALF DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND. IN THIS DEVELOP AND WE GET TO A ONE BILLION AT ONE ELEVEN BILLION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE LOAN THE PROPERTY TAX INCREASES LEVEL OF THE OTHER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE END LET ALONE ALL THE IN INCOME TAX AND STUFF THAT HAPPENS RESULT OF THE BUILDING. BUT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC MODEL I JUST WANNA TELL YOU. THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR BUILDING HOUSES BUT SOME YEARS AGO WE DID A NUMBER OF SCHOOL BONDS. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO THE FOLKS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES THEY SAID THAT THEY SAVE THEM WHEN WE GOT TO THE DOWNTURN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. BUILDING ALL THOSE SCHOOLS WAS ABLE TO KEEP MONEY IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE COULD STILL WORK. AND WE DID THAT SO THIS TO ME IT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BENEFITS- BY THE COR. GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME AND UNFORTUNATELY CENTER WE DON'T THINK MANY OF MY GONNA FIND HOMES IN YOUR PLACE. YOU KNOW BUT TO AT THE CENTER CABALLERO SHE'S GONNA HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY HER COMMITTEES. AND SENATE ROTH AND OTHERS AND JEFF IN A VALLEY FOR ME AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE A LOT OF SPACE TO BUILD HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO. TRUST ME. UP SO SORRY BUT THANK YOU GREAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES THE OFFENDER JOGO I DO HAVE A COMMON NIGHT. SO UNDER THIS PROGRAM- PREVAILING WAGE IS PRETTY MUCH A SET DEAL ON IRAQ CORRECT SO THERE WAS A CONCERN OR COMMENT NOT THINK IT'S ARE MORE OF A COMMENT ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE LIVING WAGES CORRECT RIGHT SO. BY YOUR ASSERTION IT DOES INCLUDE A PREVAILING WAGE WHICH DOESN'T MEAN OR SHOULD I SAY LET ME ASK. ME FRIEDMAN A LITTLE DIFFERENT THE PREVAILING WAGE BEING IN THERE. MEANING YOU DON'T HAVE TO OR PEOPLE THAT ARE NON LABOR. AT COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY THAT PREVAILING WAGE YEAH THE FISCAL BETWEEN WORKERS THAT'S CORRECT ALL THEY HAVE TO BE WHAT SAYING ISN'T I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE NOT. YET WOMEN FROM NINE EIGHT SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I CLARIFY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A UNION. THE COMPANY TO. THE TO PAY THAT PREVAILING WAGE CORRECT I. JAMIE YEAH MISTER SMITH FOUR CORRECT REFORM WRONG THE SKILLED WORKFORCE VERSIONS DON'T MANDATE UNION MANDATES THE WAGE LEVEL AND THE MANDATES THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE WORKERS HAVE TO COME OUT OF A START STATE CERTIFIED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- AND THAT CAN BE UNION OR NONUNION AND PRACTICE IT WILL TEND TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE A UNION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES OKAY SO JUST MAKING SURE SO- FOR THE BIDDING PROCESS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT DOES THAT INCLUDE ANYONE THAT IS NOT. CONSIDERED A LABOR. AB COMPANY A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO BID ON THIS JOB AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS A COMMON IN THE PREVIOUS SPELL THAT. WE ARE VERY LIMITED I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS ON FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY BUT- COMMITTEE OR I CAN MEET BUT- THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN CONSTRUCT. AND SO WHAT THAT DOES IS IF YOU LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THE COMPANIES THAT CAN BID ON THOSE PROJECTS ME IS THE PRICE OF THE PROJECTS GO OUT. IF WE OPEN IT TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE HERE THAT IS LICENSED UNDER THE STATE DO YOU HAVE A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF. DAVID NON LABOR. AT TRAINING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT CAN ALSO- PROVIDE SKILLED AND TRAINED. LABOR BUT I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT PROJECTS IN THE STATE THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND HAVING- DIVERSE OUT POOLS OF PEOPLE COMING AND HAVING THAT CAN MAKE OPPORTUNITY IS BEING- NON DISCRIMINATORY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- AT THE STATE CREATING PROGRAMS THAT ALLOWS ANYONE. THAT IS LICENSED UNDER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR OWN PRIVATE- TRAINING- FOR THEIR THEIR EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON THIS PROJECT AND WORK ON THESE PROJECTS ANSWER MY GOVERNMENT MR. THE GERMAN SUGGESTED GETTING HIS THOUGHTS IN THE NASCO HELPLESSNESS THAT'S OKAY MR YES THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER- THE PROJECT REQUIRES A VENDOR FOR REALLY WAGE- ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE ANYBODY BIDDING ON A PROJECT IF SOMEBODY BUT PERSON OWNS A BUSINESS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BID ON THE PROJECT BECAUSE OF PREVAILING WAGE THAT IS THEIR CHOICE- BUT MOST STATE FUNDING AS AS- CUT PUT UNDER THIS BILL MOST A FUNDING REQUIRES A PANDER PREVAILING WAGE. THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF NON UNION STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THE I. DIVISION OF A PERSON'S STANDARDS- CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL THEY BOTH KEEP THOSE NUMBERS AND KEEP THAT DATA BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE JOINTLY- MANAGEMENT UNION- SAID BUT PROGRAMS AND THERE ARE NON UNION UNILATERAL CITIGROUP PROGRAMS. SO FOLKS WHO ARE NON UNION- WOULD BE ABLE TO QUALIFY TO BID. ON THE PROJECTS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL. A CORRECTED ONE OF THE THING THAT THINKS IMPORTANT. YOU MIGHT MY VIEW. IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WHICH IS THE SAME REASON OF SAYING- BUT JUST GO GET PRODUCTION EACH I TRY TO DO A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND WE'RE ECONOMIC REPORTS GOING TO SHOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE HIGHEST RENTS IN THE NATION OKAY THE AVERAGE WAGES STATEWIDE IN CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR AND HOUSEHOLDS MUSTARD THIRTY NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR. I TO AFFORD AN AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM PLACE SO THE IDEA IS IT WOULD BE HOLY AND JUST TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOUR BILL THE HOUSE FOR SOMEONE SAY WHO IS A TEACHER OR A FIREFIGHTER OR WHATEVER. TO GO AND THAT THE HOUSE BUT THE WORKER COULDN'T SUPPORT SO IT REALLY IS A HOLISTIC VIEW IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY YOU SAW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A UNION BUT IT HAS TO BE PEOPLE TRADE. AND THE OTHER PART OF THE SKILLED AND TRAINED PIECE IS THE QUALITY OF THE WORK. OFF ON YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A TEN YEAR LAKE DEFECT LAW IS BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THE WORK OF WE'RE NOW WE'RE GOING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO FIVE YOUR WIFE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD FOR THE GOLD STANDARD AND REALLY DO IT RIGHT WITH PEOPLE ARE SKILLED AND TRAINED. AND NOT HAVE HE'S SAID SUB STANDARD SITUATIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE TIME SO I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY KIND OF IN A SITUATION AS TO HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS OFFER THAT I'M I'M JUST A- WE WISH BUT WE WILL LITERALLY MEET EVERY FRIDAY MORNING IN THE SPENDING. SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING TO THINK IT THROUGH IN A NON POLITICAL WAY TO A BUT BY THE WAY THAT SAYS HOW DO YOU SOLVE THESE MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. IN CALIFORNIA GIVE OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER MIDDLE AND TERMS WITH THOSE. NUMBERS ULTIMATELY ARE SOME PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. JEFF HAD LEFT A YOU. AS A- SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THE PREVAILING AND- FINE WITH THE PRE WAGE AND- ON THAT I DO UNDERSTAND IT'S MY IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ANYTHING THAT IS STATE FUNDED IS AND QUALIFIES FOR PREVAILING WAGE THAT IS NOT AT ALL MY CONCERN I THINK MY CONCERN IS. MOSTLY AND I PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS THE FACT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT IN STATUTE WHO CAN AND CANNOT- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS FOR ANY COMPANY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT. I WON I DO BELIEVE IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THAT IS VERY VERY POOR THAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM AND NUMBER TWO THAT- WHEN WE WHEN WE SPECIFY THE TYPE OF LABOR THAT WE WANT OR WHO CAN AND CANNOT WORK WE REALLY DISCRIMINATING ACTUALLY. FOR THAT OF EACH AB FOR THAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND SO THAT THAT IS MY BIGGEST BIGGEST CONCERN AND USUALLY- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE DO PUT THESE ARCHELAUS IN PLACE IT REALLY AT DESCENT OF ISIS PEOPLE FROM BIDDING ON THE PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE CHANCES OF THEM GETTING PICKED UP. AS THE CONTRACTOR ACTUALLY DIMINISHES THEIR OPPORTUNITY FROM ACTUALLY PURSUING THESE THESE CONTRACTS AND SO THAT TO ME IS OF A CONCERN BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN. BASED ON MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS I WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT IN THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT EQUITY THIS IS EQUITABLE TALK ABOUT EQUITY. EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF GETTING THESE CONTRACTS- AND AS FAR AS THE NOTION OF SKILL AND TRAIN BECAUSE IT MAY- YOU ARE GUARANTEED A BETTER PRODUCT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FREE MARKET- IN PLACE. THE COM. THAT DON'T PROVIDE A QUALITY GOOD. WILL NOT BE CHOSEN OR SELECTED ON ANY OF THESE FACTORS NO MATTER HOW LOWER OR HOW HIGH THE PRICES THEY WILL NOT BE IT THEY WILL NOT BE SELECTED BECAUSE OF THE REPUTATION THAT YOU HAVE OF NOT BEING A- QUALITY CONTRACTOR OR PRODUCING A QUALITY PRODUCT SO I THINK THE NATURAL AT TENNESSEE WOULD BE THAT ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED A STANDARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE EXCLUDED FROM CONSIDERATION FROM CONTRACTS SO. I'M VERY MUCH OF THE OF THE MINDSET THAT YOU BETTER HAVE A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN EQUITABLE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS WE SHOULD PUT IN PLACE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE SENT TO VICE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE NOT OUR CHANCES OF GETTING BIT WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GO TO THE PROCESS AND THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE COST OF THOSE PROJECTS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE BIDDING ON THESE PROJECTS THEN YOUR COST YOU KNOW EVERYBODY THAT IS CURRENTLY ABLE TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS CAN INFLATE THE PRICE A LITTLE- YOU KNOW HIGHER BECAUSE- THIS IS GOING TO BET ON IT. YOU'RE LIMITED ON HOW IT WAS TO I MUST HAVE BEEN A NET IT INADEQUATE IN HOW I EXPLAIN THIS THERE IS NO VETTING PROCESS THERE IS NO SELECTION THE NEW MAKES THE SELECTION EXACTLY A FREE MARKET THE CUSTOMER SO NOW THERE'S THREE DEVELOPERS WHO GO OUT AND SAY- FREMONT CALIFORNIA AND EACH BUILDING FIFTY UNITS OKAY. EACH BUILDING AND THEY'VE QUALIFIED IN THIS PROGRAM THEY HAVE SB THIRTY FIVE THEY. MET ALL THE PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE. DEVELOPER ONE DOLLAR PER A DEVELOPER FOR. CAN WHO MAKES THE CHOI. THE DETERMINATION OF COSTS ARE. THE COST OF THEIR MATERIALS WHAT ARE LABOR COSTS DON'T HAVE LABOR COSTS THE SAME IMAGE ACROSS TO THE SAME WILL DOUBLE MODEL THIS IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN MAKE MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS AND SHE GONNA MAKE MONEY. AND THEN IF ONE MAKES A BETTER PRODUCT GET THE ONLY THERE'S NOBODY ALSO MAKES A CHOICE THE PERSON MAKES THE CHOICE OF THE CUSTOMER I DECIDE TO BUY MR MAKOWSKI SAID DEVELOPERS BECAUSE HE'S RATHER RATHER MISTER CORTESE'S PRODUCT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S QUALITY IS BETTER AND THEY MAKE THE CHOICE THERE'S NO BIDDING CONTEST IN THAT SENSE. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME PRETTY MUCH THE SAME COSTS FOR LABOR COSTS SO YEAH AND SO THE ARGUMENT IS WILL INCREASE COSTS BUT THAT'LL BE ABSORBED OVER TIME IN TERMS OF THE AMORTIZATION. OF THE PAYMENT BECAUSE THE HOUSE MAY COST A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE LABOR COSTS WITH MORE SO THE DOWN PAYMENTS AT A BIT MORE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT COSTS ARE LESS BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE LESS AND IT WORKS IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO LISA TOYOTA. AT THE STORE YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT THE COST OF THE ALTERNATOR IS THE TIRES YOU SEE WHAT'S MY MONTHLY PAYMENT THIS IS BASICALLY THE SAME THING WAS THE QUALITY PRODUCT I LIKE IT AND WHAT'S MY MONTHLY PAYMENT THOSE ARE THE THINGS TO THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO MAKE A PROFIT. THE BANK NEEDS TO MAKE PROFIT TO MAKE IT WORK THE OWNERS GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN. THAT THEY LIKE SO NOBODY ELSE IS MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF PRICE OTHER THAN THE AND THE QUALITY OF THE WORK OTHER THAN THE CUSTOMER AND THAT. AT THE CORE IS CAPITALISM. OKAY SINGLE MOTION. CORRECT SO- CENTER HERTZBERG THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMONS FRAMEWORK ON THE WORK US OUT IF WE SHOULD TO HELP- WE NEED HELP ABSOLUTELY THE- OF COURSE THE YOU KNOW THIS BILL BEING UP TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND THAT IS. AN ISSUE FOR- FURTHER COMMITTEES ON THE GOVERNOR AND PROTON IN THE SPEAKER AT CETERA AND GOT ON IT SOMEWHERE BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOUSING POLICY ITSELF WAS AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING SB THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINING- WHICH HAS- WHICH DOES DOES HAVE PREVAILING WAGE AS WELL AS A SKILLED WORKFORCE AND HAS BEEN. VERY SUCCESSFUL AND STREAMLINING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THAT- ALSO- WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIMITED TO SINGLE FAMILY YES I GREW UP WITH AND WITH THE BACKYARD WILL LOVE BACKYARDS- BUT OUR MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS DO NOT A PRIVILEGE OF FORTY IN BACKYARD- AND AS A MATTER OF SAVING MOTHER EARTH FROM CLIMATE DESTRUCTION- WE CAN'T- SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND BACKYARDS ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WE HAVE TO ALSO. FOCUS ON MULTI UNIT IN SUSTAINABLE LOCATIONS ARE SPEAKING OF WHICH I'M ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS HOW DOES LIMIT THE BILL TO NON SPRAWL AREAS SO- THE DEFINITION OF INFILL SO THAT WE'RE NOT- EXACERBATING OTHER CLIMATE FOR WILDFIRE CRISIS- IN ADDITION- ALLOWING A MIXED USE FOR MULTI UNIT WHICH IS IMPORTANT- AND HAVING AN INCOME CAP TO INCLUDE THE BROAD MIDDLE CLASS. ARE AND SO APPRECIATIVE OF THAT- SO- I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THE MARKET RUNNING AND I VOTES- AND WE HAVE A MOTION AND A FROM CENTER CORTEZ C. ABROAD. FLETCHER KILEY OF COVER YOUR I'M SORRY RIGHT THANK THEM VERY CONFUSED THAT I JUST I DON'T CABALLERO MOVED AND- YOU MAY CALL. AND IT'S JUST VERY- EIGHT MADE BY AND IT ALSO ADAPTIVE REUSE. THE ADAPTIVE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT CAME FROM THE CITY BY THE FOR GOVERNMENT. GET A WHOLE THIRTY WAS NEW BUT IF SOMEONE LIKE LIVES IN IT- A COMMERCIAL BUILDING GETS CONVERTED OR A SHOPPING CENTER GETS CONVERTED BUT IT IT'S A NEW PRODUCT. FOR PEOPLE IT'S HOUSING. IS FINE IT'S NEVER TRY TO BE AS EXPANSIVE POSSIBLE IN STRAIGHT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT WORK SO. OFTEN ON THE BALLOT I AM WORKING ON THAT HAVE BEEN. TASKED WITH THE BOOK FROM THE PROJECT TO WORK ON THE BALLOT WE HAVE NO THE BOND ISSUES AT THIS POINT THEY MIGHT BE SOME COMING UP. IN TERMS OF THAT BUT THE WHOLE IDEA IS NOT TO BE NOT TO IMPOSE THE OBLIGATION OF THE CHECK ON TAXPAYERS. AND TO REALLY SHOW THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOT SOME CREATIVITY TO IT AND GIVE PEOPLE HOPE BUT A LOT OF HOUSES AND IT'S AN ONGOING PROGRAM WITH A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. AND SO WITH THAT I CERTAINLY WOULD ASK DR VOTE AND IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED IN JOINING AS AN AUTHOR CO AUTHOR ON THIS. AT THE MORE THE MERRIER BECAUSE MANY TWO THIRDS VOTES IN BOTH HOUSES TO GET THIS ON THE BALLOT. BETTER LOVE IT AND WOULD LIKE AS MANY IDEAS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S HARD NOT HARD BUT IT'S A RIGHT THING TO DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF CENTER HERTZBERG WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL FORTY. FIFTY SO. PERCENT HERTZBERG. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. SENATOR WIENER. AYE WIENER AYE BATES. CABALLERO CABALLERO I CORTESE. RETIRES HE AYE MCGUIRE. PHOTOBOOK NO. A CHAU BOOK NOW SKINNER. THE NUMBER. WE CASKEY HI MAKOWSKI I THIRTY ONE THE BILL HAS ENOUGH- OR NOT HAS FOUR VOTES I WILL PUT ON CALL FOR UP TO MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR ABOUT THE CAR LESS BILL- COULD WE PLEASE- NOTIFY CENTER MAGUIRE'S OFFICE ANSWER SCHEMES OFFICE THAT WE ARE STARTING A LOS BILLS WE CAN OUT ON MORE WORK DONE- OUR LAST BILL- IS S. B. 1482% OR ALLEN CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PATIENCE AND YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. RIGHT AND THE AND BY THE WAY- I DON'T KNOW THE BEGINNING OF THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLY SHORT PODIUMS AND SO YEAH- YOU SHOULD PROJECT BECAUSE YOU'RE A TALL LIKE I AM IT WILL NOT NATURALLY CUT YOUR VOICE. STATURE OKAY. RIGHT WE'RE WORKING ON A BY THE WAY YEAH IT IS A- YOU DO OKAY. SECOND THAT READ- WELL OKAY SO THIS BILL- REQUIRES NEWLY BUILT MULTI FAMILY RESIDENCES IN OUR STATE TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC VEHICLE READY CHARGING ACCESS FOR EVERY HOUSING UNIT THAT IS ALLOCATED TO PARTIES. I'M NOT SHOULD I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE CHARGING BOX IT DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE A PLUG- IT DID JUST REQUIRES THE CAPABILITY OF THE SOMEBODY WANTED. TO MOVE FOR WITH WITH WITH CHARGING THAT THAT THEY BE ELECTRICITY THERE FOR SOME OF THE CHARGE- YOUR- EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. A NUMBER OF KEY THINGS ABOUT THE HISTORY AND HOW IT GOT TO THIS POINT- TALKS ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT. CALLS FOR A PHASE OUT OF THE SALE OF NEW INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION JUST DID A BIG STUDY ON THIS AND- IF YOU HAVE. QUINCY SEE WE'VE GOT OUR TIRE STATE HAS JUST SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE V. CHARGING POINTS THAT THE COMMISSION ESTIMATES THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SUPPORT THIS TRANSITION. SO WE NEED A ONE POINT TWO MILLION OR SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND. SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO- THE- ONE THING IS CLEAR POWERING UP AT HOME. IS THE CHEAPEST MOST CONVENIENT AND MOST RELIABLE FORM OF FUELING AN EEVEE- BUT THOSE BENEFITS ARE FAILING TO REACH COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE MOST. I IN OF FOLKS YOU'VE GOT AS SINGLE FAMILY HOMES GOT THEIR OWN GARAGE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A- PLUG THEIR- YOU YOU KNOW IF I'M ABLE TO CHARGE MY AB FOR EXAMPLE- BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY UNITS. ARE NOT SO LUCKY. HI RETROFITTING CONDOS AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. IS NOT JUST COMPLEXITY IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND THEY RUN INTO BRICK WALLS BECAUSE THE EXPENSE. R. BUT IF YOU INSTALL THE EEVEE READY CHARGING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN YOU CONSTRUCT- IT'S A CREDIT IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE I'LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. SO THEY DIDN'T THE NEWLY IT UPDATED TWENTY TWENTY TWO CAL GREEN BUILDING CODE ONLY REQUIRES GIVING 40% OF MULTI FAMILY PARKING SPOTS. ACCESS TO SOME FORM OF YOU CHARGING. MEANWHILE THE PATCHWORK OF ONLY OVER THREE DOZEN LOCAL BUILDING CODES IS CREATING CONFUSION FOR BUILDERS. IT'S LEAVING BEHIND MANY COMMUNITIES SUCH AS FIRE FOLKS AND FIRED IF DEVASTATED REGIONS AND RURAL AREAS- THESE ARE FOLKS. THEY TYPICALLY LACK THE CAPACITY TO DO ALL. SO MY STAFF IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS. HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- I AM VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM. I TO FIND AS MUCH COMMON GROUND IMPLEMENTING THIS FRAMEWORK AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S THREE KEY TOPICS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON FIRST OF ALL MAKING A VERY CLEAR THE BILL ONLY APPLIES. TO NEW CONSTRUCTION. TWO SPECIFYING- THAT PROVIDING EVEY READY CHARGING ACCESS DOES NOT OBLIGATE A LANDLORD OR BUILDING MANAGER TO PAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY. TO CHARGE ANY RESIDENTS VEHICLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE THERE. BETWEEN THOSE WHO DO HAVE ANY YOU KNOW THE DON'T. AND FINALLY ENSURING THAT THE LEGISLATION IS WORKABLE. IN INCIDENCES WHERE- PARKING SPACES ARE NOT PRE ASSIGNED TO RESIDENCES AND THIS IS A CONCERN WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO FOLKS IN THE APARTMENT HONORED COMMUNITY. ABOUT OUR STATE CLEARLY HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE THE V. CHARGING TRULY ACCESSIBLE TO CALIFORNIANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE IT'S NOT DEMOCRATIZES THEM YET UNFORTUNATELY. WE KNOW AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE UP FRONT COST OF ADDING TV READY CHARGING ACCESS FOR ALL NEW UNITS REPRESENTS. OUR ONLY POINT 003% OF A TYPICAL BUILDINGS COSTS AND HERE'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO NOTE. IT'S JUST 10% OF THE PRESS TO INSTALL THE SAME CONSTRUCTION RETROFIT. SO A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE PUT FORTH BILLS TO. REQUIRE WE BE DISCUSSING THIS IN THE- IN THE CLIMATE WORKING GROUP YOU KNOW. PUTTING IN. YEAH REQUIRING EVERY ABILITY TO PUT IN THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BACKSTAGE- GREAT IDEA SEARCH BUT SO EXPENSIVE- AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD BE STARTING WITH ALL THE NEW CONSTRUCTION WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING MAYBE SOME OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION ALL HAPPEN UNDER. A CENTER HERTZBERG BOND- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO MUCH MORE. COST EFFECTIVE. SO THIS IS A- AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO REACH OUR- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS AND DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS TV CHARGING. AND I'VE GOT TO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE TODAY- REPRESENTING THE BILL'S CO SPONSORS THE FIRST LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES. WHO THE SENIOR MANAGER BACK TERRACE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND THEN ALSO- CERVANTES AND WHO'S THE CO FOUNDER OF THE EEVEE CHARGING FOR ALL COALITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ODD OKAY SO WE'VE TO. SUPPORT WITNESSES- BOTH BY TELECOM- IN THE HEARTS AND SOULS AND THEN SPEND THAT ST- YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES OF THE FIRST WITNESS GOES LONGER THAN TWO MINUTES IT WILL COME OUT OF THE SECOND WITNESSES TWO MINUTES SO. THE MINDFUL- YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON NOW SENATORS. I'M LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES AND ON BEHALF OF ACCURATE AND EASY CHARGING ACCESS FOR ALL COALITION PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THE SPELL I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THE PURPOSE IS SIMPLE TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS OF NEW APARTMENTS AND CONDOS THE SAME ACCESS TO AT HOME EASY CHARGING THAT NEW SINGLE FAMILY HOMES HAVE HAD SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. HERE'S A TRUE STORY AND TWENTY NINETEEN REBEKAH LUCKY PERSONS TO BEEF. SINCE HER APARTMENT MAX CHARGING SHE DROPPED AN EXTENSION CORD TO THE GROUND BELOW TO CHARGE AT THE CURB. THE MANAGER DE IN THE COURT OF TRIPPING HAZARD SHE WAS OR THE PUBLIC TURKEY BUT IMPROVED A WORKABLE QUOTE. I THINK AN HOUR IF YOU TO STOP IN CHARGE IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR OUR FAMILY THE KIDS ENDED UP PLAYING IN THE PARKING SPACES A SAFETY HAZARD. AND ACOSTA FAST PARKING ARE TO ME HI. THERE ABOUT THE TURNED RETURNED HER ET AND RECEIVE DRIVING A GAS CAR. REBEKAH STORY OF. THE FACT THAT BACK TO BACK. TO AFFORDABLE SPEAKERS MEDIA TURKEY. PUT EDIE'S OUT OF REACH FOR MOST RESIDENTS OF APARTMENTS AND CONDOS. ENSURING THEY GET THIS ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ALL NEW CARS SOLD IN THE STATE. SB ZERO EMISSION. SO WHY IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO BUILD NEW HOUSING BUT PARKING SPACES THEY CAN'T CHARGE THOSE FEES. AND THAT'S WHAT OTHER AGENCIES LIKE CARBON XTC HELLO HOPE FOR USING BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO RETROFIT HE'S VERY. STATE BUILDING IN JUST A FEW YEARS. IT MAKES LITTLE AND FOR IT NEGLIGENT. HELLO MUST STOP TO GET A HOLD DEEPER. THE QUOTE FIND IT NUMBER GC YOU MUST BUILD HOUSING NOW THAT'S PREPARED FOR THE QUICK MOBILITY FUTURE EVENTS STUCK IN THE FOSSIL FUEL PASSED. EQUITY IS ALSO AT STAKE HERE THE MAJORITY OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING RESIDENTS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMMUNITIES HEAVILY BURDENED BY AIR POLLUTION. FOR TOO LONG THE CALGARY COATIS PERPETUATED INFRASTRUCTURE RACISM LUCKY MANY BLACK AND BROWN RESIDENTS OUT OF THE U. B. REVOLUTION. VOTING AGAINST OUR BILL IS A VOTE TO BE FAMILY HOUSING WITHOUT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AT HOME CHARGING. SUPPORT EQUITY CLMATE CLEAN AIR VOTE I. N. S. T. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT ARE SECOND THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SPEND THIESSEN AN ENGINEER WITH EIGHTEEN YEARS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE EXPERIENCE AT PG&amp;E AND FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND MY OWN ET CONSULTANT FOR OUR COALITION IS DEDICATED TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO EASY CHARGING WHILE MINIMIZING COST AND COMPLEXITY FOR BUILDERS RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO OPERATE THESE BUILDINGS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA BUT ANY CLAIM THAT THIS BILL IS A COST PROHIBITIVE MANDATE IS INACCURATE IN FACT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROVISIONS THATACTUALLY KEEP BUILDING COSTS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE FIRST BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT EVERY PARKING SPACE. IN A MULTI FAMILY COMPLEX BE WIRED FOR EASY CHARGING INSTEAD IT PROVIDES THAT EVERY NEW UNITS WITH PARKING HAS ACCESS TO ONE E. V. READY PARKING SPACE. FOR EXAMPLE IF A ONE HUNDRED UNIT COMPLEX HAS TWO HUNDRED PARKING SPACES ONLY ONE HUNDRED NEED ELECTRIFICATION NOT ALL TWO HUNDRED. SECOND THE BILL MINIMIZES BUILDER COMPLEXITY AND COSTS BY ELIMINATING CAL GREENSTREET. IBV CHARGING CAPABLE ASSEMBLY LOW POWER TV READY. THIRD THE BILL REDUCES OPERATIONAL COSTS BY ENCOURAGING RUNNING THE WIRING D. A. EACH UNITS METER RATHER THAN THE COMMON METER THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR OVERSIGHT BY APARTMENT MANAGEMENT OR THE H. AWAY WHILE ENABLING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO THEIR UTILITIES LOWEST ELECTRIC RATES. AN EXPERT REVIEWED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THIS BILL WILL ONLY INCREASE NEWBUILD COST BY ZERO POINT ZERO THREE PERCENT. FURTHER IT IS PROJECTED THAT BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NINETY THOUSAND BRAND NEW UNITS WILL REQUIRE FULL RETROFITTING AND A UTILITY PROVIDE A COST OF ONE POINT FIVE. BILLION DOLLARS VERSUS ONLY. TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TWO WHY ARE THEM AT THE OF INITIAL. THANK YOU FOR MUCH OF A COULD- ONE OF. IF LESSONS YEAH THIS BILL WILL FURTHER ACCELERATE EASIEST OPTION AS OTHER STATES FOLLOW OUR-LEADERSHIP.

FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL- I HAVE I'D LIKE TO REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR WORK ON THE ACTUAL COSTS BECAUSE- YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DOING SOME CALCULATIONS AND 3% OR POINT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I CAN'T BE RIGHT SO MAYBE IT'S THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IF IT'S THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO PUT THE PLUG AND JUST RUN THE WIRE OVER HUNDRED UNITS THAT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOES THAT THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT THAT THAT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THE TOTAL OUT ADDITIONAL ELECTRICAL WORK THAT WOULD BE DONE. ON THE SITE TO NOT INSTALLING THE UNIT SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I THINK HE HAD A BETTER IT'S A BETTER SAILING SOMEONE IF THAT THAT PRICE GOES DOWN BUT- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IT. THANK THANK. RABBIT SAID. YEAH 10% SO 30% OF A MILLION IS THREE THOUSAND RIGHT SO 3% IS THIRTY THOUSAND. POINT 003% IS THREE THOUSAND. WHEN YOU AGGREGATE DEBT FOR A HUNDRED UNITS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BUILDING EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS THE ORIGINAL I KNOW THIRTY THOUSAND THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME BENEFIT IS AT A RATE OF THE DAY THE PARKING SPOTS RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER I CAN'T BE A VERY CRUDE- HAVE AVERAGE THAT IS IN A ALSO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE ALREADY WIRING YOUR GARAGE ANYWAY. THE CLASSES ACTUALLY NEGLIGIBLE BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY ALL WERE REQUIRING IS ELECTRICAL ACCESS ENOUGH OUT OF AN OUTLET SO- I YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL GO BACK TO THAT THE SPONSOR AND- TO GET MORE CLARITY BUT I GREW THEIR CENTERPOINT WILL SEE YOU IN APPROPRIATIONS. YES HOME. I WOULD SOONER SHOW- SO IT'S REALLY. WE JUST STAFF WERE JUST DEBATING IN OUR HOUSE WHAT TYPE OF VEHICLE TO PURCHASE WE NEEDED TO PURCHASE A VEHICLE IN OUR CHILD WAS GOING TO TRY IT AB BACK AND FORTH TO UTAH IN THE THOUGHT HE WANTED TO PURCHASE THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND GREAT SUPPORT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES I WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE FEES SO I UNDERSTAND THE MERITS. OF THE BILL. HOWEVER I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO. MANDATING THAT AB APARTMENT COMPLEXES HAVE THESE BUILT IN PRIOR TO THE I RESPECT AND I AYE. AYE SHE COMMEND THE FACT THAT IT IS. AB LESS EXPENSIVE TO PUT IT IN BEFOREHAND AND AFTERWARDS AB MUCH MUCH LESS SO I RESPECT THAT THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HAVE TO DO MORE WITH- THEY WERE FOCUSING ON THE LECTERN VEHICLES THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE STARTING TO RISE ON. OUT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF THESE- BATTERIES AND WHETHER OR NOT THESE ARE ACTUALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO- YOU KNOW. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A- TO IN A LETTER TO- OIL POWERED VEHICLES BUT- GAS POWERED VEHICLES. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE RISING CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE WITH REGARDS TO THESE BATTERIES AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FOR. FRIENDLY OPTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SO MY CONCERN. WITH THAT IS THAT. BY MANDATING- NEW CONSTRUCTION CALIFORNIA TO ACCOMMODATE THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE- OR IS IT AS A COME AS A I GUESS A COMMODITY COULD BE A- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT NO COMMODITY BUT IF I GO WHAT THE WORD IS EVASIVE. AND- AND THEN I MADE EIGHTY AMENITIES AS AN AMENITY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THE STATE MIGHT BE- UNINTENTIONALLY CREW BEING INNOVATION AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE. TO GAS POWERED VEHICLES- INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR THAT MORE- AB. IN ADDITION TO THAT I'M AND ALSO- YOU KNOW WE JUST TOWARD- A HYDRANT BUT FACILITY IN OUR DISTRICT IN MY TWELVE ACTIONS ON MY DISTRICT MY BORDERING DISTRICT AND- THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN RESEARCH GOING ON WITH WITH THAT SPACE AS WELL- WHICH ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR SO. THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION COMING INTO WITH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE MOVING FORWARD AND IF THE STATE IS GOING TO COME AND JUST SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING WHAT WE'RE PUTTING A VALUE TO THEY WERE PRIORITIZING ELECTRIC VEHICLES INSTEAD OF ALLOWING. PER SE THE AB. I'M JUST A CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURBING THE INNOVATION THAT'S COMING THROUGH- WITH OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION ASIDE FROM FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ALSO CONCERN ON WHETHER OR NOT OUR GRID WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS INCREASE IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT OTHER CUSTOMERS ON THE AGING ELECTRICAL GRID- IS THERE IS. INTERPLAY ON THAT BIGGEST AT. ON THAT END AND- AND- AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO INCREASE INNOVATION IN ALL ALTERNATIVE SECTORS OF TRANSPORTATION AND JUST THIS SORT OF FOCUSING ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT ARE STARTING TO RISE AND MANY MANY PEOPLE TRY TO DISCUSS THAT AND IS A PERMANENT OF LOCAL CONTROL- I BELIEVE THAT EACH MULTI FAMILY COMPLEX OWNER AB SHOULD EVALUATE THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES I WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT INCLUDE- ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS- AND ANY MEASURE THAT POTENTIALLY INCREASES THE COST OF HOUSING IS CONCERNING TO ME. SPECIALS IS WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS SO- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I REALLY DO COMMEND THE MERIT OF TRYING TO INCREASE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY- OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE AND- YOU KNOW. IT IS FIRST I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW. I WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT BUYING AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY FOR MY DAUGHTER TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE THE STATION SO I GET THAT THAT PORTION FOR IT AS WELL. BUT I AM. BUT I AM OVERALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE COMING IN IS SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANNA ENCOURAGE BECAUSE IT MAY UNINTENTIONALLY CURB INNOVATION IN OTHER AREAS. ON THAT SEVEN. YEAH I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TOUCHING UPON SOME OF THE BIG DEBATES THAT ARE HAPPENING IT A. R. B. AND R. CLIMATE WORKING GROUP AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING ALL THESE DISCUSSIONS I KNOW ACTUALLY IN PREPARATION FOR THIS- LINDA. HUTCHINS I WAS ONE WITNESSES OUT AN INTERESTING ANALOGY ON THIS ISSUE I ASSUME. THAT THAT. WE DID YOU WANT TO. DO IT IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE SENATE QUESTION. YEAH JUST A BRIEF. THANK YOU SENATOR RIDLEY PLEASE. OKAY BREAK. UP I REALLY WANTED. TO REALLY GREAT. ABOUT BY THIS YEAR THE END DATE. I WANT TO SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE. I THINK OF REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE SUCH A THING CALLED COLDWATER FLATS. AND THAT MEANS THAT APARTMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE COLD WATER. THE BUILDERS WANT TO SAVE MONEY. AND THEY SEEM TO THINK LOWER INCOME RENTERS COULDN'T AFFORD TO. DEMAND HOT WATER SO THEY BUILT THESE BUILDINGS WITH NO. WITH NO HOT BETTER ACCESS. RESIDENTS HOW TO BOIL THE WATER ON THE STOVE. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN. AND SAID THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. NOT FAIR WE MUST SURE ALL THE OF YOUR- HAVE HOT WATER. BILL IN BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A PART OF COST THE BILL. THAT THAT BECAME. MANY MANY YEARS CITIES WERE FOR RESIDENTS TO HAVE TWO THE WATER ON THE STOVE. THIS AN EQUIVALENT. WHAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE. IT- GAS POWERED CAR INTERSTATE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THEY NEED A PLACE TO CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO PLEASE STOP READING THE BUILDING INDUSTRY TRY TO BILL COLD WATER FLAT AND WALK OUT LOW INCOME NEED THE COLOR FROM ACCESS TO BE CHARGING AT HOME WHERE IT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE. IF I COULD. AGREE THE CAN ABOUT THE CELL ARE PRIOR ONE OVER THE OTHER I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. FOR THREE REASONS BATTERY POWERED ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN FUEL CELL VEHICLES. NUMBER ONE THEY'RE EXTREMELY MORE EFFICIENT. SO THEY ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE FOR EXTRA DRIVERS. AND THEY ARE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO CHARGE DID YOU KNOW THAT IT TAKES ONE TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO INSTALL A HYDROGEN FUEL PUMP. THAT IS A HUGE AMOUNT COMPARED TO THE COST OF THE PHONE WHICH- THANK YOU THANK YOU VEHICLE PARKING. I WOULD AFFECT THEIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. OKAY TERRIFIC DELIVER I'M SORRY TO SOMEONE MOVE THE BILL I CAN'T REMEMBER. OUR MOTION BY CENTER BY CAL SKI- CENTER ON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I WHICH IS CALLED PASSED LONG TIME AGO- IT IS. IT'S LIKE A TEACHER CAUSES ALL PSYCHIC PAIN EVERY TIME AN APARTMENT BUILDING OR CONDO BUILDING GETS BUILT AND THEN. PEOPLE CAN'T CHARGE MTV AND EVEN ALREADY DOES EVERYTHING YEAH HI- EVEN THOUGH- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO. AGGRESSIVELY INVEST IN TRANSIT- BUT WE KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF CLIMATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ONE OF THOSE FOUR THINGS WE CAN DO IS TO HAVE A LOT OF DENSITY NEAR TRANSIT AND JOBS- HAVING A MORE SUSTAINABLE VEHICLE FLEET IS DEFINITELY PART OF THE- SOLUTION AND- IT'S JUST. IF WE REALLY REALLY REALLY MEAN IT WHEN WE SAY THAT WE WANT TO ELECTRIFY RIGHT. TRANSPORTATION PLEA. YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION OF ACTUALLY DOING THAT AND I WILL SAY THAT YOU'RE FOR ME WHERE I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE I LIVE IN IN SACRAMENTO I HAVE. NO ABILITY- TO CHARGE- IS AB AND SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT ONE DO SOMETHING RIVER GIVING SUBSIDIES. AND THEY CAN'T. CHARGE AND THEY HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO DO THAT IS THERE ANYONE THERE WHITE PEOPLE ARE HESITANT TO DO THAT IN THE UPTAKE OF BEEN. ON NOT NEARLY WHAT WE WANT SO THIS IS IMPORTANT AND I SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE- WE HAVE A MOTION AND YOU MAY CLOSE YEAH I THINK YOU. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ALSO MAKE SURE WE REALLY MINIMIZE THE COMPLEXITY FOR BILL FOR- FOR APARTMENT OWNERS AS WELL. AS THAT NEGOTIATION CONTINUES BUT- YOU CAN I CAN SET BETTER- MISTER CHAIR.
