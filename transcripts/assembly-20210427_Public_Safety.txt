THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER LINES THANK YOU. OKAY BRING YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS BUT TO SEE ARE THE- THANK. MISTER KING YES THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF IT IS YOU KNOW PEOPLE PAID THEIR PRICE AND- YOU KNOW- THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES- ISN'T THERE A PROCESS CURRENTLY WHERE THEY CAN EXPUNGE THEIR RECORDS. THERE IS A PROCESS IT'S VERY CONVOLUTED VERY COMPLICATED IN AGAIN TO PUT THE BILL DOES IS IT STREAMLINES THAT PROCESS FOR THEM- WE HAVE A DATABASE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND BY ADDING THEIR NAMES THE DATABASE THE COUNTIES CAN THEN CALL INTO THAT DATABASE TO KNOW WHETHER THEY CAN RELEASED INFORMATION ABOUT SOMETHING. IF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTED TO DO THAT FOR THEMSELVES DIFFICULT TIMES MULTIPLE COURT HEARING SPEND MONEY TO VERY CONVOLUTED IN A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND SOMETHING THAT THEIR ATTORNEY WOULD. I THINK IS PART OF THE PROCESS THERE YOUR ATTORNEY HELPS THEM WHEN. THEY GET WOULD HAVE TAKEN FOUR HUNDRED YES RIGHT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GOT THEM THERE- IS THE DETECTIVE CONCURRENT TO DOING THAT IS. THIS PROCESS. THE PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH TO MAKE THAT RIGHT THAT WRONG RIGHT AGAIN NOT NECESSARY RIGHT. TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE GONE PAST IT. AND IN AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS. PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND NINETY AND IF THEY'RE PUTTING IN IT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RECORD EXPUNGED. THEN THEY- GO OUT AND- AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THEY REMEMBER NEXT TIME THAT. WHY THERE'S A HECK OF A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH IF I WANT THIS OFF MY RECORD. SO THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM GETTING THAT RECORD EXPUNGED AND I'M GOING ON A HITTING JOBS AND DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAD HEARD FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES ON. AND THAT SO- YOU KNOW I'M I'M- OPPOSING BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT- PEOPLE NEED TO. HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE SO THAT THEY REMEMBER NOT TO DO THIS STUFF OR AT LEAST. HAVE A DETERRENT. FROM EVER PARTICIPATING IN THAT KIND OF THING AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR QUIRK. YES SO FOR THOSE OF US A LOT OF RESOURCES YOU CAN PROBABLY GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU I HAVE NO FOR THE LIGHTING YOU AT THIS OKAY NOW IN OPPOSITION LARRY MORSE ONLINE. YES SIR GERMAN- THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LEARN MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN THE SHUFFLE UP ROOM TO AB FIFTEEN FORTY UNLESS AMENDED AS DRAFTED THE BILL REPRESENTS A DE FACTO MANDATE TO RE SENTENCE REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES OUR ISSUE WITH THE BUILDERS OF THAT FIRES THE COR TO SCHEDULE A CONFERENCE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL. ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY IS FUNDAMENTAL ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT IN VALUE EIGHTY QUEST FOR RESENTENCING THE BILL ESTABLISHES A VERY HIGH STANDARD TO SORT OUT FOR STANDARD FAVORING RECALL AND RE SENTENCING OF THE DEFENDANT WHICH MAY ONLY BE OVERCOME IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE DEFENDANT POSES AN UNREASONABLE RISK PUBLIC EIGHT FEET BECAUSE THE COURT DETERMINES THE DEFENDANT WOULD LIKELY COME AT A SO CALLED SUPER STRIKE A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF VIOLENT OFFENSES SET FORTH UNDER SUBSECTION OF PENAL CODE SECTION SIX SIX SEVEN. REQUIRING JUDGES TO IN EFFECT MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT FUTURE CRIMINAL CONDUCT IN EVALUATING SUITABILITY FOR RESENTENCING IS FANCIFUL AT WORST AND UNWORKABLE IT BASS MOREOVER THIS PRODUCTION IS UNNECESSARY UNDER CURRENT LAW AND THE PROPOSED BILL JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION TO CONSIDER JUDICIAL COUNCIL RULES AND THE JUDGE SENTENCES IN AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE UNIFORMITY IN SENTENCING AND CONFORMITY WITH CHANGES IN SENTENCING LAW. OUR OTHER MAIN CONCERNS THAT THE BILL ALLOWS THE COURT TO LITERALLY CHANGE THE CHARGES FOR WHICH A PERSON WAS TRIED AND CONVICTED IN ORDER TO REDUCE SENTENCES IT WOULD ALLOW THE COURT TO VACATE A CONVICTION AND IMPOSED JUDGMENT ON DIFFERENT CRIMES SO CALLED LESSER INCLUDED AND LESSER RELATED OFFENSES SUCH A CHANGE WOULD CONTRAVENE THE DA'S CHARGING DECISION AND THE JURY'S VERDICT AND IS VERY LIKELY AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL INTRUSION INTO EXECUTIVE BRANCH FUNCTIONS. FURTHERMORE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT MUST WILL LAY OF. ARE NOT. WITHOUT THAT CAN OF PART. SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL THERE'S NO MENTION IN THE BILL OF THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS THE NOTICED AND GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD DURING CONSIDERATION OF A RESENTENCING CONTEST. AND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED REVISIONS REQUIRED IN EXPEDITED PROCESS WE'RE HEARING ALREADY AUTHORIZED UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY. OR THE TIMELY APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL. BUT THIS BILL AS DRAFTED ABROGATE DECISIONS OF PROSECUTORS AND JURIES AND CREATES A FAMILY FALL FLAWED PROCESS FOR GRANTING RELIEF. BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON JUDICIAL PREDICTIONS PLEASE REASONABLY ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED SPECIFICALLY BY ONE. ELIMINATING THE UNNECESSARY PRODUCTION IN FAVOR RESENTENCING TRUE INCLUDING A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES ALL PARTIES TO AGREE TO ANY CHANGE IN CHARGES AND THREE INCLUDING LANGUAGE GUARANTEEING VICTIMS RIGHT TO BE HEARD. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING'S WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD TO REACHING A COMPROMISE THANKS. SIR THANK YOU SIR.

DUE TO- PRO CRIME POLICIES SET FORTH BY SEVERAL DIFFICULT POLITICIAN. YOU THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU- BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER CORK. MR LACKEY- I FIND VERY LITTLE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN YOUR BILL AND THE WAY THE DA'S DESCRIBED IT- I THINK THAT YOUR BILL DOES ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER ALL SORTS OF THINGS- AND RESENTENCING COULD MEAN IT GOES FROM A LIFE IMPRISONMENT TO THIRTY YEARS IN THE GUY HAS DONE MORE TO SERVE. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND OR PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME THAT TO- THAT I'M CORRECT IN THAT THE DA'S DESCRIPTION IS NOT ACCURATE WHAT WE'LL GET OUT YOUR POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING WITH- THE DA'S ASSOCIATION I THINK THEY DO- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO CONVERSE TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK BAD AYE I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH I THINK YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE BILL. AND IT AGAIN THE BILL IS. STEMMING FROM THE COMMISSION- THE COMMITTEE TO REVISE THE PENAL CODE WHICH AGAIN THIS IS THEIR THIS IS THEIR RECOMMENDATION IN THIS IS ALSO A WAY TO. STREAMLINE THE TWO THOUSAND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT OF C. D. C. R. THEY THEY THEY RECOMMEND THESE OTHER DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS OWN RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY. HAVE STALLED WITHIN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU COULD YOU MAYBE. THANK YOU COULD YOU MAKE ME A CO OP SALUTE THANK YOU. MR LACKEY. YEAH I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT APPARENTLY THIS RESENTENCING ACCORDING TO YOUR BILL A COULD BE GRANTED WITHOUT. CONSULTING HAVING ANY KIND OF HEARING A CONSULTING VICTIMS. AND THAT WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THE VICTIM WRITES AN ARTICLE ONE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT. I'M GONNA ASK MR TADA TO ADDRESS THAT. QUESTION- FOR STATEMENT. SURE I'M HAPPY TO THANK YOU- THAT IS NOT CORRECT- WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND IT'S OUR DUTY TO ENFORCE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND VICTIMS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD- AT ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING A CASE THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED IN AND MY OFFICE AS I'M SURE ALL OFFICES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ABIDE BY THAT CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. TO NOTIFY ANY VICTIM OF ANY CRIME WHEN THERE'S A HEARING OF THIS TYPE THAT INVOLVES RESENTENCING. THAT'S JUST A CONFLICT OF INFORMATION I'VE BEEN PROVIDED SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS CURRENT YOU MAY CLOSE AGAIN LET LET ME JUST THINK THE CHAIR FOR HELPING ME OUT AND ALLOW ME TO GO FIRST- WE THINK THAT THIS- THIS IS REALLY A SMART JUSTICE THE PROPOSAL WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO CODIFY WHAT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AFTER A REAL NOT REALLY MONTHS OF DELIBERATION AND JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE FOR A BI FIFTY FOUR.

THANK YOU I WON'T GET INTO THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL DOES BECAUSE WE DO HAVE WITNESSES AND I DON'T WANNA BE REDUNDANT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I THINK WE HAVE- KANTOR'S ALERT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON THE LINE. DO WE ALSO HAVE. LOCKS GRANT. CHILD ABUSE YES WE ARE ALSO IN A LONG LINE. IT OPERATE COULD OPEN UP THE WITNESS LICENSE. THANK YOU BOTH PLANES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON KENDRA DOLLARS HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA'S VERY PROUD TO BE A SPONSOR OF EIGHTY FIVE OR SIX AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS MEASURE. WE APPRECIATE NINE EIGHTY FIVE A SIX THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE POEM PLAN I CALLED MADE YOU FEEL MORE ISOLATED THAN EVER MAKING THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHILD ABUSE. RECENT LITIGATION HAS ALSO SHED LIGHT ON NOT ONLY THE IF YOU TEACH YOU SUCH AS OCCURRED IN YOUR ORGANIZATION BUT THE FAILURE OF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT A FINE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MEASURES SUCH AS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND MANDATED REPORTER TRAINING. CONSEQUENTLY LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DROPPING THE BAD ACTOR YOU ORGANIZATIONS FROM COVERAGE ALLEGING THAT THESE PARTICULAR YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS FAILED TO INFORM THEIR ENSURES THAT SUCH WIDESPREAD USE THAT IN SOME CASES THE COST BY THE YOUTH ORGANIZATION- LACK OF OVERSIGHT. SUN NEWS ORGAN. HAVE OR ADOPTED INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES WHICH ARE PROVEN TO HELP PREVENT THE OF CHILDREN. BY HELPING TO. AT THE STATE PRACTICES ALSO LA PHILIP RESCUE YOU CHECK THAT THE ORGANIZED. WHICH CAN PROVIDE MORE ASSURANCE OF SOVEREIGNTY TO THE INSURER. HOWEVER IF YOU COTINUE TO JOIN YOU ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE SLOWLY RETURNING AND PERSON FUNCTION. THERE'S STILL A LACK OF UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR THE PREVENTION OF THE USE AND ORGANIZATIONS. EIGHTY FIVE SX WOULD GUARANTEE YOU ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PROACTIVE MEASURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT INCIDENTS OF ABUSE ARE CAUGHT EARLY ON. IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY ALLOWING LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANY J. YOU IDEAS ORGANIZATION COMPLIANCE. WITH THE STANDARDS PRIOR TO ISSUING ANY INSURANCE POLICY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE. MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WEEK HELLO. IT THERE WITH THE PUBLIC EIGHT EIGHT. MY NAME IS WALKING AND I AM A VICTIM OF INSTITUTIONAL IS AT AND THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC CHILDREN TALKING.

I AM HERE TO SUPPORT AB FIVE OH THANK WITH REQUIRE YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT SACRIFICE HOW THE NEW PREVENTIVE MEASURES. AND WOULD ALSO REQUIRE SPECIFIED VOLUNTEERS AND YOUTH ORGANIZATION TO BE MANDATED REPORTERS THERE ARE MANY WIDELY STUDIED BLACK REPORTS THAT SHOW HOW TRAINING FOR REFUSING GROOMING AWARENESS COMBINED WITH THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF FAILURE TO MANDATE REPORT. COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION. BUT I AM NOT THAT SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIM AND CHILD ABUSE ACT BURKE I AM ALSO A MOM. BEING A SURVIVOR AND A MOM BUT WE. GET GREAT.

I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU BRING IT NOW BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR BARKEVIOUS. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT A LOT OF YOU KNOW AS PARENTS WE BOTH KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COACH OUR KIDS IN OUR IN OUR KIDS LIVES ARE VOLUNTEERS- AND THEY DO NOT A GOOD AS THEIR HEART BUT HAVING THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDED IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW THERE WAS SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE OVER BREADTH OF THIS OBVIOUSLY THOSE PEOPLE IT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW. BUT AB IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVING IN FUNCTIONS THAT ACTUALLY TRADITIONALLY ARE ARE MANDATED REPORTERS RATHER THAN THE PERSON WORKS AT THE SNACK SHACK AT THE- SOCCER GAME HE WELL- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE EXAMPLE YOU USED BECAUSE THAT MIGHT NOT FOR I MEAN THAT STILL MAY BE A MANDATORY REPORTER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- SO I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT I'M SPEAKING TO THAT EXACT EXAMPLE WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PTA IN PARTICULAR- ABOUT- IT'S NOT WE FOCUSED ON THE HOURS THAT A VOLUNTEER SERVES IN ORDER TO NOT BE OVERBROAD. BUT THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY USED SERVING THAT DON'T ACTUALLY- COME INTO PLAY WITH THE U. S. WHICH IS KIND OF BIZARRE SO WE WILL TIGHTEN UP THAT AND ENSURE THAT WE- NARROW THE SCOPE IN THAT SENSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THOUGH IS THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN IN THE SNAPSHOT MAY BE AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY THINK OF THEM AS YOU SERVING OF BUT PERHAPS THERE'S KIDS WHO ARE HELPING IN THE SNAPSHOT AND SO- IT I'M THINKING MY KIDS BASEBALL GAME RIGHT THE PARENT DOESN'T DO THE TIME. AND THIS TAX. ANYONE HAS AND LITTLE LEAGUE UNDERSTAND THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO SERVE. THEM BUT MAYBE THE KID DOES AN OLDER KID AND WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT IS WHEN THEY HAVE THAT ONE ON ONE CONTACT WITH OUT OTHER SUPERVISION IF IT'S FOR PROLONGED. AMOUNTS OF TIMES THAT THEY ARE NUMBER ONE TRAINED AS MANDATORY REPORTERS AND BACKGROUND CHECKED I MEAN THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS SOUTH. YES WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE- THAT IT'S NARROW ENOUGH THAT WE'RE NOT INCLUDING. SOMEBODY WHO SHOWS UP TO THE PTA BAKE SALE- IN IS NOT INTERACTING WITH THE CHILD ON THEIR OWN BUT NOT QUITE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL IN HOW WE DO IT. FOR PATIENTS AND I REPORTS WARNING ABOUT THINKING. THANK YOU. YES MRS HERE TO. SO THIS IS A BILL OF THE WE REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT INVOLVES CHILD ABUSE AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU IS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT WOULD BE THE MINIMUM AGE CONSIDERED TO BE A VOLUNTEER THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN. YEAH BECAUSE I THINK OF PLACES LIKE THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND I THINK OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER CLANS WHERE THEY DO. HAVE A LOT OF- YOUNG VOLUNTEERS THEY'RE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE OR- IN THAT RANGE. AND HOW ILL EQUIPPED THEY ARE. TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHEN SOMETHING IS WRONG SO THEY GET THIS TRAINING WHICH CONSISTS OF HOW MANY HOURS. I BELIEVE IT'S FOR THE WITH THE RECOMMENDED TRAINING I BELIEVE IS TWO HOURS OKAY. SERVICE SOME PEOPLE. GET MASTERS AND DOCTORATES IN THINGS LIKE THIS AND THEY STILL HAVE A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THE LIABILITY PLACED ON A VOLUNTEER PERSON ON MAKING MONEY DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO WHAT CAN BE A WRONG. A WRONG FULL REPORTING. IN A WRONGFUL REPORTING ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT YOU KNOW AS YOU AS YOU KNOW IS WHEN. SOMEBODY GET CPS ON SOMEBODY I MEAN ON A ON A PARENT. WHEN THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING THERE- THEY IN OTHER WORDS THEY MISINTERPRET SOME OF THE CLUES THAT THEY MAY BE TAUGHT YOU KNOW ACCEPT BRUISES. THINGS LIKE THAT I WAS A MANDATORY REPORTER MYSELF OBVIOUSLY AND- WE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT SOMETIMES WE GO IN THE HOUSE AND WE LOOK AROUND AND GO. ONE WAY YOU KNOW WE'RE ABOUT TO SEND THESE PARENTS LIFE INTO HELL FORMER. WHAT WE THINK IS AN ABUSE SITUATION. I CAN'T IMAGINE PLACE IN THAT ON A YOUNG VOLUNTEER SO I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD SOMEHOW HAVE THIS BE A BILL WHERE THOSE VOLUNTEERS ARE GIVEN THE TRAINING THE BASIC TRAINING. AND THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS TO HAVE THOSE VOLUNTEERS REPORT TO A MANDATORY REPORTER IN THAT SYSTEM THAT HEY I SUSPECT THIS SO THAT THAT MANDATORY REPORTING IS ACTUALLY DONE BY. AT IT'S AN ADULT THAT IS PAID THAT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I WAS PAID FOR TO DO THAT. AND THEREFORE PROTECTING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THOUGH NOT ONLY POTENTIAL LIABILITY BUT I I'VE SEEN A FEW OF THESE ANGRY PARENTS. WHO COME AND SAY HEY WHAT WHAT'S WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED I SENT MY KID HERE NEXT THING YOU KNOW I GOT CPS. COME BRING THEM DOWN MY THROAT I CAN'T GET MY KIDS BACK. IT'S A NIGHTMARE FOR SOME PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS THAT'S THE TRADE OFF. BUT I SOMEHOW WANT C. THAT TRANSFERRED TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY THE ADULTS IN CHARGE. SO THIS THAT'S JUST MY STRUGGLE WITH IT SURE HAVING A HARD TIME NOT SUPPORTING AND BACKING AND NOT I'M NOT GONNA BONDS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS A RESULT OF IN FACT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND THE BOY SCOUTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHITE BOY SCOUT NINETY THOUSAND CASES PRIMARILY BY VOLUNTEERS OF ABUSE AND NO REPORTING WHATSOEVER BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB- THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED CASES AND THEY FOUND THAT DESPITE INTERNAL POLICIES THEY WERE DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THEIR END OWN EMPLOYEES. SO THIS IS SET IN FACT TO NOT HAVE THE VOTE THE LONG TERM VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A CASUAL VOLUNTEER RATES SIXTEEN HOURS IN A MONTH OR THIRTY TWO FOR THE YEAR A LONG TERM VOLUNTEERS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY IF WE HAD LET THE LAW. JUST ALLOW- USEFUL IT'S NOT USEFUL IN TEARS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OVER EIGHTEEN BECAUSE IT DOES GET TRICKY UNDER EIGHTEEN BUT OVER EIGHTEEN TO SIMPLY TELL- SOMEBODY AT THE INSTITUTION THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT IN ALL OF THESE CASES IT WAS SOMEBODY AT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF THAT WAS WAS PERPETRATING THE ABUSE. AND THIS IS REALLY GEARED TOWARDS CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE IN INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE CHILDREN- SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD THAT CALLS- THAT THAT REPORTS TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T SUBJECT TO LIABILITY I IN AND IT'S NOT IN THEIR HANDS WHETHER OR NOT. THE LAN PORTS AND HAS TO DEAL WITH CPS IN THE RESULT OF C. P. S. U. YOU WERE PROBABLY IN A DIFFERENT SPOT SO- I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH UNDER EIGHTEEN FOR VARIETY REASONS I'M NOT SURE THAT THE COMPREHENSION- WOULD BE COMPLETE. AND SO IN FOR THE MOST PART WE DON'T HAVE UNDER EIGHTEEN VOLUNTEERS WERE VOLUNTEERING THAT MUCH AT THESE INSTITUTIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE IS ALSO APPEARED OF TIME WHEN WE DO HAVE PREDATORS- AND I HATE TO SAY THAT PEOPLE GET REALLY ANGRY WHEN I USE THE WORD PREDATORS BUT PREDATORS. UTILIZE THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS A GROUNDS TO GROOM AND- SELECT CHILDREN TO ABUSE SO. I UNDERSTAND IT I PERSONALLY AS A MOM- AS- SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN WORK IN CHILD- ABUSE ISSUES NOW FOR. MY ENTIRE TIME HERE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS- ERR ON THE SIDE OF CHILDREN AND PROTECTING CHILDREN AND SO IT IS. IN IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED ON CPS WHAT WHEN THE BIG ISSUES IS BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES ARE VIEWED AS ABUSERS OF CHILDREN MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN WHITE FAMILIES. AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TARGETING CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT HAS OVERWHELMINGLY HAPPENED AT INSTITUTION SERVING CHILDREN- AND- WE HAVE THE PROOF OF EVAN BY VOLUNTEERS OR VOLUNTEERS WHO KNEW IT WAS GOING ON AND DIDN'T SPEAK UP WE NEED TO- TIGHTEN IT UP. RIGHT AND I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT I JUST I LOOK AT THE OTHER PART WHICH IS CHAIR. YOU KNOW FOR ME MANDATORY REPORTING IS WHEN YOU GO AND YOU SEE SOME KID WITH THAT BUNCH OF BRUISES ON ON. THAT YOU NEED TO LOW. NOTIFIED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFY C. P. S. R. C. P. S. AND- AND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERNAL ABUSE- IN WITHIN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PART SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THE- CLARIFICATIONS IN THE CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY. ONE ELSE COME MISTER CORK. WITH REGARD TO P. T. HEY I WAS A PTA PRESIDENT AND I WAS. NEVER WORKED WITH YOU. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO. HI IN A TEN HOUR EVERY WEEK IN THE CLASSROOM- SO I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN PTA WHO SHOULD COME UNDER THIS. WORKS OUT MUCH IN THE CLASSROOM- AND- I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE PTA IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE OUT OF IT ALTOGETHER. OR JUST OUT OF IT- EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK A LOT WITH KIDS CAN YOU STATE WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION ON MY UNDERSTANDING IS SO- I I'M I'M TO GIVE MY OWN. EXAMPLES OF MY INVOLVEMENT OF PTA SO ONE YEAR I WAS TO THE PTA PARENT TO PARENT CLASSROOM PARENTS FOR MY DAUGHTER IN THIRD GRADE AND SHE BIG MAY NEVER BE CLASSROOM POUND AGAIN- I'M APPARENTLY VERY CONTROLLING. THAT IN THAT CASE I AM IN THE CLASSROOM I JUST SAW A SIDE NOTE THAT COULD IMAGINE- SO IN THAT CASE I'M IN IN THE CLASSROOM EVERY SINGLE% WEEK SOMETIMES TWICE A WEEK FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOURS RIGHT DIRECT- DIRECT INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CHILDREN SOMETIMES UNSUPERVISED YOU KNOW THERE THERE WERE. ISSUES IN WHICH I SHOULD HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK BY THE WAY I DID AND- AND MORE THAN I THINK THE ONLY THING I HAD TO HAVE WAS A TB TEST. SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A. LITTLE PROBLEM THERE RIGHT- THE OTHER SIDE. IS AS I COULD NO LONGER BE A ROOM HERE BECAUSE MY CHILD DISQUALIFIED ME. I'M INVOLVED IN PTA BUT I AM THE CASUAL VOLUNTEER MAYBE EVEN MONTHLY VOLUNTEER BUT I'M JUST SELLING PIZZA. AT THE KIDS SCHOOL ON FRIDAYS IN THE AFTERNOON AS A FUNDRAISER SO I'M HAVING CONTACT I'M NOT HAVING DIRECT CONTACT. OR INDIVIDUALIZED CONTACT AND WE NEED THOSE VOLUNTEERS TO BE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR. BIG SALES AND SOMETIMES PTA VOLUNTEERS IT COULD WE DON'T WANNA LABEL THE PTA AS A CHILD SERVING ORGANIZATION WHEN SOME PTA MEMBERS WHO DO A LOT OF STUFF NEVER ACTUALLY EVEN INTERACT WITH THE CHILDREN. SO WHAT WE NEED TO. I THINK WHAT PJ'S CONCERNS ARE WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP HOW WE WHO IN THEIR ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN NONE OF THEM WOULD BE SUBJECT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S FINE THANK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. EIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE. FORTY TWO OH TWO. HOW ARE YOU TODAY OKAY NOW YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO I ADDED MYSELF AS A- REJECT US. AREN'T IN THE CLASSROOM FOR MY KIDS BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK EVERYTHING ELSE I SAID MAKES SENSE TO PEOPLE AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT CHILDREN. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. THANK YOU FOR TOO MANY AND I CALL THE ROLL. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON EIGHTY FIVE OH SIX BY NOT ENOUGH GONZALEZ THEM MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI BLACKIE AND BARRICADE IN CORK. CORK ACCENT IAGO. C. R. TO. HI SEE OUR TOP FIVE WICKS LI LI I THE MEASURE PASSES MISTER COOLEY EIGHT NUMBERS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN A. B. TWELVE FORTY FIVE COOLEY RESENTENCING. HOLLY'S GOOD AFTERNOON I AM PLEASED TO BRING THIS BILL TO IT IS. A KIM TO MISTER TANKS FIFTEEN FORTY SECOND LOOK SENTENCING BILL. AND- FOR THE SENATE TO PROBE IS TO BE IN THIS COMMITTEE I WAS ADMITTED TO THE BAR EIGHTY FOUR BUT I NEVER PRACTICE- CRIMINAL LAW. AND THIS ISSUE HAS OFTEN MADE ME GET. AND ACROSS SPACE GREG ALWAYS THINK YOU IN YOUR SHOP WHEN THESE ISSUES COME UP. FAR BEYOND MY EXPERIENCE SO CONGRATULATIONS. ON THIS BILL COMES OUT OF MY DISTRICT IT COMES OUT OF MY LIFE IN THAT I HAD A CONSTITUENT AND RICK CAME- BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION A GENTLEMAN NAMED QUENTIN WATTS WHO HAD BEEN SENTENCED. FOUR HE WAS A DRIVER AND A BUS. GOING TO THE COLUSA CASINO. THAT WAS IN A TERRIBLE AUTO ACCIDENT ELEVEN PEOPLE DIED TWENTY ONE WERE INJURED. AND TRIED IN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTY IS AFRICAN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN. WHO HAD A HISTORY OF. SEIZURES BUT THE SEIZURES ISSUES NEVER CAME OUT IN THE TRIAL. YOU SUGGEST THAT MAYBE HE HADN'T GOT SUFFICIENT SLEEP EAT LETTUCE DIABETES GET OUT OF CONTROL. ELEVEN HE WAS SENTENCED. TWO OF TWENTY SIX YEARS TO LIFE. AND THERE WAS A CASE OF. THE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES COUPLE SOME BOTTLE AND- SO SEVERE. A PART BY TERM OF ART- GREAT BODILY INJURY ENHANCEMENT ALSO APPLIED. AND LEAD TO THE SEVERITY OF HIS SENTENCE. I GOT INTERESTED WHEN I REALIZE THAT- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAD ISSUED A RULING IN PEOPLE VERSUS COOK THE SELLING THIS FACT PATTERN THESE GREAT ALL ENHANCES COULD ACTUALLY BE APPLIED IN SEVEN SEASONS AS A HEAD OF A CLINTON WHAT'S- AND THE LONG STORY IS I STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS I ACTUALLY WROTE MY FIRST LETTER TO GOVERNOR BROWN. IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN HI THIS IS MAGGIE AND I'M CALLING STUDENT LOAN RELIEF HI. ASKING THAT HE WOULD- COMMUTE. WHAT WHAT'S THE SENTENCE I WROTE AGAIN TO GOVERNOR KNEW SOMEONE THAT DIDN'T PRODUCE A RESULT- BUT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN QUITE A LOT SAID I'D HAVE TO SAY ADVOCATE AND OTHERS. ALL I WAS A SUPPORTER IN THIS BUT NOT IN THE VANGUARD ACTUALLY. OF CDC AND OTHERS REALLY EXAMINE THIS SITUATION A SAP WILL BE PROVIDED A GREAT DEAL OF COVERAGE OF A WRITER JASON PAUL. AND EVENTUALLY A LETTER WENT TO THE COURT ASKING THEM TO REVISIT THIS CASE THEY DID REVISIT THE CASE THEY LOPPED OFF YEARS OFF A SENTENCE AND COULDN'T WATCH WAS RELEASED NINE DAYS LATER THE BILL- CIRCUIT SO I DO BELIEVE IN THIS IDEA THAT THERE CAN BE FACTUAL SITUATIONS THAT WARRANT SECOND LOOK SENTENCING. AND I THINK THEY I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS BUT I ACTUALLY THINK IT IS AN AREA OF THE LAW THAT WILL LOOK AT AS MY BILL PROPOSES AS I KNOW MR TANG IN A MORE PURPOSIVE LIFE SO I REQUEST YOUR RIVAL. ON BEHALF OF AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU MR COOLEY I SEE. YOU HAVE NO PLAN WITNESSES AND I'LL GO TO A FORTY TWO OH TWO ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE COOLEY.

HELLO HI YOU YES HE. OKAY HI GOOD AFTERNOON- BENEATH THE HEART WITH THE LOOK ON VALLEY PEOPLE AGAIN WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND I SEE ON HERE I HAVE. MITCH VILLACH COULD TELL FROM THE ASSAULT TREASURER FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ON THE FONG. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR- MISTER CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME- YEAH PERFECTLY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SIR. IT'S A GERMAN JOINT SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE MY NAME IS MADE YOU FELT COULD TELL TREASURE OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO WITH THE ADDITION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. IT'S RETURNS SO SEE ASIAN AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF AB TOLD FORTY FIVE MINUTES AMEND. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW YOU TO. INCARCERATED FOR SEARS VIOLENCE FENCES. ON THEIR OWN BEHALF RECALL THEIR SENSE EVEN SENATE IMPOSED AS PART OF A PLEA BARGAIN. I WOULD FORCE THE COURT IMPORT STANDARD THAT WOULD GUARANTEE THAT ALL SUCH PETITIONS MUST BE GRANTED REGARDLESS OF THE INMATES CRIME THIS GREAT RECORD CONTINUING CRIMINAL CONDUCT WHILE INCARCERATED. PARTICIPATION IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS OR POST RELEASED REENTRY PLANS ARE THREE CONCERNS ARE AS FOLLOWS FIRST. RT OF PETITIONS TO RECALL AT THE END AFTER CONDUCTING A REVIEW OF THE MERIT BASED FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT. AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE ALLOWS ANY INMATES TO PETITION THE COURT FOR RESENTENCING. THE MOST VIOLENT OFFENSES. HUMAN INCLUDING CONTINUOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD HOMICIDES INVOLVING GUN VIOLENCE WITHOUT ANY CRITERIA ANY VETTING ALREADY SCREENING. THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE COSTLY AND BURDENSOME TO THE COURT SYSTEM JUST LOOKING AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DESCRIPTIONS OFFICE IS REVIEWING CASES PURSUANT TO THE CURRENT STATURE. RECENT GDPR INFORMATION INDICATE THERE ARE NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR INCARCERATED PERCENT ORIGINATING FROM L. A. COUNTY FIRST SERVED AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS. THEY ALL WILL BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY PETITION THE COURT WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE RECORD. OTHER FACTORS TO REFLECT ON THEIR SUITABILITY TO REENTER SOCIETY. THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD TO MOST OF THEM HAVE ALREADY PETITIONED UNDER PREVIOUS LEGISLATION EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT ELIGIBLE. INCARCERATED PERSONS YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED WHICH RETHINKING STATUTE APPLIES TO DUCK. IT IS EASIER TO PETITION THE COURTS WILL ON THAT. THIRD PARTIES ARE PETITIONING ON THEIR BEHALF IN THE CURRENT STATUTE THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT IF ADDITION. AND HOW DID THE COURTS BURDEN IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COURT ACT ON THE PETITION WITHIN NINETY DAYS. OF THE PETITION HAVING BEEN FILED. THIS IS UNREASONABLE CONSIDERING THE COURTS ARE NOT ONLY REVIEWING PETITIONS UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE. ALSO REVIEWING GAVE ITS CORPUS PETITION AND OTHER RESENDIZ RESENDIZ ADDITION UNDER OTHER GILBERT SECTION. SECOND SPECIFIC ONLY TO FEED YOUR PETITION AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE. DEPARTS FROM AMERICA EIGHT THOUSAND TO A BAKED IN A MARKET THAT'S EXCEPTIONAL REHABILITATION. IT UNKNOWN WHITE HE DID YOUR PETITIONS ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN THIS BILL THE OTHER PETITIONERS. IT BILL PROVIDES NO CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR CDC ARE TO ENSURE. HERE'S UNIFORMITY IN SENTENCING. THE PEOPLE HOULD KNOW WHAT DEFINES EXCEPTIONAL REHABILITATION. HOW THE MEASURE WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD OF YOURS AND- ACTIVITY TO DETERMINE EXCEPTIONAL REHABILITATION. OKAY TYPES BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY SINCE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS SHOULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE CRIME- GRAMMY NEED IN A CHILD ABUSE CASE IS DIFFERENT THAN A SPECIAL SOCKET. GIVE UNCERTAINTY AND BIRD BALLS WILL CREATE DISPARITY OF SENTENCE RATHER THAN ELIMINATE. OF GREAT CONCERN IS THE SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF TWENTY IMPOSSIBLE TO REBUT STANDARD REQUIRES THE COURT TO GRANT EVERY PETITION UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT THE DEFENDANT IS QUITE LIKELY TO COMMIT A FUTURE VIOLENT CRIME. IT'S CREATE THE DE FACTO MANDATE TO REACH SENSE REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IT REQUIRED THE IMPOSSIBLE. THE BILL LEADING TO NOT ONLY ACTUALLY PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT TO DO SO BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IT'LL BE NEVER. BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE FUTURE CONDUCT OF ANY HUMAN BEING BECAUSE NO HUMAN BUT THAT'S THE SUCH ABILITY. MOREOVER THE PROPOSED STANDARD ONLY CONTEMPLATES THE COMMISSION OF A FUTURE VIOLENT CRIME. DESPITE DEFINITION PRECLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE INMATE WILL BE COMMIT FUTURE NONVIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE. ELDER ABUSE EIGHT CRIME RATE BY INTOXICATION OR CHILD MOLESTATION. WE THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASSURED THAT INCARCERATED PERSON HAD BEEN REHABILITATED FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY NOT FOR COMMITTING CERTAIN CRIMES BUT ALL CRIMES THAT IS REHABILITATION. TO EXCLUDE MOST CRIMES IN THE BILL DOES NOT BRING CONFIDENCE AND YET THAT'S BEEN INCARCERATED PERSON IS EXCEPTIONALLY REHABILITATED. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT IS EXCEPTIONAL. IT DOESN'T MERELY A MECHANISM FOR YOU COULD BE OUR TO RELEASE MORE INCARCERATED PERSONS ON CHALLENGED IT LACKS YOU CONCERN FOR THE PUBLIC AND EVEN THE INCARCERATED PERSON. IS THE PERSON THAT UP TO SIXTY CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE IT'S- THOUSAND FORTY YOU. NEED TO WRAP UP YOUR BY MISSOURI. I JUST WANT TO SAY THE THIRD AT THE OUR CONCERN IS THE PROSECUTION AND COURT FROM THE DRYING THERE ENDED THERE- THE RIDGE OF THE AGREEMENT WHEN RESENTENCED GRANTED. WITH LEGAL DUE TO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AND LASTLY IN EVEN IF IT COMES ARE NOTIFIED OUR VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS BE MEANINGLESS IF THERE IS THE FACT AMENDED TO READ SENSE WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE PUBLIC IN VICTIMS OF CRIME- AT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION STATE FIGURES THE CRIMES ARE ENTITLED TO FIND OUT IN THE CRIMINAL CASES THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NOW WITH WILL LOOK INTO THE- IDEAS FOR ANY. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE MISTER COOLEY C. NONE WILL GO TO THE TELECONFERENCE SAME QUESTION SEEN NONE OPERATOR COULD YOU OPEN UP FOR A. B. TWELVE FORTY FIVE COOLEY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE FORTY FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MRS QUIRK- SO WE JUST HEARD MR SPELL- I WOULD HOPE THAT- BEFORE. EITHER BILL COMES TO THE FLOOR THAT THE TWO OF YOU WORK ON ONE BILL. AND RIGHT NOW I THINK- MISTER TING'S BILL IS SOMEWHAT MORE ADVANCED IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF DETAIL- SO I PREFER THAT ONE AT THE MOMENT BUT I HOPE YOU TWO CAN WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS SHARE TO. MR LACKEY K- THANK YOU MR COOLEY FOR YOUR BILL. SO ONE OF THINGS I'M I HAVE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PART OF THIS YOU'VE ACTUALLY CREATED A FOR OUR THEBILL ACTUALLY HAS CREATED A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO DO RESENTENCING WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CALCULATE SAVINGS AND THEN DISTRIBUTED OUT TO THE DA'S OFFICE AND THESE DIFFERENT THINGS IS THAT TRUE. IS THAT PART OF THE BILL. I'M NOT I THINK THAT SOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF HOW THE BILL OPERATOR STUDY. FORMAL IT'S NOT PART OF THE BILL. BECAUSE IN AND OUT I CAN I CAN TAKE IT UP WITH YOU LATER- THANK YOU IT YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT. IN MY FEW SHORT MONTHS HERE- YEAH WE CAN DO THOSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES- FOR LIKE AN PROPERTY CONFISCATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO THAT IS PART OF THIS BILL- IT THAT CREATES I THINK THAT SAME KIND OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST ARGUMENT. THAT I'VE HEARD FOR OTHER SITUATIONS YEAH IN LAW AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY. I WILL SAY THIS I ACTUALLY THINK THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AN INTENTION OKAY IN THE BILL. I THINK THAT'S FOR A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS A IS A RIGHT ISSUE TO RAISE. HI I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME PLACE THAT THIS POLICY. OF SECOND LOOK SINCE HE WILL LAND. I PERSONALLY- I APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION WITH A COMMA TO WORK WITH ME I SEE MYSELF WORK WITH THEM RIGHT WERE THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. AND- AS I SAY THIS PARTICULAR BILL GROWS OUT OF MY OWN INVOLVEMENT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE- HAVING FOLLOWED IT THROUGH A COUPLE OF GOVERNORS- SO. YEAH I APPRECIATE YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT AN OBJECT OF MY BILL HI I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION BUT I HOPE YOU LOOK INTO THAT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FLOOR YES INDEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CLARK. JUST TO READ FROM YOU AND MAIL. PART IN THE FINANCIAL CALCULATE THE SAVINGS ACCRUED FROM RESENTENCING DEFENDANT. PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION- AND UPON. APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE 25% OF THE SAVINGS WILL BE GO TO THE DA. TWELVE POINT 5% TO SUPERIOR COURT. AND TWELVE POINT 5% TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. THANK YOU MR LACKEY YEAH THE CASE YOU CITED IS CLEARLY WORTHY OF. NEVADA CáC THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT THERE THERE'S SOME OTHER CONCERNS WERE WITH THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED AT LEAST MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT. ONE OF THE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WAS EXPRESSED BY- MISTER SHARP THOUGH BUT- SECONDLY I THINK THAT IT CREATES THE PRESUMPTION THAT SAW. IT'S QUITE- UNFAIR THE REQUIREMENT FOR PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT THE DEFENDANT IS LIKELY TO OUT FOR. BY LIKE. I THINK THAT'S A- HUGE STEP IT'S FAIRLY REASON. AND IT'S KIND OF A DEFECT ON THE- SINCE TO ME DOESN'T SEEM. LIKE IT'S AN OBJECT CRITERIA. THAT'S ALL THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION WITH THIS BILL OKAY THANK YOU HELLO THANK YOU ANY OTHER. CHRIS COMMENT YOU MAY CLOSE THE SCHOOL. MOVING FORWARD I DEFINITELY INTEND TO BE WORKING WITH D. A.'S. THE JUDGES CIRCULATION AND UNDERSTAND THERE IS A BROADER CONVERSATION THAN THIS BILL. THIS BILL AROSE OUT OF MY OWN. LIFE EXPERIENCE I'M A LAWMAKER THAT'S HOW I ARRIVED AT THE SUBJECT MATTER. BUT AS I SAY WAS I WAS GRATEFUL TO SIT HERE AND HEAR THE DISCUSSION OF FIFTEEN FORTY AS WELL I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND LISTENING. TO YOUR ATTENTION YOUR DUTIES. THANK YOU MR COOLEY IN A CHAIR ALSO. RECOMMENDS AN AYE VOTE AND ALSO- ABOUT. DISABILITY WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE FLORIDA COULDN'T MEMBER ID NUMBER BUT ABOUT CONSOLIDATING OR LEASE HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH MISTER KING- SO THAT- WE CAN WE CAN MAYBE MOVE S. ONE. ONE BILL- THE OTHER THING IS- AT THE LOOKING IN AND CLARIFY. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE HAVE. BROUGHT UP NOT TO GET IT BEARS THAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY CLARIFY THAT FOR THEM AND ARE STILL CHAIRS RECOMMENDED BY. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON AT TWELVE FORTY FIVE AS THE MEMBER COOLEY THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER ADDED LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING POWER CAN CORK. BURKE AYE SANTIAGO THEY ARE TO NOW THEY ARE TEN NOW WICKS. LEE. MEASURES ARTICLE. THREE MISTER RICHARDS. AB. TWELVE FIVE NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMEDIAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO START BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF TEAM FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE SO WOULD MY BELT THANK YOU APPRECIATE REALLY APPRECIATE IT I ALSO WANT TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ARE AS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS- AS THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO LIMIT THE BILL TO INCREASING THE CRIMINAL FINES FOR COMMITTING HATE CRIMES. AB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD INCREASE THE CRIMINAL FINE FOR COMMITTING A HATE CRIME AND USE THAT INCREASE TO FUND PROGRAMS ON RACIAL OR ETHNIC SENSITIVITY OR OTHER FAMILIAR WITH SIMILAR TRAINING IN THE AREA OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THANK YOU THINK MUCH THAT. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS ESPECIALLY TARGETING THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER OR AAPI COMMUNITY. HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE ORGANIZATION'S STOP API HE COALITION. NEARLY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HATE INCIDENTS OCCUR ACROSS THE-UNITED STATES. AGAINST THE API COMMUNITY WITHIN A TEN MONTH PERIOD. INCLUDING NEARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED INCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. MY DISTRICT ARE LOCATED IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HAS A POPULATION THAT IS FIFTY THREE PERCENT. API'S OF THIS ANTI ASIAN SENTIMENT IS HITTING MY DISTRICT WHERE WE ARE SEEING A P. OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. BEING THE TARGETS OF ASSAULTS- HARASSMENT AND VANDALISM.

ANGELES I LIVE IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY OF WHICH OVER FIFTY FIVE OR ALMOST 55% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE EIGHTEEN I AM A RETIRED CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATORS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS AND TODAY I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT. IT'S NO LONGER SURPRISING NEWS WHEN WE TURN ON OUR TELEVISIONS AT NIGHT HERE A LIST MANY OF REPORTS OF VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ATTACKS PERPETRATED AGAINST ASIAN AMERICAN. THESE ATTACKS ARE CONTINUING TO URGE AS CONCORD WE ATTACKERS UP TO HELP WITH ELDERS WHO CAN'T EVEN THEMSELVES. ANTI ASIAN SENTIMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT NEW EVER SINCE THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WHEN TRYING TO CAME FOR THE GOAL RUSSIAN LEADER ADDS VALUE TO THE BIRDS TO BUILD THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. THIS ONE HE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN STICKER CALL AT U. S. NEEDS FOR CHEAP CHINESE LABOR AND MUCH NEEDED CHINESE INTELLIGENCE WAXED AND WANED IN THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PLUS YEARS OF THE. CHINESE LIVING IN AMERICA. WHEN YOU CALL THE TRYING WILL. WHEN NO LONGER NEED SPEND TRYING TO MUSK BECAUSE THEN THEY ARGUE AGAINST. MERIT STRANGE ANIMAL AND PETS THEY TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM REAL AMERICANS THEY ARE SPOTLIGHTS. AND THEY CARRIED VIRUS. ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL ACTING. HISTORY AS KURDS WHEN ANTI CHINESE SENTIMENT REACHED A CLIMAX TWO YEARS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ONE OF THE WORST MASSACRE IN THE UNITED STATES HAPPENS IN DAN LOS ANGELES CHINATOWN AND THAT'S WHERE OUR CHINESE AMERICAN MUSEUM STANDS TODAY. CHINESE ADULTS AND ONE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WAS LYNCHED AND MURDERED BY A MOB OF FIVE HUNDRED WHITE VIGILANTE. THE NUMBER DIRECTLY SENATE 10% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHINATOWN RESIDENTS AT THAT HI. CHABLIS YOU WHY THE MURDERS WERE CONVICTED THEY SPEND NO TIME IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THE HALL ACT OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH STATED THAT CHINESE AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS COULD NOT TESTIFY AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE. AS AS WE GET THE CHINESE AMERICAN MUSEUM PREPARES TO REMEMBER AND PAY RESPECT TO THE SOULS OF THE MASSACRE VICTIMS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER. WE FIND OURSELVES EMOTIONALLY OVERWHELMED AND HEARTBROKEN THAT WE ARE STILL HAVING TO ADDRESS SUCH HATEFUL ACTIONS AND NEEDING TO COMBAT AND ADDRESS ANTI CHINESE EIGHT. IN FACT ANTI CHINESE AND ANTI ASIAN NEIGHBORHOODS NEVER STOPPED IN THE U. S. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO STUDY HISTORY AND LEARN ABOUT THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THE ROCK SPRINGS MASSACRE OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE SAN FRANCISCO PLAGUE OF NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT PLAYING BROKE UP TO THAT RIGHT I BREAK OUT TO WAS BLAMED ON THE CHINESE. AND VIGILANTES BRING DON CHINATOWN JUST AS THEY DID AFTER THE. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE L. A. MASSACRE. THINK IN TERMS HIS IS. OF ANTI ASIAN HATE ARE THEY ENTER OF. AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR TWO THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CHEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND THE REASON ATLANTA SHOOTING AT THE ASIAN AMERICAN SALON WORKERS. WELL THE WHOLE ABNORMAL APPLIES NOWADAYS WE SAW SIMILAR RESULTS WHEN THE KILLERS THE VINCENTIAN WERE LET OFF BY THE JUDGE BECAUSE THE FATHER AND SON WHITE COLLAR WORKERS WERE PULLED AND CALLED GOOD PEOPLE. AND THE SHOOTER IN THAT LAPTOP BASICALLY JUST HAD A BAD AGE. SO RIGHT TWENTY IT'S IMPORTANT IT PUTS ANOTHER DETERRENT INTO PLACE THAT SAYS IF YOU COMMIT A CRIME BINDO BE REPLICATION. IN THIS CASE IF YOU COMMIT A HATE CRIME AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS OR ANY GROUP. THEN THERE WILL BE A HIGHER PRICE TO PAY.

UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE REMAINING PROVISIONS INCREASING THE FINE CHOCOLATE MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY HATE CRIME STE THE HARM CAUSED WHEN DEFENDANTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY FINES IMPOSED ON THEM I. WEALTHY SEARCH AND DOCUMENT. WHEN STRUCK UNDER THE OF FROM IMPOSED OUTLOOK TO BE A- TO PAY AS FINDS THE- THEIR FAMILY THOUGHT FOR A DAY MORE DEPTH. REINTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THEY MAKE HOMELESSNESS OR EVEN RETURNED TO JAIL OR PRISON THIS IS AS TRUE COURT DEFENDANTS CHARGED WITH HATE CRIMES THAT THAT IS FOR HER TO CONSTRUCTION OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF CON. SUS WELL THE GOAL OF STOPPING HATE CRIMES IS LAUDABLE AN INCREASE AND FIND IT'S. NOT THE WAY TO REACH THIS CALL. ACTUALLY AFTER. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESS IN THE ROOM AND OPPOSITION CENA I DO WITNESSES ON THE- ON THE- TELECONFERENCE. SEEN NONE- RIENECK PRETTY NOW MAY GO TO TELEPHONE LINES UP FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT CHILD YEAH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE LINE IN HURON SD ONE MOMENT. THEY DID REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM Q. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENTS IN Q. OKAY- WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES I'M I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR USUALLY FINDS GET TRIPLED- WELL I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE VICE CHAIR WHICH YOU CAN REFER TO STAFF FOR- WHICH IS USUALLY FINDS WHEN THEY ARE MADE ARE ABOUT ACTUALLY TRIPLED IN SIZE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SURCHARGES THAT AE PUT ON THEM IS THAT GOING TO BE THE CASE WITH THESE FUNDS AS WELL. YEAH YES OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT INCREASING THIS BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YOUR INCREASING IT BY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OF THESE ADDITIONS TO GET PUT ON FOR THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. AND BASICALLY WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THE MY MINUS THE LOWER FINE ART NOW UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FURTHER I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE EVEN GONNA KNOW WHAT THE FINES ARE. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY EVEN PAY THEM SO WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH MORE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PAY THEIR FINES- I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT- I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR PUBLIC FIGURES LIKE YOURSELF AND MYSELF. TO BE OUT THERE IN COUNTERING THE- EIGHT- DIRECTLY WITH WHAT WE SAY AND DO AND NOT BEING LIKE THE FORMER PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES WHO TALKS ABOUT. CONFLUENT CHINA VIRUS. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO PRESENT THAT IN PUBLIC AND I DON'T THINK CHANGES FINES WILL DO ANYTHING. OTHER THAN END UP WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BEING PT INTO POVERTY. SO I'LL BE VOTING NO I'M SORRY. THANK TWITTER. IF I MAKE WATER- THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLICK FOR YOUR COMMENT AND- I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION AS WELL AS THE POSITION OF A CELL YOU. YET I THINK THAT- TACKLING THE ISSUE OF HATE CRIMES. IS GOING TO REQUIRE A COMBINATION OF MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND MANY SOLUTIONS. AND THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS NOW OF COURSE. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON THE FINES AND ALSO THE TRAINING ASPECT OF IT HAS REACHED AS I STATED EARLIER. ALL THE PROCEEDS WILL BE. ALLOCATED TO THE TRAINING OF A SENSITIVITY CLASSES- AND THE LIGHT WHICH IS GOING TO BE VERY HOPEFUL BECAUSE EDUCATION IS A BIG PIECE OF. THE EQUATION. NOW HAVING SAID THAT I THINK YOUR FOCUS IS ON. THE UP THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT TO FIND OUT INCLUDES WILL ACTUALLY. ADDRESS THE ISSUE YES I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BUT- YET I THINK UP THERE ARE SITUATIONS WERE IMPOSING A FINE IS GOING TO SERVE AS A DETERRENT. A PURPOSE FOR SOME DEFENDANTS AT NUMBER ONE. NOW AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE AND ALSO OF THE DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY I THINK WE HAVE SOME GUARDRAILS IN PLACE ALREADY. NUMBER ONE. JUDGES HAVE THE DISCRETION WHETHER HOW HOW MUCH ALL WEATHER HOW MUCH OR WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WOULD IMPOSE THE FINES. AND IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO THE JUDGE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. NOW THERE ARE MANY COURTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY BEFORE THE IMPOSED A FINE. AND IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IS LOOKING AT THIS VERY ISSUE. STILL THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT- THERE IS- GOING TO BE A REQUIREMENT ON ALL THE JUDGES TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT WOULD HAVE TO ABILITY TO PAY THE FINE. BEFORE THAT- DEFINE. ORDER IS IMPOSED ON THE DEFENDANT. AND FINALLY- THE BOTH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND ALSO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION HAS A PROVISION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT EXCESSIVE FINES ON DEFENDANTS PER SE SO THERE'S PLENTY OF GUARDRAILS. THAT OUGHT THAT WE'RE PLACING ON ON ON THE- THIS PARTICULAR PENALTY. OR THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF CORRECTION. AND FINALLY COURSE- THERE ALL IN BE- DEFENDANTS OF HATE CRIMES WHO COULD- PAID THE FINE. SO JUST TO RECAP IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO. OUR GRANT THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE SO THERE'S YOUR GOT ROSE ALREADY AROUND IT THAT THAT THAT THE PUNISHMENT. JUST A SAVINGS GUARDRAILS HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST. AND YET THIS IS A- SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS THAT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOCIETY TO DEAL WITH. AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEMAND THAT SOMEBODY FEEL A DIFFERENT WAY IF THAT'S HOW THEY FEEL. ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO STE SOMETIMES ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO STEER THEIR BEHAVIOR AWAY FROM ACTING OUT ON WHAT CAN BE AT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN LIKE I HATE CRIME- ACTING OUT IN A MANNER THAT- THEY FEEL INSIDE. THAT MAYBE REASON TELLS- YOU KNOW EVEN I FEEL LIKE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE. THAT THIS BILL AFFECTS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING. TO FEEL A DARN THING THEY'RE GONNA DO WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. BUT WHEN YOU SEE A SPIKE IN. HATE CRIMES GOING ON LIKE WE'RE- WE HAVE TO A- AND MONITOR FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS IT. MONITOR GIVES THEM THAT EXTRA THING TO THINK ABOUT. WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ACT OUT ON THEIR ANGER OR THEIR HATE OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S TRIGGERING THEM. AND SO I DON'T SEE THE MONETARY- ENHANCEMENT FOR THIS AS AS SOMETHING BAD I SEE TO SOMETHING GOOD AND YOU'VE ALREADY STATED THE PARTS WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE GUARDRAILS THAT ALLOW SENTENCE SAM YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE BLOOD OUT OF A TURNIP. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IF YOU'RE GONNA FIND SOMEBODY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T HAVE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS IN YOUR POCKET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IF IT CAN DETER 50% OR 60% OF THE PEOPLE THEY'RE ACTING OUT RIGHT NOW. INSTEAD OF DOING THAT DETER THEM FROM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT. HEY YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT PLENTY OF ASSETS AND SOME OF THOSE ASSETS ARE GOING TODISAPPEAR. BY ACT OUT. AT LEAST WE HAVE THAT YOU KNOW WE WISH THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. BUT WE CAN'T FIX THAT FOR THEM. WELL WE CAN FIX IS THE PART WHERE THEY'RE ACTING OUT OR AT LEAST WE CAN PROVIDE MORE DETERRENTS TO THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR BILL IS AFTER HERE. AND AND YOU KNOW FOR ME THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT IS BECAUSE WE NEED THAT DETERRENT BECAUSE WHAT ELSE IS THERE OTHER THAN TO GO IN AFTER THE FACT. AND CLEAN UP THE MESS AND WE'RE TIRED OF CLEANING UP THE MESS. THANK YOU. ELECTRIC THANK YOU KNOW JUST HOW I'LL BE VERY QUICK BECAUSE I. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DRESSING A VERY BIG PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY TODAY. AND THAT IS THERE'S TOO MUCH HATE AND I THINK THAT'S AN ARGUABLE. I THINK THAT- PEOPLE ACTING OUT ON THAT HATE IS BECOMING MORE ACCEPTABLE TO MANY AREAS. AND I THINK THAT. ANY MEASURE. THAT DISCOURAGES THEM ACTING OUT. IS TO BE SUPPORTED AND I AS LONG AS THERE'S GUARDRAILS AND THERE'S A SENSE OF REASON THAT. YOU'VE ALREADY ARTICULATED THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT THROUGH THAT AND YOU YOU PRESENTED HERE- THOUGHTFUL APPROACH WON'T WORK IN ALL INSTANCES. BUT IT WILL HELP. ADDRESS A VERY VERY TOXIC SITUATION THAT EXISTS TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SO I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHARLIE I DON'T KNOW WEEK- DIRECTOR SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO WE DISAGREED ON- BUT THE GREAT THING IS WE GET A CHANCE TO. WORK ON IT FROM. THIS POINT ON- AND- I REALLY LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A FUND. THAT WHAT WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OR TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU GET. TO START RETRAINING. I USE WERE REPROGRAMMED BECAUSE IT IT SOUNDS BAD. BUT HOW DO YOU. GET PEOPLE TO BE A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE. ABOUT THIS REALLY. REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY YOU KNOW AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FROM NOW. FOR FOREVER- PEOPLE OF YOUR STATE TO BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. AND NOW THE API COMMUNITY OF. RACE ARE RACIAL HATRED HAS NO ONE RACES NOT ALL WHITE PEOPLE HIS BLACK PEOPLE WITH ERRORS LATINOS HAVE MADE WE GOTTA WE GOTTA GET RID OF HATE. BOB KIRBY OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TO THE ROOT OF IT SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO- AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR. HOPEFULLY JOINING ME AS WE MOVE FORWARD UP UNTIL NEXT YEAR. THAT WE COME UP WITH. MMHM BUT A DECENT HATE CRIMES BILL OR A DOMESTIC TRRORIST BILL WE DO WE JUST NEED TO ALL COME TOGETHER SAID ROE. ABOVE CITED A TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT CHAIRED RECOMMEND ANNA FISHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED AB TWENTY EIGHT BY SOME MEMBER CHILD THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI GENSER IRAQI PACKY I PARA QUE HAN ERA CAN I WORK.

I MIGHT I GOT MYSELF A BIT ROCKSTARS ARCADIA RICHARD NIXON. OKAY YOU MAY BE AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVEN HUNDRED. UNDER CURRENT LAW DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY. FACING FELONY CASES ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE PERSONALLY PRESENT DURING TRIAL OR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION. HOWEVER IN CERTAIN INSTANCES A TRIAL CAN PROCEED IN THE DEFENDANT'S ABSENCE. WHAT AFTER THE TRIAL OR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION HAS COMMENCED IN THEIR PRESENCE AND QUOTE THANK YOU- THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN THANK YOU WHEN DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY ARE NOT PRESENT FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TRIAL OR THE PRE- THIS HAS BECOME A MAJOR ISSUE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC- IT PUTS JUDGES IN A PARTICULARLY BAD SPOT. WHEN THERE'S NO TIME WAIVER FOR THE FREE ONE MORE FOR THE TRIAL BECAUSE THEY EITHER HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME WAIVER STATUTES- AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME WEBER STATUTES THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ORDER THE DEFENDANTS TO BE- PRESENT WHICH REQUIRES THE SHERIFF'S OF COURSE TO. POTENTIALLY TRANSPORT THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL WHICH KIND OF PUTS EVERYBODY IN A BAD. BAD SPOT SO WHAT AB SEVEN HUNDRED WOULD DO IS IT WOULD ALLOW PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OR TRIAL TO PROCEED EVEN IF THE TRIAL. OR PRE ONE HAS NOT COMMENCED IN THE DEFENDANT'S PRESENCE UNDER CERTAIN NARROW CONDITIONS ONE THE DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY TO THE COURT MAKES CERTAIN FINDINGS. INCLUDING THAT THE DEFENDANT THERE'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT IS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSING TO NOT APPEAR IN COURT. THREE THE DEFENDANT MUST BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO'S PRESIDENT AND FOR THE DEFENDANTS HAVE TO BE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS- I WOULD NOTE THAT. THANK THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON IT WE DID TAKE THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THESE A SHOW YOU IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION. WHICH A- STIPULATED OF WILL PUT INTO STATUTE THAT.

TO BE PRESENT IN COURT DURING CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. OF COURSE HOW LONG HELD THAT DEFENDANTS ME VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PREENT IN COURT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT COURT AT THE TIME TO COMMENCEMENT OF TRIAL IN THE NATION. HOWEVER UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THE CALIFORNIA STATUTES GOVERNING INDEPENDENT CREDIT AND- FOUR DEFENDANTS HELP VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHT TO BE PRESENT IN COURT FOR TRIAL AND P. AX. IT MUST BE PRESENT IN COURT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TRIAL. WELL YOU KNOW VETERANS WORSE EVERY YEAR THERE ARE NUMBER DEFENDANTS WHO DO NOT WISH TO BE BROUGHT INTO COURT EVEN BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF TRIAL WITH YET. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE. QUARTER CAUGHT A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. IF THEY WANT TO PROCEED BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOU WITNESSES WHO WERE NOT MADE AVAILABLE- BECAUSE FURTHER DELAY DOESN'T THAT IF ANYONE. THE COURT EVEN HAVE TO FOR THE DEFENDANT FORCIBLY BROUGHT INTO COURT WHICH IS DANGEROUS THE PEOPLE BRING DEFENDANT THE COURT AS WELL AS A DEFENDANT HIMSELF. THEY MADE ME FEEL WAS. FOR THEM TO BUY LIKE TO STAND. AND A SIMILAR PROBLEM WHEN PERSON IS WITH THE- IF YOU CUT. AND DOESN'T WISH TO LOOK IN COURT FIRST SPECIFIED. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES A- FIX. THAT'S ALL THESE ONGOING PROBLEMS. WITHOUT TAMPERING EXIST LAW GOVERNING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. WE NEED FAMILY. PHYSICAL PRESENT IN COURT. AND WISHES TO ENTER SUCH CONTRACTS. THIS BILL WHICH THANKS TO MODIFICATIONS REQUESTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WILL HAVE GREATER PROTECTION THAN PROVIDED BY ANY STATE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ON AB SIX TWENTY FOUR A TECHNICAL BE HUGELY IMPACTFUL. PROCEDURAL BUILDING WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH IN OUR STATE. SECOND OUR SYSTEM THE FOCUS IS JUSTLY ON REHABILITATION IS CENTERED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR THE YOUTH AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN SOME CASES THE PROSECUTION MAY ARGUE THE HEARING THERE YOU'D BE TRANSPORTED TO ADULT COURT FOREGOING THE JUVENILE COURT PROCESS. CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DAHLE CORE FACING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. STATISTICS SHOW THE BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY SENT TO ADULT COURT WHETHER WHITE COUNTERPARTS ARE MRE OFTEN ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN JUVENILE JURISDICTION. BY STAYING IN JUVENILE COURT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A PROCESS THAT IS REHABILITATIVE AND EDUCATION FOCUSED. SHOPPING LATE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO RIGHT TO APPEAL THE DECISION WHAT DO YOU THIS FORCED INTO ADULT COURT ONLY DISCRETIONARY RIPPED IT IS OFTEN SUMMARILY. DENIED AND NOT REVIEWED ON ITS MERITS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES NOT HAPPEN THIS PROCESS BUT AT THE CLEAR PATH REVIEW OF THESE TRANSFER DECISIONS. AB SIX TWENTY FOUR CREATES AN APPEAL PROCESS FOR THE DECISION TO TRANSFER YOU TO ADULT COURT. IT ALSO REQUIRES TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER AS NOT TO DELAY THE USE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. THE BILL IS IN LINE WITH OUR VALUES TO DO WHAT IS TRULY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THESE YOUTH AT A PIVOTAL JUNCTURE IN THEIR LIFE. AND WHAT CAN CHARITABLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIFE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THIS IS A MEANINGFUL WRITE. A REVIEW FOR THE JUVENILES INVOLVED. WITH EACH H. TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT IS JONATHAN LABEL WITH THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER AND MERITS SO WHO WILL GIVE A FIRST HAND ACCOUNT FOR THE NEED OF HIS FELLOW. THANK YOU YOU MADE TESTS FIVE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JONATHAN WAHBA AND I'M A MANAGING ATTORNEY WITH THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER WITH THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER THE SPONSORED AB SIX TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE YOUTH CARE PROCESS OCT. PJD SEES A STATEWIDE PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR YOUTH IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT JUVENILE POLICY ISSUES. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. ONLY A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE CAN ORDER AFTER HEARING THAT HE USED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS CALLED THE DECISION A TRANSFEREE YOUTHS FROM JUVENILE TO ADULT COURT. THE WORST PUNISHMENT THAT THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IS EMPOWERED TO INFLECT. ARE YOU TO IS TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PUNISHMENT AS THE YOU TO COMMITTED THE SAME CRIME. UP TO LIFE IN PRISON. USER WAS TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT WILL BE INCARCERATED IN THE SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON PUNISHMENT NOT REHABILITATION. TRANSFERRED OVER DAHLE COURT- IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DESCRIBED IS ALSO AN AREA FOR YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT SEES SIGNIFICANT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. TRANSFER USER OVERWHELMINGLY YOUTH OF COLOR. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND 1883% OF YOU SUBJECT TO TRANSFER HEARINGS WERE BLACK AND LATIN EXCUSE. WHEN TRANSFER HEARINGS ARE HELD. YOUTH OF COLOR ARE MORE OFTEN FOUND UNSUITABLE FOR JUVENILE COURT. THERE IS ALSO A CONCERN THAT THE CLOSURE OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS AND EXACERBATE THESE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. DESPITE THE ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSFER DECISION CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY PROVIDES NO RIGHT TO HAVE AN APPELLATE COURT REVIEW THAT DECISION. THIS BILL IS A MODEST TO COMMONSENSE REFORM INTENDED TO CURE THAT LONGSTANDING INJUSTICE SB SIX TWENTY FOUR CREATE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE TRANSFER DECISION TO ENSURE THAT THE DECISION WILL BE REVIEWED BY A HIGHER COURT. THIS SYSTEM OF INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL IS ESSENTIAL TO DETECTING CORRECT- RONI'S JUVENILE COURT RULINGS AND WILL BRING CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICES IN LINE WITH THE MANY OTHER STATES THAT OFFER A RIGHT TO APPEAL. THE PROCESS TODAY BETWEEN SIX TWENTY FOUR CREATES WILL ENSURE THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE CORRECTLY AND IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE LAW. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

JACKIE ARE LACKING I BARRICADE HAN HI PARA QUE HAN HI CORK. CORK I SAN DIEGO. CA ARE TEMP HI THERE TELL AYE WICKS. LI LI I. MEASURE PASSED REGULATIONS THANK YOU. NEXT BILL WOULD BE- AB NINE THIRTY NINE YEP. THANK YOU AT THE THRESHER AND MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED FAMILY BILL NINE THIRTY NINE THE DENIM DAY ACT FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SABRINA CERVANTES UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S OUT SIX I WILL BE STEPPING IN FOR HER TODAY. WILL BUT SHE WANTS TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WHO ARE CO AUTHORING A FAMILY MEMBERS BOERNER HORVATH BURKE CORREO GARCIA ELORANTA GONZALEZ IRWIN PETRIE-NORRIS AND QUICK SILVA. SO YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR WE CELEBRATED FERGUSON CELEBRATE WE- HONOR DENIM DAY WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT A SURVIVOR'S MANNER OF DRESS SHOULD NOT TO BE EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE SIGNED ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF THAT RESOLUTION. AND YET IN OUR LAW AS IT STANDS TODAY WHAT THE VICTIM WAS WEARING CAN BE ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE IF IT IS QUOTE UNQUOTE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. AND I WAS THERE BECAUSE I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THEY WOULD EVER BE AN INSTANCE WHERE WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TO ADMIT SUCH EVIDENCE. WE HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO YOU COULD NOT ADMIT. WHETHER THE VICTIM AND THE- PERPETRATOR WERE DATING- IN AMERICA RELATIONSHIP. YOU CANNOT ADMIT WHETHER THE PERPETRATOR IS USING. CONTROL DEVICE YOU CANNOT ADMITS THE SURVIVOR SEXUAL HISTORY AS EVIDENCE. I'VE CONSENT AND YET IF THE VICTIM IF SOMEBODY WANTS THE VICTIM'S CLOTHING TO BE ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT A HEARING IS HELD OUTSIDE OF. THE JURY TO DISCUSS WHETHER THAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND I WANT TO PAUSE RIGHT THERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THAT MEANS YES THE JURY LEAVES THE ROOM BUT THE VICTIM. MUST SIT THERE AND GO THROUGH WHAT HERE SHE WAS WEARING IN ORDER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE OF CONSENTS. FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND SURVIVORS IN THE U. S. ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT. OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONLY EIGHTY CASES ARE TRIED IN OF THOSE EIGHTY ONLY FIVE PERPETRATORS WILL EVER SERVE TIME. FIVE OUT OF ONE THOUSAND PERPETRATORS SERVE TIME FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT ARE ALLEGED. AND YOU KNOW MATH TELLS US THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS THE VICTIM VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND YOU KNOW WHY HOW DID YOUR FRIEND IN COLLEGE WHO WAS THE VICTIM OF DATE RAPE. AND SHE WENT TO THE AUTHORITIES INSTEAD OF GOING TO PRESS CHARGES SHE WAS SAID SHE WAS TOLD WELL THEY'RE GONNA DRAG YOU THROUGH THE MUD IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR WORD AGAINST HIS. AND SO ALL OF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT SHE DID SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES. AS MOST VICTIMS DON'T. AND THEN I HAVE A DEAR FRIEND WHO WAS RAPED ON HER WAY TO WORK. DRAGGED INTO AN ALLEY IN THE EARLY MORNINGS AND RAPED BY A STRANGER. AND NOT A FRIEND OF MINE GOT JUSTICE. THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A STRANGER THEY WERE BROUGHT THEY FOUND THE PERSON AND THEY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND SHE GOT JUSTICE EVERY VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DESERVES JUSTICE AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THIS. IS A TO SOME VICTIMS YOU BETTER THINK TWICE BECAUSE WHAT YOU WERE WEARING MIGHT BE CONSIDERED EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE WE SITTING HERE TODAY NO THAT WHAT THE VIC WAS WEARING DOES NOT GRANT CONSENT EVER. IT IS ONLY THE PERSON WHO MAY GRANT OR WITHDRAW CONSENT AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND SO WITH THAT. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THE WITNESS WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. PARDEE ALEXANDER U. S. AND VETERAN U. S. NAVY VETERAN AND A CAMPUS SURVIVOR ADVOCATE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN SAN BERNARDINO. SHE BRINGS OVER EIGHT YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD AND SHE WILL TESTIFY AS PART. JONES SAWYER AND BY. A LACKEY IN MEMBER. MY NAME IS COURTNEY HOW. COMMON IN EIGHT AND I'M A CO. TO SURVIVOR AT THE AT CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSITY IS. NINETY OVER MY EIGHT YEAR TO MAKE. WORKING IN AVERAGE. I HAVE SEEN A COMMON THEME INVEST. WAS ATTEMPTED THAT PROVIDE. AFTER HANNAH HUNDRED SURVIVOR INTO THAT SUCH AS FOR THE PART OF DEFENSE BECAUSE CAMPUSES SUPPORT HEALTHCARE I HAVE BECOME WITH THIS. USED TO CREDIT FOR IF YOU TO ACT OF. SOME OF THE MOST STRATEGIES I HAVE SEEN ARTS ABOUT THE SURVIVOR SEXUAL HISTORY. QUESTION HOW COULD CONSENT WAS IMPLYING THE ON THE FIFTH BECAUSE. THEY ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AND ARE MET WITH SKEPTICISM AND EVEN SOMETIMES DISBELIEF. AFTER REPORTING EVEN LESSER VIRUS CONTINUE WITH THE CASE ENTIRETY YOU KNOW HOW GRUELING THE PROCESS AND- AS AN ADVOCATE I AM PRESENT WITH THE VIRUS YOU EACH STEP OF THE K. RIGHT IN THE SUPPORT THEY WANTED SOME OF THE LOWEST MOMENTS OF THEIR LIVES. INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDE SURVIVOR HAVING THEM NOW CHEN TOLD WHAT TAKING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EXAM FOR EVIDENCE AND EVEN BEING PHOTOGRAPHED NAKED. RIGHT CAN OFTEN TAKE HOURS YOU CAN BE VERY HUMILIATING AND TRAUMATIZING. AFTER DEALING WITH THREE KIDS THURMOND EXPECTED TO GREEN LED THE ASSAULT OVER AND OVER IT MADE TO THE FANS THEMSELVES THEIR ACTORS ARE PICKED APART. LESS THAN 5% OF RATE CASES THAT A REPORTER FALL. WHICH MEANS 95% OF RATES ARE TRUE. WHAT'S THE MATTER IS THAT ONLY 34% OF THE CELLS ARE EVER RECORDED. THE MOBILE I RESPECTFULLY AND VIOLENCE. THE ONLY WAY TO COME BACK WITH OUR REPENTANCE REPORTING IT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AROUND HOW WE TALK ABOUT AND DEAL WITH ALL. OF OUR NOT UNFAIR TO BE INVESTIGATED AND THEIR COURAGE TO BE A PART OF IT. THE PROBLEM WITH CONSIDERING FIRING CLOTHING AS EVIDENCE THAT THE PERCEPTION OF HOW APPROPRIATELY OR INAPPROPRIATELY FEMINISTA BERRIES BASED ON WHO THAT PERSON IS. ONE PERSON MAY BE TIGHT ROUTINES APPROPRIATE AND CUTE. ANOTHER PERSON MAY SEE THOSE SCENES AS AN APPROPRIATE AND ASKING FOR IT. THE TYPICALLY THIRD NO TREND AND WHAT WOMEN ARE WEARING THAT'S ALL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE USE OF THE VICTIMS OUTFIT AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT. BOTH FORMAL LIKELY TO BE ASSAULTED ARE ACTUALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THOSE OF LOWER SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASS. HOMELESS ADULT WOMEN AND HOMELESS LGBTQ ARE A PLUS YOU. WHEN ASKED WHAT THEY WERE WEARING LAUTECH TATTERED CLOTHING OVERSIZED- LAYERED CLOTHING AND DID NOT PAID REGULARLY. WHY CONGRESS FOR VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION OF THE HOMELESS WOMEN IS 97% MAKING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND NORMATIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THIS POPULATION. THE WAY SOMEONE IS DRESSED DO NOT MAKE THEM. MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO BE ASSAULTED SO CONSIDERING CLOTHING IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SHOWING SKEPTICISM. PROVIDERS RATHER THAN BELIEVING. WE'VE GOT OF THE WHAT THE WHEN IS WEARING CONSENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF CONVENTIONAL CUT. BY QUESTIONING WHAT SURVIVORS WEARING WE'RE APPLYING THAT WITH SOMEONE WEARING. IT AND IT DID NOT. SOMEONE CAN BE NAKED AND SAY NO TO SEX. SOMEONE CAN BEGIN HAVING SEX IN THE- THEY NO LONGER WANT TO CONTINUE. AND ONE COMPLAINT IS TAKING AWAY THE SEX IS NO LONGER CONSENSUAL EVER SURVIVOR DOES NOT GIVE CONSENT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY'RE WEARING WHEN THEY WERE ASSAULTED. EIGHTY NINE THREE NINE IS TIMELY AND NECESSARY I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK REGARDING AB. NINE THREE NINE. OKAY THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. YES SIR.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN SUPPORT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN THE CHAMBER HERE. K. OPPOSITION I THINK WE HAVE MARGO GEORGE ON THE LINE. OPERATOR. RIGHT IS RIGHT. THANK YOU- MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION FIRST LET ME SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION RECOGNIZES THAT HIS LEGISLATION IS AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH THE SEX INCIDENT OUTDATED STEREOTYPES ABOUT WOMEN'S CLOTHING SOMEHOW INDICATING THAT THEY HAVE CONSENTED TO BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. HOWEVER WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB NINE THREE NINE BECAUSE IT ADVOCATES THE TRUTH AND EVIDENCE RULE IS NOT NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE GUARD RAILS ALREADY IN PLACE AND WOULD POTENTIALLY DENIED THE DEFENDANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE AND CONFRONT THE WITNESSES AGAINST THEM IN SERIOUS CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS POTENTIALLY. FACING LIFE IN PRISON. AS INDICATED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION EIGHT ALSO KNOWN AS THE VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS. THE INITIATIVE ENACTED THE RIGHT TO TRUTH AND EVIDENCE IN ADOPTED CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY TO EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THE PROVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSION OF RELEVANT EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO ADMIT EVIDENCE IF IT IS RELEVANT AND AN OUT LIAR CASE. IT REQUIRES A SPECIAL HEARING. SOUTH SIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY TO DETERMINE THE RELEVANCE OF THE EVIDENCE AND EVEN UPON A FINDING THAT THE EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT THE JUDGE MUST STILL DETERMINE. WHETHER TO ADMIT THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE EXISTING LAWS CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION WHICH REQUIRES THE ADMISSION OF RELEVANT EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE. THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THEIR INTRODUCTION OF GOVERNANCE IN ALL CASES REGARDLESS OF THE RELEVANT OR WHETHER THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE FAVORITE AT SUBMISSION. I WANT TO SHARE AN EXAMPLE FROM A LAWYER IN THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE HE TRY SIX CASES. HE POINTS OUT THAT AN HONEST AND REASONABLE MISTAKE ABOUT CONSENT IS A VALID DEFENSE TO RAPE CASES IT'S KNOWN AS THE MAIN DAIRY DEFENSE. IF THE YOUNG MAN HONESTLY AND REASONABLY BELIEVES THAT SEX WAS CONSENSUAL CONSENSUAL HE SHOULD NOT GO TO PRISON FOR LIFE. DISTRIBUTION BILL APPLY TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OF MANNER OF DRESS EVEN IN THE MAYBERRY SITUATION. YES IT DOES APPLY TO THE MAYBERRY SAID DEFENSELESS OFFER A HYPOTHETICAL. I UNDERSTAND HOW DELICATE THIS ISSUE AS AND THAT CONSENT IS SACRED FOR ALL WOMEN INCLUDING SEX WORKERS OF COURSE. BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SEX WORKER TRIES TO GET ATTENTION ON A STREET CORNER AND ADVERTISES. HERSELF WITH HER CLOTHING FOR EXAMPLE WEARING A TRENCH CLOTHES COAT FLIPPING IT OPEN AND HAVING NOTHING UNDERNEATH EXCEPT HER UNDERWEAR SHOULD THAT NOT BE RELEVANT IF SHE LATER LICENSE CLAIM SHE WAS KIDNAPPED BY A POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER SHOULD THE ACCUSED BE PREVENTED FROM OFFERING FACTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY RELEVANT THIS BILL SAYS THAT BATTLE AGAINST DOES NOT MATTER. AND THAT FRANKLY IS HORRIFYING WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON EIGHTY NINE THREE NINE THANK YOU. OKAY OUR NEXT WITNESS WOULD BE KATHY SURE FROM THE ACLU. YES GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON KATHY SURE FOR RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE- WE OF COURSE WANT TO SEE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CHIEF JUSTICE BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT DEFENDANTS CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT ALSO CONSIDER JACKSON- I THINK MAJORITY DONE- HAS SAID EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD HAVE SENT- AS TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH- THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE MAY BE RELEVANT AND MAY BE AN INTERESTS OF JUSTICE- THOSE INSTANCES ARE AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHERE. IT IS DIFFICULT UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR AN ATTORNEY TO BE ABLE TO SHOW AT THAT HOW THE VICTIM WAS DRAFTED IS RELEVANT AND IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. AND IT'S RARE FOR EITHER SIDE TO SEEK ADMISSION FOR THIS TYPE OF EVIDENCE AND RARE FOR IT TO BE ADMITTED WHAT JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOULD BE ADMITTED HOWEVER OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE SHOULD ALLOW THE JUDGE TO MAKE THAT CALL AND UNDER EXISTING LAW. WE RESPECTFULLY. ASK YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU. OPERATOR WE HAVE ANY OTHER. PEOPLE WHO THIS PART BILL THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THAT OPPOSITION. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK YOUR OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHT NINE THREE NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. BLIGHTED FIVE THIRTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOU MISTER MEMBERS FLYING CHANNEL RIVERSIDE SHARE CERTIFICATION ONE CARRYING A POLICE OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION REGRETFULLY WE WERE UNABLE TO OUR VOICE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL EARLIER ENOUGH. FOR DOING SO NOW THANK YOU. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN CHAMBER THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE- COMMITTEE YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS. THIS IS YOUR TELL. SURE EXPRESSED SOME COMMENTS ON IT- ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT. WE STOP USING THE EXCUSE OF HOW HOW A PERSON IS DRESSED AS SOMEHOW AN INVITATION A. X. L. E. MATT CONSENT TO BE ATTACKED AND RATE- IS THE VERY PROTECTIVE FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS- I WOULD SURE LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR SO MAYBE WE CAN ASK FOR LATER HE'S ACCEPTING CO AUTHORS. BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT HOW HORRIFYING IT IS- YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IT'S NOT HARD IT'S WHAT IF YOU DON'T IF THIS PERSON SAYS NOW IT'S TIME TO STOP. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. AND AND I UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE TACTICS AND I KNOW THE DEFENDERS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE THAT'S THEIR JOB. BUT SOME OF THOSE TACTICS INCLUDE TRYING TO PUT. IF THE PERSON THAT'S THE VICTIM IN SUCH A POSITION THAT THEY JUST CAN'T STAND DOING CAN'T STAND WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE TO THEM IN ORDER FOR THEM TO PROVE. THAT SOMEHOW THIS WAS NOT CONSENSUAL. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT THAT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THIS GETS USED AND THAT'S FOR THE JURIES TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND THAT'S FOR THE AND THAT'S WHERE DEFENDERS HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB. BUT THIS PARTICULAR PART. IRRITATES ME TO NO END- BECAUSE EVEN IN THE CASE OF THE PROSTITUTE I UNDERSTAND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT KIDNAPPING. BUT IF THE PROSTITUTE SIDE TO SAY NOW. IN THE GAME IS OVER. AND AND YOU MOVE ON. SO SO ANYWAY- I PLAN ON SUPPORTING THIS AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING AND THANK YOU WITH A RECORD K. HUNT FOR A- FOR- STANDING IN PLACE OF THAT SO WE COULD HEAR THE BILL TODAY THANKS. FOR THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A NO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT- BEFORE I LET YOU TO CLOSE IT I BELIEVE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS IMPORTANT. AND VICTIMS- DESERVE ADVOCACY SO I TAKE YOU FOR HAVING THE STRENGTH TO BRING FORWARD AND- WITH THAT ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND I JUST DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION A FEW THINGS THE OPPOSITION SAID IF YOU MIND. SO OBVIOUSLY. THE CONSTITUTION GIVES A DEFENDANT THE RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE THEIR ACCUSER IN THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THAT AND I WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR. IN THE HYPOTHETICAL WAS GIVEN AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE MISTER SAY OUR TELL. IF THAT WOMAN DID FLASH AND WAS ONLY WEARING UNDERWEAR AND THEN. MOMENTS LATER SAID NO. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH YOU IT'S OVER. AND SO WHAT SHE WAS WEARING NO LONGER BECOMES EVIDENCE OF CONSENT. NOW YOU CAN USE THAT ANALYZE CLEAR. AS EVIDENCE TO. TALK ABOUT THE VERACITY WHICH HE SANG THE TRUTHFULNESS OF HER TESTIMONY THIS DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM DOING THAT AND I WANT THAT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR IT JUST STOPS YOU FROM USING WHAT THE VICTIM'S WEARING. FOR PURPOSES OF CONSENT AND THE PROPOSITION ALLOWS US TO EXCLUDE. EVIDENCE THAT IS NOT RELEVANT THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE QUESTION OF CONSENT BECAUSE CLOTHING DOES NOT GIVE ANYONE THE RIGHT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ANYBODY. AND SO I THINK IT IS HIGH TIME THAT WE DON'T PUT VICTIMS THROUGH THIS HEARING THAT THE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS. BECAUSE IS THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID IN HIS MAY BE THE CASE IT MAY HAPPEN AT THE END OF THAT HEARING MOST COURTS DON'T ADMIT THIS EVIDENCE. BUT THAT HEARING IS ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY. WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT VICTIMS THROUGH THAT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IBM. OKAY I- COULD COULD THE MEMBERS PLEASE RESTATE THE MOTION AND SECOND. I JUST I MOVED A SECOND. AND OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY THE CHAIR RECOMMENDED. WELL YOU DON'T START- YEAH IF YOU PLEASE CALL FOR THE QUESTION.

MY MAKE UP OF ONE ISSUES AB THIRTEEN ONLY FUTURE ISSUES HERE. ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN. AB ONE TWO EIGHT ONE TWELVE EIGHTY ONE BLANCA RUBIO. RIMAU PROCEDURE PROTECTIVE ORDERS MISS RODEO YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A FAMILY BILL TWELVE EIGHTY ONE IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE COMING FOR OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE SEEKS TO AMEND THE PENAL CODE SECTIONS RELATING TO EXPUNGEMENT TO SPECIFIC TO SPECIFY THAT THE DISMISSAL OF THE CASE UNDER THOSE SECTIONS WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY WE BELIEVE A DEFENDANT FROM THE TERMS F EIGHT UNEXPIRED TENURE CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDER ISSUED IN THE CASE. THESE TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE ONLY ISSUED IN CERTAIN SERIOUS CASES SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING AND ELDER ABUSE. THE ORDERS PLACE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROTECTING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES. CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE NOT PUNITIVE IN NATURE THEY ARE NON PENAL RESTRICTIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT CRIMP CRIME VICTIMS. THE BILL IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY DOES NOT REQUIRED THAT THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS REMAIN IN PLACE IN ALL CASES IT MERELY PRESERVES G. JUDICIAL DISCRETION. TO TERMINATE OR MODIFY AN ORDER DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE. THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND ENJOYS APART FROM CRIME VICTIMS ADVOCATE ADVOCACY GROUPS. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU READY. ENTER YOUR WITNESSES. YES I SHOULD HAVE ON LESLIE YES CLIMB LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON THE PHONE. YES HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M LESLIE KLEIN I AM I AM AN ASSISTANT HEAD DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MOST RECENTLY WITH THE FAMILY VIOLENCE DIVISION. WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSORS AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE. ATTACKED OF ORDERS ARE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOLS USED IN THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CRIME PARTICULARLY IN CASES INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING. DUE TO THE INTRINSIC ONGOING NATURE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE INCIDENTS AMOUNT TO A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY ANY ACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN QUICKLY ESCALATE INTO A VIOLENT FELONY INCLUDING ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE. I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN MY TWENTY SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. PROTECTIVE ORDERS GIVE VICTIMS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR ABUSERS AWAY. A PROTECTIVE ORDER CAN LITERALLY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE BILL WE ARE PROPOSING DOES NOT ADD ANY MORE RESTRICTIONS IT SIMPLY CLARIFIES A VAGUENESS IN THE LAW AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. COURTS ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND DISCRETION TO ISSUE CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS UPON CONVICTION AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING. ELDER ABUSE AND SPECIFIED SEX CRIMES THAT ARE VALID FOR UP TO TEN YEARS IN BOTH FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR CASES. ALTHOUGH TO CAN YOUR PROTECTIVE ORDER IS MOST OFTEN OBTAINED AND FELONY CASES THERE ARE SOME MISDEMEANOR CASES WHERE A TEN YEAR PROTECTIVE ORDER WAS ISSUED. BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE CASES INVOLVING MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF ABUSE PRIOR HISTORY OF ABUSE FOR INJURIES THAT ARE QUITE SERIOUS BUT JUST DON'T QUITE RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A FELONY CHARGE. IMPORTANTLY COURT HAD THE JURISDICTION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THOSE PROTECTIVE ORDERS WITHIN TEN YEARS AFTER ISSUANCE AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THAT. CURRENTLY WHEN A DEFENDANT MOVED TO HAVE THEIR CASE DISMISSED UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE OR THREE POINT FOUR TWELVE OH THREE POINT FOUR EIGHT. ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR B. OR IF DISMISSED UNDER TWELVE OR THREE POINT FOUR TWO FIVE NOTHING IN THESE SECTIONS ADDRESSED HOW THE COURT SHOULD HANDLE THE ISSUE OF THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT WHEN THE DISMISSAL IS GRANTED UNDER ANY OF THE SECTIONS OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER PRESUMPTIVELY REMAINS VALID UNTIL ITS EXPIRATION DATE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GIVEN THE COURTS TO THE DISCRETION. TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THE ORDER IF PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION THAT WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH ACTION. CURRENTLY WHEN THIS ISSUE ARISES IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL JUDGE AND HOW HE OR SHE DECIDES TO HANDLE THE ISSUE. IF IT EVEN ADDRESS AT ALL. MANY JUDGES WILL APPROVED A PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAINING IN EFFECT MANY TIMES THE ISSUE WAS NOT DISCUSSED AT ALL BUT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAINS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS LEAVING AND DEFEND IT WITHOUT ANY INSIGHT THAT HE OR SHE MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROTECTIVE ORDER. IN OTHER INSTANCES COURTS MAY FEEL THAT THEY MUST DISMISS TO PROTECT EXISTING PROTECTIVE ORDER IF THEY DISMISS THE CASE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE GIVE THE COURT GUIDANCE ON IT'S A STORY AND PUT THE DEFENDANT ON NOTICE THAT HE OR SHE IS STILL SUBJECT TO THE ORDER. UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COURT TERMINATE OR MODIFY THE ORDER. IT FURTHER GIVE THE VICTIM THE PEACE OF MIND TO KNOW THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS IN PLACE. ANY SUGGESTION THAT THE VICTIM COULD SIMPLY GET A CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDER IF THEY REALLY WANTED ONE IS FLAWED. NAVIGATING THE COURT SYSTEM IS A DAUNTING PROCESS TO MOSTLY PEOPLE. AND IT FORCES THE VICTIM TO HAVE TO RE LIVE THE ATROCITIES THEY'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED WHILE HOPING AND PRAYING THE JUDGE WILL GRANT IT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS EXPRESSED TO ME BY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR THERE IS A FEAR THAT GOING BACK TO COURT YEARS LATER WELL AS SHE PUT IT. POKE THE HORNET'S NEST AND REFOCUSED THE ABUSER ON THE VICTIM. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE HELPS ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND TEN YEAR PROTECTIVE ORDER LAWS ISN'T PUT IN JEOPARDY BY ADDRESSING THE BIGNESS CURRENTLY FOUND IN TWELVE THREE POINTS FOR. 12-1 THREE POINT FOR A COUPLE OF THREE POINT FOUR B. AND TWELVE OR THREE POINT FOUR TWO FIVE. THESE PENAL CODE SECTIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS EXPUNGEMENT FACTIONS HAVE NEVER ELIMINATED ALL RESTRICTIONS. EXIST FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE SUCH AS ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE CASE WAS DISMISSED THE RIGHT TO SAY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME WHEN SUBMITTING A JOB APPLICATION. BUT THOSE CODE SECTIONS AND CASE LAW HAVE ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THAT THAT NOT EVERY CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONVICTION SHOULD DISAPPEAR. THE INDIVIDUAL IS STILL BARRED FROM OWNING OR POSSESSING A FIREARM THEY MUST STILL REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER IF THE CONDITION REQUIRED IT. AND THEY MUST DISCLOSE THE CONDITION IN CERTAIN SPECIFIED SITUATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT NOT EVERY RESTRICTION IS A LIMITATION OR PENALTY LIKEWISE PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE NOT INTENDED AS PUNISHMENT FOR THE DEFENDANT BUT AS PROTECTION FOR THE VICTIMS. WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES INSIDE THE CHAMBER FORTY TWO OH TWO.

CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED THE BENEFITS OF ALLOWING CERTAIN OFFENDERS TO PUT THEIR RECORDS BEHIND THEM AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES BY ALLOWING THOSE OFFENDERS TO HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WHAT INSTEAD IN THE LIMITED CATEGORIES OF CASES WHERE EXPUNGEMENT IS AVAILABLE KEEP THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ARE SUBJECT TO PROTECT THE BORDERS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CRIMINAL COURT FOR A PERIOD OF. TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE ORDER TO REMAIN IN EFFECT. THE KINDS OF CASES IN WHICH SUCH AN ORDER CAN BE ISSUED INCLUDE NOT ONLY FELONIES OR CRIMES OF VIOLENCE. BUT ALSO MANY MISDEMEANORS FOR EXAMPLE ALL REGISTRABLE FACT AND- MOREOVER A PROTECTIVE ORDER CAN BE ISSUED NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE VICIM BUT ALSO IN SOME CASES TO PROTECT THE WITNESS TO A CRIME. COMPLIANCE WITH AN ORDER THAT REQUIRES STAYING AWAY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEIGHBORS FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THAT PERSON'S ABILITY TO REINTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND BEGAN THIS. ORDER CAN WOULD MEAN. THAT FOR UP TO TEN YEARS DURING WHICH TIME HER NAME UNDER. THE JURISDICTION OF THE CRIMINAL COURT.

NINE FIVE EIGHT YES. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME SAY THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO MRS TO DETERMINES TO OTHER MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINE FIVE EIGHT. WITH SIX THE BAND POLICE GAINES. ALSO KNOWN AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALSO KNOWN AS CLICKS EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE KITCHEN TO THE CHAIR TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING STRIPPING AND MAKING THIS BILL BETTER. AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS MY AMENDMENTS THIS BILL ALSO MAKES AN OFFICER PARTICIPATING IN A POLICE CLICK SUBJECT TO TERMINATION. I WOULD JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE MOTION. WHEN YOU SPEAK UP PLEASE REFORM- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT IT FROM A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LANDS. AT THE VERY BASIC LEVEL EVERY SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT APARTMENT SHOULD PROHIBIT THE PARTICIPATION OF. OF ANY AND ALL KINDS OF POLICE OFFICER CLICKS IN IT OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE. HOW CAN WE EXPECT OFFICERS TO UPHOLD THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRUST. IF HE OR SHE AND THE COMMUNITY. IS PART OF OR PURSE BEING PERSUADED TO JOIN AND BE PART OF A DEPARTMENTAL CLICK. AS A POLICE OFFICER IF THEY REFUSED TO JOIN IF YOU HAVE OFFICER WHO'S REFUSING TO JOIN MOST OF THEM ARE OSTRACIZED LACKS SUPPORT FACE RETALIATION ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THE LAW LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF IN LOS ANGELES OFFICERS FORMING SECRETIVE CLICKS. AT STATIONS IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THE REPORT. ALLEGE UNDERSCORE LEADS UNDER LEADS NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF ACTIVITIES AMONG EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT CLIQUES. AND THAT THE IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SOME OF THEM HAVE MATCHING TATTOOS HAND SIGNALS A RITUAL THAT ARE SIMILAR TO A CRIMINAL STREET GANG LAST YEAR A DEPUTY SHERIFF WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAY HE WAS PUT. HE WAS PUT UP- HE HAD TO PUT UP FIVE YEARS OF BEING BULLIED INTIMIDATED BY MEMBERS OF A GANG OF DEPUTIES- IF THE COMPTON SHERIFF'S STATION KNOWN AS THE EXECUTIONERS. THIS IS A RECORD BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF. I'M SURE ALEX BEING AVAILABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE FIRST POLICY IN HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT THE BANDIT GANGS AND SECRETIVE SOCIETIES. ALLOWING A CULTURE OF POLICE CLICKS TO CONTINUE IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO BUILDINGAND PRESERVING TRUST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE IS ALSO A DANGER IN. OUR REPUTATION DAMAGING THE REPUTATION OF GOOD POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE IF THIS CONTINUES THE CONCERN IS THAT THESE CLICKS FOSTER A CULTURE. THAT IS RESISTANCE TO PLEASE REFORM SUCH AS COMMUNITY POLICING. THEY DO SO TO ENCOURAGE. THESE CLICKS ALSO- TO RATE THEM TO A BOTH THE BOTTOM THEY CREATE A VERY AGGRESSIVE TACTICAL APPROACH. USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAINST AGAIN MINORITY COMMUNITIES THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT BEHIND UNDERSCORE NOT BEHIND OFFICERS OF MISCONDUCT BUT THIS IS A CRITICAL AREA TO REFORM POLICE CULTURE WITH IN DEPARTMENTS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT A PROACTIVE ROOTING OUT BAD APPLES AB EIGHT NINE FIVE EIGHT WILL ENSURE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE- POLICIES IN PLACE TO TERMINATE ANY OFFICER WHO THEY FIVE OUTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A WOEFUL PROMOTION ILLICIT ACTIVITIES OF POLICE CLICKS. JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON MY NAME IS RYAN HARRISON I'M A BOARD MEMBER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS. WE REPRESENT OVER SIX THOUSAND ATTORNEYS LAW STUDENTS LAW PROFESSORS AND JUDGES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO I'M A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE FROM SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY WHERE I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CHAIR. OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD. CABLE IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. I'M BUT WE CANNOT DO THIS EFFECTIVELY UNTIL WE HAVE A GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ON THE STREET. AT ITS CORE THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF DIRTY COPS. AND THEIR ENABLERS. TO PROMOTE JUSTICE. AND TO PROMOTE PUBLIC TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GOVERNMENT. ON OCTOBER FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY I JUST FIVE REPORTS WERE COMMITTEE ON POLICE REFORM IN A HIGHLIGHTED THIS CENTRAL ISSUE OF. CLICKS ARE GANGS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE ISSUE OF COPS BENDING THEIR BADGES AND CELEBRATING TWO HOMICIDES IN THE CITY OF VALLEJO. I SPOKE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WITH ALL THE PROLIFERATION OF GANG MEMBERSHIP IN GANGS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THURMOND AND HOW THIS HAS BEEN THIS ISSUE HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN. ADDRESS I'M SUGGEST WE WERE FOR MANY YEARS AND CONTINUES TO BE ADDRESSED AND THIS LEGISLATURE CAN HELP WITH THAT ISSUE WITH THIS BILL. BILL BILL THAT ESSENTIALLY THREE THINGS FOR THE FIRST IS THAT IT REQUIRES AN AGENCY TO MAINTAIN A POLICY. OF THAT- PROHIBITS PARTICIPATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CLICKS. AND MAKES THE GROUNDS FOR THAT VIOLATION OF POLICY- TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT- THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT- REQUIRES AGENCIES TO DISCLOSE- THIS TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT- TO ANOTHER AGENCY CONDUCTING A BACKGROUND CHECK ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT LOST HER JOB AND THE THIRD THING IS THAT IT IS QUALIFY THE OFFICER FROM HOLDING OFFICE AS A PEACE OFFICER OR OTHERWISE ACCEPTING EMPLOYMENT AS A PEACE OFFICER INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA- THE CRITICAL OF FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS ON THE DEFINITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CLICK- WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS- A GROUP OF OFFICERS ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF ROPE ON DUTY BEHAVIOR. THAT VIOLATES THE LAW OR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL POLICING AND IT IT INCLUDES EXAMPLES OF WHAT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS. SECTION THREE SUBSECTION TWO- IT PROVIDES PATENTLY CLEAR EXAMPLES OF DIRTY COP BEHAVIOR- CABLE STANDARD PORT OF THIS BILL AS WRITTEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS- AND WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATURE IN HELPING TO CREATE A LAW ENFORCEMENT REGIME THAT THE PUBLIC CONTRAST THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CONTRAST. THAT INSPIRE AMONG FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED THE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO FACILITATE THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR VITALITY INSTEAD OF CHALLENGING IT.

EUROPEAN A WAVE US TAKEN A LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL STEPS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE HOLDING OUR EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE TO THE RULE OF LAW. WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY GROUP OF EMPLOYEES THE MYSTERY ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY. OR ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT. AB NINE FIFTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE TO ADOPT A POLICY PROHIBITING PARTICIPATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CLICK. ON PROVIDED IT IS GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION FOR PEACE OFFICER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC AND WILL FULLY PROMOTE. FURTHER OR STEP THE CLICK IN ANY ILLICIT ACTIVITY.

YOU KNOW YOU GET ASSIGNED TO SHIPS AND THEIR SHIFT SOMETIMES ARE YOU KNOW YOU DEVELOP CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WORK WITH ANY EVEN DO THINGS OFF DUTY AND I WAS A FIVE IT'S CONCERNED INITIALLY THAT. THAT TYPE OF THING AND THEN BEING FOCUSED. I MEAN BEING. YOU KNOW HAVING PATTERNS OF ARRESTING PEOPLE FOR CAR THEFT OR WHATEVER ON DUTY COULD. TAKE SOME ATTORNEY COULD PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER AND USE IT AGAINST THEM BUT I THINK YOUR BILL IS NARROW ENOUGH AND IT REALLY. FOCUSES IN ON THE- THE CRIMINAL PART OF THIS AND THAT MAKES IT A GOOD BILL AND- SIDE INTEND TO SUPPORT IT AND- THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING IT BECAUSE WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ENSURING THAT. THESE AGENCIES HAVE A CLEAN SHOPS. AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THIS PEOPLE LISTEN TO THESE. THEY MIGHT GET THE IDEA THAT THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S PER VALENT AMONG ALL DEPARTMENTS AND IT REALLY ISN'T- I KNOW PLENTY OF DEPARTMENTS WHERE- DID DID MEMBERS THEMSELVES WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH THIS.

COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I THINK THIS WOULD BE A AGAIN AN EXAMPLE. FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN IT'S A WAY TO MAKING SURE THAT WE- MAKE IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR BAD APPLES TO BE IN THIS PROFESSION- THIS PROFESSION WHO HAS BEEN PAINTED BY WITH A BROAD.

AM THIS MORNING WORKING AND MAKING SURE THIS BILL IS PRESENTABLE TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WE HAVE WORKED OUT AN AGREEMENT WITH SCOPA AND WE HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS AND I WILL BE- THINK THOSE AMENDMENTS YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE- I'VE INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY SIX BECAUSE BANNING I'M TEAR GAS FROM THESE FACILITIES IS A MATTER OF RACIAL JUSTICE AND RESTORING THE DIGNITY FOR YOUTH LIVING WITH DISABILITIES TEAR GAS INSTANTLY MAKES IT HARD. FOR A PERSON TO BRIEF CAUSE INTENSE PAIN AND IS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS DURING THIS PANDEMIC COLBECK NINETEEN ANY USE OF TEAR GAS CAN FACILITATE THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEENTH BOTH WITH IN THE FACILITY AND OUTSIDE WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA IS THE OUT LIAR THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES UNDERSCORE THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES DO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF TEAR GAS AGAINST. YOU IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY SEVEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED BANNING THE USE OF TEAR GAS IN THEIR FACILITIES INCLUDING MARIN NAPA. SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATEO SANTA CRUZ- SANTA CLARA SO NORMAL AND- YEAH THEY THEY HAVE THIS HEAVILY THIS HEAVY USE OF THIS PEPPER SPRAY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OUR- BLACK AND BROWN AND INDIGENOUS YOUTH THESE YOU'VE COME FROM HISTORICALLY. OPPRESSED I'M COMMUNITIES AND ATTEND UNDERFUNDED SCHOOLS LACK ROLE MODELS AND LACK ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT THERE APPEARS HAVE IN OTHER AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES TEAR GAS IS ALSO USED IN DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST YOU WITH DISABILITIES MANY WHO ARE SURVIVAL'S WHO ARE SURVIVING OF SIGNIFICANCE FROM THE ACLU REPORT REPORT FOUND THAT JUVENILE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA USE. TEAR GAS AGENT. MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND TIMES BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. S. IS NOT USED IN ANY OF THE NINE JUVENILE CAMPS IN LOS ANGELES IT IS ONLY USE INTO JUVENILE HALLS IN LA. N. LA COUNTY HAS OUR L. A. COUNTY IS A LARGE JUVENILE POPULATION COMPARED TO ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE THIS CAN BE DONE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES AND SEVERAL- CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. THESE LIFE THREATENING CHEMICALS CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN- REPLACED- AND HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DE ESCALATION- PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO HOW DO YOU APPROACH YOUTH AND SITUATIONS. THAT IS WHY AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE CALL FOR THE END OF THE USE OF THIS AGGRESSIVE MEASURE THIS PEPPER SPRAY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND ENJOY TEN CO AUTHORS JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ALONGSIDE.

OUR MYSTERY GIRL WHO'S IN THE ROOM- YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. LET ME START BY THANKING A SEVEN MEMBER GIPSON HIS STAFF THE SPONSORS FOR. THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND- NEGOTIATIONS ON THE BILL AS AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY RECALL. THIS SUBJECT MATTERS BEEN FOR THE COMMITTEE AT LEAST THREE TIMES THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IF NOT MORE. AND I'VE BEEN I'VE I'VE REPEATEDLY COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUCCESSFULLY MIND YOU- TO STOP THE PASSAGE OF SIMILAR BILLS. AS WE HAD THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR YOU KNOW IT STRUCK THE MEMBERS OF THE FECKLESS PROVISIONAL INNOVATION THAT. THAT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. WE HAD TO WE HAD TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE KIDS QUITE FRANKLY AND I THINK THAT- WHEN THE SPONSORS AND- THE REPRESENTATIVES COOPER MYSELF. CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT WE ALL CARED ABOUT THE SAME THING WHICH WAS BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THESE. YOUNG PEOPLE AND- IN CUSTODY I THINK. THAT REALLY SET US ON OUR WAY. THE ELEMENTS OF THE AGREEMENT I THINK TRY TO BALANCE SEVERAL FACTORS FIRST AND FOREMOST WITH THE SAFETY. OF NOT ONLY THE JUVENILES BUT THE STAFF IN THE FACILITIES. ONE OF THINGS THAT WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IN THESE FACILITIES IS. WHENEVER THERE'S A FIGHT. THE STOPPING RACHEL'S IN CALIFORNIA ARE INADEQUATE AND I THINK THE SPONSORS AGREE WITH THEM THAT'S WHEN THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL AND I THINK AUTHORS STAFF ALSO WOULD AGREE. WITH YOU MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE STOP THEIR TO BILL A BREAK UP FIGHTS QUICKER. THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OFFICERS IN JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE ARE VERY FEW. AND OF A BREAK THE FULL FIGHT BREAKS OUT NOT ONLY TO STOP FURTHER IN A PART OF TEN. KIDS IN THE TWO KIDS ARE IN A FIGHT. THE TO STOP FOR A JOINT. YOU HAVE EIGHT KIDS- UNSUPERVISED. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A RECIPE FOR A GOOD OUTCOME. AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR ESCALATION OF THE VIOLENCE. THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT. PROBATION OFFICERS. DIFFERENT FROM RECORD FACULTY THE PREACHER IF THEY ENTER THE- PROFESSION. BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION AND REENTRY. AND THEY WANT IT WHEN THEY WANT THESE KIDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AS A RESULT OF THAT I BELIEVE THAT. A LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN INTO THE PROFESSIONS PROFESSIONALISM LARGE NOT NONE OF THEM WORKED IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. IN FACT MANY OF THE GIRAFFE TOYS ACROSS THE STATE. OVER. 50% OF THE OFFICERS AS WOMAN. THE WOMAN. MANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE SHORTER IN STATURE. FIVE FOUR THREE FIVE FOUR GOING TO HEAR FROM ONE OF THEM I THINK LATER OF FOR LOCAL SIX THIRTY FIVE. AND THE CHALLENGE BECOMES IF YOU HAVE- YOU KNOW OF IT INTELLECTUALLY A CHILD SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR OLDER. BUT PHYSICALLY THEY COULD BE VERY IMPOSING SIX FOOT THREE TWO ONE FOUR BUT I'VE SEEN THEM I'VE VISITED I KNOW THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BECOMES A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION SO WE TRY TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF THESE OFFICERS THESE BRAVE OFFICERS THAT DO THIS WORK. SO WE BELIEVE WE CAME UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT MAKES SENSE WE WERE INCREASING STAFFING RATIOS AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE BANNING THE USE OF ALL CHEMICAL AGENTS. YOU KNOW TEAR GAS WAS MENTIONED REPEATEDLY. AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE ARE DELAYING THE BAND OF PEPPER SPRAY FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO GET THE L. A. ON OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE BEST PRACTICES NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A OF A BAND OF PEPPER SPRAY AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT THE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS THE MASSIVE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA COMING JUSTICE SYSTEM AS IT PERTAINS TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ALL EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WILL BE HOUSED IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. THAT IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT POPULATION IT'S ENTIRELY NEW POPULATION AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE STATE IS SLOWLY BUT SURELY NOT ONLY GOING OUT OF GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS. OF HOUSING. MINORS UNDER EIGHTEEN BUT NOW THAT THAT AGE LIMIT IS MOVED TO TWENTY FIVE AND THAT'S BASED ON. SCIENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT RATE SETTER WE DON'T DISPUTABLE REDUCE WE DO BELIEVE IN THE AUTHORS AGREED. AND THE SPONSORS AGREE TO THE CREDIT. THAT THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAYBE SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. AND IF THE BAN ON PURPOSE THEY WANT TO PLAY TO THEM. WITH THE WITH ALL THE SAFEGUARDS. WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE COULD. UNFORTUNATELY MEMBERS I CAN'T GUARANTEE THESE OUTCOMES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS FACILITIES AND I'M SCARED. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I'M SCUTTLED CAN HAPPEN WITH THE WOMEN. AND MEN THAT WORK IN THESE FACILITIES. BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS BRING THE BEST PROCESS HAVE COME FOR THE LEGISLATURE. LOOKING AT THIS MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES WERE PROTECTING THE BEST INTERESTS. OF NOT ONLY THE KIDS THAT ARE IN OUR CUSTODY. BUT OUR OFFICERS THAT BRAVELY. GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND WANT TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES. SO ALTHOUGH YOU HEAR FROM OTHER PROVISIONAL CONCESSIONS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I RESPECT THAT. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BECAUSE OF THE TOUGH TOUGH CALL BUT- I'M HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE DAUGHTER SUFFERS. THE SPONSORS EFFORTS. AND THE FECKLESS PROVISIONAL CONCESSIONS. WILL BE NOW IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION AS AMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND CAN WE OPERATE LAST I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A BETTER LINE CAN WE BRING IN THE FIRST WITNESS. TO SEE IF WE CAN HEAR HIM BETTER. MR GUTERRES YOU HAVE WHY DID OUR BACKEND. HELLO YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME DIDN'T IN A WORD THAT YOU'RE TALKING HAS MUCH BETTER NOW IT. THAT'S THAT'S MUCH BETTER SORRY- FIRE FOR THAT PROBLEM IS JUST YOU KNOW.

OKAY SO SHARE MEMBER SHANE TO ME ABOUT THE SITUATION ON COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS WHICH REPRESENTS YOUR COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS- BUT ALSO SHARPLY BENEFITS ASSOCIATION SAMBAR DINO COUNTY WHICH REPRESENTS THE CUTS THE PROBATION OFFICERS OF SAMPOERNA DINO. TO BE A PART FROM L. A. COUNTY WERE TWO OF THE BIGGEST PROBATION APARTMENTS IN THE STATE. I PICKED UP REAL QUICK- I JUST WANT TO SAY I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH MR TO RICO WE TOO ARE SCARED ABOUT THE OUTCOME. OF POTENTIAL IS THE AS A RESULT OF. YOU KNOW THE DISTILLATION OF GOING TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK A COUPLE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION FIST- WHAT WE'RE REALLY DISCUSSING HERE IS OC SPRAY OR PEPPER SPRAY NOT DEBATING AT LEAST ON OUR BEHALF. TEAR GAS BUT TO SEPARATE ISSUE FOR US THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT OUR OFFICERS ABILITY TO CARRY PEPPER SPRAY. TO DEFEND OTHERS OR THEMSELVES. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO THE POPULATION WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS. PREDOMINANTLY HIGH RISK POPULATION ALTHOUGH YOU pALTHOUGH NOT IRREDEEMABLE. ABOUT HIGH RISK SO FOLKS WHO HAVE. GONE THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND BED CONVICTED- FOR MURDER RAPE ETCETERA- SO WE MUST REGRETTABLY OPPOSE SB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON AND THAT'S JUST SAFETY. FOR THE SAFETY OF THE JUVENILE BUT THE PERSONALITIES AND THE SAFETY OF OUR OFFICERS ARE FACILITIES ARE BASICALLY STAFF ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5270% BY FEMALE OFFICERS. UNDER THIS BILL WE'RE GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE THESE OFFICERS WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY SAFETY RECORDS OTHER THAN THEIR BARE HANDS TO DEFEND JUVENILES BEING ATTACKED IN THE FACILITY. FOR DEFENDING THEMSELVES PROPER SPRAY AT THE POLICY MAY ONLY BE USED WHEN THERE IS AN IMMINENT THREAT TO THE SAFETY. OR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS AND ONLY ONE DE ESCALATION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL OR NOT REASONABLY POSSIBLE. UNDER ALMOST EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE UNLESS THERE'S IMMINENT DANGER A WARNING IS ISSUED OF COURSE PHRASE USED. AND OFTEN THIS ONE ALONE IS ENOUGH TO DETER OR STOP PHYSICAL ALTERCATIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE BANNING PEPPER SPRAYS PRUDENT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO VIABLE SAFE ALTERNATIVE. THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION TODAY IMPROVE RATIOS IN THE FACILITY THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL. ARE THERE YOUR RATIOS ARE WELL INTENDED BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE SELDOM FUNDED. IF THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS MISUSED TO PEPPER SPRAY WE'RE COMMITTED TO LOOKING OR STUDYING THAT ISSUE. THAT THERE'S A BETTER WHERE SAFE AWAITING YOU THAT MUCH THAT NIPPLE NOW IN BETTER WAYS. IN ORDER FOR US TO CAN TO A PART SAFETY. AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS YOU HAVE OUR- TO THAT BUT IT OUT RIGHT BANS DOESN'T WORK- FOR THOUSAND BOXER TO GO EVERY DAY. TO PROTECT YOU CAN PROTECT. OKAY THAT WE ASK OUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS UNION ASKING LOCAL SIX EIGHTY FIVE. REPRESENTING OVER THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROBATION OFFICERS HERE IN ALLENTOWN. I ALSO SERVED NOT A MEMBER OF THE CITY OF MONTEREY PARK I'M SPEAKING YOU TODAY IN REGARDS TO EIGHTY ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH ARE UNION STRONGLY UPHOLDS. FIRST LET ME SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY. AB ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE ONE DANGER THE YOUTH ARE CUSTODY. THE CIVILIANS WHO PROVIDE REHABILITATIVE SERVICES INCLUDING COUNTY EMPLOYEES TEACHERS. AND COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PROBATION PEACE OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE. FOR PROVIDING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. IN JANUARY THIS YEAR A YOUTH COUNSELOR AT WAY FINDERS FAMILY SERVICES IN L. A. COUNTY. WAS ATTEMPTING TO BREAK UP A FIGHT. WAS BRUTALLY BEATEN TO DEATH BY SEVEN YOU RESIDENTS. IS FEMALE CO COUNSELOR REPORTEDLY SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION TRYING TO ASSESS. NEITHER AT OC SPRAY AND THE PHYSICAL ATTACK COULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY DIFFUSE THE DOES HE SPRAY WHETHER ACCESSIBLE. IN ANOTHER CASE KABC CHANNEL SEVEN LOCAL NEWS REPORTED THAT WITHIN A THREE. MONTH PERFORMANCE STAND POLITICALLY SAID RESPONDED TO CALLS FOR SERVICE AT THE- FLORENCE CRITTENTON FACILITY FOR GIRLS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TIME. WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SHE DID NO FEEL. SAFE SERVICING THE RESIDENTS. I UNDER NINETY TWO DJJ SO IT IS ALSO A LONG NO LONGER NEW IN CASE. MANIFOLD MELODIC AS WILL USED. FOR HOUSING AND SUPERVISING BEEZY BEEZ DJJ YOU. IF AB ELEVEN SIX FIVE IS BY THE GUY WE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE THE PEPPER SPRAY TO PROTECT THESE COMMIT. TO CIVILIAN TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THOSE OF US DEPUTIZED TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND PROVIDING REHABILITATIVE TREATMENT. WORKING OUT FOR US HERE IN L. A. COUNTY IS THAT THE FACILITY YOU ARE FEMALE. LOCAL THIRTY FIVE HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE SAFETY AND THE JUVENILE HALLS AND CAMPS. AND THE DOCTOR GIVING A RATIO NEEDED TO PROTECT THE YOUTH IN OUR CARE. THE CIVILIAN TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND OUR MEMBERS. THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO WORK AND VOLUNTEER PROBATION SERVICES. WE URGE YOU TO AMANDA ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE TO CONDUCT A MEANINGFUL STUDY OF CURRENT PROTOCOLS REGARDING OC SPRAY. AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE SAFETY OF ALL PARTIES BEFORE AN OUTRIGHT BAN HAS BEEN ENACTED. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE STUDY INCORPORATE CURRENT POLICIES IN SMALL MEDIUM LARGE URBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH MAY BE SUB OPTIMAL. WE FURTHER RECOMMEND A PILOT PROGRAM TO TEST THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE JUVENILES IN OUR CHAIR THE TEACHERS SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND OTHERS ENTER JUVENILE PROBATION FACILITIES EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND THE DEDICATED PROBATION PEACE OFFICERS WHO WORK HARD TO PROVIDE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WE'VE GOT NINE ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S IT FOR OPPOSITION- NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO COMMITTEE WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER SEA HER UP TO TALK ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. NEED TO BEAT TOP AND BOTTOM- AND I KNOW IT'S LATE AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME BUT- THESE THESE HAVE TO BE EXPLORED SO I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION. SO WITHOUT THE USE OF THIS IS ONE OF THE METHODS OF THE LESS THAN LETHAL FORCE OF BREAKING SOMETHING UP WHAT'S LEFT. HOW DO HOW DO THEY CONTROL A GROUP OF TWENTY FIVE. LARGE JUVENILES. I HAVE IN A BRAWL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION- ONE I WANT TO- CAL RECOUNTS THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE BANNED THE USE OF THIS SPRAY PEPPER SPRAY BEING USED SEVEN. COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BANNED IT BY UTILIZING OTHER METHODS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO WE LOOK AT THESE BEST PRACTICES ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW. IT IS NOT OUR DESIRE PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT OUR DESIRE TO PUT ANYONE IN HARM'S WAY. BUT CALIFORNIA'S OUT LIAR CALIFORNIA HAS NOT LED INTO SPACE. THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES IN THE UNION HAS ALREADY BANNED IT BUT UTILIZING OTHER METHODS TO CONTROL THE SITUATION WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER METHODS THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WELL SOME OF THOSE MATH THAT SOME THOSE METHODS ARE BEHAVIORAL MEET.% OUR BEHAVIOR CONTROL- SOME OF THEM ARE ABSOLUTELY- TESTING AND SPEAKING TO THE U. R. RAISE THEIR VOICES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER. LET ME JUST GET REAL QUICK I'M USED IPAD TRYING TO USE THAT PHRASE OF THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US- TODAY. WE HAVE YET THEY HAVE USED AND I DON'T. SEE IT HERE IN MY NOTES PROBABLY MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION THAT WHAT THE OTHER THIRTY FIVE AND THE OTHER SEVEN COUNTIES IN THE STATE ARE USING THOSE KINDS OF METHODS TO DE ESCALATE. THE SITUATION NOT LET THEM HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOT AT LAMPEN FIRST WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE MASS CASUALTY LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT THE KIDS WITH BROKEN ARMS KIDS WITH CONCUSSIONS KIDS WITH LACERATIONS- IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND GET KIDS TO. AND THAT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM AND IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THE OFFICER IS THE DECADES OF DEAD KIDS YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GOES TOO FAR AND THEY GET A HEAD INJURY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY CAN THEY YOU KNOW. TWENTY SEVEN LASTED CANNOT KIDS WHO KILL HERE AND- SO I ASK A QUESTION OR MAKE A STATEMENT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING TO EACH YEAR. I AM TRYING TO- WHEN YOU GET HIT ON THE HEAD WITH A CHAIR. THAT CAN RESULT IN YOUR DEATH. I HAVEN'T DONE THE INVESTIGATIONS TO SEE WHERE THE WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED- BUT I KNOW WE HAVE HAD THOSE TYPE OF INCIDENTS OR RESPOND TO A PRESENT. AND THERE IS A MASS CASUALTY BASICALLY THAT MEANS MORE THAN. A COUPLE OF PATIENTS. AND THERE BECAUSE OF THESE INCIDENTS. AND WE DO HAVE OFFICERS THAT ARE FIVE SIX AND HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS. THAT ARE FACED WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE TWENTY TWICE THEIR SIZE. AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR MAYES TO PROTECT THEM. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR VOICE TRYING TO TALK SOMEBODY OUT OF. BEATING THEM UP OR IN YOU KNOW FOR INFLICTING HARM ON THEM IS GONNA TO SOLVE THAT. SO WITHOUT WITHOUT SOME OTHER MEANS OF IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLING AN OUT OF CONTROL EVENT OTHER THAN JUST YELLING HEY YOU GUYS STOP IT. THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THOSE KIDS ARE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO KEEP THEM SAFE REHABILITATE THEM BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO HAVE METHODS THAT ARE LESS THAN LETHAL METHODS. TO MAKE THAT ENVIRONMENT SAFE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE END GOAL WHICH IS THEY GET OUT AND THEY'RE BETTER. SOME OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- THEY'VE WITNESSED TALKED ABOUT- I APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS AND I HOPE THEY WORK. AND IF THEY DO WORK THEN EVENTUALLY. THERE WON'T BE A NEED FOR ANYBODY TO USE. THE PEPPER SPRAY. BUT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT IN PLACE UNTIL WE KNOW THAT WORKS I CAN'T IMAGINE TAKING AWAY ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT IS SUCCESSFUL AND HELPING CONTROL THAT TYPE OF INCIDENT. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS PEPPER SPRAY YES IS IT UNCOMFORTABLE YEP. I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO PEPPER SPRAY BUT I'M GLAD I WAS BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE WAS WHATEVER INCIDENT WERE AND GETS OUT OF CONTROL. AND I AM I AM I LOSE. AND SO- YES IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND YES YOU CAN YOU CAN GET IT WASHED OUT YOUR EYES. AND IT'LL GO ON- BUT WITHOUT A TOOL IN THEIR TOOL BELT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE WITHOUT FURTHER INJURING ANYBODY BY RESTRAINING OR DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM SURE AND IT'S NOT SAFE. GOOD SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S JUST. IT'S NOT INTERESTED OF SAFETY. NOW IT'S NOT FAIR BUT IT'S NOT SAFE AND SAFETY TRUMP'S FAIRNESS TO ME. AND IF I CAN KEEP. IT OUT. BILL THANK YOU YOU CAN RESPOND TO IT NOW ARE YOU CLOSE BUT OKAY OKAY YOU. ALTHOUGH MY CLOSER YOUR PLAYERS OKAY OTHER MY CLOSE THANK YOU AND- JUST FOR THE RECORD MISTER SUCH CHARACTERS YOUR MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE YOU CAN SPEAK AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU WANT. MISTER WORK STILL HAS THE RECORD FOR THE MOST QUESTIONS SO YOU GOT SOME TIME. FIVE NINE YEARS. I DO WANT TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU AND JUST SAY THAT IN TALKING WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SAID OF THE PEPPER SPRAY IS THERE IT WILL BE USED AND SHE WANTS SHE TOLD ME SHE'S VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS AND IF THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES AND SIX GUYS CAN DO IT ALAMEDA COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES CAN AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER REBEKAH PARKADE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I WANT IT I WANTED TO GO OVER FOR A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THAT. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT ALL OF US HERE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE REHABILITATION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE FACILITIES AND ESPECIALLY OF OUR JUVENILES. AND TO MY COLLEAGUE- MR KIRK'S POINTS SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY GET WHAT WE WANT OUT OF IT AND WHEN. THESE YOUTH ARE BEING HELD IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE BEING SPRAYED WITH PEPPER SPRAY BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EDUCATING AND REHABILITATING THEM. THAT'S NOT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY'RE HAVING AND I REALLY ACTUALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MR TRIGO BOTH FOR BEING HERE IN PERSON. AND FOR HIS WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I DO THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT I THINK WE NEED TO GET AND WE YOU KNOW WE MOVED THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE WANT TO CHANGE IT. GOING TO MAKE IT ONE OF REHABILITATION EDUCATION AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE AN HEARING THE THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT BEFORE US. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT HEARING THAT THE WORLD IS FINE I THINK IT'S GREAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUING AN ONGOING WORK YOU AND I SPOKE BEFORE THIS HEARING ABOUT HOW. YOU ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THESE FACILITIES TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN FEEL SAFE WHERE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED. AND READIES JUVENILES ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WILL BE REHABILITATED AND FEEL LIKE THEY CAN BE AND I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE THAT WORK AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND AS A RESULT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE OTHER.% IMAGE IF YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MEMBERS AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR THEIR ROBUST CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL I WANT ALSO THANK EDGAR- GUTERRES WHOSE THE YOUNG MAN WHO SPOKE WE TALKED ABOUT- HE'S DONE THE BAD THINGS AS WELL LET HIM INTO- ONE OF THESE FACILITIES BUT ALSO WE DESCRIBE- BEING USED- UNJUSTLY FOR MINORSITUATIONS THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED THERE AND THAT'S WE WANT TO TRY TO STOP WE WANT TO PROHIBIT- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THESE FACILITIES FROM BEING FURTHER TRAUMATIZE SO THEY CAN START THE ROLE IN THEIR JOURNEY IN TERMS OF REHABILITATION. IT WAS ASK THE QUESTION WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE IN TERMS OF IF PEPPER SPRAY IS REMOVED WELL THERE ARE CERTAINLY PHYSICAL- FORCE- TECHNIQUES- THAT ARE PROVED THAT YOU CAN USE TO RESTRAIN IT AN INDIVIDUAL- THERE ARE THERE ARE CRISIS METHODS THERE ARE CONFLICTS- MANAGEMENT RESOLUTIONS THERE'S DE ESCALATION TACTICS ALL THAT ARE TRAINED BY PROBATION OFFICERS TO USE SO THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO TO THESE PARTICULAR STRINGS TO TRY TO RESTRAIN AND TRY TO CONTROL THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL HOLES THEY ARE TAKE DOWN MATHIS AND RESTRAINT METHODS METHODS THAT CAN BE USED AND HAVE BEEN USED TO UP TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY CONTROL THE SITUATION. AND REDUCE THE HARM TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINOR BUT ALSO TO THE PROBATION OFFICER AS WELL I UNDERSTAND THIS THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO PUT ANYONE IN JEOPARDY I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR A LONG TIME UP UNTIL ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND SO- WE JUST LEARNED OPPOSITION ON YESTERDAY AND I ASKED FOR LANGUAGE I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- SIX EIGHTY FIVE REPRESENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY- WE INVITE THEM TO THE TABLE- TO HELP US MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A LANGUAGE THAT THEY FEEL THAT IS SUITABLE THAT CAN NOT PUT ANYONE IN HARM'S WAY NOT ONLY- THE JUVENILE BUT ALSO THE PROBATION OFFICER AS WELL. AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK EXTREMELY. HARD IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE- TO A POSITION. OF THE THIS THIS- THIS BILL- ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU YOU GENERALLY WANT TO GET TO A PLACE. WHERE THE NEW TECHNIQUES AS MY- COLLEAGUE SAID STARTS TO TAKE ROOT IT'S HARD. TO DO SOMETHING NEW IT'S JUST. ANYTHING YOU DO WHICH IS HARD AT IT WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO YOU MISTER GIBSON IS I KNOW YOU NAME SOME THINGS THAT COULD REPLACE IT WE YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE DEMONSTRATIONS YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEE IT FEEL IT TOUCH IT. ESPECIALLY ARE FOR BASED I JUST SAY OUR PROBATION OFFICERS IN LA THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY SPEAK MAYBE ME ATHLETES SEE IT. AND GET FELLMAN AND TALK TO THOSE PROBATION OFFICER OUT OF STATE OR AROUND WHO ARE USING IT SO THEY CAN GET SOME COMFORT LEVEL BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT NEW TECHNIQUES SO- THAT NEVER DO AND- I ALSO WOULD SAY. IF WE NEED TO RE EXAMINE STAFFING RATIOS- WE SHOULD IS IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE ON PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET IF STAFFING RATIOS ARE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE USED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE SAFE THEN IF WE NEED TO INCREASE THAT. BUDGET RISE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TOO SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO ADD TO IT TO MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER AND ALSO JUST KIND OF- YOU KNOW I GOT THIS DISCUSSION OF PEPPER SPRAY NOT TO PURPOSE RAY- WHETHER NOT IT HURTS YOUTH. N. AS AS SOME DETRIMENTAL OR IS IT OVER USE IS AN AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND TECHNIQUES LET'S HAVE THAT TEXT DISCUSSION BECAUSE IF IT. JUST COMES DOWN TO- INDIVIDUALS YOU IT AND- OR OVER USING NET. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. THAN ALL OF ITS BAD SO WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE THAT. THAT DISCUSSION AND SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE SO I. I THINK WE DO YOU WORKED ON IT HE WORKED AT UNION ANYONE TO BRING EVERYBODY IN THE TAP- I THINK WE SHOULD. BE FAIR TO BOTH THE PROBATION OFFICERS. TO THE KIDS AND TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THAT WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION DID EVERYBODY COME TO THE TABLE LIKE YOU WANT ABSALOM TO IT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ABSOLUTELY. ALTHOUGH WE'RE COMMITTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLARIFICATION- THESE DAYS. AMENDMENTS THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT WILL NOT BE TAKEN. IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT AS IT MOVES FORWARD SO.

FIFTY NINE IS A BILL ABOUT. THANK YOU I'LL KEEP IT REALLY SHORT IT'S A BILL ABOUT KEEPING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHOLE BY PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATIONS. BASED ON FAULTY GROUNDS- CURRENT LAW ALREADY SAYS A SOMEONE'S UNAWARE OF AN ADVERSE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES A CHARGE. THAN THAT CONVICTION IS LEGALLY INVALID AND OUR LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW A FEW YEARS AGO- FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT PROCESS IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO WERE CONVICTED BY PLEA BARGAIN. NOT FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED BY TRIAL- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR PURSUING THEIR JURY TRIAL. AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU- AND YOUR WITNESSES. TO ROAST CAL AND MY NAME IS HELLO MY NAME IS ROSE HI AND I AM THAT SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER WHERE I SPECIALIZED IN POST CONVICTION RELIEF FOR IMMIGRANTS.

THANK YOU ALSO TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY FOR PASSING A BE THIRTEEN AND SUBSEQUENTLY AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY SEVEN. FEET LAST CREATING AND CLARIFYING PENAL CODE SECTION FOURTEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT SEVEN HEADBANDS QUITE LITERALLY LIKE FADING FOR THOUSANDS OF THE DEFENCE STAND NONPARTISAN. WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SEPARATE THAT INDELIBLE IMPACT. OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONNECTION. NOW IT'S TIME TO CLOSE THE FINAL LOOPHOLE LEFT IN FOURTEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT SEVEN AND EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE ALL THE ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS TO ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE CONVICTED BY TRIAL. THE ONLY 2% OF PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED BY TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA AND EVEN SMALLER PERCENTAGE ELIGIBLE KERR RELEASED UNDER THE FACT YEAR I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU LIKE ME BELIEVE THAT NO PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW SMALL SHOULD SUFFER FROM AN OLD ILLEGAL CONNECTION. K. INDIVIDUALS LEFT OUT REPRESENT VERY REAL PEOPLE INCLUDING THAT GRAHAM A FATHER OF THREE WHO HAS LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES AS A GREEN CARD HOLDER SINCE HE WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. SACRAMENTO CURRENTLY IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS BASED ON A SINGLE MARIJUANA CONVICTION FROM SIX YEARS AGO. THAT HAS SINCE BEEN REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR. BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE WAS CONVICTED BY A JURY TRIAL. GRAHAM WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT HIS CONVICTION WAS ILLEGAL AND STOP HIS DEPORTATION. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT LOOPHOLE IN FOURTEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT SEVEN HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT CHANCE AND IT'S TAKEN MANDATORY PERMANENT AND LYFT HAD SEPARATION FROM HIS FAMILY. THIS CLEAN UP IS SIMPLE THERE IS NO WBC. WHICH IS WHY IT HAS TO DATE ENGENDERED NO OPPOSITION AND HAS DRAWN SUPPORT FROM DA OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING THE ALTHOUGH COUNTY SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO THE PROCESS IN THE PROSECUTOR'S ALLIANCE.

WORK AT A SAN DIEGO. CA OUR TOWN THEY ARE TEN NO WICKS. LI LI I. MATCHES ARE CALL NEED TO AND MORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MOVING TO AB FORTY ONE AB FORTY WOULD ANYONE WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT IN A POST GEORGE FORD WORLD WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW EQUIPMENT AND TACTICS IMPACT THAT PARTNERSHIP. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AMONG THE TOP STATES WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY WEAPONRY OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS PROCURED INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT LINK BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS OBTAINED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE NUMBER OF POLICE SHOOTINGS. LAST SUMMER WE ALSO SAW AN ALARMING RANGE OF EQUIPMENT IN ACTION DURING PEACEFUL PROTESTS WHEN POLICE SPRAY TEAR GAS FOR MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND SHOT RUBBER BULLETS FROM ARMORED VEHICLES. THE DECISIONS OF HOW TO IMPROVE TO DEPLOY THE SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WERE LEFT UP TO INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AT THE SCENE WITHOUT UNIFORM PROTOCOLS WHICH WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE. IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. THIS BILL ASKED POLICE TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNING BOARDS TO COME UP WITH APPROPRIATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT POLICIES THAT CAN BE DELIBERATED AND APPROVED IN A PUBLIC SETTING. NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT ANY MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM BEING USED IF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNING BOARDS WERE TO DECIDE THAT WITH OUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN AND WHY POLICE BELIEVE THEY NEED MILITARY CALIBER COMMITMENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN PUBLIC DOLLARS BEING USED TO PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. K. I HAVE A DOMINIQUE ARCHIBALD.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHO SHALL MATURE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR EIGHTY ONE. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER JACK CONDITION OF MILITARY SURPLUS PROPERTY. OFTEN REQUIRES BIDDERS TO RESPOND QUICKLY WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE A LEGISLATIVE BODY REGARDING EACH PURCHASE. EVEN IF THE BILL ONLY APPLIES FIRST HìNH AGENCY SEEKS TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN EQUIPMENT EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE WOULD FEEL SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIA AGENCIES IN THEIR ATTEMPT AT PARTICIPATION ADDITIONALLY THE TYPE OF PROPERTY CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY FAST AND INCLUDES ITEMS COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU HELLACOPTERS COMMAND AND CONTROL VEHICLE REACHING APPARATUS AND RIDE HOME MAKING SHIELDS HOWEVER EVEN IF THE MEASURE LACKS IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF WHAT EQUIPMENT IS INCLUDED WE WOULD REMAIN OPPOSED EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY UP INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED CONSTITUENT CONFESSIONAL OFFICERS TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT AT A COST SAVING. FOR THE APPOINTMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES NEARLY ELECTED SHERIFFS ARE CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO THE CONCERNS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE PURCHASING AND DEPLOYMENT OF APPROPRIATE. EQUIPMENT SHOULD THEY ARISE. FURTHER THE BILL ABOUT REQUIRE MAN THAT LONG FOR AT ONLY DESCRIBE HOW AND WHERE SAID YOU. WAS USED THAT ALSO AND NOW IT UP ANY CRITICAL. IT'S VERY IN OTHER WORDS BURST INTO. THAT THE USE OF KNOWLEDGE EQUIPMENT MAY HAVE HAD ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY WELFARE CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES AND ON ANY COMMUNITY OAKLAND THESE PROVISIONS ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME AND PRESUPPOSES INAPPROPRIATELY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT USE THAT DECIDED QUIT MEANT AND TECHNOLOGY NECESSARILY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES- AS YOU ALL KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED. EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE IT SIMILAR BILLS THAT DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO REQUIRE GOVERNING BODY APPROVAL FOR THE ACQUISITION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN HIS VETO MESSAGE SHE STAYED AT THE CURRENT LET'S NOT ONLY INCLUDE ITEMS THAT ARE CLEARLY MILITARISTIC IN STYLE. THAT MANY THAT ARE COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DO NOT MAIL ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO THEIR ACQUISITION- IN MY VIEW THIS BILL CREATES AN UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC HURDLE WITHOUT COMMENSURATE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND I CANNOT FIND IT.

SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES ON THE COLOR OF. CONFERENCING IN OPPOSITION STE SENAD LOOK. THIS WOULD. AND WE ARE WITH DEFAULT SO NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MR LACKEY. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY I AGREE WITH THE- THE VETO MESSAGE THAT WAS SHARED BY. THE THE MEMBERS OF THE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SHE ALREADY READ THE QUOTES I WON'T READ IT AGAIN. BUT ESSENTIALLY OF THE TYPE OF PROPERTY THAT'S- CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL- INCLUDES ITEMS COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO THREATEN THE BILL DOESN'T CENTRALIZES THE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE ACQUISITION OF EQUIPMENT BY STE ACTUALLY STALI LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO APPLY FOR TOOLS AND SUPPLIES AT NO COST AND THE DEFEND THEM. SO I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU TO SIT THERE SHERATON THANK YOU. SORRY YOU KNOW IF WE DID HAVE A GENEVA CONVENTION FOR CALIFORNIA THEN BOTH SIDES WOULD AGREE TO NOT DO IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE SITUATION HERE- ONE SIDE DOES NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO- SO THAT THAT ARGUMENT FALLS KIND OF SHORT ON ME- HAVING WATCH THIS INVOLVED OVER THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR SO- I CAN TELL YOU ARE COMES FROM IT COMES FROM POLICE SHOWING UP. BEING BADLY OUTGUNNED AND OUTMANNED BY ARE JUST OUTGUNNED. BY CRIMINALS WHO HAD FAR SUPERIOR WEAPONS THAT THEY OBTAINED ON THE ILLEGAL MARKET. AGAIN THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND THE PUBLIC AGAINST THEM. AND SO THEY STARTED GOING INTO GETTING- BETTER EQUIPMENT AND THAT BETTER EQUIPMENT COMES WITH THE COST FORTUNATELY THE MILITARY ALREADY HAD A LOT OF THAT BETTER EQUIPMENT AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO TAP INTO THOSE. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THIS STARTED- THEY WOUND UP WITH SWAT TEAMS AND THEY WOUND UP WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT TYPES OF. SPECIALTY TEAMS THAT DEALT WITH SPECIALTY ISSUES. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY A LOT OF THE THIS EQUIPMENT IS USED FORCE. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT THE POLICE NEED TO BE AS WELL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE AS THE CRIMINALS. AND YOU KNOW IT HAVING BEEN ON A CITY COUNCIL FOR A LONG TIME WITH A BRAND NEW POLICE DEPARTMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY THEY PURCHASE SOME EQUIPMENT. AND NOT ONE TIME WAS THAT- SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT BY THE CITY COUNCIL- IF THEY'RE SOMETHING ON CONSENT CALENDAR YOU SIMPLY PULL IT OFF CONSENT CALENDAR AND GET MORE INFORMATION- SO. YOU KNOW IF I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY WE KEEP HAND COPPING. OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND TRYING TO KEEP US AS A PUBLIC SAFE. AND IN THIS IS JUST ONE MORE. TOOL THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAVE US MONEY. AND HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED IN THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND US AGAINST THE BAD GUYS. AND THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT THERE AND- AND THEY DON'T CARE WHAT WE THINK SO. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE OF THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UP WITH PARQUET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- QUESTION- SO THE BILL THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK TRANSPARENCY AND THE ABILITY FOR THE GOVERNING BODIES TO DECIDE WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS SENATE'S- OWN RANKS MAKE SENSE TO ME. BUT THE BILL HERE SHOULD DO TWO THINGS WHICH I PUT FORTH A POLICY THAT THEN THAT THE LAWN FIRST NEED TO ABIDE BY BUT ALSO CONTAINS THAT EVERY TIME THEY ENGAGE IN OUR OF P. THAT THEY GOT TO GET THAT THINK IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE APPROVED AND IT SEEMS TO ME IF THERE'S A POLICY IN PLACE THAT. DRAWS THE CONFINES OF WHAT IS AND IS NOT APPROPRIATE I'M SORT OF FEELING THE SHERIFF HERE THEN WHY DO THEY NEED TO STALL THE PROCESS TO GO GET THAT HELICOPTER HE WILL. EXPLAIN THAT YES SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME LET ME JUST AGREE WITH SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NOT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY'S BILL- THAT- THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ON THE STREET TO CALIFORNIA WE WANT- ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE AS WELL EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION I JUST WANNA MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT FORBID. THE BILL FOR ENFORCEMENT TO OBTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT- WHAT THIS SAYS IS THE- CONCEPT OF THIS BILL IS. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC PROCESS WHERE THERE IS A DECISION MADE ABOUT- HOW THOSE WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED AND WHEN THEY'RE GONNA BE USED AND LET'S HAVE A PROCESS. AND UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED- SO THAT'S THAT'S THE CORE OF THIS- WE HAVE PUT IN SOME PROCESS HERE AND- TO OUR OUR COLLEAGUES POINT- WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EXACTLY HOW THAT GETS STRUCTURED. BUT I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE WANT TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY BOTH AND WHEN THIS EQUIPMENT IS OBTAINED AND WHEN IT'S USED WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME VALUATION THAT THAT'S- FUNDAMENTALLY AT THE CORE- AND- AND AGAIN WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT THAT APPRECIATE- THAT THERE ARE SOME- REPRESENTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE ARE ENGAGING WITH TO REALLY TIGHTEN THIS UP- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK THAT THERE OUGHT TO NOT BE. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARDS TO THIS AND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT- THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO THINK THAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL AGREE OUR STREETS SHOULD NOT BE WAR ZONES CITIZENS ARE NOT ENEMY COMBATANTS- AND THERE ARE FOLKS WHO. WOULD LOVE TO BAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT IS AGAIN NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES WERE ESTABLISHING ESTABLISHING PROCESS. THANK YOU M. SO I MEAN I. AGREE WITH YOU THAT I THINK THIS BILL IS. IS NARROWED IN SCOPE IN A WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATE I MEAN THE PART THAT SAYS THAT THE GOVERNING BODY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE PURCHASE IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OF ALTERNATIVES WE SHOULD DO THAT WITH EVERYTHING THAT. I THOUGHT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PIECE OF IT. I DON'T THINK WE DO THAT OFTEN ENOUGH. IN USING HARD EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A WAY TO NARROW IT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNING BODY CREATES THIS POLICY BUT ALSO ENABLES. THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO GO OUT AND GET THESE PIECES WILL COME WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON SHORT NOTICE I DON'T THINK THOSE TWO THINGS ARE INCONSISTENT AND SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASILY FIXED AND THE STUFF. AND I WOULD SAY BECAUSE THIS WAS A PROBABLY THE ONE MAIN ISSUE RAISED BY. THE SHERIFF'S AND THEIR OPPOSITION THAT I ALSO SUPPORT WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE POLICY PROCESS THAT DELAYS THE ABILITY TO GET IT. WHAT WE ARE ASKING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THOUGH IS. IF YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THERE MIGHT. BECOME A PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS GET PRIOR APPROVAL SO THAT YOU'RE READY TO GO WHEN THAT OPPORTUNITY COMES UP. IF IT TURNS OUT. THAT THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT LET'S HAVE A PROCESS TO DEAL WITH THAT EXISTENCE CIRCUMSTANCE I'M OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION. BUT THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING A PROCESS- TO CONTEMPLATE THIS THAT'S WHAT. THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK. THIS BILL IS ABOUT. K. YOUR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISTER MISTER TO MAKE I JUST WANT TO FIRST APPRECIATE- ALL OUR COALITION FOR WAITING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS I REALLY DO ALSO APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE FOR HOW MANY HOURS YOU WORK IN- IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES- I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND I WILL SAY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- WE ARE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION OF HOW TO DO THIS IN A REASONABLE WAY BUT AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND THE REASON WE'RE DOING THAT IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO REBUILD COMMUNITY TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY THIS TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY WILL HELP TO FURTHER THAT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. IT THANK YOU MISTER. MR CHEW UP I THINK- MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE YOU ARE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M GLAD THEY GAVE ME TO HISTORY. OF WHY THEY NEEDED THE EQUIPMENT I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW. ABOUT THE WHO WHAT WHERE WHY IT I THINK WILL HELP WITH YOU COMING TO A LANDING SPOT. WHAT I WANT THEM ALSO TO REMEMBER. DURING MY TIME IN LA IN A CRACK COCAINE TIME IN LA THE MILITARY. THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS USED IN MY AREA WHERE I LIVE THE BATTERY AMENT OTHER THINGS WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AN INNOCENT PEOPLE. WERE HURT INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE KILLED. IN RAIDS AND THAT'S WHERE THIS COMES FROM ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. LAPD HAD THIS EQUIPMENT AND I THINK DELEGATION EVEN PROBABLY SAID IT WAS NOT IN YOUR BUSINESS HE PROBABLY SAYS SOMETHING ELSE A LITTLE HARSHER SO THAT'S- WHY YOUR BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AS FAR AS TRANSPARENCY SO THAT SAID THE CITY COUNCIL AND LARA FORCE WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. MAKE A DECISION. ONE MAKES THEIR CASE THE OTHER MAKES THEIR CASE AND HOPEFULLY CAN LAND IN A PLACE WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE SAFE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO RESIDENTS CAN BE SAFE ALSO AND THAT WE WORK OUT A SYSTEM WHERE DOES MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE BACK DURING THOSE BAD CRACK COCAINE DAYS- WILL NOT REOCCUR AND I THINK THAT'S- THIS PUSH. FROM THE OTHER SIDE THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO REMEMBER THOSE DAYS AND REMEMBER THAT A MILITARY EQUIPMENT ON THE STREETS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS- DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT BECAUSE THIS THIS IS A GOOD DISCUSSION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AND- AND RECOMMEND A AYE VOTES WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD. IF BACK MOTION.TO MOVED TO BILL. OUR SECOND. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED IN SENATE ON EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE BY SEVEN MEMBER CHU THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER GENSER IRAQI BACKING NOW BARRICADE HAND BAKKIE HAD AYE CORK. QUICK I SAN DIEGO SAY OUR TENT OUT THERE TO KNOW WICKS. WICKS I BELIEVE WE I. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU COLLEAGUES MISSED DERIDE TREATISE. MISTER RODRIGUEZ AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY EMPLOYERS PROHIBITED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ARREST OR DETENTION. SH YOU MAY BE GIVE MR RODRIGUEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY WHICH WOULD ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE ARREST INFORMATION FOR SPECIFIC NON SWORN EMPLOYEES A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO AB SEVEN THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO FROM LAST SESSION WHICH THIS COMMITTEE PASSED ON CONSENT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY TO COMPLETE A BACKGROUND CHECK ON APPLICANTS FOR NON SWORN POSITIONS AND ASKED INDIVIDUAL ABOUT PRIOR ARREST. HOWEVER DUE TO A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW ONCE AN APPLICANT IS HIRED THE AGENCY CANNOT REQUEST OR RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT A NON SWORN EMPLOYEE ABOUT ANY FUTURE ARREST THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WOULD ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO INVESTIGATE WHEN NON SWORN EMPLOYEES ARRESTED WHICH WOULD HELP SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE SHOP. MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. RUSSIA WHICH WOULD BE READY TO GO. CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. I'M NOT SURE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- SPONSORS OF ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN EIGHTY. LOW DO WE LOSE THEIR. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR OFFERING THIS AT ALL AND- HE WANTED TO- JUST CANNOT THINK OF TIME I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT- MADE FOURTH THREE. POINT SEVEN PROHIBITS ASKING EMPLOYEES ABOUT ARREST RECORDS THAT DID NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION HOWEVER PERCENT ALREADY EMPLOYED ACT PEACE OFFICER THE PERSON SEEKING EMPLOYMENT FOR POSITIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY AS DEFINED IN PENAL CODE. THIRTEEN ONE OH ONE ARC LAMPS FROM LABOR CODE FOR THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN THESE PROVISIONS IN THE LAW ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO COMPLETE A BACKGROUND CHECK ON APPLICANTS FOR NON SWORN POSITION AND ASK ABOUT. PRIOR ARRESTS BUT ONCE THEY ARE HIRED A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DO YOU DRAW THE POLE INTO LAW CAN NO LONGER QUESTIONED. THEM ABOUT THE FUTURE- LAST. THERE IS A COMPANION IN PENAL THIRTEEN TO. THAT L. SIX WOMEN JUSTICE AGENCY TO IF CONCERNING UNDERGRAD WE'LL GET PENSION TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THE PEACE OFFICER BUT NOTHING ADDRESSES NONCHALANT EMPLOYEES UP THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND OF COURSE AND WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING ETHICAL AND CONSCIENTIOUS PERSON NOW IS PIVOTAL. TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NO MATTER THEIR RANK OR TITLE. SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONSISTENT TRUSTWORTHY RELATIONSHIP. WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY MAX OUT THE NECESSARY MEANS TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE- WESTRAC CARD FOR CERTAIN NON SWORN EMPLOYEES. PROCESS IN SHORT EQUITY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE REASONS HE HAS FAITH PRESCHOOL SPONSOR AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY AND WE FIGHT THINK AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ CO AUTHORING THE BILL THANK YOU.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK GOD LIKE YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON OUR NEW SET OF AMENDMENTS AND I ALSO WANT TO BEGIN BY LETTING THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION AND DECIDED TO CROSS AMENDMENTS TO REINCORPORATE GREAT BODILY INJURY WHICH IS PENAL CODE TWELVE ZERO TO TWO POINT SEVEN BACK INTO THE VIOLENT FELONY IN THIS SO APPRECIATIVE OF OPPOSITIONS HIGHLIGHTING OF THAT CONCERN. NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IS INSTITUTIONAL RACISM REFERS TO THE WAYS WHICH POLICIES SUCH AS THE ONES WE DEBATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO CREATE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS MANY POLICIES THAN SHRINE INSTITUTIONAL RACISM OR LARGELY ENACTED IN THE ERA OF TOUGH ON CRIME A MOVEMENT DRIVEN BY FEAR AND RACISM ONE GLARING EXAMPLE INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IS THE USE OF A SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS PARTICULARLY FIRE ON BEHANCE WHAT'S WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS TO OF COLOR. THERE AREN'T ANY CREDIBLE STUDIES THAT DETAIL HOW MUCH HOW THE DETAIL MUCH HIGHER RATE OF FIREARM USAGE WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS YET ENHANCEMENTS ARE APPLIED TO PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHAT THE ANTI SENT ANTI RACISM SENTENCING REFORM ACT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO IS DISMANTLE THIS LEGAL MONUMENT TO RACISM BY REDUCING THE SENTENCE BY REDUCING SENTENCE ADD ONS. FOR FIREARMS THAT ESSENTIALLY PUNISH PEOPLE MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE SAME CRIME. THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS ON OUR PENAL CODE AND IT IS ONLY FIELD MASS INCARCERATION FOR DECADES WITHOUT DETERRING CRIME OR MAKING US ANY SAFER. IN FACT IF MARK IF MASS INCARCERATION ENHANCEMENTS WORKED WOULD BE THE SAFEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH WITH 25% OF. OUR POPULATION BECAUSE WE COMPARE OUR 25% OF ALL THE CARS ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD COMPARED A ONLY HAVING FIVE PERCENT. OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. IN THIS BILL WE TAKE A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO IMPROVE OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MAKE THEM SAFER BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING TOUGH ON CRIME REALLY OUGHT TO BE SMART ON CRIME. AND THE DATA IS CLEAR. EXTREME PRISON TERMS HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN DETERRING CRIME AND CONVERSELY. FOR EACH ADDITIONAL YEAR SENTENCING YOU CAN INCREASE RECIDIVISM BY 47% I REDUCING THE USE OF SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE NO PUNITIVE ACTIONS TAKEN FOR CRIMES EITHER. PEOPLE STILL SERVE OUT THEIR STATUTORY SENTENCES FOR THE CRIMES THEY DECIDED TO COMMIT. IF THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A SAFER COMMUNITY AN EXTREMELY LONG SENTENCES HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO RUN COUNTER TO THAT OBJECTIVE AND ONLY FURTHER DEPRIVES HUMAN BEINGS WITH DIGNITY. NOT TO MENTION HOW WASTEFUL IT IS OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. RATHER THAN INVESTING ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN. THAT'S OUR ONE HUNDRED TWELVE SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS A YEAR SO THAT'S OVER ONE TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE A HUMAN BEING. WAS ALREADY SERVE THEIR STATUTORY OFFENSE RESOURCES CAN BE DIVERTED FOR REENTRY RESISTANCE. REENTRY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SERVICES TO HELP PROMOTE REHABILITATION. BETTER YET IF WE INVEST IN PEOPLE AND BASIC QUALITY OF LIFE WHERE WE ARE PROVIDING HOUSING FOOD CLEAN WATER HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION TO EVERY PERSON IN SOCIETY. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT WE WOULD SEE A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN ALL TYPES OF CRIMES. IT'S OFFICIAL RACISM IS SOMETHING THAT WE MUST ACTIVELY DISMANTLE TOGETHER ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME. AND THAT'S IS WHAT THE ANTI RACISM SENTENCING REFORM THIS BILL AIMS TO DO. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED TODAY BY TWO INCREDIBLE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LEAH LEAH GILLIS ATTORNEY AT LEGAL SLAW AND LETITIA ADWORDS PROGRAM DIRECTOR RESTORED JUSTICE. AND YOU CAN BEGIN UP WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WE'LL START WITH LEAH LEAH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH AND I'M SPEAKING AND TRONG REPORT OF A BEACON LONG. I THINK PERSONAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO HARD PAKISTAN BROKE DOWN MARKING AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE COURT ROOM ANNEX THIRTEEN AND THE IMPACT OF EXTREME SENTENCING AB. FIFTEEN OR NINE WEEKS TO ADDRESS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT EXPLANATION OF WHY AB FIFTEEN OH NINE WOULD NEED MORE. IN FACT I HAVE WITNESSED FIRST HAND WHAT THIS DOES THE YOUNG MEN OF COLOR WHO ARE MOST OFTEN THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE EXTREME EXAMPLES. MY CLIENT OFTEN PLAYED UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON WHEN ALL OF THE ENCAMPMENTS ARE ADDED UP. LIFT THE MORAL I FOUND THEY LOSE HOPE AND THEY END UP TAKING CREDO FOR WELL OVER FORTY YEARS. NINE FOR A OR SERIOUS INJURY HAS NOT OCCURRED. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS WHAT AB FIFTEEN OH NINE THAT AND DOES NOT NEED TO. THERE ARE WELL OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENCAMPMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. AB FIFTEEN HONORING TO OBJECT A SMALL HANDFUL OF BOTH ADVANCEMENT. THIRTY EIGHT TESTIMONY DURING THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE SHARING. PROSECUTORS CHARGE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE FRIENDS THEY CAN'T AS THE PRIMARY CHARGE. THEM A FAX ALL BEING THAT ARE FACTUALLY SUPPORTED. THEY THEN USE THE FACT THE ENHANCEMENT AS A COERCIVE FORCE. TO OBTAIN PLEASE HI TERMINATE BENSON SAYS. FORTY FIVE YEARS THAT TRYING TO AVOID THE EVEN SHOCKINGLY HIGHER INDETERMINATE SENTENCING. NOT A CLIENT WILL GET A FULL LEAD THAT TRIAL. THE REGULAR USE OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION EVISCERATES A COVETED CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS RIGHT AT THE JURY TRIAL. A RIGHT THAT IS FOUNDATION OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE REALITY IS OVER 90% OF THOSE CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL OFFENSES DO NOT INVOKE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE. FIFTY OUT DUE TO THE RATIONAL FEAR OF DYING IN PRISON BEFORE THEY EVER GET A CHANCE TO EVEN BE A PAROLE BOARD. WHERE A CLIENT BASE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS ALIVE. THE SIMPLY CANNOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO EVEN BE A SINGLE PAROLE HEARING. AB FIFTEEN OH NINE WOULD NOT REMOVE JUDICIAL OR PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION.

YES THIS IS SURE TO EVEREST SPORTS BONTA MMHM YOU CANNOT DO IT IN YOUR TOTAL. FOR SO CAN RESPOND TO THIS ONE- TALK ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENHANCEMENTS. EFFECTIVELY DOING WHAT BECAUSE I THINK MAYBE MY EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT IS DIFFERENT THAN YOURS I WANT YOU WHAT YOURS IS. SO TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT AB FIFTEEN OH NINE IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT EXCESSIVE AND RACES SENTENCING AND OVER INCARCERATION IN OUR SOCIETY. IT IS NOT. A GUN CONTROL MEASURE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW IF WE WAITED TILL THE SENTENCING TO A PERSON IS CONVICTED WE SLAP ON SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO PROACTIVE PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. GUN SAFETY IS GUN CONTROL UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS MAKING SURE DANGEROUS WEAPONS ARE ON THE STREETS THAT'S PREVENTATIVE THIS IS AN EXCESSIVE RESPONSE AND I JUST WANT ALSO MAKE SURE TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE DOES COMMIT A CRIME THEY STILL SERVE THEIR STATUTORY SENTENCE THEY STILL SERVICE. GUN ENHANCEMENTS ARE AN ADULT ADD ON THAT CAN SOMETIMES MAGNIFIED A CLUB MAGNIFIED THERE- SUCH AS FOR MUCH MORE SO I THINK LIKE I SAID IF WE- IF THESE WERE. EFFECTIVE MEASURES PREVENTING GUN CRIME THEN WE WOULD SEE THAT WE SEE THE RESULTS IN A REALITY THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND YET WERE NOT WORN OUT WHERE THESE THINGS. ARE IT ALSO OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID IN MY OPENING EVERY YEAR OF INCARCERATION. LEADS AT LEAST CHANCE OF RECIDIVISM SO BY ANY METRIC I DON'T THINK WE'RE SUCCEEDING AND- WASTING. UPWARDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER PERSON JUST TO KEEP SOMEONE OVERLY INCARCERATED SO I WOULD SAY BY FISCAL METRICS BUYER SEVEN METRICS ABOUT GUN SAFETY METRICS IT'S NOT WORKING. SO I WOULD SAY BY MY METRIC WHICH IS WE KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PERPETRATE CRIMES LIKE THIS SOME PEOPLE SEPARATE FROM THE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT ARE JUST DO MINE IN THEIR OWN BUSINESS WHEN THEY GET A GUN STUCK IN THEIR FACE- HI I THINK IT IS EFFECTIVE. AND I THINK ONE PERSON HAS A CHOICE AND THAT'S THE PERSON THAT DOES THE GUN STICKING IN THERE FOR STICKING IT IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S FACE THEY HAVE A CHOICE TO THINK ABOUT. WHETHER THEY FEEL LIKE DOING. THE EX TIME. FOR USING THAT GUN. AND TERRIFYING SOME VICTIMS AND THE VICTIM DOES NOT HAVE A CHOICE THEY JUST SIT THERE BE VICTIMIZED AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE WAY OUR DIFFERENCE IN PHILOSOPHIES IS THAT I AM ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE VICTIMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PROTECTED HERE AND YEAH I DO WANT TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HELP THEMSELVES. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE THE SENTENCING NICK ENHANCEMENTS AND DO IT ANYWAY AND TERRORIZE SOMEBODY BY STICKING A GUN IN THE FACE AND BY THE WAY DOESN'T FEEL VERY GOOD- I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR YOU YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WE GOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS DOING ITS HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE FOR THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T DO THE CRIME BECAUSE THEY DID THINK ABOUT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE GO ON GOING UP UP THE RIVER. FOR TWENTY MORE YEARS. FOR USING A GUN. WE HAVE THOSE STATISTICS BECAUSE WE DON'T DO STUDIES ON THIS. AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT. AND BEFORE ANYTHING I THINK ABOUT THE VICTIMS. AND THAT'S WHY I'M TIMES CAN'T BE SUPPORTING- LEGISLATION LIKE. THANK YOU. WICKS THANK THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR- I ONE THING THE OTHER BRING THE BILL FOR IT IT'S A THORNY ISSUE FOR SURE AS AS NOTED BY I THINK THE BOTH OF PRO AND CON FOLKS WHO ARE WEIGHING IN ACROSS THE STATE- I TOTALLY AGREE SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS DON'T WORK TO DETER CRIME I TOTALLY AGREE WE HAVE YOU KNOW MAJOR RACIAL INEQUITIES WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. RACISM EMBEDDED WITHIN OUR CREDIT PROMOTE JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT ONE THING I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER AND I WOULD BE. MORE THAN IT IS YESTERDAY SUPPORTER IS COULD BECOME THE- WAS THE SAVINGS THAT YOU GET FROM THIS. THAT YOU PUT INTO OUR CALVET CALIFORNIA WANTS AN INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT WERE. ALWAYS TRYING TO GET MONEY FOR EVERY SINGLE YEAR- YOU KNOW I CARRY THE BUDGET ASK ON THAT I'M ALWAYS. LOVING THE GOVERNOR LOVING SPEAKER LOBBYING SENATE PRO TEM THE BAR BUDGET CHAIRS TO INCREASE THAT MONEY. THAT SUPPORTS PROGRAMS. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE FROM THESE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DOING VERY EFFECTIVE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION WORK AND IT'S STOPPING VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS. AND IT NEEDS AN ONGOING FUNDING STREAM. SO I WOULD JUST STRONGLY URGE YOU TO- TO CONSIDER THAT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN. PURSUING THAT PATH. THANK YOU MR BURKE. MOVE THE BILL. THANK MISBACH GALA. THANK YOU- MR LEAVE FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND TELL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL THIS IS A HARD ONE AND YOU KNOW I AM A LONGSTANDING SUPPORTER OF GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION I THINK TO YOUR POINT ALL OF THE DATA SHOWS US THAT LONG SENTENCES DON'T PREVENT CRIME BUT IT'S NOT MAKING US SAFER AND IT'S JUST LEADING TO OVER INCARCERATION. AND SO I THINK TO MISS WEEKES IS POINT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE PREVENT THIS CRIME IN REALLY MEANINGFUL WAYS AND NOT JUST. IN PERSUADING PEOPLE FOR DECADES- TIER POINTS INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL SERVE THEIR UNDERLYING SENTENCE NO MATTER WHAT THE CRIME WAS THAT WAS COMMITTED. HE ALSO RETAIN SOME ENHANCEMENTS IN THIS BILL- AND I THINK THAT THAT PROSPECTIVELY IS. REALLY- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ADAM YOU KNOW LISTENING TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS ABOUT. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO SIT IN A ROOM WITH THE DEFENDANT AND TELL THEM. THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO TRIAL BECAUSE THE SENTENCE IS GOING TO BE TOO INSANE IF THEY DO AND THE RISK ISN'T WORTH IT I'VE DONE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S SAYING AND I THINK THAT. THAT'S REALLY WE NEED TO UNDER. EACH KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. AT THE SAME TIME HAVING. BEEN IN THOSE ROOMS I ALSO KNOW HOW PLEA DEALS ARE MADE. AND SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE IS CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE DEALS WERE MADE. AND WE ARE GOING BACK ON THOSE DEALS IN WAYS THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MADE PROBABLY. IN DIFFERENT WAYS HAD THIS BEEN IN PLACE AT THE TIME. AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU AND I DISCUSSED IT AND I WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. COMFORTABLE IT IF THERE WAS SOME JUDICIAL DISCRETION OR SOME. REVIEW OF THE RETROACTIVE PIECE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE SERVING A JUST SENTENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT. A THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY- AND THAT YOU KNOW IT IS TIME TO LET THEM OUT AND SO. I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THEIR ATTRACTIVE THE PEACE. YES CERTAINLY AND I THANK YOU SO EVER CANNED FOR BRING THIS- THIS ISSUE TO MY ATTENTION AND- AS WE'VE HAD SEVERAL BACK AND FORTH TODAY I'M REALLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG JUDICIAL DISCRETION. OF OUR PROCESS IN MIND. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ULTIMATELY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE AS WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A SITUATION THAT PLAYS OUT THAT. LEAD TO HAVING SOMEONE HAVE THEIR JUSTICE DEPEND ON THE COUNTY RECEIVED A CONVICTION AND- MIGHT MY SPONSORS AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WORKING WITH YOU. AND OTHERS ARE INTERESTED. TO FIGURE OUT DETAILS OF A JUDICIAL DISCRETION METHOD WITH A STRONG PRESUMPTION. THAT HOPEFULLY FAVORS THE FIRST THREE SENSING AS WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS NEW. NEW SYSTEM. SO IT'LL BE DIFFERENT I PROMISE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG ENGAGEMENT ON THIS I MEAN JUST THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WERE YOU. I'M TAKING OUT SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS CRIMES I THINK SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO REALLY MEET THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE ARE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON IT ALL SUPPORTED TODAY SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IF I MAY I'LL SHARE SOMETHING. OR THIS IS A SCORE MISQUOTED YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OKAY OKAY IF I IF I COULD I PERSONAL ON ALSO READ AN EXCERPT FROM A LETTER I GOT FROM INCARCERATED VIGIL AN EXCERPT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. I WAS THE FIRST YOU KNOW JUST WANT TO THANK THE MANY MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE CALLED IN SUPPORT AND ALSO WRITTEN SO MANY LETTERS AND ALSO TO OVER THE PHONE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY INCARCERATE INDIVIDUALS OF WRITTEN SUPPORT- ONE OF THEM. HAS ARE INTO ME PERSONALLY AS WELL AND I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THE LETTER OF COURSE THE TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS BEFORE I READ. THAT LETTER I JUST WANNA SAY YOU KNOW. THIS BILL IS A SAID HAS HIS ULTIMATELY ABOUT EXCESSIVE RACES RACES SENTENCING TO PERPETUATE INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT. AND SOMETHING THAT I FIND QUITE DISTURBING IS WHEN FOLKS OUTSIDE OF MY COMMUNITY COME INTO IT AND THEY'VE PREY ON THE FEARS AND ANXIETIES OF THE SE ASIAN AMERICANS DURING THESE TIMES AND HAVING THAT KIND OF. A TOUGH ON CRIME RHETORIC AND THAT IDEA HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY SOLD TO OUR COMMUNITY SINCE THE DAY WE ARRIVE IN THE SHORE IS A DIVISIVE IS THE BASE OF A SPECIALIZED COMMITTEES A CALLER AND I THINK IT'S QUITE FITTING THAT I AS SOMEONE BORN IN THE NINETIES IS TRYING TO UNDO THE HARM DONE IN THE NINETIES- TO PROBABLY DO THAT. BUT I JUST WANT TO READ A QUICK EXCERPT FIVE IF I MAY ABOUT A LETTER THAT I GOT I PERSONALLY FACILITIES INCARCERATED JUST REITERATE THAT THESE ARE REAL HUMAN BEINGS WITH LIVES THAT ARE BEING LOST REAL POTENTIAL THAT. THAT THAT IS NOT BEING REALIZED- THIS FIRST WRITES ME THAT I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF MY CRIME MY WAY OF THINKING WAS DISTORTED I WAS YOUNG AND I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER. I REGRET MY INVOLVEMENT AND SINCE SEVEN PARTICIPATING A POSITIVE GROUP GROUPS EDUCATION ENGAGING ANY AND ALL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AS AN ADOLESCENT IN THE PRISON PRISON SYSTEM I DEVELOP AN ATTITUDE OF I DON'T CARE WHO DO I HAVE TO LOSE. AS TOUGH AS TIME PASSED EXPERIENCE GROWTH THAT CHANGED MY MENTALITY AND OLD WAYS OF THINKING I TIME TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF MY TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SENTENCE THE NEW MIND SET A CLEAR VISION I WILL CONTINUE TO BETTER MYSELF I PLAN. ON UTILIZING MY EXPERIENCE TO BECOME AN AD IT TO HELP LEAD A- AWAY FROM FALLING VICTIM THE STREETS EVENTUALLY THE SYSTEM I WANT TO GIVE BACK TO MY COMMUNITY AND FIND WAYS ASSIST THOSE TRANSITION BACK INTO SOCIETY I DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE TO PROVE WORTHY OF MY DREAM AT A NEW LIFE OUTSIDE OF THESE CONCRETE WALLS AND I WAS A LETTER SENT PERSONALLY TO ME. I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED THAT GOT TO BE AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO- THANK YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE ROBUST CONVERSATION TODAY IN YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND IT WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOUR NEEDS THE CONCERNS ARE MET AND AGAIN ONE EIGHT A RATE THAT YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EVEN WITH OPPOSITION OF HOW WE MAKE IT WORKABLE. AND I JUST WANNA- GEORGE I'VE UP TODAY THANK YOU AND- HE CHURCH RECOMMEND I PUT I ALSO AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY GOES I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA IDEA DATA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS BROUGHT UP. IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT SINCE TO SIT ON BUDGET AND HOW MUCH SUPPLY I WOULD MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY TO GET MORE MONEY FOR VICTIMS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO HANDLE SO. BUT MAN I VOTE. CABALLERO THE BILL'S. MOVED INTO. AB KNOWN BISA A MEMBER OF THE MOST. IS DUE. TO THE APPROPRIATE. COMMITTEE JOHNSON- ACTIONS I AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NOW BARKING AND- BARKING AND I A CORK. CORK I SAN DIEGO. CA ARE TO. KNOW THEIR TEN NO WICKS. LEE HI B. I. YES I REMEMBER JONES SAWYER EUROPE WOULD THEY BE EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU- MEMBERS AND CHAIRS AND I WAS TOO LATE I AM HERE TODAY TO REJECT AB EIGHTY NINE TO PEACE OFFICER EDUCATION IN H. CONDITIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT ACT. FOR THE PEACE ACT RELY ON A DECADES THE DATA THE PEACE AFTER INCREASE THE CURRENT MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ALL PEACE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA FROM EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA TWO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD OR HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. RIGHT SIZE SHOWS THAT INCREASING THE AGE REQUIREMENT TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WILL ALLOW FOR FULL BRAIN MATURATION FOR THE PORTIONS WERE BOUGHT AFFECTING JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL WHEN OFFICES ARE PUT INTENSE SITUATIONS WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. FURTHERMORE STUDIES SHOW THAT A FOR YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES OFFICERS PROPENSITY TO COMMIT EXCESSIVE FORCE INCIDENTS WHEN OFFICERS WITH NO MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. MAKE UP SOME COLLEGE IS NOT ENOUGH IMPROVING OFFICER ENTRY REQUIREMENTS WILL ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY ESPECIALLY FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF COLOR WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY FALL VICTIM TO OFFICES SAYS OF COURSE. TWO WEEKS AGO I PULLED THE PIECE THAT FROM THIS COMMITTEE. SO THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION. AND THAT WAS THE DATA BACK AND NOT MERELY A SUMPTER. SINCE THEN I'VE HAD MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHERE MY OFFICE SHARED RESEARCH SHOWING INCREASED HIGHER EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS DO NOT HAMPERED RECRUITMENT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN FACT WHEN WE RAISE THOSE STANDARDS AND ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO WE HIRE WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE RECRUITS OF COLOR AS WE MOVE THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD I AIM TO STAY TRUE TO THE DATA. WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND IN FACT. WE'VE HAD MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH SEVERAL. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SOME OF WHICH YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO NOT ONLY LOOKING AT THE BILLS FROM THE- FOURTEEN OF BILLS FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND MAYBE BRING INTO THIS POLICY BUT MOVING FORWARD WITH SOME. WITH SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HOW WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD THE PEACE ACT WILL NOT. WOULD NOT ONLY PROFESSIONAL ICE POLICING BUT WILL ALSO CHANGE THE DEPARTMENT CULTURE AWAY FROM EXCESSIVE FORCE CONSISTENT WITH A BETTER EDUCATED MORE MATURE FOR FOURTH. WISH ME TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL IS DR HOPEFULLY SHE STILL THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS A GOOD A BIBLE STUDY AT SEVEN. SO I'M SHUT UP TO WE GET AROUND- RESEARCHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY FULLERTON AND ESTEBAN NO YES DIRECTOR ADVOCATES INCOME OR- FROM THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION CO SPONSOR. OF THE PEACE ACT. OKAY OPERATOR DO WE HAVE THAT ECHO ON THE LINE. IF THAT DOCTOR GARDNER I'M ON THE LINE YES WE WENT BACK TO GUARD OKAY YEAH GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME AND- MANY MEMBERS I STRONGLY SUPPORT RAISING THE MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PEOPLE. HE HOWEVER I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT EIGHTY EIGHTY NINE IS CURRENTLY READING COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON HIRING THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN LOW RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. IT SHOULD BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE A PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING RECRUITMENT AND HIRING SUPPORT FOR AGENCIES ESPECIALLY IN LOW RESOURCE AGENCIES AND IT SHOULD PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR STUDENTS INTO THE PROFESSION THAT INCLUDES SUPPORTS TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. WE THINK OF THE INVOLVED IT'S TIME THAT OUR MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS RESPECT THE INCREASED COMPLEXITY OF THE PROFESSION AND OUR EXPECTATION THAT OFFICERS THE MASTER PROBLEM SOLVERS NOT SIMPLY REPORT WRITERS. YOUR EVIDENCE THAT IT DEGREE PROMOTE POLICE. LEGITIMATE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RAISING THE MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL SHOULD HELP YOU COLLIDE THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT WE HAVE COLLEGE EDUCATED OFFICERS WORKING IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY. NOT JUST OUR HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA AGENCIES CURRENTLY REPORT THEY'RE HAVING A REAL DIFFICULT TIME HIRING YOU APPLICANTS THE NUMEROUS OPEN POSITIONS AND MANY APPLICANTS DO NOT MEET MINIMUM HIRING STANDARDS. IT WOULD BE A TRAGIC CONSEQUENCE IF THIS LEGISLATION FORCED AGENCES TO CHOOSE A COLLEGE GRADUATE WITH QUESTIONABLE MORALS OVER A NON COLLEGE GRADUATE WITH IMPECCABLE CHARACTER. THIS IS A REAL POSSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN LOW PAYING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO IN LARGE AGENCIES WITH MANY VACANCIES. WHICH NUMBER THAT RAISING MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENT WILL NECESSARILY REDUCE HIRING OF MINORITY AND FEMALE CANDIDATES. WHILE SOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO COLLEGE AS WELL AS LOW RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES IN COLLEGE AND THAT DOES ADD A NEW BARRIER TO ENTRY PEOPLE BY TALK FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE. AND IMPOVERISHED RECRUIT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO RESULT IN YOUR POLICE OFFICERS. FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. MY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT AGENCY WITH HIGHER EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND QUITE DIVERSE WORKFORCES. RAISING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS SHOULD NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT MINORITY RECRUITMENT AGENCY WITH ORIGINAL POLICY REQUIRING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE TO BE HIRED HAVE BETTER MINORITY REPRESENTATION THAT AGENCIES THAT REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PRACTICE. BUT SOMETHING LACK BY READING POLICY. ALSO THE PERCENT OF MINORITY OFFICERS IN AN AGENCY IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO COMMUNITY FACTORS SUCH A POP POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS HOWEVER THE PERCENT OF COLLEGE EDUCATED OFFICERS IN THE DEPARTMENT IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY EACH OF THE FACTORS. SUCH AS MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AGENCY FIVE AGENCIES HI HI THAT SORT OF THING. AND WOMEN ARE GENERALLY MORE EDUCATED THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS SO IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY A CHANGING MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. PORTS FOR STUDENTS BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL TO ENSURE POTENTIAL OPPOSITION EVERY COMMUNITY CAN BECOME POLICE OFFICERS. I HAVE IDEAS ON HOW TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION DEGREE PROGRAM THAT I'M HAPPY TO THE GAPS FOR ANYBODY WHO'S INTERESTED. WE COULD FOR EXAMPLE MODELED ON A BSN DEGREE PROGRAM OR ON CAL STATE SACRAMENTO LAW ENFORCEMENT CANDIDATES CALLERS PROGRAM. THAT HELPS PREPARE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FOR PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTS AND POLICE ACADEMY. SO IN CLOSING THIS BILL CAN HELP YOU FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATED OFFICERS EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT COULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO IMPROVING POLICE PERFORMANCE OF LEGITIMACY. THROUGHOUT THE STREET AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FOCUS OF A BEATING ON EIGHTY EIGHTY NINE. I'M REQUIRING A BACHELOR'S DEGREES. FOR WORK AT THE PUMP CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICER BUT WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM. SPEAKING AMENDMENTS. THE BELL I'M FEEL SHARED. WE CAN I ALSO. APERTURE FUTURE. AND ACCESS TO I'M GLAD FROM COLLEGE FOR THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ESTEBAN LEARN YES. I YES SIR- BY CHURCH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NOT SPONTANEOUS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING WHAT THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION I'M ALSO KNOWN AS A R. C. A. R. T. MEMBERS NOW WHAT VERY WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING- PEACE OFFICERS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WORK IN CORRECTIONS WHO HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO MAKE OBJECTIVE DECISIONS IN HIGH STRESSFUL AND HIGH STAKES SITUATIONS. WILL NOT CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE AND HAVE POLICIES THAT REFLECT BRAIN SCIENCE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH GOVERNS THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF REASONING ADVANCED POT AND IMPULSE CONTROL IS NOT FULLY. DEVELOPED UNTIL THE MID TWENTIES. THIS IS SHOULD BE REFLECT IN THE THAT GUIDE OUR LOGS OFFICERS. HAVING INDIVIDUALS WHOSE BRAINS HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED OR WHO HAVE THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND TO DEVELOP A DEEPENED UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO CRIMINALITY SUCH AS TRAUMA. IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF UNLAWFUL OR IMPULSIVE USE OF COURSE AND INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF REHABILITATION FOR THOSE INCARCERATED. AS MANY OF YOU KNOWN FORMALLY INCARCERATED I SPENT SIX YEARS IN PRISON FOR. A TRAGIC IMMATURE DECISIONS THAT I MADE IN MY YOUTH. DURING MY TIME INCARCERATED I WORKED HARD- TO WORK THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE ME TO MAKE THE MATURE DECISION BUT I DID. IN DOING SO I THOUGHT SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM MY FAMILY. HERE'S ANYTHING CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. IT WAS IN MY EXPERIENCE. THAT THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO ADDED SHE A DEGREE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT WOULD TREAT ME AND I WAS INCARCERATEDAROUND ME WITH HUMAN DECENCY. WHICH ULTIMATELY PROVIDED ME THE HOPE AND COURAGE TO WORK THROUGH MY TRAUMAS. I ALSO FOUND THOSE WITH NO HIGHER EDUCATION WOULD DEMEAN AND BELITTLE US WITH NO REGARD FOR REHABILITATION OR SUPPORT. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY BUT ALSO IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO HELP THOSE TO THE REHABILITATIVE PROCESS. WE NEED PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS TO UNDERSTAND. THAT HURT PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE. AND WE NEED PEOPLE CAN REACT. WELCOME FROM A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. IT IS FOR THE REASONS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSE. THANK YOU.

IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. AT BNL ANYBODY ON COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS BILL. YES MISTER COURT- TRY MISTER FELDMAN DIDN'T SPEAK BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WHILE I DON'T LIKE THE CURRENT BILL I WILL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU AN AYE VOTE BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I EXPECT THE BILL COULD BE MUCH BETTER WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR. I HAS BEEN MOVED YET. YEAH IT'S BEEN MOVED GOOD THANK YOU CHECK IN THIS COURT. THANK YOU. MR CHARTER GO AHEAD SIR. SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ILLS IN THE IN POLICING. MY CONCERN IS THE REALITY OF RECRUITMENT TODAY IS THAT THE POLICING PROFESSION IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS DESIRABLE- WE DID PULL ONE STATE AGENCY. AND RIGHT NOW THEY THEY HAD LIKE THERE ARE DOWN 50% IN IN THEIR RECRUITMENT- AND THE APPLICANTS THAT THEY GET. AND THAT 50% IS LIKE TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE STILL. BUT OUT OF THAT TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ONCE THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THERE'S ONLY LIKE FIVE HUNDRED APPLICANTS THAT THEY GET THROUGH TO THE PART WHERE THEY GO TO THE ACADEMY. AND THEN THERE'S A DWINDLING DOWN FROM THERE. AND SO GIVEN THOSE LIMITED RESOURCES AND ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW YEAH I KNOW THE BRAIN SCIENCE IS THAT THEY THEY'RE NOT MATURE UNTIL THE TWENTY FIVE SPECIALLY MALES- BUT- I ALSO YOU KNOW LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE- KIDS ARE GOING TO THE MILITARY RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND FOUR YEARS LATER THEY GET OUT AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CAREER. AND THOSE CAREERS- THAT ARE OPEN TO THEM A LOT OF THEM ARE ATTRACTED TO THE POLICING AND BEING ABLE TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR I KNOW IN OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND- IN THE AREA WE HAVE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF VERY YOUNG OFFICERS AND THEY'RE AWESOME AND THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT THE RIGHT WAY- I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING OUT THERE AND. SOME OF THESE LARGER AGENCIES ESPECIALLY. AND I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE IT. AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE LEAVING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OUT OF A CAREER A POTENTIAL CAREER FOR THEM BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL MAKE. A DECISION WHERE THEY WANNA GO LONG BEFORE THEY HIT TWENTY FIVE. YES SOME OF THEM JUST DON'T WANT TO BE AT MOM AND DAD'S HOUSE UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY SIX. AND AND SO I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET STARTED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THAT JUST KIND OF SHRINKS THAT POOL EVEN MORE- SO I GUESS I JUST HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE APPROACH IS GOING TO WORK- I'M SURE IT'LL GO THROUGH HERE AND- AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. BUT AND ALSO THE LAST THING. I CAN THINK OF A LOT. OF NOT MISTER PROFESSIONS. BUT ENDEAVOR IS THAT PEOPLE ARE IN. DEBT AND THEY COULD USE THAT THAT HIGHER DEGREE. AND I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY REALLY HIGHER DEGREES. AND STILL MAKE BONE HEAD MOVES SO I DON'T THINK IT EDUCATION IS THE IS NECESSARY THE ANSWER TO- CAN MAKING AT WHAT WORK WHAT'S WHAT AILS OUR SOCIETY GO AWAY. I THINK IT'S A COMPONENT OF IT BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE INVOLVED IN IT SO. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER SERRA TO. WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGH IN ON THIS THIS ISSUE AND I'LL TRY TO BE JUST REALLY DIRECTING SHORT. I THINK. AS A PERSON WHO SPENT THE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MY LIFE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR. IS THE HEART OF A PUBLIC SERVANT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES A GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOT CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE- IN MY OPINION LIFE EXPERIENCE HELPS DEMONSTRATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THAT HEART. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AND I COMMEND YOU FOR. TRYING TO APPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S GENERALLY WHERE YOUR HEART IS. BUT I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE. WITH THIS PARTICULAR PATH- I THINK EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS ARE HELPFUL I HAPPEN TO BE TWENTY SIX AND WAS A COLLEGE GRADUATE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MADE ME. THE PERSON IT WAS EFFECTIVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW WHAT. IT WAS THAT I TRULY DO HAVE A SERVANT'S HEART AND A VERY VERY- I FOUND IT AND THAT'S WHY PROMOTED AS BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A FIELD SUPERVISOR. TO ENSURE THOSE WHO ARE ENCOUNTERING THE PUBLIC. DID SO. IN THE WAY THAT OF THE PUBLIC DEMANDS AND SO. I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE BUT HOPEFULLY WE COME TO A PLACE. THAT WE BOTH AGREE THAT WILL IMPROVE. AND MAYBE HELP IDENTIFY THAT SERVICE MARK IS THAT I THINK THAT'S THE REAL QUALIFIER. SO DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY I GUESS WE HAVE A- I GUESS YOU GET A CHANCE TO CLOSE MAN GLAD. AND I APPRECIATE BOTH MISTER SAOTOME MISTER LACKEY'S COMMENTS BECAUSE I NEED YOUR COMMENTS TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER JUST JUST SAY THAT- I WISH I COULD. I HAVE A WHOLE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT RESEMBLE MR LACKEY- I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MORE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO I JUST NEED TO HAVE AND HAVE A GOOD HEART. AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB THAT'S WHERE I'M GETTING TO- THAT'S WHY I TOOK OFFENSE WHEN PEOPLE CAME TO ME TO SAY THAT I'M GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS- WE HAVE A SAYING IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THAT NOT ALL SKIN FOLK ARE YOUR KINFOLK RECEIVING THOSE SOMEBODY MAYBE AFRICAN AMERICAN THEY MAY BE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE POLICE OFFICERS. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE BEST PERSON NO MATTER WHAT THE COLOR RED THIS AND SELL OUT I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED EVEN. I KIND OF I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THERE ARE WORK REASON WORKING TO POLICE CHIEFS MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MANAGE THIS. YEAH AT THE END OF THE DAY. THEY'RE GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHORTAGES. THEIR NUMBERS FIVE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKE THE HEAT FOR- ABOUT POLICE BEATINGS AND ALL THE- WRONG THINGS THE BAD APPLES AS WELL AS THEY GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN KEEP. THE GOOD APPLES IN IN THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY RECRUIT THE MEN THERE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO AS MUCH TRAINING AND THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM. AND AND EVEN LOOKING AT. ON GOING. DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY THERE IN GIVING THEM- THE SOME KIND OF EDUCATION- LOOK WHEN YOU CAME IN. WHAT DOES THE CHP IT'S GOT TO BE TWENTY ONE. SO MAYBE EIGHTEEN ISN'T THE NUMBER. MAYBE TWENTY FIVE NOT THE NUMBER. BUT BETWEEN THE C. H. P. AT TWENTY ONE L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF IS TWENTY ONE. AND PROBATION OFFICERS. THE AGES TWENTY ONE FOR A REASON. AND SO IT MAY NOT BE TWENTY FIVE MAY NOT BE EIGHTEEN IT MIGHT BE TWENTY THREE BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF NEGOTIATION THAT WAS TELLING MR QUIRK WE'RE LOOKING AT- MAYBE WE START EARLIER MAYBE PROVIDE INCENTIVES. THAT IF YOU GO THROUGH A- TWO YEAR PROGRAM. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MAY WE GIVE INCENTIVES TO PAY FOR YOU TO GO TO UC OR CAL STATE. AND WE MAYBE GET RID THAT DAY HOPEFULLY MISTER SEA OTTER THAT DRIVES PEOPLE TO WANT THAT'S LIKE A HUGE INCENTIVE. THAT THEY COME IN WE SHOULD HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND FINALLY- JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THE- OUR- EXPERT- SHE EVEN BROUGHT UP THINGS THAT WE DID EVEN THINK ABOUT. LIKE IT MAY BE EXEMPTING. SMALLER POLICE DEPARTMENTS FROM THIS. OP BECAUSE- THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK. HAS PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE OR LESS DISMISSED THIS MAY BE A BURDEN ON IT MAYBE WE NEED TO. I TO GIVE SOME KIND OF SUPPLEMENT ARE WE IT. MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD WHAT I'M PROPOSING. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WESTONE MISTER CORK WILL GET EVERYTHING EVER TALKING DIRECTLY TO. PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE THIS BILL. AND SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK WORKS BEST. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR **** BOOK I VOTE KNOWING THAT. I'M NOT CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THE RIGHT WAY. THANK YOU READY. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON EIGHTY EIGHTY NINE BY THREE MEMBER JONES SAWYER THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER IRAQI NOT YET NOPE BLACKIE NOW BARRICK HE HAND BACKHAND ON A QUIRK. WORK I SANTIAGO. DID HE- C. R. TERM NOW THERE TURNOUT WICKS LI LI I THAT MEASURE SOME QUALITY. WE ONE MORE. THAT I CALL MY. RIGHT. WE'RE SANTIAGO LAST YEAR'S OF BILLS THAT MAKE. HE'S VERY ELUSIVE THAT MAN. AND ACTIVISTS. MR QUIRK WILL WILL BEGIN SANTIAGO NUMBER NINETEEN SANTIAGO A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN- AND THIS OBVIOUSLY IF MR HE WILL. INITIATIVE STAB STATUTES BY PROHIBITING THE PRIOR JUVENILE JUVENILE EDUCATION FROM BEING CONSIDERED A PRIOR SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONY CONVICTIONS FOR PURPOSES OF SENTENCING CAMP ENHANCEMENTS IN OTHER WORDS. YOU DON'T ALLOW SOMEONE WHO IS A JUVENILE. AND FOR THAT STRIKE TO COUNT TOWARDS THREE STRIKES BILL WOULD JOB PROVIDING MEANS OF VACATING THE PRIOR JUVENILE CONVICTION ENHANCEMENT. AND RESENTENCING A DEFENDANT ON ANY REMAINING COUNTS WHEN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS APPLY. LOOTING WITH THE ALLEGED PRIOR CONVICTION OCCURRED WHEN THE DEFENDANT WAS JUVENILE THE CASE WAS EDUCATED IN JUVENILE COURT. I REQUIREMENTS ARE DISSIPATION OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS IN THE RESENTENCING PROCESS- WELL IT DOES THAT. AND THE- I YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A RECORD RECORD NIGHT SIX HOURS. I'VE I'VE SAID ENOUGH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW JUVENILES WHO HAVE A STRIKE TO HAVE IT COUNT TOWARDS THREE STRIKES THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE SALE. THIS MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES. I'M SURE THEY WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY RIGHT NOW YES THEY CAN SAY MORE THAN I WOULD- TOM STATEMENT NO DAN PHILOSOPHICAL LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE- IT SAYS M. MIGUEL A. GARCIA AND TO RECIDIVISM COALITION. IDEA SAID VIDEO TESTIMONY. YEAH LET'S GO FOUR WEEKS WE HAVEN'T USED THIS THING. DAN MIGUEL JUST PUSH START TALKING DISS EXCITING STUFF. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAN FILLS OUT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. HOW TO SPONSOR AB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENED HERE- GO AHEAD. AS MR COURT EXPLAINED AB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF JUVENILE- STRIKE EDUCATIONS TO ENHANCE A SUBSEQUENT ADULT FELONY THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THE FACT THAT JUVENILES IN THE JUVENILE COURT DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL JURY TRIALS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TWO USE EIGHT JUVENILE ADJUDICATION TO ENHANCE OF THE DAHLE FELONY IS BOTH BAD. LAW AND BAD POLICY THE PURPOSE OF JUVENILE COURT IS REHABILITATION. AND IT'S IN NO OTHER AREA OF LAW CAN A NON CRIMINAL. PROCEEDING BE USED TO ENHANCE IT CRIMINAL SENTENCE JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT COP CONSIDERED CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN JUVENILE PROCEEDING UP UNDER THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND IS NOT TO BE DEEMED A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND AGENT ALL A JUDY CATION ISN'T NOT DEEMED TO BE AT A CRIMINAL CONVICTION YET UNDER OUR THREE STRIKES ALL THAT JUVENILE ADJUDICATION CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE. A SUBSEQUENT ADULT FELONY. THIS HAS BAD- IMPACTS ON OBVIOUSLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO FACE A JUVENILE STRIKE THE G. EDUCATION THAN OTHER RACES THIS IN TURN LEADS TO. A LONGER INCARCERATION CARED FOR A SUBSEQUENT ADULT CONVICTION THAT MEDICAL SCIENCE SHOWS THE JUVENILE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS NOT THE SAME AS ADULTS JUVENILES MAKE RECKLESS. DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR IMMATURITY AB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN RECOGNIZES THIS AND WOULD SOLVED EIGHTY- A DISPARITY IN THE LAW IT WOULD HAVE CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION ON REFORMING JUVENILE JUSTICE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PHILLIPS OUT OF THIS YEAR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ESKOM FLIGHT BY PRECIADO. THE NEW YORK. GOOD EVENING AUDIBLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN MY NAME IS MIGUEL GARCIA AND THE ADVOCACY COORDINATOR WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION AS A TEEN I WAS CHARGED WITH PREMEDITATED MURDER AND WAS SENTENCED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE. JUSTICE AND I RECEIVED A JUVENILE STRIKE. UPON MY. UPON MY ARRIVAL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE I RECEIVED AND USE ALL THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ME TO REHABILITATE MYSELF ON MY DESTROYED FROM DJJ I HAVE EARNED THREE ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND ONE BACHELOR DEGREE FROM UC RIVERSIDE I SAID ON NUMEROUS YOUTH JUSTICE EXECUTIVE BOARDS AND I DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME STAY OUT OF THE- JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I RECEIVED AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND THAT SAME YEAR THE COURT ORDER MY CASE DISMISSED. AND STILL HOWEVER I NOW CARRY THAT SAME JUVENILE STRIKE. LONG AFTER MY COOK MY OBLIGATIONS TO THE STATE AND MY COMMUNITY. AND IF I WERE TO COMMIT ANOTHER HARM I WOULD LIKELY RECEIVE AN ENHANCED SENTENCE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MANY GET THE COLOR GOOGLE HOME FROM DJJ AND YEARS LATER COMMITTED. A HARM THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVED AN ENHANCED SENTENCE WITH LITTLE TO NO HOPE OF REHABILITATION. THE REALITY IS JUVENILE STRIKES ARE OVER PUNITIVE. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ELIMINATE JUVENILE STRIKES YOU CREATE IT MORE. JUSTICE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOCUSED ON% REHABILITATION AND NOT INCARCERATIONS. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT EIGHTY ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU.

THANK YOU COOPER NOW BRING AN END TO THE COMMITTEE SO THAT MR SANTIAGO FINANCE ANSWER. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. BUYS THE BRIEF SO I'LL ANSWER BRIEF. SO ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS THIS YOU KNOW I UNIPOL IDEAS. SO SAID THE OUT OF IT. IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR FROM THE YOUNG YES THE YOUNG MAN WHO TESTIFIED. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM THERE YOU HAVE MILITATED HIMSELF. AND I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME. BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S GOT JUST TWO MORE. BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BECAUSE HE DID WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO TO CORRECT WHATEVER WAS WRONG IN HIS LIFE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. DOES THIS EIGHT HI I'M NOT SURE THAT. THERE'S A CORRELATION FROM WEAKENING THE THREE STRIKES LAW BECAUSE THEY'RE A JUVENILE TO SOMEHOW- KEEP PEOPLE WHO ARE RITUAL WHO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES FROM STAYING OUT OF PRISON. WHAT DID YOU DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING IT'S LIKE IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WHEN THEY GET OUT AND IF THERE ARE TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY EIGHT. AND THEY DECIDE TO DO AN ARMED ROBBERY. WELL I WE WILL CONNECT ONE OF THE THREE OF THEM BEFORE WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THAT BOY THIS IS YOU KNOW. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'VE DONE BEFORE AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO IT. I'D HATE TO BE THAT THE THIRD FELONY IF THEY GET THE DING DONG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COMMIT CRIMES ARE DONE DOING THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF- THE THREE STRIKES LAW OR THE RUNNING THE RED LIGHT CAMERA LAW OR ANY OF THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO RUN THE RED LIGHT OR GOING TO COMMIT MORE FELONIES. AND I DON'T THINK TAKING AWAY THAT IS GOING TO- MAKE IT BETTER I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO. I REHABILITATE THEM- THEY'VE ALREADY PROVEN THAT THEY PROBABLY CAN'T BE. WHAT WHAT LOXO. ANYWAY THAT'S JUST NOT JUST JUST COMMON I HAVE ON. THE CARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT BILLS LIKE THAT THANKS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER CORK- HASN'T HAS BEEN MOVED HAS NOT BEEN MOVEMENT TO CRY WILL MOVE IT THAT IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SUPPORT BILLS LIKE THIS TO SAY. IT'S GETTING LATE. THIS THANK YOU ARE ANY MORE COMMENTS- YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER SURE KNOWING THAT IT'S GETTING LAID OFF KEEP- BRIEF AND THANK- MY COLLEAGUES- FOR PRESENTING AND THANK- DA GAS CONE HAS SPONSOR AND OTHERS- FOR A CHAMPION AND A BILL LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE- THE JUVENILE- TRIED BETWEEN FOR JUDICATA BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN- WHAT HAVE THAT SAME ACT COUNT AS A THIRD STRIKE BUT IF THEY DID THREE OF THOSE AT AT BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IT WOULDN'T COUNT. AND THE JUVENILE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW SUPPOSED TO BE REHABILITATED- BY NATURE- IN THAT IN THAT WE'RE NOT COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES HERE BECAUSE WHEN AN ADULT AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE- IS TRYING TO COURT- THE TRIBECA JURY OF THEIR PEERS AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME- SORT OF SCENARIO THAT YOU WOULD SEE OFFER JUVENILE WITH ARE NOT TRIED NUMBER ONE- THEY'RE THEY'RE JUDICATA IT. EITHER NOT CONVICTED- IT'S A WHOLE SET OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND CERTAINLY WE CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE MERITS OF WHY Y. IDEOLOGICALLY- I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT BUT JUST ON THE MERITS OF PURE FACT AND PROCESSES IT JUST ABSOLUTELY MAKES NO SENSE- THAT YOU WOULD. USE I KNOW JUDICATA ED AN ACTION THAT WAS ADJUDICATED IN YOUR USE AS A CONVICTION WHEN YOU WERE TRIED BY A JURY OF YOUR PEERS- AS AN ADULT- IN AND WE DO THIS KIND OF WORK BECAUSE IT'S HARD IN BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OUR SOULS AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING. TO DO NOT THE CAN CAN YOU TO. MASS SO HAVING SAID- TO BRIEF I CAN SAY- SOME THAT CAN SAY ON SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY. ABOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR ADULT.
