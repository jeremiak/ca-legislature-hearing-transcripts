GOVERNMENT AND TAX REVENUES AS A

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.968 region:rollup2
RESULT OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:57.236 region:rollup2
AS WE KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.737 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHICH ARE MY FAVORITE

00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.005 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:02.107 region:rollup2
TO THE BRIDGES PROGRAM WHICH

00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:03.842 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR INTERNSHIPS FOR

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:07.446 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:08.046 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND WE HAVE HAD ONE

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:09.348 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINE OF

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.848 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS COME THROUGH THAT

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:11.516 region:rollup2
PROGRAM MANY OF WHOM ARE

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:12.851 region:rollup2
DIVERSE.

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.753 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHOM COULD NOT AFFORD TO

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:15.988 region:rollup2
STAY IN SCHOOL BUT FOR THE

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.289 region:rollup2
MINIMAL STIPEND THAT WE HAD

00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:19.057 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THEM.

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:21.159 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO WORK IN STEM CELL

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:22.160 region:rollup2
LABS FOR THE SUMMER.

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:23.562 region:rollup2
THAT WE OFFER THEM THAT'S

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.364 region:rollup2
STIPEND ALSO OFFER THEM AN

00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:27.299 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AND MANY OF THEM

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:28.900 region:rollup2
HAVE MOVED ON TO OTHER ACADEMIC

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:29.601 region:rollup2
ENDEAVORS AS A RESULT OF THEIR

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.969 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.437 region:rollup2
AND HE'S LAPS AND THEN WE ALSO

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:34.006 region:rollup2
STARTED IT WHICH I HELPED START

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:35.474 region:rollup2
THE SPARK PROGRAM.

00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:37.142 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS HERE TOO PINPOINTING

00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:38.577 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITHIN

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:39.845 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:42.981 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO PAY THEM A VERY

00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:43.515 region:rollup2
SMALL INTERNSHIP AND SO FAR FIVE

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.816 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FORTY HIGH SCHOOL

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.918 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.587 region:rollup2
THIS EXPERIENCE AND YOU WOULD BE

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:50.255 region:rollup2
INSPIRED IN THRALL TO HEAR THESE

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:52.124 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.525 region:rollup2
TALK LIKE PHD CANDIDATES IN

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:55.160 region:rollup2
PRESENTING THEIR WORK THEY DID

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:56.695 region:rollup2
OVER THE SUMMER AS WE JUST HEARD

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.163 region:rollup2
A FEW WEEKS AGO OR LAST WEEK

00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:59.831 region:rollup2
RATHER UC DAVIS.

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:01.767 region:rollup2
THESE ARE OUR FUTURE STEM CELLS

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.235 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS WHICH WE HAVE TO

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:05.203 region:rollup2
NURTURE AND WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE

00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:06.705 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:08.840 region:rollup2
A WE ALSO AND SENT YOU A VIDEO

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:10.375 region:rollup2
THAT EACH MEMBER WILL RECEIVE OF

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
TWO OF OUR SPINAL CORD INJURY

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:13.545 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN WHAT'S CALLED THE

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.447 region:rollup2
SCARIEST BIO THERAPEUTICS

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:16.915 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIALS.

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:20.252 region:rollup2
CHRIS BOATSWAIN FOR BAKERSFIELD.

00:30:19.618 --> 00:30:21.453 region:rollup2
I YOU WILL DEFINITELY INSPIRED

00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:22.421 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT JAKE IS NOW CAL

00:30:21.453 --> 00:30:23.955 region:rollup2
POLLY.

00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:26.591 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY SO BISPO STUDY

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:27.059 region:rollup2
BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND DID

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.493 region:rollup2
RELEASE FOR ME ON HIS

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.661 region:rollup2
WHEELCHAIR.

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:31.363 region:rollup2
WHICH HE COULD NEVER DO THAT

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:32.731 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER THE INJURY AND CHRIS

00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:34.266 region:rollup2
WAS THE FIRST PATIENT TREATED

00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:35.067 region:rollup2
WITH TEN MILLION CELLS STEM

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:36.001 region:rollup2
CELLS.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:38.403 region:rollup2
AND HAS EXPERIENCED THE MOST

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:40.806 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT VIDEO HE COULD NOW

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.940 region:rollup2
LIFT WEIGHTS AND HE COULD NOW BE

00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE MOBILE THAN HE WAS

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.976 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AFTER THE

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.144 region:rollup2
ACCIDENT.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:48.246 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S SO

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:49.948 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET A SENSE

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:52.584 region:rollup2
OF WHERE WHERE WERE MOVING

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:53.585 region:rollup2

REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:22.140 region:rollup2
AT CERTAINLY NEVER FORET THAT

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:23.408 region:rollup2
WE WERE THIS AGENCY WAS FORMED

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.176 region:rollup2
BY THE BY THE PASSAGE OF

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:26.044 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION.

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:27.546 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE BY THE

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:29.414 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:30.715 region:rollup2
IN OUR MISSION REMAINS TO

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:32.317 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE STEM CELL AND

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:33.018 region:rollup2
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE TO

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:36.721 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WITH UNMET MEDICAL

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:38.957 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:39.457 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRESS

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.392 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE MADE TODAY IT

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.427 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES?

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:43.929 region:rollup2
QUITE AMAZING TO THINK THAT THE

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:45.530 region:rollup2
HUMAN STEM CELL WAS FIRST

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:47.466 region:rollup2
ISOLATED ONLY TWENTY YEARS AGO

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.999 region:rollup2
IN.

00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:50.135 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THIS

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:51.636 region:rollup2
OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW FIELD.

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:52.838 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STEM CELL HAD THE

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.539 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED CAPACITY TO

00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:56.274 region:rollup2
PROLIFERATE AND TO GIVE RISE TO

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:57.342 region:rollup2
EVERY CELL IN THE BODY.

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.877 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY CAPTURED THE HUMAN

00:32:57.342 --> 00:33:01.213 region:rollup2
IMAGINATION AND PROMINENT

00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:02.647 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS IN THE FIELD PROPOSED

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:04.483 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COULD ELUCIDATE.

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:07.486 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS AND HELP US SOLVE THE

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:10.722 region:rollup2
TOUGHEST MEDICAL DISEASES THAT

00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:12.791 region:rollup2
THAT ARM ARE ARE DEVASTATING OUR

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:15.460 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND ADULTS.

00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:16.094 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.896 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND THERE ARE

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:18.697 region:rollup2
VERY FEW STEM CELL SCIENTISTS

00:33:17.896 --> 00:33:22.367 region:rollup2
ARE VERY FEW.

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:23.335 region:rollup2
WHO COULD AFFORD TO PURSUE THIS

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.836 region:rollup2
LINE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE THERE'S

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:26.004 region:rollup2
SO IT JUST WAS NOT NOT ENOUGH

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.705 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THIS AND IT WAS SUCH

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.773 region:rollup2
A NEW FIELD?

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:30.475 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE VISION OF THE

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:32.077 region:rollup2
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA PATIENT

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:33.678 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES RESEARCHERS AND OTHER

00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:35.514 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:37.048 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE WAS

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:38.383 region:rollup2
FORMED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:40.252 region:rollup2
AS YOU SAID BY THE PASSAGE OF

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:41.119 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION.

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:43.121 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE AND SINCE THEN

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:44.623 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE LEADER

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:46.024 region:rollup2
IN THE FIELD AND REMAINS AT THE

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:47.559 region:rollup2
HELM AT THE FOREFRONT.

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.894 region:rollup2
OF WHAT'S NOW CONSIDERED OF

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:51.830 region:rollup2
MEDICAL REVOLUTION CALLED

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:53.431 region:rollup2
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.

PARTNER WITH THE BEST ACADEMIC

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:02.307 region:rollup2
AND INDUSTRY PROJECTS TO FAST

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:04.042 region:rollup2
TRACK THEM TO GET INTO

00:34:02.307 --> 00:34:05.911 region:rollup2
THERAPEUTICS BY GOING THROUGH

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:07.779 region:rollup2
THE STAGES OF ARE BEING TESTED

SINGLE GENE MUTATIONS FOR WHICH

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:08.279 region:rollup2
SUCH AN APPROACH COULD ALSO BE

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:10.148 region:rollup2
USED. TO CORRECT THEM.

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:11.015 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND EXAMPLE I WANTED

00:39:10.148 --> 00:39:12.350 region:rollup2
TO HIGHLIGHT A DIFFERENT

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.650 region:rollup2
THERAPEUTIC APPROACH

[inaudible]

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:17.555 region:rollup2
WHICH COMBINES.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:19.591 region:rollup2
SURGICAL ADVANCES WITH.

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:20.992 region:rollup2
STEM CELLS GENE THERAPY.

00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:23.628 region:rollup2
WE FIND A DOCTOR TO BE MACKENZIE

00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:25.363 region:rollup2
AT UCSF SHE'S A PEDIATRIC

00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:27.765 region:rollup2
SURGEON AND A RESEARCHER.

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:30.134 region:rollup2
WHO'S A DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE

00:39:27.765 --> 00:39:31.769 region:rollup2
TREAT BABIES WHO HAVE ALFA

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:33.938 region:rollup2
THALASSEMIA WHICH IS A FATAL

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:35.406 region:rollup2
BLOOD CONDITION.

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:37.575 region:rollup2
OFTEN THESE BABIES DON'T MAKE IT

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:39.677 region:rollup2
TO FULL TERM THEY'RE LOST IN

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:41.412 region:rollup2
EURO AND I A MISCARRIAGE.

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:42.947 region:rollup2
SHE TREATS THE SPEED OF SAYS

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:43.248 region:rollup2
WHILE STILL ON THE MOTHER'S WOMB

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:45.049 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:46.885 region:rollup2

MATERNAL STEM CELL TRANSPLANT

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:50.121 region:rollup2
THE BABIES BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:51.422 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MUSE SYSTEM TO ACCEPT

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:52.857 region:rollup2
THE MOTHER STEM CELLS.

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:55.126 region:rollup2
CAN ACCEPT THE STEM CELLS AND

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:56.527 region:rollup2
GIVE RISE TO NORMAL BLOOD CELLS.

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:58.196 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS TO BRING THE BABIES

00:39:56.527 --> 00:40:00.665 region:rollup2
TO FULL TERM.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:02.433 region:rollup2
AND THE ULTIMATE.

00:40:00.665 --> 00:40:04.235 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM BE FULLY

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:05.937 region:rollup2
CURED BUT SHOULD THEY REQUIRE

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:07.438 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT AFTER BIRTH NOW

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:08.273 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TOLERANCE TO THE MOTHER

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.674 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THEY GET THE TRANSPLANT

00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:10.842 region:rollup2
IF THEY NEEDED EVERY DOES AFTER

00:40:09.674 --> 00:40:11.376 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT.

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:12.810 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.778 region:rollup2
CELLS.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.047 region:rollup2
THIS STORY ALONG WITH THE

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:16.948 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF A VERY PINK AND CUTE

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:18.516 region:rollup2
THREE WE CALLED WHO WAS THE

00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:19.584 region:rollup2
FIRST PATIENT ENROLLED IN THIS

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:21.386 region:rollup2
TRIAL WAS FEATURED.

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:23.254 region:rollup2
AND ON IN THE MAY TWENTY FIFTH

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:25.023 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES.

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:27.859 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT CHILD IS STILL ON

00:40:25.023 --> 00:40:31.095 region:rollup2
GOING BUT IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:32.597 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD --

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.065 region:rollup2
THE EXCITEMENT AROUND

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:35.800 region:rollup2
IMMUNOTHERAPY AND CARTY

00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:37.835 region:rollup2
THERAPIES.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.870 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU KNOW TWO OF THE FIRST

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
IN KIND.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.473 region:rollup2
ON PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.808 region:rollup2
BY THE FDA JUSTICE PAST YEAR FOR

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:46.077 region:rollup2
THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA AND

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:46.577 region:rollup2
LYMPHOMA.

00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:49.180 region:rollup2
WHILE ALL THIS WAS IN

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:52.116 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT STURM SCIENTISTS HAD

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.718 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN WORKING ON A WAY TO

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:55.286 region:rollup2
OUR CREATE STEM CELL ARE IMMUNE

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:57.622 region:rollup2
CELLS.

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:59.624 region:rollup2
USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE A

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:01.726 region:rollup2
DURABLE AFFECT A LOT AGAINST THE

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.794 region:rollup2
TOUGHEST SOLID CANCERS SUCH OF

00:41:01.726 --> 00:41:04.429 region:rollup2
THE BRAIN CANCER.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:07.632 region:rollup2
GLIOBLASTOMA.

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:08.966 region:rollup2
AND CERTAIN LUNG CANCERS.

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:11.502 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM AT CITY OF HOPE AT

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2
CITY OF HOPE.

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:14.772 region:rollup2
HIS TARGETING GLIOBLASTOMA A

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.674 region:rollup2
DATE DEADLY BRAIN CANCER AND

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:17.842 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:19.277 region:rollup2
IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:20.411 region:rollup2
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE FOR IT.

00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:22.547 region:rollup2
SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS AN

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:23.948 region:rollup2
INITIAL PATIENTS.

00:41:22.547 --> 00:41:25.683 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT IS THOSE ALSO

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:27.518 region:rollup2
NOTABLE BECAUSE IT'S OUR SOURCE

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:29.487 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRST ROYALTY CHECK DUE

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:31.723 region:rollup2
TO A PARTNERSHIP OF THIS PROGRAM

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:33.391 region:rollup2
WITH A COMMERCIAL ENTITY.

00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
THAT WAS TO BAN THAT WHENCE I

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:34.125 region:rollup2
HAVE --

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:38.896 region:rollup2
AWARDED TO THE STATE IN

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:39.530 region:rollup2
DECEMBER.

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:41.466 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I CAN GO

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:43.201 region:rollup2
ON AND ON ABOUT EVERY SINGLE

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:45.203 region:rollup2
PROJECT THAT WE HAVE IS

00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:47.005 region:rollup2
SPECTACULAR AND AND JUST A

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:48.606 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO WHAT THEY HAVE

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:50.408 region:rollup2
BEEN CONSIDERED SCIENCE FICTION.

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:52.810 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:54.445 region:rollup2
SAMPLING FOR SOME OF THE DAY ON

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.180 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE.

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:57.648 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OTHER TYPES OF SELF

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.483 region:rollup2
THERAPY AND JEAN PROGRAMS ARE

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:02.286 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

00:41:58.483 --> 00:42:02.587 region:rollup2
THE MOST TOUGH INDICATION

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.589 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:09.127 region:rollup2
DISEASE STROKE AND NEUROLOGIC

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:10.862 region:rollup2
DISEASE AS SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:12.463 region:rollup2
WE'RE QUITE ENCOURAGED THAT

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.965 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S SO MUCH.

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:16.401 region:rollup2
PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THESE NEW

00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:17.468 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.237 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL MORE TO

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:20.405 region:rollup2
DO.

00:42:19.237 --> 00:42:22.540 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ONLY WITH THESE

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:24.709 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES BUT IN THE NEXT

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.011 region:rollup2
WAVE OF INNOVATION [inaudible]

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.513 region:rollup2
SO.

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:30.748 region:rollup2
JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND DOCTOR

00:42:28.513 --> 00:42:32.450 region:rollup2
SHINYA YAMANAKA WHO'S ONE OF

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:34.285 region:rollup2
THAT STORM FUNDED --

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.187 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS AT THE GLADSTONE

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:39.257 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE AT UCSF HAD RECEIVED

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:40.525 region:rollup2
THE NOBEL PRIZE IN. TWO THOUSAND

00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:42.527 region:rollup2
TWELVE FOR HIS DISCOVERY THAT

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:44.695 region:rollup2
ADULT STEM CELLS.

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:46.297 region:rollup2
OUR OWN SKIN CELLS OR BLOOD

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:49.834 region:rollup2
DRAWS CELLS OBTAINED FROM BLOOD

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:52.070 region:rollup2
DRAWS CAN BE REPROGRAMMED.

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:54.272 region:rollup2
BY RESETTING THE JEANS TO BECOME

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.506 region:rollup2
STEM CELL LIKE.

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:57.475 region:rollup2
SO THAT THOSE CELLS THAT YOU

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:59.010 region:rollup2
REPROGRAM FROM CELLS COMING FROM

00:42:57.475 --> 00:43:00.711 region:rollup2
AS A SKIN BIOPSY.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.680 region:rollup2
CAN DOWN POTENTIALLY GIVE YOU AN

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:04.782 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF THESE

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.150 region:rollup2
PLURIPOTENCY MEANING CAN BE

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.451 region:rollup2
TURNED INTO OTHER CELLS

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.653 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:10.655 region:rollup2
SO THIS.

00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:13.291 region:rollup2
PROSPECT OF HAVING READILY

00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:15.059 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE CELLS THAT CAN BE USED

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:16.594 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY AT

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:18.262 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES I JUST DESCRIBED.

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.831 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.732 region:rollup2
AS A QUITE.

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:24.435 region:rollup2
EXCITING ITS STILL IN ITS EARLY

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:26.838 region:rollup2
FANS WE STILL DON'T HAVE A TRIAL

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:29.340 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. FOR I PSC ARM

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:30.842 region:rollup2
DERIVED CELLS THERAPEUTICS.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.343 region:rollup2
DOCTOR YAMANAKA AS WELL AS OTHER

00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:34.512 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS ARE CONTINUING TO DO

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:36.447 region:rollup2
THE WORK TO OPTIMIZE CONDITIONS

00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:38.616 region:rollup2
TO THESE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:41.018 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED SAFELY IN PATIENTS.

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:42.420 region:rollup2
IT IS A TANGIBLE AND UNFOUNDED

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:44.088 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THESE POOR UPON STEM

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.624 region:rollup2
CELLS COULD GIVE RISE TO THE

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:49.060 region:rollup2
NEXT WAVE OF THERAPIES.

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:50.128 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IN JAPAN ON THERE

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.964 region:rollup2
ARE READY EARLY TRIALS LOOKING

00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:55.166 region:rollup2
AT I PSC THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:56.200 region:rollup2
NERVE CELLS THAT EXPRESSED

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.435 region:rollup2
DOPAMINE WHICH IS MISSING AND

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.803 region:rollup2
PARKINSON'S.

00:43:57.435 --> 00:44:01.405 region:rollup2
AS AN APPROACH TO PARKINSON'S

00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:02.740 region:rollup2
DISEASE.

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:04.742 region:rollup2
THIS TECHNIQUE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.677 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THE AYE

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:07.979 region:rollup2
PSE TECHNOLOGY AWARD HIGHER THE

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:09.347 region:rollup2
TYPE OF EARLY INVESTMENT.

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:11.983 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE IN TRANSLATIONAL

00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:14.318 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS

00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:16.387 region:rollup2
BUT SERMONS PUT INTO PLACE.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:18.289 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH JUST

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:19.857 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT [inaudible]

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:21.859 region:rollup2
HOUSE TERMS.

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:24.061 region:rollup2
PROCESSES AND VALUE PROPOSITION

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:26.230 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND BY

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.531 region:rollup2
OTHERS OUTSIDE OF SPERM

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.232 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:29.800 region:rollup2
IN INDUSTRY.

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:31.936 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST INDUSTRY IN

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.704 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL INVESTORS HAVE BEEN

00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:35.740 region:rollup2
AND ARE NOT VERY ENTHUSIASTIC

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:38.676 region:rollup2
ABOUT COMING IN EARLY SIMPLY

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.477 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SCIENCE WAS. TO TWO

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.012 region:rollup2
YOUNG --

00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:42.713 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TOO MANY UNKNOWNS AND

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.982 region:rollup2
IT WAS A FINANCIAL RISK.

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:47.251 region:rollup2
SO SIR ARM PLAYED THE ROLE OF

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:50.855 region:rollup2
QUOTE UNQUOTE DE RISKING MEANING

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:52.356 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THE BEST SCIENCE --

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:54.091 region:rollup2
FUNDED THE INVESTIGATORS TO

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:55.092 region:rollup2
PURSUE IT SO THAT THEY CAN GET

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:57.028 region:rollup2
TO A STAGE WHERE THEY CAN TEST

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:59.263 region:rollup2
IT AND A PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:00.565 region:rollup2
USING THIS MODEL.

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:02.133 region:rollup2
WERE VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:04.068 region:rollup2
THIS HAS.

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:05.236 region:rollup2
ATTRACTED INDUSTRY INVESTORS AND

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:08.239 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS COMMERCIALIZATION

00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:08.806 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS FOR PROGRAMS AND

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:11.943 region:rollup2
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:14.211 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:45:11.943 --> 00:45:16.180 region:rollup2
A PROJECT THAT WE US SUPPORTED

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:17.548 region:rollup2
AT STANFORD IN ITS EARLY DAYS

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.584 region:rollup2
WHILE STILL ON THE BENCH.

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:21.252 region:rollup2
WAS BASED ON A CONCEPT THAT

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:22.320 region:rollup2
THEIR CANCER STEM CELLS SO KIND

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:23.688 region:rollup2
OF THE EVIL TWIN OF THE OTHER

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.356 region:rollup2
STEM CELLS.

00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:27.992 region:rollup2
AND WE FUNDED THIS WHEN THE

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:30.094 region:rollup2
CONCEPT WAS STILL DEBATED IN THE

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:31.429 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:32.530 region:rollup2
TODAY IT'S NO LONGER DEBATED

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.599 region:rollup2
IT'S ACCEPTED THAT THERE ARE

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.933 region:rollup2
CANCERS STEM CELLS THAT THEY ARE

00:45:34.599 --> 00:45:38.536 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO TARGET IF YOU'RE

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:40.304 region:rollup2
GONNA TRULY YOUR THESE CANCERS.

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:42.974 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:44.508 region:rollup2
WAS THAT LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:46.577 region:rollup2
HAD JUST GONE PUBLIC RECENTLY

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:48.112 region:rollup2
AFTER RAISING A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.180 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING.

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.949 region:rollup2
SO IT MADE IT ALL THE WAY FROM

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.818 region:rollup2
THE BENCH TO THE BEDSIDE TO A

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:55.286 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIP.

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:56.587 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE EXAMPLES

00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.755 region:rollup2
OF HOUSE ARMED DOLLARS HAVE BEEN

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.590 region:rollup2
LEVERAGED TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL

00:45:57.755 --> 00:46:01.192 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.893 region:rollup2
JUST A BED OVER HALF OF THE HALF

00:46:01.192 --> 00:46:05.229 region:rollup2
WAY MARK THIS YEAR ALONE.

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:06.130 region:rollup2
WE'VE RECORDED OVER FIVE HUNDRED

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:45.562 region:rollup2
FROM INDIA.

00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:47.064 region:rollup2
SHE WAS ALSO SHAKEN UP AND DOWN

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:50.100 region:rollup2
WE EVENTUALLY WE LANDED UP TO

00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:51.635 region:rollup2
UCSF AND WE FOUND.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT NOT MANY

00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:54.471 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS DAD HOW WE'VE BEEN

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:56.306 region:rollup2
OFFERED BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:58.041 region:rollup2
FROM ME TO HIM.

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.375 region:rollup2
NOW IT WAS THE FIRST AUDITION

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:01.044 region:rollup2
BUT THEN --

00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:03.013 region:rollup2
BLESSING IN DISGUISE HE WAS.

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:04.514 region:rollup2
FOUND AS ACTS LINK TO SKATE WITH

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:06.183 region:rollup2
FOR THE TESTING.

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.683 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHEN WE CAME TO KNOW

00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:09.820 region:rollup2
THAT --

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:11.221 region:rollup2
SADDAM IS [inaudible]

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:14.324 region:rollup2
TRY [inaudible]

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:15.592 region:rollup2
SKID AND AND AND LOOKS LIKE THAT

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:17.928 region:rollup2
IS THAT IS REALLY SUCCESSFUL

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:19.496 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE AND AND

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:20.764 region:rollup2
ALSO WE WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:22.399 region:rollup2
STARCH ON THE GENE THERAPY AND

00:58:20.764 --> 00:58:23.834 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT.

00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:25.035 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:28.005 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE THE FIX ON

00:58:25.035 --> 00:58:29.840 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW DNA AND THAT COULD

00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:31.675 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF FOR ANI WILL FIX THE

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.809 region:rollup2
THING BECAUSE OF WHICH HE'S DE

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:34.010 region:rollup2
SALES AND HIS BE SO THAT ARE

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.978 region:rollup2
GROWING UP.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.380 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE REALLY THINKING YOU

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:38.115 region:rollup2
KNOW SOMETHING WHICH CAN GO FROM

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.783 region:rollup2
ME TO HIM GOOD PRO PROBABLY

00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:40.884 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN HIM

00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:43.186 region:rollup2
BUT SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN FIX

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:44.521 region:rollup2
AND HAM AND WHEN IT'S GIVEN BACK

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.122 region:rollup2
TO HIM PROBABLY THAT WOULDN'T

00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:45.455 region:rollup2
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY KIND OF

00:58:45.122 --> 00:58:46.156 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS OUT.

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:47.691 region:rollup2
OF IT.

00:58:46.156 --> 00:58:49.226 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE

00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:49.860 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO HAD AND PLUS WE'RE

00:58:49.226 --> 00:58:50.927 region:rollup2
TALKING TO ALL THE DOCTORS OVER

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.929 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:54.097 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WE HEARD ABOUT THE

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:55.699 region:rollup2
GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:57.667 region:rollup2
SITUATION WITH THE BONE MARROW

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:58.835 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT WHICH WAS REALLY.

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:59.403 region:rollup2
TIGHTENING AND WE'VE AT HITTING

00:58:58.835 --> 00:59:01.037 region:rollup2
LOT OF INFECTIONS HAPPENING

00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:02.939 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT.

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:06.243 region:rollup2
SO GENE THERAPY WAS REALLY.

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:08.678 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO GO AND THANK YOU TO

00:59:06.243 --> 00:59:10.614 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SORRY MAN THANK YOU --

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED

00:59:10.614 --> 00:59:14.551 region:rollup2
TO ARTS THE UMP CLINICAL TRIALS

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.653 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE OF FINDING THE

00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:18.822 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THIS.

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:20.490 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW DEADLY DISEASE --

00:59:18.822 --> 00:59:21.992 region:rollup2
WE WE DID THE GENE THERAPY ON

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:24.594 region:rollup2
JUNE EIGHT TWO THOUSAND

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:26.797 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AND AND THAT WAS THAT

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:28.131 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY A BLESSING DAY FOR US

00:59:26.797 --> 00:59:29.166 region:rollup2
WE STARTED WE CAN PLACE THE

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:31.735 region:rollup2
CELLS TO GROW UP.

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:34.137 region:rollup2
AND BY BY SEPTEMBER FIFTH.

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:35.272 region:rollup2
HE HAD FUNCTIONAL.

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
MORE THAN 5% OF THE CELLS IN HIS

00:59:35.272 --> 00:59:38.708 region:rollup2
BODY.

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.110 region:rollup2
AND BY SEPTEMBER TALKING WEAVER

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:42.179 region:rollup2
SAID THAT YOU KNOW BY UCS OF

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:45.282 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN NOW LET CAN GO OUT.

00:59:42.179 --> 00:59:47.084 region:rollup2
PLAY AROUND ENJOYED THE BOY THEN

00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:47.751 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SEE AROUND SO SEPTEMBER

00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:50.287 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN WE GOT DISCHARGED FROM

00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.854 region:rollup2
UCSF AND HE HAS BEEN HE HAS BEEN

00:59:50.287 --> 00:59:52.255 region:rollup2
DOING GREAT HE'S VERY ACTIVE

00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:53.957 region:rollup2
CHILD.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.591 region:rollup2
HE IS BE CELLS OF ALSO COME UP

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:56.560 region:rollup2
NOW -- LIKE

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.661 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.197 region:rollup2
AND DEBBIE CELLS ARE GROWING

00:59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.831 region:rollup2
VERY FAST SO WE ARE PLANNING TO

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.099 region:rollup2
A STOP THE THAT THAT IS THAT IS

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.667 region:rollup2
--

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.001 region:rollup2
ANTIBODIES THAT WE GIVE HIM

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:06.736 region:rollup2
EVERY MONTH --

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:08.939 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HIS BECAUSE OF THAT OUR

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:10.140 region:rollup2
DEBT IT'S CALLED IVY ID.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2
AND DOCTORS UP RUNNING TO STOP

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.578 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL SO HE'S DIESEL THAT

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:15.178 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNCTIONAL USE DIESEL HAVE

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:16.880 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY GROWN UP LIKE A NOT

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.647 region:rollup2
MUCH I HE IS PLAYING AROUND HIS

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.248 region:rollup2
GOING AROUND HE HAS BEEN TO

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.783 region:rollup2
CROWDS HE HAS BEEN TO ALL THE

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:21.118 region:rollup2
MALLS.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.519 region:rollup2
USING FANTASTICALLY WELL USING

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.554 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.389 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THANK YOU TO SHOW HIM

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.757 region:rollup2
WHO HAS.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:29.593 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHO HAS BEEN AYE AYE

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:31.828 region:rollup2
AYE WAS THAT AND I'M IN ONE OF

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.696 region:rollup2
THE MEETINGS IN OAKLAND AND I

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.497 region:rollup2
SAW.

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:34.364 region:rollup2
THAT ALL THAT LEGAL TRIES WITH

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:36.533 region:rollup2
SON HAS BEEN.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:37.067 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND I'M I'M REALLY

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:38.969 region:rollup2
BLESSED AND WE ARE REALLY

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:40.003 region:rollup2
BLESSED TO IN A ACCORDING TO ONE

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.638 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CATEGORIES.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:43.840 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR FOR

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:46.276 region:rollup2
SHARING YOUR STORY AND YOUR BE

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.476 region:rollup2
YOUR BABY BOY IS A BEAUTIFUL

ALL THE BEST TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:58.255 region:rollup2
SO WE DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:01.992 region:rollup2
PERHAPS FOR THE FOR THE A PANEL

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:03.460 region:rollup2
--

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.995 region:rollup2
AND I'D WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.429 region:rollup2
FROM MY COLLEAGUES SINCE DOCTOR

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.063 region:rollup2
PARK SHOWED A FIRST WILL GIVE

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:09.266 region:rollup2
DOCTOR QUIRK THE FIRST QUESTION

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:12.502 region:rollup2
--

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:14.437 region:rollup2
SHOW FOR A DOCTOR MILIND PRETTY

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.638 region:rollup2
PREENCHER LESSENING THE LAN

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2
MILAN.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:18.909 region:rollup2
FARM.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:20.777 region:rollup2
BR QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:23.013 region:rollup2
CURRENT FEDERAL POLICY ON STEM

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:25.482 region:rollup2
CELL RESEARCH.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:27.284 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT INITIALLY --

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.151 region:rollup2
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAID

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.186 region:rollup2
ONLY CERTAIN CELL LINES HAD

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.320 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED COULD BE

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.255 region:rollup2
YEARS [inaudible]

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.657 region:rollup2
VAN.

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:35.125 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WAS AN

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:37.093 region:rollup2
EFFORT ON THAT ON THE OBAMA

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.862 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN IT UP

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.095 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DID.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.198 region:rollup2
LIKE --

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:44.868 region:rollup2
HAVING -- A

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:46.002 region:rollup2
CLEAR JUST --

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.504 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:50.540 region:rollup2
DONATED THEIR CELLS SOME OF

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:51.474 region:rollup2
THOSE LINES FAN COULDN'T BE USED

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.476 region:rollup2
IT CETERA SO WHAT IS THE CURRENT

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:54.978 region:rollup2
STATE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STATE OF

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:56.279 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.580 region:rollup2
IS THE FEDERAL RESEARCH

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:58.682 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.483 region:rollup2
ARE [inaudible]

01:01:58.682 --> 01:02:02.552 region:rollup2
HAVE ARTIFICIAL.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:04.888 region:rollup2
OF RESTRAINTS SUCH AS WE TALKED

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:07.457 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS IT BEING A FUNDED OUT

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.757 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:11.127 region:rollup2
SO -- SOME

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.128 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:14.297 region:rollup2
LIFTED --

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:16.499 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS EVEN

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.100 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THE NIH FOR INSTANCE

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.735 region:rollup2
IS STILL NOT FUNDING GENERALLY

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.270 region:rollup2
--

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:22.439 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT THE EMBRYONIC STEM

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:25.275 region:rollup2
CELL RESEARCH.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:27.410 region:rollup2
A STURM IS FINDING EMBRYONIC

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:30.180 region:rollup2
STEM CELL RESEARCH BUT ALSO.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:31.247 region:rollup2
7080% ARE THE NEW STEM CELL

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.249 region:rollup2
DISCOVERIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:36.119 region:rollup2
IN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:37.954 region:rollup2
HI MATIC GENE MODIFIED --

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:39.155 region:rollup2
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL THAT WE

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:41.424 region:rollup2
SPOKE UP --

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:44.227 region:rollup2
SO WHERE MORE DIVERSE AND THE

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:45.695 region:rollup2
TYPES OF STEM CELL --

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:47.497 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT WERE.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:51.267 region:rollup2
BEING SUPPORTED NATIONALLY.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.637 region:rollup2
THEN IN RONNIE'S CASE YOU ALSO

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
--

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:57.207 region:rollup2
RE USING GENETIC ENGINEERING.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:03:01.044 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:03:03.413 region:rollup2
WERE USING VIRUSES TO OKC USING

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:05.315 region:rollup2
IRISES IT WOULD HAVE ATLANTIC

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.916 region:rollup2
VIRAL --

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.817 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE WAS A VIRAL SO

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:09.386 region:rollup2
IT'S A VIRAL THAT BECOMES.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:11.655 region:rollup2
INCAPACITATED IN TERMS OF ITSELF

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:13.723 region:rollup2
BEING INFECTIOUS BUT IT JUST

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:15.258 region:rollup2
SERVES AS A VEHICLE TO DELIVER

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:17.060 region:rollup2
THE JEAN --

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:18.695 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T USES AN OPPORTUNITY

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.298 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT WE HAVE SOME UP

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:22.799 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WITHIN WITH AND THAT

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:24.401 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION JEAN EDITING

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2
CALLED CRISPER RIGHT WE'VE ALL

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:28.638 region:rollup2
HEARD OF FOR VARIOUS INDICATIONS

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.473 region:rollup2
AS WELL --

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.675 region:rollup2
SO.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.743 region:rollup2
THERE'S QUITE IT'S JUST MOVING

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:35.178 region:rollup2
AT LIGHTNING SPEED IN TERMS OF

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:37.314 region:rollup2
THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:39.316 region:rollup2
SPECIFICITY BY WHICH GENES CAN

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:41.918 region:rollup2
BE EDITED AND THAT --

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:44.821 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS SOME QUITE A BIT OF

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:46.523 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY AROUND OF GETTING THE

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.291 region:rollup2
BEST FACTORS MAKING THIS SO IT'S

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:49.626 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S PRACTICAL THAT

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.826 region:rollup2
CAN BE CREATED INTO A PRODUCT

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:52.162 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.663 region:rollup2
IS NOT SO CUMBERSOME THAT IT'S

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:55.398 region:rollup2
NOT PRACTICALLY ABLE TO GET OUT

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.533 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS SO THAT THOSE ARE

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:59.035 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE KIND OF THE

01:03:56.533 --> 01:04:00.470 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING ACTIVITIES BEHIND THE

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.538 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC AS WELL AS THE

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:04.841 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIAL.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:06.042 region:rollup2
ARE ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.678 region:rollup2
ACTIONS ON FLORA.

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:11.014 region:rollup2
STEM CELLS.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:13.216 region:rollup2
OTHER RESEARCH OF THAT TYPE.

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:15.251 region:rollup2
I'M GENE THERAPY RESEARCH WELL

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:17.387 region:rollup2
GENE THERAPY BUT JUST THE U.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:19.689 region:rollup2
SUPPLIER PLOWDEN STEM CELLS

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:21.491 region:rollup2
OPPOSED EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:23.426 region:rollup2
NOT NOT CURRENT IN TERMS OF THE

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:25.328 region:rollup2
INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:27.197 region:rollup2
NUMBER NO OF RESTRICTIONS ON

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:28.765 region:rollup2
THAT IS JUST THE SCIENCE THAT

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:30.333 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO MATURE.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:33.036 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I HAD MENTIONED KINDA

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:36.406 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY --

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:38.842 region:rollup2
WHAT UNIQUELY THIS STORM DOES

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:39.876 region:rollup2
PURSES WHAT THAT OTHER AGENCIES

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:41.644 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.346 region:rollup2
RESEARCH FROM?

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:45.849 region:rollup2
WHAT IT'S REALLY QUITE

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.750 region:rollup2
REMARKABLE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE?

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.385 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TYPE OF

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.986 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS BEEN FUND IT LOOKS

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.488 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S BEING FUNDED?

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:53.523 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:55.425 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.192 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY HAVE THE SCIENTIFIC

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:56.860 region:rollup2
DISCOVERY THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.328 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.230 region:rollup2
WE GET THIS SO IT DEVELOPED INTO

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:01.197 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE GET TOUGH IN A

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.499 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIAL NOTED THAT.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:04.234 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:05.935 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF PHASE CALLED THE

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:08.938 region:rollup2
TRANSLATIONAL PHASE.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:10.640 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE NIH ARM

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:12.575 region:rollup2
IS DON'T REALLY TRY TO FIGURE

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.943 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY IN

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.577 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:16.713 region:rollup2
IN THIS ARENA COUNTY THAT'S TERM

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.981 region:rollup2
--

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.315 region:rollup2
HAD THAT BIG WE BECAME

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:21.317 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST SENATE AND THE THE

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:23.286 region:rollup2
REASON THAT THEY ARE PARTNERING

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:24.087 region:rollup2
WITH US FOR THE CURE SICKLE CELL

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.488 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AND WERE IN

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.389 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.157 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF POTENTIAL

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.024 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:30.160 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE THEY

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:32.362 region:rollup2
REALIZE THAT WE JUST HAD IT WAS

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.030 region:rollup2
BUILT BY DESIGN FOR THESE TYPE

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.898 region:rollup2
OF TREATMENTS TO GET THEM OUT TO

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.666 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:38.368 region:rollup2
SO -- I

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:40.003 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT WOULD REGARDLESS

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:41.604 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND AND

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:44.073 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT WE HAVE IS

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:47.010 region:rollup2
A VERY RELIABLE SYSTEM.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:48.545 region:rollup2
AND VERY DE LA DEEP EXPERT

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:50.013 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY AS WELL AS WITH OUR

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:52.081 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC REVIEWERS AND

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:52.715 region:rollup2
ADVISERS --

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.951 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ADVISORS DEVELOPMENT

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:56.920 region:rollup2
--

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:58.388 region:rollup2
EXPERTS TO HELP US WITH ALL

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.988 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS OKAY WE'VE

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.991 region:rollup2
CONVINCED ME YOU HAVE A UNIQUE

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:04.594 region:rollup2
--

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:06.696 region:rollup2
SPOT IN THE I RESEARCH

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.897 region:rollup2
ENVELOPMENT AREA THANK YOU.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:09.899 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU DUCT WORK

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:12.235 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:14.204 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:15.538 region:rollup2
I'M JUST ALWAYS SO ENERGIZED

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.139 region:rollup2
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE NEW

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.842 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS OF SYSTEM CREDIBLE

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:20.543 region:rollup2
--

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:23.313 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:26.149 region:rollup2
WE HAD LEARNED IN THE PAST --

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:27.717 region:rollup2
WHEN I DID IT SEVERAL TOURS UMP

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.085 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT --

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:30.320 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ADDED.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THESE NEW.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.657 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT EITHER GENE THERAPY

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:35.859 region:rollup2
OR A MINHA THERAPY --

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:38.661 region:rollup2
WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES OF

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSES ARE A LOT OF TIMES

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:42.599 region:rollup2
WITH RARE DISEASE SOMETIMES IT

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.434 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE IN UP TO EIGHT YEARS

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:46.402 region:rollup2
BEFORE PEOPLE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:48.137 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:50.139 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PHYSICIAN IS NOT.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:52.208 region:rollup2
NO MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:53.610 region:rollup2
BEFORE OR YOU KNOW PATIENTS AND

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.144 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALL YOU KNOW THERE IN

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:56.446 region:rollup2
THE CLINIC ARE HOW DID THEY GET

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:59.315 region:rollup2
TO SOMEONE WHO CAN FINALLY

01:06:56.446 --> 01:07:00.617 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE --

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:02.852 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MOVED ALL TALKED ABOUT

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:05.054 region:rollup2
IN DOING THAT EARLY SCREENING.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:06.723 region:rollup2
WHEN A BABY IS BORN WHICH IS

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:08.224 region:rollup2
GREAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.659 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:11.661 region:rollup2
EVERY?

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:13.730 region:rollup2
NEWBORN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:15.832 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW HOW MANY OF THESE

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.299 region:rollup2
GENES CAN WE GET THAT EARLY

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:18.935 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS FOR AN EARLY

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:20.270 region:rollup2
SCREENING.

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:24.741 region:rollup2
ARE WITH THAT USE YOU KNOW FAR

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.843 region:rollup2
AS A GOAL.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:29.512 region:rollup2
I THINK IF YOU BRING UP A AND

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:32.148 region:rollup2
AND AND AND A VERY IMPORTANT --

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:34.017 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION AND AT IT AS A

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.517 region:rollup2
PEDIATRIC ORGAN TRANSPLANT

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.853 region:rollup2
SURGEON.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:38.955 region:rollup2
UP THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:41.691 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY APPRECIATED --

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:43.393 region:rollup2
THAT ABILITY TO PREDICT WHAT'S

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:45.495 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN AND AND IN THESE

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.863 region:rollup2
BABIES EVEN BEFORE THEY'RE BORN.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.631 region:rollup2
BUT IN SOME CASES AS YOU SAY

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:50.233 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT RECOGNIZE TO LATER AND

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.801 region:rollup2
THEN THERE IS ED THAN THAN THAT

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:54.971 region:rollup2
WORK UP OCCURS.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:56.873 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE IS --

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:59.242 region:rollup2
AND GREG ENDS WHOSE AT STANFORD

01:07:56.873 --> 01:08:00.310 region:rollup2
IS A IS A AS A GENETICIST AND

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:02.445 region:rollup2
THE METABOLIC EXPERT WAS ONE OF

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.913 region:rollup2
THEM THE KEY PLAYERS IN TERMS OF

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.547 region:rollup2
HELPING BRING FORWARD SOME OF

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.050 region:rollup2
THE THAT.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:08.451 region:rollup2
THE SCREENING SOUTH IT WAS FOR

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:10.520 region:rollup2
FUN ARE MINE. ONE OF THE KEY

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:12.922 region:rollup2
THINGS AND ADVANCEMENTS THAT

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.525 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN MADE IS THIS.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
A IDEA OF THE REASON WE'RE ABLE

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:18.828 region:rollup2
TO DO GENE THERAPY IS BECAUSE WE

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.563 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN GENOME --

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.864 region:rollup2
BETTER NOW.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.032 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN GENOME

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.634 region:rollup2
BETTER NOW BECAUSE IT WAS A

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:27.837 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:31.507 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IN THE NINETIES. TO

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:35.011 region:rollup2
MAP THE HUMAN GENOME.

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:37.780 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE GENES.

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:39.749 region:rollup2
AND CELLS IN THE BODY IS MADE

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.683 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE BY THE DISCOVERY THAT

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:40.984 region:rollup2
LED TO THE NOBEL PRIZE

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.919 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:45.254 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:46.856 region:rollup2
DON ON MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:48.424 region:rollup2
CELLS THAT THE FIRST TIME IT WAS

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:50.360 region:rollup2
NOTED THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.828 region:rollup2
MANIPULATE THE GENES AND COME UP

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.197 region:rollup2
WITH A DIFFERENT EFFECT.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:56.366 region:rollup2
THE MOST NOBEL PRIZE IN TWO

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:58.635 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN OR SO.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:59.736 region:rollup2
ALL EVERY EVERY SINGLE DISCOVERY

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:03.172 region:rollup2
ALL THESE ADVANCEMENTS ARE

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:04.974 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON EACH OTHER SO.

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:06.476 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GENETIC SCREENING IN

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:08.411 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:10.813 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON SARM FOR

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:12.248 region:rollup2
INSTANCE HAD FUNDED THAT OJ A

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:15.051 region:rollup2
GENOMICS PROGRAM TOGETHER.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:17.553 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFIC INDEPTH LOOK AT

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:20.123 region:rollup2
JUST TO THEM VERY VERY VERY --

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:22.225 region:rollup2
FINE DETAILS OF WHAT IS

01:09:20.123 --> 01:09:24.093 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE CELLS AND

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:25.795 region:rollup2
DISEASE STATES AS WELL AS AN AND

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:28.765 region:rollup2
HEALTHY STATE.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:31.367 region:rollup2
WE CREATED AND AND I SEM INDUCED

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:31.934 region:rollup2
PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL BANK WITH

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.469 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:35.171 region:rollup2
LINES THAT CAN BE USED. TO

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:38.107 region:rollup2
ELUCIDATE DISEASES SUCH AS

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:39.942 region:rollup2
AUTISM JUST REALLY REALLY --

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.677 region:rollup2
INDEPTH ANALYSIS TAKING

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:43.546 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF WHERE THE

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:44.514 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS WITH BIG DATA AND

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.149 region:rollup2
AND MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.016 region:rollup2
LEARNING TO THERE'S STILL MORE

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.018 region:rollup2
TO DO.

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:51.921 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:53.156 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT STEM SELLER SELF

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.924 region:rollup2
THERAPY IN ISOLATION.

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:55.958 region:rollup2
IT'S KNOWING THE BIOLOGY AND

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.760 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING IT WITH ALL THE

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:59.595 region:rollup2
OTHER ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.397 region:rollup2
AND SO. FOR INSTANCE AND ONE OF

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:03.099 region:rollup2
THE CHILD I MENTIONED AND THAT

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:04.867 region:rollup2
AND THE CHILD AT THE CITY OF

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:06.569 region:rollup2
HOPE WITH GLIOBLASTOMA.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.404 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IS THIS AMAZING

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:10.606 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY OF AN ENGINEERED

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:13.176 region:rollup2
IMMUNE CELLS THAT SPECIFICALLY

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:15.845 region:rollup2
TARGETS THESE CANCER CELLS --

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:16.479 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED BUT AS THAT

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:19.716 region:rollup2
PARALLEL STUDIES IN COMPUTATION

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:21.984 region:rollup2
--

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.720 region:rollup2
AT PREDICTIONS AND GENOMICS

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:24.954 region:rollup2
PROFILES OF WHAT THE CANCER'S

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.056 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH SO IF SOMETHING

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.590 region:rollup2
DOES HAPPEN IF IT RECURS OR

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.791 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.227 region:rollup2
NOW THERE'S MORE INFORMATION TO

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:32.962 region:rollup2
GUIDE --

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.262 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TECHNOLOGY

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.264 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:36.299 region:rollup2
SO.

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.800 region:rollup2
KIND OF A LONG WINDED ANSWER BUT

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:39.769 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IT IT'S IT'S IT THAT

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.070 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO YOUR RIGHT COMES FROM A

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:41.404 region:rollup2
VERY BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.906 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:45.975 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH MAKING SURE POLICY

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.776 region:rollup2
IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALLOWING US

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:48.411 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT MAKING SURE THE

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:50.246 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE SO CAN

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.547 region:rollup2
BE USEFUL MY REFUND FORTY

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:54.150 region:rollup2
MILLION TO THAT.

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:57.286 region:rollup2
GENOMICS INSTITUTE WHICH IS.

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:59.589 region:rollup2
STANFORD WHICH IS THAT IT GROWS

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:00.823 region:rollup2
AND LISTENING SAN DIEGO.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.692 region:rollup2
WHILE SOLICITS INSULT INSTITUTE

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:04.327 region:rollup2
THE EARLIER YOU CAN DIAGNOSIS

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.661 region:rollup2
THAT EARLIER IN THE BETTER YOU

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:06.996 region:rollup2
KNOW THE YOUNGER THE PATIENTS

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:09.565 region:rollup2
THEM THE BETTER.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:10.933 region:rollup2
YOU ABSOLUTELY OUTCOME --

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:13.102 region:rollup2
DISMAY AND JUST REALLY BRIEFLY

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:14.203 region:rollup2
MY LAST QUESTION WITH AS FAR AS

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.905 region:rollup2
BARRIERS I MEAN WILL.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:18.307 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS BARRIERS

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:18.908 region:rollup2
TO GETTING.

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.842 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATIONS TO THE BEDSIDE

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:22.311 region:rollup2
--

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:26.048 region:rollup2
COST.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:27.550 region:rollup2
ACCESS HOME YOU KNOW INVESTMENT.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.252 region:rollup2
MONEY YOU KNOW OPEN WHAT ARE THE

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:31.354 region:rollup2
BARRIERS ARE SEEING YOU KNOW HOW

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:32.121 region:rollup2
CAN WE HELP THOSE OF STATE

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:33.623 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.857 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT OF THOSE

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.626 region:rollup2
THINGS NOW THAT.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.927 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INNOVATIONS WERE

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.095 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO GROW AND LEARN.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:46.435 region:rollup2
IN HOW CAN WE GET THAT TO THE

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:49.138 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:50.773 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW ACCESS TO THE BIGGEST

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:52.175 region:rollup2
TO YEAH I KNOW IT'S A NO BECAUSE

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.842 region:rollup2
NO I I I THINK IT'S SUCH AN

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:53.509 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:55.511 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE THAT IS OUR NEW

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:56.479 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE IN ADDITION TO THE

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.480 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.916 region:rollup2
FRONTIER AND OPPORTUNITIES OF

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.284 region:rollup2
THE POLICY AND AND ACCESS ISSUES

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:02.652 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GONNA BE.

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:04.787 region:rollup2
AT IT AND I CAN'T GO HAND IN

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.923 region:rollup2
HAND WITH ALL OF THIS IN FACT WE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:08.057 region:rollup2
ARE ENABLING OUR INVESTIGATORS

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:10.092 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE CLINICAL

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:13.396 region:rollup2
TRIALS NOW. TO START GETTING

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:15.765 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HELP TOOLS SORTS ARE

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:17.967 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THEIR TECHNOLOGIES

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:19.368 region:rollup2
THERE THEY ARE BETTER AWARE OF

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.837 region:rollup2
ALL THE THINGS WEATHER'S

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:22.405 region:rollup2
REGARDING THEIR MANUFACTURING

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.039 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REGARDING HOW THEY'RE

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:23.906 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET OUT THERE TO THE

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:25.708 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:29.011 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE FINE DETAILS SO THAT

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:30.346 region:rollup2
THEY DESIGN DESIGN THE TYPES OF

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.013 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS COULD THAT I CAN

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.782 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WILL REACH THE PATIENTS

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.916 region:rollup2
IN THE AND IT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:35.651 region:rollup2
ANY GOOD IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:37.086 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS FOR YOU CAN GET A TO

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.788 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS.

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.789 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU --

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:41.290 region:rollup2
I MEAN BECAUSE THE PROBLEM OF

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:42.091 region:rollup2
LUCK I SUPPOSE SIT ON HEALTH

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.193 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
COMES UP TO HOW TO PROVIDERS

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.130 region:rollup2
EVEN KNOW THAT THESE TREATMENTS

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:49.365 region:rollup2
EXIST HOW WITH THE EDUCATED.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:51.033 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN CONTINUING EDUCATION

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.201 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE TRY TO ADD

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.769 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO CONTINUING

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.004 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THE MEDICAL BOARD AS

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:56.739 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WITH.

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:58.841 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOING IT AND YOU KNOW

01:12:56.739 --> 01:13:02.111 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE A MOM WHO DOESN'T

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:03.546 region:rollup2
SPEAK ENGLISH IN AN INNER CITY.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.947 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW IT IN A MEDICAL

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:06.616 region:rollup2
CLINIC HOW ARE THEY EVER GOING

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:08.117 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT THIS EXISTS FOR

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.252 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILD THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:11.254 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AS A

COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THE

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:14.023 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION THAT.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:15.658 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SHARE UP IT NUMBER ONE

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:17.760 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE.

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:18.861 region:rollup2
CALLS THAT IF ANYONE NEEDS A

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.696 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT IS DEVELOPED BY

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:22.298 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FUNDS.

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:23.366 region:rollup2
AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT THEY

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:25.301 region:rollup2
ARE ENTITLED TO IT IF THEY'RE

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:26.569 region:rollup2
LIVING CALIFORNIA AND RESIDENT

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:28.437 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:30.606 region:rollup2
SECONDLY MY OTHER HAT IS AYE SIR

PRO BONO IS ONE OF FIVE MEMBERS

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.876 region:rollup2
OF THE BOARD OF COVER CALIFORNIA

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:35.177 region:rollup2
WHICH OVERSEES THE A CA IN THE

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:39.048 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:40.616 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS IN SEPTEMBER WITH

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:42.718 region:rollup2
OUR GUYS ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:44.787 region:rollup2
SIDE WHO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:45.888 region:rollup2
WITH THIRD PARTY PAYERS TO LET

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:47.456 region:rollup2
THEM KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:48.157 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS MAY BE COMING DOWN

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:50.726 region:rollup2
THE ROAD.

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:51.560 region:rollup2
AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.462 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF THESE TREATMENTS

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.697 region:rollup2
MAY BE EXPENSIVE BUT FIRST.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:56.399 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE LONG RUN THEY'RE

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:57.934 region:rollup2
GONNA END UP SAVING MONEY AS

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:59.201 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS COULD YOU NOT COULD BE

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.203 region:rollup2
SPENDING FORTY BILLION FOR

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:02.471 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE FOR DIABETES OR OR

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.406 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DISEASE.

PROCESS.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:09.045 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE SEES CLINICAL TRIALS

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:10.947 region:rollup2
ARE DONE ONE SEES TREATMENTS ARE

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:12.348 region:rollup2
APPROVED THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.749 region:rollup2
READY TO GO OUT INTO THE INTO

THE OTHER IMPACT WHICH I KNOW

YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.484 region:rollup2
THIS AGENCY HAS CREATED FORTY

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.286 region:rollup2

GOVERNMENT SO THE AGENCY AS

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.570 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER STATE

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:49.705 region:rollup2
AGENCY IS GENERATING REVENUE AND

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:52.174 region:rollup2
CREATING JOBS.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:53.375 region:rollup2
BY LEVERAGING THE ONE POINT SIX

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.643 region:rollup2
BILLION IN GRANTS THAT WE'VE

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.945 region:rollup2
ISSUED ALREADY.

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:57.847 region:rollup2
WITH ALMOST ONE POINT SIX

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:59.014 region:rollup2
BILLION AND PRIVATE DONATIONS

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.316 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE LEVERAGED AS AS WE

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:02.351 region:rollup2
HAVE STOOD POINT SEVEN TO POINT

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:02.918 region:rollup2
TWO POINT SEVEN RIGHT.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.053 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.287 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:07.690 region:rollup2
SO YOU GOT YOUR FIRST ROYALTY

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:09.191 region:rollup2
CHECK YES NOW IS THAT.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:10.860 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WHAT IS WHAT OF

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:12.528 region:rollup2
ROYALTIES ARE.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.996 region:rollup2
WHAT ROLE THEY PLAY IN THE

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:15.698 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL?

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:18.000 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF THIS ORGANIZATION OF

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:19.535 region:rollup2
THIS OF THIS A ADDITION.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.737 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.805 region:rollup2
WE WON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR ROLE IN

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:25.007 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:26.475 region:rollup2
YEAH FROM THE PROP SEVENTY ONE

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.610 region:rollup2
IN THE CURRENT AGENCY BUT I

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:31.347 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:32.548 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE NAM.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.749 region:rollup2
SO.

01:17:32.548 --> 01:17:36.352 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:38.154 region:rollup2
THE UP OF THIS ON A SESSION IT

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:39.021 region:rollup2
WAS MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE AS A

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.588 region:rollup2
FINITE.

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:42.291 region:rollup2
FUNDING BASED ON THE THREE

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:44.627 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR ALLEN AND WHERE

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:45.628 region:rollup2
WE ARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF OUR

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:48.297 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AND FUNDING THESE.

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:50.399 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIALS WE EXPECT THAT

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:54.169 region:rollup2
OUR RESEARCH FUNDING BUDGET WILL

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:54.770 region:rollup2
BE EXPENDED BY TO THE OTHER --

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.871 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE STILL

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.772 region:rollup2
HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS THAT

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.307 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:59.775 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE BEYOND

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:02.044 region:rollup2
THAT REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW WHAT

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:03.846 region:rollup2
HAPPENS BEYOND THAT --

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:05.314 region:rollup2
FOR THE PERIOD FOR THE DURATION

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:08.050 region:rollup2
OF THE WARRANTS ARE CLINICAL

01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:09.518 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS --

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.986 region:rollup2
SO THE ROYALTY PER.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:13.255 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO THE STATE IT

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:17.059 region:rollup2
DOESN'T COME BACK DECIRME --

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:18.060 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE.

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.628 region:rollup2
SOME FUNDS COME BACK TO STORM

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:23.799 region:rollup2
HIDING GO INTO DETAIL BUT PART

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:24.466 region:rollup2
OF OUR KIND OF OUR PROCESS WHICH

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.734 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN --

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.735 region:rollup2
OF REALLY EFFICIENT WAY OF

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:28.571 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THE MONEY GOES TO

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:30.206 region:rollup2
WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO IS THAT WE

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:32.074 region:rollup2
HAVE MILESTONE BASED PAYMENTS.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:33.242 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.610 region:rollup2
HELP OUR GRANTEES ACHIEVE THE

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:35.144 region:rollup2
MILESTONES BECAUSE THAT MEANS

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.146 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING WELL IN THE

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
PROJECT BUT IF FOR SOME REASON

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:40.716 region:rollup2
IT JUST CAN'T WORK OUT THE

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:42.084 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.086 region:rollup2
ITS BUILT IN THAT THAT MONEY

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:46.088 region:rollup2
COMES BACK IN TO THE RESEARCH

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.890 region:rollup2
FUND SO THAT IT CAN BE DEPLOYED

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:49.158 region:rollup2
TO OTHER PROGRAMS.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:50.826 region:rollup2
OR EVEN TO THAT SAME PROGRAM

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:52.494 region:rollup2
SHOULD THAT FIX IT YOU KNOW GET

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:54.029 region:rollup2
WHATEVER'S --

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:56.298 region:rollup2
THE HOLD UP FIX NOT COME BACK

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:58.367 region:rollup2
AGAIN WITH ANOTHER APPLICATION

01:18:56.298 --> 01:19:00.369 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW I JUST.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:02.705 region:rollup2
IT KIND OF HOW WE BE CYCLE NOT

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:04.506 region:rollup2
RECYCLE BUT USE FUNDS MORE

01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:05.774 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLY BUT SO FROM READING

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.909 region:rollup2
THE REPORT CORRECTLY YOU HAVE

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.109 region:rollup2
THREE AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.178 region:rollup2
LEFT.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:11.847 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN ALLOCATE.

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:13.148 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THAT BY THE END OF TWO

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:15.150 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:17.586 region:rollup2
PASSED AWAY TODAY.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:19.588 region:rollup2
TODAY WE WERE PROBABLY

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:21.390 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE OR EXACTS A PROXY

SOUND.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.929 region:rollup2
AND SO THEN WE I THINK YOU

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.664 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND I'M TRYING TO GET OUT

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.665 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE CLUMSILY GETTING TO ON

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:31.567 region:rollup2

THAT NEED HELP RIGHT SO WHAT IS

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.077 region:rollup2
THE WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THAT

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:43.345 region:rollup2
LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY OF

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:45.714 region:rollup2
THE ORGANIZATION.

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:46.949 region:rollup2
TARA'S TO TAKE THAT.

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.051 region:rollup2
AS A STATE AGENCY WE CANNOT GET

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:50.152 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.420 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T PREVENT BOB

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:52.655 region:rollup2
KLEIN WHO WROTE THE INITIAL IT

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.923 region:rollup2

INITIATIVE --

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.565 region:rollup2
AFTER THEY COLLECT THE

01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:04.400 region:rollup2
SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY ISN'T THE

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:08.137 region:rollup2
ONLY OPTION.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.972 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT YES.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.507 region:rollup2
I AM A BE INTERESTING CAN THAT

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:13.776 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I GET HOW THAT'S

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:14.443 region:rollup2
PROBABLY OF EFFECTIVE AND GETS

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:15.577 region:rollup2

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:19.448 region:rollup2
ARM AND I AT THE WEALTHY THAT IS

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:20.716 region:rollup2
ME ONLY GOVERNMENT AND HUNDRED

01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:25.487 region:rollup2
AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:28.590 region:rollup2
SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:30.192 region:rollup2
ALL OF US LIKE ANYTHING --

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.894 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:32.695 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO TO FUND INNOVATION OF

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:33.662 region:rollup2
THIS NINETY TWO WITH THE SCIENCE

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.730 region:rollup2
THE EXPENSES THAT COME WITH IT

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.664 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.432 region:rollup2

AND YOU KIND OF GOT THIS A

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:44.273 region:rollup2
MINUTE AGO SENATOR ABOUT THAT --

WE WANT TO KEEP THAT GOING IN

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:53.682 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUED FRANKLY OUR BRAND

OF BEING INNOVATORS IN

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.552 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RIGHT --

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.686 region:rollup2
SO ANYWAY.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:59.021 region:rollup2
FANTASTIC STUFF PLEASE KEEP IT

THEY WAS GLORIA --

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:10.365 region:rollup2
WHILE WE STILL HAVE YOU AT THE

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.567 region:rollup2
TABLE WE WE LEARNED HOW MUCH

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.268 region:rollup2
BOND FUNDING IS LAUGHS --

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.737 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT TWENTY

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:18.207 region:rollup2
TWENTY BALLOT APPARENTLY PRIVATE

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:19.708 region:rollup2
EFFORT ANY SIZE OF BOND THAT'S

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:21.710 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCUSSED ARE YOU.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.644 region:rollup2
IT IS MISTER KLEIN LOOKING IN

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.613 region:rollup2
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:27.282 region:rollup2
BILLION IS LOOKING NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:30.119 region:rollup2
FIVE FIVE BILLION YES.

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:31.954 region:rollup2
AND HAVE OTHER STATES FOLLOW

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.722 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S LEAD IN THIS REGARD

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:35.391 region:rollup2
ME TALK ABOUT THE AND I AGE

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:38.894 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE FEDERAL PICTURE.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:40.996 region:rollup2
OF OTHER STATES THAT CHASING A

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.931 region:rollup2
THIS INDUSTRY --

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:45.601 region:rollup2
OR IS CALIFORNIA'S STILL VERY

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:48.337 region:rollup2
MUCH AN AL LIAR.

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:48.937 region:rollup2
MANY STATES HAVE ATTEMPTED --

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:51.039 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
STILL IN EXISTENCE BUT THE

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:55.344 region:rollup2
BUDGETS ARE AND KNOW WHERE.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:57.746 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THAT'S THAT IS YOU

01:21:55.344 --> 01:22:00.682 region:rollup2
KNOW THE MAJOR LIMITATION --

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:02.785 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER THING THAT HAS HELD

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:04.353 region:rollup2
UP SOME OF THESE EFFORTS ARE

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:05.888 region:rollup2
THERE IT OFTEN --

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.188 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM ALLOCATIONS

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:10.559 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:22:06.188 --> 01:22:12.895 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE AT THE ADVANTAGE

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:15.764 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE SERVER MODEL HAS

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:17.599 region:rollup2
ALLOWED US IS IT'S ALLOW US TO

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:19.735 region:rollup2
DEPLOY THE FUNDING WHEN IT'S

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.737 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:24.173 region:rollup2
SCIENCE BASED OPPORTUNITY.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:25.841 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN HAVING AN ARTIFICIAL

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:26.441 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KIND OF LIMITATION.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:27.776 region:rollup2
THAT'S BUDGETARY OR TIME BASED

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:30.579 region:rollup2
--

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:32.548 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALSO

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:33.482 region:rollup2
THE NIH RECOGNIZES A HUGE

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:36.118 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE.

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:37.319 region:rollup2
NAM FOR INSTANCE THAT BILLET.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:39.254 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO GET THE MILESTONE BASED

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:40.689 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS AT THEIR NOT MET BACK

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.591 region:rollup2
IN AND REDEPLOY IT.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:43.659 region:rollup2
OFTEN AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.860 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DO BECAUSE WHEN IT

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:46.728 region:rollup2
COMES BACK AND IT DOESN'T

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:48.730 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GO TO ANY YOU KNOW

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:49.898 region:rollup2
IN ANY PREDICTABLE WAY BACK TO

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:50.666 region:rollup2
THEIR PROGRAMS AND I'LL JUST GO

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:54.069 region:rollup2
BACK.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:56.738 region:rollup2
INTO THE MORE GENERAL FUND SO --

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:58.740 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN A MARYLAND IS STILL

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.341 region:rollup2
HAS A SMALL EFFORT THERE LIKE I

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.309 region:rollup2
THINK OF TWO OR THREE FTA EASE

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:02.211 region:rollup2
--

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:03.946 region:rollup2
NEW JERSEY HAD ATTEMPTED I DON'T

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:05.747 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS RE UP THIS YEAR NEW

01:23:03.946 --> 01:23:06.882 region:rollup2
YORK -- I

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:08.484 region:rollup2
THINK THEY LOST THEIR FUNDING

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:10.819 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST HAD A REAL PROBLEM

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:12.621 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.956 region:rollup2
WERE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:16.692 region:rollup2
BUT IT THAT THERE ARE ATTEMPTS

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:18.760 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THE AND SOME OF THEM ARE

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.394 region:rollup2
MAKING AT DELAWARE STARTING TO

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.762 region:rollup2
TIP.

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
RAZOR VISIBILITY IN TERMS OF

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:25.300 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING --

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:26.902 region:rollup2
BUT STORM IS KIND OF UNIQUE IF

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.436 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ONE IT'S ONLY ONE OUT

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:29.304 region:rollup2
THERE IN THE IN THE WORLD

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:30.472 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:32.241 region:rollup2
AND FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE WE

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.675 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED TO ACCELERATE THE

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:35.143 region:rollup2
HEARING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:36.512 region:rollup2
RESULT ARTICLE IN THE SAN

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:39.014 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ABOUT ON

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:40.249 region:rollup2
REGULATED STEM CELLS CLINICS AN

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:42.384 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT I'M SURE YOU.

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:43.986 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF IT WAS NEW

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:45.854 region:rollup2
HOT TO ME WHEN I READ THAT

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:47.322 region:rollup2
ARTICLE I GUESS THESE STEM CELL

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.891 region:rollup2
UNREGULATED STEM CELL CLINICS

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:50.626 region:rollup2
ARE PROLIFERATING.

01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:52.394 region:rollup2
GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:54.529 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FROM --

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:55.697 region:rollup2
YOU BOTH ABOUT.

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:57.332 region:rollup2
BUT REGULATED CLINICS IS A

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:58.133 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT

01:23:57.332 --> 01:24:00.269 region:rollup2
TO BE LOOKING AT THERE'S

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:01.870 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY A FEDERAL COMPONENT

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:03.305 region:rollup2
HERE RIGHT BUT DOING CALIFORNIA

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:05.073 region:rollup2

WAS SIGNED BY.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.812 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR BROWN YET LAST YEAR

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:12.147 region:rollup2

HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER WHO IS

TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:40.575 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FROM THEM BORDER

MEDICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.781 region:rollup2
OUT HOW MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:47.716 region:rollup2
BEEN ISSUED A AGAINST CERTAIN

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:49.117 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS THE OTHER PROBLEM

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:49.785 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A STANDSTILL

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:51.587 region:rollup2
TERRORISTS.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:52.988 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE ADVERTISE FROM ALL

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:54.823 region:rollup2
OVER THE WORLD WHETHER IT'S THE

01:24:52.988 --> 01:24:56.725 region:rollup2
CARIBBEAN WHETHER IT'S MEXICO

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:58.260 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ASIA WE HAVE THE

TREATMENT FOR YOU AND WE CAN

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.463 region:rollup2
HEAL YOU?

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:03.231 region:rollup2
THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR US

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:04.600 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RESTRICT A U.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.133 region:rollup2
S. CITIZENS RIGHT TO TRAVEL THEY

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.034 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

HEALED.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:09.938 region:rollup2
AND SO ALL WE CAN DO IS WARN

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AHEAD OF TIME.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:14.476 region:rollup2
THAT NO THERE THERE ISN'T A A

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:16.745 region:rollup2
CURE FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO FIND A

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:18.747 region:rollup2
CURE FOR THAT WE KNOW OF AND

CLINICS AND AND TOURIST

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:25.153 region:rollup2
AMERICANS MAY NOT BE ACCURATE

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:27.155 region:rollup2
AND WOULD BE BASICALLY TAKING

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:28.357 region:rollup2
YOUR MONEY VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:29.624 region:rollup2
HAPPENED DURING THE EARLY CANCER

01:25:28.357 --> 01:25:31.259 region:rollup2
DAYS IN MEXICO.

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:34.229 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW GOD NOTS FROM

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:35.831 region:rollup2

WEREN'T BUT YET A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:41.436 region:rollup2
BOUGHT INTO IT.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:43.138 region:rollup2

THEY BELIEVE WE HAVE A PLATE IS

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:14.469 region:rollup2
SO FEW SLIDES.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.103 region:rollup2
ARE THEY STILL CALLED SLIDES AND

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:18.640 region:rollup2
NOT SURE YEAH AT THAT ABOUT HER

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:19.975 region:rollup2
--

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.609 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND

CHANCE TO AT PRESENT TO YOU.

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.917 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO JUST SHOW YOU A FEW

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:30.686 region:rollup2
SLIDES ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO US

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:33.155 region:rollup2
HERE IN SACRAMENTO UM TO HAVE

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.823 region:rollup2
SERMON TO HAVE THIS FUNDING AND

01:26:33.155 --> 01:26:35.891 region:rollup2
TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:37.059 region:rollup2
WORLD LEADER IN STEM CELL

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.927 region:rollup2
RESEARCH [inaudible]

01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:40.028 region:rollup2
SO REALLY.

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:41.630 region:rollup2
THE FIELD OF MEDICINE IS

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:43.899 region:rollup2
CHANGING WE FEEL IT EVERY DAY AT

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.901 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL --

01:26:43.899 --> 01:26:47.636 region:rollup2
GENE THERAPIES GENE EDITING

01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:49.237 region:rollup2
IMMUNOTHERAPY GIVING CANCER

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:51.606 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IT A SECOND CHANCE AT

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:53.241 region:rollup2
LIFE AND REALLY SPECIALIZED AND

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:54.576 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE NEEDED FOR THESE

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:56.411 region:rollup2
LIVING MEDICINES IS NOT JUST

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:58.180 region:rollup2
PILLS IN A BOTTLER.

01:26:56.411 --> 01:27:01.383 region:rollup2
OF VIOLENCE YOU KNOW ED VACCINE

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.717 region:rollup2
IT'S LIVING MEDICINES AND SO YOU

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:04.386 region:rollup2
NEED THESE REALLY.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:06.021 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIALIZED FACILITIES IN

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:07.622 region:rollup2
TEAMS AND TO DO THAT AND THANKS

01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:08.790 region:rollup2
TO SERVE HIM.

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:11.226 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THAT

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.994 region:rollup2
HERE IN SACRAMENTO MANY OTHERS

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:14.796 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN AROUND THE STATE'S

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:16.865 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BUILD AND SUCH TEAMS AND

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:18.033 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER IT. TO BEGIN TO

01:27:16.865 --> 01:27:21.670 region:rollup2
DELIVER THESE AT A LIVING

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:23.338 region:rollup2
MEDICINE SO WE'VE A VERY.

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:24.439 region:rollup2
HONORED TO HAVE THE TEAM

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.240 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT WAS MENTIONED

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.608 region:rollup2
EARLIER --

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.043 region:rollup2
AND EVERYTHING FROM RESEARCH

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:29.644 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CLINICAL TRIALS

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:31.813 region:rollup2
FUNDED BY SIR.

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:33.415 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHAT OUR PROGRAM LOOK

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:35.083 region:rollup2
LIKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE A

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.952 region:rollup2
I CAME BACK HOME HERE TO

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:38.286 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO FRED AFTER SADDAM HAD

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
SHASTA AND WAS IT A WASHINGTON

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:43.291 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:45.160 region:rollup2
AND WAS CURSED TO COME BACK AND

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:46.962 region:rollup2
NOW AND I JUST OVER A DECADE

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.364 region:rollup2
LATER HERE'S OUR PROGRAM.

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:51.032 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE --

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:52.467 region:rollup2
ARE INTER INTER UC DAVIS AND

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:54.236 region:rollup2
THEN ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AROUND

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:57.305 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND BEYOND AND OUR

01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAMS AND THANKS

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:00.242 region:rollup2
THANKS TO CERTAIN FOR THAT.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.511 region:rollup2
OUR BUILDING STARTED OUT AS AN

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:03.545 region:rollup2
ALL PART OF THE STATE FAIR.

01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.913 region:rollup2
THE HISTORIC BUILDING THE WHEN I

01:28:03.545 --> 01:28:06.481 region:rollup2
FIRST CAME BACK IT LOOKED LIKE

01:28:04.913 --> 01:28:07.983 region:rollup2
THIS IN THE OLD WAREHOUSES AND

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:09.384 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S HIGH TECH.

01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:10.919 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING FOR STEM CELL

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:12.587 region:rollup2
THERAPIES TO SEND TO THE FACE

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:14.122 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:15.690 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.192 region:rollup2
ABOUT CERTAIN IS THAT THEY FUND

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.660 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THROUGH THE BASIC

01:28:17.192 --> 01:28:20.128 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THE DISCOVERY OF THESE

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.062 region:rollup2
NOVEL TRIALS.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.664 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PRE CLINICAL

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:23.598 region:rollup2
RESEARCH INTO THE CLINICAL

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:26.334 region:rollup2
TRIALS.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:26.902 region:rollup2
NIH REALLY DOESN'T FUND THIS

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:28.503 region:rollup2
PART IT'S KIND OF BORING TO

01:28:26.902 --> 01:28:29.671 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:31.306 region:rollup2
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:33.475 region:rollup2
HEALTH YOU HAVE WDM.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:36.077 region:rollup2
HYPOTHESIS BASED GRANT AND THEN

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:37.479 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET THESE EARLY PHASES

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:40.115 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY WILL FUND SOME --

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:41.349 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIALS BUT THIS THE

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:43.151 region:rollup2
OFTEN CALLED THE VALLEY OF DEATH

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.686 region:rollup2
IT'S LARGELY LOST WITH THE

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:46.221 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDING AND STERN HAS

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.788 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THESE REALLY

01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:47.756 region:rollup2
PROMISING THERAPIES THROUGH

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:50.125 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:52.427 region:rollup2
BASIC RESEARCH ALL THE WAY TO

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:53.895 region:rollup2
NEED THEM AS YOU WITH THAT BABY

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:55.197 region:rollup2
RONNIE EARLIER.

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:56.298 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT

01:28:55.197 --> 01:28:57.899 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE TO MAKE

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:59.367 region:rollup2
THESE INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:00.836 region:rollup2
CELLS SO THIS IS BASIC RESEARCH.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:02.437 region:rollup2
AT ITS FINEST YOU START WITH A

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:04.306 region:rollup2
LITTLE PINCHING SKIN FIBROBLASTS

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:06.041 region:rollup2
FROM THE PATIENT.

01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:07.976 region:rollup2
WE ADD FACTORS MAKE THEM INTO

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:09.578 region:rollup2
THESE INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:11.880 region:rollup2
CELLS THAT FOR ALL OF THEM.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:13.515 region:rollup2
INTENTS AND PURPOSES REALLY ARE

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.383 region:rollup2
ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:18.053 region:rollup2
EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS CAN THEN DO

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:19.487 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZATION SEQUENCING --

01:29:18.053 --> 01:29:21.122 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE THEM SAY INTO

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:22.657 region:rollup2
NEURONS STUDY DISEASE IN A DISH

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:23.925 region:rollup2
FROM THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT YOU

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:25.126 region:rollup2
HAVE THE GENETICS FROM THAT

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.728 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PATIENT.

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:28.463 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE CAN USE SOMETHING

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:30.031 region:rollup2
CALLED CRISPER TO ADD JEAN EDIT

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:31.266 region:rollup2
INCORRECT HUMAN NEURONS

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:35.136 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT THEM VERSES AT

01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:35.136 region:rollup2
CONTROLS AND AVATAR MICE THEY

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:36.805 region:rollup2
I WATCH WHAT THEY DO IN THE

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:38.273 region:rollup2
BRAIN.

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:39.674 region:rollup2
THESE NEURONS FROM THE AND IS

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:41.543 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS DON'T STEM CELLS

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:43.245 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER --

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:45.113 region:rollup2
THEY SIGNAL IF THEY HAVE A

01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:46.481 region:rollup2
DEFECT SUCH AS FROM A AT A CHILD

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:48.283 region:rollup2
WITH A NEURO DEVELOPMENTAL

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:49.784 region:rollup2
DISORDER WEEKEND TESTED

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:51.686 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DRUGS IN THE DISH AND

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:53.822 region:rollup2
SEE HOW WE CAN CORRECT THOSE AS

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:56.358 region:rollup2
SIGNALING DEFICITS --

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:58.093 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE FIRST --

01:29:56.358 --> 01:30:00.428 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT MADE VASCULARIZED

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:02.831 region:rollup2
BRAIN ORGAN NO AIDS AND SO THE

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:04.332 region:rollup2
HUMAN NEURONS CAN SELF ASSEMBLE

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:06.635 region:rollup2
INTO THESE MANY BRAINS IN

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:08.370 region:rollup2
ADDITION WHICH IS VERY COOL.

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:09.671 region:rollup2
WE USE THAT.

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:11.706 region:rollup2
TO STUDY DIFFERENT UNDER A

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:13.041 region:rollup2
DEGENERATIVE DISEASES SUCH AS

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:15.543 region:rollup2
HUNTINGTON'S AND WROTE A

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:16.511 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AS WELL.

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.946 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY LUCKY HERE IN

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:19.714 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO TO HAVE A GOOD

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:20.882 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING PRACTICE FACILITY

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:22.984 region:rollup2
THIS WHERE WE ACTUALLY DO THE

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:24.119 region:rollup2
CELL AND JEAN MANUFACTURING FOR

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:25.186 region:rollup2
THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT HOW THE

01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:26.755 region:rollup2
U. S. FDA APPROVALS.

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:28.256 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:29.691 region:rollup2
IN CONTRAST TO THOSE FOR PROFIT

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.026 region:rollup2
CLINICS THEY DON'T HAVE FTA

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:33.061 region:rollup2
APPROVALS --

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup2
WE NEED THAT HAVE TO DO THIS IS

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:35.964 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE LARGER.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:37.532 region:rollup2
LARGEST ACADEMIC GMP FACILITIES

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:38.600 region:rollup2
IN THE USA WE HAVE SIX

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:40.669 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL SWEETS.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.671 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH MANY ACADEMIC AND

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:44.139 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY PARTNERS --

01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:45.740 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC THROUGH --

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:48.276 region:rollup2
GRANTS THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.278 region:rollup2
THROUGH SERUM AND INDUSTRY IS A

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:52.147 region:rollup2
FEE FOR SERVICE SWISS IS GOOD IN

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:53.481 region:rollup2
AKRON AMHERST DATA IT'S ACTUALLY

01:30:52.147 --> 01:30:55.083 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE CALLED GOOD

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:57.886 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING PRACTICE AS

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:58.920 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO BAD MANUFACTURE.

01:30:57.886 --> 01:31:00.355 region:rollup2
ACT.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.456 region:rollup2
AND ARE ARE A DIRECTOR OF

01:31:00.355 --> 01:31:02.524 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR GERHARD CAN GIVE YOU A

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:05.093 region:rollup2
WHOLE LECTURE ON WHY THE BAD

01:31:02.524 --> 01:31:07.963 region:rollup2
PRACTICES LED TO THE THESE A GMP

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:08.563 region:rollup2
IF IF IF IT IS.

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.464 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO THAT IN

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.665 region:rollup2
INTEREST INTO.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:11.566 region:rollup2
SO THIS OUR PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WE

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.767 region:rollup2
HAVE TWENTY FOUR A STENCIL

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:13.601 region:rollup2
REGENERATE MEDICINE TRIALS ON

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:14.536 region:rollup2
GOING OVER TWENTY IN THE

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:15.170 region:rollup2
PIPELINE.

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:16.037 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH THE GREEN ARROW HAVE

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:18.807 region:rollup2
--

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:20.041 region:rollup2
FDA APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:22.711 region:rollup2
AND THE RED ARROWS ARE THOSE

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:24.779 region:rollup2

AND REALLY SPECIALIZING IN THIS

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.908 region:rollup2
OF THESE TYPES OF STEM CELL

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:29.110 region:rollup2
THERAPIES THE FIRST ONE WAS --

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:31.312 region:rollup2
THE HOPE TRIAL THAT WE DID IT IN

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:33.581 region:rollup2
OUR ALPHA CLINIC WHEN IT OPENED

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:34.916 region:rollup2
IN THEM SACRAMENTO.

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.918 region:rollup2
THE HOPE TRIAL FOR OF BOYS THEY

PATIENTS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:45.994 region:rollup2
CLINICAL TRIALS ON GOING IN OUR

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:47.562 region:rollup2
CENTER AND THE HEALTH CLINICS

01:32:45.994 --> 01:32:49.330 region:rollup2
ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:49.864 region:rollup2
HAVE IS AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC TO

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:05.079 region:rollup2
AT THIRTY THREE COUNTY CATCHMENT

01:33:03.011 --> 01:33:06.948 region:rollup2
REGION AND SO THESE PATIENTS ARE

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:08.083 region:rollup2
ABLE TO COME A INTO A CLINIC CAN

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:09.884 region:rollup2
BE TREATED IF.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:12.020 region:rollup2
THE TRIAL WAS APPROVED SO

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:13.555 region:rollup2
FINALLY THIS IS REALLY A NEW ERA

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.662 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT HAS HAD A MAJOR

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:15.997 region:rollup2
IMPACT.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.799 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:19.200 region:rollup2
TO MENTION HERE IS --

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:21.836 region:rollup2
DOCTRINAL TO MENTIONED ABOVE TO

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.403 region:rollup2
YOU HOPE LUCKY UC DAVIS WAS.

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:24.472 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE LOCK IS AND FAR

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:26.240 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:37:24.472 --> 01:37:29.977 region:rollup2
THE SPENT THE OF THE HEAD PEOPLE

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.945 region:rollup2
AT THE BOARD MEETINGS AT THE ALL

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:32.547 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE SERMON ON A

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:34.549 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

01:37:32.547 --> 01:37:35.883 region:rollup2
REGULATE AND THEY WATCHED WHERE

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:37.885 region:rollup2
THE DOLLARS ARE GOING WHAT WAS

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:38.152 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND THEY WENT OUT AND

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:41.723 region:rollup2
GOT IT.

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:43.891 region:rollup2
BUT IT UC DAVIS IS A GOOD OF

01:37:41.723 --> 01:37:45.626 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE INTENTIONS BEHIND.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:47.495 region:rollup2
THE HOME OF PROPOSITION SEVENTY

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:51.165 region:rollup2
ONE IS TO BUILD UP THE STENCIL

01:37:47.495 --> 01:37:53.701 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA --

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:55.903 region:rollup2
PUT UP I WAS IN MAZATLAN MEXICO

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:56.704 region:rollup2
THE FALL TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:58.039 region:rollup2
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:59.841 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE BEING

01:37:58.039 --> 01:38:02.910 region:rollup2
PASSED.

01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:03.778 region:rollup2
I READ A HEN A HEADLINE WALL

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.812 region:rollup2
STREET JOURNAL THAT SAID.

01:38:03.778 --> 01:38:05.713 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEW GOLD RUSH COMING

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:07.115 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA.

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:09.484 region:rollup2
AND WAS ONE INVOLVING STEM CELLS

01:38:07.115 --> 01:38:11.219 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF NUGGETS.

01:38:09.484 --> 01:38:12.420 region:rollup2
HOLY ARGONAUTS I SAID TO MYSELF

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:13.921 region:rollup2
USING THE TERM OF COURSE IT

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.923 region:rollup2
REFERS TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:17.658 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE RUSHED THE CALIFORNIA

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:18.860 region:rollup2
GOLDFIELDS IN.

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:19.394 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE I WANTED TO

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.328 region:rollup2
KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:20.895 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:38:20.328 --> 01:38:22.530 region:rollup2
WITH HIS NEW STEM CELL GOLD

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:24.265 region:rollup2
RUSH.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.066 region:rollup2
TODAY NEARLY FOURTEEN YEARS

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:26.300 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:38:25.066 --> 01:38:27.401 region:rollup2
I STILL WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.771 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:31.339 region:rollup2
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.

01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:32.340 region:rollup2
AS HE AGENCIES FORMERLY KNOWN.

01:38:31.339 --> 01:38:34.175 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT CERTAIN

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.610 region:rollup2
FACTS ARE CLEAR.

01:38:34.175 --> 01:38:37.078 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY IS UNIQUE IN

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:39.147 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND AMONG

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:40.047 region:rollup2
STATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

01:38:39.147 --> 01:38:42.083 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FOR STATE AGENCY TO

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:43.284 region:rollup2
FUND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WITH

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:45.753 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL OF IT

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:46.988 region:rollup2
PARK.

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:48.756 region:rollup2
AND ONE POINTED IT ITS HISTORY

01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:50.091 region:rollup2
IS SAFE TO SAY AS OTHERS HAVE

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:51.259 region:rollup2
REMARKED THAT THE AGENCY IS IS

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.860 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:55.029 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:57.131 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN THE WORLD FOR HUMAN

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:58.633 region:rollup2
EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH.

01:38:57.131 --> 01:39:00.601 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY ALSO OPERATES WITH

01:38:58.633 --> 01:39:01.135 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AUTONOMY

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.603 region:rollup2
THAT IS RARE IN CALIFORNIA

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:03.070 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.639 region:rollup2
COURTESY OF THE BALLOT

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:06.374 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:09.310 region:rollup2
BUT THAT MEASURE ALSO PROVED TO

01:39:06.374 --> 01:39:11.012 region:rollup2
BE BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:12.580 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY'S FINANCIAL AUTONOMY

01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:14.749 region:rollup2
IS ALLOWED TO PROVIDE A

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:16.217 region:rollup2
REASONABLY STEADY STREAM OF CASH

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:17.585 region:rollup2
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:39:16.217 --> 01:39:19.987 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IS NECESSARY TO

01:39:17.585 --> 01:39:20.988 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN THE LONG TERM RESEARCH.

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:22.056 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.591 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF WIDELY AVAILABLE

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:25.593 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS.

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:26.894 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:39:25.593 --> 01:39:28.996 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT MAJOR CARRIED THE

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:31.065 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT.

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:35.069 region:rollup2
FOR NO MORE MONEY AFTER THE

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:37.538 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS GONE.

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:38.639 region:rollup2
CASH FOR NEW AWARDS AS HASN'T

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.540 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT PREVENTION IS NOT

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.675 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO RUN OUT.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.610 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR ALL THE

01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:44.412 region:rollup2
AGENCY COULD SLOW DOWN THE PACE

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:46.013 region:rollup2
OF ITS AWARDS AND STRETCH AND A

01:39:44.412 --> 01:39:47.682 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LONGER.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:49.951 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN EFFORT UNDER WAY NOW

01:39:47.682 --> 01:39:51.953 region:rollup2
TO PRIVATELY RAISE TWO HUNDRED

01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:52.820 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. TO BRIDGE THE

01:39:51.953 --> 01:39:55.223 region:rollup2
GAP BETWEEN.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:57.091 region:rollup2
OF THE END OF TWO THOUSAND

01:39:55.223 --> 01:39:58.359 region:rollup2
NINETEEN IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY

01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.428 region:rollup2
TWENTY OVER IT'S LIFE THE AGENCY

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:02.530 region:rollup2
HAS HAVE A NATIONAL AND SOMEWHAT

01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:04.232 region:rollup2
MORE MODESTLY GLOBAL IMPACT.

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:05.967 region:rollup2
BOTH AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING.

01:40:04.232 --> 01:40:06.968 region:rollup2
AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

01:40:05.967 --> 01:40:08.903 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN STAYING THE COURSE

01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:10.638 region:rollup2
ON HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL

01:40:08.903 --> 01:40:12.306 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ONE OF THE FEDERAL

01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:14.442 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WAS BACKING AWAY.

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:15.776 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT THE STENCIL AGENCY

01:40:14.442 --> 01:40:17.645 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY STATE DEPARTMENT

01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:18.946 region:rollup2
WHOSE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO

01:40:17.645 --> 01:40:20.548 region:rollup2
PRODUCE A MARKETABLE COMMERCIAL

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:22.183 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

01:40:20.548 --> 01:40:22.917 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE SECURE OR TREATMENT

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:25.620 region:rollup2
FOR AFFLICTIONS NOW NEARLY

01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:27.455 region:rollup2
UNTREATABLE --

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.256 region:rollup2
FINALLY AND ALL BUT CERTAIN BUT

01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:30.591 region:rollup2
CERTAIN IS THE ONLY STATE

01:40:28.256 --> 01:40:31.525 region:rollup2
AGENCIES BUT TAKES BACK MONEY

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:33.060 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PROJECT WILL HEADS UP

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:34.795 region:rollup2
ON THE ROCKS.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.264 region:rollup2
BY THE END OF LAST MONTH THAT

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:37.865 region:rollup2
FIGURE TOTALED IN RECENT YEARS

01:40:36.264 --> 01:40:39.367 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR MILLION

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:40.735 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN TWO BIG CATEGORIES OF

01:40:39.367 --> 01:40:42.870 region:rollup2
AWARDS.

01:40:40.735 --> 01:40:44.538 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF OF CASH RECOVERY IS

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.339 region:rollup2
NOT A PRACTICE OF OCCURS AT THE

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:46.474 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:49.210 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THE MONEY GOES BACK

01:40:46.474 --> 01:40:51.012 region:rollup2
INTO THE POT. FOR MORE RESEARCH

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:53.114 region:rollup2
AIMED AT TREATING ALL THESE

01:40:51.012 --> 01:40:55.016 region:rollup2
HORRIBLE AFFLICTIONS.

01:40:53.114 --> 01:40:56.751 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE AGENCY HAS HIT SOME

01:40:55.016 --> 01:40:58.152 region:rollup2
SHOALS FROM TIME TO TIME.

01:40:56.751 --> 01:40:59.153 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE

01:40:58.152 --> 01:41:00.955 region:rollup2

INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. TWO YEARS

01:41:04.859 --> 01:41:09.263 region:rollup2
LATER THE IOM WHICH IS SORT OF

01:41:07.295 --> 01:41:10.565 region:rollup2
PROVISION FOR INSTANT MEDICINE

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:12.633 region:rollup2
REPORTED DISCERNMENT HAD SOME

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:14.569 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FLAWS.

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:16.070 region:rollup2
THE IOM STUDY SAID THAT THE

01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:17.905 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAD ACHIEVED QUOTE MANY

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:19.440 region:rollup2
NOTABLE RESULTS.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:21.275 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO RECOMMENDED SWEEPING

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.743 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO REMOVE CONFLICT OF

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:23.978 region:rollup2

NATURE OF THE GOVERNING BOARD.

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:31.852 region:rollup2
THE REPORT SAID QUOTE FAR TOO

01:41:30.351 --> 01:41:33.521 region:rollup2
MANY BOARD MEMBERS REPRESENT

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:34.522 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE SOME

PROPOSITION.

01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:59.213 region:rollup2

PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TWO

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:38.519 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TEN LAW.

01:42:36.117 --> 01:42:39.320 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN THAT THE IN THAT

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.588 region:rollup2
THOUGH ON NEW LAW THE

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.489 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MODIFIED THE

01:42:40.588 --> 01:42:42.023 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:43.758 region:rollup2
WITH A SUPER DEGREE WHICH

01:42:42.023 --> 01:42:45.459 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A SUPER MAJORITY VOTE

01:42:43.758 --> 01:42:47.928 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE TRIENNIAL PERFORMANCE

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:48.996 region:rollup2
AUDITS WOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.297 region:rollup2
AGENCY ITSELF.

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:51.732 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENT OVER EXCLUDES

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:53.601 region:rollup2
SITE QUOTE SCIENTIFIC

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:55.936 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE FROM THE AUDIT.

01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:56.470 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AUDIT RESULTS CAME IN

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:57.605 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:59.907 region:rollup2
CONTAINED TWENTY SEVEN

01:42:57.605 --> 01:43:00.675 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT.

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:03.077 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT PERFORMANCE

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:03.944 region:rollup2
AUDITS CAME LAST SPRING.

01:43:03.077 --> 01:43:05.546 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT FIRM MOSS ADAMS

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:07.081 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:09.116 region:rollup2
AREAS OF PRIVATE FUND RAISING

01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:10.584 region:rollup2
RETENTION OF STAFF AND BETTER

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.752 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION OF BOARD MEMBERS.

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:14.588 region:rollup2
THE BOARD WAS TOLD THAT THE

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:15.556 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAD QUOTE MADE INCREDIBLE

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:17.258 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:20.094 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE AUDITORS USUALLY

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:21.529 region:rollup2
SEAT LOTS OF GOOD THINGS.

01:43:20.094 --> 01:43:22.897 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS THE AGE OF HE

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:25.132 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ON A SELF IMPROVEMENT

01:43:22.897 --> 01:43:26.467 region:rollup2
REGIME THE EFFORT BEGAN IN TWO

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:28.369 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WAS DUBBED

01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:29.837 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TWO POINT.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:31.372 region:rollup2
OH BUT TERM WAS ORIGINALLY

01:43:29.837 --> 01:43:33.274 region:rollup2
COINED BY WHO STEM CELL

01:43:31.372 --> 01:43:34.508 region:rollup2
RESEARCHER HERE AT UC DAVIS.

01:43:33.274 --> 01:43:36.644 region:rollup2
THE NEW DIRECTION AND EMPHASIS

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:38.446 region:rollup2
WAS DESCRIBED BY THE AGENCY AS

01:43:36.644 --> 01:43:39.980 region:rollup2
RADICAL HUSSEIN DID IMPROVING

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:41.048 region:rollup2
SPEED EFFICIENCY OF ELEVATION.

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.883 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE LARGELY

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:44.251 region:rollup2
SUCCEEDED.

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:45.453 region:rollup2
AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:47.655 region:rollup2
TOOK ALMOST TWO YEARS FOR GOOD

01:43:45.453 --> 01:43:49.457 region:rollup2
IDEA TO GO FROM APPLICATION TO

01:43:47.655 --> 01:43:51.692 region:rollup2
THE FINAL FUNDING STATE.

01:43:49.457 --> 01:43:52.927 region:rollup2
THE GOAL WAS TO SHORTEN THAT TWO

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:54.128 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS DELAYS

01:43:52.927 --> 01:43:55.996 region:rollup2
IN FUNDING OR A PARTICULAR

01:43:54.128 --> 01:43:57.865 region:rollup2
CONCERN TO BUSINESSES.

01:43:55.996 --> 01:43:58.999 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN FOR CASUAL REASONS BUT

01:43:57.865 --> 01:44:00.468 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO MEAN DELAYS AND

01:43:58.999 --> 01:44:01.135 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAN THE HOPE OF A CURE

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:03.137 region:rollup2
OR TREATMENT.

01:44:01.135 --> 01:44:05.406 region:rollup2
INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

01:44:03.137 --> 01:44:06.807 region:rollup2
THIS WEEK WE AGENCY SAID THE

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:09.610 region:rollup2
CASH DELIVERY FIGURE NOW STANDS

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:10.678 region:rollup2
AT LESS THAN NINETY DAYS FOR

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:12.880 region:rollup2
CLINICAL AWARD.

01:44:10.678 --> 01:44:14.915 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:16.517 region:rollup2
FOR TRANSLATION TOWARDS.

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.351 region:rollup2
AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE

01:44:16.517 --> 01:44:19.220 region:rollup2
AGENCY WAS PARTICIPATING IN

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:20.521 region:rollup2
ONLINE CLINICAL TRIALS.

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:23.357 region:rollup2
A LOT OF STAGE BEFORE TREATMENT

01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:26.227 region:rollup2
IS CERTIFIED FOR WIDESPREAD USE

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:28.028 region:rollup2
TODAY THE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN.

01:44:26.227 --> 01:44:28.596 region:rollup2
FORTY NINE IN.

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:29.764 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ABOUT

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:31.565 region:rollup2
FIFTY PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN

01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:34.235 region:rollup2
THOSE TRIALS TODAY THE FIGURES

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:35.569 region:rollup2
MORE THAN. EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF

01:44:34.235 --> 01:44:37.705 region:rollup2
THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF

SIR POINT CERN TWO POINT OH

01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:41.108 region:rollup2
MARKED A DEPARTURE FROM WHAT

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:42.443 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE CALLED AN ACADEMIC PASS

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:44.912 region:rollup2
FAIL APPROACH.

01:44:42.443 --> 01:44:46.046 region:rollup2
TO PUT FINAL EXAM FOR

01:44:44.912 --> 01:44:46.981 region:rollup2
APPLICATION FROM INSTRUCTORS.

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:48.582 region:rollup2
INSTEAD.

01:44:46.981 --> 01:44:50.050 region:rollup2
SERVICE ENGAGEMENT MORE PARTNER

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:51.886 region:rollup2
ORIENTED APPROACH THAT CAN BE

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.320 region:rollup2
FOUND IN SOME BUSINESSES.

01:44:51.886 --> 01:44:55.322 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF FLATLY FEELING THE

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.925 region:rollup2
APPLICATION IS NOT QUITE READY

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:59.326 region:rollup2
FOR PRIMETIME THE IDEA IS TO TO

01:44:57.925 --> 01:45:00.528 region:rollup2
COACH THE APPLICANTS ALONG. TO

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:02.263 region:rollup2
HELP BRING THEM UP TO THE

01:45:00.528 --> 01:45:04.465 region:rollup2
APPROVAL LEVEL TODAY THE AGENCY

01:45:02.263 --> 01:45:05.733 region:rollup2
CAN COUNT THIRTY APPLICATIONS

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:07.101 region:rollup2
BUT ONE APPROVAL THROUGH THAT

01:45:05.733 --> 01:45:08.269 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:09.670 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT IT'S RESEARCH BUT

01:45:08.269 --> 01:45:12.039 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE SLIPPED AWAY.

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:14.608 region:rollup2
IN THE MORE DISTANT PAST.

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:16.610 region:rollup2
SAM IS NOW MUCH MORE ENGAGE WITH

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:17.144 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAN VARIANTS EARLIER

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.345 region:rollup2
YEARS WHEN IT DREW BETTER

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:19.680 region:rollup2
CHRISTIAN CRITICISM FROM SOME

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:21.549 region:rollup2
BUSINESS EXECUTIVES.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.083 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT WITH BIOTECH FIRMS IS

01:45:21.549 --> 01:45:24.351 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BRINGING TREATMENTS TO

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:25.553 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC.

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:27.388 region:rollup2
TERMS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF

01:45:25.553 --> 01:45:28.355 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING AND

01:45:27.388 --> 01:45:29.356 region:rollup2
MARKETING AND SELLING PRODUCTS

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:32.026 region:rollup2
THAT IS A MATTER LEFT TO THE

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:33.427 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR. ONE REASON FOR

01:45:32.026 --> 01:45:34.862 region:rollup2
CLOSER BUSINESS CONNECTIONS

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:36.997 region:rollup2
INVOLVES OF MATURATION OF THE

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:37.798 region:rollup2
WORK IN THE FIELD.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.567 region:rollup2
WHICH IS BROUGHT RESEARCHER AND

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:41.435 region:rollup2
A CLOSER TO REALITY BUT IS ALSO

01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:43.137 region:rollup2
BLEW UP TO DIFFERENT FOCUS

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:45.673 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE AGENCY AS TOP

01:45:43.137 --> 01:45:46.473 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT HAS CHANGED. ONE OF

01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:48.242 region:rollup2
THE MORE DIFFICULT AREAS

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:50.177 region:rollup2
INVOLVING STEM CELL RESEARCH

01:45:48.242 --> 01:45:51.912 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TREATMENT PESAR COST.

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:53.981 region:rollup2
IT IS RARE TO HEAR RESEARCHERS

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:55.249 region:rollup2
ARE COMPANIES TALK ABOUT --

01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:57.585 region:rollup2
FORTHRIGHTLY IN PUBLIC ABOUT

01:45:55.249 --> 01:45:58.919 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS.

01:45:57.585 --> 01:46:01.121 region:rollup2
THE COST OF DRUGS AND TREATMENT

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:02.256 region:rollup2
OF OUR HIGH VISIBILITY MATTERS

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:04.525 region:rollup2
FOR YOU FOLKS HERE IN WASHINGTON

01:46:02.256 --> 01:46:06.860 region:rollup2
AND FOR PATIENTS.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:07.728 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF OVER YOU SOME OF

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.864 region:rollup2
THE ESTIMATES FOR STEM CELL

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:10.898 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS AND CURRENTLY RUN UP

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:13.601 region:rollup2
TO THE AT LEAST NINE HUNDRED

01:46:10.898 --> 01:46:15.336 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:16.870 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE

01:46:15.336 --> 01:46:18.672 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MOVED TO HELP ASSURE

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:20.541 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY BE REQUIRED BY

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:22.276 region:rollup2
RECORDING GRANTEES TO SUBMIT

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:24.478 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE ACCESS PLANS WITH A

01:46:22.276 --> 01:46:25.746 region:rollup2
COPY DOT BUT THE AGENCY COULD

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:28.015 region:rollup2
WAIVE THAT REQUIREMENT.

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:29.817 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PLAYOFF

01:46:28.015 --> 01:46:30.284 region:rollup2
ON AN ACTUAL PRODUCTS?

01:46:29.817 --> 01:46:31.085 region:rollup2
WHEN WE COME INTO THE

01:46:30.284 --> 01:46:33.554 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE IS YET TO BE

01:46:31.085 --> 01:46:34.622 region:rollup2
DETERMINED?

01:46:33.554 --> 01:46:35.890 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO SOME POLICY

01:46:34.622 --> 01:46:37.358 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:38.959 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:46:37.358 --> 01:46:41.595 region:rollup2
STEM CELL PROGRAM IN THE NEW USE

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:43.564 region:rollup2
OF THE PALACE INITIATIVE. ONE IS

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:44.665 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:45.900 region:rollup2
THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH SUCH AS

01:46:44.665 --> 01:46:47.901 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND CREATE

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.203 region:rollup2
NEW STATE PROGRAMS.

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:50.671 region:rollup2
DOES THE STATE HAVE HIGHER

01:46:49.203 --> 01:46:52.406 region:rollup2
HEALTH PRIORITIES SUCH AS PRE

01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:54.174 region:rollup2
NATAL CARE THAN SUPPLYING

01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:56.010 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS WITH CASH THAT COULD

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:57.778 region:rollup2
WELL SECURE FROM OTHER SOURCES.

01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.846 region:rollup2
THIS GOES TO THE SCREENING

01:46:57.778 --> 01:47:00.014 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT GOES.

01:46:58.846 --> 01:47:01.782 region:rollup2
ON ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOT WALDRON

01:47:00.014 --> 01:47:02.383 region:rollup2
MATCH.

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:04.184 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE PAY FOR THAT INSTEAD

01:47:02.383 --> 01:47:04.985 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING FARTHER DOWN THE

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:06.854 region:rollup2
ROAD.

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:08.022 region:rollup2
IS BORROWING MONEY TO FINANCE

01:47:06.854 --> 01:47:08.856 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THE BEST WAY TO GO

01:47:08.022 --> 01:47:09.390 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:47:08.856 --> 01:47:10.824 region:rollup2
THE INTERESTS AND EXPENSE

01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:12.393 region:rollup2

MILLION DOLLAR RESEARCH AWARD TO

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:18.132 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:20.134 region:rollup2
SHOULD EXECUTIVES OF POTENTIAL

01:47:18.132 --> 01:47:21.235 region:rollup2
RECIPIENT INSTITUTIONS SERVE ON

01:47:20.134 --> 01:47:22.736 region:rollup2
THE BOARD TOWARDS THEIR

EMPLOYERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:27.274 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:47:24.872 --> 01:47:29.009 region:rollup2
JUST A SHORT LIST BUT THESE ARE

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.044 region:rollup2
MATTERS THAT WILL COME UP AND

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:31.779 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY ESPECIALLY AS A NEW

01:47:30.044 --> 01:47:33.414 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IS OFFERED.

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:34.682 region:rollup2
RETURNING TO THE EARLIER LIST OF

01:47:33.414 --> 01:47:36.617 region:rollup2
CLEAR FACTS ABOUT CERTAIN

01:47:34.682 --> 01:47:38.185 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FACT IS THAT LIVES HAVE

01:47:36.617 --> 01:47:40.454 region:rollup2
BEEN SAVED AS WE'VE SEEN SO

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:42.957 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY HERE THIS MORNING.

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:44.091 region:rollup2
AND INSERM REGULARLY --

01:47:42.957 --> 01:47:47.828 region:rollup2
OF HAS FORUMS FOR THESE SORTS OF

01:47:44.091 --> 01:47:49.930 region:rollup2
APPEARANCES BUT YET THOSE ARE

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:51.031 region:rollup2
ALL CLINICAL TRIALS AND NOT.

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.766 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE TREATMENT IS WIDELY

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:54.368 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:55.536 region:rollup2
LITTLE DOUBT EXISTS THAT THE

01:47:54.368 --> 01:47:56.637 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAS ADVANCED THE STEM

01:47:55.536 --> 01:47:57.972 region:rollup2
CELL FIELD IN THIS BUILDING

01:47:56.637 --> 01:47:59.573 region:rollup2
PORTS A CRITICAL MASS IN

01:47:57.972 --> 01:48:01.308 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:03.444 region:rollup2
THE BURGEONING RESEARCH PROGRAM

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:05.446 region:rollup2
AT UC DAVIS HAS HAD NOW HAS

01:48:03.444 --> 01:48:06.080 region:rollup2
TAKEN IN THE HUNDRED THIRTY

01:48:05.446 --> 01:48:06.980 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN CERTAIN

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.717 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:11.051 region:rollup2
IT VIRTUALLY DIDN'T EXIST IN TWO

01:48:09.717 --> 01:48:11.919 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FOUR ANOTHER IS A

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:14.655 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALFA CLINIC

01:48:11.919 --> 01:48:15.389 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:48:14.655 --> 01:48:17.024 region:rollup2
JIM NOT ONLY INVOLVES THE UC

01:48:15.389 --> 01:48:18.092 region:rollup2
DAVIS BUT UC SAN FRANCISCO YOU

01:48:17.024 --> 01:48:19.593 region:rollup2
SEE IT ALL IN.

01:48:18.092 --> 01:48:20.794 region:rollup2
UC IRVINE.

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:22.262 region:rollup2
AND THE CITY OF HOPE ON THE LOS

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:24.531 region:rollup2
ANGELES AREA ALL OF OUR PARTLY

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:26.800 region:rollup2
OPEN NETWORK.

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:29.670 region:rollup2
NONE THE LESS CERTAIN HAS NOT

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.804 region:rollup2
YET DEVELOPED AYE BUT HER BACK.

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:32.139 region:rollup2
STEM CELL TREATMENT BUT IS READY

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:32.873 region:rollup2
FOR WIDESPREAD USE.

01:48:32.139 --> 01:48:35.876 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE VOTER

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:40.914 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS AND AT THE END TWO

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:42.516 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FOUR THE AGENCY HAS

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:44.418 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF A DEADLINE BECAUSE

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:44.952 region:rollup2
OF THEM NOVEMBER OF BECAUSE

01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:46.387 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

01:48:44.952 --> 01:48:47.321 region:rollup2
AND THE END OF THE FUNDING.

01:48:46.387 --> 01:48:48.689 region:rollup2
AND THEIR BACKERS ARE HOPING FOR

01:48:47.321 --> 01:48:49.690 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BALLOT INITIATIVE IN

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:51.458 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THAT

01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:52.493 region:rollup2
WOULD OPEN ADDITIONAL FIVE

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:54.895 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE INTO THE

01:48:52.493 --> 01:48:56.430 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:58.665 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STEM CELL

01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.901 region:rollup2
THERAPY THERE ARE THREE THOUGH

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:02.302 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE A COUPLE OF GREAT

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:02.903 region:rollup2
ADDRESS AND MANAGE SHOULDN'T BE

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.671 region:rollup2
AN ELECTION.

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:06.573 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE CLINICAL TRIALS

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:08.942 region:rollup2
AT THE SERMONS OF BACKING THE

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:09.877 region:rollup2
VERNE FACE.

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:13.213 region:rollup2
THREE AND THE OF SOME OF THOSE

01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:13.414 region:rollup2
COULD BLOW OF A RESULT WITH A

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.516 region:rollup2
HEAT.

01:49:13.414 --> 01:49:17.785 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

01:49:15.516 --> 01:49:20.053 region:rollup2
BUT AS FOR NOW WE DON'T KNOW

01:49:17.785 --> 01:49:20.721 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE STENCIL GOLD RUSH OF

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:22.156 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT'S GOING TO

01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:22.756 region:rollup2
MEASURE UP TO THE GOLD RUSH OF

01:49:22.156 --> 01:49:24.725 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND THAT.

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:25.759 region:rollup2
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:28.295 region:rollup2
WELL WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:29.129 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AND AND YOUR EXPERTISE

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:31.065 region:rollup2
AND HAVING FOLLOWED THE SO

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:32.433 region:rollup2
CLOSELY FOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW

01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:33.667 region:rollup2
SO YOU MENTION THE GOVERNMENT'S

01:49:32.433 --> 01:49:34.334 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES --

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.737 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN CITED IN THE PAST

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:38.739 region:rollup2
--

01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:41.208 region:rollup2
YOU RACIST SERIES OF QUESTIONS

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:41.508 region:rollup2
OFFER FOR ALL OF US TO CONSIDER

01:49:41.208 --> 01:49:43.610 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:45.412 region:rollup2
SHOULD --

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:47.381 region:rollup2
SHOULD A BOND AN ADDITIONAL BOND

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:49.750 region:rollup2
PASS AND ANOTHER FUNDING STREAM

01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:51.552 region:rollup2
BE IDENTIFIED --

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.719 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY

01:49:51.552 --> 01:49:54.488 region:rollup2
THE IMMEDIATE --

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:56.690 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE FOR CONTINUING --

01:49:54.488 --> 01:49:58.892 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THIS WORK.

01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:59.927 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD ASSUMING THAT WERE

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:00.494 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S A BIG

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:02.996 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION BUT ASSUMING THAT

01:50:00.494 --> 01:50:04.998 region:rollup2
WERE TO HAPPEN --

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:05.632 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU FORESEE WOULD BE THE

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:07.901 region:rollup2
BIGGEST CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD

01:50:05.632 --> 01:50:08.435 region:rollup2
--

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:12.306 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THAT HAVING A

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:14.241 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

01:50:12.306 --> 01:50:15.175 region:rollup2
HAVING THESE INVESTMENTS COME TO

01:50:14.241 --> 01:50:17.511 region:rollup2
FRUITION.

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:19.012 region:rollup2
OF FOR FOR PATIENTS AND ACTUALLY

01:50:17.511 --> 01:50:21.515 region:rollup2
OF AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:22.583 region:rollup2
POSITIVE WAY.

01:50:21.515 --> 01:50:24.384 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE GOING

01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:25.953 region:rollup2
FORWARD IT WAS PRETTY MUCH OF

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:28.489 region:rollup2
YOU KNOWS BOTH THE BUSINESS AND

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:29.590 region:rollup2
AND THE SCIENCE QUESTION --

01:50:28.489 --> 01:50:31.325 region:rollup2
YOU GOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:33.694 region:rollup2
SOME PUSH BACK OF COSTS ARE

01:50:31.325 --> 01:50:35.462 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE AYE VIDEO AND THE

01:50:33.694 --> 01:50:36.897 region:rollup2
ADMITTEDLY A LOSE COSTS ARE IT'S

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.564 region:rollup2
AN EARLY STAGE IN CAN BRING COST

01:50:36.897 --> 01:50:39.299 region:rollup2
FOUND.

01:50:37.564 --> 01:50:40.634 region:rollup2
IN THE ARE ALSO ONE TIME

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.669 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS ó YOU KNOW

01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:44.137 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS C. CONTROVERSIES WHERE

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:46.540 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:48.242 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF TREATMENT THAT IS SO.

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:49.610 region:rollup2
INSECURE OR HAS SOME ISSUES

01:50:48.242 --> 01:50:53.447 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SO CLOSE.

01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:55.415 region:rollup2
OF PROBLEMS WITH THE FOOD HE A

01:50:53.447 --> 01:50:57.484 region:rollup2
PATIENT CENTERED.

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:58.819 region:rollup2
IT MINISTER THAT CAN GET RE

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:59.586 region:rollup2
INFECTED AND LOTS OF HUNDRED

01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:00.420 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS [inaudible]

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.722 region:rollup2
NOT AFFECT.

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.991 region:rollup2
SO THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN

01:51:01.722 --> 01:51:04.491 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT WILL THAT BUT THE THE

01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:06.627 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THE

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:08.428 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT SH.

01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:10.230 region:rollup2
IT'S IN THE ETSY EUPHEMISM FOR

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:10.898 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MAKE A PROFIT ON THAT

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:12.099 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU MAKE

01:51:10.898 --> 01:51:14.034 region:rollup2
A PROFIT THESE THINGS ARE GOING.

01:51:12.099 --> 01:51:14.768 region:rollup2
TO BE DEVELOPED AND THERE IS

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:16.270 region:rollup2
WORK THAT SERVICE DOING

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:18.105 region:rollup2
CONCERNING REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES

01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:21.241 region:rollup2
ARE TALKING TO INDUSTRY AND THE

01:51:18.105 --> 01:51:24.011 region:rollup2
VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS.

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:27.314 region:rollup2
HELLO AND HOW THAT OF OTHERS

01:51:24.011 --> 01:51:28.549 region:rollup2
SOLD DIDN'T GO OVER TO THE

01:51:27.314 --> 01:51:30.517 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:51:28.549 --> 01:51:32.119 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT CAN BE REIMBURSED AS

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:32.953 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

01:51:32.119 --> 01:51:33.620 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IS IS A BIG QUESTION

01:51:32.953 --> 01:51:34.855 region:rollup2
YET TO BE RESOLVED.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.489 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE STUFF THE GENE

01:51:34.855 --> 01:51:36.456 region:rollup2
THERAPIES.

01:51:35.489 --> 01:51:37.124 region:rollup2
STEM CELL THERAPIES ARE VERY

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:42.963 region:rollup2
VERY [inaudible]

01:51:37.124 --> 01:51:44.164 region:rollup2
OF AND BUT IT'S IT'S THESE GOOD

01:51:42.963 --> 01:51:45.899 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:47.901 region:rollup2
POWERFUL LIMITED CAPACITY THEY

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:50.204 region:rollup2
CAN'T TURN OUT MILLIONS AND

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:54.074 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF TREATMENTS OF OF AND

01:51:50.204 --> 01:51:54.741 region:rollup2
AND BRINGING THAT INTO A REAL

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:58.278 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS ANOTHER

01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:59.279 region:rollup2
MATTER [inaudible]

01:51:58.278 --> 01:51:59.880 region:rollup2
THAT QUIRK [inaudible]

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:03.016 region:rollup2
ARMED WITH SERVICE SOME EXTENT

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:03.617 region:rollup2
--

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:05.218 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS GOING TO GO ON THE

01:52:03.617 --> 01:52:06.486 region:rollup2
BALLOT.

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:08.755 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE IS.

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:11.959 region:rollup2
NOT ONE THAT WE WILL NECESSARILY

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:13.694 region:rollup2
ADDRESS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:52:11.959 --> 01:52:14.328 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE

01:52:13.694 --> 01:52:17.097 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IN A GENERAL CONTEXT

01:52:14.328 --> 01:52:18.365 region:rollup2
--

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:20.701 region:rollup2
YOU SAID YOU KNOW IS THIS

01:52:18.365 --> 01:52:22.603 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR APPROACH THE ONE THAT

01:52:20.701 --> 01:52:24.438 region:rollup2
WE WANT.

01:52:22.603 --> 01:52:26.039 region:rollup2
TO S. SPEND OUR TIME ON A SHOULD

01:52:24.438 --> 01:52:27.574 region:rollup2
WE INSTEAD BE LOOKING AT GENE

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:29.443 region:rollup2
THERAPY THROUGH CRISPER AND

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:30.711 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT.

01:52:29.443 --> 01:52:32.879 region:rollup2
OR FINDING --

01:52:30.711 --> 01:52:34.881 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND GLOBAL WARMING.

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:36.617 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE ONE THING I THINK

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:38.852 region:rollup2
BESIDES NUCLEAR WAR THE COULD

01:52:36.617 --> 01:52:41.255 region:rollup2
DESTROY CIVILIZATION.

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:42.589 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PRIORITIES

01:52:41.255 --> 01:52:44.524 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:46.093 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE A BOND COSTS GOING

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:47.861 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS THE COST OF THE FIRST

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:49.596 region:rollup2
BOND?

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:51.598 region:rollup2
WE WERE PAIN WHEN WE WERE

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:54.201 region:rollup2
CUTTING SCHOOLS CUTTING.

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:55.802 region:rollup2
ARE A TO Z. --

01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:57.037 region:rollup2
DISABLED IT CETERA.

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:58.605 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S A NEW FIVE

01:52:57.037 --> 01:53:00.474 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BOND IT'LL BE

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:01.208 region:rollup2
MONEY COMING OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:53:00.474 --> 01:53:02.409 region:rollup2
FUND PEOPLE.

01:53:01.208 --> 01:53:04.278 region:rollup2
OFTEN DON'T PUT TWO AND TWO

01:53:02.409 --> 01:53:05.612 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:53:04.278 --> 01:53:08.682 region:rollup2
AND THINK REALIZE IT COMES OUT

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:10.117 region:rollup2
OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET DOES.

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:11.818 region:rollup2
AND WILL WE HAVE OUR NEXT

01:53:10.117 --> 01:53:13.220 region:rollup2
RECESSION WHICH WE PROBABLY WELL

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:15.822 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE.

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:17.457 region:rollup2
WITH PAIN FOR BOTH THOSE BONDS

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:19.359 region:rollup2
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:22.963 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE REALLY NEED TO

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:24.631 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT I DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:53:22.963 --> 01:53:27.601 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:29.302 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY GOING TO GET THAT --

01:53:27.601 --> 01:53:31.605 region:rollup2
TRICKED THE THOUGHTS OF THE

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:33.240 region:rollup2
VOTERS TRADING OFF WELL SHOULD

01:53:31.605 --> 01:53:36.276 region:rollup2
BE THIS SHOULD IT BE THAT.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:38.245 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE RESEARCH INTO LA --

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:39.913 region:rollup2
HOW TO PREVENT GLOBAL WAR MEAN

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:41.248 region:rollup2
IN DEVELOPING OF TECHNOLOGIES

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:44.318 region:rollup2
THERE BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU

01:53:41.248 --> 01:53:45.919 region:rollup2
THERE IS A VALLEY OF DEATH? FOR
