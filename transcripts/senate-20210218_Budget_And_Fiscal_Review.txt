YEAH GOOD MORNING SHARE SKINNER BASTYR NIELSEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- COOLEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M HERE DOING WITH SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO- PERCENT ANSWER QUESTIONS ON A SUITE OF BILLS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF AN IMMEDIATE BUDGET ACTION AS WAS MENTIONED. THAT WILL PROVIDE CASH RELIEF TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND NEED SUPPORT TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE FORM OF GRANTS HE WAIVERS AND TAX RELIEF AMONG OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL AS- THE STARTING WITH EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT AMENDS THE CURRENT BUDGET ACTS- THIS BILL INCLUDES VARIOUS BUDGET AMENDMENTS SUCH AS- PROVIDES A HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID FOR QUALIFYING LOW INCOME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND PROVIDES TWENTY MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO RE ENGAGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDIES BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC OR TO ENGAGE. STUDENTS AT RISK OF CLEANING. THEY ALSO. SIX POINT ONE MILLION TWO SUPPORT REGION. ASSISTANCE TO UCCS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN MADE NEWLY L. ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH THROUGH THE CORONA VIRUS REALLY FELL. IT PROVIDES ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND AND SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT COUNTIES TO PROCESS THESE ADDITIONAL CALFRESH APPLICATIONS. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE. MILLION DOLLARS TO ISSUE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR ONE TIME GRANT PAYMENTS TO HOUSEHOLDS ENROLLED IN THE COMPLEX PROGRAM AND TO RECIPIENTS OF PESTICIDE SS P. AND CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANTS ALSO CALLED CAPPY. IT ALSO ROVIDES TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE CALVERTS PROGRAM BY DISREGARDING PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME FROM ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS FOR CAL WORKS VERSUS- APPLICANTS. THIS NEW POLICY ALIGNS WITH THE CURRENT FEDERAL EXEMPTION IN PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE FEDERAL EXEMPTION EXPIRES. IT ALSO PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION TO FOOD BANKS AND AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION FOR DIAPERS TO FAMILIES IN NEED- AND PROVIDES TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES- TO FIND UP TO TWENTY COUNTIES TO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. BETTER EITHER QUARANTINING AND HOME- OR IN A HOTEL. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND- THE B. B. J. OR EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISLI. FIVE LET ME SEE IF THERE'S MEMBERS QUESTIONS. SENATOR DORADO. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH REGARDS TO THE- E. I. T. C. I. T. N. IS THAT IS CORRECT THE. UNDER ITEM. THE BILL JUNIOR HAS AN ALLOCATION FOR THE RAMS FOR THE- BY S. WE WILL BE TALKING LATER ON ON IN REGARDS TO THE- I THINK IT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO OKAY. THANK YOU SIR. AND SENATOR DOLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IN THIS AB FIVE THERE'S THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT THAT- WAS- TALKED ABOUT. EARLIER WITH THE SPECULATION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE USING IT FOR- AN ILLEGAL CONTRACTED SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE'S NOT IN RUN HERE IN THIS BILL TO PUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND I WANT TO GUARANTEED IT IS NOT GOING TO GO TO PAY. LAST YEAR'S TEAM BIDEN'S- GET OUT THE VOTE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO COUNTIES AND DID NOT GO TO COUNTIES AND IT WENT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE SO THAT I HAVE TO REASSURANCE WHERE THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO GO. THE PART READ NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THE BILL DOES INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT DOES AUTHORIZE THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS- UNDER UNDER THE SECRETARY OF STATE- THE EXPENSES IN REGARDS TO THE VENDOR OR LEGALLY MADE BUT THERE WAS NOT THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLLER SO THIS IS A TECHNICAL YOU KNOW THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED HIGHER ON BUDGET ACTS. OF THIS IS JUST TECHNICAL YOU KNOW. LET ME MAKE SURE I AM SO. IN LESS YEAR'S BUDGET THE MONEY WAS ALLOCATED GO TO SCHOOLS BUT IN THIS BUDGET WE'RE ALLOCATING IT TO GO OUT TO THE SECRETARY STATE SO THAT YOU ARE YOU I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE- THERE'S A LAWSUIT ABOUT THIS AND ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF. THIS CONTRACT AND THERE'S BEEN. SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY- EVEN THAT CONTROLLER. WHO IS NOT BEEN WILLING TO PAY THIS BILL SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT. IT WASN'T RIGHT IN THE YEAR PRIOR BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND PAID. AN ILLEGAL CONTRACT BY CHANGING THE LANGUAGE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT CONTRACT WITH THE LEGAL BUT THERE WAS NOT BE A FORTY FOUR THAT SECRETARY OF STATE HEY- THERE WASN'T CLEARED FORTY AND I'LL I'LL- WILL. ASKED MY COLLEAGUE ANNIE DRIVERS TO RESPOND WITH ANY DETAILS THANK YOU. ASSURANCE ARE DROPPED OFF AND FOR CAR. THE FUNDS GO TO PAY NOT CONTRACT THE VENDOR. DID DO THE WORK ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND THE INTENT WAS FOR THIS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE STATEWIDE TO IMPROVE- VOTER EDUCATION OUR REGION. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THE WORK WAS DONE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE OR ENTERED INTO THAT CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF COUNTIES. AND THE INTENT WAS REALLY JUST AGAIN TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE SO THIS LANGUAGE JUST CLEANS UP- ARE PROVIDES THE TECHNICAL AUTHORITY FOR THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO ACTUALLY ISSUE PAYMENT TO THE VENDOR. I THINK OF I WAS A CASE OF A IS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. ACTUALLY I WAS THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DO IT I BELIEVE THAT THE SECRETARY STATE JUST DID IT. AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DAYLIGHT IT OUT THAT. THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT. THERE IS A CONTRACT THAT. OF WITH VERY. NARROW CONTRACT WITH VERY LITTLE SCRUTINY AND EVEN THE CONTROLLER. DIDN'T DIDN'T PAY THE BILL SO THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY OVER HOW THE CONTRACT WAS LET AND IN THIS BUDGET. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO GO PAY THAT CONTRACT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF A- CONSTERNATION ABOUT HOW THE CONTRACT WAS LEFT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S OUT IN THE PUBLIC TO THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT IS HAPPENING IS. THE CONTROLLER WOULD NOT PAY THE BILL THE COUNTIES DIDN'T ASK FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DO THIS CONTRACT THE SECRETARY STATE DID THE CONTRACT AND NOW A YEAR LATER WERE COMING BACK. TAKING TAXPAYERS MONEY- AND USING IT TO PAY THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON A CONTRACT THAT WAS LET OUT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. THE PUBLIC THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHO RAN THAT CONTRACT AND HOW IT WAS. TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT MEMBERS KNOW. THAT THIS IS A I DON'T BELIEVE A- THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT WE SHOULD IF THE CONTROLLER AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES AREN'T ASKING FOR THEN WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY. THAT WENT TO. A NARAL CONTRACTED IT HELPED ONE PARTY AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG. SENATOR THE YOU MADAM CHAIR- I AM FIRST OF ALL AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT- HI BELIEVE THAT THE- RESOURCE THAT ARE PART OF THIS BY BILL JUNE ARE REALLY AND RESOURCE TO GET OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE EXCITED TO BE SAYING THIS TO MEET SOME REALLY REALLY CRITICAL NEEDS IN OUR IN OUR STATE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST PROGRAM IS- IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT IN MY DISTRICT- I HAVE SIX OF THE TWENTY COUNTIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED TO RECEIVE- SOME ASSISTANCE TO HELP FARMWORKERS TO QUARANTINE DURING THE TIME OF THE CORONA VIRUS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS ALSO INCLUDES. THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S A IT'S A BRIDE- BUCKET THAT WOULD ALLOW FARMWORKERS TO BE ABLE TO ALSO RECEIVE REPLACEMENT WAGES AND I JUST WANNA- CONFIRM THAT AND THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PUTTING THAT IS PART OF THE PROGRAM I UC BERKELEY STUDY VERY CLEARLY. INDICATED THAT THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU GET THIS CALL THIS CALL VIRUS CONTROL IF YOU HAVE LOW WAGE WARN EARNERS THAT ARE ASKED TO QUARANTINE BUT ALSO HAVE TO FEED THEIR FAMILY AND SO. I'M JUST WHAT I'M LOOKING. FOR- CLARIFICATION. YEAH I'M GONNA HAVE TO QUESTION TO- BY COLLEAGUES ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE FOR THE DETAIL. GOOD MORNING SIR DR APARNA FINANCE YEAH THAT IS CORRECT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THERE IS- THE DIRECT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT- WOULD BE PROVIDED TO. THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT- HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- FIVE CENTER PAN GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST OF ALL I. WANT TO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THE BILLS WE HAVE TODAY INCLUDING THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR- CERTAINLY- ONE EXPRESSED THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE SEE THE- HOPEFULLY WE'RE SEEING THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WITH- THE VACCINATION EFFORTS AND SO FORTH THAT WERE ENGAGED AND- COVERED BUT- AS WE WERE APPROACHING THAT WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- FUNDING THAT WILL HELP. SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SO FOR THEIR IN THIS BUDGET- SAID THAT- SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL RETURN TO US I THINK IN FUTURE YEARS I KNOW THERE ARE SOME EXTRA CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT- OUR FISCAL SITUATION GOING FORWARD- I WE DID ONE PARTICULARLY- STRICTLY JUST MENTION AND- THAT- APPRECIATE THAT WE ALSO INCLUDED FUNDING TO ADDRESS- EIGHT AND STATE INCIDENTS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS- THIS CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. THIS IS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM- WELL IT'S A LONG STANDING PROBLEM IT'S GOTTEN PARTICULARLY WORSE IN THE PAST YEAR AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND EVEN MURDER AGAINST API- AND- AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE- ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- THERE IS. A SOME FUNDING TO- TO DO- VERY IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND STUDIES- SOMETHING THAT WE DID ASK IN THE LAST BUDGET BUTTON FORTUNE WAS NOT PART OF THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WE'RE ABLE TO- TO ENGAGE AND NOW TO DRESS THAT VERY IMPORTANT- NEEDS OF THE H. I. COMMITTEE WHICH REPRESENTS ACTUALLY ONE IN SX CALIFORNIANS. SO I REGION I'D VOTE- ALL RIGHTS RESERVED SUPPORT FOR THIS PARTICULAR- BUDGET. BILL JUNIOR I'M THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE MEMBERS FOR A- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND AS I IN IN THE BIG WE WILL DO THE VOTE AFTER WE HEAR ALL OF THEM AND AFTER THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING BUT I DID WELL MY OPENING REMARKS FOCUSED VERY MUCH ON OUR SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT IN OUR GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS I DO THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT SOME MEMBERS HAVE. THAT THIS BUDGET BILL PROVIDES AN INCREASE OF FUNDS TO OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR VERY NEEDED CHILD CARE IT RESTORES THE FUNDING TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM CSU'S YOU SEE AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT ALSO PROVIDES EMERGENCY STUDENT AID TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE SEEN A DROP IN ENROLLMENT. IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH I THINK NONE OF US WANT TO SEE IN THIS TIME AND- SO PROVIDING EMERGENCY STUDENT AID MAY HELP THAT. AND IT ALSO- PROVIDER FOR US. ASSISTANCE TO OUR FOOD BANKS AND DIAPER BANKS AND A SENATOR CAFIERO MENTIONED THE HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST FOR OUR- FARMWORKERS SO IT HAS SOME ADDITIONAL- RATHER NOT ADDITIONAL BUT RATHER SOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT ITEMS THAT ARE GREAT NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO AB EIGHTY. WHICH IS THE- PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU MAY- PRESENT ON THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- EIGHTY EIGHTY OR THE PARTIAL CONFORMITY TO FEDERAL TREATMENT OF HERO PROTECTION PROGRAM FRANCE TRAILER BILL AND THIS BILL ALLOWS BUSINESSES THAT RECEIPT AID HERO PROTECTION PROGRAM OR KEEP KEEP THE LOAN THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FORGET IN. UP TO TWO DEDUCT UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF EXPENSES RELATED TO THE FORGET ABOUT. IN ADDITION THIS BILL CONFORMS TO FEDERAL TREATMENT OF THE FEDERAL ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOANS I DON'T- ADVANCE BROWN'S DIFFERENTLY ALLOWING I DON'T ADVANCED GRANTS NOT TO BE TAXED AND ALLOWING DEDUCTIBILITY FOR ANY EXPENSES. RELATED TO THE GROUND. THIS IS A PARTIAL. CAN YOU THAT OUR TAX TREATMENT AND ALLOW HER TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ON A ALL. THAT HAD KEEPING YOU LOANS FORGIVEN- HOWEVER WITH FOCUS ON THE SMALLER BUSINESS. SO ALL THAT TOOK OUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS WOULD BE A TO MAKE. THEIR DUCKS FOR STATE. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE I WILL SEE IF ANY MAN OF AND THEN OF FOR YOU IN ALLOW ME TO RECORD YU- SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I ALSO WANT TO- SUPPORT OF- EIGHTY EIGHTY- I KNOW THAT- THERE ARE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT- TOOK PPP LOANS AND- USE THOSE FUNDS TO HELP KEEP THE PAYROLL GOING EVEN WHEN THEY'RE TECHNICALLY WASN'T ACTUALLY ENOUGH WORK- FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF- THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS THAT WE HAD TO- TRY TO LIMIT THE SPREAD THE CORONA VIRUS SO MANY BUSINESSES REQUIRED TO- CUT BACK THEIR OPERATIONS OR SHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER AND- THE PURPOSE OF THE PDP LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS CREATION WORK TO TRY TO HELP BUSINESSES. CONTINUE TO PAYROLLS IN FACT YOU HAD TO SPEND AT LEAST 60% OF THE MONEY ON PAYROLL ITSELF- NOT A ANY OTHER EXPENSES AND OTHE EXPENSES ARE LIMITED TO THINGS LIKE RENT UTILITIES SO IT'S VERY NARROWLY CONSTRAIN AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT- THAT WE DON'T SENSATIONALIZE BUSINESSES TO ACTUALLY TOOK WHO WHO GOT THESE LOANS AND EVEN TOOK THE STEP TO PERHAPS CONTINUE THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THEIR PAYROLL WHEN THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A HALF HOUR LATER MAS AND HAVE THEM- PLANET BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REVENUE BEING GENERATED. AND MIGHT HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN- SUFFICIENT WORK- THAT AND THAT MADE SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THIS IF THEY HAD NO SUPPORT SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IS MY ONE QUESTION FOR FINANCES IS THAT DAY- THAT IT SAID THAT THE BILL'S ESTIMATED COST ABOUT FIFTY MILLION AND THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THEN. ONE POINT ONE BILLION AND THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- I KNOW THAT MANY SMALL. WILL BE FINE THEIR- SO IF YOU'RE AN S. CORP OR YOU'RE A PARTNERSHIP YOU'RE FILING YOUR TAX RETURNS ARE DUE ON MARCH FIFTEENTH- SO LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF US WHO ARE FILING- OUR PERSONAL INTERNS ARE C. CORPORATIONS. WILL TURN APRIL FIFTEENTH- WILL BUSINESSES BE ABLE TO ASSUMING THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS- IN A TIMELY MANNER- WILL THIS. DEDUCTION BE APPLICABLES TO THE TWENTY TWENTY- STATE TAX RETURNS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IF SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- AND IT YEAH BEFORE THAT DEADLINE. THANK GOD FOR HER DEPARTMENT FINANCE- DEPARTMENT MANAGER FULLY. YES AND THE READ FOR THE URGE. AND INCLUDE THIS IN THE MEDIA PACKAGES REALLY TO PROVIDE BUSINESSES WOULD BE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO FILE- AND SO IN AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THAT IS THAT IS THE GOAL. OKAY AND JUST TO **** QUICK FOLLOW UP- BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE EXTENT OF THE MOST OF THESE COSTS RELATE TO THIS IS A TRIBUTE TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR AS THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE HE EXPECTED WILL BE TURNING IT OVER OR- PEOPLE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT FOR THIS- FOR THIS TAX RETURN WHICH WILL APPLY TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIFTY. SO CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY. THE TINY OF. TWENTY SPENT ON THE COST WOODLAND. TO CLARIFY- WE HAVE. MILLION FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION JUSTIFY. IN TERMS NUMBERS WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT TO. BUT WILL TURN IT QUESTION OVER TO OUR TECH EXPERTS CHAMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME CALL ON SEN- SORRY DOCTOR. YOU HAVE SOME ELSE. HELLO HE'S CALL A COCA GOOD.

YEAH GOING TO FINANCE AND MALIAH AM THE REAL IS- THE COST AND WE A- HUNDRED CONFORMITY FOUR BILLION- OVER SIXTY. AND SAID IS SOMETHING THAT WE- BELIEVE IT COULD AFFORD AND ALSO TARGETS THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT BEEN MOST IMPACTED- BY THE END OF. OKAY THANK YOU IN EVEN THOUGH WE ARE PRETTY.

A CALIFORNIA'S AMERICA SEVEN THAT WHEN YOU SOMEBODY YOUR DEBT THAT A TAX. EVENT I THINK I WANT TO APPLAUD THE DISTINGUISH GENTLEMAN SO.

IS YOUR BUSINESS COMES OUT SO THAT WILL FEEL THAT ECONOMICALLY. IT WITH- THE TAX RECEIPTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO IT IT MAKES SENSE AND YES IT WOULD BE NICE TO GIVE EVERYBODY ONE BY THAT.

WE KNOW AS WE ARE SITTING HERE THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE MARCHING TO AN ACROSS THE BORDERS AND THE CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES. IT DOES IT CONCERN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THESE NEW NUMBERS. AND THE BENEFITS PROVIDED THEIR TO A REALLY GOING TO BE HARMFUL ON OUR BUDGET. AT THE LEAST I WOULD SUGGEST THE ADMINISTRATION NOT. TAKE ANY ACCOUNT FOR EXTRA MONEY. WHATEVER THAT IS SEVENTEEN BILLION OR WHATEVER. BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE EATEN UP BY THE NEW OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LONG TERM INCURRING. THE NEW INDIVIDUALS RESIDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY TAKE HAVE YOU TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS ANTICIPATED.

THE ITEM THAT WE ARE HEARING AT THE MOMENT NINE. AND SENATOR NELSON WEEKLY DON'T HAVE THOSE THOSE NUMBERS- BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT- THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IS ONE TIME. AND WE'RE BEING VERY CAREFUL OF HOW WE SPEND THOSE- THAT THOSE SURPLUS DOLLARS. BURKE SEEING NO OTHER MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. BILL WHICH IS AB EIGHTY ONE. TEN AB EIGHTY ONE.

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. FOR IT SENATOR Y. CHARACTER.

AT THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS BUT BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WHICH WAS HEARD PREVIOUSLY INCLUDES THE NINETY MILLION. COURTESY OTHER AT OUR REMOTE FOLKS OKAY NINE ALL RIGHT- WE WILL THEN MOVE ON TO. AB EIGHTY EIGHT THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS AND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU MAY PRESENT. ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AB EIGHTY EIGHT OR THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TRAILER BILL THIS BILL PROVIDES IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS MANY WHO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COULD BE NINETEEN- THE PANDEMIC. THREE SIX HUNDRED TAX THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX REFUND TO ALL TWENTY TWENTY- CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ALL TWENTY TWENTY I. TEN FILERS WITH INCOME UNDER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND- I TO FILERS ALSO QUALIFY FOR THE EITC FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR WILL RECEIVE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- AND ALSO PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS- IN ONE TIME GRANTS PAYMENTS TO HOUSEHOLDS ENROLLED IN THE CALYX PROGRAM AND RECIPIENTS OF EXERCISE.

THE BILL ALSO REPEAL REQUIRE- I DOT AT THE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE SESSION FOR THE APPLE TV- TO PRODUCE A PLAN FOR TAX DODGERS AND CONSOLE. WITH FINANCE AND THE STATE TREASURER- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK CAN BE I. RECOGNIZE SO. SOME OF MY- SIDE WANTED MAKE A PEEP. ON THIS. I AM VERY VERY. PLEASED THAT THIS PACKAGE THIS GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS CAME TOGETHER AND THAT IT IS COME TOGETHER AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHICH IS PRIOR TO MOST PEOPLE HAVING YET FILED. FOR THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ARE THERE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT TAXES. AND TWENTY TWENTY SORRY WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TAXES. AND I WILL NOTE THAT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT IN EARLY IN DECEMBER OR EARLY JANUARY WITH THIS CONCEPT. AT THAT POINT WAS GOING TO BASE THE E. I. T. C. ON TWENTY NINETEEN FILERS. BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF COURSE IS THERE. ARE SOME FOLKS WHO WERE. OKAY IN TWENTY NINETEEN HAVE ARE NOW. QUALIFY FOR EITC BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF THEIR JOBS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE OF REDUCTION IN HOURS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. BEYOND WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IS FURTHER UNEMPLOYMENT BY MANY OF OUR LOW WAGE WORKERS SEVERAL FURTHER STRESS ON DAY AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS SEEN BY THE DEMANDS ON OUR FOOD BANKS AND OTHERS. SO I REALLY I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE THAT THIS HAS COME TOGETHER AND THAT WE HAVE SUCH A ROBUST PACKAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE THE LEAST RESOURCES RIGHT NOW. AND I ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT WHILE THERE WERE SOME COMMENT ABOUT IN IMMIGRANTS THAT. THE L. A. O. IN THEIR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. THE INAPPROPRIATE STIMULUS USING STATE MONEY IS THAT WE SHOULD LOOK TO TARGET THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE FEDERAL STIMULUS AND THAT IS IN MANY PARTS WHAT THIS DOES AND IN THAT IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE BY TEN FILERS FOR FOLKS TO PAY TAXES BUT MAY NOT BE. ELIGIBLE FOR THE OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS IT ALLOWS THEM TO BENEFIT FROM THIS GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS AND THIS IS ONE TIME ONLY THIS IS NOT ONGOING IT IS NOT LONG TERM THE ONLY ON GOING ITEMS IN THE ENTIRE ALL THE BILLS WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS THE RESTORATION TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGETS IN A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS BUT THIS PARTICULAR. STIMULUS TO INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY AND WITH THAT LET ME SEE I SEE SENATOR DRAWS SO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I TO RISE TO SUPPORT A. B. EIGHTY EIGHT- AND THE WHOLE PACKAGE OF. IT'S A THE THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED OUR SMALL BUSINESSES I WE COULD JUST GO ON AND ON WITH WITH THE LIST OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING TARGETED- AS HAVING THE LEAST. OF SUPPORT NOW GETTING THE SUPPORT HAT THEY NEED AS CALIFORNIANS- I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE B. I. T. C. AS WELL- AND EXPANDING TO MORE LOW INCOME WORKERS- ESPECIALLY IF THERE WERE INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL RELIEF- I THINK IT'S A GREAT STEP FORWARD IT'S AND THEN ALL KNOWLEDGE MENT. OF ALL THESE LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE LOW WAGES NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE RECEIVING LOW WAGES BUT THEY ARE WORKING HARD OR THEY HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTED WITH THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHERWISE LIKE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. ALL WOULD BE WORKING- AND JUST OVERNIGHT LOST THEIR JOBS SO I'M I'M PLEASE WITH THAT I THINK- THERE'S ROOM TO INCLUDE MORE. OF A WHOLE OUR WAR STILL NOT COVERED EITHER BY OUR STATE OR BY THE FEDERAL AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AND CONTINUING TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH A CENTER GROVE. I'M THINKING PRESIDENT I AS I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ACCOUNT WORKS THE CALVERTS SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME THAT'S GOING TO BE GIVEN TO CALVERT'S RECIPIENTS- I WASN'T AWARE THAT ANY STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING ALL OF US AND THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS WERE INTERRUPTED SO WERE THOSE PROGRAMS INTERRUPTED WHERE THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. AND THERE'S A NECESSITY TO BACK FILL A MONEY THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. I'M SURE I'LL START AN ENEMY HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- IN REGARDS TO THE QUESTION- THE- THE PROGRAM THE CALPERS PROGRAM WASN'T NECESSARILY INTERRUPTED I THINK THAT THIS IS A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THE PEOPLE RECIPIENTS- ON CAL WORKS HAVE BEEN. NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED TO THE PANDEMIC AND TO PROVIDE- CASH ASSISTANCE TO THEM CASUALLY- ON TOP OF. THAT HOW WORKS GRANT THEY'RE RECEIVING. SO IT ABSENT THE PANDEMIC THEY WOULD HAVE STILL RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAD BEEN RECEIVING THE ENTIRE TIME THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- CAN YOU JUST- ELABORATE ON WHAT THEY LOST AND HOW THEY WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IF THEY CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE BENEFIT. IT WAS ALLOCATED TO THEM PRE PANDEMIC- YES AND I THINK I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO MY COMMENTS AND IN pREGARDS TO- THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS- THE FELT BY CALIFORNIANS IT'S BEEN THOSE AT THE LOWEST INCOME- THAT HAVE BEEN MORE IMPACTED. AND SO THIS IS A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT- BABY NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. SO ARE YOU I STILL AM NOT CLEAR I GUESS AND I DON'T I DON'T NEED TO BELABOR THE POINT I'M JUST SAYING THAT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CALL MY OFFICE THAT. HAVE LOST THEIR JOB- AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SOME OF THEM HAVE MOVED IN WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OR- MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE OF THEIR THEIR APARTMENT THEY WERE RENTING. AND THEY'RE NOT CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALL CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS JUST LIKE ALL OF US AND EVERY GOVERNMENT WORKER. DID NOT MISS ONE PAYCHECK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- THEIR DICK I'M MY CONCERN IS I GUESS WE'RE ALLOCATING SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR CALYXT RECIPIENTS. BUT I WASN'T AWARE OF THE FACT THAT ANY OF THE RESOURCES HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN ANY TIME. SURE AND- AT THE GRANTS MAY NOT HAVE CHANGED BUT I WOULD SAY THAT MANY HAVE LOST JOBS AND YOU KNOW IT. CAN WORKS OF RECIPIENTS ALSO WORK. AND MANY OF THEM MAY HAVE LOST JOBS AS WELL AND SO HAVE REDUCED INCOMES- IN IN. IN RESPONSE TO. YOUR COMMENT OKAY THANK YOU MA'AM. AND SENATOR GROUPS I COULD ADDRESS THAT- YOU'RE CORRECT THERE'S BEEN NO INTERRUPTION AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE REFERENCED BUT CAL WORKS DOES HAVE A WORK REQUIREMENT. HOWEVER MANY OF THOSE FAMILIES COWORKERS APPEARANCE MANY OF WHOM WERE- SINGLE WOMEN. SINGLE MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN. THEN DID ALSO NOT HAVE THEIR CHILD CARE SO THEY- SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GO TO WORK SO THEY LOST THE INCOME OF THAT WORK FOR THEY HAD THOSE HOURS REDUCED FOR ADDITIONALLY. THEIR CHILDREN MAY HAVE GOTTEN. THEIR MEALS THREE SCHOOL BUT WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED. DOWN ARE NOT. BEING FED THROUGH SCHOOL PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE HOUSEHOLD. SO THAT IS- ONE OF THE RATIONALES FOR HELPING THOSE FAMILIES WHO WORK ON THE COVERAGE RECIPIENTS ARE AS YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THE EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE WELCOME. RIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CASH SENATOR PAN GO AHEAD. NO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND- AS OF THE PAST CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- I THINK- I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION FROM THE CHAIR. BECAUSE CAL WORKS IS NOT MERELY A CASH BENEFIT AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO BRING UP TAL WORKS PAYMENTS FOR. DEEP POVERTY TO TRY TO DRESS WE'LL TALK ABOUT HALF OF THE PARTY LEVEL RIGHT TRYING TO BE SURE WE- HELP THOSE THAT THERE'S OF- AND- THOSE FAMILIES WHEN YOU'RE ON POWER TO HAVE A TIME LIMIT AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUSPEND THAT FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DO WORK. OR EDUCATION YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET HEALTHCARE BENEFITS WE HAD A HEARING ON THAT SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THATNATURE OF THE BENEFIT STRUCTURES WE HAVE TO HELP OUT. FAMILIES IN NEED- HOW BOTH RESTRICTIVE THEY ARE. BUT ALSOTHE FACT THAT IS IT AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE CASH IT'S THE OTHER SERVICES WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. AND COMBATING THIS- IT'S PANDEMIC CELEBRATE PRECIADO CLARIFICATION BUT I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE THAT. AND I THINK THIS IS A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FULL BENEFITS. AND CAL WORKS WHICH IS NOT JUST THE CASH BENEFIT BUT THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND. SO I WOULD URGE SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO SEEING NO OTHER COM YOUR QUESTION- I WILL NOTE. THAT BEFORE WE GO TO- ARE. LAST ITEM WHICH IS A HEARING ITEM THAT- ADDITIONALLY THERE IS SOME FUNDING IN HERE TO AUGMENT WE HAVE WE HAVE. IN OUR ON GOING BUDGET PROVIDED SOME FUNDING TO PROOTE THE EITC PROGRAM THANK THE CALLIE ITC AND THE FEDERAL WITH KELLY HERE YOU CAN SEE ESPECIALLY SO THAT WE CAN. GET THE PROPER TAKE UP IN OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF IT AND THERE IS FINDING HERE AND AUGMENTATION TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT AND- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT ALL OF US% THROUGH OUR- MECHANISM. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS GET THAT WORD OUT BECAUSE- DAYS COULD PROVIDE SOME GREAT RELIEF TO MANY FAMILIES THEN SENATOR WAKO SECURE STANDING UP DID YOU EVER COME INTO YOU OKAY FINE. ALL RIGHT SO LET ME THEN GO TO THE- HEARING THAT STORY THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING PORTION. OF OUR- BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THIS IS ON B- FINE SB EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SPECIFICALLY WE ARE THE BILL IS NOT BEFORE US FORMALLY BECAUSE IT IS IN THE ASSEMBLY- SO OUR- OUR DISCUSSION OF IT OR ARE HEARING ON IT. NOW IS FOR THE- EXCUSE ME ON USE MY PROPER TERMINOLOGY- THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL SO SENATOR KIRBY ROAD GO AHEAD BEFORE WE HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE SUBSTANCE OF IT S. B. EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS CORPORATE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE OFFICE. OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. CAL O. S. B. A. TO THIS IS WILL ASSIST THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF GRANTS QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED ECONOMICALLY BY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIS BILL APPROPRIATE TWO POINT OH SEVEN FIVE BILLION. TO FIND THE PROGRAM INCLUDING FIFTY MILLION TO NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. AS WE KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE. TO SURVIVE DURING THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS WE'VE ALL RECEIVED THOSE PHONE CALLS RECENT DATA INDICATES THE CLOSE TO ONE THIRD OF SMALL BUSINESSES WILL NOT SURVIVE BEYOND THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS. MANY NONPROFITS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS THEIR RESOURCES AND FINANCES HAVE DECLINED WHILE THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES HAS INCREASED. SMALL BUSINESSES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S THREE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY. BUSINESSES WITH DEADLY WHAT BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES MAKE UP ALMOST 90% OF THE BUSINESSES AND THOSE WITH LESS THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES REPRESENT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. OF ALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE AND AS OF NOVEMBER SMALL BUSINESS REVENUE WAS DOWN 33% THIS BILL FORMALLY ESTABLISHES AND EXPANDS THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS CDE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNOR CREATED THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TWO MONTHS AGO. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE GRANTS UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT MISSION SERVICES. WITH UP TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE AND TO ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SOUS MUSEUMS AND PERFORMING ARTS COMPANIES WITH NO LIMITATION ON ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE. THE BILL SPECIFIED THE GRANT WOULD BE ALLOCATED ACROSS AT LEAST FOUR ROUNDS ONE CLOSED AROUND USING THE EXISTING APPLICANTS FROM ROUNDS ONE AND TWO OF THE PREVIOUS CODE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. ONE ROUND FOR ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND AT LEAST TWO NEW OPEN ROUNDS FOR ALL QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES. GRANT AMOUNTS VARY BASED ON THE ANNUAL GROSS INCOME OF THE BUSINESS A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN REVENUE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT WITH REVENUE BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONE MILLION. AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT FOR REVENUE OVER ONE MILLION. AS A COMEDIAN ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE GRANTS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL ARE SMALL COMPARED TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSSES. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE SUFFERED. MORE ASSISTANCE WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THESE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO STAY AFLOAT. HOWEVER SB EIGHTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT PROCESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FROM FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS BILL. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO FINANCE TO SHARE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE BILL AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE.

YES AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SOMEBODY pSANJITA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THAT THE ORIGINALLY THE CDFI THAT WAS- ASSIGNED THIS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND ROUND IT'S L'INDUSTRIE IT'S A CALIFORNIA BASED. OF A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST NETWORK OF NONPROFITS AND OTHER CITIES CDFI THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHERE THEY NETWORK AND THEY LEVERAGE THEIR CONNECTIONS AND THE RESOURCES TO REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE I'M SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO. REACH OUT AND APPLY AND IN THIS PROGRAM IT IS NOT BASED ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS ALLEN IT'S BASED ON- GOING TO ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND THEN CREATING- AN ALGORITHM THAT LOOKS AT AT. THREE DIFFERENT- ACTORS INCLUDING THE GEOGRAPHIC TO. BASED ON A CO IN NINETEEN HEALTH AND SAFETY RESTRICTIONS- THE INDUSTRY IMPACTS INCLUDING THE- THE MOST HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES. AS WELL AS- THE DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO. IT ISN'T- LEVERAGING ALL THOSE RESOURCES TO REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE BUSINESSES THANK YOU. AND CLEARLY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE- WE MEMBERS WOULD ALSO. BE GOOD TO PUT THE WORD OUT BECAUSE CLEARLY ARE. ARE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE SMALL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE MY MANY OF OUR SMALL GREEN BUSINESS GROUPS WILL BE AWARE AND THEY WILL SPREAD THE WORD HOWEVER THERE MAY BE SOME FOR EXAMPLE SMALL PARTS. ENTITIES OR STAGE COMPANIES MUSIC VENUES THAT MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR THIS AND WITH THE- THE FACT WE CALL IT A SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM BUT THE NONPROFIT. ENTITIES ARE ELIGIBLE AS WELL AS THESE CULTURAL INSTITUTION SO. OUR GETTING INFO OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL HELP GET THE WORD OUT. LET ME FEES IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR NIELSEN GO AHEAD. THE MANAGER AND MEMBERS I WANT TO. THANK SENATOR CAFIERO AND AS WELL- I HAVE TO MENTION CENTER BORDERS AS THEY HAVE BEEN PRINCIPLE AUTHORS AND SB SEVENTY FOUR MANY OF US ARE COAUTHORS. THE POINT HERE THOUGH IS.

WELL WE CAN SEE A RETURN TO NORMALCY JUST AROUND THE CORNER TOO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT RIGHT NOW. YEAH WE ALL KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THIS UNPRECEDENTED. A PANDEMIC DRIVEN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. I'M HOPEFUL THAT SB EIGHTY SEVEN ALONG SIDE THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY AID IN THIS PACKAGE. OFFERED BY MADAME PROTON ACTING SPEAKER RENDON GOVERNOR NEWSOM.

I ALSO WANT TO ECHO CENTER NIELSEN AND RECOGNIZING CENTER BOARD JUST FOR THE HARD WORK HE'S PUT IN A SMALL BUSINESS. RELIEF INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF THIS PACKAGE. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS ENTIRE PACKAGE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I THINK THIS IS THE FISCALLY PRUDENT THING TO DO. WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE WINSTON AN EXAMPLE SET BY JOSEPH IN THE BIBLE. BUT WHEN FACED WITH A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS A FEAST AND SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE- WISELY COUNSELED. THAT WE SHOULD DRIVE DOWN DURING THE FAMINE. NOW WE ARE FACING THE WORST FAMINE IN OUR LIFETIMES AND UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC DRIVEN DOWNTURN. HI THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO BORROW AS LONG AS WE PAID BACK WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD. I URGE YOU ALL TO SUPPORT THIS PACKAGE THANK YOU MA'AM. SHARE THANK YOU SENATOR MEN SENATOR GROW. AND THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SO I A TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IECE OF LEGISLATION AND I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE USING THOSE ONE TIME FRIENDS THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THAT- THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR THE STATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S PUT THIS THAT HE PUT HIM I BELIEVE A MODEST PROPOSAL IN WITH SENATOR PARTISAN SENATOR KABIRU AT DOING ALL THE LEGWORK THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR AMOUNT- I APPLIED EVERYBODY WHO'S SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT TIME ALEXA MY COMMENTS- ECHO THE COMMENTS OF A BOTH MY COLLEAGUES. AT THAT JUST PREVIOUSLY SPOKE THAT BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING AND BUSINESSES ARE HURTING AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- HAVE A MECHANISM TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE PANDEMIC I DO HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE WE DID TAKE UP- AB EIGHTY JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. ARE THESE GRANTS CAN BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STACKS ISSUES OR THE DEDUCTIONS THAT WE JUST S. WENT THROUGH- WHAT'S THE ANTICIPATION I GUESS OF THE SAME- CRITERIA FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT WORK ON THE FEDERAL P. PEOPLE LOAN PROGRAM BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY A STATE PPP LOAN PROGRAM RIGHT OR A STATE PROGRAM THAT WILL GRANDSON THE IN A BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO. ACCESS SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE PAY BACK MEDS MECHANISM ARE THE FORGIVABLE AND- IF NOT IS THERE GONNA BE TAX DEDUCTIONS ARE AVAILABILITY. FOR HOW'S THAT GOING TO BE HANDLED. DEPARTMENT OF FINE MORE ADDRESS THE- I'M NOT SURE CAREFULLY IN A FINANCE AND- THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESS FRANCE THEY'RE NOT LOANS SO THERE'S NO- NEED TO REPAY- THAT IS THAT. THANKS THROUGH TOPLINE- I'LL- I'LL ASK SOME GEETA IF SHE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. FOR THE TAX PURPOSES CAN I DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE DAY TIMBERLAND. GOOD MORNING YES SO- WHO ARE THESE THESE GRANTS ARE NOT TAXABLE THE OR NOT TAXES FOR CALIFORNIA PURPOSES WE- WE DO NOT KNOW AND CAN'T CONTROL WHAT WHETHER THEIR TAXABLE FOR FEDERAL GROUPS AS THEY THEY LIKELY ARE BUT THAT IS OUT OF OUR HANDS FOR MAKING THEM NONTAXABLE FEDERAL GROUPS THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE OF A SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLING NOW APPLIES FOR. BLANK DOLLARS AND I'M IS THAT LUCKY RECIPIENT OF GETTING THAT GRANT THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO I APPRECIATE YOU EXPLAINING THAT. THANK YOU AND SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I'M BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO NOT HAVE TO. USE THE CARES MONEY OR- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB THE COST FOR THE P. PIECE FOR OUR BUSINESS BUT I WOULD JUST SHARE WITH YOU THERE'S MANY MANY BUSINESSES OUT THERE THAT ARE. STRUGGLING AND THEY ARE LIMPING ALONG I GUESS THAT'S THE WORD THAT I THINK. I HEAR FROM MOST MY BUSINESSES ARE VERY FRUSTRATED AND CHALLENGE SO I AM. VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WANT TO COMMEND THE- LEGISLATURE ON A BIPARTISAN ROLE IT'S AMAZING WHAT WE CAN DO. WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS THAT I THINK. WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUR ECONOMY BACK MOVING AT THE END OF THE DAY. I MEAN. THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS BORROWED I MEAN YES SIR WE HAVE AN INFLUX OF MONEY RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'VE HAD THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BUDGET THAT WAS SHORT WE HAD. WE'VE WE'VE EXTENDED PROP THIRTY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD FROM. THE OTHER SENATOR ABOUT YOU KNOW ON ABOUT JOSEPH IN THE BIBLE WELL LET ME TELL YOU WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN HAD WE HAD RECORD TIMES AND WE HAVE WE HAVE RECORD DEBT TO. ON TOP OF THAT ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE RECORD. FEDERAL DEBT. AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK THAT ALL THIS GETS MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE JUST. EMAILING IT TO THE BANKS IS NOT EVEN PRINTED MONEY AND THINK ABOUT THE INFLATION. THEY WERE GONNA HAVE IN THE FUTURE. IS GOING TO BE ASTRONOMICAL TWENTY. NINE TRILLION DOLLARS. A TRILLION DOLLARS A THOUSAND BILLIONS. OF BILLION IS A THOUSAND MILLION IT'S REAL MONEY IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S FUTURE MY GRAND KIDS AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE YET. HEY THESE BILLS BACK. THE REAL OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET OUR PEOPLE BACK WORKING IN THEIR BUSINESSES AND NOT HAVE TO HELP. CONTINUE BAILOUT AND I DO WANT TO JUST USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THE SAME THING FOR OUR SCHOOLS MEDIA KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN YET FINANCIALLY AND AN EMOTIONALLY AND SOCIALLY SO I JUST THINK THE- SENATORS AND- A FOR LOOP ON A BIPARTISAN. BILL HERE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU I THINK SENATOR Y. CASKEY ROGER. OKAY I RIGHTS HAVE MONEY JOIN AS EVERYBODY REACHES THIS HAPPY PLACE WITH THIS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS- THIS BILL I REMEMBER WITH- AT THE EARLY ON DECEMBER WHEN. SOME FIRST IDEA WAS HATCHED THIRTY MINISTRATION I THINK EVERYBODY CAN CLAIM SOME BENEFIT ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT. ELEMENTS OF THIS IS THAT SOME OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY CLOSE NOW BUT THEY INTEND TO OPEN UP. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOR THE SPONSORSAND LIKE SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN. DIFFERENT LANGUAGES VERY ACCESSIBLE ON THE ON THE GO BIZ WEBSITE SO WHILE A LOT OF US ARE LOOKING BACK IS THE SCOPE AND STUFF AND ALL THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SCOTTISH CHOKING. THIS IS ALSO A FORWARD LOOKING- MEASURE BECAUSE WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAVE YOU GOT A BUSINESS OVER MILLION THAT COULD BE. TWO MONTHS WORTH OF PAYROLL FOR MANY THESE FOR MANY THESE BUSINESSES AND THAT'S- ANOTHER MESSAGE THAT HAS TO GET UP THERE BECAUSE THIS IS. THIS IS THE STIPULATION. THAT WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE. ADMITTEDLY LIVE THAT IS THAT THE CHECK FOR THEM TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THANK YOU.
