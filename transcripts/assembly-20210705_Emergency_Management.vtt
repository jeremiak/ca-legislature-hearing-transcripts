I NETWORK OUTAGES TO THE PUBLIC

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.774
UTILITIES COMMISSION. I THE

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:11.843
REASON THIS IS SO CRITICAL IS

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.111

WHY WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.162

THAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHY

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:21.719
MAPPING AS WELL AS EXPANDS THE-

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.987
THAT THE INFORMATION COULD BE

THERE'S A DISASTER DECLARATION

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:36.033
AND MAPPING HAPPENS IF A TRUCK

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.669
HITS A TELL- A PIECE OF FIBER

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.137

THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THEIR

SERVICE ISN'T WORKING. AND SO

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.819
IT BRINGS CONSISTENCY BUT THE

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.487
VAST MAJORITY OF THE COST IS

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.321
BASED OFF OF THE PUBLIC

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.657

THE STATE AND ENSURE THAT THE

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.900
RESILIENCY IS GOING TO AFFECT

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.570
SO THE POLICY QUESTION THAT I

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.638
LOOK AT IS THERE IS A COST TO

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.507
IT HOUSE I CAST COST BORN IS

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:19.710
THAT COST BORNE BY RATEPAYERS.

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:21.946
WHO ARE SPECIFIC TO WHATEVER

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:23.314
COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES THEY

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.749
ARE OR ARE IS AT A COST THAT

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.418
SHOULD BE BORNE BY FOR THE

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:34.425
INFRASTRUCTURE. A SHARED COSTS.

00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:35.025
BY AT LEAST A SHARED COST. BY

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:36.627
THE- WHO HAVE PAID. THIRTY

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:37.928
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.165
TAX MONEY THIS YEAR. IS THIS IS

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:41.665
I MEAN THIS IS CRITICAL

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:45.636
INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR OUR

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.671
PEOPLE'S SURVIVAL DURING

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:49.273
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE POWER

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.242
OUTAGES AND THINGS LKE THAT

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:54.378
AND- IF THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:57.248
COSTS TO IT IT WINDS UP BEING

00:41:57.314 --> 00:42:01.018
BORN ON. IT TURNS IT TURNS UP

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:01.685
IN THE BILL'S ESPECIALLY IF THE

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.721
PC IS INVOLVED SO THEY'LL

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.756
APPROVE THOSE COST INCREASES

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.391
AND THAT MEANS LESS PEOPLE ARE

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:08.859
ACTUALLY ABLE TO AFFORD THOSE

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:12.529
SERVICES. SO YOU KNOW IT FOR ME

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.031
IT'S AND IT'S- YOU KNOW I'M-

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.065
I'M KIND OF CAUGHT HERE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:17.601
BECAUSE- I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.403
THE EFFORT. I JUST WISH WE

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.306
WOULD WORK ON THE POLICY OF

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:24.341
SHOULD THE STATE. SHOULD WE BE

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.343
USING AS THIS IS SHOULD BE A

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.913
PRIORITY- OF FUNDING THAT WE

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:31.916
HAVE ALREADY TO HELP OFFSET

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.751
THOSE COSTS SO MORE PEOPLE CAN

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.220
BE INVOLVED. IN IT SO THEY'RE

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.389
NOT PRICED OUT OF HAVING THE

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:40.958
SERVICES. BECAUSE THAT'S TO ME

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.993
THAT'S THE DANGER IS THERE ARE

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.261
SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE PRICED

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.095
RIGHT OUT OF HAVING THESE

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:47.631
SERVICES. BECAUSE IF THIS IS A

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:49.767
HUGE COSTS BUT YOU SAY IT IS

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.635
AND IT'S ALL PASSED THROUGH ON

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:54.805
BILLS. YOU KNOW I I'VE WATCHED

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:58.409
MY BILL GO FROM 220-022-0050 IN

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:00.744
ABOUT ELEVEN MONTHS. AND

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:02.146
THERE'S JUST DIRECT I HAVEN'T

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:03.681
ADDED ANYTHING EFFECTIVE TAKEN

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.416
STEP AWAY FROM IT. EVENTUALLY

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.952
PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT I

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:08.519
THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.888
FACE HERE IN THE STATE. IS THAT

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.258
WE ARE- ONE LARGE FIRE AWAY.

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:15.459
ONE POWER SHUT OFF AWAY FROM

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:18.495
LOSING- TELECOM FOR TWO MILLION

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.164
CALIFORNIANS HAVE THAT'S THE

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.200
COST BUT WHEN YOU CAN ACCESS AT

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.268
NINE ONE ONE. WHEN YOU DON'T

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:26.804
GET EMERGENCY ALERTS BUT WHEN

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.506
THAT TRUCK HIT THAT FIBER GOING

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:30.708
UP THE HUMBLE YOU COULDN'T

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:33.243
ACCESS ATM YOU COULD USE YOUR

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.478
CREDIT CARD AT LOCAL GROCERY

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.180
STORES THIS IS LITERALLY DAYS

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:38.215
ON END WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:39.450
WHAT THE COST TO THE ECONOMY

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:41.518
IS. WHEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.587
GOES DOWN IT'S IN THE MILLIONS

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:46.123
AND IT ALSO COSTS LIVES- WHAT I

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.859
EAT IN THIS BILL- THIS DOESN'T

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:49.660
TOUCH THE PROCEEDINGS

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.929
REGARDING- SEVEN TO OUR POWER

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:54.064
BACK UP THAT DECISION FOR TWO

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.000
FOLDERS ALREADY BEEN MADE. SO

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:57.468
MINIMAL COSTS IN THE REASON WHY

00:43:57.534 --> 00:44:01.872
IS A MINIMAL COST THE STATE OF

00:44:01.939 --> 00:44:02.473
EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE TO GET

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:03.007
THIS INFORMATION. A LITTLE

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:03.540
EXTENDED OVER THE PUBLIC

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:05.776
UTILITIES COMMISSION. RIGHT NOW

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:07.111
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.078
STATE STATUTE DOESN'T ALLOW ME

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.080
TO DO THAT SO IT'S A MINIMAL

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.116
COST AND CANDIDLY IT WILL BE

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:14.385
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT BECAUSE OUR

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:17.087
ENTIRE AT TELECOM- WIRELESS

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.989
SYSTEM AS WELL AS CABLE SYSTEM

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:20.190
WILL BENEFIT FROM THE

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.592
RESILIENCY THAT THIS WILL

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:23.961
CREATE RIGHT N. AGAIN THE

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.796
POLICY QUESTION IS DO WE JUST

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.164
PAY FOR THAT OR DO WE TRY TO

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.532
PASS ALONG EVERYBODY IN THE

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.100
BILLS MAKE THE BILL HIGHER.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.069
MORE PEOPLE DROP OFF SO ANYWAY

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:32.970
THAT'S JUST THOSE ARE MY

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:34.838
CONCERNS WITH THAT I REALLY DO

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:35.672
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:38.809
THINGS IN HERE- BUT- I JUST

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:39.576
WISH WE WOULD WORK OUT THE

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:41.645
COSTS IN OUR PRIORITIES A

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:44.081
LITTLE BIT MORE- TECH TO BE

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.549
ABLE TO GET THESE THINGS DONE

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:46.917
