OF OUR TRADITIONAL DATA SOURCES

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:59.948
DURING THAT TIME- SO IT WAS MORE

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.350
THE QUALITATIVE SIDE. WITHOUT

MAKES METHODS. RESEARCH IS

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.975
GETTING OFF THE GROUND WHERE WE

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:29.144
WILL LOOK AT TRADITIONAL OUTCOME

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.579
DATA LIKE IT'S SMARTER BALANCE

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:33.348

SAY THAT THIS MODEL. CAN BE. WE

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.963
WOULD EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:37.599

WAS LOOKING FOR SO IT WON'T JUST

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.821
BE. IN A HAPHAZARD THAT A FEW OF

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:02.524
OUR HIGH POVERTY 80% THRESHOLD

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:04.859

BENEFITS BUT THE MAJORITY TO SO

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:09.697
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.699
THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO WE

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.768
ENSURE THAT THEY GET. THE

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:14.802
ADEQUATE PLANNING GRANTS AND

CALIFORNIA. SOUPS SO I THINK

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:39.193
THAT THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE-

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.763
THAT THAT WE HAVE THE TODAY-

01:26:41.829 --> 01:26:44.532
WATCH OUT KIND EIGHT EIGHT DEEP

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.868
PARTNERSHIP MA- AND IN TURN OF

OUR OUTREACH AND- OF OUR ENGAGE

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:51.639
. I THINK WE'LL I CAN THE

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.975
INITIAL IN THE MISTER CHAIR. IS

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.578
THE PERCENTAGE OF SCHOOLS. IN

DISTRICT- IN ORANGE AND KNOW

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.536
THAT THERE ARE INCREDIBLE MODELS

FOR. AT SCHOOL SO I WEEKS TO SEE

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.390
THOSE INITIAL OFTEN POSITIVISTIC

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.759

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:03.171
ON ITS OUTCOMES AND SO- YOUR TO

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:06.574
THE OF OUR WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.377
THAT THE- THAT THE RE GO TO

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:10.678
SCHOOLS WERE ARE IN INTENDED AND

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.780
THAT'S IS THERE I THINK WE TO

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.582
BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.751
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE EVEN

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:17.885
ONE TOUCH. OKAY- TWO MORE TO

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:22.557
MARKET. SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.759
OF THE SCHOOLS THE HIGH POWER

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:25.326
SCHOOLS THAT. THAT SOMEHOW

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:26.594
DIDN'T GET THEIR PLANNING GRANT

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.697
TANNER. WE DIDN'T QUITE HAPPEN

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:31.632
FOR THEM. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.267
DON'T NEED THE RESOURCES FOR

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.603
COMMUNITY SCHOOL BUT AS YOU KNOW

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.472
THEY'RE THEY'RE BUSY TRYING TO

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.373
SURVIVE YOU THIS IS THE SAME

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.042
REASON THEY NEED A COMMUNITY

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.609
SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:42.677
TRYING TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:45.012
IN SO FOCUS ON HOW ARE WE GOING
