00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:59.917
SENATOR THAT THE THE STRATEGY

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:02.019
THAT WERE USING IN THIS BILL.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:03.387
IS IS.

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:06.057
TO TAKE CARE OF CHRONICALLY NON

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:08.459
COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS THAT

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.695
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:11.862
PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:14.498
IMPROVEMENTS -- AND THAT UP OVER

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.434
THE YEARS HAVE JUST NEVER BEEN

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.202
ABLE TO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.704
THERE HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATIONS

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.739
IT BEEN VOLUNTARY AND SOME THAT

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.976
HAVE WORKED OUT VERY WELL -- IN

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.243
AND WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THAT

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.112
PROCESS AT ALL WHAT WE'RE SAYING

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.014
IS THAT FOR THESE NON

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.582
CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.950
SYSTEMS WHERE THERE IS NOT A

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:35.353
LARGE WATER SYSTEM NEXT TO THEM

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:37.855
THAT THEY CAN BE -- CONSOLIDATED

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.090
WITH THAT THERE THERE NEEDS TO

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.825
BE AN ALTERNATIVE AND THIS WOULD

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.926
GIVE.

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.894
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ALLOW A

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:46.063
NUMBER OF THESE TO JOIN TOGETHER

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.365
FOR A KIND OF MEANS OF SCALE

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.000
ACCESS RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.668
AVAILABLE AT STATE SO IN THE IN

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.503
THE INSTANCE YOU'RE TALKING

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.538
ABOUT THEY WOULD NOT BE FORCED --

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.307
UNLESS THEY THEY ARE THEY

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.975
CONTINUE TO BE CHRONICALLY A NON

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.243
COMPLIANT IN THE STATE WATER

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.513
BOARD CANNOT GET THEM TO DO WHAT

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.216
THEY NEED TO DO.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:05.683
WELL.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.419
I AM A WORM ABOUT IS OPEN -- WE

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.554
HAVE ALL THESE OLD.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.923
PROBABLY NON COMPLIANT.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.624
WATER SYSTEMS UP IN THE

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.526
MOUNTAINS.

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.428
SACRAMENTO NEWS READ WITH THE

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.529
STATE'S THAT DRIVER YOU KNOW THE

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:19.664
AREA.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.932
SO THEIR ADJACENT TO SAN JOSE

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:23.000
WATER COMPANY [inaudible]

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:25.469
BUT THERE.

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.204
I THINK ONE ONE BANKRUPT -- A

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:31.509
FEW YEARS AGO -- HOW DOES IT

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:32.276
AFFECT THOSE KINDS OF SMALL

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:33.844
MOUNTAIN?

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:37.848
WATER COMPANIES LIKE DUNN.

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.183
THE SITUATION I'M TALKING ABOUT

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.051
YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THE

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:42.520
QUESTION -- IT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:44.121
LIKE IT'S REDUCING SO YEAH OF

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:44.922
COURSE I'M SORRY DANIEL BUSTED

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.323
HAD WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.427
UTILITIES ASSOCIATION -- AND IN

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.395
IN THOSE SITUATIONS YOU KNOW THE

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:52.963
THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATOR THAT'S

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.964
GOING TO BE APPOINTED TO THE

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.599
STATE WATER BOARD IT'S GOING TO

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.134
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.769
APPROPRIATE SOLUTION WOULD BE

00:38:58.836 --> 00:38:59.837
FOR THE SYSTEMS.

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.772
SO IT MIGHT BE THE SOLUTIONS

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.274
RECIPE FOR FOURTEEN WHICH WE

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.308
THINK YOU KNOW BRIDGES AN

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.543
IMPORTANT GAP.

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.744
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE THROUGH

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.312
EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT THE

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.781

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.350
TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND THERE

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:14.452
MAY BE.

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.620
ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT IS A MORE

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.956
APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE SYSTEMS

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.758
OKAY OKAY I THINK THAT ANSWERS

BERMAN HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:18.368
CALIFORNIA.

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:20.303
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A WHY NOT BE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.671
THAT WE CAN ANALYSIS IS

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:22.939
DETERMINE WHAT THE DELTA IS

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:25.375
BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:25.975
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:26.943
ISREVENUE LOSS BECAUSE SEE WE

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.545
KNOW THE TECHNOLOGICALLY ANYBODY

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:29.946
IN BUSINESS TODAY.

CAN SIMPLY DOWNLOAD WHICH TAX

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.750
JAR SO MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.752
WOULD YOU CAN CALCULATE A SALES

BILLS TAX ON GOODS AND SERVICES.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.229
JUST IN CASE SOMEONE'S LISTENING

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.964
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. TO DO AND

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:48.832
REALLY INEXPENSIVE TO DO AND SO

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:50.233
MY QUESTION IS WHAT WHATWHY

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.100
LIMITED UNDER THESE

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.669
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN SOMEBODY WHO

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.170
HAS A BUSINESS WITH A HUNDRED

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:54.804
THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COULD BE A

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.706
SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS AS EASY TO

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.341
COMPLY.

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.242
WE DID WE WE STARTED RESEARCH ON

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.777
THIS LAST AUGUST AND WHAT WE

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.812
FOUND WAS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CD

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.881
TFA WAS THAT THE THREAT THE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:05.982
AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT WE WOULD

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.550
SEE IT AS A STATE BETWEEN A

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.052
HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:10.620
THOUSAND WAS VERY CLOSE TO IF

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:12.088
NOT EQUAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.690
COSTS THAT IT WOULD TO TO FOLLOW

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:15.358
UP ON THAT THAT THOSE NUMBERS OF

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:18.027
BUSINESSES AND SO AS AS BOTH CD

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.029
TFA AND AS ALL OF US REVIEW

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.764
THOSE NUMBERS WE DECIDED THAT TO

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.233
SIMPLIFY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.068
AND TO ALSO.

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:25.935
BECAUSE THE REVENUE OF ONCE WAS

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.737
SO NEGLIGIBLE THAT THAT IT WAS

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.439
NOT WORTH DOING IT IT DOESN'T

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:30.974
SOUND LOGICAL TO ME I CANNOT

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.141
BELIEVE.

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:33.810
THAT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T USE AN

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.411
IMPLEMENTATION TOOL IT SOUNDS

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.280
POLITICAL I GET IT BUT IT

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:38.548
DOESN'T SEEM TO ME EVEN IF YOU.

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:39.816
HE SAID TO THE AGENCY ARE NOT

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.317
GOING TO DO IT AND NOT SPEND ANY

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:43.119
MONEY ON COLLECTION SOMEBODY'S

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.654
GOING TO PAY THE TAX.

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:46.022
AND THAT'S NEW DOLLARS IT IT

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:47.857
MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT THE

00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:49.626
AGENCY WOULD I I WOULD HAVE COST

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:50.894
QUESTION THAT CONCLUSION.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.428
IF YOU CAN TELL ME THAT WILL

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:53.930
TURN IT OVER -- TO MISS PEEL

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:54.964
CIRCUS PEOPLE SOCCER IS THE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.232
DIRECTOR LEGISLATION FOR THE

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:57.767
CALVET APARTMENT TAX AND FEE

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:58.568
ADMINISTRATION WANT TO TAKE A

00:58:58.635 --> 00:58:59.469
MOMENT.

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:01.104
TO SAY THANK YOU I TO THEM AS

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.305
THEY HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.207
THIS THE DELTA -- THAT -- THE

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:05.408
SENATORS TALK ABOUT AS OF

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:05.975
APPROXIMATELY IN THIS BILL

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.410
CIRCLE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.212
ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MILLION -- ON

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.281
AN ANNUAL BASIS -- THAT'S REALLY

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:13.483
A APPROXIMATE ALL THIS STATE.

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:15.318
WOULD NOT SEE COMING INTO THE

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.587
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OUR MARKET

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.889
IS SO SATURATED WITH LARGER

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.691
ONLINE RETAILERS FRATERNAL

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.592
REPEAL STICKER TO BE ABLE TO

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.994
CLARIFY -- ANY MISTAKE THAT I

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:25.795
MAY JUST MAKE.

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.931
I GUESS YOU'RE VERY CLOSE -- IT

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:30.099
IT SAID TWELVE TO FIFTEEN

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:37.173
MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HOW

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.609
DID YOU COME WITH A NUMBER.

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.577
HOW DID -- WE BECAUSE YOU GOT

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.178
THE HATCHERIES TO COME WITH A

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:42.745
NUMBER -- WE LOOKED AT THE

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:43.413
UNIVERSE OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:43.980
FALL IN BETWEEN THE HUNDRED

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:44.647
THOUSAND DOLLAR AND FIVE HUNDRED

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.182
THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD BASED

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.817
ON CENSUS DATA.

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:49.986
IF YOU COULD AT SOME POINT A MAP

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:50.820
YEAH I JUST LIKE TO KNOW JUST.

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:52.188
CURIOUS TO ME I MEAN I KNOW

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.623
CERTAIN COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.591
THE LIKE CERTAINLY CONTRACT WITH

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:57.660
A LOT OF COMPANIES AND UTILIZE

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.762
THE AMAZON TOOL IT'S ONE OF THE

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.764
BIG ISSUES AND ON PRIVACY IN

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:02.365
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WERE

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.734
INVOLVED IN. TO ACTUALLY --

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.669
PROMOTE SALES BUT I'D LIKE TO

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:07.971
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I'M

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.272
JUST TELLING YOU INTUITIVELY IT

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.807
MAKE AND IT'S IN THE ECONOMY OF

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.175
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.343
THAT IS BEING INFORMED IN

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:15.078
DRAMATIC WAYS BY THE INTERNET

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.546
IT'S SHOCKING TO ME.

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:19.716
THAT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:20.316
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.150
DOLLARS IS ANYTHING LESS THAN A

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:23.219
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I CAN

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.153
SPEAK TO THAT FIRST OF ALL I

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.254
WOULD.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:29.726
BE HAPPY TO SHARE TO SHARE THE

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.361
DATA WILL GET IT TAKEN -- BUT

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.295
SECONDLY -- INTERNET SALES ARE

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.396
HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AND LARGE

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.565
COMPANIES RIGHT SO.

01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:36.733
THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.501
THAT ARE ABOVE THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.637
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT BETWEEN ONE

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:42.238
HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.139
THERE'S JUST NOT A HUGE.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.807
DIFFERENCE LOOK AT HAPPY TO

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:45.475
SHARE THAT ESTIMATE WITH THE I.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.409
WHY WAS THAT IN THE LAST

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.643
QUESTION IS WHY WAS THAT BY

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.879
IMPLEMENTATION DATE PUSHED BACK

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:50.413
ON THE REST THE COUNTRY'S

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.614
IMPLEMENTING IT.

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.016
ON THE EARLIER DATE [inaudible]

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.817
THE WORLD.

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:57.120
SO A FEW ITEMS -- WE'VE BEEN IN

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.755
CONSTANT COMMUNICATION -- WAY

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.391
CITY TFA THE REASON WHY -- WE

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.860
ARE LOOKING AT A BIT OF A DELAY --

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:04.961
BUT MAKING SURE THAT IT IS

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.195
IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO THE

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.363
HOLIDAYS.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.699
IS TO ALLOW PLATFORMS IN THE

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:11.300
LARGEST ONLINE MARKETPLACE IN

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.469
THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT --

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.838
IN IT IS TAKING A BIT LONGER I

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.006
EVEN THOUGH WE SEEN THIRTY THREE

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.708
STATES ADAPT JUST BECAUSE THE

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.009
COMPLEXITY OF A MARKET PLACE.

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.277
AND WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ADAMANT

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.545
IN ALL TURN OVER THE CHAIRWOMAN

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:23.379
IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.481
THAT WE HIT THAT THE HOLIDAY

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.283
NUMBER ONE IT'S EQUITY WITH --

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.118
BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.520
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.621
LOCAL GOVERNMENT VERTICALLY

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:32.989
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:33.990
&lt;c.green&gt;ENEFIT EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS&lt;/c&gt;

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.092
WILL BE -- TO CAPTURE THOSE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.127
DOLLARS MEDICARE ISSUE IN FRONT

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:38.895
OF HOUSING EQUITY MISTER

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:39.862
CHAIRMAN WITH BRICK AND MORTAR

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:40.630
RETAILERS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.898
THE SALES TAX RIGHT NOW.

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:42.899
YOU'RE GIVEN THIS GOT THE

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.068
EVERYBODY ONLINE ABILITY NOT TO

PAY THE SALES TAX NOT JUST THE

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:47.937
REVENUE FROM THE STATE.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.005
BUT IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.140
IN BRICK AND MORTAR AND ONLINE

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.141

OBLIGATION TO PAY.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.446
EQUITY WOULD MEAN THAT THEY

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.513
WOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.915
AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT --

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.450

THING IS SOME MARKET.

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.986
PLACE FACILITATORS ARE STILL IN

NOT JUST SIZE WHY IS THAT THE

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.292

HOW DO WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.097

AND TO THAT ED TO THAT EFFECT I

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:27.603
DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.438
NECESSARILY -- HOWEVER THEY WERE

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:33.009
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WHERE WE

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.310
DO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:34.977
THE FACT THAT YES IN OTHER THIS

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.345
HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND PEOPLE

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.514

OUR STANDARD IMMEDIATELY --

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.784
HOWEVER I THINK WITH THE COURSE

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.953
OF HOW EASY IT IS AND HOW HARD

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.221
IT WAS TO ACTUALLY COLLECT THE

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.390
INFORMATION THEY HAD NOT FULLY

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.392
PREPARED SOME OF THEM.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:49.992
IN THAT IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:51.027
HAVE.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.728
WE HAD TO MAKE BASIC DECISIONS

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:55.731
ON HOW WE WERE GOING TO GO ABOUT

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:56.699
AND DO THIS IN A WAY THAT WAS A

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.601
SEAMLESS IMPOSSIBLE BOTH FOR THE

01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:59.802

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.332
NEGATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE THE

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:06.167
SALES TAX REVENUE LOST.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:08.202
FROM THE COW PALACE THE FUTURE

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:10.471
SALES TAX REVENUE FROM GENERATED

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.607
BY THIS NEW AUTHORITY WILL NOT

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:16.043
BE ALLOCATED THROUGH AB.

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:16.677
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE THERE'S NO

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.112
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.914
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN SO EVERY

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.883
DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATION EVERY

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.651

BY THIS TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:30.992
I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:31.959
AND IF YOU JUST.

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:34.896
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THE CALCULUS

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:36.564
IS SUCCESSFUL FROM A FISCAL

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.933
BASIS IT'S GENERATING REVENUE

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.334
EVERY YEAR.

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.469
IT'S PUTTING MONEY BACK IN THE

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:44.038
FACILITY IS IT ABLE TO ACTUALLY

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.139
PUT ALL THE MONEY THAT'S

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.141
NECESSARY BACK INTO THE FACILITY

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:47.742
TO MAKE IT [inaudible]

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.710
MODERN.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.946
NOT NOT AT ONE CHUNK NOT IN

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.514
THERE'S NOT ONE DISTRICT

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:55.082
ASSOCIATION IN THE STATE THE

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.218
TABLE TO DO THAT BUT THEY'RE ALL

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.719
STARTING TO WORK IN THAT EFFORT

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.621
WERE SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR PUT

01:31:00.688 --> 01:31:02.023
FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONIES

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:03.457
FOR DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATIONS.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.293
THERE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:08.596
IMPROVEMENTS ARE HAPPENING SO.

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.031
THIS ELEMENT OF THE BILL WHICH

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:11.766
ISN'T NEW TO THE BILL THIS

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.401
TRANSFER PROPERTY.

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:14.969
IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING ON A

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.971
STATEWIDE BASIS THE LAST THING

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:19.507
I'D LIKE TO SAY MISTER CHAIR.

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:20.474
IS THAT.

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:25.179
I THINK THAT IT'S OF IT WAS

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.114
MISSTATED EARLIER THAT THERE WAS

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:30.251
BEEN LIP SERVICE PAID TO THE

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.720
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO DEVELOP

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:34.255
THE PROPERTY IN CALCULUS.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:35.523
THERE'S TWELVE POINT FIVE ACRES

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.291
AT THE COW PALACE HAS RIGHT NOW

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.160
THAT IS CONSIDERED THE UPPER

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:42.230
PARKING LOT IT IS AN ADJACENT TO

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:43.664
TWELVE POINT FIVE ACRES OF

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:44.799
PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY WHICH

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.101
IS THEN ADJACENT TO PROPERTY

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.736
OWNED BY DALY CITY. SEVEN TO TEN

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:50.738
YEARS AGO.

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:52.106
THERE WERE THEY WERE ALMOST TO

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.641
THE POINT OF HAVING AGREEMENT TO

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.476
DEVELOP THAT ENTIRE PART OF THE

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:56.444
PROPERTY.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.645
THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THAT

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.113
WOULD HAVE GENERATED REVENUE FOR

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.548
THE CAPITALISTS AND THEN THE

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:03.050
RECESSION HIT.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:05.319
AND THE DEVELOPERS WALKED AWAY.

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:06.888
THERE'S NOW NEW MANAGEMENT AT

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.422
THE CITY OF DALY CITY THERE'S

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.824
NOW RENEWED INTEREST BY THE

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:12.093
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:13.127
COW PALACE IS ENGAGING IN

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.596
CONVERSATIONS. TO DEVELOP.

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.898
OR POTENTIALLY DEVELOP THAT

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.966
PROPERTY BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.768
IT'S A STATE AGENCY THEY HAVE TO

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:21.836
WORK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:22.837
GENERAL SERVICES.

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.839
BUT THERE IS A GENUINE INTEREST

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:26.641
THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.242
THERE WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. TO

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.144
TRY TO PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT BACK

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.746
TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THAT

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:32.546
ACREAGE.

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:35.349
THAT IS EASILY DEVELOPED BECAUSE

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.951
OF THE WAY IT SITS WITH OTHER

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:41.555

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:42.757
IS GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF.

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:43.958

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:03.443
LEGISLATION TO TRANSFER THE LAND

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.045
IT WAS THIS CONTINUAL DEFENSE OF

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.747
THE GUN SHOWS WE SAW IT AND

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.181
CENTER COPS LETTER A DEFENSE OF

01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:08.815
THE GUN SHOWS.

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:18.125
SO EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.427
THIS AGENCY CONTINUES NOT.

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.662
TO EITHER HERE OR UNDERSTAND

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:22.462
WHAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:24.064
SAYING THIS IS NOT A LAND GRAB.

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:25.098
THIS IS NOT ME OR ANYONE IS

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:25.732
GRABBING THE LAND THIS IS ABOUT

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.533
THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.735

SAN FRANCISCO MAKING DECISIONS.

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.506
ABOUT THE FUTURE ABOUT LAND

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.708
THAT'S NOT A LAND GRAB THIS IS A

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:35.842
PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:37.344
SO THEY CAN BE PUBLIC DECISION

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:41.081
MAKING BY ELECTED OFFICIALS --

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:43.083
ABOUT THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:45.218
CENTER COP MENTIONED THAT THE

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.621
DALY CITY POLICE AND AT A

01:43:47.688 --> 01:43:49.656
SEVENTY ANS OF PD ARE USING THE

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:52.793
SITE -- THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:54.962
AS A REMINDER UNANIMOUS VOTES

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:56.430
FROM THE GOVERNING BODIES OF

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:58.599

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:01.068
THIS LEGISLATION -- SO.

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:03.103

ACRES OF LARGELY ON USE LAND --

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:09.977
YOU CAN MAKE SOME USE OF IT BUT

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:12.245
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.246
USE OF OUR LAND AND THAT SHOULD

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.849

THE CONCERN ALSO IS THE THREAT

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:38.038
TO THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:40.040

OF THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:49.049
AND THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.150
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE THE

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:51.551
GOVERNING THAT THIS IS NON

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:52.919

ANY CITY.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.028
FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE COULD DECIDE

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:02.729
THERE WAS A LOT OF MORE REVENUE

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:03.664
IN.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.565

FRUSTRATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.611
WOULD COME HERE.

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:19.012
AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.714

FROM THE STATE RIGHT AND AT THAT

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:03.730

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:11.304
IT'S STILL IN THE CHART OF

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:13.340
ACCOUNTS -- BUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:13.907
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:15.809
CRISIS -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:16.710
USED TO BUDGET A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:17.911
LOUIS PROBABLY CAN TELL YOU HOW

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:18.912
MUCH WAS BUDGETED.

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.747
A WE FOUGHT FOR IT TO GET SOME

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:23.216
MONEY BACK INTO THE BUDGET --

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:27.454

THEN IT WAS NEVER RESTORED.

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:33.226
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:34.928
OF THE COMPOUNDING PROBLEMS HAVE

01:50:34.995 --> 01:50:36.529
OCCURRED BECAUSE THE MONEY WAS

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:39.165

FAIRS ASSOCIATION I IN FACT A

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.358
HORSE RACING WAS LEGALIZED IN

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.060
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.328
NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AS BECAUSE

GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S TERM --

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:18.438

DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE.

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.945
AND THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:27.981
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS I NEVER

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:29.482
REALLY REACHED THAT AND SO

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.317
REALLY AT THE HEYDAY I THINK WE

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:32.886
WERE RECEIVING ABOUT THIRTY TWO

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.254
MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.855
WOULD THEN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.023
OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:39.225
THEY WOULD THEN DISTRIBUTE THAT

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.127
AMONGST THE FAIRS DISTRICT

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:42.729

EXPENSES BUT THEN THEY ALSO

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.935
COVERED OTHER -- AREAS LIKE

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.570
INSURANCE COSTS WORKERS

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:57.610
THE RECESSION HIT.

01:51:57.677 --> 01:52:00.280
A GOVERNOR BROWN A RESCINDED ALL

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:00.947

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:08.254
WERE LEFT TO SURVIVE ON JUST

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:10.123
WHAT THE GENERATED A GOVERNOR

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:13.693

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:33.940
SO -- THESE.

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:35.074
FAIR GROUNDS ARE ON THE RUN.

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:36.042

01:53:59.532 --> 01:54:00.433
THESE FACILITIES.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.468
SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS --

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:06.239
SENATOR -- IF IF THE BIG ISSUE

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:08.274
FIRST WAS THE GUN SHOW WHITE ONE

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:09.309
IS IN THE STATE JUST.

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.243
THEY WOULD BE EARNING ON THE GUN

YOU AND SWAP IT OUT.

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:17.116
SO THAT THE THE PAIR GROUND IS

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.117
IS IS.

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:20.553
IS EVEN AND THEN YOU TAKE CARE

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:21.654
OF THAT ISSUE IF IT'S AN ISSUE

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:23.723
AND THEN.

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:26.159
AND THEN THEN WE LOOK AT MAYBE A

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:27.293
BIGGER PLAN SAYING WHAT WE DO TO

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.962
THESE FAIRGROUNDS TO HELP THEM

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:29.529
OUT WITH THIS DEFERRED

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:31.731
MAINTENANCE.

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:35.001
SURE SO -- FIRST OF ALL THE THE

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:36.202
WITH REGARD VARYING ESTIMATES

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:37.070
FROM THE CAL PALACE FOR THE GUN

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:38.438
SHOW GENERATED ABOUT A

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:39.405
1-001-005-0000 DOLLARS A YEAR IN

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:41.274
REVENUE OUT OF A FOUR MILLION

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:43.643
DOLLAR -- BUDGET THAT THEY HAVE

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.478
SO IT'S A SMALL PORTION --

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:48.214
BECOME PALACES AND TOLD US

01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:49.983
BECAUSE THEY BONTA ME INTO

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:51.317
SOMEONE AND TING ASKING FOR I

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:52.252
THINK TEN OR TWENTY MILLION

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:54.087
DOLLARS TO FIX THE ROOF AND DO

01:54:54.153 --> 01:54:55.655
OTHER THINGS THIS IS IT'S A TINY

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:56.556
DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT TO BE

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:57.590
CLEAR.

01:54:57.657 --> 01:55:00.026
EVEN THOUGH THE GUN SHOW ISSUE

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:03.463
HAS DOMINATED THE THE NEWS AND

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:06.432
TERMS OF THE TONE DEAFNESS OF

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:09.235
THE CALIPARI LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:10.803
ONCE THAT'S BEEN THE HEADLINES.

01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:12.705
THE ISSUE RUNS MUCH DEEPER THAN

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:15.141
THAT AND THE LAND USE ISSUES ARE

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:18.144
ALSO -- A DEEP FRUSTRATION -- IN

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:19.746
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THESE ARE

01:55:19.812 --> 01:55:21.214
BOTH SIGNIFICANT ISSUES EVEN

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:26.019
THOUGH ONE IS GOT MORE PUBLIC

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.954
ATTENTION.

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:28.788
I GUESS WE COULD SOLVE THIS BY

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.023
JUST BUDGETING TWO HUNDRED

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:31.357
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:32.258
RIGHT THE AND THAT WOULD BE A

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.660
FOR THE GUN SHOW JUST THAT THAT

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:34.661
COMPONENT AND THE OTHER PART OF

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:35.561
IT SENATORS IT'S MORE OF A

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:36.562

IS.

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:38.531
BEING MANAGED AND SO THEREFORE

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:39.766
WE'RE GOING.

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:40.800
TO HAVE TO PUT A NEW OWNERSHIP

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:44.237

ABOUT THAT KIND OF APPROACH

01:55:52.945 --> 01:55:54.814
BECAUSE OF WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.149
TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND AND IT'S

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.483
LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO SETTLE.

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:58.618
A LOCAL PROBLEM HERE IN
