ON THE IN THE OPPOSITION'S-

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:08.226

ASUS- SUBMITTED WHICH SAYS THAT.

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:22.340
IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE THAT A

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.608
DEFENDANT CONVICTED OF A STRING

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:25.010

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.280
CRIME FOR WHICH HE OR SHE IS

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:30.816
CONVICTED AND MY QUESTION TO

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:33.518
THE AUTHOR IS. YOUR BILL DOES

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:36.388

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:48.633
CHOOSE. OKAY SO IT DOESN'T

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.637
NECESSARILY. BUT IT WELL THE MY

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:56.441
REAL POINT IS THAT IF. WHILE

00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:57.743
THE JUDGE MADE A SORT

00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:01.146
DISCRETION. THERE STILL COULD

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:06.084
BE OBVIOUSLY BUT D. M. THE MOST

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.886
SERIOUS OFFENSE COULD BE THAT

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:11.223
WHICH IS- SENSE UNDER IN ANY

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.724

TO SAY SENATOR I MEAN ASSEMBLY

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:50.295
MEMBER WORKS- THAT I REALLY

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:53.331
APPRECIATE THE BILL BECAUSE-

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:56.868
WHO. JUDICIAL DISCRETION I

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:57.903
THINK THERE WAS A PERIOD OF

00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.338
TIME WHERE IT WILL THERE WAS A

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:02.340
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE STATE.

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.342
PERHAPS GAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.311
JUDICIAL DISCRETION BUT THEN WE

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:09.014
KIND OF. LIKE IN THE PENDULUM

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.149
WE WENT FROM PERHAPS TOO MUCH

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:12.651
TO THEN. PRETTY MUCH

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.986
RESTRICTING NONE I THINK NOW

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:15.887
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:19.157
BALANCE. AND WHILE JUDGES ARE

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:21.126
LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE THEY'RE

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:24.262
NOT PERFECT. CERTAINLY THEY

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:27.632
ARE. THEY ARE IN EITHER ELECTED

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:28.934
OR APPOINTED TO THE BENCH WITH

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.636
THE- WITH PEOPLE'S INTENTION OR

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:32.404
THE POINTERS INTENTION THAT

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.073
THEY- ARE COMPETENT THAT THE

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.810
UNDERSTAND THE LAW. AND THAT IN

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:39.811
THOSE CASES WERE DAY. HAVE THE

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.613
ABILITY TO EXERCISE DISCRETION

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.381
THAT THEY WILL USE GOOD I

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.784
ALWAYS LOVE THIS WORD JUDGMENT

00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:48.453
IN DOING SO AND SO I THINK THAT

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.689
THERE IS A REAL VALUE BECAUSE

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.290
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN THE

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.625
PURPOSE OF TO MY POINT OF VIEW

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:56.328
A JURY TRIAL. IS THAT WE ARE

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.095
BRINGING IN A JURY OF THEIR

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:01.433
PEERS TO HAVE PEOPLE SSS

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.168
CIRCUMSTANCE AND USE THEIR OWN

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:05.971
JUDGMENT HOWEVER IN EVEN WITH

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:09.174
THE- WITH OUR JURY SYSTEM NOW

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:11.276
THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.211
THAT THE JUDGE MAY HAVE NO

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:15.747
CHOICE BUT TO SENSE THE CERTAIN

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:17.916
WAY AND THEN IN EFFECT WERE

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:20.218
ALMOST UNDERMINING THE WHOLE-

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:23.154
JURY PROCESS SO. I THINK THAT

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:24.623
THE BALANCE OF RESTORING

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.258
JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS A WISE

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:28.326
THING AT THIS POINT TO DO. I'M

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:31.763
SORRY PRESHEAF YOUR BILL AND GO

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.064
AHEAD SENATOR CORMANN ORDER.

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.699
SORRY I GOT CAUGHT UP I JUST

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:38.236
WANNA- ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.606
MADAM CHAIR- AND YOU KNOW THE

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.241
REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE A LOVE

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.809
HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH JUDICIAL

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.344
DISCRETION WE WANT JUDGES TO

00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:47.612
HAVE IT UNTIL WE DON'T LIKE

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.914
WHAT THEY DO AND THEN WE DON'T

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.582
WANT THEM TO HAVE IT. AND SO I

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:52.217
THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:56.421
TO GET OVER THAT SCHIZOPHRENIA-

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:58.290
AND ALLOW WE HAVE TO PUT OUR

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:00.458
FAITH TO WHAT GOVERNOR JERRY

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:01.459
BROWN TOLD US ON THE PENAL CODE

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.395
COMMITTEE. OUR REVISION

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:05.230
COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO PUT OUR

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:08.233
FAITH IN THE JUDGES. AND HAVE

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.001
FAITH THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:13.538
JOB. AND IF THEY CAN'T. THEN

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.707
YOU COME BACK AND SAY HOW CAN

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:17.108
WE HELP PROVIDE THEM GREATER

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:23.882
GUIDANCE. THEY ACTUALLY ON. THE

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.184
SIDE OF CONSERVATIVE SENTENCING

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.853
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.188
KNEE JERK REACTIONS THAT THE

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.424
LEGISLATURE HAS AND ALSO THE

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.192
PUBLIC. AND THE OTHER REALITY

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.094
IS THAT WHEN WE'RE COMING UP

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:36.895
WITH THESE LAWS AROUND

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:39.664
SENTENCING SAID THE YEARS ARE

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:42.033
REALLY ARBITRARY. THEY ARE

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.235
ARBITRARY AND THEN WE BUILD ON

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.537
THEM WITH ENHANCEMENTS AND

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:48.573
EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THE FOUND

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.343
AND YET THE FOUNDATION. THERE'S

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:53.511
NO ANALYSIS BEHIND THE

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.548
ORIGINAL- BASED SENTENCE TIME

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.550
AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO JUST

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.618
RECKON WITH THAT THAT'S HOW WE

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:03.121
HAVE HAD THIS EXPLOSIVE

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:06.257
METASTASIZE PRISON POPULATION

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:07.459
BECAUSE WE'RE PICKING NUMBERS

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:10.362
THAT SOUND RIGHT AND THERE'S NO

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:12.564
ONE ALICE'S BEHIND THEM. AND

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.966
THEN WE HAMSTRING JUDGES

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:18.303
ABILITY- TO USE THEIR BRAIN

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.372
WHICH IS WHY GENERALLY WHY

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:21.706
THEY'VE BEEN APPOINTED OR WE

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.974
VOTED FOR THEM BECAUSE WE

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.476
BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S IN THEIR

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.711
BRAIN IS OKAY. AND IT MAKES

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:29.347
COMPLETE SENSE TO OFFER RANGES

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:30.882
AND TO ALLOW JUDGES TO USE

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.717
DISCRETION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.285
IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.121
CHARGE AND BASED ON THE CRIME

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:38.823
IN BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.792
INSTEAD WE HAVE PROSECUTORS.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:45.030
WHO WANT TO JUST READ. SERCOMBE

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:46.664
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:48.700
NUANCES AND COMPLEXITIES TO A

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:50.668
CASE TO THESE ARBITRARILY

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.972
DECIDED. SENTENCING YEARS AND

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.540
THEN HOLD EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:56.741
TO THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:58.176
THE UNIVERSE THAT IS COMPLETELY

00:27:58.243 --> 00:27:59.511
BLACK AND WHITE EXCEPT THAT

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.812
SOMEBODY WILL BE BORN AND

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.014
SOMEBODY WILL DIE. THOSE ARE

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:03.515
THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:05.450
CONSTANT. SOURCE FOR ALL THOSE

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.318
REASONS THAT I DO SUPPORT THIS

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:08.887
AND I WANTED TO SHARE BUT I GOT

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.088
CAUGHT UP IN READING SOMETHING

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:11.556
ELSE AND SO THANK YOU FOR
