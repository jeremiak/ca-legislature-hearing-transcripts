FALL OFF THE PATH OF HIGH

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:30.689

KEY DIFFERENCES. IN MISSION. I

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:14.404
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.940
DIFFERENCE. SO MUCH AS A-

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.843
WILLINGNESS TO A LINE- SO WHEN

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.645
WE TALK ABOUT PATHWAYS WE NEED

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:23.814

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:34.124
FOR US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:38.028

THAT THERE'S- SO MUCH A

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:47.871
DIFFERENCE I THINK

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.907
FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE IN OUR

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:53.911

MY HEAD WHEN. THE DAY ARE TO.

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.065
TWO I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:16.433
PROGRAMS IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.901
DUPLICATION OF EFFORT BUT

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:18.869
THAT'S NOT I'M NOT GONNA ASK

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.204

YOU TO DESIRE TO. BUT I JUST

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:25.642
DID WHY DO WE DO TWO THINGS.

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:28.812
MUNIFICENT WHAT GOAL. IT IS NOT

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.013
HE'S DOING THE SAME THING. I

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.149
THINK THAT- I THINK ME COLLEGE

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:34.551
LEVEL ARE KERR TECHNICAL

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:36.453
EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.088
JOB TRAINING THAT REQUIRES POST

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.090
SECONDARY EDUCATION AND SO IF

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.158
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LINING A

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.327
PATHWAY. IF THEY STARTED THE K.

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:44.928
TWELVE SYSTEM THEY HAVE A PLACE

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:46.129
TO GO. AND THE FOR WORKING

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.664
TOGETHER IT'S A SEAMLESS

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:50.234
TRANSITION AS OPPOSED TO NOW

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:50.867
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO DOES

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:53.604
THIS TO- SO. IT'S NOT DOING THE

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.772
SAME THING. IT'S IMPROVING THE

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:57.975
OUTCOMES AND HOPEFULLY MOVING

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.210
STUDENTS THROUGH THEIR JOURNEY.

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.979
IN A MORE SEAMLESS WAY. CAN I

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.547
JUST. AS A PARENT TEACHER I

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:05.582
JUST TO GIVE SOMETIME CITY IS

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.384

SEVENTH GRADE. RIGHT AND- I'M

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:15.058
NOT THERE HEY AND I DON'T THINK

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.927
WE SHOULD BE THERE. I THINK CT

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:18.228
PROGRAM SHOULD NOT ONLY BE TO

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.197

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:23.700
A CREW BUT ALSO ENGAGES KIDS

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.102
KEEP SEVEN SCHOOL SO I THINK WE

00:48:25.168 --> 00:48:26.970
NEED TO. KEEP THAT IN MIND TO

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:30.374
IN THE IN THE SKILLS YOU LEARN.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.276
IN A C. T. PROGRAM BE THEY YOU

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.011
KNOW MIDDLE SCHOOL ON UP. YOU

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:37.214
CAN THEN USE LATER ON IN LIFE.

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.549
I MEAN I. DIDN'T DO WELL OF MY

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:40.917
FRACTIONS UNTIL SOMEONE HANDED

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.252
ME A PIECE OF WOOD AND SAID CUT

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.887
THAT A FIVE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS.

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:44.688
RIGHT THAT'S WHEN I REALLY

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:45.756
LEARNED THAT'S WHEN I AND I

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:46.923
COULD APPLY IT LATER ON IN

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.725
LIFE- I JUST THINK THAT'S

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:49.493
SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO BE

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:50.794
MINDFUL OF IT ON THE WE SHOULD

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:51.728
GET TOO CAUGHT I'M NOT SAYING

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.230
YOUR- WE SHOULD GET TOO CAUGHT

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:56.199
pPROGRAMS HAVE TO BE ALIGNED

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.200
WITH HIGH SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.335
HIGH SCHOOL MY NOT EVEN OFFER.

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.003
A CERTAIN TYPE OF PROGRAM

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.938
CORRECT. HE WON'T COMMENT ON

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.407
THAT OR NOT. YES I THINK IT

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:04.841
GOES BOTH WAYS I THINK THERE

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:07.778
ARE- HIGH SCHOOL. AS THEY DON'T

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:11.348
OFFER. A ROBUST- PROGRAMS. AT

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.016
INCREASE TECHNICAL AGES AS WELL

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.051
AS THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:15.052
THAT DON'T AND I THINK THIS IS

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.721
OUR OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE. A

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.423
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND BETTER

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:20.691
ALIGNMENT FOR THAT. FOR THAT.

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:22.926
SPECIFIC REASON THAT. IN SOME

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.461
CASES THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:25.562
GET IT AT. AT THE HIGH SCHOOL

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.963
LEVEL THEY GET AT THE COMMUNITY%

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.132
COLLEGE LEVEL. OR THERE. WILL

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.167
HAVE IT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:31.635
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.937
CONTINUE THEIR PATHWAY- AND IT

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:35.105
MAY NOT BE WITH THEIR LOCAL

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.440
COMMUNITY COLLEGE- BUT WE

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.141
HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD JOB. OF

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:39.810
ALIGNING. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:42.079
WHERE THIS. THIS IS HELPFUL TO

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:45.982
THAT EFFORT. ONE OF THE KEEP.

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.184
WE'VE SEEN IT'S REALLY NOT A

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.285
DIFFERENCE IS MAYBE I WOULD

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.120
MEET MEANT ADMINISTER BUT MOST.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:51.822
IN NINETEEN NINETY WE HAD THREE

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.656
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.825
REQUESTS FOR THE ONE FIFTY.

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:56.226
THIS YEAR IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:58.028
HAVE NINE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.364
DOLLAR REQUEST. ARE PRO SAME

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.699
AMOUNT OF APPLICANTS. SO THEY

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:03.900
WANT TO GROW THEIR PROGRAMS

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.202
CORRECT EITHER KEY DIFFERENCES

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.703
IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HEY

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:07.838
JUST HAVEN'T HAD. TECHNICAL

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.373
ASSISTANCE LAST COUPLE YEARS

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.173
AND THEY WERE USED TO PRO

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.274
GETTING PROVIDE TECHNICAL

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.477
ASSISTANCE FROM A COUNTY OFFICE

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:14.411
OF EDUCATION SO I KNOW THAT.

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:15.712
YOU KNOW THAT'S ON THAT'S

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.114
HAPPENING IN IT WILL KERR BUT-

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.282
THAT IS ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE-

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.784
THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.185
COUPLE OF YEARS I JUST HAVEN'T.

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.653
BENEFITTED FROM FROM THAT

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.055
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THAT

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.723

COLLEGE PREP BUT C. T. ISN'T

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.210
COLLEGE PREP RIGHT. IT MIGHT

00:50:47.277 --> 00:50:48.779

OBVIOUSLY AND HOW THIS HOW THIS

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.466
ALLOCATION IS BEING DONE AT

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:44.634
LEAST PROPOSE FOR THIS YEAR HAS

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.236
SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.571
ESPECIALLY ON WHAT I GUESS WHAT

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:51.575
WE LABEL SMALL LARGE SCHOOL

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:52.776
DISTRICTS NEO SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.811
IN. AND MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:57.347
I'M NAING HAVE SOME VERY. LONG

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.816
LONG TERM EFFECTIVE C. T.

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.719
PROGRAMS- BUT LIKE COLUSA

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.955
UNIFIED. YOU KNOW THERE SEEN A

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:07.257
LOSS OF TWO NINETY FOUR

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.291
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 83%

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:12.162
DECREASE. UNDER THIS PROPOSED-

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:15.131
ALLOCATION AROUND FIVE-

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:19.769
CORNING. YEAH UNION HIGH SCHOOL

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:20.470
NINETY TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:25.108
68% DECREASE WEAKLAND UNION

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:30.180
HIGH SCHOOL. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY

THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX.

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:42.058
DOLLARS A 75% DECREASE AN EMMY

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.895
AND THESE ARE NOT. LARGE

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:47.797
SCHOOLS- BUT THEY FALL INTO

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:49.099
THAT CATEGORY IN THE WAY THAT

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.268
THIS IS GAME ALLOCATED BUT THEY

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:53.436
DO AL EVERY ONE OF THOSE

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:56.806
DOLLARS MATTERS- AND ESPECIALLY

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.542
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ARE PRETTY

00:52:58.608 --> 00:52:59.543
YOU KNOW AND I THINK THE IDEA

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.811
IS SAY WE WANT TO. THIS TO

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.913
PROVE IN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.549
SHOWN EFFECTIVENESS AND- AND

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:08.351
WE'VE SEEN THIS IN IN AND ALL

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:10.620
THESE ONES THAT I'VE NAMED. AND

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.856
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.725
FUNDING FORMULA. NOW BEEN

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:18.094
APPROVED AT THE NEXT BOARD

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:20.297
MEETING- SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:22.299
SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT AND

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:23.233
THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.001
LIKE TO SEE COULD WE PUT IN

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:28.004
FRONT OF THE BOARD. IN THE

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:29.873
DIFFERENT HOW THAT DIFFERENCE

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.841
JOIN THE TWO WAYS TO ALLOCATE

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.343
AND WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE IS

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.644
BECAUSE I THINK THE BOARD

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.580
SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:39.282
THIS COULD MEAN TO EFFECTIVE-

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.618
CT PROGRAMS IN THE STATE IF WE

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:44.254
GO FORWARD GOOD. THANK YOU FOR

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:45.922
ASKING A QUESTION. EDIBLE

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.223
IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.392
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NAY EIGHTEEN

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.026
NINETEEN SOME OF THESE SMALLER

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:53.663
SCHOOL DISTRICTS- BETWEEN

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.799
500-518-8211 HUNDRED SAW OF 76%

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.968
A 100% ME THERE'S A HUGE

00:53:58.034 --> 00:54:00.136
INCREASES WHICH WERE REALLY AN

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.705
ANOMALY BECAUSE IN PRIOR YEARS

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.807
BY USING THE VERY FORMULA THEY

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:05.575
WERE RECEIVING OBVIOUSLY LESS

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.010
THAT AMOUNT SO IN EIGHTEEN

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.244
NINETEEN CLEARLY. I WAS HEARING

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.679
WHICH THEY GOT SAW A BOOST THEY

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:12.482
BENEFITTED FROM THAT- AND IN

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:13.583
NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVEDECIDED

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.418
TO GO BACK TO AND HEARING THE

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:18.922
STATUTE WE AGREE WITH YOU- WE

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.991
WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:22.325
LEGISLATURE ON. AMENDING OR AT

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.828
THE CURRENT FORMULA IN STATUTE

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:27.864
TO ENSURE THAT- THE ALLOCATION

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:28.932
OF THIS FORMULA IS MORE

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.800
EQUITABLE BY EIGHTY EIGHT IN

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:33.536
THE PROVIDING A BOOST PERHAPS

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:34.571
TO THE SMALLER AND SMALLER

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:36.206
MEDIUM SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.607
THEY HAVE A VIABLE VIABLE

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:40.076
PROGRAM WE ABSOLUTELY SERVE

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.144
AGREE WITH YOU THE MATCH IS

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.312
ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE SMALL

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.447
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE TWO TO ONE

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:47.617
MATCH- IT'S- RIGHT NOW IT'S FOR

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.887
ALL THREE- COHORTS OF. OF SIZES

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.856
THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE SAME

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:53.657
MATCH AND THAT COULD BE A

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:54.724
PROBLEM I'M SURE TO HEAR ABOUT

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.292
IT TODAY I'M SO WE'RE HAPPY

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.661
TALK TO YOU AND WE'RE ALL

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.129
PROVIDE THE STATE BOARD WITH

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.331
THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN THE

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:03.700
PRIOR YEARS AND WHAT THAT

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:06.069
DIFFERENCE IT IS- SO THAT THEY

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:13.543
HAVE FULL INFORMATION. WE

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.011
ABSOLUTELY WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.713
GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT OKAY

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.181
JUST ABOUT JUST SOME DATA RUNS

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.683
THAT SHOW THE DIFFERENT

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:22.385
METHODOLOGIES AND HOW THAT GETS

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:25.522
COMPLETED. AND. I GUESS MY

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.524
OTHER QUESTION IS RIGHT NOW HOW

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:32.028
DO WE- HOW TO SEE THE DEFINE

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.630
RURAL FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THE

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.331
PURPOSES OF POSITIVE-

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:38.501
CONSIDERATION IN THE STATUTE.

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:42.205
WELL GREENS STAND TO- IT'S

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:46.443
DEFINED FOR US- AND I'VE WE

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:47.877
BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.446
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T HERE WHEN

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.247
THAT PLACE AND MAYBE SOME YOU

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:53.650
WERE BORN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:57.520
CATEGORIES A HUNDRED FORTY ONE

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:58.588
HUNDRED FORTY BELOW AND FIVE

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.123
HUNDRED FIFTY ONE AND ABOVE.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.393
THOSE WERE PERHAPS IT WAS IT

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.529
WAS IT WAS. I THOUGHT THAT THIS

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:08.264
WAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SCHOOL

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.567
SIZE AND NOT ABA SIZE WE'RE NOT

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:13.169
SURE- BECAUSE THEY'RE AWFULLY

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:17.741
SMALL- IT TOOK TO THEM SMALLMEDIUM AND LARGE BECAUSE EVEN A

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:20.043
SCHOOL- DISTRICTS AT ELEVEN

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.278
HUNDRED IS REALLY SMALL. AND SO

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:23.947
WE THINK THAT PERHAPS THE

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:27.150
INTENTION- WAS FORCED SIZE OF

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.152
SCHOOL AND NOT DISTRICTS SO

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.920
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.822
SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT BUT

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.090
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:35.658
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.127
WHEN AND ADMINISTERING THE

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:39.162
GRANT JUST WE LOOK AT THE

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.131
STATUE NOT THE STATUTE SAYS.

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:43.399
RIGHT SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:44.434
THAT MAYBE WE COULD BE LOOKING

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.735
AT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:49.305
STATUTE- AND ALLOCATION. HOW

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:50.907
HOW THE- HOW THE STATUTE

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.909
DIRECTS YOU TO ALLOCATE EXACTLY

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:56.646
AND WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. ON

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:58.448
HOW TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE.

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:01.684
OKAY AND THEN JUST FOLLOWING ON

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.921
THE CHAIRMAN'S. LANA QUESTION I

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.156
MEAN I THINK IT DOES BEG THE

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:09.793
QUESTION. OF YOU KNOW WHY DO WE

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:10.460
HAVE KIND OF THESE TWO

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.095
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND I SEE

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:13.763
THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.267
PLAY A ROLE IN ALL THIS BUT-

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:18.768
YOU KNOW BUT I. C. C. T. IS

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:20.937
SORT OF. YOU KNOW AT LEAST

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.138
TRADITIONALLY AND I THINK WHAT

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:23.473
WE'VE SEEN IS REALLY BEEN IN

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.875
THAT CASE YOU TWELVE. SYSTEM OF

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.377
PROVIDING THESE DIFFERENT

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.112
COURSES THAT THAT DON'T

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:30.380
NECESSARILY SET YOU ON A PATH

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.815
IN SEVENTH GRADE I AGREE WITH

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.316
THE CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE-

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:35.218
YOU WILL KIDS WANT TO BE EX WE

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:35.718
WANT TO EXPOSE THEM TO

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.654
DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THERE MAY

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.955
BE SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:41.324
TAKE TO AND HELPS THEM LEARN

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:45.328
BETTER. AND SO. I MEAN JUST A

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:47.096
QUICK QUESTION ON THIS IS ANY

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.932
POTENTIALLY COULD AN ALLEY A

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.967
GET FUNDED OVER UNDER BOTH

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:55.171
PROGRAMS. IS THAT RIGHT- DATED

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.974
THE K. FOURTEEN- THE K. TWELVE

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.108
STRONG WORKFORCE AND GOES TO

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.978
THE LA. SO THEY GET SEE TAKE

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.113
FUNDS AND THEN THEY GET THE

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.615
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SO IT

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.050
IS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.518
PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE WAY SEE

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:09.986
TAKE AND THEY HAVE TO APPLY

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:11.521
THROUGH BOTH TO BOTH YOUR

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.489
PROGRAM YEAH AND THE CVS AND

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:16.125
THE INTENT IS TO LEVERAGE.

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.561
THOSE FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.230
THE FOCUS REMAINS ON THE

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:21.898
STUDENT RIGHTS SO WE ARE

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:24.167
FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:25.435
HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED THOSE

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.170
PATHWAYS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHEN

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:29.906
THEY FINISH THEIR K. TWELVE

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.241
EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY GO NEXT.

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:34.744
RIGHT I JUST I MEAN IT IS FOR

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:37.647
ME LIKE LOOKING AT IT. AT A TEN

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.649
THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL I KIND OF

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:40.149
SAY WELL WHY WE HAVE TWO

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:44.287
DIFFERENT. YEAH GRANTS. I

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.788
REALLY LIKE I MEAN IT JUST

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.923
SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE MAY

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:50.026
RUN THIS UNDER ONE PROGRAM- AND

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.394
SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THIS

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.262
AND CERTAINLY THE COMMUNITY

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.697
COLLEGES IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:55.765
ARE ALSO CONTINUING THAT

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.433
EDUCATION THE TECHNICAL

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.168
EDUCATION ARE CRITICAL AS

NEW TRAINING TO GO INTO

00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:07.343
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I THINK

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.344
THAT'S SOMETHING MORE SPUR

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.846
TENSELY LOOKING INTO AND OF THE

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.949

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.318
OF THAT SO ANYWAYS WILL. I

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.486

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:34.237
KNOW WHY YES- WE EX THAT WE

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:36.406
ANTICIPATE IT'S BECAUSE WE CAP

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:40.176
TO THE AMOUNT. OF AN AWARD

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.512
COULD BE TWO TWO MILLION. AS

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:45.381
WELL AS WE- WE MADE IT SO THAT

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.582
THEY HAD TO PARTNER WITH A

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:49.652
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO- WE ARE.

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.020
IN A SENSE ENSURING THE

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:52.889
COLLABORATION IS HAPPENING SO

YOUR PARTNER AND IN THE FIRST.

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:01.064
ROUND THEY DID NOT. SO IF WE'RE

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.633
GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE COMPLY

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.133
WITH THE INTENT OF THE

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.102
LEGISLATION WE REALLY NEED TO

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.770
MAKE SURE THAT. THEY ARE

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.439
PARTNERING TOGETHER TO BUILD

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:10.473
THOSE DIFFERENT THOSE PATHWAYS

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.076
SO. WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHY- IT

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.877
LIMITED BECAUSE YOU HAD TO HAVE

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.280

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.977
THE K. FOURTEEN TAPS OUR HOUSE

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.445

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.725
MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL MEETING

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:30.525
HAVING TO DO WITH THE

INDUSTRY SECTORS SO AN EXAMPLE

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.108
THAT I SHARED IS THAT ONE OF

BECOMES A PROBLEM AND AGAIN

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:36.558
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WHERE-

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.460

CLOSE- AND SO WE AS MUCH AS WE-

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:20.669
STRUGGLE WITH THOSE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:22.137
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THE

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.473
COLLABORATION PIECE IS THERE.

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:25.374
BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.542
ARE A HUGE IMPEDIMENT- AS

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.877
REPRESENTATIVE FOR ACCESS TO

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.579
AND HAVING RECEIVED A LOT OF

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.547
FEEDBACK FROM THE FIELD. IT

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:34.082
BECOMES MUCH WORSE WHEN THERE

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.317
IS NOT THAT SPIRIT OF

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.885
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.854
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT THE

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.555
K. TWELVE DISTRICTS AND- THERE

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:43.225
HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY- NEGATIVE

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.060
A- EXPERIENCES THAT. HAVE

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.329
OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THAT AS

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.664
WELL AND I DID MENTION WHERE

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:50.699
THERE SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.968
WITH A- MISUNDERSTANDING AROUND

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.636
THE FUNDING WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.837
IS IT K. TWELVE FUNDING IF IT'S

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:56.705
K. TWELVE FUNDING WISE

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:57.672
ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.608
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS THERE FOR

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.076
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MUST BE

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:04.613
ABLE TO ACCESS FOR. IT'S QUITE

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:11.620
FOR I TO THE. SO MY- MAYBE FOR

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:14.089
ME CARRIER. OR OR GOOD DOCTOR

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:14.756
ARE YOU MAY THE CHIU WERE WITH

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.525
YOUR TO COLLEGE IN THAT. THE

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:17.492
REASON YOU CAN OUR WITH ONE

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:18.093
MAYBE AND COULD YOU ELABORATE

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:18.693
ON THAT I WOULD IMAGINE EVEN

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.728
YOU AREA THAT PROBLEM AND I

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.529
DON'T HAVE MY AREA PROBABLY

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:21.763
WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES MY

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.899
HOUSE. I CAN ACCESS PROBABLY

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:24.599
FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.334
DISTRICTS RIGHT GROW WITHIN

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:26.868
TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF MY

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.204
HOUSE. LONG BEACH RIGHT BUT IN

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.907
YOUR AREA I IMAGINE SOME OF

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:32.507
THOSE COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:34.276
MIGHT HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.777
PROGRAM PROBABLY. A MUCH

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.112
FURTHER DISTANCE COULD YOU

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.181
ELABORATE ON. THE ANY THE

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.382
COMMUNICATION RELATIONSHIP

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.683
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YOU

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:42.517
MIGHT WANT TO BE THIS ONE YOU

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:43.852
MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY WANT TO

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.120
BE AT THE ONE NEXT DOOR.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.221
BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:49.257
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM UC AS

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.626
NECESSARY. AB SO THE EXAMPLE I

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:54.663
GAVE WS OUR WELDING. WELDING

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.665
IS ON THEIR CATALOG IN OUR

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.400
LOCAL COMMUNICATIVE STRICT AND

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.102
A WEEK WE ALSO A PHENOMENAL

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.770
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND BUT

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.105
ONE THING SEEMS TO BE A

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:06.575
STICKING POINT- THEY- THEY

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:08.844
UTILIZE A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.012
WHICH GOT SHUT DOWN BY OSHA.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.415
AND SO WE COULDN'T WE DIDN'T

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:14.683
THEY DIDN'T AND THEN OFFERED IN

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:17.719
THE LAST YEAR- AND SO WHAT WE

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.521
WANTED TO DO WAS BE ABLE TO DO

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.323
ON ROLE WITH ANOTHER COMMITTEE

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.458
COLLEGE BOTH ME COLLEGES WITHIN

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.293
THIRTY MILES- IF YOU GO NORTH

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.431
YOU GO SOUTH- AND SO A LOT OF

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.032
ARE. A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS WANT

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.868
TO GO TO THE SOUTH TO COLLEGE

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.737
TO THE SECOND COLLEGE. AND

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:38.874
WE'VE TALKED TO THAT THE-

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.109
CHANCELLORS OF THE COLLEGES AND

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:43.211
PRESIDENT AND- ONE WON'T

RELEASE US TO BE ABLE TO DO ON

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.617
ALL WITH THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:49.885
INTERESTED FOR THAT PARTICULAR

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.720
PROGRAM ANY RATE THE OTHER

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.622
CHALLENGES THEY HAVE MAYBE WE

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:56.458
HAVE TWELVE PATHWAYS IN A NINE

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.927
INDUSTRY SECTORS THE ONLY LINE

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:01.029
WITH THREE OF OURS. EDITED

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.597
TOGETHER TO GET BACK TO MY

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:05.700
POINT EARLIER WHICH WAS. IS IT

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:06.268
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO A LINE OF

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:06.835
THEM ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.470
OPERATE HERE. RIGHT IT SEEMS

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:11.206
LIKE. YOU MIGHT BE HEADING THAT

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.307
THEY MIGHT BE STUCK IN THEIR

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:14.476
WAYS AND RIGHT IT'S YOUR JOB.

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.811
TO MODIFY IT WELL ONE OF THE

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:17.612
ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:20.115
THEY MADE FOR- TAKING OUR

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.850
BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.319
CONSTRUCTION PATHWAY. WAS TOO

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.521
THEY HAVE A GREAT SET UP WITH A

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.323
WITH FOR YEARS UNIVERSITY

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.691
THROUGH THEIR BUSINESS PROGRAM.

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.326
SO THEY WERE GONNA TAKE THEY

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:32.160
WANT TO TAKE OUR CONSTRUCTION

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:34.529
STUDENTS PUT HIM INTO THE-

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.431
BUSINESS PROGRAM. AND THEN THAT

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:36.865
WILL GET HIM INTO A

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.733
CONSTRUCTION- MANAGEMENT

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.602
PROGRAM METAPHOR UNIVERSITY.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.004
AND THERE'S NO CONSTRUCTION

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:45.340
MANAGEMENT AT ALL ON THE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:49.644
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAMPUS SO IT

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:50.145
LITERALLY STOPS THEIR CD

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:53.949
TRAINING SO WHERE'S. THE UNION

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.083
STRUCTURE MANAGER IS VERY

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.551
DIFFERENT THAN CORRECT WANTING

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.086
TO BE A FRAMER FOR PRESS.

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:59.654
CORRECT WHERE THEY CAN GO UNDER

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.590
THE UNION AND HAVE THE UNION

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.325
COULD THEN EVENTUALLY PAY FOR

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.126
THEIR A AND THEIR THEIR-

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:07.929
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND IF THEY

WANTED TO. CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.399
SO TO FURTHER EXPAND ON THAT-

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.801
CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:15.070

THE TIME AND BASICALLY THE ONLY

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.720
DIFFERENCE IN THE NINE.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:55.390
DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS THAT I

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:56.591
MADE LAST YEAR WAS THE INDUSTRY

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:59.127
SECTOR BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:00.628
EIGHTY EIGHT THE SAME MATCH THE

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.664
SAME STUDENTS THE SAME NUMBERS

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.766
SO OR SIMILAR NUMBERS MMHM SO

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.668
THAT WAS FRUSTRATING AS WELL

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.937
OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:11.673
LIKE TO SHARE BEFORE WE- BRING

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:12.841
UP THE NEXT PANEL I THINK THAT

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.976
ONE JUST ONE PIECE- THERE WAS

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:17.045
KIND OF IT WAS ALLUDED TO AND I

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.079
CAN'T MEMBER BY WHOM AND THE

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.682
PREVIOUS PANEL. THAT SEE TAKEN

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.116
STRONG WORK FORCE ARE BOTH

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:25.720
COMPETITIVE FUNDING. AND I WANT

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.721
TO DISABUSE ANYONE OF THAT HER

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.990
STANDING BECAUSE THE CITY

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:32.393
INCENTIVE GRANTS. DOES FOLLOW

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.428
EIGHTY EIGHT IT DOES LOOK AT

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.463
EQUITY CONCERNS AND IT DOES

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.498
LOOK OUT FROM A PLANNING

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:39.133
PERSPECTIVE HOW YOU MEASURE HOW

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.503
YOU REFLECT ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:42.003
YOUR GROWTH IN YOUR OWN

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:45.039
PROGRAMS. HOWEVER AND I

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.174
UNDERSTAND IT'S RATED AND SO

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.409
FORTH HOWEVER AS A AS DISTRICTS

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:50.044
RESOLUTELY ETS WE HAVE A

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.513
GENERAL IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:52.747
GOING TO BE FROM A FUNDING

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:55.049
PERSPECTIVE. YEAR TO YEAR WHICH

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.484
REALLY SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.486
PLAN EFFECTIVELY BUILD OUR

01:25:58.553 --> 01:25:59.687
PROGRAMS EFFECTIVELY AND MORE

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.823
IMPORTANTLY SUSTAIN THEM-

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.425
STRONG WORK FORCE COULD BE ZERO

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.827
COULD BE TWO MILLION COULD BE

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:06.427
SIX THOUSAND COULD BE WORKING

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:07.829
OUT IN THE TAIL ON THE- THING.

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:10.498
SO THAT IS A THAT IS NOT THE

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.467
SAME THING AND I WANT TO BE

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.502
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THANK

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.403

PROPOSED FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:28.116
THIS YEAR THE METHODOLOGY AND-

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.150
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:30.585
MIGHT BE ON HOW HOW THAT

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:32.954
DIFFERENCE IMPACTS SEE TAKE. IN

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:38.026
PARTICULAR. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.928
THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE WANT

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.930
IT'S A AT THE- ONE OF OUR

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:42.597
DISTRICT KIND OF UNDERSTANDINGS

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.165
IS THAT. IN ORDER FOR THE

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:46.968
FUNDING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND-

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.970
AND WE WANTED TO BE ON GOING IN

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:49.771
ORDER FOR US TO BE IN

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.272
SUSTAINABLE WE DO NOT PUT ANY

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:54.842
PERSONNEL INTO OUR GRANTS- SO

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.277
WE BUILD PROGRAMS AND THEN HIRE

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.712
THE DISTRICT WILL PAY FOR THAT

01:26:57.779 --> 01:27:01.115
PERSONNEL AS WE NEED IT- AND

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:05.787
SO. FIRST SEE TAKE. WE'RE WE'RE

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.755
UTILIZING THE FUNDS TO BETTER

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.924
OUR PROGRAMS. I AND- WE WORK

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.225
WAIT OUR INITIAL WHEN OUR

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.861
INITIAL GRANT WE HAD A BOND TO

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:14.696
MATCH SO WE ACTUALLY GOT

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.764
CONSIDERABLY MORE. WE HAD A

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.933
LITTLE BIT LESS THIS YEAR BUT

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.901
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THERE'S NINE

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.769
HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLARS BEING

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.605
ASKED FOR IT HAS TO BE DIVVIED

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.940
UP SOMEONE. BUT IN ORDER FOR TO

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.775
BE SUSTAINABLE IT HAS TO ALSO

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:30.812
BE RELIABLE BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.413
IT'S EVEN IF IT'S A EVEN AS WE

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.414
ARE SUPPLEMENTING NOT

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.149
SUPPLANTING WE STILL NEED TO BE

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.818
ABLE TO HAVE THAT FUNDING TO.

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.553
CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMS AT THAT

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.455
LEVEL THAT WE'VE BEEN. THAT

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:43.257
WE'VE BEEN SERVING OUR STUDENTS.

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:47.462
YEAH I THINK SO TO PERSPECTIVES

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:49.564
AGAIN DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE WE

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:52.100
HAVE A VERY SIMILAR MODEL THE

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:54.736
MAJORITY OF OUR- OF OUR

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:57.672
OVERHEAD IS IN GENERAL FUND AND

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.407
THIS SEE TAKE FUNDS IN TO HELP

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.576
US TO SUPPLEMENT TO ONE OF THE

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:03.077
THINGS I DID HAVE TO HIRE USING

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.812
SEE TAKE QUITE FRANKLY WAS A

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.948
DATA TECHNICIAN. AND YOU CAN

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.218
KIND OF SEE WHY- BUT OVER ALL

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:11.452
WE SUSTAIN OURSELVES AND THAT

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:12.887
IS OUR MATCH THAT'S HOW WE'RE

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:15.223
ABLE TO- RECEIVE THE C. TAKE

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:17.492
FUNDING WITH THE TWO TO ONE

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:18.393
REQUIREMENT AT THE LEVEL THAT

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.595
WE- RECEIVE IT OUT IS BECAUSE

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.397
WE DO HAVE THAT PRETTY

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.500
SIGNIFICANT MATCH ON OUR END- I

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:26.534
WOULD. SHARE WITH YOU THAT I

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.503
THINK. I AND I COULD BE

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:29.570
SPEAKING OUT OF TURN HERE BUT I

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.472
THINK THAT WE ARE IN SOME WAYS

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:34.375
AN ANOMALY AS I SPEAK TO OTHERS

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.944
SEE TV COUNCIL MEMBERS- THROUGH

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.579
ACTS THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:41.082
DISTRICTS THAT REALLY SURVIVE

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.283
AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.652
TEACHERS ARE FUNDED OUT OF. THE

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.487
CITY INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDING

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:47.555
OUT OF STRONG WORK FORCE AND

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:50.692
SO- I'M- THAT'S WHERE THE

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.860
COMMENT CAME FROM- WITH REGARDS

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:54.629
TO THEIR FEAR THAT THEIR

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.330
PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY COLLAPSE.

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:57.799
YEAH AND I THINK JUST ALLEN IN

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:59.801
MY COLLEAGUES. ARE VERY CORRECT

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:02.036
IN IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.938
THROUGH OUR GENERAL FUND SO.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.206
THAT WE MAY TO CONDEMN WITH OUR

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:07.108
BOARD OF TRUSTEES- IT'S A

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.043
PATHWAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:10.311
FOR US AS FAR AS GRADUATION IS

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:11.312
CONCERNED SO WE'RE FINDING

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.448
EVERYONE OF OUR ELEVEN. FULL

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.483
TIME TEACHERS OUT OF OUR

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:16.484
GENERAL FUND WHICH ALSO HAS A

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.585
COMPETING INTERESTS WITH

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.253
SPECIAL EDUCATION STIRS AND

OVER SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD.

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.376
IT'S ALSO CHALLENGING TO MAKE A

PROBLEMATIC FOR K. TWELVE DALY

01:42:50.197 --> 01:42:51.632
ACE. AND THE FACT THAT EACH

REGION OPERATES A LITTLE

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:53.734
DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHERS

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.868
CAUSES CONFUSION AND

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.236
FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE

UNCOMMON TO HEAR THAT SOMETHING

NOT THE SAME INFORMATION THAT

AND AS WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.752
MAY BE DUE TO THE NEW LIMITS ON

THEIR OWN. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:26.286
THAT SUPERINTENDENT GRANGER

CHANGES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.887
THIS IS NOT A FUNDING STRUCTURE

FLUCTUATING FUNDING AWARDS

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:48.902

THE PROCESS- SOME OF THE

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.643
EXAMPLES OF THIS ROUND OUR-

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:55.715

DISTRICT THAT'S SUPPLIED YOU

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:14.801
INTERPRETED THOSE TWO COLUMNS

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:17.037
DIFFERENTLY THAT HERE'S WHAT

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:18.204

THE COLLEGE CITED IS AN

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.281
ALLOCATION BASED ON THEIR

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.549
ENROLLMENT IN THEIR DISTRICTS

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:03.917

FORCE PROGRAM WORKS ON THEIR

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:09.556

US. SO THERE WAS A COMMENT. NO

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:13.526
THE PORTION OF COMMERCE WHERE

COUNTY OUR OWN AND I WANT TO.

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:15.307
THE LIKE MY SISTER IN FRESNO

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:18.744
COUNTY HAS ALSO SAID ABOUT- THE

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:19.912
LITTLE GUYS TO BECAUSE THAT'S

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:22.114
WHO I REPRESENT TO IS THE SMALL

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:24.283
SCHOOL RULES SCHOOLS. WHO

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:26.318
CANNOT BE STRETCHED ANY THINNER

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:28.120
AND IT'S WITH MATCH THE MATCH

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:30.022
THAT THEY USE FOR C. TAKE THEY

02:10:30.088 --> 02:10:31.490
HAVE NO MATCH AVAILABLE FOR K.

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.458

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:36.929
AND IN DOING THAT ANOTHER

02:10:36.995 --> 02:10:38.430
REASON WE HAVE TO DO THAT FOR

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:40.265
THEM IS THE SMALL SCHOOLS

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:42.834

CAN'T DO ANOTHER GRANT SO

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:56.348

USE RELATIVE TO. THE OUTCOMES

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:48.500
OF THE GRANT SO THOSE ARE ALL

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:50.302
IMPORTANT. AND I THINK ONE OF

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:53.171

TWO STREAMS OF FUNDING THAT.

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:57.576
FOR THE MOST PART SEEM TO DO.

PARTICIPATED IN AND I THINK

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:14.793
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TODAY IS

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:15.327
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:17.629
