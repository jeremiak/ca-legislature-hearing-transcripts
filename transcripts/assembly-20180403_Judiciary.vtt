00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:27.559 region:rollup2
THIS AT ALL. THE IDEA BEHIND

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:28.694 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE IS THAT SIMPLY THAT

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:31.563 region:rollup2
ANIMALS ARE A SPECIAL TYPE OF

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:32.364 region:rollup2

INTO A DECIDING WHERE PET GOES

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:42.741 region:rollup2
IN DIVORCE IT'S AS CLEAR

00:30:40.906 --> 00:30:44.543 region:rollup2

THAT AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:52.818 region:rollup2
SEEKS TO REMEDY.

IF YOU ARE IF EITHER PARTY IS

BRINGS WOULD BRING A MOTION TO

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:10.842 region:rollup2
REQUESTED THE COURT WOULD HAVE

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:12.077 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTION TO ISSUE AN

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:13.078 region:rollup2
INTERIM ORDER JUST AS IT WOULD

00:35:12.077 --> 00:35:14.512 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN.

00:35:13.078 --> 00:35:16.781 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTION TO ISSUE AN

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:18.550 region:rollup2
INTERIM ORDER ON ANY OTHER PIECE

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:20.652 region:rollup2
OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WHAT

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.754 region:rollup2
USUALLY HAPPENS IN ALL HONESTY

00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:24.389 region:rollup2
IS IF ONE PERSON WHO IS MORE

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:26.024 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED ARE ALIGNED WITH THE

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:27.892 region:rollup2
PAT. EITHER REMAINS IN THE

00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:30.095 region:rollup2
FAMILY RESIDENCE OR LEAVES THAT

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:31.696 region:rollup2
PERSON USUALLY TAKES THE PAT

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:33.732 region:rollup2
WITH HIM. AND AGAIN IN ALL

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:35.500 region:rollup2
HONESTY NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:37.168 region:rollup2
WHOEVER HAS CUSTODY OF THE

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.404 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE PRIMARY CUSTODY

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:40.605 region:rollup2
USUALLY HAS THE PACKED WITH THEM

00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:42.640 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY ALIGNED

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:45.243 region:rollup2
WITH THE CHILD. AND I WOULD JUST

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.044 region:rollup2
ADD THAT. THIS BILL WOULDN'T

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.544 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:48.646 region:rollup2
THAT BUT WHEN THERE IS A

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:50.281 region:rollup2
DISPUTE.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:52.217 region:rollup2
IT GIVES THE CRITERIA CARRIED

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.885 region:rollup2
THE ANIMAL. AND THE PROBLEM WE

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:55.687 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THAT FROM COURT TO COURT

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:58.690 region:rollup2
THINGS VERY AND THIS GIVES THE

00:35:55.687 --> 00:36:00.258 region:rollup2
JUDGE'S CRITERIA UNDER WHICH TO.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.826 region:rollup2
MANAGE THAT SITUATION

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:03.461 region:rollup2
AND IF I MAY ADD AS WELL THAT

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:04.929 region:rollup2
THE IT THE SITUATION HERE IS

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:05.797 region:rollup2
THAT THE COURTS AREN'T SURE HOW

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:07.365 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THIS AREA OF THE

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:08.767 region:rollup2
LAW RIGHT WE ALL KNOW THAT PETS

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.634 region:rollup2
ARE PERSONAL PROPERTY. BUT

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.036 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MUCH IN THE MEDIA

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:12.303 region:rollup2
THERE SO MANY ARGUMENTS BE MADE

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:14.339 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE COURT BUT IT IT

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:16.141 region:rollup2
MUDDIES THE ISSUE. AND SO WE

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:17.542 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THIS ACTUALLY A RELIEF

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:18.777 region:rollup2
VALVE FOR THE BACKLOG OF CASES

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:20.712 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CLEAR

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:22.013 region:rollup2
DIRECTIVE TO THE COURTS ON HOW

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:23.048 region:rollup2
TO HANDLE THESE CASES.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.416 region:rollup2
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT JUDGES ARE

00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:27.652 region:rollup2
IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:28.253 region:rollup2
COURTROOMS RIGHT SO THIS JUST IS

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:30.188 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD

00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:31.689 region:rollup2
EMBRACE THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IT

00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:32.957 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFIES AS IT PROVIDES A.

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:34.826 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR DIRECTIVE AND.

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.960 region:rollup2
.

00:36:34.826 --> 00:36:38.329 region:rollup2
IT AND EXPEDITES IT IN A VERY

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.731 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT WAY.

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.366 region:rollup2
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:43.868 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT THE

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:45.637 region:rollup2
BACKLOG AND HOW THIS MIGHT

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:47.238 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE BACKLOG I WILL BE

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:48.540 region:rollup2
VOTING FOR THIS BUT I I WOULD

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:50.608 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:53.344 region:rollup2
THAT. THERE ISN'T THAT THAT

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:55.780 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:57.682 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE BACKLOG FOR THE

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.217 region:rollup2
CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE VICIOUS

00:36:57.682 --> 00:37:01.119 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE PETS THAT WOULD BE

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:04.389 region:rollup2
MY ONLY CONCERN BUT I WILL BE

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:04.923 region:rollup2
VOTING FOR TODAY.

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:06.391 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I'M GONNA HAVE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE AMENDED

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:10.995 region:rollup2
VERSION THE BILL SETS FORTH THE

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.163 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT TAKES.

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:13.498 region:rollup2
SO SO JUDGE WOULD TAKE INTO

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.266 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION.

00:37:13.498 --> 00:37:16.935 region:rollup2
THE CARE OF THE PET AND DEFINES

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:19.571 region:rollup2
CARES CERTAINLY.

00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:21.206 region:rollup2
SO HOW IS THE JUDGE GOING TO

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:22.907 region:rollup2
DETERMINE. THAT.

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:23.508 region:rollup2
YOU AND UNDER.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:26.644 region:rollup2
THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS NEW

00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:27.946 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE.

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:29.314 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THAT THAT OUT OF

00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:31.116 region:rollup2
GOPHERS BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:31.683 region:rollup2
THE JUDGES WOULD MAKE THESE

00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:32.984 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON THE

00:37:31.683 --> 00:37:34.486 region:rollup2
FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.787 region:rollup2
THEM IN A CASE JUST LIKE THEY

00:37:34.486 --> 00:37:37.288 region:rollup2
WOULD ANY OTHER DECISION AND

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:39.157 region:rollup2
DIVIDING EQUITABLE COMMUNITY

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:41.359 region:rollup2
PROPERTY AND THE NOTION OF A PET

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:42.594 region:rollup2
CARE. CLINICAL CARE WE THINK IS

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.095 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH THAT A

00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:45.363 region:rollup2
TASK OF FOR A JUDGE WHO IS WELL

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:47.465 region:rollup2
VERSED IN TO THESE TYPES OF

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:48.833 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE.

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:50.735 region:rollup2
AGAIN ON THE FACTS BEFORE THEM

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:53.238 region:rollup2
SO. YOU KNOW THE FACTS WILL NEED

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:53.805 region:rollup2
TO BE WEIGHED CERTAINLY BUT THAT

00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:54.806 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY BEING DONE THESE

00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:56.374 region:rollup2
CASES ARE ARGUE THESE ISSUES ARE

00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:57.408 region:rollup2
TO BE HEARD. AND IF I MAY

00:37:56.374 --> 00:38:00.011 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

00:37:57.408 --> 00:38:01.646 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE WITNESS STATED

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:03.181 region:rollup2
IS OUR CONCERN.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:05.116 region:rollup2
UNDER FAMILY CODE SECTION TWO

00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:08.319 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN ANY PERSON IS ENTITLED

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:10.321 region:rollup2
TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. SO IF

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:12.290 region:rollup2
FAT MY SPOUSE AND I HAVE A

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:14.259 region:rollup2
DISPUTE OVER THE CAT I AM THEN

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.760 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY

00:38:14.259 --> 00:38:19.063 region:rollup2
HEARING WHY MIGHT WANT TO BRING

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.332 region:rollup2
IN WITNESSES THE VETERINARIAN. A

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:22.467 region:rollup2
TO TESTIFIED THAT I CAN PROVIDE

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:25.503 region:rollup2
BETTER CARE FOR THE CAP WHICH

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:26.938 region:rollup2
WILL INCREASE THE BACKLOG THAT'S

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.939 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS.

00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:29.007 region:rollup2
GOOD DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:30.008 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT LOOK AT WORK OUT

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:31.276 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING WITH ADDITIONAL

00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:32.410 region:rollup2
COUNSEL NOW. AND THEY HAVE THEY

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:33.912 region:rollup2
HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.647 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH US ON

00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:36.648 region:rollup2
THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:38.183 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:40.118 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD THEY DECIDE THAT

00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM

BUILT INTO AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.509 region:rollup2

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:54.678 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE LEVEL DECISION

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:55.613 region:rollup2
MAKERS ALREADY USE TO DETERMINE

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:57.815 region:rollup2

THE ADDITIONAL EXCEPTIONS THAT

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:03.787 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD ADD ARE NOT

00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:06.123 region:rollup2
NECESSARY IN PART BECAUSE STATE

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:07.624 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE RARELY USED TO SUPPORT

00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:08.826 region:rollup2
STATE TRAVEL FOR. YOU KNOW I'VE

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:10.094 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT TRAVEL FOR STATE

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:12.062 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS AND

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:13.597 region:rollup2

OTHER REVENUE SOURCES AND

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:18.035 region:rollup2
NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXAMPLES

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.869 region:rollup2
THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER

00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:19.937 region:rollup2
CITED AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:21.739 region:rollup2
OF A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WHERE

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:23.474 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:25.876 region:rollup2
USING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THIS

00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:27.177 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ABOUT USING STATE

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:28.345 region:rollup2
FUNDS FOR THIS TRAVEL.

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:29.913 region:rollup2
I'M MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:31.815 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS EVEN IF

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:33.884 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD RARELY BE USED CHIP

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:34.651 region:rollup2
AWAY AT THE IMPORTANT STATEMENT

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.520 region:rollup2
THAT AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:38.155 region:rollup2
MAKES. BY ALLOWING CALIFORNIA

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.123 region:rollup2
TAX DOLLARS TO BENEFIT STATES

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.624 region:rollup2
THAT ENGAGE IN BLATANT

00:52:39.123 --> 00:52:41.859 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION UNDER MORE AND

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.594 region:rollup2
MORE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:44.662 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY OUR CONCERN HERE

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:46.964 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS. UNDERMINES THE

00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:48.999 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE GOAL OF AB EIGHTEEN

00:52:46.964 --> 00:52:51.168 region:rollup2

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:52.036 region:rollup2
THAT IT MAKES DONT THE

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:52.903 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE ABOUT

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:54.271 region:rollup2
BUILDING INITIALLY WE BELIEVE

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:55.773 region:rollup2
COVER SITUATIONS THAT WILL ARISE

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.306 region:rollup2
WHERE STATE FUNDING DOES NEED TO

00:52:55.773 --> 00:52:57.374 region:rollup2
BE USED FOR TRAVEL TO THE

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:58.242 region:rollup2
STATES.

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.910 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE OTHER

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:01.812 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE FOR

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.781 region:rollup2
TRAVEL THAT DOESN'T USE

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:04.915 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE DOLLARS TO

00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:05.883 region:rollup2
BENEFIT STATES THAT COULD

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:07.184 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:10.020 region:rollup2

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN BE AND

AND CHILD ABUSE OF VERY VERY

01:09:56.626 --> 01:10:00.930 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUES.

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:03.866 region:rollup2

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:14.877 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WITH

RESPECT TO THAT CHILD IS WHAT AB

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:18.181 region:rollup2
TWENTY FORTY FOUR IS ALL ABOUT.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:20.450 region:rollup2
AS WE KNOW NOT JUST CHILD ABUSE

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:21.517 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BEING WITNESS TO

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.985 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ALSO CHILD

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:24.187 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:25.621 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:27.623 region:rollup2
IS TYING TOGETHER TO EXISTING

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:29.058 region:rollup2
CODE SECTIONS THAT GOVERN BOTH

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:31.394 region:rollup2

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:32.128 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS AND. AGAIN

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.663 region:rollup2
SETTING IT A LITTLE BIT

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:35.098 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STANDARD AROUND CHILD

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.833 region:rollup2
SAFETY CLARIFYING THAT THE

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:38.000 region:rollup2
PERPETUATION OF CHILD ABUSE AND

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.335 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.070 region:rollup2
AND THE HOUSEHOLD WITH A CHILD

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:42.772 region:rollup2
RESIDES IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.974 region:rollup2
HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:46.442 region:rollup2

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:48.478 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE SAFE AND FREE

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:49.545 region:rollup2
IF YOU.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:51.814 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALSO STRENGTHENS

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:53.449 region:rollup2
EXISTING PERCEPTIONS AROUND THE

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:55.752 region:rollup2
IN AGAINST A CUSTODY TO A

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:57.753 region:rollup2

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:59.455 region:rollup2
ALL AROUND ASKING COURTS TO LOOK

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:01.357 region:rollup2
AT THAT AGAIN TO PROTECT

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.925 region:rollup2
CHILDREN FROM BEING PLACED

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:04.727 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY WITH A BATTERER

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:06.295 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S SOME SOME DETAILS

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:08.297 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE YOU SEE IN THE BILL

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.865 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE GO THROUGH THAT WE

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.166 region:rollup2
ASK THE COURTS TO GO THROUGH

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:11.868 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS.

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:14.170 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A CHILD SAFETY BELT

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:15.605 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS BANNED LONG

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.639 region:rollup2

FORTY FOUR.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:52.041 region:rollup2
THE PRESUMPTION AGAINST CUSTODY

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:53.576 region:rollup2
TO BATTERERS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:56.078 region:rollup2

FROM ALL OVER THE STATE WE DON'T

CHARGE THEM ANYTHING. OUR

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.386 region:rollup2

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR

CHILDREN.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.890 region:rollup2
IN THE SIX YEARS WE HAVE NO

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:10.126 region:rollup2

OF WE OF COURSE CAN'T TAKE THEM

ALL BUT WE HAVE REPRESENTED

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.132 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN FORTY TWO CASES SO

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:17.800 region:rollup2
FAR.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:19.468 region:rollup2
AND TWELVE FRIEND OF THE COURT

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.704 region:rollup2
BRIEFS AND WE'VE OUR WORK HAS

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:23.573 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN THIRTY ONE PUBLISHED

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:26.475 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN SIX YEARS.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:27.643 region:rollup2
FELT REALLY INFO INFLUENCES SO

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.978 region:rollup2
AREA OF LAW AND WHAT WE'VE

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.279 region:rollup2
NOTICED.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:32.114 region:rollup2
WILL BE SEEN VERY CLEARLY IS

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.883 region:rollup2
THAT THE TRIAL COURTS ARE STILL

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:36.352 region:rollup2
AWARDING CUSTODY EITHER JOINT

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:38.087 region:rollup2
CUSTODY OR SOLE CUSTODY TOO MANY

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:40.022 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE PERPETRATORS.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.557 region:rollup2
OF ABUSE AND SO WE THINK THAT

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.292 region:rollup2
THE SECTIONS NEED TO BE

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:44.994 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED IN STRENGTHENED.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:47.697 region:rollup2
TOM SPECIFICALLY.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:49.198 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.533 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE BILL I BELIEVE IS

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.335 region:rollup2
THAT ENTER FAMILY CUT THIRTY

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.769 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR THE PRESUMPTION

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:57.340 region:rollup2
AGAINST CUSTODY THE BATTERS

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:59.508 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE. A DAD WHO

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:01.043 region:rollup2
IS SEPARATED FROM THE MOM AND

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:03.479 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THE CHILDREN IF YOU

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:05.147 region:rollup2
PART TIME. AND YOU ARE ABUSING

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.882 region:rollup2
YOUR CURRENT GIRLFRIEND OR

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:09.118 region:rollup2
SPOUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE CONVICTED

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:09.619 region:rollup2
OF THAT. THAT DOES NOT RAISE THE

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:12.321 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:13.890 region:rollup2
AGAINST CUSTODY.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.191 region:rollup2
DONE AND WE THINK THAT IT NEEDS

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.926 region:rollup2
TO BE INCLUDED.

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:18.761 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST THE OTHER

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:20.029 region:rollup2
PARENT OF THE CHILD THAT WE

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:21.697 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HAS THAT

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:24.300 region:rollup2
PERSON ABUSED THEM. FOR MOMMA

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:26.569 region:rollup2
THE CHILD BUT ALSO HAS THE DAD

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:28.137 region:rollup2
OR. COULD BE A MOM.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.538 region:rollup2
ABUSE THEIR CURRENT PARTNER.

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:31.307 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:33.209 region:rollup2
BE EXPOSED TO THIS PERIOD.

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:35.044 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PART SETS IN THAT

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:36.779 region:rollup2
SECTION THIRTY FORTY FOUR IS TO

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:38.848 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THE FIVE YEARS.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:40.316 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS SO IT WOULD SAY THAT

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.751 region:rollup2
THE FIVE YEARS.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:43.419 region:rollup2
AND UNDER WHICH THE PRESUMPTION

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:45.187 region:rollup2
APPLIES STARTS WHEN THE COURT

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.589 region:rollup2
MAKES ITS INITIAL FINDING OF

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:48.457 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THIS IS

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:49.792 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL. BECAUSE IT'S SORT

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:51.694 region:rollup2
OF UNCLEAR FRANKLY IN THE

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:53.429 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATUTE WHEN THAT FIVE

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:54.463 region:rollup2
YEARS IS SUPPOSED TO START AND

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:57.500 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:58.868 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CUSTODY LITIGATION

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.570 region:rollup2
LIKE GOLF FAMILY WHY LITIGATION.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:02.705 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME WE

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.773 region:rollup2
JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT EARLIER.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:06.709 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING AND THAT'S

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:08.744 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TRUE. AND WE THINK

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:10.546 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE THAT PERSON HAS BEEN

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:12.014 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE ON.

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:13.749 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEY WILL ALSO TRY TO

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.116 region:rollup2
DRAG OUT THE QUICK PROCEEDING

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:16.552 region:rollup2
AND.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:18.688 region:rollup2
IF THEY CAN MAKE IT LONGER THAN

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:19.855 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS THEN FARE US SINCE

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.090 region:rollup2
THEY ABUSE THEIR PARTNERS THEN

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:22.391 region:rollup2
THE PRESUMPTION UNDER THE

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.993 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW WOULD NOT APPLY AND

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:25.328 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT IT. SHOULD APPLY

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.762 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH THE FINDING OF

01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:28.664 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:31.567 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY A WE WERE ALSO.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:33.903 region:rollup2
IN FAVOR OF ADDING VISITATION.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:36.906 region:rollup2
TO THE PRESUMPTION RIGHT NOW.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:38.774 region:rollup2
THE COURTS OF CONSIDER THIS

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:40.209 region:rollup2
STUFF ONLY IN TERMS OF CUSTODY.

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:41.277 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IF IT'S DANGEROUS FOR

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:43.479 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN TO BE IN THE

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:44.780 region:rollup2
CUSTODY OF AN ABUSIVE PARENT.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.582 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS FOR

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.150 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE ALONE. WITH THAT

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:49.785 region:rollup2
PARENT WHETHER WE CALL IT

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.520 region:rollup2
CUSTODY OR VISITATION.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.289 region:rollup2
AND ALONG THE SAME LINES MANY

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.057 region:rollup2
COURTS NOW ARE USING THE TERM

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:56.692 region:rollup2
PARENTING TIME.

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:57.760 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT CUSTODY

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.662 region:rollup2
THEY'LL TALK ABOUT VISITATION

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.464 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT PARENTING TIME.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:03.132 region:rollup2
AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS.

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:04.066 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILDREN

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:06.035 region:rollup2
BEING WITH ABUSIVE PARENTS

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:07.536 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE APPLIED IN ANY KIND OF

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.904 region:rollup2
PARENTING TIME.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.106 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEIR TIME WITH THE

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:12.007 region:rollup2
CHILDREN SHOULD BE SUPERVISED

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:13.976 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE COURT DECIDES OKAY.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:15.344 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.779 region:rollup2
REDEEM THEMSELVES THEY'VE BEEN

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.581 region:rollup2
REHABILITATED THEY CAN NOW.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.449 region:rollup2
HAVE UNSUPERVISED VISITATION

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:22.785 region:rollup2
LATER ON.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:24.487 region:rollup2
THE FINAL PART THAT WE'RE VERY

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:26.055 region:rollup2
MUCH IN FAVOR OF IS MORE

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:27.490 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR JUDGES ON

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:29.358 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE EFFECTS ON

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.760 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. OF PEEING IN HOMES

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:32.762 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S ABUSE GOING ON

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.130 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY OF VERY BAD FOR THEIR

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:36.565 region:rollup2
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND FOR THEIR

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.133 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL SAFETY.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:42.972 region:rollup2
SO WE URGE HERE I FELT THANK

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:44.640 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:46.208 region:rollup2
KATHERINE CAMPBELL AND EXECUTIVE

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.710 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR AT CALIFORNIA

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.211 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.279 region:rollup2
OUR ASSOCIATION GOT STARTED

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:52.548 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:54.316 region:rollup2
A CASE OF A CHILD WITH.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:56.585 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE.

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:57.887 region:rollup2
STAND SHE ADDED REPORTS OF ABUSE

01:15:56.585 --> 01:16:00.089 region:rollup2
THEM WHO WAS FORCED TO LIVE WITH

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.190 region:rollup2
HIS ABUSER. IN THIS CASE IT WAS

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.858 region:rollup2
THE FATHER.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.827 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE SEEING ABUSE

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:06.395 region:rollup2
DISMISSED IN THE COURTS AND WE

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:08.864 region:rollup2

THE KAISER PERMANENTE A STUDY.

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:14.437 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS THE EFFECTS OF THE

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:16.705 region:rollup2
LONG TERM EFFECTS ON THE CHILD.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:18.474 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:21.010 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES IN THEIR LIFE

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:22.878 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU HAVE FOUR OR MORE OF

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:25.514 region:rollup2
THESE EXPERIENCES.

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:27.283 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:29.018 region:rollup2
CANCER AND HEART DISEASE.

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:30.086 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE SIX

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:31.720 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TWENTY YEARS OFF YOUR

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:34.156 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.291 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE KNOW

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:37.193 region:rollup2
AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:39.361 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND WHEN WE IGNORE THE

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:41.697 region:rollup2
ABUSE. WE ARE SAYING THAT WE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:43.265 region:rollup2
WANT. I MEAN WE ARE AT A POINT

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:44.967 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW I JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:47.203 region:rollup2
BURKE HARRIS SPEAK WHO'S.

PEDIATRICIAN IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:53.542 region:rollup2
AND SHE HAS STATED THAT THIS IS

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:55.244 region:rollup2
THREE TRILLION DOLLARS THAT WE

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:57.746 region:rollup2
SPEND ON OUR ECONOMY IN THE U.

01:16:55.244 --> 01:17:00.082 region:rollup2
S. PER YEAR. ON HEALTH ISSUES

01:16:57.746 --> 01:17:01.550 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:04.086 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE LESSENED

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:06.489 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:09.391 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE. THE WAVE OF THE

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:11.160 region:rollup2
ME TOO MOVEMENT AND HOME IS THE

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:12.862 region:rollup2
LAST PLACE PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.164 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING ABUSED.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:16.765 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE FIRST PLACE.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:18.434 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDREN NEED TO BE SAFE.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:22.037 region:rollup2
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:23.772 region:rollup2
KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:25.908 region:rollup2

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:28.177 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AS WELL

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:29.178 region:rollup2
AS I'M GOING TO. LET YOU KNOW

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:31.213 region:rollup2
THAT THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:33.115 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT ALSO IS ASKING FOR

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:34.650 region:rollup2
YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS TEST SHE'S

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:36.552 region:rollup2
RUNNING LATE.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.354 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:40.322 region:rollup2
OUR CHILDREN MATTER.

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THE EFFECTS WE KNOW

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:44.193 region:rollup2
THE COST.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.594 region:rollup2
TOO ARE SOCIETY WE KNOW THE COST

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:47.363 region:rollup2
TO THESE CHILDREN.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:49.365 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THE RISK FACTORS

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:51.066 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST TWO FACED ACES GOES

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:53.536 region:rollup2
UP.

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:55.037 region:rollup2
TWO SUICIDE UNABLE TO FINISH

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:57.306 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL.

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:58.874 region:rollup2
AND IT'S HURTING US.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:00.676 region:rollup2
AS A SOCIETY AND IT'S TIME THAT

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:02.545 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT ABUSE DIFFERENTLY AND

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:04.747 region:rollup2
MORE STRONGLY.

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:08.150 region:rollup2
AND WE DO ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:08.150 region:rollup2
THERE IS TRAINING THERE NEEDS TO

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:11.854 region:rollup2
THESE JUDGES NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:14.123 region:rollup2
WHAT A CHILD DOES GO THROUGH.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:15.257 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE WITH AN ABUSER.

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:17.092 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT'S VERY.

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:18.027 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL WE'VE SEEN MANY OF

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:19.995 region:rollup2
THESE CHILDREN.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.829 region:rollup2
AND AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:22.898 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO ANYONE YET WHERE

AMENDMENTS TO FAMILY CODE

AS TO WHAT THINGS THE COURTS

NEED TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.478 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT WHAT I SEE

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:18.681 region:rollup2
MOST IN MY PRACTICE IS ACTUALLY

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:20.816 region:rollup2
THE ABUSE OF NARCOTICS AND

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:22.117 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THIRTY

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:23.886 region:rollup2
ELEVEN AND THE AMENDMENTS I'M

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:25.320 region:rollup2
GREATLY ASSIST IN THAT AS DO

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:27.122 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWENTY.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.624 region:rollup2
WE APART WE SUPPORT THE

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:30.359 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO FAMILY CODE SECTION

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.660 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY FOUR HALF

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:34.129 region:rollup2
WHICH REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.031 region:rollup2
OFFICERS TO STATE IN WRITING.

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:38.300 region:rollup2
THE REASONS IF A PARTY HAS

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:40.903 region:rollup2
REBUTTED THE PRESUMPTION UNDER

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.471 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY FOUR. AYE BECAUSE

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:43.739 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY TO EIGHTY

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:45.674 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF THE LITIGANTS

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:48.410 region:rollup2
ARE SELF REPRESENTED THEY HAVE A

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:50.179 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THE JUDGES

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.447 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ORDER BUT WHY.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.782 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST STRONGLY

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:55.584 region:rollup2
OPPOSE ALL OF THEIR AMENDMENTS

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:57.419 region:rollup2
TO THIRTY FORTY FOUR OF THE

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.954 region:rollup2
FORGET THAT I APOLOGIZE TO ALSO

01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:59.521 region:rollup2
DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.689 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.757 region:rollup2
CODE.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.492 region:rollup2
FOR MORE TRAINING FOR JUDICIAL

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:05.494 region:rollup2
OFFICERS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:06.595 region:rollup2
IN FAMILY LAW WE ALWAYS SUPPORT

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:08.430 region:rollup2
MORE TRAINING FOR JUDICIAL

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:10.599 region:rollup2
OFFICERS AND FAMILY LAW.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:12.000 region:rollup2
WHY DO WE OPPOSE THE AMENDMENTS

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.468 region:rollup2
TO THIRTY FORTY FOUR?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.037 region:rollup2
WELL DOMESTIC ABUSE IS

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:16.071 region:rollup2
ABHORRENT.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2
CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:18.907 region:rollup2
PROTECTED.

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:21.844 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A PERSON

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:23.779 region:rollup2
IN THIS WORLD WILL DISPUTE THAT.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:26.749 region:rollup2
HOWEVER FAMILY CODE SECTION

01:21:23.779 --> 01:21:29.118 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY FOUR DEALS WITH THE

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:31.487 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTIONS THAT THE COURT MUST

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:34.423 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:35.924 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT A PARTY HAS

01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:38.127 region:rollup2
COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:40.596 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE OTHER PARENT.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:41.230 region:rollup2
THE CHILD OF THE RELATIONSHIP OR

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:47.002 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE CHILD SIBLINGS FORTY

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:49.104 region:rollup2
FOUR ALREADY PROVIDES THE

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:52.274 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT THE COURT LOOKS AT

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:54.543 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THERE HAS

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:56.412 region:rollup2
BEEN A REBUTTAL OF THE.

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:57.479 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION AGAINST JOINT.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.214 region:rollup2
LEGAL CUSTODY OR PHYSICAL

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:01.083 region:rollup2
CUSTODY.

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:02.584 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.253 region:rollup2
CORRECT THAT IT DOES NOT

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.687 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DEAL WITH VISITATION.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:08.123 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:10.526 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF THIS THIRTY FORTY

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:11.760 region:rollup2
FOUR. UNSUPERVISED VISITATION

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:12.928 region:rollup2
UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THE

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.630 region:rollup2
PARENT WITH THE DOMESTIC

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:16.331 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE FINDING HAS REBUTTED

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.800 region:rollup2
THE PRESUMPTION. BY COMPLETING

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.333 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS AND THIRTY

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.636 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR WE BELIEVE THAT

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:22.738 region:rollup2
COULD.

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:23.472 region:rollup2
UNEXPECTEDLY.

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:25.707 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CALL UNINTENDED

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:28.811 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT IN A

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:30.913 region:rollup2
LOSS OF CONTACT BETWEEN A PARENT

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:32.748 region:rollup2
AND A CHILD AND SITUATION?

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:34.583 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS BEEN

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:36.618 region:rollup2
EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:37.619 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THERE ARE

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:40.989 region:rollup2
CASES THAT I'M HAVE COME UP ON

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:43.826 region:rollup2
APPEAL. THAT IF YOU HAVE BEEN

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:44.760 region:rollup2
WRITING LOVE LETTERS TO A A

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:46.495 region:rollup2
PARTNER.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.429 region:rollup2
AND YOUR WRITING IS HARASSING

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:48.730 region:rollup2
LOVE LETTERS THAT YOU WANT THAT

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:50.566 region:rollup2
PERSON BACK

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:51.800 region:rollup2
THAT'S GROUNDS FOR DOMESTIC

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:52.634 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER EVEN

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.136 region:rollup2
GET A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST YOU

FOR THAT. SO IN THAT

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:59.041 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE LET'S SAY THE MOM

01:22:57.706 --> 01:23:02.110 region:rollup2
WHO'S BEEN THE PRIMARY CUSTODIAL

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:03.345 region:rollup2
PARENT HER HUSBAND LEAVES HER

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:05.080 region:rollup2
AND SHE'S DEVASTATED IS WRITING.

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:06.515 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS PLEASE COME

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.783 region:rollup2
BACK TO ME HONEY.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:09.384 region:rollup2
HE HAS THE GROUNDS TO GET A

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.953 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER AND THE COURT

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.954 region:rollup2
WILL LIKELY ORDER RESTRAINING

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:13.655 region:rollup2
ORDER AGAINST THIS PRIMARY

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:16.158 region:rollup2
CUSTODIAL PARENT NOW THERE'S A

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.960 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION AGAINST HER. HAVING

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:20.095 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY CUSTODY BUT ANY

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.630 region:rollup2
VISITATION IS NOT SUPERVISED

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:23.966 region:rollup2
WITH THE CHILD WHO MAY BE HER

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:25.934 region:rollup2
PRIMARY ATTACHMENT FIGURE UNLESS

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:28.103 region:rollup2
SHE REBUTS THESE FACTORS AND

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:29.638 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY FOUR. WE HAVE A

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:31.039 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THAT THE OTHER

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:33.742 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:36.111 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH IS THE EXPANSION OF

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:38.213 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO QUOTE ANY

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:39.548 region:rollup2
OTHER PERSON. FOR WHOM THE PARTY

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:41.683 region:rollup2
HAS HAD A RELATIONSHIP AS

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:42.317 region:rollup2
DEFINED IN SECTION SIXTY TWO

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.585 region:rollup2
ELEVEN.

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.620 region:rollup2
OUR REASONING FOR THAT IS WE

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:47.189 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT WILL OPEN UP A

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:49.157 region:rollup2
PANDORA'S BOX OF LITIGATION OF A

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:52.494 region:rollup2
TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL. SO FOR

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:53.662 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A A COUPLE

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:56.632 region:rollup2
WHO HAD A CHILD.

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:59.434 region:rollup2
AND THE HUSBAND HAD A ROCKY

01:23:56.632 --> 01:24:01.236 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH A PRICE YOUR

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:03.005 region:rollup2
PARTNER FOUR YEARS AGO IT'S

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:04.306 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:05.774 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC ABUSE IN THIS

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:10.045 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP TO THE OTHER PARENT

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.447 region:rollup2
TO THE CHILDREN HOWEVER IN THIS

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:14.016 region:rollup2
SITUATION THEN THE PARENT WHO IS

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:15.484 region:rollup2
SEEKING SOLE CUSTODY AND

01:24:14.016 --> 01:24:17.519 region:rollup2
SUPERVISES THE TATIAN. COULD

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:19.288 region:rollup2
MAKE THE MERE ALLEGATION BECAUSE

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:21.657 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS JUST TALK ABOUT

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:23.892 region:rollup2
AN ALLEGATION THAT THE OTHER

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:25.928 region:rollup2
PARENT HAD COMMITTED DOMESTIC

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:28.163 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE OR DOMESTIC ABUSE

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:30.032 region:rollup2
AGAINST HIS A PARTNER FOR YEARS

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:32.034 region:rollup2
AGO ON A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP.

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:33.101 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BRING UP THE

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:35.203 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION IN THIS CASE.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:36.238 region:rollup2
AND THE TERMINOLOGY ALSO SAYS

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:38.006 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS JUST A MERE

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:39.441 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION OF DVD THE COURT MUST

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:41.910 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER THE THIRTY

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.444 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR APPLIES BEFORE

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.012 region:rollup2
ISSUING ANY CUTS IN YOUR

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:45.314 region:rollup2
VISITATION ORDERS. THAT COULD

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:47.683 region:rollup2
CAUSE YOU TO HAVE A TRIAL WITHIN

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:49.885 region:rollup2
A TRIAL AS TO WHETHER ANY D. V.

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:51.653 region:rollup2
OCCURRED BETWEEN THIS PARENT AND

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:53.055 region:rollup2
A PRIMARY PARTNER FOR THIS

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:55.257 region:rollup2
PARENT COULD HAVE ANY

01:24:53.055 --> 01:24:57.359 region:rollup2
UNSUPERVISED CONTACT WITH HIS OR

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.060 region:rollup2
HER CHILDREN. THAT GREATLY

01:24:57.359 --> 01:25:00.462 region:rollup2
CONCERNS US

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:41.069 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:42.371 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF THE HIGHEST ORDER

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:44.606 region:rollup2
IN THAT IT'S PROTECTING OUR

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:46.308 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND WHERE EVER THERE'S

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:48.877 region:rollup2
BEEN A BATTERER.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:50.145 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEIR HISTORY. THE THE

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:51.980 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:53.582 region:rollup2
ARE PUT TOGETHER TO TRY AND

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.784 region:rollup2
OVERCOME.

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:57.452 region:rollup2
AND HELP THAT BATTERER ARE

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:58.553 region:rollup2
REALLY NETWORKING RECIDIVISM

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.888 region:rollup2
RATE IN THE BATTERY INTERVENTION

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:02.491 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IS UP IN THE ORDERS OF

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:03.392 region:rollup2
OF EIGHTY PERCENT. AND SO WE DID

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.560 region:rollup2
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD

01:26:03.392 --> 01:26:07.596 region:rollup2
SITUATION BATTERERS TEND TO

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.364 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HURT. AND IF THEY

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:11.066 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT CHILD OR ARE

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:12.200 region:rollup2
BATTERING.

01:26:11.066 --> 01:26:13.835 region:rollup2
SPOUSE OR CURRENT PARTNER EVEN

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.303 region:rollup2
IF IT'S NOT A RELATION TO THAT

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.905 region:rollup2
CHILD THAT HAS A VERY

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:18.907 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT AND CAN BE

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:20.942 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE ON THAT CHILD. THIS IS

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:21.510 region:rollup2
WHY WE SET THE STANDARD WE'VE

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:21.910 region:rollup2
ALSO TRIED TO SET A STANDARD

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.412 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:25.080 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THE COURT IS IN

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:26.481 region:rollup2
FACT

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.583 region:rollup2
OVERSEEING BECAUSE IT'S A

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:31.153 region:rollup2
NUANCED SITUATION AND IT'S NOT

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:32.020 region:rollup2
ALWAYS IT'S VERY FACT SPECIFIC

01:26:31.153 --> 01:26:33.555 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.557 region:rollup2
CLEAR WE WANT THE COURTS.

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:37.559 region:rollup2
TO BE OVERSEEING.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:39.361 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS HERE AND MAKES OF

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:40.996 region:rollup2
THESE DETERMINATIONS BEFORE

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.631 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TOWARD CUSTODY OR

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.799 region:rollup2
VISITATION AND IT IS JUST

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:45.834 region:rollup2
UNSUPERVISED VISITATION THAT

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:47.269 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:48.837 region:rollup2
CASE BUT THAT BIG THAT'S RIGHT

01:26:47.269 --> 01:26:50.005 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WE HAVE THIS BILL

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:51.807 region:rollup2
HAS COME A LONG WAY.

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:53.108 region:rollup2
SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:54.910 region:rollup2
TOGETHER BECAUSE OF SOME THE

01:26:53.108 --> 01:26:56.745 region:rollup2
OPPOSITIONS AND THE CONCERNS

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:58.246 region:rollup2
SOME THE CONCERNS. ARE.

01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:00.015 region:rollup2
VERY REASONABLE THAT THAT HAVE

01:26:58.246 --> 01:27:01.950 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED AND AND WE'RE

01:27:00.015 --> 01:27:03.318 region:rollup2
WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK WE

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.920 region:rollup2
HAVE ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER MEETING

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:06.955 region:rollup2
IN MAY. SO I THINK THIS BILL IS

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.523 region:rollup2
WORTHY OF PASSING AT THIS POINT

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:10.225 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BILL STANDS.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:12.861 region:rollup2
FROM MY STANDPOINT STANDS ON ITS

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:14.830 region:rollup2
OWN NOW BUT KNOWING THAT THERE

01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:16.631 region:rollup2
ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE DO NOT

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:18.300 region:rollup2
WANT TO UNNECESSARILY TAKE A

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:19.501 region:rollup2
CHILD AWAY FROM A PAIR BECAUSE

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.169 region:rollup2
THAT PARENTAL EXPOSURE IS VERY

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:23.305 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:25.006 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD BUT IT HAS TO BE IN

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:26.341 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION THAT IS FOR THE.

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:28.210 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF THAT CHILD FOR THE

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:29.511 region:rollup2
HEALTH FOR THE WELL BEING AND

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:30.078 region:rollup2

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:32.948 region:rollup2

EVEN IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:15.787 region:rollup2
THE COUNCIL HAS A LONG STANDING

02:23:13.919 --> 02:23:18.290 region:rollup2
POLICY OF OPPOSING CATEGORICAL

02:23:15.787 --> 02:23:19.825 region:rollup2

NUMBER OF AVAILABLE JURORS.

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:31.369 region:rollup2
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:33.271 region:rollup2
SELECT REPRESENTATIVE JURIES AND

02:23:31.369 --> 02:23:35.207 region:rollup2

02:23:35.207 --> 02:23:37.409 region:rollup2

02:23:36.575 --> 02:23:39.111 region:rollup2
FURTHER THE COURTS HAVE A

02:23:37.409 --> 02:23:40.779 region:rollup2

JURORS IN SMALL JURISDICTIONS

02:23:54.626 --> 02:23:55.861 region:rollup2
YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS EVEN

02:23:55.227 --> 02:23:57.696 region:rollup2
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:23:55.861 --> 02:24:00.131 region:rollup2
SO FEW PEOPLE.

CITIZENS.

02:24:22.287 --> 02:24:25.891 region:rollup2
EXEMPTING CERTAIN CLASSES OF

INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THE BURDEN

02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:28.727 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT POSE ON THEM.

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:30.061 region:rollup2
UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN ON

OTHERS.

02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:33.732 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN MANY CHANGES IN

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:35.400 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS DESIGNED

02:24:33.732 --> 02:24:37.969 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO LESSEN THE

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:40.739 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF JURY DUTY ON CITIZEN.

SO OF MANY PEOPLE CAN SHOW UP IN

02:24:44.409 --> 02:24:46.745 region:rollup2
THE MORNING AND BE DISMISSED BY

NOON.

02:24:46.745 --> 02:24:50.849 region:rollup2
IMPROVING THE SUMMONS PROCESS

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:51.883 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW REQUESTS FOR EXCUSES TO

02:24:50.849 --> 02:24:54.519 region:rollup2
BE MADE.

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:57.222 region:rollup2
BUT ALLOWING THE JURY POOL TO

02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:59.691 region:rollup2
COME INTO THE COURT AND. MAKING

02:24:57.222 --> 02:25:01.493 region:rollup2
SURE FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOMEBODY

02:24:59.691 --> 02:25:03.428 region:rollup2
GOES TO A CIVIL TRIAL A RATHER

02:25:01.493 --> 02:25:05.964 region:rollup2
THAN A CRIMINAL TRIAL IS EASIER

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:07.265 region:rollup2
THAN KEEPING TWO SEPARATE LIVES.

02:25:05.964 --> 02:25:10.068 region:rollup2
WHO'S GETTING CALLED IN.

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:12.137 region:rollup2

BURDEN ON HAVING TO SEPARATE.

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:19.611 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO WOULD BE QUALIFIED

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
FOR CIVIL TRIAL AND THOSE FOR

02:25:19.611 --> 02:25:24.182 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL TRIAL IS A BURDEN THAT

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:25.717 region:rollup2
MANY COURTS CAN'T EASILY ABSORB.

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:27.385 region:rollup2
AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR SO

02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:29.554 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE REASONS.

02:25:27.385 --> 02:25:31.056 region:rollup2
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE COUNCIL

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:33.491 region:rollup2
WOULD CHANGE ITS POSITION GIVEN

02:25:31.056 --> 02:25:34.593 region:rollup2

THAT THEY THINK THEIR EXCUSE

SUGGESTED. THAT JUDGES DON'T

ALWAYS ENTERTAIN THAT BUT I'VE

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:41.259 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEVER HEARD THAT TO BE

02:26:39.391 --> 02:26:42.727 region:rollup2
THE CASE. IF WE HEAR THAT WE

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:44.296 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT TO BE ONE OF

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:46.498 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND NOT THAT NEEDS A

02:26:44.296 --> 02:26:48.300 region:rollup2
STATUTORY PROVISION JUDGES DO

FUNDAMENTAL PART OF OUR

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:14.259 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY AND WE'RE CONCERNED

02:27:12.157 --> 02:27:16.194 region:rollup2
ABOUT ASKING THE PUBLIC TO DO

02:27:14.259 --> 02:27:17.829 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT. OTHERS ARE WILLING

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

OPPOSITION.

02:27:24.703 --> 02:27:29.107 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS MISTER GRAYSON AND

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:30.975 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE.

02:27:29.107 --> 02:27:32.744 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BEEN VERY VERY CONCERNED

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:35.180 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND FACT. A LOT OF THE

02:27:32.744 --> 02:27:36.748 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AND IT WAS BUT I WAS

02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:38.316 region:rollup2
FINE WITH THIS MOVING FORWARD

02:27:36.748 --> 02:27:40.185 region:rollup2
WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT SOME THE

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:43.988 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY RAISES EXACTLY THE

02:27:40.185 --> 02:27:45.490 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT I HAVE. AND.

02:27:43.988 --> 02:27:46.725 region:rollup2
GOES RIGHT TO MY CONCERNS JUST

02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:48.093 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS THE

02:27:46.725 --> 02:27:49.361 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY

02:27:48.093 --> 02:27:51.229 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN ANOTHER GROUP

02:27:49.361 --> 02:27:53.331 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE THAT. I DON'T BUY

02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:54.899 region:rollup2
THAT AT ALL. AND BECAUSE YOUR

02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:56.334 region:rollup2
JOB IMPORTANT AND I'M NOT

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:57.836 region:rollup2
MINIMIZING YOUR JOBS AT ALL I

02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:59.537 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE CREDIBLY PORT I

02:27:57.836 --> 02:28:00.939 region:rollup2
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH.

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:02.774 region:rollup2
PROBATION SHE SAID APPROBATION

02:28:00.939 --> 02:28:04.209 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS TRYING TO ENSURE

02:28:02.774 --> 02:28:06.177 region:rollup2
THAT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:08.279 region:rollup2
IS AS RESPONSIVE AS IT POSSIBLY

02:28:06.177 --> 02:28:09.814 region:rollup2
CAN BE AND ESPECIALLY TO THE

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:10.348 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THOSE. IN YOUR CARE

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:12.283 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S JUVENILES OR

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:14.386 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:16.921 region:rollup2
TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY FOR THAT

02:28:14.386 --> 02:28:18.223 region:rollup2
REASON THERE ARE. ANY NUMBER OF

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:20.024 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES WHERE WE WOULD IF WE

02:28:18.223 --> 02:28:21.326 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THAT LOGIC WE WOULD BE

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:23.228 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING PEOPLE FOR JURY DUTY

02:28:21.326 --> 02:28:24.829 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.

02:28:23.228 --> 02:28:25.930 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY

02:28:24.829 --> 02:28:27.132 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR JUSTICE

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:28.900 region:rollup2
SYSTEM

02:28:27.132 --> 02:28:30.935 region:rollup2
IS THE OBLIGATION FOR ALL OF US

02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:31.936 region:rollup2
TO SERVE ON JURIES I'VE SERVED

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:33.838 region:rollup2
I'VE I'VE SHOWED UP I THINK

02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:35.073 region:rollup2
KICKED OFF.

02:28:33.838 --> 02:28:37.342 region:rollup2
I AS A LAW STUDENT I SERVED ON A

02:28:35.073 --> 02:28:39.210 region:rollup2
JURY Y. I WAS LET STAY ON AS A

02:28:37.342 --> 02:28:40.645 region:rollup2
LAW STUDENT STILLS I SCRATCH MY

02:28:39.210 --> 02:28:42.480 region:rollup2
HEAD OVER BECAUSE THAT'S

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:44.749 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE WORST OR YOU COULD.

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.618 region:rollup2
HAVE WAS ME AS A LAW STUDENT.

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:47.852 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

02:28:46.618 --> 02:28:49.854 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

02:28:47.852 --> 02:28:51.756 region:rollup2
FIND EXCUSES

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:54.325 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:55.927 region:rollup2
JURY DUTY. THEN WE MINIMIZE THE

02:28:54.325 --> 02:28:57.996 region:rollup2
POOLS WE WE STE

02:28:55.927 --> 02:28:59.697 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY TAKE.

02:28:57.996 --> 02:29:00.765 region:rollup2
A REAL HIT TO OUR OVERALL

02:28:59.697 --> 02:29:03.434 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OUR

02:29:00.765 --> 02:29:05.503 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS AS CITIZENS.

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:08.039 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY OCCUPATIONS THAT

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:11.109 region:rollup2
ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND.

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:12.877 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT BEING THE REASON.

02:29:11.109 --> 02:29:14.112 region:rollup2
IS REALLY BEYOND ME THE THE FACT

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:16.080 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE POTENTIALLY

02:29:14.112 --> 02:29:18.183 region:rollup2
SUPERVISING SOMEBODY WHO'S THERE

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:19.484 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE.

02:29:18.183 --> 02:29:21.119 region:rollup2
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP OR THAT

02:29:19.484 --> 02:29:22.220 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT.

02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:23.788 region:rollup2
PUT YOURSELF THAT AT SOME

02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:26.024 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL RISK.

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:27.125 region:rollup2
OKAY IN A CRIMINAL CONTEXT I SEE

02:29:26.024 --> 02:29:28.927 region:rollup2
THAT THE REGIONAL BILL WAS FOR

02:29:27.125 --> 02:29:30.295 region:rollup2
CIVIL. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT

02:29:28.927 --> 02:29:32.130 region:rollup2
TRUE.

02:29:30.295 --> 02:29:34.432 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS

02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:36.134 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE TO.

02:29:34.432 --> 02:29:37.569 region:rollup2
TO TAKE TO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

02:29:36.134 --> 02:29:39.270 region:rollup2
AND AND REALLY ONLY TALK ABOUT.

02:29:37.569 --> 02:29:40.738 region:rollup2
THE CRIMINAL SIDE OF THINGS BUT

02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:43.341 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW THIS BILL MOVES

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:44.008 region:rollup2
FORWARD. DON'T MISTAKE THIS

02:29:43.341 --> 02:29:45.577 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES PERSPECTIVE ON IT

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:47.545 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:29:45.577 --> 02:29:48.947 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO BE OPENING UP.

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:51.583 region:rollup2
ANYBODY THE COME FORWARD AND SAY

02:29:48.947 --> 02:29:53.551 region:rollup2
MY JOB IS TO IMPORTANCE

02:29:51.583 --> 02:29:55.453 region:rollup2
TO TO. WALK AWAY FROM MY

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:56.955 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION AS A

ABOUT. SO I I JUST GOTTA PUT

02:30:04.896 --> 02:30:08.433 region:rollup2

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:09.601 region:rollup2
WHAT MOST THE TESTIMONY WAS THAT

02:30:08.433 --> 02:30:11.569 region:rollup2
TO ME WAS PERSONALLY VERY

02:30:09.601 --> 02:30:13.037 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING SINCE I. THOUGHT WE

WERE PRETTY CLEAR AND IN WHY WE

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:15.406 region:rollup2
