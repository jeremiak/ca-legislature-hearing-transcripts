HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOSE MEDINA. HONORABLE GUESTS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. EQUITY IN UPPER ACCESS WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AN OUTSIDE WITHIN THE WORLD OF WORK IS AN EXTENSION OF OUR LONG DIFFICULT AN UGLY HISTORY. NOW FOR TOO LONG ONLY OFFERED LIP SERVICE TO EQUITY AND NOW DEPRIVED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM REACHING THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. AND I'VE ALSO DEPRIVED THE NATION FROM VITAL AND CREATIVE PRIEST IS NOT COMES FROM ITS DIVERSE CHILDREN. WE ARE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES FOR THE VISION FOR SUCCESS TO DECREASE EQUITY BY 40% IN THE COMING FIVE YEARS. AND TOTALLY ELIMINATED WITHIN TEN YEARS. THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS EXCERPTED THE PROPOSAL. IT'S TOUGH FOR SOME ON DIVERSITY TO INTEGRATE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION INTO THE VISION OF SUCCESS DURING ITS MEETING HELD HERE IN RIVERSIDE. SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. AND IT ALSO ACCEPTED TO AUTHORIZE THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ADVOCATES CHANGES IN TITLE FIVE TO ENABLE US TO DO THAT. OBVIOUSLY SUCH FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WILL INEVITABLY REQUIRE INCREASED RESOURCES. OUR STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THESE INTRACTABLE PROBLEM INCLUDES TO INCREASE OUR **** OF THE CULTURAL COMPETENCIES. TO ENHANCE OUR COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A CULTURE OF EQUITY MINDEDNESS. AND TO DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTY HIRING. IT IS THEREFORE BE SHOOTING THAT THIS HEARING. IS BEING CONDUCTED A DRIVER'S SIDE CITY COLLEGE. IT IS A RARE PRIVILEGE AND PLEASURE FOR ME TO INTRODUCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOSE MAYOR.

SO AS WE CAN IN THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY. THIS IS THE THIRD THIRD ONE OF THE HEARINGS ON DIVERSITY I HAD FIRST THE ONE WITH THE UC CAMPUS AND THEN ONE WITH CSU AND NOW THIS THIRD ONE HERE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT IS EIGHT SOMETHING CLOSE TO MY HEART. AS A LIFELONG TEACHER COMMITTED TO ALL STUDENTS FOR MAKING SURE SUCCESS ALL STUDENTS SUCCEED STUDENTS WILL NOT SUCCEED UNLESS WE GET TO A POINT WHERE THE FACULTY REFLECTS THE POPULATION. AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FOR ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND- AND HERE OF HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD THAT IT IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY AND ALSO TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO I WANT TO EXTEND IT THANK YOU TO RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR HOSTING US A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO CHANCER ESAU. PRESIDENT ANDERSON PRESIDENT OF RCC MEDI SAY YEAGER WHO I BELIEVE IS NOT WITH US TODAY ENGINE NOW WORKMEN. AND THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. A NOTE THAT THIS HEARING IS LIVE STREAM AND WILL BE ARCHIVED IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE. ADDITIONALLY THE MATERIALS DISCUSS AND HANDED OUT TODAY CAN BE FOUND ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE. AT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS COMMITTEE HELD A OVERSIGHT HEARING TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION TO HOW TO INCREASE FAST FACULTY DIVERSITY IN ALL THREE SEGMENTS SYSTEM WIDE. PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS- END UCC ISSUE AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS HEARING IS A FOLLOW UP BUT WILL FOCUS SOLELY ON THE FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. RESEARCH SHOWS WHAT WE KNOW THAT A DIVERSE FACULTY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUCCESS OF A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY AND IMPROVES THE OVERALL CAMPUS CLIMATE. YET AS A CHANCER POINTED OUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF DIVERSITY AMONG THE FACULTY AT AMERICA'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BLACK AND LATINO FACULTY ARE PARTICULARLY UNDER REPRESENTED. THE PART TIME AND FULL TIME FACULTY RANKS. THE PERCENTAGE OF UN REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS HOWEVER HAS CONTINUED TO GROW STEADILY. NEVER THE LESS DESPITE NUMEROUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRESS TO INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF FEMALE AND UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY HAS BEEN SLOW. IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT THE ASSEMBLY SUCCESSIVELY ADVOCATED FOR SIX MILLION DOLLARS TWO MILLION DOLLARS EACH FOR THE U. S. C. YES YOU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SUPPORT WHEN PLAYING BEST PRACTICES AND TO REPORT ON THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC AND GENDER COMPOSITION. OF FACULTY. THIS HEARING WILL REVIEW THE STATUS OF FACULTY DIVERSIFICATION EFFORTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE CRISTINA GARCIA WHO WILL BE JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT. TO LEARN HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS USE THESE FUNDS TO ADDRESS FACULTY DIVERSITY SYSTEM WIDE AND TO LEARN OF SOME OF THE CAMPUS IS BEST. EFFORTS AS WELL. TO NOTE LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON THE TOPIC COVERING THE UC. THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION THIS COMMAND COMMITTEE WILL CONVENE AN OVERSIGHT HEARING. ON THE SAME TOPIC FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. LASTLY THIS IS A BUSY TIME FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW SEVERAL WANTED TO ATTEND THIS HEARING BUT HAD. PRIOR COMMITMENTS. SOME LEGISLATORS- AND BILLY WILL BE SENDING THEIR STAFF- NOT SURE THAT I SEE RACHEL- GONZAGA HERE YET THIS MORNING FROM. SHE'S HERE THERE'S IS RACHEL. RACHEL FROM ASSEMBLY WOMAN SABRINA CERVANTES AND JACQUI ESCOBAR- AND SHE JACQUI ALSO HEAR FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IS OFFICE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BOTH OF YOU. SO ON THE FIRST PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AND THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE. OUR FIRST SPEAKERS TODAY WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AND THE CURRENT LEGAL LANDSCAPE SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO BRING UP AND WELCOME- THE FIRST PANEL. BEGINNING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF PHIL HILL COLLEGE. TWEET T. WHEN N. MICHELLE SEE KETTLES PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WELCOME BOTH AND THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US HERE THIS MORNING. YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. MORNING ALSO TO CHANCE THIRTY SOUTH OF PRESIDENT A ANDERSON MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND ALSO MEANT THAT THE VIEWING PUBLIC MY NAME WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF FOOTHILL COLLEGE AND ALL I COME TO YOU- BECAUSE OF MY ROLE IN TERMS OF MY BACKGROUND AS A DESEGREGATION LAWYER ALL HAVING ALSO SERVED AS THE INTRO AND A GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALONG WITH BEING A COLLEGE PRESIDENT AND SEEN SOME OF THE WORK OF DIVERSIFYING OUR FACULTY AT PLAY- I WILL FOLLOW A LITTLE BIT OF- THE- POWER POINT PRESENTATION THAT I THAT IS IN YOUR PACKET. BUT I WOULD FIRST OF ALL WANTED THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LASER FOCUS ATTENTION ON FACULTY DIVERSITY- I KNOW WE HAVE DONE- ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRAM- AND IDEAS- ACCEPT OR AROUND THE STATE IN THE STATE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AROUND OF RACIAL EQUITY- IN CLOSING THE RACIAL EQUITY GAS. AND FACULTY DIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING STRATEGIES IF NOT DE PROMISING STRATEGY THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF RACE AND DIRECTLY. ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF THE RACIAL EQUITY. AND SO THIS IS IF ANYTHING THE MOST I IN MY EYES THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO FOCUS ON AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP TO FOCUS ON IT IT IS. IMPORTANT FROM SO MANY ANGLES BUT MOSTLY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS EQUITY AND THE RESEARCH AS YOU MENTION IS SHOWN AND I LIKE TO GO TO OVER THAT RESEARCH A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. AND THAT IS THAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS OF A DIVERSE FACULTY NOW WE'VE SEEN A SURGE IN HIGHER ED IN OTHER SYSTEMS IN K. TWELVE- BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY EVEN RESEARCH IN A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND THAT IS A RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT DE ANZA COLLEGE WHO IS ACTUALLY CONDUCTED BY A AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR. UC SANTA CRUZ AND HE WAS COMING TO DENOUNCE THE TO JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR DATA TO TAKE A LOOK AT ACTUALLY ISSUES OF POVERTY AND WORK FORCE AND WHETHER IT WAS CREATED SOCIAL MOBILITY. AND IN HIS DATA ANALYSIS HE DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT HE HADN'T INTENDED TO DISCOVER AND THAT WAS THAT WHEN STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT BY FACULTY OF COLOR. THE RACIAL EQUITY GAP- WAS PARTICULARLY STUDENT SUCCESS A DATA CLOSES ANY CLOSES FROM NINETEEN TO FIFTY ONE PERCENT- AND THAT IS NOT NEW NEWS TO US BUT WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW MUCH- THE DATA WAS VERY. SPECIFIC AND VERY FOCUSED AND PARTICULARLY FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE IF WE ARE ABLE. ACTUALLY IS A CLOSURE FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN TERMS OF EQUITY THAT'S WHY THIS FOCUS IS SO CRITICAL- SO THE RESEARCHER ASK QUESTIONS LIKE DO UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS PERFORM BETTER IN KHÔNG CLASSES TAUGHT BY MINORITY INSTRUCTORS. DO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS DO BETTER IN CLASSES TAUGHT BY AFRICAN AMERICAN INSTRUCTORS SO HE WAS ALSO EVEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE RACE TO RACE DYNAMIC- DO LATINO STUDENTS TO BETTER IN COURSES TAUGHT BY LATINO INSTRUCTORS AND HOW MUCH. DOES THIS REPRESENT IN TERMS OF DOING BETTER AND SO IN THE- PRESENTATION YOU'LL SEE SOME REALLY QUICK SNAPSHOTS OF HOW HE SAW JUST PEER DATA. PEER DATA ANALYSIS THAT HE SAW GAPS CLOSING AND THIS IS HIS CONCLUSION STRONG POSITIVE REAL BUS MINORITY INTERACTION EFFECTS FOR ALL OUTCOMES EXAM. INCLUDING LONG TERM OUTCOMES WHAT HE'S ALSO NOTICED THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE TAUGHT. BY A CHEMISTRY FACULTY OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO EVEN MAJOR IN CHEMISTRY. AND SOLD THAT ALSO IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY- HE SAW PARTICULARLY STRONG RACE OF RACE OWN OWN RACE INTERACTIONS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAVING THE HIGHEST- OF PERFORMANCE WHEN TAUGHT BY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. FACULTY ALTHOUGH EVEN LATINO STUDENTS WERE PERFORMING VERY WELL IT TAUGHT BY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY AND SO THE INTERACTION OF RACE IS ACTUALLY QUITE EXTRANET NOW. I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THIS DATA BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE KEY TWELVE DATA IT ALSO SHOWS THAT IN FACT WHEN A FACULTY OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY TEACHES- DE ELLAS STUDENT SUCCESS RATE INCREASES FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING. CAUCASIAN STUDENTS SO QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND WHAT HE SAW WAS. THERE WAS THIS ROLE MODEL AFFECT IT. NOT LIKE THE FACULTY OF COLLEGE ANYTHING DIFFERENT. THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT BUT IT'S HOW THE STUDENTS SOLVE THE FACULTY AND THE ROLE MODEL AFFECT THAT CAME WITH THAT- THE FULL ARTICLE IS ALSO IN THE PRESENTATION. AND THEN IT REALLY QUICKLY THERE IS NO DOUBT DIVERSEY ALSO HELPS IMPROVE THE TEAM SO THE FUNCTION OF THE COLLEGE AS A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TEAM WORK AS THEY SAY MAKES THE DREAM WORK RIGHT BUT TEAM WORK IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF INNOVATION. NEW PERSPECTIVES FRESHNESS OF IT IDEAS BEING ABLE TO SAY THINGS THAT MAYBE OTHERS WOULD SAY. THAT IS FROM DIVERT. ALL TYPES OF DIVERSITY BUT ALSO RACIAL DIVERSITY AND SO THERE IS A STUDY BY MACKENZIE THAT SHOWS EVEN RACIAL AND GENDER DIVERSE THE HELP COMPANIES WITH THEIR BOTTOM LINE- AND SO THAT IS WORTH WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT TO. L. SO THEN IF WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR STUDENTS THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO IT X. SPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF LEGAL. PARAMETERS AND CONSTRUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND WE KNOW THAT WHAT PROP TWO WILL NINE SAYS IN TERMS OF A PROHIBITION AGAINST PREFERENCE BASED ON RACE AND GENDER. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THIS WORK IT'S TWO SIDES OF THE KIDS SAME POINT I OFTEN DESCRIBE IT TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. SO ONE SIDE PROHIBITS YOU FROM DISCRIMINATION EVEN BEFORE PROP TILL NINE THERE WAS ALREADY NON DISCRIMINATION LAWS. RIGHT BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL FAIR SHAKE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR RACE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR GENDER. HE IN THE HIRING EMPLOYMENT PROCESS AND SO- IN HERE IT ALSO SPEAKS TO A LITTLE BIT OF THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE AROUND A DIVERSE WORKFORCE- IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT TITLE FIVE. AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF UP IN THE REGULATIONS AROUND HAVING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE SO THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR OUR LAWS HAVE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REFLECT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN THAT IS THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR TRAINING. AND SPECIFICALLY OUR REGULATIONS EVEN REQUIRE TRAININGS AROUND IN PLACE HI YES- AND THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK IS ALSO ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT FOLKS NEED TO FOCUS ON- THE NOTION OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. AND MORE TO COME ON THAT. DURING MY TIME AT THE STATE CHAMBERS OFFICE I DID WRITE A LEGAL OPINION. AROUND EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT IF BUT NOT WHAT YOU CAN'T DO BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO. TO INSURE RACIAL DIVERSITY AND SO FOLKS CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT MEMEL BUT AT THE. END OF THE MUMBLE PARTICULARLY POINTS OUT. AN ANALYTICAL PATHWAY. AND I ASKED THE STATE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ANALYTICAL PATHWAY BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT FOR INSTANCE THE NOTION OF ADVERSE IMPACT. IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT WE CALL THE FOUR FIFTHS RULE WHICH IS THE 8020% RULE IT'S AN ANALYTICAL WAY TO KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE. POSSIBLE RACIAL IMPACTS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE EMPLOYMENT OF PROCESS SO I THINK IT'S WORTH A SPECIALLY AS WE GET MORE SOPHISTICATED. IN THE WORK OF FACULTY DIVERSITY HIRING OF YOU KNOW I THINK OUR SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS- IS VERY COMMITTED A TO THE NOTION OF FACULTY DIVERSITY I THINK OUR SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS COMMITTED FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT. OF FACULTY DIVERSITY BUT WE DO NEED TO GET SOPHISTICATED AROUND THE WORK BECAUSE WE ARE GOING AGAINST POSSIBLE IMPLICIT BIAS- AND THE LIKE- AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM AN ANALYTICAL STANDPOINT. AND LASTLY JUST A QUICK COLLEGE PRESIDENT PERSON. AND TO SOME EXTENT- A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- THERE IS THIS NOTION CALLED A TEST CALL THE IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TESTS. I THINK WE REALLY TO GET SOPHISTIC SAID IT'S AN ABILITY TO TEST ANONYMOUSLY WHETHER ONE HAS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WITH REGARDS TO RACE. AND THIS SHOULD BE REALLY TAUGHT BECAUSE IF IT'S UNCONSCIOUS EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU ARE YES I'M AWARE I'M AND CON I HAVE A CONSCIOUS BIAS. YES OUR SOCIETY IS WORKING A RAN AGAINST SYSTEM LIST OF OPPRESSION AND PARTICULARLY AROUND RACISM. I'LL BUT WHAT CAN I DO. THE NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS THAT KNOWING IS NOT ENOUGH JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT ENOUGH YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE STEPS TO LOWER YOUR INDIVIDUAL BIAS. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY ALSO STRATEGIES ON HOW TO LOWERED THAT BIAS ON A DAILY BASIS YOU ALMOST HAVE TO WORK- AGAINST YOUR. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TO BE ABLE TO LOWER THAT BIAS. THE LONGITUDINAL DATA TO MENTION TO YOU I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO GET SOPHISTICATED AROUND THIS WORK AND THE NOTION THAT THE EMPLOYMENT HIRING AND THE STUDENT EQUITY PLAN SHOULD ACTUALLY BE INTEGRATED WE SHOULD SEAT BECAUSE- IN ORDER TO CLOSE TO STUDENT EQUITY GAP WE NEED FACULTY DIVERSITY. AND SO THEREFORE FAULTY DIVERSITY IS A STRATEGY IN STUDENT EQUITY WORK AND THEREFORE IT NEEDS TO BE INTEGRATED IN THAT WAY IT SHOULD BE TWO HOUSES IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO PLANTS- THE OTHER IS ALSO I SUBMIT TO YOU WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER PART TIME FACULTY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON TIME FACULTY HIRING BUT THE PART TIME FACULTY HIRING HAS ACTUALLY BEEN- UNDER THE RADAR SO TO SPEAK AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ATTENTION AROUND THAT HIRING A PART TIME FACULTY ALSO IN OUR SYSTEM- AND- I KNOW OUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REQUEST FOR FUNDING. I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AS WE BRING MORE PEOPLE ON THE BUS THAT'S WHERE THE STRATEGIES OF ALL THIS WORK COULD BE VERY IMPACTFUL. AND LASTLY I WANTED THANK YOU ONE OF THE TWELVE STRATEGIES TO LOWER IMPLICIT BIAS BASED RESEARCH IS THAT WE MONITOR. IMPLICIT BIAS WHEN YOU PUT PEOPLE UNDER A WHAT IS ON FMRI TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE BIASED GOES UP. IF YOU TELL THEM THAT I AM MONITORING YOU FOR IMPLICIT BIAS THE PIE IS GOES DOWN. AND SO THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO MONITOR. SYSTEM Y. EIGHT WIDE THE WORK THAT WE DO AS ALLEGE PRESIDENTS TO MONITOR COLLEGE WIDE IS CRITICAL TO ACTUALLY LOWERING. IMPLICIT BIAS ITSELF SO PLEASE KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT AND THE. MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AFTERNOON- GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEDINA- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YOU FOR GIVING ME A CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY THE- AREA SHARE WITH YOU- OUR THOUGHTS ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO PRESIDENT WHEN WHO I THINK CAPTURED- IT PERFECTLY BY. SAYING IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR STUDENTS AND I THINK EVERY TIME WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION THAT IT SHOULD. BE THE GUIDING LIGHT THAT CENTERS ALL OUR WORK. I'M MICHELLE SEE KATO'S I'M PRESIDENT AT THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY OR SOLE FOCUS AND MISSION IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO GO TO COLLEGE. ENSURE THAT WINSTON ONCE THEY GET TO COLLEGE WHETHER IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE A CAL STATE OR YOU SEE. THAT THEY REACH THEIR COLLEGE GOALS AND GRADUATE. AND WITHIN THAT. MISSION AT OUR VERY HEART AND CENTER IS ENSURING EQUITY AND CLOSING OF THE PERSISTENT. INEQUITABLE HIGHER EDUCATION- GAPS THAT EXIST. IN ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. LAST YEAR AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE RELEASED A GROUND BEEF GROUND BREAKING REPORT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RACIAL AND GENDER INCLUSION IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WHY IT MATTERS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS THE REPORT ANALYZED- STUDENT DIVERSITY FACULTY DIVERSITY SENIOR LEADERSHIP DIVERSITY- AND THE DIVERSITY OF ACADEMIC SENATE'S- MANY OF YOU CAN FIND THIS REPORT IT'S CALLED LEFT OUT HOW INCLUSION IN CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HURTS OUR VALUES OUR STUDENTS AND OUR ECONOMY. AND ONLINE YOU CAN LOOK UP ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAL STATE ARE YOU SEE CAMPUS AND ACTUALLY SEE- DIVERSITY NUMBERS FOR THE STUDENT POPULATION AND ALL THE OTHER GROUPS THAT I JUST SHARED WITH YOU. ONE ONLY NEEDS TO REALLY SET FOOT IN ANY ONE OF OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO SEE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS- 69% OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. THAT NUMBER IS ONLY GOING TO GROW AS WE HAVE OVER TWELVE SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS IS SO CRITICAL AND IMPOSE OUR REPORT AND OUR RESEARCH AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT BEFORE YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISING. ALTHOUGH OUR STUDENTS ARE DIVERSE OUR FACULTY CERTAINLY ARE NOT ALTHOUGH OUR STUDENTS ARE DIVERT OUR ACADEMIC SENATE'S ARE NOT. ALTHOUGH OUR STUDENTS ARE DIVERSE OUR LEADERSHIP IS NOT. TODAY I WILL HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THESE NUMBERS FOR YOU I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THE DATA COLLECTED WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE DATA I REFER TO AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARIES THAT YOU WERE PROVIDED EARLIER. BUT I ALSO WANT TO START FROM A REALLY PERSONAL PLACE AS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AS A FIRST AND STUDENT WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY CAMPUS PITZER COLLEGE NOT TOO FAR FROM HEARING. ON'T NOT THAT FAR FROM THE DIVERSE LOS ANGELES I GREW UP IN NOT THAT FAR FROM THE DIVERSE HIGH SCHOOL I ATTENDED- BUT IT WAS PRETTY STRIKING TO BE ON A CAMPUS WHERE I WAS ONE OF VERY FEW- STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND AS A FIRST GEN STUDENT IT WAS CRITICAL FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SEE- MYSELF AS BELONGING THERE AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL IN THE RESEARCH THAT YOU FIND ABOUT FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS- A SENSE OF BELONGING WILL MAKE IT OR BREAK IT FOR STUDENT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY SUCCEED OR NOT. SO WHETHER THEY HAVE ROLE MODELS PEOPLE INVESTED IN THEM- AND EVEN JUST PEOPLE THEY CAN LOOK AT WHEN THEY SHOW UP IN CLASSES THAT. MAY SHARE THEIR SAME EXPERIENCE WE WANT TO SEE OURSELVES IN THE FOLKS IN FRONT OF US AND WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES WE SEE THAT THE INSTITUTION VALUES ARE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT HIRES PEOPLE THAT COME FROM OUR EXPERIENCE- WE KNOW THAT WE ARE VALUED BECAUSE WE ARE REPRESENTED- ALL HUMAN CONNECTION STARTS WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING SOMETHING IN COMMON. AND. LIVING IN A DIVERSE STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. THE FIND IN COMMON TO A VARIETY OF THINGS BUT ALL STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM HAVING DIVERSE FACULTY SO I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHILE IT'S POWERFUL FOR FIRST CHEN. STUDENTS OF COLOR TO SEE FACULTY OF COLOR THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THAT REFLECT THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR WHITE STUDENTS TO HAVE WHITE STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE LET NEXT FACULTY. AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY ASIAN AMERICAN FACULTY SO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR A DIVERSE CALIFORNIA AND A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT WE ALL LIVE IN. SO GIVING GIVEN THE GROWING DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY- IMPORTANT TO DO THIS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS. OFTENTIMES I THINK YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH OUR STATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION REPORTS WHICH LOOK AT STUDENTS HOW MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE THERE THAT ARE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE HOW MANY GO TO COLLEGE WE HAVE A STATE OF HIGHER ED REPORT FOR LOT NEXT. STATE OF HIGHER ED REPORT FOR BLACK STUDENTS. HAD REPORT FOR ASIAN AMERICAN. AND HOPEFULLY IN THE COMING YEAR YOU'LL SEE A STATE OF HIGHER ED REPORT FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS WE DO THOSE REPORTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT INSTITUTION SHOULD CARE ABOUT HOW THEY BETTER PREPARE. AND SUPPORT STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND. AND ARE INTENTIONAL IN THAT WAY AS WE DID THOSE REPORTS WE REALIZE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PUT AMERICA ON PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL. TO SEE HOW IS NOT JUST THE DIVERSITY OF THE INCOMING STUDENT BODY AND WHAT THEIR SUCCESS RATES ARE BUT WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY IN REPRESENTATION EXIST IN OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. SO AS I SHARED EARLIER IN SPITE OF REALLY BROAD DIVERSITY WE HAVE OVER TWO POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PUBLIC. IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALONE TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. RIGHT 14% OR ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER AND 6% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. YET DESPITE THAT RICH DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENT BODY WE HAVE A TRUE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN BOTH TENURED AND NON. TENURED FACULTY POSITIONS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS YOU CAN. THE HAND OUT THE STE. NO THE TENURED FACULTY COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE 61% WHITE. 15% MONEX ONLY 10% ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER 6% AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE STORY OF NON TENURED FACULTY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT PERCENT FROM TENURED FACULTY ARE 13% LOT NEXT 11% ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND 5% AFRICAN AMERICAN. I LIKE TO SHARE BOTH TENURED AND NON TEN BECAUSE- OFTEN YOU WILL HEAR THAT THE INCOMING PIPELINE OF FACULTY IS MORE DIVERSE THE DATA WE ANALYZED DOES NOT. PROVE THAT TO BE ACCURATE AND I THINK PRESIDENT WHEN- MENTIONED THAT IN HER COMMENTS IF THE PIPELINE IS NON TENURED FACULTY AND THAT PIPELINE IS ACTUALLY EITHER AS- LACKING IN DIVERSITY AS ARE TENURED FACULTY- HOW ARE WE GOING TO PRODUCE IN ANY NEAR FUTURE- DIVERSE REFLECTIVE. REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. RACIAL INEQUITIES IN FACULTY REPRESENTATION ARE FURTHER COMPOUNDED IN REPRESENTATION AT ACADEMIC SENATE'S FOR CAMPUSES AND FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF THIS IS CONCERNING GIVEN THE ROLE ACADEMIC SENATE'S PLAY AN ESTABLISHING POLICIES WHICH CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY STUDENTS OF COLOR TO ACCESS AND THRIVE AT COLLEGES. IN YOUR PACKET YOU WILL ALSO FIND BRIEF THAT LOOKS AT AND TATIAN OF CAMPUS AND SYSTEMWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE'S ACADEMIC SENATE'S ARE AMONG THOSE CRITICAL LEADERSHIP BODIES THAT EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES POWERS AND ALLEGES ACROSS. ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CERTAINLY TRUE ALSO AT OUR CS YOU WHEN YOU SEE. ONE EXAMPLE OF ACADEMIC DECISION MAKING IS ANY CURRENT DEGREE CHANGES FOR INSTANCE CHANGES TO COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR A MAJOR MUST BE APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE ANY PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A NEW MAJOR OR TO DISCONTINUE A MAJOR MUST BE APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AND WE SEE ACADEMIC SENATE'S AFFAIRS AT THE CSU PUSHING FOR NEW ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS THAT AS MOST OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW WE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE IN POSITIONS TO INFLUENCE ACADEMIC POLICY SO SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCES OF THE STUDENTS THE IMPACT. IT AGAIN WE SEE A MISMATCH A REPRESENTATION BETWEEN WHO SITS ON THE BODIES AND THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE. 72% OF CAMPUS ACADEMIC SENATE MEMBERS ARE WHITE. 14% OUR LAND NEXT 7% ARE ASIAN AMERICAN NAY WHY AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AND ONLY 5% ARE AFRICAN. THE ONE BRIGHT NOTE OUR RESEARCH DID FIND WAS THAT THERE WAS GREATER GENDER EQUITY AND REPRESENTATION ESPECIALLY A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BETWEEN STUDENTS AND FACULTY. MORE THAN HALF OF OUR STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE 53% ARE FEMALE. AND WOMEN ARE AT OR ABOVE REPRESENTATIONAL EQUITY IN TEN YEAR TO NON TENURED FACULTY POSITIONS AND WITHIN THE ACADEMIC SENATE 54% OF TENURED FACULTY ARE FEMALE FIFTY AND 53% OF NON TENURED FACULTY ARE FEMALE. WE OFTEN HEAR THE PEOPLE APPRECIATE AND WANT DIVERSITY HOWEVER AS THIS DATA SHOWS AND I THINK AS THE CHANCELLOR- OPENED WE OFTEN JUST GIVE LIP SERVICE TO THAT COMMENT. I'M WE'VE COMPLETELY TOLERATED THE ABSENCE OF DIVERSITY AMONGST OUR FACULTY AND LEADERSHIP THAT OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS CHAIR MEDINA YOU HAVE RIGHTLY LAMENTED THESE CHALLENGES AND THAT CHANGE IS NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH. WE HOPE THAT TODAY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BRING FOR THEIR ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO URGENTLY MAKE AN ACADEMIC SENATE POSITIONS MORE INCLUSIVE. BUT ALSO IDENTIFY PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS TOWARDS THAT END SO WE OFFER SOME ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT WE THINK YOU CAN HELP MOVE FORWARD. FIRST OBVIOUSLY THE STATE NEEDS TO COMMIT TO RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH ITS OWN POLICY AND BUDGETARY ACTIONS. THE STATE SHOULD SET SPECIFIC INTRACTABLE GOALS FOR IMPROVING FACULTY DIVERSITY AMONG OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. OTHERWISE WE LACK OF VISION FOR HOW WE EXPECT OUR INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE AND WILL ACCEPT INCREMENTAL CHANGE WHICH IS ALL WE'VE EVER GOTTEN. WE MUST ALSO BE PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE GOAL OF INCREASED RACIAL DIVERSITY AMONG FACULTY WILL TESTING RESOURCES FOR THAT PURPOSE AS YOU'VE DONE RECENTLY. INVESTMENT SHOULD COME WITH CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS AND METRICS IN EVALUATING EVALUATING VACANCY. RESOURCES ALONE ARE UNLIKELY TO YIELD THE DESIRED OUTCOMES WE WANT. WE NEED BETTER DATA AND TRANSPARENCY ON FACULTY AND LEADERSHIP REPRESENTATION BY RACE BY ETHNICITY AND BY GENDER MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND STREAMLINED AS WE GET THIS DATA SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MONITOR WHICH WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PRESIDENT WHEN ALSO SHE- THE STATE. SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH THE EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR ALL PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO REPORT ON THE RACIAL ETHNIC AND GENDER REPRESENTATION OF FACULTY BOTH TENURED AND NON TENURED. THEY ALREADY HAVE TO REPORT THAT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHY ARE WE COLLECTING IT FOR OUR STATE GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT ACADEMIC SENATE'S IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP REPORT THIS DATA. THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT IT. HOW ELSE CAN YOU MEASURE PROGRESS. AT A CAMPUS LEVEL CAMPUSES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH CAMPUS GOALS WITH SPECIFIC PLANS. AND MILESTONES FOR CLOSING RACIAL DIVERSITY GAPS AN INCREASING REPRESENTATION AMONG FACULTY AND CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RESEARCH AND PRACTICE LIKE THAT OF U. S. C. CENTER FOR URBAN EDUCATION THE CAMPUS IS ALSO NEED TO COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE THEIR HIRING PROCESS AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE ROLE OF HUMAN RESOURCES FROM THE CONTENT OF A POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE OUTRAGE THEY CONDUCT ON THOSE POSITION ANNOUNCEMENTS. TO CHANGING THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO REALLY PROBING FOR EQUITY MINDED COMPETENCIES BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE WANT DIVERSE PROFESSIONALS AT OUR CAMPUSES WE WANT EQUITY MINDED PROFESSIONALS AT OUR CAMPUSES. WE SHOULD BE ASKING FOR TEACHING DEMONSTRATIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PEDAGOGY. THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT USC AND DOCTOR STYLE OF AND SIMONE AND HER HER GROUP CAN REALLY PROVIDE ON THAT NOTE I ALSO JUST WANT TO- TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES THE LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED AROUND THE LIMITATIONS OF PROP TWO OH NINE- ARE USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING MORE DIVERSE ON CAMPUS. AND I WOULD LIKE US TO BE BRAVE AND BOLD TO FLIP THE QUESTION I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW SOME CAMPUSES CAN HAVE TWENTY OPEN POSITIONS FILL ALL TWENTY POSITIONS WITH ONLY WHITE FACULTY AND NOT BE THREATENED WITH THE CONCERN. THAT MAYBE THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST FACULTY OF COLOR SO INSTEAD OF ALWAYS FEELING LIKE WE HAVE TO DEFEND DIVERSITY I THINK CAMPUSES AND CAMPUS LEADERS SHOULD BE IN A POSITION TO DEFEND TO THEIR LACK OF DIVERSITY. THE WORK IS URGENT AND IMPORTANT AND I REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON PROCESS OF MAYBE THE FIRST ONE FOR BOTH OF YOU- IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF CLUSTER HIRING. I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS PRACTICE WITH WITHIN THE UC. WHICH HAS A GOAL OF- HIRING. THE GROUP OF PEOPLE PERHAPS ACROSS- SPECTRUM OF COMPETENCY USER DISCIPLINES. IF YOU COULD MAYBE SPEAK MORE ABOUT THAT IDEA OF CLUSTER HIRING AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M WELL FAMILIAR WITH THE CLOSER HIGH YOU WERE OF RATHER RECENTLY- AND I THINK IT'S WORTH- STUDY OF BID IF THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. ON NATIONALLY AROUND THAT AL AND I THINK IT'S WORTH ANALYZING OF FOR THREE REASONS ONE IT'S WORTH ANALYZING WHETHER THEY WERE ABLE TO. DO THAT WITHOUT VIOLATING PROP TWO OH NINE WHICH IS THE NEW WANTS OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND IS IT'S INTRIGUING. BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON AREAS OF NEED ALL ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND NEW FUNDING COMING IN FOR FACULTY HIRING. IS A AND SOMETIMES WE SEE THAT DIVERSITY RACIALLY- GROWING UP IS ACTUALLY IN THE AREAS OF FOR INSTANCE COUNSELING- BUT NOT IN AREAS OF STEM TEACHING. AND SO BEING ABLE TO DO CLOSER HIRING THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO CLUSTERS CERTAIN AREA LIKE STEM OF FOR INSTANCE OF IS INTRIGUING A AND IT'S WORTH OF FOCUS EXPRESSION KNOWING OR LACK OF DIVERSITY IN TOWN. SO IF IT WAS A CLUSTER HIGHER. IN INSTEAD IT IS THAT. IS TO SEE WHETHER IS A AND AGAIN THIS IS VERY NEW TO ME SO I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH WORTH IT WANTED TOWARD EXPORT WE SHOULD EXPLORE ALL STRATEGIES- BUT THEN ALSO TO SEE WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR OUR SYSTEM AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE WE HAVE. CONCEPTS OF FSA'S FACULTY SERVICE AREAS AND A WHAT IS THE ABILITY TO HIRE BROADLY OR NARROWLY WITHIN THAT THOSE CONFINES OF FACULTY AND OUR FACULTY LEADERSHIP- I THINK KNOWING THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED. IN AT LEAST TAKING A LOOK AND EXPLORING A WHAT THAT MEANS VIS A VIS THE WAY WERE STRUCTURE SO I DON'T KNOW AND I CANNOT DEFINITIVELY SAY IT'S A IT'S A RIGHT WAY TO GO BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH EXPLORING. MISHA ARE THE RESEARCH I'VE SEEN AS THE CLUSTER HIRING ISN'T REALLY STRATEGY I AGREE WITH AND ONE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH EXPLORING. YES ONE TOPIC THAT WE'VE NOT DISCUSSED IS THE REALITY THAT WHEN FACULTY THESE ARE NOT VERY DIVERSE AND YOU ONLY HIRE ONE FACULTY OF COLOR THEIR EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO WHAT AT FIRST AND STUDENT ARRIVING ON CAMPUS IS. AND SO IT CAN'T JUST BE ABOUT HIRING A DIVERSE POOL IT TO BE ABOUT CREATING UGH BUT ENVIRONMENT WHERE DIVERSE FACULTY OF COLOR FEEL SUPPORTED AND WELCOMED. AND I THINK CLUSTER HIRING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. THAT WAS AN ACTUALLY BE MY NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT PERSISTENCE PERSISTENCE OF FACULTY. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING THE ONLY ONE WOULD NOT. I HAD A I DO NOT THINK OF MAKE ONE YOU KNOW FEEL WE TALKED ABOUT THE SENSE OF BELONGING- AND THE SENSE OF. BEING PART OF THE CAMPUS AND PERHAPS THE IDEA OF A- CLUSTER HIRING WOULD WOULD HELP. IN THAT AS WELL. I IN A GOING BACK TO THE CLUSTER HIRING IN THE ISSUE OF- FACULTY THERE DIVERSE RACIALLY DIVERSE. RETENTION OF THE CHURCHES WITH AGAIN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LORI BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THINKING THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT. IS WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO HIRE LARGE NUMBERS OF FULL TIME FACULTY AND SO THE NOTION OF CLUSTER- IS LOGISTICALLY OF JUST PLAYING IT IN MY MIND. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK AN INFUSION OF MONEY TO THE SYSTEM TO HIRE NEW FACULTY- OTHERWISE RIGHT NOW IT'S A SCENARIO WHEN FACULTY LEAVE AND VACANCY STICKER. OF THE WITH THE NEW FUSION OF MONEY INTO NEW FACULTY HIRING WE MAY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE CLUSTER HIRING SO JUST- JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT. OF FACULTY OF THAT PARTICULAR- DIVERSE RACIALLY FACULTY OF- AND THEIR RETENTION IS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT NOTION WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. AND IN FACT THERE WAS A DISSERTATION THAT WAS DONE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY LA AT THE COLLEGES- IT ONE DISSERTATION OF THE YEAR AND IT SHOWED. OF THE ISOLATION THE FACULTY OF COLOR HALF AND MANY OF THEM IF THEY'RE NOT LEAVING- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND DECIDE TO STILL STAY BECAUSE OF THEIR LOVE FOR TEACHING. A MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP SO NOT INVOLVED IN THEIR LOCAL SENATE NOT INVOLVED IN HIRING PROCESS CEDAR CHESTS TEACHING AND FINING THAT LOVE TO THE TEACHING AND NOT SERVING THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY FEEL RACIALLY ISOLATED AND SO THE NOTION OF A IT'S NOT ABOUT RETENTION BUT REALLY TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE. OF THE RICH DIVERSITY THE FACULTY OF COLOR BRING TO A CAMPUS IT IS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE COLLEGE NOT TO ENSURE THAT FACULTY OF COLOR- FEEL WELCOME SUPPORTED VERSUS FEELING REYES. ISOLATED I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A POINT. IN THAT IS THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AT LEAST THE ONE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THE RATE THE RACIAL STUDENT EQUITY GAP NARAL BY NINETEEN TO FIFTY ONE PERCENT. BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. THAT MEANS THERE'S ABOUT ANOTHER HALF. THAT DOES NOT AT THE GAP HAS NOT CLOSE SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE BURDEN OF RACIAL EQUITY AND CLOSING THE RACIAL EQUITY GAFFER STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE BASED ENTIRELY. ON FACULTY OF COLOR THEY ARE DEFINITELY OF CRITICAL STRATEGY BUT IT IS FOR ALL FACULTY NO MATTER WHAT RACE THAT THEY MUST BE ENGAGED AROUND THE ISSUE OF STUDENT ACTIVITY AND AROUND CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS. AND AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS TOWARD EACH OTHER AND TOWARD STUDENTS SO IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF ALL NOT JUST FOR FACULTY OF COLOR. THE FIGURES THAT- WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US THAT THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY- HAS PROVIDED. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK- LOOKING AT NON TENURED FACULTY. I THINK I AM SURPRISED. THAT A THE LAST DIVERSITY WITH PART TIME FACULTY PURSES FULL TIME FACULTY. I AND I AND I WONDER IF OTHERS YOU KNOW MAY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AS I AM BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE POOL. THAT WE'RE DRYING FROM FOR PART TIME FACULTY. CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE MUCH BETTER. THEN THEN THE POOL FOR FULL TIME FACULTY SO IF BOTH OF YOU EITHER OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS WHY WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY WHY IS THE PART TIME FACULTY NUMBERS. ACTUALLY YES ACTUALLY SMALLER LESS DIVERSE THAN THE FULL TIME FACULTY. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY SURPRISING FOR US WHEN WE WERE DOING THE RESEARCH WE WERE TOLD BY SEVERAL. SEVERAL FACULTY ON CAMPUSES THAT WE NEEDED. YOU KNOW TAKE OUT TENURE TO NON TENURED- BECAUSE FACULTY WERE SAYING THAT IN FACT THE NON TENURED WERE LESS DIVERSE AND YET THE ARGUMENT WAS ALWAYS THIS IS A PIPELINE ISSUE RIGHT- AND SO THE PIPELINE WILL GET MORE DIVERSE IF WE JUST WAIT LONG ENOUGH- AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I THINK YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS ON CAMPUSES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT BETTER. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT CLEARLY THERE IS- BROKE IN HIRING AND VETTING PROCESS THAT ISN'T BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN A WAY THAT WOULD PRODUCE DIFFERENT NUMBERS ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE REPORT THAT WE TALK ABOUT BECAUSE OF A THE OTHER ARGUMENT IT'S OFTEN MADE AS WELL THERE ARE FEWER LET NEXT AND AFRICAN AMERICAN AND FOLKS WITH. YOU KNOW. ADVANCED DEGREES SO THE POOL IS SMALLER AND WHAT WE FIND IS WELL THE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PRODUCING A LOT OF GRADUATES THAT ARE. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO THAT EXCUSE DOESN'T HOLD VERY WELL AND IN THE UC WE SAY YOU SEE HAS A STUDENT BODY. WHERE THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP IS ASIAN AMERICAN AND YET THEY HAVE- A HUGE GAP IN REPRESENTATION AMONGST FACULTY FOR THEIR STUDENTS- AND WE ARE PRODUCING. A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICAN GRADUATES SO THE ARGUMENT DOESN'T HOLD IF YOUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN. IF YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T CARE ABOUT DIVERSITY AN ACT IN A VERY REAL AN INTENTIONAL WAY IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO REPRODUCE. THESE HIRING COMMITTEES ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW- LOOK LIKE THEM. OFTENTIMES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY VALUE AS EXPERIENCE WITH THE VALUE AS- YOU KNOW QUALITY RESEARCH IF THAT'S THE CASE FOR YOU SEE PROFESSOR EXCITER. I FIVE EIGHT A FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CAMPAIGN AND TO THE AIR FOR FOCUSING ON THE PART TIME FACULTY AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A RAPIDLY. A REALLY CRITICAL AREA FOR A STUDENT THEY MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PART TIME AND FULL TIME FACULTY YOU'RE MY FACULTY. AND SO OF FROM A STUDENT PERSPECTIVE WE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT- I CAN TAKE SO MUCH IN THIS AREA BUT I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT WITH ONE BIG PICTURE. PART TIME FACULTY HIGHER IS VERY FORMAL. MORE SO THAN FULL TIME FACULTY HIGHER. OF FULL TIME FACULTY HIGHER THE TRAINING THERE'S A COMMITTEE OF THEIR MUCH MORE FORMALITY IN THE HIRING THE FULL TIME FACULTY. VERSUS PART TIME FACULTY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE AN INFORMAL PROCESS SEES ARE OUT OF COLLEGE- AROUND TOP PART TIME FACULTY HIRE ANY SPECIALLY THE PRESSURE POINTS OF QUICKLY FINDING. OF PART TIME FACULTY TO FILL ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS DOCKS WHERE MUCH OF THE ISSUE OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMES INTO PLAY SOME JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT THERE'S. SO MUCH TO UNPACK AROUND THE TIME FACULTY HIRING. THANK YOU I TOOK ON THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN DO- COMMITMENT SETTING GOALS- COMMITTEE RESOURCES- INVESTMENT A DATA. AND THE NUMBER FOUR DOWN I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT- THE PROCESS MASSES OF HIGHER HUMAN RESOURCES THE QUESTIONS THAT. AND AN EIGHT ONE UPS SAID ON THAT ONE FOR A LITTLE BIT. AS IT AS IT IS YOU KNOW MY WIFE IS A HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGER. WORKED FOR A FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANY FOR MANY YEARS. AND AS WE SPOKE BEFORE THIS- HEARING THIS MORNING AS WE SPOKE YESTERDAY. I REALLY FEEL THAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THE PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER THAN WE ARE DOING AS A STATE AS WE ARE DOING IN THE THREE SYSTEMS. AND SO IT MAKES ME WONDER HEAR YOU KNOW DESCRIPTION ABOUT. THE BIAS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY- THE VERY TRUE AND WANTED TO ALLEVIATE THAT AGAIN I AM ROOM THE FIRST HEARING THAT WE HAD. HEARD FROM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. AFRICAN AMERICAN PROFESSOR I BELIEVE IN ASTRONOMY FROM BERKELEY WOULD BEEN THERE MANY YEARS. AND HE SAID WE DO NOT HAVE A MORE. FACULTY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO AND THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR DISCUSSED ABOUT INFORMALITY OF THE- HIGH TIMES HIGHER. OF YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE. DO WORRY ME QUITE A BIT AND HERE WE ARE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I MEAN. ALL OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS. STRUCK AND STILL. THE DATA YOU KNOW FIFTY NINE PERCENT STUDENTS OF COLOR. YOU KNOW MAYBE 20% FACULTY OF COLOR. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER WE HAVE TO DO BETTER FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU SAID YOU KNOW FOR THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS FOR THE- REST OF THE. HOPE THAT IN THIS CONTINUE. YOU CAN DO THAT. ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE IN CLOSING. I JUST REALLY QUICKLY. YOUR WIFE AND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I DON'T WANT COMPLETELY LOST IT TOO MUCH THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IT IS TRUE THEY ARE. SIX RATHER MORE SOPHISTICATED. MANY OF THE GOOD COMPANIES NOW DOING BLIND- TO LOWER IMPLICIT BIAS THE BUT THE REDACT OUT AND HAVE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO DO SO IT'S SOMETHING MAYBE WE SHOULD. FOR IN THE TV COLLEGES AROUND THE SYSTEM UP. GETTING SOPHISTICATED MANY OF THEM IS BECAUSE- MACKENZIE REPORT A 35% INCREASE IN REVENUE TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SO THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS SMART FOR BUSINESS AND I THINK AS LONG AS WE STAY FOCUSED ON THIS IS SMART FOR STUDENTS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK. FOR A JOINT TODAY YOUR SURE AND. OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WANTING TO DO THAT BY THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU BOTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE. YOUR CAMPUS. FOR PATIENTS TODAY. SO OUR SECOND PANEL WHAT HAS THE SYSTEM ACCOMPLISH SINCE THE HEARING OF OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AND AT THIS TIME WE WILL TRANSITION WE WILL FOCUS ON A SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGE OF IMPROVING FACULTY DIVERSITY I PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HEARING AN UPDATE RE HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE USE THE TWO DOLLARS. MAJOR OKAY FACULTY AND WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME DAISY DR DAYS AGO ALICE DEPUTY CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CANCERS. WELCOME DOCTOR GONZALEZ.

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO SHARE WITH YOU. AN UPDATE ON THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TASK FORCE. ARE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ON NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. ON BEHALF OF CANCER OAKLEY I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING ALL OF OUR STATE WHAT STATE HER PARTNERS WHO HIGHER HAVE BEEN IN. TOLL SETTING PRESS. OF INSTITUTIONS IT IS NOT EASY WORK AND EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THINKING THAT FOR COLLEGE UNITY FOR THEIR REPORT. NUMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE PART OF THE REPORT BOARD OF GOVERNORS. AND IT WAS THAT REPORT THAT INSPIRED OR BOARD TO TAKE ACTION- IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WILL SHARE A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT I SPECIFICALLY THE- JOHN STAND. I HIM HE JOIN ME AS THE CO CHAIR OF THE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION TASK FORCE NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO. AND THEN OF COURSE IT I THINK ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. WHO SENT REPRESENTATIVES FROM AFRO. I'M AS WELL AS LEAGUE CEOS INTEREST THESE AND YOU HAVE ONE OF THEM IN YOUR PANEL LATER ON TODAY DOCTOR MIGHT FORGET SCEA. FOLLOWING ALONG ON TIME USE THE POWER POINT AND I AM ON. I WANT TO BEGIN FIRST BY SAYING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THAT TWO THOUSAND AND SIX NO PORTION. THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO OUR OFFICE WAS PROVIDED TO DISTRICTS. SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY. SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS ARE AT THE TIME SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT. JUST TO ALLOWED OUR OFFICE TO USE 25% OF IT TO OPERATE WHAT WE OF THE CCC REGISTRY. WITH WEBSITE OPERATE. WHERE ARE JOB POSTINGS ARE PROVIDED THAT IS WHERE MOST RECRUITMENT CAN HAPPEN. SINCE THAT TIME WE ALSO. IS THE FUN PART UNDERSTAND THEIR LOT. INFORMATION INFORMATION IS AN INSIDE AND AN INSIGHT BECOMES AN ACTION SO WE DID STATEWIDE WORKSHOPS ALL AROUND THE STATE AND THE- PACIFIC. WE SET OUT TO REALLY RECREATED IN. STOP AND THAT IS THE WORK OF THE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION TASK FORCE AND I WOULD LIKE TO. PHONE YOU ABOUT THAT WORK. TELL YOU THAT INITIALLY WORK BEGAN OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS WANTED US TO SET A VERY SPECIFIC GOAL AMERICAL GOAL IS ATTACHED TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. GETTING IT FROM THE SYSTEM FOR MORE LAWYERS. FROM MAKING A GOAL. ULTIMATELY INTEGRATING DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION INTO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO- AND THAT WAS ONLY DONE AFTER WE ANALYZE YES WHAT PRIVATE WORK SITES HAD DONE AS WELL AS WORTH IT AND IN OTHER SEGMENTS IN STATE AND LOOKING AT OTHER BEING TO. THE ONE IN YOUR- SET OUT TO. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. IN ADDITION TO THAT. STATEWIDE STRUCTURAL CHANGES WERE THIS IS ABOUT. CHANGE PLEASE WAIT WHAT POLICIES WHAT IS WHAT DO WE NEED TO CHANGE AND NOT IS WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU ON THIS OUR POINT. I THINK IT'S AN FOR TO LOOK AT THIS WITH A HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT POSITION. NINE TWO THOUSAND AND- LET. TOO MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS IN COLLEGES WERE VERY VIEWS THEY BELIEVE THAT PROP TWO OH NINE ELIMINATED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS. AN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT WE SAW A DEEP CONCERN FROM THE CONSULTATION. AND THEIR QUEST THE DOT A TASK FORCE BE CREATED. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS DONE THIS. INTO WE SET OUT TO REALLY RIGHT. EXPECTATIONS IN THE RESPONSIBLE FOR DISTRICTS AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS BELIEVE THAT FACULTY DIVERSITY INTERNSHIPS WERE LEGAL THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE WHEN IN FACT THAT IS ENCOURAGED BY THAT YOU'LL FUNDS OF THE LEGISLATURE. BY THEY ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE- TARGETED OUT REACH ALSO SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT IS A BEST PRACTICE THAT IS ENCOURAGED BY THE EAGLE PLANTS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS A SYSTEM TRYING TO RECTIFY. PROVIDE INFORMATION PLANS ONLY DOES. FROM STATEWIDE OFFICE BUT THE WORK THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN TODAY IS WE'VE SEEN A PROGRESS RIGHT WHEN YOU THROW MONEY AT THE SITUATION AND WE WERE PROVIDED TWO POINT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE. START UP TAKE THERE WERE SEVENTY SEVEN SEVEN. MEETING EVIL PLANS WE JUMP NINETY SIX PER IN A SINGLE YEAR. DIVERSITY WORK WRITER DIVERSIFYING OUR FACULTY THAT IS SIMPLY CHECKING OFF BOXES ON AN EAGLE PLAN THAT IS SUBMIT IT. THE REAL WORK HAPPENS AT OUR COLLEGES AND- SO ON SLIDE THREE. THE REAL WORK THAT TOOK PLACE OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS. OUR WHEN WE BEGAN THIS JOURNEY WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO INTEGRATE THIS WORK INTO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS IS OUR STRATEGIC. IN OUR THAT ADDRESSES STUDENT COMPLETE INS FOR BERMAN EQUITY AT. CLEARLY SPECIFICALLY OUR BOARD HAS ASKED US TO INTEGRATE IT INTO LOCAL RULES AND AS A TASK FORCE WE DECIDED THAT THIS WORK THE WORK OF DIVERSIFYING OUR FACULTY. FALL WITHIN VISION FOR SUCCESS GOING FIVE TO REDUCE AND REYES EQUITY GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM. AND IT FALLS UNDER EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR COMMITMENTS. WE SAY IS ON STUDENTS AND GOALS THAT IS WITHIN THEIR RIGHT WHEN WE SAY DESIGN. IN MIND THE WORSE THE FINER FACULTY IS HOW WE GET THERE. YOU KNOW WITH EVERY CONVERSATION TASK FORCE ON FLIGHT NUMBER FOUR. EVERYTHING BEGINS WITH DATA. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS A RECOVERING RESEARCHER- DATA STEP ONE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S OUR NEED TO ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION AS A TASK FORCE WHAT WE DECIDED WAS THAT WE AGREE ON A FEW NOT ONLY DID SIT DOWN LOOKED AT. LEAST THE STORE HUMANS OF OUR. TO LEARN. IS BY TRAINING A WE HAD IN. A MINUTE THE DOW WITH OUR TASK FORCE TO LOOK ABOUT WE LOOKED AT CULTURAL COMPETENCY- AND THEN WE HAD A PANEL OF FACULTY OF COLOR. WHO WE HEARD FROM AND THEY TAUGHT US ABOUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO DO TENSION AND SO ARE AND HOW WE SUPPORT FORTY OF COLOR. AND HERE'S WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH IN TERMS OF THE DATA THAT RECOGNIZED BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO WE THAT CONCEPT TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER HAS A SYSTEM. THE FIRST. ARM ROMAN IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY UP AND THAT. IS ARE GETTING MORE DIVERSE. FLIGHT NUMBER FIVE WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION OF ALL SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT CAMPUS YOU STEP FOOT ON THAT ANY ANY COLLEGE CAMPUS. RENTS ARE THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP ON THAT CAN. AND LASTLY WE AGREED TO DIVERSIFICATION IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM. ON SLIDE NUMBER SIX YOU SEE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS ALREADY ALREADY PROVIDED FROM THE EARLIER PANEL THAT IN FACT WE SEE MANY DIFFERENCES INCLUDING THE FACT THAT OUR JOB COOL T. R. EVEN A STATE PERSON OUR- FACULTY. AND THEN SLIDE NUMBER SEVEN THIS WHERE WE. DATA DOESN'T CHANGE PEOPLE TO. IT TOOK US FOUR MONTHS TO GET TO THIS POINT BUT THIS IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR SYSTEM WE NEED MORE DATA BECAUSE MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT SAID THIS WILL BURKE IS ABOUT TRANSFORMING IT. TO SHOW QUILTERS. AS A SYSTEM WE NEED TO MOVE FOR PASSED I AIMS TO EMPOWER MEANT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT OUR SYSTEM. NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE POLICIES AND REGULATE MEANS THE PROCEDURES FORMAL ACTICIN EVEN THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT. TO DO OR NOT. IN ORDER TO THEN IMPACT BILL. USE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I'M NOT NEXT LET ME SEE THAT THESE ARE THE COURAGEOUS PEOPLE WHO JOB DOES FOR TEN MONTHS LEAVE THIS WORK FOR OUR SYSTEM. AND OUR TASK. BY THE COLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE DOCTOR JOHN STANCE GIVES. ON SLIDE NUMBER NINE ARE YOU A BRIEF HISTORY OF OUR JOURNEY YOU SEE ON HERE THAT WE BEGAN WITH SIX MONTHS OF ENGAGEMENT AND THIS CRITIC NEW HAD MEANT. THAT INTO AN AND THEN TRY THIS RIGHT WE TRIED A TASK FORCE WE TRY CREATING PLAN AND THE PLAN IS THE EASY PART WHAT IS WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT WE NEEDED TO. FIND PROBLEM ENTIRE THEM IN ORDER TO BE. BECAUSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORK. AND WE DID THAT FOR SIX MONTHS WE PRESENT AT STATEWIDE CONFERENCES. AND ON SITE NUMBER TEN THIS IS WHAT WE SHARED WITH THE SYSTEM. WE SHARED WITH THE SYSTEM ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH ON THIS CAMPUS MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER IN THE AIR- BUT HE WAS APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ON THAT DAY. AND WHAT WE COULD ALL AGREE. THAT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAW. IT IS MEANT TO HELP US BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE OF OUR DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION. THAT THIS WORK IS EVER FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AN EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THAT THIS WORK WILL HELP US CLOSE EQUITY APPS IF WE ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO THIS WORK. WE ARE FIRM THIS WORK ON SLIDE NUMBER ELEVEN- WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT. FACULTY DIVERSIFICATION AS IMMOBILIZER FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND AS A SYSTEM AGREED THAT WE NEED TO MOVE PAST COMPLIANCE RIGHT AND FOCUS REALLY ON THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE AT DISTRICTS DEPARTMENTS VISIONS. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. PETER DISTRICTS IN OUR COLLEGES TO PARTNER UP TO DO THE WORK. IT'S LIKE TWELVE YOU THAT WORK VISUALLY AND THE- CHANGE THAT WE ALL AGREED ON AS A SYSTEM AS A TASK FORCE. STATE IS REALLY THE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ONLY BRIEFLY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THIS IS THE WORK THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN. ON SLIDE FOURTEEN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY ON THESE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS ACTUALLY A SIXTEEN PAGE REPORT OF STRATEGIES TO CHANGE REGULATIONS PROCEDURES AND SENT SOME BEST PRACTICES. I THINK A KEY PART OF THE WORD IS YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT A ROOM OF. HIS IN RESOURCE ARE NEEDED BUT A LOT OF WORK IS ALSO WE CAN. ONE OF THE LEVERS TO DO THIS WORK AND HOW IT'S A COMPLIANCE LEVER BUT OUR TASK FORCE ALSO IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE ON ON THOSE SIXTEEN PAGES. THE FIRST IS A TIER ONE ACT HE WHICH- CAN BE DONE EXISTING. SO MEANING DONE. SO I PROVIDE YOU TO REALLY BRIEF EXAMPLES BUT THE ONE I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS SLIDE NUMBER SEVENTEEN. SO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS SEVEN COMMITMENTS AND ONE OF THOSE COMMITMENTS IS COMMITMENT NUMBER THREE. I EXPECTATIONS SUPPORT. WHAT ARE TASK DECIDED WAS THAT ONE OF THE STRATEGIES IN WHICH WE CAN PAYER HIGH EXPECTATIONS WITH HIGH SUPPORT IS TO ESTABLISH A PIPELINE PROGRAM TODAY THE FIRE FACULTY APPLICANT POOL THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH IN BOTH IN PRIVATE OF THE QUIRK LIGHTS HOW THAT WOULD. WORK HAS BEEN DONE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD. TO POST IT'S ONE OF THOSE EXIT. IN OUR SYSTEM WE IDENTIFY TIER ONE THESE AS A WAY TO MOBILIZE AND TO CREATE THAT FACULTY APPLICANT POOL AND DIVERSIFY THE APPLICANT POOL. ONE OF THEM EXCITED IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAVE AGREED TO PARTNER TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE GUIDANCE CLARITY. NEWMAN QUALIFICATIONS OF TACKLE T. AND I'M SURE THE MIX AND IT WILL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER. A LOT OF CONCEPTION OUR SYSTEM ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED VERSES WHAT IS PREFERRED IF YOU TITLE FIVE THERE WE TO MINIMUM POLICY IS FOR FACULTY. SO WE BELIEVE THAT BY A TV. ONE SEVENTY NUMBER ONE YOU SEE ON HERE THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO CHIP AWAY. TO CLARIFY THAT FOR SYSTEM. TV IS TO CREATE A STATEWIDE PILOT FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TO HELP ENCOURAGE YOUR STUDENTS TO COME BACK TO OUR COLLEGES AND TEACH IF THEY ARE IN FACT THE MOST DIVERSE. SEGMENT OF OUR COLLEGES WHY NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO LET THEM COME BACK IN TEACHER CAMPUSES AND WE HAVE SEEN HUGE MOVEMENT ARE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND GRADUATE GRAD FROM PROGRAM THAT ARE COMING BACK TO OUR STATE WITH MASTER DEGREES SO I THINK EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS. CAPTURE THOSE STUDENTS. COMING BACK. ABOUT TRANSFORMING THE STRUCTURE. PROCEEDS TO THEN IMPACT THE PRACTICES ARE THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY CAME UP THROUGH OUR MANY DISCUSSIONS ACROSS OUR STATE AND CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE TASK FORCE. THE CLEAR DEFINITION FOR DIVERT. WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE HAD A VERY GENERIC- LANGUAGE THAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN TITLE FIVE THE RIVER CITY MEANS A CONDITION OF BROAD INCLUSION. IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT OFFERS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PERSONS REQUIRES BOTH THE PRESENCE ON THE RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. OUR COLLEGES AND DISTRICT ASK FOR GUIDANCE AND SO RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO IS ACT WAS ACTUALLY THE ADOPTION OF A DIVERSITY ECCRINE INCLUSIONS MEANT SO WHAT ARE VALUES BELIEFS AS A SYSTEM. AND THEN HOW CAN WE USE THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED TO ANTI. SO THAT WOULD LET ME BE A SOMETHING THAT WOULD REPORT TO ALL OF YOU TO THAN HELP US WITH- HOW WE CHANGE THE XIN STATEMENT ON THE STUMP. AS WELL AS CHANGING THE EGO. CHANGING THE TEMPLATE AS WELL AS CHANGING THE MORE FOR MEASURES WHICH IS THE WAY THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE FUNDS ARE EAGLE PLANS ALL OF THOSE CHANGES NEED TO HAPPEN. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY HAVE A DEFINITION IN A STATEMENT WERE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ARE AT THE FOREFRONT- IN A- RISE OUT ON PAGE NINE ON SLIDE NINETEEN. I SHOW YOU THAT VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THAT STATEMENT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO START WITH THE STUDENT IN MY- THE FIRST SENTENCE IS WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT. OPPORTUNITY OF ALL STUDENTS RIGHT WE WERE VERY INTENSE NO AS A TASK FORCE TO BEGIN THEIR TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THIS WORK. IS IN SERVICE OF OUR STUDENTS. AND OUR LAST RECOMMEND AND I'M ALMOST TOWARDS THE END- IS IT WAS A RECOMMENDED ADOPTION OF A BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HISTORICALLY THE STATE HASN'T VESTED ONE TIME FUNDS FOR FULL TIME FACULTY HIRING TYPICALLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. THE TASK FORCE PROPOSED INDICATED FUNDING MODEL THAT X. INVESTMENT STOCK TO THE FIRST TWO RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEY ALSO REQUEST THE MOBILE FUND. ON SLIDE TWENTY ONE LOOK YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE REQUESTED FOR TO OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS- THAT WERE SUBMITTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU SEE A LOT OF THOSE NEEDS ARE REALLY AROUND THINGS UP THE FIRST PANELIST SHARED OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT KLAY ON DATE. TIME HIRING DOT. I'M IS THERE CONNECTED TO THIS WORK. YOUR PLAN FUNDING IN ORDER TO DO SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES SOME OF THESE IDEAS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE ALREADY INCENTIVIZE BY TITLE FIVE. THE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN THERE BUT ALSO IT'S BECAUSE WE KEEP THESE CONVERSATIONS I LOS RATE. A STATEWIDE FACULTY FELLOWSHIP YOU SEE THAT ON HERE A MODERNIZE HE SEES REGISTRY WEBSITE OUR WEBSITE IS EXTREMELY OLD AND WHAT WE KEEP HEARING ACROSS THE STATE IS. THAT NOT ONLY DO WE NEED A PLACE WHERE WE CAN UPLOAD ALL. OF THERE AND USE DATA TO ANALYZE. WHOSE ACTUALLY APPLYING TO THESE JOBS WHAT'S THE APPLICANT POOL THEY WOULD LIKE A SITE THAT'S ABLE TO AGGREGATE THAT DATA AND PROVIDE THAT ANALYSIS. AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE MODERNIZING OF THAT WEBSITE ONLINE TRAINING MODULES VERY IMPORTANT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ACROSS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WORK SITES IS THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO JUST TO CULTURAL COMPETENCY ARE ON. JUST AS FOR HIRING COMMITTEE THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN HAS TO THAT WORK AT THAT WORKS STATE AND SO THE NEW PRACTICES IN DOING THAT CAMPUS WIDE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME PRIVATE CALL IS. ANOTHER STATE I'M CON IS A CULTURAL COMPETENCY THE RECALL. A SINGLE FRESHMAN THAT IN AND I CAMPUS SO THE ONLINE TRAINING MODULES WOULD BE OUR OFFICE PROVIDING A MODEL A MODEL ON A JEWEL. OF CAMPUSES. CAN YOU. ONE OF OUR LAWYERS WHO'S WHO ONE OF THREE LAWYERS IN OUR SYSTEM OFFICE. I'LL END WITH THIS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ONGOING WORK AND ON SLIDE TWENTY TWO I SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE REALLY BIG GOALS AND TIMELINE PIECES THAT OUR OFFICE NEEDS TO MEET FOR A BOARD OF GOVERNORS. BUT THE FIRST TIME WE PRESENT AT THIS A PROBLEM. WE HAD FOLKS WHO WOULD LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN WE WOULD HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. I THINK YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS READY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED. YOU HAVE A BOARD OF GOVERNORS. NEEDED AND YOU HAVE A CHANCE IS OFFICE STAFF THAT'S DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT THIS WORK GETS DONE. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. MISS GARCIA. LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS OR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE HE IS VERY FOR THE DELAY I LIKE HERE FOR THE HEARING IN TWO THOUSAND. SIXTEEN SO PRETTY THE BABY BACK HERE TO HEAR THE OF. WHERE WE ARE. IN THE. I AND IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING. I'M HAPPY TO SEE WERE ÁP BUT I GUESS I WISH YOU WERE A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THE STUFF BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY TO PLAN TO COLLECT THE DATA SO. APPRECIATE HER BEING HERE AND HER INSIGHT THANK YOU TO THIS ISSUE AND I DID WANT TO THE FROM THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION OR TALKING ABOUT YOU SEEM PROGRAMS TO HELP US WITH THE PRESS THE BIAS AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DEFINITELY TOOLS BUT WE NEED TO BE AWARE. OF THE LIMITATIONS TO HANDLE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BEING BUILT OUT THAT BY THIRTY IN THEM A LOT OF NICE CORRECT ALL OF IT. ALONG THE WAY AND SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT WHILE THE LIMITATION DOESN'T CORRECT FOR THE IMPLICIT BIAS BECAUSE OF THE DISSENTERS. PEOPLE HAD A VISIT BY THAT THE BUILDING INTO A PROGRAM. DOCTOR DOLLARS I LOOK LIKE THE SLIDE THAT I THINK IT SAYS THAT THAT. PLANS DON'T CHANGE PEOPLE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO. COLLEGES THAT HAVE MADE EACH AND THEN YOU YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT IT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SOME PEOPLE USED TO LEAVE THE ROOM. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME COLLEGES HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS. IN DIVERSIFYING THEIR FACULTY. AND UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE THAT IS HAPPENING THERE ARE EXPERIENCING PUSH BACK IF THAT A GOOD USE THAT PHRASE. FROM FROM THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES OR FROM FACULTY THEMSELVES OF FROM EXISTING FACULTY HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. NO I THERE IS THERE IS A LOT OF I CAN TELL YOU IN IN DOING THIS WORK- YOU KNOW IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO FOCUS ON YES THE PRE HIRING THE HIRING BUT VERY IMPORTANT ON THE RETENTION PIECE. RIGHT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH- FUNDING THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A DIFFERENCE UNLESS WE BEGIN TO DO THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES AT OUR CAMPUSES- WHAT I FOUND WAS WANTED TO CREATE A PANEL. OF FIVE COLOR. STORIES WITH UPS THOUGHT WHAT WOULD TAKE TO RETAIN THEM AND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH. I FAILED I GETTING AN INITIAL PANEL TO COME AND SPEAK TO OUR TASK FORCE AND I HAD TO ASK FOR HELP. AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAD ASKED WAS AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE TIME WAS NOT TEN YEARS. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THEY SHARED THAT THEY WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH COMING UP IN SHARING THEIR STORIES IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO I ASKED FOR HELP AND EVENTUALLY THE PANEL THAT WE GOT WERE INCREDIBLE SENATE PRESIDENTS IN OUR STATE WHO HAD TENURE. AND WHO WERE WERE NOT A FREE COURAGEOUS TO SHARE THEIR STORIES WITH OUR TASK FORCE. I THINK THAT WILL BE VERY COMMON THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WORK SITES I THINK THOSE CAMPUSES THAT ARE DOING REALLY WELL. HAVE LEADERSHIP. AND I THINK YOU HEARD THAT VERY CLEARLY FROM THE FIRST PANEL SPECIFICALLY. FROM TWENTY WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS WORK GETS IMPLEMENTED. A PART OF OUR JOB AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS TO CREATE THOSE. POLICIES THOSE STRUCTURES RIGHT IN WHICH FOLKS HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT COMES DOWN TO LEADERSHIP AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THAT CLEARLY VERY LOUD. IN SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WERE COMING UP. TALK ABOUT A CULTURAL. SHIFT IN THE CULTURE. ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE WERE I BELIEVE OF THE POOL. I THINK IT IS A SHELVE STATED. COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY HAS SHOWN THE WE'VE CERTAINLY GRADUATING A DIVERSE. NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS AND WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS NOW- WITH MASTERS AND NOT IN MANY MANY AREAS- AND AMONG THOSE ARE OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR RIGHT WHO ARE COMING OUT WITH MASTER'S DEGREES. BUT THEN. VERY OFTEN I CONTINUE TO HEAR STORIES OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO WHO. WOULD GO BEYOND THE MASTERS AND LOOK FOR THAN SOMEONE WITH THE DOCTOR. WHICH TO ME MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. GIVEN THE STUDENTS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE TEACHING. FIFTY NINE PERCENT- STUDENTS OF COLOR. I'M NOT SURE THE NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME HOW MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW WE SAW WE'RE NOT COLLEGE READY IN ENGLISH AND MATH. I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I RESPECT ANY FACULTY WHO HAS A PHD A RESPECTED OF THE WORK THEY DID BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE A PHD TO TEACH AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND N. F. DEPARTMENTS. CONTINUE TO OF. PHD TO A AN APPLICANT WITH A MASTERS IN JUST IN DOING THAT THEY ARE SELECTING OUT PERHAPS. APPLICANTS WHO ARE RICH APPLICANTS OF COLOR WHO COULD BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TEACHING I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE PIPELINE I LIKE THE IDEA OF UNITY COLLEGES SAYING WE ARE GOING TO GET THE STUDENTS AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK THEM WE'RE GONNA TRACK THEM THROUGH. GRADUATE. I LIKE THAT CONCEPT BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THE POOL EXIST ALREADY. AND WE ARE CLOSE ENOUGH. TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY THERE ALREADY QUALIFIED AND WE DO IT. ABSENT SUBTLE AND NOT SO SUBTLE WAYS. SO. AND I DO HEAR THAT I HEAR THAT FROM APPLICANTS. I YOUR THAT QUITE A BIT. RESPOND I THINK THERE ARE TWO KEY AREAS AND DOCTOR JOHN STANCES CAN BE A LOT MORE ELOQUENT THAN I CAN TALK ABOUT- EQUIVALENCY PROCESS SEES- AND THE ROLE OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE IN THAT WORK- BUT THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE YOU GUYS WAS EASY ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED VERSUS PREFERRED. TITLE FIVE. I THINK THAT THE FIRST BILL. FIRST IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A PHD I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON TO TEACH OUR. WELL AND MY IS IT IT'S ONLY. NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR. AND COMMUNITY. CONNECT QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU TO MINIMUM YEAH SO THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS AN ACADEMIC REQUIREMENT WHICH IS TYPICALLY A MASTER'S DEGREE ON THE OTHER ONE IS A SENSITIVITY TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF OUR STUDENTS SO HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY THAT SECOND ONE THE MATHIS MCCARTY SO I WILL TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF DOESN'T SAY HAS ALSO IT DOESN'T SAY IN ORDER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CURRENT HAVE. TITLE FIVE DOES NOT SAY THAT YOU ONLY. QUESTION IT IS NOT A YES SIR. BERMAN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS I THINK ONE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORK AND WHAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS COMMITTED TO IS HOW DO WE BEGIN TO SHOW GOOD MODELS TO OUR COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS AND BEST PRACTICES HOW YOU DO THAT. AND WE WILL THE WAY THAT YOU DO THAT IS NOT JUST BY ASKING HE SERVED A DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION OR DO YOU HAVE A SENSITIVITY IT'S WHAT HAVE BEEN THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDENTS AND HOW HAVE YOU. CONTRIBUTED TO THOSE OUTCOMES. SO. ALI IS TALKING ABOUT WE I'VE DEFINITELY I'VE I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TEACHING AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND AT THE UNIVERSITY AND I'VE DEFINITELY SEEN IT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WHERE WE WILL GIVE SO WHAT THE PHD. JOB. WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM ONE THAT DOESN'T TRANSFER INTO DOING. I'VE SEEN IT WITH MASSIVE DOSES I WANT TO. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING IN AND WE NEED TO REMEDIATE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. AND AS A MATH. THE LOS MATT THAT FIND THAT MOST I AM THE MORE TRAINING AND EDUCATION WE HAVE THE LEAST REPAIR WE ARE TO DEAL WITH THE STUDENTS WHO CAN'T RELATE TO THEM. EASY FOR US. AND THE WAY WE HAVE TAUGHT IT HAS WORKED FOR US ALWAYS. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA GET NECESSARILY ANNA. MASTERS CLASS OR PHD CLASS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES A SOME MORE OFTEN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL CREDENTIAL LEVEL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS. AND THEN THEY- ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS MORE. ARM OUR STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. OUT THERE SO I THINK. NOT ONLY. OUR TALENTED BUT WE ALSO. IT'S ALL OVER THE BY THAT THAT WE SEEM TO THINK THAT THAT THE GREEN LEADS TO BE IN A GOOD. ON IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S USUALLY THE OPPOSITE. ABS MY LAST QUESTION. THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCES AND I REALIZE THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MY CORRECT DIFFERENT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I KNOW THE DATA. IS PRETTY I WOULD I WOULD SAY DISMAL. HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU KNOW THAT WE CHANGED ANYTHING SINCE THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED. IS READY FOR THE QUESTION I MADE A LIST. I THINK THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOU PROVIDED THAT FUNDING I THINK ONE AS YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT- YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THEIR SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE SO IT'S A PART OF THAT THAT- COME WHAT COMPELS PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION. I THINK THAT FIRST PIECES REALLY IN IN CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT THIS WHICH IS NOT YOU WAS SAID BY THE EARLIER AND ALL. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE IS OP HIGHLIGHTING. PARTNERSHIPS AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THIS WORK- OUR ACADEMIC SENATE PARTNER WITH OUR OFFICE TO DO THIS WORK AND THAT WILL BE CRITICAL AND US BEING ABLE TO SAID HE'D MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN NOT BE ON. SEVERAL DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS REQUIRE. FIVE CHANGES DIFFERENT REGULATION CHANGE. EXPO IN A SPACE LIKE THIS IN PICKING THROUGH HOW WE THEN MOBILIZE AN ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS BEEN A PART OF THE PROGRESS RIGHT I THINK. WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN EXISTING POLICIES INSTRUCTORS WHAT PRINT AND WHERE WE ARE EIGHT IS THAT WERE SEEN THAT THOSE STRUCTURES NO LONGER WORK AND THAT THEY WILL NOT GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

WITH THAT SAID I I'M GOING TO SHARE COOLEY- OUR STATS AND YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT REFLECTS THAT THE COMMUNITY OF APRIL COUNTY IS COMPRISED OF ALL EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. LET THE NUMBER COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS AT IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE ARE LIKE THE MOST. THAT THAT'S OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE INSTITUTION. 54% OF THE FACULTY ARE LATINOS AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT OF THE FACULTY SO THE THAT'S REPRESENTED THERE. THE MAJORITY ARE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES SO 67% OF THOSE THE FACULTY MEMBERS REPRESENT IN THAT THE STATISTIC ARE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. I'VE THE HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST. PERCENTAGE OF FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBERS AND 83% OF THE FIGHT PLEASE LET ME KNOW. AND FINALLY LET THE NO I DO WANT TO. PROBABLY SHARE THAT WE'VE WE'VE IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY- WE HIRED THE FIRST FEMALE CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICER IN THE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE. WHO HAPPENS TO BE LUCKY ENOUGH WE HIRED THE FIRST PERMANENT MINORITY FEMALE VP OF ACADEMICS SERVICES. IN THE THREE OF THE COLLEGE WHICH HAPPENS TO BE LET THE NOT AND I'M NOT STATING THAT THEY WERE HIRED. BECAUSE OF GENDER OR ETHNICITY. BUT THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT AS AN INSTITUTION WE'RE TRYING TO REPRESENT WHO WE SERVE. AND. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IT LEAVE THAT IS WHICH IS THE RESULT WE CRITICAL WAY IT'S REALLY TO REVIEW DISTRICT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND AT IBC WITH THE PERFECTLY REVISED OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE TO HOP. GREEN. APPLICANTS AND TO LEAD THE INTERVIEW PROCESS AND ULTIMATELY TO HIRE AND THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE SEVENTY ONE TWENTY I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH IN THAT PROCEDURE EVERY COMMITTEE IS LED BY A MANAGER OR IN THE MINISTRY. WE PREVIOUSLY- LOUD FOR THOSE COMMITTEES TO BE LED BY FACULTY MEMBERS OR- DEPARTMENT CHAIRS IN AND I AND VERY RESPECTFULLY I SAY THAT BUT IT'S TRUE- THERE ARE CERTAIN. DEPARTMENTS THAT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OBVIOUSLY WITH HIGHER ONLY PEOPLE THAT LOOK. LIKE THEM OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES RELATE TO. I ALSO DON'T SEE IT I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD THE CHART YES TO A AT THAT I'M LOOKING AT ON FACULTY COULD COULD YOU JUST GO OVER WITH ME. THE BECAUSE I I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND LIKE THE COLOR SCHEME YEAH SO ON FACULTY. FIFTY FOUR POINT TWO. PERCENT ARE A LOT ABOUT THE YEAH THIRTY SEVEN POINT 1% ARE WHITE. AND FOUR POINT SEVEN. PERCENT OTHER- WHICH INCLUDE AFRICAN AMERICAN MIDDLE EASTERN AND SOME THAT COULD SELVES AS OTHER. THANK YOU. IN IN THIS REVIEW PROCESS- I DO WANT TO CONVEY THAT AS THE SUPERINTENDENT PRESENT ONE OF MY MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES IS TO HIRE AND I HOLD AN INFORMAL INTERVIEW WITH EVERY EVERY FACULTY FINALISTS. AND OBVIOUSLY EVERY MINISTRY FINALLY AND WHY IS THAT CRITICAL BECAUSE THE FACULTY ESPECIALLY THE ONES IN THE CLASSROOM ARE THE ONES THAT WILL. DEAL WITH THE STUDENT MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY IF A STUDENT REMAINS ENGAGED IS STUDENT REMAINS RETAIN WITH WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO A GREATER PROBABILITY OF COMPLETION AND DURING THAT IN FOR MY INTERVIEW I INCLUDE THE STUDENTS. AND OUR CONVERSATION IT'S ALL BASED ON WHO MY STUDENTS ARE. WHY SHOULD I HIRE YOU WHAT WHICH YOU. CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS HOW WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND I UP TO NOW THE STUDENT NIGHT HOLD A DISCUSSION AFTER EVERY- IN FOR MY INTERVIEW WE HAVE AGREED ON WHO NEED TO BE HIRED AND REALLY WHO ELSE WILL KNOW MOM THEN THE STUDENT I ASK THE STUDENTS WHO DO YOU WHO WOULD YOU PREFER TO HAVE A FRIEND UP YOU TEACHING. AND NOT EVERY HIGHER. IS OF. OR THE DESIGN. BECAUSE MY PRIORITY IS TO HIRE SOMEONE THAT'S COMMITTED. TO SERVING MY STUDENTS AND THAT WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS. WHEN WE HIRE AND THIS HAS BEEN- IMPLEMENT AND THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HOPE THE NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION FOR ON ON ALL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING ARE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS. BUT I ALSO WHERE I FOCUS A LOT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND MY PHILOSOPHY AND MY EXPECTATIONS WHICH IS REALLY TO ENSURE STUDENTS AT THE CENTER OF WHAT WE DO. AT NIGHT THEN AN INVITATION TO EVERY NEW PERMANENT TO MEET WITH ME PERSONALLY WHERE WE- TALK ABOUT THEIR PRIORITIES BUT ALSO MY PRIORITIES. V. IT BROKEN MAKE COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD HAS ALSO PRIORITIZE. IN THEIR ANNUAL GOALS THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE THERE ARE HIRING POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE FAIR. EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE SO OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY IS IT. A PRIORITY FOR ME BUT IT'S ALSO A PRIORITY FOR THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO ENSURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD STIR. WHEN THE V. TOOLS THAT WE USE USE. AND IMPLEMENT IT RECENTLY WITH AN ONLINE APPLICATION TO WHICH MANY OTHER COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED NAY AUG OF OR SIMILAR TOOLS AND WITHIN THAT TO ITS ITS BECAME VERY EASY TO TRACK WHO'S APPLYING. OBVIOUSLY WE TRACK FOR APPLICANTS THAT ARE THERE ARE THERE IS NO CITIES WHERE THEY APPLYING FROM AND. WE ALSO OBVIOUSLY YOU TO LIFE THAT TO INFORM OUR AND OUR OUR PRACTICES ARE HIRING PRACTICES THAT'S WE MOVE FORWARD. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES AS I SEE THEM FROM MY STANDPOINT WITHIN FOR THE SYSTEM. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THERE ARE SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COLLEGES. AND WE ALL DIFFERENT PROCEDURES FOR RECRUITING AND SCREENING POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. FOR ME WHEN I THINK AS I STATED WHAT'S MOST CRITICAL OF THE POLICIES. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE POLICIES AS OUR SYSTEM- PARTICIPATES OR IN. INCLUDES PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE IN OUR DECISION MAKING NOT. IT IS THE ACADEMIC SENATE WHO SUPPORTS US WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT MODIFY POLICIES. AND NOT ONLY THEM OTHER PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES AND IT IS THOSE COMMITTEES THAT PICKED UP HOLD THE CHANGE IN POLICY. SO IT'S I'M THANKFUL THAT MARY IS AND THAT AND ALLEN ALLY AND ADVOCATE AND A SUPPORT OF OUR OF OUR STUDENTS AND REALLY SOMEONE THAT THE PORTS. WHAT WE NEEDED TO. WHICH IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF STUDENTS. I'M SOME ANOTHER TELLING THAT I SEE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE COULD CONTINUE HIRING AND STRIVE TO ENSURE WE MODIFY POLICIES PROCEDURES- THAT WE TRAIN OUR INTERVIEW COMMITTEE. BUT REALITY WHEN WE MAKE A HIGHER AT AT A COMMUTE COLLEGE I THINK ABOUT WE'RE HIRING FOR THE NEXT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS MOST LIKELY THESE EMPLOYEES SPECIAL. AT APRIL VALLEY COLLEGE WILL REMAIN HERE FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE HIRED WE PROVIDE. AND CONSCIOUS. WE PROVIDE. CITY COMPENSATED. CAN SEE TRAINING AND EQUITY MINUS A BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME. WE SERVE THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE. AND UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE READY FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE. THAT THE EMPLOYEES DON'T THINK THAT THE STUDENT NEEDS TO COME READY TO YOU WHERE THE INSTITUTION THAT NEEDS TO BE READY FOR WHO THEY ARE AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE ENHANCING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE. THAT. DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR STUDENTS AS BEST AS THEY CAN. AND FINALLY MY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. AS AS THE- I CAN ACHIEVE THIS THE LOAN- IT IS WITH THE SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT I WORK WITH AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT I BILL. THE TEAM AND SUPPORT THE TEAM THAT I RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL WITHIN THE EMPLOYEES AS TO WHO COULD AS PLANNED TO HIGHER ROLES- AND THAT ULTIMATELY I AM EMPOWER THEM. TO TRANSFORM THE INSTITUTION TO WHAT I ENVISION THE INSTITUTION WILL BECOME FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. IDENTIFYING FACULTY AND STAFF THAT'S COMMITTING TO ENHANCING. DIVERSE CITY AND THAT'S COMMITTED TO INCLUSION AND IT'S CRITICAL. BECAUSE THERE ARE LA IF THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE SPENDING MOST OF THE TIME ON CAMPUS- AND NOT THAT WE DON'T AS AS AS FEELS HOWEVER THERE THE WEDNESDAY INTERACTING WITH THE STUDENTS THE MOST. ADD TO PARTNER. WITH HUMAN RESOURCES IT IS THAT. OBVIOUSLY I CONVEYED WHAT THE PRIORITY AND THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO. HOPEFULLY ACHIEVE THE PRIORITIES AND THE LAST ONE. RETAINING ARE AMAZING EMPLOYEES. IT IT HAS BEEN CONVEYED THAT WE HAVE GREAT EMPLOYEES AT SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND WE'RE NOT ATTAINING THEM IN THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD FOR VARIOUS REASONS BUT- AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THE CAMP. COLD THE US. INVADING SINCERELY OUR APPRECIATION AND EMPOWERING THEM TO WHO E. INNOVATIVE. REMINDING THEM THAT THEY BE LONG THAT WILL RETAIN THEM SO WITH THAT I AND MY COMMENTS AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY. THANK YOU. SEVEN WOMEN NEED TO TURN IT ON I'M NOT NERVOUS. ACTUALLY MY NAME'S MERRY GRIN AND I AM THE ACADEMIC SENATE PRESIDENT ADAM FOR ABOUT A COLLEGE BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM B. E. OPS COUNSELOR AND HAVE BEEN ONE FOR TWENTY YEARS- SO. UPS IS ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL STUDENT EQUITY AND WHAT THE DANCE ASSESSMENT OR WHAT WE CALL ACHIEVEMENTS I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF ALL THESE- NEW PROGRAMS WE HAVE BUT WE WERE THE ORIGINAL ONES THAT SUCCESSFULLY FOR YEARS SO WHEN I WAS A- SPEAKER ON I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. SO STUDENT WHEN HE STARTED KINDERGARTEN IN MINNESOTA HE SPOKE WITH ME NOT SPANISH SWEDISH SOME. INTERESTING THOUGH I LIKE TO CONVEY THAT TO MY STUDENTS- HE DIDN'T GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL HE WENT INTO THE MILITARY WORLD WAR TWO MY MOM DID SOME COLLEGE BUT I ALWAYS HAD. THAT FOR MY PARENTS GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL I KNEW I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE- WHEN I STARTED I YOU SEE I WAS A SINGLE. THE WHAT. CHILD. PICTURE LOPEZ STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED IT GROW YOUR OWN AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS HE WAS GIVING PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE MY MASTER'S DEGREE BUT HE WOULD GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN A MASTER'S PROGRAM COMPLETED AND YOU WORK PART TIME TO GET TO THE- EXPERIENCE SHE NEEDED TO GO OUT AND BE A COUNSELOR. I'D SAY THAT 90% OF THE COUNSELORS IN HER EARLY ARE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT I WE SEE AT ONE POINT OR ARE YOU ARE ARE YOU SEE ALONE- WHEN I STARTED- BECAUSE THAT WAS IN THE EIGHTIES ON A- I DIDN'T GET TOO INVOLVED WITH HE'S ON CAMPUS I WAS LIKE THE REPORT THAT THE PREFERRED. TO JUST WENT TO THEIR DOG AND. TWO THOUSAND TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN SAID GET INVOLVED WITH SENATE SO I DID. I'VE BEEN ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN THE PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST FOUR. SO I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I WAS TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH WHEN DID SENATE REALLY GET INVOLVED WITH THE HIRING PRACTICES HR. THE DIRECTOR OF THE TIME CAME TO SENATE DISCUSSED- THE NEED FOR A SIM MAKE CHANGES AND WE WERE ALWAYS POSITIVE. WITH WITH- APPROACH AND I THINK. THAT WOULD JUST SOME QUICK STATS. WITH OUR OUR FACULTY IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAD. EIGHTY NINE FULL TIME FACULTY BY THE TIME A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ROLLED AROUND WE HAD HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OF FEMALE FACULTY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY NINE HOME OR 44% AND- BY THE TIME TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ROLLED AROUND WE HAD SEVENTY SIX. THE MALE POPULATION IN TWO THOUSAND OF FACULTY WAS FIFTY AND IT GREW TO SEVENTY FIVE SORT. OF A FEW MORE- AND THEN WE DO. HAVE MEANT OKAY BUT- I THINK THIS MOVIE CAN INCREASE AND I JUST PICKED THE HISPANIC. THE WHITE- FULL TIME FACULTY ON OUR CAMPUS LIKE MORE TO SAID. ON 92% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HISPANIC AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FACULTY THAT IS 42% HISPANIC. BUT THAT'S A GROWTH FROM 21% IN TWO THOUSAND SO WE'RE MAKING. WE'RE IN WE'RE IN. MAKING PROGRESS WE HAVE A FACULTY THAT IS. A MORE DIVERSE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST- WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE IN BLOCK OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY. AND ASIAN. OF FACULTY IN EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HIRED. USE IT WILL BE SO I THINK WHAT AND IN THE VALLEY SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY CAMPUS YOU KNOW WE'RE A HUNDRED AND- TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM ANY OF THE COLLEGES HOME IN SAN DIEGO THAT WERE DISTRICT PART OF. A WE HAVE A HUGE- TIME FACULTY THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE FULL TIME FROM WE HAVE ENCOURAGE THEM TO APPLY FOR THE JOBS WE'VE OFFERED THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AFTER. HAVING WORKED WITH US. I THINK. AXIS DOCUMENT BUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN WE ADOPTED OUR- YOU YO PLAN IT WAS APPROVED IT WAS VETTED THROUGH DIFFERENT- COMMITTEES BUT SAID IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE FOR IT WE DON'T DISCUSS TO QUITE A BIT IT WAS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND I THINK GO DO YOU GO HIRING PROCESS THAT WE APPROVED OF ALL OF THIS MAKE UP OF THE EIGHTIES SENATE- WHEN IT COMES TO DISTRIBUTORS HAS TO FACULTY MEMBERS ON THAT HIRING COMMITTEE WHEN IT COMES TO A FACULTY POSITION I GET TO CHOOSE FROM AND I DON'T TAKE THAT LONG- FACULTY I. PUT AN EMAIL OUT. ALL THEY WERE. HIRING COMMITTEE. WHAT IT IS AND I. GET TO CHOOSE. WHO EVER RESPONSE BUT WE ALSO HAVE. A FACULTY MEMBER FROM THAT AREA IT'S ENGLISH THERE'S THE ENGLISH FACULTY MEMBER. ON THAT COMMITTEE. THE THAT'S LOOKING AT PICKING IN THE ON A NEW FACULTY WORK MOST OF TIME THE TWO. OF FACULTY MEMBERS ARE FROM THE DIVISION. I HOW TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MATH HOME AND MATH FACULTY. OF WELL I'VE- SEEN THAT IN THE PAST WHERE THEY WANT TO HIRE. SOMEBODY WITH THE PHD. AND AT IBC IT'S- BUDGET. WHAT WE GET THE STATE CANNOT RELATE TO OUR STUDENT BODY- AND THAT'S A THAT'S A SHAME ONE MORE COMMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS A WHOLE TENURE PROCESS SO RIGHT ARE YOU HAVE BEEN VERY- TRIED TO BE VERY INCLUSIVE WITH OUR NEW FOUND. BOB IS A- FIRST YOUR FAT COMMITTEES. OR YOU GET THE MENU GET THE NEW FACULTY IN THERE YOU INTRODUCED INTO THE SCHOOL THEY HAVE LITTLE SOCIAL EVENTS IS SOMEBODY FOR THEM TO BOND WITH AND HOPEFULLY GET THAT FEELING THAT THEY BELONG ON THE CAMPUS. DARN EVERYONE OF THOSE SENIOR MOMENTS. OF THE WORLD WAS GOING WITH THIS WE HAVE. WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL OF TRAINING FOR OUR FACULTY WE DEVELOPED AND STARTED A TLC TEACHING LEARNING CENTER WHICH HAS BEEN VERY- OF PRODUCTIVE IN IN GOING OUT AND OFFERING WORKSHOPS SO THAT OUR FACULTY ARE WHERE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TEACH IN OUR CULTURE YOUR CULTURALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. ACTUALLY THERE REALLY. PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC BUT THE I'VE LIVED IN THE ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO EMBRACE THE CULTURE AND UNDERSTAND THE STUDENTS WERE COMING FROM. THEIR INTERACTION WITH- A LEADERSHIP IN PEOPLE OR THAT THEY LOOK AT IS LIKE PROFESSORS ARE. ALMOST KIND OF PERFECT LIKE I DON'T CHALLENGE A PROFESSOR THAT TIME THAT ATTITUDE OR TRY TO GET THEM TO CHANGE- BUT BECAUSE I AM I AM ACCOUNTS ARE GOING TO TAUGHT. FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND A PSYCHOLOGY. SO WHY. WE. TRYING TO EMPOWER FOR OUR OUR FACULTY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS HE SAID THEY ALL WORK WITH AND- AND WORK WITH STUDENTS SERVICES I AM STUDENT SERVICES SIDE OF THE HOUSE FIRST AND FOREMOST- I'M I'M ONLY THE SECOND STUDENT SERVICES SENATE. PERSON. AND THE SECOND WOMAN SO HE'S GIVING. IS AS SHE SAID SHE TOLD ME WHEN YOU START TALKING VERY IT'S GOING TO GO LIKE THAT SO YES THEY DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME I'LL BE HAPPY TO. MEET YOU BACK THERE AND- I NEED TO GO M. AND WITH THAT. BINDER THAT WE ONLY HAVE ROOM ONE O'CLOCK. WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER PANEL STILL TO GO. SO PLEASE THANK YOU FOR CONSCIOUS OF THE TIME. THE SUIT DID ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE THANK YOU FOR IMMEDIATE TO INDIA OR US RATHER TO SPEAK ABOUT CENTERS A. COMMITTEE COLLEGE SENATE COMMITTEE COLLEGES PART DISTRICTS SO WE ARE CENTERS A. CITY COLLEGE AND EVERGREEN- COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP. BECAUSE IN LAST. OCTOBER IN AUGUST TWENTY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE A CRITICAL PART OF YOUR EDUCATION- DIVERSITY IN INDEX OF MENTIONED THAT EVERGREEN WAS NUMBER TWO AT SAN JOSE CITY WAS NUMBER SEVEN. OF ALL OF THE TWO YEAR PUBLIC EDUCATION. SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY SO BOTH PART OF BOTH COLLEGES. HAVE DONE A BILL WOULD DRESSED. SENATE IS A COLLEGE WE WENT. IN OUR BASE YEAR OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE FROM. 47% OF AND REPRESENTED FACULTY MEMBERS TO IN TWENTY. EIGHT EIGHTEEN NOT UNDER REPRESENTED THAT'S A HUGE GAME AND- WE'VE BEEN HAS A HISPANIC SERVER SHOULD YOU SHOULD SYSTEM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE'RE ALMOST DID YOU. AND WE'RE ONE OF THE HEART THE LONGEST SERVING COMMITTEE CALL JUST SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WE HAVE A VERY HIGH TRANSFER RATE FOR. STUDENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WE REPORTED ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES. NOW WHAT I LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THAT IS THAT EVEN THE WORST SMALL COLLEGE THAT HAS MAYBE NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS. ARE GRADUATION AT IS ATTENDED BY FORTY THOUSAND GAS BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEGREES IS WHICH OF COURSE MEANS SO MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN PART OF THE HAS BEEN IN THE. THE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE BOARD SO THE BOARD HAS COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY AND AS YOU SEE ON THE FIRST PAGE THERE IS. THERE'S A BOARD POLICIES SEVEN ONE ZERO ZERO AND THEN MR POLICY SEVEN ONE ZERO ZERO AND IT'S COMMITS US TO DIVERSITY RECOGNIZES DIVERSITY AND HIRING DEVELOPMENT THE PROCEDURES AND THEN- THAT LOOKS OF THE STUDENT BODY AND ARE PROP. SHOULD AS- AT OUR PLACE AS VERY IMPORTANT SO ON THE SECOND PAGE WE HAVE THE FACULTY THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE. COSTS ARE PROFESSIONALS AND THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE- USED AS A BAIT BENCHMARK WITH PART OF OUR. EOC REPORT IT WAS TO THAT FIVE. THE COURT WILL WIN 200-052-2000 EIGHTEEN IN TERMS OF. FACULTY DIVERSITY WE WENT FROM 40% UNDER REPRESENTED TO SIXTY SEVEN. WITH EYES GROWTH BEING HISPANIC A FACULTY MEMBERS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A VERY DIVERSE CAMPUS WITH ABOUT 80% OF OUR STUDENTS BEING UNDER REPRESENTED FOR EIGHTY FIVE- BUT YET OUR FACULTY IN OUR HISTORY HIRES DIDN'T REFLECT THAT. SO IN. TWO THOUSAND FIVE BAR ADMINISTRATION WAS- 48% UNDER REPRESENTED AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND 1883% OR PERCENT. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF STE OF GAINES AND PART OF OUR GAINES REALLY BECAUSE- PARTICULARLY WITH OUR FACULTY WE REALLY LOOK AT THE TV DEMONSTRATION. THE ABILITY OF OUR FACULTY TO WORK WITH OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE OTHER UNDERPREPARED OR FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS IN THE READ STYLES. AND THEN- ALSO WE HAVE OUR ACADEMIC SAID IT IS SENATE A PRESIDENT THAT IS. AT. ALL OF OUR HIRING. OF FOR BOTH ADMINISTRATORS AND FOR FACULTY. AND THEN ALSO- THAT IS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR JOB DESCRIPTIONS- WE ALSO HAVE A REALLY GREAT SUPPORT NETWORK SO WE HAVE TO ASSOCIATIONS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF. LATE WHICH IS THE LEAD LATINO EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND THE A. P. I. A WHICH IS ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS ASSOCIATION STORE TO LARGER STUDENT GROUPS ARE LUCKY. AND EIGHT. SO THOSE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR WHAT. TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. MORNING MORNING I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW ON IS THE YOU WILL BE. I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR WHAT IS IT THAT HAVE DONE. OUR INSTITUTION HOW IS IT THAT WE HAVE BREAK INTO THIS WELL THE BARRIERS AND REMOVING ALL THE WALLS SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO LIKE THEIR FROM THE- EARTH. BY MICHAEL D. I AM. MERRILY BUT WE HAVE ALSO AND IT AT IN WITHIN THEIR THIS AND THE ONE THING I REALLY WANTED YOU WITH IS THAT. YOU HAVE TO RECRUIT LEADERS THERE ARE UNAPOLOGETIC BECAUSE I THINK- THE PREVIOUS PRESENTERS- PRESIDENT NEW AND- DOCTOR GONZALEZ IN MICHELLE. THEY HAVE BASICALLY PRESENTED TO YOU THE CASE THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU THE DATE THAT THEY HAD GIVEN THE THINGS I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY TO GO INTO THAT AREA AREA WHICH I AM ALSO A DATA DRIVEN CRAZY INDIVIDUAL. I'M IN NO HAVING ABOUT ME NUMBER THEN YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA- METAL. I'VE IF ANYTHING WOULD MAKE MORE MISTAKES. HOWEVER AS AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT MYSELF. AS A FORMER LET THESE IN NETWORK AND ALSO- SB FIVE FORTY- DREAMER. ON THERE ASSEMBLYMEMBER VIABLE WHEN I DID MY FIRST HEARING AS A STUDENT AND AS AN UNDERGRAD THAT I NEEDED TO DISCLOSE THAT REALLY TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS. HE NEVER STOPS ME FROM ROOM. CONNECTING IN CORRELATING TO THE FEAR OUR FACULTY OF COLOR HAVE WHEN THEY ARE HIGHER. IS THIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PART TIMERS WHY IS IT THAT ARE PART TIME A POLICE NOT BIG ENOUGH WELL IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THE MAJORITY OF US THAT ARE GRADUATING OUR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WE WANT TO GET IT IN OKAY FOR A FAMILY FOR WHOM WE- ARE LOANS. TAKE OUR KIDS. SO WHEN WE HAVE. MASTER'S DEGREE A WE HAVE A DOCTOR DEGREE I'M GOING TO BE TRAVELING FROM ONE COLLEGE TO ANOTHER- WE'RE GONNA GET HIGHER MAYBE I WANT COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WE HAVE TO DRIVE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THE WAY TO GO WORK AT ANOTHER COLLEGE SO THEY PART TIME TO REALLY BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE IN THE PAIN. ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GOING. THERE GOES ONE ANSWER WIRE POOL IS SO SMALL THAT. THE MEANS THAT. IS AN EXCUSE TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS OF COLOR SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS A GOOD PAYING POSITION IT IS VERY REWARDING BECAUSE IT DIDN'T AND IS A POSITION THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE. FROM MODELS TO OUR STUDENTS. SEC WHEN I REFER TO AN APOLOGETIC. WILLING TO CONFRONT THE MICRO AGGRESSIONS THAT IS WILLING TO GO UP FRONT THE CULTURE THAT IS WILLING TO QUESTION THE PRACTICES POLICIES PROCEDURES AND IS WILLING TO GO FARTHER AND ABOUT. WHAT'S HAPPENING AT YOUR INSTITUTION AND IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THOSE THINGS BUT YOU'RE THE LEADER TO BE APPLES LOCAL AREAS DOCTOR GONZALEZ MADE A VERY CLEAR THE CHANGES THAT YOU WANT TO SEE IN THIS SYSTEM ARE HAPPENED LOCALLY AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN HAPPEN LOCAL. IS BECAUSE I DID THEM. AS YOU LOOK AT THE DATE. THE MIX PRESIDENT. BACK IN PRESIDENT YES THE YOUNGEST ONE IN THE GROUP A FACULTY MEMBER APPROACHING HIS AS WHEN YOU BECOME FACULTY MET- ACADEMICS IN A PRESIDENT NOT RETIRING AS IT WERE ON. I DID HE RETIRE. THOSE ARE GREAT DOT THAT WERE HAVING AS FACULTY OF COLOR. AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MANY DARK SKIN. AND SCARS AND EVERYTHING WE KERRY IN THE INSTITUTION BECAUSE HERE COMES FAVIO HOPE HE'S HE'S VERY LOUD BY THE WAY HE JUST COME HERE PURCHASE FOR ASKING AND REQUESTING THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE. DIFFERENT THINGS WHY YOU'RE STILL DEMANDING. BECAUSE IT'S COME DOWN TO HOW YOU DEVELOP A COLD. LUCY MISTING WELCOMING FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. THE REWARDS THAT WE ARE SEEN TO DATE IS THAT OUR LOCAL FEATURES ARE BECOMING MORE AWARE MORE AWARE OF OUR PHD. IN CHEMISTRY MATH PHYSICS OUT WE HAVE TO RECENTLY LET THE MASS WHO THE TENURE TRACK FOR MATHEMATICS I'M I CAN HONESTLY TELL PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED TO HAVE THE STATE YOUR POSITION IF YOU. BECAUSE OF THE POSITION ACT A BIT MINISTRATION. HEY WE'RE. STRUCTURE WE'RE GOING TO HIRE TO AGAIN AN APOLOGETIC APPROACHES SO MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE HIRING QUALITY INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE EVEN LATINOS IN OURSELVES WE HAVE THE OPTIMISM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE MINORITIES AND WE'RE ACTUALLY OUR DOCTOR DEGREE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WHILE I AM NOT TO HAVE A COMMUNITY RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE ALSO DEAL WITH. IF. I'M IS MY FATHER TO CALL LATER OR THE PUSH BACK AS YOU WERE REFERRING TO EARLIER. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE STRUCTURES AS MY COLLEAGUE JOHN STAND AS WELL COME AND EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. FOR US TO WORK LOCALLY WITH OUR LEADERSHIP SAID. ACTUALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATION PROCESS WE HAVE THE HIRING PROCEDURES THE TEMPLATE FOR. ALL INVOLVED THERE. TO THE DNA OF THE INSTITUTION. SO WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ACADEMIC SENATE. THIS IS BASICALLY A CONNECTION THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE THE COURAGEOUS DIALOGUE YOU START THINKING THE PROCEDURE. YOU CAN SEE THIS CHANGES HAPPEN. SO THE ALLIES TO THAT BIG DIVERSE SYFY. AND QUIRK IN MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR. IS HAPPENING YOU MUST. HAPPEN LOCALLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE PROP. THE CHANGE. WHICH IS ONE OF THE FEW. WITH THE IDEA. OF HAVING BESIDES THE COURAGEOUS CONVERSATIONS IS THE LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE BRING IN THIS TO THE FOREFRONT OF MATCHES THE ACADEMIC SENATE THIS IS A VILLAGE OUR LABOR UNION I'M ACTUALLY THAT ICE PRESIDENT OF MY LOCAL IN OUR LABOR UNIONS NEED TO TAKE SOME LEADERSHIP ON THIS. IBM. CHOOSE A INDIVIDUAL WHO SO WAS QUESTIONING THE ACADEMIC SENATE LOOKS SO WHITE. STATEWIDE COME ON LET'S RECRUIT SOME PEOPLE THEY LOVE PEOPLE OF COLOR WE ACTUALLY DOCTOR CENTERS ACTUALLY HELP US OF THE BARREL DEVELOPING THAT DIVERSITY COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE ON RECRUITING MORE LATINO FACULTY SO THAT THEY CAN SERVE ON LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AT THE STATE. EXAM THE SAME THING WITH THE UNIONS OKAY YEAH BECAUSE HE BECAUSE HE. QUESTION IN THEM AS WELL. THEY HAVE TO START HAVING THIS COURAGEOUS DOG DIALOGUES INTERNAL REVIEW ON WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING THIS IS A SYSTEM WIDE SYSTEMATIC. PROCESS THAT WE'RE LOCATING STAR ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE- AND WE'RE GONNA BE HERE SIXTY YEARS LATER. ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS WHY HAVE A WE GET OUR TO DIVERSE IDEAS SO RECRUITMENT MARKETING MAKING SURE THAT THE- WEBER REALLY. THIS POSITIONS OUT THERE AND REALLY CHANGING THE PROCEDURES IS CRITICAL ON MAKING THE CHANGES LOCALLY THANK YOU FIVE YOU- SAN JOSE STATE COLLEGE WHEN LOOKING AT YOUR CHART. FROM 14% IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LATINO 229% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS BUT IT ALMOST DOUBLED IN IN IN NUMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY POSITIONS HOW MANY FACULTY POSITIONS THAT REPRESENTED YOU DOUBLES I KIND OF THE NUMBERS BECAUSE WHEN I ARRIVE AT SOME OF THE COLLEGE THERE WAS ONLY THREE BY LAW IN THESE AS I LIKE TO RECORDING. ONLY THREE THREE. YES TENURE AND NOW WE'RE ABOUT THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR. OKAY SO FROM THREE TO THIRTEEN CARRILLO AND HAPPEN IS THAT. WHEN YOU GO ACROSS THE STATE THE MOST AND BY THE WAY I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE UPS. AND THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE COME ACROSS AS THEY WERE STUDENT SERVICE BUT THE MOST DIVERSE FACULTY COME FROM STUDENT SERVICES AND THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU'LL BE AN ENTIRE THAT FIRST FACULTY BECAUSE WE HAVE A WITHIN THEIR- QUALIFICATIONS BY THE WAY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT. THE NUMBER YOU GOTTA KEEP TRACK OF THOSE NUMBERS AND LOOK AT THAT IS. THAT YOURS. PLEASE SELECTING A POPULATION IS THAT YOU'RE PURPOSELY LOOKING OUT WHAT YOUR POSITION OF FACULTY YES AND HOW CAN YOU DIVERSE UP BY THAT. SAM WAS THAT I THINK IS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AHEAD WE'RE DEALING WITH MORE CHALLENGING ISSUES. WHICH HE HAS TO DO NOW THAT WORK. BY WE HAVE SOME VERY DIVERSE DIALOGUES ABOUT THE CULTURE- WHAT WE'RE HAVING THERE IS ABOUT 65% OF. THE IS FEMALE- I SAN JOSE CITY COLLEGE SO THAT HAS CHANGED ARE. ARE CASTING FROM PLEASE. BEING YOU. ARE COMING FORWARD. REMARKS. WHO MADE TO GIVE. PROGRESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL CONTINUE. GOOD AFTERNOON NOW SO GOOD AFTER YOU- MY NAME IS CAROL ACOSTA FARRAR AND ON ICE PRESS THE BACK THEN THE FEAR RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE- AND AGAIN AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS DONE ON BEHALF OF WELL I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU BUT ALSO ON BEHALF OF AND GREGORY AKERS AND- I WOULD. JUST TO PROVIDE SOME HONEST. ASIAN OF OUR FACULTY AND THEN REVIEW SOME OF SERVICES AND SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES. SO LET ME BEGIN WITH OF THE- PM. WITH REGARD TO BE A MALE FEMALE THE VACATION AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE 52% OF OUR FACULTY ARE FEMALE SO REAL QUICK 48% AND THAT'S THERE IS- THAT'S OF WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT- WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE SUBCATEGORIES THE COLLEGE SO FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT OUR NURSING FACULTY- AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. THE MAJORITY OF THAT SIR. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL AND SO. WHAT THE WHAT EFFORTS CAN WE MAKE TO- RECRUIT OF MALES IN MALE FACULTY IN OF PRIMARILY- HISTORICALLY FEMALE AREAS AND THE SAME. AND VICE VERSA- WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOWER A LIBERAL ARTS FACULTY THEY'RE FAIRLY WELL- EQUALLY- FIRST- OF VERSES ARE STEM FACULTY WHO ARE SLIGHTLY MORE MALE DOMINATED BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY. WELL THAT'S ALL OUR GENDER. STATISTICS WITH REGARD TO THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOR. OF FOR OUR ETHNIC OF THE ETHNICITY OF OUR FACULTY- WITH REGARD TO AFRICAN AMERICANS THE- IN OUR IN THE RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE SERVICE AREA SO THE SERVICE AREA MOST NEAR OUR COLLEGE OF COURT WE ARE- ARE A MULTI COLLEGE DISTRICT AND OF THE QUITE. BUT DISTRICT WE HAVE THREE COLLEGE. IF YOU HAVE DE ARE THE PRODUCTS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE IN OUR CITY AND OUR NEAREST CENSUS DESIGNATED PLACES. UP THERE ARE STUDENT POPULATION IS SEVEN POINT 4% AND OUR FACULTY ARE SIX POINT 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN. SIMILAR TO THE DATA THAT WAS BOUGHT FOR BY THE CAMPAIGN FOR CALL- COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY- THE NUMBERS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF WHEN THE DATA WAS PULLED. AMERICANS COMMUNITY IS FIFTY HI I'M SORRY FIVE POINT SEVEN. PERCENT THE OUR STUDENTS ARE FOUR POINT 7% AND OUR FACULTY ARE SIX POINT 7% SO IN THOSE TWO AREAS- WE HAVE DONE. SOME GOOD WORK. WITH REGARD TO- THE LATIN ACTS AND A WHITE POPULATIONS OF MORE OF OUR FACULTY AND STUDENTS. ARE THAT'S WHERE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE LARGEST GAP. IN AMONG OUR OF A MONARCH REGION IN OUR SERVICE AREA IS PRETTY 1% WHITE OUR STUDENTS ARE 20% WHITE. OUR FACULTY ARE 68% WHITE. WITH REGARD TO THIS BALLOT A LOT NEXT POPULATIONS 55% AMONG OUR WITH OUR SERVICE AREA 55% AMONG OUR SERVICE AREA 63% OF OUR STUDENTS. OUR OUR HISPANIC OR LATIN NEXT AND ONLY 20% OF OUR FACULTY. SO YOU CAN SEE IT'S IN THOSE TWO AREAS WHERE WE HAVE. ALLEN. SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT. GEN RECENTLY OR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THEN WE'VE SENT- SEVERAL TEAMS TO USC'S CENTER FOR URBAN EDUCATION AND PARTICIPATED IN THE QUEUE TRAINING THERE I AM AS A RESULT OF THAT WE'VE WE'VE SENT NOT ONLY FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS BUT ALSO. ON THE- SOURCES STAFF THAT WORKS UP PRIME WITH OUR COLLEGE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT- WE HAVE BEGUN ADDING EQUITY MINDED LANGUAGE ALL OF OUR FACULTY RECRUITMENT IN ADDITION. IT IT HAS ALSO RESULTED IN SOME- EXCELLENT TRAINING FOR FACULTY IN GENERAL WITH REGARD TO CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND IMPLICIT BIAS- BUT THOSE ARE MORE ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE- THE CLASSROOM WHICH IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT BUT- NOT THE NOT THE MAIN SUBJECT HERE WHICH IS HOW HOW ARE WE- HELPING TO. THE FIRE APPLE TEAM. I'M THE EQUITY MY LANGUAGE I WANT TO. TALK ABOUT THAT JUST FOR A SECOND ME JUST PULL IT UP HERE. SO RIVERSIDE. IS ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES THAT. ON OCCASION HAS INCLUDED LANGUAGES IN OUR JOB JOB ADVERTISEMENTS- THAT SAYS MASTER'S DEGREE REQUIRED AND PHD PREFERRED IN SOME CASES. THAT LANGUAGE WASN'T NEXT LANGUAGE WELL IT IS ALWAYS QUESTIONED IN REVIEW. IN OUR MOST RECENT RECRUITMENTS LAST YEAR EVERY JOB POSTING THAT WENT OUT INCLUDED THE IDEAL CANDIDATE WILL BE EQUITY MINDED WILL SHARE OF THE COLLEGES IN THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT TO EDUCATING ITS WORK LATE ETHNIC AND SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION.

THE JOB DESCRIPTIONS ALL ONE TWO REFERENCE OUR PERCENTAGE- THERE ARE AMONG OUR STUDENT POPULATION OF THOSE UP OF THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS AND ON THE STE. SHE HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION REFLECT THE GREAT. RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT THAT THE COLLEGE HAS TO BE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. THE RECRUITMENTS THAT IT RESULTED FROM WHEN THAT LANGUAGE WAS INCLUDED IN OUR JOB POSTINGS FOR FACULTY. OF THE OF THE- FACULTY THAT WERE HIRED THAT YEAR WE HAVE HEARD SIXTEEN FACULTY 69% OF THE HIRES WERE FEMALE AND 62% OF THE HIRES WERE. PEOPLE OF COLOR. PERSONS OF COLOR SO. WE'RE DOING A LITTLE DIGGING INTO THAT HE GAVE UP ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR RECRUITMENT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN REVIEWED TO- THAT SO THAT THE- THE COMPOSITION OF THE HIRING COMMITTEE AND SCREENING COMMITTEES- ARE DIVERSE THAT THE POOL OF APPLICANTS IS DIVERSE AND IF WE DON'T GET A DIVERSE POOL GO BACK BE AT HIGHS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND ALL THAT SO THOSE THINGS DID NOT CHANGE WHAT THE CHANGE WAS THE STATE. THIS EQUITY MINDED STATEMENT AND SO WHAT WE'RE. DID THAT STATEMENT ENCOURAGE BECAUSE THE POOL WAS THE SAME WE STILL HAVE A DIVERSE POOL. WE WERE DID WE IN BY THAT STATEMENT. PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO KNEW THAT THIS INSTITUTION RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE WAS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY SERIOUS ABOUT THE EQUITY MINDED AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE PEDAGOGIES THAT WE EXPECT ALL OF OUR FACULTY TO HAVE. SO. A BIT OF A WAYS TO GO WITH- WITH OUR DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR FACULTY WE ARE VERY POSITIVE AND WE'RE VERY HEARTENED BY OUR MOST RECENT EXPERIENCES- IN INCLUDING- THAT EQUITY DID LANGUAGE TO ALL OF OUR FACULTY RECRUITMENT THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT ALSO MEET WITH EVERY FACULTY HIRING SCREEN COMMITTEE TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE. EQUITY MINDED. AND TEACHING WE EXPECT TO HAVE HAPPEN AT THIS COLLEGE- IN TERMS OF- OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES- PROVIDING SUFFICIENT AND ENOUGH- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR FOR OUR EXISTING FACULTY- HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE AS I'VE SAID WE'VE SENT- MALL TO OUR TO BE FOR THE URBAN EDUCATION AND WE'RE NOW- WORKING ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- FOR THE EQUITY INSTITUTE FROM SCOTT. COLLEGE LOS HOTEL UP TO ESTABLISH A AN EQUITY INSTEAD. AB RIVERS CITY COLLEGE SO THAT WE CAN- CONTINUE THAT COULD WORK AND INSTITUTIONALIZE THOSE- THOSE ATTITUDES AND CHANGE THAT CULTURE- DATA TO HELP ON THIS JOURNEY. WITH REGARD TO ON BOARDING OUR FACULTY IN MAINTAINING THE FACULTY OF WE'VE ESTABLISHED A FIRST YEAR COHORT EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL OF OUR INCOMING FACULTY. THE COLLEGE IS ALSO CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW BEST TO INTEGRATE- COLOR WHITE EQUITY EXPECTATIONS INTO OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND ALL ALL OF WHAT WE DO. IN ADDITION ON THE COLLEGE ESTABLISHED A NEW A NEW COMMUNITY OF. FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND- AND- UP STAFF- STAFF EDUCATORS CALLED A LOS THE ASSOCIATION OF LATIN X. ADVOCATING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS TO BUILD COMMUNITY AMONG OUR- OUR LATIN X. STAFF AN ADMINISTRATOR AND FACULTY MEMBERS- SO ARE CHALLENGES THEN AGAIN UP ARE MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND PARTING OF OUR FACULTY IS. IS. SIX FOUR AND TO ONE AND THEN. WITH ALL THIS WORK OBVIOUSLY- FUNDING IS A KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S SARAH IT'S. DIFFICULT IN A B. B. THE- HIRED THE LOWEST FUNDED. ENTITY AMONG ALL THE EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURES I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL OF HER THE JUSTICES PARITY BETWEEN THE FUNDING PER STUDENT FOR UC VERSUS CAL STATE K. TWELVE AND THEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AT THE BOTTOM. SO SOMEBODY HAS TO BE ON THE BOTTOM BUT WE'RE PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE BOTTOM AND SO ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO A CITY THAT I THINK ONLY HELP THE CAUSE. OF. EVEN SEND OUR AND OUR FACULTY. THANK YOU MR GARCIA ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NOT NECESSARY. YOU KNOW IT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. ME THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH AND WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT IT IS UP TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I SALUTE EFFORT OF SAN JOSE CITY IMPERIAL COLLEGE ARE RCC MY COLLEGE HERE'S WHAT I HEARD. THAT WE HAVE 60% LATINO STUDENTS 20% LATINO FACULTY. SO IN MY DISTRICT AT THIS COLLEGE. I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF WORK STILL TO BE DONE THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT AND WILL GO ON TO OUR LAST PANEL. SO FOR OUR LAST PANEL. LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT AND REPRESENTED FACULTY BALANCE HOW THEY BALANCE THEIR CLASSROOM ROADS AND IN MANY CASES THEIR DEFAULT ROLES OF THE IN MANOR MENTORS TO UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS BEING A FORMER TEACHER AND A COLLEGE TEACHER I CAN'T BELIEVE OUT STUDENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE STUDENT FROM MARINO VALLEY. THAT WE HAD INVITED. IS SICK TODAY SO WITH THAT I WILL WELCOME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FROM RCC JOHN STAND KISS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENT SENATE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. A MEAN AND HELP ME WITH YOUR LAST NAME. THANK YOU WELCOME. WELCOME BOTH. ALL RIGHT. SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO INVITE THE STUDENTS OFTENTIMES YOU CAN FEEL LIKE WE'RE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE BUT TAKING THE TIME TO DISCUSS THIS TYPE OF THING WITH US AND SEE OUR PERSPECTIVES REALLY DOES NOT. QUITE A BIT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ALREADY ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESENTERS I THINK I'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS THIS SYSTEM- IS STRUGGLING TO MEET. ITS DIVERSITY IDEALS. AND I THINK THEY ALREADY DID THE JOB OF TALKING ABOUT THE DATA THAT GOES AROUND AND KIND OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE SO I. WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS ME AS A STUDENT. SO ALREADY IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE LEADERSHIP. THE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS OF VARIOUS CALL SYSTEMS. DON'T NOT. HAVE AS MUCH WORSE. WE'D LIKE. BUT THE WAY THAT THIS ACCESS STUDENTS IS IT SOME AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO TRUST. SINCE. IT'S CRUCIAL SELECT SOME CAMP IT'S OR EVEN MENTION ON THE HOUSE SOMETIMES THIS CAN LEAD TO A FEELING OF ISOLATION WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY MINORITY IN THE SITUATION AS A STUDENT THAT'S ALSO FILLED WITH AMPLIFIED ALREADY IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT CAN FEEL ISOLATED IF YOU GO TO A HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE FORCED TO INTERACT WITH INSPIRED. CLASSES IF YOU GO TO YOU SEE CSU YOU'RE FORCED. CONNECTIONS FACULTY ARE ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON CAMPUS AND HAVING FACULTY WERE IT AS DIVERSE AS THE POPULATION IS. ALLOWS US TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ESPECIALLY IN CAR TAX OUT OF TO US- I CAN'T. TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN SOMEBODY COME UP TO ME AND TALK ABOUT HOW THIS ONE PERFECT. TOUGHEST DOCTOR HE WAS THE INTEREST IN BUT NOW AFTER THE TAUGHT. ME THAT WAS RELEVANT TO WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES ARE THEY FELT LIKE THEY HAD MONEY OR BY AN AND MUCH MORE BELIEF I BELIEVE IT WAS THE PRESENT. IMAGINE THAT AS THE WORLD. I REALLY THOUGHT WAS A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING IT. THE IMPACT ON SUCCESS MAJORS IN GRADES HAS ALREADY BEEN ELABORATED ON. BUT MORE HOLISTICALLY ALSO AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO SIX OUR ABILITY FEEL CONFIDENT AS LEADERS THESE YEARS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHERE YOU'RE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT CAN BE. YOU CAN SEE YOUR SUCCESSFUL LATER PATHWAYS AND- SO- GAINING THE CONFIDENCE IN FUELING YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL IMPACT THE WAY THAT STUDENTS DO WHEN THEY HAVE A MORE DIVERSE- FOR FORTY WHO WELCOMES THE MEN ISRAEL CRUCIAL- WITH REGARDS TO SOLUTIONS I THINK A LOT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. I THINK ALIVE BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY. THE ONES THAT STUCK OUT TO ME ARE OBVIOUSLY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DIVERSE FACULTY IT'S NOT THE EASIEST SOLUTION BUT I DO THINK IT'S SIMPLE THIS AND I THINK AS A STUDENT THAT'S THE ONE THEY'LL HAVE THE MOST DIRECT AFFECT MY ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK SOMETHING ELSE I SHOULD BE MANY. ACCOUNTS LORS COACHES WHOEVER HAS OF OUTWARD SING ROLE THAT DIRECTOR. NOT JUST INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY BUT ALSO INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MAYBE. CULTURAL SENSITIVITY TRAINING STUFF LIKE THAT THOSE MISSION IS ALSO CRUCIAL SO THAT THE UNDERSTAND MAYBE THE BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCES THAT WE ALL LIVE IN. ANOTHER THING THAT I THOUGHT I'D FINALLY AND WITH IS MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE ME ONCE FOR EXAMPLE- I'M A NORTH AFRICAN. ART I'M NORTH UP THE CENTER SO SINCE THE ARAB. NO WE'RE REALLY IN THIS CONVERSATION DOES IT SEEM LIKE I MAYBE FIT IN THIS CONTEXT RIGHT. SOMETIMES WE TAKE LONG BEEN ASIAN AS THIS ONE BIG GROUP. SOUTH ASIAN IN EAST ASIA. RIGHT DIFFERENT. IS COMING UP IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT THIS BUDGET. ARM WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE SET UP. MORE GETTING MORE CORRECT WITH. A CAMBODIAN ORAL SURGEON STUDENT IS IN ONE. EXPERIENCES CHINA. ALREADY THE WERE. WONDERFUL IT'S READ. ALL THESE. LINES COMING TOGETHER TO SEE HOW THEY CAN SOLVE SUCH A VITAL ISSUE. BUT MORE GRANULARITY MORE NEW WANTS AND MORE THE SAME WHICH IS BRING TOGETHER MEETING OF THE MINDS TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. YOU. IT IS AFTER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA ASSEMBLY PERSON GARCIA- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UNLESS STAFF I AM JOHN. RESIDENTS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I ROLE I AM TO REPRESENT ALL THE FACULTY STONE. IN ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER THE DON'T ASK ME ABOUT HOW MUCH PEOPLE GET PAID. OKAY. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ALREADY AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH CROSS OUT THINGS ON MY NOW SO AS NOT TO MENTION. SO I HOPE THAT I CAN PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TAXED FOR I KNOW I AM STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND LUNCH SEC. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE ACCURATE AND IT HAS. HAS EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN AND DESIRE TO LEAD CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR RANKS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN WE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP TWO OH NINE. A AND HOW THAT WOULD THAT AFFECT. OUR ABILITY TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WE WERE PART OF THE TASK FORCE THAT FAILED. WITH THE FIRST OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE NEW E. GUIDELINES AND PROVIDING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS STATE. AS A BASELINE. THE WE NEED WASN'T. THIS WAS A STAFF. ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT APPEARED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUT WE APPROACH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE SUMMER. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HOW YOU RECALL THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT TIME FOR THOSE OF US WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND ASKED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO WORK WITH US AND MAKE THIS A PRIORITY THAT MY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. WHO ON YOUR HAND OUT THIS IS US SO THIS IS. THIS IS WHO WE ARE. IMPLEMENTED SOME GOALS WHAT WE WISH TO WORK ON- AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP FOR THE SYSTEM FOR AND OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL WAS THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR RANKS AND WE SAID THIS WOULD NEED TO BE A GOAL FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS IF WHAT HAPPENED. BECAUSE WE TALK. STEM CULTURE CHANGE. WAS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERY SYSTEM REFLECTS THE INHERENT BIAS OF THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION INCLUDING OURS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND EACH OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND THAT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO RESIST CHANGE IF LEFT ON THEIR OWN. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IN THE CAPACITY OF EVERYONE TO LEARN AND GROW INCLUDING OURSELVES AND THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN WHICH WE WORK. THE FACULTY THAT I SPEAK TO OUR CALL TO TEACHER. THEY FEEL A DESIRE TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS. ALL OF US WANT TO DO THAT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND WHEN WE GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT. IT USUALLY A FUNCTION OF. HOW CAN WE DO. HOW CAN WE EMPOWER PEOPLE TO MAKE CHANGES. SOME OF THE WORK I'M- YOU HEARD FROM- DOCTOR DAISY GONZALEZ- EARLIER THAT- WE ARE PARTNERED WITH HER OFFICE TO A CO CHAIRED THE TASK FORCE AND THE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT WE WISH TO IMPLEMENT. WE WENT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING AND MY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED ME TO SEE THIS. THIS IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET THIS IS THAT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. OVER THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT YOU HEARD FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A CONSISTENT WAY. HI ONCE AND DONE BUT OVER TIME TO IMPLEMENT A CULTURE CHANGE THE WORK THAT THE SENATE HAS SAID THAT IT NEEDS TO LEAD AND HAS ASKED OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS TO INVITED THEM TO COME IN AND APPOINT PEOPLE AND HELP US TO IT- INCLUDE. EVE OUT. SECOND AMONG QUALIFICATION THAT WE JUST ABOUT SUCH THAT ITS VALUE IS EQUAL TO DISTANCE DISCIPLINE SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS THERE ARE TWO MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR FACULTY. YOU SHOULD MEET BOTH. I'M TO TEACH IN THE SYSTEM AND ONE SHOULD NOT BE MORE VALUABLE THAN THE OTHER. IS TO CREATE WITH OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS AT MODEL HIRING AN APPOINTMENT PROCESSES- AS TOOLS THE COLLEGES CAN USE- AND THESE ARE ALL. IN THE HUNDRED. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DOCTOR GONZALEZ MENTIONED EARLIER. ALSO TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO ENGAGE COLLEGES AND SYSTEMIC CHANGE DIALOGUE. THIS IS- OUR LOCAL ACADEMIC SENATE PRESIDENTS COME FROM ALL KINDS OF DISCIPLINES AND MAY NOT BE AS PROFICIENT ABOUT THAT THE DELEGATES THAT THEY SEND THEIR SENATE PRESIDENT'S THEY COME TO OUR PLENARY SESSION HAVE TOLD US THIS. TO THEM AND THEY WANT TO DO THAT. BUT THE CONTROLS TO HELP THAT. LIKE THEY CAN FACILITATE A DIALOGUE BUT THEY NEED SOME STRUCTURE AROUND THAT SO THE STATE WIDE ACADEMICS AND IT IS ATTEMPTING TO BUILD THOSE. FOR THEM AND TO WORK WITH THAT THE FIRST OFFICE TO EVALUATE AND REVISE OUR E. OF STANDARDS. THAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND- THEN THE MOTHER MEASURE WE ASK COLLEGES TO DO. WE KNEW THAT AS A BASELINE. EVERYONE HAS THE BASELINE THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO MOVE TO THE NEXT STOP. I IN OUR PROGRESS. SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE ALSO DONE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO HEAR IS A SELF EXAMINATION OF OUR OWN GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AS THE- BASE OF FACULTY AND ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL MATTERS. IF YOU ALL HAVE THIS CHART HERE IT MAY NOT SEEM SUPER IMPRESSIVE TO YOU I BUT WE HAVE MADE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FACULTY AND INVITE THEM INTO THE GOVERNANCE DIALOGUE. THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM- DOCTOR FAVIO GONZALEZ THAT THAT SOMETIMES THAT INVITATION IS LACKING OR PERCEIVED AS NOT TO ME AND SO WE HAVE MADE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO PARTNER WITH OTHER GROUPS WHERE WE- GROUPS OF FACULTY ARE MORE DIVERSE ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM. AND ASK THEM TO PARTICIPATE. ALL OF THEM WE NEED ALL THE VOICE. TO SERVE ALL THE STUDENTS. WE TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST WHICH IS WHEN WE FINALIZE OUR STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO APPOINT A THOUSAND PEOPLE. BUT BUT WE'VE BEEN TAKING A SNAPSHOT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEES AND STANDING APPOINTMENTS. THIS NUMBER OF THE TOTAL APPLICANT POOL IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT IF YOU RESET EVERY ACADEMIC YEAR IT'LL OF AUGUST IS NOT AN OPPORTUNE TIME. COLLECTED MATCH IS USUALLY AROUND A HUNDRED BUT THIS PAST YEAR WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR. I WOULD HOPE AS A RESULT OF OUR DIRECT- ASKING PEOPLE TO DISSIPATE AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE APPLICANT POOL VERSUS THE PERCENTAGE UP TO IT. LIKE IS IT PERFECT. IS IT- AND IMPROVEMENTS YES I THINK IT IS. WHEN WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND MONITOR OUR OWN PROCESSES AS AN EXAMPLE TO LOCAL SENATE'S OF WHAT THEY CAN'T. AROUND THAT. I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME FOR QUESTIONS. SO I THINK I'LL STOP. THANK YOU. I WOULD SAY. THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE THE MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD- IN SACRAMENTO- OVER THE YEARS I'VE I THINK MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR AND I KNOW FROM THOSE MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD IN SACRAMENTO THAT. FACULTY THIS. ACADEMIC A PRIORITY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT IN THE IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE FOLKS WHEN YOU COME TO VISIT WITH ME. AND I'VE I'VE HEARD. AND I APPLAUD THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE DIVERSITY OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE ITSELF. USING THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES NUMBERS IN YOUR YOUR OWN NUMBER. I'M GLAD YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE ACADEMIC COURSE STUFF AND THAT YOU ARE MAKING IT PROVED MEN'S IS A KNOWLEDGE. AND I AND I REALLY DO THINK THAT IS A STEP FORWARD SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GROUP OF FACULTY WHO ALREADY NOT VERY DIVERSE AND THEN ASKING THEM TO DO MORE. AND WE KNOW THAT IF CAUGHT. ON AT EVERY LEVEL. TAXED HIGHER IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACT AS MENTORS TO STUDENTS AND THEN YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO DO MORE SO I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ACADEMIC SENATE BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT'LL HELP. RIGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. FIVE THANK YOU INTO IT I THINK MY QUESTION THIS ONLINE WITH. YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WE THINK A POPULAR SAYS THAT YOU'RE ASKING. IN A BATTLE TO. OKAY. AND WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO MORE. ARE YOU WHERE THIS TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTED AND THAT EMPOWERED WAS THERE TO BILL LIKE TO ACTUALLY BE HEARD OR TAKING LEADERSHIP ROLES IS A LOT OF I'VE BEEN INVITED. TO TAKE OFF THE BOX WITHIN THE TO SUNSET THAT. IN NINETEEN IS THAT IS SO ARE YOU HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NEXT STEP. THAT IS NOT JUST AN INVITATION BUT IT'S AN EMPOWERMENT AND THEN A SUPPORT FOR. US SEC I EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHOSE PICTURED ON THE FRONT THERE MIGHT- BE GLAD AND LEAVING SAN FROM THIS ROLE- BUT I HAVE ASKED THEM TO CO TWO ORIENTATION.
