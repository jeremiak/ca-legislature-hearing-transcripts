I ASKED HER WHAT IS THAT. SHE SAID. BEING A MOM IS HAVING TO LEARN TO LET GO. THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY. YOU CARRY YOUR BABY FOR NINE MONTHS. YOU GIVE BIRTH AND YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO. SOON HE'S TODDLING ALONG HOLDING YOUR FINGER. THEN IN NO TIME SHE IS RUNNING OFF AND YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO. THE DAY COMES WHEN THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF THE BIKE.

THEN THEY GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE GO OFF TO COLLEGE. AND THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE SAID. NOW MY BABY IS GOING TO FRANCE AND I HAVE TO LET HER GO. I LISTENED TO MY SISTER SHARE THIS WITH ME THAT EARLY MORNING. THEN I SAID TO HER. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT AS I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. IT'S NOT JUST BEING A MOM. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING IN LIVING LIFE. WE'RE ALWAYS HAVING TO LET GO. I NEED A LIFE. NOTHING CAN LAST FOREVER. SO IN LIVING LIFE. WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO LEARN TO LET GO. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. I'VE COME TO FEEL THAT DE. DEEP IN A LOVING PARENTS HARD. THEY WILL NEVER LET GO. IT WILL FOREVER BE WORRYING ABOUT. CARING FOR AND LOVING THEIR CHILDREN.

INCREASINGLY DOCUMENTS CAN BE PROVIDED BY ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS IN A MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER BY MAIL AND IN SOME INSTANCES ELECTRONICALLY. UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAW IS WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE. AS A RESULT COUNTY ASSESSOR STAFF MAY TRAVEL TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE STATE TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DO THEIR JOB. EVEN THOUGH THE INFORMATION COULD BE MAILED OR PERHAPS TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY. SIMILARLY WHY TAXPAYER NEEDS INFORMATION FROM AN ASSESSOR OFFICE THE TAXPAYER TRAVELS TO AND MAY HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE AT A COUNTY OFFICE. THIS BILL CREATES A RECIPROCAL RIGHT OF AN ASSESSOR OR TAXPAYER TO REQUEST THE INFORMATION BE MAILED TO THEM OR SENT ELECTRONICALLY IF AVAILABLE.

THIS ASSURES CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED FROM ACTIONS THAT GIVE ONE SIDE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OR PRACTICES THAT COMPROMISE THE NEUTRAL CARE OF THE COURT REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT. CONTRARY TO OPPOSITION THE BOARD AND LICENSE OWNED FIRMS CAN ATTEST TO NUMEROUS ABUSES FROM OUT OF STATE DEPOSITION FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COURT REPORTING SERVICES. THESE ENTITIES USED LICENSE COURT REPORTERS BUT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR BUSINESS HAVE DIRECT HANDLING OF THE TRANSCRIPT IN A MANNER THAT BREAKS COURT REPORTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY THAT PRACTICE FOR OVER ELEVEN YEARS I CAN ATTEST THE FACT THAT IT'S CRITICAL. THE TRANSCRIPTS ARE. HELD IN A WAY THAT. FIRMS INTEGRITY AND THAT THERE'S A CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THEM THAT CAN BE RELIED UPON BY ALL PARTIES. AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR CREATES A LEGAL PATHWAY FOR THESE UNREGULATED AT A STATE DEPOSITION FIRMS TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT BRINGS PARITY WITH OTHER SIMILAR COURT REPORTER PROVIDERS. AND THE SAME AT A STATE BERMS DOES STATES REQUIRE IT OF FIRMS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS TRULY ABOUT A BILL ABOUT PARITY IN ENSURING. THE QUALITY OF OF COURT REPORTING SERVICES HAS A LEVEL INTEGRITY WE ALL EXPECT EXPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. FAMOUS COLLAR MS BAKER DIRECTOR THAT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISING AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR IS IDENTICAL TO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN I THINK RIGHTLY SO IN HIS VETO MESSAGE HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS VERY ISSUE IS THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LITIGATION. THAT LITIGATION CONTINUES AND HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED AND WILL ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO PASS THIS AND COMPLETELY HAVE TO UNRAVEL. OF TREMENDOUSLY BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS WE PUT ON. CERTAIN SERVICE COMPANIES TO OPERATE IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE I AM AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE HIS BODY TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION OF NOT INTERFERING WITH PENDING LITIGATION. PICKING ONE FAVORED OVER THE OTHER ALLOW THAT PROCESS IN A CO EQUAL BRANCH TO WORK ITSELF OUT AND THEN WE CAN ALWAYS BE RESPONSIVE AS NECESSARY IF WE DISAGREE WITH THE OUTCOME OF THAT COURT. RULING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THING IS BAKER. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE VIEW WHICH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FIRST OF ALL OF THIS IS NOT REQUIRE ANYTHING OVER THE BURDENSOME REQUIRES THE EXACT SAME THING THAT OUR CALIFORNIA FIRMS HAVE TO ABIDE BY. SECONDLY IN TERMS LITIGATION OF THE LITIGATION IS NOT RELEVANT TO THIS BILL NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LITIGATION. THIS BILL WOULD STILL BE NECESSARY I AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.

YOU DIG YOUR OLD MISSION IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES THAT IN VERY DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. TO INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. NOW I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT THEY BELIEVE FOR. THESE REMARKS. ARAB. CLARIFY THOSE CONCERNS. AND THAT IS THAT THE BILL WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EXPAND LITIGATION OR SEEK. EXCESSIVE PENALTIES TO FUND THE WORK. BUREAU. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. FUNDS ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THAT COLLECT SETTLEMENTS OF PENALTIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. OBVIATES WORK AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE FUNDS OR THE USE OF THE SETTLEMENT REVENUES TO FUND THE WORK HAS. INDUCED EXCESSIVE LITIGATION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YET PLACENTA ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THE BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THIS WAS A CRITICAL STEP FOR THE EDA MOVEMENT AND CEMENTED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S ROLE. IN FOCUSING ON INVESTIGATING AND LITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS IN OUR MOST DISENFRANCHISED AND POLLUTED COMMUNITIES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE AS A STAY PRIORITIZE STANDING UP. FOR THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL BEFORE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FOR EVERYONE AND ASSURING THAT YOUR ZIP CODE DOES NOT DICTATE YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE. AND CLEAN WATER TO DRINK. BY CREATING AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FUND WITHIN THE STATE TREASURY WE'RE PROVIDING THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH ANOTHER TOOL TO HELP PROTECT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES.

UNDER CURRENT LAW CANNABIS TESTING LABORATORIES CAN ACCEPT SAMPLES FROM EITHER A LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESS. OR A MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT OR CAREGIVER WHO GROWS PLANTS FOR THEIR PERSONAL USE.

KNOWS ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. VIOLATE ONE TWENTY EIGHT PASS RETAIN THAT BRINGS US TO. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE TWENTY NINE. A. B. THIRTY THIRTY FOUR. WE HAVE AMENDMENTS AT THE DESK CLERK READ. SO WE WILL THIRTY THIRTY FOUR WITH AMENDMENTS BY SOME MEMBER BAKER. MS BAKER ON THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM CUPERTINO FOR BRINGING THE UNDERLYING MEASURE AB THIRTY THIRTY FOUR FORWARD. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THIS SET OF AMENDMENTS TO ENHANCE WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT GOAL WHICH IS TO REDUCE LABOR STRIFE AYE WITHIN THE BART SYSTEM IN THE BAY AREA. AND TO ENSURE THAT IT'S LESS LIKELY IN THE FUTURE THAT WE RELIVE THE STRIKES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE BAY AREA IN THE PAST I KNOW THE AUTHORS. A VERY WELL WRITTEN ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL MENTIONS THAT THE TWENTY THIRTEEN BART STRIKES THERE WERE TWO OF THEM WERE AN INSPIRATION FOR THIS SPELL. AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STE TO HAVE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE BILL REACHED. BART IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF BAY AREA TRANSPORTATION OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY RELY ON BART TO GET TO WORK SEE THEIR DOCTOR GET TO SCHOOL ENGAGING LIFE IN THE BAY AREA. AND EVERY DAY WRITERS COME FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA NORTH. EAST SOUTH. AND BART IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO BAY AREA MOBILITY AND I THINK PUBLIC SAFETY. WITHOUT BART WORKER SHOWING UP TO DO THEIR JOBS AND CONTINUING TO ENSURE THAT PART HAS CONTINUOUS UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE PART IS NOT THE LIFE LINE IT NEEDS TO BE FOR THE BAY AREA. NOW IS OUR. GOOD COLLEGE IN CUPERTINO HAS MENTIONED IN HIS WRITTEN SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THE INSPIRATION FOR THE UNDERLYING BILL IS TO PREVENT FUTURE BART STRIKES. EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA GOT A TERRIBLE REMINDER OF THE NEED TO DO THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE STRIKES CAME FORWARD. AND IT BROUGHT THE ENTIRE BAY AREA TO A GRINDING HALT WE LOST SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A DAY. IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FROM BART STRIKES EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE CARS REPORT ON THE ROADS AS ARE AIRIES ROADS FREEWAYS AND OTHER SYSTEMS WERE. COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED SIXTEEN MILLION POUNDS OF CARBON WERE RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ON A DAILY BASIS FROM THE BART STRIKES. AND. THE UNDERLYING BILL DOESN'T PREVENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE STRIKES TO HAPPEN IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE OFTEN CONFRONTED WITH AND THAT'S THIS. BART WORKERS ALREADY AGREED IN THEIR CONTRACT NOT TO STRIKE. THEY HAVE A NO STRIKE CLAUSE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE NEGOTIATIONS GO FORWARD AND THE CONTRACT EXPIRES? DURING THAT EXPIRATION PERIOD BART CONTINUES TO PAY THEIR WORKERS THEIR WAGES HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY AND THEIR PENSION BENEFITS. BUT BART DOES NOT BELIEVE OF THE BART WORKERS DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO HONOR THE NO STRIKE CLAUSE. DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS SO THE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THEY DON'T THINK THEY HAVE TO HONOR THE NO STRIKE BECAUSE BUT THEY CONTINUE TO BE PAID UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT THAT THEY SAY HAS EXPIRED. THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY FIXES THAT IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO BOTH THE WRITERS AND THE WORKERS. IT SAYS ONLY THIS IF YOU'RE PART UNION HAS ALREADY AGREED NOT TO STRIKE. IT DOESN'T IMPOSE A NO STRIKE CLAUSE ON THEM IT'S ONE THAT THEY AGREED TO AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE PAID. AFTER THE CONTRACT HAS EXPIRED THEY CONTINUE TO GET THE BENEFITS OF THAT CONTRACT THEY HAVE TO HONOR THE NO STRIKE CLAUSE THE NEGOTIATED. THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO CONTINUE SERVICE AT PART AND MAKE SURE THAT THE LABOR MANAGEMENT STRIFE THAT OUT BECAUSE THE STRIKES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE NOT REPEATED AGAIN. WITH GREAT GREAT RESPECT FOR COLLEGE IN CUPERTINO IS BRINGING FORWARD THE RIGHT ISSUE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THESE MOMENTS. THANK YOU THIS BAKER MISTER CALDERON. MOVED TO LAY THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE MISTER CALDERON MOVES A LADY AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE SECONDED BY MISTER BONTA MEMBERS IS A PROCEDURAL VOTE ON LAINEY AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE. THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE MISTER CALDERON IS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE AND MS. BAKER'S ASKING FOR NO MISTER CALDERON IS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TAKES MAJORITY PRESENT AND VOTING. CLERK WILL. CLOSER ROLE AND TALLY THE VOTE EYES FORTY FOUR KNOWS TWENTY TO THE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID ON THE TABLE. WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF AMENDMENTS ON THIS ITEM. CORKERY. SO ME PROPERLY THIRTY FORMER THE MINUTES BY SOME THE RIVER BAKER. IS BAKER ON THE MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THESE AMENDMENTS AND OFFER THEM AGAIN TO ENHANCE OF THE STATED GOAL OF THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATION WHICH AGAIN IS A VERY GOOD GOAL AND I APPRECIATE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CUPERTINO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND THAT IS TO ADDRESS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ALSO CONTINUES TO CAUSE LABOR MANAGEMENT STRIFE WITHIN PART. AND TO HEIGHTEN THE A LIKELIHOOD OF A STRIKE AND THE DISRUPTION FROM THE STRIKE UNDER CURRENT LAW AND CONTRACTS. BART MANAGEMENT IS PROHIBITED. FROM TAKING ANY ACTION TO PREPARE FOR AN IMMINENT STRIKE UNTIL THE STRIKE HAS HAPPENED AND WORK HAS STOPPED THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TRAIN THEMSELVES TO OPERATE THE TRAINS THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO. A MAKE PREPARATIONS TO HAVE A SKELETAL A TRAIN SYSTEM OPERATIONAL AND CREW AVAILABLE NOT ONLY FOR MOST BASIC AND SKELETAL OPERATIONS BUT FOR SAFETY. I'M WITH THIS MAJOR DOES IS IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THAT PART CAN ENTER NO CONTRACT. IN THE FUTURE WHICH WILL PREVENT THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO PLAN FOR A WORK STOPPAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS IMPOSING UPON BAY AREA RESIDENTS I NEED THAT A STRIKE HOUSE TO START. BEFORE ANYONE CAN LIFT A FINGER TO TRY TO AMELIORATE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE WAY IT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S LIVES A IS THE NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THESE MOMENTS. CALDERON FOR A PURPOSE MOVED TO LAY THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLES CALDERON MOVES LADY MEMBERS ON TABLE THE SECOND BY MISTER BONTA MEMBERS AGAIN A PROCEDURAL VOTE MAJORITY PRESIDENT VOTING. ON LAINEY MEMBERS ON THE TABLE CLERK WILL OPEN ALL. CALDERON IS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. MS BAKER NOW IS CALDERON IS ASKING FOR MY VOTE. MAJORITY PRESIDENT VOTING. CALDERON IS ASKING FOR DIMAS BAKER'S ASKING FOR NO. CLARK WELL. CLOSE ROLL EYES FORTY SIX KNOWS TWENTY ONE. THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID ON THE TABLE. NOW TO THE BILL AND CHIEF THIS IS AB THIRTY THIRTY FOUR BY MR LOW CORKERY. SO WE WILL THIRTY THIRTY FOUR BY SOME REMEMBER LOW AND ACT LIKE PUBLIC TRANSIT. MR LOW EMAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D WHILE I DO NOT APPRECIATE THESE HOSTILE AMENDMENTS BEING PROPOSED I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE BILL IN CHIEF. OF THIS BILL GIVES THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD JURISDICTION OVER LABOR DISPUTES FOR THE SUPER ZORI UNIT OF PART. BY MOVING EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS FOR THE SUPERVISORY UNITS ARE WE TALKED AND HEARD ABOUT THE LABOR DISPUTES AT THAT HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS BILL WILL HELP THOSE LABOR DISPUTES. IN CHIEF AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER LOVE MS BAKER YOUR RECORD NEXT THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO. THIRTY THIRTYFOUR AND ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTES AND AGAIN THAT THE BILL ABSOLUTELY HAS THE RIGHT GOAL WHICH IS TO REDUCE. US STRIFE BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND LABOR AT PART HAVE MORE HOPE HARMONIOUS WAY HAVE. THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND ALSO ULTIMATELY TO PREVENT PREVENT FUTURE WORK STOPPAGES UNFORTUNATELY I'M I I BELIEVE. THAT THE BILL CAN AND WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT AND HERE IS HOW. I AM RIGHT NOW BAR IS GOVERNED BY THE PART ACT WHICH SPECIFIES HOW LABOR DISPUTES INCLUDING MID CONTRACT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED WE ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACT PERIOD WITH PART. OF THEIR CONTRACTS RENEWED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY DON'T EXPIRE UNTIL I BELIEVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES THAT LABOR AND MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO RESOLVE THEY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT. MAYBE HOW WORKERS ARE CLASSIFIED A WHAT OURS WILL BE APPLIED. WHAT PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR TRAINING? UNDER THE BARD ACTS. WORK CONTINUES BART CONTINUES TO OPERATE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY OF THE QUESTIONS REMAINING BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND LABOR CONTINUE TO BE A RESOLVED. UNTIL THE NEGOTIATIONS RESOLVE IT THAT MEANS THERE ISN'T A WORK STOPPAGE IF WE PASS THIS BILL. AND PER HERB IS THE ENTITY THAT IT OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WILL GOVERN THIS PARTICULAR UNIT THERE CAN AND WILL BE WORK STOPPAGES AND PROBABLY THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO. EXPLAIN THAT IS BY DEMONSTRATION SO CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW PARTISAN TO GOING A SEISMIC SAFETY RETROFIT OF THE TRANSBAY TO. THIS IS THE ONE CONNECTION BETWEEN BART ACROSS THE BAY AREA. IT'S CRITICAL AND IT IS A BOTTLENECK THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT THAT NEED TO OCCUR RELATED TO THE WORK THAT WILL BE DONE ON THAT SEISMIC RETROFIT. THE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HOURS BART WILL BE SHUT DOWN IT'S CALLED THE BLANKET THE HOURS OF NO OPERATION FOR WORKERS TO GO THROUGH AND DO THE WORK. IT ALSO INCLUDES WHO WILL BE CATEGORIZED AS SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITIONS AND A FEDERAL LAW WILL APPLY. THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT LABOR AND MANAGEMENT NEED TO WORK OUT UNDER EXISTING LAW THEY CAN WORK THEM OUT WHILE THE SAFETY RETROFIT OF THE TRANSBAY TO WHICH IS CRITICAL. CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IF THIS BILL PASSES. THAT WORK WILL STOP BECAUSE A NEW FACT FINDING PROCESS WILL NEED TO BEGIN BEFORE ANY FURTHER WORK CAN CONTINUE AND THAT PROCESS WHILE TECHNICALLY ON THE BOOKS IS SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR SEVERAL DAYS. CAN LAST TYPICALLY THREE TO SIX MONTHS THAT MEANS TRANSBAY TUBE SAFETY WORK WILL NOT HAPPEN. BART WILL BE DELAYED IN DOING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS LEGISLATION. GIVE A SECOND EXAMPLE. CRITICAL TO BART HAVING OF THE. GREATEST CAPACITY THAT IT NEEDS I THINK ALL BAY AREA RESIDENTS REALIZE PART NEEDS GREATER CAPACITY THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF NEW TRAINS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY NEW TRAINS THESE TRAINS HAVE COMPUTERIZED. MONITORING AND TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE PART OF THEM. IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW COMPUTERIZED TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM REQUIRES NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WILL BE TRAINED WHO WILL OWN. OPERATE AT THE NEW CONTROL CENTERS WHAT WILL THE WORK CONDITIONS BE UNDER EXISTING LAW. THOSE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE WORKED OUT WITH LESS STRIFE WHILE THE WORK CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT THE TRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS UNDER THIS BILL THE WORK WILL STOP. AND THAT MEANS THAT BART WILL NOT HAVE THE FULL CAPACITY IT IS TRYING TO GET FROM THE NEW TRAINS THAT THIS BODY IS PUTTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO. THEN NEEDED CAPACITY ACROSS THE TRANSBAY TUBE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO INCREASE BY THIRTY PERCENT IF THESE TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE PUT INTO PLACE WILL NOT HAPPEN THIRTY SECONDS OR SO. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO LEAVE EXISTING LAW THE WAY IT IS. BECAUSE WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO CREATE STRIFE AND LABOR STOPPAGES INSTEAD OF THE WORK CONTINUES AND FINALLY THERE ARE FIVE. UNIONS RELATED TO BART THIS PROVISION WILL ONLY APPLY TO ONE OF THEM THE SMALLEST UNION SO THAT WHEN WE COME TO A CONTRACT. EXPIRATION PERIOD WILL HAVE DIFFERENT RULES FOR HOW CONTINUING LABOR NEGOTIATIONS HAVE TO GO FORWARD. WILL IT STOP. ALL MANNER OF NEGOTIATIONS AND WORK WELL THERE'S A STRIKE OR WILL YOU CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK. THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE BAY AREA I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO CLARIFY SOME THINGS I HEARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT WORK STOPPAGES. ANY TIME WORKERS ARE UNDER A CONTRACT THEY CANNOT STRIKE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE SUBJECT TO THE P. YOU SEE IS A PART WORKERS ARE CURRENTLY AND HAVE TO TAKE ANY MATTERS TO COURT OR IF THEY'RE SUBJECT TO PER. WHAT PROOF DOES IS ACTUALLY DE ESCALATE ISSUES BETWEEN MANAGEMENT LABOR BY WORKING IT OUT AND IT'S TOUGH IT AT? TRIED WAY AWAY THAT ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE A VAST MAJORITY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY HAVE TO WORK OUT DISPUTES. IT TO SUGGEST THAT IF THERE ARE SAFETY REGULATIONS MOVING FORWARD AND THE UNION REPRESENTING THE WORKERS THINK THAT MAYBE THERE OUR REGULATIONS THAT NEED BE IT HERE TO TO KEEP THOSE WORKER SAFE. THAT THE WAY TO WORK IT OUT IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK IN AN UNSAFE WAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEN THE WORK GETS DONE. AYE I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH THAT ANY UNION OR ANY A. FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTECT BOTH WORKERS AND THE WORK GETTING DONE SHOULD WANT SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE ALL IT DOES IS TAKE PART THIS PART BART. BARGAINING UNIT AND TAKE IT OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE WHICH IS AN INAPPROPRIATE PLACE TO HANDLE ANY KIND OF LABOR RELATIONS IT ACTUALLY PUSHES IT TO COURT. AND IT MOVES IT SUPERB WHICH A MAJORITY OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OUR RD UNDER YOU DON'T SEE MASSIVE WORK STOPPAGES HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACT BECAUSE IT CAN'T HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE THE CONTRACT. PERV INSURES THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONTRACT WILL THEY STOP WORK IF THERE IS A A DISPUTE OVER WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS WELL THEY SAY THAT YOU CAN'T GO ON. AHEAD WITH UNSAFE WORK CONDITIONS YEAH THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AND THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING FOR ALL OF US SOMEONE BE CLEAR WHEN I'M THE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM THE EAST BAY WAS HOW ABOUT WORK STOPPAGES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT STRIKES STATS ILLEGAL. WHEN YOU HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE IN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE BARGAINING UNITS THAT MAYBE UNDER DIFFERENT FORMS THAT'S THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE FACE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S. ABOUT ARGUMENT VOTE THIS BILL DOWN THIS MAKES SENSE IT'S GOOD FOR THE WORKERS ENHANCE ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THE MANAGEMENT AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS EIGHT IS SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. MISTER LOW YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I JUST A FUNDAMENTALLY OF THE RIGHT TO STRIKE IS OF FUNDAMENTAL LABOR PROTECTION AND THE HOSTILE AMENDMENTS WOULD HAVE OUTLAWED OF SUCH AN ACT. THIS IS ALSO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OF PRECEDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE LEGISLATURE TRANSFERRED JURISDICTION OF. SUCH LABOR DISPUTES REGARDING THIS SUPERVISORS BARGAINING UNITS AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY PHILIP YOU SEE TO PROBE AND ASSEMBLY BILL THEN OUT ONE NINETY NINE SO THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR THIS. AND THIS IS A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE A TO ENSURING THAT THERE IS NOT THIS LABOR STRIFE THAT WE SEE IN THIS AREA I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT VOTE.

TWO YEARS AGO THE UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION A NON PARTISAN ADVISORY GROUP AUTHORIZED A REVISION OF THE EPA. TO ENSURE EQUAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN OF SAME SEX COUPLES.

THEN DESIGNATE MAY FIRST OF INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE. YES MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO ISSUES AT HAND HERE WITH THIS BILL ONE IS THE ISSUE. OF THE NEW HOLIDAY INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY. AND THE OTHER OF COMBINING DAYS THAT WE TAKE. SET ASIDE EACH YEAR TO RECOGNIZE TWO VERY IMPORTANT PRESIDENTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. NOW WE ALREADY HAVE A DAY WHERE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF. THE LABOR MOVEMENT RIGHT IT'S CALLED LABOR DAY. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. OF LABOR DAY LABOR DAY CAME ABOUT SHORTLY AFTER FACT IN THE SAME YEAR. THAT THE PULLMAN STRIKE WAS TAKING PLACE. AND DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT GROVER CLEVELAND DECIDED TO SEND IN TWELVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS. TO BREAK UP TO STRIKE TWO WORKERS WERE KILLED THERE WAS SUCH A PUBLIC OUTCRY. THAT WE THEN HAD LABOR DAY. A DAY THAT IS SET ASIDE TO RECOGNIZE THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS FARE OURS FOR WAGES FOR PAY. THAT IS ALL ENCOMPASSED IN LABOR DAY. WE HAVE TWO DAYS A YEAR WHERE WE RECOGNIZE. TWO VERY IMPORTANT PRESIDENT'S OUR NATION'S HISTORY VERY SPECIFICALLY THOUGH. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT LINCOLN. WHO WERE IT NOT FOR HIM IN HIS LEADERSHIP? ABOUT SLAVERY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED. SO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A DAY. THAT IS SET ASIDE WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS EDUCATION SYSTEM WITHIN THEIR CURRICULUM WHERE TEACHERS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS. THE CONTRIBUTION TO PRESIDENT LINCOLN THE GROUNDWORK HE LAID. FOR THIS COUNTRY TO EXIST AS IT DOES TODAY WITH THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ALL. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THAT DAY IN COMBINATORICS ANOTHER DAY. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE PRESIDENT DURING TAKE TWO VERY IMPORTANT PRESIDENTS TO OUR HISTORY PUTTING INTO ONE DAY. AND CREATE TWO DAYS. TWO HOLIDAYS FOR THE LABOR MOVEMENT. NOW I WILL REMIND YOU WERE IT NOT FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN THEIR WOULD BE NO LABOR MOVEMENT THERE WOULD BE NO LABOR DAY. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD A BILL THAT DIMINISHES THE INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE A CONTRIBUTION. A PRESIDENT LINCOLN TO THIS COUNTRY VERY SPECIFICALLY. TO THE HISTORY OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WHY IS THIS WHY ARE WE STARTING TO WATER DOWN HISTORY? WATER DOWN HISTORY. OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN OUR COUNTRY. AND REPLACE IT WITH THE LABOR DAY. ANOTHER LABOR DAY HOLIDAY I THINK THAT DOES A DISSERVICE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. SPECIFICALLY. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO BE AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO NEED TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. AS THOSE EVER READ BY MORE IMPORTANTLY. THEY MOST CERTAINLY NEED TO HEAR THIS BEING TAUGHT THE CLASS WAS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RECOMBINE THE TWO. YOU GET A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WASHINGTON DID YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT LINCOLN DEAD. BUT YOU GET TWO DAYS OF THE LABOR MEN AND I WOULD ARGUE. THAT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LINCOLN. AND WASHINGTON. CERTAINLY DESERVE THEIR OWN DAY DURING THE YEAR. IN OUR SCHOOLS EDUCATION SYSTEM SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOU KNOW VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH MORE TIME TO IMPLEMENT. THE TRANSITIONS TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS THE ENACTMENT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN SET UP THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH GOVERNS THESE TRANSITIONS. HOWEVER SINCE AB THREE FIFTY BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUND THAT MORE TIME IS OFTEN NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THESE TRANSITIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFTEN NEED MORE TIME TO DO PUBLIC OUTREACH AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN NEED MORE TIME TO HELP UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ORGANIZED NOR TO HELP BETTER. ADVOCATE FOR THEIR INTEREST THIS IS A SITUATION THAT'S BEEN FACED IN MY DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PROSPECTIVELY BY PROVIDING FOR. A MUTUALLY AGREED TO EXTENSION OF NINETY DAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS WOULD REMAIN BARRED FROM COMMENCING LITIGATION AGAINST A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT JUST AS THEY ARE UNDER THE EXISTING THREE FIFTY SYSTEM.

THIS BILL ALSO RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH POLICY COMMITTEES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBER. THIS BILL DOES VERY LITTLE TO REFORM THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL STILL FACE COSTLY LITIGATION IF THEY DO NOT SWITCH. AT LARGE ELECTIONS THEY DO SO UNDER DURESS BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN FACT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OF WHY YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS I SUBVERT. AND. IN IN INSTEAD UNDER DURESS I TRY TO. TO MINIMIZE THEIR LOSSES ARE MINIMIZED. THERE RIGHT THERE THERE'S THEIR THREAT AT THIS ADDED TIME IN THIS BILL ONLY DELAYS THE INEVITABLE. WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE DISCUSSING IS LEGISLATION THAT OFFERS REAL REFORM TO THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT? SUCH AS RAISING THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A DISTRICT BASED ELECTION IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN AN AT LARGE ELECTION.
