00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.940
IS A HARD TO KEEP. EXACTLY AND

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:10.609
I ON. OUR BECAUSE OF FOR

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:13.512
EXAMPLE THE CHIEF JUSTICES- A

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.047
PUSH TO DEAL WITH CRIMINAL

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:16.348
BACKLOG IS GOING TO BE OF

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.517
ASSISTANCE S IT AT WE CAN GET

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.454
IN. AND IN PLACE- CIVIL BACKLOG

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.123
WERE ABLE TO DO A OF SAID.

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:26.292
MATTERS REMOTE HOWEVER CIVIL

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:29.395
JURY TRIALS OBVIOUSLY HAVE- ARE

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.363
AFTER CRIMINAL JURY TRIALS AND

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.766
THEY TAKE MUCH LONGER. TO DO.

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.601
IN ADDITION- PART OF WHAT I

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.202
THINK THE CHIEFS EFFORT OF

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.837
HAVING SETTLEMENT I'M MORE

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.139
INTENSE SETTLEMENTS IS IT

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.540
OFTENTIMES JURY TRIALS DON'T

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.075
SETTLE UNTIL THEY KNOW THERE'S

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.177
A JURY TRIAL AND THEN IT WE ARE

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.945
SCHEDULED. AND WE OBVIOUSLY

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.314
CAN'T DO THAT IN OUR CURRENT

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.749
SITUATION- AND THOUGH WE HAVE

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.685
FOUND- THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.253
OF MATTERS THAT CAN BE HELD

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.988
REMOTELY I THINK THAT WE- ARE

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.256
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BETTER

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.158
SERVE THE PUBLIC. AT EITHER

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.726
CONTINUE REMOTELY OR IN SOME

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.227
HYBRID MANNER AND THEN

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.395
OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:07.266
MOST. CRITICAL TO HAVE FOLKS IN

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:07.800
THE COURT ROOM. AND WHAT

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:09.134
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. SO UNLESS

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.536
THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.603

THEIR CHANGING OPERATION AND

PROGRAM. ANALYSTS ACCESS- SO WE

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.805
HAVE SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.072
THAT WOULD APPLY TO THIS ISSUE

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:57.476
I AM AS WELL AS- THE- RATIONS

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.610
OF THE OTHER ITEMS ON THE

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:00.913
AGENDA. AND SIMPLE FOR YOU YOU

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:02.481
REALLY HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.049
PRIORITIES FOR TRIAL COURT

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.284
OPERATIONS WHICH MIGHT NOT BE

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.252
THE SAME AS A LEGISLATURE IS

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.687
AND SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.089
LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.591
TRIAL COURT FUNDING LEVELS AND

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:14.827
ALLOCATIONS. REALLY ALIGNED

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:17.095
WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.330
THE LEVELS OF SERVICES AND

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.832
DESIRES WHICH CAN INCLUDE

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:21.500
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT COST

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.435
EFFECTIVENESS OR ACCEPTABLE

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.404
LENGTH OF DELAYS AS WELL AS

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.506
EQUITY. AND SO WHEN ENSURING

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.841
THAT THESE FUNDING LEVELS AND

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.642
SERVICE LEVELS MATCH THE

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:31.477
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.145
CONSIDER HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:34.379
FUNDING TO PROVIDE JUST

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.348
GENERALLY RELATIVE TO ITS OTHER

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:38.083
GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES AND THE

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.618
STATE'S OVERALL PHYSICAL

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:42.154
CONDITION. AS WELL AS HOW THE

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.622
FUNDING SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AND

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.724
HOW MUCH DISCRETION TO PROVIDE

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.892
THE TRIAL COURTS OVER THE USE

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.393
OF THE FUNDING SO TO GIVE YOU A

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.128
REALLY QUICK EXAMPLE IF THE

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.830
LEGISLATURE BELIEVES AT THE

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.999
HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO PREVENT

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.501
FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:58.003
LEVELS ARE GROSSLY PADLOCK- THE

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.905
LEGISLATURE COULD REDIRECT ON A

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.340
ONE TIME OR ONGOING BASIS SOME

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:03.408
OF THE MONEY THAT. IS BEING

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.310
PROPOSED FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.078
THAT WILL BE CONSIDERING LATER

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:09.248
TODAY. OR BECAUSE SATISFIED

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.883
FUNDING STORE FOR SPECIFIC

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.651
PURPOSES SUCH AS TO ADDRESS

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.353
PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACTS TO

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:19.758
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING USED.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.159
FOR THAT PURPOSE I THINK LAKE-

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.261
IN LINE WITH THAT THERE THEY'RE

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:22.828
KIND OF. THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.129
WANTED TO FOR ALEXIS

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.431
CONSIDERATION- AS DEPARTMENT OF

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:29.535
FINANCE REFERENCED- JUST

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.003
YESTERDAY A COUPLE DAYS AGO

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.672
THERE'S A THERE'S A PROPOSAL

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:34.172
FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.340
DOLLARS. FOR THE JUDICIAL

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:37.709
BRANCH RESTORING A REDUCTION

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:38.877
THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.646
THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. AND

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:42.447
SO F YOU LOOK ON PAGE THREE OF

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.416
YOUR AGENDA JANUARY BUDGET

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:47.085
INCLUDED SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO

THAT RESTORATION IS APPROVED AT

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:51.823
SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.759
WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT AND

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:56.929
SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON- IN

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.830
IMPROVING SERVICE LEVELS. AND

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.799
THAT THAT RESTORATION IS NOT

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.267
APPROVED AND IT'S JUST A

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:03.835
SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:05.370
WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.105
THAT JUST THAT MONEY WOULD NOT

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:10.275
LIKELY. IMPACT SERVICE LEVELS

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:11.877
SUBSTANTIALLY AND THE REASON

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.780
FOR THAT IS THAT IN THE TWENTY

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:17.049
TWENTY BUDGET. USUAL BRANCH THE

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.016
TRIAL COURT SPECIFICALLY

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:20.218
RECEIVED A ONE TIME FIFTY

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:21.954
MILLION DOLLAR OFFSET AND WITH

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.456
THAT EXPLORATION IN THE BUDGET

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:25.991
YEAR OF THE TRIAL COURTS WOULD

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.492
HAVE HAD TO TAKE ADDITIONAL

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.261
ACTION TO IMPLEMENT IT. AS A

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.463
LARGE SHARE OF THE SEVENTY TWO

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.698
POINT TWO MILLION WOULD LIKELY

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:34.533
HAVE GONE TO AVOID FURTHER

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.468
REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES. AND

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.070
AGAIN THIS IS ABSENCE YOU KNOW

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.771
THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.641
REDUCTION THAT WAS RECENTLY AT

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.209
RETAIL- THE SECOND THAT WE

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.043
WANTED TO FIND FOR THE

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.844
LEGISLATURE IS THAT THE

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.079
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.280
CONSIDER WHETHER TO CHANGE

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:50.616
STATE LAW. TO PROVIDE ONGOING

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.150
AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:53.485
OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:54.486
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:55.487
TRIAL COURT'S DURING THE

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.623
PANDEMIC THEY'RE CURRENTLY-

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.324
DOING SOME OF THESE UNDER

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:01.593
EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION- FOR

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.728
EXAMPLE THE USE OF VIDEO

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.696
CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY. AND

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:07.566
SOME OF THESE THINGS CAN HAVE-

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.834
YOU KNOW CAN HELP THE COURTS

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.002
OPERATE MORE COST EFFECTIVELY

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:11.336
BUT ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.237
COURT SERVICES AND SO THE%

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:13.138
LEGISLATION MIGHT WANT TO

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.773
CONTINUE. MIGHT WANT TO DESIRE

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.575
TO MAINTAIN THEM. AND THE THIRD

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:18.543
AND FINAL THING OF THE JUDICIAL

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.178
BRANCH TALKED A LOT ABOUT KIND

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.513
OF THE INCREASED COSTS AND

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.514
IMPACTS RELATED TO THE

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.216
PANDEMIC. THE THING THAT WE DID

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:25.183
ONE OF LACK OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.352
IS AT THE TOP THE IMPACT OF THE

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.788
PANDEMIC ARE LIKELY TO IMPACT

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.823
SERVICE LEVELS. EVEN BEYOND THE

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.992
BUDGET YEAR DESPITE EFFORTS TO

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.927
KIND OF MINUTE MITIGATE OR OR

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.330
MINIMIZE THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:39.564
ON THE JURY TRIALS YOU'RE

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:40.732
LIKELY TO STILL HAVE BACKLOGS

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.901
IN THOSE AREAS AS WE ARE TRYING

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.903
TO CONDUCT THEM IN A SAFE

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.971
PUBLICLY YOU KNOW PUBLIC

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:49.608
HEALTH- PERMISSIBLE MANNER. AND

00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:51.076
UNCLEAR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.611
FOR US TO RETURN TO NORMAL

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.179
PROCESSING TIMES AS OF THE

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:56.081
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.149
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.317
SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT. OR

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.652
MINIMIZE THOSE LONGER TERM

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:02.220
IMPACTS SUCH AS PROVIDING

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.555
FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.357
ADDITIONAL SPACE OR STAFF TO

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:07.325
CONDUCT JURY TRIALS IN A SAFE

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:08.593
MANNER SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.628
THAT WE WILL OFFER TO THE

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:14.332
LEGISLATURE. FOR KIND OF THEIR

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:14.933
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.736
MUCH. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS-

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.071
ABOUT ONE WOULD BE WHAT WOULD

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:22.541
BE. I DON'T MEAN PIE IN THE SKY

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:23.375
BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:25.977
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO RESTORE

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.846
COURT OPERATIONS TO PREPEND THE

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:30.949
MAKE LEVELS AND WHAT ARE THE

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.219
MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF NEED. I

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:37.389
DON'T KNOW IF THE- MISTER YOUNG

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:38.724
YEAH SO THIS IS THE ROBERT A

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.826
YOUNG I AM I CAN ANSWER THAT IN

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:43.361
TERMS OF- RESTORATION- I THINK

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.563
THAT CHIEF JUSTICE REALLY

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.298
SUPPORTS PRIOR BUDGET CUT

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:49.634
RESTORATION- SHOULD THE STATE

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.870
REVENUES CONDITIONS IMPROVED-

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:56.108
IN TERMS OF. THE PRIORITIES THE

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:58.009
COURTS HAVE REALLY TAKEN AN

00:22:58.076 --> 00:23:00.912
INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC ACTIONS.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.280
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC THAT HAVE

00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:04.449
AFFECTED THEM LOCALLY SO IN

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:07.152
SOME CASES SOME COURTS HAVE HAD

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.354
TO REDUCE OUR STAFFING SOME

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.456
HAVE HAD TO HAVE- FURLOUGHS

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.126
OTHERS HAVE DELAYED-

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.861
INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:18.463
SERVICES AND SO THERE IS NOT

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.866
ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF PRIORITY

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:22.667
WHERE THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.703
IT'S REALLY DEPENDENTUPON EACH

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.438
INDIVIDUAL COURT IN TERMS OF

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:29.407
HOW THEY ADJUSTED AND PIVOTED.

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:31.409
TO ADDRESS THEIR LOCAL

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.645
CONSTRAINTS ARE IN THEIR COUNTY

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:35.147
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:38.550
COMBINATION OF OUR STAFFING AS

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:39.184
WELL AS ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.153
INVESTMENTS. HI NANCY I DON'T

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:42.654
KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:46.024
ADDITIONS YOU'D LIKE TO-

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.960
BATTERED WE'RE JUST TRYING TO.

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:50.262
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WOULD

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:52.297
AGREE WITH MR YOUNG OF MANY

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.265
COURTS HAVE TO REDUCE IN

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.500
DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON- IF

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.502
THEY HAD A TWO OR 3% RESERVE

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:59.738
AVAILABLE TO. KIND OF PRESENT A

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.807
GLIDE PATH- MANY COURTS HAVE TO

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:03.542
FURLOUGH OR LAYOFFS OR CREATE

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:05.143
THEY CAN SEIZE AND ALSO DIFFER

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.412
MANY PROJECTS- SO THAT WOULD BE

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.848
A PRIORITIZATION TO GET US BACK

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:11.750
TO PRE COATED. TIMES SO THERE

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:14.619
AREN'T ANY PARTICULAR UNIVERSAL-

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:19.157

FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.953
THIS. PREVENTS THE REDUCTION IN

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.721
SERVICE AND HELPS MAINTAIN ALL

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:26.623
OF THE EQUITY RELATED BENEFITS

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.592
THAT COMES FROM THESE RESOURCES

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.427
BUT THAT IS UNTIL THE

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:32.663
LEGISLATURE RECEIVES THE COST

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:36.834

AND THE INFORMATION WILL WOULD

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:42.673
BE HELPFUL. OUR LAST

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.208
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:46.243
LEGISLATURE MIGHT. EXCUSE ME

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.377

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:57.387
COULD CONSIDER SPECIFYING THAT

SUGGESTED I ABSOLUTELY THINK

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.571
THAT MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.072
GOING TO BE CONTINUING. I'M

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.440
PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHERE

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:32.309
THERE IS SOME REAL CHALLENGES

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.343
CONTESTANTS AND THESE ALL

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.078
STARTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.214
BUT- THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:38.548
WORK THAT THE SELF HLP CENTERS

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.050
OF DOWN HAVE REALLY PAID OFF IN

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:42.519
MANY WAYS. TO ENABLE US TO

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.721
PROVIDE NEARLY THE SAME LEVEL

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:46.923
OF SERVICES THAT WE- EVEN BEAT

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.694
THAT WE. WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.328
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I AT

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:53.363
EXAM IN FRESNO THE COURT HAS

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.865
PLACED COMPUTERS AT LEAST

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.333
STATIONS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.934
SHELTER AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.702
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.671
COUNTY. AND SO THAT ALLOWS THE

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.372
COURT BASED ATTORNEY NEEDS TO

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.573
HAVE VIDEO CONFERENCE MEETINGS

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.075
WITH LITIGANTS WHO HAVE COME TO

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:07.744
THE COURTHOUSE. AND ALLOWS THE

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.112
SELF HELP STAFF AND WOOD

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.881
AGAINST TO SEE THE SAME SCREEN.

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:14.584
SO THE SELF HELP CENTER CAN

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:15.118
HELP WITH AGAINST EMPLOYEE

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:18.188
PERFORMANCE. I'M OKAY WELL- I

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:21.658
APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER- I STILL

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:23.727
THINK THAT THERE'S A AN ISSUE

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.462
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO.

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:28.165
PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO- SOME

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:30.467
OF US HAVE BECOME SO. USED TO

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.069
HAVING THE TECHNOLOGY HAVING

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.770
THE DEVICES HAVING THE

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.772
CONNECTIVITY. THAT IT JUST

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:39.643
SEEMS SO SIMPLE- BUT IN REALITY

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.877
FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:42.746
SEEN THAT NOW WITH SCHOOLS

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:45.716
BEING CLOSED AND- ALL. WHO GETS

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:48.952
IMPACTED THE WORST BY THAT ARE-

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.788
POOR COMMUNITIES- COMMUNITIES

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.757
OF COLOR. THAT DON'T HAVE THAT

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.726
CONNECTIVITY EITHER THEY FOR

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.694
THE KIDS DON'T OR THE PARENTS

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.329
DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT SO.

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:01.031
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:02.232
THAT WE SHOULD JUST JUMP ON AND

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.801
SAY. GREAT TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT

00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:07.437
EASIER- AND IN SOME WAYS IS

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.740
GREAT UP BUT WE'RE STILL

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.942
LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND AND- WE

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.877
SHOULD BE VERY. COGNIZANT OF

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.781
THAT. AND PUT THAT INFORMATION

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:21.651
ON THE TABLE AS MUCH AS ALL THE

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:22.219
GREAT THINGS THAT COME FROM

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.254
TECHNOLOGY. ABSOLUTELY I

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:26.123
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:28.325
THINK MOVING FORWARD- THE IN

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:29.359
PERSON SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.395
CRITICAL AND HAVING THE STAFF

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.696
AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THAT IS

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.331
GOING TO BE CRITICAL. AS PART

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.233
OF A HYBRID YOU KNOW TRYING TO

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.768
TAKE THE BEST OF WHAT WE CAN

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:39.269
DO- FOR THOSE PEOPLE CAN USE

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.405
TECHNOLOGY. BUT ABSOLUTELY

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.340
BEING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE IN

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.609
PERSON SERVICES IS ALSO REALLY

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:52.716
ESSENTIAL. YEP AND THEN JUST-

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:55.385
ONE MORE QUESTION HERE- IT WHAT

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:56.887
KINDS OF CASES IF YOU HAVE A

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:58.655
BREAKDOWN FROM THESE SELF HELP

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.824
CENTERS. AS TO THE KINDS OF

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:07.030
CASES. THAT ARE HANDLED- AND-

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.432
AND THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.700
FUNDING WENT TO THE SELF HELP

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:11.268
SERVICES OVER THE LAST THREE

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:18.175
YEARS. ACT ABOUT THE ABOUT 78%

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.643
OF THE CASES INVOLVE FAMILY

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:23.447
LAW. DIVORCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:25.515
OUT OF CUSTODY AND SPORTAGE IS.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.785
OF 18% I WENT TO THE CIVIL LAW

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:32.923
OF CASES THIS IS HOW. THE BIRDS.

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:33.990
WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.826
THAT SIX WAS A BIG INCREASE IN

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.261
THE NUMBER OF CIVIL CASES SO OF

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:39.830
LANDLORD TENANT AND SMALL

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.565
CLAIMS TO SERVE OUR FRESHMAN.

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.967
OF MANY OF THESE CASE TYPES

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.303
EFFECT WE- THAT WORKS INCREASED

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:49.105
SERVICES. SIGNIFICANTLY AND

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:51.374
LANDLORD TENANT CASES. OF IN

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:54.744
FACT THAT NUMBER WOULD BE ABLE

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.379
TO ASSIST PRIOR TO THIS

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:57.981
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE HELP

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.916
CENTERS ASSISTED ABOUT 8% OF

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:01.918
THE CASES IN LANDLORD TENANT

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.154
MATTERS. PRESS THE BOARD AND

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:06.590
NOW OF A CENTERS ARE ASSISTING

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:10.293
IN 22% OF THE CASES THAT ARE

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.895
COMING BEFORE THE COURT AND

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:15.232
WHEN IT MATTERS. AGAIN I FANTA

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.033
THAT WILL INCREASE AGAIN WITH

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.471
THE YOUNG- AS THE MORATORIUM

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.406
WHAT AND THEN PROBATE WHICH IS

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:26.076
PRIMARILY- GUARDIANSHIP OF FIVE

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:29.145
CHILDREN THAT THE CARE OF AND A

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.014
CONSERVATORSHIP IS ABOUT 4% OF

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.116
THE SERVICES. AND IN TERMS OF

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:35.418
HOW THE FUNDING WHICH USED OF

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:36.887
THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING

95% OF FUNDING IS USED FOR

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:41.124
STAFF AND SO THE NUMBER OF

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.093
STAFF THAT WERE ARE ABLE TO

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:44.227

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:50.700
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX A QUICK WENT

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.102
FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STAFF OF

00:52:52.168 --> 00:52:54.271
ATTORNEYS AND- NON ATTORNEY

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:59.876
PROFESSIONALS. AND 46% OF THOSE

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:03.079
NEW STAFF MEMBERS ARE BILINGUAL.

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:11.821
OKAY- THIRTY. AND THE SPEND-

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:13.657
THERE'S NINETEEN MILLION THAT

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:15.559
WILL BE GOING TO THE SELF HELP

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:20.463
CENTERS- DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.198
TO HOW THOSE- THE DELIVERY

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.700
METHOD IT'S GOING TO BE USES IT

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.903
PERSON IN PERSON VIRTUAL.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:31.141
HYBRID OF IN PERSON NUMBER JOEL.

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.576
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:35.445
EVOLVING- JUST AS WE HAVE

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.147
CONTINUED TO EVOLVE I THINK AS

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.416
YOU POINTED OUT OF WE'RE GOING

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:40.383
TO HAVE TO HAVE IN PERSON

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.685
SERVICES THEY'RE JUST GOING TO

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:44.788
BE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED THAT-

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:47.190
BOTH BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.326
THESE ARE LIFE CHANGING EVENTS

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.794
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT THEY'RE

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.062
COMING TO WORK TO DEAL WITH THE

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.897
COMING FOR OBJECTION ARE COMING

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:54.397
FOR THE MASSIVE VIOLENCE

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.967
THEY'RE COMING FOR OTHER

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:59.102
THINGS. AND- FOR SOME FOLKS

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.870
THAT'S OKAY IN TECHNOLOGY OTHER

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.672
PEOPLE REALLY REALLY NEED MUCH

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:05.508
MORE ON PERSONAL SERVICE. AND

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.877
SO I THINK THAT AS I SAY I

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:09.045
THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.847
CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THE COURTS

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.983
HAVE MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES. IN

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.818
TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE BEST

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:17.120
WAYS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:17.687
ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE DURING

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.389
THIS PERIOD. AND I DON'T THINK

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:22.125
WE KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER YET-

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:23.893
THE DATA THAT WE HAD FOR THE

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.463
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS FROM

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:27.731
TWENTY NINETEEN AND- EVERYTHING

00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:31.768
CHANGED IN TERMS OF. OF HOW

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.803
PEOPLE ARE USING ASSISTANCE-

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.804
WHAT STATE AT ALL THOSE KINDS

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.340
OF THINGS SO- WE'RECONTINUING

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.509
TO EVOLVE AND GROW AND REALLY.

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.878
ENCOURAGE COURTS TO BE AS

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.480
INNOVATIVE AS POSSIBLE TO

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.148
PROVIDE THE BEST ASSISTANCE

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:46.182
POSSIBLE TO THE MOST AMOUNT OF

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:48.284
PEOPLE. AND WE NEED EVERY WEEK

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.086

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.357
SUPPORT SHARE THEIR BEST

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.660
PRACTICES AND IDEAS- AND I

00:54:56.726 --> 00:54:58.662
THINK WE'LL JUST REALLY NEED TO

00:54:58.728 --> 00:54:59.763
CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THAT OF

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.831
ALL. I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:03.199

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:08.738
ANSWERS YET. OKAY THANK YOU.

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:19.115
NAIVE OR UNINFORMED SO. ON OKAY.

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:20.984
QUESTION ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.719
ANALYSIS OF THE L. A. O.'S

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:25.021
COMMENTS INDICATE THAT THE COST

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:25.655
BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:29.459
INCOMPLETE- AS REQUIRED BY THE

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:30.093
TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.961
BUDGET- BUT THAT THE JUDICIAL

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:34.097
BRANCH SUBMITTED A REPORT IN

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.433
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TO COMPLY

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.301
BUT WHICH THE L. A- WOULD

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:40.570
ASSERT DID NOT SO WE WOULD- DID

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:43.206
DID FRANK IT'S A COURSE FOR THE

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.407
JUDICIAL BRANCH FIRST- WOULD

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:47.377
YOU. DISAGREE WITH THE L. A.

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.512
O.'S CHARACTERIZATION. OF

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.414
HAVING FAILED TO DO THE COST

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:58.054
BENEFIT ANALYSIS. I THINK THAT

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.222
WE ABSOLUTELY DID THE COST

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:00.657
BENEFIT ANALYSIS I THINK THAT

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.425
THEY ARE- AS THEY SAY THAT

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.294
THERE WERE THINGS THAT WE HAD

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.528
HOPED TO COLLECT APPROACH YOU

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.496
HAVE A PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:07.630
INFORMATION THAT WE SIMPLY

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.332
COULDN'T DO AS A RESULT OF THE

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:11.634
PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK THAT THE-

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.436
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT WE

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.605
SUBMITTED IT PROVIDES EXTENSIVE

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:18.007
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SORT OF

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.909
THE MIX OF DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.711
WHERE WORKSHOPS CAN BE HELPFUL

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:24.481
WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES-

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:27.250
AND- HOW WHEN I WENT TO WORK-

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:29.085
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.054
HAS PROVIDED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:33.823
DATA. AND IT ALSO- ADDRESSED

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.692
MANY OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:38.428
JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND STAFF TO

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:41.531
TALK ABOUT HOW FILINGS ARE NOT

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.767
REJECTED- WHEN THEIR STUFF OF

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:46.035
STAFF- PERFORMS ARE ACTUALLY

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:47.537
LEGIBLE AND THEIR COMPLETE AND

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.405
HOW MUCH TIME THAT SAVES THAT

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:50.907
PARTIES UNDERSTAND THEIR CASES

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.442
BETTER THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:53.743
COME TO COURT WERE PREPARED.

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.578
AND THAT JUDGES AND COURT STAFF

00:56:55.645 --> 00:57:02.552
AND ARE BETTER REVIEW DOCUMENTS.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.320
IN IN MUCH LESS TIME. ALSO DOWN.

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:05.655
THE INCREASED MEDIA. FOR SELF

00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:07.757
HELP US. TALK ABOUT THAT. JUST

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:11.327
OVER. SERVICES BEING PROVIDED-

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:13.830
AND- HOW MUCH MORE IS NEEDED

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.131
AND WE DID A- CUSTOMER

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:17.300
SATISFACTION. SURVEY IS PART OF

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.802
THAT RECEIVE NEARLY SEVEN

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:22.105
THOUSAND- RESPONSES AND WHILE

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.640
PEOPLE WERE THRILLED WITH THE

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.308
SERVICE LISTEN NUMBER NINETY

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:27.577
SIX PERCENT- WERE. EXTREMELY

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:30.146
SATISFIED OR VERY SATISFIED

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:33.416
AND- BUT THEY'RE THE KINDS OF

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.717
THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT WHEN

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:35.985
WE ASKED YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:36.953
ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.855
IMPROVEMENTS AND THEY TALKED

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.790
ABOUT WE NEED MORE STAFF-

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.392
REDUCE WAIT TIMES AND LINES

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.027
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE KNOW

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.929
THAT THERE IS. A VERY STRONGLY.

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:48.464
AND AGAIN I THINK THE KINDS OF

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.966
IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.402
STRATEGY THAT I USE I. AM SURE

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.137
THAT THE L. A. O. WITH- YOU

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.105
KNOW WE ALL WANT TO PROVIDE THE

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.907
SERVICES AS EFFECTIVELY AS

00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:01.811
POSSIBLE. AGAIN I THINK THAT IN

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:04.647
TIME OF ENORMOUS. AND

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.783
DEVELOPMENT AND OF THOSE KINDS

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.219
OF THINGS BECOME EXT REALLY

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:12.322
DIFFICULT TO TELL AND- BOTH YOU

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:14.924
KNOW EVERYONE'S. ACCEPTANCE AND

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.259
ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY IS

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.095
CHANGING SO- I THINK THAT WE

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.497
NEED- THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:25.768
UP YOU KNOW WE TOOK VERY- VERY-

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.403
PROVIDE A LOT OF INFORMATION

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.771
THAT WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL FOR

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:32.609
US IN TERMS. OF MAKING

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:33.209
DECISIONS AND MOVING FORWARD.

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.544
CHAU AYE I THOUGHT SILVA GROW

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.613
REST THAT IS VERY GOOD QUESTION

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:39.549
ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD- YOU KNOW

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:40.516
HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:41.985
BETWEEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.152
KIND OF EXISTING PROCESSES

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:45.788
PRIOR TO- THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:48.391
THESE NEW THINGS. SO HOW SHOULD

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.927
WE USE THE LEGISLATURE RESPOND.

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:51.327
TO THE L. A. U. S.

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:54.597
RECOMMENDATION. TO INSIST UPON

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.799
AND IT YOU KNOW AND- DATE COST

00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:00.169
BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND TO USE AN

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:02.772
EXTERNAL PARTY TO DO THAT. IS

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.241
IT IT IS IT IN YOUR VIEW

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:07.777
NECESSARY WOULD IT BE USEFUL.

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:11.180
IS IT UNNECESSARY IF SO. HOW DO

00:59:11.247 --> 00:59:13.816
WE MAKE THE CORRECT ALLOCATIONS

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:16.152
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RIGHT MIX OF

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.288
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SELF HELP

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:22.859
WITH THE OLD PROSTITUTE. WELL I

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.761
WOULD SAY WE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:26.729
HAVING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:29.198
THAT WE WILL BE- WITH WITH AND

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:31.000
NOT OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL DATA

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.435
COLLECTION SYSTEMS WILL

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.871
ABSOLUTELY BE WATCHING TO SEE

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:36.139
HOW PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.507
SERVICES HOW MANY SERVICES ARE

00:59:37.573 --> 00:59:39.809
ABLE TO PROVIDE HOW THAT VARIES

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:40.643
BY COUNTY OF THE SORTS OF

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.845
THINGS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.781
GOING TO BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:48.084
TO- HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS- YOU

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:51.354

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:55.191
THINGS THAT SELF HELP I WAS

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.526
ABLE TO DO WITH THE INCREASE IN

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:57.827
FUNDING. WESTRICK SPAN

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:00.029
SILVERMAN'S OR MRS- WHICH WAS

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.432
AS WE DID EARLIER I THINK A

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.634
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.269
WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE AND

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.804
DEAL WITH THIS BACKLOG AND

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.974
THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES. AND

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.311
THOSE- YOU THINK IT BECOMES YOU

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.612
KNOW. DEPENDS ON K. TYPE IT UP

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:19.716
ON MANY FACTORS. IN TERMS OF AN

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.051
ALLOCATION OF THOSE RESOURCES-

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.386
AND THOSE ARE GOING TO CHANGE

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.888
OVER TIME. AND OTHER KINDS OF

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.024
THINGS SO I DON'T I WILL SAY AS

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.093
A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. I

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.662
DON'T THINK THAT THE-

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.999
ADDITIONAL- TYPE OF ANALYSIS-

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:36.933
THAT IS BEING SUGGESTED BY THE

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.534
L. A. R. WILL BE ENORMOUSLY

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.436
HELPFUL I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.505

HERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:13.503
BECAUSE OF BUDGET LIMITATIONS.

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:14.370
YOU HAD TO LIMIT THE HOURS.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.105
BODY FOR CORPORATE- IN THE

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.175

BILLING WHOLE TRIALS. SO WHAT

LOOKING FORWARD. WHAT IS THE

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.217
THINKING WITH RESPECT THE

IN LIEU OF ADDITIONAL- OF THE-

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.660
FUNDING FOR TRADITIONAL COURT

REPORTERS FOR IS IT IN IT AS A

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:46.335
COMPLIMENT TO THAT. I AM NOT

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:47.937
PREPARED TO ADDRESS THIS FOR I

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.138
DON'T I DON'T MEAN TO SURPRISE

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:50.907
YOU BUT THE APPRECIATE YOUR

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:51.374
ANSWERS TO THE EARLIER

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.276
QUESTIONS. I MEAN FOR SOMEONE

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:56.679
ELSE MISTER MISTER- YOUNG MIGHT

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.347
BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT CAN

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.715
SOMEONE ELSE THIS IS JUDGE

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.851
HINRICHS I JUST WANTED TO JUMP

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:02.785
IN ON THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:06.656
THE I NEED FOR EVALUATION

01:02:06.722 --> 01:02:08.424
CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE-

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.559
SHOULD DO ANY. QUESTION THAT

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:10.827
THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.962
THEIR ALLOCATIONS OF MONIES BUT

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.630
I REALLY DO THINK THAT AT THIS

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:15.364
POINT IN TIME IT WOULD BE

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:18.534
HELPFUL. TO ALLOW THE BRANCH

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.602
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.637
SERVICES AT SELF HELP TO TAKE A

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.706
BREATH TO RESET TO RATE RIGHT

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.541
SIZE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.743
THEN TO COME TOGETHER AND TALK

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.511
ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT JOINTLY

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.580
NEED TO. BETTER PROVIDE

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.115
SERVICES AND BETTER DEMONSTRATE

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.216
TO THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE'RE

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.184
DOING AND HOW IT'S JUSTIFIED-

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.986
IT'S JUST A VERY CHALLENGING

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.888
TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.656
TO THE FOR THE BRANCH BECAUSE-

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.725
WE'RE LOOKING AT. HOW TO

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.193
TRANSITION THROUGH AND TO GIVE

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.295
ANY SORT OF WHAT WHAT TO LOOK

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.264
AT NOW IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.699
OF HOW WILL BE CHANGED BY THE

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:52.068
PANDEMIC ITSELF. AND WELL I

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.136
THINK THE COURT REPORTER

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.972
QUESTION MAYBE MORE COMPLEX- IN

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:56.739
A LOT OF COUNTIES IT'S NOT A

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.474
QUESTION OF. NOT HAVING

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.076
RESOURCES FOR POOR PORTER SO

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.144
THAT MAYBE SOMEONE OF AN ISSUE

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.979
IS REALLY HAVING ENOUGH FOR

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:06.115
PORTERS- TO. DO THE JOB WITH IN

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.451
OUR COURTS JUST THIS LAST WEEK.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.685
WE COULDN'T PROCEED WITH

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.320
PULMONARY HEARINGS BECAUSE

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.188
THERE WERE NO COURT REPORTERS

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:15.258
AVAILABLE TO. COME TO COURT TO

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.160
DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.494
BECAUSE OF QUARANTINES AND

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.029
OTHER ISSUES SO I THINK THE

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.764
COURT PORTER ISSUE IS VERY VERY

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:25.368
COMPLEX AND- WOULD. INVITE A

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:28.137
DEEPER CONVERSATION BUT- BUT IT

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.740
IS- CHALLENGING- IN MATTERS AND

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:31.874
I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.409
THAT CAN BE DONE BUT I THINK

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.944
THAT'S A LONGER CONVERSATION IN

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:37.680
INTO. OTHER IN OTHER WAYS

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.315
YOU'RE A BREACH OF ITS OF MY

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.149
UNDERSTANDING SAID THERE'S

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.818
BEEN. YOU KNOW A- OF DEFERENCE

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:45.054
GIVEN TO THE G. DISCONTINUED

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.088
JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO THE

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.890
JUDICIAL BRANCH EARLIER- IN HOW

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.625
YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING ONCE IT'S

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.228
PROVIDED. BUT CLEARLY TO YOUR

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.730
POINT THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:56.832
COURT REPORTER RESOURCES. HAS

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.601
BEEN A LOOMING FACTOR ON THE

01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:59.135
ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.204
FUNCTION WELL SO. I THINK THAT

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.271
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.040
HAPPY TO GET DEEPLY INVOLVED IN

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:05.675
THAT BUT I'M I'M NOT SURE. WHEN

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:10.980
YOU. THINK ABOUT- DIVISIONS.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:11.847
OTHER OF THE SEPARATION POWER

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.516
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING. YOU FOR.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.117
ARE NO. GOING TO WELCOME I WANT

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.286
TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.388
QUESTION- ABOUT THE COST

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.756
BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE ALEJO'S

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.159
RECOMMENDATION. IS THAT WE

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:26.896
REQUIRE ONE AND THAT. THIS COST

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:29.532
WOULD BE ABSORBED. BY THE FUNDS

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.900
PROVIDED SO IT WOULD COME AT

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.768
THE EXPENSE OF THE ALLOCATION

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:34.503
WE'RE GIVING YOU AND SO YOU

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.671
KNOW LOVE FOR YOU TO RESPOND

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:38.074
BECAUSE- THAT SEEMS REASONABLE-

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.643
IF YOU IF YOU BUY INTO THE- THE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.545
NEED FOR IT- BUT IF YOU DON'T

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.647
BUY INTO THAT NEED I DIED BUT I

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:45.348
WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU DON'T

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:49.352
WANT TO. LOSE THOSE FUNDS TO

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.020
THAT BECAUSE- YEAH SO THIS IS

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.421
ROBERT A YOUNG FROM THE

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.423
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I CAN-

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.958
ADDRESS THAT AT THIS POINT WE

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:58.194
FEEL THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:01.564
USE OF THOSE FUNDS- TWO HUNDRED

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.164
THOUSAND DOLLARS BASICALLY IT

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.201
REPRESENTS- AN ADDITIONAL STAFF

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:07.069
FOR NATIONAL ATTORNEY. WHO

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:09.171
COULD BE AT A SELF HELP CENTER

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.307
HELPING A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.242
AND ALTHOUGH I DO ACKNOWLEDGE-

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.411
MS LEE'S COMMENTS IN TERMS OF-

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.647
THE DESIRE TO HAVE MORE DETAIL

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:19.615
IN THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:22.918
THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS- AS-

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.687
NEWS HEALTH MENTIONED IS

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.656
COMPLETE AND IT DOES INDICATE

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:30.259
STILL A HIGH NEED FOR MORE

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.795
STAFF. FROM THE PUBLIC MORE

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.897
STAFF MORE STAFF WHO CAN SPEAK.

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:38.834
LANGUAGES AND SO AT THIS POINT

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:41.570
WE FEEL THAT THE- INVESTMENT

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:44.173
SHOULD GO DIRECTLY TO HELPING

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.875
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AT

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.943
SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE MAY

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.680
WISH TO CONDUCT. A ADDITIONAL

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.548
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS TO HELP

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.751
US IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS FOR

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.687
INVESTMENT BUT AGAIN AS

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.689
MISSILES HAD MENTIONED- THE

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.590
BIGGEST DEMAND RIGHT NOW IS IN

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:04.360
FAMILY LAW. WE HAVE MADE.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.162
TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN EXPANDING

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:09.332
INTO A CIVIL AS WELL AND THE

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.733
DATA THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.501
COLLECT POINTS AS TO THOSE

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.603
AREAS OF GREATEST NEED. BY THE

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.105
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:18.207
FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT WE ARE

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:20.943
NOT AT A POINT WHERE- WE CAN

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.179
EVEN SATISFY THE BASIC NEEDS OF

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:25.014
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.382
WE FEEL THAT THOSE FUNDS SHOULD

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.018
GO DIRECTLY THEIR FIRST. AND AT

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:33.689
SOME POINT LATER. WE CAN LOOK

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.124
AT THE- ACERBIC AREA. AND THEN

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.326
TO A THE OTHER QUESTION IN

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:38.494
TERMS OF ALLOCATION OF THIS IS

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.029
RELATED SOMEWHAT TO COURT

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.598
REPORTERS- BUT IN TERMS OF OUR

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.799
STRATEGY AND I HAD MENTIONED

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.001
THIS EARLIER- RELATED TO REMOTE

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.871
HEARINGS. OUR STRATEGY IS NOT

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:52.308
A- STATE OR BE SERVICE

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:54.443
OFFERING. OUR STRATEGY IS

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.346
REALLY AND SERVICE OFFERING SO

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.748
WE FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:01.050
OFFERING. PHYSICAL FACE TO FACE

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.552
SERVICES AND REMOTE SERVICES

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:04.920
BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS THE

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.956
JUDICIAL BRANCH TO ADDRESS THE

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:10.059
NEEDS OF THE WIDEST- POPULATION

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.227
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO WANT TO

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.661
ACCESS SERVICES REMOTELY AS

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.497
WELL AS THOSE. FACE TO FACE SO

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.699
OUR STRATEGY FROM A JUDICIAL

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.167
BRANCH PERSPECTIVE AND THE AND

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:21.003
THE CHIEFS IN TERMS OF- ACCESS

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.172
THREE D. IS REALLY PHYSICAL AND

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.508
VIRTUAL BOTH IN SIMULTANEOUS.

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:26.709
SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:29.812
MAXIMUM ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IF

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:30.679

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.378
LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:03.712
CONTACTS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.948
AND IN CASE THAT'S HELPFUL FOR

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:08.083
THE SENATORS- SO WHAT KIND OF A

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.586
COUPLE ITEMS- FIRST IN TERMS OF

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:13.022
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:13.622
NINETEEN LANGUAGE WHEN THIS

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.758
REPORT WAS FIRST REQUIRED IT

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.259
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:19.395
JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN CONDUCT IT

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.429
OR THEY CAN CONTACT WITH THE

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.931
RESEARCHER AND IT SPECIFICALLY

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:24.200
SAYS IT IS A COST BENEFIT

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:26.302
ANALYSIS THERE WAS NO ROOM SORT

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:29.905
OF FOR INTERPRETATION- AND SO.

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:31.574
THAT THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.708
WOULD SORT OF EMPHASIZE IS

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:36.679
THAT- THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS-

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.214
HAS CONDUCTED A COST BENEFIT

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.583
ANALYSIS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.284
AREA RELATED TO SELF HELP AT

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:43.185
LEAST ACCORDING TO OUR

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.887
KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS A COST

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.355
BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE DEAL

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:49.191
HAVE- KIND OF AN IDEA OF WHAT A

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.993
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WHAT

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.761
WOULD LOOK LIKE AND CONSIST OF

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.063
WHICH I THINK IS A SOMETHING

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.498
THAT STANDS OUT FOR US WHAT YOU

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.565
HAVE IN THE REPORT WHEN YOU'LL

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:59.168
GET IT BEFORE YOU. IS SOMETHING

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.903
THAT WE RECOGNIZE INCLUDES A

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.339
LOT OF VERY HELPFUL OUTCOME

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:05.641
DATA AND IT STARTS DOWN THE

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.343
PATH OF IDENTIFYING THE

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:08.711
BENEFITS AND SO WHEN WE TALK

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:11.046
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS FOR

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:12.648
COMPLETING IT WE DON'T THINK

01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:14.650
IT'LL LIKELY EXCEED A COUPLE

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:15.150
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:16.118
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THE

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.786
EXTERNAL RESEARCHER WILL BE

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:20.890
ABLE TO USE- SOME OF THAT

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:21.824
INFORMATION A LOT OF THE

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:23.225
INFORMATION THAT WAS COLLECTED

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:24.326
THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.961
IT BUT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO USE A

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.429
LARGE PORTION OF IT SINCE THEN

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.698
THE FINISH OFF. A COST BENEFIT

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.333
ANALYSIS KIND OF GOING BACK TO

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.935
MY COMMENTS YOU DON'T HAVE YOU

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.169
KNOW A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.704
LOOKS AT BENEFITS INSIDE THE

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.139
MONETARY VALUE AND IDENTIFY THE

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.607
COST YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:39.942
RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT IN THE

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.211
PIECE THAT YOU HAVE. AND THE

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:43.812
CONCEPT FOR ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.347
REASONS WHY YOU WHY COST

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.449
BENEFIT ANALYSIS BE HOPEFUL IS

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.685
THAT CAN REALLY HOLE- DETERMINE

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.387
HOW WE MAXIMIZE USE OF THE

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.022
DOLLARS AND SO ONE OF THE

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:54.757
THINGS THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:09:54.823 --> 01:10:00.229
IS THIS NEED FOR SELF HELP.

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:00.796
DOLLARS WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:01.363
DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT IT'S

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.298
ISSUE ABOUT CAN WE- A TARGET IN

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:03.132
USE THAT. SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDE

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.401
AS MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:07.269
SERVICES AS POSSIBLE SO TO GIVE

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.338
YOU AN EXAMPLE. COST BENEFIT

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.040
ANALYSIS MIGHT DETERMINE THAT

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:12.808
WORKSHOPS ARE ONLY REALLY

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.043
EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN CASE

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:15.744
TYPES. SUCH AS LIKE YOU KNOW

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:16.612
YOU'RE STARTING DIVORCES OR

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.013
THINGS LIKE THAT FULL ONE ON

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.915
ONE SERVICES ARE REALLY. KIND

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.184
OF THE MOST- COST BENEFICIAL

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:23.218
AND GUARDIANSHIP OR PROBATE

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.955
CASES. AND SO THAT'S HOW THAT

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.356
INFORMATION WOULD BE USED TO

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.124
INFORM DECISIONS TO MAXIMIZE

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.626
THE DOLLARS. IT'S AWFULLY

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:31.493
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.596
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT SECOND THAT

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.229

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET THAT

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.451

TO CONDUCT THE COST BENEFIT

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:01.824
ANALYSIS. AND I ASSUMED IT WAS

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.492

SPECIFICALLY IN THE- OF ONLINE

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.492
AND- THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:58.893
HELPFUL FOR USERS THEM TO

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.662

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:18.379
MISLI. IS A MYSTERY OR YEAH.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:20.915
YES I NEARLY WITH THE L. A. L.

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:24.018
SO WE HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.987
ON THIS ISSUE ITEM BEFORE YOU

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.889
SO FIRST WE ARE RECOMMENDING

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.390
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.525
THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.160
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CANCEL THE

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:34.095
PILOT CANCEL THE REQUIRED

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:35.964
EVALUATION AND EXPAND THE POOL

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:38.967
ONLINE- THIS IS. THIS IS

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:40.301
BECAUSE IN A CERTAIN COMPONENTS

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:41.769
OF THE TOOL ARE STILL IN THE

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:43.137
PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED AND

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.539
IMPLEMENTED SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.875
ONLINE TRIALS ARE NOT SLATED TO

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:49.811
ACTUALLY COME ONLINE UNTIL- YOU

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.579
KNOW A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:52.947
AND SO IT COULD MEAN THAT THE

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:54.916
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT ARE

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.719
DIFFERENT- IN ADDITION IN TERMS

01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:59.521
OF THE EVALUATION WE WOULD KNOW

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.723
THAT. WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:02.891
EXISTING LANGUAGE IN THE

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.826
EVALUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.094
THE REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT IS

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.362
CURRENTLY ON IN THE TRAILER

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.197
BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU AND

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.699
SO- MORE COMPLETE DATA FROM THE

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.301
EVALUATION OF THE COMPLETED

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:15.503
HIGH LET IS NECESSARY BECAUSE

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.006
IT CAN HELP INFORM- THE

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.674
LEGISLATURE ON THE FULL IMPACT

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:20.508
OF ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.043
WERE BEING TESTED WHICH COULD

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.511
THEN BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.812
LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS SO FOR

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:26.648
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:27.815
WANT TO CONSIDER HIGHER

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:30.084
REDUCTIONS FOR INCOME- FOR

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.019
THOSE WHO FALL WITHIN THE

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.587
DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME. OR

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:33.855
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:34.923
PROVIDING AN AUTOMATIC

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:36.925
PRODUCTION FOR ADDITIONAL

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:38.793
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS SUCH

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.128
AS PEOPLE WHO DON'T CURRENTLY

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:42.230
FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.264
LOW INCOME SO THESE ARE AND

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:45.767
THAT'S WHAT IS THAT COULD HAVE-

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:46.968
DECISIONS THAT COULD BE

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:50.872
INFORMED. BY THE EVALUATION.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:54.142
UPSET WE DO. THAT THE ABILITY

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:55.343
TO PAY COMPONENT OF THE KIND

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.744
THAT DEFINITELY PROVIDES

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:57.912
MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO LOWER

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.113
INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.015
PROMOTES. EQUITY AND SO TO

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.817
FURTHER THAT WE WOULD-

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.686
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.821
THOUGH ONLY IMPROVE THE TWELVE

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.156
POINT THREE MILLION REQUESTED

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:10.224
IN THE BUDGET. SO THAT WOULD

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:11.626
ROLL OUT TO ADDITIONAL TEN

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.628
COURTS AS ENVISIONED BY THE

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:14.629
JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT WOULD

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.130
PROVIDE MORE PEOPLE WITH

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:19.167
FINANCIAL RELIEF FROM PROMOTE.

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.668
EIGHT BUT IT WOULD PREVENT THE

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.203
PROGRAM FROM AUTOMATICALLY

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.372
CONTINUING BEYOND THE BUDGET

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.274
YEAR BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:27.208
AN OPPORTUNITY A CLEAR

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:29.043
OPPORTUNITY OF CLEAR BREAK TO

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:31.446
DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES IF ANY

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.848
THAT IT WANTS TO MAKE- FROM

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:36.084
BASED OFF OF THE INFORMATION

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:38.152
THAT I GOT FROM THE EVALUATION-

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.621
OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.189
THAT THERE IS PROPOSED-

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.290
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:44.192
AUTHORIZE FINANCE TO ALLOCATE

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.260
THE BACK FULL REVENUES. AMONGST

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:47.395
THE VARIOUS JUDICIAL BRANCH

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.063
FUNDS WE THINK THAT THAT MAKES

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.231
SENSE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.366
TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO MAKE

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:54.369
SURE THAT THE AMOUNT PROVIDED

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.938
IS COMMENSURATE WITH A LOT- AND

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.040
OUR FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.408
THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.176
PROPOSES TO AUTHORIZE TRIAL

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.811
COURTS TO CONDUCT ALL

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.546
INFRACTION PROCEEDINGS REMOTELY

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.749
UPON CONSENT OF THE DEFENDANT

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:09.751
WHICH WOULD BE BEYOND TO THE

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:12.820
OFFICES OF THIS ONLINE TOOL- WE

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:14.155
DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT CAN

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.723
PROMOTE EQUITY AND INCREASE

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.525
PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE COURTS.

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.726
AND THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.628
APPROVE IT WE DO RECOMMEND

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:21.629
THOUGH THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.231
DIRECT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:25.199
SUBMIT AN EVALUATION OR REPORT

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.734
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.036
LANGUAGE AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.303
THERE'S CURRENTLY QUITE A BIT

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.172
OF UNKNOWNS. FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.674
ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.008
KNOW WHICH COURTS HOW MANY

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.043
QUARTS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.944
THIS AUTHORIZATION AND EXACTLY

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.013
HOW THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.548
IN LINE WITH THAT THERE'S ALSO

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.784
NOT QUITE CLEAR IMPACT ON WHAT

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.719
THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON CORE

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.587
OPERATIONS ARE COSTS SO FOR

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:49.157
EXAMPLE- REMOTE PROCEEDINGS MAY

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:51.292
BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.527
INDIVIDUALS AND SO YOU MIGHT

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:53.961
HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:56.898
CONTEST. AND FRACTIONS- MORE SO

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:57.532
THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:58.633
DONE THEY WOULD NORMALLY JUST

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.234
PAID OFF AND SO THAT COULD LEAD

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:01.969
TO INCREASED WORKLOAD. ON THE

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.771
FLIP SIDE THIS COULD BE A MORE

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:05.640
EFFICIENT WAY OF DEALING WITH

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.008
THESE CASES BUT BECAUSE WE

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.309
DON'T KNOW I'M THAT WHAT THE

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.178
IMPACT WOULD BE REPORTING WOULD

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:12.246
BE REALLY HELPFUL- TO INFORM

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.448
FUTURE LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:14.749
SUCH AS WHETHER OR NOT REMOTE

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:18.920
PROCEEDING SHOULD BE EXPANDED.

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:19.587
TO OTHER CASE TYPES FOR EXAMPLE.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:24.926
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FROM. IS

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.894
THE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR OF

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:29.130
FINANCE MISTER ROMIJN YOU

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.966
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT- THE

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:34.135
PHASED ROLLOUT THAT YOU'D BE

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.003
OPEN DID I HEAR YOU'RE RIGHT WE

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:38.306
SAID DID YOU BE OPEN TO THAT IS

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:40.441

GREAT AS ENOUGH IN THE BANK TO

ONGOING INSOLVENCY. OF THESE

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.480
FUNDS AND SO WE WOULD BE

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:02.349
DEFINITELY LOOKING TOWARDS-

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:04.985
GENERAL FUND. AS THE SOLUTION

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:07.621
FOR THAT AGAIN THAT IS- TO WORK

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:08.989
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LET'S

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:12.159

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:16.029
PROVIDE- COULD COST OF REVENUES

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.098
TO COVER. THAT SERVICE WHICH IS

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.400
VERY CRITICAL EXPENSE OF OURS-

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:22.035
FACILITY MODIFICATIONS ARE

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:23.570
COURTHOUSES ENSURE THAT THEY

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:26.273
ARE FUNCTIONING- APPROPRIATELY

STORIES IN CONSTRUCTION

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:34.147
PROGRAM. SO THOSE ARE CRITICAL

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:36.850
EXPENSES ON THAT THESE FUNDS

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:38.351
ARE COVERING AND DUE TO LACK OF

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:40.587
THE ONGOING REVENUES WE DO NEED

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:42.956
ON AN ONGOING SOLUTION AND THAT

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:46.026
SOLUTION AT THIS JUNCTURE

01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:46.693
DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A GENERAL.

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.230
AND THE QUESTIONS- IN FREEDOM

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:53.133

KNOW MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:03.977
JUST LIKE TO ASK THAT THE

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:05.312
INDIAN CURRY BELIEVES ACCOUNT

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:06.947
IS A SUB ACCOUNT OF THE STATE

01:48:07.013 --> 01:48:09.349
FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND BY

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.451
CONSOLIDATING THESE FUNDS THIS

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:13.253
ALLOWS FOR THE STATE STATE

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.988
COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:16.423
REMAIN SOLVENT IN THE BUDGET

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.792
YEAR WITH ALPHA EIGHT GENERAL

THE FUND TO MAINTAIN EXISTING

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:23.797
SERVICE LEVELS FOR THE JUDICIAL

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:25.599
COUNCIL'S FACILITIES PROGRAM AS

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.767
WELL AS MENTIONED- IN A DAY IN

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.002
ADDITION CONSOLIDATION PERMITS

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:30.704
BUDGETARY. EFFICIENCIES WITHIN

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.472
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THROUGH THE

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:34.774
REDUCTION OF SPECIAL FUNDS

01:48:34.841 --> 01:48:35.909
SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SPECIAL

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:38.411
FUNDS SB ADMINISTERED BY THE

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:40.046
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS WELL AS

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:41.815
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STAFF

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.216
IT'S LESS ADMINISTRATIVE WORK

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:44.918
FOR THEM TO COMPLETE. IN

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:46.019
REGARDS TO THE L. A. S.

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:50.257
RECOMMENDATION ON A IN COMBINED

01:48:50.323 --> 01:48:52.292
MOVING RESPONSE TO THE GENERAL

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.861
FUND I'M HERE SAYING- ANYWAY

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:55.996
WE'RE ESSENTIALLY MAKING FOR

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:58.431
FACILITY MAINTENANCE WE WOULD

01:48:58.498 --> 01:48:59.933
LOOK AT ME REVENUE FROM CORE

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.968
ASSEMBLY MAINTENANCE AND THIS

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:02.736
WOULD COMPETE WITH OTHER

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:05.605
FUNDING FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:07.240
INSIDE THE GENERAL FUND FOR

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.542
EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE. WELL

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.278
IN THE FUTURE THE SOLUTION

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:12.979
WOULD BE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:15.282
THE FUTURE- TO KEEP THE FUND'S

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:18.351
SOLVENCY THIS. IS WINDY AS

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:27.160
SIGNIFICANT AS MOVING. THE

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:27.794
PROGRAM ENTIRELY TO THE GENERAL

01:49:27.861 --> 01:49:29.329
FUND. OKAY THANK YOU- L. A.

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:33.667
PLEASE. ANY DALY WITH THE L. A.

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:36.069
L. SO WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:37.804
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOTH

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:40.974
ISSUES FIVE AND SIX AND GATHER

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.910
BECAUSE- ISSUE FIVE PERTAINS TO

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:45.278
KIND OF EXISTING OBLIGATIONS

01:49:45.345 --> 01:49:46.346
SUPPORTED BY THE ACCOUNTS AND

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:48.915
THEN YOUR ISSUE SIX- WHICH IS

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.283
FOR ADDITIONAL NEW TRAVEL

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.385
CONSTRUCTION OBLIGATIONS ARE

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:54.387
FOCUSING ON THE FUTURE AND SO

01:49:54.454 --> 01:49:55.455
AS A LEGISLATURE IS

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.691
CONSIDERING. AFFECTED WE

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:58.558
RESTARTING CHILDHOOD

01:49:58.625 --> 01:49:59.526
CONSTRUCTION WE THOUGHT IT

01:49:59.592 --> 01:50:00.293
COULD BE HELPFUL TO KIND OF

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.828
PACKAGE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:04.631
TOGETHER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:05.231
THEY KIND OF INTERTWINED WITH

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.467
ONE ANOTHER. SO AT MINIMUM WE

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:08.635
ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:09.703
LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:10.837
CONSOLIDATION OF THE TWO

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:12.639
ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE IT DOES DELAY

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:14.040
THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:15.542
INSOLVENCY IN THE BUDGET YEAR

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:16.810
BUT WE WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.044
THAT IT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:19.579
TO MAINTAIN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:20.780
WHEN BOTH ARE GOING TO BECOME

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:23.550
INSOLVENT ANYWAY- BECAUSE BOTH

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.318
PLANS ARE GOING TO BE AND SALAS

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:26.519
AND THERE IS THIS QUESTION

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:28.154
ABOUT HOW THIS INSOLVENCY WOULD

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:29.823
BE ADDRESSED THAT'S NOT PART OF

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:31.691
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL-

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:33.026
WE ARE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.160
THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:36.796
GO FURTHER- WE ARE RECOMMENDING

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:37.831
THAT THE ACCOUNTS TO BE

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.666
ELIMINATED AND THAT FULL

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.101
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIAL FOR

01:50:41.167 --> 01:50:43.069
CONSTRUCTION BE SHIFTED OVER TO

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:46.039
THE GENERAL FUND- SO. ABSENCE

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:48.308
ANY CHANGES SIGNIFICANT GENERAL

01:50:48.375 --> 01:50:49.743
FUND RESOURCES ARE ALREADY

01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:52.579
GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN-

01:50:52.645 --> 01:50:54.047
EXISTING OBLIGATIONS WHICH MOST

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:56.983
NOTABLY IS FINANCING PAYMENTS

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:58.351
FOR A TRUCKER CONSTRUCTION

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:59.753
PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

01:50:59.819 --> 01:51:01.488
COMPLETED. AND TO GIVE YOU AN

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:02.022
IDEA OF WHAT WE MEAN BY

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:04.157
SIGNIFICANT OUR ESTIMATE IS

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.525
THAT AROUND A HUNDRED AND

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:06.192
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:08.595
WOULD BE NEEDED BEGINNING IN

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:09.129
TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:11.431
FOUR. AND GENERAL FUND WOULD BE

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.633
NEEDED THROUGH THE NEXT FIFTEEN

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:14.968
OR SIXTEEN YEARS IT WOULD

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:17.470
DECLINE IN THE OUT YEARS. AS WE

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:19.205
KIND OF COMPLETELY PAY OFF THE

01:51:19.272 --> 01:51:20.707
FACILITIES BUT IT'S NOT AN IN

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:23.276
SYNC IT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:23.910
MONEY AND SO BY SHIFTING THINGS

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:26.613
OVER. IT ENSURES THAT ALL OF

01:51:26.679 --> 01:51:28.481
THE GENERAL FUND RESPONSIBILITY

01:51:28.548 --> 01:51:29.783
THE OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:32.085
ACCOUNTED FOR. WHEN WE ARE

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:34.587
CONSIDERING- SPENDING FROM THE

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:35.688
GENERAL FUND AND THE

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:36.923
LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:38.625
CONSIDER THE STATE'S FISCAL

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:40.827
CONDITION AND DETERMINING ITS

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:41.428
GENERAL FUND SPENDING

01:51:41.494 --> 01:51:42.962
PRIORITIES WITH ALL OF THAT

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:44.431
FULL KNOWLEDGE AT ALL THAT IS

01:51:44.497 --> 01:51:46.399
BEING ACCOUNTED FOR. ALSO IN

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:48.168
LINE WITH THIS ALL OF THE NON

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:49.402
CONSTRUCTION RELATED

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:51.104
EXPENDITURES SUCH AS FOR

01:51:51.171 --> 01:51:52.872
FACILITY- MODIFICATIONS IN FOR

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.374
TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS WOULD

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:56.409
ALSO SHIFT OVER. AND SO THEY

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:57.077
WOULD NEED TO BE AN

01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:59.312
APPROPRIATION TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:01.581
LEVEL OF SUPPORT. FINALLY WE

01:52:01.648 --> 01:52:07.987
ARE ALSO RECOMMENDING. THAT ALL

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:08.621
OF THE CONSTRUCTION RIGHT. ALSO

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:09.289
LEAD TO PAY INTO THE GENERAL SO

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:10.857
THAT THERE'S STILL A BILL. TO

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.659
OFFSET THE X. SHIFTED OVER TO

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:14.828
THE GENERAL FUND AND SO- YOU

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:16.029
KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:52:16.096 --> 01:52:17.864
RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:20.200
COMPETITION WITH OTHER THINGS.

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:22.001
THE GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:23.136
HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:24.637
OBLIGATIONS WHETHER THEY ARE

01:52:24.704 --> 01:52:26.106
NEW OBLIGATIONS MOVING FORWARD

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:27.941
OR OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:52:28.007 --> 01:52:29.976
ALREADY IN HER. WHEN THAT

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:31.411
LEGISLATURE CREATED THE ACCOUNT

01:52:31.478 --> 01:52:32.345
THE ENVISIONED THAT THE

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:33.246
CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS WOULD

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:34.581
HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:36.182
BASICALLY PAY FOR THEM THAT'S

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.317
KIND OF HOW LANGUAGE WAS

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:39.552
ESTABLISHED. GIVEN THE

01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:41.054

AND BASICALLY PAY FOR THEM AND

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.728
SO THERE IS ALREADY GOING TO BE

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:50.663
AN IMPACT. ON GENERAL FUND

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:53.466
SPENDING PRIORITIES AS A

01:52:53.533 --> 01:52:54.601

TO BE DISCUSSING ON THE NEXT

01:52:58.071 --> 01:52:59.973
ISSUE ITEM WE ARE RECOMMENDING

APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:02.942
APPROACH TO FINDING ANY NEW

PROJECTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:05.912
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'LL BE

YOU'LL BE APPROVING PROJECTS

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.215

ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. BUT IT

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:17.056
WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE

01:53:17.123 --> 01:53:19.259
LEGISLATURE IS FULLY AWARE OF

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:21.327

PRIORITY- HOWEVER WE DO

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:31.004
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.639
DETERMINE WHICH SPECIFIC

01:53:32.705 --> 01:53:34.073

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.476
BASED. ON ITS PRIORITIES WHICH

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.211
MAY OR MAY NOT NCLUDE ANY OF

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:38.811
THE PROJECTS THAT YOU'LL BE

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.280

DIFFERENTLY. OR THEY MIGHT

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.705
THINK THAT ADDITIONAL FACTORS

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:06.873

YOU. THANK YOU- THIS IS JACK

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:15.474
AND SAME INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:19.946
SORT. BUT TARGETED WE HAVE.

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:23.282
BOMBINGS SECTION SEVEN THREE

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:24.617
NINE ONE SEVEN THE IS WAS

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:25.851
LIMITED FOR THE DESIGNS ARE

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:27.420
CORRECT METHODOLOGY THAT WE'RE

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:30.556
USING IS NOT DESIGNED AND BUILT

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:31.991
BY CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:33.492
SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS BECAUSE

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.361
WE HOLD TWO SEPARATE CONTRACTS

02:00:35.428 --> 02:00:37.396
ONE WITH ARCHITECT OR DESIGN

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:40.967
TEAM AND ONE WITH A CONTRACTOR.

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:41.534
WHO IS ACTUALLY BUILDING THE

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.502
PROJECT. THERE IS A DISCONNECT

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.705
BETWEEN THE TWO AND WE THE

02:00:45.771 --> 02:00:48.074
OWNER TAKES ADDITIONAL RISK

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.509
BECAUSE OF THE ACT. OF THE ACT

02:00:50.576 --> 02:00:52.244
IF THERE IS A DESIGN ISSUE WE

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:53.713
ARE ON THE HOPE TO GET THAT

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:55.348
CORRECTED BUT THE CONTRACTOR BY

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:56.382
MOVING TO THE DESIGN BUILD

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:58.751
DELIVERY METHOD. WE WOULD

02:00:58.818 --> 02:00:59.885
ELIMINATE THE ACTRESS THAT

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.220
WRESTLING SHIFT OVER TO THE

02:01:01.287 --> 02:01:02.788
DESIGN BUILD AND HE BECAUSE LAW

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:04.857
IT WILL BE ON THE CONTRACTOR TO

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:07.560
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THE CAR IN

02:01:07.627 --> 02:01:09.295
THE DESIGN BUILD METHODOLOGY

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:12.431
THOUGH. THE OWNERS ONLY SOLD

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.400
CONTRACTORS WITH THE CONTRACTOR

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.002
AND THE DESIGNERS UNDER THE

02:01:16.068 --> 02:01:19.305
CONTRACTOR SO THAT IS THE

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.940
PRIMARY REASON FOR SHIFTING-

02:01:21.007 --> 02:01:22.975
OUR RISK AND REDUCING OUR RISK

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:24.543
FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. I

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:27.546
WOULD ALSO MENTION BACK. ON ON

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.815
THE AVERAGE THE DESIGN. IS MUCH

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:35.021
MORE FASTER THAN CMR. PROCESS

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:36.188
BECAUSE WE CAN DO. THE STOCK

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:38.557

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:44.630
THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE.

02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:46.898
THE MAPS- IN SOME YOU KNOW

THERE'S A LOT OF AN ADD ON. TO

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.859
THESE TRAFFIC TICKETS WE THINK

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.127
THIS WOULD BE A MORE EQUITABLE

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:16.328
APPROACH THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:18.130

ELIMINATION OF MANY OF THE

JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROPOSAL AND

AGREEMENT THERE THERE ARE FAR

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:25.717
TOO HIGH BUT THE ONLINE TOOL IS

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:26.952
NOT THE BEST APPROACH TO DO

02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:29.221
THAT- FIRST TOPIC PRIVILEGES

SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT IT DOES ACT

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.799
AS A HURDLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:42.400
THAT NEED THAT TOOL FOR USING

02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:44.035
THAT ONLINE APPROACH TO LOWER

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.476
THE ONLINE TOOL ALSO HELPS

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:53.278
PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT COUNTY

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:54.846
DIFFERENTLY IT TENDS TO DO MORE

02:15:54.913 --> 02:15:56.781
FOR THOSE IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:57.616
THOSE IN VENTURA COUNTY FOR

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:59.784
EXAMPLE- WHY WOULD WE CHOOSE

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:00.952
THE STRATEGY PRED DRAFTING

DON'T DESERVE MORE MERCY THAN

02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:06.858
THOSE WHO VENTURE OUT. AND WE

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:07.826
SHOULD COME UP WITH A STRATEGY

02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:09.394
THAT'S MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:12.097
UNIFORM. THERE'S JUST NO SENSE

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:13.398
IN LOADING PEOPLE UP WITH MATH

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:15.267

NEED FRONT AND REFORM AND FOR

02:16:18.970 --> 02:16:19.971
THAT REASON WE NEED TO

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:21.773
ELIMINATE OF WHAT THAT MEANT.
