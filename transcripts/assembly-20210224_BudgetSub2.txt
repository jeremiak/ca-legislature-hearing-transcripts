HEARING. ON K. TWELVE ISSUES THAT WE DID NOT FINISH- TWO WEEKS AGO- AND- SO TODAY WE HAVE SOME MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET RELATING COMMITTEE SCHOOLS MEDICAL BILLING STATEMENTS TO HELP SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA AND THE COLLABORATION FOR EDUCATION ACCESS LISTEN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WELL THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. AND I WISH WE HAD SOME GREAT NEWS TO REPORT ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS RE OPENING BUT- I'M FEELING OPTIMISTIC- MORE AND MORE VACCINES ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED AROUND. CALIFORNIA JUST THAT TODAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID A PRELIMINARY GREENLIGHTED JOHNSON JOHNSON THE THIRD VACCINE SO THAT SHOULD BE HAVING THE FINAL ACTION LATER THIS WEEK AND THERE'S- MILLIONS ARE A DELIBERATE CROSS CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY MILLION. MILLIONS ACROSS THE STATE THE NATION AND TWENTY MILLION BY THE END OF MARCH THEY SAID FOR JOHNSON AND JOHNSON. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE COUNCIL JUST GOING DOWN. THE CROSS THAT THE STATE ANYWAY SO HOPEFULLY WE AS A LEGISLATURE CAN VOTE TO. MAKE IT EVEN EASIER FOR DISTRICTS TO RICK TO RE OPEN AND THAT PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR THEIR RE OPENING AND LEARNING LOSS SO THAT'S OUR CONTINUED ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A BUDGET TO. RECONCILE SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THOSE THOSE ISSUES THAT TODAY SO- WITH THAT WE HAVE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE L. A. L. CORRECT. YEAH YEAH. YEAH AND OF COURSE THIS IS AT OUR PREPARED REMARKS FOR THIS. PUBLICLY DISTANCE ARE A PUBLIC NOTICE FOR AT THAT SOCIALLY DISTANCE- COMMITTEE ROOM TODAY WE'RE IN ROOM FOUR THIRTY SEVEN- WE'RE A LARGE- AND OF ROOM FOR SOME PUBLIC COMMENTS TO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE PARTICIPATING HERE JUST YET WILL HAVE ONE MINUTE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END. AND WILL HAVE A CALL THE NUMBER THAT YOU CAN- ENGAGE WITH AS WELL THAT WILL BE- PRESENTED ON THE SCREEN OUT AS WELL AS ALL READ IT LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. SO WITH THAT LET'S PROCEED WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AFTERNOON SHERRIN MEMBERS LIZ MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THE UDGET PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND CHECK SPENT ON THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. TO HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN. SO COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OFFER A UNIQUE MODEL TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE INTEGRATED EDUCATIONAL. HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS- WITH A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS. SO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO EXISTING LANGUAGE AROUND THE PROGRAM- BUT THE KITCHEN THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS EXPANDING AND ENHANCING. EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. SO COMMUNITIES GRANTS WOULD SUPPORT LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL WHICH ARE PROVIDING INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES OFFERING EXTENDED LEARNING TIME IN LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS AND OFFERING SUPPORT FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- ADDITIONALLY UP 21% OF THE ALLOCATION TO ME YEARS FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS WHO WANT TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH THEIR OWN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU L. L. MORNING TURN MEMBERS MICHAEL OFFICE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR THREE CONCERNS AN ASSOCIATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO MODIFY THE PROPOSAL. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS RELATED TO THE STATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE STUDENT ESCORT OUTCOMES HOWEVER SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES THAT CAN BE COMPLICATED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IMPLEMENT. SCHOOL DISTRICT WITHOUT PRIOR EXPERIENCE OPERATING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MAYBE HELP LEARNING HOW TO DEVELOP EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS COLLABORATE WITH OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES. HI I'M GOING A NEW STREAMS TO IMPLEMENT AND SUSTAIN IT NEEDS BECAUSE MODEL. TRANSLATION IS NOT SPECIFY HOW THE STATE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND YOU KNOW THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE'RE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. PARTNER STANDING IS A CVS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH PROVIDERS FOR THE FIRST TIME TO GRANT. HOWEVER SINCE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SECOND UNDERGRADS INCLUDES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT MAY BE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXISTING ONES. RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SEPT SPECIFIC. REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AT A MINIMUM WE RECOMMEND THE LET'S THE STATE. OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST SCHOOLS WITH CONDUCTING A COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT. INCLUDING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. CREATING ANY PARTNERSHIPS AND DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCES. WE RECOMMEND ASSISTANCE BE AVAILABLE FOR PROSPECT. OF THE KINGS AND GRANT RECIPIENTS. OUR THINKING CONCERN IS WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FOUR IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THE AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR FINANCED WITH THE SUPPORT AND AMPLE EXTRACTION. IF THEY WOULD HAVE 21% OF THE FUNDING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THE EXTENT THAT SPECIFIC TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS I DISCUSS WOULD REQUIRE SPENDING MORE THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL GRANT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE SAID OF CYBER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE PROPOSAL GRANT WILL PROVIDE ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION. WHICH OPEN. FOR EACH YEAR OF THE GRANT WITH IS ABOUT SOMEONE HIGHER PART- SORRY RELATIVE TO THE FIRST PRINT. TO ASSIST WITH THAT MY OF FISH THE LEGISLATURE COULD SCV FOR IN SPRING WITH HIM OF TECHNICAL. AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE FIRST FROM THE GRANTEES. WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THAT SINCE THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THERE WILL LIKELY BE MORE NEED FOR SUBSTANTIAL. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS. ARE THERE CONCERNS. WITH A JAIL LEGISLATION APPEARS TO CLINTON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AT A DISADVANTAGE. THE PRIORITIES LISTED IN THE CHAIR LANGUAGE. FOR SELECTING GRANTEES IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST FROM THE GRANTS AND INCLUDES THINGS SUCH AS HAVING COMMITTED MATCHING FUNDS FOR PEOPLE SERVICES AND HAVING A PLAN FOR SUSTAINING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THIS IS DR GRANT EXPLORATION. IS CRITERIA PUT EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT ARE FARTHER ALONG AN IMPLEMENTATION AT A DISADVANTAGE OR NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOLS TO ENSURE GRANTS ARE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE STRIP FUNDING INTO TWO SEPARATE GRANTS. ONE FOR EXPANDING EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND ONE FIRST PUBLISHING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THIS PPROACH WOULD EXPAND THE MODEL MORE EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE AND SIR FUNDING CAN BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THAT THE NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. SERVICES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER PUSHING INTO APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THOSE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS TO LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR THIS WOULD GIVE ELEAZAR MORE TIME TO SEE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO APPLICATION THAT ONE. OF THE SECOND BECAUSE OUR COMMENTS HAVE EVIDENCE. ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. YOU ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE TO OF PUBLIC AND- COMMITTEE SCHOOL ARE ONE OF THE STATE'S PRIORITIES AND HE HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK IN THIS AREA BECAUSE COMMUNITY SCHOOL SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRAUMA INFORMED CARE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND MANY OTHER KEY SUPPORTS SCHOOLS CAN YOU THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NURSES COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. TRADING PLACES WHERE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE SERVICES NEEDED TO HELP CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR CAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM GRANT. THE CITY RECEIVED A HUNDRED INTO APPLET APPLICATIONS WITH A TOTAL ASK OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH IS NEARLY FOUR TIMES THE TOTAL FUNDS ALLOTTED THE CDC WILL ANNOUNCE CULINARY AWARDS SHORTLY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE GRANT PROCESS WAS VERY COMPETITIVE WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTY NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED AT THE CUT OFF FOR GRANTEES. THE TOTAL THE TOTAL PERHAPS WILL GO TO THE TOTAL GRANT FUNDS EXCUSE ME WILL TO GRANT. AND THEN INCLUDE BOTH CONSORTIA AND SAY SCHOOL AT WITH THE WORDS FROM HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND HUNDRED TO MILLION. IT IS. THAT THE DEMAND FOR THESE. IF HIGHER. THAN FUNDS THAT WERE A LOT LAST YEAR. WE INTO THE THAT THE DEMAND BE MUCH. ON THE GOVERNOR SCRIPT. BECAUSE THE PRE ROUND OF. WITHIN TO A- COMMUNITIES FOR. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE THIS NEW. WHEN COUPLED THE INCREASE TIMELINE FOR USING THE FUNDS WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE EVEN GREATER DEMAND FOR THIS NEW ROUND OF FUNDING. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY PEAK CALLOUS AND LISA REMMERS ACCOUNT AT THE COLLEGE AND CAREER TRANSITIONS DIVISION AT THE EASY ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC. QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU OKAY. WE'RE GONNA SEE MISTER. I LIKED I LIKED HIM IT JUST HELLO AND SEE IF MY KIDS AND HAVE HIM HERE AND THERE. SO SHOW YOUR FACE MISTER. AMONG.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- HOW MANY OF THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODELS FUNDED THROUGH THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE REMAIN OPERATIONAL. SO DO WE HAVE CITY AIRPORT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANSWER THAT QUESTION DRESS THESE ISSUES. SO I CAN START AND I NEED TO ASK KEEP TO JUMP IN AGAIN ALEXANDER FROM IT FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES SUPERINTENDENT THE CITY HAS NOT ADMINISTER THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE SINCE NEED FIRST TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT'S GONNA TAKE US SOMETIME TO RESEARCH THE HEALTHY START PROGRAM WE STARTED TO LOOK INTO THIS. BUT IT WILL TAKE THE TIME TO REVIEW THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE- SO UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT. AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THIS TIME I'D KEEP WE HAVE A CONTINUING PROGRAM. HI I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE HOPE THE STORE WASN'T PART OF OUR DIVISION HILLS AND A DIFFERENT DIVISION WITHIN CITY SO WE HAVE TO DO SOME RESEARCH WE TRY TO DO SOME RESEARCH LAST WEEK ON IT AND MOST OF THE DATA NO LONGER EXISTS ON OUR WEBSITE. AND YOU THINK THAT THAT SAID SO INITIALLY THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE PLANNING GRANTS AND- THE END OF THESE GRANTS IT DID IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OPERATIONAL NINETEEN COMBINED GRANTS. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW IT THOSE OF IMPACTED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY SCHOOL SITES AND IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND USEFUL- TO KNOW HOW MANY ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE- MY NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND THE ORIGINAL AGAIN THE ORIGINAL HSA. AWARDS THEY'RE FUNDED FOR BOTH PLANNING AND OPERATIONAL GRANTS IS THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PLANNING AND OPERATIONAL GRANTS AS WELL AS PROVIDING SEPARATE ALLOCATIONS FOR NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOL EFFORTS. VERSES THOSE PROPOSING TO EXPAND AN EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOL AND I ASK THIS BECAUSE I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO KNOW IF THEY SHOULD BE- IF AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS ARE LOOKING FOR NEW TWENTY SHOULD REALLY BE IN THE SAME CATEGORY. CATEGORY AS EXIST PROGRAM THAT ARE ARE WE IMAGINE MUCH MORE COME VERSUS A NEW START UP. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AMORALITY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION WE DO- AGREE WITH A LOT OF VELLIOS RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA.

AND IT WAS A IT WAS A IT WAS A SUCCESS- A LOT OF ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS THEREFORE NOT JUST IN THAT STUDENTS AFTER SCHOOL BUT THAT THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND AFTER I THINK THAT RECESSION IS WHEN THEY KIND OF FIZZLED OUT SO I THE CONCEPT IS A GOOD ONE AND YOU KNOW HAVING MORE SEX. SCHOOLS NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SOMETHING WE CAN ALL SUPPORT SO AT THE L. A. L. SUGGESTION IT IS I THINK NOT A BAD ONE SO WE CAN HELP MORE IN THE PIPELINE- SO WHAT DOES THE PERMANENT FINANCE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT THE ONLY- SUGGESTION- IN TERMS OF SPLITTING OUT AND DOES MAKE SENSE AND- I THINK WE WOULD. FURTHER CONVERT ST ANNE'S RECOGNIZING- AS THE PERMANENT EDUCATION POINT OUT THAT. THERE WAS THE PRIVATE COMING IN AND THERE WERE APPLICATIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED NOT AROUND THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BE COMPLETED OR FUNDED AT ALL.

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. NEXT PRESENTER. ALAIA GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AMY LEE WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS AFTERNOON I WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE GOVERNOR'S MEDICAL BILLING PROPOSALS BEFORE SHARING OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION BRIEFLY BY WAY OF BACKGROUND SCHOOLS HAVE THE OPTION TO SEEK PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR SOME HEALTH RELATED SERVICES FROM MEDIC HELL THROUGH THE SCHOOL BASED MEDICAL BILLING PROGRAM COVERED LOW PARTICIPATION HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE IN THE PROGRAM AS ONLY ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATE COVERING A VERY SMALL SHARK SHARE OF K. TWELVE STUDENTS STATE WIDE. IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN THE PROGRAM IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO JOINTLY CONVENED A WORKGROUP FOCUSED ON MEDICAL BILLING THE WORK GROUP IS TASKED WITH PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION AND THE MEDICAL BILLING PROGRAM CHAMISA CONDITIONS ARE DUE OUT BY OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR THE WORKERS INTERIM REPORT WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL BARRIERS TO PROGRAM PARTICIPATION INCLUDING A LACK OF INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION BETWEEN CD AND DH CS. CHALLENGING DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS A HIGH SURE CLEANS BEING DISALLOWED AND LIMITED STATE LIVE TRAINING AND SUPPORT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS WHICH FINANCES ALREADY DESCRIBED WE RECOGNIZE THAT DISTRICTS NEED MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING PROGRAM HOWEVER GIVEN THAT THE MEDICAL BILLING WORKGROUP WILL HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS OUT TO FURTHER ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN OCTOBER WE THINK THESE PROPOSALS ARE RATHER PREMATURE FURTHERMORE- THE GOT THE WORKERS INTERIM REPORT HIGHLIGHTED A POTENTIAL NEED FOR STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP WHICH MAY BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SCHOOLS THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WE ASSESSED THAT MEDICAL BILLING PROPOSALS NEXT YEAR FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROCESS AFTER IT HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE FINAL WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CONCLUDES OUR REMARKS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE OF A- OKAY- ALEXANDER BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE STATE- STATE SUPERINTENDENT APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TALLY IS TO ACCESS FEDERAL MEDICAL FUNDS THE S. AND P. I. HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED HOW MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ELEAZAR MISSING OUT ON TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS. BUT WITHIN FOR IMPORTANT UP ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING KIND OF SERVICES ARE CHILDREN SO DESPERATELY NEED MAN ISSUE THAT IS MADE ALL ONLY BEEN MADE MORE APPARENT AS THE AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES ON ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ONLY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE ELEAZAR PARTICIPATED IN THE MEDIC HOW BILLING PROGRAM IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. A NUMBER THAT HAS INCREASED ONLY BY ONE ALLEY EIGHT IN EACH YEAR SINCE FISCAL YEAR TWELVE THIRTEEN OF THOSE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE L. E. EIGHT THANK THAT WAS AT LEAST GOING TO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION WHICH IS THE DIGNITY CREASE OF NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE THAN 10% FROM THE HIGH POINT IN FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. THESE NUMBERS SHOW THE NEED FOR ACTION IN THE SPACE IS VERY REAL THE PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY ARE ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE SOLUTION HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCENTIVIZE MEDI CAL PLANS TO INVEST IN DELIVERING CRITICAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE OTHER YEAH IT'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR LEDS EXPANDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AND EXPERIENCE TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL BILLING. THERE ARE ALSO SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SUCH AS CRITERIA AND LED FLEX A PROCESS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ON HOW BEST TO PUT ALL OF THESE PIECES TOGETHER SO THEIR CHILDREN GET THE SERVICES THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED WHILE ENSURING THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE BREAKING THE BANK IN THE PROCESS. I HAVE WITH ME SERRA NOVEL MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT CDT ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. QUEST ARE CALM YOU CAN MEMBERS. MISTER DONNA. WITH REGARD TO THE MEDICAL BILLING PROGRAM- SCHOOLS WOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FOR I'M LOOKING FOR HERE COUNSELING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SPEECH THERAPY AND TRANSPORTATION SOME ABOUT HALF THE SCHOOLS ALREADY. DO BILL FOR THAT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. HASKELL DISTRICT PROBABLY. IT COULD SOMEONE RESPONDING. TO ALLIE GARNER FROM CD WE UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE ELEAZAR CURRENTLY UTILIZE THE ALLEY A MEDICAL BILLING PROCESS USES ABOUT HALF AND THEY CAN'T BILL FOR I'M JUST LOOKING INTO THE REASONS LISTED IN. IN THE DOCUMENT I HAVE TO COUNSELING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SPEECH THERAPY AND TRANSPORTATION BUT NOT FOR GENERAL HEALTH PURPOSES IS THAT ACCURATE SO IF SOMEONE WAS FEELING ILL THAT DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE AN ALLOWABLE. A BILLABLE- SITUATION THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FOR THAT FOR DRESSING THAT ISSUE AT A SCHOOL SITE IS THAT ACCURATE. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION THE BILLABLE ANSWER IT THE LITTLE QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IT IS THE MARK OF WHY WE NEED THIS WORK HERE AND WHY WE NEED STATE LEVEL SUPPORT BECAUSE NEITHER CVS NOR DH CS REALLY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ANSWERS TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT DOES AND DOESN'T HAPPEN DOES OR DOES NOT HAPPEN. ON AN ALLEY A BUILDING SITE. OKAY IMAGE I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO GET A WHAT SERVICES MIGHT BE OFFERED. AT LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT AS ONE WHO TEACHES THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE. THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPENING THERE. BUT THE TOWNS OVER TO A DIFFERENT. I GET I GET THAT QUESTION ANSWERED LATER. BOB THE DEVOUT 50% OF SCHOOL ADMITTED IT'S NOT SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM YOU SIDE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE. SO THE INTENT IN THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO IT IS THAT IT. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES. IT'S TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM ELEAZAR- IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND THAT THOSE WHO DO- DO NAVIGATE THE PROGRAM OFTEN FIND- FIND TROUBLE ON THE BACK AND AFTER SUBMITTING CLAIMS- IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING THE AUDIT PROCESS SO THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS TO THE PROGRAM THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT. I'M DH CS IT IS TRYING TO ASSIST LEN ACTING BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT CONNECTION TO THE EDUCATIONAL- EXCEPT- OVER AT THE AGE S. THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE MARKED THAT- CARE TO CARE L. EA- ELLIE EIGHT. EIGHT AM. TYPE OF CAPACITY BUILDING AND REALLY WHY ARE- FROM THE MEASURE IS TRYING TO GET BACK. THANK YOU. IN THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR HERE AND I THINK THAT SURE WOULD AGREE WITH ME THIS IS A SEVENTY YEAR WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE. SO SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE. THAT WE HAVE TO FIND. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HOW DO WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW. YOU KNOW GATHER SOME EXPERTS TO GOING TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING IT WHY CAN'T I JUST DON'T HOW HARD CAN IT BE OR WHO'S MAKING IT SO HARD AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT. OR IS THE STATE. THE LOGISTICS WITH APPLYING TO THE STATE PROGRAM THE STATE MEDICAL BILLING SYSTEM. MORE DOUBLE I MEAN WONDERING IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE SCHOOL AND MAYBE. IT OR IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILLING SYSTEM. MAYBE WE NEED TO INSTEAD OF. WORRY ABOUT THE SCHOOLS MANY WORRY ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THE BUILDING FROM THE SCHOOL SITES DID YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT. SO MAYBE FINANCE. AMBER ALEXANDER- AGAIN WITH THE PERSONAL FINANCE- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS THIS PROPOSAL BUT THAT MINISTRATIONS SUPPORT IS REALLY JUST ONE PIECE RECOGNIZING THAT- THE SQ SEVENTY FIVE WORKGROUP IS REALLY- CURRENTLY DELVING INTO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AROUND PROGRAMMATIC. REFORM THAT MAY NEED TO BE- MAKE MAY NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED- AROUND L. A. BACH PROGRAM I'M I MEAN ABOUT THAT DH CS AND ALSO LOOKING AT THEM. C. D. E. AND THEIR NEEDS AND HOW THEY CAN ASSIST IN THIS AREA SO THIS IS THIS IS ONE PIECE THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM- BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S AN IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT HOPEFULLY NETWORK GROUP AND WHEN THEY RELEASED THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OCTOBER. WE'LL GET MORE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE- BRINGING UP AS WELL AS MOVEMENT-O'DONNELL. OKAY THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES I JUST. I THINK THERE'S MORE HERE THAN I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS MOE THAN MONEY- YEAH YEAH THAT'S KNOWLEDGE. IT'S THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- BUT IF IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO DO THAT HALF OF THEM AR DOING IT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM HERE TO WHICH I THINK YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE- SO. I JUST HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS. IN ANOTHER A- MY BECAUSE I'M WORRIED THAT WE WILL IT SEEMS LIKE. WE'VE CREATED OUR OWN PROBLEM WE'VE CREATED OUR OWN WALL HERE. THAT WE CAN NOW JUMP OVER. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EXACTLY THAT'S THEIR NUMBER MORE AGAIN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO I'M ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LANDS ON THE WORK GREAT AND I. FEEL THE BEST WHAT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I AM IN NO WAY AND MEDICARE BILLING EXPERT BUT WE ARE IN- IN THESE MEETINGS AT LEAST EVERY OTHER WEEK OR FIVE SERVICE THAT. PART THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE EIGHTH AS THAT MAJOR PAIN POINTS. LATE IN THE BILLING PROCESS. AUDITING COMPONENT THAT. A CEMENT BELLS AND IT CAN UP TO A FOR THEM TO GO SOMETHING THAT NOT. AND THEN THEY HAVE NO WAY TO RECOUP THIS COST. THAT WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION IN THAT PENDING. THERE ARE MERGING RECOMMENDATION COMPONENT THAT WOULD DEEPLY INVESTIGATE THAT PROCESS AND MAKE CHANGES TO SHORTEN THE TIME PERIOD AROUNDS THE AUDIT TEAM SAID THE ALLEY. CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY. THEY ALSO. NEED TO BE. IN WHAT HOW CLEAR IT IS WHAT'S- TO REALLY AT LEAST WITH THAT. BUT WE REALLY ELEVATED THE PROCEED TO HAVE STRONGER CAPACITY IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS HAVE. HEALTHCARE SERVICES I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT LONGER. THANK MARK THANK YOU LISTEN I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE A DOCTORATE ACCOUNTING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BILL. ESPECIALLY FROM THE L. E. A. LEVEL THIS MUST BE IS HAS TO BE. MADE TO BE A SIMPLER PROCESS- SO I. I HOPE WE CAN FIX THIS BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE'VE CREATED OUR OWN PROBLEM AND ARE RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES. AND I'M SURE SOMEONE OTHER THAN A HIGH KNOWS THE ANSWER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT'S PROBABLY INTO PLACE IS PROBABLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL YES. DEVELOPING AN EXPERTISE ON THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ALSO THAT YOU KNOW. HOW THE IF IT'S SO DIFFICULT. TO APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE A HURDLE TOO MANY LOOK AT THAT PROCESS WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE DOING SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA NOTICES. I'M SO IF THE INTERAGENCY WORKGROUPS FINAL REPORT IS DUE ON OCTOBER FIRST WHY WHY NOT WAIT AND FOR THE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS NOVEL I MEAN WOULDN'T. THAT POTENTIALLY CREATE A FALSE START OR EVEN MORE CONFUSION FOR ELEAZAR. IF I MAY I LIKE HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR WAS THAT THERE'S A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT THE PLANET AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR RETRACTED BILLING PRESS THE FIVE YEARS. THAT CLOCK STARTED LAST JULY AND SO THE LONGER WE WAIT THE LONGER SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AND RETROACTIVELY BELL. SO WE CAN START BUILDING SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ROUTES TO THE FINALIZATION OF THIS SB SEVENTY FIVE REPORT I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE AHEAD ON THAT CAPACITY. SO IS THIS. DOES THIS PROPOSAL REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S. YOU KNOW- GOAL OF USING. PROP NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROBABLY A MEDICAL BILLING RATHER THAN FEDERAL FUNDS OR NON PROP NINETY. RESOURCES. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WORK WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO- CONVERSATION AROUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE AT A FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE THAT MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT AND THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD I'M PROP PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING- ONE BECAUSE WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PUT OUT A STRONG SIGNAL THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S- CARRIED DEEPLY ABOUT AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME MONEY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT ON THE TABLE WELL. FIRST BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT. THE CONVERSATION CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS JUST THE OBVIOUS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY CALIFORNIANS THE KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND- HE SUPPORT LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. THAT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT WE FREE ASISTIR TAL SAID. WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT- THIS A YOU KNOW PART OF ME WANTS TO KNOW WHY WE'RE NOT HERE WITH. OUR HEALTHCARE SITE TO DIFFERENT FROM THAT THAT PERSPECTIVE. IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT- DAY THE K. TWELVE SIDE OF THIS THING START HAVING SOME EXPERTISE FROM THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL SO MISTER TRICK AND I JUST COMMON YET MR THAT IT WAS SO IS DH CS IS THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WITH INSTANCE WERE.% CORRECT BECAUSE I HEAR THERE THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE AUDITING CREW THAT COMES IN HERE AND CREATES A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR DISTRICTS SO WHY ISN'T- YOU KNOW. WHAT WHILE SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BLOWING THEM UP SO THIS CAN GET FIXED. I MEAN THIS SEEMS TO BE LIKE WE'RE CREATING THIS LONG PATH TO FIND A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM WE ALREADY KNOW THE PROBLEM. RIGHT SO I THINK WE KNOW THE SOLUTION. AND SO I MAYBE PERSONNEL WISE SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS AND ARGUING OVER BUDGETS IN EXCESS. THIS SHOULD BE FIXED. SEVEN YEARS AGO EASILY. OKAY POINT MADE WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- THE NEXT ISSUE NUMBER THREE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALL BUT IF YOU'RE PAYING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT SCHOOLS ARE CRITICAL POINT OF ACCESS FOR PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ARMILLARY DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THE PROTRACTOR IN THE PADDOCK. FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH CHALLENGES AND PROMOTE WELLNESS GOALS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SEVERAL INITIATIVES AIMED TO INCREASE RESOURCES AND COORDINATE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR TODAY'S HEARING I'LL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MATCHING FUNDS FOR CLOSING THE HEALTH. THE PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT CHILDREN'S MNTAL HEALTH THANK MANY DISCUSS THE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND FOR FIGHTING I'M EVERYTHING REPORTERS DISTRICT IN THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. ELEAZAR COUNTY. THE FUNDING MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE HEALTH NEEDS TO KEEP YOUR CALL IT AN IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH A WHOLE CHILD APPROACH. AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECOURT NETWORK. SUPPORT FOR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR COMPETITIVE GRANT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE A ONE DOLLAR PROP NINETY EIGHT MATCH PROBABLY ONE DOLLAR A FUNDING AND COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THREE YEAR SPENDING PLAN THAT IS DEDICATED TO A PROJECT THAT SUPPORTS CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SCHOOL. I LEAVE BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING AND WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY PARTNERED ON A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE PROJECT. WITHIN THE COUNTY FOR YOUR SPENDING PLAN TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR SETTING. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OFFERING TWO ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PROPOSALS. THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT I MEET AT THE STATE PARTNERSHIP RANT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE EXISTING PROGRAM. WITH PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BALK AND ADDRESSING THROUGH FIGHTING SHOPPACH EVENTUALLY SERVICES. OUTREACH HIGHER YOU AND OTHER STRATEGIES THAT REFLECT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THE SECOND PROPOSAL IF FORTY MILLION AND ONE TIME BUDGET FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THROUGH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. CAN CREATE THE NUMBER K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE EARLY INTERVENTION AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MY SCHOOL AFFILIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. BUT A LOT OF PROPOSED. WILL BE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL DURING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I THINK WITH MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. EMAIL ME WITH THE L. A. L. WE WANTED TO SHARE SOME BACKGROUND AND THEN ARE ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION ON THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL MENTAL. I'M IN RECENT YEARS NUMEROUS REPORTS HAVE INDICATED MORE STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THESE ISSUES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC THE STATE SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH HOWEVER IS FRAGMENTED AND INCLUDES VARIOUS ENTITIES WITH OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES A CHILD WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS COULD RECEIVE EDUCATION RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM HER SCHOOL AND ALSO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN ORANGE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR MEDICAL REASONS AND THE SERVICE IS OFTEN ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT COORDINATION ACROSS ENTITIES. ITS RECOMMENDATION BECOMES AN ISSUE WHEN THE STATE WANTS TO INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN BUT IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHAT THE BEST APPROACH WOULD BE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING POP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO MATCH COUNTY SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTS THE PROPOSAL AIMS TO INCREASE COUNTY SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. GENERALLY GIVEN CONCERNS OVER STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH WE THINK PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO INCREASE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES IS REASONABLE HOWEVER WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERTS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FIRST AND FOR MOST OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LARGELY OVERLAPS AND DUPLICATES OTHER SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET PROPOSALS CURRENTLY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE FOR INSTANCE AS FINANCE MENTIONED IN THIS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO AUGMENT A SEPARATE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE EXISTING PARTNERSHIP GRANTS AND THE MATCHING FUNDS SHARE MANY SIMILARITIES. BOTH ARE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS TARGETED TO COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE MATCHING FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED BY CVG SCHOOLS RATHER THAN EIGHT THROUGH A STATE COMMISSION TO COUNTIES AS IS THE CASE WITH THE EXISTING PARTNERSHIP GRANTS HOW THESE PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO BE COORDINATED IS UNCLEAR ESPECIALLY SINCE NOTHING PREVENTS DISTRICTS FROM RECEIVING BOTH OF THE PARTNERSHIP GRANT AND THE MATCHING FUNDS WHICH WOULD LIMIT OTHER DISTRICTS ACCESS TO THESE BONDS. ADDITIONALLY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. FOCUSED ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING COULD POLLACHI FOR MATCH FUNDS MAYBE ACTIVITY BUT ALSO BE FUNDED I OTHER. FOR THANK YOU WE ARE. IF THE MATCHING FUNDS WOULD ULTIMATELY INCREASE COUNTY SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH AS INTENDED. THE STATE DOESN'T COLLECT DATA ON COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S SERVICES MEANING IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WHAT ABOUT SHE KNEW COUNTY SPENDING OR MATCH EXISTING FUNDS THAT ARE ALREADY DEDICATED TO THESE SERVICES. LASTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL LARGELY DUE TO THE LACK OF DETAIL AVAILABLE. OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY OF THESE DETAILS WOULD BE LEFT UP TO SEE DO EAT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO DECIDE. AS A RESULT IT'S- UNCLEAR HOW APPLICATIONS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE. FOR ITS AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE FINDING WHETHER TO EXPAND ITS FINDINGS. EXPANDED SERVICES COULD BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT MATCHING FUNDS AND HOW THE APPLICATION IT WOULD ADDRESS THAT BEING A TEACHER THE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS WOULD HAVE AND APPLYING. IT IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE FIND A WORKGROUP FOCUSED ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATING SERVICES. GIVEN THE FACT MEDITATION AND LACK OF COORDINATION IN THE CURRENT STATE SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. ACROSS AGENCY WORKER COULD IDENTIFY GAPS. IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. WARNING SERVICES. THAT'S PRACTICES FOR INTER. COLLABORATION SO. REVENUE SOURCE INCLUDING WHETHER ONGOING POP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS ARE NEEDED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE COORDINATED STATEWIDE APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESS. TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS IN A SCHOOL SETTING. SECONDLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE MATCHING FUNDS PROPOSAL THE MATCHING FUNDS PROPOSAL LARGELY DUPLICATE. OTHER EFFORTS OF OTHER PROPOSED PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE SOME TIME TO RESULT IN AN INCREASE WILL BE SERVICES. AND WOULD HAVE LIMITED IMPACT OVER TIME AND ACROSS THE STATE THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT ONGOING COMPANY FUNDING FOR SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH AT A LATER TIME AFTER A RECOMMENDED WORKER COMPLETES ITS WORK. THAT CONCLUDES OUR REMARKS BUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. OKAY QUESTIONS. YEAH I'LL START HERE SO AS WITH THE LAST ISSUED SEEMS THAT WE RIGHTFULLY SO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON A REGULAR BASIS CERTAINLY. THE NEW MENTAL AT THE APRIL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS IS AS IT YOU KNOW AS A BIG FACTOR IN STUDENT SUCCESS AND SO WE ALL WANT TO. SUPPORT THE EFFORTS- HI I DO NOT. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE INCREASED MONEY FOR PROP SIXTY THREE THROUGH THE COUNTY IS GOING DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOLS AND SO WE HAVE KIND THIS HODGEPODGE. OF SUPPORT WHICH THE L. A. O. NOTES. AND- THANK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT SOMETHING THEY'RE ON TO SOMETHING AS FAR AS- HAVING MORE COORDINATION AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE WORKGROUP TECH TO BETTER COORDINATE. I JUST MUCH CERTAIN IF EVERY YEAR WE HAVE- WE HAVE PART OF MONEY OVER HERE WE CAN FOCUS ON IT WE GIVE IT RIGHT TO HELP ELEAZAR AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S- IF WE'RE FOCUSING AND ACCORDING MANNER SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. HOW I'M GONNA FINANCE BUT WE SEE THAT CURRENT PROPOSALS OF WORKING TOGETHER TO HELP BRING DIFFERENT ENTITY TO THE TABLE TO BALTIMORE COMPETE WITH THEM DEPARTAMENTAL HOCKEY FOR CHILDREN THE GOAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION IF INCREASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FOR AROUND FOUR AND THE THREE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND TO PROVIDE DISCONTENT THAT EACH ENTITY THE DALLAS A THREE WAY PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE WE'RE AWARE THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN CHALLENGES IN. COORDINATING EFFORTS IN THE PAST. MY EIGHT MATCH AND THE ALLEY TO WORK WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THAT AND MAKE A THE STATE PARK PLANS BY THE COUNTY TO WORK WITH THE AID. AND I THINK ETHICAL AND THE MEDIC MANAGED PLANS WORK WITH L. AND COUNTY. ALL PEOPLE IN TO BUILD BETTER RELATIONS WE CAN VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT CHILDREN. THE DOCTOR PACKAGE IN FACT TO BETTER CORNY EFFORTS. TO LEVERAGE DATING BACK. IN ORDER TO MARK. ADDRESS NOT HEALTH NEEDS THE. SO DOES THIS MEAN AS FAR AS AND CAL. THERE'S A SCHOOL THIS RIGHT THE STREET HERE. ZACKS OR TWIN RIVERS. SILVA THOSE L. A. GET RID TO HIGH MORE. PERSONNEL ON CAMPUS OR THE BEACH. CONTRACTED THROUGH HEALTH AGENCIES WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WILL THIS MEAN TO A COMMUNITY THAT CREDIT AND- AND EDUCATION COMMUNITY THAT HAS A DESIRE FOR INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THEIR KIDS. SEARCH FOR THAT PERFECT PROP NINETY EIGHT MATCH A WEEK YOU HAVE AT. SEVERAL ACTIVITIES WITH THAT I THINK ARE ALSO LISTED ON YOUR EXACT BY WHAT THE FUNDING COULD BE USED FOR THAT COULD INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS IDENTIFY EARLY WARNING SIGNS AND RISK FACTORS THE NEED OF MEDICAL HELP THE FIGHT. EXPANDING MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING FACT DEVELOPING SUPPORT NETWORK DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND DEVELOPING A REPORT. TO THE POINT. THAT. OKAY SO CAN WE GO BACK TO L. A. L. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE. ADEQUATE COORDINATION TEAM TO MAXIMIZE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR L. A.'S TO HIRE PERSONNEL. IN NEARLY FROM L. A. L. I THINK THEY WERE JUST HARKEN BACK TO THE INITIAL COMMENTS THAT WE NEED- AND- ASSESSMENT- OUR FINDINGS WAS THAT THERE WERE ARE A FAIR NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THIS INCLUDES THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ESPECIALLY AS FAR AS SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES GO THIS INCLUDES- HEALTH PLANS BOTH PRIVATE AND- MEDICAL OR MEDICARE. AND ALL OUR BACK CAL MOST LIKELY- AND ALSO COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT I THINK THE CHALLENGING THING IS THERE'S NO COORDINATION ACROSS THESE ENTITIES AND SO IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR OT THERE ARE GAPS SERVICE GAPS WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO I THINK THAT IS KIND OF WHY IT AT MOTIVATED OUR RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE A WORKER THAT WHICH TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO. EXAMINING THE ISSUE AND THEN ALSO CHARGING A CROSS AGENCY WORK GROUP WITH RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROVIDE. A CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RATES. THANK YOU MISTER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT- IS NOTED IS HOW MANY ELEAZAR DOES THE ADMINISTRATION TO SPEAK FUNDING WITH THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION INVESTMENT. AND HOW WILL THE ELEAZAR STAYING FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OFTEN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT OF FINANCE IF WE WERE TO STRUCTURE THE GRANT FROM WORK TO THE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP GRANT BECAUSE EXPECTED FINDING IT QUITE ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY PARTNER SET. HOWEVER IT ALSO BELIEVE THE DEPEND ON THE GRANT AWARD AMOUNT AND THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED AS PART OF A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION PROCESS. I NOTED IN THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS- THERE THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE THE ONE TIME AUGMENTATION. AND WHAT THEY NOTE ON THEIR IS TO REQUIRE GRANTS TO BE AWARDED TO UNFUNDED PARTNERSHIP APPLICATION APPLICATIONS WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT. THE PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT NOT OUT WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY PRIORITIES. AND OF COURSE WE WOULD LOOK. IT QUITE FOR THE NHS OF THE PARTNERSHIP PRACTICE AT OUR FEET Y. BUT THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE APPLY FOR THE PAST NINETY MATCH- IN THE L. A. O. SCOTT. THEY TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THE MENTALHEALTH THAT IS NEEDED FOR STUDENTS. IS NEEDED NOW. AND IF YOU BEGIN THIS PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR APPLICATION THE AMOUNT OF TIME IS GOING TO BE SPENT TO TRY TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FINALLY SELECT WHO YOU'RE GOING TO PARTNER WITH. IS NOT GOING TO FULFILL THE NEED FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOW IN THE MAKE IT IN THE MEDIA TIME. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. WE STRUCTURE THE MASS OF THE COMPETITIVE GRANT IN ORDER TO HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH WE COULD A WIDE LIMITED FUNDING THE PROPOSAL THAT BEST MEET THE GOAL OF THE MATCH PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY GIVEN THE CAN'T CURRENT CONDITIONS IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL THAT A WORKOUT AVAILABLE JULY FIRST. AND WILL THERE STILL DON'T DEALING WITH MANY CHALLENGES INCLUDING WILL BE OPENING IN THE SUMMER AND FALL HAVING THAT COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION DEVELOPED AND BEING RELEASED MONTHS LATER WOULD ALLOW. FOR MORE APPLICANTS TO BE READY WITH A PLAN. WHAT ABOUT THE NEED OF THE STUDENTS NOW HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT NOW. AND AGAIN WE STRUCTURE THAT THAT MAC ATTACK BUT IT OF REPLICATION PROCESS BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. CAN OPERATE THE FACT THAT THE FOR THE DIRECT LINE OF POLITICAL ARTICLES AND- ORTING CHRISTMAS I HOPE. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO I'M SORRY MR MMHM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS. ALTHOUGH HOW MANY LEDS IN CALIFORNIA. HOW THE GOVERNOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WOULD DECIDE TWO THOUSAND ALLEYS IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE REQUESTED IS TWELVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF LESS THAN RIGHT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS IN YOUR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DELEGATES. TWO THOUSAND. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT LESS THAN 1% ELLIE AS- THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS IS THAT RIGHT. ALBANY N. DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO THE REACH WOULD DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE PROPOSAL INCLUDING THE BASE LEVEL THE GRANT AWARD OR THE PROCESS ALLOCATE WORK TO COUNTY THE DIFFERENT FIVE MINUTES. I BASED ON THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THOSE DETAILS ARE ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THE GRANT WOULD BE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WELL WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE OF BAD BATMAN AT THE- APPRIVER COMMITTEE. ON. CLARIFYING AND REFINING THE PROPOSAL. AND I PUT BUT I CAN'T FOR WHERE MY- WERE BUT WAS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS ARE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS FROM LA- TO GIVE SMALLER. GRANTS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A GREATER REACH. IS THAT CORRECT ALEJO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASKED WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THE QUESTION WAS ONE OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS THAT- THE GROUNDS V. SMALLER SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A GREATER REACH AND- MORE ELEAZAR. OF MORELIA PARTNERSHIPS. I'M I THINK ONE OF OUR CONCERNS AND WAYS THAT THEIR WIVES NO UPPER LIMIT IN TERMS OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MATCH AND SO FOR INSTANCE IF A COUNTY ALREADY SPENDS. TWENTY MILLION SO YOU HAVE L. A. COUNTY THAT SPENDS TWENTY MILLION ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT- COUNTY WORKS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT PUTS IN A VERY A ROBUST APPLICATION I THINK THE CONCERN WOULD BE THAT THOSE. LARGER DISTRICTS COULD EXHAUST THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION RATHER QUICKLY- I THINK OUR OVERALL RECOMMENDATION WISE TO REJECT THE MATCHING FUNDS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST A FAIR NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF MEETING IF THAT. INTENDED OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU. BYE MY LAST QUESTION A PROBLEM CHAIR- IT MANY IN THE AND MAYBE THE QUESTION IS INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COUNSELORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS. CAN'T WE USE FUNDS LIKE THIS TO INCREASE THE CANCERS THE COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO ON CAMPUSES- IT ESTABLISH STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS WELLNESS CENTERS WOULDN'T THAT BE BETTER. A BETTER WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION IN OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL THE ESTABLISHMENT OR EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING STAFF AVAILABLE FOR IS AS AN OPTION TO USE THE FIND OUT THAT WORK FAMILY HAPPY YOUR OTHER COMPETENCY CONSIDERATION. AS WE CONTINUE WORKING ON A FOOTBALL. THANK YOU. OKAY A SINGLE FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL ISSUE NUMBER FOUR FOUR SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA. HI GOOD EVENING CHEN MEMBERS MICHELLE YEAH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I PLAYED OUT IN THE AGENDA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO PROVIDE ENHANCED SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY RESOURCES. SO UNDER TEN MILLION A MINIMUM OF FIVE MILLION WILL BE A CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY MOST LIKELY A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- TO BAT AND MAKE AVAILABLE SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON. THE TAPE AND ANALYSIS- IN THIS PIECE WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE WE ENVISION THE BULK OF THE WORK THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE WILL BE DOING IS PROVIDING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR DISTRICTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE AND INTERPRET THE DATA THEY ARE GATHERING FROM THE START IT'S- SO THERE ARE MANY FUNDING FOR A MAXIMUM OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WILL BE ALLOCATED AS- MANY GRANTS OR GRANTS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF DECIDED SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS- WE WANT DISTRICTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THESE TOOLS TO HELP INFORM THEIR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS EACH- AND WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE FUNDING WILL ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO ADMINISTER A CLIMATE SURVEY EVERY YEAR AS OPPOSED TO EVERY OTHER YEAR AS IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED- I SPECIALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT TO CREATE A NEW CLIMATE SURVEY OUR TOOL- BUT RATHER TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE. ACCESS AND ARE USING RELIABLE CLIMATE SURVEYS THAT CAN GIVE THEM INSIGHT INTO THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES I'M ESPECIALLY NOW DURING THESE HARD TIMES- AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THE GOAL OF THIS% PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DOING- THE VERY COMPLICATED WORK. OFTHE DISAGGREGATED AND INTERPRETING THE DATA THAT THEY GATHER FROM SURVEYS- TO INFORM THEIR NEXT STEPS IN A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY NEXT PRESENT. THE NATURE MEMBERS MICHAEL AGAIN WITH THE ILLEGAL WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE SOME SIMILAR QUESTIONS THOSE OF A REASON YOU'RE IN GENERAL IN TERMS OF THE VALUE IN THE PROPOSAL WHO WOULD YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER AND CLARIFY HOW THIS PROPOSAL COMPLIMENTS IT DOESN'T DUPLICATE ANY OF THE STATE'S EXISTING OR RELATED TO HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY AND OTHER SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THAT THE STATE PROVIDES TO SCHOOL DISTRICT SIZE ISSUES. THOSE ARE OUR COMMENTS. AND ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I LIKE ON ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN ASSESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS IN THE WAKE OF THE COCA NINETEEN CANTIK AND DISTANCE LEARNING AT THE FBI HAS STATE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR OUR STUDENTS FROM FAMILIES AND ALL OF OUR EDUCATORS BEING AWAY FROM THE CLASSIC BUT BUT THE THING AWAY FROM CLASSROOMS FRIENDS TEACHERS AN EXTRA-CORRECTLY EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES WHILE ADJUSTING TO DISTANCE LEARNING. HAS BEEN A LOT FOR STUDENTS TO DEAL WITH WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS THAT IS WHY NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED SERVICES TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH WE WOULD NOTE THAT CAL SCHOOLS WHICH IS ACTUALLY CAL S. C. H. L. S. AS AN ACRONYM WAS REVISING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR TO SUPPORT SURVEYS ACROSS DIFFERENT SCHOOL SETTING DISTANCE LEARNING IN PERSON AND HYBRID. THE SURVEY QUESTIONS WERE EXPANDED TO ASSESS MORE AREAS RELATED TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH SOCIAL ISOLATION AND STUDENTS EXPERIENCES LEARNING FROM HOME WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT C. E. HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND MAY SERVE AS A BETTER AND TO TEACH A FACILITY THAT'S PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE ONE OPTION IS TO START WITH THE EXISTING SUITE OF SURVEILLANCE CAL SCHOOL. ADMINISTRATOR ADMINISTERED BY FEET THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH WEST DAD WESTEND HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SERVICE CAN BE UPDATED TO ASSESS AND MERGING NEEDS RESULTING FOR THEM FROM THE PANDEMIC WE ESTIMATE THAT A TOTAL COSTS TO ADMINISTER CAL TELL SCHOOLS ANNUALLY IN ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE RELATED TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WOULD BE ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. IF THE PROPOSED TEN MILLION IS USED TO CONTACT WITH THAT AT WEST DAD INSTEAD OF FINDING A COUNTY OFFICE CALIFORNIA COULD COULD SUPPORT SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL ELEAZAR AT NO COST TO ELEAZAR AND PROVIDE TECH AT PROVIDE TRAINING TALLIES IN DATA USE FOR CONTINUOUS SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT FOR THREE YEARS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO DESIGNATED FUNDING FOR TO SUPPORT HEALTH SCHOOLS THE CITY HAS BEEN RELYING ON DISCRETIONARY FUNDS FROM DIFFERENT PROGRAM OFFICES TO FUND THE SURVEY IS A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO APPROPRIATE. SUPPORT TELL SCHOOLS THE TOOL BUT PRODUCE VALUE AT THE- ME THE- THAT ACTUALLY. THE AND REAL SCHOOL DATA THEY'RE ALL USED BY THE- OF. ALLEY A- WOULD MEET THE STATED OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL I HAVE WITH ME BARBARA MURCHISON DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION TO ANSWER ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO NOT- HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOUR SPEAKER BUT MAYBE LOOK FOR L. A. L- I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. YEP QUESTIONER YES IT IS THE BIG PICTURE IS OF COURSE THE DAYS WERE THE OFFSHOOTS OF THE L. C. F. F. IN THE L. CAP PROCESS AND- I KNOW. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS YOU HAD MIXED RESULTS IN. IN AN ENGAGEMENT AND HOW THIS REALLY WORKS ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL SO. JUST JUST WONDERED. IF ANYBODY COULD LIGHTNESS OF HOW. WE'VE EVOLVED AND CHANGE THAT FOR EXAMPLE USES EXAM THIS THIS POINT TWO YEARS AGO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN DAVIS. THEY SENT OUT AN EL CAP FLYER THEY HAD LIKE A BASEBALL CAP ON THERE. THEY'RE RYING TO BE CUTE AND SO PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS LIKE LITTLE LEAGUE SIGN UPS AND IT WAS LIKE IT'S SO. TRYING TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK AND SO. WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT AND HOW ARE WE EVOLVING TO MAKE SURE THE NOTION THIS IS GOOD WE WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY OUT TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HAVE THEM MAKE THEIR DECISIONS- GRAMMAR NOT ALWAYS HAPPY WITH THEM LAST YEAR WE'VE DONE IS THAT- WAS GLORIA OPENINGS BUT- THAT'S THAT'S A PIECE BUT ALSO THESE- EL CAP PROCESS WITH THAT THE SCHOOL CLIMATE DATA AND SO FORTH SO. HOW ARE WE EVOLVING. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY. AND ALICE'S ABOUT THAT- SUGGESTIONS. BASED BESIDES WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL RIGHT HERE. I THINK I KNOW THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT I WOULD NOTE THAT LAST YEAR THE CAL SCHOOLS SURVEYED WAS REVISED FOR TO SUPPORT SURVEYS ACROSS DIFFERENT SCHOOL SETTING- WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S HOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE EVOLUTION I CAN POINT TO THE FACT THAT. WE DO ADOPT THESE SURVEYS AS NEEDED CAN I ASK L. A. L. D. DO YOU THINK THAT THE SURVEYS AND THE PROCESS IS WORKING ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS INTENDED TO WHEN WE- PROVE THAT THIS L. C. F. F. IN A REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I GUESS. YOUR FAVORITE WELCOME IS THERE ON PURPOSE I THINK PART OF THE QUESTION HERE ILLEGALLY. IMPROVE ON THE GOAL OF THE CIRCADIAN WHERE YOU'RE HOPING TO DO WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY OF ONE KIND OF MORE CONSISTENT SET OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD HAVE- SCHOOLMISTRESS DISTRICTS ASK FOR- I THINK IT. WAS GOING ON IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR- IN THE SCHOOL. ON THIS A LOT OF THE TO LOOKING WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE STATE YOU FULLER WITH- BUT THE DOCTORS WE'VE TAKEN THE BOTH THE PAST. AND IN THE- THE- WE USE FOR OUR DISTRICTS YOU CAN. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS CORRECT THAT THE BILL WOULD BE PERCENT DISTRICTS CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO SO YOU'RE NOT A PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH THE BIG SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY DIFFERENT SURVEYS OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO GET. GOING ON. THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE FORWARD LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE STATE LEVEL. FOR TRACKING CHANGES OVER TIME. THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PRIMARY WOULD BE TO IF YOU WANT TO BE AWAY TO GET HELP AND SOME OF THE HOLES OF WHAT'S GOING ON. THE WOULD YOU TAKE A NEW APPROACH TO THE MOST TO. THE CARD. BECAUSE THREE OR DO YOU WANT TO SOMETHING. THAT IS VERY LOCAL AND SPECIFIC TO A COMMUNITY. IN WHICH CASE IT WANT TO BE LOOKING AT MORE DEVELOPING THE- MORNING YOU COULD SPECIFIC. ANSWERING MY BENEFIT CONCERT THAT MANY MORE. IN LINE WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. SURE MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION MORE FOR. OVERSIGHT AND- MAYBE THE STATE AUDITOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I JUST HAVE ONGOING ISSUES AS FAR AS- THE INTENT AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD SO- I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR. SAY NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL HOLD THIS IS. DULCIMER BAIDU'S. I AM WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL CREATE A NEW REQUIREMENT FOR ANNUAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS AND REQUIRE ALLEYS TO USE SPECIFIC SURVEY INTERESTED IN FROM INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE VETTED AND APPROVED. SO TO GET A PERMANENT FINANCE AGAIN- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT CREATE ANY REQUIREMENTS IT WOULD JUST MAKE THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE- TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT. SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS BE CONDUCTED EVERY OTHER YEAR WHAT STILL STANDS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO THAT WOULD STAFF FOR SO THAT WOULD LOCAL SURVEY INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT VETTED APPROVED CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED FOR THE LOCAL. AFTER THE L. CATS A GOAL. SETTING AND MONITORING FOR. A AT ALL THE YES YES. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO IS YOU A KIND SURVEYS THEY- IT HELPFUL AND THE LOCAL NEEDS THEY COULD STILL. GREAT THANK YOU.

PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY SECOND. I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WHAT IS GOVERNOR'S. IS A- COUNTY OFFICE ABOUT. AND DIFFERENTIATED ASSIST. ELIGIBLE GUEST ELIGIBLE DISTRICTS- THE GOVERNOR'S BY. AND SEVENTY TWO POINT FOUR THREE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN BOTH CURRENT YEAR. AND BUDGET YEAR- FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO AT LEAST TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF FOUR POINT SEVEN THREE MILLION AND CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR- COMPARED TO WHAT WAS BUILT INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND IT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE DASHBOARD WAS SUSPENDED IN TWENTY TWENTY SO THE NUMBER OF ELEAZAR IDENTIFIED FOUR DIFFERENT TO GET SYSTEMS WAS HELD CONSTANT- IN TWENTY TWENTY. SB NINETY. AND OTHER TWENTY NINETEEN DASHBOARD IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE ONLY EIGHT SO THAT'S- SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES. THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND THAT'S DOWN FROM TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR THE ELIGIBLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AS YOU NOW FUNDING FOR COUNTY OFFICES IS PROVIDED THROUGH A STATUTORILY DRIVEN FORMULA. AND THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE SIZE OF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY COUNTY THAT ARE ELIGIBLE.
