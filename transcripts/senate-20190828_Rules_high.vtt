00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.598
PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:22.568
TO DESCEND. HI TO ADVANCE THE

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.203
GROUND BREAKING WORK THAT THE

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.405
LEGISLATURE HAS BEGUN. I LOOK

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.841
FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.410
THANK YOU DOCTOR BORN TODAY.

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.212
THANK YOU I WON'T REPEAT

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.447
EVERYTHING MISTER OLSON JUST

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:35.748
SAID THOUGH I AGREE WITH ALL OF

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.684
IT I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.519
AND TO BE CONSIDERED FOR

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.821
POTENTIAL POSITION ON THE I SO

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:44.223
BORED I HAVE STUDIED THE

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.859
CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS FOR

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.361
ABOUT THIRTY YEARS FROM

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.397
GASOLINE TO ELECTRICITY

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:51.864
INCLUDING THROUGH THE

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.600
CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY CRISIS.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.202
AND HAVE WATCH THOSE MARKETS

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.904
EVOLVE AS WE HAVE TURNED TO

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.172
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES AND

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:00.806
NOT WHAT IT IS I THINK A VERY

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.542
EXCITING WAY. CALIFORNIA IS A

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.544
LEADER IN RICH IN REDUCING

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.948
GREENHOUSE GASES WERE MOVING

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.284
VERY QUICKLY TO GREAT MUCH

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.885
LOWER LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:15.321
GASES IN OUR ELECTRICITY SYSTEM

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.456
AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.058
WE'RE CREATING A LOT OF NEW

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.393
KNOWLEDGE THAT IS SPREADING TO

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.661
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.729
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:26.165
IS ONLY 1% OF WORLD GREENHOUSE

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.800
GASES AND SO THE WAY WE'RE

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.302
GOING TO. REALLY SOLVE GLOBAL

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:31.504
CLIMATE CHANGE IS BY EXPORTING

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.673
THAT KNOWLEDGE IN WAYS THAT

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.207
PARTICULARLY THE DEVELOPING

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.877
WORLD CAN USE AND TO IN ORDER

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:40.079
TO ADOPT LOW GREENHOUSE GAS

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.248
TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THEY NEED

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.749
TO GROW BUT THEY NEED TO GROW

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:46.686
ON A MUCH MORE LOW CARBON PATH

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:51.991
THAN WE HAVE GROUND. SO I A

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.326
HAVE WATCH THIS HAPPEN I HAVE

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.327
STUDIED AT AND I HAVE ADVISED

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.895
ON IT OCCASIONALLY BUT I'M VERY

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.463
EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.999
OF ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING AS A

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.067

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.136
SO IS ONE OF IS PROBABLY THE

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.706
MOST INNOVATIVE AND EXCITING

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.674
PART OF THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:11.010
WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. IN PART

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.611
OUT OF NECESSITY THEY HAVE HAD

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:16.115
TO. INNOVATE AND FIGURE OUT HOW

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:18.150
TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK WITH

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.418
HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.687

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.461
AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT CAN

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.629
ALSO BE TRADE WITH OTHER PARTS

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:34.800
OF THE WEST OF CAL AT THE WE

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.101
HAVE BEEN TRADING WITH OTHER

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.504
PARTS OF THE WEST FOR YEARS KID

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.939
THE I SO IN FIVE YEARS AGO

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.575
STARTED AN IMBALANCE MARKET

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:46.278
WHICH IS SMALL STAFF. SOME

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:48.314
TRADING IN THE VERY SHORT TERM

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.349
MARKET THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.886
WELL THE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:57.256
DOWNSIDES PARTICULARLY ABOUT

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.124
BOLSTERING COAL IN OTHER PARTS

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:04.029
OF THE WEST OR LOSS OF CONTROL

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.299
OF OUR SYSTEM DON'T SEEM TO BE

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.868
REALLY BEARING OUT BUT I DON'T

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.072
THINK THAT WE NEED TO RIGHT NOW

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:13.672
SAY WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:16.275
WAY TO FULL REGIONALIZATION THE

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.210
NEXT STEP WHICH DIET SO HAS

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:21.280
BEGUN TO EXPLORE ALWAYS WITH

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.283
WORKING GROUP'S WITH A LOT OF

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.584
STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT ISN'T

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:26.752
IT IT'S A DAY AHEAD MARKET THIS

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.187
WOULD BE A MUCH BIGGER MARKET.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:31.223
THAN THE IMBALANCE MARKET I

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.659
THINK THE SIGNS ARE GOOD THAT

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.160
THAT WAY IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:38.130
WILL PURSUE ONCE WE DO THAT

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.031
WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO THEN

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:40.833
EVALUATE THAT AND SEE HOW IT

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:42.334
YOU SEE HOW THAT'S GOING SO I

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.670
CS MOVING TOWARDS

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:45.637
REGIONALIZATION BUT I DON'T

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:47.172
THINK THERE'S ANY NEED TO SAY

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.141
WE'RE GOING TO DO FULL

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:52.144
REGIONALIZATION AT THIS POINT I

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.713
THINK THAT WE WILL LEARN AS WE

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.815
GO. ON UP I EXPECT THAT WE'LL

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.951
LEARN MOSTLY POSITIVE THINGS

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:01.186
BUT WE WILL HAVE TIME TO

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:03.088
OBSERVE AND SEE IF SOME OF

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.524
THESE CONCERNS ARE BORN OUT A

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.326
SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BUT I

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:12.698
BELIEVE. IN FOLLOWING DATA AND

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:18.704
SO WE'LL SEE LEARN MORE AS. WE

00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:26.278
GO. ANYONE ELSE EVEN IF I A. R.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:26.812
CAN ADD TO THAT AND TALK A

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.148
LITTLE BIT. SO SOON HOUSE

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.449
SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.951
REQUIRED THE I SO TO DO A

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.019
SERIES OF STUDIES OF THE

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.088
BENEFITS. OF REGIONALIZATION OF

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.656
REGIONAL INTEGRATION

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:38.257
INTEGRATING THE THIRTY EIGHT

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:41.260
DIFFERENT BALANCING AREAS IN

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.562
THE WEST. DAD STUDIES THOSE

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:44.530
STUDIES WERE DONE BY

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:45.931
INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS FOUND A

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.032
VERY LARGE SAVINGS MORE THAN

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.801
ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.402
CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS. FROM

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.070
BEING ABLE TO OPERATE

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:57.376
REGIONALLY INSTEAD OF STATE BY

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.010
STATE OF ONE OF THE BENEFITS IS

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:02.581
THE. MANY POWER PLANTS IN OTHER

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:03.882
STATES IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:04.783
STATES COULD BE RETIRED

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.518
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE ALL RIGHT

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.054
NOW HE EVERY BALANCING AREA HAS

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.490
TO MAINTAIN RESERVES IN ITS OWN

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.091
SO WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:16.562
DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE TO.

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:18.363
BE OPERATING POWER PLANTS WHICH

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.968
ARE NOT NEEDED TO MEET THE

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:26.538
NEEDS THE LOAD EVERY DAY SO.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.873
ACTUALLY DOZENS OF THOSE PLANS

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.309
COULD BE IMMEDIATELY RETIRED.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.977
THAT'S ONE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.646
ADEN BUT FOR CALIFORNIA BEING

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:37.049
ABLE TO HAVE READY LOW COST

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.818
ACCESS TO A MUCH LARGER POOL OF

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:43.155
CLEAN RESOURCES. MRS THE

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:47.025
FASTEST AND LEASE COST WAY TO

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:50.596
MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:51.163
THE DONE THAT WAS ONE OF THE

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.802
KEY. HE AIMS HERE. THE NEED FOR

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.570
RESOURCE DIVERSITY I'D I REALLY

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.907
THINK NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED SO

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.476
RIGHT NOW MOST OF OUR LARGE

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.045
SCALE SOLAR PROJECTS ARE IN THE

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:10.215
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.383
WHEN WE HAVE MONSOONAL FLOWS

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.554
WERE PERIODS OF STORMS WE LOSE

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:18.390
AT THE EYES SO WE WE'VE LOST UP

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:21.326
290% OF OUR SOLAR OUTPUT. FROM

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:24.897
OUR OUR DAY TO DAY. SO WE HAVE

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.298
NOW ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.533
MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE SOLAR

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:31.837
PROJECTS. WE HAVE ON SOME DAYS

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:33.405
THIS YEAR AND AT THE END OF

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.540
LAST YEAR WONDER WAS STORMY

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:38.410
WEATHER WE WERE ONLY GETTING

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:39.878
ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS INSTEAD

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:43.382
OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS.

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.150
DAD ARE IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR US

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.451
SO MUCH TODAY BECAUSE WE CAN

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.855
ORDER GAS GENERATION TO WRAP UP

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.024
TO MEET THAT NEED. BUT IF GAS

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.459
IS GOING TO RUN LESS. AND WE

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.129
RELY LESS AND LESS ON GAS

00:19:57.195 --> 00:20:00.432
GENERATION. THEN WE'RE GOING TO

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:02.801
HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SOLAR

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:06.038
RESOURCES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.272
WEST WHICH HAVE DIFFERENT

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.174
WEATHER PATTERNS. SO IF THIRDS

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:12.878
STORMS IN CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:15.681
TO GET SOLAR FROM NEW MEXICO OR

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:18.283
UTAH. OF OR THE EASTERN OREGON.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.618
HE IS GOING TO BECOME MORE AND

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:22.821
MORE IMPORTANT. THE VERY

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.891
SIMILAR STORY WITH WIND WITH ON

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.394
SHORE WIND DURING PERIODS OF

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:31.630
HIGH PRESSURE HEAT WAVES WHICH

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.799
CONSIDER OVER THE STATE FOR A

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:37.936
WEEK OR MORE AT A TIME. THERE

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:38.470
IS NO WIND BECAUSE OF HIGH

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:41.273
PRESSURE EVENTS. SO AGAIN

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.808
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR US NOW

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.210
SO MUCH BECAUSE WE CAN TURN TO

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:48.480
GAS GENERATION. BUT IF WE MEET

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:51.049
THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB ONE

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:51.917
HUNDRED WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:54.953
LESS AND LESS ABILITY TO TURN

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.022
THE GAS FIRED GENERATION SO

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:00.225
THAT REALLY UNDERLINES THE NEED

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:05.564
FOR US TO THINK REGIONALLY.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.565
THERE'S ONE OTHER IMPORTANT

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.967
THING THAT BEARS MENTIONING.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:12.804
HERE ARE HAN. IN SB THREE FIFTY

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.706
WHICH WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:15.607
THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN THE

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.242
WESTERN UNITED STATES HAS

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:21.113
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN TWENTY

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:23.815
SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA WAS THE ONLY

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.851
STATE TO HAVE A 50% RENEWABLE

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:31.757
ENERGY GOAL. NOW THERE ARE SIX

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:34.660
STATES THAT HAVE 1100%

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:37.262
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS AND A

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.965
SEVENTH IDAHO THE STATE HAS

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:41.099
MADE A COMMITMENT BUT THE

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:43.602
UTILITY IDAHO POWER HAS MADE A

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:46.104
COMMITMENT TO. TURN TRANSITION

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.740
TO A 100% OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.476
SO THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.578
CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE BUT WHAT

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:56.214
THAT MEANS ALSO IS THAT NOW WE

00:21:56.281 --> 00:22:00.152
HAVE MANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.219
THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING A WHOLE

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:03.755
LOT MORE WIND AND SOLAR

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:08.427
RESOURCES. SINCE WE ALL WANT TO

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.195
MOVE TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:12.431
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHARE

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.233
OUR RESOURCES AND THAT HE IS

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.436
THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA BEHIND

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.838
INTEGRATING ALL THESE REGIONAL

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:22.174
BOUNCING AREAS TO MAKE IT EASY

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.378
LOW COST WAY. TO SHARE YOUR

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.580
WIND AND SOLAR RESOURCES HYDRO

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:29.881
GEOTHERMAL ACROSS THE STATE

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:33.952
MINES. IS LESLIE ANY FURTHER

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:36.788
COMMENT. I WOULD JUST SAY ON

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.124
THAT I THINK IT'S A TOOL IN THE

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.059
TOOLBOX IN THE THAT THE

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:43.528
QUESTIONS ABOUT REALLY HOW

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:45.063
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.466
CLIMATE GOALS WE SET THE GOAL

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.634
OF 60% RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.770
APPROACHING US IN TWENTY THIRTY

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.805
WE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED 33%

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.007
ON TO THE GRID. SO THE ISSUE IS

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.776
HOW DO WE GO FROM THE THIRTY

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:58.810
THREE TO THE SIXTY WE DIDN'T

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.078
REALLY HAVE A PLAN IN MIND WHEN

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.380
WE ADOPTED THOSE GOALS FOR NOW

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:04.382
WORKING ON THE PLAN SO THAT'S

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.051
WHY I THINK YOU SEE THE SERIES

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.552
OF OPTIONS BEING PRESENTED

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:08.987
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO RULE

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.323
ANYTHING OUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:11.957
HAVE A GOAL YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.859
ACHIEVE BUT TO THAT POINT. I

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:14.693
THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.329
THE LEGISLATURE IT HAS A LOT OF

00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:20.365
CONTROL OVER AND THAT HELP

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:23.301
MITIGATE THE BELLY OF THE DUCK

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:24.770
TO MAKE THE NEXT YOU KNOW NOT

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:27.739
IN A STRANGLED SITUATION AND

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.040
THAT IS THAT LIKE TO ME AND

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.275
RESPONSE TIME OF DAY YOU USE

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.409
THESE ARE ALL WITHIN YOUR

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:40.685
CONTROL. THE. THE

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.287
ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.589
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THESE ARE

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.657
ALL THINGS THAT MITIGATE THE

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.025
BILL IS THE DEATH. OF THESE ARE

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:47.993
WITHIN YOUR CONTROL SO TO THAT.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.094
END I THINK THIS IS A

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:51.263
COLLABORATION THERE WERE IN

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.031
THIS IS A- THIS IS A- A SHARED

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.232
GOAL OF GETTING TO THE 60% GOAL

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:55.534
AND A 100% OVER TWENTY FORTY

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.170
FIVE SO. I WOULD I WOULD I

CALIFORNIANS SIN. REDUCING OUR

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:35.767
CARBON FOOTPRINT I'LL START

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:36.334
WITH THE QUESTION TO MISTER

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:39.504

IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING OUR

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:44.276
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO REDUCING

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.611
OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS IS

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:48.213
YOU KNOW I REPRESENT PART OF MY

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.148
DISTRICT TO SAN LUIS OBISPO

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:51.182
COUNTY WHERE WE'RE DE

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:53.418
COMMISSIONING. DIABLO CANYON

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.553
WHICH CURRENTLY PRODUCES ABOUT

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.790
10% OF P. GENIES ENERGY AND

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:01.459
ABOUT 5% OF THE STATE WIDE GRID.

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:02.594
WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:04.162
EXPLORATION WELL UNDER WAY FOR

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:06.798
OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY MAY BE

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:08.066
USING SOME OF THE EXISTING

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.335
INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST CURIOUS

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:13.605
YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THE ROLE THAT

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:16.808
OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY MIGHT PLAY

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:22.347
THE OPPORTUNITIES THE OBSTACLES.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.915
THANK YOU SENATOR BIDEN I THINK

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.417
OUR OFFSHORE WIND HE HAS A VERY

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:28.053
LARGE AND IMPORTANT ROLE TO

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:29.955
PLAY IN MEETING OUR CLEAN

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:33.325
ENERGY NEEDS. IT'S A TREMENDOUS

00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:36.494
RESOURCE. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:38.930
VIDEO LOGICALLY DOWN THE ON

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:39.998
SHORE WIND RESOURCE WE HAVE IN

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.167
CALIFORNIA. OF MUCH MORE

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:44.002
POWERFUL WINDS THAT BLOW MANY

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:46.304
MORE HOURS OF THE YEAR ARE

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:49.274
GENERALLY NOT AFFECTED BY THE

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.577
HIGH PRESSURE HEAT WAVE EVENTS

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:56.848
THAT WE HAVE OVER LAND. ADEN SO

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:59.484
IT'S A RELATIVELY CLOSE BY AND

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:02.721
AS YOU POINT OUT BECAUSE IT IS

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.323
CAPABLE OF UTILIZING DE

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.959
INTERCONNECTION INFRASTRUCTURE

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.461
SO THE SUBSTATIONS AND THE

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.663
TRANSMISSION LINES THAT DYEABLE

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.165
CANYON POWER PLANT HAS USE. SO

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:16.401
THERE'S A POTENTIAL TO GREATLY

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:19.070
REDUCE THE COST OF OFFSHORE

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.805
WIND BY UTILIZING THAT ALREADY

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:24.509
BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.211
CLINTON THERE'S THERE WOULD BE

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:30.648
I THINK OF VERY STRONG CASE FOR

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:31.916
USING OUR BEST EFFORTS AS A

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:39.457
STATE TO HAVE THIS RESOURCE.

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:45.330
DEVELOPED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:47.265
THE ARE ON THE OBSTACLES RIGHT

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.234
NOW CAR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.069
DEFENSE IS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.937
POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE THAT

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.206
OFFSHORE WIND TOWERS COULD POSE

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.341
TO THEIR OPERATIONS OFF THE

00:27:56.408 --> 00:28:01.713
COAST OF CALIFORNIA. ON THE

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.313
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.248
HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:05.517
NEGOTIATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:09.421
OF DEFENSE SO OF THE CHAIRMAN

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.755
OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION DAVID

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:11.956
HAWKSHAW OLD AND COMMISSIONER

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.758
KAREN DOUGLAS AVENUE LEADING

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:16.194
DETAILED DISCUSSIONS. AND I

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.530
THINK THEY'RE APPROACHING THIS

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:21.366
IN A VERY PROACTIVE WAY YEAH

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:27.238
AND. HI I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:28.940
WILL OF THE GET SOME AGREEMENT

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.542
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:31.943
THAT WILL ALLOW. SOME

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.645
DEVELOPMENT IN SOME OFF SHORE

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.980
AREAS WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:38.316
YET. SO THAT'S THE FIRST UP THE

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.452
SECOND STEP IS THEN THE BUREAU

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:43.288
OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT WILL

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:46.458
HAVE TO ISSUE LEASES. AND THEN

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:47.692
THERE CAN BE COMPETITIVE

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.261
BIDDING OF BY THE WIND

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:51.563
COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:54.766
THOSE LEASES WHEN WE GET TO

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.634
THAT POINT THE I. S. O. WOULD

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:59.304
THEN GET INVOLVED OF BECAUSE

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.473
THOSE OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.040
WILL NEED TO CONNECT TO THE

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.075
CALIFORNIA GRIT. AND THAT'S

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.844
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:12.984
FACILITATE AT THAT POINT. WE

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:13.718
HAVE ALREADY DONE SOME

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:14.586
PRELIMINARY STUDIES THAT WOULD

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:15.920
LOOK AT POTENTIAL FOWS OF

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:18.123
POWER FROM OFFSHORE WIND USING

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:18.957
THE DIAL BELOW CANYON

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:21.659
INFRASTRUCTURE. OF WE WILL DO

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:22.994
MORE DETAILS STUDIES AS THIS

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.396
PROGRESSES BUT I THINK FROM ALL

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:27.565
IN ALL RESOURCE POINT OF VIEW.

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:30.135
THIS IS A VERY VERY POSITIVE

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:32.237

IN IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:11.442
THERE'S WIND ENERGY THAT'S I

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:16.014
THINK SERVING NORTHERN EUROPE

OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY FORWARD.

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.594
ENERGY FUTURE MIGHT MOVE

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.963
FORWARD IN THE INTEREST OF TIME

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.432
I WILL MOVE TO DR. BORENSTEIN

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:35.900
WITH A WITH A DIFFERENT

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:36.935
QUESTION WE SPOKE SOME

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.304
YESTERDAY ABOUT THE- COMMUNITY

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.839
CHOICE AGGREGATION THE CCA'S

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:43.374
THAT ARE SETTING UP REGIONAL

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:47.745
BUYING GROUPS FOR LACK OF A

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:48.780
BETTER DESCRIPTION I'M JUST

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.815
CURIOUS YOUR THOUGHTS ON. HOW

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:53.117
HOW DO THEY FIT IN TO OUR

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.787
ENERGY FUTURE AND THE ROLE OF

00:30:55.853 --> 00:31:00.124
THE BIG ENERGY PRODUCERS VERSUS

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.960
THESE MORE COMMUNITY BASED TO

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.528
REGIONAL BASED. AT LEAST IN

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.563
BUYING UNITS YEAH I THINK THANK

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.465
YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK WE

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.866
NEED TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT CCA'S

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:11.469
DO THEY ARE. IN SOME WAYS A

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.271
LATTER DAY VERSION OF RETAIL

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.540
CHOICE WHICH WE HAD BACK IN THE

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.508
NINETIES AND RESTRUCTURING I

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:19.677
DON'T WANT TO TAR IT IN ANY WAY

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.079
WITH THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.614
CRISIS. WHICH WAS NOT CAUSED BY

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.316
THAT BUT BUT I THINK IT IS. AN

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:28.820
ALTERNATIVE THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:31.322
OFFERED FOR HOW THEY CAN

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.558
CONTRACT FOR THEIR ELECTRICITY.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.361
NOT THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:38.529
ARE DOING ANYTHING PHYSICALLY

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:39.831
TO CARRY ELECTRICITY OR

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:42.133
GENERATE ELECTRICITY THIS IS AN

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.003
ORGANIZATION THAT A CITY CAN

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:46.271
SAY WILL BE OUR PRIMARY OR

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:51.276
DEFAULT. ELECTRICITY PROVIDER.

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:52.243
AS SUCH I THINK IT WOULD THEY

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:58.850
OFFERED EXCITING ALTERNATIVES.

00:31:58.916 --> 00:31:59.384
THEY HAVE GIVEN CITIES THE

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.523
POSSIBILITY OF. DECIDING TO BUY

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.458
HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES.

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.060
AND DIETING TO BUY MORE LOCAL

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:09.694
ENERGY GENERATION IF THEY WANT

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.528
TO. THERE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNS

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:11.896
WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:12.697
ORGANIZATIONS DOING WITH

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.766
OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:17.302
AND SO WHEN WE HAVE CCA'S OR

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.637
RETAIL CHOICE. IT'S VERY

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.673
IMPORTANT TO MAKE CLEAR WHOSE

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.042
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS FOR

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:26.811
INSTANCE TO ACQUIRE RESERVES TO

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:30.581
MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.784
ARE WELL INFORMED ABOUT THEIR

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.486
ALTERNATIVES AND SO FORTH. I

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.555
THINK AND HOW COSTS ARE GONNA

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:39.957
BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:42.427
VARIOUS RETAIL PROVIDERS I

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:45.063
THINK WE HAD SOME BUMPING THIS

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.097
AT THE BEGINNING AROUND THOSE

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.865
ISSUES DATES GETTING SORTED

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:50.568
OUT. MY VIEW AND I HAVE WORKED

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.437
WITH A COUPLE OF THE CCA'S TO

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:55.740
THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVE RETAIL

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.609
RATE STRUCTURES. THAT THEY HAVE

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:01.779
THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:02.914
IN WAYS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.752
MUCH MORE FAST AND EXPERIMENTAL

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.721
THEN YOU'D THEN THE BIG

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.255
UTILITIES COULD DO GOING TO THE

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:14.258
CPSC. SO IN THAT WAY I THINK

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.394
BACK TO THE IDEA OF KNOWLEDGE

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:19.697
CREATION OF HAVING THE SORT OF

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.699
BASTIONS OF EXPERIMENTATION

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.167
WHERE THEY CAN TRY NEW THINGS

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:24.736
WHETHER IT'S VERY HIGH

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:29.273
RENEWABLES. DIFFERENT RETAIL

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.376
RATE STRUCTURE FOR GIVES US

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:34.245
MORE POSSIBILITIES AND I THINK

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.114
HAVE AND I THINK THE CONCERNS

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.948
THAT WERE THERE AT THE

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:39.684
BEGINNING ARE GRADUALLY BEING

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:42.820
WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF.

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:44.188
ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:48.159
BETWEEN THE UTILITIES AND THESE

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:49.861
RETAIL PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:55.266
UTILITIES. ARE STILL IN THE

00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:02.774
POWER PROVIDING STRIP. AT WORK

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.441
AND SO FORTH SO IT'S VERY

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.642
IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:05.910
WHICH ORGANIZATION HAS EACH

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.378
RESPONSIBILITY THANK YOU IN IN

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.914
JUST A TALE ON TO THAT. SO THE

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.416
CCA'S AS YOU INDICATED THEY'RE

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:12.517
NOT PRODUCING THE ENERGY

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.685
THEY'RE NOT CREATING IT THEIR

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:15.853
MARKETING AND MOVE BUT THEY'RE

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.754
RELYING ON THE BIG UTILITIES

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.122
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MOVE IT. CAN

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.590
THE BIG UTILITIES. SURVIVE

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.592
PROVIDING ONLY THAT

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.163
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY'RE NOT.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.397
AT THE SAME TIME MARKETING THE

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:27.532
ENERGY IF I'M FRAMING THAT

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:28.900
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY I A I THINK

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:29.500
THAT THAT IT THERE IS CLEARLY

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.102
THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.137
UTILITIES THAT OUR WIRES

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.807
COMPANIES. AND THAT I'M NOT

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:37.141
CONVINCED THAT'S WHERE WE

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.143
SHOULD GO BUT THERE ARE

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:39.977
EXAMPLES OF THAT AROUND THE

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:43.014
WORLD AND IN A IN WITHIN THE

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.981
UNITED STATES AND THAT IS ONE

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:47.418
POSSIBLE MODEL AND SO I THINK

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:48.753
THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.221
THAT WILL REMAIN ON THE TABLE

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.690
IS A POSSIBILITY. AND

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.592
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CONTINUE

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.727
TO EXPLORE THAT JUST AS WE'RE

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:59.096
GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.632
COMMUNITY RETAILING CCA'S AND

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.201
PROBLEMS AND WE STILL HAVE

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:04.802
CUSTOMERS WHO WERE ON DIRECT

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:07.672
ACCESS OR RETAIL CHOICE THROUGH

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.507
PRIVATE COMPANIES AND I THINK

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.542
THAT. WE COULD END UP WITH THE

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.911
MODEL AND IT'S A PERFECTLY

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:17.348
WORKABLE MODEL WHERE THE WIRES

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.816
COMPANY THE DISTRIBUTION

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:20.585
COMPANY DOES DOESN'T PROCURE

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:22.720
ELECTRICITY FOR ANYBODY THEY

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.555
JUST MAKE THEIR MONEY ON THE

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:27.058
WIRE SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.060
IN LAST BUT NOT LEAST MISS

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.528
LESLIE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.896
LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY TOO AND I

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.764
JUST WANT TO SAY. YOU BRING

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.067
SUCH A VAST EXPERIENCE FROM

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.568
STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:44.141
GOVERNMENT FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:51.282
IN YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH. WHEN

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:53.551
OF WATER AND POWER IN SOUTHERN

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:56.821
CALIFORNIA. AND SINCE YOU COME.

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:58.289
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.258
THE POLITICAL WORLD THEN YOUR

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.225
COLLEAGUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:02.693
REGIONALIZATION. IT SEEMS LIKE

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.528
FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:04.629
THERE ARE GREAT SAVINGS AND

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.030
EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED I

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.265
THINK SOME OF THE CONCERN

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:10.234
WITHIN OUR LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:12.203
EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER IN

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.105
GOVERNANCE IF CALIFORNIA

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:16.307
BECOMES PART OF A LARGER

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:17.842
REGIONAL SYSTEM ANY THOUGHTS

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:20.845
ON. COMMITTING GOVERNANCE

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:23.681
QUESTION OF HOW CALIFORNIA

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:29.854
DOESN'T OF SACRIFICE ITS ITS

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:30.388
ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR OWN

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:34.859
ENERGY FUTURE. I DON'T HAVE A

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.060
SOLUTION BUT I DO UNDERSTAND

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:40.498
THE FEAR ON. MAINLY BECAUSE

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:41.098
LOOK AT THE VALUE OF THE ICE

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.233
THE ICE IS BEEN INCREDIBLY

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.002
VALUABLE TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.637
I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE IT

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.172
UNTIL I GOT I WAS PART OF THIS

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.408
PROCESS TO SELF CRITICAL THE

00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:53.277
ICE WHO IS ON AYE WE DEALT

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:54.111
QUITE A BIT WITH FOR THE

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.012
DEPARTMENT MODERN POWER BECAUSE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.247
OF COURSE WERE REGULATED BY THE

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:58.115
AND THEN WE'RE PERMITTED BY

00:36:58.182 --> 00:37:00.418
THEM SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM.

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:03.120
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO SEE

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:05.423
WHAT WE NEED AS THIS OF ALL

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.525
RIGHT I THINK THE E. I AM THIS

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.493
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET EVEN

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.196
FROM THE DWP PERSPECTIVE IS A

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.965
TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY THE

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.032
DELIVERY PEOPLE AND THAT I

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:18.102
THINK IN TWO YEARS. I THINK

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.337
WITH THE BOARD CREATED WHAT

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.438
WOULD SPLIT DAVE AND OTHERS

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:23.274
CREATED IS REALLY GOING TO HELL

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:26.210
CALIFORNIA HOW BROADER

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:27.545
RELATIONSHIPS AND BRING OTHER

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.547
ENERGY AND OTHER BALANCING

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.416
AUTHORITIES INTO ONE SYSTEM AND

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:33.784
THAT WILL HELP US GET TO THE

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.953
STATE GOALS BECAUSE THERE IS

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.689
SILOS EVEN WITH IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.857
THE E. I AM THIS IS SOLVING

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:42.326
THAT IS PART OF SOLVING THAT SO

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.661
I THINK AS- DOCTOR BORN SEEN

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:44.962
SAID THIS IS AN ERROR TO

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:46.764
PROCESS RIGHT LET'S SEE HOW THE

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.100
I AM BECAUSE WE HAVE EIGHT NINE

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:49.967
MEMBERS NOW. WE'RE GONNA PICK

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.669
UP EIGHT OR NINE MORE IN TWO

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.170
YEARS WE'LL HAVE WE'LL HAVE A

00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:55.973
PRETTY GOOD FEEL FOR A BROAD

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.842
BASED GROUP THIS IS THE REAL

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.277
TIME MARKET WE'RE TRADING IN 5%

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.412
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:04.181
EVOLVING INTO THE EDM WHICH IS

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.117
THE ON THE DAY AHEAD MARKET

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:13.357
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D BE LOOKING.

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:13.891
AT A 100% MARKET OF ENERGY

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:19.730
TRADING. YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.132
I DON'T WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.167
WHAT THE RESPONSE WILL BE AT

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:23.768
THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO THAT BUT

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.670
WE THINK IT COULD BE POSITIVE.

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:26.337
ON WILL HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:29.073
WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE TO US.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.308
RIGHT WING WILL KNOW YOU KNOW

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.009
IF WE SAVE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:32.877
MILLION TODAY. AND A HUNDRED

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:33.577
AND SIXTY MILLION OF THAT HAS

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.378
BEEN TO CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:34.979
YOU CAN JUST THINKING AHEAD

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.514
BECAUSE ONE THING WE DON'T KNOW

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.748
IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.483
OF A 100% RENEWABLE. IT LOOKS

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.484
LIKE YEAH RIGHT RIGHT WELL I

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.285
APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN YEAR.

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.753
DISPLAY OF KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE-

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.521
WE'RE BUILDING THOSE

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.855
RELATIONSHIPS ALREADY. AND I

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.991
THINK IN POLITICS OFTEN IT'S

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.793
BUILDING THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:50.494
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:54.198
LEAP. FORWARD TO INTERESTING.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.867
BROADER RESPONSIBILITY TO A

WERE WE GET STUCK WHILE YOU'RE

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:48.419
BUSY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AN

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:51.255
EVEN BIGGER MORE COMPLEX.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.691
OVERALL HOW WE FIT INTO THIS

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:57.762
AND WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE IN

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:00.231
WATER THE EFFICIENCIES OF SCALE

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:02.433
BY BROADENING. BUT IT AND IN

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.301
THIS MAY BE A SIMPLE QUESTION I

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:06.070
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.239
MISTER OLSON YESTERDAY I DIDN'T

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.406
HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY WITH

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.842
YOU SO TO THIS TO YOU. I WOULD

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:15.146
ASK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:18.449
STATE'S ABILITY WE ALREADY HAVE

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.618
AUTHORIZATION UNDER LAW TO DO

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:23.053
BILATERAL TRANSACTIONS TO BUY

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.458
AND SELL RENEWABLES. HI SO

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.559
REGIONALIZATION IS BIGGER THAN

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.060
THAT GOVERNANCE IS BIGGER THAN

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.696
THAT BUT IF WE ALREADY HAVE THE

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.697
ABILITY TO DO MUCH OF WHAT WE

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.967
NEED TO DO WHY THE PUSH FOR

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:39.904
REGIONALIZATION FROM AYE AYE IS

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.339
SO I IN THE PAST YOU HAVE A

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.407
PREVIOUS GOVERNOR WHO SUPPORTED

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.176
REGIONALIZATION YOU HAVE A

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:47.211
CURRENT GOVERNOR WHO IS DUBIOUS

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.078
OF IT AT LEAST AT ONE POINT

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:51.015
WHEN HE AND I SPOKE. BEFORE HE

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:53.284
WAS SWORN IN SO FROM YOUR

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.552
PERSPECTIVE I HAD A CHANCE TO

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:55.820
TALK TO MISTER OLSEN I'D BE

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.354
APPRECIATIVE TO HEAR YOUR

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.989
THOUGHTS ON THAT EVEN IF I YOU

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.124
MAY HAVE ALREADY COVERED A LOT

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.693
OF IT BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.327
UNDERSTAND IF WE CAN CURRENTLY

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:08.065
DO I WHAT IT IS THE INTENT. WHY

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:13.270
PUSH. FIRST GIVE UP OUR THIRTY.

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:13.871
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:16.073
IS THE IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.143
IS ONLY 5% IS MISS LESLEE SAID

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.178
WHAT WERE MOVING TOWARDS IS THE

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:23.447
DAY HAD MARKET WHICH IS WHERE

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.682
ESSENTIALLY THE REST OF THE

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:27.785
POWER ULTIMATELY IS TRANSACTED

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:31.055
OKAY BUT THE BUT THE

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:31.622
DISTINCTION LET ME AND I'M

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:33.257
SORRY LET ME I'M TRYING TO

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.259
FOLLOW. THAT'S THE DISTINCTION

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.627
NO NO THAT'S THE DISTINCTION

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:37.862
BETWEEN THE IMBALANCE MARKET IN

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:40.297
THE DAY I HAD BOTH OF THOSE CAN

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:42.666
BE DONE WITHOUT A REGIONAL

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:45.202
SYSTEM OPERATOR WHAT CANNOT BE

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:46.804
DONE WITHOUT A REGIONAL SYSTEM

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.205
OPERATOR IS TRANSMISSION

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:49.573
PLANNING INTEGRATED

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.342
TRANSMISSION PLANNING SO IF YOU

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:53.344
REALLY GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.546
THAT IS DISPATCHED EFFICIENTLY

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.114
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.216
ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE TO

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.351
MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.253
TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. TO MOVE

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.955
THE SOLAR POWER IN THE EARLY

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:07.224
AFTERNOON WHEN THE SUN IS

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.659
SETTING IN NEW MEXICO INTO

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.327
CALIFORNIA ARE THE OTHER WAY

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.695
AROUND FROM CALIFORNIA TO

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:14.265
MEXICO AND IN THE MORNING WHEN

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.766
THE SUN IS COMING UP IN NEW

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:18.369
MEXICO INTO CALIFORNIA SO

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:19.536
HAVING THAT SORT OF

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:22.573
TRANSMISSION PLANNING ALLOWS US

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.475
TO NOT JUST DISPATCHED DAY TO

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:27.144
DAY MORE EFFICIENTLY BUT TO

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.213
ACTUALLY BUILD AN ENTIRE SYSTEM

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.614
THAT'S INTEGRATED THAT ALLOWS

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:33.450
US TO. LOWER THE COST OF

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:35.586
INTEGRATING THESE INTERMITTENT

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.022
RENEWABLES SO I THINK WE ARE

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.490
GOING TO GET A LOT FROM THE DAY

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:40.758
HAD MARKET I THINK WHAT WE'VE

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:42.226
GOTTEN SO FAR FROM JUST THE

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.394
IMBALANCE MARKET IS A VERY TINY

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.463
PIECE BUT ULTIMATELY IF WE'RE

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.598
REALLY GOING TO HAVE AN

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.633
EFFICIENT OPERATION WHERE WE

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.236
USE A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:54.538
INTERMITTENT RESOURCES THERE

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.540
ARE GOING TO BE BIG ADVANTAGES

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.842
TO REGIONALIZATION. NOW THERE

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.679
ARE POTENTIAL CONCERNS TO AND I

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:02.980
THINK WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.416
MONITORING THAT TO MAKE SURE

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.650
THAT THE BENEFITS ARE LARGE

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:12.256
ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY CONCERNS.

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:12.890
AND YOUR CONCERNS WOULD BE WELL

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:18.295
ONE OF THE CONCERNS HAS. AND

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.363
THAT THIS IS GOING TO KEEP COAL

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.698
PLANTS OPERATING LONGER AND I

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.231
THINK THE EVIDENCE SO FAR

00:43:21.298 --> 00:43:21.865
DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT BUT IT'S

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:22.366
SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.001
CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THERE ARE

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:27.271
LEGAL CONCERNS ALTHOUGH I WILL

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:27.871
CONFESS I AM NOT AN EXPERT AT

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:31.642
THAT. THANK YOU AND MISTER

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:33.477
OLSON SHARED THAT. ANYTHING YOU

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.679
WANT TO ADD I WAS GONNA SAY I

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.181
DON'T THINK REGIONALIZATION

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:39.316
UNTO ITSELF IS THE GOAL YOU

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:41.218
KNOW I THINK IT'S WHAT I SAID

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.853
BEFORE I THINK IT'S A TOOL YOU

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.022
KNOW I THINK THE- I THINK WHAT

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.223
WE'VE DONE SO FAR MAKES SENSE

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.424
WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:49.326
INCORPORATE 33% RENEWABLES ONTO

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:51.729
THE GRID. SO FAR. I THINK IT

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:54.064
WAS WISE TO PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.300
WAYS TO APPROACH THIS WITH THE

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.868
I AM I THINK THE I AM GOING TO

00:43:57.935 --> 00:43:59.536
PROVE VERY BENEFICIAL. AS SEVEN

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:01.105
JUST SAID YOU YOU CAN ADD THE

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.573
EDM WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:05.642
ON. THE STRUCTURE OR THE

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.644
AUTHORITY OF THE KING OF THE

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.046
CALIFORNIA ON THE GOVERNANCE

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:10.381
ISSUE I DON'T REALLY THINK WE

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:12.916
NEED TO DO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.418
AT THIS POINT I THINK THERE'S A

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.053
LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU MIGHT

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.121
CONSIDER DOING A DEMAND

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.789
RESPONSE. YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:19.757
THESE OTHER THINGS WITHIN OUR

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:22.026
CONTROL BECAUSE WHY ARE WE

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.427
DOING THIS AT ALL WE'RE TRYING

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:27.498
TO MITIGATE. THE PEAK THE PEAK

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:31.235
ON A TIMES ON THE ON THE GRID

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.603
WE WANT TO MAINTAIN GRID

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:34.171
RELIABILITY THE THING THAT

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.572
THREATENS GRID RELIABILITY IS

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.674
THAT STEEP RAMP THIS HAPPENING

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.777
BETWEEN. FIVE AND NINE SO

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:45.082
THAT'S. WHAT THAT'S THE CONCERN

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:45.649
YOU'RE HEARING HERE IS ABOUT

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:50.621
THAT RIA. IF I CAN JUST ADD ONE

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:51.855
OTHER THING. THE BOTH THE I AM

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:52.823
AND DAY HAD ENERGY DEAD MARKET

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:53.657
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:54.258
VOLUNTARY AND THE REST OF THE

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.726
WEST AND- THERE ARE ENTITIES

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:57.594
THAT ARE ABLE TO SORT OF STEP

00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.664
IN AND STEP OUT. DAY BY DAY. ON

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:03.901
RTO IS ON ALL IN SO IT REALLY

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.837
IS PLANNING JOINT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:07.938
DURING TRANSMISSION PLANNING

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.908
JOINTLY. AND WE ARE DISPATCHING

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:13.644
THE SYSTEM. SO I THINK.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.479
ULTIMATELY TO GET THE MOST OUT

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.948
OF THIS. HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:19.817
WE DO HAVE COMMITMENT BY ALL

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.319
THE PLAYERS WOULD BE MORE

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:23.253
VALUABLE THERE'S A QUESTION OF

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.389
HOW MUCH MORE VALUABLE. THANK

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.558

AND KIND OF AN APPROACH. OF

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.907
MOVING FORWARD THAT THAT GIVES

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:46.810
US SOME WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS.

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:48.445
