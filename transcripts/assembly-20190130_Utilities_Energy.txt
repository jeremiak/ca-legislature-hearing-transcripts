ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY THIS IS OUR ANNUAL OVERSIGHT HEARING -- FOR ANY REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCACY OFFICER OFFICE. WE ARE HAVING A HEARING SO WE'RE GOING TO WELCOME MEMBERS AS THEY AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY -- HERE -- WE WON'T HAVE ROLL CALL BUT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OR OF OUR COMMITTEE PRESIDENT -- I'D LIKE -- TO WELCOME BACK THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE AND RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE OBVIOUSLY HAD A LOT OF ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE THAT. REVOLVE AROUND OF THE IMPORTANCE. OF RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS A COMMITTEE. AT ALSO -- EVEN THOUGH SHE IS NOT HERE JUST YET WE HAVE. ONE NEW MEMBER -- WHO WILL BE JOINING OUR COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY CARILLO? OF FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HER PARTICIPATION -- WE ALSO WELCOME BACK ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHO. WERE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE HAVE ALSO THE WE'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH TWO NEW PEN MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF -- THAT HAVE JOINED US THIS YEAR OF SOME OF YOU I THINK WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH. EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEES OFFICE TO INTRODUCE MY YOU ALREADY KNOW MERRY. US LAST YEAR SHE WAS WITH THE CALIFORNIA. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN. A UTILITY ENERGY WORLD FOR MANY YEARS -- WE'RE ALSO SO WELCOME MERRY -- WE ALSO JOINED BY HIM AS TAYLOR WHO IS OUR COMMITTEE ASSISTANT. AND AND AS HAS BEEN A PART OF THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS AND SHE JOINS US AND WE ARE SO. PROUD TO HAVE HER BE A PART OF THIS TEAM A KELLY SMITH. WILL BE CONTINUING. TO BE A PART OF OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AS A RETIRED ANNUITANTS SO THERE'S A LITTLE DOWNTIME BEFORE WILL. A C. KELLY BACK WHICH WILL BE A PART OF OUR EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. I CERTAINLY. OF FIND THIS APPROPRIATE -- THAT WE START THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION BY HOLDING THIS ANNUAL OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE CPUC. AND THE OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC. WE ENDED LAST SEASON THEIR LAST SESSION. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WILDFIRE. PROTECTION ACT SB NINE A ONE THAT MEASURE SET IN MOTION A SERIES OF CRITICAL ACTIONS. THAT THE CPUC HAS BEEN MANDATED TO UNDERTAKE. TRAGICALLY. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THAT LEGISLATION A DEVASTATING AND DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRE CONSUME THE TOWN A PARADISE. AND OTHER NEARBY COMMUNITIES LEAVING A PATH OF DEATH. AND DESTRUCTION. THIS HEARING PRESENTS OUR FIRST FORMAL OPPORTUNITY HERE FROM THE CPUC ABOUT HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF THE WALL FIRE PROTECTION ACT SB NINE A ONE THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE CBC. THERE ARE NEARLY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN HIGH RISK FIRE RISK AREAS WHICH MAKES UP 44% OF CALIFORNIA'S LAND MASS. THERE ARE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSING UNITS WITHIN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. FURTHER IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FOUR POINT TWO MILLION WOODEN POLE UTILITY POLES. AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD ELECTRIC LINES CROSSING THROUGH THESE EXPANDING HIGH FIRE. HAZARD AREAS. ARE SERVING GROWING POPULATIONS. THIS INSTITUTION RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE PRESENTS [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S INGENUITY AND TO NASA THE WILL SERVICE WELL AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO HARDEN AND INNOVATE OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. COULD WITHSTAND THE PERILS OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGING. AS YOU KNOW YESTERDAY PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC FORMALLY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER. ELEVEN THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS NOT P. JEANNIE RECENT BANKRUPTCY FILING [inaudible] HOWEVER. I WOULD ASK THAT. IN PRESIDENT PICKERS PRESENTATION -- THAT THERE BE ADDRESSING OF THE COMMISSION'S ROLE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS IN THE PROCESS. I'M ALSO SURE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THE IMPORTANCE AND MAINTAINING THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OF THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STABILITY OF RATES AND THE ONGOING ADMINISTRATION OF OUR PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE VICTIMS OF THESE TRAGIC FIRES DO NOT AGAIN BECOME VICTIMS AND THE CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCESS. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE. THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN SB NINE A ONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN CONCERT. WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE AS THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS UNFOLDS. NOW IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO A WELCOME MICHAEL PICKER PRESIDENT OF CPUC. AND HIS TEAM IF HE LIKE TO BRING THE FOUR TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE. A LET ME JUST ALSO SAY THAT THE THE A COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF PRESS PRESIDENT PICKER -- AS HE CONCLUDES HIS PRESENTATION. AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY ELIZABETH ACKLES DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ADVOCATES. WHO WILL PROVIDE HER BRIEF PRESENT VERSION? OF THE CPUC PRESENTATION. OF THEN WE WILL AT THE CONCLUSION OF MEMBERS -- QUESTIONS WILL TURN TO THE PUBLIC -- TO RECEIVE QUESTIONS OR RECEIVE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. AGAIN -- PRESENT PICKER WE THANK YOU. FOR JOINING US AS YOU ALWAYS DO IT IS ANNUAL REVIEWS -- WE SPECIALLY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY IN THE HOW THE PC IS LOOKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF NINE A ONE THANK YOU. WHICH WHEN. CONTROL YEAH YEAH WITH A PARTIAL. HOUSES BETTER -- I MICHAEL PICKER AND WITH ME TODAY IS OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALICE EVON SHE WAS BRAND NEW LAST YEAR WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU AND THE OUR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT DIRECTOR LISA VEDA MALASHENKO AND THE ED RANDOLPH WHO'S ARE GONNA ENERGY DIVISION DIRECTOR. SO AS WE GET INTO QUESTIONS AND AND YOU HAVE THE NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO CAN ANSWER MORE CLEARLY OR IN MORE DETAIL QUESTIONS THE YOU HAVE THEN I CAN. THEIR HERE. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE ONE AND I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT UTILITY BANKRUPTCIES. BUT BEAR WITH ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE THIS IS THE DAY THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO YOU THAT I HAVE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE IN CLEAN ENERGY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC BASICALLY SERVED ALL ABOUT 33% OF THE ELECTRICITY TO THEIR CUSTOMER FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. ARE IN TWENTY TWENTY WE PROJECT THAT THAT AMOUNT WILL BE ABOUT COMING FROM. RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WAS SET AT 28% BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY SHOULD BE AT 40%. ESTY JEANNIE SANDY -- GAS ELECTRIC IS CURRENT WITH INTO THE IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY'LL BE AT FORTY FIVE PLUS SOME CHANGE PERCENT. THIS IS ALL IN ADVANCE OF THE STATUTORY EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD BE AT 33%. THE ARE THESE CONTRACTS IS FOR FOR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROJECTS THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY -- PROJECTS -- THE PRICES FELL ABOUT NINE POINT EACH YEAR BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THIS KIND OF BALL PORTRAIT PURCHASING WOULD ACTUALLY HELP TO DRIVE DOWN PRICES IN THE MARKET AND GAIN EFFICIENCIES IN COMPETITION WITHIN THE FIELD. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AVERAGE PRICE ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO IN CALIFORNIA WAS FOUR POINT SEVEN CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR THAT'S COMPETITIVE WITH THE NEW NATURAL GAS PLANT. A VERY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH MOST OTHER -- KIND OF CONVENTIONAL GENERATION. SOME UNVERIFIED REPORTS THAT ARE IN THE SOUTH WEST OF TO CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR DESERT SOLAR AND FOUR CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR FOR FOR SOLAR PLACE BATTERIES THAT COMES FROM OUR ARE THE COULD EVERYTHING KEPT FOR THE LAST THE THE UNVERIFIED REPORTS COMES FOR OUR ANNUAL. RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD REPORT WHICH WAS DELIVERED. LAST OCTOBER TO THE LEGISLATURE SO. SOME THINGS ARE WORKING VERY WELL -- I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE HEART THEY WERE ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKING PROGRESS ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT. I THINK IT WILL BE ABLE TO HIT THE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS FOR CLEAN ELECTRICITY IN IN SB ONE HUNDRED WHICH ADOPTED LAST YEAR. HANDILY 60% IF WE'RE AT THESE LEVELS NOW AND AT A GOOD PRICE THE CHALLENGE WILL BE. MEETING YOUR CARBON Ã¡UCTION GOAL SINCE WE GOT 2100% RENEWABLES AND STILL MESS ARE TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY CARBON WILL ALSO COME BACK TO THAT IN A BIT. SO A LOT OF MAJOR FOCUS INTERNALLY TRYING TO BUILD THE BUSINESS SYSTEMS THAT THE CPUC NEEDS TO SUPPORT EVER OTHER EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE -- WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ENGAGING IN A LOT OF INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING -- WE HAVE STRONGER BUSINESS SERVICES BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO LIKE ALL OTHER STATE AGENCIES WE HAVE A LOT CHALLENGES AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW THINGS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY -- WE'RE WORKING WITH CAL I. T. AND WE HAVE A NEW I. T. DIRECTOR TO SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY FRESH AND HAS EXPERIENCE ELSEWHERE WITH MODERNIZING THEIR SYSTEMS. A AND WE HAVE NEW INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS. TO THE RECENT HIRING OF JENNY ALLEN IN ASUNCION FROM -- FROM A ONE OF THE STATE'S HEALTH AGENCIES WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AN INTERNAL AUDITING BRINGING NEW RIGOR. I THINK THAT THAT WAS -- US A TREMENDOUS STEP FORWARD BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE WORKING IN STATE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. UP PROGRESS IN RESOLVING OUR OUR PROCEEDINGS WITHIN THE TIME LINES THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED FOR US WE LAST YEAR WE RESOLVED TWO HUNDRED NINE PROCEEDINGS IN WITHIN THE TIME LIMITS THAT THAT WE ARE SO EXPECTED TO REACH. THIRTY THREE OF THEM ARE RESOLVED WITH EXTENSIONS RANGING FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS MOST OF THOSE WERE TO ACCOMMODATE A SETTLING PARTIES OR TO DEAL WITH SOME CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THAT THAT THE PARTIES ARE STUCK ON NONE OF THESE. WERE RESOLVED LATE -- TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX ARE STILL UNDER WAY WE HAVE ABOUT -- ABOUT. SIX HUNDRED THE PROCEEDINGS A YEAR THAT WE DEAL WITH -- THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION WHICH IS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY FOR THE LARGE ENERGY AGENCIES OF THEIR GENERAL RATE CASES. THERE IS ACTUALLY REQUEST FROM SOME OF THE PARTIES AND FROM SOME OF THE UTILITIES THAT RATHER THAN DO THIS ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING BASIS WE GO TO A FOUR YEAR BASIS. SO WE JUST WANT TO SIGNALED THAT THERE'S NOT ONLY AN EXPECTATION THAT THIS IS BECOMING MORE COMPLEX GOING TO TAKE MORE. TIME ON OUR PART BUT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE COME BEFORE US AND ARE HIGHLY LEGALISTIC LITIGATED PROCEEDINGS ARE ASKING FOR MORE TIME. I'LL POINT TO SOMETHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE OVERLAPPING AUTHORITY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO IN ORDER TO REALLY ACCOMPLISH THE STATE'S GOALS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO ARE EXAMPLES ARE. WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU A MEMBER AND OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. WE HAVE FOCUSED A LOT TOGETHER HOW DO YOU DE ENERGIZE WHOLE SEGMENTS OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM IN HIGH RISK AREAS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE. WHEN AT THE SAME TIME YOUR SOMETIMES CUTTING SERVICES TO THOSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHO NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO PUMP WATER OR FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- IT'S OF ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED. WE KNOW THAT IT CAN HELP TO REDUCE RISK BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT CREATES A DIFFERENT KIND OF RISK. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH CAL FIRE GOING BACK TO THEIR FIRE -- FUEL HAZARD MAPS -- WHICH THE THEY PRODUCED FOR US IN THE NEW VEGETATION STANDARDS WHICH ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WHERE WE ACTUALLY RATHER THAN HIRING MORE STAFF TO DEAL WITH LAND USE PERMITTING AND AND CALIFORNIA OF OUR MIDDLE QUALITY ACT PROCEEDINGS. WE HAVE USED THEIR STAFF HAS THE AMOUNTS OF PERMITTING THAT THEY DO GOES DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ACTUALLY. IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHO ARE JUST VERY RECENTLY WE COMPLETED A NEW MEMBER OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL RECYCLES ON WHAT DO YOU DO WITH BATTERIES AND? AND SOLAR PANELS AT THEIR END OF LIFE AS WE AS WE START TO SEE A LOT OF THE OLD PEAVY PANELS AGING. THEY'RE GONNA GO SOMEWHERE WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE THEM CAN BE RE MANUFACTURE. A SIMILARLY WITH BATTERIES OR HAS NOT BEEN A LOT OF STUDY WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE THE KIND OF PROBLEM THAT WE SAW WITH CATHODE RAY TUBES. WERE THE ONLY PLAN THAT TH STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD WAS SHIPPED TO CHINA. BECAUSE THE CHINESE ARE NOT TAKING THEM ANYMORE STATE WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS. AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR TO REGULARLY MEET TO MONITOR AND PLANNED FOR RELIABLE ELECTRICITY AND GAS SERVICE WE RECENTLY HAD ACE A HEARING AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. TO TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF BRINGING A SEE AN FOR HOME HEATING AND COOKING AND FOR BUSINESS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT GAS LINES GOING OUT OF SERVICE AND THE THE REDUCED. CAPACITY AT THE LEASE OKAY ANY GAS STORAGE FACILITIES. NUMBER OF NEW POLICY INITIATIVES WE APPROACH THIS YEAR INCLUDE -- SOMETHING ON BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION IS CALLED FOR IN SB THREE FIFTY AN SP FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND IN THE INTERVIEW COMMISSION'S NET ZERO BUILDING STANDARD. OF IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TO GET TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS WE CAN'T JUST DO WITH CLEAN ELECTRICITY WE HAVE TO USE REDUCE THE USE OF GAS. IN IN IN EXCEPT IN THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS SIMILARLY WE HAVE TO LOOK TO USE OF CLEAN ELECTRIC FUEL'S AS A AS AS A PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE DID STANDARDS ON DISCONNECTION IT SHOULD BE WE SET STANDARDS FOR DISCONNECTION AND AFFORDABILITY IT WERE -- WE DEVELOPED A BUNCH OF CRITERIA WERE FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY THEM AS WE START TO SEE SOME OF THE THE NEW CHANGES IN EXPENDITURES THAT UTILITIES HAVE MADE AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE WILL SEE THOSE COSTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HURT RATE PAYERS IT DOESN'T SHOCK THEM THAT WOULD THERE'S THERE THERE'S A SMOOTH SCALE UP TO PAY FOR THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IT'S NOT ALL BAD WE KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS THE EXPENDITURES THAT WE'VE MADE IN CALIFORNIA ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY. HAVE ACTUALLY REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT PEOPLE USE SO THE EVEN WHILE OUR ELECTRICITY RATES GROW. AND ARE IN THE TOP QUADRANT NATURALLY. OUR ELECTRIC BILLS ARE IN THE LOWEST QUADRANT NATIONALLY. AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S PROVEN TO BE A WISE STRATEGY AND WE THINK THAT WE CAN WORK AROUND THE AFFORDABILITY ON ON ON SOME OF THESE OTHER EXPENDITURES. ARE AT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US IT'S FOR MORE BATTERY STORAGE TO OUR SMALL GENERATOR INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE'RE STARTING TO WORK ON THAT. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF OF OF OF ACTING ON THE REQUEST OF OF ONE OF THE UTILITIES AND CLOSURE OF THE X. TO MEET P. JEANNIE ON THE CLOSURE OF DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S REQUIREMENT THAT WE ACTUALLY FIND A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT NEED SUPPORT AS A RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THE EMPLOYMENT IN THE TAX REVENUE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION WE POINT WE WE DID -- FOURTEEN PILOTS. THAT. THAT WILL ACTUALLY BRING MORE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION A LOT OF THAT'S FOCUSED ON FLEETS AND PARTICULARLY AROUND THE PORTS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS WE MOVE INTO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVING. THE ABILITY TO HAVE FLEET MANAGERS WHO CAN LEARN TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST USE THESE HOW IT FITS INTO THE GRAD CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT. AND THE ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES REALLY VALUABLE IT HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF REDUCING AIR POLLUTION. IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED BECAUSE OF DIESEL TRUCK. AND SO IT IT HAS THAT KIND OF BENEFIT IN GREENHOUSE GAS AS WELL SOME BONA OVERALL BENEFIT TO THE LANDLOCKED PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY. I WANTED POINT TERROR -- THE OUR ON GOING -- UTILITY DIVERSITY CONTRACTING PROGRAM WHICH RECALL PASSED THE UTILITIES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS TO DIRECT SOME OF THEIR CONTRACTING TO SMALL BUSINESSES DEBATE DISABLED FAT AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. DATE OF AN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITY. THIS YEAR LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER WHEN WE HAD OUR ANNUAL REPORT WE CAN IDENTIFY TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF CONTRACTING AND SUBCONTRACTING FROM CALIFORNIA UTILITIES. THAT DID NOT GO OUT OF THE STATE IT'S STATING COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE A HARD TIME DEALING WITH LARGE CORPORATIONS. IT'S BECOME A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM THE THE BLADE OF THE LARGE UTILITIES EMBRACE IT. WE FIND THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PARTICIPATION IS DOWN. BUT OVERALL THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW THAT TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE LEAK OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO NATIONAL CONTRACTORS. BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AND CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR STATE. WE ARE ALSO WRESTLING WITH THE CHALLENGE OF FIVE THAT ANNA TALK ABOUT NEXT OF THESE THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY. WHO DON'T REALLY FIT AS REGULATED ENTITIES ARE NOT PARTICIPATING AND THEY ARE SHRINKING THE AMOUNT? OF DOLLARS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GOING TO THAT PROGRAM. I'M REALLY I'M GONNA COME. TO SOME OF THE MORE TOPICAL ISSUES IT PROBABLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE AND DONE IN THE RECENT ACTIONS BY NEED TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY BUT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT THREE TRENDS THAT ARE. IN THE BACKGROUND THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN BY JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT [inaudible] SO ARE. FIRST IS THAT. PARTICULARLY IN THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY BUT A LITTLE BIT IN THE GAS INDUSTRY WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF FUN REGULATED PARTICIPANTS IN MARKETS THEY ACTUALLY BY ELECRICITY OR THE BY NATURAL% GAS AND SERVE IT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH HEARING CALIFORNIA. SO A A AN EXAMPLE OF THAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS TO SELL TO COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. CAN BEAT THE UTILITY PRICE THEY BASICALLY PAY A FEE TO WE'LL ELECTRICITY OVER THE WIRES TO CUSTOMERS. BUT AS THE UTILITIES LOSE. CUSTOMERS EITHER FROM THE THE CLEAN COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS. THE THE THE CCA'S OR IN THE GAS INDUSTRY THROUGH THE CONTRACT AGENTS. THEY THOSE UTILITIES HAVE A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR BEING COMPENSATED THIS BASED ON THEIR SALES SO I'LL COME BACK TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE HERE. IT IT IT WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. IN IN IN IN THESE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE RESHAPING THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE -- THE LARGEST GROWING SECTOR FOR PURCHASES OF OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND I SUSPECT HEARING CALIFORNIA. IS CORPORATE PURCHASES DIRECTLY OF THEIR OWN GENERATORS AND THEY PAY A FEE TO WE'LL THEIR ELECTRICITY TO THEIR FACILITIES OVER THE WIRES. THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY AS MUCH AS FIVE GIGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. THERE IS. THE ABILITY FOR FOR SOME COMPANIES USE NATURAL GAS FUEL CELLS AS A WAY THAT THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR RELIABILITY SO THE OLD NOTION THAT EVERYBODY IS SEEKING CHEAP. IS ACTUALLY BEING TURNED ON ITS HEAD BY THESE TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FOR HOME ELECTRIC RELIABILITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OVER PRICE. ARE PAYING AND BUYING THEIR OWN SOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL RELIABILITY -- WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF OF CHANGE IN THESE INDUSTRIES AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THE DOCUMENTS THAT LEAD UP TO THE RECENT -- ARE PROBLEMS OF P. JEANNIE PEOPLE POINT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS AS BEING ONE OF THE STRESSES. THAT ACTUALLY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE UNDERGOING. I WORRY FAR MORE ABOUT SOME OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE COULD FACE THIS IS IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION WE FOUND OURSELVES IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE WAY AND A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITY HAD GONE INTO THE HANDS OF THESE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. NOT ALL OF THEM WERE READY FOR OR WHAT CAN BE FEROCIOUS AND VOLATILE ACTRESS CITY MARKETS SOME OF THEM FAILED. AND THAT ENDED UP WITH PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW AS BLACKOUTS. I DON'T THINK WERE THERE BUT IF WE DON'T BEGIN TO PLAN FOR WE COULD EASILY DRIFT INTO THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. SIR WE PRODUCED THIS REPORT. AND HAD HEARING THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS A LOT OF RESEARCH. ON A PUBLIC WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND WE STUDIED STE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DEREGULATED THEIR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO SEE HOW THEY DID IT WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS THEY FACED. AT THE END OF THAT WE TOOK ALL THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT FOLKS WHO CAME BEFORE US RATE PAYER ADVOCATES RENEWABLES DEVELOPERS ON THE ROOFTOP SOLAR DEVELOPERS BATTERY -- WHOLE RANGE OF OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. AND WE PUT IT TOGETHER IN THIS GAPS ANALYSIS WHICH WERE PROVIDING TO YOU TODAY I HAVE TWO COPIES YEARS IS COMBINED IN ONE SINGLE SOURCE. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BIG THINK THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE OF THE SMALL PARTIES FAILS. WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T ALWAYS MEET ALL OF THE LECTURE CITY SUPPLY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WITHIN THEIR PARTICULAR SERVICE AREA. BECAUSE OF GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS OR THE NEED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUY FOR THOSE REALLY HOT DAYS WE CALL THAT RESOURCE ADEQUACY THAT'S PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THREE EIGHTY THAT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET. LAST YEAR WE ISSUED ELEVEN WAIVERS TO THE SMALLER PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T. AT GETTING ACCESS. TO THAT RESOURCE ADEQUACY. AND THAT TO ME IS A WARNING SIGN THAT WE COULD BE A PROBLEM IN TROUBLE WERE WRESTLING WITH THAT INTERNALLY. WE THINK THERE MAY BE SOLUTIONS BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE THOSE WAIVERS BECAUSE OF SINGLES PROBLEMS FOR TO FOR ME. WE TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU PROVIDE HOW DO YOU CREATE A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR CUSTOMERS IN CASE EVERYTHING ELSE GO SOUTH. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT UTILITIES ARE COMPENSATED FOR THOSE THINGS THAT THEY WILL REMAIN DOING THEY DON'T OWN GENERATION THEY'RE ALL CONTRACTING FOR ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT. TOO BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THE WIRES THE POLLS THE METERS THE OPERATIONS WITHOUT THAT. PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO GO TO THEIR OWN -- PROVIDER WITH CARRY THEIR ELECTRONS HOME. SO IT JUST DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT THAT -- SO I'LL JUST COMMAND THIS REPORT TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO US IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GAMING HERE WE ALREADY KNOW OF PROBLEMS IN ROOFTOP SOLAR IN -- IN PACE LOANS AND IN THE THE GAS AGENTS WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CRAMMING AND SLAMMING OR OTHERWISE CHEATING CUSTOMERS WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THEM. IT MAY BE TIME TO DO THAT TO WE WANTED TO STRESS TEST FOR ALL THESE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SO WE HAVE SOME SENSE. OF THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES DO WE NEED BETTER DISCLOSURE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING FROM THEIR THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE ELECTRICITY IS A CLEAN IS IT NOT CLEAN. AIR THE BUYING FROM SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTUALLY SELLING THEM THEY'RE CLEAN ELECTRICITY BUT RAMPING UP THERE. COAL PLANTS WE NEED TO REALLY START TO DIG INTO THIS SORRY HAVE GONE ON SINCE THE DAY WAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED IF WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT WILL ACTUALLY COME BACK TO BITE US. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE PAST WE CONTINUE TO TO THINK THAT THE SCALE OF THE KINDS OF CHANGES WE'RE SEEING IN THE WORLD AROUND US. MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO APPROACH A LOT OF THINGS DIFFERENTLY IT'S NOT SO MUCH JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. TO PREVENT CLIMATE CHANGE IS WHAT DO WE DO NOW THAT IT'S HERE AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IN TERMS OF FIRES. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IS GONE AWAY FROM SOLELY RELYING ON THOSE HARD AND FAST STANDARDS THE THE COMPLIANCE STANDARDS. THAT WE ADOPT EVERYBODY STILL SHOULD MEET THOSE AND WE NEED TO GO OUT AND BE BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE IN AUDITING AND POLICING THEIR THEIR COMPLIANCE. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO TREAT EVERY SECTION OF GAS PIPELINE EVERY POLL EVERY WIRE THE SAME SOME ARE MORE LIKELY TO IN IN IN A CHANGING WORLD CREATE PROBLEMS. HOW DO YOU DEFINE THEN? THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOVE THOSE STANDARDS DON'T LET THOSE STANDARDS BECOME OF A CEILING HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY IDENTIFY HAZARDS AND RISKS. THAT STAND OUT AND ALSO FOCUS ON THEM SO ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE HAD UNDERWAY FOR SOME TIME. IS ACTUALLY JUST THAT WE ASK UTILITIES COME IN AND GIVE US A RISK MAP AND THEN TELL US HOW ALL THEIR EXPENDITURES ACTUALLY REDUCE THOSE RISKS. SO WE GET MORE SAFETY AND MORE SAFE BETTER AT THIS. WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY POLICE. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY GOOUT AND POLICE EVERYONE OF THOSE POLLS AND ALL THOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OF MILES OF WIRE. WE PROBABLY NEED FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND NEW STAFF PEOPLE. THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WOULD BE A HUGE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE SHOULD BE A BIG COST. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE CAN BEGIN TO FLY THEM WITH DRONES THIS IS SOMETHING UTILITIES DO. YOU KNOW WE CAN DEVELOP PATTERN RECOGNITION OVER TIME -- JUST AS WITH THE ENERGY IS ATION WE CAN LEARN TO USE TECHNOLOGY MACHINE LEARNING AND OTHER TOLSON UL ON OUR OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIRECTOR HAS ACTUALLY GONE SO FAR. AS TO PULL TOGETHER THE WORLD'S FIRST WILDFIRE IN TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE WHICH IS CO SPONSORED BY THE P. YOU SEE -- WE ASK CAL FIRE UC SAN DIEGO WHICH HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES C. S. U. S. AND THEN A COUPLE OF LARGE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS AS A WAY TO BEGIN THAT CONVERSATION WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT SHOULD WE BE USING HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. GET BETTER THAN THAN THIS HOW DO WE OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES THE SCALE OF THESE -- INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. SO I WILL SAY THAT ON TOP OF THAT WE ALSO ARE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER HUNDRED INSPECTORS. TO DEAL AND I'LL COME BACK TO THIS IN SB NINE THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IN THE WORK THERE IT'S ORDERED THROUGH THE ADVANCED VERY WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT YOU YOU YOU THAT YOU SET FORTH IN SB -- NINE OH ONE SO I THINK THAT DE WE CAN'T ABANDON. THOSE TRADITIONAL THINGS BUT WE HAVE TO GO WAY BEYOND THAT THE SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING HERE ELSEWHERE. IS REALLY A CHALLENGE. AND LASTED THESE -- THESE TRANCES THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY. AND IT'S VALUABLE AND I THINK THAT WE'VE TRIED TO BE WISE AND CHOICES. BUT A LOT OF THAT IS BUILT AROUND THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S ASSUMPTION THAT IS GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF A LECTURE IT VEHICLES. AND AS WE SEE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES STARTING TO EMERGE THERE'S THREE COMPANIES NOW HAVE LICENSES TO ACTUALLY DRIVE THEM HEARING CALIFORNIA. DOES YOUR FLEET'S. THEY'RE NOT OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF ELECTRIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. I KEEP LOOKING FOR THE PLACING K. CITY CALIFORNIA THAT CAN TELL ME. HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT? I TALK TO PEOPLE ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT IS IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A LECTURE TO SCOOTERS AND ELECTRIC BICYCLES NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE USING MORE AND MORE FOR THEIR SHORT TRIPS. IN SAN DIEGO THE UTILITY DESCRIBES TO ME THAT ONE OF THE SCOOTER COMPANIES HAS A DEAL WHERE IF YOU TAKE SIX SCOOTERS HOME IN CHARGE AT HOME. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU GET FREE USE AND SPECIFIC ELECTRIC IMPACT. IF YOU DO THAT ON THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE CHARGING IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED. THESE SIR TRENDS THAT ARE EMERGING VERY QUICKLY AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THEM BECAUSE I AM LEARNING ABOUT THEM STRUGGLING WITH THEM. AND I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU IS THE UTILITY COMMITTEE TO START TO THINK ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT ALL THE STATE AGENCIES NEED IN TERMS OF SOME OF THESE THINGS. SO MY APOLOGIES FOR GOING ON A MINUTE OF THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT REALLY QUICKLY. SO WE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED AS PART OF OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE -- BOTH OF THE WHAT WE CALL OUR VEGETATE HOW WILD FIRE HAZARD MAPS. I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THEM BUT THAT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS OF WORK WE DON'T UNDERSTAND FIRES WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. ON A TIMBER FORESTRY OR OR OR DAHLE LANDSCAPE ISSUES WE DO INFRASTRUCTURE -- ANSWER WE DEPENDED ON THEM WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO DEVELOP WHAT IS NOW AT THIS POINT THE WAR THE US IS STRONGEST VEGETATION -- STANDARDS IN TERMS OF CLEARANCES FOR POLES AND WIRES. ON THE LEGISLATURE ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND TEETH WE'VE WORKED VERY QUICKLY TWO TO IMPLEMENT THAT THOSE NEW PLANTS ARE BEING -- REVIEWED WILL BE ADOPTED THIS SPRING HERE'S FIRE SEASON. WE ARE WE AT THAT'S THAT'S THE RULING UNDER WHICH WE EXPECT TO BRING ON A HUNDRED NEW INSPECTORS SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS ON HIGH HAZARD SO WE'LL FOCUS A LITTLE BIT A NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND THEN WE'LL START TO GO INTO THE HIGHER HAZARDOUS TO GO BACK TO THAT THAT TO WHAT I WAS DISCUSSING OF OF NOT TREATING EVERY POLL SOME OF WHICH ARE ARE NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM NOT EVERY WIRE. BUT REALLY LOOKING AWARE WE THINK THERE'S THE BEST OWN BENEFIT FOR THE FOR THE SAFETY -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT ON MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS COST RECOVERY -- THERE WE HAVE A PROCEEDING IN UNDER WAY WE SHE HAD EXPECT THE LATE -- FOR EVERY WORKSHOP WHICH WILL BE LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE THE US. AND THE QUICK QUESTION HERE IS IF THE UTILITY GETS IN TROUBLE AND AND THEY CAN'T FINANCE ALL OF THE COSTS. WHAT WE DO NEW BILL YOU GAVE US DIRECTION SB NINE HUNDRED TO THE STRESS TESTS AND THEN TO ACTUALLY SET A LIMIT AS TO HOW MUCH THE UTILITY? SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO SECURITIZED THAT AGAINST FUTURE REVENUES SO THAT THEY CAN WITHSTAND THE PRESSURES. ON HOW I WILL SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THE QUESTION WHY WE DIDN'T JUST START WITH THAT NUMBER. AND I'LL JUST POINT TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY WHERE CAL FIRE ISSUED RECENTLY IT'S IT'S PHONE A REPORT ON THE TUBS FIRE. AND FOUND THAT P. JEANNIE WAS NOT. RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT READ THAT REDUCE THEIR THEIR OVERALL RISK IF WE GIVEN THE A NUMBER IN ADVANCE OF THAT FINDING WOULD BE BACK READJUSTING THAT NUMBER RIGHT TODAY IN THE DANGER IS IF THEY HAD ACTED ON THAT AND WE HAVE ALLOWED THEM SECURITIZED. BASED ON THAT THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD BE A RISK TO RATE PAYERS SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK WE NEED RULES WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT TILL THEY FILE A A A A PRECEDING A REQUEST TO RECOVER. AFTER ALL THE COSTS ARE KNOWN. AS OPPOSED TO UP FRONT. ONE PLEASES THE THE THE THE THE BANKS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE RISK IS. BUT THE OTHER POOR BUT THAT ALSO PUTS RATEPAYERS AT RISK SO WE CHOOSE TO TO TAKE A MORE SLOW PROCESS AT THE BACK AND SO THE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY -- BE FAIR TO THE UTILITIES BUT ESPECIALLY TO FOCUS ON RATE PAYER INTERESTS -- SO I JUST GOTTA KEEP GOING HERE ON ON SOME OF THE OTHER -- WILDFIRE IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS SO WE HAVE UNDER WAY AND THEN I'LL COME BACK TO TO A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN IN TERMS OF THE BANKRUPTCY. SO JULY WE DID RULES FOR D. ENERGIES ATION OF POWER LINES. IS BASED ON AND CLOSE ARE OF OBSERVATION OF THE EFFORTS THAT SCENE DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THEIR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FIRES. AND BASICALLY THEY HAVE REALLY PUT OUT A LOT OF TELEMETRY THEY COLLECT A LOT THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE BEEN STUDYING WIND PATTERNS THEY KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL WILD SERVICE WIND -- ON MEASUREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE TAKEN IT PEAKS CAUSES MOSTLY AIMED AVIATION. BUT IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FIRE YOU REALLY WANT TO BE LOOKING AT THE BOTTOMS OF THE CANYON. SO THEY HAD TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW WEATHER SYSTEM WITHIN THEIR SERVICE AREA THEY DEVELOPED NEW. MODELING TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT NOT JUST ACROSS THE REGION WHICH IS WHAT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE WHILE THE NATIONAL FEATHER WEATHER SERVICE DOES. BUT IN EACH CANYON. SO THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY CUT OFF POWER BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH WINDS AND POTENTIAL FOR HAD DOWNED POWER LINE. THEY ONLY DO IT WHERE THEY NEED THEY DON'T TAKE OUT THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS. BUT IT'S TAKEN OF ABOUT SEVEN YEARS TO REALLY DEVELOP THIS NAY WHO I'VE BEEN WATCHING SINCE I FIRST CAME TO WORK ON RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS AN IMPORTANT. APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE SAFETY. AND I THINK IT'S PROVED ITSELF WE'VE ORDERED THE OTHER UTILITIES TO DO IT BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCALE THAT THE SAID THE UTILITIES ARE OPERATING AT AND THE FACT THAT THEY DEPEND ON THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WHICH WHEN IT IN SHOES A WIND WARNING DOES IT ACROSS. SIX OR SEVEN COUNTIES. NOT WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL CANYON TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE THE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DE ENERGIZE YOU CAN ALSO CUT OFF OF IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NEED SO. WE'VE FIVE WE HAVE -- OPEN THE WAY TO ME IN IN OCTOBER CPC CALLOW S. AND AND CAL FIRE ISSUED A JOINT LETTER UTILITIES WITH FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE AIMED AT SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE BOTH IN TERMS OF WARNING AND PRE PREPARATION. IN THE END ABOUT DECEMBER THE UTILITIES FILED THEIR FIRST SAID A REPORTS ON THIS AND WERE EVALUATING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE THE PROCESS. SO APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ADOPTED PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS SO ON WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR PHONES TO WHAT IS OUR EXPECTATION OF THE TELL BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S WATER BACK ON WHEN THEY GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES. HOW DO WE PROVIDE OTHER KINDS OF VITAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED BOTH BEFORE DURING AND AFTER WE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FIRE SHELTERS? WERE STARTING TO LOOK AT NOW IS WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL THESE UTILITIES IN TERMS OF HELPING TO PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES -- THEY'RE THEY'RE BIG GAPS IN WARNINGS AND TELECOMMUNICATION I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT ARE PROCEEDING. ON THE COUNTY OF CINEMAS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM REALLY. SHARP YOUNG FIREFIGHTERS ACT CAMEL ACTUALLY DID ALLOW A BACK CAST AND LOOKED AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY RELAYING WARNINGS THAT THE COUNTY AND OTHER PROVIDERS PUT OUT. HE THOUGHT THAT THE 50% WAS FAILURES AND TECHNOLOGY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY. A MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD EXPECTATIONS OF SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO ARE CHALLENGES THAT THE TELCOS DO THIS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS IF THE USE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES THAN WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER THEM TO DO THINGS. THIS WILL COME UP IN THE YEAR -- RECONSIDERATION OF SB ELEVEN NINETY WHICH DE REGULATED VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOLS -- YES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON DID HIS HAS COME FORWARD WITH THE NOVEL PROPOSAL FOR GRID HARDENING. SUPPOSED UNDER GROUNDING IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WHICH IS LARGELY INEFFECTIVE YOU'RE GOING UP AND DOWN RAVINES OR SUBJECT TO TO INTRUSION BY WATER -- THEY THEY FOUND THAT A BETTER WHICH SOLUTION WAS WAS COATED -- IMPROVED COATINGS AND CONDUCTORS SO THERE IS A WE'VE GIVEN WE ARE CONSIDERING GIVING THEM PERMISSION TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THAT -- EXPECT THAT TO TO BE DONE SOMETIME THIS MONTH. HER SAFETY CULTURE -- I WE'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT AT CONTINUED FAILURES ON SAFETY WITHIN P. JEANNIE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT THAT WE USE TO CONDITION THEIR AUTHORITY TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT BETTER IS A CHANGE IN THE BOARD IS A PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD. HIS IS SPLITTING UP THE GAS FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITY IS IT SMALLER DIVISIONS. ARE THOSE ARE ALL BIG QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE'S A NEED THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VERY HIGHLY LITIGATED EFFORTS THAT REQUIRE US TO COLLECT A LOT OF EVIDENCE YOU CAN'T PROCEED TO BREAK UP. A PROPERTY LIKE THAT WITHOUT SOME THAT WERE AT THAT POINT. I'LL COME BACK TO HOW WE WILL USE OUR FINDINGS AND WHAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT LEARNINGS FROM OUR NEXT PHASE WHICH IS THE REMEDIES WHAT DO YOU DO. WHEN YOU FIND THE COMPANY HAS NOT MET ITS -- IT'S RESPONSIBILITIES -- WE FIND THEM WE FIND IN THE BIGGEST UTILITY FINE EVER. AND NOT A SINGLE BOARD MEMBER LAUGHTER AND THERE ARE NO MAJOR CHANGES A STAFF SO THAT TELLS ME THAT IT'S NOT FINES ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH -- WE NEED TO GO FURTHER IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW DO YOU GET TRUE SAFETY OUT OF OUT OF THESE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WILL PROBABLY PLAY INTO THE BANKRUPTCY STUFF I ALSO WANT -- TO MENTION THAT -- EXCUSE ME. IT WILL BE VOTING TOMORROW ON AND THE CHANGES THAT YOU ASKED US TO MAKE FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR BIOMASS FACILITIES WILL BE MEETING HERE IN SACRAMENTO IF FOUR HUNDRED R. STREET SO WILL BE -- FINALIZING OUR DELIBERATIONS ON THAT -- SO THAT'S A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE IN SB NINE A ONE IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS AND YOU THE RIRE IT AT A RELEASE OF VATICAN. CAN ANSWER THAT. SO IT IN TERMS A BANKRUPTCY. WE TOOK WHAT WHAT IS NOT REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP FOR US OF LAST EARLIER THIS WEEK WE ACTUALLY ADJUSTED THE RATIO BETWEEN THEIR DATA. AND THEIR EQUITY AND THAT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH UTILITIES THEY GROW. THE THEY HAVE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THEY NEED TO CHANGE THAT BUT THAT'S A METRIC THAT WE USED TO TO REALLY KIND OF KEEP. THE COST FROM BEING PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS IS PARRIS TO INVESTORS WITH IT'S A TOOL THE USED TO MONITOR EFFICIENCY OF THEIR USE OF CAPITAL. ON THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY WE MAKE THEM COME BACK TO US WHEN THEY WANT. TO DO ADDITIONAL FINANCING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE SO -- WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THE LAST WEEK WE GOT AN APPLICATION FROM P. GINNY ASKING TO CHANGE THEIR RATIO? AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE TELLING US THAT THEY WERE GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY. NOW FRANKLY WE PROBABLY WOULD HAD TO MAKE THE SAME KIND OF DECISION EVEN IF THEY HADN'T GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY BUT HAD GOT MORE DEBT FINANCING. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY NORMAL HERE THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST BECAUSE IT WENT INTO -- THIS THE INTO THIS DISCUSSION OF BANKRUPTCY. WE THINK THAT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE MADE A DECISION IN ADVANCE OF THEIR DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. BY DOING THAT WE PROTECT OUR ABILITY TO AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE REQUIRE THEM TO COME BEFORE US AND SHOW THE CP YOU SEE. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BORROWING AND THEIR EXPENDITURES WERE REASONABLE. AND IN THE BENEFIT RATE PAYERS. IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO SET STE REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT THEY USE FOR COLLATERAL FOR THAT PARTY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS WE THOUGHT THAT WE NEEDED TAKE THIS STEP IN ADVANCE OF THEIR DECLARATION OF BANKRUPTCY OTHERWISE THE JUDGE MAY HAVE SIMPLY SAID WELL. HE DIDN'T GET PERMISSION FROM THE C. P. YOU SEE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU PERMISSION BUT I'M NOT GONNA PUT STRINGS ON IT. SO FAR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEEDED TO DO THAT TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PLAY OUR ROLE OF PROTECTING THE RATE PAYERS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JUDGE WHO HAS TO MAKE A LOT OF OTHER KINDS OF DECISION UNDERSTOOD. THIS WAS ALREADY A REGULATORY REQUIREMENT ADVANCE OF BANKRUPTCY -- SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR ARE COURT GOALS HERE ARE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACCESS TO SAVE A RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE SERVICES KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S GAS. FLOWING FOR PEOPLE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR HEATING COOKING AND FOR BUSINESS. THAT THEY CONTINUE TO REPLACE WOODEN POLES ON THE SCHEDULE THAT THEY'VE BEEN REQUIRED TO DO THAT THAT THE REDUCE THE VEGETATION HAZARDS ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE OPERATING CAPITAL TO DO. CAN'T. PAY YOUR YOUR CONTRACTORS YOUR STAFF ON PROMISSORY NOTES YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE TO NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EVEN THOUGH IT'S EXPECTED SHUT DOWN IN SEVERAL YEARS. WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AND THE EMPLOYEES. ARE TREATED FAIRLY HE'S EMPLOYEES PARTICULARLY ARE ARE WHAT MAKES P. JEANNIE WORK WE NEED FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL SET TO USE THE EXAMPLE. OF THE LINE SUPERVISOR IN SAN BRUNO WHO'S DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY HEARD IN THE NEWS REPORTS KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE BREAK WAS. KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDED TO GO SHUT IT OFF YOU EXACTLY WHAT TOOLS YOU NEED STOPPED ON HIS WAY PICKED UP THE TOOLS WENT AND SHOWED OFF. BECAUSE P. GENIES COMMAND CENTER WAS DOWN. THEY COULDN'T COMMUNICATE THE COULDN'T TELL WHERE IT WAS. WE NEED THOSE PEOPLE TO STAY WITH THE ORGANIZATION. WE NEED FOR THEM TO BE THERE BOTH AFTER BANKRUPTCY BUT DURING THIS TIME TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AND TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE SERVICES WE NEED SAY. FOR WE GOT TO KEEP MAKING PROGRESS ON A CLEAN ENERGY -- GOALS IN REDUCING CLIMATE HAZARDS AND SO ALL THIS REQUIRES THEM TO ACTUALLY COMMIT. TO CONTINUE TO DO THOSE THINGS. AGAIN ALL THESE ISSUES OF BORROWING AND RELATED EXPENDITURES WILL COME BACK TO US AT SOME POINT FOR REASONABLE IN THIS REVIEW WE NEED TO DO THAT TO PROTECT THE RATE PAYERS. THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT HE WAS OF THE KIT JUDGE IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE BANKRUPTCY. AND DIE AND HE HAS FAMILIARITY WITH US HE IN THAT CASE HE DID DEFERRED US HE CHOSE OUR REORGANIZATION PLAN. OVER THE REORGANIZATION PLAN. IT WAS YOU KNOW THERE ARE COMPROMISES BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK WE PREVAILED AND AS A RESULT WE GOT A COMPANY THAT. DID PROVIDE GOOD [inaudible] CLEAN ENERGY -- I THINK THAT THAT WE PROBABLY WILL THINK ABOUT THINGS WE WANT TO DO DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME. WE WILL BE PARTY'S. WE ARE REPRESENTED BY A A WHITE CHIU WALL STREET THE FIRM I SAY THAT THE IT BECAUSE THEIR KNOWLEDGE. THEIR PLAYERS EVERYBODY KNOWS THEM THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF OTHER CORPORATE WORKOUTS MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND BANKRUPTCIES -- THE JUDGE WOULD KNOWS THEM THEY HAVE REPRESENTED THE P. YOU SEE CONTINUOUSLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SIR WE ACTUALLY HER FIRST HEARD ABOUT. GINNY'S PLANTS FROM THEM WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THAT WASN'T OUR PREFERENCE THAT YOU DID THAT P. JEANNIE PROJECT. PROCEED DOWN THIS COURSE. BUT THAT WAS THEIR CHOICE AND SO NOW WE'RE IN A WE ALSO HAVE HIRED A FAIRLY -- WELL KNOWN AND AFFECTIVE A FINANCIAL ADVISER WHO ALSO SPECIALIZES IN IN THESE EVENTS. SAID NGUYEN P. JEANNIE FILED. THEY ACTUALLY ON PUT TOGETHER THEIR FOR THEIR THEIR THEIR THIRTEEN DAY PLAN WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET TO THE NEXT THIRTEEN DAYS. IT MADE A LOT OF COMMITMENTS EMPLOYEE -- TO CONTRACTORS INCLUDING RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS TO A NUMBER OF OTHER FOLKS WHO HAD VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTS INCLUDING THE THE THE INTERVENE INTER THAT TO MEAN. THE INTERVENOR SAID ARE PROCEEDING SAID P. JEANNIE WHO WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR COMPENSATION WOULD BE PAID P. GINNY MADE THOSE PROMISES. THEY ALSO HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO WE'LL SUPPORT THEIR PROMISE THAT'S THEIR PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN IN IN GENERAL SUMMARY FOR TWO MINUTES ARE OPERATING PLEA OF IT IT'S NOT THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY BUT THEY WILL DO A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION TALK ABOUT HOW THEY GET OUT OF THE PROBLEM THE TO RANT. AND WE WILL -- CONTEND WITH THEM AS ADVOCATES FOR RATEPAYERS IN IN THE BANKRUPTCY AT THAT POINT. CELLS. OPERATING GOING TO IOWA REALLY WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS BUT NOW WE WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAD A GREAT LOT OF GROUND TO COVER AND THIS IS YOUR ANNUAL REVIEW SO WE ANTICIPATED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BROADER THAN -- THE SUBJECT THAT -- CERTAINLY IS CAPTURING EVERYONE'S ATTENTION RIGHT AT THE MOMENT I'M SORRY I SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE IS THERE ANYTHING YOU THINK THAT I MISSPOKE OR OKAY OKAY. OKAY. YEAH OKAY I JUST WANT TO ASK A QUICK QUESTION ON THE IMPACT OF ON THE MARKET HOW THE MARKETS ARE RESPONDING TO THE UTILITIES AND IN SOME INSTANCES -- GOING AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT -- WE MAY BE MOVING IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ON INVESTABLE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS THE THE COST OF FINANCING IMPACTS ULTIMATELY ON THE RATE PAYERS -- HOW DO YOU FIT IN AND QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF FOCUSES ON P. GINNY BUT THE IMPACT IS A REPORT IMPACT ON -- ESTY JEANNIE AND ALSO LISTEN. AND WE HAVE MANDATES WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS TO SEE CERTAIN PROGRAMS CONTINUE -- IF THE COST. OF FINANCING BECOMES. TO AGGRESSIVE. THAT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR REACTIONS THOUGHTS TO WHICH YOU SEE IN THE MARKETPLACE WHAT YOU'RE READING. I'M I CAN ACT LIKE I'M NOT. I'M NOT SURE I CAN SPECULATE I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THAT S. C. IS WAITING TO FIND OUT THE THE OUTCOMES OF INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH THE THOMAS IN THE WALL SEE FIRES. TO THAT COULD AFFECT THE HOME THERE FROM -- THE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR CAPITAL -- HIGH A I I I CAN ONLY SPECULATE AS TO WHY CAL FIRE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE GOING TO FIND. IF THE YOU KNOW. I DO THINK THAT AT THIS POINT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SCURRY ACT. BUT I THINK AS YOU GET THAT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE EVENTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIANS NEED. I THINK THAT WE CAN PROJECT A PRETTY GOOD -- MESSAGE IN THE ACTION THIS I THINK WILL BE ADDRESSED BY A BY OUR WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ANA I BUT I I I DO THINK THAT RIGHT AT THIS POINT. THEY'RE A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF US SHOULD THEY BE I DOUBT IT. SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT -- RENEGING ON CONTRACTS RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS I DOUBT IT P. JEANNIE SAID THEY WOULDN'T WE WON'T LET THEM. BUT THIS IS THE WORLD CHANGING VERY QUICKLY IN WAYS THAT NOBODY EXPECTED. AND SO PEOPLE GET NERVOUS. SAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS BUT ALL OF TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR. OF THE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPENING THOUGHT. UP COUPLED. IT'S A LITTLE OBSERVATION -- WITH RESPECT -- TO THE I GUESS THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT READ IN. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH RESPECT TO RATE AND BILLS. WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH RATES LIKE THIS YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCING PEOPLE? TO USE LESS ELECTRICITY. AND THEY ARE MANAGING THEIR UTILITY BILLS BY THEIR COMFORT LEVELS AND BY THEIR INCONVENIENCE. BY THE HIGH COST I THINK IT IS -- A BIT -- INSENSITIVE TO SUGGEST THAT. SOMEHOW. THE POLICIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS. LEGISLATURE IN OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE ARE ARE WORTHY OF CONGRATULATORY COMMENTS. A YOU ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO USE LESS ELECTRICITY BY THE HIGH PRICE TAGS. ON THEM AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT. SUGGEST THAT -- HUNDRED AND FIVE DEGREE NO -- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE PRICE WISE TO BE COMFORTABLE. AND SO LET'S JUST REMEMBER THE CONSEQUENCES THAT SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE HAVING. ON REAL PEOPLE I WANT TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON A YEP ARTICLE BY JULIE. CART AND CAL MATTERS IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE. ITS TITLE IS CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID IS IN CRISIS CAN THE STATE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR STATEMENT IN IT. QUOTING UP WE ARE IN THE DEPTHS OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE MANDATES AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD PRESENTLY. YOU SAID -- YOU CAUTION. THAT EVEN AS THE SYSTEM IS BEING RE BOOTED. THERE'S NO REAL PLAN. FOR MAKING IT ALL WORK. HERE WE ARE THE FIFTH OR SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WELL INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. YOU SEE SAYS THERE'S NO REAL PLAN. FOR MAKING IT ALL WORK. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PLEASE I'M I'M NOT SURE WHAT ARTICLE YOU'RE REFERRING TO SELL MY APOLOGIES BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE WAS ACTUALLY IT'S AN APP DURING SOMETHING I SAID STE ALL SITE THIS AGAIN JULIE CART JANUARY SIXTEENTH. TWENTY NINETEEN IT WAS AND CAL MATTERS REPUBLISHED IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE. I THINK THAT SHE'S TAKING COMMENTS I MADE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT THIS PROCESS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. WHEN I SAID WE NEEDED TO START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN ELECTRICITY MARKETS AND BEGIN TO PLAN FOR IT? AND TO BE AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE IN LOOK FOR THE BEST PRACTICES AROUND THE COUNTRY. HERE IS WHAT WE THE PLAN IT'S GET CALLS FOR INTERNAL ACTIONS SOME OF WHICH WERE TO UNDERTAKING SOME OF WHICH THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS TAKING. BUT SOME OF IT MAY REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION SO WILL I THINK THAT. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE WE ARE CONCERNED WE SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME ANSWERS. AND HERE THEY ARE. ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU DID NOT. MAKE THESE COMMENTS TO JULIE CART NO I HAVE HONORING AROUND JANUARY SIXTEENTH NO I DID NOT TALK TO HER. YOU ARE YOU ARE QUOTED THAT THAT THERE'S NO REAL PLAN FOR MAKING IT ALL WORK SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SOMETHING I SAID AT THE FIRST MEETING KICKING OFF THIS PREVENT ENEMY FOLLOW IT UP. CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID IS IN CRISIS THAT'S THE HEADLINE. CAN THE STATE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON I'M ASKING YOU DIRECTLY DO YOU TODAY HAVE CONCERN OVER RELIABILITY. AND THE ABILITY TO KEEP. THE LIGHTS ON AND TO QUOTE MAKE IT ALL WORK WITH THE KINDS OF MANDATES THAT ARE BEING -- PUT FORWARD PRESENTLY. I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S SOLELY THE MANDATES I THINK IT'S THE LACK OF THE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS THAT WE IDENTIFY HERE THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT THAT POINT NOW. I THINK THAT WE CAN EASILY SLIP INTO IT IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTION THAT'S WHY SPEND TIME TRYING TO TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS I WANTED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES. WE HAVE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THEM MAY REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND THEN WHAT WE CAN DO IS GET MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS OUT ALL ALL YEAH -- WE WE TALKED TO A TO I I WANT TO MAKE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT. UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING THAT DE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID IS NOT IN CRISIS DO YOU DISPUTE THE BASIC ARTICLE IN. YOU ESSENTIALLY DISPUTE AGGRESSION BAKI IN HER BOOK THE GRID AT CENTS HOWEVER BETTER BOOK I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT ALL RIGHT BUT I'D I DON'T THINK WE ARE CRISIS I THINK THAT IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION WE CAN SLIDE INTO IT. GOOD ENOUGH THANK YOU EARNER DOCTOR QUIRK -- THANK YOU FIRST WITH REGARD I WILL DEFINITELY READ THE COMMUNITY CHOICE. OUR CUSTOMERS CHOICE PROJECT AND IF YOU'RE LEGISLATIVE PEOPLE COULD COME TO ME. AND SUGGEST WHICH OF THESE THINGS REQUIRE LEGISLATION I'M CERTAINLY GLAD TO LOOK INTO IT I THINK. YOU DID A GOOD JOB ON THAT. I AM STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIVISION OF COSTS BETWEEN THE AGGREGATORS. AND IN A I DO KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PETERMAN SUGGESTION THAT THE OLDER COST. FOR DAMS AND THE EARLY -- VERY EXPENSIVE SOLAR AND WIND PROJECTS -- BE DIVIDED UP. BUT THE THAT'S GONNA BE HAND ON THE DETAILS OF HOW IT'S DONE AND I KNOW THAT -- MARTHA. MARTHA GOODMAN -- IS NOW THE PERSON LOOKING AT THAT AND I'M JUST NOW WHO IS LOOKING AT IT NOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ME -- IT'S YEAR WELL. PLEASE PLEASE DO A GOOD JOB ON THAT -- I KNOW IT YOU KNOW THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. AND AS YOU CONTINUING PGA COMMISSIONER WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT ALWAYS SEEMS TO DEPEND ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO WELL I JUST IS SO THE CHAIR OF UTILITIES. IN THE SENATE SAID IF THE THURMOND SOLUTION THAT IF YOU ENDED UP WITH. ONE P. JEANNIE CUSTOMER THEY KNOW BILLIONS SO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE END UP WITH ONE P. JEANNIE CUSTOMER THEY DON'T KNOW BILLION SO THAT'S ALL. WELL UP AGAIN -- COMMISSIONER PETER MEN CAME UP WITH A VERY TOUGH DECISION THAT WAS NOT UNIVERSALLY POPULAR YEAH AND I SUSPECT THAT I WILL ALSO COME UP WITH THE DECISION THAT'S NINE UNIVERSALLY POPULAR. HOUSE AND SO FORTY JUSTICE WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN SOME AREAS THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE OUR DECISIONS WHO MAY ASK YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE GOT TORY I THINK YOU DO. THAT'S WHY THIS REPORT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT YEAH. THEN MY NEXT QUESTION REALLY DEALS WITH THE OTHER UTILITIES AND WHY THEY ARE GOING INTO PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW STANDARD AND POOR'S FITCH. MOODY HAVE MADE THE BONDS FOR AT THIS IN AND FOR SEMPRA. SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE JUNK BOND STATUS SO THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THEY'RE CONSIDERED MEDIUM OR LOW QUALITY RIGHT NOW THAT COULD WELL GET. TO A JUNK BOND STATUS. AND IT'S REALLY THE FACT THAT AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THIS THE FACT THAT P. JEANNIE WAS FOUND. NOT TO HAVE CAUSED THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRE. REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE LOST AND YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD YES AND THAT'S GOOD -- BASICALLY THEY'VE LOST OUR ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS AND THEY WERE THEY HAVE TO BORROW TWO BILLION EVERY YEAR. IN ORDER TO GO ON AND JUST DO THEIR NORMAL SERVICE AND THEY COULD NO LONGER DO THAT. BOB AND THAT'S AND THEN THE WHILE THEY DO HAVE CASH AVAILABLE. ONCE YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD CREDIT. THEN THE ENERGY COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING YOU ENERGY DEMAND THAT YOU PUT MONEY IN THE BANK. AND MY SON WAS IN CHARGE OF LOOKING AT HOW YOU WOULD IN FACT PUT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BANK AND THERE REALLY WASN'T ENOUGH. SO WAS REALLY THE CREDIT MARKETS THAT BECAUSE THAT. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT. WITHOUT. ANY -- DETERMINATION OF WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WHAT -- FITCH SAID IS WE COULD LOWER OUR RATINGS ON THE COMPANY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON BY ONE OR MORE NOTCHES. IF POLITICIANS AND ARE REGULATORS DO NOT TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO TAKE. EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THESE GROWING RISKS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. NOW I'M GOING TO READ SOMETHING SO WHEN. PGA ANY IN THEIR LAST -- DISASTER AID IN SAN BRUNO -- IT WAS ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULD AT RETAIN ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS AND THAT WAS STATED AS A OBJECTIVE UP FRONT BY. THE OUR COMMISSION AND ALTHOUGH THAT POPPED AGAIN AND NOT POPULAR DECISION. OF RATE PAYERS PAID A CERTAIN AMOUNT P. JEANNIE PAID A CERTAIN AMOUNT THEY HAVE A CERTAIN FIND AT CETERA. THAT WAS ALL DONE WITHOUT SB NINE A WIDE. NOW WHAT P. GENIE IS SAID IN THEIR FILING ON PAGE EIGHT UPON PAGE [inaudible] FIVE OF THE FORM EIGHT K. THAT THEY DELIVERED ON THE FOURTEENTH -- DATED OF THE THIRTEENTH. ARE THEY EXPLICITLY SAID. THAT THE CPUC. AND YOU CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT THEY'RE SAYING HERE BUT THIS IS THE REASON THEY SAY THAT THAT THEY GAVE UP HOPE. ADOPTED IN ORDER INSTITUTING RULE MAKING THE I ARE SO I'M GOING TO SAY -- WHEN I REFER TO THIS PARTICULAR RULING BY THE COMMISSION -- ESTABLISHED PROCESS DEVELOP CRITERION A METHODOLOGY TO INFORM DETERMINATION OF WHO WOULD PAY FOR WHAT IN THE WILD FIRES -- AND IN THE I. R. C. P. YOU STATED THAT CONSISTENT WITH SECTION FORTY FIVE FOUR FIVE ONE POINT TO A DID YOU TERMINATION OF WHAT COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. MUST BE MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN APPLICATION FOR THE RECOVERY OF SPECIFIC COSTS. RELATED TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES [inaudible] NOW WHAT. THEY GO ON TO SAY IN THIS WHAT J. P. JEANNIE SAYS IS THAT. THEY THEN LOST CONFIDENCE. THAT ARE THE P. YOU SEE WOULD ALLOW THEM. TO SECURITIZED THIS IN IN PARTICULAR. THEY FEEL THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD -- TO PAY EVERYTHING UP FRONT AND THEN HAVE A DETERMINATION AND THEY WEREN'T AT ALL SURE WITH THAT DETERMINATION WOULD BE. AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT P. G. ANY EQUIPMENT THAT BECAUSE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRE IN THE TUBS CASE. THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE SUING THEM BECAUSE THEY GET IN TURN POWER OFF AND IN THE CASE OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. YOU MADE THEM FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST BECAUSE THEY HADN'T TURNED THE POWER OFF. IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A DANGEROUS SITUATION. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT DECISION OR DO YOU IN THESE CASES. BUT THE FACT IS THAT BECAUSE OF THIS -- WHY ARE THIS? AGAIN C. P. U. C. P.YOU SEE ORDER THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY COULD NO LONGER GET ANY KIND OF CREDIT. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY -- DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR WHY ARE IN FACT DIDN'T DO THIS AND IF SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE I ARE DID. FIRST OFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M ALWAYS GONNA NOT WHEN YOU TALK THANK YOU. SO AGAIN IT'S OUR BELIEF BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T ADOPT YOUR BILL THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECTED US TO DO THAT'S THAT'S FIRST IN OUR MINDS WHEN WHEN WHEN YOUR YOUR BILL WITH DID NOT SHOW UP IN IN IN -- SB NINE ONE OUR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT YOU WANTED TO USE OUR EXISTING PROCESSES WHICH REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY BRING FORWARD ALL THE CLAIMS AT ONE TIME. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY ASSESS THEIR COSTS. IF WE HAD DONE THAT IN ADVANCE OF THE TUBS FIRE WE MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO BORROW MORE MONEY AT BAD RATES. TO BE ABLE TO PAY CLAIMS THAT THEY WEREN'T REQUIRED TO DO AND THAT WOULD BEEN PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS SO IN OUR IT IN IN OUR ESTIMATION WE DO NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE FULL COSTS IN ONE APPLICATION. IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT BANKRUPTCY COURTS TO THE ASSEMBLED ALL THE CREDITORS IN ONE PLACE SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED JUDGMENT AMONGST ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLAIMS YEAH BUT WHAT P. GENIES SANE AND THIS IS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE WHY ARE. IS THAT THEY WOULD THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY ALL THE CLAIMS AND THEN THEY WERE NOT AT ALL SURE. THAT YOU WOULD IN FACT ALLOW THEM TO SECURITIZED AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD KEEP THEM OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. AND THEY FEEL THAT'S THE REASON WHY THE CREDIT MARKETS AFTER THIS HEARING REMAIN CLOSE TO THEM AND THEY SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A THEY MADE THEIR DECISION BASED ON THEIR OWN REASONS AND THEY WENT TO HAD EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE COSTS FOR THE TUB FIRE WHICH REDUCE. THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY THEY COULD HAVE GONE OUT FOR FINANCING. THIS WAS THEIR CHOICE AYE AYE I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL THEM YEA OR NAY. THIS WAS THEIR CHOICE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT. IS WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT WELL AGAIN THEY'RE SAYING THEY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY NOT BECAUSE OF THESE LIABILITIES. BUT BECAUSE THE CREDIT MARKETS WERE CLOSED TO THEM BECAUSE OF THIS DECISION THAT YOU MADE ON JANUARY TENTH BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GO OUT TO TALK. AGAIN. AFTER THE TUBS FIRE TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS SOME FORM OF FINANCING THAT MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY MET THEIR NEEDS THEY WENT AHEAD. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TUBS ANNOUNCEMENT SO I CAN'T I CAN'T PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES I KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. I KNOW WHAT THEY DID DOESN'T MATCH UP ALL RIGHT SO GIVEN THE WHY ARE THAT YOU HAVE. SHOULD EDITION AND ARM A SEVEN SAN DIEGO -- GAS ELECTRIC SHOULD THEY BE CONFIDENT. THAT IF THEY HAVE A FIRE. AND THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO SECURITIZED THIS IN SUCH A WAY. THAT IT WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO GO INTO IT THAT'LL KEEP THEM OUT OF BANKRUPTCY SHOULD THEY BE CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS. IS STANDARD AND POOR'S FITCH AND MOODY'S ARE THEY BEING ARE THEY THEY SAID THEY DON'T TRUST YOU. BASICALLY THE STATE SAY THEY DON'T TRUST ANYBODY IN CALIFORNIA SOME WELL THAT'S TRUE. BUT THEY'RE SAYING THEY DON'T TRUST YOU WHAT CAN YOU DO THAT TRUST OR WHAT CAN WE DO TO GAIN THEIR TRUST THAT WE REALLY WILL ALLOW THEM TO SECURITIZED ENOUGH DEBT. THAT THEY DON'T GO INTO BANKRUPTCY I CAN'T MAKE FALSE PROMISES IF WE WERE TO ADOPT A NUMBER. AND THEY WERE TO BORROW AGAINST IT. AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WAS A REASONABLE. TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO REQUIRE RATE SHAREHOLDERS TO TAKE UP THEIR SHARE OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM WHICH IS DONE IN THE CASE OF SAN BRUNO BUT IS NOT BEEN DONE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL HERE? THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE ENOUGH EQUITY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS THAT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR. IN THE CASE OF SAN BRUNO AS A RESULT OF THAT THE VICTIMS WERE ABLE TO BE PAID. WHEN THEY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT YOUR FOR SCENE OR THAT A PARTICULAR CLAIM IS FORCING THIS IS SOMETHING WALL STREET IS? FORTY YOU HAVE TO ASSURE WALL STREET THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO SECURITIZED ENOUGH DEBT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY IF YOU DO THAT. THEIR CREDIT CAN GO UP AGAIN AND THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY AND WE CAN THEN ASSURE THAT THE FIRE VICTIMS WILL GET PAID I'M A LITTLE DUBIOUS ABOUT THAT -- BUT I WILL SAY THE HI YOU YOU MISTAKE WHAT WE DID IN THE SAN BRUNO DECISION THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BANKRUPTCY THAT HAD TO DO WITH HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND THEM. BEFORE THEIR COST OF BORROWING WENT UP THAT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CASE. AT THAT POINT ALL THE COSTS WERE KNOWN. ALL THE COSTS HAVE BEEN SETTLED. HERE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE SETTLEMENTS ARE WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER AT THE END I FEAR. THAT IF WE WERE TO TAKE THAT JUMP RIGHT NOW WE COULD END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE RATE PAYERS ARE NOT BEING TREATED FAIRLY WELL WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHAT THE NUMBER IS YOU JUST HAVE TO ASSURE. WALL STREET THAT YOU WILL DO IT IN A WAY SUCH THAT. THE COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION NOT ABOUT A SPECIFIC NUMBER. BUT ABOUT WHAT YOUR PROCESS I'M SORRY I THINK THAT THAT IS THAT WITH THE CONVERSATION AS THEY WANT A SPECIFIC NUMBER NINE OH NINE AND I THINK I THINK WE CAN STOP YOU. GOT [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT I'M NOT A I'M NOT WE'RE GOING -- TO TURN TO DOCTOR WOULD HE HAD A QUESTION AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- IT WILL CONSIDER YOU AN EX OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AS HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND AND AND NOT ONLY THAT HAS. BEEN SOMEONE WHO'S REPRESENTED AN AREA THAT WAS -- IMPACTED GREATLY FROM THESE WILDFIRES AND SO WE WELCOME YOU TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY. HERE THE FLOOR WELL THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY IN THE INVITATION -- TO TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS AND TO HEAR -- YOU KNOW SINCE WE LAST. SO EACH OTHER ACROSS A DÃ­AS -- WE HAVE BEEN -- ANOTHER EIGHTY SIX DEATHS -- IN CALIFORNIA -- IF YOU DISCOUNT THE THE EIGHTY TAKE THE CAL FIRE REPORTING HEN YOU SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM FROM THE WILD FIRES -- IN -- SANTA ROSA AREA IS NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR P. JEANNIE AND THEN YOU START ADDING NUMBERS OUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE IN THE CAMPFIRE BUT IT'S REALLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR UTILITY -- BASED ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING. WERE WELL OVER A HUNDRED DEATHS WERE WERE WELL. IN THESE FIRES AND SO. I GUESS I WILL TELL YOU I WAS -- PERPLEXED AND KIND OF SURPRISED THAT. THAT I KNOW THAT THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AROUND SB NINE A ONE STARTED IN JANUARY -- I I I KNOW THAT BY LAW THE THAT -- NO WE WE ACTUALLY WE ACT TOOK WE STARTED WORKING ON COMPONENTS OF IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER ADOPTION SOME OF THE WE PREPARED FOR IN ADVANCE WHAT I BELIEVE THE AND I BELIEVE THE ANNOUNCEMENT YOUR MEETING WAS IT WAS THAT. THAT YOU WERE BEGINNING AND EIGHTEEN MONTH RULE MAKING PROCESS THAT I MET THAT I MIGHT IS I'M MISTAKEN ON THAT WE ARE ACTING ON SEPARATE PIECES. SO THE I THINK THAT WHEN YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO IS THE THE METHODOLOGY FOR DOING THE STRESS TEST THAT THE REAL IT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE THE OTHER COMPONENTS WE'VE MOVED TO HEAD ON IMPLEMENTING THE NEW WILDFIRE REQUIREMENTS WE'VE MOVED TO ADD ON THE BIO MASTER IN. A VOTE ON THAT TOMORROW -- WE CIVIC REQUIREMENTS I CAN I CAN TURN TO STAFF FOR MORE BUT THAT'S THAT'S ONLY THE ONE PIECE WE BROKE IT UP SO THAT WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY. WELL AND THEN I GUESS A THAT THAT COMMUNICATION THAT ISN'T THAT ISN'T CLEAR TO US HERE SO SO. WAY WE INTERPRET WAS THAT THE RULE MAKING PROCESS WAS GOING TO BE BEGAN IT WAS GONNA BE AN EIHTEEN MONTH PROCESS AND SO AS I READ ME IS LIKE OKAY SO WHERE IS THE URGENCY HERE. SO I'M I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE THE FIRE PLANTS ARE GOING I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS NEXT PROCEEDING HOWEVER THEY'RE GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF PARTIES WERE LOADED FOR BEAR BECAUSE UNLESS WE DO THIS CAREFULLY AND PROPERLY THEN. RATEPAYERS COULD BE DISADVANTAGED WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW GREAT THAT THAT THE I PREACH I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT AS I SAID BEFORE. A DEAD PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DIE IN THESE FIRES ARE PRETTY DISADVANTAGED TO AGREE TO AND SO SO WHEN I LOOK AT WHEN I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS YEAR. ADD A WILDFIRE SEASON WILL PROBABLY START IN APRIL. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HELP PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE YOU TO OF OF THE SERVICES? AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO LIVE IN IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHAT WILL YOU DO THIS YEAR TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS SO. I'LL GO BACK TO THE WORK TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF WARNING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY WARNINGS FAILED. HOW DO WE ACTUALLY IMPROVE THEIR WHEN INFORMATION NEEDS TO COME TO TO TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHAT NEEDS TO COME FROM THE WARNING CENTERS? HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE THE -- THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SERVICES TO TO FOLKS THIS IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION BECAUSE AGAIN THEY WHAT THEY TELL US IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY. THERE. EFFORTS ARE PER VOLUNTARY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU FIND IN THE RESPONSE TO CINEMA COUNTY. IN TERMS OF THEIR QUESTIONS IN THEIR THEIR EFFORTS TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE WARNING SYSTEM THERE -- WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS SINCE -- SINCE EARLIER THIS YEAR SEEING OUR PROCESS IS TO REALLY BUILD THE CASE. THAT IN A REGULATE IN A IN A FORMAL WAY THAT THAT WE'RE NOT MEETING NEEDS WE HAVE. TAKEN THE STEPS THAT YOU REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS MEET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU DEFINED IN THE IN THIS BE -- NINE OH ONE WE ACTUALLY HAVE REQUIRED THOSE ELEMENTS TO BE IN THE PLANTS THAT THEY FILED WITH THIS WHICH WE PLAN TO ADOPT SURELY. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ACTUALLY. BRING MORE STAFF ON TO LOOK AT NEW CAN -- CONSTRUCTION I CAN I CAN ASK POLICE OF THAT -- MALASHENKO OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT TWO TRACTOR TALK ABOUT THAT. I CAN POINT TO THE TO THE WORK WE DID IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN IN TERMS OF BIOMASS FACILITIES. I CAN COMPETE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON TOMORROW I CAN POINT -- TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE MOVING AHEAD ON THE FOR THE THE THAT THIS QUESTION OF SECURITIZATION OF THE LIABILITY BUT THAT IS BETWEEN THE UTILITY AND US AS THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY -- REQUIRED THE UTILITIES THAT IS GOING TO DIRECT THIS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HER WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE DIED HIS PROPERTY JIM DESTROYED AND FIRES. I HAVE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT BECAUSE I AM A REGULATOR WHO WILL TAKE ACTION ON STUFF THAT'S BROUGHT TO US IN FORMAL PROCEEDINGS. I AM STILL WAITING. BECAUSE I CANNOT PRE JUDGE ANYTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD OUTSIDE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE CAMP FIRE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE UP THERE I'VE ALSO VISITED I APPRECIATE THE SERVICE YOU DID FOR CALIFORNIA BY GOING THERE -- I APPRECIATE VERY DEEPLY. BUT MY ROLE AS A REGULATOR REQUIRES ME NOT TO PRE JUDGE THE CAR FAR WE ARE CONTINUING TO REFINE THIS QUESTION OF THE ENERGY IS ATION IT'S A CHALLENGE WE SAW THAT IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS IN SAN DIEGO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S VALUE. HOW DO YOU EXPEDITE THAT WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM WHAT PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEN DIEGO BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CREATE STRESS ON THE SERVICES THAT FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NEED? BY. OVER -- DE ENERGIZING WAR BY G. ENERGIZING FOR TOO LONG WHEN YOU DE ENERGIZE A CIRCUIT. YOU HAVE TO GO LOOK AT EVERY FOR POLL IN EVERY FOOT OF THE WIRES TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THEM ARE DOWN OR DAMAGED WHEN YOU TURN IT BACK ON THAT MEANS THAT THE FASTEST YOU'RE GONNA GET BACK IN SERVICES THIRTY SIX HOURS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A BUSY INTERSECTION IN A COMMUNITY WHERE -- THEY NEED TO HAVE A TRAFFIC LIGHT IF IT'S OUT FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS WHILE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VISIT AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE SERVICES. IT TAKES TIME TO REALLY MAKE THIS CAR KNOW THAT IT'S REQUIRED BUT WE WANT TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLE I SAID ELSEWHERE THAT WE ARE REBUILDING THE PLANE. WALLETS AND FLY YOU GOTTA DO THAT REAL CAREFUL BECAUSE IF YOU CRASH IT. DOESN'T WORK FOR THE FOR RATEPAYERS OF THE OR THE PUBLIC BY STE I STILL AT WHAT ASSURANCE DO I GIVE MY CONSTITUENTS IT IS GOING TO BEAT THAT THAT THINGS ARE GONNA BE SAFER THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW THE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IF I WAS GOING TO GIVE AN ANSWER I'D SAY WE CAN CUT OFF ELECTRICITY TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FIRE HAZARD AREAS BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE PREPARED IN ANY WAY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE ENORMITY OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING SO I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF THE OF THE CAR FIRE. FORTY SIX MILES OVERNIGHT CAUSED BY A FIRE. AT FTA IF GOT CAUGHT FROM A CAR DRAGGING AN AXLE FORTY SIX MILES A THREE MILE HIKE. CLOUT. I CAN'T MIKE I I WHEN I SAY I'M NOT PREPARED I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT. I CAN'T THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY NOT PREPARED THERE MANY THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCOVER THEIR MORE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. I THINK WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT WHAT WE NORMALLY DO THE INSPECTIONS AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE BRINGING MORE PEOPLE ON BUT I GOT TO SAY. WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF THINGS WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. AND SO I'VE LISTED SOME OF THE OUR THEIR TOOLS THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU TO HELP MOVE SOME OF THIS ALONG. BECAUSE I THERE'S AN URGENCY ABOUT. YOU KNOW AND THIS AND YOU KNOW I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I UNDERSTAND SOME OF IT IS YOURS BUT IS SOME OF IT I THINK IS CONCENTRATING ON WHERE WE THINK THE RISK IS HIGHEST RATHER THAN TREATING ALL PIECES OF THE SYSTEM I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE GETTING THAT EXTRA ATTENTION BUT I THINK IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY USE THE RESOURCES WE'VE GOT. IN PLACES WHERE THE BIGGEST RISK IS. ABOUT ASKING FOR A OF LISA HAS ANYTHING SHE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE. I JUST THINK THAT CLIMATE I EVER EXPECTED WE SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO WE NEEDED TO DO ITS STATEWIDE. BUT THOUGH STRENGTHENED FEROCITY THE FIRES WE SAW IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'VE NEVER AND ENCOUNTERED THOSE KINDS OF INTENSE WINDS IN VERY SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. HAS ACTUALLY [inaudible] STARTLED ME. AND I I I I AM GIVING IT EVERYTHING I'VE GOT BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING MORE FROM THEY THINK ARE HELPFUL. I'M LOOKING FOR FRESH EYES ON THIS FROM THE NEW GOVERNOR. THANK YOU IF PART OF MY ANSWERS I HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM BECAUSE IF HE JUST LOOKING AT ME TO STOP. THESEOTHER FIRES TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE FEROCITY OF THE WINDS. I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN DO ALL THAT. THAT THATWASN'T THAT THAT WASN'T WHAT I WAS ASKING OKAY I'M ASKING YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR TOOLS TO HELP MOVE THIS ALONG [inaudible] HOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- THE LEASE IF YOU TO MOTION COULD THE PD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SIXTEEN THE FIRST ONES WITH THE COMMISSION. AND A HOME AT LIKE TO JUST SAY A FEW THINGS HOME ONE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TREES AND WIRES IS NOTHING NEW HELP IS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT'S BEEN HAPPENING. AS LONG AS WE'VE HAD TREES OVERHEAD WIRES THERE'S NO WHAT'S DRIVING THE WILDFIRE CRISIS THAT WE HOME IN CALIFORNIA HERE THAT WHAT'S DRIVING THE CRISIS IS THE CONDITIONS. SURROUNDING -- THE WIRES IN THE TREES THEN LEAD TO MASSIVE WILDFIRES. AND A THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT CONTEXT HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT HELP AND THEN THE LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE OR TREES. ARM AND SO IF WE EXCLUSIVELY JUST KEEP FOCUSING ON MAIN THE CLEARANCES AND HOME TRADITIONAL METHODS WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE LEAPS AND BOUNDS PROGRESS THAT WE NEED. THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED MULTI FOR OF COMPONENTS TO IT CLIMATE CHANGE BEING ONE OF THEM. AND IN TERMS OF TOOLS THAT I NEEDED -- I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE GATHERING -- EXPERTS FROM CROSS OF THESE DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND BEST INNOVATIVE THINKERS IN THE SPACE. AND HOME IT AND HELPING THE L. AND EFFORTS TO HOW OFTEN ACTION PLAN THAT IS NOT JUST FOCUSED. ON ONE COMPONENT OF IT THAT IS PART OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WITH THE WHILE FIGHTS COLLEGE INNOVATION SUMMIT. IS TO BRING EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD FROM FROM AUSTRALIA FROM CANADA OUT FROM OTHER STATES WHO SPECIALIZE IN FIRE WEATHER WE SPECIALIZE IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND THE SPENDING FUELS BEHAVIOR. OMA L. DIFFERENCE IGNITION PREVENTION METHODS IN HERE WHAT ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST MOST INNOVATIVE IDEAS SOMETHING WE HELP WHEN TRIED BEFORE. AND SO IN TERMS OF HOPE A THANK YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO CAN HOPE -- A REALLY EL PUT SOME BEAT BEHIND THIS EFFORTS -- TOGETHER THE BEST MINDS FROM ACADEMIA FROM RESEARCH SCIENCES A TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES FIRE EXPERTS IN UTILITY EXPERTS AND HELP THEM DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSALS THAT THEN CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AT THE STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. I THINK THAT'S HOW WE REALLY MAKE ME LEAPS AND BOUNDS OF PROGRESS BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE JUST KEEP TRYING TO PUSH ON ONE ELEMENTS OF THIS. IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN THE KIND OF TIME THAT WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. THANK YOU WENT ONE FIVE JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABOUT IT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU JOIN US AT OUR FIRE WHILE TECNICA. OR WELFARE TECH GUY -- CONFERENCE BECAUSE I THINK THIS YOU ASKED THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES WE KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN DO AND SHOULD DO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CONVENING THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES. SOME OF WHOM HAVE BETTER INFORMATION BETTER EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF FIRE THAN WE DO. WELL TO TO YOU I DON'T. I WOULD JUST HAVE TO HELP MOVE A JUST YOU MIGHT CONSIDER -- THE COUNTRY OF CHILE. AS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT WHILE WE WERE THERE -- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'VE DONE IT -- DOCTOR DID BUT THEY HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY. TO POINT WHO THEY WANT TO NOTIFY AT A NATIONAL SCALE. SO THEY CAN DO IT THAT WAY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE FINAL THE FINAL THING AND I THINK AND I DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE. FOR IS THE AYE AYE WE MIGHT ONE OF MY CONCERNS I'VE HEARD USE MENTION OVER AND OVER AND TALKING ABOUT RATE PAYERS ANSWERED ABOUT REPAIRS AND SO ON AS WE GO TO IMPLEMENT THESE FIRE PLANS -- THAT WILL BE BORN ON THE BACKS OF RATE PAYERS. BUT AT WHAT POINT. WHERE IS THAT YOU KNOW? YOU WERE WAY IN SAFETY VERSES RATE PAYERS -- YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE WE COULD ERR ON THE SIDE A SAFETY -- RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE. WELL WE TEND. TO S. S. COMMISSIONERS FOCUS ON SAFETY BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT THERE ARE THOSE FOLKS WHO WHO SPEAK TO IN IN OUR PROCEEDINGS WHO HAVE VALID POINTS. SO WE TRIED TO BALANCE THAT NEXT THAT COMES TO THIS QUESTION OF REASONABLE IS WHAT CAN WE REASONABLY DO THAT'S GOING TO CREATE SAFETY WITHOUT UNREASONABLY INCREASING COSTS. SO I THINK THAT THAT ON BALANCE WE HAVE DONE A LOT MORE IN TERMS OF SAFETY THAN WE DID IN IN PREVIOUS YEARS -- I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT PERSONALLY SINCE I GOT TO THE CPUC. BUT I ALSO I ALSO THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WHERE WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY STRONG ON THIS QUESTION IN THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT THE UTILITY DOES IN IN IN IN ADVANCE OF AND DURING BANKRUPTCY. TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER WE THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO ALLOW AND SPEAK TO THAT ALLOW THEM BECOME FINANCE SIMPLE. BECAUSE WITHOUT MONEY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE ON WISE DECISIONS THAT DISADVANTAGED RATE PAYERS THEIR THANK YOU HONEST MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I WANTED. TO CONTINUE THE LINE OF QUESTIONING OF DOCTOR WOULD -- YOU KNOW I READ THE FRONT PAGE ARTICLE FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES FROM JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH -- JUST A FEW DAYS AGO -- QUESTIONING -- WHETHER THE PC -- IS. CAPABLE OF EXERCISING THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT. AND ENFORCEMENT OF OF FOUR WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS. AND TO I I I JUST WANTED. TO QUOTED THROUGH A TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THEY WERE COURTING YOU FAIRLY BUT THE ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE MISTER PICKER. YOU HAD TESTIFIED THAT PERHAPS AT TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS -- IT DOESN'T SPECIFY HERE THAT. TO THAT THE PC IS PRIMARILY AN ECONOMIC REGULATOR WITH THE CENTER FOCUS AND MAKING SURE COMPANIES PROVIDE ENERGY -- AT REASONABLE RATES -- THE AGENCY THAT HAS NEITHER THE TECHNOLOGY NOR MANPOWER TO ENSURE SAFETY COMPLIANCE ON ITS OWN -- AND SO I WILL FIRST OF ALL IT IS IS THAT A FAIR -- ASSESSMENT OF THINK THAT WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO IS THAT OUR PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR REVIEWING UTILITY PERFORMANCE IS NOT. TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDER OF EVERY -- EVERY UTILITY ALIGNMENT OF THAT IN FACT WE DO WHAT MOST STATE AGENCIES TO IN TERMS OF SAFETY WHICH IS THAT WE REQUIRE THEM TO SUBMIT PLANS. REVIEWS REVIEW THOSE PLANS WOULD LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RIGHT KINDS OF CONTROLS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT'S THE CEILING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN WE GO OUT AND AND TO IF AUDIT. AND THEN WE DO SPOT CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE AUDIT TELLS US IS ACTUALLY TRUE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT A RATE MAKING AGENCY DOES AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND HISTORICALLY. I THINK WE ARE INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO BE IN THE FIELD I WILL I WILL JUST ECHO WHAT WHAT -- WHO -- LISA SAID THE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS HE'S A NEW APPROACH DRESSES S. HAZARDS RATHER THAN SIMPLY ENFORCING TO THE CEILING. AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SPEAK TO YA I I'M SURE I SAID THAT AS WELL. IF YOU BUY ME THE ONLY TIME TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE WHOLE QUOTE IN THERE. ALRIGHT SO -- IT'S A FAIR ENOUGH SO SO YOU'RE SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT ARE I THINK YOU YOU THROUGHOUT A NUMBER. THAT TODAY WOULD TAKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND DO STAFF TO BE THAT'S THAT'S A BACK OF THE AREA THE END BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS SURE IS I THINK LISA POINTED OUT. THAT MAY NOT THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING IT PROBABLY NOT ALL THAT WE NEED TO DO AND IT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET. MORE SAFETY FAST WE WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER IN DIFFERENTLY A SUPPOSED TO JUST DOING WHAT WE DO MORE AND BETTER I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE AND OKAY -- FAIR ENOUGH AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT YOU BEEN EMPHASIZING THIS WATER FOR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN ITS RIGHT PLACE IT WHETHER WE CAN LEARN AND WE CAN BRING OUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THE AUSTRALIANS ARE IN SOME RESPECTS CLOSEST TO US. IN ALL AT LEAST THE KIND OF TALK ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM BUT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES ALL OVER SHOULD THAT'S WHY -- WHEN WHEN? I SAY THAT I THAT I I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS AND OTHER PEOPLE BRING FOR WE'RE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS THE AUSTRALIANS ARE GOING THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN -- FOR MAKING. THESE ARE LARGER TRENDS THAN ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE BEFORE TO IMPORTANT TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING SO WE CAN ADOPT DEBT. BUT IT'S HARD TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER HERE TODAY YES LAND AND AND SO I APPRECIATE HOW YOU ARE -- LOOKING FOR A BEST PRACTICES -- AND AND AND FOR BETTER SOLUTIONS -- GOT IT TO OTHER STATES BUT YOU KNOW I WHAT WANTED ASK I MEAN AND IN THE SAME ARTICLE SAYS THAT. CURRENTLY A TEAM OF NINETEEN PEOPLE AT THE P. YOU SEE. A CONDUCTS ON THE GROUND PREVENTION SAFETY AUDITS SPOT CHECKS WHILE ALSO INVESTIGATING WHAT FIRES I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT ADDING MORE STAFF BUT THE HOW MANY MORE STAFF ARE WE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] WE SO THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE TO A CURRENT STAFFING L. WITH WE HAVE DONE TODAY ACTUALLY IS ISSUED THE RULING AT THE COMMISSION. TO BRING ON SOME ADDITIONAL. CONTRACTORS OUT TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL WORK IN THE FIELD. ELM. AND WILL BE SCALED TO AND L. ACTUAL PHYSICAL ABILITY TO PERFORM THE KIND OF WORK IS THAT VARIOUS LIMITATIONS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN BRING ON HOW FAST AND FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE. BUT WE WILL BE THROUGH A CONTRACTING MECHANISM INCREASING -- THE MOUNT OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND THE JUST PEOPLE WHO HEALTH PATROLLING LINES OF THE DISTANCE OF THE WORK THE UTILITIES ARE DOING JUST TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT. ADDITIONAL -- ASSURANCE AND SUPPLEMENTS ARE STAFF BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. NINE TWO PEOPLE IS NOT GOING TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE SO HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. ELM THE THE DETAILS OF THAT WILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT ELAM AS WE RAMP UP THIS PROJECT BUT IT'S AN UP AS PRESIDENT PICK A SAID. I THINK IN THE ORDER OF OVER A HUNDRED HOME. STAFF IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE FEASIBLE AGAIN THROUGH THIS THROUGH THE L.. CONTRACTING MECHANISM BUT THE AT AND THAT'S STILL NOT. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE PATROLLING EVERY MILE OF LINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT ALL TIMES. SO IT STILL ONLY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL OWN ABILITY TO INSPECT BUT THAT THE A JUST ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE EXPECTATION A SAID THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PATROLLING EVERY EVERY MILE. BUT WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE WILDFIRE MAPS AND WE HAVE THE WILD FOR MITIGATION PLANS UTILITIES ARE FILING WE CAN USE THAT AS A AS A WAY TO TO TO ACTUALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN. TO PICK THE GREATEST HAZARDS SO WE KNOW THAT AS WE GET THROUGH THIS FIRST ROUND OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN IMPLEMENT ENTERED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WILL LEARN SOMETHING AND WILL PROBABLY COME BACK AND APPLY THAT NEXT YEAR IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE HAVE THIS YEAR. SO THIS IS THIS IS GONNA BE UNFORTUNATELY -- DRIVEN BY WHAT WE CAN LEARN HOW QUICKLY CAN OR NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO THOSE THINGS ARE AFFECTED WE ACT AS A SAID. WE COULD DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT SOME OF THEM PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS IMPORTANT THIS THING SO THAT WE DO THAT WORK I I GET I GUESS MY BASIC POINT IS THAT YOU KNOW. I AM CONCERNED THAT WHILE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THESE WHAT FOR MITIGATION PLANS THROUGH SB NINE A ONE IN THE THAT. THAT IF IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT AND WE WE OFTEN SEE THAT TO YOU KNOW THE LAWS THAT WE PASS ARE MEANINGLESS UNLESS THEY'RE ENFORCED. AND YOU KNOW. IT'S THE STATE I I IMAGINE ACCORDING TO YOUR YOUR ANNUAL REPORT THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF COURSE IS NOT JUST SURVEYING THE OVER TWO AND A FEW THOUSAND MILES OF OF OF POWER LINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S ALSO. SUPPOSED TO BE MONITORING OUR OR GAS FACILITIES AND AND AND AND THE LONG LIST OF RARE ROSE -- LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT HIGHWAY -- AND YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS NEW ABNORMAL OF THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE HERE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T. WE LIKE THE ARTICLE TALKS ABOUT I MEAN DO WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT NEW MODELS OF RATHER THAN JUST ADDING CONTRACTORS TO THE PC OF ME DOES THE PC. I HAVE TOO MUCH ON HIS PLATE THAT WE NEEDED A NEW SPECIAL AGENCY TO FOCUS ON ON WHAT FAR SAFETY AND MAIN. A MAIN TO I I THINK WE NEED -- YOU KNOW WE WE NEED YOUR ADVICE -- YOU KNOW -- CRISIS THIS NEW ABNORMAL THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. WELL THESE ARE ALL REAL GOOD QUESTIONS BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF OUR DIRECT ROLE SO. I THINK THAT IS A STATEWIDE WARNING SYSTEM IS A GREAT IDEA WE TALKED A TO THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES DO THAT WE DON'T DO BORING EXIT THE CPUC NOR DO I THINK THE UTILITIES ARE THE BEST PEOPLE TO DO WARNINGS. WE HAVE TO GET MORE COOPERATION FROM THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES THEY HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE THE DATA ON THAT. PARTICULAR HAZARD AND OTHER HAZARDS I'D IN A I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT. FOR AND I CAN SAY THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE STAFF WHO DO SOME OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU RAISED AND YOU CAN TALK TO THE TO THE OTHER STAFF THAT WE HAVE -- DO OTHER HAZARDS YEAH JUST WHAT THE COMMENTS ON THE ON THE STAFF AUGMENTATION THIS IS BY NO MEANS. THE SOLUTION TO THE WELFARE CRISIS. EITHER WE NEED SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM -- EFFORTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OF THIS STAFF AUGMENTATION IS A RESPONSE. TO THE TO THE IMMEDIATE NEED TO HAVE MORE EYES ON THE GROUND -- AND WE CAN GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT AS ABOUT WORK L. HAPPENS SB NINE NO ONE ANTICIPATED THE THIRD IN THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY TO COME IN AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF UTILITIES. IT WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION SET UP IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATE WE HAVE DECIDED THAT WE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. THAT IS WHY WE'RE JUST BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL PEOPLE OF SOCKS FAST AS WE CAN JUST TO HOLD BECAUSE WE CAN DO MORE WITH THE HUNDRED THAT WE CAN DO WITH THE NINETEEN RIGHT AS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THESE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT CAN INVOLVE. A YOU KNOW A SINGLE KINDS OF PAST WEATHER IS CREATING NEW AND CITIES OR OF MEN SAYING -- ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS I THINK -- YEAH. THAT SEGMENT AND THIS MAY SEND AN UPBEAT AND KIND OF ON THE SAME LINES OF OF DOCTOR WOULD -- AND AND I'VE SAID FOR YEARS I THINK WE ASK YOU TO DO I MEAN WE WE PILE THINGSON AND THEN GET ANGRY WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK OUT -- DO YOU AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND LOOKING IMPORTANT. BUT IN YOUR PLANNING PROCESSES AND AND FROM THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS DO YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE. I DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE I MEAN CALIFORNIA IS A BIG STATE WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT TERRAIN AND DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS AND DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE. IN YOUR IN YOUR ROLE DO YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE AS NIMBLE AS AS YOU NEED TO BE AND IF YOU'RE NOT WHAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. SO. I WILL SAY THAT I DON'T AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE DIDN'T THINK THAT THE CPUC WAS THE MOST NIMBLE. OR EVEN TIMELY. AGENCY AND WE WERE DESIGNED DIFFERENT -- ERA. WHEN THINGS DIDN'T MOVE QUICKLY AND WE WERE DESIGNED FOR ANY ERA WHERE EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A SPECIALTY COURT? SO I USE IT WE WERE. REALLY DOES SORT OF SET UP IS A SPECIALTY COURT TO KEEP A LOT OF THESE RATE MAKING ISSUES OUT OF THE THE THE THE STATE COURT SYSTEM. AND SOMEBODY WHO HAD EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I'VE WE CAME EARLY TO THE LEGISLATURE SEEKING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE OUR OVERALL PROCESSES. AND TO BE USED THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS WE DO ADJUDICATORY OR FORTUNES FOR VIOLATIONS. OF WE DO WHAT WE CALL OUR RATE SETTING FOR IN THAT'S THE BULK OF WHAT WE DO FOR THINGS THAT INVOLVE COSTS AND THEN WE DO. ANOTHER SET OF HEARINGS THAT -- FOCUS ON ON ON WHAT'S A LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES WERE IMPLEMENTING. I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AND CAUSE A LEGISLATIVE WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH IN TERMS REFORMING US IN TERMS OF THOSE PROCESSES. SO THE LEGISLATURE. DID ALSO MAKE THE JOB IN SOME RESPECTS A LITTLE HARDER BECAUSE THE EX PARTE REQUIREMENTS SOMETIMES MAKE IT HARDER TO ACTUALLY HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE FREELY. AND GET INFORMATION AS A COMMISSIONER SO YOU ELY MORE ON BUILDING THAT RECORD VERY PAINSTAKINGLY THAT'S THE TRANSPARENCY THAT WE TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT NOTION OF TRANSPARENCY -- BUT FOR US TRANSPARENCY IS DO YOU HAVE A RECORD PUBLISHED RECORD THAT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO WHICH IS WHAT YOU USE TO MAKE A DECISION. SO SOMETIMES I SEE THINGS RAYNAUD THINGS BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE RECORD I CAN'T DEPEND ON THAT TO MAKE A DECISION. THESE THINGS ARE REALLY HARD TO DO IN THE FACE OF PATH OF OF OF FAST PACED KNOWLEDGE IS THE CAN INNOVATE VERY QUICKLY SO WE CAN TAKE US A COUPLE YEARS TO GET UP ON TO SPEED. ON THINGS LIKE BATTERY STORAGE DURING WHICH TIME BATTERY STORAGE IS REALLY MOVING MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN OUR PROCESSES AND THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROCESSES ALLOW US TO BECAUSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG NUMBERS. AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY SPEND THE RIGHT MONEY ON THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGIES OR WE DON'T OVERSPEND OR THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NUMBERS. THESE ARE ALL HIGHLY LITIGATED THAT I THINK IS A CORE ISSUE. IF YOU WANT AN AGENCY THAT CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY. MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF AGENTS IF YOU WANT AN AGENCY THAT DOES WHAT THE COURT DOES WHICH IS BALANCES THE EVIDENCE THAT COMES INTO THE RECORD. AND BALANCES THE WORDS VERY CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SPECIFIC OUTCOMES OF FAIRNESS AND WE'RE GOOD AT THAT. BUT IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUICK. SECOND BE QUICK THAT IN TURN MEANS THAT TO DO THESE THINGS ON SAFETY WE HAVE COME UP WITH REALLY DIFFERENT WAYS OF APPROACHING THINGS. SO WE'VE TRIED A LOT OF THESE THINGS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE WORKED PRETTY WELL BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY RETURN TO HIS WILD FOR CONFERENCE. IT'S A WAY TO BRING A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THAT ALL THE PARTIES WHO COME TO US IN A PROCEEDING WOULD NEVER BRING TO US. AND SO WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH THOSE THINGS JUSTICE NEWER TO US AND IT REQUIRES US TO STRETCH TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT STUFF THAT'S WHY I THINK. THAT -- LISA HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ADDITION TO THE ORGANIZATION WHICH BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SHE'S VERY FAMILIAR WITH HOW YOU KEEP PACE AND AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION BECAUSE SHE DID A LOT OF WORK AND IT. SO. IT'S IT'S A STRUGGLE AND THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS WE DISPLAY THIS. WE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO REALLY BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW ADAPT TECHNOLOGY WERE COURT WORK COURT WE NEED TO HAVE COURT ROOMS AND LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO SEEN DIEGO. ALL OUR COURTROOMS IN THE BAY AREA. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE CAN'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS OUTSIDE OF THE BAY AREA'S IS VERY HARD FOR US TO GET THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS TO TO ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT WE'RE DOING. ANY AND TO KEEP AN EYE ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR DEFINITION OF TRANSPARENCY THEY WERE BUILDING A RECORD AND WERE USING THAT TO FRAME OUR DECISION. SELL EITHER A YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THESE ARE ALL THINGS I SAID A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- ABOUT THE THREE PHARMACY PSA -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- THAT THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK BROUGHT UP FOR KIND OF CHALLENGING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID HIS REQUIRE TO TREAT AUTOMATICALLY ANY -- BANKER INVESTOR FINANCE -- FOR ME TO GO OUT AND AND EXACT WHAT THE IN THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING SO THAT I CAN REALLY INTERPRET. TRULY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND PRINT VERSUS WHAT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING FOR SO I HAVE TO DO THAT THROUGH. A STAFF WHO CAN TALK TO THEM SO THESE ARE THESE ARE ALSO CHALLENGES BUT IT'S IT'S USEFUL IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ACCESS TO ME. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR POINT OF VIEW. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS HERE EITHER AND I DO WE ASKED TO TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE DO. USED TO HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WENT OUT WITH THE CHP OFFICER EVERY DAY TO INSPECT COMMERCIAL TRUCKING [inaudible] WELL. THAT THERE'S TREES BEEN DEREGULATED FOR INTERSTATE PURPOSES AND IT'S ALL INTERSTATE. SO ALL WE HAD WAS -- MOVING VANS THE LEGISLATURE DID TAKE INTERSTATE MOVING VANS AWAY FROM US BUT WHEN HE LEFT US WITH. VERY COMPLICATED NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE VERY DEMANDING AND VERY COMPLICATED IF YOU THINK THAT. THAT REPORTS OF RECENT DEMONSTRATORS DISRUPTING OUR HEARINGS OR ANYTHING WE HAD TAXI DRIVERS IN SAN FRANCISCO SURROUNDING OUR BUILDING AT HAWKING BECAUSE THEY WANT US TO KILL THE THE THE LIFT AND UBER COMPANIES. THAT SELL -- THIS IS NOT EASY THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE DESIRE TO DO THAT. IN PART BECAUSE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE GIVES US A TASK. IT SETS A STATEWIDE MARK. VERSUS A BUNCH OF DISCRETE MARKETS AROUND SAY SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU TOLD US THAT WE WERE GOING TO REGULATE THE CABLE COMPANIES. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY TO TELL THEM TO DO ANYTHING. BUT THEY COME IN EVERY YEAR THEY GIVE US A FORM THEY GIVE US INTO A SMALL FEE TO FILE. AND THEN THEY'RE NOT REGULATED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAND FOR MOST PART NOT BY US. SO THERE YOU COULD PULL SOME OF THAT AWAY -- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE UP ALL CONTROL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. CELL DEEZER DEEZER CHOICES THAT ARE TOUGH TO MAKE WE CAN'T MAKE YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. IMPORT QUESTIONS THOUGH -- THAT -- WE'RE GONNA TURN TO MISS RAMOS -- BURKE. AND THEN MISTER PATTERSON AND THEN WE'LL WRAP UP AND MOVE -- TO MISS ECHOLS AND GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY MAKER PRESENTATION. AND THEN WE'LL WRAP IT FOR THE DAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I THINK IS I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON DR EGGMAN'S COMMENTS -- I THINK WHAT SHOULD BE CLEAR SO WE DON'T WANT YOU TO FAIL. THERE THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE -- AS DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED TOO MANY LIVES THAT DEPEND ON THE ACTIONS. OF THE P. C.. UP. AND IF WHAT WE ARE DOING. WHETHER TO SB NINE A ONE IS MORE THAN CAN BE HANDLED. WE WANT THINGS TAKEN CARE OF THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS AT THEIR HOUSE TO BE AGAIN HONEST DIALOGUE YOUR WEEK ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. IT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN NINE A ONE WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY MEASURES HARDENING THE GRANT ENSURING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MITIGATION PLANS THAT THAT WERE MANDATING AND TO DO YOU ARE YOU ABLE TO TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND DO YOU HAVE THE STAFF TO TAKE CARE OF THAT WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED. UP AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING IN -- BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES -- DOCTOR WOULD TALKS ABOUT CHILE WE HEAR ABOUT AUSTRALIA. IF IF WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG. THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. A WAY. TO DO THIS MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE WE HAVE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE ON THIS PATH -- ONE DOCTOR WOULD TALKS ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN. I I I DO RECALL. WHEN WE HAD THE SB NINE A ONE HEARINGS AND THAT WAS PART OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED? YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING IS IS PASSED WE SAY THIS IS THE NEW REGULATION. AND WE HEARD ABOUT THE FACT THAT TAKES EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT THIS. THAT'S FRUSTRATING AND THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE TO AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES. THAT ISN'T A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER BUT WE ALSO AS DOCTOR EGGMAN SAID WE CAN'T JUST. SO WHAT ALL ON YOU AND EXPECT YOU TO TO HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. IN THE END DURING THE HEARINGS AS WELL I ALSO SAID AND I I WAS. AS A FRESHMAN I SAID TO YOU THEN. IF THERE IS LEGISLATION THAT YOU WANT FROM US THE YOU NEED THAT WE FOR US TO PASS DOCTOR QUIRK HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT AS WELL. TELL US WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS WITH YOU WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT IN THE END WE WORKED TOGETHER FOR SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN TO DOCTOR WOULD INTO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE HAD THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WE NEED TO FIND THE ANSWERS FOR THEM. THANK YOU AYE I THINK THAT I'VE SAID THAT WE MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY ON SOME OF THE ELEMENTS IN SB NINE ONE PARTICULARLY THE WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR MOVING QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLKS TO GO OUT AND SURE THAT THERE'S COMPLIANCE WITH THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT. THE STANDARDS THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IN THE STANDARDS THE YOU ARE REQUIRING US TO IT HERE TO IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING SB. NINE ONE MAY NOT BY THEMSELVES BE ENOUGH WE WE I THINK WE CAN DO THOSE I THINK WE CAN GET BETTER AT THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT IT. BUT THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS ARE WHAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER AS A CEILING. WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO GO BEYOND THAT. AND SO THAT'S PART OF OUR COMMITMENT IS THAT WE'RE QUESTIONING OURSELVES. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WHILE IT SB NINE ONE IS IMPORTANT ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M EAGER THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ACTUALLY CONVENING THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE WILL ALL LEARN BETTER AS WE SHARE INFORMATION WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH CALLOW WE US IN WITH. WITH -- WITH CAL FIRE. THEY UNDERSTAND FIRES. WE UNDERSTAND RATE MAKING. WE UNDERSTAND PROCESS LISA VADA HAS ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO LEARN. I THINK THAT BRINGING THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY INTO THE DISCUSSION BRINGING SOME OF THE OTHER STAGE TO THE DISCUSSION WILL HELP US ALL TO GET TO BETTER SOLUTIONS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING. AND THAT'S WHAT MY MESSAGES IS THE WE NEED MORE WE NEED MORE THINKING WE NEED MORE IDEAS BECAUSE I'M JUST AFRAID THAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A CEILING. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH WE NEED HOW TALL WE HAVE TO BE. TO ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE THESE CHANGING CONDITIONS. SOME ARE BURKE. SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE TO BUILD A QUESTION WHICH AND I AND AND BUT ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES QUESTION WHICH IS. I'M NOT TOTALLY UNDERSERVED UNDERSTANDING WHY WERE REINVENTING THE WHEEL I MEAN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WORDS MEAN OR WE DON'T KNOW FOR MANAGEMENT AND VEGETATION MANAGER. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE ISN'T A STRONGER PARTNERSHIP OR WHY YOU'RE THE ONLY AND STEVE. APPROVAL. FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WHY ISN'T THERE MORE WORK WITH CAL FIRE OR ONE OF OUR OTHER AGENCIES THAT ALREADY HAS EXPERIENCE IN AND I'M. AND AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE OF WILD CARD TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE WHO IS PROBABLY BETTER ADAPTED AND BETTER ABLE TO EVEN TAKE IN THAT INFORMATION FROM THAT CONFERENCE. TO BE WORKING WITH YOU TIME TO LOOK AT THOSE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. AND MY SECOND. QUESTION SLASH COMMENT IS -- WE'VE SPENT ON THE TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT AND I KNOW DOCTOR BURKE MENTIONED BRIEFLY AND THE CHAIR ISSUES AND I KNOW WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO THINK THAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES AND MEANWHILE CALPERS LOST SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. CAL STAR IS OFF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR INVESTMENT DIRECTLY OVER THE LAST MONTH AS A RESULT OF THESE DOWNGRADES. AND MIKE I AM CONCERNED AND THE SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION IS IS THAT THE PC DID COME TO THIS BODY -- IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS AS FAR AS A LIABILITY OR CONCERN LAST YEAR. AND AS YOU LOOK AT NINE A ONE I HEAR YOU KEEP SAYING THAT LED MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MY QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION. DIDN'T WHY DID NINE OH ONE NOT GIVE YOU TO PROVIDE THE MARKET THE STABILITY IT IT NEEDS AND IF THAT IS PART OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE HEARD. FOR THOSE OF US WHO TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY LONG WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOUR FIFTY ONE POINT ONE WHETHER IT'S A MAYOR SHALL OR WHAT DID YOU NOT GET. THAT WILL PROVIDE NOT JUST THAT NOT JUST THE I'LL USE BUT THOSE WHO INVESTED IN WHICH OUR TEACHERS AND STATE WORKERS. ALL THE STABILITY IN THEIR RETIREMENT OR WHETHER THAT IS RATE PAYERS. TAKING ON THAT BIRD AND WE ARE AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A STATE TAKING ON THAT BIRD AND NOW. AND WE STARTED LAST YEAR BUT IT HAS CONTINUED. AND WHETHER IT IS BANKRUPTCY OR SAFETY FIRST WE ARE TAKING ON THAT BURDEN AND I AM GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU NEED FROM US. TO MITIGATE THAT DAMAGE TO SOCIALIZE THAT THAT COST. THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN OR WERE NOT GIVEN AND I KNOW WHAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS POPULAR IN I'M NOT STATING A POSITION. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY WANTS INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM. INVERSE CONDEMNATION ISN'T REALLY A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE UTILITY DID SOMETHING RIGHT OR DID SOMETHING WRONG. IT'S A STRICT LIABILITY PROVISION AND IT MAKES THEM THE FIRST PAY ARE EVEN BEFORE THE SOME OF THE INSURERS. FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE CAUSED BY THEIR QUITMAN. AT THE END OF THE PROCESS AFTER THEY SETTLED ALL THOSE CLAIMS SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS LATER. THEY'LL COME TO US AND SAY OKAY WE ACTED IS THE FIRST PAYER WE KEPT US OUT OF BED OUT OUT OF THE COURTS WE JUST DID IT THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS LIKE ABOUT THE THESE KINDS OF STRICT LIABILITY PROVISIONS. NOW WE NEED TO PASS THOSE COSTS ALONG TO RATE PAYERS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE UTILITY IS BEING FAIR AND REASONABLE. IN THEIR IN THEIR THEIR REQUEST THAT WE ALLOW THEM TO TO TAKE. MONEY IN IN FROM RATE PAYERS AND SO WE WE THEN APPLY A PRUDENT SEE TEST AND THE QUESTION IS DID YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO. AND SO THAT. THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION FIRST AND FOREMOST IN MOST FREQUENTLY IS WHAT -- THE THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY SAYS THEY WANT. BEYOND THAT THEY'VE SAID THEY WILL THEY HAVE WON A NUMBER. THEY ONE AND OUT THIS MUCH IN NO MORE IS GONNA GO TO SHAREHOLDERS. AND THE I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. THE UTILITIES CAN HAVE TO PAY. RIGHT AND JUST SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE. AND I UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE ON WE ALL KNOW THAT THE UTILITIES AND THE INVESTORS WOULD LOVE THE REMOVAL OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WE ARE ONE OF THE LAST FEW STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS IT. HOWEVER -- YOU KNOW YOU CAME TO US ASKING. FOR A DEFINITION OR AN UNDERSTANDING ON LIABILITY AND WHAT DO YOU WHAT AND TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THAT SPACE MY QUESTION IS DID YOU GET IT IN NINE OH ONE AND WHAT PART OF NINE A ONE DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT. SO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NINE A ONE IS THAT WE SHOULD USE OUR STANDARD PROCESSES AND IN WITHIN THAT DO A STRESS TEST AND THEN -- FROM THAT -- GO OUT AND TO BE A PLAYER REASONABLENESS TEST. UP TO A POINT AFTER THE STRESS TEST AND ALL THOSE COSTS GO TO RATE PAYERS. SO WHEN WE STILL BELIEVE. AS A AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT YOUR INTENTION WAS THAT WE WOULD WAIT UNTIL ALL THE COSTS WERE IN. BEFORE WE PERFORM THAT STRESS TEST AND ALLOWED THAT SECURITIZATION. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BEGIN TO RECOVER THE EXCESS COSTS ABOVE AND BEYOND WITH THE UTILITY COULD AFFORD. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT THAT'S IT'S GOING TO BE CONTROVERSIAL EVEN AT THAT THAT'S THE PORTION THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE OTHER STUFF WE DID FASTER. THE OTHER STUFF STUFF THAT WE THOUGHT WAS DIRECTLY APPLICABLES TO SAFETY WE DID. THIS IS ABOUT OUR TRADITIONAL RATE MAKING WORK* WERE CONTINUING TO RELY ON WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD WAS YOUR INTENT OKAY. I CAN ON TO THAT A LITTLE BIT -- EVER RAND OFF -- DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY -- BECAUSE THE COMMISSIONERS BECAUSE OF X. PART PARTY RULES HAVE -- DIFFICULTIES MEETING WITH THE RATING AGENCIES WE SET UP A PROCESS WHERE WE WILL PERIODICALLY MEET WITH THE RATING AGENCIES -- IT'S IMPORTANT THE RATING AGENCIES UNDERSTAND -- WHAT THE KIND OF THE REGULATORY THINKING OF OF VERY STATES ARE -- YES THEY BEFORE THE CAMPFIRE COMMUNICATED TO US THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO DAM WAS TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN THE STRESS TEST WAS RUN WHAT? NOT NECESSARILY THE NUMBER WOULD BE BUT WHAT. THE CRITERIA THAT WE WOULD USE TO DETERMINE THAT NUMBER TO GO BACK TO THE STATUTE. THIS STATUTE IS I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDS BUT IS -- VERY STATUTORILY WRITTEN AND ITS LACK OF CLARITY IS NOT CLEAR ON ON WHERE THAT THAT THAT STRESS TESTS WHERE IT BEGINS WHERE IT AND EIGHT YEAH WHERE WHERE IT GOES AND SO. WE DID EXACTLY WHAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY WAS ASKING FOR AT THAT TIME -- WHICH IS TO SAY OPEN A PROCEEDING THAT WE WE THOUGHT WE STILL THINK WE CAN DO IN A FAIRLY QUICK PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS TO SAY. HERE'S THE CRITERIA WE WOULD USE WHEN WE APPLY A STRESS TEST -- WHAT WE SAID IN AND I THINK THE BEST WE CAN IS A WHOLE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AT THE TIME IT? WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO APPLY I NUMBER. THEN ISN'T USED UNTIL THE UTILITY COMES FORWARD SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW WITH AN APPLICATION TO RECOVER THE FUNDS. AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATIONS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT -- AND MAYBE THEY COULD THEN AFFORD TO PAY MORE MAYBE THEY CAN AFFORD DIFFERENCE YOU DON'T WANNA SET A NUMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR A DECISION YOU'RE GONNA BE MAKING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE BUT YOU CAN SET THE CRITERIA SO THEY KNOW THAT -- THE FIELD CHANGED A LOT AFTER THE CAMPFIRE -- IN THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT NINE OH ONE DEALT WITH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES DIFFERENTLY THAN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES. IN. SOMEONE EVER QUIRK TO YOUR POINT EARLIER. IT'S NOT SO MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING IF YOU GO LOOK AT P. GENIES FILINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT YESTERDAY AND THE DECLARATIONS OF THEIR CFO -- OF WHAT THEY WERE POINTING TO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THE P. YOU SEE. WOULD BE UNABLE TO DO THE STRESS TEST IN A IN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD IT'S AT THE P. YOU SEE WOULD BE UNABLE TO GIVE THEM THE AUTHORIZATION. TO GO OUT AND BORROW MONEY. HEARD THE RATE PAYER BACK TERMS OF NINE A ONE AND I'VE GONE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND READ NINE A ONE AND I JUST DON'T SEE. THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE COULD STATION THAT ACCESS TO CASH. WELL. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN THE PAST THAT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT. YOU DID TAKE CARE OF IT IN THE CASE OF SAN BRUNO AND YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF IT NOW THANK YOU. IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS I THINK MAYBE WE AT THAT CHAIR HOLD MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS THAT LATER ON BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS. BUT THEN. THE QUESTION THEN OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE SAID IN THEIR PUBLIC COMMENTS ON WHY THEY'VE SET THE VARIOUS UTILITIES WHERE THEY ARE -- IN WHERE THEIR UNCERTAINTIES ARE IT'S NOT ONE FACT. IT'S NOT THE P. YOU SEE -- MOVING SLOWLY ON THE STRESS TEST APPLICATION -- IT'S NOT -- AT NINE A ONE HAVING WITH THE TERM OF ART THAT'S BEEN USED OUT THERE IS THE DONUT HOLE FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT'S THE BALANCE OF ALL THE FACTORS BUT THEN THE BIG ISSUE FOR ALL OF THEM WHEN THEY GO FORWARD. IS. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO I ABILITY FROM THE WILD FIRES. THERE'S STILL THE QUESTION OF IS THE UTILITY AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT SOME OTHER FORM OF COST RECOVERY OTHER THAN UTILITY OR UTILITY RIGHT PAIR -- THEY DON'T SEE THE UTILITY IS A GOING FORWARD MODEL I MEAN SO YOU KNOW WE COULD FIX INVERSE COMBINATION -- FAR WE COULD PASS ALL OF THE COST ON THE RATE PAYERS FOR EVERY WILD FIRE. AND I THINK WALL STREET STILL GONNA SAY THIS IS STILL NOT INVESTABLE BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE ARE GONNA -- DO IT -- YEAH THAT'S SIMILAR PATTERSON HIS SUGGESTED -- IS THEY'RE JUST GONNA STOP USING ELECTRICITY FROM THE GRID BECAUSE IT WON'T BE AFFORDABLE I'M SO IT'S THAT BALANCE OF THINGS THAT ALL OF THESE AGENCIES IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES ARE SAYING NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IT'S LIKE THEY NEED A SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY METHOD YEAH. YEAH AND THERE I SUMMER SAY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN VERSE COMBINATION FIX BUT I DON'T SEE YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT AS THE ONLY IF IT'S REALLY THE COMFORT COPPER YEAH. I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE ARTICULATE BECAUSE HE CAN ACTUALLY TALK TO PEOPLE. I HEAR IT THIRD HAND. FOR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO THAT AND I DON'T WANT IT CREATED THE BLUE RIBBON PANEL OR COMMISSION THAT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE FOCUSES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY AND GOING FORWARD AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S NOW APPOINTED THREE MEMBERS OF THE FIVE MEMBER. PANEL AND I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER IN THE PRO TEM AS WELL SO. THAT GROUP AND I THINK THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE UP AND OPERATING. A SOONER THAN LATER MEMBER BURKE HAS BROUGHT BROUGHT FOR IN AGAIN I THINK THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. DEALING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S UP. DO STRIKE FORCED ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE TAKING ON WORKING WITH THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES WILL ACTUALLY HELP US TO GAIN UNDERSTANDING BETTER FASTER. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INSURANCE AGENCY. AND SELF THAT PART OF IT IS A RISK POOL OR SOME OTHER VEHICLE. THAT'S NOT GONNA COME FROM US GOT IT -- MISTER PATTERSON YOUR CLOTHES OUT ON THE QUESTIONS -- AND THEN IF WE JUST IT IS YEAH CIRCLES IF YOU COULD. IF YOU'RE STILL HERE OWNER. APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY -- BUT IF YOU CAN START MAKING YOUR WAY FORWARD NOT I DO NOT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW THIS IS RATHER BROAD QUESTION BUT I WANT TO KIND OF DISTILLED WE'VE BEEN HERE TWO HOURS HEARING -- EVERYONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING -- THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE. ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS THAT WE HAVE THE DOWNGRADES THAT AFFECT THE COST OF CAPITAL -- THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY P. G. ANY AND BANKRUPTCY BUT WE HAVE OTHER. UTILITIES OF SIGNIFICANT SIZE. A TERRIBLY STRESSED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO. THE ASPIRATION FOR SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. HOW IS HAT ASPIRATION REACHED WITH THESE COMPLICATING CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS THEY WORK ENTIRELY AT ODDS WITH THE GOALS? HERE -- WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO FRANKLY IF YOU RECALL TWO THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. HOW THE UTILITIES WERE IN A DEATH SPIRAL TOP SOLAR UNF ANYBODY REMEMBERS THAT? UTILITIES ARE STILL HERE RATES ARE STILL AFFORDABLE TO THOSE ROOFTOP SOLAR COMPANIES ARE BANKRUPT. A SOLAR CITY AND IN SENATORS SO. I I THINK THAT WE ST WE STRUGGLE LONG WE DO WHAT WE DO TO THE BEST THE THAT WE CAN'T INSURE THEIR RATE PAYERS -- ARE DONE WE DON'T CONTROL RELIABILITY ALONE WE I AM MEET MONTHLY WITH. WITH THE C. C. AND THE I SO JUST TO TRACK. TRANSPACIFIC -- THING SO WE NEED TO DO THAT WE CAN DO WE ARE STAFFS MADE ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS TO TRACK THESE THINGS WE IDENTIFY SPECIAL PROBLEMS LIKE THE CHALLENGES OF OF NATURAL GAS IN IN IN IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF SEVERAL MAJOR PIPE POINTS. WE MONITOR WE TAKE AMERICA WE TAKE WHATEVER ACTIONS SEEM APPROPRIATE NERVE VALUABLE TO US I CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME TAKING THE CASE OF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS. OR I COULD USE THE SAME KINDS OF FACTS BUT NATION AS TO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WHEN SANTA NO FOR NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION DROPPED OUT OF THE GRID SUDDENLY. LEAVING A BIG HOLE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF OUR GENERATION BUT IN TERMS OF THE REACTIVE POWER YOU NEED TO GET ELECTRICITY FLOWING BACK AND FORTH. UP AND DOWN THAT SECTION OF THE COAST THERE'S A LEVEL AT WHICH YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO -- THAT ARE BASED ON TEN YEARS OUT AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU DO THAT ARE BASED ON THE NEXT THREE MONTHS [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET ME JUST SAY WE WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU COMING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THESE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF CLEARLY THERE'S A BACKDROP OF ISSUES THAT ARE -- THAT ARE VERY PRESSING IN CREATING A LOT OF ANXIETY AND STRESS NOT. ONLY WITHIN THIS CAPITAL COMMUNITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS YOUR YOUR ATTENTION TO A REGULATORY AGENCIES DETAIL OVER THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT -- WE ADDRESS TODAY AND THE RANGE OF OF CLARITY AND WHICH YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT THEM AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM -- IT IS A WE ALSO RECOGNIZE TO THAT -- THERE MAY BE SOME -- HANKS IN TERMS OF SOME IT IT -- BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT FROM. WERE IN A CERTAIN HAPPENED WE GET THAT -- WE WILL PUSH BACK WHEN WE FEEL THAT THERE NEEDS TO AND I THINK WE WERE RUBBING UP AGAINST HIS AREAS WHERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TRANSITION TO SOME [inaudible] OTHER. STRUCTURE OR SOME OTHER REVIEWS IT NEEDS TO BE CORPORATE IN THIS. THAT -- DOES ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RESPONSIVENESS AND TIMELY WAY -- BUT I AM COMPELLED TO TELL ALSO -- UNDERSTANDING HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE DELIBERATE NATURE OF A COURT PROCEEDING AND MAKING SURE THAT. ALL THE I'S ARE DOTTED AND TEASE ACROSS IT IT MAY BE A BIT FRUSTRATING AS WERE MAKING OUR WAY THROUGH THESE OF SOMETIMES CHALLENGING ISSUES BUT LONG TERM -- IT IS BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION UNDER US FOR A VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS SO. THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WILL CONTINUE -- WE MAY CALL YOU BACK OUTSIDE OF THIS FLOOR AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT. THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO OUT THERE AND LEARN. OF FROM WHAT OTHER AGENCIES AND COUNTRIES AND STATES ARE DOING. WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH -- THE IMPACTS OF CATASTROPHIC. EVENTS WILDFIRES OR OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS THAT WOULD IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE UTILITY AND AND SO -- WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP WILL SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE MEMBERS. IN REGARDS TO THE TECH INNOVATION THAT -- YOU'RE LOOKING. TO TO TO PURSUE ADD WOULD PRESAGE A BANNER TODAY. THANK YOU WILL BE -- WILL BE HAPPY TO GET YOUR KHÃ´NG COME BACK YOUR PLEASURE FEED LIKE I'D STAY ANOTHER TWO HOURS TODAY. THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY. BUT I WILL SAY THIS THE NEXT TIME THAT WE HAVE -- YOUR REVIEW AND THE PUBLIC -- ADVOCATE'S OFFICE -- ON THE IN TIME WE MAY TAKE THEM FIRST THE NEXT AROUND JUST A SENSE OF FAIRNESS. BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU AGAIN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- ELIZABETH ECHOES DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WE APOLOGIZE -- FOR THE LET THE CONVERSATION BUT YOU CAN APPRECIATE. THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE. US AND TRYINGTO GET OUR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND IT BUT WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY APPRECIATE IT. I WANT TO QUICKLY INTRODUCE THE OTHERS WHO ARE HERE WITH ME AT THE TABLE -- LINDA SERWIS OW I IS MY DEPUTY FOR ENERGY. DARWIN FOR OUR CHIEF COUNSEL AND NOT SKINNER IS THE SUPERVISOR OVER OUR SAFETY SECTION. AND MY ATTORNEY WANT MY OTHER ATTORNEY NOT DARLING BY THE WANTED ME TO READ SOMETHING IF. THEY'RE ALL LEAVING OKAY JUST IN TERMS OF EX PARTE IF THERE WERE IF THIS STATEMENT BUT I DON'T HAVE TO NOW SO. OKAY SO AS YOU KNOW -- THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS THE INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE AT THE C.. AND OUR MISSION IS TO OBTAIN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES FOR SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH. SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE LEVELS. OUR GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE REGULATED INDUSTRY SECTORS ENERGY WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. SO EACH DOLLAR INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA'S UTILITIES ACHIEVES THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE RETURN FOR CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF SAFETY RELIABILITY AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. WE PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS AS WELL BY WORKING TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF CRITICAL UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WORK HARD TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INPUT ON UTILITY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE INDUSTRY AREAS TO REDUCE SAFETY RISKS AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS. I WANT TO SAY UP FRONT THAT MY HEART TRULY GOES OUT TO THE VICTIMS OF THE MOST RECENT WHILE ALL OF THE STATES -- FIRES BUT PARTICULARLY THE TRAGIC ONES IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- AND WE WANT TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTNER WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES AND TAKE REAL STEPS. TO PREVENT ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THIS FROM OCCURRING. SO I HOPEFULLY YOU ALL HAVE MY SLIDES AND MY REPORT AT THIS POINT -- SO I'M NOW ON THE SECOND SLIDE SECOND PAGE. WE PROVIDE A VOICE FOR MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS MANY OF WHOM DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THE STATE'S COMPLEX. PROCESS SEES OUR DEDICATED STAFF. ANALYZES UTILITY COSTS AND OPERATIONS AND REVIEWS SAFETY RELATED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. LAST YEAR OUR TEAM DISSIPATED AND HUNDREDS OF C. U. P. C. P. C. PROCEEDINGS FILED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PLEADINGS. AND WORKED SUCCESSFULLY TO ADVOCATE FOR CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CPC. THAT HARD WORK PAID OFF LAST YEAR WE SAVE CONSUMERS OVER THREE POINT THREE BILLION AND REDUCED RATES AVOIDED COSTS AND CUSTOMER REFUNDS. THAT IS A COMPARISON IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY UTILITIES REQUESTED IN TERMS OF A RATE INCREASE AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE BY PREFER PRESENTING ANALYSIS THAT SHOWED THAT THOSE REQUESTS WERE TOO HIGH. OKAY NOW I'M ON SLIDE FOUR I WANT TO JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON OUR POLICY ADVOCACY AS WELL BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT WE DO ON GENERAL RATE CASES AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS THAT IMPACT RATES. WE ALSO WORK TO ADVANCE THE STATE POLICIES INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY AND UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO UTILITY SERVICES. INSURING SAFE UTILITY OPERATIONS AND RELIABLE SERVICES AND ADVOCATING FOR THE COST EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. AND I'M JUST GONNA GIVE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF THOSE THINGS AND THE NEXT FEW SLIDES. SO FIRST OF ALL ON LIDE FIVE ON AFFORDABLE AND EQUITABLE SERVICES A KEY DRIVER FOR OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS IN ADVANCING STATE POLICIES TOWARDS HELPING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AND OTHER VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS. IS BY ADVOCATING FOR AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES. WERE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE CPC'S RULEMAKING THAT'S FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE AFFORDABILITY ACROSS ALL THE UTILITY INDUSTRY AREAS. ELECTRIC WATER GAS AND EVEN BEFORE THIS ROOM RULEMAKING. WE WERE RAISING CONCERNS REGARDING THE IMPACTS OF INDIVIDUAL PIECE MEAL REQUESTS MADE BY THE UTILITIES THAT WEREN'T TRANSPARENT AND PLACE PRESSURE ON RESIDENTIAL RATES AND CUSTOMER BILLS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS THAT RAISE RATES JUST A LITTLE BIT HERE AND A LITTLE BIT THERE THAT CUMULATIVE AFFECT ADDS UP PRETTY DARN QUICKLY. AND I AM INSTANTLY AS A VICE CHAIR WAS SAYING EARLIER THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ALREADY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEIR BILLS SO WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE ANY RATE INCREASES THAT THOSE ARE REALLY MADE AN A AND A THOUGHTFUL CAREFUL WAY AND IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THESE OTHER. RATE INCREASES. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR MISSION ALSO IS TO ADVOCATE FOR COST EFFECTIVE SERVICE THAT'S PROVIDED IN A SAFE AND RELIABLE MANNER. AND HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY OPERATE AND MANAGE THEIR FACILITIES IS PARAMOUNT TO ENSURING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. OVER THE LACKS DECADE PARTICULARLY SINCE THE TRAGIC VÃ  SAN BRUNO. EXPLOSION. THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE HAS BROADENED AND DEEPENED OUR SAFETY EXPERTISE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF ADVOCATING FOR STRONGER SAFETY REGULATIONS AND UTILITY COMPLIANCE TO THOSE REGULATIONS. JUST POINT TO A COUPLE OF QUICK EXAMPLES ON ON SLIDE SIX SO FOR EXAMPLE. WE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY AND AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BE REQUIRED TO PRESSURE TEST AND WHERE NECESSARY REPLACE PARTS OF ONE OF THEIR MAJOR NATURAL. GAS TRANSMISSION LINES THAT'S LINE. SIXTEEN HUNDRED WE PROVIDED EVIDENCE NEEDED TO BE PRESSURE TESTED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS AND THE COMMISSION AGREED WITH THAT. WE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR ENHANCED CONSUMER PROTECTION ACROSS ENERGY AND WATER SERVICES. IT IN CASE OF NATURAL DISASTER MAKING IT EASY FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE DISCOUNTED RATES AS WELL AS SUSPENDING VARIOUS FEES AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS WHEN PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED BY A BY A NATURAL DISASTER OR FIRE -- WHERE ALSO AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE CPC'S WILD FIRE RELATED PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING SB? NINE OH ONE WHERE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE CPC IS PROCEEDING REGARDING THE D. ENERGY IS ATION OF POWER LINES. IN THIS PROCEEDING THE PC IS EXAMINING RULES THAT ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO DE ENERGIZED POWER LINES IN CASE OF A DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IT IS HUGE CHALLENGES NOW FACING ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT. THE CONSUMER IS NOT ONLY NEED TO BE KEPT SAFE BUT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN BOTH WITH THEIR MONTHLY BILLS AND THEIR UTILITY SERVICES. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR TOP PRIORITIES INCLUDE KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON MAKING SURE THAT THE UTILITY SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND ALSO INSURING THAT CUSTOMERS DON'T. FOOT THE BILL FOR ANY UTILITY MISDEEDS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE A STRONG VOICE FOR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE TIME BUT THE MEANS TO PARTICIPATE IN STATE PROCESSES. ON SAFETY AND AFFORDABILITY MATTERS. FINALLY A SIDE SEVEN ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. WE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE REALLY WANT TO REDUCE THE GS GHG EMISSIONS AND HOPEFULLY. REDUCED THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACTS LIKE THE FIRES THAT WERE HAVING CALIFORNIA'S ONLY 1% OF GHG EMISSIONS SO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE MODELS THAT OTHER STATES OTHER COUNTRIES CAN FOLLOW THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE GOALS. SO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS OUR WORK ON ELECTRIFICATION HERE WE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED TO DEPLOY A TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZED THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRICAL VEHICLES WHILE MINIMIZING THE COST IMPACTS TO RATE PAYERS. IS SIX UTILITIES CAME FORWARD THIS INCLUDED P. JEANNIE S. C. S. T. JEANNIE LIBERTY BEAR VALLEY AND PACIFIC CORPS. AND REQUESTED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AND WE PRESSED FOR PRIORITIZING TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION INVESTMENTS AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SETTING RATES SAID ENCOURAGE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING AT TIMES IT IN HANDSOME GRAND ROYAL RELIABILITY. AND ESTABLISHING PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT MAXIMIZE LESSONS LEARNED AND PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND BASED ON THESE EFFORTS THAT P. YOU SEE ADOPTED A BUDGET THAT REDUCE THE UTILITY'S REQUEST BY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BUT STILL ACHIEVE THE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION GOALS. SO FINALLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT GOING FORWARD WE'RE WE CAN WILL CONTINUE. TO OUR GOAL WILL BE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ACROSS THE REGULATED SECTORS ENERGY WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND MEETING THE CHALLENGES AHEAD AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. BOTH THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE -- I WANTED TO JUST BECAUSE YOU TOUCH ON ALL OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT AREAS THAT -- WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT AS IT RELATES TO RATEPAYERS AND MAINTAINING STABILITY WITH THE RATES AND IN CASES OF HIGH WIND EVENTS IN AND THE WILDFIRES DE ENERGY IS A SIN A STRATEGIES. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND THE LIKE -- ARE YOU GOING TO PLAY A ROLE WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION AS IT RELATES TO OUR VALUE WAITING THE THE PLAN THAT PGA ANY AS THE REORGANIZATION PLAN WHAT WHAT ROLE WHERE YOU PLAY. AS THE ADVOCATES IN THAT CONVERSATION -- WITH P. JEANNIE WHILE THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY WHAT WILL WHAT WE CERTAINLY WILL PLAY A ROLE IN IN TERMS OF ADVOCATING FOR THE CONSUMERS IN THAT BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND I SAY PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THEY'LL BE BOTH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN AND WHAT THE CPC IS DOING AS WELL -- IT IS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THERE'S SOMEONE THERE WHO IS PURELY REPRESENTING THAT CONSUMERS OF THE STATE -- LAST TIME AROUND AS YOU MAY RECALL THAT CUSTOMERS ENDED UP FOOTING THE BILL IN ITS ENTIRETY -- WITH SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO EVERYBODY WAS MADE WHOLE EXCEPT FOR THE CONSUMERS SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE THERE AT THE TABLE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMER INTERESTS ARE ARE REPRESENTED. SO YOU HAVE A A DEFINED ROLE THAT YOU WILL BE PLAIN WE KNOW WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT. THAT THERE IS A ROLE THAT THE CPC WILL HAITIAN PLAN. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU ARE BUILT INTO THAT IN TERMS OF HAVING A VOICE THAT WILL HELP GIVE SOME DIRECTION IN SHAPING THE PLAN AS IT RELATES TO PROTECTING REPAIRS. RIGHT SO IS SO NOTHING IS IS REALLY EVER BAKED IN OUR ARE BUILT IN WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT SO IF WE WANT TO BE A PARTY AT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WE WOULD HAVE TO APPLY FOR THAT -- WE THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY QUALIFY FOR THAT IF THAT'S THE ROUTE THAT WE DECIDE TO GO -- WE'RE EVALUATING DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR MAKING MAKING OUR VOICE HEARD -- BUT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY WE WE COULD QUALIFY -- AS AS THE VOICE FOR CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND JUST MY LAST QUESTION DO YOU -- DO YOU GO OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND HOLD -- INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS WITH A RAPIER GROUPS AROUND THE STATE OR DO THEY HAVE TO ARE YOU SORT OF CENTERED AND SACRAMENTO OR SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES AND THEN THEY HAVE TO FIND THEIR WAY TO YOU. RIGHT SO WE WE WORK -- WE DO WORK WITH OTHER CONSUMER ADVOCATES ARE ON THE STATE -- WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR OWN FORMS BUT WE CERTAINLY GET TO KNOW THOSE FOLKS -- THROUGH THE VARIOUS -- PUBLIC FIRST PARTICIPATION ALSO PARTICIPATE IN AND SO LOCALIZED IRATE PAIRED GROUPS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THOSE A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS KNOW US AS WELL AND REACH OUT TO US AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S OTHER. STATE WHY GROUPS LIKE TURN ON THAT WE THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH [inaudible] APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY -- I'M GOING TO TURN TO THE FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH MY PLEASURE OR YOUR REPORT. AND I PROMISE YOU WILL BE FIRST -- THE NEXT TIME YOU EAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THIS WAS ACTUALLY VERY I IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION SO I DIDN'T MIND AT ALL -- I'LL TURN TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE REMAINING THAT -- WANTED TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE -- PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THIS AGENDA. SEEING NONE -- ANY CLOSING COMMENTS ANY. THIS MEANS ADJOURNED
