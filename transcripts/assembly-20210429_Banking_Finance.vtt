THAT WE PUT IN PROCESS IN THE

02:17:14.426 --> 02:17:16.828

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:18.063
GOD LET GUIDELINES ON CREATING

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:19.998

UNDERSTANDING IS THIS MONEY

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.467
WOULD PROBABLY THE DEPOSITORY

AMENDMENT HAT ACTUALLY

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:41.252

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:48.059
FINANCIAL INDUSTRY DURING THE

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.762
CRASH NO THAT. THING SOMETIMES

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:51.696
DON'T WORK EVEN WHEN WE THINK

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:53.531
THEY WILL BE ON. THE STATE WILL

02:17:53.598 --> 02:17:54.466
HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

02:17:54.532 --> 02:17:55.967
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AND

02:17:56.034 --> 02:17:57.602
THAT THAT HAS BEEN ANALYZED IN

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:58.870

02:18:06.878 --> 02:18:08.747
LEGISLATURE BUT WE'LL COME BACK

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:11.349
TO BOTH. OF THAT BOTH THE

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:12.917

COMMITTEES FOR A FULL REVIEW

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:16.521
AND APPROVAL I THINK THAT'S

02:18:16.588 --> 02:18:17.756
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I THINK

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:18.857
IT'S- AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT'S

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.859
IMPORTANT THAT IT'S NOT. YET

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:21.993
SLID INTO A TROUBLE BUT

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.295
PROPERLY ANALYZED BY THOSE WHO

02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:28.199
ARE EXPERTS IN ANALYZING. THE

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:29.768
SORT OF THINGS. I SAY IT ONE

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.169
LAST AND THAT IS TO THE BOARD I.

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:32.137
HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:34.139
BOARD MEMBERS INSTILL. INTO

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:37.142
CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT. AND

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:38.877
UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:41.279
DEPOSITORY IS NOT ACTUALLY A

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:42.414
TRADITIONAL BANK AND THIS BOARD

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.982
WOULD ACTUALLY BE RUNNING A

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:46.317
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. IT IS

02:18:46.384 --> 02:18:48.319
CONCERNING TO ME. THAT THERE IS

02:18:48.386 --> 02:18:51.122
NOT. A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:53.425
FINANCIAL EXPERTS ON THAT BOARD

02:18:53.491 --> 02:19:04.102
ESPECIALLY. SINCE THE STATE

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.237
REALLY. AT SOME LEVEL BE.

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:07.906
BEYOND THE FTA. AND SO I KNOW

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:08.673
YOU DO WANT THE WHOLE BOARD TO

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.441
BE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:10.475
FINANCED EXPERTS I DON'T EITHER

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:11.276
I THINK THAT THERE. GREAT BY.

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:13.578
IN A TO. OF FIRST. ON BOARD-

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:15.313
AND IT IS THE- POINT BUT I

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.615
WANNA. COMMIT THAT THAT I AM

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:18.516
VERY CONCERNED. IT AND THAT

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:21.352
THAT IT SHOULD NEED A FRESH. ON

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.188
THIS IS A HUGE. BILLION

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:25.256

UNDERSTAND AND CAN REALLY GUIDE

02:19:35.233 --> 02:19:36.968
THIS PROCESS I THINK IS VERY

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:39.704
VERY IMPORTANT AND SO. I DON'T.

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:40.638

THAT THAT IS IT WOULD BE

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:47.545
IRRESPONSIBLE ON SOME LEVEL FOR

WHAT THE STUDY RECOMMENDS AND

02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:14.806

BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.675
LEGISLATURE AS WELL. IS TO

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.510
MAKING THE STATUE CHANGES THAT

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:21.345
MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE BECAUSE

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:24.415
OF THE STUDY- IF IT THE STUDY

02:25:24.482 --> 02:25:25.183
FOUND THAT IT WAS GOING TO

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:28.419
WORK. IF THESE THINGS CHANGED.

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:30.288
THEN THE LEGISLATURE THEN HAS

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.457
THE ABILITY. AT THAT POINT TO

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:34.392
ACT UPON THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:36.794
OF THE STUDY. OR THE OR THE

02:25:36.861 --> 02:25:40.031
LEGISLATURE. AND COMMITTEES

02:25:40.098 --> 02:25:40.965

CHALLENGES ADD TO THAT THAT

02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:46.337
THAT. IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE US

02:25:46.404 --> 02:25:48.573
IF THERE IF THERE IS THAT- IF

02:25:48.639 --> 02:25:49.607
THERE IS A BUNCH OF OPERATIONS

02:25:49.674 --> 02:25:51.175

PUBLIC BANK THIS IS NOT THAT.

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:04.055
UNDERSTOOD I THINK. THERE'S

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.556
CONFUSION BECAUSE IT'S CALLED.

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.658

OR- OR SAY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:29.080

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:34.285
COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME. AND THE

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:34.986
LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME TO

02:26:35.052 --> 02:26:38.322
DECIDE. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO

02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.923
WITH IT IT JUST COMES BACK TO

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:41.826

THE AUTHOR- FOR THE GOAL I MEAN

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:01.646
I'VE HAD CALLS WITH THE

02:27:01.712 --> 02:27:02.847
OPPOSITION WHERE THEY SAID WELL

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:04.715

THAT'S ON BANK INTO ME THAT'S

02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:07.952
TOO MUCH RIGHT AND SO I THINK

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:08.853
EVEN THOUGH WHETHER THAT

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:09.987
ESTIMATE IS RIGHT OR WRONG

02:27:10.054 --> 02:27:10.955
WHOSE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT

CALIFORNIA IS UNBANKED OR

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:14.992
UNDERBANKED IS TOO MUCH. AND

02:27:15.059 --> 02:27:16.093
YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:16.994
THAT HERE AND I THINK THAT'S

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:19.096
IMPORTANT AND IT'S A GOAL THAT

02:27:19.163 --> 02:27:20.631

THE STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC

02:27:33.878 --> 02:27:35.479
DOLLARS. AND NOT THIS BOARD

02:27:35.546 --> 02:27:36.914
THAT IS BEING SET UP AND SO IT

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.549
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE AS THOSE

02:27:38.616 --> 02:27:40.184
STORIES OF THE PEOPLE ACTED BY

02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:40.952
THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN

02:27:41.018 --> 02:27:42.386
CALIFORNIA MAKE THE ULTIMATE

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:45.156
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THIS-IS APPROPRIATE OR NOT SO THANK

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:47.191

02:27:47.258 --> 02:27:49.227
WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES SO

YOU KNOW A FEW OF US HERE HAVE

02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:53.164
ABOUT EIGHT MORE YEARS NINE

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:54.265
MORE YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATURE

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.566
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE MANY OF

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:56.500
US WILL BE HERE WHEN THIS COMES

02:27:56.567 --> 02:27:59.170
BACK AND THE BOARD COMPOSITION

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.338
IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

02:28:00.404 --> 02:28:01.172
IMPORTANT TO ME AND CURRENTLY

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:04.308
AS I READ IT ONLY ONE MAYBE TWO

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.576
OF THESE FOLKS ARE BANKING

02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:09.747
EXPERTS ONE HAS A BANKING

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:10.514
EXPERTISE THE OTHER IS A- IT

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:12.683
SAID A- THEY- WORK FOR.

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:14.885
ADVOCATE FOR THE BANKS- SO

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:16.487
MAYBE THAT PERSON WOULD ALSO A

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.456
BAKING EXPERTISE AND NINE. AND

02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:19.357
WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO THE

02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:20.758
LEGISLATURE I THINK IT IS

02:28:20.825 --> 02:28:22.059
CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:24.061
HAS FAITH IN THIS FEASIBILITY

02:28:24.128 --> 02:28:25.730
STUDY. AND SO THE COMPOSITION

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:26.764
OF THE BOARD NOT ONLY IS

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:28.299
IMPORTANT TO US HERE TODAY BUT

02:28:28.366 --> 02:28:29.433
I BELIEVE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.735
FOR LEGISLATORS TO VOTE ON THIS

02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:31.969
IN THE FUTURE. AND SO THE

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:33.170
INTEGRITY OF THE STUDY IS

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:34.538
CRITICAL I THINK TO A GOAL

02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:36.407
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND I

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.775
THINK THAT CHANGING THE

02:28:37.842 --> 02:28:39.377
COMPOSITION I SUGGESTED BY MANY

02:28:39.443 --> 02:28:41.045
MEMBERS HERE. WILL HELP THIS

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.480
GOAL. WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:44.048
FEASIBILITY STUDY IS TRUSTED BY

02:28:44.115 --> 02:28:45.549
THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE. AND

02:28:45.616 --> 02:28:47.084
HOPEFULLY IF IT'S SURE TO BE

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:50.588
FEASIBLE. WILL BE ACTED UPON- I

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:51.689
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.190
IS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:54.425
CONFUSION ABOUT THE DEPOSITORY

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:55.493
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE

02:28:55.559 --> 02:28:57.261
DEPOSITARY HAD TO BE FDIC

02:28:57.328 --> 02:28:58.729
INSURED. THANK YOU RIGHT THE

02:28:58.796 --> 02:29:00.064
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I KNOW

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:01.932
THAT IT THAT IT AYE I USE THE

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.100
WORD PARTNER BUT OBVIOUSLY BRAG

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:04.669
HERE. WOULD HAVE TO WOULD HAVE

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:06.270
TO BE FDIC INSURED AND ALL THIS

02:29:06.337 --> 02:29:08.639
AND ALL THE- ALL THE SAFEGUARDS

02:29:08.706 --> 02:29:11.542
TO ANY. BANK COMMUNITY BANK OR

02:29:11.609 --> 02:29:13.077
CREDIT UNION. WOULD HAVE TO

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.979
TAKE ON WE WOULD EXPECT.

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:17.014
WHOEVER PARTNERS UP WOULD HAVE

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:19.250
THOSE SAME SORT OF- BUT-

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:21.252
PROTECTIONS AND ABIDE BY RULES.

02:29:21.319 --> 02:29:22.687
SO I KNOW THAT THE BILL SAYS

02:29:22.753 --> 02:29:23.788
THAT THE INSTITUTION AFTER

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:25.556
FIVE. HAS TO COMPLY WITH ALL

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:26.757
FEDERAL STATE LAWS AND TO ME IT

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:28.492
WAS ACTUALLY NOT CLEAR. WHETHER

02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:30.261
THAT MEANT THAT THE INSTITUTION

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:31.729
HAD BE FDIC INSURED AND SO I

02:29:31.796 --> 02:29:32.396
THINK THERE'S ROOM IN THE

02:29:32.463 --> 02:29:33.998
LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU'RE

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:34.799
SAYING AND I WOULD APPRECIATE

02:29:34.865 --> 02:29:37.234
THAT- I ALSO ASSUME THAT ONE OF

02:29:37.301 --> 02:29:38.369
THE OPTIONS FOR THAT

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:40.671
INSTITUTION IS A PUBLIC BANK-

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.406
I. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT IS

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:43.341
THAT THAT PUBLIC BANK WOULD

02:29:43.407 --> 02:29:44.275
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

02:29:44.342 --> 02:29:46.344
WE SET UP IN AB FIFTY SEVEN IN

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:52.650
ORDER TO BE AN OPTION. FOR THE

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:53.084
PARTNER IS THAT YOUR

02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.751
UNDERSTANDING. HELLO HAVE TO BE

02:29:53.818 --> 02:29:54.318
SET UP IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:55.686
BUT- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:56.253
BRINGING UP THE STATE. AND

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.322
FEDERAL WE JUST. THE SOONER WE

02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:59.623
SAID FEDERAL IT WOULD CAPTURE

02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:00.925
ALL THE DIFFERENT LAWS THAT ARE

02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:02.293
UNDER FEDERAL INCLUDING FBI

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:04.762
INSERTED FTI SEE INSURED. AND

02:30:04.829 --> 02:30:06.997
WHEN WE MET STATE- I KNOW IT'S

02:30:07.064 --> 02:30:08.466
THE D. DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:10.134
OVERSIGHT STRANGE TO NAME BUT

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:12.370
ALL THAT INCLUDES- THROUGHOUT

02:30:12.436 --> 02:30:14.438
THAT PROCESS AS WELL. MANY LAWS

02:30:14.505 --> 02:30:16.040
THAT MAY BE IN THE BOOKS OKAY

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:17.475
THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT

02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:19.243
AND SO LASTLY I WANT TO TOUCH

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:20.444
ON THE FEASIBILITY STUDY AND

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:23.214
WHAT IT LOOKS THAT- CURRENTLY

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:26.317
WITH MISS. BURKE'S AMENDMENT

02:30:26.384 --> 02:30:27.752
AND OFFENSIVE CALL YOUR MEMBER

02:30:27.818 --> 02:30:29.220
OR NOT BUT- IT WAS. THREE

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:31.288
THINGS. RATE WHETHER CAN BE

02:30:31.355 --> 02:30:32.790
IMPLEMENTED WHETHER IT CAN PAY

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.191
FOR ITSELF WITHIN SIX YEARS AND

02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:35.025
THEN WHETHER THERE'S RISK IN A

02:30:35.092 --> 02:30:36.927
DOWNTURN. I THINK THAT ACTUALLY

02:30:36.994 --> 02:30:37.928
MISSED BETWEEN OUR SORT OF

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:38.996
TOUCHED ON THE THING THAT I WAS

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:40.564
FOCUSED ON THAT'S MISSING FROM

02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:42.066
THE FEASIBILITY STUDY. WHICH IS

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:44.301
EXACTLY WHAT AND THE CONTROLLER

02:30:44.368 --> 02:30:45.770
TALKED ABOUT WHICH- IS THERE A

02:30:45.836 --> 02:30:47.638
LESS RISKY AND LESS COSTLY

02:30:47.705 --> 02:30:48.739
ALTERNATIVE IS THIS THE RIGHT

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:50.441
SOLUTION. RIGHT I MEAN EVEN

02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:52.076
THOUGH I'M ON BOARD WITH WHAT.

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.844
WITH THE GOAL OF THIS BILL I

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.045
THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:56.647
WERE DOING THIS STUDY. WE

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:57.548
SHOULD BE DOING THE STUDY TO

02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.049
MEANINGFUL WAY TO DECIDE WHAT

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.284
THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE OUR

02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:01.952
GOAL IS. RATHER THAN DICTATING

02:31:02.019 --> 02:31:03.754
WHAT WE THINK THE ANSWER IS I

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:04.555
THINK WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO

02:31:04.622 --> 02:31:06.123
OTHER ANSWERS. AND SO I WOULD

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.925
REALLY URGE THAT THE FINAL

02:31:07.992 --> 02:31:09.693
AMENDMENT TO THIS B. WE ASK

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.662
THAT WE ADDED AN ANALYSIS OF.

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:16.233
OTHER ALTERNATIVES THEY. MAY BE

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:20.104
LESS RISKY AND LESS COSTLY. BUT

02:31:20.171 --> 02:31:21.372
WE THOUGHT WE COVERED THAT WORK

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:23.340
SAYS. AND I DON'T WANT. TO

02:31:23.407 --> 02:31:24.508
NEGOTIATE ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF

02:31:24.575 --> 02:31:26.343
WHAT THE CHAIRS ALREADY ASKED

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:28.512
US TO TAKE BECAUSE- THIS IS

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:29.914
WHAT THIS IS WHAT WAS ASKED

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:32.917
BUT- WHEN. WHEN I SAW THAT PAUL

02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:34.051
DOES ABOUT- MY GLASSES GIVE

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:36.053
FONG. THE PRESENCE OF A REAL

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.254
WHETHER THE PRESENCE OF PRIVATE

02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:39.290
SECTOR OR NON. NONPROFIT

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:41.459
COMPETITORS TO THE PROGRAM IF

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:43.594
THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED THE

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:44.395
LEGISLATURE COULD DETERMINE TO

02:31:44.462 --> 02:31:46.363
MOVE FORWARD OR NOT. SO WE

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:47.097
INCLUDED IT BECAUSE IT WILL

02:31:47.164 --> 02:31:48.332
HAVE TO ANSWER WHETHER THERE

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:50.367
ARE PRIVATE COMPETITORS. OR

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:51.869
NONPROFIT COMPETITORS TO THE

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:54.772
PROGRAM UP SO IF. THEY'LL HAVE

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:56.674
TO STATE THOSE RATE SO YOU HAVE

02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.075
IT IN THE MARKET ANALYSIS

02:31:58.142 --> 02:31:58.976
YOU'RE READING FROM THE SECTION

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.344
OF WHAT THE MARKET ANALYSIS

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:01.579
SHOULD INCLUDE WHICH DOES

02:32:01.645 --> 02:32:03.314
INCLUDE THAT OF WHAT THE ALT

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:06.584
pMARKET. AND THEY'RE BEING OTHER

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:07.518
THINGS ON THE MARKET COULD

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:09.086
STILL MAKE THIS FEASIBLE BY THE

02:32:09.153 --> 02:32:09.987
DEFINITION OF THAT IT'S

02:32:10.054 --> 02:32:11.355
IMPLEMENTABLE THAT IS NOT

02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:12.957
RISKING A DOWNTURN AND THAT IT

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:14.124
CAN PAY FOR ITSELF IN SIX

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:16.093
YEARS. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.228
WE CAN DO IT IN A MORE FISCALLY

02:32:17.294 --> 02:32:19.730
CONSERVATIVE. AND RISK LAST

02:32:19.797 --> 02:32:21.899
RISKY WAY AND I THINK THAT THAT

02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:22.766
IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT

02:32:22.833 --> 02:32:23.501
WE SHOULD BE ASKING YOU THE

02:32:23.567 --> 02:32:24.602
FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH WOULD

02:32:24.668 --> 02:32:26.036
BE NOT IN THE MARKET ANALYSIS

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:27.371
SECTION BUT IN THAT SECTION.

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:28.205
THEY CURRENTLY ONLY HAS TWO

02:32:28.272 --> 02:32:30.241
PARTS BUT WILL NOW HAVE A THIRD

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:31.375
PART AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.643
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION WE

02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:33.544
SHOULDN'T PREDETERMINE THE

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:34.578
ANSWER TO HOW TO SOLVE THIS

02:32:34.645 --> 02:32:36.213
PROBLEM. SO I URGE YOU TO

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:39.583

THEM. I LIKE THE IDEA OF

02:33:07.945 --> 02:33:09.213
COMPETITION I THINK THIS IS A

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.815
VERY INTRIGUING IDEA AND ONE.

SAVINGS OF LOW INCOME

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:24.628

LET'S NOT POINTED IN ONE

02:34:00.898 --> 02:34:01.632
DIRECTION OR THE OTHER LET'S

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:03.300
LET'S CALL THE QUESTION. GET

02:34:03.367 --> 02:34:05.035
EXPERTS TO WEIGH IN. AND TRY TO

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:05.869
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY IS

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:07.371
TO DELIVER THE SERVICES BECAUSE

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:08.706
THESE THESE COMMUNITIES DESERVE

02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:10.741
THOSE SERVICES. I DO I DO SHARE

02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:13.143
THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT- AFTER

IN SPECIFICALLY TO THE LANGUAGE

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:18.616
WOULD BE. WOULD BE HELPFUL- I

02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:19.650
DID ALSO WANT TO RAISE THE

02:34:19.717 --> 02:34:21.285

02:43:29.099 --> 02:43:30.000
THE COMMITTEE HAS A LOT OF

02:43:30.066 --> 02:43:32.269
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. ABOUT

02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:33.069
WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE

02:43:33.136 --> 02:43:35.539
TODAY. I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN

02:43:35.605 --> 02:43:37.007
MY OWN STATEMENTS AND

02:43:37.073 --> 02:43:38.241
CONVERSATIONS THAT I AM DEEPLY

02:43:38.308 --> 02:43:39.876
CONCERNED. ABOUT HAVING THE

02:43:39.943 --> 02:43:42.045
STATE OPERATE- HAVING THE STATE

02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.914

FINANCIAL SERVICES PLATFORM.

02:43:45.882 --> 02:43:47.184
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

GOVERNMENT DOES REALLY WELL.

02:43:49.419 --> 02:43:50.320

BUILD OFF EXISTING SUCCESSFUL

02:43:57.761 --> 02:43:59.863
MODELS. I WORRY THIS BILL

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:01.431
REQUIRES THE STATE TO TAKE ON A

02:44:01.498 --> 02:44:03.533
TASK. IT CANNOT POSSIBLY

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:05.368
DELIVER ON. ONLY TO REPLICATE

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:06.970
THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE BY

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:08.605
COMMUNITY BANKS. CREDIT UNIONS

02:44:08.672 --> 02:44:11.141
