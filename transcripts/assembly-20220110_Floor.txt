ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TWENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL RELATIVE TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE JANUARY SIXTH ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. MR GABRIEL YOU MAY OPEN RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AJ ARE TWENTY TWO WHICH CONDEMNS THE VIOLENT INSURRECTION THAT OCCURRED AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL ON JANUARY SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I MUST CONFESS MISTER SPEAKER THAT EVEN WITH THE DISTANCE OF TIME AND GEOGRAPHY. IT STILL FEELS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO FULLY CONTEXTUALIZE THIS UGLY AND UNPRECEDENTED TAX ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. FOR MANY OF US JANUARY SIX CONJURES UP GROTESQUE IMAGES SEARED INTO OUR NATIONAL MEMORY. A VIOLENT MOBS STORMING THE CAPITAL. CONSPIRACY THEORISTS AND BODY PAIN AND FIRST SWINGING FROM THE WALLS OF THE SENATE CHAMBER. INSURRECTIONIST WITH CONFEDERATE FLAGS IN CAMP AUSCHWITZ T. SHIRTS HUNTING FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR PERSONAL OFFICES. EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE PAUSE AND HER REFLECT ON THAT HORRIFIC DAY. FIRST AND FOREMOST TO RECOGNIZE THE BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO WERE INJURED AND KILLED PROTECTING UNITED STATES CAPITOL. THE INSURRECTION RESULTED IN PHYSICAL HARM TO OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND MULTIPLE DEATHS. INCLUDING UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER BRIAN SICKENING WHO IS BEING BY RIDERS AND DIED OF A STROKE THE FOLLOWING DAY. AS WELL AS OFFICERS HOWARD LEAVING GOOD. GUNTHER HAS SHE TO. PILE THE FREITAG AND GEOFFREY SMITH WHO STOOD GUARD THAT DAY AND WHO TRAGICALLY TOOK THEIR OWN LIVES IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WERECALL JANUARY SIX TO PRESERVE THE HISTORICAL RECORD. TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SHOCKINGLY SOME ARE ALREADY TRYING TO REWRITE HISTORY TO WHITEWASH AND EXCUSE THOSE WHO ATTEMPTED TO SUBVERT OUR DEMOCRACY. SO LET US STATE CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY. THE JANUARY SIX RIDERS WEREN'T SOME INNOCENT GROUP OF TOURISTS SEEKING TO PEACEFULLY EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THEY WERE A GROUP OF VIOLENT TRUMP SUPPORTERS SEEKING TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WERE INCITED TO VIOLENCE BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND THEY SOUGHT TO DISRUPT THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. THAT HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR REPUBLIC. PUT SIMPLY JANUARY SEX WAS AN ATTEMPTED CO. THAT'S WHY THE WORK OF THE BIPARTISAN SELECT COMMITTEE IS SO IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE A FULL ACCOUNTING ABOUT THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DAY AND TO ENSURE MAXIMUM ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ATTACKED OUR GOVERNMENT. H. A R. TWENTY TWO IS ALSO A REMINDER OF THE FRAGILITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND THE TREMENDOUS AND WORK IN FRONT OF US IF WE WANT OUR KIDS TO LIVE IN A TRULY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. EACH OF US IRRESPECTIVE OF PARTY HAS AN OBLIGATION NOT ONLY TO SPEAK OUT. BUT TO WORK TO ADVANCE VOTING RIGHTS AND TO AFFIRMATIVELY STRENGTH IN OUR DEMOCRACY. FOR MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE WORDS OF KARL ROVE. VENERATED BY YOUR PARTY AND FRANKLY DESPISED BY MANY IN MINE. WHO WROTE LAST WEEK ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE INSURRECTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A DUTY TO CONDEMN THE RIOT AND THOSE WHO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE COULD BE NO SOFT PEDDLING WHAT HAPPENED AND NO ABSOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO PLANT ENCOURAGED AND AIDED THE ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW OUR DEMOCRACY. LOVE OF COUNTRY DEMANDS NOTHING LESS. I HOPE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WILL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING H. A R. TWENTY TWO. IN HONORING THOSE WHO WERE INJURED AND KILLED DEFENDING THE CAPITAL. IN SUPPORTING THE WORK OF THE BIPARTISAN SELECT COMMITTEE. AND CONDEMNING ALL FORMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND ATTACKS ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THE OATH THAT WE ALL SWORE TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEMANDS NOTHING LESS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF G. R. TWENTY TWO. THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED JUST ONE YEAR AGO AT OUR CALIFORNIA AND OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. IF THEY WE ALL WATCH IN FEAR FOR THE LIVES OF OUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES THE STAFF THAT WORK THERE IN THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE. THERE TO DEFEND SIXTH WORK SIX FOUR THREATS FOR THE MARKET SEE. AND NOT JUST ANOTHER NORMAL TOURISTS VISIT. AS SOME HAVE DESCRIBED IT. THE REALITY S THAT OUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK WHILE BEFORE JANUARY SIXTH BUT THIS IS MADE THAT THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY ARE PRIMED TO THE WORLD AND MAGNIFIED OR NEED TO FIGHT FOR THE MARKERS THE WITH ARDOR. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A MARKER C. HAS AND ALWAYS WORK FOR EVERYONE AND IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES HAVE ORGANIZED FOR DECADES. TO ENSURE WE LIVE UP TO THE WORDS IN OUR FLAG SALUTE. OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE WORDS THAT WE JUST AT THE BEGINNING A TWO DAY SESSION. HOWEVER THE SYSTEMIC FORCES IN THE SAME FORCES BEHIND THE JANUARY SIX INSURRECTION ALWAYS FOUGHT HARD TO PREVENT THOSE WORDS FROM BEING TRULY IMPLEMENTED. LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE GENEROUSLY CONSTRUCTION IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS DECADES OLD FIGHT. IMAGES OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL STORMING THE CAPITOL AND ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY IT MAKING SURE THAT WE MUST CONTINUE THIS FIGHT. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN AMERICA THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE ALLOWS EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS EQUALLY SPECIALLY AT THE BALLOT BOX WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO ENSURE WE STRENGTHEN OUR VOTING RIGHTS ACTS ACROSS THE NATION. I'M PROUD THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN LEADING THE WAY. IN ENSURING THAT REMOVED ALL BARRIERS TO VOTING. BUT THIS THING IS NOT SURE ACROSS THE NATION. THE WORLD IS WATCHING. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO STAND DOWN AND WE DO STAND DOWN THAT ONLY FORTY FURTHER THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNITY IS ON THE FRONT LINE AND THAT'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. IT IS LIKE MINE WELL THE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THEIR AMERICAN DREAM IN SPITE OF A SYSTEM THAT HAS. A THAT IS STACKED AGAINST THEM. BECAUSE THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND FULLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE A DEMOCRACY WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER STOPPED WORKING DURING THIS TIME THAT MAKE SIGN OUR MASS CLEANING OUR HOSPITALS. BAGAN ARE GROCERIES BUT ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY ENDING UP IN THE HOSPITAL WITH COVE AND DYING. IT'S CONGRESS INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY THE GENERATORS ATTACK. TO HELP PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM THE SUMMER TECH IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT WE PASS STRONG VOTING LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- I FELT. AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FOR MAKING THIS BOARD. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA. MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIXTH WAS A DARK DAY IN AMERICAN HISTORY WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO BREACH THE CAPITAL MUST BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ACTIONS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW NO ONE SUPPORTS RIOTERS. IN PROSECUTING THE RIOTERS WE MUST SEND AN UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE. THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED THAT THEY MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WHO RESPONDED THAT DAY AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO RESTORE ORDER AND PROTECT THE CAPITAL AND ITS OCCUPANTS WE SAY THANK YOU. WHILE THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIXTH WERE HORRIFIC. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN IMMEASURABLY WORSE WITHOUT THE BRAVE ACTIONS OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN SURROUNDING THAT DAY ONE THING IS CERTAIN AMERICA WAS AND STILL IS A NATION DIVIDED. WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS NOW IS UNITY. AND I FRANKLY FEEL WE NEED A LOT MORE LOVE. KINDNESS AND RESPECT PARTISANSHIP OF FINGER POINTING IT'S ATIME FOR SOLEMN REFLECTION ON THE EVENTS OF THE DAY THE HEROISM OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO ENSURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND UNIFY OUR COUNTRY ONCE AND FOR ALL. SO I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. MR BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN- THE ACTIONS OF TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS. THAT LED TO JANUARY SIX ONE IS THE ACTIONS OF THE WRITERS WHICH WERE CRIMINAL- AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO. PHYSICALLY TAKE OVER OUR CAPITAL. WHERE THEY ASSAULTED LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS ALL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON BATONS. WITH FIRE IF WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. AND EVEN WITH THE AMERICAN FLAG THAT WE ALL PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO NOT TEN MINUTES AGO. THEY BROKE INTO THE CAPITAL. THEY DEFECATED. IN THE CAPITAL THEY URINATED IN THE CAPITAL- AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE LIKE LIKE THE MINORITY LEADER SAID EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. COMMITTED CRIMINAL ACTS AND SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ACTS OF A COMMITTED. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE ACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPREAD IT THE LIES THAT LED TO THE RIGHT ON JANUARY SIXTH. AND IT'S NOT ONLY PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO'S BEEN SPREADING LIES ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT IT'S BEEN OTHER OF POLITICAL OPERATIVES IT MAY BE USED THEIR AND THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO TRY TO CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT THE ELECTION IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE THAT THE ELECTION WASN'T ACCURATE THAT THE ELECTION WASN'T SAFE. AND THESE ARE LIES AND THESE ARE LIES THAT LEAD TO ACTIONS THAT WE SAW ON JANUARY SIXTH BUT IT'S ALSO THE PEOPLE THAT STAY QUIET. IN THE FACE OF THOSE LINES. IT'S A PEOPLE WHO WON'T STEP UP AND ADMIT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS THE DO WITH DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CONTINUE TO PROPOSE. LIES ABOUT OUR ELECTIONS AND THE ACCURACY OF OUR ELECTIONS- THAT OCCURRED LAST NOVEMBER I TWO NOVEMBERS AGO EXCUSE ME. IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO STAY QUIET IN THE FACE OF THESE LINES. THAT ARE JUST AS COMPLICIT AS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LINING IT'S THOSE PEOPLE WHO REFUSED TO STAND UP. MAYBE THE LEADERS IN THEIR OWN PARTY. TO SAY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS UNPATRIOTIC WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS UNAMERICAN AND YOUR VOTING THE FABRIC OF OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT A CLIFF EDGE RIGHT NOW. ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T THINK SO IS KIDDING THEMSELVES. YOUR ATTEMPTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR POLITICIANS TOOK OVER TED TO UNDO THE WILL OF THE ELECTORATE TO PUT THEIR CHOSEN POLITICIAN IN POWER. YOU ATTEMPTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY USING THIS THESE LINES. AND USING THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THOSE LIES AND CREATED TO TRY TO UNDERMINE OUR VOTING RIGHTS IN AMERICA. AND WE ALL MUST SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS DEMOCRAT DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN NO PARTY PREFERENCE INDEPENDENT WE ALL MUST SPEAK OUT TO TRY TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY. BECAUSE I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS A GREATER THREAT NOW THAN IT'S BEEN IN MY LIFE. AND I THINK IN MOST OF THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS. IN THIS ROOM. SO I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY AS THEY NEED TO THIS IS A PARTISAN. THIS IS AMERICAN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. AND I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE STRONGER THAN ONE PERSON'S CRAVE IN. ATTEMPTS TO GAIN POWER. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE OUR DEMOCRACY IS TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. SO I HOPE EVERYBODY REALLY THINK STRONGLY ABOUT THE WORDS OF THIS RESOLUTION. I HOPE EVERYONE REALLY THINKS ARE STRONGLY ABOUT THE ACTIONS NOT ONLY ON JANUARY SIXTH BUT THAT LED TO JANUARY SIXTH. AND THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE CONTINUED SINCE JANUARY SIXTH. TO TRY TO UNDERMINE AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY THAT WE ALL HOLD HOLD SO DEAR- I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF A J. R. TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR BERMAN. MISTER BENNETT. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. AND A DIRECT THREAT ON THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER NEEDS TO BE. CHALLENGED AND PEOPLE NEED TO STAND UP IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY YOU HAVE BOTH THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE PRIVILEGE TO FIGHT FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BENNET. THANK YOU MEMBERS SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MR GABRIEL YOU MAY CLOSE ON THE RESOLUTION. MR THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM. LO ANGELES COUNTY AND MENLO PARK INVENTOR FOR THEIR VALLEY ELOQUENT WORDS IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION. A FEW WEEKS AGO- I WAS BACK IN MARCH AND YOU SEE WITH THE NUMBER MEMBERS OF THIS BODY- WE WERE FORTUNATE TO BE BACK THERE FOR THE SIGNING OF A BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. WE HAD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT I'D STATES WITH. MEMBERS OF OUR CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. AND WHAT STRUCK ME SO POWERFULLY ABOUT ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS AS YOU KNOW WE BEGAN WITH WITH CHIT CHAT ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE NEED TO BRING DOLLARS BACK TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S TRANSITION FROM CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLICY. TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND HOW WORRIED AND CONCERNED AND FRIGHTENED. PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON DC ARE ABOUT THE VERY CONTINUED FUNCTIONING OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND I WOULD SAY I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT THE REPUBLICAN LEADER SAID TODAY ABOUT THE NEED TO LOOK FOR ABOUT THE NEED TO COME TOGETHER ABOUT THE NEED TO HEAL. I AGREE VERY STRONGLY WITH THAT BUT I'M STRUGGLING TO SQUARE THAT. WITH VOTING NO ON THIS RESOLUTION AND I WILL TELL YOU SPEAKING FOR MYSELF WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT I THINK CONCERNS MANY MEMBERS. OF MY PARTY AND MANY MEMBERS OF THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH ABOUT THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX BEYOND IT THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD NEVER WITNESS IN THIS COUNTRY BEYOND THE PHYSICAL ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EVEN SCARIER THAN ALL IN THAT EVEN MORE UNSETTLING THAN ALL OF THAT. IS THEREFUSAL OF SO MANY NATIONAL POLITICAL FIGURES TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRED TO BE WILLING TO CALL THIS INSURRECTION. THIS VIOLENT ATTEMPT TO SUBVERT DEMOCRACY WHAT IT IS AND IN FACT OF THOSE WILLING TO DO IT ARE SO NOTICEABLE. RIGHT SO NOTICEABLE WHEN PEOPLE LIKE LIZ CHENEY AND KARL ROVE PEOPLE WHO MANY OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS ROOM HAVE OPPOSED AT EVERY STAGE OF THEIR POLITICAL CAREER IT'S SO NOTICE WHEN THEY'RE WILLING TO GET UP AND SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. AND BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THE WORK WE HAVE TO DO TO HEAL OUR DEMOCRACY TO COME TOGETHER TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN. THAT REQUIRES US TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. AND TO REFLECT ON HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I BELIEVE VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO WORK TO BUILD A STRONGER DEMOCRACY. AND THAT BEGINS BY ACKNOWLEDGING. THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX. BY HONORING THE BRAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO DIED. AND WHO WERE INJURED PROTECTING THE CAPITAL THAT DAY. BY SUPPORTING THE WORK OF THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AJ ARE TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MYSTERY WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE CO AUTHORS ON THE H. A R.

WHILE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AT BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY. FONTINA WAS ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD HE SAID IN THOSE SHORT FOURTEEN YEARS SHE MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON THOSE WHO KNEW HER. SHE WAS DESCRIBED BY HER FAMILY AS A SPECIAL GIRL WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE AND A NOBLE HEART. AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM SHEILA. WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SHE PROVED HERSELF CAPABLE OF ANYTHING SHE EXCELLED AT AND SHE EXCELLED IN HER HIGH SCHOOL. HIGH TECH L. A. AND LAKE BALBOA HI TECH HIGH SCHOOL COLLEAGUES IS WHERE I'VE HELD OF THREE- HIGH SCHOOL CHESS TOURNAMENTS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC OF BECAUSE IT WAS A PROGRAM THAT I STARTED WHEN I FIRST TOOK OFFICE AND I JUST WONDER IF GIVEN HERS INTEREST IN SCIENCE IF MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN. JOINING THE CHESS CLUB THIS YEAR AND MAYBE OUR PATHS WOULD HAVE CROSSED. AT OUR CORE VALENTINO WAS TALENTED KIND HEARTED AND A DREAMER WITH A SMILE SHE ALWAYS. SHE WAS ALWAYS HELPING OTHERS WHILE DREAMING OF BIGGER AND BETTER WAYS SHE COULD IMPACT OTHERS. SHE WAS FULL OF HOPES AND DREAMS THAT INCLUDED GETTING A JOB AS SOON AS SHE WAS ELIGIBLE TO SAVE UP FOR AND ATTENDED SANTA MONICA COLLEGE. SO THAT ONE DAY SHE COULD OPEN UP A FOUNDATION FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED HELP THE MOST OR BECOME AN ENGINEER TO DESIGN ROBOTS THAT CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE- INNOCENCE SELFLESS NATURE AND BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT REPRESENT. WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT OUR YOUTH. AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY THAT SHE WAS TAKEN SO YOUNG. VALENTINA IS SURVIVED BY A LOVING FAMILY WHO WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HER AS AN EXCELLENT DAUGHTER SISTER. COUSIN NIECE AND GRANDDAUGHTER. MISTER SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD SOMETHING TO THIS IDEA I READ THIS STATEMENT BECAUSE A WEEK AGO. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL AND SPEAK WITH VALENTINA'S PARENTS WHICH IS A CALL THAT. NONE OF US REALLY WANT TO EVER MAKE. WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT MY CONVERSATION WITH HER IS THAT. I WELL UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS FAMILY. MY PARENTS AND I IMMIGRATED HERE LEAVING THE WAR TORN COUNTRY. HER PARENTS LEFT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF LIMITED OPPORTUNITY AND WANTED TO BRING THEIR BOTH OF THEIR DAUGHTERS HERE SO THAT THEY WOULD EXCEL. GIVEN THEIR TALENTS AND ABILITIES AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE EXCEL. SHE WAS HERE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T EVEN GET AN OPPORTUNITY. EXCEL. THAT IN ITSELF. IS ONE PART OF THE STORY YET THE OTHER IS AS A PARENT MYSELF OF THREE CHILDREN WHEN I GO OVER EVERY SINGLE FIBER OF THEIR HAIR. I CAN JUST NLY IMAGINE I DON'T EVEN WANT TO IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU LEAVE YOUR COMFORT ZONE IN THE COUNTRY YOUR AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR CHILDREN. EMIGRATE COME INTO A NEW PLACE WHERE YOU NEED TO LEARN AND REHASH EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN AND REBUILD JUST TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THEN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. SO IT IT'S THIS IS THIS THIS. TRAGIC SITUATION HAS STRUCK ME UP PERSONALLY VERY MUCH AND I NEEDED TO EXPRESS THAT. PARENTS AND- I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WOULD WANT ME TO EXPRESS ON HER BEHALF AND SO THE NOTES THAT I READ.
