NEW CAT JOINT HEARING RIGHT NOW. A CONCURRENT WITH THIS HEARINGS TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS ARE OVER THERE.

THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR INDICATE TWELVE A SCHOOL SYSTEM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE'VE SEEN SOME. IMPROVEMENTS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THROUGH FOR EARLY EDUCATION WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT. GOING FORWARD AND THIS BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS THEM. I TRANSPARENCY MEASURES TO INCREASE. THE EL CAP OVERSIGHT WHICH IS CERTAINLY A GOOD THING BY NO THERE ARE MORE. IDEAS AS WELL. I KNOW WE HAVE. SOME ON GOING QUESTIONS ON SOME LARGER ISSUES BUT THIS IS OF COURSE THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WITH THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING ANY OPENING COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HEARING NONE SO FIRST WE LIKE TO BRING UP. AS USUAL OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION FOR CITY CALIFORNIA A TOM TOWARDS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. GLAD TO BE HERE THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET WE CAN SAY A GREAT BUDGET AND IT'S SO GREAT TO BE HERE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TO. INVEST FURTHER IN MAJOR SIGNIFICANT WAYS IN EDUCATION AND SUPPORTING ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN STUDENTS. IT'S GREAT TO BE BEFORE YOU AS WE TALK ABOUT MAKING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. I REMEMBER ALL TOO WELL THE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU REMEMBER THEM AS WELL. TERRIBLE TIMES IN TERMS OF CUTBACKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL. COUNTIES AS WELL AS IN OUR DEPARTMENT IN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS YOU MAY RECALL I IN MY FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE DECLARED A STATE OF FISCAL EMERGENCY. YEAH WE HAD ALREADY. SEEN THE LAYOFF OF THIRTY THOUSAND TEACHERS WERE THREATENED WITH ANOTHER TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND TEACHERS BEING LAID OFF WE. SAW TWENTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIED TEACHERS. DO CLASSIFIED STAFF ALSO. LAID OFF AND A LOT OF PROGRAM'S DISMANTLED IN ARTS MUSIC AND. DRAMA AND CIVICS AND SCIENCE AND SO. WHERE IT'S IN SUCH A MUCH BETTER TIME? AND WE MADE MUCH PROGRESS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THAT I'M EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. AND AS THE CHAIRMAN UNDERSCORED AS PROGRESS. BUT ALSO ROAD MAP MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS. COMPREHENSIVELY THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. MOST RECENTLY. AS NEW STATE POLL SHOWS GREAT GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE STATE IN A RECENTLY LAUNCHED. SCHOOL REPORT CARD. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. IS RECEIVING FIND REVIEWS FROM THE PUBLIC ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THOSE SURVEYED SIXTY ONE PERCENT LIKE THE INFORMATION THE DASHBOARD GIVES. AND FELT IT WAS EASY TO USE. WE ALWAYS THOUGHT FOCUSING ON MULTIPLE MEASURES IS A BETTER THAN FOCUS IN A ONE ONE OR TWO NUMBERS. MORE IMPORTANTLY A RECENT REPORT FROM THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE FOUND THAT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. FROM LC FF HAVE LED TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE. AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. PARTICULARLY AMONG CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE NEED. ISRAEL NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN CURRENT PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT. BUT WITH ALSO. DO MORE TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE READY FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THIS COMMITTEE. ONGOING IN THESE EFFORTS. I AM PLEASED THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. NEAR SU CHI HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TWENTY TWO EIGHTY. THAT THE SENATE HAS A PROPOSAL AS WELL BUT IT ADDRESSING. THESE NEEDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO LOOK AT HOW WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE ENSURING FUNDING FOR LCF F. NOW THAT WE ARE NO LONGER IN TRANSITION. CD FUNDING YOU JUST CAME IN YOU MENTIONED. TREAT THE OTHER HEARING THIS. WORKING ON THIS DAY. I KNOW THAT YOU JUST CAME FROM THAT HEARING AND LOOKING AT THE FUTURE IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY FUTURE. OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. SO I WILL ONLY ADD A FEW POINTS TO AND WHAT YOU HEARD IF YOU WERE IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING AND AND. GO BEYOND WHAT OF OUR CHAIRMAN. MCCARTY HAS SAID I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROVIDING FUNDING FOR C. TO EAT MORE HOWEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE EDUCATION TRAINING. AND SKILLS OUR YOUTH NEED. EXCEED. UNDER THE SEEDIER SIDE OF GRANT PROGRAMS SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE AND EXPAND CT PROGRAMS. DRIVEN BY CURRENT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LABOR MARKET DATA. STUDENT INTEREST AND ALIGNMENT WITH PROGRAMS OFFERED IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. I'M MOST INTERESTED IN HAVING AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT ENABLES ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TO GRADUATE. FROM HIGH SCHOOL READY FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. AND THAT WE PROVIDE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT AND EXPLORATION OF BOTH THE COLLEGE AND CAREER SIDE OF THINGS. WE DON'T WANT TO LIMIT CHOICES. I DO BELIEVE THAT MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL IS TAKING. IN THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE CD FUNDING AND DEVELOP MORE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS. AND THAT WOULD BE A BILL AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. AS. CD PROGRAMS. NEED THAT FURTHER INVESTMENT. STATEWIDE SYSTEM A SUPPORT IS ANOTHER TOPIC I'M PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR PROVIDING SEVENTY MILLION IN THE STATE FUNDS FOR THIS SYSTEM. INCLUDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION TO HELP COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES USING THE DATA FROM THE DASHBOARD TO GUIDE POLICIES AND ACTION. WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR EDUCATION PARTNERS AT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE CT THIS CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE OF EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND SAY CESA IN THE STATE WAS. AGENCIES GROUP TO WORK TOGETHER ALIGNED IT AWAY AS I'VE SEEN AT AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE COOPERATION BETWEEN THESE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AGENCIES GROUP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS ALIGNED WITH WHAT WILL TRULY HELP CREATE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. WE KNOW THERE IS MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO BETTER ALIGN SERVICES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO. FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE ON HOW WE CAN USE FEDERAL FUNDING. TO BUILD ON THE STATE'S COMMITMENT. SPECIAL EDUCATION I KNOW IT'S A TOPIC WE'RE ALL. DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT. WAS AGAIN VERY PLEASE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION IS JUST ONE AREA IMPACTED BY THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. AND I'M LOOKING TO THE STATE DIVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THOSE OTHER AREAS SUCH AS STEM AND BILINGUAL EDUCATION. NOW IN FACILITIES FACILITIES BOND I'M GLAD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR. SAYING THAT HE WILL INCREASE MORE BOND FUNDING. FOR SCHOOLS WE KNOW HOW DESPERATELY SCHOOLS NEED. TO REHABILITATE BUILDINGS AND MODERNIZE BUILDINGS MAKE THEM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. I URGE YOU TO PROVIDE EVEN MORE BOND FUNDING FOR DESPERATELY NEEDED. WE HAVE AND MODERNIZATION AND FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. AS I TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE STATE I SEE FIRSTHAND THE DIRE NEEDS IN THIS AREA. EARLY EDUCATION. WE KNOW EARLY EDUCATION WORKS PROVIDING EDUCATION AND CARE TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS IS ANOTHER AREA. THAT IS NICE TO BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO QUALITY SETTINGS FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. BUT ESPECIALLY FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. I AM PLEASE AT THE GOVERNOR IS MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO INCREASE RATES AND SLOTS. I'LL CONCLUDE WITH A LOOK AT MY VISION AND GOALS FOR THIS FINAL YEAR IN THIS OFFICE. I'M DEFINITELY NOT TAKEN A SLOW WALK TO THE FINISH LINE SOME OF YOU NO I LIKE TO JOG ON THAT. TRACK RUNNER GUY. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO JUST KEEP RUNNING OF FULL SPEED THERE LOTS OF THINGS I STILL WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND STUDENT AND I'M GOING TO BE WORKING HARD TO ACCOMPLISH THEM OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. ON THE LEGISLATIVE FRONT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE% FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR OUR SCHOOLS INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN EARLY EDUCATION. CT AND FACILITIES. BEING FORTY FIFTH IN THE NATION IS NOT. WHERE CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE? IN PER PUPIL SPENDING AND I THINK YOU UNDERSCORE THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS WE WE DO NEED MORE FUNDING. THERE IS ANOTHER AREA THAT HAS BEEN A DRIVING FORCE THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AS A TEACHER AND COACH. A LEGISLATOR IN SUPERINTENDENT AND THAT IS STUDENT SAFETY AND HEALTH. TWO YEARS AGO I CONVENE A STATEWIDE. SCHOOL SAFETY COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT WAYS WE CAN BETTER PARTNER WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE. THERE ARE SCHOOLS ARE TAKEN THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS. THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES IN FLORIDA INNER. AND IN OUR OWN SANDRA DINO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES SHOWS NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT PLANNING. AND PREPARED BICU PLANNING AND PREPARED FOR WHATEVER EMERGENCY MIGHT OCCUR. WELL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING. IMPORTANTLY AS WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE WE ARE ADDRESSING THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR STUDENTS. FROM PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS AND HEALTH CARE. AND NEVER BEFORE MORE IMPORTANT NOW MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. IT IS IMPERATIVE. THAT WE PROVIDE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS HAS COME UP MORE AND MORE OVER AND OVER. FREQUENTLY WHERE EVER I MEET WITH EDUCATORS. EDUCATION. ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERS. AND PARENT GROUPS AND IMPORTANTLY. WHEN I TALK WITH STUDENTS. IN RECENT MONTHS IT HAS COME UP IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SETTING I'VE BEEN IN. STUDENTS KNOW THEY NEED MORE SUPPORT TO HELP THEM COPE AND MANAGE THE DAILY STRESSES OF THEIR LIVES. BUT ALSO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. ARE COMING TO SCHOOL WHILE DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. THEY SEE THE NEED. FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR PEERS. TEACHERS AND STAFF SEE IT TOO AND THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS AND TO BETTER IDENTIFY WHEN STUDENTS NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. PARENTS ALSO PUT SAFETY AND SCHOOL CLIMATE AT THE VERY TOP OF THEIR PRIORITIES. SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IN IT. THAT IT WAS THE TOP PRIORITY INTERNET SOURCE SURVEY FROM LAST FALL. THE WORLD IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PLACE FOR YOUTH TODAY. THEY'RE FACING CHALLENGES AND ISSUES. BUT I CERTAINLY NEVER IMAGINED. NOR DID THE PREVIOUS GENERATION. I AM HOPING. THAT WE'RE WE CAN PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. AND AT THE STATE LOCAL LEVELS I'M HOPING TO GET MORE FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT MY STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO STAFF AND STUDENTS. RELATEDLY KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL CULTURE AND SCHOOL CLIMATE IS IMPORTANT EVERYONE SAFE SCHOOLS MATTER. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT STUDENTS FEEL CONNECTED TO THEIR SCHOOLS. I AM GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR HIS AUTHORSHIP. OF AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THAT WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS WITH TOOLS TO BETTER ADDRESS THE OVERALL SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR VIEWS AND OUR GOALS. THIS AFTERNOON I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE TO ENSURE RESOURCES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE AVAILABLE. WITH THAT GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND. I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK YOU DO. IN THIS COMMITTEE. THANK U. SUPERINTENDENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ALTHOUGH ITALIA. I NEXT LET'S BRING UP THE. PANEL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OAK BEFORE IT BEFORE YOU LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR SUPERINTENDENT. YES MISTER MARTZ EGYPT WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. AS YOUR LAST A. OPENING A ADDRESS TO OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT WANTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR MANY YEARS OF. OF BEING A CHAMPION FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I WANTED TWO WERE. HAVING SAID THAT. YOU KNOW. I I FEEL THAT I'M I'M FACING A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE WITH THE WHAT I'M WORKING ON WITH. MANY OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS. HERE AND SACRAMENTO IN TRYING TO LOOK BEYOND. OF THE FOR FUNDING THE PROPOSED FULL FUNDING OF. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. HOW DO WE GET FROM? JUST GETTING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO FULL AND FAIR FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOL. DISTRICTS AND AND I REALIZE BOTH FROM AT THE CHAIRS OPENING REMARKS AS WELL AS YOUR OPENING REMARKS. THAT. I AM FIGHTING AGAINST THE THE THE PREVAILING NARRATIVE IN SACRAMENTO THAT THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET. FOUR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION WHEN IN FACT YOU KNOW WE. THERE WE ARE. DEALING WITH DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE BETTER TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT THEM. PROJECTIONS OF DEFICIT SAY YEAR OUT OR TWO YEARS OUT. WITH THE. RAPIDLY RISING COSTS. NOW WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS ARE PENSION COSTS OR. NO. HEALTH CARE COSTS THAT ALL ALL THE COSTS THAT. THAT EVERYONE IN THE REAL WORLD HAS TO FACE THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE NARRATIVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN WHAT THE OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARE ARE ARE TELLING US. AS AS WE WELL. MOVED BEYOND THE. PROPOSED. FULL FUNDING OF THE LOCA DRAW FUNDING FORMULA. OF THIS US ONE POINT THE SECOND POINT IS YOU KNOW I I FEEL THAT. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FULL AND ADEQUATE FUNDING OF OF ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. THE NEED FOR FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF HOW THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR. FORMALLY DOLLARS PACIFIC LEE THE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE. THE US MUST BE ALLOCATED FOR OUR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS YOU KNOW HOW EXACTLY THAT THAT IS TO BE SPENT AND SO. MISTER SUPERINTENDENT WANT TO ASK YOU FIRST WITH ON THAT POINT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE INCREASING GUY GRADUATION RATES. AND AND THE. ACHIEVEMENTS THAT WE ARE RECEIVING SEEING AND AND OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. BUT. WITHOUT DATA AS TO HOW THE SUPPLEMENT ON CONCENTRATION DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT HOW'RE YOU ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE. THOSE. ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO. WOULD BE. LOW CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THANK YOU. SIMILAR FOR THOSE QUESTIONS OF THOSE COMMENTS THIS IS THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT I DESCRIBED. IS ONE WAY WE'RE GETTING THE DATA ANALYZING THE DATA DISK SCHOOLS ARE SHARING DATA AS HEARING STRATEGIES BEST PRACTICES. I IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE THE OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS A CHALLENGE AND WEAK CONTINUALLY WORK FOR THAT TRANSPARENCY AND FOR DISTRICTS TO SHARE. AND I IN ALL MY YEARS IN EDUCATION AS LONG NUMBER OF. THOSE YEARS I I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN THIS LEVEL OF COOPERATION EVER BEFORE. AND THROUGH THE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATION EXCELLENCE WE HAVE MANY PILOT PROGRAMS GOING ON WE HAVE MANY. HELPING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING GROUPS GOING ON AND. THEY'RE HELPING EACH OTHER WITH PEER SUPPORT AND AGAIN BEST PRACTICES SO IT'S IT'S CRITICAL TO. I MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S. SUPPORT AND TRANSPARENCY IS PART OF THAT. THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF OUR SCHOOLS OF A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. THE BOND MEASURES LOCALS DISTRICTS PUTTING FOR OTHER VOTERS IN THE LAST ELECTIONS AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE PASSED. AND OF COURSE THEY PASSED THE PROP FIFTY ONE AND. AND PROP FIFTY FIVE. I BUT IT'S CRITICAL THEY TRANSPARENCY YOU SPOKE OF AND FINALLY. ON YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. ADD TO BE FORTY FOUR TO FORTY FIFTH IN THE NATION IS NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT. THAT WE NEED TO AIM FOR THE TOP GET RIGHT BACK TO THE TOP OR CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN THE PAST IN INVESTING IN OUR KIDS IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. ALSO WANNA THANK AS SUPERINTENDENT FOR ALL HIS YEARS OF SERVICE. I I REMEMBER WELL AND AND FINALLY YOUR VISIT TO. RIVERSIDE TO. OUT TWICE RIGHT RIVERSIDE POLY FOR THE DEAF. AS WELL BOTH AND RIVERSIDE. SO WHEN I SAY THANK YOU. YEAH FORTY FOUR FORTY FIFTH IS NO PLACE TO BE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS GET. THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO. THE YEAR AHEAD WORKING WITH THE WITH YOU IN THE DEPARTMENT ON A. DIFFERENT LEGISLATION AS WELL. THANK YOU. THEY PUT ME JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION I JUST ASKED OVER AT THE CT  <u><c.green>HEARING. YES SO.</c></u> THERE IS THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE AND IT WAS THAT YEAR TO YEAR TO SING IT WAS GONNA EXISTENCE SO. GRANTED TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE. MAY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT MAYBE WE CAN GO NORTH WILL LOOK AT THAT. BUT THERE IS SOME CONCERN AS FAR AS WHETHER IT'S DOWN THROUGH THE COMMUNICABLE JUST IS THERE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF BAD. OUT WHAT ONE THING THAT I I'D BEEN CONTINUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT. IT WILL WHOEVER OVERSEAS IT IT IF YOU KNOW THERE'S A THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOLS ARE SAU IN CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU'RE. YEAH IF YOU'RE IN A HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU'RE IN A HIGH SCHOOL VARSITY IF YOU'RE IN A HIGH SCHOOL IT'S IN THE CONSORTIUM THAT SCORES WELL DID YOU DO WELL. IN THE OLD DAYS OF THE CATEGORICAL EVERY SCHOOL GOT A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY SO IF YOU'RE A KID AT SCHOOL YOU YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY GET SOMETHING SO. ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HELP EVERY THAT'S EQUALITY. AND THAT EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IF THEY WANTED TO GO CUT IN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW FLIP A COIN TO SEE IF THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT HIGH SCHOOLER MOVE ACROSS TOWN OR. DO YOU KNOW IN OUR DISTRICT TRANSFER WHAT HAVE YOU. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT IT EVERY SINGLE. NIGHT SIGHTS EVERY KID CAN CAN PARTICIPATE IF HERE SHE WANTS TO. THAT'S THE GOAL THAT THE THE BEST FORM OF THAT GOAL. AND IT EFFORT NEEDS TO BE TO KEEP FIGHTING THOSE WAYS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE. CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND INCREASE THEIR OVERALL SUCCESS SO. VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT THAT'S GOING ON THE COLLABORATIVE WORK THE TEAMWORK. DE AGAIN IT'S UNPRECEDENTED FROM WHAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE PAST IS NO PANACEA BUT IT IS. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO I DO THINK WE NEED TO. RAISE THE BASE ND HAVE ALL VOTES RISE AND. THAT WILL I THINK HELP. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE AYE I'VE TRAVELED A LOT AND TALK FREQUENTLY VISIT FREQUENTLY WITH THE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SUPERINTENDENTS AND TEACHERS UP IN THE MOUNTAINS IN THE THE CASE THE COUNTY FOR THEY HAVE ONE SCHOOL FOR THE WHOLE COUNTY AND. TAKES A A BUS A. FLEET TO TRAVEL EVERY DAY AND MOVE THE STUDENTS. FROM MARIPOSA COUNTY THEY TRAVEL. FROM HERE TO AKRON OHIO. EQUIPMENT MILES DRIVE DRIVING EVERY DAY TO GET THERE STUDENTS TO SCHOOL SO MANY OF THESE YOUTH BY CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE GETTING IS FULL OF ACCESS IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WE'RE WORKING OUT A REACHING OUT AND WORKING WITH THEM TO. SHARE BETTER ACCESS. THANK YOU THAT LET'S BRING UP NOW OUR PANEL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOT AND CD OKAY START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON LISA RESENTS GET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE HANDOUT THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IT'S A TWO PAGE DOCUMENT WILL KIND OF OUTLINE. MY PRESENTATION SO A FIRST OF ALL I WILL GO OVER THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT ARE THAT HE HOBBIES OUT HERE IS THE CUP THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE A CHART THAT EVERYONE WANTS THE FINANCE CHARGE ONCE A YEAR I SURE APPRECIATE YOU. SAYING THAT YES. YEAH. SO IF I MAY OUT WILL START IF YOU'RE ONE WHICH IS THE OF THE CHARTS SO I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OUT FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND WILL COVER SOME OF THE MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSALS I'M OBVIOUSLY THERE'S OTHER PROPOSALS AND WE DO HAVE. COLLEAGUES IN STAFFORD THERE WILL BE MORE THAN WILLING TO ANSWER ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS BEYOND WHAT I OFFER. SO THE FIRST CHARGES GIVES YOU A HISTORICAL FUNDING TREND ANALYSIS OF A WHERE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT HAS BEEN OVER THE YEARS. AND THOSE OF THE BLUE BARS IN ADDITION THAT PINK LINE SHOWED YOU WERE REVENUES ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR THE MOST PART OF HISTORICALLY THROUGH THE YEARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. HAS HISTORICALLY TRACKED WITH INCREASES AND DECREASES WITH IT WITH REVENUES. I'M I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT OF THE MAJOR DROPPED THE YOU SEE AN ELEVEN TWELVE WHICH IS LIKE THE END OF THE THE RECESSION. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WAS SENT FUNDED AT FORTY SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON AND THE PER PUPIL SPENDING ON ELEVEN TWELVE WAS THAT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. UP. FROM THE LOW POINT ELEVEN TWELVE ON THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE GROW SUBSTANTIALLY PRIMARILY AGAIN TO THIS INCREASE IN REVENUES. AND WHERE WE ENDED UP TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS AT SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE PER PEOPLE SPENDING IS ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THAT THE FORTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREASE IN THAT TIME PERIOD. SO IN FIGURE TWO OF THIS JUST SHOWS YOU THE THREE YEAR WINDOW OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOT GUARANTEE THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET. OF THE FIRST AGAIN WERE SEEN INCREASES IN A. GENERAL FUND REVENUES COME IN ADDITION WERE SEEN SOME NOTABLE INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAX. IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WITHOUT REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE. AND IT REVENUES DROP JUST SLIGHTLY BUT THE MOOD OF THE THE BIGGER PICTURE REALLY IS AN INCREASE IN REVENUES. ARE THESE REVENUES RE UP PROPERTY TAX REVENUES REFLECT THE COUNTY OTHER CONTROLLERS REPORTED AMOUNTS. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THE ASSESSED VALUES A PROPERTIES CAME A LOT HIGHER THAN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. NOT THAT INCREASE CARRIES THROUGH TO ALL THREE YEARS AND SO WE SEE THE BENEFIT OFFSETTING THE GENERAL FUND FOR ALL THREE OF OUR ESTIMATE YEARS. AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE I CAN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A ONE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN REVENUES A MINIMUM GUARANTEE ENDS AT SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION IN THIS CURRENT ESTIMATE WHICH IS SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION HIGHER THAN OUR LAST FORECAST. AND FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RECEIVED A GENERAL FUND REVENUES ABOUT THIRTY FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. ON THAT'S NEARLY SIX BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN OUR REVISED SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ESTIMATE AND AS A RESULT AGAIN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS ESTIMATED TO BE THREE POINT ONE BILLION MORE THAN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVISED. AND WE LANDED THE SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AWARE NOT CHANGING TESTS FOR CONTINUING TO BE ON THE TEST THREE YEAR HOWEVER WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MOVING INTO THE HAS TWO WHICH JUST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL WILL BE IN A TEST TO YEAR. SO I'M AND I AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD KINDA LIKE TO NOTE. IN THIS PROCESS AS WE MOVE TOWARD ME REVISION ANY INCREASES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE WILL NOT IMPACT THE GUARANTEE THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. A BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FACTORS SIR ARE SET UP THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE THE REVENUE IT'S GONNA BE LIMITED TO THE BALANCE OF WHAT IS ON THE MAIN ITS FACTOR BALANCE. SO THAT'S ABOUT TO TURN TWENTY MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. AND I EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THERE ARE A FEW OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN CHANGE HOW WE DON'T. ANTICIPATE THEM INTO CHANGING TOO MUCH BUT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TURNOUT AND AND I KNOW THE LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT THE RECENT RECENT REVENUE FORECAST JUST SO YOU KNOW IN EDUCATION. THERE MAY NOT BE A BENEFITS THAT. THE NO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S PER HOW YOU'D SCORE IT. VERSES IN NINETY EIGHT BUT. WHAT IT DOES DAHLE BE? MORE ONGOING THAN ONE TIME PERCHED TOO LATE EARLY TELL THEIR AT MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULD NOT WILL NOT INCREASE VERY MUCH AT ALL SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU APPROPRIATE FUNDS THAT ARE OUTSIDE. AND AND YOU KNOW NOT CALCULATED THE MEN AND GUARANTEE YOU CHRIS MOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED BAR UP THE FOLLOWING YEAR BUT. NO WE REALLY I'M AND I BELIEVE THE LA AGREES ON THIS POINT WITH ARE FACTORS THAT. INCREASE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PROBABLY MAXES OUT AROUND TWO TWENTY AND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND A THREE HUNDRED MILLION. REGARDLESS OF IF THE REVENUES GO UP SIX BILLION IT'LL. THAT WILL BE THE INCREASE. SO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET MIGHT BENEFIT RETURN MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THEY WERE GETTING A OF THIS FUNDING OKAY I'M SO UP. ON THE SECOND PAGE ON IS WHERE I GIVE YOU A PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FIGURES THREE I JUST SUMMARIZES THE VALUABLE FUNDING SOURCES OF THE FIRST YEAR THEY AND CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE THAT I HAD HIGHLIGHTED ON THE OTHER PAGE. ON THEN ADDITION I'M IN A PROP NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE ONE TIME RESOURCES THAT BECOME AVAILABLE I'M WHEN WE SPEND ONE TIME MONEY. SOME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SAVINGS ALSO ON THOSE TOTAL ABOUT SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL AVAILABLE RESOURCES. AND THEN IN ADDITION OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A ONE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. A SETTLER. PAYMENT OF THIS IS A PROP TO DEBT PAYMENTS AND IT'S WE'VE PAID IT TOWARDS THE SUBTLE AB OUTSTANDING SETTLER. SO IN FIGURE FOUR. THERE'S THE DETAILED LIST OF THE SPENDING IN THE GOVERNORS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE FIRST PART IS THE KEY TWELVE EXPENDITURES. ARE IN THE SPENDING PLAN IN THE SECOND PART IS COMMUNITY COLLEGES I DON'T PLAN ON GOING OVER COMMUNITY COLLEGES AGAIN SINCE YOU WENT OVER YESTERDAY AND OVERHEARING. I'M IN THE ONE TIME SPENDING FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AGAIN WE WE WE TRY TO TAKE A BALANCED APPROACH WITH THE ONE TIME AN ON GOING THE LARGEST ONE TIME AGAIN ISN'T DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN WOULD GO OUT TO ALL THE LIAISON AT EIGHTY A BASIS. ARM AND TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE OUTSTANDING MANDATE. ADAM BALANCES THE IT WOULD BE APPLIED TOWARDS AS OUTSTANDING BALANCES. STATE THE NEXT TO. BUT THAT SUPERINTENDENT ACTUALLY DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF DISCUSSING THESE PROPOSALS BUT HE NEXT TO RELATED TO A SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE WHEN THE DASHBOARD RELEASED IN THE FALL OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT BECAME HIGHLIGHTED WAS THAT OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT DISTRICTS. I IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE UMPS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OR TWO THIRDS WERE IDENTIFIED AS WERE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SO AS PART OF THIS PLAN WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE PICKED A COUPLE PROPOSALS IN ORDER TO KIND OF. HOW IMPROVE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES? SO THE FIRST ONE IS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION KINDA TARGETED AND. EARLY INTERVENTION AND THESE ARE COMPETITIVE GRANTS THAT WOULD GO OUT. TO UP TO. SPANS THE. INCLUSIVE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS FROM ZERO TO FIVE POPULATION. THE OTHER IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT'S TO TEACHER ARE GRANTS BOTH COMPETITIVE GRANTS ONE IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND THE OTHERS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM. UP FOR THE ONGOING SPENDING AGAIN. AS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE% GOVERNOR HAVE PRIORITIZE IN THE PAST THE THE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IT IS FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WITH FEE INCREASES MY GUARANTEE WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD THAT INTO THE PLAN IS A THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. AND IMPLEMENTS THE LCF OUT TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. TOTAL. INVESTMENT AND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IS BEEN TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT BRINGS THE A TF UP TO SIXTY POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE CURRENT. AS AN. ANOTHER ONE TIME INVEST OUR ONGOING INVESTMENT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE HEARING BEFORE IS THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. AND IN THIS PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR'S I'M PLANNING TO. UTILIZE THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO SUPPORT K. TWELVE PROGRAMS IT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING TO CREATE THE K. TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE. AND AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MILLION IN ORDER TO BUILD TO FUND LOCAL INDUSTRY EXPERTS WHO WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELLIOTT IS. ADDITIONALLY I'M ON ON GOING AS THE A INCREASED SUPPORT IN THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. I'M ON FIFTH AND HAND OUT THAT HE GAVE YOU'LL SEE AT SIXTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION AND THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER PIECES TO IT. BUT THAT PEACE AND PARTICULARS THREE COMPONENTS. OUR ONE OF THEM IS FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION FOR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THEIR EXISTING EFFORTS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS ARE ALREADY GOING ON THIS WOULD EXPAND THOSE. ON FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALSO ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE THOSE ESPECIALLY TO THOSE THAT ARE IN NEED OF DIFFERENTIATED ASSIST. ON THE OTHER PART OF THAT COMPONENTS ARE IS A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR FOR COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION. AND IN TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. LOCAL AREA EXPERTS IN ORDER TO. THESE WILL BE COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND ESTABLISH REGIONAL EXPERTS IN THESE AREAS DIFFERENT AREAS THAT ARE NEEDED. HOLD ON ONE SEC. SO. I'M ALMOST FINISHED THINK. ADDITIONALLY ON THE STATE'S ISN'T AS PRECLUDES THE EFFORTS OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE THIS PLANNING PROVIDE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING AND THEN UTILIZES A SAVINGS AT THAT AT THAT WAS FOUND IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET APPOINTMENTS FIVE POINT SIX MILLION. ON. ADD TO SUPPORT THE COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OTHER ANOTHER. THE FOUR POINT THE FORTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION FOR PRESCHOOL IS SPEED THE LAST. PAYMENT I WANT IS A PAIN BUT IT'S THE FOOD JUST REFLECTS THE FINAL MULTI YEAR. UP PAYMENT IN MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT. AND SO. AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO COVER CAMINO COLLEGES BUT. ALL THE DETAILS ARE THERE SO IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T COVER I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LA OF. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KENNETH COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE TRICKIER. PARTS OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS REALLY A MOVING TARGET THE FORMULAS DEPEND ON NEARLY A DOZEN DIFFERENT INPUTS. AND THOSE INPUTS CHANGE REALLY WITH EVERY BUDGET UP TO IT. ARE TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF OUR HAND OUT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THIS YEAR'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. AS YOU HEARD THE KEY FACTOR IN THE INCREASES IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GUARANTY IS OUR THE REVISED US REVISED ESTIMATES. UPPER DIVISION THIS TO GENERAL FUND REVENUE. I WANT OTHER KEEFE FACTOR WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WAS KEY TWELVE ATTENDANCE AT THE ADMINISTRATION AND PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED A SMALL ATTENDANCE INCREASE HEARD A DECLINE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ARE THEY NOW ESTIMATE A SMALL INCREASE. AND THAT'S. A REALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ON. EVEN A MINOR ATTENDANCE INCREASE IN ONE YEAR AYE TRIGGERS A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. AND THAT PROVISION EFFECTIVELY CANCEL THE EFFECT OF ATTENDANCE DECLINES DURING THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS SO EVEN THOUGH ATTENDANCE IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT. OF A PERCENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SMALL INCREASE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COUNCILS THAT. AFFECTING THE CALCULATION OF THE GUARANTEE. BOB I THINK YOU ALSO HEARD ABOUT THE STATE'S MAINTENANCE FACTOR OBLIGATION AS YOU NO MAINTENANCE FACTOR IS REALLY THIS CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT TO MAKE CATCH UP PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS. A TO MAKE UP FOR REDUCTIONS DURING TIGHTER FISCAL TIMES I SIX YEARS AGO THAT OBLIGATION STOOD AT RIGHT AROUND TEN POINT SIX BILLION. SO REDUCING IT NOW TO WITH GOING TO TWENTY MILLION AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I THINK AS A MARKER OF THE STATE'S A FISCAL PROGRESS OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. I JUMPING AHEAD TO PAGE THREE. QUE TWELVE FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF AROUND FOUR PERCENT OVER THE REVISED TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVEL. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WOULD MARK THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF INCREASES IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. THAT IS TIED FOR THE LONGEST STREAK SINCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. ARE TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET I CONTAINS A TOTAL OF ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION IN NEW THAT IT'S RELATED AND FUNDED THROUGH THOSE INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEE. ARE BUT SOME OF THE FUNDS ALSO REFLECTS A FUNDS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY USED FOR SOMEONE TIME ACTIVITIES AYE THAT NOW ARE AVAILABLE FOR NEW COMMITMENTS AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. OF THE TOTAL SIX POINT THREE BILLION AVAILABLE ARE THE BUDGET ALLOCATES ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO NEW ON GOING COMMITMENTS AND ABOUT ONE THIRD TO ONE TIME CHARITIES AND INITIATIVES. TURNING TO PAGE. FIVE I THINK ADMINISTRATION OUR TO GIVE YOUR PRETTY GOOD WALK THROUGH OF WHAT'S IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE KEY COMPONENTS. LARGEST ONGOING TWO POINT NINE BILLION FOR L. CFF OF THE LARGEST ONE TIME ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION FOR THE ONETIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS. ON. IN ADDITION THE CT  <u><c.green>IN THE</c></u> COMMUNITY COLLEGES AUGMENTATION THAT AND YOU'RE COVERING IN SEPARATE HEARINGS TO ASK THOSE FOR NOW. AT PAGE SIX OF OUR HAND OUT IS JUST A LIST OF ALL THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I'VE REALLY COMPARE ABILITY ADMINISTRATION SHEET JUST ORGANIZED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. I TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN IN OUR ASSESSMENT I THINK OVERALL WHAT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS A GOOD MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING SPENDING. I THE IMPORTANCE OF RESERVING SOME FUNDING FOR ONE TIME INITIATIVES IS NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS AND GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES LIKE THE STATE IS AND HOW. BUT IF THE STATE WERE TO EXPERIENCE A DOWNTURN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I THAT APPROACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WOULD HELP THE STATE AVOID THE NEED FOR REDUCTION STILL CFF FOR SOME OTHER ONGOING PROGRAM. I TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A PREVIEW OF SOME OF OUR. OTHER MESSAGES TO HEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW HEARING THIS. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION I DESERVE SOME CREDIT FOR IT IDENTIFYING A GOOD SET OF PRIORITIES AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THE PROPOSAL'S AIMED AT EXPANDING CT  <u><c.green>ADDRESSING</c></u> SPECIALIZED STAFFING SHORTAGES. ON. GOT A SUPPORTING LOW PERFORMING DISTRICT THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF YOUR QUITE PRIORITIES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I THINK AYE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I WOULDN'T ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC UNDERLYING PROBLEMS IN THOSE AREAS AND SO IN FOR EACH OF THOSE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO HEAR US PROVIDE. SOME RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES TO YOU TO CONSIDER HOW THAT MIGHT TRY TO GET OUT SOME OF THOSE WHO ISSUE. ANOTHER CONCERN WE THINK THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE THE K. TWELVE MANDATE BACKLOG. THAT BACKLOG CURRENTLY STANDS AT AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE THAT AMOUNT WE ESTIMATE BY LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION. WE RECOMMEND YOU IDENTIFY A FINAL AMOUNT A FOR THE BACKLOG THAT COULD BE THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES COULD BE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT. AND THEN DISTRIBUTE AYE THAT AMOUNT ON A PER STUDENT BASIS AB BUT REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO WRITE OFF ALL OF THEIR REMAINING CLAIMS AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THAT FUNDING. THOUGHT TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT ON IN THEIR COMMENTS ON THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OUR OVERALL WE'RE REALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT IN OUR ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE ACROSS THE PERIOD. ARE COMPARED WITH OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK ON THAT A TOTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES IN THE BUDGET ESTIMATES ARE REALLY ONLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION ACROSS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ATTENDANCE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REALLY KEY THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILL BE LOOKING AT THE AVAILABLE DATA VERY CLOSELY LIKELY AVAILABLE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. SEE IF THAT HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONAL APPLY. IF IT DOESN'T THE EATING NINETEEN GUARANTEE COULD ACTUALLY DROP A FEW HUNDRED MILLION. I WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT CLOSELY AND KEEPING YOU UPDATED ON THAT ANALYSIS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S LOCAL PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES AND THAT'S BEEN A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN OUR. I NUMBERS IN THE PAST ADMINISTRATION IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN WHERE WE WERE IN NOVEMBER BUT WE THINK OVER ALL. THEIR NUMBERS ARE REASONABLE IN A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT GENERAL FUND REVENUE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES PERHAPS THREE BILLION OR MORE OVER SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ABBOTT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU AYE KRYPTONIAN MINISTRATION EVEN A REALLY LARGE INCREASE. THREE BILLION OR MORE ISN'T LIKELY TO INCREASE THE GUARANTEE IN EITHER YEAR ON BY MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED MILLION. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE AD THAT YOU HAD THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SAY A FEW WEEKS AGO. THAT. OF ANY NEW REVENUE MATERIALIZING IN MAY MOST OF THAT WILL BE DISCRETIONARY WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR PRIORITIES. UNLIKE IN PAST YEARS WHERE IT'S BEEN DEDICATED A. SCHOOLS THROUGH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AS SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SURE I CAN CAN YOU SPENT SOME MORE TIME THAT THE LAST POINT THAT YOU JUST MADE AND WHAT FINANCE SAID EARLIER. AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR THAT MAC TAYLOR PROJECTIONS WHAT YOU CATCHING US NOW IF THERE IF THERE THREE BILLION HIGHER COME MAY REVISE. ALMOST ALL OF IT. WOULD BE WOULD BE WHEN BE CALCULATED IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES THAT'S RIGHT SO ARE AT NOVEMBER. FISCAL OUTLOOK ESTIMATED THAT ACROSS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE REVENUE WOULD BE THREE POINT TWO BILLION HIGHER THAN WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW ACROSS THOSE TWO YEARS. A SENSE THAT TIME. SO FAR THE PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTS HOW ABOUT SOME INCREASED LOOKS LIKELY AYE JANUARY TAX COLLECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WERE ALREADY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION. HIGHER THAN THAT JANUARY BUDGET ESTIMATES. ON HIM WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE. RECENT TURBULENCE IN THE STOCK MARKET SORT OF CHANGES OUR OUTLOOK. AND WE DON'T THINK IT DOES AT THIS POINT AYE EVEN AT ITS LOWEST POINT OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. THE STOCK MARKET IS STILL ABOVE THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD ASSUMED WE DID OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK. SO EVEN IF THE MONEY'S COMMAND. FOR THAT. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. AND IT THERE ONE TIME MONIES THAT WOULD IT GOING TO THAT. NINETY EIGHT ONE TIME. LEDGER. SO THAT PREDICT THE GUARANTEE AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COULD INCREASE PERHAPS AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT'S PROBABLY SORT OF THE BEST CASE FOR THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND THAT INCREASE COULD ALSO CARRY FORWARD INTO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COULD BE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION HIGHER. I THAN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ESTIMATES AND IN THAT CASE IT WAS AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU WOULD HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL ONGOING MONEY TO WORK WITH. AND BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE. THE DYNAMIC THAT WE HADN'T SAY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WITH A GUARANTEE WERE STATE REVENUE INCREASED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE GUARANTEE WAS GOING ESSENTIALLY DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WITHOUT INCREASE. OKAY. AND THEN. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ONE. HAD. YEAH I TO ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT ARRIVING HEARING ON I THINK NEXT WEEK IS A SPECIAL ED AND A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD A HEARING ON. THAT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND SO SEEING THE PROPOSAL WHERE YOU KIND OF FAT. MERE THOSE TWO ISSUES WITH THE. WITH THE TEACHER RESIDENCY IDEA HERE WE WE HAD HEARINGS LAST FEW YEARS AND IN SOME OF THE MOST PROMISING IDEAS CAME FROM. THE. LP I LEARNING POLICY LIGHTS BUT THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO IT'S BEEN EMBRACED FOR. FOR GOT% SPECIAL ED. BUT IS IS THERE ALSO. AND OPENNESS TO LOOK AT THE IDEA AS. THAT EDUCATION AS A WHOLE BECAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE A TEACHER SHORTAGE IN. ALL THE AREAS ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST A SPECIAL AND. AND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW DISTRICTS HAVE TO PAY UP. THERE THEIR PIECES WELL AND YOU THINK AND GROW THEIR OWN SO IT'S BEEN ABOUT PROMISING ON SEVERAL FRONTS. I'M GOING TO DIRECT MY COLLEAGUE SHE'S OUR EXPERT IN. HI KIM LADY WITH THE DEPARTMENT. A FINANCE SOME DON'T LAST FEW BUDGETS HAVE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR A STEM BILINGUAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND MANY OF THE. GRANTEES HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH. PROPOSALS AND PROJECTS THAT WILL EMBRACE STEM AM BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND YET WE WE TEND TO SEE THAT THERE'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SO THESE THESE PROPOSALS ARE FOCUSED. RIGHT NOW ONLY ON SPECIAL EDUCATION I GET THAT BUT WHAT BY WHAT I ASKED IS. THE DEED THE BROADER PROPOSALS FOR THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WHERE. WHERE THERE ARE ON ON ALL AREAS AND IF REVENUES WERE AVAILABLE IS THAT IT IS THE? THIS ADMINISTRATION OPENED IT TO THESE APPROACHES AS WELL HOW LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT. TEACHER RESIDENCY IDEAS IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE JUST A NEW WANTS ONE FOR THIS TOPIC. BUT BUT OVERALL FOR ALL ALL SUBJECT AREAS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK. HAS MERIT. WELL THAT WILL BE A CONSIDERATION FOR THE MAY REVISION. THANK YOU. YES I KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO MUCH. THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR MEDINA. ON THE. ONE TIME SPENDING. THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE THE. IT'S MILLION. IS THAT A NEW ENTITY OR THAT EXISTS LAST YEAR. THE THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE HOME. YEAH YEAH YEAH I BELIEVE IT WAS AT IMPLEMENT WHEN ELSIE ITSELF WASN'T THIRTEEN SLANTED EYES AGAIN IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE. BOTH. THAT. ENTITY. AND THE. AND THE COUNTIES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BOTH. OVERSEE. THE SCHOOLS THAT. I I FORGET THE TERM IT THAT IS USE DIFFERENT A NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WHATEVER THE. THE TERM IS NEEDED DIFFERENTIATOR FOR IT YET. RIGHT SO. MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW ON WHAT BASES. BUT WHAT IS THE CRITERIA TO TO DECIDE. WHAT ENTITY SINCE THEY'RE BOTH? KIND OF DOING THE SAME THING CORRECT BOTH THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND THIS CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE. BOTH THEIR OVERSEEING SCHOOLS THAT NEED. A EXTRA HELP. ON WHAT BASIS DO YOU DO IS A DECIDED WHAT ENTITY DOES IT. EVER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THOSE ARE ACTUALLY DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW THAT I'M DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE BOARD HAVE A AN INTERSTATE MENTAL WORKING GROUP A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT'S CALLED I'M THE CONSISTS OF THE COUNTIES THAT. STATE FOR THE COLLABORATIVE DISTRICTS. SUBPLOTS ARE EVEN INVOLVED AND REALLY ASK THE STRUCTURE DEVELOPS WERE WORKING ON DEFINING THOSE CLEAR ROLES I'M OUR INTENT IS THAT COUNTIES WOULD BE THE FIRST LINE OF CONTACT IN THE CLOCK RATES ROLL WOULD REALLY BE ON. HELPING TO BUILD THOSE AT THE CAPACITY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME CASES THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES MAY BE. A LITTLE A LITTLE FRACTURED. AND SO THERE IS THE OPTION OF FOR THE COLLABORATIVE TO ALSO YOU TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE AS WELL BUT REALLY THE COUNTY OFFICES ARE GONNA BE THAT. FIRST POINT OF CONTACT. BUT I LIKE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ALREADY THERE. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE ALREADY THERE ALREADY HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. THANK YOU. MISTER ARTS ITCHING THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO. ASK A FEW QUESTIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. I I LIKE TO POSE THE SAME QUESTION BUT OPPOSE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT EARLIER WHICH IS THAT. YOU KNOW EVEN IN THESE. GUY GOOD BUDGET TIMES THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE. AND PROJECTING. DEFICITS A YEAR OR TWO OUT WITH A RAPIDLY INCREASING COSTS ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PENSIONS HEALTHCAR COSTS. WHAT WHAT IS THE YEAR THE END IN ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT COMPLEXITY HERE IS IS THAT? THE THE BASE GRANT IS INADEQUATE AS AS PART THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. OF BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY PORTION THAT IF THERE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED ON THOSE. RAPIDLY ESCALATING COST COMPONENTS. WAY WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ITS POSITION AS TO THEIR. VIA. IT WILL BE APPARENT REALITY THAT THEY WILL ONE DAY IF IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE DOES AGREE THAT IT THAT THERE ARE. SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE PROJECTING DEFICITS A EVEN IN THIS COULD BUDGET TIED TIMES INTO WHETHER WE. WHERE WAY WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSED TO? WAY WITH THESE THAT WAY WE WENT WITH THIS CHALLENGE. TRIP UP AARON IDIOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING INCREASING COSTS JUST LIKE MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET ARM I CAN'T SPEAK TO. V. THAT YOU AS YOU MENTIONED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WRECKING DEFICIT STUFF I JUST HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SEEN IDEA PERSONALLY. I THINK OUR RESPONSE THOUGH WOULD BE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THOSE IF F.. MY COLLEAGUE LISA MENTIONED THAT SINCE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE'VE NOW WITH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROPOSED BUDGET AND HAVE A TOTAL OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW ON GOING MONEY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVING UNDER THE LC FF AND. AND THAT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BASS GRANT TWO VERSES SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS I I THINK I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AS WELL THAT. STATUTE DOES IT IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH A SPENDING REQUIREMENT AS A REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES SO THERE IS SOME. IT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO. YOU'D BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THEIR EL CAP THROUGH THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THE INTENT THROUGH THE COMEDIAN GAUGE AND PROCESS THAT PAY HERE'S HOW WE'RE IMPROVING. SERVICES FOR THE STUDENTS IT MIGHT BE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. SITUATION IT MIGHT NOT BE I MEAN THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE KNOW WHAT THE INTENT WITH LOCAL CONTROL IS SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT THEIR ALL OF THEIR. COST PRESSURES WHATEVER THOSE MIGHT BE AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM IN A WAY THAT SADDAM. YOU KNOW NOT HAM STRINGING THEM AS I THINK WE WE WOULD VIEW THAT THE PREVIOUS YOU KNOW PRE LCF HAVE A STRUCTURE IS WHERE THEY DO JUST HAD. CATEGORICAL WASN'T SPECIFIC WAYS THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW HAD TO. DIRECT THOSE FUNDS AND NOW THEY HAVE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY SIT BACK AND YOU KNOW BE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE BE AT THE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TABLE FOR THEIR CAPS BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR FOR THEIR NEEDS SO IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SUGGESTING THAT. CONCENTRATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT TO ADDRESS PENSION COSTS AND. SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT SPECIFICALLY AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT WHEN I I JUST WOULD POINT OUT AGAIN THAT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A SPENDING REQUIREMENT THAT'S ALL I WAS ME SAY. BUT THE SPENDING REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS GO ONLY TO. THE THREE IDENTIFIED CATEGORIES OF DISADVANTAGED TO AND SINCE SO I WILL SAY I DON'T ON THE SHOWRUNNERS UNDERSTAND. I THINK. ALL I'M TRYING TO POINT OUT IS JUST THAT. YES THE FOR THE FUNDING IS DERIVED SPECIFICALLY FROM THOSE STUDENTS BUT THE STATUTE. DIRECTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO INCREASE OUR IMPROVE SERVICES AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. EXERCISES ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY. COULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HEALTH SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS MAY BE SPENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. CERTAINLY THROW SO ONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT COMES TO MIND I MEAN STATUTE IS THERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE I SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY BE TO HAVE A DISTRICT WIDE. CHANGE. ARE OR A PROJECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TO EMBARK ON AND. WELL YOU COULD SAIL DISTRICT WIDE OKAY THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR YOUR BASE RECORD OF STUDENTS THAT MAYBE AREN'T ON TO KEEP PEOPLE'S AND ALSO YOUR INDICATED PEOPLE'S AS WELL THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE IN AFFECTING AND. THERE IS SOME LEEWAY WITHIN THE EL CAP JUST TO TO DEMONSTRATE OKAY IT'S A DISTRICT WIDE BENEFIT BUT IT'S ALSO SPECIFICALLY GOING TO BENEFIT JUST THOSE UNDEFEATED PEOPLE'S AS WELL. AND NOTS. SOMETHING THAT THE STATUTE GIVES FLEXIBILITY TO LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO TO DO. WHETHER WHETHER TAKING FUNDING. DERIVE FOR THOSE STUDENTS BUT ALSO FUNDING FROM THE BASIN AND SAYING OKAY THIS IS A DISTRICT WIDE BENEFIT IT'S NOT ONLY. INCREASING INCREASING IMPROVING SERVICES FOR ALL YOUR UNDIVIDED PUPILS AND ALSO FOR YOUR. KNOWLEDGE. WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT THE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TELLING ME. THEIR THEIR AND AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A GUY OF A REAL CHALLENGE THAT TO. THE. THEN THAT DISTRICTS ARE FACING A. YEAH. OKAY. WELL THANK YOU AND I GUESS THIS IS ON. OUR OPENING ACTED SO WILL CERTAINLY. BE I WORKING THROUGH THESE FOR ISSUES FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND THEN COME BACK DURING THE MAY REVISED HAVE. BROADER DISCUSSION AS FAR AS THE FINAL ACTION I WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR PUBLIC COMMENT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS AND. GROUPS TO SHARE THEIR. REALLY PERSPECTIVE ON THE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET COULD RELATE TO PROP. NINETY EIGHT IN K. TWELVE THANK YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IT TOO MINURSO. GO AHEAD BILL. YEAH. YET WHERE YOU'RE GOOD OKAY. GUARDS. SO TO. WE THEY'RE ONLY A MEMBER. WE'RE ACTUALLY. GATES. I REGARDED. KIDS ARE DISADVANTAGED. NOW. THIRTY FOUR IS WHEN THE AYE IF THERE'S. ASK YOU TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE SAME. REPEAT THE POSSIBILITY OF. HAS REVEALED. ANNUAL. CARE THOSE WE. DIDN'T USE HERE. FOR ANY SPECIFIC REASON A LONG WAIT AND SEE PROHIBITED FROM. AND WE LIVE SELLERS ARE PRETTY IT ACTUALLY SHOWS EVIDENCE FROM THE S.. USE AND CONTINUOUSLY. BOB HOPE ORDERS. IS IT PAN. FOR SOME STORIES. ZAPPA CONTRARY. EARLIER. RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU. BAKER WE. AT FIFTY. SHARES OF CONCERNS ABOUT. TEST THREE BE CUT THAT HAD HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN THE STATE BUDGET AND YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A POSITIVE PRECEDENT TO MOVE FORWARD INCOMPLETE CUTTING. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC RECESSION PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT THAT WE DID NOT SEE CUTS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET AND WANTED TO CONTINUALLY REMIND. OUR COLLEAGUES WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE SEEKING A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF MONICA AND SURE THAT IF WE HAVE ANY TYPE OF BUDGET MISHAPS IN THE FUTURE. WE WOULDN'T SEE EDUCATION FUNDING HUNDRED IN ANYWAY WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT WE HAVE A CERTIFICATION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS SO WE CAN ALL AGREE ON WHAT ALL THE FACTS ARE. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATION IS PROPERLY FUNDED BY WE DO HAVE A FEW. ISSUES THAT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO A WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE DEDUCTION OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ONETIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS THAT WE ARE SET TO RECEIVE. AND BECAUSE OF MEDICAL NOT MEDI CAL BILLING AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT TALKING HAVE. REAL ENCROACHMENT INTO THE OVERALL FUNDS THAT WE'D BE RECEIVING WERE ALSO OPPOSED TO. FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AT THE INCREASE OF TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION IN CHARTER SCHOOL FUNDING IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF MONEY TO HAVE SEYMOUR. OVERSIGHT SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION FISCAL AND ACCOUNTING TRANSPARENCY FROM FURTHER. WE DO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AT YESTERDAY'S HEARING AT BY SOME REMEMBER MEDINA IN REGARD TO AYE RE ASKING FOR A POLICY HEARING ON THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET PROPOSAL WHILE DOESN'T IN YEAH SPECIFICALLY. INCLUDE K. TWELVE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD HAVE SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS NUMBER ONE ON. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS BUT WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE OTHER STUDENTS THAT COULD ATTEND WHICH COULD INCLUDE K. TWELVE TO A ROMAN STUDENTS WHO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PROPERLY. DISCUSS PARTY MOVING FORWARD AND ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SOME POLICY CONCERNS ABOUT THE KEY TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT MINISTRATION BY THE KING CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SINCE WE'D LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSS AN APOLLO BUT THERE'S MANY ITEMS OF. PORT ON OUR LADDER. AND THAT ACTUALLY GETS A SUPPORTS A FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE BEGAN RECOGNIZING THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL TAKE. TO GET US TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL AS THE ONE TIME ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDS THAT WOULD GO TO ALL LEDS TO ADDRESS. THE MYRIAD OF ISSUES THAT WE ALL FACE INTEREST OF COSTS ON A PRESSURES AND NEEDS LOCALLY AS WELL AS THE COLE LEFT FUNDING. UP ON THE WORK FORCE ISSUES THAT WERE. DETAILED TO BE DISCUSSED HERE FOR US IT'S REALLY LOOKING MORE BEYOND AND REALLY ENSURING THAT AL ELEAZAR HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF NOT JUST. IN PARTICULAR ROUTE TO SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT ALL BRANCHES OF THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT RECOGNITION. AND ON THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE SEVENTIES AS SIX MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS SYSTEM THAT WE REALLY ARE BUILDING IT UP WHERE THE COUNTY OFFICES CAN PROVIDE ALL ELLIE IS WITH THE SUPPORT. AND THAT WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE AT THIS NEW AT THE CC  <u><c.green>SO THAT</c></u> THEY CAN GO OUT AND AND PROVIDE US WITH EXTENDED AN INFORMATION AND RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CHAI SURPRISED THAT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT TWO AND THIRTY THOUSAND CLASS BY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. I WOULD JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS AT THIS EARLY STAGE IN YOUR OVERVIEW. ONE NIGHT DON'T THINK IT'S A HOP MENTIONED YET THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS A MINIMUM GUARANTEE. SO I THINK THERE'S NO PROHIBITION FOR YOU TO BREAK THAT CEILINGS ON SPEAK IT'S A FLOOR NOT A CEILING. NOW THE IDEA IS THAT WE A PREACHER APPRECIATE ALL THE INVESTMENT IN HOUSE SCHOOLS OVER THESE YEARS. BUT I THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RECOGNITION OF THE WORK OF THE CLASSIFIED STAFF. AND WE WOULD URGE YOU WHAT IS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION ON OTHER AREAS OF FIND WAYS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND SPECIAL EDUCATION OUTREACH FOR EXAMPLE. THAT CLASSIFY STAFF OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELP THOSE CHILDREN ONE ON ONE IF YOU WANTED TO BE MAINSTREAM. HOW MEMBERS OF THE ONE TO STAND BETWEEN DOES HAVE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS? AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T HARM THEMSELVES. AND SO WE ARE INTO MENTAL AND DOES BECAUSE A PROGRAM AND WE DO THINK FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TALK ABOUT EQUITY. FOR FOOD IN THE LCF AFTER DISTILLING NEED A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR IT ADEQUATE. TRANSPORTATION ACOSTA ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SOME SORT HEY WE WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK IN THOSE AREA BECAUSE THE VERY POOR AREAS. TO RULE MELT IN THIS AREA YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS GETTING TO SCHOOLS AND WOULD LIKE TO PUT DOWN ON THE TABLE ALSO. AND FINALLY WE JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS ACTING. IN OTHER AREAS WHENEVER YOU USE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR PRIVATE ENTITIES AND RECENTLY WON A WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLORE PARTICULARLY IN THE ONLINE. A COMMITTEE COLLEGE ISSUE WHEN YOU GET TO HIGHER EDUCATION. A IS THE INTENT TO LEAD TO PROVIDE FUNDING ON THAT WOULD GO TO A PRIVATE ENTITY AND THAT SIX SEVENTEEN SOMETHING THAT. WE SAW IN THE TRAILER BILL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WHICH OFFICE ON THE LEGISLATURE. TO EXPLORE WHAT IT THAT'S THE TO TO INTENT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE RAISED A FLAG CONSENT AT THIS STAGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AFTERNOON BRAD STRONG SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN NOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY MEMBERS. I THINK OF COUPLE THINGS FIRST TIMER. WE THINK THERE WAS A LETTER THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE INCLUDE CIVIL RIGHTS MENTAL HEALTH. AND MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS MISSION READINESS FALL SUPPORTED. SCHOOL CLIMATE AND TO ENGAGEMENT. PROPOSALS SO THIS THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CHAMPION IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF AUGMENTATION FOR PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN. THE FUNDING FOR MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AND ALSO AND WE'RE ASKING THIS YEAR ALSO FOR SCHOOL CLIMATE SERVE SURVEYS INVESTMENTS IN SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS. THINK THESE THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDRESS TRAUMA RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IF WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT. HIM THE THE YOU KNOW THE ISSUES A SCHOOL SHOOTING OR EVEN. BIHAR SUSPENSIONS AND SCHOOL CLIMATE THESE THINGS ARE ALL DIRECTLY RELATED SO IF WE THERE BUT TWENTY FIVE ORGANIZATIONS WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT. THOSE AUGMENTATIONS FROM TIME CHILDREN NOW. I HAVE A TO HAVE A LETTER THAT AND COVERED A NUMBER OF ISSUES. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. YOU HEARD EARLIER THE STATE AND THE GUARANTEE THAT IS IS NOT LIKELY TO GROW. WITH THE REVISE AND WE THINK THAT. FLUTE THAT THE THE NINETY EIGHT. SHOULD BE VIEWS AS A FLOOR NOT A CEILING AND THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE. A OVER APPROPRIATIONS. IN THE IRWIN WITH THE REVISED. ON THEM A COUPLE OF THE OTHER ISSUES. ALSO OBVIOUSLY ALL THE ONES THAT THAT WERE RAISED IN MULTI TIERED SYSTEM SUPPORT PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS. FOR THE AND THE GOVERNOR STE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WE WOULD WE WOULD URGE WE SUPPORT THAT FRAMEWORK. ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT REGIONAL SUPPORT LEADS NEED GREATER INVESTMENT THAT YOU'D WANT TO READ REGIONAL EYES. SOME SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND WE WOULD VIRGIN AUGMENTATION. AND THAT WITHIN THAT. ENGLISH NAMES ARE TO USE LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. FRAMEWORK SO. IN THE PAST DOWN THIS COMMITTEE HAD INVESTED AND THE HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE HEALTH FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION. SIMILARLY THIS YEAR WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE SAME TYPE OF IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS FOR IN THIS NAMES ARE TUNING ASSIGNS DEVELOPMENT. WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THE. ENERGY RAPID AT BRYN. I YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE YOU GOT A GREAT LETTER WILL WE'RE READING IT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LIST KEY AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES. WE APPRECIATE UMP THE BUDGET GENERALLY. THE. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. FOR FULL FUNDING LCF AMP IS QUITE WELCOME ALSO. WE KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S NOT ENOUGH IT'S NOT ADEQUATE. WE APPRECIATE THE BUDGET TRAILER BARREL. INCLUSION OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AS PART OF THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WE THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERPINNING OF THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. AND THAT OF STAKEHOLDERS PARENTS STUDENTS AND AND STAFF DO NEED TO BE ENGAGED FOR THIS TO BE REALLY A LOCAL CONTROL EFFORT. HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSED FOR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING OUT WITH THE CHAIR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT. WITH REGARD TO THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY PROPOSAL A WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE. WHERE THE? BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROPOSES TO LOCATE IT WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE CENTERED AROUND THE EL CAP SINCE THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE DIRECTED. MOST PEOPLE TO LOOK TO FOR IMPROVEMENT. A AND. WE ALSO URGE US ALL TO CONSIDER WHAT QUESTIONS ARE WE REALLY TRYING TO ANSWER. ALL AROUND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD EVENING CERRILLOS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TEACH CLASS AND OUTS ONE ECHO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT AND THE SKIN WAS MAKING ON THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY WE DO A GROUP UP REALLY APPRECIATE THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TOOK TO BEGIN TO TRY TO ADDRESS FINISH UP TRANSPARENCY WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE FOR SOME TIME. TAP A ALLOW A COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BETTER INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER TO ASK AND ANSWER MEANINGFUL QUESTIONS ARE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CROSSWALK THE PROPOSED CROSSWALK. DOESN'T GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE. SO WE WOULD URGE YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAVE MORE SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATIONS ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT TODAY WHAT% IT WAS INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS AND AND WHAT CAN THAT LOOK LIKE. SO THAT IT MEANS SOMETHING FOR STAKEHOLDERS. WE ALSO WANT TO APPROACH. OUR OUR TEACHERS ONE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS WITH THE INTENT LANGUAGE TO FOCUS ON BEGINNING TEACHER SUPPORT MENTORSHIP. WE WOULD JUST ASK WE THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO REDUCE TURNOVER TED TO IMPROVE SUPPORT RETENTION FOR EARLY CAREER TEACHERS. WE THINK IT THE. SHOULD BE I'M GOING IN NOT ONE TIME FUNDS AND SHOULD REALLY BE OUT FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THOSE EARLY CREE KERR TEACHERS HAVE THE TIME SUPPORTING EACH DEVELOPED. THINKS THAT YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS OF THE COMMITTEE RON RAPIDLY HAVE TO THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THERE'S MUCH TO LIKE IN THIS BUDGET AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CERTAINLY. AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR LCF UP TO CLOSE THE FUNDING GAP ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS. KING CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLOTS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD AND AND SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THAT YOU PUT FORTH IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. MISTER CHAIR. HOWEVER WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI BROUGHT THIS UP I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO THIS IN AS A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THIS. IS INCREASING THE BASE AMOUNT ON TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN TO TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE CLOSING THE FUNDING GAP FOR LCF OUT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SOLVING THE SCHOOL FUNDING PROBLEM. AND TO BE FORTY THIRD OR FORTY FIFTH THE FORTY SIX IN THE COUNTRY IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA AND SO ON WHAT WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO IS TAKE SERIOUSLY INCREASE IN THE BASE FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS. AND OUT THANK YOU MURATSUCHI FOR YOUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION. WE SUPPORT THE TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY. DON'T BELIEVE THAT NUMBER QUITE GETS US TO. FULLY FUNDING THE PROGRAM AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THAT AS YOU NOTE. FACILITIES IS STILL THE MOST CHRONIC NEED FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. THEY STILL DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT FACILITIES WE THINK THIS PROGRAM IS VERY IMPORTANT TO. GETTING THERE AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WERE ALWAYS OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT DON'T THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE REJECTED FOR THOSE REASONS THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES JEFF AKA REPRESENTING RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DR JUDY Y.. A JUST TWO QUICK POINTS OF THIS EVENING NUMBER ONE. STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT I GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND SECOND ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO.

HI SUSAN BONIER I'M HERE REPRESENTING MISSION READINESS WHICH IS RETIRED GENERALS AND ADMIRALS AND FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS. I'M A ME TOO ON THE LETTER THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO YOU. WE BELIEVE THAT. DISCIPLINE WITHIN SCHOOLS FOUND NEEDS A OVERHAUL STATEWIDE AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE INCREASE FUNDING FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE PROBLEMS LAND IN THE LAP OF TEACHERS AND SO WE THINK THAT PUTTING MONEY IN A GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT THERE CAN BE A SYSTEM WIDE CHANGE WHERE ADMINISTRATORS ARE ABLE TO REALLY IMPLEMENT. THE BEST POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE SOLUTIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IS WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS DON'T WANT TO EVER ENCOUNTER. THESE KIDS THEY WANT THEM TO STAY IN SCHOOL AND OUR MILITARY LEADERS BELIEVE STRONGLY. IN THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SO WE NEED FUNDING FOR THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
