MITCH HERTZBERG THANK YOU ON THE ANALYSIS POINTS TO PROP TWENTY SIX HAVE YOU DONE HAVE A LEGAL OPINION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS VIOLATES PROP TWENTY SIX WHICH IS NOT WHICH I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH MANY TIMES THAT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AS TO WHETHER. THIS CONSTITUTES TAX. SO SO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. FOR THE COUNTY WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH OUR COUNTY COUNCIL AND HAD OUTSIDE COUNSEL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PROP. TWENTY ISSUE AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WHAT WE DETERMINED WAS THAT THE HAIRS OF THE FEE THE LENDERS WITH REGARDS TO FORECLOSURE. AND THE HOMEOWNERS WITH REGARDS TO THE AIDID NOTICES THAT THEY WERE BOTH RECEIVING A DIRECT BENEFIT. FROM THESE FEES AND SO WE AGREED THAT WE HAD OVERCOME THAT WE LOOKED AT THANK YOU FOR THE OPINION OF YOUR COUNTY BUT HAVE WE LOOKED AT THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION BECAUSE I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS. HALF A DOZEN TIMES THIS YEAR AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I'VE DEALT WITH THEM ON ANY ISSUE THEY'VE TOLD ME THAT PROP. TWENTY SIX IS INVOKED IN THE COST TO TO TAX ARLEDGE COUNCILS TAKEN AN EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE VIEW. ON WHETHER SOMETHING'S ATTACKS OR NOT AT THIS THE EARTHQUAKE DEAL I'VE HAD A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF IN DISCUSSING THE WILDFIRES ALL OF THESE THINGS WE'VE CONTINUALLY GOING BACK TO LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. HAVE WE CONSULTED WITH THEM AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS IT DEALS WITH PROP TWENTY SIX THEY DID NOT RAISE A FLAG WITH OUR LEAD COUNSEL ON OUR SIDE [inaudible] NO. BUT I I JUST THINK THAT -- WE GOT TO THE HOMEWORK BECAUSE I A THIS IS GOING TO COME BACK TO BITE US. OR LITIGATED OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BECAUSE I LITERACY IS ON THE PHONE THIS WEEKEND WHERE LAWYERS WERE TELLING ME -- WE HAVE AN OPINION ON THIS ON ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING ANOTHER SUB PUBLIC POLICY AREA. AND WE THINK IT DOESN'T VIOLATE PROP TWENTY SIX AND I SAID NGUYEN HUMAN THING SO FAR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION. YOU WANT TO LITIGATE THAT BECAUSE GUESS WHAT OUR OUR APPROACH IN OUR ANALYSIS IS GOING TO BE INFORMED BY -- THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL SO I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE ASK THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL THEIR OPINION ON THIS -- GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

HEARING SEENTHEM WITH A TO BE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. LET ME TO SEE IF -- QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR MOTION YEAH -- ABOVE THE MOVE THE BILL THEY JUST COMMENTS -- OF THESE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGS GO FORWARD I'VE AGAINST IMPORTANT BUILT -- I WISH IT WERE STRONGER AND I KNOW IN PAST ITERATIONS IT WAS BUT UNFORTUNATELY DID JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- IS NOT ALWAYS FRIENDLY -- TO COMMONSENSE -- SEE QUIRK BILLS -- AND I YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE CERTAIN CERTAINTY WHEN THEY'RE ENGAGING AND DEVELOPMENT. I'M PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME -- HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT IS REALLY STRANGLING THE STATE AND WE'VE SEEN -- JUST YESTERDAY THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS NUMBERS WITH HER -- IT'S IT IS -- JUST UNBELIEVABLE HOW HOMELESSNESS IS BY DOING AROUND THE STATE IN THAT 71% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL AND DO NOT ARE NOT ADDICTED TO DRUGS UNLIKE THE STEREO TYPE THAT WE HEAR. MOST ALMOST PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE SUCH  POOR JOB ALLOWING HOUSING TO BE BUILT -- AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- SEQUEL IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LAW BUT IF YOUTO MAKE SURE THAT'S BEING APPLIED IN A RATIONAL WAY IN THE PEOPLE CAN RELY. ON THESE PLANS AND ACTUALLY BUILD HOUSING AND NOT HAVE THE RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I MOVE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WIENER WOULD LIKE TO GET A SEAT PLEASE MISTER VICE CHAIR. THE TECHNICAL QUESTION SINCE I'M NOT A LAWYER MISTER CHAIR -- IF SOMEONE. GOES TO A JUDGE AND ASKED FOR A STATE [inaudible] BUT THAT'S THEY CAN'T BE HONORED. WHAT'S THE POINT OF GOING TO THE JUDGE SO THE STATE IS NOT ON IT AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THIS IS A STAY ON THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE PLAN HAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH IN THIS CASE OF LOS ANGELES MULTIPLE YEARS OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL HEARINGS. EVERYTHING ELSE THEN THE PLAN GETS ADOPTED LEGALLY THE PLAN IS IN EFFECT. A DEVELOPER GOES AND PUTS FORWARD THEIR PROJECT MAYBE ALSO DOES YEARS OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS. THE PLAN IS APPROVED AT THAT POINT A JUDGE LET'S SAY SOMEONE'S NOW SUE THE GENERAL PLAN THE JUDGE SAYS WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN ON HOLD WILL THAT PROJECTS IS ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS UNDER A LEGALLY BINDING PLAN. WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD AT THAT POINT IF THEY ARE DEEMED COMPLETE NOT IF THEY'VE JUST SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR ENTITLEMENTS. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE EVEN IF THE PLAN -- HUSBAND STAYED BECAUSE THEY GOT CAUGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE TIMING -- IN A CERTAIN PLACE AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD -- YOU KNOW HAVE TO BEAR KIND OF THE RESULT OF THAT GIVEN THAT DURING THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS THE PLAN WAS NOT STATE. ANYTHING THAT CAME IN AFTER WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROCEED. GREAT EXPLANATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN I APPRECIATED.
