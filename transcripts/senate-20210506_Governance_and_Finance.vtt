SCHOOLS IN THE PAST I THINK

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:51.927
THAT WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.762

WAS MAKING SURE THEY CAN

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.399
ACTUALLY ACCESS THE INTERNET

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.834
AND DO THE WORK WE HAD TO.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.102
REPLACE THE LAPTOPS THAT WERE

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.370
PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL IF THEY

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.538
WEREN'T FUNCTIONAL SO WE HAD TO

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.973
GET THREE LAPTOPS. THREE DESKS.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.275

THEM ALL TO BE ABLE TO DO THE

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:13.148

TONGUE IN CHEEK BUT- IT'S

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:15.684
AMAZING HOW MUCH EXTRA FOOD

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:16.652
THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:17.719
ALL DAY AS WELL SO THERE IS AN

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:20.222
IMPACT. ON THE ON THE DIET AND

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.456

IN IN HELPING TO UNDERSTAND THE

EIGHTEEN YEARS IN BROAD REALTOR

HELPING FAMILIES ACHIEVE THE

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:35.318
AMERICAN DREAM WHICH IN MY

02:46:35.385 --> 02:46:38.154
OPINION IT IS THE BEDROCK OF

02:46:38.221 --> 02:46:39.756
HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE REASON THIS

02:46:39.823 --> 02:46:42.592
BILL HELPS. EIGHT GET FIRST

02:46:42.659 --> 02:46:44.094
TIME ENTRY LEVEL OR FIRST TIMER

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:46.229
ENTRY LEVEL HOMEOWNERS INTO

02:46:46.296 --> 02:46:49.032
HOMES. IS THAT WHEN A SELLER'S

02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:52.068
LIST HER HOME. YOU FOR THE MOST

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:52.736
PART ESPECIALLY IN OUR AREA IN

02:46:52.802 --> 02:46:54.404
THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE USUALLY

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:58.641
HAVE MULTIPLE. OFFERS AND- THE

02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:00.677
MORE OFFERS WHAT WE DO AS

02:47:00.744 --> 02:47:02.846
LEASING AGENTS IS THAT WE- SORT

02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:04.314
OF PRIORITIZED OF COURSE

02:47:04.381 --> 02:47:05.949
SELLERS ALWAYS WHEN MAXIMIZE

02:47:06.015 --> 02:47:07.217
THEIR THEIR GAMES THEY'RE

02:47:07.283 --> 02:47:08.818
LOOKING AT DATE OFFERS THAT

02:47:08.885 --> 02:47:10.820
WILL NET THEM THE MOST MONEY.

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:12.922
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS CASH BUYERS

02:47:12.989 --> 02:47:14.424
ALWAYS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE

02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:16.226
BECAUSE THEY'RE QUICK AND

02:47:16.292 --> 02:47:17.594
THEY'RE USUALLY NOT THAT THE

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:19.963

ARE HAVING TO FINANCE OUR HOME.

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:29.806
SO WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:32.008
MULTILE OFFERS IF THE SELLER

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:34.310
HAS THE OPTION TO SAY OKAY WE

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:37.247
HAVE A CASH BUYER WHICH USUALLY

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:39.549
SOMETIMES EITHER OFFER AT. I'M

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:41.418
I'M GIVING YOU THE PRACTICAL

02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:43.653
REAL LIFE SCENARIO HERE. THEY

MORE OR ASK PRICE IF THEY WANT

02:47:53.963 --> 02:47:55.732
TO COMPETE AT ALL. SO WHAT

02:47:55.799 --> 02:47:57.734
HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A CASH

02:47:57.801 --> 02:47:58.768
BUYER AND HAVE A FINANCED

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:00.703

02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:02.906
SELLERS HAVE MORE COST ON THEIR

END TO USUALLY. END WILL NET A

02:48:06.342 --> 02:48:07.310
LITTLE LESS SO WHAT THE

02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:09.279
DISPOSITION IS THAT IF WE HAD A

02:48:09.345 --> 02:48:10.947
PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS WHERE IT

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:14.617
ACTUALLY- GIVES THE ABILITY FOR

02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:17.654
SELLERS TO NET MORE MONEY. BY

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:21.124
HAVING A HIGHER EXCLUSION FROM

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:21.658
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE

02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:23.326
HUNDRED FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO

02:48:23.393 --> 02:48:23.960
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

02:48:24.027 --> 02:48:25.562
ACTION NULLIFIES SOME OF THAT

02:48:25.628 --> 02:48:27.997
COST THAT COMES FROM ACCEPTING

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:31.000
A FINANCED BUYER. SO IT

02:48:31.067 --> 02:48:32.268
ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES THEM TO

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:34.003
SAY FIRST TIME HOME BUYER I

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:35.505

HAVE A- A FINANCED BUYER. BUT

02:48:48.751 --> 02:48:49.719
YOU HAVE THIS IN PLACE. IN THEN

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:52.088
YOU HAVE A BUYER. IT USUALLY

02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:55.091
WILL WILL INCENTIVIZE THE

02:48:55.158 --> 02:48:56.326
SELLER TO CHOOSE A FIRST TIME

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:58.895

INCENTIVE TO SAY OKAY EVEN

02:49:01.464 --> 02:49:03.233
THOUGH THIS WHOLE LEVEL US OUT

02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:05.034

TIME BUYER CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:49:06.402 --> 02:49:07.337

PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED. WHO DID

04:35:45.495 --> 04:35:47.530
NOT SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL

04:35:47.597 --> 04:35:49.499
VERSION OF PROP NINETEEN FROM A

04:35:49.566 --> 04:35:52.469
COUPLE YEARS BEFORE BECAUSE IT

THEIR BASES TO ANOTHER COUNTY

04:35:58.441 --> 04:35:59.376
EVEN THOUGH THE ACCOUNT WAS

04:35:59.442 --> 04:36:02.913
IMPETUS. WHITE BALANCE THAT AL

04:36:02.979 --> 04:36:05.248
IMPROV NINETEEN WHY SOME OF US

04:36:05.315 --> 04:36:07.450
WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT- WAS

04:36:07.517 --> 04:36:10.053
BECAUSE IT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE

04:36:10.120 --> 04:36:12.088
OF SOMEONE IN HER READING.

04:36:12.155 --> 04:36:13.690
BASICALLY UP HOME FROM THEIR

04:36:13.757 --> 04:36:16.226
PARENTS AND NOT LIVING AT

04:36:16.293 --> 04:36:18.261
RENTING IT OUT USING IT AS AN

04:36:18.328 --> 04:36:20.297
INCOME PROPERTY AND STILL BEING

04:36:20.363 --> 04:36:22.933
ABLE TO HAVE THE FULL PROP

04:36:22.999 --> 04:36:23.533
THIRTEEN PROTECTION WHICH WAS

04:36:23.600 --> 04:36:25.302

A HOME. AND SO PUTTING ASIDE

04:36:30.040 --> 04:36:31.274
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THIS

04:36:31.341 --> 04:36:33.209
RAISES REAL ISSUES OF THE

04:36:33.276 --> 04:36:35.912
VOTERS VOTED ON THIS I THINK

04:36:35.979 --> 04:36:37.180
WITH A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING

04:36:37.247 --> 04:36:38.548
ANNA AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE

04:36:38.615 --> 04:36:40.250
VERY HESITANT TO CHANGE OUT

04:36:40.317 --> 04:36:41.851
WITH US SAID I KNOW THE CHAIR

04:36:41.918 --> 04:36:48.024
AND CENTER HERTZBERG SAID.

04:36:48.091 --> 04:36:48.892

COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA

04:36:57.767 --> 04:37:00.236
TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BATES

04:37:00.303 --> 04:37:02.038
FOR CLOSE TO THE ONE ITEM IS.

04:37:02.105 --> 04:37:03.506
THIS CAN BE VERY SIMILAR TO

04:37:03.573 --> 04:37:04.107
WHAT CENTER WE KNEW WAS GOING

04:37:04.174 --> 04:37:06.409
TO SAY THAT ONE- I THINK THAT

04:37:06.476 --> 04:37:08.044
THERE IS AREAS THAT WE NEED TO

04:37:08.111 --> 04:37:10.647
BE ABLE TO. LOOK AT CLEANING UP

04:37:10.714 --> 04:37:12.215
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME

04:37:12.282 --> 04:37:13.717
OTHER AREAS IT CENTER BATES

04:37:13.783 --> 04:37:14.517
WILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO

04:37:14.584 --> 04:37:17.120
EXPLORE- I THINK THE CHALLENGE

04:37:17.187 --> 04:37:18.355
WITH WHAT WAS CURRENTLY IN

04:37:18.421 --> 04:37:20.190
FRONT OF US TODAY WAS THAT THE

04:37:20.256 --> 04:37:21.825
CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TWO SETS

04:37:21.891 --> 04:37:23.126

IS A CONSTITUTIONAL. MANDATE

04:37:25.328 --> 04:37:26.429
THE OTHER IS A STATUTE PASSED

BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN THE

04:37:28.264 --> 04:37:30.300
CONFUSION THAT THAT THAT THAT

04:37:30.367 --> 04:37:31.868
WOULD BRING IN REGARDS TO

04:37:31.935 --> 04:37:33.937
ASSESSORS ABORTED EQUALIZATION

04:37:34.004 --> 04:37:35.572

04:37:35.638 --> 04:37:37.140
TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH SENATOR

04:37:37.207 --> 04:37:39.109
BATES MY EXACT WORDS THE CENTER

04:37:39.175 --> 04:37:39.809
BASED IN PLACE FOR TRACKING

THINGS WORSE- THE FIRST THING

04:51:28.037 --> 04:51:30.039

DON'T SUPPORT- THIS BILL-

04:57:38.273 --> 04:57:39.841
UNITING THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION

04:57:39.908 --> 04:57:42.611
WOULD BE- TO NOT HAVE LARGE

04:57:42.678 --> 04:57:45.948
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY- INCLUDED

04:57:46.014 --> 04:57:48.050
IN PROP THIRTEEN AT ALL I- YOU

04:57:48.116 --> 04:57:50.052

04:57:50.118 --> 04:57:52.154

THINKING CORRECT ME IF I'M IF

I'M WRONG ALTHOUGH MY

04:57:56.925 --> 04:58:00.696
UNDERSTANDING IS- WHEN PEOPLE

04:58:00.762 --> 04:58:03.765
IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR. PROP

04:58:03.832 --> 04:58:04.633
THIRTEEN WAS ABOUT PEOPLE'S

04:58:04.700 --> 04:58:07.236
HOMES- AND PEOPLE NOT LOSING

04:58:07.302 --> 04:58:08.337
THEIR HOMES ESPECIALLY PEOPLE

04:58:08.403 --> 04:58:10.806
ON FIXED INCOMES. AND THE FACT

04:58:10.872 --> 04:58:13.408
THAT LARGE YOU KNOW THESE.

04:58:13.475 --> 04:58:15.110
BUILDINGS IN DOWNTOWN SAN

04:58:15.177 --> 04:58:17.112
FRANCISCO OUR DOWNTOWN LA IS

04:58:17.179 --> 04:58:22.618
HIGH RISES- OR DISNEYLAND'S- OR

04:58:22.684 --> 04:58:26.088

04:58:26.154 --> 04:58:29.057
INCLUDED A PROP THIRTEEN IS OUR

04:58:29.124 --> 04:58:30.959
YOU KNOW HONESTLY IS ABSURD.

04:58:31.026 --> 04:58:33.895
AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN

04:58:33.962 --> 04:58:37.032
EFFECTIVELY SELL PROPERTY- AND

04:58:37.099 --> 04:58:38.100
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND NOT

04:58:38.166 --> 04:58:39.268
HAVE A REASSESSMENT OF THE

04:58:39.334 --> 04:58:41.670
EXERCISE INSULT TO INJURY

04:58:41.737 --> 04:58:42.271
BECAUSE OF COURSE PEOPLE CAN'T

04:58:42.337 --> 04:58:44.439
DO THAT WITH OUR HOME- I THINK

04:58:44.506 --> 04:58:46.541
THAT THERE. COULD BE A WAY TO

04:58:46.608 --> 04:58:48.477
CLOSE A LOOPHOLE OR

04:58:48.543 --> 04:58:49.511
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE IT

04:58:49.578 --> 04:58:52.381
LEGISLATIVELY- I DON'T THINK

04:58:52.447 --> 04:58:54.316
THAT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY DOES

04:58:54.383 --> 04:58:55.884
THAT EFFECTIVELY HAS TWO MAIN

04:58:55.951 --> 04:58:58.220
EXCLUSIONS THE 90% THRESHOLD IS

04:58:58.287 --> 04:59:00.489
TOO HIGH. AND IT DOES THIS IF

04:59:00.555 --> 04:59:01.323
WE WERE TO PASS THIS

04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:03.725
LEGISLATION IT COULD CREATE AN

04:59:03.792 --> 04:59:05.661
ACCURATE PERCEPTION THAT WOULD

04:59:05.727 --> 04:59:08.263
SOMEHOW SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND

04:59:08.330 --> 04:59:10.399
THEN TAKE MOMENTUM AWAY FROM

04:59:10.465 --> 04:59:12.100
EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS

04:59:12.167 --> 04:59:14.036
PROBLEM. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE

04:59:14.102 --> 04:59:15.470
WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO

04:59:15.537 --> 04:59:19.508
I DON'T THINK IT CUTS US THERE-

04:59:19.574 --> 04:59:20.075
AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

04:59:20.142 --> 04:59:21.610
THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR

OF A LEGAL ENTITY CHANGED. IT

05:00:12.894 --> 05:00:13.362
