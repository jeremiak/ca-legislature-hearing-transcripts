00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.110
AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOGO

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:28.980
AS IT'S BEING. DOWNSIZED

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:30.548
SLIGHTLY WHICH- DOESN'T MAKE

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.383
MUCH OF AN ISSUE I THINK THE

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.618
RECOGNITION OF WHAT IT IS IN

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.486
THE ABILITY FOR THE INDUSTRY TO

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:36.654
MARKET THAT AND HANDLE IT MORE

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.623
EFFECTIVE WAY IS GREAT. BUT

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.757
THERE IS A LITTLE SPACE

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:40.558
UNDERNEATH THERE THAT'S GOING

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.693
TO BE AVAILABLE FOR

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:43.361
UTILIZATION. IS THERE GOING TO

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.596
BE A WAY TO MAYBE HELP CLARIFY

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:46.698
SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW THE

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:47.899
DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:51.069
IS. THC OR WHETHER IT DOESN'T

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.837
HAVE TO SEE SO THAT CAN BE

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.305
MARKED ON THEIR IN A CLEAR WAY

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:57.942
SO THE USER WILL NOT CONFUSE

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:01.579
BY. BY NOT KNOWING. SOMEONE I

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.480
REALLY APPRECIATE QUESTION IT'S

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:03.548
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.116
THAT WE INTRODUCED THE BILL

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.117

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.386
BIT OF SPACE. BELOW HOWEVER

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.754
WHAT WHAT THE COMPANIES ARE

FOR PROVIDE THE RATIO BECAUSE

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.434
IF YOU TRY TO PUT IT BELOW IT'S

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.436
VERY VERY SMALL AND IT WILL BE

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:26.804
HARD TO SEE BUT TYPICALLY FOR
