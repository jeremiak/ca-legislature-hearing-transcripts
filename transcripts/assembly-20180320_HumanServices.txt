GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO THE MARCH TWENTIETH HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE TODAY WE HAVE THIRTEEN BILLS AND ONE RESOLUTION UP. SEVEN OF WHICH ARE ON CONSENT AS A REMINDER WE ALLOW TWO MINUTE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FOR EACH BILL. EACH OF THESE WITNESSES SHOULD LIMIT THEIR TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES ANY ADDITIONAL WHEN THIS IS ME AT ON THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BY STATING ONLY THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT DOCTOR CHOI IS HERE SO IF WE MAY ARE GOING TO GET STARTED THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEN WHEN WE. HAVE CRIME WILL GO AHEAD AND STOP AND I ESTABLISH QUORUM. THANK YOU DOCTOR TREE. OKAY. LET'S SEE. MOST. YEAH MISTER HOLDEN IF YOU MAY. SINCE YOU'RE HERE PATIENTLY WAITING FOR US PLEASE COME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND TO JOIN WITH YOU AND. YOUR COMMITTEE OF ONE FOR NOW. THERE IS ZERO. BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY. I LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OF FOR AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ADOPT REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THE CHILDCARE CENTERS DRINKING WATER IS LEAD FREE. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS ALL LICENSE CHILD HERE. GILES DAYCARE FACILITIES TO BORROW NO INTEREST LOANS TO PAY FOR LEAD CLEANUP AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. DRINKING WATER AND MOST CHILDCARE CENTERS IS NOT TESTED FOR LEAD. THIS IS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY WATER PIPES FAUCETS AND FIXTURES. STILL ARE IN USE. CONTAINED LEAD IN OVERTIME THIS LEAD CAN LEACH INTO THE DRINKING WATER. YET WE KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE MOST HARMED BY LEAD BECAUSE THEY ABSORB MUCH. OF THE LEAD DAY IN JUST. ACCORDING TO AMERICAN ACADEMY FOR PEDIATRICS AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD. CHILLED IN CHILDREN. LEAD SEVERE NEUROTOXIN EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD IN THE BODIES OF YOUNG VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. CAUSE HARM TO THEIR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THIS HARM APPEARS TO BE HEARD IRREVERSIBLE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY WILL HELP KEEP YOUNG OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAFE BY ENSURING THAT THEY ARE NOT INGESTING LEAD THROUGH THE WATER THEY DRINK. I HAVE WITH ME CRISTINA HATE. SENIOR POLICY ADVISER HAD UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. AND SUSAN LITTLE FROM THE VARMINT WORKING GROUP I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOV. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MY NAME AS CRISTINA HECHT AND I'M SENIOR POLICY ADVISER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE WHICH IS AND THEN DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE ENGAGES IN RESEARCH TO SUPPORT POLICY AND I FOCUS ON DRINKING WATER AND WORK WITH RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA NUTRITION LEGISLATION PROVIDE GREAT ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER FOR CHILDREN IN LICENSED CHILDCARE. BUT OUR CONCERN IS THAT THEY IGNORE THE SAFETY PIECE. LEAD IS MOST TOXIC TO CHILDREN UNDER AGE SIX AND EVEN MORE TO CHILDREN UNDER AGE THREE. THIS IS BECAUSE CHILDREN ABSORB BLOOD MORE READILY. AND ALSO THERE GROWING BRAINS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE. YOUNG CHILDREN CAN'T ABSORB UP TO FIT FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE LEAD THAT THEY IN CHEST. FORMULA FED INFANTS ARE EVEN GREATER RISK. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CONSUME THE MOST WATER PER BODY WEIGHT. SIXTY PERCENT OF BABIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY FORMULA FED AND THEY DRINK UP TO FOUR CUPS OF WATER PER DAY IN THEIR RECONSTITUTED FORMULA. FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF INFANTS EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS THROUGH WATER USED TO MIX FORMULA. THERE'S ANOTHER REASON TO CARE ABOUT TAP WATER SAFETY. DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF SUGARY DRINKS IS A GREAT WAY TO REDUCE INTAKE OF THE EMPTY CALORIES IN ADDED SUGAR SUTTER SUCH A CONTRIBUTOR. TO DIET RELATED CHRONIC DISEASE INCLUDING DIABETES TYPE TWO ONE DENTAL CAVITIES. WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THEIR TAP WATER SAFETY SO THAT THEY CAN DRINK. WATER INSTEAD OF SUGARY TRACKS. WE TOUCHED WATER BEFORE IT LEAVES THE UTILITY BUT THERE'S ALMOST NO TESTING OF WATER AT THE TAP. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE A FRONT RUNNER IN ASSURING SAFE DRINKING WATER IN LICENSED CHILDCARE CENTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO TALK. TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU ABOUT THIS BILL. MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND AS MENTIONED LOW LET LOW EVEN LOW LEVELS OF LEAD EXPOSURE CAN REDUCE A CHILD'S IQ AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND. UNFORTUNATELY WE NOW KNOW THAT THOSE. THAT DAMAGE CAN LAST FOR A CHILD'S LIFE TIME AND REDUCE THEIR LIFE THEIR LIFE OUTCOMES. IN FACT ONE IN FRONT THAT AMERICA CAT ME PEDIATRICS STATES THAT ONE IN FIVE CASES OF CHILDHOOD. ADHD IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LEAD EXPOSURE. AND SADLY CHILDREN WERE MALNOURISHED ABSORBED LED MUCH FASTER. AND WE DO KNOW THAT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF LEAD POISONED KIDS IN CALIFORNIA COME FROM LEAD FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. UNFORTUNATE MOST OF THESE KIDS ARE NOT TESTED FOR LEAD EXPOSURE SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A. GOOD HANDLE ON THE EXTENT OF THE LEAD EXPOSURE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO NO THAT LEAD EXPOSURE IS PREVENTABLE AND WE CAN BECAUSE WE CAN REMOVE LEAD. SUCH AS LEAD THAT'S IN WATER. AND RECENTLY. CHILDCARE FACILITIES AT SCHOOL SITES HAVE BEEN HAVING TO TEST THEIR WATER. AND SOME OF THE SITES OF SOME OF THEM ARE OKAY SOME OF THE SITES TO HAVE ELEVATED PRETTY HELD ELEVATED LEVELS. AND AFFECT WONDERING ONE CHILD CARE CENTER IN OAKLAND. HAD SEVEN THERE ITS WATER HAD SEVENTEEN TIMES THE ALLOWABLE LIMIT OF LEAD IN THAT DRINKING WATER. IT'S A AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY REQUIRES DSS TO IT AND FORCED TO ENSURE THAT SENT THE CENTERS DRINKING WATER IS LEAD FREE. AND BASICALLY JUST WHEN FORCED THEIR EXISTING LICENSING STANDARDS SO THANK YOU WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. IT'S ONE. OKAY. ACTUALLY CAN WE ESTABLISH CORN PLEASE. RUBIO. START CHOI. ARAMBULA. MAIENSCHEIN. RESTS. STONE. BERMAN. THANK YOU ARM IF THERE ARE ANY OUT WITNESSES ARE ALLAH ANY. SUPPORT. PLEASE COME UP THE ONLY SUPPORT COMES UP HERE. THANK YOU KEVIN AS THEN COLUSA CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT POISONING THE PORTION THE IMPACT. LOW INCOME KIDS MR KELBERG'S KIDS THAT IN I ORIGINAL I PUT THANK YOU. TRUTH ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARCANE UCP CALIFORNIA COOPERATION AND SUPPORT. RICK ROLLINS ON BEHALF OF ARCA SITUATION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. JIM WYNBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO. CHIME IN SUPPORT FOR THE CLEAN WATER ACTION PARENTS. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. K. HEARING NONE ALL BUT BRING IT UP TO THE THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK. THANK YOU I HAVE A A MOTIONS I CONDUCTED CHOI. NOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY. AND THE LIEU LET LEVEL. KA I'M STRUGGLING. EVEN THOUGHT THE ISSUE THE SAME POLL RUN. HOWEVER A WE ARE KNOW THAT. TOO MANY REGULATIONS SAW ARE ARE PREVENTING. QUAN NECESSARY. A CHILD CARE FACILITIES SO. BEING OPENED. AND. AND THIS IS A AND OF THOUGH LAYER OF FOG REQUIREMENTS. AND THE EVEN THOUGH WE ORDERED REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT. THAT YOU JUST HAVE ISSUES ARE. BUT THE. CHILD CARE INSTITUTIONS SO. OF. MAY BE. THERE MAY BE SOME SOME OLD ONES ABOUT THE NEW ONES SO. LIKELY WOULD HAVE FOR NEW PIE BUT. AND A VERY. YEAH LEADERS CHAD SAID THAT THAT THAT LEVEL WOULD BE HIGHER THAN. AND AT THAT THAT REQUIRED THE WHOEVER. THE WHOLE ROOM SAID THEY COME FROM. ARE ARE LIKELY. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE OR THE PIPES AND THAT HAVE FOR. MORE LEAD LEVELS. WHY DO WE HAVE TO FOCUS UPON ONLY CHILD CARE CENTERS? CHILDREN COME FROM HOMES WHAT ABOUT THE OR THE HOMES WENDELL BOTTOM. BUT WAY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK. FOR SMALL ARE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IDEALLY THAT. WHERE? NOT ONLY ARE CHILDREN ARBOR WHERE WHATEVER. WHEREVER WE ARE AND WE'RE ACCESS SEEN ALL WATER THAT. WE HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF ASSURANCE THAT IF THERE'S. AUG MINIMAL OF NO LEAD IN THE WATER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE K. THROUGH TWELVE. THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE. TESTING. THERE ARE NONE CURRENTLY AS IT RELATES TO CHILDCARE CENTERS. THERE ARE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO WERE IN CHILDCARE CENTERS. EVERYDAY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS. CURRENT CONDITIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE IS LED. THAT WE IN THE WATER THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT AND THEN WE CAN START A PROCESS OF REMEDIATION. AND SO IT'S A APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP. WHEN YOU MENTION OVER REGULATION I THINK THAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS BILL THERE IS. NO REGULATION CURRENTLY TO ADDRESS LET TESTING FOR. CHILDCARE CENTERS AT IN TERMS OF NEW FACILITIES. NO THAT'S GREAT IF THEY'RE BEING BUILT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY WOULD BE. BILL TO CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT. YOU WOULD ASSUME WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE. OUR PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. LET US CAP OF THE WATER BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT COULD EVEN BE LEACHED AND. OUT SOMEHOW WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND THOSE WHO ARE. SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AREA PEOPLE. UNDERSTAND WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN ARE AT AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S OF POTENTIAL FOR A LEAD TO LEACH INTO THE WATER SYSTEM THEREBY CREATING. THESE KIND OF HARMFUL SAFETY CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT ON A CHILD'S ABILITY TO. LEARN AND ALSO. KEEP HIM SAFE AND SO WE THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE STEP WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS A. FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF OVER REGULATED IT'S IS REGULATING. SOMETHING THAT CURRENTLY IS NOT. AT THE PROPER OVERSIGHT. AND GREATER A HIGHER STANDARD OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE. YEAH. M.. I'M STRUGGLING OUT OF BETWEEN THE. THE RETURN REGULATIONS SO VERSUS A. AND CHILDREN'S A SAFETY AND A CHILDREN'S SAFETY IS A FORMER SO YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR CHILDREN ABOUT A LOT MORE I THINK YOU DECIDE HOW WE CAN COMPROMISE SO. HOW OFTEN THE WATER HAS TO BE TESTED THE FOR EXAMPLE? IF NOT BE EVERY MONTH I EVERY SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR WITH TWO YEARS OF THREE YEARS. IF AND WHEN THAT THE WATER LEVEL. DID LEAD LEVEL IS SO HIGH IT AN ARE. OF THE QUIET THOSE STANDARDS ARE THEN. A WILL THERE BE ANY SUBSTITUTE ON THE KEBAB INTO WATER O.. O. WALK TEND WATER WHATEVER CAN BE PROVIDED TO INSTEAD OF A TABLET WE HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE TAP WATER YOU RIGHT. YES. IF I IF I MA'AM SUSAN LITTLE AGAIN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP SO. I'D NATIONWIDE THERE'S MEANT ABOUT SIX OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED. DRINKING WATER TESTING STANDARDS ON CHILDCARE CENTERS AND FACILITIES. AND THOSE STANDARDS TYPICALLY REQUIRED RETESTING ABOUT EVERY SIX YEARS. EVERY CITY EVERY SIX YEARS AND THIS IS A BILL TO ME. I'M SORRY  <u><c.green>I FEAR OBVIOUS</c></u> YURI'S ABOUT IT THAT HAS TO BE A EVERY YEAR AND SIX YEARS HIS SON IN ROME POP CAN HAVE A RUSHED TO WALK ON THAT LEVEL. YOU KNOW WHY NOT EVERY YEAR HERE AND THEN. I'LL LET. I THINK THAT THE WATER. SUPPLY WETA TAP WATER OF WHATEVER THAT WATER IS TIPPING PEOPLE BEING. PROVIDED TO CHILDREN CAN BE TESTED THAT IF THAT THE LEVEL IS ABOVE FLOOD AND SUBSTITUTE A RATHER THAN. RATHER THAN. DE CHILD CARE CENTER PERMIT THIS OUT FOR. WOULD BE DEPENDING UPON THE TAP WATER. SO I INTO A BIG POTAWATOMI AGAIN IN I THINK INTRIGUED OUT OF WHAT WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MUCH CHEAPER AND A. LOT EASIER OF FOR TALK CARE CENTERS TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE AND ON NEWLY OPENED. NUMBER ONE THING THAT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY ARM. DEFERS TO THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE WATER BOARD TO DEVELOP. DECIDE HOW IT'S GOING TO BE THAT THAT CHILDHOOD LEAD TESTING REQUIREMENT WILL BE CARRIED OUT. BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE SPECIFIC CONCERNS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS AS TO HOW IT'LL HAPPEN. AND WE FELT THAT IT WAS BEST TO. TO LEAVE THAT DECISION MAKING UP TO THE AGENCIES. WHO KNOW BEST REALLY HOW TO DO? THE MOST EFFICIENT WATER TESTING AND THIS AND THIS WAY IN THIS WAY FOR THESE FACILITIES ONE THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT CHILDCARE CENTERS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S OWN COMMERCIAL. THERE IS NO TAP WATER TESTING OF THOSE CENTERS ON THERE IS SPORADIC TESTING OF HOMES THEIR STUDENT LEAD AND COPPER RULE. ENFORCEMENT BUT. THEY'RE BASICALLY OFF THE GRID IN TERMS OF WATER TESTING FROM INSIDE THE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW SO THAT IS WHY. WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY URGENT MATTER TO BRING FORWARD. SO WHAT'S GOING ON NINE TO TALK THIS OUT LEFT LEVEL OF A CHILD CARE LICENSING HOSPITALS ARE SERVICES THAT WOULD PULL OUT OUR EVERY EVERY. ONCE IN EVERY SIX YEARS WE HAVE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS ONE AT LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL ROUND OF TESTING BUT. IT LEAVES OPEN. IT LEAVES OUT OPEN TO THE AGENCY'S DECIDE HOW TO BEST PROCEED. NOW IS THERE ANY DESIRE THAT NO AFFECT AND. A MAN DEL REQUIREMENT THE WHAT ABOUT DRINKING WATER SUPPLY RATHER THAN TAP WATER JUST A FIXED TERRA. WOULD A FIXTURE. A SHALL MEET THAT REQUIREMENT THAT. I MEAN. DID THE WATER PIPE BY OPERATION IF THE BIDDING HAPPENS TO BE OLD ONE THAT CAN BE A LOT COSTA DEBT THAN. IN A BIG WATER BOTTLE THAT EVERYBODY CAN DRINK OUT ABOUT WHAT WAS SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO CENTER WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE A FILTER BECAUSE FILTERS CAN. FILTER OUT LEAD FAIRLY EASILY. AND AGAIN THAT'S PART. THE THE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE TO BE PROVIDED SAFE IMPOSSIBLE AND LEAD FREE WATER. AND SO IF THERE HAS TO BE STOP GAP MEASURES AVAILABLE TO THE CHILDCARE FACILITIES CHILD CARE CENTERS. THEN THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE AGENCIES COULD. COULD INCLUDE IN THE REGULATION. YEAH AVAILABLE OPTION THAT HALL AVAILABLE LOOK A LOWER COST AVAILABLE OPTION IF THERE'S A PLUMBING PROBLEM MORE EXPENSIVE PROBLEM THEN THAT WOULD BE A STOP GAP. OPTION. THERE IS ALSO ON THIS AVAILABLE FUND THAT WE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE FACILITIES TO USED UP TO. ARM. TO EMPLOYEE TO. UPGRADE THEIR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS OF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED IF THAT'S IF THAT IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE AND THE AS THEY WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE. SURE KNOW THE. THERE IS EXIT THERE'S AN EXISTING POT OF MONEY THAT HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZED IT'S FOR CHILDCARE FACILITIES TO USE TO UPGRADE. THEIR FACILITIES AND THIS WOULD SPECIFIC SPECIFIED THAT THE CENTERS CAN USE THAT NO INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM. TO PAY FOR THEIR UPGRADES. IT WOULD BE ALONE IT'S A LOAN. ONLY MY CONCERN IS THAT. BECAUSE OF THEIR WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE UP ATTACK GET CENTER SO. AWESOME AND AND AND AND I DON'T BURDEN BECAUSE HER REGULATIONS HAVE% WATER ORDERS JUST SO IN AWE CREATE HUMBLE PROBLEMS. OUR OBJECT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD LIKE TO. THANK YOU ON THIS AYE. MEASURE OF PIETY A CO AUTHORED A BILL LAST YEAR FOR LEAD TESTING IN SCHOOLS ARE BECAUSE WE SAW A PROBLEM IN SAN DIEGO AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS ARM FORWARD. AND JUST KIND OF TO PIGGYBACK ON THAT I DID SPENT YEARS ON A WATER DISTRICT AND UPON REQUEST IF ANY AGENCY OR ANY HOUSEHOLD FOR THAT MATTER I REQUEST A TESTING THEY THEY COULD COME UP AND DO IT FOR FREE. SO WE CAN ADD THAT TO TO THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS AS WELL SO I THINK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. COULD I ADD ONE MORE THING. IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE FLINT HAS HAPPENED WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW LED GETS INTO WATER AND THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF. WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THROUGH THESE TESTING PROGRAMS. BUT WE ARE ALSO STARTING TO LEARN SO MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. AND SO CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE BENEFICIARY OF LEARNING FROM OTHER STATES AS THE. ALL WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD AND DSS WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THESE REGULATIONS. THANK YOU I HAVE A MOTION BY. MISTER STONE AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA. YES I AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I THINK THAT WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED. OF THE EXTENT OF THE BILL AND WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO AND.

PRIORITIES WITH CHILDCARE SLOTS AND THE TALKED A LOT TO THE ADVOCATES. WHAT IF THAT TO DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHERS AND WE FEEL THAT IT IS BEST TO JUST REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE SO WE DON'T INTERFERE? WITH THE ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIORITIES. AND HOW WE END UP WITH PRIORITIES READ CHILD CARE SLOTS IS IS A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION THIS WAS NOT INTENDED TO WAIT IN IN THAT FIGHT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE KIND OF RESETS TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LANGUAGE THAT'S WHY ITS URGENCY WE'VE MOVE THIS THROUGH QUICKLY THROUGH THE.

AB NINETEEN FORTY WOULD FULFILL A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE STATE AUDITOR TO THE LEGISLATOR. BY ADDING SIX SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CRIMES. TO THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES CAREGIVER BACKGROUND CHECK BUREAUS NON EXEMPT LIST. THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATIVE EXPANDS A LIST OF PRIVATE CRIMES TO INCLUDE SIX SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CRIMES TO THOSE. ALREADY ON THE NON EXEMPT THOSE SIX CRIMES INCLUDING THREE OUNCES OF RAPE PIMPING PANDERING. AND IDENTITY THEFT DSS OPERATES OVER SEVEN THOUSAND COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING CHILD CARE FACILITIES FOSTER. FAMILY HOMES DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY FACILITIES AN ELDERLY FISTS FACILITIES. PROTECT OUR CLIENTS THE STATE REQUIRES ALL APPLICANTS TO OBTAIN A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR THE CARE GIVERS BACKGROUND CHECK BUREAU. THE STATE OUT OF OTHER DISCOVERED THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND. THIRTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE DSS RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED BACKGROUND CHECKS MENTION ONE OF THE SIX CRIMES MENTIONED AND AB NINETEEN FOURTEEN. DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME THIS C. B. C. B.. ALLOWED FORTY OF THOSE SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS TO WORK IN A LICENSE CARE FACILITY IN OTHER WORDS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FORTY INDIVIDUALS PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF EITHER RATE PIMPING PANDERING OR IDENTITY THEFT WERE ALLOWED TO WORK. WITH SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AB NINETEEN FOURTEEN WOULD ALLOW. WOULD ADD SIX SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CRIMES TO THE NON EXEMPT LIST ENSURING THAT WE PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE TO VIGILS. IN OUR SOCIETY HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IS BOB HARRIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MY NAME IS BOB PARIS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE PRINCIPAL AUDITOR ON AN AUDIT WE CONDUCTED OF THE CARE GIVER BACKGROUND CHECKS BUREAU WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. ON AS A MATTER OF POLICY OUR OFFICE DOESN'T TAKE A POSITION EITHER AGAINST OR FOR LEGISLATION BUT I CAN TESTIFY THAT THIS BILL AS DRAFTED IN WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WOULD IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATION WE MADE. IN THAT AUDIT REPORT SPECIFICALLY TO EXPAND THE LIST OF NON EXAMPLE CRIMES CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW. AND BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AS A THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID MENTIONED. STATEWIDE GENERALLY PROHIBITS ANYONE WITH A CRIMINAL CONVICTION FROM BEING PRESENT TO CARE FOR LIVE WITH CLIENTS UNLICENSED CARE FACILITIES BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE ABILITY TO ISSUE EXEMPTIONS TO THAT PROHIBITION. EXCEPT FOR A AND NUMERATOR NUMBER OF CRIMES WHICH WERE CONSIDERED NON EXEMPT APPLE ANOTHER IT'S THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T ISSUE PERMISSION TO BE IN THE FACILITY. DURING THE AUDIT WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL CRIMES INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THAT WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO CRIMES ON THAT NON EXEMPT HERBALIST BUT THE DEPARTMENT WAS CURRENTLY IN IS STILL CURRENTLY ALLOWED ISSUE EXEMPTIONS FOR THOSE CRIMES DOES INCLUDE. OFFENSES FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND IDENTITY THEFT. IN PARTICULAR WE FOUND ONE EXAMPLE WHERE EH INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS CONVICTED CONVICTED OF IDENTITY THEFT WAS LATER CERTIFIED TO BE AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY. NOW AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS CONVICTED OF ELDER ABUSE BECAUSE THEY STEAL THE IDENTITY OF AN ELDER A INDIVIDUAL. WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES BUT BECAUSE THIS GENERAL CRIME OF IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED ON THE LIST THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT IN SUCH A FACILITY. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. OKAY AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RICKROLLING TRIPS IN THE ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTERS AGENCIES AND SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. INTEREST ANDERSON WITH ARKIN UCP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AFTERNOON AND CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIZZIE BEACON WITH THE ACLU CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE SPELL. OF THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO HAVE A LIFETIME PROHIBITION AGAINST BEING PRESIDENT ONE OF THESE FACILITIES EVEN IF THEY POSE NO RISK TO THE HEALTH OR SAFETY? I'M MORE WELL BEING OF THE OF THE CLIENTS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS THAT THESE ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THAT'S WHY AS WE'VE HEARD. DSS IS REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ANY YOU ON ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO BE PRESENT WHEN THESEFACILITIES. ANYONE WITH A CONVICTION AYE IS PROHIBITED FROM BEING AT THESE FACILITIES UNLESS THEY GET THE EXEMPTION FROM THE CBC BE. THE CBC. THE CAREGIVERS BACKGROUND CHECK BUREAU. REVIEWS THE FULL CONVICTION HISTORY OF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEY CONSIDER STATEMENTS OF CHARACTER AND THEY CONSIDER THE VULNERABILITY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE PRIOR OFFENSES. AYE THEY THEY CONSIDER THE FULL POLICE REPORTS OF ALL OF THE INCIDENTS THE INDIVIDUALS STATEMENTS OF OF ALL OF THE OFFENSES THERE'S A THOROUGH PROCESS FOR. FOR INDIVIDUALLY VETTING THESE PEOPLE ON WITH CREEK WITHOUT A CONVICTION HISTORIES AND IT IS ONLY IF THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. THAT THEY ARE OF GOOD CHARACTER AND THAT THEY ARE NOT A THREAT TO THE SAFETY OR WELL BEING OF THE CLIENTS THAT THEY CAN BE GRANTED AN EXEMPTION. SO THERE IS A PROCESS AND IN PLACE FOR CAREFULLY EVALUATING THESE INDIVIDUALS AYE THIS BILL WOULD COMPLETELY LOCKED OUT. AND AB A LOCK OUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THIS. FROM THIS ENTIRE PROCESS BY ENACTING THIS LIFETIME PROHIBITION AGAINST ANYONE WHO HAS EVER HAD ANY OF THESE CONVICTIONS I'M FROM EVER BEING PRESIDENT ONE OF THESE FACILITIES. EVEN IF THEY ARE OF NO THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THESE CLIENTS AT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY WOULD IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE CLIENTS. AND. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CONVICTIONS WHO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED ADD TO BE PRESENT AT THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANYTHING THAT RESULTED IN HARM TO ANYONE WHO'S AT THESE FACILITIES. SITTING AROUND BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH CONVICTION HAS STORIES AND MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND EMPLOYMENT FOR THEM TO. AND FIND STABLE HOUSING FOR THEM TO FIND VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES EVEN AND SO FOR FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M HEARING A NEW GOAL MADE ME CLOSE PLEASE APOLOGIZE Y. THINK THAT THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL AND WE OBSCENE EXCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE WRITTEN. SPEC LAST RIVAL. I THINK I NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. I'LL GO AND MOVE.

AND DEVISES VIOS BILL LANGUAGE AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING TO WORKING WITH US TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE FOSTER YOU HAVE A CONSISTENT AND STRONG HOME FOUNDATION. AND ARE NOT UNNECESSARILY MOVED OF FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER ACCORDING TO THE. CHILD WELFARE INDICATOR PROJECT THE NATION'S AVERAGE IS FOUR POINT EIGHTEEN PLACEMENT CHANGES PER ONE THOUSAND DAYS. IN CARE OF A FOR FOSTER YOUTH WE HARM OUR CHILDREN AND DISRUPT THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING BY MOVING THEM AMONGST HOME TO HOME TO HOME. THESE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS ARM AND RISK A DESTABILIZE DESTABILIZING ON THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. THEY HAVE BUILT UP IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.% THIS BILL THIS IS THE REASON WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN WILL CREATE A PROCESS FOR PLACEMENT. STRANGERS AND REQUIRE SOCIAL WORKERS AND PLACEMENT AGENCIES TO CREATE A PLAN WITH FACILITATE MEDIATE AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION PRACTICES. SO THAT IF A PARENT HAS A CONCERN RATHER THAN MERELY REQUESTING THE CHILD BE REMOVED. IT. QUIRK CHOIRS A CONVERSATION TO TAKE PLACE IN AND TOO QUICK TO HELP RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES OF THEIR THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES A FIFTEEN DAY NOTICE BEFORE A CHILD CAN BE REMOVED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A YOUTH HEALTH AND WELL BEING IS IN JEOPARDY. WITH THEIR CURRENT PLACEMENT THE FIFTEEN DAY NOTICE IS WAIVED AND THE PLACEMENT TRAINS FOLLOWS THE CURRENT STANDARD SO IT CAN. BE THE TALK OF REMOVED. IMMEDIATELY IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THAT CHILD. WE HAVE TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER THAT WANTS TO STAY TOGETHER AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T KICK OUT OUR OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILD BECAUSE OF A MINOR. DISRUPTION AND THAT MAY TAKE PLACE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN IS A SAFE AND THOUGHTFUL A BILL DEVELOPED BY FOSTER YOUTH THAT SUPPORT FOSTER YOUTH. WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH? HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES MISS VANESSA I'M HERNANDEZ OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WHY POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA YOU CONNECTION. AND. CAN KATERINA CAT AGREEMENT CATERINA A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. WE JUST STEP IN AND MAKE A TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME SO THAT'S A HERNANDEZ I'M WITH C. WAY SEE WE ARE A YOU PLED ORGANIZATION AND THAT MEANS THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE COME TOGETHER ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE. THE BIGGEST GAPS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I'M BASED ON THEIR OWN ANALYSIS THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND. MOST DEPRESSED IMPRESSIVELY SLIP THE SO THEY IDENTIFIED THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE. THIS YEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL PLATFORM. MEMBERS REALLY CHALLENGE THEMSELVES TO GET AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF SOME OF THESE MOST NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE ALL WE ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH. THIS YEAR. OUR MEMBERS ARE LOOKING TO RAISE THE FLAG AND THE IMPORTANCE OF STABILITY STABILITY EMPLACEMENTS STABILITY IN RELATIONSHIPS A STABILITY IN SERVICES AND STABILITY IN THE WILDNESS. CURRENTLY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM EMPLOYS A TOOL CALLED THE SEVEN DAY NOTICES THIS IS NOT IN REGULATIONS AND SAW ENCODE AND IT THE SENTENCE I GOT SEVEN DADE IS SOME A FULL SENTENCE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. CAN COMPREHEND AND USE IN SHORTHAND SEVEN DAY NOTICE IS THE FORMAL PROCESS IN WHICH A COUNTY FOSTER PARENT OR SOCIAL WORKERS. USES TO INITIATE A POLICEMAN CHANGE IMAGINE UPROOTING YOUR WHOLE LIFE. IN LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS. AB TWO TWO FOUR SEVEN WILL DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS IT WILL A DEFYING ABRUPTLY SPIN CHANGES THIS BILL WILL ALSO. OUTLINED THOUGH CORRECT PROCESS THAT IF A POLICEMAN CHANGE HAS TO OCCUR AND WE UNDERSTAND SOME CASES THAT DOES. THE FOLLOWING PROCESS IT SHOULD HAPPEN AND ALSO OUTLINE. PARAMETERS OF IT IF AND WHEN HOW A PLACEMENT CHANGE SHOULD NEVER OCCUR I  <u><c.green>IN THE MIDDLE OF</c></u> THE NIGHT I'M DURING A SCHOOL DAY OR WHERE IT RESULTS AND. SIBLING SETS BEING PULLED APART. I AM I WILL NOW PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUE CUTTING. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CUTTING I CAME BACK I AM TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD FROM OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND I AM THE MSW STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. I AM SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN THIS BILL SEEKS TO CREATE A YOUTH CENTERED PROCESS FOR STABILITY WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. I FIRST ENTERED FOSTER CARE WHEN I WAS JUST SIX MONTHS OLD AN EMANCIPATED AT EIGHTEEN. DURING THIS TIME I EXPERIENCED THIRTY TWO PLACEMENT CHANGES. I WAS PULLED FROM HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND OUT OF SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN I WAS CALLED TO THE OFFICE AND MY SOCIAL WORKER IS THERE SHE'D ALREADY PACKED A TRASH BAG WITH THE THINGS THAT SHE THOUGHT WERE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME TO BRING AND TOLD ME THAT I WAS. MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND AT MOVING TO SACRAMENTO FROM OAKLAND AND. UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP TOUCH WITH MY SIBLINGS. I WAS IN SECOND GRADE. THE THING ABOUT PACKING AND TRASH BAGS OF THAT TRASH BAGS ARE TOO FRAGILE TO CARRY FUTURES. THIS BILL. IS THE THIRTY STRUCTURE THAT WE DESERVE TO PROTECT OUR FUTURES. AB TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN MATTERS BECAUSE STABILITY BE GET SUCCESS. I LIKE USING PLANTS AS A METAPHOR. BECAUSE YOU CAN BE PLANTED PLANT AND I CAN BE TRANSPLANTED EGGMAN GROW BEAUTIFULLY BUT THERE'S A PROCESS. IN ORDER FOR IT TO FLOURISH IF YOU DON'T WATER IT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE THAT IF YOU DON'T ALLOW TIME TO ROUTE. THEN IT WILL NEVER GROW. I JUST ASK THAT. WITH SUPPORTING THIS BILL THAT YOU GIVE. FOSTER YOUTH THAT PROCESS. BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE OKAY WITH THEIR KIDS BEING AND BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID ADDS. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY FOSTER YOUTH TO GO THROUGH WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH I STILL DON'T UNPACK MY BELONGINGS IN THAT SENSE OF INSTABILITY STILL STICKS WITH ME YEARS LATER NO MATTER HOW MUCH. I ACHIEVE OR TRY. INSTEAD OF SEVEN DAY NOTICE SAYS INSTEAD OF TRASH BAGS WE NEED THIS BELL. STRUCTURE FOR STABILITY IS IN YOUR HANDS AND I REALLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN TO CREATE A YOUTH CENTERED PROCESS FOR STABILITY WITHIN THE FOSTER. CARE SYSTEM FOR THE FUTURE. OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND AS SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KELLY BROOKS I'M REPRESENTING THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TODAY AND WE HAVE A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT POSITION WE WANT I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. IN ENGAGING WITH US SO EARLY ON THE SPELL AND WE AGREE THAT PRESERVING PLACEMENTS WHERE EVER POSSIBLE IS MUCH PREFERRED OVER MAKING PLACEMENT CHANGES AND THAT AN ORDERLY WAY. OF MAKING PLACEMENT CHANGES IS WHAT WE WANT TO IS THAT YOU WANNA UP. MOVE HAS TO OCCUR.

THANK YOU MR ACOSTA GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE TIME THIS AFTERNOON. DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CURRENTLY SERVES OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THROUGH ITS COMMITTEE SERVICES PROGRAM. SERVICES ARE COORDINATED THROUGH TWENTY ONE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT AGENCIES CALLED REGIONAL CENTERS WHICH ACCESS ELIGIBILITY ELIGIBILITY AND DEVELOP INDIVIDUAL. PROGRAM PLANS FOR CONSUMERS. REGIONAL CENTERS* A CONTRACT WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VENDORS AROUND THE STATE TO PURCHASE SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR CONSUMERS. DEPARTMENT PROVIDES THE REGIONAL CENTERS WITH THE BUDGET FOR BOTH THIRD MINISTRY OF OPERATIONS AND THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES PREVENT FROM VENDORS. FOR RATES PREVIOUSLY NEGOTIATED BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND VENDORS BUDGET SOLUTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE RECENT RECESSION FROZE RATES AND ESTABLISH THE MEDIAN RATE PROCESS FOR NEW VENDORS. THERE IS A RATE CAP WAIVER PROCESS FOR SITUATIONS WHEN A LACK OF VENDOR AVAILABILITY WITHIN THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THE CONSUMER. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT PROCESS IS OVERWHELMED RESULTING IN EVER INCREASING WAIT TIMES FOR WAIVER DETERMINATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE CURRENT PROCESS BEING BOGGED DOWN IS THAT REQUESTED BAR INVOLVE LARGER SYSTEMIC ISSUE ISSUES. LIKE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES WHICH ARE ROUTED THROUGH THE EXISTING HEALTH AND SERVICE WAIVER PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRACKING THE STATUS OF THE WAIVER REQUESTS AFTER IS SUBMITTED. TO DTS. AB TWENTY TO FORTY FOUR WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY ONE CLARIFYING THAT EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY WEBER PROCESSES. IT'S FOR INDIVIDUAL ISSUES. UP BUILDING ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THESE INDIVIDUAL WAIVERS ARE ACTED UPON AND REASONABLE TIME FRAMES. AND THREE DIRECTING DTS TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR HANDLING LARGER SYSTEMIC ISSUES. ALL PARTIES INVOLVED INCLUDING DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THE REGIONAL CENTER PROVIDERS AND CONSUMER GROUPS ALL OF KNOWLEDGE. SEVERITY OF THIS ISSUE AND RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY. I HAVE WITH ME IN SUPPORT EVELYN ABOUT WHO SOUGHT. ABOLHASSAN FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND SHE'S GONNA BE SPEAK LOUDLY FROM THE AUDIENCE MY YEAH DOT CORRECT. AND. RECURRENCE FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND BURIED YOUR ARE GIARDINI FROM. THIS VILLAGE SERVICES SOCIAIS XIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS EVELYN I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO LAST NAME. EVELYN APPLE HASN'T DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WERE ACROSS DISABILITY ORGANIZATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS PER INDIVIDUALS ENTERING CRISIS. OF THE CURTAIN THE CRIME PROCESS DOESN'T WORK WAITING LONG TIMES TO COME GO THROUGH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WEBER PROCESS. OF ESSENTIALLY PEOPLE AND UP INSTITUTIONALIZED WHICH IS WHAT WE DON'T WANT SO THAT WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT CREATES TIMELINES. AN EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN CRISIS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO TO MOVE THIS FORWARD SO WITH THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL WE. LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS AND. SEE YOURSELF AS A RESOURCE BOTH TO THE AUTHOR IN AND THE COMMITTEES THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE COLLINS WITH SUSPICION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR A CARING THIS BILL ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS A IN DTS IS A GOOD PROCESS. FOR WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR AND THAT IS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. TAKE GOOD CARE FOR FOLKS WHO NEED THE HEALTH SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS OVER TIME IT'S BEEN THE ONLY PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN ABLE TO USE TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC ISSUES LIKE. THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE A ISSUE. AND ARE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH REQUESTS FROM REGIONAL CENTERS THROUGH THEIR PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ANOTHER UNFUNDED MANDATE PROGRAMS. SO WE SUPPORT THIS. THIS EFFORT TO LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ITH THE AUTHOR TO REFINE IT AND. WE AND AND LARGE PARTIES VARIOUS. TIED TOGETHER WITH A AN EFFORT BY MR HOLDEN THAT WAS. PROPER FOR A CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA SUBCOMMITTEE ON TRYING TO HARM BRIDGE THE GAP ON FUNDING FOR OF ON ON. UNMET TO NEED. HAD UNFUNDED UNFUNDED MANDATES A FOR OUR OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR BURIED CUTTING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION I'LL KEEP THIS QUITE BRIEF. BUT OF FUNDAMENTALLY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WEBER PROCESS AT THE MOMENT JUST DOESN'T WORK. THE CURRENT WAIT TIME IF YOU INCLUDE PENDING REQUESTS AS OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DAYS. THAT'S NOT REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR INDIVIDUALS WEARING CRISIS WHO WHOM AND PROVIDERS WHO NEED RATES TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL STAFFING FOR. A MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL NEEDS I'M TO WAIT IN ORDER TO GET SOME SORT OF RATE RELIEF TO PROVIDE THOSE NECESSARY SERVICES. ARE SO WE WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORT A SPELLING WE HOPE FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I'M SORRY IN SUPPORT. AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO. I SAW THE PANIC BUTTON. THANK YOU TERESA ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARE CAN YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATES IN MARIN STRONG SUPPORT WITHIN APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THEY AUTHORED THE OFFICE. THANK YOU. OKAY NOW ANY MEMBER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUE OUT BRING IT UP TO THE% COMMITTEE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. POPE I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AT THE VERY BOTTOM THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT. HOW THIS BILL WILL INTERACT WITH THE CURRENT RATE STUDY THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING THROUGH? AND WANTED TO GET A COMMENT FROM YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE ON. THAT RATE STUDY. WELL THE BILL ACTUALLY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE RATE STUDY IF THE RATE STUDY COMES OUT AND THERE'S A NEED AND THERE'S AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ACTION ON THE ON IT INCREASED RATES. IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE IT THAT MUCH SIMPLER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE THEY THE RATES ARE GOING TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH. AND AB AND BE THE FACT THAT THEY'LL HAVE SOME SYSTEMS IN PLACE BY THE TIME THAT RATE STUDY IS COMPLETED WERE. GETTING AHEAD OF A SERIOUS ISSUE RIGHT NOW THAT IS REALLY IMPACTING THE YET DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THAT THE CONSUMERS ARE NOT AFFECTED ADVERSELY. AND THEN IF WE WAIT FOR THE RATE STUDY WHICH IS GONNA TELL US WHAT'S ALREADY PRETTY EVIDENT IN THE IF IN THE ISSUE BUT A WHAT THERE'S NO IN A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO AS A MATTER FACT DIFFERENTLY COMPLEMENTARY. SO I GUESS SOME. I'M QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A BANDAID TO ALLOW US. THIRD DO TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RATE STUDY COMES BACK AND I'M. TRYING TO WONDER IF THIS OBSCURES THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN COLLECTING AND IS THERE. ANYTHING WITHIN THIS BILL THAT. WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO GET AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND LEVEL I I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS IN A TIMELY FASHION. I'M JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE WE GATHER APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. WELLED UP LET'S LET ME START BY SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW DETRIMENTAL TO THAT PROCESS. AND AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ANY YOU KNOW CONSTITUENCY GROUPS ARE THE OF COURSE MISTER HOLDEN. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT YOU KNOW THAT WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT GOING FORWARD WE CAN BE PROTECTING A COMMUNITY. OTHER FRANKLY. IN MY HUMBLE OPINION IS UNDERSERVED AS IT IS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T FALL INTO FURTHER DEFICIT BUT DOGMA CERTAINLY DON'T TO THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE. THE OF LIKE YOU SAID THE USER WORKS GEAR THAT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY YET THAT THE DATA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE COLLECTING. WITH THAT ASSURANCE THAT I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUE I DO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. THAT DOT THE ONE CONCERN THAT I DID HAVE IS. WE HAVE. WE CAN EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL PROCESS BY DDS I'M COMING REQUEST MULTIPLE EXTENSION SO HOW WILL BE. THAT BE. AVOIDED OR IKE IF I'M DDS I CAN EXTENDED YOU KNOW JUST HAVE SOME VIA. SITTING THERE TRYING TO EXTEND. THE THE WAIVER SO. HOW? CAN WE WORK AROUND THAT. YOU WANT. WE'RE. WELL I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE THERE COULD BE A AN AMENDMENT TO THE CAP THE NUMBER OF. YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DDS TO MAKE ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAY REQUESTS I I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BUT THIS POINT THE OTHERS INTERESTED IN TAKING SUCH AN AMENDMENT BUT THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO ENSURE. I MEAN THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THERE IS AN UNDEFINED AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE NUMBER I REFERENCED EARLIER DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TIME REGIONAL CENTERS ARE PROCESS IN THEIR QUEST THAT'S JUST THE TIME. FROM WHICH DTS FOR RECEIVES THE REQUEST AND TRIES TO MAKE A DECISION ON IT SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT FIRST STEP IN AT LEAST PUTTING SOME SORT OF TIME FRAME ON WHEN WE WOULD EXPECT A DECISION TO BE MADE BY DTS. AND M. MADAM CHAIR ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS BILL REALLY. DRESSES TWO ISSUES ONE WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. TRUE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS AT THIS. PER OF THIS PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED TO. DO TAKES CARE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS APPROVED QUICKLY AND RIGHT NOW IT'S HAPPINESS AT BEING SO BOGGED DOWN IMPROVE A IN DEALING WITH SYSTEM THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES LIKE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO THAT'S A REAL PRIORITY OF THIS EFFORT AND AS WELL TO COME UP WITH THE ALTERNATIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES LIKE ARM LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE AND HAS DR ARAMBULA MENTIONED. THIS BRIDGE FUNDING FOR MISTER HOLDEN US REQUEST TO THE BUDGET SUB ONE WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP WITH THAT UNTIL THE RACE THAT HE DOES COME OUT. AND LEGISLATURE ACTS TO FULLY FUND THE RATE STUDY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY HIVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OF WHICH LIKE CLOSE. BOB. JUST. WITHOUT ALL JUST ASK FOR YOUR UP HERE I VOTE I THINK THAT WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. THANK YOU. CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RUBIO ARE REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI HIGH DOCTOR CHOI AYE SEPTEMBER LEFT. MAIENSCHEIN. THERE'S. VARIOUS AYE STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. THE VILLAGE UP FOR THIS YEAR. CAN'T WE HAVE A FOUR ZERO A VOTE TO DO PET. WHERE IT'S THERE A MOTION WAS TO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS THANK WELCOME AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR? MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WOULD MODERNIZE STATE LAWS GOVERNING COMMUNICATION FOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. MORE THAN FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS OVER HALF OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN RELY ON CALPERS BENEFITS FOR FOOD. OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM CAL WORKS NUMBER THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON THAT ACCOUNT FOR HEALTH CARE THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER AND POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER STATE LAWS GOVERNING COMMUNICATION FOR THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. NEW METHODS SUCH AS COMPUTER GENERATED TEXTING AND OTHER ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES OFFER ACCESSIBLE EFFICIENT AND COMMONPLACE OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT COMMUNICATION BARRIERS. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ALSO PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW ON LAW AND POVERTY HAS FOUND THAT MANY CLIENTS RECEIVING PUBLIC BENEFITS. FEEL LESS SECURE WITH THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BEING SENT. TRADITIONAL MALE. THIS IS BECAUSE MANY FAMILIES ON PUBLIC BENEFITS MAY MOVE FREQUENTLY OR LIVE IN SHARED HOUSING. AND GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION CAN PRESENT A MORE PRIVATE AND SECURE OPTION. SECURE OPTION. THE PERIOD NOT A COMA. COUNTIES ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO INCREASE ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS FORMS AND NOTICES ELECTRONICALLY BUT NEED CERTAINTY FROM THE STATE. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN GENERATE INCREDIBLE RESULTS. SENATE CLARA COUNTY HAS IMPLEMENTED CONFERENCE OF TEXT VOICE MAIL AND EMAIL TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY'VE REDUCED TURN TO UNDER ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO TWELVE PERCENT STATEWIDE AND THEY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WAIT TIMES. BUT WITHOUT GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE COUNTIES MAY BEDISCOURAGED FROM IMPLEMENTING NEW TECHNOLOGY. THEREFORE AB NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD AUTHORIZE AND SET PARAMETERS FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE RIGHT OF APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AND ENDED WHEN THEY NO LONGER WANT TO RECEIVE IT. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT NOTICES BE SENT VIA SECURED SERVER AND WOOD ENSURE THE COMMUNICATION COMPLIES WITH STATE SECURITY STANDARDS. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS MODERNIZATION AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT TECHNOLOGIES ONLY HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO IT. THIS BILL CONSIDERS THAT REALITY BY PRESERVING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION VIA TRADITIONAL MALE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL BRING OUR LAWS GOVERNING COMMUNICATION FOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. OF CALIFORNIANS WHOIS WHO RELY ON THESE PROGRAMS FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY OF APPLICANTS RECIPIENTS AND COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY EMPLOYEES AND IN SHORT CLARITY. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. AND THE COALITION OF OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. HELLO I'M SENDING MACALLAN THE OF VICE PRESIDENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT POLICY BUT THE SECOND HARVEST FOOD BANK OF SANTA CLARENCE MATEO COUNTIES. HAD BEEN AFFILIATED WITH THE FOOD BANK IN OF WORK BUT SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I CURRENTLY CO CHAIR OF THE SENATE CLARA COUNTY SAFETY NET COMMITTEE WITH SOCIAL SERVICES. DURING MY TIME AT THE FOOD BANK I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THE BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE FACE WHEN SEEKING BENEFITS. CONSUMERS MUST COMPLETE THE NUMBER OF STEPS IN ORDER TO SECURE AND MAINTAIN BENEFITS SOME OF THE STEPS RELY ON OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PRACTICES SUCH AS REQUIRING HARD COPIES OF DOCUMENTS LIKE PAYCHECK STUBS. FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES THEY HAVE LIMITED TIME THEIR JUGGLING YOUR REGULAR WORK SHIFTS. TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES AND HAVE THE RECALL HAVING THE REQUIRED PAPERWORK CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL. HAVING TO PHYSICALLY GO TO A SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE FOR ROUTINE APPOINTMENTS CAN BE A CHALLENGE. SUDDEN GAPS AND ACCESS TO FOOD CREATES HUNGER HARDSHIP AND INSTABILITY IN THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. THE PROBLEM FAMILIES LOSING BENEFITS WHILE STILL BEING ELIGIBLE THEN QUICKLY REAPPLYING IS CALLED TURN. RE APPLICATIONS FOR BENEFITS GENERATES REDUNDANT PAPERWORK FOR FAMILY SEEKING ASSISTANCE AND THE FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES ASSISTED BY THEM. WHEN FAMILIES LOSE BENEFITS MORE PRESSURE IS PUT ON ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS OUR FOOD BANK. AND OUR FOOD ASSISTANCE NETWORK AND WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING STRETCHED TO CAPACITY. HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP US IN MANY MANY WAYS SECOND HARVEST FOOD BANKS WORKS WAS TO COUNTY SANTA CLARA AND SAN MATEO COUNTIES? THAT ADMINISTER PUBLIC BENEFITS SUCH AS CAL FRESH. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY I HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS OF THIS FORWARD THINKING. THEY HAVE M. PLUMMETED A NUMBER OF ROBUST ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS THAT STREAMLINED PROCESSES. REDUCE CHURN BOOSTED CLIENT SERVICES TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN USED FOR TASKS SUCH AS SENDING OUT REMINDER TEXTS FOR SUBMITTING REPORTING FORMS. AND REQUIRED VERIFICATIONS IN ORDER DIRECT EVER RE CERTIFIED THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO CONTINUE RECEIVING BENEFITS. REQUIRED VERIFICATIONS CAN BE PROVIDED BY TAKING A PICTURE USING A SMARTPHONE RATHER THAN COMING INTO A SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE OFFICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN DISCOVER FLOW WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I KNOW WE ARE HERE AS A SPONSOR AND SUPPORT HIS ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL IS IS DOING TWO THINGS. UP FIRST IT'S CREATING THE SPACE FOR COUNTIES TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD AND DEVELOP THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO SERVE THE CLIENTS AND THE COMMUNITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM THE BEST. ON THE OTHER SIDE TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLIENTS RIGHTS AND RESPONSIVE AT THE RIGHT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WELL COMMUNICATED TO THEM AND THAT THEY'RE DUE PROCESS IS PROTECTED. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT IT'S A SPACE WHERE THERE'S. OR SO WORKING UP THE LANGUAGE AND AND HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT AND HOW IT HAD CODIFY IT AND SO I JUST A QUICK THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. OF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE LANGUAGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AND YOU KNOW AND UP TO THIS POINT IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU TURNER THROUGH CHORUS A CALIFORNIA OFFER RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CLOSE MONTHS IN THE BILL AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OTHER CHAIR MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO MAKE CAP BENEFITS MORE ACCESSIBLE. TO INDIVIDUALS WITH. DISABILITIES AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT INDEED THE TECHNOLOGY THAT USED IN THIS CASE IS ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI THERE SARAH PALMER TO FRANK CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS ALSO A CO SPONSOR. AND WE'RE JUST VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL NOT ONLY INCREASING ACCESS. TO THE BENEFIT. ALSO HELPING COUNTIES JUST. WAY THE FOUNDATION TO PERHAPS REDUCE CHURN INCREASE OF INCREASED EFFICIENCY THANK YOU THANK YOU. KELLY WORKS ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT POSITION WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DEVELOP SOME STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR COUNTIES TO FOLLOW WHEN DEVELOPING APPS AND OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLIENTS. UNTIL NOW COUNTIES HAVE LARGELY DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TECH COMPANIES ARE NON PROFITS. WE THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF PROTECTING PRIVACY IN PRESERVING TRACE BUT THEY'RE LIKELY SOME DIFFERENCES A COST COUNTIES AND THE DIFFERENT. APPS SYSTEM THAT THEY'D ABOUT DEVELOPED AND IT SENSIBLE TO PUT SOME STATEWIDE STANDARDS IN PLACE WE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSOR AND COMMITTEE STOP ON SOME INITIAL AMENDMENTS THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE. BUT WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO GETTING THERE AND WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH MOVING THE BILL FOR TODAY. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GET OUT GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. GET IBM MOTION BY DUCT CHOICE SECOND BY A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE TO SIT VERY QUICKLY AS YOU KNOW MANY OF US FOR THE LOCAL FOOD BANK OVER LUNCH VOLUNTEERING. AND WE WERE TAX TALKING ABOUT REDUCING BARRIERS TO TO FOOD BANKS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK YOUR HELP WITH THE WITH THE BILL AND. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RUBIO I REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. DUCKS CHOI AYE ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I MAIENSCHEIN. THERE'S. THERE'S AYE STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. BILLS PIPES HERE GAVE THE UP THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE AND IT MOVES OUT FIVE ZERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SEVEN WAS INTRODUCED TO HELP PREVENT HUNGER IN OUR STATE. FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE WITH FOOD INSECURITIES EVERYDAY. THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM KNOWN AS CAL FRESH IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER. WELL MANY RELY ON THIS BENEFIT IT AMOUNTS TO LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS PER MEAL. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THIS AMOUNT IS LESS THAN WHAT IS NEEDED TO PURCHASE A HEALTHY DIET. BECAUSE BENEFITS ARE SO LOW NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVE SNAP BENEFITS STILL MUST RELY ON FOOD BANKS TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS FOR FOOD. THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE INCREASED MONTHLY. CAL FRESH BENEFITS. BOOSTING THEIR PURCHASING POWER SO THAT THEY MAY AVERT HUNGER AND ALSO HELPED STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. THIS INCREASE IN MONTHLY FOOD BENEFIT LASTED ONLY UNTIL OCTOBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. HOWEVER THE INCREASE IN BENEFIT WAS DOCUMENTED TO HAVE REDUCED INCIDENCE OF HUNGER AND INCREASING A PURCHASING OF HEALTHY FOOD. SINCE THE ARE A BOOST OF SNAP BENEFITS WAS TERMINATED THE AVERAGE FAMILY OF THREE HAS HAD THEIR BENEFITS REDUCED BY TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SEVEN PROVIDES A TWENTY EIGHT DOLLAR INCREASED TO CAL FRESH MONTHLY BENEFITS. THE POOREST FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN OFTEN FACE THE MOST SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGES. SPECIALLY WHEN THEY LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER OR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER FOOD COSTS. INCREASING THE MONTHLY BENEFIT IN THE PROGRAM WILL HELP PREVENT HUNGER. SUPPORT HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASES STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS. ADDITIONALLY STATE LAW ALLOWS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE FOR RECIPIENTS ON CAL WORKS WHEN THE RECIPIENT HAS A DIET RELATED DISEASE THAT REQUIRES A SPECIAL DIET. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SEVEN MAKES A CHANGE TO THE CAL WORKS SPECIAL FOOD BENEFIT. SO THAT IT IS DELIVERED ON AB T. AS A FOOD BENEFIT RATHER THAN A CAST BENEFIT WHERE IT WOULD BE COUNT. COUNTABLE INCOME IN CAL FRESH. IT ALSO ADDS LACK OF FRESH WATER AND HIGH LEAD BLOOD LEVELS AS REASONS TO RECEIVE THE COW WORK SPECIAL FOODS. NEEDS SUPPLEMENT. AND IT CODIFIES THE CURRENT GUIDANCE OF THE AMOUNT OF SPECIAL NEEDS SUPPLEMENT AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE ANDREW SHANE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND STEVE SUMMERS A CAL FRESH RECIPIENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT MY NAME IS STEPHEN SOMMERS I LIVE IN OAKLAND I'M SIX A TWO YEARS OLD AND I. THE MACAU FRESH RECIPIENT ON AND OFF CENTS. THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. OVER THAT TIME A BEING ON CAL FRESH AND WHEN I WAS HOMELESS. CAL FRESH HELPED ME TO. MAKE GOOD CHOICES FOR HEALTHY MEALS. WHEN I WAS UNEMPLOYED AFTER AND AFTER BECOMING HOMELESS AFTER WORKING MY WAY OUT IN GETTING A JOB IT WENT OFF. CAL FRESH  <u><c.green>I LOST THAT JOB.</c></u> THAT THEM MYSELF BACK ON CAL FRESH DURING THAT TIME. USING CAL FRESH HELP WE HAVE TO. BUT IT MADE ME OF VOID USING THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE THE CHOICE BETWEEN. RENT AND FOOD. SO IT LITERALLY HELP ME I STAY IN MY SHELTER. NOW DAYS I'M STILL ON CAL FRESH I WORK TWENTY HOURS A WEEK FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND. I GET A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DOLLARS A MONTH. AND. I JUST WANT TO SAY. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND RESTORING THE TWENTY EIGHT DOLLAR. CUT. I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE THAT. EVEN WITH THE CAL FRESH BENEFITS I GET IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER MY MONTHLY FOOD BUDGET. IT'S A CONSTANT PUZZLE TO PUT TOGETHER. HOW I'M GOING TO COVER IT? I. USE MY CAL FRESH BENEFITS. I ALSO GO TO A FOOD DISTRIBUTION ONCE A WEEK. TO MAKE UP FOR THE SLACK. AND I SPEND MY OWN. MY OWN MONEY FROM MY JOB TO COVER MY. FOOD UP COST. SO IT'S A CONSTANT PUZZLE TO PUT THAT TOGETHER EVERY MONTH. AND. YOU KNOW FOR ME. I'M BETTER OFF THAN MOST CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS BECAUSE I LIVE NEAR. A FULL SERVICE GROCERY STORE I HAD THE ABILITY TO COOK MEALS I HAD THE ABILITY TO TAKE. ADVANTAGE OF SALES I KID MEAL PLAN AND MANY PEOPLE ON CAL FRESH OR UNABLE TO DO THESE THINGS SO. THAT GAP IS GETTING HARDER TO CLOSE AND EVEN FOR ME WHO'S SOME. YOU KNOW RELATIVELY. I WANT TO SAY WELL OFF ON CAL FRESHMAN HAVE MANY OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT A LOT OF. CALVET BIAN'S DON'T GET SO I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A INTERCHANGE IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. I CAN'T PUT IT BETTER THAN THAT I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE DOCTOR ROMULUS POINT THAT THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY. STEVE STORIES IS FAR FROM THE EXCEPTION. YOU KNOW IT'S IN FACT NEARLY A THIRD OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE ON CONFERENCE RONSTADT ARE STILL COMING TO FOOD BANKS BECAUSE OF BENEFIT ADEQUACY. AND THAT INADEQUACY IS A CHOICE HAS BEEN MADE BY CONGRESS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY ASKING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER REVERSING WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE HUNGER CLIFF IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND RESTORE THOSE BENEFITS THAT WERE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO FIGHT HUNGER. TO SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY AND TO SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING I THINK GOALS THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT AND CYPRESS YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THAT AND I WOULD JUST MAKE TWO. TWO POINTS. WHICH IS THAT THIS IF WE DON'T DO THIS THIS COMES WITH CERTAIN COSTS TO OUR STATE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT FOLKS ARE COMING TO FOOD BANKS OR THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT RUNNING OUT OF FOOD JUST ONE TIME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY MONTH. AND THAT MEANS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THERE'S UNMET NEED BECAUSE OF STEVE POINTED OUT NO ONE CAN NOT NEVER CAN GET TO A FOOD BANK I THINK IS OFTEN THAT MYTH THAT COULD MAKE HER JUST JUST THERE WITH FOOD EVERY DAY pSEVEN NO WE. THE SERVICES ARE ARE LIMITED IN THERE'S DISTANCES AND AND AND REAL COSTS AND TIME INVESTMENTS THERE. AND MEANWHILE HOSPITALIZATION SPIKE IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF THE MONTH WHEN FOOD BUDGETS RUN OUT BOOKS CAN TAKE THEIR MEDS AND THE REST OF THE STORY THAT WE KNOW. AND I AND ADDITIONALLY THE FOOD BANKS IN THEY'RE BUILT FOR THIS WE'RE BUILT FOR OCCASIONAL TEMPORARY SUPPORT AND THAT'S SIMPLY AND INCREASINGLY LESS THAN WAS THE CASE AS HOUSING PRESSURES AND OTHERS THAT HE SPOKE TO. YOU KNOW CONTINUE MEANWHILE CONFERENCE IN THAT MEETING THE NEED IT THAT IS MEANT TO DO SO. FEDERATION THANK YOU. SACRAMENTO ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTH OVER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE'RE SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AND THANK YOU MISTER SUMMERS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.
