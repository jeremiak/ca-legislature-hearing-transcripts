AS CALIFORNIA MAKES TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THERE IS A NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORM AS WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THE FRAGMENTATION THE INEFFICIENCIES AND INEQUITIES THAT A PLAGUE THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR FAR TOO LONG THAT THESE CHANGES WILL RAISE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ADVANCE POPULATION HEALTH BY PROMOTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF HEALTH PLAN THAT USES INTEGRATED MODEL OF CARE. THIS NEW PLAN IS CALLED AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLAN OR E. H. C. S. P. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. WILL HAVE THESE H. C. S. P.'S WHICH MUST OPERATE AS A HEALTH PLAN A PROVIDER NETWORK AND MUST OWN OR OPERATE THEIR OWN PHARMACIES. TO COMPARE H. C. S. P.'S TO OTHER HEALTH CARE PLANS IS LIKE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES AS OTHER HEALTHCARE PLANS DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN PROVIDER NETWORKS OR PHARMACIES. AT THIS TIME HEISER PERMANENT TODAY IS THE ONLY SUCH PLAN THAT MEETS ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT CURRENT PLANS FOR MOVING TOWARDS A MODEL BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO ITS MEMBERS. THE STATE WOULD ENTER A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH AN H. C. S. P. JUST LIKE IT CURRENTLY DOES WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER MEDIC CAL HEALTH PLANS H. THE CSP'S MUST MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AS OTHER HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO TIME WITH ACCESS. GRAFT ACCESS QUALITY METRICS COORDINATION OF CARE SAFETY NET COVERAGE NON DISCRIMINATION AND THE EXACT THE EXECUTION OF A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH COUNTIES AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH H. C. S. P.'S THE STATE WILL HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THESE PLANS AS THEY STEP UP TO PROVIDE MORE CARE FOR MEDICAID ALL IN WILL EASE. JUST AS IMPORTANT CONSUMERS WILL HAVE A DIRECT LINK TO H. C. S. P. SERVICES WITHOUT THE NEED TO DIVERT FUNDS INTENDED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES TOWARDS ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. WHICH HAPPENS QUITE A BIT UNDER CURRENT SUBCONTRACTING PRACTICES CAN SUBCONTRACT WITH KP AND ARE TAKING BETWEEN TWO AND 20% OF THE MEDICARE FEE FOR THEMSELVES AS ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. THE OPPOSITION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT DOES THE STATE OR CONSUMER GET OUT OF THEM KEEPING THE ADMIN FEE. THE DIRECT CONTACT WILL IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ENSURING THAT FUNDS THAT ARE MEANT TO COVER MEDICAL SERVICES DO JUST THAT. YOU'LL HEAR THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT THIS IS A SWEETHEART NO BID CONTRACT BILL KOS AND L. I. PLANS ARE ALSO NO BID CONTRACTS. YOU'LL HEAR THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT THIS BILL INTERFERES WITH LOCAL CONTROL YET KNOW WHERE IN THIS BILL WILL YOU FIND LANGUAGE THAT INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF THE CODE OR L. I. PLANS TO SUB CONTRACT FOR SERVICES UNDER CURRENT LAW. OR TO INTERFERE IN THEIR EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO MANDATE HOW CODES OR LRE PLAN PROVIDE THEIR SERVICE. YOU'LL HEAR THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT THIS BILL WILL JEOPARDIZE HEALTH CARE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE AND YET THEY DON'T EXPLAIN THAT THE H. C. S. P. WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SAFETY NET STANDARDS. THAT THE CODES AND ALLIED PLANS CURRENTLY MUST ENSURE. WHAT THE OPPOSITION WON'T SAY IS THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES H. C. S. P.'S TO GO THROUGH A MUCH MORE RIGOROUS CONTRACTING PROCESS. THEN DH CS CURRENTLY DOES IN ENTERING CONTRACTS WITH OUR LOCAL PLANTS. THE OPPOSITION WON'T SAY THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ALSO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR ADVANCES EQUITY INCREASES ACCESS IMPROVES AFFORDABILITY IMPROVES THE QUALITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY FROM OUR H. C. S. B. TESTIFYING HERE TODAY ARE JOSE TAURUS WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR BOSS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND A ROOF SHAKE WITH KAISER PERMANENTE. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD WILL HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES TOTAL FOR YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY RIGHT THANK IS A MEMBER ARAMBULA GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THOUGH THEYTOWARDS WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. HEALTH ACCESS HAS A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INTENSIVE ENTER INTO A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER PERMANENTE AS A MEDIC CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE. HEALTH ACCESS IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE VARIOUS GOALS IN THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE PATIENTS AROUND THE STATE. WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE IF THEY HAD PRIOR COVERAGE WITH KAISER AND NOW BECOME ELIGIBLE FROM. IF THIS WORKS AS INTENDED MORE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS AND MORE COUNTIES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR KAISER DOCTOR AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE THEIR CARE INTERRUPTED. WE ALSO SUPPORT EXPANDING THE OPTION OF KAISER COVERAGE TO THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. OF FOSTER CHILDREN AND TWO OTHERS WERE SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. GETTING KAISER TO DO MORE OF ITS FAIR SHARE IN MEDIC COW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CAPACITY. QUALITY AND A CABIN ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY I'M SORRY IN THIS KEEP PROGRAM THAT SERVES OVER THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. HEISER DOES RELATIVELY WELL ON MANY QUALITY METRICS BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. ON THEIR RECORD FOR QUALITY IN EQUITY ESPECIALLY WITHIN BEHAVIOR HEALTH. A DIRECT CONTRACT WITHIN A DIRECT CONTRIBUTING DH CS AND KAISER WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THE STATE TO HAVE. GREATER AND MORE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OVER KAISER. WHILE WE SUPPORT THE BROAD INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENDED GOALS AND COMMITMENTS ARE CODIFIED. THE-BEST BENEFIT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY WITH IN THIS CONTRACT WITH KAISER AT THE MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS. SOME OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AND WE THINK THE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR. IN WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS THEM. THESE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED THAT THERE BE NO DENY ALL OVER ROAMING. FOR THOSE PROTECTED BY THE CONTINUAL CARE THAT KAISER. AND THAT KAISER IS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS OTHER HEALTH PLANS. THAT THEY'RE BEING A DEFINITION OF CONTINUITY OF CARE AND CLARIFICATION OF FAMILY LINKAGE. AND THAT THE LANGUAGE OF JUST. UNDERSTAND ROAMING MATCH WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE. HOWEVER WE STILL DO HAVE VARIOUS. OUTSTANDING CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD. WE WANT TO CODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE KAISER. THE POOR FQHCS IN THEIR SERVICE AREA TO IMPLEMENT A PORTFOLIO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. AND CLINICAL TRANSFORMATION. WE ALSO SEEK TO CODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE EITHER PROVIDE SPECIALTY SERVICES FOR THE HIGHEST NEED SPECIALTIES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ARE USING KAISER PHYSICIANS. A LIMITED NUMBER OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND RELATED NEEDS SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND OUTPATIENT PROCEDURES. BURKE NON KAISER MEMBERS. BOTH OF THESE SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO WHAT ALREADY EXISTS NOT IN PLACE OF WHAT SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE DOING TODAY THOSE BEING THE COMMUNITY CLINICS AND COUNTY HOSPITAL. WE ALSO SEEK BACK HIGHS ARE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES ON SERVING THE MEDICARE POPULATION. WHILE WE CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORT THE DIRECT ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE STATE WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE LOCAL VOICE OVER MAD COW. WE ESPECIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THESE GOALS OF CAL AIMS FOR WHOLE PERSON CARE WOULD BE BEST MET IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AS SUCH WE SEEK TO CODIFY LANGUAGE HAVE KAISER ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COUNTY IS THAT THEY ARE LOCATED IN TO BEST COURTNEY. THE NECESSARY CARE FOR BENEFICIARIES. AND IT IS NOT JUST CALLING HIM. HI THERE NEED TO CONNECT WITH COUNTIES TO HELP ADDRESS NEEDS LIKE HOUSING INSTABILITY. FOOD AND FOOD AND SECURITY AND ON BEING A PRODUCTIVE PARTNER IN THE LOCAL SAID HEALTH SYSTEM. AGAIN OUT ACCESS CALIFORNIA IS TAKING A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS DIRECT CONTRACTING PROPOSAL WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THAT PROCESS. WE DO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US. WELL SOME OF OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. OTHER OUTSTANDING CONCERNS AS MENTIONED AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO ADDRESS THEM BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROPOSED THE BEST BENEFITS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THIS BOX. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR EFFECTUATE OUR BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSAL DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH KAISER AS A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES HEISER IS DIFFERENT FROM OUR OTHER MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS IS THE AUTHOR NOTED IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS BOTH THE PLANT AND ANIMAL WRITER REALLY RELIED ON ITS BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE CARE. HI THERE DOES NOT EXPAND ITS ACCESS FIGHT CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDER GROUPS ARE PHYSICIAN GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE OTHER MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. THEY'RE INTEGRATED AND SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM IS UNIQUE AND THEY'VE BEEN TREATED UNIQUELY- BY THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THIS HI THERE IS NOT BEEN- SUBJECT TO THE TRADITIONAL MEDIKAL PLAN CHOICE METHODS WITH ANYONE WHO CHOOSES KAISER COULD ENROLL IN KAISER. ENROLLMENT GROWTH RATE WOULD FAR OUT PASSED THE PHYSICAL CAPACITY. HI THERE IS ALSO UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S SYSTEM INCLUDES ACCESS TO THE SAME PROVIDERS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL MEDICARE EXCHANGE AND MEDICAL POPULATIONS. AND KAISER IS A HIGH QUALITY PROVIDER IT CONSISTENTLY SCORED HIGHER. THAN OUR OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ON AGGREGATE LEVEL AND IN FACTORS RELATED TO CHILDREN. PREVENTIVE CARE AND MATERNAL CARE. WE WANT TO GROW THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDIC HEALTH SPACE. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THEY WILL GROW THEIR MEDICAL ENROLLMENT BY 25% OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIVE YEAR CONTRACT. THIS MEANS THEIR MEDICAL GROWTH WILL BE AT A FASTER RATE THAN THEIR COMMERCIAL. AND MEDICARE LINES OF BUSINESS. THIS IS. MORE. AS POP. THIS HIGH CALL PLAN. UNDER THE PROPOSAL MANY THE PRO IS GETTING MORE FROM KAISER THAN TODAY THAN THE CURRENT STATUS QUO TODAY KAISER'S ALLOWED CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM OUR MANAGED CARE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS EXEMPTIONS FROM FACILITY SITE REVIEWS AND MEDICAL RECORD REVIEWS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THESE EXCEPTIONS WOULD BE ELIMINATED AND KAISER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PARK A BY BY ALL BY MANAGED CARE. REQUIREMENTS HE DAY KAISER'S ENROLLMENT IS ONLY REALLY THROUGH CONTINUITY AND FAMILY LINKAGE THAT IS A PERSON IS ABLE TO SELECT HEISER AS A THEIR MEDICARE. PLAN IF THEY HAVE HAD HIGHS IN THE LAST SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS THROUGH ANOTHER LINE OF BUSINESS SO FOR EXAMPLE PERCENT HAS UP AND PLAYER SPONSOR KAISER COVERAGE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY CAN SELECT MEDIC CAL. KAISER AS IT AS AN OPTION. BUT IN IN OUR PROPOSAL YOU'RE A IN ADDITION TO CONTINUITY AND FAMILY LINKAGE- WE ARE. OFFERING THE OPTION FOR DUAL ELIGIBLES GENERAL AND KAISER SO THINK SHE'S MEDICARE AS THEIR- KAISER. A LINE OF ARE THERE HI THERE IS THERE MEDICARE LINE OF BUSINESS. THE ALIGNMENT OF MEDIC HELL WOULD BE THAT WOULD FOLLOW AS WELL THIS WOULD OPERATE UNDER THE START CURRENT STATE- RULES. AND AS AN OPTION FOR FOSTER YOUTH WE KNOW OUR FOSTER YOUTH OFTEN TRANSITION BETWEEN COUNTY LINE DISPLACEMENT CHANGES. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A FOSTER YOUTH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A HEALTH PLAN THAT FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY CROSS THE COUNTY LINE SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION. IMMUNIZATION RECORDS- REACTIONS TO MEDICATIONS ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO MEDICATIONS FOLLOWS THE YOUTH AS THEY AS THEY TRANSITION I COUNTY LINES. OF THESE ENROLLMENT OPTIONS WOULD ALL BE BASED ON THE MEMBERS CHOICE. IN ADDITION GIVEN THE FEEDBACK WE'VE HEARD SINCE THE FOR THE INITIAL RELEASE OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE ALSO- ADDING THE ABILITY TO ASSIGN KAISER LIFE THROUGH THE DEFAULT PROCESS. SO IF IN A DID IT TO AVOID KIND OF THIS CHERRY PICKING NOTION THAT- VOCAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE RAISED. SO IF AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT CHOOSE MET A MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN AS THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE HAVING A KAISER BE PART OF A DEFAULT ENROLLMENT PROCESS- AT IN THROUGH THE COUNTIES. I AM I ALSO. THAT THIS. DOESN'T EXCLUDE VOLATILE POPULATIONS FROM KAISER ENROLLMENT AND I WOULD ALSO NTE THAT KAISER'S CASE MAKES IS PRETTY GENERALLY RELATIVELY FOR A SIMILAR TO OUR STATEWIDE CASE MIX. FOR EXAMPLE KAISER'S AND WOMAN INCLUDES ABOUT THREE POINT DISABILITIES. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL THOSE NUMBERS ARE ABOUT THREE POINT 45% TODAY KAISER PARTICIPATES IN TWENTY TWO COUNTIES FIVE WE DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THEM AND IN US I SEVENTEEN COUNTIES THROUGH AN INDIRECT CONTRACT WITH WITH THE PRIME PLAN. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER PARTICIPATE IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES WORK HAS ANY LINE OF BUSINESS AND IN THOSE THIRTY TWO COUNTY THROUGH WOULD HAVE A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER AND DIRECT OVERSIGHT. OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND PLAN THIS REALLY HURT TODAY MOST OF OUR THE RELATIONSHIP IS THROUGH A SUB DELEGATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIME PLAN I'M AND WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE DIRECT INSIGHT INTO INTO KUIPERS. OPERATIONS TODAY KAISER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PARTNER WITH OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FOR EFFORTS RELATED TO POP POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. ECON SOLD OR IN PATIENTS ESPECIALLY ACCESS. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER'S AGREED TO TERMS ON THESE PARTNERSHIPS. TOGETHER WE ARE GETTING THE- ARE MEDIA HIRES FOR NOT HIS REMEMBER TO PROVIDE AND PER SPECIALLY ACT- IN THE CENTERS THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE AND BRICK PARTNER TOGETHER TO PROVIDE MORE FOR OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. GETTING THEM TO DO MORE IN THE MEDICAL SPACE EVEN FOR THEIR NON MEMBER. I. AS THE- THAT WOULD. COME ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT IT TOLD HEALTH. CONTRACT WITH HIGHS. RATES WILL BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT MEMBER A CUTIE SO I HEALTH PLAN WILL RECOGNIZE AND REALIZE THAT RATE ADJUSTMENT AS UP AS THIS GOES LIVE NOT IN ARREARS AND NOT A TWO YEARS LATER. THE RECOGNIZING THAT MEDICAL RATES ARE BASED ON PATIENT ACUITY PATIENT MIX AGEX ADDRESS. IN CLOSING WE WANT TO. OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO WORK WITH KAISER DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS TO EXPAND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN GETS US MORE FOR OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE CHOICE CONTINUITY FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACROSS PAYER SOURCE ACROSS COUNTY LINES DECREASED INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND INCREASED QUALITY CARE. AND FINALLY WANT TO KNOW WE ARE STILL BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND COMMITTEE STAFF ON ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE SUCH AS THE DEFAULT ENROLLMENT PROCESS. THAT WE ARE INTENDING TO DO AS FLOOR AMENDMENTS I SHOULD THE MOVE BILL MOVE OUT OF CAN. YOU THANK YOU. THANKS TO THE NEXT WITNESS FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARGHA SHAKE I AM A DIRECTOR AT KAISER PERMANENTE A FOR A MEDIC CAL AND STATE SPONSORED PROGRAMS MY AREAS OF ACCOUNTABILITY INCLUDE MEDICARE'S PLAN PARTNER CONTRACTING REGULATORY REPORTING AND AUDITING AND ALSO TITLED LOCAL- CAL. COLLABORATIVES ACROSS THE STATE ON BEHALF OF KAISER PERMANENTE A I'M HERE TO SHARE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR WHICH WOULD ALLOW DCS TO ENTER INTO A SINGLE DIRECT MEDICAL CONTRACT WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A STARTING JUNE FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ARE YOU PERMANENTLY HAS PROUDLY PARTICIPATED MEDICARE FOR MANY YEARS AS A NON PROFIT HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO PROVIDE QUALITY- COVERAGE IN TEMPERATE TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. STRUCTURE BUT- BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND AND TAKE. PER HIGH QUALITY CARE TO OVERNIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IN TWENTY TWO COUNTIES. ARE TO FOURTEEN DIFFERENT CONTRACTS I WOULD LOCAL PLANS AS WELL AS- GMC COUNTIES. A SINGLE DIRECT CONTRACT ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENTE EIGHT INCREASES PARTICIPATION IN MEDICARE WITH MANAGEABLE GROWTH. THAT WOULD IMPROVE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO CRITICAL PROVIDERS AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLES. AT THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND SAFETY NET BITERS PLAY. TRANSITIONING THREE SINGLE DIRECT MEDICARE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE HAS THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS IT ADVANCES HEALTH EQUITY KAISER PERMANENTE A WILL SERVE MORE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS SUCH AS FOSTER CHILDREN. SENIORS ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE ALSO KNOWN AS DUAL ELIGIBLES AS WELL AS OTHER LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. IT INCREASES ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE HAS BEEN NOTED KAISER PERMANENTE IS THE HIGHEST QUALITY MEDICARE PLAN IN THE STATE. ROGER COMMITTEE WILL ALSO EXPAND AS DIRECTOR BOSS NOTED- TO MEDIC CALLIN ROMAN INTEND ADDITIONAL COUNTIES FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO COUNTIES. THIS REALLY ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENT TEAM MEMBERS TO KEEP THEIR SAME DOCTORS THERAPISTS HOSPITALS ELECTRONIC. CETERA NO MATTER WHAT COUNTY THEY RESIDED. RATHER THAN HAVING TO NAVIGATE A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF CARE. IT REDUCES ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY IT INCREASES STATE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT A DIRECT CONTRACT WILL REMOVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAYERS MAKING THE MEDICARE PROGRAM EASIER TO ACCESS FOR MEMBERS. AND ALL STREAMLINED STATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE CONTRACT. AND FINALLY IT RESPECTS LOCAL CONTROL ARE YOU PERMANENTLY WILL HAVE MO USE WITH COUNTIES AND WILL COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL HEALTH PLANS COUNTIES AND THE SAFETY NET. I DETERMINING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IMPLEMENTATION OF CALLING POLICIES AND DELIVERY OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR IS A FULLY BALANCED APPROACH THAT WILL ALLOW KAISER PERMANENTE A TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE. FOR ORDER NUMBER MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN A WAY THAT IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT AND COMPLEMENT THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND THE SAFETY NET DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE LIKE TO THINK WE ARE. AND THE STAFF MISTER CHAIRMAN HOW YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER YOUR WORK TO HELP SHAPE AND STRENGTHEN THIS THIS LEGISLATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR LEADERSHIP WE'VE ALSO APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND LONGTIME PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. WE'RE NOT THERE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THIS PROPOSAL AND WE VALUE YOUR INPUT. WE WELCOME FURTHER CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS PROPOSAL MOVE MOVES FORWARD. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL LAST FOR OUR OF OPPOSITION WITNESSES TO COME TO THE TABLE. AND AS WITH OUR- PROPONENTS OF THE OF THE BILL YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES- TO SPLIT AMONG YOU. THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STEPHANIE SONNENSCHEIN CEO OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE ALLIANCE'S OPPOSITION TO BE TWO SEVEN TWO FOUR IN WHICH WE ARE JOINED BY OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OUR SAFETY NET CLINIC PARTNERS THE SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA LOCAL PUBLIC PLANS AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE ALLIANCE IS A COUNTY ORGANIZED SYSTEM LOCALLY GOVERNED PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN SERVING THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY AND MERCED COUNTIES. OUR MISSION IS ACCESSIBLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE GUIDED BY LOCAL INNOVATION. WE HAVE TWENTY SIX YEARS OF SERVING PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE THE PROPOSED DEAL IS NOT A SMALL CHANGE IT IS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM ESTABLISHED PUBLIC POLICY. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS THE END OF THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM. DESTROYING APPROVING PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED FOR FORTY YEARS. THE COAST MODEL WAS CREATED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS IN THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS QUALITY AND COST. THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND BRINGING A LOCAL PLAN INTO A COMMUNITY. IS THE CONVICTION ACROSS THE LOCAL DELIVERY SYSTEM PARTNERS THAT WE CAN DO BETTERFOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH MEDICAL. IT'S K. SIR CAN GUYS HEALTH SYSTEM. KNOWS THAT SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY LOCAL CONTROL AND SELF DETERMINATION ARE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE TO SOLVING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND PUBLICLY ASSISTED MEDICAL CARE. BOTH HAVE HISTORICALLY SERVED THE BROADEST RANGE OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND OFFER THE BROADEST RANGE OF BENEFITS OUR PLANS ARE PUBLIC ENTITIES AND THUS ANY NET INCOME EARNED IS USED TO OFFER MEMBERS ENHANCED BENEFITS TO ENHANCE PROVIDER PAYMENTS AND TO INVEST IN THE CAPACITY OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE ARE HERE TO SERVE OUR FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS NO MATTER WHAT. AT WE ARE GUIDED BY PUBLIC AND NOT PRIVATE INTERESTS WE'RE COMMITTED TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR PARTNERS REGARD REGARDLESS OF PROFIT MARGIN OR POLITICS. AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE IS THE DEFINING FEATURE OF THE COAST MODEL. IT REQUIRES THAT A COUNTY GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO CREATE THE SINGLE LOCALLY GOVERNED MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN. EXCLUSIVITY IN THE COAST MODEL IS WELL ESTABLISHED DEMONSTRATED BY REGULATION LEGISLATIVE INTENT PRIOR CMS WAIVERS IN FACT THE STATE'S OWN DOCUMENTATION AROUND MANAGED CARE MODELS. THE END OF A MEDICAID CARE MODEL DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEEP SCRUTINY. SUCH A PROPOSAL SHOULD BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO A WELL ARTICULATED PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM AND SHOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. SUCH A PROPOSAL SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE A WELL ESTABLISHED SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC POLICY WITHOUT SOME SUBSTANTIAL JUSTIFICATION. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A MASSIVE OVER REACH RATHER THAN A WELL DEVELOPED NARROWLY TAILORED SOLUTION. THE DEAL ENABLED BY AB TWO SEVEN TWO FOUR IS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND A COMMERCIAL ENTITY WHICH PRIORITIZE THE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES INTERESTS OVER THE PUBLIC INTEREST. HIGHS ARE THEY CLOSED VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL THESE SELF IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS LIMITED. TO ENGAGE AND LIKE MAD CAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR COMMERCIAL PLANS THIS IS THE REAL ISSUE UNDERLYING THIS PROPOSAL. A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER DOES NOT GIVE PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL ANYTHING NEW. KAISER SERVICE PEOPLE TODAY WITH MEDI CAL THROUGH SUBCONTRACTS WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OR DIRECT CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE. HEISER SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT CONTRACTS WITH THE LOW HEALTH PLAN AND WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH THE HEALTH PLANS IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE PRIORITIZE COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. PROVIDING KAISER WITH A SPECIAL DEAL IS NOT OF THE BEST SOLUTION TO PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL ACCESS TO KAISER PROVIDERS NOR IS IT THE ONLY SOLUTION. FURTHER THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS IS ALL I PROVIDER MARKET COMPETITION DYNAMICS RURAL AREAS OF THIS MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE PROVIDER EACH SYSTEMS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA ARE DELICATE. THE ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEM MODEL SUCCEEDS AT GETTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS TO WORK TOGETHER AS PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN ADULT SYSTEM. THIS POLICY WILL DISRUPT THE DELICATE BALANCE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. A STATE POLICY THAT ADVANTAGES ONE SO ENTITIES OVER MARSHALL PROVIDERS GETTING DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN THEIR OWN COME IF POSITIONS AND PRIORITIZING THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS. THERE'S LESS SENSE. TO COLLABORATE ON PUBLIC SOLUTIONS. WHEN THE ALLIANCE BIG OP. TO SIX AGO COMPETITION ACROSS PROVIDERS WITH A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THEIR RESISTANCE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SUSTAINABLE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE ALL. THIS PROPOSAL RISKS A RETURN TO THAT MEDICAL MEMBER EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES A TWO TIER SYSTEM OR COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS ARE PROTECTED IN SERVING ONLY AS MANY PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL AS THEY PERCEIVE OF AS BEING THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WHO DO NOT PARTNER WITH THE TRADITIONAL SAFETY NET WHO DO IN FACT ENSURE ACCESS FOR ALL. EQUITY IS NOT ACHIEVED THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL VOICE. OVER THAT OF THE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH THE TRADITIONAL SAFETY NET PROVIDERS WHO HAVE SERVED THEM. THIS POLICY INFRINGES ON THE LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL SUPPORTED BY STATE STATUTE. AND ACTED ON BY FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE. SUBSTITUTING WISDOM COUNTIES THE BENEFICIARIES THE PROVIDERS WHO GOVERNOR LOCAL PLANTS TODAY. SO IN CLOSING OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS WE WHO OPPOSE HAVE BEEN RAISING OUR VOICES THROUGH EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE. TO TRY TO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT IN REAL DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE. OUR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS HAVE GONE UNANSWERED OUR EXPERTISE HAS BEEN DISREGARDED THE PROPOSAL WHICH ADVANTAGES THE INTERESTS OF A POWERFUL. IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A SYSTEM PRODUCING THE RESULT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLOSE COAST MODEL BY REJECTING THIS POLICY. TECT THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE ADOPTED A COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM OR A LOCAL INITIATIVE TO BEST MEET THEIR COMMUNITY NEEDS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE COMMENTS ON AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR ENSURE THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NOT FOR PROFIT LOCAL HEALTH PLAN THAT'S BEEN SERVING THE NEEDS OF MEDICARE ENROLLEES IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR DECADES WERE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HOLDING. THIS POLICY HEARING TO BRING GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND DIALOGUE IN THIS MATTER MY NAME IS CHAIRED MCNAUGHTON AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS CEO OF THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN. AND THAT WE COVER ALL OF THE HELP COMMITTEE SUPPORT SERVICE FOR MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MEDIC HELP MEMBERS OF THE COUNTIES OF RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THESE COUNTIES REPRESENT THE FOURTH AND FIRST LARGEST COUNTIES RESPECTIVELY BY GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY IN THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES AND THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE IT. HELPS US TO SEE PER BILLS LIKE THIS WITH AN EYE FOR EQUITY AND ALSO LIKE TO SHARE THAT WE'VE ENJOYED A VERY LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL KAISER PERMANENTE A TEAM AND CURRENTLY DELEGATE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS HAVE HAD A PRIOR DOCTOR OR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THEIR CLOTHES NETWORK. BUT THIS L. BILL ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTION ON CHOICE PREVENTS THE MOST VULNERABLE FROM AND ROLLING WITH KAISER IT IS AS IT IS SENSUALLY RESTRICTS COVERAGE TO MEMBERS WITH PRIOR INSURANCE COVERAGE OR A CONNECTION TO KAISER THROUGH A FAMILY MEMBER THAT RESTRICTION IS ACTUALLY CAUSED A DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS AND TOSE WHO ARE SENIORS ARE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. TO UNROLL ACTUALLY IN OUR PLAN I H. P. SHAPE SENIORS ARE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IS ACTUALLY RIVERSIDE AND 71% HIGHER THAN KAISER IN SAN BENITO COUNTY WE'VE ALSO HAD THE EXPERIENCE WITH KAISER WHERE THEY ASK US TO D. DELEGATE A MEDIC CAL OR MEDICARE ENROLLEES BACK TO I. H. P. BECAUSE THE CARE AND SERVICES. REQUIRED FOR THAT MEMBER OR DO NOT FIT WITH THEIR CLOTHES NETWORK OR EXPERTISE. THE WITH THOSE ENROLLEES EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES NOW IMAGINE WITH ME FOR JUST A MOMENT THAT THERE'S A NETWORK OF GAS STATIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND FOR THOSE WHO LIVE. IN THOSE LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY ACTUALLY GET TO USE THE GAS STATIONS AND THEIR CITY BUT ONLY IF THEY GET A SPECIAL INVITATION TO DO SO AND WORSE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT LIVE IN BAKERSFIELD- ON TERROR REEKER MONTEREY WELL THEY'RE TOTALLY OUT OF LUCK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T USE THE METROPOLITAN GAS STATION NETWORK. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE DROPPING THROUGH WHAT THE LARGER CITIES THEIR STOCK BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT GAS STATION NETWORK AND THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN SPECIAL INVITATION THROUGH THAT B. E. NETWORK TO JOIN WELL THAT'S EXACTLY THE SCENARIO THAT STATE. STATUS UP THROUGH THIS DIRECT NO BED BACKDOOR DEAL. CONTRACT BETWEEN THE STATE AND KAISER PERMANENT DAY WHILE EVERY OTHER HEALTH PLAN. IN THE STATE BOTH NOT FOR PROFIT OR FOR PROFIT COMMERCIAL HAS TO ABIDE BY THE RULES OF THE STATE MEDICARE CONTRACT. THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR KAISER THROUGH THIS DEAL YOU SEE THEY GET A SPECIAL DISPENSATION. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ONLY SEE PARTICULAR MEMBERS WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE A COMMERCIAL FOOTPRINT WHICH MEANS IN OUR CASE. THAT WHILE THEY MIGHT SEE PATIENTS A LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS ONTARIO RANCHO CUCAMONGA RIVERSIDE. THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE HIGH DESERT LIKE BAR STORE NEEDLES FOR THOSE WHO LIVE WITH A LOAD AFTER LIKE BLIGHT. WELL THEY'RE OUT OF LUCK. AS YOUR WILL ONLY COVER THOSE MEMBERS WHO LIVE IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WITHIN THE COUNTY WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE A COMMERCIAL FOOTPRINT. CREDIT HERE'S THE KAISER IS A TWO TO CON WITH HAVE ARE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS THAT WERE DESIGNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YEARS AGO TO SEE THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO HAD LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT ONCE AGAIN THE STATE AND KAISER ARE TRYING TO GET AROUND THE VERY STATE STAFF WHICH IS THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN. THAT WAS CREATED YEARS AGO ALLOWING THIS WHOLE DEAL TO MOVE FORWARD IF THE STATE STATUTE SAYS THAT CERTAIN CRITERIA MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS KIND OF DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THE STATE'S BUDGET AB IN INTEGRATED NETWORK THAT IS AREAS THAT THEIR STRATEGY TO CONTRACT PURCHASE TO UTILIZE JEFF COMMITTEES THAT COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE NO PRESENCE ACTUALLY CREATES A MASS STRIPPING ON ALREADY WORLD HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE IF KAISER IS GOING TO BE PULLING UP SLOTS WITHIN THE AFTER SHE STERN WORK PROVISIONAL MANDATE MEDICAL MEMBERS ARE ALREADY SEEN. HIS DO NOT GETTING IT THAT WORK ADVOCACY AT ALL THE SUPER MEMBERS BUT ACTUALLY TAKING AWAY SLOTS FROM THOSE IN HELL AND THROWN IN THIS THE G. THANK YOU TO STAY STATUE THE ALLOW THIS ANTI DEAL TO FORWARD AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR ALLOWS THE STATE TO EXEMPT KISER PROFANITY A COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN FROM RULES THAT APPLY TO EVERY OTHER MANAGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL WOULD DO NOTHING TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR VULNERABLE MEDICAL MEMBERS INSTEAD IT WOULD D THE OPPOSITE SHRINKING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY CONTACTS AND OTHER SAFETY HAS SERVICES FOR ROLE IS AN EXISTING PLANTS. THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WE BELIEVE THAT MUST BE ANSWERED THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS AT THE STATE'S INTENTION TO KNOWINGLY CREATE A CONSCIOUS BIAS TWO TIERED MEDICAL A MEDIC CAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO CARE FOR. MEDICAL IS THAT THE STATE'S INTENTION TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL PLAN TO SIDE STEP THE STATE'S NORMAL CONTRACT PROCESS IN TERMS NETWORK REQUIREMENTS A LIMITED ROLE MEANT TO THE HIGHEST MEMBERS AND CREATE A TRULY. DISCRIMINATORY PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT A SINGLE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN WHOSE TRUE FOCUS ON ON THOSE MODE VULNERABLE. BUT ON INCREASING COME PUT BILL. AS SOME WILL USE THE QUALITY ARGUMENT FOR THIS CHANGE AND AS A PASSED CEO OF A% LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER I CAN TELL YOU I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SHARE. IT'S EASY TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY IN A CLOSED SYSTEM WHERE YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL COVER COMPARED TO OUR MISSION TO COVER FOR ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH GERMAN WORD AND REALLY APPRECIATE.

I THANK YOU HIS CHAIR AND I JUST WANTED TO START OFF BY- THINKING THE AUTHOR THANK YOU IT'S- AND I SUSPECT A THINKING OF THE ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP. FOR A BRING A BILL OF BEFORE US. FRANKLY IT'S- IN. AND WHEN IT WAS FIRST REPRESENTED A IN THE PRESS IT WAS AS IF IT WAS A FATE ACCOMPLI. AND IT WAS GONNA END UP IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND THERE'S GONNA BE NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT- AND IT WAS GONNA BE FRANKLY FORCED ON ALL OF OUR THROATS WITHOUT ANY UNDERSTANDING OF IT. BY THE WAY THAT IT WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED WAS AWFUL- IT WAS NOT TRANSPARENT- AT THE END OF THE FACT THAT WERE HAVE CONVERSATION A. I. IS INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT I DO AGREE WITH THE CALLER ON A MAJOR TO SAY THIS THAT AS WELL- THAT OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO. QUOTE COMFORT- IT I'M- AT THE STATUS QUO. PERRANCE SB. THERE HAS TO BE DIALOGUE AND DEBATE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS A CORRECTLY SO AGAIN I WANT TO THINK OF THE AUTHOR AND THINK THE CHAIR HAVING THIS TODAY BLOWING AND THE SUN TO DISCUSS. THIS THAT BEING HAD A DAY. OF COME FROM THE- FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME- AND THE ONE THING THAT THE- THE GENTLE LADY HAD A HEADS HAD SAID I'D MADE I CREDIT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU SAID- THAT THIS IS THE END OF COUNTY OR- COUNTY OR- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT THIS IS THE END OF THE COUNTY ORGANISES. WELL AS I EMPHASIZED IN. SIX THE COUNTY ORGANIZED SYSTEM IS UNIQUE IN THAT AT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PARTNER WITH LOCAL PROVIDERS TO FORM A SINGLE ALL MANAGED CARE PLAN TO SERVE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES. AT THAT BY. PROCESS BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS TO HAVE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS ONLY THROUGH ONE HEALTH PLAN. PROPOSE IN. COMMERCIAL INTO THE ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM COMMUNITIES THEREBY RENDERING US I GUESS WOULD BE LOCAL INITIATIVES ARE PERHAPS WERE GEOGRAPHIC MANAGED CARE COUNTIES. HAS THE POLICY WASN'T DESIGNED TO A CHANGE IN THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH MODEL. RATHER THE TO THE CRAP COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEM MODEL SEEMS TO BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THAT BUT IT ENDS US BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE A SINGLE PLAN THAT IS. WE GOT BURNED INCLUDING HAVING BENEFITS TREES ON OUR BOARD PROVIDERS LOCAL COUNTIES ABOARD THE RISERS PRESENTED OF SO IT IS THE END OF THE COSTA. ACTORS THAT HAVE OPENED UP ON OUR COMMUNITIES AN ABS WELL I THINK THE IMPACT IS THAT IT. REALLY WEAKENS THE DECISION MAKING THAT HAPPENS LOCALLY IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE SERVED BY COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS. CURRENTLY THIS FOR THAT WE WORK THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS BE FOCUSED ON THE SAME GOALS THAT WE BE PART PULLING IT. RUSSIAN THE PUB COMPETENT. A PRICE PROVIDERS IN PARTICULAR OUR SERVICE AREA IS UNIQUE AND I THINK YOU CAN HEAR THAT IN THE COMMENTS- FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE BOTH SUPPORT SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING. IT CAN BEFORE HELLO HAS FIFTY EIGHT. TWENTIETH AND THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT VERY. DIFFERENT- SETS OF COMMUNITIES AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN THE REGION THAT I SERVE. THERE'S AND YOU KNOW. DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND THE NORTH OF THE COUNTY OR THE SOUTH THE OTHER IF YOU'RE ON THE EAST OR WEST SIDE OF A COUNTY- RESIST. ALL OF THE COMMUNIST SYSTEMS FOR ALL OF THE STATE TO GO. TO CALL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW. SICKENING IN THE THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MATTER PRO. ARE YOU SURE THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS- DON'T OPPOSE THIS- BECAUSE THE KAISER DOES IT BETTER AND THAT SALUTE WE NOT AND THAT KAISER THE I THINK IT WAS A BIRD 2% PERCENT THAT LOCAL FROM MY BOARD'S PERSPECTIVE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT KAISER. THIS IS AN IT ABOUT MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POLICY THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM MODEL WAS BROUGHT IN IN THE EIGHTIES BECAUSE THE SUCH AS THE GOAL YEP IN THE DOOR PRIVATE WRITERS TO BE ON YOUR- AND HELP DICTATE THE POLICY THAT WILL GUIDE HOW THE HEALTH PLAN OFF IT'S THE I. AND WHAT WE- BY OUR COMMUNITY AS WE TALKED THIS THIS WITH THAT. STATION THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH MEDIC CAL THEIR OTHER. THE COUNTY ORGANIZED SYSTEM HEALTH SYSTEM REALLY BREAKS THAT DOWN BECAUSE WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER. MAKE DECISIONS SHARED USE OF RESOURCES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CAPACITY. TO HAVE PROVIDER IMPAIR THEIR THE RESULT. OTHER HIS. EXCELLENCY PROVIDER SERVICES. IN OUR COMMUNITY IN SANTA CRUZ THIS IS A NOT TO SERVE THE MEDICAL RELATION. TO THE BOTH IN THE- POPULOUS. THE WAY THE COULD. CAN YOUR- SYSTEM PART OF THEIR NETWORK. HAVE TO BE TO SUPPLY HEALTH THEY COULD DIRECTLY CONTRACTED THE PROVIDER I UNDER DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS AND I HEAR SO MUCH TODAY AND THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CHANGES HARD AND CHANGE SALUTE. BUT THIS PURPOSE. WAS SENT TO DIVERT. A SASS ABOUT CHANGING THE CO MODEL LOCAL HEALTH PLANS GET A 20% CUT FROM FROM KAISER WILL UPDATE WHY WOULD THEY GET THAT. AWFULLY I AND I DON'T. OF A LOT OF AWFUL LOT BASED I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TO A TERMS OF THE TWENTY PER CUT MY UNDER. IS THE- MISTER HE BURKE MY AND ENDING IS THAT THE OF HELP ON THAT SUB. WITH KAISER WHICH WE DO NOT BECAUSE THE NOT TO. OUR SIR. THIS BECAUSE CUT. ALL OF THOSE THAT ARE MEDICAL FOR EGGS BUT TERM CARE SERVICE THEY DON'T BY ME MAJOR OR TRANSPLANT AND SO THE HEALTH PLAN THE VAST BEEN OF SIR TO PAY BUT THE HAVE TO RETAIN COORDINATION OVER SERVICE THAT HIGH DOESN'T. WHAT IMPACT IT'S GONNA HAVE THE RAW ARIZONA COMPACTS I DON'T QUITE GET THE GAS STATION AN ANALOGY YOU HAVE. THAT I CAN COME BACK TO BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO ASK SOMEBODY IS SOMEBODY FROM KAISER- OKAY. SO SOME GENTLEMAN SAID THAT THAT KAISER. ALREADY SEES ONE THIRD OF THEIR MEDIC CAL THAT PATIENTS I'M I'M ONE THING I'M STRUGGLING WITH- IN THIS- AND BY THE WAY THIS DOCUMENT THAT STUFF. TO GO GREAT I'M GLAD THAT HAD A- LITTLE PUT IT. OTHER SOME CONVERSE IS I KNOW BUT- BECAUSE p- IF YOU IF YOU READ IT BUT THIS IS THE BEST THAT I'VE SEEN OF ACTUALLY PUTTING IT ALL IN ONE. TAKE THE DOCUMENT YES. THE THING THAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS WHAT'S THE CRUX OF ALL THIS WHAT'S- WHAT'S THE STATE'S INTEREST. IN IN IN IN DOING THIS IF- IF KAISER ALREADY THESE MEDIC CAL PATIENCE. WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE A STATEWIDE STATE WHAT CON. WITH PROP. MY ORGANIZATION- THAT DIDN'T GO THROUGH AN RFP PROCESS HOW YA- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING NEW- HERE IF THERE'S NO BENEFIT TO THE STATE AND SO I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THAT WHAT I DID AND BY MIB ITS PARENT IN MY- BOOK BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T STILL HAS A IN MEDIGAP. THAT'S I'M GONNA STOP SEEING. IT IS THE MIKE IS HELLO- THAT THE ORGANISE HAD TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION IN TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF A DEAL SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THIS. IN IN DOING THIS- BECAUSE REALLY THE STATE ALL OF US TOGETHER- SHOULD BE THAT SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT. MISTER CHAIRMAN DIRECTOR BOSS ANSWERED THAT ORIGINAL QUESTION AS IT TIES INTO CAL AIMAR ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDICO AND THEN WILL HAVE- A ROOF SHAPE CANCER SUBSEQUENCE. SO WE WILL WATCH GROW THE PIE OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS WE WANT THAT KAISER'S PRESENCE THERE ARE HIGH QUALITY PLAN WE WANT THEM TO DO MORE IN THE MEDICAL SPEAKS AND THROUGH THE PROPOSAL GETTING THEM TO BE MORE THAN THE STATUS QUO- IN IN REGARD TO THE- IN ABOUT CAN'T WE- KEEP THIS. QUOTE SAMPLE AND NO. CENTRAL VALLEY COUNT. HI SCHOOL WAS A MEDIC A SUBCONTRACTOR IN THOSE COUNTIES BUT THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PRIME PLAN. AND KAISER THEY CAN COME TO AGREEMENT AND SO THEY WERE NOT ABLE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRESENCE. IN SOMERSET L. A. COUNTY AS A MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN AND SO THROUGH THIS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WILL ENSURE. THAT HIGH THERE WILL BE TWO FIFTY AND GROW THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICAL SPACE. NO WE- WRITER WE NEED MORE SPECIAL. SAYS AT BROUGH THIS ARRANGEMENT WE ARE ALSO GETTING THEM TO PROVIDE- SPECIALLY CARE ACT THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER SO FOR NOT HIGHS ARE MADE. OR TO PUT PAID IN MEDI CAL BE WHAT THE TODAY. HOW DO WE GET THEM TO PARTNER WITH OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS HOW DO WE GET THEM TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER BETTER CARE FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES. IS THERE ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION I KNOW THAT THIS DOESN'T ISN'T SPECIFICALLY A CONTRACT WITH KAISER. BUT IT'S KAISER RIGHT IT'S KAISER IS THERE ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION THAT COULD MEET- THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD MEET HE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A BECOMING AN H. A H. C. S. P. THE CONCERTS ARE NOT HAPPY TO HAVE DIRECTOR BOSS ANSWER THE QUESTION DURING OUR OPENING COMMENTS THOUGH I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT PROP YET. INTO BEING TOLD. WELL WITH INTEGRATED CARE AS THAT CAN BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO ITS MEMBERS NO I YEAH I AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I MEAN THAT THE CHECK I MEAN. REALLY THAT THAT THIS IS. THIS IS KAISER AND THERE'S BEEN VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO GET A FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO COME UP WITH THAT SAME MODEL TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF BECOMING AN H. C. S. B. RIGHT. RIGHT I MEAN HI THERE IS UNIQUE THAT THEY ARE ONLY ONE THAT IT STUFF. HAVE THIS. HERE AT MEDICARE LINES BUSINESS SO HI THROUGHOUT PIERCE WE'RE WE'RE TO ELIMINATE THAT KIND OF TWO TIER SYSTEM BETWEEN COMMERCIAL CARE AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE REALLY HOW WHO ARE PARTNERS THAT CAN HELP US GET TO IT TO THAT QUALITY CARE AND REALLY MAKING THE OUR- OKAY. AND THEN ONE QUICK. IF I CAN ASK JERRY WITH IN MY DISTRICT HAVE GOT SOME VERY VERY RURAL AREAS- YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN A SMALL SMALL TOWN IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK OF THOSE- HOBBY. A COMMUNITIES. AND THE IMPACT THAT THEY WOULD WOULD HAVE OF A TELL ME AGAIN WHAT. OF WHAT THE ARE YOU SUGGESTING AGAIN THE YOU CAN MAYBE DUMP ON THE GAS SURE NOW THINK TRIED. DUMP ALLEGE CA TO MAKE THE DOT. DUMB FOR US SO WHAT IT PACKED. AN ON A- COMMUNITIES APOLOGIES FOR BEING ON THAT IS MEMBER BECAUSE IT IS A CONFUSING SAID OUR UNDERSTANDING AND AGAIN WE WERE NOT PART OF CRAFTING ALL OF THIS BEEN HELPFUL AT THE TABLE TO HOW CRAFT THIS WE COULD'VE WERE THROUGH SOME THINGS TOGETHER IF AT THE TIME IT WAS CREATED THERE WE COULD HAVE HAD A BOY THE BEEN STATE IN. AND THEN PUT THE GRATED APPLE IS THAT KAISER WILL HAVE BASICALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THOSE KAISER MEDICARE MEMBERS IN LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS WITHIN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE THEY HAVE ALREADY. A COMMERCIAL FOOTPRINT 3% THE CLINIC INFRASTRUCTURE OR HOSPITAL WHERE THEY ACTUALLY REPLIED TODAY. FOR THOSE AS ZIP CODES THOUGH THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA WE'RE FOR YOUR DISTRICT. SEARCH OR THEY MAY HAVE CONFESSED. THOSE BOXES COULD NOT CHOOSE KAISER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLINIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT SO IN OUR SITUATION WE ACTUALLY COVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE EMPIRE ALL TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES NOW. THAT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED BY KAISER TO FILL THAT SO THERE IS. THE SIX CONST THROUGH THIS TO IT WILL BE UNDERSTAND THROUGH THIS DIRECT CONTRACT IS IT ZIP CODE SPECIFIC INSTEAD OF COUNTY SPECIFIC WHERE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE REQUIRED TO SEE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE NO GEOGRAPHIC. ACTUAL LOCATION WELL SPOKE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS OR NOT IT DOES BECAUSE I WAS JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS. THAT THE FIRST HEARING WE GET A LITTLE BIT TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH- SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH- YOU ARE OFFERING UP A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL OF THAT. THAT MISTER SO. UP B. I'M INTERESTED IN HAVING- SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TRY TO MAKE THE BILL A LITTLE BIT BETTER I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO THE CAN YOU THE CONSULTATIONS AND TO LOOK AT AND CONSIDER THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH PLAN THERE ARE MET WITH THEM. MY IS. PLANNING A MEETING WITH LATER THIS WEEK AS WELL I WILL SAY THAT MANY OF THEIR AMENDMENTS ARE OVERLY LIMITING OR REMOVES NECESSARY LANGUAGE. SOME HAPPY TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH AMENDMENTS WE CAN- WHEN IT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THOUGH COMING BACK TO WHERE YOU STARTED IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE DEPRECIATE THE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU TEACHER. THE CHRISTMAS VIZAG V. AND THEN STIR MCCARTY.

MAY BE POSSIBLE YOU KNOW. THIS IS GONNA BE ABLE TO CHERRY PICK. NEVER COME INTO THE- I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS A- BOTH THE CHERRY PICKING AS WELL AS- WHAT YOU INITIALLY BROUGHT UP. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND WOULD LIKE TO ALSO BRING AND DIRECTOR BOSS AND- A REEF SHAKE AS WELL- IN TERMS OF CHERRY PICKING I THOUGHT WE HEARD EARLIER THERE. IS NO LOOKING AT MEDICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR DEFAULT ASSIGNING A PATIENT. SO THAT 25% TO KAISER IS OING TO BE ACCEPTING. WILL BE DEFAULT WITHOUT ANY LOOK OR EVALUATION BASED ON THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY. SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CHERRY PICK WHEN THE BLOCK. TO WHAT THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY IS. INDECISIVE ROGEL WITH WHERE. WHAT I. IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THE FOSTER CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE DUAL ELIGIBLES BOTH MEDIC CAL AND MEDICARE OFTENTIMES THERE ARE ELDERS OR COMPLEX DISEASES AS WELL AS OUR USED TO HAVE COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I WOULD CHALLENGE AND SAY THAT MANY OF THESE PATIENTS ARE THE COMPLEX PATIENTS THAT INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM CAN BEST HELP AND SERVE WITH. WITH TO BE ABLE TO NOW ASK DR FOST. AT JUST TO ALSO ADD- THROUGH THIS A CRISIS IS AS I THINK WAS ALLUDED TO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO D. DELEGATE OR RETURNING PATIENT BE STOPPED IT TOOK COMPLICATED TO IT THEY WILL THEY MUST ACCEPT ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO MEET THE CRITERIA THAT WE WALK THROUGH AND SO. REALLY THE NOTION. BEING K. I. APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE- THERE'S A FALSE I THINK STATEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AND AGAIN ON MY F. IS THE- REALLY ALL IT TOOK. THEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S WHERE I'M NERVOUS ABOUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE BY REPRESENTATION FOR MY- REAL COMMUNITIES LOT OF AMERICA'S AREAS AND SO. ANYWAY YOU CAN HELPING HIM COMPLETELY KEEP THEM AT THE TABLE AND TRULY APPRECIATE IT. WILL WILL STATE AS WE- TALKED IN PRIVATE THAT- WE ARE CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FQHCS THE LANGUAGE WASN'T READY TO INSERT IT WILL BE READY FOR FLOOR AMENDMENTS IF THIS BILL IS ABLE TO GET OUT OF. TODAY AND- WILL ALLOW. BOTH KAISER AND THE DEPARTMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS REGARDING DEMO YOU. THANK IN THANK YOU MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD HI I THINK PUBLIC OUTREACH MAKING SURE THE VOICES ARE HEARD AGIS PARAMOUNT. AND- YOU'RE DOING THIS IS IT. EVERYONE AT THE TABLE THANK YOU YEAH I THINK YOU JUST THREE THREE ISSUES BUT- BUT BRIEFLY I KNOW. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT PROCESS BUT YOU KNOW MR ARAMBULA YOU AND I CHAIR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE IN THE LAST HOUR NINETY MINUTES HERE IS WAY MORE THAN WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN THE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE BUDGET FOR THIS. PERFECT BUT AGAIN IT'S WAY BETTER THAN HAVING A JAM DOWN OUR THROATS. BUDGET TRAILER BILL. WHEN THERE'S NOT MUCH BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH TODAY. AS TODAY. THE PREPARATIONS OF FLOOR ABOVE APPLIED AND AMPLE OPPORTUNITY SO. I AND- M. SUPPORT OF WHAT THE SPEAKER SAID IS HEY THIS IS A BIG DEAL LET'S SLOW DOWN THIS THIS. UP C. SAYS N. TOOK. GRENADE MUCH YOU HUNCHED I BELIEVE IN IMPACT THIS BUT YOU THOUGHT THIS IS A ISSUE WERE PER SE I'M NOT CERTAIN ON AND I KNOW SOME OF MY COUNTIES HAVE CALLED ME AS WELL SO WHEN I GET TO THAT BUT THE FIRST QUESTION IS- I KNOW YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT KAISER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT'S BROUGHT TO US BY. AND ADDRESS. AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH ELEMENTS ARE ADEQUATE FOR CALIFORNIANS I THINK IT'S A- COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE TO CRITIQUE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT DATA AND ANALYZING IF THAT IS WHAT WE CAN MAKE IMPROVE. I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT CUTS- THERE ARE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT AND NEED WITHIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND- I'M EXCITED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH N. U. H. W. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET TO A RESOLUTION. UNDERSTANDING THERE. AUDIT TO BE COMPLETED AND THEY WOULD LIKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO COME FROM THAT AUDIT BUT BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE GUESTS ON GETTING CAL LAME STARTED BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. AND SO ON IT IS TO WORK WITH LABOR TO HEAR THOSE CONCERNS AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS AND MAKE SURE THAT KAISER IS MEETING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF- IT'S MATTER ALLEN ROWLEY'S. WILL NOW AT HIGHS ARE TO STEP IN AND ALSO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS. HI THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA- I THINK- ONE THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT- THAT SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS IS REALLY IN A NATIONWIDE ISSUE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT MORE RECENTLY DURING THE PANDEMIC US WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE IS WORKING THROUGH- THAT BEING SAID HOWEVER- IN THE PAST- FIVE YEARS AS AN EXAMPLE KAISER PERMANENT DATES ADDED HUNDREDS. OF NEW PATIENTS TO OUR STAFF AND WE CONTINUE TO ADD THEM ON A DAILY BASIS. AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO KEEP ON DOING- BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST. I THINK I BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE TO HAVE TO FILL. I'M OTHER I AREAS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS RETENTION STRATEGY THIS IS ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN OUR SYSTEM AND RETENTION IS A REALLY BIG PART OF IT- AND ANOTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT- IS THAT ONE THING THAT HAS COME OUT CERTAINLY. MORE DURING THE PAST WEEK- IS VIRTUAL CARE AND WE'VE EXPANDED OUR VIRTUAL CARE OPTIONS AGAIN FOR. THOSE MEMBERS WHO WANTED- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR MEMBERS ONE VIRTUAL. OKAY FROM. HAD CUSTOMS AVAILABLE HI TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SEAMLESS WAY THAT WE CAN SEE OUR PATIENTS IN A WAY THAT THAN MEETS THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS- I THINK I DOCTOR AMULET TO THIS- I THINK- I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ANYONE SYSTEM IS PERFECT BUT I THINK WORKING TOWARDS PERFECTION BUT THAT'S THAT'S A FAIR WAY TO PUT IT OUT RECENT- RECENT- RESULTS FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCATE HAVE HAVE HAVE SHOWN HI LADIES CORES SPECIFICALLY FOR KAISER PERMANENTE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AGAIN WE HOPE THAT THIS IS CONTINUE. OUT WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BETTER AND BETTER TO SERVE OUR OUR MEMBERS SPECIFIC TO SPECIFIC TO BE ABLE. OKAY AND THEN WHAT ONE OTHER QUESTION. SO THIS YOU KNOW COMMITTEE IS ABOUT EXPANDING HEALTHCARE ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT YOU KNOW MONTROSE HEALTH PROVIDERS LIKE YOU AND DOCTOR WOULD IS IN A NO HARM. SO THERE'S A BUNCH OF OUR CLINICS IN OUR COUNTIES THEY'RE SAYING HEY THIS IS GOING TO HARM US AND IN US PROVIDING CARE TO PEOPLE- I DON'T HAVE A LETTER HERE FROM MY COUNTY BUT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OTHERS WELL I HAVE A LETTER FROM YOLO COUNTY NOT FROM SACRAMENTO. BUT FROM UP THERE COUNTY SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOU KIND OF ANSWERED THIS WITH- MISTER MAYES QUESTIONING WHAT YOU SAY TO THE- FEEDBACK YOU GOT FROM SOME KIND OF THIS IS GOING TO HARM. THEIR ABILITY WOULD IF I CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE MEDIC CAL IN RALEIGH. A DOCTOR WOULD AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT ON A SELECT COMMITTEE WHERE WE HEARD FROM CALIFORNIANS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WE HEARD WAS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. WHEN YOU HAVE UNNEEDED LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY AND ADMINISTRATION YOU CREATE. THE AND AFFORDABILITY THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. BY FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN REDUCE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND MAKE SURE THAT MEDICARE ALL. FEES ARE GOING TOWARDS A MEDIC CAL POSS IS HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT AFFORDABILITY AND DELIVER A BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE MEDIC CALENDAR. A MISS WALDRON AND THEN MR BIGELOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A QUICK ONE QUESTION AND I THINK IT WAS KIND OF ALLUDED TO SO I JUST WANTED A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC- WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC PLAN. TO INCREASE STAFFING- TO ENSURE YOU CAN PROVIDE CARE TO YOUR CURRENT MEMBERS WHAT IS BEEN DOTSON WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO- YOU KNOW THE LAW REQUIRES WITH S. B. TWO TWO ONE WHICH I CO AUTHORED AND WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF. THAT WHICH WAS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE STANDARDS- BOTH FOR PLANS AND TO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH FOR TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE SO. YOU KNOW NUMBERS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU NEED TO BRING ON TO REACH THE GOAL OF THIS WHAT'S THE COST HOUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE COVERED. I WILL ALLOW KAISER TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION BUT SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE NEED THAT TRANSPARENCY TO HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY. CURRENTLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE PRIME CONTRACT AND SUBCONTRACT THERE'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO HAVE THAT NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT QUALITY SCORES AND LOOK TOWARDS TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM. WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL AGAIN WOULD BE SOME NECESSARY BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK KAISER TO. ANSWER WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN PREPARATION. THANK YOU SO MEMBER- WITH REGARDS TO S. B. TWO TWENTY ONE I'M HAPPY TO- TO MAYBE SHARE WITH YOUR STAFF SOME SPECIFICS ON NUMBERS BUT WHAT I CAN SHARE- IS THAT OUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD- ON ENSURING FULL COMPLIANCE AND WE EXPECT TO BE IN FULL COMPLIANCE OF S. S. B. TWO. TO TWENTY ONE BY THE JULY FIRST A TIME FRAME- AND I THINK RATHER QUESTIONED- WAS JUST AROUND- YOU KNOW I GUESS JUST. J. AND I. SITE DR PUT IT TO- IS THAT IN KERN ST DH YES HAS A VERY- EXTENSIVE A DASHBOARD THAT THE THAT THE PRODUCER ON QUALITY- IT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE I THINK ANYONE CAN ACCESS IT CAN ACTUALLY EVEN DEEPER UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT THE METRICS ARE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT- IN KERN ST- THAT DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE PUBLICLY FOR OUR DIRECT CONTRACTS I'M IN SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND- AND THREE REAL COUNT. I WITH A DIRECT CONTRACT AGAIN TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POINT ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND OUT OF THE CONTRACT- THAT KAISER PERMANENTE IS THE MEASURES WE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. BACK TO YOU I'D LIKE NOT THE DIRECT CONTRACT ASPECT. I THINK YOU KNOW PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FACT THAT KAISER PERMANENTE WILL BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS EVERY OTHER MANAGED CARE PLAN IN THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW. THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR- YOU GAVE A REALLY GOOD RESPONSE TO OUR COULD REFRAIN FROM SACRAMENTO AND IT TALKED ABOUT LAYERING. THE REAL CRUX OF THIS ISSUE IN THIS ENTIRE DEBATE IS ABOUT THE HIGHER COSTS THE PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE DISPROPORTIONATE. AND THE UNFAIRNESS OF THOSE COSTS IN YOUR BILL YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THAT LIKE READING A WHOLE NEW LAYER BY CREATING A NEW BENEFIT LATER. AT PICKING UP. FIELD AND FIND THE BABY. IS NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS LEVEL AS WE'D LIKE IT TO BE BUT IT'S STILL. A LITTLE TILTED INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY ARE WE GOING BACK AND REVIEWING ALL THIS LAYERING THAT'S CAUSING THE TRAUMA AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE ADDED COSTS. WHERE WE- UNRAVEL THE SYSTEM SOMEWHAT IF YOU WITH. AND FIXING. THE BROKEN PIECES. TO MAKE IT SO THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY BECOMES AFFORDABLE. HAPPY TO BRING IN DIRECTOR BOSS I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY THOUGH BY HAVING A DIRECT CONTRACT WE ARE SIMPLIFYING THE ADMINISTRATION AND BUREAUCRACY HEY WE NO LONGER WILL HAVE A NEED TO HAVE A PRIME CONTRACT AND TO PAY THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. WE WILL BE ABLE NOW HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY WITH THE PLAN AND WILL SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IN ESSENCE DOES I WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN DIRECTOR BOSSES WILL. END I WOULD I JUST IN ADDITION BROAD SPEAKING ON. YOU ARE. IMAGE CARE ON TRACK THAT WILL GO LIVE J. ONE TWENTY FOUR THAT WILL BE TO ALL A MAN CARE. LOCAL INITIATIVE COMMERCIAL KAISER. REALLY GETS AT YOUR POINT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY IN THOSE LAYERS OF DELEGATION. THROUGH THIS CONTRACT PLANS WILL HAVE TO JUSTIFY PROVIDER THAT RATIONALE. DELEGATING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SO THE CONSUMERS THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING FOR THESE LAYERS WHILE THEY REQUIRE THEIR THEIR THEIR THE VALUES WERE GETTING FROM A BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT. THOSE EXTRA LAYERS ARE. ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME CONFUSING TO CONSUMERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT THAT ISSUE DURING THE CONTRACT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT'S STILL IT DELIGHTS THE FACT OF THE COMPLICATED ISSUES THAT WE'RE ALL FACED WITH HERE. TODAY AND NONE THE LESS. CREATING A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP BENEFITS. WHILE YOU WILL BECOME A MORE LEAD PROMINENT IN THIS BENEFIT WE'RE HEARING TWO SIDES OF A STORY ON HOW TO REMEDY. THIS PROBLEM AND IN THE FACT THERE BECOMES A WINNER AND A LOSER. AND THAT'S THE CONCERN IS BEING PRESENTED TODAY A WINNER AND A LOSER. WHEN IN FACT WE COULD ALL WINNERS IF WE JUST TAKE THE SYSTEM AND REALLY GO BACK TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SELECT COMMITTEES FOCUSING AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TALENTED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THIS WORLD. BREAKING DOWN THE SYSTEM AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE THESE FAULTS ARE. AND BY USING SOME OF THE SYSTEMATIC PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AROUND HERE TO ADVISE US IT WOULD SEEM LIKE COMMON SENSE WOULD PREVAIL AND WE WOULD COME UP WITH A MUCH MORE. EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THEY'LL HELP EVERYBODY. DOESN'T MATTER WHO THEY ARE. AS LORD KNOWS RIGHT NOW OUR SYSTEM IS. PROBABLY SECOND TO NONE IN THE WORLD FOR CARE BUT IS COMPLICATED AND IS BEING TROUBLED. BY THE INABILITY. PATIENTS TO GET WITH THEIR DOCTORS WITH THEIR CARE GIVERS WITH THEIR HOSPITALS EVERYBODY. BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT HERE NOW SAYING WELL WHAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS YOU CAN'T DO THAT BETTER WAY FOR US TO HANDLE IS. THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TODAY. BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE IF WE DON'T TAKE AND HOW THESE DISCUSSION WE'RE ALL GONNA SAY THE SAME THING. IF WE DON'T HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS NOTHING WILL EVER GET DONE. I THANK YOUNG NEED MAYBE TAKE A STEP BACK THAT'S JUST ME TODAY. HE WAS A REGULAR- MISTER FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DOCTOR EMILY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO HEALTH COMMITTEE AND ANY WORK TO GET IT OUT OF BUDGET WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A POLICY DISCUSSION I THINK THAT THAT CANNOT BE. OVERSTATED HOW IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY WAS TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YOUR LEADERSHIP I DO FIND IT- JUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE DIRECTOR BROUGHT IT UP. WHERE THIS BILL. WAS ENCOURAGING KAISER TO GET MORE INVOLVED. HEY THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENCOURAGING KAISER TO GET MORE INVOLVED AND REALLY. EASE OF LEGISLATION TO MAKE SOME THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO IT RIGHT NOW. WHERE THE BASICALLY KIND OF TO HANDLE IT. AND THE N. MY MIND A FREE MARKET REACH BETTER RESULTS FOR EVERYBODY IN WHEN WE REDUCE OUR COMMUNITIES. ACCESS TO PROVIDERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CREATES MORE CARE- SITE WITH YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT FOR ME JUST BRIEFLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE BOARD THE CAN CAN DO THIS. WE'RE NOW KIND OF GIVE TO ONE. AND IF WE REDUCED PEOPLE'S POTENTIAL. HOW'S THAT CREATE MORE ACCESS. BUT I'LL START UP AGAIN AND THEN TOSSED IT TO DIRECTOR BOSS I THINK EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT APPLES AND ORANGES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO FOCUS ON THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF KAISER AS A PLAN. BY HAVING A PROVIDER NETWORK WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THAT THEY GROW UP TO THAT LIMIT WHEN YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS THEY MAY TAKE CONSUMERS AND THEN ATTEMPT TO BUILD THE NETWORK AFTER. WE HAVE HAD BETTER RESULTS WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THESE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND RESPECT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE UNWILLING TO GROW BEYOND THE CAPACITY THAT THEY FEEL IS. SAFE FOR THE ENROLLEES BUT WILL ALLOW DIRECTOR ASKED TO STEP IN. GREAT AND THIS IS REALLY INCREASING CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH THE EXPANSIONS THAT WE PROPOSE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO INCREASE A MEDIC CAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED TWENTY SIX TO FORTY NINE. YEARS OF AGE WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE NEW MEDICAL MEMBERS THAT THAT WILL BE JOINING ATJANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE NEED TO INCREASE CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM TO SERVE OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN THIS IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS TO DO THAT IS REALLY. HOW DO WE THINK THROUGH HOW TO BRING IN MORE QUALITY PROVIDERS TO THE MEDICAL SPACE. SO IT CAN I AM IN THIS IN THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH KAISER FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M A- THERE'S IT. IS NOT I MEAN I. AND I DON'T HAVE USED YOUR IS IN A MEETING WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IT DOES JUST SEEM A LITTLE BIT INTERESTING TO ME- THAT IF ONLY ONE PERSON OF THE BILLS RIGHT NOT ONLY ONE PERSON IS ACTUALLY IS THE CRITERIA TO. THIS CON. HOW THE EVEN IF WE'RE BRINGING ON ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE. POTENTIALLY REDUCING THEIR ABILITY TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND BRING IT INTO ONE FACILITY HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY CREATE. ACCESS AND FOR ME AS A CENTRAL VALLEY ELECTED LIKE. THAT WE CARE ABOUT. ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE MY NO DOCTOR EMILY SHE HAD LIKE YOU KNOW THIS- ANYTHING AND THAT'S WHY. I'M I'M NOT GONNA VOTE NO ON THIS I'M JUST GONNA LAY OFF OF IT TODAY BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GET FIXED- BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AND I KNOW YOU'LL ADDRESS THOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I HAVE A- COUPLE QUESTIONS- THE FIRST ONE DIRECTED AT DIRECTOR BOSS. SO THE 25% ROUTE. THE INCREASE OF KAISER- PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS WAS THAT ROUGHLY GO OUT TO IN A NUMBER NUMBER OF PATIENTS. SURE SO TODAY AT KAISER HAS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND COMMENTED FOR MEMBERS A WE THINK WITH THE RE DETERMINATIONS THAT WILL BEGIN HAPPENING ONCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- ENDS WE WILL COMMENCE REDETERMINATION FOR MEDICAL POPULATION AND SO WE SUSPECT THAT THAT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL BE REDUCED PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 800-800-5900 NO. SENATE SO FROM THE START TRACK JACKET ONE TWENTY FOUR. AT FROM THERE 220% TO LET'S YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED TO EIGHT FIFTY PROBABLY AS A STARTING POINT AND THEN GROWING 25% ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. MORE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE MEMBERS FOR CHRYSLER AND THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD AND I THANK YOU FOR TAKING LEADING THAT. THAT IS. ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF THE ENTIRE MEDICARE POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO PART OF WHAT I'M GRAPPLING WITH IS. HOW DOES THIS. IN THE C  SYSTEM. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT. I'M SORRY THAT JUST DOESN'T COMPUTE WITH ME- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AS FAR AS RURAL DISRUPTION. SPEND A LITTLE TIME TO MY DISTRICT. IN YOUR IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING THE KAISER SERVICE AREA TO STEEP SERVICE PEOPLE IN YUCCA VALLEY OR FURTHER OUT THAT'S REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DO. I DON'T HAVE A BECAUSE PRESENCE BEYOND THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA- REALLY ESSENTIALLY IN CINEMA COUNTY I'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED MILES OF MY DISTRICT. EXPANDING THE SERVICE AREA FOR KAISER TO MY ENTIRE DISTRICT BECAUSE THIS PARTNERSHIP HEALTH. DOESN'T HELP WITH ACCESS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND MAYBE AT SOME POINT AS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WHEN I COULD GET INTO IT TODAY BUT- I WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT. THIS BERMAN ACCESS POINTS AND POINT I DON'T GET SOMEBODY IN TRINITY COUNTY SUDDENLY HAVE BE A MEDIC CAL PROVIDER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HELL TO GO. THAT WILL HELP ANYBODY- AND SO THAT IS THAT IS THOSE WHO SO YOU NEED TO. IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO YOU NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO MAKE THAT WORKS I DON'T SEE HOW IT WORKS QUITE FRANKLY- SOME SO. WE MENTION A BIT AT WAS MADE. OF THREE FROM KAISER TALK ABOUT AUDIT THAT J. LACK AUDIT WAS AT ONE OF OUR AUDITS. THIS WEEK REGARDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WE'RE WHAT IS THAT AUDIT WHO DID IT. AND WHERE WHERE WHEN WE GET TO SEE THE RESULTS- I THINK MAYBE THIS IS RELATED IDEA ME SEE AUDIT AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. I THINK THIS IS- AN AUDIT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE- OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD- WITH TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS. THAT'S NOT JUST A KAISER PERMANENTE IDITAROD ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO THIS HASN'T HAPPENED YET CORRECT. SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IF YOU'RE IMPROVING YOUR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AT WHAT I A WAY WHAT I DID ALLUDED TO EARLIER WAS- RECENT QUALITY AND MEMBER SATISFACTION SCORES THAT CAME OUT OF THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCATE SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE THAT- AND I THINK ALSO. NOTABLY ININ KERN ST KAISER PERMANENTE IS SUBJECT TO- THE SAME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACCESS YOU KNOW STANDARDS AS OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS- SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE TO. SPEAK TO BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF THAT THE MANAGED CARE. FOR SITE PROCESS THAT THAT CREDIT TAKES PLACE BOTH ON THE PHYSICAL AND- WELL THEN OFF BEGINNING. THEN BECAUSE THAT'S HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ALL ANY OF US HAVE AT THIS POINT I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT DATA WITH THAT I'M NOT SUBJECT TO THAT. YET SO IF YOU HAVE THAT. DOCTOR BOSS OR SOMEONE CAN PASS THAT. THAT INFORMATION TO US AS A COMMITTEE WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WE HAVE. LOOK AT THANK MUCH PREPARE KAISER KAISER IS A FABULOUS SYSTEM PATIENTS LOVE KAISER I MEAN THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRY TO GET MORE PATIENTS INTO THE CUTTERS BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM MORE MEDICARE PATIENTS OF ECO SYSTEM SO PLEASES NOT A RUB ON ON YOUR QUALITY MEASURES BUT ONE OF THE BILL THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND OUR FRIENDS IF YOU ANY AND YOU H. W. SAY THAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE READY TO IMPLEMENT SB TWENTY ONE. THEIR LIVES IN PROVIDE. AT A PRETTY RAPID RATE- AND SO. IN AN AREA WHERE WE'RE ALREADY SEEING STRUGGLE WITH PEOPLE GETTING AXED TIME ACCESS TO CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT AND NOW WE HAVE FOSTER YOUTH. AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THOSE- I DON'T KNOW THE PERCENTAGE BUT A GREAT NUMBER OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO NEED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. I DON'T EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU'RE GOING TO. KEEP YOU KNOW GET AND BUILD THE WORKFORCE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE NOT JUST TO YOUR TO THE NEW. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT TO THE POPULATION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS THAT IN MANY CASES FEEL THEY'RE NOT GETTING ADEQUATE SERVICE. SURE I THINK AGAIN GOING BACK TO S. B. TWO TWENTY ONE- I THINK- AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT- I THINK- YOU KNOW SOMEONE TO THIS PUBLIC PROCESS YOU KNOW THAT. WAS THAT LEGISLATIVE YOU KNOW. IS IT IS IMPOSED REALLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS I'M ON ON ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND KAISER PERMANENTE FULLY EXPECTS TO BE COMPLIANT BY BY JULY FIRST. IN TERMS OF THE- YOU KNOW SOMEONE POPULATIONS HE MENTIONS IT AS YOU KNOW FOSTER USE OR- OR TO THE ELIGIBLES- I MEAN I CAN I CAN CERTAINLY SHARE YOU KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW IS GOING BACK TO DOCTOR AMBULANCE. IT WAS AT THE KAISER MODEL WHICH IS WHY WE'RE YOU KNOW. FILLING UP. PORTNER NUMBER TWO. OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS I THINK IT'S REALLY HALLMARK THAT IS THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN A GREAT SYSTEM IT'S I THINK A FOR A FOR A VULNERABLE MEMBER WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO NAVIGATE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF CARE PROVIDER GROUPS THEY GET ALL OF THEIR CARE WITHIN ONE SYSTEM AND THIS ALLOWS OUR CHRIST A- PHYSICIANS HAVE REAL TIME DATA TO IT TO VERY YOU KNOW TUESDAY TO SEAMLESSLY CREATE YOU KNOW CARE PLANS- WHICH DRIVES QUALITY QUALITIES IS DRIVEN WITH THAT. THAT INTEGRATE. AT LEAST IN PART SYSTEM HELPS YOU KNOW PER. IMPROVED HEALTH AS WE- I THINK REALLY THAT THE HALLMARK IS REALLY WITH KAISER THE SECRET SAUCE IS REALLY THAT THAT THAT THEY INTEGRATED MODEL. I GUESS I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE- THE ANECDOTAL PART THAT HERE THE A GRADE MODELS WORKING REALLY REALLY WELL WITH THE EXCEPTION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GEAR UP AND HOW YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK IN MAYBE DOCTOR DIRECTOR PROCESSING CONTACT I WOULD JUST ADD FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH JUST KIND OF FIND OUT ONE OF OUR CALVET. I'M POLICY. IT IS THE- CARE ACT ARE ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS ITEM FIVE YOUTH WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA THEY HAVE AUTOMATIC M. THAT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SO WE ANTICIPATE MOST OF IF NOT ALL OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PEER ALL SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED BY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I GIVEN THE KELLY POLICY IT. AND ALLOW US WITH WITHIN SET UP HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. MAYBE TO COME BACK TO ME AND MAYBE NOT SO. I'D LIKE I DO ONE OF THEM- SOME COMMENTS- BUT I'M I'M I'D LIKE YOU TO- ACTUALLY LIKE IT GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY DR EVERY OF CLOTHES FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. AB TWO. T. FOR WOULDN'T- THAT H. C. S. P.'S ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S OVERARCHING GOALS FOR MEDICAL. TO PRESERVE CONTINUITY OF CARE TO PROMOTE. THE HIGH QUALITY OUTCOMES TO REDUCE DISPARITIES TO REMOVE LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY BUREAUCRACY. AND THE COST. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REGULAR AND I DID THAT OUT OF ORDER SO- BUT I'M GOING TO STILL MAKE MY COMMENTS ANYWAY I COULD DO THAT AS THE CHAIR- SO JUST JUST MY COMMENTS YOU KNOW MY FOCUS ON THIS BILL HAS BEEN- WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST AMERICA BENEFICIARIES. HAVING A GREAT KAISER PRESENCE IN THE PROGRAM IS A GOOD THING- BECAUSE NOT A PERFECT PLAN ARE WE THERE IS A PERFECT PLAN- I'M SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS NEED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MENTAL HEALTH. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES. I MEAN SET BACK QUITE BECAUSE OF QUALITY SCORES AND POSITION TO BENEFIT. BILLS ARE. POP UP. APPLE KAISER CONSISTENTLY SCORES ABOVE 90% IN THE AGGREGATED QUALITY FACTOR SCORE BY COMPARISON THE AT THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS A AS TO WHY THAT IS- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IS THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS REGARDLESS OF HOW HOW THEY ARE I'VE DOT. ADDITIONALLY A KAISER HAS THIS WORK FOR ONE RELEASED IT DOES FOR MEDICAL SO IF YOU'RE A MEDIC CAL KAISER PLAN THAT MEMBER YOU'RE GONNA GET THE SAME CHARACTER THAT THE RIGHT MEMBERS GOING TO GET. IS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT. BONTA IF. IT SERVICE SURVEY. MEDICARE BENEFITS. HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING CARE PARTICULARLY SPECIALIST YET WITHIN THE KAISER SYSTEM THEY'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE- IN RESPONSE CANCERS- BY THE OPPOSITION AND WESTERN MISSING A TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THAT LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. THERE KEEP HUGELY IMPORTANT- AND IN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR PARTNERSHIP HEALTH. WHICH SERVES FIVE THE FIVE COUNTIES IN MY DISTRICT- MANY OF THEM WELL BUT THEY'RE ALL. WE'RE ALL FACING IN GENERAL- CHALLENGES WITH ACCESS BECAUSE THE ROLE NATURE THE COUNTIES SO. A SIMPLE TO THE- THESE PLANS SIR IS IT EXPRESS. ALSO THINK THE CONCERN COME IN PART FROM A FEAR OF CHANGE- WHILE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS PROPOSAL RESULT IN SOME CHANGE. TO THEIR MODEL I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A RADICAL IS A PLANE REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE POINT 4% TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. AS EVEN A TOUCH FOR THE COUNTIES I REPRESENT BECAUSE THAT. ISN'T THERE IT NOW- SO CURRENTLY WE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES. RECEIVE CARE THROUGH SUBCONTRACTED ARRANGEMENTS WITH KAISER. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND ARE DIRECT HAS A MAJOR MET MEMBERS. THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES CURRENTLY PROPOSED OUT TO INCREASE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. TO GET KAISER TO JUST OPEN MILLION ONCE ONCE THE ONCE THE DUST SETTLES OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHT THREE OUR POINT TWO POINT IS HARD THAT'S PRETTY DARN SLOW AND CRIMINAL. THE REAL CHANGE IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES BUT THE SHIFT FROM PLANTS SUBCONTRACTING WITH KAISER THE STATE CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH KAISER. THE SINGLE STATEWIDE CONTRACT REDUCES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH IS HUGELY IMPORTANT TO DR RANDALL AND I AND MANY PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE. BY ELIMINATING THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE CHARGED BY PUBLIC PLANS AND ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A DOZEN SUBCONTRACTS SUBCONTRACTOR CONCEPT. SPENCE WAS THAT WORDS ARE TODAY- BUT THE CHANGES IN THOSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THERE IS THERE'S A COST TO THOSE ARRANGEMENTS AND PUT TOGETHER. BILL INCLUDES MISTER CAPTAIN ROMAN BY COUNTY AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. NOT NOT AND IT WASN'T EVEN ADDRESSED BY THE OPPOSITION KAISER TO ALL MEDICARE MANAGED CARE TERMS OF CONTRACT EXCEPT FOR ACCEPTING ALL POTENTIAL ROWLEY'SAND PROHIBITS KAISER FROM DENYING COVERAGE TO PEOPLE. AFTER COSMETIC OUT FOR PRO. SOURCE WHICH REP WITHOUT OF WHICH REPRESENT THE PROTECTIONS I THINK ARE CRITICAL. I CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS BUT ONES THAT FOCUS ON PROTECTING BENEFICIARIES WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS PROTECTING A BUSINESS MODEL. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THINGTHAT JUST SO THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE BECAUSE I'VE IT MATES THE WAY IT SIMPLE THE IMPLICATION TO ME IN THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED MADE IT SOUND THAT THAT THAT. IT WOULD. PLAN NOT FOR PROFIT. KAISER IS NOT FOR PROFIT THE IDEA THAT THAT IT THAT IS THAT THAT IS THE WAY IT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS YOU MAKE YOU MAKE YOU MAKE I SEE SHED SHAKING BUT THIS THIS CURRENT STATUS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE ALL NOT FOR PROFIT YOU MAY OFFER. THEY OPERATE. BY LAW THEY'RE ALL NOT FOR PROFIT THEY ARE DIFFERENT BUT THEY'RE NOT FOR PROFIT SO ANYWAY I'D APPRECIATE A FACT THAT YOU GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY WHILE I GAVE MYSELF THE OPPORTUNITY I CAN DO THAT BUT- BUT I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING OUT OF ORDER I SHOULD HAVE BUT I SHOULD SAID THAT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE UP ARM BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE'RE LOOKING A MORE. COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE AND WALDRON. WALDRON AGUIAR-CURRY. AGAR CURRY II ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA AYE BIGELOW. HELLO NO CARILLO REAL AYE FLORA OR NOT VOTING. MAIENSCHEIN.

THE PLACE TO CRIMINALIZE HOWEVER THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL THAT HAS BEEN SPREAD BY THE OPPOSITION. THE SAME GROUPS THAT ARE AN ABORTION ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND IMPRISON PEOPLE FOR STILLBIRTHS HAVE MANUFACTURED A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN USING DISTURBING AND VIOLENT IMAGERY THAT IS NOT GROUND CALL SCIENCE HAVE MIS CHARACTERIZED TO THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT STOPS THE GOVERNMENT FROM RE TRAUMATIZING GRIEVING PARENTS WHO LOSE A CHILD AFTER DELIVERY THE RESULT OF SOMETHING HAPPENED THE MESSY.

CALIFORNIA FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IF ONE HAD LAUREN WEARING REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE NAY RAW AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF HEALTH AND- YES. ABOUT SALINAS. DOCTOR SERRA. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TESTIMONY TODAY MY NAME IS DR SALINAS ANIMAL AND A BOARD CERTIFIED OBGYN MATHIS THIS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA AND FUTURE OF ABORTION COUNSEL. HERE TO. MY A. B. WHICH SIX TENS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT CRIMINALIZED FOR THE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES AS OF ANY PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE I CAN ATTEST THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT BELONG IN HEALTH CARE. THE STATE'S RAISING A DRASTIC RIGHT THE LEGISLATION TARGETING THOSE WHO GET PREGNANT. WITH THE GOAL OF CONTROLLING THEIR BODIES. YOU CAN BRING THE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES. ON THE NATIONAL STAGE JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH A WOMAN IN TEXAS WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER AND PLACED IN CUSTODY ON HALF A MILLION BOND. AFTER SHE DID WE DISCLOSED A HOT. INFORMATION BLOOD TO THE THAT SHE ITSELF MANSION ABORTION. THE CHARGES WERE ULTIMATELY DROPPED THE ONLY AFTER A MASSIVE PUBLIC OUTRAGE AFTER HER MEDICAL PRIVACY. COMPLETE INVADED BY HER MOTHER BEING SPENT INTO. TALKING IT SAYS EXCLUSIVE. STATES IN FACT. YEAH AND HOUSING HELLO. AS MENTIONED TO MANY RECENTLY CHELSEA BACKGROUND OR PRESS WERE PROSECUTED IMPRISONED FOR STILLBIRTHS. WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO FACE CRIMINALIZATION FOR THE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK INDIGENOUS OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS LGBTQ PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE WITH LOW INCOME. SHE BELIEVES VAST MAJORITY OF THESE PEOPLE. BY THEIR OWN HOSPITAL STAFF FOR THE CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO. CAN GET PREGNANT WELL FEAR SHARING POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING INFORMATION WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DUE TO CONCERN FOR ARREST. WE KNOW THAT PERINATAL. FOR EVERY PATIENT JUST AS PART IN SEEN OTHER CORRECTIVE HEALTHCARE NEEDS WILL DIFFER FOR A OCCASION WHAT IF ANYTHING UP TO SPECIFIC LOSS IF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY CANNOT IDENTIFY THE REASONS FOR PERINATAL LOSS WHY WOULD WE EXPECT JUSTICE SYSTEM AND- PRESIDENT. EDUCATION ABORTION TAKE ORALLY ARE IDENTICAL TO THAT OF SPONTANEOUS PREGNANCY LOSS AND THERE IS NO TESTS TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EARLY PREGNANCY LOSS ARE HONORABLE TO INTRUSIVE INVESTIGATIONS AND WRONGFUL PERSECUTION. WE NOT ALLOWED BURDEN TO FALTER PATIENTS PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY LOSS ARE OFTEN EXPERIENCING PAIN DISBELIEF AND GRIEF. AND WITHIN THIS EMOTIONAL TOLL NOW THEY'RE FORCED TO FEED PERSECUTION PROSECUTION AND DISTRUST THAT HAVE TAKEN OATH TO CARE FOR THEM. THIS IS CRUEL JUST FROM. FOCUSED ON GETTING BETTER. EIGHT BE THEM AND SUPPORT. THEY CAN NOT ASSOCIATION THE COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION ALL OPPOSE CRIMINALISATION OF PREGNANCY LOSS. INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION APARTMENTS THE OPS HARMS PEOPLE'S HEALTH LIVELIHOOD AND ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WE MUST MAKE CLEAR THAT PEOPLE CAN BECOME CALIFORNIA BE SAFE AND THEREFORE. REASONS I AND I'VE AB TWENTY TWO THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS PLACE. AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR SERRA ROBERT HAVE A DOCTORATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY ACTIVE INCIDENT. RECEIVE CALIFORNIA SEPT. IF HE THE IMPACTS. OF ABORTION POLICIES AND POLICIES RELATED TO PREGNANT PEOPLE TO USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AND A PUBLISHED MORE THAN NINETY PEER REVIEWED. AND IT PUBLISHED NINETY PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES ABOUT THESE TOPICS. PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE GUIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH VALUES AND INFORMED BY THE BEST EVIDENCE. FORMALISING PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IS COUNTER TO BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH VALUES AND EXISTING EVIDENCE. FROM A VALUE PERSPECTIVE CRIMINALIZING A PROSECUTING PEOPLE FOR THEIR PREGNANCY OUTCOMES CLEARLY VIOLATES CORE PUBLIC HEALTH VALUES OF AUTONOMY PRIVACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR GOVERNMENT INTERROGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR DURING PREGNANCY OR FOR THEIR PREGNANCY OUTCOMES HARMS RATHER THAN HELPS HEALTH. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT RESEARCH AT THIS TOPIC OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES OF OTHER PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT INTERVIEWED PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN HERE'S ALCOHOL AND DRUGS ABOUT BARRIERS TO PRENATAL CARE. MY RESEARCH FOUND EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES THAT A POSITIVE TOXICOLOGY TEST. IS INSUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH TODD APPEARS FROM THE CRACKED. FEAR OF JAIL FOR FEAR OF HAVING THEIR CHILD REMOVED I'M- RIGHT AS LEAVES AT PEOPLE TO PHYSICALLY AVOID AN EMOTIONALLY DISENGAGE FROM PRENATAL CARE. AS ONE PART IN SAID I DIDN'T GO WELL I WAS USING BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT IF THEY HAD KNOWN CPS WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD HAVE TO. MY BABY. ANOTHER SAID THAT. THAT WHOLE NINE MONTHS YOU'RE LIKE I CANNOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR BECAUSE IF I DO THEY'RE GONNA TAKE MY KID- PUT ME IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF MY NINE MONTHS JUST AB ONE I DELIVER. FEARS ARE WARRANTED GIVEN HOW OFTEN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SUPPORT BIRTHING PEOPLE. USE ALCOHOL AND DRUGS TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REPORT ABOUT 1% OF ALL NEWBORNS TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES THIS REPORTING IS DEEPLY INEQUITABLE. MY RESEARCH SHOWS LIKE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH PREGNANCY IS CRIMINALIZED BLACK WOMEN ARE FORTY FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE WOMEN TO BE REPORTED TO IN A IS. THE TO THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DURING THE PRIDE. SO THE SCALP THIRTY SIX OF BEERS AT THE STATE LEVEL PREGNANCY SPECIFIC ALCALA DRUG POLICIES. INCLUDING THOSE THAT STIGMATIZE AND THREATEN PUNISHMENT. WE FOUND THAT THESE POLICIES CONTRIBUTE THOUSANDS OF BABIES BORN LOW BIRTH WEIGHT OR PRETERM EACH YEAR HOUSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. IF IT WERE SIMPLY AND STIGMATIZING POLICIES HARM RATHER THAN HELP THE HEALTH OF PREGNANT PEOPLE AND A BABY. PUBLIC HEALTH VALUES THAT LIMITING THE THREAT OF STATE RETALIATION FOR BEHAVIOR DURING PREGNANCY IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BASED ON EXISTING IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWO TWO THREE. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO THE OPPOSITION. YES MY ESPECIALLY JACK HIBBS COVER TRAVEL CHANNEL HILLS AND THANKFULLY REPRESENTED ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE THIS MORNING THAT ROUTE ON THE CAPITOL STEPS. AND MY PASSION IS MORE ONE EXPERIENCE I'M A SURVIVOR OF AN ABORTION DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN. GLAD TO BE HERE BUT IN LIGHT OF ALL THAT'S WHAT I TO DRAW YOUR TO MAKE APPEAL TO OF. YOU ARE NOT DO. ANY WHAT WAS. THANK TO RESORT NOBODY LIFE FOR TALKING TO. THE OF BLOOD THAT IF IT'S PAST THAT THE PERINATAL MEANING THAT YOU CAN BE DEFINED BUT THE END IS VERY TONIGHT IS THAT ALL READ. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN A- LAZY. BECAUSE NOBODY CAN INVESTIGATE IF YOU READ THAT NOBODY CAN DETERMINE HOW THIS CHILD DIED IT WAS MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THAT A WOMAN COULD BE THE BEST OR- YOU AFTER PRAYER. AND DURING THAT TIME THE CHILD IS. DEAD WHY WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY IT'S NOT THE PROSECUTOR TO BRING ANYTHING AGAINST ANYONE THE- UP. WHAT MY ARGUMENT IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING DOWN A ROAD THAT IS NOT ONLY ONE THAT COULD BE CRIMINAL PERSONALLY I WITH MY HIGH VIEW OF LIFE ITSELF. THAT THE- IN THIS SUPPORT. HELLO LEGALIZES THE TERM OF A BORN CHILD A CHILD THAT IS NOW BEYOND THAT'S THE AGE OF DEBATE GOOD LIFE OR IS IT A BLOG OR WHATEVER. THIS IS A LIVE BREATHING CHIU. AND WE THESE THINGS FOR US AS A CO BUT WE'RE DOWN A PATH THAT IS DANGEROUS AND THAT IS AN AFFRONT ANY TODAY'S AT THE CAP STEPS SOMETHING ALL OF YOU I YOU TO NOTE OF AND I UNDERSTAND. S. B. HE IN THIS ALMOST. I UNDERSTAND IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO RETIRED THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS PRO IT AWAY NO.

THANK YOU THIS WOULD VANCE AND HUANG I'M AN OBGYN PHYSICIAN I'VE BEEN PRACTICING HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS WHEN I FIRST READ ABOUT THIS BILL AYE INDEED- THOUGHT THAT IS ABOUT- PREVENT SECURE BEEN PREGNANT AND WHO SUFFER IN A. A CLEAR AND GRUESOME INTENT CAN BE- GLEANED FROM THIS IT'S NOT THE INTENTION THAT WERE ARGUING WITH. IT IS IT'S SAID IN A BILL THAT IS PROBLEMATIC AND THE PHRASE. NATAL DEATH DUE TO A I CAN SEE RELATED BECAUSE SHOULD NOT BE INVESTIGATED. IS PROBLEMATIC FIRST OF ALL AS STATED CLEARLY IN THE BILL AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT MOST PARANASAL DEATHS. ARE HAVE REALLY NO IDEOLOGY YES THERE CAN I'M EXPLANATION FOR IT BUT THE MOST THE MAJORITY OF THESE PAINFUL DEATHS THEREFORE- UNDERTONE AND HOW CAN YOU CLASSIFY IT AS SUCH. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT MOST. OBVIOUS PREGNANCY RELATED ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS A BABY SO IF I'M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR BUT IF IT SAYS IT'S A PERINATAL DEATH DUE TO A PREGNANCY RELATED BECAUSE- LET'S STATE. A OUR GENTLEMAN AND GETS UNHAPPY THAT SHE IS PREGNANT AND THE CLOSETS- HURT TO LOSE A PREGNANCY THROUGH AN ACT OF VIOLENCE THERE'S A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION. TO CLAIM ON THE NET HEY YOU GUYS CAN'T PROSECUTE ME THIS WAS A- PREGNANCY RELATED COSTS THAT LED ME TO THIS ACTION BECAUSE AFTER ALL. WHAT HAPPENED WAS RELATED TO PREGNANCY. AND IT'S REALLY NOT. THANK YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE THINKING THAT THE CONCERNS OF INFANTICIDE ARE PARANOID RIDICULOUS HOWEVER THE MORAL ACCEPTANCE OF KILLING BABIES IS GAINING POPULARITY PROMOTED MOST RECENTLY BY PASTOR PETER. NEVER INDEED COURT IN ANY TO BE STRICTLY LEGALLY CONTROLLED AND RARE BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT AND MORE THE BOARD.

BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY. THIS CARILLO SECOND BY. A YEAR CURRY THIS WALDRON HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HI I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT WE HEARD A LOT OF LINK THE- TESTIMONY. AND- YOU KNOW THE ISSUE A LOT OF THE ISSUE COMES AROUND THE PHRASE DUE TO A PREGNANCY RELATED BECAUSE- AND- FIVE IT'S AN AMBIGUOUS IN THE BILL IS VAGUE IT'S KIND OF OVER BROAD. AND THERE MAY BE ISSUES IT COMES. WILL. FIVE M. WE ALL KNOW I WORK FOR YEARS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SPACE DEALING WITH POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION IN FACT WHICHIS REAL- YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS A PREGNANCY RELATED BECAUSE WOULD CERTAINLY INCLUDE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER PREGNANCY RELATED ISSUES. BUT THE WAY THAT IT'S SO BROAD IT COULD SWALLOW UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF WHICH COULD BE A BOTCHED ABORTION WERE BABY IS BORN ALIVE. WHAT HAPPENS THEN THERE'S NO INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE CURRENTLY- THE LAW. IS PRETTY CLEAR IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FOUR THREE FIVE. SHARES OF A CHILD IS BORN ALIVE IN THE COURSE WHEN ABORTION THE CHILD MUST RECEIVE THE CARE OFFERED A CHILD BORN IN A LIVE BIRTH. SO THERE'S NO PHAM LONGER REALLY ANY REGULATIONS OR OVERSIGHT OF THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. THIS PROVISION REGARDING BORN ALIVE ABORTION HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED. BUT AB TWO TWO TWO THREE IS PROCEEDING. RIGHT NOW AS WE WERE HEARING BUT IT WOULD STRIKE OUT. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION. ONE TWO THREE FOUR THREE FIVE. WHICH WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT A CHILD BEING BORN ALIVE IN THE COURSE OF AN ABORTION- NOTE ALSO FOR OUR YOU KNOW IT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THE SWEEPING LANGUAGE. WILL OPEN A WHOLE DIFFERENT MYRIAD OF ISSUES REMOVING CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR PERSONS WHO MAY CAUSE THE DEATH OF INFANTS DAYS OR WEEKS AFTER BIRTH AND BASICALLY ORDERS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO AVERT THEIR EYES DOING THEIR JOB AND HONORING HUMAN LIFE. SO BORN ALIVE CHILDREN ARE WITHOUT QUESTION PERSONS PROTECTED BY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. N. AS OFTEN OCCURS WITH CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE EXCESSES AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE STRUCK DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE WE'VE SEEN THESE KIND OF BILLS BEFORE SO I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. C. NINE WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO WE HAVE A SECOND I MISS AGUIAR-CURRY DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE MOST WEEKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'M WOULD LIKE TO ALSO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSING TO RESPOND TO MISS WALDRON. AND I PRETTY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS UP BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH HAS BEEN FACT CHECKED BY. WRITERS THE SACRAMENTO BEE EIGHT PM PLAYED A FACT SPECIFICALLY ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO AND THEY HAVE DETERMINED THAT. MUCH LIKE WHAT I READ IN THE BILL THAT- THE WAY THAT IS FRAME THIS IS INCORRECT ACTUALLY THE BILL SPECIFIC TO PREGNANCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED OUTCOMES. AND DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE. BUT A QUOTE THE MURDER BABIES IN THE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH. AS IT RELATES TO THE PERINATAL PERIOD MENTIONED IN THE BILL LANGUAGE THE INTENT IS TO PROTECT A PREGNANT PERSON'S EXPERIENCE. WHO EXPERIENCES THE TRAUMA OF LOSING A BABY AFTER DELIVERY. AS A RESULT OF THE PREGNANCY RELATED ISSUE. THIS BILL WOULD NOT PREVENT POLICE FROM INVESTIGATING FETAL DEATHS THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF A CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST. OR FROM. GETTING INTO. THE AS A RESULT OF AN ACT OR MISSION THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER DELIVERY. AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WOULD NOT PREVENT A THIRTIES FROM BEING ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS OF A NEWBORN CHILD TO DEATH. INCLUDING WHETHER THE CHILD WAS BORN LIVING AND WHEN AND HOW THE CHILD DIED. THE BILL WOULD ONLY PREVENT FOR THEIR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PREGNANCY THE PREGNANT PERSON. IN THE EVENT THAT THE DEATH WAS DETERMINED BY THE PENINSULA RELATED COSTS. SO I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND I'M ALSO WANNA A LOT MY IF SUCH INDULGENCE. MY THIS IS ALL. ANYTHING ELSE THEY LIKE TO WITH REGARD TO THIS SPECIFIC MATTER BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS WHAT HAS COME UP NUMEROUS TIMES. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT. PLEASE GO AHEAD. SO A. B. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PARENTS WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA OF LOSING A CHILD AFTER DELIVERY AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED DURING THEIR PREGNANCY- SO MEDICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS COULD BE- PRETERM PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES WHEN THE WATER AROUND DEPARTMENTS HE BREAKS- PRIOR TO DELIVERY- PRIOR TO WE WANTED TO- SO THIS COULD RESULT STILLBIRTH OR CAN RESULT- IN A PERINATAL LOSS AFTER A DELIVERY FROM COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS INFECTION OR THE LUNGS BEING IMMATURE. THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE. THE PASSION ON THIS ISSUE. I'M ON ON BOTH SIDES AND UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE FEEL VERY- THE NEED TO COME HERE AND ENGAGE IN THE CONVERSATION AND I ADMIRE THAT- THAT DIALOGUE. I WILL SAY I COME TO THIS. AS A MOTHER I HAVE A FIVE YEAR OLD AND A ONE YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL. AND THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY ARE GROWING UP. AND THE DEBATE THAT HAVING RIGHT ON ABORTION COUNTRY. ONE THAT. BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. WE HAVE WOMEN WHO ARE BEING PROSECUTED FOR HAVING MISCARRIAGES AND THAT IS NOT OKAY AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. AND I'M SOMEONE WHO'S DONE LEGISLATION TO IT. WHERE DO I CARE. AND WOMEN CAN QUALIFY FOR IVF TREATMENT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY. PLAN A FAMILY WHEN THEY WANT TO PLAN A FAMILY. BUT IN THE ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVE TO STAND STRONG AND SAY THAT IN CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN NOT BE CRIMINALIZED FLOODING STILLBIRTH FOR HAVING A MISCARRIAGE FOR HAVING AN ABORTION AND I'M% SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A MISCARRIAGE I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT IT PUBLICLY I'VE HAD AN ABORTION. THIS IS A DEEPLY PERSONAL ISSUE. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY. THAT YOU COULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR PREGNANCY RELATED LOSSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS WICKS.

BY THE THREE RIVERS FIVE THREE WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WANT TO AN EX BILL MISTER BRIAN YOU'RE UP. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON J. ENVIRON AND EMOTION YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD DID. THE GAP OF THE HIGH RISE THEY DID PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE A BILL THAT MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES TO OUR STATE'S DEFINITION OF STUDENT BLANKET INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR SOMEONE THINK AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- AS CHAIR YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE DO AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB AND MY TEAM'S GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO COLLABORATING ON THIS BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK HEALTH ACCESS FOR THEY'RE WILLING TO MULLIN IS TO WORK WITH US. YOU TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS WE CONTINUE TO WORK. IN COLLABORATION AND SOLIDARITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OFTEN PURCHASE STUDENT BLANK INSURANCE POLICIES TO COVER HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR OWN ROLE. IT'S THEIR OVERT. TWO AND A HALF MILLION COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA OF THOSE THE CALIFORNIA PART OF INSURANCE ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS RELY ON THEIR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY FOR THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS. DIDN'T BLANK INSURANCE COVERAGE IS AN EASY A RELIABLE OPTION FOR STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED OR INELIGIBLE TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS PLANS. OFTENTIMES DIDN'T BLANK INSURANCE IS CHEAPER HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. THAN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT IS STILL COMPLYING WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND STILL PROVIDE SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CODE STUDENT BLANK INSURANCE COVERAGE INCLUDES HOSPITAL MEDICAL SURGICAL DRUG. IN NURSING IS SPENT. EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ACCIDENT OR SICKNESS. THE CALIFORNIA INTEREST CALLED ALSO CHARACTERIZES SUCH BLANKET POLICIES OF THE TYPE OF DISABILITY INSURANCE. RATHER THAN AS INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY STUDENTS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS RELY ON IT AS SUCH. THIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH LABEL STUDENT BLANK INSURANCE COVERAGES INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. CALIFORNIA HAS HIGHER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE AT AN EVEN HIGHER STANDARD THAN THEY CA. YET OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED THESE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE- STUDENT BLANKET INSURANCE COVERAGE IS CURRENTLY NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR STATE'S HEALTH AND- IT'S- INTERNET DEPEND. RELY ON INSURANCE THROUGH THEIR COLLEGE UNIVERSITY ARE NOT ENTITLED. TO BENEFITS SUCH AS LIMITED COST SHARING FOR OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE WILL FIX THIS BY REDEFINING STUDENT BLANKET INSURANCE COVERAGE OF THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS WOULD BRING THESE. POLICIES INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATES RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE BY DOING CHAU WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING ADEQUATE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. THAT IS UP TO THE PART OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGH AND NECESSARY STANDARDS YOU WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. IS KATIE FISHER AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE.

I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF AND BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT IN DIFFERENT YOUR TIME I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF- THESE CHANGES ARE IMPERATIVE ESPECIALLY DURING AND AFTER THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC.

AB ON TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX AMENDS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO TARGET VALID LEGITIMATE CALIFORNIA PREGNANCY CLINICS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY- AND SUPERVISE ALL MEDICAL ASPECTS OF CLINICAL OPERATIONS. WE OFFER VITAL MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDING CRITICAL PRENATAL CARE THAT MEDICARE DOES NOT PROVIDE IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF PREGNANCY S. CHIEF OF REPRODUCTIVE SURGERY AT KAISER FOR TWELVE YEARS I KNOW THAT ULTRASOUNDS A STATION OF DATING IS THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PRENATAL CARE. WOMEN DELIVER TOO EARLY TOO LATE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY NEVER RECEIVED AN ULTRASOUND TO DATE THEIR PREGNANCY. WOMEN FIGURING OUT THEIR OWN DUE DATES ARE OFTEN OFF BY. AND THIS IS CRUCIAL THE COMPROMISES CARE. THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY PROVIDERS WHO WILL ACCEPT MEDICARE PATIENTS ESPECIALLY FOR OF VERY EARLY PRENATAL CARE STATE PAPERWORK CAN TAKE WEEKS TO COME THROUGH. AND MEDICARE WILL NOT PROVIDE EARLY ULTRASOUNDS TO DATE PREGNANCIES UNTIL THE PAPERWORK COMES THROUGH BUT PREGNANCY CLINICS DO AND WE DO IT FOR FREE. FOR A MEDIC CAL THESE FREE ULTRASOUND ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES THAT MEDICARE WOULD MISS WHILE THE WOMAN IS WAITING FOR THE PAPERWORK TO PROCESS. FOR YOU SEE CLINICS ALLOW FOR QUICK MEDICAL INTERVENTION BEFORE THE ECTOPIC PREGNANCY CAN RUPTURE. MEN'S LIVES. YET AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX TARGETS THESE PREGNANCY CLINICS FOR DESTRUCTION CALLING THEM FAKE. THE BILL FAVORS- GRANT GIVING GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE ABORTIONS AND COMPLETELY EXCLUDES PREGNANCY CLINICS THAT DO NOT. THIS EXCLUSION PRACTICE WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT WOMEN'S HEALTH REDUCING ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE FOR THIS REASON I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

WITH TO THE DETAIL DID INSPECTOR FROM THE DROP DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES HAVE APPROVED A FAKE CLINIC I HAVE HAD THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONALLY REVIEWING THE QUALITY OF CARE. AS A MEDICAL. ULTRASONOGRAPHY FOR AND A REVIEWER MEDICAL RECORDS IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THEIR STANDARD OF CARE EQUALS OR EXCEEDS WHAT I EXPERIENCED AT KAISER THE PROFESSIONALS WHO PERFORM ULTRASOUNDS OF THESE PREGNANCY CLINICS ARE LICENSE.
