IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO STOP THEIR IN THIS PROGRAM OF BOTTOM AND THEN A ARE AGREEABLE TO SUPPORTING WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OUR TRAINING AND THEM AND BRING IN EXPECT. FROM I DON'T. REVISED VERSIONS COUNTY TEN I WENT THROUGH A RATHER DRAMATIC. THANK SO WE REALLY STARTED ON DOWN HOW WE MIND THEN GO THE RIVER WAS A COP. BUT WHAT WHAT WE DID IS WE CHANGED MANY OF OUR YOU. EVERYTHING WE ESTABLISHED. ALL RESULTS ORIENTED GOVERNMENT ARMED JIHAD ALL THAT IT WAS EVERY WE OPERATE WITH BUSINESS PLANS AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO DO THIS BUT I JUST. ALL I GET IS. HOW MANY FISH DO WHAT WHAT COST AND I'M NOT BACK TO APPRECIATE PRESENTATION BUT BUT YOUR YOUR BUSINESS PLAN AND TWENTY SIX SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHAT IS SAID WE'RE GONNA DO THIS MENTORSHIP PROGRAM AND- THIS MANY. THIS PAGE AND RESULTS WERE LOOKING FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU'D SAY THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AND THIS IS WHAT THE ACTUAL. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA. TWENTY NINETEEN AND YOU DO IT AGAIN. THE NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO HAVE A CRACK. WHAT WE WOULD DO IT WHAT YOUR GOAL WAS AND HOW YOU MET YOUR GOAL THAT WE CAN TRUST BY WHAT WE'RE SPENDING AND WHETHER. WELL I'M- AB VALLEY STATE DID YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF WRITTEN ANALYSIS THAT HERE'S WHAT WE- THIS YEAR'S WAS OUR VISION. AND A YEAR LATER HEY HOW DO WE NEED THAT IN DID WE MEET THE GOALS RIVER BETTING ARE YOU STILL DOING. CURRENTLY OUT WE ARE STILL DOING THAT OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A NEVER ENDING THING- HOWEVER UP TO THIS POINT OUR RETENTION SUCCESS RATE IS 92% WELL HOW DO YOU MEASURE THAT. TO WIN THESE GERMAN COME INTO THE PROPOSED TO THE PROGRAM. IF THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROGRAM ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS. YOU HOLD EVERYONE TO OUR STANDARD. AND IF AND ACCOUNTABLE. FOR IN THE- AND MAKE IT VERY AND THE CLEAN. UP INCLUDING ATTENDANCE AND EVERY EVERYTHING THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT AND ARE ABLE TO GRADUATE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE AND THAT'S FOR THEIR- WE CONSIDER THE END OF. THAT FIRST YEAR ONLY ABOUT RESERVE IS. THIS IS THE WE WILL HAVE A OF. THE ONE THAT.IN PARTICULAR WITH HIS FORMER PLANET ALLOWS US TO TAKE THIS MODEL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN USING LOCALLY AT VALLEY AND A PLANT TO AN ACTUAL STANDARD THAT CAN BE MEASURED. THE BUDGET CYCLE PRICES EACH TIME WE IMPLEMENT A OF BUDGET PROPOSAL WHERE TASK. DEMONSTRATING EXACTLY HOW THAT PULLED OUT AND THE SUCCESS OF IT SO THAT IS ALL IN HERE AND CAN IN OUR REQUEST. RIGHT BUT I DON'T. I HAVE BEEN IT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT THIS TEST WE SHOULD BE SEEING IT IS OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE REPLICATED RIGHT. SO THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS JUST WITH WITH OUR DATA. FROM THIS EXPERIENCE AND WHY THAT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED. TO OTHER. IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL GREAT BUT IF THE WORKING MAN I DON'T WANNA SUPPORT A PIPE DREAM. YOU KNOW. FORGIVE ME FOR BEING A LITTLE MORE. IN THE WEEDS WE DO SEE THAT SUCCESS AND WE'VE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M JUST ONE OF MANY LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE- I MEAN IT'S NOT. ENOUGH PROGRAM AND ALSO SOME PHOTOS DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE PROGRAM AND WHILE WE'RE NOT PREPARED HERE TODAY WITH WHAT. RECIDIVISM THE CITY THOSE AT AS AN- IN DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE 92% OF THEM. ACTIVELY DISSIPATING GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN SHARING THEIR STORY OF HOW IT'S TRANSFORM THEM. SO WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE AND WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO NOW WITH ALL OF THOSE ENTER. THEY ARE SO FAST. GO IF YOU TAKE ALL THE. PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THERE IN THIS AGE GROUP. AND THEN. SOME OF THEM FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO IT'S GOING TO BE A- I GUESS OF PROCESS TO SELECT PEOPLE. IT WILL BE ON THIS PROGRAM FROM THAT AGE GROUP. THEN ONCE YOU SELECTED PROGRAM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROGRAM. AND THEN. IN A CERTAIN NUMBER WE'RE GOING TO GRADUATE FROM THE PROGRAM CORRECT BUT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MARK TO BOTH SIR THIS BROKE ARE GOING TO BE. SUCCESS THAT'S WRONG WORD BUT MAYBE A NIGHT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM. AS IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITIES. SO. I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE IN TERMS OF. HOW IT IMPACTS THE WHOLE GROUP OF USED. YOU FOR FENDERS THERE IN THE AGE GROUP IN YOUR APARTMENT BUT ALSO MEASURE THE ONES THAT ENTER. AND WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS LIKE HOW MANY DROPOUTS YOU HAVE THAT WOULD BE. MANY DROPOUTS. AND THEN. WHAT'S IF YOU GO THROUGH THE FINAL PROGRAM AND COMPLETED WHAT IS THE SUCCESS OF THAT THAT SUBGROUP OF THE WHOLE. SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME VERY YOU KNOW. CUT ABOVE. YOU KNOW FIRST SIZE THE MEASUREMENT QUALITY CONTROL MEASUREMENT IS WHAT. WE NEED WE DON'T NEED ANECDOTAL KIND OF INFORMATION THAT'S NOT. IT'S NICE BUT IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T CREATE A WAIT A VALUE WAIT A PROGRAM CORRECTLY. FROM OUR STANDPOINT IN THE BUDGET YEAH WE'RE ALLOCATING MONEY HERE. SO WE HAVE TO ALLOCATED BASED ON WHAT WE THINK THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO DO IN TERMS SUCCESS. THIS SOUNDS GOOD YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO SEE SOME KIND OF METRICS I GET. OKAY BERMAN FINANCE COMMERCE ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GOING TO CLARIFY DEPARTMENTS NOT SELECTING WHICH INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATE WOULD BE MANDATORY FOR THAT AGE GROUP GOING WE'RE- AND ALSO THE VERGE REQUESTING IS A ONE TIME CONTRACT. THOUSAND TO DO EXTRA RESEARCH TO A VSP IDENTIFY AREN'T METRICS AND CUT ACTION MEASURE THE- YES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KNOWING MORE ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A HISTORY NICE. OUT RIGHT. SPENDING A WHOLE LOT OUR LAST. FOR SPENDING LESS IN GETTING A LOT MORE THAN. OUR DEPARTMENT AND- THE BELL YOUR STAFF OKAY THANK YOU FROM. OKAY I INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE SIDE OF. PLEASE COME FORWARD. HELEN ROTH DOWDEN FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WE SUPPORT THESE THESE FACILITIES WE REALLY THINK THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE INMATES BUT TAKING YOUR POINT WE REALLY THINK WITH DJJ MOVING TO HAVE I'M A THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT FOR SOME OF THE KIDS WHO MIGHT HAVE MORAL SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS SIGNATURE THERE MIGHT BE MORE RESOURCES ON THE DJJ SIDE NOW THAT IT'S MOVING. OVER THERE HHS BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT THERE'S SOME DECISIONS MADE WHERE YOU YOUNG MADE IF WE KNOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE DEAD IN ALL THAT THAT WORKING WITH COURTS TO MAKE SURE WHERE WE HAVE THOSE EFFECTIVE RESOURCES. EXPENSE RESOURCE AT THE- COUNTIES REALLY CAN'T AFFORD. THOSE KIDS WOULD GO TO THE DJJ FACILITY WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE ACCESS PARTICULARLY ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE BUT WE THINK YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON THIS I JUST MAKE SURE THAT. WHERE THOSE WITH OTHER RESOURCES ARE THAT THAT'S WHERE DOES THIS POPULATION HAS ALSO SENT THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY ANYBODY ELSE OKAY THANK YOU I THINK WE'RE ALL THIS OPEN.

RIGHT ERIC SWANSON I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR. SERVICES FOR CDC ARE. THE SECOND REQUEST YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS FOR THIRTY EIGHT POSITIONS AND TWENTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONGOING FUNDING TO CREATE AN ACADEMIC CLOUD NETWORK. HARDWARE TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCY IN PROVIDING REHABILITATIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING IN THE OFFENDER POPULATION WITH ME TODAY IS RYAN SUE SO WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR PROGRAM SUPPORT OF THE DIVISION OF PEOPLE TATIAN PROGRAMS AND ALSO ON PAGE IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS AND PLANNING DIVISION AT C. C. R. THANK YOU. JOHN GOOD MORNING SIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS FRANCES AGAIN AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF A PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR THE DIVISION OF RESULTED A PROGRAMS. TODAY I'LL BE GOING OVER A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. THE DIVISION RECENTLY EXPANDED ON A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS INCLUDING LITERACY POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL TRAINING. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY ATTEMPTS TO LAYER THE CRITICAL FOUNDATION OF STANDARD TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND TO THE CDC OURS EDUCATIONAL CLASSROOMS. ULTIMATELY CREEPING MORE DOUBLE TECHNOLOGIC. WITH THE AIM OF BETTER PREPARING THE POPULATION IT'S LEAVING AT THE ENTERING THE COMMUNITIES CREASING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT CONFIDENCE. IN TOTAL AND IS REQUESTING FORTY THOUSAND THIN CLIENTLAPTOPS ROLLED OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS TO REALLY COVER ALL ACADEMIC CLASSROOM SETTINGS COVERING STUDENTS IN LOWER LITERACY ALL THE WAY UP TO COLLEGE LEVEL PROGRAMMING. THESE THEN CLIENT LAPTOPS IN TO BE AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION WHEN COMBINED WITH THE PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOUD NETWORK AS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE AND REAL IT'S GOING TO IMPLEMENT A LEARNING PROCESS. ALONG ALL. AVAILABLE TO ALL. ALL STUDENTS. THOUGHT FOODS PROGRAMS I READING RISE. AS TECH. IN ONLINE HIGH SCHOOL PRESS RECOVERY. AND TESTING SOLUTIONS. THIS SOFTWARE. IS REALLY SET ON OUR THAT WE HAVE NOW SITS ON COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY AND DIFFICULT IMAGE TO MODIFY IN VERY CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET STUDENTS BOTH ENGAGED AND A TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT- ONE HAS ACCESS TO IT THIS PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMPLISH ON THOSE THOSE. YEAR'S CURRENTLY IMPORTANT. THESE THAT THE CLIENT LAPTOPS HAVE A PRODUCT SUITE. THINK MICROSOFT OFFICE OR GOOGLE DOCS AND ALLOWED. WHICH ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO CHECK THEM OUT AND POTENTIALLY WORK OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM WHEN I'M IN THEIR CELLS I MEAN THAT'S IN PARTICULAR. ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL POPULATIONS THAT ARE WORKING ON PAPERS ON THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD TO HAND WRITE TERM PAPERS. HANDWRITTEN PAPERS TO THE TEACHERS THAT'S REALLY A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR REALLY CREATING A STANDARD. TECHNOLOGICAL BASE OUR STUDENT POPULATION. WELL THIS IS AN INTENDED TO SUPPLANT ANY FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION. THE GOAL HERE IS TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND REALLY GIVE OUR STUDENTS ENVIRONMENT AN OPPORTUNITY THE SIX. THE COMMUNITY I'M WITH THE MOST BASS TECHNICAL. THEY'RE GOING TO FACE PLEASE. THINGS RIGHT JOB MISSION. GO TO THE STATE JOB WEBS THOSE OF BEING THAT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO WHILE THEY'RE IN AND- ULTIMATELY I JUST REALLY ALLOWS OUR POPULATION TO HAVE ONE LAST DRESSER. UPON RELEASE AND SO THIS IS REALLY A- WE BELIEVE CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP. I'M WITH ON PAGE TWO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF CDC ARE- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS ANYTHING. MORE AT OKAY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S SO G. E. D. COLLEGE LEVEL. MAYBE LIFE EXPERIENCE EDUCATION. CAN YOU GIVE ME THE BREADTH OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. YES THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO REALLY INTEGRATE ABOUT 50% OF THE CLASSROOM TIME INTO THIS TECHNOLOGY BASED AND SO. WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY BASE YOU HAVE A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT CAN GO ACROSS. EVERYONE IN LOWER LITERACY LEVELS ALL THE WAY UP TO COLLEGE OF A PROGRAMMING. THINGS LIKE CANVAS ARE BLACK FOR THE DISSIPATING AND- IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED AND SPECIFICALLY. A SOFTWARE THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE READING HORIZONS WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE LOW AND LOWER LEVEL. FOCUS AND- THE SOFT. INTELLIGENT A SENSITIVE KIND OF MONITORS PEOPLE'S RESPONSES CAN ULTIMATELY CONTINUE DEVELOPING QUESTIONS AROUND AREAS THAT THEY MAY BE STRUGGLING THE SAME GOES FOR ARE ASKED TAX SOFTWARE THAT HELPS WITH HIGHER LEVEL LITERACY AND AN ONLINE HIGH SCHOOL CREDIT RECOVERY SO REALLY THE BREADTH OF EVERYTHING WE OFFER AN ACADEMIC CLASSROOMS IN THE STOCK. THAT WE HAVE. THIS THROUGHOUT THE FUSIONS BEING IN ONE PLACE FOR CLASSROOMS AND STUDENTS TO ACCESS ALL THE TIME. YOU HAVE A IS A LIKE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE POSSIBLE OR MASTERS DEGREE. POSSIBLE IN RECENT YEARS THE C. R. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND- TO KERR HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANT AND IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL WE DO HAVE A EXPANSION OF OUR BASS IS TO BE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN RUNNING AT CAL STATE LA- THAT. HAS BEEN. THROUGH FRANCE PASSED AWAY AND OUR ASKING TO THE NOW PROGRAM SLIGHTLY I'M AND THAT'S IN A PROPOSAL THIS BEFORE THIS BODY. WHEN I WENT WOMEN'S PRISON LAST YOUR THEY WANTED TO HAVE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE ONLINE PROGRAM I THINK I MENTIONED TO YOU. CAN YOU GIVE ME A- ASTANA SO WHERE ON WOMEN'S FACILITIES WILL HAVE THESE PROGRAMS ALSO BOTH OF THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES ARE AN OFF BUDGET PROPOSAL TO HAVE A FOUR YEAR OFFERING SPERMATIC. OF THE LET THE LESSER A WINNER EXPLORE ON THIS IS. SPECIAL EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS TO BE DONE% THROUGH AN EVALUATION OF THE PERSON. TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AS AN AND WHAT OTHER DISABILITIES THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT INHIBIT THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND THEN A- INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN DEVELOPED FOR THAT PERSON IS THE PROCESS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SO EACH PERSON AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL HAVE A- INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN. OF THE EDUCATION PLAN WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY. SELECT COUNSELORS IF THEY NEED BEHAVIORAL COUNSELING OR EDUCATIONAL COUNSELING SPECIAL. GROUNDS FOR A DISABILITIES SUCH AS DYSLEXIA OR SOME OTHER KINDS OF READING DISABILITY. OTHER KINDS OF DISABILITIES THERE IS. AND A DAUGHTER CLEO USE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE EXACTLY THE NUMBERS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER GOTTEN AN ANSWER- THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF INMATES IN OUR FACILITIES THAT. WE WOULD QUALIFY AS- LEARNING DISABLED IT PROBABLY WOULD NEED. SOME KIND OF APPROACH LIKE THAT. ON TO THE TERM AND WHAT THE PROPER. PROGRAM IS IN ALL SUSAN PRETTY GOOD. TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION OFFER READING PROBLEMS FOR ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS. OF I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GROUP WE HAVE AN IN OUR COUNTY COURT PARENTS HELPING PARENTS AND WERE INVOLVED IN THAT. OUR FAMILY. OF WHICH- HAS TECHNOLOGY. TOUR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF READING DISABILITIES DIFFERENT KINDS OF. PROCESSING PROBLEMS HOPES THE STUDENT GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF LEARNING SO HOW CAN YOU CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE A- IDEA OF WHAT YOU THINK WHO HOW YOU WITH A GERMAN. HOW MANY OF YOUR INMATES WOULD BE UNDER THIS CATEGORY IS THERE AN IDEA. OR AND THEN WHAT KIND OF SERVICES WHAT THEY HAVE IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ARENA THAT YOU WOULD OFFER WITH THIS PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL ASSESSMENT AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE- SOME OF THOSE. THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED THEY DO YOU OFTEN THERE ARE TEACHERS WILL RESEARCH SOME OF THE- HISTORICAL ON DOCUMENTS THAT COME WITH THEM FROM OTHER SCHOOLS AND SO IF THEY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED. AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP I. BASICALLY MEANT PROGRAM ANYONE THAT WOULD. IN ADDITION THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS VERY NIMBLE AND IF WE FIND A TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION THAT WILL OPEN RESPECTS. WE CANNOT. THIS WHEN. ONE SO WHAT LATE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACT TEACHERS THAT ARE TRAINED TO HELP IDENTIFY THESE THINGS WELL THEY'RE NOT FORMAL PROBABLY PSYCHOLOGIST LIKE YOU SEE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR SEE AND WORK WITH YOU STRUGGLE- WITH STUDENTS THAT MIGHT BE ALLOWED IN THE USUAL PROCESS NOT ONE TO PAY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. SO WE JUST DISPLAYING SOME OF YOUR HE WAS IT'S REALLY AS A RESULT OF SOME UNDERLYING LEARNING IMPAIRMENT WE HAVE IT IN YOUR THAT ARE FOLKS ON THE SOUTH NO HELP HERE. THIS LEARNERS ARE STRUGGLING AND ALSO WE HAVE TEACHERS DEDICATED TO. BOTH COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES THAT TUDENTS MAY HAVE WHERE TEACHERS CAN SAY THIS PERSON MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH- THE CLASSROOM AND THOSE TEACHERS WILL ALSO HAVE ONE ON ONE INCH WHERE THEY CAN PULL A- STUDENTS OUT REALLY. IT'S ON THE BURNING THAT MAY BE. WITH YOUR NEED HELP WITH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS NOW THEY CAN WALK OUT. WITH A MY LAPTOP. AT TEACHER HAVE ONE MORE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO HELP SUPPORT. OF PEOPLE GETTING LITERACY GAINS IN THE NUMERACY GAINS THAT THEY NEED BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED. SO YOU BETTER- WE GIVE ME SOME MORE ANSWERS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND- PROBABLY. I WOULD GUESS. YEAH I'D SOMEBODY WOULD CREWS. GO LOOK AT THE SOMEBODY WOULD PROBABLY LOOK INTO THIS FROM. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASPECT FROM THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT IN. A YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECIAL ED OKAY. SO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO SHOW. YOU KNOW HOW YOUR PERFORMING IN TERMS OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY WITH THE SPECIAL ED OR SPECIAL EDUC. SO CENTER MORE LIKE YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YOUR METRIC AN HOUR WHAT ARE WHAT WILL RESPECT YOU BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE- BROUGH ON THAT SO JUST. NICE A. BUT NOT NOT NOT THE NUMBERS BUT RESULTS AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE- YOUR USE SOFTWARE I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE NOT GOING ON THE INTERNET SO THAT. THEY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. RIGHT THAT IS CORRECT BUT I WILL LET DON WHO IS THE EXPERT. PUBLISHED THE SERVICE SO THANK YOU. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED A AN ISOLATED NETWORK FOR THESE MACHINES TO BE ON IT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE ESSENTIALLY THE CONTENT REMOTELY THE REAL BUSINESS VALUE HERE FOR US IS THAT- AS AS RYAN DESCRIBED WE MANAGE THE CONTENT THAT GOES ON THOSE MACHINES AND SO IF THERE'S TECHNOLOGY TO US WHEN IT. PROPERLY DEAR BE WAS REBUILT IT PROGRAMS FOR POOR THIS USE WE CAN. ENABLE THAT TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE DEVICES. THE DEVICES ARE DEFINITELY COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT ARE YOU SEPARATED FROM THE INTERNET- AND WE ONE OF THE CHECKS WE DO FROM ON INFORMATION SECURITY STANDPOINT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY. PRODUCTS WE USE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT DON'T HAVE. GATEWAY SO TO SPEAK TO GET TO THE INTERNET SO WE WANT TO MAKE THE EXPERIENCE AS CONTEMPORARY AS POSSIBLE WE OBVIOUSLY DO HAVE LIMITATIONS WE MANAGED. AND HOW DO YOU. YOU THAT YOU BACK AT EACH OTHER I AS YOUR LAPTOP YOUR- YES SO THE YES THE- SO THE MODEL WILL BE THE THEIR ROTATED LIKE THEY DON'T GET THE SAME WHAT. RIGHT EQUIPMENT EVERY. BILL BILL ACCESS THEIR CONTENT THEIR INDIVIDUAL CONTENT THROUGH- THROUGH A- AGAIN ID- AS YOU AS WE EXPERIENCE SAME THING I'M DEVICE INDEPENDENT AND SO. AND WE MONITOR AND MANAGE ALL THE CASES WITH THE MOST CONTEMPORARY AND POINT OF ICE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARES AVAILABLE TO US TO DO THAT SO WE CAN SEE. WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE DEVICE. THANK YOU OF THANK YOU. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. LUCAS MORROW THAT I OWN. WE THINK THAT THAT PROPOSAL IS PROMISING DUE TO THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM TO HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY CITIES HERE OUR- BIBLE WE HAVE CONSERVE. COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY GIVENTHE COST. OF AN INDICATION. WE NOTE TAT THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A SIXTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN CVC OURS CURRENT BUDGET CROCKETT EDUCATION. AND FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES WE ESTIMATE THAT. COULD HIRE A- DO YOU RATE ECONOMIC AND- ROBOT. THIS IS TO FIFTY HUNDRED ANNUALLY USING THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING. GIVEN THIS HIGH COST WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THE PROPOSAL BUT IN A CRUDE- TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION REQUIREMENTS CCIR TO CONTRACT WITH AN EXTERNAL RESEARCH OR DO AN EVALUATION OF THE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS IMPROVING. OUTCOMES IN THE- RELATIVE TO CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE ALLEGED CHOI CHOIR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE. EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM NO LATER THAN TEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE GIVE THE DEPARTMENT TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AND PHONE ABOUT IT SHOULD BE. THIS THEN GIVE. YOU NEED TO GO ABOUT IT. THANK YOU IT. STAFF RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY RESPONSE. WHAT THEY SAID THE FORMER FINANCE. IN REGARDS TO FOURTEEN DEMONSTRATIONS OPEN DISCUSSING IDEAS WITH ALLEGED LEGISLATURE REGARDING USE FOR FORTY METRICS HOWEVER THE MINISTRATION WANT TO EVALUATE WHAT DENNIS CURLYCOLLECTED AND ASSESSING IN FISCAL IMPACTS THE DEPARTMENT. ALSO REFERENCES OF BILL'S COMMENT ABOUT TO AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTORS AND THE CONCERN IS THAT NOT INTENDED BCP OTHER BUSY BEES MENTALLY ENHANCED EXPERIENCE OF THE INMATES TO ALLOW THEM TO DO MORE PROGRAMMING AND THERE ARE TIMES TO DO. THIS WORK. BAD THERE IS. HI TO SPACE IN COMPUTER LABS AND OVERALL JUST DOESN'T ENHANCE THAT INMATES. EDUCATION. I'M TO CARVE OUT A COMMENT ON THAT WAS JUST FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES OF HOW THIS MONEY COULD BE USED ALTHOUGH A SKYROCKETING PRODUCT EDUCATION NOT RECOMMENDED TO INSTRUCTORS. OKAY QUESTION. ON THAT- WHEN I WHEN I VISITED A LOT OF THE SOUL IS A- THE BIG CLASSES AND I BE IN THE CLASS AND ALSO IN. THE ALARM GO OFF AND- THE BILL WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEIR CELLS AND- IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY RIGHT INTERRUPTIONS. THIS THIS IS MORE FLEXIBLE TO AVOID THAT COULD YOU YOU TALK ABOUT. IN THE CLASSROOM KIND OF VERSES THIS APPROACH HELLO HOW YOU MIX THE TWO TOGETHER. MAYBE A MEASURE YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE BECAUSE IN TERMS OF OPERATING- IN A FACILITY IN TRYING TO EDUCATE THE INMATES AS I WAS IN SOME WERE THERE. THERE IS A BUT EVERY TIME AFTER TIME THERE IN THE CLASSIC GOT INTERRUPTED. THE SEVENTH SEAL IS SO WE'RE DOING IN THE DIVISION OF REAL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WERE DOING TWO THINGS TO HELP. MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ONE WE ARE TRACKING IN DETAIL ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS- BASICALLY CLASSROOM ATTENDANCE SO ANYTIME WHERE A STUDENT WOULD HAVE TO EXIT THE CLASSROOM FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ALL TEXT REVIEW THAT WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRY AND MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY BE CAUSING THOSE DISTRACTIONS. BUT TO GO TO THE LARGER POINT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THE- AND- THE CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU'RE LAYING THE QUESTION TO SAY. IF SOMEBODY HAS A COMPUTER OR THIN CLIENT LAPTOP CHECKED OUT TO THEM THEY HAVE THE ABILITY IF THEY'RE WALKING OUT OF THAT CLASS OF GOING BACK TO THEIR CELL. SIMPLY CLOSE THAT BOOKED AND WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM. WORKING OFFLINE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY MAY BE WORKING ON A CLASS BACK LATER COME BACK LATER AND- YOU WENT. I'M THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS WITH THESE MODELS THAT ALLOW. TO GET A- TIME IT BEFORE. I'M PEOPLE WERE TO LEAVE OUR SET LIST ON THAT TOPIC. WHEN YOU'RE OUT THAT ROOM. WELL DO YOU. MANY TIMES THE CLASSES ARE. THE SOME. THE BODY DOES WE DO YES CONTINUOUS. WILL THE MEASURE OF THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. WITH THIS REDUCE THAT- DO. THIS EDUCATE. LAST CLASSROOM TEACHERS I WOULD THINK IT MOST PEOPLE THINK IT WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TEACHER ABOUT THAT SAME TIME. THE CLASSROOMS ERUPTED ALL THE TIME THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING EITHER SO WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO SUPPLANT THE FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION WE DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION. BUT WITH THAT ALLOWS THE TOOL TO BASICALLY ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE SO I WILL STUDENTS WORK ON THIS SIDE THE CLASSROOM YES WOULD BE AVOID GOING PAST USES LAPTOPS NOT THE GOAL GOAL IS TO REALLY ENTER SO THAT THEY HAVE. A LOT KNOWLEDGE. ONCE SOME OF. FURTHER IF ON THIS SOME WAY THANK YOU SURE I THINK YOU CHEN AS PROGRESS TO OUR REHABILITATION FOCUS WE'VE BEEN OFFERING MORE MORE PROGRAMS AND CLASSES IN YOUR RIGHT YOU KNOW SORT OF HAVE A- LIMITED IN TERMS OF SPACE. WHAT WE CAN DO BUT ALSO BE. WE ARE TRYING TO TECHNOLOGY IN AGAIN THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SUPPLANT THE EDUCATION CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE. BUT WE'VE TRIED TO EXPAND PROGRAMMING INTO. THIRD WATCH AND OTHER AREAS OF THE WERE USING WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. FOR THE MAX AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE. YEAH I CAN PROVIDE SOME A WRITTEN STATEMENT OKAY THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC TESTIMONY ON THIS ISSUE PLEASE. ONE ROTH DOESN'T REPRESENTING SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND THE TEACHERS. IN YOU KNOW WE SEE THIS IS POSITIVE BUT WE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THE STUDENTS ARE MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT HAD A SUCCESS. IN HIGH SCHOOL WHAT IS SIXTY PERCENT- ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OF BY REMEMBER. MANY OF OUR TEACHERS TELL US ONE OF OUR MATH TEACHERS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO THEY PUT NOT MEANT THREE. ON THE BOARD AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE COME UP WITH I'M I'M SORRY SIX AND THREE ON THE BOARD AND HOW MANY PEOPLE COME UP WITH NINE IS ANSWER IT. COME UP WITH TWELVE. THEY'RE JUST SICK. THE WAY HOPING. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR OFTEN THIS ISSUE YES AS THIS WILL GIVE TIME FOR MORE ONE ON ONE INSTRUCTION. I'M THE HOURS IN THE CLASS CAN HAVE GONE DOWN WE ARE FULLY PART OF A- WE CAN. THIS SOME OF THE BUSINESSES. AROUND IS WITH. FOCUS THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE EXTRA. WE THINK THIS BE POTS. WE DON'T THINK BRINGING THIS PRO. IN FOR EXAMPLE USING IT. FOR AN INSTRUCTOR ONE FACILITY TO BE TEACHING AT ANOTHER FACILITY A SOMETHING WHAT WILL WORK. BUT THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS THAT COULD EXTEND ON. WHAT THEY LEARNED IN THE CLASSROOM THE OTHER TIME WHEN THEY'RE NOT LIKELY. ZERO A POD. WORD AND THE INTERNET. WITHIN THE I MEAN THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE. UP REALLY MIND BLANK. INSTEAD THEY NEED THIS SO WITH THAT WE HAVE SOME TREPIDATION OF NOT REPLACING TEACHERS ON THE OTHER HAND WE FEEL IT'S A REALLY POSITIVE MOVE TO ALLOW THIS TECHNOLOGY AN INMATE WILL BE WORKING WITH ONCE THEY GET OUT OF PRISON AND MOST OF THEM ALL Q. THE- TEACHER. IT PRISON- SPONSORED THE- DO THEY HAVE LIKE A SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL OR- IS THAT A REQUIREMENT. THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAD THE DISABILITIES SORRY. ASIA YOU HAVE TEACHERS THAT DO HAVE SPECIAL ED CREDENTIALS MOST OF THEM HAVE- MULTIPLE MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL- AND SOME OTHER CREDENTIALS BUT YES THERE ARE TEACHERS IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IF YOU WERE IN A REGULAR SCHOOL YOU- A WORTHY GOAL. CATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS TO A TEACHERS TRAINED TO DEVELOP CITY AND IF THEY CAN DEVELOP IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPING AN EDUCATION PLAN THAT DEALS WITH THE INDIVIDUALS DISABILITIES THEN YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR- CHIANG. AND THEIR PROGRAM FOR THE CHILD- THE BIRTH THE CHILD IN ME. YOU WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT I WOULD JUST SAY YOU MIGHT ASK YOU KNOW HOW THE NUMBERS BUT BUDGET XIN TEACHERS WITH AN- WE'VE WE'VE HAD ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UNDER OF THE I. D. E. A. UNTIL. AGE TWENTY TWO. AND HOW THAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOU KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS A DJJ BUT IT'S NOT REALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THESE INSTITUTIONS AS MUCH AS WE COULD BE LOOKING AT IT SO YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT THAT IS AN AREA OF INQUIRY. THANK YOU OKAY ANY LIKE TO. ANYBODY ELSE WHAT DO ADDRESSES ON THIS ISSUE OKAY CENTER OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE OF THE EXCITING- CORRECTIONAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE. DRUG INTERDICTION- PROJECT PROGRAM AND WE HAVE THE NEXT GROUP COME UP PLEASE. AND WE GOT ERIC SWANSON'S GONNA LEADERS I GUESS. RIGHT THE NEXT REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ANY POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWO ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND SIX POSITIONS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. GOING TO ENHANCE DRUG INTERDICTION EFFORTS BY COMPLETING ADDITIONAL DEPLOYMENTS. OF OUR CORRECTIONAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE PROJECT WHICH WE STARTED. AT HIGH DESERT. THE PRISONS WE'D LIKE TO ADD A RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. AND THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN. WITH ME IS MARION SPEARMAN WHO'S THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND JOHN PAGE FROM THE LAST ISSUE. MORNING CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS OF PANEL IS MERION BERMAN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE JEEP EMAIL PRISONS MY EYES WHEN I JUST GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW OUR DEPARTMENT BENEFIT. FROM NATIONAL VIDEOS TAYLOR IS TO THE THREE. INSTITUTIONS THAT. PENSION WHAT MADE YOU FROM FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN APRIL TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER WE IMPLEMENT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT THE HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON AND THAT IS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. I WAS ABLE TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE. IN SEVERAL CASES THE VIDEO EVIDENCE WAS ABLE TO BE USED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND WITHIN OUR INTERNAL INMATE DISPONER PROCESS. WITHOUT THAT VIDEO EVIDENCE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PURSUE CONVICTIONS AND IF DISCIPLINE BECAUSE INMATES MAY BE HESITANT TO TESTIFY BUT IT MAY BE COMPLEX TESTIMONY BIGGER SURVEILLANCE CAN BE CRITICAL ENSURING THESE INCIDENTS ARE DEALT WITH FAIRLY. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ALSO HELPS TO IDENTIFY AND IS A ILLEGAL DRUGS AND GET INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS. AS YOU TO NUMEROUS PRESENT YOU FIVE IN TOTAL ILLEGAL DRUGS CAN LEAD TO VIOLENCE AN OVERDOSE DEATHS WHICH- OUR DEPARTMENT TRULY TRIES TO. TAKE PLACE USING BILLS OF AS THE DENTIST BY THAT DRUGS HOW DRUGS INTO ENTER INTO OUR PRISONS CAN HELP US TO PREVENT INJURY BY IN ORDER BY. TO SUPPORT US IN OUR EXPANDED DRUG TREATMENT. VIDEO SERVICE ALSO HELPS IS UNFORTUNATELY WHEN EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE DISCIPLINED FOR BRINGING IN CONTRABAND INSTITUTIONS. AND ALSO IT HELPS US WHEN WE CAN TRAIN OUR EMPLOYEES. BIGGEST EVENTS CAN ALSO HELP WAS. IN MADE GRIEVANCE FOR US OF SOMEONE SAYS THAT SOMEONE HAS DONE SOMETHING IN WEAKENED THOROUGHLY REVIEW. THE INVESTIGATION WE CAN USE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE POSSIBLY WAS CAPTURED ON CAMERA. FROM FISCAL YEARS TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN OUR DEPARTMENT PROSECUTED TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES NINER IN TWENTY FIVE VISITORS AND A HUNDRED NOT NINETY ONE NINE VISITORS PRETENDING TO AND USE DRUGS ALCOHOL OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF COLONIAS. CONTRABAND INTO OUR STATE PRISONS. THOSE VIDEOS ARE VIDEO RECALL. SERVICE EVIDENCE AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES THE MINISTRY OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. AND WE STORE VIDEO FOOTAGE FOR UP TO NINETY DAYS. THE SURVEILLANCE FOR RECORDING CAN ALSO HELP WITH DAILY MANAGEMENT AN INSTITUTION IF SOMETHING IS STOLEN OR SOMETHING'S LOSS IS A TOOL THAT. CAN USED TO DO THEIR BREAD ASSESSMENT AND WE CAN DO IT PRETTY QUICKLY WITHOUT US HAVING TO LOCK DOWN THE PRISON INTO. PEARL MANGLE SEARCHES WHEN WE FIND OUT THAT SOMEONE DID BRING SOMETHING IN WE FIND OUT HOW. WE DO IT FIND THE ACTUAL. IS RE PRISONS POLLS WHICH BECAUSE IT DIFFERENT PHYSICAL DESIGNS EMISSIONS ONESELF WOMEN'S FACILITY ONCE A RECEPTION CENTER REMAINS COMMON INSTITUTIONS AND ONE IS A FACILITY THAT HAS IMPACTED MENTAL HEALTH TREAT. WELL LARGER. MOST OF THE VIDEO SERVICE IN DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS THE DEPARTMENT ALSO WISHES TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ARE RAISED FIVE ENDERS WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT. INSTALLATION OF THE THESE THREE PRISONS AGAIN WILL ASSIST US IN ITS INVESTIGATION OF BOY MISCONDUCT BROUGHT FOR MY INTEREST BROUGHT OR BY VISITORS BOB FOR BY ANOTHER EMPLOYEE. INTO TO SUBSTANTIATE THE MISCONDUCT TOOK PLACE OR TO EXONERATE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN FALSELY ACCUSE. WHEN ACT VIOLENCE OCCUR WITH VIDEO CAMERAS ARE INSTALLED I HEARING A FACIAL TO MAKE. INFORMED DECISIONS ON WHAT TOOK PLACE AND I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WERE PERSON MIGHT TELL HEARING IT SHOWS THAT THEY WERE DEFENDING THEMSELVES AND CHECKED HIMSELF. RESULTED IN IF THE VIDEO FOOTAGE SHOWS THAT IN A HEARING OFFICIALS TO MAKE AN OF POINTLESS ASIAN AND POSSIBLY A WHITE IS MISSED THE ACTUAL RULES VIOLATION REPORT. IN ADDITION THE US OF WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY PLEA CURRENCY FOR DEPARTMENT WHEN ALLEGATIONS. COME UP AGAINST EMPLOYEES AND IT WILL POSSIBLY INFLUENCE AN EMPLOYEE OR DEFINITELY OF ANDERS. WHO MIGHT BE LEERY TO VIOLATE POLICY KNOWING THAT THEIR ACTIONS COULD BE CAPTURED ON VIDEO. HOW MANY OF PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. ARE USING OR DICK INDOOR ADDICTED. IT'S MORE OF INMATES ORDER WHAT WOULD WHAT WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS YOU HAVE ON THE- OR DO STUDY THAT YEAH I MEAN IF YOU RECALL LAST DURING THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE ONE OF OUR MAJOR PROPOSALS WAS THE- I. S. UT T. I'M- STANCHION. AND I THINK I DON'T HAVE THE FIGURES IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN GET THEM FOR YOU I THINK AS PART OF THAT ONE OF THE BIG HOLES WE SAW WAS. WE'RE DOING INCREASED WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE NEED TO DO BUT- WE'RE GETTING TOO MANY. INTO THE PRISONS THEMSELVES WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE- THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THE- WILL YOU TELL US THE PRISONER RIGHT. SO WHAT IS THE COME UP TO ME WHAT'S NUMBER. WHAT WOULD. TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM A LITTLE BIT YEAH. OKAY YEAH WE CAN GET TO WITH. IN A COMMA SO THEY'LL YOU'LL PLEASE ONE O'NEILL AT THE LA L. WE THINK THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE EVERYTHING IS REASONABLE THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE WOULD HELP PROVIDE OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE WITH WHICH TO EVALUATE IN MADE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A STAFF. WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THESE THREE PRESIDENTS DO YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR. CHALLENGES WITH I'M WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S AN EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT ONE PRISON FOUND THAT IT. BUT IN SUGGESTING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAN REDUCE USE OF FORCE AGAINST INMATES AD INMATE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF USE OF FORCE AND DISCORD MEANT. SO THAT IS WHY REYES TURNS UP. THERE THANK YOU WE'RE ADDING EIGHT POSITIONS PERMANENT AND YOU WON YOUR ARE THEY JUST SIT AND WATCH THE- YOUR THEIR EARLY. DO INSTALL WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE GETTING. ANY WITH THE VIDEO THAT WOULD THERE BE A CHANCE REDUCE OTHER STAFF SEVERAL STOPS AT. TO THE RESOURCES. IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST ARE ESSENTIALLY THE STAFF TO MANAGE EQUIPMENT SO THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT ESTABLISHED VIDEO SURVEILLANCE THE PREVIOUS BROWN ADMITTED TERM RESOURCES APPLIED TO THAT. AND AS WE- THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS AND I'M AND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL. PHYSICAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT DEPLOYED. THE RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIALLY TO MANAGE- THE. THE CAMERAS THEMSELVES THE SERVER WOMEN THAT COLLECTS THE VIDEO CONTENT. IN SOME STAFF AREAS WITH WITH RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. ACTUAL MONITORING OF THE VIDEO IN SOME STAFF AREAS VIDEO. IS MONITORED LIVE IN MANY AREAS IS NOT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE- SORT OF A- WATCHING STAFF TO SPEAK IT'S MORE INTENDED TO BE AS- ESSE SPEARMAN. REFERENCED THE TOOL TO ADJUDICATE IS AFTER THE FACT SO THE BUDGET CHANGE DOESN'T ASK FOR RESOURCES TO USE FOR. WATCH. RIGHT TAXPAYERS BERBER HIRING EIGHT PEOPLE. HOW TO INSTALL EQUIPMENT TO MAINTAIN MY- THAT'S RIGHT SIR SO MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT AT. AN INMATE IN THE CITY'S MAINTAINING HARDWARE SOFTWARE THAT RUN. EQUIPMENT AFTER AND BY WORKING EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT'S GOOD TO HAVE. NUMBER IS IN GOT EVERYWHERE SO THE NEWS IS SHOWING US VIDEOS. I'M ALL KINDS OF MANAGER APPOINT. ARE ACCIDENTS THAN YOU KNOW THURMOND HE DOES ALL THE TIME BUT- IT IS- I WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT OTHER THAN HAVING GOOD DOCUMENTATION BUT- AND WE REDUCE MATT OUR SOME MORALE SO YOU HAVE AN OFFSET. WELL THE AT LEAST THE IS THE INTENT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST AS AN TO REDUCE ANY STAFF. YOU KNOW WITH SUCH SPECIALLY IN THE QUESTION. YEAH I THINK GENERAL THE THIS IS A NEW ACTIVITY THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE AND WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE- MISTER SPEARMAN WHO WAS THE WARDEN AT HIGH DESERT WHEN IT WAS IMPLEMENTED HE NOW WORKS AT HEADQUARTERS WE ARE EXPERIENCE WE NEED TO HAVE- THIS THAT CAN CONTAIN THE CAMERAS THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE LITERALLY ALL OVER THE PRISON THEMSELVES AND THEN ALSO. THE WORK BRING TO THE STANDARDS THE PROPOSAL ITSELF WHICH IS WE HAVE THE CERTAIN. NINETY DAY PERIOD WHERE WE MAINTAIN THE VIDEO. IN AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE VIDEO SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO HAVE SORT OF TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT ALLOW US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO ALL OF THAT TO OUR EXPERIENCE HAS US OF. I BELIEVE THAT THE SUSPENSION WORK NEW POSITION. YEAH I'M I'M JUST TURNED ABOUT. NO THE- BUT JUST THE STAFFING AND THE COST OUR PRISONS RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT AS A COROLLARY IMPACT FOR YOU THE TICKET WE IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING. OLOGY WE'RE SAVING STAFF AND SO THAT'S JUST WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR THAT'S FOR MIGHT BRING IT. THANK. YOU TALK ABOUT THE VIDEOS TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS SO. TECHNOLOGY LIKE THINGS LIKE THAT HOW DOES THE- PLEASE. I MIGHT BE RECESSED SIR YEAH BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE HAD A COUNTY JAIL IS. FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A- WE HAD A GUY.

SHOULD I DON'T THINK WE WANT OUT RIGHT. PLEASE AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S OF THE LOOK AND OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT- WE HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU. GOING TO ALLOW CERTAIN. THAT'S THE CORRECTIONAL STAFF TRAINING AND JOB SHADOWING PROPOSAL AND SWANSON'S GONNA LEAVE PRESENTATION ERROR. HELLO TO US. STAFF PROPOSED A WELCOME. OKAY YEAH THE FOR OUR A FINAL PROPOSAL FOR TODAY'S REQUEST FOR TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN FIFTY FOUR POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN ONGOING FUNDING AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA TO IMPROVE DEPARTMENTAL TRAINING OF INSTITUTIONAL BASE COST CUTS THE STAFF BASICALLY THERE'S FOUR COMPONENTS TO THIS PROPOSAL BURKE TING A NEW FIRST THE FOR RUNS ON TRAINING AT A FOR. PER NORTHERN SO. I JUST WHEN PROGRAM FOR NEW CORRECTION WHILE. GIVE ADDITIONAL RC POST REQUEST AND ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS. WITH ME STACEY LOPEZ WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AN EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. AND AM RIDEAU BUT DIO WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS STANDARDS AND TRAINING WHICH IS A VERY LARGE. I DON'T. OKAY I DON'T. OKAY THE AGENDA FOR THE MORE YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN I'M STACY LOPEZ I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE PIECE OFF THEIR SELECTION AN EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECRUITING HIRING AND TRAINING OF ALL PEACE OFFICERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MYSELF AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DUMB AND I BEGAN CANVASSING INSTITUTIONS OVER TWENTY FIVE- CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ONSITE INTERVIEWS WITH NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THEIR SUPERVISORS AND INSTITUTIONAL MINISTRY THERE'S TO COLLECT FEEDBACK. ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING BOTH BASIC ACADEMY TRAINING AN ANNUAL FIELD GETTING. THIS PROPOSAL WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF OUR SITE VISITS AND JUST REGARDING TRAINING NEEDS OF NEW STAFF AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. THE RESPONSES OVERWHELMINGLY INDICATED CADETS THE MORE HANDS ON REALITY BASED TRAINING TO BE BETTER PREPARED TO PERFORM BASIC REX OFFICER TASKS. WELL THE CURRENT ACADEMY TRAINING PROVIDE SOME HANDS ON REALITY BE STRAINING CORRECTIONAL TRAINING CENTER IS NOT DESIGNED AS A PRISON. WHICH LIMITS THE REALITY BASED TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY NEW OFFICERS NEED A PERIOD OF ORIENTATION AND JOB SHADOWING TO BECOME CONFIDENT AND COMPETENT IN THEIR JOB ASSIGNMENTS. OTHER SPECIFIC INSTITUTE PRIOR TO SIGN POST. THE CURRENT BASIC CORRECTION OFFICER COUNTY DOES NOT DO THE BEST JOB OF PROVIDING A NEW OFFICER WITH UNDERSTOOD. I'M ADDRESS THE GOOD JOB. LET ME CORRECT THAT AND SINCE I AM OVER THE ECONOMY. THE CURRENT BASIC RITUALS ACADEMY DOES A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING A NEW OFFICER UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS DEPARTMENTAL POLICY PROCEDURES A FOUNDATION OF UNDERSTANDING IN THE USE OF EQUIPMENT AND USE OF COURSE OPTIONS. CERTIFICATION A PEACE OFFICER STATUS. BASIC COMMUNICATION SKILLS BASIC ETHICS AND BASIC SAFETY GUIDELINES THIS HERBAL DOES FIVE CRITICAL THINGS EXPANDS THE USE OF THE FORMER WOMEN'S INSTITUTION IN STOCKTON. READING A VENUE TO TRAIN CORRECTION OFFICERS IN A SETTING CONDUCIVE TO THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF AN INSTITUTION OR REAL TIME PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE CIOS JOB RESPONSIBILITY WE SIMULATED. TEACH SPONTANEOUS DECISION MAY. INDICATE TO USE YES. NEED APPLICATION OF OPTION EXCEL. THIS OUT THIS PROPOSAL ALSO ADD. A NEW EMPLOYEE. BOB SHUDDERING WITH WILL ALLOW THE OFFICE TO LEARN THE LOCAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THEIR INSTITUTION UNDERSTAND ITS MISSION PROGRAMS AN INMATE POPULATION AND ACCLIMATE TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT PRIOR TO BEING ASSIGNED THEIR PERMANENT POST. IT ALSO INCREASES STOPPING FOR OUR IN SERVICE TRAINING OFFICES DUE TO WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NEW PROGRAM WITH ANY WITH A NEW PLAYER TATIAN JOB SHADOWING WE ALSO ARE WERE COSTING TO ADDITIONAL WE COULD TRAINING FOR CORRECTIONAL THIRDS WHICH WILL MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON THEIR SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY WITH THE FOCUS ON. TAKE THE CASE PLANNING ENCOURAGING COUNCIL. OR ACTION AND COMMUNICATION JUST TO NAME A FEW. AND FINALLY THIS PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR THE COMMISSION ON THE SAUCER SELECTION AND TRAINING OTHER. ALSO NOTICE YOU POST TO ENSURE THAT IS CRITICAL FUNCTIONS FOR PENAL CODE ARE CARRIED OUT IN AN EXPEDITIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND I. KNOW THAT WHEN I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. LOUVRE OFFICE. I WE THINK THAT THE VARIOUS TRAINING INITIATIVES IN THE PROPOSAL I DO GENERALLY APPEAR TO BE WORTHWHILE BUT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR REJECT THE CIVIC COMPONENTS OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCE HAS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T FULLY JUSTIFIED. THOSE ARE ONE SEVEN INSTRUCTOR POSITIONS FOR TRAINING THAT HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED YET AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IT WOULD. GENERALLY DO AND- THERE FOR WHAT IT'S BENEFIT WOULD BE RELATIVE TO ITS ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL COST. I'M TO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING ELEVEN OF THE FIFTEEN REQUESTED MAINTENANCE POSITIONS FOR THE NEW TRAINING FACILITY. BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT MAINTENANCE PACKAGES UNNECESSARILY LARGE. THREE WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE OUTSIDE PATROL SERGEANT AT THE FACILITY- BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THE FACILITY WOULD NEED THAT LEVEL OF SECURITY. IN THE FOURTH RELATES TO THE THIRTY FIVE A REQUESTED SERGEANT POSITIONS OR ONE PER PRISON THAT WOULD GENERALLY SUPPORT. AS STAFF TRAINING INITIATIVES ARE WORK AT THE PRISONS AND WE THINK THAT THIRTEEN OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS ARE JUSTIFIED GIVEN THAT THAT WORKLOAD IS. DRIVEN BY. NEW WORKLOAD THAT WOULD COME THROUGH WITH IF THIS PROPOSAL IS PROPOSED. I'M HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID THAT THE OTHER TWENTY TWO POSITIONS WOULD GO TOWARD SUPPORTING EXISTING WORKLOAD THAT CURRENT STAFF ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE IN A TIMELY MANNER. ESSENTIALLY WE VIEWED AND DOES THAT TWENTY TWO POSITION REQUEST AS MENTALLY IN A SEPARATE OR NEW PROPOSAL THAT DIDN'T COME WITH- THE TYPE OF JUSTIFICATION. THAT WE WOULD NEED TO SEE FOR RESOURCE REQUEST FOR EXAMPLE DATA IDENTIFYING CIVIC WORKLOAD BEING DELAYED AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DELAY I'M- AND ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATING THAT TWENTY TWO POSITIONS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THAT WORKLOAD IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AS WELL AS- WHAT ALTERNATIVE THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED. TO ACCOMMODATE THE WORKLOAD. I'M IN TOTAL AFTER AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION IF FOUR COMPONENTS AS WE SAID WE RECOMMEND OUR REJECTED THAT WOULD. MEAN THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD I'M WOULD NEED FORTY TWO FEWER POSITIONS OUT OF THE EIGHTY FIVE REQUESTED AND AN ASSOCIATE AND- SIX POINT SEVEN. MILLION FEWER DOLLARS. RELATIVE THE. FOR WHAT'S- THAT. AND THEN WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LAW DIRECT THAT TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON TRAINING OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE IMPACTED BY THESE INITIATIVES. THE SERVICE SIX MILLION LESS. SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION LAST. AS OPPOSED TO FORTY EIGHT. F. FORTY TWO FEWER POSITIONS OUT OF AN EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE TOTAL AND SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FEWER- TO REQUEST THE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT EIGHTY FIVE ELDERLY TWO YEARS FROM NOW RIGHT. ANDERSON OUR ONE YEAR. THIS IS WHERE NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. I LIKE THE COMMENT ALSO ON A REGARDING THE FACILITY THE FORMER INSTITUTIONS ARE SHUT DOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE AND AS A RESULT THERE ARE NUMBER OF AREAS OF SILLY WILL WE NEED TO REACTIVATE IMPROPERLY MAINTAINING ORDER CONDUCTED INITIAL TRAINING AT THIS VENUE. THE OUR VISION FOR THIS- TRAINING COMPLEX IS GOING TO BE FOR THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT THIS IS NOT JUST AN EXTENSION FOR THE ACADEMY BUT AROUND THE FACILITY- AS A TRAINING COMPLEX FIVE DAYS A WEEK AND OPEN IT UP TO OTHER DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS EVENTUALLY DOWN THE ROAD ALSO FOR LOCAL- LAW ENFORCEMENT TO UTILIZE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT MAYES STAFF ON SITE RESULT IN SEVERAL OPERATIONAL BENEFITS TO THE DEPARTMENT- YOU KNOW STAFF ON SITE IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCIES ABILITY FACILITATE AND COORDINATE WITH OUR PLAN OPERATIONS SUPERVISORS ME UNDER DAILY WITH ISSUES AND OUR MAINTENANCE RELATED WORK AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO SIGN STAFF TO MANAGE ANY OTHER SYSTEMS THAT IS NEEDED. SO THE MAIN PROGRAMS CONTINUE. WE DID LOOK INTO YOU TO. I'M CURRENT ALL STAFF I HAVE A COMPLEMENT OF PLANT STAFF THAT RUN THE GOAL ACADEMY BUT WITH THE WORKLOAD THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE GALL A TREATING COMPLEX IT WOULD BE- IT WOULD. ADD ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD X. THAT WOULD- XC WITH THEIR ABILITIES ARE BEING ABLE TO. OF CORRECT THINGS OF THE STOCKTON FACILITY. AND WE ALSO A CONTRACTING SO WE HAVE. THE BERMAN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON THE TENNIS. AT MANY SHATTERED HARMON A FINANCE- IN RESPONSE TO IT WE DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE MAINTENANCE STAFF WE THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN BORROW SET FROM OTHER FACILITIES IN ADDITION TO THE WORK LOAD WE NEED TO BE REALLY SAPPY MIGLIOR WITH THE SYSTEMS AT. LEAST THEY CAN BOND AND EMERGENCY. ON THE DAY THE LIFE TRAINING SERGEANTS BAD ISN'T SCHEDULED TO COME ONLINE UNTIL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO THERE'D BE MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP OUR SPORT. THE ASSOCIATED STAFF. ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE LINE AS WELL AS THE QUESTION. ONE OF. THANK YOU CENTER. THIS SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE SO I THE NEED IS AS OUR PRISON POPULATION MINING AND A GOVERNOR WHO WANTS EVEN CLOSE ONE. TOBY YOU'RE RAMPING UP WITH STAFF AND I ANY TEAMS ARE INTUITIVE SO MAYBE BY CHANNEL THE SENATOR SKINNER I'D ASK. ARE YOU THINKING WHY WHY WHERE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE WHERE THE- THE NEED TO THE DEMAND IS. JUSTIFIED EVEN GOING INTO TRACK. ONE NINE I THINK ONE THING THAT'S DIFFICULT. OR YOU IS A COMMITTEE AND SORT OF A AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE STATE BUDGET ITSELF IS THAT YOU SEE PIECES OF IT THAT I WERE TRYING TO JUSTIFY WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS. BUT YOU THERE ARE PIECES THE BUDGET WE WERE LOSING STAFF AS YOU KNOW. WE ARE OUT OF OUR CONTRACTS OF OUT OF STATE FACILITIES. ARE SORT OF RAMPING DOWN ARE IN STATE CONTRACTS. AND WE ARE LOSING STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PROPOSAL THIS IS KIND OF. ONE PIECE OF. A BIG SPECTRUM BUT THERE ARE. AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT WHERE OUR POSITION. POSITIONS ARE GOING DOWN. STAY TUNED. IF THEY GET IN USES OVER OVERTIME SO WELCOME TO OUR FIRST FIVE OF A OF THIS A YEAR YOU DID A GREAT JOB SHALL CHANNELING SENATOR SKINNER THERE TO WELCOME. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. BUT ONE OF THE DRESSES ON THE SUIT. NO I THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT WAS THE LAST. OKAY WORDS THAT. LET.
