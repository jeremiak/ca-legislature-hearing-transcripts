WELL IF MR COOLEY SAID YOU CAN GO AHEAD THEN YOU WILL GO AHEAD. A LET'S HERE. ON ITEM NUMBER. FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY FIVE BY SURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA. YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER. IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TO YOU. TO TALK ABOUT A BILL THAT IS NOT ONLY. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THROUGH OUR OUR STATE TO TALK ABOUT BUT ALSO PERSONALLY IMPORTANT TO ME -- IT IS NO SECRET THAT TOUGH NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT OTHERS ARE FACING A SEVERE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE ALSO KNOW WITHIN THAT HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE HAVE. MANY ON OUR STREETS THAT ARE NOT ONLY HOPE HOMELESS BUT ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH -- ISSUE. AS WE HAVE FOCUSED IN OUR STATE OF HAVING HOMELESSNESS. BE A PRIORITY WE SEE MANY MANY BILLS COMING OUT. THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY POINT IN TYING COUNT. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN IN ORANGE COUNTY WE E.. THAN NUMBER IS OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHAT'S EVEN MORE DRAMATIC THAN THE SIX THOUSAND IS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIE ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE COUNTY AND IN JUST MARCH. THIRTY THIRTY PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE COUNTY. THAT SOME PEOPLE FROM OTHER CUT COUNTRIES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY IN THE ORANGE COUNTY HOUSE WIFE'S IN OUR REALITY TV SHOWS. AND THINK OUR STREETS ARE PAVED WITH GOLD. AND YET WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE DYING. AND AND ALLEYS IN OUR HOSPITALS. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE DYING. BECAUSE OF ADDICTION ISSUES AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE DYING ON OUR FREEWAY SIDELINES AND IF THEY'RE NOT DYING THEY'RE LIVING THERE [inaudible] I TO SUFFERED A LOSS THIS FALL WITH MY BROTHER BILLY J. SO. BILLY IS THE SECOND YOUNGEST OUT OF MY FOUR BROTHERS AND HE DIED THIS FALL. OF BY BEING HIT BY A CAR. ABOUT. TWO TO THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE HE WAS STAYING. HE SUFFERED FOR MANY YEARS WITH ADDICTION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS HE HAD A HOME AND A FAMILY WHO CARED FOR HIM INCLUDING MY EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO SPENT MANY NIGHTS LOOKING FOR HIM? WE SPENT MANY TIMES WITH OUR LARGE FAMILY HOUSING HIM AND YET WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS. STAY ON A PROGRAM AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT NINETY DAY PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE NOT SIXTY DAY PROGRAM SOMETIMES THEY TAKE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. SO MY AB TWELVE NINETY FIVE AND I APPRECIATE SO MUCH NORMALLY THE CHAIRS COMMITMENT BUT ALSO THE CONSULTANTS WORK -- AS I WANTED. SOLUTION AND FELT THAT WE HAD ONE WITH FAIR VIEW OF THE STATE'S LAND OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN ACRES AN ORANGE COUNTY. AND THAT WE COULD ALONG WITH A HERO IT JUDGE CARTER -- WHO HAS SAID THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS AN ORANGE COUNTY OR ANY STATE A CITY? THAT WE COULD HOUSE THEM URGENTLY WE NOW KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE MANY OF THE COMMITMENTS THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND ALSO -- THE OPPORTUNITY THAT. NEEDS TO BE TAKE TO PLAN THIS CAREFULLY BUT AB TWELVE NINETY FIVE WILL ASSIST UP TO TWO HUNDRED OF THE MOST SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BY ALLOWING STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP. A TEMPORARY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AT THE FAIR VIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER A STATE OWNED FACILITY ONCE IT SEIZES AND PLEASE HEAR ME ON THAT SEIZES. TO OPERATE AS A DEVOUT DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ITH ME TODAY WE HAVE REBEKAH GONZALEZ BUT BEFORE I AND MY COMMENTS. I DO WANT TO TO NOTE THAT. I'VE HAD MANY PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS AND WHEN. THE PASSAGE OF THAT I WROTE ABOUT MY BROTHER WAS. PUT OUT I HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TEXAN ME THAT THEY PERSONALLY ARE SUFFERING THESE TYPE OF THINGS. AND I EVEN HAD SOMEBODY RECENTLY ON MY FACEBOOK SAID WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU HOUSE THEM. AND WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE TRUTH IS WE ALL DID WHAT WE COULD AND TRIED FOR SO MANY YEARS AS MANY FAMILIES DUE TO DO SO TO ASSUME THAT FAMILIES DON'T WANT TO CARE. TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. BUT WEEK COME TO A POINT IN OUR CAREERS WE HAVE TO MAKE BOLD DECISIONS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE BRAVE DECISIONS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS UP. THAT OTHERS MAY NOT LIKE OR AGREE WITH AND THIS IS A TIME IN MY TIME OF SERVING THAT THAT I DO NOT WANT TO NEGOTIATE. I DO NOT WANT TO WAIT ANY LONGER AS WE SEE PEOPLE DYING SO THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND WE HAVE REBEKAH GONZALEZ HERE. HELLO REBECCA GONZALEZ AND I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORK. WORKERS IN THE STATE I'M WITH THE DEGREE FROM AN ACCREDITED SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AS IT WILL HELP THOSE EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AN ORANGE COUNTY. SOCIAL WORKERS ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IN THE NATION AND WE HAVE SEEN THE CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THEIR HOMELESS POPULATION. FOR EXPERIENCING A MENTAL ILLNESS. ACORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ACROSS OUR NATION. CALIFORNIA IS HOME 222% OF ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. WHICH IS THE LARGEST SIZE SURE BY STATE. 39% OF THE NATION'S CHRONIC HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH IS DEFINED AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LIVED ON THE STREETS FOR OVER A YEAR OR AND ARE SUFFERING FROM. MENTAL ILLNESS RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR A TEMPORARY SHELTER UPON CLOSURE AT THE FAIR VIEW OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER TO CARE FOR THOSE IN CRISIS. MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND LONG TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES OR OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS ONCE CLOSED THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ISN'T AVAILABLE TEMPORARY. LOCATION FOR THESE SERVICES AND COULD BE RE USE FOR THIS THESE PURPOSES. FIVE THEREFORE WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B.. TWELVE NINETY FIVE THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THEIR PARENTS SOME WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND REGRETFULLY WERE IN OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES. THANK YOU CHAIR RON THANK A MEMBER OF WORK SAID OF OUR ABOUT YOUR CONCERN. ON THE HOME THIS POPULATION AND THEN ALSO WHAT PARTICULARLY MENTALLY ILL. A ITALIA AGREED TO USE. OUR OF PRESSING ISSUES -- IN OUR STATE AND THEN ALSO IN OUR ORANGE COUNTY AREA I OR SO COME FROM. YOU ARE -- ADDRESSING -- CORRECT ISSUES. WHEN THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS THAT -- NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSING. ON TO A RIGHT THE MEASURES THAT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A BUT THIS BUT THE KILLER NOW FACILITY AT THE FEAR VIEW. HAS BEEN VERY -- A HOTLY DEBATED TELL WHAT IT SHOULD BECOME -- VÃ . ARE AFTER -- INTELLECTUALLY. ARE. DEVELOP DEVELOPMENTALLY CHALLENGED THE POPULATION -- IN WEST THERE AND THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE WHEN THE VAN TO FACILITIES A CLOSE THE WHAT -- HOW THAT THE PUTS FACILITY WOULD BE YOU STOP -- BUT THE A WINDOW WITH THE THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. THAT THE WE AT THE STATE LEVEL OUR TWO HELLO. ARE IN THE DESK IN A THE HOW THE BUILDING SHOULD BE USED. TO FOR WHEN. THERE IS -- A DIRECT OUR COMMUNITY. A STATE. SUCH AS STE THE CITY OF COSTA MESA IS -- A VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ALSO BOARDED THE RECENTLY CAST THAT IDEA -- AND THEN ALSO. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE WORKED WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM THAT DISTRICT. AND WHO SHOULD HAVE A MORE INTERESTED JEAN INTEREST TO IT ON DISAPPOINTED A TOPIC. SO IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN. Y. E. O. IDEA. I MEAN WHICH IS NORMAL -- HOWEVER. CIRCUMVENTING THE LOCAL -- DECISION AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO NAY TO WORK OUT. IN ALL WHATEVER THE BEST USE WHATEVER DECISION THEY WILL IT IT IT IT IS A MADE TO ORDER DEAL FOR THE COULD CALL. I HAVE NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT THE INTERNAL SO WHAT KIND OF A COORDINATION YOU HAVE DONE WITH -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER KADI -- NO WORRIES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. THEY DIDN'T HER INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROCESS. BUT YES I OF A NEW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUDDY PETRIE-NORRIS THE CAMPUS IS HOSTED AND COSTA MESA IT IS A STATE PROPERTY AND AS WE LOOK AT THESE MAJOR ISSUES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. LOOKING REGIONALLY ON I SOLVING ISSUES IS IMPERATIVE AS THIS LAND WAS FORMALLY AND CURRENTLY USED AS A DISABLED HOSPITAL AND THERE WILL BE A CLOSURE AND A AREA TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF THAT WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE LOOKING FOR A TEMPORARY SITE. IN ADDITION TO THAT CAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATRICK. UP WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS UP REGARDING THE SHE HAS A BILL. RELATED TO SURPLUS PROPERTY THERE'S OTHERS THAT ARE INTERESTED SO THESE WILL TAKE MANY CONVERSATIONS I'M COMMITTED. TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS I'M CONTENT. MINTED TO ALSO LOOKING FOR OTHER LOCATIONS THE URGENCY IS NOW -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY PLAN BUT ORANGE COUNTY IN EVERY OTHER COUNTY AND THE STATE TO KILL CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PUT THIS ON THEIR HIGH PRIORITY LIST NEEDS TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DYING ON OUR STREET WHETHER IT'S JUST THE HOMELESS IN IT'S A SCENARIO WHERE SOMEONE IS SICK OR WHETHER THEY'RE SICK AND THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES SO THAT THIS IS NOT -- AGAINST -- THE MEMBER THAT REPRESENTS THAT AREA. IT HAPPENS TO BE IN HER -- COMMUNITY BUT STATE OWNED LAND -- THAT IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO OUR COUNTY IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DISCUSS BUT ANY MY COMMENTS -- I IS A SAID I AM A COMMITTED TO FINDING A SOLUTION AND I KNOW THAT THE SUDDENLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM -- SOUTH COUNTY IS AS WELL SO WE ARE NOT ONLY SPEAK ALMOST REGULARLY ABOUT THIS BUT WE ARE PLANNING ON EVEN MEETING THIS WEEKEND ABOUT IT. SO BUT JUST ENDING THERE IS NO OTHER. ISSUE THAT I THINK RISES TO THE OCCASION THAT WE NEED TO AGREE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION WHEN WETALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. AND THERE IS NO ONE THAT THEY CAN TURN TO THEY ARE ENDING UP IN OUR HOSPITALS THEY ARE ENDING UP IN OUR JAILS OR ARE PARKS AND THIS COSTS OUR STATE AND NORMA'S AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO INVEST IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DIMINISHED IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT HAVE A PLACE. TO TO LIVE OFF HOME AND SO I WILL CONTINUE WORKED WITH THIS I'VE WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THIS AND I ASKED NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR BUT MY COLLEAGUES TO TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THAT WE ARE TOO GOOD OF A COUNTY AND A COUNTRY AND A STATE TO ALLOW THIS RIGHT HERE ON OUR CAPITAL WE SEE PEOPLE LIVING HERE THAT WERE ON THE CAPITAL. IN THIS VICINITY UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. PROBLEMS AND OFTEN WE SEE PEOPLE WALKING BY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND YET WE DO. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S ABOUT THE WILL SO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YEAH AS A FOLLOW UP ON MY I WAS NOT THE QUESTIONING ABOUT THE URGENCY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT THE HOME THIS MUST BE POOR AND ALSO MENTALLY ILL POPULATION AND THEY NEED TO FIND A BETTER. FACILITY SO TO BE HOLLISTER AND THE CARED FOR I'M ON THE RAISING THE QUESTION WHETHER -- WE HAD SOMEONE IS -- ALL OVER THE LOCAL -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COME UP WITH THE OF CONSENSUS BUILDING BECAUSE SOME AMONG MANY AYE DEERS AND THEN ALSO -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A NOTORIOUS SO WHERE DOES SHE SAYS SUPPORTING YOUR IDEAS. BECAUSE AS WE AS A COULD YOU SEE YOU ARE EMPHASIZING THE FACT THAT THIS IS A STATE OWNED A HOWEVER. WE DO HAVE -- OUR JEWISH -- DISTRICT INTERESTED SO I THINK THAT IT'D BE MORE IDEAS TO WORK WITH THAT THE REPRESENT. TATIAN OF THAT DISTRICT. AGAIN I WILL REPEAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI A I HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT -- THE SUDDENLY MEMBER AND I HAVE THE SAME VISION OF WHAT OF FAIR VIEW CAN BE AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOTED THAT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SHE AND I CAN WORK AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO COME TO A SOLUTION. BUT AS FAR AS COURTESY FROM ONE PERSON'S DISTRICT TO ANOTHER -- I CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS LOCATED IN -- DISTRICT BUT I WILL AGAIN SAY AS CAREFULLY AS I CAN THIS IS NOT ABOUT COURTESY IT'S ABOUT URGENCY IN IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE DYING AND IT'S ABOUT. US STANDING BY AND WATCHING THIS AND AND AS COURTEOUS IT AS I CAN BE TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND TO MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SOUTH. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND STAND UP FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OKAY WE CANNOT SEE PEOPLE DIE IN ORDER STREETS. IN AMERICA ANYWHERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI THOSE ARE VERY GOOD COMMENTS AND GOOD QUESTIONS. OF I I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO FOR BEING CREATIVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I THINK WE ALL NEED TO DEAL WITH IT IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IT GOES BEYOND OUR LINES. IT CANNOT JUST BE. OUR LITTLE DISTRICT AND THE GOOD THING AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- PETRIE-NORRIS HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND I AM WELL AWARE OF THAT -- BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS DR CHOI EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ANY OTHER COMMENTS. QUESTIONS [inaudible] VERY GOOD -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SEC A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. FOR THE BILL THAT IS CALLED AB TWELVE NINETY FIVE BUT I CALL IT BILLY'S BILL. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING VERY PERSONAL -- HISTORY RELATED TO THIS I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR CHOICE OF WITNESSES -- YOU HAVE SELECTED A WITNESS WHO COMES FROM MY HOMETOWN OF COLTON. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US REBEKAH GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM THEN WE WILL -- GET. GET THIS BILL MOVING. VERY GOOD -- WE ARE TAKING A SPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS -- ITEM NUMBER ONE I SEE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WICKS HAS ARRIVED. AB. THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HOW. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN ENGLISH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AND STAFF COMMITTEE STOCKS. OF FOOD INSECURITY AMONG HOUSEHOLDS WITH SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN REMAINS HIGH ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FOOD IN SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH DEVELOPMENTAL AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN WHO GROW UP IN FOOD SECURE HOUSEHOLDS OFTEN FALL BEHIND COMPARED TO THEIR FOOD SECURE APPEARS. TO REDUCE CHILD HUNGER THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS PROGRAMS HAS HELPED CHILDREN GAIN ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD AND IS AIMED TO REDUCE FOOD IN SECURITY AND PROMOTE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. WE DO KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK MANY STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT SCHOOL DISTRICT I REPRESENT -- HAVE CHILDREN ON THESE PROGRAMS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IT IN SECURE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING FREE AND REDUCED MALES BUT THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING BENEFITS THROUGH CAL FRESH. WE SEE INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS REPORTS OF FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAS LOWER ENROLLMENT IN FREE REDUCE MEALS. PROGRAMS WITH 51% OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM AND ONLY 24% OF CHILDREN. OF THOSE CHILDREN -- ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA. HIGHER PARTICIPATION ACCESS TO FOOD NUTRITION PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL FOR USHER WOULD HELP PRODUCE FOOD AND SECURITY -- AND POVERTY -- FOR OUR CHILDREN'S VÃ  AND FAMILIES. MY BILL AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WILL DIRECT STATE DEPARTMENTS LOCAL HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO EXAMINE DATA AN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT BENEFITS PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO FIND THE BEST. POSSIBLE SOLUTION AND DEVELOP A STATEWIDE PROCESS THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT. AT THE XCELERATED ROMAN OF CHILDREN INTO CAL FRESH IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT CHILDREN GET THE FOOD THAT THEY NEED. BY EXAMINING THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS WE CAN CREATE A STREAMLINED PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. FACING FOOD AND SECURITY HAVE EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCES EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES. KATHY CENTER LING AND BECKY GERSHON AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SUNDERLAND WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THIS IDEA WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY MULTIPLE COUNTIES DURING OUR INTERNAL LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY SETTING LAST YEAR AND I THINK IN IN PART IT'S DRIVEN BY A BILL THAT WE SPONSORED SEVERAL YEARS AGO BY THEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN SKINNER A BEFORE. TWO IN WHICH SORT OF VOLUNTARY DATA MATCH WITH STRUCTURE BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES AND IT'S SIMPLY TOO COMPLICATED IT'S NOT WORKING OUT AS WELL AS WE HOPE IN THE HASN'T REALLY PRODUCED THE NUMBERS THAT WE EXPECTED. WE KNOW THAT HUNGRY CHILDREN ARE NOT PREPARED TO LEARN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ON THE SCHOOL MUCH LUNCH PROGRAM. BUT WHO ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE BUT NOT A ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S AND THERE HAVE JUST BEEN VARIOUS EFFORTS SORT OF INFORMAL TO PARSE OUT THE PROCESS HE'S ACROSS THE PROGRAMS. AND ALSO ACROSS THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHICH IS SORT OF THE THIRD OP PROGRAM THAT THE BILL NOW BRINGS SAID. ON TO HAVE A REALLY PANNED OUT EITHER BUT THEY'VE ALSO BEEN INFORMAL THERE'S BARRIERS THAT SORT OF THE USING THE DATA ACROSS THE PROGRAMS -- THIS ISN'T AN EASY NOT TO CRACK BUT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE BEING INVOLVED IN SAYING WE WANT YOU TO GET IN A ROOM WE WANT FOLKS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU CRACKED THIS NOT. AND BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE PROGRAMS TO REALLY TRY TO GET THE FOOD TO THE FAMILIES AND HELP CHILDREN BE READY TO LEARN THAT'S OUR GOAL HERE AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. BECKY GOES ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS I'M AS YOU HEARD CAL FRESH IS A REALLY CRITICAL SAFETY NET FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES. WE KNOW THAT WHEN CHILDREN LIVING IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO CAL FRESH DO YOU SEE A REDUCTION IN HEALTHCARE COSTS -- THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP HEART DISEASE AND OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES LATER IN LIFE SO WE KNOW THAT HOW FRESH WORKS AND YET WE SEE A GAP IN CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. I'M SEVERAL FOOD BANKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ON THEIR COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M AS KATHY MENTIONED HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTENT OF AB -- FOR TO TO CONNECT CHILDREN AFFRONT CREAM REDUCED PRICE LUNCH TO CALL FRESH. BUT THE PROCESS FOR ENTERING INTO AMMO USE IN FINDING EFFICIENT WAYS TO STREAMLINE THOUGHT ENROLLMENT PROCESS HAVE BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING AND WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN THE INTENDED RESULTS THAT WE HAD ALL REALLY HOPED FOR TOGETHER. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY DATA AND TECHNICAL ISSUES TO BE WORKED OUT I'M DOES THERE IS NOT A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS WHICH IS WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG. I'M IN SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN A PROCESS TO REALLY PUT ALL THE RIGHT HEADS TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT WAY FOR IT SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST GO BIRTH LOWER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

ITEM NUMBER. THIRTEEN AB TWELVE TWENTY ONE HAVE IS CORRECT [inaudible] VERY GOOD. WHAT COLLEAGUES IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY? I'M HERE 2% A. B. TWELVE TWENTY ONE RELATED. TO CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S. CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S ARE SICK OR CÃ¡C C. A. C. S.. BRING TOGETHER A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS. CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT CHOP PROTECTION MEDICAL PERSONNEL MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO ENSURE THAT IN RESPONSE TO AN ALLEGATION OF CHILD ABUSE. IS COORDINATED AMONG THOSE AGENCIES. AND THAT THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD STAY AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE INVESTIGATION -- WHEN YOU PUT THOSE SORTS OF SERVICES TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE WITH A FOCUS ON THE CHILD'S WELL BEING? THERE IS LESS TRAUMA THERE'S MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROVIDED TO THE CHILD. AND OF WHEN NECESSARY THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING A NEEDED MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAM IS MUCH HIGHER. SO YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND IT'S LESS TRAUMA AND MORE FACTS EMERGE WHICH SUPPORTS WILL BE THOSE CHILDREN. OF THIS IS BEEN IDENTIFIES PREFERRED MODEL FOR THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE AND HEALING FOR CHILD. VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING PRIMARILY A SEX TRAFFICKING. CALIFORNIA HOWEVER DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE A STATUTORY DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER. CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE NO MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THESE SORTS OF FACILITIES. YOU HAVE HERE. ALL LOST WHAT SORRY ABOUT THAT. SHOULD DRAW A BREATH. ARM [inaudible] AND OF THERE'S NO MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CLARITY FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND CHILD WAS DIVESTITURES. AS TO WHAT AND THEN THE CALL IN ITSELF A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER WILL PROVIDE -- THE BILL ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE CARRY BY CHRISTOPHER REQUIREMENTS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ALLEY SU WHO. WHO'S BEEN MY PARTNER BEFORE SHE IS A SURVIVOR. AND COLLEGE STUDENT. IN A VERY ABLE WITNESS AND ALSO ERIN HARPER WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN AFTER SEE CENTERSOF CALIFORNIA. AND CALICO. WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA LISTENING INTERVIEWING COORDINATION CENTER. AND IT SERVES AS ALAMEDA COUNTY CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER SO I INVITE THEM TO JOIN ME NOW. THE FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS ERIN HARPER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CCC AND CALICO WHICH AS YOU JUST HEARD IS THAT SEE SEE FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY. WE SERVE SIX HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED CHILDREN HERE AGES TWO THROUGH SEVENTEEN THREE QUARTERS OF WHOM ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE. CA SEES OUR CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S OUR EVIDENCE BASED TRAUMA INFORMED ORGANIZATIONS THAT BRING TOGETHER EVERY DISCIPLINE TASKED WITH RESPONDING TO INITIAL DISCLOSURE OF ABUSE LET'S LAW ENFORCEMENT CHILD WELFARE PROSECUTION MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AT C. C.'S WE NOT ONLY BRING TOGETHER EACH OF THESE DISCIPLINES BUT WE PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE WHERE CHILDREN CAN RECEIVE. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE NEUTRAL FORENSIC INTERVIEWS WITHOUT A C. C. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR CHILDREN TO BE INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR ABUSE UP TO TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT TIMES BY SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. WITH THE CA SEE THEIR INTERVIEWED ONCE WITH A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OBSERVING FROM ANOTHER ROOM AND THAT INTERVIEW IS RECORDED SO IT CAN BE REFERRED TO BY ANYONE ELSE BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION LATER. HE SEES ARE AND NATIONALLY -- TESTED AND PROVEN MODEL THERE ARE OVER NINE HUNDRED CA SEES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TWENTY TWO ACCREDITED CDCS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH CA SEASON PLACE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL SERVICES THEY DESERVE. FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE REFERRED TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THEY ARE THE CRIMINAL IF IF THEIR CASE GOES TO THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEIR CASE DISPOSITION IS FASTER SO THERE IS A FAST RESULT FROM THE START OF THE CRIMINAL CASE TO THE END OF THE CASE. PARENTS REPORT THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCE LESS TRAUMA WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE INVESTIGATED WHEN OUR CASES ARE INVESTIGATED THROUGH SEAC AND PARENTS REPORT GREATER SATISFACTION WITH THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN CASES ARE INVESTIGATED THROUGH SEAC IN A COORDINATED MANNER THEY COST THE COMMUNITY ON AVERAGE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS PER CASE. THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE BELL IT SETS A MINIMUM FLOOR OF WHAT AN ORGANIZATION CALLING ITSELF A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER SHOULD PROVIDE. THIS GIVES CLEAR TEACH CHILDREN TO FAMILIES TO INVESTIGATORS TO JUDGES TO DOCTORS AS TO WHAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT FROM THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER. SIMILAR TO THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDED. TO ADULT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AS WITH AS RAPE CRISIS CENTERS ARE HAVE A DEFINITION AND A STANDARD IN LEGISLATION OUR CHILDREN DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS. AS I SAID THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL BUT IT'S A GIANT STEP FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE JUSTICE AND HEALING TO ALL OF HIS CHILDREN NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ALLI LOU I'M A NURSING STUDENT AT USF UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE FOUNDER OF A STUDENT GROUP CALLED. PUSHY SEEM TO COMFORT HARZER PATCH. I FOUND A PATCH TO HELP CHILDREN CRISES PARTICULARLY VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE. BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE STUFFED ANIMALS A COMFORT ITEM. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE COLLECTED OVER TWO THOUSAND STUFFED ANIMALS MOST OF WHICH WERE DONATED CALICO CENTER TO GIVE TO THE CHILDREN THEY SERVE. I STARTED PATCH BECAUSE I WAS A VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE AND A FORMER CLIENT OF CALICO. WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED BYA FAMILY FRIEND? AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT HAPPENED TO ME. BUT I KNEW THAT I'D BEEN HURT. I WAS SCARED CONFUSED AND MOST OF ALL I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT IT. AFTER A PARENT SUPPORT THE CASE TO THE POLICE I REMEMBER BEING BROUGHT TO CALICO WHERE I MET WITH THEIR KIND AND CARING STUFF. THE CALIBER TEAM HELP ME FEEL SAFE AND LOVED WHICH ALLOWED ME TO OPEN UP TO THEM ABOUT WHAT HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME. THEY WERE COMFORTING AND ENCOURAGING AS EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO ME AND CONDUCTED THEIR INTERVIEW USING TERMS THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND. EVEN TODAY ELEVEN YEARS LATER I CAN STILL REMEMBER HOW IT FELT SITTING IN THE BIG COMFY CHAIR AND HUGGING MAY TEAL. LARGE STUFFED BUNNY FINDING THE COURAGE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE CALICO INTERFERES. LOOKING BACK NOW I REALIZE HOW FORTUNATE I WAS TO HAVE HAD A CALICO CENTER IN MY COUNTY IF IT WASN'T FOR THEIR TRAIN MULTI DISCIPLINARY RESPONSE TEAM. I WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED MANY TIMES BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES FORCED TO RELIVE EASILY THE WORST. PART OF MY LIFE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HOWEVER MANY VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE ARE NOT AS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS CENTER NEAR THEM TO VISIT. THIS IS WHY CAUCUS MODEL NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED IN EVERY COUNTY OF OUR STATE. EVERY VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED BY BEING FURTHER VICTIMIZED BY THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY BE MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE USE OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY. CHILD ADVOCATES THAT ADVOCACY CENTERS LIKE CALICO. THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU TO PLEASE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TOLD TWENTY ONE THANK YOU.

THIRTEEN OH ONE YES COLLEAGUES SO GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN -- I'M DELIGHTED PERCENT A. B.. THIRTEEN OH ONE THIS FELIZ TO PRIVATE ADOPTION FUNDING. THE PRIVATE AGENCY ADOPTION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PART. SWING A LITTLE -- ACRONYM THEIR PART. WAS CREATED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO HELP INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE ADOPTION FOR CHILDREN WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN IN FOSTER CARE. A CURRENTLY PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCIES ARE REIMBURSED UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHILD. FOR COSTA WOULD OTHERWISE BE REAM UNREIMBURSED WHEN AGENCIES RECRUIT AND FIND A DOCTOR FAMILIES. SOARED CLEARLY SUPPORTS. GETTING KIDS OUT OF FOSTER CARE INTO ADOPTIVE HOUSEHOLDS. AUSTIN'S PARK WAS CREATED IN SEVENTY FOUR WE'VE SEEN MAJOR CHANGES WITH THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM IN CHILD WHERE FOR WELFARE. HARPER JANGLY BUDGET FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. BUT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IT HAS EXCEEDED THAT FUNDING. WHICH COUNTIES HAVE PAID FOR EVEN KNOWS NOT PART OF THEIR REALIGNMENT FUNNY SO COUNTIES HAVE MORE OUTGO THAN THEY HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH FROM THE STATE. THIS BILL IS SEEKING. TO RESTRUCTURE THE PART PROGRAM TO CONTAIN COST TO COUNTIES. WHILE THE SAME TIME PRESERVING THIS MUCH NEEDED FUNDING MECHANISM FOR PRIVATE OPTION AGENCIES. OF WHO DO A CRITICAL WORK A CRITICAL WORK OF FINDING PERMANENT FAMILY PATIENT FOR CHILDREN IN NEED. OF THE BILL COMES WILL TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPENSATION ADOPTION AGENCIES. FOR THE OTHERWISE UNREIMBURSED COSTS. OUR WASHER TO SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THE STATE DOWN THE COUNTY LEVEL [inaudible] OF I WANT TO SAY. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A VERY ROBUST PROCESS WITH THE PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCIES. HOW THIS FINANCIAL WHAT RIDERSHIP IS RESTRUCTURED IS A MATTER OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE? TO THE COUNTIES TO THE PRIVATE OPTION AGENCIES. ROLE TWENTY KIDS IN FOSTER CARE. WHICH IS MY INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT MATTER. AND SO I DO WANT TO SAY I CONSIDER THIS A WORK IN PROGRESS -- TO BUY OWN GRAND KIDS COME OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND IN THIS COUNTY. I CERTAINLY INTEND TO GET RIGHT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT WORK. SO I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CATHY SUNDERLAND'S OF THE COUNTY WILL FOR DRUG SO SHE'S BECAUSE SUPPORT. AND HAVE OTHER ANSWERED PARTIES ARE NOR HERE SO KATHY. THANK YOU FOR SWEETNESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY CENTERING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AS A MISTER COOLEY NOTED NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS A LONG TIME AGO A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THE WORLD AND IN PARTICULAR TO RESET CHANGES THAT HE MENTIONED THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. OF THE BASICALLY THE ENTIRE CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO COUNTIES. AS A PART OF THIS REALIGNMENT THE FUNDING -- FOR PART WAS ACTUALLY REALIGNED COUNTIES BUT THERE WAS REALLY NO MECHANISM FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS OR AMMO USE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES. AND RATHER THAN BECAUSE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION AT THAT TIME EIGHT YEARS AGO WE TEMPORARILY -- CREATED A STRUCTURE WHERE THE STATE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW UPON THE REALIGNMENT RESOURCES AND PAY THOSE CLAIMS. THE IDEA OF THE WAS WE WOULD FIGURE OUT AT SOME POINT HOT IT YOU KNOW SORT OF CHANGE THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTIES. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN HASTENED BY THE OVERAGE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED BUT ALSO THERE'S BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE STATE. TO ENABLE IT TO CONTINUE BILLING THOSE COUNTIES WE HAVE BEEN PAYING THE BILLS SORT OF AS A COURTESY AGAIN ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. AND THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WOULD WE CANNOT CODIFY IT BUT SORT OF MAKE THAT AN ONGOING ISSUE AND WE REALIZE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TRY TO GET LEGISLATION GOING. TO WORK WITH THE ADOPTION AGENCY THEN AFTER PHASE THAT ACT AS AGENCIES TO PRESERVE THE PART PROGRAM BUT MOVE FORWARD TO GET THAT DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THAT WERE THE ONES AUTHORIZING IT -- WE HOPE AS PART OF THE PLACEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ALREADY EXIST WE'RE NOT ASKING THESE AGENCIES TO ENTER INTO INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS OF THE COUNTIES THAT OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE UNWIELDY. BUT WE THINK THAT WE CAN DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS NOT AND WE'LL BE THAT IT PRESERVES PARK. AND ALSO -- ADDRESSES ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S COME UP WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM BIG ACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S LEGISLATION WHAT THAT DID WAS GO STATEWIDE WITH WHAT'S CALLED THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT MOVES A LOT OF THE ADOPTION WORK. UP FRONT AND COUNTIES ARE DOING THAT AS PART OF OUR APPROVAL OF THOSE RESOURCE FAMILY. THINGS LIKE A AN ADOPTION HOME STUDY ARE NOW DONE AS PART OF THAT PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT THAT THE COUNTIES DO ALREADY AS PART OF OUR FAA. SO WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TIME IS THAT THAT WORK WON'T NEED TO BE DONE AS MUCH BY THE PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCIES AN EFFORT FACED. AND THIS COULD END UP WELL WE'VE SEEN OVER JUST FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ACTUALLY THING UNDER SPENDING AND THOSE FUNDS BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TIED UP THERE AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE THERE FOR THAT PART PROGRAM AND THAT'S IT. PARK ONLY HAS CERTAIN USES AND ITS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO ADOPTIONS SO ALSO WITH THE BILL WHAT DO YOU AND MOVING THE FUNDS TO THE COUNTIES WOULD ALLOW US TO USE THAT -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THESE AGENCIES WE VALUE VERY MUCH TO DO OTHER PLACEMENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES GUARDIANSHIP SUPPORT ON IT COULD BE PRE PRE OR POST PERMANENCY. TRYING TO MAINTAIN AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY OR MAINTAIN A GUARDIANSHIP WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FREE UP THOSE FUND SHOULD THAT UNDER SPENDING OCCUR LIKE WE THINK IT COULD BUT HAVEN'T YET SEEN. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- WE'VE TRIED VERY STRONGLY TO ADDRESS AT LEAST AS MANY AS WE COULD OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE ADVOCATES -- AND THE AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE ALLIANCE WHO I THINK WILL PROBABLY HEAR FROM AND ARE VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WE DON'T WANT TO PLOT THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THESE AGENCIES. WE JUST THINK REALIGNMENT HAPPENED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WE IT IS TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT KEEP IT WORKING AND EXPAND ITS USE OF POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AGAIN JEFF TORTILLA JUST PRIVATE ADVOCATE TENDS TO CONCERNED IN PLEASE SOMETHING THAT HELPS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKS. BIG DIFFERENCE FROM [inaudible] NINETEEN SEVENTY THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS CONCERN MOSTLY SUPPORT CAN CONCERN IS THIS THE RIGHT HOLE FOR GREAT ABSOLUTELY. OF MADAM CHAIR HEY IT SEEMS TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR GAIL JHONSON VON. AN INDEPENDENT PERMANENCY ADVOCATES UP WORKING OVER THE LAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO PREVENT OUR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE FROM ACHIEVING AND SUSTAINING PERMANENT FAMILIES. I SUPPORT THE BILL. AS IF THE INTENTIONS OF THE BILL BUT MY CONCERN. IS AROUND HOW IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PARK STATUTE CURRENTLY HAS. MY SMALL AGENCY WHERE I WAS PREVIOUSLY. LOS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY CHILD WE PLACED FOR ADOPTION. THE YEAR PREVIOUS YEAR WE HAD PLACED TWO HUNDRED HARD TO PLACE CHILDREN INTO ADOPTED FAMILIES NOT TWO HUNDRED TIMES FIVE THOUSAND IS A MILLION DOLLAR LOSS. AS WE WATCH AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE RELINQUISHING THEIR ADOPTION LICENSES BECAUSE OF THIS WE OURSELVES SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED SHOULD WE STOP PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN LEGISLATION MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO CONTINUE AND IN FACT. FOLLOWING AT THE NUMBER OF F. F. A.'S THAT. ACHIEVEMENT ADOPTION LICENSES INCREASED BY 77% LEADING TO A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN EXITING FOSTER CARE TO ADOPTION. I KNOW THAT. THIRTEEN AB THIRTEEN A ONE IS WELL INTENTIONS AND I HAVE GREAT ESTEEM FOR THE PEOPLE SITTING AT THIS TABLE WE ARE COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BACK. BUT I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE REMOVING OF THE CLARITY OF THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION ADOPTION AGENCY CAN RECEIVE FOR THEIR DOCUMENTED UNREIMBURSED COSTS ARE NONPROFIT AGENCIES SIMPLY CAN'T CONTINUE THIS WORK WITH A BUSINESS MODEL THAT REQUIRES THEM. TO DO WORK AT A LOSS. AGENCIES ALL AROUND THE STATE RIGHT NOW ARE CONSIDERING. CLOSING THEIR ADOPTION PROGRAMS IF AB. THIRTEEN OH ONE IT ENDS UP REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE UNDER. THAT UNDER PAR. THE TO TAKE THESE CHILDREN REALLY MATTER AND I URGE YOU AND THEY IF THEY'RE WITH US I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER REMOVING THE AMENDMENT. THAT DELETES THE CURRENT LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAN THE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION THAT CAN BE RECEIVED FOR THESE UNREIMBURSED COST I HAVE GREAT GRATITUDE TO MR COOLEY AND HIS STAFF. THEIR CONTINUED WORK TO OPEN THE PATHWAYS TO PERMANENCY FOR THESE CHILDREN SO THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE THEIR THEIR POTENTIAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING. AN TO SEEN AMENDMENTS THAT CAN ALLOW ME TO HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT BEHIND THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER WITNESSES. IN BETWEEN OR IN OPPOSITION SHARE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRIS STONER MERTZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES -- WHEN WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED AND FORTY NATIONALLY ACCREDITED NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS? INCLUDING FIFTEEN NON PROFIT PRIVATE FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE DOES NOT OF AN OFFICIAL OPPOSE POSITION BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN SO FAR AND WE ARE HAVING A ROBUST CONVERSATION. AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT -- ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR OF HIS STAFF AND SEE WGA THE SPONSOR. AB THIRTEEN OH ONE SIX TO CHANGE AND ELIMINATE THE ADOPTION REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR A SUCCESSFUL FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROGRAM WITHOUT CREATING A NEW RATE STRUCTURE. AS BACKGROUND OVER SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN ARE ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR AND THREE QUARTERS OF ALL ADOPTIONS FINALIZED IN CALIFORNIA ARE FROM FOSTER CARE. THAT IS AN AMAZING STORY ABOUT THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA FINDING PERMANENCY FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING. IS DONE TOO QUICKLY THAT WILL HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LOWERING NOT THAT HIGH SUCCESS RATE. AMONG CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTIVE CHILDREN. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE PERCENTAGE OF FOSTER YOUTH TO EXIT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM TO ADOPTION HAS INCREASED 24%. AND 25% OF ADOPTIONS FROM FOSTER CARE ARE RECRUITED IN PLACE BY PRIVATE NONPROFIT FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES OR FFA IS. AN ADOPTION AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL THAT ELIMINATES THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF DISRUPTING THE SUCCESS OF PART. PURPOSE THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCE FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT ADOPTION AGENCIES AND IS ALSO THE ONLY PERFORMANCE BASED OUT COME PROGRAM IN OUR STATE'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WHEREBY THE PAYMENT TO THE NONPROFIT ADOPTION AGENCY. FOR THEIR OTHERWISE UNREIMBURSED COSTS. ONLY COMES AFTER AN ADOPTION PLACEMENT AGREEMENT IS SIGNED AND THEN. THE SECOND HALF AFTER FINALIZATION OF THAT ADOPTION WE HAVE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS THE BILL NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT A COUNTY PLACES A FOSTER CHILD. THAT WHEN IT COUNTY PLACES A FOSTER CHILD WITH A FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY A DULY AS A DULY LICENSED FFA AN ADOPTION AGENCY THAT AGENCY SHOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR OTHERWISE ON REIMBURSE COSTS. AND THEN SECONDLY THERE NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENT DATA AND TIME GIVEN TO RECONSTRUCTING THE PART PROGRAM. TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS OF A CHEERING TIMELY AND QUALITY PERMANENCY FOR CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM. AGAIN WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THUS FAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION. TO GET TO A A GOOD PLACE FOR THAT WILL WORK FOR ALL OF US IN MOSTLY FOR THE KIDS. THANKS THANK YOU. HI. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JILL JACOBSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FAMILY BUILDERS BY ADOPTION WE'RE BASED IN OAKLAND WE SERVE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA -- I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL ALSO -- WE'VE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH CW DA FOR MANY YEARS AND I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND ASSEMBLY MAN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN DOING THAT. MY CONCERN IS FOR THE CHILDREN -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE BURDENS THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE. IS WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A BIT MORE INNOVATIVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RECRUIT AND PREPARE FAMILIES TO MEET THE VERY SPECIAL NEEDS OF MANY OF THE CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES LARGE SIBLING GROUPS OF CHILDREN AND I MEAN THREE STEPS FOR SIPS FIVE SIPS AND FOR SOME REASON IN LA COUNTY EIGHT SIBLING GROUPS THE EIGHTH KIDDOS AND ONE SIBLING GROUP -- IT'S MY HOME CITY I DON'T KNOW WHY WE GROW THEM SO BIG THERE BUT WE DO. SIBLING GROUPS ALSO -- LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER CHILDREN AREN'T REPRESENT 20% OF THE POPULATION OF OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS WE WERE ALSO THE FIRST ORGANIZATIONS TO WELCOME LESBIAN AND GAY FAMILIES INTO. OF THE FOLD AS PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE ANNA UP IN FOSTER PARENTS AND THEY NOW REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CARE GIVERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BOTH IN PUBLIC AND AND PRIVATE AGENCIES WE'VE HAD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO HAVE THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE HAD WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT. AND THE CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER ARE THE OLDER CHILDREN BECAUSE THOSE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE CHALLENGES AND GET STUCK IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SO CHILDREN OVER AGE NINE TEN AND OP BUT PARTICULARLY TEENAGERS SIBLING GROUPS ARE GOING TO BE BROKEN UP KIDS ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO STAY WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. MOST OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR THEIR BLACK AND BROWN. AND THEIR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS DEVELOPMENTALLY LEARNING WISE AND PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY IN MENTAL HEALTH WISE AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CHILDREN DON'T BECOME OUR NEXT GENERATION OF HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN BETWEEN OR IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAREN ALFORT IN THE C. E. O. FOR LILY PUT FAMILIES OUR WE'RE A STATEWIDE ADOPTION AGENCY AND HAVE DONE NEARLY TEN THOUSAND ADOPTIONS FROM FOSTER CARE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY WHEN WE A I APPRECIATE -- BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR FOR THE RECEPTIVENESS TO WORKING THROUGH -- THE CONCERNS THAT WE EXPRESSED WITH THE INITIAL LANGUAGE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT DIALOGUE AND AND I'M AND I BELIEVE THAT ARE HARD AT ALL WITH. WE WANT OUR CHILDREN NOT TO GROW UP IN FOSTER CARE NOT TO BE PART OF A SYSTEM A PART OF A FAMILY SITE THANK YOU FOR ON THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND LOOK FORWARD -- TO I HOPE GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE I COULD STAND CONFIDENTLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU -- HI MY NAME IS GORDON RICHARDS AND I'M WITH A PROFOUNDLY SERVICES I WON'T REPEAT THE THE WORK THE CHRIS AND CAROLINE OTHERS HAVE DONE. OF JUST SAY I HAVE CONCERNS AND AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ALLIANCE [inaudible] THANK YOU.

WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON A DIFFICULT ISSUE AND I HOPE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO ON INTENSIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SURELY OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE. ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF YOUR GOALS -- I JUST -- CAN'T LET THE OPPORTUNITY GO BY TO SAY THAT -- MY HOPE THAT THE COUNTIES -- CONTINUE TO WORK ON REMOVING BARRIERS THAT KEEP PEOPLE. I'M OUT OF THE ADOPTION PROCESS -- YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM IS -- VERY UNFRIENDLY TO ADOPTIVE PARENTS. AND YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT THE COUNTIES RESENTMENT THERE ARE ANTI ADOPTION BIASES AND WORK ON THE PARENTS SIDE AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN. I THINK THE COMMENTS IT WHAT WHAT I APPRECIATED IS THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE WHO SAID I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THERE WERE CONCERNS AND EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'VE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU MISTER COOLEY AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AS MS FRIEDMAN HAS INDICATED WE DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THOSE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND TO THE THE PRIVATE ADOPTION -- AGENCIES WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BE ABLE. TO TO BE PART OF THE SPACE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE INCLUDED SO WITH THAT. WE HAVE -- A FIRST OF MOTION BY MS RIVAS SECOND BY MISS FRIEDMAN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK. WHEN I THINK OF THIS BILL I THINK OF A SERMON HER LONG TIME AGO? THE TITLE OF WHICH WAS THE SEVEN LAST WORDS OF THE CHURCH. AND I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF WHAT THE HECK OF THE SURPLUS WERE TO THE CHURCH. TURNED OUT THEY WERE WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THIS WAY BEFORE. I THINK ANY SORT OF ORGANIZATIONS VITAL NEEDS TO BE LOOKING AT INNOVATIONS WERE ACTUALLY APPRECIATED THAT. PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GROUND BREAKING INNOVATION THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND I ACTUALLY FEEL THIS BILL IS SIMPLY A PART OF THAT. EFFORT AND INNOVATION WE'RE UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE. ALL I AM LOOKING TO SUPPORT THE COUNTIES BRAG SAID TOOK SYDNEY TO THE MIDWEST LAST WEEK. AND THE ONE PIECE OF HOME LIFE TO FOLLOW US WHERE WE GO WAS A YOUNG COUPLE WE KNEW. THEY WERE GOING TO A COUNTY ADOPTION PROCESS IN GOING. TO COURT PROCESS WITH GREAT ANXIETY THAT WE ARE KEEPING TABS ON SO I SORT OF APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE -- FROM MY COLLEAGUE SO. I'M JUST PLEASED TO BRING THIS BILL I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PARTIES. AND BE ASSURED BY FOCUSES UPON HOW TO MAKE THESE RESOURCES. THAT WE COMMIT ON WHATEVER FRONT. OF HAVE A LASTING POSITIVE IMPACT THE LIVES OF KIDS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD TECH WORLD PLEASE.

SEVEN TWENTY ONE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD START BY THINKING AT THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS BILL. AND ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED. LAST YEAR THE LIVING CHILDREN FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE SUBMITTED THE REPORT ON STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO END DEEP. CHILD POVERTY IN REDUCE OVERALL CHILD POVERTY BY 50% AND OUR STATE. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL DO JUST THAT BY ESTABLISHING A GRANT PROGRAM TO FIND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION -- PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IN ONE REPORT 99% OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OFFICIALS STATED. THAT THEY WANTED TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT SERVICES BUT ONLY ONE THIRD SAID THEY WERE LIKELY TO EXPAND THOSE SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. SO TO ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE MORE I HAVE A WITNESS THAT ALLOWED TO SELF INTRODUCE WITNESS. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS JACKIE TO WHOM LONG I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT POLICY AND HAVE A SEAT AT THE GRACE INSTITUTE -- ON PROVIDING TEST MONEY ON BEHALF OF CON MAKE COLLEGE WHO IS THE CO CHAIR OF WHAT THE CULTURE OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE SO -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF -- AND CHAIR ON ON MAKING VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND REALLY APPRECIATE ON THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MAKING THIS A A MORE IMPROVED AND BETTER BILL. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE LEGISLATIVE CHARGE OF THE CHILD PARTY TASK FORCE WAS DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE BASED PLAN TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S. HIGHEST IN THE NATION LEVEL OF CHILD AND FAMILY PARTY FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES THE TASK FORCE FURTHER DELINEATED THIS GOAL AS A LIMITING DEEP CHILDHOOD POVERTY AND REDUCING OVERALL CHILD APART IN CALIFORNIA. BUT LEAST 50% OVER THE NEXT TEN TO TWENTY YEARS. TO HELP ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT -- WE DIVIDE THE TASK FORCE INTO SUBCOMMITTEES. INCLUDING A SOCIAL SAFETY NET EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS EDUCATION WORKFORCE AND TRAINING SPECIAL SPECIAL POPULATIONS ACCORDED SERVICES.

THEY ALSO CONSIDERED OVERARCHING ISSUES LIKE THE PREDICTABILITY OF OURS AND SHIFTS TO AND THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION AND THE DIGITAL AND SERVICE ECONOMIES. THE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIR AND SUBCOMMITTEE STRONGLY EMPHASIZE THAT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT COULD BE DONE IN THE WORK FORCE AND TRAINING AREA WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION. AND COMPLETION WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS BY LOW INCOME PARTICIPANTS BY FUNDING SERVICES LIKE CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS TO THE STATE SAFETY NET AND SOCIAL SERVICES. PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AS THE NOW SAYS AND THE RESEARCH POINTS IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPACTFUL FOR WOMEN WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AND WE KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY CLOSE 270% OF THEM HAVE CHILDREN. UNDER -- UNDER THE AGES OF SIX THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT FOR TRAINING AND JOB TRAINING. PROGRAMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TRAINEES NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET TO AND FROM WORK HAVE RELIABLE CHILDCARE AND HOUSING SECURITY THE SUBCOMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THE SEPARATE FUND. BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE AS A PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION.

AND WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- BOTH THOSE WHO. RUN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WILL. I BELIEVE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CONSENSUS BELL. A CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY PROVIDE INDEPENDENT LIVING. ASSISTED LIVING AND SKILLED NURSING HOME AND OPTIONS SO THAT SENIORS MAY MOVE FORWARD BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE. TO HIGH LEVELS OF CARE WITHOUT LEAVING THE COMMUNITY. TO SECURE THIS PEACE OF MIND RESIDENTS PAY AN ENTRANCE FEE IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AS WELL AS AN ON GOING MONTHLY FEE I SHOULD KNOW I LIVE IN ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES I'M THE YOUNG GUY -- AND ONCE YOU PAY THAT ENTRANCE FEE YOU REALLY ARE STOCK. IF THERE'S A FINANCIAL PROBLEM. AND THIS BILL -- JUST DEALS WITH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE ARE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS -- THESE ARE OFTEN VERY. I'LL SPEAK FOR MY OWN COMMUNITY HIGHLY HIGHLY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. THEY REALLY CAN. UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND AND IN ANY WAY THEY CAN HELP. SO ABC. THIRTEEN SEVENTY NINE WOULD INCREASE THE FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY OF CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES.

HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS MARGARET GRIFFITH -- PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUING CARE RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. I MARKET DRIVEN PRESIDENT CAL CROW CALIFORNIA CONTINUING CARE RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION AND A RESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. A C. C. R. C. IN DAVIS. ALSO ONE OF THE ON ONCE. MY HUSBAND AND I MOVED TO OUR C. C. R. C. FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I'VE BEEN ON THE CALPERS BOARD SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND PRESIDENT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN C. C. R. C. PROVIDERS PROMISED BENEFITS. FOR UP FRONT DEPOSITS AND PERIODIC PAYMENTS MADE BY RESIDENTS. AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AS OUR AUTHOR STATED WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THE CONTINUING CARE BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF C. C. R. C. PROVIDERS. THIS OVERSIGHT IS PRIMARILY CONDUCTED. THROUGH REVIEW OF THE PROVIDERS ANNUAL REPORTS WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DATA. SHOULD DSS SEE INDICATIONS OF C. C. R. C. MAY BE IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. THE BRANCH MAY REQUIRE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY NINE WOULD ESTABLISH SPECIFIC CRITERIA THE BRANCH COULD USE IN ANALYZING A PROVIDERS CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION. AND IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT ANY RESULTING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND RELATED PROGRESS REPORTS. BE SHARED WITH THE RESIDENTS COUNCIL OF THE C. C. R. C.. UNLIKELY PERSPECTIVE RESIDENTS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIVE THIRTY SIX EXTENDS THE AGE OF ONSET THE DEFINITION FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD. TWENTY TWO YEARS OF AGE SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN REAL LIFE TERMS. UNDER CURRENT LAW ANYONE WHO OBTAINS A DEVELOPMENTAL DISS DISABILITY AFTER AGE EIGHTEEN IS PRECLUDED. FROM UTILIZATION UTILIZING THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THOSE YOUNG ADULTS TO BENEFIT IMPROVE FROM THOSE. VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES. THERE'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THOSE WHO DO RECEIVE THESE SERVICES BENEFIT GREATLY FROM. THEM. WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH QUALITY OF LIFE AND FUNCTIONALITY. THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT THE BRAIN CONTINUES DEVELOPMENT UNTIL AT LEAST TWENTY TO MINE STILL IS. AND HAS ONE MADE IT CLEAR THAT A PERSON'S BRAIN. HAS NOT COMPLETED ITS GROWTH OVER DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO AT LEAST INITIALLY. AT LEAST INITIALLY THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE DROPPED THE BROADER AGE RANGE IN THEIR DEFINITIONS OF DEVOUT ONE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELIGIBILITY. THRESHOLD TO MATCH FEDERAL STANDARDS THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. SCIENTIFIC DATA. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN THE LEADER TO CHAMPION EFFORTS TO INCREASE AND ENHANCE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH. LIVING WITH ID DE. AND THIS CHANGE IN LAW WOULD HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF THE STRUGGLING YOUNG DISABLED CALIFORNIA. WHO NEED OUR HELP?

AND WE'VE YET TO DO IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE TACKLE AS A LEGISLATURE WHEN IT COMES -- TO JUVENILE JUSTICE SOCIAL JUSTICE WE'VE CHANGED A LOT OF THE LAS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE BRAIN HASN'T YET BEEN DEVELOPED AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE YET WE DON'T DO IT HERE. THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME TO ME AT A YOUNG MAN IN MY DISTRICT SIX WEEKS AFTER HE TURNED EIGHTEEN HE WAS T. BONED BY TRUCK -- DRUNK DRIVER IN SUFFERED TRAN -- TRAUMA TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES NOW HE'S FORTUNATE HIS FATHER'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL SCREENWRITER.

TO ADVOCATE FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CONGRESS CHANGED THE DEFINITION DEVELOPMENTS DISABILITY FROM USING A SPECIFIC LIST OF CONDITIONS TO A MORE GENERALIZED APPROACH FOCUSED ON FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE THE DISABILITY FOR LIFE AND BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. AT THE SAME TIME AS WAS ALREADY STATED CONGRESS CHANGED THE AGE OF ONSET REQUIRED TO HAVE A DEVELOPMENT TO DISABILITY FROM. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO STE THERE'S EVEN SOME STUDIES THAT HAVE RECENTLY FOUND THAT BRING DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T OCCUR UNTIL THE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE ARE STILL DEVELOPING THEIR BRAINS -- IN A DEVELOPMENT AS BILLY CAN OCCUR AS A RESULT OF AN INJURY AND ILLNESS OR GENETIC CONDITION. FOR EXAMPLE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN ACQUIRE A BRAIN INJURY FROM A STROKE OR NEAR DROWNING. A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY FROM A SPORTS INJURY OR ACCIDENT. OR GENETIC OR THE HEALTH CONDITION THAT DOESN'T DEVELOP UNTIL LATER IN LIFE. ENSURING THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SUCH AS THOSE AVAILABLE IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS IS CRITICAL. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE REQUIRED THE DISABILITY AND AND LATER IN LIFE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LEARN HOW TO THEY'RE GOING TO ADJUST TO LIFE WITH A SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY PROBABLY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR LIFE. THE COUNCIL BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE STATUTORY CHANGE DEFINITION TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE STATE DEFINITION WITH THE FEDERAL DEFINITION.

CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THE SERVICES OF SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. I THINK THAT WE CAN GO TO THE AUDIT THAT WAS PERFORMED RECENTLY BY THE STATE OR ON THE ON THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WELL AND BETTER. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT TRYING BUT I THINK THAT THERE WE GET IN RUTS AND I THINK THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE FROM THE OUTSIDE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE. A BETTER PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER -- WE ALSO WILL LOOK AT WHEN WE DID SB ONE THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT I'M SO PROUD OF WE ALSO HAD AN INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CALTRANS.

FOR DISABILITIES VOICES UNITED WHO HAVE BEEN AT MANY OF OUR MEETINGS AND MANY OF OUR ADVOCACY COMPONENTS PLEASE WONDERFUL FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NATALIE COOPER I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF FAMILIES. FOR EARLY AUTISM TREATMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT ONE TWO FEET WAS FOUNDED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND A SERVE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES FREE OF CHARGE OF PROVIDING EDUCATION ADVOCACY AND INTERVENTION SUPPORT. IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT OF A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD I HAVE BEEN. REQUIRED TO STRONGLY ADVOCATE YEAR AFTER YEAR TO EXCESS SEVERAL ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THESE HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PAINFUL EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOAN THE VERY LARGE AGENCY TRYING TO SECURE THE SERVICES MY FOR HONORABLE SET NEEDED. AT THE SAME TIME CARING FOR HIS INTENSIVE NEEDS. AB EIGHT ONE TWO WAS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES RECEIVE THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITH IN THIS A VERY COMPLEX DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SYSTEM AND OF SERVICES. THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS AUTHORIZED BY THAT LETTERMAN ACTS DO NOT OPERATE UNIFORMLY NOR WITH TRANSPARENCY. FOR INSTANCE WHY IS IT THAT SOME FAMILIES ARE OFFERED RESPITE WITH MAXIMAL HOURS WELL OTHER FAMILIES. ARE CHALLENGED AND OFFER WITH CHALLENGES ARE OFFERED LITTLE TO NONE. WHY DOES IT TAKE DUE PROCESS HEARINGS TOP THE SAME ISSUE THAT WAS DECIDED BY A JUDGE IN THE FAVOR OF THE CONSUMER LAST CALENDAR YEAR [inaudible] PROVIDE. TO GET A PROVIDED IN THE NEXT CALENDAR YEAR WHY SO OFTEN WHEN FAMILIES ARE IN CRISIS AND TURN TO THE VERY AGENCY THAT EXISTS AND IS FUNDED TO HELP THEM. ARE LEFT UNSUPPORTED AND FEELING EVEN MORE DISCOURAGED. WE BELIEVE THAT INSPECTOR GENERAL WITH EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON THE REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICES AND WOULD BRING ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE OPERATION SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THE WORKER PROPOSED AN AB EIGHT TWELVE WILL MOVE THE CAN. CONVERSATION FOR AND AND SHOW THAT FOR TOO LONG. WAY TOO LONG REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND NO REAL TRANSPARENCY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS ALLISON RANTS ON THE MOTHER OF A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY SIR BY SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER AND ALSO A LAW PROFESSOR AT STANFORD -- BUT I'M HERE TODAY AS A BOARD MEMBER OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED -- O DO TWO THINGS FIRST I WANT TO CONVEY THE SCOPE OF THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEM. AS WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY. RIDLEY THAT WE'RE FACING SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED A BILL OF THIS KIND AND SECONDLY I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY WE THINK AB EIGHT TWELVE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO SO THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DDS AND THE TWENTY ONE PRIVATE NON PROFIT SAID OVERSEAS WHICH IS UNIQUE IN THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO OTHER STATE THAT HAS THIS COMPLICATED CONFIGURATION. MAKES ACCOUNTABILITY PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND THE WAY THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS UNFOLDED OVER THE PAST HALF CENTURY HAS LEAD TO CHRONIC AN OFTEN QUITE DRAMATIC AS WE'VE HEARD SHORTFALLS IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS NO SECRET BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE SHORTFALLS IN REPORTS THAT STRETCH BACK FOR DECADES AS EARLY AS NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE STATE AUDITOR -- ISSUED A REPORT HIGHLIGHTING THE FAILURE OF THE DEPARTMENT TO HOLD REGIONAL CENTERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR DISPARITIES ACROSS REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE RECEIPT OF SERVICES A COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED BY DIFFERENCES AND THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE. AS RECENTLY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE STATE COMPTROLLER TOUCH AND VERY SIMILAR THEMES IN ITS EVALUATION OF DD **** ON THE REGIONAL CENTERS USE OF STATE FUNDS -- WITH REGARD TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND AUDITING STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL CONTROLS OR LACK THERE OF IN RESPONSE TO WITH THE BLUR COMPLAINTS. BUT YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN IN PRACTICE FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WELL FIRST OF ALL -- IT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SELF DETERMINATION LAW WITH WHICH IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. AFTER A LONG SERIES OF DELAYS AS I SEE HERE TODAY STILL HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IT MEANS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPENT THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. ON IN ORDER TO COMBAT ONGOING RACIAL AND ETHNIC INEQUALITIES IN OUR SYSTEM AND OVERTHE PAST THREE YEARS. THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITES AND LATINOS THE TWO LARGEST GROUP SERVE BY THE SYSTEM HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN BIGGER RATHER THAN SMALLER AFTER THE EXPENDITURES OF OF THOSE THAT THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. ON THE SHORTFALL IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET BUILT A SAFETY NET TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING HELP THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT. SO NOW THAT I'VE BRIEFLY ALLUDED TO THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING. THERE'S TWO SIMPLE REASONS WHY WE FEEL THAT AB EIGHT TWELVE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO FIRST IT TRIES TO PUT THE GOAL OF OF ADDRESSING SHORTFALLS IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FRONT AND CENTER. SECONDLY IT BRINGS TOGETHER A NUMBER OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS. DDS REGIONAL CENTERS DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL STATE HONOR AND STATE CONTROLLER TO DISCUSS THE SCOPE OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEM AND MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO FIX IT. NOW WE'D TV YOU DO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL AND MAKE IT STRONGER. THAT WE VERY MUCH HOPE THE THE AUTHOR CONSIDER BUT TO SUM UP WE COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER -- ON THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING SHORTFALL IN THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OUR SYSTEM AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR HIM FOR TAKING SUCH STRONG LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS SO BADLY NEEDED. WE THINK THAT AB EIGHT TWELVE IS A CRITICAL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS -- TO FLUSH IT OUT AND STRENGTHEN IT WHILE HELPING TO PUSH IT FORWARD THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARILYN LAMBIE AGAIN WITH GENESIS A CAMELLIA OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE IN SUPPORT AS LONG AS THE WORKING GROUP INCLUDES SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS OR AT IS AT LEAST SPANISH SPEAKING ABOUT IS JUST SOMETHING IS. THESE GROUPS LEAN WHITE OFTEN AT THE TOP AND WE JUST THINK THAT THAT IS A REALLY BIG LIKE GLARING HOLE IN THE WAY THAT THE SERVICES ARE GIVE IT. VENTURE MEMBERS CARLIN AND AGAIN HERE ABOUT THAT LINE SUPPORTING PEOPLE BY DD IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY CARRYING -- YOU KNOW CARING FOR A CHILD -- AND SOMETIMES I THINK PEOPLE -- INFAMOUS I'M A SINGLE DAD AND THERE'S A LOT OF INSENSITIVITY TO WHAT THAT ENTAILS IN TERMS OF EVEN OUR ASSEMBLY SCHEDULE OFTENTIMES -- HOW HARD IT IS TO TRY TO NAVIGATE DRIVING ANALYSTS AT SO SO I EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF THE CARE FOR CHAU? PLUS ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY THRUST UPON YOU AND THE FRUSTRATION THAT I KNOW YOU OFTENTIMES GO THROUGH SO I THINK THIS IS. A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- AND AGAIN MR FRAZIER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONTINUING TO BE THE VOICE IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. THE MANAGER. OF THIS FRAZIER.

CARLY SINGLE WITH THE FOOD BANK OF CONTRA COSTA AND SOMEONE WHO IS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I'LL JUST SHARE THAT -- WE DID -- HUNGER STUDY LAST YEAR WE SURVEYED HUNDREDS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE RECIPIENTS ACROSS OUR TWO COUNTIES AND FOUND THAT. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE THAT ARE OF WORKING AGE AND ABLE TO WORK ARE WORKING BUT A THIRD OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING LESS THAN TWENTY HOURS A WEEK AND WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THESE TIME LIMITS UNDER THIS RULE. AND THEN AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WORK THE MAJORITY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR OVER THREE MONTHS AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THAT THIS IS A REALLY VULNERABLE. POPULATION AND THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE RECEIVING CAO FRESH FOOD ASSISTANCE AND STILL NEEDING TO COME TO OUR FOOD BANK DISTRIBUTIONS AND IT'S ONLY THE TWO PROGRAMS IN COMBINATION THE HELP MAKE ENDS MEET.

THAT'S A FORMAL A FORMERLY HOMELESS PERSON WHO ONLY MADE IT OUT OF THE SHELTER BY WORKING. BY FINDING A JOB I UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF WORK -- AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE THOSE ROOF -- THIS BILL REFLECTS MY VALUES HOWEVER. I WAS ABLE TO FIND WORK. ONLY WITH THE HELP OF CALIFORNIA. SIMPLY PUT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY NEXT MEAL WAS COMING FROM. AND I WE KNOW THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME -- I WAS FREE TO CONCENTRATE ON DOING THAT. I REJECT THE ENTIRE CONCEPT IF THEY BALK AT ANYWAY. IT'S MEANT AS A SLUR THAT. DEMONIZED AS THE POOR. TO QUOTE FROM AN EXTERNAL AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE. IN THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLED. WHO'S ABLE BODIED ANYWAY. I'D LIKE TO QUOTE FROM THIS. ABLE BODIED IS NOT TRULY. A DEMOGRAPHIC LABEL. THERE IS NO STANDARD FOR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABILITY. MAKES A PERSON ABLE. RATHER. THE TERM HAS LONG BEEN USED. AS A POLITICAL. THE ABLE BODIED COULD WORK. BUT ARE NOT WORKING. OR NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH. AND THEREFORE DON'T DESERVE OUR HELP. THE BARRIERS TO FINDING WORK. FOR THIS POPULATION ARE REAL. EVERYBODY I KNOW IN THE SAFETY NET. CAN WORK. IS WORKING. WORK RULES AND TIME LIMITS. ARE ALSO INSIDIOUS. BECAUSE ALL THEY DO. PLEASE MAKE A PERSON WHO IS ALREADY. IN A STATE OF PANIC. RUN OUT AND GET THE QUICKEST EASIEST GIG THEY CAN GET. IN ORDER TO JUST STAY ON THE PROGRAM. AND MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE COMPLAINTS. WALMART IS THE BIGGEST REDEEMER OF FOOD STAMPS. UNDER THE CURRENT. RECENTLY PROPOSED SNAP CUTS. THEY STAND TO LOSE. FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. AND THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST. IN MAKING SURE PEOPLE STAY. ON THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM. THIS IS REFLECTED. IN THE JOBS THAT THEY OFFER. WHEN I MADE IT OUT OF HOMELESSNESS I WAS FORTUNATE? THE JOB I FOUND PAID A LIVING WAGE I WAS OFF SNAP AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE. I ENVISION A TIME WHEN PROGRAMS IN JOB TRAINING. MOVE PEOPLE OFF OF SERVICES AND AWAY FROM BEING THE WORKING POOR. THAT'S WHY SUPPORT TEN TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S MY HOPE FOR THE CARROT PROGRAM. THE JOBS ARE. THAT THE JOBS BE. SUSTAINABLE JOBS GOOD JOBS. LIVING WAGE JOBS.

FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY -- TO THIS TO THE AUTHOR OF NUMBER WICKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE US AND I CAME IN OR TELL AND BY. RAN DOWN FROM OFFICE FOR A MEETING WITH THE COUNTY. OF LOS ANGELES -- CHILD SUPPORT DEPARTMENT -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAO FRESH SINCE THE TIME THE CONVERSATION 45% OF THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT ARE ELIGIBLE BUT YET TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL FOR ASH. ON THAT'S DISTURBING TO ME -- BUT IS ALSO DISTURBING THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE AS A LEGISLATOR LEGISLATIVE BODY AND CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK WE HAVE A COMMON THEME GOING ON AT LEAST THIS YEAR ONE MAKING SURE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY. NOT GOING HUNGRY AND I THINK WE CONTINUE TO WORK IN CONCERT TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR GOAL -- WE CAN CERTAINLY SEE SOME OF THOSE REAL POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I'M LOOKING I'M VERY HOPEFUL THIS GOVERNOR WILL. EMBRACE -- KNOWING THIS BILL BUT ALSO OTHERS WILL WE TRYING TO DO. ART I THINK OUR JOB IS MADAMS HERE'S TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER IN CALIFORNIA IF WE TALK ABOUT LEADING THE WAY WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN THIS TIME. DURING THIS DISPENSATION TO REALLY MAKE CALIFORNIA GREAT AND REALLY LEAD THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS -- GOOD MEASURE BEFORE US -- AND I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO BE OFFER TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. I TO WANT TO THANK YOU I WANTED TO COMMENT. THAT YOU KNOW. YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVOCATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE QUALITY IN EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND BRINGING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. AND I THINK THAT. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY JUST REMINDS US THAT WE CAN? COME UP WE CAN GIVE OUR TESTIMONY AND IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE WE KNOW WE KNOW IT BY HEART. BUT THEN THEY'RE SOMETIMES WHAT IT WOULD JUST IT IT. FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND YET WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY WITH PEOPLE WHO CANNOT FIND A SHELTER. AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU DO ALL THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. OF WE HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION. SO SECOND. KAY NOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION. WE DID. MOVE. OF THIRTY FOUR FRIEDMAN REAVIS. WELL YOU KNOW. MY APOLOGIES TO MISS FRIEDMAN WAS REVERSED SORRY MR GIPSON MISTER MATHIS. WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK -- A LOT HAS BEEN SAID -- I THINK FOR MANY OF US THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THIS JOB. WE'RE DRIVEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE THAT SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR FOLKS AND I THINK THE MOMENT THAT WERE AND RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY DEMANDS IT -- AND WE CAN LEAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I I BELIEVE IT'S OUR MORAL OBLIGATION LEADS. IN THIS COUNTRY AND I JUST THINK THE ADVOCATES AND REALLY TRUTHFULLY MOSTLY THE FOLKS HAVE COMMUTER SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES. UNLIKE THOSE STORIES GUIDER VOTES ON THESE ISSUES SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. PLEASE TAKE THE WRONG. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE RIGHT YES HI RES I MATHIS. MATHIS I READ THIS [inaudible] RIVERSIDE CHOI. FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN I GIPSON. GIPSON AYE MAIENSCHEIN. STONE. STONE AYE. SIX ZERO THE BILL IS OUT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU [inaudible] MR HOLDEN [inaudible] WHAT MR HOLDEN WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- MEMBERS OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE OR WITH OUR STAFF ON THIS BILL AND DESPITE. OF THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE THE GREAT WORK -- THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US TO HELP GUIDE US. SECONDLY I WANT LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES THE MINUTES. OF THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE A FOUNDATION UPON WHICH FUTURE LEGISLATION COULD STAND. AB SIXTY NO WAY PERHAPS PROHIBITS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FROM REQUIRING A PERSON OF SELF TO SELF DISCLOSE THEIR OWN CONVICTIONS AND THEREFORE CREATING. A CANDOR TROUT. IT ALSO CODIFIES LANGUAGE THAT REINFORCE THE USE OF SIMPLIFIED EXEMPTIONS. AND ENSURES MORE PEOPLE RECEIVE CLEARANCE TO WORK AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. THE BILL ALSO CALLS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA FROM CLARENCE AN EXEMPTION APPLICATION SPECIFICALLY. DEMOGRAPHICS ON AGE ETHNICITY GENDER AND CONVICTED CRIMES FOR APPLICATIONS THAT ARE DENIED CLEARANCE AND EXEMPTIONS. CURRENTLY THIS INFORMATION IS NOT COLLECTED FROM APPLICATIONS THAT ARE DENIED OR GRANTED CLEARANCE OR EXEMPTIONS WHICH IS A GREAT DISSERVICE TO THE FACILITIES AND LEGAL CENTERS THAT FIGHT EVERYDAY. FOR THESE APPLICANTS RIGHTS TO WORK. THIS DATA WILL SHOW THE CONSISTENT OP OPPRESSION OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WHICH WILL HIGHLIGHT IN DEMAND FOR GREATER CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. WE GET EVERYONE ON EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND WITH THIS LANGUAGE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE REAL CHANGE TOGETHER. I THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B.. SIXTEEN OH EIGHT AND TESTIFYING TODAY IS SABINA COR SAID HE FROM PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AND A J. JILL OIL. MERRICK WHO ALSO REPRESENTS THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER. THANK YOU FIRST WITH THIS PLEASE THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SABINA CROSS CITY. I AM AN ATTORNEY AND THE POLICY MANAGER WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN AND ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CO SPONSORS ON THIS BILL WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. ELLIS P. C. WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND WORKS TO RESTORE THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF FORMALLY AND CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI. SIXTEEN OH EIGHT THIS BILL ADDRESSES A LONG STANDING PROBLEM WITH GETTING LICENSING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATIONS TO WORK IN THE AREA OF CHILD CARE. RESIDENTIAL NURSING AND GENERALLY THE CARE OF CARE OF INDIVIDUALS -- CURRENT LAW REQUIRES ANY PERSON WHO HAS A CONVICTION HISTORY FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A TRAFFIC TICKET TO APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION TO BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK. EVEN IF THE CONDUCT CONVICTION IS UNRELATED TO THE WORK AND IS DECADES OLD. THIS EXEMPTION PROCESS IS ONEROUS AND OFTEN CAN TAKE UPWARDS OF SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE. AS A RESULT MANY OTHERWISE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS MISSED JOB OPPORTUNITIES SINCE JOBS COULD NOT BE HELD OPEN UNTIL THE PROCESS IS FINISHED. OUR COALITION PARTNERS AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER HAVE CONDUCTED -- OR LOOKED RESEARCH INTO HOW THE PROCESS AFFECTS APPLICANTS FOR THESE JOBS AND FOUND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THIS PROCESS ARE WOMEN OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LOOKED LATINO WOMEN. WHO COMPRISE THE BULK OF INDIVIDUALS DOING THIS WORK? AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT AS AMENDED -- HAS THREE COMPONENTS IT REQUIRES THE D. S. S. S. TO KEEP BETTER DATA REGARDING THE EXEMPTION PROCESS. IT ELIMINATES THE CANDOR TRAP WHICH REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS TO SELF DISCLOSE INFORMATION THEY MAY NOT KNOW REGARDING THEIR OWN CRIMINAL RECORD. AND FINALLY IT BRINGS A SIMPLIFIED EXEMPTION PROCESS INTO STATUTE. THIS THIRD PART IS MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHILD CARE ADVOCATES ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE TO QUALIFY FOR THIS SIMPLIFIED PROCESS -- WE'VE CONFIRMED WITH THE S. S. THAT THE SIMPLIFY PROCESS WILL TAKE ONLY TWO WEEKS AS OPPOSED TO THE NORMAL EXEMPTION PROCESS WHICH CAN TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS. DATA WE RECEIVE FROM THE DSS SHOWS THAT DURING A SIX MINUTE PERIOD LESS THAN 10% OF THE PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR AN EXEMPTION WERE ACTUALLY DENIED BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD. BUT A MAJORITY OF OVER SIX THOUSAND DROPPED OUT OF THE PROCESSORS PROCESS OR HAD THEIR APPLICATIONS WITHDRAW -- DUE SOLELY TO THE LAND AND COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS. THIS BILL SUPPORT ALSO SUPPORTS PUBLIC SAFETY SINCE MANY OF THOSE WHO LOSE JOB OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THE ONEROUS EXEMPTION PROCESS WILL OFTEN FIND JOBS DOING THE SAME WORK THAT ARE NOT LICENSED POSITIONS. THEY DO NOT BENEFIT FROM PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THOSE POSITIONS HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ARE NOT LICENSE SO WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THEM SHOULD ISSUES ARISE. THIS BILL WILL HELP TO CORRECT THIS AND MAKE LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERWISE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WITH CONVICTION HISTORIES MORE READILY AVAILABLE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO PASS A BE SIXTEEN AWAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT YES OF THANK YOU OF MY NAME IS JAIL MYRICK AND I'M WITH THE EAST BAY COMMITTEE LAW CENTER AND I'LL JUST BRIEFLY SAY YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH CLIENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND ON A WEEKLY BASIS WITH THE CLIENTS WHO HAVE. WHO HAVE A PAST RECORD WERE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER AND ARMED WE STILL COULDN'T WHEN TERMS A DSS IN PARTICULAR WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF IT AND ANECDOTALLY WE STARTED NOTICING A PATTERN WHERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS? OLDER WOMEN A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND WE LOOKED AT OUR OWN DATA AND WE FOUND THAT 55% OF THE WOMEN WE HELP GOING TO THIS PROCESS. THAT WE HOPE WONDERS PROCESS WERE SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN SO THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S CLEARLY ARM OF A ISSUE THAT -- FURTHERING ARM IN A SEXUALITY -- AND OPPRESSION OF FOLKS WHO ARE. ALREADY STRUGGLING -- BUT THEN WE'RE ALSO SEEING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS ARE PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS AND WITH THE HELP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WERE ABLE TO GET SOME NUMBERS. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND WE FOUND THAT. OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD TO THIS PROCESS IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DID IT BUT LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED ACTUALLY WERE DENIED BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD. THE BIGGEST GROUP WERE NOT PEOPLE DENIED OR APPROVED BUT AS SABINA MENTION WERE FOLKS WHO DROPPED OUT DURING THE PROCESS. SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE DROPPED OUT BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS SO. THERE'S CLEARLY A PROBLEM HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED ARM WE HAVE BEEN. SO HONORED TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE CHILDCARE. INDUSTRY WHO. ADDITIONALLY HAVE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN GET. TO THE SAME PLACE AND WE'RE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SOLVE THIS ISSUE -- AND SOLVE THIS PROCESS ISSUE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOLKS TO GET TO WORK. ARMED WITH OUT. WITHOUT CREATING ANY ISSUE ON PUBLIC SAFETY SO WITH THIS AMENDMENT ALLOWS THAT TO GO FORWARD AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR OFFERING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BELL MANY TIMES OUR SOCIAL WORKERS WANT TO GET THEY NEED TO GET AN INTERNSHIP WHILE THEY'RE GETTING THERE -- UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AND MANY COME FROM COMMUNITIES OF POVERTY SOME COME FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SOME DO HAVE PASSED INTERACTION WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

AS A COMPONENT OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AB ELEVEN THIRTY SIX REPLACES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WITH THE NEW DEPARTMENT. OF COMMUNITY LIVING. THAT WOULD PROVIDE. COORDINATED LEADERSHIP AND ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CARE GIVERS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE STATE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT THE CA. AUTHORIZED CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC PROGRAM SERVING OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OUR WRISTS BUT AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING. A RANGE OF SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN WITH DUPLICATION AND WITHOUT ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY. THESE DEPARTMENTS OPERATE IN A FRAGMENTED FASHION OFTEN WITH LITTLE DATA SHARING AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT ACROSS PROGRAMS THIS FRAGMENTATION IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES TO OLDER ADULTS. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CARE GIVERS IN A COORDINATED STREAMLINED FASHION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE BETTER SERVED. FOR YEARS STATE POLICYMAKERS HAVE CALLED FOR STRUCTURAL REORGANIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING YET THE VARIOUS RESTRUCTURING PROPOSALS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. GIVEN THE GROWTH AND THE AGING POPULATION THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY LIVING WILL ENSURE THAT OUR SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WILL RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY HAVE SO DESPERATELY SOUGHT. A WITH ME ARE A TERREL KELCH WITH C. FOR A AND CHRISTINE MILLS. UP IN ON AND ON ACT AND THINK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S KRISTINA MALES AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION SERVING TWENTY TWO OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY EIGHT INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. CENTERS HAVE BEEN. IN OPERATION FOR OVER FORTY YEARS THEY ARE DISABILITY SERVICES AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS LED BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THESE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THE FRAGMENTED. SERVICES OFFERED BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE AGING AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO CREATE. A SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT THROUGH A SUCH PROGRAMS AS AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS AND THE STATEWIDE EIGHTY R. C. ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MY PASS CHAIR ON ACTON. WHO IS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FREED CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING I SHE WILL TALK ABOUT THE REASONS WHY WE% SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT THIS IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITY BILLS FOR THE YEAR AND WE ARE EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY NIZARI IN? OFFICE ON IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ON A ACT THEN -- SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU -- A FREED AS PART OF IN THE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION OF NEVADA COUNTY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND ELEVEN EXTENDED PARTNERS FROM HOSPICE. TO MEDICAL CLINICS TO THE REGIONAL CENTER TO WORK TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF WHAT AGE THEY ARE WHAT TYPE DISABILITY THEY HAVE AND WHAT INCOME THAT THEY HAVE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TO COORDINATE THOSE SERVICES THROUGH CROSS TRAINING ACROSS ORGANIZATIONS WARM HAND OPS -- AND COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND GAPS IN SERVICES. WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING TO NOTE IS THAT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE THERE ARE SOME KEY ELEMENTS OF DEVELOPING STREAMLINED ACCESS TO SERVICES AND NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEMS? ANDON THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE DEVELOPED THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR REFERRAL TRUSTED REFERRALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE REFERRALS AS WELL AS PROVIDING PERSON CENTERED INDIVIDUAL IS INDIVIDUALIZED TYPE SERVICES. WHAT WE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH ON A LOCAL LEVEL IS ONE STATE LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC AS WELL AS UNIVERSAL ASSESSMENTS AND WAYS? TO COLLECT DATA TO DEMONSTRATE OUTCOMES AND TO BE ABLE TO BETTER COORDINATE SERVICES ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION SAID THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT -- WE REALLY NEED CONSISTENCY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE ARE QUITE A FEW LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER THROUGH THE EIGHTY OUR SEASON OTHER INITIATIVES FOR NO WRONG DOOR. BUT WE NEED THAT KIND OF CONSISTENCY ACROSS ORGAN AND COUNTIES AND JURISDICTIONS. WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT WE HAVE ALL THESE SILOS PROGRAMS YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WE WORK WITH THAT MAY NOT BE -- AN OLDER ADULT THAT NEED ACCESS FOR EXAMPLE TO A HOME DELIVERED MEAL BUT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THAT. SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TO NAVIGATE PEOPLE TO HOME MODIFICATIONS TO OTHER EL TSS SYSTEMS. THAT WOULD BENEFIT THEM TO BE ABLE TO LIVE SAFELY -- AND INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR HOME AS LONG AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE THERE. SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE INDIVIDUALS. THROUGH THE VERY SILENCE SYSTEMS AND WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT AND SO THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE WAY WE SEE THIS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION ON COMMUNITY LIVING. WE'VE BROUGHT TOGETHER AGING WE BROUGHT TOGETHER DISABILITY -- AND WORK TOGETHER TO HELP INCREASE ACCESS AND LEOPARD I LIMITED RESOURCES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WITNESSES WITH. IT MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TERRA CELTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES.

TO ITEM TWENTY ONE AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX YEAH WE ARE AT THE THE END OR NEAR THE END. FOR FOR YOU I THINK HI. SO WHAT MR MEMBERS I PRESENTE BE SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX RELATING TO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FROM GRANTING A CRIMINAL RECORD CLEARANCE. OR EXEMPTION UNTIL IT RECEIVED AN INDIVIDUAL STATE AND FEDERAL RECORD. CRIMINAL RECORD DSS IS TASKED WITH PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS PRESENT IN THE CARE FACILITIES IT LICENSES WHICH INCLUDES. THE PROPER VETTING OF STAFF THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE CLIENTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES DSS FAILED. TO OBTAIN SELF DISCLOSURE FORMS DETAILING IN INDIVIDUALS OUT OF STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY AND GRANTED OCCURRENCE IN ADVANCE RECEIVING THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL HISTORY. THIS FAILURE TO REVIEW AN INDIVIDUAL'S COMPLETE CRIMINAL HISTORY CREATES A SITUATION WHEREBY DANGEROUS OR ON AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS CAN BE GRANTED ACCESS TO FACILITIES THAT HOUSE OR PROVIDE SERVICES TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HERE WITH ME TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. IS MISTER BOB HARRIS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DID YOU ARE PERCENTAGES AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS I CAN DO WHATEVER THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE I HAVE A SHORT LITTLE A BRIEF AMOUNT OF DETAIL I CAN PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE IF THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S GOING OF INTEREST. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S BOB HARRIS I'M AN AUDIT PRINCIPLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICEI WAS ALSO THE PROJECT MANAGER ON OUR MOST RECENT AUDIT OF THE CARE GIVER BACKGROUND CHECK BUREAU. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES -- I WON'T REPEAT WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALREADY COVERED I WILL JUST -- REITERATE THAT -- OUR OFFICE DOESN'T TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON BILLS BUT THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS A RECOMMENDATION WE MADE AS PART OF OUR AUDIT SPECIFICALLY BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES BE REQUIRED TO WAIT FOR BOTH THE STATE BACKGROUND CHECK INFORMATION THE STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION. AND TO THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION BEFORE GRANTING ACCESS TO A LICENSED CARE FACILITY -- CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WAIT FOR EVEN THE SELF DISCLOSURE FORM WHERE INDIVIDUALS WOULD REPORT WHETHER THEY HAD OTHER OUT OF STATE CONVICTIONS BEFORE GRANTING ACCESS. I WILL NOT THOUGH WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHETHER THIS WOULD THIS CHANGE TO THE LAW WOULD UNREASONABLY DELAY THE BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS AND FOUND -- BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE REVIEWED THAT IT WOULD NOT TO DELAY THAT BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS AN UNREASONABLE FASHION ESSENTIALLY THE STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO SOCIAL SERVICES AROUND THE SAME TIME OR EVEN AFTER THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION SO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THERE. WOULD BE UNREASONABLE DELAYS TO THE BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS OUR RECOMMENDATION AND IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. THANK YOU. WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADELINE COOPER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION.
