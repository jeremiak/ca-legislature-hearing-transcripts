LAUREN BUYER VICE PRESIDENT- SECURITY- FOR AIRLINES FOR AMERICA AIRLINE- BUT TED PRESIDENT OF HIS VISIT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALL FOR BEING HERE- I THINK WE'LL START WITH FRANK. GOOD GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS FRANK MILLER AND I M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HOLLYWOOD BURBANK AIRPORT. AND SERVICE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS COUNCIL. THE CARD FOR ITS CAST WAS COMPRISED OF THAT THIRTY ONE COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION TRAVEL PASSENGERS TRANSIT THROUGH CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS EACH YEAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AS EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF HIGHLY HIGHLIGHTED CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS SERVICE GATEWAYS FOR INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS AND SAFE AND SECURE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FIRST BASE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IS OUR HIGHEST. READY WITH REGARD TO DE FORCE WORRIED ABOUT OCTOBER. THE TASK HANNITY DMV'S AROUND THE COUNTRY IS DAUNTING ESPECIALLY THE SIZE OF THE TASK IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT CAN YOU PULL THAT MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER. YOU FOR SERVICE THIS. THAT'S GOOD. CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DMV SINCE THEY ARE APPROACH US IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS PRESENTED AT TO A DIRECTOR THINGS INCLUDE DISCUSSION WITH THE DE RECTOR AT OUR MOST RECENT LAST. THE DIEM. PORTS ELECTRONIC AND PRINCE AND MESSAGING THAT WE BEGAN TO DISPLAY IT SECURITY CHECKPOINT AREAS IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE'RE ALSO WERE. A N. CREATING MORE SIGNAGE TO A PLACE AROUND THE AIRPORT TERMINAL BURBANK AND I'M SURE THE OTHER AIRPORTS AROUND THE STATE ARE DOING THE SAME THING. BELIEVE ALERT FREE TO THE NEW REQUIRE. THE DMV HAS ALSO SET UP INFORMATION TABLES INSIDE TERMINALS AT SOME AIRPORTS THOUGH AIRPORTS HAVE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE DMB ESTABLISHED TEMPORARY READ THE ENROLLMENT CENTERS IN PORTRAIT ALMOST SIMILAR TO TSA PRE CHECK IN ROMAN CENTER AT AIRPORTS. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CEASE LETTER THEN TRANSFER XIN SECRETARY. DIRECT ANSWER THE DMV TO. URGING THE STATE'S OF THE AND SETTING UP SAT AND ROMAN CENTERS AT AIRPORTS. WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROCESS REAL. ID APPLICATIONS AT AIRPORTS FOR MORE FREE CAN TRAVEL. MISSION AND MINNESOTA HAVE BOTH BOARD RELY. ENROLL TENORS. LAST WEEK I JOINED OTHER AIRPORTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY IN WASHINGTON DC AND RELY D. WAS A PRIMARY TOPIC OF DISCUSSION. CONGRESS IS KEENLY AWARE TURN AS A HERE FROM AIRPORTS AIRLINES AND THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. TWO STATES- TOLD HAVE NOT YET BEGUN TO ISSUE REAL THESE. IN ADDITION TO THE T. SHS IMPLEMENTED A HIRING FREEZE WITH NO DEFINITIVE DATEABLE AIRING PHRASE MAY BE LEFT. RUSHING BACK IN DEADLINE I WON PRECHECK AND GLOBAL ENTRY TO SATISFY THE REAL ID REQUIREMENT SHOULD ALL BE OPTIONS FOR CONSIDER. BUT WHAT WORRIES ARE POOR MAN. I'M DOUBLE PERIODIC PASSENGER THE TWENTY TWENTY AND A SEASONED TRAVELER WHO NEVER GOT THE MEMO. AND ALSO PASSAGE TO MAY DEPART AN AIRPORT PRIOR TO OCTOBER FIRST AND THEN TRY TO RETURN HOME AND HAVE ARE TOLD THAT THE CONSOLE OR BOARD AN AIRPLANE. THE IMPACT INJURES NINE SECURITY CLEARANCES UNKNOWN. LARGE NUMBERS COULD SLOW SECURITY LINES AND WOULD CERTAINLY INCREASED AIRLINE TICKET COUNTER CONGESTION. WELL AIRLINES ACCOMMODATE PASSENGERS IN WAY FEES TO CHANGE YOUR FLIGHT. OPERATIONALLY AIRPORT LINES COULD BE CHALLENGED TO MANAGE THE EXTRACTION AFTER LUGGAGE FROM THE BAGGAGE SYSTEM BELONGING TO PASSENGERS LATER TONIGHT CLEARANCE AT THE SECURITY CHECKPOINT. THE DMV MOVE FORWARD AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AIRPORTS CONTINUE TO MESSAGE TO PASSENGERS AND TO CONGRESS AND HELPS COVER OCULUS SAVE. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND TEMPORARY REAL ID ENROLLMENT CENTERS EITHER MOBILE OR STATIONARY AT CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS. AIRPORTS WOULD WELCOME THAT ENHANCE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DMV AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF AIRPORTS WOULD BE READY TO GO TOMORROW THE SPACE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE DAY.

YOU KNOW THE CORONA BY SEND AND CONSUMERS BEING CONSUMED BY THAT MESSAGING AND SO IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US NOW. AND THREE. I THINK IT'S SIMPLY NOT HOLDING THIS HEARING AND THAT WE HAVE THAT SYNERGY BECAUSE IN GETTING IT'S ALL ABOUT REACH FREQUENCY AND LAYER MESSAGING SO YOU FINALLY KIND I CAN BREAK THROUGH TO THE TRAVELING DOES IT HAVE ANSWER QUESTION. THANK YOU TIME. THE THREE OF YOU AS IS THERE ANYBODY INDICATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO. DEFERRED THE DEADLINE FOR THE REAL ID. YOU'VE HEARD OF. THIS QUESTION SO I'LL ASK IT YEAH OR HEARING. WHICH CHAIR IN THE IT WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT MOST LIKELY THE EXTENSION WILL NOT HAPPEN. AND BECAUSE OF THE TWO BECAUSE THAT DOES DATE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN THE AND THEY FEEL THAT THE TIMEIS NOW TO. ENACT THIS EVEN- WITH. CURRENT HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE UNITED STATES. THAT DID NOT COME TO THE DISCUSSION I HAD. THERE THERE ARE GETTING THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VIRUS BUT DIDN'T THEY WERE IN RAISING THAT AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITH WITH ME ON THE REAL THE- IT. ALSO YES SIR AS AS THEN IN MY TESTIMONY- WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY INDICATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY INTEND TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE- AND I WOULD ALL- THAT- EVEN. AND AS WE GET CLOSER TO OCTOBER IF WE WERE IF THEY WERE SAID STARTING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. OF THAT STILL WILL OF THIS PROBLEM EVENTUALLY I KNOW YOU KNOW IT IS A CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND THEREFORE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. NEED TO ADD TO IT FOR SO. FROM OUR SIDE THAT WERE COMMITTED. OF UT CONTINUING THAT OUT. TO GET THE STATURE. OF COMPLY OF. THE SENATE. SOME OF THE OTHER PANEL OF WITNESSES ON MY AND WE MIGHT SEE SOME MOVEMENT RIGHT BEFORE OCTOBER FIRST JUST DEPENDING BUT- THEY'RE HOLDING WHEN OUR SMALL YEAH RIGHT. JUST TO CREATE THAT PRESSURE LIKE A LOT OF THE- BLAME FOR THE RELATED PROBLEM- NATIONAL QUESTION- I KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW- IN OTHER STATES. IN THE UNITY SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT THE AIRPORT WE WOULD BURBANK AIRPORT AND OTHER AIRPORTS ARE WHAT KIND OF A COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND AIRPORTS EXIST IN OTHER STATES THAT WE DON'T HAVE. HERE AND THEN PERHAPS. CAROLINE WITH THE TRAVEL. THAT WE CAN. IF YOU CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE MINNEAPOLIS ST PAUL AIRPORT I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS AT A SODA HAS MOVED FORWARD WITH WORKING WITH THE D. E. THE- PULLED. IT ONLINE. SODA AND THEN THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY'RE PASSING THROUGH THE AIRPORT TO PICK UP AND THEIR DOCUMENTATION AND THAT DOES REQUIRE THAT THEY THE PHOTOS THE AIRPORT AND THEN THE IT IS ISSUED THEM IN A DAY TO REP TOLD ME THAT THEY ALSO HAVE. THE PARTY WHERE THE- PROCESS AT THE YEAR. HAS PORT. TO THEIR GET IN OUR PARTY. THE PARKING SO THERE IS A COLLABORATION HAPPENING. ON THE WAY TO THE GETTING THROUGH THE GATE THEY HAVE TO HAVE ONE WILL STOP JUST AT ONE TIME BY. OKAY SELF RIGHT. YES THAT DONE BY A PRIVATE COMPANY. HE DID NOT SAY AND I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BY THAT IS I CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE TO YOU LATER ABOUT THE OTHERS. NO I SEE- MASK COORDINATION BY THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY NOW I EASE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO EVEN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY WASN'T COORDINATING ON THIS FOR CALIFORNIA THEY IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES I THINK ARE THERE 82% OF OUR TAVEL SPENDING ACTUALLY IS CALIFORNIANS TRAVELING AROUND CALIFORNIA THAT'S BROWN AND- BUT NONE I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF THE SATURATION OF WHAT WERE SEEN AS TO BE ABLE TO. RIDLEY HAVE SYSTEM. RIGHT AT CALIFORNIANS I AM IN AIRPORTS ALMOST EVERY DAY- BURBANK'S DONE A GREAT JOB BUT THERE'S OTHERS THAT IT'S I A HE SAY IT TO IT IT'S A HIT AND MISS BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THE- ALSO. TSA AT THE FEDERAL APPARATUS AND I THINK THERE'S A LACK OF CONSISTENCY WHEN YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO SHOW YOUR ID THERE- IF IT'S NOT REAL ID THERE SHOULD BE A VERBAL SOMETIMES THERE'S A SIGN AT THE AIRPORT BUT WHY VERBAL IT'S THE BREAK THROUGH OF MESSAGING WE NEED A CONSUMER EVEN A BLIND TO THE SIDE BUT IT AUDIO SO TSA. IF I IF I MIGHT SIR. FROM THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY SIDE AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE- LAST YEAR EARLY LAST YEAR BUILT A COALITION WITH OUR TRUCK MINISTRY PARTNERS- SUPPORTS REPRESENTING THE AIRPLANES FROM MYSELF BUT- ALSO THE AIRPORT ASSOCIATIONS. US TRAVEL ASSOCIATION DOUBLE BUSINESS TRAVEL ASSOCIATION ON OUR INTENT THERE WILL IS- TO A POOL OF RESOURCES IF YOU WELL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR HISTORY ARE DOING TO THE WORD OUT. I'M TO DE CONFLICT% WHERE PASTA. ALL TO. UP AND- COME UP WITH SOME BEST. IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION TO THE PUBLIC ON THAT WE COULD THEN SHARE WITH OUR WITH OUR MEMBERS AND WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. SO I THINK THAT KEY ELEMENT HERE IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION OF THE- COLLABORATION AND OTHER STATES WITH THE- I WOULD. ON IT VARIES. VARIES WIDELY BUT THAT'S PRECISELY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE IN TRYING TO BUILD THOSE BEST PRACTICES IN PUSH THOSE OUT. TO THE- HELLO. I WOULD. OF T. PAY ALSO DOING PART TO GET THE WORD OUT THEY'VE BEEN GOOD PARTNERS WITH US AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS I MENTIONED IN MY TO MONY WITH NUMBER ENGAGEMENTS WITH THEM TO TRY TO A LOT MESSAGE AND AN AMPLIFIER. AND I'M I'M NOT WHERE I LAST INSTRUCT. HER ALL. AT AIRPORTS TO ADVISE. PASSENGERS INTO OF THE TRAVEL DOCUMENT CHECKER THE- OFFICER STANDING THERE THE TEXTURE ID. ON THAT WHEN SOMEONE PRESENTS THAT ARE NON COMPLIANT IDEA TO ADVISE THE ASSN- THAT WANED A LITTLE BIT OVER THE HOLIDAY PERIOD. BUT WE'VE BEEN IN YOU KNOW DAILY COMMUNICATION WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE A SHORT US- BUT THEY WILL- REINFORCE THEIR DIRECTION INTO THE FIELD- TO START UP THAT MESSAGING INDIVIDUAL PASSENGER AGAIN AND SO WE AGREE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. A SHORT CLOSE CENTER DAHLE DOLLY ANALYSTS ARE MORE LOG I BELIEVE. SO SIR WORK STATE AND CEREMONY OR- THANK YOU I DID BATES. WE WERE HAVING QUITE A FEW- FOLKS THAT WE CAUGHT CASE WORKS THERE CALLING OUR OFFICE THERE TO THE INFORMATION THAT. SEEMS TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IS THE INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE SO IN OUR CASE HINES TALKED FOR ON ONE CASE I HAD BECAUSE OF. WHO IS TRYING TO LOCATE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IT'S A IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM A. B. ANOTHER STATE. AND THE COURT WHERE HE- ON ON BUT WHEN. ACTUALLY GET HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE A WAS EIGHTY THREE OLD IS THERE ANYBODY DOING. CAMPAIGN TO SAY HEY THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU NEED THAT WILL QUALIFY YOU TO GET. I DIESEL WITH ACTUALLY GO. THERE GETTING THROUGH THE PROCESS DOT HAPPEN TO GO BACK IN FOR THURSDAY. IN THE ANIMAL LITTLE WANTING IT WHAT IS THE NAY NEED TO TAKE TO GET THE REAL ID. UP SO. AT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES- BUT IT'S BUT IT'S COMPLICATED AS A AS WITH MOST THINGS- THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS DO VERY STATE BY STATE. SO IT'S CHALLENGING AT A NATIONAL LEVEL WELL TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN SIMPLE TERMS EXACT FIREMAN BECAUSE OF. THIS SO THE WAY THAT WE HAVE- ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS AT IS IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS I MENTIONED WE SEE. AWAY REAL THE FACT COM CLUE BUT STATE BY STATE. SO THAT THAT RIGHT IN EACH STATE. LOSE OF WHERE. THEY LIVE FOR EXAMPLE CAO. AND THEN DIG DEEPER INTO THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF CAL YEAH. GOVERNOR WITHIN AIRPORT THE PERSPECTIVE ON IT WE ARE NOW JUST BEGINNING TO PUT TOGETHER ON SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION THAT GOES OUT TO OUR CUSTOMERS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE HAVING AND ARE PLACING A WEBSITE INFORMATION. AND THE TERM. VIDEOS THAT TO HELP BE ABLE TO PLAY IN THE GATE AREAS AND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT IS EXACTLY YOUR QUESTION WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TAKE FIRST. IN ORDER TO. TRY TO PROCESS. THIRTY TO. I'M ASSUMING THAT THE WE GET THE CALLS IN OUR OFFICE ABOUT THAT AFTER THE DAVID HIGHLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE PROCESS AT LEAST THAT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE A MOBILE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THE ACTUALLY JUST CONTINUE ALONG TO THE THERE'S- BUILDING PERMISSION. THE OF THE PROCESS GET THROUGH THE PROCESS A LITTLE LEAGUE I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE I WROTE ON THAT WEBSITE AND I'LL BE POSTING AS WELL TO LET MY CONSTITUENTS KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO TO. AIR FOR WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO FACE WHEN THEY AND TO. GET THE REAL ID YOU. WORK OUT. OKAY SO ALL OF THIS SERVICE. ARE YOU ON THIS. BUT YOUR TO YOUR TO I ASSUME THE BEST PRACTICE OR THE MESSAGING THE BEST MESSAGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ONE THAT THE CONSUMER DOES SOMEONE IS AT OCTOBER SET IT ON THE AIRPLANE THAT MESSAGE WILL BE DELIVERED LACKS LIKE. TO ALL PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN IT THE SECOND BEST TO JUST COULD YOU TALK ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND- WHAT DO YOU. HOW US TRY TO BET WHAT THAT SECOND BEST MESSAGE RIGHT NOW IS OR WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THESE OTHER. AIRPORTS OR WITH OTHER HI INDEED INDUSTRY OR THE OTHER AIRLINES HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT'S FILTERING IN. DON'T WAIT. DON'T WAIT OF THE POINT IS ALREADY BEEN MADE THAT- YOU KNOW WE WE'RE IN MARCH- BUT- EVERYONE GOING IN SEPTEMBER CANNOT CANNOT BE THE ANSWER- SO IT'S SIMPLY DON'T WAIT AND IF YOU HAVE A AN ALTERNATE FORM OF IDENTIFICATION IN THAT A BIT LOUDER. SAMPLE PORT. THAT FINE. BUT THE BUT YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE I THINK DON'T CARRY THEIR PASSPORT WITH THEM ON A DOMESTIC TRIP SET SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP IN MIND. IT IS THE- IS THAT- YOUR MESSAGE ALSO THAT CARRY YOUR PASSPORT OR YOU KNOW WE WILL. WE'RE HAVING YOUR PASSPORT S. R. AND US TRAVEL AS I SAID HAD PUT TOGETHER THAT TOOL KIT FOR WHAT WE CALL BE TO BE MESSAGING OR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS MESSAGING THAT WE'VE LOOKED AND SO ARE ASSISTANCE PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IT'S- I'M- I AGREE THE IT. THE FIRST AND FOR MOST THE MESSAGING SHOULD WAIT BUT WE DO MESSAGE THAT PASSPORT OR OTHER FORMS OF ID- YOU KNOW ARE ARE ALSO APPROACH AND BAD. WORDS INTO. PUT THAT AS A SECONDARY MESSAGE BECAUSE A LOT OF AND SHE SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T TRAVEL WHAT PASS WORKS THAT'LL BE GREAT FOR THE SECOND SHOP BUT THERE MAY. I HAVE A- AND RELATED QUESTION I WANTED. FOUR TO OCTOBER SECOND. AND WE HAVE MADE HIM AND BURBANK EVERY EVERY LINE AT UNITED AIRLINES OR SOUTHWEST AIR EVERY EVERY AIRLINES TOURIST INDUSTRY ALL THESE. PORTABLE SO YOU HAVE- HER HAPPENING. HOW DO YOU GUYS RESPOND WILL LAST DMV ABOUT ABOUT THAT BUT HOW DO YOU FOLKS RESPOND WHEN THEY CAN DON'T GET ON THE AIRLINE AND ALL AND ALL THAT. HOW TO SET WHICH- THE PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY PLAN FOR US ON OCTOBER SECOND IS TO HAVE A VERY VISIBLE POLICE FORCE WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE A BIT SAID TO BE DROPPING TO MANAGE THE EMOTION. PEOPLE HAVE. NOT TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO ENSURE THAT FOR THOSE PASSENGERS WHO ARE COMPLY AND THE ABILITY TO GET THROUGH THE TERMINAL. BUT HAVING A DEAL. ALL THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE HAVE NOT REALIZE THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GRAPPLE ONTO AN AIRPLANE SO. THAT'S OUR BIGGEST TURN IS. IN OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH- AND HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE FOR US TO WORK THROUGH THAT. JUST CHAD- FROM THE AIRLINE PERSPECTIVE WE'VE COMMUNICATED TO THE FIVE GOVERNMENT THAT- IT'S REALLY AN UNTENABLE SITUATION- IF THAT WERE TO THAT THE ANSWER SIMPLY CAN'T BE ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS CAN'T BOARD- TSA HAS A- S. ALREADY OUT RIGHT NOW IF SOMEONE SHOWS UP AT A CHECK POINT WITHOUT. OUT WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION- AND- TSA IS COMMUNICATED UNFORTUNATELY THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE SYSTEM WOULD BE OVERWHELMED GIVEN THE CURRENT. AND ANALYST DURATION THIRTY FOUR FIVE. RYAN OF RESOURCE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN AND CLEAR PEOPLE THROUGH. THAT PASSED SO WE ARE OUT BILLION GATE. THE I ON ALTERNATE. THAT WE BE ANYTHING AN INDIVIDUAL SPORT IS THERE ANY WITH. INSERT YOUR BOOK YOU GET YOU SEE. MESSAGE TO SAVE PASS OR YOU KNOW DOUBLE THE BRING YOUR IF YOU'RE IN DOUBT WHAT YOUR ID BRING YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU WERE YOU GUYS WOULD SAY BRING YOUR SUPPORT JUST TO MAKE YOUR OWN GOING ON. OUR YOU'RE GOING. YES THE AIRLINE ALREADY COMMUNICATING WITH PASSENGERS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AS AS I MENTIONED IN THE TESTIMONY BUT THAT WOULD INCLUDE OUT REAL ID REMINDERS- IN INCLUDING. OR OTHER FORMS OF OLD AND IDENTIFICATION- IN THEIR RESERVATION CONFIRMATIONS IN CHECK AND REMINDERS EXCEPT ARRESTED THAT COMMUNICATION IS OCCURRING. ACCENTOR MORE LIKE I'M SORRY. I'M COMING OUT OF A- CERTIFIED BUT ACCOUNTING BACKGROUND APRIL FIFTEENTH IS COMING AND WE WOULD ALWAYS JOKE THAT NOTHING WOULD GET DONE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE LAST MINUTE. REALLY KIND OF SHOWS. FIFTEEN WE HAD THIS BIG SPIKE TO WORKLOAD. SO I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOU YOU BEEN MESSAGING. BUT IT IS OLD THE REAL ID ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE. I GET PEOPLE OBSERVING THE ROOM THAT THAT'S A LIFETIME. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHEN DID YOUR MESSAGING START TEN YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO. WHAT WE WOULDN'T IF YOU HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION THAT SHOWS GET YOUR REAL LIKE THE- I'M JUST CURIOUS YEAH I MEAN I'LL TELL ON OURSELVES OUR MESSAGING STARTED- AS PART OF A DEAL WITH THE INDUSTRY ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

AND WE GOT. VERSION OF IT IN UPON WHICH WE- TAKE THAT ONE OBSTACLE OUT OF THE WAY IT WILL BE TESTING THAT FEEL LATER THIS MONTH WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE START PROMOTE. REAL TIME IT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE LOOKING FOR OVERTIME. YOU ARE STARTING FORM THEY'RE COMING TO THE PAGE THERE SHOWING INTEREST AND CURIOSITY BUT THEY'RE NOT IF YOU ARE NOT PUNCHING IT.

PARTNER WITH THEM TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THE LAB AT THE DMV TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS PROBLEM SO IT AS A MINIMAL EFFECT ON THE CALIFORNIA. I HAD TO DO THAT SO REACH OUT TO ALL THE AIRLINES% DIRECTLY TO REACH OUT TO THE AIRPORT COUNCIL THAT IS THE REPRESENTATIVE AS WELL CONSTITUENTS AT THE- HE- TO BOTH YOU. JOINT MARKETING PROGRAMS AS YOU MENTION. THAT VIDEO BILL THAT'S PLAN IN VARIOUS AIRPORTS THAT SOURCE FROM THE DMV FLY THROUGH SMF APERTURE AS MANY OF YOU DO.

IN BEING ABLE TO ABLE TO A MOBILE OPPORTUNITY GET MORE CUSTOMERS ARE BUT I THINK. ALSO WRITTEN. DMV TO YOU THERE BEEN NEAR TEN THOUSAND OR O- RE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

YEAH PROGRAM IS IT SAYS ONE. AND IS FULL. INTO THE CAN OFFICE. OF THE THREE STRATEGIES TO GET BEYOND BEING MORE. AT THE AIRPORT MORE WORK OF A LIGHT MOBILE SUIT AS WE- DO YOU A- STRATEGY. WITH YOU KNOW 50% REDUCTION IN IS SIGNIFICANT AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE AVERAGING JUST ABOUT TEN MINUTES YOU TAKE WE TAKEN FROM TWENTY MINUTES TO TEN THAT SIGNATURE ATHLETE END OF THE THREE ABOUT IS THE ECONOMIC VALUE TO CAL. EIGHTEEN THERE US. INTO THE- YOU IT DOES DOES OF THE PROCESSES WOULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING THIS SITUATION THAT WE HAVE FROM A HEALTH STANDPOINT WITH THE- BYRON VIRUSES RESTRICTIONS ON ON. PEOPLE GATHERING AND LARGE LOCATIONS LIKE THE DMV AT IS THE DMV- STUDYING. RESTRICTIONS ON VISITING TO THE OFFICE SO INTENTIONAL LAST QUESTION FIRST- NO RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE TODAY VISITING A DMV OFFICE PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN AND WE ARE FOLLOWING ALL ALL THE HEALTH PLANS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY IS YEAH WE GET INTO THIS MESS WHERE THERE ARE A LARGE CON. ANY AGAIN MY- THE- THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TRAVELING AND GOING TO PLACES WERE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE NOT. I'M THAT WOULD HAS IT THE HESITATION TO. GO TO THE DMV OFFICE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT COULD BE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DAMPENING OF TRAFFIC INTO THE DMV OFFICES BUT I SUSPECT THAT THIS. CRISIS EVOLVES PEEPER BUT IF YOU'RE A BACK BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT SORT OF LARGE POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE TO ONE YOUR POINT BOB DONNAN TURN OF. WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE CAUGHT ARE ARE OPEN INSIDE THE SIGNIFICANT AIRPORTS WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC. IF THOSE ARE INSIGNIFICANT AT NUMBERS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT HE'LL BE ABLE GET YOUR- I JUST DO ONE A DAY WE WANT TO BE DO. HOUSE INCIDENT. THE TRAFFIC THAT IT CAN BE VERY AND- IN AN ARBOR TO ATTRACT WE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSING WITH SPORTS TEAMS AND SO ON. SO BE IT A SPORT. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS ARE. FORTY NINE IN YOUR BACKYARD COULD GO TO A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS PEOPLE BUT THEM THE VIRUS OF COURSE WAS PUT THOSE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS BE COUNTY ADDRESS. TO THE- YEAH. YES AS I WRITE. EXT THE DAY THE- ADDRESS. OKAY OF I THINK CENTER MORE LARK AND- SIR DOLLY OKAY SIR MODOC BURDEN YOU'RE NEW TO THE DEPARTMENT I CAN'T. ASK OKAY QUESTION. IT IS IT IS AND I I'M JUST CURIOUS I HAD A COMPLAINT JUST YESTERDAY AND MAYBE SO NUMBER CAN ANSWER THIS ONE BUT A GENTLEMAN WHEN IN THE DO YOU. OF ALL. HIS MILITARY ID WHICH SHOULD INDICATE THAT HE'S ALREADY SHOWN APPROVED A BIRTH CERTIFICATE ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. YEAH HEFELT THAT THAT WAS SATISFACTORY SUBSTITUTE BUT HE WAS DECLINED AND IT'S FOR THE APPOINTMENT DID I'M JUST WONDERING WHY- CERTAIN. FEDERAL DOCUMENTS WOULDN'T BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING SHOULD BACK UP. CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF ALREADY SHOWN SHOWN SOMEONE TO GET THE ARE THAT YOU QUALIFY THAT THAT THAT'S RIGHT I DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF THE SITUATION WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO THIS CONSTITUENTS. THE THEN THE NET OF IT IS THERE ARE SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE DEFINED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE FOLLOW THOSE TO THE LETTER SO WE DO NOT GET REAL ID'S INVALID IN THE CITY YEAH. A VERY GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE SONS AS OUR BROAD RANGE OF DOCTORS BUT THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE IDENTITY DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. SO COULD BE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WHEN SUCH AS WERE IT UP. SO OFTEN ALSO SHOULD BE THAT. COP HIM TO SEND SOME OUT SEND THEM BACK TO OFTEN GET MORE DOCUMENT. BUT THE IMPORT OF THIS. ONLINE SOME WORK ON A DMV EXPRESSED BUT THAT ON THE SYSTEM. DEVELOP A- PREACHER. THIS IS AN- LOAD. AS THE FOR DOCTOR THAT ARE. IT WOULD TELL YOU WHETHER NOT THOSE MATCH THE MINIMUM CRITERIA TO GET A REALITY. OUR HOPE IT BE ABLE TO DE RISK IT FROM THE- PERSPECTIVE SO HELPING SUCCESSFUL. AND LESS STRESS BECAUSE NOW THEY KNOW RIGHT NOW PEOPLE COME IN. WHAT IS OF SOME AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAVE. AND HE WOULD BE IF WE CAN. THIS IS A BEEN TODAY IN THE IN.

CENTER MORE LIKE ASKED IF YOU THE QUESTIONS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I HAVE- MAYBE LITTLE TWIST HERE ONE IS. GIVING OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN SO WE YOU KNOW WE'VE ACTUALLY FIRST BALK CITED HERE THE HOW MY REAL IDEA. BECAUSE I HAVE. SECURE ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED TO GO TO THE- DMV WHICH I'LL BE DOING HERE SHORTLY SO I'M HOPING MY EXPERIENCES TENANTS I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE DMV. UNDER A HALF HOUR OF MY LIFE SO I'M GONNA ACTUALLY GUILTY I IT SEE HOW. WELL WERE. I'M WE'VE WE'VE BEEN FUSED TO LEARN. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I HAVE HERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT NEW PERMANENT POSITION SINCE. AND THEN A CONTINUE OF NINE HUNDRED- TEMPORARY POSITIONS SO THAT SOME. IS DRY AND- THAT WAY TIME WE HAVE MORE. ARE SAYS IT. AND THEN ALSO. IN HERE THAT WE CAN ALL. SO IT PASSED THE TEAM NOT. THAT TIME THE UPGRADES A DID ONE. VERY GOOD UPGRADE IN ACTUALLY. MADE THE SYSTEM NOT WORK AS WELL- SO IN YOUR TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES CAN YOU GIVE ME. BACKGROUND YOU ACTUALLY DID AND- AND I WANT YOU TO TOUCH ON IT BEING SECURE- YOU KNOW YOUR- CARD INFORMATION. TAKING DEBIT CARD FOR. YOU ARE TAKING ALL OF INFORMATION NOW BIRTH CERTIFICATES AND THE LIKES HOW HOW'S THAT INFORMATION SECURE THAT IS REALLY PERSON INFORMATION TO SOMEBODY'S PERSONAL LIFE APSO GOOD SET OF QUESTIONS THERE. PROCESS I MENTIONED YOU REDUCING THE CYCLE TIME IF YOU WILL FROM TWENTY EIGHT TO TEN AS WE EXPECTED SCALED SO THAT. KIND OF. THREE ARE PERCENT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IS JUST THE WAY BODIES AT IT WE'RE HAVING MAKE MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE ARE. ARE DOING WORKS. GOING BE BLOOD. WE THAT THAT YEAH I'M WITH YOU ON THAT SO ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT I MEAN WE ARE USING THINGS THAT THAT ARE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW TIED IN THIS STANDARD. WITH THE- SPANISH FOR INFORMATION. MAKING SURE THAT SUMMIT. BUT A DOCUMENT. IT SURE THAT IT. YEP CITY TRAGIC. WE SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED PRESIDENT OF THE WERE FINE ALTHOUGH STANDARDS TO ME THE PEOPLE'S INFORMATION STATE. THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK EVERY YOU. DOCTRINE INTO AND I CARE IN YOUR CAR WHATEVER. WAS REST WE ARE TAKING ALL THE PRUDENT. AND FEDERAL DEFINED STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE WANT TO. KEEP INFORMATION STAYS SAFE AND CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE- THEY TRUST GOVERNMENT. YEAH TRY TO SECURE ON SOME OF FOR P. I. PERSPECTIVE WE WE'VE ALSO. THE COME STANDARD WHERE. ANY I AM. WITH RESPECT TO. YEAH THE WHERE. ARE OUR APPLE IS WE- HAVE TO FILL OUT OKAY BUT WHEN YOU USE YOUR- CARD DIRECT OUT TO THE CREDIT CARD VENDORS SITE. SO THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT CITY THE DMB AT ALL WE HAVE NO ABILITY. TO YOUR CARD INFORMATION SO WE REDUCE THAT RISK. WORKING PROFESSIONALS VERY FOCUSED AND THE WIND IS. NOW BACK TO DO OUT. TECHNOLOGY IS CHALLENGING ABSOLUTELY. NUMBER THINGS IT. STAND I MEAN TO IMPROVE OUR OUR FRONT INSIST MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM TIP TIP TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT WE CAN HAVE SUPPORT ABILITY THE SYSTEMS ARE UPGRADED SURE THAT THEY WILL OUR FAULT TOLERANT AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORT PLATFORMS. NUMBER THIS IS A OUR NETWORK WE HAVE GONE FROM A LITTLE BURKE- VERY DATED DMV VERY WELL RISE IN WE SWITCH TO AN OFF BURKE OUT OVER COMCAST WERE TEN SITES. ANOTHER SEVEN. AGO BUT WE ARE ACTIVE WELL IN TIED TO PROCEED. OF COURSE BACK. A THOSE SITES BUT ALSO. AS WELL BUT IT WOULD APPROVED THING IN THE RIGHT OUR- APPROACHES BROUGHT HIS NEW SOLUTIONS HAVE TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND BUT ALSO SOME OF MY SEE LEADERS HAVE. BACKGROUND AS WELL TRYING TO MAKE SMART MAKE SURE THEY FIT A- SURE THERE. AND THAT FOR EXAMPLE WITH CALM LOSING IT. MULTIPLE LEVELS RE. SO IF THE PRIMER LINK FAIL WE HAVE A BACK UP EVEN A CHURCH SOLUTION SO WE ARE IN TRYING TO BE. WITH THE TAX BERMAN I AM A TAXPAYER TOO- AND WHICH- THIS THIS FIVE SUPPORTER NEEDS. SO ARE. WE HAVE A- THAT DATA BEING COLLECTED YOU KNOW THEN THE PASTOR WAS THE- THEY WERE SELLING FAKE. A CLASS ONE LICENSES SO I MEAN THAT THAT INFORMATION THAT IS BEING GATHERED IS HOW ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING TO LIKES MAKE SURE THAT YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE SECURE THAT THEY THEY THEY CAN'T TAKE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT I'M REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO GET A REAL ID ND USE IT FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE IS THERE ANY LIKE. DELETED DOUBLE CHECK OR TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOBODY TAKE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE PAST- THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE ACTUALLY WORK. AB THAT WERE SELLING. A COMMERCIAL LICENSES. YOU NEED TO TEST SO IS THERE A IS THERE ANYBODY CHECKING ON THAT- YEAH WE'RE CHECKING ON THE OF THOSE FRONT I THINK THAT THE- BRIEF. AND GIVEN THAT A CAME IN ON. THAT ARE CAUGHT IS HE DOING EXTRA MONEY. WATCH KEYSTROKE BY EVERY. WHO IS ACCESSING WHAT. THE LOOKING AT TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AND THEY CAN DETERMINE IF SOMEBODY IS. EXPEDITED PROCESS SO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING THE STEPS THAT ARE REQUIRED. IT'S TOO SHORT IT GETS TRIGGERED. FOR INVESTIGATION DETERMINED. IF SOMEBODY A PARTICULAR OFFICE MAY BE CHEATING ON ON A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S EXAM AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED. AS YOU SEEN MANY OF THOSE ARE OF THE PEOPLE. SAID THAT THAT'S ABOUT. AS TECHNICIANS TEAM. AND THEN BE THE BEEN USING THIS PROCESS SO WE HAVE A HALF. BROKE GRANT. IT WAS. ROVIDE TO MAKE. OUR TRACK. SURE THERE. IN THE- MAKE SURE THE FERRY AS WELL SO AS GIVING AWAY DRIVER'S AND SO AB ONE LAST QUESTION I REALLY PURSUE YOU I KNOW YOU'RE JUST BEEN ON THE JOB FOR A SHORT TIME AND THAT TO YOU KNOW OUT OF THE HIS THE- YOUR- YOUR HISTORY. IT IS. IT AT LEGISLATOR THAT WE SHOULD BE. CONSCIOUS OF IN THAT YOU KNOW IT DETECTS A TIME TO WORK THROUGH THESE PROCESSES AYE. I WAS I FOUND I WAS AWARE IN MINTAK I'M DOING SOME LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA. THAT THE D. B. WAS SELLING INFORMATION AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT NEED THAT INFORMATION SUCH AS ATTORNEYS- OR- PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS OR- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT- THEY'RE ALSO WHOLESALING OR INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE WHO SELL INFORMATION. NOT SO THE IT WOULD AT. USING A PROFIT OFF OF ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS OR SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THAT MONEY. UP SURE I THINK FIFTY DOESN'T START THE PROGRAM ITSELF TO THE PROGRAM'S ARCHER DEFINED AS IS PUBLIC SAFETY THEY CAME THROUGH LEGISLATION. LIKE THIS TO FIND THESE WHAT FOR PA SAFETY. WHAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. SHE DID COMMERCIAL CARRIERS ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR DRIVERS ARE SAFE ME FOR THAT THEY HAVE A VEHICLE. INFRACTIONS THAT THEY'RE NOTIFIED OF THIS. THAT'S THAT'S THE PRIMARY THEY CALL THIS THE PROGRAM LIKE FOR COMMERCIAL AS A POOL NOTICE YEAH I ACTUALLY. TRUCKER AND OF THE I MEAN THE POLOS PROGRAM BUT- THAT THAT'S INFORMATION THAT ARE. HARD TO GIVE THE REQUIRED TO REACH TO RECEIVE. TAKE IT I'M TALKING. PEOPLE WERE ABLE. INFORMATION IN IS THAT ARE PEOPLE WHO SELL AND FOR ARE A TO BUY I THROUGH THE PRO THROUGH THE DIEM ACCORDING THE INFORMATION I HAVE THAT'S WHAT I WANTED THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED BUT I'M NOT CONCERN ABOUT THAT THE NOTICED THAT THAT LAW AT. OUR OFFICE. IN YOU ARE COME DROP. GET A D. Y. THAT YOUR EMPLOYER KNOWS YOU GOTTA DO YOU AYE THAT'S GREAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE DONE OR IF YOUR- INSURANCE BROKER AND YOU NEED THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN PERCENT SINCE IT IS YOUR BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT- BY INFORMATION IT PERMISSION I HAVE THE BILL. AT THE ME TO BUY THAT INFORMATION OR NOT PAUL NOTICED NOT. SURE IT'S KIND ME THERE OUGHT OF THE INVEST. YEAH SO WHICH WE SHOULD COMPARE NOTES I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I'M AWARE FOR THEIR IN THIS PROGRAM ARE PURCHASED. CROSS PUBLIC SAFETY THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE JUST RANDOMLY WE DON'T SELL INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE IT THAT THAT. NOW WOULD LOVE TO SEE. BACK TO NINETEEN THE PROGRAM IS TO THEIR- GOVERNMENT AND ITS POTENTIAL JUST. THIS THE GOOD FOR. WHAT IT COSTS TO ACTUALLY. THE PROGRAM TO THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE'S NO. PROFIT THE DMV DOES MAKE A PROFIT. THAT ACOSTA. GOOD MINISTER THE- WHICH IS AGAIN IN THE LEGISLATION AND WE'RE HEARING TO THAT SO AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR CASE I AM HAPPY TO TALK TO OFFLINE.

THAT SERVICE REQUIRES A DEEP REPRESENT TO AUTHENTIC YOU. IS THERE ANY. WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS. ANTICIPATED SEARCH THIS SUMMER. THAT OUT OF PEOPLE THAT THE- DEAD. EITHER YOU YOU NEED SOME ASSISTANCE FROM US AND- THAT CENTER NUMBER WAS AND TO MEETING- OR- THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED. YET NOT AT THIS TIME I THINK VIDEO. STRATEGY WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY I THINK OUR- COMPREHENSIVE I THINK. WE WILL TELL. I THINK OVER THE NEXT. FORTY FIVE DAYS WE START. RE LAUNCHING PLEASE. LIMITS WILL PUT HIM TO HOW AFFECTED THEY ARE WE BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA BE VERY EFFECTIVE GIVEN THE FEEDBACK WE SEE FROM CUSTOMERS. AS AS A MENTION RIGHT CAN'T. FORCE PEOPLE WERE WERE NOT A MANDATORY STATE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DO AND THEY DO WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO CREATE INCENTIVES ADD TO GET PEOPLE TO BEHAVE LEADER IN THE MAYBE THEY PROBABLY WILL. BUT IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW WE DON'T CONTROL- WE DON'T FOR THE CONTROL THE CALIFORNIA'S TO GET THEM INTO THE OFFICE OR MAKE IT IS WE CAN. WHEN THE- SOME BOOKS AND- AFTER OCTOBER SECOND OKAY. AND IS THERE A LINE CAPABLE OF. HAVE ASSN HAVING A CHECK OFF WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A REAL ID OR NOT. AND IF NOT. HAVING. THE CUSTOMER. REFERRED TO THE REAL ID WEBSITE. IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK BUT CENTER DOLLARS POINT WAS WELL WHAT INFORMATION DO WE WANT TO SHARE WITH INDUSTRY WELL LIKE IF YOU HAVE. SOMEBODY BUYING A TICKET. IN THE ROOM MAYBE NOT AWARE OF THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE A REAL ID AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN. CITY BY THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE- INTO A ON A VACATION THEY- GET THEIR TICKETS AND UP FROM A TRAVEL AGENT OR- FROM UP. A PREVIOUS SPEAKER REALIZATIONS. THEY HAVE A CHECK OFFICE SAYS HEY I GUESS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET A REAL IDEA ENOUGH TO CHECK IS NO I DON'T HAVE ONE. IF THEY CAN BE A MAGICALLY RE DIRECTED YEAH DIRECTED TO THE READ RELY RELY D. DOT DMV DOT GOV. THAT'S YEAH THAT CA DOT GOV SO IT COULD AUTOMATICALLY FROM TO THE TO THE WEBSITE SAYING HEY YOU GOT IT YOU GOT TO FILL UP START DOING THIS RIGHT NOW. AND COULD BE THAT COULD BE A COORDINATION ISSUE WITH THEIR- TRAVEL INDUSTRY YEAH WE REACHED OUT TO ALL THE ALL THE MAJOR AIRLINES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. CRY DO AND UNDERSTAND ONE WITH THEIR CURRENT PLAN AND TRY TO ENCOURAGE AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE PLANS TO GET PLANTS SEEN SOME AIRLINES THAT HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB YOU KNOW UNITED HASN'T REALLY. OF PROMOTE WE- THE FOOD AND IT WAS NOT A MENTION AND I LOVE ALASKA I'M NOT HERE TO BAD MOUTH THE LATTER BUT IT JUST WASN'T THERE SO I THINK THEY'RE STILL OPPORTUNITY. OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE INDUSTRY YEAH I THINK WITH THE WITH THE TRADE GROUPS ARE HERE I THINK THAT THEY I THINK THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT THE- DON'T. NUMBER DRESSER. SAY SO THREE. THE HAS AN ADDRESS. YOUR THAT IS FLYING OVERSEAS TO. A LOCATION TO GET- HAVE A VACATION OR BUSINESS WHATEVER AND THEN THEY REALIZE THAT. THEY'RE BOOKING A HOTEL ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE'RE. TRAVEL PLANS VIA AN AIRLINE HAS TO BE INVOLVING A REAL ID BEFORE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET THEIR- SO TO AVOID CANCELLATIONS AND ALL THE HASSLES. GOOD USE OF THE FIRE LINE FROM THE HOTEL COULD THEN. NOTIFY THEM THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE REAL ID WITH- REAL ID DOT DMV WEBSITE I AGREE THIS IN A GENERAL SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH I THINK IF THE IF THE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE BOARD COULD BETTER COMMUNICATE THAT YOU KNOW THIS. WAS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. IN OUR THINKING DE ACTUAL DROP DEAD DATE IS NOT SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH BECAUSE IF I WALK INTO THE DMV ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. THERE'S NO WAY ON WALK OUT WITH THAT RELY DE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE EFFECTIVE DROP DEAD DATE YEAH I MEAN JUST JUST TO MAKE THESE PUT MORE PRESSURE OURSELVES I REALLY THINK EFFECTIVE DROP DEAD IN THE DAY WERE. PLAN IS UP TO THE- THIS ASSUME FOR A SECOND MAYBE THIS SURGE RAIL AT THE END OF THE PERIOD THAT MEANS WERE. A LITTLE BACKLOG ARE. GEN I NOW WE SAY IT. BUSINESS TO GET AWAY GOING HIT THOSE. PEOPLE MOVED. TYPICAL MONTH SO WE THINK SEPTEMBER FIRST IS REALLY THE DROP DEAD DATE FOR PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANT TO TRAVEL ON OCTOBER FIRST IF YOU TO TRAVEL AT THANKSGIVING YOU'RE GONNA TRAVELS OVER THE NEW YEAR'S OUR CHRISTMAS EVE UP MORE TIME RIGHT TO THE HE SAID IN THE INDUSTRY IN THE AIRLINES WOULD KNOW THAT THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR I. D. OR- THE COMPLETION PLEADED. MISSION THEN THAT. EXCEPT MAYBE HAVE A STAYCATION NOT A VAGUE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOUR CALL AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THIS IS SOME SIGNAL THAT THE TUMOR IS NOT GONNA BE. YOU KNOW SUPER SURPRISED WELL AID THAT CANNOT BE FOR PEOPLE TO ENTERPRISE NOT PEOPLE ARE STILL CONCERNED. WELL I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED BECAUSE WAS MENTIONED BY ON THE PANEL RIGHT SO IT'S STILL TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AND EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO COMMUNICATE.
