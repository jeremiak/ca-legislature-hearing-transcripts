DURING THE PAST TWO AND A HALF CENTURIES A MAJORITY OF HUMANITY OVERCAME MAJOR SAYS SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION NOTABLY INHERITED FORMS OF STATUS BASED ON CLASS RACE AND GENDER. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORLD'S PEASANTS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS INTO. A SAID THE CENTER HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT OF MODERN AGE I'VE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THE TRANSFORMATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED NOT ONLY THROUGH FREEDOM STRUGGLES BUT ALSO THROUGH THE MASS MIGRATION THAT BROUGHT. MY PARENTS OUT OF THE SOUTH TO GREATER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. THIS GREAT TRANSFORMATION STILL CONTAIN REYES ORIENT OR IN OR ORIENTATIONS WITH EXTRA. EXTEMPORANEOUS. VISIONS OF A DREAM THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE. FOR FIELD AND A PROMISE OF A LAND THAT HE WOULD NEVER REACH. HIS DREAM AND HIS VISION OF A PROMISED LAND WERE ROOTED AND SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS.

HIS FINAL SPEECH IN MEMPHIS WAS MEANT FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS SEEKING TO BREAK FREE OF THE IMPRESSION OTHER PRESS OF FORCES. THAT CONSTRAIN THEIR LIVES THEIR FREEDOM IN THEIR PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH MARTIN'S VISION HAD EXPANDED BY THE END OF HIS LIFE I COULD SEE THAT THAT DREAM STILL INDOORS IN THE FREEDOM STRUGGLES OF OUR TIME.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AS CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS A WOMAN A MOTHER A DAUGHTER A SISTER AND A WIFE. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL RESOLUTION SENATE RESOLUTION NUMBER. SEVEN SR SEVEN COMMEMORATES THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION WHICH AFFIRM THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL HER REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. AND DECIDE FOR HERSELF NGUYEN AND WITH HOME TO HAVE CHILDREN AND HOW MANY TO HAVE. THAT DECISION HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE IN THE WOMEN'S EQUALITY MOVEMENT AND ITS HELP ADVANCE WOMEN'S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SOCIAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE. OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. TODAY ONE IN FOUR WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES WILL ACCESS ABORTION SERVICES BY THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE NATIONAL PEER REVIEWED STUDIES INCREASINGLY SHOW THAT ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE. DESPITE THE SAFETY AND NEED FOR CONTINUED ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES ROE VERSUS WADE IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY OF BEING OVERTURNED. AND FURTHER A ROAD DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOME STATES CONTINUE TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT CREATES BARRIERS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FOR WOMEN. THE RECENT APPOINTMENTS OF TO US SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT ARE LIKELY NOT SUPPORTIVE OF WOMEN'S RIGHT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE HAS FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THE DANGER THAT ROE VERSUS WADE FACES. LET'S BE CLEAR THESE FIGHTS ARE NOT NEW. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THIS HISTORIC DECISION HAS BEEN UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK BUT THOSE ATTACKS HAVE GAINED A NEW NASTINESS AN ANTI WOMAN TONE UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS WHY IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA STANDS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ROE VERSUS WADE. S. R. SEVEN HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REMAINS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AND ADVANCING. ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR LEYVA MEMBERS WE HAVE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR WE DO SENATOR PAN AND THEN SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS -- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARE SEVEN AND RIGHTS COMMEMORATE GENERATE TWENTY SECOND. NINETEEN AT THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LANDMARK DECISION ROE VERSUS WADE. ROE VERSUS WADE RECOGNIZES THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF EVERY WOMEN TO CONTROL THE REPRODUCTIVE LIVES AND THEIR BY THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WIN IF AND WITH WHOM TO HAVE CHILDREN. PUTTING THESE LIFE ALTERING DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF THE PERSON WHOSE LIVES ARE ALTERED IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND FREEDOM. THIS PERSONAL DECISION SHOULD BE BETWEEN A WOMAN AND HER POSITION WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE. PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY INFORMS US THAT CONTROL OF ONE'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH THROUGH FAMILY PLANNING INCLUDING ABORTION IS CRITICAL FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE FULLY. IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF A DEMOCRACY. THUS I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EVERY WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. AS A CONFIRMED IN ROE VERSUS WADE TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS REGARDING HER PREGNANCY AND COMMIT TO BALL THE ADVANCE ACCESS TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I NEVER TONIGHT BUT THANK YOU CENTER PAN SENATOR RAZA THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HIS STAR. SEVEN FORTY SIX YEARS AGO THIS LANDMARK LEGAL DECISION. TOGETHER WITH THE WAR ON POVERTY AND INCREASED CIVIL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS RESHAPED THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE FOR POOR WOMEN IN AMERICA. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS DIRECTLY LINKED. TO OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES POOR WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS PARTICIPATED IN THE LABOR FORCE IN HIGH NUMBERS. TODAY WOMEN REPRESENT 50% OF THE WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY HALF OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS ARE SUPPORTED BY BREAD WINNER MOTHERS. SO WAS TRUE FIFTY YEARS AGO ANY DAY. THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY. AND OUR COMMUNITIES IS DEPENDENT ON THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND FREEDOM OF ALL WOMEN THANK YOU AND I YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION THINK HE'S MUCH MADAM SENATOR WE HAVE TO OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND DEBATE WE LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR. WIENER IN IN SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM NINETEEN IS FOR THE REST MISTER PRESIDENT. ON COLLEAGUES I RISE AS CHAIR OF THE LGBT CAUCUS AND STRONG SUPPORT ADDRESS OUR SEVEN ON THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND JUSTICE. OFTEN FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE -- HETEROSEXUAL -- THESEISSUES DEEPLY IMPACT THE LGBT COMMUNITY -- AS WELL AND LGBT PEOPLE ARE ALSO AND SIGNIFICANT NEED -- OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES IMPACT THE RATE OF PREGNANCY AMONG ALL THE TO USE -- IS QUITE HIGH -- SO SAYS IMPACTS. EVERYONE. I ALSO WANTED. TO REALLY STRESS THAT RUBY WEIGHED. IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY ISSUES -- IT IS SO IMPORTANT. ENSURING THAT WOMEN CAN ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND MAKE DECISIONS. ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES BECAUSE HONESTLY IT'S NO ONE ELSE'S BUSINESS -- BUT ROW ALSO HELPED LAY THE GROUNDWORK. FOR CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS. FOR LGBT PEOPLE ARE MORE BROADLY. ROE V. WADE REALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR EACH OF US. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES INSTEAD OF HAVING OTHER PEOPLE EMPOWER. MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR US AND SO THE ASSAULT THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY AN ASSAULT THAT HAS CONTINUED OVER THE DECADES AND SEEMS TO GET. MORE AND MORE INTENSE OVER TIME -- IS AN ASSAULT. ON REPORT IT IS A BROADER ASSAULTS ON ALL OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS -- WE MUST NEVER GO BACK AND I IS AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER MEMBERS THAT TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CENTER NúMERO GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. ARE YOU TODAY. YEAH THE FIRST FIVE DIGITS QUICKLY. WANT TO REITERATE AS I HAVE BEFORE. I'M STAUNCHLY BELIEVE THAT -- I'M IN FAVOR. OF PROTECTING OUR BABIES. IN THE WOMB SO -- I I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN IN LIFE WHETHER AT THE BEGINNING. OR IN THE AIR -- AT THE END OF LIFE SO -- SPECIALLY HUMAN BEINGS CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER NOW TO MADAME SENATOR JACKSON'S. IS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AS ONE OF THE OLDER. SENIOR MEMBERS I WANNA STAND AND TALK ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE BEFORE ROE. I WAS ACTUALLY IN COLLEGE. AND I HAD A NUMBER OF FRIENDS. WHO FOUND THEMSELVES WITH UNWANTED UNINTENDED UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES WHO? WOULD GO DOWN TO TIJUANA. AND AT THAT POINT HAVE WHAT WERE THEN LIFE THREATENING PROCEDURES TO END AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY. IN FACT GOING BACK TO THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHERE BEFORE I WAS BORN CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME MIGHT THINK. AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ILLEGAL ABORTIONS WERE PERFORMED ANNUALLY. RESULTING IN BETWEEN EIGHT THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WOMEN'S DEATHS A YEAR. THESE WERE WOMEN WHO WERE OUR DAUGHTERS OR SISTERS OR MOTHERS. THESE ARE WOMEN WHO WERE SO DESPERATE NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED MANY OF THEM COULD NOT FEED THE MILES THAT THEY HAD ALREADY. THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO GO THROUGH WHAT WAS THEN A LIFE THREATENING PROCEDURE NOW. THOSE WHO DIDN'T I BY THE WAY MANY WERE RENDERED STERILE BY BOTCHED PROCEDURES SO THEY COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN. EVEN WHEN AND IF AND WITH WHOM THEY WANTED [inaudible] TODAY ABORTION IS THE MOST COMMON OUTPATIENT SURGICAL PROCEDURE IT IS EIGHT TO TEN TIMES SAFER. THAN GIVING BIRTH. BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT LEGAL. BECAUSE WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THE DECISION WHETHER TO HAVE A CHILD SHOULD BELONG TO THE WOMAN ALONE OR IN CONSULTATION WITH WHOM EVER. SHE SO CHOOSES. THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE. I REMEMBER BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WAS LESS GOVERNMENT IS BETTER GOVERNMENT. TODAY. THERE IS A POLICY THAT SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE. THOSE MOST PERSONAL DECISIONS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE. I FIND THAT TO BE A A DISSONANCE THAT IS VERY HARD. TO OF OVERCOME. TODAY ONE IN FOUR AMERICAN WOMEN WILL HAVE AN ABORTION IN HER LIFETIME. I SUGGESTED PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE. RE OF BIRTH CONTROL ACCESSIBLE THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO IMPROVE. THE RELIABILITY OF BIRTH CONTROL IN THE COURSE OF DECADES. OF I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES WITHIN UNPLANNED UNWANTED PREGNANCY. BUT IT IS THE CHOICE OF WOMEN TO MAKE. AND IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT THE RIGHT. TO DECIDE INTO CHOOSE WAS A RIGHT OF PRIVACY THE BELONG TO EVERY WOMAN. WE SAW WOMEN'S OPPORTUNITIES INCREASE. WOMEN WERE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. THEY WERE ABLE TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY THEY WERE ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS AND I SHOULD JUST SAY THEY ARE SHOULD SAY. PROBABLY EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM EVERY FEMALE IN THIS ROOM. IT'S A CHOICE. IF YOU DON'T WANT. THE TERMINATE A PREGNANCY. AFTER. NO ONE'S MAKING IT BUT NOBODY SHOULD BE FORCED TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY THAT IS ON WANTED AND SO ON THIS FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY. IT REMAINS IMPERATIVE THE PRO CHOICE AMERICANS SEND A MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WE WILL NOT GO BACK TO THE DAYS OF ILLEGAL ABORTION. WHEN WOMEN WERE DYING OF SEPSIS? WHEN CHILDREN WERE NOT LOVED AND CARED FOR BECAUSE THEY WERE ON WANTED? TO A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT A REAL ONE THE RESULT AT AGAIN IN THOUSANDS OF DEATHS OF WOMEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SO. IN KEEPING WITH THE TRADITION OF THE OLD DAYS. I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUATION. A WHAT WE SAID BACK IN THE DAY THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE LATE ARE SHOULD BE SAFE. LEGAL. AND RARE. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR MORLOCK MISTER SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THAT LIFE IS BUILT [inaudible] AND I'M THANKFUL THAT -- WOMEN ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS. WHICH PROVIDE WOMEN WITH PREGNANCY TESTING PRENATAL VITAMINS PARENTING CLASSES AND OTHER SERVICES. AND THEY REPRESENT A FREE SPEECH OPPORTUNITY AND WE SHOULD OPPOSE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NON PROFITS THAT GIVES. LIFE AFFIRMING OPTIONS TO WOMEN FACING UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES THE TOP ISSUE MISTER CHAIR MISTER PRESIDENT WE WANT TO KEEP IT RARE. BUT AT LEAST THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS WE JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SIR. MEMBERS WE HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL MICROPHONE UP THAT SENATOR MITCHELL AND IT WILL TURN OVER TO SENATOR LEYVA [inaudible] TO CLOSE [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. TOP OF THE AFTERNOON TO YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I STAND AS I DO EVERY YEAR IN FAVOR OF THE RESOLUTION THAT COMMEMORATES THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT RULING THIS YEAR THAN TO LAY THIS S. R.. SEVEN BECAUSE I TOO AM IN FAVOR OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND MY VOTING RECORD -- ON THIS FLOOR PROVES THAT. BECAUSE I VOTED TO SUPPORT FUNDING GOING TO REDUCING THE BLACK INFANT MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. I VOTED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. I CONTINUE TO VOTE TO GUARANTEE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE ACTUALLY GET IT. I VOTE TO SUPPORT -- AND MAKE SURE THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CONTINUES TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SERVICES LIKE PREVENTIVE CANCER SCREENING AND THE MYRIAD OF SERVICES THEY PROVIDED MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. IN MANY COMMUNITIES THAT -- PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED TO FIND THOSE VERY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND TRAGICALLY IF I WERE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN IN DC I WOULD CERTAINLY VOTE TO IN THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE CAL FRESH BENEFITS. FEED. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I TOO AM IN FAVOR OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THIS WE CAN -- NOT ONLY IS IT THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE BUT WE COMMEMORATED DR KING'S BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY. AND I'M SURE ALL OF US HAD MARCHES AND FESTIVITIES ACROSS OUR DISTRICTS. AND I READ JUST THIS MORNING AT THE MARCH A UNIQUE GROUP PARTICIPATING. IT WAS A GROUP OF ANTI CHOICE AT THE KIDS WHO ARE HOLDING UP SIGNS THAT SAID BLACK LIVES MATTER. SUGGESTING THAT ABORTION WAS THE GREATEST THREAT TO BLACK CHILDREN. WELL AS A BLACK WOMAN I RESENT THAT. AS A BLACK MOTHER I RESENT THAT AND THOSE STATISTICS CERTAINLY DON'T BRING THAT BACK TO BEAR. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THE TIME TO REMIND ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM WHAT ARE THE LOOMING THREATS TO BLACK CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT RESTING BELIEVE TRUST AND BELIEVE. IT'S NOT A BLACK WOMAN EXERCISING HER FUNDAMENTAL. CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO CHOOSE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IN WIND BRINGS A CHILD INTO THE WORLD. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS ONCE AGAIN I PROUDLY STAND IN SUPPORT. OF THE S. R.. SEVEN THANK YOU SENATOR. IF WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR LAST CALL FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. HEARING C. NINE CENTER LEYVA YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.
