THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US AND I APOLOGIZE THAT WE'RE STARTING A BIT LATE. WELCOME TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. WITH ACTIVATED TAKE CARE OF SOME HOUSEKEEPING AS A SUB COMMITTEE UNTIL WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WE HAVE ONE ITEM ON CONSENT TODAY THAT'S ITEM SIXTEEN SB. SIX THIRTY SEVEN ITEM EIGHT SP TWO FORTY ONE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE AGENDA [inaudible] ITEM. SIX ITEM SIX WHICH IS SB ONE EIGHTY TWO CENTER JACKSON WILL BE UNABLE TO PRESENT TODAY. I'LL BE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF SENATOR JACKSON'S. AND WITNESSES HAVE A HEART OUT. JUST PRIOR TO LIVE IN AM SO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE A PRESENT THAT BILL ROUND TEN FIFTEEN TEN THIRTY ISHE. ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH THIS COMMITTEE HAS THIRTY ONE BILLS IN FRONT OF IT. ON MAY FIRST FIFTEEN BILLS. AND IF WE GO PAST ONE O'CLOCK OR HEAD ON OVER TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY UNLESS MSS LANE CHESTER'S READY TO GO RIGHT MASLEN CHESTER SHE'S REAL. AND NOT ONE I'D TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE TEAM. THERE ARE SEVERAL BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED TODAY AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE HARD WORK. THEY GENERALLY GET RIGHT INTO IT ON SB THIRTEEN CENTER AYE CASKET I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE ON ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. THROUGH A CASKET THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND I APOLOGIZE WE HAVE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'S ALL RIGHT -- SB THE AYE THIRTEEN HAS BEEN SLIMMED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM LAST YEAR'S SB. EIGHT THREE ONE WE FREE MOVED TO REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO FLOOR AREA RATIO SETBACKS AND TO LOT SIZES TOO SO EVERYBODY'S CLEAR ABOUT THIS I'VE AGREED TO REMOVE THESE I IT'S NOT THAT IT'S IT'S IN THAT MISSION BY ME THAT THESE ARE NOT IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT THEY NOW REMAIN BARRIERS. BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF NEGOTIATION GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT EIGHT THREE ONE FACE LAST YEAR'S AND MAKING THAT MOVE. HOWEVER THIS THIS BILL STILL PRODUCES DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES ELIMINATES HOMEOWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS -- ADDRESSING WHAT THAT -- H. C. D.. THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT -- THE AGENCY SAID IN A RECENT SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE EIGHTY YOU HEARING WITH THE TOP TWO ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESS. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT STUDIES FROM PLACES SUCH AS THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ AND UC BERKELEY THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES ARE EXCESSIVELY HIGH FOR EIGHTY USE. FOR INSTANCE THE UC BERKELEY FOUND THAT SOME WILL KILL THESE ARE CHARGING AS MUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T INCLUDE THE IMPACT FEES CHARGED BY UTILITY DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND AND OTHER DISTRICTS IT'S A WONDER WERE WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON PERMITTED EIGHTY USE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY HOMEOWNERS THAT WANT TO BUILD EIGHTY USE ARE STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WHEN THEY'RE HANDED THESE FEES EIGHTY USER BUILT ON LOTSA ALREADY HAVE PAID DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES HE SAID IT AGAIN THEY'VE ALREADY PAID THE DEVELOPMENT AND FOR IMPACT FEES. HOMEOWNER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THEM AGAIN ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE HOMEOWNER CAN EXPAND THEIR HOME FOR A BEDROOM OF THE KITCHEN A BATHROOM. WHERE THEY PAY -- ZERO DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES I THINK I TESTIFIED LAST YEAR MISTER CHAIR THAT -- MY WIFE SEE WHEN I BUILT A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SQUARE FOOT ADDITION WE ADDED THE BATHROOM WE EXPANDED. THE BEDROOM AND WE ADDED THE SECOND STOVE AND WE PAID NOTHING GOES A MINISTERIAL ONE DAY EVENT. SB -- THIRTEEN PROHIBITS HOME OCCUPANCY ORDINANCES WHICH REQUIRED THE OWNER TO LIVE AND EITHER THE EIGHTY YOU ARE THE PRIMARY UNIT WE DON'T DO THIS AND DUPLEXES TRI PLEX IS. FOR PLEXUS. APARTMENTS THERE'S AN UNFOUNDED FEAR THAT INVESTORS ARE BUYING UP THESE HOUSES AND JUST TO BUILD EIGHTY USED TO RENT THEM OUT. IN REALITY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MAJORITY OF A THE USER BUILT BY HOMEOWNERS THE HOUSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THE CITY OF PORTLAND IN THE STUDY AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT OF TWELVE HUNDRED EIGHTY USE ONLY THAT STIRS I WOULD SUBMIT MISTER CHAIR IT'S A RED HERRING -- MOON OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS LIVE LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF EIGHTY USE AND PREVENT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEM I HAVE I KNOW THAT THE STAFF TO ITS IS TO NOT ACCEPT -- BACKGROUND I HAVE LETTERS FROM BANKS TO SAYING THEY WILL NOT LAN TO TO TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE INTO POSITION IN FACT IF THERE'S A FORECLOSURE THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE OCCUPANCY OF THE HOUSE. THERE'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE FOUR LARGEST CITIES IN NORTH AMERICA WITH THE GREATEST GROWTH AND EIGHTY USE OUR CITIES THAT PROHIBIT OWNER OCCUPANCY. IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS WE DO AND WE'RE DOING TWO THINGS WE'RE RATHER DISCOURAGING HOME OWNERS FROM ASSISTING US IN HELPING HOUSING CRISIS OVER IN COURAGE AND PEOPLE TO BUILD THESE UNITS WITHOUT A PERMIT. WITH ME TODAY IS -- TAMARA CISNEROS WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SENATOR MRS HARRIS WE WELCOME YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THE MORNING SEE WHAT IS CENTERS WITH BERRY COUNCIL A NONPROFIT PUBLIC PROBABLY POLICY ORGANIZATION. ADVOCATING FOR VARIOUS ISSUES FIRST OUR ECONOMY AND A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE -- AS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF MOSTLY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BECAUSE HE THE COALITION AS SEE WHY COALITION FOR THOSE ADVOCATING FOR EXCESS RETELLING UNITS. OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE CONTINUES TO DRIVE OF HOUSING CRISIS ADDRESSING A SHORTFALL OF THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES WITHIN SEVEN YEARS SOUNDS DON TEEN. BUT IF ANYTHING THIS REQUIRES US TO TAKE AMBITIOUS BOLD ACTION. YES SEVERAL BARRIERS T OVERCOME BUT WE SHOULDN'T UNDERESTIMATE EIGHTY USE AND SB THIRTEEN TO PROVIDE A VIABLE SOLUTION TO OUR WHERE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY USE OUR FOR WILL BY DESIGN THE COST LESS TO BUILD AND RAN FOR LESS. ACCORDING TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TURNER CENTER REPORT ALMOST 60% OF EIGHTY YOU OWNERS RIGHT TO THEIR UNITS AT BELOW MARKET RATES. AND THE ENTRY TO MARKET IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. THE MAJORITY OF HOMES AND CALIFORNIA ARE SINGLE FAMILY RESEARCH FROM UC BERKELEY SHOWED THAT 31% OF BAY AREA HOME OWNERS WOULD BUILDING EIGHTY YOU IF IT WAS FEASIBLE. AND THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT NINE MILLION IF JUST 10% OF THOSE NINE MILLION HOMES WERE TO BUILDING EIGHTY YOU THAT WOULD DELIVER. NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOUSING TO OUR STOCK. NO OTHER HOUSING SOLUTION OUT THERE. HAS THIS LEVEL OF SCALABILITY AND ONLY SCALE CAN SOLVE THIS CRISIS. ALTHOUGH WE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN LOWERING AT RESTRICTIONS WITH PASSAGE OF SB TEN SIXTY NINE WHICH WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB THIRTEEN BUILT ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS. AND TAXIS ARE MAJOR BURDEN FOR THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER AND ARE DESIGNED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT TRIGGER INCREASE SERVICES AND UTILITIES. THAT 25% CHARGE FOR EIGHTY USE OVER CENTER FIFTY SQUARE FEET IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE FOR BOTH AGENCIES AND HOMEOWNER. AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT 25% OF NOTHING IS NOTHING SO IF WE PUT THE IMPACT FEE TOO HIGH THEN IT'S JUST GOING TO ENCOURAGE A BLACK MARKET. THIRTY SECONDS. OKAY. I ALSO JUST WANT TO ECHO THE GOOD POINT ABOUT ON OCCUPANCY BEING ON AND NECESSARY -- DETERRENT THERE'S A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES TWO MILLION OF THOSE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE -- RENTER OCCUPIED. THIS WILL LEGISLACIÃ³N WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES TO CALIFORNIA'S HOW THE STARK. FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB. THIRTY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISSUS S. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP TO THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. THE WELCOMING COMMITTEE FOR SOME LASSEN ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ERIN EVENTS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA A AND B. AND SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SEVENTH GIVE OUR BEST TO THE CENTER PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MORNING DENISE PINKSTON ON BEHALF OF THE CASITA COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SENATOR CASKEY FOR YOUR LEADERS. THANK YOU. SELECT A LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED TO PLEASE COME FORWARD LAST CALL FOR SUPPORT. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED TO COULD PLEASE COME FOR DIFFERENT TWO SEATS. WE'LL HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS. AS WELL AS A SECONDARY WITNESS. WHO'S GONNA LEADER'S OFFICE OUR PRIMARY WITNESS INDIVIDUAL HAS FIVE MINUTES SECONDARIES TWO MINUTES WHO'D LIKE TO ITALY TO SOFT. LADIES FIRST HATED SO TAKE FIVE MINUTES THAT'S ALL THAT WE WELCOME IF YOU COULD PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THANK YOU I'M LAWRENCE EVELYN SEAT REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND WE DO HAVE OPPOSE UNLESS SUBMIT AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL I WANT TO START OUT BY THANKING US SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY FOR SLIMMING DOWN. ON WHAT WAS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT -- AND ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT AP CALIFORNIA IS NOT OPPOSED TO EIGHTY USE WE I DO SUPPORT AT IS ON A REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- BUT WE DO. FOR TODAY I'LL FOCUS ON OWNER OCCUPANCY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE REMOVAL OF ON OUR OCCUPANCY WRIST RAT RESTRICTIONS THAT CAN BE APPLIED -- NOT BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE A BARRIER TO EIGHTY USE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT CAN HELP ENCOURAGE AFFORDABILITY FOR EIGHTIES. I'M CURRENTLY AN EXISTING OTHERS NOTHING THAT REQUIRES EIGHTY USED TO BE AFFORDABLE HOWEVER AS I SAID I THINK HONOR OCCUPANCY CAN BE ONE TOOL THAT JURISDICTION'S CAN USE TO HELP ENCOURAGE THAT. THE HOMEOWNER IS LIKELY MORE LIKELY TO RENT OUT THERE AT YOU AT AN AFFORDABLE RENT -- AND REMOVING -- OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS -- DOES CONCERN APA WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND OTHERS TO COME IN AND POTENTIALLY RENT TODD -- TO EXCUSE ME BY A PROPERTY AT AN EIGHTY YOU UP BY A PROPERTY WITH AN EIGHTY YOU AND RENT OUT BILLS FOR WHATEVER THE MARKET WERE WELL THERE AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED -- THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS REMOVED -- ON TOP OF THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY OR THE EIGHTY USE DO NOT -- HAVE MANY OF THE OTHER DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THAT -- DUPLEXES TRI PLEX IS AND ALL OF THOSE UNITS TO HAVE -- AND THEN POTENTIALLY IF THEY HAVE REDUCED OR NO IMPACT FEES THERE'S REALLY A BIG INCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPERS TO COME IN AND DO THIS -- AND WE ALSO AS I MENTIONED KNOW THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO USE -- OWNER OCCUPANCY AS WAY TO ENCOURAGE -- AFFORDABILITY FOR EXAMPLE SANTA ROSA WAVES OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS IF THERE'S A DEED RESTRICTION FOR A ABILITY ON THE UNIT. SO -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH THE FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT HAVE COME IN PLACE WITH OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE THE BERRIER -- FOR HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO ADD AN EIGHTY YOU. WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WOULD STILL ALLOW SOME PARAMETERS AROUND ON YOUR OCCUPANCY WITHOUT COMPLETELY REMOVING THEM -- BUT FOR THOSE REASONS RIGHT NOW WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US WHY THE WHOLE THERE WE WALKING A LITTLE LEAGUE HELPING CITIES YES THANK YOU SIR MEMBERS CHAIRED JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE CONCERNS ON THE EPA'S MENTIONED -- BUT WE DO. YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE SENATOR SCALING HIS BILL BACK AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CENTER FOR YEARS NOW ON THIS ISSUE ON THE LEAGUE CERTAINLY IS NOT OPPOSED EIGHTY USING THESE ARE IMPORTANT TOOL FOR MANY OF OUR CITIES TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY. WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL THAT IS IN PRINT BEFORE YOU NOW AND REALLY IT'S THE IMPACT FEE PIECE IT IS A IS A MAJOR HURDLE FOR US -- WE ALWAYS GONNA BE MINDFUL THAT THESE IMPACT FEES ARE CHARGED THEY HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH MITIGATION FEE ACT I'M WHICH HIGHLY REGULATE HOW CITIES CHARGES FEES ARE SB NEXUS STUDY WE CAN ONLY CHARGE FOR THE THE SERVICE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DELIVER. CITIES CANNOT MAKE MONEY ON THESE FEES THEY DON'T GO TO OUR GENERAL FUND THEY DON'T YOU KNOW HELP WITH OTHER SERVICES OTHER THAN THE SERVICE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING BASED ON THE IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY. AND IT'S IT WE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IF PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS IS AN AFFORDABLE OPTION THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE IS IMPACT FEES BECAUSE THEY'RE TO DEMAND A SERVICE -- SO THE FEES ISSUES IS A MAJOR CONCERN AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD HOPE THAT MAYBE WE GET POSITIVE CASH ON FEES UNTIL THE REPORT COMES OUT JULY. ONE MACD IS GONNA ISSUED A REPORT ON FEES MITIGATION FEE ACT AND WE'LL SEE A WHOLE HOST I BELIEVE OF OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THIS BODY I'M TO PERHAPS CHANGE THE MITIGATION FEE ACT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY CHANGES BE DONE IN THE ACT ITSELF. AND NOT A PIECEMEAL BASIS FOR EIGHTY USE PARTICULARLY. THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THE PROHIBITION ON REPLACEMENT PARKING RIGHT NOW WE CANNOT IMPOSE PARKING REQUIREMENTS ON ANY DO YOU IF YOU'RE WITH A HALF MILE OF TRANSIT. THIS TAKES AN ADDITIONAL STEP IN SAYS IF YOU CONVERT A GARAGE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PLACE THOSE PARKING SPOTS SO WE'VE YOU THIS IS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON NO PARKING ON WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVE ANY ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND FOR THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED MUST AMENDED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED TO COULD PLEASE COME MIKE FROM FIRST LASSEN ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING. MORNING CRINGE ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. IN THE LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME WE WELCOME ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSE LAST CALL. CURRENCY NUMBER LIKE BETTER BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR IN THE UNABLE TO BE A VOTE ON THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LACK OF CORM UNINSURED OVER CENTER BALLOT ADEQUATE COMING. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SENATOR LIKE HOUSE KEY IN THE OTHERS RESPOND TO THE MITIGATION ACT. AND THE STUDY. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE FEES FOR ISSUES. FOR THREE YEARS NOW [inaudible] SO -- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO MAKE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ME I'M KIND OF IN PATIENT IN MY JOB HERE I LIKE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND MOVE ON SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY THERE'S A STUDY COMING UP I'M SERVE LIKE SKEPTICAL. OKAY. SO CAN YOU CAN YOU RESPOND. TO WE I ASKED MY STAFF TO CALL EACH CD THIS MONTH TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE STUDY AND HOW IT WAS GOING IN H. C. D. SURPRISINGLY SAYS THAT. EIGHTY USE WERE NOT IN THE SCOPE OF THE SURVEY THE THE TIM GRAYSON BILL THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS JUST LOOKING AN IMPACT FEES ARE BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION AND WHETHER THE IMPACT FEES THAT THEY THEY SAY THERE'S A NEXUS BETWEEN THE RECREATION. DEVELOPMENT IN THE PARKS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT FEES AND THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE. A RECOMMENDATION AND EIGHTY USE IN THE THE STUDY THAT'S COMING OUT IN JUNE SO WE'VE BEEN. I HEARD THAT LAST YEAR WITH EIGHT THREE ONE AND HERE IN IT THIS YEAR AND NOBODY'S CALLED UP EIGHT CD AND SAID A SECOND BE INCLUDED SO THEY'RE NOT GETTING CLUED. THE IMPACT FEES WE DO KNOW THAT THE TURNER CENTER IS DOING SOME WORK FOR EIGHT CD ON THIS THEY'RE DOING A LARGE LARGE PORTION OF THE STUDY AND AND TURNER CENTER HAS INDOORS. SB THIRTEEN THEY'VE THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT STUDIES THAT THEY PUT OUT THAT THE DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES ARE EXCESSIVE WITH THE EIGHTY YEAR NOW THAT AGAIN. WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT IN THE IN THE IN THE STUDY. OKAY OF THE WHY WAIT. SO SO THE THE THE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DEBATING ISSUE FOR AWHILE YOU KNOW -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY FURTHER STUDIES ON LIKE LIKE I THINK I TOLD YOU THE LAST HEARING WE HAD ON YOUR BILL LAST TIME. OF IN SAN JOSE ESSENTIALLY WITH THE WAY WE VIEW IT IS THERE'S A LOT OF AID YOU IS ALREADY OUT THERE. EXCEPT THEIR SHOCKS GARAGES CONVERTED. ALL THE ILLEGAL WIRE RAN ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTION ON NOT REGULATED -- THE WHOLE CITIES FOR THE SO CALLED EIGHTY USE IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT BUT THEY'RE JUST. OVERCROWDED HOUSING THAT. HAS BEEN BUILT AND WITHOUT ANY PERMITS. WHICH BECOME FIRE HAZARDS AND SO FORTH -- HAVE YOU IS ANYBODY -- LOOKED AT THAT ANGLE BECAUSE I TAKE ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL WOULD BE. TO TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF LEGALIZING SUMMER pALREADY OUT THERE THAT WE CAN CONFORM TO THE LAW AND MAYBE. INSPECTIONS COULD CLEAR UP SOME OF THE WIRING DEFICIENCIES THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR YES. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES AND HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT THE THIRD PRONG ISN'T THE AMNESTY PROGRAM AND IT'S A HIT SAID PRICE WITH PRECISELY THIS WE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE. NONE PERMITTED UNITS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS THE WORKING NUMBER THE PEOPLE USING THROUGHOUT THE CITY SO THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THERE. IS SOME OF THOSE ARE UNINHABITABLE AND WE GET THAT AFTER FIRE DANGER OR THREAT BUT SOME OF THEM ARE JUST TO NOT MAKE. BUILDING CODES BUT THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE BUILT THEY WERE WORSE WORKERS SETS WERE SENDING UP THIS TEN YEAR PROGRAM WE CAN WE CAN GO THROUGH AND ALLOW PEOPLE. TO TO LEGALIZE AND THERE IS ANOTHER LEGISLATION THAT WOULD SET WOULD INSTRUCT -- STANDARDS TO BE MADE FOR EIGHTY USE IN PARTICULAR AND I ARE SEPARATELY IN PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH CHILD -- TWENTY FOUR WITH THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IT'S IT'S IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD BUT THE THE REAL BAD STUFF IS GOING TO BE LET THE CITIES IN THE HOMEOWNERS WORK WITH IT. TO TO GET HIM UP -- TO MARKETABILITY. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE USE -- COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FEDERAL MONEY. TO TO DO SOME CODE ENFORCEMENT BUILDING REAL BILL. OF ACTIVITIES LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. AND PROPOSITION ONE THAT JUST PASSED BY THE VOTERS -- ALLOWS THAT KIND OF FUNDING. OF FOR CITIES TO COME IN AND AND USE -- PROP ONE PROCEEDS FOR REHABILITATION. CODE COMPLIANCE. THE MORE CO COMPLIANCE WE CAN GET TO SAY FOR COMMUNITIES HAVE OUT WILL BE CALM I THINK THAT'S SO IN TERMS OF LIKE EIGHTY USE IF THERE. IS A SENSE THAT THERE IS -- IN IN CITIES LIKE SAN JOSE I KNOW IT'S TRUE I ASSUME IT MIGHT BE TRUE IN OTHER CITIES -- A LOT OF THESE ILLEGAL STRUCTURES THAT WE WANT TO BRING IN. AND TURN INTO LEGAL STRUCTURES. OF MAYBE THE CITIES AND THE PLANNERS CAN COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK EIGHTY YOU LAW. WOULD FACILITATE. CO COMPLIANCE AND BUILDING APPLICATIONS TO REHAB SOME AND AND AND FIX UP SOME OF THESE. STRUCTURES THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE SURE ABSOLUTELY DECENTLY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS LIKE YOU MENTIONED WHERE THERE YOU KNOW AND AND PROP ONE WE'RE GONNA SEE DOLLARS TO HELP A FOLKS COME AT YOU KNOW OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND ACTUALLY GET THEIR THEIR UNITS PERMITTED THAT'S SOMETHING WE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGING WE'VE SUPPORTED ON BILLS IN THE PAST THAT HAVE THAT HAVE DONE THAT -- SO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING MORE WE CAN DO ON THAT WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THESE -- YOU KNOW THESE UNITS UPDATED AND CODE COMPLIANT AND YOU KNOW BUT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT EFFORT ON THE BUTTONS OF PLANNERS HAVE SLIGHTLY FOR THE A. B. AS WELL IT WAS MORE THAN A PERSONAL. IF YOU IF YOU SUPPORT THAT MAYBE MAYBE THE IDEA OF FOR A LOT OF US STATE YOU DO WE LOOK AT IT AS AN ARGUMENT [inaudible] FOR THE BILL. YOU KNOW OF GOING TO THE CITIES COMING FROM A FORMER. CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND SALAS A YOU SHOULD BE. FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP COPE COMPLIANCE. AND REDUCING THE ILLEGAL WIRING ESPECIALLY THE FIRE HAZARDS YOU KNOW. VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION OUT THERE AND WHEN THE FEES ARE SO HIGH PEOPLE JUST GO AHEAD AND DO THESE ILLEGAL -- THAT'S THAT'S A COMMON WAY THAT PEOPLE DO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IS THEY FEEL THAT. WHY BOTHER GOING TO GET IT? YEAH THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A LITTLE. ADDITION THEY WANT TO HAVE SO. SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE TO DRIVE SEVENTY MILES TO GET TO THEIR JOBS SO THEY THE BILL THE LITTLE. THING IN THE BACKYARD OR YOU KNOW IT IT IT TURNS OUT IS ILLEGAL AND LATER ON SOME HAPPENS THERE'S A FIRE AND SOMEBODY. SO. I I'M JUST ARGUING -- IN A SENSE SAID THE BILL IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A COLD COMPLIANCE. KIND OF THING FOR FOR ME AND THEREFORE. HAS A PUBLIC GOODS AND IF IT HAS A PUBLIC GOOD MAYBE THE THE SHOULD BE -- AT SOME POINT LOWER THAN. IN A JUST A NORMAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THANKS IN ABOUT MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS REGARD TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. HOW MANY UNITS HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY CONVERTED AND HOW THAT PUTS THE PUBLIC SAFETY -- AT RISK. IN HAVING THAT AND THIS YOU'D BETTER BRING THEM IN. AND BEING ABLE TO BUILD LEGALLY THERE ARE REGULATED MARKET IN THE FUTURE. SENATE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY GRATEFUL IN. REALLY GOOD POINTS. I'M LIKELY TO SEE IF CENTER NIELSEN HAVE ANY ITEMS ON THIS ITEM THE ONLY ITEM I WILL SAY IS THAT -- WHEN I APPRECIATE? THE GOOD SENATOR FOR FREE MINDS WORK ON THIS ISSUE HE'S BEEN A CHAMPION ON THIS -- AND HAS BEEN LEADING THE SENATE ON ALL ISSUES OF EXCESS OR DWELLING UNITS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'LL BRING. WE HAD A AN ABILITY TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT FEES IN THIS COMMITTEE INTENTIONALLY IS NOT. COMMENTING ON FEES WITHIN THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS A SENATOR WHO KNOWS WHO'S GONNA HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE FEES HERE.

LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT LAST CALL. WE NOW LIKELY TO WELCOME ANYONE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRIMARY WITNESSES WHO ARE OPPOSED. WITH THIS CARE CAN CATHOLIC CITIES MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND IS HERE TODAY. I HE'S GONNA HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND WE WILL WELCOME A SECONDARY WITNESS AT TWO MINUTES IF YOU CARED FOR AS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SIR GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID TANK YOU'RE GONNA BE HELPFUL TO GET CALIFORNIA CITIES WITH CONCERNS AT THIS POINT -- OUR POLICY COMMITTEE DID LOOK AT THIS BILL AND HAS A OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION. BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED WERE ABOARD. WE APPRECIATE MEETING WITH NOT ONLY THE AUTHOR STUFF BUT ALSO REPRESENTS FROM THE TREASURER'S OFFICE -- THE WE WE ARE HERE TO TO TALK ABOUT THE MERITS OF THE PROGRAM -- THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEIR SAID THAT IN ALICE'S SO TOUCHES ON NOT -- WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE ANALYSIS IT KIND OF BREAKS DOWN HOW THE SALES TAXES IS DIVVIED UP IN THE STATE. AND IF YOU LOOK EVERYTHING BELOW THE FIRST LINE IS IS OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED EITHER THERE THE BRADLEY BURNS AGO TO CITIES -- OR WHICH ALSO NOT MISSING WHAT'S MISSING ON THIS LIST IS THE TRANSACTION USE TAXES APPROVED BY LOCAL VOTERS AT ALSO -- OR COLLECTED LOCALLY BUT THE STATE HAS -- ALLOCATED A SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO COUNTIES FOR REALIGNMENT FROM THE SALES TAX -- INSULT AS WELL AS LOCALS THIS IS A CUTE REVENUE SOURCE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ARE HAS A READ A REPORT IN DECEMBER. THAT POINTED OUT THE OUT OF BECAUSE THE STATE HAS. CONTINUE THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE PARTIAL MANUFACTURERS EXEMPTION MANY OF THESE SAME COMPANIES COULD CAN NOW ALL OF THAT THAT. THAT EXEMPTION WASN'T HERE AT THE TIME THE THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED MANY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM COULD. COULD SORT OF SIMPLY BENEFIT FROM THE STATE'S PROGRAM. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF THIS PROGRAM IS IS EXTENDED AND IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- FOR FOR TEN YEARS. SO ABOUT POTENTIALLY AT AT FULL BUILD OUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF IMPACT IS REALLY GONNA BE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE IN AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO ANALYZE THIS PROGRAM IN TERMS OF A AFFECTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THERE'S NOT A REAL NEXUS IN THIS IN THIS -- INCENTIVE BETWEEN THE BENEFITING COMMUNITY AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING BYE BYE -- FORFEITING THEIR THEIR SALES TAXES IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE THE CITY OF FREMONT -- AND YOU FELT OF TESTS LÃ  AND THEY RECEIVE LOTS OF BENEFITS ARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF JOBS AND OTHER THINGS -- IN IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT YOU COULD SAY ARE CERTAINLY OFFSETTING WHATEVER WHATEVER FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION BUT THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET UP THERE THERE ISN'T REALLY A NEXUS BETWEEN THE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S GETTING THAT ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING THE JOBS. AND THOSE WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS COMING FROM -- IN SO WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK ON THIS BILL TO SEE IF WITH THERE'S A WAY TO TO TIGHTEN UP THE NEXUS BETWEEN -- THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THIS -- IS A AND AND AND AND THE PROGRAM -- FOR THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD A SLOW DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY WENT THROUGH WENT THROUGH. IT WAS - VERY WENT WENT VERY QUICKLY THERE WASN'T MUCH IN THE WAY OF HEARINGS AND AND THE THE IMPACTS OF OF THIS ON LOCAL BUT WE'RE NEVER REALLY ANALYZED SO THIS TIME AROUND I THINK IT WOULD GIVEN THE THE THAT THE LA OWES -- ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S GOING TO SHOULDER THE THE THE FINANCIAL WAY TO THIS PROGRAM -- IT'S WORTH A TAKEN OUT TAKE A LOOK AT SO WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR. ON THESE ISSUES AS THE BILL MOVES. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU IF YOU'RE OKAY IF YOU WANNA HANG THERE WITH US IN CASE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE THAT WILL GIVE THE SENATOR IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TIME TO RESPOND. LIKELY TO SEE IF WE HAVE A SECONDARY WITNESS ON THIS ISSUE THERE'S A SECONDARY WITNESS AN INDIVIDUAL OF TWO MINUTES -- AS FAR AS THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME AID -- ARE YOU HERE FOR OPPOSITION MA'AM NO ALL RIGHT TO SWITCHING OUT ALRIGHT HERE WE GO NOW WE'D LIKE TO GET TO GO TO ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE ASKING ANYONE ELSE PLEASE STAND FIRST AND LAST NAME IN ORGANIZATION. LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION. THIS IS GONNA BE LAST CALL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WITH THAT WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR BELL. IF YOU TAKE THE TOTAL -- SALES TAX WHAT'S THE COST IS ANYBODY FIGURE THAT OUT. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY. IS A QUESTION -- HOW MUCH SALES TAX HAS BEEN EXCLUDED OVER TIME YEAH WHAT WEALTHY PASSES FOR THE AND THAT'S A LOOK IF WE PASS THIS BILL WHAT WOULD BE THOUGH? AND THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE PROGRAM IS A LIMITED TO IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES TAX EXCLUSION TO AWARD EACH YEAR. OF THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT PROBABLY GETS -- USE SO IT'S NOT FUNDS THAT WE'RE GIVING AWAY IT'S JUST FUNDS WERE NOT COLLECTING. SO IT'S THAT SPENDS IT ON A QUICK MATT THAT'S PURCHASED OVER THREE TO FIVE YEARS -- AND NOT ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES WILL USE ALL OF THEIR WORDS AND BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS THERE TO AND CENTS NASCENT TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW COMPANIES. SOME AWARDS DON'T END UP BEING USE SO THERE IS A LIMIT OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AND SALES AND USE TAXES LOSING EACH YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT SENT TO THE ST IMPACT YOUR THAT IS A COMBINED STATE AND LOCAL. THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT EIGHT POINT STATE AND LOCAL BECAUSE DIFFERENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT TAX RATES OKAY IMAGES AND IF IT'S OKAY IF WE CAN HAVE MISTER CURSING FROM LA AS OFFICE PLEASE COME FOR EXITING THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME INDEPENDENT HOUSES ON THAT AS WELL IF THAT'S OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT. IT'S CRISTINA I KNOW I'M GIVING US -- YOUR LAST NAME HE DOES INTERVIEWS YOURSELF IN YOUR OLD L. A. L. A. AND ADDRESSING REBELS A COMMON QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS A SET CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO -- SO AS AS A KID FOR REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THERE IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL. CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE. THE AMOUNT OF EXCLUSIONS THAT CAN BE AWARDED IN ANY GIVENYEAR AS WE DESCRIBE IN OUR ANALYSIS IN OUR IN IN A REPORT FROM DECEMBER -- US QUITE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT LIKELY WOULD BE -- CLAIMED ANYWAY THROUGH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO REALLY THE NET -- REVENUE A FAX FROM A STATE GENERAL FUND STANDPOINT LIKELY IS. IS FAIRLY SMALL AND AND REALLY IT'S IT'S IT'S MOSTLY WE WE WOULD MOSTLY HIGHLIGHT A SORT OF ON THE REVENUE FOREGONE REVENUE SIDE -- THE FOR GONE LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUES THAT THAT -- THE LEAGUE OF CITIES REPRESENTATIVE REFERENCE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN TOTAL OF UP. TO ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR THAT ASSUMES. THAT WOULD ASSUME FOR FULL UTILIZATION WHICH IS PROBABLY. UNREALISTIC SO PROBABLY IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT PERHAPS SOMEWHERE IN THE IN THE MADE TENS OF OF MILLIONS PER YEAR. WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER FOR THE STATE GENERAL FUND. ON IT'S SO WE DIDN'T HAVE DATA THAT WERE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE X. FULL EXTENT OF THE OERLAP BETWEEN THE PARTIAL EXEMPTION IN THE IN THE CASE FOR EXCLUSION -- BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE GATHERED WE THINK IT'S QUITE LARGE SO YOU COULD REASONABLY ASSUME THE GENERAL FUND IMPACT IS IN THE MILLIONS TO MAYBE. IT JUST JUST PROBABLY MAYBE SEVERAL MILLION TO PERHAPS TEN MILLION A YEAR. IF I CAN CLARIFY ONE THING IN OUR AFTER THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO CLARIFY -- BUT WE HAVE WORKED WITH BOTH DÃ¢N AND SAT IN THEIR ANALYSIS AND AND CONCERNS OVER THE PROGRAM -- I WOULD THINK IN IN LIGHT OF THE LA OWES REPORT -- THE SIMPLIFICATION THAT THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE SIMILAR -- I WOULD SAY IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION I'M SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED HE WAS ACTUALLY HAVE FULLY AWARDED. THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH CALENDAR YEAR THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECTED WE EXPECTED THAT WHEN THERE WAS A PURE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM PROVIDED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND NOT ONE THAT REQUIRED A NET BENEFIT NOT. AS I'VE BEEN TOLD A RIGOROUS EVALUATION THAT REQUIRES FEES IN PROACTIVE NESS -- THAT WE WOULD STILL BE ACTIVE AND THERE'S TO BE A DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM WHAT WE ARE FINDING IS THAT THE VOLATILITY IN THE INDUSTRY AND SOME OF THOSE NASCENT TECHNOLOGIES. AS THEY COME IN THAT DEEPER AND SIGN UP FOR BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- DOES HAVE A BIG IMPACT I THINK WHAT WE ARE ALSO FINDING IS IN THE WAY THAT THE CAPE A CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATES THE POSITIVE FISCAL BENEFIT OF THESE PROJECT. THERE ARE IS A CARRY OVER TO BOTH NOT ONLY THOSE THE LOCATION WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE LOCATED BUT WERE COMPANIES ARE ALSO BUYING SUPPLIES IN THEIR FEEDSTOCK FROM IN STATE. AND SO WE ARE ABLE TO SHOW HOW WE'RE SUPPORTING THOSE INDUSTRY CLUSTERS IN THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES WITH AN OVERALL -- PUBLIC BENEFIT WILL THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION. YOU KNOW I WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS. IS THERE A WAY A THE WE CONTRACT MORE CLOSELY [inaudible] N.. IN A PROCESS TO GET THE ANSWER THE QUESTION. OF WHAT THE GENERAL FUND FISCAL IMPACT IS. IS THERE A WAY TO DO THAT. THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION I WANT TO KNOW I LIKE TO HAVE I DON'T LIKE. FUZZINESS IN THE NUMBERS I JUST. THAT THAT KIND OF DISTURBS ME IN OTHER YOU KIND HER YOU KNOW NOBODY CAN TELL ME. SO IT'S KIND OF A FAIR QUESTION I MEAN YOU KNOW I'M I'M -- I'M BUDGETING FOR THE BUDGET AND DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO FUND EDUCATION I WANT TO FUND OTHER THINGS. AND YOU KNOW I WHEN A BILL COMES UP I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW. HOW MUCH IS IT COSTING THE GENERAL FUND HOW MUCH IS ACROSS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I MEAN? THAT'S A THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION SO WE KIND OF IS THERE A WAY OF CAN WE DO A BETTER JOB AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. STATE JUST REAL QUICK I'M SORRY IT'S SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE TO DO IS THAT -- GETTING TO WHERE SENATOR ABOUT WOULD LIKE TO BE AGO I LIKE TO BE TO ADDRESS THE COMMENT DIRECTLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND I COULD ADDRESS IT IN TWO WAYS IF THERE IS NOT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM AN EXACT NUMBER TODAY THANK US TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO IF THERE IS AN ABILITY HERE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO BE A TO GIVE THEM A GREATER -- MORE PRECISE NUMBER AND LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADD HERE THAT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BE FOLLOWING UP WITH REST THE COMMITTEE. SO START WITH HIS CREEL THE TREASURER'S OFFICE BETTER DRESS THAT A QUESTION DIRECTLY AND THEN IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO BE AN ADDRESS IT DIRECTLY HERE DID TODAY -- HERE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HAD TO GET THE INFORMATION TO COMMITTEE AND I'LL TURN OVER MISCREANT INTO THE LA. OKAY I HAVE TWO ANSWERS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE FUZZY WHAT I HEARD AND LA -- SAY IS THAT THERE'S NO IMPACT TO THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING STATEWIDE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED OR CD TFA SO THIS PROGRAM WHAT I HEARD LA -- SAY WAS THAT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL EMPIRE IN FACT I MAY HAVE MISSED HEARD. I GUESS MY BICYCLE CALL AND WHAT ON YOUR ON YOUR TABLE WHAT IS THIS THE STATE SALES TAX. NINE EIGHT SEVEN OR A SEVEN AND A QUARTER IS THE STATE RATE THAT AND BUILD LOCAL AVERAGE RATE IS IN THERE CAPE ESTIMATES I BELIEVE. 9%. OKAY LA OUT -- ASKED THANK YOU SAID CHRISTINE LA -- THAT SAID SENATOR BELL SIR ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE THAT THE ANSWER IS FUZZY IS SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION THAT WAS OF GREAT INTEREST TO US AS WELL. DISCUSSED IT WITH VARIOUS ENTITIES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IT SERVES TO HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY. THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED THAT THERE'S NOT -- DATA THAT COULD JUST SORT OF READILY IDENTIFY IT SORT OF A VERY FINE LEVEL OF PRECISION -- THEY COULD AT LEAST THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US THAT COULD. SEE SORT OF ENABLE SORT OF A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF EXACTLY WHAT PURCHASES WERE BEING USED -- IN EACH PROGRAM THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT TYPE OF ESTIMATES I THINK I'M NOT SURE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD MAKE MORE PRECISE N A QUICK TIMETABLE I THINK. FRANKLY IT MIGHT REQUIRE SOME CHANGES TO SERVE TAX ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES PERHAPS EVEN A CHANGES IN STATURE TO THAT EFFECT TO REALLY GET A VERY PRECISE ESTIMATE. WITH WITH S. SAID ABOUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE A TO DO IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET HIM OUR BEST ESTIMATE. IF IT'S NOT HERE TODAY. BY LATE THIS WEEK AT FIRST THING NEXT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT QUESTION AT THE CENTER IS ASKING AND WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET THAT -- THROUGH GOT IN FIVE STAFF YES PLEASE -- MY AND COOK WITH VARYING YOU'RE INCLINED PHARMACEUTICALS WE WERE AND AWARD. JUST TO CLARIFY SOME OF THIS I THINK THERE. YOUR UNDER THIS PRESUMPTION YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVERYTHING WE PURCHASED IS GOING TO BE LOCAL AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- WERE A BIO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN FREMONT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MANUFACTURING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT. GENERALLY PURCHASE THINGS EVEN WITHIN THE STATE WITH IN ANOTHER STATE OR GOES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. SO THE SALES TAX WAS ISN'T GOING TO TAKE PLACE HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED WITH MAKING WHAT WE NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER KERRIGAN ELECTED TO TURN IT BACK TO THE GOOD CENTER FRANCE HAS A MISCARRIAGE. STRUCTURE ALL ON THAT POINT. SHE IS SO THEY EVEN THOUGH THE IF IF THE IF THEY BALK OF THE PURCHASES ARE EITHER OUT OF STATE OR OUT OF THE COUNTRY THEN CLEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT HERE IS A LOCAL REVENUE LOSS THAT YOU THAT'S NOT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS BENEFITING. IT THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE BENEFIT TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING -- BUT THE SO SO THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED OUT ON MY CLEARLY IF THERE WERE SOME BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA JOBS OR SOMETHING -- YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A BROADER ARGUMENT TO MAKE BUT THAT'S ANOTHER LEVEL OF OUR CONCERN IS IF A LOT OF THIS EQUIPMENTS COMING FROM ELSEWHERE. AND WE ARE POTENTIALLY AGAIN I I KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD BE UP BUT IF THE AUTHORITY IS TO UP TO A BILLION THE END AND OUR CONTRIBUTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS. A HALF A BILLION IT'S JUST WORTH. MAKING SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE THE BENEFITS ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO CENTER BELL TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I DO SEE MISS CARILLO. WOULD LIKELY RESPOND BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO CENTER ABOUT FIRST OR TO GO. I GOT MY ANSWER THERE'S NO WAY OF FIGURING OUT AND WHAT WE DO JUST DOES A PRACTICE. IF WE DO BILLS LIKE THIS WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE. AND I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE. SOME WAY THE TAX CODE OR THE TAX REGULATIONS. TO CLARIFY FOR US WITHIN A REASONABLE ESTIMATE. WHAT EXACTLY THE IMPACT ON THE THE STATE GENERAL FUND IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT? THIS SPECIAL FUNDS. OF TRANSPORTATION PARTICULARLY IN MY CASE -- WHAT DOES IMPACTS ARE AND I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION THE US OF? GENERAL'S GENERALLY ALL THESE -- KINDS OF EXCLUSIONS CREDITS I MEAN IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I MEAN SO I TAKE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN. PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE COULD. ASSET QUESTION WHEN. UP WHEN LEGISLATION COMES BEFORE US. ACTUALLY NO THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY IT IS MORE THAN FAIR I TO BE ABLE TO ASK A QUESTION. I CENTER BELT THAT WORKS FOR YOU SIR WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH BOTH. OF THE SENATORS OFFICES WAS THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO TRY TO BE TO GET YOU AN ESTIMATE. IN AS WE GO -- FORWARD -- TEAM WILL BE ASKING -- THAT ESTIMATE POTENTIALLY OF THIS STATE GENERAL FUND AND I DO THINK IT IS FAIR WE'RE GONNA -- TURNED OVER TO MISS CARILLO TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUICKLY THEN WE'D LIKE TO IN TURN OVER CENTER GALGIANI FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS IN A POTENTIAL CLOSE RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE SOMETIME TO ADD SOME CLARIFICATION SO  JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES US TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A NET BENEFIT TO THE STATE. AND SO WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ASKING -- WHAT JOBS ARE BEING RETAINED WHAT NEW JOBS ARE BEING CREATED TO ASSESS THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS A NET BENEFIT TO THE STATE SO THE FISCAL BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM THE PROJECTED SALES TAXES OF THE WIDGETS? PERSONAL INCOME TAX CORPORATE TAXES ON THE PROFITS PROPERTY TAXES FROM IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER INDIRECT FISCAL BENEFITS WE'RE HAVING A BIG IMPACT ON MITIGATING FOSSIL FUELS WITHIN THOSE PROJECT LOCATIONS AND THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ARE QUANTIFIED. I'M AT THE DOLLAR VALUE OF THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. THAT WELL I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION OF OF THE LOS N IMPACT -- WE TOOK THAT VERY SERIOUSLY UPON PROGRAM DESIGN AND HAVE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO ASSESS THAT. CENTER GALGIANI WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL TIME TO RESPOND AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR -- AS WELL AS STATE TREASURES TEAM UP FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS THANK YOU TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL MISTER LA OKAY -- IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE EXACT LA L. BUT I SAID GREAT JOB AS ALWAYS WE APPRECIATE YOUR AT YOUR GUIDANCE. BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GALGIANI WILL BE FOLLOWING UP. WE'LL BE TAKING A VOTE -- AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR PORTANTINO WHO HAS TWO BILLS AND FROM THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A TWO MINUTE RECESS THERE'S A QUICK. ITEM THAT LIKE TO BE A TO DISCUSS ANOTHER BILL -- THAT WE HAVE A TIME CERTAIN WAS CENTER PORTANTINO -- IF YOU CAN GIVE US A TWO MINUTE RECESS WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU ONE INTERESTING. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ON IT SURE [inaudible] HEALTH AND 1000% HIGHER [inaudible] RIGHT THOSE [inaudible] YEAH. ALRIGHT WE'RE BACK. LADIES THE GERMAN I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE DELAY WERE WORKING OUT SOME HOUSEKEEPING. AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING CENTER JACKSON IS UNABLE TO BE WITH HIS HERE TODAY. HER WITNESSES TURN INTO PUMPKINS AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. IN WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO MOVE HER BILL. SHE WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO LEAD US OFF TODAY. SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO BE A TO DO AND I WANT TO SEND A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO A CENTER PORTANTINO WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE PRESENTATION OF SB. ONE EIGHT TWO SB. ONE EIGHT TWO AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO BETTER TURN IT OVER TO CENTER PORTANTINO WHO IS TO BILLS. IN FRONT OF COMMITTEE. SENATE TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO AS CENTER NIELSEN TO BE A CHAIR AND ON BEHALF OF SENATOR JACKSON WILL BE PRESENTING SENATE BILL. ONE EIGHT TWO THERE NIELSEN. WE WILL LEAD NEW SB. ONE EIGHTY TWO PRESENTED BY THE CHAIRMAN [inaudible] WORK. THANKS TO HELP COVER NOISE. WHEN? THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE QUICK MEMBERS AND ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE CHAIR. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN WHAT OUR STATE IS EXPERIENCE A LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASONS. IN OUR HISTORY A COMBINATION. TO DROUGHT FEELS ACCUMULATION CLIMATE CHANGE DO SEVERE WEATHER RESULT IN AWHILE FIRES OF ON PRESENT PRESIDENT DECIDES IN INTENSITY. BUT IT KILLED OVER ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DESTROYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BURNED WELL OVER A MILLION ACRES. THIS PERSISTENT THREAT OF WILDFIRE PROSE IS A SIGNIFICANT REST TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE MUCH IS BEING DONE TO BETTER MANAGER FORCE. THERE MUST BE MORE DONE TO BE ABLE TO HARDEN OUR EXISTING HOMES TO MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT. AND RESISTANT A WILDFIRE IN IMPROVE LAND USE DECISIONS AND MINIMIZE THIS THREAT. IN THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT. IT FOCUSES ON NEW COMMUNITIES INCREASINGLY BUILT IN WILD IN AREAS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ISMS. AT ARE MORE A AT THE MARCH THIRTEENTH HEARING THAT THE CENTER JACKSON HELD IT FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS -- AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS COMMITTEE ALONG WITH NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ACTION TO BOLSTER LOCAL PLANNING EFFORTS DESIGN MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. CONDITION DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS TO ENSURE THAT STRUCTURES AND COMMUNITIES ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM FIRE OR ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OUT OF HARM'S WAY. AND THIS BILL THIS BILL IS GROUND BREAKING IT DOES PRECISELY THAT. NUMBER ONE IT CONDITIONS NEW CONSTRUCTION AND IDENTIFIED WE AREAS UPON CITIES AND COUNTIES MEETING SPECIFIED WILDFIRE RISK EDUCTION STANDARDS. REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO VERIFY ON GOING COMPLIANCE WITH DEFENSE DISPENSE WILSON DEFENSIBLE SPACE. EDUCATION MANAGEMENT AND LOCAL FIRE PLAN WHILE FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANES INCLUDING INCLUDING DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE FOR EACH IMPACT PROPERTY AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS. A DIRECT COUNTIES IN TANDEM WITH UPDATING THEIR GENERAL PLAN SAFETY ELEMENTS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RECTOR FOR ITS STRATEGY. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION IN INCLUDES PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFIED IMPACTED INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS AND MILESTONES FOR COMPLETING RETROFIT WORK. IN ADDED TO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES IN FINANCING STRATEGIES. MANY AMENDMENTS AS YOU ALL KNOW REQUIRES ALL DEVELOPMENT IN WHAT WE ARE IS TO MEET. SPECIFIED FIRE RESPONSE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN IGNITION REDUCTION STANDARDS INSTEAD OF ONLY DEVELOPMENTS OF ELEVEN OR MORE STRUCTURES. THE LAST MAN IN PARTICULAR DIRECTING THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO UNDERTAKE A NOTICE AND COMMENT RULEMAKING TO ESTABLISH NEW WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS THAT ACCOUNT MORE MORE PRECISELY FOR CLIENT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE. WEATHER IN DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. SHOULD HELP REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN RISK REDUCTION SANDERS RAISES A CONCERN POTENTIALLY BY THE OPPOSITION THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY. CENTER JACKSON HAS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR WITNESSES WHO HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY COLLABORATIVE OVER THE PAST MANY MONTHS IN WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE TIME. MISTER CHAIR. IF WE HAVE WITNESSES IN FAVOR WHO WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT. THE MORNING TRACY WRI WROTE COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON VEGETATION FUEL MANAGEMENT -- THROUGH SB NINE A ONE SB -- ONE EIGHTY TWO THIS YEAR FOCUSES ON THE OTHER TWO PRONGS OF MITIGATING FIRE RISK -- TO LIFE AND PROPERTY AND THAT'S CREATING MORE FIRE SAFE COMMUNITIES AND ALSO FINDING A MECHANISM TO ENFORCE COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL HOME FIRE SAFETY -- TO CREATE MORE FIRE SAFETY FOR FIRE SAFE COMMUNITIES THIS BILL REQUIRES SPECIFIC WILD WILD FIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS FOR ALL DEVELOPMENTS -- AS THE SENATOR SAID THROUGH NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION STANDARDS AND ALSO THROUGH REGULATIONS BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL -- SB ONE A TWO ALSO REQUIRES -- SITE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT -- PLANNING -- SO TO CONSIDER HOW TO CREATE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT HAVING. THE WAY THAT THE LAY OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS CREATING SAFE AREAS -- FOR EVACUATION IN CREATING OPEN SPACE FOR FIRE BREAKS. SB WHEN A TO ALSO ALSO CREATES A STRUCTURE -- FOR COMMUNITY AND HOMEOWNER LAND MANAGEMENT -- BY REQUIRING -- THAT THERE'S ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO CHECK IT ENSURE THAT DEFENSE WILL SPACES MAINTAINED IT ALSO CREATES -- AN ASSESSMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY MUCH LIKE THROUGH AN H. AWAY OR OR SOME OTHER STRUCTURE -- TO FIND THIS DEFENSIBLE SPACE MAINTENANCE WHICH CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. BUT AS YOU WANTED TO PROVE ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPROVING ANY KIND OF DEVELOPMENT -- AND LESS THE PROJECT AND ALL THE STRUCTURES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE WILD FIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL REALLY CREATES A BALANCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- REALIZES IT RECOGNIZES THAT WE NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE AND LOOKING HOW -- THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE -- PLACED IN FIRE PRONE AREAS AND WE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT COMMITTEE STAFF HAS DONE AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN WORKING WITH US IN CREATING -- A SPACE FOR US THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BRING THIS PROGRAM UP -- BUT TO ALSO CREATE SOME. ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- I HAVE -- EITHER WAY LEAN RC RC GENERAL COUNSEL HERE FOR ANY KIND OF DETAILED TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. AS YOU PROCEED LET ME ENCOURAGE YOU. TO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEET A TEST OF COMFORT FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME THAT'S REPRESENTED NINETEEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES MANY OF WHICH A RURAL. THIS COULD BE LOOKED AT IS KIND OF DISCRIMINATORY TOWARDS -- DISCOURAGING. ANY EXPANSION OR LOCATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. A HIGHER STANDARD IF YOU WILL. AND IN IN A IN A PEDIMENT SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE CONVINCED AT LEAST ME SO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU DISCUSS. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANKS PAUL MASON WITH CIVIC FOREST TRUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING. I REALLY WANT TO SEND MY APPRECIATION TO BOTH SENATOR JACKSON BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY TO THE RURAL COUNTIES FOR COMING TO THE TABLE. AND PUTTING SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY INTO COMING UP WITH WHAT THEY SEE AS A WORKABLE WAY FORWARD TO DEAL WITH A DIFFICULT THORNY PROBLEM. I MEAN. NEARLY EVERYBODY AGREES THAT. WELCOME IN THIS CONDITION WHERE WE'RE SEEING MORE EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR -- YOU KNOW THAT PROBLEMS ONLY GET WORSE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO STOP MAKING OUR CHALLENGE OF DEFENDING HOMES THAT ARE OUT IN. HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WORSE THIS IS A REASONABLE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN SOMETHING WHERE THE COUNTIES HAVE COME TO THE TABLE AND SAID WE THINK THIS WORKS SO. I THINK THE WITH THE ENTITIES THE YOU SEE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT REALLY SPEAK FAR MORE THAN -- I CAN DESCRIBE IN TWO MINUTES IN TERMS OF THE MERITS OF THIS -- YOU KNOW FROM A FOR THE PERSPECTIVE OF NOT MAKING UP OUR CHALLENGES WORSE I THINK THAT -- IT IS A IN THE ENTIRELY. MODEST APPROACH WITH THOSE THAT COME FORWARD AND SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT -- PROHIBIT BUILDING ANYWHERE AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT A PRACTICAL WAY -- TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THE KEEPER FIREFIGHTERS OUT OF HARM'S WAY THAT'S JUST AND OURSELVES UP. FOR ADDITIONAL LOSSES AND WE NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL THERE -- I SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE PROVISION AT THE END OF THE BILL THE TALKS ABOUT -- PROPOSES FUNDING SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES EVACUATION ROUTES ETCETERA ALL VERY MERITORIOUS THINGS PROPOSED TO FUND THEM FROM THE FOREST HEALTH -- ALLOCATION IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WE THINK WE SHOULD FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO PAY FOR SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND NOT BE DIVERTING THE FOURTH HEALTH MONEY -- BUT WE'RE VERY SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR DRIES OUT. THANK YOU PLEASE PRAY THANK YOU KAREN MARTIN'S AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ROLE COUNTIES REALLY I'M MADE ALL OUR SALIENT POINTS ALL JUST NOTE THAT AFTER THE DEVASTATION OF THE FIRES OVER THE PAST. SEVERAL YEARS COUNTIES HAVE COME TO THE TABLE AND WE REALIZE WE HAVE TO DO MORE WE HAVE TO DO MORE IN A VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION. BALANCING BOTH THE NEED TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING COMMUNITIES IN RURAL AND URBANIZED AREAS BUT ALSO PUT INTO PLACE SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES AND PRESSURES. THAT THESE COMMUNITIES FACE WITH HOUSING NEEDS AND AND OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY FACE -- WE DO HAVE A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT -- POSITION ON THE BILL AND THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF TREMENDOUSLY FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE SUPPORTER AND MOVING THIS BEFORE TODAY THANK YOU THANKS. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS AREN'T ABLE ANSWER REPRESENT AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WE ALSO HAVE AN OFFICIALLY TAKEN A SUPPORT POSITION BUT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THERE WERE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND REALLY SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING. I'M INTENT OF THE BILL AND AS US THE SECOND TICKET AT THIS IS A TOUGH CONVERSATION BUT A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SAFEGUARDING OUR COMMUNITY IS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- AND REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR JACKSON AND EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN RC RC AND EVERYBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU. THE MINISTER MEMBERS CHASE RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT WE DON'T KNOW FROM POSITION YET -- HOWEVER -- BUT WE ARE VERY SUPPORT OF HIS CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE IT ON THEIR TWO THINGS WITH A VERY BRIEFLY MENTION THOUGH -- ONE PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME -- IN ORDER FOR US TO APPEAR PLANS RIGHT NOW IT SAYS UPON THE NEXT HOUSING ELEMENT -- AMENDMENT OR YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY SOBRE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE IN THESE AREAS MIGHT NEED A LITTLE EXTRA HELP PERHAPS SOME MONEY I'M SORE THANKFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MONEY IN HIS BUDGET FOR PLANNING WHICH CERTAINLY CAN ASSIST -- WITH THIS THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND FOLKS IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT EASY EITHER OFF LIMITS TO BUILDING THERE IS WHICH IS NOT THE INTENT IS BILL OR MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY TO BUILDINGS FIRE PRONE AREAS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT OUR CITIES PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE A LOWER OBLIGATION FOR PLANNING. FOR HOUSING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES IT CAN'T BE BOTH WE CAN HAVE A REALLY HIGH READ A NUMBER AND THEN ALSO THEN NOT BE ABLE TO GET THOSE UNITS CONSTRUCTING THE AREA. BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL PENALTIES NOW BEING ASSOCIATED WITH NON COMPLIANCE WITH ARENA SO WITH THAT WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND IT'S OUR HOPE TO WILL GET TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. THAT'S A BILL THAT DOUBLE HAD STORED AND NOW WE HAVE A THREAD OF TAKING AWAY THE GAS FUEL MONEY. THE COMMUNITIES A DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT THE STATE WOULD MANDATE AND THE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT DIRECTION PLEASE. WIENER SERRANO IF THERE'S ANYMORE ARE YOU SUPPORT BETWEEN OKAY. TWENTY I DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANKS. YES HELLO GONZALEZ WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY LIKE MANY OTHERS SINCE HE DOESN'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE DO APPRECIATE SENATOR JACKSON ENGAGING US WITH US VERY EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS. WE RECOGNIZE THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS THAT WILDFIRES HAVE HAD IN THE STATE AND WE THINK THAT WE FUNDAMENTALLY NEED TO RE EVALUATE LAND USE POLICIES THAT HAVE LED TO PEOPLE BEING PUT IN HARM'S WAY -- TO THAT EXTENT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH SB WHEN HE TO ALTHOUGH IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS WE ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT USING G. JR **** -- HEALTHY HOMES HEALTHY FORCED FUNDS EXCLUSIVELY -- FOR SORRY EXCLUSIVELY FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO FIND BOTH. OF FORCE RESTORATION AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION SPECIFICALLY PRIORITIZING PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH A WAY THAT IS -- HAS FOR STRATEGY MANAGEMENT -- IN MIND BUT ALSO WILL COVER LARGE AREAS OF LAND SO WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE SENATOR AND LOOK FOR TO THAT CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT THANK YOU. HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION WITH THE REGIONAL COUNCIL RURAL COUNTIES OF GOOD OPPOSITION RC RC AND THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS. THE PREVENTION OKAY THAT WAS THAT WAS YEARS. CAN OPPOSITION YEAH OKAY. JUST AS LONG AS THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION. AGAIN I RETAIN SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT. AND ALSO THE CONCOMITANT NEED TO HAVE SOME. PLANNING RESTRICTIONS ON MORE URBANIZED COMMUNITIES IT ENCROACH ON THE URBAN INTERFACE AREA. IT ISN'T JUST THE RURAL AREAS THAT HAVE CREATED PROBLEMS IT IS LARGER COMMUNITIES BUILDING OUT. IN EXPANDING INTO THE THRESHOLD. REACHABLE BY LARGER FIRES IT WE NOW INDOOR. AND WE CANNOT NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT ASPECT. AND THERE MAY BE A NEED I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME REQUIREMENTS ON LARGER COMMUNITIES RELATED THE INTER URBAN FACE. URBAN INTERFACE YET SOMETHING SIR. IF YOU CALL THE OPPOSITION YEAH A LITTLE EARLY. I'M AFRAID OF LIFE. MAYBE OF THE A GOOD MORNING THIS MISTER CHAIR. TEN MEMBERS -- THE CAMERA ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THIS BILL AS A HOUSING KILLER -- I PREFER. WE HAVE A WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THIS BILL IS A HOUSING KILLER AND YOU SAW SOME REFERENCES TO THAT CONCERN. I THINK WHEN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES CAME UP AND MENTION THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- I WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IF WE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. EARLIER ON PERHAPS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BUT HAVING SAID THAT OUR APPROACH TO AND AN ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL IS A TASK. TO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS WHERE DOES IT APPLY AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THOSE AREAS. SO YOU HER REFERENCE TO WHOOPIE THAT MEANS THAT IT'S VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SONS WERE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE THOSE ARE POSTED ON THE INTERNET WE CAN LOOK AT HOSE MAPS AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT ARE PROJECTS. ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS REGULATORY REGIME. IT ALSO APPLIES TO AREAS OUTSIDE OF THAT ONE OF THOSE AREAS. ANY AREA WERE STRUCTURE INTERMINGLED WITH VEGETATION. THINK ABOUT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. IS SACRAMENTO WE ARE KNOWN FOR AND DESIRABLE FOR THE THE LARGE NUMBER OF TREES WE HAVE IN DOWNTOWN MADE TOWN AND IN THE SUBURBS. THAT'S VEGETATION. THAT. ALONG WITH CAPITOL PARK WE HAVE MCKINLEY PARK LAND PARK THAT NOW BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR OUR PROJECTS AS WERE BUILDING HOUSING IN THESE AREAS THAT ARE DANCE. MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS -- THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THE STATE WANTS US TO BUILD THAT BECOMES AN OBSTACLE. THAT IS OVERBROAD AND MAKES THE BILL UNWORKABLE. I WANT TO IT UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THIS BILL ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE. PRECEDED. HAVE TAKEN THE APPROACH. THAT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S NO PERFECT PLACE IN CALIFORNIA TO BUILD. AND THIS BILL IT'S WILDFIRES IN OTHERS IT'S SEISMIC IN OTHERS IT'S DISPLACEMENT GENTRIFICATION AG LAND PRESERVATION HABITAT CONSERVATION WETLANDS TOXICS. YOU NAME IT EVERYBODY'S GOT AN ISSUE. SO IN LESS WE STOP FOCUSING SOLELY ON ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND GIVE SUFFICIENT BALANCE THE CREATION OF MORE HOUSING. FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED SHELTER WE'RE ONLY GOING TO PROLIFERATE THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT HAS LESS TO A DEFICIT OF THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THESE AREAS? I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAND USE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS I READ THE BILL MULTIPLE TIMES I CAN'T FIGURE OUT FROM THE BILL WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THOSE AREAS. THERE'S LOTS OF CROSS REFERENCES TO VARIOUS NON REGULATORY REGIMES THE EITHER AND DON'T EXIST AT ALL OR ONLY EXIST IN A FEW PLACES.% THAT MAKES THIS BILL SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T DETERMINE HOW TO PLAN DESIGN OR CONSTRUCT A PROJECT IN WHATEVER AREA IT APPLIES. TO THAT TURNS IT INTO SIMPLY A GAME OF GOTCHA. THAT'LL DISRUPT PROJECTS THAT ALREADY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF APPROVAL AND PLAN FOR HOUSING. YOU PROBABLY THINK IN. WHO IS THIS INSENSITIVE JERK THAT'S COMING UP HERE AND SAYING YOU KNOW DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WILDFIRES ARE IMPORTANT? I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY DAUGHTER WAS CAUGHT IN THE THOMAS FIRE. FOUR NIGHTS WE DIDN'T SLEEP WONDERING IF SHE ALIVE IS SHE NOT ALIVE SHE LOST THERE THE LOS CELL PHONE TOWERS THEY LOST POWER. AND SHE IS STATE WITH THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK IN AFTER BEING EVACUATED THREE TIMES EVENTUALLY CAME HOME. HOW CAN I ARGUE FOR HOUSING HAVING HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I ALSO WANT A PLACE FOR HER TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA? AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALWAYS. KEEP IN MIND WE NEED A PATHWAY FORWARD FOR HOUSING. WE NEED A PLACE FOR HOUSING. IF YOU SAY NO ONE ONE AREA YOU NEED TO REMOVE OBSTACLES IN ANOTHER. WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS IN THE DATA. OF THE DATA FROM THESE FIRES YOU'LL NOTE. THAT THE HOMES THAT WERE BURNED OR ONES THAT WEREN'T COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING THE RIGHT EXISTING REGULATORY REGIME. THAT IS THEY WERE EITHER NOT IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS OR WEREN'T BUILT AT A TIME WHEN THE LATEST CODES APPLIED. SO WE'VE DONE THAT ANALYSIS YOU CAN DO IT JUST BY LOOKING ON THE INTERNET THIS IS A BILL THAT FOCUSES ALMOST ENTIRELY. ON NEW DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S THE NATURE OF PLANNING AND LAND USE LAW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T GO BACK TO EXISTING RESIDENTS. FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE ENFORCEMENT HERE WHICH HAS BEEN A PROBLEM AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. HAVING SAID THAT AS IT STANDS WE FIND THE BILL TO BE UNWORKABLE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WELL YOU RAISE SOME LEGITIMATE POINTS. MAY I ASK PROPONENTS WHAT ABOUT A PARADISE COMMUNITY THAT NOW HAS TO REBUILD ALMOST FROM SCRATCH. WITH THIS LEGISLATION APPLY TO THEM AS A SIDE. TO REESTABLISH THEMSELVES. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I'LL TURN IT OVER HEIGHT TO THE RC RC TURNING ON THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE ITEMS. THAT YOU BROUGHT FORWARD -- IS WELL AS WELL AS WHITE -- THE REPRESENTATIVE AND APPRECIATE HIS COMMENTS FROM C. B. I A NUMBER ONE ON BEHALF OF CENTER JACKSON WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MINUTES IN -- EIGHT YOU HAVE HER COMMITMENT TO BE A TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL NUMBER. TWO WE TALK ABOUT READING THE BILL. THE STANDARDS ARE SPELLED OUT IN THE BILL. AND WHERE THE SUPPLIES. SO OVER READING THE BILL. THE STANDARDS ARE SPELLED OUT. THE NAME IS FOR SHARED WITH THE OPPOSITION YESTERDAY. THAT ALSO SPELLS OUT A PUBLIC PROCESS AND HOW THE STANDARDS WOULD BE ADOPTED. IS A VERY SPECIFIC PUBLIC PROCESS. THAT WOULD BE -- ADVANCED. THAT THE PUBLIC IN ALL INTERESTED PARTIES WOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK OF CRITICISMS. THIS IS NOT APPLY TO DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS NOT APPLY TO DOWNTOWN CHICO OR DOWNTOWN LAKE PORT IS SUPPLIES TO THE WILL BE. IN HIGH FIRE HAS A SEVERITY ZONES. IT'S IN THE BILL. DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO WOULD NEVER BE IN THIS BILL -- NOTHING IN THIS BILL FOCUSES ON THE ON THE DOWNTOWN CORE -- I WOULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL. IF IT WAS GOING TO BE AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON RURAL -- I'M ONE OF THE FEW DEMOCRATS IN THIS SENATE THE REPRESENTS A RULE DISTRICT AND UNFORTUNATELY LIKE CENTER NIELSEN HAVE SEEN. GOD AWFUL FIRES OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL IS REASONABLE AND PROVIDES A FIVE YEAR ON RAMP FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH NEW REGULATIONS MAY BE. A FIVE YEAR ON RAMP. THE SAME STANDARDS THAT WOULD IMPACT LA. MALIBU AND THE GOOD A BEACH. WOULD BE APPLIED TO CHICO CLEAR LAKE IN THE SHOP. WITHIN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS POTENTIAL DWELLINGS WITHIN THE WILLIE. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU LA COUNTY. HAS SOME OF THE LARGEST -- WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE ZONES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR ENDED HERE AND TURN IT OVER TO THE R. C. R. C. TURNING GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORK. THERE IS ALSO THREE TIERS ARE SPELLED OUT IN THIS BILL. VERY CLEARLY SAYING TO HOMEOWNERS THAT YOU CAN BUILD BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN TIER ONE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HARDER BUILDING STANDARDS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PUT DEFENSIBLE SPACE. IN TIER -- TWO IN YET NINE UNITS OR ABOVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE FIRE PROTECTION PLANS RESPONSE TIME PLANS -- AND WHAT TO DO IF WE DO HAVE A FIRE BREAK OUT HERE THREE ONE HUNDRED UNITS ARE ABOVE YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE OPR BEST STANDARDS BY THE WAY THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE. IN ALL THIS INDEED YOU'RE INJURED OVER MISTER CHAIR TO THE RCA RCR ATTORNEY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BUILDING WE BUILD HOMES IN THE WILL WE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT EVACUATING -- AND WHAT I KNOW ANDWHAT YOU KNOW IS THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT IS GOING TO STOP THE TYPE OF FIRE THE DISTASTE HIS UNFORTUNATELY SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND SO WE HAVE TO START PUTTING IN HAND STANDARDS ON PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. IN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HARDENING BECAUSE WE CAN PARDON HOME ALL WE WANT. BUT I'VE SEEN A FULL CEMENT HOME. COMPLETELY GUTTED. AND THE WALL STILL STAND. IT IS ALSO ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE. ADEQUATE. EVACUATION PLANS IN PLACE WHICH THIS BILL WILL ALSO DO INTO THE CHAIR IF IT'S OKAY ALL TURNED OVER THERE ARE SEARS YOU TURN. SOMEBODY'S PROCEED AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EVACUATION PLANS I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT I WAS HELPING THE COUNTY SHERIFF THE LONG TIME AGO. CHANGE OF AN EVACUATION PLAN ACTUALLY IS THE EVACUATIONS IN PLACE WELL. CERTAINLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NELSON AND LET ME ACTUALLY TRY TO ANSWER TO OF YOUR QUESTIONS AT ONCE IF I CAN. ONE IS THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON RULES AND WHETHER THAT'S AN UNFAIR IMPACT -- AND THE SECOND IS THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON THE REBUILDING OF PARADISE BECAUSE THOSE TOUCH ON ISSUES THAT -- WE CERTAINLY IS RURAL COUNTIES ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ON I WILL SAY THAT MYSELF S THE FORMER COUNTY COUNCIL FOR TO HIM A COUNTY -- IN YOUR DISTRICT AND ALSO VERY SENSITIVE TO A AND WE DEFINITELY DID NOT AS WE WERE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD THIS BILL ARE WE WERE VERY STE WE WERE ON VERY CAREFUL TO TRY TO AVOID THAT. SO ALSO COME IN TERMS OF PROJECTS IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED THAT ARE. PERMITTED IN PART. THAT AND PROCESS. THAT. TO AFFECT THEM -- SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS. YES WITH THE CAVEAT AND THE CABBIE OUT IS AS SOME TO REQUIRE VERY A VERY CLEARLY AND CORRECTLY NOTED THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MAJOR. ARM BUT I WILL SAVE MEDICAID ORDERS FOR THOSE OF US IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THOSE OF US -- TO THINKING ABOUT PARADISE AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE. THAT I THINK MAKES THIS BILL SOMETHING THAT IS VERY REASONABLE AND VERY WORKABLE. SO WITH REGARD TO RURAL COMMUNITIES WHICH FOR TO PARADISE IN PARTICULAR ONE OF THINGS WE WERE SENSITIVE TO OUR HOW DEVELOPMENTS ACTUALLY HAPPENED YOU KNOW INTO HIM A COUNTIES I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND WHAT THE REBUILDING PROCESS IN PARADISE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE GENERALLY SPEAKING MOST DEVELOPMENTS AGAIN YOU'REUNDER CORPORATE AREA TO HIM A COUNTY WHICH I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND IN THE REBUILD OF PARADISE OUT THERE NOT CAN BE A HUNDRED PLUS UNIT RANGE THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOUSE BY HOUSE. STREET BY STREET WE WERE COGNIZANT OF THAT WHEN THE TWIN THE TEARING WAS BUILT THE YOUR TIER ONE ASCENDER MCGUIRE INDICATED. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE FOR THE MOST PART VERY CLEARLY CAN VERY -- CLEARLY EITHER WITH AN EXISTING STANDARDS OR ARE A VERY MODEST EXPANSION OF EXISTING STANDARDS OR SOMETHING THAT -- SORRY I'LL TRY TO ROCK TO MAKE YOUR LITTLE THAT. OUGHT IN THE HALLWAY OF SO WE'LL HAVE TO TALK OVERTURE OKAY NOW NOW DO TRIED TO DO MY BEST. SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE ON THERE YOU CHIEF BORN ALTERNATELY COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE FREQUENTLY DO SEE ENROLLING CORPORATE AREAS THE END FOR THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE AS PART OF THE PARADISE REBUILD WE WERE VERY VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE ALL THIS THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS ALREADY RECEIVED IF IT HAS A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT HAS ALREADY GOTTEN ITS DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT IF AS A SUB DIVISION IS ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE SUBDIVISION PROCESS. AND ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO WERE BUILD HOMES IT'S GOING TO GETS GOING TO HAVE THOSE TIER ONE STANDARDS AS THE HOMES GO FORWARD IT'S ONLY BE GET NEW DEVELOPMENTS THINGS THAT HAVE NOT GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'VE GOTTEN THEIR DISCRETIONARY APPROVALS. YEAH THAT ARE YOU KNOW OR THAT ARE INVOLVING MULTIPLE UNITS A LARGE NUMBER OF UNITS AT ONE TIME THERE ARE POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT THE HIGHER STANDARDS. THE OTHER POINT TO KEEP IN MIND IS A SOME OF THEM REQUIRE REFERENCED ON THE ON RAMPS AGAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE A PROJECTS THAT ARE IN PROCESS AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT GETTING COMPLETED BEFORE THE YOU KNOW AS THE THE ON RAMP RAMPS UP. ON THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY GATORS THERE FOR THEM AS WELL SO WE WE TRIED TO BUILD IT AGAIN WITH A BALANCE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND INDEED THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. I'LL BUT WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED WE TRIED TO BUILD IN A WAY TO MAKE IT BOTH EFFECTIVE BUT REASONABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF FOR THE FOR THE COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION SIR. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION. HEARING NONE. TENDER BELLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MY DISTRICT DISTRICT -- SENATE-DISTRICT FIFTEEN WE HAVE LARGE AREAS UP IN -- HILLS UP ABOVE -- THE URBANIZED AREAS SANTA CLARA COUNTY THEY HAVE LARGE IN THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. AND WE ALSO -- ON THE CAL FIRE MAPS THERE. HI FIRE AREAS OF OF LOS GATOS SIR TOLD -- CUPERTINO -- AND THEN IN THE EAST WITH THOSE AS WELL -- POPULATIONS IN THE HUNT IN THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- THESE HIGH FIRE AREAS -- HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS YOU KNOW THERE LONG. OLD DEVELOPMENTS THAT OCCURRED AND A LOT OF THE IBM'S WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE THE GENERAL PLAN OF THE TONY. AND THE GENERAL FAN OF LOS GATOS AND THE OTHER CITIES IS. BECAUSE THEY WERE DEVELOP SO LONG AGO THERE'S A LOT OF CIRCULATION. US ST CIRCULATION PROBLEMS. OF DEAD END STREETS WITH LARGE HOW NUMBERS OF HOMES ON ON YOU KNOW YOU GO DOWN -- THE STREET AND BE A LOT OF HOMES AT THE END BUT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIRE AREA. SO -- THE PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN OF THE TWO CARS IN THE JOURNAL PLAN. IS -- A REDUCE. IS A RISK REDUCTION. STE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT OF A JOURNAL PLANNED SO. SO -- I THINK THE THE ONE OF THE AREAS OF PROBABLY NEEDS A LITTLE WORK OR ARTICULATION THIS BILL. IS THE BECAUSE I'M SHERMAN OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I LOOKED AT THIS. IS THE TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION. PROBLEMS IN HEART AND FIRE. HI FIRE AREAS. OF THE DEAD END STREETS ISSUES ONE YOU SHOULD UP TWO POINTS OF ACCESS -- ANOTHER -- ONE BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN OUR AREA IS IT ACTUALLY IS IS A PROBLEM IN GETTING AMONG THE REDWOOD TREES AND ALL THE BIG TREES OF PEOPLE LOVE TO LIVE UP THERE. AMONG THOSE TREES BUT WHAT THE TREES DO IS THEY BECAUSE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING FIRE EQUIPMENT UP THERE SO OUR OUR FIRE TEAMS HAVE TO HAVE. SMALL FIRE ENGINES THAT CAN MANEUVER THROUGH THE SMALL STREETS. AND THE MUTUAL AID. FIRE TRUCKS A LOT OF ROOM CAN'T GET UP INTO THOSE AREAS. SO -- JUST THE CIRCULATION -- EVALUATIONS AND HARM REDUCTION. LOOK AT THE CIRCULATION AND HOW YOU CAN REDUCE. HARM AND REAL US WITH. A BETTER. CIRCULATION IN THE IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HI HI. RHYS FIRE AREAS SO -- I THINK MAYBE THAT THAT COULD BE -- IN ADDITION TO THE BILL IT'S NOT COMING TO MY COMMITTEE -- I LOOK AT THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT WE HAD A PUBLIC MEETING. IN MY AREA IN LOS GATOS WERE. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT THE MEETING WAS LED BY CAL FIRE AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE CHIEFS. THEY ALL CAME DOWN TO THE MEETING AND WE THIS WAS THE TYPES ISSUES WE DISCUSS WE ALSO DISCUSS -- COPE COMPLIANCE. AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STRUCTURES IN THE HIGH FIRE AREA THAT DON'T CONFORM. AND LOOKING AT CO COMPLIANCE IN A MORE SEVERE WAY POSSIBLY. SO WE CAN -- GO UP DO INSPECTIONS SO. FIND -- HOUSING. THE FIRE MARSHALS WERE STRONGLY RECOMMENDING THIS CALL COMPLIANCE IS A NOTHER HARM HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY THAT WE NEED TO TO DO. I THINK THE BILL COULD ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE POSSIBLY. A LITTLE BETTER CLEARER SO SO THOSE ARE MY SUGGESTIONS AS A BILL GOES THROUGH -- I STRONGLY SUPPORT -- THIS -- LAND USE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING STRATEGY AND I HOPE THAT -- WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN WORKING OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES OUT. OF THAT I BRING UP OF THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL. COMMITTEES IN PROCESS AS WE GET SO I WANT I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE THE WORMS AND TO THE TO THE CHASE THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CHAIR SO -- IN THIS BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE CENTER BELLS FOCUS ON THIS AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN A FOCUS FOR SENATOR JACKSON'S WELL OF OF UPDATING THE GENERAL PLAN OF ACCESS POINTS IN AN OUT. SERVICE FOR WILD FIRE EQUIPMENT. CENTER NIELSEN WILL ALSO BE BRINGING FOR THE BILL SENATE BILL -- NINETY NINE AND THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON GETTING FOLKS IN GETTING FOLKS OUT -- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY COMPLIMENTARY OF THE WORK THAT CENTER JACKSON -- IN THIS TEAM HAS BEEN DOING -- AND IT IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY AND YOU YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD I HAVE THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IS NOT JUST ABOUT BUILDING HOUSING BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT GETTING FOLKS. OUT WHEN THERE IS A JAZZ FREE ON THEIR DOORSTEP AND THIS BILL WILL BE A FOCUS IN ON THAT AND THEN THERE WILL BE A SECONDARY BILL THAT THE SOON YOU'LL SINCE BEEN WORKING ON FROM HIS. THAT AWFUL EXPERIENCE IN IN PARADISE IS LOOKING AT HAVING OUR FIRE TEAMS GO UP INTO LAW. HOUSE BY HOUSE [inaudible] JUST THE YES I USED TO BE INSPECTION I CALLED I CALLED SOFT INSPECTIONS YEAH SERVER LIKE A COMMUNITY RELATIONS TYPE INSPECTION WHEN YOU GO AND TALK TO THE HOMEOWNER OR THE DOCUMENT AND MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT. WHAT THEY CAN DO THAT MAKE THEIR HOME FIRE SAFE SO THE FIRE -- TEAMS ARE GOING TO GO UP AND DO THAT BUT THEN FOLLOWING UP ON THAT AFTER. WORKING WITH THE HOMEOWNER A MORE DELIBERATE INSPECTION THAT'S MORE FORMAL. THAT WOULD -- TELL HIM HEY YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. WITH THE MORE SERIOUS ISSUES THANK YOU OF CODE ENFORCEMENT -- SO I THINK I THINK SOME -- HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES LIKE CODE ENFORCEMENT -- VERY IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW TO LAW WE HAVE LAWS ON THAT THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW WE SHOULD HAVE ILLEGAL. OR VIOLATIONS WE CAN REDUCE THOSE VIOLATIONS -- QUITE A BIT. IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THERE COULD BE A STRONG FOCUS. OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO MAYBE SUPPLEMENTS THOSE. FIRE TEAMS THAT WANT TO DO THIS TIME A CODE ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW WE COULD LOOK AT HOW WE HELP. INCREASE THE NUMBER OUT OF LITTLE WHAT I CALL. SOFT THE MORE THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS TYPE OF CODE ENFORCEMENT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO OUT. TO SIR TALK TO THE HOMEOWNER AND TRY TO HELP THEM WITH -- WITH THAT WITH THAT KIND OF INFORMATION I THINK THESE ARE THE SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME OUT OF OUR OUR WE HAD LIKE OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ATTEND THE SERVICE PROBABLY. YOU KNOW I WAS TOLD THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE. WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING THAT PROBABLY WILL HAVE THREE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. I MEAN I MADE WERE IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS A VERY. CRITICAL ISSUE FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION. AND WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO OUR BEST -- IN -- HELPING -- THESE THESE PEOPLE LIVING UP IN THOSE HILLS WERE. THERE IN THE RED ZONE SERVICE MAPS IS. ABSOLUTE OFFICER OUT THERE THEY SEE THE NOW I SHOWED EVERYBODY THE MAP RIGHT I SAID THIS. THIS FIRE ZONE GOES ALMOST INTO THE CENTER OF THE TOWN OF LOS GATOS FOR EXAMPLE. SO OF THINGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED UP IN SONOMA COULD HAPPEN IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY -- IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WE HAD A CERTAIN TYPE OF INCIDENT OCCURS SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU OF THE SENATE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. WHAT'S YOUR ALL WELL TAKEN THIS IS A ISSUE WITH MANY FACETS. AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS BILL IS IN PROCESS AND THAT I'M COMFORTABLE -- BUT THERE ARE RESERVATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. ACCESS ROADS THAT IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. BUT PAYING. FOR UPGRADING THOSE ROADS OR IN FACT PUTTING THE MEN. IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE AND WHAT WILL BE IMPACT ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DO THAT A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES DO NOT HAVE A SUSTAINING ECONOMIC BASE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE AND COMMITTEES LIKE. PARADISE DON'T ALMOST HAVE ANY RIGHT NOW SO. IT IS IN PROCESS AND IT'S A NOBLE ATTEMPT AND IT IT DOES FIT INTO THE OVERALL PICTURE OF SEVERAL OF US WORKING TOGETHER. OF FOR SOLUTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. OF DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING -- PRESENTATION OF SOCK PRESENTING A BILL IN THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE -- SO -- BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS HERE TODAY -- I PPRECIATE RESULTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- FOR PRESENTING FOR US CENTER JACKSON AND I APPRECIATE THE CENTER JACKSON IS -- REALLY -- HELPING TO INITIATE THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH HOW HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NEW. THE NEW ABNORMAL OR WHATEVER GOVERNOR BROWN REFERRED TO IT AS AN THE EXTREME DANGERS IN THESE ARE WILD FIRES OWNS -- AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OF NEW DEVELOPMENT A NEW HOUSING IN THESE AREAS SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. HOWEVER WE HAVE TO HANDLE THIS ISSUE VERY CAREFULLY AND AND AND AND THE THE THE CHALLENGES -- WE MAY SAY WE WANT LOS DEVELOPMENT AND WILD FIRES OWNS -- BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED HOUSING IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING. DOESN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO WERE LIVING IN CARS IT DOESN'T CHANGE ON THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO ARE BEING PUSHED OUT OF OUR STATE BECAUSE WE HAVE ABYSMALLY FAILED -- TO PRODUCE AN OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE POTENTIALLY RESTRICTING. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN ONE AREA THAT WE'RE NOT SUCH LOPPING OFF ABOUT HOUSING -- AND THERE IS LANGUAGE IT WAS AMENDED INTO THIS -- BUILD THAT COULD BE READ AS POTENTIALLY REDUCING RENO OBLIGATIONS OF CITIES IF THEY HAVE PARTS OF THE CITY THAT ARE WILD FIRES OWNS -- AND SO THIS BILL IS NOW COMING TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MAX WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ONLINE -- ONE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR -- DIED NOTHING IN THIS BILL -- WILL REDUCE ANY CITIES RINA OBLIGATIONS AND THAT IF YOU ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT BUILDING IN THIS PART OF OUR CITY -- BECAUSE IT IS A WILD FIRE RISK. THAT MEANS THAT THAT THAT HOUSING NEEDS TO BE BUILT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND NOT COULD MEAN. INCREASED DENSITY FOR EXAMPLE AND THE URBANIZED NON WILD FIRES OWN AREAS -- SO I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY IF THIS WERE IF THIS WERE IT THE FINAL FROM THE BILL I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- I WILL VOTE FOR IT TODAY TO MOVE FORWARD UNDERSTANDING WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW WITH LET'S SAY THAT WE NOW HAVE ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SECTOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM THEN WE CAN TAKE AN ACTION ON THE BILL [inaudible] ONE LAW. THEY'LL THEY'LL PRESENT -- ALTHOUGH THEY'LL SEND THEIR PRESENCE WIENER PRESENT. WE HAVE LOST AT LEAST A QUORUM.

SHE LOOKS FOR TO THAT AND DOES APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE SHE'S ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST FIRES INTERSTATES HISTORY THAT'S THE THOMAS FIRE. IS GOOD EFFORT COMES OUT OF THOSE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE SHE SAID SHE IS PHÃ­ WITNESS HERSELF. IN A AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS BILL STRATEGICALLY CRAFTED. ON THE MOST SEVERE WILDFIRE THREAT ZONES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IN DOES NOT PREVENT THE BUILDING OF NEW HOUSING THAT FOCUSES ON NEW STANDARDS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU DO WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS A DO PASSED A HOUSING COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER BALANCE IN ABOUT JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE YOU AGAIN SIR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. HEY ABSOLUTELY WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THIS HAS A DO PASSED AT THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MOTION BY SEN ABOUT MISS LANCASTER. ROLL CALL PLEASE QUIET BY WHY I'M MORE LONG THEY'LL. THEY'LL AYE HERTZBERG RICARDO NIELSEN [inaudible] WIENER. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A TWO ZERO IN ON A HOUSEKEEPING NOTE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKING IN HOUSING FOR TO KEEP THE ROLE OPEN. KEEP THE ROLE OPEN ON ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN THIS IS SB FIVE THIRTY TWO MISTER PORTANTINO. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO COME UP AND JOIN ME. I THINK I HAVE THE ENTIRE CITY OF GLENDALE HERE [inaudible] WELCOME GLENDALE. WITH THE MAYOR IS HERE. AND I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB FIVE THREE TWO AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE -- THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CITY OF GLENDALE AND IT'S APROPOS THAT WE JUST HAD A DISCUSSION ON REDEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THAT IS GERMANE -- TO SB FIVE THIRTY TWO AS WELL THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE GLENDALE TO USE THE REMAINING BOND PROCEEDS FROM THEIR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SUBORDINATE TAXABLE TAX ALLOCATION BOND. FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING -- AND IMPROVING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'M TOLD THAT IF THIS BILL PASSES WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THREE HUNDRED ACTUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. COMING TO THE CITY OF GLENDALE THAT'S EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEORY IT WOULD BE PRACTICE IF WE CAN -- PASS THIS BILL. THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BUDGET ACT APPROVAL WAS GRANTED DISSOLVING THE STATE'S FOUR HUNDRED PLUS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES -- AND FOR THE RECORD I OPPOSE THAT THESE AGENCY SERVES AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REDEVELOPMENT PROVIDED THE LARGEST ONGOING SOURCE. OF REVENUE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AS LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES PROVIDED ROUGHLY ONE BILLION ANNUALLY. FOR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE CLOSURE OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE REMOVAL OF FINANCING FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NEW FOR ALL HOUSING UNITS AS WELL AS FINANCING STRUCTURES AND INCENTIVES. FOR DEVELOPMENT STATEWIDE AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE INCREASING DEMAND WILD DWINDLING INCOMES IN REVENUE SOURCES HAVE COMPOUNDED THE PROBLEM. GLENDALE HAS A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SUBORDINATE TAXABLE ALLOCATION BOND AND IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS NON HOUSING DOLLARS FROM THE CENTRAL GLENDALE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA THAT IT IS PREVENTED. TO UTILIZE BY THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE DISSOLUTION REDEVELOPMENT ACT. RATHER THAN DE FEES OR CANCEL THIS BOND GLENDALE REQUESTS RESPECTIVELY TO DELEGATE IT TOWARDS A 100%. FOR DOUBLE HOUSING PURPOSES SO HERE'S A CITY THAT WANTS TO TAKE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN LIMBO AND USE IT FOR A 100% OF IT. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PURPOSES I BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THIS TO EVEN CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITY. FIVE NEVER GET ONE TIME SOLE SOURCE OF FUNDS WHICH WOULD BE LOCALLY CONTROLLED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THESE REDEVELOPMENT BONDS ARE SETTING SITTING ON UTILIZED. AND GLENDALE HAS MORE TO GAIN BY COMMITTING THIS MONEY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING RATHER THAN LETTING THE BONDS. BE CANCELED WITH ME TODAY I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE PROUD MAYOR OF GLENDALE ARE IN THE JAR IN AND A NUMBER OF CITY STAFF AND SO IF I GET HAVE THEM SPEAK THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. ABSOLUTELY WE TYPICALLY HAVE THE I TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORTED TWO MINUTES EACH MISTER MAYOR OBVIOUSLY WILL GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL TIME WE WELCOME YOU IN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORKING YOU'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE. CENTER PORTANTINO REPRESENTS. YES WE ARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'VE SERVED THREE TERMS AS THE CITY'S HOUSING AUTHORITY. SO I KNOW OF WHICH I SPEAK AT LEAST FOR THE CITY OF GLENDALE. A GLENDALE TAKES ITS COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SERIOUSLY WE BELIEVE IT IS OUR OBLIGATION OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR DUTY TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHENEVER WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. AND IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE HAVE CREATED A CLOSE TO SEVEN HUNDRED AFFORDABLE UNITS. FOR SENIORS FOR FAMILIES FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR VETERANS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GEARED UP TO DO WITH OUR HOUSING AUTHORITY WITH OUR DEDICATED STAFF. WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS WITHIN THE CITY WHERE? A FORMAL HOUSING MAKES THE BEST SENSE THESE ARE PROJECTS THESE ARE PIECES OF LAND THAT ARE NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEAR SCHOOLS. AND YOUR SHOPPING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF AS A CITY THAT WE HAVE A COMMITMENT. TO THIS. THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT -- THE COMMITTEE THE SENATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT PERMIT US TO USE THAT. AND WITH THAT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT AS THE AS OUR GREAT STATE SENATOR INDICATED. TO ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES WHOM WE HAVE WORKED WITH THROUGH THE YEARS WHO ARE -- RESPONSIBLE SERIOUS AND DEDICATED TO PROVIDING SAFE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO OUR RESIDENTS. IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON A DAILY BASIS CREATING -- NEW COMMUNITY PLANS WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ENCOURAGED AND IT IS INCORPORATED IN OUR HOUSING STRATEGY. THAT WE HAVE -- ON THE BOOKS-RIGHT NOW. IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- THAT WE WOULDN'T USE THAT MONEY ANY OTHER WAY IF SOMEONE WERE TO SAY HERE'S TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GLENDALE. DO WITH IT AS YOU WISH I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OUR COUNCIL OUR STAFF ARE CITY MANAGER. TAKE THIS COMMITMENT SERIOUSLY AND WE WOULDN'T USE IT FOR ANY OTHER WAY PARKS SCHOOLS LIBRARIES IT WOULD GO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S A CRISIS. THAT GLENDALE HAS NOT ESCAPED -- AND WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SERVE OUR RESIDENTS AND THOSE LESS-FORTUNATE WHO NEED THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMERICAN WE'RE GRATEFUL HE TRAVELED AT THIS FAR TO BE TO BE WITH US TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ELOQUENT TESTIMONY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK SIR.

OF THE BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE PROCESS THAT REALLY BEGAN OVER. THIRTY YEARS AGO AND REALLY TOOK FEET IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN FORD WAS CLOSE THIS IS THE LARGEST UNITED STATES ARMY CLOSURE IN HISTORY. AND IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK IS THE PROPERTY LARGER THAN THE COUNTY TO OF SAN FRANCISCO. SB ONE EIGHT NINE SETS UP A MEANS FOR THE REGION OF MODERATE TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE A CENTRAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD COMPLETE THE BASE FOR USE PLAN MISSION. IT ENABLES A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO ARE TAKING OVER. INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF WHAT WE DO. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS SOME WILL THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE LARGE LONGER OR SHORTER. BUT HOWEVER THIS BILL ITSELF WILL MAKE SURE THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL COAST WILL STILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM ITS ORIGINAL ADOPTION THE BASE REUSE PLAN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. AGAIN I WANT TO ACT EXTEND MY COMMENTS IN APPRECIATION FOR SENATOR MINING'S INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THE FOLKS IN THE JURISDICTIONS OF THE MONTEREY BAY WILL NEED THIS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK SO I AM HERE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR RESPONSES.

AND THE CITY'S -- FORT ORD RE USE OF THE ALREADY BOARD MEMBER DORY OAKS IS -- SMALL RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN THE SUN BELT OF MONTEREY PENINSULA. OF THE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES OF THE FORMER FORD OR DEL REY OAKS ALLOCATION IS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED FORTY ACRES EFFECTIVELY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF OUR SMALL CITY. WORK FORCE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE MAJOR ISSUES FOR DORY OAKS AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S EMPHASIS ON SOLVING THIS CRISIS STATEWIDE. DEL RIO TEXAS. IN THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS IS ACTIVELY UPDATING HOUSING ELEMENT OF ITS GENERAL PLAN. THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FORD OR PROPERTY WILL ALLOW US THE SMALL COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE'S EFFORT TO SOLVING HOUSING CRISIS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. TO REALIZE THIS GOAL IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT WE RETAIN A REGIONAL HABITAT PROTECTION ENSURE A STABLE WATER SUPPLY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLECT COMMUNITY FACILITIES DISTRICT FEES TO FUND THOSE REGIONAL NEEDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE DOOR ELKS AND MONTEREY WAITED UNTIL THE JURISDICTIONS WERE MORE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY FORWARDS CLOSURE. AND WE'RE ALLOWED TO REDEVELOPMENT REDEVELOP FIRST TO STABILIZE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THEIR THEIR RESIDENTS. BY ALL MANNERS THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE HEALTHIER NOW AND HRIVING DUE TO OPPORTUNITIES IN ASSISTANCE OF THE FOR A DEL RIO TO MONTEREY HAVE A MORE FOCUSED COOL ADDRESSING THOSE. HOW ARE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES BUT STRONGLY FEEL THE EXTENSION OF THE COMMUNITY FACILITIES DISTRICT IS ONLY EQUITABLE TO ALLOWING US THE REGIONAL ASSISTANCE AFFORD TO MARINE AND SEASIDE? DORIAL TO SUPPORT OF OF THE DIRECTION OF THIS BE ONE EIGHTY NINE TO LOOK FORWARD O WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF. AS THE BILL MOVES FOR THE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU KANSEN WE ONE TECHNOLOGY SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE ALONG WITH CENTER MONEY WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE CENTER MONEY. YOU'VE BEEN A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR WORK AND HAPPIER IN COMMITTEE. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO GET OPENING UP TO ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE. ADVANCE TO THE MICROPHONE THIS TIME. LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. NOT GONNA BE TURNED OVER TO THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE PLEASE ADVANCE. HEARING TINO OPPOSITION WE KNOW THAT TO BE HERE AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR MOTION TO APPROVE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR CLOSING OPINION. ONE OF SURPLUS WE WELCOME YOU TO THE TABLE HERE OR DRAMA. OUR SYSTEM HEY DOING SIR. HE DOES INTRODUCE YOURSELF PLEASE FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION THANK YOU FOR SOURCE I'M CITY MANAGER OF REMEMBER MY NAME'S LANE LONG I'VE BEEN A MARINA SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I APOLOGIZE TO MAYOR WAS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE HE'S AT THE A CULTURE COMMISSION HEARING TODAY AND SO I'M HERE REPRESENTING HIM AND OUR CITY COUNCIL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SOME MAJOR BOMB. AT OF ALL THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE -- IN THE FORMER FORT ORD PROPERTY HANG IN THERE ELKS IS HERE IN MONTEREY IN SEASIDE AND AND SALINAS AND ALL THE **** AND ENTITIES. READ IS THE ONLY ONE THAT IS SUPPOSED IN THIS BILL AND SO THE ASK YOU WHY ARE WE OPPOSE IN THIS BILL. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFFECTED AND IMPACTED AND BIRD AND A FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY -- IN THE REGION AND THE CONTINUATION OF FOR CONTINUES TO SEVERELY CAN'T HAMPER IN BURDEN OUR CITY -- WHEN FOR WAS FIRST CONTINUED IN? TWENTY FOURTEEN HI. THE DEAL WAS IS CONSENSUS TWENTY TWENTY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT FOR STARTED MEETING IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FORM TO TRANSITION TASK FORCE MET. SIX SEVEN TIMES. AND THEN ON NOVEMBER FOURTH TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY MADE A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD AND THE PRESENTATION WAS -- THEY WANT TO INITIATE A LEGISLATIVE MA'AM PROCESS THAT WOULD EXTEND. FOR THREE TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN THE GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND FLORA. AND THAT CONTINUES THE THE PROBLEM AND THE BURDENS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND AND WHILE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW IS ONLY A TWO YEAR EXTENSION WE ARE COMFORTABLE THAT THEY ARE NOT GONNA BE BACK AGAIN ONE TWO EXTENDED AGAIN. AND THEN EVEN THE TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH THAT IT WE SEVERELY -- RIGHT. IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US TO OPPOSE SOMETHING CEREMONY IS INTRODUCING HE HAS BEEN A HUGE ADVOCATE FOR REACHING HE'S BEEN A HUGE SUPPORT. FOR MARINA BUT WE HAVE SOME REALLY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL. AND THE REASON THAT WE OPPOSE IT NUMBER ONE PRIMARILY IS WE HAVE AN ALTERNATE TRANSITION PLAN -- THAT INSURERS. THE THE GAP FUNDING. THE REGIONAL PROJECTS. ALL THE OBLIGATIONS THE INTIMATE AGREEMENTS THOSE CAN ALL BE MAD AT TRANSITION PLAN WE'VE SUBMITTED TO LAUGH COAL WE HAVE SUBMIT TO REGIONAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHO HAS BEEN HIRED BY. FOR TO HELP WITH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS AND THEY HAVE ALL SAID THIS TRANSITION PLAN -- MEETS THESE NEEDS IT WORKS AND FOR CONSENT SAID IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE CAN MEET ALL THESE OBLIGATIONS AND ALWAYS FUNNY REQUIREMENTS SO WE DO HAVE A TRANSITION PLAN THAT WILL WORK THAT WILL OUT TO SUNSET. THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THE EXTENSION OF FOUR GETS BACK -- TO SOME OF THE STATE LEGISLATIVE. ACTS THAT IT CONFLICTS WITHIN IT ALTERS ONE IS THE REDEVELOPMENT LOCK. FOR EXAMPLE 35% OF ALL PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT CURRENTLY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. CONTINUES TO FLOW TO FOR A DESPITE THE DISSOLUTION OF THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SB ONE EIGHTY NINE CONTINUES THE PREFERENTIAL TAX INCOME MEANT THREE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZES THE FOUR BOARD TO ENCUMBER TAX INCREMENT FOR DECADES INTO THE FUTURE. WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE. REDEVELOPMENT SUCCESSOR AGENCIES ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES UP OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR HAS NO LIMIT FOR HAS NO OVERSIGHT. THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR ALLOCATES ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT TAX INCOME AND FOR THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES THE EXTENSION OF FOUR CONTINUES. THE DIVERSION OF TAXING IN COMMAND THE GIRLS HE OTHER TEXAN ENTITIES TO SCHOOLS TO RURAL FIRE DISTRICTS -- IF WE EXTEND THIS BE ON TWENTY TWENTY IT WILL CONTINUE TO TO DIVERT THAT TAX INCREMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- SB ONE EIGHTY NINE REALLY CONFLICTS WITH THE MALE WRIST LÃ  AND I REDEVELOPMENT ATTORNEY DOES THAT AND SO. I CAN GIVE YOU A LOT OF DETAILS ON THAT. BUT THE THIRD REASON HAD IT REALLY IS A PRIMARY REASON THAT WERE OPPOSING THIS IF TO MINISTER. IS IT CONTINUES TO CRIPPLE OUR COMMUNITY IN TWO PRIMARY AREAS BLIGHT. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE FORT ORD CLOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND A MARINA THE BULK OF THE BLIGHT STILL EXIST WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED pMILITARY. BARRACKS IN OUR CITIES THE SURROUND HER HIGH SCHOOL OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I'M SEE ISSUE AND BE EACH OF THESE BLIGHTED STRUCTURES ARE FULL OF HAZARDOUS LEADING ASBESTOS THE ENTRANCE FOR HIGH SCHOOL GOALS FOR THIS BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS WALK THROUGHS BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD. KIDS CLIMB OVER OUR FENCES INTO THESE BLIGHTED HOMES FULL OF HAZARDOUS LEAD NASS BESTEST HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVE NEEDS BLIGHTED HOMES. THERE IS NO. STRUCTURE OR FUNDING MECHANISM. OR THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE KEPT THE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTEEN BLIGHTED HOMES FROM BEING TAKEN DOWN THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM OR CITY IN THE CONTINUATION OF FOUR DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WE'VE HEARD WE HAVE A HIGH HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS INNER CITY. FOURS POLICIES HAMPER ABILITY TO ADDRESS. AFFORDABLE IN WORKING CLASS HOUSING THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE MOVING FORTNER CITY ENTRY LEVEL HOUSING. IS ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE. A TWO HUNDRED ACRE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS SITTING VACANT TUNING THIRTY TWO BLIGHTED HOMES ADJACENT TO THE OCEAN. AND DEVELOPERS A COME IN THEY WANT TO START BUILDING THOSE HOMES AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S WHERE CANCELS OUT BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES IN THE OBLIGATIONS THE CONSTRAINTS PUT ON US BY THE FOUR DEGREES ACT. OUR COUNCIL SAID NO BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP THAT PROPERTY OPEN TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO AS LONG AS FOR EXIST WE CANNOT PUT THE PLAN AND THE MECHANISMS THE FUNDING TOGETHER. THAT ALLOWS TO BUILDAFFORDABLE WORKING MIDDLE CLASS HOMES AND SO IT WILL SIT THERE. AND SO IN CONCLUSION. WELL ANOTHER TWO YEARS MAY NOT SEEM SIGNIFICANT IN IN THE TWENTY SIX YEARS OF FOR HAS BEEN EXISTENCE BUT THAT TWO YEARS. IS SIGNIFICANT TO US IMPLIED THAT TWO YEARS IS X. SIGNIFICANT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- MARINA AND THE CITY OF SEASIDE CITY COUNCIL WE BOTH UNANIMOUS UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSE THE EXTENSION FOR THANK YOU. SHE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AT CENTER BELLS WITHDRAW THEM WITHDRAW THE MOTION WILL CALL FOR MOTION JUST A BIT WE'D LIKE TO BE A TO GIVE CENTER MONEY AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT MARINA HAS DONE IN CONVERSION OF SOME OF THE FORMER MILITARY BASE. I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT. THE LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. IS CONSISTENT WITH A VOTE TAKEN BY THE FOR A BOARD FOR IS A REGIONAL ENTITY. IN THE DECISIONS IN TRANSITION HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AND NOT AS THEY AFFECT ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTION BUT OUR ENTIRE REGION. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PREVENTS MARINA FOR MOVING FORWARD -- IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO CONTRACT ITS ABILITY. TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING OBLIGATIONS AND PLANTS WE DO BELIEVE THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THE PLANS TRANSITION THAT IS IS DIRECTED. TO BENEFIT THE ENTIRE REGION AND IN PROTECTING. SOME OF THE COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT FEENEY RESOURCES AND PROPERTY TAX RESOURCES -- THAT WILL BE DIRECTED BY THE REDUCED ABOARD REDUCED OVERHEAD AND COST AND REALLY PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF MOVING RESOURCES. TO THE MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT STILL TOUCH FOR THE WORD AND IT WILL HAVE A SEAT ON THE REDUCED BOARD -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST ASK IF IT WOULD WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHO LAMAR TO ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED I THANK YOU RECORD REFER BRIEFLY IF YOU DON'T MIND -- IMMER VERY BRIEFLY I WOULD JUST ADD THE TWO TWO QUICK COMMENTS SO THAT IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IN SENATOR MINING'S BILL SUSTAINS THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. FOR THE REGION TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE ISSUES INCLUDED IN OUR PROGRAM FROM HABITAT CONSERVATION TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION WHICH YOU HEARD EARLIER IS ANOTHER PART OF OUR PROGRAM. TO THE TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT ISSUES. TO THE BUILDING A MOBILE APP EFFORTS THOSE ARE ALL INCLUDED AS A POTENTIAL FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE RESOURCES AT THE BILL IF THE BILL GOES FORWARD. MR EXECUTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH WITH THAT GOING TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR WE WELCOME A MOTION ON THE ON THE FLOOR. YEAH PLEASE CENTER BASED ON WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO YOU NEW ADDRESS THOUGH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE ALL THE? THE OLD BUILDINGS WHAT'S THE PLAN. FOR WE HAVE HAD. TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH FORMER MILITARY BASEWE THOUGHT ABOUT THE ARMY GAVE US THE PROPERTY THEY SAID THE DO WE COULD HAVE IT AT A REDUCED COST HOWEVER. THE COST OF REMOVING THE BUILDINGS IS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. JUST IN THE CITY MARINO LOAN THAT THE COST WE ESTIMATED IN ONE PROJECT TO BE -- IN EXCESS OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPLEX THAT WE HAVE TAKEN RESOURCE OF FROM MARLIN SALES REVENUES AND APPLIED THEM DIRECTLY TO BUILDING REMOVAL. WE'VE DONE OVER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF BUILDING REMOVAL TO DATE THAT'S NOT TO SAY WERE FINISHED BECAUSE WE STILL THINK THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE LEFT TO GO. AND SENATORS THE SENATORS BILL WOULD ENABLE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE BUILDING MOBILE WORK WHICH ARE JUST UNDERTAKING A STUDY RIGHT NOW WHICH SHOULD BE WITH US WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS -- YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE OTHER CITIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO REMOVE ALL THESE OLD BUILDINGS YES SENATOR AND I BELIEVE THOSE JURISDICTIONS HAVE REQUESTED THAT WE UNDERTAKE THOSE STUDIES AND WE WILL HAVE THAT BACK TO THE FULL BOARD WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS.

WE HAD CITY MAP FALL TO SIXTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS. IN A TIME PERIOD BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE. WE SOUGHT 80% DECLINE. IN OUR DONATIONS. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS IS I BELIEVE YOU KNOW AS WELL THAT TAX INFORMATION THOSE DONATIONS ARE PROTECTED. UNDER THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE DONORS ARE. SO WHAT I ATTEMPT TO DO UNFORTUNATELY AS AS YOU POINT OUT USE MY MEMBERS.

DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. AND THE FRENCH A TRIP YOU COULD TO THE ROLE MADAM SECRETARY. MORE LOCK. I OKAY [inaudible] ONE ZERO PART OF BY THE WAY THERE. THANK YOU VERY ROLE OPEN THANK YOU I'M SORRY DID I GIVE YOU CLOSING COMMENTS. OKAY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND AND THANK YOU FOR OUR FOR PASSING THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SENATE RUBIO FOR GIVING ME A LITTLE TIME. TO DISCUSS IT WITH MISTER POINTER. I LOST MY FRIENDS USED. OUR NEXT BILL IS. FIVE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU SB FIVE TWENTY EIGHT THE WORLD FAMOUS SENATOR. BEN HUESO. IF YOU HAVE THE FLOOR CARE AND I GUESS WHAT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THIS ONE IS JUST YOU AND ME. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. IT'S ALWAYS VERY THE I'M VERY EAGER TO SUCCEED ONE DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK COMMISSION AND PLACE THE AYE BANK UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE PURPOSES. OF INITIATING BANKING ACTIVITY IN IN -- REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER LOCAL MUNICIPAL. AND AND COUNTY AGENCIES OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SWITCHED OF PARTICIPATE IN THIS INSTITUTION. IT'S A LIMITED -- TO GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY. BUT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE AYE BANK BE CHARTERED AS A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. AND AUTHORIZES TREASURER. A STATE OFFICER LOCAL AGENTS HERE UPON THE APPROVAL OF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A QUALIFY PUBLIC. NONPROFIT ENTITY TO ESTABLISH A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT WHAT THE BANK. SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ESTABLISH HERE -- ACCORDING TO RECENT ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA WOULD BE TO INVEST MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND PUBLIC FACILITIES TO SERVE A GROWING POPULATION. UPGRADING SCHOOL. THE SCHOOLS UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS MAINTAINING HIGHWAYS AND PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND MAKING THE WATER SYSTEMATICALLY. RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION MOST OF THIS WILL COME IN THE FORM OF OF LOANS AND BONDS. AND THE HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE GO OUT TO THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT THE MARKET WILL. PROVIDE US LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS. BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE CAN CONTROL THAT IF WE DECIDE WE HAD THE DESIRE. BUT I WAS HERE -- NOT I WASN'T HERE WHEN I WHEN THE THE I WAS I CAME TO LEGISLATURE WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE OAKLAND A BIT BRIDGE. COMMENCED. AND BACK THEN THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT AT TO ART BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND. BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S INTEREST RATES AT THE TIME THE CREDIT RATING THEY COULDN'T FIND. A CAPITAL TO BUILD UP THE BRIDGE IT WAS -- A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE AT THE TIME. AND AND WHERE DID WE GO FOR THE REST OF FOR THE LOAN FOR THAT MONEY WE WENT TO CHINA AND CHINA GAVE US LOWER INTEREST WITH THE CONDITION THAT THE MAJORITY OF THAT BRIDGE BE BUILT IN CHINA. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT. THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING THAT BRIDGE AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE MEANT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT TO LOCAL WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BUILD THAT BRIDGE BY LOCAL -- CONTRACTORS HERE CALIFORNIA AND TO SPEND OUR MONEY LOCALLY IN OUR ECONOMY WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE DONE NINE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN OUR OWN STATE. AND THAT WAS LOST [inaudible] THAT BRIDGE. WAS COMPLETED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR I'M SORRY THAT DIDN'T THE NUMBER SIX POINT FOUR BILLION. BUT SIX POINT FOUR BILLION IS STILL. ON EARTH LOAD OF MONEY. AND END OF END WELL THERE WERE SOME LOCAL JOBS WITH WITH WITH WITH THAT CONSTRUCTION THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. AND THOSE INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE STAYED HERE IN OUR LOCAL BANKS IN FACT IF WE HAD A STATE BANK THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED. IN OUR OWN STATE'S BUDGET. AND USED TO CUT UP A PROVIDE OTHER LOANS TOWARD MUNICIPALITIES SO IN ESSENCE WHAT IS MY BILL DO MY BILL ALLOWS FOR US TO CHARTER BANK DEPOSIT OUR STATE FUNDS. INTO THAT BANK AND ISSUE LOANS TO MUNICIPALITIES -- IF YOU JUST CONSIDERED IT IF WE JUST DEPOSITED OUR RESERVES WHAT OUR RESERVES TO IN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SITTING IN AN ACCOUNT. NON PERFORMING. RIGHT NOW THE INTEREST RATE I THINK THAT WERE RECEIVING AS LESS THAN 1%. THIS IS NOTHING WORRY WERE BASICALLY PAIN -- WE'RE GETTING ALMOST NOTHING ON OUR MONEY. BUT IT JUST LIST LIST THINK FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS DEPOSITED INTO AYE AYE BANK. WOULD MAKE FOURTEEN BILLION IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES FOR LET'S SAY. WHAT IF WE WANTED TO CHARGE 1% OR ONE POINT 5%? AT ONE POINT 5% WERE LOOKING A BIT AT A BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS THAT WE WOULD DEPOSIT. INTO OUR AYE BANK. BUT THAT WOULD ALSO SAVE THOSE INSTITUTIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INTEREST RATES GO UP. WHEN THEY GO UP? AND AND AND SOME OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE BEST CREDIT RATINGS COULD BE PAIN. FIVE SIX SEVEN MAYBE MORE PERCENT ON BONDS WE COULD GIVE THEM MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE RATES. AND STILL MAKE A RETURN AND WE'RE BANKING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT [inaudible] CAN'T FAIL. SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT RISKY LOANS -- WILL YES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT THEY GOING TO BACKROOM C. BUT WHEN THEY DO -- BANKRUPTCY JUST MEANS REORGANIZATIONS FOR CITIES IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS I'VE NEVER SEEN. A GOVERNMENT AGENCY GO OUT OF BUSINESS IT'S VERY RARE BUT EVEN IN THAT OF THEN WE WOULD BE CVERED -- BECAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS WOULD BE VERY HIGH THERE BE ERY LOW RISK AND RETURN RATE WILL COVER FOR THAT BUT I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU THINK THAT THAT. THE RISK -- BY APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT REALLY ISN'T BECAUSE WERE REALLY OF BUT YOU KNOW IN THE ACT WHEN WHEN WE WE MAKE TO HAVE MADE IT HARDER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RAISE CAPITAL THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. WE'VE ELIMINATED -- REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE'VE ELIMINATED A LOT OF A LOT OF GRANT PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY TO FEDERAL LEVEL WERE NOT SEEN A LITTLE FURTHER. A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS GO TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO FOR THEM AND UP ANDUP AND UP ALLOWING THEM TO GET VERY LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS. AND USING MONEY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT'S ON DEPOSIT. BUT IMAGINE IF WE JUST TO BE A POSITIVE FOURTEEN BILLION WE WOULD HAVE FOURTEEN BILLION IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND LEVERAGE BOWL -- WE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY TO LEVERAGE TOLD THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHICH ALLOWS TOMORROW I DON'T SUGGEST THAT WE BORROW. BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T NEED TO BORROW -- IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY THOUGH HOWEVER OUR BANK WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BORROW FROM THE RESERVE WHICH IS A VERY NORMAL PRACTICE FOR EVERY SINGLE BANK IN THIS NATION. BUT I'M SAYING WE'RE BIG ENOUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OUR WHAT I MEAN TODAY LOOKING AT OUR OUR BUDGET THAT WERE PUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED AND NINETY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IF WE DEPOSIT THAT AND TO OUR STATE. OWNED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE WOULD SAVE US A STATE. AND IF WE LOANED A PORTION OF IT THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE COULD RETURN TOWARD GENERAL FUND. I HAVE USED IN A ON A NORMAL SICK ON MANY OCCASIONS THE THE NORTH DAKOTA BANK THEY HAVE ARGUED WELL IF YOU ARE OPEN TO STATE BANK BANKS WILL CLOSE. IN NORTH DAKOTA STATE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE LARGEST PER CAPITA BANK. OF RATIO IN THE COUNTRY IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE INDOOR DAKOTA BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY FELT WELL. WE'RE NOT GONNA WE DON'T WANT -- TO A GAUGE IN BANKING ACTIVITY BUT WE WILL ALLOW DEPOSITS TO BE USED AND THEY THEY WORK THROUGH THEIR LOCAL BANKS TO TO GIVE LOANS TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY WORK TO LOCAL BANKS. AND SO THEY HAVE ALMOST NO EXPENSES ALL THEY DO IS DEPOSIT. THERE THERE ARE -- THE MONEY IN THE BANK THEY USE IT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND AND AND TWENTY YEARS WITH THE STATE OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THEY HAVE RETURNED A BILLION DOLLARS OF PROFIT. TO THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR STATE A BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS WHAT ENGAGE IN AND NO ACTIVITY AT ALL JUST. USING MONEY TO TO GET -- TO GIVE IT LOW INTEREST RATES TO BANKS IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHICH IS A HUGE SERVICE FOR THE BANKS IN THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE BANKS IN THE COMMUNITY COULD GET. VERY LOW INTEREST RATE MONEY THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE PAY FOR FOR MORE FOR ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE. SO WE CAN DO BETTER IN ALL I'M ASKING YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GIVEN IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THIS BILL. BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD BE SO GREAT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'D BE GREAT. FOR THE CITIES IN THE COUNTIES AND AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE GONNA BE EMBARKING IN LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO GO TO BOND MARKETS. WE'VE DONE SO MUCH REFORM ON BOND REFORM AND WHAT. AND AND SO MUCH REFORM ON ON TAXATION. WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPTION THIS WILL SAVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS? MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THIS IS CALCULATED STATEWIDE. IT WOULD STATE SAVE OUR STATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT WOULD HELP US TO MOVE FASTER. TOWARD REPLACING OUR AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND AND ALSO HELP HELPING TO SAVE MONEY IN THAT PROCESS AND RAISE MONEY FOR GENERAL FUND OR JUST KEEP THE MONEY IN THE AND THE STATE BANK AND AS THAT FUND GROWS TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY USE A FOR MORE. A PUBLIC BENEFIT OF PROJECTS SO I HAVE LOTS TO SAY THIS ALL ARE CUT MY COMMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT WITNESSES ON THIS AND I JUST WANNA. US STATE. YOU KNOW. THE OPPOSITION IS STATED THE EXPANSION. OF THE AYE BANK. TO TWO OF THAT WOULD BE VERY COSTLY. AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT IT'S COSTLY IN AND THAT'S ITS ONLY COSTLY WHEN YOU MAKE A TRANSFER OF MONEY. ONE ACCOUNT TO THE OTHER SIDE HOW MUCH THAT COSTS NOTHING BUT IF YOU LIST. FOURTEEN BILLION AS OUR DEPOSIT THEY'RE GONNA LIST WITH LOTS OF COST. BECAUSE IN ESSENCE THERE ARE WE ALREADY HAVE AN AYE BANK THAT'S OPERATING. THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ISSUING LOANS THAT HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED ALREADY IN PLACE ALL WE NEED TO DO IS DEPOSIT SOME MONEY IN THERE. FROM THE MINUTE WE DEPOSIT THE MONEY INTO THE AYE BANK WELL. THERE ARE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF ESTABLISHING THE BANK AND THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE ABSORBED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF REVENUES. BECAUSE WOULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR TO PAY FOR THAT AND IT'S WORTH. GIVING THE AYE BANK ALONE. FIRST TO FUND START UP COSTS THAT WILL RECOVER IN THE FIRST YEAR. OF ISSUE IN LOANS. BUT IF WE EVEN WANTED TO USE JUST -- I MEAN MODELED AFTER THE NORTH DAKOTA BANK. WE WOULD HAVE. OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF OF DISCRETION TO TARGET MONEY INTO OUR CITIES AT VERY LOW INTEREST RATES AND THAT IS THE ALSO -- THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DEPOSIT IN THE STATE BANK THAT THAT COULDN'T IF THEY HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP THE LOCAL BANK THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT -- IT DOES NOT SEEK TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL FINANCING OPTIONS -- THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCING OFF OPTIONS FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEPOSIT WHAT THE STATE. TO OBTAIN THOSE IT'LL BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MONEY SO IT COULD BE A WIN WIN. THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DEPOSIT THEY CAN STILL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR AYE BANK IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. THEY CAN -- YOU HAVE THEIR MONEY BE USED FOR THEIR PURPOSES SO. I I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS WE HAVE ALLEN BROWN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC BENT BANKING IS TO TO HEAR TO ADD TO MY REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYWAY SO IT TOOK A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE CENTER HUESO FIRST PASSION IS FOCUS ON THIS AS WELL VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR SIR IN APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO COULD BE HEARING COMMITTEE TODAY. WE WELCOME YOU MAN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS IF YOU DON'T MIND IS INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN ORGANIZATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I'D THANK YOU SENATOR I SO IT'S WELL FOR HIS CASH IT'S GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN HE BROUGHT THE FIRST BILL AND THAT'S GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT THAT GREW OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BANKING CRISIS. AND IS GENERATING GROWING INTEREST PARTICULARLY AMONG A NEW GENERATION OF MILLENNIALS WHO ARE DEMANDING REAL CHANGE IN HOW BANKING IS PRACTICE TODAY. IN THE LAST DECADE MANY BILLS HAVE BEEN FILED AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES DONE NATIONWIDE. FOR PUBLIC BANKS INCLUDING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE BUT THE ONE THAT APPEARS TO BE THE MOST PROMISING AT THE MOMENT IS THIS. ONE IT WOULD SIMPLY TRANSFORM THE EXISTING AYE BANK INTO A DEPOSITARY BANK EXPANDING ITS CAPACITY TO MAKE SAFE AND PRUDENT INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS. AT BELOW MARKET RATES WELL PAYING ITS MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT DEPOSITORS ABOVE MARKET RATES. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM IS A STRONG ADVOCATE OF ITS STATE ON BANKING AND HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE AYE BANK APPROACH PARTICULARLY. ARE CONTRADICTED TENSIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA MAKING ASSERTION VISION A DEPOSITARY AYE BANK WOULD NOT COMPETE WITH LOCAL CALIFORNIA BANKS OR TAKE DEPOSITS AWAY FROM THE LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND. WHICH INVESTS LONGER TERM DEPOSITS IN LOCAL BANKS IN THIS CASE THE AYE BANKS COMPETITORS WOULD BE WEALTHY BOND HOLDERS WHO FIND INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS WHILE AVOIDING STATE TAXES. AND VERY LARGE OUT OF STATE OR MULTINATIONAL BANKS THAT NOW HANDLE ABOUT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEPOSIT TRANSACTIONS. FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENTS AND THOSE BANKS AND NOW ARE GETTING ONE OR TWO POINT 4%. INTEREST ON THEIR RESERVES AT WHICH THEY ARE PARKING AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHICH IS LIKE. MANY THEY'RE NOT LENDING OUT THERE GETTING TWO POINT 4% ON FROM THE FED. AND THEY'RE PAYING OUR ON OUR PUBLIC DEPOSITS ALMOST NOTHING. FINANCING IS HALF THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AYE BANK CAN REDUCE THEIR COSTS BY 50%. LEE HAS ONLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO LAND. OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WERE USED INSTEAD TO CAPITALIZE A BANK AND A 10% CAPITAL REQUIREMENT IT COULD LAND FOR BILLION DOLLARS. IT WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED DEPOSITS OF A FEW BILLION THIS SORT OFDEPOSITS THAT ARE NOW TRANSFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. BUT OFFERING CLIENTS HIGHER INTEREST AND ACCESS TO BELOW MARKET LOANS WOULD ATTRACT THE NECESSARY DEPOSIT. THE BANK DOES NOT HAVE TO BE STARTED FROM SCRATCH THE AYE BANK HAS A FIFTEEN YEAR SUCCESS RECORD EXPERIENCED STAFF AND DETAILED PROCEDURES. DEMAND FOR ITS LOANS IS THIRTY TIMES WHAT IT CAN CURRENTLY SERVICE. ITS CUSTOMERS ARE VERY LOW RISK CONSISTING SOLELY OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IT IS PROJECTED TO BE PROFITABLE BY YEAR. THREE RATHER THAN FINDING A FEASIBILITY STUDIES THE POSSIBILITIES COULD BE EXPLORED BY A TRANSITION TEAM DRAWN FROM AYE BANK PERSON OUT. DURING THE TWO TO THREE YEARS NEEDED TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE NOT GONNA WELCOME GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE GONNA WELCOME FOLKS WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD FIRST LASSEN ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING. KATIE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRACY COLLABORATIVE SPONSORED THE BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU IN THAT SHOULD BE GOOD AFTERNOON SORRY. JERRY BROWN ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THINK INSTAGRAM. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. I DON'T CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING UP THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE WE'VE TWO SEATS IN THE FRONT. WE'RE GONNA ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN FIVE MINUTES. SECONDARY WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN YOUR ORGANIZATION. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER KAREN J. SETTLING WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO SPEAK ON BEHALF THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE MEAURE. MUCH OF WHAT WAS SAID BY -- THE SENATOR AND THE SPONSORS SORT OF IGNORES SOME PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL BANKING PRINCIPLES. ON THE NOTION THAT WE COULD TAKE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND DEPOSITED AND THEN LOAN IT OUT IGNORES THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TONS OF COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS ASSESSMENTS ON FDIC INSURANCE SO THERE'S THERE ARE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING -- OR CONVERTING THE AYE BANK INTO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION -- THAT DIDN'T GET DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IN OUR VIEW THIS IS CLEARLY A A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM THE AE BANK FUNCTIONS -- VERY WELL -- IS OUR INSTITUTIONS PARTNER WITH THE I. BANK. THROUGH THEIR LOAN SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM WHICH IS A VERY ROBUST PROGRAM IT OPERATES IN A VERY EFFICIENT MANNER -- UNDER THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE THE GOVERNOR -- UNDERGO BUSINESS AND IN OUR VIEW THAT SHOULD REMAIN -- AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR IS ONE THAT I THINK IS A BIT ROM THE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A HEAD SCRATCHER WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE -- HOW OLD THE NUMBERS PENCIL OUT AND THE GOAL IS TO TAKE TAXPAYER DOLLARS WHICH I WOULD SAY ALSO INCLUDE PENSION INVESTMENTS -- PUT THEM IN A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THEN PAY DEPOSITORS AN INTEREST RATE THAT IS HIGHER THAN COMMERCIAL BANKS WOULD PROVIDE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN A COMMERCIAL BANK WOULD PROVIDE. ALL THE WHILE MAINTAINING CAPITAL. CAPITAL RESERVES AND COLLATERAL A AND THE OPERATIONS COST ASSOCIATED WITH -- ALL THE COMPLIANCE THAT GOES ALONG WITH OPERATING A BANK. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE INSTITUTION -- IT IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN MAKE THAT TYPE OF DEAL PENCIL OUT -- WITHOUT MASSIVE LOSSES -- IT THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE PROPONENTS TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY BRING UP FOR DAKOTA -- AND THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING. EXAMPLE -- I'D REMIND FOLKS THAT NORTH DAKOTA AS A STATE ITS GDP IS THE SIZE OF OXNARD IT IS LITERALLY 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S GDP. WHAT THE PROPONENTS DIDN'T TELL YOU IS THAT NORTH DAKOTA LOST MONEY FOR A DECADE BEFORE IT EVEN BROKE EVEN -- AND MANY% DOUBT -- THAT THAT BANK WHICH BY THE WAY WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN BEFORE -- THE LET ME OF REGULATIONS THAT THE CAR BANKS BANKING INDUSTRY OPERATES UNDER. MANY DOUBT THAT WOULDN'T EVEN EXIST TODAY -- GIVEN THE REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS -- AGAIN I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL POSES A TREMENDOUS RISKS TO TAXPAYER DOLLARS THESE ARE LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSITS THE COMMUNITY BANKS USE AND LEANED BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITY -- AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT TAKES AWAY A VITAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR COMMUNITY BANKS AND IT PUTS THEM IN A STATE BANK THAT HAS NO PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN ANY OF YOUR COMMUNITIES. FOR THIS REASON WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE. HE WAS FINE WHEN I WOULD LIKE YOU TO WALK UP TO ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MICROPHONE. I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE I SAID SUPPORT I'M IN OPPOSITION I APOLOGIZE MA'AM YOUR MIND IS GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AN ORGANIZATION. YEAH -- I TWEENER ALRIGHT. GALLERY NARAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE TWEENER WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS BILL. WE HAVE A VERY FINE POINTED INTEREST IN THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN ASPECTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH GRATEFUL. ANYONE ELSE IT MAY BE SQUISHY END OR OPPOSE IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME LAST CALL. WE NOW LIKE TO BE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR A MOTION TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM COMMITTEE. HEARING. CENTER ABOUT -- JUST ANSWER WAS SO THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH -- THE HOUSING. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS -- THE INABILITY TO BORROW -- MONEY TO FINANCE -- PROJECTS. WHETHER PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS SO -- HOUSING IS A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- PROGRAMS FOR COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND AREAS THAT NEED TO BE -- YOU KNOW UPGRADED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROVIDE JOBS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF WITH THE THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK. HAVE MAYBE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. OF AND BENEFIT TO THE STATE -- IN THOSE AREAS VERSUS A REGULAR BANK. NOW MY HOPE IS THAT ONE DAY THEY COULD. AND MY HOPE IS THAT ONE DAY -- WE COULD ESTABLISH PRIORITIES. THROUGH OUR BANKS LIKE THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WOULD THAT PROVIDE STUDENT LOANS HOUSING LOANS BUSINESS LOANS ON SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. AND YOU KNOW AND THEIR LETTER AND IN -- THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY THE BANK IN THAT INDUSTRY WILL HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS AND THAT I I HAVE FAILED TO IDENTIFY HOW THE CURRENT MARKET OUR MARKETPLACE IS NOT MEETING THE THE NEEDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT. THEN THEN THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE. WORKING WITH LOCAL BANKS WAS CITY IS CITY GOVERNMENTS. NEITHER ARE THEY GIVING THE LOANS -- TO THE THE THE SMALL BUSINESS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OR ARE THEY PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO CITIES ON BANKING THAT. ARE. OUR OUR FREE OF OF COST. WHEN I WHEN I? THANK BACK WHEN I WAS ON CITY COUNCIL WE HAD AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS APPROVED WHAT'S UP BANK OF AMERICA AND IT WAS A VERY FAVORABLE AGREEMENT TO THEM AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THEY DOING. IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY SAID THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT. OBLIGATED TO DO ANYTHING. AND AND WORDS WERE ACTUALLY DOING YOU A FAVOR BECAUSE MANAGING YOUR MONEY IS A LIABILITY IF THAT IS TRUE. AND THAT THAT'S WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT MEETING AND THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING THIS BILL. WE CAN DO MORE WE CAN WE CAN DO A LOT MORE BUT IF WE JUST FOCUS. ON ON ON HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SAVE MONEY. THROUGH THROUGH THIS OPTION. WE WOULD BE DOING A TREMENDOUS SERVICE A CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXIST IN THE IN THE MARKET PLACE NOW. OF ANOTHER LIKE WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR ON MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THE GOVERNMENT DEPOSIT MONEY IN THE PRIVATE BANKS -- AND AT ONE POINT -- WE WERE DISCUSSING OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM. NO WOMEN AND CHILDREN MANLY -- THEY WANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW CAL WHICH IS A SMALL. PROGRAM AND WE WE WANTED TO HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS -- MADE MORE EFFICIENT SO WE WE WE DECIDED TO HAVE. THEIR DEPOSITS IN USING ATM FOR THE CAL WORKS -- FUNDING AND SO FORTH -- AND WE SAID WELL WE LIKE TO DEPOSIT ARE FUNDS HERE AND THEN HAVE [inaudible] BANKS SO. WAIVE THE FEES FOR THE ATM ON THE CAL WORKS [inaudible] TRANSACTIONS. AND THEY REFUSE TO DO SO CHAU. THE COUNTY -- PUT ON HIS AGENDA. THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD REMOVE OUR DEPOSITS FROM MANY BANKS THAT REFUSE -- TO ABIDE BY OUR DECISION NOT TO CHARGE -- A FEE AND SO WHEN WE WITH. ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION AND WE HAVE THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY NOT JUST -- TO MAKE EARNINGS WE HAVE THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. TO THROUGH THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THERE'S A TOOL RESPONSIBILITY -- IS NOT THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY OF BANCOS. DO YOU THINK THAT -- THESE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT X. -- WOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT IF THIS BILL WAS APPROVED. I GAVE THE EXAMPLE EARLIER IMAGINE IF THE STATE DEPOSITED JUST OUR RESERVES FOURTEEN BILLION IN RESERVES MONEY THAT WE HAD LIKE A TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SO. THE COUNTY CASH RESERVES SO WE WERE. WELL RIGHT THEN IMAGINE IF THEY DEPOSITED THEIR RESEARCH AND THEY ONE OF THE ONLY WORK FROM RESERVES HOW MANY HOW MUCH MONEY COULD WE RAISE. FOR FOR LOW INTEREST. BONDS LOANS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AND THOSE THOSE THOSE PROJECTS COULD FIND THE OVER. YOU KNOW SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION THAT ARE ARE ARE ALL THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE OVER THE NEXT DECADE ACROSS THE STATE. SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION AND INFRASTRUCTURAL UNMET NEEDS THAT OUR ROADS SCHOOLS. LIBRARIES PARKS THINGS THAT ARE ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR STATES OPERATION. IF WE COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE THAT WE OFFER TO FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PROJECTS THINK AND AND WE CUT OUT THE RED TAPE IN TERMS OF HOW HAVING ACCESS TO THIS MONEY THINK ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THAT WE COULD DO FOR OUR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS [inaudible] WHEN WHEN? WHEN IT WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS A POOR CREDIT RATING? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THEY PAY A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WE CAN YOU KNOW. WHY DO WE PUNISH GOVERNMENTS? NEVER GO OUT OF BUSINESS GOVERNMENT'S CITIES COUNTIES AB HAVE YOU HAS A COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA EVER GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND IF THEY HAVE AN THAT INTEREST RATE. IS THERE A RISK THAT THEY CAN'T REPEAT LOS HAVE IT HAS A CITY OR COUNTY EVER DEFAULTED ON A LOAN. YET THE WE STOOD THERE STILL SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RATING. OF FORMULAS WE CAN WE CAN BY PASS THAT AS A STATE AND GIVE THEM. A LOWER INTEREST RATE LOANS. AND AND THEY CAN REPAIR THEM AND THEY'RE JUST SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN BENEFIT. A DRUG BENEFIT FROM IN A IN A IT IN THE IN YOU IN USING OUR BY BANK. MORE WISELY USING A TO DO A PUBLIC GOOD USE IN ITS DEPOSIT. ALL OF OUR STATE OF THE THE IF JUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USED THE I BAG JUST TO DEPOSIT ITS OWN. BUDGET THINK ABOUT. HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD SAVE IN? OUR MEDI CAL THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR MEDICAL. PROGRAM WE HAVE WE COULD USE OUR ALLY BANK TO LEVERAGE LOAN TO DRAW REVENUE AND THAT REVENUE COULD FIND ANYTHING THAT WE WANT. INCLUDING BALANCING OUR BUDGET OR JUST KEEP IT IN THE BANK AND USE THAT. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LOANS FOR OUR COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND WE COULD OFFER LOW INTERESTED IN. LOANS I MEAN THERE'S I JUST SEE SO MUCH POTENTIAL. BUT IF IF THE IT'S IT'S IT'S UP TO THIS LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE AN APPETITE FOR EXPANDING THE THE AUTHORITY OF THE AYE BANK. I MEAN WHAT ARE. I JUST THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING IT WOULD BE FOOLISH OF NOT OF US NOT TO TRY. AND THE COSTS ARE SO MINIMAL. THE COSTS ARE SO MINIMAL THEY CAN EASILY BE -- PAID AND REPAID. AND THEN. I WE COULD HAVE REVENUE OFFSET THOSE COSTS. AND IF IT'S GONNA COST TAKE FIVE YEARS -- TO TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS A PROFIT IT'S WORTH. IT'S IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT IS ENORMOUS THANK YOU CENTER. GERMAN -- I THINK THAT -- THIS BILL WAS WORTHY OF PUSHING AHEAD. I DON'T KNOW -- COMMENTS FROM THE OTHER MEMBERS BUT I WOULD MAKE A MOTION. TO ALLOW THE BILL TO PROCEED AND APPROVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DOUG VERY GRATEFUL SAN ABOUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR BUT WE DO HAVE A FORMAL MOTION THE FLOOR WHICH IS TO PASS TO BANKING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WERE IN TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MISS BROWN THANK YOU FOR COMING THANK YOU FOR THE BOOKS ONE OF YOUR FANS SENT ME A COPY I SHOULD HAVE A BETTER KNOWN YOU WERE HERE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT TO HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH AT THE TIME. I JUST WISH HAD BEEN HERE WHEN I WAS TREASURER OF THE COUNTY OF ORANGE I ACTUALLY STARTED OR TRY TO START A BANK CAME ABOUT THIS CLOSE I WON'T GIVE THE LONG STORY -- BUT THE ISSUE WAS WELFARE RECIPIENTS I HAD MY DISBURSEMENTS -- AND AND TO PUT DEPOSITORY BANKS JUST UNWILLING AB THEY DIDN'T WANT FIFTY THOUSAND WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN THEIR BRANCHES. THEY DON'T WANT THE DIAPERS THE THE MASS THEY WERE IT WAS IT WAS AN AMAZING PARADIGM THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH. SO -- SO I DECIDED MAYBE I SHOULD START MY OWN BANKING IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE -- IT BUT IT IT IT ACTUALLY WOULD PENCIL OUT. BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH ALL OF THE EXTRA WORK AND I I WON THE LABOR. IT YOU WITH THAT BUT HAVE FUN WORKING WITH THE BANKS INSTITUTION. DEPARTMENT FOR THE STATE WENT TO LA MET WITH. REPRESENTATIVES FROM WHAT I HELP REDUCE CHECK CASHING COST SERVICES YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE WELFARE RECIPIENTS WERE GOING THEY'RE PAYING A LARGE AMOUNT. WOULD DO WOULD WE HAVE -- POINT OF SALE CARDS WOULD BE PRE PAY RENT AND AUTOMATICALLY PAY UTILITIES WE WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN. AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION. ARE THEY SAID HOW DID YOU FEEL OUR OF OUR OUR MEETING WENT I SAID WELL I THOUGHT THE FIRST. I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO THROW ME OUT AFTER MY FIRST. QUESTION LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING AND GET OUT OF HERE BUT WE HAD A P. I SEE APPROVAL BETTER RESERVE APPROVALS KIND OF AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. BUT ARE WE ALREADY HAVE THE MONEY AND WAVE I DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE. STATE TREASURER IS OUR STATE CONTROLLER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MONITOR THE CASH FLOW OF THE STATE -- BUT I I I HAD TO PUT TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN AND I I DON'T SEE THAT HERE AS WELL ON WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THAT WAS AN INTERESTING EXERCISE ASWELL AND ACTUALLY GET GREAT FEEDBACK I SHOWED IT. TO TWENTY SMALL BANK CEOS IN THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS THAT ONLY LIKE THAT THEY WANT TO BE ON MY BOARD WHICH IS. KIND OF FUNNY FOR GOVERNMENT. BUT THE GOVERNMENT GETTING INTO THIS ARENA IS IS RATHER DICEY IT'S RATHER INTERESTING YOU'VE YOU MENTIONED BANKRUPTCY A FEW TIMES I'VE BEEN THERE. TOO YOU KNOW THE COUNTY OF ORANGE DID FILE FOR CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY GUESTS WERE STILL IN BUSINESS. BUT WE WERE GENERATING REALLY NICE RETURNS FOR DEPOSITORS AND THEN AFTER THE COUNTY WOULD BANKRUPT AND REALIZE THAT THEIR FUNDS WERE PUT ON HOLD. YOU KNOW OPENING A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE RELEASING THOSE FRIENDS THAT. THAT WAS A KILLER THAT ONCE THE FUNDS COULD BE FREED THEY WERE THEY LEFT AND RIGHT HARDLY ANY CAME BACK. AND SO IT JUST GOT REALLY AWKWARD SO EVEN THE FEAR OF OF OF OF HAVING. A LOSS OF CONTROL WOULD BE. REAL ARE GREAT THAT'S WERE MAYBE A BUSINESS PLAN WOULD BE HELPFUL WITH SOME OF THESE. PROVISOS BUT CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT IN AN INTERESTING AREA WHERE WHEREVER YOU BEEN I'M GONNA BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AT THIS TIME. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR VISION. AND AND YOUR APPROACH BUT I'D. JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A HISTORICAL CONTEXT I'LL I'LL I'LL BE A LITTLE. APPREHENSIVE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR I WANNA TURN IT OVER TO THE CENTER TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND IF YOU'D LIKE WELL I'M. MOST OF US WOULD BE HARD PRESSED. TO MENTION. A BANKRUPTCY IN OUR STATE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MANY BUT EVEN WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. NOBODY HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. AND IT'S HARDER TO RECOVER MONEY FROM SOMEBODY. THAT HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND AND IN BANKRUPTCIES AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH. P. SO FEW OF THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING THAT A LARGE INSTITUTION. THANKS DEAL WITH THAT EVERY DAY THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS NOT ONLY THE DO THEY DEAL WITH. A MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCIES BUT THEY ALSO DEAL WITH CORPORATE BANKRUPTCIES. AND AND THEY ARE -- OBVIOUSLY STAY IN BUSINESS OUR AYE BANK IS ALREADY FORMED OUR AYE BANKS ALREADY BEEN ISSUING LOANS ARE AYE BANK HAS ALREADY BEEN HANDILY IN. MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND AND REVIEWS THEY ALREADY EXIST. WERE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE SIMPLY JUST TRANSFERRING MONEY FROM OUR STATE. BUDGET TO THE AYE BANK THAT'S ALL WE'RE REALLY REALLY DISCUSSING OF COURSE -- AS FAR AS GOING TO THE EXTENT OF GETTING THE ALL THE TECHNICAL APPROVALS. CALL US WHETHER WE START THE PROGRAM IS IS CONTINGENT ON ON GETTING THOSE TECHNICAL APPROVALS CAN WE DO IT ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE THE SKILL AND EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTELY. THE THE THAT IS NOT WHERE MY CONCERN LINES MY MY CONCERN IS TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND AND IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY. MUCH OF A CONCERN I MEAN. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE A E. WILL BANKS LOSE DEPOSITS ABSOLUTELY. BUT THEY'LL BE THEY'LL LOSE DEPOSITS ONLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT BEING COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER LOCAL CITIES. AND IF THEY'RE NOT OFFERING GOOD SERVICES THERE. LET'S GIVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANOTHER OPTION TO COME TO THE STATE WORK WITH US. AND IF AND IF THEY WORK WITH US AND GET BETTER RATES. BUT I I THINK THAT'S WHAT BANKS ARE MOSTLY AFRAID. AFRAID OF COMPETITION. AND EN I AGREE WE SHOULD FOLLOW EVERY RULE AND CROSS EVERY. WE LOOK AT EVERY DETAIL AND AND I THINK WITH THERE SHOULD BE A LEVEL PLAYING GROUND. BUT ALSO WHAT WHY DON'T EVERY TIME I MEAN THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF GOVERNMENT IS. TO IS TO POOL OUR RESOURCES AND GIVE THE PEOPLE. OF CALIFORNIA. A BETTER RETURN ON THEIR MONEY ON THEIR TAXES ON THEIR FEES. AND WHY HAVEN'T WE USE BANKING TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION THAT NOBODY CAN ANSWER BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS EQUATE IT WITH RISK. YEAH OUT EVERYTHING HAS A RISK CREATING OF GOVERNMENT HAS A RISK PROVIDING SERVICES HAS A RISK. BUT TEST FIT HERE AND SAY THAT IT WOULD BE A RISK TO DEPOSIT TAXPAYER FUNDS. INTO A STATE BANK BUT IT'S NOT A WRIST TO DEPOSITED INTO. A PRIVATE BANK THAT'S NOT A RISK.

TO RECEIVE THE SAME PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT. AND RELIEF AS OTHER AGRICULTURE SECTORS IN THE STATE BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO THE WILLIAMSON ACT WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE AMENDMENTS AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA LAND CONSERVATION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE ALSO KNOWN AS THE WILLIAMSON ACT ESTABLISH A MEANS TO PROTECT THE AGRICULTURAL AND OPEN SPACE LAND BY REDUCING THE BURDENS IMPOSED BY REASON RISING PROPERTY TAX RATES. THE ACT ALLOWS PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO ENTER INTO CONTRACT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO VOLUNTARILY RESTRICT THEIR LAND TO AGRICULTURAL AND COMPATIBLE OPEN SPACE USES. THIS RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS WHICH ARE BASED UPON INCOME GENERATED RATHER THAN THE POTENTIAL MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS ACT SAVES AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS ANYWHERE FROM 2275% IN PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY EACH YEAR. HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THEIR DISCRETION ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH AG PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THE ACT. SB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND PROVIDE THAT THE CULTIVATION OF CANNABIS PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TYPES OF CULTIVATOR LICENSES ISSUED TO THE MEDICAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. IS A COMPATIBLE USE OF OF LAND UNDER WILLIAMSON ACT CONTRACT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE INCLUDE CANNABIS AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP.

MISTER BELL IT SB NINE MISTER WEINER WITH SB. FORTY EIGHT MISTER HERTZBERG AT SP. FOUR THIRTY EIGHT AND MISTER MOORE LOCKET. FIVE NINETY EIGHT SO WE ARE OFF AND RUNNING AND WE WELCOME CENTER SKINNER TO COMMITTEE ON A ALSO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY. FOR ALL OF OUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS -- IN IT'S EEN ABOUT COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION AND I JUST CANNOT SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH -- TO THE GOOD SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US I THE ENTIRE TIME THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU I'M CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE -- YES DEAD DILIGENCE THAT YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF SHOWED WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE AND I THINK WE GOT TO A GOOD SPOT AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT. AND NOW LET ME -- AS A SO I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WE CAN GO INTO A LITTLE DETAIL ON THOSE LATER BUT LET ME JUST SAY WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL. SB THREE THIRTY RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS. WHY ARE WE IN A CRISIS OR WHATEVER THE INDICATORS THAT DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT WE ARE IN THIS CRISIS WE ARE THE? FORTY NINE OUT OF OUR FIFTY STATES IN NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS PER CAPITA. THE PRICE OF A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO POINT FIVE TIMES THE U. S. AVERAGE SO MOST ANY OTHER STATE YOU GO TO YOU WILL PAY. LESS. AND YOU WILL HEAR PAY TWO POINT FIVE TIMES. OF THE FIFTY CITIES IN THE US WITH THE HIGHEST RENTS THIRTY THREE OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH I THINK ALL OF US ARE. IT WE CAN HARDLY LIVE WITH OURSELVES BECAUSE WE TO SEE IN THIS RICHEST NATION AND IN THIS STATE WHICH IS THE FIFTH HIGHEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. TO SEE PEOPLE. IN ON SIDEWALKS IN DOORWAYS AND INTENT ENCAMPMENTS WE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE COME TO THIS PLACE. WHY HAS HOMELESSNESS GREW 16% JUST FROM? TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THE COST OF HOUSING ARE TOO HIGH. THOSE NEWLY HOMELESS. ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT ADDICTED. THEY HAVE JOBS AND THEY HAVE NEVER BEFOREBEEN HOMELESS. THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA UNDER OUR CURRENT PRICES. KNOW WHAT MY BILL DOES IS RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE IN A CRISIS IF WE TAKE OTHER CRISES. FOR EXAMPLE ALL YOU SANTA ROSA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE AFTER THAT HORRIFIC FIRE AND SANTA ROSA LOST SO MANY HOUSING UNITS GENERAL'S A NEW. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO NORMAL SO THEY RELAXED SOME OF THE RULES THE STREAMLINED PROCESS SEES. GET IN THOSE HOMES BACK. WELL WE'RE NOT HERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET HOMES BACK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW. TO GET MORE UNITS ADDED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. NOW SB. THREE THIRTY WELL SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT OR THINK THAT IT'S AN OVER REACH IT'S REALLY A VERY MODEST MEASURE. BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER BILLS IT DOESN'T ASK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO CHANGE THEIR ZONING OR TWO IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS IT SAYS LOOK. IF WE LOOK AT YOUR EXISTING ZONING THERE IS A LOT HOUSING THAT COULD FEEL THAT YOU ARE ALREADY THROUGH YOUR GENERAL PLAN THROUGH YOUR SECRET DOCUMENTS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO ALLOW. SO WE'RE JUST SAYING OKAY. DO WHAT YOU DO BUT DO IT FASTER DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND TRIED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THE COST TO THE PERSON WHO IS BUILDING BECAUSE IF WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF THAT HOUSING. WE NEED BOTH MARKET RATE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED BOTH KINDS. BUT IF WE CAN [inaudible] STREAMLINED. AND NOT HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM. OR NOT ENACT GROWTH CAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD STOP AND GO BACKWARDS ON HOUSING. JUST FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD THIS BILL WOULD ONLY GOING TO AFFECT FOR TEN YEARS. THEN WE MIGHT HAVE THE HOPE OF GETTING. THE THREE MILLION. UNITS BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THIRTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ACTUALLY THAT GO UP BUT IT WILL IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO DO THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT STILL THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAYS WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT THE LA -- SAYS WE NEED EVERY REPORT THAT LOOKS AT OUR CRISIS SAYS WE NEED AT LEAST THREE MILLION MORE UNITS IN TEN OR SO YEARS SO HOW DO YOU GET THOSE FASTEST. BY LETTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY DONE BUT DO IT FASTER AND DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY. I WILL LET MY WITNESSES SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND THEN I'LL JUST BRIEFLY DETAIL WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE. WHAT IF YOU COULD PLEASE SEE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME ALONG WITH ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU COMMITTEE AND THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US IN YOUR PATIENCE AND? APOLOGIZE THAT WE'VE GONE IN THE AFTERNOON IT'S GOOD TO SEE. THE TERM ACQUIRE A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PATRICK I'LL FOLLOW AND I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE FORTY YEAR OLD OF A HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION I'M BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT WE DO ADVOCACY AND ALL NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES. AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE THIRTY TODAY BECAUSE NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THAT CALIFORNIA IS AN AFFORDABLE IS IN AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING EMERGENCY. AND BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR SENIORS VETERANS PEOPLE'S WITH THIS ABILITY IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND SB THREE THIRTY WILL BE A CRITICAL TOOL TO HELP MAKE THAT A REALITY. WE ALWAYS SAY IN OUR LINE OF WORK THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- LAND OF MONEY AND POLITICAL WELL AND SB THREE THIRTY WILL GREATLY HELP WITH THE POLITICAL WILL SIDE OF THE QUESTION. RIGHT NOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WITH ANY OTHER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL RULES -- AND WHILE WE ARE HPPY TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ARE SET BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES THOSE RULES ARE CHANGED MIDSTREAM. AND SB THREE THIRTY WILL CREATE MORE CLARITY THAT THE RULES UNDER WHICH THE PROJECT WAS APPROVED. I WILL NOT MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT IN BERKELEY WHERE AFTER HAD BEEN APPROVED THE CHANGE THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN. NEEDS TO SEEK MORE SUBSIDIES TO SUBSIDIZE ESSENTIALLY MORE PARKING UNIT. AND WE THINK THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS. TO IS TO SERIOUS FOR US TO THE LATE APPROVAL SUCH PROJECTS ANY LONGER. IN THE BAY AREA AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY. AND BY LIMITING THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO TWELVE MONTHS FOR NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS SB THREE THIRTY WILL GREATLY SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE HOMES -- AND FINALLY WE JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL CREATES MORE CLARITY AND CERTAINTY IN THE PROCESS AND THAT THIS WILL NOT ONLY HELP GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES BUILT. FOR OUR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO HELP BUILD MORE HOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL THAT ARE. SEVERELY NEED IT AND SELL -- WITH THAT OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU PLEASE SIR WELCOME. YOUR FIRST LESSON OPPOSITION TO MANY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA. I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE TURSUNOV ROUSING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL. THREE THIRTY I DON'T THINK I I NEED. TO LABOR THE POINT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE THROES OF A VERY DEEP AND WE'RE STAYING. HOUSING CRISIS AND A BILL SUCH AS SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY REPRESENT A BOLD STEP TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE HEAD ON TODAY MORE THAN 50% OF RENTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSIDERED RENT BURDENED. AND OF THOSE 30% ARE CONSIDERED SEVERELY RENT FOR IT. AND ON TOP OF THAT OWNING A HOME HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY UNACHIEVABLE AS WELL AS WE ARE WITNESSING. THE LOWEST RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES. AND AS OUR WORK AT THE TURNER CENTER HAS SHOWN THIS LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OFTENTIMES IS PUSHING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH IN MANY CASES MEANS THAT THEY'RE LEAVING THE STATE ENTIRELY. SO THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US REALLY DEMANDS POLICIES THAT MATCH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE THAT ARE AS BOLD. AS WHAT SENATE BILL. THREE THIRTY HOUSES SO BY PROHIBITING CITIES FROM ENACTING MORATORIUM'S OR OR DOWN ZONING THAT WOULD DIMINISH THE CAPACITY FOR YOU HOUSING WE'RE SENDING A CLEAR. AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE THAT WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO TOLERATE. LOOKING PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF ONGOING HOUSING PRESSURES. SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY WILL ALSO DO YOU VERY MUCH TO ADDRESS THE COST OF HOUSING BY MODIFYING HOWELL PARKING REQUIREMENTS ARE STRUCTURED. BY MODIFYING HOW FEES ARE IMPOSED AND BY CURBING OTHERWISE REQUIREMENTS OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER THESE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES CUMULATIVELY WILL RAISE THE COST TO BUILD NEW HOUSING? SO -- MANY CITIES CONTINUE TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME THAT RELY ON EXCLUSION PRACTICES TO SKIRT THERE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS SO WITH THAT I WILL SAY AGAIN WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VERY GRATEFUL WE KNOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE OF THE FRONT. WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION. GOOD AFTERNOON. THAT THERE MISTER MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US IN ADDRESSING SOME OF CONCERNS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS ERIN EVANS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA U. M. B. AND SILICON VALLEY AT HOME IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON SILVIO FOR OUR AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FACEBOOK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI FOR MANY WOULD LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND SPORT. THANK. TIFFANY VAN ON THE BRIDGE HOUSING IS PART. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY DO A LAST CALL. WHO ARE IN SUPPORT LAST CALL? ALL RIGHT BUT WE WELCOME THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO COME FORWARD. WE'RE GONNA ASK GERMAN IF YOU DON'T MIND -- AND YOU CAN COME RIGHT BACK UP AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH OPPOSITION. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR A PRIMARY A PRIMARY INDIVIDUAL. FIRST TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION THAT WILL BE FIVE MINUTES. AND WE HAVE A SECONDARY AT TWO MINUTES. SO THIS TORRENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SOCIAL XIN WE PRODUCE HAD OPPOSING WAS AMENDED POSITION BUT WE HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION AND WE'RE NOW NEUTRAL. DOES A PROVISION OF REGARDING DEMOLITION IN THE BILL. THAT WE HAD ISSUES WITH THAT SINCE BEEN RESOLVED WITH THE LAST MOMENTS AND JUST WENT THINK THE CENTER FOR OPENNESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BAILEY. WE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THIS AS FAR AS A PRIMARY WITNESS. I'M SORRY. OTHER SCREENING IS GIVES YOUR FIRST AND LAST AN ORGANIZATION OF FIVE MINUTES AND WE'LL GO TO THE CITIES. FOR GREAT THANK YOU -- SENATE GEORGIA VISITING AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. J. THE AUTHOR AND HER -- STAFF WORKING WITH US ON SOME OF THE CLEAN UP PROVISIONS AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE REALLY HELPFUL SO COMBINING SOME OF THOSE THOSE A DIFFERENT SECTIONS INTO ONE HAS BEEN. MADE MADE IT MUCH EASIER TO ACTUALLY READ -- WE DON'T HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE STRUCTURE OR THE IDEA THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME THINGS THAT JUST ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAPPEN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE APPRECIATE THAT -- AN APPLICATION OF MORATORIUM THAT MAKING THAT A LITTLE BIT CLEANER MORE UNDERSTANDABLE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE AN INCOMPLETE APPLICATION THAT THE REVISED APPLICATION YOU DON'T GET TO DO. NEW INFORMATION THAT YOU DID REQUIRE IN YOUR CHECKLIST THE FIRST TIME AROUND SO WE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE REALLY LIKE IN THE BILL -- WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A SUB OPPOSE IT LESS AMENDED HOWEVER THE BILL IS NOT CLEAR AND IT MAY BE CLEARER FOR DEVELOPERS I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THE BILL THAT ARE -- NOT. ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT WE UNDERSTAND OURSELVES HOW WE BE ABLE TO COMPLY. IT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT JURISDICTIONS ARE IN AND ARE OUT AND FOR WHAT REASON AND WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON EVERY IN DIVIDEND -- TO EVERY JURISDICTION THAT WOULD BE IN WE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH ADDING SOMETHING CALLED A COMPLETE INITIAL APPLICATION. THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT'S THERE WOULDN'T EVEN ALLOW US TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THE THE APPLICATION AND THE PROJECT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SEEK WERE. THE TIME LINES OF TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AND ONLY THREE HEARINGS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU STILL HAVE TO DO SEE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T YOU SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND THE</u> STREAMLINING ACT IN. TWELVE MONTHS. DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE AREAS HEARINGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE OF THAT. WHATEVER YOU END UP WITH IS SECURE IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A SEQUEL LAWSUIT SO. THOSE THE KIND OF THINGS WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON BUT THERE ARE SOME ON STARTERS LIKE THAT COMPLETED INITIAL APPLICATION THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY SO -- WE DO HAVE SOME THINGS THAT WE CANNOT AGREE. TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE THE CITY'S. FUTURE MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES I'M CERTAINLY CONCURRENT COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUE OVER THE PA. I'M AYE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SENATOR STAFF FOR REACHING OUT TO US AND BEING SO WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTINUE. I'M TO WORK IS THAT ALMOST SORT OF IT DOES WHICH AND COME. YOU KNOW THE ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ADMISSION FOR THERE CERTAINLY IS HOUSING CRISIS AND WE NEED TO BUILD HOMES. FASTER AND WE NEED A LOT MORE OF THEM AND WE'RE CERTAINLY COMMITTED. TO HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT I THINK WHAT YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT AND AND ONE GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS. YOU KNOW THE FREEZING OF IMPACT FEES FOR THAT DECADE -- AND OTHER FEES AND EXACTIONS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PRECLUDED FROM IMPLEMENTING BILLS THAT PASSED THIS LEGISLATURE LIKE AB FIFTY NO FIVE EXPANDED INCLUSIONARY ORDINANCES TO INCLUDE RENTAL HOUSING. THAT'S A POLICY THE STATE WANTS OUR CITIES TO ADVANCE WE WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING THAT IN THIS BILL FOR A DECADE. THE SAME GOES FOR RENT CONTROL UNDER EXISTING LAW NOW CITIES CAN IMPOSE RENT CONTROL ON THE LAWN THE FALL COSTA HAWKINS. AGAIN THIS WOULD PRECLUDE CITIES FROM TAKING THOSE ACTIONS FOR THAT DECADE SO. AND SO -- WE CERTAINLY THINK THAT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MODIFIED THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS I'M THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW OUR LOCALS ALWAYS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TO MANAGE SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE PARKING OR COMMUNITIES THIS AGAIN WOULD FREEZE OUR ABILITY TO POSE ANY OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR A DECADE. WHICH AS THE DEVELOPERS MENTIONED EARLIER -- WOULD SAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY WHICH IS AND IN FACT THE CASE BUT THE STATE ISN'T CAPTURING THAT. IF YOU USE EXISTING DESI BONUS ON NOW -- AND YOU DO GET A WAIVER FROM PARKING REQUIREMENTS WE GET AFFORDABLEUNITS OUT OF THAT. I'M THIS WOULDN'T PASS ON THAT SAVINGS OR GUARANTEE THAT ANY OF THESE UNITS WILL BE BUILT OR RENTED MORE CHEAPLY. THE COST MY GO DOWN FOR THE DEVELOPER BUT THERE'S NO ASSURANCES THAT THE RENTS WILL GO DOWN OR THE FOR SALE PRICE WILL GO DOWN. SO AGAIN WE THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THOUGH THAT IF YOU FREEZE THE OUR FEES FOR TEN YEARS COSTS WILL CONTAIN TO GO UP NO MATTER WHAT. AND THEN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO NECESSARY PROVIDE THAT SERVICE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO EITHER TAP OR GENERAL FUND IN ORDER TO FILL IN THE GAPS OVER THAT DECADE. OR WE WILL PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO DO AND WITH THAT WE WILL BE CONTENT OR FOR THE CENTER. HI MODIFY THE BILL SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COME INTO SUPPORTER OF YOUR INITIAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A GREAT BUT WE LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE COME PORTS AT YOUR FIRST AND LAST AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION WE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. WE APOLOGIZE WE GOT A LETTER IN ON MONDAY OUR POSITION IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED OUR SOLE CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THE TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON CONNECTION FEES INCAPACITY CHARGES. I DO WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF WE HAVE HAVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT ISSUE. CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GET IT RESOLVED AND IF WE DO WE HAVE NO FURTHER CONCERNS THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER ANDERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CARE ROSS ON BEHALF THE CITY SOLANO BEACH IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WOULD OCCUR THE CONCERNS OF THE LEAGUE CITIES ANOTHER THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME WE HAVE A SQUISHY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON I CAN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. S. C. MUA DID NOT TAKE A POSITION ON SB [inaudible] THREE THIRTY LARGELY. MR ACT ANDERSON FROM AQUA REFERENCE THE ISSUES WITH IMPACT FEES AND PASSED THE CHARGES. ARE STANDING IS THAT IT WAS NOT THE INTENT OF THE SENATOR. TO INCLUDE CONNECTION FEES AND TO PASS THE CHARGERS WHEN CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS ON IMPACT FEES. WE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL ONCE IT GOES JUST TO SENATE HOUSING AND HOPEFULLY THAT SNATOR REMAINS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE -- WHO MADE THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCED THIS TIME THIS CAN BE A LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION? ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR SKINNER FIRST. RESPOND -- ON ANY ITEMS OF WITNESS TESTIMONY CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU CHAIR -- WELL FIRST OF OWNERS SAY THAT I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT THE PLANNING ASSOCIATION EXPRESSED THAT THEY THERE ARE SOME THINGS THEY REALLY LIKE IN THE BILL. I'M. WE I AM -- WILLING TO TALK TO THE MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE COMPLETE INITIAL APPLICATION AND WHETHER OUR DEFINITION OF IT IS. OF FAULTY ON SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM THERE IS WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COME TO RESOLUTION BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE CAN. AND THEN THE ISSUE OF THAT DE BY LANGUAGE MAY BE CONFUSING WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO FIND. THE LANGUAGE CONFUSING I THINK ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THIS IS WE HAVE A WONDERFUL LEDGE COUNCIL HERE THAT TRAPS ARE BILL ARE BILLS. BUT SOMETIMES THERE IS DRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT IS HARD FOR THE INTERVIEWS AFFECTED TO INTERPRET SO I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT DOWN. WITH OTHER WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE THEY IN THE LEDGE COUNCIL'S DRAFT OF IT IS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] V. I.. THE ISSUES AROUND -- THAT THE WATER AGENCIES AND MUNICIPAL POWER ASSOCIATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS IN THE FEES IN GENERAL. I AM CERTAIN THAT WILL COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SWEET SPOT -- WHAT WE WERE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS I OPENED IN THE BILL IS? TO GET. THE THREE MILLION UNITS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE WERE TRYING [inaudible] TO SHE VIÃ§T. AT WITH ALSO REDUCING COST BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS AFFORDABILITY AND WE DON'T WANT. TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR MARKET RATE HOUSING TO BE ANY MORE EXPENSIVE. THAN IT SHOULD BE ANOTHER WORDS WE DON'T ADD TO THE COST OF THAT MARKET RATE WHERE WE COULD AVOID SO THAT WE CAN KEEP SOME LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY NOW CLEARLY THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE. WITH ANY JURISDICTIONS. ON DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCES OR INCLUSIONARY ORDINANCES IT DOES NOT IT RESPECT ALL OF THOSE SO IT HAS A AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT IN THAT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. BUT OF COURSE IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE MARKET RATE HOUSING BUT WE WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE IT. OUT LOWEST COST AS POSSIBLE SO THE ISSUE OF SPEED WHAT'S THE IT MAKES HOUSING EXPENSIVE BESIDE SCARCITY IT IS THE TIME IT TAKES FROM THE POINT YOU. SEVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO GET YOUR PERMIT TO THE POINT YOU GET TO BUILD IT. AND ANY COSTLY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ADDED WHETHER THAT'S PARKING OR OTHER THINGS SO BUT WE WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF COURSE LIKE ANY MEMBER. ANY AUTHOR I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE NO OPPOSITION -- WHETHER I CAN ACHIEVE THAT OR NOT DON'T KNOW BUT I WILL CERTAINLY TRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE SKINNER BUT I COULD OPEN UP FOR THE COMMITTEE WERE SERVICE CENTER WINNER AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A SHARE BEFORE WE START I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW THERE WERE THERE WERE -- SERVE. DISCUSSIONS UNTIL THE AND ON THE I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE AMENDMENTS. ARE SO IF WE COULD WALK THROUGH THE EXACT AMENDMENTS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. AND THIS BILL IS COMING THE HOUSING -- MANY. I'M INTERESTED NINE ONE VOTING ON ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO BE DOING. EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALSO RECEIVE THE AMENDMENTS LATE LAST NIGHT AS WELL EACH YEAR STAFF. AND WILL OUTLINE THE FOR IN THE LAST CENTER SKINNER TO BE ABLE TO ADD ON IF THERE ARE ANY THE NAME IS HE LIKELY TO MAKE TO MY WORDS. NUMBER ONE IN MANY GRANDFATHER IN LONG STANDING VOTER APPROVED GROWTH MANAGEMENT ORDINANCES IN PREDOMINATELY AGRICULTURAL COUNTY. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES MORE BAG PLAN. IN HALF THE COUNTY OR MORE MUST BE ANGLING. AND I CAN I UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT THAT. WHAT THAT MEANS IN THIS I MEAN THAT THOSE -- AND WHAT THOSE VOTERS OUT INITIATIVE DAR THESE. ARE THESE COMMUNITIES THAT UP DOT THE I HOUSING MORATORIUM A POPULATION COP [inaudible] HOUSING TOP [inaudible] OR BECAUSE SOME JUST YOUR I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WERE WE GIVEN PERMISSION TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON HOUSING. THESE ARE MOSTLY [inaudible] AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. TYPE OF GROWTH MANAGEMENT ORDER. MANY HAVE BEEN LOOSING SINCE THE ORIGINAL Ã³RDENES HAVE BEEN IN BACK. I IN WHERE AND I'LL LET TENER SKINNER FILLING SHE THINK THAT I'M MISREPRESENTING. I'M IT WAS. OUR BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD NARROW WHAT THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION WHAT. IT IS NOT FOCUS ON ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADMINISTRATIVELY BY COUNSEL. FOR MAINSTREAM PLAN BUT SIMPLY VOTER APPROVED. IT'S FULL FOCUS AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES. WHERE GROWTH INTO AG LANDS WOULD BE THE GREATEST THREAT? BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN AGRICULTURAL AREAS SAY WE WANT TO PRESERVE OUR OUR OUR OUR FARMLAND I DON'T PROBLEM WITH THAT. WHAT WHAT I DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THIS ONE COMMUNITIES DECIDE WE'RE GOING? TO LOCK DOWN AND NOT HAVE NEW HOUSING FOR A MORATORIUM ON HOUSING. I SOME DO IT THROUGH A POPULATION COP WHICH IS BIZARRE AND OUTRAGEOUS TO ME -- AND THEN WERE A NUMERICAL THING HAVE NO MORE THAN EXT NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS. AND SO I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SAYING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT ENCROACHING ON TO OUR PROBLEM WITH FRANK GUYS I AM OKAY WITH THAT -- AND YOU DO THAT GROUP BUILDING MORE HOUSING AND URBANIZED AREAS. BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN. PUTTING A MORATORIUM OR A OR A COP SAYING. IN IN THROUGH OUR RESEARCH. OVER THE LAST WEEK WE CAN HALF. IT WOULD BE MORE CAP ON NUMBER OF UNITS BUT NOT ON POPULATION. OKAY NUMBER OF UNITS SO FOR EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE A IT'S NOT A IN A NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT -- BECAUSE I KNOW I KNOW YEAH IT'S IT'S THERE ARE. THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OUT THERE BUT RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE LET'S SAY IF TOWN. THAT IS SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND. SO -- SO YEAH ARE THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THE TOWN HAS SAID YOU CAN INCLUDE IN THE FARM LAND. OR WE'RE GONNA SAY IN OUR URBANITE URBANIZED AREAS -- IN THE TOWN ITSELF WHICH IS NOT FORM AND WE'RE PUTTING A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS SOME MAY HAVE BOTH. SO IN THE ORIGINAL DISCUSSION -- PLEASE ENTER SKINNER TO FREE TO ADD IN IF I AM AND STAY CAN. WE WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE BILL. SO WE ACTUALLY TOOK OUT THE ISSUE OF URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES BECAUSE WE BOTH BELIEVE. THAT URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES ARE A GOOD THING. WHAT IS LEFT AND WHAT IS IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IS ON VOTER APPROVED GROWTH MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE -- THAT HAVE BEEN OF APPROVED BY THE LOCAL LOCAL ELECTRIC -- IN TO BE ABLE TO NARROW THAT DEFINITION BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE COMMITTEE WAS THAT. WE FOCUS ON THOSE AGRICULTURAL AND SMALLER CANCERS BUT THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE SOME THESE MEASURES. THE RED DOT TO GO BEYOND THE URBAN GROWTH BUT I DON'T PROBLEM WITH URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY. BUT URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES. EARTH MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS IT BEEN PROVED RIGHT WITHIN THE INTERIOR THE CITY WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE CITY IN OTHER WORDS IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO RISK PROGRAM. I'M WONDERING IF WE COULD LIMIT THAT. EXEMPTION. TO THE PROTECTION OF FARMLAND AS OPPOSED TO SAYING IN OUR CITY WORK HOPPING THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS THE BILL. HAS A AYE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO SAY THAT'S NOT OKAY. ANYMORE TO TO SAY. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE X. NUMBER OF UNITED TENDED TO LEGAL TO BUILD MORE THAN THAT. SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON THE DICE AT THIS TIME. HI THIS IS AT AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS STRUCK I THINK COMPROMISES WERE MADE ON BOTH SIDES -- AND BE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONON THIS -- BUT THIS IS THE AGREEMENT THAT IS IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND THE NAME IS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE MEMBERS. THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADVANCE WAS NO PARKING MINIMUM. IN A FOR A QUARTER MILE OF RAIL STOPS IN CITIES AND COUNTIES -- OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OR CITIES OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION IN SMALLER COUNTIES. POINT FIVE SPACES PER UNIT ELSE WHERE. I NUMBER THREE INCREASING NUMBER OF HEARINGS AND SINGLE PROJECT OFFERED A NOBLE HEARINGS FROM I YES YEP IN THE END THAT IS A CLARIFICATION LÃ  THAT WE ARE ADVANCE ON I KNOW THIS CAME FROM THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. THAT THAT TWELVE MONTH CLOCK ONLY STARTS TICKING AFTER SEEK WHAT. SO AFTER SEEKERS RATIFIED THEN THAT TWELVE MONTHS -- STARTS TICKING SO THAT THE THREE DO NOVOS GOES TO FIVE ALL WITHIN THAT SHOT CLOCK OF TWELVE AND IT WAS A IN THE RESULT IN THE VERSION BILL BEFORE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THREE THE THAT A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD START UP THE SEAT WAS WHILE. I BELIEVE SO YES SO THAT'S WHERE THE DISCUSSION NOT. BE A RAISED AROUND. THE SECRET THING WAS NOT. IT IS NOT YOUR MAIN BECAUSE RIGHT THIS WOULD BE AFTER THE OKAY SO SO GOING FROM THREE TO FIVE SO WHAT AND ALMOND PERIOD RIGHT I CAN. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT BUT I WOULD JUST I JUST FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW I'M OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND I'M NOT -- OF THE COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH THE TERM IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE ON I I STRONGLY DISAGREE. WITH ALLOWING. ANY MORATORIUM ON HOUSING. HOUSING NUMERICAL COP POPULATION POP TO BE AN IMPACT I DON'T TO ME IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A SMALL CITY. WORLD A LARGE CITY -- I AM. VERY MUCH OKAY WITH PROTECTING FARMLAND. AND HAVING GROWTH BOUNDARIES TO PROTECT FARMLAND BUT WITHIN THE URBANIZED AREAS HAVING THOSE KINDS A MORATORIUM COPS. I'M FRANKLY IS ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT IS HAS FUELED. OUR OUR OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ON THE GROSS ASIAN APENNINE I RESPECT THAT PROCESS BUT I WILL EXPRESS MY DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT. REMEMBER NO VERY GRATEFUL CENTER US AND WIENER ANY. AS A PROMISE A GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE. A FROM WHEN I JUST AT ISSUE WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED WAS AN ISSUE AROUND TIME. WE AS YOU MENTIONED WE DID COMPLETELY AGREE ON THAT WE WERE IN NO WAY TRYING -- TO ELIMINATE GROWTH BOUNDARIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN MANY AREAS THOSE WERE ENACTED TO PROTECT AGRICULTURAL LAND -- OPEN SPACE RATHER THINGS. NOW WE DID HAVE A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH AROUND CAPPING NUMBERS OF UNITS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. I'M IS TO HELP US GET THE THREE MILLION UNITS THAT WE NEED. AND SO YOU KNOW I DID HAVE SOMEONE COME TO BILL EIGHTY WITH. WITH AYE THOSE RESTRICTIONS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED THAT WE DIDN'T END UP INCLUDING. THAT WE MAY WANT TO REVISIT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T ANY CAP ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME UNITS. SO IN A YEAH WE MAY WANT. TO REVISE THE AFFORDABILITY FACTOR YEAH I THINK YEAH SOMETHING. IN ONE OF THE ITEMS I WANT BUT WORDS INTO CENTER SKINNER'S MOUTH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANY ISSUE IN REGARDS TO AYE AE CAPTAIN AFFORDABLE. NO WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES THAT WOULD BE RENO WHEN AT THE MODERATE LOW THERE MAY BE SOME AND YOU KNOW WE'D HAVE TO GET GRANULAR BUT THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME ABILITY. TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND WORK IF WE WERE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE WERE SOME THAT THROUGH THIS AMENDMENT. WE WERE INCLUDING. SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE. A MEASURE THAT CAPPED LOW INCOME UNITS WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AGAIN AND WE DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK IN DETAIL. NO I M. FIRM BELIEF IN REGARDS THE WONDER PERCENT AFFORDABLE. I HOULD NOT BE AS WE DISCUSS RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE CAP SO HAPPY BETTER CONTINUE THAT. WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US THOUGH TODAY ARE THE AMENDMENTS I THAT HAVE BEEN? HAMMERED OUT IN VERY GRATEFUL -- TO SENATOR SKINNER AND HER TEAM I INTO THE GOVERNOR FIGHT TEAM HERE'S WELL. I THINK THAT -- AFTER ANY NEGOTIATION I THINK I EACH SIDE WALKS AWAY. WITH COMPROMISES. AND KNOW THAT EACH SIDE WALKED AWAY IN THIS NEGOTIATION WITH COMPROMISES THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WHICH WERE VERY GRATEFUL. FOR I WOULD LIKE TO BE RETURNED OVER THE VICE CHAIR -- AND THEN ALSO TO SENATOR ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MISSED THIS THE OPENING PRESENTATION. AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE IN THE MATERIAL BUT ARE THERE ANY EXEMPTIONS FOR ANY CITIES OR COUNTY. ON THE THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. IT'S FOR TEN YEARS ONLY. AND IT BASICALLY RECOGNIZES IT TELLS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WHICH ALREADY DOING. BUT DO IT FASTER AND SO THE ONLY THING IT LIFTS IN THE TEN YEAR PERIOD. IS. THAT IT IT. PUT IT RESTRICTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM ENACTING. A MORATORIUM ON HOUSING OR ENACTING A CAP ON HOUSING UNITS OR DOWN ZONING DURING THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD SFI ANY PARTICULAR CITIES YEAH BUT WHAT IT DOES IS. IT APPLIES BASED ON HARD CRITERIA [inaudible] FOR VACANCY. AND HI RENTS SO THERE ARE RURAL AREAS IN THE STATE THAT DON'T GET INCLUDED. AND AND I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO SEND TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE LA -- DEVELOPED A TOOL FOR US WHERE. THE THE HIDE CRITERIA THAT WE INCLUDED IN THE BILL THE LA -- STEEP TOOL ALLOWS YOU TO SEE EXACTLY WHICH RURAL AREAS IN THE STATE THEN AREN'T COVERED. AND THE REASON IS THAT. THIS THOSE AREAS ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THE HOUSING PRICES THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCING HIGH HIGH COSTS THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCING. REALLY A LOW VACANCY RATES SO. THIS IS NOT A NECESSITY TO ASK THEM TO DO EVERYTHING FASTER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THIS. IS THAT GETTING THOSE THREE MILLION UNITS OF HOUSING WE NEED IN THOSE NEXT TEN YEARS. AS AS MUCH AS IN REFLECTING WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY AGREED. THAT TO WHAT THEY WANT IT'S JUST LET'S DO IT A LITTLE FASTER AND DON'T CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM. SO SCRATCHES WERE AGES YEAH SO. CITIES CERTAIN COUNTIES LIKE MARIN ARE NOT EXCLUDED THEIR THE SAME AS ANY OTHER [inaudible] COUNTY. YES MARIN SAID OR HUNTINGTON BEACH. EXACTLY. WHAT I MENTIONED MARIN THEY HAVE? NO WELL THEY WERE EXEMPTED UNDER A DIFFERENT. THIS. THE BUDGET ACT BUT THAT IS NOT. THAT. ANY CITY IN MARIN UNDER THIS MEASURE. BECAUSE IT IS NOT A PREDOMINATELY AGRICULTURAL COUNTY. AND PLUS THE PRE DONNELLY AGRICULTURAL COUNTY ONLY DEALS WITH GROWTH -- RESTRICTIONS ANYWAY BUT ANY CITY IN MARIN COUNTY. AND THEY'VE ALL GOT THEIR OWN ZONING RULES. AND I I DON'T WANT TO SAY EVERY BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE ZONE SOME PORTIONS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR HOUSING. RIGHT TO DESERVE A SEAT BUT BUT THEY ALL EVERYBODY HAS SOME PARTS OF ZONING OF HOUSING AND THEIR NOT YET. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THEIR THEIR ZONING YOU COULD PROBABLY FIND AREAS WHERE IT'S NOT YET. COME A COMPLETELY BUILT OUT IN OTHER WORDS A DAY. AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS SAYS. UNDER EXISTING ZONING LAWS. IF I COME IN APPLY. TO BUILD ONE HOUSE AN APARTMENT THREE HOUSES AND IF THAT YOUR RULES. THEN YOU'VE AN AYE YOU TELL ME WHAT NEEDS TO BE IN MY APPLICATION I SUBMIT MY APPLICATION. AND IT'S COMPLETE THEN YOU GOT TO GIVE ME THE PERMIT IN ONE YEAR. YOU GOT A PROCESS MY PERMITTING YEAR WHATEVER AMOUNT HEARINGS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU GOT TO HAVE IN THAT YEAR. AND SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT HOUSING THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY GRATEFUL. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PLEASE I ACTUALLY -- FOR AYE AND QUESTIONS PER -- FOR A BA IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. WHEN THEY WERE UP HERE I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT THE FLOW -- pMIND I EACH OF YOU RE INTRODUCING YOURSELVES. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR BOTH A PA AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES CAUSED UNCLEAR TO MELIKE YOU'RE. YOU'RE POSING THE BELL BUT THEN YOU REYES SORT OF SOME -- REALLY TECHNICAL -- OBJECTIONS TO IT BUT YOU KNOW THE HEART OF THIS BILL IS -- FIRST OF ALL THE YOU KNOW WAS CLARIFIED THAT IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH A CAMERA BUT THIS IS THE TWELVE MONTHS AFTER SHE WAS DONE SO THAT IT SEEMS LIKE AN INVALID. OUR CRITIQUE OF THE BELL -- SOME GLAD THE RECORD GOT CORRECTED ON THAT THIS WHOLE NOTION -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DO THAT IT IS POSSIBLE [inaudible] I'M. BUT I THE THE HEART OF THE BILL IS REALLY SAYING [inaudible] YOU CAN. THERE ARE THESE TOOLS THAT FRANKLY WEALTHY COMMUNITIES HAVE USED FOR MANY YEARS TO KEEP FIVE ONE CALL IT HOURS OR WEALTHY COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE CREATED OVERWHELMINGLY WEALTHY COMMUNITIES THANK THIS IS OUR WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT -- HAVE NO CHANGE IN OUR COMMUNITY IMPRISONED AMBER THEY WERE GONNA PUT A MORATORIUM ON HOUSING. WE'RE GOING TO PUT A POPULATION COPPER GROWTH COP OR GOING TO DOWN ZONE. AND SAY WE'RE GONNA NOW BANNED APARTMENT BUILDING. AND WHEN THE STATE HASN'T RESIST HISTORY OF USING THESE TOOLS TO MY QUESTIONS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. AN API IN TERMS OF THIS BILLS TEN YEAR. PROHIBITION ON DOWN ZONING ON POPULATION COPS ON GROWTH COPS ON HOUSING MORATORIUM. DO YOU THE DO A PA AND LEGAL CITIES [inaudible] SUPPORT. DOT PORTION OF THE BILL. THURMOND COMMENTS OFF. HEY I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT MY PHONE IS ON WE'RE GOOD. I'M WE DO SUPPORT THE CLARIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION FOR THESE GROWTH ORDINANCES WE DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS GET THE LIMIT HOUSING UNITS. IN THEIR JURISDICTION SO -- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION ON THE SEQUEL IF I WAS WRONG I APOLOGIZE BUT THE WAY WE READ IT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE STATEMENTS IN THERE. IT WASN'T CLEAR SO THAT IT'S NOW CLEAR. THANKFUL FOR THAT. AND THE OTHER SEPARATED SO THE ON SONY DOWN. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THEM SO AFTER THE BILLS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT WE DO NOT SUPPORT DOWN SONY AND LESS IT'S TO REARRANGE THINGS AND YOU HAVE THE SAME KNOWN AT LOS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION SO IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE HERE. NO MATTER WHETHER THE HEALTHY AND WE'RE NOT WE SUPPORT REQUIRING THAT YOU OF PLACE ELSE YOU DON'T LOSE OUT. OKAY TO THE BAD THE BAN ON POPULATION COP. COP MORE THROUGHOUT YOUR KIDS OR TIME LESS IT'S IT'S BECAUSE OF A FIRE RELATED ISSUE OR UNLESS YOU HAVE NO WATER THOSE TWO THINGS THAT WERE TURNED ABOUT SO. AT ME A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM UNTIL THOSE THINGS THANK YOU IN LATER TODAY IT IS RIGHTLY CALIFORNIA CITIES WE SERVE OCCUR I MEAN IN MY JUST MY ONLY TALKED THINGS WE DIDN'T LIKE -- BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE WE WE AGREE WITH AND JUST TO ADD A LITTLE MORE THE DOWNS I MEAN I MEAN. DOWNTURN IN ITSELF IN. CENTERS CAN HAVE THE ONE SIXTY SEVEN LAST YEAR THE DOUGH AND KNOWN AS LOSS OR MEANS YOU'RE BEFORE. YEAH NO NET LOSS. RIGHT RIGHT. THE QUESTION IS DOES THE LEAGUE OF CITIES SUPPORT THE PROHIBITION ON DOWN ZONING HOUSING MORATORIUM POPULATION. GROWTH. WE DON'T HAVE EXISTING POLICY TO SUPPORT THAT BUT WE CERTAINLY DO NOT OBJECT TO THE LEGISLATURE WANTING TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS. OKAY SO IT IF THAT IT'S NOT ALL BILL BUT ABOUT WHERE THE VALUE TO THOSE -- YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY CERTAINLY YES WOULD NOT BE HERE CORRECT OKAY. WHAT ONE THING THAT I ALL AND THANK GOOD INTELLIGENCE I MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I DO WANNA -- SPECIFICALLY WITH A P. A. B.. ABOUT. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BILLS -- I WOULD I WOULD TEST I WAS ONE OF MY JUST MY OWN OPINION -- I I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES A PA HAS TECHNICAL OR WHAT. ALL OUR IMPLEMENTATION. CONCERNS ABOUT A BILL AND THAT OPPOSES THE BILL AND AND AND TRULY TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE THE EASIEST ONES. TO DOES WORK BROUGH. AND I KNOW THERE BILLS NOT JUST MY OWN BUT OTHERS THAT IT IS. COMPOSED AT EVERY PLANNER THAT I'VE EVER MET SUPPORT. AND SO I FEEL LIKE A PA AT TIMES TO JUMP TO IMPOSE POSITION CURRICULA THAT MY OPINION AND MY OPINION ONLY.

TO COMMITTEE. THIS IS SENATOR WHEN YOU ARE READY THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOU IN THIS OP WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US ON THIS BILL AND WE ARE -- IT WILL BE ACCEPTING OF THE CAN OF THE FOLLOWING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- RELATING TO THE NEW STREAMLINED PROCESS. FOR HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIERS SHELTERS SPECIFICALLY A REQUIREMENT IS THAT STAFF BE ON SITE DURING THE OPERATING HOURS. OF THE FACILITY I TO ADD IN A SEVEN YEAR SUNSET. TO THE BILL. AND TO ALLOW THIS NEW VERSION OF STREAMLINING I IN -- MIXED YOUR MIXED USE ZONES OF YES. TO THAT THAT'S THANK YOU SO MUCH THE GOOD SENATOR I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DEFINE THE PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS LATINOS MEANT THAT WAS MINE THE NEXT YEAR ALL RIGHT. WORKING ON THE PRIVACY DEFINITION. US TO THOSE OF THE I MEMBERS ARE ACCEPTING IN THE CONTINUE WORK ON A DEFINITION OF PRIVACY AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK -- WITH US ON THE BILL. SB FORTY EIGHT CREATES A NEW US STREAMLINING PROGRAM FOR INTERIM SHELTER DEVELOPMENTS ALSO KNOWN AS NAVIGATION CENTERS. OF THE GOAL OF WHICH IS TO EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL OF HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIER SHELTERS. TO CONNECT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY TO PERMANENT HOUSING ONLY A NAVIGATION CENTERS THAT MEET ALL APPLICABLE HEALTH SAFETY AND BUILDING CODES. ALLOW FOR THE PRESENCE OF PARTNERS PATHS IN THE STORAGE OF POSSESSIONS PROVIDE PRIVACY OUR LOW BARRIER -- AN OFFER SERVICES TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS NEW FORM OF STREAMLINING. THE BILL ALSO MAKES TERRIFYING CHANGES TO EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW WITH REGARDS TO ZONING. FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS ARE WHICH HAS LONG BEEN THE LAW REQUIREMENT THE CITY'S. IDENTIFY THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT A ZONE. TO PERMIT -- EMERGENCY SHELTERS ARE WITHOUT CONDITIONAL USE OR DISCRETIONARY PERMIT. WITH ON SOME CITIES HAVE -- IDENTIFIED THOSE ZONES IN AREAS WERE KNOWN WHATEVER PUT. A SHELTER FOR EXAMPLE IN A DISTANT INDUSTRIAL AREA. AND SO WE WILL BE MODIFYING -- THAT ELEMENT OF HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. I'D HAVE TO IDENTIFY EITHER RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE ZONE. AND INDUSTRIAL ZONE WILL BE ALLOWED ONLY IF IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH THAT IT'S CONNECTED TO SERVICES -- AND ACTUALLY USABLE SHELTER TO BE THERE -- WE HAVE NEW. HAS JUST COME OUT SHOWING THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD KNOWN CALIFORNIA HAS BY FAR THE LARGEST -- ON SHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE US. BUT WE LEARNED RECENTLY FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN THE BAY AREA. TWO THIRDS OF 67% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE ON SHELTERED AND LOS ANGELES 75% BROWN'S SHELTERED. BY COMPARISON NEW YORK CITY IS SEATTLE WHICH HAS A A REAL PROBLEM ON HIS HANDS IS OFF FORTY SEVEN OR 48% SO. IN OUR MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS BUT REALLY STATEWIDE WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY ON SHELTERED INDIVIDUALS -- THERE ARE ENTIRE COUNTIES IN BIG STRETCHES OF CALIFORNIA WITH NO SHELTER BEDS THE MINIMUS. OR SHELTERS ARE ONLY OPEN IN THE WINTER. I AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE IT EASIER -- TO INCREASE OUR SHELTER AND NAVIGATION CENTER CAPACITY -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY. I IS. ON THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND A WINNER AND SALAS FLOORS YOURS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANKS FOR YOUR WORK. GOOD AFTERNOON. ANYA LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AS A CENTER NOTED FOR OVER A DECADE STATE LAW HAS REQUIRED EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE STATE TO HAVE AT LEAST A ZONE. WHERE AN EMERGENCY SHELTER CAN OPERATE AS HE'S BY RIGHT -- WE'RE NOW AT A POINT OF ABOUT THE LETTER OF THE LAW BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG SLOG TO GET THERE AND AS HE NOTED ALL IN A LOT OF CASES THES BY RIGHT SOUNDS ARE IN FAR FLUNG INDUSTRIAL AREAS -- AND THEY STILL FACE A LOT OF BARRIERS TO ACTUALLY CITING THE SHELTERS -- SO ANDAND AND THAT WERE REALLY BY SIMPLY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS THE NAME A ZONE DOES NOT REALLY ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHELTERS THAT THE SCALE THAT WE NEED THEM IN MANY PLACES IN THE STATE I'M. SO WELL THE SOLUTION HOMELESSNESS. IS ACTUALLY AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF HOUSING OF ALONE VERY LOW INCOME FOLKS IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE. US SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT LIVING ON THE STREETS AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS THAT ARE UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION WHILE THEY RECEIVE NEEDED SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN SECURING PERMANENT PART OF HOUSING. SB FORTY EIGHT WILL EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIER SHELTERS AND TEMPORARY HOUSING SITUATIONS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE MORE SHELTER RATHER DESPERATELY NEEDED. WE NEED FRANKLY TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MORE TOOLS TO GET BEYOND THE REACTIONARY TYPE OF OPPOSITION PROVIDING SHELTER THAT ARE MOST BUT BROWN ON BOTH MANY MEMBERS NEED. AND THIS BILL WOULD DELIVER THAT NIGHT OR DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SOLAR. GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR CONTINUED WORK OVER THESE PAST MANY YEARS WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE.

UP TO THE DEADLINE TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT HE WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIRST DAY -- WE'VE EXTENDED THAT SAME OPTION NOW THE TWO THE LOCAL INITIATIVES LAST YEAR WITH SB. ELEVEN FIFTY THREE BUT ELEVEN FIFTY THREE DIDN'T INCLUDE REFERENDA. SO THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR TO ALLOW THE OPTION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE BALLOT INITIATIVES REMOVED -- TO ALSO INCLUDE REFERENDA CHALLENGING EXISTING LAW -- SO PRETTY SIMPLE MEASURE WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR GOVERNMENTS AT WHATEVER LEVEL LOCAL OR STATE TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE WE RECOGNIZE WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF GAME PLAYING THAT DOES GO ON AROUND THE BALLOT PROCESS AND WE DO GET LEVERAGED. I STILL THINK THOUGH THAT GIVING US THE TOOL TO INTERVENE AND TO COME UP WITH LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS AND ALLOW THAT OPTION AUDI WILL HOPEFULLY AVOID.

ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS A VICE CHAIR OF THE FOR SURE SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I GUESS IF I WERE TO GO BACK -- TO THE MOVIE -- THE GRADUATED SINCE THE WORD IS PLASTICS THAT'S THE FUTURE OF PLASTIC THIS SORT OF THIS IS SORT OF A THE FUTURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO. I APPRECIATEYOUR ASSISTANCE IN THE COMMITTEES ASSISTANCE ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I X. B. R. L.. IN LINE. XBRL WHICH IS AN OPEN STANDARD THAT ENABLES A SINGLE DOCUMENT TO PROVIDE BOTH HUMAN READABLE AND STRUCTURED MACHINE READABLE DATA. IT'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS TO THE MODERN ACCOUNTING PROCESS. IT'S OPEN TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO APPLY COMPUTER READABLE TAGS AND CODING TO BUSINESS DATA IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD DEVELOPED BY THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION XBRL INTERNATIONAL INC -- AND IT IS A WORLDWIDE STANDARD IT HAS BEEN USED IN BRITAIN FOR BUSINESS INCOME TAX AND FINANCE REPORTING SINCE APRIL. TWENTY ELEVEN THE MAIN BENEFIT IS THAT THE FORMAT IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESSING OF COMPLEX ACCOUNTING INFORMATION. ALLOWING FOR EASY AND STRESS FREE ONLINE SUBMISSION. CONVERSION SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE AND ALLOWS FOR EASY IMPORTING FROM ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS. MIGRATING CALIFORNIA'S MUNICIPALITIES TO I. X. B. R. L. IS THE GOAL. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THIS INITIATIVE DETERMINE ITS FEASIBILITY AND COST AND PROVIDE A WORKABLE IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE. I EXPERIMENTS ARE READY UTILIZED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR ITS SIX THOUSAND PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATE CORPORATE. QUARTERLY FILING REQUIREMENTS AND BY THE FDIC IS EIGHT THOUSAND QUARTERLY REPORTERS. XBRL CONVERSION IS SIMILAR TO THE EVOLUTION OF FILM TO DIGITAL CAMERAS. IT WILL REPLACE OLDER PAPER BASED PDF REPORTS WITH MORE USEFUL MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE ACCURATE DIGITAL VERSIONS. COLLEAGUES I XBRL IS BEING UTILIZED AROUND THE GLOBE AND IS THE FUTURE FOR MUNICIPAL REPORTING. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT STARTS THE DIFFICULT JOURNEY OF CHANGE WHICH IS THE BIG. DILEMMA HERE IS LIKE THIS IS A CHANGE. TO A FORMAT THAT WILL SAVE TIME AND COST WITH MANY SAYING. WHY DON'T WE DO THIS SOONER? I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I ON SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES NO I'M I'M VERY GRATEFUL AND I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN MR BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE MINUTES CORRECT. ACT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IN AGAIN IT'S MORE LIKE YOU COMING FROM THE POSITION THEY DID PRIOR TO BEING IN THE SENATE -- AND FOR ALL THE WORK HE DID. THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT ARE WORKING ON EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE INTERNAL SYSTEM I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTENSE FOCUS ON THAT. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ON SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FIRST LASSEN ORGANIZATION IN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. ARE GOOD MORNING CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WIRE. AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ABOUT SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT MY NAME IS MARK JOFFE AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST THE REASON FOUNDATION. BEFORE BECOMING A POLICY ANALYST I HOW THE RIGHT A MANAGER ROLES IN THE FEEL THE CREDIT RISK INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO INVESTMENT BANKS AND MOODY'S ANALYTICS. SIX YEARS AGO THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE COMMISSIONED MYSELF IN A CO AUTHOR TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF CREATING A QUANTITATIVE MODEL PROCESSING CALIFORNIA CITY CREDIT RISK. WE WERE HIRED IN THE AFTERMATH OF A STRING OF CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY ISN'T BONTA FAULTS BY CITIES SUCH AS STOCKTON SAN BERNADINO. ONE GOAL OF THIS INVESTIGATION WITH THE TERM AND WHETHER THE STATE COULD CREATE AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL DISTRESS. OUR CLIENTS THE CITY ARE GASES TO CONSIDER USING THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S CITY'S ANNUAL. REPORT DATA FOR THIS PURPOSE WHEN I REVIEW THE DATE I FOUND LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH WHAT IT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE CITY'S. THESE FINANCE REPORTS KNOWN AS CAPPERS ARE PREPARED TO SATISFY MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND FEDERAL SINGLE-AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ARE PUBLISHED EXCLUSIVELY IN PDF FORMAT. SO RATHER THAN USE THE CITY'S ANNUAL REPORT DATA WE UNDERTOOK THE DOT THE DAUNTING TASK. OF LOCATING KAFIRS IN HAND ENTERING THEIR DATA INTO A SPREADSHEET. IT WAS THEN THAT I REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REFORM PROPOSED IN SB. FIVE NINETY EIGHT IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO AUTOMATICALLY LOW DATA FROM KAFIRS INTO FINANCIAL MODELS WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL HEALTH. THE SORT OF MY THIS SORT OF MONITORING IS USEFUL FOR MUNICIPAL BOND ANALYSIS AS WELL STATE OVERSIGHT. IN THE ABSENCE OF TIMELY HIGH QUALITY FINANCIAL DATA. MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTORS ARE COMPELLED TO RELY AND CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND OR THEIR OWN BIASES WHEN ASSESSING CREDIT RISK. ACADEMIC RESEARCH FINDS A RATING AGENCIES ARE HARSHER AN ANALYSIS OF MUSICAL CREDIT. THEN OF CORPORATE OR ASSET BACKED CREDIT. MEANWHILE THE TRICKLE OF HIGH PROFILE MEUSEL BANKRUPTCIES SUCH AS THOSE IN DETROIT IMPORTER RICO. REINFORCED LARGELY UNFOUNDED FEARS THAT MOST MUNICIPALITIES ARE NOT CREDIT WORTHY POTENTIALLY RAISING THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR CRUCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. SO THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HARD ACCURATE NUMBERS. INVESTORS AND CORPORATE SECURITIES HAVE NEARLY REAL TIME ACCESS TO ENSURE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA. BECAUSE THE FCC HAS MANDATED THAT ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS BE DELIVERED IN MACHINE READABLE FORM. NO ONE IN THE CORPORATE SECURITIES MARKET IS HAND ENTERING BALANCE SHEET INCOME STATEMENT DATA FROM PD OPS. NOR SOULD ANYONE IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET. RETURNING TO THE ISSUE OF STATE OVERSIGHT MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE OUR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN PROJECT BUT THE CORE PROBLEM REMAINS. AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THE CITY'S ANNUAL REPORT HAS REPLACED BY THE VERY MODERN BY THE NUMBERS WEBSITE. STATE LAW WAS ALSO MODIFIED TO GIVE CITIES WERE TRYING TO ENTER THEIR FINANCIAL DATA THE COMPLETED CALPERS COULD BE CONSULTED DURING THE SCO SUBMISSION PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN BY THE NUMBERS AND CAFFERTY REMAIN FURTHER BY THE NUMBERS IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON A DELAYED BASIS. STATE LAW REQUIRES SCO TO PUBLISH THE DATA SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. BUT MANY GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN JUST SIX MONTHS OF HE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT OFFERS A MODERN SOLUTION TO THE CHALLENGE OF MONITORING LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH IF THEY'RE NOT ONLY CITIES COUNTIES. BUT VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF SPECIAL PURPOSE GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS WELL TO ALLOW THE STATE ORDERED OUR OTHER STATE AGENCIES POLICY RESEARCHERS AND CONCERNED CITIZENS MORE QUICKLY IDENTIFY RISK GOVERNMENTS. PERMITTING INTERVENTIONS IN MY PREVENT THE LOSS OF VITAL COMMUNITY SERVICES THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. CAN YOU MANY OF TWO MINUTES IF YOU SENATORS YOURSELF AN ORGANIZATION WE APPRECIATE BEING COMMITTED TODAY THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US ALL DAY. ABSOLUTELY -- THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE -- I'M MICHELLE SAVAGE I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT STANDARDS ORGANIZATION CALLED X. B. R. L. U. S. WHICH STANDS FOR EXTENSIBLE BUSINESS REPORTING LANGUAGE -- WE HAVE BUILT IN SUPPORT OPEN DATA STANDARDS AND WE BUILD STANDARDS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION WE BUILD STANDARDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FOR SOLAR FINANCING. AND WE'REWORKING ON ON OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT ACCURATE TIMELY AUTOMATED UNAMBIGUOUS STATE IT IS NECESSARY NECESSARY FOR GOVERNMENTS CITY POLICY. FOR SECURITIES ANALYST MAKING INVESTMENTS. EVER CITIZENS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. AND THE ONE METHOD IT TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH QUALITY TIME WE DID IT IS STANDARDS. DATA STANDARDS ARE A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THEY REDUCE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS COSTS THE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR REPORTING ENTITIES. AND THEY LET GOVERNMENTS RESPOND RAPIDLY TO CHANGE. WE SUPPORT SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE WILL HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH A BETTER DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS INFRASTRUCTURE. AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE LONG TERM. WELL THE BENEFITS THE STANDARDIZATION OUTWEIGH THE COSTS WE KNOW THE COST IS A CONCERN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF AN EXTRA REAL TAXONOMY WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A DIGITAL DICTIONARY OF TERMS. THIS TAXONOMY CAN GROW AND CHANGE OVER TIME BUT THE CREATION OF THE TAXONOMY IS A ONE TIME COST IT'S AN INVESTMENT. SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TAXONOMY CAN BE HANDLED BY BUSINESS MANAGERS WITHIN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SIGNIFICAN I. T. INVOLVEMENT. AND A VOLUNTEER ACTUALLY WAS WORKING GROUP HAS ALREADY BEEN HARD AT WORK DEVELOPING A SET OF DATA STANDARDS REPRESENT THE CAP FOR THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTRIBUTE THIS TO THE TO THE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ACTUAL STANDARD IS NAMED IN SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE IT HAS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PURPOSE. FIRST IS WIDELY USED I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE SENATOR -- ADDRESS THAT. AS USED BY HUNDRED REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD SIX IN SIXTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OVER TEN MILLION COMPANIES USE THE EXTERNAL STANDARD ME THIRTY SECONDS -- IS A FREE OPEN STANDARD THERE NO LICENSING -- COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT IT IS SOFTWARE AGNOSTIC IT IS NOT SOFTWARE IS SIMPLY A STAND THAT WORKS WITH MANY DIFFERENT TEXAS OFFERS EVEN ONES THAT THAT -- PUBLIC AGENCIES WORKING WITH TODAY. IT'S DESIGNED TO WORK WITH FINANCIAL DATA IT HANDLES THE COMPLEXITIES OF FINANCIAL DATA. AND IT ADAPTS TO CHANGE IT CHANGES WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE CHANGES WITH TECHNOLOGY IT DOESN'T LEAVE US IN A STAGNANT SITUATION. GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE ADOPT STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY WORK. THE SEC IS A NEW RULINGS EVERY WEEK BRINGING IN NEW TYPES OF REPORTING ENTITIES USE EXPIRY ALL. THE FBI STE THE FDIC PROGRAM THAT WAS MENTIONED THAT BANKS ARE USING HAS RESULTED IN TREMENDOUS EFFICIENCIES FOR THE BANKING SYSTEM. AND FINALLY THERE WAS A PROGRAM IN AUSTRALIA THAT REQUIRES A IS DATA STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS IS HEREBY FORMAT. AND THAT PROGRAM IS RESULTING ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS EVERY YEAR. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT I THINK IT'S A WIN FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND MAKING IT OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO ALL IS WELL WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT. AND I REALLY MEAN IS THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AT NO THEY BOTH YOU'RE BUSY WE APOLOGIZE THAT IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. FUND.

CENTER MORE LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IN SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT NOW WE HAVE A BELIEF BLOCKCHAIN TO SENATOR HERTZBERG. ALL RIGHT HEY THERE YOU GO. BUT THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR CONVERSION MANY YEARS AGO WAS CALLED EDGAR. AND SO YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITIES OF AVAILABLE OR HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITH WITH TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR INFORMATION. IT'S A IT'S LIKE A TAG IT'S IT'S A SEARCH CAPABILITIES SO IF YOU WANTED TO START DOING SOME RESEARCH. IN YUTH IS OUR KING AND KEY WORDS AND BOOM THOSE THOSE THOSE NUMBERS WILL COME UP FOR YOU AS OPPOSED TO FLIPPING THROUGH PAGE BY PAGE ON A PDF ON YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN. WHAT'S ALSO NICE IS THAT YOU ENTER THE DATA NCE AND THEN THAT DATA CAN PROPAGATE ALL OTHER FORMS. SO THAT'S WHY THE COUNTRY OF AUSTRALIA IS RECEIVING A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OF FISH AND SEE IN THIS OPPORTUNITY. I WANT TO THANK THE STATE TREASURER BEYOND. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUNG AMMASH GIVES ME. STILL FIGHTING SOME ALLERGY OR SO GOOD -- AND SHE HAS -- TO MY GOOD FRIEND TIM SCHAFER ON ON ON STAFF AND HE'S BEEN A REAL -- ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS WELL AND THAT'S WHY WE WENT THERE WE HAVE A TREASURE UNDER COMMITTEE.

I THINK JUST A ROLL CALL PLEASE REQUIRE HIGH WHY I'M MORE LOCK MORE LIKE AYE BELL HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG RICARDO. HELLO I NIELSEN. WIENER WIENER HIGH. FIVE FIVE EIGHT ZERO THIS BILL IS STILL ON HOLDEN KEEP THIS OPEN AND ADD IT MEMBERS ON AT THE PERFECT TIME. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A QUICK BREAK FOR TWO MINUTES -- QUICK RECESS FOR TWO MINUTES AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU JIM WE WELCOME YOU BACK. AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP SAYING IT TO THE VERY AND WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU OF FOR THE PATIENTS OF ALL OF YOU BEEN HANGING WITH US ALL DAY -- WE ARE NOW GOING TO BE PRESENTING. ITEM NMBER ELEVEN AS BEFORE. THIRTY EIGHT WE'RE GONNA ASK -- SERGEANTS OR IS IT THANK YOU SERGEANTS FOR THE FANTASTIC WORK TODAY'S WELL IF WE CAN GET. CENTER ABOUT -- OVER THE COMMITTEES WE WILL HAVE ONE BILL LEFT NUMBER NEED TO BE AN ADD ON THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SP FOUR THIRTY EIGHT CENTER HERTZBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH -- TO TO YOUR TEAM FOR ALL OF THE WORK ON THIS BILL. PLEASE SIR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS APOLOGIZE THAT WAS EARLIER TODAY IN THE COMMITTEE A LOT OF CRAZIES ONE OF THOSE DAYS A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON SO. I'M SO SORRY FOR THAT AND NOT LISTENING TO THE OTHER BILLS THE THE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION AMONG THE SPONSOR AND SHERMAN WITH RESPECT -- TO AGREED UPON -- AMENDMENT -- WHICH WE CAN READ INTO THE RECORD. OF IT BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING HERE YOU KNOW IS IS DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE -- ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND THE MEAL MY OPENING POINT I THINK IT MAKES THE THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY ON THIS MEASURE IS AN ERROR MADE OF CAUTION. IT'S MUCH LESS COSTLY THAN AIR MADE BECAUSE OF PRICE -- WE HAVE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS FOR E. R. WHERE LIVES ARE LOST IN A MATTER OF SECONDS AND GOVERNMENT PROVIDES -- CONSTRUCTS AROUND STAFFING AND RESPONSE TIME FOR MEDICAL SERVICES IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS TO PROTECT LIVES. CURRENTLY SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN DELEGATE THE LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES DISPATCHER THIRTY TO PRIVATE ENTITIES OFTEN WITH DIRE CONSEQUENCES -- WE'VE LEARNED IN MY WITNESSES WHAT'S IT WILL SHARE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT THAT THAT A PUBLIC ENTITY BUT WHETHER THAT BE A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYER A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS THAT IS BEST SUITED. TO THE ONE IN CHARGE OF DECIDING WHO OR WHAT AND SKI IS SET TO AN EMERGENCY SEE. SO IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PERSON ARRIVES ON THE SCENE OF AN EMERGENCY WILL DO THEIR BEST. JOB OF THEY POSSIBLY CAN THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT PERSON EVER GETS A CALL TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE IN A TIMELY MANNER SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WITH RESPECT TO RESPONSE TIMES IS REALLY CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS ONLY CONTRACTED OUT WHEN IS CONTRACTED OUT THROUGH FIRE OFFICIALS THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT LARGER DYNAMIC IN WITH THAT. DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST OR IS SHE FOR THE FIRST. OKAY. CHIEF WE LOOKING BACK TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR ALL YOUR WORK SIR AND AGAIN WANT TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE DELAY YOU'VE BEEN WITH US FOR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IS. FOR SO -- THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU'VE TO MINISTRY. THE CHAIR HAND OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS MIKE MCLAUGHLIN I'M THE FIRE CHIEF OF HIS IN THIS FIRE DEPARTMENT IN ELK GROVE AND I'M HERE TODAY'S OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION -- AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS BILL YOU YOU MAY HEAR ARGUMENTS THIS IS ABOUT MEDICAL CONTROL. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MEDICAL CONTROL OUR PARAMEDICS ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY MEET THE TRAINING MANDATES AND STANDARDS IDENTIFIED BY THE COUNTIES IN THE LOCAL LANCES. AND WE FOLLOW ALL OF ESTABLISH LOCAL PROTOCOLS PUT IN PLACE BY THE OLYMPUS. AS BEFORE THIRTY EIGHT IS ABOUT THE HOME RULE LOCAL CONTROL AND ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY -- IT'S FALLS IN THE LINES THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE WITHIN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. I'M HERE TODAY AS A MAJOR REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BIG SMALL RULE VOLUNTEER CAREER COMBINATION ORGANIZATIONS. THERE'S MANY MODELS OUT THERE IN TERMS OF HOW. WE WORK TOGETHER MOST OF WHICH ARE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND THEY WORK VERY VERY WELL. THE DYNAMIC WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID WHEN THE LAMPS CONTRACT OUT DISPATCH SERVICES AND DICTATE WHICH CALLS LOCAL AGENCIES CAN AND CANNOT RESPOND TO IS REALLY THE CORE OF THE MATTER THAT WE'RE BRINGING BEFORE YOU TODAY FOR CONSIDERATION. AN EXAMPLE THAT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN FOR THE SAKE OF A MOTION IDEA MESSES LET ME MOVE AWAY FROM ME A MESS AND LET'S USE LAW ENFORCEMENT AS AN EXAMPLE. A CRIME IS COMMITTED IN ONE OF YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY A RESIDENT CZ EMERGENCY CALLS. TRANSFERRED TO A PRIVATE SECURITY DISPATCH CENTER. AND BECAUSE OF DIRECTION BEING GIVEN FROM A MIDDLE MANAGER WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT EVEN DISPATCHER NOTIFIED OF EMERGENCY WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. AND PRIVATE RESOURCES ARE DISPATCHED INSTEAD OF IT. THIS SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS IN IN NATURE BECAUSE IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES YET IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY WHEN IT RELATES TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN RENDERING CARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- TO MOVE MOVE THIS CASE FORWARD AND TO BRING IT BACK AND HOW THIS IS REALLY AFFECTING US EACH AND EVERY DAY WE HAVE TWO OF OUR CHIEFS HERE TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLES. AND TELL YOU WHY THIS MODEL CAN BE HARMFUL TO LIFE AND SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS. CHIEF THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE CANDY THAT KEPT US GOING THIS MORNING HOWEVER WAS THAT SO MICHAEL ARE KEY IS FIRE CHIEF MONTEREY COUNTY REGIONAL I'M ALSO HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF. OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE ONE THING A JEEP ACOSTA AND HIT THE TERM MEDICAL CONTROL AND WE NEED TO REITERATE THAT. THIS BILL IS NOT TO DIMINISH THE MEDICAL CONTROL. IN OUR COUNTY IN ALL COUNTIES IN IN CALIFORNIA WE WORK UNDER MEDICAL CONTROL OUR PARAMEDICS WORK UNDER THAT PHYSICIANS LICENSE. TO BUY OUR NARCOTICS UNDER -- THE D. E. A. -- THE PROTOCOLS THAT HERE SHE WRITES WE FOLLOW. SENATOR A WINNER MADE A COMMENT EARLIER IT'S CENTER COPIERS BILL ON A SEQUEL. WHAT MEDICAL CONTROL NOW HAS HAPPENED? THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IT'S LIKE THE TERM SYKORA. ANYTIME IN THE FIRE SERVICE WANTS TO PROMOTE SOMETHING IN EMS OR CAN GO TO THIS TYPE OF CALL AS MEDICAL RELATED. WE HEAR FROM MEDICAL DIRECTORS THAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND THE INTENT OF MEDICAL CONTROL NOW WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT VERSIONS OF WHAT THAT INTENT IS. WE DON'T EVEN GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE. WHEN IT COMES TO DISPATCHING PROTOCOLS WE HAVE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IN MONTEREY COUNTY? THAT ONE OUT WE HAD NO PUBLIC INPUT IT WILL NOW TELL MY FIRE DISTRICT THAT WE CANNOT GO TO CERTAIN CALLS IN MY JURISDICTION. AND WE'RE REAL COUNTY. AS YOU KNOW IN REAL COUNTIES WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTE RESPONSE TIMES WE REQUIRE -- RANCHERS AND FARMERS IN THE STATE HOMES TO PUT IN OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT KNOX KY. WE HAVE TO GO THERE AND OPEN UP THE GATES OF THE ANIMALS CAN GET IN UNDER THIS CURRENT ARE OF P. IN MONTEREY COUNTY THEY DON'T WANT TO GO AND THE PRIVATE. FOR PROFIT AMBULANCE WILL GO. UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TREATMENT AND NON TRANSPORT FEE WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE'VE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT AMBULANCE COMPANIES OVER MY THIRTY TWO YEARS. WE WORK WELL EVERY DAY. WE DON'T WANT THIS BILL TO DIMINISH THAT I KNOW US SENATE REQUIRE I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE LEGENDARY SYSTEM I'VE REFERRED TO THAT SYSTEM FOR YEARS -- AS A A COMPONENT THAT WE WISH WE COULD HAVE UNFORTUNATELY. THE INTERPRETATION OF MEDICAL TROLL ARM AREA IS SEEN YOU CAN'T DO THAT. AND SO AGAIN IT'S BECOME THE SEA BECAUSE WHEN YOU HEAR MEDICAL CONTROL TODAY. WITH OPPOSITION JUST REMEMBER WHAT THE ORIGINAL TENNESSEE CO AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IT BE USED TODAY. WE ISSUE BURKE PERMITS RESIDENTIAL AG BURN PERMITS WE'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY WORSE OUR SEQUIN ELSE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT BACKYARD BURNING. YOU KNOW NOW THEY CHALLENGES ON THAT SAME THING WITH MEDICAL CONTROL. AND WE NEED THIS BILL TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. IS THE FINAL IT HAS TO COME TO US WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE EMS STAKEHOLDERS BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE IT'S NOT A TWO WAY CONVERSATION WE'RE TOLD. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHIEF GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR BEING YES. WHAT WITH THE THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU -- CHAIR AND AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND I'M GONNA BE BRIEF I LEFT MY SCRIPT BACK -- IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR EVERYONE -- TRACY CALIFORNIA RANDALL BRADLEY THIS IS ACTUALLY MY FOURTH COUNTY HAD BEEN A FIRE CHIEF AND ACTUALLY RAN -- EMS PROGRAMS AS FAR AS A LS OF FIRE BASED PROGRAMS AND AND FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES NOW AND I WAS I I WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED WHEN I READ IN SOME LOOKING COUNTY TO FIND OUT THAT. ON THE LOCAL EMS AGENCY -- PREVENTED THAT TRACY FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO A MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WITH OUR JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES ON DISCOUNTED TO THE THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE HAVE SEVERAL CALLS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED WHERE. FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS WERE AVAILABLE NEAR AN INCIDENT ANY THE PEOPLE SUFFERED NEEDLESSLY ARC FOR THEY DIDN'T SURVIVE YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THEY WOULD HAVE SURVIVED ANYWAY BUT WE WILL NEVER KNOW NOW BECAUSE THE FIRE PARAMEDICS DID NOT RESPOND A LOT OF THIS IS REALLY BASED UPON -- THE EMS AGENCIES WANT TO RISK YOU KNOW WANT TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY. PRIVATE AMBULANCES AND THEIR AVAILABILITY AND AND CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD CANCEL PRIVATE AMBULANCES BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE A GOOD CAME NEXT AND WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH INSURANCE -- I THINK THAT IT IS INHERENT FOR FIRE CHIEFS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY FIRE STATIONS BASED UPON THEIR THEIR CITY COUNCIL OR THEIR BOARDS -- SUPPORT CAN FOR THEM FOR THE FIRE CHIEFS TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF CALLS HOW WE RESPOND IN WHAT MANNER WE RESPOND. WE SHOULD WORK WITH ARE YOU MESSAGE AND SEES TO ENSURE THAT WE WE HAVE THE PREDICTABLE AND DEFENDABLE SYSTEM BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN FROM MY COUNTY AGENCY DETERMINE. HOW WAS CITY RESPONSE TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES I THINK CHIEF MCLAUGHLIN'S EXAMPLE OF UTILIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE FOR SHERIFF TO DETERMINE IF A POLICE CHIEF RESPONDED TO AN EMERGENCY OR NOT? BUT FOR SOME REASON -- THERE'S AN OVER REACH FOR EMS AGENCIES AND AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL WILL ADDRESS THAT OVER REACH. WE WE WANT TO STAY OUT OF COURT AND WE WOULD -- LIKE -- TO GET THIS DONE LEGISLATIVELY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH CHIEF. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY THEM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I WAS JUST LETTING UNIFORMS BEFORE BEAUTY TESTIFY. AND SO I HAD. ANYWAY I THINK THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE YOUR STAFF HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY ON THIS MATTER AS THE CHIEF MENTIONED YOU HAVE A MODEL SYSTEM IN YOUR COUNTY WE APPRECIATE THE WORK. TO IDENTIFY WHY THAT HAS FOUND SUCCESS AND MAKE IT A MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT THE A TAMI OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MANAGE. THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES AS THEY'RE TEXTING COMMUNITY EXPECTS AND DEMANDS. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR WORK AS WELL ALWAYS ON SO MANY ISSUES WITH LIKE THAT OPEN UP TO THOSE WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE THIS TIME LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO PLEASE ADVANCE. WE'RE GONNA DO A LAST CALL FOR SUPPORT WE'RE NOT GONNA BRING IT FORWARD FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. THE INTERNET. BERMAN WELCOME US SENATOR PER DAY FIVE IT'S COMING BACK. WE'RE GONNA WELCOME. TO INDIVIDUALS. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WORKER HAVE YET? TO THE CHAIRS TO MY LEFT. GERMAN WE WELCOME YOU. WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WHICH WOULD BE FIVE MINUTES. WE'VE ONE SECONDARY WHICH WOULD BE TWO MINUTES. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE OUR PRIMARY WITNESS -- IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WELCOME SIR IF YOU COULD JUST PULL THAT MICROPHONE CLOSE YOU HIT THE BUTTON OR WILL HIT THE RED LIGHT. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SOME LASSEN ORGANIZATION I DON'T THINK THE CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE UPRIGHT ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS DOCTOR KARL SCHULZE I AM A PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND THE SERVICE THE EMS MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR ORANGE COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE EMS MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. IF SB FOUR THIRTY THIS PAST IT WILL CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO PATIENT CARE. ELIMINATES THE UTHORITY OF LUMP SUM MEDICAL DIRECTORS TO MANDATE APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL DISPATCH POLICIES AND RESTRICTS THE COUNTIES FROM. UTILIZING THE BST COMBINATION OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC DISPATCHES. THAT BEST SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF AS BEFORE THIRTY EIGHT WHIMS AS WILL LOSE CONTROL OF THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF PRE HOSPITAL MEDICAL CARE PROVIDED COUNTY RESIDENTS. MEDICAL DISPATCH WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE EMS SYSTEM WILL SKATE MEDICAL REVIEW. ERRORS MADE BY PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER AGENCIES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO LIMIT THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OVERSIGHT OVER MEDIATION. POSITION OVERSIGHT OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEDICAL INSTRUCTIONS BY EMERGENCY MEDICINE MEDICAL DISPATCHERS WILL BE LOST. AS EMS STANDARDS OF CARE INVOLVED AND IMPROVE IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE DISPATCH STANDARDS KEEP PACE. SINCE SLIM SOME MEDICAL INPUT WILL BE PROHIBITED. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WOULD THREATEN INTEGRATED SYSTEM STATUS MANAGEMENT IT REPLACES THE LAMPS IS PLANNING AN OVERSIGHT OF MEDICAL CALLED PROCESSING AND MEDICAL RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT. WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. AS SUCH THE ASSURANCE THAT THE CLOSEST AMBULANCE RESPONSE FROM MEDICAL EMERGENCY WILL BE LOST. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT BY EXEMPTING PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES FROM MEDICAL CONTROL OF THE LET. MEDICAL CONTROL OF THE LIMB SOME MEDICAL DIRECTOR WOULD ALLOW THESE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TO DEPLOY AND REDEPLOY ITS RESOURCES AS IT SEES FIT EVEN IF IT MEANT RE DIRECTING THE RESOURCE ALREADY ASSIGNED TO OR ACTIVELY TREATING A PATIENT. THE IMPACT OF SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT DOT EIGHT AS WRITTEN IS SO BROAD THAT IT WOULD IN ESSENCE REMOVE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT ENSURES PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. AS WELL AS PRIVATE AGENCIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PUBLIC A TO A MEDICAL OVERSIGHT. IN SUMMARY SB FORTY EIGHT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH BY PROMOTING. MEETING LIMB SOME MEDICAL DIRECTORS FROM THE PLANNING OVERSIGHT OF MEDICAL CALL PROCESSING MEDICAL DISPATCH AND MEDICAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION. IN ADDITION THE BILL TIES THE HANDS OF COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PREVENTS THEM FROM IMPLEMENTING THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE INTEGRATED EMS SYSTEM. USING A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE [inaudible] PROVIDERS. AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN IN THE E. ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE PATIENT CARDIAC ARREST. THE MEMBERS OF THE OUR TEAM WORKED WITH ME AND SERVED UNDER MY MEDICAL DIRECTION. IF TEAM MEMBERS WERE PERMITTED TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT MY MEDICAL OVERSIGHT AND PURSE PURSUE INTERVENTIONS NOT SUPPORTED OR DIRECTED BY SOUND POSITION CONTROL. THE PATIENT WOULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT HARM. THIS IS THE EXACT SITUATION CREATED BY SB. FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR. THIRD THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES IF YOU DON'T MIND YOU MISTER FIRST LAST YEAR ORGANIZATION THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US TODAY AND DO APOLOGIZE HAS BEEN.

THE LESSONS WE LEARNED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES NINETEEN SEVENTIES TAUGHT US THAT A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO MEDICINE. TO THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THESE BENEFITS IN THE IN THESE LESSONS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WHEN IT PASSED THE EMS SYSTEM ACT. WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM FOR DELIVERY OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. NINETEEN EIGHTY CALIFORNIA'S HODGE PODGE PATCHWORK FOR THE LIVERY OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE PREHOSPITAL CARE WAS REPLACED WITH A FRAMEWORK TO FOSTER INCREASE STATEWIDE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. FOR THE UNIVERSAL DELIVERY OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO ALL OF OUR CITIZENS. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN THE M. S. RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION IN THE PREEMINENT ROLE OF THE PHYSICIAN MEDICAL DIRECTOR IN PLANNING IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING. EMS SYSTEMS OF CARE. WE DO NOT DOUBT THE SINCERITY OF THE SUPPORTERS OF SP FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THE BELIEVE IT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THE M. AS MEDICAL ACTOR. AND OUTSIDE OF THE EMS SYSTEM. HOWEVER NOT WITHSTANDING THE SINCERE BELIEFS WE KNOW FROM THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST THIRTY NINE YEARS THAT EXISTING SYSTEM. FOR THE IN AGREE FOR INTEGRATED DELIVERY I'M OF EM US IS BEST FOR PATIENT OUTCOMES. MEDICINE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIALIZATION. WE HAVE SPECIALIZED HOSPITALS TO CARE FOR CALLING PATIENTS BECAUSE IT RESULTS IN BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SPECIALIZED DMS DISPATCH CENTERS. FICTION OUTCOMES IMPROVED BY USING A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO CARE THAT RECOGNIZE SPECIALIZED CENTERS WHERE THEY PROVIDE TRAUMA CARE OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL DISPATCH. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW EXISTING INTEGRATED SYSTEMS THAT WORK VERY EFFECTIVELY AND SONOMA SAN JOAQUIN FRESNO COUNTY IN OTHERS. TO BECOME BALKANIZED AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. CURRENTLY WE'VE IDENTIFIED.

BY THAT WILL BE TAKEN IT ISN'T SO THAT EVERYONE HAS IT -- IT WOULD FOCUS ON JP EIGHTIES. THAT HAVE. BOUGHT FIRE AGENCIES. DEPARTMENTS OR DISTRICTS ALREADY AT THE TABLE. OF THE JPA. I IN THAT IT ALSO STATES THAT IT THE CONSENSUS ANY RENT RENEGOTIATION OR ADOPTION. OF A FUTURE AGREEMENT SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FIVE THE COMMITTEE HAS THE AGREED UPON AMENDMENT. WE DO APOLOGIZE IF THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND FORTH AND WHAT THIS AMENDMENT ESSENTIALLY FOCUSES ON ON SIMILAR TYPE. OF GPAS THAT WOULD BE. DEVELOPED IN THIS BILL -- IN ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE CINEMA COUNTY WHERE YOU ALREADY HAVE A FIRE CHIEFS. AT THE TABLE ALONG WITH ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL. SO WOULD LIKE TO BETTER OPEN UP FOR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE FROM THE COMMITTEE AND QUESTIONS FOR SENATOR HERTZBERG WE ALSO WOULD ACCEPT A MOTION AT THIS TIME [inaudible] CENTER CHANNEL. YES SIR JUST KIND OF WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE -- INFORMATION FOR REALLY WANTED TO EXPRESS IT SO I REPRESENT AT TWENTY THREE CITIES AND SENATE DISTRICT FOURTEEN SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE A DISPATCH MY CITY THE CITY WHERE I WHERE I COME FROM DOESN'T HAVE A DISPATCH. SO -- YOU KNOW IT IT WE STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY TO BE ABLE. TO TO TO HAVE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE THAT THE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE THE SYSTEM THERE AND SO I THINK THAT -- TODAY I WILL BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND AND SUPPORT YOUR BOOK AND CONCEPT BUT EIGHT I WOULD LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO BE. PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS REALLY WANT. BUT FOR THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES. THAT I COME FROM -- IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED SO WOULD LOVE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SENATOR REJECT RETURN THIS IS ONE OF THE PLEASE -- THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER TADO EIGHT WE HEAR YOUR YEAR OF ASSERTIONS AND CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THIS IS WHY WE LIKE FIRE DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED IN THESE DECISION MAKING SO YOUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. RECEIVE A RESPONSE AND IT IS NOT BASED ON ANY OTHER. A DEMOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC ISSUE IN YOUR COUNTY SO WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO WORK WITH YOU -- DIRECTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS WORKABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND THAT YOU'RE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS CAN HAVE A ROLE IN MAKING THOSE [inaudible] RESPONSE DECISION. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU CENTER. PLEASE CENTER NIELSEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS IT WILL GO TO CENTER ABOUT. IN GENERAL I HAVE NOT SUPPORTED SUCH BILLS. TODAY I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL NUMBER ONE I RESPECT THE DIRECTION. AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT THE AUTHOR. AND I WOULD ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S MERIT IN PROMOTING SOME DALOGUE. AND I'M ONE WHO IS DEL PROBABLY IS MEANT MANDATE MUCH WITH THESE. SITUATIONS AS ANYBODY AROUND HERE [inaudible] AND I REMEMBER ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS GOING TO BE SENDING AWARDS TO A BUNCH OF EMS DISPATCHERS AND AND THERE WAS A OF SERGEANT. FROM THE POLICE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CAME UP SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LOSING YOUR CROWD HERE. CENTER THERE'S A BEEN A FOURTEEN CAR PILEUP ON INTERSTATE FIVE AND THEY'RE ALL EVEN. THE END OF THAT. THAT'S NOT HEALTH INCREDIBLE THAT IS THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEIN HONORED FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE OUR RESPONSE. A HUGE CRISIS AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS NOW. I THINK THAT THE THE FOLKS WHO OF WHAT THE TESTIFIED TO IN IN OPPOSITION THERE'S SOME MERIT IN THEIR ARGUMENTS AND I WITH. VOTE IN BOTH TRADITIONS SUCH PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE. LET'S HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION AND AS MS BOMB HAS INDICATED. OUR DESIRE I KNOW THAT CERTAINLY. MISSED HERTZBERG NOBODY IS BETTER AROUND HERE WE GO SHE'D. SO I WILL BE AVAILABLE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR NIELSEN THANK YOU BRIAN THAT PERSPECTIVE AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AS WELL SIR. THE DEAN AND SENATE -- THAT'S GO TO SENATOR ABOUT -- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL I I WANTED TO TELL YOU THOUGH I WANT TO SEE. WORK ON GETTING THE COUNTIES IN THE CITIES. CLOSER TOGETHER ON THIS IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE. AND THERE'S SO. ONE REASON WHY I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL. TO GET TO GO IN THIS DIRECTION IS IT. WE TRIED THE BOTH WAYS AND WIRE AND SAN JOSE. AND WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH -- PRIVATE CONTRACTING THE MLS BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIG CITY WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF POPULATION -- MULTICULTURAL POPULATION AND WE FOUND THAT -- OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD. A BETTER TRAIN FORCE TO DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF POPULATION. THEN THE EMS OF SYSTEMS. SO IT AND ALSO -- THE MEDICAL STAFF AT THE HOSPITALS ARE USED TO DEAL WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. SO THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD -- AND IS STRONGER AND AND AND AND THE BOTTOM LINE WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE RESPONSE TIME RIGHT. SO THE RESPONSE TIMES TURNED OUT TO BE BETTER. SO SO THE PUBLIC WANTS BETTER RESPONSE TIME. WE HAD WE HAD A CONTRACTOR THAT CONSISTENTLY WAS PENALIZED FOR NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS RESPONSE TIME. THAT'S LIKE NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO YOU HAVE TO YOU YOU KNOW THE THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE. YOU KNOW THIS THIS CONCEPT IS. WHERE WE HAVE EVOLVED? TO IN TERMS OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY. SO I JUST -- THAT'S BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO WORK ON GETTING THE HOSPITALS. AND THE EMERGENCY -- TRAUMA CENTERS. TIGHTER WITH EMS SYSTEMS. THAT THE PROBABLY BE A SUGGESTION ON THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER. I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY CLOSE YES CENTERS FOR PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO IN IT'S JUST IT'S BY I FIND IT QUITE ENLIGHTENING THE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY EMERGING MEDICAL SERVICE A. G. PROVIDE A MEMO WITH THE COURT CASE -- THAT ONE POINT BUT THE THING IS PROBATIVE IS A NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SUPREME COURT CASE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE VALLEY MEDICAL TRANSPORT. AT PAGE SEVEN SIXTY ONE AND I THINK THE QUOTE INFORMS THE REASON FOR THIS MEASURE. THE LEGISLATURE APPEARS TO HAVE ASSUMED IN DRAFTING SECTION -- SEVENTY NINE SEVENTY NINETY SEVEN POINT TWO OH ONE THAT SITES THAT CITY HIS ME THE CITIES AND FAR DISTRICTS HAVE INTEREST IN MAINTAINING CALL THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. THAT ARE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY ADVERSE TO COUNTY INTEREST IN THE SAME. AND THAT THERE FOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THESE PUBLIC ENTITIES BOTH POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE. IF THAT ASSUMPTIONS PROVED IT IS PROVEN HISTORICALLY TO BE INCORRECT THE DISTRICT OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED PUBLIC ENTITIES MUST RESORT TO THE LEGISLATURE NOT THE COURTS TO AMEND THE EMS ACT.
