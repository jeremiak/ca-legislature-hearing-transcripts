I PARTICULARLY WANT TO UPLIFT THE INVESTMENTS INTO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR CHILDREN THAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT BELIEVE WE HAVE FURTHER TO GO AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING EQUITY AS WELL AS OUR WORK FORCE SHORTAGES. I ALSO WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS ON FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN REFINE THE HELD FOR ALL PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD. AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS HERE TODAY. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH A PANEL ONE. FOUR PANEL ONE WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY DR MARK GALLI THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR DR THOMAS ARAGON AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR SUSAN FINALE AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THIS PANEL UNTIL AFTER ALL OF THE PRISONERS HAVE CONCLUDED LET US BEGIN WITH SECRETARY DR GALLEY. THANK YOU- DR RANDALL CHAIRMAN- AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU HERE THIS AFTERNOON- I LOOK FORWARD TO KICKING US OFF AND THEN AT FIRST- LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES- LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT IT OPERATES BAND TO SUBURBAN THE ROLE THAT I'VE HAD IT WITH OUR ENTIRE TEAM AND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER- YOU KNOW LOCKED IN ARMS- FIGURATIVELY OF COURSE- WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. IN PUBLIC HEALTH ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE SACRIFICES THEIR VISION HARD WORK THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS IS SECOND TO NONE- I'M YOU START CALL THEM COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS ARE AND HAVE REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH SO MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA SMALL COUNTIES THE COUNTIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE FOCUSED ON THE RESPONSE TO COBRA AND I USED WHERE ARE WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT- THE TRAJECTORY OF THE DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA- ARE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THROUGH LIKE IT HAS- ACROSS THE NATION- LONGER TORTUROUS ROAD BUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY- GIVES ME CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. WORKING ON THESE IMPORTANT EFFORTS RUN BACK TO NATION'S MAKING SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILT UP TO TRACK THE PANDEMIC. CONTINUE I NOT SAID WE ALL. THAT FOR MANY YEARS THE OF HEALTH. HAS BEEN CHEN. THAT THERE ARE UP. TO BUILD THAT UP. AND TO BE INNOVATIVE AND POWERFUL. AND THE WORK DURING THE LAST YEAR AND WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED WITH COVERT HAS REALLY REQUIRED US TO PUT ON OUR PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD AND WORK WITH SYSTEMS THAT CERTAINLY WERE NOT. ALWAYS AS PREPARED AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM TO BE WHETHER IT WAS ON THE I. T. AND DATE UP FRONT OR THE PERSON OUTSIDE TO DO IMPORTANT WORK OUR TESTING CONTACT. RACINE- QUARANTINE IN ICE- THE WORK MOST RECENTLY ON VACCINATION MODELING THE DISEASE ALL OF THESE IMPORTANT ASPECTS ARE I THINK WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL DONE AS WELL AS WE CAN. BUT I RECOGNIZE THE REAL OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IMPORTANT ADDITIONS FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO BUILD THAT RESOURCE UP. I DO THINK AS WE ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD THAT TAKING A MOMENT AND RECOGNIZING THAT RESOURCES THAT BUILD UPON WHAT WE HAVE NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THE IMMEDIATE WORK OF CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC. WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO RETURNING TO SOME OF THOSE OTHER UBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE SIDELINE OKAY IN LIEU OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO DOING THOSE OVER THE NEXT MANY. WEEKS AND MONTHS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA SAFE ACROSS ALL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES BUT ALSO TAKE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE DOLLARS THREE MILLION TO BE SPECIFIC. TO BRING TOGETHER COUNTIES. THE STATE TOGETHER TO DETERMINE HOW WE ARE REALLY OUR INNOVATIVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO A TWENTY FIRST EVEN THE TWENTY SECOND CENTURY. PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WE HAVE LEARNED. ABOUT THE GAPS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE COULD MAKE THE DECISION TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN THOSE EXISTING AREAS- ALL THE SAME OR WE CAN TAKE A MOMENT. AND AS I'VE SAID- THE HOBBIT PANDEMIC- HAS BEEN OUR GREAT BIG SALARY FOR CHANGE IT HAS UNMASKED SOME OF OUR MOST. IMPORTANT PROBABILITIES- THE INEQUITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN NEVER MORE OBVIOUS THAN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE IN INNOVATIVE WAYS MAKING INVESTMENTS NOT JUST IN THE CORE FEATURES OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HELP SUPPORT US WITH A PANDEMIC. BUT EVEN MORE I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE DID AROUND HEALTHEQUITY. INC OVER TO BRIDGE THAT GAP AROUND HEALTHEQUITY EVEN CHRONIC ILLNESS THE APPROACH OF USING AN EQUITY MEASURE ON TEST POSITIVITY. AND TRYING IT TO OUR OUR BLUEPRINT FOR A SAFER ECONOMY RAISES IDEAS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE A SIMILAR CONSTRUCT TO BUILD. THE BRIDGE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND POPULATION HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY AND OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE OPPORTUNITY IS BEING PROPOSED IN OTHER PARTS. OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND A REVISED WHETHER IT'S IN THE AREAS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ON THE BACKS OF THE CALLIN PROPOSAL AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH STATE PUBLIC HEALTH WITH OUR HEALTH PLAN PARTNERS THAT ARE THINKING. CREATIVELY AND INNOVATIVELY ABOUT. PERSONAL SO THESE THE ARE OUR CHANCES THING MUCH DIFFERENTLY ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BEFORE. AND TOGETHER LOCAL. STATE LEADERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST CLEARING- I THINK MOST INDIVIDUALS ARE AWARE THAT THE DATA CHALLENGES LIVED BOTH AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL WE HAVE VARIOUS SYSTEMS AND REGIONS AND CAL MEANS THAT PLUG INTO THE STATE'S SYSTEMS. IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND THE NEED. TO NOT ONLY MAKE INVESTMENTS IN WHAT WE HAVE A READY TO BUILD THEM UP TO RETHINK THE ARCHITECTURE OF THOSE SYSTEMS ENTIRELY OUT WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO THAT NOW I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE DIFFICULTY I'M HAVING STAFF AT THE READY FOR ALL THE FUNCTIONS. IN BIG COUNTIES AND SMALL COMPANIES ALIKE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE- DO THE WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND BRING BACK TOGETHER MAYBE EVEN SUGGESTING SOME REGIONAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES WHETHER ON THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE SITES OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. I ALSO CALL ON THE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN PUBLIC HELP TO REALLY LEAD IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE ONE OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT AROUND CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS A VERY IMPORTANT- PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION- CAMPAIGN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THAT I AND WE HAVE ALWAYS SEEN AS CORE- TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION. AND BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS LOCALLY AND AT THE STATE ARE POISED AND PREPARED TO BUILD ON THAT SO. THE PROPOSAL- THAT WE ADVANCED AND- MAY REVISE IS ONE THIRD OF IT KNOWLEDGE IS THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH. KNOWLEDGE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AND WORK AND PLAN ACROSS LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THOSE. INVESTMENTS THOUGHTFUL TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS WE CAN BE PROPER UP NOT A IN THIS RUN JUST UP THE THAT ARE IMPRTANT NOW BUT THAT RELEASED US UP. FOR DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES THAT LAY AHEAD I THINK ABOUT ROUTE I THINK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK ABOUT THE ON GOING. IMPORTANT CRITICAL WORK ON HEALTHEQUITY AND EQUITY LARGE AS REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO THESE AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND WORK ITS COURSE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND- OF A TURN IT BACK TO YOU- CHAIRMAN TO. HELP WITH ANY ADDITIONAL PARTS. OF THE PRESENTATION OR QUESTION. THANK YOU DR GOLLY NECK WE WILL HEAR DOCTOR ERICA. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE I WANT TO- THINK OF THE CHAIRMAN AND ALL OF THE FOLKS OUT IN THE AUDIENCE ESPECIALLY THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WERE REALLY- DO THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AS- PUBLIC HEALTH HAPPENS NOT JUST THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ABSOLUTELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE ACTIVE RESPONSE AS WE OPEN UP OUR ECONOMY WE KNOW THAT RISK IS GOING TO INCREASE IN SO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE VERY ACTIVATED WEEK WE STILL NEED TO DO- CASE FINDING A CASE OF INSTIGATION CONTACT TRACING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT ANY FIRES ACROSS THE STATE AS WE OPEN UP THE ECONOMY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO VACCINATE FOLKS AND GET OUR COMMUNITY IMMUNITY UP AS MUCH AS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN TO ALSO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT BOTH THE BUSINESSES THE COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH IN THIS ENDEAVOR BECAUSE WE STILL ARE AN ACTIVATION MODE WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF STAFF THAT ARE ACTIVATED. SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS WORKING WITH A LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS LOOKING BETTER SYSTEMS FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVATED AND ACTUALLY PUT THEM BACK INTO CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT'S NOT GETTING DONE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ACTIVATED SO THAT IT IS PLANNING TIME THAT WE HAVE. IS REALLY CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STABILIZE OUR SYSTEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT AND THAT WE SPEND THE TIME DOING A THOUGHTFUL ASSESSMENT OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM OF THE OTHER OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE WITH WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT COME IN IN THE COMING WEEKS AND- THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO ADD TO DR. KELLY'S COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE WILL HEAR FOR CHEAP CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR SUSAN FANELLI. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THE SECRETARY OR DIRECTOR'S REMARKS BUT STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM FINALLY WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS- SEND YOU A PIC FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. OFFICE I WANT TO START BY MENTIONING THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT POLICY PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN REVISION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET. AND IN FACT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GENERAL FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MOST OF THE FUNDING 82% IS GOING TO COPE AND RELATED ACTIVITIES. AND WHEN YOU SORT OF REMOVE THOSE ACTIVITIES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S GENERAL FUND BUDGET. IT LEAVES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I'M SORRY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO NEXT I WANT TO TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF- IT REALLY THE END IMMIGRANTS SPONSOR VIEW PROPOSAL REALLY MENTIONS KEY THREE KEY ASPECTS THE FIRST BEING. TO ASSESS THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN. THE SECOND IS TO REVIEW THE CENTRAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND RESOURCES. AND THE THIRD IS TO ASSESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO ARE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. ANDREALLY THIS IS- THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- ADDRESSES- IS THAT- NOTES THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE DONE REALLY TO INFORM A PROPOSAL AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY. NOW THE TIMING THE PROPOSAL MENTIONS THAT THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BEGIN NOW AS DR ERIC ON JUST MENTIONED- AND THAT IF THEY WANTED TO USE A VENDOR TO HELP WITH THE STUDY THAT WOULD BE PROCURED IN JULY. AND THEN BY SEPTEMBER- THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING  BUDGET PROPOSAL. I WOULD NOTE THAT OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ARE UNKNOWN FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE FOR CONDUCTING THE STUDY WHAT THE DELIVERABLES WOULD BE ASIDE FROM THE ULTIMATE- BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD WOULD BE PRESENTED IN JANUARY. AND WE'RE NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT THE EXPENDITURES OF THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY BE FOR ASIDE FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF HIRING OF A VENDOR OR OR COMP OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR. NO WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE TIMING AND THE RESPONSE COMPONENT THE RESPONSE REVIEW COMPONENT OF THE STUDY UP HERE CAN TO WHAT'S CALLED AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW. I'M AFTER ACTION REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A PUBLIC HEALTH INVENTOR OTHER TYPE OF EMERGENCY- FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY- CONDUCTED THEIR AFTER ACTION REVIEW OF HURRICANE KATRINA JUST FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE HURRICANE STARTED. AND IT'S REALLY HELPED TO MEN YEAH IT'S REALLY MEANT TO HELP KEEP PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY WHAT WENT WELL WHAT MAYBE DIDN'T GO SO WELL WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO I JUST. WANT TO RAISE A FEW- A FEW KEY POINTS FIRST. OUR OFFICE RECOGNIZES THAT CONDUCTING AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW IS BOTH CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING A PROCESS SEES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE. BUT WE WOULD NOT THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS MUCH BROADER DESPITE THE- THE AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. NOT ONLY DOES THE REVIEW PROPOSED TO ASSESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN BUT IT ALSO PROPOSES TO ASSESS A COMPLEX SET OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN RESOURCE NEEDS AND THEN THE THIRD ASPECT- LOOKING AT THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES THAT WERE EXACERBATED BY COPE WITH NINETEEN. I NEXT WE POINT OUT THAT THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE SOME DUPLICATION WITH ANOTHER STUDY THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THE AGENCY IS PROPOSING A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERSECTION OF COVERT NINETEEN AND DISPARITIES. NO GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THE CODE NINETEEN HAD ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW WAGE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. A HEALTH EQUITY LENS APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THE APPROPRIATE LENSES THROUGH WHICH TO CONDUCT A PANDEMIC OR RESPONSE REVIEW. HOWEVER AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE- DPH AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY EFFORTS WOULD BE COORDINATED SO AS NOT TO DUPLICATE- EFFORTS WHEN LOOKING AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES. I'M FINALLY I'D LIKE TO RAISE SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. FIRST WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER BREAKING THIS PROPOSAL INTO TWO STUDIES THE FIRST WOULD BE AN AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW A QUICKLY. I'M SORRY A STUDY THAT'S DONE QUICKLY- COULD LIKELY BE DONE IN HOUSE AND COULD LIKELY BE DONE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY IT CAN REALLY HELP WITH NEAR TERM DECISION MAKING CLOSING IDENTIFIED GAPS IN CAPACITY EXPERTISE OR OR PLANNING CAPABILITIES. THE SECOND STUDY WOULD THEN BE A MULTI YEAR ASSESSMENT. THIS WOULD BE A MORE OMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE NEEDS OF BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEVEL- BUT IT COULD ALSO TAKE A- TAKE A STEP BACK AND EVEN LOOK AT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS- GOVERNANCE. STRUCTURES. FINALLY WE SUGGESTED THAT- THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER BRIDGE FUNDING TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHILE BOTH OF THESE STUDIES ARE UNDER WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A RESERVE FOR FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. DEREK HAS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS AMONG THE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- BOTH. DEPARTMENTS AT BOTH LEVELS HAVE HAVE DEALT WITH DECLINING LEVELS OF FUNDING OVER THE YEARS AS WELL AS FUNDING THAT'S HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE IN NATURE. AND WHILE BOTH- STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE AN INFLUX OF FEDERAL FUNDING RIGHT NOW THAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS REALLY- SPECIFIC TO THE COVERT RESPONSE. ALTERNATELY TIME LIMITED- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER SOME AMOUNT OF ONGOING ANNUAL SUPPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL HEALTH JUST JURISDICTIONS BEGINNING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER EAST CENTRAL NON CODE NINETEEN OR- PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES- WE WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED THIS FUNDING BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE. IN ADDITION THIS FUNDING COULD HELP BOTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RETAIN SOME OF THE STAFF THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE AND TRAIN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINDINGS FROM BOTH OF THE STUDIES- AND SORT OF RE CALIBRATE FUNDING LEVELS- AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES- ONCE THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM BOTH THE IMMEDIATE. AFTER ACTION REVIEW AS WELL AS THE MULTI YEAR ASSESSMENT. AND THEN FINALLY IF THESE- RATHER TO PREPARE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A FUNDING RESERVES THIS YEAR IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- SUPPORTED BY AVAILABLE REVENUES FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING PURPOSES. I THANK YOU DOCTOR IN DELAND I'M I'M THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A OPPORTUNITY TO DR ERICA PAN WHO IS ALSO SCHEDULED TO BE ON THIS PANEL IF SHE HAS ANY COMMENTS- IF SHE DOES NOT WE WILL TURN THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS BUT DR PAM WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THIS DISCUSSION- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD FROM A DOCTOR. AND A DOCTOR KELLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL BRING IT UP FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND THANK YOU TO THE PANEL- I- I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE A DOCTOR GOLLY AND HIS TEAM FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ANY KNOWLEDGE AND- HE AND I SPOKE THIS MORNING I OBVIOUSLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING AND- APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF OUR DISCUSSION AND HAVE A I THINK I NOW HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO WANTS TO GO HERE. I GUESS MY CONCERN. IS IN A STATEMENT ACTUALLY ONE OF THE I COULD I WOULD WRITE THIS DOWN. ABOUT OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE DURING COPE IT. AND AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I FEEL STRONG SO STRONGLY ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AT THIS POINT. I THINK OF MY OWN COUNTIES. AND ONCE IT ONE IN PARTICULAR. THAT RECENTLY IN RECENT YEARS- WAS- SEEN UPTICKS IN- SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES HEPATITIS C. H. I. V- AND- PUTTING THAT IN THE BACKDROP. OF A TEN YEAR. DECLINE IN THE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS AND PRACTICALLY HAVING TO BEG FOR RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THESE THESE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT WERE SURFACING IN THE COMMUNITY- I ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT. I THAT HE- DR GOTTLIEB POINTED OUT ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION- AND THEN THE SYSTEMS THERE HAD OUR SYSTEMS YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW BEEN IN A BETTER SHAPE IN SOME CASES OR HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO IF WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD BETTER HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AT COMMUNICATING WITH HEALTH ENTITIES ONE ANOTHER AND WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON ON DISEASE SURVEILLANCE. THROUGHOUT THE- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SHOWING THE GREATEST IS DISPARITIES IF WE CANNOT HAVE THE DATA. TO- TO ANALYZE IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN IDENTIFYTHE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO BACK IN THE BACKGROUND TO SUPPORT THAT. AND THAT IS IT AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PUBLIC POPULATION HEALTH THE PART THAT I THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT DOES TROUBLE ME A LITTLE BIT IN THE LISTENING TO THE L. A. O. NEED TO DIGEST A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING BUT- DO WONDER IF THAT IS IF IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BREAK THIS INTO PIECES- AND- AND THAT'S SOMETHING I DIDN'T DIDN'T KNOW OR DIDN'T EXPECT TO HEAR- AND APPRECIATE HEARING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FACE IS A WORKFORCE PROBLEM WE'RE ALREADY FACING WORKFORCE PROBLEM MANY PUBLIC HEALTH- PEOPLE WORKING PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE BEEN BURNED OUT. OVER WORKED. AND WE'D WE DESPERATELY NEED TO REINVEST IN WORKFORCE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING NOW. YEAH I DON'T SEE THAT WE I DON'T SEE THAT A DELAY REALLY REALLY HELPS US HELPS US IN THAT. AND THEN- FINALLY- I WANNA SEE. THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT IF WE ARE GIVING. RE STATE RESOURCES TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT GO DIRECTLY TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THAT THERE BE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE OTHER END- I BELIEVE NOW THAT A LOT OF MONEY GOES TO COUNTIES IF I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME. IN THE COUNTIES DECIDE WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO AND MY EXPERIENCES THERE IS OFTEN A LITTLE BIT OF A SHUFFLING AND THINGS ARE GOING ON THERE AND THAT THAT IF WE'RE DEDICATING MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IT NEEDS TO GO TO PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT IN RETURN FOR THAT. THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO. SEE THE SEE THE RESULTS OF THOSE THOSE- THOSE INVESTMENTS AND SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND- I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ON THE OTHER END WANTS TO RESPOND ANY OF THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO. APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH WITH. MOST OF YOUR OVERTIME AND WANT TO CONTINUE THAT TO DO THAT IN A POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. THANK YOU. OUR IS IT OKAY IF I RESPOND TO A TALK TO WORK PLEASED DR KELLY. RIGHT AND SO DR THANK YOU AND YES APPRECIATE OUR ON GOING CONVERSATIONS AND THE SPIRIT OF YOUR COMMENTS TODAY CERTAINLY I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT ED ARE ALSO- THIS PRODUCT COMMENTS ARE APPRECIATE THEM AND THINKING ABOUT THE AFTER ACTION REPORT STYLE WHICH IS OF COURSE NECESSARY ON. AN INTERIM AFTER ACTIONS ARE OCCURRING ALL ALONG pPANDEMIC RESPONSE FOR THE STATE FOR THE NATION COUNTY BY COUNTY IS GOING TO UNDERGO. THOSE IMPORTANT AFTER ACTION. REPORTS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT LOOKING FORWARD ARM WHAT WAS PROPOSED AS A POTENTIAL MULTI YEAR APPROACH I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT CAN INFORM SUCH INVESTMENTS OVER THE LONG TERM- GLOBAL ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR STATE. HOW IT'S DIVIDED AND STORMS OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES WITHIN COUNTIES WITHIN THE STATE ARE POTENTIALLY A REGIONAL ASPECT AS WELL IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WORK FORCES CHALLENGED WHERE SOME OF THE- TOOLS ARE NOT IN THE ABUNDANCE THAT YOU NEED- IN CERTAIN PLACES WHEN THERE'S ISSUES THAT ARISE CRISES THAT ARISE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A HEAD START ON SOME OF THAT WORK- COUNTY IS THE STATE HAS BEEN CONSIDERING- SO MANY OF THESE THINGS NOW AND THAT BEING ABLE. TO DO THAT SOONER THAN MULTIPLE YEARS IS WHAT OUR BELIEF IS BUT VERY MUCH IN THE SAME SPIRIT. THAT THE- OF VALUATION IS COMPREHENSIVE IT'S NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE SPECIFIC PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE THAT EXIST TODAY OF COURSE SOME OF THOSE TOOLS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN. STRENGTHENED BUT ALSO. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF HOW HEALTH WORKS IN THE STATE. SHOULD BE OUR READ CANCER RIACH IN THE AND THAT WE HAVE DONE SOME OF THE YOUR THING. AND PROCESS OR ON THAT POINT SO- EXACT. TWO RICK THE FOR. HAVING TO BRING TOGETHER THESE CONCEPTS TO THOSE QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO BE READY AND- THIS JAN WITH THOUGHT. COMPREHEND PROPOSAL IT IS ALL NEVER GOING TO- CAPTURE EVERY LAW ASPECT OF WILL BE. CONSIDERING PUBLIC HEALTH IS VERY DYNAMIC WELL OF ALL. CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS IT HAS OVER THE YEAR OVER TIME SO. I WILL NEED TO REMAIN NUMBER. AND QUICK RESPOND BUT WE BUT- THAT OUR SICK. AMOUNT OF THE SUGGESTED MULTI YEAR REVIEW COULD BE DONE- TOGETHER WITH OUR LOCAL- AS WELL AS ST COLLEAGUES. OVER THE NEXT MONNING MONTHS. COMMITTEE THIS IS JUST A FOLLOW UP TONIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR GOLLY AND I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. I JUST WANTED A I DO WANT TO POINT OUT JUST ONE THING AND IT IT IT'S JUST START BE THINKING ABOUT AS YOU WERE TALKING- YOU KNOW IRONICALLY. SOME OF OUR SMALLEST COUNTIES HAVE DONE REMARKABLY WELL DURING THIS AS FAR AS THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS AND I'LL POINT OUT MENDOCINO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE DOCTOR AND CORENT. HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN MENDOCINO COUNTY- I COUNTY OF EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WIN THIS COBIT STARTED THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT CONSISTED OF A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AND THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE HAS BEEN- TRULY ASTOUNDING SO I HOPE THAT AS WE START TO READ RE ENVISION PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE WILL LOOK TO SOME OF THE- THE- SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES THAT BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY MORE EFFICIENT OR BETTER. LEAN AND MEAN GOT IT DONE AND IN MANY IN MANY MANY AREAS AND CONTINUES TO GET IT DONE ON A DAILY BASIS SO. I JUST A PLUG FOR MY- MY RURAL COUNTIES. ALL ECHO THAT- DOCTOR WOULD DIE I ENJOYED WORKING WITH SO MANY. OF THOSE SMALL NIMBLE ROLE COUNTIES I GOT TO THEM VERY WELL AND PROUD TO KNOW THEM IN THE HARD WORK THAT THEY DID AND IT'S BEEN TREMENDOUS. SO YOUR POINT IS A VALUABLE ONE IN NEEDS TO BE. TAUGHT FULLY INTEGRATED IN. ANY ASSESSMENT BOTH IN THE SHORT RUN AND ALONGER TERM- ASSESSMENT THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO DOING. THANK YOU SEE NO MORE MEMBERS QUESTIONS I'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE CHAIR AND I WANTED TO DIG IN ON SOMETHING THE DOCTOR WOULD HAD MENTIONED AND- REALLY FOCUS ON EQUITY. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. YOUR CARE DELIVERED IS DETERMINED BY YOUR ZIP CODE. IT WOULD APPEAR AT THE MOMENT THAT IT'S THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AND THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CARE THAT YOU GET. AND THAT SEEMS COUNTER TO MANY OF THE EQUITY PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE AND WAS HOPING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD COMMENT ON. YEAH DR EMULATE THANK YOU AND YOU AND I HAVE ENJOYED CONVERSATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC ABOUT. THE ON GOING NEED TO BE MORE EQUITY FOCUSED AND FOR US THAT MEANS IN PART BUT NOT ONLY. TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE DRIVEN TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN GRAVELY IMPACTED I THINK ONE THING THAT WE WIL SEE. PLAINER AND PLAINER AS WE DO THESE REVIEWS EVERYDAY IS THAT UNDERLYING HEALTH DISPARITIES STROKE COPD OUTCOMES MORE THAN WE THINK- THAT THE INCREASE IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY EXPERIENCE BUT CERTAIN COP COMMUNITIES. CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BY ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ARE GOING TO BE LINKED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY CARE- PREVENTATIVE CARE EXCEPT TRUCK THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTROL COMMON CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES OBESITY- HEART DISEASE EXCEPT FOR US SO. WE HAVE OUR WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT I THINK WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LEARNING DURING COVERED AND CAN APPLY THOSE. IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SYSTEM INVESTMENTS I THINK THE CATALAN PROPOSAL THAT'S IN FRONT OF. ALL OF YOU AS WELL REALLY DOES ELEVATE OUR THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AROUND HEALTH EQUITY AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE BUILDING AND- ACCESS TO SERVICES. NOT JUST BASED ON- ZIP CODE BUT REALLY TRYING TO LINK SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT TELEHEALTH AND VIRTUAL VISITS SOME OF THOSE TRANSITIONS IN CARE LOOKING AT SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND THEN BRINGING IT BACK TO BEHAVIORAL. SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS SEXUAL IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT WHICH I THINK REALLY TO ELEVATE HEALTHEQUITY BUT BRINGING IT BACK TO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK ONE PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT FRANKLY IT'S HARD TO EVEN SAY IT HASN'T BEEN- INVESTED IN ADEQUATELY IN SOME WAYS IT'S INVISIBLE. AND THAT IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH LINK TO THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM BUT WORK AROUND CHRONIC DISEASE AND PREVENTION REAL OPPORTUNITY WHEREIN WE INVEST. ONGOING DOLLARS. IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND HEALTH DELIVERY WELL WE ARE FAILED TO INTEGRATE COMPLETELY RAGE HAT POPULATION HEALTH AND THAT INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. STRUCTURE SO I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND THEN ON THE WORK FOR FIRST ARE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE FOCUSED PROGRAMS- THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WHETHER IT'S- GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. OR BRINGING TOGETHER MORE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS THAT IT AS I'VE SAID BEFORE WALK TO WORK NO THE COMMUNITIES AND CAN DELIVER ON EQUITY IN SOME IMPORTANT WAYS THAT THESE ARE TREMENDOUS CHANCES TO BUILD UP THAT WORKFORCE. IN ORDER TO MEET THE HEALTH NEEDS OF DIVERSE. POPULATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I DID WANT TO SURE THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR WORK WITH AND CALAMP FROM THE THOUGHT OF US AS WELL AS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSAL AS I DO THINK THAT REALLY DOES HELP US ADDRESS MANY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH. CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS THE STATE AND DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE GAP ANALYSIS THAT WILL BE COMPLETED AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND OUR OPPORTUNITY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO INVEST INTO PUBLIC HEALTH. I LOOK FORWARD TO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH DIFFERENTLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUITY AT ITS CORE IN THE WERE FOCUSED ON TAKING CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PENALTIES. PANEL TWO WILL FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE PROPOSAL WE WILL HAVE TEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. INCLUDING DR MARK COLLIE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY. WILL LIGHT BORN IN G. C. COOPER THE DIRECTOR AND STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR. FOR DH CS KELLY PFEIFFER DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. MERRY WATANABE WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. ELIZABETH LANDSBERG THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. DR ROSHAN FRAUD. RESEARCH NOT. OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO BE DEALING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND COREY HACIENDA AND BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. LET'S BEGIN WITH SECRETARY DR GOLLY. ALL THANK YOU AGAIN DR ARAMBULA AND- THE ENTIRE ARE- OUR GROUP- OUR OUR ENTIRE TEAM HERE JOINT JOINED US TODAY TO PRESENT HERE- IT'S REALLY A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO BE ABLE TO- KICK THIS PRESENTATION TALK ABOUT REALLY ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PANEL BECAUSE SO MANY DEPARTMENTS. ARE INTEGRATED COMING TOGETHER TO- DELIVERED THIS PROPOSAL- I AM AS I'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A PROGRAM THAT IN SO MANY WAYS IN CALIFORNIA HAS LAGGED- INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN THERE BUT NOT ALWAYS THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO SEE WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN'S AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE PROPOSAL- IN MANY WAYS REFLECTS IN MY OPINION AND I THINK MANY OF OUR OPINION. A COMMITMENT TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR TO YOUNG PEOPLE BUT WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED- DISPARITIES AND CHALLENGES ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG PEOPLE THAT EXISTED BEFORE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN WAS PART OF OUR NORMAL LEXICON. WE WERE US PROVIDERS PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN MYSELF WE WITNESSED YEARS DECADES OF INCREASING CONCERNS CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ISSUES AROUND ANXIETY DEPRESSION. INCREASED SUICIDE- AND OTHER- MOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT CHALLENGE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOUNG AS YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THOSE INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION YEAR AS AN INTEL- ADULTHOOD IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT BUDGETS ARE A TRUE MANIFESTATION OF OUR VALUES AND THE PROPOSAL. THAT WE'RE ADVANCING HERE TODAY- IS IN OUR AS COMMITMENT OF THE VALUES TO. LOOK TO LOOK AFTER YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR EMOTIONAL HEALTH. WE ARE PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON OUR GOAL ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE. CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THE DOES AND THE K. THROUGH TWELVE- BUT THOSE YOUNGEST INDIVIDUALS CHILD CARE. DOES THAT FIRST FIVE FOCUSES ON THOSE ZERO TO THREE ZERO TO FIVE YEARS THAT WE AS OUR ADVOCATES OF YOUNG PEOPLE NOW ARE SO CRITICAL. SUPPORTER OF THOSE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE WE KNOW THE STRUGGLES OF THE LAST YEAR I'VE ONLY MADE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT. DOT CONCEPT IS REALLY SEVEN PARKS- BEGINNING OUR INVESTMENTS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH VIRTUAL PORTAL THAT IS MEANT TO BE AVAILABLE STATE WIDE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. ACCESS POINT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR CRISIS BUT HOPEFULLY THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF EARLY INTERVENTIONS THE FOCUS OF THE PLATFORM IS TO IDENTIFY YOUNG PEOPLE AS EARLY ON IN THE COURSE OF SYMPTOMS IN THE COURSE OF CHALLENGES. BAD BEFORE WE SEE THE JEEP AND MANIFESTATIONS OF UNCONTROLLED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES REALLY A DOWN PAYMENT ON. DURING THAT OF DOOR IT'S AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE THAT IT'S AVAILABLE AS FAR NORTH AS SISKIYOU AND AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO AND EVERY COUNTY IN BETWEEN. THAT WE HAVE- ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS BUILDING UP OUR CAPACITY OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS OUR SCHOOLS. OUR CBO'S AND SO MANY OTHER ENTITIES THAT TOUCH THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON A DAY IN DAY UT BASIS A THIRD COMPONENT IS FOCUSED ON. DEVELOPING AND BUILDING UP THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW CAN GUIDE NOT JUST THE PLATFORM AND ALLOW YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET STEPPED UP LEVELS OF CARE ARE REALLY BE BUILT IN WHAT IS SEEN BEYOND THAT FIRST FRONT DOOR IN THE ROOMS IF YOU WILL OF THE HOUSE OF CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. THAT ARE CONNECTED THE BRICKS AND MORTAR FACILITIES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FACE TO FACE INTERVENTIONS WHERE AND WHEN THOSE VIRTUAL TO OPPOSE THOSE VIRTUAL VISITS THOSE VIRTUAL GROUPS THAT WILL BE FACILITATED THROUGH OUR STATEWIDE VIRTUAL PLATFORM OR NOT ENOUGH. WE DO NOT EXPECT OR BELIEVE THAT THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM IS THE END OF WHAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE WE SEE IT AS THAT GAVE WITH THAT FRONT DOOR BUT IF COURSE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST. IN THAT FOURTH COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH ARE THE BRICK AND MORTAR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NEEDED I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL INPATIENT BEDS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT URGENT CARE CENTERS WHICH I THINK TAYLOR WELL AND DO WELL FOR- OLDER CALIFORNIA FOR ADULTS AND IN OUR STATE. TO GET THAT CRISIS CARE THAT THEY NEED BUT BEING ABLE. TO TAKE A STATEWIDE MODEL WITH URGING KERR'S. ACROSS STATE GEN HELP ON ADULTS. MENTAL CAN BE HEALTH CHANNEL. ALSO WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE GAPS IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT SO MUCH OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE MANIFEST THEMSELVES BUT IN THOSE EARLY. YEARS IT'S SAID THAT 50% OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE DIAGNOSABLE BY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN A FULL 75% BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE BIG GAPS IN BOTH THE MENTAL SIDE BUT EVEN MORE ON THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE NOT JUST THE FACILITIES BUT THAT. THAT TAKES ME TO THE FIFTH COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS A BROAD INVESTMENT IN THE WORK FORCE. TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE- EARLY ON THOSE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES BUT ALSO BUILDING UP THE CAPACITY FOR PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY TO DO. WILL BE MORE- ARE ARE URGING CRISIS CARE IN ACUTE CARE SERVICES THIS INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM NEW CLASSIFICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACHES. WHO WORKED. IN COMMUNITIES CLOSER TO WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HELPING PROVIDE DAY IN AND DAY OUT SUPPORTS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PROFESSIONALS THAT CAN HELP SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH TELEGRAM TELEVISA IT'S AS WELL AS STAFF WAS URGENT CARE AND ACUTE CARE BEDS. THOSE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS THAT WE'VE COME TO KNOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE SPECIALIZING IN CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ARE ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL TO SIX COMPONENT IS A RECOGNITION OF THE WORK THAT PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIANS FAMILY PRACTITIONERS INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIANS. AND. OTHER PROVIDERS DO TO SUPPORT YOUNG AND CRY. WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY HOW ARE MUCH FAMILIES AN INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WANNA GET THEIR CARE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THEIR PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE THEIR FAMILY PRACTITIONERS OFFICE THERE INTERNIST IF THEY'RE OLDER- FOR VACCINATIONS FOR CO GOOD THING EVEN MORE WE SEE THOSE ACCESS POINTS. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT WE AREN'T ALWAYS AS EQUIPPED AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO PROVIDE THAT ADVICE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE SO BEING ABLE TO CREATE A STATE WIDE PLATFORM. IN E. REFERRAL ANTI COUNCIL PLATFORM AVAILABLE TO ALL OF THOSE FRONT LINE PROVIDERS TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET IMMEDIATE SUPPORT IMMEDIATE HELP STATEWIDE WITHOUT NEEDING TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AM I ALLOWED TO ASK THIS QUESTION AND GET THAT ANSWER TO DELIVER CARE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL I CAN TELL YOU COUNTLESS STORIES WHERE THAT LIFELINE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE MORE IMMEDIATE CARE MORE TIMELY CARE. TO INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS WITH QUESTIONS WITH CHALLENGES- AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE THAT I WANTED TO ELEVATE. WAS EIGHT CRITICAL PIECE TIES INTO THE LAST PRESENTATION ON PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON- THE B. R. ENGAGEMENT THE OUTRAGE THE EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE. WE KNOW THAT NORMALIZING THE- NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE THAT TARGET SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IT'S GOING TO COME NATURAL COME EASY AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT TO BUILD A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN IN. COLLABORATION WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE A KEY FEATURE. THAT CAN HAPPEN NOW THEY CAN BEGIN TO BEGIN THE- OUR- FOR EIGHT LARGER SET OF SERVICES- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. AND YOUNG ADULTS UP PROPOSAL THE LAST COMPONENT OF THIS OUR PROPOSAL IS TO BUILD IN SOME ONGOING DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND MEDICAID. DYADIC SERVICES FOCUSED ON OUR CASES WHERE CAMPAIGN AND THOSE IT BEAT OUT. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE SCREENINGS- THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN UNDER WAY ACROSS THE STATE CONTINUING RESOURCES THE BILL GOES UP I THINK- FOCUSING ON EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES. THAT KEEP THE FAMILY IN MIND KEEP THE YOUNG PERSON IN MIND- WHETHER THAT ARE LINKED TO SCHOOLS OR- REALLY BEYOND SCHOOLS AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY IS A KEY FEATURE. AND THEN LASTLY THE COMPONENT THAT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WILL BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING ACROSS THE MANY DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HERE WITH ME TODAY. TO PRESENT THEIR IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS THAT COORDINATION AND EVALUATION COMPONENT WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL IS LARGE BUT IS MATCHED. ADEQUATELY WE THANK TO THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM WE NOW THAT IT IS A COMPLEX PROPOSAL THAT BRAIDS TOGETHER INEXTRICABLE PIECES OF A PUZZLE THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE VIEW WE NEED TO ADDRESS. ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS BUT TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A DEGREE OF COORDINATION A DEGREE OF VALUATION THAT IS- THAT THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT AND A CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WORKING WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ON WITH US TODAY WILL BE PRIMARILY- IN CHARGE OF. GETTING THAT GOING OUT BEING- GROUP AND I'VE DONE A- PARTNERS OUR LOW COUNTY IS FROM OTHERS. OF HELLO- ACT- OTHER- YOU IMPORTANT- WELL VENDORS AND OTHERS ARE HOPE US DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO YOUNG PEOPLE- ARE ARE CURRENTLY EIGHT REALLY. A PROPOSAL BAD- BUILDS I THINK ON THE INNOVATIVE SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZING THE ACCELERATED OUR ISSUES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE SAW IN THE PANDEMIC AND- ADDRESSING THINGS IN THE SHORT RUN BUT REALLY LOOKING TO A SYSTEM BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THAT- TIES CLOSELY TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE TACKLING AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS PROJECT. WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS OR INCARCERATION WE KNOW SO MANY ADULTS WHO STRUGGLE IN ADULTHOOD I HAVE EARLY SIGNS EARLY MANIFESTATIONS OF THOSE CHALLENGES WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LOOK AT PEDIATRIC SAYS THE ALTERNATE FORMING ADULT PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE I THINK IS MANIFEST IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT BACK TO. YOU ALLOW THE OTHER SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL- AND I WILL APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE THAT I CANNOT- BE AVAILABLE DURING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER. PART OF THE PRESENTATION BUT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO ADDRESS MY COMMENTS OR ISSUES AT A LATER TIME AND TRUST MY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ARE MANY DEPARTMENTS WILL BE WELL EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AS THEY COME UP. THANK YOU DR GOLLY FOR YOUR TIME AND NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MATT SCHULER WHO IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE OFFICE OF. THE CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL. GOOD AFTERNOON. SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'D LIKE TO GO OVER OUR TWO COMPONENTS- THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSAL- WE HAVE- ONE COMPONENT THAT IS A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON ACES AND TOXIC STRESS AND THEN A TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING FOR EDUCATORS- WE'RE PROPOSING TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND ONE MILLION THAT TO THE TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING. SO TO START I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT BOTH OF OUR COMPONENTS AND THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE ACTUALLY NOTED AS HE NEXT STEPS TO ATTACK THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ACES AND TOXIC STRESS IN THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED AT THE END OF. TWENTY TWENTY OUR ROAD MAP FOR RESULTS. IN THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IS REALLY INTO FILAMENT OF THE SURGEON GENERAL'S CHARGE TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING AN UPSTREAM. DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT LEAD TO SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE. THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN REALLY FORMS THE BASE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. TO LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM. AND THE- AND THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WILL BE A PLAN OVER THE FLAT COMING BUDGET YEAR AND IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON THE EAST IS AWARE INITIATIVE TO TRAIN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN SCREENING AND RESPONDING. TO ACES AND TOXIC STRESS. WE REALIZE THAT. ACES AND TOXIC STRESS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC AT NATIONAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SHOWS THAT VISITS RELATED TO CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT GONNA AT THE SAME TIME REPORTS DID CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES I HAD DECREASED AND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT WERE LAID BARE BY THE PANDEMIC- NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A WAY THAT WITH ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND THIS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON ACES AND TOXIC STRESS IS ESSENTIAL IN THAT WORK. BUT FOR OUR TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING AT SIMILARLY- WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THE STRESSORS OF THE PANDEMIC BEING AWAY FROM SCHOOLS FRIENDS TEACHERS AND- AND REALLY KIND OF GOING THROUGH THE INCREASED PREVALENCE AND SEVERITY ASUS- AND WE'RE AT A CRITICAL POINT. HAS THIS FUTURE GENERATION OF CHILDREN RETURN TO SCHOOL AND NEED TO WHEN WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HAVING THE EDUCATION SECTOR TRAUMA INFORMED- IN ORDER TO AVOID A CRISIS OF PHYSICAL MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. EDUCATORS ARE IN POSITION OF PROVIDING DAILY DOSES OF STATE STABLE AND NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE HEALING. FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM TOXIC STRESS. SO THE DEPARTMENT- OUR OFFICE IS GOING TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. ARE ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO DEVELOP THIS TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING THAT WILL ALLOW EDUCATORS TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THE MAN OF THE CAKE MANIFESTATIONS OF AN OVER ACTIVE STRESS RESPONSE THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPACT LEARNING ATTENTION. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR AND ULTIMATELY- MAKE AN IMPACT ON STUDENTS ABILITY TO- HAVE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. I HAD STUDENTS THAT EXPERIENCE ACES AND TOXIC STRESS BEEN SHOWN. NOT TO DO AS WELL IN SCHOOL AND NOT TO THE TEAMS THAT THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF EDUCATION THAT THOSE ARE WHO DO NOT. EXPERIENCE IT I DO. SO EDUCATORS ARE GOING TO NEED STRATEGIES AND TOOLS TO MANAGE THEIR OWN STRESS ALSO WHEN FACING THE PROBLEM OF STUDENTS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE INCORPORATE THESE- THESE CONCEPTS WITHIN THE TRAINING THAT IS DEVELOP SO. EDUCATORS NOT ONLY HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE ADDRESS TRAUMA THAT IT'S BEEN EXPERIENCED BY THE STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN NEEDS AND TO BE ABLE TO. RESPOND. AND- WE ARE UP. WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THIS PROPOSAL BY. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PROPOSAL. I'M. IS THAT THE CONCLUSION OF YOUR TESTIMONY SIR WHAT. MY APOLOGIES- SO WE VERY MUCH ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT INVOLVES AGENCY ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO YOU- MY PUBLIC MY APOLOGIES. TAKE YOUR TIME NO STRESS. MY APOLOGIES. WE'RE HAPPY TO COME BACK TO YOU IF IT SERVES THE BETTER FOR US TO DO THAT SIR. PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH THAT WE WILL TURN TO DIRECTOR LIGHT FORM WITH DH CS. THANK YOU- CHERUB RENTAL- RIGALI- REALLY COVERED THE COMPREHENSIVE PAINFUL CHILDREN'S USE OF CONCEPT YOU KNOW VERY FEDERAL. SO ALMOST QUITE MY CELL PHONE THE SCHOOL AND- TALK PIPER PERHAPS WE CAN JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO DH YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL TURN TO DIRECTOR WATANABE WITH THE MHC. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES MA'AM. YEAH NOT AND I'LL EEP THIS BRIEF I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THE BILL DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC REPORT HOLES OR REQUEST FOR RESOURCES RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE- BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND OUR ROLE ONE THAT'S AND IT REALLY IS TO ENSURE. THAT ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL OR THROUGH SCHOOL AFFILIATED- I'M COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE CLINICS AGAIN REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE WE DON'T WANT OUR COMMERCIAL ENROLLEES TO FIND AT A CLOSED DOOR- WE ALSOWANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO CONVERT COMMERCIAL ENROLLEES. APPLAUSE STATURE CHANGES WERE OUT A NUMBER OF NEW REQUIREMENTS OF THE HEALTH PLANS. MOST NOTABLY IS THAT BEGINNING IN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE PLANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COVER BEHAVIORAL SERVICES PROVIDED AT SCHOOLS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAN HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL OR THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. IF THE SCHOOL DOES NOT PROVIDE SERVICES ON CAMPUS THIS WOULD INCLUDE SERVICES LINKED TO THE SCHOOL. SUCH AS SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. ARE WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A STREAMLINED REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS TO REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON SCHOOLS. SO WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THE HEALTH PLANS WILL REIMBURSE THE SCHOOLS- AT THE RATE OF THE CONTRACTED RATE IF THEY HAVE A CONTRACT. OR THE RATE SET BY OUR DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICARE ENROLLEES. THIS SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY FORM OF COST SHARING SUCH AS COPAYMENTS COINSURANCE OR DEDUCTIBLES AGAIN REALLY TRYING TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS. AND HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND ONLY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DENY A CLAIM IF THEY REASONABLY BELIEVE. EITHER THE STUDENT WASN'T ROLE WASN'T ENROLLED IN THE PLAN THE SERVICES WERE PERFORMED OR THERE WERE THE SERVICES WERE NOT PROVIDED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OF PERFECT PLACE PROPERLY LICENSED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE- WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS WILL NEED TO WORK THROUGH BUT- BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. INCLUDING A SPECIFIC SERVICES THE HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE AND SO IN THE COMING YEARS WE- LOOK FORWARD TO COOK CORDONING VERY CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE HEALTH PLANS DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE SCHOOLS- ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND HAPPY. TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU MAX WE'LL HEAR FROM HER LAN. DIRECT OF AUSTIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ELIZABETH PLANS FOR DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE COMPONENTS THAT AUSTIN HAS RELATED TO THE- INITIATIVE THAT SECRETARY KELLY GAVE A GAVE A THOROUGH OVERVIEW OF SO I SPENT IS LOOKING TO. USE OUR EXISTING HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS TO BUILD THE WORK FORCE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THE SIX- EXCITING AND IMPORTANT INITIATIVES OUR PEACE IS FOCUSED ON THREE GOALS INCREASING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY PROFICIENT AND CAPABLE OF PROVIDING AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. THE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES EXPANDING TRAINING FOR EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND TARGETING PROFESSIONALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO THE FIRST PIECES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO CREATE A SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH AND COUNSELOR WORKFORCE. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT COMMISSION'S RECENT REPORT OUTLINED THE NEED TO CREATE SCHOOLS AS CENTRES OF WELLNESS. THE REPORT EMPHASIZED THE UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS CREATE LEARNING BARRIERS FOR OUR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. TO ESTABLISH SCHOOLS AS CENTRES OF WELLNESS CALIFORNIA NEEDS TRAINED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AND COACHES WHO CAN PROVIDE A VARIETY OF INTERVENTIONS AND ASSIST EDUCATORS IN IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACHES AND COUNSELORS ARE ALSO VITAL TO IMPLEMENTING A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL WHERE SCHOOLS OFFER A WIDE ARRAY OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND-FAMILIES. FROM HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH TO FAMILY SUPPORTS FROM FOOD PROGRAMS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION THE CRISIS INTERVENTION AND COUNSELING. THESE COUNSELORS AND COACHES WILL HELP PROVIDE CHILDREN USE THAT CHOICE AS TO HOW WHERE AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE SERVICES INCLUDING VIRTUAL SERVICES THAT ARE SECURE. THAT PROVIDE SECURE PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY. THIS THE CHILDREN'S WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS. I THINK WE'VE REALLY SEEN- FROM TEACHING STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES AND OTHER RESILIENCY BUILDING STRATEGIES TO SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN NEED OF CLINICAL INTERVENTION SO THE PURPOSE OF THE COACHES WOULD BE TO DO THE NONCLINICAL SUPPORTS AND INTERVENTIONS AND BE TRAINED TO MAKE REFERRALS FOR CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS. THE GOAL WOULD BE TO HAVE EACH TYPE OF PROVIDER PRACTICING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LICENSE. DURING THE INITIAL YEAR OSCAR ED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS INCLUDING EDUCATION AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. EXPERTS WOULD DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO LAUNCH AND IMPLEMENT THE SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH AND COUNSELOR SYSTEM WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS THE SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING IN NEED OF CAREFUL PLANNING AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. ANOTHER PIECE OF ASHRIDGE WORK RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE THAT I WANNA HOLD UP IS THE NEED TO DEVELOP THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR SAD WORKFORCE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF SUCH COUNSELORS AND CLINICIANS AND NEEDS TO DEVELOP A SAID WORKFORCE THAT PROVIDE AGE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. IT'S CRITICAL TO BUILD THE PIPELINE OF SAID COUNSELORS AND SPECIALISTS TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO PROVIDE TREATMENT THAT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY PROFICIENT. ASHRIDGE SEEKS TO DEVELOP THE SAID WORKFORCE BY BOTH EXPANDING THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXISTING LICENSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICIANS TO PROVIDE AGE APPROPRIATE SUCH TREATMENT AS WELL AS INVESTING SUBSTANTIALLY TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT WORK FORCE AND DIVERSITY SHORTAGES. BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALS ENTERING SAID CAREERS. SO WE WOULD LOOK AGAIN TO COLLABORATE WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A NEW SAID WORKFORCE FRAMEWORK AND PLAN FOCUSED ON YOUTH AND FAMILIES. ANOTHER PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD EXPAND TRAINING CAPACITY FOR PSYCH. FOR PSYCHIATRY AND SOCIAL WORK WE KNOW THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS IN PSYCHIATRY ESPECIALLY CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. SO WE PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND GROW RESIDENTS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WERE DEVELOPED THIS MEETING WORKFORCE THAT WOULD BUILD ON OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE WET. PSYCHIATRIC EDUCATION CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM AND ADD PROGRAMS THAT TRAIN NON PRESCRIBING CLINICIANS. AND CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL WORKERS AND CHILD WELFARE WORKERS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALSO BUILD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE BUILDING ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS I'VE SPENT MANY GRANTS PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CAREER EXPLORATION. I ALSO WANT TO LET THE OTHER PIECE OF OUR PROPOSAL TO BUILD EARN AND LEARN APPRENTICESHIP MODELS. PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO JOBS CRITICAL BUT MANY CANNOT AFFORD TO PURSUE TRAINING UNLESS THEY'RE SUPPORTED WHILE DOING SO. EARN AND LEARN MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TRAINING AND PLACING INDIVIDUALS AND NEEDED OCCUPATIONS THAT WE THINK THIS CAN BE LEVERAGED SUCCESSFULLY ON THE WORK FORCE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SIDE. THESE MODELS PROVIDE TUITION SUPPORT AND ON THE JOB TRAINING AT A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER ORGANIZATION WHILE TH TRAINEES ATTEND POST SECONDARY SCHOOL OR COMPLETE TRAINING. THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES A POSITION FOR THE GRADUATE AND THERE IS A SERVICE pPROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE EMPLOYER ANSWER PER SUPERVISE AND MENTOR THE STUDENT. ASHTEAD WITH LEVERAGE THIS MODEL AND WORK WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO DEVELOP AND BUILD A PLAN TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE FOR SAID COUNCILLORS INCLUDING FOR UNLICENSED BUT TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. AREAS OF FOCUS COULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PSYCHO SOCIAL REHABILITATION SPECIALIST THAT SERVE CHILDREN YOUTH ND FAMILIES. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT WEALTH GAP ALONG RACIAL LINES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT APPROACH TO HELP DIVERSIFYING CALIFORNIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF OUR PROPOSAL HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE WANT A SPECIAL FOCUS ON TRAINING TO SERVE JUSTICE AND SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH- AS WELL AS EXPANDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DR RADHA KRISHNA OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY DEPUTY DIRECTOR CDPH. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES MY NAME IS ROSE ANOTHER KRISHNA AND I SERVED AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY OUR OFFICES VISION IS THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. TO HELP REFILL OUR VISION WE ARE GRATEFUL TO JOIN THIS CROSS DEPARTMENT PARTNERSHIP TO CHANGE THE ARC OF THE LIVES OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS. A GENERATION THAT HAS SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS TRAUMA WITH THIS PANDEMIC UPROOTING THEIR YOUTH THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING CRITICAL YEARS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT. VIEWING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY PLANS PARTICULARLY A RACIAL EQUITY LET'S WE KNOW THAT STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND SOCIAL ACCUMULATED DISADVANTAGE MEANS THAT THESE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE IN EQUITY WE BOARD. ON THE COLORS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITIES AND IN PLACES WHERE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE MORE WIDESPREAD. ANNING UP WITH A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT IS NOT IDENTIFIED OR TREATED EARLY CAN TAKE TWENTY YEARS OFF OF YOUR LIFE I'M NOT GETTING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA CAN TAKE MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS OFF YOUR LIFE. PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROUD TO JOIN THIS PARTNERSHIP. BECAUSE WE CHAMPION P. E. I. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AND NOT JUST PHYSICAL. BUT ALSO MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE. EARLIER WE CAN INTERVENE IN THE LIFE COURSE. THE LESS SUFFERING AND THE LAST COST. SO OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THIS PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION APPROACH THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT OR BUSINESS YEAR D. P. WHICH CHAMPIONS CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE AND ELEVATES INNOVATIVE. COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. THESE APPROACHES CAN HELP REACH THE UNREACHED EMPOWER THE DISENFRANCHISED TO PROMOTE WELLNESS ON THEIR TERMS WELL THIS YEAR D. B. CAN INFORM OUR COMPONENT OF THIS CAMPAIGN THIS CAMPAIGN IS VERY DISTINCT AND SEPARATE. AS A FAMILY DOCTOR FOR TEN YEARS I'VE SEEN HOW WHEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE OFFERED TO OUR YOUTH STIGMA. DISCRIMINATION CULTURAL AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS CAN GET IN THE WAY. KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS IS A START BUT WE NEED BEHAVIOR CHANGE SEEKING HELP EARLY. SO THE GOALS OF THIS PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CHANGE CAMPAIGN ARE TO RAISE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LITERACY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT MEANS ALL AGES SO THEY CAN HELP OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. THAT MEANS NORMALIZING HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT OF THAT DISTRESS IN GETTING PEOPLE TO HELP. WHEN THEY'RE READY. AND IT ULTIMATELY MEANS TACKLING DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES BY EMPOWERING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE TO ITS- WELL WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN PARTICULAR THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND THE NEW OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION WHICH WILL BE HOUSED WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE WILL FOCUS ON THREE MAIN COMPONENTS ONE AND GENERAL PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WITH THE STRONG PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MARKETING COMPONENT. TO SOCIAL SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS BUILDING ON EXISTING AND PROMISING LOCAL EFFORTS AND THREE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR SECRETARY A YOUTH EMPOWERMENT PIECE CREATING LOCAL. YOU LAD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION EFFORTS USING SOCIAL MEDIA OTHER PLATFORMS THAT ARE POSITIVE IN NATURE DESIGNED BY YOU FOR. THANK YOU I HAD TO BE A PART OF THIS PARTNERSHIP AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU DOCTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TOBY EWING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE TO BE DEALING ON BEHALF OF THAT NOW SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL- THAT SHOULD TO BE CLEAR THAT YEAH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WORKERS REFERENCE IN THE PROPOSAL BUT THERE'S NOT A COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE. THAT IS TARGETED TO THE COMMISSION. BUT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY BROAD AND IN MANY WAYS A HISTORIC PROPOSAL. THAT TOUCHES UPON THE KEY FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE KIND OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. THAT THE QUESTION HAS BEEN WORKING ON AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO ACHIEVE. WE HAVE SUCH AN AMBITIOUS EFFORT. IT HIGHLIGHTS PREVENTION. THERE'S A DISCUSSION AROUND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS LEARNING. USING INCENTIVES TO HELP TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY. GIVEN THE ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE POPULATION IT MAKES TREMENDOUS SENSE TO FOCUS ON SCHOOLS AS PARTNERS FOR LEARNING AS AS WAS MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE PRIOR COMMENTS DO OUR WORK WE RECOGNIZE THAT SCHOOLS. ARE WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE AND IT'S WHERE THERE'S OFTEN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TRUST WHICH IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT FOR FAMILIES IN TERMS. OF OUR GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS. THIS HEALTH. REGARDING OF PAYER IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WE MUST TAKE THIS IF WE'RE GOING TO AS THE PRIOR SPEAKER COMMENTED ON. REALLY LEAD WITH A POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH BECAUSE WE CAN'T IF WE SHOULD NOT BE DIFFERENTIATING BASED ON WHO THE PARENTS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW WE ACHIEVE THEM. AND VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS YEAR TO TWENTY FIVE TIMES H. SPAM. OR FOR CHILDREN YOUTH YOUNG ADULTS INTRODUCED IN EIGHT YEARS- BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT SOME VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS SOME OF WHICH ARE ADDRESSED IN IN THE PLAN AS WITH SEVERAL BASS DETAILED AND SOMEWHERE THAT THE DETAIL IS NOT QUITE THERE YET. IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO DO ROBUST PLANNING AND THE PROPOSAL TALKS ABOUT SPENDING AS MUCH AS A YEAR ON I'M PLANNING. EVENT NEEDS TO INCLUDE ROBUST ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL AGENCY PARTNERS WITH AGENCIES WILL BE DOING THE WORK. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS THE PRIOR SPEAKER COMMENTED ON WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE INTENDING TO SERVE. OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IS THE BEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE ON HOW WE SHOULD BE RESPONDING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THEMSELVES. SO THE PLANNING PROCESS NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT HELLO WE CAN BE SURE THAT THAT THE STRATEGIES AND THE TOOLS THAT ARE DEVELOPED IN THIS INITIATIVE. ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS AGAIN PEOPLE HAVE AND ARE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IS CHALLENGING. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LESSONS LEARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR SOME PUBLIC SECTOR EXAMPLES. FIRST IT'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH VERY CLEAR GOALS. AND THOSE GOALS NEED TO BE SHARED BY A BROAD SET OF STAKEHOLDERS INTERNAL TO THE PROJECT AND ALSO EXTERNAL TO THE PROJECTS SUCH AS THE LEGISLATURE. I'M SUCH AS THE COUNTIES ARE OUR LOCAL EDUCATION PARTNERS YOUNG PEOPLE THEMSELVES BECAUSE NEED TO BE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND. YOU ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO HELPING US REACH SUCCESS. IN THAT PROCESS AND SO THOSE CALLS NEED TO BE. DEVELOPED THROUGH A CONSULTATION PROCESS. WHAT DOES GOALS IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE AND MONITOR PROGRESS THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS EARLIER AMONG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO. HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION ON THINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE SERVING. AT DECLINES IN THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES AT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE THAT IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE YEARS AND IS IT AS IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. ROSS THE BOARD I THINK CALIFORNIA IS ARE FARTHER ALONG IN MANY AREAS THAN OTHER STATES ARE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO IMPROVE HOW WE DO THAT. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THOSE GOALS SUCH AS SERVING MORE CHILDREN REDUCING EXPULSIONS REDUCING CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT REDUCING SUICIDE BUT ALSO POSITIVE THINGS LIKE IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN TRANSLATE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AROUND THOSE GOALS TO GIVE US REAL TIME INFORMATION. MANY TIMES I WOULD ADD IT LARGE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THEM THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE ESTABLISHED WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE UNITS THAT ARE REALLY DESIGN. INDEPENDENT OF THE CHANGE PROCESS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REALLY MONITOR WHAT'S HAPPENING THROUGH THE CHANGE PROCESS AND TO EQUIP ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THOSE WHO ARE INTERNAL TO THE PROCESS IN GETTING THE WORK DONE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE EXTERNAL. WELL AS PARTNERS BUT ALSO AS AS THE SORT OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE OF THIS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION FROM TRUSTED RESPECTED SOURCES. SO THAT THEY CAN CREATE CONFIDENCE THAT THE WORK IS BEING DONE IN WAYS THAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT INFORMATION BEGINS TO CHANGE COLORS WHEN CHANGING COURSE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BASED ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. ALONG THE WAY. THIS OF THIS. REQUIRES VERY BROAD PARTNERSHIPS WITH ALL OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES WHO ARE ENGAGED WITH THIS AGE SPAN AND THE KINDS OF SERVICES. MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO PUT OUT THERE THANKS SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BUT OUR HOSPITALS OUR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR AS KEY PARTNERS IN DELIVERING CARE PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF NEED. CERTAINLY OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR COUNTIES AND OTHERS AND I APPRECIATE THE SECRETARY COMMENTED ABOUT FIRST FIVE IN OTHER PARTNERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OTHER POINTS THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK A ONE TIME FUNDING AS THE RIGHT KIND OF A CATALYST. TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED. AND THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST QUITE OFTEN AND WE HAVE GIVEN GRANTS TO LOCAL PARTNER SCHOOLS ARE COUNTIES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME THEY'VE STOOD UP NEW PROGRAMS BUT WE'VE NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND CAPACITY BUILDING SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO TURN ONE TIME FUNDING INTO SYSTEMS CHANGE THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED WITH LONG TERM FINANCIAL SUPPORT SO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM ADDRESS A LOT NOT BE ABOUT ENGAGING OUR OUR OUR REP HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CAN BUILD OUT THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE FINANCING STRATEGY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THAT IN A WAY. THAT HAS THESE FUNDS. ARE STEP BACK THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE TO CONTINUE TO SCALE THE STRATEGY WITH SUSTAINABLE FINANCES OVER TIME. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE STATE HAS THE FOUNDATION THAT MANY OF THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PROPOSAL- SHOULD BUILD UPON AND SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT AND COMMENTED ON THIS- IN EARLIER. TESTIMONY TO THE COMMITTEE NO MENTION IN THE NEXT ITEM THAT THE COMMISSION HAS SOME SOME COMMENTS ON WE'VE INVESTED OVER NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD OUT EIGHTEEN SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO GROW THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE SCHOOLS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YEAH WE'RE GIVING THEM A SINGLE UNIFIED OUR INTEGRATED STRATEGY RATHER THAN ASKING SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE AS PARTNERS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SEPARATELY WITH OTHER POTENTIAL PAYERS. THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE IS BUILDING UPON WHAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE TO THE EXTENT THAT WHAT'S IN PLACE IS APPROPRIATE. AND. IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THE EN ROUTE. WHAT'S PLACE WITH A NEW. MORE IN A- AND- DESIGN. TEMAS THE PROPOSAL OUT THE NEED TO HIGHLIGHT EVIDENCE. AS TO THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES COMPONENT TO IT CALLED OUT ATTENTION ON EARLY CYCLE SINCE. I WITH SUPPORT FROM THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE FOURTEEN COUNTIES WITH FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT TO BUILD A LEARNING COMMUNITY WE ASK THAT THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. ON THE WEST COAST AT UC DAVIS UC S. S. UCLA AND STANFORD AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A FOUNDATION HERE THAT THIS PROPOSAL CAN BUILD UPON. SIMILARLY THEY USE DROPPED AN EMPHASIS WE AGREED THAT YOU'RE STRAPPING SERVICES THREE CENTRAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE IN THE TRANSITION AND USE TIME FRAME OR H. AGE RANGE. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT DOWN JUNE TWENTY FIFTH SANTA CLARA COUNTY WITH OUR SUPPORT IN SUPPORT FROM STANFORD WILL BE LAUNCHING THE FIRST YEAR ALTHOUGH DROP IN CENTER. SO I'M VERY IMPORTANT TO MODEL HOW WE- STARTED TO BUILD UPON THE MODELS. THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. SO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT ELSE CONCERNED THAT MANY OF THESE. ARE ARE IN THE OUT YEARS BECAUSE OF THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF THAT LONG RANGE PLANNING. THAT IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW FOR US WE WANT TO WORK WITH DH CS IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IN THE WORK AS ENVISIONED THIS PROPOSAL TO BUILD OFF OF THIS FOUNDATION. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO SOME THINGS. TOMORROW BECAUSE WE HAVE AS AS SECRETARY GOLLY MENTION- TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN OPENING SCHOOLS OPENING OUR ECONOMY AND- IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH BEHAVIOR HOUSE GRAINS. THEY BRING CARE. TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THROUGH SCHOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AT THE MOMENT. WE ALSO I CAN I KNOW THE SECRETARY MENTIONED IN HIS COMMENTS ON THAT WE DIDN'T SEE AN ORIGINAL PLAN. I'M VERY IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH CHILDREN. ZERO TO FIVE AGE RANGE. MARTIN TO WORK WITH. OLDER THE TRADITION YET BUT WITH OUR EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CALIFORNIA ARE POISED TO STRENGTHEN HOW THEY RESPOND TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND WE'D IT MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE PARTICULAR PARTNERS MAY NEED SOME SPECIFIC AND SPECIAL ATTENTION IN THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE LAID OUT IN THIS INITIATIVE RECOGNIZING THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE EXISTING SEGMENTS TO REALLY DIRECT SERVICES TO A LARGE PORTION OF. STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THOSE AGE RANGES- AND I AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON A DIGITAL STRATEGY. AND WE HAVE SEEN BECAUSE OF COLD ED AND ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN ST MARSHALL'S RECENTLY RECOGNIZING THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD IS REALLY SHIFTING TO DIGITAL MENTAL HEALTH. MOST OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN PAY A MONTHLY KIND OF SUBSCRIPTION AND SO WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN EMBRACE DIGITAL STRATEGIES. WE'D LIKE TO SEE DIGITAL STRATEGIES BE PAIRED WITH MOBILE STRATEGIES AS MORE FEDERAL SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES MOBILE CAN ACTUALLY COMPLIMENTS DIGITAL. IN WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE RATHER THAN AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AT OUR DOORSTEP. WHEN THEY ARE AT THE HIGHEST POINT OF CRISIS OR NEEDING INFORMATION TO DO THIS WORK IN REAL TIME DIGITAL AND MOBILE NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND. OUR CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND TO ACCESS AND IT DOESN'T IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN LED BY PREVENTION OF THE COMMISSION IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE MESSAGING IN THIS PLAN THE OPPORTUNITY THIS PLAN REPRESENTS. A WE WOULD VERY MUCH WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AS ARE STARTING TO ROLL THIS OUT IF THIS WERE TO MOVE FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP STRENGTHEN THE STRATEGY. AND PLAY OUR ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONSE THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AS BEST AS WE CAN IN. FACT HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FOR CORE HARSH DOLLAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA A KOREA SHEET WITH THE L. A. L- I'LL BE DELIVERING ALL OF OUR OUR OFFICES COMMENTS ON ON- THE INITIATIVE TODAY I THINK MY COLLEAGUE BEN JOHNSON IS ON THE ON THE AGENDA BUT I THINK HE HAD PREPARED HIS COMMENTS FOR SORT OF A LATER A LATER PANEL- WELL WE'VE CONDUCTED OUR INITIAL REVIEW OF THIS INITIATIVE AND YOU HAVE SOME CONSIDERATIONS TO RAISE. YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO THIS INITIATIVE CUTTING ACROSS. MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS- INCLUDING YOU KNOW ALL OF THE PANELISTS TODAY- SO MY COMMENTS WILL BE OVER ARCHING IN NATURE FOCUSED ON THE INITIATIVE AS A WHOLE- FIRST WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- ACROSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE THE LEGISLATURE. IS GOING TO NEED FURTHER DETAIL ON A LOT OF AREAS IN ORDER TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF EACH PROPOSAL- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE TRAILER BILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE INITIATIVE- WHICH MAY ANSWER SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS BUT- THAT TRAILER BILL AGAIN IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR- LEGISLATIVE REVIEW AT THIS TIME- BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE INITIATIVE. WE FIND THAT IN GENERAL WHILE THERE ARE RELATIVELY SMALLER PORTIONS OF THE INITIATIVE THAT RELATE TO THE ONGOING PROVISION OF SERVICES- SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF A NEW BENEFIT IN MEDIC CALIFORNIA. CARE SPENDING UNDER THE INITIATIVE WOULD LARGELY BE FOCUSED ON ONE TIME INVESTMENTS FOR CAPACITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR EXAMPLE THE CREATION OF THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM THAT WAS DISCUSSED TODAY- THESE ONE TIME FOR. THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO OVERHAUL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY HAVE MERIT. BUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS A RESULT OF THESE INVESTMENTS. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE REALIZED UNTIL SOME YEARS INTO THE FUTURE- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO PRIORITIZE- GETTING SERVICES OUT TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GIVEN URGENT NEED- WE JUST KNOW THAT THIS TRADE OFF EXISTS BETWEEN PRIORITIZING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. AND SERVICES NOW- NEXT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE RELATIVELY SMALLER COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE THAT- DO YOU PROVIDE A FISCAL ESTIMATE OF ONGOING SERVICE COSTS. IN GENERAL THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SCORE ON GOING COSTS THAT MAY ARISE FROM- THE GREATER CAPACITY FOR SERVICES THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY RESULT FROM THE MAJOR ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF THE INITIATIVE- THERE'S ALSO A- COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WHICH WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER TO REQUIRE. COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE PLANS TO COVER- SERVICES IN SCHOOLS YOU KNOW WE FIND IT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD HAVE A FISCAL ATTACHED TO IT WHICH IS NOT SORT OF SCORED AT THIS TIME- NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT A- SIZABLE PORTION OF THE INITIATIVE. IS PROPOSED TO BE PROVIDED AS GRANT FUNDING TO A VARIETY OF ENTITIES- THESE COULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SCHOOLS COUNTIES- UNIVERSITIES HEALTH PLANS- GIVEN THE MANY DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR GRANT FUNDS. YOU KNOW WE FIND THE KEY DETAILS RELATED TO HOW THESE GRANT PROGRAMS WOULD BE DESIGNED ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE REQUIRED BENCHMARKS ARE METRICS APPLICANTS WOULD HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FUNDS. NEED TO SORT OF BE CLEARLY FLESHED OUT- GIVEN THATTHESE ENTITIES MAY SORT OF HAVE DIFFERENT CAPACITY- FOR MEETING SORT OF A STANDARD SET OF PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS- WE WOULD ALSO JUST FLAG THAT- SIZABLE PORTIONS OF THE INITIATIVE ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE. SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH REGARDLESS OF PAYER- SORT OF BEYOND THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT ON THE STATE TRADITIONALLY HAD MORE RESPONSIBILITY OVER OVERSEEING- YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THE PANELISTS- BEFORE ME SPOKE ON SORT OF THE MERITS OF THAT APPROACH. YOU KNOW WE DON'T SORT OF RAISING MAJOR ISSUES WITH THAT BUT WE JUST WE DO JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION- SO THAT IT MAY CONSIDER TO WHAT EXTENT IT AGREES WITH THAT APPROACH FOR- IF IT WOULD WISH TO SORT OF TARGET MORE FUNDING OUGHT. TO USE ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS I'M SUCH AS MEDICAID I'LL- LASTLY GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THIS INITIATIVE AND WE FIND THAT FLUSHING OUT THE EVALUATION COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE IS GOING TO BE VITAL- TO SORT OF ENSURE THAT DEMONSTRATED MEASURABLE OUTCOMES ARE STILL STAR- ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF THESE PROPOSALS- PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS- THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONS. IN ITS INITIATIVE DOCUMENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL A COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT- THE INITIATIVE WILL SORT OF HAVE MORE FOCUSED. EVALUATION COMPONENTS IN EACH OF THE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THAT THE INITIATIVE- BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL THE DETAIL THAT WE'RE AWARE OF ON ON THIS FRONT AND- SO WE JUST SORT OF NOTE THAT- REALLY SORT OF UNDERSTANDING CLEARLY WHAT. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK IS GOING TO BE IN PLACE JUST TO SORT OF MAKE SURE THE STATE HAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT'S GETTING AS A RESULT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OFFICES OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AT THIS TIME- AGAIN THIS IS. BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE REYES- IN THE FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT COMPLETES THIS PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND I'M JUST JUST SOME QUESTIONS HERE AND I'LL START WITH A COP COUPLE COMMENTS ON EARLY ON I KNOW DOCTOR GOLLY HAD HAD HAD OTHER BUSINESS BUT REALLY ON- DR GOLLY LINK TO- BEHAVIORAL. WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER- IF SOME OF THOSE CONDITIONS AREN'T EARLY ADDRESSED EARLY I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT ALSO COULD THE COMBINATION THOSE TO THINK COULD LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS FOR THIS POPULATION AS WELL- AND- SO PART OF MY- QUESTION TO PEOPLE OUT THERE- WHOEVER MIGHT ADDRESSES. IS THAT- I GUESS IN GENERAL WHAT KIND OF AN OVER ARCHING THEME FOR ME AND I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT I TALKED ABOUT MONDAY MORNING AT EIGHT THIRTY- WHEN THERE WASN'T ANYBODY HERE EXCEPT FOR US- IN AND THAT IS- JUST IN GENERAL THE OVER ARCHING THEME- CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT. WHO WHO OR WHAT GROUP OF PEOPLE IS ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE OVERSIGHT OTHER THAN THE LEGISLATURE. FOR THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE- IS THERE SOMEONE WHO IS THE YOU KNOW GOING TO BE IN LOOKING AT ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND ALL OF THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TO SEE ARE WE SPENDING THE MONEY AND GETTING THE RESULTS WE WANT THAT'S CALLED ACCOUNTABILITY- IN OUR THAT IS OUR DATA COLLECTION SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK PROGRAM OUTCOMES. SO WHO IS THE ACT WHEN I VISIT WHAT I'M VISUALIZING HERE IS LIKE A BUSY AIRPORT A LOT OF PLANES COMING AND GOING BUT NO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. IN THAT'S THAT TROUBLES THAT TROUBLES ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS WITH FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PLEASE DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND WE NEED TO SPEND THESE RESOURCES WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO INVEST IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR OLD PEOPLE AND EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN IT'S A HUGE HUGE ISSUE. BUT WHAT I DON'T SEE. IS A COORDINATION OF EFFORT AND WHEN I WORRY ABOUT. IS THAT THE MONEY GOES INTO SILOS. AND THE SILOS DON'T TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE DUPLICATION THEY MIGHT BE OVERLAP AND WE MIGHT NOT GET THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND SO AS I MAKING NOTES HERE LISTENING TO PEOPLE I WANT TO. COMP THAT COMMENT THAT- MISTER EWING BROUGHT UP. SOME OF THESE THINGS. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH GOALS. WE NEED TO MEASURE AND MONITOR PROGRESS. WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION ACROSS HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL WE DON'T HAVE IT. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE NEED TO USE THAT INFORMATION AND BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE CHANGED COURSE CHANGES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T OFTEN DO- AND THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE OUTCOMES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING THE MONEY ON IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY. SO CAN I KNOW SOMEBODY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE ANSWER WHO IS GOING TO BE THE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF ALL OF THESE EFFORTS. SO THERE THERE IS A PERSON OR ENTITY THAT WE CAN GO TO AND GET. REAL TIME INFORMATION. HAZ I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO STEP IN GIVEN THAT DR KELLY HAD TO STEP AWAY FOR A MOMENT AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WAS MENTIONED IN HIS OVER YOU WHAT'S REALLY THE BALL THAT AGENCY WILL BE PLAYING IN REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY WILL NOT ONLY BE LEADING A CROSS DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION AS HE REFERENCED A BUT THEY ALSO PLAN ON CONVENING AND ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING A YOUTH FOCUSED ENGAGEMENT BURKE HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE DECISIONS ARE BEING PULLED ACROSS THESE VARIOUS INVESTMENTS. ARE YOU CAN SEE WITHIN THE PROPOSAL THERE ARE KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE ONGOING THE BIRCH WALL THAT DIRECT SERVICES THROUGH THE VIRTUAL POPCORN THE ECON SALT ON THE LINKAGE WITH SCHOOL- SERVICES IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BUT A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS IN THESE FIRST FEW YEARS WILL BE REALLY BUILDING THAT FOUNDATION FOR THOSE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND WHAT WORKING ACROSS- AS WELL AS HOW THAT PLAYS INTO THE LONG TERM KIND OF INVESTMENTS FOR THAT PROGRAM AND SO. I THINK THERE IS- MANY PLANS TO HAVE A LARGE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WOULD BE INFORMING ON THAT WORK WE WOULD HAVE THE- THE A PROPOSAL FOR WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT A BEHAVIOR HEALTH THINK TANK WHICH WOULD HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON THAT WOULD HELP INFORM BEST PRACTICES LEAKAGES HOW WE SHOULD BE BUILDING OFF OF THESE THINGS TO BE AS EFFECTIVE. AS POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE I'M IN TO REALLY DO IT RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY A REALLY DEVALUATION COMPONENTS STARTING EARLY IT'S WHY EVEN- BRING ON THE EVALUATORS IN YOUR WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE EVALUATION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAM WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT ARE THE METRICS WE WOULD LIKE TO YOU- TO TRACK INTO OVERSEE AS WE BUILD THIS PROGRAM OVER MANY MANY YEARS AND SO I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS BEING LED BY AGENCY THE STAKEHOLDER. GROUP THAT WILL INFORM MUCH OF THIS BEHAVIOR HEALTH THINK TANK AND THE EVALUATION ON THAT THE AGENCY WOULD BE PUTTING PARK ARE ALL MANY COMPONENTS. THAT WOULD ADDRESS ON WHAT YOU'RE RAISING. IT AND THOSE AROUND. BUT THERE WAS WORK ALL COME BUT IS THERE SO IS HEARING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. ABOUT THEIR I MEAN IS THERE SOMEBODY ULTIMATELY WHO'S GOING IS IT IS IT IS IT DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN IS IT I MEAN WHO WHO IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND IS THAT IN IN NOT JUST AN EMPLOYEE'S I'M RYING TO BE KANNST CONSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE I REALLY DO WANNA I REALLY DO WANT TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE ISSUE HERE. IS THAT. YOU KNOW CAN WE TAKE THAT. THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THESE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND GET THEM WITH THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE WITH ALL THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER ISSUES. AND GET THEM TOGETHER WITH THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND LINK THESE THINGS TOGETHER. FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL SILOS. AND REALLY GET TO THE MEAT OF THE ISSUE FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS NOW THERE'S OTHER CAUSES FOR HOMELESSNESS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER REASONS HERE. BUT THE ACE OF HOMELESSNESS THAT WE SEE AS WE WALKED THE STREETS. I BEG TO ARGUE THAT MUCH OF THAT IS POTENTIALLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER COMBINATIONS OF THAT. BUT YOU KNOW. THESE ARE ALL COMPLICATED THINGS AND YOU KNOW FEELS LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE- THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ALL TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER TO COORDINATE THESE EFFORTS. AND THAT'S WHAT I DON'T SEE. I SEE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT I DO I AGREE WE SHOULD SPEND BUT I DON'T SEE THE COURT I DON'T SEE ANY OVER ARCHING COORDINATION. IT GIVES. THE GIVES US. HOPEFULLY THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. MAY DOCTOR WHAT OLD WILL LIKE FOR PARK WELL I THINK IT'S A IT'S A FUNCTION THAT HAS TO BE SOMEWHAT WITH AGENCY BECAUSE YOU HAVE BOTH DAMAGE SEE ALL WITH THE PRIVATE PLANS AND THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME DELIVERY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU HAVE. ALSO THE H. CS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS. WELL AND- LOCAL ARE RESPONSE. IS SOLD SO DISORDER AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL. REPORTING ON THE PHONE THE ONLY THING I TRUST I MADE UP- DOLLARS AND EFFECTIVENESS SO I THINK OF IT. YOU HAVE THESE COUPLE OF DEPARTMENTS BUT INITIATIVE OF THE SCALE ALL CLEARLY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SECRETARY IS A CENTRAL AVENUE TWICE. HE PRESENTED IT TO ME. SO THAT WE SHOULD. REPORT WHERE Q. EXILE ABOUT THIS ALL MICHIGAN VERY COME TO IT- BUT IT I THINK WE ALL THAT THERE ARE. OF EACH CHAPTER ALL AND THEN A LITTLE BIT AS A WHOLE- OF THIS AND HIS ME STAFF. OR WILL. BEAGLE STORES HELLO WORK HITTING OUR TARGETS OF NOT. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE THING YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN OUR B. C. P. IS ACTUALLY REQUESTING A DEPUTY LEVEL INDIVIDUAL TO LEAD THIS INITIATIVE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT CROSSES OVER THE MULTIPLE PAIRS AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE BURKE WILL PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT. WHICH INCLUDES THE DIRECT SERVICES THE LINKAGES TO THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- DOCTOR WOULD AND WOULD BE A FUNCTION THROUGH THAT PLATFORM AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL TEAM ON THAT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON CONNECTING THOSE TALKS WORKING VERY CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE WHO WOULD BE LEADING THE- MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR ON. THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME HIGHER LETTER LEADERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THOSE DOTS ARE BEING CONNECTED NECKING TO ALL OF THOSE VOCAL ON TEACHERS AS WELL AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST LOST WITHIN OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS BUT THERE'S A CONCERTED TEAM TO KIND OF LEAD THIS EFFORT IN THE IN A VERY CLEAR WAY TO SPELL. IT WOULD JUST NOTE YOU KNOW WHEN WE USE THE TERM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IT IS ENCOMPASSED OF BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND SO THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL IS. INCLUSIVE OF BOTH OF US. WE CAN'T PREDICT IT THAT WAY. THAT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME BECAUSE I'LL WHAT I WAS SEEING WAS. A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO A LOT OF PROGRAMS AND I DIDN'T FEEL I DON'T I DIDN'T FEEL COORDINATION THERE'S OF NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEPUTY LEVEL. PERSON WHO'S GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE THAT THAT'S HELPFUL THAT'S HELPFUL TO ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT. BECAUSE WITH WITH WITH WITH SOMEBODY WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED TO NOW WE'RE GETTING THE RESULTS. HERE AND NOT JUST. PUTTING MORE MONEY IN SILOS THAT ARE WORKING INDEPENDENTLY- AS WE SEE IN A LOT OF PARTS A GOVERNMENT QUITE FRANKLY AND- AND WE'VE WE'VE HEARD WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM- WITH FOR THAT. ALL ALONG ALL ALONG THE WAY HERE SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. IF I MAY MISTER SEVEN NUMBER- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL AT TOUCHES BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES I SHOULD SAY OF THAT COMPANY SERVICES AGENCY WITH EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT HOUSING. IS IT ISN'T IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS AN INTERNAL TEAM THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT AS YOU SAY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER GUIDANCE AT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF THE ADMINISTRATION- BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT TO BRINGIN THE COUNTY TO BRING IN LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THE LOCAL PARTNERS ON WHOM WE DEPEND. FOR THIS AFTER BE SUCCESSFUL AND I WOULD ADD EVEN THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT IT IT IS THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER BUT IT'S ALSO THE INFORMATION THAT EXTERNAL PARTNERS NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT YOU EXPECT THAT THE PUBLIC EXPECTS AND THAT WE CAN REMOVE BARRIERS WHEN THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED IN THE PROCESS AND SO THAT THAT EMPHASIS ON OUTCOMES AND GOALS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO CAN TO SUSTAIN THE CONFIDENCE THAT OFTEN STARTS AT THE BEGINNING OF A PROJECT. THAT CAN WANE WHEN YOU CONFRONT SOME CHALLENGES GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE YOU MENTIONED HOUSING WE WOULD AGREE HOUSING IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU MAY ALSO THINK ABOUT AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES SPECIFIC TO THIS PROJECT THAT IS THAT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT INCLUDES ALL OF. THE PARTNERS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS. THANK YOU AND I GESS I BACK TO THE HOUSING BECAUSE- I JUST I JUST FEEL YOU CAN'T JUST. YOU CAN'T JUST THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT JUST CAN'T JUST BE TAKEN AND PUT AN INPUT INTO HOUSING. AND EXPECT THAT THAT YOU'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR THEM THAT'S NOT REALISTIC IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE REAL WORLD YOU DON'T ADDRESS THESE OTHER ISSUES. THAT HAVE LED TO THEIR THEIR HOMELESSNESS- YOU'RE JUST ET YOUR DATE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND IF YOU'RE HEARING FRUSTRATION FROM ME IT'S BECAUSE- EVERYWHERE I GO IN MY DISTRICT. HOW HOMELESSNESS- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT THAT YOU WITH THEIR MANIFESTED IN PEOPLE ON THE STREET ARE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES AND WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. AND I JUST WANT TO BE SURE IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT A TON OF MONEY AND ALL THIS WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. DO WE HAVE DATA TO TRACK OUTCOMES AND WE HAVE RESULTS AND COORDINATED EFFORT A REALLY COORDINATED EFFORT AND IT JUST FEELS LIKE THE COORDINATION PART IS WHAT'S MISSING. AND AND I AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET BEYOND THAT QUITE FRANKLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS. AND THANK YOU FOR- BRINGING FORWARD- THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH INITIATIVE I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT WE START TO FOCUS ON. THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YOUTH. POPULATION AND TALKING ABOUT ARE HOMELESS YOUTH THAT ARE OUT. OF THERE IN THE STREETS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO. NOW LOOK AT- BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE FOR THEM. WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE ESTABLISH THE HOMELESS. YOUTH TASK FORCE. AND WE FOUND QUICKLY. THAT THERE IS RESISTANCE TO DIFFERENT BEDS- DIFFERENT. UNITS DIFFERENT INSTRUCTION OF THOSE BEING DONE THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT CITIES YET. THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE BECAME IT WAS A NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE CITIES. SO BEING ABLE TO SEE NOW MOVING FORWARD. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS. PROPOSAL SHOWS THAT NOW. WE COULD- START TO FULLY ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS. IN THE YOUTH AND THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL THOSE ISSUES. THAT WE NEED TO BUT THERE HAS TO BE. AN AREA WHERE ALL THIS INFORMATION IS COMING INTO SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION AND REALLY. DECIPHER IT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SENDING RESOURCES TO THOSE AREAS. AND THE PROGRAMS THAT TRULY ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL AND THAT'S ONE OF THE HOPES OF. MOVING FORWARD WITH THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THAT WOULD BE THAT CATCH ALL OF ALL THAT DATA. COMING THROUGH- AND SO I JUST WANTED TO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR ONE. IS WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ON THE PRESENTATION. THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE WORKING WITH- THE LOCAL ALLEY AS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION. ON EQUIPPING TEACHERS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE DIFFERENT- TRAITS THAT COULD BE COMING FOR WITH MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS. IN AUTUMN AND ALL ALSO A SUICIDE PREVENTION. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT PARENTS PARENTS TODAY IN THIS DAY AND AGE STILL NEED THOSE RESOURCES ALSO. TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN OR THE GUARDIANS OF THE CHILDREN SO THEY CAN BECOME THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. SO THOSE ARE ALSO- TALK ABOUT INCLUDING THEM IN THE WHOLE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS OF INCLUDING THEM IN THAT DISCUSSION. SO I'LL STEP IN AND THEN A PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ALSO ADD ANYTHING IN REGARDS TO THAT THE CAMPAIGN THAT THEY WOULD BE- COORDINATING ARE THERE VERY MUCH IS GOING TO BE A FOCUS AND ENSURE THAT THEIR YOUTH WITHIN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WILL BE CONVENIENT- TO INFORM THIS WORK AND I WOULD. ASSUME THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE FAMILIES AND OR- CARE GIVERS OF ABUSE I TO ALSO INFORM THE WORK FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. I'M SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES- AND DON'T KNOW IF THE IF ANY OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES WANT TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL- COMPONENTS OF THE OVERALL KIND OF CAMPAIGN THAT THEY WOULD BE. RUNNING THANK YOU J. C. I CAN JUST ADD THAT BESIDES THE EDUCATION SECTOR. FAMILIES CAREGIVERS AND OTHER INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ADULTS THAT PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN KIDS LIVES IS A KEY PART OF THE CAMPAIGN FROM FOSTER YOUTH TO TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH TO OTHERS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE SCHOOL AND NOT ALWAYS THE PARENTS LET ME CREATE THE TOUCH POINTS SO INTENTIONALLY. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CHANGE CAMPAIGN WILL BE BROUGHT IN NATURE TO TRY AND HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS JUST LIKE WITH STROKE OR SOMETHING ELSE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY EARLY SIGNS TO INTERVENE FOR ANY. YOU MAY NOT HAVE IF YOU SEE OUR YOUTH THAT THAT YOU HAVE THAT CONNECTION WITH AND THAT THEY'RE IN DISTRESS THAT YOU KNOW THOSE SIGNS AND YOU KNOW HOW TO SUPPORT THEM AND GETTING LINKED. THANK YOU AND JUST EXPANDING UPON THAT IS- UTILIZING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY BUILT WITH A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- YOUTH TASTE CENTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT YOUTH GROUPS THAT ARE THERE T WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER WITH A PRISONER I BELIEVE THAT TALKED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHILDREN HOSPITALS. THAT ARE ALREADY IN MANY OF THE PARTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND BEING PART OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THERE THAT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO EQUIP THEM TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- WITH ARE YOU. THERE ARE THEY ALSO PART OF THE COMPONENT OF HOW WE'RE REACHING OUT SO THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING OR TRYING TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT PROBABLY EXISTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IF THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AT ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES OR HAVE. THOSE THAT DRASTICALLY WE NEED THE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY COULD THEN GET THE RESOURCES IN A TIMELY MANNER. JUST OVERALL ALL COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I MEAN I THINK. IT'S DEFINITELY THE EXPLICIT INTENTION. TO SORT OF. PULLING TOGETHER ALL OF THE ALL. LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE PRESENCE FOOTPRINT AND IMPACT OF THE SPACE. THAT WE DO BUILT ON WHAT EXISTS ALL THE- HOSPITALS CLINICS SYSTEMS LIKE THAT WELL PART OF THE SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY AS WE SORT OF DEVELOPED PLATFORMS RENDON OUR NEXT AGENDA. AREA WILL BILL SOME ABOUT TWELVE TO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS WELL ALL OF THESE ALL NEED TO BE KEPT VERY EFFECTIVELY. RANKED AND COMMUNICATED ACROSS. THANK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO ANSWER FURTHER MORE ON THAT QUESTION. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON- YOU KNOW WORKING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WORKING ON CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS FOR- OLDER. ADULT POPULATION IN SEEN NOW THAT THE PROMISE OF NOW FOCUSING ON YOUTH- AND- AND CRISIS STABILIZATION PSYCHIATRIC THOSE TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR YOU FOR NOW- BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR SO LONG. SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT THIS PROPOSALS COMING FORWARD. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO- A. B. AND BE ASSURED THAT THE REQUEST IN THIS PROPOSAL IN THE FUNDING. WOULD START TO GO TOWARDS CREATING FOR ARE YOU RIGHT ARE ARE K. THROUGH ALL THE WAY UP TO THE- TWENTY FIVE AGE I BELIEVE IT WAS. THAT A PRESENTER SAID THEY WILL START TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF STABILIZATION- UNITS. OR STE THIS CRISIS CENTERS IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THROUGHOUT HE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- INFRASTRUCTURAL NEEDS THAT ARE THERE. WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS FOR OUR OLDER POPULATION AS FAR AS CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS AND NOW. WE'RE A BIG PROPONENT OF CREATING LONG TERM AND IT IS STABILIZATION UNITS FOR NINETY DAYS PLUS. BUT YET WE'RE TAX LEVY HERE AT THE OLDER AGES WHAT AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE NOW THAT WOULD BRING THE FOCUS TO OUR YOUNGER AGES. WHAT THEY'RE INGESTING NEED OF THE SAME RESOURCES RIGHT AT EARLY AGE SO WANTING TO ASK. IN THE FUNDING SCHEME IS BEING PRESENTED WITH THIS ALSO IDENTIFIED THE NEED. FOR A CRISIS- STABILIZATION SERVICES OR THINGS OF THAT TYPE- TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT MORE COUNTIES MORE AREAS WOULD HAVE THOSE RESOURCES READILY AVAILABLE FOR USE. ESPECIALLY. COMING OUT OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN. THAT RESPOND. ALL THE PROPOSAL ACTUALLY LINKS SHOULD BE SO AS LINKED BOTH TO ALL COVERS BUDGET JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR THE INCENTIVE- BUILDING UP CONNECTIONS BETWEEN- MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS BUT ALSO LINKED TO THE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE- INVESTMENT STUFF ON OUR COULD BE DISCUSSED IN OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DH CS BUDGET BECAUSE OUR SPECIFIC RESOURCES- DEDICATED THEIR TO THE ALL WITH ALL SOCIAL CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ALL OF ALL. YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. AND I WOULD ADD THAT- WITH THE THIS BILL THERE'S TWO FIFTY FIVE ON MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED- ON TO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES JUST MAKE SURE IT'S SPECIFICALLY CARVED OUT- AS WELL MENTIONED KIND OF BUILDING OFF OF THAT PROPOSAL PREVIOUSLY AND IT WOULD INCLUDE ANYWHERE FROM ACUTE INPATIENT- RESIDENTIAL FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS WELL AS- BUT- YOU KNOW. TO CALLING BEHAVIOR HEALTH URGENT CARE AS WELL AS BEHAVIOR HEALTH WELLNESS CENTRES THE FALL CONTINUE ON FOR CHILDREN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE- VARIOUS TOUCH POINTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE RETURNS WHERE- IN INPATIENT OR RESIDENTIAL SETTING MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR A CHILD OR YOUTH. I'M INDIVIDUAL BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE FULL CONTINUUM AND HOME LIKE SERVICES ON THAT THEY CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE AND- AND SO IT WOULD INCLUDE THE FULL SPECTRUM OF SERVICES FOR- THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND. I HAVE ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. BRING IN THIS- THESE ISSUES FOR SO THAT WE CAN ALL START TO- ADVOCATE. FOR OUR YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- ONE REALLY THANK THE PANEL FOR THIS REALLY COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE. THE IT HER. APPROACH TO HELPING CHILDREN WITH THEIR MOLD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ONE OF THE THINGS IT IS KIND OF CONCERNING TO ME AS I SEE AN IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS THIS YEAR'S OUT IN SEVERAL OF THESE ITEMS. WHOM WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPENDING. DIRE NEED OF POST PANDEMIC THERE. THE YEARS OUT DON'T DO US ANY GOOD NOW. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE DESPERATE NEED OF FOR CHILDREN SO DO THEY'D WAIT FOR THE TWO OR THREE YEARS THAT WE- AND THEN THEY CAN HELP- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME- THE OTHER IS. I'VE NOT HEARD ANY MENTION OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CRISIS INTERVENTION OR CRISIS RESPONSE RATHER THAN HAVING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OR PUBLIC SAFETY RESPOND WE'RE A DISPATCHER WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE IS IT A PLEASE CALL RESERVE SHOULD THIS MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY BE SENT INSTEAD. PROVIDING BETTER OUTCOMES- LESS RISK ON BOTH PARTIES OF INJURY OR OR WORSE I'M SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF CAPACITY WITH PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST RESPONDERS TO BE ABLE TO BE AN INTEGRATED IN THIS. COMPONENT FOR. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT GO OUT AND THEN CAN ACTUALLY GET AND DETERMINE WHERE THAT. PERSON COULD GET CARE IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OF BEING ARRESTED AND THEN DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL GET DETERMINED FIFTY ONE FIFTY. IT'S REALLY WHAT I CONSIDER AN IMPERATIVE FIRST INITIAL- OPPORTUNITY TO HELP. AND I GIVE THEM TO SOMEONE MISTER CHAIRMAN SOME LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. I DON'T HEAR ANY INTEGRATION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTRES. NOT ONE BIT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PANEL HANDLES WHO. OUR COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTARY A DANGEROUS SON. WHERE FAMILIES HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS DUAL DIAGNOSIS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MAYBE A MODERATE TO SEVERELY AUTISTIC. OF CHILD THERE IS A COMPLETE CONNECTION HERE WHERE THIS HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED WERE THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE TO HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THIS MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT IS ABSOLUTELY- NEEDS TO GO FORWARD. THE OTHER IS THAT- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS IT IS PRESENT THAT'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE MOST CONTACT WITH THESE CHILDREN IN WHICH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE ONE HOP WHOLEHEARTEDLY. BUT HOW COME THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WASN'T INCLUDED. HOW COME THEY WEREN'T ASKED WHAT IT WOULD TAKE IN THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS AS THE EXPERTS WITH THESE CHILDREN WHAT IT WOULD TAKE COST WISE WERE EFFECTIVENESS TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THIS PROGRAM. THEY'RE NOT HERE. AND I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. AND A LOT OF THIS IS GRANT INCENTIVIZED SO IT'S IF THEY DON'T. WANT TO GO OUT FOR THE GRANT THEY DON'T HAVE TO. JUST PAY. WHEN YOU LOOK THE SCHOOLS EL CAP THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS BY THEY DON'T HAVE THIS CYCLE COULD PASS THEN HAVE THE ANYMORE SOME SCHOOLS HAVE EVEN OPTED OUT OF THE S. OKAY SO. WHAT DOES IT TAKE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CAPACITY OF GIVING INDIVIDUALS INTO THESE SCHOOLS AND THE SCHOOLS WOULD NOT. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT. PARTNERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE SUPERINTENDENT HON TONY THURMOND TO DETERMINE AND THEN. WHAT IS MR WHAT IS SAID CONTABILIDADE. HAND HOW COMES OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE DERIVED TO WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING WITH THIS EXPENSIVE MONEY- YOU KNOW I REALLY DO THINK THAT THE PEER TO PEER MENTIONED EARLIER IS IMPERATIVE BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH- UNFORTUNATE STIGMA ARE THEY JUST WE REALLY DO NEED TO ENGAGE OUR CHILDREN. FOR A PEER TO PEER SO FOR SUPPORT AND I THINK THAT'S WE'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF THE- INITIAL RESULTS OF SUCCESS- AND THEN ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PARTNERING WITH ORGANIZATIONS WHY HASN'T HAD ME. BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS. WE DON'T NEED TO RECREATE THE WHEEL WITH THEM INVOLVED I MEAN THEY'VE GOT IT THEY DO IT AND I NATION WIDE. AND SO I'M HOPING. THAT WE BROADEN OUR OUR OUTLOOK ON. THE ITV POPULATION WITH DDS THE REGIONAL CENTERS. ON THAT WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO FOR- A PARTNERSHIP AS- WE LOOK FORWARD TO. SERVICING THE CHILDREN ON A. HOPEFUL OUTCOME HELPFUL IN AND I THINK ONE OF THE LAST THINGS ARE CLOSE ON HIS THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN. WITH FAMILIES IS THE THIRD CHILD IS GETTING HELP BUT THERE'S A CAP ON THE ABOUT AMOUNT OF TIME THE HELP CAN BE PROVIDED AND I'M HOPING THAT WE ADDRESS THE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THROUGH MEDICARE MEDICARE WHATEVER IT IS BUT- IF IT'S FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN THAT CHILD IS NOT HELD. THAT THAT CAN BE EXTENDED. THAT pCHILD OR THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS THE ABILITY TO BE THOROUGHLY VETTED AND HELPED. FOR THAT MISTER TERRA I THANK YOU FOR MY OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I WAS HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND MEMBER FRAZIER'S COMMENTS PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE IDT POPULATION. SO WHAT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IN REGARDS TO THE COMMENTS AT A FEW KEY WORDS- I THINK THAT IT WILL BE CRITICAL THAT ADVOCACY- IS CONTINUE TO BE BUILTAND WE ARE FINE TUNING THE POLICY THAT WOULD BE DEFINITELY A KEEP IN MIND THE NINE EIGHT H. STRUCTURE THAT. MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE JUST. I'M TO THE VARIOUS CRISIS SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH OUR- JUSTICE INVOLVED PARTNERS ALONG THAT THAT BUILDS WE WILL BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT WE WILL NEED TO MAKE SURE WORK CONSIDERING AND AS WE DO THAT. ADDITIONALLY A REGIONAL CENTERS AND- THAT AND NOT IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PARTNER AS WE THINK THROUGH THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM IN THE SERVICES THAT THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT PLATFORM. IN THE VARIOUS POPULATIONS ARE THAT NEED TO BE SERVED AND HOW WE DO THAT SO I THINK WE WILL I'M DEFINITELY ENSURE THAT WE ARE PARTNERING ON THAT FRONT IN REGARDS THE TYPES OF SERVICES I'M BACK TO BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THROUGH THIS VIRTUAL PLATFORM- AND THEN AND THEN LASTLY AND DEFINITELY NOT NOT LEAST IN REGARDS TO PARTNERING WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS I MEAN WE HAVE. WITHIN A NUMBER INITIATIVES OUT BEFORE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY AS OTHERS BEEN REALLY PARTNERING I REALLY IN TAKING AS CRITICAL STEPS TO FORGE PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXPANDING THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES AVAILABLE IN SCHOOL THAT WE ARE LINKING TO TWO SCHOOLS. ON TO ENSURE THAT THAT CHILDREN CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES- AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTNER WITH US IN REGARDS THAT POLICY BUILD- AND GETTING ALL OF THEIR FEEDBACK AND INPUT ALONG THE WAY AS THEY HAVE BEEN CRITICAL PARTNERS WITH US I'M FROM THE BEGINNING IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS A PROPOSAL- THAT WE HAVE BEEN BETTING AS WELL AS WILL BE CRITICAL PARTNERS FOR THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I'M TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ROLLED OUT IN A COMPREHENSIVE. WAY I WOULD ALSO JUST HIGHLIGHT IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE GAPS THAT WERE MENTIONED THAT SCHOOLS MAY HAVE- WELL I AGREE WITH YOU- GRANTS DO YOU HAVE TO BE. APPLIED FOR BY THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT OF THOSE. DOLLARS FOR SCHOOLS WOULD ALLOW TO PAY FOR. A THE INVESTMENT OR INCENTIVIZE- THE HIRING OF. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AS WELL AS THE PEER TO PEER- ENVIRONMENTS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACHES AND SO WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES THEY- WOULD BE ABLE TO FILL SOME OF THE- THE GAPS. THAT HAVE EXISTED IN TO BROKER SOME OF THOSE THOSE NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIS PLATFORM. AS WELL. THANK YOU WITHOUT A WILL BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR JUST FOR A COMMENT I WANT TO START BY AGREEING WITH TOBY EWING THAT THIS IS BOTH A BROAD AND HISTORIC AND BEST. THAT FOCUSES ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS AS WELL AS ON COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. I AM QUITE IMPRESSED% WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND ITS BREATH AND ABILITY TO HELP US TO BUILD A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOUNDATION THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH THIS DEPARTMENTS TO BUILD IN THE OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WILL NEED FOR THIS SIZE OF INVESTMENT. THE REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT MANY OF THE PROPOSALS- FROM THE VIRTUAL PANEL TO THE DYADIC SERVICES TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE EXTENDING WITH. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACHES AND COUNSELORS IS INCREDIBLE AND QUITE NEEDED. I LOOK FORWARD TO US AS A STATE MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS AND- REALLY AGAIN WANTS TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. WITHOUT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE WHICH IS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. MAY REVISE UPDATES WE WILL HAVE FOR PRISONERS ON THIS PANEL STARTING WITH TOBY EWING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MHS OAC. FOLLOWED BY ILEANA IT ALMOST AND SO NON BUT THEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOLLOWED BY COREY HI SHEILA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MISTER EWING CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. YOU'RE VERY MUCH TO BE DOING ON BEHALF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO AGAIN TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT. YOU MAY RECALL THAT IT THE COMMISSION INITIALLY USE SOME OF OUR SB TO TRIAGE FUNDS. TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO BUILD OUT A ROBUST PARTNERSHIP. TO MEET THAT NOW HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND WE JUST HAD A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWED UP ESTABLISHING A MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT. M. WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING. AND MILLION OF TIME MONEY THAT THAT ALLOCATED TO COMMISSION WE ABLE. COBBLE TOGETHER SEVENTY FIVE NINE DOLLARS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. TO SUPPORT MY ENDED UP BEING EIGHTEEN COUNTY SCHOOL PER. WE HAD A- TOTAL OF THIRTY EIGHT COUNTY APPLICATIONS COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP APPLICATIONS FROM ACROSS THE STATE THE FUNDING WE HAD AND IT AT THE TIME ONLY ALLOWED US TO FIND EIGHTEEN OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. THE R. TWENTY GRANTS THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND- K. FROM SMALL COUNTIES SIZED AND LAW COUNTY ALL THE STATE AS WE DISTRIBUTED WE MADE SURE THAT THESE FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE BASED ON DIFFERENT COUNTY SIZES FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES WERE COMPETING AGAINST THE LARGEST COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT MORE IMPORTANT TODAY THAN THEY WERE WHEN WE SET THIS PROGRAM NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE STARTED THIS INITIATIVE. PRIOR TO COPE AND COUNTIES ARE USING THESE FUNDS AB ACTUALLY THE PARTNERSHIPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE ACCOUNTED TO HEAR HEALTH DEPARTMENT ONE OR MORE. LOCAL SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND OR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND AT THE DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS THE DESIGNATED DIFFERENT LEADS WE GET THIS INTENTIONALLY. OUR OUR PRIMARY MOTIVATION WAS TO- INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS TO SIT DOWN AND WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN LEVERAGE THE STRENGTHS OF THE SCHOOLS BRING. AND THE STRENGTHS THAT THE COUNTIES BRING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND IN MANY CASES THEIR FAMILIES. ARE OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE USING THESE FUNDS TO DO SCREENING TO DO TRAININGS TO DELIVER CARE. TO STUDENTS THROUGH THE SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THERE'S A RANGE OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE TAILORED. TO THE. LOCAL NEEDS OF THOSE PARTNERS. THEY GRANT RANGED IN SIZE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR SMALL COUNTIES FOUR MILLION FOR MEDIUM SIZED COUNTIES IN THE LARGEST GRANT WAS LIMITED TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A LARGE COUNTIES WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE COUNTY LIKE LOS ANGELES IS INADEQUATE- THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE FUNDING BY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND. THOSE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES TO IT WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL SIX COUNTIES THE MAY REVISE ADDS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO THAT AMOUNT WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO ACT IN AND ANOTHER SIX COUNTY SO TOTAL TWELVE. TO MOVE LAST- FROM THE EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY COUNTIES. THE IT ALSO INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT AND EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF HOW WELL THAT PROGRAM IS WORKING OVERTIME. SO WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING WITH OUR PARTNERS APPLICANTS TO USING THE LANGUAGE OF. OF AN EMERGENCY OR CRISIS TO SORT OF PRE POSITION THESE CONTRACTS WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLOCATION THAT WE BELIEVE IS COMING. IS TO BE ABLE TO SIGN CONTRACTS THAT WOULD BEEFFECTIVE JULY ONE. AND THE GOAL THERE IS THAT WE CAN. DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ON OUR SIDE. TO ALLOW OUR SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERS TO HAVE SERVICES IN PLACE. AS STUDENTS BEGIN TO RETURN TO CAMPUS IN THE FALL. THAT MAY NOT MEAN THAT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS CAN REACT THAT QUICKLY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IN OUR BEHAVIOR AND ACTIONS ARE EFFORTS IMPEDES THEIR ABILITY TO BE AS RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS. OF THEIR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES AS THEY CAN BE- WE SEE THIS AS VERY. IDEAS THE TERM SHOVEL READY IN THE PAST- BUT BASED ON SOME COMMENTS I WOULD SAY CLASSROOM OR STUDENT READY WE WANT TO BE A STUDENT READY AS WE CAN. AND BELIEVE THIS IS A PRIME OPPORTUNITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE IMMEDIATE. NEEDS OF STUDENTS. UNDER THE TO. WRECK THAT THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS THAT NEEDS ARE JUST- INAPPROPRIATELY HIGH. HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE PROGRAM WITH PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE CHANCE TO TALK. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ILEANA RAMOS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I WILL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALL PATEL.

I'M IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT FOR THE AUGMENTATION TO THE PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM AND GIVEN THE OASES HISTORICALLY BEING FUNDED WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FIND- WE REVIEW THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE MENTAL SERVICES FIND AT ME REVISION AND DETERMINE THAT THE FINE COULD SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION. ADDITIONALLY THE FUND HAS NOT BEEN RECONCILED AT THIS TIME AND GIVEN THE CHALLENGE WITH MULTIPLE MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS SPENDING OUT OF THIS FUND AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF EXISTING ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY AUGMENTATIONS WE THINK THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ME REVISIONIST FISCALLY PRUDENT- THANK YOU AND NO FURTHER COMMENTS BUT WE ARE AT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE ILEANA RAMOS ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE GO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

PROJECT THAT IS STUDENT READY SHOVEL READY THAT WE CAN HELP TO GET UP AND RUNNING BY JULY FIRST I ALSO WANT TO THANK HIM FOR WORKING AND HELPING TO PRE POSITION SOME OF THE CONTRACTS. AS I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE CAN HELP TO GET OUR STUDENTS NEEDS ADDRESSED AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL PANEL FOR ON THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY MAY REVISE UPDATES. WE WILL HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING DOCTOR DAVE DUNCAN DIRECTOR. LOUIS BRONCHI CHIEFDEPUTY DIRECTOR RICK TRUSSELL CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION CRAIG JOHNSON CHIEF DISASTER MEDICAL SERVICE DIVISION WITHIN THE EMSA.

I THANK YOU DOCTOR DOKKEN AND GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BUT THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY HAS FOR BUDGET PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN THE MAY REVISION WHICH- IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE. IS THE INCREASE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE CAPABILITY- MS IS REQUESTING EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FOURTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS. REDUCING THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION OGOING BEGINNING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THESE RESOURCES WILL MAINTAIN CRITICAL EQUIPMENT AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES ACQUIRED DURING THE COLDER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND PROVIDE LIFESAVING LIFESAVING RESUSCITATIVE IN MEDICAL SEARCH SEARCH SERVICES TO RELIEVE SUFFERING FOR DISASTER VICTIMS DURING PANDEMICS ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCIES. SEVEN OF THE REQUESTED POSITIONS THREE POINT ONE MILLION FOR WAREHOUSE SPACE IN TWO MILLION FOR BIOMEDICAL MAINTENANCE ARE FUNDED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. THESE LIMITED TERM RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE MS A SUFFICIENT TIME TO DETERMINE A POST PANDEMIC STAFFING RESOURCE NEEDS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET INCREASED DISASTER MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING IS REQUESTED TO UPGRADE MS AS DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS CENTER INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE CASH IS. AVAILABLE WHICH CONTAIN MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR. RESPONSE EFFORTS THE SPEED OF MS ABILITY TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE TO DISASTER VICTIMS CRITICAL IN ANY DISASTER MAJOR EVENT WHILE MS A CONTINUES TO STAND READY FOR THREATS TO CALIFORNIA RECENT PANDEMIC IN WILDFIRE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES HAVES HAVE REVEALED CRITICAL GAPS IN OUR RESPONSE CAPABILITIES- MS IS REQUESTING FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO FILL THESE GAPS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE TREND DEMONSTRATES INCREASING NATURAL AND MAN MADE DISASTERS AND I NEED FRIENDS ARE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORT MULTIPLE RESPONSE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE AT ONE POINT DURING THE CURRENT CULTURE NINETEEN STATEWIDE WILDFIRE RESPONSES AMSEL WAS SUPPORTING SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT MISSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY THESE MEDICAL MISSIONS INCLUDED FEDERAL MEDICAL STATIONS ALTERNATE CARE SITES LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WHICH INCLUDE- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING IN ADDITION AND THE CONTINUED OPERATION SUPPORTING MULTIPLE WAREHOUSES DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS CENTER LOCAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER LIAISON ROLES MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AMSEL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER RESOURCE TO MEET THE NEEDS AND RELIED ON OUTSIDE SUPPORT TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS RESULTING IN NUMEROUS SHORTFALLS IN CHALLENGES. THE FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF MS A STAFF TO SERVE IN LEADERSHIP AT VARIOUS MEDICAL STATES WAS LACKING IN EXPERIENCE MEDICAL STAFF ASSIGNED TO FILL INCIDENT COMMAND LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AT ALTERNATE TREATMENT SITES. NUMBER PERSONAL SUPPORT RECEIVING PROCESSING STORAGE AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES INCLUDING VENTILATORS TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE. THAT LACKED THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL TO MANAGE MULTIPLE INTO WAREHOUSES TO SUPPORT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. AND AN INSUFFICIENT NUMBER PERSONAL TO EFFECTIVELY RECRUIT ONBOARD AND TRAIN THE THOUSANDS OF CALUMET MEMBERS THAT WE BROUGHT ON BOARD TO SUPPORT OUR STATEWIDE MEDICAL NEEDS WHICH INCLUDED ALTERNATE CARE SITES LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES HOSPITALS SURGICAL PROTESTING IT CETERA- IN CONCLUSION THE RESOURCES OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL REQUIP MS THAT TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORT THE NECESSARY EXPANSION TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO FUTURE STATEWIDE DISASTERS THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT DEFICITS IN OUR STATEWIDE MEDICAL HEALTH RESPONSE CAPABILITY. AND AND WE'RE GONNA BE BETTER PREPARED TO MEET OUR NEW DEMANDS BY PROVIDING ADEQUATE STAFFING LEVELS BEING ABLE TO HIRE PERSONNEL THAT WILL SYSTEM RESPONSE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT LARGE SCALE RESPONSES TO DISASTERS AND ALL CALIFORNIA REGIONS ENSURING SMOOTH RESPONSE TO EMERGING THREATS TO CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS SUCH AS COVE IN NINETEEN HI ADDITIONAL HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFLUENZA PANDEMICS INDOOR OUTSIDE THREATS- TO CALIFORNIA ENHANCING CATASTROPHIC EVENT PLANNING TRAINING EXERCISES AND MEDICATION TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS IN ADVANCE A MAJOR DISASTERS. AND WE'RE NOW OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT PROPOSAL NUMBER. ONE THANK YOU SIR IF YOU CAN RUN THROUGH ALL OF THE PROPOSALS ALL FOUR OF THEM AND THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOLLOWED BY THE L. A. L.

THE REQUESTED RESOURCES INCLUDE FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS WITH THREE OF THE REQUESTED POSITIONS FUNDED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AMSEL ANALYZE AND EVALUATE WHETHER THESE HR STAFFING LEVELS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF STAFF OR SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED HR WORKLOAD AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PERSONAL HR ACTIVITIES. PROVIDING HR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IN ANY STATE DEPARTMENT IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING WILLIAMS IS A SMALL DEPARTMENT HR UNIT IS STILL TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE SAME STATE PROCESS PROGRAM AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AS ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY HR ANALYST ANOTHER DEPARTMENTS MAY ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE CLASSIFICATION PAY EXAMINATIONS ARE TRAINING BUT MS A SOLE HR- ANIMAL. IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE SERVICES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN MANY OTHER PROGRAM AREAS. THE PERSONAL NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INCREASED WITH PROGRAM EXPANSIONS EXPANSIONS WHICH INCLUDE NEW POSITIONS INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES POSITIONAL H. R. STAFFING RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. A STARKLY MS AS COMBINED ADMINISTRATIVE AND HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTIONS WITHIN A SINGLE DIVISION ALL THIS COMBINED RESPONSIBILITY MIGHT BE MANAGEABLE FOR AN ORGANIZATIONAL MORE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE WORKLOADS. MS AS UNIQUE IN THAT THE DEPARTMENT MANAGES PROGRAMS ENCOMPASSING ROUTINE ACTIVITIES WITH ANOTHER DISASTER MEDICAL SERVICES WHOSE DISASTER RESPONSE ACTIVITIES MAY AT ANY TIME EXPAND RAPIDLY WHICH CAN REQUIRE ENDS AT A HIGHER LARGE NUMBERS OF EMERGENCY STAFF. THIS CAN RESULT IN OTHER DIVISIONS PROGRAMS REDUCING OR SUSPENDING ACTIVITIES. AND REDIRECTING BOTH FRONT LINE AND MANAGEMENT STAFF TO HR FUNCTIONS CONCURRENT WITH THESE DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN ANNE'S FOCUS. IS THE NEED TO RECRUIT ONBOARD AND MANAGE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN PREPARATION FOR FUTURE EMERGENCY RESPONSE DEPLOYMENTS. THE NUMBERS OF THESE EMERGENCY HIRES IS UNPREDICTABLE BUT THE TREND IN RECENT YEARS A SCENE SHARP INCREASE DURING THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE THE NUMBERS HAVE BALLOONED EXPONENTIALLY. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MS THAT MUST DELAY OR SIMPLY FORGO CENTRAL HR FUNCTIONS. HAVING INSUFFICIENT STAFFING RESOURCES TO MEET AND AS HR NEEDS WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE STAFF MORALE YOU CONTRIBUTE TO DELAYS IN FULFILLING BOTH ROUTINE AND DISASTER RELATED. DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. THE INCREASE STAFF LEVELS ALLOW THE TO MEET CRITICAL HR TO AND TIMELINES. SPECIALLY MANDATED REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FOR YOU TO CREMINS IN THE CREATION OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE HR DIVISION- THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WILL ALLOW THE HR DIVISION TO INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS TO VARIOUS INTERNAL PROGRAMS WITH MS- ELIMINATE DELAY IN RESPONSE TIME TO EXECUTIVE STAFF MANAGERS AND OTHER CONTROL AGENCY REQUESTS. AND REQUIREMENTS. PROPOSAL NUMBER FOUR. IS THE CALIFORNIA EMS DATA RESOURCE SYSTEM OR CEDARS MS IS REQUESTING ONE TIME TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INTO POSITIONS THIS REQUEST WILL GO TOWARDS PROJECT PLANNING FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DATA RESOURCE SYSTEM OR CEDARS UTILIZING THE STATE'S PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS AND TO CONNECT THE REMAINING SEVENTEEN LOCAL EMS AGENCIES TO AN EXISTING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES NETWORK THE PROPOSED CEDARS IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LINK. RECENT DATA INTEROPERABLE IN BETWEEN HOSPITAL'S EMS AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS. INSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE TO CURRENTLY I'M COVERED AREAS OF THE STATE. READING CONNECTIONS IN THESE AREAS WILL ALSO ALLOW ACCESS TO ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THESE NEW CONNECTIONS. CURRENTLY ANSWER HAS TO DATA SYSTEMS ARE NOT CAN CONNECTED THAT COLLECT EMS DATA. THE FIRST IS THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR KIM SAYS THE SECOND IS THE HIGH TENS WHICH IS THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN EMS SYSTEMS. I AM SO PROPOSES CONNECTING THESE TWO SYSTEMS TO ALLOW FOR BETTER DATA QUALITY REAL TIME REPORTING BY CREATING CEDARS NOW LOCAL PLATFORM THAT WILL INFORM AND IMPROVE THE STATEWIDE AND LOCAL EMS SYSTEMS. SEEDERS WILL BE FURTHER USED TO PROVIDE A CONNECTION TO C. H. HSA IS ALL HAS OUR DASHBOARD BY CONNECTING CEDARS TO THE DASHBOARD AND WILL BE ABLE TO FEED REAL TIME DATA. TO STATE DECISION MAKERS DURING TIMES OF DISASTER HAVING REAL TIME DATA ON PATIENT COUNTS TYPES OF CALLS AND LOCATIONS OF OUTBREAKS WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO BETTER PLAN RESPOND TO LEVELS OF DISASTER. THE CHANCES SYSTEM COLLECTS DATA RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. INDIAN SHE'S IN PRE HOSPITAL CARE REPORTING SOFTWARE MANAGED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS- EMS PROVIDER AGENCIES IN TRAUMA CENTERS AS REQUIRED BY TITLE TWENTY TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS. IN MOST CASES THIS ENCOUNTER LEVEL DATA IS TRANSFERRED BY EMS PROVIDERS AND TRAUMA CENTERS. TO ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY THREE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATION OF UMASS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH DIVISION TWO POINT FIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. THE DATA REFLECTS PATIENT TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES THE M. S. TRAUMA CASES BASED ON NATIONAL DATA COLLECTION STANDARDS- WHILE THIS DATA CAN BE USED TO PLAN IMPROVE EMS TRAUMA BY LOCAL EMS AGENCIES. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO COMPARE BENCHMARK OR INTEGRATE WITH LIKE PROVIDER AGENCIES OR THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT. IN SHORT MS IT DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TIMELY STATEWIDE YOU MUST PATIENT LEVEL DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO PROACTIVELY IMPROVE OUTCOMES. MS OUR PROVIDES THE INLAND COUNTIES EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY WITH LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FUNDING TO COLLECT PRE HOSPITAL TRAUMA DATA VIA ISOMERS. CHANCES ARE FROM THIRTY TWO OF THIRTY THREE LENSES COVERING AN ESTIMATED EMS ENCOUNTERS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY. SUBMISSION OF DATA TO ISOMER FROM LOCAL EMS AGENCIES IS DONE ON A LARGELY VOLUNTEER BASIS. DOES NOT ALL AND NOT ALWAYS IN REAL TIME. WELL 65% UNKNOWN EMS ENCOUNTERS ARE RECORDED AT ISOLA THE QUALITY CONSISTENCY AND RELIABILITY OF THAT DATA IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE USED TO INFORM SIGNIFICANT POLICY MAKING. INSTEAD ARE. HI OR THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MERCY MEDICAL SERVICES- IN TODAY'S EMS US BECAUSE WE IN TODAY'S EMS SYSTEM AMBULANCE AND PARAMEDICS SERVICES HAVE NO MEANS FOR PROVIDING ELECTRONIC HERE DATED TO THE HOSPITAL'S WE'RE RECEIVING THEIR PATIENTS SAM NO INSIGHT INTO HOW THEIR CARE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AFFECTED ULTIMATE OUTCOMES COMMUNICATIONS NECESSARY TO TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION RECEIVED TREATMENT HOURS BETWEEN EMS PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL IS DONE VERBALLY TO RADIO OR CELL PHONE. OFTEN PAPER BASED PRE HOSPITAL CARE RECORDS ARE LEFT AT THE HOSPITAL AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSPORT- ON JULY TWENTY SIX TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE OFF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AWARDED MS- TWO YEAR GRANT TO ADVANCE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE STATEWIDE DURING A DISASTER AND REGIONALLY. AND DALY MS ON A LIMITED PILOT BASIS PILOT COUNTIES INCLUDING SAN DIEGO ORANGE MATERIAL SAMPOERNA DINO. FUNDING WAS USED TO DEMONSTRATE TO HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY USE CASES. DURING THE TWO YEAR GRANT CYCLE WHICH ENDED ON JULY TWENTY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- TOOLS ARE VITAL TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. THE FIRST USE CASE NAME PLUS YOU KNOW MASS CREATED LOCAL IS PART OF THE GRANT WAS DESIGNED FOR DAY TO DAY IN US OPERATIONS IN CONNECTED EMS PROVIDERS WITH HOSPITALS TO SECURELY EXCHANGE ELECTRONIC PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION. THE PLUS YOU MUST USE CASE FOCUSED ON THE BI DIRECTIONAL EXCHANGE OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT PATIENT INFORMATION WITH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS BY EMS PERSONNEL. THE TRANSMITTAL PATIENT DATA IMPROVES A TRANSITION OF KERR FROM THE PRE HOSPITAL SETTING TO THE HOSPITAL AMSEL WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT H. I. YUNEEC THE MS AND FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. TO ALLOW PARAMEDICS TO SEARCH FOR PATIENT INFORMATION LEARN THE HOSPITAL'S INCOMING PATIENTS AND FATHER RECORD IN THE HOSPITAL'S EHR AND CHAIN OUTCOME INFORMATION. WHICH WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IN THE SECOND CASE MS OF THE- OF FIRST LOOKED TO HELP. TOOL TO BE USED DURING EMERGENCIES AND NATURAL DISASTERS IN THIS USE CASE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING FASTER CAN SEARCH AND RETRIEVE. PATIENT HEALTH HISTORY ALLOWING THEM TO IMPROVE CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. CURRENTLY ONLY SIXTEEN OF THE THIRTY THREE LENSES ARE COVERED BY A CHINESE NEMS SYSTEMS. THIS LEAVES SEVENTEEN LIVES IN OUR POPULATIONS BEHIND WITH REGARD TO QUICK ACCESS TO PATIENT INFORMATION DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. MANY OF THE UN COVERED LENSES ARE ROLE OR HAVE LARGE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. AND THE SIX TO CLOSE THIS GAP IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. WITH THIS FUNDING MS- ROLE WILL REINVIGORATE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BY ASSISTING LOCAL ENTITIES. TO CREATE DATA PIPELINES THAT ALLOW FOR REAL TIME HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE HUB THAT ALLOWS LOCAL EMS AGENCIES TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE IT HE MUST DATA. AND TECHNOLOGY TOOLS THAT CONTINUE THE SKEWS ME THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A SINGLE SOURCE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE CARE DURING DISASTERS. THIS REQUIRES CHANGES TO EXISTING AND SYSTEMS. AND THEIR INTEGRATION. INTO A- HUB. AND THAT IS THE END OF THE TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT THE PROBLEM THE FINANCE THAT WE HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DR EMERSON YOU PICK FROM THE L. A. WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THAT THE DETAILED BUDGET PROPOSALS FROM AND SO- THAT THAT JUST CAME OUT YESTERDAY AT THIS POINT WE DON'T- HAVE ANY SEEK TO HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS OR SEE ANY BIG RED FLAGS BUT OF COURSE WE'D REACH OUT TO YOU. TO THE- BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE STAFF- IF THAT CHANGES AT ALL AS WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. YOUR QUESTION FOR MS- I- WAS OBVIOUSLY LISTENING TO YOUR PRESENTATION AT THE VERY END YOU TALKED ABOUT. DATA TRANSFER FROM PROVIDERS AND DURING DURING EMERGENCIES SO- HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WHICH GOT GOT MY GOT MY ATTENTION- I'M CURIOUS- YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT THERE'S THERE THERE CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS- IN AREAS WHERE THERE ISN'T RURAL WHERE YOU HAVE LARGE POPULATIONS DO YOU STILL HAVE THOSE CHALLENGES- COMMUNICATING ACROSS PROVIDERS AND FOR EXAMPLE ARE YOU ARE THERE CERTAIN PROVIDERS THAT ARE. THAT YOU HAVE CHALLENGES WITH OR DO YOU FOR ARE YOU FINDING THE SYSTEMS TO BE WORKING WELL- I'M GATHERING. THE ANSWER MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY CALLING FOR A STATE WIDE HUB WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AS WELL SO I'M I'M CURIOUS. TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE IS- IN THE FIELDS HOW YOU HOW YOU COMMUNICATE ACROSS ALL PROVIDERS AND- JUST JUST A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION. HE DOCTOR WOULD DAVE DUNCAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND- YOU CAUGHT MY ATTENTION EARLIER- WITH YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR REAL TIME HEALTHCARE DATA TO MAKE REAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS AND YOU MADE THE POINT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT POINT WAS SO STRONGLY MADE THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WITH CODED- YOU KNOW REACHING OUT FOR. MULTIPLE DATA POINTS ON A DAILY BASIS LOOKING FOR THEM ON AN HOURLY BASIS- MAYBE OBTAINING THEM ON A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BASIS BUT HAVING TO MAKE REAL DECISIONS BASED ON. DATA THAT- YOU KNOW JUST UNFORTUNATELY- ISN'T THERE IT WILL IT'S THERE IT'S JUST NOT THERE AS TIMELY AS WE LIKE TO HAVE IT. SO THAT'S SAID THIS IS THE FIRST IN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO START. MOVING OUR WAY TOWARDS REAL TIME. UNIFIED DATA WHERE WE HAVE AND AGAIN IN YOUR WORDS SILOS TALKING TO EACH OTHER SO WE HAVE PMS DATA WE HAVE IT FROM RURAL WE HAVE IT FROM BOURBON- WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT IS TIMELY AS WE BLANK- AND WE DON'T HAVE IT. EVERYWHERE UNIFIED WITH HOSPITAL SYSTEMS SO- THAT SAID YOU KNOW IN IN ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION- THE H. I EAT PEAS I'VE I MEAN IN GENERAL TERMS WORK WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THERE WE LIKE TO GET ALL THE WAY THERE- TO UNIFY THE EMS. DATA WITH THE HOSPITAL DATA. BUILDING THE SYSTEM AND PLANNING AS WE'VE OUTLINED IN OUR PROPOSAL NUMBER FOUR. WILL CREATE THE PATHWAY TOWARDS REAL TIME ACCESS TO THIS DATA. AND- IT'LL ALL GIVE US WHAT I LIKE TO CALL SORT OF THE VITAL SIGNS WE NEED TO ASSESS. THE AND MEDIA IT'S- A PERSPECTIVE OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. I MAY BE AROUND THE BUSH A BIT THERE ARE UP BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE INITIAL STEPS THE BILL THAT IN THE HIV ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE ON A PATH. TOWARDS BETTER DATA INTEGRATION AND THEN THE PLANNING WILL PAVE THE WAY TOWARDS- BETTER ACCESS CURRENTLY A REGULATION AND- PROVIDES AMSA WITH QUARTERLY DATA. FROM ALL OF OUR EMS SYSTEMS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ALL THIRTY THREE LAUNCHERS AND WE'D LIKE TO IMPROVE THEM. THANK YOU. SHIPPED UP.

OPERATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE FROM I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE BUT THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS REALLY A GAP ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND. HOW MANY MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY LEAVING OUR STATE TO ENTER INTO RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS ALLOCATION WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO. MEET THAT GAP AND SO HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE INFORMATION BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF WHAT THE QUESTION IS.

FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND THEN LASTLY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO ADD TO THE ADDITIONAL CONTINUING INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS TO FUNDS OR THE ABILITY FOR US TO CONSTRUCT ACQUIRE A REBEL REHABILITATE A REAL ESTATE ASSETS TO EXPAND THE CONTINUE OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH. SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ADDITION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING A TO ADD A DO LET BENEFITS TO MEDICARE ALL THE BUDGET INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR THE DO A BENEFIT TO IMPLEMENT JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE ACS PROPOSES TO ADD THE DEALER BENEFIT AS A PREVENTATIVE OF BENEFIT IN MEDIC CAL. THE SERVICES INCLUDE PERSONAL SUPPORT TO PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY LABOR AND POSTPARTUM PERIOD. REACHER STRONGLY SUGGEST THE DO THE BENEFIT CAN RESULT OFF I'M SETTING SAVINGS DUE TO AVOIDANCE OF PRETERM BIRTHS. AND CESAREAN DELIVERIES THE MAIN REVISED DOES NOT ASSUME COST SAVINGS HOWEVER SUCH A SAVINGS- COULD ACCRUE AS REDUCTIONS IN THE BASE EXPENDITURES. AS WE MATERIALIZE OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY I'M CAL IS. ON TO OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AS A BENEFIT THE BUDGET INCLUDES COST OF SIXTEEN POINT THREE MILLION TOTAL FUND- IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YOU. WITH THAT GROWING AND EXPANDING OVER MANY YEARS AND WE HAVE A MULTI YEAR WE CAN SHARE WITH THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED. I'M IT IS PROPOSED TO BEGIN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ADDITIONALLY ARE REALLY JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE IN REGARDS TO THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER- BENEFIT IN MEDICARE. FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE PROVIDED THESE SERVICES THROUGH VARIOUS PILOTS OR PLANES HAVE PROVIDED AND PAID FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS SERVICES HOWEVER MAKING IT A MEDIC HEALTH BENEFIT. PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A FULL NETWORK OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS REALLY HELPING TO BROKER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES TO GO IN AND PROVIDE NOT ONLY. AN EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR FAMILIES BUT REALLY TO BROKER RELATIONSHIPS. AND BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE CULTURAL AND OR LANGUAGE BURIAL SIT IN OFTEN EXIST FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS BY HELPING THEM NAVIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ASSIST THEM IN ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AS WELL AS PROVIDER HEALTH EDUCATION MINNESOTA PORTENT OF. FOR THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE ARE SEVENTY AND- WITHIN CALLIN IN THE PROPOSAL UNKNOWNS NOTABLE THE MEDICARE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE SO THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUND. THREE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR LOCAL LISTINGS FUNDING IN FIFTEEN MILLION TOTAL FUNDS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR STATE OPERATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL- WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL- WE ARE LOOKING TO PROCURE A BUSINESS SOLUTION THAT WOULD UTILIZE BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA. AND INFORM THE DEPARTMENT. OF MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTIES PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER DEPARTMENT PARTNERS- IN THE USE OF SUPPORTING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR MEDIC CAL DELIVERY ARE BENEFICIARIES. WERE REALLY WANTING TO USE THIS POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT- SERVICE YOU. POLL DATA ACROSS ALL OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF MEDIC TO ALLOW IT TO BE A VERY HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR DELIVERING MEDICAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS WOULD INCLUDE MANY OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR LARGER CALLIN POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDING THE STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE RISK ASSESSMENT- AS WELL AS THE STRATIFICATION AND RISK TEARING. THAT WOULD BE DONE IN CALLING WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS PLATFORM. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT IDENTIFYING GAP CLOSURE WITHIN THIS PLATFORM SO ENSURING THAT BENEFICIARIES FOR EXAMPLE KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THEY HAVE RECEIVED OR HAVE NOT RECEIVED. WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT DISEASE MANAGEMENT CLOSING CLINICAL- GAPS AND MAKING SURE THAT NOT ONLY PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES ARE WHERE THOSE SERVICES BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO USE THAT AS AN ANALYTICAL BACKLOG- ANALYTICAL. BACKBONE I SHOULD SAY NOT BACKLOG. OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SERVICES ARE NEEDED FOR BENEFICIARIES TO IMPROVE OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION. WE ALSO WOULD BE USING THIS TO IDENTIFIED GAPS IN BENEFITS YOUR REFERRALS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS NOT ON BREAK. SO PULLING IN NOT ONLY BE A JUST YESTERDAY BUT DATA BUT SO DATA TO REALLY INFORM AND DRY FROM. APART SHE AND- AS WELL AS EIGHT REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CASE MANAGERS AND CARE COORDINATION GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MEDICARE SYSTEM. SO WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. FOR THE CASE MANAGER WHERE THOSE GAPS MAY EXIST TO MAKE SURE THOSE REFERRALS ARE HAPPENING AND TO CLOSE THE LOOP FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING MEDICARE DATA INTO THE PLATFORM ONE OF THE CRITICAL PIECES AROUND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CMS IN GETTING MEDICARE DATA. IT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS PLATFORM CARD TO A BENEFICIARIES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY MEETING FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF SHARING THAT DATA BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT OUR INDIVIDUALS ARE DO NDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING BETTER COORDINATED CARE. ANY OF THESE STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND ROLLED OUT THROUGH MEDICARE WOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT BENEFICIARY REALLY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REPEAT ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN OFTEN HAPPEN. FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES I'M IN THE PORTAGE STREAMLINING NOT BASED ON SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH BENEFICIARY FOCUS GROUPS AND OTHERS IN REGARDS TO WHAT THEY CALL ASSESSMENT FOR. PETIQ IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. WE ALSO WOULD BE LOOKING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND REALLY ALLOWING US TO DRIVE DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION THROUGH A PLATFORM THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. TO NOT ONLY DH CS BUT THE PLANS PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES. ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE AD BUDGET WE HAVE SOME FUNDS FOR PROVIDING ACCESS IN TRANSFORMING HEALTH OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS PASSED. THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUNDS ARE ONE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO SHIFT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN ADVANCE THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES THROUGH THE JUSTICE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE CALTRAIN. AND PROPOSAL BEFORE THAT- LEGISLATURES WHILE THESE FUNDS WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO JUSTICE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN FIND THE SUPPORT AROUND I'M NOT ONLY THE- ENROLLMENT OF INDIVIDUALS INTO MEDICARE ALL BUT THE THIRTY DAY IN REACH OF SERVICES. AS WELL AS THE COURT NEEDED RE ENTRY OF INDIVIDUALS INTO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES UPON RELEASE AS WELL AS CONNECTING THEM TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT WHEN APPROPRIATE. AS WELL AS VARIOUS IN LIEU OF SERVICES INCLUDING THOSE HOUSING SUPPORTS WHICH COULD BE SO CRITICAL FOR THEIR RE ENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE'S A DEDICATED AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR THAT JUSTICE PACKAGE WITHIN PASSED- BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ANY IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS PILOT PROGRAM. THE BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THIS REFLECTS THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVING AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME BUDGET. ALLOCATION OF NINE POINT THREE MILLION. I'M THIS IS TO ADD ON TO THE MEDICALLY TO OTHERS NO PROP- PILOT THAT HAS BEEN. IN PLACE FOR QUITE SOME TIME THERE'S AN ADDITION OF. ADDITIONAL COUNTIES INCLUDING FRESNO KINGS MADERA SANTA CRUZ TULARE AND CONTRA COSTA IN REGARDS TO THAT THAT PROGRAM- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THAT OKAY I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IN THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS PILOT REALLY AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE OFFERING AND CALLIE UNDER THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES- BUT REALLY EXPANDING WHERE WE CAN'T GO SERVICES. A PRIOR. TO THE IN THE SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE- THE NEIGHBOR OF THE ALSO PROVIDE. TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE ALL SUSPENSIONS OF PROPERTY SIX PAYMENTS AN OPTIONAL BENEFITS CURRENTLY IN LAW. I'M IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT WE ALSO PROPOSED ELIMINATING THE AB NINETY SEVEN RATE FREEZE OR I. C. F. T. D. R. AS WELL AS FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES. AND ESSENTIALLY THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING. AND THAT WE WOULD SEE THROUGH THIS INCREASE AN AVERAGE OF 3% PER DIEM RATE INCREASE ABOUT WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PRICE YET TNCS. IN PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES- WITH THE RATE CHANGE BEING EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE RATE YEAR BEGINNING AUGUST FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT'S WHEN THE NEW RATE WOULD WHAT BEGAN. IT ALSO JUST- OUT THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD UNFREEZE THE RATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WOULD RESULT IN THE RATE BEING UPDATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO REFLECT THE UPDATED COST RECORDED. SUBMITTED BY THE FACILITIES ALLOWING FOR ONGOING INCREASES IN THE FUTURE. THE RATE METHODOLOGY WOULD INCORPORATE UPDATED COST REPORT DATA TRENDED FORWARD TO THE RATE YEAR ALONG WITH ADD ONS TO ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL. OR STATE MANDATES THAT WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE COST REPORTS. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE PROPERTY SIX FUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS A PART OF THE CALCULATION FOR THE TOTAL UNFROZEN RATE. IN ESSENCE THE PROPERTY SIX FUNNY BECAUSE A PART OF THE- PERSON RATE ANY ADDITIONAL IS FUNDED THROUGH GENERAL FUND- AS THESE ARE AT SERVING NEARLY A 100% OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN THESE FACILITIES THE REVENUE FROM MEDIC HOW IT'S CRITICAL. TO THEIR PHYSICAL CONDITION WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNFREEZE THE RIGHT METHODOLOGY ON GOING TO ENSURE THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS ARE ABLE TO REFLECT THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES GOING FORWARD. IN THIS PROPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY YOUR YOU WILL SEE YOU IN- ARE BUDGET THERE ARE NUMBER OF. IMPACTS MOST NOTABLY AS AS- DIRECTOR LIKE BORN ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED. ON THERE IS A REDUCTION. IN THE ESTIMATED CASELOAD IMPACT FOR THE DEPARTMENT- WE CURRENTLY. I'M. HELLO THERE WE ARE- WE CURRENTLY ARE ESTIMATING- WITHIN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TIME CARRIED AN AVERAGE OF THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION BENEFICIARIES WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY I'M IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INCREASING THAT TO AN AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION BENEFICIARIES WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THIS WAS REALLY- UPDATED BASED OFF OF HAVING A MORE TIME TO ANALYZE REAL ENROLLMENT DATA THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AS WELL AS TRENDS WITH THAT DATA AND UPDATED TO REFLECT MORE DATA THAN WE HAD I'M DURING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELEASED IN JANUARY. YOU ALSO SEE SOME UPDATES IN REGARDS TO COST FOR TESTING PER CODE NINETEEN IN SCHOOLS AS WELL AS UPDATING THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS REFLECT PORTIONS OF THE OF THE YEAR- AS PROVIDED THROUGH THE- RESCUE PLAN ACT ADDITIONALLY YOU'LL SEE THE FUNDING MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY FOR COUNTY REDETERMINATION AS WELL AS OTHER CODE NINETEEN IMPACTS INCLUDING THE AN ENHANCED R. F. MAP THAT IS STILL AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ADDITIONALLY THERE A REQUEST FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DESIGNATED A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. ARE AS THEY HAVE BEEN A AN INTERNAL PARTNER IN REGARDS TO ADDRESSING THE CODE NINE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I'M IN REGARDS TO NOT ONLY TESTING I'M A PROVIDING SERVICES BUT ALSO REALLY AROUND SOME OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED FOR THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE BENEFICIARIES WHERE THEY DO SELF FUND THOSE SERVICES. AND REALLY HELPING TO CLOSE THE GAPS IN REGARDS TO YOUR VACCINATIONS BURKE NOT ONLY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS BUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT REALLY HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN REGARDS TO CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. AND SO WE ARE REQUESTING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS TO BE DIRECTED TO PUBLIC HOSPITALS SUPPORT THEIR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. THE ALSO SEE AN UPDATE IN REGARDS TO THE TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL- WITHIN THAT BUDGET I WE'RE ARE PROPOSING TO SET THE AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH. REIMBURSEMENT RATE AT 65% OF THE MEDICARE RATE FOR NON ACCURACY PROVIDERS SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR PHYSICIANS. AND OTHERS WHO ARE ABLE TO BILL ON THOSE IDEA ONLY TELEHEALTH SERVICES AND THEN WE WILL BE PREPARING. TO PROPOSE A COMPARABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE PPS RATE COURT S. U. H. C. CLINICS- TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY SERVICES. I WOULD KNOW AS PREVIOUSLY ARE PRESENTED AND THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE A WAIVER OF THE GPS AND COMMITMENT FROM THE FTC'S IF THEY ARE OKAY WITH THE WAIVER OF PPS PRESTON FORWARD AND GET THAT APPROVAL. FROM CMS. IT WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL. WE ALSO WOULD KNOW THAT THE- PROPOSAL UPDATES YOU ENSURE THAT ONLY PROVIDERS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA OR BORDER COMMUNITIES SIMILAR TO THE MEDIC HOW- ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS TODAY AND MEDICARE. AND ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE IN PERSON SERVICES BUT THEY MUST BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IN PERSON SERVICES TO EACH CLIENT'S SERVED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SYNCHRONOUS AN AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH SERVICES WITHIN THE PROGRAM. WE ALSO WILL BE- WORKING TO ENGAGE WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS- TO ESTABLISH UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POST PANDEMIC TELEHEALTH SERVICES. REALLY AROUND WHAT IS THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN IN PERSON ARE YOU ONLY IN OTHER TELEHEALTH MODALITIES I'M AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR OUR TELEHEALTH PROGRAM HERE- THAT THE DEPARTMENT. THERE ALSO IS A- I REQUEST FOR TWELVE MILLION. DOLLARS TOTAL FUND FOR MEDICATION THERAPY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM REALLY HERE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM FOR SPECIALTY PHARMACY SERVICES THIS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN REALLY FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX MEDICATION THERAPIES HIGH PRESCRIPTION COSTS OR HAVING OTHER RISKS THAT MAY RESULT IN IMPEDIMENTS OF THE BENEFICIARIES COMPLIANCE OR ADHERENCE WITH THOSE DRUGS- THAT'S ALSO IN THERE. AND LASTLY BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST OF FUNDS FOR THE SAN MATTEO DENTAL INTEGRATION PILOT PROGRAM SO THE ESTIMATE DOES INCLUDE SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT ANY DENTAL IMPLANTS AND INTEGRATION PILOT WITH HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO PURSUANT TO U. S. B. EIGHTEEN FORTY. EIGHT FORTY NINE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT REFLECTS DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS BETWEEN PEOPLE SERVICE TO MANAGED CARE I'M NOT DIFFERENCES IN COST BETWEEN THE TWO DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AND THIS WHICH INCLUDE THE COMMENTS A LINDSAY RENEE AND KELLY WILL BE pAVAILABLE FOR- QUESTIONS A LATER IF NECESSARY A BIT ARE NOT PRESENTING ANY ADDITIONAL. ITEMS ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT. THEY YOU MAX WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE PARTS DEPARTMENT YEAH I'M SORRY TIGER WOODS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE DEALT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA I'M COREY WITH THE L. A. L. HAN I'LL JUST BE SPEAKING ON A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES DISCUSSED ON ON THIS PANEL- MY COLLEAGUE BEN JOHNSON WILL WILL HANDLE THE REST AFTER ME- IN IN. FOR FIRST OFF- JUST TO COMMENT ON THE- THE MODIFY TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- OUR OFFICE RELEASED YOU KNOW RECENTLY AN ANALYSIS OF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S ORIGINAL JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR. TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT MEDICARE TELEHEALTH POLICY AND I'M GENERALLY IN OUR ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CLINICAL AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF TELEHEALTH AND- IT'S SORT OF ASSOCIATED FISCAL IMPACT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. AND SO YOU KNOW THE CONCLUSION THAT WE CAME TO WAS SORT OF THAT- IT WAS PREMATURE TO SORT OF ESTABLISH A PERMANENT MEDICARE TELEHEALTH POLICY AT THIS TIME GIVEN THAT THERE IS A LOT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT- TELEHEALTH AND HOW IT'S- EFFECTS ARE ARE IN SORT OF THE HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM- YOU KNOW IN ADDITION YEARLY RAISES. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS REGARDING- DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE BETWEEN MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ACCESS CARE AT HEALTH CENTRES VERSUS THOSE THAT DON'T- IN GENERAL ARE OUR REACTION TO THE TO ME REVISION PROPOSAL IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT IT EXPANDS UPON THE JANUARY PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW IT REFLECTS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT- YOU KNOW PROVIDES FURTHER DETAIL ON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN PERCENT RATES WILL BE FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES- YOU KNOW- IT. THERE IS SORT OF A ASK THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD EIGHT- PROPOSAL TO SORT OF- EXTEND AUDIO ONLY COVERAGE TO HEALTH CENTRES ALTHOUGH WE WOULD NOTE THAT- FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR THAT PROVISION IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME- BUT WE STILL SORT OF HAD OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT SORT OF THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TELEHEALTH AND SORT OF ITS FISCAL IMPACT AND- WE STILL SORT OF FIND THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO SORT OF SET A- PERMANENT MEDICARE POLICY AT THIS TIME I- YOU KNOW WE STILL. OF HOUS ISSUE- TO RAISE REGARDING NEED. AND IN CONVERT PARTICULARLY BETWEEN YOU KNOW THOSE AT HEALTH CENTERS IN THOSE IF NOT- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING BENEFIT WHICH- IS STILL SORT OF NOW CLOSE TO BE EXTENDED TO. TO HEALTH CENTERS- YOU KNOW AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THAT AS AN OPTION- AS FAR AS EXTENDING THAT BENEFIT OUT TO THE HEALTH CENTERS- ONE- ONE OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY HABIT IT'S ADDED SOME. DISPOSAL IS TO PERHAPS CONSIDER SETTING A SUNSET DATE TO ALLOW FOR SORT OF EVALUATION AND- YOU KNOW- FURTHER SORT OF ASSESSMENT OF WHAT MEDICARE TELEHEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE ON A PERMANENT BASIS YOU KNOW- PUTTING THIS SORT OF SUNSET. DATE IN WHICH SORT OF ALLOW FOR A REASSESSMENT OF- YOU KNOW THAT THE TELEHEALTH SITUATION BASED ON SORT OF UPDATED INFORMATION AND SO THAT IS SORT OF ONE. ONE OF ONE OPTION HAT WE WOULD- PRESENT ON THAT FRONT- THE NEXT ISSUE WILL BE SPEAKING ON IS- THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW- WE WROTE THIS UP IN IN JANUARY RELEASED AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONTINUE PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW. IN GENERAL LIKE WE DON'T HAVE SORT OF BEEN MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME YOU KNOW THERE WAS A SPRING FINANCE LETTER TO- RE DIRECT RESOURCES TOWARDS PROVIDING MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES- WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION THAT WAS SORT OF. ONE OF THE BIG. CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IN OUR ANALYSIS IN JANUARY- ONE THING THAT WE WOULD. RAISE IS THAT- GIVEN YOU KNOW SORT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING ADDED TO THIS PROPOSAL- WE SORT OF WITH A FLAG ARE ARE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT- THE CAPACITY FOR LOCAL ENTITIES TO SORT OF SUSTAIN THE ONGOING. SERVICES THAT- WOULD RESULT HAZARD- IF THEY WERE TO APPLY FOR THESE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS- WE SORT OF HAD OUTSTANDING. QUESTIONS ON THAT ON THAT COMPONENT OF IT IS WELL- THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD FLAG IS THAT THERE IS. I PROPOSAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO- FOR THE DEPARTMENTS THE HOSPITALS TO SORT OF STOP. ACCEPTING LANCER MINIATURE SHORT CONSERVE PATIENTS FROM COUNTIES AND SORT OF EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT THOSE BEDS FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL- IF THAT. WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THERE IS A- POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THIS FUNDING FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE- COULD SORT OF BE NEEDED TO ABSORB THAT. THAT POPULATION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND SO ON WE JUST SORT OF WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR LEGISLATIVE AND- CONSIDERATION- THOSE ARE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT I HAD. AT THIS TIME I THINK I'LL PASS IT ALONG TO MAKE MY COLLEAGUES JOHNSONAP. THANK YOU NOT WE WILL HEAR FROM BEN JOHNSON WITH THE L. L. HI DOCTOR AND GO INTO THE MEMBERS I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT BRIEFLY ON A FEW OF THE ITEMS DISCUSSED HERE- UNDER THE DTS PORTION THE AGENDA- STARTING WITH THE MEDIC CAL CASELOAD THAT ITEM TWELVE- JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW CONFIRMED THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REVISED DOWNWARD. ITS ESTIMATES THAT RATHER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE IN THE MAY REVISION AND NOT ONLY THAT IT'S ALSO RUDE IRVINE IT'S CHANGED SOME ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SORT OF WHICH MEDIC CAL IN ROWLEY POPULATIONS WITH GROW AT FASTER OR SLOWER RATES. NAMELY RECOGNIZING THE TRENDS IN ACTUAL CASELOAD GROWTH THAT SHOW SLOWER GROWTH AMONG SOME HIGH COST POPULATIONS SUCH AS SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND FASTER GROWTH AMONG. LESS COSTLY POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE ACA OPTIONAL EXPANSION THIS CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTION AS A RESULT AS IN ADDITION TO LOWERING THE OVERALL CASELOAD GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE- THAT THE DOWNWARD REVISION IN ESTIMATED COSTS. OVER THE FULL FOUR FULL BUDGET THAT- WINDOW HERE. OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASE ARREST MEN'S AND THE RELATED COST PROJECTIONS GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE L. A. O.'S EXPECTATIONS AND-WHILE WE NOTE THAT THERE IS SOME RISK THAT COST COULD COME IN SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS- WE DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY CASE THAT ARE RELATED TO JUST MEANS TO THE MAY REVISION. BUDGET AT THIS TIME. SO I JUST TURN TO I NUMBER. ON THE I'M- OLDER ADULTS EXPANSION AND JUST A SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMENTS THAT- THE ESTIMATES OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND- OUR OFFICE ARE NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE- ACTUALLY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE THE MAIN ONE BEING THAT WE USE DIFFERENT SORT OF AGE GROUPS THAN HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PROPOSED AND SO- THERE'D HAVE TO BE SOME MODIFICATIONS THERE. AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT IT SPECIALLY FOR THE ONGOING COST ESTIMATE WHICH IS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT SEVERAL EXTRA YEARS OF COST GROWTH WHEREAS OUR ESTIMATE- REALLY REFLECTED COSTS AS WE EXPECTED THEM TO BE ASSUMING FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE ADDITIONAL DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATIONS AND OUR ESTIMATE- BUT ARE WAITING BACK UP TO. REALLY BE ABLE TO DIVE INTO WHICH IS SOME GINS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WE DO NOW WE DO THINK THAT- DIFFERENCES IN CASELOAD ARE EXCUSE ME AND COST GROWTH COULD BE- COULD BE CONTRIBUTING AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES AROUND- I HSS COSTS. AND ULTIMATELY BOTH OF THESE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT WE WILL LOOK INTO THIS- LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER- NEXT I'LL JUST TURN TO THAT MEDIC CAL POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE. AND OVERALL WE DO FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL COULD IMPROVE MEDIC CAL PERFORMANCE MODERATE MONITORING AND CARE DELIVERY- IN ANALYSIS WE RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR RELATED TO IT. CALLING EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS WE RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW CALLIE AND ENHANCEMENTS TO REALLY MANAGEMENT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD TRANSLATE INTO IMPROVED STATEWIDE MONITORING OF HEALTH EQUITY IN QUALITY OUTCOMES- IN MEDIC CAL STATE CHANNELS THROUGH. PUBLIC REPORTING AND DASHBOARDS AND TRACKING REALLY AT A SORT OF META CAL WIDE LEVEL AND IN CONCEPT. THE PROPOSED- PROPOSED SERVICE. HAS COME OUT AT THE MAY REVISION COULD- THIS IMPROVE STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE MONITORING BY SERVING AS THE CENTRAL SORT OF REPOSITORY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA ACROSS MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS- WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- THESE INCLUDE- A FUNDAMENTAL ONE RELATED TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS REPRESENTS AN- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT THAT- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE STATE'S. I. T. PROJECT OVERSIGHT RULES ANOTHER IS WHAT IS THE FULL INTENDED SCOPE OF FUNCTIONALITY FOR EXAMPLE HOW COULD IT. POTENTIALLY INTERFACE WITH OTHER- HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE EFFORTS OR HOW. OR WHAT SORT OF DATA LINKAGES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER RETURN PROGRAMS BEYOND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS SUCH AS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR STATE AND LOCAL HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. ANOTHER QUESTION OUTSTANDING QUESTION WE HAVE IS AROUND THE ANTICIPATED TIMELINE ABOUT AROUND WHEN SERVICES ARE THE SERVICE WOULD BE OPERATIONAL AND THEN WHAT IS THE ON GOING COST OF MAINTAINING THE SERVICE. WE FIND THE GATHERING SUCH INFORMATION PRIOR TO TAKING ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL- WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE DEBATE BETTER EVALUATE THE PROPOSALS MERIT. NEXT DOWNTURN TO PASS AND- AGAIN THAT WHICH IS THE PROPOSAL TO SORT OF BUILD UP- CAPACITY AT- IN A LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES TO ASSIST WITH ENROLLING INMATES SAT IN MEDIC COW IN COORDINATING INITIATING HEALTHCARE SERVICES BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED- AND JUST NOTE THAT THAT WHILE WE- WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF EXISTING AGENCY CAPACITY. ASSISTING THESE AGENCIES IN IN THEIR CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO UNDER CALAMP LIKELY IS WARRANTED. AS WITH THE- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE PROPOSAL HOWEVER FUNDAMENTAL DETAILS RELATED TO THAT PATH PROPOSAL ARE MISSING AVAILABLE BUDGET DOCUMENTS THAT DO NOT INDICATE OUT WHICH WHICH KINDS OF AND AGENCIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING. HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED WHAT CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES WITH WOULD ACTUALLY BE FUNDING AND WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MOREOVER IT DOES SEEM THAT FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION COULD BE- UNCERTAIN WHICH- IF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DOES REFLECT THE FULL FUNDING NEEDS OF THESE CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS. EFFORTS COULD REST GOT COULD BRING SOME RISK ON SOME AND ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND BEING NEEDED SO AS WITH THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE WE JUST- RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE GATHER. SUCH INFORMATION PRIOR TO TAKING ACTION- TO MAKE AT A FULLER EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSALS MERIT. AND THEN LASTLY- JUST NEW BOB BRIEFLY ON THE- PUBLIC HOSPITAL FUNDING- WITH- WOULD BE SORT OF MORE INTEREST IN AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE RATIONALE OF THE RELIEF FUNDING OUT FOR THESE HOSPITALS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER- THIS THE FISCAL IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN ON VARIOUS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND AND. AND WONDER WHAT SORT OF DATA INFORMATION THE STATE ADMINISTRATION USE TO POINT TO- OF PUBLIC HOSTAGE DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS FIND IT FISCAL POSITION AS A RESULT OF COVER NINETEEN AND HOW THAT INFORMED OUR PROPOSAL SO- THAT'S ALL MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE I WILL BRING IT TO THE CHAIR UP FIRST AS I BEGAN MY COMMENTS TODAY I BEGAN WITH GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION AGAIN WANT TO ECHO THAT TO THE ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY. FOR HOW THEY HAVE EXTENDED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS. I LOOK FORWARD TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW SOME OF THE DISCREPANCIES AS WELL AS FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH BEN JOHNSON ON THE L. L. SO THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY AGREE WITH. THE FINANCE NUMBERS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXTEND COVERAGE TO AS MANY UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS AS WE CAN. I DO WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IF I CAN ON THEIR ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN REGARDING POPULATION HEALTH. I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE QUESTION OF THE L. A. REGARDING WHETHER-THIS IS AN I. T. PROJECT AND HOW IT INTERFACES WITH OTHER EIGHT CHINESE. THIRTY HAVING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO. WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING IT AND I. T. PROJECT AT THIS TIME IT'S REALLY WHERE WE WILL BE I'M DOING A PROCUREMENT- TO PROCURE A SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED BY MANY- COMMERCIAL PLANS AS WELL AS- OTHER ENTITIES ACROSS. THE US TODAY IN REGARD TO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PORTALS AND ANALYTICS SYSTEMS THAT CAN KIND OF HELP. ON THE DRIVING OF HOW TO INFORM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR BOTH MANAGED CARE PLANS. FOR PROVIDERS FOR COUNTIES AND FOR BENEFICIARIES AND SO HAS A MULTIPLE SERVICE OPTIONS WITHIN IT WOULD BE INCLUDING BOTH. CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS- INCLUDING YOU KNOW SOCIAL SERVICES- DDS AT PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPT ROTH. I'M TO REALLY GATHER ALL OF THE VARIOUS DATA POINTS FROM ACROSS THE RIVER IT'S MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN INTO ONE- COMPREHENSIVE SINGLE KIND OF CORAL INJURY. I'M TO HAVE THAT AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS IT REALLY WOULD BE I'M CALLING THE DATA INTO THAT SYSTEM FOR ANALYTICS ABILITY AND IDENTIFYING THOSE GAP CLOSURE PIECES ETCETERA. SEPARATENESS CARBON THAT WE WOULD BE ENSURING THAT WE CAN WORK WITH ARE INCORRECT HE COUNTERPARTS FOR INTER OPERABILITY AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE LINKAGES FOR THOSE DATA SYSTEMS TO GET THAT INFORMATION- IN TO ENSURE THAT IT IS A PORTABLE. TO OTHER SYSTEMS- AS WE EVOLVE FEET POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND GATHER ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND ONE. LOCATION IT'S A HOPEFULLY THAT HELP ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND THE SERVICE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE SOMEONE WHO SPENT TIME-DOING INFORMATICS WHILE I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IT'S EXCITING FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO AS A STATE WHEN WE ARE ABLE O. COLLECT THIS POPULATION DATA AND- I REALLY LOOK FORWARD AND THINK AGAIN THE- DEPARTMENT FOR THIS PROPOSAL. I'D LIKE. TO ASK ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN TO THE ADMIN.

AND THEN I WILL TAKE THE HANDED OVER TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR HI CHRIS EDENS AND DEBBIE DIRECTOR BRETT HAUSER TO COVER THE REMAINING OF THE PROPOSAL'S. REMAINDER OF OUR DEPARTMENT- REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND THIS IS REGARDING ITEM NUMBER THIRTY CONTENT- COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR FELONY I. S. TEASE IN THE BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED A PROPOSAL FOR D. S. H. TO ESTABLISH THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL D. S. H. WOULD HAVE CONTRACTED WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES AND PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES IN THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY SERVICES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT MAY REVISION THIS PROPOSAL IS BEING WITHDRAWN. ALTERNATIVELY IT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS INTO NEW AND EXISTING STRATEGIES ARE. PROPOSED TO EXPAND LOCAL CAPACITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEFENDANTS FOUND INCOMPETENT TEASED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. AB ITEM NUMBER THIRTY ONE THIS IS THE LAND TERMAN TREACHEROUS SHORT POPULATION AND PERSONAL SERVICES AN ADJUSTMENT. WITH THIS ITEM THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO DISCONTINUE THE STATE HOSPITALS AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR LANCMAN PATRICK SHORT LP WHERE LPS PATIENTS WHO ARE CIVILLY COMMITTED PATIENTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THESE PATIENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND AS EXISTING LPS PATIENTS TRANSITION FROM THE STATE HOSPITALS TO THE COUNTY. UTILIZE THE BEDS FOR RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY TREATMENT FOR I. S. T. UNDER EXISTING LAW COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF LPS PATIENTS AND D. S. H. IS ONE OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES WHEN IT COUNTY REFERS AND LPS PATIENT TO D. S. H. FOR TREATMENT THEY REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE USE OF THE STATE HOSPITAL BED. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL FOR THE LOSS IN REIMBURSEMENTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM COUNTIES FOR THE L. CATS PATIENTS THAT WE TREAT. SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THESE BEDS FOR AYE IS TRICKY I S. T. TREATMENT. DO YOU H. REQUEST LIMON TERM. TO MANAGE THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION. AND SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. EIGHTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING TO SURVEYS TO PATIENTS. IN THOSE BEDS. YES AGE ALSO REQUESTS A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO ADJUST ITS EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AS NEEDED SHOULD THE LPS CASELOAD BE REDUCED QUICKER THAN PROJECTED IN THIS PROPOSAL. DEPARTMENT PLANS TO ENGAGE WITH THE COMPANY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE CAIFORNIA MENTALHEALTH SERVICES AUTHORITY IN COUNTIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSITION PLAN TO THE SOUTH FACILITATE THE TRANSITION OF OPS PATIENTS TO COUNTY TREATMENT OPTIONS WITHIN THE THREE YEARS. AT THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PROPOSES TO STOP ADMITTING NEW LPS PATIENTS BEGINNING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN STARTING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO BEGIN REDUCING THE OUTCAST POPULATION FROM THE CURRENT CENSUS WITH THE TARGETED REDUCTION OF ONE THIRD OF THE LPS CENSUS EACH YEAR. THIS ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO DEDICATE ITS FULL BY CAPACITY TO FORENSIC PATIENTS AND TO REFLECT THE DEPARTMENT STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF THOSE FRIENDS OF PATIENTS. WHILE ALSO BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE WEIGHTLESS ONGOING REFERRALS AND LEGAL PRESSURE SURROUNDING INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. ON FELONY CHARGES AND REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY TREATMENT. I'M FOR THIS ITEM THERE WERE TWO AGENDA HAVE QUESTIONS THE FIRST BEING DOES THE DEPARTMENT DSHS BELIEVE THAT COUNTIES EITHER HAVE OR WILL HAVE GIVEN OTHER SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO TREAT THIS POPULATION. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THIS PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED TO ACCOMPLISH THE TRANSITION OF LPS PATIENTS OVER THREE YEARS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS WILL BE EASIER TO TRANSITION TO TREATMENT OPTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OTHERS DUE TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS MAY TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME TO IDENTIFY OR DEVELOP PLACEMENT OPTIONS. WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES TO DEVELOP TRANSITION PLANS WHICH WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE CHALLENGES PHASE TRANSITION OF UP YES PATIENTS ACCORDINGLY ACROSS THE THREE YEARS BUT STILL ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSAL BY THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. WHERE COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE RESOURCES THE PUBLIC PROPOSAL PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSORTIUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. MAY BE AN OPTION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ASSIST COUNTIES AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE OUTCAST POPULATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHERE DID IT D. S. H. BE OPEN TO CONSIDERING A LONGER TRANSITION TIME FOR THIS POPULATION IN ORDER TO GIVE COUNTIES AMPLE TIME TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FACILITIES. WE ARE OPEN TO CONSIDERING ANY FEEDBACK FROM THE COUNTIES OUT OF RELATES AS IT RELATES TO THE LPS PROPOSAL ON TIMING. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN LPS PROPOSAL IN THE IMPACT ON AYE AS TEENS. AND THE DISCONTINUATION OF LPS TREATMENT AT THE STATE HOSPITALS IS PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF I SPS. THE WAIT LIST FOR AYE IS TO USE HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC GOING FROM OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. PRE PANDEMIC TO OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED TODAY. I'M D. S. H. FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PRESSURES REGARDING PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS TO TREATMENT CRISES. SO AS WE CONSIDER ANY FEEDBACK OR REQUEST REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL WILL NEED TO CONSIDER ITS IMPACT ABOUT THE OUTCAST POPULATION. AND I. S. T. POPULATIONS. I THEN MOVING ON TO SOMETHING HAD A LITTLE BIT ON TO NUMBER THIRTY FIVE ANON RESTORE A BALL I S. T. T. BL. I'M THIS D. S. H. PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THAT NON RESTORE BOWL INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DEFENDANTS FOR WHOM THE DEPARTMENT HAS FILED A REPORT TO THE COURT. THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL READ WILL REGAIN COMPETENCY OR WHO HAVE REACHED THEIR MAXIMUM I S. T. TERM OF COMMITMENT TO D. S. H. BE RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE COUNTY WITHIN TEN DAYS. AND IF THE PATIENT IS NOT RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE COUNTY WITHIN TEN DAYS AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT TO CHARGE THE COUNTY. DAILY BED RATE AS IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO DO SO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY BUT REMAIN AND D. S. H. BAD AFTER TEN DAYS. THE STATUE CURRENTLY REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD ARE TO BE RETURNED TO COURT WITHIN TEN DAYS. HOWEVER THERE IS NOT AUTHORITY FOR D. S. H. TO CHARGE THE BILL DALY BAD RIGHT IF THEY REMAIN OVER TEN DAYS AS CURRENTLY EXISTING STATUTE FOR THAT REASON INDIVIDUALS RESTORED TO COMPETENCY. ADDITIONALLY SOME COURTS INTERPRET THAT AFTER BEING RETURNED TO COURT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE RETURNED TO D. S. H. R. REMAIN AT D. S. H. PENDING THEIR CONSERVATORSHIP INVESTIGATION. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DEEMED UNLIKELY TO REGAIN COMPETENCY THAT REMAIN IN A D. S. H. BAD LONGER THAN TEN DAYS HAS GROWN BY 12100% FROM TWENTY FOUR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. ONE AND NON RESORBABLE ISSUE REMAINS IN A STATE HOSPITAL BED IT PREVENTS THE S. H. FROM A MANY NEW I SEE PATIENTS WHO ARE AWAITING TREATMENT. THE STATUTORY CHANGES NECESSARY TO ENSURE D. S. H. MAXIMIZES UTILIZATION UTILIZATION OF ITS BED CAPACITY FOR ICY TREATMENT. TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING WEIGHTLESS FOR ICE TEAS. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT CHRISTINE'S FOR ITEMS THIRTY TWO. THIRTY THREE. REMAINING. ITEMS THIRTY TO THREE THIRTY SIX. HELLO CNN'S DIRECTOR FOR FORENSIC SERVICES- ITEM THIRTY TWO THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT- UP OR AS WE CALL IT G. B. C. T. PROGRAMS ARE THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO PARTNER WITH COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO EXPAND G. B. C. T. BED CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE AS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS WERE SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE HIGHEST HE WAIT LIST AND THE MAY REVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING AN INCREASE OF THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING AS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO SUPPORT THE COST INCREASES ENCOURAGE INCURRED BY EXISTING COUNTY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING TO ESTABLISH SEVEN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS GROWING PROGRAM. COUPLED WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS PRESENTED AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO ACTIVATE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE NEW J. B. C. T. BEDS ACROSS ELEVEN COUNTIES. UPON ACTIVATION OF THESE NEW BEDS THERE WILL BE A TOTAL OF. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY B. C. T. BEDS ACROSS THIRTY TWO COUNCILS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SEVEN POSITIONS REQUESTED WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CREATE A FORMAL PROGRAM STRUCTURE TO MANAGE THESE G. C. T. PROGRAMS. DEPARTMENT HAS NOT RECEIVED DEDICATED STAFFING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THIS NEW PROGRAM- AS WELL AS EFFORTS. TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS I THE CURRENT VOLUME OF WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH EACH EXISTING AND NEW GBC T. SITE EXCEEDS DSHS CAPACITY TO PROVIDE DEQUATE CLINICAL OVERSIGHT AND CONDUCT QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEWS OF THESE ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS. THAT'S THE END OF MY TESTIMONY AND G. B. C. T. MOVING ON. ME NEXT ITEM ITEM THIRTY THREE IS AN UPDATE ON THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM- OR I'M MAY REFER TO IT AS CPR WE ARE REQUESTING TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IS AGAIN ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS I S. T. WAIT LIST. AS OF THE MAY REVISION THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR AND FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWO ADDITIONAL CPR BEDS TO BE ACTIVATED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND FOUR AND A HALF POSITIONS ABOUT THE REQUEST PRESENTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE FUNDING REQUESTED FOR THE CBR BEDS WOULD SUPPORT HOUSING AS WELL AS CORE TREATMENT SERVICES- PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION IN START UP FUNDS FOR THESE NEW PROGRAMS. A CLINICAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND NAVIGATION SERVICES SO THIS WOULD BE THE JAIL IN REACH TO HELP IDENTIFY AS WELL AS TO- STABILIZE PERSPECTIVE CLIENTS WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN JAIL IN ORDER TO EASE THAT TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN- PRE TRIAL PROBATION SERVICES THIS HAPPENS TO BE- A BEST PRACTICE AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROPOSED FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT YEAR ACTIVATION OF TWO HUNDRED BALLOTS IN L. A. COUNTY AS WELL AS A BUDGET YOU'RE EXPANSION OF FIFTY ADDITIONAL BEDS. THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTIES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE ON GOING FUNDING FOR MORE MAJORITY OF THESE BEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN IT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS ACTUALLY INCLUDED AS PART OF THE C. C. G. P. PROPOSAL- AND THIS WAS REALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY. FOR LA'S PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROGRAM. AND SO NOW WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE CCP PROPOSAL THE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THOSE CB ARE BAD AND THE POSITIONS REQUIRED TO MANAGE THIS PROGRAM ARE NOW REFLECTED. IN THIS UPDATED MAY REVISE REQUEST. WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS PRESENTED HERE THE TOTAL REQUEST FOR THE C. B. R. PROGRAM IS THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND FIFTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION BY YEAR THREE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD SUPPORT AN EXPANSION A TOTAL EXPANSION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO NEW COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION BEDS OVER THE COURSE OF A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THAT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED FOR LA TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO FOR UP TO SEVENTEEN OTHER COUNTIES. AND A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS AS WELL AS OPERATING EXPENSE FUNDING TO SUPPORT COUNTY TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS INVESTMENT BUILDS UPON THE GOALS ORIGINALLY OUTLINED IN THE C. C. T. P. WHERE THESE NEW PROGRAMS CAN WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ESTABLISHED A VERSION. G. B. C. T. AS WELL AS OUR CONRAD PROGRAMS TO BUILD OUT A GREATER CONTINUANCE CARE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE FELONY I S. T. POPULATION. CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY ON THAT ITEM. ON. NEXT STOP IS ITEM THIRTY FOUR THIS IS THE RE EVALUATION SERVICES FOR THE FELONY I S. T. THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TEN POINT TWO MILLION IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL AS FIFTEEN POINT FIVE POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH REEVALUATION SERVICES FOR FELONY I S. T. PROGRAM ON A FOUR YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. I APPROVAL OF THIS REQUEST WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT BEGINNING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PARTNER WITH COUNTY JAILS ACROSS THE STATE TO RE EVALUATE INDIVIDUALS DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON A FELONY CHARGE. WHO BEEN WAITING IN JAIL FOR SIXTY DAYS OR MORE PENDING TRANSFER TO A D. S. H. TREATMENT PROGRAM. THIS REQUEST BUILDS OFF OF THE DEPARTMENTS EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC WHERE- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONDUCT REMOTE FRIENDS ABOUT UA ATION VIA TELEHEALTH INTERVIEWS- AND THAT IS IN BOTH THE JAILS AS WELL AS- PRISONS. THE WORKLOAD AND COST FOR THIS PROPOSAL FALL INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES- WE PROPOSED TO CONTRACT WITH A PANEL OF INDEPENDENT FORENSIC EVALUATORS- TO- IT WOULD SUPPORT STATE STAFF TO PROVIDE THAT CLINICAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO COORDINATE THE SERVICES. AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT TO THE COUNTY JAILS TO ASSIST WITH THE SANITATION OF THE TELEVISED RATIONS. ONE THIS WOULD INCLUDE A ONE TIME FLAT RATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SUCH AS LAPTOPS OR SOFTWARE LICENSES WE WOULD PROPOSE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COUNTY- AS WELL AS A FLAT RATE REIMBURSEMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR. EACH I. S. T. CENDANT THAT'S OF VALUE WAITED AND THIS PAYMENT IS INTENDED TO COVER THE JAIL STAFF TIME INVOLVED WITH ESCORTING I S. T. DEPENDENCE FROM THEIR CELL- TO THE DESIGNATED AREA TO PARTICIPATE IN A TELEHEALTH INTERVIEW- AND ORDER FOR TRANSMITTING UPDATED. INMATE RECORDS TSCH- THE CAR FRIENDS EVALUATE WILL ESSENTIALLY ASSESS. WELL IN THE JAIL AND ASSESS IF THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS RESTORED WHILE THEY'VE BEEN WAITING IN JAIL OR IS PERHAPS- NON RESTORE BOWL ON THE EVALUATORS WILL FILE A REPORT TO THE COURT ON THE STATUS OF THE PATIENT SO EFFECTIVELY WE BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT OF- PROVIDING AN UPDATE TO THE COURT- WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF COMMITMENT. IF THE PATIENT IS. DEEMS TO BE RESTORED I S. T. FORENSIC EVALUATOR WILL FILE THAT CERTIFICATE OF RESTORATION PASSED THE PENAL CODE THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO. REPORT ON IT IN ADDITION THE EVALUATOR WILL ASSESS WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR DOING VERSION OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT EVALUATOR WILL THEN INFORM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND PUBLIC DEFENDER ON AS WELL AS CONTACT ANY AVAILABLE TO VERSION OR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM- IF THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTY. JUST TO CONNECT THOSE- THOSE- INDIVIDUALS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SERVICE- AND THEN THE DESIGN OF THIS PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW D. S. H. MANAGES ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRE COMMITMENT FORENSIC EVALUATIONS UNDER THE- OFFENDERS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AS WELL AS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR STATUTES. I'M AND THEN LASTLY AFTER THE THIRD YEAR OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION DEPARTMENT WILL ASSESS THE NEED TO EXTEND ALL OR A PORTION OF THESE RESOURCES ON ON GOING BASIS- AND IF NECESSARY SUBMIT ANY BUDGET REQUEST. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX BUDGET CYCLE. CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY ON THAT ITEM. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST ITEM THIRTY SIX THIS IS AN UPDATE ON THE DIVERSION I S. T. DIVERSION PROGRAM- JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE REQUESTED ONE TIME FUNDING OF FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO EXPAND DCH DIVERSION PROGRAM. THAT'S UNDER WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE FORTY THREE SIXTY ONE- WE WERE REQUESTING TO EXPAND TO ALL OTHER COUNTIES IN THE STATE- THREE YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. CURRENTLY DSHS FUNDED TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES. TO IMPLEMENT MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS AIMED AT SERVING- THE I. S. T. OR LIKELY TO BE FOUND I S. T. ON A FELONY CHARGE- TWENTY OF THOSE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES HAVE ACTIVATED THEIR PROGRAMS. AS OF THE MAY REVISION THERE'S ACTUALLY NO CHANGE IN FUNDING COMPARED TO WHAT WE PROPOSED IN IN HE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AS PROPOSED THAT EXPANSION WILL AND ADD ENOUGH CAPACITY TO TREAT AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN. I S. T. DEFENDANTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IF ALL COUNTIES PARTICIPATE. HOWEVER I THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING- O IMPLEMENT TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION TO AMEND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE FORTY THREE SIXTY ONE. WHICH WILL APPLY ONLY TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING COUNTY DIVERSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY D. S. C. H. THOSE. AMENDMENTS ARE THOSE CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS ONE THE EXPANSION MUST SERVE THE FELONY AS HE POPULATION TRYING TO TARGET AGAIN- A SOLUTION TO HELP US REDUCE THAT WEIGHT LAST- THE SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN OUR PROGRAM WHERE- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ONE OF THREE DIAGNOSES COULD QUALIFY SO WE WOULD WANT TO. UNDER THIS NEW CHANGE WE WOULD- ALLOW ANY MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS THAT IS AUTHORIZED UNDER PENAL CODE ONE THOUSAND ONE TWENTY THREE SIX TO QUALIFY. FOR DS EACH DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND THEN ANY HOW EXISTING COUNTY PROGRAM THAT'S EXPANDED WE WOULD- WAIVES THE MATCHING FUND REQUIREMENTS- TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. ANY NEW COUNTY PROGRAM FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS OF- WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE FORTY THREE SIXTY ONE. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY ON THOSE FOUR ITEMS SO I WILL. TURN IT OVER TO. MY HOUSE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING BRETT HAUSER DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITAL SPEAKING TO ISSUE THIRTY SEVEN ON THE AGENDA- THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS REQUEST SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY THROUGH TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND SEVEN POINT- LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO ADDRESS WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASE CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN WHICH IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS REQUEST. THEY ARE REQUIRED TIME FRAMES TO RESPOND TO THE CLAIMS AND THE WORKLOAD FALLS ON DSHS STAFF.

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IF NOT I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU DIRECTOR AS WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS VEXING PROBLEM REGARDING OUR- I. S. T. POPULATIONS. I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL NUMBER NINE. WHICH IS ON COVERED CALIFORNIA MAY REVISE UPDATES WE HAVE TWO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR. OF COVERED CALIFORNIA POLICY ELIGIBILITY AND RESEARCH DIVISION KATIE RAPHEL AND BEN JOHNSON WITH THE ALLOW YOU. TO ME PLEASE BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR OF L. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE THREE COVER CALIFORNIA BUDGET ISSUES AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE- BEFORE INTEREST TO SPECIFIC ITEMS- JUST START BY NOTING THAT COVER CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT OUR THREE YEAR STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. WHICH WE BELIEVE WAS A SUCCESSFUL PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES WHICH WE NOW SEE IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. IN THE FIRST TWO BUDGET ITEMS ARE RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ON OUR STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM- SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN TO ITEM THIRTY EIGHT ON YOUR AGENDA. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN INCLUDED SEVERAL PROVISIONS TO MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH EXCHANGES LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PLAN YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW THE FEDERAL- LEVEL. INCLUDING ELIMINATING PREMIUMS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW LEVEL. IT ALSO ELIMINATED THE CAP ON FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME ABOVE THE FOUR HUNDRED- ABOUT 40% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO THAT NO INDIVIDUAL HAS TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT POINT 5% OF THEIR INCOME FOR A BENCHMARK PLAN COVER CALIFORNIA. THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ARE MORE GENEROUS THAN STATE SUBSIDIES. SO THEY EFFECTIVELY ZERO OUT THE CONSUMER STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY. ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM SUBSIDY ENHANCEMENTS FOR COVERAGE BEGINNING MAY FIRST- FOR NEW AND EXISTING MEMBERS. FOR THIS REASON THE TWENTY TWENTY STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY EXPENDITURES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PERIOD JANUARY THROUGH APRIL. HI FOR COVERAGE FROM MAY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO PLAN YOUR CONSUMERS WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS REDUCTION OF GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES FORTY FOR BOTH CURRENT YEAR IN BUDGET YEAR TERRACE LIKE THIS YEAR OWING OUT OF THE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN- THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW ON- ITEMS THIRTY EIGHT ALMOST TEN THIRTY NINE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND. AS I NOTED LAST ITEM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THE INVESTMENT IN FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET THROUGH MARKETPLACES LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA. OR THE ENHANCED AND EXPANDED PREMIUM SUPPORT UNDER THE AMERICAN RISKY PLANS TEMPORARY PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE THOSE SUBSIDIES PERMANENT. OTHER FEDERAL POLICY PROPOSALS WOULD FURTHER ENHANCE AFFORDABILITY EITHER THROUGH ADDITIONAL PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR THROUGH ENHANCED AND EXPANDED CARSHARING SUPPORT LOWER DEDUCTIBLES OUT OF POCKET COSTS. WHILE THESE FEDERAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS PROCEED COVER CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE TODAY UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE DID WORK QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW AND EXPANDED PREMIUM SUBSIDIES IN APRIL WE ANNOUNCED A SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT WILL RUN THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO BENEFIT FROM. THESE LOWER PREMIUMS AND HIGHER SUBSIDIES. COVER CALIFORNIA'S ALSO EMPHASIZING EARLY SIGN UPS BY INVESTING UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- IN MARKETING IN OUTREACH BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE TO RAISE AWARENESS AND WILL CONTINUE OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS THROUGH THIS YEAR INCLUDING DURING OUR TRADITIONAL OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD WHICH STARTS IN NOVEMBER. A WHILE WE WORK THROUGH THE OF TWENTY TO MAXIMIZE MOMENT UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. I KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE BELIEVE IT'S PRUDENT TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE FUND THAT COULD BE USED TO PARTIALLY BACKFILLED THE LOSS OF THE MORE GENEROUS FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IF THEY'RE NOT EXTENDED. OR TO POTENTIALLY SUPPORT OTHER STATE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE EXPLORED IN THE FUTURE. TO THAT END THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH A HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND. IN TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY FOR A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION INTO THE NEW FUND. THE GENERAL FUND TRANSFER AMOUNT IS EQUAL TO THE PROJECTED. AT REVENUE- FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- FOR THE SHARED. AT INDIVIDUAL SHARED RESPONSIBILITY PENALTY REVENUE- THAT IS LESS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH- WE PROPOSED TO COVER THE ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM WHICH IS THE NEXT ITEM- THE FUND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WOULD BE UTILIZED TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF THIS ITEM. HOW MOVED TO ISSUE A ITEM FOR- FORTY. ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FEDERAL PREMIUM TAX CREDITS CANNOT BE USED TO FUND THE PREMIUM AMOUNT FOR CERTAIN PORTIONS SERVICES. BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALSO REQUIRES A QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS OFFERED TO MARKET PLACES LIKE COVER CALIFORNIA MUST SEPARATELY ESTIMATE THE PREMIUM COST OF THESE ABORTION SERVICES AND THAT COST CANNOT BE LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER MONTH. FOR THIS REASON MANY COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD TO PAY A ONE DOLLAR MONTHLY PREMIUM EVEN THOUGH THE PREMIUM TAX CREDITS- WOULD MAKE THEM- OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE COVERAGE. AS I MENTIONED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ELIMINATES PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW 110050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WHO RUN BENCHMARK COVERAGE SO THIS MEANS THAT MORE COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES THAN EVER BEFORE COULD HAVE ACCESS. TO ZERO PREMIUM PLANS BUT FOR THIS ONE DOLLAR MONTHLY CHARGE FOR ABORTION SERVICES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RECENT RESEARCH ON MARKET PLACE ENROLLMENT SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A ZERO PRICE EFFECT WHERE ENROLLMENT SPIKES WHEN PREMIUMS ARE FREE AS OPPOSED TO JUST VERY LOW. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THAT RESEARCH AND WOULD ALLOW COVER CALIFORNIA TO OFFER TRUE IT'S ZERO PREMIUM PLANS. AND WE BELIEVE THIS- PROPOSAL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT TO ENCOURAGE LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE- SO SPECIFICALLY UNDER THIS BUDGET ITEM COVER CALIFORNIA'S REQUESTING AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT PROGRAM TO PAY THE ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER MONTH CHARGE FOR ABORTION SERVICES.
