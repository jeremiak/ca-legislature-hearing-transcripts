EMERGENCY ALERTS WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE EVACUATION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND SO LAYS COMMEND THEM FOR THAT WORK AND WELCOME TO TESTIFY- FIRE CHIEF DARRYL OSBY. FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY FIRE CHIEF MARK LORENZEN AND CAPTAIN DAVE GELATI- WHO IS WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE AS WELL AND ALL THREE HAVE EXPERIENCE- WITH WOLSEY SO DOMINANT I BELIEVE CHIEF LAWRENCE AND YOU WERE GOING TO BE SPEAKING FIRST. THIS BUT. OKAY PERFECT. AS AT PERFECT. THANK YOU THAT CHAIR AND A VICE CHAIR. HI WE ALL APPRECIATE YOU INVITING US HERE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR EXPERIENCES MY NAME FOR THE RECORD IS MARK LAWRENSON I AM THAT VENTURA COUNTY FIRE CHIEF I'VE BEEN WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS THE LAST EIGHT. AS FIRE CHIEF. ADVENTURE COUNTY AS YOU ALL KNOW HAS HAD MORE THAN ITS FAIR SHARE OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN RECENT MEMORY. THE FIRST ONE AS WE ALL RECALL WAS THE THOMAS FIRE THAT OCCURRED ON DECEMBER FOURTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT SIX FLEETING MONTHS IT WAS THE LARGEST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY- AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC AS FAR AS THE OUTCOME. AS A RESULT OF THAT. I WAS UP HERE TWO YEARS AGO TESTIFYING BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE AND WE WERE HERE ASKING ACTUALLY SHARING SOME DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES MYSELF IN CHIEF KOSTER BOTH AS WELL AS OTHERS. AND WE ARE ALSO ASKING AS PART OF THE DEAREST COALITION FOR MONIES FOR PRE POSITIONING WHICH YEAR- GOVERNING BODIES ALL APPROVED THANK GOODNESS. DID NOT EXPECT ME BACK TODAY I THOUGHT FIRES ARE SIGNIFICANT FIRES IN VENTURA COUNTY WERE THROUGH BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE NOT. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE THOMAS FIRE WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR A COMMUNITY ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ELEVEN TWENTY PM. WE HAD THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING WE LOST TWELVE LIVES IN INCLUDED IN THAT IS OUR BROTHER SERGEANT RON HERE THIS WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE NEXT MORNING WE ALL GATHERED UP AT LOS ROBLES REGIONAL HOSPITAL TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROCESSION TO ESCORT HIS BODY TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE. THAT WAS AT TEN AM AND AS WE ARE ALL LINED UP WE COULD FEEL IT IT'S A STARTING THE SANTA ANAS WERE STARTING TO BLOW. FOUR HOURS LATER. IT HAPPENED IT WAS THAT THE START OF THE HELL FIRE AND I WILL SAY JUST ON A PERSONAL NOTE I'VE NEVER IN MY ENTIRE CAREER BEEN ANGRY AT A FIRE THIS IS MY FIRST FIRE RIGHT EVER ACTUALLY HAD ANGER TOWARDS. BECAUSE WE WEREN'T READY WE WEREN'T READY AND THE RESPECT THAT WE WERE STILL TRYING TO HEAL FROM JUST THE EVENTS THE NIGHT BEFORE. AND THEN JUST TWENTY MEN TWENTY ONE MINUTES LATER THE WAS THE FIRE STARTED. PRIOR TO THAT WE KNEW WE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS OCCURRING AND THIS IS BEEN A RECURRING THEME WITH US THAT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT THE PAST IS NOT THE PRESENT. THIS FIRE WEATHER WAS WE HAD ANTICIPATED AND PREPARED AND WE PRE POSITIONED- AUGMENTED OUR RESOURCES AGAIN LIKE WE HAD DONE IN THE THOMAS FIRE. AND COMPARED TO OUR DAILY STAFFING WE ARE ACTUALLY 80% ABOVE OUR REGULAR DAILY STAFFING. THE NICE THING IN THE THANKFUL THING WITH THIS IS IT WASN'T JUST US NOW IT WAS. A NUMBER OF SURROUNDING JURISDICTION JURISDICTIONS THEY WERE ABLE THESE A PRE POSITIONING MONIES AND STAND UP ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. SO INITIALLY. THE HELLFIRE APPEARED TO BE THE GREATEST THREAT WHEN IT FIRST STARTED IT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY IT HAD JUMPED THE ONE ONE FREEWAY IN A MATTER OF FIFTEEN MINUTES WE HAD CLOSED DOWN THE ONE ONE FREEWAY WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN CARS ON THE FREEWAY. AND THEN AT A POINT LATER ON IN THE AFTERNOON IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE WALLS THE FIRE WAS NOW GOING TO EXCEED THE THREAT CAUSED BY THE HELL FIRE AND WE SHIFTED RESOURCES FROM THAT. YEAH THE HELLFIRE OVER TO THE WALLS A- THAT FIRE THE WILL THE FIRE WENT ON TO RAMPAGE THROUGH OAK PARK IN BELL CANYON AND INTO THOUSAND OAKS ACROSS THE WESTLAKE VILLAGE AND THEN WENT ON ITS WAY. TO AGORA IN DOWN TO MALIBU AND- THE IMPACTS WERE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. ALMOST NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO FIGHT THE FIRE. N THREE TO FIVE BILLION IN UNINSURED I'M SORRY IN INSURED LOSSES THAT DOESN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE UNINSURED LOSSES. AND SO WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THEM MAN I JUST WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE IT NEWS WE'VE WE'VE HAD THESE CHALLENGES IN THE PAST WE FOUND WAYS TO WORK AROUND ONE IS THAT THE RESOURCE ORDERING SYSTEM COMMONLY KNOWN AS ROSS. IT'S GONNA BE REPLACED IN MARCH BY IROC OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS NEW ARE MORE ADVANCED- ORDERING SYSTEM WILL BE STREAMLINED AND HELP US WITH SOME OF THE SPEED. OF ORDERING. THERE'S CHALLENGES IN THE FIRST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITH OUR CURRENT ORDERING SYSTEM. AND MY GUESS IS THERE'S BY ALWAYS GONNA BE SOME CHALLENGES. OUR INITIAL COMMITMENT WITH IN OUR COUNTY WAS TWENTY TWO ENGINES THAT'S ALMOST HALF OF THE ENGINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE COUNTY WHY THAT WAS THE INITIAL COMMITMENT ONTO. THE TWO FIRES WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR. WE ORDERED ONE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL ENGINES OR TWENTY STRIKE TEAMS AS WE OFTEN REFER TO- WHICH IS FIVE ENGINES AND A BATTALION CHIEF. AN HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER WE WERE INFORMED. THAT OF THE HUNDRED ENGINES THAT WE HAD ORDERED THIRTY OF THEM WERE CURRENTLY IN ROUTE. AND THIS IS WHERE WE ALWAYS STRUGGLING HAVE CHALLENGES BUT WE RECOGNIZE THIS UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE HAD SO MUCH EXPERIENCE IN PRACTICE THAT WE DON'T JUST SIT AND WAIT FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK. WE WORK AROUND IT. AND SO WHAT WE DO AND I TESTED TESTIFIED TO THIS TWO YEARS AGO IF WE START MAKING PHONE CALLS TO LOCAL ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS I CALL CHIEF OZ BE. IN LA COUNTY CHIEF TO RAZA CINELLI CITY AN ORANGE COUNTY FIRE CHIEF IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AND WHAT I EXPLAINED WE HAVE THIS LEVEL OF TRUST IS THAT I HAVE AN IMMINENT THREAT. HAVE IMMEDIATE LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. WHATEVER YOU CAN SEND SEND IT QUICKLY AND THEY DO. THEY WILL STRETCH BEYOND WHAT THE NORM NORMALLY MAKE AVAILABLE FOR THE STATE WIDE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S A NEIGHBOR IN IMMEDIATE NEED. AND WE ALSO HAVE THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN THAT. IMMEDIATE NEED. SUBSIST SO LITTLE BIT WE WILL RETURN THOSE RESOURCES TO THEM SO. IT IT ALLOWS US TO GO IN AND MAKE AN INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. SO I THINK THE THING TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT EVEN IF WE MAKE ROSS- IROC PERFECT IN THE FUTURE WE ARE NEVER GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR THIS SURGE FROM ADJACENT RESOURCES THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED TO DO. TO THAT END. HELLO YES IN THE FIRES GO BOARD HAS PUT TOGETHER A PILOT PROGRAM. IT'S CALLED EXPEDITED RESOURCE RESPONSE OR E. R. R. IT'S A IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM BETWEEN. VENTURA LA COUNTY LA CITY ORANGE COUNTY IN IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT MEMORIALIZES EXACTLY WHAT WE DO AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED FOR THE FUTURE IS JUST TO SAY OUT LOUD. THAT THE SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND THERE'S VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS ARE GONNA MAKE A SUCCESSFUL AND HAVING THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN. SQUEEZE RESOURCES INTO ONE AGENCY AND GET THEM BACK. IS GOING TO MAKE THIS THE SYSTEM PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL. SO THE CHALLENGES WITH THE WALLS THE FIRE. ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WAS OBVIOUSLY TWENTY MINUTES PRIOR WE HAD THE HELL FIRE AND A SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE NEED THERE WE WERE COMPETING WITH THE CAMP FIRE THAT HAD STARTED EARLIER THAT MORNING. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THOMAS FIRE WHERE WE WERE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY FIRE IN THE STATE AND WE PROBABLY ENDED UP RECEIVING TWICE AS MANY RESOURCES AS WE DID ON THE WALLS THE FIRE. SO ONE THING TO NOTICE THAT OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH AND AS I ATTENDED COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND WE HAD A LOT OF UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET CONSTITUENTS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IS THE CONSISTENT MESSAGE WAS THERE WASN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES THERE WEREN'T ENGINES IN MY HEAD NEIGHBORHOOD THERE WEREN'T ENGINES AT MY HOUSE AND- I THINK BY THE MOST POWERFUL THING WAS JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THIS EIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE WEREN'T AND THERE PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE. AND WHAT WE DO THOUGH IS WHAT WE TAKE THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE BEEN WILL TRIAGE HE SITUATION WE PUT THEM WHERE THEY CAN DO THE VERY MOST GOOD AND WE TRY AND DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. YEAH IF WE HAD HAD DOUBLE THE RESOURCES WE STILL WOULD HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. SO ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS ALSO THAT WE NEED TO DO AS WE GO FORWARD IS TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS. AS WE HAVE SAID YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NEW NORMAL OUR FIRES A SPREAD MUCH MORE QUICKLY OUR FIRE SEASON IS YEAR ROUND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS IS AS FAR AS- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN WE HAVE A FIRE AND WE NEED THE PUBLIC TO PARTNER WITH US TO- IN AN EFFORT TO BE PREPARED THAT MEANS. IT'S DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT'S HARDENING THEIR STRUCTURES IN ADVANCE OF FIRE SEASON SOMTIMES IT'S YOU KNOW JUST CHANGING UP THE ORNAMENT ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION SOMETIMES IT MEANS. GOING AND- YEAH PLATE REPLACING THEIR THEIR ATTIC VENTS SCREEN SO IT'S A SMALLER THING BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR HOMES ARE DESTROYED BY. THE AMBER ENVIRONMENT NOT DIRECT FLAME CONTACT. AND THEN IT'S ALSO HAVING A PREPARED COMMUNITY THAT PARTICIPATES IN A WRECK SAID GO PROGRAM SO THAT THEY ARE WELL PLANNED IN ADVANCE. AND WHEN THEY SEE SMOKE IN THE AIR THE PLAN IS ALREADY IN PLACE THEY HAVE ALL THEIR VALUABLES THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE THEY CAN PLACE THEM IN THE CAR AND AS SOON AS WORD COMES OUT FROM. EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE EVACUATED DELAYED. BECAUSE WE KNOW FIRE. WILL RISK A LITTLE TO A LITTLE RISK LET SABLE. WHEN LIVES ARE IN JEOPARDY WE HAVE TO RISK SO MUCH MORE. AND THAT'S ONE OF pSEEN I SOUGHT THE FIRST TIMEON THE THOMAS FIRE. IS IT TYPICALLY WHEN WE SEND OUR ENGINES UP THERE ON NORMAL FIRES WERE TRYING TO WORK ON PERIMETER CONTROL TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND WIND DRIVEN FIRES WE TYPICALLY GO UP AND START STRUCTURE PROTECTION. WHAT WE SAW ON THE THOMAS FIRE WAS THAT OUR ENGINES DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO PROTECT STRUCTURES THEY WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A LIFESAVING EVACUATIONS. ONLY PEOPLE OUT OF THE HOMES THROWING THEM IN OUR FIRE ENGINES A SAME THING WAS HAPPENING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED IN THE WALLS THE FIRE. WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW NORMAL THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND A PUBLIC THAT NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE. SOME NOTABLE SUCCESSES. THE VALUE OF PRE POSITIONING AS YOU WILL HEAR AN ADDITIONAL TERROR A TESTIMONY THAT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED I WOULD JUST LIKE TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK. YOU ALL FOR SUPPORTING THAT. NOW THAT WE HAVE PRE POSITIONING IS AVAILABLE FOR A JUST A WHOLE WIDE VARIETY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IF THEY HAVE STOOD UP ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THEIR NEIGHBORS IT DOESN'T JUST PROTECT THEIR HOME DIRT. IF I HAVE EIGHTY THAT MORE RESOURCES ON I CAN SLIDE- OUT A LOT MORE TO THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH. BECAUSE I CAN STILL PROTECT MY RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME. EN THAT SURGE THAT NEED FOR THAT SURGE FROM NEIGHBORING AGENCIES THAT'S NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY WE KNOW. THAT IT'S SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY WITHOUT A DOUBT. THE OTHER NOTABLE SUCCESSES THAT OVER A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED AND SAFELY EVACUATED THERE ARE STILL SOME LOSS OF LIFE BUT IT JUST AGAIN IN THIS MY FINAL COMMENT HAS TO DO WITH. THE INTERACTION IN COORDINATION. WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTIES AND ALSO WITH- NEIGHBORING GENCIES AND INTERNAL AGENCIES AND JUST THE SUCCESS RELATED TO THAT. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY I'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS LATER. THANK YOU TO CHIEF I THINK THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS THERE US BEYOND THE FIRE CHIEF. OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT SO. MADAM SHARES IN THE COMMITTEE OF LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AGAIN I WAS HERE TWO YEARS AGO BUT THEN I WAS SPEAKING. ABOUT HALF MY COUNTERPARTS AS THE MUTILATE SYSTEM BUT NOW SINCE THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE WOLSELEY. INCIDENT KIND OF WANT TO THANK MY COUNTERPART VENTURA COUNTY BECAUSE- THE FIRE STARTED IN HIS JURISDICTION. AND THEN BROWN INTO THE LA COUNTY- I THINK THAT WHEN YOU. AND SOME OF THE THINGS I'M GONNA APPEARS ON A GOING TO BE. REPETITIVE BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPORTANT. AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE YOUR COMMITTEE REPORT BUT I'M GOING TO. REPEAT SOME THINGS OUT OF THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPORTANT- I DO HAVE A COPY THE WHEELS THE REPORT BUT- THE TIME THAT. WAS GIVEN TO US OF THE PERMIT ME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE- THE POINTS. I THINK THAT HOW MANY READ THESE REPORTS AND YOU LISTEN TO WAS SPEAK I THINK THERE IS A PEACE IS WILLIAM MISSING AND I'M MAYBE MY UNION PRESENT WILL SPEAK TO THAT A PREFIX AFTER I SPEAK IS THE IMPACT IT HAS ON PEOPLE. THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OUR FIREFIGHTERS. I'M EVEN DOING THE WILL THE FIRE I TO TAKE A TIME OUT AND CALL. MY COUNTERPARTS DIFFERENCE IN JUST ASK HOW DO I MANAGE HIS BECAUSE FORTUNATELY FOR ME. HE DON'T THE THOMAS FIRE BEFORE AND SO. I WAS JUST OVERWHELMING TO THINK THAT WE WERE DOING SOMETHING THAT EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF OUR ORGANIZATION. AND IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE THAT. I'M EVEN WITH OUR UNION PRESIDENT WHEN WE ARE ASKING FOR MUTUAL AID. AND WE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH FR ME TO PLAY. THE REPORT SAYS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY 53% OF REQUEST ON FIELD. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITICAL TIMES OF THE FIRE. WAS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FIRE WERE BEGAN A VENTURA COUNTY. BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE SAID THE GOSHEN IT WAS LIKE EIGHTEEN HOURS. THOSE OVER 90% OF THE FIRE HAPPENED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. SO WHAT KIND OF MILK MUTUALLY RESOURCES FUNNY CAME. WHEN THEY DID COME AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH OF THEM. AS SOME FROM OUT OF STATE. SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE HELP THIS MONTH THE FIRE UP BUT- FOR THE MOST PART. WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN HAPPENED- BUT WAS HARD TO. ARTICULATE AS FAR FAR FAR TO ASKING FOR HELP IN A SCREAM FOR HELP THEY CAN'T GET IT. WAS HARD TO ARTICULATE IS WHEN YOU CAN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH ASSISTANCE AND I'M GOING TO BUY. UNION PRESIDENT TO MADHAPAR IMHO YOU TO SAY WE CAN'T DO THE WORK RIGHT CYCLE WHICH IS NORMALLY. A TWELVE ARE CYCLE THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF OUR INCIDENT. OUR FOREFATHERS WROTE. WAS FROM. ME TOWARDS WHEN A WORKER THAT NO ONE GOT SLEEP. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THAT AND A MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MINE WE SO GET OVER A THOUSAND OTHER CALLS A DAY THAT DON'T GO AWAY. AND DURING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE WHEELS THE FIRE ANOTHER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MEDICAL EMERGENCY CALLS CAME IN BECAUSE OF PEOPLE TRAPPED OR NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO SO THOSE ARE SOME SALIENT RIO. BEHAVIORAL MENTAL STRESSFUL THINGS ARE FAR FAR AS GO THROUGH. AND THEN THE AFTERMATH FROM ANY FIRE CHIEF IN THIS ROOM. IS REALLY GO OUT TO A COMMUNITY EXPLAIN WHY WE LOST HER HOME. AND I THINK THAT WE ALL SYMPATHETIC AND LISTEN TO SOMEONE LOSE THEIR HOME AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. BUT IS NOT A GOOD FEELING TO EXPLAIN IT TO SOMEONE OR FAR FAR FORCES AT WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND GET SOME OF THE RAF OF A TWO FOUR- THEIR INABILITY TO PROTECT ALL THE HOMES WHEN IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT. BECAUSE WE CANNOT PROVIDE ENOUGH RESOURCES. I AGREE WITH CHIEF RUNS IN. A WE WOULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES BUT WE NEED MORE WAS WORTH MENTIONING THAT WAS THE FIRE. WAS THAT WE DID SUCCESSFULLY EVACUATE OVER TWENTY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND WE DID HAVE TO PRIORITIZE WE MADE A PROP A PRIORITY TO FOCUS ON LIFE FIRST. AND ALL THE EXIT CORRIDORS WHEN IT JUMP TO ONE ONE FREEWAY THE ONLY EXIT QUARTER LEFT WAS PCH SO THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN. LA COUNTY VENTURA CH P. SHERIFF WAS AND THE CITIZENS WAS REMARKABLE. AND AT THE SAME TIME OUR FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE WHEN I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO MY GOVERNING BODY. WHICH WAS NOT OTHER EASY THING TO DO. WHY WE LOST OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOMES. IS THAT I TOLD THEM WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO EVERYTHING SO WE FOCUSED ON LIFE. AT THE EXPENSE OF KNOWINGLY LOSING STRUCTURES. SO ANY ADDITIONAL APPARATUS THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH STORAGE COULD HAVE SAVED THAT MANY MORE STRUCTURES. WAS WAS MENTIONED IN THE REPORT AND- I KNOW THE TOW BAR MAYBE HERE- YES MAY BE BEHIND ME I DON'T KNOW IF THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA SPEAK IS THAT. ON THE RULES LEE FIRE. ARM MOST OF THE- PUT PRINT WAS NOT LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY. OVER 40% I WAS THE DIVISION WAS STATE RESPONSIBILITY PLANS OTHER WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM AND OVER 20% WITH FEDERAL RESPONSIBLE SO THERE'S A HUGE IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTION SERVICES FOR AREAS THE FALL WITHOUT SORT OF SUMMER JURISDICTION BECOMES OUT OF OUR BUDGETS. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE LOOK AT THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE AND THE STATE 7080% OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A HUGE IMPACT I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET BUT I CAN IT NOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU. THE IMPACT HAS A MY BUDGET. IN RELATION TO TRYING TO. PROVIDE FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES TO THE- THOSE THE COUNTY. WE HAVE A ROOM WITH CAL FIREBIRD IS NOT REIMBURSE IS TO THE KNEADED NEEDS TO BE REIMBURSED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND THEN THE THOUGHT AN IDEA THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY. TO MUTILATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- MIGHT NOT GET REIMBURSED. WE DID I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT- BUT IT'S A HUGE PART OF TIMES MY ORGANIZATION- I WILL CONCLUDE. ARM MY COMMENTS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM WERE SAID BY CHEAPER RUN TO AND THEN READ THE REPORT. ON THAT FOR A LATER CONSTRUCTION WE DO HAVE A AFTER ACTION REVIEW THAT UNDER EMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. I WAS REGARD FAR APART. A LOT OF IT IN RELATION TO- PUBLIC EDUCATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IS THAT. WE REALLY DID A BETTER READY SET GO PROGRAM TO REALLY. GIVE OUR SERVICE MORE PICTURES AND MORE DESCRIPTION. ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE HOME. AND ADVANCE OF A MAJOR AIR. IN AFTER THE INCIDENT TO NOT WAIT FOR THE EVACUATION ORDER TO LEAVE EARLY. ONE OF THE CHOICES THAT WE DID FIND AS WITH THE EVACUATION. WHEN THERE'S A OR OUT. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GET MESSAGE OUT. SO PHONES DON'T WORK YOUR BONES DON'T WORK RADIOS DON'T WORK TV IS NOT WORKING IN SOME INSTANCES AS ANOTHER CONVERSATION BUT WE HAVE MULTIPLE. OF WATER PURVEYORS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE WATER OR POWER THE MERSEY BACKUP. SO IN MANY INSTANCES ARE FIREFIGHTERS IN SITUATIONS WHEN THE POWER GOES UP THEY DON'T HAVE WATER WHICH IS THE FIREFIGHTERS BEST FRIEND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WE WERE ALSO. DEALING WITH IN RELATION TO THIS AND TO THE- BUT I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THIS IS THAT. WERE APPRECIATIVE OF YUBA THE PRE POSITIONING UNITS TO HELP WE WERE ABLE TO ALLOCATE THOSE OVER TO THE HELLFIRE- WE DO HAVE AN OUTSTANDING RELATIONSHIP SO WHEN THE FIRED THE BEGINNING VENTURA COUNTY RESOURCES MY DEPARTMENT AND THE EARLY CITY WERE IN VENTURA COUNTY HELPING THEM WITH THE WILL BE FAR WHEN IT BEGAN- THE REPORT DOES SAY ONE THING. WE DO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES. BRAD AS WE NEED MORE AIRCRAFT WE MEET BETTER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WHEN. I MY ORGANIZATION WHEN I SAY WE PUT ALL OF OUR RESOURCES AT BAY. WE WENT ON RESOURCES WE STILL HAVE FAR FAR AS IT WENT TO WORK. SO I CAN ONLY SUPPLY SO MANY APPARATUS MY ORGANIZATION BUT THERE'S A COLLABORATIVE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL ENTITIES IN RELATION TO IF THEY CAN'T. HELP US WITH MUTUALLY SYSTEM AT LEAST HAVE CACHES OF EQUIPMENT. THAT THEY CAN HAVE STAGED AND MUNICIPALITY SUCH AS OURS I'M SURE THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES THERE YOU HAVE FIREFIGHTERS COMING TO WORK THAT WANT TO WORK. BUT THE MUNICIPALITY PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THEM. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT FURTHER SO I WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH MORE TIME I KNOW MY- COUNTERPARTS APPEARS HELPING TO SAY BUYS ONCE AGAIN. INCLUDES IS REALLY THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO US TODAY IN YOUR COMMITMENT TOWARD THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU CHIEF. CAPTAIN READING. WHEN I HEAR THE WORDS CAPTAINS SO MANY CHIEFS IN THE ROOM I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE. MY NAME IS DAVE GELATI AND- A FIRE CAPTAIN AT THE LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS MY THIRTY SECOND YEAR AS A PAID PROFESSIONAL FIRE FIGHTER. OF HELL THE RANKS OF PARAMEDIC. FIREFIGHTERS ENGINEER AND CAPTAIN I ALSO WHERE ANOTHER HOT HERE TODAY ON THE UNION PRESIDENT OF THE LA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS- UNION LOCAL TEN FOURTEEN AND IFF LOCAL I'M REPRESENTING A BRIAN RICE WHO HEADS UP THE STATE UNION AND I SIT ON THAT BOARD. OF BEEN ON THAT BOARD FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS HAVING SAID THAT I ALSO WORK FOR DURALAST BE SO I CAME IN WITH MY BUSTED. I WE DO HAVE TRUE COLLABORATION- BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT AS YOU WILL SEE THAT THE SPIRIT OF. WITH IN A STATE ORDERING SYSTEM THAT IS CUMBERSOME BUT IS PROBLEMATIC IF YOU LET JUST THE SYSTEM ITSELF. BE USED TO ORDER RESOURCES AND SHARE RESOURCES WE HAVE TO HAVE THE HUMAN ELEMENT. OF THE FIRE CHIEFS THE UNION PRESIDENTS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT DOING THE WORK THAT THEY REPRESENT- EMBEDDED IN THAT SYSTEM AS WELL. I TO THINK THROUGH SOME OF THE DECISIONS WHEN WE'RE SHORT STAFFED. YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF STATISTICS TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF TO GIVE ME A TON OF POINTS TO TALK ABOUT HERE AND I'M NOT GONNA USE ANY OF THEM THE- IT. THE MY MOTHER. MY AND SPRAY. ONCE YOU TO. TAKE A MINUTE AND A- WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU. AS A LINE DUTY FIRE CAPTAIN I WORK IT FOR STATION SIXTEEN AN ALLY IT'S IN THE WATTS WILLOWBROOK AREA. UNDER A- RESOURCE STEREO OF LA COUNTY. I HAVE TWO ENGINES THERE AND PARAMEDICS WATTAGE AND SIXTEEN ENGINE NINE AND PARAMEDICS WHAT SIXTEEN. SO WELL READ STATION I'M AN ENGINE NINE IT'S WHAT'S CALLED US. TEAM GEN. AND FOR ALL OF OUR AGENCIES WE HAVE. UNITS THAT ARE PRE DESIGNATED A STRIKE TEAM ENGINES DURING THE WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH IS ALL YOU'RE NOT. AS A CAPTAIN I COME IN IN THE MORNINGS AND A SPECIAL. AS YOU WERE SAYING YOU WHEN WE FELT THE WIND CHANGE IN THE MORNING AND WE WERE JUST COMINGOFF OF THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING. WICH AFFECTED LA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS WHO LIVE IN THAT AREA WHOSE KIDS WERE AT THAT NIGHT CLUB THAT NIGHT THINKING WHAT ELSE CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN. AT SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. THE CAMP FIRE IGNITED AND AS WE WERE BUSY WATCHING THAT ON TV THINKING HOLY SMOKES. I HOPE WE DON'T GET A FIRE DOWN HERE AND OF COURSE. THE HELL FIRE STARTED AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE WE'LL SEE FIRE. I WAS ON THAT STREET TO MENTION. THEM ALL OF OUR CREWS WERE DISPATCHED OUT TO PREPARE FOR THE WILL THE FIRE WE HAD NO IDEA HOW BIG THAT FIRE WAS GOING TO GROW. WE THOUGHT WE HAD ENOUGH RESOURCES WE GOT IN PLACE. ON THE INTERIOR SIDE OF THE ONE ONE FREEWAY YOU BOTH KNOW THAT FREEWAY. YEAH YOU THINK YOURSELF IT'S NOT GOING TO JUMP THE ONE ONE FREEWAY AND GO ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN IS IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR- AND- WE HAD ALL OUR RESOURCES. POSITIONED AND EVERYBODY WAS IN ACTIVE FIREFIGHT. THERE WAS FIRE EVERYWHERE AND LET ME GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. AT THE PEAK FIRE. JUST PICTURE CITY BLOCK IN SACRAMENTO. PICTURE A FIRE RAGED. WITH EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WINDS DRIVING IT TOWARDS THE OCEAN. PICTURE THAT FIRE BEING THIRD TEAM MILES LONG. THIRTEEN MILES WIDE AND A BUNCH OF TINY HUMANS MEN AND WOMEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HUMANS IN THE WAY THAT FIRE TRYING TO HOLD BACK A THIRTEEN MILE WIDE FIRE FRONT. IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND WE SAW IT JUMPED THE ONE ONE FREEWAY. I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT I HEARD ON THE RADIO. WE HAD ONE OF OUR- WILDLAND FIRE EXPERT SUPERVISORS WHO WORKED IN THE CAMPS AS A FOREMAN HE WORKED ON THE ENGINES PROMOTED THROUGH THE RANKS. I'LL NEVER FORGET HE KEEP THE MIKE. AND I HEARD THE FOLLOWING WORDS. LA AND THAT'S OUR DISPATCH CENTER. AND I'M GONNA BRING TO LIGHT WITH THE DISPATCHERS WENT THROUGH AS WELL. LA DIVISION GROUP SOUP WHATEVER'S TITLE WAS ON THE FIRE THAT THEIR DIVISION GROUP SOUP. WE HAVE FIRE THAT IS CROSS THE ONE O. ONE. AND IS GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN I NEED AND THERE WAS A PAUSE AND HE SAID THE WORDS. I NEED FIFTY STRIKE TEAMS. FOR THOSE F US IN THE BUSINESS WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING FIRE AND SAID. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY. THE TRIED ORDER FIFTY STRIKE TEAMS. NOBODY ORDERS FIFTY STRIKE TEAMS YOU CAN'T GET IT. IF YOU ORDER TO STRIKE TEAMS AND A STRIKE TEAM IS FIVE ENGINES WITH THE SUPERVISOR. SO TO STRIKE SEEMS TO BE TENANTS AS HE ORDERED FIFTY STRIKE TEAMS. AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE HAD LOST HIS MIND. LATER WHEN I TALK TO ME SAID I COULDN'T THINK OF WHAT ELSE TO SAY. OTHER THAN TWO ORDERS SO MANY STRIKE TEAMS BUT I WOULD CATCH EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION ON THE RADIO AND HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY IN THE DECISION MAKING ROOMS ATTENTION TO SAY WE NEED RESOURCES. BOTTOM LINE WE COULDN'T GET THEM. WE HAD NEIGHBORHOODS BURNING. AS WE WERE PULLING PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES WE WERE NOT TRYING TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. WE WERE NOT TRYING TO SAVE PROPERTY. WE WERE TRYING TO SAVE LIVES. PERIOD AND WE WERE DEALING WITH RESIDENTS THAT THOUGHT THEY COULD STAY BEHIND. AND DEFEND THEIR HOMES IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT WE KNEW PEOPLE WERE TUCKED BACK IN THE INTERSECTIONS IN THE ALLEYS OF THE HILLS. EMBEDDED IN THE HILLS OF MALIBU IN VENTURA. PEOPLE LIVE WAY BACK IN THERE AND THEY WEREN'T LEAVING. SUCH A HOT HAPPENS THEY CALL OUR DISPATCH CENTER. LAST YEAR I GOT TO BRING A COUPLE OF MY DISPATCHES APPEARED TO TESTIFY ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER BILL WITHIN THE TESTIMONY MY DISPATCHER BROKE DOWN AND GOT US ALL CRYING IN THE ROOM AND SHE SAID I WAS TAKING CALLS. AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE CRY. AND SCREEN. AND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE ARE. B. PLEADING FOR US TO SEND RESOURCES TO HELP THEM. AND SHE SAID I COULD SEND THEM ANYBODY. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE RESOURCES SHE HAD A BIG IMPACT ON ME AS YOU CAN TO. WE SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING OUR DISPATCH CENTERS. OR FIREFIGHTERS OR THE CITIZENS IN YOUR DISTRICTS IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT WE PROTECT AND SERVE. IN HARM'S WAY TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN. BE EFFECTIVE IN SAVING LIVES I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK OF ALL THE MUNICIPAL AGENCIES CAL FIRE FOR SERVICE AND EVERYBODY IN THOSE INITIAL STAGES OF THAT FIRE. BECAUSE TO EVACUATE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND GOD BLESS YOU ONLY HAVE THREE DS WE HAD NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE BURNED. WE HAD HOMES LIVES DESTROYED WE LOST A LOT OF PROPERTY BUT TO MOVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY OF THIRTEEN MILES OF FIRE. WITH EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WINDS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. WAS REMARKABLE. SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING TO YOU A LITTLE VISION OF WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE FIRE TODAY WHEN I GOT UP TO COME HERE I LOOKED IN MY LOCKER AT THE STATION I SAID I BETTER GRAB MY UNIFORM AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE WITH ALL THE CHIEFS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD LOOKING GUYS. THEY WERE ALL THE FAT FROM ST I HAVE A- A BUT I DECIDED TO GRAB MY BILLION FORM TODAY IN THE PAST I HAVE ONE. WITH PURPOSE I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID OH MAN. THERE ARE. THIS IS THE PASSED THE WAR FOR THE FIRST THIRTY. SIX HOURS ON THE WAS A FIRE. WHICH I COULDN'T STAND WHERE AND MANY MORE. AND GOT ITEM. AN APPARTEMENT TODAY JUST TO DRIVE SOME MOTIVATION TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE FIRST THIRTY SIX HOURS WERE LIKE. WE HAD NO REST WE HAD NO FOOD WE HAD NO WATER WE WERE SELF CONTAINED AND WE WERE GOING FROM. HOUSE TO HOUSE FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD. CARRYING PEOPLE OUT ON OUR BACKS GETTING THEM OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS OR MORE THERE WAS NO RELIEF BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE BODIES WE DID NOT HAVE ENGINES WE DID NOT HAVE RESOURCES TO ROTATE OUT. AND EVERYBODY STAYED ON THE LINE AND DID A GOOD JOB. ALONG THOSE LINES LATER IN THE FIRE WHEN I PUT ON MY UNION HAT. I GOT TO RUN THE PEER SUPPORT TRAILER AT THE CAMP AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE RESOURCE DOUBT. FIREFIGHTERS WHO RAN ON THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING IN FACT. PACKED THEIR GEAR AND ONE ON THE FIRE WITHOUT A MINUTE TO GRIEVE. THEY STARTED GRIEVING ABOUT TWO WEEKS INTO THE FIRES AND WE HAD TO DO WITHOUT. BUT THE FIRE CHIEF CALLED ME SAID. WE'RE OUT OF ENGINES BUT WE GOT BODIES. WHAT CAN WE DO AND WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT AND- IT CAME TO US IN A CONVERSATION. I THINK WE'RE OVER TIRED. I SAID WELL THE BODIES ARE GETTING TIRED THE ENGINES IN THE EQUIPMENT. THEY CAN KEEP RUNNING. WHAT IF WE LEFT ENGINES IN PLACE AND WE PUT TWO SHIFTS OF FIREFIGHTERS PER ENGINE. AND WE JUST STARTED ROTATING A MOUNTAIN CAMP WE HAVE THREE SHIFTS ON THE DEPARTMENT SO SENSUAL AT THAT POINT ONE SHIFT COVERED ALL THE AREAS THAT WE STILL HAD TO PROTECT. IN THE LA COUNTY AREAS SOME MASSIVE. TWO THOUSAND. WAS IT THANK YOU IT'S A IT'S A LARGER VOTE COUNT AND WE HAD TO PUT OUT ONE SHIFT IN THE STATIONS AND THEY STAYED THERE FOR TWO WEEKS OR OR LONGER AND THEN WE TOOK OUR OTHER TWO SHIFTS AND WE ASSIGN THAT. AND IF I AM THEM TO THE- TWO SHIPS THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AND OUR AGENCY AND WE WERE ABLE TO ROTATE THE WORKERS ON TO THE MACHINES AND BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF WE HAD MORE PENSIONS. WE COULD PUT THOSE FIREFIGHTERS IN SERVICE A FEW OTHER THINGS I'M GONNA STAY AYE ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION ARE YOU HERE FROM SOME FIRE PREVENTION TODAY THEY DO AMAZING WORK OUT THERE ON WOODS IN ORDINANCES WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF PULLING PEOPLE TO CLEAR THEIR ERROR. OF NATURAL VEGETATION TO PROVIDE- BUFFER FOR THE FIRES AND TO HAVE A PLAN TO LEAVE WITH DONE GREAT. AND THEN WE'VE ALLOWED THEM TO PLANT STICKS OF DYNAMITE. IN THEIR PLANNERS SURROUNDING THE HOUSES AND WHEN YOU SEE THE ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION GO UP. IT'S AMAZING ALL THIS GOOD STUFF IN PLACE AND THE ORNAMENT OF IT VEGETATION. CAN TAKE OUT A HOUSE BECAUSE IT IGNITES MORE READILY THAN EVEN THE NATURAL VEGETATION SO SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING IS ON ORDERING- THAT THIS ORDERING SYSTEM BACK AT THE STATION FAR WE HAVE COOPERATING AGENCIES AND YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO COOPERATE LOCALLY AND WE DO THAT WE GET ON THE PHONES WE SHARE RESOURCES. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE ONE AGE ZERO FIVE PARTS. AND THAT FIRE IS BY IN DIRECT OF OTHER A- WHETHER MINUTE. OR A THE DIRECTION BUT AND STATE. OR FOR AREA. WE HAVE A FIVE COMMAND. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HAVE DECISIONS BE MADE SOMETIMES WITHOUT THAT INPUT. AND IN FACT WE THINK AT THE STATION FIRE HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO GET MORE STATE RESOURCES- FROM US FOREST SERVICE IN AIRCRAFT AND- THINK OF THE WORD THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY. WE WERE COMPETING FOR SIR THIS. IS AMAZING THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM. THAT WE HAVE TO COMPETE A COMPETITION. FOR RESOURCES BETWEEN EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. THAT MEANS SOMEBODY'S GONNA WIN AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LOSE AND THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE ON THE COMPETITION IF THEY'RE FACING AN INCIDENT THAT HITS THE LIVES AND PROPERTY ARE GOING TO BE LOST. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU IS THAT. THE PRE POSITIONING MONEY. I'VE BEEN A PRETTY TESTIFIED THAT TO A GOD SEND OF A PLAN. WE ARE STILL IN PRE RECESSION STAFFING LEVELS.WE'VE CLIMBED OUT OF THE RECESSION WE BUILT OUR ECONOMIES BACK THE STATE IS HEALTHIER WE NEED TO RE EXAMINE RESOURCES. STAFF WHAT. AND THE MONEY. IN THE POSITION MONEY. A BACK TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS SO THAT MUNICIPAL AGENCIES CALIFORNIA THE FORRESTER. IN FACT CAN PARTICIPATE ROBUSTLY IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE SMALL MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE SENDING THE RESOURCES OUT EVEN LARGE AGENCIES WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE DON'T GET REIMBURSEMENT WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW IT OTHER AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO BACK FILL OUR- MYSTIC INS. AND PROTECT THE IN AREAS. ON THE SHOOTING MONEY WE LOOK AT ALL THE WITH AND WE DO OUR BEST TO PUT RESOURCES IN THE AREAS WERE FIRE MIGHT STRIKE AND I CAN TELL YOU WHEN IT DOES STRAP WE HAVE AN IMMERSION OF RESOURCES. THERE WERE ANY OTHER FIRES THE TWO DAYS THAT NOBODY WILL EVER HEAR ABOUT. IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED. THAT ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE REPRESENT IN THIS ROOM INCLUDING MYSELF ON THE LINES. THAT WE PUT THOSE FIRES OUT VERY. QUICKLY BECAUSE WE HAD THE RESOURCES WE HAD THE AIRCRAFT WE HAVE THE COOPERATING AGENCIES. SO WITH THAT I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME IN FACT BOTH. THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE REPRESENTED.

AND WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND BEYOND THIS REALLY IS BEEN GOING ON FOR MUCH LONGER PERIOD IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS SONOMA COUNTY NAPA LAKE AREA ON THE BALLOT FIRE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAD THE- RESUME FOR OURS. MANY THEY- AND WE FORWARD TO SEVENTEEN AND WE HAD THE TUBS FIRE. A REMINDER THE TOUCH FIRESTAR IN COUNTY TWELVE MILES AWAY FROM SANTA ROSA WITHIN THREE HOURS IT WAS IN SANTA ROSA. IN WITHIN SIX MORE HOURS- THE FIRE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED ALL FOR PROGRESSION BUT IN THAT TIME BURNED ABOUT FIFTY SIX HONOR BUILDINGS. IT IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FIRE THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH- I WILL TELL YOU AT- AT BY TWELVE THIRTY AT NIGHT WE HAD SEVENTY EIGHT STRIKE TEAMS REQUESTED. FORTY WERE FOR THE INCIDENT WHICH WAS THE TUBS FIRE WHICH STARTED IN NAPA. AND ADD THE REMAINDER- WAS ORDERED THROUGH CINEMA COUNTY. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE RESOURCES SHOWED UP AFTER SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN MOST OF THE DAMAGE WAS DONE. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED IS WE HAVE THE BEST MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. WE REALLY DO. BUT IT'S GOOD FOR TWELVE TO THIRTY SIX HOURS OUT ON THOSE NO NOTICE EVENTS THAT THAT WOULD LOOK AT TODAY. AND A LOT OF THESE FIRES THAT ARE START LEAST IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS ARE STARTING AT NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN. PEOPLE ARE STE. MOST FIRST TIME. FOR FIRE AND IN THE IN THE NEXT EXAMPLE TALK TALK ABOUT A MINUTE THE KINCAID WE'RE THE MIDDLE OF A P. S. P. S. MULTIPLE PSP **** WHICH MET.

AT THE FIRES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING A BURNING HOTTER FASTER THEY'RE NOT LAYING DOWN AT NIGHT THEY'RE BURNING- JUST AS GOOD AT NIGHT AS THEY ARE- IN IN THE DAYLIGHT- JUST LAST OUT OF MY HOUSE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL ORANGE MOON COMING UP THE WIND WAS BLOWING OUT MY BACK IT WAS WARM AND I'M LOOK AND IT'S FAIR. TENTH RIGHT. THANK GET A SMALL NUMBER IT MADE ME STEP IN THINK WHAT THE CLOCK AND I MISS THIS DOES FEEL RIGHT. FOR FEBRUARY SO IT DIFFERENT THERE AND WE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND THE MUTUAL AID SO.

PREPAID RESOURCES WE WHAT HAD ONE OH YES RIGHT TEAM FROM THE REST PRE POSITION THEY ALL WENT TO THE FIRE. DID SOME GREAT WORK- WILL CAL FIRE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE INCIDENT AND THEY THEY ORDERED A QUICK MEANT TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY HAD- AND IT WILL THE ONLY FIRE IN TOWN RIGHT. THAT ALLOWED IT TO BUILD IT AND THE TEAM BILLS FROM RESOURCES IN- AND- PLAN WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE FOR THE TUBS FIRE WILL SOME OF THESE EXAMPLE OTHERS EXAMPLES. WAS JUST NO TOP. WE THIS TIME. AND NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE WE HAD A. IN A SMALLER AIRCRAFT BUT IN THIS. WE ALL EVACUATED TO SEE PILLS BURGER TOWN A WIN. THE GREATER MONEY SNOW MACAU I THINK OF UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE BACK WAITED WE HAD ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WE EVENT WHAT TWENTIETH. EIGHT ON FOR. RIGHT SO WE HAD AN THIS AND PROBABLY FOR THOUSAND. PEOPLE FAIR CAMP OR ELITE ASSIGNED TO THE CAN'T. WHEN YOU GOT A SPLIT UP THEY CAN BE OUT ON FIERY SHIP WORK RIGHT YOU NEED SO FOR THE DAY. BUT WHEN THEY WERE BURNING OF THE COMMUNITIES. WERE AND I WAS PARTY UNIFIED COMMAND WITH TEAM SIX. THERE WAS A POINT WHERE LIKE IT WE EITHER GET THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE SLEEPING IN CAMP UP AND WE GET A MEMBER OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE WE GOT FIRESTARTER BURN AND HILLS BERGEN IN WINDSOR. OR I GOT A REACH OUT AROUND- YES AND GO TO MY REGION AND COUNTIES AROUND ME TO GET RESOURCES IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S STARTING THE IMPACT THE TOWN F WINDSOR. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID I HAD- CHIEF ROACH ON THE LINE AND SAID CAN YOU CAN YOU SPARE ANY EQUIPMENT AND GOES LET ME GET BACK WE WERE START HAVE POP UP ON OUR BECAUSE THE WILL OF IT WAS. A ONE. OUR MARIN COUNTY. SENATE A STRIKE TEAM PLOY ARE WE OR ANOTHER STRETCHING FOR LOCAL CAN LOCAL UNITS WITH INSTANT COUNTY AND WE PUSH THEM ALL INTO WINDSOR WITH THE OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT IS A SIGN AND THEY DID GREAT GREAT WORK AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IT. IT WAS AN AGO ATION BETWEEN THE UNIFIED COMMANDERS MYSELF PART OF IT IS A THESE RESOURCES COME AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASSIGNED TO THE TO THE ANSWER THEY BECOME OURS SEC NO WE CAN'T DO THAT THESE ARE SURGE UNITS TO HELP WITH THE FIRE WHEN A TRUCK STOP THIS FIRE SO DOESN'T BURN ANOTHER COMMUNITY AND ONE AT THREE DOT GO BACK IN BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE COMMUNITIES WE NEED TECH WE HAVE A LOT OF ME. CAN'T YOU CAN. EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF THE WIND CHANGES WE HAVE A PRETTY IDEA OF WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT YOU NEVER KNOW TELL IT'S GOING TO HAVE. AND WE YOU THE SURGE PLANS THE CAN CADE PROBABLY THREE DIFFERENT TIMES- VERY SUCCESSFULLY. AND THE REASON I BRING IT UP IT'S A LOT LIKE WHAT CHIEF LEARNS AND SAID IT'S THIS THIS. FORMULA FOR GETTING RESOURCES AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE AS- A QUICK MINUTE SONG AND- YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH ALL THE ENTITIES THAT YOU NEED ALL THE- IS THAT YOU NEED. SO USE THESE FORCE TO SURGERY. DEAL THE THREAT. AND TWELVE HOURS WE CENTER HOME. NOW I UNDERSTAND BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACCOUNT NIGHT FOR YES CAL LOOK GOVERNMENT I WE HAD A WORKS ALL OF THAT BUT WE USED THE MAJORITY OF IT IS MASTER MUTUAL AID WHICH MEANS THIS MUTUAL AID. THEY COME THEY DO THEY WORK TO GO HOME AND AS PART OF THE AS BEING OPERATIONAL COORDINATOR I'D HELD A CONFERENCE CALL. FOR WITH ALL THE FIRST PERSON THEY SAID HEY WE THIS WE HAVE THAT MY HISTORIC ONE EVENT. TWENTY ACRES ON FIRE I NEED IT UP UP AS MUCH. IT MAY COME. OR IT MAY COME LATER TO. WE WON'T KNOW BUT WE NEED EVERYONE READY. AND I WILL TELL YOU CINEMA COUNTY SET UP IN A THEY- THEY- WHEN WE MADE THE ALL CALL THEY HAD FIFTY ENGINE CERTAIN- REAL CLOSE TO WHERE THEY CONCERT. RIGHT SO. IT DOES WORK- BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR. ALL OF US IN THE PROFESSION- YES CAL FIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO KINDA RANGEL THAT RIGHT BECAUSE- WE TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY WHAT DOES IT MEAN WE GAVE EVERYONE A TALE MORE BRIEFING. WE MADE SURE EVERYONE HADTHE COMMON. FEEL COMMUNICATIONS WE TIED IN WITH THE DIVISIONS OR WHOEVER THEY NEEDED TO ON HIGHER. THAN THEIR WORK. AND THEY WERE RELEASED IN ONE HOME. THAT IT WORKED THIS TIME AND I THOUGHT IT WORKED REALLY WELL I THINK SOUTHERN. DOESN'T SEEM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO GO BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET THE RESOURCES FAST ENOUGH- AS FAR AS THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IF WE JUST WE DON'T KNOW HOW. BIG HOW FAST IT'S MOVING MOST OF THE TIME AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL RIGHT WE HAVE SATELLITES WE HAVE DRONES AS DRONES WE HAD IT ON THE CAN CAN I THINK IT HAPPENED ON THE SECOND THURSDAY. WE NEED IT OUR FIRST DAY RIGHT SO WE CAN MONITOR. IF YES IS LOOKING AT THAT INFORMATION NOW WE GOT SIGNIFICAN FAR WE NEED TO START PUSHING RESOURCES AND NOW. INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR TED TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS. THE TUBS FIRE INDICATE FIRE WERE CAL FIRE INCIDENTS. SO YOU TALK ABOUT UNIFIED OR REPORTS YOU PUT IN ORDER FOR FORTY UNITS A GOES TO CAL FIRE. CAL FIRE IS GETTING INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS THEY HAVE TO PROCESS. THE STRIKE TEAMS. GOES THE MORE POPULAR DAHLE FOBS. RIGHT BUT BEFORE EVEN GOES THE YES SO CAL FIRE NO YES WELL THEIR PARTNERS. THEIR SEPARATE CAL FIRE HAS ITS MISSION- YES HAS THEIR MISSION. SO WHAT ARE THOSE TWO YEARS AGO. HE HAS LIKE LOOK AT THEIR AN ORDER FORTY STRIKING HAVE GO CAL FIRE WEATHER CAL FIRES IN OR NOT AND THE OTHER GOOD YEAH. TO GET THE IN THE- THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WILL BURN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY QUITE. AS MUCH. AS RIGHT BUT- FOR THE ONE IS BURNING IN THE COMMUNITIES SEC WE HAVE TO BE. DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH THIS IS HOW WE GET RESOURCES IN. IT TAKES TIME. I TOTALLY GET THAT EVERY UNDER. THAT WE JUST WANT TO. IT IS. AS GOOD AS WE CAN FOR THE CITIZENS. OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THE COAST. WE ARE ALL IMPACTED WITH TODAY'S WEATHER WERE ALL IMPACTED WITH THE FIRES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING. IN WE HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT. WE BUT WE NEED HELP DOING THAT. AND I THINK EVERYONE SEES THE VALUE THAT IS JUST HOW DO WE BREAK DOWN AND MAKE IT WORK THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SAFE. EVERYONE IN WHAT BUT ALL ALL STOP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. THANK YOU TO. THE CHIEF RENDON WHO'S GONNA BE MAY PRE PREPARE REMARKS OF A SHE FOR A. I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE RUMOR OF JAY ROACH IN THE REC GOOD AFTER. I AM DAVID ROACH I AM THE FIRE CHIEF OF THE TO FIRE TO. I ALSO SERVE AS CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA METROPOLITAN FIRE CHIEFS WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE SIXTEEN LARGEST IN THE MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE. MY REMARKS TODAY SELECT AN ADDITIONAL ROLE I PLAY AS A CAL- YES REGION TO FIRE AND RESCUE COORDINATOR. THE POSITION I AM ELECTED TO BUY FIRE CHIEFS FROM SIXTEEN COASTAL COUNTIES FROM MONTEREY COUNTY TO THE OREGON BORDER. REGION TWO IS ONE OF SIX MUTUAL AID REGIONS THAT FUNCTIONALLY CONNECT CAL- YES TO OPERATIONAL AREAS. YOU CAN THINK OF OPERATIONAL AREAS AS COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THEY'RE STRUCTURED. WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF THE TAHOE BASIN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE SIX REGION COORDINATORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING REGIONAL FIRE AND RESCUE RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND THE COORDINATION OF MUTUAL AID WITHIN THE REGION AS WELL AS FILLING ORDERS TO OTHER REGIONS. COORDINATORS ALSO ORGANIZE STAFF AND EQUIP THE REGION COORDINATION DISPATCH CENTER. THIS IS USUALLY DONE AT THE HOST AGENCIE COST. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF MUTUAL AID. WE PROVIDE THE STATE WITH NOT ONLY A FIRE AND RESCUE REGION COORDINATOR. BUT ALSO REGION COORDINATORS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES. THIS ADDITIONAL BUT NECESSARY DUTY PLACES AND UNFUNDED BURDEN ON THE HOST FIRE DEPARTMENT LIKE ALAMEDA COUNTY FIRE. WE MUST STAFF FOR POTENTIAL ADVANCE AND TRAIN ON SYSTEMS PROVIDED BY THE STATE SO WE ARE ALWAYS READY. FOR THESE REASONS IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FIND AGENCIES WHO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OR OTHERWISE WILLING TO BE A REGION COORDINATOR OR AN OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR. IN REGION TWO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO FIND AN AGENCY THEY CAN COMMIT TO FUNCTIONING AS OUR OWN BACK UP. BE THAT AS IT CAL FIRE LIKE NAPA UNIT IS THE DESIGNATED BACK UP WHICH BRINGS ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES. NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY HAVE BEEN A VERY BUSY UNIT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THE DOOR CALLOW YES CAL FIRE ROLE LEADS TO EXCEPTIONAL WORKLOADS FOR ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED DISPATCH CENTERS. DURING INCIDENTS A REGION COORDINATION DISPATCH CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISPATCHING ALL CAL- YES AND LOCAL FIRE AND RESCUE RESOURCES. WITHIN THE REGION TO MAJOR MUTUAL AID OPERATIONS OR FIRES SUCH AS THOSE DISCUSSED EARLIER. DISPATCH CENTERS IN THE INCIDENT ARE OFTEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE INCOMING CALLS IN DISPATCH DUTIES WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REACH OUT TO THE REGION COORDINATOR FOR HELP. DURING THE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES MY DISPATCHERS COULD NOT EVEN REACH THE LOCAL OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATION CENTERS IN NAPA AND SONOMA TO PROVIDE RESOURCES. FROM THE BAY AREA. CALIFORNIA LAKE NAPA UNIT WAS OVERWHELMED WITH CALLS FROM THE PUBLIC AND RESOURCE ORDERS THE FIRST OFFICIAL ORDER FILLED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAME SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE FIRST REQUEST FROM A FIELD INCIDENT COMMANDER TO THEIR LOCAL DISPATCH CENTER. STILL NOT ENOUGH IN HINDSIGHT OPERATIONAL AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO CONTRA COSTA AND ALAMEDA SEND STRIKE TEAMS FIVE ENGINES AND CHIEF OFFICER BEFORE THOSE ORDERS WERE EVEN RECEIVED. EVENTUALLY THOSE ORDERS CAME THROUGH THE SYSTEM BUT WE SIMPLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT INTO THE OFFICIAL ORDERS CAME AND- UNFORTUNATELY. THE CURRENT RESOURCE ORDERING AND STATUS SYSTEM OR ROSS AS IT IS CALLED IS CUMBERSOME AND TOO SLOW TO ADDRESS THE RESOURCES BEING ORDERED AT THE ONSET OF THESE FAST GROWING FIRES. IT'S A THIRTY YEAR OLD FEDERAL SYSTEM DESIGNED MORE FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AS YOU'VE HEARD THE SLOW ROSS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED SOME LOCAL AGENCIES BIG AND SMALL TO BYPASS THE SYSTEM. IN FAVOR OF DIRECTLY CALLING THEIR- NEIGHBORS FOR ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED ROSS ESSENTIALLY FOR FREE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FINANCIAL COMMENDED COMMITMENT TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE. WE NEED TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS US TO EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY DEPLOY OUR FIREFIGHTERS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CAL O. S. PRE pEXPANDED TO INCLUDE DISPATCHERS AS WELL AS COMMAND AND CONTROL OVERHEAD STAFF. LAST YEAR PRE POSITIONING FUNDING WAS APPROVED TO STAFF EXTRA DISPATCHERS IN HIGH FIRE SEVERITY CONDITIONS AT BOTH THE REGION AND OPERATIONAL DISPATCH CENTERS. THE IMPACT OF THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES ON OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE PACKED IN CONTROLLING MULTIPLE FIRE IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. RESOURCE WERE DRAWN DOWN DUE TO THE KINCAID FIRE AND MUCH OF THE STATE WAS IMPACTED BY THE PGA ANY. PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE ALREADY SORT ENGINES AND FIREFIGHTERS THE FUNDING FOR PRE POSITIONING BROUGHT RESOURCES INTO THE EAST BAY WHICH ALLOWED ME TO PROVIDE CONTRA COSTA. WITH THE HAMMER THEY NEEDED TO CONTROL TEN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT FIRES WHILE MY AGENCY MAINTAINED ITS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO OVER. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY INCIDENTS IN OUR OWN AREA OVER THE SAME EIGHTEEN HOUR PERIOD. IN CLOSING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THROUGH CALIFORNIA PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES AS OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR AND REGION COORDINATORS WHICH ALL ALLOW US TO WORK TOGETHER AS A UNIFIED FORCE DURING LARGE SCALE EVENTS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE MORE INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY WE USED TO ENSURE THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY SO WE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY- MY NAME'S STEVE KOVACS ON THE FIRE CHIEF OF THE SCOTTS VALLEY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND ON THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND- BOX. THREE HUNDRED. SIX SIX OF THIS. I'M ALSO CURRENTLY ONE OF THE OPERATIONAL RECORDED OR OF ACCOUNT IMPROVE SERVED THAT SAME AND CALIBERS FOR THE SEVEN YEAR PRIOR ALSO HAVING SERVED ON THE FIRST BORDER DIRECTORS. TWENTY FIRE SYSTEMS AGREEMENT GOSHEN COMMITTEE AND AS OF ALL REP. AND ON THE STATE BOARD OF FIRE SERVICES- I'LL BE SHARING WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TODAY- MOSTLY FROM THE SMALL AGENCY. SIDE OF THINGS AND THE IMPACTS OF MUTUAL AID SYSTEM HAS ON THOSE. LOOK GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SAT THROUGH MUTUAL AID SYSTEM- CREATE A LINE SURE RESOURCES. ON ANY MAJOR WHILE AND FIRE WITHIN THE STATE- WE MAKE UP THE LARGEST DEPTH OF AVAILABLE ASSETS- FOR THESE INCIDENTS. SMALLER AGENCIES CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT. OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE SYSTEM. ALL THERE ARE INHERENT CHAO. THAT COME DO THAT LACK ASIDE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH OF APPLE AND PER TO GIVE TO THE SO. PHONE AGENCIES OFTEN HAVE A LACK OF STAFFING TO COVER THEIR OWN JURISDICTIONS ADEQUATELY AND ARE. RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP RESOURCES FOR FEAR THE RAMIFICATIONS ON THE HOME FRONT IF AN AGENCY ONLY STAFF TO FIRE ENGINES ON A DAILY BASIS AND THEY GIVE UP ONE OF THOSE THAT REDUCES THEIR RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE BY 50% GOVERNING BODIES ARE ALWAYS COMFORTABLE FACED WITH THESE- PARTICULAR SITUATIONS SO. MAJOR FIRES FIRES AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY- SELDOM HAPPEN AT ONE TIME. AND WE NEED ALL THE AGENCIES IN THE FIGHT SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO MUTUAL AID SYSTEM HAS BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 30% MANY OF THAT NUMBER. ARE FROM SMALLER AGENCIES THAT HAVE A HAVE A HARDER TIME RECOVERING FROM THE RECESSION. SMALL AGENCIES HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT THE ARDEST BY NUMEROUS FUNDING ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- STARTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ALTHOUGH THIS WAS VERY GOOD FOR THE TAX PAYER I IT WAS DEVASTATING FOR FIRED. THAT RELY UPON THIS IS THE MADE SOURCE OF REVENUE. NINETY TWO NOW THE PERMANENT AFTER YEAR SHIFTED SCHOOLS. THIS IS CALLED ERA SB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN FEES AND NOT GETTING A FAIR SHARE OF PROP ONE SEVENTY TWO FUNDING IN MANY COUNTIES. IN ADDITION THERE ARESOME AGENCIES ARE REFUSED TO CONTRIBUTE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES DUE TO THE CHALLENGER REIMBURSEMENT. AND RECOVERING THE TOTAL COST OF THE RESPONSE. MOSTLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BEACH LATE SYSTEM IS EXECUTED BY PERSONNEL EXPECTED TO PERFORM THIS WORK ON AS A COLLATERAL DUTY. IN ABSORB THE SURGE CAPACITY WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN FINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY BUT IS NOT IN OUR CURRENT ERA. THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER STAFFING UTILIZES FULL CAPABILITY AND A CITY DURING THOSE TIMES OF SEARCH THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE PUSHED TO THE REGION COORDINATORS DOWN OF THE OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATORS BUT DO NOT PROVIDE PROPEL. THE PORT THE EXTRA WORK. RIGHT FOR ON STRATEGY TO SECURELY TERM FINANCE FIND SUPPORT FIRST UNDER FUNDED FOR AGE. ENSURE FUNDING FOR STAFFING IS AVAILABLE TO FULL UNIFIED UTILIZE THE CAPACITY OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. THEN ACT LEGISLATION TO FIX THE ISSUES FACED WITH BY AGENCIES THAT MUST TAKE FIREFIGHTERS IN AN OUT OF VOLUNTEER STATUS WITHOUT PENALTIES OF LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS. OUR PRECIPITATION THIS YEAR HAS BEEN. BELOW NORMAL IN MOST PARTS OF THE STATE IN THE NEXT FIRE SEASON WILL BE SOON UPON. URBAN ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED AND CANNOT WAIT FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS- CALIFORNIAN JOYS THE MOST ROBUST MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE WORLD ARE FIRE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED. MY MUTILATE SYSTEM WAS ALSO CHANGE WITH. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS TO THE- AND ALL TO. THANK YOU CHIEF EN HAVE ALL SHE ADDRESS.

WE SIMPLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. AND EXPECTS SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. TWO YEARS AGO. AT THIS COMMITTEE HERE ALL THE STATE'S FIRE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING CAL SHE'S FAR DISTRICTS. LEGAL CALIFORNIA PART SECTION. CALIFORNIA METRO CHIEFS CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE FOR PRESENTATIONS WE FORMED A COALITION CALLED THE RISK. WHICH IS THE PASTOR READINESS FOR COMMUNITY. T.

WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE AN THAT AGAIN FOR YOUR GREAT SUPPORT OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOU. STATE TO HELP BUT FAR AS AN EQUIPMENT IN PLACE A BAD. WE CALL POSITIONING. WE DON'T KNOW IT IS ASKING US. YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE THE WEATHER CONDITION. THE TOPOGRAPHY. AND WE CAN IT'S A HARD AND FAST. WE CAN MAKE A GREAT DIFFERENCE SO FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR ALONE WE SPENT CLOSE TO EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS WE STILL HAVE ALMOST THE- WE- WINNER THROUGH. GIVE ME THE FOR MANY MONTHS THE SUN WHICH CA BE. ON LEE WE'VE NOT MADE A WHOLE OF PROPER IN THE AREA OF TECHNO. HOW FAR HAS MOVED FORWARD ON THE- VIEW LOCATOR OR AB ELSE'S. AND MERGE UNITS. THE STATE OKAY. HAS ALEC FONG. TO PLACES. IN BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCE. IN OUR STATE ALL MORE SERVICES A QUICK. THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE. CAN FOR A MOMENT AND THIS IS BUT IT'S TRUE THAT CAN USE TECHNOLOGY EVERYDAY TO TRACKER LEFT. YOU CAN WATCH THEM GO DOWN THE STREET YOU CAN CALL DOMINO'S AND TRACK YOUR PIZZA HATE AND DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME. THAT TECHNOLOGY EXISTS BUT WE CAN'T POINT TODAY WERE LOCAL GROUP GOVERNMENT RESOURCES ARE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY UNITS AND STAFFING MAKE UP APPROX ME LARGE FIRES.

WE FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR FIFTY BROAD NEVER CALL FIRST AT TWO WHICH FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WITHOUT COMPETING WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON CHURCH SYSTEMS DURING HIS PASTOR.

WE LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH FOR RECOMMENDATIONS WE COULD TELL COOPER SISKEL FIRST WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR PRE POSITIONING FUND. OF RESOURCES ANNUALLY SOMETIMES AMAME MANY MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT FUNDING I THINK YOU'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS STORIES TODAY OF SO LAW.

THE OTHER GOVERNMENT SO IF WE'RE GONNA BE PART OF A SISTER WHICH WE WILL BE TO FIRST WE NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE AT THAT THAT INFORMATION TO SEE WHAT THAT IS AND THAT'S WHEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HAS BEEN REQUESTED. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR IMPORTANT AND I HAVE A QUESTIONS BUT I DO WANT TO OPEN WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS AND STARTING WITH- A LARGE AMOUNT OF GRATITUDE BECAUSE TO CHIEF LORENZEN'S POINT ABOUT RESHAPING PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS ONE OF THE FOR AS I DID ON AT THE START OF LAST FIRE SEASON WAS ACTUALLY HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY WORKSHOPS. IN PREPARE FOR HIGHER ANY TO THE AGENCY I READ RIGHT HERE AT THE TABLE TODAY GLADLY STEPPED UP AND WE FILLED MULTIPURPOSE ROOMS IN EACH OF THE THREE VALLEY'S IRAQ AND A GROUP SAN FERNANDO. LISTEN ALLEY. AND FOLK WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT WHILE SEASONS MULTIPLE TIMES WE STILL ASTONISHED AT THE LEVEL TWO WHICH THEY KNEW TO ENGAGE AS RESIDENTS AND HOMEOWNERS IN THIS PROCESS AND THERE WAS NOTHING MORE CLEAR THAN THEN THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WALLS FIRE WE KNEW THAT IT WAS REAL. FUNDAMENTALLY A BEING LIFE AT THE POINT WHEN WE COULD ON HOW THAT FIRE WAS MOVING WE SAW IT AGAIN. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE HAD THE TECH FIRE WE HAVE THE SADDLE RIDGE FIRE WE THE EASY FIRE. WANTED PEOPLE TO MOVE WE WANTED THEM TO BE PREPARED AND TO BE READY TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES WE WERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT THIS TIME. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE STILL GLITCHES AND TO THAT. I APPRECIATE ALL OF STEPPING IN TO DO THESE AFTER REPORTS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO BETTER NEXT TIME. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT SAVES PROPERTY. LITTLE THINKING LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE TO. ABOUT STAFFING. AND ABOUT OVER TIME. FOR FIREFIGHTERS. AND I GET THAT THERE'S PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW ONE OR TWO WEEKS A YEAR OF DOWNTIME NOW WHERE WE COULD BE CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT THAT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT WHEN I HAVE FIREFIGHTERS IN FRONT OF ME SAYING THAT THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. DIDN'T HAVE TIME OFF THEY WORKED FORTY EIGHT HOURS STRAIGHT AND THEY STAYED ON THAT FIRE. FOR THE REMAINING WEEKS BUT IT TOOK TO FINALLY KNOCK IT DOWN. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE POINTS DOES TO OPERATING FIRE SERVICES AT PER SESSION. FIRE FIVE LEVELS WE FIRES HAVE FUN. CHANGED IT IS A NEW NORM WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF CYCLES NOW OF SAYING THESE FIRES ARE A NEW NORMAL WE CAN'T FIGHT A NEW NORMAL. WITH AN OUTDATED STAFFING PLAN. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW MY VICE CHAIR AND I SHARE THIS AS A HIGH PRIORITY WE NEED TO CONTINUE. ELEVATE THAT TO ENSURE THAT EACH OF YOUR DEPARTMENTS IS ADEQUATELY STAFFED UNIQUE PRESS. CONCERNS ABOUT MOVING VOLUNTEER FIGHTERS IN AND OUT OF THAT STAT. TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP UNITY SAFE MOST BEING COMPLIANT WITH THE LOSS I APPRECIATE BRINGING NOT FORWARD INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT BEING SAID. I APPRECIATE YOUR FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WERE VERY VERY CLEAR- I WOULD WELCOME EACH OF YOU. ADDITIONALLY TO SUBMIT TO US IN WRITING. DREAM PLAN LET ANNA. WHAT IS IT LIKE. HOW MUCH MORE.

THE BACK. OUT WAS A ENOUGH TO GET OUT AT THE TIME THE ENGINE WITH THE BACK. SIX THE FIVE MOVING AT THE TIME AND THEY WERE THE TO REMAIN FIRE FOR AT STATION WE HAVE LOVED TO HAVE THAT OUT IN THE FIELD BUT THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR- SO I GOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO YOU AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT THIS TO US IN WRITING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MY VICE CHAIR AND I ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THROUGH THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND CERTAINLY NOW IS WORK IN THESE. CONVERSE WHICH WILL CONCLUDE IN JUNE. BUT WE GET YOU. IS IT BETTER TO TRY TO.

YOU AND MANY OF THEM GO THROUGH PTSD. ARE YOU DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE TOUGH GUYS BUT IN A WHICH IS HUMAN BEINGS THIS IS TOUGH STUFF WHEN YOU'RE WAY FROM YOUR FAMILY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO PULL OF. A BURNED BODY OUT OF A- A HOME OR A CAR I MEAN THIS JUST DOES HAVE AN IMPACT AND SO- I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN SIDE. OF THE GREAT WORK YOU DO AS WELL AND SO I CAN CORRECT IT IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO. QUESTION SO. I IT THE GOVERNOR IN THIS IN HIS BUT IN THIS BUDGET DOES MAKE SOME SPUR A COMMON I THINK WE PUT IN ABOUT BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR FOR MORE HELICOPTERS- AIR SUPPORT EQUIPMENT AND I THINK THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO PUT IN A REQUEST FOR SEVEN HUNDRED MORE FIREFIGHTERS AND I'M WONDERING.

THE TO. WELL FIRST OF ALL. HOME I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS COULD AS A PERTAINS TO PUBLIC SAFE I WAS I WON'T. DON'T WANT TO SAY IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. YES MY UNDERSTAND THIS STEP IS GOING TO BE A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS. THIS IS GONNA BE BRING IN A- OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY IN PRIOR TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND THE DOCTORS ARE A PLUS THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING SIKORSKY HELICOPTERS IN THOSE THE SAME CAR PRESENT LA COUNTY GOT INITIALLY BUT THE MENTOR CUNNINGHAM. THE LEASING. SO THAT. I THE ONLY A LIKE WHAT SAY A DISH TO THAT IS I MISSION OR IS WE NOT GONNA BE A HIGH PEOPLE FAST ENOUGH BUT THROUGH WE ASK FROM INTO X. I DO A OR A LOT TO IS THE THEY CAN ORDER. THAT COULD STAFF LIKE SO OF THE ENTITIES OF WANT TO. MORE THAN ME TOO LATE OF I CAME AN EXAM NOT UP IN YOU OF. MENTION IT PLACE IT. DECEMBER PORTS IN THE MEETING OF STAFFING BUT I'M AYE TO PAR KNOWN ISSUE WE HAVE FAR FOR SO WHY TO WORK OUT OF EQUIPMENT. AND I KNOW FROM MY ORGANS NINE THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IN THIS SO IS THAT. STEP IN AND SO INTO THE A IT'S NOT JUST FOR US IT'S WE CAN. THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA BUT AT THE STATE SAVE TO. DEPLOY MORE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A ORDERS A LIKE THAN. OF THESE OF LAKE. OF ORANGE COUNTY SANTA GUARDS MUCH SOMETHING COME. FOR A- WE'LL PUT MORE RESOURCES TO THIS. HOW WAY AND EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT MANAGED CHAIN HEREBY I DO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR IN MY WORK TRY TO HOW MAKE SURE THE BUDGET ALLOCATED ON TO WHERE WE NEED AND WORK FOR. I LIKE EVERYBODY BUT THERE'S CAMPARI SET UP ASK YOU TO PAY TO THE GUY WANTS CAL FOR. ADDING FOR TO COME OF MOST THEY NEITHER BUT RESTORED PER SE LEVEL THEY NEED HIRE A VIGIL BROKEN. OF BATES FIRE SERVICES WHICH OF HER HERE TO ABOUT THE PROVIDER AGENCY THAT SAYS. IN UPWARDS OF EIGHTY OF THE RESOURCES AT PEAK FARSI FOR THE FIRE. THERE. THAT IS. CATERED FOR THE NEW SUPPORT H. AS WELL. SO PART OF MY- DEBT. TO EVERYBODY FROM SMALLER. WITH ONE IN TWO ENGINE. TWO EIGHT. WITH A HIGH AND EIGHTY SEVEN A ONLY HAS LIKE THAT HUNDRED SEVEN SO. LARGE AND SMALL MUNICIPAL. THE A PIECE OF PIE. TO BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR REESE. AND SERVICE. AND REIMBURSED FOR IT. THEY HAVE AN OFF. TO HIRE FIRE. AT TO. STAFFING LEVELS AS WELL BUT- THAT MONEY HAS TO BE THERE OR THEY WON'T SEND THE RESOURCES AND IF THEY CAN GET REIMBURSED. AND FINALLY IN. US NOT ONLY WILL ORDERING SO. CAN OUT A FISH YEAH. BUT YEAH HAS AND- THANK YOU. BUT THE RESPONDING AGENCY LIKE. DOWNEY ALWAYS THE OTHER. POLLS UP AND DOWN THIS. AND PUT OUR- FIVE ON THOSE. ENGINES MORE OF THOSE. ENGINES IN THE- ALL DIFFERENT. TYPES SINCE. THEN WE CAN MORE. THERE'S WIRES. AS FAR AS IT SO. WHAT'S THE NEED. TO I THINK THE COMMON THEME IS THAT YOU NEED AS MUCH HELP AS POSSIBLE THE EARLIEST POSSIBE TIMES WHEN YOU FIGHT THESE FIRES. ABOUT TO IMPLEMENT THE I THINK IT'S CALLED THE STOCK SYSTEM TO REPLACE THE CURRENT ROB SINCE I'M INTERESTED. BECAUSE ACTIVATED IN MARCH I'M WONDERING IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF ADVANCE. A LOOK AT THE ADS SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE US AN INDICATION WHETHER YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO- RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OR DO WE NEED TO SORT OF COME BACK IN A- YEARS WHEN IT'S- PLUMMETED. FIND OUT WHETHER TO. THE PROMISE IN THE EXPECT THAT WE HAVE A- IS IT ALREADY. OBSOLETE NOW HELP WELL I THINK IT GOES BACK TO HER PRESIDENT WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT FIRST MET. I MEAN THAT'S UP OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THIS GO SHE BY THE STATE. THAT AS FIRST RESPONDERS WE DON'T HAVE INPUT IN TO WITH A LOOKS LIKE THE WEATHER NEGOTIATIONS ARE FORTUNATELY IN LA COUNTY WE DO BECAUSE WE HAD A GRANT FAR PRIOR PRESIDENT SO WE WERE ABLE TO DEAL WITH EIGHTEEN T. THAT'S NOT EASY ORGANIZATION. WITHIN ME TO SYSTEM. BUT I ROCKETS ISN'T EXAMPLE I'M I'M A REASON TO LIKE A ROACHES REGION TO AND THAT WAS CHERYL ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IT WILL BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS AND THEN IT WILL BE NICE. IS THERE AN A CONVEYOR ALSO. RECEIVE ARM. REGIONAL OR- RISK RESOURCES FROM ONE COUNTY LA QUE VINCE SAID OF SANTA OBISPO THAT WE WOULD HAVE SOME ANOTHER SOME IN. AND PUT. I RECOMMEND SO I WE COMMISSIONER. YOUR REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE WHETHER IT'S ROSSER IROC THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES IN ORDER FOR THAT SYSTEM TO WORK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS OUT THERE THAT WE'VE BROUGHT UP TODAY- THAT. HAVE PLACE FOR THAT SYSTEM TO BE FULLY UTILIZED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT- THE POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY. BUSBY I'D ABOUT HAVING THE STAFFING BUT NOT HAVING THE FIRE ENGINES I ROCKS ON FIX THAT. THE APPLE I. UP. WHERE WE DON'T STAFF YOU KNOW OUR OUR PROP ON THIS AGENCY IS JUST OPPOSITE WE HAVE PLENTY OF FIRE ENGINES. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO PUT ON. SO THOSE ALSO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF TO BE FULLY SUCCESSFUL SO. CAN I ADD TO THAT FOR YOU- IRAQ I'M GLAD THEY'RE USING THAT NAME BACK IN THE DAY THAT FOR THOSE WAS THE BILL CARS THE CAMARO IROC Z. WAS ONE OF THE CARS EVER INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH BINS. NEW ORDER THEM NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THOSE CAR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING CO DEFIED. DIE TO BIG FAT. THE RESPONSE TO MAKE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LOCAL ENTITIES AS YOU'VE HEARD IS ALREADY HAPPENING. A PART OF THE SYSTEM TO BIFURCATE CAL FIRE NO YES OF IT PIECES OF THE ORDERING SYSTEM CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A TIME WHEN IN YEARS THAT. EIGHT OUT AFTER ORDER WAS. FILLED YOU IF I FIRE LIKE. SO EVERY THAT SO MORE FOR IF WE CAN LEGISLATIVELY TO FOR THE- IN WAY. WHERE CA. AMONGST AGENTS THIS CALL. AND ACTUALLY PART OF THE AXIS WOULD. RIGHT THANK YOU JOHN SO MUCH FOR YOUR TEST APPRECIATE YOU MAKING A TRIP TODAY. AND NOW WILL. FORCED AND FEDERAL PURSE I'D LIKE TO WELCOME JOE TILE DEPUTY. OF PART AND PRO. FOR THE DEPARTMENT FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND BRIAN MARSHALL CAL- YES FIRE AND RESCUE CHIEF. ARGUMENT WHICH MICROPHONE WORK. I THINK THAT. GERMAN FOR JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON- I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHARE THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANCE OF. BEING MUTILATED. YOU KNOW I THINK IT IMPORTANT TO FIRST TALK ABOUT TO WEAR FIRE IS ASKING THE MUTUALLY THE MEN OFFER RESOURCE TO THE MUTUALLY JUST. AT CAL IS. HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS THAT WERE- ADDED TO OUR BULLDOZERS TO PROVIDE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN A BULLDOZER COVERAGE ACROSS THE STATE WITH CAL FIRE- TO THE- FIFTY NINE BULLDOZERS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE. IN ADDITION A U. S. THERE A RECORDING ASATRU AWARENESS AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ADD AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN INTEL SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS TO HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT OF SAYING WHERE WE'VE BEEN IN THIS DEVASTATION AND ALL OF MY PARTNERS APPEARS THAT WERE HERE BEFORE US ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE MENTIONING. CALPERS PROPOSING NOW TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN AND- MOVE FORWARD RELATED TO RESOURCES- INTO THE FUTURE SO IN THE CURRENT PROPOSED. BUDGET MOVING FORWARD CAL FIRE THIS LOOKED AT THE STAFFING. AND WHILE WE'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FIRE ENGINES AT THIS TIME THE STAFFING IS IMPORTANT IN ALL EXPLAIN WHY YOU EARLY HEALTH AND WELLNESS FIGHTERS ON THE LINE FOR MULTIPLE HOURS WE HAVE OUR SELVES. THE LOCAL STATE OR FAT PARTNERS ARE FIREFIGHTERS ARE FINE WELL THEN THEY SHOULD AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND PROVIDE THEM RELIEF. SO CAL FIRE IS GOING TO BE POSING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POSITIONS PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS AS A FIRE FIGHTING PERSONNEL THOSE ARE. PERSON DISTRICT A LITTLE SUPPORT THE YOU. DELAYED SYSTEM BUT THAT'S JUST AS SAID EARLIER- WE ONE ONE BUCKET THAT THE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE OF THOSE ARE FIGHTING PERSONNEL OF IT WILL. BE IN A FEW FANS ARE PREVENT UP IS OUR FIRING ARE HELP BACK BASES ARE ATTACK BASES AT TO BE ABLE TO THE NET THIRTY SUPPORT RELIEF TO OUR PER OF THAT. CURRENTLY. HOW THE GROUP TO. THE FIRE CHIEF TO SET ARE. THEY WERE HERE EARLIER IN ACHIEVE MARSHALL PREVIOUSLY HIS PRE ROLE ARE TOWN. OF K. FIRE HAVE SIX CAN OF THE CRISIS KERN COUNTY COUNTY BEEN TRUE COUNTY LA QUE. SAN OF COUNTY AND MARIN. NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT. UPPER SIDE TALKED ABOUT THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN AND WE EVEN TALK ABOUT THE THIRTEEN ENGINES FROM LAST YEAR. THOSE COUNTRY TO RECEIVE A PROPORTION CHAIR OF THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE THE HOPEFULLY THIS FIRE CHEESE CAN SCAN SITTER- WHAT THEY WILL DO THOSE FUNDS WHEN AMPLE. THEIR BUDGETS- IT TAKES US. GOING BACK TO WHAT CAL FIRE HAS- PREVIOUSLY IN A CONTINUING TO DO I AM PROUD TO SAY THE CAL FIRE HAS THE LARGEST- FIGHTING AVIATION PLEA IN THE WORLD- WE ARE CURRENTLY STILL WITH UNITED COAST GUARD UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ON THE DELIVERY OF SEVEN SIX ONE THIRTY HER. CRAFT BEER. TANKERS I WAS PART NATIONAL DEFENSE OTHER ACT. OF THAT PROVIDES THE FUNDING FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT AS WELL THE PAINT AND THEN YOU ARE ALL OF YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTED- THE OP CAN AMENDMENTS OF THOSE GOING FORWARD- WE- CRAFT THEY WILL. A TOTAL SEVEN. OF THOUSAND GALLON CAPE AIR TANKERS IT'LL BE FOR ACROSS THE STATE FIVE OF THOSE ANY ONE TIME TWO OF THOSE LEFT IN RESERVE STATUS AND MAINTENANCE STATUS ACROSS IS LOCATED IN A RAMONA PASSER LOS MY- SHE- AND THEN WE WILL. RE OPEN THE FOR AIR BASE WITH BOTH C. ONE THIRD TANK AND AIR TO PLATFORM THERE. NOW IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING PROCESS. WORKING STATED WITH AGENCIES AND- THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE IS- OWNERSHIP OF THE CONTRACT TO IN A TO IMPLEMENT THE REGARD DELIVERY SYSTEM AND- OTHER C. ONE THIRTY AIRCRAFT AND THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY AWARDED. BOARD TO COLSON A- BY DUE TO OUR- THEY HAD TO SUSPEND- THAT- THAT CONTRACT UNTIL THEY COULD REVIEW IT BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME TO SOME RESOLUTION HERE REAL SOON. WELL TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. THE FOR. THE ONE THIRTY AIR TANKER FLYING STATE A CAP WITH ITS PRIMARY LOOK CAN AMONG BY THE TO THE. TWENTY AS WE ABOUT. CLEAR IT WELL WE TALKED ABOUT THE HELLO PRO AND WE THE SUPPORT GIVEN OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION ON THE REPLACEMENT OF THE U. H. ONE H. HELICOPTERS TO THE S. SEVENTY. HERE IS THE AND BLACKROCK MODEL HELICOPTER THAT MY PARTNER'S BEHIND US ARE USING- CURRENTLY AND ARE ALSO RECEIVING THOSE AIRCRAFT THERE ARE GREAT UTILITY HELICOPTER. WE WILL IN BE A OF NIGHTS WITH LEASE FIVE OF THOSE CELICA THOUGH ALL TWELVE OF THEM WILL BE CAPABLE OF FLYING AT NIGHT- AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE. WE HAVE A SEVENTY AYE EATEN IN FOR NOW FOR- IN INGLEWOOD COLORADO GETTING IT'S AVIONICS ON- ONE IS INTER TEXAS ENDED IN THE OTHERS POLAND ACROSS THE- WE WENT. EXPECT SELL IT. PRIVATE EUROPEAN IT WILL GO TO A JUST NORTH OF CHEAP SO THEN WILL EXPECTED THE REST THEM EVERY HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS- OR OR SOMEWHERE NEAR THERE AFTER. I WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE THIRTY- AIR TANKERS AND JUST BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST MENTION THIS MOMENT. IN THE LAST BUDGET YOUR- SUPPORT OF THE AVIATION FLEET. YOU ALSO SUPPORTED A THREE YEAR CONTRACT FOR A TRAINING PLATFORM. OF LARGE AIR TANKER TRAINING PLATFORM LOCATED WELL IN THAT IT WAS GIVEN TO. CLOSE IT. GEN AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A MOMENT I'M- TO. TWO EIGHT NINE THE BEN OF THE TREE THAT ARE. EVEN THOUGH CO THIRD OR TANKERS. BUT WHAT I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IS AGAIN PUBLIC GIVE MY THOUGHTS WITH THE CALLS AND AVIATION AND- THE FLIGHT CREW OF AIR TANKER ONE THIRTY FOR THE CRIME IN AUSTRALIA ASSISTING IN IN FOR. YEARS TAKE A ONE THREE FOUR WAS A FLOP CALIFORNIA WORKING CLOSELY WITH COLSON AVIATION TO TRY TO FIND A REPLACEMENT- TRACTOR PLATFORM TO TEN YOU ARE TRAINING EFFORTS. NOW ALL OF CRASH. TELL YOUR BULLDOZER ARE P. HARM PEOPLE AS WELL OF ALL OUR C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OPERATOR&lt;/c&gt;</u> BUT THE LOW INFO LEVEL A REALLY MAKE UP THE FIRE SERVE AND CAL WE HAVE A GOLD THREE TO MITIGATE OFF. AND FIVE PERSONAL FIRES THE LAST THANK YES EARLIER THERE ARE HOW OF THE OF FIRE ACROSS CAL BUT EVERY A LOT BECAUSE EVERYBODY THE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE FOR RIGHT OUR- JOB MAY. SPEYER WHENEVER HERE ABOUT. WE HAVE A MAJOR ACCIDENT DO TO OUR REACH AND RELY ON THE ME AID SAYS TO SET CAL FIRE IN ITS S. SIRI MISSION STATE WAS HERE MISSION. I AM IT'S MY EXPECTED SO WE'RE SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COOPERATED REQUIRE IN THEIR FAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MIDSHIPS WELL. CAL FIRE STOOD UP TO RAPIDLY TO AN- TWO TO INCREASE DECREASE ITS- ARE PRETTY RAPIDLY RAPPER WE PARTICIPATE IN NUMBER OF A PRIEST AGREE AND- AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT HERE SOON BY CHIEF MARSHALL. TO HELP FACILITATE THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT ARE LOW IN FAT UP HIS PRESENT AN- TO US FIGHTING FIRES. I HEARD ABOUT OCT ABOUT MY PRIVATE INSIGHT AND- HOW. ORDERS OR PLACED IN I THINK YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT. IN AND SO. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS I MENTION IT. WE CURRENTLY UTILIZE THE RESOURCE ORDERING STATUS SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS ROSS. THE RAS SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF AT MIDNIGHT ON MARCH FIFTH. THE INTER AGENCY RESOURCE- ORDERING CAPABILITY IROC I WILL BE OUT TURNED ON IN CALIFORNIA SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MARCH ELEVENTH AND MARCH THIRTEENTH IT IS A FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT LEAVES US ABOUT SEVEN DAYS OF A BLACKOUT ORDERING SYSTEM AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAVE MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT WE HAVE NO MAJOR WHAT THE CROSS STATE K. BUT- RK. EARS ARE PRIMARY THE SAFETY AND POINTS ARE THIS CENTER SHOULD HAVE CONTINUITY OF OP PLAN AND THOSE RUSH USER SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO A UTILIZING THEIR TO CUT PLANS TO OVERCOME THIS ISSUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN HOPE OR NO MAJOR ISSUES NOW. TALK ABOUT IRAQ GETTING TURNED BACK ON THERE ARE CONCERNS AND WE HAVE EXPRESSED THOSE CONCERNS THOSE CONCERNS ARE THAT- WHEN IT GETS TURNED BACK ON WE WILL NOT WE BUT GLOBALLY THE IROC SYSTEM WILL NOT TRAINED ANYBODY ON HOW TO USE AT THE MOMENT THAT IT'S AND ON THERE ARE FOR BOTTLES OF TRAINING THERE ARE- MODULE THAT HAVE HELPED BY THE- TEAM IN THERE IS THE FOURTH Mà. CAN. AND WE WILL THAT OUT THERE OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED ROSH AND- RIGHT NOW. AND WE EXPECT IRA YOU TO BE. VERY SIMILAR IN NATURE EDIT SAVE IRA. IS GONNA IS GOING TO WORK ANY THAN ROSS I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER TODAY PARTIALLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT EITHER I HAVEN'T SEEN THE TRAINING MODULES BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT. AS WELL WE TALK ABOUT IT AND IT WAS EARLIER. SO ROD. IS A- WHAT. WHEN IT WAS BILL OVER A DECADE A- HAD NO CAL. VOICE ON IT. I AT LEAST FROM QUE FIRES FOR. WE MADE SURE THAT WE HAD A CALIFORNIA VOICE ON THE IRA GROUP- TO- AS AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RELAY INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH. BUT WHETHER IT'S ROSSER IRONIC. IT'S A PIECE OF SOFTWARE. IN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO INPUT THE ORDER INTO A PIECE OF SOFTWARE AND HAVE SOMEBODY AT THE OTHER END WHO CAN EXTRACT THE ORDER OF THE PIECE OF SOFTWARE SO THE QUESTION IS RIDLEY WHETHER ROSS OR IRAQ IS BROKEN I WOULD SAY. NO THE PROCESS IS IN A- THE PROCESS IS CHALLENGED IN NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED AND WE CAN APPROVE THAT THROUGH. THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF STAFFING- STAFFING OF AS YOU HEARD EARLIER STAFFING OF OUR DISPATCH CENTERS WHO ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING ORDERS FROM THE FIELD WHAT THE SAME TIME TAKING NINE ONE ONE CALLS. FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE TRAPPED OR WERE SEEKING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES. NOW THEY ARE PLACING THERE'S ORDERS ORDERS ARE GOING TO OPERATIONAL CENTERS ON IN REDDING ONE AND RIVERSIDE WHERE THEY ARE CO LOCATED BETWEEN- CAL FIRE HELLO YES AND FEDERAL RESOURCES- AND OR- STAFF. SOMETIME THERE'S A PLACE OUT AND OP AREAS THAT ALSO HAVE. GOING ON SO YOU WERE INJURED BY. BY NOW WERE ABLE TO PUT AN EXTRA. INFORMATION OUT OF WHAT ONE BE A- SO I WOULDN'T THIS IS OUR- EVERYBODY. I'M SURE HAS AS PART OF COMPANY OF OP. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER AND HAVE A PLAN AND EXERCISE THAT PLAN TO ENSURE THAT YOUR WHEN YOU HAVE A MAJOR INSTEAD OF ANY ALL HAZARD OR IS TIED. THAT YOU TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO GET YOUR- LOW. AND OFF COMMAND. IN AN EXPANDED CENTER WHERE YOU'RE- NINE ONE. FOR ALL YOUR OTHER INCIDENTS PROTECTING EVERY YEAR CAN. ARE STILL THERE TO BE RUN. IF THAT MAKES SENSE. WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH CALLOW YES IN OUR LOCAL PARTNERS FOR MANY YEARS TO USE THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM BUT IT IS A STRANGE SYSTEM THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES ON A RECORDED HISTORY IF THE CLASS ENGINE OF SPREAD ACTIVE OVERGROWN PROLONGED DROUGHT THAT WOULD STILL BE COVERING FROM- AS WELL AS THE- RECENT. NUMBER WHILE THERE'S ALSO. THIS. WORK TOGETHER THROUGH FIRE SCOPE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THAT- ONE OTHER ITEM- MADAM VICE CHAIR YOU ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND WHERE WE WERE ON THAT I'LL JUST ADDRESS THAT AND SHE- FROM TWO WORKING CLOSELY I'M GOING TO DEATH BUT WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD WE REALIZE THEIR ASSETS OF THE- ON STAFF AND YOU NINE IT'S AN AERIAL PLATFORM REMOTE SERVERS A STAFF SEE TWELVE SIX SINCE TYPE AIRCRAFT THAT IS ABLE TO PUT. UP A REAL TIME DATA ONCE WE CAN GET THAT AIRCRAFT UP OVER AN INCIDENT AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD IS PARTICIPATING WHAT THEY CALL FIRE GUARD WHICH UTILIZING A REMOTE SENSORS FROM CLASSIFIED INFORMATION DE CLASSIFYING THAT MAKING IT A BIT. TO TIRES IS DEFINITELY. SEVEN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THIS LAST YEAR YOU ALSO OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GO INTO A INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENT SPRINT TO PROCESS- AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH TECHNIQUES OF FIRE PROTECTION- THAT RESOURCE IT'S WORKED WELL FOR THE PROOF OF CONCEPT WERE NOW CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS MOVING LONG TERM. SAID EARLIER AND TELLS THE- STOP BEING THERE. I THE CURRENT YEAR A HUNDRED ADDITIONAL- FIRE VALIDATION CAMERAS ON THE RECALL THE FIRE DETECTION CAMERA AT THIS POINT- WERE- OFFERED- BEEP PLACED ON VARIOUS MOUNTAIN TOPS IN THE COURSE WE UTILIZE OUR PRO LONG ARE BEING THE CW AND IS WITH- AND TELL. CAPABILITIES TO ASSIST US IN THOSE NEEDS AS WELL SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK FORWARD ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT TIME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SMITH BODIES CHAIRED JACKSON SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON IN- SOME OF THE UNIQUENESS SERVE OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THE COLLABORATION- INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE. MARSHALL I'M A THIRTY THREE YEAR VETERAN PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTER I SPENT THE LAST THIRTY TWO YEARS IN KERN COUNTY- SEVEN YEARS AS THE FIRE CHIEF WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND ALL OF MY PARTNERS BEHIND ME ANY YEAR AGO I WAS OFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN THE STATE'S FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL IT SYSTEM. AND IT'S THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE IN IS A FIREFIGHTER I USED IT AS A FIRE CHIEF MIKE FOR HELP. AND I KNOW WHAT THE SYSTEM IS. THERE'S NO OTHER LEGISLATIVE BODY TALKING ABOUT A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM LIKE WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ROBUST. WORKS AND LET ME STRESS SOMETHING IT'S ALL HAZARD I KNOW THE FOCUS TODAY IS ON WILDFIRE BUT WE USE THE SAME SYSTEM LAST SUMMER WHEN THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE IN ITS CREST. THE MUTUAL SYSTEM IS THE NINE HELP OUR NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA IS A BIG STATE AND WE MOVE RESOURCES ALL OVER THE- SO TO ME TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE- AIDS OF OUR- NHà FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. MANY OF THE DISASTERS AND EVENTS- WE LEARN FROM. AND IF YOU IF YOU DON'T LEARN FROM YOUR BOUNDARY PETE HISTORY. AND WE DO AFTER ACTIONS AFTER THESE LARGE EVENTS BUT WE SEE. THREE FOCUS AREAS THAT CAL O. S. ON OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM COLLABORATION PREPARATION AND TECHNOLOGY. COLLABORATION YOU'VE SAW A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUALS FIRE CHIEFS FIRE CAPTAIN FROM AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ARE IN HERE BUT FOR SERVICE PARK SERVICE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT. EVEN OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS THAT WE WORK WITH AND OF COURSE THE GREAT COLLABORATION WITH CAL FIRE. WE ALL BRING RESOURCES TO THE TABLE. AND WE ALL NEED THOSE RESOURCES AT SOMETIMES. AND AS SAID OFTEN DURING THOSE SAPONINS TESTIMONY RESOURCES NEED TO GET THEIR QUICK THEY NEED TO BE ORDER QUICKLY THE INCIDENT NEEDS TO BE ORGANIZED BUT IT'S A COLLABORATION. PREPARATION PRE POSITIONING HAS BEEN MENTIONED I MANAGE THE PRE POSITIONING PROGRAM AND WE PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH PRE POSITIONED HUNDREDS OF TIMES. THERE'S ONLY BEEN TO DIALS A PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES ARE RESOURCE REQUEST OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAM. BUT THAT HAS LED TO SMALLER FIRES THAT YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT. DURING LAST TALK POWER SHUT OFF IN EXTREME FIRE WEATHER EVENT AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE WERE SIXTY FOUR PRE POSITIONED STRIKE TEAMS ARE HELICOPTERS BULLDOZERS EVER THE NEED WAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS A RESOURCE WENT OF FIRES WE WERE BACK FELONIES RESOURCES. DURATION IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS AND THEN TECHNOLOGY I CAN'T I CAN'T STRESS TECHNOLOGY ENOUGH IT WAS TALKED ABOUT BY. EVERYBODY WHO'S BEEN BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I WILL TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY HE- HOW WE USE TO OUR G. TO VALIDATE FIRES THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THE RESPONSE. THAT HOME EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT OUR CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND HOW IT OPERATES WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INTO A SYSTEM THAT WAS BORN OUT OF DISASTERS. AND EXPANDED INTO THIS ALL HAZARD CAPABILITY. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF MUTUAL AID ASSETS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY FIRE ENGINES AND FIREFIGHTERS BUT WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID WE HAVE EMERGENCY MEDICAL MUTUAL AID WE HAVE ALL OF THESE ASSETS. AND WE HAVE PLANS IN AGREEMENTS. THE MASTER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT WHICH IS SIGNED BY EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LITERARY EVERY THE A SIGNED THAT AGREEMENT. FOUNDATION FOR MUTUAL AID OPERATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE AND RESCUE EMERGENCY MUTUALLY POWELL PLAN THAT EXISTS TODAY IS A COMPONENT OF THAT MASTER MUTUAL AREEMENT AND THE STATE'S EMERGENCY. A PLAN. THESE WERE ADOPTED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A PROGRESSIVE STATE OF COURSE WE SEE MORE DISASTERS THAN ANYBODY BUT THE PLAN IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR. GOING BACK AND FORTH JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES THEY ONLY EXIST ON A MAP THEY DON'T EXIST IN MUTUAL AID EVERYBODY HELPS EVERYBODY. AND SOMETIMES WE DO IT FOR VERY MASTER MUTUAL AID WITH NO EXPECTATION OF REIMBURSEMENT. LET ME GO INTO THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH DURING THE RIDGE CREST EARTH QUAKE WE CALLED FIRE CHIEF THAT WERE BEHIND US THAT ARE SITTING BEHIND US TODAY AND ASK THEM TO SEPARATE PURSES FROM AID TO CITY OF RIDGECREST WITH NO EXPECTATION A REIMBURSEMENT. THERE WAS NO HESITATION THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THE MASTER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT AND STANDARDIZE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ARE DESIGNED AND LEVERAGE TO RESPOND ALL HAZARDS I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH EVEN THE CAMP FIRE WHICH BURNED. SIGNIFICANT HOMESLOSS OF LIFE THERE WAS STILL RECOVERY EFFORT AFTER THAT AND THAT'S WHERE THE URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE SYSTEM RESPONDED. TO THIS ALL HAZARD MUTUAL AID PLAN. AND AGAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT HOMELAND SECURITY FIRE AND RESCUE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL EVEN PUBLIC WORKS WE ALL ARE RESPONDING IN SUPPORT OF MUTUAL AID. SO HOW DOES THIS WORK. THE WRITTEN REQUEST FOR RESOURCES FOR RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY THAT IS A BE ON THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN IT TO YOU TO CONTROL ARE INITIATED THROUGH THE- THEM. GOVERNMENTS ARE SET UP. TO RESPOND TO THE DAY TODAY. BUT WHEN YOU END UP WITH A LOOSELY FIRE A CAMPFIRE. THAT'S BEYOND NORMAL DAY TO DAY. REQUESTS ARE FILLED BY THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE RESOURCES. REMEMBER CALIFORNIA'S BIG STATE SO IF YOU HAVE THE CAMP FIRE BURNING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE MAY BE RESOURCES COMING OUT OF SAN DIEGO. MULTIPLE FIRES ACROSS CALIFORNIA CHALLENGED THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN IS A BIG STATE. OUR FIRE ENGINES ARE WATER TENDERS TO THE STATE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM ARE THE MOST UTILIZE RESOURCES IN MUTUAL AID. WATER TENDERS ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING-THAT WATER TO THE SCENE BECAUSE THESE FIRES ARE OCCURRING IN RULE AREAS AND AS WE FACE LAST SUMMER THE POWER WAS SHUT OFF WHICH AFFECTED OUR WATER SUPPLY. FIRE ENGINES THERE IN EVERY FIRE STATION THERE'S MULTIPLE TYPES AND THEY'RE RESPONDING TO ASSIST ANSWERING THE CALL OF HELP. THE REQUESTING AN ANTI SHOULD MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF THE EQUIPMENT FACILITIES AND SERVICES DURING THE PERIOD OF EMERGENCY. THE RECORDING ENTITIES HELP OFFSET THE EXTREME BURDEN AS FAR UNITS COME INTO- THE EMERGENCY. BUT WITH. FIRE AGENCIES LIKE CAL FIRE IN OUR LARGER FIRE AGENCIES THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT TO SUPPORT THE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES THAT CUT. AND ONCE THE INCIDENT IS MITIGATED THOSE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES ARE RELEASED. FEDERAL FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES THEIR CONTRACTORS SUBCONTRACTORS ARE NOT PART OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THOUGH. THOSE RESOURCES ARE CALLED UP THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS SUCH AS THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT OR EMAIL CAN ALL TALK ABOUT IT. SCHOOL OPERATE. HELLO YES FIRE AND RESCUE. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. AS MENTIONED THE STATE'S BROKEN INTO SIX DIFFERENT MUTUAL AID RESERVE REGION'S. I AM INVOLVES MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FIRE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PAID PROFESSIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS WHICH MAKE UP OVER 30% OF OUR FIRE FIGHTING FORCE IN COMBINATION FIRE DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAVE VOLUNTEERS AND PAID FIREFIGHTERS. AND THE PLEDGE TO ASSIST WITH THE MUTUAL AID TO THE MOBILIZATION THEIR RESOURCES. THE FIERY USED TOGETHER WITH CARILLO YES OWN MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND ALL RESPIRE ENGINES. CALORIE US PROVIDES FIRE ENGINES ALSO. WE GIVE FIRE ENGINES THROUGH AN AGREEMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND WHEN WE TALKED THIS AFTERNOON WITH MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES TALK THEY TALKED ABOUT NEEDING MORE FIRE ENGINES. ME TELL YOU WHAT TYPE THREE FIRE ENGINES WHICH ARE EXPANSION FIRE ENGINES TO THE YES FLEET ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW TO HAVE JUST ARRIVED IN SAN BRUNO. SEVENTY NOT TIED SIX FIRE ENGINES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THIS TIME. I AM WILL BE IN SERVICE. IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. THOSE TYPE SIX FIRE ENGINES ARE ALSO ALL HAZARD. AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE ENGINES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. THE FIVE FIVE HUNDRED FIRE ENGINES CAN BE MOBILIZED ANYWHERE WITHIN CALIFORNIA WITH FIRST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THE NEXT FIVE UPPER FIRE ENGINES CAN BE MOBILIZED ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX HOURS. AND I'VE BEEN ON THOSE FIRE ENGINES AS A FIREFIGHTER I RESPONDED TO THE CEDAR FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND- SAN DIEGO. AND I COULD TELL YOU THE CONFERENCE CALLS THAT WERE OCCURRING IS THAT FIRE WAS BURNING AND BURNING HOUSES. AND DESTROYING LIVES WAS SEND EVERYTHING YOU CAN AND THE CALIFORNIA FIRES SERVICE. THEY ANSWERED THAT CALL. FIRE ENGINES WERE ON THE ROAD RESPONDING. YOU'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES IN YOUR DISTRICT HOW THE CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND AGAIN BOTH BAR- AND RESCUE LAW ENFORCEMENT HOMELAND SECURITY EMS HAVE BEEN PUT TO DEATH PUT TO THE TEST. IN SEVENTEEN AFTER THE SUMMER FIRES ALONG THE CALIFORNIA OREGON BORDER IN IN THE CENTRAL PART OF OUR STATE. OVER ONE AND- IS BROKE OUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL THE WAY FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH OVER FOUR HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS FROM AROUND THE STATE WERE MOBILIZED. OVER TWO HUNDRED FIRE ENGINES FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA RESPONDED TO OUR CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE. EVEN FIREFIGHTERS FROM US AUSTRALIA. AND WE RECIPROCATE WITH THAT HELP AS CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE IN AUSTRALIA RIGHT NOW. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CARILLO YES COORDINATED ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND RESOURCES THROUGH OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. TO BATTLE THE JULY FIRE CAR MENDOCINO. EIGHTY FIRE ENGINES WERE BROUGHT IN FROM OUT OF STATE FOR THAT OF AN- FOR THE NUMBER NOVEMBER FIRES. CAMP HILL AND LOOSELY WHICH ARE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ENGINES WERE BROUGHT IN TO THE STATE. AND AGAIN IT TAKES TIME TO GET THOSE RESOURCES IN. BUT ONE KEY POINT. THESE FIRES ARE BURNING NOW WHAT'S GOOD TO BE BURNING IT OUR- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE NOBODY HAS A CRYSTAL BALL IN THE CALIFORNIA FIRES THIS. THESE FIRE ENGINES ARE COMING IN. SOME OF THEM GO DIRECTLY TO THE FIRE SUMMER STAGE SO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL SURGE CAPACITY SHOULD MORE FIRES BREAK OUT. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS CAL FIRE TESTED. WAS MORE THAN A NORMAL FIRE YEAR. HOW EVER IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE SAW A FLURRY OF FIRE ACTIVITY IN OCTOBER. AND AGAIN POWER SHUT OFF DO NOT HAPPEN FIRST IT'S THE FIRE WEATHER OF THAT THAT DRIVES POWER SHOW OFFS AND NEARLY AT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS IN A FIRE WEATHER OF. AS MENTIONED THE SAP WHICH FIRE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT TWENTY FIVE STRUCTURES AND LEAD TO ONE CIVILIAN FATALITY. EIGHT OF OUR FIRES WERE INJURED. THE TECH FIRE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN ACRES TWENTY TWO STRUCTURES DESTROYED THE EASY FIVE ARE INVENTOR A- EIGHTEEN HER ACRES BURNED AND THREATEN THE RONALD REAGAN LIBRARY. AND THEN THEY CAN KATE FIRE AND SONOMA COUNTY. SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR STRUCTURES. WE BEGAN AUGMENTING OUR- PROCESS OF ORDERING RESOURCES. PRE POSITIONING IS AN AMAZING PROGRAM. WE'RE NOT ONLY DOING IT WIN MORE CALL BY A FIRE DEPARTMENT OR AN OPERATIONAL AREA WE'RE LEANING FORWARD WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WEATHER OUT IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE EXCELLENT TECHNOLOGY THAT TELLS US WHAT THE WEATHER'S GOING TO BE AND WE WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO PRE POSITION THESE RESOURCES IT ALLOWS FOR RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF THESE FIRE ASSETS WHEN THE FIRE SMALL. AS A PROFESSIONAL OUR FIGHTERS IN THE ROM CAN ATTEST IF YOU KEEP THE FIRE SMALL IT'S EASIER TO CONTAINED. THE SOBRE ALMOST FIRE IN MONTEREY COUNTY. IT WAS SO BIG IT BURNED FROM JULY TO OCTOBER. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. HELLO IS FILLED RESCUE MUTUAL AID REQUEST EXCUSE ME THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ONLY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE WERE IN NINETEEN. AND A LOT OF THAT WAS DUE TO THE PRE POSITIONING SUCCESS. AS I MENTIONED REPOSITIONING IS PART OF OUR PREPARATION IT BOLSTERS THE LOCAL RESPONSE AND ANY FIRE CHIEF THAT'S USING THIS PROGRAM THEY KNOW THE VALUE OF IT. WE'RE NOT ONLY VOWED PRE POSITIONING FIRE ENGINES WERE PRE POSITIONING HELICOPTERS HAND CREWS BULLDOZERS AND WE DO IT ALSO FOR THE MUD AND DEBRIS YOU FLOWS THAT OCCUR. AFTER THE FIRES THANK GOODNESS WE HAVEN'T HAD EXTREME WINTER STORMS THIS YEAR WITH ALL OF THE LANDS BURNED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS PRE POSITIONING ALLOW QUICK REACTION TIMES TO AN INCIDENT IT MITIGATES THE DISASTER TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE CONDITIONS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS. I RECEIVED THE LETTERS I'VE HAD THE PHONE CALLS THE REASSURANCE TO THE COMMUNITY TO SEE THOSE EXTRA FIRE ENGINES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES KNOWING THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR A QUICK RESPONSE ISRAEL ASSURING TO THE COMMUNITY. PREPOSITIONING WE USE THE FIRE WEATHER THE FIRE DANGER AND FUELS LEVEL AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WE KNOW. ONE THING WE KNOW THERE'S MICRO COMMUNITY CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE PRISON PRE POSITIONED MOST IS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. BECAUSE SANTA BARBARA HAS A CONDITION CALLED SUNDOWNERS. AND WE WORK WITH SANTA BARBARA COUNTY TO PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES ALMOST ON A REGULAR BASIS. SINCE JULY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALLOW YES IS AT TWO HUNDRED AND THREE PRE POSITION APPROVALS AND TO NILES. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PRE POSITION REQUEST. AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE APPROVED PRE POSITION REQUEST. SO LET ME TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND GAPS THAT EXIST IN OUR CURRENT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM BUT WE ACT HELLO YES SIR JUST IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WITH A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES PROGRAMS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THESE CHALLENGES TO MUTUAL AID SYSTEM ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE DIET DOWNSIZING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS AS THE RESULT OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINE RECESSION. SO WE'RE IMPLEMENTING A NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS. AGAIN THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES IN THE EVENT OF PROJECTED WHETHER. USING TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS SCOUT TO IMPROVE OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN YES NO FIREFIGHTER RESPONDING FROM OUTSIDE THEIR JURISDICTION TO HELP ANOTHER COMMUNITY SHOULD BE IN THE DARK. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SHOULD COME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. WE'RE USING A FIRE INTEGRATED REAL TIME INTELLIGENCE PILOT PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT'S REAL TIME DATA FROM AN AIRCRAFT. THAT IS LAUNCHED ON INITIAL ATTACK AND I CAN TELL YOU WHEN THE MARIE A FIRE WAS BURNING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VENTURA WE WERE GETTING REAL TIME DATA. AND HAVING REAL TIME DATA ON WHAT THE FIRE WAS DOING. THERE WAS AN F. MAC WHICH IS A FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANT. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS 75% BY HAVING THAT REAL TIME DATA WE'RE ABLE TO JUST TELL OUR STORY TO FEMA. AND GET APPROVALS OF THESE F. MAX WHICH HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM BEARING COST OF FIRES. A NEW PILOT PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN REGION ONE LOS ANGELES. WE ARE USING A PROGRAM THAT WAS MITCHELL. EXCUSE ME WERE FIRED HIS PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THEIR NEIGHBORING FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE ORANGE COUNTY PART OF JESUS TOLD ME I HAVE EIGHTY FIRE ENGINES. I WILL SEND FORTY PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL ME WE'VE INITIATED THIS PROGRAM IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM AND IT'S UNDER. UNDER A REAL WORLD TEST IN pABLE TO MOVE FIRE ENGINES. AND HELICOPTERS TO RAPIDLY SPREADING WILDLAND FIRE SANTA ANA DRIVEN WIND DRIVEN FIRES ARE BURNING STRUCTURES BY PICKING UP THE PHONE. BUT WE STILL PUT IT IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A MUTUAL AID REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS WHEN THEY SEND THEIR FIREFIGHTERS OUT THE DOOR THEY'RE BEARING THE COST TO PAY THOSE FIREFIGHTERS UNTIL THE REIMBURSEMENT GETS. BACK IN THE BANK WE'RE WORKING ON THIS PROGRAM WHICH WILL HELP TO SPEED UP REIMBURSEMENT AND ALSO MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE STATE. I AM PROUD TO SAY AND THE CURRENT BUDGET. WE HAVE INTEL MOBILIZATION DIVISION THAT'S BEING BUILT AT- YES FIRE AND RESCUE RIGHT NOW. IT'LL PROVIDE REAL TIME DATA IN REAL TIME MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES. WHERE THE PROBLEM OF REPEAT REGION STAFFING WAS MENTIONED WE WILL HAVE YES FIRE AND RESCUE DISPATCHERS ADDO YES HEADQUARTERS THAT WILL HELP TO MOBILIZE THESE RESOURCES. MORE STAFFING IS PROPOSED IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THE STAFFING NECESSARY IN THIS INTEL MOBILIZATION CENTER. WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW TO HAVE A MUTUAL AID INTERCOM SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS MENTIONED ROSS IS SOMEWHAT STIFLING TO THE ORDERING PROCESS AGING GETTING ON AN INTERCOM FOR THE LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT SAY WE HAVE A THE WOOZY FIRE JUST BROKE OUT AND WE NEED FIFTY FIRE ENGINES RIGHT NOW. ANY FIRED UP MEANT COULD HEAR THAT. ANY FARBER MAKE IT HERE THAT AND GO HEY I'M SAN AND TO STRIKE TEAMS RIGHT NOW. WE DO IT RIGHT NOW FOR AIRCRAFT. LET'S DO IT FOR FIRE ENGINES. AS MENTIONED- IROC SYSTEM COMING ONLINE. THERE'S OTHER SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SUCH AS EN MASSE AND AS CHIEF TYLER SAID WHEN ROSS WAS PUT IN WE DIDN'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. CAN I HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE SEAT AT THE TABLE SO WE ARE COMING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW TO. WORK WITH CAL FIRE TO HELP BUILD THAT CAPABILITY IN. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REAL TIME INTELLIGENCE. REAL TIME RESOURCES STATUS SAYING AVIELLE WAS MENTIONED. EVERY YES FIRE ENGINE AS A DEAL ON IT. SOME OF THEM HAVE VERIZON ALL OF THEM ARE BEING SWITCHED OUT TO EIGHTEEN T. FIRST MET. AND I CAN TELL YOU IS THE KERN COUNTY FIRE CHIEF WE HAD EIGHTEEN T. FIRST IN A IN KERN COUNTY BY CHIEF OFFICER ADDED ON THEIR PHONE. AND YES THE GOAL IS TO GET A VIDEO ON EVERY FIRE ENGINE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AS WE SPEAK. AS MENTIONED REASON. ROSS IS KIND OF A- IT'S TIME IS THE PROCESS WE CAN GIVE YOU A AN ANALOGY IMAGINE YOU TOOK TWO FINALS AND PUT THE SMALL ENDS TOGETHER. ALL THE RESOURCE REQUEST GOING IN ON TOP ANY GETS BOTTLE NECK RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. AS IT GOES OUT TO DIFFERENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS FILL OUT ORDER AND WHEN THE ORDERS ARE FILLED THE COME OUT OF THE BOTTOM THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH WITH ROSS. WE'RE USING A PROGRAM RIGHT NOW. THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE BORDER DIRECTORS FOR FIRE SCHOOL VOTED ON IT RECENTLY IT'S A REAL TIME MAX FOUR OH FIVE MAX STANDS FOR MULTI AGENCY COORDINATION. FIRED APART FOR PUTTING IN THEIR AVAILABLE RESOURCES. AND THEY MANAGE IT ON A DAILY BASIS AN HOURLY BASIS. BY INCIDENT BASIS SO WE KNOW FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID INSTITUTE THIS PROGRAM. HOW MANY FIRE ENGINES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE SYSTEM IN ANY GIVEN TIME. THAT'S REAL TIME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON A FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR CALLAWAY AS FIRE AND RESCUE. WE DEFINITELY NEED A PLAN GOING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE. YOU CAN THROW ALL THE MONEY THAT IS BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN ON HOW TO EXECUTE WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE WE WILL FAIL. THIS PLAN SHOULD BE A DOCUMENTED AND IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN BY JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH CAL FIRE ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE. WHERE ARE THE FIRE ENGINES IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE ARE THE FIRE STATIONS. WHERE ARE THE OVER ONE THOUSAND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS. THIS SURVEY IS BEEN DEVELOPED AND SENT OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA FIRES SERVICE THEY'RE RETURNING THAT SURVEY. AND WE WILL HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM NOT ONLY FIRE ENGINES BUT SPECIALIZE RESOURCES SUCH AS URBAN SEARCH RESCUE AND HAS MATT. WE'RE WORKING ON A JOINT G. I. S. DATABASE. THAT WILL ALLOW THE MANIPULATION OF DATA. SO WE KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE. WHERE IT'S AT AND THOSE WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE WE CAN DO IMPROVEMENTS AN AUGMENTATION. TO BOLSTER THE CALIFORNIA FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. WE HAD A PLAN THE PLAN STILL OF OURS CALLED THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT. IT WAS BORN OUT OF THOUSAND THREE FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE FIRES GO BOARD OF THE DIRECTORS TO REVISIT THIS VITAL REPORT ON THE CALIFORNIA FIRES SERVICE. SOME THINGS A BIT COMPLETED THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION IN THERE FOR. CALIFORNICA IT MORE HELICOPTERS BETTER HELICOPTERS THAT RECOMMENDATION IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW LET'S SEE WHAT'S VALID IN THERE LET'S SEE WHAT WE NEED TO ADD BUT THIS IS A GUIDING DOCUMENT AND WE AT- YES ARE WORKING AGAIN TO THE FIRE SCHOOL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REACH THIS STUFF. YOU CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS IN PERFECT PREPARING FOR RESPONDING TO AN RECEIVING. AND RECOVERING FROM ALL FORMS A NATURAL IN TECHNOLOGY- TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS. MUTUAL AID SYSTEM PROVIDED HELP TO THE OROVILLE DAM WHEN WE HAD A POTENTIAL FOR FAILURE. MUTUAL AID SYSTEMS THERE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THESE COMMENTS AND ALL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU IF YOU THOUGHT. MEMBERS SHARE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVING SEEN THE GREAT WORK THE CALLOW YES DOES ON ON. COORDINATING AND HELPING PARTICIPATE IN THESE EVENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH. I DIDN'T HEAR AN ANSWER TO THE CONCERNS THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ON THIS MUTUAL AID IS THAT INITIAL ASK. SO ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT. THAT THE LOCALS WILL BE OR SHOULD BE CALLING- YES AND THAT YOU WILL THEN. BY VIRTUE OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR WHAT HAVE YOU BE IDENTIFYING THOSE OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT SHOULD BE- SENDING ASSISTANCE. OF BECAUSE I JUST THE I KNOW WHAT YOU DO AND I KNOW YOU DO A GREAT JOB BUT THE FOCUS HERE FROM THE CONVERSATION SAID I. WAS HEARING EARLIER IS THAT. THOSE INITIAL MOMENTS THOSE INITIAL FIRST FEW HOURS. ARE WHERE THE DELAY IS AND- THAT'S- ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO CLOSE IT OUT. THE AYE THE- I. I COAST WHATEVER THE AYE ROQUE IROC SYSTEM- REPLACING THE ROSS SYSTEM IS WHAT I GUESS WERE HOPING IS GOING TO WORK BUT- THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER THE FIRST PART. WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE LAW THE ROLE OF- YES IN TRYING TO REDUCE THAT TIME FRAME AND GET THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP LOCALS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO IN THE CASE OF A WILDLAND FIRE IN THIS IS JUST ONE FIRE THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE STATE. THE JURISDICTION BEGINS PLACING ORDERS IN THE OPERATIONAL AREA AND THOSE ARE TYPICALLY THE COUNTY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MULTIPLE OPERATIONAL AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN REGION ONE AND THEN THE TAHOE BASIN. SO THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED LOCAL JURISDICTION TECH COUNTY WHICH SYSTEM WE TALK ABOUT THE PHARMACY MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO GET HELP THANK YOU SO YOU ORDER OBVIOUSLY LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY IF THAT INCIDENT. EXCEEDS THEIR CAPABILITY THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE SURROUNDING FIRE DEPARTMENTS FOR HELP RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE RESOURCE AS IT CONTINUES TO ESCALATE THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR LOCAL OPERATIONAL AREA THAT COUNTY IF YOU WILL FOR HELP AND RESOURCES ARE COMING. AS THE INCIDENT EEK SCAPES THAT INITIAL ATTACK AND BECOMES LARGER WE GO TO THE REGION THERE SIX REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE CLOSE IS RESOURCES BEGIN THE RESPONDED INCIDENT. ONCE AT REGION IS TAPPED OUT AND THERE'S NO MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE THEN IT COMES TO THE STATE. AND WE START. PUTTING RESOURCE REQUEST TO OTHER REGIONS. OBVIOUSLY AGAIN THE CLOSER THE RESOURCE THE QUICKER THE RESPONSE SO WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE RESOURCES QUICKLY. IT ALL GOES INTO A SYSTEM AS I MENTIONED THE FINAL HE GETS INTO THAT MIDDLE OF THE FINAL WORD THE WORD- IT SLOWS DOWN. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO A FIRE DEPARTMENT YOU CALL UP THE LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT YOU SAY I NEED A STRIKE TEAM OF FIRE ENGINES LA COUNTY MAY BE ABLE TO FILL IT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO FILL IT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE- BUSINESS. AND THEIR FIRE. THIS USING THIS LIVE FOUR OH FIVE SYSTEM SO WE KNOW THAT LA COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE A STRIKE TEAM OF FIRE ENGINES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO LA COUNTY WE GO RIGHT TELL THE CITY BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY HAVE IT AVAILABLE. WE YES SIR IS WE THE LOCALS IT'S ANYBODY USING THE SYSTEM THIS SYSTEM IS NOT OVER YES PROPRIETARY IT'S FOR THE SYSTEM SO THESE DISPATCH CENTERS. HAVE A- THEY CAN LOOK ON IT AND THEY KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR SURROUNDING AREAS BECAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR INFORMATION AND ALSO. SO DOES THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW ORDERS MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM WELL IS THAT HOW THEY CURRENTLY DO BECAUSE CLEARLY WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING IS WORKING TOO SLOWLY AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED THAT. WHAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS TOO SLOW AND IT TO AND I KNOW THAT IN A NUMBER OF FIRES IT'S TAKING WAY TOO LONG FOR THE AID TO COME TO THEM ONE SIX IT'S GREAT BUT THAT THAT KEY CRITICAL. WE MALL IS THE- SO BUILDING THE TELL MOM IS ASIAN UNIT AT O. S. TO TRY TO INCREASE THE STAFFING TO HELP MOBILIZE RESOURCES. BECAUSE STAFFING IN THE REGION DISPATCH CENTERS AS WAS MENTIONED. IS ONE OF THE ISSUES. THIS VETS DISPATCH CENTERS ARE STAFFED BASED ON WHAT THEIR DAILY NEEDS ARE WHEN YOU HAVE A WOODLEY FIRE THAT'S NOT THE NORMAL STAFFING. THAT DISPATCH CENTER THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE SO WE'RE TRYING TO BOLSTER THAT RIGHT NOW AND IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. TRANSACTION THAT THAT WILL HELP GET MORE DISPATCHERS TO HELP PROCESS ORDERS AND GET THEM MOVING SO THIS ARE A SYSTEM- I WAS VERY CONCERNED TO HEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN NO. TRAINING AT THIS POINT IN TIME FOR LOCALS AND THAT THE SYSTEM THERE'S GOING TO BE A WEEK GAPS SO WE ALL HAVE TO HOPE AND PRAY WE DON'T HAVE A MAJOR EVENT DURING. WE EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC. I GOT TO TELL YOU I AM. REALLY CONCERNED. THAT NOW WE KNOW. THAT THE AT LEAST IF THIS IS ACCURATE THAT WOULD WE HAVEN'T TRAINED ANY THE LOCALS. ON THE USE OF THE SYSTEM. AND THAT THERE'S A WEEK BETWEEN WHEN THE ROSS SYSTEM IS CLOSED IS TURNED OFF AND THE IRA AND THE IRAQ SYSTEM. IS IN PLACE COULD YOU PLEASE HELP. CLARIFY THAT SITUATION I MEAN IT'S SO. I KNOW THE FEDS OR SOMEONE INVOLVED BUT- WE'RE IN THE ETHER ARE THEY WITH YOU THEY'RE NOT HERE AND I KNOW THE FEDS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL BUT- THESE ARE OUR FIRES WHO'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE HOW WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING THAT WE ARE HELP THOSE PEOPLE IT THERE IS IN FACT THE FIRE. THE SYSTEMS NATIONAL AND FOR THAT ONE BECAUSE OPERATIONAL WE HAVE PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO USE IT. THANK YOU MADAM I SHARE- SO- CHIEF MARSHALL TALKED ABOUT THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF HAVE AN ORDER IS PLACED. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TRANSITION. FROM ROSS THE IRAQ LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT GAP FIRST. SO EVERY CENTER SHOULD HAVE I WOULD HOPE WOULD HAVE A CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PLAN. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE THEIR NINE ONE ONE CENTER IF THE POWER GOES OUT IF AN EMERGENCY HAPPENS THEY SHOULD HAVE A BACKUP PLAN. SO WHAT WE WOULD HOPE IS THAT SPECIFIC TO ROB US THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE FAMILIAR WITH AND EXERCISING THEIR BACKUP PLAN HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST FOREMOST EVERY DISPATCH CENTER HAS A COMPUTED IT COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH CENTER HAD HAD HS A COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM A CAD SYSTEM IF YOU WILL. THEY'RE ABLE TO DISPATCH THEIR RESOURCES AND IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE THOSE CATS SYSTEMS CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY CAN TALK CROSS JURISDICTIONAL- AND GO CAT THE CAT. OTHER TIMES THEY CAN'T BUT SPECIFICALLY WERE TALKING ABOUT ROSS SO pIS LARGE ENOUGH THAT ROSS WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED DURING THIS BLACKOUT PERIOD YOU HAVE DISPATCHER IN ORDER STE. DEAF OR WISHING UNITS THAT WHO ADDRESSING AND TRACKING THOSE RESOURCES ON WHAT WE CALL ONE A ONE CARDS ARE SOURCE ORDER CARDS THEY CAN ALSO BE TRACKED ON TWO CARDS. FROM THERE. THE TELEPHONE OR RADIO IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE. TO TALK THROUGH THOSE OP AREAS TALK TO THE DISPATCH CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT BLACKOUT PERIOD THAT PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS NOW WE KNOW THAT AS I SAID NGUYEN THAT IRAQ SYSTEM COMES UP SEVEN DAYS LATER THERE WILL HAVE BEEN NO% TRAINING SO FOR ME TO SAY THAT THIS THIS CONTINUITY OF OPERATION PLAN IS ONLY GOING TO LAST FOR SEVEN DAYS IT WILL LAST LONGER THAN SEVEN DAYS WHY HAVEN'T PEOPLE BEEN TRAINED ON THE- BECAUSE- FEDERAL. IS WHO ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IRAQ WHICH BY THE WAY IS A FREE SYSTEM TO CALIFORNIA- HAVE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED. ALL OF THE TRAINING COMPONENTS THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON WE'RE ACTIVELY SPEAKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS EXPRESSING THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE EXPRESSING TODAY. WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF MR TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO GET BACK IN CALIFORNIA BUT I JUST HOPE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME OR SUBSEQUENTLY THERE TOO SO- I IT'S MY HOPE AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP EXPEDITE THAT BUT THIS IS. OF CONCERN IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO SORT OF THE OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS YOU KNOW. THE CHURCH BELLS RINGING WHEN THERE'S AN EMERGENCY. AND AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT. YOUR YOUR YOR CAR WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR NEAREST STARBUCKS IS. BECAUSE WE ARE TRACKED. BY AND OVER- AGAIN- EXPERTS EXAMINED- BY TECHNOLOGY AND YET WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM UP THAT'S GOING TO HELP FACILITATE AND EXPEDITE. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BECAUSE THE FEDS HAVEN'T COMPLETED THEIR- ROLE LIVE CHAT- DEBTS. WHICH IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING. AB OF PERHAPS I'M NOT SAYING TO THE STATE BUT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE AND- IF PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE SOME OFFLINE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO AYE I'D CERTAINLY. BE DELIGHTED OR WE CAN SEND MY COLLEAGUE HERE TO RAISE HOLY HELL. IN CONGRESS AND WITH THAT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TEST. SENATOR DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR GALGIANI. OUR GERMAN THANK YOU I HAVE ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL IN AND I THINK THEY GO MORE TO JUST- DATA AND QUESTIONS ON ON SOME OF THE NUMBERS YOU PRESENT IT'S I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THERE IS A PLAN TO ADD STOPPING IN THE NUMBER OF SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN. ADDITIONAL MANPOWER RESOURCES- I'M ASSUMING THOUGH THAT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED IN THE TRAINING PLAN THAT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE OUTSIDE OF THAT AND WHAT THAT DEPLOYMENT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS OUT WHICH IS STILL YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AND FIRE TERMS NOW WE KNOW THAT'S- WHAT ACRES. UP I HAVE. BEEN DONE. STATEWIDE TO AT LEAST TRY TO FIGURE OUT A NUMBER OF WHAT THAT STAFFING. NEED WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE WERE ADDRESSING. MAN HOURS AS THEY'VE BEEN ROLLED OUT OVER THESE LAST SEVERAL FIRE YEARS IT FOR INSTANCE IN AN IDEAL NUMBER. WOULD BE SIX SEVENTY SEVEN A GOOD STARTING PLACE BUT WE GOT TO NINE HUNDRED WE'D REALLY BE MEETING WHAT WE KNOW IS AN UNMET NEED BECAUSE THAT KIND OF CALCULATION BEEN MADE. SO I WANT TO BE. CLEAR THANK YOU ASKING A QUESTION. THAT NUMBER REFERRING TO A SPECIFICALLY TO CAL FIRE. SUPPORT BOTH. IN THE CHIEF HERE HEAD. JUST ABOUT HELLFIRE IT'S ABOUT SO THE ENTIRE FIRE SERVICE PROGRAM ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA SO SPECIFIC TO CAL FIRE- WE HAVE STAFFING ALLOCATION GUIDELINES- TO MEET OUR NEEDS- THE STAFF BEHIND ME THAT ARE HERE TO SUPPORT TODAY- HAVE USED METHODOLOGY IS TURMAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT- SICK LEAVE YOU LOOK AT WORKERS COMPENSATION YOU LOOK A VACATION YOU LOOK AT- HOLIDAYS THOSE TYPES OF. METHODS IT BRINGS US TO A POINT OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT- FIRE% ENGINE- HELLO ATTACK IN AIRCRAFT CAPABILITIES- LOOKING INTO AN ANALYSIS AND ALICE'S DEEPER OF WHAT WE COULD NEED FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. OR LOOKING AT THE PAST SIX YEARS- WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THAT- AND I THINK THAT LOOKING AT THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO THAT AS WELL. YEAH A GREAT I THINK THAT'S A NEEDS ASSESSMENT WE NEED TO START HAVING THAT NUMBER IN OUR HEAD WHEN WE CONCEPTUALIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE IN. BUDGET YOU'RE SEEN FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WHERE WE- STAY BUDGET WE BASS. DEPLOYED MAKE SURE THE WERE WERE MATCHING. NEED AND THEN CHIEF TO YOUR POINT APPRECIATE A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU SAID FIRST F ALL- OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS TO ADDRESS ALL HAZARDS IN A QUESTION THAT COMES UP TO ME ALL THE TIME IS. YOU KNOW. FOR LACK OF YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T WANNA BE- CRISIS AT. GET INTO TO HAVE OUR CRISES BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY ARE CONCERNED ALWAYS ABOUT- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AN EARTHQUAKE HITS. AND WE ALSO A MAJOR FIRE EVENTS GOING ON IN THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME- SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE OBVIOUSLY GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO THAT THE DEPLOYMENT AYE I WATCHED YOU KNOW FROM AFAR FOR THE RIDGECREST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY REMARKABLE DEPLOYMENT- BUT PERHAPS IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT WHAT PART OF THE FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLANNING- ARE YOU GUYS GIVING BACK CONSIDERATION TO NOW THAT WE KNOW FIRE SEASON. AROUND WE ALSO A QUICK AS A YEAR RISK A- MERRY THE- TWO CONCERNS I THEN SECONDARY TALKED ABOUT. THE NEW ENGINES COMING ONLINE WHICH I FIND REALLY HEARTENING THAT'S GREAT WITH THE YOU KNOW EARLIER PANEL SPOKE TO THE NEED FOR ENGINES. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF A REGIONAL. DEPLOYMENT OF THOSE RESOURCES WHERE PERHAPS THAT TRAVEL TIME THAT RESPONSE TIME. IS RESOURCES ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO US. SO LET ME TAKE THAT QUESTION FOR SO WE ARE OUT RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TO BECOME AN ASSIGNEE OF THOSE FIRE APPARATUS. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT THE GAPS ARE IN COVERAGE. AND WHO CAN SUPPORT- THE STRIKE TEAMS AT THESE FIRE ENGINES SO I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEF AND HIS OPERATIONAL AREA ONCE FIVE OF THESE FIRE ENGINES SO IT'S IN A GOOD. TEN AREA AS FIRES IN A IN AN AREA THAT YOU WOULD A RESPONDED TO THE WAS THE FIRE IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT GAPS IN WHO CAN SUPPORT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS STAFFING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- YEAH YOU CAN PUT ALL THE FIRE TRUCKS IN THE WORLD YOU WANT OR YOU CAN. BUT HAVING THE STAFFING TO SEND THOSE FIRE TRUCKS OUT THE DOOR WHEN THE NEED IS THERE IS SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE STAFFING IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A GAP ANALYSIS AND WE'LL GET THOSE FIRE ENGINES OUT. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKES FLOODS FIRES. NOT JUST WILDLAND FIRES BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING- SUCH AS A REFINERY FIRE THOSE YOU KNOW. THOSE EVENTS SAID END UP ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER AND THE LEAD STORY ON THE NEWS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR AND THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR YES FIRE AND RESCUE WE'RE LOOKING AT WERE THOSE GAPS ARE AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. UP IN THE URBAN SURGERY Q. SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF IT WE USED A LOT OF THOSE COMPONENTS IN. RIDGECREST BUT LET'S SAY WE HAVE THE BIG EARTHQUAKE SEVEN CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING HELP FROM MAYBE INTERNATIONAL. HAVING A SEAMLESS PROGRAM FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE BECAUSE OF I'VE SAID DURING MY CAREER AS A AS A FIRE CHIEF FOR KERN COUNTY AND AS I SAY NOW. THERE'S SMOKE IN THE AIR IT'S TOO LATE. GOT TO HAVE THOSE PLANS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING AND WE'RE COLLABORATING THE FIRE SCOPE BORDER DIRECTORS AND THE AND THE GROUPS THAT WORK UNDER THAT. REALLY PROVIDE THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE LEADERS AND BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP PLANS AND- AND TECHNOLOGIES AND GET THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE AGAIN JUST SCHEME WAS. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SYSTEM LET'S JUST MAKE IT BETTER. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO- PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE HAS ANYTHING.
