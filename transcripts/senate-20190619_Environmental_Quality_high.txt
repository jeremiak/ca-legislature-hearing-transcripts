ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE CVR PIECE TO HELP CLEAN THE AIR IN THE AREAS OF THE STATE. WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY AFTER TEN YEARS OF CV RP WE HAVE DATA SUGGESTING THE MAJORITY OF REBATES. BEING ISSUED IN AREAS OF THE STATE OR SOME OF THE BEST AIR QUALITY. IS NOT THE WORST. IN ORDER TO FOCUS LIMITED RESOURCES TO AREAS OF THE STATE SUFFERING FROM THE WORST AIR QUALITY. AB ONE TWENTY SIX AIMS TO NARROW THE PROGRAM'S ELIGIBILITY WHILE BROADENING ITS REACH CURRENTLY THERE BE LIMITS ELIGIBILITY FOR HIGH INCOME EARNERS. THE CURRENT LIMITS ARE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SINGLE FILERS. TWO HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD FILERS. AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR JOINT FILERS.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS BILL MCCALLUM WITH KALISH FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT. THIS BILL IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT IS OUT OF MONEY. AS OF EARLY THIS MONTH IT WENT TO A WAITING LIST. AND I'M TOLD THAT SALES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THAT. AND THERE WILL OF COURSE BE MORE MONEY COMING WHEN THE NEW BUDGET GOES INTO EFFECT. BUT THAT MONEY WILL BE USED UP QUICKLY WILL NOT COME CLOSE. TO LASTING A YEAR ACCORDING TO A OUR PEACE PROJECTIONS. AND THOSE OF OTHER OBSERVERS. SO THIS BILL MAKES SOME OF THE SMART AND NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE REBATE PROJECT TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS. AND ALSO TO BE BOTH MORE EFFECTIVE. AND MORE EQUITABLE. THE INCOME CAPS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE. HAVE WORKED WELL. THE MINIMUM ELECTRIC RANGE HAS WORKED WELL THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE REBATES TO LAST AS LONG AS THEY HAVE. AND HAVE MADE THE PROGRAM MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EQUITABLE. NOW THAT WE'VE HAD THE THE SUCCESS WHICH IS GREAT THAT EVEY SALES ARE WAY UP. THAT ALSO MEANS THERE'S MORE STRESS ON A LIMITED BUDGET SO IT'S TIME TO MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS. TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EQUITABLE -- SOME OF THE AUTO COMPANIES WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IT A. R. B. IS THAT WHEN THE MONEY RUNS OUT IN A GIVEN YEAR. THE PROGRAM WE JUST GO DARK NO WAITING LIST IF YOU BY ANY VÌ AT THAT TIME APPLY FOR A REBATE. JUST NOTHING DOING YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO SUSTAIN A GROWING ELECTRIC THE ONLY VEHICLE MARKET. WE WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THE KIND OF ADJUSTMENTS THAT MISTER COOPER HAS IN HIS BILL. TO HELP THE PROGRAM TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS BE BOTH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EQUITABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR.

TO LOOK AT THAT REALLY SUMS UP WHAT THE ISSUE IS THAT SAID. WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL FOR SAY IN PRINT. FOR SEVERAL REASONS. ONE AT A TIME WHEN. ELECTRIC VEHICLE SALES ARE INCREASING BUT NOT NEARLY AT THE RATE THAT WE'RE DOING -- WHAT THOSE ENVISIONED WOULD LIKE TO DO IN CERTAIN THE GOVERNOR'S?

IT THE AMENDMENTS RIPOFF WHEN AN AND APPRECIATE BUT ONLY REALLY -- STILL A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT ON THE ROADS WE BELIEVE THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS THE PLACE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRAM -- THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THEY'RE THE EXPERTS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE HAVE HISTORIC. A CHALLENGES FOR WORKING WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND SO IT'S SOMETHING WHEN THE AUTOMAKERS THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AGREED.

WE WE IT MAKES THE PROGRAM MORE FLEXIBLE WHEN THEY ARE BE HAS THAT THAT -- THE CHANGES THEY CAN MAKE THAT TO EXTEND THE LIMITED FUNDS OF THINGS AS ARE ALL STATUTORY -- THAT'S A THAT'S A CHALLENGE -- AND I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT. THE REALITY THAT THIS IS THESE ARE STILL VERY EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILES WE ARE TRYING TO WE WILL SELL THEM TO ANYBODY THAT BUYS THEM BUT WE HAVE TO TO REALIZE THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THAT. IT IS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PURCHASE AND THE AMENDMENTS AGAIN ARE HELPFUL. BUT WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE THE A. R. B. CAN -- TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS AND SET UP THE PROGRAM WE THINK IT THEY'RE THEY'RE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE. AND WOULD ENCOURAGE -- THIS BILL NOT TO BE PASSED TODAY AND LET A OR B.

I DID WANT TO ASK YOU I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CLEAN CARS FOR ALL IN THIS ISSUE OF THIS ENERGY TRAP THAT AFFECTS LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ME PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE ON GAS AND ENERGY THAT ON THEIR HEALTHCARE AND FOOD IN SOME CASES RIGHT SO THIS IS EATEN INTO. MIDDLE CLASS BUDGET AND HOW TO BREAK THAT TRAVELING THIS IS PART OF IT -- DO YOU GUYS HAVE A SENSE HOW SOMEBODY'S EXISTING PROGRAMS WORKING IN MY APOLOGIES IF. THEY'RE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE THIS EM FIFTY F. M. P. WE'VE DONE THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL MAYBE SEVEN SPONSORS HAVE INSIGHT ON MAYBE YOU AS WELL LIKE. THAT SCHOOL I LOVE THE SCRAPPING REPLACE PROGRAM I THINK BIG OPPORTUNITIES THERE -- TO WE SEEN SINCE PROGRESS IN CENTRAL VALLEY I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED THE LA JUST. WE'RE NOT. INVESTED ENOUGH -- THOUGHTS ON ALL THAT I THINK THE BIG MY THOUGHTS ARE. THE BIGGEST THING IS. THERE IS WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY CENTRAL VALLEY AND FOR INSTANCE MR TITLES DISTRICT. SIX AND SIXTY FIVE REBATES COMPARED TO THE BAY AREA TWENTY THOUSAND NINE HERE NAY REBATES SO THE AREAS WITH THE WORST OR QUALITY. ARE GETTING WHAT YOU VEHICLES MISTRUSTING STATED THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND WITH A MEDIAN INCOME BEING. SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA MEANS HALF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA MAKES LESS THAN THAT. IT WILL NOT BE ABLE BY THESE CARS. AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT YEAH AND I'VE NEVER HEARD THE AUTOMAKERS TALK ABOUT CAR THEY'VE ALWAYS COMPLAINED ABOUT GUARDS TO CARBONI SO IT'S INTERESTING THE COMING TODAY IN. SUPPORT OF CAR FOR TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES THEIR MALES BUT I'M SURE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THESE THINGS. I'LL TAKE I'LL TAKE TALK IS WHEN THEY GO TO WASHINGTON I I THINK THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO THE LIKE. LET'S JUST STABILIZE SOMEHOW THE MARKET PLACE SO. I I LIKE THAT YOU'RE PUSHING IT DO YOU MISTER GARY I KNOW YOU AND I WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR A FEW YEARS. CAN WE CAN WE LINK WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE AUTHORS TIME OUT WITH SORT OF THE SCRAPPING PROGRAM IS IT IS -- WAYS TO PUMP ALL THAT UP AND GET PENETRATION INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY MARKETS ARE IN LOWER INCOME AREAS OF LA OR LONG BEACH YOUR THESE AREAS WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY DO WE HAVE A SHOT AT MAKING. MORE PROGRESS HERE YES I MEAN THAT'S DEFINITELY THE GOAL AND THE THE SCRAP REPLACE PROGRAM CLEAN CARS. WHICH YOU MISTER COOPER AND YOU HAVE BOTH BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN MOVING ALONG. HAS BEEN OFF TO AN EXCELLENT START IN BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SOUTH COAST AIR DISTRICT. IT'S NOW IN THE PROCESS OF STARTING UP IN THE BAY AREA AND BY NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE A PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO AIR DISTRICT SO I THINK WE NEED. MORE SUPPORT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS I THINK IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE. MORE FUNDING FOR THEM. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO HAVE THE THE REBATE PROJECT CVR P. TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS OR THERE'S JUST FRANKLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THROUGH THE YEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL REALLY SIX TO DO [INAUDIBLE] THIRTY DOLLARS. SO ARE ARE USED TO WORKING WITH AUTO -- MANUFACTURES ON THAT MILEAGE CAP YES. I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M PEOPLE THOSE ARE USED TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES AND IT'S IT'S DESK DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE THAT LOW BUT WITH THE LAST WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CHARGING AS WELL RIGHT. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. YEAH AND THAT'S I MEAN I THAT'S REALLY PART OF THE DISPARITIES THAT HE'S LOOKING AT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THE MORE URBAN AREAS TEND TO HAVE SHORT COMMUTES. SO EVEN IT WOULDN'T EVEN OTHER MAYBE LONGER TIME WISE. THIS ONE DRIVE A CAR PULLING YEAH WELL THAT'S THE CA YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH. WHEN IS A GOOD IDEA WITH IS THAT THEY USE BUY A CAR USE -- YOU TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE STICKERS. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET A LOT I GET A LOT OF THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT YOU'VE BEEN RAISED WE DON'T DO ANYTHING NEAR ENOUGH TO HELP. PROMOTE THAT PART OF THE MARKET THAT I THINK HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND AND A LOT OF BENEFITS -- SO. MINIMIZER I YES I I THINK TODAY I'M NOT COULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER I THINK YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE AUTO DEALERS ARE SIGNIFICANT WE PUT THEM IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POSITION THAT THEY HAVE.

IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THE HELP OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE HELP OF YOUR COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHER FOLKS ON A WIN THIS IS PART. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL DOT ON THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL. MRC IS SUPPORTIVE OF EIGHTY ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AS IT IS AND PRINT APPRECIATES THE HARD WORK THE AUTHORS STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE PUT INTO THIS BILL OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. MRC THE NONPROFIT FIVE OH ONE C. THREE AUTHORIZED BY CAL RECYCLE TO A MINISTER CAL RECYCLES MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM. AMBER SEA'S CREATED A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MATTRESS COLLECTION LOCATIONS TO SERVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS PROVIDING CONVENIENT MATTRESS RECYCLING ACCESS 290% OF CALIFORNIANS. THIS NETWORK IS AUGMENTED BY TARGETING COLLECTION EVENTS AND RETAILERS TAKING BACK OLD AT NO COST. IMMERSE IS EXCEEDED EACH OF CAL RECYCLES ANNUAL COLLECTION GOALS AND IS RECYCLED OVER FOUR MILLION MATTRESSES SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN OVER 80% OF MATTRESSES DISCARDED ANNUALLY OR DISCARDED FROM LANDFILL BECAUSE OF MRC SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THIS BILL REFLECTS THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESSES A STAKEHOLDER GOVERNANCE CONCERNS AND PROVIDES CAL RECYCLE WITH EXTENSIVE. NEW OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY. THIS BILL ALSO MANDATES THE SOLID WASTE FACILITIES COLLECTED OVER COLLECTING OVER ONE THOUSAND MATTRESSES AND REALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. A SUGGESTION MADE BY THE CAL RECYCLE MATTRESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THIS PROVISION SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S 75% DIVERSION GOAL. EVER SEE SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE USE AN EQUITABLE FORMULA FOR COMPENSATION. MANDATORY PARTICIPATION WILL INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS AND DECREASE ILLEGAL DUMPING. WITHOUT FULL FACILITY PARTICIPATION SOME CONSUMERS WILL BE CHARGED TWICE RECYCLING MATTRESSES. ONCE THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND AGAIN IF THE USE OF SAUDI THE CHARGES EXCESSIVE DISPOSAL FEES SOME CURRENTLY CHARGING UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. FOR A MATTRESS AND BOXSPRING. OVERALL MRC SUPPORTS THE BILL HOWEVER AND MARK SEE DOES DISAGREE WITH THE PROVISION PROHIBITING MRC FROM USING PROGRAM REVENUE LITIGATION INVOLVING THE STATE. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CARY CYCLE HAS NEVER SEE THE STATE AND DOESN'T ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR LITIGATION. BUT CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE CHANG'S. FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS FOR INSTANCE COULD TRIED TO DIVERT AMHERST HE'S REVENUE FOR OTHER PURPOSES IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT. WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNWISE TO PROHIBIT M. R. C. OR ITS SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION FROM DEFENDING THE PROGRAM'S LEGITIMATE AND LAWFUL INTERESTS. EVER SEE IS ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO STRIKE LIABILITIES FROM THE TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROVISION IS TO FACILITATE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION OF ALL OF THEM ARE SEIZE BUSINESS DEALINGS. BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED. LIABILITIES COULD INCLUDE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND HUNDREDS OF LONG TERM VENDOR CONTRACTS. WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE -- ON THIS MATTER IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. IN CONCLUSION -- AMMERSEE BELIEVES AB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN IMPLEMENTS BUT THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ADDRESSES STAKEHOLDER GOVERNANCE CONCERNS. YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU. THE WORK ON THE YES MARK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE WITH THIS PROGRAM AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENTS AN IMPROVEMENT. IN WHAT WAS THE A DECENTLY OPERATING PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM WE THINK THAT THAT THESE PROVISIONS WILL IMPROVE THAT PROGRAM MAKE IT BETTER -- THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED -- OF A VISION IN THE LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY WHAT WE WERE ANTICIPATING I THINK THE ANALYSIS IS CORRECT AND I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON THIS BALANCE. BETWEEN. PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECYCLING REFINANCING RECYCLING AT THE FRONT END. AND THAT CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY WHICH WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. AND THIS NOTION OF OF THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE CURSE THE BACKEND WE DON'T WANT CONSUMERS TO HAVE TO PAY TWICE -- BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM FINANCES ARE SUCH THAT THE THE SOLID WASTE SECTOR THE PROFESSIONAL RECYCLERS ARE ENTICED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND IF A WASTE HAULER IS CHARGING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A MATTRESS. IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE MATTRESSES THEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S THEY WERE THERE DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO DISCOURAGE IT SO WHAT WE WANT TO WORK. WITH WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT LANGUAGE TO KIND OF TO TO FINESSE THAT PROVISION. SO THAT CONSUMERS ARE CHARGED TWICE BUT THE EXISTING SOLID WAST INFRASTRUCTURE IS EAGER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM -- BUT WHEN I HAD THE BILL CONTINUE MOVING AND ARE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MARK THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY -- BUT THE FOLKS WHO WANT. TO THE FREE SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES. AND I'M HAPPY -- TO INDICATE THAT REPUBLIC SERVICES IS -- IN SUPPORT IF THE BILL AS AMENDED WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAFF AND WITH THE MEMBER -- AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. THE CONCERNS THAT RELATE TO THE MANDATORY PARTICIPATION PROVISIONS IN THE BILL -- IN WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD PROVIDE -- A MONOPOLY IF YOU WOULD AND WOULD PRECLUDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NEGOTIATE A A CORRECT OR MARKET PRICE WITH THE MRC WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION OF BEING FORCED TO DO THE WORK AND NOT GETTING ADEQUATELY. COMPENSATED THE ALTERNATIVE MIGHT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS THAT -- VENDORS OUR SOLD LISA SO THESE WOULD NOT BE TAKING THESE THESE -- MATTRESSES AT ALL AND THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT A BANKER AND PASS IT OUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] MR. BUT A SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] YES SIR. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF WASTE MANAGEMENT JUST ONE LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE MADE BY MISTER. THANK YOU. CITY SANTA MONICA. COME ON I WANT HERE WITH CITIES AND MUCH OF IT. OKAY ALL RIGHT YOU'RE TWEENER LET'S HEAR FROM YOU. SO I'M WITH A NATIONAL PRIVILEGE DOES YOUR ON BEHALF NATIONAL ACTION COUNCIL HEALTHCARE PART SEARCH COUNCIL AND STOP -- WE ARE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL HER WORK WE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. I WON THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN PRIOR TO THAT -- SO WE WANT TO MOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO TO A SUPPORT IF AMENDED THERE ARE STILL FEW. KEY OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT MARK HAS OUTLINED ABOUT THE BIGGER IT'S NOT MANDATED AND MAYBE WRITE SOME INCENTIVES. AS WELL AS INSURANCE REPORTS AND STUDIES DEVELOP BY WITH CONSUMER FEE MONEY OUR PUBLIC WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND PRIORITIZING CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FAMILY TO BE SPENT ON CONTRACTING WITH CALIFORNIA PROCESSING FACILITIES. ARE WILL CONTINUE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WE THINK THE OFFICE OFFICE AND THE THE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORKING COMMITTEE -- BUT WE'RE REMOVING OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU FIGURE MUCH OKAY -- OPPOSITION. CONCERNS ANYONE WANT TO RAISE OKAY. I'M SEEING THEN THE MATTER IS BROUGHT BACK MANY QUESTIONS THOUGHTS -- SENATE ALI. THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR WORKING WITH US RULE LEGISLATORS TO HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT. TIME IN A OF TRANSPORTATION THEY'RE THEY'RE OFF AWFULLY LARGE AND THEN THE COST THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THAT AS WELL -- WIND UP SEEING THEM ALONGSIDE THE ROAD ON THE FOREST AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR KNOWING ARTISTRY CAN COME ALONG SIDE THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS AS MR BIGELOW NIGHT SO -- LOOK FOR THIS BILL GETTING SIGNED IN LAWN AND DO SOME GOOD WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER AT MINISTER. I JUST A QUESTION REGARDING THE THE THE LITIGATION FEE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED REMOVING THAT PROVISION FROM. AS PART OF THE AMENDMENT AS IT GOES FORWARD YEAH THAT SEEMS TO BE A REAL. AREA OF CONCERN. ON THE PART OF MRC. YES CORRECT -- WE'VE OF SERVE TO OTHER PROGRAMS -- ISSUES AND ABUSES WITH. A WITH THE SEIZE OF LITIGATION ALONG THE WAY WE THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF OF THIS FINE WHEN I WAS CREATED WEST TO HELP. RECYCLE MATTRESSES. ON IN COMBAT ILLEGAL DUMPING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS BEING USED FOR THAT ENOUGH FOR OTHER ITEMS -- ALONG THE WAY. I THINK THE SUGGESTION IS THAT IT MAYBE PIECE OF FIFTY TWO SPECIFIC A LITIGATION SO IF YOU CONSIDER THAT GOING FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR SO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. SOME REMEMBER WE HAD ON AND AND INVENTION MY DISTRICT AND IT WAS VERY POPULAR. WE HAVE A LOT OF MATTRESSES TURNED IN BY MRC SO I AM GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY BUT JUST WITH A A LITTLE URGING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN BE NARROWED. SO THAT IT'S ACCEPTABLE AND THEN WE GET EVERYBODY ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A GOOD PROGRAM. WE WE ARE GREAT THINK ALL OF US IN THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WAY EVERYONE AT THE TABLE IS THAT WE HAVE. A PROGRAM AND WE HAVE THE RARE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER. ON A AND SEND THAT TO US WE ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE ESTAS CONTINUES WE GET CLOSER TO A FULL CONSENSUS. ALONG THE WAY AND SO ON JUST LIKE THE LAST BILL WE CONCERT TRYING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO MAKE US ALL. HAPPY ENOUGH RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE ALONG THE WAY BUT HAPPY ENOUGH AND SO WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE MRC -- AND ALL THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE WITH US. HELLO CONSIDER. THANK YOU OKAY -- IN THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE I DO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND AND OBVIOUSLY. HAS BEEN A LOT OF BACK CHANNELING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT -- STAKEHOLDER SO I KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE GOT INVOLVED SO -- I'M STRONGLY RECOMMENDING IT. AND I VOTE. YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT OUR COMMITMENTS AND AND IF IT PASSES OUT -- GO TO SEND A PREPARATION SO -- IF THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE THE BILL. ARE YOU DID OKAY SO THANK YOU SO THAT'S WHAT YOU DID THE VERY BEGINNING SO THIS MOVE BY CENTER DOLLY APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR -- SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLEN HI ALLEN I BATES. RIGHT BATES HI HILL. SKINNER [INAUDIBLE] STERN. DOLLY. DALI AYE WIECKOWSKI. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT WILL HOLD THAT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO AND ON AND NOW -- YOU'LL PRESENT YOUR FINAL BILL THE DAILIES THIS MORNING -- THIS IS ITEM THIRTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY SIX AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. THANK YOU SO THE FIRST TWO BILLS FOR ABOUT IMPROVING NO WORK WE'VE ALREADY DONE -- AND THIS BILL IS ME VENTURING UNTIL A WHOLE NEW SPACE I AND P. FOSS -- WHICH IS A CHEMICAL -- THAT I LEARNED ABOUT US I WAS READING ABOUT EXCITED WHICH LED ME TO FLINT WHICH LED ME TO VERMONT AND MINNESOTA -- AND LET ME TO P. FIVE I AND AND I WANTED TO THE HISTORY OF YOUR BOOKING RESCUE ARE YOU WORKING ON THIS AND WHEN I STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE US AND THE DANGERS BEHIND IT AND I SAY TO LOOK AT MAPS. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE MAP OF? OF WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED WHEN I LOOKED AT LA COUNTY. ALL OF THE TECH ALL OF THE SITES ALL THE WEALTH WITH P. FOSS FOR CONCENTRATED IN MY DISTRICT. AND VALLEY COUNTY ONLY IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A FEELING THAT'S PROBABLY NOT TRUE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TESTED X. EXPENSIVELY. BUT IT DID RECENT ALARMING KIND OF PUSH TO THE FOREFRONT THAT CONTINUE DISCUSSION OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TREATED LIKE WASTE LANCE AND LEAD CHROMIUM SIX ARSENIC -- AND NOW PEOPLE US AMONG OTHER CHEMICALS OUT THERE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND SO -- WITH THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TAKING THE SPACE THAT WERE OUT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND WE'RE AT LEAST GETTING INFORMATION ONLINE CONSUMERS TO MAKE. RIGHT CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES -- I THINK I AM TAKING AMENDMENTS HERE BUT OTHER EXCEPT YES I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THAT -- TO BE CLEAR IT THIS BILL DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THE TESTING AS THE WATER BOARD ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. TO DO THAT. AND THERE THE FEDERAL UNREGULATED CONTAMINANT MONITORING ROLE WE GATHER SOME INITIAL INFORMATION ABOUT P. FLOOD CONTAMINATION. THAT INFORMATION IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. UNDER THE SAME WILL CALIFORNIA HAS MORE CONTAMINATION DETECTIONS THAN ANY OTHER STATE THIS FAMILY A CHEMICAL HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS. CALIFORNIA QUITE FRANKLY HAS FALLEN BEHIND WAITING FOR CONGRESS OR THE EPA TO SAY WITH THIS WISHFUL THINKING. AS WE SEE THAT THEY'RE OFF THE ROLLING BACK -- WORK MUCH HONESTLY MOVING FORWARD. WHILE THE INITIAL VERSIONS IS BILL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ALL WATER SYSTEM TO TEST THE TECH TO WILL . FIVE THE BILL IN PENN SIMPLY BOTH THERE'S A WATER WORTH INVESTIGATIVE TESTING. TO GET A HANDLE LOW WHERE THESE FOREVER CHEMICALS ARE. THE WATER PERSONALLY EMBARKING ON A FACE INVESTIGATIVE TESTING OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUSPECTED TO HAVE CONTAMINATION. ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY I HAVE JEAN WILLIAMS AND ANDREA EVANS HER TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF. DURING THE UNREGULATED CONTAMINANT MONITORING ROLE FIFTEEN WELLS WERE ACTUALLY FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH THESE CHEMICALS IN CALIFORNIA WERE SHUT DOWN BUT THERE WERE YOU. NOTIFICATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DRINKING THAT WATER. AND IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED HOW. TOXIC THIS CONTAMINANT IS IT TOO CAN TO PCB BUT PC BEES DON'T USUALLY GET INTO DRINKING WATER. THESE CHEMICALS DO THEY'RE EXTREMELY SOLUBLE -- WHEN I TESTIFIED RECENTLY IT'S? POLLS FOUND IN DRINKING WATER BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PROBLEM TO FIX. AND IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE IN CRISTINA GARCIA IS DISTRICT IT'S GOING TO BE IN DISTRICTS LIKE YOURS TO SENATOR DOLLING. WHEREVER THEIR MILITARY BASES WERE GONNA FIND THAT THESE CHEMICALS HAVE CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER. SO -- THIS BILL WOULD -- NOTIFY PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DRINKING CONTAMINATED WATER -- THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION THEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY SHOULD FIND NEW SOURCES OF WATER AND RIGHT NOW JUST IN PHASE ONE OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY WELLS. THERE IS NO COUNTY THAT IS UNAFFECTED BY THE SOURCE WELLS. FROM AND THERE'S TWO HUNDRED NINE WATER SYSTEMS THAT'S JUST DAYS ONE OF THE THREE PHASE PROGRAM TO LOOK EXTENSIVELY FOR THESE CHEMICALS. IN OUR DRINKING WATER WELLS AND AT AT SOURCES WHICH ARE LANDFILLS AIRPORTS REFINERIES CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CHROME PLATING. SO I READ YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M SURE I WILL BE IN FOR THIS COMMITTEE AGAIN ON THESE CHEMICALS THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY TOXIC AND VERY PERVASIVE NOW IN OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS THANK YOU. JUST THE OPPOSITE. HI I'M ANDREA EVAN TURNER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I WANT. TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THIS BILL AS A STEP IN MOVING FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEARD CALIFORNIA BASED ON LIMITED DATA. OF ACTUALLY HAS THE MOST TO TECH KNOWN DETECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND YET WE ARE FAR BEHIND OTHER STATES THAT ARE MOVING TO GET A BETTER GRIP ON WHAT THIS CONTAMINATION MEANS SO. MIGHT MY HOPE TO BE HERE TODAY IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BECAUSE AS AWARENESS HAS BEEN GROWING. ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND OUR STATE ABOUT THESE FOREVER CHEMICALS THEY DO NOT BREAK DWN THEY ARE GOING TO BE WITH US. PRETTY MUCH FOREVER -- I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE A FEW BACKGROUND POINTS ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE. FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A CLASS OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS. ARE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. WITH THE VAST METADATA IS CHIU CHEMICALS AND BEEN USED FOR DECADES BUT THE GROWING NUMBER OF THESE NEWER GENERATION CHEMICALS ARE AS PERVASIVE AND AS PERMANENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND DESPITE SOME CLAIMS FROM THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TAT THESE NEWER VERSIONS ARE SAFER WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED. AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEIR OLDER COUSINS BUT THE EMERGING SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO CALLING THE ALARM ON THIS. IS THAT THEY ARE STRUCTURALLY THE SAME AND ARE EXTREMELY TOXIC SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AS OUR FIRST STEP IS TO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW MUCH OF THIS STUFF IS OUT THERE AND REALLY WHAT IT IS WHICH CHEMICALS ARE OUT THERE. AND THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION -- I DID WANT TO JUST MAKE TWO FINAL POINTS ON THIS YOU MAY HEAR THAT AS THE YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A PLAN THAT WILL DEAL WITH CHIU CHEMICALS AT A FIVE THOUSAND AND THERE ARE NO DEADLINES THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT I STATES LIKE NEW YORK VERMONT. MINNESOTA ARE MOVING AHEAD ALREADY STUDYING WITH THEIR PROBLEMS ARE IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THEM. THE SAME THING IS HERE -- THE STATE IS NOT YET WORKING ON A REGULATION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET WE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW BROAD THIS PROBLEM IS AS YOU JUST HEARD IT'S GOING TO BE VERY BROAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB THEY'VE GOT IT GOOD SITE INVESTIGATION STARTED THIS YEAR. THIS BY A BILL BOTH BOLSTERS THAT. FINALLY TRANSPARENCY IS ESSENTIAL. OUR PEOPLE HAVE THE BASIC RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S IN THEIR WATER SO IF -- WE ARE MONITORING THEIR SYSTEMS THEY SHOULD BE TOLD WHETHER THESE CHEMICALS ARE THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE. THAT NOT ONLY IS HUMAN RIGHTS BUT IT ALSO BILLS ACTUALLY MORE TRUST IN WATER -- PUBLIC WATER PURVEYORS MANY OF WHOM ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN TO ADDRESS THESE KIND OF MERCHANTS. EXCUSE ME CONTAMINANTS SO WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL AND OUR MEMBERS CALL FOR THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER FOLKS WHO WANT -- TO REYES SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. FILL OUT ANY OF OUR DELYLAH ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- AS MISS VENTURE POINTS OUT THESE NEWER CHEMICALS ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS A NEW REPORT JUST CAME OUT OF FAST CHEMICALS AND PANCREATIC CANCER IN RODENTS. SO AS THE SCIENCE EMERGES WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE USE OF THESE CHEMICALS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THREE SEPARATE VERGE ON BEHALF OF THE DIMINISH THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT. NEGO CHAPMAN ON BEHALF OF ME WATER CENTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY HI FOLKS HONOREES CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OPPOSITION. WE CAN MAKE SOME SPACE FOR THEM. DRAW IT OFF AGO JUST. I CAN ALWAYS CONSENSUS I TRY. THE TO HAVE SOME OF THE COOLEST GLASSES IN THE BUILDING AS FROM A SALAD THAT YEAH IT'S A GOOD INTRODUCTION SO HE'S GOT SOMETHING IN COMMON YEAH THAT'S FINE. WELL A LOT IN COMMON YEAH. GOOD MORNING SENATORS AND CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENTS HERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB SEVEN FIVE SIX WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- FOR HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH US AND AND BEING OPEN -- TO SERVE OUR FEEDBACK. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR CONCERNS. DURING FOR P. FAST. THIS IS A AS AS WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS IS A CHEMICAL FOR ART FOREVER CHEMICAL VERY PREVALENT. IN WATER SYSTEMS IN FOOD IT'S IT'S ME IN MANY PLACES. I APPRECIATE THE COST WAS BROUGHT UP -- WATER AGENCIES DID NOT CREATE THIS PROBLEM BUT WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ADDRESSING IT AND THERE IS. SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO THAT. WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO PUBLIC NOTIFICATION PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORTS AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS. THEY DO MAKE THE BILL -- MUCH BETTER WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO FIXING AN ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE INTENT OF SUBSECTION A OF THE BILL -- REGARDING THE WATER BOARD AND THEIR STORY TO ISSUE ORDERS TO MULTIPLE AGENCIES. WE WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THAT I THINK THE LANGUAGE THAT HIS IMPRINT IS MUCH MORE BROAD THAN THAT GIVES THE BOARD A LOT MORE AUTHORITY -- IN THAT REGARD. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE BOARD. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE BOARD BEFORE THE ISSUE AN ORDER HAS TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. OF A OF A WELL OR WATER SOURCE UNDER THE LANGUAGE CRAFTED IN THE BILL THAT -- REQUIREMENT IS NOT THERE SO THE WATER BOARD CAN SIMPLY REQUIRE EVERY WATER AGENCY TO MONITOR FOR P. FAST WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME. OF BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S CONTAMINATION. WE HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD RESOLVE THAT ISSUE AND WOOD -- REALLY FOCUS ON AMENDING EXISTING LAW. WE ALSO DON'T THINK THAT -- IT WOULD IT'S BENEFICIAL TO HAVE WATER AGENCIES REPORT ON WELLS -- FOUR OF FIVE YEARS EVEN AFTER THOSE WELLS OR WATER SOURCES HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND ADDRESSED -- THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CONTINUOUS -- REPORTING FOR FIVE YEARS -- IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORTS -- OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS REALLY THE SEPARATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND NOTIFICATION PROCESS THAT'S BEING CREATED SPECIFIC TO P. F. A. S.. CHEMICALS -- AS AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT -- WORK GOING ON ALREADY REGARDING P. FAST AND CHEMICALS AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL USEPA IS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A DISH AND THE SHOULDER OF DETERMINATION ON TO CHEMICALS AS WAS STATED EARLIER -- WHO THEY BELIEVE TO USEPA SAYS THEY WILL HAVE THIS DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR? THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN BILLS MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS RELATED TO P. FAST THAT WOULD EITHER EXPEDITE AND MCL. OR REQUIRE OTHER ADDITIONAL REGULATION -- A NUMBER OF THESE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT -- AND SOMETHING MAY ACTUALLY HAPPEN ON P. FAST REGULATION IN CONGRESS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY -- IT SOUNDS CRAZY TO SAY -- BUT IN MARCH UNDER EXISTING WATER BOARD AUTHORITY -- THEY INITIATED THIS PHASED INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF A P. FAST CONTAMINATION IT AND THEY ORDERED. AS WAS SAID EARLIER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY WELLS AND TWO HUNDRED NINE WATER SYSTEMS -- TO TO TEST FOR A P. FPS CHEMICALS WE WILL BE TESTING OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND NUMBER OF THOSE ARE WITH. AQUA MEMBER AGENCIES. WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND -- HOW HOW MANY WELLS AND SYSTEMS ARE IMPACTED -- SO THEY WILL BE TESTING OVER THE NEXT YEAR IF THEY EXCEED NOTIFICATION LEVELS THEY WILL REPORT THAT TO THEIR GOVERNING BODIES -- THEY WILL -- THESE WILL GO INTO THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORT AS WELL -- AND SO WE AGREE -- AGAIN WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT THAT SAYS THAT IF A RESPONSE LEVEL IS EXCEEDED THAT SHOULD ALSO GO INTO THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORT THAT MAKES SENSE. BUT AGAIN A SEPARATE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR P. FASS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT WE WOULD ASK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SAYS IF. PROCESS IS NOT WORKING -- IF IT'S NOT WORKING FOR P. FAST IF IT'S NOT WORKING FOR OTHER CONTAMINANTS LET'S CHANGE EXISTING LAWS SO THAT IT DOES WORK. THAT'S NOT CREATE A SEPARATE REGULATORY STRUCTURE FOR ONE GROUP OF CONTAMINANTS -- FINALLY JUST A REALLY QUICK ASSEMBLY A BILL EIGHT FOUR ONE BY -- MR TANG -- THOUGH WE KNOW THAT BILL IS NOT MOVING THAT THE BILL WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT SET TIMELINES FOR STATE AGENCIES TO COMPLETE SOME WORK REGARDED. REGARDING P. FAST WE SUPPORT THAT EFFORT THEEXISTING PROCESS IS VERY SCIENTIFIC VERY TECHNICAL. WE THINK THAT REGULATING CONTAMINANTS LENDS ITSELF TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS BETTER THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHASING AND SOLVE THIS REPRESENTING THE ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT WE TO SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS MOST NOTABLY THE SEPARATE P. FAST REGULATORY STRUCTURE. BUT THAT SAID WE ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THE WATER DISTRICT WILL BE RE EVALUATING. THE POSITION BUT WOULD HOPE TO HAVE THE SEPARATE REGULATORY PROCESS ADDRESSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER FOLKS WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS. I'M DANIEL BLASTED OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE WE ARE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE JUST MATT AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE OUR AND CONCERNS BUT WE DO SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT THAT AWKWARD HAS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH -- THE AUTHOR IN THIS COMMITTEE TRYING TO DRESS. THE SECURE MEMBERS THE THIRTY MILLION ON HAND HALF OF THE SENATE CLEARED OF OUR WATER AGENCY IN MAY SO WATER DISTRICT WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS AQUA. THANK YOU. RYAN IS JACKING WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY -- HAVE IDENTICAL CONCERNS SAGA DO SUPPORT -- ADDRESSING P. FAST WOULD LIKE TO JUST THE INCORPORATED UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT WILL CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK -- AND REEVALUATE BASED ON THAT. THANK. OKAY. YEAH I MEAN IT I MEAN -- THE END OF THE DAY. THE BILL SCALED BEEN SCALED BACK FROM ACQUIRING THE WATER SYSTEMS A TEST REVIEW THIS DOWN. TO YOU KNOW AUTHORIZING THE BOARD OR MONITORING I UNDERSTAND YOU YOU YOU MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT BUT YOU'LL STILL BE AN AGENT WITH THE BOARD OVER. THE VALUE IN THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF SEAT WITH DOING THAT AYE AYES TO YOU KNOW THE BOARD IS AN INTERESTING POINT AND WATER AGENCIES OUT OF BUSINESS BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE HIGH. WATER QUALITY THAT RECEIPT THAT -- THESE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS ARE OF YOUR MAKING BY YOU CAN RESPONSIBILITIES OF I'D CLEAN WATER. TO FOLKS -- SO I'M I'M. I HEAR YOU I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET BUT I I I'M FEELING. COMFORTABLE SUPPORT THE BILL THE DAIS. AS AMENDED -- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. THE BILL OKAY -- OKAY ANY OTHER DISCUSSION NOW ALRIGHT I HAVE YOU MAY CLOSE. OUT YES THEY DO ON A RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK YOU'D BE HERE FROM THEM THERE IS. A LOT OF COMMON GROUND -- I DON'T AGREE THAT WE ARE REALLY CREATING A SEPARATE REGULATORY PROCESSES WERE ST. TO THE WATER BOARD IS ALREADY LOOKING AT AT LEAST TWO OF THESE CHEMICALS -- AS WE KNOW MOST ABOUT TO TREAT HIM LIKE A FAMILY THERE ARE FOREVER CHEMICALS WE KNOW THEY BEHAVE VERY SIMILARLY -- AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN THROUGH. FIVE THOUSAND OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES WE COULD. HAVE WON THAT THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING OUR NOT INTERFERE IN THE AND THAT PROCESS AT ALL WHATSOEVER CRIME FAMILY. YES AT YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S MAYBE WORTH IN A CRIME FAMILY -- FROM FROM THE EFFECTS OUT THERE -- YOU KNOW AND I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THEY SUPPORT MR TING THIS BILL THAT IS SPECIFIC TO P. PHOSPHO IF THE SEPARATE REGULATION WAS TRUE ARGUMENT. THAT'S ALSO CREATING A SEPARATE ELATION THERE ON P. -- FIVE AND SO I I FIND THAT TO BE AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT THERE I WOULD SAY THAT. ANY PROCESS WE HAVE CAN ALWAYS BE IMPROVED AND SAVE THE M. CELL PROCESS THESE TO BE INPUT AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT COULD BE HAD. SEPARATELY I IN THE FUTURE SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED TO I WANT TO MAKE SET UP PROCESS IS WORKING. PROPERLY I LOOK AT OUR PROCESS WITH CHROMIUM SIX AND THAT'S TAKEN OVER A DECADE AND SO THERE'S DEFINITELY IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE HAD. I THINK WITH THIS BILL MY GOAL IS TWO THINGS ONE TO RAISE AWARENESS WITH THE PUBLIC OF WHAT P. FIVE IS. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE JUST TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT THIS -- INTO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IF YOU ARE PREGNANT THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU DO NOT DRINK THIS WATER IF YOU DO NOT KNOW. THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION -- I THINK THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF NEEDING TO MAKE DECISIONS IF YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE AT A TRESTLE THAT SHOULD BE THIS CLOSE TO THE GOVERNING. BODY WHY SHOULD WE NOT DISCLOSE IT TO THE CONSUMER AS WELL IN A PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY BEING USES CLOSE. A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TO THE CONSUMERS OUT THERE THIS CONSUMERS THAT WANT IT WILL USE THAT INFORMATION AND THOSE THAT DON'T. WILL DISCARD THE LETTER LIKE THEY DO EVERY YEAR -- WITH THEIR BILL OUT THERE THIS IS A SMALL BILL IF HE ASKED ME FOR A REALLY LARGE AND SCARY PROBLEM OUT THERE. I RECOMMEND YOU ALL LOOK AT THE DEVIL WE DON'T KNOW ON WILL BE ON NETFLIX A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THIS. THIS PROBLEM IS BAD ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE -- RANCHERS IN THE STATE OF OUR CENTER LAB TO KILL THOUSANDS OF CAL'S BECAUSE IT IS A FOREVER CHEMICAL IN IT IF IT'S IN YOUR WATER AND THEN LISTEN TO YOUR FOOD SOURCE IN A STAYS THERE. IT'S POPPING UP AND THINGS LIKE -- CAKE -- THIS CAKE BAKING BOXES OUT THERE -- IT'S IT'S POPPING UP NOT TO THEIR PLACES IN A WHILE ONE SMALL AMOUNT OF IN A BOX MAY SEEM LIKE NOT A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IT THE FOREVER CHEMICAL THAT SISTER IT ACCUMULATES. INSIDE THE COMPOUND IT ISSUE THAT WERE BEING FACED WITH IT'S IT'S PRETTY GREAT OUT THERE AND SO. WE KNOW. I WOULD SAY THAT AQUA AND THESE OTHER WATER AGENCIES MIGHT HAVE CONCERNS THAT ARE FOR A FIRST LOOK AT THE P. FOSSE'S DANGEROUS ENOUGH. WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS FAMILY EVEN THOUGH MORE AND MORE THE SCIENCES EMERGING. THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING ACTION I ALWAYS SAY IT'S CRIMINAL FOR US TO SIT HERE AND SAY LET'S WAIT THIS WE KNOW THE TEN YEARS TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE I LISTEN TO ME TO PUT COMMUNITIES IN DANGER. ON COMPETING AND CONTINUE TO PUT KIDS WHO ARE DEVELOPING IN DANGER WHILE WE FIGURE OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I FIND THAT TO BE A CRIMINAL STAND SINCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I I DO HOPE I SCARE SOME OF THE TO GO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SAME MAKING BETTER CHOICES FOR YOURSELF. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I'M. AS OUR CLOTHES I WE WE BUT WE CERTAINLY. HAVE A YEAR. IF YOU WANT YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AFTERWARDS WE HAVE TO HAVE IT HAPPEN HERE FROM YOU IN AND CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU. I'M OKAY WITH THAT AS ADAM TO MOVE BY CINEMA CASKEY -- SURGICALLY KALRA. ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AB. SEVEN FIFTY SIX THE MOTION AS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES HILL [INAUDIBLE] SKINNER. STERN. DOLLY. I BY CASKEY. ESKI AYE OKAY THANK YOU FOR USING AMBER AND YVETTE EVERYONE FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. IT LOOKS LIKE A OBSERVERS COLORANTS AROUND AS A BEEN USING INTENSE DISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATION OF WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FORBEARANCE SOONER CERVANTES SO LET'S NOW HEAR FROM -- COLORADO'S HERE TO PRESENT IN TENNIS AB SIX FORTY SEVEN ACT REALLY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. MAYBE SEE ONE RIGHT THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE OPTION PRESENT AB SIX FORTY SEVEN BEFORE YOU TODAY. I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT JUST OUTLINED THE ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE THE TIME GIVEN TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AT ADDRESSING CONCERNS EXPRESSED. SB SIX FORTY SEVEN REQUIRED COSMETIC AND DISINFECTING MANUFACTURES WERE ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. TO POSE A SAFETY DATA SHEETS ONLINE AND TRANSLATE INTO COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY SOMEONE SPECIALS. CITY DATA SHEETS ARE USES A SOURCE INFORMATION ABOUT HAZARDS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND TO OBTAIN ADVICE ON SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. SALON PROFESSIONALS MANY OF WHOM ARE IMMIGRANTS WOMEN OF COLOR AND HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SKILLS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING A MULTITUDE OF CHEMICALS KNOWN. OR SUSPECTED TO POSE A HEALTH RISK CAUSE HARM. BY ALLOWING SAFETY DATA SHEETS TO BE ACCESSIBLE ONLINE AND TRANSIT IN OTHER LANGUAGES INCREASES TRANSPARENCIES RAISES SAFETY AWARENESS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR SOME PROFESSIONALS. AS THE BILL MOVES FOR UP TO TWO TO TRY TO FOR THE CURRENT BY THE BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INTERESTED PARTIES. WITH ME TODAY PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY I CATHERINE PORTER CALL CALIFORNIA HEALTHY MEALS LONG COLLABORATIVE AND IN A TRÊN NAIL SALON COMMUNITY MEMBER. OKAY YES MA'AM HI I'M CATHERINE PORTER -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THE A POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HELPING ELSE ONE COLLABORATIVE. WE ARE ONE OF THE TWO ORGANIZATIONAL CO SPONSORS ALONG WITH WORK SAFE -- AND ON WHOSE BEHALF I WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING TODAY. CALIFORNIA NAY ALLEN HERE SALON WORKERS MANY OF WHOM ARE OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. SINCE IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS CONTAINING CARCINOGENS IN CHEMICALS LINKED. TO REPRODUCTIVE RESPIRATORY ANOTHER HARM MANY SALON PROFESSIONALS ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. UNDER EXISTING LABOR LAW MANUFACTURERS MUST DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE HARD COPY SAFETY DATA SHEETS FOR PRODUCTS CONTAINING HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN THEIR ULTIMATELY REQUIRED TO BE AVAILABLE. OUT TO OUR WORKPLACES BY EMPLOYERS BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE HARD COPY DOCUMENTS CAN THAT GET LOST IN THE CHAIN OF DISTRIBUTION. SALON OWNERS -- SAY THAT THEY'RE OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE AT BEAUTY SUPPLY STORES -- ADVOCATES LIKE OUR ORGANIZATIONS. AND COUNTY NC COORDINATORS WOOKIE LOCAL HEALTHY NAIL SALON RECOGNITION PROGRAMS HAVE A HARD TIME OBTAINING SAFETY DATA SHEETS TO ASSIST OUR NAIL SALONS TO BECOME HEALTHIER WORKPLACES -- OFTEN BECAUSE LICENSE NUMBERS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE OBTAINING SAFETY DATA SHEETS ONLINE -- IS SO THIS IS A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD BILL -- REQUIRES SAFETY DATA SHEETS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO BE CREATED TO BE POSTED ON THE MANUFACTURER'S WEBSITE. AND THOSE ARE ONLINE VERSIONS -- MUST BE TRANSLATED INTO -- SPANISH VIETNAMESE CHINESE AND KOREAN WE THINK THIS IS A MODEST AND REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO SHINE MORE LIGHT ON THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COSMETICS AND DISINFECTANTS USED EVERY DAY BY WOMEN SALON WORKERS. HAVE FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE A YES VOTE ON A. B.. SIX FOUR SEVEN THANK YOU SORRY. HI GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS THE ENTRANCE AND MY PARTNERS AND I OWN A COPY -- EAGLE ELSE ON HERE IN POLLS IN CALIFORNIA. ON MY MOTHER'S BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I JUST KIND OF LIKE HIGHLIGHTED. DETAILS WHEN I WAS AND YOU KNOW QUITE HIGH SCHOOL. COLLEGE AND I NEVER [INAUDIBLE] HI -- EITHER I NOR MY MOM OR THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE'RE JUST LIKE EVERYONE IS USING IT AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE SELLING IT TO LESSEN MUST BE SAFE. RIGHT -- BUT AFTER YEARS -- WE HAVE. A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE BUSINESS AND TO YOU KNOW HOW THIS LANGUAGE BARRIER WITH A TO UNDERSTAND -- BY THESE CHEMICALS ARE TOXIC AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I KNOWS OF THE SAFETY DATA SHEETS IS BECAUSE I LEARNED IT FROM A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY THAT I WASN'T. SO WHEN I OPEN SALON I MADE SURE WE HAD TO LOSE DATA SHEETS BUT YOU KNOW THERE AN ENGLISH AND FOR ME IT'S HARD -- TO TRANSLATE INTO YOU NEEDS TO LET MY EMPLOYEES KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS. ARE IN THERE [INAUDIBLE] ON AND I THINK FOR ME X. -- IF THEY'RE ROUGHLY AVAILABLE ONLINE IT'S EASIER TO ACCESS. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND OTHER LANGUAGES -- SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT NOT ONLY. FOR EMPLOYEES THE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE -- SO I YOU KNOW AS ANY ALSO HONOR I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS I'M EXPOSING YOU KNOW MY MY WORKERS TO ENTER CLIENTS THAT WERE SERVING. SO ON IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW WE KNOW KIND OF LIKE. WHAT CHEMICAL THREE HUNDRED PERSON WAS EXPOSED TO AND IN MAY SAVE HIS OR HER LIFE? SO -- PLEASE HELP US PROVIDE A SAFER MORE TRANSPARENT WORK SPACE -- ALL THIS IN THE MAIL INDUSTRY IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. SO I REGION PLEASE -- YES ON EIGHTY SIX FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OTHER FOLKS WANT TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THE BILL OUT LEÓN BERMAN A WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THERESA BREAKAGE ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS ADVANCINGJUSTICE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND ALSO SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN SUPPORT. OKAY -- SIX HONOREES CONCERNS WITH THE OPPOSITION [INAUDIBLE] YOU COMPARE. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT. THE AUTHOR DR TODAY IN CLARIFYING THAT UNIVERSE OF PRODUCTS THAT THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT WE DO APPRECIATE THAT AMENDMENT AND WE'VE BEEN -- THAT ISONE OF OUR REQUEST FOR AMENDMENTS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. AND I THINK THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE REFINED IN THE BILL AND THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT TOOK TO OUR MEMBERS READ. AS THOUGH THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO CREATE AND TRANSLATE AND POST. A DIFFERENT MSTS FOR EVERY SHADE OR TENT -- I THINK THT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WE AUTHORS OFFICE IT IS AT IT HE'S MADE CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL HE ONLY WANTS US TO CREATE -- AND TRANSLATE IMPOSED A MSTS IF ONE EXISTS FOR DIFFERENT COLOR AND TEN WE'VE DISCUSSES IN THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH HIM TO REFINE.

CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY ALIGNED WITH THE INDUSTRIES. EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO IS ALSO -- WHO SUPPORTED BY NUMBER OF CLEAN OCEAN ORGANIZATIONS A SUPPORT ALL EFFORTS TO REDUCE PLASTIC POLLUTION LIKE THIS BILL HELPS TO DO? WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT EACH ROOM CAN GENERATE UP TO A THOUSAND TINY BOTTLES PER YEAR? THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE ESTA LANDFILLS WE ARE MOVING A SIGNIFICANT -- IN CALIFORNIA LOMA TALK ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BOTTLES EVERY YEAR -- AND IT'S NOT FEASIBLE FOR THESE PLUS BOTTLES TO BE MANAGEMENT CYCLE BECAUSE OUR SMALL SIZE AND THE RESIDUAL PRODUCT LEFT IN THE BOTTLES. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS ON CALDWELL ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION RESPECT US RIGHT JOHN TIME. I KNOW CHAIR FOR AWHILE OKAY. MADAM CHAIR.

TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HI IT HAS COMMITTED TO DIVERTING 40% OF ITS WASTE FROM LANDFILLS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND AS YOU'RE NOT ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. MARRIOTT ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INSTALL FULL DISPENSERS IN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PROPERTIES INCLUDING HIGH AND FACILITIES LIKE REST OF RITZ CARLTON -- YEAH AND MERRY OUTS NOT ALONE ALL ACROSS THE INDUSTRY -- FROM OUR BED AND BREAKFAST TO OUR ECONOMY HOTELS LUXURY HOTELS.

VOICE SUPPORT. HI I AM ANDREW VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION I WANT TO APOLOGIZE WE DID NOT GET A LETTER IN ON TIME ON THIS BILL BUT WE DO SUPPORT IT AS WE BELIEVE THAT SOURCE REDUCTION IS REALLY THE KEY TO PLASTIC POLLUTION SOLUTIONS AND SO WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS. BILL. REMEMBER TROUBLING AS WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN STRONG SUPPORT. HI BRANDY GARCIA WITH READING GRAYSON SUPPORT. Q.. FOREIGN COMMERCE HERE CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. NOW NICK CARTER PRESIDENT FOUNDER CONNECTION EARTH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OKAY ARE OPPOSITION CONCERNS -- LET'S BE BACK TO ME AND BY THE WAY THIS IS DOUBLE OR FOR IS GOING OFF. TO GOVERN FINANCE TRAVEL OR FOR MY GOD. THAT'S LACKEY MANTLE REFLECT. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING OKAY IS GONNA GET SO MUCH SO MUCH EXAMINATION YES SO STRONG OKAY MADAM I STIR. JUST TWO QUESTIONS ARE ONE OF HIS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR PENALTY FINES. THERE'S THAT MANY INTENDING TO GO IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT. HOW DO YOU? SEE THAT. FUND DEVELOPING AND ITS USE. OF MOBILE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION MY MATTER BY CHER FIRST OF ALL WE HOPE THAT THERE WON'T BE A LOT OF OF FINES IMPOSED I THINK AS MENTIONED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE INDUSTRY. THIS IS A DIRECTION THAT TO THE INDUSTRY IS GOING IN AND SO IT'S NOT. AN INTENT -- TO TO TRY -- TO ASSERT FINES AND SO I'M HOPEFUL TO BE VERY VERY FEW FINDS FRANKLY AND YEAH. SO WHATEVER AGENCY IS THE ONE THAT IS CERTAIN THE FINAL A YOUNG GIRL WHO FOR CLASS MINISTRY OF PEACE FOR DOING SO AND SO -- THE ULTIMATELY -- THIS IS NOT A ANY KIND OF SCHEME TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CLEANING THE OCEANS ARE CLEAN PLASTIC IT'S REALLY A WAY TO KIND OF CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN THE INDUSTRY INTERACTION THERE ARE YOU GOING. I THINK GOING FORWARD THAT NEEDS TO BE A PRETTY CLEAR AND BECOME SOME FINDS THAT. ARE YOU KNOW ADMINISTERED AND FOR A VIOLATION OF THIS SECONDLY I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A HOTEL. THAT HAS THESE DISPENSERS THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE BY. 8% -- IN THAT ROOM AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS AROUND -- REGARDING THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT IS BEING PUT AT RISK. PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TENANTS IN THE ROOM CAN ACCESS FEES DISPENSERS THEY ALSO NEED TO BE REFILLED YEAH I MEAN SOME OF THIS IS A QUESTIONABLE REGARDING. THE SAFETY THE THE CLEANLINESS OF ALL OF THAT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WE REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH. CAREFULLY HOW THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER KIND OF JUST ANSWER THAT'S MORE RECYCLABLE THAN PLASTIC MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE. WE'VE SEEN THE RE RUSHING TO THERE SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT I HOPE THAT ARE -- YOU KNOW OUR TOURIST INDUSTRY WILL THINK ABOUT THAT. ALL THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD THEM JUST WITH THE PLASTIC BAGS THEY CAN BE CONTAMINATED SO YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE THEM ONE OR TWO TIMES AND THEN DISPOSE OF THEM. WE HAVE THESE LARGE BOTTLES THAT CONTAIN BODY LOTION CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO THEY'RE IN THEIR PLASTIC SO THEY'RE GONNA BE DISPOSED OF AWFUL. SO -- I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER ANSWER SOMEWHERE IN THERE -- AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS THE ANSWER FOR ME TODAY. THANK. THINK ABOUT MY SHIRT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS ALREADY A COMMON PRACTICE WHETHER YOU GO TO A JAM WITH YOU GO ON A CRUISE SHIP WITH THE YOU GO TO MANY HOTELS ARE READY -- I I I WOULD TRUST THE INDUSTRY AND VERY OUT FOR EXAMPLES AND HAVE TO TWO HUNDRED PROPERTY BUT THERE'S AND THIS YEAR THEY HAVE A LOT OF LAWYERS HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. THAT ARE PART OF THE MARRIOTT TEAM THAT I THINK THEY WOULDN'T EVEN DARE TO STEP FORWARD IN ONE HOTEL UNLESS THEY BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WOULD BE SECURE BECAUSE IT'S THEIR LIABILITY AT REST SO. I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS BILL WILL SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN INNOVATION IN TERMS OF SECURITY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS SAFE FOR EVERYONE TO USE. THANK YOU -- OTHER QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS IN THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT AND THE BILL'S REMOVED. IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU JOHN I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF STEPS THAT ARE THE LOWER HANGING FRUITS SO TO SPEAK.

TO INTEGRATED WITH MEASURE PLANS AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OPPOSITIONS THEY REMOVE THIS IS JUST THAT. ALL THIS OPPOSITION IS BEING REMOVED REMOVED TODAY HAS REWARDED A BILL HARD OKAY SO YOU MAY PRESENT WHEN WHEN. THE WHEN READY GREAT A GOOD AFTERNOON. I GUESS IT'S STILL MORNING SUSAN A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB EIGHT FIFTEEN ALLOWS CAL RECYCLED TO CONSIDER WHETHER A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A DUAL STREAMS AND RECYCLING PROGRAM. WHEN DETERMINING IF THEY MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET STATE RECYCLING GOALS TOOL STREAM PROGRAMS REQUIRE CURBSIDE SEPARATION OFTEN KEEPING PAPER SEPARATE FROM CONTAINERS? TO REDUCE CONTAMINATION RATES IN THE RECYCLING STREAM. IN COMPARISON WHEN WE THROW AT THE WHEN WE THROW ALL RECYCLES IN THE SAME BEEN. GLASS BREAKS LEFT OVER SO TO SPILLS AND COPY PAPER AND RECYCLED MATERIALS BECOME CONTAMINATED. CONTAMINATION REDUCES THE QUALITY OF OUR RECYCLABLES MAKING THEM DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO RIP MARKET FOR RE USE. WE USED TO SEND OVER HAVE ARE CONTAMINATED RECYCLES TO CHINA WHERE THEY WERE FREQUENTLY LANDFILLS ARE BURNED. THE CHINA ISN'T TAKING ARE CONTAMINATED RECYCLES ANYMORE. STILL STREAM PROGRAMS KEEP RECYCLED MATERIAL SEPARATED AND CLEANER IN THE WASTE STREAM. CLEAN STREAMS PROTECT THE QUALITY AND THE VALUE OF ARE RECYCLABLE SO THEY CAN BE SOLD TO MAKE NEW PRODUCTS. AB EIGHT FIFTEEN WILL ENCOURAGE LOCALS WITH EXISTING DRAWSTRING PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE OPERATING THOSE PROGRAMS. AND CONSIDER -- AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO CONSIDER SWITCHING. THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY LOCAL CONTROL OVER RECYCLING. AND IT DOES NOT GIVE CAL RECYCLE AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD A GOOD FAITH EFFORT DETERMINATION FROM JURISDICTIONS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A BOOK BUT DOLE STREAM. THIS BILL RECEIVE UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL SOURCES COMMITTEE AND PASSED OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR ON CONSENT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU. YES FOLKS IN SUPPORT. SORRY. GIVE ME THAT IMPLY THAT MY MICROPHONE PREMATURELY THERE ARE THOSE THREATS. MICRO HERE ON BEHALF THE GLASS PACKAGING STUDENTS SCORED THE BILL ON I THINK I'VE TOLD THIS COMMITTEE MEANT MANY TIMES CLASS GLASS BOTTLES ARE ABOUT THE MOST RECYCLABLE -- MATERIAL COMMODITY IN THE IN THE MARKET PLACE TO RECYCLE NOT DOWN CYCLE THE GLASS BOTTLE CAN BE 1% OF GLASS BOTTLES. IF IT'S PROPERLY HANDLED RECYCLED AND THAT THE SINGLE STREAM RECYCLING SYSTEM CURBSIDE RECYCLING SYSTEM HASN'T BEEN KIND TO CLASS OVER THE YEARS -- YOU GET GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MET -- DISCUSSED ON ON CHINA NATIONAL SORT IN AND THE AND THE COMMODITY MARKET PLACE WE THINK IT'S A GOOD A GOOD TIME TO START ENCOURAGING TOLL FREE RECYCLING IN. THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL THE DOES SO AND AND JUST -- I WOULD I JUST REFERRED TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- TO PAGE FOR THE COMMITTEE NOW OR THE COMIC NUMBER FORMED COMMITTEE NOW SAYS WHICH DISCUSSES THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE STORE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DISADVANTAGED A HOLLER OR COMMUNITY AND AND AND IN. REFER YOU TO THE ANALYSIS ON THAT AND I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. AND AS THE HEARING GOES OFF THANKS THANK YOU. OKAY -- FOLKS WANT TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. I COULD MORNING ACOSTA CALIFORNIA'S GETS WASTE WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL SUPPORT POSITION BUT WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF ENCOURAGING TO OCEAN COLLECTION -- I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS OR STAFF OF DONE A GREAT JOB OF GETTING STAKEHOLDERS THE OTHER FROM BOTH SIDES TRY.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TYLER BLOCKING THE ONE IN CEDAR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RESULTADOS HERE ON THE OFFICE ALWAYS ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN PLASTER WASTE MANAGEMENT THIRTY ONE THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US THAT'S FROM -- THIS PROCESS AND WE ARE -- AT ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE COMING IN AND WHIPS REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. BY ANYONE ELSE. REYES SUPPORT OR WINNERS -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL CONCERNS. YOU MAY COME UP. MORNING MR SURE MEMBERS KELLY ASTRON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. AND TO OTHER LOCAL REAL REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS WERE PART OF A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED ON JUNE FIFTH TO THE AUTHOR OF A COUPLE COMMENTS. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING FIRMS FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS -- I KNOWN OBJECTIVE -- ANALYSIS WHEN I SEE WHEN I WANT TO COMMEND COMMITTEE STAFFER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY. FAIR AND BALANCED ASSESSMENT OF THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE OF DUAL STREAM IS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED -- WE HAVE BY CAL RECYCLES BEST ESTIMATE FROM WHAT THEY TELL ME ABOUT TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS IMPLYING THIS PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY TODAY. WHICH MEANS THE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T. SOME OF THE BEEN MIGRATED AS I THINK PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS REFLECTS. FROM DUAL STREAM TO A SINGLE STREAM FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. I AM WILLING TO CONCEDE TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY THE DUAL STREAM CAN YIELD. AN OUTCOME THAT RESULTS IN LESS CONTAMINATION BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING WE LOOK AT WHEN WE BUILT THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. WASTE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS TODAY IT'S ALSO ABOUT VOLUME. AND MOVING A HECK OF A LOT OF MATERIAL THROUGH THE PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY WAS NOT GETTING RECYCLED AT ALL. SO WERE CONFRONTED WITH IS THIS. HUNDREDS OF HOLDERS OF CONSIDERED AND REJECTED BY IN BY NOT IMPLEMENTING THIS SYSTEM IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER SYSTEM. NOW RESPONSE I GET TO THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOESN'T COMPEL ANYTHING. BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE ALSO TRUE. NOTHING PROHIBITS THE CITY OR COUNTY FROM ADOPTING DUAL STREAM RECYCLING TODAY AND A HANDFUL HAVE. NOTHING PREVENTS CAL RECITE FROM CONSIDERING DAHLE STREAM RECYCLING AS PART OF A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TERMINATION TODAY WITHOUT EXPRESSLY CALLING ON THE CRITERIA. AND WHAT EIGHT FIFTEEN DOES IS IT BREAKS NEW GROUND BY SAYING NO THE EXISTING -- BUT BY SAYING THAT THIS PARTICULAR CRITERIA IT MERITS BEING CALLED OUT WHEN NONE OF THE OTHER CRITERIA FOR A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TERMINATION INVOLVES AN OPERATIONAL DECISION. ABOUT WHAT SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY TO USE. WE WOULD ALSO RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT INCENTIVIZE INDUSTRY BUT THIS TIME WE NEED TO STUDY IT GOES BEYOND. THE VERY ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY SOMETHING THAT MAKES ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT NOT JUST WEALTHY. COMMUNITIES WITH A HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION CAN IMPLEMENT TO SUCCESSFULLY THAT ALSO WORK IN RIALTO THAT WILL ALSO WORK IN RIVERSIDE -- OR 95% THIS STATE THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY USES SO WE'RE NOT AGAINST IT WE WE WOULD BECOME CONCERNED WITH A PARTICULAR -- AND TO THIS. EXTENT UNPOPULAR A METHODOLOGY GAINES AN INCENTIVE AND WHY DO WE CARE. BECAUSE INCENTIVES HAVE A NASTY HABIT OF BECOMING PREFERENCES AND FROM PURPOSES IT BECOME GOALS AND GOALS A BECOME MANDATES. WE ARE VERY MUCH OPEN AS AN INDUSTRY TO HAVING A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE WE'RE VERY MUCH OPEN TO A STUDY. THAT LOOKS AT DIVERSE AREAS OF THE STATE. BUT AT THE TIME WHEN WHEN OUR FOLKS ARE TRYING TO DEFEND THE CURRENT OPERATION GROWN EXPAND THEIR FACILITIES. THE IDEA THAT THESE STATES GOING TO SUBSIDIZE OWN JUDGMENT WHEN THERE ISN'T EVEN AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS AS BEING A PREFERRED TECHNOLOGY WE THINK IT'S ON WHY STEP WE DO ON THE OTHER HAND. ONE RECOGNIZE SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THIS BILL. I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF LAST YEAR TRYING TO GET. THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH NATIONAL SORT. AND SO HE IDEATHAT THIS AUTHOR HAS DECIDED TO TAKE UP SOME OF THAT MANTLE IS VERY PLEASING TO US WE WERE MUCH WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT PUT FORWARD BY HER STEP IN TRYING TO REACH A COMPROMISE. I THINK I SAID DURING BACK HERE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET SO WE'RE GONNA HEAR WILL MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT BUT I'D SURE LIKE THIS FIXED. BECAUSE I HATE TO SEE RECYCLERS DEBATING EACH OTHER ABOUT WHICH TECHNOLOGY OUGHT TO BE PREFERRED LET'S GET BETTER INFORMATION AS TO A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER GOOD FAITH EFFORT. CRITERIA SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M ALSO AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL THIS MONEY SHOULD THAT OKAY -- I MEAN I DO WHAT I WILL. YOU KNOW SAY THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY. THE BILL IS ASKING FOR CAROL TO CONSIDER -- YEAH SO IT'S IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT DISPOSITIVE I I GET THAT THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE SLIPPERY SLOPE BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT NEARLY ANY BILL THAT PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE -- SO. FIVE WITH THAT I'M I'M CERTAINLY -- AFTER WITH THE BILL TODAY. IN PASSING ON TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BILL IT'S PRETTY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND THAT'S OUR OTHER FOLKS WANNA RAISE CONCERNS OPPOSITION. OKAY -- TELECAST I GUESS -- ALAS THE AUTHOR'S DATA SUPPORTING THE CHANGE AND OTHERS A MILL VALLEY PILOT PROGRAM IS THAT. TRANSFERABLE TO LA AND WHAT WE HAVE ON THE DATA. AGENDA WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE -- TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS THAT USE DUAL STREAM TODAY SO WE DO HAVE SOME DATA THAT'S OUT THERE -- MILL VALLEY DID DO A A PILOT PROGRAM THAT THEY DEEMED VERY SUCCESSFUL YES IS IT A MORE LEAGUE MAYBE COMMUNITY THAN OTHERS BUT WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER JUPITER'S. JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE USING IT NOW. REMEMBER IS THAT I'M MY HEART GOES OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE GONE DOWN ONE OF PATH ARE RECYCLERS WHEN I WENT TO SINGLE STREAM. AND NOW SWITCHED TO DUAL STREAM -- WE'RE GIVING THE LOCALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIDE WHICH WHICH WAY THEY WANT TO GO -- AND I THINK IT IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO A LANDFILL RECENTLY WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. AND NOT USING THESE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS IS -- A COMMENDABLE FOR US TO TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE AND WHO WOULDN'T ON WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS GOING DOWN THIS PATH. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO BUT WE ARE. AND WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE SO. I GUESS I GUESS THEY FOLLOW UP MISTER CHAIR IS IS COULD THIS. CITIES CAN THIS LEAD. TO TO CONTAMINATED PENS THAT WE HAVE IF THE IF THE INDIVIDUALS TO HOMEOWNERS OUT DON'T. HAVE PRACTICE THE BEST PRACTICES I MEAN I KOW THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE A CONTAMINATED AND WE JUST. DUPLICATING THE SAME PROBLEM. WITHOUT THE EDUCATION I MEAN. SURE IF THE M. YOU GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT IS THAT THAT. CONSUMERS ARE GONNA BE LAZY THEY'RE GONNA BE LAZY AND WITH. THE THE FACT IS UNIT IN. TWO MINUTES ACTUALLY HELP HELP THE EDUCATION SO. YOU KNOW TO BE A BE A LOT EASIER IF YOU'RE CONSUMER YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO GAS AT WHAT IS IT. WHAT GOES INTO WHAT BEEN AT WORK -- FORECAST WEATHER STEVEN RECYCLABLE YOU'LL NOTICE RECYCLABLE BECAUSE A GLASS BOTTLE IS RECYCLABLE. IS A IS A IS A DIRTY PIZZA CARTON RECYCLABLE WILL NOW AND IT SHOULDN'T GO ANY IT SHOULDN'T GO IN EITHER BEEN AND SHOULD GO IN THE GARBAGE BUT YOU KNOW -- AND AND JUST ON THE ON ON ON THE STUDIES -- I I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT THE WASTE INDUSTRIES GONNA KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO -- THE THE WASTE INDUSTRY HAS KNOWN THE PROBLEM OF OF OF THE AFTER MARKET OF OF THE OF THE OF THE CURBSIDE. AMINATION PROBABLY GONNA FOR A LONG TIME IT JUST HASN'T MATTERED IT NOW MATTERS AND SO IF THEY IF IF IF IF THEY WERE PAIRED TO DEAL WITH THIS ON THEIR OWN. AND AND IN TWENTY TWELVE OR TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THAT WIND WHEN CHINA OPERATED THE YOU KNOW PUT IN GREEN FENCE. WE WOULD BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE MOVING SLOW AND AND NOBODY'S EXPECTING ANYTHING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT NOBODY'S GONNA IS EXPECTING ANYTHING GIVEN THE DISADVANTAGES. IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION WITH THEIR HOLLERS AND AND WITH THEIR MURDERS ON CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE GONNA RENEW OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AND AND AND AND IT'LL ALL IT'LL IT'LL SORT ITSELF OUT OF THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN SOME. VERY MODEST BILL THAT ENCOURAGES. YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF DAHLE FREE RECYCLING IN EVERYBODY WILL DO THEIR OWN STUDY WHEN THEY MAKE THAT DECISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MR. THREE CHAIR IF IF AFTER THE SALE IS OUR GUEST. I'M SURE THAT THE WASTE INDUSTRIES VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GLASS INDUSTRY FOR HELPING US FIGURE OUT OUR JOB. OF LET ME SAY THIS IF ONE BILLS OF MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY TODAY TO MANAGE JUST MATERIAL ONE'S GOING TO SPEND ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON AVERAGE. THAT IS PAID FOR OVER A TERM THAT APPROXIMATES TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS TO LESSEN THE IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS. THOSE FACILITIES ARE OPERATED BASED ON PRE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN PRE GREEN FENCE TECHNOLOGY. MASSIVE THROUGHPUT EXTRAORDINARY CONTENT EXTRAORDINARY A COLLECTION RESULTS OR AND RECOVERY RESULTS BUT NOT AS GOOD IF WE SLOWED EVERYTHING DOWN. PICKED IT UP ITEM BY ITEM AND SPENT TWO OR THREE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH ON EACH HOUSE RECYCLING THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WITH THE EFFICIENCIES WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR IS RESULT OF NINE THIRTY NINE WE LOST A LITTLE SOMETHING IN TERMS OF CONTAMINATION BUT WE PICKED UP EXTRAORDINARY GAINS. IN TERMS OVER OVERALL VOLUME IN CHINA IN THE FAR EAST WERE ACCEPTING ALL OF THIS JUST THE WHAT. WE WE PROCESS TO THE DEGREE THAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR THE MARKET BOARD UNTIL A YEAR AGO SO WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE WE'RE DIFFERENT STATE OF AFFAIRS NOW WE'RE ADJUSTING TO THAT. BUT THE IDEA THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO STEP IN WITH A PREFERENCE OR INSTEAD OF GETS ITS DECIDED. BASED ON I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STUDY. ONE OF THE THREE STUDIES CITED TO ME SAMPLE THIRTEEN OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MERSON CALIFORNIA REALLY. ARE WE PREPARED TO GO THERE YET ON THAT STUDY MILL VALLEY I WISH I LIVED THERE WILL MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD. BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE AT ALL REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO DEAR WHAT OTHER CITIES WITH DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO. SLAP OPAL. END OF THE STUDY OUT OF ONTARIO CANADA. I READ THE AT LEAST THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THAT I'VE GOT-MY PEOPLE LOOKING AT IT. UNDERSTAND ONE THING AND ALL STOP TALKING [INAUDIBLE] ENTREPRENEURS. ISN'T THERE ARE LEFT IN THE POSITION OF GREATEST RISK IF THEY MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE. THEY WANT MORE THAN ANYBODY SO IT'S NOT EVEN JUST ALTRUISM ON THEIR PART IT'S THE ECONOMIC REALITY UP IF THEY DON'T DELIVER THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE REQUIRED THE LOSE THE CONTRACT THEY DON'T GET TO REPAY THE BOND ON THE FACILITY IT'S IS NO MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. IF THIS WERE THE ANSWER THEY'D BE DOING IT FIVE HUNDRED PLUS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT YET DOING IT. SHOULD THEY MIGRATE TO THAT PERHAPS LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT STUDY BUT TO START OURSELVES DOWN THE PATH BECAUSE GLASS FEELS IT'S A GOOD IDEA. BY THE WAY THE DEFINITION OF DUAL STREAMING HERE DON'T EVEN MENTION GLASS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING PAPER. AND SEPARATELY DEALING WITH THAT PAPER DOES NOT AND TO CONTAMINATE GLASS THAT'S NOT THEIR ISSUE. THERE ISSUES BOTTLE CAPS AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN GET CLEANER WE CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WE'RE JUMPING THE GUN HERE THE EVIDENCE IS NOT IN THE BILL'S TO THAT EXTENT. PREMATURE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO BILL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE INDUSTRY THAT ONCE CLEANER COLLECT COULD. WORK WITH US TO GET THE SPIRITS IN THE WIND INDUSTRY IN THE BOTTLE BILLS. ALL PARTICIPATING EQUALLY -- WORK AS A BETTER STREAM SO WITH THAT ALMOST. I KNOW THAT JOBS OFFICES WORKING WITH OPPOSITION ON SNAPCHAT LE LET RULING SOME ISSUES AND REYES MEANING THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT. I THINK SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS. ARE VERY LEGITIMATE BUT THEIR THEIR BROADER THAN THE THE BIGGER THE SCOPE OF THE BILL THEN THE SCOPE OF THE WILL BILLS WRITTEN SO -- WITHOUT I'M CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE FOR THAT MISSED MINIMIZED HER I JUST WANT TO THINK OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY ON THAT I THINK HE'S RAPPORT THE CONCERNS THAT I WOULD HAVE FOR MY SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. WE STARTED THE NUMBER. RIGHT OUT WE WERE NEWLY INCORPORATED CITIES. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WE'VE BEEN MEETING OUR REQUIREMENT AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WITH THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF THE FROM THE AND SENTENCE OF DEATH. THAT COULD START TO CAUSE CITIES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIRTY FOUR CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT COULD BE AFFECTED. WITH FIVE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND NOT MEETING -- DIVERSION SO MAYBE A SLOWER PACE WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MR ANSWERS ROUTE FORWARD -- REALLY MERIT -- CONSIDERATION AS THIS MOVES FORWARD SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY -- BUT I WANT YOU KNOW INCORPORATING WITHIN THE GAL THIRTY YEARS AGO WHICH I WAS VERY INVOLVED WITH WE'VE DONE A HECK OF A JOB ON DEATH AND ARE CITIES IN THE EDUCATION THAT'S GONNA IS MEN INCREDIBLE. SO WHERE EDUCATION NEED FOR THE LAWN WE NEED TO GIVE THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY A LITTLE MORE TIME. I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK ABOUT THE MATCH THAT I'VE VISITED. THAT WOULD BE ON PUT ON RATE PAYERS -- BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE TO GO AND SOME NOT CONTINUE IN THEIR CONTRACTS BECAUSE OF THAT. SO THERE ARE CONCERNS SIGNIFICANT ONES BUT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE ALL AT THE TABLE YOU'RE GONNA POUNDED OUT TODAY I'M GONNA WAY ON THE SIDE OF MY MY DISTRICT AND MY PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IF THIS. CAME OUT SOMETHING IMMEDIATE HIM DOWN THEY START -- WITH THEIR CONTRACT THAT ARE COMING UP THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS SO. WITHOUT GETTING. RIGHT THANK YOU. IT'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE -- BROADLY SPEAKING BUT AND I WATCH ON LIKE LAUGH GOOD. GOOD GOOD GOOD -- SO THE BILL'S MOVE YOU MAY CLOSE -- I JUST WANNA REMIND EVERYONE -- THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO CONSIDER. WHETHER THE JURISDICTION HAS A DUAL STREAM RECYCLING PROGRAM SUCH AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE JURISDICTION IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL RESOURCE REDUCTION. RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING COMPOSTING ACTIVITIES OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT JURISDICTION HAS MAY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES DRIVEN BY CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE -- I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN A SENATOR -- I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE NOW START YOUR COMMUNITY MAYBE DOING IT BUT WE HAVE MANY OTHERS THAT WANT TO GET ON BOARD. AND I THINK THIS IS A THE BILL TO GET THEM THE FRAME WORK TO DO GOOD TO GO FOR IT -- DO WE NEED OTHER BILLS PROBABLY IN THE FUTURE PROBABLY YES BUT THIS IS THE THE BEGINNING SO I APPRECIATE COMMENTS AND I SIMPLY ASKED RIVALS.

WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER AGENCIES THAT IMPACT AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN -- BEING THOSE GOALS IN MIND WHEN THEY DO THEIR PLANNING BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR HAS BEEN GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES TO EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WITH EMISSIONS ACTUALLY INCREASING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE PLANNING AGENCIES INCORPORATE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION AS PART OF THEIR PLANNING PROCESS. I'M THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK INSTEAD OF TRANSPORTATION REQUIRE THAT OP REPORT ON THE PROGRESS THAT CAL CHANCES CALTRANS HAS MADE. I'M IMPLEMENTING PLAST TRANSPORTATION PLANS. IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT OUR AGENCY SHOULD BE HELD. TO TASK AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE GOALS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAS SAT CALTRANS HAS FAILED TO DO THAT AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO. I ENACT THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE ALL -- ASKED OUR AGENCIES TO DO WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS WELL BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. I'M AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING I'M WILL BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE AS A COMMON SENSE OF STATE. TO THE REQUIREMENTS IN OUR STATE TRANSPORTATION PLANS. ONE CESSATIONS TWENTY NINETEEN STATE OF THE ERROR REPORT FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SEVEN OF THE TEN MOST POLLUTED. IN THE UNITED STATES BY OZONE AND THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAKING THE JOB OF CLEANING UP OUR AIR THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. TRANSPORTATION SOURCES ARE THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF ON HEALTHCARE AND GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA. THESE POLLUTANTS CONTRIBUTE TO ASTHMA ATTACKS CANCERS HEART ATTACKS IN A WIDE AND GROWING RANGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH IMPACTS. AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE ENSURES THAT THE STATE TRANSPORTATION PLANS ACCOUNT FOR TREATMENT OF STATE AND FEDERAL. POLLUTION REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS INTERSTATE GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS. GIVEN THE TRANSPORTATION CARBON POLLUTION IS INCREASING AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT OF REGIONAL% SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES AND EVALUATION OF HOW THOSE PLANS. INTERACT WITH OUR OVERALL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THIS IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR TRANSPORTATION AND POLLUTION REDUCTION PLANNING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND MUST BE PART OF OUR LONG TERM PLANNING PROCESSES. AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE ALSO REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS WITHIN THE PLANS IN RECOGNITION THAT MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. USING DISPROPORTIONATELY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS. GIVEN THE URGENCY TO ALIGN OUR TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND INVESTMENTS WITH. THE TREATMENT OF CLEAN AIR PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOBILITY GOALS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE THIRTEEN AT THE ANALYSIS CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF US OF A BUS RAPID TRANSIT STATION. THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOP EXCLUDES MANY HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT OPTIONS AS A RESULT AREAS ACROSS THE STATE SERVE BY HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT DO NOT. QUALIFY FOR DIFFERENT LOCAL INCENTIVES AND EXEMPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IS MAXIMIZED NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE ORANGE LINE WHICH IS ONE OF LA MATTRESS BUSIEST LINES DOES NOT QUALIFY AS MAJOR TRANSIT DESPITE HAVING DOES A KIT DESIGNATED LANES IT'S SEPARATED FROM THE ROAD -- IT HAS TRANSIT SECOND PRIORITY AND ALL DOOR BOARDING IT BASICALLY ACTS LIKE LIGHT RAIL FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES IT'S LIKE A LIGHT RAIL WITHOUT THE TRACKS -- BUT IT DOESN'T QUALIFY THE WAY THAT MANY LESSER USE LIGHT RAIL PROJECTS OR RAIL PROJECTS AND LOT IN LOS ANGELES I'M DO. AB FIFTEEN SIXTY REVISED REVISES THE DEFINITION OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOP TO INCLUDE BUS RAPID TRANSIT AND DEFIES BUS RAPID TRANSIT SPECIFICALLY TO ESTABLISH GREATER STANDARDS FOR HIGH QUALITY TRANSPORTATION AND ALSO TO CLARIFY THIS ONLY WERE -- APPLIES UNDERLIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE STOP ITSELF -- WITH THE DEFINITIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE ADDED TO NARROW THAT TO MAKE SURE THEY TRULY ARE HIGH QUALITY SO IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE BUS AT THE STOP ITSELF. THIS DEFINITION IS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE AND IT'S TIME TO REFINE THE DEFINITION OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOP AND TO ALLOW AREAS THAT HAVE MADE THE INVESTMENT IN THIS KIND OF HIGH QUALITY RAPID TRANSIT. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING INCENTIVES AND BENEFITS TO CREATE MORE HOUSING IN THESE DENSE URBAN AREAS. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS STORED WALDMAN OF THE VALLEY INDUSTRY AND AND COMMERCE ASSOCIATION BETTER KNOWN LOCALLY AS VIKA. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION THAT WE KNOW OF AND IS NOT RECEIVED ANY NO VOTES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE -- AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN STATED I'M STORE WALDMAN REPRESENTING BIKE -- WE REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAN FERNANDO VALLEY REGION. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- ON THE ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SIXTY WHICH WOULD HELP MAXIMIZE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT NEAR HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT -- BY AMENDING THE DEFINITION OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOP. RECENTLY IN LOS ANGELES THE VOTERS HAVE PASSED A MEASURE CALLED JJJ -- WHICH INCENTIVIZE TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES -- AND IT -- ALIGNED WITH THE STATE DEFINITION. BUT IT FAILED TO INCLUDE. BUS RAPID TRANSIT SO THIS IS A CHANGE THAT WILL ALLOW US. TO PORTABLE HOUSING ALONG THE ORANGE LINE [INAUDIBLE] I BEING HEARING -- DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU SIR OTHER FOLKS WHO WANNA. VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE GOOD MORNING YELLING HAVOC WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ENTRANCE WE WAS CHARGER AMPLY WE'RE PROVIDING TWEENER TESTIMONY THIS MORNING SUPPORT ASH. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR HONOR YOU'RE NOT A ON BEHALF OF PHILLY METRO -- WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE AUTHOR. WE THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE WE'RE VERY. OF THE ORANGE LINE THE RECORD BREAKING RIDERSHIP TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PASSENGERS PER DAY. AND WE THINK THE DEFINITION OF MAJOR CRIMES ARE STOPPING UP YOUR UPGRADED IN THIS WAY MAKES PERFECT SENSE. AND B. R. T. WE WE PLAN TO REPLICATE THAT KIND OF SCCESS CALVET. THANK YOU OKAY. I ANYONE ONE THREE OPPOSITION -- CONCERNS ABOUT. ALL RIGHT TO THE MATTER IS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTION SPOTS. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A SEMINAR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD INTO THE SPONSORS. PORTS LINE STARTS IN. THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT I DON'T KNOW PARK [INAUDIBLE] AND FRANKLY. YOU KNOW RIDERSHIP IS EXCELLENT RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK IT'S ONLY A BEGUN I THINK THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY. GOT A MAINSTREAM THAT LINE AND MAKE IT. PLACE THAT'S FINE AND EXCITING AND SAFE WAY TO MOVE AROUND FOR ANYBODY. I WANNA GO DOWNTOWN AND I WANT TO SIT ON ONE ONE FOUR FIVE AND IF WE FIND A WAY TO START TO BE BACK. AND YES I'M CONNECTED ME THROUGH THE WHOLE REGION HAVE A TRANSIT BOARD ALSO GOING -- OVER THOSE HILLS THAT FOUR FIVE QUARTERS IT TO ME THIS IS. TO THE START OF SOME AND I I'M NOT READY TO CELEBRATE. FULLY THE ORANGE LINE YET. THE VISION I THINK THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT PART OF IT -- SO I'M I'M EXCITED SPORT THE BILL I I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE THERE'S THERE NOW THIS IS BROUGHT UP THIS OPTION ONE OPTION TO ISSUE. YES I AM ANY COMMENTS ON THAT IN TERMS OF I I JUST NED TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE OF THE OPTION NOW THE ARE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW LIKE YOU [INAUDIBLE] FOR ANNOUNCES SAYS -- THERE'S NO MINIMUM FREQUENCY REQUIREMENTS WELL ACTUALLY THIS THAT MEMONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN THERE'S FIVE CRITERIA THAT THE STOP PASSED TO ME. SO IT HAS TO BE FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS DURING PEAK TIMES IT HAS TO BE ALL DOOR BOARDING IT HAS TO BE SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION. IT NEEDS. TO THERE'S ONE THAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC BUT IT HAS TO ALLOW FOR A LOADING OF YOUR FARE BEFORE AT THE STATION. THE ONLY REASON I THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC AS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGING TO WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOUR PHONE WILL DO IT THROUGH AN APP WHICH BE AT THE STATION. SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED AS TO THAT WERE SORT OF LIMITED TECHNOLOGY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER CRITERIA WHICH OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD -- YEAH YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BUS SHELTER SO IT'S PRETTY STRICT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CRITERIA ARE FOR THE STATIONS AND IF THERE'S A STATION THAT FOR SOME REASON MAYBE. MAYBE THEY SKIP IT IS LIKE I'M NOT EXPRESSED OP OR SOMETHING LIKE THE WAY THEY DO IN SOME PRICING SOME STATIONS THAT ONE MY COURT NOT. BY BUT THE OTHER STATIONS WELL DOES NOT A MENU IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE I THINK THIS GROUP HERE VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE I ALSO ON ON THE VENTURA COUNTY CITED THE DISTRICT. THERE'S THERE ARE SOME INTERSPERSED TRANSIT OPTIONS BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND I WOULDN'T CALL THEM. AT A MAJOR TREND I STOPPED THAT WERE THING ABOUT HERE SO YES ORANGE LINE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A TODAY BY SAID A SENIOR VALLEY THAT'LL HOKEY AND YOU KNOW TO THE OXNARD LIKE. THAT ACT SO IN TERMS OF THE REFINED I THINK THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS AN IS IN AND HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL I HEARD I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IT'S ALREADY BEEN. SO. THIS DEFERRED CHAIR THANK YOU I GUESS. WHEN I FIRST READ IT DOES SEEM LIKE AN INNOCUOUS BILL IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT NO TRANSPORTATION GROUPS OR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE COME FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE IDEA? I WONDER WHY IS THAT SO. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA. I BUSINESS PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THE EXEMPTION BUT I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT NORMAL TRANSPORTATION VIRAL GROUP SAID I WOULD EXPECT. TO COME FORWARD AFTER THEY DID THE ANALYSIS. YEAH THE POINT I WISH THAT THEY WOULD. IS YOUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION NEXT IS THAT WE CAN MARY CLEARASIL THE WHOLE POINT OF DOING TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. IS SO THAT YOU HAVE COULD YOU CREATE CITIES ARE MORE. ACCESSIBLE BY MASS TRANSIT SO YOU REDUCE SPRAWL YOU ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT AROUND YOUR MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS SO. WITHOUT THE LAND USE PIECE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO HIT OUR MISSION SCHOOLS WERE NEVER GONNA STOP SPRAWL AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF WITH THIS MEASURE IS TO ENCOURAGE. WHEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP THE PLACE YOU'RE GOOD YOU SHOULD BE DEVELOPING IS NEAR? I'VE MASS TRANSIT WHERE IT'S AVAILABLE PEOPLE WE'VE MADE THOSE MAJOR INVESTMENTS. AND SO -- THAT THERE IS THAT CONNECTION. I I MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT I DIDN'T SEE THAT THERE'S ASSURANCES THAT IT'S TIED. TO A SMART GROWTH DEVELOPMENT OR IT ALLOWS FOR THE TYPE OF STREAMLINING THAT YOU WOULD GET. WHAT'S CONSIDERED HIGH PRIORITY TRANSIT. SO FOR PURPOSES OF ANY OTHER. DENSITY BONUSES THAT SORT OF THING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW THAT CONNECTION. I MEAN FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH. I'M OPEN TO HELPING. IF IT IF WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR NEXUS TO GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OR INTEGRATION WITH THIS BE THREE SEVENTY FIVE PLANNING OR TO THE YOU KNOW SORT OF BROADER. DMT REDUCTION TARGETS IN THE REGION THAT THROUGH SKAGGS MAYBE THERE'S SOME KIND OF CROSS REFERENCE THAT WOULD BOLSTER. WE CAN ACTIVITY THE CONNECTIVITY YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT REALLY IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO FREE UP THESE. TO CALL THIS MAJOR TRANSIT. THERE'S A HIGH PRIORITY TRANSIT DOES ENJOY SOME BENEFITS BY. YOU KNOW SORT OF BY THE LEGISLATURE BY LOCALITIES AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR INSTANCE AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ORANGE LINE AND I FAR AS I KNOW ONLY THE ORANGE LINE AT THIS POINT. TO QUALIFY BECAUSE IT IS SO NARROWLY DEFINED SO IT WOULDN'T BE DOESN'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY OTHER OR MANY OTHER BUS RAPID TRANSIT THAT QUALIFY AT THIS POINT. BUT THIS MIGHT SPUR YOU KNOW MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING THEM IN AREAS WHERE WE FEEL. THEY CAN BE OF BENEFIT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S EXTENDING. THE INVESTMENT OF THE MASS TRANSIT TO NOW ALSO ENJOY THE OTHER AND BENEFITS THAT HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT OFFERS NEAR NEAR HER RAIL STATIONS MAYBE THE RIGHT VENUE THEN IS MAKING SURE THE THE PLANNING PROCESS RUN ORANGE LINE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT IS CLEARLY. REDUCING EMISSIONS WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF YOU KNOW GETTING MEASURE M. ARE AND EVERYTHING OUT THERE. TO GET THE VALLEY. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT ON TRACK EVENTUALLY [INAUDIBLE] BUT YES MAYBE MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON AS THE BILL IF THE BILL MOVES FOR JUST TO ARTICULATE IN A FINDING OR SOME NEXUS THERE THEY CAN MAKE IT CLEAR [INAUDIBLE] OPEN THAT. YEAH I'M. THIS IS GOING TO HOUSING I WOULD LIKE I'M GONNA STAY OFF AND I I WANT TO HELP THE BILL TO MOVE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE. I CROSS ALL T. ISN'T THAT THE ICE ON THIS ONE SO NOT. I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE OKAY. I DO FOR YOU. ACCEPTING. DEMANDS IN WORKING WITH US AND YOU KNOW I I I I THINK WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET WHERE SHE WAS TRYING TO DO I'M. I THINK AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T. GO SO FAR BEYOND. WHAT WE COMMONLY KNOWN TO BE A BUS RAPID TRANSIT STATION AND TO TO PUT THAT IN THERE WAS A RISK HERE THAT THAT WE WOULD GET TO THAT WE WOULD START TO CALL ANY. IN A BUS STOP -- WHERE PEOPLE ARE YEAH BY NINETY MINUTE NO WOULD ONLY AGREE AND AND THAT I JUST AND AND AND BY THE WAY IF WE WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THAT OUGHT TO BE? PART OF THE HOUSING. YEAH I STREAMLINING MAKES LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION THAT'S KIND OF WHAT. OUR FRIEND THE CHAIR OF HOUSING COMMITTEE WAS TRYING TO DO WITH HIS. ENORMOUS BILL BUT I'M. WE WE ALL WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATUTE WAS ACTUALLY BEING TRUE. TO TO TO WHAT WE KNOW. IS BUS RAPID TRANSIT RATHER THAN THAN JUST REGULAR BUS STOP SO. I WITH THAT I'M I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND AND YOU'RE ACCEPTING OF THE AMENDMENTS AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THIS YEAR WHILE MINUTES OF OF THIS BILL I'M GONNA RECOMMEND AYE. I HAVE A VERY HIGH. ON THIS BILL IN AND DONE IT DOESN'T MOVED IN -- WITHOUT AYE AYE AT SUCH A PLEASE CALL. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AB FIFTEEN SIXTY MOTIONS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE [INAUDIBLE] I HILL [INAUDIBLE] SKINNER [INAUDIBLE] STERN.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK EVERYBODY THINKS RIVER DISSIPATION. AND GO U. S. WOMEN. STORE WILL BE THERE AT THE FINAL. OKAY. OKAY SO NEXT NEXT YEAR FROM DECEMBER CHOOSE YOUR PRESENT ITEM SIX A. B.. TWO OH SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATORS AB TWO OH SIX WOULD PROTECT PROPERTY OWNERS FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS IF THEY PARTICIPATE. IN LEAD ABATEMENT LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS THIS ISSUE AS SOME OF YOU KNOW COMES OUT OF A LANDMARK LEGAL DECISION THAT FOUND LEAD PAINT COMPANIES LIABLE. FOR KNOWINGLY PROFITING FROM PROFITS FROM PRODUCTS WITH DOCUMENT HEALTH RISKS INCLUDING A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE. THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW REQUIRED TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO A LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAM. PHILIPPINE COMPANIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT TWO SENTENCES IN PCOURT DECISION MIGHT LEAD TO LAWSUITS AGAINST HOMEOWNERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. WHILE THOSE LAWSUITS WOULD BE FRIVOLOUS THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT COULD DETER PARTICIPATION SO THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT. SUPPORTED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AS WELL AS TENANT ORGANIZATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND I WANT. TO APPRECIATE THE UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN COMMITTEES AND ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. JAMIE HEALING DELAY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE LEAD PAINT. LITIGATION THAT'S UNDER. ONLINE THIS BELL AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS LITIGATION IS IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR NINETEEN YEARS AND WE ARE NOW AT THE FINISH LINE WE HAVE. A HEARING ON MONDAY TO HAVE A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN THIS CASE IT WOULD GIVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE TEN JURISDICTIONS FOR LEAD ABATEMENT. BUT THERE'S A CATCH WE HAVE ONLY FOUR YEARS TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND TO THE EXTENT WE ARE UNABLE TO SPEND THAT ON LEAD ABATEMENT IT WILL GO BACK. TO THE DEFENDANT LEAD PAINT COMPANIES THAT BECAUSE THIS NUISANCE AB TWO OH SIX IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY IS SPENT ON LEAD ABATEMENT AND PROTECTS FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS FROM IRREPARABLE LEAD POISONING. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES MA'AM. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE SAFER HOUSING -- IT ONLY PROVIDES AT THE MERE PARTICIPATION ON THE PART OF A LANDMARK IN THE COMMITTEE CANNOT BE GROUNDS AE EVIDENCE FOR A VIOLATION. IT DOESN'T HOWEVER PROVIDE IMMUNITY TO A LANDLORD WHO HAS SUBSTANDARD HOUSING CONDITIONS OR WHO HARMS TENANTS THROUGH THE PROCESS. OR WHO HAS PROVIDED SOME SORT OF HARM PRIOR TO THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE IMMUNITY FOR THAT. SO WITH THAT WE BELIEVE IN WE WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THOSE COMMENTS WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE. WOULD YOU REALLY NEVER IN SUPPORT OF BILL. FOR MORE TO MEET AN ABSOLUTE. THE CODE ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT VERY STRESSED ACTIONS WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT BILL. CORRECT OKAY MISTER CHAIR. I'M OF THE BILL WE WERE. WE HEARD THE LEGAL DISTINCTIONS AND JUDICIARY AND AS FAR AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS I HAVE NO OF NO CONCERNS ALMOST. WE DO APPRECIATE THAT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH THE PRODUCT OF PROJECT OF CONAGRA ENSURING SURE WHEN WILLIAMS TO THE THREE DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE THINK IT'S AN HONOR. TO SHOW A VIOLATION OF OUR DO. WITH RESPECT TO THE UNDERLYING CASE -- YOU KNOW FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT THE BILL AND WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY POLICY AND HOW WE LOOK AT THESE TYPES OF ISSUES IN THE PAST WHETHER IT BE GROUND WATER WHETHER IT BE. TOXIC WASTE FACILITIES WHETHER IT BE ANY NUMBER OF OTHER CHEMICALS PCP. YOU KNOW THE STATE TYPICALLY SAYS LOOK WE'RE GOING TO HOLD EVERYBODY LIABLE WE'RE GONNA BRING THEM ALL AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS THING FIXED AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LT THEM FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES AS TO AS TO WHO. IS GOING TO PAY HOW MUCH OF WHAT. I WILL STIPULATE RIGHT NOW AS WAS JUST MENTIONED THERE'S YOU KNOW THIS CASE IS APPROACHING A FINAL JUDGMENT MY CLIENTS ARE GOING TO PAY. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE FIRST DOLLAR INTO REMEDIATION FUND WITH THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. AND HOW IT IS THERE CONTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF HOMEOWNERS LANDLORDS AND OUR MAJOR CONCERN SLUMLORDS IN THIS -- IN THIS STATE WHO -- SHOULD ALSO AT LEAST NOMINALLY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE CONDITION OF SOME OF THE HOMES THAT WILL BE REMEDIATED. WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE THE PICTURE THAT EVERYONE HAS IN THEIR HEAD OF THE HOMEOWNER THERE THINKING UP. WHO? SHOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS REMEDIATION FUND NO ISSUES WITH THAT BUT WE DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SLUMLORDS. AND THERE'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY HERE THIS BILL GRANT THEM IMMUNITY AND THEN THE UNDERLYING COURT DECISION PUTS THEM FIRST IN LINE FOR THE REMEDIATION FUNDS AND SO. THERE'S CONCERN THERE ABOUT YOU KNOW ARE THEY GOING TO SUCK UP ALL THE FUNDS BEFORE THE FOLKS YOUR THINKING ABOUT. ACTUALLY CAN GET ANY. LAST YOU KNOW I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I DO WE DO NOT WE UNDERSTAND THE THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL REYES BY THE THE SUPPORTERS AND THE AND THE AUTHOR BUT THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO ADDRESS THIS. WITH THIS BILL COULDN'T SAY ANYONE ANY. LANDLORD WITH TEN OR MORE HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM. THIS BILL COULDN'T SAY -- ANYONE WITH TEN OR MORE HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS. THE CITY AND COUNTY OF YOU KNOW THAT'S OUT IN FORCING THE LOCAL HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES. MAY ISSUE A CITATION THAT MANDATES THE REMEDY THAT THEY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FOR MEDIATION PROGRAM. THIS BILL COULDN'T SAY SOMETHING LIKE. YOU KNOW. HOMEOWNERS ARE PROTECTED SLUMLORDS CAN GET SUED IN ANY RECOVERY FROM THAT CAN BE SOMEHOW SPLIT BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS. ARE MANY OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER THAN GRANTING THE BROAD IMMUNITY OF THIS BILL. FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO MAP IT ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU. FOR SHOULD ANY OTHER FOLKS WANNA RAISE CONCERNS ARE OF THIS VOTE. OKAY TO THE MATTERS REFERRED ME I I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE -- TO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID WE DID LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THESE KIND OF FUN. COMMUNITY ISSUES JUDICIARY SHE'S OVER IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND NUMBER OF US WERE NOT. WE'RE IN A DISCUSSION BUT I I I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW FOLLOWING UP IN THE COMMENT WAS MADE BY THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT THAT. THEY WOULD NEVER SUPPORT IMMUNITY FOR SOME WORDS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS I LOVE TAKE LIKE ASK THE AUTHOR ABOUT. THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- THURMOND REAL SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE WITH THE ROLE THAT THE PAIN INDUSTRY. HAS PLAYED IN THE PAST -- AND INDEED SOME OF THESE YOU HAVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SO THEY REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN SAFE. I'M OF COURSE THEIR MOST DANGEROUS AND THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT WELL MAINTAINED. I AND HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE ARE HOLDING THE PAIN INDUSTRY. JUSTIFIABLY ACCOUNTABLE THERE WERE ALSO MAKING SURE THE OTHER FOLKS ARE NOT LEFT I'M OFF THE HOOK. WHEN THEY HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OUT OF THERE IN THIS AREA? WELL ANSWER THE QUESTION IN A COUPLE IS FIRST OF ALL -- WITH WITH GREAT RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION -- THIS IS A VERY NARROW COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S BEING CARVED OUT OF THIS BILL WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT IF A HOMEOWNER WERE TO TAKE. WERE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SOME DOLLARS FROM THIS FUN. THEY COULD BE SUED FOR THAT AMOUNT -- WE ADDED LANGUAGE AS WE DISCUSSED AND SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS LAW WILL NOT ALTER ANY EXISTING OBLIGATIONS ON HOMEOWNERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR OTHERWISE LIMIT ATTENDANCE LEGAL REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT ON A TWILIGHT SO. WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT AGAIN THE SLUMLORDS AS ENGAGE ABOUT ACTIVITY ANYONE CAN GO AFTER THEM. EXCEPT WHERE IT'S RELATED TO SIMPLY TAKING DISSIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT THE TENANT ORGANIZATIONS AND WESTERN CENTER OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS ALL OF THE CITIES. THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING LAWS AGAINST LANDLORDS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW NEAR IT IS BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT ONCE YOU OPEN UP THE DOOR. TO SAY THAT THE PAINT COMPANIES COULD POTENTIALLY BRING EVEN ONE LAWSUIT AGAINST ONE LANDLORD YOU DETER PARTICIPATION THIS PROGRAM WHAT THE THE PAIN COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO DO. IS TO SLOW DOWN THE RATE AT WHICH THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE USED OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT MONEY GETS OUT IN GEORGIA RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND I JUST WANT TO ASK IF THE CITY ATTORNEY. FROM OUR SEE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH I WOULD ADD. I WOULD ADD THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES WANT TO THREATEN TO SUE ANYONE THOSE LAWSUITS WOULD BE FRIVOLOUS AND WITHOUT ANY BASIS IN LAW. THE COURT OF APPEAL ALREADY HELD IN THIS CASE THE EAD PAINT COMPANIES WERE LIABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR THEIR BEHAVIOR OF MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTING AND PROMOTING LEAD PAINT. IN THE TEN JURISDICTIONS NO LANDLORDS SLUM LORD OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATED IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE COURT OF APPEAL ALREADY HELD IN THIS CASE. THAT NO HOME OWNER IS A JOINT PORT FEES ARE AND THEREFORE COULD BE SUED SUCCESSFULLY FOR CONTRIBUTION FIVE LEAD PAINT COMPANY. SO THE ONLY THING THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES WANT TO DO HERE IS BRING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THEY WOULD LOSE TO DETERMINE. PATIENT IN THE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY GET THEIR MONEY BACK ON THE AND AND WE DON'T SPEND IT ON LET IT BE. OKAY MA'AM AYE SIR. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE. DO YOU HAVE A LEAD COUNSEL IN IN IN ON THAT. THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A COUPLE TIMES AND ANALYSES MAYBE DISCUSSION JUDICIARY BUT I WOULD LIKE A IT WAS A RECORD HERE IT WAS ADDRESSED BY THE ANALYSIS IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I'M THE THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOWED TO BOTH CREATE AND EXTINGUISH CAUSES OF ACTION AND SO THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS PROBLEM WITH THE LEGISLATURE EXTINGUISHING ACOSTA ACTION IN THIS CASE. IN DOUBTS FROM OUR LEAD COUNSEL. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS I I'VE. BEEN. THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS KEEPS COMING OVER I'M SO. OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WHEN WE I KNOW WHEN WE CALL FOR A VOTE THIS. IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. TO KEEP ITS COLOR. ITEM NUMBER SIX A. B. TWO OH SIX MOTION IS DO PASS. HI ALLEN I I TELL. SKINNER AYE STERN. DOLLY BUT ONLY I AM WIECKOWSKI. SB I'VE OKAY. WE'VE HAD OPENED TO ADMIT THAT MEMBERS ON SO WE'D LIKE THANK YOU CENTERS SO MEMBER RUBIO PLEASE -- COME FORWARD IN A PASSED THE GAVEL TO THE RESTAURANT [INAUDIBLE] YEAH OKAY. JEAN FIFTEEN ITEMS. WELCOME AGAIN THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. TEN NINETY THREE WHICH WOULD HAVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD DEVELOP FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS. ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES TO BETTER ASSIST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHEN DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOPING STORM WATER PERMITS. UNDER EXISTING FEDERAL LAW THE CLEAN WATER ACT OR THE CW A REGULATES DISCHARGES OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE WATERS. OF THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATES QUALITY STANDARDS FOR SURFACE WATER -- SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM PERMITS OR MS FOR PERMITS ARE A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE C. W. A. FOR PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE DEVELOPING THEIR STORMWATER POLLUTANT SCHEDULES MANY REMAINING NEED OF GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP ADEQUATE CONSISTENT AND COST AND FORM PERMITS. LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR THERE IS NO INTENT TO LESSEN THE CLEAN WATER ACT REQUIREMENTS WITH THIS BILL. BUT RATHER HAVE THE STATE WATER. BOARD DEVELOP GUIDELINES THE CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT PENALTIES FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING WITH THIS CURRENT SYSTEM. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE FOR ELLIE COUNTY ALONE EXIT EXCEEDS TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA'S OWN STATE AUDITOR CONFIRMED IN HER MARCH. ONE TWENTY FOURTH THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED THE COST OF LOOK TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THAT ARE THEY WOULD ENCOURAGE AND COMPLY WITH THE CLEAN WATER ACT. THE AUDITOR ALSO SITE STATE LAW REQUIRING REGIONAL WATER BOARDS INCLUDING TO INCLUDE ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS AS A FACT. DOUBLES YOU REQUIREMENTS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA DECLARED STORM WATER. AS THE STATE'S. FISCAL OR FAN DUE TO THE NEED FOR MORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN JURISDICTIONS STRUGGLING TO COMPLY WITH THE PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS OF STORM WATER. THAT'S WHY I AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR AND AB TEN NINETY THREE THIS YEAR. THIS YEAR'S BILL HAS SIMPLY BEEN MODIFIED TO CHANGE THE DATE FROM JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN TO JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY BOTH BLASTERS MEASURE AND THIS YEAR'S MEASURES HAVE RECEIVED BY PARKINSON'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AB TEN NINETY THREE HAS OPPOSITION AND HAS RECEIVED ZERO VOTE NO VOTES THE SESSION. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT IT'S I HAVE A MAYOR PRO TEM JOHN -- COUPLE SHIA. OF THE CITY OF SIERRA MADRE AND PAUL HUMOR WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS IN SUPPORT. YES GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M JOHN COMPOSURE. AND I REPRESENT THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AS A SPONSOR OF AB. TEN NINETY THREE THE BILL WOULD DIRECT THE STATE WATER BOARD IS HE ADMINISTRATOR OF STORM WATER PERMITS IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. TO DEVELOP IN RELEASED FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES BY JULY. TWENTY MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY THE USEPA OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. THE STATE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A THOROUGH UNIFORM AND MEASURED APPROACH FOR ASSESSING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF STORMWATER PERMIT COMPLIANCE. AB TEN NINETY THREE REQUIRES ONLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL BURDENS ON COMMUNITIES. OF CA GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO HELP ESTABLISH REASONABLE TIMELINES. FOR COMPLIANCE ALLOWING TIME TO SECURE GRANTS AND OTHER FUNDING FOR POLLUTANT REDUCTION PLANTS. AB TEN NINETY THREE DOES NOT ALTER OR WAVE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN ANY WAY. AB TEN NINETY THREE IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RECOMMENDED THE STATE WATER BOARD SHOULD EXIT SS EXISTING BECAUSE AND THE FINANCIAL ABILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY. BEFORE IMPOSING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THE ORDER AUDITOR NOTED THAT POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS CAN NOT IMPROVE WATER QUALITY. IF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THEM. COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS IS ESTIMATED THE COST AT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COUNTY. YEAH AND SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. THE US CONFERENCE OF MAYORS IS COMPLETED IN AFFORDABILITY ASSESSMENT OF MORE THAN THIRTY CALIFORNIA CITIES IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IN A THIRD OF THOSE CITIES 20% OR MORE HOUSEHOLDS EXCEEDED EPA'S THRESHOLD SPENDING. INDICATING AFFORDABILITY BURDEN PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AB TEN NINETY THREE WILL PROVIDE A RATIONAL AND UNIFORMITY IT FOR A VALUE WAITING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING WATER QUALITY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT SENATOR -- TODAY PRESENT TO YOU AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH ENSURES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS OFFICE RECEIVE NOTICE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS. PROP SIXTY FIVE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES A BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES CONSUMERS TO CHEMICALS. LISTED AS CARCINOGENS OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS TO TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROP SIXTY FIVE PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN ENFORCE THE STATUTE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. COMPLY THE CITIZENS MUST AND THEN SEND A NOTICE TO AN ALLEGED VIOLATOR AND TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ADVISING OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. PRIVATE ENFORCERS MUST ALSO REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN THEY FILE A COMPLAINT OR SETTLEMENT. THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE CLAIMS THAT ENSURED THAT PRIVATE ENFORCERS CLAIMS HAVE MERIT AND THAT PRIVATE LAWSUITS AND SETTLEMENTS ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THE PRIVATE ENFORCERS OR DEFENDANTS REPORT ANY OTHER PROP SIXTY FIVE ACTIVITIES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INCLUDING WHEN AN APPEALS FILED. AS A RESULT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MAYBE ON AWARE OF PENDING APPEALS AND THE COURT OF APPEALS ARE FREQUENTLY ASKED. TO OPINE ON THE LAW WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE TERM ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE RISKING A PRESIDENTIAL. DECISION DAMAGING THE AG'S AUTHORITY HE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE OFFERS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LITIGATION THAT COULD ESTABLISH STATEWIDE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF PROP. SIXTY FIVE IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE TO THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BE AWARE OF APPEALS REGARDING PROP. SIXTY FIVE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MONEY -- THERE BUT NOT THOUGH WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER MY NAME'S MARIO DE BERNARDO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SERRA WHO'S PLEASE. TO SPONSOR THIS BILL THIS BILL IS A A SIMPLE YET VERY HELPFUL MEASURE FOR OUR ATTORNEYS WHO WORK ON PROP SIXTY FIVE CASES. EXISTING ALREADY PROVIDES ALL SORTS OF NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR LITIGANTS AT THE TRIAL COURT LEVEL WHERE THEY NOTIFY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND IF APPROPRIATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CAN GET INVOLVED -- BUT THERE IS NO SUCH LAW OR REQUIREMENT FOR NOTICE FOR APPELLATE CASES AND SO. THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWO CASES RECENTLY WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE CASES ON OUR RADAR BECAUSE WE WEREN'T NOTIFIED OF THE APPEAL. AND NOT ALL -- PRIVATE ENFORCERS ARE THE THE BEST ATTORNEYS AND I MAY MISS REPRESENT THE LAWN THAT MAY LEAD TO A AN OUTCOME WHERE THE COURT ESTABLISHES PRESIDENT THAT COULD BE HARMFUL TO STATE INTEREST. ARE THERE AREAS OF THE LAW -- WE IN THOSE CASES HAVE FILED -- FOR PETITION -- TO DE PUBLISHED THE OPINIONS AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT WOULD MUCH RATHER DO THAT -- NOT DO THAT AT THE BACK AND BUT AT THE FRONT AND GET INVOLVED IF APPROPRIATE TO FILING AMICUS BRIEF AND HELP GUIDE THE LAW. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT NOTIFIES THE AG WHEN -- PROP SIXTY FIVE CASES ARE APPEALED THE VERY SIMILAR PROVISIONS IN STATUTE RELATED TO CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY LAWS UNFAIR COMPETITION SEE C&lt;U&gt;&amp;LT;C.CYAN&amp;GT; AND FALSE CLAIMS.&amp;LT;/C&amp;GT;&lt;/U&gt; SO THIS BASICALLY -- DOES WITH THOSE LAWS PROVIDE IN TERMS A NOTICE OF APPEAL.

AS WE KNOW OLD CALIFORNIA IS FACING ONE OF THEIR MOST CHALLENGING HOUSING CRISIS -- I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND SADLY.

IN JANUARY THE COUNTY CONDUCTED ITS HOMELESSNESS POINT IN TIME COUNT SHOWING AN INCREASE OF 42% IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION TO ALMOST. 700058% OF WHOM ARE AND SHELTERED. THE COUNTY HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OFEMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF CARE. INCREASING THAT NUMBER BY SEVENTEEN IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AB ONE FORTY THREE WOULD PERMIT THE COUNTY GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PROVISION OF SHELTER. WHILE REQUIRING THE COUNTY TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. BALANCING BOTH LOCAL AND STATE GOALS THEREFORE THE COUNTY URGES AN AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE FORTY THREE MISTER CHAIR SENATOR MONICA MILLER REPRESENTED THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA AND WE TO SUPPORT AB ONE FORTY THREE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS. BUILDING UPON A MEASURE THAT WENT THROUGH INTO 200-017-8930 TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PHIL TEEN -- IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM THEY WANT TO SEE IF IT WORKS I THINK ALL THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IT WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT WORKS WITH THE ALSO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ALL THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL BOX TO BE SUCCESSFUL. ON AS HE SOMEONE MENTIONED -- WE JUMPED UP 43% WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE POINT IN TIME COUNT IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT IT'S ONE DAY.

MEYER -- THE CEO OF THANK YOU A PEST MANAGEMENT COMPANY THANK YOU -- YES TRUE IT'S TOUGH FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIANS TO HEAR. THE RAPTOR OF THE ERA. YOU HAVE SUPPORT FROM TORONTO. THAT SAID GAME. WE WERE ALL CALIFORNIANS A MOMENT OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN ALAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY NAME IS LISA OWNS THE ANI AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IN TWENTY ELEVEN A NEIGHBOR CAME RUNNING TO MY HOUSE SECURING THE BODIES OF TWO YOUNG COOPER'S HAWKS. THEY HAD DROWNED IN HIS YOUNG SON SWIMMING POOL BLEEDING TO DEATH. HIS SON WAS TRAUMATIZED BY WITNESSING THIS AS WAS HE TESTS REVEALED THAT THE HAWKS HAVE BEEN POISONED AFTER EATING POISONED RESIDENTS. QUESTIONS FOUND IN THEIR LIVERS WERE SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT SO STRONG THEY ARE MARKETED AS ONE FEEDING KILLS. I QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT SECONDARY POISONING WAS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM AFFECTING ALL OF THE BENEFICIAL WILDLIFE THAT HELP US CONTROL RESIDENTS NATURALLY. OWLS HAWKS EAGLES BOXES MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AND MANY OTHERS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN DUE TO THE DANGER THESE PRODUCTS POSE TO NON TARGET WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION REMOVE THEM FROM CONSUMER SHELVES. WHATEVER SCIENTIFIC DATA COLLECTED SINCE THAT TIME SO THE PROBLEM HAS NOT IMPROVED. BECAUSETHE PEST CONTROL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO USE THESE PRODUCTS WIDELY. STUDIES SHOW THAT POISON RODENTS ARE PREFERENTIALLY PREYED UPON BECAUSE THEY'RE SIX SLUGGISH AND EASIER TO CATCH. RODENTS GO INTO POISON BAIT BOXES AND COME BACK OUT TOXIC TIME BOMBS FOR WILDLIFE. STUDIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY UC DAVIS U. C. L. A. AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT 70% OF NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS A THREATENED SPECIES. TESTED POSITIVE FOR ROB BASIN MORE THAN 85% OF CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AND PACIFIC FISHERS HAVE EXPOSED TO THESE DANGEROUS POISONS. THE PRESENCE DO NOT IMMEDIATELY KILL THESE ANIMALS THEY CAN HAVE SUB LEGAL IMPACTS INCLUDING AFFECTING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THIS MEANS THAT WILDLIFE ARE LESS ABLE TO FEND OFF TO SEE DISEASES LIKE MANGE. RIGHT PRISON HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED OUR ECOSYSTEMS IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OUR NEW DDT. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS A COMMON SENSE BILL TARGETED THE VERY WORST OF THESE POISONS DESPITE ISINFORMATION SPREAD BY THE PEST CONTROL INDUSTRY THIS BILL CONTAINS A CLEAR EXEMPTION. FOR USE DURING ANY TYPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR LORETTA MAYOR AND I'M THE CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER AND FOUNDER. OF SENESTE TACK OF PUBLIC BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON HUMANE ANIMAL POPULATION. MANAGEMENT MY BACKGROUND IS IN REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY IN ENDOCRINOLOGY I'M ALSO JOINED TODAY. WITH SCIENCE COLLEAGUES SPECIALIZING IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY POPULATION DYNAMICS AND RODENT FIELD BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOP DEPLOYMENT CONDITIONS. WRITING ROUTE POPULATIONS ON RHODEN DISEASES WITHOUT SCARS IS AN INHERENTLY LOSING BATTLE. AS CARS ARE LETHAL THEY SUSPEND THE COAGULATION SYSTEM WHERE THE VITAMIN K. PATHWAY. CAUSING ANIMALS TO BLEED OUT OVER DAYS MAKING THEM OFF BARGER CONTRACT PRAY. FURTHER THE LEAN THE HALF LIFE. OF THESE COMPOUNDS WHICH CAN BE MONTHS LEADS TO PERSISTENCE OF THE POISON WITHIN DEAD RATS IN THEIR PREDATORS. THE RESULTS RANGE FROM RAPID DEATH. WHICH MIGHT BE EXPERIENCED BY RAPTORS OR BIOACCUMULATION WITHIN THE PREDATOR. WHICH MIGHT BE EXPERIENCED BY MOUNTAIN LIONS AS WE'VE SEEN. PART. THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH FOR ASK OUR STRATEGIES IS THAT. YOU'LL NEVER KILL THE MALL. AND ALL THOSE THAT DO NOT DIE. OUR ASKAR RESISTANT. AND CAN BREED UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND PROGENY OR POPS. AIR PER YEAR. UTILITY CONTROLLERS OF CONTROL STRATEGY VALIDATED BY A CONSORTIUM OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES. AND IT WILL NOT LEAD TO DEAD INFECTED CARCASSES WILL NOT KILLED PREDATOR SPECIES ARE LEAD TO RESISTANCE. WHAT WILL TARGET THE ROOT PROBLEM AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM? IS REPRODUCTION. RATS THE CONSUME THESE PRODUCTS SUCH AS CARTER PASSED WHICH OUR COMPANY MAKES. STOP READING IMMEDIATELY AND POPULATIONS AND CONTINUED REDUCTIONS. WHICH CAN BE MANAGED BY MECHANICAL OR EXCLUSION PRACTICES. THE HALF LIFE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN THIS PRODUCT IS LESS THAN FOURTEEN MINUTES. AND IT'S CLEARED BY THE ANIMAL. THEREFORE IT DOES NOT BIOACCUMULATE. IT'S ALL YOUR FAVORITE THINGS SWEET SALT AND FAT. IN A NANO PARTICLE. THAT'S ATTRACTIVE AND HIGHLY PALATABLE IT'S ENGINEERED SO THAT THE A. I. CONCENTRATIONS ARE BELOW POINT 0009%. COUNTER PASSES REGISTERED BY THE EPA AND THE CALIFORNIA DPR. AND CAN BE USED AS DIRECTED TO CONTROL RODENTS AS PART OF ANY. INTEGRATED APPROACH OR AS A MAINTENANCE TOOL. WE HAD WE MUST. MUST ADVANCE BEYOND THE STRATEGIES OF THE PAST CENTURY. WE'VE BEEN KILLING THESE RATS FOR CENTURIES. AND WE MIGHT TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH BECAUSE IT IS JUST UNCONSCIONABLE TO ME. THAT THE AMERICAN EAGLE COULD BE CALM THE PROVERBIAL CANARY IN THE MINE. AND THE MINUS OUR PLANET. SO WITH THAT WE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. OKAY LET'S HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO ONE EXPRESS SUPPORT FROM ABOVE. RICHARD CHARTER THE OCEAN FOUNDATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

ANA TOMLINSON PROJECT HIGHER WOODY AND CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF WILDLIFE REHABILITATED AS IN STRONG SUPPORT RAT POISON KILLS MORE THAN RATS [INAUDIBLE] MR. I'M STEVEN SCHUSTER I'M GONNA LUCHAR BIOLOGISTS FROM NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY -- MY STUDIES INDICATE THAT -- TOXINS LIKE RAT POISONS STRONGLY LEAD TO THE EVOLUTION OF RESISTANCE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S A MAJOR ONGOING PROBLEM. THAT'S THE SIDES ARE CONSTANTLY. REQUIRED TO KEEP RED POPULATIONS AND CONTROL. FERTILITY CONTROL AS THE OFFICE THAT IS TO REDUCE BUCKLEY. SO I STRONGLY OR ALLOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT ON AND ON BEHALF OF THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THIS TALK TO FISH THANK YOU. OKAY WE HAVE A TWEENER HERE. GONZALEZ WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR RECOGNIZING OUR CONCERN AROUND. INVASIVE SPECIES ON FRAGILE ISLANDS -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SPECIFIC UNIQUE SITUATION FOR PLACES LIKE THE CHANNEL ISLANDS OR IN OUR CASE SANTA CRUZ-ISLANDS WHICH IS ACTUALLY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY -- WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED AS AN ANSWER JUST THANKING HIM AND WE'RE NOT CHAU. THANK YOU. HOPEFULLY THAT'LL BRING YOU ON THE SUPPORT. OKAY OKAY YOU HAVE ACCEPTED MEMBERS IS THAT RIGHT MISTER OTHER YES. OKAY. THANK YOU. OKAY I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO WANT TO REGISTER UP POSITION TO THE BILL. MAYBE WE CAN YEAH WE WE GIVE A MISSED ONE OF THE SEATS IN WHICH YEAH. GO TO THE CITY OKAY YOU COULD SAVE IT WILL HAVE. TO WHAT A GREAT YEAH YEAH. STATE. THIS WILL BE LIKE A OKAY I SEE HERE [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. YOU CAN GO FIRST ON YEAH OKAY -- ACTUALLY THANK YOU MISTER. MR MEMBERS I AM DOMINIC MARIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- AND THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE PUBLIC POLICY INTERESTS AT WORK HERE WITH THIS BILL. FIRST IS THE PUBLIC POLICY INTERESTS OF KEEPING RAT POISON AND OTHER POISONS OF THE WILDLIFE POPULATION. WHICH IS AN INTEREST THAT THE P. C. O. C. SHARES AND HAS CONSISTENTLY STATED. TO THE AUTHOR MISTER BLOOM IN THE MULTIPLE YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD A DIALOGUE ON THIS ISSUE GOING ON WITH HIM. THE SECOND POLICY ISSUE IS THE CONTROL OF COMMENSAL RODENTS STATED CALIFORNIA WHICH WE WOULD ARGUES A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES WELL. WITH A VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE SHOULD THAT NOT BE TREATED IN THE RIGHT MANNER IN THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN LOS ANGELES RAT OPERATIONS YOU EXPLODE. WHICH ISN'T GONNA GET BETTER WITH OF GLOBAL WARMING AND ELSE'S LEADS TO COOK COMMENSURATE DISEASES SUCH AS TYPHUS AND AND PLAGUE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THE THIRD PUBLIC INTEREST IS THE INTEREST OF THE REGULATORY APPARATUS THAT EXISTS ALREADY TO ADDRESS THESE MATTERS AND THE PAST CONTROL OFFERS A CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN REGULATED SINCE LATE THIRTIES THEY HAVE INVITED REGULATION IN THE PAST ARE NOT AFRAID OF REGULATION. AND THEY'VE NOT RUN FROM THIS ISSUE AND DENIED ITS EXISTENCE IN ACT WE HAVE HAD AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH MR BLOOM. OVER MANY YEARS OVER THIS ISSUE AND HAVE TRIED TO FIND SOME. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION -- TO THIS AND WE STILL THINK WE CAN. I WILL SAY THAT -- WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IS YOU KNOW? SOME OF IT IS QUITE VERY TRUE IN MAINE YES IF YOU ARE FINDING RAT POISON IN -- PLACES THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE BUT YOU WOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS ALSO A TALE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIVATE USE AND NON COMMERCIAL BUT THE RESIDENTIAL USE OF RAT POISON. THESE MATERIALS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET FOR SALE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND EASILY OBTAINED. SO THERE'S AN ILLEGAL -- CHANNEL OF MARKETING AND COMMERCE INTO THE STATE THAT DEFIES THE LINE THAT I THINK CONTRIBUTES A LOT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPOTTED DOWN PARTICULAR WE LOOK TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS THE TAURUS -- FOR THEIR USE OF MATERIALS THAT MIGHT NOT BE ON LABEL AND SO. WE FEEL THAT THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE. THESE MATERIALS AND A CONTROL STRATEGY THAT DOESN'T JUST LEAN ON ONLY RAT POISON LEANS ON SANITATION MEANS ON EXCLUSION AND LEANS ON FERTILITY CONTROL AS MENTIONED BY THE WOMAN TO MY DOCTOR. MY LEFT ARM AND I WOULD EVEN SAY THAT I TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT HER THE WEBSITE FOR HER COMPANY. AND THEY HAVE A AID SORT OF HIERARCHY OF OF CONTROL STRATEGIES AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT ALSO INCLUDES. RAT POISON RECRUITS CHEMICAL SO THEY DON'T LEAN SOLELY ON FERTILITY CONTROL IT IS PART OF A SUITE OF DIFFERENT TOOLS NECESSARY TO CONTROL RATS. AND WHAT MY CLIENTS ARE SAYING IS. SECOND GENERATION REGINA SIDES FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE ROUTE INTO AND UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT SUITE OF TOOLS THAT WE WOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE BECAUSE IS A SOPHISTICATED THING TO CONTROL RATS ESPECIALLY ON THE CAMPUSES LARGE AS YOU'D FIND IN SOME OF THE BIOTECH. OR ANY LARGE AREA IT DOESN'T INVOLVE A WE'RE JUST GONNA STICK BAIT BOXES OUT ALONG THE BUILDING IT INVOLVES IDENTIFYING. THE PRESENCE THE POPULATION THE LOCATION OF THE BOROUGHS EITHER LURING THOSE RATS AWAY FROM THE BURROUGHS AND AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED OR IF THEY'RE NEAR THE BUILDINGS ARE IN THE BUILDINGS. LORING ABOUT IN GETTING THEM OUT INTO THE OPEN SPACE WHERE THEY CAN BE MORE. APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED IT'S NOT A HAPHAZARD I'M GONNA THROW A BIG BOX DOWN AND OR AT LEAST IT SHOULDN'T BE INTENSELY IT'S NOT WITH. HOPE THAT POISON TAKES EFFECT AND YOU KNOW THE RATS STOCK SO THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO IRAQ IN COMMENSAL RODENT CONTROL THERE'S A LOT OF A AYE AYES SOPHISTICATION BELIEVE IT OR NOT. IT'S REQUIRED BECAUSE YES RESISTANCE IS AN ISSUE BUT YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMAL THAT IF YOU SEIZE. IT'S A BROTHER SISTER WALK INTO A BOX AND NOT COME OUT BECAUSE IS DEAD WELL ANGLE ON THE BOX OR IF IT'S BROTHER SISTER WALKS INTO THAT BOX AND GOES BACK TO THE BERLIN DIES. THEY'RE GONNA LIKE SENSITIZED -- TO WE SHOULDN'T GO INTO THOSE BOXES SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE. SMARTER THAN A RAT WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY I'M NOT A OF PEST CONTROL OPERATOR -- SO I MEAN IT'S JUST YOU JUST IT'S IT'S NOT IS SIMPLE AS LET'S GET RID OF THIS MATERIAL AND WILL FIND REPLACEMENTS FOR THE RATS. THERE WILL BE SOME DAY SOMETHING THAT WE MOVE BEYOND THEN THE S. CARS BUT WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS FOR THE TIME BEING LET US HAVE AN EMERGENCY USE PROVISION. NOT THE ONE IN THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HE OF THE RIVER WE'VE GOT RELYING OFFER FOR A DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE AS FOR OFF LABEL USE FOR INVASIVE SPECIES. AND MY FOR FOLKS HAVE TRIED IT AND THEY'VE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S JUST TOO CUMBERSOME. AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR WE HAVE PUT SOME PROPOSALS OUT THERE WE'VE EVEN PROPOSED TO CREATE A A FUNDING STREAM OUT OF THE INDUSTRY. FOR ENFORCEMENT -- AND APPARENTLY WE'VE HAD SOME CROSSED SIGNALS ALONG THE WAY WHERE THERE WAS SOME MISPERCEPTION OF WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO DO. AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT ON BEHALF OF THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS WE LIKE TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE GOING WITH THE AUTHOR. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO MAINTAIN THIS MATERIAL FOR USE IN VERY LIMITED AND CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES. AS TO BE DETERMINED BY THIS COMMITTEE THE NEXT COMMITTEE COMMITTEE AFTER THAT OR DPR WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION AS WELL SO I WOULD AND MY TESTIMONY THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON ALL OF IRAQ RIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION -- WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE CROSS SECTION OF THE BIOTECH MEDIC MEDITECH AND LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I TO INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE NOT ONLY IN THE TYPES OF MEDICINES THAT WE MANUFACTURE. AND RESEARCH BUT ALSO IN THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS OF OUR FACILITIES -- EVERYWHERE FROM URBAN AREAS AND SENATOR HILLS A STRICT -- GREATER LA OCEANSIDE FREMONT -- AND UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL FOR ONE PRIMARY REASON AND THAT REASON IS. FEDERAL DRUG DRUG ADMINISTRATION REQUIRES VERY STRINGENT. OF OUR FACILITIES -- PART OF THEIR INSPECTIONS REQUIRES A PEST CONTROL MANAGEMENT PLAN -- AN IBM PC IS DOMINIC REFERRED -- TO WE HAVE LIMITED TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO CONTROL RODENT POPULATIONS WITHIN FACILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE INCREDIBLY STERILE -- SOMETIMES THAT HAVE AIR PURIFICATION STANDARDS IN THE PARTS PER MILLION -- AND SO REMOVAL OF THE USE OF SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS IN. LIMITED USE TODAY ADMITTEDLY -- WOULD TAKE AWAY ROUGHLY FIVE OF THE TEN TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX TO COMBAT THESE ROADS. AND SO WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE SPONSORS FAIRLY EARLY -- IN THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE'VE ASKED FOR AN EXEMPTION TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD COVER MEDICAL WASTE GENERATORS AND WAR FACILITIES THAT ARE REGISTERED WITH THE FDA -- THE OTHER CHALLENGERS SOME OF THE INSPECTIONS THAT WE HAVE -- FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THE THE EUROPEAN UNION JAPAN THE JAPANESE EQUIPMENT AT THE AT THE OUR FACILITIES ARE INSPECTED. SOMETIMES TWICE EVERY MONTH SOMETIMES ONCE A MONTH SOMETIMES -- THESE INSPECTIONS ARE RANDOM -- AND IN MOST CASES PARTICULARLY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF VERY DELICATE -- MEDICINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INJECTED IN HUMAN BEINGS BIOLOGICS -- ONE SINGLE EVIDENCE OF RAT INFESTATION RODENT INFESTATION -- EITHER DROPPINGS HAIR -- WOULD BE CAUSE FOR THE FDA TO SHUT US DOWN. SHUTTING DOWN OF THE SILLY LIKE THAT IT TAILS ALL KINDS OF DOWNSTREAM ISSUES -- DELIVERY AND MANUFACTURE MEDICINES AND SO WE'RE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED NOT BECAUSE WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR THE USE OF SGA OURS -- BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE EXEMPTED SO THAT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS CALLED FOR AND DOM TOUCHED ON IT AND I THINK WE'VE. HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT. CONTROLLING ROAD POPULATIONS IS NOT EASY WE USE MULTIPLE TYPES MULTIPLE. WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. TOOLS. AND AGAIN TAKING AWAY HALF OF THOSE TOOLS BE VERY POP PROBLEMATIC FOR OUR MEMBER COMPANIES -- AND SO -- BARRING AN EXEMPTION FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES AND AS A REFRESHER THE DIVERSITY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP COVERS BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE START UPS -- IT'S A LUXURY IN A CURSE TO BE THAT DIVERSE SO OUR ABILITY TO FIND THAT EXEMPTION HAS BEEN CHALLENGING -- WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED A POINT WHERE WE ARE COMFORTABLE -- WITH AN EXEMPTION THAT SATISFIES OUR ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE AND WE APPRECIATE NOT ONLY. HE AND HIS STAFF COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS -- THE SPONSORS I THINK WE'VE ALL REALLY TRIED TO DEFINE THE PROBLEM THAT I'M. TRYING TO HOPEFULLY ARTICULATE FAIRLY CLEARLY IS -- THE DIVERSITY MAKES THAT CHALLENGING ONLY BECAUSE OUR CODE SECTIONS ARE VERY CLEAR -- IN CONCISE WAYS OF CAPS LADY ALL OF THAT SO -- AGAIN ORGAN ADVANCEMENT I WOULD REQUEST TO KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER FOLKS WHO WANNA REGISTERED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON COOKING OR SOMETHING HAVE TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE LARA NO AND HE JUST ON BEHALF OF WESTERN PLAN HEALTH ASSOCIATION AND RISE IN OPPOSITION. FIRST AND JUST LIKE WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL ALSO OPPOSED. DONNA CAP KHIMIK YOU CAN'T CAN'T ASSOCIATES ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSE. ELEONORA FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE STATE -- REPRESENTS ACT. BECAUSE EVERY. YEAH THAT'S WHAT THAT THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOE ACURA BEHALF OUR CLIENTS ENGINE TO OPPOSE [INAUDIBLE] CHRIS. TRAVIS OF ANI -- CLERK PRESS CONTROL. IN OPPOSITION. PARTY ZERO ACCORD PRESS CONTROL I RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PEST CONTROL TECHNICIAN I WORK IN THE FIELD EVERY DAY DOING THIS -- IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION IF WE REMOVE THESE TOOLS IT WOULD CAUSE A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK -- WE NEED THESE TOOLS EVERY DAY IN THE FIELD THANK YOU. I'M BOB YOUR B. C. E. I'M A VECTOR BIOLOGIST AND I AGREE WITH THEM. WE ALREADY HAVE A TYPHUS OUTBREAK IN LA. OWLS AND HAWKS ARE NOT PRAYING ON THESE BECAUSE THEY DON'T LONG THAT'S IT. I ALWAYS DO COME INTO THE CITY AND ATTACK PEOPLE WE'VE SEEN IT IN NEW JERSEY. THIS BAN ON THIS RODENTICIDE THAT HOUSE AN ANTIDOTE. IS THE WRONG THING. WE WOULD BE LEFT WITH THINGS WITH NO ANTIDOTE. AND THAT'S PLEASE. NOW ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY. THE ITEM IS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THOUGHTS -- ISSUE SINISTER [INAUDIBLE] DID YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OR NOT BUT NOT A VICE CHAIR PLEASE ALL RIGHT -- THANK YOU BRING IN A BILL FORD BEEN AT THIS A LONG TIME. I'M. I'M A LITTLE TROUBLED BY HEARING BY SOME OF THE CONCERNS I'VE HEARD BECAUSE THE BILL. IN PRESENT FORM. DOES SEEM TO MAKE SOME ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THE KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT YOU MAY HAVE I'M HEARING THAT YOU'RE SAYING. IF PRESENT WORKABLE. THE FACT IS WE'RE GONNA EXTINCT. A BUNCH OF POPULATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHO. WHO WHO WANTS THAT VOTE TO BE ON THEIR HANDS -- WE LOST P. FORTY SEVEN P. TWENTY TWO WE ALMOST LOS P. FORTY FIVE GOT HE WITH MANGE TEMAS SURVIVING A WILDFIRE JUST TO GET HIT WITH RAT POISON AND DIE. SO WE SOME STARK CHOICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I A WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU KNOW. THIS THE THE THE CHATTER AROUND -- NOT BEING ABLE TO DO YOUR WORK ADEQUATELY FOR THE SENSITIVE FACILITIES. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA COME OUT YET FROM LICENSES INDUSTRY THAT SAYS YOU SAID HALF TAKING HALF OF OUR TOOLS AWAY MINERS IS YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY USING THESE TOOLS VERY OFTEN AT ALL. I TALK TO ENGINE IS BASED IN MY DISTRICT -- ONE BIG STAR IN THE FACILITIES IN THE STATE -- THEY'RE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB WITHOUT THE USE THESE ARE DENNIS -- SO I JUST I NEED. THE THE ROOM THE ROOM OR PART OF IT. IS IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE WE CAN ALL TALK ABOUT TYPHUS AND OUTBREAKS -- I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT -- MAN IS IS AS YOU POINTED OUT YOURSELF. I WE DON'T REALLY EVEN HAVE A REFINED APPROACH SO WE OPEN THE DOOR WIDE OPEN AND SAY JUST ANYBODY WHO'S REGULATED BY THE FDA IT SEEMS. DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA END UP DOING IS THEM PUTTING THESE IMPORTANT LIFE SCIENCES FACILITIES WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THIS COMMUNITY WE DON'T CARE IF WE GO KILL OFF A BUNCH WILDLIFE FRIEND ARE PLEASE BECAUSE WE'RE SPECIAL. AND WE'RE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS TO JUST ACCEPT THAT -- I CAN'T SWALLOW THAT PILL - AND WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL AS PARTNERS AND WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC VALUE BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A MORE REFINED APPROACH -- I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING HARD ON IT AND I THINK. I'VE I'VE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR. VERY OPEN TO WHATEVER KIND OF TAILORED SOLUTIONS. I THINK YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER IN -- GETTING HIS BILL IN SHAPE -- AND I'M AFRAID THAT IF WE KNOW MOVE THIS LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. AND IF WE KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. THAT WE ARE GOING TO EXTINCT. OUR CRITICAL POPULATIONS. OF COOPER HAWKES START THERE BUT WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. IF WE EXPECT NOT LINES ON OUR WATCH. SHAME ON US SO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND APPRECIATE. SOME CASKEY SO. MAYBE I'LL SWALLOW THAT PILL I CAME IN LATE BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET SO I'M NOT IT'S NOT CLEAR MY MIND WHERE THE AUTHOR IS ON THIS. BIOTECH. OUR CONCERN IS HER NO LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING AMENDED TODAY OR WE DO NOT HAVE LANGUAGE TODAY WERE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WERE WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT -- THE THE CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE -- WE WANT AS NARROWLY -- CAFTED OF LANGUAGES AS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE JUST NOT THERE AT THIS POINT. IS WITH THE WORD WILL THIS BE SIMILAR TO THE EXEMPTION LANGUAGE FOR WINERIES AND BREWERIES THAT WE HAVE. I COULDN'T SAY. I MEAN I KNOW WE HAVE THOSE EXEMPTIONS THAT EXCESS SO I I JUST. YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG DEAL MY DISTRICT SO I HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW. BY THE BY THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY SIDE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BALANCE THAT WE ADDRESS ON IT -- ALL RIGHT SO. YOU KNOW. WE'RE WE'RE INTENDING -- TO TO GET THERE BUT I THINK BIOTECH IS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM -- FROM THE WINERY INDUSTRY. AND SO WE WANT TO KEEP OUR LANGUAGE AS NARROWLY FOCUSED AS POSSIBLE. I SENSE SKINNER. I JUST WANT TO SEE VERY RULING STAND. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE LANGUAGE NERO. BUT YOU ARE WORKING WITH. COME UP WITH SOMETHING. WHERE WE ARE? MAC IN THIS BILL WOULD GO NEXT TO APPROACH. NO THE NATURAL SOURCES -- NOW TO RESEARCH SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE% ABILITY TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND POTENTIALLY AN AMENDMENT THERE. YES THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE OBGYN WERE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL -- WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON REACHING. I TRYING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT TO THAT BUT THE FACT. THIS IS A BALL IT'S BEEN KNOWN AS A CENTER STERN -- I REFLECTED UPON. THIS IS SOMETHING HAS GONE BACK AND FORTH FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW WE HAVE MEANT. TO REACH THAT POINT -- BUT IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF EFFORT AS AN ENGAGED IN THAT. LIST -- AN HONEST DIALOGUE THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT -- FOR FOR A WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC. HEALTH EXEMPTION. IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER HER THE OF CONCERNS OF THE INDUSTRY WAY MAINTAIN THAT IT IS. BUT TOM WERE HAPPY TO MAINTAIN. OF THE DIALOGUE BATON GOING AFTER WERE -- IF WE NEED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WILL CERTAINLY TRY AND FIND THAT LANGUAGE. I'M I APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS. HEARING BILLS THAT SOMETIMES HAVE A LOT OF OPPOSITION MYSELF. AND WE'RE AND I WORK VERY HARD. WITH. YEAH IS THAT. YOUR IMPACT BY BILLS BY. AND I CAN'T ALWAYS GET. OFF OPPOSITION. SOMETIMES I CAN GET THEM TO NEUTRAL BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADD YOUR COMMITMENT. TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION TO SEE IF THERE WAS A SWEET SPOT THAT COULD BE LANDED ON WITH THE LIFE SCIENCES BY. THE ANSWER IS EMPHATICALLY YES. I HAVE. TO TELL ME I'M I IN SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I'M EVEN WILLING TO MOVE IT. AND I THE THE DIFFICULTY IS WE FROM TESTIMONY BOTH BY THE EXPERTS AT THE TABLE IN BY THE OTHER FOLKS WHO CAME TO THE MIKE IS THAT [INAUDIBLE] THIS -- LIKE A NUMBER OF EITHER PESTICIDES OR TO SAY CHEMICALS USED TO DEAL WITH A PROBLEMATIC AS SPECIES. THEY'RE NOT SPECIFIC. AND IN I LIVE IN A VERY URBAN NEAR BERKELEY. AND THEIR OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALONE IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. COUPLE BLOCKS FOR ME THERE WAS -- OVER A COUPLE YEARS IN THE SAME THREE I COOPER SOCK YES NOW IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT WAS THE SAME COOPER STOCK. BUT THERE WAS -- AGAIN OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS IN THIS SAME TREE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD COOPER STOCK NOW. AND THEN ABOUT -- FIVE YEARS AGO. THE ALL OF THE FLEDGLING FLEDGLINGS OF THAT COOPER SOCK AND THE MOTHER. WERE FOUND DEAD WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE NEST. AND THEY WERE ALL FOUND. DEAD. YOU'RE EITHER A WADING POOL. SOME SOURCE OF WATER BECAUSE OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. THE BIRDS WILL EAT THIS -- ROAD SIDE IS THAT THE THE SO THIRSTY AND DATE BUT THEY CAN'T OF COURSE SATISFY THE THIRST IN THE SO THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THERE WAS ANOTHER COOPER SOCK NEST AND ONCE AGAIN. THE ENTIRE -- AGAIN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MAIL BUT THE THE MOTHER OF AN OFF PLEDGE LINKS. IT WAS ALL THE RAGE. AT THAT POINT THE CITY OF BERKELEY BEGAN TO PUT OUT A AYE NEWS BULLETIN TO THE NEIGHBORS BASICALLY. INDICATING THAT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK TWICE. BEFORE YOU USE THESE FOR NET. BECAUSE OF THIS IMPACT IMPACTING -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY'RE GREAT HORNED OWLS NESTS IN BERKELEY AND PARNELL NOW AND IT BEGAN TO IMPACT OTHER SPECIES OF BIRDS SO WHILE THE CITY OF BERKELEY AND DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTION TO -- MANDATE THEY BEGAN TO ALERT NEIGHBORHOODS AND -- ALERT IN THERE IN THE BULLETIN THEY SEND OUT TO ALL OF US IS RESIDENTS LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE STOP USING IT OF MY MATCH AND SOME OTHERS NOT NOW MY OWN HOUSE -- LAST YEAR HAD WRESTLING AT NO LIKE MOST LEGISLATORS ON HERE MOST THE MOST THE DAYS THE WEEK I'M HERE AND MOST NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST -- PAST OPERATORS THEY DON'T COME ON THE WEEKEND SO IT'S MY HUSBAND THAT HAD TO CALL TO DEAL WITH THE RATS AND I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY TIME TO INTERACT WITH THEM AND SAY MAKE SURE THEY DON'T USE THOSE ANYWAY HE THIS CALL THE -- TEST OPERATOR PASSED OPERATOR GAME BUT IN FACT DIDN'T EVEN ASK MY HUSBAND WHETHER HE WANTED THE RODENTICIDE USE ARE NOT USED BUT BUT IN TRAPS SEALED THE PLACE FOR THE RATS WERE COMING IN BUT IRONICALLY WHILE WE ALL IN OUR RAP THE RAP FROM WITH ELIMINATED WELL MY HUSBAND ALL THE BEST OPERATOR TO DEAL WITH AND THE OPERATOR DID NOT USE THE RODENTICIDE EVEN THOUGH MY HUSBAND DIDN'T DIRECT STOP THERE SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT A LOT OF YEAH ALL AROUND YOUR PROPERTY AND IN YES WHICH WE DO WE LIVE IN A THREE MY HUSBAND DIDN'T TEXT ME OR ANYTHING IN THE BY ASKING WE WANT YOU TO SPRAY FOR THE SERVICE RATE OR YEAH BUT HE DIDN'T USE ANY TYPE OF POISON OR THEIR OUT OF TOWN VERY FASCINATING ANYWAY -- I JUST INSTEAD IS THAT LIKE SO MANY THINGS THE RODENTICIDE NOT JUST KILL THE ROAD SO I SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE MET MEANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- LIFE SCIENCE INDUSTRY TRY TO SWEET SPOT AND I'M WITH IT WITH THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE CAN'T LET THIS CONTINUE -- AND IN LIVE WITH THE EFFECTS OF THAT BUT BUT I AM IN AND CERTAINLY I'M GOING TO JOIN THE CHORUS OF THE INDUSTRY AND AND THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT CERTAINLY IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FILE LIKE SCIENCES INDUSTRIES I I GUESS WHAT I'M YOU'RE USUALLY ONE OF THE TIME A BILL GETS TO THE SECOND HOUSE SENATE'S WORKING THROUGH WE GET REALLY CLOSE TO SOMETHING IN AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE WE'RE HEARING HERE AND THAT WE WILL SEE A SOLUTION TO THAT IN AND DAY THE ABILITY TO TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND -- I I THINK FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THERE IS THAT COMMITMENT BUT AT THE I THINK WE HAVE TO GET THERE AND BACK I I'VE I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS A STRONG NGOR COMMITMENT THAT THERE WILL BE A SOLUTION THE HONDA AN EMPHATIC YES AND IN FACT THIS IS GETTING THERE THAT'S GOOD WHICH I APPRECIATED I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE CONCERN I THINK WE HAVE WE DON'T WANT TO YEAH YOU KNOW SOLVE ONE PROBLEM CREATE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY IN AN INDUSTRY THAT'S SO CRITICAL TO TO OUR OUR LIFE BASICALLY AND THE AND OUR NEXT GENERATION SO -- OF TO BE SUPPORTING THAT IN LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SOLUTION AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU MEMBERS I SO SHARED YOU KNOW HELLO EXPERIENCE MAY I ACTUALLY HAVE A HER RECITE APPLICATORS BUT IT IN MY POCKET I I USE IT FOR OUR PART AND M. EDUCATED BY EVERY OTHER YEAR I HAVE TO GO DO CONTINUING EDUCATION I I I HAVE THE SAME ONE THAT THE GUY THAT HAS A CLARK STICKER ON IS I I USE THE SAME STUFF SO I'VE BEEN ON THAT END OF IT I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT WE'VE SEEN UP TICK IN ROAD INTO SIDES BY SINCE WE'VE -- LEGALIZE MARIJUANA WE HAVE A LOT OF GROWTH OF MARIJUANA NOT ONLY IN THE ROLE AREAS WHERE WE'VE REALLY SEEN A LOT OF USE OF PESTICIDES HERBICIDES ILLEGALLY DONE NOT BY SOMEBODY WHO'S LICENSED OR JUST THEY WANT TO KILL THESE ROADS TO REALLY LIKE THEIR PLANTS AND -- IT'S ALSO IN THE IN THE URBAN AREAS YOU'D BE SURPRISED OF PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW GROWING SIX PLANTS IN THE BACKYARD AND HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PASSED COMING IN AND SO THAT THAT'S IMPACTING THE WILDLIFE AS WELL SO WE WE REALLY HAVE SOME TOUGH CHALLENGES HERE AND THERE'S NOBODY I BELIEVE THAT WANTS TO SEE THE YOU KNOW THE THE MOUNTAIN LION EXTINCT BUT I I WANT ALSO SHARE WITH YOU SO THEN IT'S BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING ME IS THAT WE BURN OF A MILLION AND A HALF ACRES LAST YEAR SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES A SQUARE MILE SO DO THE MATH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF LAND DESTROY AND THERE'S A LOT OF WILDLIFE AND THEY'RE A LOT WHILE AT THE CAN GET AWAY DOZEN WHICH DIRECTION TO GO AND THESE FIRES RESPONDING AND AND I AT THE PRESSURES FOR ME AS WE I THINK WE WERE I MEAN I KNOW THAT IT'S GERMANE TO YOUR BACKYARD IN JOSHUA TREE I'VE I'VE I'VE SAT THROUGH THE HEARINGS ON THE SIDE BUT IN THIS JOB I'M I GET REALLY FRUSTRATED THE FACT THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE LOW HANGING FRUIT OUT THERE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO TO GET THE JOB DONE AND MAYBE SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION BECAUSE I DID A BILL THIS YEAR TO QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF WILDLIFE AND HABITAT WE'VE LOST DUE TO CAUGHT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES NOT ONLY ON PRIVATE LANDS BUT FEDERAL LANDS AS WELL AND IT GOT HUNG UP IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND DIDN'T GET OUT THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO STUDY THAT AND I REALLY APPROPRIATIONS AND AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW THAT NUMBER I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WORKS SO WE CAN FOCUS ON THERE IS THAT WE'RE REALLY DESTROYING WILDLIFE AND HABITAT AND AND OUR WATER COLLEGES AND THEN WE CAN HAVE AN ARGUMENT WE CAN HAVE WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE EDUCATED DEBATE SO -- ON THIS ONE I I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE DRIVEN IT'S YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE YOU SEE THAT WHAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT AND I AND I COMMEND THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO I WORKED WITH CLOSELY ON AND HE'S BEAT ME EVERY TIME AND AND ON MOST OF THESE BILLS -- BUT WE REALLY NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT THEY'RE USING THESE IT WE DO NEED THESE TOOLS THESE TOOLS IN OUR CULTURE THESE TOOLS TO I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE BUBONIC PLAGUE OUTBREAK IN YOUR CHANGER YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS AND WE START SEEING LIVES LOST HUMAN LIFE AND SO I JUST CAUTION THAT -- WE NEED TO REALLY NOW THIS DOWN AND I I KNOW THE AUTHOR PERSONALLY IS IS COMMITTED YOU THAT AND VOTED NO AGAINST IT IN IN NAM THE ASSEMBLY I'M A LAYOFF TODAY JUST TO SEE HOW YOU DOING THAT I KNOW IT'S GONNA GET OUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THOSE THOUGHTS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION WITH I I CARE ABOUT THE MOMENT YOUR OTHER WHILE AT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT YOU CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I WILL SAY I MEAN THE CASE OF THE DIVINE PLAGUE OUTBREAK THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH OPTION HERE THAT COULD BE RESERVE PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPT CORRECT -- AND THERE'S ALSO AN AG THE -- EXEMPTION -- THAT'S -- THAT'S BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND -- BUT IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR JUST VERY BRIEFLY STRONGLY WITH THE SENATOR'S POINT BECAUSE SAID MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRE AS WELL -- MOST RECENTLY WITH THE WORLD'S A FIRE IN THE AREA OF BURNS FREQUENTLY BUT WERE AFFECTED BY BOTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG URBAN INTERFACE TO A -- A WILDLIFE AREA THAT IS VERY DRAINED -- I THINK WE ALL READ STORIES ABOUT TO THE -- -- WILDLIFE AND -- OUTLINES AND AFFECTED BY THIS SO THERE'S A VERY -- I THINK STRONG INCLINATION BY ME AND OTHERS TO EXPLORE BOTH OF THOSE PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THEY ARE DISTINCT PROBLEMS BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY RIGHT TO UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH FIRE IS AFFECTING WILDLIFE IN THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD MUCH BETTER THANK YOU COULD EVER KNEW WE'D BE ON THESE COMMITTEES WHERE WE HAVE OUR MIND STRETCH IN OUR HEART EIGHTEEN A I NEITHER EITHER SIDE BECAUSE -- WHEN I THINK MANY OF US SAW THAT JOB HE TWENTY TWO RIGHT PAGE ARTICLE ON WAS KILLED AND ALL OF THAT REALLY TAKES A TOLL ON I THINK OUR WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE HAVE ONE ON BOTH SIDES SO I'D LIKE GASTON MISTER ASKED ON IT THE DOLLAR YOU SUGGESTED THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE A FEW MORE -- EXEMPTIONS AND I'D LIKE YOU TO ELABORATE BECAUSE WHAT I'M GONNA DO A LAYOFF I PROBABLY LINO ON IT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S CRITICAL ARE THAT A BETTER BALANCE CAN BE ACHIEVED -- AND THAT WILL BE A DIFFICULT NO VOTE FOR ME IF I WERE TO TAKE THAT BECAUSE OF MY DE TURN IN AND CARE ABOUT ANIMALS NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE AND THE EXTINCTION BUT OUR LOCAL ANIMALS AND I'VE HAD A FEW OF MY CAT TOYS AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT IT'S A PRETTY GRUESOME THING TO WATCH THEM GO THROUGH IT SO YOU HAVE THOSE ON OUT THERE IN THE WILD LANDS THAT ARE GOING TO THIS AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THAT AREA WHICH YOU KNOW WE DID WE LOST OUR OUT POISONING SO ON SHARE WITH ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON A LITTLE BROADER -- EXCEPTIONS THAT NEED TO BE THEY WERE TAKEN OR INVISION -- BECAUSE MISTER BLOOM ESTÁ AND I THINK AN INCREDIBLE JOB SO FAR -- CHEERING I THINK THE OCEAN PASSION THAT WE HAVE ON THE ONE SIDE AND TRYING TO BALANCE OUT WITH I THINK THE PREGNANT RIGHT NOW THE SIDE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC HEALTH YEAH I MEAN OTHERS SERVE BECAUSE THANK YOU SENATOR I MEAN IT DO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A CHRIS CHARISMATIC MEGA SPECIES HERE ABOUT MILES WHICH EVERYONE REALLY APPRECIATES AND ENJOYS PERFECTLY THEY SCARE ME TO DEATH -- ABOUT MOUNTAIN BIKER FOR -- BAKER AND THEY'RE JUST SPEAKING CATS IN THERE I LOVE HIM THE BEAUTIFUL BUT THERE WHEN ONE OF YOU ALONG WITH ONE SO YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION THING IN A WERE ALL SCRAMBLING FOR EXCEPTIONS RADIO EXAM THE EXAM EXAM THAT IS IT SEEMS LIKE IT IN OUR FULL TOOL IN THIS INSTANCE AND I THINK MY CLIENTS LOOK AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF WELL HOW DO WE LIMIT THE USE IT'S NOT THE EXCEPTION YOU KNOW LET'S EXEMPT THIS FACILITY HERE THIS ENVIRONMENT -- THAT ENVIRONMENT IT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF HOW DO WE LIMIT THE USE IN THE LIMIT THE BIO AVAILABILITY OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS TO WILDLIFE FOR THE ANIMALS THAT WILDLIFE AND THAT IS THROUGH A A IT'S A PROCESS RIGHT IN IT IN THE EARLIER I DID MY BEST TO DESCRIBE SORT OF HOW THE PROCESS OF EXCLUSION EXTERMINATION WORKS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE COLOSSAL RODENTS AWAY FROM THE BUILDING BY YOU KNOW LURING AWAY FOR BUILDING BEATING OUT PASSED THE BOROUGH YOU KNOW SORT OF CREATING FORAGE FOR THEM THAT IS AWAY FROM THE AREA THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT FROM THAT TO RODENTS AND SO IN THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST THE THE THE BAIT THAT'S A ESTAR BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES OTHER MATERIALS INVOLVES TRAPPING DETECTIVE PRESENCE NO NOT EVERY BIG BOX YOU LOOK AT HAS POISON IN IT AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S THE SYSTEM OF EXCLUSION AND AND CONTROL YOU KNOW IT ALSO INCLUDES YOU KNOW SO I THINK WE'LL I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS WHAT THE EXCEPTION SHOULD BE I LOOK AT IT FROM WHAT'S THE PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE USE TO ONLY THOSE INSTANCES OR TO THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THEY ARE NECESSARY TO KNOCK DOWN A GROWING POPULATION OR POPULATION IT IS GOT OUT OF CONTROL I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE POPULATION IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AT SOME POINTS HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL AND I WILL BET YOU A DOLLAR TO A DONNA THAT THE ONE OF THE METHODS ARE USED TO CONTROL THOSE MUSCLE RODENTS WAS PROBABLY A NASCAR OR SOME RAP WAYS THEY'RE DESIGNED TO KILL THE WORD WE'RE NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT THAT'S THAT'S THEIR MAIN PURPOSE -- AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO KNOCK USES MATERIALS TO KNOCK DOWN POPULATION SO THAT YOU CAN THEN DEPLOY THE OTHER LESLIE FOR LESS TOXIC NON CHEMICAL CONTROL AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS GIVE US THE TOOL LET US USE IT IN A VERY LIMITED SENSE LET'S LET'S AGREE ON WHAT THAT LIMITED SENSE IS AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW AND WE FEEL FOR A FAIRLY CONFIDENT GIVEN THAT AND ALSO LET'S NOT OVERLOOK THE ILLEGAL USE OF ASPECT OF THIS EITHER I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW AND ALLOWS US ONE MORE THING AND I'LL SHUT UP SQUARE WHICH IS -- WE HAVE AN AGENCY THAT IS TOTALLY DEDICATED TO THIS WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT ASIDE REGULATION THIS MATERIAL THIS CAR IS UNDER REEVALUATION PRESENTLY AT DPR IN THE THAT OUT AND AND OUTCOME OF THAT WILL BE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS AND NEW PRACTICES AND LICENSE CONDITIONS THAT WILL IN LARGE PART RESTRICT THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS SO THE THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I APOLOGIZE AND SO CAN I SAY SOMETHING NICE TO THIRTY SECONDS TO FALL FROM THIS POINT ON THE TOP OF SURPLUS FROM BOTH YOU BRIEFLY JUST FOLLOW UP WITH DOMINIC SAID WHEN WE EXAMINE THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW IS REALLY A QUESTION OF DOING GATES RETURNING GAUGE THE THE TARGET OF NON TARGET WILDLIFE YES OF THESE ABOUT MIND IS TRAGIC WE HAVE MEMBER COMPANIES IN THE ANIMAL MEDICINE AND A LOT OF OUR FACILITIES ARE CHOSEN TO VOLUNTARILY LIMIT THEIR USE OF SECOND GENERATION AT THAT POINT AND IF THEY CAN USE ALTERNATIVE METHODS THE CHALLENGE WE'VE HAD IS SENATOR STERN DISTRICT MEMBERS AND CENTER SCANNERS DISTRICT HAVE YOU BELIEVE NOT USE THESE WE ALSO HAVE SOME -- INCLUDING ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP FIVE MANUFACTURERS OF MEDICINE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MINUTES SOUTH OF HERE IT IS ADJACENT TO ONE OF THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL BURST IN THE WORLD THE BREWERY CAN USE THEM AND RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET OUR FACILITY COULD NOT TO WORK WE'RE GRAPPLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE RATIONALIZATION FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS WHILE LIMITING -- EXEMPTIONS FOR OUR GUYS A RULE FOLLOWER RIGHT I MEAN THAT THESE THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN VERY LIMITED USE VERY LIMITED APPLICATION STRICT REGULATION ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM THE BUILDING I MEAN THIS OUR GUYS FOLLOW THE RULES INCREDIBLY SORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTAL INGESTION OF THESE THINGS BY WILDLIFE PROBABLY NOT AND SORRY BEEN ON THE POINT THAT OUT THIS BILL DOESN'T GO AFTER THE ILLEGAL SALE IT DOESN'T GO AFTER THE LEGAL USE IT DOESN'T GO OUT LEGAL OVER USE AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY -- I'M NOT A BIOLOGIST BUT WE'RE EXEMPTING CERTAIN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PROBABLY FOR MORE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO WEAR THESE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS THAT'S KIND OF THE RUBBER OUR GUYS IS THEY KEEP COMING US AND SAYING WE GET IT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY A TOOL WHEN THAT VERY SAME TOOL IS ALLOWABLE IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE LESS OF A RISK IF THEY WERE TO HAVE AN INFESTATION WE CAN'T CLAIM THE PUBLIC EMERGENCY IS BY THE TIME IT GETS TO EMERGENCY WE'VE BEEN SHUT OUT WE'VE GOT OUR BIGGER PROFITS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE THE PLEADING ARGUMENT ON OUR END IS WE GET IT WE'RE THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL WE SUPPORT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT INTO ME TO CUT YOU OFF BUT I MEAN ARE BY TECH BROTHER IN ARE GOING TO DEVELOP HOPEFULLY ALTERNATIVES PLEASE BETTER WAYS OF DOING THIS HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE THIS PROBLEM OUT BUT RIGHT NOW TO DAY IT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX THAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH QUICKLY EFFECTIVELY AND IN A MANNER THAT WE CAN CONTROL ALRIGHT I THINK WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT TO EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND IT IS A QUESTION OF BALANCE WE MUST STRIKE A BALANCE I WORK VERY HARD IN MY INDUSTRY FOR I AM NOT A PEST MANAGER WE WORK FOR THE PAST MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY TO GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES WE ALSO INTRODUCE A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND IN STUDY I BEGAN IN THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY HOWEVER IT SCRIPTS RESEARCH IN LAHORE YEAH WE HAD VERY FEW RATS EVERYTHING WAS A CLEAN ROOM AND I THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO GATHER AND A SPECIAL LEE WITH THE LEADERSHIP YOUR -- WITH ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM WE WILL BE ABLE TO STRIKE IT WHAT HERE'S THE PAIN THAT WE ALL HAVE TO FACE FROM TIME TO TIME WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP IS THAT FIRST STEP GONNA COME FROM CALIFORNIA I GUARANTEE YOU IT'S NOT GONNA COME FROM OHIO AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND ANYONE THEIR ARMS SAYING IT IS LEADERSHIP IT IS A KNOWLEDGE BEING IT IS MOVING FORWARD AS A GROUP ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER AND WE'D BETTER TAKE THAT FIRST STEP WE HAVE BEEN ON THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE -- IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS WELL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO SEE THE RESULTS IN THE IMPACT I DON'T THINK SO I THINK WE'RE IN THE LEAD HERE OKAY SENATOR FAR WE HAVE BEEN THERE VINCE IS CITIES RIGHT AND DO WE KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE CITIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS ON THE RIGHT YEAH WELL YOU KNOW WE -- WE'VE WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THAT LA HAS -- IS IS AN EGG EXAMPLE THAT SHOULD BE HELD UP LA IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW IS AN EXCEPTION -- IT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE TODAY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS TAKING STEPS TO DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION WHICH MEANS CLEANING UP TRASH AND HAVING A NEW APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT -- AREAS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OUR FREE OF TRASH AND THAT IS IN EFFECT -- -- PROBLEM AND GOING AFTER IT AT ITS SOURCE -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DO TO CONTROL PASS BUT IF I IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR -- RESPOND VERY BRIEFLY TO SENATOR BATES WHO VERY CLEARLY ASKED FOR -- BE WOULD EXEMPT WHAT WHAT EXIT WITH AN EXEMPTION LOOK LIKE AND THE RESPONSE THAT CAME BACK WAS WHAT WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT LIMITING USE AND -- AS I WAS LISTENING TO THAT CONVERSATION WHAT I WAS HEARING AS WE'D LIKE TO IDENTIFY WHAT IN OUR INDUSTRY TO BE CONSIDERED BEST PRACTICES I TAKE IT AS A GIVEN THAT IN THE PAST CONTROL INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALREADY EMPLOYING THIS ISSUE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS SO I BELIEVE THEY'RE ALREADY EMPLOYING WHAT THEY BELIEVE OUR BEST PRACTICES BUT THE PROBLEM WE'VE IDENTIFIED HAS NOT GONE AWAY IT HAS EITHER MAINTAINED OR INCREASED AND ITS SEVERITY AND SO THE BEST PRACTICE THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW IS NOT WORKING FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY NOW WE HAVE IDENTIFIED EXCEPTIONS THAT WERE WILLING TO WORK ON WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT WE WILL -- WORK HARD ON THOSE TO ACHIEVE ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE I'M AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL DO THAT SURE IF I MAY JUST TO BE CLEAR AND IS A VERY BRIEF TO MR BLOOM'S POINT WE DID OFFER AS AN EXCEPTION TO MR BLOOM AS AN AMENDMENT AS A CONCEPT OF IN A MOMENT AND IT WAS REJECTED BY HIM AND THE -- PROPONENTS IN THAT EXCEPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN A FARM TO FORK WHAT WE CALL THE FARM TO FORK EXCEPTION WHICH IS ALL THE WAY FROM THE FARM TO A COMMERCIAL OR KITCHEN AREA WHERE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU EXCLUDING KEEPRITE TIMELY FOR HERE WAS A THAT WAS TOO BROAD YEAH I BELIEVE IT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO MY POINT WASN'T THAT I WANT A BROADER THING BECAUSE I WANNA TALK PROCESS MY POINT WAS THAT I WE HAVE OFFERED EXCEPTIONS THERE IS CONCERN AT EVERY EXCEPTIONAL LONG THE WAY YOU HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE ASKING FOR AN EXCEPTION THAT THEY COULD BE TOO BROAD AND WHAT I AM SUGGESTING IS IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO TIGHTEN IT DOWN NOT TO THE EXCEPTION WHICH I THINK IS AN ARTFUL BECAUSE IT COVERS LARGE SWATHS OF LAND BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS IN WHICH THESE MATERIALS ARE DEPLOYED AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY'RE DEPLOYED WHICH IS A RESPECTIVE OF LOCATION TYPE BUSINESS ALL RIGHT THAT WAS THE THE SPIRIT BEHIND WHAT I SAID IT WAS NOT TO FIND A BROADER EXCEPTION FOR THIS BILL TO WRITE RIGHT NOW -- IS ANYBODY WHAT ARE THE RULES AS TO WHO CAN ACTUALLY APPLY THE THURMOND DECIDES BEGINNING WITH ME LICENSE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS ONLY YOU CAN ONLY BE DONE BY WAS A TWENTY FOUR TRY AS A TWENTY FOURTEEN IS A HOMEOWNER I CAN'T BUY IT ONLINE SURELY I SHOULD BE ABLE TO I COULD I SHOULD BE ABLE TO YEAH -- -- SO BUT SO THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE KIND OF MODEL YEARS TALKING ABOUT AND YET WE STILL HAVE OUTLINES DYING SO IF WHAT'S GOING WRONG HERE I MEAN IF I GET I GET THAT ARGUMENT IF WE WERE STILL ALLOWING YOU TO BE OFF THE SHELF BUT AGAIN A LITTLE BIT BEYOND MY SCOPE FROM A MICROBIOLOGY STANDPOINT BUT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF AFTER THE COLLAPSE THE ON THAT MOUNTAIN LINE ARE FOUND WERE NOT OBTAINED LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA SOME OF THEM CAME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES I'M EARLY SOUTH OF US SOME OF COME FROM OTHER STATES WERE STILL LEGAL TO PURCHASE THESE THINGS THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON BY YET ANOTHER STATE DRIVING ACROSS AND ILLEGALLY USING IT OR OVER USING IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA SO I NO RESTRICTION ON THAT BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE COVERED IN THIS BILL NOW FOR SPENT AN ISSUE WAS BUT I THINK HE FOR SPECIFIC POSSESSION WOULD BE ILLEGAL NOW UNDER THIS BILL IT'S GOING OF COURSE WELL GOOD FOR IS ANY IN POSSESSION WOULD BE ILLEGAL UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY EXEMPTED AG WINERIES SAUDIS BUT I MEAN THAT IS THE IN GO BACK TO THE POINT I MADE EARLIER AND I'M GONNA GET DIVORCED HIS NAM SAID IT TWICE FROM ONE ANOTHER YOU'VE GOT A MAJOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY FOR DRUGS AND THEN ACROSS THE STREET A MAJOR BREWERY ONE IS EXEMPTED AND THE OTHER IS NOT -- THE THE THE MIGRATORY PATHWAYS OF THESE ANIMALS ARE THEY REALLY MAKING A U. TURN AFTER EATING THE GOOD STUFF HERE THE BAD STUFF HERE THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY CHASING ONE ANOTHER SO IF ONE IS USING LEGALLY EVEN AND CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS PROHIBITED FROM USING THERE IS THERE IS SOME FUNDAMENTAL SORT OF THERE'S SOME FRICTION THERE AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS NOTED THE ANALYSIS AGAIN PERSONAL TEN AND RESTRICTED USE ON THE ISLAND OF CATALINA PERFECT SENSE IS THAT'S AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ONE VERY SPECIFIC THING TO TO DOMINIC'S POINT LEVEL SO YEAH OKAY WHAT IT IN THE ATTIC WAS WORTH HAVING A FREE DISCUSSION ON THIS BECAUSE IT THE ISSUES ARE DIFFICULT I I WILL I WILL SAY I DO I'M VERY MUCH RESPECT THE AUTHOR NOT ONLY FOR HIS -- LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS I EVEN KEELED AND FAIR APPROACH TO -- TO TRYING TO COME UP WITH WITH SOME SOME REASONABLE POLICY SOLUTIONS AND SO I'M HE'S MADE THE COMMITMENT TO SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH -- SOME OF THE VOICES IN OPPOSITION TO SEE WHAT WHETHER WE CAN REALLY GET TO ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES HERE BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE GUARDS TO -- TO THESE POISONS IN THE IMPACT THEY'RE HAVING ON OUR ECOSYSTEM WRIT LARGE AND SO ON AND WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I'M I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND IT'S GONNA GO NATURAL RESOURCES HI AND THE BEFORE THE WORK ON THIS AND BUT BUT I I I WILL I WILL I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE IN IN IN HERE HAVING THIS OPEN ENDED DISCUSSION ABOUT A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES ASSOCIATE WITH THE SPELLING -- SO IT'S THE MOVE BY CENTER STERN I -- WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE OTHER NUMBER CENTERED SKINNER HE SAID IT THE OKAY WELL THEY CAN DO IT SOME MORE SIXTY FIVE FOR THAT BUT AT LEVEL OF OUR BESSEMER TO TO GET THEM TO TO TO CLOSE THAT YOU'RE THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS A GREAT FIGHT TO HEAR YEAH BUT WILL KEEP TALKING JERRY DOESN'T GET THEM THE MOTION TO OKAY I'M SORRY A SON OF A BETTER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BEFORE THIS GETS OUT YES OKAY THANK YOU PLEASE CALL TWENTY FOUR AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE ALLEN HI ALLEN I BATES HILL HILL AYE SKINNER I STERN STERN AYE BELLY I CASKEY OKAY THAT'S FORTY ZERO SO THAT HASN'T EFFORTS TO GET OUT I THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR PRESERVATION AND VERGE OF EVERY YEAR OKAY SO LET'S NOW GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THE ROLE ON THE VARIOUS ITEMS LET'S START WITH THE CONSENT CALENDAR CONSENT CALENDAR CONSISTS OF ITEMS NUMBER ONE ELEVEN TWELVE TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO SIX ZERO WELL LIKE OWSKI HI I OKAY THAT'S OUT SEVEN ZERO UNANIMOUS ALL RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT SO LET'S NOW GO TO ITEM TWO THIS IS A SOMERS COOPER'S BILLS WE HAVE YOU DOWN AS AN I.
