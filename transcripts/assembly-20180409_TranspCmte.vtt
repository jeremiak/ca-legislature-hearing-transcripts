HAVING TIME ENOUGH TO TRY TO

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:17.008 region:rollup2
PROBABILITY OF CAUSING ANOTHER

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.138 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DIG OUT OF IT.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.439 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO WE

ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:58.949 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO A VERY PRIVATE

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.983 region:rollup2

WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:35.051 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBERS.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:36.953 region:rollup2

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.589 region:rollup2
EIGHT I DON'T IF YOU LOOK AT

THAT OPTION AND IF NOT WHY

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.827 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT MORE FEASIBLE.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:46.496 region:rollup2
IF.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:48.164 region:rollup2

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:52.969 region:rollup2
EXISTING MECHANISM. WITHOUT AN

OPT IN IN THE INFORMATION ONLY

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:56.206 region:rollup2

POLICYMAKERS ARE COLLEGE USE IN

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:59.042 region:rollup2
THE AGGREGATE SO THERE'S NO

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.410 region:rollup2
PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:02.612 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS THROUGH THAT.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.713 region:rollup2
WE HAVE. THIS QUESTION CAME UP

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.448 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.950 region:rollup2
AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT PROCESS.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.551 region:rollup2
AND I THINK OUR ONLY CONCERN IS

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:10.387 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HOW THAT WOULD

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:11.688 region:rollup2
FUNCTION THROUGH THE TWO OFFICES

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:13.556 region:rollup2
RIGHT I MEAN I THINK WE WOULD

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:15.025 region:rollup2
HAVE TO STEP. GO BACK AND TALK

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
TO OUR SPECIFIC DATA FOLKS TO

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.927 region:rollup2
SEE. HOW THAT PROCESS WOULD

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.563 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE?

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:22.399 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT WOULD ENTAIL IF

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:23.633 region:rollup2
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE. WE DID A

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:25.035 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROCESS FOR THE STUDENT

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.169 region:rollup2

DISTRICTS TO STUDENT A

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:31.641 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SO WE CAN TRY AND GET

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.710 region:rollup2
THEM AS MUCH FINANCIAL AID IS

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:35.011 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE. BUT NOT PROCESS DID

INCLUDE AN OPT OUT FOR STUDENTS

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:37.013 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE THINKING MAYBE

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:40.083 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MODEL THERE THAT WE TO

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:41.084 region:rollup2
FOLLOW BUT WE JUST WEREN'T READY

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:43.019 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION TODAY.

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:44.587 region:rollup2
AND AND. I THINK YOU BECAUSE I

PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND SEE WHAT

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:58.702 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK ABOUT OTHERS AND

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.203 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN HELP. ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.371 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO CRITICAL EDUCATION

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:04.240 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY ANYTHING GOVERNMENT

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:05.075 region:rollup2
DOES I'M I I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.676 region:rollup2

PERPETUATING POOR USE OF FULL SO

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.619 region:rollup2
SECURITY NEVER THAT BART STATE

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.954 region:rollup2
HAS NO BUSINESS DOING THAT

ANYMORE?

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.390 region:rollup2
AND.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.758 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU GET DOWN THAT PATH YOU

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.460 region:rollup2
END UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:25.228 region:rollup2
WON'T CHANGE.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:30.233 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS DOING IT.

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:32.202 region:rollup2
AND WE END UP PATCHWAY IN A

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.903 region:rollup2

HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER.

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:36.773 region:rollup2
I'M NOT USING FULL SO SECURITY

FUTURE. THIS WILL BE A COMPLEX

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:39.368 region:rollup2
AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND NOT

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:40.936 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SOME CONTROVERSY. BUT IN

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:42.104 region:rollup2

THAT A TRANSITION NEEDS TO

OCCUR.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:50.179 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THIS IS COMPLEX AND

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:52.281 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BE

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.582 region:rollup2
PLANNED. THAT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:55.384 region:rollup2
WITH OUR INDUSTRY AND LABOR

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:56.852 region:rollup2

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:58.454 region:rollup2
WHEN WE INVEST STATE DOLLARS

WELL THOUGHT OUT IN STRATEGIC

01:21:01.657 --> 01:21:03.792 region:rollup2

PAID FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR POLL

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:13.736 region:rollup2

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:15.003 region:rollup2
SHIPPED. WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:16.472 region:rollup2

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:19.241 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:21.009 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR NOW WITH THE

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:23.512 region:rollup2
COMPETITION OF PORTS.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:25.013 region:rollup2
IN OTHER STATES OF THIS BECOMES

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:27.116 region:rollup2
REALLY BAD CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:28.717 region:rollup2
I AS YOU ARE AWARE CALIFORNIA'S

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:30.819 region:rollup2
PORTS ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.920 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:33.655 region:rollup2
AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.557 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WITH HEAVY INTEREST IN

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:37.259 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS. I'VE SEEN

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.761 region:rollup2
FIRST HAND INVESTMENT IN OUR

PORT GATEWAYS CAN SUPPORT AND

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.830 region:rollup2
GROW JOBS ALL ACROSS ALL OF OUR

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:42.631 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:45.000 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE VALUE OF

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:46.335 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.903 region:rollup2
THAT WERE EXPORTED TO THE PORT

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:50.639 region:rollup2
OF OAKLAND IN TWO THOUSAND

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN TOTAL OVER SIX POINT

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:54.109 region:rollup2
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. BUT AT

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:55.844 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME WE WE KNOW ALL TOO

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.246 region:rollup2
WELL THAT INCREASED TRADE

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:58.180 region:rollup2
BARRIERS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:00.249 region:rollup2
THIS CAN OCCUR AT THE

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:02.217 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL LIKE WE HAVE

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:04.520 region:rollup2
SEEN WITH TERRACE BEING ACTIVELY

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:06.221 region:rollup2
DEBATED IN BEIJING AND

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.055 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON DCSCENERY RIGHT NOW

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:09.057 region:rollup2

IMPACT OUR STATE'S FARMERS. AND

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:13.028 region:rollup2
AG COMMUNITIES INCREASES IN THE

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:16.865 region:rollup2
COST OF TRADE CAN ALSO OCCUR AT

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:17.1000 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL. AB THIRTY

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.667 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WILL HELP TO AVOID THIS.

01:22:17.1000 --> 01:22:20.402 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALL ANTICIPATE THAT WILL

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:22.271 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE MORE COSTLY PART

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:24.239 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ANY EQUIPMENT

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.541 region:rollup2
COSTS BUT WITH GOOD PLANNING AND

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:27.075 region:rollup2
LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WE CAN

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:28.410 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT OUR TRANSITION TO

THIS WAS THAT WE WOULD

01:36:15.637 --> 01:36:18.373 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY SEE THE REGULATED

A LOOK OF MORE AT SOME OF THE.

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:30.445 region:rollup2
METRICS AND THE DIFFERENCES

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:31.279 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE SMALLER AGENCIES IN

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:33.047 region:rollup2
THE LARGER AGENCIES AND HOW

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:34.716 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FUNDING SOURCES COME

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:37.985 region:rollup2
FROM AS WELL. AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:34.716 --> 01:37:40.621 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT OVERLY BROAD AND IN

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:41.823 region:rollup2
TERMS OF TRYING TO.

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:44.759 region:rollup2
TARGETING EVERYONE ONE MAYBE IT

01:37:41.823 --> 01:37:45.560 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TARGETING THE AGENCIES

01:37:44.759 --> 01:37:46.928 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY ARE UNABLE TO TURN.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:51.332 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:37:46.928 --> 01:37:53.334 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS.

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:54.869 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT.

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:55.737 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT SOMEBODY AGENCIES

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:58.506 region:rollup2
HAVE LOCAL.

01:37:55.737 --> 01:38:01.843 region:rollup2
REVENUES OTHERS DON'T.

01:37:58.506 --> 01:38:04.412 region:rollup2
.

01:38:01.843 --> 01:38:06.114 region:rollup2
THE FAREBOX RECOVERY.

01:38:04.412 --> 01:38:06.447 region:rollup2
AND DYNAMIC IN EACH AGENCY IS

01:38:06.114 --> 01:38:08.349 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND.

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:10.251 region:rollup2

YEARS AND IT'S SO. THERE

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:19.093 region:rollup2
PRESSURES TO RAISE THE FARE BOX.

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:21.229 region:rollup2
RECOVERY BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:22.697 region:rollup2

EXPENSES AND RIDERSHIP IS AN

01:38:22.697 --> 01:38:25.366 region:rollup2
ONGOING CHALLENGE TO ME THE REAL

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.267 region:rollup2
GOAL OF THESE TRANSIT AGENCIES

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:27.502 region:rollup2
