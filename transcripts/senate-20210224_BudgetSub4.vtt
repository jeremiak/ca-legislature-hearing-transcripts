ONE BUILDING THAT IS ALMOST

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:48.886
DONE. NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:50.521
THREE ON THE LIST ARE NOT

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.256
PLANNED TO BE DONE ACCORDING TO

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:53.590
OUR MEETING WITH DGS A COUPLE

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:54.925
WEEKS AGO THAT THEY WERE GONNA

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.127
BE USED TO SWING SPACE. NUMBER

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.396
FOUR IS THE EDB BUILDING AND

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:01.565
THE NUMBER FIVE IS THE ON ROUTE

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:04.001
BUILDING AND THE PROPOSAL IS TO

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:06.570
MOVE OUR EMPLOYEES IN TO THE

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:07.838
BONNER ST BUILDING WHICH IS THE

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:10.908
NUMBER THREE WORSE BUILDING. SO

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.142
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.377
CHARGERS OFFICE BEING THE

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.912
NUMBER FIVE WAS BUILDING WILL

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.213
BE INTO THE NUMBER THREE WORST

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.715
BUILDING. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:20.117
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO.

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:23.087
RENOVATE BUILDINGS NUMBER TWO

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:25.456
AND NUMBER THREE THEN. IS THIS

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:27.591
STUDY REALLY ACCURATE. AND THAT

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:30.461
WAS. MY CONCERN IS MOVING US

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:33.597
INTO A WORSE RATED BUILDING.

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:36.800
NUMBER FOUR EDT THEIR NUMBER

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:39.036
FOUR ON THE LIST PERHAPS. THE

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.271
GOVERNOR SHOULD RENOVATE THE

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:44.475
EDT BUILDING FIRST. GIVEN THE

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.043
SITUATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.645
NOW WITH. FURLOUGHS WITH

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.981
LAYOFFS. WITH DEFERRALS TO THE

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:53.517
SCHOOLS I SMALL BUSINESSES

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:55.619
SUFFERING IN THE STATE NOW IS

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.821
NOT A GOOD TIMING. IN MY

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.823
OPINION TO BE RENOVATING MY

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.657
STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE

00:46:00.724 --> 00:46:03.127
BUILDING I'VE ALSO HAD MEMBERS

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:04.728
IN THE STATE BUILDING FOR

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:07.064
THIRTY. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.699
THEY HAVE NOT EXPRESSED ANY

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:11.235
CONCERNS WITH ANY OF THE LIFE

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:13.303
OR SAFETY OR OTHER MEASURES-

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.839
THAT- THAT WERE. DISCUSSED

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:17.741
EARLIER SO I JUST THINK THE

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:20.410
TIMING IS REALLY BAD- YOU KNOW

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:22.579
PERHAPS WE CAN DISCUSS THIS IN

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.047
A COUPLE OF YEARS DOWN THE

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:27.417
ROAD. AGAIN MOVING US FROM THE

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:28.785
NUMBER FIVE WORST BUILDING TO

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.354
THE NUMBER THREE WORST

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:36.994
BUILDING. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE I'M

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.962
TO ME OR MY TEAM SO. THOSE ARE

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.531
MY CONCERN HERE TODAY. THANK

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:41.165
YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:42.032
TESTIMONY I'M GONNA SEE IF ANY

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:46.370
FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATE ROTH

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:47.905
OR NOT BUT PERHAPS NOT I'M SURE

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.206
SOMEBODY COULD ADDRESS THE

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:51.742
SEQUENCING OF THE- RENOVATION

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:54.011
PROJECTS FOR US BECAUSE I'M-

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.679
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:58.315
TREASURES- I REQUEST HERE IS

00:46:58.382 --> 00:46:59.950
AND I GUESS AT THE END IT IS

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:01.752
NOT LEAVE US ALONE FOR RIGHT

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.687
NOW AND GET TO US LATER AND- I

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.955
GUESS THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:08.992
THE- HVAC SYSTEM AND THE WATER

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:09.593
SYSTEM IN THE ELEVATORS DON'T

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.962
FAIL AND I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO.

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.530
ADDRESS A DIFFERENT TO.

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:14.698
SEQUENCING BUT ON THE BASE

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:18.101
QUESTION. RENOVATING BUILDING

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.670
NUMBER FIVE BEFORE WE RUN OF A

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:21.905
BUILDING NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:24.074
THREE OR THREE OR FOUR. I'D

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:24.641
LIKE FOR SOMEBODY TO ADDRESS

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:28.312
THAT. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:32.349
CENTER- SO JASON CAN AGAIN. D.

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.318
I THINK THE I AM BACK UP A

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.986
LITTLE BIT- TO GIVE SOME

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:39.122
CONTEXT SO YES. IN TWENTY

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.992
FIFTEEN DGS DID COMMISSION OUR

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:42.526
CALL TO STILL BE CONDITION

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.328
ASSESSMENTS. ASSEMBLY CONDITION

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:46.997
ASSESSMENTS ARE- A TIME HONORED

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:49.933
INDUSTRY METHODOLOGY ARE DOING

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.735
RELATIVELY RAPID AND

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:54.438
INEXPENSIVE REVIEWS- COMPARED

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:55.973
TO THE EAST ABOUT FULL BUILDING

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.741
INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY I WISH YOU

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:58.942
TAKE A LOT LONGER IN BEIN

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.645
CONSIDERABLY EXPENSIVE. AND

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:02.679
PROBLEMATIC WITH THE IN

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.581
OCCUPIED BUILDINGS SO SCA'S OUR

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:05.983
WAY OF GOING THROUGH ITS OWN

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.751
CATALOGING. ISSUES IN THE

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.586
BUILDING THEY DON'T CATALOG

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.655
EVERYTHING BECAUSE WE CAN'T-

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.357
AND IT'S MOSTLY A FINANCIAL

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.725
ANALYSIS THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.927
WHAT IMMEDIATE WORK NEEDS TO

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:17.494
HAPPEN TO KEEP THE BUILDING

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.930
OPERATIONAL- AND WHAT SORT OF

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.465
THINGS WOULD BE DONE IN OVER

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.000
TEN YEAR TIME FRAMES. AND AGAIN

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:23.433
TO KEEP THE BUILDING

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.102
OPERATIONAL OR AT LEAST IN THE

00:48:25.168 --> 00:48:26.737
MEDIUM TERM NOT REALLY LOOKING

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.238
AT A LONG LONG LONG TERM

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:30.173
PROPOSITION AND A COMPARING

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.509
THAT TO THE COST TO REPLACE THE

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:35.979
BUILDING- AND SO IN THAT SENSE-

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:37.614
WE DID DO A COMPREHENSIVE

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:39.316
REVIEW OF OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.984
AND BUILDINGS WERE RIGHT.

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.786
HOWEVER THAT STUDY WAS NEVER

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.655
INTENDED TO BE THE SOLE SOURCE

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:47.591
OF DATA FOR THE SOLE BASIS FOR

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:49.259
PRIORITIZATION OF RENOVATIONS.

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.494
WE HAVE BUILDINGS THAT ARE

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.196
PORTFOLIO- THAT WE HAVE HAD

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:55.065
INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES DONE.

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.034
FOR YEARS ON A GROUP BEING ONE

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.870
OF THEM- THERE ARE ALSO OTHER

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:00.837
CONSIDERATIONS LIKE THE

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:03.140
SEVERITY OF THE ISSUES AND SO-

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.809
WHILE BOTH BUILDINGS NFCA MIGHT

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:08.412
HAVE. HOUSES CEREALS YOU KNOW

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:09.913
IT'S MUCH MORE SEVERE IN THE

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.281
UNDER BUILDING- FIRE LIFE

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:13.350
SAFETY ISSUES ARE MORE SEVERE

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:14.985
AND THE ON THE BUILDING THAT

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:18.088
THAT- YOU ALSO PASTIKAN

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.823
CONSIDERATION THE HISTORICITY

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.391
OF BUILDINGS FALL UNDERSTANDS

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.492
OF THE AGE WHERE WOULD QUALIFY

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:32.836
THE STORK CERTAINLY- THE

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:33.337
HUNDRED BUILDING ALREADY

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:35.005
GETTING IS- SQUARE. FOOTAGE IS

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:37.474
THE OTHER BIG EAT- SEQUENCING

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:38.542
PLAN WILL DESIGN TO. CENTER

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:40.277
AROUND CONSULT. THE TO LET OUR

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:41.311
EFFICIENCY ASKING THE THESE

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:42.713
PROJECTS THEY'RE ALSO DESIGN.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:45.082
TO TRY TO MAKE MOVES- THE

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:45.916
TREASURER'S OFFICE. BECAUSE OF

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:48.618
THE- CAPITAL THE FALL. WE WOULD

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:51.388
LIKE TO A INTO. THE BUILDING-

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:53.357
BIKE IN THIS BY WE ONLY TEN

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:54.424
WILL BE MOVING AND THEN

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.059
RELOCATING BACK EVERYONE ELSE

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:58.662
IS MOVING ONCE- TO AVOID MOVE

00:49:58.729 --> 00:50:01.131
COST TO AVOID DISRUPTION- SO IT

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.232
WOULD BE EASY BUILDING FOR

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.634
EXAMPLE- THAT IS IN THE

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.436
SEQUENCING PLAN IT IS SLATED

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.538
LATER. THAN THE UNDER BUILDING

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.774
BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY IS IT'S NOT

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.976
AS- IF THE CALLS- IN THAT SEAT

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.644
IS LEFT IN THE LOWER RANKING

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:22.219
THAN. NOTHING. IS- BY- THE

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.820
SCHOOL FOOTAGE HERE AS A REAL

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:24.755
WORK WE HAVE TO SWEAR OUT YOU

00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:27.090
NEED THE RAGE. ARE AND ON THE

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.525
BACK IN WHICH AGAIN WERE TRY TO

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:30.861
AVOID A DOING. ED'S ACTION THE

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:32.996
TEN IN. RE RENOVATION WHICH IS

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.098
ALSO ON AGENDA I WOULD BE

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.567
COVERING NEXT- AND SO IT'S VERY

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.969
MUCH SOMETHING THAT RT HAD A TO

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:41.171
THE SEQUENCING PLAN. AND YOUR

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:45.008
QUESTIONS UNDER. WHAT WHAT I

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:45.675
THINK IT DOES CAN YOU BLOW THAT

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:48.445
DOWN TO ABOUT THREE SENTENCES.

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.447
THE BINDERS IN BUILDING RANKS

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:53.683
HIGHER IN THE SCA'S BUT IS NOT

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.752
IN BETTER SHAPE THAN UNDER

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:58.021
HONORING IS IN WORSE SHAPE. THE

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.389
SEQUENCING PLAN PRINCIPLES TAKE

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.925
INTO CONSIDERATION. MORE THAN

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:05.762
JUST THE FCA'S AND B. BUT

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.965
COMPLICATED MASS THAT WE DID A

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:09.766
COUPLE OF THE SEQUENCING

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:14.004
PLANNED- REALLY. HAS A BETTER

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.707
CANDIDATE. FOR EARLY RENOVATION

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:18.742
THE- AND ULTIMATELY BY

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:19.976
UNDERSTAND AND ASKING BE SLOW

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:22.412
HIGHER RANKINGS IN THE ABSENT-

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.848
WILL BE- SERVICE SPACE BECAUSE

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.716
CAMERA AND THE LONG TERM

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:27.851
DISPOSITION UNDER BUILDINGS ARE

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.853
STILL UP IN THE AIR WE MAY

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.987
ACTUALLY BRING THEM. IT'S

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:33.457
POSSIBLE WE SELDOM- I'M

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:34.991
ACTUALLY WHAT THEY WILL TURN TO

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:37.828
ADAPTIVE REUSE THE BEANS KRAUSE.

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:39.563
OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:41.198
THANK MANAGER. THINK THANK YOU

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:45.535
VERY MUCH- IT WHAT IS THE TIME

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:47.237
FRAME THAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.206
THE END REBUILDING WILL TAKE.

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.042
TO DO THE RENOVATION. GOOD

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.044
QUESTION- SO MOST THE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.346
RENOVATIONS I BELIEVE ARE IT'S

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:58.815
A ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF YEAR

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.183
TIME FRAME FOR THE ACTUAL

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.552
PHYSICAL WORK- I BELIEVE I WANT

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:05.288
TO SAY THIS WILL BE DONE IN

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:06.523
TWENTY FIVE WHEN YOU FACTOR IN

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.493
THE DESIGN WORK AS WELL- RIGHT

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.161
AROUND THAT TIME FRAME I SHOULD

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.029
SAY TO THE LONGER THESE GET

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:14.464
PUSHED OFF OF THE MARKET COSTS

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.766
GO UP. LAST YEAR THE PROJECT

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.268
COST FOR ONE THING THEY

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.537
ACTUALLY INCREASED ABOUT 7%

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.706
PLUS OR MINUS- PROGRESIVE CUT

00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:25.108
INTO THAT AND REFUSED IT- BUT

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:28.945
EVERY YEAR THE PROJECT. COSTS

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:29.613
WILL GO UP ROUGHLY 527% AND

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:34.885
THEN WHAT- WHAT LED TO THE 43%

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:37.988
INCREASES IN PRICE. YES SO

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:42.392
ORIGINALLY- THE PROJECT WAS.

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:45.862
THE TRIGGER MONETARY CHU IS THE

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:46.396
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RUNS IN

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:47.998
BUDGET EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:50.834
WISE- THE LOWER COST ESTIMATE

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:54.237
THAT WE HAD AND THEN- LAST YEAR

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.639
IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BEFORE

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.741
THE PROPOSAL WAS WITHDRAWN- V.

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.676
PROJECTS COSTS THAT YOU SEE

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.545
BEFORE YOU ARE ARE WHAT WAS

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.346
SHARED AND- AND SO THEY KNOW

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:04.481
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS AS WE

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.516
WERE DIGGING INTO THE PROJECTS-

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.051
A COUPLE THINGS OCCURRED ONE.

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.186
THE BUILDING CONDITION THE MORE

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.688
WE DUG AND THE MORE WE FOUND

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:12.722
THAT WAS PHYSICALLY WRONG THAT

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:15.358
WE NEED TO ADDRESS- BUT I THINK

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:17.527
IN FAIRNESS MORE FUNDAMENTALLY-

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.796
THE PROJECT COSTS THAT WE USE

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:25.402
TO BASE. THE INITIAL- IN

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:26.536
ADDITION GAS ON- WAS THE

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.171
LIBRARY RENDON WHICH DIRECTLY

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:29.873
THIS FROM THE BUILDING COUNTRY

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.310
BUILDINGS- WHEN WE DID OUR SITE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.912
DESIGNATIONS HONORING. UPDATED

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.180
BUT THE COST ESTIMATES AND SAW

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.048
THAT THEY WERE MARKEDLY

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:41.384
DIFFERENT THAN BLACK RECORDS-

00:53:41.451 --> 00:53:42.452
WE WANT ANY KIND OF DUG INTO

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.920
THAT PROJECT WHICH HAPPENED

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.356
ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS AGO- AND

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:47.891
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:49.059
WAS ACTUALLY A SIGNIFICANT

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.393
AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WAS ELECTED

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.795
NOT TO BE DONE. IN THAT

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:54.397
BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHERS

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.766
I WAS A FIVE RESTROOMS AND THEY

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:59.302
THEY ARE UPDATED THREE- THEY

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:02.439
WERE SELECTED AND- SOME OF THE

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.707
CATEGORIES WHICH ARE CHANGES

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.842
THEY MADE. THINGS THAT IN SOME

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.577
CASES ARE ACTUALLY OKAY BECAUSE

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.913
THAT BUILDING. HAS A NON OFFICE

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.882
USE AND- IT WAS IT WAS FAR FAR

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.284
LESS BAD SHAPE THAN THE REST OF

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.353
THE BUILDING OTHER CASES WHERE

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.621
YES I SUSPECT THAT IN FUTURE%

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.688
BUDGETS WILL BE COMING BACK

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:22.359
AND- IN ASKING FOR SUPPORT YOU.

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.927
TO COMPLETE WHICH HAD BEEN DONE

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.762
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO- SO THIS

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.664
PROJECTS AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.899
SORT OF- BUT IT'S MASSIVE

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:31.101
STROKE DIFFERENCE I THINK THIS

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.435
IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY OF

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:37.907
PUTTING IT. ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:40.010
DIFFERENCE. WELL IT IT IS FAIR

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:42.012
TO SAY THAT THAT THE- A NEW.

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.713
NOW AND BASED ON. THE WORK THAT

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.515
WAS IN TWENTY FIFTH AND THAT.

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.083
THERE WAS MORE. THERE WAS MORE

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.852
OF AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT IT WOULD

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:50.854
TAKE TO BRING IT UP TO THAT

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.956
CURRENT STANDARDS AT THIS POINT

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.824
MAVERICK I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT.

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.359
WHY IT WOULD IF YOU IF YOU'RE

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:57.494
GOING TO DO IT M. A

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.531
METHODOLOGY. OF BEGINI IS

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:04.668
DESIGN BUILD- IT'S A IT'S A

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.670
METHODOLOGY DESIGNED TO GET YOU

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:09.172
UP QUICKER PROJECT. FOR LESS

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.908
COST AND YET IT WENT UP 43% AND

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.076
SO TO ME THAT DOESN'T MAKE A

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.210
LOT OF SENSE UNLESS SHE GOT

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:15.111
INTO THE PROJECT AND YOU

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.946
REALIZED IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:17.647
MORE THAN THAT AND WE'RE GOING

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:21.051
TO HAVE TO. REPLACE OR REDUCE.

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.952
A LOT MORE THAN WE THOUGHT.

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.554
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.622
CERTAINLY THAT'S CERTAINLY PART

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.824
OF WHAT HAPPENED- BUT I GUESS

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:30.326
MAYBE TO MAKE IT. A LITTLE

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.929
MORE. DIRECT WHEN WE ESTIMATED

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.597
THE PROJECT COSTS AT THE VERY

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.132
BEGINNING NOW THAT THERE WAS

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:40.236
NO- BASIS THAT WE HAD WE WERE

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.071
WE ARE COMING UP WITH THE

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:42.205
RENOVATION COSTS THAT WE

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:44.407
THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:45.508
IS A BUILDING PROJECT ACROSS

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.843
THE STREETS LITERALLY ACROSS

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.912
THE STREET THAT WAS RENOVATED-

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.447
AND SO WE USE THOSE PROJECT

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:53.083
COSTS AS THE PROXY MEASURE OR

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:54.751
THE ORIGINAL RENOVATION. AND

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.086
UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS AN ERROR

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.454
ON OUR PART TO DO SO BECAUSE

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.555
THE SCOPES FOR JUST SUCH A

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.457
MISALIGNED SO NOT ONLY. DID WE

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.258
FUNDAMENTALLY. PROVIDE THE

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.694
WRONG PROJECT BASIS IN THE

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:05.261
BEGINNING IN TWENTY EIGHT TO

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:07.664
NINETEEN. WHICH WE OWN UP TO IN

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:10.233
THE HEARING LAST YEAR- BUT ALSO

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.001
AS WE INVESTIGATE THE BUILDING

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.703
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.306
WRONG WITH IT AND WE HAD JUST.

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.308
GOT IT. THAT'S I'M VERY DIRECT

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.809
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.211
THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM I

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:22.045
THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:23.346
DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.181
AND I WOULD. RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.249
STATE TREASURER HAVE THAT

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:28.184
CONVERSATION WITH THE- WITH

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:34.924
DTS- BUT THIS IS A HOLD. OPEN

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:47.670
ITEM SO WHAT WE WILL DO THAT.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:49.639
THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT I

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:51.207
UNDERSTAND THAT STATE TREASURER

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.209
HAS ONE FINAL COMMENT TO MAKE.

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:55.678
YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.280
KNOW- I WAS ON THE STATE BOARD

00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:00.717
OF EQUALIZATION BACK IN TWENTY

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:01.317
FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:03.153
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW A

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.788
LITTLE BIT BOUT THE STATE

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:05.955
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUILDING

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:08.258
AT FOUR FIFTY AND- THEY HAD

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:10.493
SCAFFOLDING UP THERE FOR MANY

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.761
YEARS IT'S STILL THERE BECAUSE

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.763
THE WINDOWS WERE POPPING OUT-

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.365
WE HAD FLOODING ISSUES WHEN IT

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.600
RAINED IT WENT UP THE RAIN

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:18.701
WOULD COME DOWN THE STAIRWELLS

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:21.004
WE HAD. PLANTS GROWING OUT OF

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.539
THE WATER FOUNTAIN AND SO WE

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.640
REALLY WERE ASKING THE

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.809
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BACKBENCH TO

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:29.012
PLEASE PRIORITIZE THAT BUILDING

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:31.080
TO RENOVATE IT AND THEY WENT

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.882
OUT WITH THE STUDY AND THE

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:35.685
STUDY CAME OUT WITH THEIR TOP

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.020
TWENTY NINE BUILDINGS THAT

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.588
NEEDED TO BE RENOVATED AND THE

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.356
BE- EACH BUILDING WAS NOT ON

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:43.159
THAT LIST AND EVEN THOUGH I

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:43.960
THINK THAT BUILDINGS REALLY

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.895
SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IN THE TOP

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.831
TEN BUT IT WASN'T AND SO WE ARE

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:50.400
ALL GOING BY THAT STUDY THAT

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:53.236
THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT AND SO MY

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.537
ISSUE IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.140
ISSUE A STUDY PUT IT OUT THERE

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.242
USE IT AS A MEANS FOR

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:02.378
ALLOCATIONS WAR PRIORITIES AND

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:05.415
THEN NOT GO BUY IT OR NOT

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.083
RENOVATED THEN THAT'S STUDY

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.218
REALLY PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:10.720
REDONE BECAUSE IT IS VERY

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:13.256
DISINGENUOUS TO PUT IT INTO A

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.924
BUILDING THAT IS RANKED WORSE

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:17.393
WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND THE

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.796
CAPITAL IS USING THAT STUDY AS

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:21.464
THE STUDY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:23.733
BE PRIORITIZED SO- THAT'S

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.269
ANOTHER THING THAT- IS VERY

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.404
DISCONCERTING. TO ME AND IS

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:33.610
VERY VERY HARD. FOR ME TO SELL

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.577
TO MY STAFF. UNDERSTOOD AND IT

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.712
MAKES A OF WHOLE HECK OF A LOT

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:38.014
OF SAN AND- I'M- I'M SENSITIVE

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:44.354
TO THAT- SO. I GUESS MY E. WE

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.956
WILL THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.291
AS I SAID THERE'S A LOT MORE

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.526
DISCUSSION TO BE HAD AND- HI I

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.262
WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:53.796
SURE THAT. YOUR OFFICE GETS

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.065
HEARD AND THAT WE WEIGH IN ON

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:59.168
ON. ON WHETHER THE RENOVATION

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:00.403
OF THIS BUILDING IS THE HIGHEST

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.772
PRIORITY- GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.140
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON SO I

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.108
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:06.376

RIGHT TO BE- REBUILDING IS A

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.484
DISASTER AND- THE FACT THAT IT

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.286
DIDN'T END UP ON ANY LIST IS.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.755
IS A IS OF CONCERN BECAUSE THEN

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:19.923
YOU START QUESTIONING THE LIST

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:22.025

IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WILL-

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.501
WE'LL MOVE ON WE'LL GO BACK TO

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:38.741
ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:42.545
YES ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.347
WHICH IS THE SACRAMENTO REGION

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:44.847
GREGORY BATESON BUILDING

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:47.750
RENOVATION. SURE FROM THE

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:50.053

VERY GOOD- HI I HAVE A COUPLE

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:36.392
OF QUESTIONS IF I COULD- THIS

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.627
IS AN ITEM THAT IS BEING

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.296
REQUESTED TO BE HOLD HELD OPEN

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:41.797
BUT I'M JUST WERE WONDERING IF

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.299
YOU COULD ADDRESS TWO ISSUES

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:46.402
THAT- THAT HAVE ME A LITTLE BIT

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.471
CONCERNED ONE IS. THAT THE

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:51.640
IMPACT OF TELEWORKING- DURING

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:54.243
THIS PANDEMIC. I THINK WE'VE

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.878
LEARNED SOME LESSONS ABOUT THE

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.346
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.615

DONE THAT ARE REQUIRED- AND I'M

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:05.788
WONDERING IF. IT MAKES SENSE

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.658
FOR US TO LOOK AT. CONTRACTING

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:12.228
THE AB STATIONS THE AB CHARGING

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:14.497
STATIONS RATHER THAN MAKING A

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.865
STATE INVESTMENT IN

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.867
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:21.937
OBSOLETE IN JUST A FEW YEARS.

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:23.739
SO I THINK ARE YOU RAISE A

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.574
VALID QUESTION THERE'S A COUPLE

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.042
OF THINGS I WANT TO MENTION IN

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.378
RESPONSE TO THAT ONE IS THAT WE

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.014
ARE IN IN. ANTICIPATING AN

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.216
INCREASE IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:36.118
CHARGING NEEDS IN SPITE OF THE

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:38.187
FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.256
LIKELY CONTINUING TO WORK AND

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.791
SOME REMOTE WORKING CAPACITY

STRATEGY ISN'T AND HOW GIVE ME

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.682
A PRACTICAL APPLICATION FOR HOW

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:27.816
IT WOULD BE USED BECAUSE IT

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.152
JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE. MAN I'M

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:32.521

DAY. AND EVERY TIME WE DO THAT

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:39.594
IT COST THE TAX PAYERS AND AT

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.663
SOME POINT WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.665
WHAT ARE THE MOST NECESSARY

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.700
THINGS THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.368
DONE. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.003
GET THE DRIVER'S LICENSES THEY

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.637
WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:50.339
UNEMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY WHEN

GET DISABILITY IF THEY'RE HURT

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.744

YOUR DATA SKILLS THAT THEY NEED

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.796
TO ACTUALLY USE THAT DATA WELL

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:55.964
TO MAKE BETTER PROGRAM

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.232
DECISIONS WHETHER IT'S HOW

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.567

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.805
WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.442

RIGHT DATA I'M HERE SO THAT CAN

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:20.388
WORK WITH IT THEY DON'T LESS

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:22.090
AFFECT SO WE STARTED A PROGRAM

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:24.025
CALLED THE DAY TOOLS FOR THEN

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:27.262
SURE ARE DATA STAFF AROUND HAD

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.763
TO TOOLS AND UNDERSTAND WHY AND

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.833
HOW THEY CAN USE THEM ACTIVELY

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.335
SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF-

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.903
SPACE PROGRAMS WERE ON AND

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.439
PROGRAM IS CALLED THE ACT WAS

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.241

WE LEVERAGE THAT THAT DATA HER

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.482
JUST ACROSS THE STATE SO IT'S

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.384
NOT HAPPENING INDIVIDUALLY

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.353
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IT IS

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.688
DAMAGING DATA GOVERNANCE TO

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:54.890
ENSURE THAT IT ONE DEPARTMENT

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.791
GOES OUT TO BUY DATA THAT THERE

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:57.959
MAY BE TAKING INTO

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.761
CONSIDERATION OTHER DEPARTMENT

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.196
YET SO WE'RE ONLY BUYING IT

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:02.898
ONCE I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:04.666
BALK OR ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.201
ABOUT THAT ONE LAST FINAL

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.969
EXAMPLE AND SOMETHING I'VE BEEN

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.437
PERSONALLY INVOLVED IT IS

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:11.239
ENSURING THAT AS WE DO BUILD

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.974
OUT YOUR DATA SYSTEMS ONE OF

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.643
THEM BEING THE HOMELESS DATA

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.711
INTEGRATION SYSTEM. ONE THAT'S

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:23.385
UNDER PLANNING IS CRADLE. TO

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:24.152
CAREER TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.987
USING APPROACHES ARE. THE THOSE

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:28.023
EFFORTS SO. I GUESS THE AND- IS

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:30.091
INDIA. AND TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.226
WE HAVE STATURE COULD NOT BUT

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.094
AROUND EIGHT AT. IMPRINT

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.063
IMPRESSIONS GET A MAN'S MAN.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.032
HAVEN'T HAD THAT. AND SO

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.733
BUILDING ON THAT KNOWLEDGE THE

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.669
ROLE OF THE CIO. AT THE FEDERAL

NINETY FIVE UNDER THE CLINGER

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:46.107
COHEN ACT AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:47.676
OF WORK DEVELOP AROUND THAT.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.244
THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE ARE

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.079
FOUNDATIONS OF EVIDENCE BASED

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.847
POLICY CREATED THE ROLE OF THIS

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:55.116
CBO AT THE AGENCY LEVEL AND THE

EIGHTEEN. SO THE NEWER ROLE. IN

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:03.391
AND FIGURE OUT- WHERE IT CAN

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.926
HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE AND HELP

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.728
IS ACTUALLY IS PART OF WHAT WE

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.930
WILL BE WORKING. THE LEAD TO

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.165
VERY HELPFUL AND I REALLY

THERE'S SOME CONSISTENCY AND

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.744
HOW DATA IS COLLECTED AND I'M

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.246
AND HOW IT'S USED AT THE MAKES

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:27.015

KNOW. PART OF OUR PROBLEM IN

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.355
THE STATE IS THE STATE IS SO

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.590

DEALING WITH DATA THAT. TO THE

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.664
EXTENT IT'S PERSONALIZED IS

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.300
PROTECTED BUT- REALLY BAD CAN

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:48.169
BE CLEANED SO THAT THE DATA IS

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.871
UTILIZED SO HOW ARE YOU GOING

INFORMATION THAT ARE HEALTH AND

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:11.459
HUMAN SERVICES. AGENCY HAS SOME

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:12.894
OF WHICH IS PROTECTED BUT

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.462
PROBABLY CAN MAY BE MADE ON

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:17.332
PROTECTED IN ORDER FOR THE USES

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.067
THAT ARE IMPORTANT. HOW DO YOU

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.802
GET YOUR ARMS AROUND THAT

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.505
BECAUSE OF COURSE. SOMETIMES

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.873
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW GOVERNMENT

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.408
AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS DON'T

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:29.778
KNOW AS- SECRETARY RUMSFELD

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:30.378
ONCE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:35.116
YOU DON'T KNOW. CHIU LATELY I

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:36.718
TALK ABOUT A DATA FALLS INTO A

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.186
FEW BUCKETS ONE THE DATA WE

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:40.522
KNOW WE HAVE YET WE HAVEN'T

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.123
FIGURED OUT HOW TO INSTRUMENT

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.358
IT SO IT'S AT THE READY THAT'S

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.593
ONE SET OF PROBLEMS- DATA THAT

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.661
WE KNOW WE NEED BUT WE DON'T

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.530
HAVE ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.332
STATE'S RECENT ACQUISITION OF

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:51.399
SATELLITE IMAGERY THAT'S

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.469
ANOTHER AND THEN THE DATA THAT.

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.971
WE- THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE BUT

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.006
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY DID

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.574
EXIST OR WE HAVE TO CREATE IT

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.343
IN EACH OF THOSE CREATES. A

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.811
DIFFERENT SORT OF PROBLEM TO

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.546
YOUR BROADER QUESTION OF HOW TO

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.381
COORDINATE AND PUT OUR HANDS

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.550
AROUND THIS. THAT'S WHERE WERE

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.918
REVAMPING IN LAUNCHING

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.419
SOMETHING HEALTHY AND GET COLD

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.754
CAL DATA COMMUNITIES THAT'S

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.855
GOING TO WORK TO CREATE

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.490
SYSTEMATIC GOVERNANCE AROUND IT

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:16.524
BUT IT ALSO MEANS I'M

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:17.959
PARTNERING WITH THE CONTROL

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:20.762
AGENCIES LIKE C. AND DIGESTER

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.864
ENSURE THAT. WHEN WE HAVE DATA

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.632
ISSUES THAT TOUCH THEIR SYSTEMS

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:27.702
WE HAVE A POINT OF CONTROL. I'M

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.437
ON THE ON THE NOTION OF- DID

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:31.439
EXCHANGE WE ARE WORKING ON

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.007
SOMETHING CALLED INTERAGENCY

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.576
DATA EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WHICH I

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:35.910
BELIEVE I SPOKE WITH THIS

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:38.713
GROUP- ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.448
WHAT THAT IS DOINGIS IT'S

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.951
CREATING A SINGLE- UMBRELLA

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:45.053
AGREEMENT FOR DATA EXCHANGE TO

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.055
NEGOTIATE THE EXCHANGE OF.

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:48.790
PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ENSURE

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.725
THAT THAT IS. LAWFUL AND

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.727
APPROPRIATE. BUT IT'S ALSO DONE

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:55.897
SECURELY AND CONSISTENTLY AND-

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.132
THAT IS ACTUALLY AN

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.868
ADMINISTRATIVE- TOOL THAT WE

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.336
ONE YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:02.804
NORMALLY NEGOTIATING THESE

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:03.705
KINDS OF DATA EXCHANGE

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.707
AGREEMENTS. I'VE SEEN THEM TAKE

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.243
UP TO TEN YEARS. BUT OFTEN

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:11.179
YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE FROM A YEAR

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:15.116

FOR. BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS TO.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.252
AGREEMENTS AND WHY WE'RE SCHEME

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.620
THE WAR AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:19.821
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.623
AGENCY WHERE WITH AN AGENCY

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.625
THEY ADOPTED A SINGLE CREAM AND

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.093
FOR DOING THAT DATA EXCHANGE

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.161
WHEN THEY ADOPTED THAT

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.462
GREENMAN. THEIR TYPICAL

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.364
NEGOTIATIONS OF DATA EXCHANGE

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.866
WENT FROM I BELIEVE IT WAS- ON

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:34.235
A YEAR AND A HALF TO SEVENTY

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.704
NINE DAYS. SO WE NEED THOSE

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.206
ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS THE FACT

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:40.041
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD COMMONDATA

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.009
EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:44.145
LANGUAGE IS A TOOL THAT WE NEED

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:45.713
TO BUILD OUT AND SUPPORT. ON

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.081
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SOLVE THE

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:48.450
CULTURAL PIECES AND THAT'S

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:49.818
WHERE WE WERE LYING COMMUNITIES

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:53.688
AND CREATING- NETWORKS OF- DATA

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.490
AND DATA ADVOCATES ACROSS THE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:56.825
STATE AND THIS IS SOMETHING

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.092
CERTAINLY THAT I WORKED ON IN

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.694
SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WAS THE

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.696
CHIEF DATA OFFICER THERE. ON

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:02.997

PROGRAMMING INCLUDE PLAYBOOKS

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.544
AROUND THAT SO IN SHORT WE HAVE

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.213
TO HAVE SHARED RESOURCES AND

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:22.717

APPROVED AND THIS LACK OF

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:12.466
POLICY IS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.535
IT MEANS THE LEGISLATURE LACKS

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:16.103

EVEN LARGER. AND THE BROADBAND

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:19.200
DIFFICULTIES IN THE RIVER AND

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:20.801
REMOTE RURAL REGIONS OF THE

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.204
COUNTY ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:24.939
POINT THAT OF COURSE SUBSIDIES

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.574
ARE NOT REALLY THE ISSUE.

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.743

BUSINESSES AND LIVES THAT ARE

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.931
DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS

AND SHOWN THAT IT MUST THAT WE

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:08.769

MORE RESILIENT TO MEET THE

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.071
MOMENTS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY

TELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID IS WE

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:16.476
WENT OUT AND I'M- PARTICIPATION

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:17.277
IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:19.246
PANDEMICS ERECTED MORE THAN

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.614
SIXTY INTERVIEWS ACROSS AGENCY

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:22.549
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADERS. NOT

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.884
JUST IN TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO ON

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.585
THE PROGRAM SIDE. WE ENGAGE

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:27.387
WITH MANY MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:30.123
AND STAFF- WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.358
AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:32.893
THE WITH BRIAN AND THE L. A. O.

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.561
TEAM. AS WELL AS WITH LOCAL

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:36.763
GOVERNMENTS WE ENGAGED OVER

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:37.397
FOUR HUNDRED PROVIDERS

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:39.232
INCLUDING 30% WHO'D NEVER DONE

01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:41.001
BUSINESS WITH THE STATE BEFORE.

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:43.070
SURVEYED STAFF ACROSS THE STATE

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:44.071
REALLY IT SHOULD JUST

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:46.173
CONTEXTUALIZE THE PICTURE OF

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:48.208
HOW TECHNOLOGY WAS BEING USED

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:50.977
IN COULD BE USED ACROSS THE

01:45:51.044 --> 01:45:52.946
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.548
LEARNED OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.116
WAS THAT WE MADE A LOT OF

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:57.818
PROGRESS AND CRITICALLY IN THE

01:45:57.884 --> 01:45:59.519
CONTEXT OF COVE IT CAN MAKE IT

01:45:59.586 --> 01:46:01.755
REALLY QUICKLY BUT THAT WASN'T

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.590
ENOUGH WE NEED TO BOTH SOLVE

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.158
PROBLEMS TOGETHER AND SO THAT

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.893
MEANS BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.928
AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:10.664
POLICY TOGETHER TO HELP DESIGN

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.165
AND DO THIS WORK IT MEANS

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.234
ENGAGING OUR USERS ENGAGING OUR

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.702
STAKEHOLDERS FOR CRITICAL

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:19.106
PARTICIPANTS IN THE ACTUAL USE

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:20.240
OF THE TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:21.875
EASIER AND FASTER WAYS TO GET

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:23.777
STARTED- WE CAN'T ADMIRE THE

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:26.046
PROBLEMS FOR TOO LONG- AND

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.214
ACTUALLY PUSH OUT THE

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.316
EXPERIENCE OF THE USER. SEEING

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:31.885
NEW FUNCTIONALITY. AND THERE IS

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.353
A NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:33.987
ONE HAD THE RIGHT ANSWER WASN'T

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:36.123
THAT THE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:37.758
SENATOR NELSON THESE ARE THESE

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:40.594
ARE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS- AND

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.296
THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF. A LOT OF

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:44.731
ELBOW GREASE TO BE ABLE TO

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:47.033
RESOLVE THEM. AND SO WE PUT OUT

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.168
THREE GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:49.736
HELP DIRECT THE WAY THAT WE

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.905
ENGAGE IN THIS WORK AS A STATE

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:54.508
AND PUT OUT FIVE GOALS. THE

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:55.308
THREE THE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE

01:46:55.375 --> 01:46:57.744
FIRST PUT PEOPLE FIRST SO AT

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:58.945
THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:02.048
BUILDING TECHNOLOGY FOR TO

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:03.116
DELIVER SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.185
OF CALIFORNIA- AND WE NEED TO

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:06.086
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:07.921
INTO CONSIDERATION AND LEARNING

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:09.389
AND UNDERSTANDING AND BUILDING

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:10.857
FOR THOSE PEOPLE. AS WELL AS

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.425
THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:14.461
DELIVER THE SERVICES SO. YOU

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:15.929
KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT A PUBLIC

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:16.696
SERVANT WHO'S LOOKING AT A

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:18.532
GREEN SCREEN AND TRYING TO DO

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:20.600
THE RIGHT THING BY- BY A

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:22.235
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT GOOD

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:23.069
ENOUGH WE ACTUALLY NEED TO MAKE

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:24.471
THE EXPERIENCE BETTER FOR THE

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:27.474
PUBLIC SERVANT AS WELL. TO WE

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.209
NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:30.410
MAKING CONTINUOUS AND TIMELY

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:32.045
IMPROVEMENTS- CONTINUOUS IN THE

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:33.046
SENSE THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.648
THE VELOCITY OF CHANGE IN OUR

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.283
SYSTEMS. BUT ALSO WE NEED TO

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:37.617
ENSURE THAT SYSTEMS WORK AS

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:39.252
DESIGNED WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED.

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.854
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.322
TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS

01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:43.824
DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU ACTUALLY

01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:44.825
NEED SOMETHING THAT'S URGENT

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:48.328
FROM YOUR. GOVERNMENT YOU NEED

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:48.895
AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THE

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:49.696
THIRD IS WORKING TO. IT'S

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.331
WORKING ALONE AND THAT REALLY

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:53.066
SPEAKS TO THE COLLABORATION

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:55.101
THAT'S REQUIRED ACROSS.

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:57.037
TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.705
OPERATIONS OF THE STATE BUT

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.340
ALSO IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:02.809
WITH OUR USERS- AND SO IN THE

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.144
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OBVIOUSLY

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:05.645
YOU SEE A LOT MORE INTEGRATED

01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:07.047
TEAMS WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCT

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:08.548
TEAMS AND- INTEGRATION ACROSS

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:09.850
DISCIPLINES AS WELL BETWEEN

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.852
ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT AND

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.954
USER RESEARCH. AND THAT IS AS

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.322
IMPORTANT TO DO YOU IN IN

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:16.556
GOVERNMENT AS IT IS IN THE

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:19.059
PRIVATE SECTOR. WE PUT UP FIVE

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:21.127
GOALS- AND I'LL SKIP THROUGH

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:23.830
THIS QUICKLY- AND HAPPY TO GO

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:26.132
INTO MORE DETAIL AS NEEDED-

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:27.801
DELIVER EASY TO USE FAST

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:28.902
DEPENDABLE AND SECURE PUBLIC

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.570
SERVICES AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOU

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:32.038
TALK TO ME- AT THE BEGINNING OF

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:33.473
THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WOULD

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.608
HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.977
EASY TO USE AND FAST- GIVEN THE

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:38.011
COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:39.446
MONTHS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FOCUS

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:42.182
ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE- AND

01:48:42.249 --> 01:48:43.583
THAT YOU KNOW TO DIRECTOR TALKS

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.851
POINT EARLIER THIS IS PART OF

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.987
WHAT HELPS FRAME. THE P. C. P.

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.622
PROPOSAL AROUND STABILIZING

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:49.923
CRITICAL SERVICES BECAUSE THE

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.258
LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:52.525
IS RESPOND AFTER SOMETHING

01:48:52.592 --> 01:48:54.127
FAILS WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:57.163
IT AND STABILIZE IT IN ADVANCE.

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.365
TO IS ENSURING THAT OUR PUBLIC%

01:48:58.431 --> 01:48:59.532
SERVICES ARE EQUITABLE AND

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:02.302
INCLUSIVE AND SO- REFER FROM

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:03.370
SEVERAL SENATORS ARE BROWN

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:04.504
DEPARTMENTS OF THIS IN THE

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.239
CONTEXT OF BROADBAND. BUT IT'S

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:07.641
BIGGER THAN JUST BROADBAND IT'S

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:09.276
ALSO ABOUT THE CONTENT IN THE

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:11.144
DESIGN AND THE OPERATION OF OUR

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:13.880
SERVICES SO TO USE A SIMPLIFIED

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:17.050
EXAMPLE- THE READABILITY OF OUR

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:18.385
WEBSITE SOME OF THE CONTENT

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:19.719
THAT WE PUT OUT INTO THE WORLD

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:21.755
OFTEN EXCESSIVE POSTGRADUATE

01:49:21.821 --> 01:49:23.390
READING LEVEL- WORDS IF WE WANT

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:25.091
TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR SERVICES

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:26.726
ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.028
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:29.129
SHOULD BE TARGETING A SEVENTH

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:30.664
OR NINTH GRADE READING LEVEL.

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.232
IT TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY HARD

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:33.800
TO WRITE AT THAT LEVEL THAT

01:49:33.867 --> 01:49:34.601
REQUIRES SIMPLIFICATION COURSE

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.336
WORK AND THAT'S AS TRUE ON THE

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:40.974
PROCESS. SIDE AS WELL. THE

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.409
THIRD IS MAKING COMMENT. EASY

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:45.412
TO. USE AND RE USE ACROSS STATE-

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:46.579
AND SO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.782
IS A- IDENTIFICATION SO IN THE

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.483
CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC WHERE THE

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:52.018
IS A PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS TO BE

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:54.421
IN PERSON. ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:56.423
MYSELF AS A THE PERSON THAT I

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:57.924
SAY I AM. IS AN IMPORTANT

01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:01.027
UNLOCKED FOR THE WAY THAT WE

01:50:01.094 --> 01:50:03.330
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND RIGHT

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.464
NOW THAT PROBLEM IS GETTING

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:06.533
SOLVE MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS THE

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:07.934
STATE. AND WE WANT TO HELP MAKE

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.135
SURE THAT WE'RE FEDERATING THAT

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:11.071
UP AND- CREATING THE RIGHT

01:50:11.137 --> 01:50:12.539
INTEROPERABLE LADY ACROSS THE

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:13.840
STATE OF CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:16.443
SOLVING MATTER PROGRAM. OR

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.677
DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL. THE FOURTH

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:19.179
IS BUILDING DIGITAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:20.213
MORE QUICKLY AND MORE

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.749
EFFECTIVELY. AND SO- CENTER

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.284
PARK PART OF THE QUESTION-

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:25.418
AROUND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE

01:50:25.485 --> 01:50:26.519
ENSURE THAT PROJECTS MORE

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:28.688
SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD. IS

01:50:28.755 --> 01:50:30.357
THAT ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:32.525
ASSUMPTIONS THAT GOES BEHIND A

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:34.227
LOT OF BIG TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.562
IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:37.163
MISTER RIP AND REPLACE EXISTING

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:39.899
LEGACY SYSTEMS. WELL ONE OF THE

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:40.767
CHALLENGES THAT WE WANT TO BE

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:42.035

THAT INFORMATION AND IT'S

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.801
PARTICULARLY CRITICAL BECAUSE I

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:22.635
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.804
YOU HAVE. THE CONTRACT

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.939
NEGOTIATED BY ONE SET OF

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.408
INDIVIDUALS AND THEN YOU HAVE

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.376
THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT IN THE

01:57:30.443 --> 01:57:32.044
HANDS OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:36.082
AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE-

01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:38.851
THE OUT THE OUTCOMES ARE THE

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:40.887
DELIVERABLES THAT THE CONTRACT.

01:57:40.953 --> 01:57:42.422
INVASIONS AND SO WHEN THOSE

01:57:42.488 --> 01:57:45.091
DELIVERABLS. ARE NOT MET BUT

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:47.059
THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFIED AS A

01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:48.895
PROBLEM IN THE CONTRACT YOU

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:50.730
START LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:57:50.797 --> 01:57:55.802
HOLD THE- THE CONTRACTOR TO

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:56.903
THAT CONTRACT AND IT BECOMES

01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:58.671
VERY DIFFICULT LEGALLY AFTER

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:00.206
THE FACT TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:02.508
SATISFACTION YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:03.342
NEGOTIATING A CONTRACT ALL OVER

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:05.778
AGAIN. SENATE ROTH THANK YOU

01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:06.412
MAN I'M SURE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:08.581
OUT OF THIS THE END OF OUR

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:09.415
BUSINESS FOR A COUPLE YEARS

01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:12.185
BUT- MISS TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:15.288
SUCCESSFUL ARE YOU IN TERMS OF

01:58:15.354 --> 01:58:17.523
PROPERLY SCOPING THESE. IT

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:19.859
PROJECTS SO WE TRY TO START

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:22.061
WITH THE SMALLEST. COMMON

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:23.496
DENOMINATOR AND THEN BUILD ON

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:25.965
THAT TRYING TO IF TO THE EXTENT

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:28.334
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOSS

01:58:28.401 --> 01:58:28.868
TO MINIMIZE LOSSES WE MOVE

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:31.070
FORWARD. I SEEM TO REMEMBER

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:33.840
THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF YEARS AGO

01:58:33.906 --> 01:58:35.875
FOLLOWING SOME RATHER LARGE IT

01:58:35.942 --> 01:58:38.077
FAILURES. AND THE VARIOUS

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:40.213
COMMENTATORS ON IT PROJECTS AT

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:41.247
THE TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:43.483
TRYING TO SCALE DOWN THE SCOPE

01:58:43.549 --> 01:58:45.918
OF THE IT PROJECTS AND YOU KNOW

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:47.487
BY THE END SHOULD SISENSE BY

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:49.589
THE YARD IT'S HARD SO. I GUESS

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:50.656
THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS HOW

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:51.924
SUCCESSFUL WE'VE BEEN

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:54.360
IMPROPERLY SCOPING IT PROJECTS

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:56.596
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET DONE

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:58.431
WHAT WE CAN GET DONE AND THEN

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:02.835
BUILD ON THAT. TRYING TO AVOID

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:04.303
FAILURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.471
SENATOR ROBERT DEFINITELY

01:59:05.538 --> 01:59:07.106
REMEMBER THAT FROM THE FROM THE

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:09.041
DAY THAT I STEP IN THIS ROLE

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.843
AND YOU HAVE BEEN A- VERY

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:13.112
CONSTRUCTIVE UNEMPLOYED AND IN

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:14.514
TERM OF GOSH THERE'S GOING TO

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.182
BE. A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS AND

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:17.683
YES IT WAS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:19.352
YEARS AGO- THAT THE

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:21.387
CONVERSATION HAVE STARTED ON

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:22.722
HOW THE STATE ARE SHIFTING FROM

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:24.557
THESE GIGANTIC MONOLITHIC

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:27.226
PROJECTS WHICH WE SEE THEM.

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:29.629
BACK DOWN AS THE NORM TO NOW

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:32.064
FOUR YEARS LATER THAT MAJORITY

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:34.333
OF THESE PROJECTS ARE NO LONGER

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.801
THESE MODERNIZE THE ELECTRIC

01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:38.704
MULTI YEARS- I'M LITERALLY JUST

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:41.207
PULLING UP THE- A PERFORMANCE

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:46.178
METRICS. ARE PRESENTED IN THE-

01:59:46.245 --> 01:59:47.980
PERFORMANCE REPORT TO TWENTY.

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:50.583
AND IF YOU CAN INDULGE ME FOR A

01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:51.951
MINUTE HERE I CAN PUT THE

01:59:52.018 --> 01:59:53.719
ACTUAL NUMBER SAY HOW MANY

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:57.089
PROJECTS ARE HAVE BEEN REDUCED-

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:59.725
BUT THERE YOU GO. SO THREE

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:02.595
YEARS AGO- I WOULD SAY 8290% OF

02:00:02.662 --> 02:00:04.263
THE PROJECT THERE ARE COMING IN

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:06.666
IN THE HUNDREDS OF. MILLIONS OF

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.701
DOLLARS AND THEY'RE AVERAGING

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.603
YEARS OR FIVE YEARS OR MORE TO

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:12.838
RUN AND OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER

02:00:12.905 --> 02:00:15.174
OF. YEARS AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:17.843
EQUATES TO HIGHER RISK. TODAY

02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:20.646
WE HAVE MAJORITY OF THOSE RE OF

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:23.616
PROJECTS ARE DOWN TO. IN THAT

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:26.152
SIDE IS AN EX. ALL TO RIGHT NOW

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:28.020
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:31.123
WHILE- OTHER LARGE PROJECT

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.658
TWENTY ONE OF THEM ARE IN WHAT

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:34.860
WE CALL THE SMALLER SCALE- AND

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:36.362
THEN THE SMALLER SCALE DOES NOT

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:37.630
NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:39.265
PIECEMEAL I THINK THAT'S THE

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:39.932
IMPORTANT POINT THAT WERE ALSO

02:00:39.999 --> 02:00:42.201
TRYING TO MAKE. IT STOP YOU

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:44.971
MIGHT HAVE A MASTER PLAN TO

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:47.974
ACHIEVE A GOAL HOWEVER THAT

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.776
EACH OF THOSE. MODULES CAN BE

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:53.145
MANAGED AND DEMONSTRATE THE SSS

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.181
BEFORE ADDITIONAL MODULES CAN

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:58.050
BE APPROVED SO THAT SO THAT I

02:00:58.117 --> 02:00:59.418
THINK THE STATE OF ALSO GONE

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:01.320
THROUGH ITS LEARNING PROCESS.

02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:02.755
FROM YOU KNOW COMPLETING MOVING

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:04.223

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.758
LARGE PROJECTS TO THE AGILE

02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.793
PROCESS AND FOUR MINUTE MAKING

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.428

THE TOTALITY OF THE INVESTMENT

CHILDREN- THAT THE PROJECT STEP-

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:12.497
IT GOING TO VARY FROM TIME TO

02:21:12.564 --> 02:21:14.332
TIME WE DON'T FOR INSTANCE HAVE

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:15.934
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROCESS

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:16.868
CHANGES OF THE REGULATIONS

02:21:16.935 --> 02:21:18.636
UNIT. WAS WE CUT OUT THE

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.038
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS STEP THAT

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:20.972
YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR IN YOUR

02:21:21.039 --> 02:21:23.608
SUMMARY- WE'VE ALSO CUT OUT

02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:25.009
STEPS BOTH AT THE LEGAL

02:21:25.076 --> 02:21:26.744
DIVISION AND AT THE BUDGET

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:28.546
OFFICE SO THAT THE PROCESS HAS

02:21:28.613 --> 02:21:30.982
CHANGED SOMEWHAT- FROM FROM

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:32.750
THAT DESCRIPTION BUT ROUGHLY IT

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.452
IS. THAT THE CONCEPT IS THE

02:21:34.519 --> 02:21:37.555
SAME WHICH IS. A SORT OF A

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:38.890
SYMBIOTIC DEVELOPMENT OF

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:40.425
REGULATIONS BETWEEN BOARDING

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:42.393
DEPARTMENT. SHOULD MEANING FOR

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.928
DEPARTMENTAL REVIEW SUBMITTING

02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:46.264
FOR AGENCY REVIEW. PUBLIC

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:50.001
NOTICE. AND THEN. BACK TO. THAT

02:21:50.068 --> 02:21:51.336
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP OF

02:21:51.402 --> 02:21:53.771
DEVELOPING THOSE FINAL

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:55.340
DOCUMENTS. OR MENTAL REVIEW

02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:57.108
AGENCY REVIEW DEPARTMENT OF

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.510
FINANCE REVIEW. AND OFFICE OF

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:00.645
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO YOUR

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:02.313
PROCESS CHANGES THE PROCESS

02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:04.115
CHANGES THAT YOU SPEAK ABOUT

02:22:04.182 --> 02:22:06.084
DID THEY RESULT IN ANY

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.651
REDUCTION IN YOUR PROCESSING

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:10.388
TIME. SO AS I MENTIONED THAT

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:11.456
WAS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF

02:22:11.522 --> 02:22:13.658
OUR OUR PROCESS BEFORE WAS WE

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.293
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.061
COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING SYSTEM

02:22:17.128 --> 02:22:20.698
ANECDOTALLY WE HAD HEARD THAT

02:22:20.765 --> 02:22:22.500
THERE WERE ABOUT TWO YEAR LONG.

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.769
SAYS HE'S OF REGULATIONS SO IF

02:22:24.836 --> 02:22:26.504
WE WERE TO ASSUME THAT'S TRUE

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:28.406
THEN WE'VE NOW REDUCED THAT BY

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:31.542
ABOUT 20% DOWN TO- TWENTY

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:32.644
TWENTY MONTHS THAT'S NOT OUR

02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:33.811
GOAL OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP

02:22:33.878 --> 02:22:36.614
IMPROVING ON THIS PROCESS- AND

02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:37.949
SO WE'RE HOPING TO KEEP

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:39.651
CONTINUING TO NOT WALK AWAY AT

02:22:39.717 --> 02:22:41.819
THAT- BUT LIKE I SAID THIS IS

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:43.788
BEEN. BASICALLY IMPLEMENTED NOW

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:45.790
FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF A

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:47.859
BIG A BIG PART OF THAT WAS WAS

02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:48.726
KIND OF IT WHERE WE

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:51.696
TRANSITIONED. FROM WHAT WAS A

02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:54.532
PAPER HEAVY PROCESS AT TO YOU

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:56.601
MUCH MORE FLUID ELECTRONIC

02:22:56.668 --> 02:22:57.669
PROCESS THESE PEOPLE WORKING

02:22:57.735 --> 02:23:00.138
FROM HOME- SO WE'VE WE'VE HAD

02:23:00.204 --> 02:23:01.439
TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT

02:23:01.506 --> 02:23:02.573
WERE NOT ANTICIPATED BUT WE

02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:04.442
HAVE MADE THEM. AND SO WE'RE

02:23:04.509 --> 02:23:05.343
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:06.945
CONTINUE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AS

02:23:07.011 --> 02:23:08.813
I SAID OUR NUMBERS ARE SHOWING

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.148
THAT WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS SO

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:11.316
I'M WE'RE WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:13.284
ASKING FOR IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:16.487
YEARS TO CONTINUE BUILDING ON

02:23:16.554 --> 02:23:17.322
WHAT WE STARTED. WELL MAKES OF

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:19.524
JUST TO MY FLOWSHEET FLOW CHART

02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:21.426
BUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:24.462
KNOW OF ANY OTHER. STATE TO

02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:26.397
STATE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY AT

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:28.199
THE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT LEVEL

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:29.767
THAT UTILIZES THIS TYPE OF

02:23:29.834 --> 02:23:31.269
PROCESS TO PROMULGATE

02:23:31.336 --> 02:23:34.372
REGULATIONS. THE DETAIL PROCESS

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:36.474
THAT I OUTLINED SUBJECT TO THE

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:40.111
CHANGES THAT YOU INDICATED.

02:23:40.178 --> 02:23:42.180
WHAT I CAN'T SAY IT IN TWENTY

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:44.115
NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT I DID A

02:23:44.182 --> 02:23:45.750
PRETTY DEEP DIVE REGULATIONS

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:47.018
REPORT AND PUBLISH THAT

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:48.286
REPORTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:49.988
WEBSITE IN THE COURSE OF DOING

02:23:50.054 --> 02:23:51.756
THAT THE APARTMENT LOOKED AT

02:23:51.823 --> 02:23:53.591
FIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:56.127
BOARDS AND SURVEY THEIR

02:23:56.194 --> 02:23:58.096
DIFFERENT PROCESS EASIER. IT IS

02:23:58.162 --> 02:23:59.364
TRUE THE DIFFERENT STATE

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:00.598
AGENCIES DO IT DIFFERENT WAYS

02:24:00.665 --> 02:24:02.233
DEPENDING ON THEIR MAKE UP THIS

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.534
DEPARTMENT IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:05.870
IN THAT IT'S COMPRISED OF

02:24:05.937 --> 02:24:06.504
LITTLE MANY DEPARTMENTS WITHIN

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.506
A BIGGER DEPARTMENT- WHERE IT'S

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:09.173
ONE OF THE POINT OF THE

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.708
ENTITIES WE SURVEYED BUDGET

02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:12.777
RESOURCES SUPPORT. RESOURCES

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:13.878
FOR DOESN'T HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.179
AT THAT WE DO WITH THIS

02:24:15.246 --> 02:24:17.081
DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS-

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:18.149
BUT OTHER DEPARTMENTS WE LOOK

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.884
AT BERMAN A PUBLIC HEALTH THEY

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.285
HAVE CENTERS WHICH ARE SORT OF

02:24:21.352 --> 02:24:23.087
LIKE SMALL BOARDS AND SO THEY

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:24.655
DO HAVE THE PROCESSES ARE NOT

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:25.923
IDENTICAL TO WHAT I ESCRIBE

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:27.592
BUT THEY DO HAVE KIND OF A-

02:24:27.658 --> 02:24:30.228
CENTER DEPARTMENT AGENCY LEVEL

02:24:30.294 --> 02:24:35.800
REVIEW ON REGULATIONS. SO THERE.

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:36.868
ARE SOME COMPARABLE- TAMPA OUT

02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:38.669
THERE BUT PROBABLY NOTHING BIG.

02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:40.738
LIKE PCA IDEAS SOMEWHAT WAS

02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:41.939
SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN STATE

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:43.007
GOVERNMENT OF THE TIMELINE FOR

02:24:43.074 --> 02:24:44.475
THE AGENCY JUST REFERENCE HOW

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:45.777
LONG ON AVERAGE DOES THAT

02:24:45.843 --> 02:24:48.046
AGENCY TAKE TO PROMULGATE

02:24:48.112 --> 02:24:50.515
REGULATIONS. SHOW THE DATE I

02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:51.516
DON'T RECALL THAT ONE OFF THE

02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:54.152
TOP BUT THE AVERAGE IS- FOR THE

02:24:54.218 --> 02:24:55.720
WHOLE GROUP THAT WE LOOKED AT

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:58.156
THEY RANGE FROM BETWEEN. NINE

02:24:58.222 --> 02:25:00.058
MONTHS TO THREE TO FOUR YEARS

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:01.826
OKAY WHERE IS THE BEERS THE

02:25:01.893 --> 02:25:03.227
ISSUE I'M NOT GONNA BELABORED

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:05.129
HERE THIS YEAR AS YOU KNOW- I

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:06.264
HAVE A DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENT

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:07.165
THIS YEAR SO WE'LL HAVE THIS

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:08.633
CONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:10.935
FORM ON A DIFFERENT DATE. BUT

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:12.637
MY QUESTION IS OBVIOUSLY WE ALL

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:13.538
WANT PERFECTION IN STATE

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.373
GOVERNMENT AND IT'S VERY

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.209
DIFFICULT TO FIND. SO KUDOS TO

02:25:18.276 --> 02:25:19.710
YOU FOR FINDING IT IN THE

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:21.212
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BUT I'M

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:22.613

DEVELOPING INFORMATION AND

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.355
GETTING OUT TO THE CUSTOMER.

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:32.690
WHO NEEDS TO HAVE IT IN ORDER

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:34.192
TO KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE

02:25:34.258 --> 02:25:35.393
RULES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE HERE

02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:37.829
SO. I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING TO

02:25:37.895 --> 02:25:40.231
SEE WHAT SORT OF A- VALUE ADDED

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:42.233
ANALYSIS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

AND THE AGENCY HAS PERFORMED

02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:44.869
WITH RESPECT TO THIS REGULATORY

02:25:44.936 --> 02:25:47.839
PROCESS. TO ANALYZE FOR EXAMPLE

APPROACH TO CANNABIS WITHIN

CALIFORNIA. THIS EFFORT IS

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:54.171
ABOUT TRYING TO REMOVE BARRIERS

02:36:54.238 --> 02:36:55.005
AND PAIN POINTS FOR SMALL

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:57.141
OPERATORS FACE CHALLENGES

MORE EFFICIENT. WE RECOGNIZE

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:14.725
THIS EFFORT WILL REQUIRE

02:37:14.792 --> 02:37:16.093
ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE INITIAL

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.995
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:19.329
AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO PROVIDE

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:23.767
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS. AND

SERVICES DURING THE TRANSITION

02:37:24.434 --> 02:37:25.235
PERIOD. THREE OF EXPERT TO THE

TRANSFER EXISTING. FROM THE

THREE CANNABIS ENTITIES SHE

02:37:28.605 --> 02:37:30.140
THEN. DEPARTMENT WILL IN THIS

02:37:30.207 --> 02:37:32.042
GOAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

02:37:35.979 --> 02:37:37.848
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE

02:37:37.915 --> 02:37:39.316
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:42.419
COMMENTS CONCERNS. YEAH THAT

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:43.954
WAS ME DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL I'M

02:37:44.021 --> 02:37:46.623
SORRY YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I'M

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:49.626
BASED OUT- IT LEGISLATIVE

02:37:49.693 --> 02:37:53.764
ANALYST'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED

02:37:53.831 --> 02:37:54.965
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

02:37:55.032 --> 02:37:56.633
OFFICE FIRST OF ALL WE

02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.901
RECOMMEND APPROVING THE

02:37:57.968 --> 02:37:59.736
CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE WE AGREE

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:00.671
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT

02:38:00.737 --> 02:38:01.705
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:03.207
PROBLEMATIC CURRENTLY THERE'S

02:38:03.273 --> 02:38:05.642
NO LEAD AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:38:05.709 --> 02:38:06.543
REGULATING CANNABIS IN

02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:08.078
CALIFORNIA AND THAT MAKES IT

02:38:08.145 --> 02:38:09.546
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:11.548
TO KNOW WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:13.784
AS WELL AS FOR LICENSEES TO

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:16.119
KNOW WHO TO INTERACT WITH IF

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:16.753
THEY HAVE MULTIPLE LICENSE

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.122
TYPES. ACCORDINGLY WE THINK

02:38:19.189 --> 02:38:21.158
CONSOLIDATION HAS SIGNIFICANT

02:38:21.225 --> 02:38:23.894
POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:24.494
REGULATION OF CANNABIS IN THE

02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:26.697
STATE- HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND

02:38:26.763 --> 02:38:28.365
THAT THE RESOURCES BE APPROVED

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:30.133
ONLY ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:32.169
AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE ONGOING

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:33.203
NEED FOR RESOURCES AREN'T

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:35.205
CLEAR. RIGHT NOW THE CANNABIS

02:38:35.272 --> 02:38:37.140
MARKET IS STILL IN THE PROCESS

02:38:37.207 --> 02:38:38.508
OF MATURING AND THIS CAN BE

02:38:38.575 --> 02:38:39.710
SEEN BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF

02:38:39.776 --> 02:38:42.145
LICENSES ARE THAT WAY SINCE HE

02:38:42.212 --> 02:38:43.981
IS THAT EACH OF THE ENTITIES

02:38:44.047 --> 02:38:45.782
RESPONSIBLE FOR HAS FLUCTUATED

02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:47.684
QUITE A BIT IN RECENT YEARS.

02:38:47.751 --> 02:38:49.219
AND ACCORDINGLY WORKLOAD COULD

02:38:49.286 --> 02:38:51.188
BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ASSUMED

02:38:51.255 --> 02:38:53.190
BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:55.158
ADDITION AS WAS REFERENCED- THE

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:56.693
NEW STRUCTURE COULD CHANGE THE

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:58.495
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES NEEDED ON

02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:00.430
THE ONE HAND- THE NEW STRUCTURE

02:39:00.497 --> 02:39:02.399
COULD CREATE EFFICIENCIES OVER

02:39:02.466 --> 02:39:04.568
TIME. THAT WILL WORK WITH THAT

02:39:04.635 --> 02:39:05.702
WOULD REDUCE OVERALL NEED FOR

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:07.271
RESOURCES AND ON THE OTHER HAND

02:39:07.337 --> 02:39:08.939
IT COULD INCREASE THE NEED FOR

02:39:09.006 --> 02:39:10.707
RESOURCES PARTICULARLY IF THE

02:39:10.774 --> 02:39:12.943

02:46:17.267 --> 02:46:18.935
DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR COHORT

02:46:19.002 --> 02:46:20.036
TWO AND THAT'S A COMPETITIVE

02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:22.072
PROCESS. VERY GOOD IF I COULD

02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:24.674
GET A COPY OF THAT INFORMATION

02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:26.343
THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC JUST TO

02:46:26.409 --> 02:46:27.310
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:28.812
WHAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

02:46:28.878 --> 02:46:29.713
THOSE RESOURCES AND WHERE

02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:31.981
THEY'RE GOING TO THAT WOULD I

02:46:32.048 --> 02:46:36.486
WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT- IN

02:46:36.553 --> 02:46:39.356
AND I'M JUST KIND OF ON GENERAL

02:46:39.422 --> 02:46:42.459
PRINCIPLE- I'M A BIG BELIEVER

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.661
IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:46.763
CONSOLIDATIONS OR THE PROCESS

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:48.665
THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:49.199
TO GO THROUGH THAT LITTLE

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:51.768
HOOVER COMMISSION- IT'S HARD TO

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:53.236
DO CONSOLIDATIONS THROUGH THE

02:46:53.303 --> 02:46:56.172

02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:58.174
OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

02:46:58.241 --> 02:46:59.442
IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT

02:47:06.383 --> 02:47:08.518
TRADITIONAL LEGISLATIVE POLICY

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:11.054

02:47:11.121 --> 02:47:12.389
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

02:47:12.455 --> 02:47:14.657
