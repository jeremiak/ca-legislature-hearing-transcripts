QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU TOUCHED ON.

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.921
IS THAT BECAUSE ONCE THE

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:18.322
ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.256
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS REMOVED

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:21.325
FROM THE ACT. THEN AS

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:22.526
JURISDICTIONS ARE TRYING TO

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:24.128
DEAL WITH SHORT TERM RENTALS

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.564
WITH ANY OTHER WARDENS THE

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.798

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.600
THOSE POTENTIAL ORDINANCES

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:32.970
THROUGH THE LENS. OF ACCESS AND

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.638
VISITOR SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.774

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:39.343
LOCAL HOUSING. THIS IS WHAT.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.278
THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:42.813
GET THE COMMISSION TO

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.315
APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER. THE

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:46.283
IMPACT OF HOUSING ON A LOT OF

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.519
THE OTHER DECISIONS THAT THAT

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.354
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE MAKING.

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.722
IT WAS TOO BAD THAT THIS WAS

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.357
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. BECAUSE

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:55.292
THAT THAT IMBALANCES REALLY

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.927
SHOWED OVER THE YEARS AS LOCAL

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:57.661
JURISDICTIONS ARE TYING TO

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.463
PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS TRY TO

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.899
PROTECT HOUSING. AND ESTABLISH

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:02.900
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.135
APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:04.835
THIS I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.637
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. THANK YOU

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.838
SOME NUMBERS THAT I WITNESSED

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:08.739
AS WELL TOO WHEN I SERVED ON

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.107
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE LAST FOUR

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.742
YEARS AND- AND SO THIS IS AN

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.077
AUTHOR SPONSORED BILL I SEE TO

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.679
CORRECT THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:19.183
TO MOVE WILL. THANK YOU. HAVE A

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.951
QUESTION. SMITH THANK YOU HAVE

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:22.119
A CERTAIN TRYING TO GET A GREAT

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:23.788
ON SOME OF THE MAYBE THE

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:25.756
COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM HAVING

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.258
ANOTHER LAYER OF APPROVAL

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.994
PROCESS. AND MR STONE BROUGHT

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.529
UP A GOOD POINT IN THAT'S THE

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:35.166
COASTAL ACCESS POINT. OF I

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:37.201
GUESS MY QUESTION IS SO. IS

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.969
THIS BILL MEANT TO ALLOW THE

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:42.039
COASTAL COMMISSION TO SAVE THAT

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.474
TO THE BUNGALOWS THAT ARE ON

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:46.243
THE SIDE YOU KNOW ON YOU KNOW

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.112
IN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:49.613
BECAUSE THOSE BUNGALOWS EVEN

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.915
THOUGH THEY'RE SMALL IN

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.050
STATURE- THEY COME WITH A

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:55.386
MIGHTY PRICE TAG. SO NINETY

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.487
PRICE TAG IS UP YOU KNOW

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:59.023
SOMEBODY OWNS THAT AND ALTHOUGH

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:01.859
IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A-

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:02.459
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:03.894
JACKETS ACTUALLY IF IT'S ON THE

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.930
STRAND IN MANHATTAN BEACH IT'S

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:06.530
A SIX MILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:09.466
PROPERTY. AND WOULD THIS

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.802
RESTRICT THEM. WITH THIS MAKE

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.070
THEM HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.538
PROVE THAT THEY'RE DOING SOME

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:16.907
OF THESE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.342
THEIR LAND OR SELL THEIR LAND

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.612
IN LETTER DEVELOPER BUILD WHAT

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:22.146
THEY'RE GONNA BUILD THERE

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.481
BECAUSE- ALSO LAND ITSELF. IS

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:26.283
WHERE THE- THAT THAT'S WHERE

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.751
THE COST IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.119
RIGHT AS A MEMBER C. R. DOES SO

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:31.121
THE ANSWERS ARE YES AND NO- IT

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:32.756
DOESN'T. SO NATURALLY OCCURRING

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.191
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOME OF THE

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.526
OLDER STRUCTURES THAT ARE THERE

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:37.862
MIGHT STILL. BE AVAILABLE FOR

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.096
SLIGHTLY CHEAPER RENT BUT SO

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.030
SHOULD SOMEBODY WANT TO

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:42.233
REDEVELOP THE PROPERTY- THEY

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.434
THEY PROBABLY GOING TO BE DOING

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.034
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:45.669
LUXURY LITTLE MORE HIGH VALUE.

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.538
WHAT THIS COULD ALLOW FOR IS

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.505
THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:50.074
COASTAL COMMISSION IN ADDITION

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.742
TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTION TO

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.477
MAKE SURE THAT THE NET NUMBER

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.745
OF UNITS THAT WERE THERE THE

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:57.181
NATURALLY CURL FOR LOWER INCOME

00:41:57.248 --> 00:42:00.818
OR LOWER RENTAL. PROPERTIES ARE

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.286
SOMEHOW RETAINED. I'M I JUST

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.421
FEAR THAT THE- PRICES AT THE

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:07.858
BEACH OUR OUR ON THE COASTAL.

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:10.995
SECTION OF THE STATE ARE ARE

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.164
SIMPLY OUT OF THE CONTROL OF

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:16.200
GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S MORE OF

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.836
A MARKETING ISSUE- I DON'T

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:19.937
THINK THERE'S ANY WAY TO MAKE

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:21.605
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT IN THE

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:24.108
COAST AREA AND SO I'M NOT QUITE

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:27.711
SURE WHAT ADDING THIS LAYER- OF

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:30.581
PROCESS TO. MAKE EXISTING

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:31.382
DEVELOPMENT DOWN THERE IT'S

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:33.384
GOING TO HELP YOU KNOW THIS

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.119
SUBSIDY BUILDING AFFORDABLE

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.655
PROJECT DOWN THERE THERE'S GOT

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.823
TO BE HUGE. AND THEN WHEN YOU

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.325
GET PAST THE BUILDING COSTS AS

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.093
SOON AS THE THINGS THAT. YOU

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.662
KNOW THAT PROPERTY IS WORTH WAY

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.497
MORE THAN YOU BOUGHT IT EVEN IF

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:48.232
YOU DEED RESTRICTED I AGREE

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.099
WITH YOU THERE'S A LOT OF

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:50.834
MARKET BASED- CONSIDERATIONS

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.503
THAT GO INTO THE HOUSING-

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.071
HOUSING PRICING- BUT IT'S NOT

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:55.406
ALWAYS A SUBSIDY RELATED

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:57.141
SOLUTIONS THIS ALSO CAN BE ABLE

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.842
TO PROMOTE. SOME CONVERSATIONS

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.377
THAT OFFER INCENTIVE BASED

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.012
SOLUTIONS TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.081
OR EVEN DEVELOP MORE MIXED

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:05.115
INCOME MIXED AFFORDABLE

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:07.051
HOUSING- IN ADDITION TO MARKET

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.619
RATE HOUSING. WELL THEY THEY

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:10.521
TAXPAYERS THAT SUBSIDIZE THAT

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:11.588
NEED TO GET THE BANG FOR THEIR

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:12.389
BUCK AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.657
GET AT THE COAST THAT'S WHAT

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.459
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT I SEE THE

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:18.562
WITNESS HAS. A POTENTIAL.

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.431
QUESTION ANSWERS TO MY QUESTION

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:21.498
WITH WITH THE CHAIR IN THE

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:22.766
AUTHOR'S PERMISSION ASSEMBLY

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.768
MEMBER SEATTLE. I'M THE AUTHOR

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.270
WOULD YOU LIKE HER TO CONTEST

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.338
THANK YOU WANT TO COME AND GO

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:28.672
HEAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD I

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.807
WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:31.041
COMMISSION IN ITS FIFTY YEAR

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.142
HISTORY HAS NEVER DENIED AN

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:33.978
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. SO

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.312
I JUST WANT TO GET THAT ON

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:37.014
THERE FOR THE RECORD. BUT WE'RE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.350
WE'RE THIS BILL. IF THE CALLS

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.918
ON IS PRIMARILY BUILT OUT NOW

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:43.087
IS. RECOGNIZE AND THERE'S A LOT

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:44.688
OF EXPENSIVE HOUSING THERE.

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.490
WHERE THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.826
HAVE THE MOST BENEFIT TODAY IS

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.327
THAT IN THE LOCAL COASTAL

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.695
PROGRAMS THAT ARE PREPARED BY

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.297
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE TO

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.765
BE CERTIFIED BY THE COASTAL

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:55.866
COMMISSION. WHEN THEY'RE BEING

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:57.267
PREPARED OR WEIRD WHEN THEY'RE

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:59.670
BEING AMENDED. THOSE ARE THE

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:01.638
INSTRUMENTS THAT- DESIGNATE THE

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.907
ZONING AREAS THE DENSITY THAT

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.909
TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT THE VARIOUS

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:08.846
PROCESSES THAT HAVE TO BE- GONE

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.047
THROUGH IN ORDER TO GET YOUR

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:12.282
PERMITS. AT THAT STAGE RIGHT

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:14.485
NOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.187
NO AUTHORITY. TO WORK WITH

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.555
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.557
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR MAKE

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.659
THAT PROCESS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:23.827
PEOPLE. BECAUSE WERE

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.529
SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED FROM

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.431
EVEN CONSIDERING AFFORDABLE

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.465
HOUSING IN THESE LAND USE PLANS

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:29.900
WHICH IS ABSURD. BECAUSE THE

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.435
COST LOOKS STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.470
HAS MOVED FAR FAR BEYOND WHERE

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.738
THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN

00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.707
REQUIRED TO STAY. THIS WOULD

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.375
GIVE US ADDITIONAL SEAT AT THE

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.444
TABLE ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE IF

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.779
YOU WILL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:43.113
THAT MAY NOT BE QUITE AS

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.448
COMMITTED AS WE WOULD LIKE THEM

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.582
TO BE TO PROVIDING AFFORDABLE

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.985
HOUSING. TO GET BETTER LAND USE

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.753
PLANS TO GET BETTER ZONING MAPS

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.822
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BECAUSE AT

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.857
THIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA. MOST

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:55.325
OF THE STATE MOST OF THE

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.061
COASTAL ZONE IS OPERATING UNDER

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:59.063
CERTIFIED LCP WE'RE NOT ISSUING

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:00.431
THE PERMITS ANYMORE. SO IT

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.332
WOULDN'T BE ANOTHER LAYER OF

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.401
BUREAUCRACY FOR APPROVAL IT

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.536
WOULD SIMPLY BE MAKING SURE

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:06.870
THAT THE NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT'S

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.806
GOING FORWARD. ACTUALLY REFER

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:10.607
REFLECTS THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.109
PRIORITY TO PROVIDE FOR MORE

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:13.777
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN SOME OF

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:19.283
THESE LEAST AFFORDABLE AREAS I

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:20.050
BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO-

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:20.884
THERE'D THERE OFFICIALS ARE

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.286
DIRECT OR- FOR THE PEOPLE TO

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.887
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. IN

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:27.057
IN THEIR DISTRICT. AND BUT I

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:28.792
THINK THAT VOICE IS BETTER

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.527
HEARD BY THE PEOPLE THEY

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:33.831
REPRESENT THAT COMMUNITY. AND I

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:34.865
THINK THERE IS A LIMITED

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.733
ABILITY I USED TO LIVE DOWN AND

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.935
IN THE BEACH AREA THAT'S WHY

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:39.837
KNOW ABOUT MANHATTAN BEACH- BUT

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:40.671
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:43.807
SINGLE- I HAD MOVED INLAND. IF

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.042
I COULD AFFORD TO LIVE DOWN

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:46.143
THERE AND I NEVER DREAMED THAT

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.478
I'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD I DON'T I

00:45:47.544 --> 00:45:51.081
CAN'T STILL. SO ANYWAY. THAT'S

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:52.583
A LIFESTYLE CHANGE YOU MAKE

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.751
BECAUSE OF THE IN AFFORDABILITY

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:56.487
OF BEING AT THE BEACH I DON'T

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:57.121
SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.656
MORE AFFORDABLE. AND I THINK

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:02.159
CITY COUNCILS NEED TO BE ABLE

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:04.695
TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT- IF

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.063
THEY'RE GOING TO I JUST DON'T

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.364
UNDERSTAND HOW THE COASTAL

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.233
COMMISSION. AND THE STATE

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.168
ENTERING INTO CITY COUNCIL

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.436
COASTAL CITIES ARE GOING TO

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.438
HELP FIX THAT WE'RE LOSING

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:15.506
DENSITY IN THE COASTAL ZONE

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.707
BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.542
APPROVING DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.544
THAT ARE. THAT ARE DEMOLISHING

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.813
EXISTING DUPLEXES TRIPLEXES AND

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.715
FOUR PLEXUS THEY MAY NOT BE

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:27.184
CHEAP. BUT IN THE COASTAL ZONE

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:28.785
THEY ARE THE MOST AFFORDABLE

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:29.720
HOUSING THAT IS CURRENTLY

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.488
AVAILABLE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:33.090
ARE APPROVING THEIR DEMOLITION.

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.791
AND REPLACING THEM WITH GIANT

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.493
STATEMENT HOMES SO WE'RE

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.695
ACTUALLY LOSING RESIDENTIAL

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:40.497
UNITS IN THE COASTAL ZONE

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.065
BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.467
APPROVE THAT UNDER THE MELLOW

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.102
ACT FROM FORTY YEARS AGO THERE

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.337
EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED. TO

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:48.739
APPROVE THE DEMOLITION OF

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.974
EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS AND-

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:51.808
TAKE THEM OUT OF THE COASTAL

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.311
ZONE. THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:56.446
THE COMMISSION TO STOP AT LEAST

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:57.814
TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING I

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:58.916
WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NO

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.651
EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:03.320
ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA. AND

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.155
AND I ALSO ARGUED THAT IF WE'RE

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.723
LOSING A LITTLE BIT OF DENSITY

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.091
IN THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD HELP

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.993
TRAFFIC A WHOLE LOT. BECAUSE

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.762
THERE'S H. EXTREME AMOUNT OF

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.797
TRAFFIC IN THOSE AREAS. IT'LL

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:14.865
TAKE YOU THREE HOURS TO GET

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:19.703
FROM SANTA MONICA DOWN. TO

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.772
REDONDO BEACH SO. ANYWAY- I

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:22.472

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:23.440
WHAT I NEED TO HEAR AND I. YOUR

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.842
EFFORTS THANKS. THANK YOU ANY

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.177
OTHER QUESTIONS MR STONE YEAH I

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.312
WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THIS

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.480
IS ACTUALLY A MAJOR TOOL FOR

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:33.283
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.751
TO DEAL WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.787
IN THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM.

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:39.056
BECAUSE ONCE AT THE L. C. P. IS

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.657
TO GO TO WITH THE COMMISSION IT

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.826
BECOMES THE STANDARD OF REVIEW.

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:45.362
IF THE L. C. P. AND THAT LOCAL

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.231
JURISDICTIONS CANNOT ACCOUNT

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.199
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND DO

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:50.234
THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO DO

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.237
DEALING WITH. WITH THE SHORT

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.671
TERM RENTALS DEALING WITH A

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.206
MYRIAD OF THINGS THAT LOCAL

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.641
JURISDICTIONS ARE DEALING WITH

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.943
ALONG THE COAST MY JURISDICTION

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.445
CASE IN POINT WE DO HAVE SOME

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.547
AFFORDABILITY. WHEN PEBBLE

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:06.450
BEACH VERY VERY HIGH END WANTED

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:09.586
TO BUILD SOME. SOME HOUSING

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.421
THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:12.122
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WAS

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.824
ACTUALLY BUILT IT TO THAT

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.226
PARTICULAR PROJECT SO THAT

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:18.428
BECAUSE OF THE WILLINGNESS OF

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:20.163
PEBBLE BEACH AND THE LOCAL

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.065
COMMUNITY REALLY PUSHING ON IT

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:24.001
THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.937
EXACTLY THAT CONVERSATION SO

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:27.537
WE'RE REALLY MISSING THE POINT

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.940
HERE. IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:32.009
HOW THE COMMISSION INTERACTS

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:33.343
WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HOW

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.779
ELSE HE PEES ARE CREATED. AND

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.214
THAT THE AMOUNT OF CONTROL THAT

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.149
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE OVER

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.817
THOSE DECISIONS THIS IS A BILL

00:48:40.884 --> 00:48:43.220
THAT GIVES THEM. THE BREADTH OF

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:44.354
THAT CONTROL DEALING WITH

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.356
HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT THAT

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.325
WILL IMPACT HOUSING IN THEIR

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.060

MISTER WOULD. THANK YOU THAT

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.276
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO MAKE A

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:38.513
MOTION ON THIS BILL. I JUST

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.782
WANT TO- TALK TO THE AUTHOR I

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:41.983
KNOW THAT HE'S THOUGHT ABOUT

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.852
THIS AND WAS VERY DELIBERATE

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:44.719
AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.921
ISSUE. AND THAT THIS WAS A VERY

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.490
CONTROVERSIAL WHEN I WHEN THIS

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:49.924
WAS PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.826
AGO I REMEMBER THAT. IT WAS

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.695
THAT A DEBATE WERE ON THE FLOOR

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:54.963
OF ONE OF THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.898
OF THE TIME MISTER CAR DOES NOT

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:57.999
CONGRESS MEMBER I REMEMBER HE

01:23:58.066 --> 01:23:59.768
BROKE DOWN IN TEARS. TALKING

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:02.637
ABOUT HOW HIS DAD- WAS A- A

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.439
GARDENER AND HE WAS GONNA HAVE

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.074
HIS TOOLS ESSENTIALLY TAKEN

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:06.975
AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE THAT

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.810
WOULD HAVE BANNED THEM. ON DAY

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.044
ONE AND SO WHAT YOU'RE

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.646
PROPOSING HERE IS VERY

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.581
DIFFERENT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:15.183
THE INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.051
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TWENTY

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.354
FIVE YEARS- SO I DON'T THINK

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.055
THIS IS THAT AND REASONABLE I

01:24:21.122 --> 01:24:22.123
KNOW THERE WAS LATE OPPOSITION

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:24.025
THAT CAME I THINK JUST TWO DAYS

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.027
AGO YESTERDAY SO- WE HAVEN'T

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.328
REALLY HEARD FROM PEOPLE THE

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:29.297
OUTCRY LIKE WE DID TWENTY FIVE

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:32.167
YEARS AGO. AND JUST THIS

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.302
WEEKEND I WAS IN THE HOME DEPOT

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.304
STORE AND I KNEW ABOUT THIS

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:36.905
BILL AND I WAS LOOKING ON THE

01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:40.942
SHELF. AND THE PRICE OF THESE-

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.845
ELECTRIC BLOWERS HAS GONE DOWN

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:44.446
AND WE'RE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.214
BLOWERS I KNOW. THERE'S

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.382
CHAINSAWS AND LAWNMOWERS AND

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.050
OPENNESS TO WOOD TALKS ABOUT

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:49.984
CHAINSAWS A LOT UP IN CERTAIN

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.252
PARTS OF THE STATE WHICH ARE

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.353
NEEDED BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.322
BUT- THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE FACE

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.757
IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THE LEAF

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:56.991
BLOWERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:58.560
AN THAT'S WHAT IMPACTS. AND

01:24:58.626 --> 01:24:59.994
NEIGHBORHOODS THE QUALITY OF

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:03.665
LIFE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.432
HEALTH OF THE WORKERS. THEY TWO

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.568
THINGS. ONE I SAW THIS ON THE

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.403
SHELF IN IN HOME DEPOT THE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.438
POWER OF THESE LEAF BLOWERS HAS

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:11.272
GONE UP TREATMENT YOU'RE

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:12.607
TREMENDOUSLY I THINK IT'S THE

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.242
CF AT WHATEVER THE HORSEPOWER

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:16.845
WHAT HAVE YOU. AND I AND I I'M

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:17.679
A ROBOT ONE ABOUT A YEAR AGO

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:18.446
WAS LIKE WELL THIS IS ALMOST

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:21.049
LIKE A GAS CARD ONE AND- THE

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:22.784
PRICE WAS NOT THAT MUCH WHAT'S

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.720
THE PRICE IS MUCH LOWER THAN A

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.555
GAS WANTS TO BE LOOK AT BUYING

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:28.890
ONE OF THESE PLUS BUYING AN

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.459
EXTRA BATTERY PACK OR TWO. IT'S

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:32.360
ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT OF THE

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:36.498
COST FOR- AND- I GUESS ONE AND

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.732
YOU WANT WITH THE GAS ONE

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.133
YOU'RE PAYING GAS OF COURSE

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.002
HERE YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR GAS

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.237
YOU SAVE MONEY AND HAVE THE

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.506
ELECTRIC BUT I DON'T THINK IT

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.341
WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.976
ON THE QUALITY AND I'M

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:48.910
UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'RE GOING

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.745
TO HAVE THERE IS SOME TYPE OF A

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.146
REBATE PROGRAM THAT CARP YOU

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:53.815

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.984
WHAT WE DO- WHAT THE BILL DOES

01:25:56.050 --> 01:26:03.057

HELP BUSINESSES TRANSITION TO

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:10.031
ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT- AND

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.566
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- IN THE

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:13.067
BILL THAT ISN'T. IN CARBS

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.335
PROPOSED REGULATION SO THAT'S

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.637
SOMETHING UNIQUE TO THE BILL

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:16.437

CITY. BUT THE AIR QUALITY IS

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:54.548
ALSO DIFFERENT IN IN YOUR BILL-

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.417
TO DIVE A LITTLE MORE INTO

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:59.053

THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:07.628
THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.163
MENTIONED LIKE KARL MOYER IN

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.631
THESE OTHER THINGS I KNOW VERY

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:12.133
FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I WORKED

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:15.336

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.262
BIG ENOUGH THING. IT'S GOING TO

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.696

LOT OF MONEY. THE SAME

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.064
COMPANIES THAT MAKE THE GAS

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.198
POWERED EQUIPMENT ALSO MAKE THE

01:38:58.265 --> 01:38:59.667
ELECTRIC POWERED EQUIPMENT SO

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:02.202
IT'S THE SAME COMPANIES-

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:02.703

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.340
PUT IT IN AND YOU KIND OF TRY

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:09.643
TO MINIMIZE. THE IMPACT OF

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:10.110
STORE EMISSIONS ON THE

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:13.080

FORWARD TO HAVING MORE

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.282
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ABOUT

THIS IS- LIKE I MENTIONED IN

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.687
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DALY

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:20.788
EMISSIONS FROM STORE ARE

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:22.556
PROJECTED TO SURPASS. THOSE

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.425
FROM PASSENGER CARS. I THINK

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.060
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL I

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.328
THINK THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:27.795
ON SOMETHING THAT THE

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.430
LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS- YOU

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:30.564
TALK ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPACT

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:35.669
OF THINGS. I THINK THERE'S NO

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:36.203
BIGGER LONG TERM IMPACT ON

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.972
CLIMATE CHANGE. AN THEN AND

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.074

OF THE DEVON AIR QUALITY

01:41:17.037 --> 01:41:19.640
DISTRICTS- AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.809

THAT. MISTER SERRA. THANK YOU.

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:29.016
ARE SO I THINK OF YOU HAVE

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:32.085
HEARD FROM- THE COLLECTION OF.

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.288
ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE-

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:35.722
DIFFERENT AREAS HAVE DIFFERENT

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:39.026
REQUIREMENTS AND- CITIES OUT IN

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:39.827
RURAL AREAS HAVE MUCH

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:42.796
DIFFERENT- ENVIRONMENTS- THEN

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:46.467
THEY DO AND ABILITIES TO TRYING

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:49.303
UC'S EQUIPMENT- I MYSELF HAVE A

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:51.305
COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE AND

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:53.273
SOMETIMES ONE PIECE OF COURT

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.575
AND THAT'S WORK I SWITCHED TO

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:58.011
THE OTHER ONE- I GO THROUGH BAD.

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:00.047
A LOT WHICH CONCERNS ME. AND

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:01.849
BUT YOU KNOWONE OF THE THINGS

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:05.986
THAT I KNOW EXISTS TODAY. IS

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:06.587
THAT LOCAL AGENCIES COMMUNITY

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:10.123
CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES. HAVE

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:10.691
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:12.993
THESE IF THEY WANT. AND SO I

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.127
THINK IT'S REALLY MORE OF A

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:16.697
LOCAL CONTROL THING THAT I

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:17.931
THINK LOCAL LOCALITIES SHOULD

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:20.133
DETERMINE- WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.268
AREA WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:24.972
WORKERS. AND YOU KNOW AND ALLOW

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:27.140
THEM TO DO THAT- AND I WOULD

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:29.276
HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW AS WE DROP

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:31.512
THE EMISSIONS ON CARS YES

01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:33.780
INDIVIDUALLY THE CARS WILL BE

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:36.049
SO LOW THAT ANYTHING ELSE AND

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:36.783
IT PRODUCES ANYTHING WILL BE

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:40.354
HIGHER. AND AND SO- YEAH I

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.188
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:42.723
COLLATERAL DAMAGE BUT THIS WITH

01:42:42.789 --> 01:42:44.925
THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION- WE

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.127
ALL WANT CLEAN AIR- BUT- YOU

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:48.395
KNOW I THINK BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:52.933
THERE'S A LOT. OF LIVELIHOODS

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:53.534
THAT DEPEND ON THIS THAT. THEY

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.535
CAN BE IN. SO- THAT THOSE ARE

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:57.137
MY- OKAY. THAT AND I USED TO

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.238
SERVE ON A CITY COUNCIL PALO

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:01.241
ALTO WITH THAT BAND- GAS

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.477
POWERED LEAF BLOWERS IN IT I

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:04.311
DID TALK TO. THIS IS A LITTLE

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.680
DIFFERENT. BECAUSE I'M NOT

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.382
TRYING TO BAN THE USE. YOU KNOW

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:09.516
COME A CERTAIN DATE I'M SAYING

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.385
LET'S BAN THE SALE OF NEW ONES-

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:13.020
BUT BUTI APPRECIATE THE POINT

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:15.389
ON THE LOCAL CONTROL- FRONT

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:17.824
AND- YOU KNOW IS. THAT WE'RE

01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:19.493
TRYING TO CRAFT A BILL THAT NEW

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.460
WANTS ENOUGH TO ADDRESS ALL THE

LANDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO THE

01:47:56.336 --> 01:47:57.504

01:47:57.571 --> 01:47:59.472
INTO NON CONTIGUOUS SQUARE MILE

01:47:59.539 --> 01:48:01.908

GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:18.058
THE PROBLEM UNDER EXISTING LAW

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.025
IS THAT THE COMMISSION IS

THE 5% CAP ON THESE EXPENSES

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:42.916
THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE

DOWN TO FIVE PERCENT. AND SO

02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:06.723
OBVIOUSLY AT 80% THEY THOUGHT

04:17:20.691 --> 04:17:22.894
WE WANT TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN

04:17:22.960 --> 04:17:25.797
AND IT YOU KNOW CREATING AND

04:17:25.863 --> 04:17:27.532
THAT THE CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND

04:17:27.598 --> 04:17:28.699
ENERGY POLL ARE THEY

04:17:28.766 --> 04:17:32.370
ENVIRONMENTAL PUSH- TO GET TO

04:17:32.436 --> 04:17:35.573
ZERO EMISSIONS- IF. IN AN EARLY

04:17:35.640 --> 04:17:36.874
RETIREMENT WIND ENERGY AND

04:17:36.941 --> 04:17:39.410
LOSING OUR- LOSING TO THE EAST

04:17:39.477 --> 04:17:41.879
COAST. LOSING THAT TECHNOLOGY

04:17:41.946 --> 04:17:44.715
OVER THERE- IF WE'RE GOING TO

04:17:44.782 --> 04:17:45.917
LEAD IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE

04:17:45.983 --> 04:17:46.984
IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE

04:17:47.051 --> 04:17:48.986
THE REST OF THE WORLD. NEEDS

04:17:49.053 --> 04:17:51.322
THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THEY'RE

04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:52.390
NOT GOING TO DO WHAT WE'RE

04:17:52.456 --> 04:17:54.826
GOING TO TRY TO DO IN TWENTY

04:17:54.892 --> 04:17:58.696
FORTY FIVE. AND SO. IF THEY'RE

04:17:58.763 --> 04:18:00.097
DEPENDING ON US TO DEVELOP THE

04:18:00.164 --> 04:18:01.766
TECHNOLOGY BUT WORSHIPING THAT

04:18:01.833 --> 04:18:04.001
WE'RE DISINCENTIVE ICING THE

04:18:04.068 --> 04:18:06.370
TECHNOLOGY. HOW ARE E GOING

04:18:06.437 --> 04:18:09.674
TO. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THE

04:18:09.740 --> 04:18:12.543
REST OF THE WORLD ON BOARD WITH

04:18:12.610 --> 04:18:13.811
THE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THEY

04:18:13.878 --> 04:18:15.713
NEED. TO TRY TO REDUCE THE

04:18:15.780 --> 04:18:18.115
EMISSIONS BECAUSE WE CAN DO AS

04:18:18.182 --> 04:18:19.917
MUCH WE CAN ALL GET TO ZERO

04:18:19.984 --> 04:18:21.819
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF

04:18:21.886 --> 04:18:23.221
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT

04:18:23.287 --> 04:18:25.256
DOING IT EITHER. ARE NOT NOT

04:18:25.323 --> 04:18:29.360
ABLE TO DO IT- WORKS WE KNOW

04:18:29.427 --> 04:18:31.028
WHAT IT IS WE ALL BREATHE THE

04:18:31.095 --> 04:18:34.432
SAME AIR. SO WHAT WHAT IS THE

04:18:34.498 --> 04:18:35.933
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER TO THOSE

04:18:36.000 --> 04:18:37.802
CONCERNS THAT YOU HEARD OUT

04:18:37.869 --> 04:18:38.703
THERE BECAUSE THIS CREATES

04:18:38.769 --> 04:18:41.706
JOBS. AND YOU KNOW THE

04:18:41.772 --> 04:18:43.507
MANUFACTURING LORD KNOWS WE

04:18:43.574 --> 04:18:45.309
NEED IT HERE. YOU KNOW WE TALK

04:18:45.376 --> 04:18:46.944
ABOUT RAISING PEOPLE OUT OF

04:18:47.011 --> 04:18:48.312
POVERTY THEY NEED JOBS TO DO

04:18:48.379 --> 04:18:52.416
THAT. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY

04:18:52.483 --> 04:18:54.418
CONCERN IS THAT 10% THANK YOU

04:18:54.485 --> 04:18:55.887
MISTER SURCHARGE SO I.

04:18:55.953 --> 04:18:58.656
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I

04:18:58.723 --> 04:18:59.290
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE

04:18:59.357 --> 04:19:03.728
EVERYONE- THAT SPOKE OF- BOTH

04:19:03.794 --> 04:19:07.732
FOR AND AGAINST- THIS BILL- AND-

04:19:07.798 --> 04:19:09.533
NO EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE

04:19:09.600 --> 04:19:12.503
OF. THE INNOVATION IN THE

04:19:12.570 --> 04:19:13.170
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

04:19:13.237 --> 04:19:18.643
SPACE- THIS BILL. BUT DOES NOT.

04:19:18.709 --> 04:19:21.879
CREATE ANY CAPS FOR CARBON

04:19:21.946 --> 04:19:25.216
CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THE

04:19:25.283 --> 04:19:27.885
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS

04:19:27.952 --> 04:19:31.923
CEATED THIS FALSE NARRATIVE OF.

04:19:31.989 --> 04:19:34.992
YOU KNOW OUR ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE

04:19:35.059 --> 04:19:37.228
GUIDANCE AND FRAMEWORK TO THE

04:19:37.295 --> 04:19:40.731
AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO PLACE

04:19:40.798 --> 04:19:41.799
YOU KNOW THE OVERWHELMING

04:19:41.866 --> 04:19:45.469
EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR GROSS

04:19:45.536 --> 04:19:48.005
EMISSION REDUCTIONS YOU KNOW

04:19:48.072 --> 04:19:49.106
TO FOCUS ON THIS FALSE

04:19:49.173 --> 04:19:51.976
NARRATIVE QUITE FRANKLY THAT

04:19:52.043 --> 04:19:55.012
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO. CAP

04:19:55.079 --> 04:19:56.514
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN

04:19:56.580 --> 04:20:02.320
FACT. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FOR

04:20:02.386 --> 04:20:04.088
THE INNOVATION I MEAN IF- IF

04:20:04.155 --> 04:20:06.724
CALIFORNIA CAN DEVELOP THE BIG

04:20:06.791 --> 04:20:08.693
CARBON VACUUM THAT CAN SUCK UP

04:20:08.759 --> 04:20:10.127
ALL THE CARBON IN OUR

04:20:10.194 --> 04:20:12.163
ATMOSPHERE THEN MORE POWER TO

04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:14.565
THEM THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS

04:20:14.632 --> 04:20:17.268
BILL THAT LIMITS THE CARBON

04:20:17.335 --> 04:20:20.204
CAPTURE STORAGE CONTRIBUTION TO

04:20:20.271 --> 04:20:23.507
THE- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS

04:20:23.574 --> 04:20:25.276
THROUGH CARBON CAPTURE AND IN

04:20:25.343 --> 04:20:26.043
FACT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY

04:20:26.110 --> 04:20:29.146
CLEAR- WE HAVE ACCEPTED ONE OF

04:20:29.213 --> 04:20:30.781
THE AMENDMENTS EVERY ACCEPTED

04:20:30.848 --> 04:20:31.682
FROM THE COMMITTEE THE

04:20:31.749 --> 04:20:33.417
COMMITTEES- THANK THE CHAIRS

04:20:33.484 --> 04:20:36.153
SIX. RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT WAS

04:20:36.220 --> 04:20:38.122
TO TAKE OUT THAT 10% LANGUAGE

04:20:38.189 --> 04:20:41.692
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S CLEARLY-

04:20:41.759 --> 04:20:43.427
BEEN MISTER INTERPRETED AND

04:20:43.494 --> 04:20:45.429
USED. TO CREATE THIS FALSE

04:20:45.496 --> 04:20:46.364
NARRATIVE THEY WERE TRYING TO

04:20:46.430 --> 04:20:48.299
CAPTURE THE CARBON CAPTURE SO

04:20:48.366 --> 04:20:51.035
WE ARE TAKING OUT THAT 10% CAP-

04:20:51.102 --> 04:20:53.804
THAT THAT 10% LANGUAGE. BUT

04:20:53.871 --> 04:20:55.740
THAT THE MAIN POINT IS THIS

04:20:55.806 --> 04:20:57.742
THAT IN ORDER TO REACH CARBON

04:20:57.808 --> 04:21:00.177
NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

04:21:00.244 --> 04:21:03.481
WE NEED TO. DRAMATICALLY REDUCE

04:21:03.547 --> 04:21:06.183
EMISSIONS THAT IS WHAT- A

04:21:06.250 --> 04:21:09.053
RECENT AARP STUDY ON ON HOW TO

04:21:09.120 --> 04:21:11.155
ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BUT

04:21:11.222 --> 04:21:12.823
TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AS THEY THEY

04:21:12.890 --> 04:21:14.792
EXPLORED THREE DIFFERENT

04:21:14.859 --> 04:21:18.129
SCENARIOS BETWEEN YOU KNOW 90%

04:21:18.195 --> 04:21:21.232
OVER 90% REDUCTIONS 2280%

04:21:21.298 --> 04:21:23.934
REDUCTIONS BUT IN ANY CASE. YOU

04:21:24.001 --> 04:21:26.537
KNOW EVERY. CREDIBLE FEASIBLE

04:21:26.604 --> 04:21:28.739
STUDY THAT IS FOCUSED ON HOW WE

04:21:28.806 --> 04:21:31.475
GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

04:21:31.542 --> 04:21:32.076
TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHETHER THE

04:21:32.143 --> 04:21:33.611
COMMISSION THAT THE STUDY

04:21:33.677 --> 04:21:34.912
RECENTLY COMMISSIONED BY THE A

04:21:34.979 --> 04:21:37.014
RP OR WHETHER STUDIES

04:21:37.081 --> 04:21:38.983
COMMISSIONED AND EUROPE. HAVE

04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:42.520
ALL FOCUSED ON. MODELS WHERE WE

04:21:42.586 --> 04:21:44.455
CAN ONLY ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IF

04:21:44.522 --> 04:21:47.091
WE FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR GROSS

04:21:47.158 --> 04:21:48.793
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THE MAIN

04:21:48.859 --> 04:21:51.195
POINT OF THIS IS THAT WE CANNOT

04:21:51.262 --> 04:21:53.064
ALLOW CARBON CAPTURE AND

04:21:53.130 --> 04:21:56.967
STORAGE. AS AN EXCUSE. IN ORDER

04:21:57.034 --> 04:21:59.270
TO KEEP BURNING FOSSIL FUELS WE

04:21:59.336 --> 04:22:01.772
NEED TO MAKE THOSE. THAT THAT

04:22:01.839 --> 04:22:03.541
DRAMATIC TRANSITION THAT IS THE

04:22:03.607 --> 04:22:06.010
ONLY WAY- QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE

04:22:06.077 --> 04:22:08.612
CAN SAVE OUR PLANET. OKAY WELL

04:22:08.679 --> 04:22:12.383
THAT'S DRAMATIC- AND- BUT I

04:22:12.450 --> 04:22:13.851
GUESS I HAVE TO SAY IT YOU CAN

04:22:13.918 --> 04:22:16.053
REMOVE THE 10% LANGUAGE BUT IF

04:22:16.120 --> 04:22:18.022
YOU LEAVE THE 90% LANGUAGE ALL

04:22:18.089 --> 04:22:19.757
THAT LEAVES IS 10% AND THAT

04:22:19.824 --> 04:22:21.225
REMOVES THE INCENTIVE FOR

04:22:21.292 --> 04:22:24.595
TECHNOLOGY TO DO THEIR THING.

04:22:24.662 --> 04:22:27.398
TO ENABLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT

04:22:27.465 --> 04:22:30.000
CAR THAT CCS. TECHNOLOGY TO

04:22:30.067 --> 04:22:31.702
ADVANCE AND ACTUALLY MAKE ANY

04:22:31.769 --> 04:22:33.304
DIFFERENCE AT ALL AND IF WE'RE

04:22:33.370 --> 04:22:34.205
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

04:22:34.271 --> 04:22:37.608
INCENTIVIZE THOSE BY HAVING.

04:22:37.675 --> 04:22:39.009
YOU KNOW HAVING A MARKET OUT

04:22:39.076 --> 04:22:41.178
THERE WHERE IT'S NEEDED. OR

04:22:41.245 --> 04:22:43.481
WHERE IT'S EFFECTIVE DAN IT'S

04:22:43.547 --> 04:22:45.749
NOT GOING TO EXIST. SO YOU KNOW

04:22:45.816 --> 04:22:47.084
YOU KNOW I JUST DIFFER A LITTLE

04:22:47.151 --> 04:22:50.054
BIT ON IT THE GRAVITY OKAY- BUT

04:22:50.121 --> 04:22:52.289
BUT ON THIS I A DIFFERENT

04:22:52.356 --> 04:22:54.658
ITEMS. I DEFEND MY DIFFERENCE

04:22:54.725 --> 04:22:56.360
OF OPINION IS BASED ON.

04:22:56.427 --> 04:22:57.361
IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY THE

04:22:57.428 --> 04:22:59.530
INCENTIVE YOU TAKE AWAY TO THE

04:22:59.597 --> 04:23:03.667
JOB OKAY OKAY SO I'M THAT.

04:23:03.734 --> 04:23:04.969
THANK YOU OF IT I MAY BE

04:23:05.035 --> 04:23:07.138
MISTAKE. AGAIN I YOU KNOW WE'RE

04:23:07.204 --> 04:23:09.740
NOT AND- AND THIS AGREEMENT AND

04:23:09.807 --> 04:23:11.809
THAT. YOU KNOW PART OF THAT

04:23:11.876 --> 04:23:13.978
FALSE NARRATIVE IS THAT THIS IS

04:23:14.044 --> 04:23:16.580
GOING TO- YOU KNOW WAS SOMEHOW

04:23:16.647 --> 04:23:18.349
IF WE ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY

04:23:18.415 --> 04:23:20.584
BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

04:23:20.651 --> 04:23:21.986
THEN MISSION ACCOMPLISHED THAT

04:23:22.052 --> 04:23:23.721
IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR

04:23:23.787 --> 04:23:25.890
IT CALLS FOR NET NEGATIVE

04:23:25.956 --> 04:23:28.792
EMISSIONS THEREAFTER AND SO YOU

04:23:28.859 --> 04:23:30.628
KNOW THERE THERE ISN'T AGAIN

04:23:30.694 --> 04:23:33.531
THERE IS NO LIMIT ON. HOW MUCH

04:23:33.597 --> 04:23:35.266
CARBON REMOVAL HOW MUCH CORE

04:23:35.332 --> 04:23:37.668
CARBON CAPTURE. AND STORAGE

04:23:37.735 --> 04:23:39.069
THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED IN

04:23:39.136 --> 04:23:41.405
ORDER TO SAVE OUR PLANET-

04:23:41.472 --> 04:23:43.974
BECAUSE- WHERE WHERE NOT WE'RE

04:23:44.041 --> 04:23:46.310
WE'RE WE'RE NOT LIMITING IT TO.

04:23:46.377 --> 04:23:47.778
TEN NET ZERO EMISSIONS WEEK

04:23:47.845 --> 04:23:49.847
WHERE WE ARE SEEKING OVER THE

04:23:49.914 --> 04:23:51.382
LONG TERM NET NEGATIVE

04:23:51.448 --> 04:23:53.517
EMISSIONS. MORE POWER TO THE

04:23:53.584 --> 04:23:55.386
CARBON CAPTURE STORES TO GO

04:23:55.452 --> 04:23:59.056
BEYOND NET ZERO EMISSIONS TO

04:23:59.123 --> 04:24:02.393
ACHIEVE NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS.

04:24:02.459 --> 04:24:05.396
MISTER WHAT. YEAH JUST A VERY

04:24:05.462 --> 04:24:07.331
QUICK QUESTION AND YOU KEEP

04:24:07.398 --> 04:24:08.766
TALKING ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE

04:24:08.832 --> 04:24:11.035
AND SO I SPENT BE SURE THE

04:24:11.101 --> 04:24:13.571
CARBON OFFSET PROJECTS LIKE FOR

04:24:13.637 --> 04:24:15.706
EXAMPLE MY DISTRICT THE YUROK

04:24:15.773 --> 04:24:16.373
HAVE BEEN PURCHASING BACK

ANCESTRAL LAND THOSE ARE NOT

04:24:18.576 --> 04:24:20.010

CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THIS

04:24:21.812 --> 04:24:23.581
THIS BILL DOES NOT BE THE

04:24:23.647 --> 04:24:25.950
