MAKE THESE OVERALL INVESTMENTS.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.820
IT IS IN AN AREA. THAT I KNOW IF

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:31.122
I WORK FOR TO SPEAK JUST OF THE

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:34.726
BAY AREA AND I DON'T DO THAT HOW

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:37.495
TO THE LACK OF- SENSITIVITY TO

JUMPS OUT AT ME AS AN AREA THAT.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.527

NUMBER YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.228
CREATING SORT OF SUCH A SMALL

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:18.730
CONTRIBUTION TO EACH PROJECT

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:20.365
THAT IT'S NOT REALLY HELPING

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:22.500

ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SO I

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:40.151

FURTHER AUGMENT THAT BUCKET-

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:50.161
THIS IS A TARC P. BUCKET BUT-

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:53.131
IT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:57.135
SHOULD BE- LOOKING AT THE

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:59.804
COLLEAGUES MANAGER IN IN ONE OF

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.139
THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I MEAN

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:05.343
CLEARLY. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.378
AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS A GENERAL

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.848
FUND AUGMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:12.183
THERE FOR. THE PROGRAM EVEN

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.185
THOUGH THE THESE ADDITIONAL

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.621
DOLLARS WOULD BE COMING FROM THE

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:19.023
GENERAL FUND THEY WOULD STILL BE

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.526
. THEY WOULD STILL BE UNDER THE

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.261
- THE FORMULA IF YOU'LL

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.929
DISTRIBUTED BY THE SAME FORMULA

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.231
REQUIREMENTS RESTRICTIONS AND SO

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:30.468
FORTH- THAT THAT WE SEE IN THE

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.904
PROGRAM CURRENTLY. IN IN IT

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.939
RAISES A QUESTION FOR ME IN

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:38.309
TERMS OF MIGHT IT NOT BE BETTER

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:41.846
. UGH TO THAT MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.848
DISCUSSING. WHETHER OR NOT WE

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.317
REALLY WANT TO DO THAT SINCE WE

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:47.552
HAVE WILL TYPICALLY HAVE

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.786
LATITUDE WITH ENERAL FUND

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:51.556
DOLLARS AND HYPOTHETICALLY WE

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.558
COULD BE TAKING A LIST OF

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.927
PROJECTS. GOING BACK TO THE

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:57.195
ALEJO'S COMMENTS ABOUT

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.330
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IN PROBABLY OR

00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:01.666
JUST GENERAL POLITICAL CONCERNS

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.868
. IN THEORY WE COULD TAKE A LIST

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:04.502
OF PROJECTS AND JUST SAY THESE

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:07.238
ARE AUGMENTED BY THESE DOLLARS

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.307
AS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE.

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.342
PRIORITY JUST LEGISLATIVE

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:16.047
ACTION- IN IT OR YOU KNOW WE

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:19.617
COULD WE COULD HAVE MONEY. JUST

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:21.853
GO DIRECTLY INTO THE PROGRAM BUT

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.754
BASED ON THE WAY THIS THIS

BUDGET RECOMMENDATION IS LAID

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:28.426

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.963
RESTRICTIONS ONE OF THE CONCERNS

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.665
I WOULD HAVE ABOUT THAT IS I

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.567
THINK THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS AS

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.569
I UNDERSTAND IT THAT WOULD NOT

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.304
BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR THE

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.606
ADDITIONAL MONEY. UNDER TI RCP

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.775
IF THEY RECEIVE DOLLARS FROM

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.843
THAT PROGRAM IN THE PAST IT'S A

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.712
ONE AND DONE TYPE OF A PROGRAM

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.647

IN SEEK MONEY FROM THE PROGRAM

00:30:56.421 --> 00:30:58.856
AGAIN. SO LET ME ASK IN THE FORM

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:00.425
OF A QUESTION AFTER MAKING ALL

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.994
THOSE COMMENTS. AM I CORRECT

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:06.197
THAT THESE DOLLARS. WOULD NOT BE

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:10.768
AVAILABLE. TO- BUT TO REAL PART

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.337
IN INTERCITY RAIL PROJECTS THAT

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.305

ABOUT THIS IN PUBLIC COMMENT-

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:59.523
IT'S ONE THING TO REDUCE BY AS

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.124
THE L. A. O. POINTS OUT THE FUEL

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.592
COSTS BY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT BUT

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:04.761
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTED THAT

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.530
WE'RE GONNA TRUE THIS SHOP- IN

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.632

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.174
WHICH WAS IN A VERY

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.678
PAINSTAKINGLY. PASS DELIVER THE

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:22.779

WON'T ADDRESS YOU KNOW THE THIRD

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:25.215
THE TOLD OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

BOTH THE PART IN A FINANCE. THE

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.593
RATIONALE IS THAT- YOU KNOW IN

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.161
IT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.797
LOOKING TO HAVE- IT TO TRY TO

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:43.433
IMPACT THE PRICE OF GAS IN- IT

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.536
AS BEST AS THEY CAN. AND THIS

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:47.871
WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS IT IN

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:52.042
THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR- YOU ARE

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.044
RIGHT THAT WOULD- WE ARE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.212
PROPOSING THAT IT COULD BE TRUE

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:58.114
IT UP. IN THE TWENTY THREE

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:58.782
TWENTY FOUR YEAR SO THIS IS ONLY

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:04.754
A ONE YEAR- ONE YOUR IMPACT. BUT

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.858
BUT YEAH THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.559
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE ANY

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.660
DIRECT IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:11.761
GASOLINE. AND AGAIN I'M SURE

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:12.696
WE'LL HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:13.830
PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW I WOULD

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.499
POINT OUT THAT IT'S SORT OF.

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.534
INTERNAL CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.702
THAT THEY MOST CONSUMERS

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.303
PROBABLY WON'T SEE THE BENEFITS

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.072
THEY WOULD CERTAINLY FEEL THE

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:25.275
PAIN- IN IN TWO YEARS- AND SO I

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:26.743
WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS WORTHY OF.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.079
SOME SECOND THOUGHT. THANK YOU

ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:47.797
DIRECTLY IMPACT RETAIL GASOLINE

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.233
PRICES TO THE CONSUMER. I'M

YES STATUTES TO TRY TO ENSURE A

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:16.226
GUARANTEE IN THAT REGARD AS FAR

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:17.961
AS THAT YOU CONSUMER IMPACT

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:21.131
WOULD BE PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL-

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:23.233
BUT OUR ANALYSIS DID CONCLUDE

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.002
THAT- THIS SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.805
OF. OF THE- TAX REDUCTION LIKELY

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.740
WOULD BE PASSED THROUGH TO

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:34.210
RETAIL PRICES ARE BASED ON- SORT

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:36.079
OF OUR REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:39.049
REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF PAST-

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.917
SHE'LL TEXT CHANGES IT WAS NOT

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:45.088
PASSED THROUGH. RECEIVES THE

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:48.458
BENEFIT OF. WELL THEN THEM BE-

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:49.726
BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKERS

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:52.395
INVOLVED IN THE- FUEL SUPPLY

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:55.398
CHAIN. REYES WHO THE FOSSIL FUEL

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.534
INDUSTRY YOU WILL. IS SENSUALLY

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.235
RECOUP THE BENEFIT OF ANYTHING

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.371
THAT DOESN'T END UP AT THE

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:03.206
RETAIL PUMP IS ANOTHER WOULD HE

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:09.579
SAID. YES OKAY. IN HIS. GIVEN

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:12.148
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE NO PRACTICAL

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:14.517
WAY TO CONTROL RETAIL PUMP

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:17.821
PRICES EVEN FROM. DISPENSER TO

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:20.624
DISPENSER STATION TO STATION-

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.525
ISN'T THERE SOME CURL CLEAR

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:25.895
THAT. IF YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:27.464
WHERE THE MAJORITY OF IT GOES.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.099
THAT THE BACKLASH ON THIS

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:31.601
PROPOSAL IS THAT WE JUST CUT A

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.804
DEAL WITH A POSSIBLE INDUSTRY TO

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.107
. BENEFIT THEM BUT IT ISN'T

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.442
THERE SOME POTENTIAL BACKLASH

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:40.443
HERE THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:45.248
SAYS MY GAS PRICES WENT UP. OVER

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:51.655
THE PAST YEAR NOT DOWN. THANKS

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.556
FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR ASKED

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:57.494
CERTAINLY- THERE'S UNCERTAINTY

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.829
IN THE IN THE OUTCOME MOST MOST

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:02.198
STAFF POLICY ACTIONS AND SENATE

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.067
IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT SAD

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.702
BUSINESSES AND MANY IN THE

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.504
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY WOULD

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.606
BENEFIT TO SOME CERTAIN EXTENT

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.875
FURNACE- BUT WE DO THINK THAT

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:12.809
THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:14.911
SUGGESTS THAT CONSUMERS WOULD

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.814
DERIVE. MOST OF THE BENEFITS I

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.116
RESPECT THEM YOUR PROJECTION ON

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.317
THAT I DON'T MEAN TO CELICA

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:24.254
DON'T AND I TOOK- JUST ENOUGH

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.524
ECONOMICS AS AN UNDERGRAD IN

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.958
SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN BUSINESS

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.326
INCLUDING. A ONE POINT IN MY

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:35.465
LIFE POSTING GASOLINE PRICES. AT

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.267
A SERVICE STATION SO I KNOW. A

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.968
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CONTROL

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:39.569
IT BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:40.537
ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE YOU'RE

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:43.006
PUTTING OUT THERE IS THAT IF YOU

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.808
LOWER THE WHOLESALE COST

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.209
ESSENTIALLY THROUGH THIS MEASURE

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.044
IT SHOULD SHOW UP ON THE RETAIL

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:50.413
SIDE ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL I

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.382
JUST DON'T HAVE A STRONG SENSE

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.850
OF ASSURANCE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:55.518
HAPPEN IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.620
INDUSTRY SO. THANK YOU FOR

00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:01.257
ANSWERING THE QUESTION. YEAH I

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.093
FIGURED WE COULD CALL ON MISTER

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:05.762
WELLS TO. ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE-

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.497
MISTER WELLS YOU DO SAY THAT THE

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.332
PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO HAVE AN-

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:12.736
IMPACT ON GAS PRICES AND HAVE AN

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:15.004
IMPACT ON PRICES AT THE PUMP. IF

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:18.608
WE DON'T HAVE. A WAY TO CONTROL

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:21.144
WHERE THAT REDUCTION IN TAXES

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.582
WOULD GO. UP AND IT'S JUST OUR-

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:28.451
TOM PREDICTION RIGHT THE-

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:31.121
ESTIMATE IT WOULD GO TO THE TO

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:37.427
THE- THE CONSUMER- WHY WOULD WE-

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:40.930
TAKE THAT- TAKE THAT RISK HOW IS

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.532
IT THAT WE COULD SAY IT'S

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.300
ACTUALLY GOING TO IMPACT THE

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:46.302
PRICE AT THE PUMP ONE QUESTION

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:50.039
SECOND IS. IF IT IMPACTS IMPACTS

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.741
THE PRICE AT THE PUMP PUTS IT

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.409
WHAT AMOUNT WILL THE AVERAGE

00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:57.080
CONSUMER SAVE PER YEAR. SO THAT

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.815
WE COULD THEN A MATCH THAT-

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:02.552
COMPARE THAT TO THE LOSS OF FIVE

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.453
HUNDRED OVER FIVE HUNDRED

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.657
MILLION DOLLARS. AND AGAIN ALL I

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:09.025
CAN SAY WELL FIRST LOG SAID

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.628
THERE'S- ON ON AVERAGE WE DO

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.830
ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION GALLONS OF

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:18.168
GASOLINE- CONSUME PER YEAR SO-

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:20.870
EVERY EACH ANY CHANGE IN THE

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:22.806
PRICE OF GAS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:25.408
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- IN

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:27.677
GASOLINE TAX REVENUE. SO THE

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:30.780
IMPACT OF NOT INCREASING- THE

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:34.851
PRICE. BY THREE CENTS A GALLON

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:36.252
SPOCK'S NOT WE WHAT ARE THAT

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.021
AMOUNT WOULD BE WOULD BE ABOUT

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:39.222
YOU KNOW FORTY FIFTY MILLION

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.657
DOLLARS IN GASOLINE AND THEN A

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:42.992
SIMILAR TYPE OF WORK- SIMILAR

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:47.163
TYPE. OF CONSUMPTION ALGORITHM

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.999
FOR DIESEL. WHICH IS ABOUT THREE

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.234
BILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL PER

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.469
YEAR. SO ALL IN ALL THAT'S WHERE

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:55.171
WE GET TO THE FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.739
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WITH FIVE

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:57.473
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.678
APPROXIMATELY. IN REVENUE THAT

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:05.648
GOES ON CASH. I'M SURE. YOU KNOW

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.550
WE ARE RELYING ON THE ECONOMIC

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.552
PRINCIPLE THAT THE PRICE IS

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.621
BASED ON- THE COLLECTION OF

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:14.123
IMPORTS AND THAT THIS REDUCTION

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.860
IN THAT INPUT WITHIN RESULTS IN

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:23.233
THE PRODUCT IT SOLD FOR- LIKE-

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:24.300
OUR CALL WE GET THE L. A. O.

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:27.570
SAID IT WOULD BE- DIFFICULT AND

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:31.908

STEP IN HERE AS DIRECTOR

03:00:53.576 --> 03:00:56.212
CALIFORNIA FOR MOTOR VEHICLES-

SENATE I SHARE YOUR CONCERN- I

03:00:58.647 --> 03:00:59.982
THINK MORE ONE PART OF THIS

03:01:00.049 --> 03:01:01.850
ECOSYSTEM BUT A VERY IMPORTANT

03:01:01.917 --> 03:01:02.985
PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM TO MAKE

03:01:03.052 --> 03:01:04.853
SURE THAT AS DRIVERS ARE TRAINED

03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:06.222
AT VARIOUS TRAINING SCHOOLS AND

03:01:06.288 --> 03:01:07.856
SO ON THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET.

03:01:07.923 --> 03:01:09.425
CERTIFIED CREDENTIAL HI

03:01:09.491 --> 03:01:10.693
COMPLETES THEIR EXAMINATION SO

03:01:10.759 --> 03:01:12.194
THEY GET ON THE ROAD I DON'T

03:01:12.261 --> 03:01:15.297
THINK WERE THE ONLY PART OF THIS

03:01:15.364 --> 03:01:16.565
ECOSYSTEM THAT IS THE BIG

03:01:16.632 --> 03:01:18.367
CHALLENGE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

03:01:18.434 --> 03:01:19.602
MAKE SURE WE CAN STEP UP AND

03:01:19.668 --> 03:01:20.636
MAKE SURE DRIVERS ARE SORT OF

03:01:20.703 --> 03:01:22.705
WHY WE DO HAVE AN AGING

03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:23.339
POPULATION AND CALIFORNIANS CDL

03:01:23.405 --> 03:01:24.473
HOLDERS CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL

03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:26.108
DRIVER HOLDERS. ARE OLDER THAN

03:01:26.175 --> 03:01:27.776
THE POPULATION IN GENERAL AND

03:01:27.843 --> 03:01:29.612
MATTER OF FACT YOU KNOW 60% OF

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:31.614
OUR CURRENCY HOLDERS ARE ABOVE

03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:34.250
AGE FORTY FIVE. YOU KNOW 35% OR

03:01:34.316 --> 03:01:36.652
ABOVE AGE FIFTY FIVE SO WE HAVE

03:01:36.719 --> 03:01:37.786
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:01:37.853 --> 03:01:38.454
LEAVING THE FIELD SO PART OF IT

03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:39.855
IS JUST THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE

03:01:39.922 --> 03:01:41.924
PART OF THE PROBLEM AND YOU KNOW

03:01:41.991 --> 03:01:44.093
YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THE STUDIES ON

03:01:44.159 --> 03:01:45.961
SPECIALLY LONG HAUL DRIVERS.

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:48.297
IT'S NOT A GREAT JOB AND PEOPLE

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:49.498
THAT PEOPLE ARE TURNING OVER BUT

03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:51.700
OF COURSE THAT DRIVES THE NEED

03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:52.768
FOR NEW DRIVERS SHOULD BE PUT

03:01:52.835 --> 03:01:54.436
INTO THE FIELD SO IT'S A IT'S A

03:01:54.503 --> 03:01:55.804
VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND WE'RE

03:01:55.871 --> 03:01:57.106
TRYING TO DO OUR END OF-

03:01:57.172 --> 03:01:58.707
TRANSPORT OUR END OF THE

03:01:58.774 --> 03:01:59.608
SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:00.276
DRIVERS WHO WANT TO BE

03:02:00.342 --> 03:02:06.882
COMMERCIAL DRIVERS. CAN GET SORT

03:02:06.949 --> 03:02:09.184
OF. YEAH I AND I AM. THAT I'M DO

03:02:09.251 --> 03:02:11.086
- I'M JUST. ASKING WHAT. AND HOW

03:02:11.153 --> 03:02:12.421
DID WE REACH THE CA. THAT PASSED

03:02:12.488 --> 03:02:14.156
WHERE THE- IS. BECAUSE THIS IS

03:02:14.223 --> 03:02:17.826
QUITE A HUGE. INVESTMENT AND IF

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:20.129
HE SAID. OKAY BASED ON THIS

03:02:20.195 --> 03:02:22.197
SYSTEM THAT. THIS IS THE

03:02:22.264 --> 03:02:24.967
CONCLUSION THAT OUR PEACE. IS

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:27.136
ESSENTIAL TO GETTING MORE TRUCK

03:02:27.202 --> 03:02:30.572
DRIVERS I JUST. I HAVEN'T HEARD

03:02:30.639 --> 03:02:35.044
WHY AND WHO CAME UP WITH THIS AS

03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:37.079
WAS THE RATIONALE FOR IT OTHER

03:02:37.146 --> 03:02:40.749
THAN WE SEE A LOT ON ON YOU KNOW

03:02:40.816 --> 03:02:42.418
TV WE SEE A LOT ON THE NEWS THAT

03:02:42.484 --> 03:02:44.586
THERE'S A SUPPLY CHAIN OF

03:02:44.653 --> 03:02:47.723
PROBLEM BUT- I HAVEN'T SEEN

03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:49.558
SPECIFICALLY THAT HAS ANYTHING

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:52.728
TO DO WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO GET

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.497
A- DRIVER'S LICENSE. I JUST

03:02:55.564 --> 03:02:57.433
THINK IT CLARIFIED YEAH YEAH I

03:02:57.499 --> 03:02:58.801
TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

03:02:58.867 --> 03:03:00.803
ARE IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM AND

03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:03.439
WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ROLE IN IN

03:03:03.505 --> 03:03:05.441
RESOLVING OUR PORTION WEEKEND WE

03:03:05.507 --> 03:03:07.109
HAVE THESE DRIVERS ARE EXTREME

03:03:07.176 --> 03:03:08.911
SCHOOLS SAY. THEY'VE BEEN PAYING

03:03:08.977 --> 03:03:10.179
A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE

03:03:10.245 --> 03:03:11.447
THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO BE

03:03:11.513 --> 03:03:12.848
ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET YOU ON THE

03:03:12.915 --> 03:03:15.517
ROAD AND PLAY- YOU KNOW.

03:03:15.584 --> 03:03:16.485
PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY MORE

03:03:16.552 --> 03:03:18.787
FULLY SO I THINK WE HAVE AN

03:03:18.854 --> 03:03:19.421
OBLIGATION TO THEM TO MAKE SURE

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:21.056
THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW TAKE

03:03:21.123 --> 03:03:23.759
THEIR EXAMS AS AS THE- THESE

03:03:23.826 --> 03:03:24.893
KIND OF GENERALLY TAKE EXAM

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:26.495
SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THEIR

03:03:26.562 --> 03:03:28.030
RESIDENTS AND BRING OUT OF LOS

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:30.999
ANGELES- IT WAS OVER. 20% OF OUR

03:03:31.066 --> 03:03:33.035
EXAMS ARE IN THAT GREATER AREA

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:34.169
AND IF YOU GO TO THE FURTHER

03:03:34.236 --> 03:03:35.504
EAST YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER

03:03:35.571 --> 03:03:37.439
YOU KNOW 1520% AND DIDN'T KNOW

03:03:37.506 --> 03:03:39.441
WHERE THAT PROPOSALS ARE TO BE

03:03:39.508 --> 03:03:40.442
NORTHERN L. A. AND ALSO IN THE

03:03:40.509 --> 03:03:42.878
BAY AREA. IT'S ANOTHER 10% IN

03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:43.912
THE BAY AREA THAT ARE

03:03:43.979 --> 03:03:45.714
CONCENTRATED THERE SO WE HAVE A

03:03:45.781 --> 03:03:47.049
FAIR AMOUNT OF THE BAND AND SO I

03:03:47.116 --> 03:03:49.418
CAN'T TELL YOU IS THAT DEMAND.

03:03:49.485 --> 03:03:51.954

WITH YOU THE DEMOGRAPHICS B. THE

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:56.258
QUALITY OF LIFE ESPECIALLY LONG

03:03:56.325 --> 03:03:57.526
HAUL DRIVERS BECAUSE YOU TURN

03:03:57.593 --> 03:03:59.294
OVER. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:00.796
WE DO OUR PART I THINK DOING

03:04:00.863 --> 03:04:03.132
NOTHING AND I MEAN PRETTY MUCH

03:04:03.198 --> 03:04:03.732
FROZEN DO NOTHING HERE BUT I

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:05.367
THINK. YOU KNOW NOT NOT

03:04:05.434 --> 03:04:06.602
COMPLETING THIS TASK FOR THE

03:04:06.668 --> 03:04:08.036
STATE AND INCOMPLETE IT

03:04:08.103 --> 03:04:08.871
CURRENTLY IN PROCESS I THINK

03:04:08.937 --> 03:04:10.906
ALSO REPRESENTING YOU PROBABLY

03:04:10.973 --> 03:04:11.740
HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:04:11.807 --> 03:04:13.308
TRAINED LOOKING FOR JOBS I CAN'T

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:14.510
GET CERTIFIED IN THE STATE AND

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:16.545
WORK. TO HELP CLEAR THE PORTS

03:04:16.612 --> 03:04:17.746
AND OTHER THINGS SO. IT'S

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:20.349
COMPLEX AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:21.650
WHAT EXACTLY THE PROBLEM IS WE

03:04:21.717 --> 03:04:23.485
ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN

03:04:23.552 --> 03:04:32.995
KEEP THE EXISTING. PROCESS

03:04:33.061 --> 03:04:34.163
WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE

03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:35.831
CAN. M. I'M SURE I BEEN CUT. OF

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:37.566
THAT TO THAT YOUR CURRENT DO

03:04:37.633 --> 03:04:38.734
HAVE A HOUSE OF. TWENTY THREE

03:04:38.801 --> 03:04:41.236
TO. SITES IN THE CASE- IT ONLY

03:04:41.303 --> 03:04:42.471
FOR. REALLY TO KIND OF HANG.

03:04:42.538 --> 03:04:43.405
WHAT THE TEST WOULD. KIND OF

03:04:43.472 --> 03:04:45.107
ANCHOR. BOB WHITTEN BETWEEN THE

03:04:45.174 --> 03:04:46.508
BIG. BACK THE BASICS. IN THE ROW

03:04:46.575 --> 03:04:48.977
TEST. THAT'S A LOT OUR KIND OF

03:04:49.044 --> 03:04:50.813
IT THE FEEL OFFICE IS WELL AND

03:04:50.879 --> 03:04:52.147
SO WE HAVE. A LOT OF. SPACE TO

03:04:52.214 --> 03:04:54.550
FISHING- THE KIND OF. ON TOP

03:04:54.616 --> 03:04:56.752
STREETS IN COLD SAC- THEY WERE

03:04:56.819 --> 03:04:59.254
BE. SUB FIELD OFFICES WERE OF AB

03:04:59.321 --> 03:05:01.123
. AS AN EXAMPLE. IN ON OUR LOCAL

03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:04.259
AREA. I'M REAL. ST AS- WHERE THE

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:05.627
POP. IS PROBABLY WHAT IS. TWENTY

03:05:05.694 --> 03:05:06.929
THIRTY YEARS. BUT I'LL POPULAR.

03:05:06.995 --> 03:05:08.564
ARE IN. THE MORE OF AN ISSUE

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:11.533
SAFETY. WEBER CONDUCTING THIS.

03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:12.501
SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

03:05:12.568 --> 03:05:13.769
ALL ARE COMPOUND. IS GOING TO BE

03:05:13.836 --> 03:05:15.804
A BILL. IN THE EVENT THAT MORE

03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:16.872
TRUCK DRIVER ARE DIDN'T FOR THE

03:05:16.939 --> 03:05:18.707

ENVIRONMENT. SURNAME IS. YOU

03:05:33.555 --> 03:05:34.523
SHOULD NOT SURE JUST JUST I'VE

03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:36.492
GOT A- A FRAMEWORK FOR ABOUT THE

03:05:36.558 --> 03:05:38.093
IF THE CURRENT WAY TIME- BUT

EXPECT FROM THE INFO AND BY. SO

03:05:47.369 --> 03:05:48.737

SEEMS. IMPROVEMENTS MADE. MANY

03:06:04.820 --> 03:06:06.722
STEPS. NOW THIS IS A OF THE

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:09.224
STATE JUST WEEK FRESNO PARTY.

03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.460

AREA WHERE. THE WAY WE WILL BE

03:06:33.081 --> 03:06:35.150
TESTING SUCH AS A- THAT ACTIVITY

03:06:35.217 --> 03:06:36.084
THAT ARE UNDER WAY THAT I'VE

AND INSPECTED AND SO ON ON A

03:06:52.234 --> 03:06:54.036
LARGE PAD SO THEY ARE SAFE AND

WE CAN DO MANY OF THEM

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:56.838
