FIRST WE WILL HEAR FROM- CDC ARE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY MILLER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH AN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. CDCR IS REQUESTING FUNDING AND POSITIONS TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEPARTMENT STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS SCREENING REFERRAL INVESTIGATIVE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES. THESE RESOURCES WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT A STATEWIDE CENTRALIZED SCREENING PROCESS FOR ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION STAFF TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS THAT WILL BE ROUTED TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR INVESTIGATION. THE LEGAL WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED NUMBERS OF INVESTIGATIONS AND RESULTING DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THE SUPPORT STAFF NEEDED AT INSTITUTIONS WITH THE GREATEST WORKLOADS TO COORDINATE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO STAFF MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING THE SCHEDULING OF INTERVIEWS AND COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE. THE TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND SUPPORT NEEDED TO TRACK AND MONITOR ALLEGATIONS STATEWIDE AND IT MINISTRY TO STAFF NECESSARY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASED NUMBERS OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND LEGAL AFFAIRS STAFF. ALONG WITH ME TODAY ARE KRISTEN'S WYLER FROM THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AND KIMBERLY CYCLE FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WE'RE HAPPY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL AND WE CAN ALSO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF. THE CHANGES IN THIS PROPOSAL IF YOU SO WISH THANK YOU FOR- IF IT COULD BE DONE VERY BRIEFLY I THINK AN OVERVIEW WHO SHOULD BE A GOOD THING TO START FROM THANK YOU. COURSE MADAM CHAIR CELLS THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN THIS REQUEST WILL ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE THE PROCESS FOR REVIEWING ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT INVOLVING AN INCARCERATED PERSON OR FRAWLEY. AB A FULLY AGREE EVENTS WAS REVIEWED AT THE INSTITUTION HER ROLE OFFICE OR OTHER LOCATION WHERE THE COMPLAINT ORIGINATED. IF IT WAS DETERMINED TO INVOLVE A COMPLAINT AGAINST STAFF. IT WAS SENT TO THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY GENERALLY THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON WITHIN THAT STAFF MEMBERS PROGRAMMER DIVISION. NOW IN OUR NEW PROCESS THE REVIEW OF ALLEGATIONS MADE BY INCARCERATED PEOPLE OF CRAWLEY'S FROM THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE PRO OFFICES WILL BE TRANSFERRED FROM WHERE THEY ORIGINATED. TO A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM WITHIN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CDC OUR HEADQUARTERS. THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM REPLACES THE SCREENING OF GRIEVANCES BY INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES AND CENTRALIZES THAT SCREENING IN ONE OFFICE FOR ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY. AS WELL AS REMOVED ANY ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED LOCAL BIAS BY ELIMINATING THE ABILITY INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES TO REMOVE GREATEST SAYS FROM THE REVIEW PROCESS. ALL INSTITUTIONS AND PAROLE OFFICERS WILL ROUTE GRIEVANCES AND COMPLAINTS TO THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIVING THE GRIEVANCE OR COMPLAINT. AND THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM WILL BE TASKED WITH REVIEWING COMPLAINTS AND DETERMINING FIRST WHETHER CONTAINS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND THEN SECOND IF IT DOES CONTAIN AN ALLEGATION OF MISCONDUCT WHETHER IT WILL BE ROUTED TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL INQUIRY. WHETHER IT WILL BE ROUTED TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR A CRIMINAL. OR ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION. WE'VE ALSO A ALLERGY TO INDEX WHICH WILL BE USED BY CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAMS TO DETERMINE WHEN A COMPLAINT WILL BE ROUTED TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR INVESTIGATION. WELL EACH COMPLAINT WILL BE INVESTIGATED A COMPLAINT WILL BE REFERRED TO BY A FRIEND DESTINATION WHAT INVOLVES ALLEGATIONS OF USE OF FORCE STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. DISHONESTY DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT RETALIATION AND CODE OF SILENCE. IF THE ALLEGATION DOES NOT INVOLVE THOSE SPECIFIED ALLEGATIONS ON THE ALLEGATION DECISION INDEX IT WILL BE REFERRED TO THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY FOR AN ALLEGATION INQUIRY. HOWEVER EVEN THOSE ALLEGATIONS GOING TO THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY WILL ONCE THEY'RE COMPLETED BE ROUTED BACK TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHERE THEY WILL BE REVIEWED BY AN OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS MANAGER. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR COMPLETE UNBIASED AND THOROUGH BEFORE BEING RETURNED TO THE INSTITUTION SO THAT THE HIRING AUTHORITY CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE ALLEGATIONS. THESE EFFORTS COUPLED WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS CHANGES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR STOCK. COMPLAINT PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MILLER- WE WILL THE- UP ALLY G. OFFICE PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM EMBRACING. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD ON OUR PROPOSALS THIS MORNING OUR PROPOSAL TODAY IS TO MONITOR THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS THAT WAS JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU. WE ARE ASKING FOR TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS TO MONITOR THIS NEW PROCESS WHICH IS BASED ON THE NEW REGULATIONS ON AMENDING THE CURRENT PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT HAS IN PLACE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOLLOWING REPORT RELEASED BY THE O. I. G. BERMAN BEGAN DEVELOPING A PROCESS TO ADDRESS INCARCERATED PERSONS COMPLAINS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. ALSO AT THAT TIME THE O. I. G. GAIN THE ADDED RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED A PROCESS RESULTING IN THE CREATION OF THEIR ALLEGATION INCREASE THE MANAGEMENT SECTION ALSO KNOWN AS BEING. A UNIT THAT WAS DEDICATED TO CONDUCTING ENQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IN RESPONSE THE L. I. G. CREATED A TEAM OF FIVE STAFF MEMBERS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE INCREASED CONDUCTED BY GAINS. SINCE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO NOW OUR TEAM OF FIVE CONTINUES TO PERFORM THIS CONTEMPORANEA OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENTS PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND INVESTIGATING INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. THE TEAM ALSO TRACKS THE ALLEGATIONS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS APPEAL PROCESS. CURRENTLY WE USE A COMBINATION OF IN PERSON AND REMOTE MONITORING TO OVERSEE THESE GAMES AND CURRY. OUR TEAM ALSO COLLECTS AND ANALYZES VARIOUS STAFF COMPLAINT RELATED DATA POINTS INCLUDING AIMS WORKLOAD STATISTICS AND STAFF COMPLAINTS WERE PERTAINS BY THE PRESENT. GOING FORWARD OUR PROPOSAL WILL MONITOR THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR NEW STAFF COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION PROCESS WE ARE ASKING FOR STAFF TO MONITOR 30% OF THE DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT CENTRALIZED SCREENING CHANGE. THE PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THE TEAM IS CONSISTENTLY MAKING DECISIONS AND THE DECISIONS MADE ARE IN REGARDS TO THE PROPER HANDLING OF THE GRIEVANCES RECEIVED FROM INCARCERATED PERCENT. WE ARE ALSOASKING FOR STAFF TO MONITOR 10% OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. DR ED BY THE DEPARTMENT'S NEWLY CREATED AN ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT ALSO KNOWN AS A ARE YOU. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE DEPARTMENT'S NEW REGULATIONS INDICATES THAT THESE CASES WILL BE THE MOST SERIOUS AND COMPLEX ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT ARE MONITORING OF THESE CASES WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS CONDUCTING THOROUGH COMPLETE AND UNBIASED INVESTIGATIONS. WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE TIMELY FEEDBACK TO THE DEPARTMENT AND TO ISSUE PUBLIC PORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSING- WOULD LIKE TO ASK FINANCE FOR YOUR COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING A BRAND COULD BE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPLORING VARIOUS OPTIONS AND MAY BRING PORTER PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE SPRING. THIS INCLUDES CONSIDERING RESOURCES ANSWER LOOKS TO OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL INCREASED THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR THE ORGY TO MONITOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT. ROUGHLY A HUNDRED FORTY OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED OUT OF EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS PROPOSED. WAS AIMED AT PROVIDE. YOU WITH RESOURCE TO OVERSEE THE MOST SERVICE COMPLEX CASES BASED ON THE ALLEGATION ASSISTANT POSITION INDEX THOSE INCORPORATED INTO CCAR'S REGULAR TEMPER I MEAN FOR SAMPLE SIZE TOTAL BECAUSE FOR RANGE OF. ALLEGATIONS THE ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT WILL BE INVESTIGATING WHILE PROVIDING THOUGH I G. WITH THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE MOST SERIOUS CASES. OF FIVE OMAN THROUGH MONITORING ALSO RECOGNIZES THE MANY IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS YEAR HAS MADE IN THE STAFF MISCONDUCT PROCESS. BUT WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AS WE WORK TO. THANK YOU MUCH I WOULD ON NOW TO HEAR FROM THE L. A. OLE MISS O'NEILL. THE MORNING MORNING. CAITLYN ARE NOW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSED. RESOURCES FOR CDCR TO IMPLEMENT A STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS REASONABLE HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSED LEVEL OF ARRANGING MONITORING OF THAT PROCESS MAY NOT. MEET LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE ITS SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT AND SIGNAGE- AG RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY. AND TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH. ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT. AND HOW THAT MAY CARRY OVER INTO- I G. REISS. WE PROVIDE THREE QUESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WHICH ARE FIRST SHOULD- I. G. MONITOR ALL TYPES OF CLAIMS RECEIVED BY THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING. UNDER THE PROPOSAL OR G. WOULD ONLY BE MONITORING. GULAR GRIEVANCES THAT ARE RECEIVED 30% OF REGULAR GRIEVANCES I RECEIVE I TO CENTRALLY SCREENING TEAM. I WOULD NOT UNDER THE PROPOSAL MONITOR HEALTH CARE GRIEVANCES REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OR THIRD PARTY FILED CLAIMS SATISFIED- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SECOND SHOULD ALREADY MONITOR A LARGER PORTION OF INVESTIGATIONS AS YOU HEARD OR G. IS PROPOSING TO MONITOR NEW PROCESS. HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT EIGHTY. EIGHT EXISTING- SEPARATE YET SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS PROCESS THROUGH WHICH CDC ARE- HANDLES ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT REFERRED BY WARDENS ANOTHER HIRING AUTHORITIES- UNDER THAT PROCESS FOR THAT PROCESS- AG MONITORS ABOUT 15% OF INVESTIGATIONS. AND THE LETTER THE LETTER MAY DECIDE THAT IT IT WANTS A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW A LARGER PERCENTAGE SIMILAR PERCENTAGE- TO THAT PROCESS- AND THEN START IT SHOULD- I. G. MONITOR THE QUALITY OF THE ROUGHLY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. LOCAL INQUIRY INCREASE THAT ARE CONDUCTED UNDER THIS PROCESS SO AS WAS MENTIONED- ALLEGATIONS AND DON'T NEED TO BE. DON'T FOLLOW THE ALLEGATIONS- INQUIRY. THE ALLEGATION INDEX- FOR REFERRAL TO LOOK FOR IN A WAY A INVESTIGATION WILL BE REFERRED BACK TO THE PRISON OR PAROLE REGION FOR A LOCAL INQUIRY- AND UNDER THE PROPOSAL- AG WOULD NOT. MONITOR THOSE INCREASED OR THE REPORTS THAT ARE PRODUCED. THROUGH THEM. SO IT'S PAST THAT SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD WANT TO PROVIDE OR JEWISH RESOURCES TO EITHER MONITOR THOSE ENQUIRIES AND SALAS OR- MONITOR THE REPORTS THAT COME OUT OF TIME. FOR INDEPENDENCE AND COMPLETENESS. AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- POLICE WILL MOVE ON TO- ON YOUR OWN QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES SENATE QUARTERS IN LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM- CDC ARE REGARDING THE L. A. THOSE COMMENTS- RIGHT I HAD SIMILAR NOTES. REGARDING. THE POTENTIAL YOU KNOW LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITH STE WHAT APPEARS TO BE SO MUCH OF THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS- SELF REGULATED. LISA TIME UNDERSTANDING IT- IN IN THE L. A- TALKED ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE STEPPING IN AND YOU KNOW GIVEN SOME MORE GUIDANCE BUT I GUESS I'M JUST WONDERING CAN. CDCR TAKE SOME OF THAT. ADVICE INTO ACCOUNT- IF THAT'S THE SENTIMENT THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM- FROM FOLKS INCLUDING US- IT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO COME IN AND SET THE SYSTEM UP SO THAT PERHAPS THE O. I. G. TAKES A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES OR- A COMES IN AND DOES SOME ADDITIONAL MONITORING JUST TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT- BUT EVERYTHING'S. FALLING OF ACCORDING TO PLAN SO THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION AND IT IS JUST HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO DO MORE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR- I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT AS AN AGENCY WE TAKE EVERY ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE ARE COMMITTED. TO ENSURING THAT ALL ALLEGATIONS ARE DRESSED PROPERLY FAIRLY AND THOROUGHLY. WE DO HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S ROLE IN OUR PROCESS- AND WE WELCOME THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND REVIEWS. WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO COORDINATE WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS THEY GO AND MONITOR OUR PROCESS WHICH THEY CURRENTLY DO A AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT OUR FUNCTIONS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT- AS SUCH YOU KNOW WE DO THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE IS THE ONE THAT MONITORS THOSE. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR US AS AN AGENCY TO WEIGH IN ON WEIGH IN ON THE LEVEL OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OVERSIGHT- INSTEAD AGAIN WE ALWAYS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM WITH WHATEVER DECISIONS ARE MADE. IF YOU'RE JUST I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW UP COMMENT EIGHT I GUESS WHAT I WAS REALLY ASKING IS HOW MUCH MORE ARE YOU WILLING TO COLLABORATE WITH THEM YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. COMING UP WITH- GREATER OVERSIGHT I JUST. IF I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S- LEANING INTO THE ELOISE RECOMMENDATION THAT'S THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S A COMMITTEE WITH MULTIPLE FOLKS HERE IN A LARGE LEGISLATURE BUT- M. PROJECT IN A LITTLE BIT I THINK FROM. MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE WHERE. WE RAN INTO A LOT OF PAUL PROBLEMS WITH BOTH GRIEVANCE ISSUES IN THE JAILS AND ALSO WHISTLEBLOWER ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THE JAILS IN THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE- WHEN WE- ROUTED. THOSE COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW BACK TO THE SAME. ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS WERE DIRECTED AT IT SO. I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS- YOU KNOW SOME- ALIGNMENT ON MY PART WITH WITH THE A LITTLE L. L. A. O.'S POSITION I AM NOT SETTLED ON WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD BE DONE YET BUT- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT. TO GET THAT OUT- AND SECRETARY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU- ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE BEEN ONGOING ISSUES AT CDC ARE- AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL- WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT ARE ASKING ENTITIES TO OVERSEE THEMSELVES DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK- ESPECIALLY IN PARTICULAR WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CORRECTIONS EVEN WHEN ALL PARTIES ARE. VERY WELL INTENTIONED- BUT THIS DOESN'T WORK SO WE CAN SEE THAT CDCR IS MOVING IN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- THIS IS A NEW PROCESS HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER IT- RIGHT I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC. QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT- FIRST WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL- IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS YOU HAVE WITH THIS NEW PROCESS- AND IS YOUR OVERSIGHT- TAILORED TOWARDS THE AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COVERED- AND DO YOU. SEE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR YOUR OFFICE TO MONITOR THIS NEW PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- IN REGARDS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S NEWS NEW PROCESS I'M THE ONLY DOES COMMEND THEM FOR COMING UP WITH A NEW PROCESS. IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL OF OUR REPORTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH HAS BEEN A ESSENTIALLY INDICATED THAT THAT THE PROCESS THAT WAS IN PLACE REGARDING STAFF COMPLAINTS ANY GRIEVANCES I'M WAS NOT WORKING I'M AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HOUSE. EXCUSE ME I'M OFFICE DOES BUILD A LOT OF LAYERS OF LAYERS OF REVIEW- IT DOES NEED SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH INCLUDED REMOVING THE INITIAL SCREENING PROCESS FROM THE PRISONS AND TAKING THOSE OUT OF THE PRESENT AND SENDING THEM TO A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM- THE- I. D. DOESN'T PLAN ON MONITORING THAT PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE- PROPERLY AND CONSISTENTLY I'M AS THERE IS AN ALLEGATION- DECISION INDEX THAT COULD BE SUBJECT TO SOME DISCRETION BY THE INDIVIDUAL ANALYST REVIEWING THESE- COMPLAINTS. THAT ARE BEING RECEIVED SO WE DO IT WE DO COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR COMING UP WITH THE NEW PROCESS BUT AS WITH ANY NEW PROCESS- THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. AND THERE WILL BE UPS AND DOWNS AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WITH OUR MONITORING WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TIMELY FEEDBACK TO THE DEPARTMENT SO THEY CAN AVOID SOME OF THE PITFALLS THAT- WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE PROCESS THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE- OVER THE LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF THAT TEAM'S INQUIRY PROCESS- WE DID FIND SEVERAL FAULT AND NOT THAT WE REPORTED LAST YEAR. AND INCLUDING A NUMBER OF- INCARCERATED PERSONS GRIEVANCES REMAINING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS ONES NOT BEING INVESTIGATED- BY AN OUTSIDE OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION ENTITY- IN REGARDS TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- OUR PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE. WE ARE REQUESTING WHAT ARE AGENCY WHICH IS MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS- HUNDRED LESS THAN A HUNDRED FORTY- PEOPLE WE WOULD LIKE TO GET WHAT'S OPERATIONAL FEASIBLE FOR US AND WE BELIEVE WHAT OUR REQUEST IS ASKING FOR WILL ALLOW US TO START THAT MONITORING PROCESS RIGHT AWAY. AND THEN WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW- AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS NECESSARY BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'VE ASKED FOR IT DOES GIVE US. A WINDOW INTO THE PROCESS- OVERSIGHT NECESSARILY LOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE WHAT WE DO LOOK FOR IS A WEAKNESS IN THE PROCESS AND WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS IN REGARDS TO THOSE WEAKNESSES SO THE DEPARTMENT CAN FIX THEIR- LAW ALL THE PROCESS. WE BELIEVE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR SUFFICIENT TICKET TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT AND TO START THE MONITORING PROCESS AS SOON AS THE- AS SOON AS WE CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF STAFFING TO DO THAT. I JUST HAVE ONE SORT OF FOLLOW UP- THE L. L. IS OFFICE- MADE SOME SPECIFIC- OR RAISE SOME SPECIFIC IDEAS- WITH REGARDS TO THE EXPECTATION THAT WE SHOULD- THE WE COULD HAVE. WHETHER WE MONITOR MORE OF THE COMPLAINTS- OR ALL THE COMPLAINTS VERSUS THIRTY PERCENT- FOR THE QUALITY OF THE- LOCAL IN CURRY'S OF WHETHER THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THEY SHOULD WE SHOULD MONITOR THE REPORTS OR MONITOR THE INQUIRIES THAT ARE BEING MADE. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THOSE- FINANCIAL. I'M SORRY TO THE O. I. G. YES. IN REGARDS TO THE LOCAL ENQUIRIES OUT. ONCE WE REVIEW THE PROPOSALS PUT FORTH BY CDCR WE REALIZED THERE WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES THAT WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE LOCAL DESIGNATED AND INVESTIGATORS- WE HAVE GONE BACK TO THE TABLE AND- WE'VE REACHED OUT AND FINANCES- WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THEM OUR CONCERN. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUPPORTIVE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO. MONITOR THE ENQUIRIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN REGARDS TO THE BELIEVE 30% IS SUFFICIENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY HIGH VOLUME OF CASES- AND WE BELIEVE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCESS IS ACTUALLY. OUT WORKING AND WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS FOLLOWING THEIR NEWLY IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS. AND DO YOU HAVE ALREADY AN IDEA AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELECT THOSE THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE. WE'VE KIND OF PUT TOGETHER AND SKETCHED OUT IS THAT WE WILL DO A RANDOM SELECTION AND WE WILL JUST LOOK AT THE- CASES THAT ARE GOING TO THAT THE- ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT DOES THE COMPLEX CASES WILL ALSO LOOK AT THE CASES THAT ARE BEING SENT BACK. TO THE INSTITUTIONS TO THE LOCALLY DESIGNATED INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSISTENTLY BY THE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM. OKAY EARN THANK IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO AGAIN TO THE ISSUE THAT- OF MOST OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT WILL CONTINUE TO BE HANDLED AT THE PRESENT LEVEL- WHICH HAS BEEN A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE RAISED IN THE PAST- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS- THAT YOU LOOK TO TAKE TO ENSURE QUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IN INDEED THERE IS- SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING OF COURSE AS SPOKEN ABOUT WE HAVE CENTRALIZED SCREENING WHICH MEANS THAT WE WILL BE HAVING EVERY SINGLE ALLEGATION GOES THROUGH THAT CENTRALIZED SCREENING PROCESS. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE WILL HAVE CONSISTENCY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT GOES BACK TO THE LOCAL INSTITUTION THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING SO BEFORE IF SOMETHING WENT BACK TO THE LOCAL INSTITUTION TO BE ADDRESSED. IT WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN BY THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR ANYBODY ELSE IN LAST HIRING AUTHORITY FELT LIKE IT NEEDED TO GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. BUT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE STAFF COMPLAINTS ANSWERED THOROUGHLY COMPLETELY WITHOUT A BIAS WE NOW WITH THIS NEW PROCESS WILL REQUIRE THAT ONCE THAT LOCAL PROCESSES DONE. THAT REPORT HAS TO COME TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THE SAME MANAGERS THAT ARE REVIEWING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE BEING DONE BY- I AIN'T WILL ALSO BE. LOCAL WORRIES BY THE INSTITUTE. THOSE MANAGERS ARE TO REVIEW FOR THE SAME STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITH THEIR INVESTIGATORS IN ADDITION TO THAT IF THEY SEE CONCERNS THEY CAN EITHER SEND IT BACK AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL IN QUERY WORK. OR THEY MAY DECIDE TO KEEP IT IN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND PUT IT THROUGH. A MORE FORMAL FULL INVESTIGATION PROCESS IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. AND THEN FINALLY THE THIRD THING THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE CREATED A CENTRALIZED DATABASE FOR EVERY SINGLE ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AND THAT REALLY GIVES US AS A DEPARTMENT THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT TRENDS IDENTIFY IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR STAFF MEMBER THAT HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A PARTICULAR LOCATION OR INSTITUTION THAT IS SEEMS TO BE HAVING MULTIPLE ISSUES- SO WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND TRENDS AND REALLY DIVE DOWN INTO THAT AS WELL SOMETHING WE NEVER HAD BEFORE. SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER ARE GOING TO. HELP US NOT ONLY WITH THE ENTIRE PROCESS BUT ALSO. WE MONITOR THAT WORK THAT YOU DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RECOGNIZING THAT. FOR THOSE LESSER AND LESS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE FOR IT TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE INSTITUTION AND TO BE AND FOR THE INCREASE TO HAPPEN AT THE INSTITUTION. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER. AND PROVIDE THE FACTS NEEDED FOR HIRING AUTHORITY TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION. OKAY THANK YOU WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS NEW PROCESS- WE WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT THAT TRANSPARENCY. AND THE OPPORTUNITY IT ALSO IS AN OPPORTUNITY HIGHLIGHT PROGRESS. THAT WILL BE MADE SO- I'M SORRY OF THE L. EIGHT L. A- DEPART MISSED ON. THANK YOU MA'AM JUST ONE TO. MAKE A QUICK CLARIFICATION- BECAUSE I THINK OUR RECOMMENDATION MAY HAVE BEEN MISS CHARACTERIZED OR MISUNDERSTOOD IN THAT CONVERSATION IS THAT ALRIGHT WITH UNIFY YES BY YOU SEE THAT RIGHT IF I'M SORRY FIGHT CONTRIBUTED TO THAT NO NO I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE CASE. IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM- TO UNDERSTAND AND THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES I'M AND I AM NOT NOT SETTING CLEARLY BUT- SO UNDER DAY AND THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER WHICH ALSO MAKES IT COMPLICATED SO- SO UNDER CDC OURS PROPOSAL. BERMAN IS EXPECTING TO ABOUT TWO AND TWENTY. THOUSAND CLAIMS ANNUALLY FROM VARIOUS SOURCES OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CLAIMS. UNDER THE EIGHT AND UNDER AND- WITHIN THAT PROPOSAL CDCR INDICATES THAT- ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM WOULD BE REGULAR GRIEVANCES- AND THEN BEYOND THAT THE REST OF THE CLAIMS OUR REQUEST FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION UNDER THAT AMERICA AND- AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT- HEALTH CARE GRIEVANCES. AND OTHER CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY. ACCORDING TO MONITOR 30% OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND REGULAR GRIEVANCES AND SO WE'RE JUST ASKING WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT THEM TO MONITOR 30% OF ALL TYPES OF ALL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND CLAIMS AS OPPOSED TO JUST THAT ONE TYPE- I THINK IT WAS MAYBE STATED THAT WE WERE SUGGESTING THAT- I. G. B. RESOURCE TO. MONITOR A 100% OF CLAIMS BUT WE'RE JUST SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS THE 30% SHOULD APPLY OR SOME OTHER PERCENT TO A FULL SPECTRUM OF CLAIMS- BECAUSE BASED ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES. IF YOU WERE TO APPLY THOSE RESOURCES TO THE FULL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND CLAIMS THEY'D ONLY BE ABLE TO MONITOR. ABOUT 20% OF CLAIMS SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THANK YOU OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK YOU READY TO MOVE ON- COLLEAGUES ANY FINAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR- FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND PRESENTATIONS THE NEXT ISSUE IS NUMBER TWO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WE HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN RAMCHARAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMRIK SINGH INSPECTOR GENERAL. OUR PROPOSAL FOR MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR EIGHTEEN POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WE BEGAN CONDUCTING INSPECT INSPECTIONS OF THE MEDICAL CARE AT STATE PRISONS AND IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE WERE GIVEN STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT OBJECTIVE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. AND METRIC ORIENTED MEDICAL INSPECTIONS TO REVIEW THE DELIVERY OF MEDICAL CARE AT EACH PRESENT. OUR INSPECTIONS. ARE COMPLETED IN CYCLE ANY CYCLE TAKES ABOUT THREE TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS TO COMPLETE. THE INSPECTION PROCESS ENTAILS MULTIPLE- MULTIPLE PARKS- WE COLLECT DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT WE PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THAT DATA AND CREATED A SAMPLE. FOR FURTHER REVIEW IN TESTING AND WE HAVE CLINICAL CASE REVIEW OF THAT SAMPLE TO DETERMINE IF THE CARE IS CONSISTENT WITH PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS WE CONDUCT COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENTATION TO DETERMINE IF THE CARE IS CONSISTENT WITH DEPARTMENTAL POLICY AND THEN WE DO ON SITE TESTING AND THE PROVISION OF CARE. WE TAKE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION THAT IS OBTAINED AND OBSERVE AND WE REVIEW IT WE COMPLETE OUR TESTING ON THAT DETERMINE THE ACCURACY AND THEN WE PREPARE WRITTEN REPORTS IT IS THAT LENGTHY PROCESS TO CONDUCT ALL OF THE STEPS WHICH TAKES A COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS. SINCE TWO AND ELEVEN THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL CARE OF INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS AT TELEHEALTH SERVICE AND- THERE'S A HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT PROGRAM HOSPICE. UNIT JUST TO NAME A FEW THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE THAT TIME. OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL IS SEEKING TO ACHIEVE OUR NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST IT. TO CREATE A MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT WAS NEVER ESTABLISHED- IN OUR MEDICAL INSPECTION UNITS SPECIFICALLY OR SEEKING A SUPERVISOR FOR OUR NURSING OUR CLASSIFICATIONS. THANK WE WILL NEED TO A OUR CURRENT STAFF WITH THE SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CLINICAL STAFF TO SPEED UP OUR INSPECTION CYCLE WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFF WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OUR INSPECTIONS WITHIN A TWO YEAR CYCLE AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT THREE TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS PROPERLY ALIGNED STAFF TO COMPLETE THE COMPACT. DATA SAMPLING AND SORTING OF HEALTHCARE RELATED DATA THAT'S RECEIVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHICH BASICALLY FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR REVIEWS. THE COLOR OF OUR REFUSES TO PROVIDE NEUTRAL AND OBJECTIVE- REVIEW OF THE HEALTH CARE- THAT'S PROVIDED IN IN THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. WE PROVIDE A WINDOW TO THE PUBLIC INTO THE CARE THAT'S PROVIDED TO THE INCARCERATED PERSONS. AND WE PROVIDE REPORTS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. I REQUEST FOR THESE EIGHTEEN POSITIONS IS BASED ON DATA THAT WE OBTAINED FROM OUR CURRENT CYCLE WHICH IS CYCLE SIX WHICH IS STILL ONGOING AT THE TIME OF OUR REQUEST. WE HAD ONLY COMPLETED ABOUT- WITH COMPLETE TWELVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE THIRTY FOUR. INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- WE ANTICIPATE DOING MORE TIME KEEPING TO GATHER MORE DATA. ON TO. LIKELY SUBMIT A FUTURE PROPOSAL FOR ONGOING RESOURCES BUT AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE IF WE CAN GET THE EIGHTEEN POSITIONS- STARTED WE WILL BE ABLE TO- SHORTEN OUR INSPECTION CYCLE. AND PROVIDE MORE TIMELY REPORTS TO THE IT STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I AM OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- THE FINAL PLEASE. UGH MORE BRAND CODY I JUST ECHO AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S COMMENTS- THE MINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE- I. G. HAS RESOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF ITS MEDICAL INSPECTIONS OF CDCR INSTITUTIONS AND ANTICIPATES RETURNED TO THE LEGISLATURE WILLFUL PROPOSAL TO MAKE PERMANENT RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE O.

PERSONALLY SO AS INSPECTOR GENERAL MENTIONED AT THE TIME BUT THE PROPOSAL WAS REVIEWED- THERE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF- INSPECTION CYCLE SIX AND THEY HAD TWELVE- TWELVE INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY COMPLETED INSPECTIONS FOR- AND- DURING DURING THAT TIME BUT THEY ALSO HAD CHALLENGES WITH- KIND OF CONDUCT A MEDICAL INSPECTIONS IN THE MIDST OF A- THE- THE PANDEMIC- AN EMPLOYMENT COMPONENT AT A NEW TIME KEEPING SYSTEM TO TRACK THE RESOURCES. SO AS THEY THEY COMPLETE THE SPIN CYCLE THIRD THIRD- WORK WORK WE HAVE PROVIDED RESOURCE ON A- TEMPORARY BASIS- FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL. WORK WITH WERE MORE COURSE AND- I.

IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH OUR WORKLOAD WE HAVE HAD TO BE DRAGGED UP TO SEVEN STAFF MEMBERS AT ANY GIVEN TIME TO ASSESS- THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED AND TO ASSIST THE UNIT FROM NOT FALLING FAR BEHIND AND HAVING A BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS RECEIPT WE HAVE ALSO HISTORICALLY RELIED ON A NUMBER OF STUDENTS JUST DANCE WHO HAVE BEEN GREAT HOWEVER WE DO NEED TO RELY ON A PERMANENT WORKFORCE. WE ARE ASKING THAT THE ADDITION OF TO ASSOCIATE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERALS- ARE ARE COMMITTED FOR OUR UNIT BECAUSE THEY WILL HELP ASSIST US TO HANDLE THE INCREASED VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS CLASSIFICATION IS MORE SKILLED THAN AN ANALYST AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX CASES THAT WE RECEIVE- COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVE SOME WHICH I CAN TAKE UP TO TWO. HOURS TO REVIEW. THIS IS ALSO A POSITION THAT I WE BE TRAIN. A TRAINING IN BY. AS IT HELP TO OUR STAFF MEMBERS AND IT WILL HELP US TO. OUR RECRUITING RETAIN WELL QUALIFIED PEOPLE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I AM ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL. GREAT AND I HAVE. ONE MORE OF A- MISSING BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HERE- DICKS FACT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS- TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE- AND DO YOU WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY. IT IS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. ALL. REYES INSPECTOR GENERAL I HATE I BELIEVE THE NUMBER HAVE COME COMPLAINTS HAVE INCREASED- WE'VE GOTTEN MORE- COUNTLESS IN INFORMATION OUT INTO THE INSTITUTIONS WE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE GOTTEN POSTERS PUT INTO EACH OF THE INSTITUTIONS AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER WE HAVE A WEBSITE- SO WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE OUT INTO THE INSTITUTIONS TO INCARCERATED PERSONS NOW THAT THEIR- THEY DO HAVE A CHANNEL AVAILABLE TO THEM. IF THEY ARE ARE UNABLE TO OR OR WITH OR JUST NEED AN EXTRA LAYER OF OVER SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THEIR AND SO WE'VE PROVIDED A NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO THE GEERAL PUBLIC AND TO THE INCARCERATED POPULATION AND I BELIEVE NOW THAT THEY HAVE- HAVE THE ACCESS TO MAKE COMPLAINTS TO DIRECTLY TO THE O. I. G. AT LEAST THIS IS. PART OF THE- A REASON WHY ARE COMPLETE HAVE HAVE DOUBLED IN LAST FOUR YEARS. OKAY GOOD I MEAN IT'S GOOD AND HOPEFULLY THAT LEADS TO THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO AVOID THE COMPLAINTS IN THE FUTURE- OKAY ZANZA. COLLEAGUES IN THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU MEASURE SO A KEY QUESTION ON- THE MEDICAL INSPECTION UNIT SPECIFICALLY THE CYCLE THAT THE NOTE- THE NOTES. NOTE THAT IT TAKES A PROBABLY THREE AND A HALF THREE TO THREE TO HAVE YEARS TO COMPLETE THE FULL CYCLE OF MEDICAL INSPECTIONS- SO. WHY SO LONG IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY LONG TIME- AND IS IT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES IF SOMEBODY KNOWS. MAYBE MR CODY RATIONING. WHO WOULD WHO WOULD LIKE TO- IS BACK TO GENERAL MISSING I ALL START OFF WITH THAT- THE PROCESS TAKES A LONG TIME BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF DATA THAT WE RECEIVE AND GOING THROUGH THE DATA TO CREATE A SAMPLE SIZE- WE HAVE WE REALLY GO THROUGH THE- REVIEWS THESE CASE REVIEWS THAT WE DO OUR VERY THOROUGHLY. AND TIMELY THERE IS REALLY NO MANDATE TO COMPLETE THESE REVIEWS IN A CERTAIN TIME ON THERE ISN'T A SPEED REQUIREMENTS- BUT WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE TO LOOK DO DETAILED REVIEWS OF THE SAMPLE THAT WE GET. THE DATA THAT WE GET A REASONABLE SAMPLE AND THEN WE HAVE CLINICIANS THAT REVIEWED THE DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE WE LOOK AT STANDARD OF CARE WE LOOK AT DEPARTMENT POLICY WE LOOK AT BEN ON SITE AND HOW HE CARRIES BEING HANDLED ON SITE SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF STEPS AND IT TAKES OF COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET THROUGH AN INSPECTION THESE- INDICATOR QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACCURATE- WE DO A LOT OF BACK AND- ACCURACY CHECKS AS WELL BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING DATA THAT IS RELIABLE AND INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN RELY ON I'M SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY IT TAKES A VERY LENGTHY AMOUNT OF TIME. AND OF COURSE THE REPORT WRITING ALSO ADDS AN EXTRA LAYER OF A NUMBER OF DAYS- CLINICIANS AREN'T NECESSARILY REPORT WRITERS AND SO IT DOES TAKE OUR EDITORS- ALONG WITH OUR CLINICIANS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE READABLE REPORTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY- PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT IS BENEFICIAL. THANK YOU VERY SERVICES CHATHAM INTO AGAIN SEEMS TO ME THREE HAVE YEARS IS QUITE A LONG TIME AND THE TIME YOU COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES BOTH THE PERSONAL BUT ALSO. PROCESS AND- PRESS OF. THERE IS SOME THOUGHT MIGHT BE GIVEN TO TRYING TO COMPRESS THE TIME LINE IN ORDER TO MAKE FINE USED AND WILL. IT WHATEVER PRICE YOU WHATEVER ABOUT COME OUT OF THAT- IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE OTHERWISE IT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GET STUCK IN A BIT OF A LOOP. WHO MISS. MISSING DO YOU HAVE ANY OF SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO SPEED THAT UP. THAT IS THE BASIS FOR OUR PROPOSAL A PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE WANT TO SPEED UP THESE THESE INSPECTIONS WE WANT TO SPEED UP THE CYCLES- WE HAD STAKEHOLDERS ACTUALLY REACH OUT AND ASK FOR US TO TRY AND SPEED UP THIS PROCESS- AND- WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOMMENDATIONS AND INFORMATION IS BENEFICIAL TO ALL- WHEN IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE I POINT OUT THAT. IF THE O. I. G. EFFORT FOR CLINICIANS OBSERVE SOMETHING AT THE TIME OF OUR INSPECTION OR THE TIME OF OUR REVIEWS THAT WE FEEL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY WE DO TAKE THAT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE THAT DEPART OF THE INSTITUTIONAL STAFF WE MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE IS ANYTHING- FOR EXAMPLE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT OR ANYTHING THAT WE REVIEW THAT WE FEEL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY WE DO LET THE DEPARTMENT NOW SO WEAK WE DON'T WAIT THREE TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS TO SAY. BY THE WAY TWO YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED WE ENSURE. THAT THAT INFORMATION IS TIMELY PROVIDED. IF AB I GUESS THAT'S YOU KNOW THE THREE HAVE YEARS JUST CURRENT. ITERATION WHAT'S THE ASPIRATION WHAT ARE WE WORKING TOWARD. I WAS LESS THAN THREE AND A HALF YEARS BUT DID YOU KNOW THERE SHOULD BE. A STANDARD GOAL YOU'RE WORKING TOWARD WHICH IS THE BOTTOM OUT OF TIME FOR TURN AROUND IN THIS COUNTRY FORGE. MISSING YES YES WE ARE- THE GOAL IS TO HEAR ABOUT IT THIS PROPOSAL. IS HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN. MOVE TO A TWO YEAR PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO THREE TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS YOU. OKAY I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS ISSUE- THANK YOU ALL AGAIN VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE AND THIS IS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS AND STAFFING AND WE WILL START WITH A C. D. C. R. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- MY NAME'S CHRIS LEAVES ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR. SAUDI PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION. SCDC OUR REQUEST TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN. CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN- CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL IMPLEMENT ADA TRANSITION PLANS FOR THESE DISABILITY PLACEMENT PROGRAM DESIGNATED INSTITUTIONS- THESE TRANSITION PLANS WERE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE FACILITIES FOR A CURSORY INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES THAT PROVIDE THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. SHE PLANS FOR DEVELOPMENT PLAINTIFFS IN ARMSTRONG FEDERAL CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE GOT A JERK WAS ON ON TO EXPLAIN THE OTHER. THANK YOU. I'M SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HELLO MY NAME S JOURNALISM ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FACILITY SUPPORT IN THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. THE CDC OUR END OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE REQUESTING FUNDING IN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT MANDATED AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OR ADA REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AT VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS. CDCR CCHS IS POLICIES INSURING CARS RATED INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO PROGRAMS SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH EIGHTY REQUIREMENTS. WELL IN CURSORY DID. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE OFTEN REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FROM STAFF. IT'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES RESOURCES TO ENSURE CDCR IN CCHS CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF CARE INFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS TOWARDS THE DISTANT BUT DISABLED POPULATION MY COLLEAGUE KAMAL SINGH THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITY OPERATIONS CORRECTIONAL SERVICES BUT CCHS IN HIGH ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL. THANK THANK YOU MISTER LOZANO- WILL HAVE SOMEONE FROM FINANCE PLEASE FINANCE. MINISTRATION SUPPORTS THESE PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS AND THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED INCARCERATED POPULATION IN ADDITION THAT WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARMSTRONG TRANSITION PLAN. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU- THE LA OFFICE PLEASE. WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS SPECIFIC TO THESE TWO PROPOSALS HOWEVER I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT ONE OF THEM I DOES INVOLVE A MODIFICATION TO PRESENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED ON FRIDAY A REPORT- ARTICULATING ITS- ITS ANTICIPATED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. SO WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT REPORT- AND ARE REVIEWING ALL INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATION PROPOSALS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INFORMATION IN THAT REPORT AND- WHEN WE REACH RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE WILL CAN COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE COMMITTEE. SO THE EXPECTATION THAT THESE ISSUES WILL BE BROUGHT UP IN THAT REPORT. THE EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY A NOT NOT NECESSARILY EASY ISSUE SPECIFICALLY BUT JUST- IS A REPORT THAT CDCR RECENTLY SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH IT'S- PRAYER IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITIZING- INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATION AT- PRISONS THAT IT'S EXPECTED PROJECTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO COST OVER FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND SO WE WOULDN'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE OUR OR- WE WOULD LIKELY SEEK TO AVOID SITUATIONS WHERE THAT- YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS FROM NOW THE STATE IS GOING TO- OR DEMONSTRATIONS GOING TO PROPOSE. AB FUNDAMENTALLY RENOVATING A FACILITY THAT WE JUST ADDED ADA MODIFICATIONS TO- SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE'RE JUST WE JUST WANT. TO LOOK OUT FOR- FORECLOSE OFFICIAL FOR. IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THANK YOU MISS ON IT AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF ASKING FOR THE PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE. TIME FOR CLOSURES BECAUSE IT IMPACTS CAPITAL OUTLAYS- AND- RATES AND SAID IT CENTER- THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- SHATTER DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD YOU MIND IF I RESPOND- OKAY SURE THANK YOU- THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING CORE COMPLIANCE PROVIDE THE INCARCERATED PERSONS WITH BETTER ACCESS WITHIN THESE INSTITUTIONS. WITH THAT BEING SAID THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE SENSITIVITY OR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES WITH THE PRESENT POPULATION PROJECTED TO DECLINE IN THE FUTURE YEARS HOWEVER THIS IS JUST ONE COMPONENT TO CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT CLOSING I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S UNWISE TO PIES INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING. GIVEN CONSIDERABLE FUTURE UNCERTAINTY AND A CRITICAL NEED FOR THESE MODIFICATIONS EVEN AS THE POPULATION DECLINES IN FUTURE YEARS I WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO AGE WHICH WILL LIKELY KEEP THE DEMAND FOR THESE ADA. COMPLIANCE CHANGES HI. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IT WILL BE GOOD THOUGH TO INCLUDE ALL OF THESE ISSUES AS WE GO FORWARD WITH A PLAN- AFTER THE PROPOSED PROJECTS AND STAFFING INCREASES. HOW FAR IS CDC ARE IN REACHING A FULL ADA COMPLIANCE. ON THE DISABILITY SIDE- WE WILL HAVE- A FUTURE- BUDGET ASKS FOR- IMPROVEMENTS AT EIGHT OR NINE OTHER INSTITUTIONS- AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WILL- THOSE REQUESTS WILL BE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AT ONE PM AND ANNUAL.

BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL A RECENT REVIEW OF- MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT PARTICIPANT NUMBERS INDICATES THAT THE I. S. U. T. T. PROGRAM REMAINS ON TARGET TO REACHED A NEARLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MATT PARTICIPANTS BY JUNE. THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS BY- JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR INCREMENTAL CHANGES IN THE I GUESS YOU DO YOUR PART TO SOME POP PARTICIPANT POPULATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR END ACCORDINGLY- THIS PROPOSAL ASSUMES THE SPECIFIC. LEVEL OF POPULATION DRIVEN RESOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM WILL BE ADJUSTED EACH YEAR STARTING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AS PART OF THE ANNUAL POPULATION ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THE. ADMINISTRATION ALSO NOTES THAT THIS. IT'S AN INVESTMENT TECH- I ISSUE DEPOT WILL SUPPORT BETTER. PROVIDE BETTER CRIMINALS OUTCOMES AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THANK YOU MR CODY CAN WE HAVE- SOMEONE FROM- LA- PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS YEAH MY NAME'S ORLANDO SANCHEZ BUT THE L. A. L. WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND AND MODIFY THAT NAY GRADED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM AS MARRIAGE HOWEVER BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD MODIFY THE PROPOSAL. YOUR FIRST RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE A REVISED PROPOSAL AT THE MAY REVISION. THAT IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE UPDATED PROJECTIONS FUNDING BEING REQUESTED CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE SIZE OF THE INMATE POPULATION THE PROPOSAL WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED FOR THE POSSIBILITY. OF THE INMATE POPULATION MAY BE LOWER THAN CURRENTLY PROJECTED AS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST HEARING. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO THE EXTENT THE LEISLATURE CHOOSES TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND THE APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT ANY BUDGET FUNDS THAT ARE NOT SPENT REVERT BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. WE WANT TO POINT OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT COULD LIMIT THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. THESE LIMITATIONS COULD RESULT IN A DEPARTMENT NOT USING THE FULL BUDGET AMOUNT. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT IT COULD TAKE LONGER TO FILL THE REQUESTED THREE HUNDRED AND TEN POSITIONS FOR THE PROGRAM. ALSO IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEVEL NECESSARY FOR THE EXPANSION GIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR NOTED SUFFICIENT CLASSROOM SPACE AT THE PRISONS AS A CHALLENGE. AND LASTLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION. FOR THE PROGRAM SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER I S. U. T. T. P. IS EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT YET CLEAR INITIAL DATA SHOWS THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELATED DOZENS HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE DECREASED SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN. AND THE DEPARTMENT ALREADY INTENDS TO PARTNER WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO CALIFORNIA TO VALLEY ASPECTS. FOR WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE- HAVE THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE THESE RESULTS THANK YOU NOT BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER SANCHEZ- COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. SENATE QUARTERS IN THE THINK ABOUT YOUR- QUESTION THE CHEST- IT CERTAINLY. REALLY TO THE BUDGET I GUESS EVERYTHING DOES- I DON'T WANT TO ST TWO FOUR INTO POLICY BUT I'M CURIOUS- IT FOR SOMEBODY- FOR THE PRISONERS CAN FROM CBC ARGUS CAN SPEAK TO- THE OVERDOSE. THE OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT ARE OCCURRING- WHAT IS DONE IT TO ACTUALLY ANALYZE. THIS IS WHAT WENT DOWN IN THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S REFERENCES IN THE MATERIALS HEARING TO THAT RATE IF YOU WILL PER CAPITA BEING HIGHER THAN IT IS OUTSIDE- INTO IN JUST A JUST ONE QUICKLY I DON'T NEED- A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS BECAUSE WE COULD ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION SEPARATELY ON THIS BUT- I'M JUST. IN TERMS OF REDUCING INCIDENTS IN TERMS OF. WHERE DOLLARS ARE GOING HINO TO INTERVENE IN THIS WHOLE AREA HOW MUCH IS JUST- PROCURATOR PUT IT POST MORTEM ANALYSIS ON- WHERE WHERE THE DRUGS CAME FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL CONTENT WAS WITHERED- WHETHER FENTON ALL OR OR OR OTHER- IT OR OR OR OTHER DRUGS SAID THAT WE'VE SEEN- IN IN GROWING NUMBERS. OUTSIDE OF THE CDC OUR SYSTEM OUR- I DISABILITIES OVERDOSE DEATHS BUT AGAIN IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF WHAT'S DONE IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS. YES SENATOR I DO DEFERRED IT AND MY COLLEAGUE DR RANKING ANSIBLE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- MY NAME IS RENEE CANINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR MEDICAL SERVICES I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. ACTUALLY EVERY DEATH THAT OCCURS IN THE INCARCERATED. POPULATION HAS REVIEWED IT- VERY THOROUGHLY BY TERMS OF- OVERDOSES AS YOU HEARD- THANK GOODNESS OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN. SINCE TWENTY TWENTY AND THEY CONTINUE TO GO DOWN- PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS FOUR ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WELL- THE REASON FOR OVERDOSE- WHEN WE HAVE A SUSPECTED OVERDOSE WE ACTUALLY AND DO AN AUTOPSY WE ALSO DO TOXICOLOGY RESULTS AS PART OF THAT OUR REVIEW AND- REALLY THAT THE DRUGS. THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE NOT CHANGED IT'S JUST A MUCH LOWER NUMBER. OF INDIVIDUALS AT THIS TIME- USUALLY HAIR ONE AND OR FENNEL ARE INVOLVED WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH AN OPIOID. RELATED OVERDOSE. WE ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE AN INDEPENDENT. DESK REVIEW DONE BY DOCTOR OF MINE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THAT IS A PUBLIC RECORD. AND THAT IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. AND SO IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN- REVIEWS THAT WE DO ON ALL GAS AND THERE IS THAT INDEPENDENT TOWER RECORDS- AGAIN THE REASON WE DO GET FOR USE IS SO THAT WE CAN LEARN. FROM EVERY GAS WE BELIEVE THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. THE WAY THAT WE ARE DOING THINGS. AND OVERDOSE DEATHS. WE USE THOSE RESULTS TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM AND THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT ARE NOTED IN THE INDEPENDENT RECORD AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTERNAL. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OUR RECORDS- IN EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING. I MEAN IT TAKES MOTHER THANK YOU. ID ONE- BELIEVER THE POINT I APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW YOU JUST GAVE AND I. A PROBABLY- HERE SEPARATELY BETWEEN MEETINGS ALASKA- A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT JUST MORE OF MY OWN CURIOSITY IN IN IN HOW YOU DISCRIMINATE YOU KNOW AFTER THOSE- PREVIEWS BETWEEN- IT MENTAL HEALTH IN INTENTIONAL. MENTAL HEALTH RELATED INTENTIONAL SELF INFLICTION VERSUS- YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHOSE WHOSE DRUGS WERE LACED YOU KNOW IT IT'S SECOND HAVE PERMISSION I'M INTERESTED IN AND AGAIN IT'S PROBABLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH POLICY THAN THIS BUDGET ITEM HERE TODAY SO AGREE IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN IN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THAT REGARD OF QUESTIONS- SOME POSITIONS HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME- AND EXPRESS CONCERN AND DISCOMFORT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IN PARTICULAR OF THE MAT OF COMPONENT OF WHAT IS CDC ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE GETTING THE TRAINING AND THE SUPPORT- AS ESPECIALLY AS OF THE MAP PROGRAM IS. EXPANDING FURTHER. YES HELLO THIS IS RENEE CAN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO YOU KNOW CHANGE IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING- AND THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER 98% OF OUR PHYSICIANS- X. WAVERED WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN PRESCRIBE. AN ORGY AND- MORE THAN 90% OF OUR PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE RIGHT WORKFORCE AND TRANSITION LEADERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRAINED AS WELL. IN ADDITION TO- THE EX WAIVER TRAINING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY- CSX WAIVER- WE ALSO HAVE CREATED- VERY- DETAILED CUSTOMIZED TRAINING. A SERIES OF TRAININGS- FOR OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS STAFF AND AGAIN THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE COMPLETED THAT TRAINING. AND IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS I HAVE ACTUALLY- STARTED TO TREAT THEIR OWN PATIENTS ON THEIR PANEL- REQUIRE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. SO AT THIS POINT ALTHOUGH AGAIN CHANGES IT'S CHALLENGING- WE HAVE SUPPORTED OUR PROVIDER WORKFORCE- GAINAX WAIVERS ARE GETTING TRAINED AND NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ONGOING- TECHNICAL SUPPORT CONSULTATION SUPPORT WE HAVE OFFICE HOURS WE PROVIDE A TWICE A WEEK- WE HAVE- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AVAILABILITY- IF THERE ARE ANY. COMPLICATIONS THAT THE BRIGHTER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WE HAVE A CENTRAL TEAM OF EXPERTS WHO CAN ALSO HELP THEM MANAGE THAT PATIENT. AND I THINK WITH ALL THESE EFFORTS- WE ARE SEEN I'M REALLY QUITE A BIT OF BUY IN FROM THE PROVIDER WORKFORCE AT THIS POINT- IN TERMS OF BEING INVOLVED IN THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT SOUND REALLY SHOWING. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- AFFECTED AFFECTED US. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. WELL I THINK IT'S AN BOB IT MAY BE AN ONGOING ISSUE SO I REALLY- OR DO YOU TO KEEP ON WORKING I'M SURE AS YOU KNOW KEEP ON WORKING WITH THE POSITIONS ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY RAISED WERE YOU KNOW WITH A DISTURBING. TO SAY THE LEAST AS FAR AS- THERE- HAVING TO PARTICIPATE WHEN THEY DIDN'T AGREE WELL WITH. WITH THE PROGRAM ITSELF OR NOT WITH THE PROGRAM AS MUCH AS IT WAS ON INDIVIDUAL CASES SO I JUST URGE YOU TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE CONCERNS OF THE OF YOUR PHYSICIANS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. MOM AND IF WE COULD HAVE JUST A REAL REAL QUICK ON THE OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- WHAT INFORMATION CAN OUR LEGISLATURE HAVE TO- EXPECT TO GET TO ASSESS THE PROGRAM. HI YES.

ADDITIONAL BE HOLD HIM FOR IN A- OF A- IN NOT ONLY TO MAKE THE PART OF THE PLAY- THE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR A CD ARE SO BUT TO MAKE SURE IT'S FOR- I THINK. I THINK. WHAT'S MORE THAN ANECDOTAL BUT I THINK SO MUCH OF WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF SITUATIONS THAT DON'T GO RIGHT. OR THEY GO HORRIBLY WRONG- HILL INVOLVING RECIDIVISM OR INVOLVING YOU KNOW SOME. SOME FORM OF VIOLENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SEEMS TO TIE BACK TO. IN ANOTHER LINE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION THAT PEOPLE JUST WEREN'T READY TO. WELCOME TO PUT THE PROPER WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN PLACE OR TO A PAID EXTRA ATTENTION TO WITH THAT IN ME WHEN THEY GET TO THE COUNTY LEVEL SO- THAT'S THE- MOTIVATION FOR MY QUESTION I JUST WANNA- I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO STATUTORILY TO- TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND IN TO TAKE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES OUT OF WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN PUSH DOWN THE COULD THE COUNTIES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY BECOMES OR SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE ANYWAY. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT- THE PRACTICE SHOULD BE- HERE AT LEAST WITHIN THE TWO ENTITIES- NO A FREEFORM KIND OF SHARING OF THE KIND OF INFORMATION BUT- THOSE ARE MY OPINIONS. IN A PREDICAMENT TO THE QUESTIONS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THERE NEWMAN. OKAY OKAY GREAT- I JUST TERM I KNOW MR CODY MENTIONED THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT TO A LOT MORE DETAIL TO BE PUT ON THIS EXPECT TO DO THAT FOR THE WITH THE MAY REVISE- MAYBE I'LL JUST ADD TO THE SOME O THE QUESTIONS THAT THE L. A. L. ASKED- PRESENTED ON SOME OF THEM IF YOU CAN ANSWER NOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT OTHERWISE- I THINK THAT THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE EXPECT AND NEED TO BE ANSWERED- IF. HOW WILL THIS INITIATIVE BE ALIGNED WITH- THE EXISTING PRE AND POST RELEASE PROGRAMS OF- AND WHAT NEW PRESS A PRE RELEASE ACTIVITIES NOT ALREADY UP PERFORMED BY CDCR WILL BE PART OF THIS INITIATIVE AND OUT WHAT ARE THE KEY BARRIERS AND CONNECTING PATIENTS TO SERVICES UPON THEIR RELEASE AND HOW WILL THIS INITIATIVE ADDRESS THOSE.

I THINK WILL WORK WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND COLLEAGUES FOUND THAT AND FROM THE FINANCE AND SELF PARKING FINANCING RIGHT NOW. THAT WAS COOL. THIS IS ALICE IN HUMAN FROM THE OF FINANCE IF I CAN JUST ADD IT TO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. I'M MORE HAPPY ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING PUBLISHED I THINK THOUGH EVEN IF THE ALEJO WOULD LIKELY CONCEDE THAT THERE'S- SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IS JUST NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE I BRING CODY MENTIONED. THE EIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE CALLINAN IT SHOULD HAVE. SO UNLIKE MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BRINGS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS CASE WERE LACKING SOME OF THOSE KEY DETAILS AND IT'S JUST AN ISSUE THAT REALLY RELATES TO THE POINT IN TIME AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T NOW THAT WERE ABLE TO SPEAK TO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU SEE OUR IS IT DOING INCREDIBLE DUE DILIGENCE IT'S JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN A TIMING ISSUE WHERE. THIS INITIATIVE ISN'T NECESSARILY LINING UP WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY RESPOND TO ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS AS WERE ABLE TO BUT YOU MIGHT SEE SOME UNKNOWNS AT THIS TIME BECAUSE WE'RE JUST NOT ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT AND ARE PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT BUT WE ARE COMMITTED. TO SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE L. A. L. AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS AND SOME OF THE- COVERAGE SERVICES AND OTHER DETAILS THAT ARE STILL. OUTSTANDING- ARE DETERMINES. THANK YOU MISS YOU IT GUESS- THE OBVIOUSLY A- IS A- HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THESE PROPOSALS SO. LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FURTHER INFORMATION THANK YOU.

PROVIDING ROWLEY IS A SAFE PLACE TO TRANSITION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE REINTEGRATION. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES FUNDING ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS.

THE JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR CDC ARE- WHAT STEPS CAN YOU TAKE- TO HELP PEOPLE SECURE MORE PERMANENT HOUSING- PRE RELEASE. TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY HOUSING. AND- ARE THERE ENOUGH PLACEMENTS FOR THE ANTICIPATED HOUSING NEED APPRECIATED THANK YOU. OF COURSE THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION- AS FAR AS WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE HOUSING NEED- ONE OF THE THINGS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO IT IS CONTINUE TO USE OUR- OTHER ENTRY OPTIONS WITH THE MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS AND THE COMMUNITY- ARTISTIC COMMUNITY TRANSITION PROGRAMS. WHICH ALLOW US TO HELP- OUR RESIDENTS TRANSITION BACK HOUSING BEFORE THEY RELEASED- AND AS FAR AS FINDING HOUSING FOR THEM IF THEY END UP IN THIS PROGRAM RETURNING HOME. OUR PARTNERS- I'M IN THE STOCK PROGRAMS WORK WITH LOCAL. SERVICES TO GET THEM PERMANENT HOUSING. ON A PERMANENT. AND I YOUR NEXT QUESTION. WAS DO WE HAVE ENOUGH BASIS FOR WHAT WE DO HAVE NUMEROUS BEDS IN OUR STOCK PROGRAM CURRENTLY WE ONLY HAVE FUNDING FOR A PORTION OF THOSE BEDS- AND THIS WILL ADDED TO THE ADDITIONAL BEDS THAT WE CAN USE SO. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THE NEED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO HEARING NONE OKAY WELL AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CIESZYN AND OTHERS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND PRESENTATION THE MOVE ON NOW TO. ISSUE- NINE THE CALIFORNIA PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY JANITORIAL EXPANSION CDCR PLEASE FACILITIES PLANNING APPLICATION MANAGEMENT CCHS IS REQUESTING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE JANITORIAL SERVICES CONTRACT WITH LPA THIS CONTRACT PROVIDES FOR THE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING AND SANITIZING. IN CARE AREAS IN INSTRUCTION HEALTH CARE LOCATIONS THESE RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT NECESSARY STAFFING LEVELS AND RECOGNIZE THE ADDITIONAL SERVICE LOCATIONS NAMELY THE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT PROGRAM. SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. STANDALONE DENTAL CLINICS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED MEDICAL SPACE HFM PROGRAM OFFENDERS PROPOSED INCARCERATION EMPLOYMENT THROUGH A CERTIFIED HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY CAL PA STAFF. WITH THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEWIS OF FINANCE PLEASE. I SIMPLY MENDOZA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF CLEANING SERVICES AND WANT TO NOTE THAT THE CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORY RATIOS RANGE- ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AN AVERAGE ABOUT FORTY INCARCERATED IN CIVIL SERVICE CUSTODIAN STOPPED TWO ONE CIVIL SERVICES CUSTODIAN SUPERVISOR. IT PROVIDES RE POSITIONS ARE ABOUT OVERSIGHT STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING. LPI IS GOALS ARE TRUTHFUL WELL THERE IS NO DOUBT HELPED GUYS GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A QUALITY JANITORIAL SERVICES AND THEY'RE DOING SO THEIR MISSION IS TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS PRODUCTIVE WORK AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR PLAYABILITY POSTING COURSE RATIONS. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SUPERVISORS WOULD ALLOW CALPE ITEM GROUP THE QUALITY- THAT CALCULATE PROVIDES. AND CLEANING SERVICES TO BETTER MEET THEIR MISSION BY PROVIDING MORE FEEDBACK ON THE JOB TRAINING CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF INVENTORY AND PROCESS THESE. AS WELL AS FINDING AND KEEPING QUALIFIED STAFF. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE THAT RATIO FROM FORTY TO ONE TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO ONE- AND WOULD ALLOW CALCULATED BY THAT EXPECTED SUPERVISION THAT'S NEEDED THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. WAS OFTEN PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS WE VIEW THIS PROPOSAL AS HAVING TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT EXPANDS THE CONTRACT CONTINUE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THE SECOND IS THAT HE PROPOSES TO CHANGE THE RATIO OF CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS TAKE A STUDY AND STAFF AND WE ASSESS THE PROPOSAL IN THESE TWO COMPONENTS. GIVEN THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CAL PA THAT THEY HAPPEN NEXT AT AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD AND NOT RAISED MAJOR CONCERNS WE FIND THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE CONTRACTS INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES REASONABLE. WELL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE IMPROVE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND INTO NEW HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THIS REGARD. HOWEVER THE SECOND PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE RATIO OF CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS TAKE A STARTING. APPEARS ANALYSIS. THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE FUNDING NECESSARY CHANGE THE RATIO OF CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS TAKE A STARTING STAFF. IN THEIR PROPOSAL CAL PA RAISES PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM LACK OF REACH SUPERVISORS SUCH ISSUES INCLUDING NOT PROPERLY KEEPING INVENTORY NOT PROVIDING TIMELY EVALUATIONS TO CUSTODIANS AND A FEW OTHERS WE KNOW THAT THESE PROBLEMS. REYES HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED WELL WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY COUNTY A COULD IMPACT THE PROGRAM IN OTHER WAYS IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THESE. ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORS PROPOSED WHAT IN FACT ALLEVIATE THOSE PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OTHER ACTIONS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRAINING WOULD ADDRESS THOSE-IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONLY IMPROVE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND INTO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AND DIRECT CAL PA TO REPORT THE AMOUNT REQUESTED ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING THE RACIAL OF SUPERVISORS SEPARATELY WE NOTE THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR ANALYSIS PROVIDE THIS SEPARATE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO- BUT BASED ON LIMITED DATA WE ESTIMATE THAT. THE RATIO IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CHANGING THE SUPERVISOR TO STAFF RATIO THANK AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- MISTER LEWIS COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE L. A. O.'S- ISSUES ON THE SECOND PROPOSAL. WELL YES- WHILE I AGREE WITH US THAT THEY CAN OKAY PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED ADEQUATE SERVICES TO THIS POINT. THERE IS CONCERNS RELATED TO ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT AND TRAINING OF THE FENDERS- WITH THE STAFF THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE- YOU KNOW DELEO SAYS THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING. BUT I WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT THEY RECOMMEND- I THINK STOPS AND GIVEN THAT THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT TO PREPARE OFFENDERS FOR JOBS ON THE OUTSIDE I'M THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MENTORING AND TRAINING TO THE STAFF TO THOSE INMATES STAFF WOULD REALLY HELP THE PROGRAM MEET ITS OBJECTIVES IN PROVIDING. AND THE SKILLS TO THOSE OFFENDERS I'M ADDITIONALLY- TELL YOUR CRACK THAT THERE IS SEVERAL DOLLAR RELATED TO. THESE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORY POSITIONS ABOUT THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT NINE AND SECOND YEAR- THAT IS THE AMOUNT RELATED TO THE INCREASED. RATIO OF SUPERVISION- BUT WE DO FEEL THAT THOSE THOSE. I AM. REQUESTS ARE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT TO THE PROGRAM OVERALL TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES. CORRECT ARM THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LEWIS- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ARE THE INCARCERATED PERSONS WHO WORK IN THESE JOBS. ABLE TO BE HIRED ON AS A CIVIL SERVICE CUSTODIANS POST RELEASE- I KNOW IT IT IT IT FROM WHAT YOU ALL SAY THAT THE- YOU KNOW. PART OF THE MISSION OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS TO ENHANCE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES- TO BE ABLE TO GET A WORK WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED SO. HOW ARE THEY SUPPORTED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO FIND WORK POST RELEASE- WHETHER IT'S CIVIL SERVICE OR PRIVATE POSITIONS AND YOU KNOW HOW DOES HOW DO YOU HOW ARE YOU HELPING THEM. HOW AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IS THE PROGRAM IN HELPING THEM. GET TO THEIR GOALS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A JOB ON THAT'S IN THERE AFTER THEY'RE RELEASED- I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC ANSWERS I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET SOME INFORMATION FROM CAL PA. ASSOCIATED WITH- WITH THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS AND SUCCESS ON PLACING OFFENDERS- IN GENERAL WE DON'T HAVE- A LOT OF JANITORIAL POSITIONS AND CDCR. THAT WOULD BE CIVIL SERVICE AND CAN WITH THEIR STATUS AS A AS A FELON DAY WOULD GENERALLY BE DISQUALIFIED FROM WORKING IN PRISONS WITHOUT WITHOUT IT. OUT SOME SORT OF EXCEPTION- BUT I CAN GET ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS FROM CAL PA AS FAR AS THE SUCCESS IN PLACING OFFENDERS AND ANY- EFFORTS THEY MAKE IN TRYING TO GET OFFENDERS JOBS. ON ONCE THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED. OKAY I MEAN I'LL BE. YOU YOU KNOW WE RUN ACROSS THIS ISSUE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT. INDUSTRIES SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY IS HOW DO WE HELP THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED GET A JOB AND SEE THEMSELVES AS HAVING A CAREER. A JOB. THAT PAYS WELL TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP BACK IN PRISON SO- I WOULD REALLY URGE ONE IS TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION. AND YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GO ABOUT. INCREASING THEIR UP CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB POST RELEASE VERSUS YOU KNOW JUST. HAVING GOTTEN THE TRAINING AND THEN WHERE DO THEY END UP WITH THAT HOW WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO THEM IN IN THE WORLD- AFTER THEY'RE RELEASED. K. THANK IN ADVANCE I DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO KNOW AND WHILE I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IN THAT RESPECT. THIS IS A SPECIALIZED- TRAINING THAT THEY GET AND THE HEALTHCARE CLEANING IS SPECIALIZED AND THEY DO RECEIVE- CERTIFICATIONS- ACROSS VARIOUS CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW THEM- AND A GREATER EMPLOYABILITY ONCE THEY'RE OUT. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT THANKS. YES SIR NEWMAN AGENCIES IS THEIR DATA AVAILABLE ON THE POST INCARCERATION POINT. SUCCESS IN MAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AND IF THERE IS NOT SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. SOME DECENT BASIS FOR COLLECTING IT ESPECIALLY THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT MONEY IS SURELY JUSTIFIED IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A POSITIVE IMPACT ON POST INCARCERATION PLAN SCHOOL HARD TO JUST FIVE FOR MY COLLEGE NIGHT IF THERE IS NOT. MR LEWIS OR BUDGET WILL REACH OUT TO CAL PA TO GET ANY INFORMATION THEY HAVE REGARDING POST INCARCERATION IMPLEMENTS- I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA IN FRONT OF ME BUT I WILL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES SIR CORTEZ. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT I THINK THIS AREA. IT IS AGAIN DESPITE THE FACT WERE FOCUS IN A VERY PARTICULAR VERY SPECIFIC BUDGET ITEMS YOU KNOW HAS A TENDENCY TO RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN- WE'RE PROBABLY GETTING THE ANSWER FOR RIGHT NOW- BY THE- I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT IN A- IN A IN A SERIOUS COMMENT I DON'T MEAN IT TO BE- IN ANYWAY- HUH. THIS RESPECTFUL AT ALL PUT QUALIFIED AS AN INMATE TO DO WORK- BASED ON RISK BASED ON TRAINING BASED ON GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS. AND THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD STOP THEM FROM QUALIFYING FOR THE JOB POST RELEASE IS PHONY THAT'S ON THE RECORD I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM- I'M A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT WE'RE EITHER. WE HAVE A SYSTEM PRISON SYSTEM THAT'S PREPARING PEOPLE REHABILITATING THEM OR OR WE DON'T AND- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND- IF THERE'S HIGH RISK- INMATES WERE HIGH RISK FELONS THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE. THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED WOULD NOT BE PRESENTED WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW INSIDE OR OR ELSE- BUT IF. A LITTLE BIT UNFAIR TO TELL SOMEONE. YOUR WORK IS JUST FINE FOR THIRTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR ASSEMBLY IMPRISONED BUT- DON'T BOTHER APPLYING- FOR THE SAME JOB- HERO AS AS AS A FREE MEMBER OF SOCIETY- PETER JUST SEEMS PROBLEMATIC COMMITTEE POLICY WAS PUBLIC POLICY WAS. A JUST- I DO HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO IT IS HAS THE RIGHT THIS RATE. FOR THEIR WORK- IN AN EIGHT HUNDRED TEN WE'RE TALKING A VERY SPECIFIC CLASS OF A JOB TRAINING HERE. BUT HAS HAS THE RATE BEEN. EVALUATED RECENTLY. WHEN WAS IT ESTABLISHED AND HOW OFTEN IS IT REVISITED THREE TO PAY HIM TALKING ABOUT. IT HASN'T BEEN REEVALUATED RECENTLY THAT I'M AWARE OF- WE CAN CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- BUT THE RATES HAVE BEEN GENERALLY THE SAME FOR SOMETIME. YEAH A IT I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEN CDC ARE REEVALUATED BUT IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MOST OF THE MORNING HERE IN TERMS OF PREPARATION FOR RELEASE- IN ON THE- WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF PROGRAMS OUTSIDE CAL SAVORING AND- EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE PENSIONS FOR ONE CASE IT SAID- THAT. ONE LOVE ONE ANOTHER ASSIST WORKERS WITH THE CENTURY PUTTING MONEY ASIDE- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- IN COMBINATION WITH THE VALUE EIGHTEEN THIS- THIS RATE PER HOUR. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A SYSTEM THAT SETS UP A TRUST. A SAVINGS TRUST FOR THOSE INMATES SO THAT IF THE GOAL IS THAT THEY BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED WHEN THEY GET OUT. CAN I GET GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOWN WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN TERMS OF THE NEED TO PROVIDE HOUSING. AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT I THINK MOST OF US KNOWING MOST OF US HAVE COME FROM COUNTIES WITH RE ENTRY CENTERS KNOW THAT ON THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE LOCALLY. UPON RELEASE IS THAT- THE WELL INTO MA HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CASH HAND- TO GET STABILIZED IN A PLACE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES OR SILICON VALLEY- SO. HE'LL CLEARLY SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO HOW YOU CONSTRUCTIVE. WORK CONSTRUCTED TRUST A REAL TRUST THAT WOULD BE PASSED OVER TO COUNTY OFFICIALS TO HELP HI YOU KNOW DISTRIBUTE STIPENDS OUT OF A TOTAL THOSE SAVINGS AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND. THIS IS ELISE IN THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THIS IS A SMALL WORLD THREE SMALL NUMBER OF FOLKS BUT- MAYBE A GREAT. OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ORE- SO. WHATEVER IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT DISCUSSION OR YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS SO AFTER TODAY ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF ANYTHING FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP SET YOU KNOW SAID THAT KIND OF DIRECTION OF. THANK YOU MANAGER GREAT THANK YOU SEND A COURTESY I THINK THESE ARE ALL- REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS WE INVEST AS A STATE WE INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO PROGRAMS. POST RELEASE ACROSS THE STATE- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COORDINATION OF PRE RELEASE SERVICES AND POST RELEASE SERVICES BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE FOR ANYONE LEAVING PRISON IS WHAT'S MY FUTURE. FOUR HOW DO I GET TO A BETTER PLACE AND OF A CRITICAL PART OF THAT OF COURSE IS A JOB IN A CAREER SO- WE'RE SORT OF IF WE DON'T INVEST ON THAT END OF IT THEN WE'RE MISSING THE BOAT AND ONLY INVESTING ON THE SERVICES SIDE OF IT SO- I'D- REALLY APPRECIATE- MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. AND RICHARD WILL BE COMING BACK TO THIS I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO- PARTICIPATED- TODAY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK THAT YOU DO THE SERVICE THAT YOU PERFORM FOR CALIFORNIA AND- AND HELP US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- ALL OF THESE POLICIES IN THE FORM OF A BUDGET.
