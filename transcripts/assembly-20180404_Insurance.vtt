IT.

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:33.744 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICIAL IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:36.347 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER.

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:38.182 region:rollup2
IS SEPARATE THE REQUIREMENT OF.

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:39.717 region:rollup2
ARTICLE TWENTY SECTION THREE OF

00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:40.785 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:41.652 region:rollup2
THAT THEY TAKE THE STANDARD OATH

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:43.454 region:rollup2

AS LEGISLATORS.

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:48.592 region:rollup2
SO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION

00:48:46.724 --> 00:48:50.594 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COVER ALL

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:52.329 region:rollup2
WORKERS PROVIDE A REMEDY.

HAVE UNDERTAKEN THIS AND.

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:57.501 region:rollup2
.

00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:59.503 region:rollup2
A FIDELITY TO AN OBLIGATION.

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:00.871 region:rollup2
A NOT EVERY WORKER HAS TAKEN AN

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:02.373 region:rollup2
OATH OF FIDELITY TO AN

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION.

00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:06.377 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICERS I BELIEVE IN

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DO TAKE THAT OATH.

00:49:06.377 --> 00:49:11.315 region:rollup2

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.330 region:rollup2
RELY UPON THEM TO ADHERE TO

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:28.332 region:rollup2

WITH GREAT FIDELITY.

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:31.402 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:38.042 region:rollup2
THE IDEA.

THAT'S A.

00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:44.415 region:rollup2
PURITY GUARD AT THE IN PARKLAND

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:45.883 region:rollup2
DID NOT RUSH INTO THE FRAY.

00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:47.551 region:rollup2
WHETHER RECESSION WHATEVER THE

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:49.720 region:rollup2
PURPOSE ACTUALLY BECAME A SOURCE

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:50.588 region:rollup2
OF CONTROVERSY.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.790 region:rollup2

IN LAS VEGAS.

00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:03.100 region:rollup2
