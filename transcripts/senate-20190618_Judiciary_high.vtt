00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:35.981

00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:01.306
TOPIC KNOWN AS SUDDEN

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:03.441

A COMPLETE MYSTERY AS TO WHAT

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:23.195
WENT ON THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:25.931

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.037
APPROPRIATE TIME WE WILL HAVE A

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:09.273
MOTION -- OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.674
HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE TO LOOK

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.943
AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS --

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:16.814
THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I I LIKE

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:18.582
MANY OF YOU RESPECT H. AWAY HIS

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:21.051
RIGHTS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.854
CERTAIN CONTROLS WITHIN THEIR

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.922
ASSOCIATIONS.

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.657
BUT THIS BILL I THINK MEECH SO

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:29.160
THAT DAD BALANCE NICELY BECAUSE

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:31.428
IT DOESN'T IMPOSE ANY RULES ON A

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:32.663
CHOICE THAT ARE ALREADY IN

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.964
EXISTENCE.

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.599
AND IT STILL ALLOWS H. R. WAYS

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.735
TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.237
THEIR COMMUNITY IT JUST THAT THE

00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:42.339
DOES ALLOW THEM TO PROHIBIT H.

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.575
AWAY SIN -- I THINK THAT'S OF

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:46.877
THE VERY ELEGANT THE SOLUTION

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:47.711
AND APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THAT

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:51.182
SO -- IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.082
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:52.383

00:40:57.421 --> 00:41:00.925
FORWARD AND PLEASE INDULGE MY MY

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:04.361
ANXIETIES I KNOW -- WE DO HAVE A

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:07.898
CRISIS ON OUR HANDS -- JUST WALK

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.600
CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH BRIEFLY

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:12.937
IN TERMS OF THE LIKE WHAT WHAT

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.705
AN EFFECTIVE PROHIBITION WOULD

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.774
BE VERSES SOME REASONABLE

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.108
RESTRICTIONS I KNOW I I RESERVE

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.710
THE THIS ISSUE IN THE HIGH FIRE

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:20.644
SEVERITY ZONES.

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.514
IF THEY'RE SORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY --

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.716
LEGITIMATE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:27.184
INTERESTS ABOUT.

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.854
HOW MANY CARS YOU CAN GET OFF OF

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.889
ONE CANYON ROAD AT A TIME?

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:33.991
OR SOME OTHER SORT OF WHAT THE

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.459
VIN OUNCES BECAUSE A REASONABLE

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.428
RESTRICTION HOW DOES HOW DOES

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.830
THAT LINE LOOK TO YOU WILL THERE

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.332
BE SOME DISCRETION WITH THE H.

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:44.235
O. WAYS TO SORT OF PURSUE THAT.

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.569
THAT KIND OF RESTRICTION IS THAT

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:46.570
HOW YOU ANTICIPATE IS BEING

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.738
IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT IT'S

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:49.273
WRITTEN I USUALLY I'M NOT SURE

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.242
THAT H. ALWAYS THEMSELVES ARE

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.077
THE ONES THAT ARE -- MAKING

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.144
DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH AND

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.813
SAFETY THEY TEND TO REGULATE

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.413
THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKE A

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.481
STATICS.

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:58.616
SO WOULD TYPICALLY BE MORE OF

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.050
YOUR MUNICIPALITY OR YOUR FIRE

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.185
MARSHAL THAT MIGHT LOOK AT

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:02.653
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I WOULD

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.321
ASSUME THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT.

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:05.356
THEY CAN STOP DEVELOPMENT IN

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:07.524
GENERAL BASED ON CERTAIN TYPES

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:10.427
OF A SEVERITY OF OF A PUBLIC

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.896
SAFETY THREATS WHETHER IT'S A

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:13.831
THREAT OF A LOT OF A MUD SLIDE

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:14.798
OR SOME OTHER THREAT THEY MIGHT

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:15.766
JUST SAY LISTEN WE'RE JUST NOT

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:16.967
GOING TO ALLOW MORE DEVELOPMENT

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.002
IN A CERTAIN AREA.

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.036
BUT THAT'S NOT AN H. ALWAYS

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.304
PLEASED TO MAKE THAT KIND OF

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:21.338
DETERMINATION H. ALWAYS ARE

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.806
TYPICALLY REGULATING.

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:23.874
YOU KNOW OF DESIGN THE

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.609
REGULATING CERTAIN SETBACKS AND

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.044
USUALLY WITH AN EYE TOWARD SORT

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.212
OF A STATIC SO MAINTAINING

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.880
PROPERTY VALUES.

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.916
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SO

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:34.018
IN THEORY IF THE IF THE HI FIRE

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:37.254
SEVERITY ZONE CITY OR COUNTY.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.889
IMPOSE SOME LOCAL ORDINANCE LIKE

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.190
THAT SOME RESTRICTION ON

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:42.092
DEVELOPMENT IN THE WE WE ARE IN

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:43.294
THE HIGH FIRES VERY SOUNDS WHICH

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.495
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:45.996
THE CHAIR AS WELL.

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.197
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY.

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.966
THAT WOULD TRUMP THAT I WOULD

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.134
OKAY SO THE AGE WE WOULDN'T BE

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.869
ABLE TO SAY NO TO THAT AND IT'S

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:52.970
IN YOUR SAYING IT'S NOT EVEN

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:54.405
REALLY IN THEIR PURVIEW I DON'T

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.673
THINK IT'S WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.774
EVER TO TRUMP SOMETHING LIKE

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.208
THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE NOT A

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.544
CITY -- THEY HAVE CERTAIN TYPES

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:01.912
OF DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL I

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.148
DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE JOYS OF

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.282
YOU CAN.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.650
YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:07.151
ONE THAT COULD APPROVED

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:08.152
DEVELOPMENT -- I THINK THAT WE

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:09.653
STILL HAVE TO HAVE AN UNDERLYING

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.855
PLAN FROM THE MUNICIPALITY -- IT

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.924
IS IS MY YOU KNOW GAS SO WE

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.359
DON'T TRUMP ANY STATE LAW THAT

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.694
THAT REGULATES.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.495
THE PROHIBITION OF BUILDING

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.931
BECAUSE OF SAFETY THIS DOESN'T

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:21.799
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:22.599
THIS IS JUST SAYING H. AWAYIS

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.901
BASED ON SORT OF THEIR OWN

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.169

METRICS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.039
ALLOWABLE THEY THEY CAN DO A LOT

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:35.946
pTO IT TO EIGHTY IS BASED ON

NOTICING REQUIREMENTS FOR RENT

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:47.918

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:49.119
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE

UNIVERSE PEOPLE CAN STILL HAVE

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:52.189
THEIR RENTS RAIDS BUT WHAT IT

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:53.457
DOES IS IT SAYS IT USE THE

WHICH WILL GIVE RENTERS MORE

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:04.368
TIME TO FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:06.503
TO PREPARE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW WE

MONTHS ONLY HAVE ONE MONTH

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:16.180
BEFORE THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT SO

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:17.381
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT INCLUDED

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.116
WOULD PROPOSE RENT INCREASES

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:21.585
ABOVE 10% UP 215% WOULD GET A

GIVE THEM MORE OPTIONS A LITTLE

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.135
BIT MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:12.536
WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO STAY

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.737
IN THE PLACE THAT THEY'RE IN --

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.172
WE THINK THAT THIS IS A A VERY

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.674
SMART THING FOR US TO DO AND SO

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:18.275
WE'RE SPONSORING THE BILL AND

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:18.675
ASK FOR LIVE UP.

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.277
VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.860
OPPOSITION.

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.695
ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE WILL BRING

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:44.268
IT TO THE DIET SENATOR BORCHERS.

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:47.371
JUST ONE UNDERSTAND.

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:52.409
THE SEQUENCE OF TIME SO IF IT IS.

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:56.213
IF IT'S 10% OR LESS.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.148
THEN IT'S THIRTY DAYS.

00:46:58.215 --> 00:46:59.349
I BELIEVE SO IT'S WHATEVER THE

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.951
CURRENT THE OTHER CURRENT LAW

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.019
THAN THIRTY THAT'S THE COULD THE

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:04.188
THAT THAT'S THE CURRENT LAW --

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:06.023
YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT.

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:08.058
IF IT'S GREATER THAN 10% LESS

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:11.562
THAN -- FIFTEEN KNOWS REQUIRED

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.063
NO LATER THAN NINETY DAYS THE

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.664
ACT.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.633
OF ITS 10% BETWEEN TEN AND

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.936
FIFTEEN BECAUSE THE NINETY RIGHT.

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.704
SHE SAID DO YOU CHANGE THE

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.806
NATIONAL THIRTY DAY PERIOD.

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.107
NOW SO IF THEY'RE ONLY RAISING

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:26.710
IT LET'S SAY 7% IT'S STILL THE

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:27.811
THIRTY DAYS THEY GET THEY ARE.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.546
THIRTY THIRTY DAY NOTICE MINIMUM

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:30.147
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A RENT

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:33.784
INCREASE SO COULD SOMEONE DO.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.320
NINE AND IN HAVE ITALY TRIGGERED

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:39.690
THE SIX OR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD --

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:40.290
BECAUSE IT'S CALCULATED ON A

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:43.594
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE BASIS

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.161
BASED IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:46.363
MONTHS.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.198
THEY GET BECAUSE YOU YOU ADD OR

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.667
YOU CAN'T SURE CUT IT NOW OKAY --

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.402
AND IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.137
THAT'LL BE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS.

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.172
IS THERE.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.642
A MATHEMATICAL -- UNCENSORED

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.777
ECONOMIC RATIONALE WHY NINETY IS

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:03.614
INSUFFICIENT ONE TWENTY IS.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.982
JUST THAT IF YOU'RE INCREASING

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.550
SOMEONE'S RENT A 100% THEY'RE

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:07.851
GOING TO NEED MORE TIME

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.553
SOMETIMES TO FIND THEY THEY

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.087
MIGHT.

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:11.088
THERE'S LESS CHANCE THAT THEY'LL

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:13.357
BE ABLE TO PAY THE 100% INCREASE

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.891
SO THERE'S MORE CHANCE OF THEM

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.827
HAVING TO MOVE YOUR BE 15% OR

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:18.895
MORE.

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:21.531
ABOVE FIFTY WITH YOU THAT'S A

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:22.199
HUNDRED I MEAN THAT THAT I AGREE

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.467
I TOTALLY GET THAT BY INTUITION

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:26.336
BUT I MEAN IF IT'S A 15%.

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:27.904
FIFTEEN OR MORE PERCENT JUMP

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.440
WITH A LOOP THROUGH THE CHAIR

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:31.441
SIR THROUGH THE CHAIR.

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.342
SEC YEAH JUST THAT WE THINK THAT

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:32.976
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS HANCE AT

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:34.244
THAT POINT THAT THE RENTERS

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:36.046
GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE

00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:37.814
SAME ACCOMMODATIONS WE WANTED TO

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:38.915
GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT THAT

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:39.583
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:40.484
MOVE.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.185
AND GIVE THEM AS MUCH TIME AS WE

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.520
THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE WITHOUT

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.055
BEING PUNITIVE TO THE PROPERTY

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:45.989
OWNER.

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.057
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:47.824
TO MOVE OUT AND SO WE WANT TO

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.393
GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO FIND

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.128
ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE -- YOU

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.996
KNOW IN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.231
IT'S SO HARD TO FIND

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:54.531
[inaudible]

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.666
YOU KNOW.

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:56.566
REASONABLE I WOULD SAY

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.302
REASONABLE BUT FIND RENTS AT

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.569
THAT SAME PACE SO WE HAVE WE

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:00.737
HAVE COMPLAINTS DOZENS OF

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:02.472
COMPLAINTS EVERY WEEK.

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.174
MY RENT WAS YOU KNOW INCREASE TO

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.976
WHERE I CAN'T PAY IT I'M CAN

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.110
GIVEN THIRTY DAYS TO MOVE OUT

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.478
AND THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME THAT

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.213
CYCLE THROUGH ON CRAIG'S LIST

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.348
YOU KNOW KIND OF EVERY THIRTY

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.349
DAYS YOU START SEEING THE NEW

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:12.783
LISTINGS.

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.351
THEY JUST NEEDED THEY NEEDED

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.052
MORE TIME TO FIND A PLACE TO

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.788
LIVE SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO MOVE

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:18.855
OUT OF THE THE AREA COMPLETELY

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.156
[inaudible]

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:20.924
YOUR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.259
COMMENTS.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:26.063
SENATOR TO RAZA -- I THANK THE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:30.233
AUTHOR VERY MUCH -- WE'RE NOT

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.568
TALKING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.337
ARE ON THE EDGE.

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:34.638
A BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.707
WE RARELY TALK ABOUT THEM.

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:38.008
AND THAT'S REALLY KIND OF WHAT

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:39.843
THIS IS ABOUT.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.712
IS THAT WATCHING OUT FOR THOSE

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:44.047
PEOPLE I KNOW IN LA COUNTY ALONE.

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.550
THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.017
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS.

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:50.187
OF SEVERELY OVER BURDENED.

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:52.756
HOUSEHOLDS THAT CAN PAY THE RENT

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.157
FOR THEIR PAIN ARE THE I THINK

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:57.027
THAT'S 50% OF THEIR INCOME.

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:59.396
SEOUL MORE AND MORE AND MORE

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.897
FAMILIES ARE ON THE BRINK OF

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.834
THAT AND I GUESS THIS IS THE

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.403
VERY LEAST THAT WE CAN DO WHICH

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.238
IS ALLOW THEM TIME TO FIND.

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:10.073
MAYBE THE RIGHT STREET THAT

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.908
THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP THE TENT.

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:15.612
OR YOU KNOW LIVE IN SOMEBODY'S

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.347
LIVING ROOM OR SLEEP ON THE

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:19.649
COUCH OR SOMETHING.

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:21.918
SO -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:23.987
DOING AND I HOPE THIS LEADS TO

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:26.923
OTHER -- MEASURES THAT ARE FAR

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.792
MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.527
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THE

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.429
ON THE EDGE.

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.196
YEAH AND SOMETIMES FOR PEOPLE

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.365
GIVING THEM TIME TO NAVIGATE

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:35.999
OTHER RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:36.933
OUT THERE.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.301
WHETHER IT'S SHELTERS ARE OTHER

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.103
AID OR PORTABLE HOUSING THIS

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:41.271
GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:42.906
AND HOPEFULLY THAT EXTRA MONTH

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.274
COULD YOU KNOW IT POTENTIALLY

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:45.642
COULD KEEP SOMEONE FROM.

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:46.910
ENDING UP ON THE STREET YOU KNOW

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.378
BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE THEM A

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.946
COUPLE MONTHS TO FIND THEIR WAY.

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.148
YOU KNOW INTO SOME ALTERNATIVE

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:53.283
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.551
SAYING THAT.

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.586
THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.155

100% RENT INCREASES AND YOU KNOW

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:12.769
THEY'RE WORKING.

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:15.572
THEY'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITIES ARE.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:18.809
IN PLACES LIKE LA WHERE TRAFFIC

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.977
BECOMES A FACTOR IN HOW YOU GET

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:23.246
TO WORK OR IN THE BAY AREA AND

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.815

I WISH.

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.019

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.254
TO SUCH HIGH RENT INCREASES BUT

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:34.391
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT LANDLORDS

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.026

BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK THE

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.389
CHAIRED.

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:41.791

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:52.068
NORMALLY I AM NOT WANT TO BE A

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.337
PROPONENT OF FURTHER REGULATION

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:57.206
ON THE CITIZENRY OF CALIFORNIA

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.774
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I TAKE.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:02:59.976
A VERY SERIOUSLY AND VERY

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.911
CAUTIOUSLY AND I DID THINK ABOUT

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.546
TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.548
OPPOSITION BUT I AS THE CHAIR

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.115
SAID THIS.

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.551
THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PROBABLY

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.452
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL THING

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.921
THAT MOST OF THESE PARTIES WILL

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.189
EVER SIGNED IN THEIR LIFETIME SO

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:15.324
GIVEN THAT FACT IT DOESN'T SEEM

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.959
LIKE SEVEN DAYS IS ON REASONABLE.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.494
ALSO IS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.962
EVEN THOUGH THE I THINK

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.730
ORIGINALLY WHEN THE LAW WAS

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.932
DRAFTED THE THOUGHT WAS THAT IF

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.000
YOU HAVE ONE PARTY THAT'S

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.067
REPRESENTED ONE THAT'S ON

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.602
REPRESENTED THERE'S A BIG POWER

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.503
IMBALANCE.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.971
THERE WHICH IS TRUE BUT IT IS

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:31.941
ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU HAVE.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.209
ONE THAT IS TRYING TO PROTECT

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.477
ASSETS IN ONE PARTY THE JUST

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.279
WANTS TO GET MARRIED EVEN IF THE

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:37.613
OTHER PARTY IS REPRESENTED

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.048
THERE'S STILL A POWER IMBALANCE

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.283
THERE BECAUSE ONE MIGHT HAVE THE

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.851
FAMILY LAW FIRM THAT'S BEEN IN

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.553
THEIR FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS.

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.220
AND THE OTHER HAVE SOMEONE THAT

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.922
THEY THEY LOOKED UP IN THE

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:46.856
YELLOW PAGES THAT MORNING RIGHT

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.424
SO -- THEY'RE STILL A

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.692
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.761
THERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.462
THAT PRESSURE ISN'T A EXERTING

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.531
UNDUE INFLUENCE AND ALSO LET ME

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:56.499
MAKE ONE POINT. TO SOMETHING

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.634
ELSE THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID

01:03:58.701 --> 01:03:59.268
THAT I DISAGREE WITH WHICH IS

01:03:59.335 --> 01:03:59.902
THAT.

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:04.907
WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF THIS CAUSED.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.809
A DELAY IN A WEDDING.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:07.343
A WRITER SO YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:08.644
NEGOTIATING WE HAVE TO DO AN

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.412
AMENDMENT AND ON A WE'VE GOT TO

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.179
PUSH BACK THE WEDDING DATE BUT

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.014
WE ALL KNOW THAT LEGALLY.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:15.918
THE THE MARRIAGE ISN'T ISN'T --

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.120
OUR CONSUMMATED UNTIL THE OUR

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.755
MARRIAGE LICENSES SIDE HAS

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:20.489
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CEREMONY

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.058
SO THE IN THE WORST CASE

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:23.893
SCENARIO WHERE AN AMENDMENT HAD

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.794
TO BE DRAFTED AND SIGNED AT THE

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.628
LAST MINUTE.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.295
YOU COULD STILL HAVE THE

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:27.530
CEREMONY WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.931
THOSE SEVEN DAYS TO GET THE

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.166
MARRIAGE LICENSE SIDE AND AS YOU

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.934
POINT OUT YOUR ANALYSIS THAT

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.669
MIGHT BE ON A ROMANTIC BUT A

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.104
PRIMER AGREEMENTS ARE ROMANTIC

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.005
AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WORLD

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:36.806
WE LIVE IN SO.

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:39.108
THERE IS A A METHODOLOGY FOR

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.509
DEALING WITH EVEN THAT SITUATION

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.877
I APPRECIATE HERE MENTIONING

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:46.315

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:48.284

THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.705
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OUT OF

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.907
A AS AN AMENDMENT THAT ARE I

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.142
INSIST UPON BECAUSE THIS IS ONE

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.710
OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE NOT SURE

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:41.216
IF IT'S BROKEN -- IS IF THE

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.951
COUNTY IS IN ANY WAY INVOLVED IN

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.953

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.225
THEN THE WHATEVER SETTLEMENT IS

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.661
REACH WOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY AT

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:54.096
WHICH IS WHAT IS WHAT HAPPENS

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.030
NOW.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.665
THAT REALLY THE ONLY DISTINCTION

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.100
HERE AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.735
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:04.106
IF THIS IS OUR LITIGATION.

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.775
THAT IS COMMANDS AND EXECUTED

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.743
EXCLUSIVELY.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.146
BY THE CITY ATTORNEY THEN THE

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.682
BAND THE THE FINANCIAL BENEFIT

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.952
WILL END IN NEAR TO THE TO THE

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.120
CITY ATTORNEY EXCLUSIVELY.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.188
BOB RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS IF

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.423
THE COUNTY.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.924

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:26.194
GET 50% OF WHATEVER THE JUDGMENT

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.596
OR SETTLEMENT IS.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.397
THIS WILL SIMPLY.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.600
A PROVIDE THAT -- THAT.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.936
IF THERE IS NO WORK SHARING THEN

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:35.504
THERE.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.805
DOESN'T GO THERE WON'T BE IN

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:40.976
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANY KIND OF

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.644
SETTLEMENT SHARING SO YOU YOU'RE

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:43.945
EAGER TO RESPONSE TO TELL ME OF

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:44.746
MY WRONG ON THIS.

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.314
YOU'RE NOT WRONG I THINK THERE'S

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:46.948
A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.750
MISUNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE LOOK

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.852
ATIT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR WHOEVER

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.354
PUTS THE WORK IN AS SHOULD

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.788
SHOULD RECOVER THE BENEFIT BUT

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.824
THE THE PROBLEM IS THE CONSUMERS.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.192
WHO ARE THE CONSUMERS BETTER

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.460
IMPACTED?

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.795
IN THE WELLS FARGO CASE IT

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.831
WASN'T A MATTER OF WELLS FARGO

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:05.400
OPENING FAKE ACCOUNTS ONLY IN

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:06.701
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:10.105
THE ENTIRE COUNTY -- CONSUMERS

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.706
WERE ALL IMPACTED BY THOUGHT.

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:14.342
WE WERE WE RECEIVE 50% OF THAT

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:15.977
RECOVERY FROM THE CITY OF LOS

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.512
ANGELES WHICH WE ARE EXTREMELY

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:20.048
GRATEFUL FOR AND WE STARTED OUR

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.283
AFFIRMATIVE LIVE LITIGATION

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.717
DIVISION SO THAT WE CAN HELP

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:23.618
MORE.

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.887
COUNTY WIDE CONSUMERSTHE CASES

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.422
THAT ARE BROUGHT ARE GENERALLY

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.658
NOT JUST WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.059
ANGELES.

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.527
EVERYBODY'S IMPACTED AND SO

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:34.729
THAT'S WHY THE WAY THE LAW IS

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.098
RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.600
BECAUSE HALF OF THE MONEY WILL

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:41.503
GO TO THE CITY WHO HAS ABOUT 40%

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:42.437
IN LOS ANGELES OF THE

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.505
CONSTITUENTS.

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.307
AND THE REMAINDER WILL COME TO

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:46.608
THE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.476

AND JOE MAY BE ABLE TO TALK MORE

01:20:55.684 --> 01:21:01.656
ABOUT -- HOW HIS RELATIONSHIP

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.225

OPPONENTS THIS BILL TODAY IN

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:18.039
NONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS THAT

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:18.540
THE SENATE RETURNEES ARE

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.107
INVOLVED.

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.875
RECEIVE ANY OF THOSE AWARDS SO

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.677

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:07.289
PRE SHOPPERS.

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.390

PERSISTING IN OUR DOING SOMEHOW

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.206
THE CITY ATTORNEY'S SHOULD HAVE

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.459
BROADER THAN JUST THE CITY IN

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.261
SOME OF THESE INSTANCES.

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:49.130
THAT THE COUNTY COUNCIL SHOULD

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.899
GET A BENEFIT.

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:51.966

WITH THAT WHY.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.348
AT THE END THE CITY DIDN'T GET

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:42.250
ANY AYE I DON'T THINK THE CITY'S

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:42.817
COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IT'S

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.685

THE AGENCY THAT DID THE WORK.

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.831
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT IF

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:59.768
THE CITY DOES ALL THE WORK 50%

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:01.603
OF IT BY VIRTUE OF THE CURRENT

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:03.605

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:15.063
IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:17.398
COUNTIES ARE INTERESTED THEN --

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:19.233
I WOULD THINK SUPPORTING THE

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.035
CITIES.

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:23.204
THINK THE THING THAT THE THE

THE THE AGENCIES CONTINUE TO

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.580
WORK TOGETHER.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.449
OF BECAUSE IF THEY DO THEN BOTH

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.784
WILL BENEFIT SO I'VE TALKED TO

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:38.486
THE AUTHOR THE BILL AND COMPLEX

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:40.021
PRESS MY CONCERNED.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:42.156
DAD IF IF I GET TO KEEP IT ALL

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.725
THEN I'M NOT GONNA SURE BECAUSE

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.693
I HAVE THE CHANCE TO KEEP IT ALL.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.062
AND I WAS ASSURED THAT THAT IS

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:49.631
NOT.

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.232
AT LEAST IT HAS NOT BEEN THE

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:52.066
CASE.

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:53.267
AND I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:56.504
CONTINUE NOT BEING THE CASE BUT

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.538
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WERE YOU

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.374
WE CAN SOMETIMES BE TALKING

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.141
ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:00.908
MONEY.

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.310
THAT ONE PARTY COULD WANT TO

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:04.612
KEEP IT RATHER THAN TO SHARE IT

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:06.514
SO I WONDER COULD THE CITY

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:09.984
ATTORNEY OF LA JUST GIVE US.

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.304
BUT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO SHARE

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:46.274
WITH YOU OKAY THAT'S YEAH.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.178
OKAY -- SEE CENTER GONZALEZ.

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.712
YES NOW I THINK THE AUTHORS WELL

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:54.348
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.184
WOULD ALSO AGREED -- I THINK WE

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.285
DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT A

01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:01.255
CONSUMER THIS BILL AND I DON'T

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:02.690
KNOW THAT.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.192
BUT I REVIEW THE BILL -- IT

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:05.059
DIDN'T SEEM THE ANYTHING

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.761
PRECLUDED THE COUNTY FROM

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:08.462
CONTINUING THIS GREAT WORK WHICH

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.264
MOST OF IT THAT I HAVE HERE IS

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.200
EXIDE PARAMOUNT WHICH SHOULD BE

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:13.768
AND IN MY DISTRICT -- WHICH ARE

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:17.038
VERY -- IMPORTANT -- PROJECTS

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.440
BUT AGAIN I HOPE THAT THIS WORK

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.708
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY THAT

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:22.009
IT WOULDN'T PRECLUDE THE COUNTY

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.644
FROM CONTINUING THE WORK AND AND

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.313
WORKING WITH THAT THE CITY OF

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:26.447
LOS ANGELES -- IN SOME REGARD

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.182
BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT SMALLER

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.650
CITIES VERSUS LARGER CITIES

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.519
HAVING A DISTRICT THAT HAS ABOUT

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:33.521
TWELVE CITIES -- THE SMALLER

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.056
CITIES ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.657
THESE FUNDS DIRECTLY PARAMOUNT

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:37.959
AND VERNON WILL NOT SEE THOSE

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.695
DOLLARS DIRECTLY -- BENEFITING

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.096
THEIR CONSTITUENCIES SO THAT'S

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.798
WHERE I HAVE AN ISSUE.

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:45.299
WITH THIS AS WELL I THINK WE'LL

01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:48.769
LET'S CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AIR

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:51.138
QUALITY MANAGEMENT -- I HAVE SO

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:51.772
MANY REGIONAL BOARDS AS GAG I

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:52.773
MEAN SO MANY THAT WE CAN

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.541
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND I KNOW

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.476
THE COUNTY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:57.578
WITH TO BRING THESE ISSUES.

01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:58.179
TO RUSSIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.814
AGAIN.

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:04.952
THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.755
I HAVE A HEADACHE ON THIS ISSUE --

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.557
IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY AS A

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:10.925
CITY COUNCILMAN IN MY PREVIOUS

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:12.994
CAPACITY THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.528
LIKE LITERALLY I'M HEARING BOTH

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:15.897
SIDES YELLING BACK AND FORTH

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:16.864
INSIDE MY HEAD.

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:18.766
ON THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:20.134
WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST PATH

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:23.704
FORWARD -- WHEN YOU WERE MOVING

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:26.140
WE WHEN YOU WERE --

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.174
CONTEMPLATING MOVING THIS

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.976
LEGISLATION.

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.678
DO YOU EVER CROSS YOUR MIND THAT

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:33.648
MAY BE. ONE OTHER OPTION MIGHT

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:37.018
BE TO DRAW THIS INTO THE REALM

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.819
OF THE REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT.

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:39.921
BETWEEN A MUNICIPALITY IN THE

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.923
COUNTY.

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.759
BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE -- IN

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:46.794
THOSE EARLIER CAPACITIES.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.296
EVERY YEAR EVERY TWO YEARS WE

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:50.598
HAD A REVENUE TAX REVENUE

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:52.934
SHARING AGREEMENT.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.502
ADEN AND OBVIOUSLY MOST YOU KNOW

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.704
WITH THE WITH PROPERTY TAXES

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:58.239
SOMEONE SO FORTH BUT IT NGUYEN

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.441
INTO THE FORM OF CONTRACT VIA

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.109
NEGOTIATION.

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:03.911
AND I THINK THE EQUITIES FLOATED

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:05.913
TO THE TOP IN THE REASON WHY THE

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.882
EQUITIES FLOATED THE TOP IS THE

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:08.983
COUNTY IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.818
THEN THE CITY.

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.787
THE COUNTY PROVIDE SERVICES AT A

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:16.357
LEVEL THE CITIES DO NOT -- FOR

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.992
EXAMPLE MMHM MY UNDERSTANDING

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:18.893
MOST CITIES OR A LOT OF CITIES

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.329
DON'T PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:21.529
RIGHT.

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.931
THE COUNTY DOES.

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:25.299
BOB CITIES DO NOT HAVE DISTRICT

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:27.435
ATTORNEYS -- ACROSS A BROAD

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:31.305
RANGE OF ISSUES ARE -- THE

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:32.873
CITY'S DON'T SO.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.142
WE'RE LOOKING FOR PARITY.

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.777
AND IT'S SEDUCTIVE TO LOOK UPON

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:40.748
THIS AS IF YOU DO THE WORK YOU

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:41.515
SHOULD REAP THE REWARDS.

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:43.918
BUT THAT IS NOT THE REALITY IN

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:46.854
THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF OUR

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:49.890
CITY MUNICIPALITY COUNTY.

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.159
OUR RELATIONSHIP IT'S NOT AS

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.427
SIMPLE AS THAT SO THAT'S WHY I'M

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.428
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I THINK THE

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:57.431
IDEA IS GOOD BUT DID YOU EVER.

01:33:57.498 --> 01:33:59.533
IN SOME POSE MY QUESTION --

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.101
THROUGH THE CHAIR OF SHE SO

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.136
WISHES TO YOU DID YOU EVER

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.838
CONSIDER THERE MIGHT BE

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:05.973
ALTERNATIVE -- IN MAKE IT IN THE

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.341
FORM OF AN OF COUNTIES

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:09.510
NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR CITIES OR

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:11.912
VICE VERSA [inaudible]

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.681
LET.

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:14.582
LET ME JUST.

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:15.883
BEFORE FROM JUMP I WOULD SAY

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:16.917
THAT YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCES ON

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:17.718
THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD NOT BE

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:22.256
APPLICABLE IN THIS SITUATION

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:22.890
BECAUSE THE SIZE FIFTY YOU'RE.

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:23.290
ABOUT.

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.760
IS THE SAME CONCEPT IT IS

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:26.394
SIMILAR CONCEPTS BUT HE AYE AYE

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.395
AND STILL I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:28.229
APPLES TO APPLES WHEN YOU'RE

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:29.030
TALKING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:29.663
THREE EXTREMELY LARGE CITIES.

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.432
I WOULD TELL YOU THE CURRENT

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.466
STATE OF AFFAIRS IS REVENUE

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:33.834
SHARING IF YOU THE COUNTY RIGHT

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:36.037
IT IS NOT A HAPPY SHARE YOU

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:37.038
SHARE THE CITY WOULD SHARE THE

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:37.538
REVENUE WITH THE COUNTY

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:38.472
CURRENTLY THIS PROBLEM THAT WE

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:41.976
HAVE IS THAT IS NOT RECIPROCATED --

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:43.411
WITH THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS YOU

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.945
KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:45.513
YOUR REVENUE SHARING BUT THE

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.681
CITY THE COUNTY WOULD DO IT IF

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.016
THERE IS A SHARED EFFORT --

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.718
THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS WERE

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:51.986
NEGOTIATIONS ARE DONE TO DO

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:52.987
REVENUE SHARING THAT'S THE STATE

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:55.256
OF PLAY TODAY THE PROBLEM SIMPLY

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:56.490
IS WHEN THE COUNTIES BEING THE

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:58.192
ACTIONS THE CITY SHARES AND NONE

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.727
OF THAT -- IF THE COUNT OF THE

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:01.695
CITY DOES ALL THE WORK THE

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:04.031
COUNTY ALWAYS SHARE AND HALF OF

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:04.932
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND RICK

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.167
GERMAN YOU YOU YOU RE YOU

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.202
PROPERLY RESTATED THE THE RUB.

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:09.003
BY BUT MY QUESTION IS

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:11.038
OUTSTANDING STILL IS WAS THAT

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:13.974
EVER CONTEMPLATED AS A WAY OF

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:16.510
GETTING YOU GUYS THROUGH THIS OR

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:18.512
POPULATION CENTERS OVER.

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:19.313
SEVEN FIFTY GETTING YOU THROUGH

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.949
THIS BECAUSE OF THIS IS NOT

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:24.051
INSIGNIFICANT -- DEVELOPMENT IN

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.753
THE SEPARATION.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:35.629
OF COUNTY MUNICIPALITY RELATIONS.

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:36.630
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:38.566
NEGOTIATION IS IS A WAY FORWARD

01:35:38.632 --> 01:35:40.301
BY AMENDING THE LEGISLATION THAT

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:41.469
WOULD ALLOW.

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:44.138
FOR SOME NEGOTIATED OUTCOME.

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:44.905
IT IS TO SYNC ANSWERS NO SENATOR

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:46.307
BUT YOU ALREADY HEARD THE ANSWER

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.041
IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THE

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:47.875
COUNTY WOULD NOT SHARE THE

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:49.009
PROCEEDS WITH THE CITIES THIS IS

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:49.643
NOT WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:50.578
DOING.

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:52.413
THIS BILL CREATES.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.215
A ENDS THE UNFAIRNESS AND

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:56.951
CREATES EQUITY WHEN THEY'RE

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:58.886
SHARED -- EFFORT MADE.

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.489
OKAY -- HOLD ON THERE'S ANOTHER.

THANK YOU.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.537
SO I THINK THE CONCERN IS IF I

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.839
MAY.

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:19.673
A KNOWING IN DISCUSSING THIS

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.609

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:24.245
SENATOR DORADO AND ENTER HER

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:25.913
QUESTIONS AND ALL THEIR CONCERN

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.348
IS.

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:29.450
DAD IF THE COUNTY IF YOU WILL

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.751
WE'RE TO GO COLD TURKEY.

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:31.886
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:35.389
CONTINUE DOING THEIR WRK WHAT I

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:37.691
HEARD THE LA CITY ATTORNEY'S

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:39.059
OFFICE SAY AND I'VE DISCUSSES

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.928
WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY DIRECTLY

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.630
IT IS NOT HIS INTENT? TO

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:45.833
ESSENTIALLY CLOSE OUT AND KEEP

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.836
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:52.439
COUNTY OF LA OUT OF THESE.

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:55.976
EFFORTS -- ON THE OTHER HAND IF

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.578
THAT WERE TO TAKE PLACE THE

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.347
COUNTY WOULD LOSE ITS ABILITY TO

01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:02.116
FUNCTION UNLESS THE COUNTY WERE

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.418
MORE ARGUABLY MORE PROACTIVE IN

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.886
BROUGHT ITS OWN CASES.

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:08.088
MY HOPE IS THAT YOU WILL

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:11.225
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.359
THE EXTENT THAT BENEFITS THE

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:14.562
CONSUMERS.

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:17.831
OUR IN THIS AND SO -- IF THERE

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:21.235
IS A TIE I THINK WHAT WE WOULD

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:23.404
LIKE TO SEE IS.

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.539
IN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:26.473
THINK SENATOR RAZA WAS

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.209
ARTICULATED AS WELL AND AND

01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:29.176
ACTUALLY I THINK EVERYBODY HERE

TOGETHER WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:32.313
HERE.

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.448
TRYING TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:38.686
SO -- THE BILL IT CURRENTLY IS A

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.688

THAT NOW OR IF WE CONTINUE THIS

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.297
PERHAPS A WEEK AND GET SOME KIND

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:54.101
OF AGREEMENT THE EITHER THE TO

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:54.702

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:56.937
IMPLEMENTATION PERHAPS A YEAR SO

01:37:57.004 --> 01:38:03.677
THAT THE DA'S OFFICE CAN.

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.312
SORT OF TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.547
MECHANISMS BY WHICH IT MIGHT

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.148
WORK WITH YOU -- IN THE CITY

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:09.817
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DO SOME

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:11.752
WORK SHARING.

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:15.389
VERSES -- RESULTS SHARING.

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:18.692
OR ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WAS --

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.728
TO HAVE A A SORT OF A REVISIT ON

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.796
THIS IN A COUPLE YEARS TWO TO

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:23.731
THREE YEARS TO SEE HOW IT'S

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.633
GOING AS A TRUST A COUPLE

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:26.267
OPTIONS HI.

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.468
YOU KNOW I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:30.271
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS I WANT

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:31.705
TO TAKE EVERYBODY AT THEIR WORD

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.073
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THAT

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.842
WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:35.442
OF EVERYBODY.

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:37.711
BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.246
OUT THERE AND AS CENTER MONEY IF

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.282
YOU'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:42.850
THINK ON THAT POINT MADAM CHAIR

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:47.388
AND BE CURIOUS WHAT THE AUTHOR

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:48.489
THINKS AS WELL BUT I THINK THE

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:48.789
AMENDMENT.

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:49.323
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.990
AUTHOR.

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:51.925
PROVIDES THAT MECHANISM ALREADY

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.428
IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO GUARANTEE

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.797
ITS CONTINUED SHARE THEY NEED

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.399
ONLY PARTICIPATE.

01:38:58.465 --> 01:38:59.533
AT THE INVESTIGATIVE LEVEL OF

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.769
THE CASE.

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:03.070
THEY'RE GUARANTEED HALF IS I

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:05.005
READ THE CURRENT BILL SO THAT IS

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:07.341
CORRECT ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT.

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.810
THEY NEED ONLY PARTICIPATE WITH

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.278
THE CITY ATTORNEY.

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.280
IN THE INVESTIGATION OF A

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:15.349
PENDING CASE.

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:17.051
I GUESS THE ONLY QUESTION IS

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.852
WOULD THE CITY ATTORNEY WANT TO

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.587
KEEP DOING THAT WHEN AT THE END

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:21.955
OF THE DAY THEY COULD GET THE

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.757
FULL NINE YARDS OR THE FULL

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.326
AMOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENT.

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:27.027
VERSUS HAVING TO SHARE IT AND IN

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.462
TALKING WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:31.365
HE SAID HE IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:33.767
KEEP WORKING WITH THE WITH THE

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:36.537
COUNTY -- AND I THINK THAT'S IF

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.439
THAT'S THE CASE THEN I THINK

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.507
WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE.

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.209
BUT THEN PERHAPS.

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:45.145
THERE MIGHT BE A DISCARDED. TO

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.013
REVISIT THIS AT SOME POINT I

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.615
DON'T KNOW WHETHER AGAIN A SOME

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.751
KIND OF I HESITATE TO SAY SUNSET

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:53.020
BUT SOME KIND OF PERHAPS OF

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:54.288
REPORTING.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.756
SO THAT WE CAN SEE HOW THIS IS

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.790
ALL WORKING WOULD THAT BE

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.826
SOMETHING THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.594
BE WILLING TO DO. FOR YOU AND

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:01.895
THE COMMITTEE HAVE MY IRON CLAD

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:02.996
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.665
DISCUSS WITH ALL THE PARTIES

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.433
INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER TO MAKE

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.035
SURE THAT WE GET THE MOST

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:10.904
AGREEABLE OUTCOME FOR CONSUMERS --

01:40:10.971 --> 01:40:12.206

ACCEPTED IT AND I ASK MEMBERS OF

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:19.613
TOKEN OF FAITH.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.615
AGAIN THEY DO THE MINIMALIST

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.550
AMOUNT OF WORK AND THEY'RE GONNA

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.885
GET HALF OF THE AWARD A RIGHT

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.687
NOW THAT I THINK IS A SHOW OF MY

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.255
FAITH WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:29.456
GOOD IN THIS SPACE.

A WE CAN CONTINUE EXPLORE THE

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:31.692

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:40.667
HERE AND I'D WE NORMALLY DON'T

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:43.203
SPEAK TWICE BUT I I DO HAVE TO

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:47.908
MAKE A COMMENT -- BASE TO ONE

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.443
MADE EARLIER.

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.411
THERE IS A TENSION IN

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:51.145
INSTITUTIONAL TENSION THAT

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.179
EXISTS BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:54.014
AND COUNTIES.

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:56.350
THE IDEA OF PARTICIPATING AT THE

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:59.953
INVESTED INVESTIGATORY STAGES.

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.956
I THINK IT SOUNDS NICE I DON'T

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:05.125
THINK OUR THAT ONCE SOMETHING

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.293
LIKE THIS DEVELOPS.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.263
THAT THE THE TERRITORIAL ISM.

01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:10.931
WILL GO AWAY IN FACT IT WILL

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:12.366
INCREASE.

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:14.768
AND THAT THAT IS THAT IS MIKE MY

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.870
CONCERN MY CONCERN.

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:18.071
AND IT BUT I THINK THE CHEER I

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:19.506
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S AT RIGHT

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:20.874
NOW BUT I THINK.

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:23.444
IF THERE WERE A WAY OF PUTTING A

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:25.078
A SUNSET.

01:41:25.145 --> 01:41:27.514
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THIS TO

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:30.083
DEVELOP WITHOUT BEING BOUND BY

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:32.119
THE CONSEQUENCES AND HAVING TO

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:34.054
RE INITIATE I THINK THAT COULD

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.090
BE A GOOD WAY FOR AN ITEM WHICH

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:37.724
I I COMMEND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.193

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:04.151

SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH

01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:49.029
HIGH SCHOOL DUE TO ILLNESS SO

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:51.064
THAT'S WHY THE MEMORY OF THE

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:52.999
ENCOUNTER I HAD WITH DOCTOR

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:53.934
TYNDALL.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.335
IS SO VIVID.

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:57.170
IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:59.840
DURING MY JUNIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE.

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:01.007
I WENT TO THE S. C. HEALTH

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.409

EXPERIENCING DIARRHEA.

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:06.146
AND THE MOST EXCRUCIATING

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:09.049
STOMACH PAIN HAD EVER FELT.

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.884
IT WAS THERE THAT I CAME UNDER

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:12.719
THE CARE OF DOCTOR TYNDALL.

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:15.021
I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN.

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.056
I JUST WANTED TO GET TO THE

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:18.058
BOTTOM OF MY ILLNESS.

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.292
SO I COULD BE TREATED IN THE

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:22.629
PAIN WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:24.865
WHEN I WAS TOLD TO GET UNDRESSED?

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.099
AND TO PUT MY LEGS UP IN THE

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:26.700
STIRRUPS.

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:30.370
I COMPLIED.

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:32.772
THE EXPERIENCE IT WASN'T EASY BY

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:36.409
ANY MEANS -- IN ADDITION TO THE

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:38.278
ALMOST BLINDING STOMACH PAIN

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:42.215
THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING -- I WAS

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:43.383
PUT THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF A FULL

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:45.752
A VAGINAL EXAM.

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.888
THAT WAS MY FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.222
VISIT AND I WAS A VIRGIN AT THE

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:51.524
TIME.

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:54.794
AFTER HE WAS DONE WITH MY EXAM.

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.463
HE CAME UP.

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:58.098
AND SAID.

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.032

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:01.368
GO BACK TO YOUR DORM AND IT'LL

01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:05.505
PASS IN A COUPLE HOURS.

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:07.874
I WAS VERY CONFUSED WHY I HAD TO

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:09.609
GO THROUGH A FULL VAGINAL EXAM

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:10.944
JUST FOR SIMPLE FOOD POISONING.

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:13.446
DIAGNOSIS.

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:14.748
BUT YOU KNOW I TRUSTED THE

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:16.049
DOCTOR.

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:18.184
AND I DIDN'T QUESTION IS ACTIONS.

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:21.855
BUT NOTHING ABOUT THAT DAY THAT

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.223
WILL MY SPIRIT.

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:24.925
I'VE BEEN TO MILLIONS OF DOCTORS

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:27.861
APPOINTMENTS AND I'VE YOU KNOW.

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.629
I'VE I REMEMBER THIS ONE LIKE IT

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:31.731
WAS YESTERDAY.

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:32.766
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:36.670
READING ABOUT THE STORIES.

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:38.705
OF DOCTOR TEN THE LAST YEAR.

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:40.307
IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT.

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:42.142
MY CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.777
TO ME IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.745
BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR.

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:48.915
DR TYNDALL VIOLATED ME.

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:49.683
I WAS PUT THROUGH THE ORDEAL FOR

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:51.017
VAGINAL EXAM FOR SOMETHING

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:52.852
TOTALLY.

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.220
AND RELATED TO MY DISEASE HE

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:56.056
PRAYED ON MY YOUTH.

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:57.991
AND MY NAY OF IT TODAY.

01:49:58.058 --> 01:49:59.826
LIKE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED OF MY

01:49:59.893 --> 01:50:01.628
TROJAN SISTERS.

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:03.296
I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY

01:50:03.363 --> 01:50:04.831
SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:06.967
MY TRUSTED DOCTOR.

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:09.269
A DOCTOR THAT USC KEPT EMPLOYED

01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:11.671
AND ALLOWED TO TREAT YOUNG WOMEN

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:11.972
[inaudible]

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:14.541
LIKE ME.

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:15.976
LONG AFTER REPORTS OF ABUSE HAVE

01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:18.144
BEEN REPORTED.

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.913
MY MOTHER WAS ABUSED AS A CHILD

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.715
AND SHE ALWAYS IMPRESSED UPON ME

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:22.949
IF SOMEBODY EVER VIOLATED ME TO

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.584
SPEAK UP.

01:50:24.651 --> 01:50:25.552
I NOW HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:26.653
DAUGHTER AND I'M CONSTANTLY

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.455
TALKING WITH HER ABOUT HOW SHE

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:30.657
SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T BE TOUCH.

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:33.860
SO I JUST I HAD TO SPEAK UP.

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:35.028
AND COME FORWARD AND NOT JUST

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:38.164
FOR ME BUT FOR MY MOM AND FOR

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:42.202
THE HUNDREDS OF USC WOMEN WHO.

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:44.604
HAVE SAT IN THEIR SHAME FEAR AND

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:45.205
MISTRUST BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.173
THEY SUFFERED BY SOMEONE WHO IS

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.109
SUPPOSED TO CARE FOR THEM.

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:51.578
THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING.

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:53.046
WHEN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:55.048
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE FOR OVER

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:57.317
THIRTY YEARS?

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:58.718
THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN THOSE

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:01.354
GOOD NURSES WHO REPORTED THIS

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:03.957
HORRENDOUS CONTENT CONDUCT WERE

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:05.925
MET WITH INACTION OR EVEN WORSE

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:08.261
A COVER UP.

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:09.796
THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE IS

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.432
CONTINUING AND NOW AS WE TRY TO

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:14.234
BRING OUR CASE TO A COURT OF LAW.

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.835
THE ENTITY THAT ALLOWED THE

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.670
ABUSE UFC.

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:18.838
IS CLAIMING THAT ARE QUE

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.640
DEADLINES AND STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS LIMIT OUR RIGHTS AND

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.943
OUR VOICES.

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:25.578
I REMEMBER WHEN THE WHOLE LARRY

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:31.684
SECOND I CAN BELIEVE USA

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:35.688

MANY YEARS AND ME BEING.

I WAS WATCHING EVERY DAY I SAW

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:44.097
THOSE YOUNG GIRLS TESTIFY AND I

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:45.198
WAS SO PROUD THAT THEY GOT UP

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.833
THERE.

BUT ALL OF THAT WAS OVERSHADOWED

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:10.036
BY THE FACT THAT WE ALSO SHARE

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:14.140

THIS BILL.

THE AUTHOR HAS ALSO STATED.

01:59:23.022 --> 01:59:24.023
THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:26.158
BECAUSE USC HAS ENGAGED IN

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.630
AS WOMEN HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT

IS ALMOST INHERENTLY A SOMEWHAT

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:34.700
HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE OF GOING

02:09:34.766 --> 02:09:36.568
THROUGH A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM IT

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.336
IS.

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:38.871
AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:40.706
MOMENTS IN ONE'S LIFE AND TO

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:41.507

[inaudible]

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:48.347
OF JUST THE TAKES MY BREATH WAY

OF ALL OF YOU THEIR MEANING FULL

02:09:52.651 --> 02:09:54.086

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:55.220
THAT.

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.288
THIS KIND OF TREATMENT OF WOMEN

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:57.823
IS GONE ON SINCE THE BEGINNING

02:09:57.890 --> 02:10:01.393
OF TIME AND HOPEFULLY NOW WE ARE

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:02.661
WE'RE GONNA STOP IT.

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:03.629

DISTASTEFUL I THOUGHT THAT WAS

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.168
ONE OF THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:11.003
DAY IT IS ABSOLUTELY

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:12.571
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:35.594

THAT NOT ONLY DID THIS HAPPEN.

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:52.878
BUT THAT THE UNIVERSITY WAS WELL

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:55.247
AWARE OF THIS AND ALLOWED IT TO

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.749
CONTINUE FOR YEARS [inaudible]

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:59.751

MISTREATMENT OF HORRIFIC

02:13:10.749 --> 02:13:12.351
TREATMENT WITHIN THE CHURCH.

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:14.986
AND A SEXUAL PREDATORS OF THE

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.855
CHURCH KNEW ABOUT FOR DECADES IF

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:18.890
NOTHUNDREDS OF YEARS WE'VE DONE

02:13:18.957 --> 02:13:22.728
IT THERE SO -- WE HAVE IN FACT

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:24.396
REVIVED EXPIRED CIVIL CLAIMS IN

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:26.698
THE PAST THE QUESTION TODAY IS

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.633
WHETHER IT'S JUSTIFIED IN THIS

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.736
CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK THAT'S THE

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.070
QUESTION BEFORE US.

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:34.039
AND I THINK THAT THE SITUATIONS

02:13:34.106 --> 02:13:35.507
IN THE CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED

02:13:35.574 --> 02:13:36.908
BY THIS BILL.

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.877
DO WARRANT THIS EXTRAORDINARY

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:41.113
RELIEF READING THE STORIES OVER

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:44.816
AND OVER AGAIN -- YOU ARE NOT

02:13:44.883 --> 02:13:48.153
ALONE AND AS I SAID EARLIER THIS

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.121
IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:52.424
AND A YOUNG WOMEN.

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:53.759
THE WOMEN WHO'VE EXPERIENCES

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:55.260
SHOULD NOT BEAR.

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:57.596
THE GUILT OF THIS MISTREATMENT

02:13:57.662 --> 02:14:00.632
AND YET WE AS WOMEN DO.

02:14:00.699 --> 02:14:03.068
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE DO --

02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:04.770
WEATHER WHERE THE VICTIM OF

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:09.641
SEXUAL ABUSE RAPE -- OF DOMESTIC

02:14:09.708 --> 02:14:10.942
VIOLENCE SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:12.277
FEEL THAT IT'S OUR

02:14:12.344 --> 02:14:13.612
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.647
AND IT IS NOT BUT IT IS THE

02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:16.882
RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:19.751
UNIVERSITIES AND ANY INSTITUTION

02:14:19.818 --> 02:14:20.652
THAT IS AWARE THAT THIS IS

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:23.555
HAPPENING TO TAKE IMMEDIATE

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:24.689
STEPS. TO ENDED [inaudible]

02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:26.558
AND SO.

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:27.926
A I DON'T MAKE THAT DECISION

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:30.228
LIGHTLY BECAUSE AGAIN TO SOMEONE

02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:32.397
WHO BELIEVED SO FIRMLY IN THE

02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:34.766
JUDICIAL PROCESS -- THIS IS A

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:36.735
SITUATION THAT.

02:14:36.802 --> 02:14:38.870
THAT I THINK BEGS THE THE

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:41.306
RESPONSE AND IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:42.707
CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.509
THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN

02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:45.644
MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT ON THE

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:46.378
TABLE.

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:47.913
IF THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR AND

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:49.981
REASONABLE FOR VICTIMS THEY

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:50.949
WON'T OPT OUT THEY'LL

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:53.051
PARTICIPATE BUT THIS BILL AS I

02:14:53.118 --> 02:14:55.420
UNDERSTAND IT GIVES THOSE WHO

02:14:55.487 --> 02:14:56.288
HAVE TIME BARRED CLAIMS.

02:14:56.354 --> 02:14:58.590
A CHOICE. TO TAKE THE SETTLEMENT

02:14:58.657 --> 02:15:00.459
OFFER OR TO SEEK JUSTICE IN THE

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:02.928
COURTS PURSUANT TO THE REVIVAL

02:15:02.994 --> 02:15:04.262
PROVISION.

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:05.764
THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY I

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:09.334
FRANKLY THINK TWO HUNDRED AND

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:12.571
USC IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET.

02:15:12.637 --> 02:15:14.739
UP BUT IT IS A SETTLEMENT THAT

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.675
WAS OFFERED IN THE CORD.

02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:19.044
DID -- TO APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.212
THEN SO BE IT FOR THOSE WHO

02:15:20.278 --> 02:15:22.414
CHOOSE AND MAYBE FOR GOOD REASON

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:24.115
BUT I THINK FOR THOSE.

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:26.117
ARE FOR WHOM THE STATUTE HAS RUN

02:15:26.184 --> 02:15:27.419
IF THEY WANT TO ASSERT THEIR

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:29.921
CLAIMS GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:32.023
GIVEN WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:32.858
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEW.

02:15:32.924 --> 02:15:33.959
ARE THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:35.494
THE RIGHT TO DO THIS AND AS FAR

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.063
AS EXPANDING THIS PERHAPS GOING

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:38.997
FORWARD.

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:41.233
IF THERE ARE OTHER SITUATIONS

02:15:41.299 --> 02:15:43.568
WHERE THE FAX SERVICES GREGIS AS

02:15:43.635 --> 02:15:45.303
THEY ARE IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:47.372
HAPPEN AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:48.473
EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:50.242
INSTITUTION THAT IS GIVEN THE

02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:52.644
TRUST OF ITS STUDENTS OR ITS

02:15:52.711 --> 02:16:01.453
POPULATION -- IF THEY HAVE -- OF

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:03.555
NOT THE CARED FOR THEIR STUDENTS

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:05.690
OR THEIR POPULATION AS THEY

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:07.158
SHOULD.

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:08.727
THEIR DUTIES TO THEIR TO THEIR

02:16:08.793 --> 02:16:09.394
CONGREGANTS WHAT HAVE YOU WILL

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:11.062

PROCEED APPROPRIATELY GOING FOR

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:13.431
TO THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ONE MORE

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:15.066
DAY IN THE FUTURE -- I HOPE

02:16:15.133 --> 02:16:17.903
THERE WILL HAPPEN AS WELL AND SO --

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.037
THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS

02:16:19.104 --> 02:16:22.607
SUBJECT I RECOGNIZE -- THEIR

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:23.775
POINTS OF VIEW PASSIONATELY ON

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.977
BOTH SIDES BUT THIS KIND OF

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.812
THING HAS JOSH GOT TO STOP.

02:16:27.879 --> 02:16:31.149
AND IF WE GIVE THESE VICTIMS THE

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.384
OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THEIR

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.052
JUSTICE I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:35.253
IT'S APPROPRIATE UNDER THE

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.055
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH THAT I

02:16:37.122 --> 02:16:39.057

THERE'S A STORY THAT BROKE IN

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:40.652

BRIEFLY.

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:51.035
I'M I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:52.503
LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.205
WHAT ACTIONS THE UNIVERSITY HAS

02:21:54.272 --> 02:21:55.640
TAKEN ONCE ALLEGATIONS HAVE

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.842
RISEN WE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF

02:21:57.909 --> 02:21:59.410
YOUR OFFICES IN A LETTER THAT

02:21:59.477 --> 02:22:00.778
DETAILS.

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:03.681
VERY SPECIFICALLY THE TIMELINE

02:22:03.748 --> 02:22:04.249
OF ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:05.984
OFTEDAL AND THE ACTIONS THAT U.

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:08.052
S. HE TOOK AFTER EACH ALLEGATION.

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:10.355
AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS AND

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.390
AND ALSO JUST REMIND IF THIS IS

02:22:12.457 --> 02:22:13.958
A CASE ABOUT FRAUDULENT

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:15.860
CONCEALMENT AND IF USC IS BEING

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:16.327
ACCUSED.

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:18.529
OF ENGAGING IN THAT ACTIVITY

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:20.999
THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY TO

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.667
ALLOW THOSE WOMEN A REMEDY THERE

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:24.903
IS A REMEDY IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT

02:22:24.969 --> 02:22:26.371
NOW FOR THOSE PARTICULAR

02:22:26.437 --> 02:22:27.338
INSTANCES.

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:29.407
I THINK THAT WAS EXPLAINED BY

02:22:29.474 --> 02:22:31.743
THE ATTORNEY A PREVIOUSLY.

02:22:31.809 --> 02:22:34.145
ESSIE HAS FOUGHT THIS INCLUDE

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:39.550
QUARTZ -- VIGOROUSLY -- DENYING

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:44.656
OF BEHAVIOR IT HAS NOT.

02:22:44.722 --> 02:22:46.224
I THINK EVEN TODAY AND HAS NOT

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:47.625
DEMONSTRATED THE KIND OF REMORSE

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:51.462

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:53.197
VICTIMS OF BELIEVE IS

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:56.100
APPROPRIATE SO -- AND I THINK

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:57.068
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT THE

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.536
PEOPLE.

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:00.605

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:02.140
INADEQUATE SETTLEMENT SO.

02:23:02.206 --> 02:23:03.041

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:07.345
FACTS.

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:08.212
SET OF FACTS AND I THINK FOR

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:09.380
SOME OF US THAT'S REALLY THE

02:23:09.447 --> 02:23:11.015
REASON WE'RE WILLING.

02:23:11.082 --> 02:23:12.450
TO DEAL WITH THE STATURE

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:13.985
LIMITATIONS ISSUE.

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:18.690

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:32.470
THAT ROLLS THE PASSIONS -- AS

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:34.339
POLICY MAKERS I THINK IT'S

02:23:34.405 --> 02:23:36.174
INCUMBENT UPON US TO MAKE

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.042
CERTAIN THAT.

02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:40.712
WE DEVISE LEGISLATION IN

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:43.047
APPROVED LEGISLATION.

02:23:43.114 --> 02:23:46.617
THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE STATE.

02:23:46.684 --> 02:23:49.153
AND MY CONCERN IS WHEN WE HAVE

02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:51.089
CARVE OUT.

02:23:51.155 --> 02:23:54.525
OR ARE REALLY UNIQUE BOUTIQUE

02:23:54.592 --> 02:23:56.461
TYPES OF LEGISLATION THAT IT

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:58.596
WORKS AGAINST WHAT I THINK OUR

02:23:58.663 --> 02:24:01.332
CORE MISSION IS IS TO LOOK AFTER.

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:03.901

AND I'VE HEARD SOME EXPLANATION

02:24:09.273 --> 02:24:11.342
AS TO WHY S. C. AND I'M

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:12.944

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:29.127

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:58.389
MORE DIFFICULT TO DO SO.

02:24:58.456 --> 02:24:59.991

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:35.646
THE SET OF FACTS THE EXPANSION

02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:37.715
OF THE STATURE LIMITATIONS IS

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:39.150
VERY LIMITED TO A PARTICULAR SET

02:27:39.217 --> 02:27:41.152
OF FACTS IF THERE ARE OTHER

02:27:41.219 --> 02:27:43.454
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COME FORWARD.

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:45.356
THAT HAVE A SET OF FACTS THAT

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:46.591
THE AUTHOR BELIEVES WOULD

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:48.559
JUSTIFY THIS ADDITIONAL

02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:50.261
EXPANSION OF THE STATUTE.

02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:52.163
THEN THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.630
THAT THIS.

02:27:52.697 --> 02:27:53.831
THERE WOULD COME TO THIS

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:57.168
COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION SO.

02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:58.469
IF YOU WANT MY QUESTION DO YOU

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:00.738
HAVE A QUESTION I DO RIGHT --

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:02.473
ONE THE YOU'VE NOT ANSWERED --

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:07.144
THE IDEA IS.

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:08.479
AND WE EXT WE EXPECT THIS IN IN

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:09.247
OUR IN OUR COMMITTEE IN OUR

02:28:09.313 --> 02:28:10.147
FORUM THAT IF SOMETHING IS

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:11.983
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:14.318
AND BRING UP A SUBSEQUENT PIECE

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:15.720
OF LEGISLATION FORWARD.

02:28:15.786 --> 02:28:17.221
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:20.625
THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE

02:28:20.691 --> 02:28:21.425
EARLY.

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:24.729
AN ODD THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

02:28:24.795 --> 02:28:25.997
SO WHY DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:28:26.063 --> 02:28:28.199
WHY THIS WAS INCORPORATED INTO

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:30.034
IT WHAT AM I MISSING WHAT ARE

02:28:30.101 --> 02:28:32.136
THE FORCES AT PLAY THAT IS OUR

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.104
IS KEEPING THIS.

02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:36.007
FROM OCCURRING.

02:28:36.073 --> 02:28:37.842
MAY I JUST SAY.

02:28:37.908 --> 02:28:40.077
WHAT IN INJUSTICES WOULD BE?

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:41.646
IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE OTHER

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:42.980
UNIVERSITIES WHERE.

02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.615

THERE WAS A SERIOUS

02:29:07.872 --> 02:29:10.341

02:35:29.086 --> 02:35:30.921
ENTIRE STOCK OF LOW COST COASTAL

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:32.523
ACCOMMODATION.

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:34.258
THAT MEANS ONE IN ONE THOUSAND

02:35:34.324 --> 02:35:35.159
PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN

02:35:35.225 --> 02:35:36.860
SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS FAR

02:35:36.927 --> 02:35:40.197
ABOVE THE REST OF THE STATE IN

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:40.964
ANY OTHER COUNTY.

02:35:41.031 --> 02:35:42.032
AND SO WE DO A GOOD JOB OF

02:35:42.099 --> 02:35:42.666
PROVIDING LOW COST BECAUSE OF

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.601
COMBINATIONS WE DO NOT HAVE A

02:35:44.668 --> 02:35:46.503
COASTAL LOW COST ACCOMMODATION

02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:48.238
PROBLEM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.640
BUT WE DO HAVE A CROWD HOUSING

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:51.408
CRISIS EXACERBATED BY THE

02:35:51.475 --> 02:35:52.409
PROLIFERATION OF SHORT TERM

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:53.677
VACATION RENTALS WHICH ARE

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:54.812
REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:55.979
HOUSING STOCK.

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.381
ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE POPULARITY

02:35:57.448 --> 02:35:58.615
EASE THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN BE

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.384
RENTED OVER SHORT TERM VACATION

02:36:00.451 --> 02:36:03.187
RENTAL PLATFORMS -- AND THIS IS

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:04.354
ESPECIALLY ISSUE WHEN IT AN

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:06.256
ADVERT LEE INCENTIVIZE FULL TIME

02:36:06.323 --> 02:36:07.891
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS OVER

LONG TERM RENTALS WE SEE THAT.

02:36:10.861 --> 02:36:12.329
LONG TERM RENTAL RATES INCREASE

02:36:12.396 --> 02:36:13.430
AND IT'S JUST A SIMPLE SUPPLY

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:14.598
AND DEMAND IF WE ALL GO BACK TO

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:16.233
ECONOMICS ONE A ONE WE KNOW WHAT

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:17.201
THIS IS.

02:36:17.267 --> 02:36:19.069
CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT FOURTEEN

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:19.837
THOUSAND SHORT TERM VACATION

02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.505
RENTALS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOST

02:36:21.572 --> 02:36:22.906
OF WHICH ARE FULL TIME.

02:36:22.973 --> 02:36:25.242
WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.843
FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME SHORT

02:36:25.909 --> 02:36:27.544

DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE.

02:36:29.246 --> 02:36:30.414
AND WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:31.682
STATE HOW IT WHAT HOUSING CRISIS

02:36:31.749 --> 02:36:34.518
WE ALLOW THE DE FACTO DEMOLITION

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:37.187
OF FIVE THOUSAND UNITS IN SAN

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:39.189
DIEGO COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM.

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:40.491
I NOT HAVE THEM BE REPLACED.

02:36:40.557 --> 02:36:42.092
THIS MEANS THERE FIVE THOUSAND

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:44.061
UNITS NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY OR

02:36:44.128 --> 02:36:46.029
RENT LONG TERM FOR FAMILIES

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:47.664
SENIORS VETERANS ARE WORKERS.

02:36:47.731 --> 02:36:49.032
DECREASE THE SUPPLY WHICH WE ON

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:50.601
THOSE INCREASES RENT AND HOUSING

02:36:50.667 --> 02:36:51.802
PRICES.

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:52.936
AND REMEMBER THESE UNITS ARE

02:36:53.003 --> 02:36:55.038
COUNTED IN CITIES RENO NUMBERS

02:36:55.105 --> 02:36:56.240
FOR HOUSING NOT VISITORS SERVING

02:36:56.306 --> 02:36:58.075
USES WHICH SHORT TERM VACATION

02:36:58.142 --> 02:37:00.978
RENTALS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ARE.

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:02.246
WELL NOT ALL THESE RENTALS WILL

02:37:02.312 --> 02:37:03.847
BE AFFORDABLE I THINK THAT IT'S

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:05.315
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THEY PUSH

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:06.817
HIGHER INCOME FOLKS DOWN THE

02:37:06.884 --> 02:37:08.252
HOUSING MARKET WHICH THEIR

FULLER FOR CAUSES DISPLACEMENT

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:11.722

ADDRESSES MARKET DESTRUCTION I

02:37:15.125 --> 02:37:17.127
AUTHORED AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:18.862
IT'S NEARLY TAILORED TO PROBABLY

02:37:18.929 --> 02:37:20.364
REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:21.799
RENTAL PLATFORMS IN THE SAN

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:23.233
DIEGO COUNTY COUNCILS ON AND I

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.835
WANT TO GET AT THAT BECAUSE OF

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:25.602
THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:26.303
PLATFORMS.

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:28.071
THAT ARE CAUSING THIS MASSIVE

02:37:28.138 --> 02:37:29.940
MARKET DISTORTION IN IMPERIAL

02:37:30.007 --> 02:37:31.375
BEACH WHICH IS ONE OF OUR

02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:32.743
COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND ALSO WON

02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:34.378
THE POOREST CITIES IN THE SAN

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:35.312
DIEGO COUNTY.

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:36.747
THEY USE A LOT OF POLITICAL

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:38.248
CAPITAL WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD TO

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:40.918
BUILD IN THE COASTAL ZONE -- AND

02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:43.487
THEY BUILT A TWO HUNDRED THEY

02:37:43.554 --> 02:37:44.855
APPROVED A TWO HUNDRED UNIT --

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:47.124
MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT TWENTY

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.458
FIVE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED UNITS

02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:49.626
WITHIN THREE MONTHS OUR FULL

02:37:49.693 --> 02:37:51.261
TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS.

02:37:51.328 --> 02:37:53.030
I PREDICT IT'LL BE FIFTY BY THE

02:37:53.096 --> 02:37:54.398
END OF THE YEAR.

02:37:54.464 --> 02:37:55.966
THOSE WERE HOMES AND APARTMENTS

02:37:56.033 --> 02:37:57.935
MEANT FOR FOLKS THEY WERE NOT

02:37:58.001 --> 02:37:59.403
MEANT TO BE VISITORS SERVING

02:37:59.469 --> 02:38:01.471
USES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE A

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:03.707
PROLIFERATION AND THE SUCCESS

02:38:03.774 --> 02:38:04.341
REALLY OF THE SHORT TERM

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.109
VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS.

02:38:06.176 --> 02:38:07.644
ARE DOING TO OUR HOUSING MARKET

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:09.213
AT SOME POINT I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:11.181
BE REALLY HONEST DO WE HAVE A

02:38:11.248 --> 02:38:12.816
HOUSING CRISIS OR DO WE HAVE A

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:14.318
SHORT TERM VACATION IN A CRISIS

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:16.186
AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE.

02:38:16.253 --> 02:38:17.988
WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS.

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:19.656
AT ITS CORE.

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:21.625
AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE A LOT

02:38:21.692 --> 02:38:23.627
ALLOWS LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.028
WHILE PRESERVING THE ROLE

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:26.230
PREVENTING THE REMOVAL OF

02:38:26.296 --> 02:38:27.764
HOUSING FOR THE HOUSING STOCK.

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:28.966
DUE TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM

02:38:29.032 --> 02:38:31.168
VACATION RENTALS AND MANY HOTELS

02:38:31.235 --> 02:38:35.272
PROLIFERATING WITH ANY OF COUNTY

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:37.140
COUNCILS ON AS A PRIMARY

02:38:37.207 --> 02:38:37.875
RESIDENCE ON SITE.

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.476
THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL.

02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:40.477
IF THE CITY ZONES AREA

02:38:40.544 --> 02:38:41.411
RESIDENTIAL TOURISM THEY'RE

02:38:41.478 --> 02:38:42.446
EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL.

02:38:42.512 --> 02:38:43.914
IF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS NOT

02:38:43.981 --> 02:38:45.515
ON SITE IN THE SHORT TERM

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:46.717
VACATION WITH A PLATFORM MAY

02:38:46.783 --> 02:38:48.986
BOOK THAT UNIT FOR UP TO THIRTY

02:38:49.052 --> 02:38:49.820
DAYS.

02:38:49.887 --> 02:38:51.054
AND THAT IF THE IF THE USER

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:52.756
DECIDES A PLATFORM HOP THAT'S

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:54.224
NINETY DAYS TOTAL PER YEAR.

02:38:54.291 --> 02:38:55.692
THAT INCLUDES ALMOST EVERY

02:38:55.759 --> 02:38:58.495
SINGLE WEEKEND IN A YEAR OR THE

02:38:58.562 --> 02:38:59.630
ENTIRE SUMMER.

02:38:59.696 --> 02:39:01.298
THAT'S APPROPRIATE HOME SHARING

02:39:01.365 --> 02:39:03.267
THAT DOES NOT REMOVE HOUSING

02:39:03.333 --> 02:39:04.434
FROM THE HOUSING STOCK.

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:07.037
AND AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:07.938
ALLOWS RETURN OF MUCH READ

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:09.539
NEEDED TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX TO

02:39:09.606 --> 02:39:11.241
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THIS IS THE

02:39:11.308 --> 02:39:12.943
TAX THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:14.878
USED TO ACCOMMODATE THE SERVICES

02:39:14.945 --> 02:39:18.081
NEEDED FOR THEIR THEIR INTEREST

02:39:18.148 --> 02:39:18.715
POPULATION.

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:21.518
AND THIS IS CRITICAL TO ALLOW --

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:23.020
THE IMPACT OF THE SHORT TERM

02:39:23.086 --> 02:39:24.421
VACATION RENTALS ON THE

02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:26.223
COMMUNITIES TO BE RECOVERED BY

02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:27.824
CITIES AND ALSO A LOT OF LOCAL

02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:30.193
JURISDICTIONS TO COMPARE WHO'S

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:30.894
RENTING OUT WHO'S GOTTEN A

02:39:30.961 --> 02:39:31.628
PERMIT.

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:33.997
AND COMPARE THAT BACK TO THEIR

02:39:34.064 --> 02:39:35.599
LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESS

02:39:35.666 --> 02:39:36.166
SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE DONE

02:39:36.233 --> 02:39:37.434
RIGHT NOW.

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:38.335
I'D LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT

02:39:38.402 --> 02:39:39.603
THE MEMBERS TAKEN THIS COMMITTEE

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.371
MEANS THIS IS A THREE YEAR PILOT

02:39:41.438 --> 02:39:42.072
INSTEAD OF THE PROPOSED FIVE

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:44.007
YEAR PILOT -- AND WE WILL HAVE A

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:44.875
MUCH NEED.

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.877
A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY AT THE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:48.812
END -- SHOWING WHAT THE EFFECT

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:49.813
OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.581
RENTAL PLATFORMS ARE ON THE

02:39:51.648 --> 02:39:53.183
HOUSING MARKET AND SAN DIEGO

02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:53.684
COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE.

02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:55.419
SPECIFICALLY I'M INTERESTED IN

02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:56.887
TWO THINGS WHICH IS WHAT THE

02:39:56.954 --> 02:39:58.789
EFFECT ON LONG TERM RENTAL RATES

02:39:58.855 --> 02:39:59.990
WHAT'S THE BY FACT ON HOUSING

02:40:00.057 --> 02:40:00.991
AVAILABILITY.

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:02.225
THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN'T KNOW

02:40:02.292 --> 02:40:03.293
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.461
BETWEEN THE SHORT TERM VACATION

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:06.029
RENTAL PLATFORMS.

02:40:06.096 --> 02:40:08.432
AND THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITTING

02:40:08.498 --> 02:40:09.299
THAT HAPPENS IN THE CITY.

02:40:09.366 --> 02:40:10.267
THIS BILL IS ALSO SIMPLE TO

02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:11.501
IMPLEMENT IT REQUIRES FIVE FORMS

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:13.437
ADD PRACTICALLY FOR CHECK BOXES

02:40:13.503 --> 02:40:14.771
THAT WOULD CATEGORIES A UNIT IN

02:40:14.838 --> 02:40:15.539
THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S COASTAL

02:40:15.605 --> 02:40:16.373
ZONE.

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.408
AS ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL IS A

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:20.110
ARE YOU THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE

02:40:20.177 --> 02:40:21.945
ARE YOU ON SITE OR OFFSITE ARE

02:40:22.012 --> 02:40:23.680
YOU A RENTER AND IF YOU ARE TO

02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:24.214
HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE

LANDLORD TO RENT AS A SHORT TERM

02:40:25.415 --> 02:40:26.616
VACATION RENTAL.

02:40:26.683 --> 02:40:28.318
RIGHT IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE BALL

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:30.787
IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE MET THEN

02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:33.924
IT SAYS THIRTY DAYS MAXIMUM

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:35.158
BOOKING OVER THE PLATFORM.

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:35.959
CITIES WILL RECEIVE THIS

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:37.327
INFORMATION CITIES WILL RECEIVE

02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:38.061
THIS INFORMATION FROM THE TO

02:40:38.128 --> 02:40:39.363
YOUR TEAM BE ABLE TO ENFORCE FOR

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:40.931
THEIR LOCAL POLICIES.

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:42.666
AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE PROTECTS

02:40:42.733 --> 02:40:44.601
PROPERTY RIGHTS BY APPROPRIATELY

02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:45.736
REGULATING SHORT TERM VACATION

02:40:45.802 --> 02:40:47.170
RENTAL PLATFORMS.

02:40:47.237 --> 02:40:49.306
RATHER THAN REGULATING PROPERTY

02:40:49.373 --> 02:40:49.773
OWNER SOIT'S A LITTLE

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:51.708
COMPLICATED TO GET NOTHING SOME

02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:52.442
FOR SOME FOLKS IN THE HEAD

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:54.211
AROUND THAT -- THEY CAN STILL

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:55.278
RENT YOU KNOW ANY OF THE

02:40:55.345 --> 02:40:56.680
PROPERTY OWNERS CAN STILL WRITE

02:40:56.747 --> 02:40:57.381
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

02:40:57.447 --> 02:40:59.082
PLATFORMS AS THEY DID BEFORE THE

02:40:59.149 --> 02:41:01.451
ADVENT OF THESE PLATFORMS -- AND

02:41:01.518 --> 02:41:02.452
THAT MEANS THE COMMISSION TO

02:41:02.519 --> 02:41:03.720
FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEY CAN PUT

02:41:03.787 --> 02:41:05.255
A SIGN FROM THEIR HOUSE THEY CAN

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:06.656
HAVE THEIR OWN WEBSITE OF COURSE

02:41:06.723 --> 02:41:08.091
NOTHING STOPS.

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:09.526
ANY OF THE OF THE PROPERTY

02:41:09.593 --> 02:41:11.395
OWNERS FROM RENTING LONG TERM.

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:12.829
OR FOR NINE MONTHS WE HAVE LOTS

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:13.563
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE HOUSING AND

02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:15.032
SECURE THERE'S LOTS OF FOLKS

02:41:15.098 --> 02:41:16.900
THAT WOULD RENTED OUT DURING THE

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:18.602
THE THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THEN

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:21.671
DURING THE SUMMER THEY COULD

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:22.139
HAVE THAT IS THEIR OWN

02:41:22.205 --> 02:41:24.007
INDIVIDUAL USE -- AND SO ON THE

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:24.608
ISSUE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS I'D

02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:25.275
LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:27.010
DOES NOT REGULATE THE USE OF

02:41:27.077 --> 02:41:28.245

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:29.646
TERM VACATION RENTAL.

02:41:29.713 --> 02:41:31.415
THAT'S THE JOB OF THE CITY BUT

02:41:31.481 --> 02:41:33.183
ONLY RECORD REGULATES THE

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:34.384

PLATFORM CAN BOOK IT.

02:41:35.719 --> 02:41:37.654
SO AS A POINT OF FACT USE OF A

02:53:35.271 --> 02:53:36.239
OCEANS THAT ASK FOR THAT

02:53:36.305 --> 02:53:37.206
AMENDMENT AND WE TOOK OUT OF MY

02:53:37.273 --> 02:53:39.041
MEANT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:39.108 --> 02:53:40.143
THERE'S THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:53:40.209 --> 02:53:41.611
AND THAT'S THE MECHANISM FOR THE

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:43.146
OPT OUT PROVISION SO STATE

02:53:43.212 --> 02:53:44.647
CREATE A RESIDENT AND TOURISM SO

02:53:44.714 --> 02:53:46.682
IN A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM OVERLAY

02:53:46.749 --> 02:53:49.218
OVER THERE BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:53:49.285 --> 02:53:49.685
OPTED OUT OF THE BILL

02:53:49.752 --> 02:53:49.986
[inaudible]

02:53:50.052 --> 02:53:50.987
OKAY.

02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:52.789
THE GOOD THE OTHER QUESTIONS

02:53:52.855 --> 02:53:53.089
[inaudible]

02:53:53.156 --> 02:53:54.891
SENATOR DORADO [inaudible]

02:53:54.957 --> 02:53:57.693
YES -- I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS

02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:00.663
ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS --

02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:03.099
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:05.234
ISSUES IN LOS ANGELES -- AND

02:54:05.301 --> 02:54:07.637
THIS IS A BEEN A VERY VERY --

02:54:07.703 --> 02:54:11.073
GOTTEN CONTENTIOUS AT TIMES BUT

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:13.176
I THINK AS WE WE STEP BACK AND

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:14.944
LOOK AT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT

02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:17.580
ARE IMPACTING OUR HOUSING STOCK.

02:54:17.647 --> 02:54:20.149
JUST HOUSING AVAILABILITY THIS

02:54:20.216 --> 02:54:21.918
HAS TO BE.

02:54:21.984 --> 02:54:24.821
FACTUALLY SEEN AS A PART.

02:54:24.887 --> 02:54:27.690
OF OF THE CAUSE OF HOUSING

02:54:27.757 --> 02:54:28.858
SHORTAGE.

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:30.927
NOT THE WHOLE NOT EVERYTHING BUT

02:54:30.993 --> 02:54:33.996
A PART OF AND WE CAN'T GO FROM

02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:35.998
ONE ROOM TALK ABOUT HOUSING --

02:54:36.065 --> 02:54:38.467
STOCKY SHORTAGE AND TO THE

02:54:38.534 --> 02:54:39.402
EMERGENCY AND HUSING

02:54:39.468 --> 02:54:41.337
AVAILABILITY AND THEN TURN

02:54:41.404 --> 02:54:43.206
AROUND AND ALLOW THIS TO

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:46.776
CONTINUE TO TO HAPPEN SO I I

02:54:46.843 --> 02:54:47.610
BEEN.

02:54:47.677 --> 02:54:49.712
INVOLVED IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.

02:54:49.779 --> 02:54:51.147
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE

02:54:51.214 --> 02:54:54.350
ECONOMY OF THIS STATE TOURISM

02:54:54.417 --> 02:54:56.886
PROVIDES AND CREATES HUNDREDS OF

02:54:56.953 --> 02:54:58.321
THOUSANDS OF JOBS.

02:54:58.387 --> 02:55:00.890
ALL OF THE HOTELS THE MOTELS

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:02.725
EVERYONE WHO HAS INVESTED IN

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:04.727
CREATING THAT PART OF OUR

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:06.796
TOURISM INDUSTRY KNOWS HOW

02:55:06.863 --> 02:55:10.166
IMPORTANT THAT IS AND SO ON YOU

02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:12.301
KNOW TO SAY THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW

02:55:12.368 --> 02:55:14.136
GOING TO PROVIDE.

02:55:14.203 --> 02:55:18.774
LOW COST HOUSING -- FOR TOURIST

02:55:18.841 --> 02:55:20.309
IS NOT TRUE.

02:55:20.376 --> 02:55:22.845
NOT TRUE THERE IN FACT THEIR

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:24.747
RENTED THAT MUCH HIGHER MUCH

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:26.782
HIGHER RATES A BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:55:26.849 --> 02:55:29.318
TRYING -- TO YOU KNOW -- TAKE

02:55:29.385 --> 02:55:31.187
ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE COMING IN SO

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:32.622
THIS IS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS.

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.290
THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST

02:55:34.357 --> 02:55:36.626
HOUSING IN THE COASTAL AREA SO I

02:55:36.692 --> 02:55:38.794
THINK THIS IS A REALLY REALLY

02:55:38.861 --> 02:55:40.596
IMPORTANT -- PIECE OF

02:55:40.663 --> 02:55:42.832
LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT AND I

02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:44.367
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:46.669
YOU HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN AS

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:47.970
MUCH AS YOU HAVE.

02:55:48.037 --> 02:55:48.905
I AT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:50.907
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO BUT YOU

02:55:50.973 --> 02:55:52.608
NARROWED IT DOWN IN SUCH A WAY

02:55:52.675 --> 02:55:55.311
THAT IS EXTREMELY REASONABLE AND

02:55:55.378 --> 02:55:56.445
FAIR SELF.

02:55:56.512 --> 02:55:57.980
I THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN.

02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:59.115
US SENATOR MONNING.

02:55:59.181 --> 02:56:00.783

02:56:00.850 --> 02:56:02.652
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO

02:56:02.718 --> 02:56:04.754
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR.

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:06.055
FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS FOR

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:07.356
THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS I

02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:09.091
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED

02:56:09.158 --> 02:56:11.594
BY THE OPPOSITION IT'S A HUGE

02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:14.230
ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT BUT IT'S A

02:56:14.297 --> 02:56:15.631
TOURISM DISTRICT.

02:56:15.698 --> 02:56:17.800
BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT CITIES

02:56:17.867 --> 02:56:18.935
WITH DIFFERENT ORDINANCES WE

02:56:19.001 --> 02:56:20.636
HAVE COASTAL ZONE.

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:22.672
WE HAVE SOME CITIES ALLOWING

02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:24.774
KNOW AIRBNB NO SHORT TERM

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.876
RENTALS WE HAVE OTHERS TRYING TO

02:56:26.943 --> 02:56:28.544
REGULATE IT.

02:56:28.611 --> 02:56:29.612
THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE A

02:56:29.679 --> 02:56:32.281
PILOT PROGRAM I THINK IT COULD

02:56:32.348 --> 02:56:34.617
EDUCATE OTHERS OF US IN OTHER

02:56:34.684 --> 02:56:36.218
PARTS OF THE STATE HOW WE MOVE

02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:37.119
FORWARD.

02:56:37.186 --> 02:56:38.921
THERE'S THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION

02:56:38.988 --> 02:56:40.623
TO THIS WE DO KNOW IN MY

02:56:40.690 --> 02:56:41.691
DISTRICT.

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:43.492
HOUSING THAT USED TO BE

02:56:43.559 --> 02:56:45.528
AVAILABLE TO WORK FORCE. FOR

02:56:45.594 --> 02:56:47.296
LEASE AGREEMENTS.

02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:49.332
IS NOW OFF THE MARKET AND IT'S

02:56:49.398 --> 02:56:52.935
BEING RENTED OUT AT HIGHER RATES

02:56:53.002 --> 02:56:54.770
FOR WEEKEND USE ARM.

02:56:54.837 --> 02:56:56.339
AND IT'S AFFECTING NEIGHBORHOODS

02:56:56.405 --> 02:56:57.773
BUT WE HAVE WORKFORCE NOW

02:56:57.840 --> 02:56:59.241
COMMUTING FROM FARTHER AND

02:56:59.308 --> 02:57:02.111
FARTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS

02:57:02.178 --> 02:57:03.412
BECAUSE WHERE THEY USED TO BE

02:57:03.479 --> 02:57:04.613
ABLE TO RENT.

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:06.549
A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE IN BIG SUR

02:57:06.615 --> 02:57:08.751
ON A ONE YEAR LEASE.

02:57:08.818 --> 02:57:10.086
THAT'S NOW BEING RENTED ON

02:57:10.152 --> 02:57:13.089
WEEKENDS FOR AS MUCH AS THEY

02:57:13.155 --> 02:57:14.123
WERE PAYING PER MONTH.

02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:15.091
BUT THEY'RE DRIVING FROM

02:57:15.157 --> 02:57:17.760
WATSONVILLE SALINAS.

02:57:17.827 --> 02:57:19.996
LOS BANOS PEOPLE ARE COMMON OVER

02:57:20.062 --> 02:57:23.499
THE MOUNTAINS TO THEIR JOBS SO.

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:26.469
LETTING IT GO UNREGULATED I

02:57:26.535 --> 02:57:28.804
DON'T THINK IS THE ANSWER -- ALL

02:57:28.871 --> 02:57:30.406
BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT

02:57:30.473 --> 02:57:32.875
I'LL BE WATCHING TO LEARN

02:57:32.942 --> 02:57:35.444
LESSONS -- THAT CAN HOPEFULLY

02:57:35.511 --> 02:57:36.746
INFORMANTS.

02:57:36.812 --> 02:57:37.980
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

02:57:38.047 --> 02:57:38.848
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:40.483
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:57:40.549 --> 02:57:46.856
CENTER BORCHERS.

02:57:46.922 --> 02:57:48.391
IF IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK JUST LET

02:57:48.457 --> 02:57:49.692
ME KNOW BY RAISING HIM OR

02:57:49.759 --> 02:57:51.160
SOMETHING I'M MY MENTAL

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:53.796
TELEPATHY SO OF SKILLS -- A

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:55.564
FADING WITH AGE.

02:57:55.631 --> 02:57:57.967
BUT MINE AS WELL AND I THANK YOU

02:57:58.034 --> 02:57:59.802
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU -- AT THE

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:03.639
PROCEED SORRY I WAS -- WAS THANK

02:58:03.706 --> 02:58:05.441
YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND THERE

02:58:05.508 --> 02:58:06.475
BORDERS I'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION

02:58:06.542 --> 02:58:07.576
LATER ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE EACH

02:58:07.643 --> 02:58:09.245
OTHER'S -- QUESTIONS I SUPPOSE

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:12.381
SO -- JUST A QUICK QUESTION --

02:58:12.448 --> 02:58:13.482
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS

02:58:13.549 --> 02:58:15.851
BROUGHT UP -- WAS INVESTMENT

02:58:15.918 --> 02:58:18.120
VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES -- IF

02:58:18.187 --> 02:58:19.422
THIS BILL PASSES AND AND THEN

02:58:19.488 --> 02:58:21.023
SOME SOME AND THEN ADDITIONAL

02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:23.793
CONCERN ON THE THE TERM OF THIS

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:26.629
OF THE I GUESS THE STUDY YOUR

02:58:26.695 --> 02:58:28.364
PILOT PROGRAM YOU KNOW THREE

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:29.598
YEARS FIVE YEARS THREE YEARS IN

02:58:29.665 --> 02:58:33.536
A LONG ENOUGH. TO GET YOU KNOW

02:58:33.602 --> 02:58:35.304
LEARN THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT --

02:58:35.371 --> 02:58:36.572
BUT SOMEHOW FIVE YEARS WAS IT

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:40.242
ENDED UP BEING TOO LONG -- THE

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:44.380
TWO QUESTIONS -- ONE AT HOW DO

02:58:44.447 --> 02:58:45.915
YOU DRESS FOR THE INVESTORS

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:47.850
ABOUT THESE HOMES FOR THIS AS AN

02:58:47.917 --> 02:58:49.418
INVESTMENT VALUE.

02:58:49.485 --> 02:58:52.755
AND TO A CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE

02:58:52.822 --> 02:58:55.658
LENGTH OF THE PILOT.

02:58:55.724 --> 02:58:57.693
YES I I THINK THREE HERE ARE THE

02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:59.562
SECOND QUESTION FIRST I THINK

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:02.131
THREE YEARS IS ON THE THE SHORT

02:59:02.198 --> 02:59:02.765
END FIVE YEARS WAS ON THE HIGH

02:59:02.832 --> 02:59:04.800
END -- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK

02:59:04.867 --> 02:59:06.235
THERE WERE THERE WAS A SENTIMENT

02:59:06.302 --> 02:59:08.104
OF THREE YEARS IS SUFFICIENT I

02:59:08.170 --> 02:59:08.771
THINK WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT

02:59:08.838 --> 02:59:09.772
HAPPENS.

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:11.073
WITHIN THREE YEARS I THINK THE

02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:13.109
FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION

02:59:13.175 --> 02:59:14.743
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE IF YOU SEE

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.545
THE TRANSITION SO IF YOU'RE TWO

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:17.113
ONE THREE THAT WILL GIVE YOU

02:59:17.179 --> 02:59:18.547
ACTUAL DATA.

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:19.548
AND THAT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO

02:59:19.615 --> 02:59:21.650
DO REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO GO YOU

02:59:21.717 --> 02:59:23.719
KNOW -- ACCOUNT FOR OTHER

02:59:23.786 --> 02:59:24.987
FACTORS GOING ON THE MARKET

02:59:25.054 --> 02:59:25.988
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING

02:59:26.055 --> 02:59:27.356
TO BE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S THE

02:59:27.423 --> 02:59:28.691
EFFECT ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY

02:59:28.757 --> 02:59:30.059
WHAT EFFECTS ON LONG TERM RENTS.

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:32.094
AND WE KNOW THIS IS ONE ASPECT

02:59:32.161 --> 02:59:32.528
TO IT.

02:59:32.595 --> 02:59:33.762
THE SECOND IN TERMS OF

02:59:33.829 --> 02:59:35.564
INVESTMENT VALUE I BELIEVE --

02:59:35.631 --> 02:59:37.399
THE AIRBNB REPRESENTATIVE IN THE

02:59:37.466 --> 02:59:39.668
ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY ACTUALLY

02:59:39.735 --> 02:59:42.705
TESTIFIED THAT LONG TERM RENTAL --

02:59:42.771 --> 02:59:44.373
AMOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN

02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:45.608
SHORT TERM RENTAL RATES BECAUSE

02:59:45.674 --> 02:59:47.243
YOU DON'T RENT OUT SHORT TERM

02:59:47.309 --> 02:59:49.111
VACATION RENTALS THE ENTIRE YEAR.

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:50.513
IF I'M IF I'M CORRECT JOHN CAN

02:59:50.579 --> 02:59:53.182
CORRECT ME IF I AM INCORRECT BUT

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:54.316
AND THAT'S THE THING IS YOU CAN

02:59:54.383 --> 02:59:55.351
GET THAT AND I WOULD WANT TO

02:59:55.417 --> 02:59:56.752
ADDRESS WITHOUT THE ECONOMIC

02:59:56.819 --> 03:00:03.092
IMPACT WHEN FAMILIES LIVE THEIR

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:06.428
FAMILIES LIVE IN A COMMUNITY.

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:07.263
SO SO I MEAN IF THE METER ON WE

03:00:07.329 --> 03:00:07.930
HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS

03:00:07.997 --> 03:00:08.697
YOU HAVE A TOURISM.

03:00:08.764 --> 03:00:09.231
ECONOMY.

03:00:09.298 --> 03:00:09.798
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE FAMILIES

03:00:09.865 --> 03:00:10.900
LIVING THERE YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:11.834
ECONOMY.

03:00:11.901 --> 03:00:12.768
THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO

03:00:12.835 --> 03:00:14.069
BIRTHDAY PARTIES THEY'RE GOING

03:00:14.136 --> 03:00:16.038
TO MUSIC LESSONS THEY'RE GOING

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:17.072
TO YOUR SCHOOLS ARE INVESTING

03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:18.974
YOUR PDAS THEIR VESTING NEAR

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.576
TOWN COUNCILS ARE INVESTING TIME.

03:00:20.643 --> 03:00:21.911
SO THERE'S A MONETARY AND NON

03:00:21.977 --> 03:00:23.879
MONETARY COMPONENT OF HAVING

03:01:29.378 --> 03:01:31.480
AREA COUNCIL STUDY OF THE MARKET

03:01:31.547 --> 03:01:32.982
IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S PRETTY

03:01:33.048 --> 03:01:34.450
MATURE MARKET FOR THESE SORTS OF

03:01:34.516 --> 03:01:35.184
THINGS.

03:01:35.251 --> 03:01:36.452
AND WHAT THAT STUDY POINTED OUT

03:01:36.518 --> 03:01:37.920
IS IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR AND

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:38.921
YOU'RE BUYING A PROPERTY.

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:40.789

IT'S THREE HUNDRED DAYS TO BREAK

03:01:53.669 --> 03:01:55.271

03:01:55.337 --> 03:01:56.305
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS BASED ON

03:01:56.372 --> 03:01:56.972
WHAT.

03:01:57.039 --> 03:01:58.274
THEY LOOKED AT SO WE HAVE FOUND

03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:00.142
ANECDOTALLY THAT THE NUMBER OF

03:02:00.209 --> 03:02:01.877

03:02:04.079 --> 03:02:04.913
OVERSTATED.

03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:06.582
AND WE'VE WORKED WITH LOCAL

03:02:06.649 --> 03:02:09.051
COMMUNITIES FINAL TO WORK AGAIN

03:02:09.118 --> 03:02:10.352

03:02:14.823 --> 03:02:15.991
WORKED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:02:16.058 --> 03:02:16.992
REMOVE THOSE FROM THE SITE SO

03:02:17.059 --> 03:02:19.295
THAT'S A A GOAL THAT WE SHARE WE

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:24.400
DON'T THINK THIS BILL GETS

03:02:24.466 --> 03:02:24.967
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO ADDRESSING

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:25.801

03:02:33.409 --> 03:02:34.143
ASPECT OF THAT BUT WE KNOW WE
