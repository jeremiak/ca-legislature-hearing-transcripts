AMONGST THEMSELVES WITH THE VISION TO BRING AN ORANGE COUNTY CEMETERY I WAS ONLY THERE VOICE AND THEN AS I BECAME CHAIR OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE THEN TOOK THIS ON. OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY LIKED TO HAVE HAD A VETERANS CEMETERY BUILT WE HAD FIRST ONE SITE THE ARTIST SITE THEN ANOTHER SITE A POTENTIAL STRAWBERRY SITE AND THAT A THIRD SAW THE GULF SITE. ALL WITHIN THE CITY OF IRVINE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED TO HAVE ANY OF THOSE SITES BUT BECAUSE OF LOCAL OPPOSITION AND NOT HAVING THE SUPPORT FROM THE CITY OF IRVINE NOT ME BUT THE VALUE IS GROUP MOVED ON TO A NEW SITE.

MANY MEMBERS IN THE CHAMBERS IN SUPPORT. MOVING ON TO OUR- OPPOSITION IS- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WHO STEP FORWARD. OKAY HERE IT'S MUCH EASIER. HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I AM HARVEY LIST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BILL THE GREAT PARK VETERANS CEMETERY. JOHN GELLER. SITTING TO MY RIGHT AND I ARE LONG TIME RESIDENTS IRVINE. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE. UNLESS AMENDED. BECAUSE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STATE VETERANS CEMETERY AT THE ORIGINAL HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ACRE ARTIST SITE. DESIGNATED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND SITUATED ON THE HISTORIC FORMER MCAS EL TORO. THIS HALLOWED GROUND ISNOW PART OF THE GREAT PARK IN IRVINE. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY CANNOT STAY AT THE ARE THE SITE EXCEPT FOR A RECALCITRANT CITY COUNCIL SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. BY THE WAY YOUR CONSULTANT DID A GREAT JOB ON THE ANALYSIS STATING SUCCINCTLY ON PAGE TWO AND I QUOTE. OPPONENTS THAT'S US MAKE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION MANY AROUND THE CONTENTION THAT THE ARTIST SITE ON THE FORMER. MCAS EL TORO IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION IS HAVING BEEN STUDIED AND APPROVED ITS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. ITS ZONING STATUS. ADDITIONALLY OPPONENTS SAY A NEW IRVINE CITY COUNCIL MAY YET DECIDE TO TRANSFER THE ARE THE PARCEL TO THE STATE. IRVINE CITIZENS OVERWHELMINGLY WANT THE CEMETERY ON THE ARTIST SITE AND THEY WILL VOTE FOR A NEW SUPPORTIVE CITY COUNCIL ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. THANK YOU HARVEY. IT SEEMS SENSELESS FOR THIS BILL TO STRIKE OUT THE PREFER A BOWL ARE TO SITE AND THEN NOT SPECIFY THOSE ENDORSEMENTS AT THE END OF THE ANALYSIS WELL THEY WERE ALL GATHERED BASED UPON THE FALSE PREMISE THAT THE ARTIST SITE WAS DEAD. FURTHER SHIPS IN CANYON IS ONLY TWO MILES FROM THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BORDER. ALL VETERANS WANTS IS A CENTRALLY LOCATED STATE OR NATIONAL CEMETERY WHERE THEY CAN USE THEIR FULL PROMISED BURIAL BENEFITS AND THE CENTRALLY LOCATED ARTIST SITES IS THE PERFECT LOCATION. SO WE RECOMMEND PUTTING BACK THE ALREADY STUDIED ARTIST SITES AND SPECIFYING THAT THE JIBSON CANYON SITES BE STUDIED ALSO. THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED FOR A THOROUGH STUDY SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GIVEN THAT THE COURSE- STUDY COSTS THAT AMOUNT AND DIDN'T HAVE THE GEOTECHNICAL ENVIRONMENTAL OR LAND USE PROBLEMS. LASTLY REQUIRE THAT RATHER THAN THE STATE SO THE VETERANS FUND IS NOT FURTHER DEPLETED. IN OTHER WORDS PLEASE REFER TO SENATE BILL NUMBER FORTY THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMMENTS IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. ANY OPPOSITION THE ROOM. ANY OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES. CENTERMAN TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. IN FIRST WE'LL GO TO LINE ONE FIFTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

MOVING TO THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY- MEMBERS WISH TO COMMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU AT MISTER CHAIR AND BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE MISTER BEAR DINO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ALONG SIDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA AND ALONGSIDE MANY OF THE VETERANS I CALLED IN TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE AS HAS BEEN SAID ON FOR TEN YEARS FOR TEN YEARS TO BRING A VETERANS CEMETERY. ORANGE COUNTY I'M AND I DO JUST WANT TO. READ AND THEN CONFER ASK A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR TO CONFIRM SAID THERE'S A COUPLE OF CLARIFYING POINTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT ARE VERY RELEVANT. TO ADD SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES THIS BILL DOES NOT PRIVILEGE THE GYPSUM CANYON LOCATION BUT WOULD MAKE IT ELIGIBLE ALONG WITH ANY OTHER LOCATION IN ORANGE COUNTY INCLUDING THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED. EL TORO SITES. ANNOUNCES GOES ON TO SAY THIS BILL WOULD NOT RULE OUT CONSTRUCTION OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY AT EITHER OF THE PROPOSED SITES ON THE FORMER MCAS EL TORO. FIVE AND SO POINT ONE AND POINT TO THAT IS MADE IN THE COMPANY ANALYSIS. GOES ON TO SAY IT IS ALSO NOT NECESSARY TO SPENT. A PART IN STATUTE THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY WAS BUILT NEAR READY WITH STATUTE REQUIRING THAT IT BE FELT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M TAKE RODNEY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IT MEMBER CREW. THAT THAT IS IN FACT IN ACCURATE SUMMARY OF OTHERS TWO PROVISIONS CRACKED. YES AND WE DELIBERATELY DID NOT ADD GYPSUM CANYON IN THIS WE WANTED TO KEEP IT OPEN TO ORANGE COUNTY AS- YOU ALL KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN- THE FIRST ATTEMPT ARDA. THE SECOND ATTEMPT THE STRAWBERRY FIELDS THE THIRD ATTEMPT- THE GULF SITE AND NOW THIS- PHILLY FOURTH ATTEMPT. NOW WE CERTAINLY DID NOT EVER INTEND TO HAVE FOUR POTENTIAL SITES. AND WE TO MY FRIENDS HERE- WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE THE ARTIST SITE AS THE ORIGINAL SITE AS THAT WAS THE FIRST SITE THAT WAS PROPOSED. BUT FOR SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT- GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH US THERE WERE BALLOT MEASURES THERE WERE. PEOPLE CALL TO SUPPORT- NINE ORIGINAL SITE THERE WERE JUST AS MANY WHO HAD CONCERNS WITH TRAFFIC WITH FUNCTION WAY WITH A SCHOOL SITE WITH HOMEOWNERS SO ALL OF THE SITES DO- IN ESSENCE BRING UP SOME OF THE SAME COMMENTS SO WHETHER IT'S CHIPS AND OR ARDA- BUT- THE REAL- MOVE AWAY FROM IRVINE CAME. FROM THE COUNCIL THE CITY COUNCIL AS WAS MENTIONED VOTING THAT DOWN SEVERAL TIMES AND I KNOW WAS MENTIONED IN OPPOSITION THAT THERE COULD BE A NEW COUNCIL COMING IN NOVEMBER AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE POTENTIAL BUT OUR JOB IS TO SECURE. AS QUICKLY AS- A SPACE. AS YOU HEARD SOME OF THE MEMBERS CALLING ON THE LINES FOR EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS OLD EIGHT FIVE YEAR OLD. AND THE VETERANS WE KNOW BEFORE AND DURING THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD ARE PASSING AWAY AND THAT IS THE URGENCY HERE BUT YES ART IT DOES NOT EXCLUDE. YOU FOR I NOT AND I'M LIKE IT'S JUST OF THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS YOU KNOW- BERTINO AND YOUR OPENING. I DESCRIBED IS A HARD THING THAT YOU HAVE HAD. EVER GRAPPLED WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THIS CAPITAL AND I THINK THAT AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THIS TURNED INTO A POLITICAL HOT POTATO. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS BEEN REALLY SHAMEFUL AND I KNOW INCREDIBLY HURTFUL TO SO MANY OF OUR LOCAL VETERANS WHO SERVED OUR NATION SO SELFLESSLY AND- I DO HOPE AND I DO GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT. THE ONE SAYING THAT SUPPORTERS AND OPPOSITION CAN AGREE ON ABOUT THIS IS THAT ORANGE COUNTY'S VETERANS DESERVE A DEDICATED AND DIGNIFIED RESTING PLACE- THAT BEST FITS THEIR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. AND DIVE EIGHT YOU KNOW APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT- TO HONORING OUR VETERANS AS WELL AND- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUT OUT TAKE THIS TIME TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BOERNER HORVATH DALY HERE MATHIS MURATSUCHI PETRIE-NORRIS HERE SALAS SMITH. CORMS ESTABLISHED THANK YOU WE HAVE- COMMENTS FROM SENATOR MATHIS THEN WE'LL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND IN THANK YOU TO- OUR COLLEAGUE. MISS PETER NORRIS THANK- THE POINTS ON THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OR- VERY SPOT ON. THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING DECADES PLUS LONG CONVERSATION AND- THE- YOU KNOW AND WE WE'VE SEEN BACK AND FORTH EVEN BETWEEN THE AUTHORS ON THIS LEGISLATION BETWEEN MISS QUIRK-SILVA AND MISTER CHOI AND TO SEE THEM COME TOGETHER ON THIS TO SEE. YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE HAPPY. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THINGS AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN GOVERNMENT HAS TO AT THE STATE LEVEL STEP UP AND PLAY THE PART OF BIG BROTHER. AND SAY OKAY WE'RE WE'RE DONE HERE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND IN THIS CASE WE NEED TO HONOR OUR VETERANS. AND GET THIS DONE. AND I WANT TO THANK DR CHOI AND. I'M TRYING TO THINK AND I'M LIKE SHARON- I DON'T THINK THE AUTHORS. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T EASY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE STILL THIS TERM WHILE BACK ON THERE STILL IS A DEBATE BACK HOME AND IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY HEY WE'RE GOING TO PUT A VETERANS CEMETERY AND MIDDLE OF A LARGE URBAN AREA WORK. AND BUT GO AHEAD AND MOTION TO MOVE THISBILL FOR NOW WE OF COURSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT SO THEY WERE DALY. THANK YOU- AND I DO INTEND TO SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT'S- IT'S WELL THOUGHT OUT- SO I SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES. SHARON QUIRK-SILVA THAT IS HER NAME- SUPPORT THIS BILL- AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION TO SUPPORT THE BILL JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO GET A FEW DETAILS ON THE TABLE. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE. TO PREVIOUS STUDIES. OF CEMETERY SITES OF SITES FOR THIS CEMETERY AND I WERE WONDERING I DID NOT SEEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF BEFORE THIS HEARING HOW MUCH MONEY THE STATE HAS SPENT ON THOSE TWO STUDIES. AND I'M RECALLING EACH WAS APPROXIMATELY 400-100-0500 THOUSAND. BALLPARK TO HAVE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT. OKAY THANK YOU YOU'RE GONNA LOOK IT UP. BUT LET'S JUST THOSE ARE BALLPARK NUMBERS THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY SPENT ON STUDIES. AND I'M ALSO WONDERING IS. I KNOW THIS BILL PROPOSES TO STUDY. LIKELY THE GYPSUM CANYON SIDE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT DESIGNATED BUT DO WE HAVE A BALLPARK ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THAT A CEMETERY AT THAT SITE WILL COST. HENCE THE NEED FOR A STUDY BUT THERE'S NO BALLPARK ESTIMATE THERE'S NO OKAY. I KNOW THE COUNTY HAS COMMITTED FUNDING. FOR THE POTENTIAL CEMETERY AT THAT SITE SO I JUST WANT TO FLEISCH THOSE POINTS OUT. AND- IF WE CAN'T OBTAIN UNANSWERED TODAY MAYBE YOU COULD COMMUNICATE TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF. MISTER CHAIR IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO YOU- THE CHAIR WILL GET THE INFORMATION QUÉ YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR RAMOS AND- I INTEND TO SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH VICE CHAIR VOEPEL. YES AS A VETERAN- I'M LOOKING AT THE VALLEY HERE. INTER'S QUITE A FEW- INDIVIDUAL HOUSES. AND THE POSE VETERANS CEMETERY WOULD BE MORE UP THE HILLSIDE. WITH A LINE OF SIGHT NOW THERE IS A BIAS AGAINST CEMETERIES IN GENERAL PEOPLE ARE KIND OF AFRAID OF THEM- I GREW UP. NEAREST CEMETERY AND MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME THE SAFEST PLACE ON THE PLANET IS IN A CEMETERY NO ONE'S GOING TO MESS WITH YOU LITTLE BIT OF PUSH BACK HERE IS JUST SIMPLY. HAVING A CEMETERY IN THE SIGHTLINE ON DO TOMBSTONES SO IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT THE OTHER THING IS TRAFFIC. IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH VETERANS CEMETERIES THE MAIN TRAFFIC WOULD BE ON MEMORIAL DAY. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS EVERYBODY'S OFF ON MEMORIAL DAY SO YOU DON'T HAVE BIG TRAFFIC ISSUES BECAUSE IT'S A HOLIDAY. IN MAINLY THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO A VETERANS CEMETERY ON MEMORIAL DAY OR VETERANS FAMILIES. SO THE TRAFFIC ISSUE IS REALLY A NON STARTER ARE YOU ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRAFFIC AT CHRISTMAS. BECAUSE A LOT OF VETERANS FAMILIES WILL PUT A CHRISTMAS TREE ON A GRAVE. OR REEF AND ENFORCE JULY OF COURSE. SO I AM NOT CONVINCED AT ALL THAT THERE'S A TRAFFIC PROBLEM. IT WITHOUT GETTING TOO LONG WINDED I ALWAYS REMIND PEOPLE. ABOUT VETERANS WE CELEBRATE THREE HOLIDAYS EVERY YEAR. THE FIRST IS ARMED FORCES DAY AS FOR EVERYONE WEARING A UNIFORM. WE HAVE VETERANS DAY FOR EVERYONE WORE THE UNIFORM WE HAVE MEMORIAL DAY FOR ALL THOSE THAT NEVER MADE IT OUT OF UNIFORM THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ANY OTHER- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISHING TO COMMENT. HEARING NONE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU I DID WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE STUDIES AND YES THAT HAS BEEN- A LITTLE TRICKY AT- THERE WERE. THREE SITES PROPOSED IN IRVINE ONE WAS NOT STUDIED THE STRAWBERRY SITE BUT THE GULF SITE AND ARDA- I BELIEVE EACH OF THEM WERE. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO TO A MILLION AND FOR BOTH OF THOSE THIS NEXT ONE- GIPSON CANYON. WE HAVE PUT UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THERE- I HAVE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE COUNTIES- INVESTMENT IN THIS AS FAR AS PUTTING UP MONEY AND NATIONALLY FOR THAT VERSUS CAL THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS- THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH CALVET TO DO THIS STUDY IS THE URGENCY PART OF IT OTHERWISE WE'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND START OVER ON SOME OF THIS. BUT THE CAMERA COUNTY IS PUTTING IN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION THAT NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY AND SENATOR TOM- BURKE- HAVE WERE ABLE TO SECURE WHICH ADDS. IS THAT TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SO AND ASK TO HAVE THE TWENTY MILLION ACCOUNT PLUS THE ADDITIONAL. MONEY THAT IS THERE- THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE WANT TO JUST A ROAD MONEY JUST TO STUDY ANY SITE BUT THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED ACRE SITE- THEY'RE HAVING QUESTIONS WOULD- THIS VETERANS CEMETERY BE COMBINED WITH THE PUBLIC CEMETERY. THEY WILL NOT BE COMBINED THERE WILL BE A SUB PUBLIC CEMETERY- IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THIS- PARCEL OF LAND WITH ITS OWN OPERATING NOT FROM CAL THAT FROM THE WATCH COUNTY CEMETERY DISTRICT. THE ORANGE COUNTY CEMETERY DISTRICT WILL BE PUTTING IN QUITE A BIT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AS FOR AS A ROADS AND OTHER- INVESTMENTS TO GET THIS PROPERTY. YEAH I WOULD SAY AS FAR AS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- THIS PARCEL SITS KIND OF ON A HILLSIDE IN ANAHEIM HILLS AND THERE IS A FREE WAY THAT. DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE PROPERTY BUT THAT RUNS- OUR PARALLEL TO THIS PROPERTY SO THERE ARE NO HOMES DIRECTLY IN THE VICINITY THERE ACTUALLY ACROSS. THE FREEWAY WHICH IS SEVERAL LANES QUITE A BIT DISTANCE AWAY AND THEN LASTLY SOME MYTHS ABOUT THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE- HAVING A CREMATORY THERETHAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NEVER BE ON SITE SO I JUST WANT. TO THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL PROPOSAL- AND URGE ANY OF YOU TO GO OUT TO THIS CHIPS INSIDE I MYSELF PERSONALLY WAS A LITTLE HESITANT AFTER THREE SITES AND IRVINE AND IT REALLY WAS GOING OUT ON THAT IF YOU WANT TO SAY SITE TRIP. THAT DEFINITELY HAD ME CHANGE MY VIEW AND LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY BEAUTIFUL REST. FOR OUR THAT SH. THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THIS BILL ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION BEFORE US IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS BETTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
