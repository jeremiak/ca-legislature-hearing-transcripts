A. B. FORTY FIVE SOMEONE NUMBER GONZALEZ THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB FORTY WOULD REQUIRE SLATE MAILERS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO HELP VOTERS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. IN THIS PAST ELECTION WE ALL HEARD- UNIQUE PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING WITH WHITE MAILERS AND I EVEN BROUGHT. ONE IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR- SHE IS A PROP. THAT WAS SENT TO MY HOME. AND IT WAS FOR US AS ANOTHER CANDIDATE AGAINST MY MER- BUT IF YOU CAN SEE IT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS JUST LIKE A MAIL PIECE- WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS PAYING FOR THE SENATE MAIL PIECE WE USUALLY KNOW. BUT INSTEAD THE SAYS THE VOTER EDUCATION COALITION DEMOCRATS FOR REFORM THE GROUP THAT FROM. FROM WHAT I CAN TELL DOESN'T REALLY EXIST EXCEPT FOR IN AN EFFORT TO DO- WHAT IT IS NOT NO LONGER WHAT USED TO BE A SLIGHT MAIL PIECE NOW LOOKS LIKE A TRADITIONAL MAIL PIECE BUT NOT. DISCLOSE WHO THE FUNDERS ARE. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE STATE MAIL TO INCLUDE HOW MUCH WAS PAID FOR CANDIDATE OR BALLOT MEASURE TO APPEAR ON THE MAILER AND HOW MANY MEMBERS THE SLATE MAIL ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS. SLATE MAIL IS A COMMON SIGHT TO ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA VOTERS. DURING THE ELECTION PROCESS. BUT SOME OF THESE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST IN SOME CASES CANDIDATES LISTED ARE PORTRAYED ON SLATE MAILER MAY NOT SUPPORT THE OTHER POSITIONS TAKEN ON THE MAILER. IN OTHER CASES THE POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT A VOTER MIGHT ASSUME THE SLATE MAILER REPRESENTS MADE ONLINE WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FLIGHT MAILER. AND THIS PAST NOVEMBER THE COPS VOTER GUIDE FOR EXAMPLE SLATE MAILER LISTED AND OPPOSE POSITION ON A PROPOSITION THAT MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WERE ACTUALLY. IN SUPPORT OF IN FACT I THINK ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN SUPPORT OF- BUT THEY RECEIVED A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE PROPOSITIONS UP HOME. OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN AND LISTED IT AS SUCH. I'M DESPITE ITS NAME THE COPS VOTER GUIDE DID NOT ACTUALLY REPRESENT ANY MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. WHILE WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS CURRENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SLATE MAIL STILL OUT FOR LACK OF TRUE TRANSPARENCY AROUND WHO IS SENDING THE SLATE MAIL AND WEISSERT CANDIDATES ARE BALLOT MEASURES ARE INCLUDED. THIS CAN LEAD VOTERS TO BE DECEIVED ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE POSITIONS TAKEN AB FORTY WOULD REQUIRE THAT EACH CANDIDATE OR BALLOT MEASURE THAT. IS PAID TO APPEAR ON THE MAILER. THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BE DISCLOSED DIRECTLY BELOW THE NAME OR MEASURE NAME AND POSITION. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS REPRESENT BY SLATE MAIL ORGANIZATION OR COMMITTEE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NOTICE TO VOTERS. IN CASES WHERE THE FLIGHT NOW REASONABLY APPEARS TO REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION GROUP OR CLASS OF PEOPLE. SUCH AS TEACHERS ARE VETERANS THE BILL WOULD SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS. AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE ORGANIZATION GROUP OR CLASS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. THESE CRITERIA. YET SUCH AS BEING ABLE TO VOTE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ARE PAYING DUES. AND THE REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR SLATE MAIL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. THE THAT DISCLOSURES WILL HELP BETTER INFORM. VOTERS ON THE ENTITY SPEAKING THROUGH THIS WHITE MALE WHO'S PAYING FOR IT WHO STANDS TO BENEFIT. AND I'D HELP PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS ON ELECTION DAY. I HAVE NO WITNESSES. BUT I RESPECTFULLY AS FOR AND I ABOUT. I THINK. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- THERE THERE ARE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SO WE WILL. MOVE ON TO THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AS A REMINDER EACH PRIMARY WITNESS HAS A MAXIMUM OF THREE MINUTES YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ALL THREE MINUTES- AND I BELIEVE OUR FIRST PRIMARY WITNESS- WELL OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES OPPOSITION EARLIER LEVINE. OR LEVINE. AND GABRIEL FOR A WHILE NOW. WHO ARE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE SO FOR THOSE FOLKS ARE ONLINE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU ARE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME IS LARRY LEVINE. I APPEARED IN OPPOSITION TO AB HOLIDAY. THE ISSUE REYES BUT THIS BILL HAS BEEN LITIGATED BEFORE AND WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL A JUDGE LAWRENCE CALLED HIM. IN A LAWSUIT CONTESTED IN FEDERAL COURT IN SACRAMENTO. YEAH LEVINE B. THREE OUR CALIFORNIA STATE ATTEMPTED TO COMPEL THE PRINTING OF DOLLAR SIGNS NEXT TO THE NAMES OF CANDIDATES AND BALLOT MEASURES THAT CHOSE TO ADVERTISE ON SLATE MAIL. JUDGE CARLTON FOUND THAT STRAIGHT MALE IS NO MORE CORRUPTED. MORE COLLECTIBLE THAN. OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL FIGURE. A LOT. OF LICENSE OF CORRUPTION THE REMEDY WE NEED TO BE A LEASE WISH NAY. THE G. YOU HAVE THAT TO COMPEL SPEECH OF COURSE DOWN SOMEONE'S HIS NOT THE BUILDINGS RESTRICT. AND IN FACT- WE WOULD CALL CAST A NEGATIVE LIGHT ON THE MAILER. IN ADDITION COURT. THE REQUIRE EXCEEDED THE STATE'S LEGITIMATE NEED FOR DISCLOSURE AND THAT THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS OF MASTERS ALONG WITH EXISTING DISCLAIMERS AND FILING FINANCE REPORTS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STATE'S NEED. CALL CAN ALSO TURN ON THAT SINGLING OUT MALE AMONG ALL OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION IS PROOF OF ANIMUS AND THAT BY ITSELF. SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO ENJOY. AB FORTY REPEAT SAID ANALYST BY APPLYING ITS REQUIREMENTS ONLY TWO SLATES AND NOT TO ANY OTHER FORM OF POLITICAL COMMITTEE DRUG COMMUNICATION. I WANTED. ARE YOU ARE YOU STILL THERE MICHELIN. OKAY WELL MOVE ON I'M IS GONNA END OF MISS LIVING COMES BACK HE'LL HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE- TO FINISH HIS TESTIMONY BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE LOST AND- SURE GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME MR I CAN. OKAY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS GOT IT WHETHER I'M A TRUSTEE OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND WILL BE A CANDIDATE FOR REELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THERE ARE THREE MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS-IN OUR COLLEGE DISTRICT AS A CANDIDATE I LEARNED IT WOULD COST MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND THE CENTERPIECE OF CAMPAIGN MAIL TO THE HOME OF EVERYBODY TEACHER VOTER IN THE DISTRICT. ELLIE TO ATTEND WITH ME COLLEGES TRICK THAT'S MORE THAN THE COMBINED AMOUNT RAISED BY ALL FORTY DOUBLE CANDIDATE FOR TRUSTEE IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. IT IS EVEN WORSE FOR JUDICIAL CANDIDATE AND THAT LAKE COUNTY WITH THERE ARE FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS THE COP THE MAILING TO EACH OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD WHICH EQUIPS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. GIVEN THE IN THE MAIL THESE NUMBERS PLATE MAIL BECOME AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT INGREDIENTS IN OUR CAMPAIGN. THE SAME IS TRUE OF LARGE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE A COUNTY WIDE JUDICIAL RICH JUDICIAL RACES BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PARK DISTRICT TRANSIT DISTRICT SCHOOL BOND MEASURE THAT AFFECTS FOR THE REQUIREMENT OF EIGHTY FORTY WOULD DEPRIVE ME AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER CANDIDATE OF THE USE THE PLATE MAIL AS A COST EFFECTIVE MEANS BY WHICH WE COMMUNICATE WITH VOTERS. THE INCLUSION OF DOLLAR AMOUNT NO MATTER HOW NOMINAL IN AND OF ITSELF WOULD BE BUT WHAT BY VOTERS AGAIN THAT I BELIEVED THAT FLORENCE CARLTON MADE THAT DETERMINATION ENJOINING ENFORCEMENT UP TO PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE THE SAME KIND OF REQUIREMENT MONTHLY MAIL HE FOUND THE CURRENT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ADEQUATE TO SERVE THE STATE. INTEREST I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO DEFEAT EIGHTY FORTY AND PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THIS VITAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATING WITH VOTERS THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD DAY THANK YOU. MR RANA AND- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WHEN THIS INTO. OR ON. TO IT FORTY AS A REMINDER DO TIME OF.

UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THERE A LOT OF THINGS IN POLITICS I CANNOT STAND- BUT- I. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE A. BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED INTO THIS ALSO OF TRYING TO LIMIT WHAT THEY CAN DO. IS SEEMS TO BE A BLOCK WALL AND- AND I'M I'M CURIOUS WHEN YOU WERE DEVELOPING THIS- WHAT KIND OF CONST WHAT DID YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER ABOUT WHICH WE IS DOES SO SOME GUY DRESSED WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH PLEDGE COUNCIL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN COUNT LIKE MR LEVINE WAS TALKING ABOUT A CASE FROM TWO THOUSAND TO THE CIRCUMVENTING CASE IN BETWEEN THAT WAS CITIZENS UNITED AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT MORE. RECENT CASES IN FACT THE LANDSLIDE COMMUNICATIONS CASE WHICH SHOULD BE CONTROLLING NOW IT'S COME AFTER THE SUPREME COURT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF BECAUSE THEY BASICALLY SAID LIKE LOOK CITIZENS UNITED SAID THIS IS ALL- TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD IN THIS IS IN THAT WAS IN A SLATE MAIL CASE SO WE THINK- AND GIVEN WHAT LEAD COUNSEL- WENT THROUGH WITH IT. THE INTERVENING CASES SINCE SOME OF THESE WERE INITIALLY DECIDED. WOULD- WOULD BE CONTROLLING. I THANK YOU. ARE YOU GUYS STILL DOES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DELVING INTO. THIS HORNETS NEST THAT IS SLATE MAILERS- SO THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU. THERE IS A SERVER MS RUBIO YES WOULD JUST FOR CLARIFICATION WE'RE NOT ELIMINATING THE FLEET MAILERS YOU'RE JUST REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I COULD DO FOR AYE EASE FOR EXAMPLE AND INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES NOW REQUIRE CERTAIN FONT AND TO DISCLOSE WHO IS PAYING FOR THEM SO IS THAT BOTH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING THEY WERE DOING WITH THE SLATE MAILERS EXACTLY GIVING- THE VOTERS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR IT WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. M. AND SO THAT THEY'RE NOT EASILY FOLDS BY- I NAME RIGHT WELL I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE FINGERTIPS OF WHO'S PAYING FOR WHAT YOU GET IN A NORMAL BRIGHT AND CLEAN WELL AND JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS WHAT MADE THAT THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE DALY COMMITTEE COLLEGE- AND SOME OF THE JUDGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADVERTISE THAT ABILITY STILL GOING TO BE THERE THIS IS JUST MORE DISCLOSURE AND THE AND THE- VOTER RIGHTS.

IT SHOULDN'T TAKE COMPOUND IT CRISES AND POLITICAL PANIC TO REACH SUCH A HIGH TURNOUT DECLARING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY IS NOT A PANICCIA BUT IT WILL COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE POLLS. AB FIFTY THREE WILL FREE APARTMENT HERE TO WORK THE POLE AND TO BE POLL OBSERVER SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND IT KIND OF COORDINATED MISINFORMATION.

OUR SPONSOR AB FOR THIRTY. AB FIFTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY FOR STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTIONS IN LIEU OF WASH DAY- FOR CENTURIES. ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL PART OF OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY YET VOTER TURNOUT HAS FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR VOTERS ONE OF THE LARGEST BARRIER TO GETTING TO THE POLLS HAVE BEEN THE FACT THAT LECTURES ARE HELD DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY. AND EVEN THOUGH AND EVEN THOUGH MANY HAVE TO JUGGLE RESPONSIBILITIES AT WRK AND AT HOME. AB FIFTY THREE SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOT ONLY IN RECOGNITION OF HOW IMPORTANT ELECTIONS ARE BUT ALSO EXPANDING ACCESS ACCESSIBILITY OF BOATING ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO WORK IN FLEXIBLE VOTING- IMPOSSIBLE HOURS. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STUDENTS THIS BILL CRITICAL. SALVAGING ELECTION DAY OF THE HOLIDAY WOULD OPEN UP SCHOOL FACILITIES OTHER EXCEPTIONAL COMUNITY COLLEGE POLLING STATIONS. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE RESTRICTED IF SCHOOL IS IN SESSION. FURTHERMORE TAKING THE DAY OFF- INS FROM CLASS SPARKED IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS IN THE CLASSROOM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT WHY WE RECOGNIZE AND PROVIDE SPACE FOR STUDENTS TO DO THEIR CIVIC DUTY AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. INSTEAD OF SENDING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL PARENTS CAN TAKE THEIR KIDS WITH THEM O VOTE NOT THE SCHOOL SITE AND TAKE THE DAY OFF TO WATCH THEIR DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. AT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO FIND NEW WAYS TO GET INVOLVED CIVICALLY. INCLUDING BECOMING A POLL WORKER WHICH IS ASSISTING VOTERS IN ACCESSING FILLING OUT THEIR BALLOTS. ENSURING A FAIR ACCOUNT AND BEING PART OF THE LIFE BLOOD OF OUR DEMOCRACY. YEAH FIVE MANY OF MY PEERS. IN THE SCHOOL IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. MAKING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY WOULD OPEN UP THE SCHEDULE OF MANY MORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO VOLUNTEER OF POLL WORKERS- GETTING CIVICALLY ENGAGED. AND PREPARING THEM TO BE FUTURE VOTERS BOB THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS WE TALK ABOUT OPENING UP NEW POLLING STATIONS WITH GREATER- CAPACITY- FOR STUDENTS TO- WORKERS COWORKERS. YOUNG PEOPLE ALSO IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THE PARTICIPATION OF ELECTION DAY WAS A HOLIDAY. AT THE AGE GROUP OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE IS STILL CURRENTLY SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPRESENTED AT THE BALLOT BOX. THE NUMBER OF FIRST TIME VOTERS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE WOULD SKYROCKET IN RESPONSE TO THIS BILL. AND THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR VOTING IS A VERY A **** WILL PROCESS.

I WOULD LIKE TO NOW BRING IT BACK TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS OR SECONDS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO MOTIONS OR SECONDS. GOT A MOTION GOT A SECOND COMMENTS PLEASE WRITE YOUR QUESTION. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH BALLOTS ARE GOING TO BE MAIL IN BALLOTS AND THEY'RE GONNA BE MAILED OUT ABOUT THIRTY DAYS BEFORE ELECTION IN WHICH DAY WE HAVE THIRTY DAYS OF WHICH TO FILL OUT OUR BALLOT AND MAIL AGAIN. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE HARD CORE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO VOTE. IN PERSON. AND TO ACCOMMODATE THAT- WE HAVE VOTING IN PERSON THE FIRST FOUR DAYS JUST PRIOR TO ELECTION WHICH INCLUDES A WEEKEND SO MANY STUDENTS THAT WANT TO. ENGAGE IN THE POLL WORKING PROCESS. HAVE A SATURDAY AND A SUNDAY THOSE ARE ALREADY DAYS OFF. TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT. IF WE ARE TO ADD ANOTHER HOLIDAY WHICH BY THE WAY SHOULD BE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THING FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHENEVER YOU'RE ADDING OR TAKING AWAY HOLIDAYS ESPECIALLY PAID HOLIDAYS. THOSE ARE SOMETHING THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINED FOR- SO DOES DOES GET OUT AGAIN. THIS IS NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT THAT COSTS TAXPAYERS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING IF THIS WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO- I MIGHT VOTE FOR THIS EVEN THOUGH I WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BECAUSE WHEN I WORKED ON TUESDAY I WORK ON TUESDAY. AND IN THEIR WAYS AND FOR ME TO VOTE AND I'VE NEVER NEVER MISSED ABOUT. SO I KEEP. LIKE I SAID I THINK TODAY'S WORLD THIS IS UNNECESSARY. WE KNOW OUR ELECTIONS ARE GOING EVERYBODY WILL HAVE A PARK IF EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THE- MORE THAN THE ABILITY TO VOTE IF THEY WANT TO VOTE. AND THERE IS NO VOTER SUPPRESSION IF WE DON'T HAVE A DAY OFF ON TUESDAY. AND THIS COST TAXPAYERS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DID DID YET PAY OUT ANOTHER PAID HOLIDAY. FOR THEM- SO- I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT HAD LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER IT BECAUSE- YEAH PEOPLE COULD VOTE THEN. THANKS. THEME IS RIGHT- IS A MEASURE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE MISTER LOWE WOULD LIKE A QUOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I SUPPORT SIMILAR BILLS BY THIS AUTHOR IN THE LAST TWO SESSIONS AND ALL COMMENDED ON HIS COMMITMENT TO TAKING STEPS TO MAKE OUR ELECTIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO VOTERS. THE STATE HAS ALREADY TAKEN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STUFF THE FACILITY PARTICIPATION BY VOTERS WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFICULTY MAKING IT TO THE POLLING PLACE ON ELECTION DAY AND THIS BILL SIMILARLY SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT WORK AND SCHOOL CONFLICTS ARE NOT BARRIERS. TO VOTER PARTICIPATION SO I AM RECOMMENDING SUPPORT MANAGER- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS IN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION BERMAN HI BERMAN THEY SAY AUTO NO SE ARCH- NO BENNETT. BENNETT HELLO I LOW HI MAIN. MULLIN BLANCA RUBIO BLANCA RUBIO I. THE VOTE IS FOUR TO ONE AT THAT BILL IS WILL KEEP THE OKAY FOR AN- MEMBERS- DO WE HAVE ANY. WE WILL WAIT.

REALLY AUTHORS ANY AUTHORS WE'RE LOOKING FOR- MISTER MULLIN AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR MR KILEY. I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LOOKING FOR THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR. MR KILEY LOOK AT THAT AS IF ON CUE THANK YOU SIR. SO THEN THE FIND MY PLACE IN THE SCRIPT- ROTH. FIFTY FIFTY. SO THE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO I BELIEVE THIS IS THE THIRD TO THE FOURTH ITEM ON THE AGENDA AB EIGHT SEVENTY ONE BY SOMEONE OR KILEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR- IN EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN FEDERAL JUDGE WILLIAM ALSUP SAID THAT THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CUT PATTERN HERE- THAT PG&amp;E IS STARTING THESE FIRES WHAT DO WE DO THAT THE JUDGE JUST TURN A BLIND EYE AND SAY PG&amp;E CONTINUE YOUR BUSINESS AS USUAL. AROUND THAT TIME A WALL STREET JOURNAL INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT PG&amp;E CORPORATION KNEW FOR YEARS THAT HUNDREDS OF MILES OF HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINES COULD FAIL AND SPARK FIRES YET REPEATEDLY FAILED TO PERFORM THE NECESSARY UPGRADES. THE NEW YORK TIMES STORY AROUND THAT TIME IDENTIFIED AN UNDERLYING CAUSE IN A STORY HEADLINED AT THE POLITICAL PLAYBOOK OF A BANKRUPT CALIFORNIA UTILITY. THE TIMES REPORTED THE DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT THE COMPANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REPEATED SAFETY VIOLATIONS INVOLVED IN DEADLY WILDFIRES WELL MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM POLITICAL DONATIONS FROM THE COMPANY. THE TIMES CONTINUED PERHAPS NO COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA IS MORE ENTANGLED WITH LOCAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICS THAN PG&amp;E HELLO I WOULD NOT OF INCLUDED THE- THE PARTISAN- QUALIFIER. AND- IT CONTINUED THE CRITICS SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN A CULTURE OF CRONYISM BETWEEN REGULATORS. AND THE AND THE REGULATED. A SUPERVISOR AARON PESKIN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SAID THAT THE THAT PG&amp;E IS TREMENDOUS POLITICAL INFLUENCE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL HAS LED THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ABOVE SCRUTINY AND REPROACH. IF THE GAS ELECTRIC SPEND AS MUCH TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT RUNNING THE GAS AND ELECTRIC FACILITIES AS THEY DID ON POLITICS THEY WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS RIGHT NOW. AS ONE EXAMPLE AFTER THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLOSION- SENATOR JERRY HILL. CALLED ON THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS- TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL COOPERATION BETWEEN PG&amp;E. AND REGULATORS AND- SENATOR HILL SAID THE RESPONSE WE GOT WAS THANKS FOR THE LETTER GO AWAY. FOLLOWING THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILLIE BROWN SAID HE WAS PAID BY PG&amp;E TO PERSONALLY DELIVER A MESSAGE TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM ADDING I HOPE THEY CALL ME BECAUSE EVERY CALL. GENERATES AN INVOICE NOW NONE OF THIS OF COURSE IS UNIQUE TO PG&amp;E. OR TO UTILITIES. IT'S JUST THE CULTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA CAPITAL QUITE FRANKLY. WHAT IS UNIQUE HOWEVER IS THE UNIQUELY INTERTWINED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UTILITIES AND OUR GOVERNMENT I WHICH IS SUCH AS TO. SERVE AS- A COMPELLING INTEREST. IN COMBAT AND WHAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS HELD TO BE A LEGITIMATE JUSTIFICATION FOR RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL DONATIONS- WHICH IS TO STOP A QUID PRO QUO POLITICAL CORRUPTION. SO THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY- SIMPLY I HAS A NARROWLY TAILORED INTERVENTIONS. IT IT IN ORDER TO SERVE THAT COMPELLING INTEREST IT EXTENDS THE EXISTING BAR ARE ON PUBLIC UTILITIES FROM MAKING POLITICAL DONATIONS. TO UTILITIES THAT ARE BECAUSE I PUBLIC OR THAT ARE NOMINALLY INVESTOR OWNED% BUT THAT RETAIN MANY OF THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF STATE POWER. SUCH AS- MINUTE MAINTAINING MONOPOLIES ON ENTIRE REGIONS SEIZING PROPERTY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN AND ENJOYING A FIXED RATE OF RETURN STATE OFFICIALS IN TURN. ARE ESSENTIALLY EMBEDDED IN THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE OFFICIALS CLOSELY MONITOR CLOSELY CONTROL PRICES OPERATIONS AND PURCHASING THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP UNLIKE ANY OTHER WITH A NOMINALLY PRIVATE ENTITY NOW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RAISES. SOME FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS APPROPRIATELY- THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHENEER YOU HAVE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL ORAL ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT OR EXPRESSION. OF ANY KIND AND I TAKE THAT PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY I'VE AUTHORED LEGISLATION SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATION HERE TO ADVANCE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES I'M AN AUTHOR OF A CO AUTHOR OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR- TO ADVANCE FREE SPEECH. ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS NOTHING IS MORE VITAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAN ROBUST PROTECTIONS FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH BUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT AFFORD ABSOLUTE PROTECTION THE POLITICAL DONATIONS. THE CONTROVERSIAL CITIZENS UNITED DECISION BY THE US SUPREME COURT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN DOES NOT COVER CONTRIBUTIONS. TO CANDIDATES AS OR AT LEAST IS NOT A PUT UP A STRIP. BAR TO- TO REGULATING THEM ADDING MONEY TO A CAMPAIGN BANKING THIS COURT OF HELD IS LESS OF AN- ACTIVITY. BEEN USING THAT MONEY TO ADVANCE ONE'S OWN MESSAGE INDEED CALIFORNIA ALREADY DISQUALIFIED SEVERAL TYPES OF ENTITIES. FROM POLITICAL GIVING EVEN AS THEY ENGAGE IN OTHER FORMS OF ADVOCACY SO LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE A PUBLIC ENTITY LIKE A CITY OR EVEN A PUBLIC UTILITY LIKES MUD. ARE THEY CAN HAVE A LOBBYIST AT THE CAPITOL BUT THEY CAN'T GIVE MONEY TO CAMPAIGNS AND SAME GOES FOR NONPROFITS AND CONGRESS AND OTHER STATES GO FURTHER. BANNING CONTRIBUTIONS BY ALL CORPORATIONS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS NATIONAL BANKS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS. SEVERAL STATES INCLUDING MISSISSIPPI ALABAMA AND GEORGIA SPECIFICALLY BAR UTILITIES FROM DONATING TO CANDIDATES FOR ELECTED PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T ELECTED PC COMMISSIONERS SO INEQUIVALENT RESTRICTION HAS TO BE AIMED AT THE ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR APPOINTMENT. AND CONFIRMATION WHICH IS TO SAY THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATORS AND EVEN MISTER MISTER GUY HOW ARE WE GETTING CLOSE TO A CLOSE- YEAH I GOT MAYBE. ANOTHER MINUTE LEFT OKAY. EVEN PG&amp;E IS OWN OPPOSITION WATER. MAKES THIS POINT IT SAYS THAT WHILE THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT AFFORD ABSOLUTE PROTECTION TO POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. COURTS HAVE DEMANDED THAT LAWS SINGLING OUT AN INDUSTRY BE NARROWLY TAILORED FOR EXAMPLE TO INCLUDE CANDIDATES FOR POSITIONS. THAT ACTUALLY REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTOR. AND THAT'S US THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S THE GOVERNOR WE DO NOT HAVE AN ELECTED PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO APPOINTS THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE SENATE WHO CONFIRMS THEM. OUR LEGISLATURE HAS COMMITTEES LIKE THE UTILITY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE- AND WE VOTE ON LEGISLATION THAT GIVES THE UC ORDERS AND COVERS THE SCOPE OF WHAT IT DOES SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS HERE- OUGHT TO HOLD BACK THIS. LEGISLATION AND ULTIMATELY BORING UTILITY CONTRIBUTIONS IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR THE SAME REASON IT IS LEGISLATIVELY ADVISABLE UTILITY IS SO JOINED AT THE HIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THE RISK OF UNDUE INFLUENCE. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD AT ALL KERR AND THE HEART OF WHAT IT DOES IS INTOLERABLE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AS A WITNESS TODAY ON THE PHONE LINE I HAVE TRENT LAYING IT WHO IS WITH THE CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER MY SISTER. WHILE I RUN DOWN AND VOTE. COMMITTEE WHICH IS WRAPPING UP AND THEN I'LL BE RIGHT BACK BUT WE ARE IN GOOD HANDS THANK YOU I THANK YOU MR KILEY WE HAVE HERE A WITNESS TESTIMONY- GO AHEAD. YES- GOOD MORNING AT YOUR VICE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS TIME TRAVELING PRESENT IN THE CALIFORNIA COULD MONEY CAMPAIGN. I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL- THE HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN I CAP RATES FOR THEIR CAMPAIGNS MUCH OF IT FROM VERY LARGE DONORS IS A CONCERN OF OURS AND- ALMOST. ALL CALIFORNIANS. HOWEVER OF THE FAIRNESS WE DON'T NORMALLY WEIGH IN ON VANCE ON CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ONE SPECIFIC TYPE OF ENTITY OR ANOTHER. HOWEVER AS ALSO POINT OUT PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE ALREADY BANNED FROM MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES DUE TO THEIR SPECIAL NATURE. WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS AND GAS CORPORATIONS REPRESENT A SIMILAR SPECIAL CASE. BECAUSE THEY ENJOY A STATE SANCTIONED MONOPOLIES ON ENTIRE REGIONS THAT ARE UNDER STATE REGULATION AND CONTROL OVER THEIR PRICES OPERATIONS AND PURCHASES. ALL OF WHICH MAKES THE APPEARANCE OF POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THEM PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO PUBLIC PERCEPTION. OF. THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR OVERSIGHT. A JUST AS THE- ON OTHER TYPES OF. CALIFORNIANS HAVE BIRCHLEY NO CHOICE WHETHER TO PATRONIZE THEIR LEXICAL AND GAS CORPORATION. WHY WE THINK THERE MAY BE GOOD REASON TO LIMIT ALL TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NON INDIVIDUALS. PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST CHOOSE NOT TO PATRONIZE THE CORPORATION THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CAN MAKE THAT THEY DON'T LIKE. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE THE MONEY THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO STATE SANCTIONED MONOPOLIES OF THE GAS AND ELECTRICAL COMPANIES IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB EIGHT SEVENTY ONE AND RESPECT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVER THANK YOU. THANK I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY MORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SO WE HAVE A ONE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SHAUB SHAUB MUHAMMAD. FROM THE ACCOUNTS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS- ARE YOU ON. YES I AM GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU RESPECTED SURE MEMBER RUNNING SHORT MUHAMMAD IS BETTER WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB EIGHT SEVENTY ONE- EXCLUDING ALL COMPANIES IN THE SECTOR FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IT IS NOT A MEASURE TO OUR FACTORY THE LESIONS OF THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL. INTO ADDRESS AB EIGHT SEVEN ONE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE DENIES ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATIONS THE RIGHT TO MAKE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE POLITICAL PROCESS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE THIS LIMITED WAY THAT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE RATE THAT TANGIBLE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES- BY DENYING THE CORPORATIONS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES FOR STATE OFFICE. AND FURTHER BUDGET AGAINST THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE BY CREATING A GOVERNMENT PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT ALLOW SPEECH BY SADDAM BUT THE NINE SPEECH FROM OTHERS. AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE ALSO SUPPORT FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATION BESIDES NO COMPELLING STATE INTEREST THAT JUSTIFIES THE OUTRIGHT BAN ON THESE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CLASS OF ENTITIES BUT WITHOUT NO WITHOUT A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST TO DEMONSTRATE HOW GOVERNMENT THAT ON POLITICAL SPEECH WITH CERTAIN GROUP ONE INDIVIDUAL COMPANY PUT THE PERFORMANCE OR BETTER SERVE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN GENERAL. ON THE CONTRARY POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATION TO HELP PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF COULD CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES AND OF COURSE SHALL WHAT SHAREHOLDERS BY SUPPORTING POLITICAL CANDIDATES TO SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY AND THE COMPLEXITY THEM PORTABILITY ISSUES INCLUDING WHILE BY MEDICATION INTEGRATION OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOURCES- AND TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. ELECTRIC AND GAS COMPANIES ARE ON THE FRONT OF THE MISSION THEY KNOW THIS INDUSTRY THAT THEY LEAVE THE DISHES EVERY DAY AND OF COURSE IT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THEIR STAKEHOLDERS CUSTOMERS AND FOLKS ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR WITH THEIR SERVICES. THIS BILL WILL SILENCE THE SPORTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS RESULTING IN AN UNEVEN NON INCLUSIVE POLITICAL PLAYING FIELD THAT AGAIN SILENCE OF THE VOICE OF SOME PEOPLE AND ALLOWS ALLOWS VOICES FROM OTHERS A POLICE REASONS WE MUST GOT INTO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB.

BY WHICH VOTE BY MAIL GUYS AND COUNTY VOTER INFORMATION GUIDES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MAILED OUT TO VOTERS. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THE COUNTY VOTER INFORMATION GUIDES BE MAILED OUT TO REGISTERED VOTERS NO LATER THAN TWENTY ONE DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY. WELL THE ACTUAL VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE TO BE MAILED OUT TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION. WITH MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTORATE CHOOSING TO VOTE BY MAIL OVER TWENTY TWENTY WERE V. VIA BALLOTS IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE JUST VOTERS HAVE ACCESS TO. CRUCIAL BALLOT INFORMATION BEFORE THEY CAST THEIR VOTE. AS AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS CHOOSE VOTE BY MAIL THERE'S A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON EARLY VOTING ELECTION DAY HAS BECOME ELECTION SEASON AS VOTERS RETURN VIA BALLOTS JUST DAYS. AFTER RECEIVING VIA MAIL. WITH THIS IN MIND IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE NONPARTISAN INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND IN THE HANDS OF REGISTERED VOTERS BEFORE THEY GO TO FILL OUT THOSE BALLOTS. ALTHOUGH THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH AND GET FEEDBACK FROM THE CLERKS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING THIS TWO TIME LINES. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS COMMONSENSE FIX BOB THIS MAY FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF AUTHOR PET PEEVE. BUT IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO ME HIGH INCENTIVE COUNTY HAVING RECEIVED MY VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE AFTER I RECEIVE MY BALLOT. THOSE BALLOTS STATEMENTS WE ALL KNOW COST MONEY. WE OUGHT TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL OF THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO THE VOTERS AND TO THE VOTERS THEMSELVES WHO SHOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT. OF THIS INFORMATION BEFORE THE CAST. A BALLOT AND ASPIRIN I BUILT. GOT TO MOST. AND A SECOND. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MOLAN.

YES THANK% YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ALL TO GET BY THANK YOU NICKEL BACKER OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FORMERLY OF ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHEN TO BY THE WAY FOR HER WORK AND CONTRIBUTIONS ON THIS BILL AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED DID COMMENT SIX OF THE ANALYSIS AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN SEEKS TO EXPAND. OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION IN CALIFORNIA SHIFTING VOTER REGISTRATION FROM AN OPT INTO AN OPT OUT APPROACH OTHERWISE REFERRED TO AS AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION HOLDS IMMENSE PROMISE FOR INCREASING VOTER REGISTRATION RATES. AND IMPROVING OVERALL CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA WAS A SECOND STATE IN THE US TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM FOR AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE NEW MOTOR VOTERACT IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING SERVICES TO THE DMV ARE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED TO VOTE. UNLESS THEY OPTED OUT PROGRAMS FOR AB ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE NATION OF LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN VOTER REGISTRATION RATES ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT- INCREASES THE NUMBER THAT I SAW EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF CALIFORNIA CVR EFFORTS WILL HELP REACH ELIGIBLE. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO THE DMV DOES NOT ALREADY THIS BILL SIMPLY ASKS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE CONDUCTED STUDY. BUT EXISTING PRO AND EFFORTS. FOR VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORTS INCLUDING AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION AS WELL AS IDENTIFY OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INCORPORATE AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORTS. INTO THEIR EXISTING OPERATIONS WHILE ALSO PROTECTING. NON CITIZENS FROM MISTAKEN REGISTRATION. IN DOING THIS AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN TAKES THE FIRST STEP IN AUGMENTING. AUGMENTING OUR AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION CALIFORNIA WITH ME ON THE PHONE MELISSA ROMERO OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AS WELL AS MARIAN SCHNEIDER WITH THE BRENNAN CENTER. FOR JUSTICE. GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO FIRST TO MARIAN SCHNEIDER FROM THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE. THANK YOU CARE BERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. I'M AN ADVISER TO THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AT NYU. THE RENDON CENTER THE NONPARTISAN PUBLIC POLICY IN MALL INSTITUTE THAT WORKS TO REFORM REVITALIZED AND DEFEND OUR COUNTRY SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY AND JUSTICE. BRENNAN CENTER SUPPORT SB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST AB ARE WORKS OF BRANDON BROWNER STUDY FOUND THAT VOTER REGISTRATIONS INCREASED BY TWENTY SIX POINT 8% COMPARED TO BEFORE AB ARE AT THE CALIFORNIA DMV. AND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION PROJECT AB ARE REDUCE THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF VOTER REGISTRATION SHOWING A STEADY INCREASE IN REGISTRATIONS AFTER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTION. RATHER THAN A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF AS WAS TYPICAL BEFORE APR. SECOND NOT EVERY CALIFORNIAN INTERACTS WITH THE DMV. AS OF THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TO BE HAVE BEEN REPORTED THAT IT CONDUCTED EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION DRIVER'S LICENSE AND ID TRANSACTIONS. FOR ALL USERS CITIZENS AND NONCITIZENS ALIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS ONLY DEAL WITH THE B. AND B. ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS THAT WOULD BE ALL. OTHER VOTER REGISTRATION AGENCIES SEARCH SIMILARLY LARGE NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS. FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SERVED EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ANNUALLY. AB ARE NEEDS TO REACH A MORE DIVERSE POPULOUS THAT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. IN TWENTY TWENTY BARELY SIXTY THOUSAND VOTERS WERE REGISTERED IN ALL OF THE OTHER NON D. N. B. MOTOR REGISTRATION AGENCIES AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND VOTERS REGISTERED. AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WILL HELP REGISTER MORE VOTERS OF THOSE AGENCIES. THIRD AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WISELY REQUIRES CAREFUL STUDY AROUND THE SECURITY OF DATA TRANSFER AND PROTECTING NONCITIZENS FROM IN A CERTAIN REGISTRATION. ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU AND THE MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ALMOST ELEVEN MILLION FOREIGN BORN IMMIGRANTS. 53% ABOUT FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ARE NATURALIZED CITIZENS. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER OF THE REMAINING. IMMIGRANTS ABOUT HALF ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS AND A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF ARE UNDER. APPROXIMATELY 2212% OF. SPEAK NOW IN. GIVEN THE THAT THEY IT IS. THAT THE NAY AND I. TO ASK OUT OF BIRTH. IS CLEAR. OFFERED MULTIPLE CLIENTS THAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE AND YOU. AN ATTEMPT TO EMPHASIZE. THIS REQUIRES PRIORITIZING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR USERS ALSO AGENCIES MUST INCLUDE AUTOMATIC FILTERS THAT PREVENT THE TRANSFER VOTER REGISTRATION. WHICH ABOUT THE VOTE. FINALLY IN THE NATIONAL CONTACT WITH NO SECRET THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT COME IN A VACUUM BUT RATHER AT A TIME OF GREAT STRAIN TO OUR DEMOCRACY. RENDON CENTER IS TRACKING THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE BUILT IN FORTY SEVEN STATES THAT WOULD RESTRICT VOTING RIGHTS AND MARKLEEVILLE BURDENS TO VOTER REGISTRATION CURTAIL THE ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE EARLY OR MAIL IN THEIR BALLOTS. ALL THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WAS FRAUDULENT. IN THAT SENSE IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ADVANCE MEASURES THAT STRENGTHEN OUR DEMOCRACY AND ENCOURAGED VOTER PARTICIPATION. THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN WICKETS CALIFORNIA AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT FORTH A STRONGER MODEL FOR INCLUSIVE AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION THANK YOU ONE THAT EMBRACES A MORE DIVERSE SET OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS THE GODDESS OF WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO INTERACT WITH THE STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SNYDER MOVING ON TO MS ROMERO- MANY OF THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR. OF THE COMMITTEE.

THANK THE BILL AND PROTECTING DEMOCRACY AND ONCE AGAIN HAVE AN UPPER TO A MASS LEADER PASSING POLICY TO RADICALLY EXPAND ELECTRIC BIKES IN THE AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION MORE AGENCIES. HISTORIC VOTER TURNOUT NUMBERS AND NUMBER TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION CAUGHT MANY OF THE CELEBRITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE EARLY VOTER TURNOUT NUMBERS BUT THAT WASN'T THE FULL STORY. 80% OF REGISTERED VOTER TURNOUT WENT DIRECTLY HIGH THE CONTEXT OF THE FACT THAT THE WORLD ELIGIBLE VOTER TURNOUT WITH ONLY SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. WE HAVE THE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND YOUNG PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC COMPARED TO THEIR SHARE OF THE OVERALL ELIGIBLE VOTER POPULATION. AND ACCORDING TO RESEARCH RELEASED THIS YEAR BY THE PREFERRED BECAUSE OF THE MODESTY. FARED VOTER PARTICIPATION ACTUALLY GREW IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOR WORKING OUT AN ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL POPULATION. AND IN PART AGE AND RACE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND VOTER TURNOUT HAPPY WITH DISTRACTION RATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATURE HAD PUT THE TIME AND AGAIN. BUT POLICIES AIMED AT. TO EXPAND ELECTRIC PRIORITIZE UNDER A- GREW CONTINUE TO BE THE COLOR IN THE TOP RIGHT. I HOPE THE LEAD. THREE AND THE POTENTIAL EXISTS EXPANDING ADAM VOTER.

THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN WHILE THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM HAS HAD ITS CHALLENGES I BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL IN REGISTERING ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE. SO I THINK EXPLORING WHETHER OTHER VOTER REGISTRATION AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPAND THEIR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION IS WORTHWHILE. FOR THESE REASONS I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN.

THIS IS A ARCHER CALIFORNIA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT IT CONCLUDED THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL ELECTION TO PROTECT BOTH VOTERS AND POLL WORKERS LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB EIGHT SIXTY WHICH WITH THE SUCCESSFUL BI PARTISAN EFFORT TO SEND EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER A BALLOT AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE EIGHTY SIX AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION. VOTED ON THE BALLOT THAT WAS MAILED TO THEM DATA SHOWS THAT SENDING EVERYONE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL PROVIDES ACT VOTERS ACCESS NEWMAN VOTERS GET BALLOTS IN THE MAIL OF THE VOTE AB THIRTY SEVEN WILL ENSURE EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER BLESS YOU IS MAILED A BALLOT FOR EVERY ELECTION THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN SIMILAR PROVISIONS IN MY EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY LAST YEAR AB THIRTY SEVEN MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ACCOMMODATIONS TO HELP% FACILITATE THE EXPECTED SURGE IN VOTING BY MAIL IN FUTURE ELECTIONS. IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING A RETURN TO VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOADS AND GET MORE BALLOTS COUNTED ON ELECTION NIGHT AND EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT SO THAT VOTERS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED BUT POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS IT ALLOWS ALL VOTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OFFERED BY REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR VOTERS WHO NEED REPLACEMENT BALLOTS OR WHO WANT TO RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE PREFERRED LANGUAGE. FINALLY SB THIRTY SEVEN ENSURES THAT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS pSYSTEM AND OUR PROCESS BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS SB THIRTY SEVEN IS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WERE GONNA NOW MOVES TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS A REMINDER EACH PRIMARY WITNESS HAS A MAXIMUM OF THREE MINUTES WE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE DEAN LOGAN AND NICOLAS REHANI SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH A PRIMARY WITNESS DEAN LOGAN IN FAVOR. OF THE BILL. SUPPORTED BILL. AFTER MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEAN LOGAN AND I'M THE REGISTRAR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AB THIRTY SEVEN I WANT TO THANK CHAIR BERMAN FOR OFFERING THE BILL AND FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT AND ADDRESSING CRITICAL LECTINS ISSUES. FOR CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY SEVEN BUILDS ON THE SUCCESSFUL MITIGATION PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE SAFE SECURE AND ACCURATE ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. IN THE BASE OF THE PANDEMIC. DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE PROACTIVE STANCE TAKEN AND THE RESOURCES PROVIDED IN CALIFORNIA TO PREPARE FOR AND ADMINISTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. VOTERS WERE ABLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS SAFELY AND SECURELY AND RECORD VOTER PARTICIPATION WITH RECORDED. IMPORTANTLY EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN INSURANCE VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE PROVIDED WITH CONSISTENT SERVICES AND ACCESS FOR ALL LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS GOING FORWARD. INCLUDED A PROVISION TO ENSURE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT- OUR MAIL TO ALL ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTERS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW VOTED TO TRACK THE STATUS OF THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAFETY NET OF IN PERSON AND ACCESSIBLE VOTING OPTIONS. AB THIRTY SEVEN PROTECT VOTERS FROM IMPACT OF EXTENDED TRANSIT TIME WHEN RETURNING BALLOTS THROUGH THE MAIL. BY EXTENDING THE TIME FOR RECEIPT A BALLOT THE BALLOT POSTMARKED ON OR BEFORE ELECTION DAY. AND IT EXPANDS THE ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BALLOT TRACKING TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL AS OUR MILITARY AND OVERSEAS CITIZENS. AB THIRTY SEVEN ALSO PRIORITIZES AND FACILITATE THE TRANSPARENT AND ACCURATE CAMERA THING PROCESS. BY ENABLING COUNTY TO SECURELY PROCESS RETURN BALLOTS UPON RECEIPT HELPING TO ENSURE TIMELY AND SUBSTANTIVE ELECTION RESULTS ON ELECTION NIGHT. FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS FOR OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO PUT IN PLACE. PROVISIONS THAT ENSURE OUR ELECTIONS ARE SAFE AND ACCEPTABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS. BASED ON THE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS OF THESE MODELS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY SURE CONSISTENCY OF SERVICES ACROSS ALL COUNTIES. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES RESPECTFULLY. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE LARGEST BLOCK OF POTENTIAL VOTERS IN THE COUNTRY THEIR OWN VALUES AND IDEAS. AND FOR OUR DEMOCRACY TO WORK YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO PARTICIPATE. MICHAELEEN YOU'D BETTER CURRENT IS ON THE RISE IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU'D BETTER TURNOUT IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED BY SEVENTEEN PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION ONE OF THE LARGEST INCREASES OF ANY STATE. CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY CAN DEFEND EVERY VOTER OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WITH LIKELY A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE INCREASE IN TURNOUT. AT OTHER STATES TO IMPLEMENT IT UP BY MAIL PROGRAMS ALSO SAW THE LARGEST INCREASES AND YOU'D BETTER CRAP. AND CALPERS KNOW CALIFORNIA PEOPLE OUT TO THE COLD IN TWENTY TWENTY HELP TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS REGISTER TO VOTE. AND MADE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND GET OUT THE VOTE CONTACT. HELP CALIFORNIANS DIDN'T TURN OUT TO THE POLLS- AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS I CAN'T FIT THAT HAD SOME OF THE HIGHEST TURNOUT RATE. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AND CANNOT ISSUE THE VOTING- WHILE MANNING THE ON CAMPUS POINT LOCATION AT UCLA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND FOR THE PRIMARY ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY- I SPOKE TO STUDENTS WHO. COULDN'T WAIT IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS TO VOTE AND HAD TO LEAVE. SENDING EVERY VOTER OF THAT BY NOW BALLOT IT'S A REMINDER TO VOTE. AND A CONVENIENT OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT A CHECK THE BOX TO REGISTER TO VOTE BY MAIL. BUT STILL THE FACT THAT THE MOSTCONVENIENT OPTION FOR THEM WHEN ELECTION DAY COMES AROUND. WE SHOULD GIVE EVERY ELECTION. SO I ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON EIGHTY THIRD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ONE COLEEN BRITAIN. ARE YOU ON COLEEN. YES I AM ARE YOU MAY PROCEED MISTER CHAIRMAN. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES A. B. THIRTY SEVEN FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS. OF FIRST IS A STIPULATION THAT READS THIS SECTION DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS MAIL A BALLOT TO A VOTER WITH AN INACTIVE VOTER REGISTRATION STATUS. AND QUOTE THIS WEEK STATEMENT DOES NOT PROHIBIT BALLOTS FROM BEING MAILED TO INACTIVE VOTERS AND CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UP TO FOUR AND A HALF MILLION INACTIVE REGISTRANTS TO HAVE BALLOTS MAILED TO THEIR LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. IS IDEA REGIS WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH AN ACT THIS INVITES VOTER IMPERSONATION ON A GRAND SCALE. INSPECTION SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED TO EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS BALLOTS FROM. BEING MAILED TO ENACT YOUR VOTERS. RECENT AMENDMENT TO SB THIRTY SEVEN EXCEPT OF MY AND UP SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION DEADLINE. THIS IS CLEARLY A GIFT TO WOULD BE BAD ACTORS AND THE THREAT YOUR ALEXION INTEGRITY. THE I. P. C. AID MAIN OBJECTION TO AB THIRTY SEVEN LIES IN THE CONTINUED DISARRAY OF VOEPEL THE STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO EVERY LEGISLATURE AND UNTIL IT IS RESOLVED NO FURTHER LAWS SHOULD BE THAT RELY ON VOEPEL INTEGRITYSHOULD BE PASSED. OF CONTRARY TO THE MATH NO I'M NOT MUCH SURE THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF PROBLEMS HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. CALIFORNIA MAIL BALLOTS TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE REGISTRANTS WHO HAD NOT VOTED OR UPDATED THEIR REGISTRATION. AND TWELVE PLUS YEARS. FORTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE HAD MOVED CANCEL INACTIVES. DECEASED OR FAILED TO RESPOND TO NOTICE THAT NOTED ON THEIR RECORDS BUT THEY THEY WERE SPENT A BALLOT ANYWAY. SIXTY SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THESE QUESTIONABLE REGISTRANTS VOTED IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. YOU FOR YOUR ASSURE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS. I WANT YOU TO NOTE THAT ARE PROMINENT REGISTER OF VOTERS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DECLARED THAT THIS PROCESS IS SUBJECTIVE. ELECTORAL RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTIVE ONE CITIZEN ONE VOTE AN OBSCURE OBJECTIVE TALLY SHOULD BE A DETERMINER OF ELECTIONS. APPROXIMATE OUTCOMES BASED ON VERY GENEROUS AND SUBJECTIVE SIGNATURE MATCHING IS OFFENSIVE TO A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WHEN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPENSE BALLOTS IN THE SYSTEM THE CHANCES OF UNTOLD NUMBERS OF THEM BEING ILLEGITIMATELY. HI IT'S OBJECTIVE AN EXTREMELY LAX STANDARD OF SIGNATURE VERIFICATION ALLOWS THOSE TO BE COUNTED. YES WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY I'M GONNA HAVE YOU WRAPPED UP YOU'RE JUST ABOUT AT THE THREE MINUTE. LIMIT OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU ALEX WERE MAILED TO THREE THOUSAND. THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO INDIVIDUALS ON THE DEATH. ON THE DEATH OF INDEX. AND SIXTY EIGHT OF THOSE VOTED YOU ELBOW ON BUT A DOG CLOSING. UNTIL VOEPEL CAN BE SHOWN TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE LIABLE AND VOTER ROLL MAINTENANCE RANGE LEVELS CAN BE SHOWN TO BE A LEGITIMATE. THE MAILING OF BALLOTS TO ALL REGISTRANTS IS RECKLESS IN THE EXTREME WELL ILLEGITIMACY OF ALL ELECTRIC. EMAIL ADDRESS UPDATE. THE CALIFORNIA MUST BE DEMAND MUST BE DEMAND MORE CALLS FOR CAUTION.

TIMESTAMP OR DATE STAND BY BONAFIDE PRIVATE MAIL DELIVERY COMPANY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS A BONA FIDE PRIVATE MAIL COMPANY- I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IDEA OF IF THEY DO. THE- IF A BALLOT IS NOT POSTMARKED IN THERE'S NO DATE STAMP ON THEIR THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT- WITH THAT OUT THOUGH. BALLOT WAS CAST IN THAT IT WAS TIMELY WHAT SORT OF. OF MEASURES- CAN WE CAN WE PLACE IN HERE WE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T CASTING BALLOTS AFTER THE ELECTION ESPECIALLY- IN IN AREAS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE CLOSE A CLOSE RACE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR MAYES IT'S UP TALK ABOUT THAT- PAGE FIVE- IT'S THE STUFF AROUND LINE TWENTY SIX YEAH THE END I APPRECIATE THAT I'VE GOT TO ANSWER FOR IT. WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT GIVING OFFICE HAD THEM BEFORE YEAH I KNOW I WAS EVEN TOLD ME THAT ACTUALLY BY THE WAY DID TRY TO GIVE YOU A QUICK HEADS UP- BUT AND THEN AGAIN. IF YOU CAN ANSWER JUST A BONA FIDE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS AFTERWARDS- AS WELL I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YET- I DON'T WANNA TO JAM YOU HERE- THE OHIO SO- SO IT'S SO I. THREE THEY DON'T HAVE MY FEAR. THE DEFINITION OF BONA FIDE- MAIL DELIVERY SERVICE I CAN GET A FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON. ON THAT. IN REGARDS TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW POSTMARKED AND DIFFERENT. MARKERS THAT THAT- ELECTIONS OFFICIALS MIGHT LOOK AT. THE ACCOMMODATION ONLY APPLIES TO BALLOTS THAT ARE MAILED. DIFFERS ALL AND IT HAS BEEN MAILED BY ELECTION DAY. YEAH AND IN DETERMINING WHETHER A BALLOT WAS MAILED BY ELECTION DAY. THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE POSTMARK ON THE BALLOT OR TURN ENVELOPE. AND OTHER TRACKING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE US POSTAL SERVICE OR TO YOUR POINT. A BONAFIDE PRIVATE MAIL DELIVERY COMPANY. FOR THE EXTRAORDINARILY RARE SITUATION WHERE AN ENVELOPE THAT IS RETURNED BY MAIL DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY LEGIBLE POSTMARK. AND THERE'S NO OTHER TRACKING INFORMATION. AN ELECTIONS OFFICIAL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DATE ON WHICH THE BALLOT WAS SIGNED AND DATED BY THE VOTER TOUCHES. YOUR THOUGHT YEAH SO. IT'S PRETTY TIGHT THIS IS THE SAME LANGUAGE WE HAD HAVE LOST ON DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT ANY. OF THE YOU KNOW ISSUES WITH IT BUT LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON YEAH AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO. WORK WITH YOU AS YOU AS IS BETTER THIS IS THE- FIRST HEARING WHAT AND WE'LL GET TO THAT I KNOW WE HAD THAT ONE QUESTION. BACK DURING THE ELECTION A MEMBER CALLED YOU. YOU'RE ABOUT TO RELATED TO THIS TO THE SAME THING I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY- I'M A STRONG BELIEVER IN HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS- THAT- FACT I WANT TO. US TO HAVE A ALL MAIL BALLOT. ELECTION I THINK IT MAKES. THE MOST SENSE- AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO TRANSITION FROM GOING TO THE POLLS AND THEN ONCE THEY GET THEIR MAIL BALLOTS THEY LOVE. HAVING THAT. THAT MAIL BALLOT I'VE- BEEN BEEN CASTING. BALLOTS VIA MAIL FOR THE LAST I THINK TWENTY YEARS I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS JUST A- COUPLE VOTER SO- I DO- BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS pGO IN IT IS SAFE IT IS SECURE- AND YOU'RE ABLE TO TRACK. THINGS IT'S- SO- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. BRIGITTE THAT ANY DIFFERENT I DO REMEMBER HAVING THAT CONVERSATION- I JUST DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHAT YEAH WE'LL GET IT LOOKING. BACK ON THAT. RIGHT OTHERS. ELSE HAVE QUESTIONS. BERMAN MISTER BENNETT I APPRECIATE BEING A CO AUTHOR OF THIS THE THEIR REQUEST AND- I THE AUTHOR OF FOR OF MOVING- IMPORTANT TO ALLOW AND THAT THAT THAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF MAIL IN BALLOT IS A WAY FOR US TO GO I ALSO DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE WERE SOME- SOME ISSUES RAISED AT THAT WE WANT TONIGHT AND I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE OFFICE IS GOING TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE. HIS INTEGRITY IS EVERYTHING AND IF WE WANT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A MAIL IN BALLOT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE TIGHTEN UP ANY POSSIBILITIES WERE- SOMEBODY COULD SAY HEY THERE'S BEEN A- PRIVATE FIRM HAS BEEN CREATED JUST TO POST DATE THESE THINGS HAVE TO ACCEPT HER I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IS THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD- AND- BUT THE OVERALL BENEFITS OF THIS ARE ENORMOUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- MISTER BENNETT AND I BY ALL MEANS THAT YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT OUR ELECTION SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS REMARKABLY SECURE WORK- IF ANYBODY HAS EVIDENCE OR PROOF OF ANY ELECTION TAMPERING AT ALL. PLEASE LET THE SECRETARY% OF STATE'S OFFICE NO YOU REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE AND LET US KNOW YOU CAN LET LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW WE WANT TO PROSECUTE ANYBODY WHO IS WHO IS TAMPERING WITH OUR ELECTIONS- IT BUT THE EVIDENCE OF THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT TO ANYBODY'S ATTENTION YET- AND SO I THINK THAT OUR SYSTEM OF LIKE THE VOTING IN CALIFORNIA IS REMARKABLY SECURE. AND VOTERS SHOULD FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THAT THEIR VOTE IS BEING COUNTED AND THAT ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN VOTE ARE VOTING PROJECT IF I CAN BE AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL ON THE SERVER THANK YOU MISTER MISS PROHIBIT HI N. BEFORE YOU'RE GONNA CLOSE I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS- IT GAVE ME A WHOLE VOTER ELECTION AND. I MEAN. THERE'S REALLY. THERE IS THIS. WITH AND THE STRUGGLE IS THE- WE DO ONE. WHO SERVICE IS ENTITLED TO VOTE TO VOTE. WE DO WANT TO LIMIT VOTER SUPPRESSION BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN HERE WHETHER WHAT HOWEVER THEY GOT YOU KNOW THE AYE THE- THEIR CONCERNS WERE RICH A RAISED. THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY PART AND JUSTICE MR BENNETT WAS SAYING- THAT PART HAS TO BE ADDRESSED IN OUR EFFORTS TO REFORM THE ELECTION PROCESS- THE BALLOT IN. THE MAIL IN BALLOT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I BELIEVE IT WAS THERE IS A PANEL ON- D. ELECTION AL REFORM. AND THE ONE THING THAT THEY SAID WE SHOULD THEY SHOULD WOULD BE MOST COST IS ABOUT IS AN ALL MAIL BALLOT AND THAT'S WHY. N. A. N. A. N. A. PAINS ME WHEN PEOPLE JUST DISMISS THE CONCERNS OF MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE SHOULD BE SURE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE POLLS THEIR VOTE ATUALLY DOES COUNT. AND IT BECAUSE IF THEY LOSE THAT CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTING SYSTEM THAT'S ALSO VOTER SUPPRESSION BECAUSE IF THEY LOSE IT AND JUST STOPPED GOING- THEN WE'RE LOSING THE VOICE OF THAT PERSON. SO YOU KNOW I CAN TAKE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE ON HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTING SYSTEM- BUYS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN. AND SO WITH THAT I'LL LET YOU CLOSE AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL THANKS APPRECIATE THAT IN A YOU KNOW I AGREE THAT THAT THERE ARE THERE IS A- NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTING SYSTEM YOU KIND OF DISMISSED THE WHY YOU SAID WHATEVER THE REASON AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE WHY AND THE WHY IS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND IT'S A DARN SHAME THAT THEY DID THAT AND THAT THEY ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY IN IN THE IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. ABOUT A REMARKABLY SAFE ELECTION. SYSTEM AND IT WOULD BE A TRAVESTY. OF OUR DEMOCRACY. A WE LET THOSE. AND THE UNCERTAIN THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY THOSE LAWS IS. TO CAUSE US TO PUT. THE LAWS IN PLACE THAT RESTRICT. PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO VOTE OR MAKE IT HARDER. FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE SO I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO EXPRESS TO PEOPLE AND EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE. THAT ARE ELECTION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. IS REMARKABLY SECURE. BUT I WILL NOT BE A PART. OF LETTING LIES TOLD BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS. LEAD TO LAWS THAT SUPPRESS VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN I SAY OUR TELL NO SE ARCH- NO FAN AT. PLANET I LOW LO I MAYES. ARAMBULA MULLIN I RUBIO WELCOME I. SIXTY ONE THAT MOTION GOES FORWARD SIX ONE SO THAT MOVES US TO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA ALSO VIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN THIS WILL BE A B. TWO THIRTY SIX THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AGAIN AND- GO AHEAD WITH YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. HAS IDENTIFIED A TROUBLING PATTERN WHICH LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES HAVE MADE LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES WITHOUT MEANINGFUL DISCLOSURE. ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THOSE ALL SEIZE AND ONE PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE AN LLC FORMED LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION. CONTRIBUTED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO AN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE SET UP TO SUPPORT AND OPPOSE CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL IN SANTA ANA. AT THAT ELECTION THAT ALFIE DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. NOR DID IT DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDS THAT THEY USED TO MAKE ITS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. AS A RESULT SANTA ANA VOTERS HAD NO MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE. OF MAJOR EXPENDITURES IN CITY ELECTIONS UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAW DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THERE IS FULL AND TRUTHFUL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE SOURCE. OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES THAT ARE FUNDED BY LLCS. AB TWO THIRTY SIX REQUIRES ALL FEES THAT MAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE SPECIFIED MEMBERS OF THE L. C. FOR THAT VOTERS HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUE SOURCE OF FUNDS USED BY ALL SEIZE. IN STATE ELECTIONS I WANT TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL IN ITS OPPOSITION LETTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SAYS THAT THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY IN LIGHT OF REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE AT BBC. AND THAT IS APPLIED. UNEVENLY BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO ALL SEES BUT NOT TO UNIONS OR CORPORATIONS. WELL THE F. PPC'S REGULATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AROUND POLITICALLY ACTIVE L. SEES. THE REGULATIONS DO NOT ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDS. THAT LLCS USED FOR THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY. WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL FOCUSES L. C. THE BECAUSE IT IS TARGETED. TO ADDRESS A GAP IN DISCLOSURE RULES IDENTIFIED BY THE F. B. P. C. THE F. B. B. C. HAS NOT SEEN EVIDENCE THAT OTHER TYPES OF ENTITIES ARE BEING USED. TO OBSCURE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS. USING CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS IN THE SAME MANNER. WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAMBER ABOUT THOSE POINTS WHICH WERE INITIALLY IN WHICH WE WERE INITIALLY MADE AWARE OF. VIA THEIR FORMAL LEVEL LETTER OF OPPOSITION. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM ON THIS BILL. AB TWO THIRTY SIX IS SPONSORED BY THE F. B. B. C. AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. ISLANDS IN A CONDO AT THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR THE F. T. P. C. IS ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFIED SUPPORT. AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THE PRIMARY WITH. THIS PART OF THE BILL ON THANK YOU HAVE THAT ONE. COULD BE A PART. YOUR ONLINE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR AND MY NAME IS MCCAW AND I AM LIKE COUNCIL FOR THE FAIR PLAY A PRACTICE COMMISSION. FIFTY THREE IF THE STATE COMMISSION THAT ADMINISTERS AND ENFORCES THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT WHICH REGULATES CAMPAIGN FINANCING CONFLICT OF INTEREST LOBBYING AND GOVERNMENTAL ETHICS. COMMISSION IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BATTLE. OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE FTC HAS FOUND INCREASING INSTANCES OF LLCS BEING USED THE VEHICLES FOR DARK MONEY IN STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS. UNDER EXISTING LAW LLC CAN BE FOUND QUICKLY AND RELATIVELY ANONYMOUSLY AND CAN MAKE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS SOON AFTER AND THERE'S USUALLY NO WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO FIND OUT. WHO IS ACTUALLY FUNDING THE CONTRIBUTION. THE GOAL OF EIGHTY THREE THREE SIX TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY BY SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE TRUE SOURCE OF FUNDS. BY ANY L. L. B. OFFENSE MONEY ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE STATE ARE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE L. L. C. OR IN OTHER WORDS THE CLOSURE OF WHO HAS FUNDED THE ALFIE. THE TYPICALLY EIGHTY TO TWENTY SIX REQUIRING LLC THAT REACHES A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY THAT WOULD ALREADY UNDER CURRENT LAW. SUBJECT THE LLC TO REGULATION UNDER THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT AT THE COMMITTEE A COMMITTEE SPONSOR FILE A STATEMENT OF MEMBERS SECRETARY OF STATE. THE STATEMENT WOULD NOT DISCLOSE EVERY MEMBER OF THE L. L. C. BUT RATHER ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE A 10% OR GREATER MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS. OR HAD MADE A CUMULATIVE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE L. L. C. AB ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR MORE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD. APART FROM THE STATEMENT OF MEMBERS EIGHTY TWO THREE SIX OFF THE CAR BY TWO RECENT REGULATE. INCREASING AVAILABLE ABOUT OUT OF. EVANS MONEY ON ACTIVITY THE STATE. WHAT THE THAT THESE ARE CURRENT. AND THIS OF THE BILL. THAT EXIT LAW. BEACH REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT STEPS TO INCREASING TREND. ALONE DON'T GIVE PUBLIC IN. ABOUT THE TWO SOURCE OF FUN WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS CRUCIAL. ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THE FOCAL REFORM ACT WITH TO ESTABLISH STRONG DISCLOSURE LAWS. THAT THE PUBLIC IS INFORMED ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND INTERESTS WHO ARE FUNDING CAMPAIGNS IN THE STATE. OF THE SHOULD NOT BE A VEHICLE FOR CONCEALING IDENTITY FOR SKIRTING CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF AN LLC FUNDERS WHEN IT SPENDS MONEY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. EIGHTY TWO THREE SIX STRENGTHENS THE STATE CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE LAWS AND ENSURES THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS TO CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SAY I DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER. WOULD IN SUPPORT GO TO THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SHOP MUHAMMAD GO AHEAD IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE. AND THEN- TAKE YOUR SELECTED CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS MANAGE WHAT MUHAMMAD CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE GET RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO THIRTY SIX. EIGHTY TWO THIRTY SIX EXPENSE THE DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS FOR ALLOCATING GAUGING POLITICAL ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING THEM TO IDENTIFY AND DISCLOSE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE L. G. EVEN IF THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT INVOLVED. IN THE YELLOW SUIT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. THIS REQUIREMENT- AS MENTIONED WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY OTHER ENTITY JEFF. AND IF YOU JUST D. ADDITIONALLY CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE REQUIRED. TO IDENTIFY NEW PEOPLE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE OFFICER TO DIRECT THE L. D. CORTICAL ACTIVITY BUT IF THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANALYSES PUT OUT POLITICAL ACTIVITY. THE CURRENT READ GRADUATION TOO SURPRISED. UNDER THE PROPOSED AB TWO THIRTY SIX HOWEVER THE STATURE CONTENT TO HOLD INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEPARATE ENTITIES POLITICAL SPEECH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE ELEGY PLAYS A ROLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. IN SO DOING AB TWO THIRTY SIX ALSO FAILED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A GENERAL PURPOSE PHD ONE ON ONETIME LLC IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS DISTINCTION IS IMPORTANT WHEN ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THE SPELLING SHORTCUTS. ADDITIONALLY THE HUNDRED DOLLAR. THRESHOLD IT IS TOO LOW TO TRIGGER APPLICATION UNDER THE SPELL WE DO NOT THINK THE BILL INTENDS TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FOLKS TO. MAKE DONATIONS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE POSTPONEMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CONCERNS WITH THE INTENT TO ADDRESS ON NECESSARILY RESOLVED BY REGULATING INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SUCH A SMALL SIZE. FOR THESE REASONS WE GET RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE FIVE EIGHTY TWO THIRTY SIX BUT OF COURSE WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING- WITH WITH YOUR OFFICE FURTHER ON THIS BILL AND ONE THANK YOU. AND YOUR STAFF IN PARTICULAR FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND WORKING WITH US ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU THAT.

THAT IS THAT- IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IT SAYS YOU CAN'T DO AN INITIATIVE. THAT BENEFITS YOURSELF PERSONALLY OR A CORPORATION. AND WE HAD A CLEVER- GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT FORMED AN LLC AND DID AN INITIATIVE THAT BENEFITED THEMSELVES AND WE WENT TO COURT AND SAID THAT VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION AND THE JUDGE INCREDIBLY SAID AN LLC IS NOT A- CORPORATION AND NOT AN INDIVIDUAL SO THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CREATE AN INITIATIVE THAT BENEFITED THEMSELVES. UP IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S AN EXACT A AN EXAMPLE OF WHY LLC'S YOU WE HAVE TO. MAKE THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR SO I APPRECIATE THE F. PPC COMING FORWARD WITH THIS- I WOULD LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS JUST TO MEMORIALIZE MY FIGHT OVER THIS YEAR. IN THE PAST.

MOREOVER BY IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF MILLIONS OF VOTERS MAILING ADDRESSES AND REDUCING RELIANCE ON IN PERSON SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN INCREASING ACCESS TO VOTE BY MAIL. BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION AT NEW OR UPDATED VOTER REGISTRATIONS RESULTED FROM THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM DESPITE THESE SUCCESSES CHALLENGES WITH MODERNIZING THE MOTOR VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS CONTINUES TO LIMIT THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS AB SEVENTY SIX WHAT APPLY LESSONS LEARNED AND ADOPT FEDERAL MOTOR VOTER TIMELINES FOR TIMELY TRANSMITTAL OF VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION FROM THE DMVTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AS WELL AS QUALIFYING NUMBER OF BEST PRACTICES FROM THE ONGOING SETTLEMENT INCLUDING DATA REPORTING ON PROCESSING TIMES TRADING TRAINING OF THE DMV AND SOS STAFF AND MAINTAINING COORDINATORS AT THE DMV AND SECRETARY OF STATE TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL AND% STATE MOTOR VOTER LAWS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT AB SEVENTY SIX WILL ENSURE THAT THE PROGRESS MADE UNDER UR NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE.
