WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION YET DOES BUT AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE DO HAVE A FEW I CAN CONCERNED ABOUT WORK WORKLOAD AND FUNDING ISSUES. AND HOW THIS COULD AFFECT PRIORITIES SUCH AS I'M IMPROVING ACCESS TO THE SEA IF YOU IN OUR GRADUATION. INITIATIVE ON THAT WERE ALSO A LITTLE BIT CAN CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER PER PROVIDING STE. SERVICES TO STUDENTS FOR FOR THIS LONG COULD IMPACT SERVICES TO CURRENT STUDENTS. ON THAT WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. THANK YOU. ERICA REMAIN ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE ALSO DO NOT HAVE A POSITION AT THIS TIME. BUT DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY DOING THIS AS TWITCH INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT PUBLICLY FUNDED.

ANY ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT HEARING NONE. SCENE NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NO WE DON'T HAVE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NOPE. OKAY CHAIR IF I CANNOT COMMENT THOUGH ON THE. SOME CONCERN DOT COM IS SET THAT I HEAR. IT IS SO VERY. UNLIKELY THAT THE CURRENT OPERATION OF. CARILLO CENTERS SO WOULD BE. LA OVERWHELMED BY EXTENDING THIS PERIOD THAT BECAUSE AS YOU AS I MENTIONED THAT UP. ADULT RATIO OF AQUARIUS IT SENT TO YOU SEE YOU CELEBRATE YOU LOW IS TO SIMPLY PROVIDING THE FLEXIBILITY RATHER THAN JUST A LIMITING. YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS US SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE PEAK ADDITIONAL ACOSTA AND THE OR SO WE ARE NOT MANDATING. ANY ARE NOW UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES TO WITHOUT THE KOREA CENTER CURRENTLY TO HAVE IT. WHEN THEY HAVE OF SUCH SERVICES. UP TO BE A FLEXIBLE. MISS QUIRK SILVA QUESTION COMMENT I WAS GONNA MAKE A COMMENT I DO I DO LIKE THIS BILL BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT. ON. NOT ONLY FOR MY OWN A. CHILDREN THAT AT ALL GRADUATED RECENTLY IS THAT SOME OF THE STUDENTS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAREER CENTER. HOT DURING THEIR FOUR YEARS BUT ONCE THEY ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A JOB OR NEEDING OUGHT TO REALLY FINALIZE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT FORWARD TO THE. COMMUNITY IN THE WORKPLACE SOMETIMES THEY DO JUST WANT THAT EXTRICITY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI SAYS THAT THERE'S THIS COULD BE A RUN ON CAREER PLACEMENTS AND PEOPLE CAN BE STANDING OUTSIDE SO. AYE I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS EVEN AFTER THEY GRADUATE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IF NOT WE WILL THEN GO ON TO YEARS SECOND BILL DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON NOT MY SECOND BILL AND ASIDE EIGHT BE NINETEEN SIXTY ONE THIS ONE HAS TO DO. A SPECIFIC FOKKER'S SAW OF CONCERN AS HOW CUANDO. A COLLEGE OR FOR THE MEDIA PLANS. AB NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. INCREASES THE FREEDOM OF THE TORIES FOR STUDENTS. BY PREVENTING COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO FROM. REQUIRING THE PURCHASE OF A MID PLANS. AS A CONDITION OF OUR LIVING IN CAMPUS UP PROVIDED A HOSTING. ADDITIONALLY UNIVERSITIES SAW A WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SEPARATE. COST OF A CAMPUS PROVIDED A MEDIA PLANS. AND THE HOUSING PLAN SO ON THEIR CAMPERS WEBSITES. AND THE LITERATURE TO INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY. THIS YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF. CALIFORNIA IRVINE. THE CURRENT COST OF OUR ROOM AND BOARD. YOU KNOW NOW ONE CAMPUS OF OUR TRIP OCCUPANCY ROOM. OUT WITH A MEAL PLAN PORTER SAID NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SOME UNIVERSITIES HOSTED REQUIRE FRESHMEN AND THE TRANSFER OF STUDENTS HAVE TO PURCHASE A MINUTE PLANS TO. EVEN A FATHER HOUSING UNITS ARE. THAT THEY LIVE IN NOW OFFER POKING AMENITIES. OVER THE PAST DECADE. AVERAGE ABOARD THE. THAT IS SOUGHT TWENTY. MIA SUPPORT WEEK GOV AT THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGES TO HAS A REASON FORTY SIX UP PERCENT. TWO FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS TO FOUR. ARE THAT WAS SO A LITTLE BIT DOT ORG DATA TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS. THIS REQUIREMENT. NOT TO PURCHASE A MEAL PLAN ELIMINATES A STUDENT TORIES. IN A DETERMINING WHAT WOULD BE MORE ECONOMICAL FOR DO WELLBEING. BY ENACTING A BE NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WE ENSURE CHOI EACH SET AND THE FLEXIBILITY FOR STUDENTS AND. THEIR PARENTS. THE BETTER A FULL. A COTTAGE. I RESPECTFULLY. ASK WILL YOUR AYE VOTE AS WELL. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WINNERS ARE AYE THAT'S GOOD WINNERS AND NOT SEEN ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON. ALEX GRAVES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL. OUT WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST COMPONENT REGARDING DIS AGGREGATING THE INFORMATION FOR OUR MEAL PLANS VERSUS HOUSING THAT WE MOST NOT ALL OUR CAMPUSES ARE YOU DO THAT. REGARDING THE PROVISION ON THE MEAL PLANS I JUST NOT A FEW THINGS ARE THERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNIVERSITY OPERATED HOUSING ARE FROM YOUR KIND OF TRADITIONAL DORMITORY TO UNIVERSE ARE EXCUSE ME. TOO I YOUR APARTMENT STYLE HOUSING WHERE YOU HAVE NO FULL KITCHENS IN THE RESIDENTS. AND OUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE REQUIREMENT AROUND MEAL PLANS FOR RESIDENCY ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE UNITS WHICH DO NOT HAVE A KITCHEN IN THE UNIT. AND I WOULD THINK I WOULD SAY THAT OUR CONCERNS NAMELY FOCUSED ON A FEW THINGS FIRST OUT. CONTRACTUALLY WE DO HAVE EXISTING CONTRACTS AND WE DO. AND HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT SOME OF OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS AS WELL AS OUR. ABILITY NEGOTIATE FUTURE CONTRACTS AT BEST PRICES. AT IT IN TERMS OF STUDENT SAFETY I OBVIOUSLY IN OUR DORMITORIES WE DON'T ALLOW HOT PLATES OR TOASTER OVENS. DUE TO FIRE SAFETY CONCERNS AND LASTLY I ON STUDENT CHOICE I WE WE ARE CANCERS PROVIDE A RANGE OF MEAL PLANS. A DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS FOR STUDENTS TO CHOOSE FROM AND WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER THOSE. STUDENTS QUITE NUTRITIOUS MEALS AT IN SOME INSTANCES I ON THE COME ARE FULL SCALE MEAL PLANS UNDER FIVE DOLLARS A MEAL FOR UNLIMITED SWIPES ALL YOU CAN EAT WHILE YOU'RE THERE. SO CAN WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE CONTENT WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE TO DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL. WHOEVER YOU WANTED ARTICULATE IF YOU CONCERNS WE ARE SEVERAL THE CAMPUSES LISTED URINALYSIS THAT DO NOTS OF BREAKOUT OR TOWARDS THIS AGGREGATE. THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO MEAL PLANS AND AND. ROOM COSTS AND SO EXTENT THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WOULD REPLY REQUIRE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE CAN DO THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CURRENTLY DO AND. WITH REGARD TO. WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT THERE'S NOT JUST ROOM AND BOARD AS A FUNCTION OF THAT OF THAT? CALCULATION IT ALSO INCLUDES. OTHER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THE IN THE RESIDENTIAL SETTING SUCH AS. WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY SERVICES COMPUTING LABS PRINTING SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES THAT WE OFFER WITHIN OUR DORMITORIES AND SO. THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE ON THE MAIN POINT WHETHER NOT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE RUDE. DISINCLINED TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF THE MEAL PLAN SERVICES WE WOULD ARGUE THAT. GIVEN THE. ISSUES AROUND FOOD SECURITY OF OUR STUDENTS AND OTHER THINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR STUDENTS OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THAT IT'S. THE MOST EFFICIENT MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO. ABUNDANT. NUTRITIOUS AND AFFORDABLE FOOD IS BY VIRTUE OF THE BILL PLAN SO BILLS THE CONSTITUENTS WOULD RAISE THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M CHAIR DURACELL BE ON BEHALF OF THE CAL STATE SOON ASSOCIATION WE ALSO DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL ON AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF GIVING STUDENTS CHOICE. WHERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT FORTY ONE PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE CSU SUFFER FROM FOOD INSECURITY AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT GIVEN THAT CHOICE ON STUDENTS WITHOUT A MEAL PLAN MIGHT? CHOOSE TO JOIN THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM FROM FOOD INSECURITY SAU THANK YOU. ERICA REMAIN ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE TO DO NOT HAVE A POSITION. IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS AROUND FOOD AND SECURITY AT OUR CAMPUSES ARE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE SIZES TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WE HAVE SOME FAIRLY SMALL CAMPUSES. OUR CONCERN IS THAT SHOULD ENOUGH STUDENTS OPT OUT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOOD SERVICES BECAUSE WE COULD NOT GET A PROVIDER OR WE WILL HAVE TO BRING A IN HOUSE. RAISING COSTS FOR EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS BAKER. THANK YOUR AS CHAIR AND THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI. IT YEAH CERTAINLY SEE A GREAT. BENEFIT TO PARENTS JUST BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW COST PLAY OUT I I DO ALSO HAVE HOWEVER MY DISTRICT ST MARY'S COLLEGE ONE OF THE SMALLER DISTRICTS THAT IS. CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF THIS TO THEM IN THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH THEIR SINS IN THEIR OWN WAY AND AND WHAT THEY OFFER WHAT THEY DON'T OFFER. AND I WENT I WENT IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT. ABOUT THAT KNOWING THAT SOME PARENTS WILL SAY I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO GET A MEAL EVEN IF THEY DON'T EAT IT. IF THEY DON'T THINK IT IS BETTER THAN PIZZA. WHATEVER ELSE IT IS. AND IF YOU ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE. FOLKS HAVE COME UP IN THE TRAINER'S AREA TO. A VISIT WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS. I THINK THIS SOB BAYLOR HAS DONE NOTHING TO DO. WITH THE UP PARENT COLORLESS CHILDREN'S SAW OPTION TO BUY INTO. ULTIMATE PLANS SO COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY OR OR FOR. SIMPLY I'M ASKING. UNLESS A SEPARATE. BECAUSE SO WE KNOW THEY WOULDN'T ALL. HOW MUCH THE METED OUT WOULD COST THEM? WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE FUNDED IS TO GATHER? AND OUT THERE SO NO OPTION FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I LIVED DOT. THAT THAT. LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY DORMITORY CHEAPEST A DORMITORY I LIVED AND. I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT REQUIRED FOR ME TO BUY THEM IN A PLAN. I WAS ABLE TO LOOK BY INCIDENTS MASTERS OF SOME SEMESTERS I COULD NOT THE. MAN I COULD NOT THE BY INTO ULTIMATE PLANS SO. EITHER A I GO TO STUDENT OUR UNION WHICH HAS SO ABUNDANCE OF PICK AND CHOOSE SAFE I HAVE MORE MONEY ACTON CHOOSE TO THIRTY FOUR PANTRIES. WHEN ALICE SAW IN ALL POOR THAN I EACH WAS ON THE RISE SO WHAT WHAT SHOULD. SO ONE BOWL. THAT THOUGH THE SUSTAIN ME AND THAT THAT. GAVE ME OPTION TO SAVE MONEY I CAN AFFORD TO SO I THINK WITH THIS OPTION GIVES UP. RATHER THAN BECAUSE WE ALL TALK ABOUT THE COLLEGE COST IS SO TOO HIGH UP FOR PEOPLE TO ATTEND THE COLLEGE. SO ARE A. I DON'T MEAN NUTRISYSTEM MANNER. HAVE BEEN NOT TALKED ABOUT. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THE HOWEVER. ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEND THE POLITICS OUT IN OUR MORE ECONOMICAL. ARE A CHOICE OUT THAT THEY CAN EVEN CREATE. AND ALSO THERE FOR A WE ARE NOT ASKING. STUDENTS ARE NOT TO BUY INTO OUR WHAT COLLEGES NOT TO PROVIDE THE NUTRITIOUS ME OUTSIDE. OF THE DOOR. COST WOULD BE THIS SEMESTER NEXT SEMESTER WILL BE THE SAME SAME NUTRITION HOWEVER I'M ONLY ASKING. ARE A SEPARATE. HOUSING COSTS OF WORDS ESTIMATE COSTA AND LET THEM KNOW AND ARE. IF I CHOOSE TO LIVE ON CAMPERS. I DON'T HAVE TO BUY INTIMATE PLAN FOR WHATEVER REASON AND SAW A THAT THE I MAY HAVE A KITCHEN NAKED DOT A KITCHEN AMENITIES OF SOME SOME UNIVERSITIES TO HOUSING. WELL AS I MENTIONED THE DO WE HAVE THAT THE BUSTIER THEY HAVE TO. UP BY INTO ME TO PLAN TO LEAVE ONE THAT DOES THE TEMPEST. SO AND THE DEPEND UPON UNIVERSITIES SIR SOME URBAN UNIVERSITIES ARE OUTSIDE THIS OR CONSERVE OUR. IT A FAST FOOD THOUGH LOW FACILITIES SO RESTAURANTS OR WHATEVER SO IT IS ARE NOTSIMPLY PROVIDING THE TRANSPARENCY AND THEN OPTION FOR THE PARENTS SO AND THE STUDENTS TO TO CHOOSE FROM. TO THE. AMERICAN INDEPENDENT OR THE ASSOCIATION AND PET COLLEGES CONCERNED THAT PARTICULAR FOR THE SMALLER COLLEGES THAT. THEY GIVEN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT THEY HAVE A MAY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME OFFERING. ECONOMICAL FOOD TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE OF TWO MAY OPT OUT WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE RESPONSE TO THEIR CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE RAISED. I THINK THAT IS SO. A INSTANCE ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE BUT WE NOT BENEFIT THAT BY SENDING THE MINUTE PLAN THAT TO SUBSIDIZE SUCH NOT ELECTING FUNDING SO FOR THE GENERAL FUND. BUT NOW WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENTS I THINK GOOD VASO INSTITUTIONALLY OUT THEY NEED TO SOLVE OUR. OUR THE SUSTAINABLE THE BUDGET ISSUES UP BUT NOT HERE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS ARE AFFORDABILITY ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY. S. ARE NOT NOW OVER CHARGED A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO TO THEM. SO WE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUTRITION THAT I USE A HOWEVER. A IT IS AN OPTION IF THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT IF THEY CAN GET THOSE SCHOLARSHIPS ARE. YOU KNOW ALONE SO BY ALL MEANS SO FOR THEM TO BUY THEIR MADE PLANS ON KNOWING THAT THE HOW MUCH EXTRA COSTA. A IT IT WILL COST THEM TO BUY PUMP CAMPUS PROVIDED MALES YEAH I THINK THE I APPLAUD THE EFFORT TO BE STUDENT CENTRIC SO THAT THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO I HOPE THAT AND CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE IT. THIS INTERACTING AND VISITING WITH THE. INDEPENDENT COLLEGES THAT HAVE EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THIS. AS I SHARE IT AND I HOPE TO BE A CHANCE TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THEM ON THAT ONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU GOT. I IS THERE SOMEONE WHO I IS FROM I GUESS THE CSU OUR I MAYBE THAT THE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS TO THAT THAT COULD ANSWER QUESTIONS I DON'T. DON'T SEE ANYONE. STILL UP HERE. THANK YOU I I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY OF SCALE OR EVEN A LITTLE BETTER SO I AM. I MEAN YOU KNOW I AT WHAT POINT DID TO OPT OUT START TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON COSTS AYE AND HOW HOW MUCH HOW BIG WILL THE IMPACT BE. AT SARAH. SEWER EIGHT. FOR THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW MANY INSTITUTIONS WAITED. LOSE THE ABILITY BUT FOR INSTANCE. MILLS COLLEGE IN OAKLAND. HAD RECENTLY BROUGHT IT IN FROM. BEING FULLY IN THE HOUSE TO SAVE THE STUDENTS MONEY. AND THEY'RE BARELY MEETING THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE FOR THEIR PROVIDER. SO IF THEY HAVE STUDENTS OPTING OUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT BACK IN BECAUSE THE PROVIDERS WEREN'T WILLING TO COME IN WITHOUT THE GUARANTEE. AYE SOME AND I CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS TO HOW MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES. THAT WOULD BE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE TO BRING IT IN HOUSE BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE INSTITUTIONS OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS COSTS. I'M. PLUGIN ALEX RAISE OF THE CSU AND I THINK I CAN SAY GENERALLY IS THAT. TOP PERSON PROBLEM. I THINK IT'S A GENERALLY IS THAT OUR DINING AND. THROUGH OUR AND HOUSING SERVICES ARE BOTH AUXILIARIES ARE SELF SUPPORT. SO THEY ARE NONPROFIT ENTITIES THEY DON'T MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF STUDENTS. AND WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATING THEIR CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS LIKE THE DECKS ON OTHERS ARE OFTENTIMES IN THOSE CONTRACTS THERE ARE BASS LINE REVENUE GUARANTEES THAT AT THAT. THAT WILL LOCK IN THE PRICE POINTS FOR THERE'D THAT EITHER PURCHASING THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING THOSE CONTRACTS AND SO ON I MEAN IF IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YOU KNOW SANSOME NUMBERS CRUNCH TIME KIND OF WHITE CHANGE ON ONE SIDE EQUALS CAO ONE ON THE OTHER I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AND CHECK IN WITH OUR FOLKS WHO RUN OUR AUXILIARIES ON OUR CAMPUSES. BUT GENERALLY OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF THERE IS. A SIGNIFICANT. OR NOTABLE REDUCTION IN STUDENTS UTILIZING OUR DINING SERVICES THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE UP. LIKELY IN THE FORM OF INCREASING OUR PRICES FOR STUDENTS WHO DO OPT INTO THOSE THING HOW MANY STUDENTS WE TALK ABOUT WHEN HE'S UP THERE IS OBVIOUSLY VARIES A LOT I BET ON CAMPUS CAMPUS BUT WHAT'S THE GENERAL. BALLPARK THIRD STUDENTS PARTICIPATING DINING SERVICES. I'LL GOSH I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU I AFTER I CHECK WITH OUR FOLKS NINE SENT THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS I'M SURE IT AND MAKING I WOULD ASSUME SO AND AGAIN I I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT TO NUMBERS OUT WITHOUT CHECKING MAY BE HAPPY DEFAULT THEIR OFFICE. OKAY YEAH I I STRUGGLE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT HOW THIS IS MUCH OF A PROBLEM FOR THE CSU. AND I YOU KNOW FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE WORSE SETTING POLICY FOR AND. I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE FORCING SOME STUDENTS TO HAVE THIS MEAL PLAN ORDER SUBSIDIZE. THE COST FOR EVERYONE I MEAN IN THEORY WE CAN DO THAT WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT YOU DID FOR STUDENTS TO BUY THEIR LAPTOPS FROM THE UNIVERSITIES THAT WE CAN GET BETTER. BOLT DISCOUNTING PRICE. ON THE OTHER HAND. I DO THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE UNIVERSITY. THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING UP CAMPUS LIFE. MAYBE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT HAVE A CAMPUS WANTS TO SAY THAT WE WANNA I HAVE EVERYONE TAKE THEIR MEALS IN THE SAME PLACES LIVING ON CAMPUS IN ORDER TO BUILD COMMUNITY. THEN MAYBE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THAT OPTIONS I DO KNOW THAT DOCTOR CHOI WOULD YOU BE. OPEN TO AN AMENDMENT THAT MIGHT MAKE THIS APPLIED TO. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS I BET MAYBE NOT THOSE THAT ARE PRIVATE IN THE RECEIVING CAL GRANTS. THIS BILL LAW SPECIFIES SAW IN NEON. INDEPENDENT PROFIT THE UNIVERSITY IS SO. STUDENTS OF RECEIVING OUR STATE FUNDING. IF THEY'LL RECEIVE A STATE FUNDING I THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO. IT'S ABOUT INCLUDE ANY. PRIVATE UNIVERSITY THAT HAS STUDENTS WHO A. RECEIVE CONFERENCE CORRECT. YEAH AS ENEMIES OF THEY RECEIVE ARE NOW STATE FUNDING SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO. OPTION TO I HAVE A SOME DIALOGUE THAT. HOW? I MEAN. THIS IS UP BALANCE ACT JUST AS SELF NOT TO OVAL TEAR ON. THEM MOTHER GOOSE I. A I MEAN THAT WE CANNOT WE'RE GONNA HOW. UNIVERSITIES SAYS. STAY HEALTHY. AT THE SAME TIME A I'M MORE SPEAKING FROM THESE CHILDREN MISS POINT OF VIEW. OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND OF TRANSPARENCY WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST BECAUSE I LEAVE ARE. OUT ON THE CAMPUS HOUSING NOT IN MY FORCED TO BUY IN TO MEET PLAN. WHERE I CAN GET BY MUCH LESS THAT WOULD SAY BLOW CONGRESS UP THOUSAND DOLLARS? YEAH ALRIGHT Y. I GENERALLY LIKE THE IDEA I'M HAPPY TO VOTE TODAY THAT I MOVE FORWARD I WOULD AND COULD YOU TO TALK TO THE FOLKS AT THE AYE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND I SEE WHETHER THIS SOLUTION IS. IT'S FITTING FOR THEM IS A MIGHT BE FIRST THE CS USE THANK. MR WITH. YES I I THINK THERE'S THERE WERE A LOT OF THE. GOOD POINTS BROUGHT UP TODAY AND I DO LIKE THE FIRST. PART OF YOUR BILL BREAKING OUT THE THE. ROOM AND BOARD AND THE. THAT THE MEAL PLANS AND THEN YOU TO BUT I THINK OTHER. ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP LIKE FOOD INSECURITY ARE. I THINK THOSE ARE RELEVANT ISSUES LIKE I DO THINK THE COLLEGES SHOULD OFFER FLEXIBILITY SO. UP POTENTIALLY LOWER PRICED MEAL PLANS BUT NOW I LOOK AT THIS IN THE EXTREME IF YOU END UP. BOB IN THE DORM SETTING WITH NO COOKING OF FACILITIES AND A LOT OF THESE STORMS. AND I HAD THREE KIDS THAT WENT THROUGH COLLEGE THEY'RE VERY CROWDED THREE PEOPLE TO A ROOM. THEY ALL TURNED OUT MEAL PLAN AND NOW THEY HAVE THEIR ROOMS FILLED WITH. FOOD YOUR YOUR POTENTIALLY GOING TO HAVE RODENT ISSUES YOU COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE FOOD SAFETY ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S. NOT UNREASONABLE FOR COLLEGES TO TO TRY TO AVOID THAT SITUATION. SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE A RESPONSE THAT OR NOT BUT IT'S. THOSE COLLEGE DORM ROOMS THAT I'VE BEEN TO DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL LOAVES OF BREAD OR JARS OF PEANUT BUTTER OF. FLOATING AROUND THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE. ANY MEAL PLAN AT ALL YEAH I CAN SEE THAT UP POSSIBILITY. BUT. ARE. THERE SOME. AS THE CAMPUS PROVIDED A HOUSING. OUT UNITS OUT WITH ME EVEN COOKING FACILITIES SO WHEN THEY AND. STUDENTS ARE LEAVING THEIR THEY HAVE NO OPTION SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT THEY ARE LIKELY IF THEY CAN USE THEIR OUT KITCHEN FACILITIES ABOUT THAT THOSE OUT WITHOUT IT BUT I THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF OUR. COLLEGES SETTING THE OPEN POLICIES ON THE COOKING ITSELF AND UBER AND WHAT ALLOW DECADE IN THE DORMITORIES CELL WITH NO KIDS AND I MANAGED. AND ALLEN SO I MEAN I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT BUT CERTAINLY WITH MY KIDS AND THEY WERE NOT FORCE TO TAKE A MEAL PLAN IF THERE WERE COOKING FACILITIES THEY WERE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE A MEAL PLAN IF THERE WEREN'T ANY COOKING FACILITIES. THE FBI AREAS SAW IS A FIRE HAZARD THOUGH RULED ON. WHATEVER YEAH ISSUE SANITARY ISSUES SO WE CAN FACE IT BUT I THINK AUTO SET CAN BE SET UP BY THE COLLEGE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW HOW TO PREVENT. SUCH POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. DOCTOR WEBER. OKAY COULD THE YES I APPRECIATE THIS AND AND OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF OF FOOD INSECURITY AND. AND CAMPUSES IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ARE YOU SAYING BECAUSE ANNOUNCED OUT SLIGHTLY CONFUSED ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS WOULD BE CONTINGENT UPON. WHETHER NOT THE DORMITORIES HAD COOKING FACILITIES ARE NOT BECAUSE THIS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT IN THIS BILL SO. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NO NO NO WE ARE NOT REALLY FOCUSING UPON IN THE LIVING. FACILITIES WITH UP TO TEN FACILITATE ONE NOT THAT THOSE AT THE EXAMPLES CITED I'M A STUDENT HAPPENS TO LEAVE BUT EVEN. A IN A HOUSING UNIT SO WITH THE KITCHEN FACILITIES SO IF THAT'S SO. A LOT BUT THAT. THAT THAT THAT THAT'S A COLLEGE OR A INSTITUTIONALLY OWN THE FACILITIES THAT THEY HAVE NO. THEY DID TO TWO THINGS ARE ON I'M NOT EMPHASIZE SAID THAT IS TARA THE TRANSPARENCY PARENTS ARE. UP WOULD KNOW WHAT THE OUT. PAYING. AND THOSE. YOU KNOW WHAT. THEY THEY ARE IT. UP BY DIDN'T WANT BY OUT. GAY AND OUT WE ARE NOT THE FOCUSING UPON ANY UNITS SELL WITH FEE OF UP PUTTING FACILITIES WHY NOT. AND. WHAT IF IT FOR WITH THICK KNOTTED TO FISTS EDITED SO I MEAN THAT CAN THAT CAN BUY AND? AND. WITHOUT THAT TIM FACILITIES TO OBVIOUSLY FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF. I DON'T THINK ARE IN ALL MY ANTICIPATION IS THAT DATA. NEVER BE DRAMATIC CHANGE. BUT THE I THINK BY BY DOING THIS WAY A COTTAGES TO WOULD BE MORE. COST CONSCIOUS AND. LET THE OUR STUDENTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE WHAT THE OUTLYING INTO AND DONE ANY CALCULATION. FOR THE FOOD CONTRACTING DE WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST US SO IT IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THE HOUSING UNITS. A AND UP AGAINST OUR. THE MID SET THE PROFILE. OKAY. I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME. ROOM FOR OBVIOUSLY SAW MINUTES OF THIS IS SOMETHING BECAUSE I THINK THE DOCUMENT AT LEAST THE ONE I'M LOOKING AT SAYS THAT WE WOULD PROHIBIT. CITIES FROM ACQUIRING STUDENT HAVE A CAMPUS MEAL PLAN AS A CONDITION OF LIVING IN INSTITUTIONALLY OPERATE HOUSING SO I THINK THAT'S LIKE ACROSS THE BOARD VERSUS SAYING. IT UNLESS YOU IF YOU KNEW IT WAS ONLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE PLACES THAT THAT DUMB. BUT DON'T HAVE OR DOES IT DON'T HAVE COOKING FACILITIES OR WHATEVER THEN AND THIS THAT THEN APPLY THEM I MEAN. I I. BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY A STANDARD TO LOOK LIKE THAT EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE TO. REQUIRE UP HAVE TO GIVE STUDENTS THE OPTION OF HAVING A PLAN AND NO PLAN THAT'S WHAT THE STATE IS SO EVIDENTLY IF YOU. IF YOU ALTERING IT NOW AND SAYING ONLY IF THEY HAVE COOKING FACILITIES THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT. REALITY AND AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS MOST CAMPUSES AT YOU KNOW AND AND I'VE BEEN ON A BUNCH CAMPUSES BATTLE IS A FACULTY BUT. AS OF THE THINGS MOST CAMPUSES UP IN THE DORMITORY IN. LIVING KIND OF. AREA EVEN THE LARGE ONES HAVE A MULTITUDE OF OPTIONS STUDENTS I MEAN IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY DID BREAK OUT THE COST WHATEVER YOU COULD KIND OF FIGURED OUT TO SELL. BUT MOST OF THE TIME WE GO TO THESE CAMPUSES. THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF OPERATIONS AND AND OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS OF THAT ARE THERE AND BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE. OF THE LARGER CAMPUS IS NOT ALWAYS THE SMALLER ONES HAVE OF NEW FACILITIES NOT THAT HAVE KIND OF APARTMENT LIVING WITH WITH STUDENTS IN THE CIRCLE AND ALL THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF AS WELL AS SOME OTHER THINGS. AND THEN THEY HAVE SOME THE TRADITIONAL AREAS OF PEOPLE LIVE IN BECOMES DIFFICULT TO TRY TO MANDATE THAT THAT WE THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE A CERTAIN THING. ITEMSI FOUND CAMPUS AS TO BE ALMOST EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING NOW MUCH MORE WHEN I WITH THE COLLEGE YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T THERE WAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. BUT DID NOW WHEN I GO ON CAMPUS AS YOU FIND ALL KINDS OF LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND APARTMENTS AND. ALL THEY ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE PLANS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE LIKE ONE MEAL A DAY OR TWO MEALS A DAY OR WHATEVER. AND AND THE STUDENTS HAVE A TENDENCY TO FAMILIES PICK WHAT THEY THINK IS BEST AT THIS POINT BUT. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS CLEAR ENOUGH ABOUT. WHAT I WANT TO MANDATE THAT EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE TO SET THE SEPARATE HAVE AN OPTION TO HAVE A MEAL PLAN NO MEAL PLAN? BECAUSE I AB AS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE. YOU KNOW DORMS CAN GET TO BE SOME REALLY TRASHY PLACES IF YOU FELT STUDENTS TRYING TO COOK INTO MY BEEN AND BELONG TO PEOPLE AT THAT PLACE THAT WAS A DISASTER. SET THINGS ON FIRE. YOU KNOW TRIED TO COOK YOU KNOW BUGS AND STUFF RENDON EVERYWHERE YOU CAN IMAGINE A STUDENTS MAKING TACKLES IN A ROOM ONE TIME I MEAN JUST. ALL KINDS OF STUFF AND THAT YOU WOULD WANT IN A NORMAL LIVING CONDITION GIVEN THE CONDITIONS OF THE DORMITORY BEING A VERY SMALL ROOM SO. I'M NOT SURE IF I WANT TO MANDATE THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE OPTION OF NOT HAVING FOOD BECAUSE. I DON'T LET KIND OF PLAYS WITH THE THE OVERALL GENERAL PLAN THAT'S THERE BUT IF YOU. EXITING OUT THOSE OF THE PLACES THEM THAT'S NOT REALLY REFLECTED HERE AND THEN WHAT I'VE READ IS THE NARRATIVE YEAR. AND IF YOU INTEND TO OP THEM OUT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE. TO MAKE THE BILL A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN DORMITORIES AND NOWADAYS SO MANY. UNIVERSITIES SO TO OFFER MANY DEFEND ME AS IF TEN MAYOR SO TWENTY MINUTES OF THIRD ARMY OF WHATEVER SO. IT WOULD NOT SIMPLY. DISA AS SENSE OF THIS BIT LISTA OF GAVE THE STUDENT OPTION TO BUY IN LA OPT OUT THE. AND TO SPECIFY HOW MUCH BUT THE MERE PLANNED THE. OP BUYING IN NOT JUST THEM MANDATED THAT JUST BECAUSE HER ONE CHOICES TO LIVE UP. NOW IN THE CAMPUS OWNED A HOUSING THE MUTED PLANET SIDE NOT THE MANDATORY WITH THE NORMAL DEVIATION HOW MUCH IS IT ALL BUT THEY ARE SEPARATED A FULL HOUSE SINGLE WORD THEIR NAILS COOKING FACILITIES TO NO REFRIGERATION. OR OKAY ALSO A SO WE ARE WE ARE NOT FOCUSING UPON THE FACILITIES SO WITH IT. TING FACILITIES SARAH MANAGES ONE NOT THAT THAT'S SEVERE OPTION EVENING FOR WHICH YOU ARE COOKING AMENITIES SOME MAY CHOOSE TO BUY AND LITTLE SIMPLY GIVE THE OPTION TO THE STUDENTS SO IF THE. HAPPENED TO CHOOSE SO ABOVE THE TYPICAL FAT THEMSELVES STEP BECAUSE OF OUR. COOKING A MANIC TO SOUTH VALUABLE APARTMENT TYPE OF HOUSING. ARE UP BUT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE MANDATED THAT. SO WHAT COULD DISAPPEAR WAS SAW ARE NOT IDEA WAS TO PURPLE LISTA ARGUMENTS THE SET SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL TO GET USUALLY SO WE CAN GET A QUORUM. MEDINA PRESENT. BAKER.

A AND IT WAS MADE PERMANENT BY. PATRICK O'DONNELL SAID ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE. I SAY ALL OF THAT TO SAY THAT I THINK THE ISSUE OF DAHLE ENROLLMENT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LIMON FOR BRINGING IT TO ALL THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE. MY EXPERIENCE WITH LONG BEACH STUDENTS HAVE SHOWN A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS THE DUMA ROMAN OPENS UP ACCESS TO STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE COLLEGE GOING EXPERIENCES. THE SECOND THING IS THAT I REALIZE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO INFORM STUDENTS PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF DUAL ENROLLMENT. IN LONG BEACH OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN COLLEGE GOING RATES TO BOTH LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE AND CAL STATE LONG BEACH. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WHILE WE'RE STILL GATHERING DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DOOM ENROLLMENT IN THESE INCREASES. IT IS THE OLD ALIGNMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAS ALLOWED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO CONNECT WITH INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. WHEN I VISIT HIGH SCHOOLS TO TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT COLLEGE. WHEN I IT SPECIFICALLY A TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE ETHNIC STUDIES DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES THAT WE OFFER FROM CAL STATE LONG BEACH TO LONG BEACH UNIFIED. IT HELPS THEM CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH COLLEGE FACULTY. A COLLEGE PERSONNEL AND IT HELPS DEMYSTIFY THE COLLEGE PROCESS FOR THEM. I ALSO WORK WITH HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHER SITE ADMINISTRATORS TO HELP DEMYSTIFY THAT PROCESS AS WELL. OF THESE BENEFITS ECHO SOME OF THE RESEARCH UNDERGONE ROMAN WHICH SHOWS THAT. IT IMPROVE STUDENT'S COLLEGE READINESS. IN IT INCREASES THEIR POST SECONDARY ACCESS AND PERSISTENCE. AND THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT OUR RATES OF COLLEGE COMPLETION ARE INCREASING AS WELL. THE STUDENTS I TALKED TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE INCREASED THEIR MOTIVATION TO ATTEND COLLEGE. AND IT GIVES THEM A TASTE OF WHAT COLLEGES LIKE. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY TESTIMONY. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BRUCE BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY CLEANERS. SEEING NONE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THINK FOR ALLOW E TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TODAY. AS WE KNOW GROWING STUDENT OUT FOR RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES IS A CONCERNING ISSUE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE. MUST CONTINUE TO ADDRESS VINCE IS SUPER COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS FOUND OUT THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENT DEBT FOR A CALIFORNIA GRADUATE AT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES IS. FIFTY FOUR PERCENT A WITH THE TOTAL DEBT AVERAGE OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GRADUATE STUDENT. STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES OFTEN PROVIDE RECENT GRADUATES WITH THE SIX MONTH GRACE PERIOD BEFORE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BEGAN THEIR LOAN REPAYMENT. HOWEVER SIX MONTHS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR RECENT GRADUATES WERE OFTEN FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES ENTERING THE WORKFORCE AND ADJUSTING TO POST COLLEGE LIFE. THIS IS ALSO INSUFFICIENT TIME TO CONSIDER THEIR CAREER OPTIONS AND MAJOR LIFE EXPERIENCES SUCH AS PURCHASING A HOME PERHAPS MARRIAGE OR STARTER STARTING A FAMILY. BEFORE HAVING TO TAKE ON THIS HERCULEAN TASK OF REPAINT OUR OF STUDENT LOANS. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE UP TO TWO YEARS OF DEBT RELIEF FOR FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS TO RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. IT REPLICATES AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK THIS BILL WILL BE A PROVIDE OUR GRADUATES WITH MORE TIME. TO GIVE THEM TO PAY THE DOCTOR FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS AND ALSO ADDRESS ARE CRITICAL NEED AYE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIR ARE MEDINA AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GERRY JERVIS AGAIN FOR THE CALISTO. TELL STATE SENATOR FEARS AND. THANK YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WANNA TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR THAT CALIFORNIA KICKSTART MY FUTURE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMBY SPEAKING ABOUT THE EQUITY ISSUES REGARDING WHO NEEDS TO TAKE OUT DEBT IN THE CSU. AND POTENTIALLY A CHAIN AYE AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO LOAN SUBSIDY AND FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM LIKE THE CSU OUR TUITION IS AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY AND WHERE NEARLY TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE STUDENTS DO NOT PAY TUITION AT ALL DUE TO A COMBINATION OF SYSTEM. STATE AND FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS MANY ASSUME THAT IT CSU DEGREE AS AFFORDABLE YET FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS CONTINUE TO FACE VERY REAL CHALLENGE AS. YEAH AFFORDING ALL OF THE COST NECESSARY TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE DEBT BURDENS THAT FALL MORE HEAVILY ON UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN THE CSU. THE CELTICS IN ASSOCIATION IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CUTS THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS PUBLISHED REPORT LAST YEAR WHICH INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE OF WHICH STUDENTS HOLD THAT IN THE CSU. IT FOUND THAT NEARLY EATEN TEN STUDENTS WITH A BACHELORS DEGREE WHO BORROWED HAD FAMILY INCOMES NO GREATER THAN FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY WHILE FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF WHITE STUDENTS HAD THAT WHEN THEY GRADUATED FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF HISPANIC AND LATINO GRADUATES. GUY DOT AND SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS GRADUATED WITH THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE AVERAGE IN THE CSU FOR GRADUATES IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THIS REPORT SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU SLICE A NUMBER THE DEBT WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. FOR THIS REASON ALONE A PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE CREATED BY AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO GIVE THE STUDENTS A BETTER FINANCIAL RELIEF. SO THAT HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD NOT BE SADDLED WITH THE DEBT THEY CAN. POTENTIALLY BE STRUGGLING TO PAY OFF FOR THE REST THEIR LIVES ADDITIONALLY OUR ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO NEED TO TAKE OUT LOANS. OR WHO HAVE DEBTS. CURRENTLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND PROPOSING THERE FOR FY NINETEEN BUDGET ARE PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. AND ELIMINATION OF ALL SUBSIDIZED LOANS FOR UNDERGRADUATES ELIMINATION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM AND ELIMINATING FEDERAL WORK STUDY FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS. ALL OF THESE CHANGES IF UP IMPLEMENTED WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT LOANS TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION AND GRADUATES WHO HOLD THAT. IN ADDITION WE DO HAVE A ALSO DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE A LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR STUDENT BORROWERS AND DEBT HOLDERS. EVEN THOUGH STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING TO FILL THIS NEW GAP WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO LOOKING TO PREEMPT STATES FROM BEING ABLE TO REGULATE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE STUDENT LOANS. ALL OF THESE CHANGES AN IMPACT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SHOW HOW ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL A PROGRAM LIKE THE CALIFORNIA KICKSTART MY LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER TO PROVIDE A LEVEL RELIEF AND PROTECTION FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY TWEETERS. BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ONE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEE NOTE WIENERS. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. KILEY. SO YOUR ON YOU YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE A SIX MONTH GRACE PERIOD THROUGH THE FEDERAL STERN ONE. PROGRAM I BUT WE NEED TO THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME RIGHT. SO I GUESS ONE APPROACH THAT WE COULD TAKE IS THE STATE COULD STEP IN AND TRY TO EXTEND THAT GRACE PERIOD. EITHER BY ASSUMING WHATEVER THE. PAINFUL OF THE INTEREST IS OR PERHAPS SOMETHING EVEN BE NEGOTIATED. WITH THAT WITH PROVIDERS UNDER THIS IS TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND HAVING THE STATE IS KIND OF STEP IN. AND AND MAKE THE PAYMENTS ITSELF I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU OPTED TO GO THAT DIRECTION IS THAT THE WAY NEW YORK HAS A FOR EXAMPLE. THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE. THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SO WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS OPTION IS A WASTE HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE RELIEVED DOT. DOT. RIGHT BUT THE IDEA IS TO EXTEND THE GRACE PERIOD AND SO I'M WONDERING. IF THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO DO THAT WITHOUT THE STATE JUST TAKING ON. THAT THE PAYMENTS ITSELF. I DO HAVE YOU EXPLORE THAT OPTION WELL IT'S CERTAINLY A MEASURE WE CAN LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE. OKAY. YOU GUYS I THINK I DON'T NOT WHITE THAT THIS APPROACH MIGHT BE PREFERABLE. OBVIOUSLY A GRACE PERIOD IS IS IS VALUABLE BUT ON THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE INTERESTS THAT A STUDENT HAS TO PAY I THINK FROM FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE THE IDEA OF RELIEVING SOME OF THAT DEBT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO STUDENTS. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I DO NOT BUT I JUST WANT SOME CLARIFICATION. THE. SO FORWARD. TWO YEARS WE WOULD MAKE THE PAYMENT. IS THAT RIGHT FOR UP TO TWENTY FORM OF THE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS A AFTER HOW LONG GENERAL YOU THAT A LOAN DEBT IS WHAT HOW MANY PARKING HOW MANY YEARS. TEN YEARS. IT WOULD DEPEND I MEAN THE AVERAGE DEBT LOAD OF ITS IF YOU SEE IN THIS AROUND SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THING SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES ON THE PAY THAT BACK. OKAY OKAY SO. I'LL BUT GENERALLY THEY'RE GIVEN A AND INCOME PAYMENT KIND OF SITUATION SO IT PROBABLY IS A SMALL AMOUNT THAT WOULD PAY. FOR THEM IS THAT CORRECT PROBABLY SO SO THE IT'S BASED OFF OF INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE SO. INDIVIDUALS A MAKE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM OKAY THEY MAKE THE OVER FIFTY NOT THEIR PARENTS WHICH ONE IS IT IT'S. THEM THEM SO THEY IN TERMS OF JOB OKAY SO THAT. NOT IT'S NOT THE PAYMENT BACK OF THIS. DOES THIS GO AND BACK INTO THE FUND THE SOMEONE SAID IT MAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT LOW DOES IT OR DOES IT NOT. THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK AROUND WITH YOU OKAY. OKAY I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING YEAH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS WE GO ALONG WITH THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES TO LOOK AT IT AND. SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY OPERATES CLEARLY WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT HELPED OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IN DEBT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT THOSE WHO CAN PAY TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND PAY YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF THINGS SO I LOOK FORWARD. SEEING HOW IT ROLLSOUT IN TERMS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEES SO THANK YOU. SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IS OUR MOTION. WELL THE BILL. MOVE BY DOCTOR WEBER SECOND BY MISS QUIRK SILVA. THE MOTION BEFORE US IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER NO ARAMBULA BLOOM. BLOOM AYE SCHABAS IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY. KILEY NO LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW PATTERSON. PATTERSON NO QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE WEBER. WEBER I. SEVEN THREE YOUR BILL IS UP. NEXT. ITEM THREE AND SIX MISTER CALDERON. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M GONNA BE STARTING. WITHOUT. EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT. ITEM THREE. MAYBE GET ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CURRENTLY CREATES THE FINANCIAL AID SHOPPING SHE. ALSO KNOWN JUST AS A SHOPPING SHEET THAT SCHOOLS CAN VOLUNTARY LEAH DOT TO COMMUNICATE FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS. THE SHOPPING SHEET IS A CONSUMER TOOL DESIGNED TO NOTIFY STUDENTS ABOUT A TERMINATION. ABOUT A UNIVERSITIES GRADUATION RATES LOAN DEFAULT RATES. ASKED IT YET THE LOAN DEFAULT RATES IN MEDIAN STUDENT BORROWING. UP THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE ALL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO USE THE SHOPPING SHEET WHEN COMMUNICATING FINANCIALLY PACKAGES TO STUDENTS. WHEN THE INSTITUTE OF FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS EXAMINED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FINANCIAL AID LETTERS. ARE AWARD LETTERS THAT UNIVERSITIES CREATED THEY FOUND A SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF THOSE LETTERS DECEITFULLY GROUPED ALL THE SOURCES OF A TOGETHER WITH NO DISTINCTION FOR WHAT WAS REQUIRED TO BE PAID BACK. AND WHAT WAS A GIFT THIS TACTIC HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR STATE INTERVENTION TO ENSURE. BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION IS PROVIDED FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ALSO STIPULATES THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING EX SUCCESSOR DOCUMENT TO THE SHOPPING SHEET IF IT IS DISCONTINUED OR CHANGED. THIS IS IMPORTANT CASE ANOTHER DEPARTMENT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MINT BEGINS MAINTAINING THIS LETTER IN THE NAME OF THE LETTER IS CHANGE OR IF IT IS ENTIRELY DISCONTINUED. WITHOUT UNIFORM FINANCIALLY LETTER STUDENTS WASTE TIME DECODING AND COMPARING FINANCIALLY PACKAGES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND DATA OR ARE PURPOSEFULLY DECEITFUL. THIS IS WHAT THAT LETTER LOOKS LIKE. ESSENTIALLY JUST A PIECE OF PAPER WHERE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FILL IN THE BLANKS RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FORCE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES TO FILL THIS OUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES REQUIRES THAT THEY FILL THIS OUT. TO GIVE STUDENTS A PROPER SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES GONNA BE. ARE AND YOU KNOW IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES THEY DISCONTINUED THIS LETTER OR YOU KNOW IT MOVES TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT OR THEY CHANGE SOME ASPECT OF IT. THEN IT IS UPON THE FINANCIALLY COMMISSION ARE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO DETERMINE THAT SUCCESSOR ALSO THAT'S REALLY ALL THIS BILL DOES AND IT'S ALL IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO ALLOW STUDENTS AN IDEA. OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO FACE ARE WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS IN THEIR DEBT PAYMENTS SO THAT THEY. THEY CAN BETTER ASSESS WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO GET THEMSELVES INTO SO THE NOT PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION THAT THEY CAN'T HANDLE OUT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF COLLEGE OR THAT LEASE THAT THEY'RE GOING INTO. THEIR FINANCIAL OUT MEANS AND AND WHAT THAT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT THEIR EDUCATION IS GOING TO COST HIM WITH EYES WIDE OPEN RATHER THAN IT BEING UP PURPOSEFULLY. AB MISDIRECTED OR NOT GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION. AND YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A BETTER DECISION OP I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME. ARE TODAY I HAVE A MOUSA BARTOS AND BRANDON BY KURT FROM THE CALIFORNIA TO NAY COMMISSION TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THE COMMISSION. I'M MELISSA BARDO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION A SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND EARLIER WHERE DEATH THROUGH UTILIZATION OF THE FINANCIALLY CHOPPING SHE. ON COLLEGE COSTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AT THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED THAT MANY CAMPUSES ALREADY USED THE FINANCIALLY CHOPPING SHE PRIMARILY TO INFORM BETTER AND ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE THINK THAT THE FINANCIALLY CHOPPING SHE CAN BE YOU THAT THE COUPLE MET FOR A BROADER COMMUNICATION EFFORT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD IDENTIFY A THICK THE THIRD DOCUMENT IN THE FUTURE. WE WOULD CERTAINLY WORK CLOBBER DELUDE LEAVE WHAT AFFECT MET REPRESENTATIVE THROUGH A BOARD THAT THE COMMISSION RUNS THE FINANCIAL AID ADVISORY BOARD. I'M AND ALSO WITH THE COMMISSION ITSELF WHICH HAD REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH SEGMENT. I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SYNDICATE STAY ON BEHALF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE NOT SENATOR OFFICIAL. ON A SUPPORT LETTER BUT WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT. CHARGER SO TELL SEATS IN ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANY TWEENER. OPPOSITION. TO A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. MISTER JUST MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX. WE PROVIDE THE SHEET WE HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE. PROBLEM PROBLEM IS HOW THE MEASURE IS WORDED. SECTION ONE AND TWO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IDENTICAL HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION ONE LINE EIGHT. THERE IS NO COMMA AFTER THE WORD EDUCATION. SECTION TWO WINE EIGHT THERE IS A CALM THAT COMIC CHANGES THE INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE. SUPPOSED TO BE IDENTICAL WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT CAN GO BACK TO THAT PLEASE SHARE FORCE. SECTION ONE LINE EIGHT AFTER THE WORD EDUCATION THERE IS NO COM ON ON THE FIRST PAGE OR AND I NAY LOOKIN. SECOND PAGE. SECTION. LINE WHAT. MY LINE EIGHT AFTER THE WORD EDUCATION THERE IS NO COM. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CORRECT. PAGES DEBRIS LINE EIGHT AFTER THE WORD EDUCATION THERE IS A COM. THAT CHANGES THE INTENT WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS NOW IS THE STUDENT EIGHT COMMISSION HAS THE DISCRETION TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR AT THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. WE HAVE SEE FACT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER. MY CLIENTS WE DON'T TAKE CAL GRANTS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE. THEREFORE THIS NOTION AND IT'S REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS OF GIVING SEE SACKED THE AUTHORITY TO CHOOSE A DOCUMENT EVEN FROM A NON GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY THAT'S WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS. IS. DISCONCERTING FROM MY CLIENT IF THE INTENT IS THAT THIS BE FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT YOU PUT IT DOWN. I ITEM DEVELOPED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITHOUT WERE ALL GOOD BUT NOW IT'S NEBULOUS. WE DON'T PARTICIPATING THE OF THE BOARD'S REFERENCE POLICY SACK SWEEP ACTUALLY HAVE NO INPUT. IF THEY SELECTED SOMETHING FROM TKS OR A NON GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY AGAIN IF THE INTENT IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE DOCUMENT WHICH CHANGED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION JUST SAY A DOCUMENT DEVELOP A US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING. I AM AND IF I MAY RESPOND FIRST OF ALL THE COMMON THINGS IN THERE THAT'S JUST NEW TO RIGHT NOW AND WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER PIECE. I AM HAPPY TO WORK ON ALL THE COMMENTS YOU WANT BUT WITH REGARDS TO. YOU KNOW. THE OTHER PIECE YEAH I MEAN EVEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT THE INTENT IS NOT TO HAVE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CREATE A NEW SHOPPING SHE BUT RATHER AUTHORIZED STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO IDENTIFY. A SUCCESSOR DOCUMENT THAT MAY BE DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR ANOTHER ENTITY ANOTHER SLT SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WHAT THEY COULD GET RID OF IT ALL ENTIRELY OF THAT THAT'S IT THAT BUT THAT PUT US IN A POSITION WHERE NOW WE HAVE NOTHING FOR STUDENTS. OUGHT TO GIVE THEM THAT IT UP PROPER SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THE FUTURE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE TIMES FINANCIALLY AND SO I THINK. BY DEFINITION OR BY REASON YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENT OR ANOTHER ENTITY CREATE SOMETHING I AND SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORK THESE ISSUES WITH YOU. AYE AGAIN BECOME A THING THAT'S NEW TO ME HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT BOTH REGARDS I MEAN I THINK IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AS WELL AS. MINNOW LOGICALLY AND THEN ALSO AS A STATE IN THE BILL AS ALSO I NOTED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THERE. NOW THERE'S A COMMON ONE SECTION IN NOT IN THE OTHER BOTH TO BE IDENTICAL LANGUAGE BY ADEQUATE COM. I LIKE. AND SPEAKING I GOT A LETTER RIGHT HERE. PER WEEK. OF COURSE. SENATE SENTENCE STRUCTURE. IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION ONE. IT'S ALL ONE SENTENCE. SO AGE SHOPPING SHEET AS DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR SUCCESSOR. SECTION TWO. DEVELOPED BY UNITED STATES PART OF EDUCATION KARMA OR. EXACERBATE UNIT. CREATE TWO INDEPENDENT SENTENCES THERE IN THERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME THING BUT IT IS NOT. YEAH I GUESS IF I HAD IT WORK A CHAIR I JUST AVOIDED AYE. AND I WANT UNDERSTAND THE CALM AND SO YOUR VIEW IS. WHY DOES THAT NEW STRUCTURE A IN WHAT WAY IS THAT YOU STRUCTURE ALTER THE I LIKELY HAVE MEANING WE BELIEVE THAT IT COULD BE CONSTRUED IN SECTION TWO THAT SEE SACK COULD? SELECT THE DOCUMENT AT THEIR SOLE DISCRETION WEARS IN SECTION ONE IT'S INTENDED TO ALL BE A RUN ON IT'S A DOCUMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR SUCCESSOR. YOUR CREW <u><c.green>.</c></u> BUT AT THE OR SUCCESSOR DOCUMENTS SO I DON'T SEE HOW THAT GETS YOU AND YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. WITH THAT THAT'S CORRECT WE WOULD PREFER SPECIFICITY AND IN FACT NOW THAT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON REYES THAT IF IT SAYS ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. IT'S FINE IT'S A NON GOVERNMENTAL WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES I SO TO THE EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR ANOTHER GOVERNMENT YOU FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT RESOLVES OUR ISSUE WORK GOT MORE THAN HAPPY TO AFTER WORK ON THAT ISSUE I MEAN. AND HIS OFFICE IS BEEN VERY RESPOND A AYE AGAIN THAT THAT HAD NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED BEFORE SPECIFIC TO VOTE AND TOTALING WAS BECAUSE THE COMMA BUT WITH REGARDS TO THIS OTHER ISSUE. I WILL MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THAT ISSUE MOVING FORWARD. THEN AND AGAIN I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ME PRETTY WELL I'M ONE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYBODY FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET. AS MUCH CONSENSUS AS POSSIBLE SO LONG AS IT'S A GOVERNMENT ENTITY DEVELOPING THIS DOCUMENT. FINE. IT'S JUST. YEAH IT HAPPENED ON FLOOR ALL THE OPTIONS WITH THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WEBSTER LIVING YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. SOBRE CALDERON FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL SICK GOOD BILL GREAT INTENTION.

MOVED BY THIS QUIRK SILVA SECOND BY MISTER LEVINE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA I'VE. MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE ARAMBULA BLOOM. BLOOM I SHOP IS CURRENT IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE THE WIEN. LEVINE I LOW PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE WEBER. WEBER I. ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT AND WILL MOVE TO ITEM SIX. IF YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OFF FIRST I WANT TO ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND ONE THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK IS ALSO CHAIR. OF THIS BILL REQUIRES ARE AB NINETEEN NINETY EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE REQUIRES PARTICIPATING UC AND CSU CAMPUSES TO CREATE PROCEDURES FOR INCOME BASED REPAYMENT PLANS FOR DREAM LOANS. DREAM LOANS HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND HAVE FINANCIAL NEED AT UC AND CSU CAMPUSES AFFORD EDUCATIONALLY RELATED EXPENSES CURRENTLY STUDENTS ONLY OPTION TO REPAY THEIR DREAM LOANS. WITH EQUAL PAYMENTS OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD ARE WITH PEOPLE PAYMENTS OVER TENURE PERIOD. UNDER AN INCOME BASED REPAYMENT PLAN A STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT IS BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. MORE PER PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE UNCERTAINTY AROUND DHAKA HAS LEAD TO TREPIDATION AMONG THE STUDENTS ABOUT TAKING OUR DREAMLAND STUDENTS TAKING OUT DREAM LOANS ARE NOT CONFIDENT. THEY HAVE THEY CAN BE LAWFULLY EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES HAMPERING THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THESE LOANS. STUDENT WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT REPAYING A DREAM LOAN MAY BE DISSUADED FROM PURSUING A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE OR NONPROFIT WORK DO TO LOW ENTRY LEVEL PAY. LATINO STUDENTS WHO ARE THE PRIMARY RECIPIENTS OF DREAM LOANS. EXPERIENCE HISTORIC WAGE DISCRIMINATION THIS WAGE DISPARITY MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO REPAY LOANS ON A STANDARD REPAYMENT PLAN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUALITY BY CREATING AN INCOME BASED REPAYMENT PLAN FOR DREAM LOANS ARE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES COMMUNICATE THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THEIR DOCUMENTED PEERS TO PURSUE. AN EDUCATION KNOWING THEY CAN FLEXIBLE THEY CAN HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO REPAY THEIR LOANS UPON GRADUATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND AND I WILL SAY. THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH. WITH THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE STUDENTS TO ACCEPT THESE LOANS. AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW WITH THAT WITH WITH THE PROGRAM. ARE INCOME BASED REPAYMENT PROGRAM IS WHAT'S FAIR AND IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO OUR TO PUT INTO LAW CODIFIED INTO LAW OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE DOCUMENTED THAT HAVE STUDENT LOANS. THEY CAN APPLY AND GET A A. UP INCOME BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NEW THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS YOU KNOW A DOCUMENT STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO AS WELL THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY CAN PUBLIC IMPLYING GET THE SAME STATUS. SO I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR ARE YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN CREATE THE SAME STANDARDS FOR THE STUDENTS OUR DREAM ONCE AGAIN MANY OF WHOM. NO NO OTHER HOME OTHER THAN THIS COUNTRY OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA I HAVE A FRIEND. SIX MONTHS OLD BROUGHT HERE KNOWS NO OTHER HOME. TOLD GO BACK TO MEXICO HE SAYS WHERE I'VE NEVER LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE SO I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE IMPLEMENT SOME LIKE THIS IT'S REALLY SMALL BUT IT GOES A LONG WAY TO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ITS IN ITS FAIR. AYE AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS IN A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY WE STUDENTS ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING BAD NEWS. THINKING RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY AND SUPPORT IS JUST YOU RYAN WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JESSE RYAN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WE ARE A BROAD BASED BIPARTISAN COALITION OF BUSINESS CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. SOLELY DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS GETTING INTO AND SUCCEEDING IN COLLEGE. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT IS PROUDLY BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS WERE ALSO HOME TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND AN ESTIMATED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. CURRENTLY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR ANY FORM OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID NOT ONLY GRANTS BUT ALSO WORK STUDY IN STUDENT LOANS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS HAVE LACKED THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS ON THE SAME TERMS AS THEIR PEERS WHO CAN ACCESS MORE AFFORDABLE REPAYMENT OR EVEN LOAN FORGIVENESS OPTIONS? THROUGH AB FIVE FORTY IN THE DREAM ACT CALIFORNIA HAS ALLOWED MANY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO QUALIFY FOR IN STATE TUITION RATES AND MOST STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS EXCLUDING THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS. WITH SENATOR LAURA'S LEADERSHIP WE SAW THAT CALIFORNIA ALSO ESTABLISHED THE DREAM LOAN PROGRAM TO PAIR STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL DOLLARS TO PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AT THE CSU YOU SEE. WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS STUDENT LOANS ON REASONABLE TERMS. FOLLOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ELECTION UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS GREW WORRIED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO BE EDUCATED. BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY STATUS AND WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABILITY TO AFFORD COLLEGE. THE CAMPAIGN HAS HEARD FROM MANY OF THE STUDENTS AND OUR PARTNERS SERVING THE STUDENTS ON CAMPUSES THAT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT INCURRING DEBT TO COVER COLLEGE EXPENSES. AND THEY'RE UNSURE OF THEIR ABILITIES SECURE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IN THE U. S. AFTER GRADUATING. INCOME BASED REPAYMENT WHICH WE HEARD A ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON SPEAK SO ELOQUENTLY OF IS SOMETHING THAT I AM A BENEFICIARY OF THE SOMETHING THAT MY HUSBAND IS CURRENTLY TAKING ADVANTAGE UP WITHOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD STAY AFLOAT. WE KNOW THAT ALL STUDENTS DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PREDICTABLE AFFORDABLE MEANS OF PAIN BACK WITHOUT DEFAULTING ON LOANS AND WITHOUT INCURRING HIGHER PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH. FURTHERMORE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE WORK JUST AS HARD TO EARN A SPOT AT THE CSU IN UC SHOULD NOT NEED TO DROP OUT DUE TO COST. THE STUDENTS ARE FACING CHALLENGES THAT MANY OF US FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE. FORTUNATELY WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE. THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR COLLEGE SHOULD NEVER OUT WAY NEVER OUT WAY STUDENTS ABILITY. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL STUDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO DREAM LOANS IN INCOME BASED REPAYMENT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JERRY SO CAL STATES IN ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MANY RODRIGUEZ FROM THE EDUCATION TRUST LAST YEAR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I ALEX GREAT CSU WHERE WE'RE GONNA TWEENER WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AND I WE'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE.

ASSURANCE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO INTO. THERE ARE GOING TO DEFAULT ON THEIR LOAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AYE WE ALSO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM REMAINS SELF SUSTAINABLE AFTER A CAMPUSES IN THE FUTURE SO WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND NEXT WE WILL GO TO. I. FIVE. DOCTOR WEBER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT YOU A. B. EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR. A BILL RELATING TO STOOP STUDENT FOOD INSECURITY IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES. UP MOST OF YOU'VE HEARD THE DATA BEFORE IN TERMS OF HOW OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT OUR SCHOOLS OF. BASICALLY OF MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HUNGRY HELD A LACK THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BALANCED MEALS. AND IT VARIES WITH THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS WHERE. SEE ISSUE WAS ABOUT FORTY ONE PERCENT OF AND THESE. AND WITH THAT AS WELL AS TEN PERCENT OF THE C. ISSUE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD. OF RECENT SURVEY AT THE WILL OF THE WISCONSIN HOPE LEFT FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF THE FOUR THOUSAND RECIPIENTS. I RESPONDED TO EXCUSE ME AT THE TEN COMMITTEE CLOUDS ACROSS NATION FACED FROM SOME FORM OF STUDENTS. FOOD INSECURITY UP MAYBE AWARE OF A PREVIOUS BILLS WE PASS IN THIS HOUSE AND EVEN LESS YOU SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. I WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THAT REQUIRES UNIVERSE IN BECAUSE THE PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COUNTIES CAL FURNITURE REGISTRARTE PROGRAM. IT'S INTERESTING AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF. UP FOOD INSECURITY THAT EVERY TIME WE THINK WE'VE A SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THE LOAN CROPS UP THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WE COME BACK AND DO ADDITIONAL WORK. WE'VE DONE THREE BILL SO FAR THAT HAVE BASICALLY DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF FOOD INSECURITY THAT BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW. A EIGHTEEN THIS BILL EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR WILL FURTHER IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL ANTI HUNGER BENEFITS. CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOMES COLLEGE STUDENTS BY ONE EXPANDING THE CAL FRENCH RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM TO ALLOW ALL SEE ISSUE LOCATIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT. THERE COUNTY HAS CHOSEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM FOR THE NON STUDENT POPULATION. CURRENTLY ONLY NINE COUNTIES PARTICIPATE IN THEM A RESTAURANT OF MEAL PROGRAM LEAVING OUT TNC ISSUES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM SO WHAT THIS DOES BASICALLY IS THAT EMPOWERS THE STUDENT WHO. ARE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAO FRESH UP MAYBE COMING FROM AN AREA WHERE THEY HAVE CALPERS PROGRAMS I ALL OF A SUDDEN TO ARRIVE AT A CAMPUS THAT DOESN'T HAVE ONE IN THEIR COUNTY. AND IT GIVES THE CAMPUS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO USE THEIR CAL FRESH ON MY CAMPUS FOR THEIR RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM. UP TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR IS JENNIFER MCGUIRE WHOSE ASSIST A PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL WORK AT HUMBOLDT STATE. AND ELLEN VAULT VOLUNTARY WHO'S THE LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR FOOD RESEARCH AND ACTION CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS FOR INVITING ME HERE TO SPEAK UPON ABOUT THIS RESEARCH. SO I M. THOUGH CO. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE CSU BASIC NEEDS STUDY THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW. AND THAT MY RIGHT I DO. EXCUSE ME MICHAEL REESE RESEARCHERS AFTER SHE TO CRUTCHFIELD WHO IS FROM LONG BEACH STATE. AND SO DOCTOR WEBER THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THAT THE PREVALENCE THAT WE SEE IN FOOD INSECURE OR FOR PUTTING SECURING HOMELESS STUDENTS. AND I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING. ON IN REGARDS TO ACADEMICS THOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE FOOD IN SECURING HOMELESS WERE THEIR GPAS WERE LOWER THEIR ACADEMIC CONCERNS WERE HIGHER. AND IN REGARDS TO THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IBM REPORTED MORE DAYS WHERE THEY WERE EXPERIENCING AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR THOSE. AND WHEN WE LOOK THAT STUDENTS WHO WERE VERY LOW FOOD SECURE SO THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO WERE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HUNGER. AND ALSO. WITH THAT HUNGER ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING I. THINK THEM THAT GO ALONG WITH IT SUCH AS FEELING WEAK HAVING TROUBLE CONCENTRATING. AND HAVING TROUBLE SHOWING UP TO SCHOOL WE SAW THAT THERE LOW FOOD IN SECURING HOMELESS STUDENTS MISSED DOUBLE THE DAYS ARM. OF SCHOOL OR WORK OR SHOWING UP TO THE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AS THEIR FOOD AND HOUSING SECURE COUNTERPARTS. AND SO WE KNOW WE HAVE A HOST OF AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE EMERGING ON CAMPUSES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WE KNOW THERE'S NOT A SINGLE SOLVE FOR THESE ISSUES FOR HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS. BUT THE RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM WILL HELP PUT FOOD INTO THE HANDS OF STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO STORE OR PREPARE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE HOMELESS AND SO I THINK THIS IS A. REALLY GOOD BILL AND I COMMEND DOCTOR WEBER FOR WRITING IN THE COMMITTEE HOPEFULLY FOR SUPPORTING IT. I'LL JUST SAY THAT ABILITY VOLUNTEER WITH THE FOOD RESEARCH AND ACTION CENTER NATIONAL AYE DONE URBANIZATION. BASED IN DC AND WE ARE HONORED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR WE KNOW OF THE VERY TREMENDOUS STRIDES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HERE IS MADE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MADE. ON COLLEGE HUNGER AND DO SEE THIS UP AS AN ADDITIONAL STEP THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PARTICULARLY FOR HOMELESS COLLEGE STUDENTS TO HAVE THE ACCESS AND REALLY APPLAUD AT THE FACT THAT DOES SEE IF YOU WOULD WANT TO STAND UP AND DO THIS SO. A WEEK LEARJET I. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SYNDICATE STILL BEHALF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CAMINO COLLEGES AND STRONG SUPPORT.

YOU KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE AT PRESENT STATE AS WELL AND I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT IT IF I COULD DO OUR FIRST LADY MARY CASTRO WHO REALLY HAS WORKED. DILIGENTLY TO OPEN UP A FOOD PANTRY BUT BECAUSE OF THE HEAT ON OUR CAMPUS WE'VE SERVED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS FIFTY THOUSAND MEALS. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND SO I DID SEE ONE YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO CLONE MISS CASTRO BUT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU GUYS CONSIDER. YOU KNOW SHE SHE DID HAVE A NAP THAT WHAT WHEN THEY'RE CLOSING UP AN EVENT AT FRESNO STATE THEY THEN NOTIFY STUDENTS AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN COME AND EAT BEFORE. THEY CLOSE THAT EVENT THAT MAY BE SOMETHING FURTHER DOWN THE LINE YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TO INCORPORATE A SEVERAL OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE THAT NOW THERE WAS A FOODS OF STUDENT NEED FOOD INSECURITY CON. CONFERENCE HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT I SPOKE AT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. AND THAT THAT AT WAS BROUGHT OUT IT AND SEVERAL OF THE CAMPUSES NOW HAVE THESE APPS BECAUSE THEY. KNOW CAMPUS HAS A PARTY THE PRESIDENT HAS A PARTY IS CHICKEN WINGS MEATBALLS AND WHATEVER PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN WALK AWAY. AND NOW THEY PUT IT PUT ON AT THAT THE RECEPTION IS OPEN YOU COME GET THE FOOD. AND SO THE STUDENTS COME AND EAT GET THE FOCUS LEFT OVER SO THEY HAVE THAT NOW AT SEVERAL CAMPUSES. ARE AS WELL AS SOME DORMS ON SOME CAMPUS I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT THE STUDENTS HAVE DONE. OF THEY HAVE OF THE FARGO SOMEHOW HUMANITY THAN WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THEY JUST OPEN IT UP TO THOSE IN NEED AND THEY WORK SO HARD FOR THEIR PANTRIES. UP BUT THEY ALSO AT THE IF IT'S ACT STATE AND SOME OF THE CAMPUS HAVE SET ASIDE TEN ROOMS IN THE DORMS. THE KIDS WERE HOMELESS AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS. TO GET THEMSELVES OF ORGANIZED TO FIND A PLACE TO STAY AND GET THE NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT SO THEY HAVE THE AT SAKS THE BAY OF TEN ROOM TO SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE IDENTIFIED DORM ROOMS. THAT THEY WILL LOVE LET THE STUDENTS STAY IN FOR THIRTY DAYS WHILE THEY'RE AT SO THEY WILL NOT BE ON THE STREETS. AND DOT AND AND SO IT'S REALLY BEEN AMAZING TO SEE HOW THE STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN THIS. AND PUT A TREMENDOUS NEED IS ON OUR CAMPUSES THAT PLACES THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WOULD HAVE AS MUCH UP FOOD INSECURITY HOMELESSNESS THAT'S THERE. BUT A LOT OF IT IS COMING FROM A STUDENTS AND I'M SURE IT FRESNO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FRESNO AND.

HOW WE ARE ONLY ONE OF TWO STATES THAT DOES NOT HAVE ACCORDINGLY ENTITY WITH RESPECT HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE? CONVERSATIONS OCCURRING SO THAT WE CAN BEST PLAN ACCORDINGLY WITH THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS AND SO. WITH RESPECT TO ASK HER AYE VOTE AND WITH ME IN SUPPORT IT WITH CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS MONDAY A HUSSY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME OF LAWNDALE JESS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMPETES. WHEN INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT AIMED AT BOLSTERING THE STATE'S POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. TO FOSTER A ROBUST ECONOMY VIBRANT COMMUNITIES AND ENGAGED CITIZENRY. I'M HERE AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF MR LOS BILL AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CALIFORNIA COMPETES OF LONG SUPPORTED GREATER OVERSIGHT IN COORDINATION FOR CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT ONCE HE PACKWOOD'S DEFUNDED AND EFFECTIVELY DISSOLVED IN TWENTY ELEVEN IT OCCURRED AT THE TIME OF HIGHLY TUMULTUOUS TIME FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THEY FACE BUDGET% CUTS TECHNOLOGY WAS BEGINNING TO CHANGE EDUCATIONAL DELIVERY. AND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WERE AND QUITE FRANKLY STILL ARE TODAY QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT A COLLEGE DEGREE. IS WORTH THE COST. THESE CHALLENGES HAVE NOT GONE AWAY IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND THEY'VE ONLY INTESA INTENSIFIED WITH NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT. LABOR MARKET SHIPS AND SOARING COSTS OF LIVING. DECADES AGO THE STATE MADE A PROMISE THAT CITIZENS TO CITIZENS AT A PUBLIC EDUCATION WOULD BE WAITING FOR EVERY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. EVERY SINGLE ONE. AND IN THE YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED THIS PACT HAVE STARTED TO STE PROCTER. NOW MORE THAN ANY TIME IN SINCE THE MASTER PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED THE STATE NEEDS EXPERT LEADERSHIP TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF SHEPHERDING ITS HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM BACK. TOWARDS THE MID ORIGINAL MANDATE OF PROVIDING EQUITABLE COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS TO ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. STRONG POLICY MAKING CRITICAL OVERSIGHT FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS. UMP REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT MECHANISM TO GUIDE THE PUBLIC AGENDA. THERE ARE FOUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES THAT WE SEE AS BEING CRITICAL FOR THIS. SECULAR AGENCY ONE IS PROJECTING THE STATE'S HIGHER EDUCATION NEEDS SECONDLY IS TO AND IDENTIFY GAPS BETWEEN WHAT PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED. AND WHAT WOULD BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS INCLUDING THE ADULT STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THIRD IS TO DEVELOP COST EFFECTIVE PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES WHILE BALANCING THE IMPERATIVES OF ACCESS AND QUALITY PER OP FOR STUDENTS. AND THEN FOURTH TO ENHANCE PLANNING AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND COORDINATION FOR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SEGMENTS AND WITH POLICY MAKERS. UP CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW BECAME AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE INGENUITY OF STATE LEADERS WHO RECOGNIZE THAT INVESTMENT IN OUR RESIDENTS WOULD RETURN ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO THE STATE. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE HIGH STANDARDS A STUDENT SUCCESS ACCOUNTABILITY AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES WE MUST HAVE COORDINATION AND HAVE THAT BE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION.
