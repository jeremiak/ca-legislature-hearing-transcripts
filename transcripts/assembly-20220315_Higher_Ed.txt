THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- GOOD TO BE HERE AT THE FIRST HEARING OF THE YEAR CORRECT CORRECT IN THE FIRST BILL THE YEAR. AND THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WE HAD A BIG DEBATE YESTERDAY. IN THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT UC BERKELEY. AND ENROLLMENT AND SYKORA ALL THOSE OTHER STUFF HAPPENING BUT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE THERE. WAS IS ON DEATH HOUSING FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AT OUR AMPUSES. THIS DEALS WITH THE STUDENTS TODAY THAT ARE FACING HOUSING INSECURITY AND SOME FRANKLY ARE HOMELESS. AT THIS DEALS WITH OUR QUEST THAT WE'RE WORKING ON TO BUILD MORE- TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT OUR UC SYSTEM OR CSU SYSTEM WE NEED MORE HOUSING ON CAMPUS SO. I'M PRESENTING YOU TODAY AB SIXTY NO TO AUTHORED BY YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER TANG AND MYSELF. TO BRING UP AND SIT MEMBER CERVANTES TO BRING ABOUT MORE STUDENT HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA THIS WOULD CREATE A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIA STUDENT HOUSING FUND. TO PROVIDE ZERO INTEREST LOANS FOR UC CSU INCOMMUNICADO LEDGES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING FOCUSES STUDENTS WE ARE FLEXIBILITY FOR OTHER STAFF AT THE SEGMENTS. AGAIN WE KNOW THAT HOUSING IS A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IT ACCOUNTS FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF THE TOTAL COST OF GOING TO COLLEGE HOUSING. AS A RESULT MORE MORE COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE HOUSING INSECURITY. WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO ATTEND. CLLR AND PERFORM. BUT PROVIDING FIVE BILLIONS INTEREST LOANS WE ESTIMATE THIS COULD BUILD AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BEDS IN CALIFORNIA TO DEAL WITH. OUR CURRENT- CRISIS AS WELL AS- FOCUSING ON ON FUTURE DEMAND. BECAUSE THIS IS A REVOLVING LOAN LOAN FUND IT WILL LEVERAGE ONE TIME FUNDING TO PROVIDE AN ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR STUDENT HOUSING ESSENTIALLY REPLENISHING ITSELF. OVER TIME- THESE LOAN REPAYMENTS WOULD BE RETURNED AND FOUND OTHER. OBJECTS IN FINANCE FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AT THIS WILL ALSO HELP DEAL WITH CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS LET'S FACE IT MANY AS COLLEGE CAMPUSES STUDENTS ARE LIVING IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAMPUS AND THEY'RE TAKING AWAY HOUSING THAT COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS DEALS WITH WITH TWO REALLY KEY ISSUES- I AM CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE YOUR THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE NOT ONLY PAYING PREVAILING WAGE BUT I ALSO HAVE- LEGITIMATE. AND PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTORS THAT TAKE CARE OF THEIR WORKERS PAY THEIR WORKERS LIVING WAGES AND ALSO MAKE SURE WE HAVE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO BUILD UP WORKERS. HAS NOT LOST UPON ME THAT THIS WILL FOCUS ON STUDENTS GOING TO COLLEGE WE ALSO SHOULD FOCUS ON THE STUDENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS AND LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DISTRACTED BALLOTS YEARS WORKING ON THAT AS THIS BILL. MOVES ALONG THAT WITH ME TODAY IS THE CHANCELLOR FROM UC SAN DIEGO CHANCELLOR KHOSLA AS WELL AS A STUDENT REPRESENTING THE STUDENT VOICE THANK YOU. I GET. I'M GONNA TAKE A SMALL BREAK HERE- TO HAVE THE AS SECRETARY. I'LL FOR THE- PRETENDS MEDINA HERE CHOI YEAH FONG BLOOM GABRIEL IRWIN KILEY LEVINE LOW. SANTIAGO VALLADARES WEBER. BEFORE QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED- WE LIKE TO CALL YOUR ON YOUR FIRST WITNESS YES THANK YOU MISTER BECAUSE LA. BUT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY GOOD MORNING GERMANY NOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF CALIFORNIA AND WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FIND OUR MUCH NEEDED HOUSING COURSE WHO. I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT INVOLVED TWENTY TWENTY UC SAN DIEGO OPEN THE FOR LIVING AND LEARNING COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA CALLED THENORTH KOREAN CLIENTS LIVING AND LEARNING NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE TWO THOUSAND BUT FACILITY FOR A FIX COLLEGE. WE ALSO HAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE THEATER DISTRICT LIVING LEARNING NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND BED. FACILITY AND WILL OPEN IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE UILT A LOT WE ARE ANXIOUS TO BUILD MORE BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER FOR YOU HOUSING GUARANTEED TO OUR UNDERGRADS. AT BELOW MARKET RATES. RECENTLY WE WILL RECORD BUT WE WERE PLEASANTLY. WHEN TWO WEEKS AGO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE FUND HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS UC SAN DIEGO SEVERAL CANYON LET'S HOUSING PROJECT. WITH THE NEW GRANT FUNDING FOR SOME HOUSING LET AT THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED LAST YEAR. EVER CANYON WESSEL HOUSE UPPER DIVISION AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. NEXT TO A NEW LIGHT PROBABLY STOP CAMPUS. AND IT WILL PROVE THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW US TO BUILD A THIRTY HUNDRED BAD. AND ALSO PROVIDE IT'LL HUNDRED OKAY. NEEDIEST TUNES AROUND DISCOUNT OF UP. 50% BELOW MARKET. THIS IS VERY. WELL THE UC SANTA CA REALLY GREAT DEPRESSION ABOUT THE LATEST WORK TO CREATE A FROM BUT SOMEHOW WE BELIEVE THAT A GROUP WALDRON WITH ZERO PER AND RATE WILL ALLOW THE CARE. THE BILL EVEN MORE HOW ON CAMP MACRON FOR RUNS FOR AND HELP PRESERVE THAT CAPACITY FOR OTHER CORE MISSION CAPITAL PROJECTS AS O- THE PUBLIC NOT REQUIRE SAID THIS WILL BE A REVOLVING LINE OF LOAN THAT WILL KEEP ON BUILDING HOUSING FOR A VERY LONG TIME TO COME. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE THAT LET THEM ATTEND THE IMPACT OF THE EVERY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT UC SAN DIEGO THIS WEEK AND SEE PERCENT AND BECAUSE AS PART OF THIS BOOK- IN LONG WOULD GENERATE AND IN ORDER SAVINGS OF TWO ONE. WHICH COULD BE DOES FOR THE LOOK AT THOUSANDS TO- OF ABOUT MEDIA ONES AND BEES WILL BECOME RESIDENTS AND THIS WOULD NOT REALLY CONSTRUCT THAT BUT IT WOULD ALLOW TO INVEST TO ONE DOLLARS. AND MAPPING TO THE STATE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR IN HOUSE EIGHT TO BECAUSE RESIDENTS TO ORDER THIRTY FOR YEAR PREPAYMENT PERIOD OF LONG SO FOR EVERY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THIRTY FIVE WILL END UP GETTING SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS A HOUSING EIGHT AND ONE THAT THE SECTOR INTO THE RIGHT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD THIRTY OF THE 8% BRENT BELOW THIRTY IF BELOW RATE FOR UNDERGRADUATES ON A VERY SIGNIFICANT BELOW MARK THE OKAY. THIS ALSO CREATE A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY CLICK ON. JOB OR THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND ABOUT THIRTY NINE. BECAUSE CODY AND BY THAT I PROGRAM JOBS. AND IF THE STATE ALLOW US TO MEDIC THE GROUP FIVE. THE FUNDS COULD BE THE LEAD. AS THE FEDERAL MCCARTY SAID. THE BILL AND IT'S NOT BAD FOR FUNDING. HOUSING A. XPANDER INVENTORY FROM ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND BEDS IN A NET INCREASE OF SIX THOUSAND BUT TO OFFER OFFER A FORTY HOUSING GUARANTEE WE NEED TO ADD ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND BEDS MORE OVER THE NEXT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS. THIS LOAN THAT YOU ABOUT TO CONSIDER VEHICLE OFF WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN THE UC SAN DIEGO'S ABILITY TO OFFER A FORTY HOUSING GUARANTEE. THEN I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE YOU IT WILL HELP OTHER CAMPUSES IN THE UC IN THE SAME WAY. THAT IT WOULD HELP UC SAN DIEGO. SO LET ME JUST FINISH BY SAYING THAT WE BELIEVE THAT A REVOLVING LOAN INTEREST RATES AT 0% WOULD EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN FROM HOUSING. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. UC CAMPUSES WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY AND BE ABLE TO BUILD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE HOUSING THAT ONE TIME FUNDING TO PROVIDE. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS ANYMORE STRONGLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE A SECOND WITNESS WAS MCCARTY. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. PERFECT I GET AFTERNOON CAMBODIA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GOING TO BE COMING SHOKER AND I AM A SOPHOMORE AT UC SAN DIEGO TODAY I AM SPEAKING TO YOU ON BEHALF OF GENERATION UP A STUDENT LED ADVOCACY GROUP FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND THE PRODUCT MONSTER OF EIGHTY SIX YOU KNOW TO. AS YOU ARE MOST LIKELY AWARE UCSB AND COLLEGES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCING A HOUSING CRISIS. MORE THAN A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE OR ARE EXPERIENCING HOUSING INSECURITY. AND IS ONE OF THOSE COLLEGE STUDENTS LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN FORTUNATE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LIVE AT THE BEAUTIFUL NORTH TORREY PINES LIVING AND LEARNING COMMUNITY. AT CHAMPASAK WILL MENTION I'M ACTUALLY SITTING IN MY DORM ROOM RIGHT NOW. BUT NEXT YEAR MY HOUSING GUARANTEE EXPIRES AND I WILL HAVE TO SHARE AN APARTMENT OFF CAMPUS BEFORE OTHERS JUST MAKE GRANT. AND FOR WORKING THREE JOBS AS A FULL TIME STUDENT. IT MEANS THE NINETY MINUTE DAILY COMMUTE FROM RIVERSIDE. IT MEANS BEING FORCED TO TAKE TIME OFF TRANSPORT OR EVEN DROP OUT OF UC SAN DIEGO BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT FIND A PLACE TO LIVE. THESE ARE NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS EVERY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENT HAVE A HOUSING STORY OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES. AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE ACADEMIC RIGOR OF CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES COVERED NINETEEN HAVE PLACED ADDITIONAL CHAPTERS ON CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENT. FINANCIAL STRAIN FAMILY CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. ON TOP OF THIS THE TOLL THAT HOUSING INSECURITY TAKES ON STUDENT BEING MENTAL HEALTH AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. IN ORDER TO LEARN AND THRIVE YOU NEED TO HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET INCLUDING ACCESS TO AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. IN CALIFORNIA WE AT THE STATE COMMITTED TO MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE THAN EVER BEFORE AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS THAT GOAL. AB SIXTEEN OH TWO WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LIVES OF STUDENTS BY ESTABLISHING A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FUND TO HELP CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BILLS MORE AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. SO ON BEHALF OF GENERATION UP AND THE STUDENT VOICES WE REPRESENTS I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE THOSE ON. EIGHTY SIXTEEN OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

RIGHT NOW WE'RE TAKING WE'RE TAKING SUPPORT RIGHT NOW SO IF YOU. COME BACK IN JUST A MINUTE. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THAT TIME OKAY. SO WE'LL GO TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WOULD LIKE TO COME UP TO THE TABLE. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE WELCOME TO SIT AT THE TABLE IF YOU'D LIKE. RIGHT THE WHOLE WORLD IT IS IT IS WE'RE GETTING BACK TO IT. AND ANY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND I TAKE A SECOND WITNESS FOR TWO MINUTES IF YOU HAVE ONE OKAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY PEOPLE OF MY NAME IS ERIN LEHANE AND I APPEAR BEFORE YOU ON BEHALF OF THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION HARD WORKING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THAT MAKE UP THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTEEN OH TWO AND LESS ADEQUATELY AMENDED WITH WORK FORCE PROTECTIONS. WE SUPPORT THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL WE SHOULD ALL BE WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLEGE BOUND KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING SO AT THE EXPENSE OF BLUE COLLAR KIDS. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY APPROACH THE AUTHOR TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT LABOR STANDARDS THAT WOULD NOT ONLY PROTECT WORKERS BUT ALSO CREATE. CORRESPONDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON COLLEGE BOUND KIDS BUT YET TO NO AVAIL. EVERY TIME A LEGISLATOR MAKES DECISION TO INCLUDE SKILLED AND TRAINED LABOR LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THEY'RE DOING TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. FIRST IT ENSURES THAT ALL WORKERS ON A JOB SITE ARE TREATED AND PAID FAIRLY AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND IT SHORT SHIFTING WAYS SHOULD NOT BE WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SECONDLY THAT A PERCENTAGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON SITE ARE FROM AN ACCREDITED APPRENTICE PROGRAM. THIS IN TURN CREATES ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR STATE OF THE ART APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHERE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND APPRENTICES TRAINING TO BE THE NEXT GENERATION. OF SKILLED TRADES PERSON. AN APPRENTICESHIP AT THE BUILDING TRADES IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PASS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR NON COLLEGE BOUND YOUNG PEOPLE. AFTER COMPLETING APPRENTICESHIP. A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM MUCH LIKE COLLEGE THAT INCLUDES BOTH CLASSROOM AND PAID ON THE JOB TRAINING. YOU'VE EARNED A PROFESSION THAT CAN PROVIDE FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR A LIFETIME. EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF OUR PREMISES ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ONE IN FIVE COMES FROM THE FOSTER CARE AND MANSON YOUTH OR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS CARRY WITH THEM HUGE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUE AND ARE QUITE LITERALLY LIFE CHANGING. SO ALTHOUGH WE SUPPORT BUILDING MORE STUDENT HOUSING AND AS SUCH ARE SPONSORS OF A SENATE BILL TO DO JUST THAT WE ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF DOING SO IN A WAY THAT HURTS WORKERS EMBOLDENS THE UDERGROUND ECONOMY AND SENDS THE MESSAGE TO BLUE COLLAR KIDS. THAT THERE ARE PERTINENT EASE ARE SOMEHOW LESS OF A PRIORITY TO CALIFORNIA THAN THEIR COLLEGE BOUND PIERCED. ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERSHIP AND ESPECIALLY OUR SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND APPRENTICES WE URGE A NO VOTE UNLESS THIS BILL IS AMENDED TO INCLUDE LABOR PROTECTIONS. SO AS TO AVOID A TRULY CLASSES CONSEQUENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND IF THERE'S A SECOND WITNESS WHO WOULD LIKE TWO MINUTES- MAY HAVE THAT AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME TO THE TABLE BECAUSE YOU I THINK WE'RE OKAY RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO THEN I'LL TAKE- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WHO ARE HERE IN PERSON AND THEN I'LL GO TO THE PHONES. SO YOUR NAME MAN- WE REPRESENT. MY NAME IS MARK MORTAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE MID VALLEY BUILDING TRADES- PAST BUSINESS MANAGER OF YOU A LOCAL TWO TWO EIGHT UP IN MARYSVILLE CALIFORNIA- I WANT TO SAY THAT- WE ARE- FOR THIS IF THEY WOULD MEAN THIS. AND PROTECT WORKERS PROTECT THE SKILLED AND TRAINED- THE STATE ACCREDITED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS I CAN TELL YOU ON THE LAST ONE THAT BUILT A THREE MILLION DOLLAR FACILITY NORTH OF SACRAMENTO. AND THEY'VE BUILT THOUSANDS OF HOUSES AND SHE GOES STATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE NEVER PUT AN APPRENTICE ON THE JOB. WE NEVER SENATE JOURNEYMEN OUT TO GO TO WORK. AND THEY WON'T DO IT IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO SO IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE AMEND THIS BILL. DO THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE STATE ACCREDITED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND IT'S A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY.

OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS WOULDN'T WHEN SKILLED LABOR TO READY BE REQUIRED IF IT'S STATE MONEY THAT IS BEING ISSUED A PREVAILING WAGE S REQUIRED SO THE PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGES THE COR CHOIR WENT WITH PUBLIC MONEY IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO USE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE TO SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE IS SEPARATE FROM THE- PREVAILING WAGE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. OF WORKERS ON SITE ARE GRADUATES OF STATE ACCREDITED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH THEN TURNS THE SYSTEM TO ALLOW US TO TAKE IT MORE APPRENTICES HAVE APPRENTICES ON THESE ACTUAL JOB SITES AND BRING MORE INTO THEIR- TRAINING CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT SO- CLARIFICATION SO I THIS IS HAVE YOU HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH LABOR THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY YES WE HAVE AND- I'M I'M FULL SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT HERE WHICH IS MAKE SURE WE HAVE. BUDGET CONTRACTORS AT PAY PREVAILING WAGE IN THE DON'T HAVE SHADY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH IS BEEN THREE PEOPLE NEVER HAVE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO MOVE UP IN THE BUILDING TRADES- A CAREER PATH THAT THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE RELATED TO NOT ONLY THIS PUBLIC PROJECTS BUT ALSO HOUSING AND SO I KNOW THERE'S CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES AND WITH LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES ON HOW TO CRAFT THAT. THAT TO FIND COMPROMISE SO I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS WORK WERE AYE AYE AYES TO WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS- THIS IS A BUDGET THING AS WELL AS YOU KNOW SO THE CAN CURRENTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET. PROCESS SO CORRECT YEAH WORK TO. A SOLUTION YEAH. FROM I THINK ARE WE WILL I THINK THERE WAS A GRAND THERE IS AN OPTION LAST YEAR ON IT BUT TO CONFUSE THINGS A SEPARATE BELT LIKE A DIFFERENT THRESHOLD TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS. AT LEAST ONE MORE THAN ONE BID ON A PROJECT AND MAKE SURE AS A CERTAIN THRESHOLD SO THAT COULD BE IN THE MIX OR COULD BE OTHER OPTIONS I KNOW THAT THAT. BUILDING TRADES LEADERSHIP ALONG WITH OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY THEY'RE- TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS THANK. THANK YOU AS WELL AS THERE IS AND THEN I'LL GO TO MISTER SONNTAG WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE AUTHOR- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT ONE OF THINGS I HEAR MOST FROM EMPLOYERS IN MY DISTRICT AND- WHICH ARE UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- IS THAT IS REALLY HARD TO RECRUIT A WORKFORCE WHEN THEY CAN'T FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY WORK AND I THINK THAT THIS DOES A GREAT JOB OF TRYING TO ADDRESS TRAVEL FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY ON WHICH IS. DEEPLY NEEDED I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE ATTACHED TO THIS WOULD THIS BE AN INITIAL WOULD THERE BE A BREAKDOWN OF INITIAL FUNDING THROUGH CERTAIN BUDGET YEARS WE JUST THIS BUT- FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS HOW HOW IS GONNA ACTUALLY WORK IN THE FINANCIAL POINT- WELL THIS BUILDS UPON. WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR. AT AND THE REALITIES WE GOT. AN AMAZING AMOUNT NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND TO FUND THESE PROJECTS THROUGH. SO THAT SHOWS THAT THE DEMAND IS THERE. FOR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND HELP WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS SO. WE'RE COMING BACK THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW DOUBLING UP FOR EVEN MORE. WITH FIVE BILLION ONE TIME INFUSION OF- FIVE BILLIONDOLLARS OF ONE TIME. INVESTMENT AS YOU KNOW FROM THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS WITH RON- THERE IS ONE TIME MONEY AND TO HAVE A- SURGE IN ONE TIME TAX REVENUE IN THIS YEAR'S- PROJECTED BUDGET. SO THE IDEA THERE IS TO USE SOME OF THOSE ONE TIME MONIES. FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS WHICH WE KNOW IS IT IS VERY TIMELY WITH THE- CONVERSATIONAL WE NEED TO DO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET RELATED. AGAIN MEASURES AND SO FORTH THIS IS A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY. TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE- UP. IT IN CALIFORNIA. HOUSING CALL PORTABILITY. I'M QUESTION I DO HAVE IS. JUST AND AGAIN WHAT WOULD. WOULD IT. WHEN WOULD IT WOULD BE A THIRTY YEAR LOAN WITH THOSE PAYMENTS START YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PAY BACK WOULD BE ON THIS IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS RECURRING REVOLVING ACCOUNT TO LAST FOR YOU KNOW. HOWEVER MANY YEARS DECADES TO BE GREAT TO IT EMBRITTLEMENT IMP YEAH EXACTLY I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE PAYMENT WOULD BE BACK AND THEN LASTLY I AM I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A SEAT YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE USING SKILLED AND TRAINED AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU WILL STILL BE WORKING- WITH THE BUILDING TRAINS ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT. AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP YOU KNOW. WHAT I'M ALSO FEARFUL OF IS THAT IF WE DON'T REALLY ADDRESS OUR SEEK WHAT ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING WHEN IT COMES TO PROJECTS LIKE THIS. AND EITHER HAVE A STREAMLINED APPROACH. BUILT IN AND OR AN EXEMPTION FOR THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED BY THE STATE- THAT. THEY COULD TAKE LONGER AND BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY- SO. I WOULD JUST KIND OF LOVE YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT WE ANSWERED MR WHEN THAT SKILLED AND TRAINED. WE'RE COMMITTED TO I'M COMMITTED TO HAVING THAT TYPE OF PROVISION IN THIS POLICY IN THIS BILL OR IN THE BUDGET WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY FIND THIS EITHER WAY- THE FIRST THING ON THE ON THE PAY BACK IT IS TO JUST BE AS THE CHANCELLOR FROM. UC SAN DIEGO COASTAL SAID. ESSENTIALLY AS OPPOSED TO BORROWING MONEY FROM WELLS FARGO THEY BY AND YOU KNOW PAY THAT. PHARMACY TO CALIFORNIA'S THE TO BE LOWER AFTER THIS PAYMENTS THEY BEACON OF WITHOUT THE INTERESTED BE LOWER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN THE BILL TO USE THAT SAVINGS TO PASS ON TO HAVE. A CHEAPER HOUSING FOR THEIR STUDENTS- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THEY WOULD PAY BACK THE LOAN JUST AS A TRADITIONAL NON THEY WOULD IN THE COMMERCIAL- WORLD. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE ON REGULATIONS WHEN THAT LOAN PAYMENT WOULD BE DO- PROBABLY SIMILAR TO CONSTRUCTION LOAN IT'S NOT. RIGHT AT DAY ONE YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO YOUR PROJECT FINISHES BEFORE YOU CAN START COLLECTING. RENT FROM THAT PROJECT SO- BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE AND THEN LASTLY ON THAT ON THE SYKORA- I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW OTHER POLICY BILLS I DO NOTE THAT IN THE UNIVERSITY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN- PROCESS. TO APPROVE PROJECTS INSTEAD IS THE CSU SO THEY GO THROUGH THE- ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS. THROUGH THAT. SO- I CAN'T HAPPEN IT'S FOR YOU THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- GO TO MR SANTIAGO. THANK YOU MR NOT A HUGGABLE THE TIME FINANCE COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN LET OTHER MEMBERS IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT YEAH AND SO- I APPRECIATE THE HOUSING- EFFORT BECAUSE I THINK WITH MUCH NEEDED UNITED TALKED ABOUT THIS OVER AN OVERSIGHT BY APPLAUD THE EFFORTS AND THANK YOU. I MEAN IT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED USE PUBLIC FUNDS- IN A WAY DID NOT AND INCLUDE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND I KIND OF DIFFERENTIATE AND WHEN I LOOKED AT A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. VERSUS SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. NOW I WAS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD ALL FOLKS HERE HEARD ME SAY THAT OVERALL RATING. BUT BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WITHOUT A COMPLIANCE PIECE TO IT. LEADS TO THE SAME ACTIONS THAT WERE TRYING TO PREVENT SO OFTEN TIMES AT LEAST WHEN I GOT ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD. AND THEY HAD A FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. WITHOUT A ROBUST FULLY FUNDED- COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IT REALLY DID MEAN ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY. WE IMPLEMENT WE WENT TOWARDS A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BECAUSE- A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. REALLY DOES HAVE ALL THE COMPLIANCE PIECES IN THE FRAMEWORK. TO DO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. GIVE EXAMPLES BECAUSE WE HAD. WITH GOOD CONTRACTORS OF THE DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE HAD SOME BAD ACTORS. WE'RE ON PAPER IT SHOWED THAT THEY PAID THE FORTY HOURS WHEN THE AFFIDAVIT- OR WHEN YOU TALK TO THE EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE OF ONLY PAY TWENTY DOLLARS. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL WE PROTECT. WORKFORCE IN PLACE BUT- WITH WITH THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE YOU HAVE A BONAFIDE. PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY DOES ENSURE THAT THE EMPLOYEE GETS PAID WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PAID. BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS. ADVOCACY AND REPRESENTATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE. A SIDE OF ALL THAT THE PROJECTS ARE MUCH BETTER. WE WENT FROM A PROGRAM THAT WAS DOING OVER RUNS GETTING- SETTLED THROUGH COURT PROCESSES. TO A PROGRAM THAT WAS. THAT WAS ON TIME AND THE PROJECT WILL WORK IN THE WAY THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SO THERE IS A- BENEFIT TO THE- TO THE PROGRAM NOT JUST A DRIVE TO SEE HOW CHEAP YOU CAN GET THE PROGRAM WHEN YOU BID. ON ON THOSE ON THE LOWEST BID. SO THIS IS A BENEFIT TO THAT THAT'S WHAT. I THINK IT'S WORTH THE CONVERSATION OF HAVING. A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IN FINDS MY MOM YOU THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC ABOUT. WHEN I ALSO WORKED AT THE BORDER LEGAL WE DID DO ON PROJECTS THAT WERE SAID TO HAVE HAD SKILLED AND FOR A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. MULTI TASK. SWEEP THE RATE WHATEVER ONE CAUGHT WHERE YOU. CLEARLY ON PAPER LOOK LIKE IT BUT IT WASN'T. A. N. N. IN THESE WERE ACTIONS DONE WITH CAL OSHA DEPARTMENT OF IT ALSO RELATIONS I MEAN GO ON THE BILL ALPHABET LISTED ET D. B. O. WE- EN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. SO THERE IS A BENEFIT TO DOING THAT WITH A PUBLIC FUNDS. WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH THE ISN'T THE HOUSING ISN'T THE CONCEPT ISN'T ISN'T THAT DOING THIS IT'S THAT WE DON'T INSURE THAT THESE DOLLARS. ARE IN THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO LIKE IT'S- LIKE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE SAID AN APPEAL A WHICH REALLY ARE. KIND OF SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE ENSURES THAT WE DO THAT THAT WE WILL GET THAT SET OUTCOME. AND YOU KNOW. AND I'M WONDERING WHAT. KIND OF CONVERSATIONS YOU'VE HAD ABOUT FIVE BECAUSE I STRUGGLE WITH THAT PIECE AND I KNOW. I KNOW YOU'VE YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT YOU THAT YOU WERE WORK WORKING ON IT BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR- HUH LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. YOUR THOUGHTS ON SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE IN. THE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY. YEAH YEAH AS I SAID EARLIER THIS THIS WAS- TIMING I PROPOSED LAST YEAR. IT IT GOT TAKEN OVER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO PUT SKILLED AND TRAINED IN THIS BILL. THAT LEADERSHIP IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DECLINED TO PUT SKILLED AND TRAINED IN THAT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INCLUSION LAST YEAR. I THOUGHT I SUPPORT IT I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY HOW WE CAN HAVE IT IN THIS BILL IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS IT'S AN pONGOING THING MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT- THE BUILDING TRADES. STATE BUILDING TRIP STRAYED'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR SOME BELIEVERS HAVE ARE WORKING ON THIS AND- I'M HOPEFUL CAN BE INCLUDED. IN THIS AND OUR BUDGET ACTION IN THE COMING MONTHS. YES YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE QUESTIONS ARE COMPLICATED RIGHT MR LEVINE AND THEN DOCTOR WEB. YEAH WELL THE FIRST WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SOME NUMBER I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL YOU'RE HITTING ON A VERY OBVIOUS IS A SUCH A- IMPORTANT TOPIC RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO EXPAND. ENROLLMENT IN ALL OF HER UNIVERSITIES AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN AND THAT DEMANDS LIKE A HOUSING SOLUTION WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CSU YOU NAME IT- IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING IT IT BRINGS ME BACK. TO TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH I KNOW WAS A LIFETIME AGO I DON'T THINK ANYONE BESIDES THE CHAIR AND I WERE MEMBERS AT THE TIME- ON A BILL THAT IF HI. CLEAR THE COBWEBS OUT WAS SB SEVEN- THE DATA STEINBERG AND- AND CANNELLA HAD AUTHORED TOGETHER AND IT WAS ABOUT PREVAILING WAGE WHEN PUBLIC MONIES WAS INVOLVED THIS IS THAT ANYONE IN THE GALLERIES. YEAH THEY'VE GOT SOME HEAD HEADS NODDING BACK THERE I KNOW IT'S JUST LIKE GOT GOT A HIBERNATION BE LIKE I REMEMBER THAT SO- REALLY CHALLENGING DIFFICULT ON BILL AND ERE WE ARE- EIGHT YEARS LATER AND- IT'S AS THOUGH- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE OTHER. YOU KNOW FINER PIECES OF THAT- PARTICULARLY IN THIS SPACE. AND AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT CONVERSATION AND SO NOT TO BELABOR IT- WHAT IS SO FASCINATING TO ME AND WHY YOU'RE- SO APPROPRIATE TO AUTHOR THIS BILL AS IT GOES TO THE POLICY COMMITTEES. IS BECAUSE OF YOUR ROLE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- SO. YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY THINK OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AS THE- BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE OR HOUSING COMMITTEE THAT DIDN'T IS THIS DOUBLE REFERRED TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO THAT'S THAT'S FASCINATING IN ITS IN ITS OWN WAY- AND THEN- AND SO YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FINANCING. FINER DETAILS- WHICH- IT ISN'T REALLY ARE COMMITTEE EITHER WE JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. TO KEEP THE COST DOWN BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT FEES TUITION ALL OF THAT THAT'S ALMOST A CONTROLLED COST GIVEN THE BUDGET THE WAY IT'S PLAYED OUT OVER THE PAST DECADE BUT WHAT'S NOT UNDER CONTROL. IS OUR COST OF LIVING- WHICH IS JUST SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF HAND- AND SO- SO IT'S REALLY ON I THINK THE PRESSURE IS BACK ON THIS BUDGETARY PROCESS. LIKE HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS IMPORTANT LABOR ISSUE THIS COMMITTED THESE BILLS ARE GOING TO LABOR COMMITTEE OR HOUSING COMMITTEE OR ANY OF THESE OTHER COMMITTEES. AND WE DON'T REALLY LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT GETS THE PROPER HERE HEARING. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND DOT. SO I JUST WANTED TO REFLECT ON HOW MUCH OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY JUST REALLY BECAUSE BACK TO YOU AS THE AUTHOR AND THAT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THAT ON AND I REALLY RESPECT. YOU IN IN A IN THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE REALLY TAKEN THAT ON SO THANK YOU. YEAH SURE ANSWER. YEAH I WILL KNOW THAT THIS IS- THIS IS ONE OF THE I THINK THE FIRST BILL INTRODUCED WE CAME BACK INTO SESSION I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH. HOUSING CRISIS AND THE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS YOU'RE RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF. FOCUSING ON HOUSING WE WE'VE NEVER BEEN CALIFORNIA. AT THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE CALL JUST TAKE CARE ON THEIR OWN THEY BORROW MONEY FROM THE BANKS AND THEY BUILD THEIR HOUSING AND AS WE SEE IT'S WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR'S AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO PUT OUR OWN MONEY ON THE TABLE AND HELP. BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING. AND WE SAW SO MANY PEOPLE APPLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS. BOB CHARTS IS LIKE AND WE'RE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM COLLEGES AND ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS. AND I WANT TO PICK MORE WINNERS. AND WE WANT TO PICK WINNERS AND FAMILIES ARE GOING TO COLLEGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WITH THE WORKERS. ARE TAKING CARE WHEN THEY BUILT IT SO THAT'S THE THING THAT WE'RE DOING HERE- I WILL KNOW THAT THIS IS JOINING AUTHORED BY. MYSELF CERVANTES MR. MEDINA MR TANKS THE TANK AND I ARE THE BUDGET LEADS ON THIS ISSUE WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. THE LAST FEW DAYS WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH. OUR SPEAKER ABOUT THIS THIS IS A PRIORITY WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT. UNDERLYING LABOR ISSUE. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE. WE GET IT RIGHT AND IT'S A WIN WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK MR LEVINE FOR TAKING HIS BACK. DIGITAL SERIOUSLY MEMORY LANE YEAH. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. YES BEFORE BEFORE I GO TO DOCTOR WEBER AYE I JUST HAVE A TEXTURE FROM MY OWN STATE BUILDING TRADE REPRESENTATIVE- BUILD PEDAS AND- HE TEXTING ME THAT THAT HE DID GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK ON THE PHONE LINE SO I JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE BILL BELLAS AND THE STATE BUILDING TRADES- IN RIVERSIDETHAT THEY ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. DR WEBER. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TACKLING THIS- COMPLICATED BUT VERY CRITICAL ISSUE- YOU KNOW AS AND WHEN HE STATED HOUSING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS BUT I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU INCLUDED FACULTY BECAUSE THEY NEED A PLACE TO STAY AS WELL- YOU KNOW. JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID- IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO INCLUDE- THE USE OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. SO AS YOU GO BACK AND YOU TALK WITH LEADERSHIP- PLEASE MAKE SURE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IT AND YOU'VE HAD. A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CALL AND- TAX- AND SO IF WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL- I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT TODAY SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO PASS IN THE CONVERSATIONS CAN. CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND WE CAN FIX WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS- AND SOME MY HOPE IS THAT ONCE IT HIT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE FLOOR. THAT THIS ISSUE WILL BE RESOLVED. BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER DR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND- OR SO. ALTHOUGH OF THE BILL WHICH IS A VERY AMBITIOUS AND A VERY IMPORTANT. I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND THEN ALSO WITH THE- TOLLAN IDEA EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS UC SYSTEM AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. IN A BUILDING HOUSING. OTHER THAN- EDUCATION. HOW TO APPROACH THE HOUSING ISSUES- THAT'S IMPORTANT TO. SO- WHETHER WE SHOULD DO THAT THE THAT IS A MILE OF ARCHING YOU KNOW THE FEELING AT THIS TIME. MORE SPECIFICALLY IF YOU CAN CLARIFY. OVER THIRTY YEARS SO WITH A NO INTEREST- SO EACH CAMPER SO WHEN THEY BORROWED THE FUND- THEY HAVE TO PRESENT THAT TO THE STATE THE HOW THEY WENT OUT PAY BACK. THE LOAN AMOUNT OF FOR THE- BUILDING PROJECT. THAT THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION OKAY YEAH AND US SECONDLY DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR THE CAMPUS ALMOST THE- BUILD THE BUILDING FOR THE HOUSING FOR THE FACULTY BECAUSE I SEE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FOR STUDENTS FACULTY AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS- SO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES I'M SURE THAT'D BE ARE SEGREGATED- SEGREGATED ASAP SEPARATE- SO- I'M SURE FOR THE STUDENTS TO OR BE- JUST LACKED APARTMENTS UP FOR. MONTH TO MONTH- INTERNAL OR YOU TO LEASE THE FOR THE ARE- FACULTY AND UP ON ON THE STAFF MEMBERS SHOW A WILL THIS BE THEIR OWN PURCHASE SO WHAT WOULD THIS BE OUT FOR AGAIN A LEASING PROGRAM- SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FUN THOUGH WHAT IS. ROLLER ROLLER ABOUT THE AND OUT FOR IS. SO YOU GO INTO THAT THE LEVEL YES. WHY CAN'T AND NINE QUESTIONS NOT TO SO LET ME TRY TO REMEMBER THEM. THE FIRST THING IS WE'RE NOT TELLING CAMPUS IS TO BUILD HOUSING THEY'RE BUILDING HOUSING ANYWAY. ALL YOU CAN SEE THIS YEAR IN FRONT OF ALL AGES THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY HIGH INTEREST RATES EVEN THIS LOW INTEREST RATE ERA. AND THE COMPETE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIKE A DEBT CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE BUILDING. BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES ON THE CAMPUS SO THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH DEBT CAPACITY THANK THEY CAN HOUSE ABOUT US HAVING THESE LOANS OVER HERE IT ALLOWS THEM. TO BUILD BUT THERE THESE PROJECTS ARE SHOVEL READY ANYWAY THERE'S MASSIVE DEMAND USUALLY IT'S RISKY TO BUILD A STUDENT HOUSING THEIR STUDENTS THERE ARE PLAYING. I NEED A PLACE TO STAY SO IT'S THAT'S NOT A SUPER RISKY PROPOSITION TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AT THESE CAMPUSES SO. THIS JUST ALLOWS THEM TO BORROW MONEY AT AT THE AT A LOWER RATE AND NOT HAVE TO BE STRETCHED WITH THE RATHER CAMPUS NEEDS WITH THAT CAPACITY. IT'LL BE A THIRTY YEAR. TERM JUST LIKE YOU JUST LIKE THEY WOULD DO TODAY WITH THE BANK THEY WOULD PAY A PRINCIPAL PAYMENT EACH MONTH. THEY WOULDN'T PAY THE INTERESTED OVERALL THEIR PAYMENTS WILL BE LOWER AS THEY BE BUT A SPREAD THAT. TO HAVE MORE HOUSING AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON THE- THE- WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS IT'S WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CAMPUSES SO FAR I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ANY HOMEOWNERSHIP THEY'RE ALL. A RENTAL PROJECTS THE OVERWHELMINGLY VAST MAJORITY WOULD BE- STUDENTS AS AS DR WEBER SAID THERE THAT WE MAY MAKE ALLOW ABILITY IN THERE FOR FACULTY AND STAFF YOU KNOW A LOT OF STAFF FOR LOW WAGE. STAFF THINK OF YOU KNOW THE THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE TYPE WORKERS AT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THE NOT. A PAID- YOU KNOW. HECK OF A LOT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD HOUSING IN SOME OF THESE HIGH COSTS COLLEGE TOWNS SO IT WILL BE ABLE TO BE- UTILIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY TYPE IN ENVIRONMENT. TO HELP ABOUT ANSWERS SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SO OR THE CAMPUS HOUSING SHALL BE IT MENTAL UNITS ARE NOT FOR PURCHASE. CORRECT I SEND YOU YOU ALSO OUT THIS FAR AS A REGULATIONS WE DO HAVE QUITE A FEW OF THEM IN HERE WORKING WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL WE JUST DID THIS A FEW MONTHS AGO WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW WITH GENERAL FUND MONEY FROM THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND SO WE SPECIFY THAT THEY HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW FINANCIALLY UNVIABLE PROJECTS WE DON'T WANT PIE IN THE SKY PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA FALL APART- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE PROJECTS. A PENCIL OUT AND THEY COULD YOU KNOW SERVED THE PURPOSE IN TERMS TO. AND ALSO BE TO PAY THE SERVICE THEM SO IT IS A SIMPLE RETURN SO WE CAN PHRASE IT AS A FI YOU ARE PROVIDING. JUST A NO INTEREST- THE BUILDING FUND THEM MAY DEVELOP WORD NO EXTRA. INTEREST IT'S JUST LIKE IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL. LENDERS SO ENCOURAGING CAMPUS IS- TO- EITHER BY WHAT BEARDED TO SOAK UP PURCHASES ARE INCLUDED WITH THESE FUNDS OF. RATHER THAN BUILDING FROM THE SCRATCH- I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT PRESCRIPTIVE AG I GUESS THE UNIVERSITY COULD GO AND PURCHASE AN APARTMENT BUILDING IF THAT ONE WAS THAT IT WAS THERE BUT- I THINK MOST THE PROJECT'S. DEBUT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK BY HAVING SHARED UNITS WITH YOU NOW- AND LOWER THE COSTS SO. I THINK MOST NAY WOULD BUILD THEMSELVES YEAH I HAVE A TENSE UP BUT OF COURSE INSTANCES TO JUST OUT OUT TO ADD ONE MORE QUESTION. THAT THE AS YOUR HEARD DOES SO MANY OPPOSITION STUFF FROM- BUILDING INDUSTRY- AND- I THOUGHT THE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ANY PUBLIC HOUSING- EGG- DEMANDS OF REQUIRES- TO HIRE- DO UNION WORKERS- AND THE TO PAID THE PREVAILING WAGE ANYWAY. AND THE WHY IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE IS- YOU'LL YOU'LL- BUILDING PROJECT BUT THE CAMPUS IS- AND THE EXISTING AT ALL. YEAH I THINK WE TRY TO ANSWER THAT TOO WITH SOME MEMBER- ONCE QUESTION SO THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY WE REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE BUT AS THAT WITNESS FROM THE STATE CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES ALLUDED THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A REQUIREMENT THEY HAVE SKILLED AND TRAINED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE. APPROPRIATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO THAT'S SOMETHING I SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND WE- OUR HOPE TO HAVE THAT INCLUDED IN THIS MEASURE IS THERE ANY PROBLEM FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THEY ARE AMENDMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WELL THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN FRONT OF US TODAY'S NOT IN PRINT OR ANYTHING BUT- YOU KNOW IF THIS PASSES WILL GO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. AND YOU KNOW WE'LL BE WORKING WITH WITH THE WITH THAT. BODY ON THAT NEXT TOPIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DIET MR SANTIAGO YEAH I KNOW MY AFFECTING THE AUTHOR FOR SITTING HERE AND- DIALOGUING WITH THIS BECAUSE THAT'S MEANINGFUL YOU KNOW- OFTENTIMES WE GET. THE AUTHORS IN THEIR BETTER AUTHORS AND OTHERS IN IN HE'S BEEN WILLING TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS AND GO BACK AND FORTH AND ENCOURAGED THE PUBLIC DEBATE AND I THINK THAT. THAT'S ADMIRABLE I WANNA THANK YOU. FOR DOING THAT. BUT BUT JUST TO TOUCH BASE A LITTLE BT LIKE IF I REMEMBER A LITTLE BIT AND HOPEFULLY REMEMBER WHAT ACTOR ABOUT WHAT CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST YEAR. WAS ABOUT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FOR THAT WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES THAT THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR IS ABOUT. IS ABOUT LARGER DEVELOPMENT WITH PUBLIC FUNDS AND SO THAT THAT DOES CHANGE THE CONVERSATION. IN TERMS OF NEEDING- TO PUSH FOR AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT DOES UPLIFT. FAMILIES PARTICULARLY IN THIS SPACE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC FUNDS. IN THE ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE- A. WAGE WHERE THEY CAN. PURCHASE A HOME AS OPPOSED TO A WAGE WAR IT'S CLOSE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN. THEIR STILL RENTING IN THEIR SITUATIONS NEVER APPROVED A PART OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING SHOULD BE HOW TO. UPLIFT OUR COMMUNITIES IN AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND- YOU KNOW THAT YOU SAID IT A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY. THAT YOU SUPPORT A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE CONVERSATION. ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT YOUR COMMITMENT TO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BY SUPPORTING. OTHER STUDENTS IN IN AND ITS DIRECT LINK- TO ADDING- AND SUPPORTING SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE I DON'T OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES MENTIONED SB SEVEN BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT THAT ALLOWS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TO BUILD HOUSING. WITH SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TO WORK BECAUSE IT DOES UP LIFT UP COMMUNITIES IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND ONE OF THE CAN KIND OF GET YOUR FEEDBACK ON ON YOUR SUPPORT FOR SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE AND AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS CRITICAL. TO WILL REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE NOW I REALIZE THAT THE FIRST COMMITTEE- THE LAST COMMITTEE AND WE WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT RESULT THAT. TO THE WAY ON I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. THE FIRST COMMITTEE YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. AND JUST KIND OF WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IN. IN THE NEED TO ADD A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE YEAH I KNOW I. LOOK WHERE WE'RE IN OUR BRAND NEW BUILDING ACROSS pWAS BUILT WITH PREVAILING WAGE. AND APPEAL LAY WHICH HAD SKILLED AND TRAINED. WHICH MADE THEY HAD GREAT PROGRAMS GOING TO WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO MAKE SURE WE- BRING PEOPLE TO AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A CAREER PATH- THEY HAD APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. SPENDING THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THEY COULD CHECK A BOX. LIKE SOME CONTRACTORS TO SO LIKE I PRICE WE'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND WE'VE SEEN THE PROJECTS ALL AROUND HERE IN OUR DOWNTOWN. UTILIZES I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS HERE. ON THIS ONE I KNOW THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE PROJECTS AND PUBLIC THIS IS A PUBLIC THING. SO I KNOW THERE'S- CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT LIKE I SAID OF TO SAY IT AGAIN WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES LEADERSHIP AND WITH OUR LEADERSHIP ON ALL THESE. SKILLED AND TRAINED. IDEAS FOR A BUNCH OF BILLS NOT JUST THIS ONE ON. AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS THAT ARE YOU KNOW PRIVATE DEVELOPERS IN THIS AND THAT I THINK THIS ONE'S A LITTLE MORE SIMPLISTIC AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S- PUBLIC DOLLARS I THINK. THAT ELEVATES. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- SPENDING OUR MONEY WISELY AND NOT YOU KNOW USING YOUR MONEY TO PAY. POVERTY WAGES AND AS YOU NOTED- HAVE CONTRACTORS THAT YOU KNOW. THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE SPIRITUAL LAW. SO I'M I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO. HAVE THOSE TYPES OF SKILLED AND TRAINED. PIECES THAT WE SAW THAT OUR NEW BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. IN THIS- FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REVOLVING FUND FOR STUDENT HOUSING. GOOD MR SANTIAGO. I MEAN I'M HEARING THAT IT'S GONNA GO AND FILL. IT BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK I'M- I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS THAT I'M I'D BE WILLING TO ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. RIGHT MR LOW IMAGES GET CLARIFICATION OF THAT AND- ON THAT- FROM THE GYM THE AUTHOR. AND CLEAR LINES OF COMMUNICATION SO I GET EXCITED HERE. SOMETHING ALREADY WE'RE GOING TO EASE BACK INTO THE COMMITTEE PROCESS I KNOW YES THE SOCIALIZATION BUT UP I DO IN THE FALL BUT I CALLED MR SANTIAGO NEXXAR RELIEVING THE POINT BUT- YOU CAN SEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS SOME MCCARTY AND- OF THAT MEANT THAT I DON'T FEEL ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS AT AS- AS OF IT WAS. INITIALLY PRESENTED BUT AFTER HEARING THE COMMITMENT AN EXPLANATION AS TO THE FRAME OF MIND THE CONTEXT TO A WIDER CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN BROADER CONVERSATIONS IS THAT ALSO YOUR OBSERVATION AND THEIR COMMITMENT AS WELL. WHEN YOUR- A 100% OKAY THANK YOU. MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- THINKING TERMS MCCARTY AND- FOR. EARLIER SO BENEFITS FROM THIS- ISSUE AND JUST CHECK MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS JUST BELOW A SUPPORT THE SKILLED IN THE- TRADEMARK FORCE PEACE AND- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. BRING US FORWARD I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR TO MAKE COLLEGES- SANTIAGO REFERENCED ADAMS MEDINA A WELL. BUT ONE OUT OF FIVE STUDENTS AT THE ALCHEMY COLLEGES REQUIRE SERVED ON FOR SEVEN YEARS- IDENTIFIED AS HOUSING SECURE AND SO OVER ABLE TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND TO ALSO LOOK AT. WORKFORCE HOUSING FOR STAFF AND FACULTY I THINK THIS CAN. ULTIMATELY BE A WIN WIN AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT THE SKELETAL- TRANSLATOR OF WORK FOR SPACES CRITICAL. AND OF THE COLLEGES ARE WE ALSO SPONSORED A WE ALSO HAVE. A STRONG PILLAR THERE BUT WE WERE THERE SO. I THINK GOING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EFFORTS ARE ON TO STERLING- BRING THIS FORWARD AND- OF REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SKILLED TRAINED. WORKFORCE PIECE AND ARE GONE FORTH THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT NOT SEEN ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF HISTORY. THE FIRST OF HIS BUT THAT IS AND THE SECOND SECOND. TAKEN BY DR CHOI OF THIS MCCARTY WITH YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I THINK I'M TIRED. I'M NOT SET HERE ASK HERE I HAVEA- THANK YOU- I WANNA ECHO- MR SANTIAGO AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING TIME AND DETAIL IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. OF HE COMMITTEE AND I WOULD JUST KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE- OF THE COMMITTEE HAD QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND TO MR LEVIN'S POINT I DON'T REMEMBER ALSO- TALKING ABOUT HOUSING IN THIS COMMITTEE. PREVIOUSLY BUT AS AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDI WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY ALL HAVE VERY CLEAR IN OUR MINDS AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING TO HIGHER EDUCATION- YOU KNOW NOT ONLY FOR A PLACE TO LIVE FOR STUDENTS AND THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING BUT ALSO THE DIFFERENCE THAT HOUSING MAKES. IN THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE COLLEGE AND SO THAT MOST UNIVERSITIES YOU KNOW EITHER RECOMMEND VERY STRONGLY OR OR REQUIRE RIGHT- THAT STUDENTS LIVE ON CAMPUS BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A IN RAGING EXPERIENCE IN THEIR EDUCATION SO TO THAT END I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY TALKING ABOUT HOUSING. SO AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS SUPPORT MEASURE AND ADDRESSING THE ONGOING CRISIS OF STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF AND UNDERSTAND AND AS YOU. AS YOU ALL EXPRESS THE CONCERNS REGARDING THE- P.

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS- UP BY I ALWAYS ENJOY SPEAKING ON- CHARLES DREW AND ALSO H. B. C. USE I THINK I'M NOT SURE I'M I'M MAY BE THE ONLY ONE OR ONE A FEW HERE WHO ACTUALLY I'M A GRADUATE OF AN H. B. C. U. VERY PROUD GRADUATE OF AN HBCU. I'M AND I'M ALSO VERY. GRATEFUL FOR THE FOUNDING OF TROLLS THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE THINGS THAT IT HAS DONE NOT ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT- I'M I'M ALSO VERY FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT HAVE- BONTA CHARLES DREW UNIVERSITY. UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS- AS A VERY PROUD H. B. C. U. ALARM WE ARE- WE KNOW THE PURPOSE OF H. B. C. USE WE KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THE FOUNDING WE ALSO KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT THE H. B. C. USE HAVE HAD OVER THE HUNDRED PLUS YEARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN THERE. WITH BEING UNDER RESOURCE THAN UNDERFUNDED- IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE FIVE TITLE THREE OF HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. CONGRESS OFFICIALLY DEFINED WHAT AN H. B. C. U. AS- AN H. B. C. U. IS A SCHOOL OF HIGHER LEARNING THAT WAS ACCREDITED AND ESTABLISHED ONE BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. AND WHOSE PRINCIPAL MISSION WAS THE EDUCATION OF BLACK AMERICANS MEDICAL SCHOOL DOES NOT FIT INTO EITHER ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. CHARLES STREET WAS ESTABLISHED IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. AND ITS SOLE MISSION WAS NOT THE EDUCATION OF BLACK AMERICANS IT WAS TO PROVIDE- A HEALTH RESOURCE FOR AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY WHICH WAS PART WHICH WAS AND STILL IS POTENTIALLY PREDOMINANTLY BLACK BUT UNLIKE YOUR- HAIRY OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL YEAR HOWARD MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU'RE MORE HOUSE MEDICAL SCHOOL WHOSE PRIMARY MISSION WAS TO. SERVICE AND- PROVIDE EDUCATION TO BLACK STUDENTS AT A TIME WHEN WE COULD NOT GO TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES- I'M CHARLES DREW WAS NOT FOUNDED UNDER THOSE PRINCIPLES AND IT WAS NOT FOUNDED IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU'VE GOT- YOU KNOW SAID THE UNIVERSITY OF FREEPORT THAT WAS GIVEN THAT H. B. C. U. DIED DIAGNOSIS OR TITLE OR WHATEVER AFTER NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE IT IS THE PART OF THE SEVEN UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY WAS DEEMED. AN HBCU IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY OR IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. SO- YOU KNOW AS A AS AN ALARM. I KNOW HOW WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR H. B. C. USE. GET THE PROPER FUNDING GET THE PROPER RECOGNITION- WE GET HIT UP ALL THE TIME BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OFTENTIMES THE DIVISION ONE SCHOOLS. BOB THAT PRODUCE A LOT OF MONEY FOR TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITIES. OUT WE OFTENTIMES DON'T HAVE THE GENERATIONAL WEALTH STREAM. OP FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE FROM THEIR ALARM- AND SO THIS MONEY IS SPECIFICALLY RESERVED AND THIS TITLE IS SPECIFICALLY RESERVED. FOR A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF UNIVERSITIES. AND BECAUSE CHARLES TRUTH DOES NOT FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY I CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY- BUT I DO APPRECIATE. THE DISCUSSION AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT STRUCTURE HAS DONE FOR LOS ANGELES AND FOR. THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- I'M DR WEBER'S COMMENTS- SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED- WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WE STAND ON THE CUSP OF WANT ONE THIS IS A RESOLUTION- AND THIS RESOLUTION- WE HOPE IS TRANSMITTED- TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO INCLUDE- AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL TRUST- TO INCLUDE THE DESIGNATION AS WAS STATED BY DOCTOR WEBER- THERE WAS IN FACT- ONE WHO WAS BROUGHT IN AFTER THE DATE THAT SHE HAD ARTICULATED- I THINK WE STAND ON A TIME WE CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY AND CHANGE HISTORY. ON CALIFORNIA HAS NO H. B. C. U. CALIFORNIA HAS NO OTHER JUST THAT NO OTHER INSTITUTION LIKE CHARLES DREW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY- BE A TRENDSETTER WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO SOLVE UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE SCIENCE AND ALSO IT'S NAMED AFTER A PIONEER DR- ONE WHOSE GREAT GODDAUGHTER WORKS- AT THE INSTITUTION- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WHEN I WAS WAS ELECTED TO THE UP TO FORTY THE NINETEEN I WAS ABLE TO GET A SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE'S BUDGET TO ASSIST CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN TERMS OF- CONTINUE TO BROADEN THEIR PERSPECTIVE- IN LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- PRESENTED A CHECK FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SO THEY CAN EXPAND THE CAMPUS WE STAND ON THE CUSP OF MAKING CHARLES UNIVERSITY- BIG SAVIOR OF THE WEST COAST WHERE IT WAS ALREADY ARTICULATED- BLACK AND BROWN I'M STUDENTS IN THE WATTS COMMUNITY ATTEND THERE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES- TO THE WATTS COMMUNITY IN THE GREATER COMMUNITY OF LOS ANGELES. IT STANDS DIRECTLY A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM MARTHA KING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WHERE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO GRADUATE FROM CHARLES UNIVERSITY- MEDICINE SCIENCE GO OVER DO THEIR RESIDENTS. AT MARK CAN COME HIGH. AND SO THAT SETS UP FOR SUCCESS IN THE END IN ADDITION TO THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC THE EPICENTER WAS MY COMMUNITY THE EPICENTER OF WHERE COBIT NINETEEN IT WAS HIT- IT WAS IN FACT MY COMMUNITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARM. OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST- THAT CAN GO TO THIS INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING AND BECOME THE MEDICAL EXPERTS THAT THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONTINUE TO- GRADUATE- MOVING FORWARD IF IN FACT ANOTHER- PANDEMIC WESTIE HIT- CALIFORNIA. I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO SAY. THAT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ONE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO- THE COMMUNITIES LIKE CHARLES LIKE- SKEWS ME THE WATTS COMMUNITY AND ALSO INSTITUTIONS LIKE CHARLES UNIVERSITY MEDICAL AND SCIENCE THAT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE THE EXAMPLE- THE MODERN DAY EXAMPLE- OF A SCHOOL THAT PROVIDES AND WELCOMES- BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS TO GO INTO MEDICINE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS INSTITUTION. HAS CONTINUED TO DO I MISS INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL IS VERY DIVERSE- AND ICE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS BASED ON- MY COMMENTS TODAY. THEY MISTER GIBSON. AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIS RESOLUTION FOR. I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. THE LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESTRIN BODY ASSOCIATIONS AND THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO RUN FOR STRATTON TRUSTEE. MANY STUDENTS OUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NEEDS ARE ARE.

FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE EARLIER THIS MONTH LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT OR L. A. CCD AND REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH THE AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES PLEADED WITH THE COLLEGE TO MAKE THEIR ONLINE SERVICES ACCOMMODATE TO BLIND STUDENTS BY ALLOWING SCREEN READING SOFTWARE.

ONE REASON THAT THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE IS DUE TO LACK OF. INTERACTION WITH THE CURRENT MINIMUM UNIT REQUIREMENTS IT IS AN INTENTIONALLY IT LEAVES OUT A MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM BEING MORE INVOLVED ON CAMPUS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST FIX THIS OUTDATED EDUCATION CODE REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT COLLEGES LIKE ELLIE CCD FROM LIMITING STUDENTS VOICES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNDER REPRESENTED.
