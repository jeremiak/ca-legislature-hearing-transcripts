THAT'S AYE OF MYSELF COME TO THE- BUT IT'S A FOR COMMITTEE AND ROOM FOUR FOUR SEVEN BUT FOR NOW WE WILL GET STARTED WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES ON THE AGENDA TODAY- WE WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE. UPDATE ON DCC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET CHANGE AND DEPARTMENT- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS FOR FIRST ITEM WILL RECEIVE AN UPDATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. DISCUSSED TWO OF THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET LET'S BEGIN IS- NICOLE ELLIOTT. ON THE ZOOM READY TO GO. ARE A GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. IN TASTIC HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS LET ME GET BEGAN BY THANKING THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENTS MY NAME IS NICOLE ELLIOTT HAD THIS DISTINCT HONOR OF SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEWLY FORMED DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. GIVE YOU A QUICK UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENT AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT WAS ESTABLISHED JULY TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE ON AB ONE FORTY ONE. THE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THREE SEPARATE CANNABIS PROGRAMS THAT RESIDED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. OUR VISION AS A DEPARTMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A SAFE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE CANNABIS MARKET THAT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE WHAT A CONSOLIDATED DEPARTMENT CAN DO IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE MORE EXPEDITED NATURE OF OUR WORK INCLUDES THE SWIFT ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEADERSHIP TEAM TO STABILIZE THE TRANSITION. AND AGGRESSIVE RECRUITING EFFORTS TO FILL OUR VACANCIES THE CONSOLIDATION OF THREE SETS OF REGULATIONS AND TO ONE THE LOCKET DISTRIBUTION OF A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOCAL GRANT PROGRAMS THE SEVENTEEN JURISDICTIONS. TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES TO ANNUAL LICENCES BY AMONG A VARIETY OF THINGS FUNDING THE COMPLETION OF LOCAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. I AM PROUD OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HEADWAY WE HAVE MADE YET I ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE MARKET WE DESIRE TO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THIS IN MIND THE DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY FOCUSING ITS ATTENTION ON ADDRESSING KEY UPCOMING MANDATES AND ENFORCEMENT AND OPERATIONAL NEEDS. OF NOTE OPERATIONALLY AND RELATED TO LICENSING CURRENTLY A LITTLE OVER 70% OF OUR LICENSEE POPULATION HOLDS A PROVISIONAL LICENSE WE ANTICIPATE THIS NUMBER TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE UPCOMING DEADLINE TO ISSUE PROVISIONAL. LICENSES TO NON EQUITY ACT LOOK. SO ASISTIR OF THE DEPARTMENT IS ENHANCING ITS FOCUS ON PROCESSING THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSURE. IN THE AREA OF ENFORCEMENT WE ARE FOCUSING ON HIRING STRATEGIC PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCED PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. ARE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IS TASKED WITH CONDUCTING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AND THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL SHERIFFS POLICE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHERE APPROPRIATE THIS TEAM ALSO WORKS WITH OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION TO INVESTIGATE WHAT WE CALL GREAT MARKET OPERATIONS OPERATIONS WHO WORK IN BOTH THE LEGAL AND ILLEGAL MARKETS. THIS JOINT EFFORT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO MORE SWIFTLY ADDRESSED THIS GRAY MARKET ACTIVITY ADMINISTRATIVELY AS WELL AS CRIMINALLY. OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE FOCUSED ON INCREASING HIRES IN THIS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AND THROUGH THIS FOCUS FOCUS EFFORTS WE'VE CUT OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION VACANCY RATE IN HALF. ALONGSIDE THESE PERSONAL EFFORTS THE DIVISION HAS ALSO CONDUCTED EIGHTY FOUR SEARCH WARRANT OPERATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TARGETING ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION OPERATIONS DISTRIBUTION MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL OPERATIONS. OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION COMPRISED OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE NON SWORN STAFF OVERSEES THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OF OUR LICENSED OPERATORS THEY DO THIS THROUGH CONDUCTING ROUTINE INSPECTIONS AND THROUGH ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS TO LICENSED AND UNLICENSED OPERATORS. SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT THE COMPLIANCE DIVISION HAS PERFORMED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED INSPECTIONS ISSUED THIRTEEN LICENSING ACTIONS FURTHERMORE THIS DIVISION HAS A DEDICATED TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. TO SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THEY PARTICIPATE IN INVESTIGATIONS OF ILLEGAL CULTIVATION OPERATIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TEAM HAS PARTICIPATED IN NINETY EIGHT INVESTIGATION ACTIONS LED BY THESE AGENCIES AND IS PURSUING THIRTY FOUR ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS. WE CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY HIRE STAFF ACROSS THESE DIVISIONS AS WELL AS OTHERS WHILE REALIGNING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. AS WE CONTINUE THIS WORK WE KEEP THERE ARE AYE ON THE ULTIMATE FUTURE STATE FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS A SAFE DISTANCE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE MARKET THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A SMART REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. THAT PRESERVES THE ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTS CONSUMER SAFETY AND SUSTAINS BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO DO THE SAME WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE BUDGET PROPOSALS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT FORTH. THAT BEGINS TO SET A STRONGER FOUNDATION FOR THIS FUTURE STATE PROPOSALS THAT BUILD ON OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CANNABIS BUSINESS AND LICENSING PROCESS HE'S DEVELOP POLICY UTILIZING ROBUST STATUS DATA. AND HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC AND CANNABIS CONSUMERS. OUR FIRST PROPOSAL IS A REQUEST FOR THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION TO FIND THREE DISTINCT PROJECTS FIRST BEGINNING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED LICENSING SYSTEM. THIS INCLUDES PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MAP BUSINESS NEEDS MIGRATE EXISTING LICENSING DATA AND DEVELOP AN ACQUISITION PLAN FOR ONE SINGLE LICENSING SYSTEM VERSUS THE THREE WE CURRENTLY USE. THE SECOND IS A CONSUMER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN THAT WILL PROVIDE CONSUMERS BOTH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED TO PURCHASE CANNABIS THROUGH THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKET. AND TO DETER USE OF UNTESTED UNSAFE PRODUCT OBTAINED FROM UNLICENSED SOURCES IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT RESPONSIBLE USE AND CONSUMPTION. AND LASTLY ACQUIRING SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS WHO CAN HELP THE DEPARTMENT AGGREGATE STORE AND CLEAN LICENSING AND COMPLIANCE DATA. INTERNALLY WILL BE BETTER SITUATED AS A DEPARTMENT TO UTILIZE THIS DATA INTERNALLY TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND BEGIN TO SHARE SOME OF THIS DATA EXTERNALLY TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND OTHER POLICY RELATED EFFORTS. THE SECOND REQUEST SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS FOR ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT SAMPLE TESTING SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLYBILL FORTY FIVE WITHOUT I WILL STOP HERE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF TAX REFORM ACTUALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO- ENFORCEMENT INVESTMENTS. YOU MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT EFFICIENT WILDLIFE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO THE ENTIRE TO THE ENTIRE. A NUMBER ON YOUR TEAM. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT- CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY WHAT YOU HAVE ON STAFF WHAT YOU MAY POTENTIALLY NEED. A RESOURCES PARTNERSHIPS WHAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL NEED TO IMPROVE ITS ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO- EBS ILLICIT AND ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET. ABSOLUTELY MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT IS FUNDED FOR- IT WITHIN THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION EIGHTY SEVEN POSITIONS I SEVENTY SEVEN OF WHICH ARE SWORN AND TEN OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTRATIVE AS I MENTIONED IN THE DEPARTMENTS FOCUSED AS SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS ON REDUCING THE VACANCY RATE THAT WAS 49% A DEPARTMENT ACT CREATION AYE SO NOW WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIFTY EIGHT SWORN POSITIONS FILLED WITH NINE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS FILLED AS WELL AND AREN'T AND ARE AT ROBUST HIRING EFFORTS CONTINUE IN THAT VEIN- WITH THAT SAID WE ARE. CURRENTLY ASSESSING ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AS YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL WORKING TO I USE ALL OF THOSE EXISTING RESOURCES THROUGH THINGS LIKE EXPANDING OUR HIRING HI HOWEVER IF WE FEEL LIKE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK TO YOU OF A FOR THE TIME BEING WE ARE DEVELOPING ACT WE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- STRENGTHEN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WORK MORE CLOSELY. WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AS FAR. THANK YOU FOR THE I- I REPRESENT THE OF LOS ANGELES AND ALSO UNINCORPORATED EAST LOS ANGELES. THE CITY OF LA HAS TAKEN REALLY GREAT MEASURES TO. CURB AND STOP JUST POP UP. ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS BUT THE COUNTY UNINCORPORATED EAST LOS ANGELES WHICH IS OPERATED BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME- MEASURES THAT THE CITY HAS HAD SO WE SEE A VERY. INEQUITABLE WAY IN WHICH SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE- SOME ILLEGAL POP MORE ILLEGAL POP UPS THAN MOST. SO I JUST WANNA PUT THAT ON YOUR RADAR IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU MAY NEED AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S NOT- SOMETHING THAT'S PERVASIVE ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I'LL JUST NOTE- WE DO HAVE AN INFORMAL PARTNERSHIP WITH LA DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS REGULATION SO WE CAN LEARN FROM THE ENFORCEMENT. WORK THAT THEY DO AS WELL AND FIND THAT FOR WORK OUTSIDE OF- THE MARKET AND WHICH DATE REGULATE- SO THANK YOU AND NOTED OKAY THANK YOU MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CHAT OFF YOU KNOW JUST N PARTICULAR.

OUR LAST ITEM IS A FIRE SOME INTO EXPERTS WHO CAN HELP THE DEPARTMENT IN AGGREGATING STORING AND CLEANING LICENSING DATA AND COMPLIANCE DATA. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO UTILIZE THIS DATA BOTH INTERNALLY TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND BEGIN TO SHARE SOME OF THIS DATA EXTERNALLY TO SUPPORT THIS BUSINESSES ACADEMIC RESEARCH AT AND OTHER POLICY RELATED EFFORTS. I'M OUR SECOND IS FOR REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT SAMPLE TESTING SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF AB FORTY FIVE ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU ONE QUESTION I JUST ONLY FOR ME BEFORE I TURN IT OVER BUT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO DO- ROLL CALL PLEASE MR SECRETARY WE CONTROL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREA PRESIDENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. RESIDENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NIGERIAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS. THANK YOU I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL IF YOU IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE PROPOSED AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROLS PROJECTED TARGET AUDIENCE AND WITH THE CAMPAIGN HAVE SPECIAL A SPECIFIC REGIONAL FOCUS WILL THE CAMPAIGN ALSO HAVE. A MULTI LINGUAL COMPONENT. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE. THAT SPOT ASSEMBLY WOMAN OUR CHAIR I. IT'S FAR AS THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF THE FIRST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN WOULD- INCLUDE IS PROPOSED TO INCLUDE A RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT. I TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET THE TARGET AUDIENCE WICH IS ALL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AS WELL AS TOURISTS. I SO IT WITH THAT IN MIND AND KNOWING THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REGIONAL VARIATIONS WELL AS A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO SEE. I DON AS PART OF THAT ASSESSMENT. AND IT TURNED IT OVER TO MEMBERS OF THE DIS MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MEASURE JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT FOR THAT MONEY FOR THE RICHER RESEARCH ASSESSMENT I MEAN. IT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING PROGRAM OR JUST A ONE TIME THING OR HOW THAT WORK. THEIR THEIR REQUEST FOR THE CAMPAIGN IS FOR ONE TIME PROJECTS IT. SO WHAT IS EXPECTED OF SPENDING SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON A CONSUMER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. SO ANY CHANCE OF THAT CAMPAIGN- HAS MULTIPLE FACETS- SOME OF THE KEY ONES ARE TO- EDUCATE CONSUMERS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY. OUR LEGAL RETAIL STORES DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ILLEGAL AND LEGAL STORES I'M I UNDERSTAND HOW TO LOOK AT PRODUCTS AND IDENTIFY THAT THEY ARE TESTED AS WELL AS PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE. LANGUAGES AND- ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS KNOW HOW TO- KEEP THEIR PRODUCTS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE I'M TO CHILDREN. SO THE TOBACCO HAS A HUGE ILLEGAL MARKET WE SEE OF WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE BALLISTICS IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THAT. COMES IN- TO CALIFORNIA. IF PEOPLE STILL BUY IN TOBACCO SAY I'M TRYING TO GET THE- WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE HERE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT MAKES HERE TOBACCO AT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME AND DESPITE THOSE CONSUMER PATTERNS WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING TO IT IS CONSUMER PATTERNS CONSUMPTION PATTERNS RELATED TO CANNABIS. WHICH IS A PRETTY NEW LEGAL MARKET INCLUDING THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MARKET AYE SO WE WANT TO DO OUR PART AS A STATE REGULATING ENTITY TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE SO THAT THEY ARE MAKING EDUCATED. PURCHASING I CHOICES AS WELL AS CONSUMPTION CHOICES. SO WHAT IS THE PART IN DOING A TO GO AFTER SHUT DOWN ILLEGAL RETAIL STORES. AND THE MORE RESOURCES TO SHUT DOWN THOSE ILLEGAL RETAILERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- AS I INDICATED IN MY COMMENTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS- TAKEN SOME STEPS OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS- TO ISSUE WARRANTS OR SUPPORT. OUR PARTNERS WHETHER THAT BE ON THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE STATE LINE OR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE. I RELATED TO ILLICIT OR ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS INCLUDING RETAIL THOSE EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE. DOES THAT MAKE MORE SENSE TO IDENTIFY THE ILLEGAL RETAIL STORES AND SHUT HIM DOWN. INTO THE SPENDING SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO CONVINCE CONSUMERS NOT TO BUY FROM THESE ILLEGAL OUTLETS. AS I'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY I THINK THAT THIS IS A MULTI FACETED EFFORTS THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BOTH ARE REQUIRED. BUT I THINK IT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WHEN THIS FIRST STARTED OFF A COUPLE YEARS AGO- WITH THE WITH THE COVETED. WE HAD A LOT OF ILLEGAL DEATH WITH VAPING IT WAS MARIJUANA VAPING FROM BLACK MARKET SO WE HAD AND- AS FAR AS I'M TOLD THAT STILL GOING ON. JUST LIKE THE ISSUES WITH THE- FIT IN ALL ITS JUST COVERT IS SUCKED ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE SPACE. SO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH THOSE DEATHS ARE UP- UNTIL WE STILL HAVE GUESTS FROM THE BLACK MARKET- VAPING. SO BUT SIX MORE DOLLARS GO A LOT FURTHER AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF ALICE OUT THERE SELLING RIGHT NOW. IN SHOWING THOSE OUTLETS DOWN. I THINK WE REQUIRE BOTH OF THOSE EFFORTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WITH A VALLEY THERE. WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER F THOSE PRODUCTS THAT WERE PURCHASED OFF OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET HOWEVER WE DID SEAT CONSUMER PATTERNS CHANGE- DURING A VALLEY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A PUBLIC- RIGHTS CAMPAIGN QUITE FRANKLY I RELATED TO THE HARM THAT THOSE PRODUCTS WERE CAUSING FOR CONSUMERS. SO ENSURING THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL IS IMPORTANT SO THAT THEIR PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS- LEGALLY AND CONSUMING PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED WHILE ALSO CAN CURRENTLY GOING ON- AND ENFORCING AGAINST THE RETAIL OPERATIONS IN THE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THAT ARE PRODUCING. THERE'S A LEGAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING BIG CARTRIDGES THAT ARE HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS. WILL THAT 506030% A MARIJUANA GROWING CALIFORNIA'S GONNA LEAVE ILLEGAL MARKET AS FAR AS RETAIL WHAT DO YOU NUMBERS. ON ILLEGAL RETAIL SHOPS WHAT PERCENTAGE. IT IS A GOOD QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE LEGAL RETAIL LOCATIONS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL RETAIL BECAUSE THE JURISDICTIONS HAVE. PROVIDE ARE PROHIBITED OP PATHWAYS TO REGULATED RETAIL FOR BUSINESSES IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON A SUPPORTING SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I AM CREATING PATHWAYS FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE LEGAL PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS WITHOUT PART OF PROP SIXTY FOUR NICHOLS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHATEVER SAY SO. WHEN THEY HAD CANNABIS IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT. SO IT IS STILL GOES BACK YOU CAN SPEND MONEY ON A PROBLEM. AND YET YOU DON'T KNOW THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. SO YOU CAN'T TELL ME USING US BEEN A FREE LEGAL RETAIL STORES. BUT YET YOU HAVE NO IDEA. HOW MANY ILLEGAL RESTORE RETAIL STORES ARE ARE SO FOR ME THAT IS DOESN'T JIVE. YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT STATEMENT I THINK AS IT RELATES TO SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS. I WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL I RETAIL OUTLETS STATEWIDE. I THAT'S A FLUID THAT'S A LIVING SORT OF- ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THOSE POP UP AND DISAPPEAR. I SO WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS RETAIL OUTLETS IT DOES CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY- BUT CONCURRENT TO THAT WE ALSO THINK IT'S- JUST EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT IS THE EAGLE AND WHAT IT'S NOT. BUT I STILL WANT TO PIN YOU DOWN THIS YOU HAVE OR NOT THEY'RE STILL THERE ARE SOME POINTS SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. DRILL DOWN DEEPER ON WHAT IS THAT UNIVERSE. IS A THOUSAND IS FIVE THOUSAND IS A COUPLE HUNDRED I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME IDEA. FOR THE OTHERWISE OU TIME YOU HAVE ZERO IDEA WHATSOEVER. SO HOW ARE YOU IT WILL BE A METRIC WILL YOUR MATTRESS MEASURING THAT PAUL. IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY HOW MANY ILLEGAL RETAIL OUTLETS THERE ARE PARTNERS INCLUDING STATE PARTNERS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO IDENTIFY THOSE ILLEGAL RETAIL LOCATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE- I'M ADDS THAT IS AN ONGOING EFFORT. BUT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME SO I WOULD THINK THEM. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WITH THIS ISSUE. SO I THINK AT SOME POINT. I'M NOT TRYING TO BELABOR THE POINT. YOU HAVE SOME NUMBERS SOMEHOW SOME WAY. AND I SPENT TEN YEARS NARCOTICS WORKING NARCOTICS I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS. FULL EXIT WE GOTTA GET OUR ARMS AROUND THE PROBLEM SO. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SPENDING MONEY ON ITEMS BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND YOU DON'T OTHER THAN TELLING US. IT'S ILLEGAL RETAIL STORES WITH THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE NO IDEA. THAT'S THAT'S WHY I'M HERE YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE WHAT WELL HAVING WORKED IN NARCOTICS I THINK YOU KNOW QUITE WELL THAT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OFTEN RETAIL OPERATIONS TO RECEIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND THEN POP BACK UP SO LIKE I SAID IT IS A LIVING POPULATION OF THE LEGAL RETAILERS THAT IS FLUID IT CONTINUES TO EBB AND FLOW- BUT WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS OUR STATE PARTNERS INCLUDING CD TFA TO IDENTIFY. I ILLEGAL RETAIL OUTLETS AND ADDRESS THOSE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- I ANTICIPATE THIS WILL BE A LONG EFFORT NOT BECAUSE THE TRANSITION OF A VERY OLD VERY LARGE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED MARKET IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. I'M AS THE POPULATION OF THE LEGAL RETAIL WILL BE A PART OF THAT EFFORT AND AN ONGOING BASIS INCLUDING IDENTIFYING WHERE THOSE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS ARE AS THEY POP UP AND AS THEY DISAPPEAR. BUT STILL EVEN HAVING NUMBERS TO POP UP ON THE PUBLIC NUMBERS YOU KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE FOR THE POP UPS. BECAUSE BE A POP OF TO MOVE FROM ONE LOCATION OTHER BUT HOW MANY PLACES MEN SHOT DOWN HOW MANY WORDS I MEAN GIVE ME SOME NUMBER BECAUSE OTHERWISE. IT IT REALLY IS IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR YOU ASKING FOR THE MONEY AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THEIR POP UPS. YOU CAN'T PIN THAT DOWN. AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME WAY THROUGH SEARCH WARRANTS THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS. AND MOST AS INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT DONE BY THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THEIR DOUBLE YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME WAY TO CAPTURE THESE NUMBERS. IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA. SO IT IS STILL COMES BACK FROM THE MIDDLE THE- THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THIS MONEY. BUT YOU CAN'T QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM WE GOT A PROBLEM WE'LL HAVE BIGGER PROBLEM IS. IT I DON'T. ACCEPT THAT POP UP EVERYTHING IS NOT A POP UP. USED TO BRICK AND MORTAR PLACES THAT STAY IN BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME. SEOUL IS POP UPS CAN EVEN TELL ME THAT. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT SINCE DEPARTMENT'S CREATION WE HAVE ISSUED OR SUPPORTED EIGHTY FOUR SEARCH WARRANTS TWENTY FOUR OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ON RETAIL SINCE. THIS INST ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGAL COMMERCIAL MARKET AND THERE HAS BEEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE SEARCH WARRANTS ON ILLEGAL RETAIL THAT. THAT TELLS ME THAT'S BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A LOCAL JURISDICTION EVEN HERE SACRAMENTO WHERE IS THE IS THE FIFTH LARGEST COUNTY AND THEY DO THAT RESEARCH ONCE IN ONE COUNTY SO IF THAT'S THE MOST NOT YOU'VE DONE STATEWIDE. THAT IS ABYSMAL. EMPIRE THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT FOR THE FOR THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHATSOEVER. THERE IS ZERO FOR SMITH IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT. GETTING LICENSES AND GETTING PEOPLE UP AND RUNNING AND WE KNOW THE BLACK MARKET IS A BIG PROBLEM IS NEVER BEEN TACKLED SO FOR THOSE NUMBER OF WARRANTS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. THOSE ARE MINUSCULE THAT IS ABYSMAL TO DO THAT SO I'M NOT GONNA BELIEVE THE POINT BUT I'M DONE BUT- YOU GUYS HAVE TO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS JUST A TO GIVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR YOU GUYS TO GO OFTEN AND TRY THIS IT JUST DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME. WELL I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK OF OUR SWORN STAFF- ON THEIR WARRANT ISSUANCE AND THAT- THE FOCUS ON. RETAIL WILL CONTINUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOWEVER WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO A CONCURRENT WITH THAT FOCUS. ADDITIONAL THINGS LIKE SUPPORTING. PATHWAYS TO LICENSURE AS WELL AS CONSUMER EDUCATION OFFICE HE SPOKE ABOUT HER SUPPORT STAFF SALARIES FOR STAFF DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE. FIFTY EIGHT SMART IN THE STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT IS ONE PERSON FOR COUNTY SO THE MAJORITY THIS WORK IS BEING DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE NOT THE STATE LEVEL AND THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE EXPERTISE LIES WITH THOSE LOCAL INVESTIGATORS NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND I THINK WE CAN CARE WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH IS WHY THE MAJORITY OF OUR WARRANTS ARE H. OURS ARE DONE IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL EFFORTS. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU YORK- LACKING FROM THE FRONT- THE WAS X. AND THE LACK OF APPETITE ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE- CERTAINLY THERE. WE TRULY KNOW THAT THE ILLICIT MARKET THERE'S CLEARLY OVERPOWERING THE LEGITIMATE MARKET AND I SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME EFFORTS HERE TO TRY TO. CORRECT THAT TO SOME DEGREE BUT- THAT THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECT ESPECIALLY IN THE DISTRICT I LOVE. NOT SO MUCH IN THE RETAIL SPACE BUT AND THE- THE GROW. THE ACT ILICIC GROWS THAT WE HAVE OUT IN THE DESERT ARE ALARMING. AND- WAY OVERPOWERING. AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S MUCH OF AN APPETITE TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT- THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL ASPECT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT- YOUR DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN TRYING TO PARTNER WITH WITH THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO CURB. AND TO ELIMINATE THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE CANNABIS MARKET IT TRULY IS A HEARTBREAK TO KNOW THAT- THERE ARE PLENTY WHO ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW BY THE RULES AND PLAY BY THE RULES AND THEY- THEY EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TRY TO BE IN COMPLIANCE AND- THE DISTINCTION EVEN AT THE RETAIL LEVEL AS BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUE. IS ALSO VERY- DISARMING. AND I THINK YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT THOUGH THAT THE CONSUMER OFTEN. HAS A HARD TIME DISCRIMINATING. UPSIDE A PRICE- BECAUSE THE PRICE ADVANTAGE IN THE ILLICIT MARKET AS YOU KNOW. AS ARE NOT CLOSE TO COMPETING AT HAS AN EXTREME AND MANAGE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S DOING SO WELL. SO ANYWAYS I THINK THE LACK OF APPETITE FOR FORSMAN IS DISCOURAGING BUT- I'M HOPING THAT- WE CAN WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND I'LL JUST- I'LL JUST ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION REGULARLY PARTNERS WITH THE SAN BERNADINO SHERIFF'S ON OPERATION HAMMER STRIKE I BELIEVE ON A WEEKLY BASIS AS WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OCCURRING I IN THE COUNTY AND HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO A ISSUE NUMBER TWO. OUT WE WILL- GO TO BE ON CAMPUS TAX REFORM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS CANNABIS TAX REFORM. AND PLANS TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS. TAX POLICY TO HELP STABILIZE THE MARKET. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL BILLS INTRODUCED RECENTLY IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE ADDRESSING. CANNABIS TAXATION TODAY THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL RECEIVE WILL RECEIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IN HERE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR REFORM AND MY APOLOGIES ONE MOMENTS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO- LET ME JUST FOR- TO INSURE THAT WE HEAR ALL OF IT- I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND FROM LA- IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENT. TWO ONE MY APOLOGIES AND MOVING TOO QUICKLY ON ISSUE TO. FINANCE KILEY MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROLS PROPOSALS WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR THE PLANNING FOR UNIFIED CANNABIS LICENSING AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEM THE CONSUMER. WELL AS TESTING AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTS THANK YOU THANK YOU L. L. I JUST COMPUTERS CABALLERO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE TO BCPS FOR BERMAN CANNABIS CONTROL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN MY APOLOGIES AND I'M MOVING ON TO ISSUE TOO AS MENTIONED TODAY THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL RECEIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE AND CALIFORNIA AND HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUTPOSSIBLE AVENUES. OF REFORM OUT OF THE FIRST WILL BE A MISTER KIRSTEN LET'S START WITH YOUR PRESENTATION PLEASE. THANK YOU VERYMUCH I'M SET CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO ACCOMPANY MY TESTIMONY TODAY WE'VE DISTRIBUTED A BRIEF HAND AT. WHICH I WILL START SHARING ON MY SCREEN NOW OR SHORTLY WHEN I'M GRANTED PERMISSION. OUR MOST ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA HERE WE GO OKAY SO GO AHEAD AND SHARE. YEAH SHARE MY SCREEN JUST A MOMENT SHE. SO YOU CAN SEE THE FILE THEN I'LL PUT IT ON FULL SCREEN OF CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAXES COME FROM TO LAWS- NOTED HERE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WHICH THE VOTERS PASSED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND S. B. NINETY FOUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AB PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES A RETAIL EXCISE TAX WHICH RAISES ABOUT 80% OF THE REVENUE THAT GOES INTO THE CANNABIS TAX FUND IN A CULTIVATION TAX WHICH RAISES THE REMAINING 20% AS SHOWN IN THIS FIGURE HERE. REVENUE FROM THESE TAXES INITIALLY WAS PRETTY WEAK- JUST IN THE IN THE MADE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER QUARTER BUT THEN GREW QUITE RAPIDLY FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REVENUES GREW REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE LAST FEW QUARTERS AS YOU CAN SEE HAS BEEN MUCH SLOWER. NEXT WE WILL COVER SOME OF THE BASIC FEATURES OF STATE AND LOCAL CANNABIS TAXES AND CALIFORNIA. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR SET THE STATE'S EXCISE TAX RATE AT 15% OF THE RETAIL PRICE. SB NINETY FOUR MOVED THE REMITTANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TAX FROM RETAILERS TO DISTRIBUTORS. BUT WHEN RETAILERS BUY CANNABIS PRODUCTS FROM DISTRIBUTORS NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT THE ULTIMATE RETAIL PRICE WILL BE SO TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR DISTRIBUTORS TO REMIT THE TAX SB NINETY FOUR EFFECTIVELY TURNS THEIR SO CALLED RETAIL TAX INTO A WHOLE SALES TAX. THE STATUTE DIRECTS THE DEPARTMEN OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO ESTIMATE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RETAIL MARKET. AND THEY USE THAT NUMBER TO ESTIMATE THE WHOLESALE TAX RATE IT'S EQUIVALENT ON AVERAGE TO A 15% RETAIL TAX RIGHT NOW THAT TAX RATE IS. 27% OF THE WHOLESALE PRICE. THE OTHER STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES THE CULTIVATION TAX THIS TAX IS A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT PER IN HOUSE WITH DIFFERENT RATES FOR THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF HARVESTED CANNABIS. PROP SIXTY FOUR ESTABLISHED AN ANNUAL INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE TAX RATES AND THAT KEEPS THE REAL TAX RATE CONSTANT OVER THE LONG TERM. SB NINETY FOUR MADE DISTRIBUTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR REMITTING THIS TAX TO THE STATE JUST AS IT DID FOR THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX. THE THIRD MAJOR PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS THE CANNABIS TAXES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE ON BUSINESSES ALL UP AND DOWN THE CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL STATEWIDE AVERAGE LOCAL CANNABIS TAX WAIT RATE WAS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT. TO A 14% TAX ON RETAIL SALES. NOW I'LL SHOW YOU A FIGURE HERE. THE ILLUSTRATES THE FLOW AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR THE TWO STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES BUSINESSES MAKE TAX PAYMENTS TO THE STATE AS YOU CAN SEE THE FIGURE WE HAVE TAX PAYMENTS FROM BUSINESSES TO OTHER BUSINESSES AND THEN IN THAT CASE THE CULTIVATION TAX SOMETIMES ONCE OR TWICE MORE TO OTHER BUSINESSES AND OTHER BUSINESSES BEFORE THEY EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR WAY TO. THE STATE. AND I'LL WRAP UP MY REMARKS BY HIGHLIGHTING A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORT OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECT A SEQUENCE OF THREE MAJOR POLICY CHOICES FIRST THERE'S THE CHOICE OF WHAT TYPE OF TAX TO LEVY. OUR PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION WAS TO REPLACE THE STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES WITH A POTENCY BASED OR CHEERED AT VALOREM TAX ALTERNATIVELY IF EASE OF ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE IS THE TOP PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE COULD. STICK WITH THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX EITHER WAY WE RECOMMENDED ELIMINATING THE CULTIVATION TAX. SECOND WE RECOMMENDED COLLECTING TAXES FROM BUSINESSES THAT PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN WHATEVER ACTIVITY IS BEING TAXED. THAT WOULD MEAN FOR EXAMPLE COLLECTING THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX FOR RETAILERS RATHER THAN DISTRIBUTORS. AND THIRD WE NOTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REASONABLY COULD CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF TAX RATE. I CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU MISTER CONSTANT LET'S MOVE TO DIRECTOR MODELS FOR HIS PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME COMMITTEE MY NAME'S NICK MOTORISTS AND- DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND THERE ARE THREE TAXES MR PERSON SAID THERE TO SPECIFICALLY AROUND CANNABIS BUT THERE ARE THREE IN OUR VIEW THAT- STATE TAXES ON CANNABIS. IN WE ADMINISTER ALL THREE OF THOSE THE CULTIVATION AND EXCISE TAXES WHICH JUST HEARD ABOUT AS WELL AS THE SALES AND USE TAX FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THESE THREE TAXES TOGETHER BROUGHT IN JUST SHY OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. AND THAT FIGURE INCLUDES- A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION SALES AND USE TAX ACTUALLY GOES BACK- TO MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE STATE- AND SO THAT INCLUDES THOSE FIGURES THAT'S NOT ALL STATE REVENUE- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT TAX RATES IN THE TAX RATES ON CANNABIS BEING TOO HIGH AND CD TFA. IS THAT GNOSTIC ON THAT QUESTION- WE WILL ADMINISTER THE TAXES AS YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR- I. SEE FIT AND SET THE POLICY. AB THE RATES HOW. I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE- ARE TWO IMPORTANT GENERAL TAX PRINCIPLES- THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER ANY POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS- TO THE STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES. FIRST TAXES SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AT C. D. T. F. A. WE ADMINISTER THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I CAN CONFIRM WHAT MANY IF YOU ALREADY SUSPECT. TAXES ARE COMPLICATED. BUT EVEN IN- THAT WORLD COMPLICATED TAXES CALIFORNIA'S CAMPUS TAXES ARE PARTICULARLY COMPLEX AND THAT COMPLEXITY. NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAXES AND IT ADDS A BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE AND IF YOU'RE INTO THE POOLS. MIGHT BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THOSE COMPLEXITIES I'M IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THE SECOND PORTENT POINT I THAT I THINK- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND. IS THAT THE TAX STRUCTURE SHOULD BE FAIR TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLYING AS YOU HAVE ALREADY- BIRD TODAY. CALIFORNIA FACES THIS- A PROBLEM OF NON COMPLIANCE I IN THE CANNABIS SPACED. AND WE AT CD TFA FREQUENTLY HEAR FROM LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT THEY ARE BEING UNDERCUT BY THOSE BUSINESSES OPERATING OFTEN OPERATING TOTALLY OUT IN THE OPEN- OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL MARKET. AND TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE MARKET I IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF TAX CHANGES INCLUDE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATORS FROM EXPLOITING ANY UNFAIR TAX ADVANTAGE- I THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE WAYS TO DO THIS EVEN JUST EXPECT EXTENDING MANY OF THE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES THAT WE HAVE FOR SALES AND USE TAX FOR INSTANCE. TO THE CANNABIS TAXES WOULD HELP GREATLY- AS WE TRY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND CLOSE DOWN ILLEGAL OPERATORS ANYWAY THOSE ARE THE TWO- CONSIDERATIONS THAT I WOULD. SUGGEST YOU KEEP IN MIND AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER MOTHER DOES WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF KIND OF A CONTROL A DIRECTOR ELLIOT ARE YOU ABLE TO SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S VERSION FOR CANNABIS TAX REFORM THIS YEAR. SO I'M NOT ABLE TO SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S VERSION BUT I WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS A FEW THINGS ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS APPROACHING THE ISSUE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. SURE GO AHEAD OKAY GREAT AS YOU KNOW WE DO NOT SET TAX RULES OR BATES THAT'S UP TO YOU GUYS IN THE VOTERS AND WE DO NOT ADMINISTER COLLECT TAXES THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MR MATATUS ADDS THAT DIRECTOR OF C. T. F. THANK HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH DCC IS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO SHARE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM LICENSEES ON IMPACTS OF THE TAX STRUCTURE- AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON TAX REFORM TO SOME EXTENT. OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING THE MOST OBVIOUS COMPLAINT TAXES ARE HIGH AT LICENSEES ARE ALSO SHARING WITH US HOW THE TAX STRUCTURE POSES SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE TOLD THAT THE IMPOSITION OF A FIXED TAX RATE ON CULTIVATORS RATES TIED TO OVERALL INFLATION I DID NOT APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER AGRICULTURAL MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THEREFORE THIS TAX POLICY HAS BEEN TO AN EQUALLY BURDEN FARMERS PARTICULARLY CALIFORNIA SMALL FARMERS. IMPOSITION OF MULTIPLE TAXES FOCUSED ON MULTIPLE POINTS AND THE CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN OUT MAKES THE SYSTEM UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED AND ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE STRUCTURE AS DIRECTOR MURDER US MENTIONED TO CAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR OPERATORS TO TRACK TAXES OWED AND KATE RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR SOME TO EXPAND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO REMAIN COMPLIANT. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IN WHICH BUSINESSES AND A CASH BASED INDUSTRY WITHOUT READY ACCESS TO CAPITAL ARE ASKED TO PAY ESTIMATED TAXES IN ADVANCE AND SEEK REPAYMENT LATER IS ESPECIALLY BURDENSOME FOR SMALLER OPERATORS WITH FEWER EGAN. THIS INCLUDING. OUR EQUITY OPERATORS. INSIDERY NEED STRUGGLE SHARED BY LICENSEE WE CAN. WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SHARED SENTIMENT FOR. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP MVING KEEP OPERATORS AND CONSUMERS IN THE REGULATED MARKET. ALTHOUGH WE ARE JOINING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBER OFFICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITIONS ON TAX REFORM. AND WE BEGAN REVIEWING THE RECENT TAX PROPOSALS THAT YOU MENTIONED WE'RE JUST AFFORD I'M BY YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS INDICATED THAT IT PLANS TO BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE AN INDUSTRY WITH A GOAL OF IDENTIFYING A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE TAX REFORM SOLUTION THAT WILL HELP STABILIZE THE INDUSTRY. WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WHICH PROMISED VOTERS REVENUE FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE MARKET. DISEASE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THE ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT OF TAX POLICIES THAT PROMOTE EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND THAT STABILIZE THE MARKET. WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE WILL MOST DEFINITELY BE ASKING QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE WE DO IS THERE ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FINALLY MAKING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO INTO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DÍAS HAVE SOME JUST A POOR FINANCES ARE A TIMELINE FOR WHEN WE WILL SEE A POTENTIL TAX REFORM PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. SURELY MANY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE LATER THIS SPRING. CAN YOU GIVE ME A- MONTH TO DATE BY SPRING YOU MEAN ONE. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC THE. OKAY AT THIS IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING PART IN A FINANCE ALSO WERE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL TOGETHER SO- CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING AND WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU LATER THIS SPRING WE DON'T HAVE A- DATE CERTAIN YET. OKAY PLEASE SON JUST KNOW THAT. HAVING THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS. COMMITTEE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON. WHETHER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT A PROPOSALS COMING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND SO THAT WE CAN. DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CONVEY THAT TO OUR COLLEAGUES AS WELL. THAT THANK YOU. I HAD SOME QUESTIONS IN GENERAL AND THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL THE PRESENTERS- WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS IN CAMPUS TAX REVENUE. CHARLIE MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO FLUCTUATIONS AT THIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAX REVENUES ARE GENERALLY DIFFERENT DRIVEN BY OVERALL. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND MARKET PRICES. THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT CDFA I WOULD SAY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED- RELATIVELY EARLY ON THAT CAUSED AN INCREASE IN TAX REVENUE WAS THE ADJUSTMENT- THE- MARK UP. FROM 60% TO EIGHTY PERCENT- BECAUSE AS THIS MISTER BURSTING I EXPLAINED BETWEEN THE TIME OF PROP SIXTY FOUR S. B. NINETY FOUR THERE WAS THIS CHANGE- FROM THE 15% TAX RETAIL- TO- TO. MOVING THE INCIDENCE OF THE TAX TO THE DISTRIBUTOR- WE EAT EVERY SIX MONTHS AND CITY CHIEF I CALCULATE BASED ON SIMPLY ON A TRACK AND TRACE DATA- THE AVERAGE STATEWIDE MARKUP BETWEEN WHOLESALE AND RETAIL- THAT THE SET NATIONALLY IT'S 60% WHEN IT MOVED 280% THAT DID- BECAUSE AN INCREASE IN. TAX REVENUE- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. I DO THINK IN ADDITION TO THE- IDMS MENTION BY THE PARTNER FINANCED THAT THE AMOUNT OF- CONSUMPTION THAT GOES TO THE LEGAL MARKET VERSUS THE ILLEGAL MARKET CERTAINLY PLAYS A ROLE. WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE- DO YOU FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK THAT'S THE CRITICAL POINT THAT MR COOPER WAS MAKING EARLIER IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO SHUT DOWN THE LEGAL MARKET SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON. UP YOU KNOW WHAT THE REST OF IT COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE AND HOW AT THE END OF THE DAY- THE DEPARTMENT IS BETTER RESOURCE- ARE. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD MAKE JUST THAT IF I MAY JUST ADVENTURE- TO MR COOPER'S EARLIER COMMENTS- YOU KNOW IT. ECC IS NOT THE ONLY SB AUTHOR THE STATE LEVEL TRYING TO WORK ON ENFORCEMENT WE ARE AS WELL WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING EVERY DAY ALL AROUND THE STATE- THIS FISCAL YEAR AT LEAST THROUGH LAST WEEK I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS THROUGH- RIGHT. NOW WE HAD PERFORMED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE INSPECTIONS THIS FISCAL YEAR OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES- WITH AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE BUSINESSES- VISITED OR OBSERVE CLOSER BY OUR AND OUR- TAX SPECIALISTS RATHER THAN OUR- OFFICERS ARE RESULTING IN A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX SEIZURES OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS- AND WE DO TRY TO KEEP TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. LIST OF- ILLEGAL OPERATING- BUSINESSES ALL AROUND THE STATE AND- YEAH DISCUSS ALL OF THOSE HERE- I WOULD JUST- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED OR WANT MORE DETAIL- WE'D BE HAPPY TO. PROVIDE YOU WITH WHAT WE CAN. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MEASURE- ALLOCATION THROUGH THE CANNABIS TAX ONE. INCLUDES YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION. EARLY AFTER INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT. HOW MUCH OF YOU THEY CAN'T RECEIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. MISTER COOPER THIS IS KIMBERLY HARVESTED APARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE GOT THE NUMBERS FOR THAT- SO FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT THE END GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR THE YOUTH EDUCATION BUDGET IS FOUR HUNDRED ONE. POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. YEAH. FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND WHAT WHAT WAS IT FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- I WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY LET ME LOOK IN THE- LEAVE IT ON THE AGENDA. AT TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT'S TWO HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION FORTY SEVEN MILLION. YEAH. THIRTY MILLION SEVEN THOUSAND OKAY TWO TWO OKAY MILLION OKAY CHECKS ON IF IT'S HELPFUL THE CHARGES ON PAGE NINETEEN OF THE AGENDA WITH ALL THE YEARS OF THE DOLLARS. SIX OVER FOR THAT FLOWS TO THE MOTORCYCLES OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHAT PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED AND- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR THE YOUTH CAL. WE'VE GOT THEM CDPH SURVEILLANCE EDUCATION ACTIVITIES SOCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES FOR ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE- AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS. FOR WHAT ACCESS. FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS WHAT WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL THESE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO GET LICENSES OR WHAT. AND THAT'S IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES THERE IS A THAT'S OUTSIDE MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. OKAY DO WE ALSO DO IS- LIST SOMEWHERE OF PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED. AND HOW MUCH EACH PROGRAM RECEIVED. WE CAN PUT ONE TOGETHER FOR YES THAT WOULD BE NICE THANK YOU- DO YOU KNOW HOW THESE PROGRAMS WERE SELECTED- TWEET IT'S MY TIME ON SIGN UP BUT WE CAN FIND OUT I KNOW THAT THE BUCKETS. SO THE ALLOCATION THREE BUCKET OF YOUTH- EDUCATION AS EXPERTS AT THAT SET IN PROP. SIXTY FOUR. THEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION PART IS 20% AND THEN STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GETS FINAL TWENTY PERCENT. AND THEN WITHIN THOSE PERCENTAGES THERE ARE. SMALLER DIVISIONS. AND THEN WHAT LESLIE ON MY LAST QUESTION IS WHAT DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR AWARDING THE FUNDING. VISA BEEN FAIRLY STATIC THOUGH SINCE THE BEGINNING. OKAY CUSTOMER LIST OF WHAT DEPARTMENT SO. CHUCK OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OR FOUR ITEMS TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY MISTER COOPER IMPORTANT. ARE THERE OTHER LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CANNABIS US TAX STRUCTURES AND OTHER STATES. SEP BURSTING WITH THE L. A. **** MAYBE I'LL JUST START BY DOING A REAL QUICK SKETCH OF WHAT CANNABIS AX STRUCTURES AND OTHER STATES LOOK LIKE- THE MOST COMMON TYPE IS- IS THIS SORT OF BY PERCENTAGE OF RETAIL RETAIL PRICE SO WE CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX THAT'S- I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY IF IT WERE COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM THE RETAILER THAT WOULD LOOK AT PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE MOST COMMON TYPE. OF STATE AND LOCAL CANNABIS TAX ADMINISTERED IN OTHER STATES- FAR LESS COMMONLY AND THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF TAXES SUCH AS- A WEIGHT BASED TAX CULTIVATION TAXES LIKE THE ONE WE HAVE HERE THEIR COUPLE STATES THAT HAVE THAT- ILLINOIS HE HAS A TAX THAT IS. HERE BASED ON THE POTENCY OF THE PRODUCT. NEW YORK IN ABOUT A MONTH IS GONNA BE ROLLING OUT A- A- IT. IS TO BE ROLLING OUT ATTACK THAT IS- POTENCY BASED SORT OF LIKE THE ONE WE DISCUSSED IN OUR REPORT THAT'S ANOTHER TYPE IT'S OUT THERE- SO THAT'S IT WITH REGARD TO SIR STATE LEVEL TAXES THAT'S SORT OF AN OVERVIEW. ONE STRIKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES WITH LEGAL CANNABIS IS HOW WE APPROACH LOCAL TAXATION SO MOST OTHER STATES. ARE PLACED AT A FAIR BIT OF- LIMITS OR RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN TAX CANNABIS AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO THAT PRETTY MUCH THE LOCALS ARE. ARE PERMITTED TO TAX AS THEY WISH- AND SO ARE THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU TEND TO SEE IN OTHER STATES IS TYPICALLY LIMITING LOCAL TAXATION OF CANNABIS TO THE RETAIL LEVEL ON- THE ONLY OTHER STATE THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THAT ALLOWS TAXES ON OTHER TYPES OF NON RETAIL CANNABIS BUSINESSES IS. ILLINOIS AND EVEN THEN THEY DO CAP RATES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN LET THE STAFF JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW AS FAR AS LESSONS LEARNED- THE ONE MAJOR CANNABIS TAX REFORM IN OTHER STATES THAT WE'RE AWARE OF IT IS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND WASHINGTON. WHAT THEY USED TO HAVE WAS THEY HAD- TAXES THAT WORK PERCENTAGE OF THE PRICE AT A VARIETY OF OUR- DIFFERENT LEVELS STAGES OF PRODUCTION DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY DID NOT SIMPLIFY THEIR SYSTEM TO ARE THEY ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED THE TAXES OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INCREASES THE RATE AT THE- RETAIL LEVEL SO THAT SORT OF DAY I THINK THEY DID FIND THAT. PRIOR SYSTEM TO BE- UNDESIRABLE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS CERTAINLY THERE'S THE COMPLEXITY ASPECT BUT. ALSO- I THINK THAT THE I THAT IT I. CREATE A- I. AN ADVANTAGE FOR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED BUSINESSES THAT POSSIBLY DUE TO TAX STRUCTURE. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- MISTER LUCKY. IT'S JUST A KIND OF A COMMENT AND THEN A- A QUESTION REAL QUICKLY. MY BELIEVE THAT IS. THAT THE GOAL OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS TO TAKE CANNABIS PRODUCTION OF CELLS OUT OF THE HANDS THE ONLY. THE ILLEGAL MARKET THAT IS NECESSARY AND WE HEARD THIS EXPRESSED EARLIER. FOR THE LEGAL MARKET TO BE FAIRLY TAXED AND OPERATE IN A SIMPLIFIED COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING SYSTEM- AND IT ALSO HAS TO BE SUBJECT TO INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT. THAT COULD BE CARRIED OUT RELATIVELY SIMPLE THESE ACTIONS CANNOT. CANNOT OCCUR UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS. IF THERE'S TO BE A CANNABIS TAX REFORM WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW THE IMPACT. THAT THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY THAT'S THE SOURCE OF THE CANNABIS TAX FUND AND THE PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON ITS FUNDING HOW WOULD THAT LOOK AT I HEAR THAT YOU- VOICE A BIT OF FRUSTRATION THAT- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD TAX AT ANY LEVEL AND I SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A BIG APPETITE TO- TAX THE COMPETITIVE NATURE. OF THE LEGAL MARKET RIGHT OUT OF THE PICTURE AND I THINK TO SOME DEGREE THAT'S WHAT OUR PROBLEM. IS CURRENTLY WOULD YOU SHARE THAT VIEW. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK- IT IT'S- THERE'S CERTAINLY A VARIETY OF FACTORS AT PLAY WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE- AND- CHALLENGES FACING- THE LICENSED CANNABIS INDUSTRY I THINK YOU YOU'VE IN YOUR REMARKS IDENTIFIED A FEW AS WELL AS SORT OF GET THE EARLIER DISCUSSION IN HEARING- I. WOULD SAY THERE IS- AT. OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT I DID EXAMINE ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE WHICH WAS THEIR STATEWIDE TAXES WITCHER'S STORED AT A FAIR BIT OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING NOW AND DID FIND THAT- LOWER STATEWIDE TAX RATES WOULD- MAKE THE- I SINCE MARKET MORE COMPETITIVE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF OTHER POLICY OPTIONS BAKER THAT PUTS THINGS IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL. THANK YOU I JUST THINK IT'S THAT DESERVES TO BE STATED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT THE THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE ONES TO GET MORE. ENFORCEMENT AND I FIND THAT TO BE AN ENIGMA WHEN. THOSE WHO ARE IN THE ILLICIT SPACE SEEM TO HAVE A LOT MORE FREEDOM OF ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A- MISGUIDED AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND- SIMPLIFYING. OUR TAX STRUCTURE AND- ALLOWING ARE THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY AND RECOGNIZE THAT AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALIFORNIA HELD THE- JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S NO ONE ON THAT ADDITIONAL PANEL THE HOW TO COMMENT. SEEING NONE OKAY.

THIS IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET AS WELL. OUR COUNCIL PROHIBITED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR ARTS COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. THIS PIVOT INCLUDES A PRIORITIZATION ON RACIAL EQUITY WHICH WE RECOGNIZED AS A PERVASIVE AND TRANSFORM OF INJUSTICE NOT JUST TO THE ARTISTS WE SERVICE TO EVERYONE. THE EXPANSION OF OUR CULTURAL DISTRICTS PRIORITIZE THE ECONOMIC INCLUSION OF BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS OF COLOR FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY BUILDING AND NURTURING CULTURAL IDENTITY AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH CITY GOVERNMENT BUSINESS WHILE PREVENTING DISPLACEMENT.

AND HOW THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT REALLY ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR THE PROGRAM I'M IN PARTICULAR AT THE ARTS COUNCIL HAS NOT PROVIDED INFORMATION ON HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING DISTRICTS AND NEW DISTRICTS I'M THE AND COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALLOWABLE USES AT THE FANS THE CRATER ANYWAY USED TO AWARD GRANTS- THROUGH THIS PROGRAM NOW WHAT- MEASURABLE GOALS OR OUTCOMES WOULD BE THOUGHT BY THAT CONVERTS ON HOW THOSE TO BE. DIE COUNCIL HAS IN THAT MORTGAGE ON THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE AVAILABLE LATER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS SPRING- WE FIND THAT WITHOUT% THESE DETAILS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED SPENDING WAY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN A STUDY OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM ABOUT A LACK OF DIVERSITY OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS. AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU PROPOSE FUNDING WHAT LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ARE BEING APPROPRIATE FOR ONE TIME USE A ONE TIME FRIENDS AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH FULL ACTION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND STILL GOT THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SOTHAT YOU. CAN PROP MORE PROPERLY A PATH. THE PROPOSAL. IN ITS ENTIRETY THANK YOU. THANK MISTRANSLATED EIGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO THAT I WITH YOUR- INCLUDE ACTUALLY I FEEL THE SAME WAY MESS UP ABOUT CRAWFORD I HEARD YOU SAY BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING YOUR PUBLIC OUTRAGE. I WILL I WILL SAY THIS- WE HAVE AN INITIATIVE BOTH AND IN THE LATINO CAUCUS CALLED THE UNSEEN AT THE NINE ISSUED OF. LATINOS LATINAS THE LEAD NEXT COMMUNITY IS THE LARGEST COMMUNITY AT THE COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST ADVISE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY OKAY TO SAY THAT THE NON. LET THE NOT LET NEXT AND NOT JUST SIMPLY LUMP IT INTO OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR- WITH THAT SAID HOW WILL THE C. A. C. ENSURE THAT CULTURAL DISTRICTS ARE INCLUSIVE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITY WHAT IS YOUR PUBLIC OUTREACH PLAN. FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH PLAN IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE CORE. WE ARE PLAN FIRST AND FOREMOST TO GATHER AT THE FOURTEEN- MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL COHORT TOGETHER. TO REALLY. SEE IF THEY CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS WHERE. WHAT WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS CURRENTLY WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND SEE GOING FORWARD WHERE THE SUCCESSES. AND THEN DO WHAT WE ARE DOING. WITH CREATE A CORD IT MENTIONED AND HOW REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO COME TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE. HE'S DISTRICTS WHAT'S WHAT SERVICE THEY SEE THESE DISTRICTS ARE SERVING- THIS IS BECOME A VERY. EFFECTIVE WAY OF DEVELOPING THE GUIDELINES FOR THE CREATIVE CORE. WE REALLY HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR FEET BOTH FEET IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY NEED AND BEFORE WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN'T REALLY DO A TOP DOWN ASSESSMENT- WELL THIS COMMUNITY AND EXISTENCE COMMUNITY NEEDS AS INTEL WE ACTUALLY DO INAPPROPRIATE FEEL SCANNED AND LISTEN. CAREFULLY SO I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES L. A. COUNTY BEING THE BIGGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT IS THE OUR TO PLAN FOR L. A. COUNTY. SO L. L. A. COUNTY THE OUTRAGE PLAN WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD HAVE REPRESENTATIVES. FROM THAT COUNTY FROM THAT DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN THAT COUNTY. YEP WHAT COME TO A COMMUNITY PANEL. AND AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT COMMUNITY. TALK ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WHAT THEY THINK THE BENEFIT OF A CULTURAL DISTRICTS WOULD BE IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT WHO ARE YOUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND SPECIFICALLY. OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND WE HAVE STATEWIDE PARTNERS WE HAVE STATE LOCAL PARTNERS IN EVERY COUNTY. SO I'M ASKING SPECIFICALLY FOR L. A. COUNTY WHO ARE YOUR L. A. COUNTY PARTNERS TO DO PUBLIC OUTREACH. FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY BEING THE LARGEST IN THE STATE. AT THIS POINT IN TIME OUR OUR- BEST AND STRONGEST PARTNER THERE IS THE- THAT COUNTY- DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE HEADED UP BY CHRISTMAS THE CODE SHE'S ALSO ONE OF OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNERS FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL. I ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I FEEL WE'VE WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE IN TERMS OF. WHAT IS THE ACTUAL ON THE GROUND APPLICATION FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR LOOK LIKE. WHEN IT'S-ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WHO GETS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES. DO YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEEN FUNDED. AND WHAT THAT OUT REACH ACTUALLY LOOKS UP. YES WE DO HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST AND WHAT THAT OUTRAGE LOOKS LIKE AND HOW WE HOPE TO EXPAND IT. AND I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE THAT DATA TO. BY WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT DATA. I'M NOT TOO SURE- MOST LIKELY WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. OKAY WELL YOU ARE EXPECTING THIS FUNDING PROPOSAL TO MOVE FORWARD CORRECT. YES WE ARE OKAY I AND I AND I SAY THIS IN THE IN THE BEST INTENTION OF I LOVE THE ARTS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TOWARDS. HELPING COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT IS VERY CRITICAL TO ME TO UNDERSTAND. THAT IN THE COUNTIES THAT YOU ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP. YOU HAVE FOLKS ON THE GROUND THAT UNDERSTAND THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THAT OUT REACH EFFORTS. THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THE SAME. YOU KNOW RESOURCES AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BUT THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A PLAN AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTLY. BUT WE WILL GET YOU THAT INFORMATION OF HOW WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT. EXPECT TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE. AND WHAT WILL BE YOUR YOUR DETERMINING FACTOR OR MEASURE OF SUCCESS. OUR MEASURE OF SUCCESS RIGHT. IN IN OUR MINDS WOULD BE THE HEALTH OF THAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CITY. AND CITY GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PARTNERS. AND THE COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS THAT ARE IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF. LITTLE DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW THAT DEMONSTRATE BEST PRACTICES AND SHOW US WHAT THAT IS SO MUCH FILIPINOS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND MARIO LOGAN IN SAN DIEGO. THERE WE HAVE COMMITTED CALLED JUST THAT EACH STEP THESE PRACTICES CURRENTLY AND WE CAN LOOK CAREFULLY AT THOSE WITH. THANK YOU THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'M ASKING LIKE WHAT WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THOSE PROPOSALS AYE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO PROPOSALS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY THE REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE. AND LASTLY I WILL ASK YOU WHAT IS THE C. A. C. DOING TO INSURE THAT UNDERREPRESENTED ARTS COLLECTIVES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM. SO THAT GREATLY AS POSSIBLE WOULD BE MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUTREACH IS EXTENDED THROUGH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE REGIONS THAT WERE TRYING TO. GET INTO AND THEIR WEALTH. REGIONS ARE THE GAPS IN OUR CURRENT COHORT- WELL IDENTIFIED BY THE- REPORT AND THE EVALUATION THAT WE HAVE DONE. AND THAT CAN BE DONE. THROUGH PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER WE HAVE MANY OTHER COMMUNITY ARTS PARTNERS THAT ARE. EMBEDDED INSIDE OF EVERY COUNTY. IF I CAN INTERJECT MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE CULTURAL DISTRICTS IN AN LOS ANGELES LITTLE TOKYO WE WOULD CERTAINLY PARTNER WITH ENTITIES SUCH AS YOU KNOW. POSITIVE RAZA AND LATINO ARTS NETWORK WITH NORTH NETWORK WE WORK WITH FOR DECADES AND DECADES- AND SO- YOU KNOW THESE ARE PARTNERS THAT WE COULD ALWAYS BRING TO THE TABLE- OUR PLAN IS TO HAVE A LISTENING TOUR AND THIS IS HOW WE STARTED IN THE PAST- IT IT'S ABOUT REALLY KIND OF OPENING THE DOOR OR AND BRING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE AND SO. WE UNDERSTAND- WHERE THEY NEED IT UP RIGHT IF THAT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IT TAKES TIME FOR US TO GET INTO THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO CABLE LIKE WE SAID- AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT- WE ALSO WILL BE YOU KNOW REACHING OUT TO BUSINESSES AS WELL BECAUSE- WE HAVE TO START WITH EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. SITUATIONS THAT INVOLVE GENTRIFICATION- WE HAD A GREAT EXAMPLES OF BEST PRACTICES BUDGET BARTLE- AND SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHT. THOSE PRACTICES. AND ONE OTHER THING IF I COULD HAVE MET OF CHAIRS. PLAY ON I JUMP IN AND DO SHARE THAT. IT IS IT'S TIME. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK REALLY REST WITH ALL THIS. BY THE WAY I'M ON THE KEYBOARD AND DEPUTY TO STACY PART OF WHAT WE'VE DONE ALREADY THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN. COMPLICIT IF PUTTING TOGETHER A RESPECTIVE REQUIRE SO WE A QUITE RACE EFFORT ACT RIGHT HERE WHERE THEY WHERE APPLE MY DEMONSTRATE NOT NOT YEAH. THEY HAVE PARTNERSHIPS BUT HOW THE PARTNERS HAVE A RACIAL IT'S LAND HOW THEY'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. COMMUNITIES EITHER THEY ARE OF THE- WHERE THE THAT THEY SERVE THEY HAVE TO. HOW THEY DO THAT AND THEY TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THEIR IN COURT. A RACE EQUITY IN THE- FOR FOUND. WE WILL KEEP THAT MY- THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE GREAT. ONE OF OUR MANAGERS FOR. I WANTED CRITERIA WITH. FOR ALL OF THE APPLE. AND I THINK THE OTHER. TO READ TO MAKING SURE THERE'S- ACCESSIBILITY WE ALSO HAVE AN ACCESSIBILITY CRITERIA. THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS- ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES. IT'S ABOUT WHAT MODEL. HAVE YOU USE TO INCORPORATE MARKETING. WHAT ARE YOU USING TO GET- THE DIFFERENT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES THAT VARIOUS DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE COMMUNITIES. AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OFTEN. USE THE SAME MODES OF GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT AND YOU GET THE THING PEOPLE ALWAYS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE BALL THAT HAVE THE ACCESS. THAT HAVE THE BROADBAND THAT HAVE THE ACCESS TO. THE EMAIL THAT WAS SENT OUT AND SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN SO WE HAVE THOSE TWO CRITERIA. STANDARD GRANT PROGRAMS AND IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THIS ONE AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THE CULTURAL DISTRICT. WE HEY EXPANDING. WE WANT TO KNOW HOW ENGAGING WANT TO KNOW. THAT ACTUALLY A WAY THAT THEY ARE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMMUTE. WE WOULD FIRST BE LOOKING FOR VALUE- THAT WOULD AND RECOMMENDED. FROM INDIVIDUALS AND VARIOUS AREAS. OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WITH THAT ON OUR COMMUNITY PANEL AND WE WOULD HAVE OPENED FORMA DISCUSSION OF WHAT ARE THE ISSUES. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A CUT THE IDEA OF THE PUBLIC DISTRICT THAT'S ONE THING BUT HOW IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN. IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY AS A MATTER SO WE WANT. TO KNOW THAT FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I WOULD ADD. TO OTHER CREDIT. THE ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS IS THAT PARTNERSHIP REALLY FUNCTIONING. WHEN WE ORIGINALLY ROLLED OUT THE PILOT OF THE CULTURAL DISTRICT WE DIDN'T JUST DO AN APPLICATION WE DID AND LETTER OF INTENT. THEY DID AN APPLICATION AND THEN WE DID A SITE VISIT. AND WILL BE WITH THE OTHER FACTOR THAT WE FOUND OUT THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE INDICATED IN THE APPLICATION ONE. IMPLEMENTED IN REAL RELATIONSHIP AND SO IN THIS CASE IF WE DO THE SAME THING. THAT THEY DO THE APPLICATION THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE. AND SHOW LETTERS OF. PARTNERSHIP BUT ALSO THAT WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE AND PROVE THAT. THROUGH WITH. THE CROSS. I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT IN THE- BUT WE WOULD ALSO INCLUDE IN OUR- OUT OF THIS. I WANT. TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIP AND I DO WANT TO GET ONE MORE CHECK BACK APPLE TO. ONE OTHER THING WHEN WE FIRST ROLLED OUT THE PA. WE DO NOT HAVE GOOD. ACROSS THE STATE. THERE WERE- THERE WERE SOME. GROUP THAT WERE NOT RIGHT. IN OUR TOOK A- AND I REGIONAL. AND WE HAD BACK. AND ROLLED OUT A- OP. FOR THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD MORE DIVERSITY AND I CAN'T JUST FOR THE FOURTEEN THAT'S A VERY SMALL GROUP BUT WE USED OUR OWN. THEIR OWN OPERATING MONEY TO DO IT. YES TO HAVE DESIGNATED FUD CONTROVERSY FOR THE FIRST PILOT. AND WE WILL DEFINITELY TAPPED. THEM TO HELP US DEVELOP THE GUIDELINES FOR THE NEXT. FOR THE NEXT AS AN EXPANSION. THANK AND ALSO AND IT. IN TERMS OF THE- YOU WITH INFORMATION- WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT. WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ON. HOW WE ROLL THIS OUT THE LAST TIME- AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REACHED OUT TO YOU. ON THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IS THE IDEA OF HAVING. THESE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IS ON THE LAST ROUND. THERE WERE DISTRICTS THAT JUST WERE QUITE READY YET. AND MAYBE GET THAT SUPPORT. AND MOST OF THOSE WERE FOLKS THAT WERE IN THESE. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD ANY SUPPORT THERE'D CERTAINLY UNDERREPRESENTED. AND SO THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS WILL BE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU AND YOU ARE MISS KRISTEN MARGOLICK. THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARTS COUNCIL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WANNA THANK YOU MISS CAN BURY FOR THE VERY DETAILED EXPLANATION AS TO THE PLANNING PROCESS REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT VERY DISTINCT LANDS- IN THIS CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A VERY DIRECT PLAN. FOR A PUBLIC OUTREACH THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FUTURE CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND THE CONVERSATION ON INCLUSIVITY AND EQUITY NEEDS TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION ONE LAST FINAL QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BE SUPPORTED THE LEGISLATION CAN BE SUPPORTIVE. THE C. A. C. CURRENTLY HAS TWENTY THREE AUTHORIZED POSITION POSITIONS DOES THE COUNCIL HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER SUCH A SIZEABLE PROGRAMMING PLAN. SO WE DO HAVE WE HAVE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS THAT SUPPORT. OUR CURRENT- BASED FUNDING. AND WE WOULD. I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT. THIS LARGE EXPANSION OF THE COVERT. AND IF I COULD GET IF I COULD JUST VERIFY WE ARE TINY AGENCY BUT WE HAVE BIG DURING THAT WE DO BIG WERE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE I'M SORRY ALL OF THE- POSITIONS ALREADY THAT WE HAVE WE ARE LOOKING. AND HOPING FOR SUPPORT TO TAKE SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO ALLOCATE FOR LIMITED TERM POSITION WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO TAKE ON AND DO THE REGULAR WORK AND MEET THE GOALS OF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMMING SO WE ARE LOOKING. TO SEE WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT CAN BE NEGOTIATED TO I'M SUPPORT LIMITED TURN. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT SIX. WHAT I. WAS HOPING TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME CLARITY ON BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS. AN INCREDIBLE AND- POTENTIALLY LIFE CHANGING OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE ARTS INTO RESOURCES. I KNOW MINE IS ONE OF THEM. LOS ANGELES USED TO BE THE MURAL CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. A LOT OF OUR MURALS IN MY COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WHITEWASHED DUE TO GENTRIFICATION. SO I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND WHICH IS WHY I'M ASKING. SUCH DETAILED INFORMATION AS TO THE PLANNING OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE SO THE COMMUNITIES DON'T LOSE- THE HISTORICAL ASPECT OF WHAT MAKES A COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY SO I. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOU FOR THE DETAILED. INFORMATION IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- ISSUE.

ALL RIGHT. THOUGH- YEAH. OKAY I'M FIRST OF ALL FOR THE- CHIEF JUSTICE REVIEW- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MARKET WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT BRINGS BROADBAND SERVICE FROM THE CORE NETWORK OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB TO COMMUNITIES THAT WERE LAST MILE PROVIDERS A TAKES SERVICE TO HOUSEHOLDS- BUSINESSES ANY CURRENT SITUATIONS THE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE ARE IN AND THE IDEAS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS THAT IT WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP BY CONSTRUCTING THE SEGMENTS THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN BUILT BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR MADE AVAILABLE- AT AFFORDABLE RATES. THE BROADBAND FOR ALL EFFORT IT'S INCLUDED MULTIPLE EFFORTS- THE WORK- THE WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA BROADBAND COUNCIL THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE BROADBAND ACTION PLAN UP ALL THAT TO THE BROADBAND INITIATIVE PROVIDED FOR IN SB. ONE FIFTY SIX WAS SIGNED THIS LAST JULY- ISN'T AS- NOTED WE HAD CHEN DOT. SB ONE FIFTY SIX PROVIDE SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE A SPECIFICALLY IT- PROVIDES- C. T. WITH THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE- MIDDLE GROUND THAT WORK AND- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WITH A TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR. LAST MILE EFFORTS THAT THEY'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE- IN UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SB ONE FIFTY SIX A SCIENCE- NUMBER ROLES TEST PACIFIC ENTITIES THAT FIND CITY TEAM AT THE PAST- OF- OVERALL PROGRAM- OVERSIGHT PC'S TASKED WITH THE- PROVIDING MAPPING DATA FOR- FOR THE UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AT A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- GOLDEN STATE NET IS THE A SIDE OF IT IS- SANITY OF MANAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING LEASES WERE NECESSARY. I CALTRANS IS- WHAT WILL BE DOING A MAJOR OF- COULD. OF THE PROCESS ALONG THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN FINANCE TOGETHER READ AND- TRACKING AND REPORTING- THAT EXPENDITURE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS- ON BEHALF OF THE STATE- AS WELL AS THAT OUTCOMES. WE ARE IN TERMS OF THAT COULD THAT THE PROCESS OF THE WAY THAT THE PROD THE PROJECT AS WELL BUT IT'S UNFOLDING OF PC'S ARE PUBLIC PROCEEDING WAS HELD IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER- IT IS THE MAP OF THE UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ALONG THE STATE AND A LOT AS WELL AS THE STATE HAVE ASSISTANCE TO CONNECT THEM IN DECEMBER- WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE DESIGN ENGINEERING STAGE AS THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS BEING DESIGNED. AS THE REMAINING NETWORK SEGMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED C. T. WILL DIRECT CALTRANS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH RECONSTRUCTION. A TO SIGN CONTRACTS BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THEN WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE SYSTEM BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THE SATISFIED REFLECTS THE FACT THAT BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE COST FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE FOR CONSTRUCTION. OF THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPENDITURES OF THESE FUNDS WILL OCCUR IN THE OUT YEARS BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY SIX PRIMARILY A FALLING CALTRANS COMPLETION OF PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK. AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE MODEL IS BEING BUILT USING ALL FEDERAL FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AMERICAN. A PLAN AFTER ABOUT- THESE FUNDS MUST BE UNDER A CONTRACT BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THE PROJECT COMPLETED BY. DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SIX. ARE THESE PHONES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY- THREE QUARTERS OF THE- ROUGHLY EIGHT THOUSAND MILE SYSTEM. WITH A LEASES BEING NOT USED AT THE CLOSE THE GAP- NOVEMBER US HE CANNOT EACH FINANCIAL PROJECTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO- TEACH US ABOUT BUILDING AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE LOCATIONS- THAT WILL SERVE URBAN RURAL AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A BUILDER PERTINENTES COBLE DR TUNING KEYS AND- LEASE OPPORTUNITY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SINCE THE ONE THIRTY SIX WAS SIGNED IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING MEDIA THE MIDDLE MILE ADVICE YOU'RE CONNECTED RIGHT THROUGH TO ME WHICH MEETS ON A MONTHLY BASIS- AND SONIC REMOTES WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CALTRANS AND GOLDEN STATE NET AS THE STATE'S. THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR CDT IS ESTABLISHED A WEBSITE TO PROVIDE UPDATES TO THE PUBLIC AND IS POSTED PC'S WRAPS UP UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AT THIS ADDRESS. AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY HAD REVISED ITS MAPS OF THE HIGHWAYS THAT CONNECT UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. CITY IS CURRENTLY- WORKING WITH THE- STATE NOT TO IDENTIFY THE BEST ROUTES TO CONNECT THESE COMMUNITIES. ARE TO THE CORE OUR FIRST MILE. AND AND CALTRANS WILL. BUILD THE MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEM ALONG THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEMS. BACKGROUND THE CALTRANS ROLES NOTED CALTRANS WILL CONSTRUCT MAJORITY THE SYSTEM- ADDING TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AS WELL AS YOUR STAND ALONE PROJECTS ALONG ITS- THE STATE HIGHWAY RIGHT OF WAY. THIS PART OF THE SENATE DID ONCE EFFORTS CALTRANS CURLY- EXPLORING A SKETCH SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WHICH FIBER CAN BE ADDED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WITHIN THE IN THE FEDERAL ENCUMBRANCE THAT LINE. THESE THESE WANTS OPPORTUNITY- OPINION ARE AT ITS BORDER- RANGE FROM EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT PROPERTY AS MUCH AS SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF THE OVERALL NETWORK. CALTRANS IS CURRENTLY IDENTIFYING THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS FOR THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS THOSE WITH THE GREATEST- INTERACTION WITH OTHER UTILITIES TO GET STARTED ON THE SIDE OF. THE MOST CHALLENGING AREAS THAT'S ALSO WORKING WITH PERMITTING AGENCIES TO STREAMLINE ITS PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S- SB FORTY SIX- PROVIDES FOR PROJECT DELIVERY TOOL SUCH AS DESIGN BUILDING JOB ORDER CONTRACTING. DISSIPATED TO FURTHER HELP CALTRANS COMPLETE PROJECTS- BY THE FEDERAL DEADLINE. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE BUT IT'S NOT COMING FORWARD HERE WE HAVE A C. T. IS THAT- IS MOVING FORWARD TO PROCURE A- PARKING THREE THOUSAND MILES OF FIBER RELATED MATERIALS TO GET AHEADOF ANY SUPPLY CHAIN RESTRAINTS ARE CHAINED CONSTRAINTS AND RISKS- THE FIRST THAT. LEGISLATIVE WILL NOT STAND REPORT BE RELEASED SHORTLY. PROBABLY EXPECTED TO IDENTIFY THE BROADER STATEWIDE NETWORK ASSOCIATED PROJECTS LATER THIS SPRING. ADDITIONAL SYSTEM DESIGN IS EXPECTED BY JULY AND- FIBERS BEING ADDED TO EXISTING TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY. VETERANS WILL BE STARTING UP PRE CONSTRUCTION ON A BROADER SYSTEM BY THIS JULY AS FOR MANY PROJECTS ARE ANNOUNCED AND LEASE AGREEMENTS WILL FOLLOW AS- A DUPLICATION ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IDENTIFIED. WITH THAT- BUT LIKE I THINK MANY BRIDGE TIME AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO ROB OSBORNE THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THAT IF YOU SEE. YOUR DOCTOR THE PUC'S ROLE IN THE BROADBAND INITIATIVE. THANK YOU MARK MY NAME IS ROBERT OSBORNE I'M DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. BUT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX THE CDC HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING ON COMPLETING THE MIDDLE MILE ANALYSIS OPTIMAL TENUOUSLY IMPLEMENTING THE LAST MILE GRANT PROGRAMS. THE FLIGHT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE CPC'S BROADBAND RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING OUR NEW RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER SB ONE FIFTY SIX AND AB ONE SIXTY FOUR. ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE THE BLUE BOX WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE TTC'S MIDDLE MILE RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER SB ONE FIFTY SIX WHICH INCLUDES IDENTIFYING ROUTE. PARTY AREAS. THANK PUBLIC COMMENT ON PROPOSED ROADS AND REPORTING THIS ANALYSIS TO DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. THE GREEN BOX IN THE CENTER- HIGHLIGHTS THE PC'S RESPONSIBILITIES IN IMPLEMENTING THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR LAST MILE FUNDING THE CDC WILL SOON RELEASE A PROPOSED DECISION BUT THE FINAL PROGRAM SENATE PROGRAM RULES. AND FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. ON THE RIGHT OF THE ORANGE BY WHICH THE OTHERS BROADBAND PROGRAMS THIS INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND THE CALIFORNIA THAT SERVICES FUND AND OTHER UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE CPC LIKE LIFELINE AND CALIFORNIA TELEKINETIC FUND AMONG THE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THIS WORK MIDDLE MILE LOCATIONS DESPITE PROVIDES A TIMELINE OF THE CPC'S ACTIONS ON THE MIDDLE MILE BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER LAST YEAR WE FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS THROUGH THE BROADBAND PRECEDING. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX GIVE US NINETY DAYS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. IN DECEMBER IN JANUARY OF THE CPC IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY RELEASED ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS MAPS AND DATA INCLUDING THE PUBLIC COMMENT MAP. LOCATIONS WITHOUT BROADBAND ACCESS AT TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWN AND THREE MEGABITS PER SECOND UP. AND CALTRANS SCHEDULED PROJECT MAPS REMAINING ANALYSIS AND COORDINATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ANTICIPATE ITS POLICE SHORTLY. THANKS BYE. THE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED FOR ELIGIBLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO FACILITATE DEPLOYMENT OF LAST MILE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THE FLY PROVIDE THE TIMELINE OF THE CQC'S DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THANK YOU SEE SPENT SEPTEMBER THROUGH JANUARY REALLY THINKS THAT PROPOSALS AND SOLICITING STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK. THE CDC FORMALLY ADOPTED PROGRAM ROLES AT THE FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH VOTING MEETING LAST WEEK AND WE PLAN TO BEGIN ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS AROUND MAY OF THIS YEAR. EXPIRED PLATES. ON THE LAST MILE INITIATIVE A LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ALSO ALLOCATED TWO BILLION AND FEDERAL ART THE FUNDS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY CONNECT UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO LAST MILE BROADBAND SERVICE THROUGH THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT. THE CPC HAS RELEASED SEVERAL RULINGS SOLICITING PUBLIC FEEDBACK ON PROPOSED LAST MILE FUNDING. A FINAL PROPOSAL WILL BE RELEASED VERY SHORTLY AND THE CBC EXPECTS TO OPEN APPLICATION CYCLES AROUND JULY THIS YEAR. AND APPROVING APPLICATION THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR. CURRENTLY THE U. S. TREASURY HAS BEEN RELEASING GUIDANCE AND RULES FOR SPENDING THESE FUNDS. APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION THE LAST MILE I THINK COMES FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT ARPA. NOT SPEAK RECAP FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS AND A FURTHER FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION COMES FROM THE ARPA CAPITAL PROJECTS FUND. U. S. TREASURY RELEASED THE FINAL RULE FOR OUR FOR STATE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS ON JANUARY SIX AND THE RULES ARE PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER ON JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH. CALIFORNIA FIVE PRE CAPITAL PROJECTS FUNDS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS FUND IN DECEMBER AND TREASURY NOTIFY CALIFORNIA B. WARD IN JANUARY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ALSO CREATED A NEW STATE- FUNDED LOAN LOSS RESERVE TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND APPLYING PUBLIC NETWORKS WITH THE GOAL OF EXPANDING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SECURE FINANCING THE BILL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. CPC HAS SOLICITING FEEDBACK AND FORMALLY FROM STAKEHOLDERS WE ANTICIPATE RELEASING A STAFF PROPOSAL IN QUARTER THREE OF THIS YEAR IN ADOPTING PROGRAM ROLES IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME DID POINT OUT THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE MONEY COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND NOT THE FEDERAL FUNDS SO IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO DISTRICTS FAT FEDERAL ENCUMBRANCE DEADLINES. LAST NIGHT PLEASE. THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND SO THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE BROADBAND FUNDING ALLOCATED TO A SOME LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AB FOURTEEN AND THAT'S BEFORE EXTENDED FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA MAP SERVICES FUND INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC HOUSING ADOPTION CONSORTIA COUNTS. IN DECEMBER THE CPC ACTED ON ALL OUTSTANDING CASF INFRASTRUCTURE APPLICATIONS. IN A SEPARATE AND DURING THIS MONTH THE CPC OF TARGETING- TO MAIL A RULING WITH PROPOSED PROGRAM RULES FOR THE CONSORTIA THE ADOPTION AND THE PUBLIC HOUSING SUB ACCOUNTS AS WELL AS PROPOSED FUNDING FOR FUNDING ALLOCATIONS FOR EACH ACCOUNT IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THE TPC OF TARGETING OPENING APPLICATION CYCLES IN JULY OF THIS YEAR FOR THOSE SUB ACCOUNTS ON ALLOCATION- BASED ON THE APPROPRIATIONS THE ALLOCATION I MENTIONED EARLIER- BASED ON THE PROPOSED STATE BUDGET. THE CDC WILL CONSIDER SURCHARGE. WHERE HAVE AN OPEN PROCEEDING ON THAT RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT A BUDGET INCREASE IN THE OUT YEARS. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION CAN WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON DEEMING THEM NOT A PROPER FINANCE I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO THIS PRESENTATION BUT I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. LOL. BRIAN METZGER L. A. O. THE AGENDA AND PRESENTATION DO A GOOD JOB SUMMARIZING THE ADMINISTRATIONS AND LEGISLATURES BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT- JUST FOR REFERENCE OUR OFFICE RECENTLY PREPARE TO HAND OUT WITH SOME DETAILED BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE FOR A RECENT ASSEMBLY COMMUNICATIONS AND CAMPAIGNS COMMITTEE HEARING AND WILL PREPARE ANOTHER HAND OUT FOR AN UPCOMING HEARING IN THE SAME COMMITTEE ON LAST MILE PROJECTS AND- WITH THAT WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO AT THAT PARTICULAR COMMITTEE WILL IT HAVE- MORE INFORMATION ON SHOVEL READY PROJECTS BOTH FOR MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE. BUT YEAH AGAIN MARK ONE ROW WITH CDT- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT QUESTION WAS WAS TARGETED TOWARD OR SOMETHING THAT THAT THE L. A. L. BUT- CALTRANS IS IN THE PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW ALL POINT- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO THAT METABOLIC BY THREE COMMITTEES US. AS WE GET UPDATED INFORMATION- IN THE MONTHS TO COME FROM CALTRANS REGARDING- YOU KNOW WHAT WHICH SHOVEL READY PROJECTS- IT'S GOING TO BE ADDED TO- WE WILL BE PROVIDING UPDATES ARE. MISERABLE YOU BE PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO SPECIFIC ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE WHOSE DISTRICTS ARE IMPACTED BY. MIDDLE MILE. AND LAST MILE OF PROJECTS. YEAH BUT WHEN WE WHEN WE WILL BE PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION. ARE WE HAVE A STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH PROCESS- THAT THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED- AND THAT SO AS AS THE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE- WE WANT TO BE OUT I WAS PRESENTING YOU KNOW IT THAT ANY ANY UPDATES AFTER A MILD HIGHS YOUR COMMITTEE- AND TO THE EXTENT I CAN LOOK AT HER WELL ONCE MONTHLY BUT TO THE EXTENT EXTENT WE KNOW BEFOREHAND WE WOULD- ALSO. A PLAN AND REACHING OUT. OKAY I SURE THAT BECAUSE- BROADBAND. CLEARLY IS A PRIORITY TO ALL MEMBERS IN THE LEGISLATURE BOTH AND RURAL. AND URBAN AREAS GIVEN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF CODED. WE HAVE SEEN- REALLY HOWL. LACK OF AXIS HAS IMPACTED STUDENTS. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS ONLY GROWING BIGGER. AND SO WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE INNER CITY LIKE ME AND STILL HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS LINE. AND NOT HAVING ACCESS TO BROADBAND OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR ANY OTHER AREA. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NEED IS REALLY ABOUT EQUITY. AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT. ACCESS TO BROADBAND GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. THIS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF. THE AGENCY AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATORS TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW. HOW THIS IS BEING IMPACTED AND IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR DISTRICTS. SO I HAVE A CONFIRMATION FROM YOU THAT THAT INFORMATION IS BEING PROVIDED. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. YES YES. OKAY. I DON'T DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO OKAY PRETTY MUCH OKAY MY QUESTIONS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS- CDT AND MR MORALE THE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEEN INITIAL MIDDLE WHILE PROJECTS INCLUDE MANY OF THE URBAN IN NATURE OF COURSE BUT ONE OF THE EIGHTEEN THAT IS NUMBER FOURTEEN IS LOCATED IN SAN MARINO COUNTY AND IS INTENDED TO RUN ALONG HIGHWAY TWO FORTY SEVEN FROM HIGH DESERT BARSTOW TO A PLACE CALLED. BORN MY QUESTION MY FIRST QUESTION IS HOW MANY UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. IN THIS AREA. ARE IN THIS AREA AND WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE LAST MILE FACILITIES AS A RESULT OF THIS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK LOCATION. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA. YEAH I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR YOU I KNOW THAT WE TRACK THAT- TO YOUR POINT- YOU KNOW WHEN WE BUILD MIDDLE MILE- YOU KNOW WE REMIND. PEOPLE THAT THAT MIDDLE MILE DOESN'T YOU KNOW THAT GETS THE BROADBAND TO A COMMUNITY- AND SO- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL COMMUNITIES THERE- ON THE ON THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION'S MAPS. THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD IDENTIFY THAT- THE NUMBERS ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALONG THOSE ROUTES THAT WOULD EVENT THAT COULD EVENTUALLY BE SERVED- BUT THEN THERE. THERE'S THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESS FOR THAT NOT EVEN SUBSEQUENT BECAUSE BUT AS FAR NOTABLE MISTRUST BORN THERE ARE A- THAT- SEVENTEEN YEARS PROCESS OF THAT THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GOING THROUGH HER DEFINING THOSE LAST MILE PROJECTS. BUT BUT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER. OF HOUSEHOLDS- WE CAN CIRCLE BACK ON THAT- I KNOW. WE HAVE WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE. BUT BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME. K. MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT I'M GUESSING YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ANSWER TO BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO US. I BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE COST WOULD BE OF DEPLOYING THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. IN THAT LOCATION AND I JUST REFER TO. I'M GUESSING PROBABLY TO. ARE PREPARED FOR THAT ANSWER. RIGHT OKAY- I ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THIS PROJECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE PROJECT DUE TO ITS LOCATION AND THAT DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I CONNECTED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE ACRE INSTITUTIONS BUT IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW MANY PREVIOUSLY UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BECOME CONNECTED RESERVATIONS IN THE DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE QUARTER MAY HAVE. A CENTRAL FFICE CONNECTION BUT MOST INDIVIDUAL HOMES STILL DO NOT HAVE LAST MILE SERVICE. AND MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE PREDICTABLE HOW HOW WOULD YOU ENSURE THAT THE NEW STATE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK INCLUDING THE BAR STARTED TOWARD ROUTE. WELL ACTION RESULT IN LAST MILE CONNECTIONS. TO THESE UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE GOAL. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS- THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS LAST MILE- ACCOUNTS THAT PROJECTS AND THE PUBLIC UTILITY CAN UTILITIES COMMISSIONS PROCESS FOR. ADMINISTERING THOSE GRANTS IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL- WE KNOW THAT- MORE BROADLY- THE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO FUND THE COST- IN A LOT OF CASES OF. BOTH THAT THAT MIDDLE MILE SEGMENT TO GET OUT TO THAT LAST MILE SO- WE KNOW THAT- WHEN SIMILAR MARKETS TODAY ANNOUNCED WHERE I'VE BEEN REALLY CREATES- A AND IT'S MUCH MORE OF AN INCENTIVE- FOR LAST MILE PROVIDERS TO BECOME INVOLVED AND TO WORK. TO BUILD OUT THEIR SERVICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ADDED COST OF BUILDING UP THAT MIDDLE MILE. SO WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE MARKET WILL HELP US ALL FOR THAT AS WELL AS- THE FUNDING BEING PROVIDED BY- THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED SB. ONE FIFTY SIX THROUGH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OKAY I WOULD. I'M ALSO GONNA CISCO BUT I HAVE HERE YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE IS THE PROPOSED NEW BAR STARTED THORN ROUTE INTENDED TO CONNECT WITH DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE. BE AWARE WHETHER THAT'S A REALITY OR NOT- YES I BELIEVE. THERE THERE'S THE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS WHICH WERE DONE PRIMARILY TO LEARN RIGHT I MEAN WE HAD A THEY WERE AREAS WHERE AT THE- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH AND IN THEIR ANALYSIS TO BE ABLE TO BE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS- INDEED THERE THERE WAS A SOLUTION WAS NEEDED AND SO WE MOVED FORWARD WITH THEM- ABSOLUTELY HERE IN. I'VE BEEN IN MONTHS TO COME WILL BE IDENTIFIED OF MORE BROADLY WHAT PRESS THE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET A BETTER IDEA OF- OF CONNECTED BUT IN THE END. WE'RE BUILDING A NETWORK AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED. OKAY I'M GONNA ASK THIS QUESTION TO AND- IT MIGHT BE ENTERED AT A LATER TIME. AS A GROUP WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT A LAST MILE OF. BROADBAND PROVIDER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO CONNECT HOMES ALONG THE- CDT NUMBER FOURTEEN MENTAL WHILE PROJECT. DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A GOAL. WELL YEAH BECAUSE THEY HAVE- LAST MILE- PROJECTS- DETECTED TO SERVE THE LAST MILE NEED. BUT WHY DO WE HAVE ANY TARGET DATE FOR THAT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. I HAVE TO DEFER TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGARDING WHAT- WHAT IS IN THE WORKS THERE- OKAY. STROUDWATER NAPKINS- STILL ON YES I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT THANK YOU MISTER MOROSO- THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT- AS I SAID EARLIER WE EXPECT TO BE RELEASING PROPOSED RULED SHORTLY- BUT GOAL IS TO START- ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR LAST MILE USING THAT ACCOUNT AND BEGINNING IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. OKAY SO. IN CONCLUSION HOW MANY OF THESE MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED INTEREST TO ENTER. TO ENTER CONNECT FOR ONE OR MORE LAST MILE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN WITH ENOUGH HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES LIKELY TO SUBSCRIBE TO THEIR SERVICE. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT IS THE VIABILITY OF THESE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS. WELL IN TERMS OF THE EIGHTEEN THAT THERE ARE. ONE BE CAREFUL WEEK WEEK WE SELECTED THEM IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN- IDENTIFIED AS AS REQUIRING SOLUTION AS PART OF A BROADER NETWORK. THIS IS A NETWORK WE'RE BUILDING AND SO- I THINK IN IN THE IN INITIALLY A AND IDENTIFYING THE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS SOME OF THEM- WERE ANTICIPATED TO. TO TRY TO OUT SOME LAST MILE- SYSTEM MILE SERVICE THAT WOULD BE- ERROR FOR AREAS THAT MOVE A PROJECT THAT HAD BEEN FUNDED. OR WE'RE GOING TO BE FUNDED- BUT REALLY- THAT THE CONNECTIVITY IS GOING TO COME WHEN WE BUILT THE REST AND IT ALL. TIES TOGETHER. AND SO AND THAT'S THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS TO- YOU KNOW TO PROVIDE THAT- THAT FREEWAY IF YOU WELL TO- FOR LAST MILE PROVIDERS TO CONNECT TO. AND I THINK THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CASES IF YOU'RE A- IF YOU'RE A OKAY LAST MILE PROVIDER- AND IF YOU DON'T. HAVE THE FUNDS TO BUILD THE MIDDLE MILE- TO GET TO A COMMUNITY- THEN YOU PROBABLY YOU MAY NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT IF YOU GET WHAT YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY ELSE BUILT IT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE. AND SO- WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW THAT. THERE'S THAT THERE'S A NEED WE KNOW THAT- ELSEWHERE WHEN YOU'VE- MA'AM I'LL- THE MARKET COMES AND ADDRESSES THAT AND WHEN IT COMES TO- AND I THINK- STRASBOURG PROBABLY SPEAK A LITTLE MORE TO THIS AS WELL- IF. IF BOB PROVIDERS ARE LOOKING FOR SAY PASS OUT FUNDING- IF THEY HAVE. A LAST MILE MIDDLE MILE TO CONNECT TO- IT SAYS THAT IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE. SALAS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER LACKING AND GIVEN NO ADDITIONAL GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN THANK YOU AGAIN GENTLEMEN APPRECIATE IT. AFTER THIS ISSUE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE- MISTER CHRIS SMILE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ACTUALLY BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO GO IN TURN THE- MIKE OVER TO JENNIFER URBAN WHO WILL INTRODUCE THE ISSUE INVOLVES YOU DOING THAT'LL GET MY SCREECH OR SET UP GREAT THANK YOU PLEASE BEGIN WITH SERMON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN AND I'M THE CHIEF OF BUDGETS AND ACCOUNTING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAROLE SYSTEM. BY THE CHANGE PROPOSAL. AS YOU REQUESTING INCREASED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE C. S. P. S. PROJECT. WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE. THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL TO THE PROJECT SUCCESS AS A SOLICIT AT THE SOLUTION DESIGN. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION WILL COMMENCE AS THE PROJECT ANTICIPATES. THE SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. HAS IT PRIMARY BUSINESS PARTNER ON THE PROJECT IS REQUESTING RESOURCES TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT. INTO IT HERE TO REQUEST FOR PROJECT RELATED ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE AGREED UPON TIMELINES. THESE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE COUNTY CHARGES SEX SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE H. R. COMPONENTS OF THE ARCH SKILLED STATEWIDE PROJECT. PERSONNEL PROJECT DIRECTOR WILL NOW PROVIDE A STATUS. UPDATE ON THE PROJECT THANK YOU. OKAY YOU JENNIFER I WOULD AGAIN MY NAY IS CHRIS MAYO AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- IS THERE WE GO. IN MY PRESENTATION TODAY I'M GONNA COVER LESSONS LEARNED BY THE PROJECT TOUCH ON INFORMATION GATHERED DURING MARKET RESERCH. DISCUSS THE SCHEDULE AND PROJECT FUNDING NEEDS AND CLOSE WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECTS OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK. DURING OUR PROJECT PLANNING WE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO STUDY WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE PAST EFFORTS BECAUSE LESSONS ARE ONLY LEARNED IF YOU DON'T REPEAT THE MISTAKES FROM THE PAST. SO WE LOOK INSIDE AND EXAMINE PROJECT ARTIFACTS INTERVIEWED STAFF AND SEVERAL PAST PROJECT DIRECTORS AND PROJECT MANAGERS SEEKING THEIR INPUT. WE DIDN'T STOP THERE WE ALSO LOOKED OUTSIDE AND OTHER ENTITIES WHO ALSO FAILED AND THOSE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL. WE TALKED TO OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEW YORK CITY THE STATE OF OREGON COLORADO NEBRASKA AND HAWAII. WILL ALSO HOST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF CANADA FOR A DAY AND A HALF OF CANDID DISCUSSIONS SHARING LESSONS LEARNED FROM EACH OF OUR FAILED PROJECTS. AND WE MET WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S YOU SEE PAST PROJECT TEAM. TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR SUCCESSFUL APPROACH. TO DATE THE PROJECT IS ARGUMENTATIVE OVER SEVENTY DIFFERENT LESSONS LEARNED THAT SPANNED MAJOR CATEGORIES SUCH AS THOSE RAISED BY THE TASK FORCE ON RE ENGINEERING IT PROCUREMENT FOR SUCCESS. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HOW TO RUN A BETTER VIRTUAL REQUIREMENTS VALIDATION SESSION ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT LESSONS AND CONTINUES TO REVIEW ITS WORK AS A PERFORMS AT AND ADJUST AS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR RESEARCH WAS THAT WE MUST HAVE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BEGINNING PROCUREMENT. THIS KEY ELEMENT WAS MISSING FROM PAST EFFORTS. BUT WE DIDN'T START BY READING REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD WE STARTED BY DOCUMENTING OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM END TO END. AND WE CLOSELY EXAMINE THOSE PROCESSES SEEKING WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM. WITH THIS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO NEARLY FORTY DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS WE PUT THE PROJECT DOCUMENTED OUR FUTURE STATE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND THEN WROTE MID LEVEL IN DETAIL REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWED BY EVEN MORE DETAIL BUSINESS RULES. AS WE ALL KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND THE CULMINATION OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS RESULTED IN QUITE AN EXQUISITE SIDE OF REQUIREMENTS. LESSONS LEARNED ALSO INFORMED US THAT REDUCING COMPLEXITY IS KEY TO ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES IN THE REQUIREMENTS WE DEVELOP REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY REDUCTION IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE STATE CONFORMS TO STANDARD PRACTICES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM IS ALSO REDUCED WHICH INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. AND REDUCES ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSE. PAUL ROBUST AND RIGOROUS TESTING OF COURSE WILL OCCUR DURING THE EXECUTION PHASE OF THIS PROJECT WE'RE FOLLOWING THIS PRINCIPAL DURING PROCUREMENT AS WELL. PERSPECTIVE VENDORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SHOW HOW THEIR PRODUCT WILL MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS THROUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT PHASE OF THE PROCUREMENT. WHERE THE STATE WILL PRESENT THE MOST COMPLEX PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SCENARIOS TO THEM AND IT WILL BE PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS. NOW GIVEN THAT WE'RE MOVING TO REPLACE THE NEARLY FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM. WE RECOGNIZED EARLY IN OUR PLANNING THAT THIS IS TRULY A MASSIVE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROJECT. WITH A COMMENSURATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPLEMENT. AS I NOTED EARLIER WE STARTED CHANGE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS THREE YEARS AGO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF. THROUGH EARLY INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF DEFINING OUR FUTURE STATE PROCESSES IN WRITING AND VALIDATING REQUIREMENTS. AFTER THAT WE DIRECTLY ENGAGE WITH THE STATE'S EMPLOYEES BY HAVING THEM BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO ONLINE ACCESS TO PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL DATA. THROUGH THE CATHOLIC LEAGUE CONNECT APPLICATION. WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND REGISTERED USERS TO DATE THE STATE'S EMPLOYEES HAVE SHOWN THEY ARE EAGER TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS PART OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE. BY CONTINUING THESE PRACTICES AND THREE FUTURE ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO YOU PLAN TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO THAT FUTURE SOLUTION. SO IN ADDITION THE CATALOGING AND RESPONDING TO LESSONS LEARNED WE ALSO CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH. SO WHY NOT FISCAL S. C. O. DID IN FACT CONSIDER INTEGRATION WITH THIS COW WAS DID CONSIDER WHETHER INTEGRATION WITH THIS COW WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE WE STARTED WITH A VERY WELL ATTENDED OPEN VENDOR FORUM WHERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THIRTY FOUR CONSULTING FIRMS AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING FIRMS LIKE C. GI ORACLE PEOPLESOFT WORKDAY. THEY WERE ALL PROVIDED WITH AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECTS TO THE PROJECT BY EXECUTIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOLLOWING THE FORUM THE PROJECT IS THE HIGH LEVEL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO SEE WHAT THE MARKET HAD OFFERED. WITHIN HOSTED GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERESTED VENDORS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND WE TOOK ANOTHER STEP DEEPER AND RELEASED A DETAILED REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE CENTER REQUIREMENTS WE HAD WRITTEN TO DATE. THIS GENERATED VERY INFORMATIVE INDIVIDUAL VENDOR DISCUSSIONS WITH SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS AND AGAINST AWESOME THE SOFTWARE SOLUTION PROVIDERS. ALL OF WHOM INDICATED THEY WOULD PROPOSE THAT OUR MOST MODERN PRODUCTS IN RESPONSE TO THE C. S. P. S. PROCUREMENT. IN THE END THE ORACLE PEOPLESOFT PLATFORM ON WHICH THIS CAL OPERATES ASSEMBLY NOT EVEN MENTION BY THE VENDOR COMMUNITY. WITH ALL THIS RESEARCH AND HANDLE PROJECT TEAM RECOMMENDED A CLOUD HOSTED INTEGRATED PLATFORM IS THE SOLUTION FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT KNOW TO BE A COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF SYSTEM. SO NOW ALL THE L. A. O. HAS SUGGESTED THE PROJECT IS EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN THE PROCUREMENT. PROJECTS PLANNING PHASE LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AROUND THE SCHEDULE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT SCHEDULE FROM THE STAGE TO ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS APPROVED BY CDT IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DOCUMENTED THAT JULY OF TWENTY TWO WOULD BE THE POINT IN TIME WHEN WE THINK A CONTRACT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARDED. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CDT STATEWIDE TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT DIVISION IDENTIFIED METHODS OF REDUCING THE TIME THAT IT COULD TAKE TO CONDUCT THE PROCUREMENT. WHILE THE SAME TIME THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES THE PROJECT TO EXECUTE AND ADDITIONAL ANCILLARY CONTRACT. FOR ENTERPRISE ARCHITECT TO REEVALUATE THE APPROACH IDENTIFIED THROUGH MARKET RESEARCH TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH THAT ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF INSURANCE. THAT THAT NEW THE APPROACHES SOUND. WELL THIS DIDN'T JACK SEVERAL MONTHS OF TIME TO THE PLANNING PHASE WE'RE NOW TRACKING ON EXECUTING A CONTRACT IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE WANT TO COUNTER CHALLENGES DURING PROCUREMENT. BUT THE PROJECT'S RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE EMPLOYED. TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS AND OF THE PROJECT GOVERNING BODY WILL BE AT THE READY TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER. I AM VERY PLEASED TODAY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE PROJECT DID SUBMIT THE STAGE THREE SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE TO CDT ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH. WHICH MARKS THE CULMINATION OF A MASSIVE EFFORT BY THE PROJECT TEAM TO CREATE A SOLICITATION OF THIS MAGNITUDE. AS A RESULT THE PROJECT IS NOW TRACKING ON THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. AND THE SUBSEQUENT RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION BY THE END OF MARCH TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT EXECUTION PHASE WHERE THE PROJECT WILL INCUR THE EXPENSES. OF THE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION VENDOR AND ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE SOLUTION COSTS. IF THE PROJECT MAINTAINS THE CURRENT SCHEDULE MR MILE I'M GOING TO PLEASE ASK IF YOU CAN. TRY TO WRAP UP YOUR REMARKS. OKAY ANALYSTS SEE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HEAR THESE THIS PIECE HERE- SO THE OVERSIGHT FOR THIS PROJECT. WE ARE IN THE FOLLOWING CITIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE TO THE TV AND RUBIO MANAGING THE PROJECT WITH THE RIGOR NEEDED FOR A PROJECT OF THIS SIZE. AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE STEERING COMMITTEE- WHOSE MEMBERS ARE CAL HR AND SCO THOSE THE TWO PROJECT PARTNERS ON THIS PROJECT ROUNDING THAT OUT I HAVE THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CDT. THE PROJECT LEADERSHIP TEAM IS MANAGED BY CALYX R&amp;S CO. THE PROJECT REPORTING WE ACTUALLY REPORT TO CDC ON A BI WEEKLY BASIS WE ALSO HAVE WEEKLY REPORTING WITHIN THE PROJECT TEAM ITSELF IN ON A BI MONTHLY BASIS WE REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE. AND AGAIN QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND OF COURSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT'S THROUGH ALL OF THAT OVERSIGHT THAT- YOU WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. REALLY WEIGH IN ON THIS PROJECT BEFORE IT'S FINALLY APPROVED- IN MOVING ON YOU KNOW TO ITS EXECUTION PHASE. LASTLY THE PROJECT PER PUBLISHES THREE EXECUTIVE LEVEL REPORTS THAT COVER THE SCHEDULE. THE PERFORMANCE THE TIES TO THAT SCHEDULE THAT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR WHEN THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OCCURRING AND FINALLY A RISK AND IF YOU REPORT THAT SHOWS ANY ACTIVE ISSUES OF THE PROJECT IS TRACKING ON. IN IN THE NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM RISKS AND WITH ADEQUATE AND WRAP UP. THANK YOU AS MY MUCH APPRECIATED LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. THE ED DOMINIC ADAIR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROJECT AND THE REQUEST AS PROPOSED WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS BEFORE IT FINAL VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU LEN. INVESTOR L. A. O. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PLANNING DOLLARS AND POSITIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT DEFERRED CONSIDERATION OF THE REMAINING EIGHTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN FUNDING FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR RACE THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH APPROVING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS AT THIS TIME. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INFORMATION NOW TO APPROVE THESE FUNDS KEY PIECES OF INFORMATION ARE NOT AVAILABLE LOOKING UP FINAL BASELINE COSTS SCHEDULE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT SIGN VENDOR CONTRACTS AND OTHER SUPPORTING PROJECT DOCUMENTATION. SECOND THE PROJECTS ASSUME TIMELINE TO COMPLETE PLANNING IS OPTIMISTIC IT COULD EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL DELAYS FROM ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES PROCUREMENT AND OTHER RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AGREEMENTS FROM BARGAINING UNITS. ALSO AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROJECT INTEGRATES WITH PASCAL INCLUDING AT A MINIMUM HOW THE TWO SYSTEMS WILL INTERFACE WITH ONE ANOTHER IF THE. C. S. P. S. PROJECT IS APPROVED. THIRD THE PRICE PROPOSE SCHEDULE PROVIDE THE ADMINISTRATION WITH FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE PROJECTS BUT AT THE COST OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. POSTSEASON YES I T. PROJECT IF APPROVED WOULD BE ONE OF THE COSTLIEST AND MOST COMPLEX IT PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE STATE'S.

THE SHIFT WOULD ABOUT ALLOW US TO- PAPER TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE OF OUR- ABOUT OF CITIES OVER STAFF- THROUGH GENERAL FUND IS TO OF COST RECOVERY IT WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE OVERHEAD POSITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN TSR APP AS WELL AS SOME OF THE- INDIRECT POSITIONS AS WELL C. A. T. T. LOOKS AT DIRECT INDIRECT AND OVERHEAD COSTS THIS LIST TO COVER THE OVERHEAD. COMPONENT AND THE INTER COMPONENT- IT WOULD I WANT TO POINT OUT IT- YOU WE WOULD STILL.

OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CITY'S BUSINESS MODEL FOR PROVIDING IT SERVICES. THESE PROPOSALS NOT ONLY SEEK TO ADDRESS REVENUE LOSSES BUT A DECLINING CUSTOMER BASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT STATE DATA CENTER. ONE REASON APPEARS TO BE SOME STATE DATA CENTER RATES ARE NOT COMPETITIVELY PRICED. ANOTHER REASON IS DIRECT RATE COMPARISON BETWEEN PRIVATE VENDORS AND THE STATE DATA CENTER. INCLUDING BENEFITS SPECIFIC TO STATE SERVICES. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR STATE ENTITIES TO UNDERTAKE. WELL PROPOSAL THAT PRESENTED THE LARGEST ALSO ARE MISSING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANTICIPATED RATE REEVALUATION PROCESS THAT IS EXPECTED TO. ADDITIONAL REVENUE LOSSES AND MAKES THE DATA CENTER RATES MORE COMPETITIVE. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROCESS OF COURSE SERVICES PROVIDED TO STATE ENTITIES AND THE ANTICIPATED SHIP THE FUNDING FOR SOME I. T. SERVICES TO THE GENERAL FUND. SUGGEST A MORE ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS. THEREFORE WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT DIRECTS CDC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFINE THE RATE THE EVALUATION PROCESS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT INCLUDING THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE AGENDA. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

OUR SECOND PROPOSAL IS THE BC PEOPLE FOR POSITIONS RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE AND TRANSFORMATION CENTER THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED WITHIN OUR AGENCY. THE GOAL OF. WHAT WE CALL THE GET CENTER IS TO ACCELERATE THE MODERNIZATION OF STATE OPERATIONS. BY PARTNERING WITH STATE DEPARTMENTS CONDUCT INNOVATIVE PILOTS THAT CAN BE SCALED ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT.

CLASSIFICATION STATUS THAT'S WHAT HE'S FOR WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY WITHIN OUR AGENCY THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT EXCLUDED PURPOSE.

FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IN OUR CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER STATUTE LAST YEAR WE RECEIVED APPROVAL TO ESTABLISH A CHEAP BACKWARDS EQUITY OFFICER TO SPEAK ON IMPORT. AND WE ARE BRINGING FORTH. I TRAILER BILL TO FORMALLY ESTABLISH THAT STATUTE AS WELL AS- PROVIDE SOME DEFINITIONS SURROUNDING ITS ROLE- WITH THAT. WITH ME CUSTOMER DROWNED AT THAT THE SECRETARY FOR INNOVATION ACCOUNTABILITY ENJOYED BONTA BURKE ARE STATES DATA OFFICER ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS ON OUR- THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. RIGHT RIGHT BUT FINANCE IT NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME AND ARE HAPPY INC YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I DO WANNA DRAW SOMETHING REALLY TO THE CENTER FOR- AT. WHICH SEEMS LIKE A WONDERFUL IDEA AS WELL AS THE- POSITION FOR- SOMEONE RELATED TO ISSUES RELATED TO EQUITY- I WILL SAY THIS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE- GAPS IN THOSE THAT HAVE ACCESS AND THOSE THAT DON'T- FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WON THE STATE ROLLED OUT COOL THE TESTING. OUT ONE OF THE LARGER FACILITIES WAS AT DODGER STADIUM IN MY COMMUNITY AND WHAT WE NOTICED WAS THAT UNLESS YOU HAD A CAR AND YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT SEVERAL HOURS TO RECEIVE TESTING AND THEN WHEN TESTING FOLLOWED AND THEN WE HAD BACK SCENES. YOU NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS AND YOU NEEDED TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SMARTPHONE TO EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE. THE APPOINTMENT- CLEARLY THAT DID NOT RESULT IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES RECEIVING ACCESS BECAUSE MOST OF HOME. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO TAKE THE BUS. OR IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SMARTPHONE. THEY DIDN'T HAVEACCESS TO ACTUALLY EVEN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. IF THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH THEY WERE CERTAINLY CUT OFF BECAUSE OF LACK OF LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A CENTER FOR GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THIS. FIRST FACILITY. WAS IN MY DISTRICTBUT IT WAS NOT FOR MY DISTRICT AND SO I THINK. I WANT TO POINT OUT HOW WILL THE CENTER ACTUALLY CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH GOVERNMENT TREATS CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND MORE EQUITABLE WAY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- I'M SURE AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT IN IN THE SHAPE OF A PILOT- WHERE WE COULD SEE WHERE. LOOKING AT PROBLEMS IN PLACE TO OUR- CREATE GREATER ACCESS AND TO CREATE ACCESS ON A- MORE REGULAR AND CONSISTENT BASIS I MEAN WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT- REACHING OUT TO HARD TO FIND COMMUNITIES THROUGH OUR SENSES WORK- AS WELL THROUGH. THE VACCINATION WORK THAT ARE- SECRETARY LED TO- AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCY BROADBAND. OF BENEFIT BUT- THE CENTER WOULD UP TO TAKE THOSE LESSONS. AND TO PUT THEM IN A WAY THAT COULD BE MORE EASILY SHARED ACROSS GOVERNMENT THROUGH- A CASE STUDY OR A BEST PRACTICES DOCUMENT. BUT PART OF THE POWER OF HAVING THE PARTICULARLY IN IN THE AGENCY LEVEL. IS TO- THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE AND CONVENE. AND THAT THAT'S WHERE WE CAN GET PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE. AS WELL AS PEOPLE FROM WITHIN THE STATE TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND COME UP. WITH A- THE STRATEGY PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE KEY PIECES OF THE GET CENTER IS THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE CONTROL AGENCIES- AND TO GET THEM TO COORDINATE. AND ALIGN THEIR THEIR- THEIR PRIORITIES AND THIS IS A WAY WE COULD BUILD- INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS. AND GUIDANCE- CHU CHU TAKE A BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE- YOU KNOW. BUT ABILITY TO DO THIS KIND ABOUT REGION CERTAIN PEOPLE WITH I MEAN THIS IS- THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A WITH WITH- THE WHOLE BROADBAND ISSUE WHICH WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO REACH INTO COMMUNITIES- AND DIFFERENT HAVE DIGITAL SERVICES AND ASK PEOPLE TO USE- YOU KNOW MODERN TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REACH THEM AND THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN CALIFORNIA- GOVERNMENT CULTURE AS AS AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO LIVES WITH WITH VERY QUICK AND- THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- IT'S INTERESTING TO CREATE A NEW CENTER FOR GOVERNMENT THE CENTER FOR GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE AND IT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT. BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO CREATE A CENTER TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN TELL YOU DIRECTLY HOW COLD IT IS IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK THE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A COORDINATED EFFORT WITH THIS PARTICULAR- CENTER. BUT THE COORDINATED EFFORT IN THE OPPORTUNITY ALREADY EXISTS IF THE ADMINISTRATION SIMPLY ACTUALLY COORDINATED AND COMMUNICATED. NEEDS AND GOALS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT THESE COMMUNITIES. AND SO I SAW THAT THAT WAS A COMPLETE- LACK OF SAFETY NET FOR MANY OF US ESPECIALLY THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE HIT HARDEST BY COLD AT MINE INCLUDED. I REPRESENTATIVE SAID IT MULTIPLE TIMES IN THIS HEARING. I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT HAS TWENTY PERCENT. BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE MAKES STATUS UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES. THE CENSUS COUNT WAS INCREDIBLY LOW IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE KNOW THAT THE RESOURCES ARE NOT GOING TO BE THERE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN BE RESPONSIVE. AND YET. BASIC SOLUTIONS LIKE. COMMUNITY CLINICS OR SCHOOL SITES THAT ENABLE BETTER ABLE TO PROVIDE WALKABLE. CLOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO GET TESTED AND GET THE VACCINE. DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL WE PUSHED AND PUSHED AND PUSHED. AND SO IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST. TO TRY TO FIND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS THAT THOSE OF US TO COME FROM THE DISTRICT THAT WE REPRESENT. CAN QUICKLY ARTICULATE- IN NEED AND RESOURCES AND YET HERE WE ARE CREATING MORE DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE DATA TO CREATE COORDINATED EFFORTS. WHEN WE COULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER AND SO FOR ME I WANT TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION LIKE. WHAT DOES- EXCELLENCE IN GOVERNANCE LOOK LIKE TO YOU. IT'S JUST HARD TO GET AND I THINK- GOOD VERY GOOD QUESTION A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. SPECIALLY WHEN IT RELATES TO. ANY SUCH AS LANGUAGE ACCESS WHAT THE GOAL OF THE GET CENTER IS TO DO IS TO FIND THOSE THINGS AND STATE GOVERNMENT THAT WORK WELL IN AND HOW DO WE SCALE ENACTMENT COLUSA LANGUAGE ACCESS SOME DEPARTMENTS DO A LOT BETTER THAN OTHERS AT LANGUAGE ACCESS AS IT RELATES TO THEIR PROGRAMS AND HOW. AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WORLD OUT TO THE PUBLIC PEOPLE I STATE SERVICES AND SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TAKE THOSE PROGRAM SEE HOW THEY CURRENTLY WORK MORE STAFF WILL THEN. WORK ACROSS THE CONTROL AGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE BEST PRACTICES WE CAN SCALE STATEWIDE SO THAT THE CONSTITUENTS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO WE'LL HAVE THAT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO- WHETHER IT'S VACCINES SERVICES THREE SERVICES FOR THAT MATTER AT THE STATE AND THAT IS KIND OF A BALL HERE SO THAT WE HAVE A WAR ORDINATED CONSISTENT APPROACH WITH THINGS SUCH AS- LANGUAGE ACCESS. JUST OTHER TAXI OPERATION TO THESE ARE ALL TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION EVERYONE BE TREATED THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT IS THE GOAL HERE AND THE STAFF THERE WILL HELP US TO DO THAT TO RUN THESE PILOTS AND TROOPS TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS IN IN ABOUT A WEEK THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OPERATIONS. OF ALL STATE PARK. THANK YOU I THINK WITH JUST START THE BAT WITH EIGHTY. KELLY I C. DMV YOU DON'T NEED TO ANOTHER. CENTER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THOSE ARE SOME. VERY DIRECT THINGS SO WE CAN START WORKING ON ACCESS TO CLINICS. ACCESS TO- MORE DOCTORS IN THE MEDICAL SPACE WE HAVE NOW INCREASED ACCESS TO MEDICAL TO. UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS AS WELL BUT- WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY THERE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE DOCTORS AVAILABLE AND SO. I GET IT I UNDERSTAND BUT I CAN I AM HEARING MORE MORE FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. HURDLES TO GETTING TO ACCESS AND GETTING TO EQUITY UP BY. VERSUS LIKE THE REALITY THAT. THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE KNOW WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED AND SO I HOPE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT. OR NOT- I SHOULD SAY. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD THAT YOU JUST MADE WE WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON SOME AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN STATE OPERATIONS THIS IS A- DEFINITELY A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND EVERYONE. HAS REALLY GOOD IDEAS ON WHERE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS RELATED TO THE PILOTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO. ENGAGE IN FUTURE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM AND MUCH APPRECIATED I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF- THAT'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE ESPECIALLY WITH LANGUAGE ACCESS WHICH WE KNOW IS. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY AXIS. AS WELL THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTEEN OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. WE WILL BEGIN A WIN- THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH MR SAMUELSON. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM IS IN MY CAMERA IS NOT WORKING YOU DON'T SEE MAYBE YOU COULD SEE ME NOW BETTA. THANK YOU.

I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND- COMPOUND RESEARCH- B. SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL BASED ON- COSTS OR COSTS FROM THE STATE'S PREVIOUS OFFENCES AND CORBETT NINETEEN INITIATIVES WOULD CREATE THE- OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. TO MANAGE- PRIMARILY THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC AWARENESS AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS. AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. RESPONSE THE STATE INVESTED IN BUILDING CRITICAL OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR REACHING COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST SOCIAL AND HEALTH INEQUITIES. A POST OFFICE WOULD BUILD UPON THIS WORK AND DIRECTLY TACKLE THE CHALLENGES FACED BY BOTH THE STATE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN HELPING TO DRIVE MAJOR INITIATIVES THROUGH TEMPORARY OR POP POP. INFRASTRUCTURES THE PROPOSED ONGOING FUNDING WOULD ESTABLISH PERMANENT PARTNERSHIPS THAT STRENGTHEN. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. OKAY ARE IS AN INTERSECTIONAL SIX BODY ADULT REGULARLY CONVENES CABINET LEVEL EITHER SHIP OUT TO ADDRESS CROSS CUTTING ISSUES SO HOUSING THAT OFFICER OPR- THAT IS APPROPRIATE- IT IS ALSO A PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE OTHER PROGRAMS UNDER THE OFFICE OF CHARLES- THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. I'LL STOP ABOUT INTO WE HAD A YEAR LEFT SPEND DENTAL CARE STUFF AND MYSELF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN WE HAVE THE OF FIND PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR KEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE CAN- WITH. ASSESSMENT IN JUST ONE UNDERSCORE THAT OPR OR REGULATE ALREADY REGULARLY CONVENES CABINET LEVEL LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESS TO CROSS DEPARTMENTAL ISSUES. AND HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS TO OVERSEE EFFECTIVE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGNS. LET'S OPR IS REALLY WELL POSITIONED OVERSEAS THE NEW OFFICE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING- AS A PURIST CHARGE AN EXPERTISE IS BASED ON LONG RANGE PLANNING AND CROSS DEPARTMENTAL HIGHLY COMPLEX PROJECTS SUCH AS- THESE THAT REPORTING. I DON'T LIKE TO JUST TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO- RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THE L. A. O. IS PRESENTED- IN REGARDS TO- WHAT AMOUNT OF PLANNING IS NECESSARY- THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS BUILT AROUND A BUDGET. THAT'S THE STATE'S LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS THROUGHOUT CYCLES OF CAMPAIGNS AND RATHER THAN STANDING UP PARTNERSHIPS FOR EACH SPECIFIC NEW CAMPAIGN. AND GIVEN THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO DO THE WORK OF EVALUATING OVERALL RESOURCE NEEDS AND COSTS. AND SO THIS INCLUDES EVALUATING ONGOING. POSITIONS IN RESOURCE NEEDS ADMINISTRATION XTERRA PLANS ON PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS PART OF THE SPRING PROCESS- IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE OVERSEEING THE NEW OFFICE R. AS YOU'LL NOTE WE PROPOSE THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. IN OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IT STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING ADMINISTRATION WITH FLEXIBILITY AND MINISTERING THE OFFICE. IS ALSO ARE CLEARLY ARTICULATING THE PARAMETERS OF THE OFFICE MISSION AND THE SCOPE OF THEIR WORK- THAT WERE OPEN TO FEEDBACK AND CONTINUE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE T. B. L. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. THE BILL LANGUAGE EXPLICITLY REQUIRES THE OFFICE TO RATE- POTENTIAL CAMPAIGNS BASED ON. EIGHT OF YOU HAVE- EVALUATION METRICS AND THAT'S CLEARLY ARTICULATED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU L. L. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON FRIEND WHAT THE COURT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED A LEGITIMATE NEED WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THE PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THIS NEED BY SHOULD YOU AGREE THAT THIS CONCEPT HAS MERIT THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ON WHICH WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH IN ON INCLUDING MORE THAN ENTITIES SHOULD BE LOCATED WHAT AMOUNT OF ONGOING FUNDING IS JUSTIFIED. BY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND HOW AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH IN ON HOW THE NEW ENTITY SUCH A COVERAGE PROPERTIES AND HOW WOULD THE NEW ENTITY COORDINATE WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES- ARE FULL COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL IN THE AGENDA. AND ALL STOCK HERE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND WE'RE TO TALK IT LIKE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ALSO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE. OF CONTINUING TO REACH OUT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I'M HOPING THAT WE IN THE ASSEMBLY. CAN BE A PARTNER I THINK THAT'S A CONTINUED AND RECURRING THEME. AND THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY OUR HOUSE. HAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND PROVIDE INSIGHTFUL. A DISTRICT FOCUSED LENS THAT CAN HOPEFULLY. BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT. TO WHAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO RECOGNIZING. AND NOT REACHING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO WITH THAT EFFORT. HOW WILL APPEAR TO BE TARGETING THESE COMMUNITIES WHAT IS THE GAME PLAN ON THE GROUND. SO I CAN TAKE ON THAT SO WE'VE DEVELOPED CRITERIA BY WHICH WE WOULD- SELECT- IT IS- OUTLINED IN THE TRAILER BILL. WE HAVE- A FEW CRITERIA THAT ARE THAT ARE OUTLINED AROUND EQUITY FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY TO TARGET AUDIENCES BUT OUR- THAT INCLUDE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OR EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST HEALTH AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES- ANOTHER CREDITOR CRITERIAS DATA INFORMED DECISION SO. FOR EXAMPLE RESPECTIVE AGENCIES STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE AND OR CON PROVIDE ISSUE. A SPECIFIC DATA TO INFORM STRATEGY AND- EVALUATION. THAT ACTIONABLE AREAS ARE ONE OF THE CRITERIA ISSUES THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE RELIABLE AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT CAN EMPOWER IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. A FOURTH ONE IS RISK SEVERITY AND URGENCY PRESENT A THREAT OR CONCERN FOR THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF THE TARGETED AUDIENCE- OUR AUDIENCES COORDINATION AND THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IN PART OF WARRANTY- OPR IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE- WE CONSTANTLY ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS- AGENCY COORDINATION SO THIS WILL BE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES. OR DEPARTMENTS I MENTIONED THAT STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL FOR EXAMPLE BETTER SEVEN AGENCIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED JUSTIN DOT BUCKET BUT THE OFFICE WORKS ACROSS MANY AGENCIES AND THEN LAST ONE EMERGING- MERCHANT MATTERS AND THEN- OUTCOMES ISSUES THAT HAVE CLEAR AND MEASURABLE GOALS. AND WE HAVE A SHORT TIME BUT ALSO THE KEY CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY WORK WITH TH LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THE PROGRAM DEVELOPS TO IDENTIFY. THE WAY- COMPANIES. GET SELECTED. THANK YOU FOR THE AS THIS IS AN INITIAL THAT PART OF THE GOVERNOR OFFICE VERSUS A STATE DEPARTMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FLOODING CONCERNS REGARDING THE CONTINUING OF THE PROGRAM BEYOND OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR'S TERM. HOW CAN YOU HELP HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. THE I'M SORRY FOR THE FACT THAT THIS IS THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. VERSUS THE DEPARTMENT. YES SO AGAIN THERE'S NO OTHER AGENCY THAT HAS THE SINGLE- THAT THAT- STRUCTURE THAT REALLY REACHES OUT TO ALL CROSS CUTTING ISSUES I THINK OPR BY STATUES ACTUALLY CREATED TO ADAPT AND TO ADVISE BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND NOT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY THE WORK IT HAS BEEN DOING BUT I THINK THE CENTRAL ISSUE IS. THERE IS NO BETTER STRUCTURE WITHIN THIS ESTATE AGENCIES THAT HAS THE MOST- CROSSCUTTING ISSUES THAT OPR AS PART OF ITS START YOU UP TO THE- ENGAGES IN SO. THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY- IT MAY BE NAMED BUT STRUCTURE AS THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR BUT IT IS PRETTY MUCH ALMOST- AT AN AGENCY THAT SURPRISING AND ADVISES- BOTH ARE BRANCHES. AND HOW IS THE SIXTY FIVE MILLION- DOLLAR AMOUNT CREATED WHERE DID THAT COME ABOUT. SO THOSE BASED ON THE LESSONS FONG A LOT THE LAST CENSUS AND CORBETT- THERE IS MUCH LARGER AMOUNTS IDENTIFIED THERE SO THE SIXTY FIVE WAS BASED ON THAT- EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF THE- AND SO CURRENTLY IT'S DIVIDED INTO. POTENTIALLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO- FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR STATE OPERATIONS THE FIFTY MILLION IT I BELIEVE ALMOST HALF OF WHAT WAS- THAT- THAT SENSES OKAY WELL FROM THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM. I THINK I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP- THE CENSUS QUITE A BIT IN IN THE CONVERSATION. SO MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST COUNTED IN THE CENSUS AS I'VE MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW AND THIS BUDGET HEARING JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. EXPERIENCED CODED WELL WE'RE ALSO EXPERIENCING EXPERIENCED THE CENSUS COUNT AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH LOWER ESPECIALLY IN UNINCORPORATED EAST LOS ANGELES AND ON THE EAST SIDE IN GENERAL. SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SOUTH LOS ANGELES ALSO- EXPERIENCE THE SAME I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT MAYBE WE LOOK AT CENSUS TRACTS AND THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS THAT. WERE VASTLY MOVED AND SHIFTED BECAUSE OF CENSUS AND MY SIDE OF THE- THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE ACTUALLY LOST A HISTORIC SEAT AND I WAS THE SEAT OF. CONGRESSWOMAN LUCILLE ROYBAL ALLARD. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF- BECAUSE OF THE LOWER NUMBER THRESHOLD- TO THE CENSUS SO. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU START. IN AREAS LIKE FINE AND OTHERS ACROSS THE DISTRICT IN WHICH WE KNOW CENSUS NUMBERS ARE MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT WE KNOW ACTUALLY IS THE LIVED EXPERIENCE. OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO CAN I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL AT LEAST IN SOME GUIDANCE. IN WHERE TO GET STARTED AND I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE ACROSS THE STATE BUT- BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCED A SPECIFIC LOSS OF A MEMBER OF CONGRESS- AND THE EXPANSION OF CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF IT. I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THAT TO BE RECOGNIZED. YEAH I THINK IT'S SO THE CENTRAL PART OF THIS THINKING I THINK IS HOW DO WE SUPPORT THE CBO SAID LOCAL COMMUNITY SO WHEN I SAY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS TO SUPPORT. THAT TO. CREATE LOCAL RESOURCES AND MAKE THAT PERMANENT IS NO ONE KNOWS THE LOCAL ISSUES BETTER BETTER BETTER THAN THE CBO. WE WANT TO FORMALIZE THAT. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE RAISING OF THE UNDER COUNTY- ISSUES. THEY ARE MORE TRUSTED DONE OBVIOUSLY- OTHER CONSULTANTS OR GOVERNMENTS- OPERATIONS SO WE WANT TO BUILD ON THE TRUST. AND RESOURCE OF LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP AGAIN MORE THRUST AND WE'RE- HOPING IT OUT BUT WE BELIEVE. THAT WOULD HAVE MORE. AND OFF IN THE COMMENTS BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT IS- AND SPECIALLY NOW WITH. REDISTRICTING IT IS AN ISSUE AND IN TERMS OF WHERE WE START WILL DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO- ONE THREE IN A- WORK ON THE DETAILS- OF. THE SELECTION PROCESS. AS THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND I APPRECIATE YOU SAY THAT SAYING THAT ARE ALSO INCREDIBLY OVERWORKED AND UNDERFUNDED. AND SO IT'S ADDING ON TO ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRESSURES AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT THEN WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE ALSO FUND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOOD PARTNERS. TO THE WORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING TO DO IN AN EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO HELP AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE REMARKABLE IN THE PREVIOUS A NUMBER OF CHALLENGING OF THE CENSUS WAS OR THE OUTREACH THROUGH CORBETT WAS- THE- STOCK THAT'D BE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF AGENCIES. I BUILD A SIGNIFICANT DATABASE ABOUT FIVE CBO ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT AND COME BACK AND- YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS TO TEN YEARS LATER RATHER WE- RESOURCE GOALS AND WORK WITH THEM. TO HOW ABOUT CONTINUATION AND FORMALIZATION- I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE- PREVIOUSLY- OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FUN- WORKING FACT BE OF COLD AND IN SOME CASES BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF SELF I THINK THIS STATE AND THIS PROPOSAL IS I BELIEVE THE HEAD OF- OTHER. STATES THAT A LOT OF PLACES ARE LOOKING TO FORMALIZE THIS KIND OF ENGAGEMENT AND RESOURCE LOCAL PPO. FOR THIS PURPOSE HERE DIRECTOR SEVEN MUCH APPRECIATED AND I AGAIN I WANT TO DO I WANT TO MAKE TAKE A MOMENT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE QUEUE IN THE CREATION OF THE TREE PROGRAM WHICH HELPED UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES RECEIVE SOME SMALL BENEFITS- IN THE START OF- IN THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WHICH A LOT OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE A HUGE PART. IN MAKING SURE THAT FUNDING WAS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD TO MOVE QUICKLY SO I DO AGREE THAT THERE'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY THERE IF IT'S DONE APPROPRIATELY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE PANELIST ON ISSUE NUMBER. SIXTEEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE. THREE MORE TO GO BEFORE WE ARE ALMOST DONE WITH OUR HEARING FOR TODAY. WE ARE NOW ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN WITH CAROLINE TEARS WE'RE GONNA START WITH MR JOSH FRIDAY. THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS JOSH FRIDAY AND THE CHIEF SERVICE OFFICER FOR CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. AND CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS THIS YEAR CURRENTLY HAS THREE BUDGET PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION ONE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ACTION COURT. TO IS A NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM AND THREE IS THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS PROGRAM. STARTING UP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION COURT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEKS TO MAKE ONGOING THE LIMITED TERM INVESTMENT OF THREE POINT EIGHT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN A PROGRAMMATIC CLIMATE PROGRAMS. FOR A TOTAL ONGOING REQUEST A FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THIS INITIAL APPROPRIATION RECEIVED IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED ONGOING STAFF IN ONLY THREE YEARS OF FUNDING. FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND NOW WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THIS PROGRAMMATIC FUNDING BE ON GOING TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM LET LEVERAGES FEDERAL AMERICORPS FUNDING AND WHILE IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES THE INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL WITH MORE INTEREST IN APPLICATIONS AND POSITIONS PRESS THE BILL. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM IT'S RECENTLY BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT AS A MODEL FOR A POTENTIAL NATIONAL CLIMATE COURT IT'S BEING WATCHED AND STUDIED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CRITICAL. TO MEETING OUR STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS WE HAVE PROVIDED INITIAL OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS WILL DEVELOP AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE OUTCOMES HOW ARE FUNDING AS LEVERAGE AND ANALYZES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. THEN THE PROPOSAL FOR THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR- BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS BUDGET PROPOSALS. THEY BUILD ON THE SUCCESS WHICH WE HAVE HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC ACTIVATING CALIFORNIANS TO SERVE AND TACKLE SOME OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. DURING THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS LUNCH THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM LEVERAGING PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DISASTER FUNDING. AND NOW WE ARE REQUESTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THIS PROGRAM AND THE BILL THAT OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO FOR FUTURE DISASTERS AS WELL AS TO MEET OTHER STATE PRIORITIES. THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE OUR NEIGHBORS TO BE THE FIRST LINE OF SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO CONNECT NEIGHBORS TO TAKE ACTION AND TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER. SHORTLY AFTER WE LAUNCHED THE PROGRAM DURING COBIT. MY OFFICE MEDIC COUPLE FROM- THE INLAND REGION THAT HAS LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON ALL OF US ANDI THINK DEMONSTRATES THE WAY THIS PROGRAM. CAN HAVE AN IMPACT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT I REMEMBER JEAN WHO IS EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD THE TIME HER HUSBAND BEN A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD. WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE HAD BEEN UNDER SELF QUARANTINE FOR WEEKS STARTED TO RUN OUT OF FOOD AND SUPPLIES. AND AFTER NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND A LOCAL STORE TO DELIVER TO THEIR HOME JEAN ACTUALLY REACHED OUT THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO ALL THE MOVIE ARRANGE THE DELIVERY OF MILK. AEGS TOILET PAPER AND OTHER GOODS TO THE COUPLE SO THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND AS WELL AS OTHERS DISASTERS. WE HAVE LEARNED AND WE HAVE SEEN THE CRITICAL NATURE OF EMPOWERING NEIGHBORS TO HELP EACH OTHER. AND WE ARE EXCITED TO BUILD THIS OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS WE SEE BEING CRITICAL FOR ISSUES AND ACTIVITIES ALSO BEYOND JUST DISASTER WEATHER AND CLIMATE ACTION. FIGHTING POVERTY. OR MEETING OTHER COMMUNITY NEEDS. LASTLY THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS A ONE TIME PILOT TO EXPAND THESE AMERICORPS PROGRAMS. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW- THE CALIFORNIA ON. ARE THE LARGE AMERICO AMERICORPS PORTFOLIO IN THE COUNTRY SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A PASSED THROUGH A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPETITIVELY APPLY. FOR IN OUR WARD IT GRANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TWO PROGRAM MODELS. WHILE THE TYPICAL DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS AMERICORPS MEMBERS. ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS AGES EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT THAT BUILT ON CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS LEADERSHIP AND SRVICE. AND COMPREHENSIVELY EXPAND SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO ORDER CALIFORNIANS. AS WITH ALL THESE PROPOSALS AND ALL OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS REMAINS VERY COMMITTED. TO SHOWING OUR IMPACT DEMONSTRATING AN IMPACT AND DELIVERING ON THE INTENT OF THESE INITIATIVES AND LIFTING UP. ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES I'M ALSO JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE I HEAR ANTHONY CHAVEZ. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU MISS FRIDAY LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLACE- KEVIN CLARK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE WE CONCUR WITH STEVIE'S- COMMENTS UP TO THIS POINT AND WE JUST POINT OUT. TO RESPOND WILL BE THE L. A. S. COMMENTS THAT BOTH OUR CLIMATE ACTION CORPS AND FOSTER PARENTS AND SENIOR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM PROPOSALS. HAVE INCLUDED- PRIOR OUTCOMES FROM PRIOR INVESTMENTS AND CV IS PROVIDED INTERIM REPORTING LIKE I MENTIONED FOR THEIR CLIMATE ACTION CORPORATE GRAHAM. AND WE ALSO JUST NOTES AS DID THE L. A. O. WITH THEIR COMMENTS THAT CV'S CHARGE. INCLUDES DISASTER RESPONSE AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FIT SQUARELY WITHIN US CALIFORNIA MONSTERS OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU I'LL- BRIAN WITH A BIRD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPANDED STATE FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUIRE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS IT'S BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND IT'S INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA% VOLUNTEERS FUND WHICH RECEIVES PRIVATE SECTOR DONATIONS TO. TO PREPARE N ANNUAL REPORT TO PROVIDE AN ACCOUNTING OF ALL OF ITS ACTIVITIES VOLUNTEER MEMBERSHIP AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IT THIS REPORT SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE FISCAL COMMITTEES OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE THE RESPONSIVENESS OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TO THESE CONCERNS- PREVIOUSLY DURING THIS BUDGET CYCLE AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED INITIAL REPORTING ON THEIR- NEWER INITIATIVES. ON THAT SAID WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IN PERMANENTLY ESTABLISHED THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR. FINISHED IF. WE DO SEE IT AS A AS A BIT OF AN EXPANSION OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES BEYOND ADMINISTERING THE STATE AMERICORPS PROGRAMS AND COORDINATING DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS. BUT OTHER STATE AGENCIES- SO CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TRADITIONALLY SERVICE ROLES FOR MAKING GRANTS THOSE NONPROFITS IN CBO'S PLAY FOR FUNDING. FOR THE AMERICA SERVICE PROGRAMS. AND WITH THE NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR PROGRAM IT'S UNCLEAR WHY- THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS BY THERE'S A COMPELLING NEED FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE. THE NEW COORDINATION OUTREACH MARKETING AND TRAINING SERVICES THAT WERE OUTLINED THIS PROPOSAL. SO WE SUGGEST YOU ASK CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TO EXPLAIN WHAT ASPECTS OF ALL INTEREST IN THE STATE ARE NOT WORKING WELL. AND HOW THIS. PROPOSAL WOULD SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS THE CALIFORNIA ACTION FOR PROGRAM. HOWEVER SHOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE- THE PROVIDING US FIRM STATE COMMITMENT FOR THIS FUNDING FUNDING FOR. GRAHAM COULD BE BENEFICIAL LEVERAGING THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING WE WOULD. INSTEAD RECOMMEND PROVIDING ANOTHER ROUND OF THREE YEARS OF TEMPORARY FUNDING THREE TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. YEAH YOU SHOULD ALSO PLAN TO REVIEW THE OUTCOMES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CLIMATE ACTION CORPS PROGRAM IN SEVERAL YEARS WHEN MORE INFORMATION IS. MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU. AND LASTLY WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS AND SENIOR COMPANIONS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS EXPAND SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS AND THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED FEWER SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. AND FEELING LESS SOCIALLY ISOLATED. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER WHETHER FOR TO FEEL LIKE YOU WERE YOU WERE RUSHING THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION. S. AS WELL AS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH OUR- OUR LAST COUPLE OF PANELS HERE MUCH APPRECIATED I- I AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE TOO- MISTER FRIDAY AS WELL- WILL- CAL POLY TEARS BE OPEN TO CREATING A ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PROVIDES THE DATA INDICATED. A TO THE LEGISLATURE. YES MEDICARE. THANK YOU AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST BRIEFLY WHAT THE CALDERON TEARS PROGRAMS CURRENTLY LOOK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY L. A. COUNTY IF YOU CAN. SURE SO ALL I'LL POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE CLIMATE ACTION COURT- WHICH WAS A FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAM TO ENGAGE EVERYONE IN CLIMATE ACTION- WE FOCUSED ON A FEW SPECIFIC FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED BY- BY CLIMATE CHANGE WITH EQUITY BEING FRONT AND CENTER BOTH OF EQUITY IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE ENGAGING IN OUR PROGRAM. AND EQUITY IN TERMS OF WHAT COMMUNITIES WE ARE INVESTING IN LOS ANGELES WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS AND IS ONE OF OUR MOST ROBUST COMMUNITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY ENGAGE WITH OUR CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAM SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THROUGH OUT LA CITY AND THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY- THAT ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON- THINGS LIKE PROVIDING URBAN GREENING PROGRAMS IN URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITIES. THAT WE KNOW HAVE BEEN SEVERELY UNDER INVESTED WHEN IT COMES TO TREE CANOPY BECAUSE OF RED LIGHT HISTORY OF REDLINING AND OTHER UNDER INVESTMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED THERE WERE ALSO FOCUSED ON DOING THINGS LIKE FOOD RECOVERY BOTH TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- IN REDIRECTING EXTRA FOOD BUT ALSO TO DEAL. WITH THE STATE'S GOALS AROUND REDUCING FOOD WASTE- IS MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE ARE TAKING OUR PROGRAMS AND VERY MUCH FOCUSING IN PLACES LIKE L. A. COUNTY- IN AN ALLEY CITY- WHERE WE NEED TO- SUPPORT- COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER INVESTED HISTORICALLY WE ALSO HAVE DOZENS OF- OF AMERICORPS PROGRAMS THERE- IN IN L. A. COUNTY IN IN THE REGION- AND WE- ALSO JUST ANNOUNCED RECENTLY. A COLLEGE COR PROGRAM THAT ENGAGES IN PROGRAMS LIKE KERN UNIVERSITIES LIKE UCLA CAL STATE LA DOMINGUEZ HILLS- THE COMMUNITY COMMENDED SEVERAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN LA TO PROVIDE DEBT FREE PATHWAYS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE FOR A YEAR- WE ACTUALLY LAUNCH THE PILOT FOR THIS PROGRAM AT CAL STATE LA. TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY THERE- IT A SPECIFICALLY. WE ALSO- HAVE RECENTLY AND NOW THEY WERE DOING A U. JOBS CORPS PROGRAM IN L. A. COUNTY WERE INVESTING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO HIRE LOW INCOME YOUTH YOUTH THAT ARE FORMING CARS RATED YOUTH THAT HAVE BEEN TO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM YOUTH THAT ARE ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING IN THE LABOR MARKET. TO REALLY LAUNCH THEM ON A SUCCESSFUL CAREER AS A SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY SO WE ARE HAPPY MEDICARE TO PROVIDE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF EVERYTHING HAPPENING IN LA. NOW THEY COUNTY AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE INVESTMENTS. THAT WE'RE MAKING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. CAN YOU SHARE BY NAME OR THE PARTNERS THAT YOU HAVE ON THE GROUND AND NÂNG- SO WE- ON THE CLIMATE SIDE WE WORK WITH. GROUPS LIKE CITY PLANTS. WE'RE WORKING WITH WHAT WHAT'S RISING- IN LA WERE WORKING- WITH LA THEY L. A. RIVER GROUP- WE ARE- WE HAVE A JUMPSTART IS ONE OF OUR IMPORTANT. AIR CORPS PROGRAMS THAT IS WORKING IN DOING- EDUCATION WORK AND MENTORING WORK- SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A EXAMPLES OF A FEW BUT WE LITERALLY FUND AND GRANTS TO DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN LOS ANGELES AND AGAIN WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. YOU IN YOUR OFFICE- THAT COLISTIN AND ALL THE DETAILS OF HOW MUCH WE'RE INVESTING IN WHERE WE'RE INVESTING. THANK YOU I THINK WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A MISTER MISTER FRIDAY NOT ONLY WITH WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING TODAY BUT WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE HEARING TODAY. IS HOW THAT INFORMATION IS BEING TRACED BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT REPRESENTS. THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT THE LOS ANGELES RIVER THE UPPER L. A. RIVER. AROUND DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES LINCOLN HEIGHTS IN CHINATOWN. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING GRANTS TO THE RIVER PARTNERS IN MY DISTRICT AND SO I'M FEELING A LITTLE- OUT OF THE LOOP ON SOMETHING THAT BENEFITS MY COMMUNITY DIRECTLY. AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO FIND OUT AS TO HOW THIS INFORMATION IS BEING- SHARED. AND HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING SHARED WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT REPRESENT THESE COMMUNITIES. YEAH THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE QUESTION AND THAT'S ON US AND I WOULD. WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU AND WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ANYTIME- WE'VE WE'VE OFFERED TO COME AND SPEAK TO THE ENTIRE CAUCUS- AND DO IT. ABOUT PRESENTATION OF EVERYWHERE THEY WERE INVESTING- BUT WE FULLY TAKE TO HEART- YOUR I THINK INVITATION TO- TO SIT DOWN AND SHARE WHERE WE'RE INVESTING WHO WERE INVESTING WITH THEM. AND HOW REALLY WERE TRYING TO LIFT UP THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU REPRESENT. AND THE HOPE IS THAT AS WE'RE DOING THESE WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOU- TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS ACCESSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING JOBS FOR- YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING LABOR MARKET IN YOUR DISTRICT- THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO TAKE CLIMATE ACTION AND- AND RECEIVE A STIPEND AND THE SCHOLARSHIP FOR COLLEGE IF YOU DO TAKE CLIMATE ACTION. WITH YOUR DISTRICT AND DEBT FREE PATHWAYS TO LOW INCOME SCHOOL SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THESE PROGRAMS AND- WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO BE MORE OPEN AND- TRANSPARENT. WITH YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING INVESTED. DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO YOU WHEN PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THAT CAN TELL ME. YOU KNOW FOR AND I KNOW IT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING TO GO DIRECTLY DISTRICT BY DISTRICT BUT AT LEAST L. A. COUNTY OR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WHAT IS YOUR VOLUNTEER BASE LIKE THE KELOLAND HERE'S AN AND MY CITY OR IN MY COUNTY ALONE. YEAH YES WE CAN THE ANSWER IS YES- AND WHAT I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT. I'M SORRY WITH THAT. FIND THE MORE THEY COME FROM HOW DO YOU OUT REACH TO THEM. A LOT OF IT IS WITH IN COORDINATION WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND SO SPECIFICALLY IN LA FOR INSTANCE WE GRANT TO AND WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH L. A. WORKS. WE ALSO GRANTING WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CORE- AN ORGANIZATION BASED IN LA AROUND AT PROVIDING VOLUNTEERS FOR DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS SO WE WORK WITH THEM TO RECRUIT VOLUNTEERS- IT'S ALSO WHY FOR A NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR CAMPAIGN WE WANT TO HELP BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. US SO THAT THAT WE CAN HELP TRAIN AND IDENTIFY LOCAL LEADERS IN NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAN THEN DO THE RECRUITING- AND ENGAGING OF VOLUNTEERS- WE CAN IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE INFORMATION BOUT WHAT VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE RECRUITED A LANE THAT IN FOR INSTANCE. THAT WE FOCUSED AND SUPPORTING THE FOOD BANKS WHICH IS A MAJOR OPERATION THAT WE LED OPERATION FEED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO SUPPORT- THE LA FOOD BANK AMONG MANY OTHERS- AS A RESULT IN WE CAN GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS OF HOW MANY VOLUNTEERS- WE'VE SUPPORTED FOOD BANKS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WITH- THE TRUTH IS THOUGH- AND I THINK THIS IS ALSO REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE- REMARKS FROM THE L. A. L. O. DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR NAME IS CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS- WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO BUILD OUT BECAUSE OF THE- THE VERY RECENT- INVESTMENTS HAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE- WE'RE- JUST BEGINNING TO BUILD OUT. VOLUNTEER INFRASTRUCTURE AND ANY ABILITY TO RECRUIT TRAIN OR KEEP TRACK OF VOLUNTEERS AND SO AS WE WERE STARTING- WE ARE BUT AS I'VE MENTIONED HAPPY TO PROVIDE. ALL OF THE DATE DETAILS AND METRICS- BUT WE ARE JUST BEGINNING THIS PROCESS AND THIS IS THIS IS NEW FOR- THEY THIS AGENCY DESPITE THE FACT THAT- OUR NAMES CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS MOVE ON THE ISSUE I'LL JUST PUT SOMETHING UP ON YOUR RADAR- PERHAPS A COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE ALLEY UST LOCALLY. THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER CERTAIN HOURS SO VOLUNTEERING ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE THE MEANS AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITHOUT GETTING PAID. THAT'S VERY HARD FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY POST COBIT AMID RECOVERY TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO JUST VOLUNTEER TIME IT'S A IT'S A WONDERFUL ENDEAVOR. BUT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY ARE ALSO TRYING TO. HELP THEIR FAMILIES AND PAY THE RENT AND PROVIDE AND THAT'S A- A BURDEN THAT IS NOT OFTEN SHARED ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO I SAY THAT TO YOU IN AN EFFORT TO SAY THERE COULD BE A COLLABORATION. OF ALREADY AN EXISTING GRADUATING REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN ALSO EXPAND ON CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. YEAH IT'S A IT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE AND THE SPIRIT OF YOUR QUESTION IS ALSO WHY WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT. WE'VE INCREASED THE SCHOLARSHIP FOR SERVICE OF UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA- DID TO PUT TOWARDS IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL IT'S WHY WE WE'VE PUT SO MUCH. FOCUS ON GRADING SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES THAT DO CREATE JOBS THAT DO. PROVIDE A STIPEND AND A SCHOLARSHIP SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE AND THE IDEA OF EXPANDING WORKING WITH SCHOOL BOARDS TO EXPAND AND MAKE THIS THE CULTURE OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. IS EXACTLY THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CALIFORNIA GOING TO YEARS SO- WE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT SUGGESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT- MUCH APPRECIATED WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. AND WE ARE. QUICKLY WRAPPING UP. ADDITIONAL BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR OPR MR ASSEFA YOU'RE BACK ON. GREAT THANK YOU BUT I'M CARE TO ALL START WITH THE ON AND I'LL TRY TO BE REALLY QUICK I'LL START WITH HIGHER EDUCATION. THE- CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB OR CELL WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE- BUDGET OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO IMPROVE LEARNING OUTCOMES AND CLOSE. EQUITY GAPS AND OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES. ESPECIALLY THE KINDS OF GAPS WE SEE FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PURSUING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS OR KNOWN AS SPAM. BILLS UP THE BUDGET INCLUDES THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TOO MANY ENOUGH WHICH IS- TO RESTORE CUTS MADE THAT THREE DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC AND WOOD CREEK SOUTH THAT GROUNDBREAKING CUP ABILITIES TO PRE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND THE EXPANSION OF ON OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE PROJECT IN STATEN ACROSS ALL THREE SEGMENTS OF OUR EDUCATION. UC CSU AND COOK COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS INVESTMENT WILL REDUCE- EDUCATIONAL COSTS FOR STUDENTS- BUT YOU MENTIONED MADAM CHAIR THE CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME- AND PEOPLE OF COLOR FAMILIES. AT THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR A GRANT TO THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE CLIMATE RESEARCH BOB. VISIBILITY IN PASADENA. AND THEN- A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ESTABLISH THE GOLDEN STATE AWARDS GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCENTIVIZING AND ELEVATING HIGH IMPACT INNOVATIONS CREATED IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO STOP THE REST CORRECT ROSA A PARDON THE INTERRUPTION I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PROPOSALS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT THE L. A. O. DOES HAVE CONCERNS WITH JUST A FEW. SO WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND HEAR FROM. AT THE CONCERNS AND THEN MAYBE TRY TO ADDRESS THEM BECAUSE THE REST OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEM TO BE- IN ALIGNMENT SO LET'S- LET'S HEAR FROM THE L. A- IF YOU DON'T MIND. FOR THANK. I THINK YOU THIS IS BRIAN WEATHERFORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AN ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS YOU NOTED- ARE A COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ON THE AGENDA AND WE DO NOT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT MOST OF. BUDGET PROPOSAL. OF THE ONE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO- HIGHLIGHT IS OUR- OF THE PROPOSED- GOLDEN STATE HIGHER EDUCATION AWARDS PROPOSAL. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE STATE IS DONE THE SORT OF THING IN THE PAST AND WE WOULD CAUTION AGAINST DOING SO AGAIN. AND WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL- BECAUSE IT IN PARTICULAR HAS A FUNDAMENTALLY POOR DESIGN. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS- THAT IN FURTHER DETAIL PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT WILL GO INTO THE SPECIFIC- PROPOSAL SMITH A DIRECTOR OF SUCH. YOU GO UP THERE.

SIMILAR PROJECTS TO THESE IN THE PAST I THINK WE'VE WE'VE FOUND- THE SPONSORSHIP OF INNOVATION TO BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL ACTIVITY FOR THE STATE'S UNDERTAKING AND ONE THAT THE ANSWER THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS. TRECORA SUFFERED DO YOU WANT TO- SPEAK IN PARTICULAR TO THESE PROPOSALS. AGAINTHAT BY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO PROVIDE THIS PLAN BUT OF ALL BE HAPPY TO.

WE WILL THANK YOU SO MUCH I DIRECTOR AND DO WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME- THIS LAST ISSUE IS ON. XS ZERO FIVE WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER CHRIS HEALTH. GOOD AFTERNOON CRYSTAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARINGS LITTLE TRYING ON A BRIEF AND LYFT POINTS- THE ROOT OF THIS ISSUE LIES IN THE EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUND STATUTES IN THE- ALL LICENSE FEES WHAT'S THAT. UNDER CURRENT LAW. A SMALL REVENUE OFTEN BOND WITH REPORTERS. AND CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS REGARDLESS OF NOT MONEY INTO THE ROUTE WHICH THEN GOES TO THE CAPE- TO THAT THE SCHOOLS WITH AN ACCOUNTING. AND- UNDER ONE OF THE LAWS OF THE EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION ONE OF THE ROUTE IRAP MONIES CANNOT GO TO WATER REFERRED TO AS BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS WHAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE FULLY FUNDED TO THEIR- LOCAL. FORMULA THAT'S BUILDING. THE THIRTY UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE YEP YEP MALEGAON I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR AUDIO YOU'RE YOU'RE BREAKING UP QUITE A BIT. L. I'M SORRY I'M TELL MAYBE IF WE TRY TRY ENOUGH IT MAY BE FISCALLY TURNING OFF THE VIDEO YOUR AUDIO MY COMMAND A LITTLE BIT CLEARER LET'S TRY THAT. CORRECT OUT OF. IS IT COMING FROM WORKING WITH. IF YOU CAN CONTINUE LEVEL YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU MORE. ALL RIGHT. SO I'LL JUST DUMB TAKE IT FROM THE TOP EACH COUNTY HAS AN EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUND INTO WHICH ON THE CITY'S THE COUNTING ON THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS PART OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX THAT GOES TO BENEFIT THE SCHOOLS. UNDER THE. IT'S NOT GO TO ARE REFERRED TO AS BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS AND A BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL THE SCHOOL THIS WEEK BUT IT TO ITS REVENUE LIMITS WITH PROPERTY TAX. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN A SITUATION WHERE. IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY. THAT IRAQ NOT BE FULLY ABSORBED. IT RAPID REFER TO IS ACCESS THE ROUTE AND IT IS VERY TURN TO THE CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. SO THAT'S WHAT ACCESS. THIS LICENSE FEES WHAT STATUTES- IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO FOURTEEN OCCURRED MINISTRATION REDUCE THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE FROM 2% 0065% THAT RESULTED IN A REVENUE LOSS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. IN THE STATE MAY HOLD THAT REVENUE LOSS BY ALLOWING. CITIES AND COUNTIES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THAT AIM TO THE ROCKS. AND IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE EASY ROUTE TO REIMBURSE. THE LOST THE. THANKS IS A PROPERTY TAX REVENUE SHIFTED FROM THE NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS THOSE ARE SCHOOLS WHICH RECEIVE STATE FUNDING BECAUSE ARE NOT FULLY FUNDED TO THEIR- REVENUE LIMITS THE PROPERTY TAX STATUTES. ACCESS THE ROUTE WHICH IS RETURN TO CITIES AND COUNTIES DOES NOT COUNT BOARD HANG THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE BACK BILL FOR THE CITIES AND COUNTIES INSTEAD. WHAT HAPPENED. THE CARD FOR JUST PROJECT REVENUE THE BASIC AID FROM THE NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS. THANK IS A TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PAY THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEES WHAT. AND WHAT ARE TRAILER BILL PROPOSES TO DO IS TWO THINGS. FIRST OUR TRAILER BILL SAYS THAT. BEYOND ACCESS THE ROUTE WHICH IS RETURNED TO THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE ABSORBED BY THE SCHOOLS. SHALL HENCEFORTH BE COUNTED TOWARDS PAYING THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEEDBACK BILL FOR THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND WHAT ARE TRAILER. BILL ALSO DOES THAT SAYS IS INSUFFICIENT THE BILL A LOSS THE ADDRESS DOWN WE'RE CREATING CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FOR THE GENERAL FUND THE FACT THAT THE DIFFERENCE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT BACK BILL IS NOT REQUIRED HOWEVER THE STATE HAS BEEN PROVIDING THAT BACKED BILL FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW THE BEST PRACTICE. AND IT IS ESTIMATED TO COST APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR WHILE. SO WITHOUT HAVING AFTER THE MAIL. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE L. A- PLEASE MODEL THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- FISCAL YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES CHECK A PROCESS TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE STATE GENERAL FUND TO BACK THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THERE'S INSUFFICIENT IRAQ TO ADDRESS THE PLS POP. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO OFFSET THE STATE GENERAL FUND BACK FILLED WITH EXCESS EVEN HALF BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IMPORTANTLY IT IS UNIQUE THAT COUNTY TAP BOTH INSUFFICIENT YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE BLS WHAT. AND ACCESS YOU WRAP AFTER THE STATE SHARE. THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS MEANT FOR SCHOOLS. AXISDIRECT THE A SPECIAL CALL THEM. THAT CURRENTLY BENEFITS FIVE COUNTIES AND EXIST BECAUSE THEIR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS VERY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE STATUTORY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR COUNTIES WITHOUT EXCESS IRAQ THE BATTLE PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD CONSIST ENTIRELY OF STATE GENERAL FUND. IN CONCERT THE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION MAKES SENSE OF THE PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REIMBURSEMENTS. MORE QUICKLY THAN THE CURRENT PROCESS AND STREAMLINES THE PROCESS FOR CLEANING A BACK FILL. UNDER CURRENT PRACTICE THE STATE GENERAL FUND IS PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AN ANNUAL BUDGET. ACT OF APPROPRIATION ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO COVER INSUFFICIENT YOU WRAPPED. UP THE BACK WELL AS PROVIDED IN ARREARS CHART ALSO HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN PAST YEARS BUT GROWING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. COMBINED WITH MORE BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE INCREASED THE INSUFFICIENCIES. AND PROJECTIONS ASSUME CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE SHORTFALLS CONTINUE DELAYS IN THE BACK BILL. MAY BECOME MORE CHALLENGING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MANAGE AS THE PACKED FULL AMOUNTS GROW SINCE THE ELECT IS AN IMPORTANT. SOURCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE LOCAL REVENUE. I THE PROPOSED TBL A STAY COMPTROLLER OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING AS WELL AS AUDITING CLAIMS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OF INSUFFICIENT YOU WRAP UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IF YOU NEED THESE CLAIMS SCO DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE CAPACITY OR- THIS IS A POLICY EXPERTISE TO REVIEW THAT AND APPROVE THESE ECONOMY ROCK CLAIMS. ADDITIONALLY IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR SCO TO DEVELOP THIS EXPERTISE AS IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE. FOR THE DEPARTMENT TYPICALLY SCO MAKES PAYMENTS TO COUNTIES BASED ON DIRECTION PROVIDED TO THEM BY OTHER STATE ENTITIES THAT ADMINISTER RELEVANT PROGRAMS. SO WE ARE CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT STATE ENTITY WOULD BE BEST POSITIONED TO REVIEW AND APPROVE THESE CLAIMS. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO MEET BEFORE THE STEPS YOU KNOW PROCESS FOR PROVIDING A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FOR. INSUFFICIENTLY RAF THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- ONE ONE SECOND PLEASE. JUST UP REALLY QUICKLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS ACCESS IRAQ REVENUE IF THE BLF HAD NEVER BEEN REDUCED. I'M SORRY IF THE PEOPLE WERE REDUCED. NEVERBEEN REDUCED IF OF THE BILL UPWARDS STILL AT 2% OF THE VEHICLE'S VALUE THAN THIS ACCESS THE RAP WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO BE RETURNED TO THE ON THE DONOR CITIES AND THE COUNTIES IN THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE A VEHICLE LICENSE FEEDBACK BILL LOCATION SO THAT THAT REVENUE JUST DUMB FLOW. AFTER COOPER'S AT SOME SPILLOVER ACCESS THE RAP. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WE ARE DONE WITH THE FINAL ISSUE MUCH APPRECIATED WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT- ITEM OPENED WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT THE NUMBER SEVEN.

BASICALLY JUST MAKE THEM TAKE OTHER LOCAL MONEY TO COVER THE SHORTAGE. AND TO FIND OUT BY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU'D STILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CUTS. SO WE'RE HOPING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STATE TO COVER. WHAT THE COUNTY WOULD NEED TO JUST MAINTAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO GET ONE OVER ON THE STATE OR THE SCHOOLS.
