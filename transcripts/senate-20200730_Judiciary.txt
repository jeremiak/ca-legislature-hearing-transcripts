ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ON HIS BEHALF OUR MEMBER THE SENATOR CAN SOLVE THIS GONZALEZ WHO WILL BE PRESENTING FOR HIM GOOD MORNING SENATOR GONZALEZ THIS IS FILE ITEM ONE A. B. EXCUSE ME FILE ITEM TO A. B. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN YOU ARE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. AND TO FEEL FREE TO PROCEED GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN EXTENDS THE FILING DEADLINE FOR RETALIATION CLAIMS FOR THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT DLS SEE FROM SIX MONTHS TO ONE YEAR NOW OUT FROM LAST YEAR'S AB FOUR OH THREE FROM TWO YEARS TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE ALLOWS RECOVERY OF ATTORNEYS FEES TO PREVAILING EMPLOYEES AND ONLY APPLIES FOR WHISTLE BLOWER RETALIATION CLAIMS RETALIATION IS NOT ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM. DUE TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION AND THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF AVAILABLE DATA FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN IMMIGRATION RELATED RETALIATION CLAIMS FILED WITH THE T. L. S. E. INCREASED BY NEARLY 2000% AMID THE PANDEMIC ADVOCATES REPORT AN INCREASE IN CALLS REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND WE JUST UP AND MISS CLASSIFICATION. IT IS IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER THAT WE INSURE ALL LEGAL AND- AVENUES ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKERS WHO COME FORWARD. THE TWO MAIN BARRIERS WORKERS SPACE TO FILING A CLAIM ARE DRESSED IN THIS BILL. FIRST WORKERS WHO HAVE FACED RETALIATION ESPECIALLY IN EXTREME FORMS OF TERMINATION OR VIOLENCE NEED MORE TIME TO GATHER THE RESOURCES AND SEEK ASSISTANCE. A SIMPLE SIX MONTH EXTENSION FOR FILING A WORKER RETALIATION CLAIM WILL GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THEN. THEIR NEXT STEPS FOR RECOURSE. AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN ALSO BUILD UPON EXISTING ABILITIES FOR COURTS TO WORK REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES TO ATTORNEYS WHO TAKE THESE CASES ON BEHALF OF WORKERS. THIS IS NOT A BILL INTENDED TO INCREASE LITIGATION AS THE OPPOSITION ARGUES RATHER IT IS. IT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE WAY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS TO PURSUE RECOURSE WHEN IT UNFAIRLY TALLY IT AGAINST FOR INVOKING THE RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW. WITH TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TESTIMONY IS CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ FROM CHIRLA AND MEDICAL SO HE HADA WITH. THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FERNANDO. THANK YOU ARE. SENATOR WE HAVE. I BELIEVE TWO WITNESSES- AND ARE THEY BOTH INTENDED TO BE ON THE LINE TALKING REMOTELY YES AND ARE THEY AVAILABLE. AFTER YES HELLO AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS MERRY GO YOSHI HARDEN THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. I'M ARE LAWYERS LIKE MANY OF YOU I'M SURE- ARE HEARING FROM SO MANY WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO FEEL UNSAFE AT WORK BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYERS NOT TAKING PROPER PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THEM FROM BECAUSE THE NINETEEN. AND THE LEGISLATURE IS WORKING ON ANY OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION THAT HELPS STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR OUR ITS CENTRAL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE RIGHT ACTION THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR WORKERS REALLY MEAN NOTHING IF THEY CAN BE FIRED RETALIATED AGAINST FOR TRYING TO A THIRD THOSE RIGHT OR ASK FOR THOSE PROTECTION. THE REALITY OF MANY WORKERS. SPEAK OUT BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR JOB ESPECIALLY IN THIS ECONOMY. I REMEMBER THOSE WORKERS WHO DO SPEAK OUT AND DO FACE RETALIATION SIX MONTHS DOES NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM FILE CLAIMS LABOR. THAT. WILL HELP INSURE THAT THESE WERE DON'T LOSE THEIR- BY GIVING THEM AND SIX. OF THEIR CAR. ON EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WILL. HELP WORKER THE TICKET. LOW WAY. IMMIGRANT WORK TO GET ASSISTANCE. FOR WHAT THE LOWER RETALIATION CLAIM BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW THOSE RECOVERS WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR ATTORNEY. THE NEXT. RIGHT NOW I'M LIKE MOST THE END FEDERAL WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTE THERE IS NO ATTORNEY P. PROVISION WHICH MEANS THE WORKER HALF THE PAY THEIR LEGAL FEES THROUGH A PORTION OF THEIR RECOVERY. OR ELSE FIND AN ATTORNEY TO TAKE THE CASE FOR FREE. I'M AT THE RECENT NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL POINTED OUT ALLOWING WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR ATTORNEY FEES IF THEY PREVAILED DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BECAUSE OF COURSE THE LAWYER GET NOTHING I'M NOT THEY WENT. MICHAEL WILL LOSE ALL THE THEY PUT INTO A INTO WORKING ON A CASE IF THE CLAIM HAS NO MERIT IN REALITY ALLOWING THE RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES REALLY PROVIDES MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BECAUSE LOWER WAGE WORKERS CAN PAY THEIR LEGAL FEES REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY END UP RECOVERY. AND THEIR AWARD WHICH IS OFTEN TIED TO THE WAGES. THIS BILL. WILL HELP INSURE MORE WORKERS ABLE TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LABOR CODE WHICH WE KNOW IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO MANY WORKERS ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES DURING AND THAT MAKE. THE FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE IS. THE SECOND WITNESS AVAILABLE AND I AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT RE OF. THE RULES WE ARE GIVING THREE MINUTES TO EACH SIDE THAT WAS TWO MINUTES SO IF WE HAVE A WITH US THE- OTHER WITNESS MISTER SANCHEZ.

BOB IS A RECEIVED REPORTS OF WORKERS WHOSE WRITING DID COMPROMISED AND PLAYERS A MENU BUT THEY WORKING ON IT CONDITION THE STORES ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES WE WERE PART OF THE PANDEMIC THE ONLY DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE WORK FORCE OF THE CREATES A REPORTS RETALIATION AND OTHER EMPLOYER BECAUSE I MEAN CREWS. ARE FOR TO THE WORKING WITH WHO ARE WORKERS- NOTE WE KNOW THAT OUR SIX MONTH IS NOT ENOUGH AND A YEAR WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE A LOT MORE BENEFICIAL TO IMMIGRANT WORKERS ESPECIALLY TO COME FORWARD ARMS TO TRUSTED SOURCES.

I WILL NOT BELABOR THE POINT WE'VE HAD THAT OPPOSED TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS BILL IN RECENT YEARS AND TO BE BRIEF WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO INCREASE IN THE STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR SUCH CLAIMS. BUT WE CONTINUE TO BE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT CREATES A ONE SIDED ATTORNEY FEE PROVISION OF THESE CLAIMS ARE FILED IN COURT- UNLIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL WE DO THINK THIS INCENTIVE WILL DRIVE MORE CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN COURT WHICH IS MORE COSTLY AN ADVERSARIAL. IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PROCESS AND RAISES THE COSTS FOR ALL SIDES FOR THESE REASONS RECOUP WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL AND ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON A. B. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU.

I HAVE A BROTHER LIVES IN Q. AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT SO- NOW WE WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO DISCUSSION OF WITHIN THE DYE IS HERE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND- I BELIEVE A SENATOR BORCHERS SHE WANTED TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'D LIKE TO ALSO- EXPRESS A HEARTY- CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR NEWEST MEMBER- SENT FORMER ASSEMBLY WOMAN MELINDA'S NOW SENATOR MELINDA'S TO OUR FIND COMMITTEE. I HAVE A QUESTION AND I'M NOT CERTAIN TO WHOM I SUPPOSE IT IS. IT'S. IF A PARTY INITIATES SUIT OR A GRIEVANCE ON TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. CAN AT THAT- GRIEVANCE BE WITHDRAWN IF THE PARTIES SETTLED THE MATTER OUTSIDE OF THE COMMISSION SETTING. TWO WE ED IT MADAM PRESENTER FOOD LIKE TO SPEAK OR WE DO HAVE TO I BELIEVE THE TO- WITNESSES EXPERTS ON THE LINE WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION THE STANDARD ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE. SORRY. TO HAVE MR OFF. YES MERRY GO MERRY WHICH USED MY UNDER IS YEAH AND IF THE IF THE MATTER IS SETTLED THAT BIN AND THEN IT WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S PROCESS TO A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT'S REACHED- COULD CRITICIZE TO ASIAN WHERE THE GRIEVANCES WITHDRAWN FROM THE LABOR COMMISSION. THAT'S CORRECT. MY UNDERSTANDING THE REASON THE REASON WHY I ASK AUTO BUT IT. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. I KNOW GO AHEAD. THE REASON WHY I ASK IS IN THE COURSE OF BUSINESS I THINK WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. AND I WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE FOLKS THAT DON'T THINK THAT PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS FOR CONSUMER ATTORNEYS WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. IS THAT IF IT'S THE CASE THE ATTORNEYS FEES COULD BE COLLECTED AND IT IS A ONE SIDED- AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE LEARNED IN LAW SCHOOL THE BRITISH RULE AND- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. THE BRITISH RULE IS THAT THE PREVAILING PARTY IS ABLE TO COLLECT NOT JUST. ON ONE SIDE A SITUATION LIKE THIS SO I THINK IN TERMS OF EQUITY I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE AN IMBALANCE OF RESOURCES BETWEEN A LOW WAGE EMPLOYEE VERSES EIGHT CORPORATION I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT FOR PURPOSES OF EQUITY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE FOR ATTORNEYS FEES- ON THE TABLE I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT ON THEY DON'T HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXTENSION OF THE- STATURE THE LIMITATIONS THEY HAVE ISSUE WITH THE ATTORNEYS FEES AS TO WHY SO I THINK. IF EQUITY IS GUIDING THIS THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO I'LL- BOTH PARTIES THE ABILITY TO COLLECT BUT HERE'S REALLY WHERE IT'S GONNA GO I SUSPECT. IS THAT. ONE DO WE HAVE A DEFINITE DO WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF THE PREVAILING PARTY IN A CIVIL ACTION. I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT LABOR CIRCUMSTANCE BUT A CIVIL ACTION. IT COULD BE A PARTIAL VICTORY. LAW WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO DECLARE THEMSELVES A PREVAILING PARTY IT COULD BE 51% OF THE ACTIONS OR DETERMINATIONS IN ONES FAVOR- WHATEVER THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT PERTAINS IN A LABOR- CONTEXT OF RETALIATION WHETHER TO ONE DETERMINED OF. JUDGMENT ON THE ISSUE OR THURSDAY ASSEMBLY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD COME ABOUT WITH A PREVAILING DETERMINATION THE PREVAILING PARTY BUT MORE REALISTICALLY. IF WE CAN IF WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE SETTLED BY VIRTUE OF THE ELIGIBILITY FOR- FOR THE FOR THE ELIGIBILITY OF ATTORNEYS FEES. I CAN EASILY SEE. ATTORNEYS RACKING UP RETALIATION ALLEGATIONS AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. EMPLOYER CALCULATING THE COST OF GOING TO TRIAL OR GOING TO A REGULATORY BODY IN DEFENDING ITSELF IN SIMPLY SAYING I WILL OFFER YOU THIS TO WITHDRAW YOUR COMPLAINT. AND THAT I THINK IS A TERRIBLE DISINCENTIVE IN THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE THE CORPORATION OR THE BUSINESS WILL SIPLYLOOK AT THE OVERHEAD OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GO THROUGH A REGULATORY REVIEW WORD MINISTRY TO REVIEW. AND JUST PAY IT OUT SO BY VOLUME YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT ATTORNEYS. ASSEMBLING A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE THIS BEING A CASH COW SO- I THINK I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE FIRST PART OF IT. I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR OR THE PERSON REPRESENTING THE AUTHOR. CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE THE FIRST PART THERE FOR THE EXTENSION. AND WITHDRAW THE ATTORNEY'S FEES PORTION THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE THIS. A BI PARTISAN IN CERTAINLY AN ACCEPTABLE BILL IN MY OPINION THANK YOU CENTER PORCHES BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR MORNING LET ME OBSERVE WE DON'T USE THE BRITISH SYSTEM- AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON WE DON'T WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE. AND IN TERMS OF THE BALANCE OF POWER. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT CORPORATIONS. HAVE MUCH GREATER RESOURCES AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY'S FEES PRISON PREVENTION. MANY PARTICULAR OF OUR LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE NO RESOURCES I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK FOR FREE THESE DAYS. AND WE CERTAINLY PULL THE PLUG ON A LOT OF OUR LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO THAT SO- I THINK THAT TO. YOU'D LIKE TO BRING A BILL PERHAPS PICTURE THAT PUSHED MOVES US INTO THE BRITISH SYSTEM I'M SURE THAT THAT WOULD TO. BE SOMETHING THAT- YOU COULD TO- I THINK THE SYSTEM WE HAVE HERE WORKS WELL AND THESE DIRE PREDICTIONS JUST DON'T EVER SEEM TO HAPPEN- SO. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS MORE FICTIONAL THAN FACT AND- I THINK WE- WE REALLY NEED TO. RECOGNIZE THAT. LAWSUIT AND- THE OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALIZE THE PLAYING FIELD JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAPPEN IF. PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE MOST OF THEM. WITHOUT THE RESOURCES ARE FIGHTING THE GOLIATH OF CORPORATE AMERICA WE'RE MANY OF THEM HAVE STABLES. ALL FOR A- UP ON ON SITE COUNCIL. THE RARE IN TO GO AND VERY HAPPY TO. AND THESE CLAIMS AND OF COURSE IF IT'S A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT AGAINST THROWN OUT AND THERE ARE ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISIONS LET'S NOT FORGET. THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT BALANCE THAT IS CREATED WHEN YOU HAVE A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. LAWYERS GENERALLY WON'T TAKE A CASE UNLESS THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MERIT TO IT BECAUSE THEY WON'T GET PAID. AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PRACTICED LAW- YOU DON'T. WANT TO TAKE THOSE CASES BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY NOT ONLY YOUR TIME THAT IS NOT COMPENSATED BUT OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES AS WELL. AND OF COURSE IF A SETTLEMENT IS REACHED- THE CASE IS RESOLVED AND- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE HAPPEN AND FRANKLY SOME OF US ARE HOPING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO EVEN. UP THE SHOULD BE. COMP WILL COMPLY. AND THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL IN IF YOU HAVE A HEAVY CAMERA THAT'S THE INCENTIVE. OFFER COMPLIANCE AND CHANGED THE WORKING WELL SO WITH THAT SENATOR MONNING. I JUST WANTED ALSO MY WELCOMING. MELINDA'S TO THE COMMITTEE WELCOME- THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO HAMMER OUT ALL KINDS OF EXCITING LEGAL ISSUES IF YOU WANT A LAWYER COMING IN YOU'LL BE A- LAWYER LEAVING- FOR BETTER OR WORSE IN A- COUPLE OF COMMENTS THE CHAIR ADDRESS SOME OF THIS. IT'S MY EXPERIENCE THAT IF THERE'S AN OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT BETWEEN AN EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER. PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE CHARGE FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IT'S NEGOTIATED IT'S PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS THAT PREVENTS. THAT BEING A COMPONENT OF A SETTLED CASE. ON THE ATTORNEY'S FEES ISSUE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD LEGISLATION PROPOSED. TO REQUIRE- LOSING. PLAINTIFF WHO ALLEGES RETALIATION HAVE TO SHOULDER ATTORNEYS FEES AND THAT'S NEVER MADE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND IN TWO. WELL YOU CAN LOOK AT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE LEGISLATURE OR YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EQUITY QUESTION OF WHAT ARE WE TO PUTS THE PUBLIC POLICY. OF ANALYZING AN EMPLOYER WHO RETALIATES ILLEGALLY AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. WHO COMPLAINS THAT SAY ABOUT AN UNSAFE WORKING CONDITION. BUT SAY WORKING CONDITION THAT COULD COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL OTHER WORKERS. A WORKER BRINGS THAT TO THE ATTENTION OF AUTHORITIES. AND IS TERMINATED FOR THAT. IF THERE'S THE THREAT OF HAVING TO SHOULDER. EXTRAORDINARY ATTORNEY'S FEES IF YOU DON'T PREVAIL. IN THAT CASE. EIGHT THE PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT IS A CHILLING IMPACT ON BRINGING TO THE. FOR REPORTS EXERCISING EXISTING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WHETHER THAT'S TO CAL OSHA OR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ON WAGE CLAIMS THAT CENTURY SO THE PUBLIC POLICY DIVIDE IN IN WHAT MAY LOOK LIKE AN IMBALANCE OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR ATTORNEYS FEES IT THAT THAT IMBALANCE IN APPEARANCE IS BALANCED TERMS OF THE PUBLIC POLICY ENCOURAGED YOU DON'T WANNA CHILL AFFECT ON SOME MISSING. SOME THAT BUT IF CLEAN IN PURSUE A CASE AND DON'T PREVAIL MY FAMILY I'M WORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE ATTORNEY'S FEES. OF A CORPORATION- SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S- UNNECESSARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHO'S ELIGIBLE ON AND IS THIS BILL BOTH EXTENDS A STATUE LIMITATIONS AND REAFFIRMS THAT PRINCIPLE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IN MADAME SHARED LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. VERY GOOD- CENTER I CAL SKI. AND HIGH I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HAND UP SENATOR STERN CHOICE IN WHAT YOU'RE GOOD BUT WILL END WITH THE OBSERVATION BY CENTER Y. CASKEY I'M ON PAGE SIX OF THE STAFF AND ALL SUS UNDER PRE EXISTING CLAIMS THE AUTHOR AGREES WITH THE- THE FLAPS. ARE CLAIMS THAT THERE'S NO REVIVAL SINCE THE BILL SIMON ON IT JUST. DOUBLE CHECKING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME CENTER MELENDEZ TO THE COMMITTEE ALSO. HE SAID I SING THAT THAT'S- THE ANALYSIS THEY HAVE IN YEARS. I'M SURE WOULD YOU REPEAT THAT GET THE HIT THEY TALK ABOUT PRE SIXTEEN CLAIMS THAT THERE'S THE BILL SILENT ON ARE REVIVING ANY LAPSE CLAIMS THAT THERE IT'S ONLY GOING FORWARD A PROSPECTIVE CLAIMS THE DO A NICE ANALYSIS OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION ON THIS SO I ASSUME THAT THAT'S- THE AUTHOR AGREES. THERE'S NO TRICKS HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS THE CASE BUT ALL DEFERRED OF MARIE GO AS WELL AS SHE HAS ADDITIONAL OR CHRISTOPHER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT BUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET CONFIRMATION- ARE ONE OF THE TWO OF YOU MISS- MISTER LET'S SEE I HAVE CHRISTOPHER AMERICAL I APOLOGIZE I DON'T LAST NAMES ARE. NOT AS QUICK TO OF TO MY MIND BUT IF EITHER OF YOU- HAS A COMMENT TO CONFIRM OR REJECT THAT I'D APPRECIATE YOUR EXPRESSING THAT TO US. YES FEET THE INTENDED NOT TO REVISE BLOCKED CLAIMS THAT IT'S FOR- EXISTING CLAIM TO EXPAND. THAT THE TIME PERIOD. FOR THOSE EXISTING CLAIM NOT TO REVISE ONES THAT HAVE ALREADY LOCKED. THANK YOU SO EXTINGUISH CLAIMS- REMAIN EXTINGUISHED. VERY GOOD. WHERE WOULD I BE ABLE TO COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY WHO WHO IS THIS IF YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF PLEASE. DYNAMIC ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. IT BRIEFLY PLEASE THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES I DID WANT TO POINT OUT ASSEMBLY BILL LINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACE LAST YEAR WHICH EXTENDED THE STRUCTURE LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS EXPLICITLY PROVIDEDTHAT IT DID NOT REVIVED LAPSED CLAIMS SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT STATUTE AND MORE CLEAR IF THAT'S THE INTENT TO EXPLICITLY PROVIDE SO IN THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR- CONSULTANT WITH US IN THE ROOM TO RAISE THAT ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY WE WILL. HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ALONG THAT LINE WITHOUT ANY PROMISES JUST CAN'T DO. OUR THE TO HAVE THAT ONE ON ONE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WAS THE INTENT AND- IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO TAKE FURTHER CLARIFICATION THAT CERTAINLY- WOULD MAKE SENSE- BUT WE ARE NOW THIS BILL IS BEEN MOVED AGAIN THE MOTION. IS TO PASS. A TO APPROPRIATIONS BEFORE THAT DID YOU WISH TO SAY SOMETHING I DID- MANAGER I APOLOGIZE BUT- CHRISTOPHER AND MARIE CAL IS IT. COULD YOU REPEAT FOR ME- WHO THEY REPRESENT I DIDN'T CATCH IT AT THE BEGINNING I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS PROVIDING ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL WE HAVE. WITH US- FASTER FOR SANCHEZ POLICY ADVOCATE WITH CHIRLA AND THEN MERRY GO YOSHIHARA. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OKAY SO THEY- THEY DON'T REPRESENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT OUR SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND DO THEY. ARE THEY JUST HERE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE THEY SPONSORS I BELIEVE THEY'RE ALSO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND YOU WILL YOU WILL FIND IT BOTH OF THEM. WHITE REGULARLY THE EMPLOYMENT LAW LAW. OF FOLKS AS WELL AS A CHIRLA- ARE VERY ACTIVE PARTICIPATE BUT THEY CERTAINLY SOUND LIKE- AND THEIR WELL VERSED ON THE SUBJECT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE AUTHOR IS IN HERE I'M NOT SURE WHY THE ARTERIES IN HERE AND SO. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE OUTSIDE FOLKS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM KALRA IS BILL. WELL IT'S NOT JUST THAT UNCOMMON TO HAVE EXPERTS WHO ARE ABLE TO GIVE US FURTHER ASSISTANCE- SO. I THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE FURTHER TESTIMONY I KNOW THAT THE- RICO HAD A DOES A NUMBER. OF ANALYSES AND EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF. THE EMPLOYMENT LAW SECTION OF THE BAR AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY WERE IN THE TRENCHES THERE CONTROL IS ALSO VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED. AND I WILL INDICATE TO THAT ONE OF THE COURTESIES THAT HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND I THINK HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO BOTH HOUSES. IS IN ORDER TO KEEP AS FEW PEOPLE IN A CONFINED SPACE AS POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE OFFERING AND THE ASSEMBLY IS ALSO REST RECIPROCATING AND OFFERING THERE. ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO PRESENT BILLS ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHORS. UNUSUAL COUNTING BUT THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE'RE DOING SO WITH THAT THERE IS A MOTION TO PASS TO ASSEMBLY TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ON THIS MEASURE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND I'M CHAIR JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY- I THINK ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA I THINK THE WITNESSES AND I ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU WITH THAT- MATTER IN CONSULTANT WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IF THE SENATORS COULD PLEASE TURN YOUR MICROPHONES ON. THIS IS FILE ITEM TO A. B. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN KALRA.

THIS BILL IS THE ONGOING WORK PRODUCT OF LITERALLY YEARS OF EFFORT BY MY OFFICE TO UPDATE CALIFORNIA LAW FOR THE NEW REALITY OF ONLINE CHARITABLE SOLICITATION. AND STAKEHOLDER NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN LED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT BEGAN LAST FALL. OUR STATE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE TURNED TO INTERNET TO THE INTERNET TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO LOCAL CHARITIES. THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS TO GIVE ONLINE INCLUDING DIRECTLY TO A CHARITY AND INDIRECTLY TO VARIOUS CHARITIES THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT LIST ALL CHARITIES REGISTERED WITH THE IRS. THE BENEFITS AND EFFICIENCIES OF TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING CALIFORNIANS TO DONATE TO VIRTUALLY ANY CHARITY DO NOT FIT EASILY WITHIN THE CURRENT LETTER OF THE LAW. AT WHICH NEVER CONTEMPLATED A PERSON OR COMPANY WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SOLICIT FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PARTNER CHARITIES. AB TWENTY TWO AWAY WILL ALLOW FOR CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING PLATFORMS TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY CHARITY.

THE CURRENT SOLICITATION WHICH WERE ADOPTED BEFORE THE INTERNET AGE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY REACH SHOULD BE ABLE PLATFORM. TO ENSURE THAT. CHARITABLE THE PROVISIONAL IS OUT DAY. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE AGING CONTINUED ABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC OUR OFFICE NEEDS TO BE IN A POSITION TO OVERSEE CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING PRACTICES. THAT OCCUR INTERNET PLATFORMS AND FIND NIMBLY TO NEW CONCERNS WHATEVER THEY ARRIVE. AS POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN TIME OF NATURAL DISASTER WE SEE AN INCREASE ONLINE SHOWING RAISING. THE COVE IN NINETEEN CRISIS IS NO DIFFERENT.

GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBER SEVEN A MAJOR ATTACK NOT WE SHOULD AUTHORS GOLD TRANSPARENCY AS IT RELATES TO GENERAL FUND RAISING AND DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE WORK ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND OUR STAFF HAS DONE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE BUT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER NINE MONTHS OF CONVERSATIONS AND STAKEHOLDER MEETING. TECH THAT REMAINS OPPOSING LAST MINUTE ON AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT. I MEMBER COMPANIES WORK WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO RAISING PROCESS BILLION DOLLARS IN DONATIONS FOR NONPROFIT. NOW MORE THAN EVER THIS IS GOING EXPECT HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE COKE WITH NINETEEN CRISIS. AND THE REASON CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WHEN NONPROFIT TO RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT THOSE AND FROM MIND AND LOCAL COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SUCCESSFUL FUNDRAISING EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN REALIZED TO OUR PLATFORMS. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE HAVE PROPOSES HERE'S AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR THAT WOULD. HELP REMEDY THE TENANTS OF THOSE LEGISLATION WITH THE REALITIES OF OUR CURRENT CHARITABLE PRACTICES. FIRST IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE PROVIDED TIME TO ADAPT TO NEW STATUTORY AND STILL UNKNOWN REGULATORY SCHEMES CONTEMPLATED IT AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT. FOR THIS REASON WE THINK A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR BUSINESSES TO MODIFY. THEIR CURRENT PROSTHESES. IN ORDER TO BE. WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL AND CHAIRED GIVING PROCESS. SECOND WE REQUEST A LITTLE. RECIPIENTS AND STAND AT THE IN THIS. SHOULD BE MORE. OF NON. CHARITY INCLUDING THOSE OUT OF THE UNIED STATES THEY MAY NOT BE. BY THE ARE OR AT THESE WERE. THIRD TECH THAT REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BROAD STATUTE STATUTORY AT THE DEFERRED AN AGING OFFICE FOR. RULEMAKING THE BILL AS MANY PRESCRIPTIVE COMPONENTS CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE LANGUAGE THE BILL ALSO MAKES SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE THE AG TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE. THE STATUTORY PARAMETERS OF THIS BILL ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE OPEN IN THE NATURE OF WHAT INFORMATION WOULD BE REQUIRED AND ALL TOWARDS THE AG'S OFFICE. WHICH WOULD BE RESOLVED IN STATUTE BUT WHICH COULD BE RESULT AND CATCH YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT THE BILL. WITH AG IS GIVEN AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH SHALL INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO. THE ADDITIONAL. ACTION SOLICITATION THAT MEET. HAVE A CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING CLASS FORMER PLATFORMS. TO JESSE CHANGES IN TECH. IN CLASS FUNDRAISING CLOUT FOR. WE BELIEVE FEATURES AND ARE BETTER OFF. AND WILL DO. BY ABILITY OUT THAN WHAT THE DOJ. THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE BILL CAN OF AND GIVING OPEN OVER PLATFORM AND FORCED A TO RE EVALUATE THE VIABILITY FOR SIX. CHARITABLE STRAW. FOR THESE REASONS AND OUTLINE INNER CITY IN AND TECHNO REMAINS IN BECAUSE I'M NOT AMENITIES LOOKS TO THE- PREDICTED CONVERSATION WITH YA THANK YOU.

SURE SAME CONCERNS PARTICULARLY THAT THE BILL WOULD GRANT PRETTY PROUD REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BE ADDRESSED- IN STATURE- JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES- THAT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS FLAGS- RELATED TO THE- BILL'S COULD STAND REQUIREMENTS. WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS- ALONE FOR A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS IN GOOD STANDING THREE MACHINE READABLE WOULD BE HELPFUL TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS- AND MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL- IN- THE BILL'S REQUIRE. PLACE BURDENS ON. HUNDRED AND PLATFORMS COULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED. OF A REDUCE INSURABLE GIVEN SO HELPING READERS SOME OF THOSE BURDENS- AND ALLOW FOR AUTOMATION WOULD BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL- I. SIR OVER AND MY APOLOGIES FOR WE ARE TO KEEP THIS TO THE MINUTES I'M SURE THERE BE SOME QUESTIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO- FURTHER COMMENT BUT AT THIS POINT- WE ARE TRYING TO STICK TO THE THREE MINUTE GOLAN WE WENT A LITTLE BIT OVER. AND MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT- ALL RIGHT WHAT. WE NEED TO DO NOW IS TO ASK IF THERE ARE ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WOULD LIKE TO. SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WITH THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL. SEEING NONE ROOM TWENTY FORTY IS THERE ANYONE IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY SEEING NONE.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MADAM MODERATOR. I HAVE NO FURTHER LINES IN Q. AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THE WE WILL THEN BRING THIS BACK TO DISCUSSION- ALONG THE MEMBERS AND I BELIEVE CENTER BORCHERS FALL BY CENTER Y. CASKEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THINK A ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR ONE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THERE ARE SOME REALLY. IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. ON I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THAT. WHEN PEOPLE ARE DRAWN EITHER THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA OR ODD THROUGH OTHER TECH MEANS- TO SUPPORT A CAUSE- IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS DONATE DOLLARS TO THIS BECAUSE USING A PLATFORM. IT'S A SITUATION WHERE THINGS CAN GO AWRY MEANING THAT THE PLATFORM OR THE FOLKS THAT ARE OPERATING AT A OR SUBMITTING THE MESSAGE TO THE VIEWER CAN MISLEAD THE VIEWER- IN ALL USING EXAMPLE- THERE WAS A- THERE WAS A FOREIGN ENTITY- ASKING FOR DONATIONS TO SUPPORT TO SUPPORT THAT REFUGEES. AND IT WAS LATER REVEALED THAT IT WAS TO A TOTALLY UNRELATED- ENTITY THAT USE THAT PLATFORM TO BY PASS AND GIVE THE DOLLARS ON TO ANOTHER PURPOSE THAT SOME WITH THE THAT SCHIST FRAUD BUT I THINK T'S RIPE THAT STUFF LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN- I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT. EVEN WITH THIS GOOD IDEA THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT. STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE RECOMMENDING THE THIS. MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME AMENDMENTS AND MORE DISCUSSION AND I KINDA GETS TO MY LAST POINT IS- I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORTER VERSION OF THIS BILL AT SOME POINT IN TIME I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT. FULLY DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT I THINK IT COULD BE. AND I'M KIND OF CONCERNED THAT. HOW THIS FITS IN WITH OUR OVERALL- APPRECIATION OF BILLS THAT SHOULD BE HEARD IN OUR TRUNCATED- TIMELINE IT'S NOT COLLUDED RELATED. IT'S NOT TIME SENSITIVE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY VETTED SO I DON'T KNOW WHY. THIS WAS ELIGIBLE AND SHOULDN'T BE BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY. MAYBE ALL THE FOR MY QUESTION TO CHAIR WOMAN TO EXPLAIN HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE COVERT SESSION IS AN IMPERFECT SCIENCE. THAT THAT'S MY RESPONSE SENATOR WHY CAL SKI. WELL I'M GLAD I'M GLAD THAT THAT'S NO CLEAR THE AIR. THAT IT'S NOT BASED ON THE LETTER IN THE MAIL THAT WAS PER. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HERE WE'RE HERE WITH THE HEARING WE'VE GOT A BILL BEFORE US- AND- SENATOR WHERE CASKEY IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED PLEASE FEEL FREE. FROM THE OPPOSITE IN ABOUT NO GUIDANCE IN CERTAIN- AREAS ABOUT THE H. E. L. AT ISSUE IN THESE REGULATIONS TAKEN FROM ON THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE GUIDANCE ON PAGE TEN OF OUR ANALYSIS TO TALK ABOUT DO REGISTRATION FOR COMMERCIAL CHARITIES. I WANT TO KNOW IF- IS THE SUGGESTION THAT MAYBE. THE EIGHT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MAYBE DEPUTY LIEU ONCE ANSWER THIS FOR THE AUTHORS AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES HAVE THE- OPTION TO EXEMPT PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY. REPORTING REGISTERED AND LIKE WHAT IS HE AUTHORS THOUGHTS ON THAT. I'D I WOULD I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO SAY IS YOU KNOW THANK YOU AGAIN FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THIS BILL AND IT IS VERY RELEVANT TO COUPLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS COMING INTO THE ONLINE PLATFORMS IS. ABSOLUTELY EXPLODING AND IN SOME WAYS ONLINE GIVING IS THE WILD WEST SO I WOULD LIKE TO THE- THAT. THEN SENATOR JACKSON'S ABOUT OF AND REALLY GETTING DOWN INTO THE WEEDS ON THIS BILL AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY A HARD BALANCING ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP OUR SPONSOR- WHO IS REALLY LEADING THE DISCUSSIONS IN SUPPORT TO KEEP CAL NON PROFITS IN SUPPORT AND REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS ALSO THE ISSUES OF TECH THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BUT WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY GOING TO REDUCE CONSUMER PROTECTION WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT SO. ON YOUR SPECIFIC. QUESTION I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER THAT THE SPOT OF ANSWER THE SO I EITHER MISTER LOW OR MISTER ARMSTRONG I'M SURE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT TO REGISTRY LET'S GO AHEAD. MISSION WHEN I IS THE PERSON YOU'RE TO GET. BOB TO YOU DO THAT MR HOFFMAN FISH ON THE CALL FOR YOUR YOU'LL SIGN THIS IS HAPPENING I THINK YOU ARE. AND I THINK BRIAN WILL TRY ABOUT COULD SORRY MIGHT BE FACIAL. ALL RIGHT SO WE DO HAVE ON THE CALL. TRYING TO FLEE THROUGH ALL OF THE NOTES IS THAT RIGHT CHALLENGE WE DO HAVE LET ME IT THIS WAY WE HAVE AG ON THE CALL WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. SURE YOUR HONOR THIS IS THIS IS BRIAN ARMSTRONG. LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE CONCEPT OF A TOOL REGISTRATION AND HOW IT'S REALLY NOT A PROBLEM- ESSENTIALLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NEEDS TO KNOW WHO'S DOING WHAT FOR INSTANCE TWO BUTTONS AT THE WALL. THAT THE FIRM IS PLAYING WHEN THEY'RE SOLICITING DONATIONS POLLUTION HALF THE GAS. AND FIGURE THAT OUT- AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF REGISTRATION CATEGORY IF THERE'S ONE CALLED THE TREE HE IS A CENTURY ASKS ARE. OLD CHARITABLE ASSET. THERE'S A WEDGE AND WHAT WILL FOR THAT THAT FOCUSED ON FOR INSTANCE CHAIRED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE PROVIDING INFORMATION ALONG THE LINES OF FLAKE OUT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT THAT YOU'LL SEE FROM AN AUDITOR IT REALLY INVOLVES FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF BEING A CHARITY- MEANWHILE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS- BUT THE BILL- ENVISIONED AS A CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING PLATFORM. IS VERY WELL MAY NOT BE AN ACTUAL CHARITY AT ALL ALTHOUGH IN SOME CASES THE COULD BE. AND THIS IS AN AND IN THE OPTIONAL ROLE THAT IF IT IS A CHARITY BUT IT MAY TAKE ON AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING ON THE ROLE OF FUND RAISING FOR OTHER CHARITY. SO WE NEED TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE WHO IS SERVING IN THAT ROLE OUR CAPACITY OF A CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING TOP FORM. SO WE CAN SUPERVISE FACILITATION FOR POSSIBLE WRONGDOING. IN THIS BAG FOR AN ADDITIONAL REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN LEARN THAT FOR AN ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PUBLIC SPECIFIC TO THE ONLINE. SOLICITATION WHAT PORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT GO WITH REGISTRATION WOULD BE SPECIFIC ALSO TO THE ONLINE FLIRTATIONS SO THERE WOULDN'T BE DUPLICATION AND REPORTING AND NOT CARD. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TODAY THAT THERE IS A DUAL REGISTRATION AS A RELATES TO THESE TYPES OF TRUSTEES TODAY. OR NOT IT'S WHEN THEY PERFORM RAFFLES WHICH IS THE TYPE OF THE LEGAL FORM OF GAMBLING AND WHEN A CHARITY PERFORMS ARRIVAL THEY NEED TO REGISTER IN ADVANCE BEFORE PERFORMING THE RAFFLES AND PROVIDE- SEPARATE REPORTING ON THAT AS WELL- YOU KNOW THAT. THIS IS WORKED OUT FINE AND THE CAPACITY OF RAFFLES LIKE THAT. I'M. AND WE WE'RE NOT SEEING THE CONCERN THAT. IT MAY HAVE. THE DOOR REGISTRATION. THE THAT'S IT YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU DESERVE TO YEAH I THINK SO I EIGHTH. WE'RE WE'RE SAYING THAT THE POLL ON THE- THAT MAY PRESENT AS A CHARITABLE PLATFORM BUT BUT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL- TRUST IN THE CHURCH ORGANIZATION AND IF THERE'S DIFFERENCES THERE THEN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SKIP THOSE PEOPLE IN AND THE BILL. OKAY SO THE GET AN AGING THIS COULD I COME JUST MAKE ONE THE VERY BRIEFLY SIR. SURE THAT OF WE ARE. REVIEWING AMEND UNDERLYING THAT WE'RE MADE. TO THE COMMITTEE ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO. DISCUSSING AND- WORK THROUGH THE THINGS OF THE NEXT DAYS I THINK AS A GENERAL MATTER. YOU HOW ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED UNDER THIS LAW AS DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT THE COMMERCIAL COVENTRY AS A- COMMERCIAL FRIENDLY MADE. AND CONDUCT THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS OF COURSE THE INTERNET FUND RAISING ON THE PLATFORM SO IF YOU'RE AN EXISTING ORGANIZATION ALREADY REGISTERED AT THE END AND YOU ELECT TO. THE KIND. OF CONDUCT FALLS UNDER THE BUILD BUT NAKHTMIN ISSUE VYING. SHOULD THERE BE SEPARATE REGISTRATION. AND IN ORDER TO. FACILITATE OVERSIGHT OVER PLATFORM TYPE OF CONDUCT OR SHOULD USE SIMPLY BE ALLOWED TO ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF CONDUCT. AND MAINTAIN YOUR PREVIOUS REGISTRATION OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENTITY. WHICH WAS REQUIRED OF YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR DIFFERENT SET OF CONDUCT. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK THE AUTHOR ADDRESS THIS BUT I WOULD JUST AMPLIFY THE NEXUS WITH COVERT NINETEEN TO ME IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THIS WEEK TOMORROW THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST THEIR JOBS THROUGH NO CHOICE OF THEIR OWN EXPIRES NO BACK UP COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE GONNA PEOPLE FACING. FICTION THE INABILITY TO PAY RENT AND ABILITY TO PAY THEIR- FEED THEIR FAMILIES TO PUT GAS IN THEIR CARS. WERE GOING FROM CRISIS TO SUPER CRISIS AND- IN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED ARE GONNA BE MORE DEPENDENT ON CHARITABLE GIVING THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN CHARITABLE APPEALS. MANNING HOPEFULLY MOST WILL BE LEGITIMATE SOME WILL BE CON ARTISTS WHO ARE GONNA PLAY UP ON PEOPLE'S SYMPATHY AND CONCERN FOR OTHER DISPLACED IN WITH. SUPPORT IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS SO. I DON'T THINK IT'S A STRETCH TO SEE THIS BILL IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRIORITIZATION OF COVERT NINETEEN AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO MY RESPONSE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CLIP THIS IS VERY DEFINITELY COVERED RELATED DIRECTLY WERE A COUPLE BILLS. THAT WE CONSIDERED TO HEAR DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE OF CHARITABLE GIVING AND THE MINUTE. SADLY THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE AUNT OF WELL MEANING IN INTEREST WHO WOULD TO HELP THOSE. NEED THIS BILL ACT. UP AS FAR THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO AMENDMENTS SHOULD'VE TO. WITH ATTORNEY OFFICE IS SORT OF THE OF IT FIND WE HAVE AN ONLINE. EMPIRE OF THE- IS THAT. THEY'RE VERY PLATFORM OUT THERE THAT ARE- WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OR APPROVAL OF THE ACTUAL CHARITY THAT IS BEING REPRESENTED CLAIMING THAT THEY ARE IN FACT RAISING MONEY FOR THEIR CHARITY AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN THEY SHOULD FALL WITH THE PER OF THE- GENERAL WHO. CONTROL CHAIRED GIVING SO WITH THE- INTRODUCTION AND IN FACT MEANT OF INTERNET TRANSACTIONS IN THIS WAY THERE IS REALLY BEEN INADEQUATE PROTECTIONS. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GIVE ONLINE FOR THOSE CHARITIES AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL. IS AND A DESIGNS TO REGULATE SO. AGAIN THE CURRENT PROVISIONS ARE REGULATE MORE CHARTER A MORE TRADITIONAL SOLICITATIONS AND IT HASN'T BEEN MODERNIZED- PARTICULARLY AT THIS POINT TIME. WHERE WE'RE SEEING- THE GENEROSITY OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PEOPLE'S COUNTRY COMING FORWARD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR GIFTS TO THOSE IN NEED GOAL TO THOSE PEOPLE IN NEED AND- UNFORTUNATELY. WE HAVE WITH THIS CRISIS AS WE SEE WITH EVERY CRISIS THERE ARE THOSE OUT THERE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CROP FOR THE PHONE. UP OFTEN. THREE SHELF AND GREED DROVE DOES AND THIS IS A MEASURE THAT TRIES TO PUT A CHECK ON THAT AND FRANKLY THAT'S THE REASON THAT I WAS- WANTING AN ANXIOUS TO HEAR THIS BILL BECAUSE I DO THINK IT WILL MOVE US FORWARD I IN THAT PROTECT. THE ARE ON GOAL. DISCUSSIONS I KNOW THAT MANY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND I THINK ARE THERE ARE STILL. DISCUSSIONS GOING ON. BUT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME IN ALL CANDOR WE ARE SEEING.

THERE ARE NO LINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT. OF DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HI I DID I ASK SYSTEM FORTY TWO A THREE YEAR TWENTY FORTY ALL RIGHT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK THEN TO THE DíAS AND SENATOR MELINDA'S THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. LET'S ASSUME IT IS- A MOTHER WHO HAS HE'S TAKING CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSE OR EX SPOUSES INCARCERATED. SO IF THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS STOP. THEN OUT WHAT IS THE MOTHER TO DO TO. ME IN A SUPPLEMENT THE INCOME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVING AS CHILD SUPPORT. THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION SENATOR- ONE THING THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN A PARENT IS INCARCERATED IS THAT THEY MAKE ABOUT EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. ON TOP OF THAT THE STATE TAKE THE MANDATORY HOUR. SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT A PARENT THAT IS INCARCERATED CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE FEES AND PENALTIES THE ONE THAT PARENTS RELEASED FROM PRISON. A HOT. THEY HAVE A DEBT. THAT THEY ARE. OFTEN NOT ABLE TO GET OUT OF I'M SORRY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO EXPLAIN BUT IF YOU COULD JUST. YOU KNOW ANSWER THIS QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT IS THE- THOSE MOTHER WHO'S TAKING CARE TO CHILDREN SUPPOSED HOW WOULD HOW DOES SHE SUPPLEMENT. THAT LIKE HIM I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRO. VISIT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SALARY COMING IN WELL YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION THAT. THE ANSWER IS IN FRONT OF YOU SENATOR. A MOTHER THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CHILD SUPPORT FROM PARENTS THAT IF INCARCERATED IS GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK FOR OTHER RESOURCES. AND LUCKILY WE LIVE IN A STATE THAT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT CUTTING THEM. AMID CODED AND A MAN OF VERY LITTLE. RECESSION SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE POINT. THAT PROGRAM PROVIDE. FOOD HEALTHCARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS NEED ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE AND I HOPE WE CAN COUNT YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT AND I AND IF I MAY JUST JUMP IN WE ASKED YOU YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT. IN THE PLACE THE. HI RUNNING. WORST TO PEOPLE CARS RATED YOU TO HAVE TO PAY YEARS. AND OBVIOUSLY AGENTS AN HOUR THERE GOING TO BE A TO. WELL WHAT ABOUT THE- PARENT. WHO THEN AND- EVEN RISK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ALSO GIVE CONSIDERATION TO THAT FACT WELL AND THAT'S WHAT THE STUDY. WILL LOOK AT WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE- BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ULTIMATELY WILL SUFFER- IF THERE IS NO SUCH. COMING IN- AT WHAT WERE YOU FREQUENTLY FIND COOLEY IS IT'S USUALLY CUSTODIAL OTHER. AND ENDS UP TAKING A SECOND JOB NO TAKING A THIRD JOB- SO THE BURDEN DAN. RETURNS TO THAT COULD STILL BE A PARENT WHICH OF COURSE WHEN PARENTS ARE NOT IN THE HOME ABLE TO DO THE NECESSARY THE DISCIPLINE AND OVERSIGHT OF CHILDREN. A CREATES A REAL PROBLEM AND THEN OF COURSE IF THERE'S NO FOOD ON THE TABLE SO. THIS BILL AT AT MY REQUEST FRANKLY. OF THE AUTHOR GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO ACCEPT. THAT AMENDMENT SO WE CAN START LOOKING AT THAT WE HAD ANOTHER BILL THAT WE PUT- A DID WAS CONSENT ITEM- BY IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL- THAT ALSO. LIMIT ON A SUPPORT WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW. VETERAN TO WHOSE ONLY GETTING SSI AND OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF RESOURCES. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE CANNOT FORGET. THE PARENT TO INTO POTENTIALLY STUCK WITH THE BILL IF YOU WILL- BUT CLEARLY- IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN PRISON I CANNOT PAY. THEY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AN- ARM I THINK. OUT WITH THIS STUDY WILL BE ABLE TO. GET A BASS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE. PROPERLY CARED FORCE THAT THERE NEEDS ARE NOT UNDERMINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PARENT TO IN MARCH. AND NOT GETTING ANY. I THINK. ANSWERED YES YEAH MA'AM IN A APPRECIATE CLARIFICATION SO I AS A PANDERS IT THEN WE BE IF THE MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO STOP THE IN. FOR SUPPORT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING SHE WOULD THEN HAVE TO GO AND SOME SORT OF- GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHAT YOU WERE. RECOMMENDING OR SUGGESTING AND THE CHAIR SAID THAT YOU HAD AGREED TO PUT A STUDY IN PLACE- THOUGH THE STUDY- CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP THE CUSTODIAL PARENT DURING THE TIME WHEN SHE STILL NEEDS TO FEED HER CHILDREN INCLUDE HER CHILDREN AND ALL THE THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE SO I DON'T KNOW I THINK THIS STUDY MIGHT COME A LITTLE. CONSOLATION TO THE ACTUAL BECAUSE OF TO BE YOU KNOW. SORRY FOR BEING A ABOUT THIS. THE I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION- IT SAYS THIS DOES NOT APPLY WERE THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL HAS THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE MAKING CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS AND THAT- DOES THAT MIRROR FEDERAL LAW. OKAY AND THEN IT ALSO SAYS- IT DOES NOT APPLY. WHERE INCARCERATION IS THE RESULT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR SUPPORTED PARTY OR CHILD IS DOES THAT ALSO MERE FEDERAL LAW OR IS THAT SOMETHING. THAT'S JUST STATE LAW. I'LL HAVE TO THE BY TO YOU ON ONE I BELIEVE IN THEIR STATE LAW BUT LET ME DOUBLE CHECK ON A STEER YOU IN THE WRONG OKAY AND IT'S JUST A MISTAKE VIOLENCE SO NO WEATHER SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THERE WERE ANY SORT OF SEXUAL ABUSE. THAT'S NOT FACTORED INTO THIS LIVE USES FACTORED INTO IT. OKAY IT IS FACTORS OR ANYTHING ELSE FACTORED IN THAT. I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT I DON'T I JUST HAVE A DOMESTIC ABUSE IN FRONT OF ME IS THERE I'M HAPPY TO GET YOUR INFORMATION ON THE BILL. OKAY SIR TO A CASKET FUND. CLEAR THAT THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO DOMESTIC PEOPLE SERVING PRISON TIME FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WOULD APPLY TO THEM DO YOU ENVISION THE STUDY THAT YOU AGREE TO WITH THAT GIVE US REPORT ON THE IMPACT THAT. ALLOWING THE DEBT BURDEN TO CONTINUE ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MONTHS SAID AND THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WHAT THAT IMPACT MAY HAVE WANTS TO RELEASE FOR PAYING CHILD SUPPORT. FINDING A JOB DOING ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS I DON'T KNOW ITS ACT READ THE AMENDMENT BUT IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT IT'S ASKING FOR THOSE IMPACTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS. DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN THE CHAIR WELL THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAS ALREADY BEEN RESEARCH ON THAT. AND THE RICHARD RESEARCH DOES SHOW- THAT MOST OF THE CHILD SUPPORT THAT COMES FROM PARENTS MAKING LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT- WHAT WE'VE DONE NOW IS THERE ON TOP OF THE REAR RIDGE IS A 10% INTEREST PENALTY. SO OF THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN A PERSON COMES OUT OF PRISON. GET BACK ON THEIR FEET THEY ARE THEY PERCEIVE THAT THEY ARE IN SUCH ENORMOUS DEBT. THAT FREQUENTLY THEY WON'T THAT DAY. DISASSOCIATE FROM ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CHILDREN THAT'S FINANCIALLY BASED THE ROOM BARROW STORE THERE ARE DATE THEY FEEL INADEQUATE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES AND THAT- THEY DON'T REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILY SO WOULD IT APPARENTLY INCREASES RECIDIVISM. ME TO IT'S A LOSE LOSE SITUATION I MEAN I SEE THAT WERE YOU KNOW WE'RE EXCLUDING THE ROBBERS MORE EXCLUDING THE TRUCK DRIVERS AT TO TIME BUT WE'RE NOT EXCLUDING THE PEOPLE OVER. SAID THERE CAN BEEN CONVICTED OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I'M JUST THINKING THAT. DAY THE POLICY GOALS FOR THE GOALS WE STAYED OF FREE REUNIFICATION AND MAKING SURE THAT ONCE THEY'RE OUT. THEIR BEHAVIORS IMPROVE THAT THEY PAY WHATEVER THE AMOUNT WAS JUST WONDERFUL SHOULD BE STARTING THAT ALSO. OKAY THEIR DATE THE BE CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BE IN POVERTY BE POOR UPPER PER PERSON AND FALL INTO ALL THE OTHER CATEGORIES EXCEPT FOR THE CRIME THAT THEY WERE. INCARCERATED FOR AND JUST SEEMS. I DON'T KNOW. SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO STUDY TO SEE. MAYBE IS THAT IS THAT HELPFUL OR HARMFUL. MAY I RESPOND IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED THE RESPONSE CERTAINLY SO LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR ON THE INTENT OF THE BILL THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO BRING CALIFORNIA UP TO A FEDERAL STANDARD IT IS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CARS. AND ADDITIONALLY. SUPPORT PAYMENTS THE DAY CURRENTLY CA MEET BECAUSE THEY ARE IN CARS AND MAKING EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU ON YOUR CELL SENATOR AND ANYONE IN THIS ROOM TO TRY TO DO ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON HOW TO HELP PEOPLE. GET BACK ON THEIR FEET DECREASE RECIDIVISM RATES. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES. PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS I WANT TO. BUY YOUR REQUEST MADAM CHAIR KEEP THE SHORT BUT WE COULD GET INTO IT. WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN BOTH HOUSES FROM BOTH PARTIES. IS AN AGREED IS IMPLICIT BIAS. PARENTS ARE INCARCERATED THE REALITY IS THE MAJORITY OF PARENTS WANT TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF THEIR CHILD'S LIFE. BUT THE BURDENS THAT THEY ENCOUNTER ALONG THE WAY ARE SO HIGH. THEY'RE COMING OUT OF PRISON DURING PULLED IT. NO JOBS LACK OF HOUSING AN INCREDIBLY REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY. WHO HAVE CLEARLY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND WANTS TO RENO TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT THEIR KIDS CAN DO SO FOR LET'S TAKE CARE OF THAT RIGHT NOW IN ITS URGENCY. AND NEXT YEAR I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO ANY STUDY THAT YOU WISH TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING AN AGENDA THAT HELPS FAMILIES AT THE END OF THE DAY MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE WERE SAYING EXACT THAT'S TRUE FOR EVERY THING EXCEPT FOR THE PERSON WHO SERVING TIME FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE ANY POTENTIAL IN SAN. SOMEONE COMMITTED A STICK FILA AND GETS THE OPPORTUNITY IS A RESULT OF THAT TO AVOID THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYING CHILD SUPPORT. THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I'M I'M NOT. I'M JUST RAISING THE ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS. THIS IS A- AND JERRY THE LAW THAT WE TEND TO WE DON'T. ISN'T PICKY. A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE ABUSING THEIR LOVED ONES AND WE THINK YOU GET THROWN IN JAIL AND- PART OF THE GOAL HERE IS THAT REUNIFICATION AND BRINGING PEOPLE BACK IN. AND I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S- I WOULD SAY TO CARPOOL BUT THIS IS FROM A GROUP OF PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN JAIL THAT ARE POOR THAT GOT ALL THE OTHER. ALL THE SIGNALS HERE THAT ARE PRODIGIOUS RAISING. HIS INITIAL MEAN I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT IT'S NOT ALL THE BOAT TO FLOAT. AT IS I IS I SEE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE IT'S A COMPLICATED THERE'S A THOUSAND DIFFERENT. SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE GET CONVICTED AND- THE- WELL I'M GLAD TO RAISE THE ISSUE MORE. I THINK A THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE PRESS WHEN I WAS A PRACTITIONER. AND NO ONE EVER ASKED WHAT ABOUT THE CUSTODIAL PARENT WHO'S LEFT HAVING TO GET TWO AND THREE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I WAS JUST EXPECTED AND MOST OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND- YOU KNOW BEING IN THE LOWER PAID JOB CATEGORIES ANYWAY JUST ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THAT SUM COMING DOWN ON THE SCALE OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE SO. HAVING THIS I THINK IS THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY WE WILL OF DONE THAT STUDY FROM THIS SIDE OF THE AVENUE AVENUE AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO BEING. VERY STRONG ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE QUALITY IN PARTICULAR GENDER EQUALITY AS WELL WILK- IF NECESSARY FOLLOW UP AFTER THE INFORMATION IS. RECEIVED AND- TRY TO MAKE WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY UNDER AN ABSOLUTELY IT IS A TOTAL LOSE LOSE SITUATION. NO MENTION THIS SHOW. WITH THAT WE HAVE I BELIEVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING THE MOTION IS. ADD TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WITH THAT MADAM CONSULTANT WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND THERE'S PLEASE TURN OUR MICROPHONE'S ON THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHT AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE BERRYHILL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS CAN AND PERHAPS MY APOLOGIES I SHOULD LET THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLOSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- VAST. JUST GOT. AND PART OF A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD I WILL REPEAT AGAIN IS JUST IMPLICIT BIAS THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT. ARE USING OUR PRISON SYSTEM TO AVOID. PAYING THEIR CHILD SUPPORT WHICH TO ME IS LUDICROUS. YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH- PARENTS ARE HOPING TO FEED THEIR KIDS. ARE COMMIT A CRIME OF ROBBING FOOD AND THEN GOES TO PRISON. YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SAY. WAS THAT INDIVIDUAL TRYING TO HELP THEIR CHILD WHILE THEY'RE PAYING CHILD SUPPORT WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO WE HAVE WHICH ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO CONTINUE TO WOULD GET PENALTIES AND FEES WHILE MAKING EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. AND THEN GETS UP ON AND THEN GET THEIR LICENSE REVOKED BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUTSTANDING CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. CAN'T GET TO A JOB. DOESN'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION. CAN BARELY AFFORD TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEN THEY CONTINUE TO HOW ISSUES WITH THEIR CHILD SUPPORT AND THEN GO BACK INTO PRISON WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS IN BOTH HOUSES- ON BREAK DOWN THE TUITION ALLIES RATE THEM FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THIS. IF IDEA THAT YOU CAN PAY CHILD SUPPORT WILL MAKING EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR IS RIDICULOUS. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT I JUST HOPE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TRUE TO OUR WORD AND IF WE ARE TO SAY THAT WE ARE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE IN OURS. THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT LAWS SECOND TENUOUSLY HARM PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT MEN. ACTUALLY HAVE A HARM. MEN OF COLOR MOSTLY FULL ARE LET ME IN BLACK. IN OUR STATE. I HOPE THAT WHILE WE DELIBERATE ON WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING. AND WHO NEED THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACT AND TO ACT NOW I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ZERO. THANK YOU MADAM CONSULTANT IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FROM THE MOTION THAT WAS MADE BY A I BELIEVE SENATOR MONNING. AGAIN PLEASE TURN TO MIKE FUNDS ON THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHTY AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. JACKSON BY.

AND NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM NINE BY- IT'S AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RADIUS AND THIS IS ON ACTION DEALING WITH CIVIL ACTIONS AND WRONGFUL DEATH AND IT HAS AN EMERGENCY PROVISIONS SO. OF MADAM REYES THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO THEIR PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL EXTEND TO LEGAL GUARDIANS THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILD IF THE CHILD PASSES AWAY DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS. CURRENT LAW SPECIFIES THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE DEATH OF A PERSON BECAUSE FOR THE WRONGFUL ACT OR NEGLECT. OF ANOTHER. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE LIMITED TO THE DECEDENT'S SPOUSECHILD AND IN SOME CASES THE PARENTS. SPECIFICALLY FOR MINOR PASSES AWAY DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS AND THE MINOR IS ON MARRIED AND DOES NOT HAVE CHILDREN. THAN THOSE WHO CAN BRING FORTH A- BY. THE MY LEGAL GUARDIANS HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY ADOPTED THE MINOR THESE LEGAL GUARDIANS DO NOT HAVE LEGAL STANDING TO BRING A CLAIM IN THE EVENT OF A WRONGFUL DEATH EVEN THOUGH BOTH OF THE CHILD'S PARENTS DECEASED. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT LAW BY ALLOWING LEGAL GUARDIANS TO BRING FORTH A WRONGFUL DEATH CASE BUT ONLY WHEN THE DECEASED CHILD'S PARENTS. HAVE ALSO PASSED AWAY. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE ALLOWS A LEGAL GUARDIAN TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR CHILD WAS PASSED AWAY DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS WHEN THE CHILD'S PARENT CANNOT DO SO. BECAUSE THEY ARE DECEASED THIS BILL IS AN IS AN URGENCY MEASURE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF DESERVING LEGAL GUARDIANS TO PROSECUTE WRONGFUL. ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR MINOR CHILDREN. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE TO ENSURE THAT WRITERS CLAIMS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY DUE TO ANTIQUATED LEGAL BARRIERS. HERE TO TESTIFY VIA TELEPHONE TODAY I HAVE BILL. GALLO WANTED WAS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW FIRM OF TAYLOR AND RING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. THE LET US SOME HERE FROM MR GILL WHAT I BELIEVE HE IS ON THE PHONE AND READY TO SPEAK IS THAT CORRECT. A THANK YOU MISTER GILL WHAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS THE ONLY WITNESS AND IF THAT'S THE CASE HE DOES HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES IF HE WISHES TO TAKE IT THANK YOU. MISTER GILL WHAT THE FLOORS YOU. THANK YOU CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY. YES. OKAY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU ABOUT THIS BILL BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION MY NAME IS NEIL KELLER WHY I AM A MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS FOR IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE. BEACH WILL. I PRACTICE IN THE AREA OF SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY WRONGFUL DEATH AND SEXUAL ABUSE ABOVE ALL AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE IS ABOUT FAIRNESS THE BILL AIMS TO CORRECT INEQUITIES IN THE LAW UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A MINOR DIES TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF OTHERS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE RIGHT CARE IS IN THE WRONG ACTION. THERE WAS. NINE CHILDREN ARE THE MINOR'S PARENT HOWEVER IF THE MINERS PARENTS PREDECEASED HIM OR HER THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO WRITE FULLY STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE MINERS PARENTS CAN PURSUE WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS ON HIS OR HER BEHALF. AS WE THE LOS WE ALREADY IN SHIP IS NOT ENOUGH THE LAW REQUIRES THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIAN TO HAVE FORMALLY ADOPTED THE MINOR IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BRING A LAWSUIT ON THE MINOR'S BEHALF. OWNER IT IN CANADA. DID SHOULD ELIMINATED AS THE LAW SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE CHANGING NATURE OF FAMILY. THIS BILL WOULD STILL REQUIRE THESE LEGAL GUARDIANS TO BE FORMALLY APPOINTED AS SUCH BY THE COURT PRIOR TO THE MINOR STAFF. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE A JUDICIAL OFFICER TO EVALUATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING THE APPOINTMENT THANK INCLUDED THE PARTY'S BRINGING THE APPLICATION SHOULD IN FACT BE OF THE MINERS LEGAL PARTY. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF PLANETS THAT MARK MAY PURSUE A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION ON BEHALF OF THE MINE. RATHER IT NEARLY ALLOW GUARDIANS TO STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE MINERS PARENTS WHEN BOTH PARENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY. IN SOME AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE NARROWLY AND THEN TO EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW FOR THE FULL PROSECUTION OF WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION. STEPPING INTO THE SHOES OF THE PARENT IS NO EASY TASK WHEN INDIVIDUALS TAKE ON THIS NOBLE VENTURE THEY SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME RIGHTS AFFORDED TO THE MINORS. THANK YOU.

BASED ON ON OUR COMPETITION LAWS ON BEHALF PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN CHOOSING WHICH CASES TO PURSUE I LOOKED FOR EGREGIOUS CASES. WHERE OUR ENVIRONMENT IS BEING HARMED CONSUMERS ARE BEING. THE WORKERS ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED FINANCE SCRUPULOUS EMPLOYER OR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR PEOPLE IS JEOPARDIZED WE TYPICALLY GIVE THE BUSINESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY.

IT THE CASE UNDER THIS LAW RECOVERS PETE. A LOT OF NEW WORK THE COW TO SHOW THE CURRENT IT.

THOUSAND OR MORE RESIDENTS AND I THINK BASICALLY THOSE ARE SAN FRANCISCO. SAN JOSE AND LOS ANGELES- AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO OPPOSITION AND THE BILL ONLY FOCUSES ON SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THERE IS AN ARGUMENT OF FAIRNESS ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU BRING THE ACTION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REAP THE BENEFITS- THERE WAS SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT THAT CAME. FROM SOME OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS BUT CLEARLY SAN DIEGO. RESOLVED ITS STIFF AND- WITH THAT I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT UP. TO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO CONTINUE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EFFORTS AND THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS-BILL OR THAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS AS BILL'S GOING TO DO IN ORDER. TO WHAT SUGGESTS CAN. IN THE PEOPLE THE COUNTY AND I COULD COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AND- CERTAINLY LOOK FOR TO SPUR IT ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WITH THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR UMBERG TO MOVE THE BILL WE HAVE A COMMENT BY MISTER BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. US BRAND THE OF HONOR HEADING INTO YOUR NAKED WOODS CHATTING WITH THE YOUR MAYOR ON CODE RE OPENING UP POLICIES AND JUST ACTUALLY LOVE YOUR BACKYARD- WHEN THIS. BILL CAME MINUTES EARLIER VERSION I HAD EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT IT WOULD HIT COUNTIES AGAIN CITIES AND VICE VERSA AND I STILL HAVE THAT ARE CONCERNED AS I EXPRESSED EARLIER. AND THIS IS. FOCUS ONLY ON SAN DIEGO WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE CAN'T BE A COUNTY CITY REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT I THINK EVERY YEAR EVERY COUNTY AND CITY GO THROUGH SOME SORT OF REVENUE SHARING DISCUSSION OR EVERY NUMBER OF YEARS- I'M SURPRISED JUST BY VIRTUE OF LOCAL CONTROL IF THEY CAN'T. REACH SOME SORT OF ACCOMMODATION IN YOUR EXPERIENCE ARE THESE PARTIES JUST AT AN IMPASSE. WELL NOT CITY WILL HAVE CONSENSUS BETWEEN BUT THE CITY IN THE COUNTY ON THIS BILL AND SUPPORT FOR- THAT CONSIDER CROSS AMERICAN SINCE THIS NOT EVIDENT IN THESE OTHER. CITIES THAT THE CHAIR REFERENCE AS A CONSEQUENCE THE BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED TO EXCLUDE THEM. ALL RIGHT- I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THIS HAPPENS IN SAN DIEGO- WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE THAT- THE CITY OF FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE IS GOING TO WANT TO HAVE- SOMETHING DIFFERENT- FRESNO COUNTY OR JUST ACROSS THE STATE- BUT- MOST IMPORTANTLY- HOW. AGAIN IS THIS SATISFACTORY OF CONDITIONS OF HAVING. A BILL HEARD THAT WAS MY LOOK MY ULTIMATE LAST POINT HERE IT'S NOT CODE RELATED IT'S NOT TIME SENSITIVE- OR- WHAT WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE BECAUSE IT THIS SOUNDS LIKE. THIS S THE JANUARY BILL. LET ME AS FRAZIER CONCERNED IN PARTICULAR FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE UP FRESNO CANNOT BRING THESE KINDS OF ACTIONS UNDER STATE LAW CURRENTLY IS TOO SMALL. SO IT'S ONLY CITIES OF SEVENTY THOUSAND OR MORE SO IF THAT KEEP ME UP NIGHTS YOU COULD SLEEP SOUNDLY TONIGHT OKAY HA HA HA CONSISTING TO COVET YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BEING SQUEEZED IN THIS PANDEMIC AND THEIR REVENUES ARE PLAN. MAKING AND HAVING TO CHOOSE VERY VOCAL. FORTIES ABOUT WHAT TO PERSON WHAT NOT TO PURSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY HE HEARD FROM A MOMENT AGO IS ACTIVELY HAND COLLUDED CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES BUT HAS TO JUDGE ON THE FACT THAT IF SHE SPENDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DOING IT. SHE'LL FOR THE REVENUE BACK SO. FOR SHADI TESTING. THROUGH DOING I DID DRIVE OF OPERATIONS CHARGING CUTS NOT DOING CALL TEST. ARTS TWENTY WANTS TO PASS THAT THE RIGHT NOW SHE ONLY GETS HOW OF THE- THAT COMES TO THE PROJECT. THE COMES AFTERWARDS AND IF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO THE SAME THING SHE GETS. NOTHING SO I HUMBLY SUGGEST THAT THIS TIME WITH CONSUMERS ARE BEING SQUEEZED BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS. ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE OUR PUBLIC WATCHDOGS AFTER DOING THE WORK AND THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY AND BECAUSE THE REVENUES UPON MANY ACTION MAKES IT LESS LIKELY WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION. I WILL CERTAINLY APPLAUD THAT EFFORT TO DRAW A NEXUS OUGHT TO COVERED AS UNIQUE AND CREATIVE AS IT WAS. AND WHAT IF. BIGGIE GETS BACK THE- THE OVERALL ON THE OVERALL IMPORT OF THIS IS WHETHER IT'S LIMITED TO COUNTIES OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OR CITIES RATHER- THE IDEA OF CREATING A CONTEST BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES EVER SIZE THEY MAY BE. HAVING SERVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN BOTH LEVELS THAT'S WHY THAT'S BIGGEST SIR IS THAT WE ARE JOB CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF REVENUE CONTROL AND- BEING VERY DOGGEDLY IN TERMS OF- WHO HAS TURF HERE VERSUS TURF THEIR THING.

I HAVE NO LINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD LET'S BRING IT BACK TO DISCUSSION BY THE MEMBERS WERE GOING TO START WITH THE SENATE BOAR SENATOR. WHY CAN'T SKI THE MORNING IN I BELIEVE URBAN SO WHAT'S GOING AND THE FOR SURE SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MANY OF YOU THAT I HAVE STRONG. IN BY IN GREEK ARMENIAN. RELY ISSUES AND FOR A LONG LONG TIME I HAVE ADVOCATED FOR PREPARATION DISCUSSIONS GIVEN THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THE LOSS OF LIFE THE LOSS OF. OF VALUABLE SECOND IN TERRITORY WHEN THERE WERE THE- WHEN THERE WAS THE FORCIBLE EXCHANGE BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE IN THE TWENTIES PRIOR TO THAT THE PONTIC GENOCIDE GREEK GENOCIDE IN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. SO THIS ISSUE PRESENTS SOME VERY NOVEL AND- COMPONENTS. THAT IF I AM TO BE CONSISTENT. IN THE BELIEF THAT. HISTORY DOES NOT HAVE A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING A WRONG. THEN I HAVE TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS AS FOR DATING. AS SLAVERY THAT IS AS PROBABLY THE MOST. PROFOUND INSIGNIFICANT. CASTOR FEE TO THE FALL OF PEOPLE. AS THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY AS IT SPEND CONTINENTS IT SPANNED CIVILIZATIONS BUT IT CONTINUED INTO MODERN PERIODS OF TIME. DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR NOTIONS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. THE REASON WHY I'M BRINGING THIS UP IS AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE GREEKS ARMENIANS AND OTHERS AS THEY TRIED IS TO SEEK REDRESS FROM THE HISTORICAL INJUSTICES THAT BEFELL THEM. THEN SO TOO SHOULD AFRICAN AMERICANS BE IN A POSITION TO SEEK REDRESS. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND OURSELVES IN AS AMERICANS. IT'S ONLY FAIR. HERE'S MY REQUEST TO. THE AUTHOR PERHAPS A BIT WILL BE THROUGH. THE CENTER BRADFORD- I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE FOR A BODY TO BE CONVENED TO STUDY THIS ISSUE. I'D SURPRISE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE- BY OTHER STATES MAYBE IT HAS BEEN I DON'T I DON'T NOW. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO SEE DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION OF THIS GROUP. IS RIGHT NOW THE APPOINTMENTS WOULD BE FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEADERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. WHAT I DON'T SEE I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL JUST AS WE'VE- LOOK AT SOUTH AFRICA CAMBODIA ARMENIA AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE HAD THESE CATASTROPHES IS THAT WHEN A GROUP IS CONVENE. THESE INDIVIDUALS BE PROPERLY SCHOOLED AND- ARE DISCIPLINED ON MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE BODY ITSELF. SO HERE'S MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD THE AUTHOR CONSIDER. THAT THE EIGHT APPOINTMENTS. BE EXPANDED I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT AMOUNT. BUT THAT IT INCLUDE COMPARED OF LAW EXPERTS. INNING THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE- THE REPORT ON THE CREATION OF THIS. COMMISSION TALKS ABOUT. THIS UNITED NATIONS ORGANS IN DIFFERENT TREES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE THIS. SO COMPARED OF LAW EXPERT. SOMEONE EXPERIENCED IN FOR EXAMPLE AS A HOLOCAUST SCHOLAR. OR SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID SCHOLAR THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A BACKGROUND IN DEALING WITH REPARATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT. JUST A- NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED BY THE PRO TEM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THE GOVERNOR AND LASTLY IT WOULD BE THAT THERE BE A POLITICAL CROSS SECTION REPRESENTED HERE. BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST THOSE THREE ENTITIES MAKING THE APPOINTMENT. I THINK IT WOULD BENEFIT. THE COMMISSION OR THIS COUNCIL. THAT BODY IN BENEFIT ALL OF US IF WE HAD SOME REPRESENTATION THAT REPRESENTED. THE CROSS SECTION OF OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. I THINK DOES A REASONABLE REQUEST I DON'T KNOW IF I'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT OPEN TO. BOB THE PRESENTER I THINK THIS HAS A LOT OF MERIT. I'M SCARED. THAT IF THE COMPOSITION IS NOT. ALL TO MODIFY. DATA WON'T BE IS AS IT NEED TO BE AND I'M ALSO AFRAID THAT WILL UNNECESSARILY IGNITE PARTISAN PASSIONS. THAT I THINK ARE INAPPROPRIATE. SOME SOME MANAGER DO YOU MIND IF I THROUGH YOU. HOSE THAT REQUEST TO THE PRESENTER. I SIR THE PRESENTER CAN COMMENT ON IT IN HIS CLOTHES A BOAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE BILL IN ADVANCE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL CALL FOR EIGHT PEOPLE ARE AND THAT THEY CANNOT ALL BE OF THE SAME PARTY SO BAD THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BUT ALL ALL THAT THE PRESENTER COMMENT ON THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SO THE CENTER BOARD OF MOVING ALONG I CAN'T REMEMBER THE ORDER I INITIALLY PRESENTED BUT IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME WILL GO TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI IN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRISONERS COMMENTS COMMENT ON HIS AT HIS CLOSE I'VE ASKED HIM TO DO THAT. A SIMPLE WHITE. THE MAN I TO WITH THE A SHOUT OUT FOR ALICE MERRILEES WHO WROTE STAFF. THIS IS. MY TENTH YEAR IN LESS. BEEN AND THE ASSEMBLY SENATE SHOULD. COMMITTEES ALL TIME AND WE DO EVERY DOES A WONDERFUL JOB THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. WAS WELL WRITTEN BUT IT ALSO. TEES UP THIS. TASK FORCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN GO BACK A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YEARS AND ASK WHY WAS THIS NOT DONE WHEN THE CIVIL WAR WAS OVER AND THEN YOU'RE INTO. YOU KNOW THE. JIM CROW LAWS IN THE N. IT IN THE TURN OF THIS. NEARLY TWO BUT- BUT THE STAFF REPORT. HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE NEW TO WAS REAL A WHITE DEAL AND AT A- EXCLUDED TO. WORKER IN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHICH SEEING IT AS I READ IT YESTERDAY JUMPED OFF THE PAGES WITH ME AND THEN I MOVED INTO. THE GI WHICH EXCLUDED AND THE RED LINE THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT AND I WAS EXCLUDED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEN YOU GET INTO THE- CRIMINAL ORDERED FEDERAL CRIMINALIZATION OF LAW ON THE MASS. INCARCERATION AND YOU'VE- IF WE DON'T TO THIS. TASK FORCE AND SET UP TO REPARATION WHAT DOES IT STOP ONE TWO WHEN. ONE DISC CALIFORNIA'S INTERAMERICAN SOCIETY. LOOK AT THESE OR THAT WE HAVE IN OUR- I. THE ALL AN AS PERCENT TODAY BRING IT I'M YOU KNOW I FILLED WITH GUILT AS THEY SHOULD BE THEN ALL THE BUSH BE ABOUT. THAT THE LACK OF A TWO THAT HAD TO THIS CANCER THAT WE HAVE IN OUR AND THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED SO I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SIR CENTER MORNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO CONVEY MY THANKS TO THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER HER LEADERSHIP MOM ON THIS AND SO MANY RELATED ISSUES AND TO THE PRESENTER SENATOR BRADFORD. I ALSO WANT TO JUST OFFER MY THINKS- TO ALISON MEREDITH IT'S AN AMAZING. ANALYSIS I'VE PRINTED OUT TO SHARE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS END THANK YOU SECOND ALSO FORWARDED IS AN EMAIL ATTACHMENT FROM THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT IT'S- IT. SO MANY WHO INCLUDING MYSELF WERE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ESTABLISHED. NOT AS A SLAVE STATE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIGHTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN MONTEREY IN WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSTITUTION. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND RECOGNIZE THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY OR NOT AND WHILE. IT DIDN'T FORMALLY YOU LOOK AT THE LEGACY IN VESTIGES OF ON SO MANY FRONTS. RECOGNIZING OWNERSHIP OF OTHER PEOPLE BY PEOPLE COMING IN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE DENIAL OF PROPERTY RIGHTS THE RED LINING IN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON TO PUT THIS IN OUR- CHALLENGE TODAY. THE DEPTH OF THE CHALLENGE MAY BE ONLY OFFSET. BY THEM MOVEMENT UNDER WAY IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. MOM THE- LOSS OF JOHN LEWIS IN YET. IN DEATH HIS LIFE IS BEING BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND SHARED AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND SO MANY OTHERS YOUNG PEOPLE STEPPING UP. IN RESISTANCE TO PLEASE PRACTICES BUT GOING BEYOND PLEASE PRACTICES I FULLY SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COMMISSION I WOULD HOPE THAT PART OF THE ITS STUDY WOULD LOOK TO THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSIONS ESTABLISHED BY NELSON MANDELA. FROM IN ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU IN SOUTH AFRICA A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AT DIFFERENT HISTORY BUT DEEP WOUNDS COMING OUT OF DECADES OF WAR- IN APARTHEID IN CONVENING. FORUM WHERE PEOPLE FACE EACH OTHER AND SHARED THEIR LOSS THEIR GRIEF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND WAS A HEALING PROCESS THAT STILL UNDER WAY BUT IT WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE LEADERS. OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REVOLUTION THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. THIS NEVER HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS WOULD MARK A STARTING POINT- GLAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'D- BE PROUD TO. MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR TO RUSSELL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR GONZALEZ AND I SEE SENATOR STERN'S HAND IS UP SO. HE WILL BE. PROBABLY BEFORE CLOSE- BUT LET'S GO AHEAD TO SENATOR TO ROSTER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD FOR. PRESENT TO A THE ANTE. A DOCTOR WEBER ON THE OFFICE OF. REPORT ON THIS. YOUR STAFF OF. THE AMAZING AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO JUST GONNA RUSHED SHARE THIS A THE- THERE IS A SURE. A LOT THAT WILL BE ON CA AND OF. MATURE DAMAGE AND LOSSES THAT WERE INFLICTED ON ON GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE TRAUMA AND THEIR ARE A LOT OF THINGS. WHEN ASKED WHEN DOES IT STOP. IT STOPS WILL WE TO THE BOND OF IT ALL STOP SO WE REALLY FIGURE THE- OF THE DAMAGE TO- IN GENERATIONS OF A BLACK AMERICANS- AND I HOLD THROUGH THIS JUST AS- THE- ANALYSIS BECAME MORE OF A- OF A HISTORIC- PICTURE. ALL WE CAN YOU FURTHER BECAUSE AS AS SLAVES TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH IN THE SOUTHEAST AND THEY WENT MORE MORE WEST- THEY WERE THEY WERE MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO I MEAN THEY WANT TO TAXES UP BEFORE WITH TEXAS. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM SLAVERY. AND THE PRIMARY REASON THAT THERE WAS A ME U. S. MEXICO WALLER WAS BECAUSE OF A VERY. THE OF PEOPLE LIVING IN TEXAS SAID WE WANT SLAVERY HERE TOO AND THEY WERE PART OF MEXICO AND IT WAS ILLEGAL IN MEXICO FOR DECADES BEFORE IT HAD. BECOME ILLEGAL SO. THERE IS SO MUCH TO UNCOVER THAT I HOPE IN THE PROCESS. OF COMING UP WITH WHAT THE- THE PLAN ON THE ON THE REPARATIONS HOW TO ADDRESS REPARATIONS THAT WE ALSO USES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. EDUCATE AND INFORM- OF SO MANY OF US ON MANY ISSUES THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND FINALLY I WANT TO GIVE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE- I'VE MENTIONED THIS WITH REGARDS TO- THE LOSS OF CONGRESSMAN LEWIS. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE DID THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS FREEDOM RIDE WHICH WAS REALLY AN% EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF AMERICANS OF ALL COLORS. OF TRAVELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AND STOPPING IN SMALL TOWNS AND BIG CITIES- AND ENDING UP IN AND NEW YORK AND- REMEMBER WHAT THE- IMMIGRANT TO OR THE BOOKS WHEN WE STOP. TO BURN A THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND AFRICAN. IN THE STORE WRITES ME. ON DATE KNOW THEY DIDN'T KNOW. THE HUMAN.

I'M NOT JUST IN THE CASE IN HISTORY BY THE HIS OF EACH OF OUR CITIES IN IN IN TERMS OF RECONCILING THE HISTORY OF FOR INSTANCE THE KKK THAT WAS IN- LONG BEACH IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT WE- REALIZE.

THE MOST- IMPORTANT THING A PROFOUND THING FOR ME. AND THE TASK FORCE. RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAYS EDUCATE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OF THE TASK FORCE'S FINDINGS AND ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY. UNDERSTANDS OUR HISTORY IN THIS WAY- BUT IT'S GOING TO SET THE STAGE CERTAINLY FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE WHICH I'M VERY PROUD TO. TO THE- THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN.

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US TODAY. MARTY THE- SINGLE FOR DEBATE OR DO ON TO THANK YOU AS WELL AND THANK THE HUNDRED SO WHO GOT ON THE PHONE AND PAY WE TO THEIR FOR THIS MEASURE. IT IS MORE LONG DUE. BOGGLES MY MIND THAT TO WE ARE SO IGNORANT ACTUALLY OF A LOT OF THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. EVEN THOSE OF OUR AND ESTERS THAT WE'RE NOT COMPLICIT BACK IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES OF WHO WERE EITHER IGNORANT OR UNINFORMED AND FRANKLY IN READING THIS DOCUMENT I REALIZED THAT I ALSO LIKE I THINK PROBABLY MOST OF US. ARE NOT AWARE OF THE DEPTHS. OF THE DISCRIMINATION AND THE- CURRENT EXTRAORDINARY DE HUMANIZATION. OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO I FIND THIS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT WORTHWHILE MOMENT TO ITS COMP AIDED. TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE AMERICA WE ALL AS A TRIBUTE TO ASCRIBE TO IS REALLY AN ASPIRATIONAL AMERICA. THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT US HISTORICALLY VIRTUALLY EVERY. IMMIGRANT GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY WAS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST I THINK OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WERE SYSTEMATICALLY- OF VICTIMIZED- I THINK OF. A JUST ABOUT EVERY GROUP- WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE IRISH THE ITALIANS IN NEW YORK CAN CERTAINLY MY A JEWISH ANCESTORS BUT NOBODY ARE AT UNDER WENT THE BLATANT A BREAK UP OF. AND THE D. HUMAN. WE BROUGHT PEOPLE OVER TO THEIR- A FROM AFRICA IN SEOUL OFF FAMILIES. IT IN BUT HE DIDN'T IN A WAY THAT ABSOLUTELY IN HUMAN. AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE FRANKLY I THINK TO SOME OF US SO TO LEARN ABOUT THAT IN TO FACE THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IN HOPES SAYS IN THE SPIRIT OF JOHN LEWIS WOULD MAKE US BETTER I THINK IS. AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CERTAINLY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BUT PASSED SO WITH THAT- SENATOR SHOULD LIKE TO CLOSE FOR SMART I WOULD TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AS MY CLOTHES BUT I WILL TRY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERN ISSUES THAT SIN REPORTAGE REYES AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF THE- OF. THIS ARE COMMITTEE- RIGHT NOW WHY OPEN TO GET THIS WHAT EIGHT PASSED TO SO I'M PRETTY WE WHAT WE LOOK AT A LARGE. BODY IF THAT WAS. YEAH WE WILL. BUT AS SAY YOU DO FOR ONE THAT SO START WITH THAT EIGHT BUT WE'RE- SURE AND WE ARE GONNA SIGN. THAT BILLS EIGHT OURS THE MOST. PEOPLE ON THIS WITH THIS ISSUE WE'RE JUST GONNA A SONG AN OLD PEOPLE BE A SIGN WILLIE NAY. TO LET'S LOOK AT REBEL WE WANT HIS STORY WE WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LEGAL BACKGROUND RESEARCH BACKGROUND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA BE NECESSARY TO TRACE BACK ALL THE DAMAGES. AND RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN IN SLAVE ARE ENTITLED TO THROUGH OUT THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF BEING BROUGHT TO THIS LAND AS FAR AS A DIVERSITY OF OPINION THAT'S CRITICAL- I A FEW SPEAKING PARTY I THINK. ONLY OUR CURRENT. WAS NOT A THAT A LINCOLN OR- IN IN AND NOT UNDER THAT HE PROBABLY WASN'T THAT AFTERNOON UP UNTIL THE SICK WERE REPUBLIC SO WE WANT DIVERSITY OF POLITICAL PARTY BACK TOOL WE WORK AS A PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHO WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO WE WILL WALK OUT BIPARTISAN PARTICIPATION AS IT MAKES UP THIS BODY BECAUSE AGAIN. MARTIN LUTHER KING'S FAMILY WERE REPUBLICANS UNTIL THE SIXTIES UNTIL KENNEDY. BUT A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW THAT. IN MANY BLACKS. REPUBLICANS THIS COUNTRY UNTIL THE EARLY. SIXTIES BECAUSE A RIVER LINCOLN AND HE DID THE FREE FLOW. AND WHAT HE IN A MATTER PROP. OF THE OF ROUGH. THAT WAS QUICKLY ALL. AFTER HIS A SOUTH. THE P. FILLED UNDERSTAND. AND THE ROUNDABOUT WAY TO RE INSTITUTIONALIZING SLAVERY THROUGH THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT MASS INCARCERATION IS NOTHING NEW HERE WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT HAS ALLOWED WHO BY SLAVERY THE LAST. HUNDRED AND YEARS TO MASS GARCIA. AND WHEN TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SINGLE FAMILIES. LIKE FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN THIS IS BEEN INSTITUTIONAL. IT WAS TO BLACK FAMILIES ADVANTAGES THE KICKED THE MAN OUT THE HOUSE BECAUSE WHAT THE IT LEARN TO SLAVERY SEPARATING FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE INSTITUTIONAL TO AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR AGAIN SINCE OUR EXISTENCE AND THAT'S HAS MEANING REMY TALK ABOUT HOW ARE YOU IMAGE IN THE LOW PERFORMANCE OF SCORES IN EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY WENT AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. I AN AMERICAN SHIP INSTEAD OF LEARNING THE OTHER GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN THE CATHOLIC MORE THAN THE JEWS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE AND IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS TO THE- THOUSANDS THIS. BLACK COLLEGES WE VALUE EDUCATION BUT THROUGH THE SYSTEMATICS. SYSTEM HERE IN AMERICA DISCO OPPRESSION OF THE NILE. PUNISHING YOU LEARN GETTING YOUR EYES GOUGED OUT AS A SLAVE FOR LEARNING TO READ. BEING PUT TO DEATH LOSE YEAH I HAD EIGHT. A LAW ON THE BOOKS UP UNTIL THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS ACT IF YOU WERE A SLAVE IN YOU TALK TO YOUR CHILD TO READ. YOU COULD BE SENTENCED TO DEATH. THERE WERE SEVENTY TWO LAWS ON THE BOOKS IN LOUISIANA. FOR DEATH FOR BLACK FOLKS ONLY TO WIN A RELATED TO WHITES. SO WHAT THIS IS AT ALL OF YOU AGREE TO IS A HISTORY LESSON. IS A HISTORY LESSON THAT WE SO BADLY NEED HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. ABOUT WHAT. WE WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS REPRESENTED. IT'S BADLY EEDED SO I'M HONORED TO BE. A JOINT AUTHORED DOCTOR WEBER A CALL AUTHORED SHOULD TO. DOCTOR WHETHER WAS DOCTOR WAS MINE. TEACHER MY FOR YEAR IN COLLEGE. AND I DROPPED TO REPLY BECAUSE I SAW HOW YOU'LL BE FEEL PREPARED I WAS. A THE BAR HIS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE AMERICA HISTORY SO. HELLO TRACK THERE BUT IT ALL TIES IN WHAT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND AGAIN IT DOES NOT SPELL OUT THE FORMER REFEREE THAT WE WILL THAT WE WILL TAKE. BUT I EVERY DOES TAKE A BLUE ON UP AS MESSED TO ADDRESS THE PERSISTENT A FAX OF SLAVERY AND ITS SUCCESSORS. INCLUDING JIM CORAL. SHARECROPPING REDLINING WAY TO LABOR. OVER IN CARS OVER POLICE. AND SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION IN THE PAST WE HAVE. RIGHTLY ADDRESS DEGREE JUST WRONG TO REPARATIONS FOR JAPANESE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WERE PUT AN INTERNMENT CAMPS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. WE'VE GOT DRESSED AND IN THE BEST WAY SO FAR FAR NATIVE AMERICANS WHO HAD. ALL OF THEIR LAND STOLEN FROM THEM. ALL THE COASTAL LOWLANDS MALIBU TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS ALL NATIVE AMERICAN LANDS THOSE REST RESERVATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NOW IN LYNN AND ROCKY ON FAR BEHIND RANCH THE LAND. WAS A PUNISHMENT. THANK AND THEIR LAN STAKING AWAY THAT TO MAKE SOMEONE MAY TO MEN'S I SHOULD SAY TO. THE COMPACT SO WE PROVIDE THEM TO BUT NOT AFTER AMERICAN. WE HAVE YET TO SEE. ANY JUSTICE SO WE RECKON IT AND A THREE A RESPONSE. AND THE GREATER. THE LONGER THE LEGACY. THE WANTED AT A REPARATIONS AFTER THE CIVIL CIVIL WAR THAT WAS PROMISED THE FORTY ACRES AND A MULE WAS REVERSED AS I STATED SHIRLEY AFTER LINCOLN WAS ASSASSINATED FORMER SLAVES ENDED UP WORKING ON THE LAND. OF THEIR FORMER- AND SLIPPERS. SOME REPARATIONS WERE ACTUALLY PAID BUT NOT TO THE SLAVE BUT TO THE FARMER. AND SLAVE OWNER WHO LOST THEIR SLAVES THEY WERE PAID COMPENSATION FOR THOSE SLAVES THAT HAS SINCE BEEN FREE. AGAIN THIS PANDEMIC HAS CLEARLY SHOWN ITS DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BLACK CALIFORNIA'S AS WELL AS BLACK AMERICANS AND IT'S ONLY THE LATEST REMINDER OF THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY THAT IS NEVER BEEN TRULY ADDRESSED AND IT'S SO FITTING THAT WE'RE DOING THIS. MEASURE TODAY AGAIN WE SAN PAYING HOMAGE TO THE JEWISH RELATIONSHIP AS IT IS MORE INTO THE LOSS BUT WE MORE JOHN LEWIS TODAY HE WAS LAID TO REST TODAY AND I WAS PROVIDED.

REFUGEES ARE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO ARE FORCED TO FLEE THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. TO SEEK SAFETY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY DUE TO WAR. GOVERNMENTAL OF HABEL OR PERSECUTION BASED UPON THE RELIGION NATIONALITY OR MEMBERSHIP IN A PARTICULAR SOCIAL OR POLITICAL GROUP. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG TRADITION OF OFFERING REFUGE TO THOSE IN NEED HAVE BEEN RECEIVED A SUPPORTED NEARLY RECORD A NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY PROBABLY BEFORE THAT. THESE REFUGEES THEN TURN AROUND AND CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE INCLUDING SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING POWER AND THE DIVERSITY WE ARE SO PROUD OF. WITH FEDERAL FUNDING SUPPORT RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES ASYLUM SEEKERS AND DOCTOR RECIPIENTS THIS BILL CODIFIES INTO IN OUR STATE LAW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPHOLD OUR COMMITMENT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AS BAD I AM DONE I DO THEN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE AND SAN DIEGO. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE WE REFER TO THAT AS THE IRISH SEA- THE I RC AS THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT AGENCY WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE OFFICES SPREAD ACROSS FIFTEEN STATES IN THE US. AND HEARING CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEVEN RESETTLEMENT SITES. WE ARE ONE OF NINE NATIONAL AGENCIES ASSISTING REFUGEES AND THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE REUNITING WITH FAMILY AFTER FLEEING WAR CONFLICT IN PERSECUTION. I'M PARTICIPATING TODAY TO REPRESENT THE IRISH HE'D SUPPORT FOR AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY THREE. I SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT OF THE PROCESS THAT IS DESIGNED AS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND EVENTS MENTIONED- IT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS AN INCORPORATE THAT THE SUPPORT OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. MANY COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND THE REFUGEE RESETTLING- AGENCIES THAT FACILITATE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR OUR CLIENTS. AS RECESSES RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES WE WORK CLOSELY WITH A WIDE RANGE OF LOCAL AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE FEDERALLY FUNDED SUPPORT TO HELP NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS SUCH AS ASYLUM SEEKERS TO INTEGRATE INTO AND FIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND DESPITE ALL THIS COORDINATION. THEIR RELATIONSHIP THAT MANIFEST IN A SUCCESSFUL RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM CAN BE ELIMINATED IN AN ACTION AND SWIFT AS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE RESETTLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS FACED UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS AGAINST WHAT WAS ONCE A STANDARD ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN A FEW YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED STATE BOB TO WITHDRAW FROM THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. AND THEN ADMINISTRATION WHICH THIS PAST WINTER REQUIRED GOVERNORS AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. TO PUBLICLY AND PROACTIVELY CERTIFIED THEIR CONSENT IF THEY WISH TO SEE WE SETTLEMENT CONTINUING THEIR STATE. ABSENT THERE'S BY AN RESETTLEMENT WOULD HAVE ENDED IN OUR STATE COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WELCOMING HOME FOR THE WORLD'S MOST VULNERABLE AND AT RISK IT IS THE STATE WHERE THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM AS WE KNOW IT TODAY WAS ACTUALLY BORN AND WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF SOUTHEASTERN. ASIAN REFUGEES ARRIVED SEEKING SAFETY AND SHELTER. REFUGEES ARRIVED IN A VERY TO WORK AND THEY HAVE MADE THEIR MARK IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY. CONTRIBUTING TO MAJOR INDUSTRY STARTING BUSINESSES BOTH SMALL AND LARGE AND REVITALIZING COMMUNITIES AS THEY MAKE THEIR HOMES AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES HERE. AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC REFUGEES ARE SERVING AS THE SPECIAL WORKERS IN A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES AND THOSE WITH HEALTHCARE TRAINING ARE STEPPING UP TO HELP ON THE FRONT LINES OUR STATE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES BENEFIT FROM THEIR RESILIENCE. FINALLY AND IMPORTANTLY GIVEN SUPPORT AND OPPORTUNITY REFUGEES GO ON TO PROBABLY BECOME THE SOME OF OUR MOST DEVOTED AND ENGAGED U. S. THAT IS AN- WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA REMAIN A WALKING STATE FOR REFUGEES. THIS BILL PROMOTE THE UNIFIED HONORING THE CONTRIBUTION OF REFUGEES THAT THEY JOINED THE FABRIC OF U. S.

I HAVE NO FURTHER LINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- WE WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE DíAS AND I WANT TO THANK A- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND TO. FORGE SENATOR DRAWS THOSE PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. WHETHER THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OVER INVOLUNTARILY AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PREVIOUSLY AS SLAVES OR WHETHER THEY CAN THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO CAME OVER FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD TO OVERCOME. OF FAMINE AND WAR AND- GENOCIDES SO IT COULD THIS COUNTRY HAS. A HISTORY OF OPENING ITSELF UP WHETHER IT'S A TOUGH ROAD TO GET THAT ACCEPTANCE ONCE THEY GET HERE. OF COURSE IS FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS TO DISCUSSION FOR US TO. LEARN ABOUT- BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN EASY BUT IT IS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WITH THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION AND THE PROMISE. THAT IF THEY- CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND THEY WORKED HARD AND THEY DID THEIR BEST AND THEY PLAY BY THE RULES THEY COULD SUCCEED AND IT HAS BEEN PROVEN FOR SO MANY TO BE THE CASE. AND YET OF WE STILL FINE THAT THERE ARE THOSE WANT TO PUT UP OBSTACLES AND WALLS. ARE AND KEEP OUT OTHERS AFTER WE HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT OPPORTUNITY AND CERTAINLY- IT IS A VERY SAD MOMENT THAT IT HAS BECOME- A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. AT THIS POINT WE KNOW THE REFUGEES TRYING TO ESCAPE WAR- IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE STORIES OF LEGION PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE BECAUSE OF OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I HAVE. FAMILY HERE FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND TO OF SADLY WE HAVE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT- YOU KNOW HIS BASICALLY. IN CITED THOSE KIND OF INTERNET SEEN WARS AND OF COURSE THE ORDERS OF MASS- A FEDERAL OURT ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED THAT OF MR TRUMP'S ORDER EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTEEN EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT- WAS DEFICIENT IN TERMS OF PASSING CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER COMPLYING WITH THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLES AND SATISFYING THE STRICTURES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT- IN OTHER MATTERS OF LAW THAT DON'T SEEM TO. MEAN A WHOLE LOT TO. THIS INDIVIDUAL BUT TO ITS CREDIT THE OF THE FEDERAL COURT DID ENJYING THAT ORDER NONE THE LESS IT IS ON APPEAL. AND I THINK IT'S AND THAT WE- RECOGNIZE AND VALUE THOSE PEOPLE IN RECOGNIZING VALUE THE LAW. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S NO LOCALITY THAT IS SUPPOSED THIS BILL OR HAS IT SUGGESTED THAT IT'S AN UNDUE INFRINGEMENT ON LOCAL CONTROL- IT REALLY ISN'T CONTROVERSIAL IT IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA LOCALITIES. NOT REFUSE TO CONSENT TO RESETTLE REFUGEES IN A WAY THAT INTENTIONALLY OR EFFECTIVELY. DISCRIMINATES ON THE BASIS OF RACE OR GENDER OR OTHER PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC SO- THIS BILL REALLY. I WOULD REFER TO IT IS SORT OF A NO BRAINER. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN OPENING OUR DOORS. TO OUR THE REFUGEE POPULATION IT IS HERE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE IS ALL OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND GREAT GRANDPARENTS AND GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS BEFORE THEM HAVE DONE SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND- WOULD WELCOME ANY OTHER COMMENTS. CENTER ON BURKE MOVES THE BILL. THE COMMENTS ALL RIGHT- SENATOR DRAWN SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR VERY GOOD SO THE MOTION BY SENATOR UMBERG IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND SO PLEASE STERN YOUR MICROPHONES ON. THIS IS FILE NUMBER EIGHTEEN A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY THREE AGUIAR-CURRY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR JACKSON HI JACKSON I A BOARD JUST.

STERN I AM BURKE I'VE UMBERG AYE WHY CASCADE A CASKET EIGHT ZERO WITH THE MISSING MEMBER VOTE IS EIGHT TWO ZERO WITH A ONE ONE MEMBER MISSING WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN AND WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH OUR NEXT A BILL WE WILL ASK ANY MEMBERS WHO WERE NOT HERE WHO WISH TO VOTE TO PLEASE COME BACK BECAUSE- WE WILL THEN DO ONE ROUND. AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE THE ROLES WITH THAT WE HAVE ONE FINAL BILL THIS IS AB THIRTY THREE SIXTY C. THIRTY THREE SIXTY SIX THE. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY MEASURE FOR DEALING WITH JUDICIAL EMERGENCIES AND IT ALSO HAS AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE. OF SENATOR EXCUSE ME AS MEMBER STONE WELCOME TO A PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT. THANK YOU I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE'S RESPONSE OF PANDEMIC SHOWN THAT A LOT OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR A STATEEMERGENCY ARE SOMETIMES INADEQUATE IN FACT WHEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL NEEDED AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST WHAT IT NEEDED TO ADJUST IT TOOK. A AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SO INSTEAD OF LETTING THE EXECUTIVE ALWAYS THAT THEN I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US IS AS THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ALLOW. ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTION DURING STATEWIDE. EMERGENCIES THE EXISTING LAW. ALLOWS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THESE EMERGENCIES BUT IT'S ONLY A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THAT COUNTY WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT GIVES A FORTY TWO. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO THE CHAIR THE USUAL COUNSEL. TO THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ON WIDE OPEN BECAUSE THESE EMERGENCIES DON'T ARE NOT CONTAINED COUNTY BY COUNTY. SO IT'S ABOUT EFFICIENCY IT'S ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE SETTING THE STANDARD. FOR THE- JUDICIAL BRANCH TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO ADDRESS. EMERGENCIES AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU OF WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR WITNESSES ONLINE I WILL HAVE TO REPEAT THAT DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS. COMMITTEES ARE INSTITUTING OR BE REQUIRED TO INSTITUTE A THREE MINUTE TIME LIMIT- TO BE SHARED BETWEEN THE I BELIEVE THERE TO WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ALL OTHERS WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES OF THE SAME WILL APPLY TO ANY OPPOSITION. AND WITH THAT- I BELIEVE WE HAVE- NANCY TRAVEL WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS MIKE BELOW TO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL. ALSO ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT. BETTER MODERATORS CHECK CORRECT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS NANCY TRAVEL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE MANSION AND THE COPA CRISIS REALLY LAID BARE THE INADEQUACY OF THE CURRENT AUTHORITY. FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO DEAL WITH THE STATE WIDE EMERGENCY. SO THIS BILL IS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP. TO GIVE HER THE AUTHORITY TO ATTEMPT TO OF HOPE WITH THE TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. EVEN WITH THE AUTHORITY THAT SHE WAS GRANTED BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND NOW THE AUTHORITY THAT WOULD BE OFFERED UNDER THIS STILL. ACROSS THE STATE WE REALLY HAVE SEEN EXTREME IN EQUITY. IN HOW FULL WHO NEED TO GO TO COURT CAN GET JUSTICE- MISTER BELOW NEIER REPRESENTING. PEOPLE WHO HAVE CIVIL CASES AND OF COURSE THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ELDER ABUSE TO POLICE BRUTALITY TO PERSONAL INJURY TO PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING AND THIS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION GOING FORWARD. IS THAT TRIAL DATES ARE BEING SEVERELY DELAYED IN SOME COUNTIES PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO. ELECTRONICALLY FILE AND OTHER COUNTIES THEY CAN'T IN SOME COUNTIES THEY CAN GET A COURT DATE AND OTHERS THEY CAN'T. AND SO THIS BILL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO STARTING TO HAVE UNIFORMITY INJUSTICE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHICH COUNTY YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET YOUR DAY IN COURT. ON SO WE THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL- ALONG WITH NECESSARY FUNDING FOR THE COURTS SO THEY CAN OPERATE REMOTELY AND THEY CAN'T PROVIDE JUSTICE TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER RUBBLE NEXT MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS A MIKE BELOW TO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL I WOULD MERELY ADD. THAT THIS WE DON'T VIEW THIS INTERROGATION OF THE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY AUTHORITY OF INDIVIDUAL PRESIDING JUDGES. A THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TAKEN INTO- IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION- BUT AS- HIS TRAVEL NOTED YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE PEOPLE OPERATE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES- AND SO THERE OUGHT TO BE REASONABLE. ASSURANCE THAT JUSTICE WILL BE A FORM. REGARDLESS OF WHICH COUNTY YOU'RE IN ITS- HE- WRITTEN CONTEMPLATION OF A CATASTROPHE OF FIRE OR OR SOME AFFECT A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES AND REALLY DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY LIKE THE PANDEMIC HOUSE HAS GIVEN US SO AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF WHO THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS- IN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AND FOR THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT- LET'S GO TO- FORTY TWO OR THREE TO THE ROOM WHERE IN AND ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SEEING ONE OF ROOM TWENTY FORTY. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM SO WE WILL- TAKE IT NOW TO- WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCING SERVICES MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY THREE SIXTY SIX.

OF THE WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH AND I THINK A HUNDRED YEARS AND CERTAINLY. OF REDUCING. OF THE PROCESS STREAMLINING THE PROCESS HAS BECOME A VALUABLE ALTHOUGH THIS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING MORE THAN CHEN STREAMLINE IT AND TO.
