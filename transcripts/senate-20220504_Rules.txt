FOR THAT STATEMENT AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL OF THE SUCCESSES IT'S QUITE A IT'S QUITE A RESUME- AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY I THINK I WILL ASK MY VICE CHAIR IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO START US OFF- WITH COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I'M MADAM PRO TEN AND- LET ME I SHARE MY- COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR RESUME AND HOW YOU ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM SOULFUL VARIANCE INSPIRATIONAL. AND CERTAINLY THAT'S BEEN PASSED ON THROUGH YOUR FAMILY AND I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN YOUR RESUME AND SENIOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ARE EQUALLY AMAZED OUT SOMEONE WHO. IT'S NOT AND EVEN TO OUR COUNTRY YEAH HAS AND SHE SO MUCH AND IT HAS BEEN SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL HOPE TO DO BUT YOU'RE A KIND OF AT THE TOP OF THE- THE TOP OF THE LIST OF ACHIEVING THAT FLOW- IT'S MY HONOR ACTUALLY TO SIT ON RULES AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING OUR YOUR- AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT I THINK WAS DISTURBING TO ME IN MANY MANY OFF PROBABLY WHO CAME THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WAS A REVISION OF THE K. THROUGH TWELVE MATH CURRICULUM. AND I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY ALLEGATIONS ACCUSATIONS THAT WE WERE DUMBING DOWN OUR MATH CURRICULUM AND- OBVIOUS. WHAT PLEASE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN YOUR BILL TO ACHIEVE IN THE IN THE WORLD UPSIDE SO AND CERTAINLY. SO COULD YOU COMMENT ON ON WHERE WE GO FROM HERE I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN OFF. FOR DIVE INTO THAT WHOLE ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE COMING. CORRECT ON TO. LOOKING AT REQUIRED A MORE MATH MORE SO. OF OUT OR- PUBLIC LEVEL FROM CERTAINLY. THE ON. THE ON NINE THROUGH TWELVE GRADES SO THAT THEY ARE COMPETITIVE CERTAINLY WILL- COLLEGE ENTRANCE AND CERTAINLY ALL THOSE COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SEEM TO REALLY BE FOCUSING ON THAT. KIND OF A LITTLE INTRODUCTION TO OF A QUESTION THAT- IF YOU COULD SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THAT WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL TO ME IF I SPEAK TO MY CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE PARENTS IN PARTICULAR WHO ALL CHILDREN ARE I THINK AT THE CUSP OF ENTERING ON. THE ARM NINE THROUGH TWELVE YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER BATES FOR- FOR THAT QUESTION VERY INTERESTING QUESTION AND- I AM. A STRONG ADVOCATE OF THEM EDUCATION I'M A STRONG ADVOCATE- THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE DIAMETER OF THE PIPELINE KATE TO TWELVE- IN TERMS OF ENGAGING THESE KIDS. AT A YOUNG AGE TO BE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE AND MATH AND NOT TO SHY AWAY FROM ME ESPECIALLY NONTRADITIONAL- A POPULATIONS LIKE GIRLS AND MAPS. YOU KNOW THE GIRLS CAN BE SHY AWAY FROM THAT AND WE NEED TO BREAK THAT STIGMA DOESN'T AND- GET THEM INVOLVED. EARLY ON NOW. WHEN I WANT TO BE A ASTRO HOW DOES YEARS OLD AND MERE GRADE. WHEN I SAW THE VERY LAST THE PROBLEM- THAT LANDED ON THE MOON AND WATCHING ASTRONAUT GENE CERNAN WALKS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AND I KNEW DARREN BAND WATCHING AND LISTENING TO ASTRONAUT GENE CERNAN POPULATION CONTROL HOUSTON THAT I WANTED. TO DO THAT. KILEY WHAT MOTOR TO GET INTO MATH AND SCIENCE IN WE NEED TO THINK. OUR KIDS AT A YOUNGER AGE- JUST LIKE THAT I TV. UNUSED GAUGED. N. N. M. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO IN THE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM INTERESTED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HIGH SCHOOLS REQUIRE. THREE YEARS OF SCIENCE THAT THEY REQUIRE IT- MASSIVE THAT THEY CAN COME IN AND BE WELL PREPARED AND- YOU SEE SYSTEMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. YOU KNOW- SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS THE HEART BEAT HARD ECONOMY AND NOT ONE I. DO READ THE STATISTICS SAYING THAT THE US ONLY GRADUATES THE THOUSAND ENGINEERS A YEAR AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT. INDIA IN SRI. VETERANS SIX AND THOUSAND I RESPECT THE A YOU I YOU KNOW YOU MAY WANT SAY WELL THAT'S A LOT. IT IS A LOT BUT WE FIVE YEARS FROM AND YOU KNOW GOING BE THE THAT ARE THE FOR OF TAKING IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW AND SO I'M ALL FOR HOW DO WE DO THAT HELP REACH WE GOT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE THE KIDS AT A YOUNG AGE HE BERMAN GAUGE AND ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. TEMPUS SO THAT ONE DAY- THE ARE GOING TO COLLEGE AND HOPEFULLY TO USE SYSTEM. AND SO IT'S HOW WE OUT WE OUT WE KEEPING THEM ENGAGED AND ON ACTIVITIES. THE IN IN IN. THE MAKE A LONG- EVEN BIT LONG I. AGREE WITH YOU WE JUST WORKING FAR HARDER THAN WE DO NOW TO ENGAGE OUR KIDS AND YOUNGER. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK ALL. WILL COME ABOUT THOSE WHO FALL BEHIND IN THAT. IF WE REQUIRE SOMETHING HIGHER THAN THAT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE. OUTSIDE THE REALM OF OPPORTUNITY AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THE SCHOOL HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. FROM ON THE ONE IF YOU TAKE THE BELL SHAPED CURVE WELL WE FROM THEM. ONE INTO THE OTHER TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. AND THOSE WHO HAVE PROBABLY HAD A DIFFERENT. UPBRINGING ON MAYBE NOT AS MUCH EXPOSURE WHICH I HOPE CERTAINLY THERE ARE. DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BRAND AND OUR ABILITIES AND THEY ARE GIVEN THAT YOUR- IN THE EARLIER YEARS THAT TO SWITCH. OFF FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LET'S. OF KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOT BEING. ABLE TO TAKE ALGEBRA ONE SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE THROUGH. THE HIGHER OF COURSE DECIDE IS WHAT REALLY TROUBLED MY CONSTITUENT ON PARENTS. SO ON NEED TO KEEP RAISING THE FLAG ON THAT ONE FOR SURE. BECAUSE I THINK WE TRY TO COMPENSATE. IN A DIFFERENT FASHION FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD. THE EXPOSURE AND THE OPPORTUNITY THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT RATHER THAN TRYING TO. YOU KNOW USE THE TERM THAT MY PARENTS AND WAS IN THE PRESIDENT BEING DOWN. CREASE THE OP. BILLABLE JOBS NOT OKAY WE'RE GOING YOU KNOW MAKE YOU MEAN AND THEN OUT NOTE SAYS YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS WHO CAME TO YOU AND THAT SORT DOESN'T ALSO FEEL WHICH HUGE HUGE SELF HUGE IN PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVING AN EDUCATION ONE LAST QUESTION UP ON IS ABOUT THE THAT RATHER INCREDIBLY LARGE SALARIES FOR PROVIDING OUR COUNSELORS WHEN I SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO RAN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION- OINTMENTS ARE THERE ARE. TALKING ABOUT. AND COST FROM AFFORDABILITY SO THAT EDUCATION IS THERE FOR EVERYONE. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE SALARIES THAT WERE RECENTLY INCREASED AND NOW THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. HOW MUCH TUITION IS THERE SHOULD BE AN THE 5% CAP MAYBE BUT THE REGION'S HAVE AN ABILITY TO INCREASE THAT. WHEN YOU INCREASE SALARIES THIS MUCH FOR EXAMPLE UCLA GETTING- FORTY A HUNDRED. THOUSAND DOLLARS SENSE THE THIRD BASE NOW. YOU KNOW SIX ALMOST SIX FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SHOCKING NUMBERS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT KIDS HAVING FOOD IN SECURITY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AW NO HOUSING AND WE'RE PAYING A ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT.BOB I. THE RATION IS A NIGHT HIGHER HOW WE TRIED TO YOU KNOW MEET THIS- PERCENTILE THOUGHT ON WHEN I WAS THE CITY IN ALSO A SUPER THAT WAS JUST GO A LOT WE HAVE TO KEEP TALENT BY KEEPING WITHIN THAT MEAN ARRANGEMENT SOME OF THOSE I DO BELIEVE ARE EXAGGERATED SO LET ME HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND MEET THESE LIVING COSTS WHICH ALSO INCLUDE PENSIONS THAT GOAL THE LIFETIME OF ALL THESE FOLKS AND WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A RECESSION. IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND THAT WON'T AFFECT THOSE SALARIES I WOULD ASSUME THE BILL CERTAINLY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF- CLASSES AND CERTAINLY. THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE CERTAINLY AFFECTED OUR WHEN WE HAVE A RECESSION AND THE ABILITY TO PAY. FOR CLASSES AND COLLEGE EDUCATION. R. I APPRECIATE THE- FIFTY QUESTION A SENATOR BATES AND- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THEUC SYSTEM IS A PRE MERE EDUCATION SYSTEM IT'S A MODEL TO BE FOLLOWED IF THE MODEL THAT EVERYBODY ADMIRES AND LOOKS UP TO- BUT- THE WAY WE GOT HERE IS WE WANT TO HIRE THE BEST. AND RETAIN THE BEST SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN OUR PROGRAMS CAN REMAIN VIABLE AT THE FOREFRONT AND I AM AND BE COMPETITIVE NOW. I'M I'M I'M LIKE YOU IN THIS THAT WOULD THAT LOOK AT COST COST BUT BUT I YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER IN THE SENSE THAT- YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU RETAINING. THE BEST TALENT- AND ESPECIALLY AT THOSE CRITICAL POSITIONS- WORD IT YOU KNOW POLICY GETS IMPLEMENTED AND IT HAS RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES AND SOUL WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS I RAISE MY EYEBROWS. BUT I'M A SCIENCE. I LOOK AT. IN AND THEN THE DAY IS WHAT SPEED TO ME- SENT BATES. BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU KNOW NOT OUT OF. SAN OF THE CHANCELLOR'S HAD BASS SALARY THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW. THE ARE THE- HOW. AS A MATTER OF FACT GOD AT THE DATE THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS- SIX SOME. EIGHT AMONG BELOW THE TWENTY. PERCENT DOWN. EVEN AFTER THE RAISES THAT THAT WE VOTED TO GIVE THEM I'LL TELL YOU. THERE ARE STILL THREE THAT ARE BELOW THE THIRTIETH PERCENTILE AT THERE'S- AT THE- PERCENTILE IN THE REST ARE IN THE THIRTIETH PERCENTILE SO WE'RE BIG WILL WELL BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AND SO THERE WAS TALK ABOUT WHETHER. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD GIVE. SENATE YOUR. DO IN A E. L. I. A. CORRECTION- I HAVE. WE FELT IT WAS BEST JUST DO IT AT ONCE IT OVER WITH AND THEN KEEPING ON. FOR SOME OR ANOTHER IN PREVIOUS- THE CHANCELLOR SIR WERE NOT A- AND THIS IS WHY THEY ALL FELT. THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- OF PERCENTILE SAW CIVIL WELL DOES SEEM LIKE A LOT YOU LOOK AT THE- AT THE SCHOOLS- THAT ARE IN THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT THERE ARE. BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE ALL OF OUR CHANCES ARE IN SEOUL I THINK IT WAS- IT WAS NEEDED IT WAS NECESSARY IT'S A SIMPLE YET IT IS PAINFUL THAT ARE LARGE SALARY YES IT IS THE LARGE SIDE BUT YOU GET COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR- SPONSORS. PLEASE AND. DAHLE THAT THE MAN. I AM THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THEY MANAGE I IT'S A- WE COMPARE WILL TO A COUPLE OF RUNS A COMPANY SO. I THE SALARIES ARE IN LINE I AND AN I BELIEVE FOR IT BECAUSE I THERE DEFENSIBLE THE DATE SIXTEEN. AND HE AFTER DOUBLES IT'S STILL SPEAKS ME THAT DID RIGHT. WHAT YOU FOR THAT REASON AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF THE- COVERED. WHEN YOU'RE CITY ON ANY FOR VERY GOOD. TO DO IS THIS IS LEGIT WILL KEEP THE TALKED. WORKING FOR WHATEVER ON PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION THAT WE ARE ON A DECISION MAKER FOR I KNOW ON THE BORDERS TO PROVIDE. IN THE RECESSION WE ARE. TO PAY CUT BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T WE WOULD HAVE LOST PEOPLE AND VERY CRITICAL DEPARTMENT SO I WOULD HOLD. THE CHANCELLOR'S AT SOME POINT IN TIME IF WE EVER GET TO THAT HOPE WE DONT WOULD CONSIDER. A MAYBE TAKING- YOU KNOW MONEY WHERE THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR CHECK ON THAT MONEY WENT TO. HELP SOMEBODY A STUDENT OR SO I DO ON MY FINAL COMMENT ON IT IS I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING AFTER. THESE GET. TOUGH SORRY WHAT ARE MAY AND I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY CLOSE COMPARED TO. AND ACCOUNTED. WITHIN OUR HOUSE. BUT WITH. THANK YOU- FOR DOING A GREAT. THE DATA SHOW THAT. WITH THESE SALARY INCREASES WE WILL NOT HAVE A- ATTRACTING THE BEST IN THE- AND I THINK. ONE OF THE MEASURE THAT NEEDS BE AND- WHEN WE REVIEW SALARY. ARE WE HAVING A PROBLEM ATTRACTING THOSE PEOPLE DON'T THEY WANT TO COME TO CALIFORNIA. I WORK AT INCREDIBLE UNIVERSITY LIKE UCLA OR UC. AND SOME OF OUR BODY BE OUR COMPARATIVE DATA. THAT'S INVOVED WITH THE DECISIONS THAT GO TO. ARE THESE THESE SOME PRICE SALARIES BUT WITH THAT. YOU WILL HAVE MY VERY STRONG. SUPPORT FOR YOUR OUR CONFIRMATION AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE. PROFESSIONALLY AND NOW I'M CERTAINLY IN THE PUBLIC ARENA APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. THE BASIC CENTER COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND- THANK YOU MISTER HERNANDEZ FOR YOUR SERVICE I JUST HAVE. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU I THINK THAT- FOIL THE UC REGENTS. I HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN FRONT OF THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS THAT THE STATE HAS- YOU KNOW OVER THE WEEKEND I WAS AT AN EVENT AND INTRODUCED MYSELF TO THIS YOUNG WOMAN NAMED DELFINO. I WHOSE EIGHTEEN AND GETTING READY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO CALL. AND SHE SAID BERKELEY. AND I WAS OH MY GOODNESS WELL THANK GOODNESS YOU GOT IN AFTER ALL THE DRAMA THAT WE WERE HEARING ABOUT WITH THE HOUSING- AND SHE GIGGLED BUT IT DIDN'T. STAY IN MY MIND AND SO I WANTED TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT I WANTED TO KNOW FIRST. I'M IF YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S EFFORTS- I GUESS BERKELEY IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY- EXPAND THE ENTIRE UC SYSTEM. BUT IF YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S EFFORTS AROUND DEALING WITH FOOD INSECURITY- AND ALSO WITH STUDENT HOUSING. AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IF YOU WILL- RELATES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH BERKELEY AND MILLS COLLEGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- MILLS COLLEGE DECLARED A FINANCIAL EMERGENCY AND IT LAID OFF IN A NUMBER OF TENURED PROFESSORS- BECAUSE OF MULTIMILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALLS. AND ALSO ENROLLMENT DECLINES. IN SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU CAN PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON WHERE DISCUSSIONS ARE BETWEEN MILLS COLLEGE AND BERKELEY- BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP SO I'S A TWO PARTER I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA I'D USE BERKELEY AS THE GLUE. ONE IS AN UPDATE ON DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN MALES COLLAGEN BERKELEY AND THAT IS- YOUR SON HOW THE SCHOOL IS DOING A TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY AND HOUSING SHORTAGES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. YES I WILL WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW. D. AT THE SCHOOLS ARE ADDRESSING HOUSING INSECURITY WITH RESPECT TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF- OF HOUSING AVAILABLE DEBTS RAND BY THE UNIVERSITIES I JUST YESTERDAY I WAS AT UC SAN DIEGO I WITH CHANCELLOR KHOSLA AND NOW WE- VIEW- SEVERAL SEVERAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THEY'RE PUT UP. ONE HUNDRED I RESIDENTS UNIVERSITY ARE ARE ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR PART IN IN IN L. LEVI ATING THE- THE HOUSING AND SECURITY ISSUES NOW DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES OF THE TEN CAMPUSES. ARE UP ARE ABLE TO GROW IN DIFFERENT RATES SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED AT THE REALISTIC THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE SO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM- QUICKER THAN OTHERS BUT BUT I THINK EVENTUALLY WERE WE'RE GOING TO GET THEIR WORKERS SPECTRUM OOD INSECURITY. I MONTHS AGO I WAS AT UC- SANTA BARBARA VISITING UC SANTA BARBARA AND- AND I KNOW THAT FOOD IN SECURITY IS- IS A REAL ISSUE I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS- HAS HERE MARKED SOME MONIES SO THAT THEY GO TO THE SCHOOL SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED FOR FOOD AND. EVEN WHEN I TO UC SANTA I WENT INTO A CENTER CALLED AS- WERE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS CONGREGATE IN ME I UNIVERSITY HAS A PANTRY PROGRAM BUT YOU FOR THESE- MIKE ORGAN I AROUND THE CAMPUSES WERE LIKE AS SOON AND YOU KNOW RUN THEIR OWN WILL BLOW PATCH OUT PROGRAM WHERE THIS TO CAN THEY CAN SEE THEY CAN GROUPS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A PRINTER COMPUTER BUT THEY ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD AND SOLD IT'S THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THESE TYPE OF INITIATIVE. I HAD TO RE OF BETTER. TO ADDRESS THE ARE THESE NEW AND ARE ME IT'S ONLY GET BEFORE IT GETS SO THE YOU KNOW ARE TAKING A- ACT OF. WE'RE TO THE ISSUE OF A MILK YOU KNOW I JUST CAME ON IN AUGUST AND WE HAVE NOT DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE- DURING THE REGENTS MEETINGS BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ISSUE A WIN AT THE MILITARIZED MYSELF WELL WITH THEM BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE- YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OPPORTUNITIES THERE BUT BUT BUT- IF THEY'RE HAVING SO MUCH TROUBLE YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE FOR FUTURE EXPAND SO WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON. THE I MADE. MAY WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW I'M- I CAN'T CALM ON IT BECAUSE I AM NOT WITH THE SUBJECT IT IS NOT BEEN UP TO THE REGION'S ON AN AGENDA AN AGENDA ITEM. OKAY BUT YOU KNOW I'D APPRECIATE THAT- REST. MILLS IS A AT THE BELIEVE IT SING SAY. GENDER AND BERKELEY NOT SO WHEN YOU ASK JUST ADD THAT IN THERE ADD THAT LITTLE COMPLICATED MIX TO IT- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO BE WORKED OUT- IN A WAY THAT IS- BOTH ETHICAL AND- MAKES SENSE FOR THE- COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS WHO ARE THERE TO LEARN AND THE FOLKS THAT FACULTY WHO ARE THERE TO TEACH. MY QUESTION ACKERMAN. REALLY HAS TO DO ACTUALLY WITH- A RECENT DECISION THAT CAME DOWN FROM. THE REGIONS AS IT RELATES TO- UC MEDICAL CENTERS AND CATHOLIC HOSPITALS. WE KNOW THAT- YOU SEE SEVEN COLLABORATING WITH CATHOLIC HOSPITALS ON PATIENT CARE FOR SOME TIME AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE RATHER COMPLICATED- BECAUSE OF CONFLICTING VALUES I KNOW THAT A VOTE WAS TAKEN I GUESS IT WAS LAST YEAR IN JUNE. TO APPROVE NEWSSTAND GOVERNING THE UC AFFILIATIONS WITH THOSE HOSPITALS- AND OTHERS THAT IMPOSE. WRIST ON CARE AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS- AS IT RELATES TO MEDICAL DECISIONS. SO HAS THE UC DEVELOPED IN THE APPROPRIATE REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THIS POLICY IS SOLIDIFIED. HEY IT TO BE HONEST THE- THE ISSUE HAS NOT COME TO LIGHT IN TERMS OF IT BEING AN ISSUE I THINK- THE WAY WE'VE BEEN OPERATING HAS BEEN FINE AND IT HASN'T COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THERE IS A CONTROVERSY OR THAT WHATEVER POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS- IS NOT THE RIGHT POLICY- AND NOT COMING DOWN THE LINE HERE AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA. AFFECT THE- BUT- WITH RESPECT TO OUR IT BEING ISSUE I SEE BEING AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU'VE HEARD OF SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTERS ARE DOING AT THAT IS CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT THE CURRENT POLICY IS- I THINK THINGS ARE WORKING THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING AND NOW BACK TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CATHOLIC. CALPERS ODD THAT DONE LIKE YOU SAID I WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS THAT WHAT THEY JULY OR JUNE AND I CAME ON IN THE FALL SO AGAIN I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOLLOW UP ON SUBSEQUENT. REGENT MEETINGS. RIGHT THEY HAVE WAS IN JUNE AS A- OF SOME ISSUES- THAT. WERE- OBLA MATIC AND THE LEGISLATURE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING ACTION- RIGHT BEFORE- THE REGION'S TOOK THIS A VOTE AND SO IT WAS AS A IT WAS BECAUSE- THAT YOU SEE DOCTORS AND LOCAL STUDENTS THAT WERE PROVIDING CARE. INSIDE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS HAD TO ABIDE BY THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEM BUT THE CAPITALS AND IN MANY INSTANCES THAT MEANT- PROHIBITING ABORTIONS OR STERILIZATIONS OR CONTRACEPTION- SOME END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND ALSO GENDER AFFIRMATION SURGERY SO THE VOTE THAT WAS CARRIED OUT IN JUNE. WAS TO- SAY NO TO THAT BUT SUBSEQUENTLY POLICIES DO HAVE TO BE IN PLACE TO SOLIDIFY THAT VOTE THAT WAS TAKEN AND I THINK IT HAS SOME RELEVANCY NOW. IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED AT THE SUPREME COURT SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK THAT YOU ALSO PUT A PIN IN THAT QUESTION AS WELL- AND ADDS TO BEGIN TO HAVE. YOUR MEETING THE NEXT TIME YOU EAT I'M YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU TO COME WITH THEM UP UPDATED INFORMATION ON WHERE THE UC REGENTS ARE WITH SOLIDIFYING- OR CODIFYING THAT PARTICULAR VOTE. BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO VOTE ON IT AND THEN IT'S ANOTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR. THANK PAN AM PROTECTING THOSE ARE MY ONLY SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND REGION HERNANDEZ- MISTER HERNANDEZ I AM JUST SO IMPRESSED BY YOUR BACKGROUND AND YOUR RESUME YOUR STORY OF WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOUR FAMILY AND CAME CAN BE AND HOW YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN AND AEROSPACE AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING AND- THE ASTRONAUT HERE TO READ THAT YOU IT JUST IS REALLY VERY AN INSPIRING STORY AND- I AM GLAD TO SEE. THAT THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE LIKE YOU. I AM EXCITED BY IT IS BECAUSE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU QUOTED EARLIER BELIEVE HE SAID THAT WE GRADUATE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND. AND ENGINEERS ARE UNDERGRADUATE% ENGINEERS M. A. YEAR AND COMPARED TO CHINA AT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR INDIA THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO WITH YOUR INSPIRATIONAL STORY I MEAN. OTHER THAN DOING A SELF PROMOTIONAL VIDEO AS YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THE STEM AND SITE ANALOGY PROGRAMS. WHAT'S WHAT'S ON MAKING BURKE AND I KNOW IT ECHOES THAT THE QUESTION THAT I MIGHT THE VICE GRASS. AND ON MAKING. SURE THAT STUDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOWN. STILL FROM THE- VITAL IN THERE I MEAN YOU DEVELOP YOU SAID SOMETHING- EARLIER ABOUT MY ELIMINATES BREAST CANCER OR THAT DOES- YOU KNOW DID EFFECTIVELY CHANGES THE COURSE OF BREAST CANCER AND TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HOW EXCITING. AND SO- WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING MORE STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THAT EXCITEMENT. AND FIRSTHAND TECHNOLOGY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER ROSE- ONE WORD AND THAT IS OUT OF REACH- WE NEED TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THE UNIVERSITIES NEED TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO OUTRAGE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES DURING GAMES THE K. TWELVE PIPELINE THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR BUT THEN ALSO TO DEVELOP. THEM WERE PROGRAMS THAT BRINGS THE STUDENTS TO THE CAMPUS ALSO THAT THE STUDENTS CAN SCAN THEMSELVES IN THE CAMPUS THEY CAN ENVISION THEMSELVES- IN THE CAMPUS YOU KNOW I HAVE A I HAVE A PROGRAM THAT I MODELED AFTER PROGRAM EX'S FAULT EXPRESS BUT WE MODEL THAT WE REAP REPLICATED HERE AT UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC- I FOUNDATION DID REACHING FOR THE START OF THE SUMMER. WHAT WE BRING SEVENTH THROUGH FIFTH GRADERS ASSETS SEVENTY TWELFTH GRADERS. ON THE WEEK. OF LOS STEM PROGRAM HEY ON PROGRAM WITH PROJECTS AND THEN WE- STAY IN WITH THEM. THE YEAR EXPRESS PROGRAM OUR STUDENTS THAT STARTED IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND HE KEPT PARTICIPATING TO THE 12100% OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO COLLEGE. AND SO IT'S THESE TYPE OF RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE OUR OWN IN THE ACT AT THESE PROGRAMS SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THEM SO IT'S ENGAGING WITH THE KIDS AT A YOUNG AGE- BUT- FORTUNATE THINGS RESOURCES- BUT I THINK IF THE- CAP. IS WORK SMARTWAY WHICH NOT CREATE THE STEP- AND WITH A FOCUS IN STEM SO SOULS SO AND I'M ALL FOR LEAD THE CHARGE THEY WANT HELP UP THEY WANT TO MODEL IT AFTER WHAT. OUR LESSONS LEARNED YEAH DON'T. HELLO THE L. SOMETHING LIKE THAT OKAY ALL THE CAMP. OF OUR I UNIVERSITY CAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR THE I FORWARD TO SOME YOUR CO. THANK VERY MUCH IT'S THANK YOU SENATOR GROW OUR LET ME A SENATOR LOW- AS THE- ALSO THE RULE COMMITTEE MEMBER BUT THE CHAIR OF BUDGETS ONE TO CLOSE US OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- MMHM I. NORMALLY WHEN I CHAIR SUB ONE BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY HEARINGS IN JANUARY AND MARCH I WAS MAKE LIGHT OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE WITNESSES AND I THINK I KNOW BETTER THAN TO DO THIS ONE BECAUSE THERE'S A ROCKET AN ASTRONAUT SUIT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A PICTURE OF AN ASTRONAUT CLASS OF HEALTH AND SO. I WOULD JUST NOTE FROM THE OUR MEETING I HAD WITH YOU AND ACTUALLY THE MEETING AFTERWARDS WITH THE TO CSU TRUSTEES WERE AMONG THE BEST ONE I'VE HAD WITH POTENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE WELL ON THE RULES COMMITTEE AND I THINK THAT. ARE YOUR STORY IS POWERFUL YOU'RE- TRULY QUALIFIES YOU. AND MOST OF THE COLLEAGUES OF- I HAVE ASKED A LOT OF THE THINGS I'VE WANTED TO SO LET ME MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN MAYBE ASK A QUESTION. AND THE COMMENTS WERE ON SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. AND BOB WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR BATES ASKED WITH REGARD TO THE SALARIES OF CHANCELLOR'S I KNOW THAT WE TALKED TO THE- THE PRESIDENT THE UNIVERSITY AND HE DID A SIMILAR THING THAT YOU JUST DID WHAT SHE CITED THE SALARY STUDY. AND I PROJECTS REMINDED HIM THAT THERE WILL BE SALARY STUDIES FOR EVERY OTHER LEVEL AND I HOPE YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OTHER SALARY STUDIES. OF THAT ARE DONE WITHIN. THE CAMPUS AS WELL THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD. AND I THINK SENATOR COM LONGER ASKED ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX AND THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WE MIGHT. MEET WITH YOU AND BRING YOU UP TO SPEED BECAUSE IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE HOSPITALS AND RICHARD PEREZ- NEGOTIATED A SOLUTION THAT THE REGENTS ADOPTED IN LIEU OF A BILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO JUST. MAKE IT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME ON AFTER SOME OF THAT HAPPENED AND IT WOULD BE GOOD TO MAKE SURE.% YOU'RE UP TO SPEED. A. N. ON MILLS COLLEGE I THINK MANY OF US IN PARTICULAR ON THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. WE'RE LOOKING AT EXACTLY THE PROBLEM THAT SENATOR CALM WATER REFERENCED WITH REGARD TO ENROLLMENT. BAND THE- AND WE END OUR CONVERSATION TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS JUST BEEN JAMMING EVERY EXTRA STUDENT INTO THE EXISTING FORTY PRINT DINNER NEEDS TO BE A LONG TERM PLAN AND ONE OF THE PLANS WAS IF MILLS ON ITS OWN ON THE DECISION OF MILLS COLLEGE DECIDED TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS THAT WAS A READY MADE CALL CAMPUS TO CORPORATION TO. RECORDING ENTER AND CAPACITY FOR MOMENT AND I THINK THAT'S- R. WHERE THAT STOOD. AND GIVEN THE FACT EVERYBODY ASKED EVERYTHING DIFFERENT TERM. ON YOUR INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES AND JUST ASK YOU- HOW IS YOUR OWN STORY GOING TO INFORM YOU WHEN YOURS SITTING HERE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT ACCESS AND KEPT IT. AND HOW APPLIED THE UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IS OUR HOW WAS THAT EXPERIENCE CAN INFORM YOU AS A REJECTED AND WHAT YOUR ACTIONS ARE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH US A SIMILAR FOR THAT- INSIGHTFUL QUESTION AND YOU KNOW I I'VE BEEN A BLESSED MAN SENATOR IN THE SENSE THAT- I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SAID HAD CERTAIN DOORS OPEN CERTAIN PEOPLE MENTORS HELPED ME ALONG THE WAY AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR WHEN I FIRST WORKED AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB AFFIRMING. ACTION DIVERSITY OFFICE- THE MY DEPARTMENT WAS ENDING PAIN FOR MYSELF WHEN THEY WERE GIVING ME FREE OF CHARGE- BECAUSE- IT WAS THE SPECIAL PROGRAM TO ALLOW- PEOPLE OF COLOR TO COME INTO THE LAB AND WORK AS A SUMMER STUDENT. HAD THAT PROGRAM NEVER EXISTED I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD BEEN ABLE TO SET MY FOOT. ON AT THE NATIONAL LAB AND DO THE GOOD WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HERE THE PROJECT THAT I'M MOST PROUD OF- IS DEVELOPING THAT FULL FIELD DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY SYSTEM FOR EARLIER DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER- AN INCREDIBLE DEVICE THAT HAS SAVED. THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES SO AS I SIT IN MY POSITION A A REGION- YOU CAN REST ASSURE SENATOR THAT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT- IN IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT DOOR OPEN SO THAT THE STUDENTS GIVING THEM.

AND DURING THAT TIME I WORKED WITH EDUCATORS ADVOCATES COMMUNITY GROUPS SUPPORTERS SEPARATELY ANDERS- THE GAMUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO INCREASING COLLEGE ACCESS ACCESS. AND SUCCESS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE ONE THING THAT IS REALLY CLEAR WHEN YOU DO THIS IS HOW CENTRAL. ZERO SHE WAS THE CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TO WHICH FUTURE ECONOMIC VITALITY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CSU GRADUATES ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF PROFESSIONAL HUMAN CAPITAL IN CALIFORNIA HANFORD TEACHERS ENGINEERS NURSES OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUSINESS LEADERS AB PUBLIC SERVICE PROFESSIONALS LEGISLATORS. ANY ROOM THAT YOU GO INTO IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HE HAS COME IN YOUR US YES YOU WILL BE SURPRISED HOW MANY PEOPLE RAISE THEIR HANDS. THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS YEAR IS A IS ALSO THE END FOR IN. ECONOMIC AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN THE STATE WERE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS TODAY. ARE CATEGORIZED AS SOCIAL ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE THEY NEED CSU AS A LADDER FOR UP FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. I CARE HOW CSU WORKS OUT FULFILLS ITS MISSION ALAMEDA ITS COMMITMENTS TO ITS STUDENTS AND ALL OF ITS STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE INTERESTING. I WANT TO BE PART OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT I WANT TO HELP ME TO CHALLENGES AND TAKE ADVANTAGES. OF ALL THE OPERA. SO WHAT DO I BRING TO THE APPOINTMENT- HELLO FOR MY RESUME BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE BY TRAINING AND THIS POSITION ON A POLICY WONK. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING OTHER THINGS SO MUCH. I WAS A THE YEAH FOR I CAN IT WILL UPDATE I LOVE ANALYZE PROBLEMS FROM LOVED ABOUT BEING OUT. BUT IN MY HEART I'M A PROBLEMS. AND I LIKE TO MAKE A TO HAVE A MAKE AN IDEA BECOME A REALITY. YOU TAKE A GOOD. SOLUTIONS AND HELP DELIVER ON ITS PROMISES. I KNOW IT WOULD TAKE SOME THINGS IN OUR- I WOULD A LARGE PROBABLY AGENCY AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS. AND WITHOUT THE TEAM TO IMMODEST I THINK BOTH PLACES WERE BETTER OFF WHEN I LEFT AND WHEN I STARTED. THIS FINALLY ON A PERSONAL I THOUGHT OF HIM AS HE- BUT IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS I'VE MET OVER THE- I AM NOT THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. I'M AN IMMIGRANT. AND COLUMBIA WERE I'M FROM COLLEGE WAS FOR BORDERS NOT FOR GIRLS GIRLS ARE JUST SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED. I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FIFTEEN WITH MY MOTHER MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER. I GUESS STARNES REALLY ALWAYS SAID I SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE. BUT I JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. I ENROLLED IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL I WANT TO A COUNSELOR AND HE WAS NOT HEALTH. BUT FORTUNATELY THERE ARE OTHER DON'T INCLUDING A TEACHER WILL MEAN DIED MY WAY INTO COLLEGE. MONEY WAS ALWAYS ISSUE. MY EDUCATION WAS PAID FOR BY SCHOLARSHIPS WORK STUDY SUMMER JOBS LOANS I WONDER HOW MY GOING TO GIVE ME AND IT'S REALLY THAT START IN LIFE VENTURA I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY NOW THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND IDEALLY BETTER ONES FOR THE CURRENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION. CALIFORNIANS FOR FOUR DAYS YOUR AND HAVING A GOOD DISCUSSION THIS THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- FOR SHARING THAT WITH US A TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FIRST- I WANT TO GIVE GRATITUDE- TO MY MEXICAN IMMIGRANT PARENTS WHO INSTILLED IN ME THE VALUE HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE- MY FATHER IS FROM THE TRUCK GUN AND MY MOTHER IS FROM FORTY PEOPLE AND- I KNOW THAT MY MOTHER IS WATCHING AND MY FATHER IS WATCHING FROM HEAVEN AS WE LOST HIM AND- HE- MY HUSBAND- IS JOINING US TO- ONLINE AND- HE IS THE CFO OF. A FRESNO EOC- I'M ALSO A PROUD CSU ALONG AS MYSELF. AND MY CHILDREN JULIET'S AND THE SETS ARE IN SCHOOL BUT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS FOR THEIR FUTURES. I WAS BORN IN REDWOOD CITY AND I MOVED TO TULARE COUNTY AS A YOUNG PERSON. I UP I ASSURE MY APPRECIATION AND ALSO TO OUR GOVERNOR WHO. WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS AN APPOINTMENT FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND REPRESENTED ON THIS BOARD. THIS AGREEMENT HAS SUCH INCREDIBLE SIGNIFICANCE TO ME AND MY HIGHER EDUCATION EDUCATION EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT WAS SO MEANINGFUL MY PARENTS SUPPORTED AND VALUED HIGHER EDUCATION BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANEUVER THE SYSTEM. I AM A FIRST GENERATION GRADUATE WHO NEEDED THE COLLEGE READINESS SUPPORTS AND THERE WASN'T COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS AT MY SCHOOL. I'M OR CANCERS TO SUPPORT ME- BUT CSU FRESNO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ENGAGED- I WAS A TRANSFER STUDENT AND BECAUSE OF. THE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD OF MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE I WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER- AND BE A BUSINESS MAJOR AT CSU FRESNO. AS A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. AND AFTER WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES IN THE NONPROFIT AND HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE NEED THAT MANY STUDENTS ENCOUNTER. THROUGH THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEYS- WITHOUT THE SUPPORT WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE- IT'S JUST CRUCIAL FOR US AS A SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE. PATHWAYS FOR OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ATTAIN THEIR EDUCATION. ONLY UNTIL I KNEW HOW TO MANEUVER THAT SYSTEM DID I BRING OTHERS ALONG WITH ME MY SISTERS MY COUSINS MY FRIENDS AND THEN MY MOM. WHO ENTERED AS A REENTRY STUDENT IN HER FIFTIES I'M SO PROUD OF HER. PURSUING IT. CATION WAS SO MEANINGFUL BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO OPEN DOORS FOR OTHERS- EQUITABLE COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FOR PEOPLE IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE IS IMPORTANT TO ME WHICH INCLUDES STREAMLINING PROCESSES FOR OUR STUDENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PATHWAYS ARE OPEN FOR RESTORATION LOW INCOME HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED STUDENTS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. STUDENT SUCCESS OF THE TOP PRIORITY FOR ME. WHEN ALL CSU STUDENTS DESERVE A QUALITY EDUCATION WITH INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING TO PREPARE THEM FOR AN EVER EVOLVING WORKFORCE. I KNOW THIS IS A REAL I'M CRUCIAL TIME TO BE- AND APPOINT AN APPOINTED PERSON I KNOW THAT IS A JOURNEY THAT I DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY- I FEEL THAT BURDEN WHEN I GO AND VISIT THE CAMPUSES I'VE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO VISIT FIVE CAMPUSES TO MEET WITH STUDENTS- AND I KNOW THAT I AM READY FOR THE CHALLENGE AND IF CONFIRMED I WILL. WORK EXTREMELY HARD TO REPRESENT OUR STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS THAT WAS- I THINK WE'VE INCREDIBLE STORIES AND- COMMENTS TODAY FROM SOME INCREDIBLE APPOINTMENTS- LET ME AGAIN START WITH OUR VICE CHAIR AND WILL WILL GO THAT WAY GOD AS WE DID BEFORE AND I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TWO TRUSTEES WITH US SO YOU CAN EITHER DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO A PARTICULAR TRUSTEE. OR YOU CAN ASK BOTH TRUSTEES- TO RESPOND I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE TO THE SENATOR TO DECIDE. MINUTEMAN VICE CHAIR THANK YOU. I'M I THINK YOU I'M M. PROTEOMIC ONDO THANK YOU BOTH ON THIS LOCALES MISS RODRIGUEZ SOPH OBVIOUSLY THE PASSION FOR YOUR JOB AND YOUR APPOINTMENT TO COME THROUGH AND ACTUALLY- PUTS A LITTLE LUMP IN A COUPLE OF OUR THROAT FIGHTING CODE TO SEE THE PASSION THAT FAIR AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE IN A USER DIFFICULT TIME SO CERTAINLY IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING WITH HOUSING AND FOOD AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH ENOUGH WHAT IS IT FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS AND ALL OF THAT OUT FULL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOU DO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN. MIND PROBABLY RELATES TO THE- TO BE A YEAR. THAT I WAS IN CALL. IN TRY TO GET IN HIGH SCHOOL GET TO CALL. THAT WAS GOAL AND YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T OUT FOR YOU. TO GO TO TRADE SCHOOL AND MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A BAD IDEA ABOUT TIME ANYWAY. I KNOW ELEKTRISCHE AND WAS MAKING TWICE AS MUCH AS FRIEND OF MINE WHO'D GONE AND GOTTEN HIS MASTER'S DEGREE SO. IF IF THE DIFFERENT TIME HOWEVER AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT. THE ELIMINATION OF THE FAT AND ASKED FOR ADMISSIONS- WONDERING. YOU ASSESS IT. STUDENTS AND THEY'RE READYNAS LET'S TALK ABOUT MATURITY AND READY ENOUGH. FOR YOU KNOW JUMPING FROM HIGH SCHOOL INTO. WHAT'S REALLY VERY DEMANDING SCHEDULE IN YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR. AND I THINK THE MOST DEMORALIZING THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO. FIRST YEAR OF STUDENT IN COLLEGE IS THEY DON'T MAKE IT AND THAT HAPPENED TO A FEW OF- I WOULDN'T SAY FRIENDS BUT COLLEAGUES WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR THEY JUST THEY JUST THEY WE WERE TAKING THE SAT AT THAT TIME BUT- NOT TO DEBATE THAT JUST. GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW YOU DO A SELF AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE STUDENTS THAT MAYBE NEED THAT AFTER SUPPORT. WHAT IS ART WHAT ARE OUR- UNIVERSITIES PROVIDING AND ARE THEY PROVIDING SOMETHING SO THAT THEY CAN CATCH THOSE LIKE THE SAFETY NET I GUESS IS WHAT I'M TALKING. BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE. THAT THAT THERE'S SOME PLANNING AND OUT TO ENSURE THAT. SOMEONE DOESN'T YOU KNOW DROP OUT- FILTERS THEME AGAIN IS FULL SO VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT AGE RANGE SO. WELL AND THAT QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF YOU I'M SURE YOU BOTH HAVE. A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK YOU ARE TRUSTEE LOPEZ WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST THIS TIME AND THEN WE'LL GO TO MS RODRIGUEZ AND WE'LL SWITCH IT UP NEXT TIME. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M PORTANT QUESTIONS- I THINK IT'S A G. F. AS A TEASE- HAVE BEEN A PART OF A- COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND QUESTIONS FOR SO LONG I AND- BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE LEARNED THAT THE S. A. T. SENATE ISSUE. S. AND THE. A. C. T. IT'S- REALLY A SENSE THAT BEING. AS GOOD PREDICTORS OF COLLEGE SUCCESS AS THEY ONCE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THEY WERE NOT THE LEVELLERS IF YOU WILL. OF THE MERIT LEVELERS OF THEY WERE UP HOW DID TO BE. AND IN FACT WHAT HAPPENED- OVER TIME IS THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN PARTICULAR GROUPS FROM A LOWER INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. WERE REALLY ARE NOT DOING THAT WELL AND IN A SENSE EXACERBATING. INEQUITIES IN COLLEGES AND- THE BEST PREDICTOR OF HOW STUPID WILL DO IN COLLEGE REALLY IS FOR HIGH SCHOOL- RECORD FOR HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS AND HOW THEY DO. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW WITH THE CSU AS YOU KNOW WE DID A WOMAN LIKE THE SAT AND- IN THE A. C. T. I. IT ALONE IT. WILL AT THE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL- DATA TRANSFERS THE THREE G. COMPLETE COMPLETIONS AND THEN TO YOUR POINT THERE IS THE ADMISSION PROCESS FROM THEN THE PLACEMENT PROCESS HOW. HOW DOES THE SCHOOL NO. WHERE THAT STUDENT WIDELY BE BEST PLACE FOR THEY REALLY SHOULD SO THEY DON'T. SO THE THEY DON'T OF. FIND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE OBSTACLES OF EITHER MATH OR ENGLISH WHICH OF THE TWO- SORT OF GATEWAY COURSES. OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS MULTIPLE WAYS OF ASSESSING THAT. ARE SOME OF THEM ARE STILL STANDARDIZED TEST OF THE STUDENT TAKES A STANDARDIZED TEST THE GOVERNMENT OR USE THAT. BUT IF YOU WERE TO GO TO THEIR WEBSITE YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM THERE THAT ENTERING STUDENTS CAN USE TO ASSESS AND TO SORT OF SEE WHERE THE PLACE. AND THEN BASED ON THE SELF ASSESSMENT THEY CAN THINK AND TALK TO THEIR GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND THEN THEY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF ARCHED OF SCORING THE CLASSES WITH. WERE STRONG COLLEGE IN THE SUMMER BEFORE OR DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES THIS. THE MAIN OF WITH THE KERN WITH THE- IS DOING IS. THEY SPEND THE MOST LASSEN. SO YEAH OUR- THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M YES I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS A SYSTEM IS BE PREPARED TO ASSIST THOSE STUDENTS- FOR THEIR PLACEMENT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE- PART OF THE MULTI FACTOR MISTER PROCESS- IS TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW BASED ON THEIR FORCES LIKE- ADDRESSING OF THE SAID BASED ON THEIR GPA- THAT IF THEY NEED TO ENROLL IN WHAT'S CALLED AN EARLY START PROGRAM THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THAT PROGRAM IN THE SUMMER. PRIOR TO THEM ATTENDING IN THE FALL AND ALL OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES ACTUALLY OFFER THAT EARLY START PROGRAM AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP COLLEGE RIGHT READY MISS BEFORE THEY ENROLL IN SCHOOL WHICH I THINK IS CRUCIAL- I FEEL YOU KNOW MY STORY BEING FROM A RURAL COMMUNITY AND ON A SMALLER SCHOOL THAT THE NECESSARY. RESOURCES I WHAT- INFORMED OR PREPARED EVEN SHARED WHEN THE- OR ACT DEAD WORST I DIDN'T GET TO TAKE THAT. THEM THROUGH THE WAS MY STORY AND I KNOW THAT MANY- STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE A PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE THAT. SO AS A SYSTEM WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE IN PLACE SO THAT THE STUDENTS ARE JUST READY TO GO WHEN THEY START IN THE FALL. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW TO THE QUESTION ON BOTH OF YOU CONFIDANTE WHEN I SAW IT IT WAS TROUBLING ON JUST KNOWING A FEW RELATE TO KIDS GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN SOMETIMES THEY'RE JUST NOT READY RIGHT. AND ON THAT SAME THING AS WE MATURE ALONG THE WAY FROM SOME ARE VERY SMART BUT MAYBE NOT READY FOR THE PRESSURES THAT COME. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DO HAVE. AN ATTENTION TO THAT AND CERTAINLY ARE WITHOUT EARLY START I WOULD SAY THAT FOR. MAYBE A SAFETY NET. THAT FOR THEIR FIRST BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE AN ISSUE ONCE THEY'RE THERE I JUST ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW- ON. THEIR ON THE IMPROVING THE GRADUATION RATES FOR FRESHMEN AND RANSFER STUDENTS HAS REALLY BEEN AN INITIATIVE IN THE FOLK OF. THAT MY STAFF INFORMATION TELLS ME THERE'S STILL GAPS IN THE BUDGET WITH ACTION RATES FOR LOW INCOME. AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS THOUGHT YOU'VE PERSISTING IN QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU AGAIN ON ARE WE FOCUSING ON THAT IN IN ON TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT. WITH CUTTING OUT WHAT THE GAP IS THAT MIGHT GO TO THE READY NOW AGAIN OR OR WHAT SCHOOL TO COME OUT OF WHAT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE KIND. OF IN THERE THEY HAD THE IN DEPTH- IN IN ENGLISH OR- MATH THIRTY NEEDED BUT- HERE'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ ONE OF YOU A- SOFTENED WILL GO BACK TO TWO MISS LOPEZ. I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I. AM REALLY ME SURE I WAS A OF AND- HAS IN. PEOPLE I START. ON SEVEN EIGHT MONTHS AGO- IS- SEES FIVE POINT THAT. THERE PRACTICES SUPPORTS A RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS THAT NEED THAT ADDITIONAL HELP. SO THAT WE CAN HELP THEM GRADUATE. ON TIME. AND AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THERE'S DEFINITELY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE. TO HELP THEM- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS- LIKE OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS MAKING SURE THAT WE RE ENGAGE- ARE UNDER UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT POTENTIALLY STOPPED OUT. BECAUSE OF CODE I MEAN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY MAKE SURE- IS- TOP OF MIND FOR US TO. ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO RE ENROLL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M REALLY PROUD TO- TO EITHER. IS THAT IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE JUST MAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT- OF PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO. REACH OUT TO THOSE I. JUST IF YOU BAKER SPILLED AND THE- WITH ME HOW. THEY ARE DOING THIS REALLY INTENSIVE- COUNCIL APPROACH ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THOSE STUDENTS- AND MAKE SURE THAT THE GET BACK INTO THE SYSTEM SO THEY CAN GET BACK ON TRACK. AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PROCESS IS AYE IS THERE ANY OTHER BARRIERS ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS FOR THE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO- A TEEN- THEIR GRADUATION ON TIME. AND WE NEED TO REVISE THOSE AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES ARE DOING THAT- AND AS I GO TO THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES I ASKED THEM. ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND- THEY ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CREATING THESE. PIECES FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES- WHICH I THINK IS VALUE APPLE AND REALLY A- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I THE JUST THAT WITH PROCEDURE WAS I WAS SPEAKING TO. UNDERSCORE THE EQUITY CLOSING THOSE EQUITY GAPS IS THE MAJOR FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. I IN ADDITION TO THE THINGS THAT THE TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ A JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER- OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT I THINK WILL HELP SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SENATE POST SOME OF THESE EQUITY GAS. ONE OF HIS SONS UNDER SOME SOME UNIVERSITIES SOME CAMPUSES ARE DOING REALLY WELL AND OTHERS NOT SO WELL AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SYSTEM IS ORGANIZING IS IN A SENSE SUPPORT GROUPS ON LEARNINGS FROM EACH OTHER. WHAT WORKED IN ONE CAMPUS WHAT WERE THE LESSONS THERE HOW CAN THEY APPLIED IN ANOTHER IN ANOTHER CAMPUS SO THEY'RE BEGINNING TO SHARE. LESSONS LEARNED AND WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND HOPEFULLY. ROOF ACROSS THE SYSTEM. I THINK ALL THE CAMPUSES ARE IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT EFFECTIVE TRUSTED REVIEWS THAT ARE DOING THINGS LIKE IDENTIFYING IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ARE THE COURSES ONE OF THE COURSES THAT ARE IN RECENT SURVEY LANG IN LARGE NUMBERS WHY ARE THEY FAILING IN LARGE NUMBERS TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE PEDAGOGY IS OF THIS OF COURSE YOU KNOW REALLY TAKING A GOOD HARD LOOK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS IT ISN'T THAT IT'S THE STUDENTS FAULT OF THEIR FAILING IS THAT THEY HAVE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS AND MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING BUT AT THE SAME TIME ADJUSTING TO MEET WITH THE STUDENTS ARE AT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING TO GET TO HOLDING SOME OF THOSE EQUITY GAPS IS STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS ABOUT THE COLLEGES CRUSHER IS MISSING AND I SPEAK FOR MYSELF. AS WELL MY MOTHER DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE. YOU KNOW YOU GO COLLEGE ANY JUST ARE SORT OF WHY. AROUND YOU KNOW AND NOW WE HAVE PATHWAY. AND WE HAVE A TO TELL STUDENTS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO EVERY YEAR AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS COLLEGES RETURN UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING IS. SCHEDULING SO THAT THERE ARE CLASSES. AVAILABLE SO THEY CAN MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS SO THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. ARE VERY ON ACROSS THE CAMPUSES. WE HAVE WORK TO DO THERE'S IMPROVEMENT TO BE DONE TO BE DONE BUT I CAN SAY THAT IN IN THE TIME TAT I'VE BEEN- ON THE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ON THE REPORTS SO WE FOR. THERE'S A REAL COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. LIKE WITH THE- AS FAR AND RE THOSE. THANK YOU FOR THOSE OF COMMENTS A BOTH ON ARE ACTUALLY READ. SIDE T BE ON THOSE BOARDS IN TERMS OF YOUR OWN BACKGROUND IN AGAIN YOUR COMMITMENT TO EACH AND EVERY STUDENTS WOULD. BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ON THEIR FOUR YEAR FIVE YEAR SIX YEAR. DEGREE AND BE OUT IN THE WORLD- CONTRIBUTING AND CERTAINLY OF BEING ON THEIR THEIR CAREER PATHS THANK YOU AND YOU WILL BOTH HAVE MY STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAMVICE HERE LET ME TURN TO SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MA'AM PRO TEM I'M GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY COME BEFORE US- I DO I WOULD LIKE TO START- WITH MISS RODRIGUEZ. AT THE END THE ONLY REASON I'M STARTING WITH YOU MISS RODRIGUEZ IS BECAUSE I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR PICK SOMEBODY FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS OFTEN OVER OVERLOOKED. AND WE ARE YOU KNOW WHERE THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD. AND WE PRODUCE 70% OF THE FUEL AND 58% OF THE- RENEWABLE ENERGY AND I JUST THINK IT'S- A GOOD MOVE TO PUT SOMEBODY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ON THIS BOARD SO THAT- WE HAVE REPRESENTATION AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US IS VALLEY RESIDENTS MAKING SURE THAT. A LOT OF OUR KIDS HAVE PATHWAYS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. SO HAVING THAT IN MIND- YOUR OPINION ON OUT CS YOU CAN BETTER SERVE. THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS SUCH AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY I MEAN. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE ON THE BOARD GIVING YOUR FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF- THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND US IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AREA AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO EXPAND THEIR REACH TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR GROWN ON. ARE YOU PROUD TO BE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IT'S HAS GIVEN SO MUCH TO ME- AND THAT THROUGHOUT- MY- YOUTH AND ALSO NOW IN MY CAREER. I WILL TELL YOU THAT WORKING WITH- STUDENTS- FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE. I'M ON. THEIR JOURNEYS OF TRYING TO ATTAIN HIGHER EDUCATION. I AM HARD OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE SEEN. IS THIS COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS COMPONENT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I SYSTEMS THAT WE TRULY HELP OUR STUDENTS TO BE PREPARED AND READY FOR COLLEGE- AND THAT ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER TO DO THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE- BEEN STRESSING IS. REALLY WE NEED TO TRY TO CREATE THIS CULTURE A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN IF IT'S NOT A TRADITION AND THEIR FAMILIES AND HOW DO WE DO THAT. I SHARED WITH- SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES THAT TRULY YOU KNOW GETTING YOUR EDUCATION AND MAKING THAT DECISION IS REALLY A FAMILIAL DECISION. SO OW ARE WE AS INSTITUTIONS MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THIS- FAMILY ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT BURKE YOU KNOW OUR PARENTS ARE A PART OF THE PROCESS- WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT THEY ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE FOR ME. YOU HAVE- IN. FROM THE COLLEGE TO WALK WITH MY PARA. ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANT A TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID AND TO DO THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS- MY FIRST WORK STUDY JOB WAS FINANCIAL AID. OFFICE I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WORK IN THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE WHICH WAS AMAZING. BECAUSE I ACTUALLY USED THAT SKILL SET THE HELP ANYONE AROUND ME TO HELP THEM KNOW HOW TO FILL OUT THAT APPLICATION I GAVE WORKSHOPS IN SPANISH AND- IT ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO JUST TRY TO ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW MORE OF OUR STUDENTS. YOU KNOW TO- TO GO FOR THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION SO. THERE REALLY IS WE HAVE TO THINK CREATIVELY AND INNOVATIVELY TO SAY HOW DO WE MAKE THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE. TO THEM TO OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO KNOW THAT WITH MANY OF OUR DIFFERENT CULTURES THAT ARE IN AND WE'RE STILL CULTURALLY RICH. US SENATE APPROVED YOU KNOW THIS- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SPACES AVAILABLE FOR THEM. TO KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. THANK YOU MA'AM I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. I MISS LOPEZ. YOU KNOW ME UNITED STATES MILITARY VETERAN AND WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILITARY FAMILIES- THAT ARE CONNECTED TO OUR STUDENTS- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE- ON CAMPUSES TO FOSTER PROMOTE SUPPORTIVE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS MIGHT BE DEPLOYED. SO THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION ARSENE'S THAT IN SOME OF THE OTHER COLLEGES OR VISIT US ON THE UNIVERSITIES ARE VISITED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THEIR CENTERS FOR VETERANS AND VETERANS SERVICES BUT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DEPENDENCE AND I HAVE TO ADMIT ARE A WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ARE A I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY NOW THAT I CAN% ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NO THAT'S OKAY. I THANK YOU MA'AM I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL AND EVEN SOMETHING ANYTHING. THANK YOU. BUT I DO AM I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU ACCEPTING THIS NOMINATION AND BEING A PART OF THIS INTERVIEW PROCESS AND- I THINK YOU'RE BOTH VERY VERY WELL. QUALIFIED LIKE I SAID I'M EXCITED THAT MISS RODRIGUEZ COMES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. N. AND MISS LOPEZ NO NO OFFENSE MEANT WHATSOEVER BUT YOU REMIND ME OF MY GRANDMOTHER WITH AN IRON FIST. THAT IS GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE AROUND HER INCLUDING HER GRANDCHILDREN ARE SUCCESSFUL AND I HOPE THAT YOU A- HAVE A LOT OF ADOPTED GRANDCHILDREN IN THAT THE UC SYSTEM THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT IS A COMP OKAY GOOD THING YOU SENATOR GROVE- SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM IT'S TOUGH TO NOT WANT TO COMMENT ON AND SO WAYS. BUT OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO- IT HAS I SAID DURING- ARE HEARING OF THE U. REGENT I THOUGHT THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD. IN WITH HIM IN ADVANCE WERE AMONG SOME OF THE BEST DISCUSSIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH. WITH POTENTIAL CANDIDATESHERE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE AND I THINK EXPANDING ON WHAT SENATOR GROVE SAID. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ALL THREE OF THE CANDIDATES OR FROM AN IMMIGRANT BACKGROUND AND THAT TOO FAR FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT I THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. WOULD HAVE BEEN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO BAND. ARE IT IS A GREAT THING HERE TODAY AND THE THING I WANTED TO EXPLORE A LITTLE AND WE HAD A VERY DETAILED TALK CURRENT EVENTS AT THE CSU SYSTEM RIGHT NOW HAVE NOT BEEN. TOTALLY PLEASANT AND I THINK THAT. THAT WHETHER IT IS OF THE CURRENT EVENTS IN CHOOSING A NEW CHANCELLOR. OR THE OPERATIONS AND THE LABOR AGREEMENTS MAKING SURE THAT SOMEBODY IS LOOKING OVER THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THE LABOR AGREEMENTS ARE DONE IN A WAY. THAT IS FAIR AND WORKS FOR PEOPLE OR THE GRADUATION RATES BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A PROGRAM THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BUT IT'S NOT THERE YET. TO WEAR THE GOALS WERE MET AND MY QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT I HAVE KNOWN JULIO LOPEZ SAID SHE WAS ARE LEGISLATIVE STAFFER. THE BOMB HOW DO YOU AND WE'LL START WITH WITH TRUSTEE LOPEZ AND THEN GO TO TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ. HOW DO YOU AS TRUSTEES. R. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ACTUALLY IMPACT THESE ISSUES HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DRESSED SORT OF AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND OFFERING OPINIONS HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE. THAT DID YOU IMPACT THE OPERATIONS IN IMPACT THESE ISSUES AND REALLY HELP CSU ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK WE'LL STARTWITH WITH TRUSTEE LOPEZ. THANK YOU CENTER RUMORED AS YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A VERY VERY. GREAT DISCUSSION WE MET. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOARD IS THE GOVERNING BODY. HE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO REALLY ASK. CRITICAL QUESTIONS. INTO ISSUES TO ENSURE THE WHEN PROPOSALS COME TO THE STAFF WE ACTUALLY ARE NOT ESSENTIALLY EXPECTED TO APPROVE BUT THAT WE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE WHAT THE PROS AND THE CONS ARE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND TERMS OF HOW THE BOARD OPERATES- AND PERHAPS FOR THE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE COMMITTEES AND THE BOARD STRUCTURES ON THE SOFA AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY DIG INTO THOSE BIG ISSUES THAT AFFECT. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WE'VE GOTTEN REPORTS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE I SUSPECT THAT WE CAN HAVE IN TERMS OF HEARINGS OR- COMMITTEE MEETINGS. WITH THE STAFF THERE REALLY PRO AND UNDERSTAND AND THEN SUGGEST HOW WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE OR DON'T KNOW ESSENTIALLY A GOOD WAY. HOW CAN WE DO BETTER AND HOW CAN WE HELP THEM GET BETTER- AT THE IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL- THE LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE NEGOTIATED. BUT I THINK AT THE BOARD LEVEL AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT HAS COME UP BEFORE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOING FAIR LABOR AGREEMENT SO THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. END TO THE EARLIER DISCUSSION WITH YOU SEE ABOUT SALARIES THAT THE SALARIES ARE ALL ACROSS ALL THE WAY DOWN UP AND DOWN THE LINE. YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING WE CERTAINLY HAVE OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING UP. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SALARY STUDY FOR STAFF AND A SALARY STUDY FOR FACULTY WE WANT TO BRING SOME EQUITY ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. IT'S NOT JUST. THE PRESIDENT'S. OR THE FACULTY OR THE STAFF WE SAID NO WE HAVE TO GET IT ALL DONE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE AND THAT IS A PLACE FOR THE BOARD REALLY ASSERTED ITSELF. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- EQUITY IF YOU WILL OPEN DOWN THE INSTITUTIONS- CHOOSING THE CHANCELLOR PERHAPS IS THE MOST. IMPORTANT JOB OF THE BOARD HAS OUR LOOK THE FREELANCE. I THINK THAT THE- THE- THERE BEEN SOME VERY DIFFICULT LESSEN SOME VERY PAINFUL LESSONS LEARNED. RECENTLY IN DURING OUR VERY SHORT TENURE WE WE'VE RUN THEM VERY QUICKLY. I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE THOSE LESSONS AND MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE GO INTO THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT CHANCELLOR. THAT WE REALLY DO THAT. WILL TAKE THOSE LESSONS TO HEART THAT WE DO A VERY THOROUGH VETTING. THAT WE DO THE KINDS OF REFERENCE CHECKS. NO MATTER HOW WELL WE KNOW PREFERRED CANDIDATES. WE NEED TO NOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. AND IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AND INSISTENT DEMANDS THE BOARD HAS FULL INFORMATION. BEFORE MAKES A FINAL DECISION SO THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED THERE THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION BECAUSE THAT LEADERSHIP IN A SENSE WILL SET THE TONE AND IN THE SENSE OF. LEAD THE WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS A TIME- IN THE CSU SYSTEM. WHERE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DEFINITELY HAS TO DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE- AND NEEDS TO LISTEN FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED- ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNED IS IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE A GOOD DECISION MAKER A GOOD POLICY MAKER FOR OUR SYSTEM I HAVE TO HEAR FROM THEM- I'VE- BEEN ABLE TO VISIT LIKE I SAID FIVE CAMPUSES AS FAR AND- WIDE TO DO EVEN MORE- BUT MEETING. WITH STUDENTS DIRECTLY MEETING WITH STAFF AND FACULTY DIRECTLY MEETING WITH OUR ADMINISTRATORS. REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES ALSO- AND- AND HOW THEY SERVE THEIR STUDENTS.

PLEASED WITH OUR INTERIM CHANCELLOR WHO JUST STARTED THIS WEEK WHO HAS HIT THE GROUND RUNNING- YOU KNOW TO ENSURE THAT. TRUST IS RESTORED IN THE SYSTEM- I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE THIS IS A TIME OF RESTORATION. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN THESE IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS HEALING. AND DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DO THAT- WITH THAT SAID- THERE IS- I AM GLAD TO FOR AN APPOINTMENT TO BE THE VICE CHAIR.

THANK YOU I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU ANSWERING THAT QUESTION IN SUCH DETAIL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GOING FORWARD ON ALL THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A LOT TO DO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BELIEVE WHEN WE STARTED- BEFORE THE FIRST APPOINTMENT SENATOR LAYERED MADE A COMMENT ABOUT. THE MEETINGS IN THE IN THE BEST THAT HE'S HAD- WITH BOTH OF YOU AS WELL AS THE UC REGENT- I APPOINTEE AND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY- YOU ARE- BOTH IN TERMS OF YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR- PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE HERE. EVERYONE HAS A STORY ABOUT HOW THEY GET TO COLLEGE AND IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S MEANING FULL OF FOR THOSE OF US WHO FEEL FORTUNATE WE GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE OR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH WASN'T NECESSARILY EXPECTED. I IN I AM IN THE STORIES ARE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE REFLECTIVE- WHEN YOU MAKE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR YOUNG FOLKS WHO WHO JUST WANT A CHANCE SO- IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN REALLY ODD DELIGHTFUL FRANKLY TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW TO APPROACH SOME PRETTY. DIFFICULT ISSUES AS I SAID EARLIER I WASN'T UC REGENT I WAS ALSO A CSU TRUSTEE AND I COULD SEE THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS AND I COULD SEE THE PASSION OF THOSE THAT SERVED ON THE BOARD YOU CLEARLY HAD SOME DIFFICULT ISSUES. AND YOUR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WHETHER IT'S THE YOU KNOW THE SEARCH FOR A CHANCELLOR TO ARM HOW TO APPROACH TESTING AND CREDENTIALS THINGS- IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY GOOD TO BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFUL PROCESS- SO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS. BUT I SEE THAT A SENATOR COM LONGER IS HERE AND I WANT TO GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DOES COME ON I. REMEMBER TEM AND I'M I WAS- REFLECTING ON MY TIME. AT A- BOARD TRUSTEE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT- AND HEARING FROM SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DURING MY TIME THERE. WHO ARE WORKING DESPERATELY TO MATRICULATED INTO EITHER THE CSU OR THE UC SYSTEM- AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS- TROIKA IS OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT TRIFACTA OF- COLLEGE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE THAT OUR PUBLIC THAT ARE REALLY SO CRITICAL FOR HOW YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MOVE UP. I REALLY JUST HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SB I WAS INSPIRED BY THE STORIES- THAT I WAS HEARING FROM THE TWO OF YOU I'M AN WAS THINKING ABOUT NOT ONLY IS IT ABOUT WANTING STUDENTS TO ATTEND AND GRADUATE. AND HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO MOVE THROUGH- BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE A WORKFORCE THAT IS DIVERSE- AND RESPONSIVE BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE ALCHEMY OTHER STUDENT SUCCESS. PAN ANY OF THAT. THE WOW MORE THAN THREE OUT OF FOUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR JUST BARELY ONE IN THREE OF THEIR TEACHERS ARE- AND THAT CAME FROM AN EDUCATION. TRUST WEST- REPORT AND SO I YOU KNOW. I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT- IN LA AND SORT OF SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE USE TO DIVERSIFY OUR WORKFORCE. AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW- FROM. L. IT BOTH OF YOU I GUESS AND THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO BE IT- HOW IS THE CSU WORKING TO BUILD A LARGER AND MORE DIVERSE WORK FORCE- SENATE- TRUSTEE LOPEZ WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT FIRST AND THEN TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IT'S SOMETHING IT'S ONE OF THESE MEDIUM TERM LONG TERM PRIORITIES THAT WE REALLY NEED TO START. FOCUSING ON AND SHINING A SPOTLIGHT TODAY. THERE IS A DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS OR FACTS IN TERMS OF THE FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY AS A WHOLE. BUT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REALLY GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION. AND WE HAVE THE HIGHER THE WORK FORCE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THAT REALLY REFLECTS WHO WERE EDUCATING HIM THE POPULATION OR LISTEN TO CAN SEE THEMSELVES. AND THEY ARE IN THE WORK FORCE AND THEIR PROFESSORS THAT'S FIXED TERM IMPORTANT. THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THE RECRUITMENT AND WHAT OF THE PIPELINES AND HOW MANY. YOU KNOW WHAT OF THE PIPELINES TO GET A PHD IN BECOME A PROFESSOR AT A COLLEGE. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I THINK THAT SHE THIS YEAR ACTUALLY. IS HAS IS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THIS WORKING VERY HARD. ON SEVERAL LEVELS IN TERMS OF RECRUITING NATIONALLY USING ALL THE NETWORKS THEY CAN MAKING SURE THAT THEY USE BEST PRACTICES. BEING AWARE OF UNCONSCIOUS BIASES WITH FEDERAL TO RECRUIT AND REALLY BRING IN A DIVERSE POOL OF EXISTING CANNABIS. BUT ALSO DEVELOPING PIPELINES WE DON'T HAVE THE PHD PROGRAMS THOSE IN THE UC AND OTHER. UP HERE WATER WAS A DARK AND I ALWAYS GET THIS WRONG. THE RESEARCH ONE INSTITUTIONS. YOU KNOW BUT CONNECTING THEM. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS OF. THE TARGET TO SOME OF PRESENT AND SOME INSTANCES I THINK THE SEALS OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT OUR GRADUATE STUDENTS INTO PHD PROGRAMS TO BECOME THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW AND I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING ALREADY. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT- AND HE SAID THAT THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY- JUST MAKE THE SHORT IS. IT TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE BOARD IT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE CHANCELLOR AND IT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE FOR THE PRESENTS OTHER WORDS IT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE LEADERSHIP. AND WE NEED TO HOLD WE NEED TO REVIEW THE PROGRESS AND WE NEED TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO SEEING WHAT PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING. SO. THANK YOU GO AHEAD- TRUSTEE RODRIGUEZ. AND JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT TOO- WHAT TRUSTEE LOPEZ SAID- YOU KNOW I THINK- ONE OF THE UNIQUE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I ASKED THIS QUESTION WHEN I'VE GONE TO THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND- YOU KNOW THE UNIQUE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE CAMPUSES IS YOU KNOW WHEN. HOW THEY ARE ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY- ON HIRING COMMITTEES AND ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE FACULTY THAT REPRESENT THEIR STUDENTS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE READY THAT YOU ARE READY FOR YOU KNOW MAKING A YOU KNOW HAVING SPACE- UP FOR OUR DIVERSE FACULTY YOU KNOW ART IS THERE COMMUNITY RT SAT ON THOSE CAMPUSES ARE.

I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY HUSBAND JOHN BAKER AND MY FATHER JIM RAMSEY WERE VIRTUALLY ATTENDING TODAY'S HEARING. I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH AS WELL AS MY CHILDREN IAN AND CHARLOTTE MY BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY AND MY WHOLE EXTENDED FAMILY FOR THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER MY MOTHER KATHY. WHO PASSED AWAY SEVERAL YEARS AGO BUT WHO I KNOW WOULD BE PROUD. I WOULD ALSO LIKE. SOME ADDITIONAL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE WHO HELPED SHAPE ME INTO WHO I AM AND WHO HAVE SUPPORTED MY GROWTH AS A LEADER. MY FRIENDS MY MENTORS AND COLLEAGUES. FINALLY I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE CDSS TEAM. WERE PROVIDED ME WITH ONGOING ASSISTANCE. EXPERTISE AND GRACE AND WE WORK HARD EVERY DAY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS. I'VE WORKED TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING AT AMAZING MISSION DRIVEN LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS. THIS ALLOWED ME TO MAKE A COUPLE CHANGES THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CHILDREN. OTHER TAKE ON THIS NEW ROLE I'M USING ALL THAT EXPERIENCE TO ASSIST DIRECTOR JOHNSON IN MEETING THE DEPARTMENT SCHOOLS USING A PERSON CENTRED EQUITY BASED APPROACH TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND SERVICES THEY NEED. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE WHOLE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FAMILY HELP CREATE EQUITY ECONOMICS IN THE AND HEALTH AND WELL BEING FOR LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK WE WILL IF YOU'RE READY SENATOR GROVE WHICH TO START. THANK YOU MA'AM OKAY. UPON THIS YES. THANK YOU MISS RAMSEY FOR BEING HERE TODAY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF STATE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WITH THE COST INCREASES AND FOR EVER- THE INFLATION GOING HIGHER AND EVERYTHING AND NOT TO MAKE THIS POLITICAL IN ANY WAY BUT- A LOT OF OUR SENIORS ARE STRUGGLING. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET SENT IN TO MEET AND MAKE IT THROUGH THE MONTH. S. THE ISSUES THAT KOBE HAD ON WITH ISOLATION DEPRESSION AND ALL THOSE THINGS BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR SENIORS WERE VERY MUCH ISOLATED. SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE IMPACT FOR DSS PROGRAMS- WHAT'S THE INFORMATION. IMPLEMENTATION TIME FOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE IMPACT FOR DSS PROGRAMS. AND THEN WHAT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT DOES. AS DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES HAVE IN THE CREATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IN PA PRIORITIES. AND I JUST ASK THAT BECAUSE I JUST AM LOOKING FOR A TIMELINE AND WHEN HELP IS GOING TO ARRIVE. YEAH I THINK YOU CENTER GROVE I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND I WAS. VERY INVOLVED IN THE- STAKEHOLDER CREATION OF THE MASTER PLAN REPORT ON LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND MY PREVIOUS JOB AT JUSTICE IN AGING- I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN. ISSUES AROUND HELPING LOW INCOME OLDER CALIFORNIANS MAKE SURE THEY HAVE- THE SERVICES AND BENEFITS THEY NEED TO LIVE SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES- SO I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT GOAL- AS YOU HEARD FROM MY TITLE AND- FOCUSED. ON DISABILITY ADULTS IN HOUSING INTEGRATION AND I THINK EACH OF THE DIVISIONS I OVERSEE. REALLY HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN IMPROVING THE LIVES OF OLDER ADULTS CALIFORNIA. I'M ALL FOR SOME EXAMPLES- WE ADMINISTER THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING GOALS THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. CAN LIVE SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES. OF THAT INCLUDES- TRAINING AND MORE- EXCUSE ME MORE- ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL SUPPORTED THAT THEIR WORK FORCES AVAILABLE FOR THEM. AND THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT. IN B. I. H. ASK PATH FOR. WOULD IS A TWO HUNDRED AND NINE FIVE GOT MILLION DOLLAR IN. THAT WAS APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WE'RE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS ON. RETAINING RECRUITING AND PROVIDING CLEAR LATTICES FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROVIDERS AND WE REALLY FIND THAT. THAT ILL BE A PATHWAY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AGES US PROGRAM IS STRONG THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS THAT ARE. RECIPIENTS IN THE PROGRAM FEEL WELL SUPPORTED BY THEIR PROVIDERS AND THE PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN- THE ABILITY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SKILLS AND RECEIVE THE TRAINING WE NEED. SO THAT WILL HELP WITH TWO DIFFERENT OF THE MASTER PLAN SCHOOLS THE ONE ON IMPROVING- FOR ALL AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT CAN SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES. I'M ADDITIONALLY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS BRANCH AT A FEW DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO HELP SENIORS WERE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR HOUSING. THAT INCLUDES OUR NEW COMMUNITY EXPANSION PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF LICENSE FACILITIES THAT SERVE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO PRESERVE EXISTING FACILITIES AND EITHER REALLY FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ON SSI OR S. P. OR RECEIVING CAPPY WHO ARE SOME OF OUR LOWEST INCOME SENIORS IN THE STATE. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO WORKING THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATOR LICENSING DIVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FACILITIES STATE WIDE THAT WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO NEED AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF CARE AND SUPPORT ARE RECEIVING THAT. SO I HAVE. OF WAYS IN WHICH THIS CDSS CAN IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH IN CONVERSATIONS BOTH WITH OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AROUND WHAT DO WE DO NEXT WHAT ARE THE OUR PLANS MOVING FORWARD. AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WHO'S LEADING THE MASTER PLAN EFFORTS SERVICES. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED AND THOUGHTFUL I NEVER REALLY LIFTING UP. ON THE NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND REALLY TAKING AN EQUITY BASED APPROACH TO DOING THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT EVERYONE. HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY AGE WE WANT TO BE PARTICULARLY MINDFUL OF THAT AS WE PREPARE AND MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT MY NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT COLLABORATION WHICH YOU WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND TO MAKE THAT. HAPPEN AND SO I YOU ANSWERED THAT ON YOUR QUESTION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONFIRMATION MA'AM. THANK YOU SOMUCH SENATORS THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE OF SENATOR LAYERED THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND INTERESTINGLY CENTER GROVE WHAT RIGHT FOR THE SUBJECT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT FOR BECAUSE THE- YOU INDICATED IN. IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT YOU HAD FOUR MAJOR GOALS AND PRIORITIES IN THE FIRST ON A CENTERING THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS SO LET ME BUILD ON WHAT SENATOR GROVE JUST DID. IT AND IT'S A MORE OF. TWO QUESTIONS ONE WE CONFIRMED THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF AGING WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW. THE MASTER PLAN WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO ACTION HOW IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TAKEN BECAUSE THE FIRST THING WE DID LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET IS TO CREATE POSITIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS STILL OUT THERE AND I THINK SENATOR GROVE WAS ASKING CLEARLY ABOUT IT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY ACTIONS THAT ARE IN FACT IMPLEMENTED OUT OF THE MASTER PLAN FROM YOUR LEVEL HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND- AS I MENTIONED- I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTEND ANY OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS BUT- ACTION WAS REALLY THE WORD OF THE DAY RIGHT NOBODY WANTED TO REPORT. OR A MASTER PLAN THAT SAT ON THE SHELF. THERE WAS A REAL ENERGY. AND A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING BE A CONCRETE- JUBAL PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA AND I AM VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT I STAKEHOLDERS. A LOT OF REPORTS AND THEN THE PLAN THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT IN PLACE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS TRULY AN ACTUAL PLAN AND I THINK THAT REALLY STARTS WITH OUR FIVE FOLD GOALS. AND REALLY HONING IN ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THOSE REALITY SO AGAIN I'LL USE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS UNDER CSS AS AN EXAMPLE. I MENTIONED- I AGES AS A SHIP WHICH IS GETTING OFF THE GROUND. BUT THERE ARE MANY INITIATIVES WHICH ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ALREADY HELPING CALIFORNIANS- IN MANY WAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW BUT WHAT WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AND I THINK IN LARGE PART BECAUSE- OF THE PRESSURE. PRESSURE FROM THE MASTER PLAN AND THE REAL COMMITMENT TO IT BY BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT PROGRAM RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO HELP US SERVE MORE INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE SO LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE. IS FINE HERMIT HOUSING. BUT NOW WITH THE EXPANDED FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED AND THE ADDITIONAL YEARS TO WORK ON THAT. WE ARE BOTH GOING TO BE ABLE TO THINK HELP CLOSER TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HELP SAYS DISABILITY BENEFITS. AND FIND HOUSING. BUT WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE NOW AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS BUT HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FALLEN INTO HOMELESSNESS AND WE THINK THAT PREVENTION STRATEGY. IS GOING TO HELP US STEM THE TIDE OF I HEARD THIS FROM A DOCTOR WHO SHALL WHO'S A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT. TOLD ISSUES IN HOUSING ISSUES. AND WHEN I THINK SHE MADE REALLY CLEAR WAS. WE BOTH HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MOST CRISIS RIGHT NOW LIVING ON THE STREETS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR HOME. I THINK WHAT THE DEPARTMENT AND LARGE AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION MORE GENERALLY IS TRYING TO DO IS TO TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH BOTH HELP THE MOST NEEDY RIGHT NOW. BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT THE PROACTIVE STRATEGIES WE CAN TAKE TO CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR. SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S THE- AGE PROGRAM WHICH IS. ALSO HOUSE. UNCONNECTED IN. A PROTECT SERVICES THAT ALREADY BY BUT ALSO WAS. SIGNIFICAN ADDITIONAL FUNDS. BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE NOW EXPANDED INTO. A ONE INCH OF FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND TO TRIBAL ENTITIES AND THE OTHER ONE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO WITHOUT. ALMOST COMPLETELY COVERING THE WHOLE STATE WITH THOSE PROGRAMS. AND THEN AS WE ROLL OUT OUR COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. GOING TO AS I MENTIONED BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WHICH IS NEW FOR US AND I THINK AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL TANGIBLE RESULTS. AT THE END OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL HAVE PHYSICALLY MORE LICENSE FACILITIES FOR OLDER ADULTS TO LIVE SAFELY AND SO I THINK. HOW I SEE THE MASTER PLAN IS A LIVING DOCUMENT AS A FRAMEWORK WE'RE GOING TO FIND NEW SOLUTIONS NEW IDEAS NEW PROBLEMS WILL EMERGE AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THE PRINCIPLES AND THE GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN TO DRIVE US. TOWARD CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. WELL MY PRECIADO SAID I THINK. THE CHALLENGES A NEW RACE TO QUESTION AND SORT OF YOUR ANSWER THE CHALLENGES. IS MAKING SURE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST HAVING GOALS AND- ACHIEVING NUMBERS IT'S WORKING ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY IMPACTING CHANGE IN IT IT'S LIKE I KNOW BEING ANSWER. HAVING BEEN IN CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS MY QUESTION IS ALWAYS. ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE END AND HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO REALLY FEEL THE HIM. FROM WHAT IT IS WORTH IT AND I THINK. THAT HAS TO BE THE UNDERLYING QUESTION AND- AND WHEN YOU WENT INTO HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S AN ISSUE. THAT'S WHERE YOU RAISED THE NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT ARE HIDDEN MY DISTRICT. IT IS JUST OFF THE CHARTS AND WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE AND WHAT IS HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY WERE IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO THAT'S- THAT'S TRUE TOO AND I KNOW MAYBE YOU HALF. OUR OUR ONE SUBSET OF D. DEALING WITH AGING AND- WITH THAT PART. THE REAL CHALLENGE IS MAKE IT TO THAT OP DE. IS MAKING SURE WHAT COMES FROM SACRAMENTO SUPPORTS WHAT'S WORKING ON THE GROUND AND SOMETIMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE SACRAMENTAL. THERE IS A DISCONNECT AND I THINK PEOPLE WOULD. IN THIS AND OTHER COMMITTEES ARE PROBABLY GETTING TIRED OF ME TALKING ABOUT. THAT THE PARK HOMELESS IN MY HOME TOWN IS BIGGER ON A PER CAPITA BASIS SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO AND OAKLAND. BUT THE MONEY COMES ON A PER CAPITA BASIS SO IT NEVER ALLOWS THEM TO GET AHEAD. MARCUSE A PER CAPITA BASIS ON THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT NUMBER ALLOWS THEM TO GET AHEAD. OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS TO HAVE SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THERE'S CERTAIN PLACES WHERE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DONE. THAT REALLY WORK AND THAT PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP AND DOING THINGS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND WAS SERVICES AND YET AT THE SAME TIME. THE MONEY COMES IN CERTAIN PARTS IT DOESN'T COME. FROM HERE AUTOMATICALLY OR AND ARE EASILY READILY EASIER WE WAY. TO GET TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THAT ON THE GROUND THAT SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. IN A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS THE FACT THAT YOU SORT OF RECOGNIZE. TO THE OUT. SURE EVERYTHING IS GUIDE TO THE OUTCOMES I THINK THAT'S REALLY TRUE WITH HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AND AFTER MY WILL RIFF OR RENT- GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO MAYBE TALK ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE MOVE THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU- YOU YOU PROVIDE ME A LITTLE MORE CHANCE TO ANSWER BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR IS HOW COMMITTED THE DEPARTMENT IS AND HOW COMMITTED I AM. TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND HAVING THE TYPE OF CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH OUR COUNTIES WITH OUR- RECIPIENTS WHO ARE HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE EITHER WITH HOMELESSNESS OR RECEIVING AS A SIRE I JUST US WHO ARE THE PROVIDERS OF THESE SERVICES YOU KNOW REALLY TALKING TO THE SPECTRUM OF GOAL- AND MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE SO THAT MEANS LISTEN TO THEM IN THE LANGUAGES THEY SPEAK COMING INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND REALLY HEARING THE FEEDBACK AND BEING BOTH WILLING TO BE. I THINK BOTH REALLY BROAD MINDED AND WHAT HEARING WHAT ARE WE DOING THAT WORKS WHAT ARE WE DOING THAT- NEED TO PROVE MEANT AND REALLY TAKING THAT. FEEDBACK AND THEN GOING BACK. IN THIS CONVERSATION AND WE THINKING HOW WE IMPROVE. OUR PROGRAMS. I'M HERE PLEASE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO THOUGHTFULLY- AROUND HOMELESSNESS IS. THE THOUGHTFUL IN OUR ALLOCATIONS. AND TRYING TO MAKE THE MONEY FLOW AS- SEAMLESSLY AND SIMPLY AS WE CAN WALL. PROTECTING GOVERNMENT FUNDS AND MAKING SURE. THAT THE MONEY IS GOING WHO NEEDS IT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY ON RELEASING A NOTICE OF FUNDING ALLOCATION. AS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. WILL HELP PRESERVE OUR FACILITIES AND HELP ALLOW FOR OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR LICENSED FACILITIES. THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO THROUGH COUNTIES. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IS WHEN WE ALLOCATE THAT MONEY REALLY NOT JUST SIMPLY WHO'S THE BIGGEST COUNTY YOU GET THE MOST MONEY BUT LOOKING AT. WHAT IS YOUR S. ASIDE POPULATION WITHIN THE COUNTY WHAT IS YOUR HOMELESSNESS COUNT WITHIN THE COUNTY AND HOW MANY LICENSED FACILITIES DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE IN THAT COUNTY. SO IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE A THOUGHTFUL LOOK AT THE FACTORS YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. AND NOT SIMPLY JUST BEING NARROW MINDED ABOUT OUR FOCUS STAY ON UP FOR STATISTICS BUT REALLY. KNOWING THAT THE WORK WE DO IMPACTS PEOPLE'S LIVES AND WE REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO PEOPLE IF WE'RE NOT GETTING THE MONEY OUT APPROPRIATELY. AND IF WE'RE NOT A LEARNING FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING- WE ARE VERY MUCH IF YOU'VE GOT A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP RIGHT NOW AROUND OUR PROGRAMS WE REACH OUT OFTEN STAKEHOLDERS WE LET. THEM REVIEW OUR GUIDANCE BEFORE IT'S- AT LEAST WE TAKE COMMENTS RESPOND FEEDBACK. ALWAYS HAPPY MEET WITH AND HEAR HOW THINGS ARE WORKING. AND WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO HEAR WHERE MAYBE OUR PROGRAMS- ARE THERE ARE GAPS IN WHERE THERE ARE. MORE AND MORE THINGS ARE NEEDED AND ONE THING I JUST DID WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE WORK I'VE DONE IS AROUND OLDER ADULTS BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. COVER A BRIGHTER. COLORS TRUMP. AND ALSO SERVED- FAMILIES ON CAL WORKS- FAMILIES INVOLVED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF AGES- YOU KNOW. TWENTY TWO. TWO HUNDRED YEAH A PLUS SO. WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO THINK ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE SERVING WORKING FOR PEOPLE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER AND I ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING. WITH YOU ON THIS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND DESIST THIS CONVERSATION IS JUST THE START THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE A DETAILED RESPONSE. THANK YOU EARLIER. MUCH. OF MANIFIESTO. COOL THANK YOU- DIRECTOR RAMSEY FOR THAT VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. OF MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY SENATOR LARRY YOU COVER THE ISSUES THAT ARE ON HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A- MAJOR CONCERN ON THE LAST THE INTERVIEW WE HAD. WE CLEAR THAT-THE CONTINUE OF CARE ISSUE WAS A SIGNIFICAN IN MY FAMILY I AND MY BROTHER WAS VERY ILL AND TRYING TO FIND A PLACE IN HIS. OF HIS FUNDS RAN OUT TO WAS GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGE ON MY PART OF. THE COUNTRY AND I IN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR SO THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT IS UP AND RUNNING AND THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT BEING FOCUSED ON THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL- I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TEMPORARY PROJECT GREEN KEY FUNDING. ISSUE AND WOOD EXPIRES DO WE HAVE A PLAN FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING CARE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THE HOUSING FIRST- YOU KNOW THE ISSUE WHERE NO TREATMENT YES- KINDA. PUT SOMEONE AT HOME BUT DON'T GET PLAN TO THOSE WHO ARE. SUFFERING FROM. AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST ON. MANNER AND TAKING CARE AND HOPING THAT WE GET TAKING CARE OF THEM AND HOPING THAT WE GET THEM BACK HI INTO SOBRIETY ANDY AND TO- YOU KNOW A POSITIVE PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT SPECIFICALLY NOT SURE THAT THAT- YEAR REACHES THERE WITH THE HOME KEEP. PROJECT THE ROOM KEY PROJECT EXCUSE ME SO IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE MAYBE A LITTLE IN WHITE MEN ON ON IF THERE'S ANY LOOK SEE AT THAT AND WHAT WE ARE DOING- AND ALL WE'VE HEARD LIMIT LET ME SAY THIS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR COUNTY IS THAT. THERE IS A MINOR PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT AND I SAY MINOR I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT REALLY ENTAILS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE- LEAVING ROOM KEY AND THEN BACK ON THE STREET I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE COUNT YET. HOUSE SIGNIFICANT IDEAS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL CERTAINLY COME INTO YOUR YOUR ARENA AT SOME POINT IN TIME IF NOT ALREADY AND IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHT FOUND OUT ABOUT WHAT WITH THE TRANSITION AND HOW ARE WE HELPING OUR COUNTIES WITHOUT ISSUE. YEAH THANK YOU. UP PROJECT ROOM. UNDER MY PURVIEW. OF AND THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK FIRST. OF ALL WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDING WE ARE DOING I THOUGHT THE WIND DOWN OF PROJECT ROOM SHE- OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS HAS BEEN A HISTORIC FIRST IN THE NATION- PROGRAM. HAS SERVED MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP. ONE OF THE THINGS THE PROJECT ROOM HE WAS REALLY SET UP. TO DO- WHAT. TIMES TEMPORARY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE HIGH RISK OF KOBE OR WERE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING- COULD INFECTIONS AND NEEDED TO HAVE A PLACE TO ISOLATE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE LIVING ON THE STREET. SO OUR INTENTIONS FROM THE START OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TO PROVIDE PEOPLE A SAFE PLACE- AND TO GET AS MANY SERVICES INVOLVED WITH PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- WERE ABLE TO IF POSSIBLE EXITED TO. PERMANENT HOUSING OR TO ANOTHER STATE PLACE. NOT EVERYONE. HAS PROGRESSED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING- AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE AT VERY SHORT TERM TEMPORARY STAYS BIG. BUTTON TIONS. WORKING CLOSELY WITH H. CITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONNECTING OR PROJECT ROOM HE WITH THEIR PROJECT HOME HE- TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE A PATHWAY. WE ARE TRYING TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT HOW THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND HELP OUR LICENSE. RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES PROCREATE PLACEMENTS FOR SOME- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXITING HOMELESSNESS. WE DO HAVE A GROWING NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND- THEY MIGHT NEED A NEW AND LOCAL. AND WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO REALLY LOOK AT OUR OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR- OWN PURVIEW AT SOCIAL SERVICES BUT ALSO WITH IN- WHAT OTHER AGENCIES ARE OFFERING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY HAVING A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. THAT'S BEING VERY MUCH FACILITATED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS WHICH- THE DEPARTMENT IS A MEMBER AND REALLY WE THINK IS GIVING US A LOTOF OPPORTUNITIES. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE'RE REALLY FINDING THAT- YOU KNOW HOUSING PEOPLE FIRST WHAT IT GIVES THEM IT'S- THE SAFETY AND ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THE OTHER PIECES THAT THEY MAY NEED HELP WITH. SO FOR SOMEONE WHO'S MAYBE STRUGGLING WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT'S LIKE A DIET DIABETES I AM CONTROLLED IT'S VERY HARD TO GET TROLL ON THE STREET. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE HOUSING S. WELL HAVE SOME STABILITY IN A LIFE THEIR MUCH MORE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION. AS WE TRANSPORTED SUBSTANCE USE MORE AS A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT NEEDS THAT SORT OF STABILITY AND CONSTANT CARE WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO SIMILARLY SEE THOSE KIND OF RESULTS WERE REALLY GIVING PEOPLE. A TRUE OPPORTUNITY. TO FIND. FIND AND BEING- WITH OUR HOUSING POLICIES GONE I'D LIKE TO BE ON YEARS OF CALLED BACKLESS FOR YEARS CATCH ME UP LEFT A BECAUSE IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE ARE THAT I WANT TO FOLLOW SO I'LL BE CONNECTING BACK WITH YOU YOU CAN KEEP ME UPDATED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOMELESS COUNCIL FINALLY COME IN AND WE TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT OF WHAT'S WORKING I GUESS WE'D SAY WHAT BEST PRACTICES ARE IN I WILL CONTINUE TO I GUESS FROM GO BACK TO THE DISCUSSION OF HOUSING FIRST BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE NEED HOUSING FIRST CLASS WHERE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT. AS PUTTING IN A FARM HOUSE AND NOT PROVIDING OUR INSTANT REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THAT I TELL YOU THAT JUST BECAUSE I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER ONCE UPON A TIME TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADULT DAY THAN DOING THAT VERY THING. AND IT'S VERY IT'S A LOT EASIER WHEN SOMEONE HEALTH UP THEIR FINGERTIPS AND THESE WOULD BE VOLUNTARY OUR HOUSING FIRST PLUS INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY DO HAVE PRESCRIBED OF REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TREATMENTS SO I THINK AT SOME POINT TIME WE MIGHT ALL GET THERE BUT I KNOW RIGHT NOW IT'S THE IT'S AN EARLY CONCEPT. FOR ONLY ABOUT PRE WILL IMPRESS AND ALL OF THAT I THINK WE COULD WORK THROUGH THE BUT I'D I'D YOU TO KEEP ME UP TO DATE AND ARE YOU CERTAINLY WILL HAVE MY STRONG SUPPORT GOT A BIG JOB BUT YOU SEEM VERY WELL QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE. THIS ALONG THAT PATH TO SUCCESS. OF FINALLY ELIMINATING ALL THESE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS WE HAVE. IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION THANK YOU AND YOU'LL HAVE MY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES AND I WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AROUND THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES ARE SENATOR COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM UM AN DIE- IT'S BEEN GREAT LISTENING TO YOUR RESPONSES I AGREE WITH SENATOR LAYERED THEY ARE INCREDIBLY COMPREHENSIVE AND THOUGHTFUL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE I ASSUME THAT YOU CARRY THAT WITH YOU- IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING- ON A DAILY BASIS THAT KIND OF- THOUGHTFULNESS HI I HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS AND I HSS PROGRAM. DON'T YOU LOVE ALL THE ACRONYMS WE KNOW THAT- THERE'S BEEN A DROP IN THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS THAT ARE IN FACILITIES- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- I GUESS 43% OF FACILITIES ARE EXCEPT READ. WITH SERIOUS ILLNESSES- OR WHO HAVE SS I SS P. OR BOTH AND- WE ALSO KNOW THAT SIXTEEN OF THOSE FACILITIES CLOSED PERMANENTLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE LOAN SO THAT'S A LOSS OF A NUMBER OF- BEDS. NOT UNDER YOUR PURVIEW I KNOW BUT- THERE'S ALSO SOME CHALLENGES WE HAVE UP WITH OUR NURSING HOME FACILITIES- AND MAJOR DEFICIENCIES- THAT ARE IN SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW HUGE FEDERAL FINES- LEVIED ON SOME OF THEM AND REALLY FEAR AMONG THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING IN THEM. ULTIMATELY MY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE SUPPORT SENIORS WHO ARE LOOKING TO YOUR DEPARTMENT- FOR SAFE CHOICES- AS IT RELATES TO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED BY THE STATE AND SO JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU- IN YOUR ASSESSMENT WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE THREE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. THAT THE I STOP APPROACH. THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE LIVING ON THE MARGINS AND MAY FEEL LIKE THEY EITHER DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE MANY GOOD CHOICES WERE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ACCESS- INFORMATION ON THE GOOD CHOICES THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE THEM. THANK YOU SENATOR CALL LONGER LET ME JUST MAKE SURE THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR TWO PARTS YOUR QUESTION I'LL I'LL TALK TO FIRST TO THE SSI RECIPIENTS IN THE FACILITIES. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SOME CLOSURES- AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE THREE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING AN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES MY UNDERSTANDING YOUR CHANCES. YEAH GREAT. THANK YOU- SO. AS BE RECIPIENTS FOR TAKING THIS HE'S- VERY SERIOUSLY AND DOING A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW WE CAN SUPPORT OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS IT AND THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR DOING THAT SO WITHIN OUR- COMMUNICATOR LICENSING DIVISION. WHO LICENSES THOSE FACILITIES I THINK PART OF IT HERE- TO WHAT YOU JUST REPRESENTED WAS WHAT REALLY STARTING WITH DATA RIGHT WHAT DO WE- KNOW. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE FACILITIES HOW ARE THEY FARING AND WHAT ARE THE- CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING AND WE KNOW THAT- SSI STAYING COULD YOU KNOW THE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THIS WHEN THE DIRECTOR REGION WAS TALKING. YOU KNOW THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SENIORS- AND THEIR NEEDS JUST IS CHANGING. SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WERE WORKING VERY DELIBERATELY IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. THE DATA TELLS US ABOUT THE FACILITIES. AND WHERE THEY NEED SUPPORT. AND THEN WE MAKING SURE THE OUR LIFE. IS PROVIDING THAT YOU KNOW SHE A- MAKING SURE WE WEAPON ARE MAKING WE'RE DOING THE OUTRAGE. AND- MAKING FACILITIES ARE SAFE RIGHTS REALLY ABOUT HER. COMPLIANCE FORCED STRATEGY THAT WE OUT FOR PROMISED. ON BUT WE KNOW THAT. LICENSING ALONE CANNOT SOURCE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT. BUILT. TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL ENDEAVOR. THAT COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION IS DOING TWO MAJOR THINGS IT'S REALLY GOING TO FUND EXPANSION OF FACILITIES WE'RE HOPING RIGHT NOW ARE EARLY ESTIMATES WERE HOPING TO HAVE AS MANY AS FOUR THOUSAND NEW GUIDES THAT ARE SERVING AS A SITE RECIPIENTS AND PART OF GETTING THAT MONEY. IS MAKING. A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO ALL THOSE BAGS TO SSI RECIPIENTS SO THAT WERE REALLY- CREATING A MORE GUARANTEED CAPACITY WITHIN OUR CITY- BUT SOME OF THAT MONEY IS ALSO GOING TO PRESERVING EXISTING. AND YOU MAY BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN INVESTING IN OPERATING SUBSIDIES. TO HELP OUR CURRENT FACILITIES MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN MEET THEIR OPERATING COSTS WHETHER THAT STAMPING UTILITIES ON SORT OF ALL THE OTHER NON SERVICE RELATED. EXPENSES THAT GO ALONG WITH RUNNING THE FACILITY. BUT THEY'RE REALLY SUPPORTED AND THEN WE ALSO ADDITIONAL MONEY TO PER SERVICE SO IT IS THAT MAYBE HAVING LIKE PHYSICAL PLANT. IN FLIGHT. WE CAN THE- OF. YOU KNOW I NEED FOR A NEW- FURNACE OR AIR CONDITIONER WE'RE DOING- THAT KIND OF REHABILITATION WORK AS WELL AND WE'RE HOPING. THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF THESE EXISTING FACILITIES IN TERMS OF THEIR- FINANCES SO THAT THEY CAN REALLY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES TO OUR- RECIPIENTS- ON. THAT PROGRAM IS REALLY YOU KNOW IS MOVING ALONG WE ARE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS NOW WE'RE HOPING TO START MAKING OUR FIRST AWARDS THIS SUMMER. AND WE'RE HOPING WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS TO BE RELEASING OUR NOTICE OF FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. FOR THOSE PRESERVATION PLANS SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GO FULL STEAM AHEAD- AND REALLY TAKE THIS CAPACITY ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY- CAN OVER. THE I JUST AS POPULATION- YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART ALL THE WORK I DO IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BUT I'VE WORKED ON I JUST LAST FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW IT'S JUST. HONESTLY A GREAT PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS STOP AND REALIZE WHAT A UNIQUE PROGRAM IT IS NATIONWIDE- IT REALLY ALLOWS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ON MEDICARE ALL IN OUR LOW INCOME TO LIVE SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES AND HIGHER. THEIR OWN PROVIDERS. SO IT'S REALLY- IT'S REALLY ENABLING BOTH- YOU KNOW INDEPENDENCE FOR OUR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT OUR SUPPORT OF SERVICES ARE REALLY REACHING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND- SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT IT ON THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO THE PROGRAM I THINK. THE THREE BIGGEST I WOULD SAY IS NUMBER ONE RETAINING AND RECRUITING WORKFORCE. I'M YOU KNOW I THINK WORKFORCE IS PROBABLY COME UP IN EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERY TOPIC YOU KNOW WE JUST ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR WORKFORCE- EIGHT HUNDRED PATHWAYS PROGRAM THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER IS REALLY- WORKING TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR OUR I JUST AS PROVIDERS THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE PAYING THEM FOR THEIR TRAINING HOURS. IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE IN. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RETAINING PROVIDERS. AND THEN IT'S ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE COACHING SUPPORT TO PROVIDE CAREER LATTICES FOR PEOPLE. SO I THINK WORKFORCE TO ME IT'S JUST ABSOLUTE TOP OF THE LIST. ON NEXT I THINK OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. LISTENING AND RESPONDING TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE I JUST AS- I'M SPACE I THINK. THAT WHAT WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS THE NEED FOR AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM- WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THAT. WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING- FINALIZE THAT WE HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO REALLY FIND- THE PATH FORWARD ON A PERMANENT DACA SYSTEM SO THAT IF SOMEONE HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW A PROVIDER. WHO CAN'T COME AND THEY NEED THE SERVICES THAT THERE'S TO PROVIDE SERVICE. AND THEN I THINK THREE IT'S SOMETHING BE THOUGHT ABOUT. AROUND GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM- YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS PROGRAM IS HERE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND SO WE'RE JUST BEING REALLY. MAKE SURE WERE OPERATING THE PROGRAM- EFFICIENTLY. AND EFFECTIVELY AND REALLY WITH OUR CAL PARTNER. FOR DOING THE ON THE GO. IMPLEMENTATION JUST MAKE SURE. WERE SERVING- THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE SERVED AND MAKING SURE BEING- THOUGHTFUL- YOU KNOW STEWARDS OF A GOVERNMENT FUNDS. FOR I JUST TO CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE. TO SEE THE BEST. WERE OFTEN. GO IN AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING SUPPORT. THEY NEED. SAFETY FOR CHILDREN AND THAT OUR LICENSING ANALYSTS ARE ABLE TO GET YOU DISABILITIES. YEARLY NOW AND REALLY- HAVE EYES ON THE FACILITIES AND REALLY BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND FEEL THAT WERE. COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE- PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICES WE CAN FOR OUR CHILDREN YES SOME TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT SINCE YOU MENTIONED- TUCKER LAWCENTER MAY HAVE A SHOT. AND HE'S ALL. AND THE- GOAL OF FEMALE WARRIORS IN THE FIGHT FOR CHILD CARE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CALL LONGER AND I JUST OF CNC STROLL WAS. FIRST IS A LAWYER. HE SHE GOT ME GOING TO MY CREW. IS A SMALLER WORLD TONIGHT WE- AND WE ARE ONE OF THE WE ARE THE LARGEST STATE SO. HI IT'S GREAT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SO MANY INCREDIBLE RESOURCES HERE CALIFORNIANS- A LOT OF GROUND HAS BEEN COVERED ON SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WANTED TO. ASK ONE- DIFFERENT UPDATE- I KNOW THAT COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING IS THE LARGEST DIVISION ON UNDER YOU. AND I WANTED TO JUST ASK WHERE WE ARE IN A STATUS MYBE UPDATE OF. THE FACILITIES- THAT WERE DECERTIFIED THE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES FOR THE PLACEMENT OF FOSTER YOUTH. I KNOW THAT OF ALL WILL SPEND ALMOST A COUPLE YEARS NOW OR AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO. ALL HUNDRED THIRTY YOUTH WERE BROUGHT BACK THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES SO. I WANTED TO KIND OF GET A SENSE FROM YOU HOW- OUR THE FOSTER YOUTH WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS BEING CARED FOR WITHOUT THIS OPTION DO WE HAVE. AT THIS POINT SUFFICIENT CAPACITY CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A GENERAL UPDATE ON ON HOW THAT'S GOING. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S SORT OF TWO DIVISIONS OVERSEEING THIS WORK- OBVIOUSLY COMMUNICATOR LICENSING IS A BIG PIECE OF THIS BECAUSE WE LICENSE OUR CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. BUT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES WHICH IS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF MY COLLEAGUE DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRAIL. UP IS YOU KNOW OVERSEEING THE WELFARE SYSTEM SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE- AND I'LL JUST SPEAK UP MOSTLY FROM MY SIDE AS A LIGHT. PASSING I'M SORRY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER ABOUT THE CAPACITY ISSUE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK ON GETTING A LOT OF THOUGHT TO I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST. OF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO A TEMPORARY- YOU KNOW SORT OF A STEP DOWN FROM OR OUT OF STATE FACILITIES WE BROUGHT ALL THE U. FAQ THERE IS A CURRENT PROCESS IN PLACE WHERE IF THERE'S A CHILD SPECIFIC NEED FOR AN OUT OF STATE FACILITY. A COUNTY CAN APPLY FOR THAT. NOT HAD ANY COUNTY'S ACTIVATE THAT- THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CHOICE AND SO WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY CHILDREN PLACE OUT OF STATE. I'M NOT LEASES TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE IN STATE- CAPACITY AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR OUR USE- ON. THAT IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION I DO WANT TO BE HONEST BECAUSE WHAT THE CAPACITY NEEDS ARE ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFIC BY COUNTY. BUT ALSO SPECIFIC BY THE MIX OF CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME NOT COUNTY. SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THERE IS BOTH THE NEED TO HAVE BROADER SYSTEMIC CONVERSATIONS AND REALLY TO LOOK AT THE FACILITIES WE LICENSE RIGHT NOW DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT. BASILIDES LIES. ARE WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD GOALS TO HOME LIKE SETTINGS AND WE WILL FROM HOME SO. AND YOU HAVE SOARED INNOVATIVE OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN USE WHEN WE HAVE MORE COMPLEX CARE IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE EXPLORING. A WITH COUNTIES IS THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS WHICH ALREADY DISPOSED STR TEEPEES THAT ALREADY EXIST. CAN WE SOMETIMES USE THEM AS ONLY ACCOUNT OF ONE OR TWO THAT REALLY ARE WAITING AND READY FOR KIDS WHO ARE HAVING. SEX NEEDS TO A REALLY TRAUMA INFORMED AND READY READY TO WORK WITH OUR CHILDREN- SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION HAVING US. LEVEL WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES WHEN THEY EITHER WE'VE SEEN THAT THEY- NEEDED US TO REACH OUT TO THEM OR WITH MADE AFFIRMATIVELY REACHED OUT TO US. TO REALLY SEE WHAT IS THE MIX OF FACILITIES YOU HAVE. WHAT IS THE CHILDREN'S NEEDS RIGHT NOW WHERE. THERE ARE GAPS IN THAT- CONTINUE ON RIGHT NOW- FOR SOME CHINESE- YOU KNOW THEY ARE STRUGGLING. ONE OF THINGS WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IS WHETHER- FOR VIEW COUNTIES THEY WILL NEED A TRANSITIONAL. SHELTER FACILITY TO BE LICENSED AND THOSE WOULD BE REALLY- WE HAVE HAD A- QUESTIONS FROM A FEW COUNTIES. TO THOSE UP AND WHAT DOES REALLY DO IS PUT GIVE THE COUNTY SOME SPACE AND TIME TO HELP THEM CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THEIR LARGER CAPACITY. AND THE PERMANENT CAPACITY WALL THE TRANSITIONAL SHELTERS GIVING THEM. AN EXTRA A TOOL IN YOUR TOOL BELT AROUND. UNSAFELY HOUSING CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM. SO WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND WORK TO CONTINUE TO DO BUT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IT IN PARTNERSHIP- IN THE DIVISION EXCUSE ME IN THE DEPARTMENT BETWEEN DIVISIONS. AND WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND OUR STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WORK AND HELPING US UNDERSTAND. THE SYSTEM AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS WERE IN THE SYSTEM AT. THE CURRENT USE. SYSTEM IS THAT RIGHT THAT WAS OUR REALLY HELP FOR ME TO UNDER. KIND OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM. WOULD YOU SAY WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT OUR CAPACITY IS RIGHT NOW. NO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I DO THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE- A FAIRLY GOOD MIX OF DISABILITIES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO STAND UP I WOULDN'T SAY- CONFIDENT SAYING THAT EVERY. BECAUSE THE MIX OF EVERY FACILITY THEY NEED. BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS IN OUR TOOL BELT WITH IN OUR CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL LICENSE CAPACITY TO HELP PEOPLE MEET THE NEEDS AND FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION SO THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING SERVED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT- AND- WITH THAT. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- GO TO THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR COMMENT.
