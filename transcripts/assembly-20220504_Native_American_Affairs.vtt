TRUTH BE TOLD WHEN I LOOK AT THE

HER NAME. AS BRIGHT OF A WOMAN

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.211
WHO ONCE PLAYED WITH ME UNDER

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:48.779
THE BLEACHERS AT THE INTER

00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:50.747
TRIBAL ELDERS GATHERING. AND

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.382

HER EYES THAT WERE SO PRETTY.

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.596
THEY MADE HONEY JEALOUS. THEY

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:09.099
LEFT HER FOR DEAD AT THE BOTTOM

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:09.766
OF A HILL TOP. SHE TOO WOULD BE

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:12.335
FOUND BY A STRANGER WHO HAD MORE

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:14.137
COMPASSION THAN THE PERSON. WHO

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:14.704
LEFT HER THERE. THEN LAST

HAVE HAD THE DISTINCTION OF

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:22.739
EXISTING SQUARELY WITHIN. THE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:23.907
CROSSHAIRS OF THE SETTLER

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.575
COLONIAL PROJECT. THEY WERE

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.043
TARGETED. SHE'S ME THEIR

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.912
CAPACITY AS LIFE GIVERS. AND

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.747
SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE KEEPERS. FOR

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:31.882
THE VERY REASONS FOR WHICH THEY

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.817
WERE TARGETED FROM THE FIRST

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:35.285
DAYS OF THE INVASION. AND THEY

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.853
ARE THE REASONS WHY NOW IN

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.421
PRESENT DAY WHEN THEY ARE

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:38.955
HARMED. THEY'RE JUST GO

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:41.258
UNNOTICED UNSOLVED OR WORSE.

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:43.126
MUCH WORK REMAINS ON HIS TOPIC

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.628
THAT BASED ON OUR WORK WITH I

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:47.297
WILL SEE YOU AGAIN IN A GOOD WAY

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.331
WE KNOW SEVERAL THINGS TO BE

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:49.466
TRUE. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:51.067
IN THE TOP FIVE FOR MMI W. P.

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.602
CASES. WITH EIGHTEEN CASES IN

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.204
THE LAST YEAR ALONE IN THE

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.206
STATE. OVER HALF OF THESE CASES

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.074
WERE LOCATED NORTH OF THE BEAR.

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.809
AREAS THOSE CASES OF. FOR WITHIN

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.311
THE- OF THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.046
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THIS MEANS

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.447
THAT JUST ONE RURAL POLICE

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:05.916
DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.918
SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF MMI W. P.

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:10.186
CASES IN THE STATE. YET LIKE

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.855
OTHER RURAL POLICE FORCES. THERE

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:13.523
GENERALLY UNDERFUNDED STRUGGLE

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.559
TO MAINTAIN STAFFING. AND I'M

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.093
GOING TO DATE AND THE ONGOING

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.628
DAILY LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.030
LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR THE VITAL

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.932
WORK OF COLD CASE CLOSURE. NO

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.099
MATTER HOW IMPORTANT THESE CASES

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:24.634
ARE TO THE SHERIFF AND MANY

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.269
OTHERS AND LOCAL LAW

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:27.537
ENFORCEMENT. AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:28.872
THE VERY REAL CONSTRAINTS PLACED

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.407
ON THEM BY RURAL POLICING.

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:31.775
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:32.642
EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.711
CRISIS. NO MATTER THEIR

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:35.946
COMMITMENT OR EFFORTS TO SOLVE

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.847
CASES. RURAL POLICE AND THEIR

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.382
TRAVEL COUNTERPARTS. LACKS THE

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:40.617
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.252
ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.453
AND THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:47.791
BIGGEST RECOMMENDATION.

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:48.792
THANKFULLY PARTNER WITH THE

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.226
TRIBAL NATIONS. THAT SHARE THEIR

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:52.062
JURISDICTION. BY OFFERING THE

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.030
MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO DO SO.

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:55.665
CHIEFLY PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:56.866
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS IT LEFT

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:58.702
TRIBES WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. TO

00:53:58.768 --> 00:54:01.071
FULLY STAFF TRAVEL ON FORSMAN.

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.472
AND WE MUST BETTER SUPPORT THESE

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.808
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AS

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.743
THEY ARE CLOSEST TO THIS CRISIS

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.978
. AT PRESENT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:09.045
THESE NUMBERS ON MISSING AND

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.714
MURDERED ARE CONTEXTUALIZED

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.548
WITHIN GRIEVOUS VIOLENCE AGAINST

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:12.949
INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND INDIGENOUS

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:14.351
BODIES WERE GENERALLY.

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:15.986
INDIGENOUS WOMEN ARE AT A HIGHER

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:16.886
RISK OF INTIMATE PARTNER

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:19.255
VIOLENCE TRAFFICKING. AND MORE

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.590
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SERIOUS

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.626
VIOLENCE KIDNAPPING AND HOMICIDE

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.194
THAN THEIR NON INDIGENOUS

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.228
COUNTERPARTS. HOMICIDE IS THE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.830
THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:27.864
AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.366
NATIVE WOMEN WITH THE VIOLENCE

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.634
EXPERIENCED BY INDIGENOUS WOMEN

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.535
BEING ESPECIALLY SEVERE AND

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:33.770
FREQUENTLY A PRECURSOR TO THEIR

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.672
DISAPPEARANCE OR DEATH. GOING

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:36.973
FURTHER NATIVE WOMEN ARE

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.208
MURDERED MORE LIKELY TO

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:40.176
EXPERIENCE INTERRACIAL VIOLENCE

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.311
WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:43.480
THAN INTRA RACIAL VIOLENCE. MORE

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.981
OFTEN THAN NOT WHEN INDIVIDUALS

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.516
ARE VICTIMIZED IS TYPICALLY BY

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:48.351
SOMEONE OF THEIR SAME RACE. THIS

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:49.419
IS NOT THE CASE FOR INDIGENOUS

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.254
WOMEN ARE PERPETRATORS ARE MORE

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:52.956
LIKELY TO BE NON NATIVE. AND

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.491
AGAIN THAT'S LINKING BACK TO THE

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:56.159
SETTLER COLONIAL LEGACY WHERE

00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:57.761
OUR BODIES ARE THE LANDSCAPE BY

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:59.896
WHICH COLONIAL VIOLENCE HAS BEEN

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.831
AND CONTINUES TO BE WAGED. OUR

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:03.433
FOUNDING MYTHS ARE BUTTRESSED BY

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.435
DISGUSTING TRUTH IF YOU HARMON

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:06.870
INDIGENOUS WOMEN YOU ARE MORE

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:08.705
LIKELY TO GET AWAY WITH IT. WE

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.640
ENSCONCED THIS IN LINE EVEN

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.275
RESERVATIONS IS CASE IN POINT

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.109
ARE AREAS RIFE WITH

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:14.811
JURISDICTIONAL LOOPHOLES LEGAL

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:16.513
COMPLEXITIES AND ULTIMATELY

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:18.548
CRIMINAL SILENCE. ROVING SERIAL

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:19.983
KILLERS OF WHICH THE FBI

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.018
ESTIMATES ARE OVER FIFTEEN

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:23.253
HUNDRED CIRCULATING IN OUR

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.921
NATION AT THIS VERY MOMENT. AND

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:25.922
ALL THOSE OTHERS WHO WOULD DO

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:27.924
HARM TO WOMEN SEEK OUT THESE

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.459
PLACES AND THE BODIES OF WOMEN

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.194
LIKE ME WHO LIVE THERE BECAUSE

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:32.762
THEY KNOW THEY WILL NOT GET

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.431
CAUGHT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:35.932
NUMBERS IT'S HARD TO DISPUTE

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:36.833
THIS INTERPRETATION MURDERS OF

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.034
NATIVE WOMEN IN THE STATE ARE

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.669
SEVEN TIMES LESS LIKELY TO BE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:42.639
SOLVED IN SIMILAR CASES WITH NON

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:43.840
NATIVE VICTIMS. EVEN WITH SUCH

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:45.208
TRENDS WE KNOW THE STATE IS ONLY

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.010
A FIRST GLANCE. AND AS A PROJECT

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:49.012
WE ARE LEFT SIFTING THROUGH WHAT

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.346
DATA DO EXIST TO BETTER SPEAK TO

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.848
THIS CRISIS. EVEN AS SO MANY

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.283
FAMILIES AND SURVIVORS KNOW IT

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.552
WELL BEYOND THE CAPACITY FOR ANY

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.554
METRIC TO FULLY CAPTURE. DRAWN

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.955
FROM THE DATA AND THE LESSON

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.690
SHARED WITH THIS BIG HE

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:01.524
STAKEHOLDERS WE OVERWHELMINGLY

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:02.726
UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO DO THE

00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:04.060
HARD WORK OF ESTABLISHING THE

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.729
PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS. THAT

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.530
ARE UNIQUE TO THIS MATTER IN

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:09.733
PARTICULAR BUT ALSO RELEVANT TO

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.534
CALL CASES AT LARGE. ACCORDING

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:12.402
TO THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:13.503

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.805
ISSUES ON M. M. I. W. P. WE ARE

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.941
IN A CRISIS OF COLD CASES IN

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:18.408
THIS COUNTRY AND THIS

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.476
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS.

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:22.112
INDIGENOUS WOMEN AS WE MAKE UP A

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:22.779
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THESE

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.014
OPEN CASES. ULTIMATELY WE NEED

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:26.516
TO INVEST THE RESOURCES INTO

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:27.884
ESTABLISHING A VARIETY OF

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.586
MECHANISMS. FROM BEFORE SOMEONE

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:31.454
IS TAKEN AFTER THEY'RE MISSING

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:34.357

DUE FOR RELEASE IN JULY WE WILL

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:39.863
TAKE A FIRST STEP IN DESIGNING

00:56:39.929 --> 00:56:41.998
SUCH PROTOCOLS. AS PART OF A

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:42.966

DRESSING THE MMI W. P. CRISIS

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:49.806
WILL MAKE THESE RESOURCES

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:52.475
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AND ALL

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:53.843
OTHER TRIBES. AS A BE READY FOR

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.044

ALL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. SOMEONE

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.918
RECENTLY ASKED ME WHAT DOES IT

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.753
MATTER THAT THE YUROK TRIBE IS

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.221
MOVING ON THIS ISSUE. WHAT CAN

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:06.790
ONE LITTLE TRIBE DUE. TO WHICH I

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.958
REPLIED THERE IS NO LITTLE TRIBE

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.060
IN A STATE LIKE OURS. CALIFORNIA

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.262
IS BY SOME ACCOUNTS THE FIFTH

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.963
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD NOT

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.698
JUST THE NATION. WHEN WE TAKE

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.467
THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND WE MAKE

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:18.601
INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:19.869
THIS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:21.504
THE WHOLE OF INDIAN COUNTRY AND

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:22.872
PERHAPS GLOBAL INDIGENOUS

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.541

BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN WHEN

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:33.049
CALIFORNIA MOVES ON THIS ISSUE.

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.317
AND THAT COULD BE A TEMPLATE FOR

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.752
SO MUCH. REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:36.886

THESE EFFORTS. AND THESE

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.478
TEACHINGS ARE JUST FOR US.

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.580
THERE'S POWERFUL MEDICINE HERE

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:04.814
THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH SO

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:05.915
MANY COMMUNITIES IN SIMILAR

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:08.918
CONDITIONS. WE NEED TO ACT NOW.

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:10.687
IN CLOSING I MUST REMIND YOU

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.222
THAT NO DATA ANYWHERE CAN FULLY

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:13.823
CAPTURE WHAT IS LOST WHEN OUR

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.358
RELATIVES ARE TAKEN. OUR NUMBERS

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:16.826
NO MATTER HOW DIRE. CAN ONLY

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.628
FALL SHORT OF SHOWING HOW MUCH

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.630
IS LOST WITH EACH INDIGENOUS

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.065
LIFE. FAR TOO OFTEN AS SOCIAL

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.033
SCIENTISTS WE TALK ABOUT DATA

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.768
ESPECIALLY HARD NUMBERS. AS SOME

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.470
KIND OF GOLD STANDARD. I KNOW

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.105
FIRST HAND HOW THIS CAN NEVER BE

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:31.140
THE CASE NOR THE AND ALL. WHEN

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.709
IT COMES TO THIS EPIDEMIC. EVEN

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.711
AS WE FASHION STUDY INSTRUMENTS

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:36.679
TO CAPTURE THIS CRISIS. EVEN THE

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:38.014
BEST TOOL FAILED TO CAPTURE THE

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.216

RANCHERIA IT IS SOMETHING THAT I

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.068
THINK IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.104
MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.773
COMMUNITY NO ONE HAS THE ABILITY

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.476
TO POLICE THEIR OWN TO GET OUT

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.845
IN IN INTO THE RURAL AREAS OF

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.980
OUR COUNTY AND TO HAVE. THE

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.682
ABILITY TO ENFORCE STATE LAW AS

SHERIFF'S OF EACH COUNTY. AND IT

IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.959
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE DOING

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.727
HERE IN HUMBLE COUNTY IS MAKING

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:45.561

TRIBES TO TRY AND CHANGE THE

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.538
LAW. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE VERY

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.473
BENEFICIAL I THINK THE TIME IS

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.108
NOW. TO CHANGE THE LAW TO ALLOW

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:01.878
TRAVEL OFFICERS TO BECOME POST

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.112

TRIBAL LAND. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.151
THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR- I'VE

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.418
TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.388
IT AND WE ARE THERE TO SUPPORT

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.124
THAT AND SUPPORT THAT IF IT DOES

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:18.828
COME TO A- THE ASSEMBLY FOR AND

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.930
THE LAWS CHANGED- IN THE

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:23.633
MEANTIME. COMMUNICATION

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:24.867
COLLABORATION- WE'VE HAD A

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.502
RECENT CASE THAT DOCTOR GEORGE

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:27.970
REFERRED TO AS A MISSING PERSON

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:30.139
BACK IN IN THE FALL AND IT'S A

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.942
VERY. HEART WRENCHING STORY.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.878
AND- AND SO. WE WANT TO DO OUR

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:38.481
BEST. IN THESE SITUATIONS AND

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.316
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE YUROK

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.385
TRIBE HOOPA TRIBE IN HUMBLE

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.019
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE COMING

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.922
TOGETHER. AND WORKING TOGETHER

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.924
TO TRY AND SOLVE A MISSING

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.059
PERSONS CASE- UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.561
DON'T HAVE RESOLUTION OF THAT

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.095
CASE BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.231
ARE. DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:58.434
TO TRY AND FIND HER RIGHT NOW-

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.869
AND THAT'S INCLUDING BRING IN

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:02.038
OUTSIDE RESOURCES- TALKING THE

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.906
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. THE

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.809
FBI- EVERY KIND OF RESOURCE WE

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.844
POSSIBLY CAN BRING IN TO SOLVE

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.813
THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S GONNA

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.382
TAKE BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.851
DO SOMETHING BUT IT'S ALSO

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:16.852
BUILDING TRUST WITHIN THE

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:17.520
COMMUNITIES. ONE THING WE

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.655
RECOGNIZE IS THAT THE

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.090
GENERATIONAL DISTRUST WITH LAW

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.392
ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.261
WAS FORCED ON THE TRIBES THIS

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.129
WASN'T ASKED FOR. THIS WASN'T

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.731
COLLABORATED WITH IT WAS FORCED

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:31.367
ON THE TRIBES OF THE STATE- AND

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.736
SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IS WORK

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:35.204
WITH THE TRIBES ARE TRYING TO

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.707
BUILD TRUST. AND THAT HAPPENS

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.542
ONE CASE AT A TIME IT DOESN'T

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.143
MEAN THAT WE'RE GONNA DO THINGS

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.144
CORRECTLY EVERY TIME IT'S

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:43.779
IMPOSSIBLE BUT THERE IS

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.748
MECHANISM IS NOW. THAT NGUYEN

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.850
MISTAKES FROM WHEN THINGS NEED

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:48.718
TO BE ADDRESSED THAT WE CAN

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:50.453
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THOSE WITH EACH

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.321
OTHER HAVING REGULAR CHECK INS

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.123

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.392
WITH REGULAR CHECK INS WITH THE

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.094
TRIBAL POLICE CHIEFS WITH THE

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:58.861
COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:00.296
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.265
NECESSARY THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:03.666
IS HAVING THE SHERIFF'S OR LAW

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.001
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT IN

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.502
CHARGE OF THAT JURISDICTION TO

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.004

TO WHAT'S GOING ON THE GROUND

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:14.510
BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR. ON MY END

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.379
COULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:16.879
THAN WHAT THE COMMUNITY

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.547
UNDERSTANDS AND HEARS. AND SO

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.116
THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.651
COMMITTED TO AND THAT'S ONE

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.552
THING THAT WE ARE WE ARE WANTING

LOCALLY WE HAVE TO START THERE

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.075
AND WE HAVE TO PUSH INFORMATION

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.843
OUT WE HAVE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.578
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN THE

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.846
FOREFRONT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.981
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:26.716
STILL LOOKING- THE ONE THING

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.751
THAT WAS ON THE- THE SECOND

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.187
REPORTED IN THE MY W. WAS MAKING

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.222
SURE THAT EACH JURISDICTION HAS

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:36.926
THE HAS COLD CASES ADVERTISED SO

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.394
WE CAN KEEP THE INFORMATION ON

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.029

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.507
OUR CASES AND WE'RE ASKING FOR

WITNESSES TO COME FORWARD.

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.280
BECAUSE WE'VE WE KNOW PEOPLE

NOTICE THINGS. AT TIMES AND THEY

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:02.051
JUST REFUSED TO COME FORWARD AND

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.919
I THINK PART OF THAT IS BUILDING

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:04.954
TRUST. WITHIN COMMUNITIES SO

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.490
THEY NOW WE DID HAVE. A MISSING

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:10.593
PERSONS CASE IN WHO BOUGHT. LAST

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.528
YEAR- WHERE GEMMA WENT MISSING.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:17.266
AND HIS CAR WAS FOUND. AND AFTER

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.567
THE INFORMATION WAS PUT OUT

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.035
THERE. COMMITTEE MEMBER STARTED

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:22.838
COMING FORWARD. AND THROUGH

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.607
COMMUNITY MEMBERS BEEN ABLE TO

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.275
TELL US WHAT THEY KNEW WE WERE

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:29.545
ABLE TO ROUTE IT BACK TO WHERE

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.614
THE VICTIM WAS LOCATED. DECEASED

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.783
AS WELL AS ARREST THE PEOPLE

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:36.819
THAT MURDERED HIM. AND SO THAT'S

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.088
ONE CASE. BUT THAT'S ONE THING

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.222
CASE THAT BUILDS TRUST WITHIN

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.824
THE COMMUNITY WE WANT TO

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.592
CONTINUE TO CARRY THAT FORWARD

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.328
AND TRY TO DO MORE. BUT AGAIN

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.297
IT'S GONNA TAKE ONE CASE AT A

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.932
TIME. AND AND SO I'M HERE TO

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.000
ANSWER QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:53.335
COLLABORATE AND- AND DO WHATEVER

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:54.970
WE CAN BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:57.540
DR GEORGE- AND THE REPORT THAT

01:07:57.606 --> 01:08:00.042
THEY THAT THEY PUSH OUT EVERY-

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.845
EVERY COUPLE MONTHS. IT IS

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.814
IMPORTANT WE DO KEEP THIS IN THE

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.917
FOREFRONT. FOLLOW UP QUESTION

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:11.787
TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR POINT

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.989
IS RIGHT ON CUE IN TERMS OF HOW

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:16.058
THE MEDIA PORTRAYS CERTAIN

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.093
STORIES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.695
INDIGENOUS WOMEN OR WOMEN OF

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.464
COLOR AND GENERALLY WHEN. GONE

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.799
MISSING OR A CERTAIN KIND OF

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.968
CASES NOT AS ELEVATED AS IT IS A

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:29.004
WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND- WE

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.039
KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WHAT THAT

01:08:30.105 --> 01:08:32.374
LOOKS LIKE- MY QUESTION IS THE

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.843
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.878
DEPARTMENT OF- THE ATTORNEY

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.613
GENERAL. AS WELL AS LAW

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.048
ENFORCEMENT AS TO WHAT YOU SEE

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.616
OUR POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.652
TERMS OF HOW- YOU KNOW EVERY

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.087
TRIBE A RESERVATION AS ITS OWN

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.389
SOVEREIGN NATION. SO THEN HOW

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.492
CAN WE COLLABORATE AS A STATE IN

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.927
IMPACTFUL LEGISLATION THAT

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:54.763
SUPPORTS JUSTICE AND SAFETY.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:56.499
WELL NOT IMPOSING ON TRIBAL

01:08:56.565 --> 01:09:00.035
SOVEREIGNTY AND WHAT THAT COULD

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:00.936
POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE. THAT'S A

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.805
GREAT QUESTION- BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.707
AND WE DO NOT WANT TO STEP ON

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.774
TOES. AND WE WANT TO WORK

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.776
TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT COMES

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.144
FROM HIS PLACE OF RESPECT I

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:11.247
THINK HAVING EACH TRIBE EVALUATE

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.015
THEIR OWN NEEDS AND FIGURE OUT

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.784
WHAT THEY- NEED BECAUSE EACH

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:20.322
TRIBAL- ENTITY HAS. THE ABILITY

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.558
TO SELF GOVERNED SELF POLICE-

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:26.262
AND EACH EACH- EACH TRIBE. HAS

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.763
IN A DIFFERENT STAGE OF THAT YOU

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.131
WITH ANYONE EVEN WITHIN OUR OWN

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.699
COUNTY WE HAVE DIFFERENT STAGES

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.568
OF TRIBAL POLICE. AND SO WHAT

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.837
THE YUROK. NEEDS BABY IS

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.739
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT BLUE LAKE

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.874
NEEDS AND SO I THINK HAVING A

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.977
CHECK IN WITH THEM AND- WITH DOJ

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:45.114
WITH MYSELF WITH THE FBI. AND

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.384
COMMUNICATE EXACTLY WHAT THEY

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.552
NEED IS PROBABLY THAT THE RIGHT

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.654
THING TO DO. IT WOULD NEED TO BE

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.156
LED BY THE TRIBES- AND AS I

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.792
MENTIONED- THERE'S OVER A

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.861
HUNDRED RESERVATIONS- AND

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.363
THERE'S- THE RESERVATIONS ARE

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.732
BORDERED BY THIRTY FOUR OF OUR

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.401
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THIRTY

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.135
FOUR SHERIFF'S- AND THAT

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.604
COORDINATION. AND RELATIONSHIP

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.573
BUILDING- BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:14.043
HISTORICAL TENSIONS- JUSTIFIED-

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:17.212
A LOT OF DISTRESSED ISSUES- BUT-

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:21.417
AS- EVERY TRIBE- HAS. INHERENT

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:25.054
SOVEREIGNTY- AND THEY HAVE

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.989
CONCURRENT CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:31.627
SO THE TRIBES CAN- THEY CAN

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.495
IMPOSE OUR OWN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:37.199
SYSTEMS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:41.303
NOW- BUT AS SURE CONSULATES ST

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:46.175
IT'S GOING TO TAKE- A LOT OF. AS

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:49.678
PART IN NATION- AND SHARING OF

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.947
INFORMATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW-

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:54.283
THERE'S NOT ANY REAL SHARING OF

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.185
INFORMATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:58.854
ENFORCEMENT AND THE TRIBES- AND

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.557
SO WE NEED TO BUILD BACK KIND OF

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:05.995
PIPELINE- FIRST SO I'M HOPING-

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:10.866
THAT. DR GEORGE OF SHE GETS THE

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.469
START WORKING- ON OUR STUDY COME

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:20.142
JULY. WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR YUROK

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.144
. I THINK IF I COULD AND I THINK

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.779
IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT THE TRIBES

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:26.148
ARE SEEN AS A COLLABORATOR IN A

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.516
RESOURCE IN THIS MATTER

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:28.984
TRUTHFULLY THERE'S SOME THINGS

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:31.754
THAT ONLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.756
AND I THINK. YOU KNOW I'M CLOSE

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.691
TO THIS ISSUE AND THERE'S PEOPLE

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.860
EVEN CLOSER STILL WHO ARE ON OUR

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:38.761
PROJECT TEAM LOOKING FOR THEIR

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:41.230
RELATIVES AND- AND THAT IS

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:43.599
ACTUALLY THE STATE OF THIS ISSUE

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.267
I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS FOR MOST

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:46.935
TRIBES IT WILL TRY TO. LOOK INTO

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.904
THIS ISSUE AND ANY OR EXIT

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.239
REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS WE ARE

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.207
OFTEN ONLY ONE OR TWO PEOPLE

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.542
REMOVED. AND I THINK THAT OFTEN

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.077
THEIR TRIBES ARE AT A LOSS OF

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.346
WHERE TO START. AND END YEARS

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.081
ONE AND TWO AND IN YEAR THREE WE

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.849
ACTUALLY SHARE STUDY INSTRUMENTS

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.317
OF THE TRIBES THEMSELVES CAN

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.219
START COLLECTING THIS DATA GET

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.421
THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF WHAT

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.322
IT LOOKS LIKE IN THEIR

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:07.956
COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WHEN THEY

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.825
GO TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:11.593
AND JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY HAVE

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.762
SOME SOMETHING TO GO ON AND

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.431
AREN'T STARTING FROM SCRATCH I

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.100
THINK SO. AS MUCH AS WE ASK

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.535
TRIBES TO LEAD THE WAY WE HAVE

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:20.669
TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE DOING SO

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.905
WITHIN A VASTLY UNDER RESOURCE

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.441
CONTACTS AND SO MAKING RESOURCES

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.775
AVAILABLE FOR THIS ISSUE IN

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.410
PARTICULAR WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.712
START ESTABLISHING THOSE BASS

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.880
LINES WHICH IN TURN CAN INFORM

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.283

MY WHOLE JAM BUT I DO THINK IT

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.786
STARTS WITH BEING ABLE TO

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.354

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:42.224
TRIBAL ACCESS TO THIS IMPORTANT

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.759
DATA ON OUR MEMBERSHIP. A LOT OF

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:46.161
ITS EDUCATION AS WELL AND

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.730
PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES. SO

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.898
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- IS

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:51.200

TRIBES- PROVIDING THE TOOL KITS

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:56.138

IF THEY HAVE HAD A MISSING LEVEL

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.877

TYPE OF RESOURCES THAT

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.300

COLLECTIVE MEETING ALTOGETHER-

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.649

AGE. YOU KNOW WE CAN PULL THIS

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.589
OFF AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT-

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.324
ALL ON TALK TO MARY ABOUT AND

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.293
MAYBE EVEN REGIONALLY I MEAN AS

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.727
YOU SAID IT'S COUNTY BY COUNTY

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:36.631

OTHER AREAS BUT THAT CERTAINLY

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.943
DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.711
ISSUES AND IT COULD ALSO MEAN

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.047
THAT WHEN THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.582
WHO GO MISSING THEY AND

MAKE SURE OTHERS DO AS WELL- BUT

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:08.863
I THINK. REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.298
REALLY GIVE A WHOLE KIND OF

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.901
REGIONAL STATEWIDE OPPORTUNITY

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:16.972
TO- CONVENE AT SOME POINT. IF I

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:20.008
MAY ADD I WOULD SAY THAT I'M THE

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:24.946
TYPE OF RESEARCH FIRST EVE. I

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:25.981
STATE PROJECT WE ACTUALLY

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:28.483
STARTED THE PROJECT ON THE EVE

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.784
OF THE PANDEMIC SO HAD IN A VERY

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.052
DIFFERENT. AND HAD TO STILL JUMP

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:33.221
IN AND ESTABLISH THE SCOPE AND

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:34.556
SEVERITY AND- FOR TWENTY

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:35.590
NINETEEN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN TO

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:36.925
NOW. WE HAVE SEEN THE

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.426
COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.862
PROJECT- THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:43.565
IT'S BOTH WAYS WHEN WE NEED

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.268
HELP. WE CAN CALL AND VICE VERSA

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:48.203
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A REAL

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.505
TEMPLATE TO MODEL I DON'T WANT

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.806
TO SINGLE ANYONE OUT BUT I WILL

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:53.808

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:54.809

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.077
VARIETY OF COUNTIES. MANY

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:57.812
DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.581
THAT WAS NOT ALWAYS THE RESPONSE

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.082
THAT WHEN WE CALLED AND ASKED

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.417

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.186
SEEN. AS WORTHY OF THAT TIME OR

OR SOMETIMES THE- WE WERE COMING

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:10.258
IN A GOOD WAY I THINK THAT'S

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:11.092
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:12.127
WHEN TRIBES COME TO COLLABORATE

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.696

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.269
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL AND I HOPE

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:24.339

THIS LAST YEAR WE WERE WORKING

WITH VETERANS GROUPS. AND THEY

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.699

SAID YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T AN

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.101
ALERT SYSTEM WHEN THERE ARE

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:10.037

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:14.741

CHILDREN AND THERE MAY BE

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:20.213
SEVERAL OTHERS. AND SO WE WERE

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.682
EXCITED AND MOVING IN THE

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:23.583
DIRECTION OF POTENTIALLY PUTTING

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.218
FORWARD LEGISLATION AS RELATED

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:28.522
TO- WHAT THEY WANTED TO CALL THE

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:31.458
GREENER FOR VETERANS. WE ROLLED

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:32.626
UP OUR SLEEVES AND WE STARTED

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:34.761
TALKING TO ACTUAL VETERAN

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.230
GROUPS. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:38.498
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.500
CONCERNED AS IT RELATES TO

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:42.669
VETERANS WHO SUFFER FROM PTSD

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:47.340
AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:48.508
THAT THE MINUTE THAT WE PUT OUT

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:51.411
A NUMBER- LOOKING FOR A VETERAN

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:52.646
THAT THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:56.783
VERY. ADVERSE AFFECT. APPLES AND

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.385
ORANGES DIFFERENT POPULATIONS

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.253
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. JUST

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.355
WONDERING IF THERE ARE ANY

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:05.158
THOUGHTS ON. ON PROS AND CONS OF

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.893
THE ALERT SYSTEM I CAN'T THINK

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.762
OF ANY. I THINK IT WOULD ALL BE

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:11.064
A VERY GOOD TO CREATE THE WORD

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:12.666
IS A SOMEONE IS MISSING- FROM

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.334
THE RESERVATION. BUT RIGHT AWAY

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.403
WE PUT THE BRAKES. RIGHT AWAY WE

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:17.971
PUT THE BRAKES ON THAT ISSUE

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.941
BECAUSE OF FROM SPEAKING TO- YOU

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:21.908
KNOW THE VETERANS DIRECTLY THEY

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:23.877
SAID. THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:27.047
IDEA RIGHT SO I DON'T SEE ANY

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:31.084
ANY- OTHER REASONS WHY NOT TO DO

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.919
THIS BUT I'VE JUST WILL I REALLY

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.721
LIKE THE IDEA THAT'S WHY BRING

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:36.256
IT UP AND- AND I THINK THAT'S

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:37.958
WHY THE CHAIRMAN CAME IN THE

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.292
STING CARE QUICK. THEY'LL RUN

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.294
WITH IT BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:44.097
IN PARTNERSHIP IN REGARDS. IT

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:47.601
DEFINITELY IS- ANYBODY WANNA TRY

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:50.270
AND I'LL JUST- QUICK SAY

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.072
SOMETHING QUICK- THANK YOU FOR

01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:54.508
THE QUESTION- I SEE NOTHING BUT

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.309
PROS FOR IT I DON'T SEE ANY CONS

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:58.645
AND AGAIN IT COULD BE- SOME OF

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:01.281
OUR TRIBAL PEOPLE ARE VERY-

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:03.350
RELUCTANT TO TELL THOSE STORIES

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:05.719
BUT I THINK JUST- PUTTING ALERT

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:06.987
ALERT LETTING THEM KNOW THAT

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:09.156
SOMEBODY'S MISSING I DON'T SEE

01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:12.626
ANY CONS TO THAT AT ALL AND

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:15.295
MAYBE MY OTHER. TRAVEL HOW ONCE

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:17.731
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:19.699
THERE MAY BE SOME NEGATIVES BUT

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:21.234
I'M WE CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:23.236
INDIGENOUS PERSON HERE BUT THE

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:26.139
POSITIVES FAR OUTWEIGH THOSE-

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:28.341
AGAIN IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. FOR

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:29.943
THAT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL THAT

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.478
HAS GONE MISSING BUT ALSO THEIR

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.446
FAMILIES IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.981
ALSO RELIEVE PRESSURE FROM THEM

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:36.983
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE WE HAVE A

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:37.818
STATEWIDE SYSTEM OUR STATE

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:40.153
LEGISLATORS. LEGISLATORS CARE

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.755
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.390
IMPLEMENT SOME TYPE OF ALERT SO

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:45.058
AGAIN IT'S NOT ONLY THE

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.860
PERSPECTIVE OF THOSE WHO HAVE

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:48.195
GONE MISSING BUT THEIR FAMILIES

01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:50.063

QUIRK-SILVA. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.405
AFFECT OF USES OF THE LURCH IS

01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:00.807
THAT WE KNOW THAT- YOU HAVE THE

AND THAT'S WHY IT HAS BEEN SO

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.718
EFFECTIVE SO I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:14.521

TRYING TO BE PREVENTIVE DOMESTIC

VIOLENCE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:38.511
THAT. THE DATA IS BEING SHARED

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:40.914
WITH WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.918
TO- INVESTIGATE THESE TYPES OF

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.953
SITUATIONS- I'M WHAT I LIKE TO

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:50.823
SAID. THE A LOT. I THINK JUST-

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:52.392
THE ACCESS TO THOSE

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:54.761
INFORMATIONAL DATABASES YOU KNOW

01:53:54.827 --> 01:53:56.062
WHEN SOMEBODY GOES MISSING THE

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.398
TRIBE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:53:58.464 --> 01:53:59.299
ACCESS TO. THE TAB FOR THE CLIPS

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:01.467
AND UNFORTUNATELY- AT THAT LEVEL

01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:03.403
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS INTO. I

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:05.171
BELIEVE I'M A KLUTZ I BELIEVE

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:07.707
I'M SAYING IT RIGHT- BUT WE DO

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:09.776
HAVE ACCESS INTO THE TAP- BUT I

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:11.211
BELIEVE MAYBE MORE ACCESS FOR

01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:14.447
ALL TRIBES. NOT JUST- JUST VERY

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.816
FEEL AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE VERY

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.685
ONE OF THE VERY FEW TO HAVE

01:54:18.751 --> 01:54:20.019
ACCESS TO THAT AND- THAT%

01:54:20.086 --> 01:54:20.954
INFORMATION IS WHEN THERE'S

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.288
SOMEBODY THAT'S MISSING THAT

01:54:22.355 --> 01:54:23.723
INFORMATION GOES DIRECTLY INTO

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.959
THAT DATABASE. AND IT GETS PUT

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.827
OUT TO ALL TRIBAL ENFORCEMENT

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:29.862
AND ON LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.564
TROUBLE BUT STATE AND LOCAL

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.533
OFFICIALS AND I THINK AGAIN-

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.468
WHEN YOU WE LIVE IN A RURAL

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.869
AREA. THAT'S THE MOST VITAL TO

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:38.271
GET OUT THAT INFORMATION AS SOON

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:40.206
AS POSSIBLE- YOU KNOW HAVE.

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:41.975
OFFICERS AND HIGHWAY PATROL

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:44.978
LOOKING ON FREEWAYS- BUT I THINK

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:46.279
TO WITH THE COURTS I THINK-

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:47.714
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.616
WORKING ON A WE'VE BEEN REALLY

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:52.752
SUCCESSFUL HATS HOLD. ON AND I

01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:58.858
JUST DOES IT WE DON'T HAVE THAT. SOMETHING HAS BEEN VERY

01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:01.394
HELPFUL FOR US. THANK YOU ANY

01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:03.429
ANY OTHER WITH WISH TO COME ON

01:55:03.496 --> 01:55:04.897
YEAH I WANTED TO SHARE THAT I

01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:05.932
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THERE

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.500
BE A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.636
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.738
TRIBES AND YOU KNOW OUR- URBAN

01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:13.206
INDIAN HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.241
BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST HAVE LAW

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:17.377
ENFORCEMENT HOLDING THE DATA. AS

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:19.012
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:21.214
STILL IS SOME DISTRUST THERE AND

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:22.882
UNTIL WE HEAL THAT UNTIL WE

01:55:22.949 --> 01:55:24.484
BUILD THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THEN WE

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:27.186
CAN HAVE- YOU KNOW A LARGER

01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:29.555
DATABASE THAT CAN- PROVIDE

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:31.758
SUPPORT TO TWO TRIBES IN INTO

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.660
EVERYONE. BUT I THINK THAT IT

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:36.195
WOULD BE GREAT IF WE WERE ABLE

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:38.898
TO SEE- PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIS

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:42.035
DATA SHARING SO THAT- WE CAN.

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:43.503
BECAUSE I THINK TOO THAT'S WHERE

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:45.038
THE TRAINING COMES BACK INTO IN

01:55:45.104 --> 01:55:46.706
MAKING SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.708
HAS THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY NATIVE

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:51.044
PEOPLE AND WE SEE THAT EVEN

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:53.012
WITHIN ARGUES WHO ARE. SAY

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:55.682
MISSING A LOT OF TIMES- THEY

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:59.218
HAD. THEIR LOOKED AT AS A RUN

01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:00.453
AWAY AND- IS EITHER

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.188
MISIDENTIFIED AND THEN THE NEXT

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:03.823
THING YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN DAYS

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.358
AFTER GONE BY. AND THAT YOU

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.959
THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN TRAFFICKED

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.027
AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM SO I

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:09.829
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:56:09.896 --> 01:56:11.331
GO BACK TO THOSE BASIC OF-

01:56:11.397 --> 01:56:13.599
TRAINING IT. AND CULTURAL

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:15.968
COMPETENCY IN JUST AND- JUST

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:17.804
PARTNERING IT AND MAKING SURE

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:19.172
THAT WE'RE BUILDING THOSE

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.340

01:58:07.647 --> 01:58:08.214
GOOD QUESTION- BUT MAYBE- WITH

THE SHERIFF I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:11.050
STILL HERE BUT MAYBE HE MIGHT

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:12.618
HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON THAT

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:13.886
I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN

PARTICULAR CONVERSATION MIGHT MY

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:20.126
EXPERIENCE THE- TO TRIBAL YOU

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:22.395

BACK HOME. AND THERE WAS AN

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:31.437
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SHAKE THAT UP

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:32.705
BUT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:35.808
THERE MAY BE AN NARAL- FOCUSED

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:37.844
AREA FOR THE FACT OF SHARING

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:40.546
INFORMATION AND DATA ON THIS

01:58:40.613 --> 01:58:42.048

01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:52.959
CAN DO FROM A LEGISLATIVE

01:58:53.025 --> 01:58:54.794

BEING AVAILABLE TO OUR SOVEREIGN

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:05.838
NATIONS. OKAY AGAIN I THINK GO

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:08.774

VERY ON EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.678

THERE'S A THEY'RE A LITTLE

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.381

THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T ALLOW

THAT CONTINUE DIALOGUE IS

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:30.455
IMPERATIVE TO RESOLVING THIS

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.438
THIS IS GOING TO BE ITERATIVE
