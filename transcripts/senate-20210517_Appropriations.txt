YES MY NAME IS PAUL MCGOVERN WHY AMERICA THIS BILLS AMONG ALL OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY PROCESSED FOR TO DAY AND HERE IS ANOTHER FACT THAT WE NEED TO READ INTO THE RECORD. WE HAVE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGETS WITHIN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO ENABLE A BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED EVEN DURING COVERT NINETEEN TIMES IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE WORK FROM HOME SOME PEOPLE WORK IN THE OFFICE. THAT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE HERE'S WHAT'S UNREASONABLE WHEN YOU TRY TO CALL SOMEONE IT DIAL JUST GOES DIRECTLY TO THEIR PERSONAL CELL PHONE NUMBER WHICH DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO TAKE VOICE MAIL MESSAGES WELL I CALLED THE COMMITTEE FROM MAY SIXTH EVERY SINGLE DAY FORWARD. I GOT A MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE CELL PHONE SAYING WELL WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MESSAGES THE MAILBOX IS FULL. NO ONE DECIDED TO CLEAR THE MESSAGES NO ONE DECIDED TO ACTUALLY CHECK ANYTHING THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH THE OFFICIAL NUMBER THAT'S ON THE WEBSITE. THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN YOU CAN EASILY FIX THIS BY PUTTING A BUSINESS LINE AT EVERY PLACE OF BUSINESS WHERE PEOPLE SET EVEN IF IT'S THEIR HOME. AND YOU CAN SAY FOR SURE. CONNECT YOU TO THEIR EXTENSION AND THEN IT WILL FALL OVER TO THE OTHER LINE AND THERE WILL BE ENOUGH SPACE TO LEAVE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. NO ONE RESPONSE TO YOU. NUMBER RESPONSE THE VOICE MAILS I GOT MAYBE TOO. OKAY THIS IS REALLY A BROKEN PROCESS I HAVEN'T FULLY DOCUMENTED YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM HARRY LEHMANN ON MAY TENTH. SHOWING YOU WHERE THIS IS VIOLATING MANY RULES AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX THIS BROKEN PROCESS.

IT TESTIFYING OPPOSITION OF SB SIXTY EIGHT. PLEASE COME FORWARD SIR PINE PAUL. YES THIS FARMING HAVE WIRE AMERICA AGAIN SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL THE BILLS TODAY AND THE HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE WITHIN THESE COMMITTEES THESE COMMITTEES TAKE YEAH AND VERY SIGNIFICANT ANALYSIS LETTERS THAT ARE EIGHT TO TEN PAGES LONG THAT ACTUALLY SHOWED MUCH SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ON THE RECORD WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO APPROVE SOME OF THESE BILLS THAT HAVE VERY SEVERE STE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS YET THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT INTO THE ANALYSIS. RIGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN READ THAT STUFF BECAUSE AUGUST SUMMARIZED INTO A LITTLE PARAGRAPH THIS IS ALL. IT'S KIND OF A CONCERN. WE ARE NOT PUTTING CONCERNS INTO THE RECORD WE ARE PUTTING SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD IT'S IN THE BILL FILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT ONLY HAS TO LOOK AT THE BILL FILE. AND SO HERE WE ARE TRYING TO GET GOOD INFORMATION INTO THE HANDS OF SENATORS WHO NEED TO DELIBERATE. AND MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ON THESE BILLS YES THE PUBLI IS CUT OUT ONCE AGAIN. I THINK WE CAN FIX THIS BY ZOOM YOU CAN DO THIS BY MAKING THESE MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE BY ZOOM.

DISCLOSURES TO BE. INCORPORATED INTO EVERY BILL THAT WE HAVE ON THE CALENDAR BECAUSE I GET THE SENSE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIONS THEIR- ROUTINE NOT TO PROTECT PARTICULAR MERITS OF THE BILL IT'S A PROCESS. IF THAT'S OKAY. CERTAINLY YOU MIKE MY GOAL HERE IN MY COMMENTS IS NOT TO DUPLICATE ANY SINGLE ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE NEW IN GOOD SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION EVERY COMMENT THAT I MAKE I'M NOT HERE TO WASTE YOUR TIME. I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING IS THE PUBLIC HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. WE HAVE SOME KIND OF CODED NINETEEN QUOTE ON QUOTE PROTOCOL THAT SEEMS TO BE ENFORCED AS IF IT WERE LAW THIS IS NOT LAW. ALL OF THESE PROTOCOL THINGS HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY DISMISSED BY MANY STATES. RETURNEES JUST WALK UP AND ACTUALLY SUE IT WAS A SAID ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN ILLINOIS THAT SIT ON THIS ISSUE AND I GOT ALL TAKEN CARE OF AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING. SO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF TOTAL DEATHS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY YOU WILL SEE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE. FOR ALL CAUSES TOTAL DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL. I TO WHAT YOU SAY WHAT WE SAY TO EACH OTHER THAT WE REALLY REALLY HAVE A PANDEMIC WHERE THERE'S NO MORE TOTAL DEATHS. IN TWENTY TWENTY THAN THE ONES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AT SEVENTEEN. CLEARLY THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE. CLEARLY THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PROTOCOLS ARE NOT THERE CLEARLY THIS IS NOT STATE. LAW I THINK YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO OPEN UP. THIS PLACE AND ALLOW US TO WALK AROUND AND KNOCK ON DOORS AND DO THE KIND OF LOBBYING THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT. TO DO. I THANK YOU FOR THAT.
