AS WELL AS ADDRESSING AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS- AND A BIG PIECE OF THIS MAKING SURE THAT OUR GREAT IS READY- AS WE TRANSITION OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH AS WE KNOW THE TRACK AS THE PRIMARY DRIVER POLLUTION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- WITH THIS- THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY. AN EFFORT TO REQUIRE- CARB TO SHARE THEIR ELECTRIC FLEET DATA WITH THE STATE'S UTILITIES SO THEY CAN BETTER ANTICIPATE ELECTRICITY GRID DEMANDS AND- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY READY TO MEET THE- THE GOALS OF OUR STATE AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER DEMANDS OF THE PEOPL OF CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND YES I WILL BE TAKING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

AS YOU WELL KNOW THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR REMAINS THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IMPROVING OUR AIR QUALITY AND TO COMBAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS RIGHTLY PUT FOR THIS HISTORIC FUNDING PACKAGES TO ENCOURAGE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION. MY DUTY CARS TO HAVE DUTY TRUCKS THIS LEADERSHIP FROM THE STATE IS HAVING REAL RESULTS AS THE PORTS WAREHOUSES AND OTHER BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY SOCIAL ACTED VEHICLES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GREATEST READY FOR THEM. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL PUTS THE PROBLEM PERFECTLY FOR GOING TO MEET THE GOAL OF A 100% OF ALL MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SOLD BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ZERO EMISSION AND ALSO MEET THE MANY REGULATORY DEADLINE SET UP BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES.

OKAY SPOKE. WITH HIM HE SAID OKAY. COULD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING- THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE DILIGENT HARD WORKING COMMITTEE STAFF WITH WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO CLARIFY THE GOALS THE BILL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE STATE INCLUDING MORE THAN HALF OF SOME UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORIES. ARE NOW CLASSIFIED AS A HIGH. FIRE THREAT DISTRICT. RECOGNITION OF THIS IS WHY I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT MY DISTRICTS LOCAL UTILITY P. GENIES ANNOUNCEMENT LAST YEAR THAT THEY WERE PLANNING TO CONDUCT A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM TO UNDERGROUND APPROXIMATE TEN THOUSAND MILES. OF OVERHEAD DISTRIBUTION POWER LINES IN THE HIGHEST WILDFIRE RISK AREAS BY THE END OF THE DECADE. I'VE SEEN THE POTENTIAL SAFETY IMPACTS OF UNDERGROUNDING IN MY DISTRICT WERE POWER LINES WERE BURIED. FOLLOWING THE DEVASTATING OAKLAND HILLS FIRE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS EXPERIENCE. AND BELIEVE THAT IS IN THE BEST LONG TERM SOLUTION REDUCING THE RISK OF IT- IGNITION IN CERTAIN AREAS LIKE MINE. UNDER CURRENT LAW HOWEVER UTILITIES CAN ONLY SEEK PIECEMEAL INCREMENTAL REGULATORY APPROVAL AS PART OF THEIR THREE YEAR WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN FOR AND PERIODIC GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATIONS. BOTH EXISTING PROCESSES COVER ONLY RELATIVELY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME AND DO NOT PROVIDE THE LONG TERM RISK ASSESSMENT NOR THE CERTAINTY NEEDED FOR PLANNING AND EXECUTION. OF PROGRAMS AS LARGE AS UNDERGROUNDING AT SCALE. AB TWO EIGHT EIGHT NINE WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY TO REVIEW AND COMPARE LONG TERM UNDERGOING PLANS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A WILD WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROGRAMS ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS. IF APPROVED AS THEIR RISK REDUCTION PROGRAM THE BILL WOULD ALLOW. THE PLANS TO STAY IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF THE COVERED PERIOD BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN YEARS. WITH ME TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM. A P. JEANNIE AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK FURTHER ALRP THEMSELF INTRODUCE THANK YOU FOR MEMOREX. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS PATTERSON- ON BEHALF OF P. G. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I WANTED TO HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- CHIEF WHO IS THE CHIEF SAFETY OFFICER AND RISK OFFICER PG&amp;E. WHO CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT I'M INTO THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL- AND REALLY DISCUSS. WHY WE ARE LOOKING FOR A LONGER TERM REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITH RESPECT TO OUR WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM AND SPECIFICALLY UNDERGROUNDING SO. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE ME TO SING. THANK YOU. A RESPECTED CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- THAT YOU'VE GIVEN MYSELF AND P. JEANNIE TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS ABOUT THE BILL. IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR COMMITMENT. TO UNDERGROUND THE HIGHEST RISK DISRIBUTION POWER LINES IN OUR SERVICE AREA. THE ONGOING DROUGHT THE HIGHER TEMPERATURE INCREASED PLANS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IT IS THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NEARLY THREE OUT OF FOUR YEARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DROUGHT YEARS. NOW AS I REFLECT ON. OUR SERVICE AREA ITSELF. BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE THERE WAS AN ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE TO IDENTIFY. HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. FOR SERBIA AND WE HAVE. LESS THAN 15% THAT DOESN'T. I FOR RISKIER WOULD THROUGH THE DROUGHT CAN OF TWENTY TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT SAME DOLLARS WAS DOT EIGHT. MORE THAN. WHICH FIVE ZERO IS IN A FIRE AREAS NEARLY TRIP. IN LESS THAN HALF A DECADE ON THE MARTEL OF TREE BUT THEY- YET THE FUEL FOR THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE SPREAD- AND THE IMPACT OF ALL FAR AS WE ALL KNOW- BECAUSE WE FACED THEM OURSELVES OUR FRIENDS FAMILIES NEIGHBORS. HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS FIRST HAND DEVASTATION THAT COMES WITH NOT JUST AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO HUMAN LIFE AND PROPERTY. NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF LIFE THE NATIONAL RESOURCE FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMIES ACROSS THE STATE. WERE RESPONDING TO THIS CHALLENGE AND MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO MITIGATE RISK WITH THE MULTI FACETED WILDFIRE SAFETY PROGRAM AND ONE COMPONENT OF THAT IS UNDERGROUNDING. AND LAST YEAR WE HAD ANNOUNCED A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM UNDERGROUND TEN THOUSAND MILES OVER HIGHEST RECLINES IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IN THE TEN THOUSAND IS OUT OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. VERSUS SERVICE AREA AND WHAT THE STANDS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AS A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE SHE'LL STOP AND WE WILL NOT REST. UNTIL THAT BECOMES A REALITY OUR NEW UNDERGROUNDING FOCUS AND REPRESENTS THE LARGEST SUCH EFFORT IN THE UNITED STATES TO UNDERGROUND POWER LINES OF THE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION MEASURE. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERGROUNDING DISTRIBUTION POWER LINES IS THE BEST LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR KEEPING CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE SAFE. NOT ONLY DO WE GET THE GREATEST OF THE RISK REDUCTION NEARLY 99% OR MORE OR FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT COULD BE STARTED FROM YOU THE EQUIPMENT. BUT WE ALSO GET ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND REDUCING THE SAFETY RISK WHEN WE DO HAVE TO DE ENERGIZE THE RESULT PUBLIC SAFETY PROPORTIONAL PROBE I'M- FOR THE ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT COST. BUSINESS THIS. ALL WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO REAL. BUT THEN NUMBER AN EX ARE NOW THE NORM BEFORE OF ON FOR TWENTY ONE WE WENT FROM DROP CONDITIONS THE EARLY OF THE YEAR TO DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR IT WILL BE EXPERIENCED THE THIRD SNOWIEST MONTH ON RECORD. DATING BACK TO NINETEEN UNDERSTANDING PROVIDE. FROM ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR CUSTOMERS DURING THOSE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AS WELL. AND THE LAST PIECE OF TOUCH ON IN TERMS OF BENEFIT IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE COSTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS BECAUSE UNDERGROUND THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT. AND ONCE THE LINE IS UNDERGROUND WE WILL USE THE ANY SPENT ON ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK. ABLE TO SPREAD THE COST OF WORK OVER USEFUL LIFE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPREADING THE COST OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND REDUCING THE UP FRONT COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS. ANOTHER BAND SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT WOULD BRING DOWN COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM. WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS EXAMPLES FROM WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN PARADISE FOR THE BUTTE COUNTY REBUILD. BECAUSE OF CONTINUE TO COME DOWN AND UNDERGROUNDING HAS MINIMIZED THE CUSTOMER IMPACT FROM PS PSP PSS AND- A WINTER STORMS. AND CLOSING OUR WILDFIRE SAFETY AND UNDERGROUNDING EFFORTS ARE MAKING A SYSTEM SAFER AND MORE RESILIENT. TO THE STATE'S EVER EVOLVING CLIMATE CHANGES AND CHALLENGES MITIGATING NOT JUST TODAY'S. CLIMATE RISK BUT ALSO TOMORROW'S. AND WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AN AWFUL BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPTION TO PROVIDE COMMENTS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHICH IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. REPRESENTING THE LINE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE PERFORMING THIS EXTREMELY VITAL AND DANGEROUS WORK. SIMPLY PUT WHEN WE- SPENT SO MANY HOURS WORKING IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP SB NINETY ONE DIED AND THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR- WITH. REMEMBER HOLE. AB FIFTY FOUR OR DEVELOP THE WHOLE SORT OF PROCESS FOR FIRE MITIGATION. UP YOU SIMPLY DO NOT BEING AS A PREEMINENT A STRATEGY AS IT HAS BECOME OUT OF NECESSITY- THE CLIMATE CHANGES THAT WE'VE WE'VE EXPERIENCED. HAS CHANGE SO RAPIDLY THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IF THERE'S BROAD CONSENSUS THAT UNDERGROUNDING IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST APPROACH TO PARTNER SYSTEMS UNFORTUNATELY THAT TAKES A CREAM CREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PLANNING- THE WORK FORCE ISSUES ARE CONSIDERABLE I MEAN WE'RE PULLING LINE MEN AND WOMEN AND CONTRACTORS FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES NOT EVEN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES THIS IF YOU LOOK AT IT ALL OF THIS WORK. IS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ROUND IT STAYS IT WILL BE IN THE TOP THREE AS THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BEING UNDERTAKEN THAT TAKES A LOT OF PLANNING. WATCHING THE CURRENT PROCESS DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO THAT AND WE'RE TRYING TO SYNERGIZE. THAT TYPE OF PLAN IT COULD COME THROUGH THE GENERATE CASES WITH- THE- FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. TO MAKE THEM WORK MORE COHESIVELY TOGETHER AND SO WE WOULD TO ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK THANK YOU- WE'RE GOING TO ASK TO SEE IF- ANYONE IT'S GOING TO BE TEN. IN A TO. IS NO ONE. AT ANYONE IN THE ROOM HERE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. OF THE MEASURE OR AGAINST PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION. HELLO BLOOD WITH THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- KEVIN JOHNSON OKAY AFTER THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE APPRECIATE THE BILL ANALYSIS AND BELIEVE IT HIGHLIGHTS MAC OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED IN OPPOSITION EITHER AND SO WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT. ADMITTED TO WERE WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSOR. TO TRYING GET TO SHOW WHERE WE FEEL LIKE. ARE ADEQUATE PROTECT PROTECTED THANK YOU. NINE FORTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIVE MY NAMES CONOR STERN WITH IBEW LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE IN STRONG SUPPORT. YEAH NO FURTHER LINES IN Q. FOUR AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE. SO MANY QUESTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE I COULD SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE FARM BUREAU- I REPRESENT A VERY LARGE. AREA OF AGRICULTURE AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS INCREASES AND THEY ARE CONCERNED AND SO THEY THEY HAVE ISSUE THESE GOT KINDS OF CONCERNS- AND SO I'M GONNA JUST ABSTAINED. R. UNTIL FARM BUREAU MAKES A DECISION THAT MAKES IT VERY CLEAR I HAVE BEEN- TOLD OF THAT- THIS IS- THE FARM BUREAU IN IT WILL. WILL PROBABLY REMOVE THEIR CONCERN. ARE GIVEN A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM- I WILL SAY THIS THAT I DO THINK THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT IT IS MUCH MORE COST EFFICIENT. TO EXPAND PG&amp;E RESOURCES. WITH RESPECT TO UNDERGROUNDING. AND A EVENTUALLY PASSING THAT TO RATE PAYERS. AS A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE. WHICH ACHIEVES SIGNIFICANT SAFETY AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS CUTTING TREES FOREVER. BUT UNTIL THE FARM BUREAU IS SATISFIED- AND THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE MET I'M GOING TO RESERVE- MY VOTE- HOPE FULLY I CAN GET TO AN AYE VOTE AT A LATER TIME. BUT PLEASE WORK THE FARM BUREAU- AND PLEASE WORK WITH AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU READY IT IS FROM MY G. SO- I THINK OF MR PATTERSON AND I AM SURE SOME SOME OF THE CONCERNS HERE GIVEN THAT SOME OF OUR RECENT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TO. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A LOT FOR MEDICATION ON ON RATE PAYERS- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOUR BILL IS PROPOSING AFTER THE AMENDMENTS- THAT I SEE MORE BEING ACCEPTED- SERVICE SO.

I THINK- WHEN THE CHALLENGES I THINK THAT'S BEEN EXPRESSED IN AND NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE FARM BUREAU SAYS BUT BECAUSE I THINK ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE ISSUE OF- RATE INCREASES RIGHT AND- THE- I GUESS REMAINING QUESTION TO BE SEEN IS. HOW ARE WE- MAKE THIS INVESTMENT WITHOUT FURTHER IMPACTING THE RATES RIGHT. AND SO- I GOT A GOOD FEELING FROM YOUR TEAM IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD TO GET TO THIS POINT AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED THAT- WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING. A DIALOGUE BUT- JULIET THINK THAT THE OVERALL CONCERN- WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE IS THE ISSUE OF RATES AND- AND REPAIR SO- THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THEN I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION- FROM THE A MEMBERS OF DICE SURE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT AGAIN YOUR STAFF WORK- AND FOR THE COMMENTS THAT WERE EXPRESSED HER FROM MY COLLEAGUES.

WE WANT TO WORK COLLABORATIVE LEE TO INSURE THAT WERE DOING WE NEED TO DO TO UNDERGROUND ALSO DOING SO IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY MINDFUL OF THE CONSUMER DOLLAR- AND WE KNOW FAMILIES ARE HARD HIT RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY CRITICAL SOMETHING I CARE A LOT ABOUT IT IN A LOT OF CONSUMER.

OKAY SAID THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CALL SEN I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ASSEMBLY BUILT IN NINE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD STABILIZE ELECTRICITY RATE FLUCTUATIONS BY ALLOWING AN ELECTRIC UTILITY TO REQUEST YOU THE AUTHORIZATION TO FINANCE WHILE COMMITTEE EXPENDITURES INCLUDING THEIR OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE. TO SEE IS A LOT. OF PEOPLE YOU. TO SEEK PEACE OUR TO TAKE BY AND TIE THEM TO REPAIR BILLS. OR SECURITIZED BONDS TO PAY FOR JUST AND REASONABLE COST LONGER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASONS ELECTRIC UTILITIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR WILDFIRE WILDFIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS SUCH AS THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO BE RECOVERED BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. WITHOUT THE OPTION OF STRETCHING THE RECOVERY PERIOD WITH FINANCING MECHANISMS LIKE A BOND CONSTANT WILDFIRE MITIGATION CAN LEAD TO MULTIPLE RATE HIKES FOR RATE PAYERS. THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO BOLSTER THE CRITERIA THE PC SHALL UTILIZE WHEN EVALUATING FUTURE WILDFIRE MITIGATION SIX SECURITIZATION REQUEST BY REQUIRING THE CONSIDER THE SHORT TERM RATE STABILITY SECURITIZATION. PROVIDES AS IN THE BEST INTERESTS FOR RATE PAYERS PROVIDED THE PC HAS ALREADY ALLOWED COSTS TO BE AMORTIZED OVER A PERIOD IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MONTHS. BEFORE THE BILL IS PRIORITY MINE AND THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS BILL. I WANT. THIS BILL IS NOT SEEKING TO UNDO ANY PREVIOUS DECISIONS BY THE PC. AGAIN AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN IS SEEKING TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THE PC SHALL UTILIZE WHEN EVALUATING FUTURE SECURITIZATION APPLICATIONS.% HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ADAM SMITH FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND NIKOLINA HERNANDEZ SAID GAS AND ELECTRIC. I THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF. ITS WITH SEVEN EDISON SHARING A STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN S. C.

FOR BRINGING THIS. BILL FORWARD AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED TODAY. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS TO FILE AN APPLICATION. REQUEST THE PEW TI ISSUE A FINAL. ORDER TO AUTHORIZE THE RECOVERY OF WILDFIRE RELATED. TO AN EXPENSE S. C. E. N. ORDER. THREE HUNDRED AND- MILLION DOLLARS IN AND- WHAT. AN INVITATION AND IT'S NOT WHAT. ARE WHAT THE FIRE INVEST MEANT WORK IS NEXT. EVERY IT'S NICE. FIRST TIME SINCE. WE COULD NOT. TO FORTY BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO IN THE FOR. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY PUTS IN PORT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO SMOOTH THIS COSTS OVER TIME. THE LEGISLATURE'S PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SECURITIZATION AS A TOOL FOR SPREADING OUT. THE RATE IMPACT OF OTHER UTILITY WELFARE COSTS SECURITISATION ALLOWS UTILITIES TO ACCESS FUNDS IMMEDIATELY TO START THEIR IMPORTANT WORK THROUGH THE SALE OF BONDS WELL SPREADING OUT THE COST TO. OF THE CHECKS OVER APPROVED SECURITY. HOWEVER EXIST FIVE IT WAS MENTIONED NOT ALLOWED YOU TO CONSIDER THE BENEFITS OF RATE STABILITY WHEN EVALUATING WHETHER TO ALLOW AN ELECTRICAL CORPORATION TO USE THIS OPTION OR NOT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION YOUR COMMITTEE IS DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHTED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS NATURAL GAS COSTS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CENTER THAT ARE LEADING TO RATE INCREASES THAT PERSON RIGHT NOW SECURE IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE. OR NOT AND MAKES THE LITTLE WITH THE PROVED OKAY IF IT DOES. AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN WILL HELP MANAGE SIGNIFICANT RATES BUT THAT'S BECAUSE BY YOU NEED HARDEN THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AGAINST WILDFIRE DELAY ON OUR SHARED. LOS RECENT. DAY THIRTY. THANK YOU DO I NEED MISS AFFAIRS FOR GAS AND ELECTRIC SO IT'S A- WE'RE HERE FOR TO ME PRIOR NUMBER ONE BEING WHILE FOR MANY EFFORTS OF WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S GETTING HOTTER AND DRIER AND OUR WELL FOR MEDICATION INVESTMENTS CAN COMPREHEND AND THESE EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT TO REDO THE RISK THE SECOND PARTY IS TO MITIGATE TERM THANKS- WE- OFTEN THE COMPOUNDING. EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW INCLUDE- DEPENDENT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES THE WERE NEW CRANE- THE ECONOMIC CONTRACTIONS AND THE COST OF EVERYTHING IS GOING UP SO. JUST FOR CONTEXT AT FOR AT. R. O. N. M. COSTS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IS INCREASE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND 40% SINCE THE SB NINE ONE OF THE W. M. P. IN OUR WATER MITIGATION PLAN JUST A TWO YEAR BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THANK THE SAME WERE PUTTING LOT OF PRESSURE ON OUR CUSTOMERS. AND WE ALSO PREDICT THE COST WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE BILLING TO DOLLARS LARGE. OFFER MEDICATION COST EXPENSES INCLUDING- NM. AND TRADITIONALLY- AND M. IS RECOVERED WITHIN THE YEAR THAT THAT'S OCCURRED AND THAT'S QUITE A BETWEEN I THIRTY SEVEN IS SO IMPORTANT. I'M GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR PLANS TO HARDEN DISSEMINATE THESE WERE RE. ALEX AND THE TO TWELVE. OF AND MECHANISMS- A BETWEEN NINE THIRTY SEVEN PROVIDES A GREATER SORTING CLARITY TO BE TO SECURITIZE WILDFIRE ON THEM. WELL MAINTAINED WELL MAINTAINED THE PC'S ABILITY TO DEEM APPLICATIONS JUST AND REASONABLE. LEADING THEBROADER QUESTION IS WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST AND WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ON BALANCING SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS THIS BILL GIVES I'LL USE AND THE PC THE OPPORTUNITY- TO MITIGATE BILL SHOCK. AND ULTIMATELY THAT HELPS CUSTOMERS WOULD BE FILLED THE MOST AND THAT'S IN THEIR POCKETBOOKS AT TO CONCLUDE WE VERY MUCH THINK THE OTHER FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR THE GENEROUS TIME IMPOSING MMS IN. AND WHAT WE'RE EXPECT QUESTOR I'VE THINK. WE. FIVE IN OPPOSITION THEY ARE ON THE PHONE LINE OPEN MODERATE WE PLAY- BUT THAT PER. IN THE QUEUE. THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THIS IS MARK TONY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TURNED THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE TURN STRONGLY OPPOSED THE AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON ISSUE IN THE NEW CREDIT CARD I. THE LEGISLATURE ANYTHING SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE P. P. TO PUT THE BRAKES ON CAIRO RATE INCREASE. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN IS BAD FOR RATE PAYERS BECAUSE SPENDING SECURITIZATION MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PDP TO APPROVE RATE INCREASES TO DATE THAT WILL BURDEN RATEPAYERS BUT I YOUR BILL. FOR YEARS TO COME. HE ALREADY HAS BROUGHT AUTHORITY TO APPROVE SECURE. OF YOUR COP. SO THE PC TO REPLY EXISTING INTO MEASURES TO ADDRESS RATE STABILITY WHAT SPREADING OUT THE COP OVER YEARS. SEARCHING OUT AN ANNUAL CONGRESS SEVERAL YEARS IT'S LIKE USING CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR ITEMS YOU REALLY CAN'T AFFORD IF UTILITY CLAIMS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO WIN SECURITIZATION IT'S BECOMING WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT THE BENEFITS SECURITY COOPER RATE HERE. WENDY THE COFFEE. RAPIER TURNING MATH WITH THE SPOT. ANALOG AND WE DON'T HAVE OPEN OF HUMAN. BONTA HOW YOU PERMITTING UTILITY PROGRESS I. SECURITIZE BECAUSE THE TWIN EIGHTEEN TWAIN WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR EVERYTHING THE PATH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL COSTS. SEVEN CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE PC TO INCREASE GREAT NOT EVEN HERE PLEASE VOTE NO I'M AT TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN YOU TOO DO NOT NEED A NEW CREDIT CARD. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO NOW OPEN IT UP PUBLIC. AND ASK IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF. THIS AUDIENCE I WANT TO COME FORWARD. AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE- PLEASE COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME. SAYING NO ONE COME FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO. ASK IF THERE ARE ANY- INDIVIDUALS ON THE PHONE LINES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN. REFERENCE ONE. THE VENDOR. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU FOR AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN I THANK YOU MASK THE- MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PUT TO MY RIGHT FIRST CUNNINGHAM THAN LEICESTER. YEAH I WAS. SPEAKING CLARIFICATION THE COMMITTEE. ON PAGE SIX. MENTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER AMENDING THIS BILL THE MODIFY THE PRESUMPTION OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND RETAIN THE CONSIDERATION THAT SECURITIZED BONDS MUST REDUCE RATES ARE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THEY'VE BEEN ACCEPTED OR THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACCEPTED. SO THE DEATHS OF OKAY SO THE AMENDED VERSION THE BILL. RETAINS THE CONSIDERATION ABOUT SECURITIZATION REDUCING RATES YES OKAY AT THE ENDING THAT'S IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER AND- I DID ACCEPT ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE QUESTION I WANTED TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE- WITH RESPECT TO THOSE AMENDMENTS AND MAKING SURE I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS- BEING THERE FRESNO FOR EIGHT YEARS WE DID A LOT OF SECURITIZATION WHICH I WAS ABLE TO- YOU KNOW FINANCE- COSTS AT- SIGNIFICANTLY LOW. INTEREST RATES BACK BACK IN NINETY SIX SEVEN EIGHT TWO THOUSAND POINTS OUT SO I. UNDERSTAND THE RISK REWARD FACTOR. OF- SECURITIZATION I WOULD ALSO THOUGH SUGGEST THAT GIVEN THE INFLATIONARY SPIRALS THAT WE ARE SEEING PRESENTLY. AND GIVEN THE CLEAR INDICATION FROM THE FED'S THAT INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP IS IT TAKES THE P. YOU SEE AN AWFUL LONG TIME TO GET ANYTHING DONE. AND THE LONGER THE P. YOU SEE TAKES TO APPROVE THE MORE LIKELY THE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP WHICH CLOSES. THE LEVERAGE. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BASICALLY FREEZE COSTS AT LOW INTEREST RATES. BUT I THINK LOW INTEREST RATES ARE GONNA BE A THING OF THE PAST. PRETTY SOON. SO AGAIN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. BUT I. HAVE REAL CONCERNS THAT THE PC IS SO SLOW. IN MAKING THESE KIND OF DETERMINATIONS. ARE SO I'M GONNA GO FOR IT BUT- I SURE HOPE THAT WE DON'T SEE THIS BY THIS- IN FRESNO WE SECURITIZED- ARE A VERY LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN OUR- BOB. RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND ALL OF THAT TODAY. BECAUSE OF THAT FRESNO HAS ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST AND- SECURE UP. WAYS OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORK WORK FORCE IT IS DOES GET THE BENEFITS AND WE CAN AFFORD THOSE BENEFITS. HOWEVER WE WERE FORTUNATE BECAUSE WE MADE THE SECURITIZATION DECISION. AT A TIME WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE LIKE AT ONE OR 2% ON. A GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS BACK IN THE NINETIES. THE BET WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. IS THE PRICE TAG OF THE SEARCH SECURITIZATION. AND THE SOONER YOU CAN GET IT DONE. THE LESS LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THE INTEREST RATES THAT. CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN AFFORDABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY- I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH RESPECT TO THE PC OF THIS GETS FORWARD IT'S SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PC ACT AND ACT QUICKLY. BECAUSE WE'RE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO SOAR. AND SO NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AT ALL. AND I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT. IF SIX MONTHS A YEAR. TWO YEARS GO BY AND IT TAKES THE P. YOU SEE THAT KIND OF TIME TO ACT. WE COULD SEE INTEREST RATES THAT MAKE THE SECURITIZATION UNAFFORDABLE. AND ONE FINAL COMMENT I WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT CONCERNS. HERE I'D LIKE I'D BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE WHAT NINE YEARS GOING ON TEN YEARS I HAVE WARNED ABOUT TWO THINGS THE GREAT BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNRELIABLE AND THE COST OF ELECTRICITY SPRING AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED RELIABILITY WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT RATES AND YET SESSION AFTER SESSION. WE CREATE IMPEDIMENTS. TO RELIABILITY AND IMPEDIMENTS TO AFFORDABILITY. SO I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IT BETTER BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A WINDOW OF SOMEWHAT LOW INTEREST RATES. BECAUSE PRETTY SOON THOSE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO SORT BY MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I GUESS SUPPORTERS IF THEY WANT TO ANSWER SO THE I THINK THIS IS AN ADDRESS FOR A TWENTY CLARIFICATION WHICH IS IN THE- ABILITIES SECURITIZED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE COST THE STANDARD HERE IS JUST THAT THE P. YOU SEE FIND THAT REASONABLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A SORT OF A LOWER STANDARD THAN IS USUAL FOR SECURITIZATION WHICH I THINK IS AN ESTIMATES COMMITTEE BUT I JUST WANTED CLARIFICATION. EXCEPT HOW IS IT ADDRESSED IT IMMEDIATELY TO WE- WE TOOK THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO AT JUST AND REASONABLE WHICH IS THE USUAL WAY IT'S DRAFTED AGAIN KIND OF FROM USUAL. OKAY YOU SEE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I AM APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO WITH THE SAY IT BEING OF LIGHT MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE WE ARE WE ALL AND I'M SURE THE AUTHOR TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT- SO IF I MAY WITH. CHAIRS PERMISSION I I'D LIKE TO ASK A MISTER TONY TO BE- I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME QUESTIONS FOR MISTER TONY TONY STILL ON. YEP THANK YOU. SO OF MISTER JORDAN TONY I JUST RECEIVED YOUR TURN LETTER AND THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T RAISE CONCERNS. ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMMITTEE THE S. AND AMENDMENT OF THE HAS BEEN TAKEN. TO- TO REQUIRE THAT THAT- THAT SECURITIZED BONDS MUST REDUCE- OUR ROOM RATES PAYER RIGHT. DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN. OUR VISION IS THAT THIS IS THE BILL THAT'S NOT NEEDED P. THREE ALREADY HAVE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE SECURITIZATION THAT THIS BILL MAKES IT EASIER IT IS SENDING A MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT YOU WANT THE P. THREE TO APPROVE MORE WE DO BELIEVE THAT SECURITIZATION DOES HAVE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE I DO THINK BREAK A CAR. AND ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED OVER THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'RE SPENDING FOR IT THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CAR FOR FIFTY YEARS THAT'S WHAT MAKES SENSE TO ASK. SIX YEARS. WE PARTICULARLY AFTER THE I. OF THE EYE OF TAKING IN ANY LOOK A OPERATE AND MAINTENANCE COSTS WHICH OCCURRED SINGLE AND THEN HE THAT OUT OVER FIVE OR TEN THAT WE GET INTO TROUBLE WITH CREDIT CARDS AND WITH SECURITIZATION WHEN YOU TRY TO PICTURE IT ANNUAL CONFERENCE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S WHEN YOU START GETTING THE BILL TO. BUT MR TONY IF THIS BILL IS GOING TO. PROHIBIT THE P. YOU SEE FROM A POOR APPROVING ANY BONDS TO BE APPROVED THAT WOULD RESULT IN A- INCREASE TO RATE PAYERS WOULDN'T THAT SATISFY YOUR OBJECTIVE. IT IT COULD BE FOR A QUESTION OF A INCREASE. OVER THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IT A COMPARISON BETWEEN N. FOR IT DURING THAT FELT THE SAME TWELVE MONTHS AND PAYING FOR IT OVER TIME TO TAKE THE CAR ANALOGY- OF COURSE IF YOU PAY FOR A CAR OVER SHAKESPEARE IT'S GONNA LEFT. HER MIND THEN IF YOU PAY FOR IT ALL AT ONCE EIGHT FOR THE FIRST MONTH OF COURSE BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PAYING. A GREATER AMOUNT IN TOTAL BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST CAR BECAUSE OF THE COST OF FINANCING THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK THAT SIMPLY SAYING IT WILL REDUCE WEIGHT PAYER COSTS FROM WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IS A HIGH ENOUGH THEN. SO THEN I GUESS I WOULD HAVE A QUESTION EITHER FOR THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE I MEAN DOES THIS BILL- WHICH WILL ENSURE YOU KNOW. THAT THAT THE COST IMPOSED ON RATEPAYER OVER A REPAIRS OVER TIME WHAT WOULD NOT BE- INCREASED AS A RESULT OF BEING OF THE SECURITIZE. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE- HE HAD. YEAH FROM THE I MEAN JUST JUST BE SPEAK VERY PLAINLY THE AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK FROM THE COMMITTEE ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGEST THAT IT IT SURE IS THAT THIS IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST ALL THE COSTS ARE STILL JUST AND REASONABLE THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK AND DISCUSSION OF THE PC IS ALWAYS THERE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THE- THE SHIP THAT SHORT TERM RATES MOVING BENEFITS OF OUR THE PROPOSAL HERE. ARE BALANCED IN RELATION TO THE LONG TERM TOTAL COSTS A TO USE MR ANALOGY OF OWNING THE CAR AND ONLY THE SITUATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WOULD FIND THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST WEARING THE SHORT TERM BENEFITS OF MAYBE RATES MOVING IN THE NEAR TERM OR LOCKING AND KIND OF AS VICE CHAIR SUGGESTED KIND COURT COSTS AT A LOW INTEREST RATE. IF THAT BALANCED OUT WITH THE- THE LONG TERM TOTAL COST INCREASES RIGHT OR INTEREST COSTS THERE. THE PC HAS IT WITHIN ITS DISCRETION TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT BALANCE AND EITHER. OR DENY THAT'S THE CORE PIECE HERE I THINK THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK ALL STAYS IN PLACE. THEY HAVE THE DISCRETION AND THAT OF MINUTES WE TOOK FROM COMMITTEE OR WHICH I THINK WERE VERY WELL RECEIVED ON OUR PART WE THINK THIS GOOD. CLARIFICATION JUST TO MAKE SURE IN THE EYES OF THE COMMITTEES VOTING ON THIS TODAY THAT IT IS GOING TO REDUCE RATES AS WITH THE PC. IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF DOING MCCARTY DOES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH I GET I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE LA. RESPONSE TO THAT THE TERM CONCERNS I DO WANT TO EXPLORE. THE NATURE OF FINANCE INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL BE USED. OP WHAT WILL BE THE SOURCE. OF THE REPAYMENT. YEAH IF IT DOES NOT WAS AYE AYE WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET TO HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A- REVENUE BASE BOND AND A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AND IN GOVERNMENT GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS COME AT. FIRST CALL- REVENUE BASE BONDS HAVE A SATISFACTORY STREAM OF- PAYMENT- AND THOUGH THE RATING INSTRUMENTS PROCESS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF A- INSTRUMENT THE UTILITIES WILL USE. TO SECURITIZE IS IT BACK BY RATES OR IS IT BACK BY THEIR GENERAL FUND. I'M HAPPY TO PICK UP THE TICKET YES IT'S BACKED BY RATES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CORE BENEFITS HERE IS THAT WHEN IT'S BACKED BY RATES WE CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THAT CAPITAL THAT THE LARGE SUMS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO KIND OF HELP REDUCE RATES THAT AND PAY OFF SOME THESE WELFARE. EXPENSES AT A LOWER COST THAN IF WE WERE TO TRY TO GO OUT THERE IN THE CORPORATE BOND MARKET AND ACCESS THOSE AND SO THAT SORT OF ONE OF THE CORE OPPORTUNITIES HERE I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTED INTEREST RATES ARE LOW RIGHT NOW BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT INTEREST RATES FOR SECURITIZED WHEN WE WHEN E SECURITIZE ARE ALWAYS LOWER THAN WHAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE USING OUR OWN KIND OF BONDING AUTHORITY THAT WOULD HAVE AS A CORPORATION. BECAUSE OF OUR- FINANCIAL HEALTH BASED UPON THE- BROADER WILDFIRE DISCUSSIONS WITH CONTINUED HAPPENS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE VIEW SECURITIZATIONS OPPORTUNITY IT'S KIND OF ALWAYS GOING TO BE. CHEAPER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THAN JUST GOING ALL STRAIGHT THROUGH BONDS AND STUFF. OUR OWN CORPORATE DOES THAT. SATISFY THE- I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP TO BECAUSE I'M JUST BE. WITH US IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT YOUR EX WILL GET YOU TO GO. AGAIN I THOUGHT. ALL OF THIS MAKES SENSE IF. THE INTEREST RATES PROVIDE A LEVERAGE OF. REPRODUCTION IF THE INTEREST RATES. SPIKE IT CLOSES THAT LEVERAGE. AT AND- AT AND I WILL GO BACK TO THE- RISKS THAT WE TOOK. IN SECURITIZED IN OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WE HAD GOOD ANALYSTS AND WE WENT INTO THAT MARKET AT LIKE I DON'T KNOW 2% SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WERE UNDER A COURT ORDER. TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATION TO OUR RETIREES. SAID SOMETHING LIKE SIX OR SEVEN PERCENT. SO OBVIOUSLY WE LEVERAGED. AND DOWN. SIZE THE COST TODAY. FRESNO HAS- IS HIGHLY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE FEW CITIES. THAT HAS A FULLY FUNDED- RETIREMENT SYSTEM PARTLY AS A RESULT OF. BEING FORTUNATE BEING BEING A BIT PROPHETIC WITH RESPECT WERE PLANNING. BUT ALSO SORT OF LOOKING OUT. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIME LAG IT'S GOING TO TAKE BETWEEN THE TIME WE APPROVE THIS IT GETS SIGNED AND IT'S LAW. TO WIN THE P. YOU SEE WILL ACT AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SITTING HERE SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR FROM NOW SEEING INTEREST RATES SO HIGH THAT YOU CANNOT CLOSE THE GAP. AND THE LEVERAGE IS GONE SO THERE'S A REAL RISK HERE. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE INTEREST RATES ON THE PRICE TAG OF A BORROWED MONEY AND WHO KNOWS WHERE THAT'S GOING TO GO. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS AND HOPE THAT THE P. YOU SEE ACTS QUICKLY AND YOU CAN SECURITIZE AT LOW RATES IF NOT THIS DOESN'T WORK. WE HAVE TO MEMBERS THAT WITH SOCIAL QUESTIONS THAT WAS GÓMEZ REYES FOLLOWED BY MISS GARCIA. THANK YOU. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- FEW CONCERNS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS- AS YOU MAY KNOW I SAID ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE FOR WILDFIRES ALSO WORKED- DILIGENTLY ON SB NINE OH ONE. WITH ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH ALL OF THE I. O. U.'S. SECURITIZATION WAS ALLOWED DISSLY AND IT THE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE SATISFIED ARE LISTED AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THAT THE ARE YOU- YOU HAD TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD OF REASONABLE CONDUCT. THERE WAS SERIOUS QUESTION FOR THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REGARDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE I'LL USE AND THAT WAS A THRESHOLD THAT HAVE TO BE OVERCOME BEFORE WE EVER TALKED ABOUT JUST AND REASONABLE. THAT IS A CONCERN THAT I HAVE REGARDING- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON SECURITISATION BUT I THINK EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO SECURITIZATION. IT'S DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS THE FACT THAT IT ONLY SAID REASONABLE FOR I'M GLAD THE I AM VERY GLAD THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS ACCEPTED BECAUSE THAT WAS A STANDARD THAT WAS PUT IN NINE TO ONE. THE WHEN WE LOOK EVEN IF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS. VERY WELL DONE. AND WE LOOK AT THE EXISTING LAW EXISTING LAW ALLOWS FOR THIS BUT EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES THE STANDARD OF REASONABLE CONDUCT OF THE- I OWE YOU BEFORE THEY CAN EVER GET TO THAT. BECAUSE IF THEIR CONDUCT WAS NOT REASONABLE. FOR THAT PARTICULAR WILDFIRE. THEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THE SECOND STEP OF JUST AND REASONABLE THAT THEN ALLOWS YOU TO GET TO SECURITIZATION. SO I IT'S AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE OFFERED TO. TO WALK ME THROUGH THIS AGAIN- BUT IT IS A CONCERN SO FOR TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT AND BEFORE WE GET ON THE FLOOR I KNOW THAT YOU AND I WILL HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WE WILL. WE CAN DISCUSS IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THANK YOU. THE MEMBERSHIP. YES THANK YOU I HAD BEEN ASKING WHERE THAT TURNED LETTER WAS AND SO FINALLY THAT CA- AND IN SO CAN WE- AND I APOLOGIZE IF I GOT HERE LEAD TO THE SPREAD OF ALREADY BEEN COVER CAN WE- QUICKLY GO OVER THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN AND COMMITTEE. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION THAT I THE PUBLIC PLACE TO. SO WE HAVE BUT THREE PARTICULAR AMENDMENTS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS THE FIRST REMOVED CLIMATE ADAPTATION COSTS EXPENSES CHANGE A CONSIDERATION THAT SECURITIZED BONDS MOMENT MUST REDUCE RATES CLARIFIES THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF SHORT TERM RATE STABILITY WAS ONLY IF THE CPUC AUTHORIZE THOSE COSTS TO BE PAID DOWN UNDER TRADITIONAL MEANS- THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR. OKAY SO F. AS I'M READING THE LETTER FROM TURN A BIG PART OF IT WAS AROUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND THAT'S BEEN REMOVED SO THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED- A PART OF IT- WITH. MAKES SENSE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT RATES ARE GOING TO BE REDUCED TO A WHICH IS I THINK AND- BUT THEN THE MISSION THERE. ARE AND THEN THEY'RE STILL THE PENDING QUESTIONS AND I THINK A LITTLE BIT ALIGNED BUT NOT EXACTLY WHERE- WHAT ARE. MAJORITY LEADER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ALL THAT WORK THAT WAS DONE THROUGH THAT WORKING GROUP THAT CONFERENCE IN. THE BILL THAT WE EVENTUALLY HAD. INSIDE I DO HOPE YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND- COMMON GROUND WITH TURN IT DOWN A LOT OF WORK IN THAT DIRECTION ALREADY AND I WANT TO A KNOWLEDGE. THAT WITH THESE EVENTS AND APART BE EIGHT THAT- I WILL SAY THAT- SHORT TERM REDUCE YOUR RATE SOUNDS GREAT. LONG TERM THE REST WITH THE VERY. WITH INTEREST RATES SHIFTING AN- HOUR THAT MEANS THAT THE SCARE ME SOMETIMES AS THE LAST LOOK AT THESE MECHANICS AND THE RISKS THAT ARE. THAT ARE THERE. AND SOME A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WITH SOME OF THIS SCHEMATICS OF THIS BILL BUT- I AM COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO VOTE FOR IT. AT TODAY. THE ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT RATES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THIS YEAR ALONE WE SEE MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES. AT THE VETS HAVE HAVE BEEN. TALKING TO US AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS IT'S OVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO YOU AFFECTED I THINK A FAIR. FAIR QUESTION THAT WITH THE PATTERSON IS SPRINGING UP- AS WELL AND NO NO WE CAN'T USE THAT THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IS MOOT ANYWAY SINCE- RATES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE LARGE ENOUGH ANYWAY SPENT THINKING. BECAUSE YOU SAID MR PATTERSON'S NAME ME WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING AYE AYES RIGHT LET HIM GOOD QUESTION- I KNOW THAT. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REDUCING RATES. AND REDUCING THE INCREASE OF THE RATES. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS REDUCES RATES. AND NOT MERELY REDUCES THE POTENTIAL INCREASE IN THE RATES YEAH I'M HAPPY TO UP TO BE TOTALLY CANDID I MEAN I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE REDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY RATES. SPREADING OUT THE COST A BIG CHUNK OF COSTS OVER MORE TIME IN YEAR ONE TWO THREE AT CETERA WILL REDUCE RATES. THE THING IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ALL THESE COSTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL COST NECESSARY COSTS WHILE FOR HARDENING IT CETERA THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE RECOVERED. THROUGH CUSTOMERS THAT'S THE REGULATORY COMPACT THAT'S THE TIME WE HAVE. I WOULD SAY THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TO SPREADING IT OUT BE A SECURITIZATION IS AMORTIZATION AND GETTING IT OVER A MUCH SHORTER TIME PERIOD SO IT'S HIGHER SO. I WOULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT BUCKET ACOSTA IF YOU SPREAD IT OUT OVER. THE RATES MOVING THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT'S GOING TO REDUCE RATES FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE EARLY YEARS IT'S JUST LIKE BUYING A CAR IF YOU PAY YOU KNOW FULL PRICE AT THE DOOR IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE ALL UP FRONT. DO YOU THAT DO USE MISTER TONY'S ALLERGY OVER TIME THAT YOU KNOW THE INCREMENTAL IT YOU KNOW PAYMENT EVERY SINGLE YEAR IS MUCH LOWER SO THAT'S THE WAY WE VIEW AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS THANKS. JUST SO MANY RATE PRESSURES COMING ALL AT ONCE CAN SOMEONEPLEASE BE SPREAD OUT OVER TIME. THE PC TERMS WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE RIGHT KIND OF CONSIDERATIONS FROM YOU GUYS THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IT'S- THANK. I'M AGAIN I. WILL I MEAN IF THIS IS ACTUALIZED. WILL THE BASIC KILOWATT HOUR RATE GO DOWN. OR WILL YOU BE YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE- COMMITTING THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. WHAT YEAH WHAT WHAT WE'RE JUST SAYING IS THESE COSTS ARE BIG THE PC EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT RECOVERING THOSE FROM CUSTOMER. WHETHER THE DECISION THAT THIS BILL KIND OF PROMPTS AT RBI'S ACTION AYE OVERTIME WORK ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT I'M HEARING YEAH. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THE COST TO REPAIR YEAH. MY FRIENDS GOING TO BE EX YEAH. AND IF YOU AMORTIZE THEM IT'S GOING TO BE X. MINUS SOMETHING THAT'S CORRECT YEP. I WISH I WISH I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THAT I. LOOK I'VE BEEN HERE NINE YEARS GOING ON TEN YEARS EVERY TIME WE GO AT THESE RATE REDUCTIONS. IT BASICALLY IS WELL IT WOULD HAVE GONE UP THIS MUCH BUT LOOK WHAT WE DID IT ONLY WENT UP THIS MONTH. IT THIS MUCH. AND I CAN TELL YOU. UP CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY BILLS MY OFFICE WAS FLOODED WITH CONCERNS WHAT HAPPENED HERE. RIGHT SO I'M BUT YOU KNOW THAT WITH IN MANY RESPECTS WE ARE MAKING A LEAP OF FAITH HERE. AND WHEN U. S. BUYING AN AUTOMOBILE. YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF OFFERS OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN DO ZERO INTEREST APPOINT NINE NINE. BUT YEAH SOMETHING ELSE THERE 6% 7% CREDIT RATING THAT'S NOT QUITE SO I. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BUT WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS WHERE WE BETTER ACT WITH THE AMORTIZATION NEEDS TO BE A LOW INTEREST RATE. AND IN FACT RATES NEED TO COME DOWN NOT MERELY THE GROWTH OF INTEREST OF RATE INCREASES. COME DOWN. THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S JUST PLAIN WITH SEMANTICS ARE RATE PAYERS NEED RELIEF. THIS BETTER PROVIDE. WHICH MURATSUCHI WELL THANK YOU KNOW WE JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON MISTER PATTERSON'S LINE OF QUESTIONING I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHERE USUALLY GOOD LAWYERS COME INTO PLAY. RATHER THAN JUST RELYING ON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE UTILITIES THAT THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE YOU KNOW SPELLS OUT EXACTLY WHAT WHAT YOU WANT I. ADMIT I HAVEN'T. LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE I'M RELYING ON THE- THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'LL- A LOT AS TO WHAT WE NEED BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE REQUIRES. THAT THAT IT'S A SPELLS OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR MY QUESTION AND EVEN THOUGH WE LOST TO MS REYES MAY HAVE WITNESSED HOLDEN- MR HOLDEN- A YOU KNOW WHO WHO WAS PART OF THE- SB NINE OH ONE DISCUSSIONS THAT THE CAR. COULD NOT BE ARE SECURITIZED. YOU KNOW WITHOUT A SHOWING THAT THE UTILITIES DEMONSTRATE REASONABLE DOUBT SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO. TO IS SECURITIZED COSTS THAT THE THAT THAT WERE INCURRED YOU KNOW THROUGH. BASICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OR NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE UTILITY- AND SO YOU GET SHE SHE IS THE AUTHOR COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING UP WITH MATH OF MS REYES BUT I WANTED TO HEAR THE UTILITIES RESPONSE. TO MS RACES QUESTION. WITH YEAH YEAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO GO- WE WERE RT AND VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE S. B. NINE A ONE MAYBE TEN FIFTY FOUR. AD SUPPORTED THAT CAJUN THANK- THE FORMER CHAIR HOLDEN FOR ALL THIS WORK ON ON THAT WE VIEW THIS THIS LEGISLATION AS NOT TOUCHING THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD AND THE REALLY BALANCED AND YOU KNOW WHAT WELL THOUGHT THROUGH. BALANCE AT THAT. THOSE BILLS BASICALLY TOOK WILL ALL THAT'S ASIDE- THIS JUST IS A BILL THAT FOCUSES ON IF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DETERMINES. THAT THE COSTS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE AND THEREFORE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS IN ITS TOOLBOX THE ABILITY TO NOT LOOK AT JUST SPREADING IT OVER A- YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS. BUT USING THE SECURITIZATION TOOL TO SPREAD IT OUT MUCH LONGER SO WE ARE IN NO WAY ACTIVELY TOUCHING THE REASONABLE STANDARD OR THE DELICATE BALANCE THAT WAS STRUCK IN THE RIBS A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. HAVE MEMBERS INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAISES TIME ON THAT. THAT'S ALL TO THE SIDE WE'RE ACCEPTING THAT AS A GIVEN. THE OUTCOME FROM THE PC PC DETERMINATION NOT. INFORMED IF WE EVEN OPERATE IN THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN SECTION OF THE BILL OR NOT ARCTIC. ANYONE ELSE WANNA. WEIGH IN. TO MY RIGHT LEFT TO CHERISH. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. OTHER AS ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THE SECOND BUSINESS CARE ABOUT. BAUER CAN- LOW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WAS FOR- CLOSING. AND AND THEN ROLL CALL YES- I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL I THINK IT IS VERY HELPFUL AND- YET YES SOME GOOD QUESTIONS.

WHERE IS THAT WAS IT A SCRIPT- THIS WORKERS HI. I TO HEARING FROM NOW OPPOSITION YES PRIMARY OPPOSITION PLEASE VISIT BRANDY BACK WITH PGNIG- I THINK JUST TO START TO SUM IT UP BUT THIS IS WHAT WE VIEW AS A BILL IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AS- THE BILL IS A REDUCTION OF A BILL THAT WAS NEVER HER LAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE AUTHOR BONSER WORST. INSTANCES RELATED TO ANY OF THE WORK THAT'S DISCUSSED IN THIS BILL THAT HAS BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NONE. WE VIEW AS LOCALLY- THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE NEGOTIATING WITH THE FIRE DISTRICTS AND GET FACE TO RESOLVE WE RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES LOCALLY OVER THE FALL WE WERE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THIS BILL EVEN CAME BACK- IF THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN IN THE ANALYSIS THAT ARE UP TO LIMIT THE BILL JUST TWO PRESCRIBED BURNS PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BUT THAT. WAS DECLINED AND THE BILLS NOW TAKE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. SEVERAL YOU'RE A EXPLANATION OF WHY THIS BILL WOULD JUST BE BURDENSOME AND- WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE DIFFERENT FIRE DISTRICTS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY SOME WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS- NOTIFICATIONS OF THE PASSPORT WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE TOSE DATES NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANY OF OUR FIRE DISTRICTS. BUT ALL THE ALL OKAY- BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING HOT WORK FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS WE DO HARD WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE WAY THE BILLS THAT. YOU THAT DEFINITION. IT'S OUR REGULAR ACTIVITIES THAT OUR CREWS DO WITHOUT ANY IGNITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN- WITH REGARD TO PRESCRIBERS WE- DESCRIBE BURN SYSTEM AND- ASSIST JUST IS NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH- AND THEN SIT THERE IS THE STATE OF SAFETY INSTRUCTOR PRODUCTION CREWS. THOSE ARE- AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WHERE WE HAVE TRAINED OUR LEXICAL WORKERS TO BE EVEN MORE PROFICIENT IN FIREFIGHTING. TECHNOLOGY THAT'S WHY THIS IS AT CORE LOCAL LABOR ISSUE- THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE EXPANDER A STATEWIDE MANDATE- WE USE THESE TO RISK AND AGAIN THERE'S BEEN EMISSION ASSOCIATE ARNIE'S CHRIS. WE REALLY JUST. AFTER NO VOTE OR AT LEAST ASK FOR THE BILL BE AMENDED JUST TWO PRESCRIBED BURNS. SOUTH MAKE YOU. TO ME TO GO UP THERE ARE WOULD YOU PREFER SECOND PRIMARY OPPOSITION NEXT PLEASE YEAH. THERE WE GO- GAP INSURE MEMBERS ADAM SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA'S IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVENTY I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PG&amp;E. THE REASONS WE WOULD- NO VOTE ON THIS BILL RECENT ONE WE'RE NOT REALLY CONVINCED THAT THERE IS THE WORK IN QUESTION POSES ANY RISK THE MEDIAN HOUSES. LOOKED AT THE BILL AND YOU KNOW LOOKED AT THE- AND NOT BEEN A CLEAR INSTANCE WHERE THIS HOT WORK. MENTIONED HAS SPARKED UTILITY WILDFIRE. AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE EITHER AT THIS POINT REASON TO WE'RE NOT SURE AND WE ARE HERE TO LOOK AT TODAY AND ACTIONS IT IS. MORE IN THE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ARTIST MIGHT DO WITH THIS WORK BECAUSE IF THE- THE KIND OF WORK WITH- SPARKED UP. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO VALUE WE BRING TO THE FIRE DISTRICTS IN THIS MAYBE GETS TO THE POINT WE HEARD PETER PIGEON ECOG TALK ABOUT IT THIS MIGHT MORE LOCALIZED ISSUE BUT WE'RE JUST NOT AWARE OF IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY HAVEN'T THIS THING. MAYBE TO. GET WORK. SO WE'RE OFFERING NOTIFICATIONS OF WHERE WE'RE DOING WORK THERE'S OFTEN TIMES WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE CREWS TO EMERGENCIES OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE THINK THIS COULD CREATE A LOT OF PAPER TRANSFERRED TO OUR DISTRICTS WE NOT HAVING THESE. SORT OF RECALL. PRESS FOR ARE FACTORED. WERE PRESSURE HEADS WONDERING WHY WE NEED TO KIND OF HAVE THIS BILL TO BE TOTALLY HONEST. WE ALSO THINK PAPER TRANSFER DOES RESULT IN REPAIR COSTS YOU KNOW WE HAVE EMPLOYEES WHO MAY NEED TO BE DOING THESE NOTIFICATIONS POTENTIALLY. NOTIFICATIONS AS WERE CHANGES. BUT WRAP UP I WOULD JUST SAY I MEAN IF THE BILL TOOK THE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IS ABOUT. DATA WOULD NOT. IN OPPOSITION TODAY WILL.

THANKS THE HAVE THE HALF OF THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION THREE FIFTY CONTRA COSTA ACTION IN DEMOCRATS PROVIDES MORE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY TWO ZERO SEVEN ZERO. WE HAVE NO FURTHER LINES IN QUEUE FOR AB TWENTY SEVENTY. I THANK MODERATE WILL BRING THIS- BACK ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS NEVER QUIT YES- COULD BE OPPOSITION COME UP AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SECOND CHAIR. WE USUALLY HAVE MORE ALL RIGHT- SO ARE YOU AWARE OF THE AMENDMENT THAT THE AUTHOR DID TANK. ON IN THIS AREA THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. WITH RELATION TO GOD SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE ONE IN THE ANALYSIS BUT YOU DID TAKEN AMENDMENT ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT. WE ARE AWARE OF THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD PRO. MR FROM US FOR THE LAST RIDERSHIP DATA. BUT IT WOULD STILL WORK US TO GO THROUGH. A SERIES OF MEDICATION TO ALL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE FAR DISTRICTS FOR OUR VERY VERY REGULAR HOTWORK AND HOPE FOR SINCE MOST FIRE DISTRICTS ISSUE SAID. CARE I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU IN THE AUTHOR COULD AGREE ON IF THE FIRE DISTRICT WANTS TO BE NOTIFIED. THAT BOB SHE WILL FIVE THEM BUT ONLY IF THEY ASK FOR IT. JUST SUGGESTING THAT DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO SEE YES OR NO. BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT WORK THINGS OUT. WE'LL SEE. YEAH I MEAN WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT THAT'S BEEN OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT ANY FIRE DISTRICT IS WELCOME TO DISCUSS ANY ISSUES WITH US RELATED COMMUNICATION OR CAREERS WHICH TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ONLY TO SERVE OUR AUTHORS DISTRICT. BROUGHT BURKE AND PAT THIS IS A FOR LATER THIS WEEK ON BOTH ORDER SAYS AND NONE OF OTHER. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE PART OF ASSETS SO THAT'S THE POINT THE POINT IS IF SHE LIMITED THE BILL IN THAT WAY AND AGAIN NOT ASKING FOR YES OR NOT. FROM THE TIME. THAT WORKS. YOU'RE GOING. I MEAN IF THE DISTRICT REALLY WANTED GONNA TELL. FOR AND- JUST SAY. SO I THINK SOMETHING CAN BE WORKED OUT OF THE VOTING NIGHT TODAY AND ON THIS BILL MOVED YET. NOT YET WE STILL HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR MOVE IT SOME OF IT. IS OUR SECOND. RESPECT SECOND OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS. HOLDEN JUST A COMMA- THE SAID NEXT YEAR I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FORGOT ABOUT IT- WHOSE- SO I HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL ALREADY- I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AMENDMENTS THAT ARE STILL THAT ARE THAT YOU'RE ON AND THEN PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE MIGHTY OFF FROM THERE. RESERVE MY THOUGHTS- BUT- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE MADE SOME CONCESSIONS SINCE LAST YEAR PLEASE. DO SO THE AUTHOR MS BARAKAT INDICATED THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A PHONE CALL OR AN EMAIL ME WHY NOT HAVE TWO HUNDRED WHATEVER FIRE DISTRICTS EMAILS. JUST STOP NOTICE WE'RE DOING FIREWORK ON THIS DAY OR THERE'S ALSO A FIVE DOLLARS CIVIL FINE FOR EVERY FAILURE IS NOT AN IT FOR A TYPE OF. WORK THAT THIS NOT BE APPROPRIATE. I DON'T KNOW IF. GET PAID LIKE DETERMINE AS WELL. HOW HOW FREQUENTLY IS JUST TYPE OF HOT WORK DONE THE THAT THE IS WRITTEN IN THE- IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHY THAT SPECIFIC DEFINITION EVEN CREATES FIRE RISK ALL IT SPEAKS TO IS WORK DONE WITH ANY TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT MIGHT CREATE A SPARK ON LINES THAT WERE WORKING ON OVER FIFTEEN VOTE. PUT IN THERE BY DIFFERENT OF SO IT'S WE TO BASICALLY COME UP WITH A NEW PROTOCOL TO USE A NEW DEFINITION OF WE DON'T CURRENTLY EMPLOYED THERE ARE SPECIFIC HOT WORK. RECALL THAT WE DEAL WITH WITH L. AS THOUGH IT'S A DIFFERENT THAT IN THE NOTES SEPT. GET IT AB. COME A NOTIFICATION BAR. FOR EVERY STEP AND- YOU WE MIGHT DOING CON DIFFERENT CIRCUITS COVER MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PARTITIONS IN A SINGLE DAY SO- WE- BECAUSE HAVE TO REARRANGE OUR CREWS WHEN WE HAD A LOT OF THE- STORM OUTAGES IN JANUARY. A LOT OF OUR PLANNED WORK WAS THAT SUDDENLY- CHANGED AND WE'RE GETTING QUESTIONS FROM A LOT MEMBERS ABOUT WHEN CERTAIN. WORKERS SIR NEIGHBORHOODS SO THERE'S LOT TO GO INTO COORDINATOR OUR ASSETS AND ANY ADDITIONAL PAIRS OF THAT DO YOU JUST INCREASE OUR- COSTS TO COMPLY TEACHER. THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR UGH- THE SAID THE CANADIAN ELSE'S DOES SAY THAT THERE IS NO DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF FIREWORK HOT WORK THE CAUSING A- FIRE. BY NASSER THIRTY REST A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP THAT I'M NOT AN OPPORTUNITY DRESS WHICH IS- THANK YOU MISTER BURKE FOR. I'M AT ONE OF THE REASONS DOING THIS BILL IS ANY CLAIMS OF THE EASY FOR HER TO HOLD ON I WANNA BE A 100% CLEAR THEY SUED. THESE DISTRICTS WENT TO COURT AND MY FIRE CHIEF WHOSE JOB IS TO KEEP MY COMMUNITY SAFE WITH SPENDING HIS TIME LITIGATING THIS. SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE FOR EVERYONE OF THESE FIRE DISTRICTS IN HIGH FIRE ZONE TO GO TO COURT AND YOU NEED TO GET NOTICES WERE BE NOT BIG NOTICE I WENT TO COURT IT I'M SECONDLY I WOULD SAY THE HOT WORKED UP IT'S TO THEN USE NINE TIMES AND CODE IT'S STANDARD. IF PG&amp;E WANTS TO TALK TO US OR AT OUR CENTER THE OTHER I USE I SHOULD SAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA SITTING RIGHT CAMP I. HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT THAT ISN'T RECESSION THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO KILL THE BILL- REQUEST AND I ASK MY FIRED ON THIS IS A CRITICAL BECAUSE I KNOW THE AND THAT IS WHY THEY STARTED THIS EFFORT IS BIG THEY SEE THE IS IT. WHY NOT. THIS IS LIMITED TO HIGH FIRE ZONES. SO THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE URBAN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WERE IF THE SPARK FLIES ON A WINDY DAY WE HAVE A REAL REAL. CONCERN AT CHIEF MEYER. UNITS RESPOND TO THE MEMBER'S QUESTION. YET YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT IF HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS KEEP IN MIND. DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT WE NEED TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE THING THEY DID THEY'RE DOING THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE. THAT'S NOT TRUE THE BILL NOT NOT SHOULD WITHOUT WILL BE SPARKED INTO BEEN INVESTING. THAT I HIGH LEVEL. SO I WOULD LIKE. THE IRONY THAT I FONG. IT COMMERCENTRE ABOUT A WOULD BE. NOTICE YEAH. ONCE I FIND IT ALSO KIND OF TO GIVE TO REDUCE. YEP MAY HAVE A CITY CODE OF THE TO THE FIGHTS. THE BILL'S LEAD ON. LET'S CUT THEM IF IT'S NOT AN ISSUE WHY AM I BEING TOO. BY JURORS FIRE ENGINES ARE GOING TO BE A LOT. WITH DANGEROUS WORK. I'M NOT A KNOW IF THERE IF THEY WANT PUT THEIR MY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS AND WHETHER THE MOVE DOES THOSE AFTER. YEAH ABSENT HARD WORK WINDOWS HIGH FIRE RATE AREAS. THE IS NO DOCUMENTED. THEN WHY ARE THEY THERE THAT LIKE A PROP SO TO PUT COMMITTEES I GONNA GO WITH WHAT THE ACTUAL VOTER ID SPEAKS THAN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THANK YOU. I'M MISTER IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING. CAME TO THE MICROPHONE. MEMBER CAREER THEN M. THEN MEMBER MAY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CAL CODE IF YOU EMPLOY IN PLAN SPEAKING ON BILL TODAY. WE HAVE NOT TAKEN OF POSITION BUT WANT TO A LITTLE. POLICE FIFTEEN THOUSAND. A DAY. DOING HOT WORK WE DON'T DE ENERGIZED LINES. VERY RARELY DO WE DE ENERGIZED LINES THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY. ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. I CAN'T IMAGINE IT IF THE UTILITIES ARE CALLING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE AN ENGINE CREW AT THE READY TO GO AND RESPOND. OUR CREWS ARE TWO TO THREE MEMBER CREWS. EVERY MEMBER CARRIES A MIRACULOUS DEVICE IT'S CALLED SOFA. AND IF A FIRE WERE TO BE SPARKED THEY WOULD CALL NINE ONE ONE. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO BE ANY SLOWER THAN IF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE WHAT'S CALLED A DAY OR TWO EARLIER. SEVEN MEMBER CARILLO OKAY. AND THEN- MEMBER MAYES AND THEN- MEMORIES. I JUST I'M JUST SORT OF OTHER ACTUALLY PROVIDED SOME- SOME HELP TO ALL THIS BECAUSE ON ITS FACE PROVIDING AN EMAIL OR TRANSPARENCY SEEMS LIKE IT'S NO NO BIG DEAL- ALSO THE FACT THERE'S SUCH CONSTERNATION BY. THE CHILI'S ALSO A LITTLE ODD TO ME SO I'M TRYING TO REALLY FIGURE IT OUT I'VE BEEN- GAL TO THE FORMER MANY HERE A LITTLE BETTER IT IS OLD. HERE HE IS THAT HE- BE. ARE POSSIBLE THIS BILL. AND I. GUESS GOOD REASON. WHY MAYBE IT'S THE COMMENTS THAT THAT MR WHY HAD JUST SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO- TALKING OR- A PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I'M A GIVE TIME THREE. THE TIME FRANKLY TRIED FIGURE THIS THIS THIS BILL THIS BILL OUT BECAUSE AGAIN ON ITS FACE IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT BIG OF A DEAL AND IT AT THE SAME TIME- IT DOES LIKE YOU COULD ACTUALLY CREATE. A MORE MORE FARM AS WELL- I'M- JUST STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT LESS MATT. THIS RESTAURANT RESEARCHERS YES. YES. THROUGH THE CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD LAST YEAR- ON THIS BILL WITH THIS WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED AND TOO DIFFICULT AND I'M I SORT OF TRY TO WRAP MY HEAD THE SAME WAY YOU DO BECAUSE HIS CREW. STRETCHES AS THEM IS TELLING THEIR CURSE WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MECHANISM IS I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER I DID ASK THAT QUESTION- IT. PART OF HER. AGAIN SEEM. A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO ME IN EVERY SITUATION WITH THE FIRE CHIEF SENT A FIRE CREW MADE WE COULD LET THE FIRE CHIEF SANTA THAT BUT MY GUESS IS NO BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT WHEN. BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO LOCATE WHERE THE WORK IS BEING DONE IS SIGNIFICANT IT'S REMOTE OFTEN IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT YOU HAVE. HARD EVACUATION ROUTES IN SOME OF THESE WHERE I LIVE. ONE WORD IN ONE ROW OUT. CHIEF WINOKUR. I HEARD ALL GETTING OUT TO. MEDIA WINDY TODAY THANK FIRE STAND THIS WORK IS BEING DONE AND THE COMMUNITY IS ALL AT HOME AT THAT TIME WHAT HE SAID OF OUR GROUP PROBABLY RIGHT SO DEPEND THEY MAKE THAT JIM BUT IN THE INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS. WE WHEN WE SEEN IN THE- IT. OUT ALL UTILITY. WILDFIRES THERE WHEN FIRE CREWS CAN THEIR TO FASHION IT HAPPEN MY DISTRICT MANY TIME WE CAN GO A HELOC. ON A GROUNDER CHRONIC. THEY CAN STOP THE HERE'S EIGHT. THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT IF I IF I CAN'T. MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS THAT SORT OF CAME TO MY MIND IS IF YOU DO PROVIDE THESE NOTICES THAT THERE'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE FIRED UP. IS GONNA GET GET THE- EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEN IT BECOMES NO BIG DEAL TO THEM THAT'S GOING TO BE EVERY SINGLE DAY. EIGHT SO THE TEN CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE THAT ARE THERE AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING I'M SORT OF MAYBE MISSING AS WELL IS THAT IF THERE ISN'T ANY PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF A STAR AT THE- STOP BY PER SOME SOME NOTICE MAKES IN A WAY. MAYBE THAT THERE IS IN SEARCH OF A TRYING TO SOLVE SOMETHING MAYBE ISN'T YET UP BUT YET A PROBLEM I'M SO CAN YOU PROVIDE THAT INSTANCE OF AND- I. A LINE THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING THESE THE TWO CHIEFS HEARD FROM SO I THINK THEY'RE GONNA YOUR ABOUT THE NUMBER GET IT TOO MANY SORT IN WHICH ONE TO DRESS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO PASS THAT THE AS WELL. YOU SHOULD. NUMBER THAT WILL BE A TO RECEIVE AND PROCESS I'LL TELL YOU I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE INFORMATION REGARDING HIGH RISK GROUP THE POINT OF RESOURCES IN MY DISTRICT THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM WE CAN SOLVE BORN TURN. IF THAT THAT. THE TRIGGER THAT REQUIRE NOTIFICATION ARE NOT NEARLY AS MANY HITS AS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY CITED IN THAT TESTIMONY TODAY. THE BILL NUMBER AND ALLOWS US. SOME PICTURE OF WHAT BY RESTRICTIVE VISA DURING WITHIN OUR DISTRICT AND ALLOWS US TO UTILIZE THAT AS PART OF THE PLANNING CONSIDERATION THEY GO INTO THE POT OUR RESOURCES ON THE BASIS SO IT THE IN. NORTH MUCH INFORMATION AND THEN SURPRISED LEARN THE THESE THINGS ARE AND ONLY THE WORK BECAUSE OF THE COMMISSION. THE PRESENCE OF FIREFIGHTING REESE. THIS SO CAN UNIPER OF OUR FIGHT DISTRICT APART UNIT OR ON. DISCOVERED THAT MOST OF THE OTHER FIRE FOR YOU. FROM UP. THE PROVIDER ALREADY THERE THAT DELAY HERE FOR BUT EVERY TO SAYS CA. THAT IN. THE ANSWER IN THE DYNAMIC. ARE THE- THIRTEEN FIREFIGHTER RESPONSE. AND SHARING THE INFORMATION. HELPS US FORM A COMMON OPERATING PICTURE ARE RAPIDLY LEADS A MORE EFFICIENT. PUBLIC TO RESOURCES ALLOWS US TO STOP FIRE BOOTH SPREAD UNDER ANY CAN ASSIST YOU FURTHER A AND THEN IS TO YOUR ALREADY GETTING THESE NO A- THEN. YOU'RE ALREADY RIGHT IN THE ORDINANCE. CORRECT BY ORDINANCE THE MACARENA FIRE DISTRICT REQUIRES NOTIFICATION FOR SIPG TEAM DEPLOYMENTS- AND THE HARD WORK THAT REQUIRES SIPG DEPLOYMENT- WE WERE SUED HAVING PASSED THAT ORDINANCE WITH P. GENIE WITHDREW. OF THIS RACE AND. INITIALLY WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT MY CONCERN DO WITH DUPLICATE NOTICES. BUT I AM ALSO A QUANDARY LIKE- MY COLLEAGUE. IT SEEMS THEM AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SHOULD IT. MOVE FORWARD IS DEFINING THE NON EMERGENCY HOT WORK SO THAT IT ISN'T OWNERS SO THAT IT THERE ARE. THERE IS A DEFINITION OF WHAT IT WILL. REQUIRE THEM TO NOTICE TO GO TO THE FIRE CHIEFS OR TO THE FIRE FIRE DISTRICTS OF THE FACT THAT IT'S JUST FOR A HARD FOUGHT BUT AREAS ALSO IS GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF. SIX THAT ARE BEING DONE. REQUIRE THE NOTICE. OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE FIRE DISTRICTS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT REFERS TO. ALL OF CALIFORNIA OR JUST THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. THAT SPECIFIC TO OUR SERVICE TERRITORY WITHOUT HIGH FIREFIGHTERS AT ALL I THINK. OF WHICH I'M NOT SURE I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT OVERLAP WE HAVE AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE OVER THREE THOUSAND MILES OF TRANSMISSION LINES IN HIGH FIRE AFFAIRS WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF. DISTRIBUTION LINES HIGH FURTHER TERRITORIES. THIS BILL JUST SAYS FIVE OUR THIRD DISTRICT DOESN'T SAVE TIMES OF THE YEAR OR BY SHE'S THIS THE- BEST DIFFERENT THAT BORDER. WHETHER BACK TO THE LOCAL ORDINANCE WE SEE BECAUSE- THE OFFICE SAID THAT WE HAD TO PAY FIRED FOR THE CALL TO DEPLOY OUR TROOPS. ARE LARGER CIRCLE. MAY IT WAS IT'S BEEN SAID THAT WE HAVE FOR TRUCKS AROUND WE DON'T. ACCEPT DO NOT GOING FAR TRUCKS THERE. A WORKER THAT HAVE FIRE FIVE SKILLS. AND IF A FIVE IGNITES WE ARE REQUIRED. TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. SO THEY WILL BE NOTIFIED IN THAT INSTANCE WE HAVE VERY CLEAR REQUIREMENTS ABOUT OUR USE OF THESE. CREWS IN OUR WATER MITIGATION PLAN IT COVERS OVER TWENTY PAGES I BELIEVE ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE AND WHY WE USE THESE CRITTERS. THERE'S TO. TWENTY PERSON CREWS CURRENTLY THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE TRAINED TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. AGAIN IT'S TO REDUCE RISK IT'S- IN OUR WITH. OUR WATER MITIGATION PLANS COVER OVER I BELIEVE SEVEN HOT. WHAT WE ARE. THIS WORK IS WITHOUT INSTANCES OF- FIRES BEING IGNITED IT SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE TO REGULATE OUR USE OF THESE CAREERS THAT ARE THERE TO REDUCE RISK INTO LOWER VEGETATION AND TO. CUT OUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIRES I COULD SPEAK AGAIN WOULD NOT REALLY CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IT. I THINK I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. DR QUIRK. THAT IF. A FIRE DISTRICT SAYS GIVE US THE NOTICE THEM TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GIVE THEM THE NOTICE THAT ISN'T WITH THE BILL SAYS BUT- THE END OF. IF YOUR DISTRICT WANT IT AND IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET IT THEN MAYBE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT- THE FIRE DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THROUGH LIVE. TO WITH THE FIRE JUST DOESN'T WANT IT THEN CLEARLY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE IT. BUT IT TO GIVE THAT OPTION TO THE FIRE DISTRICT IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE I AM GOING TO GIVE A COURTESY- I VOTE. AND SEE HOW HOW THIS. PROCEEDS TO FIGURE OUT IF INDEED IT IS. A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE FIRE CHIEF MAKES. A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THIS BECAUSE IT IS A LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WITH THE WILD FIRES WE HAD. THE LAST THING WE WANT IS TO CUT CORNERS AND NOT TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING THAT POTENTIALLY COULD CAUSE SERIOUS. PROBLEMS AND LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO I HAVE A QUESTION AND THEN PROBABLY ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THE ON THE CIVIL PENALTY PIECE. IS THE PENALTY ASSESSED THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE WRECKED QUIZ THAT NOTICE IS IT A PER OCCURRENCE TYPE PENALTY. THE EXACT CORRECT YES FOR EVERY NOTED FAILURE TO NOTIFY OKAY SO BENEFIT ON THAT BECAUSE- IT SEEMS LIKE. ANOTHER WAY TO GET UP ON A TRENARY RAGE FILLED BUT I MEAN ANOTHER WAY TO GO WOULD BE YOU KNOW THERE'S A CIVIL PENALTY THE NOTE REQUIRED CONSENT AND THEIR SON DEMONSTRABLE HARM THE RESULTS AND THEN THE PENALTY MAYBE IS HIGHER. BUT THE MY CONCERN PANEL THING THE- S. THE LACK VIæT NOTICED THE BOARD- THE INCENTIVE FOR THE UTILITIES IS JUST TO JUST BE BLANKETING EVERYBODY IN ASSISTIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES POINT AND- ALSO THE- ADDRESSES POINT I MEAN THERE'S SORT OF THIS INCENTIVE CREATED UNDER THIS BILL TO. BE COVERING YOUR REAR. THIS IS CONSTANTLY AND THEN I WONDER WHAT. THE YOU KNOW IS THERE A DAY LUCIA FACT I MEAN IT'S BUT ARE THEY JUST GOING TO BE. FILED WHEN PEOPLE GET THEM WHEN MAY IT MAYBE IT COULD BE NARROWED SO THAT. THERE'S LIABILITY THAT'S MAYBE HIGHER BUT I'M SURE THE UTILITIES WOULD LOVE THAT YEAH BUT THE IF THERE THEY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE NOTICE UNDER CERTAIN SAID PRESCRIBED CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY DIDN'T AND THERE'S SOME HARM THAT RESULTS FROM THAT NOTICE ON JUST. WONDER THAT IT SEEMS LIKE A- ME BECAUSE I. HAD TO DO THE BILL HYATT IN BUT I AM ALSO HE- THAT THE UTILITY WORKERS ARE. IN THE TWO BE SAYING. WE HAVE AN REALLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS BEFORE SO- I I'M JUST OPENING UP TO ANY COMMENTS FROM SUPPORT OPPOSITION IN RESPONSE TO. MY RAMBLING IT WAS A RANDOMLY THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM- I'LL START WITH JUST POINTING OUT TO EVERYBODY HERE THAT BOTH THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA MARCH DECISION AND THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SO I THINK THERE DISTRICTS OUT THERE THE WANTED I'M EVERY BIT I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M OPEN TO A BOTH. S. AT WHICH- IN THE- ADDITION TO THE TOP COST THESE DISTRICTS TO GET THERE I'M FOR THIS NOTICE OF DISTRICT DOESN'T WANT IT YOU'RE RIGHT I DON'T SEE THEY WOULDN'T USE IT LIKELY RIGHT SO WHAT'S THE POINT SOME ABSOLUTE OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION IN GETTING THEIR FOR- THAT PIECE OF IT BUT- AND I DO WANT TO GO TO CHIEF MEYER ON THE RISK BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REAL- BUT I DO WANT TO JUST POINT OUT MISTER CUNNINGHAM THAT AYE. I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL WE DON'T ALWAYS WAIT UNTIL WE'VE LOST HOMES AND LIVES TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THESE FIRE CHIEFS ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR TO SET A TRIAL TO SEE A COMMUTE FRONT END RIGHT AND IF YOU DO THAT LET DO THAT LET'S THIS NOTICE. YEAH IS IT. SOUNDS LIKE FROM THE CHIEFS. BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE TWO ARE. AND THAT ARE GOING CITIZENS. ONEROUS IT IS NOT A LOT OF NOTED. THAT DOES NOT QUANTIFY THE WAY WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION- BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING ON THE FRONT TO PREVENT THESE FIRES. I DO THINK THAT IS A CRITICAL STEP THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE TAKING BUT I'M- A LAST YOU'VE MEYER HE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING ON THE RISK RETURN TO PREVENT. BUT YET. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER THE ONLY THING. THE ONLY. COUPLE OF NUMBER ONE- HAVE THAT FIRE STARTED. IN EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- FROM HOT WORK. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT. AFTER THE FACT BY A CITIZEN WITH AN EXPLOSION. IN A TRANSFORMER. SO IT DOES HAPPEN. SO THIS IDEA THAT IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. IT'S JUST THAT I THINK THAT THE- NO- COMMITTEE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE. AND HE ALSO SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. YEAH THEY DO HAVE THE STATE. WHICH ARE. I TOLD HIM SETTING THE THEIR JOB. YOU KNOW BETTER. YOU KNOW MY- ELECTRICITY STE WHICH I HAVE A KIND OF START FOR. THAT'S NOT WHAT SAYING. WHAT WE SEE DID THIS. TYPE OF THE- TYPES ENGINES THAT WE USE ON OUR STAY FIRED. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY TYPE OF TYPE CIKK THE HI THE NUMBER STATE OF THE CIRCLE. AND THEY HAVE SAME THING WE UTILIZE IN ITS SINCE. THE FIRE IN THEY'RE NOT IT MAY BE ONE OF THEM INTO BUT THEY'RE NOT TO TRUCK THE- IS WHAT DIDN'T AND IT HAS. IT OUR IN OUR AREA AND I AND I DO UNDER. HE. BUT I WANT TO BE THE STOCK. THE FACT THAT. IT'S. HAPPEN I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO SAY INCLUDING THE VICTIMS HAVE NOT BEEN ORDERED THAT ALL. KIND OF FACT. GET NOTIFIED BECAUSE IT IS ONLY IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IT'S NOT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. EVERYTHING THEY DO WE ONLY NEED TO. IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS AND IT IS V. AT BEST- AND I GOOD MY COLLEAGUES MEDICAL ON THAT SO I'M- BUT CAN NOT SAYING IT AND I HAVE MORE THAN A SO I'M COMPETITION THERE SO- I'M NOT WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THAT CHANGE SOMETHING IN NO LONGER USE BUT FAULT OF INTO THE FOR THAT JUST BOUGHT WITHIN THE LAST YEAR WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. HIRING PEOPLE THE HIGHLY. AND HIGHLY TRAINED TO. ON AND FIRE MITIGATION. AND I'M NOT SPENT SOME SO THAT MIGHT COME THANK. IF WITH CHAIRS AND SO SOME OTHER. WAS IT. OKAY SO PROVIDING THE NOTICE AND A HIGH RATE OF HIGH FIRE AREA. PROVIDE SOME PREVENTIVE BECAUSE I THINK ALL ANGRY WITH YOU WOULD RATHER NOT START FIRES AND CLEAN UP THE MESS AFTERWARDS- YOUR WHAT WHAT. HOW DOES THAT'LL ALLOW THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT INFORMATION LIKE ARE THEY THEY PUT TRUCKS AT THE READY OR DO THEY LIKE REAL PEOPLE OUT STAND AROUND WATCHING WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THEIR UTILITY WORK IN THE IF YOU KNOW SECOND HOSE OFF ANY SPARKS- A- I UNDERSTAND. WHO IS- WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THE ISSUE RAISED ABOUT CONFLICTING ORDINANCES WITH THIS POTENTIAL LAW BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IRONED OUT IS THAT IS THIS LAW DOES IT OVERRIDE ANY ORDINANCES ARE THEY REQUIRED TO GIVE IT ONE ANSWER HOW MANY ARE DISTRICT IS OF AN INCIDENT BECAUSE THE SLOPE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT THE CLEANEST MOST STREAMLINED THING POSSIBLE ISSUES RIGHT THROUGH IT HER DROPS. WHERE WERE YOU JUST YOU DO WITHIN. THAT WOULD BE FOR HERE FROM YOU. YES I AGREE THAT HAVE AND I'LL GIVE GUYS KIND OF MY SOMEBODY EARLIER I HAVE THE WAY SIDE OF MY DISTRICT LEADER GILLES NOT THE SAME LEVEL OR OR SCOPE OF. THE OPEN HELD BUT- LIMITED ACCESS IN LIMITED THAT. AND THE FIRE A AND THAT MIX WITH GOT MY COULD BEEN IF I DIDN'T KNOW TO PUT EIGHT EIGHT WORK OUR A HOT WILL BE DONE DURING OUR WILD SEE THEN WE KNOW SEND THE OUT JUST LOOK AT THE AREA NOT TO NOT. WHAT THE BILL IS DOING BUT THIS WHAT THE- ARE WORTHY OF SPACE ARE GIVEN I CALLED SITUATION AWARENESS KIND OF THE NUMBER ONE WORLD BY. KNOWING WHAT TOP BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN PICK UP A SELF AND CALL I GOT BUT WHEN WE GET A CELL PHONE CALL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS WE HAVE NO BIG ROLE WE HAVE THE- THOUGHT PROCESS YEP GO BACK AND- SO. NO GLOBAL ARE. CONCERNS UP WAY RIGHT YOU HEAR THE BALL TO THE- I'M DOING A QUICK QUICK LOOK AT THE WORK BEING DONE AWAY BEING DONE AS SAY NOTHING WHAT THE WEIRD THING. AND THEN WHEN THE CALL COMES IN WE'LL LET YOU GO. THEY HAVE TAKEN A CELL PHONE CALL. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT CRIMINAL THE OTHER END. BUT ANY IDEA WHAT THE BILL. THAT'S ISSUE RIGHT. SO THAT'S ABOUT THE LEVEL. OF TWO. AWARENESS NO OUR DISTRICT. YEAH HE THOUGHT WITH SOMETHING WAS DAYS ENOUGH. TO BE ABLE TO DO GO OUT. TO PUT ME IN THE CAN. IN A CERTAIN AREA THAT MIGHT MAKE A BIT SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY THE BILL ISSUES. FROM ALL ACROSS. WE DO IT ALL TIME NO. LORD JURISDICTION. HAS PRESCRIBED BY CPC. PEOPLE PUT FORTH THE BILL WOULD WORK CALL ONE COURTNEY AND COOPERATIVE WITH THEIR FIVE DISTRICTS WITH LOCAL CHURCH. HAVE THE ABILITY THAT THE WAITED IT WE WILL WORK WITH WITH THE THIS WORK AND IT SHOULD BE GET NOTICE. M. WHAT THAT NOTED AND WHAT THEY HAVE CURRENTLY IN AND YOU DON'T IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK. NINETEEN SECOND QUESTION AND WHICH MANY AND AT WE THIS TO BE A STRONG BY. WHICH TO MAKE YOU KNOW I AGAIN WANT TO RETURN MY GRAD TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK SOME THEIR ROOM DINNER STATION IN I THINK MAY A LOT OF SAN WE'RE TRY TO MAKE THIS. IF THERE IS K. WILL. RIGHT THAT BUT- IF. YEAH I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WITH ACCIDENTAL THAT THERE IS A TRANSFORMER THAT EXPLODED I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT EXPLODING TRANSFORMERS NOT HARD WORK WE PROVIDED DATA TO THE COMMITTEE THAT. OUR TECHNICIANS ARE RELATED TO PREFECTURE OR BADGE MANAGE VEGETATION OR ANIMALS COMING INTO CONTACT LINE IT'S NOT HARD WORK SO TO BE CLEAR AGAIN IF WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK ON ANY STREAMLINED PROCESS TO SEE IF THERE IS A- SPECIFIC ISSUE REYES AND WITH REGARD TO- CIVIL PENALTY- ANY FAR. STAR CHARISMA LIABLE FOR ANY TALKS ABOUT SO WE THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S FAR ABOVE AND BEYOND ARE CONCERNED REAL OVER ANY SOAP AND- SO WE HAVE THE SAME INTEREST IN REDUCING FIRES. NOT QUITE. YEAH JUST LOOKING AT A MAP HERE- I HEARD THIS MORNING FROM A- IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE OUR PURPOSE WAS YESTERDAY THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE GENIE'S CARE TORY AND I FIND A RISK AREAS. ARE. YES LANDS IN THEIR THE TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A THING- I THE BILL DOESN'T WORK I WOULD URGE MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS- TO TAKE. PHOTO LATER ON WHEN THE BILL COMES TO THE FLOOR BUT TO GIVE% PEOPLE A CHANCE TO WORK THIS OUT I DO THINK A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WITH BURKE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO AWAY IT'S GOING TO BE CERTAINLY A LOCAL ORDINANCE EVEN IF IT DOES. THIS IF THE FIGHT LOCAL FIRE CHIEFS ONE THEY CAN EITHER GET LOCAL ORDINANCE WHICH THEY CAN PROBABLY GAP.
