BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW WILL NOW COME TO ORDER AND THIS- HAS I THINK- EVERYONE IS WELL FAMILIAR WITH IN RESPONSE TO THE CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC LEGISLATORS AND EMPLOYEES WE MUST LIMIT NONESSENTIAL GATHERINGS AND IT HERE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING FACE COVERING GUIDELINES IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS ORDERS THE SENATORS MADE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TO NORMAL PRACTICES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE ARE HOLDING OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND TODAY ALL MEMBERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING. IN THE HEARING ROOM WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. AND FOR IN A PRIMARILY IT WILL BE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- FOR REMOTE PARTICIPANTS YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST MUTE YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER. AND I ASK WHEN YOU WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED YOU RAISE YOUR HAND FEATURE IN THE PROGRAM- THE R. I. T. PERSONNEL YOU WILL ON MEET YOURSELF AT THE I. T. PERSONNEL PUT YOU BACK ON YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE. TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC ACCESS REVISITED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE HEARING ROOM. AND WE ARE ALSO USING A TELECONFERENCE SERVICE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO TESTIFY TODAY.

AND THEN YOU WILL BE ON MUTED AND YOU'RE AT RISK YOU CAN ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE- I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING YES IT'S CUSTOMARY IN ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DESTRUCTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED. NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. HI SO I DON'T THINK IT WORKS FOR HIM. I'M NOT UNICORNS WERE GONNA HAVE TO BEGIN AS A- I ALWAYS FORGET WHAT THAT TERM IS SUBCOMMITTEE YES SUBCOMMITTEE BUT WE WILL GET FORM SOON AND MEMBERS IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE HEARING WOULD BE GREAT IF YOUWERE TO JOIN US IN THE CHAMBER SO THAT WE COULD ESTABLISH QUORUM. ALL RIGHT SO. WE WILL BEGIN THE SERIES. WE HAVE TWO BILLS BEFORE US TODAY WE HAVE A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AB ONE SIXTY NINE AND A HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT. THE URGENCY TO PASSING ABC ONE SIXTY EIGHT IS DUE TO AN UNPRECEDENTED COURT RULING THAT WOULD REQUIRE UC BERKELEY TO REDUCE IN PERSON ENROLLMENT. BY OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS THIS FALL THE COURT. A CAP ON YOU SEE ENROLLMENT FOR THIS FALL. AND AS TIME IS RUNNING OUT BECAUSE THE REMAINING OFFERS OF ADMISSION ARE SCHEDULED TO BE ISSUED ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH. IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO ACT TO HELP REMEDY THIS WE HAVE TO DO SO. PLEASE NOW THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THAT PARTICULAR IMPACT ON UC BERKELEY'S ENROLLMENT WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE LONG STANDING POLICY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ACTIONS BY THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE IN RECENT YEARS TO INCREASE THE FUNDING TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION ALL THREE SEGMENTS ARE PUBLIC IRE IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. NOW THE BILL AND THE STATUTE THAT AFFECTS LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS AFFECTS ALL PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS SO ANY COURT RULING ON THE STATUTE WHILE IT MAY BE SPECIFIC TO UC BERKELEY NOW IMPACTS ALL THREE. OF OUR PUBLIC CAR EDUCATION SEGMENTS COMMITTEE COLLEGES YES USE ANTI SEIZE. NOW THE BILL BEFORE US MAINTAINS THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUSES- MUST PREPARE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND THAT THEY MUST CONDUCT AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UNDER SEA QUEST. ON ALL ASPECTS OF THAT LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SO IN OTHER WORDS THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO SEE QUITE AS THEY HAVE BEEN. SINCE THE STATUTE WAS PUT IN PLACE I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. SO IT MAINTAINS THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LRT PIECE THAT FIRST THEY MUST PREPARE ALERT THE PEAS AND THAT THOSE ALLERGY PEACE ARE SUBJECT TO SEQUENCE HOWEVER WHAT THE BILL DOES IS MAKES CLEAR THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROJECT UNDER SEA QUEST. SO THE BILL ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA BERMAN A LAW DOES NOT TREAT STUDENT ROMAN DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER COMPONENT DIRECTIVITY CONTAINED IN A UC CSU OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THE CAMPUSES WOULD STILL HAVE TO CONSIDER. THE IMPACTS OF ALL OF ALL OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IN RELATIONSHIP TO THESE PLANS. NOW FIVE WE'VE WE'VE MY STAFF THE BUDGET STAFF OTHERS HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU SEE IN OTHERS AND YOU SEE LAWYERS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT POSE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS. I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL WHO WORKED SO HARD IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME ON THE DRAFTING OF THIS BILL. OUR SENATE BUDGET STAFF STAFF IN OUR PRO TEM'S OFFICE LEDGE COUNCIL OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET STAFF AND R. DECEMBER THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION SO THIS IS A VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. AND WAS WORKED OUT WITH ALL THREE PARTIES. WE WILL HEAR BOTH OF THE BILLS PRIOR TO A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. AND THEN ONCE WE'VE HEARD THE BILLS WE- OF COURSE MEMBERS YOU CAN ASKING QUESTIONS AND THEN WE WILL OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO LET ME SEE BEFORE WE I ASK- DOT OFFER LMAO. TWO PERCENT- MY VICE CHAIR SENATOR NELSON DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. OKAY ONE MOMENT. YEAH. LET ME FIRST MAKE SURE FIVE RATHER ASK OUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT MR SECOND SHOT TO ESTABLISH FORUM. SENATOR SKINNER PRESENT SKINNER PRESIDENT NELSON. NOTION HERE COVER YOUR CAREER HERE CORTESE POTATO HERE DOLLY TORONTO TORONTO HERE EGGMAN GROWTH. COM WATER LAYERED LEHRER HERE MAGUIRE MELINDA'S MAN. NEWMAN NEWMAN HERE- TROUBLE. PEN PEN HERE RAW ROB HERE HE EARNED BY CASKEY. MY COFFEE HERE. SO WE'VE NEVER ESTABLISH QUORUM WHICH IS GREAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S PRESENTATION ON THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AB ONE SIXTY NINE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. MADAM CHAIR CHRIS FERGUSON WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AB ONE SIXTY NINE IS A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT AMENDS THE CURRENT BUDGET ACT AMONG THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IS A REAPPROPRIATION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SUPPORT- COUNTY EFFORTS TO UPGRADE OR REPLACE. OR REPLACE OUT COUNTY VOTING SYSTEMS- ADDITIONALLY I'VE THE BUDGET BILL WILL. PROVIDE SOME MOB. PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO THE- THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING UP TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT FUNDS AROUND WITH THEM THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS SUBJECT TO JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE A NOTIFICATION- AND IT ALSO CONTAINS SEVERAL LIFE TECHNICAL DOCTOR APPOINTMENT. AND WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. THANK YOU MR IN AGAIN SO LET ME SEE IF MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST ON THIS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IN THE PROVISIONS HE JUST DESCRIBED. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEING NONE. WE WILL NOW GO TO. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH ARE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL PRESENT LMAO. YOU CAN CONCENTRATE SOLELY- AS THE CHAIR NOTED OF THE TRAILER BILL BEFORE YOU AMENDS ONE SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT ALSO KNOWN SYKORA AND THIS SECTION PARTICULARLY RELATES TO PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. YOU CAN SEE THE SIX KEY PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ON THE LAST PAGE OF YOUR AGENDA PROVISIONS RELATE TO ENROLLMENT IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS. ALL THE BILL WOULD LEAD TO AN EXISTING PROVISION- SPECIFICALLY REQUIRING PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE ROMAN ROSE THAT'S PART OF THEIR LONG RANGE LAND USE OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS ALSO KNOWN AS ALLERGY PEAS. AND IT SPECIFIES THAT INVOLVEMENT IN IT OF ITSELF DOES NOT TRIGGER THE SEQUEL PROCESS. THE NEXT TWO DECISIONS NEXT THE NEXT TWO ITEMS RELATE TO- COURT DECISIONS. WERE THE COURT IN A FUTURE CASE TO DETERMINE THAT- A CAMPUSES TOTAL POPULATION EXCEEDS PROJECTIONS OF SPECIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENT ALLERGY P. THE COURT COULD REQUIRE THE CAMPUS TO SUBMIT A REPORT ASSESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THAT EXCESS POPULATION. AND IF THE CAMPUS IS NOT ABLE TO CERTIFY WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS A NEW REPORT- AFTER THE COURT'S ORDER. THE ACCORD WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION ON THE EXCESS POPULATION. IN THE FINAL TWO CHANGES OR AROUND EXISTING COURT INJUNCTIONS THE BILL WOULD SPECIFY THAT ANY CURRENT INJECTION INJECTION OR JUDGMENT AFFECTING ENROLLMENT. WELL WOULD BE UNENFORCEABLE. AND IT SPECIFIES THAT THIS PROVISION AS WELL YEAH AS WELL AS THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL- ARE RETROACTIVE. AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD APPROPRIATE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- LET ME SEE NOW IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS. ON- THAT BILL THAT IS BEFORE US. I DON'T THINK MR DOLLY IS HERE HIS NAME IS MARK ROGERS UP BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE SO. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO QUESTIONS- WE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AND LET'S START AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN OUR- GALLERY. AND WE WILL BE.

YEAH THE UNIVERSITY EXAM IN A COMMUNITY AND THAT COMMUNITY- A COMMUNITY TO WHICH THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND COST THE CITY MILLION EMERGENCY SERVICE THERE IS AN IMPACT ROAD. AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND I THINK THAT FOR YEARS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE UNIVERSITY- MISMANAGED FUNDS AND- STRUGGLE TO PAY THE BILLS- AND IN TURN- REALLY IT WILL REALLYDOESN'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE UNIVERSITY CAN YOU STRAIGHT TUITION AND- EVER MORE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS.

YOU CAN BET BECAUSE SO MANY MANAGERS YOU HAVE TO ADMIT NEW STUDENTS AND SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT THAT- WOULDN'T SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH- AND JUST ALLOW STUDENT- AN INDIAN LEE IS RATHER ABSURD I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING THAT- I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR YOU. COULD YOU HAVE A NICE WE ARE IT'S ONE MINUTE PER SPEAKER SO IF YOU COULD WRAP. OH SURE YEAH I MEAN WE'RE ALL TAKING TIME OUT OF OUR DAY TO PARTICIPATE IN IT AND I THINK.

HI MY NAME'S PHIL BLOCK AWAY I HAVE TWO DEGREES AND- WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL WITH US SENATOR SKINNER- WE OPPOSE INCREASING YOU SEE BEADS IN A ROMAN UNDER SB ONE EIGHTEEN FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE MORE STUDENTS THAN 10% OF CURRENT BERKELEY STUDENTS SUFFER HOMELESSNESS DURING THEIR EDUCATION.

IN ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WILL- PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET INCREASE RENTS FOR EVERYBODY GETTING LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME NON STUDENT FAMILY ARTIST. DON'T WANT NEW STUDENTS TO HAVE TO LIVE IN CARS CAMPERS AND ALL ROOMS LIKE THEY'RE DOING. BARBARA THERE IS A REAL EQUITY ISSUE AT STAKE HERE THOUGH UC BERKELEY HAS TURNED TO ADMITTING MORE NON RESIDENTS TO GENERATE REVENUE INSTEAD OF RESIDENT STUDENTS ARE OFTEN LOW INCOME AND THE. IT WOULD SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRING BERKELEY TO. BUILD HOUSING BEFORE IT IT MADE ME AN- BUT NOW ON. THANK YOU. METROLAND FOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS COURTNEY SMITH- I AM ALSO A TWO TIME GRADUATE OF BERKELEY I'VE WORKED AT UC BERKELEY- MY SON GOT HIS PHD AT UC BERKELEY- I OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY- WHO WAITED A CRISIS HERE WITH THE SELF MADE CRISIS IF THEY'D KNOWN ABOUT THAT THE HOUSING- GAP.

DECREASED PRECIPITOUSLY SO RATHER THAN RUSH TO JUDGMENT WITH THIS BILL LIKE I THINK IT THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE REASON LOOK AT WHAT THE IMPACT REALLY IS YEAH IN BERKELEY.

AT THE SAME TIME AS SOMEONE WHO TAUGHT CONTRACTS LAW I WOULD MAKE THIS OBSERVATION WE MADE AN OFFER TO THE STUDENTS- THAT OFFER WAS ONE THAT THEY RELIED ON- WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE AN IMPERATIVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING GOOD ON OUR PROMISES THAT'S AT THE CORE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AGOOD SOCIETY THE CORE OF AMERICA AND OUR CAPITALIST SOCIETY SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHORS OF THIS FOR TRYING TO COME TO CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA AND LEGISLATURE. ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HONOR OUR COMMITMENT TO THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN SENATOR JOE BOTH. HI GOOD MORNING. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE OVERALL UMBRELLA IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THOUGH SOMEONE WHO TRULY APPRECIATES THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AND THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS TO YOU FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES I JUST WANT TO JUST EMPHASIZE RIGHT NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING SECRET REFORM AS A WHOLE NOT JUST SPECIFICALLY TO THE PROJECTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT BUT JUST IN IN OVERALL. I INTEND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TACKLE THE- AND PART OF IT THE C. QUOTE- GUIDELINES. ALSO I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE COST OF HOUSING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. IN THE IN THE EFFORT THAT WE MUST MAKE AS A LEGISLATURE TO ASSURE THAT- OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE THE HOUSING THAT THEY NEED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT STUDENTS AT. A COMMITTEE OUR OUR OFFER TO COME INTO OUR UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE OTHERWISE THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY- THE COST OF- ABD GOING TO SCHOOL IS SO IT'S PART OF ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO GO TO SCHOOL- I'M IN CALIFORNIA. HOUSING IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT AND WE MAKE A GREATER IMPACT ON IT THE COST OF HOUSING FOR BOTH PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AS WELL FOR STUDENTS BECOMING INCREASINGLY INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I TRULY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THOUGH THIS IS NEEDED. IT WILL HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE COST OF HOUSING- OVERALL SO THANK YOU I WILL BE SUPPORTING- ON THIS BILL BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE. ON THE COST OF HOUSING FOR BOTH OUR STUDENTS WERE COMING IN THE COST OF SCHOOLING AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO RISE UP THIS IS I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T COUNT HOW MANY TIMES NOW- IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE HAVE DONE EXEMPT IT SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS AND I HAVE VOTED FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR- THIS EXEMPTION AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS HAVING A HOUSING CRISIS IN THESE IN THIS SEQUEL LAW HAS BEEN ABUSED- QUITE FRANKLY BY LABOR IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN ABUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS IT'S BEEN ABUSED BY BUSINESS AGAINST BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO DO SOME REFORM IN THIS AREA- THIS IS THE MOTHER MAY I. SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GET AN EXEMPTION. AND THAT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA THAT WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD TO DRIVE THE COST OF HOUSING DOWN TO DRIVE THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES THAT WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL SO I JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATORS TO LOOK AT- SEQUEL REFORM SO THAT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THE ONES THAT ARE- CARVED OUT- CAN MOVE FORWARD OR WE CAN DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING DOWN FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN. AND MAKE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS SENATOR COM ORDER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST- WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU ALSO TO THE STUDENTS WHO SHOWED UP IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU EVEN THOUGH IT IS FINALS WEEK YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO GET OUT AND COME HERE AND- REMIND US WHY WE DO THE WORK THAT WE DO- I AGREE STUDENTS ARE NOT POLLUTANTS AND- IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT HOUSING HAS BECOME A ZERO SUM GAME NOW- THAT HAS NOW MOVED TO TARGET. STUDENTS I THINK IN THIS STATE WE CAN HAVE A SKILLED WORK FORCE THAT CAN BUILD HOUSING THAT PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY AND LIVE IN WITHOUT HAVING TO WORK- TEEN JOBS. BEEN STRESSING OUT THEIR FAMILY AND THIS IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF THAT AND I WELCOME ALL FOLKS TO THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT VISION AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. MEASURE TODAY. FINNERTY OFTEN DO YOU HAVE YOUR MARKUP SPEAK TO THIS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS EXEMPTION AS I HAVE. ALL THE GOOD EXEMPTIONS. BUT I WOULD ADMONISH EVEN THE STUDENTS WHO NOW HAVE THEIR OX GORED THEY'RE SPEAKING UP THANK YOU STUDENTS BUT DON'T PRAY SICK WHAT. SEQUEL HAS WHAT AGGRIEVED YOU HEAR. SUPPORT BROAD SICK WHAT REFORMS WE DO NOT DO THAT WE PIECEMEAL THINGS WERE GIVEN PROJECTS LIKE STADIUMS. I'M REMINDED OF A HOMELESS ADVOCATES A FEW YEARS AGO COMEDY TO ME AT A PUBLIC FORUM YOU KNOW WE COULD BUILD SHELTERS HOUSING FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CHEAPER UNITS WHERE THEIR SEQUEL REFORM. THAT'S INSTRUCTIVE IT ISN'T JUST BIG BUSINESSES IN MAJOR DEVELOPERS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN WE'RE ADDRESSING SEQUEL REFORM. WE CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT DO IT JUST FOR STUDENT HOUSING. AND PIECEMEAL THE WAY THAT WE HAVE DONE IT. THUS FAR. THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN AND SUPPORT. TO SUPPORT MUCH BROADER DEEPER. SEQUEL REFORM. BECAUSE IT'S AFFECTING OUR STATE. OUR CITIZENS. AND OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I DO URGE THOUGH AND I WILL. SENATOR LAYERED. GIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO- MAKE SOME COMMENTS THAT ONE OF THE SPEAKERS REQUESTED CLARITY AND AFTER THIS DEBATE I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A LITTLE CLARITY ARE THERE WAS A VERY UNIQUE PART OF THE STATUTE THAT LED TO THE COURT CASE. THAT CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY ENROLLMENT AS A- AS A PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS THIS ISN'T ABOUT SEQUIN GENERAL IT IS THE WAY THAT WAS DONE. AND THAT WAS AN OVERREACH OF REALLY ENROLLMENT SHOULD NOT BE A PROJECT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THAT WE'VE HEARD THE TESTIMONY THIS BILL IS AN ELEGANT FIX TO THAT AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR. BUT SOMEHOW THE SPEECHES ED TURNED US INTO A LARGER ISSUE AND IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. I THINK LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM I COULD BE WRONG. BUT I THINK I'M THE ONLY FORMER MAYOR OF A CITY THAT HOSTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THERE OFF THE TAX ROLLS. IN OUR TOWN IT'S ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. INSIDE A CITY OF SIXTY THOUSAND THAT IS COMPLETELY OFF THE TAX ROLLS. SO ARE THEY FELT GUILTY ABOUT COMPETING WITH OUR HOTEL INDUSTRY SO THEY VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT THE ROOM TAX SAYING THEY'RE NOT WAVING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. BUT THEY DO IT. ARM IN HE HE YOU KNOW THE IRONY OF IRONIES IS GIVEN THE DEBATE. THAT WE HAVE FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING IN SANTA CRUZ BECAUSE OF C. CORE. UNIVERSITY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. SINCE THERE ARE NO LOCAL LAND USE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY LOCAL TAXES. ANY LOCAL JURISDICTION. WE ARE NEGOTIATIONS WITH C. KUO MADE AS A PRIORITY BUILDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING ON CAMPUS. AND SO FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS EXIST BECAUSE OF C. CORE. IF YOU WERE TO REMOVE SEAPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE A 100% GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. AND IT REALLY EXISTS FOR FACULTY IT EXISTS FOR STAFF AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS. OF THE CONSTRUCTION I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE THE- SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION THIS YEAR. AND WE WORKED ON THE FLOOR WE WERE TRYING TO. ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING FACTORS WE HAD A DISCUSSION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEARING BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW THAT THIS LAWSUIT WAS OUT THERE. WERE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WAS. YOU'RE JAMMING ALL ADDITIONAL MOMENT IN THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT OF THE CAMPUSES WHAT PLAN DO YOU HAVE OVER TIME. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GROWTH CAN BE ACCOMMODATED BECAUSE THIS REALLYIS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. AND THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT CAMPUS AFTER CAMPUS WORDS CAN EXCEED ITS CAPACITY IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE NEW CAMPUSES ARE NEW CENTERS OFF THE CAMP THIS. OR RE STUFF AND WE ADDRESSED. LAST YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR HOUSING. ONE OVERALL TWO BILLION OVER THREE YEARS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES C. S. HOUSTON YOU SIS AND WHEN WE HAD OUR HEARING WE FIND ITS OVER SUBSCRIBED ON THE FIRST YEAR THIRTY THREE POINT ONE BILLION OF REQUESTS FOR THE TWO BILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR OF A THREE YEAR PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT- WHEN WE MOVED TO THIS BUDGET IS WHETHER WE AUGMENT THAT BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE. ARE THE HOUSING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND SO. IT N. WE ALSO ADDRESS THE ISSUE LAST YEAR THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. ABOUT PRIORITIZING SOME IN STATE STUDENTS OVER OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. SO THAT BASICALLY THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN PAYING TAXES. FOR GENERATIONS CAN HAVE THEIR KIDS GO TO UC. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS LIKE A SIMPLE REFORM ISSUE. THIS ADDRESSES THE ISSUE IN FRONT OF US IN THE RIGHT WAY. BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE HOUSING WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE SPACES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THAT THAT ALLOW FOR THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE SEQUEL ACTUALLY ADDRESSES FACULTY AND STAFF INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE FACULTY AND STAFF THAT MATCHED THE STUDENTS. THERE'S AN ALLEGATION AND MY- OUR HOME COMMUNITY WHICH IS HOTLY DISPUTED. THAT ALL THE STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED BUT THE BUILDINGS AND THE PROJECTIONS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF OR NOT AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON ALL THOSE OTHER ISSUES AND I WANT THEM TO BE SEPARATE FROM THIS. BECAUSE WE ARE FIXING A PROBLEM AND A LOT TODAY AND MAKING SURE THOSE STUDENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTED IN BERKELEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO. SO ARE STRONGLY. READ DENIED. BUT ALSO THAT WE FOUGHT THROUGH WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE GOING FOR. THANK YOU MR ALERTS WE HAVE A MOTION AND BEFORE I ASK THE MR STEPHAN CHARTER CALL THE RULE WE JUST SPEAK TO A FEW POINTS. ON D. D. FOR THIRTY YEARS. WE HAVE HAD STATUTE IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THAT REQUIRES OUR THREE HIGHER PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS TO DO LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUBJECT TO SEQUENCE AND DURING THAT TIME THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS SENTENCE THAT SAID. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT WOULD BE EVALUATED NOW IN THAT THIRTY YEARS WELL THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY MANY MANY LAWSUITS- REGARDING THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WE'VE YET HAD A COURT. IDENTIFY THAT DID. THE STATUTE AS REQUIRING STUDENT ENROLLMENT AS A SEPARATE AND A PROJECT INTO AN ITSELF UNDER SECRET. AND THAT BUT A COURT IN THIS CASE DID SO. WHILE THE THIRTY YEARS THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IT DID NOW SO THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES AS A MISTER LORD POINTED OUT. WE ARE CORRECTING HOWEVER WE'RE CORRECTING IT DUE TO THAT THIS MOST RECENT COURT RULING NOW THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT WE IN REVIEWING THE STATUTE. WHILE IT PRESERVES AT HIM AND RIGHTFULLY SO THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY THE ABILITY TO REQUIREMENT TO DO NO RDP AND THAT IT'S SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT. WHAT IT DOES IS BY PULLING OUT THAT ONE SENTENCE IT IS NOT- PRESUPPOSE THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT ALONE. IS THE SOLAR PRIMARY IMPACT BECAUSE AS WE KNOW EVERYONE OF OUR CAMPUSES HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT- COMPONENTS IF WE TAKE UCSF FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE MEDICAL CENTER THEY'RE PROBABLY FAR MORE PATIENTS STAFF AND DOCTORS. WHO GO IN AND OUT OF UCSF EVERYDAY THAN THERE ARE STUDENTS SO OBVIOUSLY AN ENVIRONMENT A REVIEW OF A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT CAMPUS WOULD HAVE TO FACTOR THOSE THINGS AND OBVIOUSLY NOT. SOLELY IN NLY THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT OR IT WOULDN'T BE A VERY ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. NOW THE OTHER THING THAT I FOUND. INTERESTING IS THAT IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT IN VARIOUS- FOLKS CALLED AND SAID YOU KNOW THE REAL ISSUE IS BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH HOUSING- ON WE HALF AS SENATOR LAYERED POINTED OUT. WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS AND IN WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE DID IT IN WE'VE HAD DONE IT FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT WE HAVE. ALLOCATED SIGNIFICANT FUNDS IN THE LAST BUDGET. TO BILLION OVER A COUPLE YEAR PERIOD FOR STUDENT HOUSING BUT AS POINTED OUT IS ALREADY OVER SUBSCRIBED TO CLEARLY WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT FOR THIS BUDGET. BUT INTERESTINGLY IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR USE BERKELEY AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHILE I WAS NOT MAYOR. I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER IN THAT CITY AND GIVEN THAT BOTH SANTA CRUZ AND BERKELEY OUR CITY MANAGER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT I THINK OUR ROLES WERE IN THE IN TERMS OF JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY SEMI SIMILAR- WE. ARE VOTERS PASSED AN ORDINANCE THE NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION ORDINANCE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THAT IN EFFECT PREVENTED CHANGE THE ZONING SUCH A PRETTY MUCH LIMITED THE ABILITY FOR THERE TO BE MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS BUILT IN BERKELEY FOR YEARS FOR DECADES. NOW IF YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION OF. THE LACK OF STUDENT HOUSING PROVIDED BY THE ACTUAL. CAMPUS ENTITY ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT IS BASICALLY. CAPITALIZING YOU'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM LIKE THIS BUT IT DOESN'T YOU CANNOT POINT ONLY A FINGER AT ONE OF THE ENTITIES SO IN OTHER WORDS WELL WE WANT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING OUR HIGH HOUSING CRISIS SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE OTHER COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER THEY'VE DONE SO SIMILARLY BUT I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE FACING IS THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE NOT AS WILLING TO BUILD THE HOUSING THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR STATE NEEDS SO WHILE THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT IT'SCERTAINLY ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF THE CAP THAT THE COURT PUT RIGHT NOW ONE STUDENT ENROLLMENT FOR THIS FALL FOR UC BERKELEY AND IN THE LONG TERM AT LEAST MAKES ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN HAVE TO BE ASSESSED WITHOUT PREJUDICING STUDENT ENROLLMENT ALONE SO. WE'LL NOW TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON SENATOR LAYERED MOTION- MR STOP AND SHOP PLEASE READ THE ROLE. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS SENATORS SCANNER HI SKINNER HI NELSON. NELSON HI CAREER CAREER I CORTESE CORTESE I. DALI. ALI HI RAZA. BROWSER HI ADNAN. THEY MAY I GROW MARKER. LAYERED. LAYERED HI REQUIRE. CHOIR HI MELINDA'S. MAN MAN I NEWMAN. NEWMAN I FEEL BOTH.

OUR AT THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW IS NOW CONCLUDED.
