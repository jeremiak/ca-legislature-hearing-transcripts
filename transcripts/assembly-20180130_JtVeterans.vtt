00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:06.624 region:rollup2
THE OPTIMAL USE OF HOPE OF THE

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:08.626 region:rollup2
HOMES IN THE FUTURE.

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:09.794 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY WE WILL THEN HAVE

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:11.429 region:rollup2
THE NECESSARY POLICY POLICY

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:12.864 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:15.433 region:rollup2
WHICH I HOPE WILL LEAD TO AN

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:17.235 region:rollup2
INFORMED CONSENSUS.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:18.770 region:rollup2
IN I RECEIVED A DOZEN QUESTIONS

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.738 region:rollup2
FOR TO CONSIDER BEFORE TODAY'S

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.940 region:rollup2
HEARINGS.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:26.511 region:rollup2
I READ THE MALL AND I WOULD

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:27.745 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZE MOST OF THEM THIS WAY.

00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:30.081 region:rollup2
SECRETARY BASANTI IF THE MASTER

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:30.715 region:rollup2
PLAN RESULTS IN A RADICALLY

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:32.584 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT VERSION VISION OF THE

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:34.586 region:rollup2
HOMES.

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:36.287 region:rollup2
WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO WAIT.

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:38.456 region:rollup2
FOR THAT FINAL VISION TO EMERGE

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:40.258 region:rollup2
BEFORE MAKING ANY.

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:41.559 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:43.595 region:rollup2
SUCH AS A NEW SNIFF.

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:45.663 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:47.565 region:rollup2
MY IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WOULD BE

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:49.968 region:rollup2
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT.

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:51.402 region:rollup2
IF THERE WERE NO VETERANS HOMES.

00:37:49.968 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
AND IF THE HOMES ARCHITECTURE

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:56.307 region:rollup2
WERE BEING CREATED OPOVO FROM

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:58.576 region:rollup2
SCRATCH TODAY. AND MAPPED OUT

00:37:56.307 --> 00:38:00.578 region:rollup2
UPON A FRESH BLANK PAGE

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:02.680 region:rollup2
WAITING WOULD IN FACT BE THE

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.281 region:rollup2
MOST PRUDENT COURSE OF ACTION.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.716 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE FACT OF THE MATTER

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.683 region:rollup2
IS.

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:07.485 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT STARTING WITH A TABULA

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:08.453 region:rollup2
RASA.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:10.722 region:rollup2
YOUNG FELIZ FAR FROM A BLANK

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:12.023 region:rollup2
PAGE.

00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:14.058 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOUNG FILLS FEATURES

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:16.060 region:rollup2
ALREADY EMBODIED DECADES EVEN A

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:17.428 region:rollup2
CENTURY OF ARCHITECTURAL

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.197 region:rollup2
TRADITIONS AND GROWTH.

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:20.765 region:rollup2
AND FURTHERMORE.

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:22.700 region:rollup2
SOME REPRESENT LARGE PRE

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.568 region:rollup2
EXISTING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OR

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.103 region:rollup2
ARE THE SUBJECT OF LONG TERM

00:38:23.568 --> 00:38:26.905 region:rollup2
LEASES.

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:28.239 region:rollup2
YES

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:30.441 region:rollup2
THERE'S A BOUNTY OF UNDEVELOPED

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:32.577 region:rollup2
SPACE ON THE CAMPUS ROOM FOR NEW

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:34.879 region:rollup2
IDEAS AND EVEN SOME ABILITY TO

00:38:32.577 --> 00:38:37.182 region:rollup2
REPURPOSE EXISTING BUILDINGS.

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:38.783 region:rollup2
NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:40.919 region:rollup2
FEATURES OF THE OWN FILL CAMPUS

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:42.954 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE WHICH AS A PRACTICAL

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:44.255 region:rollup2
MATTER ARE IMMUTABLE.

00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:45.990 region:rollup2
AS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:47.592 region:rollup2
FACILITY OF ITS KIND IN THE

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.660 region:rollup2
NATION THE ON FIELD VETERANS

00:38:47.592 --> 00:38:50.895 region:rollup2
HOME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.263 region:rollup2
FLAGSHIP OF THE CALVERT SYSTEM.

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:54.365 region:rollup2
IT HAS PROVIDED CARE AND

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:55.266 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN AN ICONIC SETTING

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:57.068 region:rollup2
FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:58.736 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS.

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:00.071 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:01.072 region:rollup2
ARE VERY WELL AWARE THE CAMPUS

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.874 region:rollup2
HAS A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:04.642 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:06.477 region:rollup2
THE BUILDINGS ARE OLD. THE

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:08.880 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INEFFICIENT

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:12.684 region:rollup2
AND THE DESIGN REFLECTS BUILDING

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.886 region:rollup2
STANDARDS OF GENERATIONS PAST.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:16.654 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE PARTICULAR

00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:18.456 region:rollup2
CASE OF THE YOUNG FILL STAFF.

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:19.557 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING WHICH IS HOME TO

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:22.660 region:rollup2
OUR MOST VULNERABLE VETERAN

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:24.329 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ALSO HAS SERIOUS ACUTE

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.830 region:rollup2
AND COSTLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:27.632 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.601 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE REALITY.

00:39:27.632 --> 00:39:31.669 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PUT WE CANNOT AND SHOULD

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:33.037 region:rollup2
NOT WAIT FOR THE OUTCOME OF AN

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:35.340 region:rollup2
EXTENDED PRODUCT PLANNING

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:37.308 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHICH I AM CONVINCED

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.744 region:rollup2
THAT MY HEART WILL NOT DEVIATE

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:41.579 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PRE. PRESUPPOSITIONS

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:44.349 region:rollup2
BEFORE REPLACING THE EXISTING

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.383 region:rollup2
SNIFF BUILDINGS.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.418 region:rollup2
HERE WE ARE TODAY IN TWENTY

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:49.354 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN DISCUSSING THIS.

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:51.122 region:rollup2
WHAT CALVET RECOGNIZE THE NEED

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:53.291 region:rollup2
FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:54.926 region:rollup2
OF THE ANFAL CAMPUS AS FAR BACK

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:56.861 region:rollup2
AS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE?

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:58.463 region:rollup2
IT CONTRACTED THEN WITH AN

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:59.797 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING

00:39:58.463 --> 00:40:02.200 region:rollup2
FIRM HELLMUTH OBATA AND

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:04.769 region:rollup2
KASSEBAUM TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.903 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN FOR THE PROPERTY.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
THIS MASTER PLAN RESULTED IN AN

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.573 region:rollup2
EXPERT.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:10.141 region:rollup2
ROAD MAP

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:12.277 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTING THE MOST URGENT AND

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:13.945 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD

00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:15.647 region:rollup2
BRING THE DOWNFALL CAMPUS TO ITS

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:16.347 region:rollup2
FULL POTENTIAL INCLUDING

00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:18.917 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT OF THE SNIFF

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:20.418 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:21.853 region:rollup2
SO THE CURRENT BOLD

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:23.321 region:rollup2
BOTH THE CURRENT BUDGET IS THE

00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:24.923 region:rollup2
FIRST TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR THIS

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:26.257 region:rollup2
NEW STAFF.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:28.026 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ACTUALLY YEARS A

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:31.262 region:rollup2
PRIOR CALVET PLANNING WHICH LED

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:32.196 region:rollup2
TO THIS PCP.

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.598 region:rollup2
FINALLY AS THE GOVERNOR

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:36.200 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED IN HIS PROPOSED

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:37.902 region:rollup2
BUDGET A DELAY IN REPLACING THE

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.470 region:rollup2
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WOULD

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:41.005 region:rollup2
BE A FAILURE TO PROVIDE THAT TO

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.974 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE BEST CARE FOR OUR

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:45.143 region:rollup2
VETERANS. AND WOULD BE A WASTE

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:47.712 region:rollup2
OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

00:40:45.143 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
WHY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:50.948 region:rollup2
MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.184 region:rollup2
HAS BEENSENT SPENT ON

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:54.485 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS TO PATCH

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:56.321 region:rollup2
YOUNG FILLS ANTIQUATED

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:58.189 region:rollup2
FACILITIES? JUST TO KEEP THE

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:59.324 region:rollup2
HOME OPERATING.

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.892 region:rollup2
YES I'M PROUD THAT WE HAVE

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:03.294 region:rollup2
MANAGED TO PROVIDE FIVE STAR

00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
CARE USING PATCHWORK AND

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:08.199 region:rollup2
MAKESHIFT REPAIRS. HOWEVER THIS

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.167 region:rollup2
IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION.

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.168 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE CRITICAL

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.703 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE SNIFF

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:13.237 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT.

00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:14.972 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT IGNORE THE

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:16.975 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR MOST

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:17.875 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT RESIDENTS.

00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:20.278 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR WELL DESERVED QUALITY

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:22.246 region:rollup2
OF LIFE.

00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:24.449 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS IN OUR DOMICILIARY

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:25.450 region:rollup2
PROGRAM MAY NOT REQUIRE ROUND

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:26.918 region:rollup2
THE CLOCK ATTENTION FROM OUR

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.986 region:rollup2
NURSES.

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DON'T FILL IS THEIR HOME

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:32.857 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE HEARD EARNS THE

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:34.659 region:rollup2
VERY BEST WE CAN OFFER.

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:36.794 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT DOMICILIARY BUILDING

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:38.930 region:rollup2
CONFIGURATION IS BUILT ON A

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:41.466 region:rollup2
MILITARY BARRACKS MODEL WHICH IS

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.001 region:rollup2
OUTDATED EVEN ON MODERN MILITARY

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:44.769 region:rollup2
INSTALLATIONS AND WHICH

00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:46.070 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOES NOT REFLECT THE

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:48.039 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WHICH GUIDE

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.207 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF A SIMILAR. LONG

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.908 region:rollup2
TERM BECAUSE A CARE FACILITY

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:53.044 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:55.246 region:rollup2
TO THAT END WE HAVE PROPOSED

00:41:53.044 --> 00:41:57.215 region:rollup2
MODIFYING OUR ROOM ASSIGNMENTS

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:59.917 region:rollup2
SO THAT EACH OF THESE RESIDENTS

00:41:57.215 --> 00:42:02.320 region:rollup2
HAS HIS OR HER OWN ROOM.

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:03.388 region:rollup2
THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.623 region:rollup2
A DROP IN THE DEMAND FOR

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:07.291 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT LIVING.

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.960 region:rollup2
RECONFIGURING OUR INDEPENDENT

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:11.129 region:rollup2
LIVING BUILDINGS TO A SINGLE

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.398 region:rollup2
OCCUPANCY MODEL. REPRESENTS A

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:15.133 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT IS MUCH EASIER AND

00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:17.068 region:rollup2
MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A MAJOR

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:18.836 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:20.772 region:rollup2
YET MAKE NO MISTAKE IT WILL MEAN

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:22.573 region:rollup2
A WORLD OF IMPROVEMENT FOR THESE

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:24.208 region:rollup2
VALUED MEMBERS OF OUR HOME.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.943 region:rollup2
I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE A

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.478 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:29.414 region:rollup2
THE DOMICILIARY SETTING WITH

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:30.681 region:rollup2
THEIR SPOUSES.

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:33.785 region:rollup2
AND THIS MOVE TOWARD SINGLE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:35.086 region:rollup2
ROOMS WILL NOT AFFECT COUPLES.

00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:37.255 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVES FOR SNIFF AN

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:38.756 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT LIVING THE BOOKENDS

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:40.725 region:rollup2
OF OUR LONG TERM CARE OFFERINGS

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:42.560 region:rollup2
CANNOT WAIT.

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:44.295 region:rollup2
OTHER REFINEMENTS AND EVOLUTIONS

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.030 region:rollup2
IN THE HOMES ARE CLEARLY NEEDED

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:48.066 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.400 region:rollup2
OUR VETERANS. WE EMBRACE THE

00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:51.169 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE MANDATES TO PLAN FOR

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.470 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:54.439 region:rollup2
WHERE ENCOURAGED BY THE WEALTH

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.807 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT AND THE OUT POURING

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.942 region:rollup2
OF IDEAS FROM THE LOCAL

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:59.343 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND BEYOND? AND WE

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:01.779 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE VAST DOWNFALL

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:04.082 region:rollup2
CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR OFFERS AN

AN UNTAPPED I WOULD SAY VAST BUT

00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:04.241 region:rollup2
AN UNTAPPED POTENTIAL FOR

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:14.851 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO LOST MORE ON THE

FOR ADMISSION. THAT WILL ENHANCE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:20.857 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PER DIEM REVENUE TO US.

.

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:25.495 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:26.663 region:rollup2
.

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:27.097 region:rollup2
YES RIGHT THANK YOU THE OTHER

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:28.799 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO.

00:59:27.097 --> 00:59:31.401 region:rollup2
HELPED ME MANDATE THAT ALL

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:32.636 region:rollup2
VETERANS HAVE FEDERAL STATE OR

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:35.205 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INSURANCE.

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:37.007 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:37.574 region:rollup2
ADD TO MAXIMIZE REVENUE.

00:59:37.007 --> 00:59:39.643 region:rollup2
SO I EXPECT TO DO THAT RIGHT

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:41.578 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:43.346 region:rollup2
WHEN I CAME IN TWO AND A HALF

00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:45.816 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WE WERE RECOUPING

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:47.451 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR

00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:48.919 region:rollup2
SPENT ON LOW. CHAIR AND I

00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:49.152 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WANT THAT NUMBER TO GO

00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:49.920 region:rollup2
NORTH.

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:51.755 region:rollup2
.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.457 region:rollup2
I THINK

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:53.790 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT IS PROBABLY AN

00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:56.159 region:rollup2
UNREALISTIC.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.328 region:rollup2
.

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.762 region:rollup2
GOAL BUT GETTING CLOSE TO FIFTY

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.665 region:rollup2
PERCENT MIGHT NOT BE

00:59:58.762 --> 01:00:04.000 region:rollup2
UNREALISTIC.

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:05.802 region:rollup2
HA ONE STATE NEW YORK STATE.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.537 region:rollup2
ES MAKES A PROFIT ON ITS

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:09.306 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOME BUT ONLY BY

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.373 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING ADMISSION TO THOSE

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.943 region:rollup2
WITH SEVENTY PERCENT OR GREATER

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:13.477 region:rollup2
DISABILITY. AND I THINK IF WE

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.512 region:rollup2
WERE TO DO THAT.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:17.247 region:rollup2

CRUNCH WHICH I THINK PUT SOME.

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:43.092 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE CAPACITY NUMBERS

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:45.628 region:rollup2
IN SUSPENSE.

CHALLENGES IN OUR OLDER HOMES

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:53.903 region:rollup2

IT IS A CONCERN OF OURS AND WE

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.915 region:rollup2
SEE THAT.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.783 region:rollup2
.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.251 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE WE GET.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:10.453 region:rollup2
CONFIRMATION OF A MASTER PLAN

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.821 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.356 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUTURE GOING FORWARD.

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.257 region:rollup2
WILL REASSESS THAT OBVIOUSLY IF

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:15.325 region:rollup2
THERE'S A IF THERE'S AN

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.693 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO REPURPOSE THAT

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:18.361 region:rollup2
SPACE.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:19.596 region:rollup2
A IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.663 region:rollup2
WILL CONSIDER SENSE ESPECIALLY

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:22.165 region:rollup2
SINCE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PATH

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:24.534 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.435 region:rollup2
OF OF LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITY YOU

01:08:24.534 --> 01:08:26.536 region:rollup2
KNOW PHIL.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.037 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS BARSTOW AND THOSE

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:30.173 region:rollup2
ARE THE TWO MAIN AREAS THAT THAT

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:31.641 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH CAPACITY

01:08:30.173 --> 01:08:33.142 region:rollup2
AND AND VERSES BUDGETED SO.

01:08:31.641 --> 01:08:34.644 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT THERE WAS A REASON

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:35.611 region:rollup2
FOR IT AND THEN THERE'S JUST NO

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.313 region:rollup2
DEMAND WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.948 region:rollup2
THOSE SO WHAT WILL WILL GO BACK

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:40.350 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT THAT WE CONTINUED

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.251 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT SO YOU KNOW I

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.553 region:rollup2
FIGURE YOU CAN GO TO. NOW NOT

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.687 region:rollup2
NOT TODAY BUT I CAN GET YOU AN

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:45.989 region:rollup2
ANSWER YEAH I'D BE CURIOUS WITH

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.556 region:rollup2
THE DELTA IS ON THAT JUST

01:08:45.989 --> 01:08:48.391 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF THERE'S

01:08:46.556 --> 01:08:49.258 region:rollup2
CAPACITY YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO

01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:50.293 region:rollup2
SEE IT THERE BUT NOW YOU KNOW

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.160 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I'M

01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:52.829 region:rollup2
I'M DOWN A HUNDRED. AND TWENTY

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.329 region:rollup2
TWO DOMICILIARY IN YOUNTVILLE

01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:55.898 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:57.200 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN ICF AND THAT'S

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:58.234 region:rollup2
JUST ON BUDGET NUMBERS.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.602 region:rollup2
IT'S ALREADY OFF THE TOP OF OUR

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:01.104 region:rollup2
BUDGET NUMBERS AND WELL BELOW

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:05.108 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET NUMBERS WHICH PUTS US

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:05.742 region:rollup2
WELL BELOW OUR CAPACITY FOR.

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:07.076 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT RANDY GET AT

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:08.645 region:rollup2
YEAH SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:10.013 region:rollup2
TO KNOW WHAT YOU WHAT WE BUILT A

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.080 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU MONEY FOR.

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:12.448 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY USING

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.650 region:rollup2
SCISSORS TWENTY DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.450 region:rollup2
NOT SIZE OF OUR QUESTION

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:15.018 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY AND WILL CERTAINLY

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.285 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT CONSIDERATION AND

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:19.088 region:rollup2
THEN?

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:20.256 region:rollup2
?

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.724 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE CALL I MEAN?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.659 region:rollup2
AGAIN I KNOWLEDGE IS A MASTER

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:25.061 region:rollup2
PLAN IS HOLDING GOING ON

01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:26.229 region:rollup2
PETROLEUM ARMS AROUND WHAT A I

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:27.096 region:rollup2
THINK THERE IS THE STATUS OF

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.264 region:rollup2
THEIR SUMMER MENTIONED ABOUT

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:30.833 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:31.734 region:rollup2
PER BED. IS THAT RIGHT SO IS

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.702 region:rollup2
ABOUT MY WOULD SIT I WOULD

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.070 region:rollup2
SUSPECT THAT SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.438 region:rollup2
TO THE LEVEL OF SKILL. THAT'S

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.839 region:rollup2
NEEDED YOU KNOW THAT INDEPENDENT

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:37.507 region:rollup2
LIVING ISN'T SEVENTY ONE GRAN

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.041 region:rollup2
ARE CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS SO SO

01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:39.609 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WHAT ENDS UP

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.476 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IS THERE'S THERE'S

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:42.612 region:rollup2
THERE'S COSTS.

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:43.713 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL COST OF CARE BASED ON

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:45.048 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF CARE IN YOUR MORE

01:09:43.713 --> 01:09:46.849 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT LEVELS CARE NOT AS

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:48.785 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE. AND YOUR HIGHER

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:51.120 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF CARE MORE EXPENSIVE SO

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:52.555 region:rollup2
ON READING ARE RC A FEE LEVEL OF

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.790 region:rollup2
CARES ABOUT A. HUNDRED NINETY

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.891 region:rollup2
FIVE DOLLARS A DAY IN THE

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.426 region:rollup2
SKILLED NURSING IN REDDING IS

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.360 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.028 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A DAY AND YOU CALCULATE

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.765 region:rollup2
THAT OUT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:05.234 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:08.104 region:rollup2
COST TO BE AN RC A FEW WHAT

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:11.140 region:rollup2
ACOSTA BE INNOCENT HAVE. NOW THE

01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:16.079 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS AS YOU KNOW BASED ON

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:19.015 region:rollup2
ON ON OUR. VETERANS KOBE SOME

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:23.119 region:rollup2
STATUTE ARE ARE REQUIRED PAPER

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:24.587 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME BASED

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:25.188 region:rollup2
UPON THE LEVEL OF CARE.

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:25.655 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO OFFSET WITH PER

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:27.156 region:rollup2
DIEM FROM THE FEDERAL

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.424 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:29.058 region:rollup2
AND THAT ESSENTIALLY GETS US TO

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:30.593 region:rollup2
A POINT WHERE THERE'S THERE'S A

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.928 region:rollup2
DELTA.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.495 region:rollup2
WHERE THE TAXPAYERS?

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.362 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.263 region:rollup2
GRACIOUSLY.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.864 region:rollup2
MADE UP THE DIFFERENCE

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.598 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:36.299 region:rollup2
DO IS.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.233 region:rollup2
OR TRY TO BE VERY FISCALLY

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:38.534 region:rollup2
PRUDENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.602 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE LOOKING.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.837 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS LAST BUDGET CYCLE

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.105 region:rollup2
WE INTRODUCED THE REQUIREMENT TO

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.539 region:rollup2
HAVE INSURANCE.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:45.208 region:rollup2
WILL HELP TO FOR COSTS OF CARE.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.743 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO IT WE INSERTED THE AT

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.610 region:rollup2
THE ADMISSIONS FOCUS ON THE ONES

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.444 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE SERVED THE MOUSE ARE

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.378 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE MOST SEVENTY

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.613 region:rollup2
PERCENTERS THEY GET ENHANCE PER

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.814 region:rollup2
DIEM OF ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:52.582 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A DAY SO YOU CAN SEE.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:54.016 region:rollup2
THE MORE SEVENTY PERCENTERS WE

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.184 region:rollup2
HAVE. A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.519 region:rollup2
DAYBED.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.887 region:rollup2
THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE SURE.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:59.889 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE WHERE WE'RE DOING

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:01.324 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STANDARD

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:03.526 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZE ACROSS ALL OF THE

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:05.394 region:rollup2
HOMES ARE IN CAPTURE MEDICARE

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:06.195 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR PARTY PARTY PARTY.

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:08.598 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:09.565 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN IN ENSURE THAT ALL OF

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.467 region:rollup2
OUR ELIGIBLE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:13.503 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AND.

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:14.470 region:rollup2
IN ATTENDANCE.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:16.205 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET THEM ENROLLED AND I

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:17.373 region:rollup2
THINK A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.941 region:rollup2
EFFORTS WILL GIVE US MUCH CLOSER

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:20.309 region:rollup2
TO WHAT THE SECRETARY WAS SAYING

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.978 region:rollup2
ONE IT SAID. SENATE COVERING ONE

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:24.147 region:rollup2
THIRD MAYBE WE CAN GET A LITTLE

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:26.182 region:rollup2
OVER HALF. A SOME STATES LIKE TO

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:28.217 region:rollup2
DO JUST SEVENTY PERCENT OR SOME

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:29.785 region:rollup2

SEVENTY PERCENT ARE ONLY STATE

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.633 region:rollup2

WAY. I'M I GUESS THAT CONCERNED

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:20.436 region:rollup2

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.854 region:rollup2
REALIZE THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAID

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.655 region:rollup2
THE CASE IN OTHER PLACES BUT.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:41.324 region:rollup2

MESSAGE TO SHARE.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.329 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.196 region:rollup2
GOOD AND REAL REASONS WHY THAT'S

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.064 region:rollup2
THE CASE BUT WE NEED TO FLIP

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.265 region:rollup2
THAT AROUND.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:50.066 region:rollup2
REALLY IN LIGHT OF HOMELESSNESS

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:51.834 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.635 region:rollup2

THEY'D THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.343 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:02.912 region:rollup2

HOMOSEXUAL AND MOVED BARSTOW.

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:08.184 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.185 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:10.720 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR OR

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:11.654 region:rollup2
THEY'D BE UTILIZED I READ THE

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.389 region:rollup2
MATERIALS UNDERSTAND THAT COMES

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:15.224 region:rollup2
A HIGHER LEVEL OF SKILL PUBLICLY

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:17.360 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY. ON BUT I'D LIKE TO

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:19.328 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS WHAT IT

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.396 region:rollup2
IS SIR I'M SORRY YET KNOW IT SON

THINGS THAT THAT THEY WERE PROUD

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.234 region:rollup2
TO SAY IS THAT THAT WE WENT BACK

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:27.503 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK. AT THE NUMBERS WE

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:29.038 region:rollup2
THE I BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:31.173 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF LAST YEAR'S

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:35.144 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS WHERE WERE HOMELESS

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:37.613 region:rollup2
VETERANS ACROSS ALL OF OUR

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:38.247 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOMES.

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.282 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU KNOW WITH THE TEACH

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.650 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOMAN WEST LA THAT'S NO

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.217 region:rollup2
LONGER OPERATING BUT WE WE GO

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.485 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUR WAY WE WE WERE

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:43.119 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY GETTING PHONE CALLS

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.120 region:rollup2
FROM FOLKS THAT SAY HEY WE HAVE

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.421 region:rollup2
A VET DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR

RIGHT NOW OUR BARSTOW AND AND I

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.892 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES.

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:51.060 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOUNTVILLE MOSTLY

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:52.662 region:rollup2
BARSTOW CHULA VISTA FOR SOME

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.830 region:rollup2
REASON IS IS CORNERED THE MARKET

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:55.698 region:rollup2
ON DOM NOT SO THERE'S NEVER BEDS

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.599 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE THERE BUT. WE DO

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.533 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE NUMBERS

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:00.569 region:rollup2
WILL GO DOWN IN THERE MAYBE.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:02.371 region:rollup2
A NEED TO REPURPOSE ALSO TAUGHT

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.973 region:rollup2
FOR HOMELESS WILL CERTAINLY TAKE

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:05.508 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT THAT PASSING TERMS OF

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.742 region:rollup2
BIHAC PARA ON THIS IS MY SOME OF

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.711 region:rollup2
MY PAST LIFE.

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:09.378 region:rollup2

COULD WORK CLOSELY WITH SOME

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:13.349 region:rollup2

YIELD UNITS.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:18.421 region:rollup2
AND A REVENUE STREAM QUITE

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:19.588 region:rollup2
FRANKLY I'M AND YOU KNOW WHY I

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:20.389 region:rollup2

YOU'RE HARD PRESSED TO MAKE THE

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.995 region:rollup2
CASE THAT THOSE ARE SOMEHOW MORE

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.397 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAN THE CARE OF OUR

.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:39.021 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SEE IS THE ACUTE

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:40.789 region:rollup2
SHORTCOMINGS THAT WERE RAISED BY

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:43.759 region:rollup2
THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ON

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:46.395 region:rollup2

WELL I I I THINK IT.

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:51.800 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO PUT THAT QUESTION

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.269 region:rollup2
WHAT SHORTCOMINGS TO THE LITTLE

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.638 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION BREAKPOINT TO

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:57.606 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN. THE COMMISSION

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:59.475 region:rollup2
SHORTCOMINGS THAT AFFECTS AYE

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:03.979 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH. YEAH THEY HAVE THEIR

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:07.583 region:rollup2
OWN BUT.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:11.887 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WANNA DAY IDENTIFY

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:12.888 region:rollup2
THAT TODAY YEAH I. THINK YEAH.

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.088 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE FIRST OF ALL I THINK

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.024 region:rollup2
THEY?

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:16.792 region:rollup2
THEY ENCOURAGED US TO OF.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:18.594 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:21.130 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY LOOK AT PARTNERSHIPS

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:23.799 region:rollup2
IN THE ARM PRIVATE WORLD IN THE

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:25.200 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT WORLD TO HELP US SO WE

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:27.603 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE EXPERTISE IN THAT.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.138 region:rollup2
THING THAT THEY REALIZE THAT

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.272 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.340 region:rollup2
HOMELESS WAS.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.475 region:rollup2
ANTIQUATED AND.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.511 region:rollup2
THE LIVERY OF MEDICAL CARE WAS

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:37.246 region:rollup2
NOT EFFICIENT THERE IN ALMOST

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:40.115 region:rollup2
HELPED POINT THE DIRECTION

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:41.684 region:rollup2
TOWARD A NEW FACILITY FOR ME.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.850 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:43.552 region:rollup2
AND.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.820 region:rollup2
.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.989 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:49.725 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:51.493 region:rollup2
PERIODICALLY STUDYING EVERY HOME

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:53.596 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT THIS LEGISLATION

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:55.631 region:rollup2
ON THE HOME SPECIFIC MASTER PLAN

01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:56.565 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO DO.

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:59.268 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ALSO.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:19:01.870 region:rollup2
.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:03.405 region:rollup2
NOT THE.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.707 region:rollup2
IT'S SHORT ALL OF THEIR FINDINGS

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.742 region:rollup2
WERE THINGS THAT WE EITHER

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:08.210 region:rollup2
SUSPECTED OR HAD ALREADY STARTED

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.711 region:rollup2
DUBBED WORKING ON AND WERE

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:15.417 region:rollup2
ALMOST RELIEF TO BUT THE

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:18.988 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GOING

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:20.589 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE. ARM IN FIVE YEARS.

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:23.692 region:rollup2
EVERY WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN WILL

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.327 region:rollup2
BE A HUNDRED YEARS OR OLDER.

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:26.962 region:rollup2
IN TEN YEARS EVERY KOREAN WHERE

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:28.530 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE NINETY YEARS OLD OR

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:30.699 region:rollup2
OLDER.

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.734 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:33.335 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT ARE THEN

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:34.937 region:rollup2
GOING TO START COMING JUST TEN

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:36.905 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM NOW. BY THIS MAN

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:39.108 region:rollup2
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF VIETNAM

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:41.877 region:rollup2
VETERANS BUT I THINK AT THE SAME

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:43.779 region:rollup2
TIME MEDICAL SCIENCE.

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:46.415 region:rollup2
WHICH I FOLLOW IT MAY BE MORE

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:48.150 region:rollup2
CLOSELY THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:49.518 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE KINDS OF

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:51.120 region:rollup2
INJURIES THAT THE YOUNG MEN AND

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:53.155 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE SO STAYING IN THE IRAQ

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.723 region:rollup2
WAR I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:56.358 region:rollup2
TO WAIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY COMING

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:57.960 region:rollup2
AT US.

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:59.762 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE YOUNG FOLKS ARE

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.297 region:rollup2
SUSTAINING BRAIN INJURIES.

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:04.533 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:06.035 region:rollup2
ENCEPHALITIS THAT THESE AND UP

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:07.302 region:rollup2
BUT FORGET THE MENTAL HEALTH AT

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:08.370 region:rollup2
THE.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:10.005 region:rollup2
POSTER MATIC STRESS JUST THE

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.740 region:rollup2
ORGANIC INJURIES ARE GOING TO

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:13.876 region:rollup2
PRESENT WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.144 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND TO OUTRIGHT DEMENTIA

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:15.978 region:rollup2
IN NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE NOT

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:18.147 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:21.583 region:rollup2
.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:23.786 region:rollup2
SO IT IT ASKING US TO LOOK AT

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:26.055 region:rollup2
WHAT'S COMING. WE'RE WE'RE

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:28.157 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A WAY FOR THAT IS.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:29.258 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY SCARY TO BEHOLD.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:31.293 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THE FEDERAL

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:34.163 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT OR ANY STATE IS GOING

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:35.397 region:rollup2
TO PREPARED BE PREPARD TO DO.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.965 region:rollup2
THE BEST JOB IT WISHED IT COULD

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:38.200 region:rollup2
DO.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:39.968 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:44.273 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE WHAT

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:47.076 region:rollup2
IS THE BEST WE CAN DO IT ALL.

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:48.877 region:rollup2
TO. HIM BASED ON THAT WE HAD A

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:50.279 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN I GUESS THAT YOU HAD

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:51.580 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND. ARE

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:52.815 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.850 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S SIX YEARS OLD.

01:20:52.815 --> 01:20:56.118 region:rollup2
TIMES OF CHANGED.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.086 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OF THAT MASTER PLAN OR

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:59.388 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE IF AT

01:20:57.086 --> 01:21:03.225 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:03.425 region:rollup2
AND WHILE. MOST OF WHAT YOU KNOW

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.460 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.060 region:rollup2
.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.728 region:rollup2
WHO DO YOU HAVE WORKING ON IT

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.929 region:rollup2
NOW?

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:09.765 region:rollup2
AND DO THEY HAVE THE SKILL SET

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:12.768 region:rollup2
TO TO CONTINUE. AND ADAPT TO THE

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:15.504 region:rollup2
LITTLE OVER PLANS THAT.

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:17.339 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT WITH A DEPUTY A GERARD

01:21:15.504 --> 01:21:19.208 region:rollup2
HERE I THINK COMMISSION PEPTO

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:20.609 region:rollup2
MISTER PLANNING TO THOUSAND

WHATEVER START.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:26.081 region:rollup2
SO THE ORIGINAL MASTER PLAN WAS

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.515 region:rollup2
CREATED FOR A VARIETY OF

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:29.451 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:31.653 region:rollup2
IT WAS CREATED TO TAKE ALL OF A

LONGER. TERM LOOK AT WHAT WE

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:34.656 region:rollup2
MIGHT DO WITH THE PROPERTY

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:35.791 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROCESS CALLED THE

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:37.826 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY.

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:40.162 region:rollup2
PLAN WITHIN THE STATE BUDGET

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:41.663 region:rollup2
CYCLE AND. WHAT WE WERE DOING AT

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:44.199 region:rollup2
THE TIME WORK JUST BANDAID

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:44.800 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO SIMPLE

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:48.470 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE DID MAINTENANCE

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.439 region:rollup2
A?

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.540 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE HOME WE

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:53.142 region:rollup2
NEEDED A BROADER.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.610 region:rollup2
VIEW OF THINGS AND SO WHAT WE

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:56.945 region:rollup2
DID WAS WE WENT OUT AND HIRED A.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.913 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURAL FIRM THAT HAD

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:59.615 region:rollup2
LONG TERM CARE.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:01.216 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:03.852 region:rollup2
AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE BUILDING

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:05.220 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE I WE HIRED FOLKS FROM.

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:06.922 region:rollup2
GENERAL SERVICES IN THE REAL

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.523 region:rollup2
ESTATE WORLD TECH.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:10.993 region:rollup2
TO HELP US COME UP WITH SOME

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:12.828 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUAL IDEAS SO THAT. WE HAD

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:14.696 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO.

01:22:12.828 --> 01:22:18.500 region:rollup2
TO REFER BACK TO WHEN IT CAME TO

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:18.901 region:rollup2
OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.069 region:rollup2
SNIFFED BUILDING.

01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:22.337 region:rollup2
COINCIDENTALLY.

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
WAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BASED

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.206 region:rollup2
ON THE CONDITIONS OF HOLDER

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:26.175 region:rollup2
MEANT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:28.076 region:rollup2
ELEVEN.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:29.711 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S NOT. UNREASONABLE TO

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:30.913 region:rollup2
THINK THAT TODAY WE HAVE THE

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:33.048 region:rollup2
SAME PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:35.918 region:rollup2
PUTTING MONEY INTO IT.

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:38.654 region:rollup2
HAND OVER FIST AND WHILE WE'RE

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:40.722 region:rollup2
STAYING UP WATER THE THE YOU

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:41.590 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE STANDARD OF. CARE

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:43.992 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:45.494 region:rollup2
A ROOM IS NOT ADEQUATE.

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:47.729 region:rollup2
SO THERE WERE A VARIETY OF OF

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:49.565 region:rollup2
REASONS OF WHY WE DID THAT.

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:51.400 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CONCEPTUAL IDEAS

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:53.035 region:rollup2
ABOUT USING PUBLIC.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.003 region:rollup2
ENTITIES TO HELP US WITH THE

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:57.573 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE FACT

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:59.174 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE BUDGET PROCESSES

01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:01.643 region:rollup2
IS IS CUMBERSOME INCIDENTS.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:04.279 region:rollup2
THERE'S EVALUATION OF LEASES

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:04.980 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.715 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME IS.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.651 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:11.186 region:rollup2
AS MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:12.955 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:14.857 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE'S AUTHORITY ALLOWS

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:16.925 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE TALKED WE'VE MADE FOR.

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:18.093 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN EIGHTY A WE'VE.

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:20.028 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.996 region:rollup2
FAIR MARKET VALUE WHEN IT'S

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:23.432 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:26.068 region:rollup2
WE'VE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:26.301 region:rollup2
ADJACENCY. BUILDING.

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:27.503 region:rollup2
WE'VE.

.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:30.138 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:33.242 region:rollup2

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:37.546 region:rollup2
RESOLVER REDUCE COSTS IN JUST A

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.448 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:05.406 region:rollup2
COME TO A CONCLUSION AS TO

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:07.041 region:rollup2
WHAT'S FAIR INVEST FOR FOR

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.142 region:rollup2

SOMETIMES.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:10.812 region:rollup2
HAVING.

01:34:10.278 --> 01:34:12.747 region:rollup2
THE OCCUPANTS WITHIN OUR

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:14.149 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS.

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:15.817 region:rollup2
VACANT BUILDINGS JUST KEEP THEM

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:17.352 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL ON THAT ACTUALLY IS

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:19.154 region:rollup2
A PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TYPE

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:19.754 region:rollup2
OF THING AS WELL SO SOMETIMES WE

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:20.822 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY ITSELF AS

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:22.490 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.591 region:rollup2
SO YOU WOULD SAY THERE'S NO

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.026 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT YOU'RE

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:26.928 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THESE WERE FAIR AT

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:28.429 region:rollup2
THE TIME THAT THEY WERE.

01:34:26.928 --> 01:34:29.597 region:rollup2
PUT INTO PLACE OR THAT THERE

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:32.233 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO BE

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:34.202 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:35.436 region:rollup2
THEY HAD. DONE WHAT I WOULD SAY

01:34:34.202 --> 01:34:36.871 region:rollup2
IS THEY REPRESENT THE

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:39.974 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DAY

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:41.910 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE THE THE THE BUDGET

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:43.945 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS AND OBLIGATE

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:45.613 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S MORE INFLUENCE THAT

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:47.382 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PERHAPS CECA A HIGHER

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:48.850 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF REVENUE SOMETIMES THE

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:51.286 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL PRESSURE SHIPS IN THE

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.287 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE DIRECTION. TO WHERE

01:34:51.286 --> 01:34:53.888 region:rollup2
PERHAPS.

01:34:52.287 --> 01:34:56.791 region:rollup2
THOUGH LEASE SEE.

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:58.459 region:rollup2

IT'S MORE IN LINE WITH OUR OUR

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:02.030 region:rollup2

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:27.628 region:rollup2
FUTURE POPULATION.

01:39:26.828 --> 01:39:29.730 region:rollup2

NOT BUT THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:59.540 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS BUT THE STATE

01:42:58.005 --> 01:43:01.075 region:rollup2
RECEIVES DOES VERY BY THE LEVEL

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:03.244 region:rollup2
OF CARE VETERANS ARE RECEIVING

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:06.847 region:rollup2
IN THE HOMES. AND ALSO A

VETERANS DISABILITY STATUS.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:11.385 region:rollup2
NEXT WITH REGARDS TO CAPACITY

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:12.987 region:rollup2
I'M BASED OFF OF THE MOST RECENT

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:16.023 region:rollup2
DATA WE WERE ABLE TAX.

01:43:12.987 --> 01:43:17.458 region:rollup2
VERIFY THAT THE FIGURE IN OUR

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:19.393 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WAS HANDED OUT ON

01:43:17.458 --> 01:43:21.762 region:rollup2
PAGE FIFTEEN FIGURE TEN THAT

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:23.964 region:rollup2
SHOWS THE I'M CAPACITY IN

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:25.800 region:rollup2
COMPARISON TO THE WAIT LIST IS

01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:27.501 region:rollup2
STILL I'M ACCURATE.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.070 region:rollup2
MEANING THAT BASED ON RECENT

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:30.871 region:rollup2
DATA WE SEE THAT DEMAND HASN'T

01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:32.473 region:rollup2
CHANGED MUCH SINCE WE PUBLISHED

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:34.341 region:rollup2
OUR REPORT AND WE SEE THAT

01:43:32.473 --> 01:43:35.643 region:rollup2
ACROSS ALL HOMES.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:37.445 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOWER

01:43:35.643 --> 01:43:38.979 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF CARE SUCH AS DOMUS

01:43:37.445 --> 01:43:41.315 region:rollup2
SILLERY OR INDEPENDENT LIVING

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:43.651 region:rollup2
FACILITIES FOR THE MOST PART.

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:44.819 region:rollup2
DEMAND OR PEOPLE ON THE WAIT

01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:46.053 region:rollup2
LIST THERE'S.

01:43:44.819 --> 01:43:47.388 region:rollup2
IT IT SEEMS TO LINE WITH

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.356 region:rollup2
CURRENT CAPACITY WITHIN THE

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:51.092 region:rollup2
HOMES HOWEVER THERE IS A HIGH

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:52.693 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF UNMET DEMAND FOR

01:43:51.092 --> 01:43:54.862 region:rollup2
SKILLED NURSING AND MEMORY CARE

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:56.997 region:rollup2
BATS.

01:43:54.862 --> 01:43:59.133 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT ON A

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:59.667 region:rollup2
PER HOME BASE AS CAPACITY IN

01:43:59.133 --> 01:44:01.769 region:rollup2
DEMAND DOES VERY WITH SOME

01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:02.937 region:rollup2
HOMES.

01:44:01.769 --> 01:44:04.371 region:rollup2
I'M NOT BEING ABLE TO CUT

01:44:02.937 --> 01:44:05.639 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THAT THE CURRENT

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:07.808 region:rollup2
DEMAND THAT THEY HAVE FOR

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:09.076 region:rollup2
DOMICILIARY PADS AND ALSO OTHER

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:12.413 region:rollup2
HOMES HAVING BEING GET PADS

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:14.348 region:rollup2
ACROSS VARIOUS LEVELS OF CARE.

01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:15.850 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION IN THE REPORT WE

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:17.451 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THAT.

01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:19.186 region:rollup2
IN THIS LARGER CONVERSATION OF

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:21.355 region:rollup2
CAPACITY WHILE BASIC MENTAL

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:22.990 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:24.091 region:rollup2
THE HOMES CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:26.193 region:rollup2
THE CAPACITY TO TAKE IN

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:29.597 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WITH COMPLEX AND

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:31.799 region:rollup2
MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:33.667 region:rollup2
MOVING ON FROM CAPACITY IN THE

01:44:31.799 --> 01:44:35.102 region:rollup2
REPORT WE ALSO REACHED RAISED A

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:37.037 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ISSUES.

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:38.806 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:40.141 region:rollup2
AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE

01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:41.642 region:rollup2
THAT DELIVER AT THE SERVICE

01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:42.977 region:rollup2
DELIVERY WITHIN THE HOMES AND AS

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:45.079 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:44:42.977 --> 01:44:46.413 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROCESS SOME OF

01:44:45.079 --> 01:44:47.748 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES WERE WERE ADDRESSED

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:49.884 region:rollup2
THROUGH LEGISLATION.

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:51.118 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY ONE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:53.521 region:rollup2
A LONG TERM FASTER PLAN FOR THE

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:55.589 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOMES. IN WHICH CALVET

01:44:53.521 --> 01:44:56.657 region:rollup2
WILL ASSESS THE FUTURE LONG TERM

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:59.059 region:rollup2
CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN

01:44:56.657 --> 01:45:00.728 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND POTENTIAL DEMAND.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:02.663 region:rollup2
I'M FOR VETERANS HOMES IN HOPES

01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:04.298 region:rollup2
THAT BASED OFF OF THESE FINDINGS

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:05.866 region:rollup2
OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WE WOULD

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:07.601 region:rollup2
BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO THINK

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:09.904 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO ADOPT THE VETERAN

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:11.872 region:rollup2
HOMES SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD TO

01:45:09.904 --> 01:45:13.307 region:rollup2
MEET FUTURE DEMAND.

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:14.308 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION ANOTHER CHANGE THAT

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:16.443 region:rollup2
CAME THROUGH BUDGET RELATED

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.478 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WAS A PRIORITIZATION

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:17.945 region:rollup2
OF VETERANS WITH HIGHER

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:20.214 region:rollup2
DISABILITY LEVELS FOR

01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:21.682 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS.

01:45:20.214 --> 01:45:23.450 region:rollup2
THESE VETERANS TYPICALLY RECEIVE

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:24.952 region:rollup2
HIGHER FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:26.353 region:rollup2
FOR THE COST OF CARE WHICH COULD

01:45:24.952 --> 01:45:28.322 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY RESULT IN GENERAL

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:30.124 region:rollup2
FUND SAVINGS IN FUTURE YEARS.

01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:31.058 region:rollup2
AS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN

01:45:30.124 --> 01:45:32.293 region:rollup2
CALVET WAS TASKED TO ASSESS

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:33.828 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TRADEOFFS IN

PRELIMINARY PLANS THAT WOULD

01:46:30.985 --> 01:46:34.989 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT A SKILLED NURSING AND

COUNTERPARTS IT SO ARE. AND. A

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.690 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POPULATION TO SERVE IN

01:50:29.523 --> 01:50:31.158 region:rollup2
THE.

01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:34.228 region:rollup2
.

01:50:31.158 --> 01:50:36.330 region:rollup2
A. OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED

01:50:34.228 --> 01:50:38.565 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE RUN. A SEVERAL

01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:39.533 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FACILITIES

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:41.235 region:rollup2
AND PERMITS MORE HOUSING FOR

01:50:39.533 --> 01:50:42.436 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TRADITIONAL FACILITY

01:50:41.235 --> 01:50:43.570 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES THAT

01:50:42.436 --> 01:50:45.739 region:rollup2
WERE USED.

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:48.008 region:rollup2
TO BRING FOLKS IN OFF THE STREET

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:49.810 region:rollup2
ALL OUR FOLKS ARE FORMER OR WERE

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:51.912 region:rollup2
HOMELESS TOOK TO COME IN.

01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:53.447 region:rollup2
NOT ORIGINALLY WERE IN BARRACKS

01:50:51.912 --> 01:50:56.083 region:rollup2
LIKE ENVIRONMENTS

01:50:53.447 --> 01:50:58.085 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND OF MULTIPLE BED

01:50:56.083 --> 01:51:00.921 region:rollup2
UNITS BEDROOMS.

01:50:58.085 --> 01:51:02.523 region:rollup2
HARD TO SERVE UP THAT WOMEN'S

01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:03.590 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND SO BENNETT AND

01:51:02.523 --> 01:51:05.626 region:rollup2
TAKES TIME TO BUILD THAT

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:07.361 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:51:05.626 --> 01:51:08.162 region:rollup2
SERB THAT POPULATION WERE DOING

01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:10.164 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:11.532 region:rollup2
BUT FRANKLY WE'RE.

01:51:10.164 --> 01:51:11.832 region:rollup2
WERE BEHIND THE CURVE THE CURVE

01:51:11.532 --> 01:51:13.734 region:rollup2
IN DOING IT.

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:15.702 region:rollup2
.

01:51:13.734 --> 01:51:17.538 region:rollup2
THE.

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:19.940 region:rollup2
IN. IRONICALLY IN ONE OF OUR

01:51:17.538 --> 01:51:22.709 region:rollup2
FACILITIES IN YOUR REFILL WE

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:24.711 region:rollup2
BUILT A A A. NEW FACILITY

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:26.980 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY DEDICATED

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:28.181 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR WOMEN.

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:30.651 region:rollup2
THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY OCCUPIED

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:33.487 region:rollup2
BY TRANSSEXUAL MEN.

01:51:30.651 --> 01:51:34.354 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE WAS NO PLACE.

01:51:33.487 --> 01:51:36.757 region:rollup2
FOR THE WOMEN.

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:38.625 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IN A CHANGING

01:51:36.757 --> 01:51:40.260 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT CHANGING POPULATION

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:42.062 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ALL HAVING TO COPE

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.630 region:rollup2
WITH IT TAKES RESOURCES.

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:46.633 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD URGE.

THEIR NEED WILL INCREASE THEIR

01:53:55.896 --> 01:53:58.565 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS WILL INCREASE AND

01:53:56.496 --> 01:54:00.267 region:rollup2

AND.

01:55:30.624 --> 01:55:34.895 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:55:32.993 --> 01:55:36.730 region:rollup2

BEING JOBS FOR THE FUTURE.

02:01:38.725 --> 02:01:41.661 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

LOU HOOVER COMMISSION HAS

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:43.696 region:rollup2
STARTED TOTHE PEAK UNDER THE

INTELLIGENCE.

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:49.335 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF WHAT WE ARE ASKING

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:50.170 region:rollup2
IS HOW DO WE APPLY ARTIFICIAL

02:01:49.335 --> 02:01:51.738 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND HOW DO WE

02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:53.506 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE JOB TRAINING NEEDS IN

02:01:51.738 --> 02:01:55.241 region:rollup2

DOING THAT KIND OF PLANNING ARE

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:05.251 region:rollup2
LOOKING INTO REVIEW MER AND ARE

02:02:03.483 --> 02:02:08.721 region:rollup2
NOT LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD.

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:09.522 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD BE A A A TRAVESTY.

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.623 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT INVESTING

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:12.125 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:13.459 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING JOB TRAINING

02:02:12.125 --> 02:02:14.761 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:16.162 region:rollup2
DESPERATELY NEED IT WHEN THERE

02:02:14.761 --> 02:02:17.664 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN THE WORK DONE

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:19.065 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

02:02:17.664 --> 02:02:20.733 region:rollup2
THEY GET THROUGH THE TRAINING.

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:21.734 region:rollup2
THERE'S A JOB THERE FOR THEM. WE

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:23.469 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO TRAIN THEM FOR

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:24.037 region:rollup2
JOBS ARE GOING TO DISAPPEAR AND

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:25.605 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL THAT'S

02:02:24.037 --> 02:02:26.372 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO. BUT AS

02:02:25.605 --> 02:02:27.907 region:rollup2
IT RELATES TO THE.

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:29.842 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY PART OF

02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:31.077 region:rollup2
OUR REPORT BUT IT'S SOMETHING I

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:32.712 region:rollup2
THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:34.013 region:rollup2
HEALTH OF VETERANS AND WHAT'S

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:35.748 region:rollup2

IN THE FUTURE WITH EMPLOYMENT

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:40.119 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:41.421 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO BE ASKING?

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:43.423 region:rollup2
OURSELVES WE NEED BE ASKING

02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:45.258 region:rollup2
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT DATA.

02:02:43.423 --> 02:02:47.193 region:rollup2
IN EVERY KIND OF ENDEAVOR THAT

WE ENGAGE AND WE FIND IN LITTLE

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.494 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION AT ONE OF

TO REQUIRE COMPILATION OF DATA

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:05.812 region:rollup2
IN A FORM THAT ANYBODY CAN LOOK

02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:06.412 region:rollup2

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:50.723 region:rollup2
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM

02:03:49.289 --> 02:03:52.392 region:rollup2
I'D I'D I DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:53.026 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

02:03:52.392 --> 02:03:55.161 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THEN.

02:03:53.026 --> 02:03:56.829 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS ANY OF THIS THREE

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:57.230 region:rollup2
OF YOU COULD ANSWER I'VE BEEN

02:03:56.829 --> 02:03:59.198 region:rollup2
POLICE HERE THEY.

02:03:57.230 --> 02:04:00.433 region:rollup2
.

02:03:59.198 --> 02:04:02.568 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION OF A

02:04:00.433 --> 02:04:04.270 region:rollup2
REDUCING OR ELIMINATING

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:06.606 region:rollup2
DOMICILIARY AND.

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:08.574 region:rollup2
CARE. AND AND HOW DO WE DO THIS

02:04:06.606 --> 02:04:10.209 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ABANDONING OUR DUTY TO

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:11.144 region:rollup2
OUR VETS.

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.712 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WHAT.

02:04:11.144 --> 02:04:13.179 region:rollup2
.

02:04:12.712 --> 02:04:15.048 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MOVE IN THAT

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:16.649 region:rollup2
DIRECTION?

02:04:15.048 --> 02:04:18.718 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE SCARIEST

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:19.953 region:rollup2
STUBHUB THINGS AND ANYBODY. CAN

02:04:18.718 --> 02:04:21.487 region:rollup2
HEAR IS THAT WERE YOU KNOW GRANT

02:04:19.953 --> 02:04:22.322 region:rollup2
TAKE WAY HOME.

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:24.123 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT WOULD MAKE ME

02:04:22.322 --> 02:04:25.191 region:rollup2
NERVOUS BITE MY WIFE CALLED ME

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:27.894 region:rollup2
UP AND SAID GUESS WHAT THE HOUSE

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:28.461 region:rollup2
IS GONE. I I I WOULD BE VERY

02:04:27.894 --> 02:04:30.530 region:rollup2
UPSET AND ANXIOUS ABOUT ALL

02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:31.097 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:31.631 region:rollup2
NOW THAT I'VE DONE ANYTHING

02:04:31.097 --> 02:04:33.933 region:rollup2
WRONG I'M JUST SAYING IT.

02:04:31.631 --> 02:04:35.635 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:36.803 region:rollup2
SO PART OF PART OF WHAT WE'D A

02:04:35.635 --> 02:04:37.437 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT I THINK THE

02:04:36.803 --> 02:04:39.138 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO DO WITH A

02:04:37.437 --> 02:04:40.840 region:rollup2
NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:43.276 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ALSO ABOUT EDUCATING

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:46.346 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC IN THE VETERANS.

02:04:43.276 --> 02:04:48.014 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE AS AS WE'VE SEEN

02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:50.383 region:rollup2
ACOSTA BED OF HUNDRED SEVENTEEN

02:04:48.014 --> 02:04:52.018 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED.

02:04:50.383 --> 02:04:52.618 region:rollup2
YOU SAY THAT TO ANYBODY

02:04:52.018 --> 02:04:53.986 region:rollup2
UNDERGONE LIKE JUST GIVE ME A

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:55.621 region:rollup2
VOUCHER.

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:56.990 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT I CAN PROBABLY FIND ME

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:58.691 region:rollup2
PRETTY DECENT HOTEL ROOM ON A

02:04:56.990 --> 02:05:00.827 region:rollup2
CALLS FOR. A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN

02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:03.629 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:05:00.827 --> 02:05:05.431 region:rollup2
BUT IF WHAT YOU DO IS SAY. WE

02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:07.100 region:rollup2
CAN ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY BASED

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:08.134 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.236 region:rollup2
THAT DO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:05:08.134 --> 02:05:11.604 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:14.173 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH VETERANS AND

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:15.875 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SERVICES WE CAN DO THAT

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:18.845 region:rollup2
EITHER IN THEIR HOME. OR WE CAN

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:20.580 region:rollup2
DO THAT IN A FACILITY THAT IS.

02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:22.782 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY YOUR HOME BUT

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:24.784 region:rollup2
THEN AGAIN NOT A PERMANENT. BAD

02:05:22.782 --> 02:05:26.352 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEONE ALL THE TIME YOU CAN

02:05:24.784 --> 02:05:27.954 region:rollup2
GENERATE SOME OF THAT MONEY FROM

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:29.188 region:rollup2
IT RE VISITING. THROUGH THE

02:05:27.954 --> 02:05:30.656 region:rollup2
NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:32.291 region:rollup2
HOMES.

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:33.526 region:rollup2
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE HAVE

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:35.628 region:rollup2
TO BE CONSISTENT AND AND WE HAVE

02:05:33.526 --> 02:05:38.064 region:rollup2
TO.

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:39.098 region:rollup2
INSURE THAT VETERANS UNDERSTAND

02:05:38.064 --> 02:05:40.500 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE THE STATE OF

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:42.935 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL HONOR OUR

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.704 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE.

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:46.506 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE BETTER WAYS TO DO

02:05:44.704 --> 02:05:48.441 region:rollup2
IT IS TO LOOK THROUGH THE SYSTEM

02:05:46.506 --> 02:05:49.942 region:rollup2
FIND THE INEFFICIENCY SQUEEZE

02:05:48.441 --> 02:05:51.310 region:rollup2
THOSE OUT. AND THEN TAKE THE

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:53.012 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT YOU RECOVER.

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:54.580 region:rollup2
FROM THAT TO PUT IT INTO

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:56.082 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT ARE BETTER.

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:59.652 region:rollup2
APPLY TO VETERANS.

02:05:56.082 --> 02:06:01.020 region:rollup2
MAYBE IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:02.755 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE WOULD

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:04.257 region:rollup2
NOTICE WHILE IS THERE ARE

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:05.792 region:rollup2
VARIOUS WAYS IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:04.257 --> 02:06:06.392 region:rollup2
WERE CONSIDERING THAT TO DO IT

02:06:05.792 --> 02:06:08.261 region:rollup2
EACH WITH THEIR OWN TRADE OFF

02:06:06.392 --> 02:06:10.430 region:rollup2
SO.

02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:12.031 region:rollup2
ANY CONSIDERATION OF CHANGING

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:13.666 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MIX IN THE.

02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:15.301 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF CARE SERVICES PROVIDE

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:17.136 region:rollup2
IN THE VETERANS HOME WOULD HAVE

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:19.305 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE SOME INVESTIGATION OF

02:06:17.136 --> 02:06:21.374 region:rollup2
WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE. AND

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:24.143 region:rollup2
THEN IDENTIFYING ARE THERE WAYS

02:06:21.374 --> 02:06:26.746 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL UNMET

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:28.381 region:rollup2
NEED GIVEN JUST THE PROJECTION

02:06:26.746 --> 02:06:29.048 region:rollup2
OF FUTURE NEEDS AND RECOGNIZING

02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:30.983 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:06:29.048 --> 02:06:32.084 region:rollup2
AND ASSESSMENT TODAY OF FUTURE

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:35.121 region:rollup2
DEMAND.

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:36.622 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT REFLECT AN ASSESSMENT

02:06:35.121 --> 02:06:38.291 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DO FIVE YEARS FROM

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:40.326 region:rollup2
NOW JUST GIVEN THE THAT CHANGING

02:06:38.291 --> 02:06:43.196 region:rollup2
ON DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THE

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:44.263 region:rollup2
POPULATION AS WELL.

02:06:43.196 --> 02:06:46.332 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT IS

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:50.136 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIS INVENTORY OF HOMES

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:52.405 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE H. P..

02:06:50.136 --> 02:06:53.840 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PERMANENT.

02:06:52.405 --> 02:06:55.274 region:rollup2
ALL VERGE ALL OF THEM TO DATE

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.175 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN I'M ALMOST ALL OF THEM

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:58.177 region:rollup2
BEEN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:06:56.175 --> 02:07:02.582 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:06:58.177 --> 02:07:04.951 region:rollup2
ARM. AND A. HAS THAT INVENTORY

02:07:02.582 --> 02:07:08.321 region:rollup2
IT'S DEVELOPED.

02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:09.989 region:rollup2
ARE IT CAN ABSORB SOME OF THAT

02:07:08.321 --> 02:07:11.924 region:rollup2
DOM POPULATION.

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:14.560 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOWN POPULATION CAN

02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:17.063 region:rollup2
THEN BE TRANSFERRED.

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:18.664 region:rollup2
A. LOT TWO OTHER PURPORT

02:07:17.063 --> 02:07:19.632 region:rollup2
REPURPOSE FOR OTHER THANKS

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:22.001 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE THIS ARE

02:07:19.632 --> 02:07:23.970 region:rollup2
THEIR INVENTORY OF HOUSING

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:25.905 region:rollup2
LOCATED NEAR WERE PUT FOLKS ARE

02:07:23.970 --> 02:07:27.907 region:rollup2
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH V.

02:07:25.905 --> 02:07:29.475 region:rollup2
H. H. PRE. ELECTED NO PLACE LIKE

02:07:27.907 --> 02:07:31.210 region:rollup2
HOME FUNDING THAT'S COMING

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:35.181 region:rollup2
ONLINE HOPEFULLY.

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:36.949 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS WE CALIFORNIA

02:07:35.181 --> 02:07:38.551 region:rollup2
HAS MADE IT SUBSTANTIAL

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:39.986 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:07:38.551 --> 02:07:42.021 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE AWHILE FOR IT.

02:07:39.986 --> 02:07:44.857 region:rollup2
TO GET GET BUILT.

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:46.559 region:rollup2
A BUT IT CAN RELIEVE SOME OF THE

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:48.995 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THE DOM SPACE SO IT CAN

02:07:46.559 --> 02:07:50.062 region:rollup2
BE REPURPOSED FOR OTHER THINGS.

02:07:48.995 --> 02:07:52.265 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:54.867 region:rollup2
IS IN OUR REPORT REDUCED.

02:07:52.265 --> 02:07:56.235 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT DEPENDING ON THE

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:58.538 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:07:56.235 --> 02:08:02.008 region:rollup2
SETS OUT IN PARTICULARLY WHICH

02:07:58.538 --> 02:08:03.910 region:rollup2
VETERANS. WOULD YOU LIKE THE

02:08:02.008 --> 02:08:05.211 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOME SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON

02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:05.778 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE POTENTIALLY HOMELESS

02:08:05.211 --> 02:08:08.114 region:rollup2
VETERANS UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:08.781 region:rollup2
THEY.

02:08:08.114 --> 02:08:09.949 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST PROPORTIONALLY

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:11.751 region:rollup2
HOMELESS VETERANS TO HAVE A

02:08:09.949 --> 02:08:12.985 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL

02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:14.954 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:17.590 region:rollup2
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:08:14.954 --> 02:08:18.958 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF CARE.

02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:21.294 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GAP IN RESOURCES

02:08:18.958 --> 02:08:23.062 region:rollup2
THEY'RE. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:08:21.294 --> 02:08:24.363 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT IS THE CURRENT VALUE

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:25.698 region:rollup2
OF THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM FOR

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:27.233 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE MORE DIFFICULT

02:08:25.698 --> 02:08:28.267 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT JUST

02:08:27.233 --> 02:08:30.670 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY HAVE TROUBLE.

02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:33.139 region:rollup2
.

02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:35.441 region:rollup2

BUT THEN ALSO THERE HOUSING

STABILITY.

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.379 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KEY POINT IN TERMS OF

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:45.544 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT

02:09:44.944 --> 02:09:47.380 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS THAT COULD PRODUCE

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:49.415 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:50.716 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL THE ARROW.

02:09:49.415 --> 02:09:52.151 region:rollup2
WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:53.319 region:rollup2
PANEL AND IT THINK YOU VERY MUCH

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:54.887 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AYE

02:09:53.319 --> 02:09:56.555 region:rollup2
I AM.

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:57.857 region:rollup2
I REALIZED AYE IN ARTFULLY ASK

02:09:56.555 --> 02:09:59.425 region:rollup2
THAT THE QUESTION EARLIER OF THE

02:09:57.857 --> 02:10:00.993 region:rollup2
SECRETARY BECAUSE REALLY WHAT I

02:09:59.425 --> 02:10:01.961 region:rollup2
WAS TRYING TO GET TO ON ARE ALL

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:03.929 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE TALKED

02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:06.532 region:rollup2
ABOUT WITCHES.

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:08.868 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MENU OF OF

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:11.003 region:rollup2
NEEDS IN SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE

02:10:08.868 --> 02:10:12.705 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. AND THE QUESTION THEN

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:14.473 region:rollup2
BECOMES HOW DO YOU KIND OF

02:10:12.705 --> 02:10:17.343 region:rollup2
JUSTIFY WHERE YOU SPEND THE

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:19.011 region:rollup2
MONEY. ON IT NOT DETRACTING FROM

02:10:17.343 --> 02:10:21.614 region:rollup2
ANY PARTICULAR.

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:24.717 region:rollup2
INJURY HERE OR ON.

02:10:21.614 --> 02:10:25.418 region:rollup2
OR AT NEED BUT THERE'S LIMITED

02:10:24.717 --> 02:10:28.154 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND.

02:10:25.418 --> 02:10:29.055 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO THIS

02:10:28.154 --> 02:10:29.355 region:rollup2
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

02:10:29.055 --> 02:10:30.489 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

02:10:29.355 --> 02:10:32.458 region:rollup2
.

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:33.793 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE

02:10:32.458 --> 02:10:35.628 region:rollup2
LOW THAT'S THE REASON I ASKED.

02:10:33.793 --> 02:10:37.496 region:rollup2
ORDER OTHER STATES DOING ITS

02:10:35.628 --> 02:10:39.298 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

02:10:37.496 --> 02:10:40.900 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETIMES ON.

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:42.735 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HOW IT'S DONE

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.436 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE MAY BE UP ALESTRA

02:10:42.735 --> 02:10:46.539 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT BUT.

02:10:43.436 --> 02:10:47.840 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS.

02:10:46.539 --> 02:10:50.076 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT WE WANT TO

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.911 region:rollup2
TRY TO DO IS VERY VERY SIMILAR

02:10:50.076 --> 02:10:53.913 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE DO WITH SENIORS WHICH

02:10:51.911 --> 02:10:55.314 region:rollup2
IS TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE. IN

02:10:53.913 --> 02:10:56.882 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:58.184 region:rollup2
AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT

02:10:56.882 --> 02:10:59.118 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THEM WITH THE SERVICE.

02:10:58.184 --> 02:11:00.586 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICES THEY NEED AS

02:10:59.118 --> 02:11:02.722 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO BRINGING THEM OUT AND

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:04.557 region:rollup2
THEN RESUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:11:02.722 --> 02:11:07.226 region:rollup2
THE CARE. THAT MAY NOT BE KICKED

02:11:04.557 --> 02:11:09.628 region:rollup2
OUT POSSIBLE IN ALL INSTANCES

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:10.062 region:rollup2
BUT. ON IT IT UP THE MORE THAT

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:12.665 region:rollup2
WE CAN PROVIDE. THE

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:14.100 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES.

02:11:12.665 --> 02:11:15.368 region:rollup2
AND AND ONE OF THE AS

02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:15.534 region:rollup2
ALTERNATES FOR EXAMPLE MAY BE

02:11:15.368 --> 02:11:17.703 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:19.405 region:rollup2
.

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:21.474 region:rollup2
AT VETERANS THAT ARE DISABLED

02:11:19.405 --> 02:11:23.242 region:rollup2
HELPING THEM FIX THEIR HOME.

02:11:21.474 --> 02:11:25.578 region:rollup2
BOB WITH DISABILITY ACCESS

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:27.246 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN MANEUVER AROUND

02:11:25.578 --> 02:11:28.214 region:rollup2
THERE THEIR RESIDENTS GIVEN

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:29.682 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR RIGHT THERE

02:11:28.214 --> 02:11:31.417 region:rollup2
DISABILITY AND THAT. THAT

02:11:29.682 --> 02:11:32.752 region:rollup2
DOESN'T FALL VERY CLEANLY IN

02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:34.787 region:rollup2
WITHIN IT ANYTHING THAT WE'VE

02:11:32.752 --> 02:11:37.623 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT BUT. BUT HAVING

02:11:34.787 --> 02:11:39.391 region:rollup2
THOSE AS RESOURCES ON THIS MENU

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:42.094 region:rollup2
CHART MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND I'M

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:42.361 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT TIME. THAT THAT THAT

02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:44.063 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:45.398 region:rollup2
.

02:11:44.063 --> 02:11:46.565 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:11:45.398 --> 02:11:48.601 region:rollup2
TE REPORT THAT'S BEEN PREPARED

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:49.235 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:50.536 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS

02:11:49.235 --> 02:11:52.371 region:rollup2
KEEP.

02:11:50.536 --> 02:11:54.106 region:rollup2
KEEP PEOPLE ON GIVE PEOPLE

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:55.741 region:rollup2
SERVICES AT THE LOWEST COST BUT

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:58.177 region:rollup2
REALLY RESPECTING WHERE THEIR

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:59.044 region:rollup2
PLACES BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SURE

02:11:58.177 --> 02:12:00.579 region:rollup2
THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THE

02:11:59.044 --> 02:12:02.414 region:rollup2
HOMELESS BECAUSE THAT. THAT TO

02:12:00.579 --> 02:12:03.416 region:rollup2
ME IS IS ON.

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:05.217 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT IT'S THE MOST

02:12:03.416 --> 02:12:06.619 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIONABLE.

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:07.887 region:rollup2
AB.

02:12:06.619 --> 02:12:10.222 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE HAVE WHICH IS THAT

02:12:07.887 --> 02:12:11.223 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RETURN AND BECAUSE OF

02:12:10.222 --> 02:12:13.192 region:rollup2
THEIR. THEIR.

02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:14.727 region:rollup2
INJURIES ARE OUR PARTICULAR

02:12:13.192 --> 02:12:16.829 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY END UP ON THE

02:12:14.727 --> 02:12:18.297 region:rollup2
STREETS.

02:12:16.829 --> 02:12:20.566 region:rollup2
IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD FOR US.

02:12:18.297 --> 02:12:21.967 region:rollup2
AS A DEVELOPER IN COULD WE WOULD

02:12:20.566 --> 02:12:24.136 region:rollup2
DO MOSTLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:26.305 region:rollup2
IN RURAL AREAS.

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:28.407 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IT LAKE COUNTY FOR

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:29.441 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE COUNTY HAS OFFERED

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:31.844 region:rollup2
US FOR FREE.

02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:34.313 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN ACRES.

02:12:31.844 --> 02:12:35.381 region:rollup2
BUILD A AND WANT US TO BUILD

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:36.849 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS

02:12:35.381 --> 02:12:39.218 region:rollup2
VETS.

02:12:36.849 --> 02:12:40.453 region:rollup2
OUR PROBLEM IN MAKING THAT

02:12:39.218 --> 02:12:41.220 region:rollup2
PENCIL OUT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE

02:12:40.453 --> 02:12:43.122 region:rollup2
ANY ALLOCATED PROJECT BASED

02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:45.691 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS.

02:12:43.122 --> 02:12:48.427 region:rollup2
THEY FAIR MARKET RENTS.

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:49.361 region:rollup2
AND LIKE COUNTY OR SO LOW.

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:51.864 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T MAKE THE FINANCING

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:55.467 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:12:51.864 --> 02:12:57.870 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S.

02:12:55.467 --> 02:13:00.472 region:rollup2
IT'S TOUGH IN THOSE RURAL AREAS

02:12:57.870 --> 02:13:01.874 region:rollup2
ARM AND OFTEN.

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:03.676 region:rollup2
THEY'RE.

02:13:01.874 --> 02:13:05.945 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE DOING TO FACILITY

02:13:03.676 --> 02:13:07.580 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF SHASTA LAKE JUST

02:13:05.945 --> 02:13:09.315 region:rollup2
NORTH OF READING.

02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.183 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLY THIRTY UNITS AND WE

02:13:09.315 --> 02:13:13.686 region:rollup2
TRIED TO FIND PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:13:11.183 --> 02:13:15.488 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT DEVELOPERS.

02:13:13.686 --> 02:13:17.189 region:rollup2
AND NINE WOULD DEVELOP.

02:13:15.488 --> 02:13:18.357 region:rollup2
PARTNER WITH US BECAUSE THERE

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:20.559 region:rollup2
WAS ENOUGH RETURN OUT OF A

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:22.194 region:rollup2
THIRTY UNIT PROJECT.

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:23.863 region:rollup2
JEFF WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO COBBLE

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:25.130 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

02:13:23.863 --> 02:13:26.799 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES DO WITHOUT A TAX

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:28.200 region:rollup2
CREDIT FINANCING.

02:13:26.799 --> 02:13:29.969 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING YOU CAN'T

GET TAX GRANT FUNDING FOR

02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:31.904 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WE'VE

02:13:30.503 --> 02:13:32.705 region:rollup2
GOTTA.

02:13:31.904 --> 02:13:34.440 region:rollup2
COBBLE TOGETHER BIG THAT MUCH

02:13:32.705 --> 02:13:35.741 region:rollup2
HARDER FOR THAT IMPORTANT

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:39.144 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:39.645 region:rollup2
OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE.

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:42.047 region:rollup2
HAN.

02:13:39.645 --> 02:13:43.816 region:rollup2
BUT I YOU CAN'T USE AFFORDABLE

MEMBER YOUR YOUR READ YOUR.

02:14:07.306 --> 02:14:09.808 region:rollup2
YOUR IDEA ABOUT.

02:14:09.275 --> 02:14:11.010 region:rollup2
IF THE IF THE HOME ISN'T

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:12.711 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE.

02:14:11.010 --> 02:14:14.580 region:rollup2
THEN INSTEAD OF SPENDING HUNDRED

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:16.048 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.016 region:rollup2
PICK A PERSON UP AND MOVE THEM

02:14:16.048 --> 02:14:17.583 region:rollup2
INTO A. A STATE.

OPERATE AT HOME.

02:14:17.583 --> 02:14:20.152 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:14:19.151 --> 02:14:22.254 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:22.821 region:rollup2
REEVALUATION AND RE PURPOSING IS

02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:24.189 region:rollup2
A WORD THAT WE'VE BEEN USING

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:25.457 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:26.926 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE HOMES.

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:28.761 region:rollup2
AND TAKING THE REVENUES.

02:14:26.926 --> 02:14:29.328 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE SAVED THAN I THAT

02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:30.329 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES ABSOLUTE PERFECT

02:14:29.328 --> 02:14:31.764 region:rollup2
SENSE.

02:14:30.329 --> 02:14:32.498 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO EMPOWER SOMEONE TO

02:14:31.764 --> 02:14:33.632 region:rollup2
REMAIN IN THEIR HOME IN THEIR

02:14:32.498 --> 02:14:34.533 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. AND IT'S CHEAPER TO

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:36.168 region:rollup2
BRING SOMEONE IN TO PROVIDE THE

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:38.203 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO THEM HOME THAN TO

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:40.139 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM IN A STATE.

02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:41.140 region:rollup2
RUN HOME NOW THERE THERE THERE

02:14:40.139 --> 02:14:42.608 region:rollup2
WILL BE THOSE VETERANS THAT HAVE

02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:44.710 region:rollup2
TO HAVE.

02:14:42.608 --> 02:14:46.845 region:rollup2
THAT INTENSIVE CARE.

02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:47.379 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE UP IN

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:49.315 region:rollup2
FACILITIES OPERATED BY THE

02:14:47.379 --> 02:14:51.083 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:14:49.315 --> 02:14:53.285 region:rollup2
I BUT I DO THINK AND I'M AND I'M

02:14:51.083 --> 02:14:55.754 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC AND I THINK IT'S WISE

02:14:53.285 --> 02:14:57.489 region:rollup2
FOR THIS THIS COMMITTEE. TO

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:59.658 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ASK THE SECRETARY.

02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:01.593 region:rollup2
FOR UPDATES SO THAT THOSE KINDS

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:03.295 region:rollup2
OF PERSPECTIVES ARE REFLECTED IN

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:05.164 region:rollup2
THE MATRIX OF THE DECISION

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:07.099 region:rollup2
MAKING THAT IF IT IS IT IS ONCE

02:15:05.164 --> 02:15:10.002 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT

02:15:07.099 --> 02:15:11.537 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT. AND IF IF

02:15:10.002 --> 02:15:14.306 region:rollup2
IF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE

02:15:11.537 --> 02:15:15.841 region:rollup2
IGNORED IN THE EVALUATION THEN

02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:17.576 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REALLY MISSING A PART OF

02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:19.011 region:rollup2
HOW YOU CAN USE MONIES.

02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:20.279 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO PUT A GRAB BAR IN

02:15:19.011 --> 02:15:21.780 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S PLACE TO DO THE RAMP

02:15:20.279 --> 02:15:23.415 region:rollup2
TO GET UP TO THE HOUSE TO OPEN

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.617 region:rollup2
UP THE DOORWAYS TO MAYBE CHANGE

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:26.318 region:rollup2
THE HEIGHT OF THE SINKS IN THE

02:15:24.617 --> 02:15:27.853 region:rollup2
BATHROOMS. WHICH ARE

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:32.157 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE
