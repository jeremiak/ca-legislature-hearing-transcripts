TWO SEVENTY SIX THE BILL THAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITY IS ART SO COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING THE LARGEST. NUMBER OF MEASLES AND FACTIONS AND OVER A QUARTER CENTURY. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX MAINTAINS AND RESTORES THE INTEGRITY OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS SYSTEM TO LEGALLY REQUIRED VACCINES FOR SCHOOL ROLE MEANT. NOW I THANK YOU CHAIR WORDS IN YOUR STAFF -- FOR YOUR WORK ON THE BILL AND I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN HIS OFFICE PARTICULARLY SECRETARY HAVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GOLLY WHO WORKED CLOSELY WITH BOTH. THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF AND MYSELF TO CRAFT THE CALIFORNIA SOLUTION TO ENSURING THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN WHO TRULY REQUIRE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL. GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS A CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND I APPRECIATE HIS COMMITMENT TO SIGN SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AFTER IS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX ENSURES THAT STUDENTS WHO TRULY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WILL RECEIVE THE EXEMPTION. WHILE KEEPING THE SAME CHILDREN SAFE AT SCHOOL BY ENSURING THERE IS COMMUNITY IMMUNITY. THIS BILL PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF THESE CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE FREEDOM. THE FREEDOM TO GO ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING AT RISK OF BEING INFECTED WITH SERIOUS PREVENTABLE DISEASES. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN OVER A THOUSAND ACTUALLY THOUSAND FORTY FOUR REPORTED CASES OF MEASLES AND UNITED STATES THIS YEAR THIS IS THE MOST NUMBER SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND CERTAINLY SINCE MEASLES THE CLEAR ELIMINATED IN THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND THIS YEAR DEVON OUTBREAKS WITH FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX CASES IN NEW YORK CITY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE IN ROCKLAND COUNTY NEW YORK. EIGHTY ONE IN WASHINGTON STATE AND NUMEROUS OTHER STATES AS WELL. AND ALL THESE OUTBREAKS HAVE SPREADING COMMUNITIES WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'D BEEN FIFTY TWO MEASLES CASES INCLUDING MULTIPLE CASES OF COME THROUGH ALLEY ACTS. MANY OF WHICH INVOLVE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE CATCHING MEASLES OVERSEAS AND RETURNING CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISEASE AND THERE'S STILL AN ONGOING OUTBREAK IN BUTTE COUNTY. NOW IS REPORT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE WELL MEASLES HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THIS YEAR UNLIKE OTHER STATES. WE HAVE NOT SUFFERED A LARGE OUTBREAK LIKE THOSE WE SEEN IN OTHER STATES. LIKE THE WHAT AND LIKE THE ONE WE SAW ACTUALLY HERE IN DISNEYLAND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK ACTION BY PASSING SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN TO RESTORE COMMUNITY TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING STATE VACCINATION RATES FOR EACH OF THE INTERNET GOT ENTERING KINDERGARTEN CLASS ABOVE 90% AFTER ITS IMPLEMENTATION ENOUGH TO BEGAN RESTORING COMMUNITY. BUT THIS PROTECTION IS BEING UNDERMINED. BEING UNDERMINED BY A HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS WHO ARE PROFITING FROM PUTTING CHILDREN AT RISK IN MAKING OUR SCHOOLS LESS SAFE. SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE THE GRANTING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BY POSITIONS WHICH EXPECTED DENTIST PAY THAT EACH CHILD WOULD BE EVALUATED BY A PHYSICIAN. WHO REGULARLY CARED FOR THAT CHILD AND RECEIVING THE EXEMPTION APPLYING THE STANDARD OF CARE? INSTEAD AFTER PASSAGE OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE WITNESSED PHYSICIANS TO ADVERTISE EXEMPTIONS FOR CASH AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET. SOME PARENTS WOULD POSTED THEIR CHILD'S POSITION REFUSED TO GRANT THEIR CHILD A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THEY BOUGHT ONE FROM A DISTANT POSITION AND IT. EXCUSE ME NO HIS SAME. PLEASE NO CLAPPING NO NO OUTBURSTS OF ANY KIND PLEASE. PLEASE PROCEED DOT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAIR. AN INVESTIGATION BY THE VOICE OF SAN DIEGO OF MEDICAL EXEMPTION SUBMITTED TO THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOW THAT ONE PHYSICIAN WHO WAS ADVERTISING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS UNDER WEBSITE. ISSUED ALMOST A THIRD OF ALL THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE PHYSICIAN WHO ISSUED THE SECOND MOST NUMBER OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT DOES NOT SPECIALIZE IN PEDIATRICS AND IS ACTUALLY ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THIS CARE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THE PROMINENT ANTI VACCINE PHYSICIAN BACH DR BOB SEARS WHO'S CURRENTLY ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR QUOTE GROSS NEGLIGENCE REPEATED NEGLIGENT ACTS. FOR GRANTING AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION ISSUED THE FOURTH GREATEST NUMBER MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND HE'S ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED HAVE GRANTED MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOLS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FORMULA FAR FROM IS PRACTICING CAPISTRANO. IN FACT TODAY THE SAN JOSE MERCURY REPORT ON INVESTIGATION MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH REVEALED THAT ONLY FIVE DOCTORS ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF. OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY EXEMPTIONS ACROSS THESE DISTRICTS. THREE OF THE DOCTORS IN THIS REPORT ARE ALREADY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE STATE. DOCTOR CAN THE STOLAR UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY ROAD EXEMPTIONS ACROSS EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT INCLUDED IN THAT ARTICLE. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONFIRM THAT DESPITE HIS PROBATION A STATUS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD DR BOB'S YEARS IS CONTINUING TO WRITE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THREE EXEMPTIONS WERE EVEN SIGNED BY OUT OF STATE DOCTORS. THE RESULTS OF THESE FAKE MEDICOS ENGINESWAS A QUADRUPLING OF THE PERCENTAGE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE STATE. AND THE DECLINE IN THE STATE VACCINATION RATE BELOW 95% THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR SO WE WERE ABOVE NOW WE'RE BELOW. BUT EVEN MORE CONCERNING BECAUSE OF THAT THE STATE WIDE RATE THAT MATTERS OVER A HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES OVER 10%. WITH SOME AS HIGH AS 50% MEETING STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOLS AT RISK FOR A MAJOR OUTBREAK AND ARE NO LONGER SAFE. THESE SCHOOLS REPRESENT THE TENDER FOR DISEASE WILD FIRE THAT CAN HARM THE BROADER COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA CANNOT ALLOW HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS TO PUT OUR CHILDREN IN DANGER. PARTICULARLY BABIES TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED IN CHILDREN WHO GENUINELY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN CAPPY APTRIX ARE SPONSORING SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX WITH THE PARENTS OF ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA. PHYSICIANS ARE DEMANDING THAT THEY HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND THE COLLEAGUES ACCOUNTABLE TO PRACTICING QUALITY CARE BASED ON SCIENCE TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. WHAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN UP FOR THIS COMMITTEE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WILL REQUIRE ALL MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO BE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH? AND PHYSICIANS WOULD HENCEFORTH BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. EXEMPTION REQUEST WILL BE STANDARDIZED REQUIRING ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FROM THE POSITION INCLUDING THEIR NAME IN LICENSE NUMBER THE REASON FOR THE EXCEPTION AND ATTESTATIONS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE CHILD. THAT THEY PROVIDE ON GOING CARE FOR THE CHILD AND WHETHER THEY ARE THE CHILD'S PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND THEY'RE NOT REPLYING POSITION WILL NEED TO A TEST THEY HAVE NOTIFIED THE CHILD'S PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT THEY'RE APPLYING FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. FOR THAT PRIMARY KERR'S PATIENT. THE INFORMATION WILL BE INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY WHICH ALREADY CONTAINS IMMUNIZATION RECORDS FOR CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY RECEIVE VACCINATIONS IS COMPLIANT WITH ALL FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE PROTECTING STE VERY SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA INCLUDING MAINTAIN A CANCER REGISTRY AND INFORMATION ON PATIENTS WITH COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INCLUDING. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND HIV. MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS REQUEST WILL BE REVIEWED IN A TARGETED MANNER. REQUEST FOR BUSINESS UNITS AND ROLLING SCHOOLS WITH IMMUNIZATION RATES BELOW 95% THE RATE FOR COMMUNITY ARE WHO DID NOT REPORT THE MUSICIAN RACE TO SEE PH. OR IF THEY RECEIVE REQUESTS FROM PHYSICIANS OR MAKING AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF EXEMPTION REQUESTS. WILL BE EXAMINED BY CLINICAL STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. LL OTHER EXEMPTION REQUEST WILL BE GRANTED WITHOUT FURTHER REVIEW. PHYSICIANS AND REGISTERED NURSES AT THE DEPARTMENT CAN ACCEPT EXEMPTIONS BASED ON EITHER THE CDC ARE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS GUIDELINES OR OTHER REASONS CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF CARE. EXEMPTION REQUEST THAT BABY INAPPROPRIATE WILL THEN BE REVIEWED BY THE STATE HEALTH OFFICER WHO IS A PHYSICIAN. OR DESIGNATE POSITION AND MAYBE REJECTED REVOKED. THE PARENT OR REQUESTING PHYSICIAN CAN APPEAL THIS DECISION TO A PANEL PRACTICING PHYSICIANS APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WHO ARE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE HAVE EXPERTISE IN VACCINATION INFECTIOUS DISEASE? IF EXEMPTION DECIDED TO BE REJECTED A REVOKED THE STUDENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMMENCE WITH RECOMMENDED IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE REQUIRED FOR CONDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WILL PROVIDE THE RECORD OVERSIGHT REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT STANDARD OF CARE SAFETY GUIDELINES OUR PLIGHT. AND ARE MOST AT RISK SCHOOLS AND EXTEND THAT OVERSIGHT TO PHYSICIANS TO SUBMIT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF EXEMPTIONS. CURRENTLY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE ISSUED BY PHYSICIANS TO FAMILIES WHO TO SUBMIT THEM TO SCHOOLS PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON WHICH CHILDREN HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THUS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WILL ALSO REQUIRE ALL EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO BE FILED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH TO BE VALID. THE REMAINS THEY'LL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME REVIEW PROCESS IS DESCRIBED. THE SUBMISSION OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO HELP CONTAIN. AN OUTBREAK LIKE THE ONES WERE EXPERIENCING NOW. IN THE EVENT OF AN OUTBREAK SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE TO REQUIRE UNVACCINATED STUDENTS REMAIN AT HOME TO PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. IN FACT THE NEED FOR THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN ILLUSTRATED BY A MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT KERR IN THE BAY AREA LAST SPRING. WHEN UNPACKS THE CHILD WAS INFECTED WITH MEASLES IN EUROPE AND RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISEASE? THAT CHILD THEN TRANSMIT THE DISEASE TO OTHER UNVACCINATED CHILDREN INCLUDING A FAMILY WHO LIED TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE VACCINATED. IN TRUTH THIS FAMILY HAD PURCHASED INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM A PHYSICIAN HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. BECAUSE THEY LIED. THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS DO NOT FOLLOW UP UNTIL THEY DISCOVERED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO WERE INFECTED WITH MEASLES. WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THESE EXAMS CHILDREN AND THEY TRACED IT BACK TO THIS FAMILY? AT HAVING HAD MEDICAL EXEMPTION INFORMATION COULD HAVE PREVENTED FURTHER SPREAD DISEASE BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THE CHILDREN WERE IN VACCINATED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY CORRECT -- CLARIFY COUPLE MISLEADING CLAIMS THAT BEEN MADE BY THE OPPOSITION TO DATE. FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE NO FDA APPROVED EXEMPTIONS TO VACCINATIONS. THE OPPOSITION HAS DISTRIBUTE A LIST OF PURPORTED SIDE EFFECTS OF VACCINES THAT THE CLAIMS ARE FTA RECOGNIZE REASONS FOR ISSUING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. MANY OF THE REASONS ON THE LIST STRAIN CREDULITY CLEANING SOMETHING LIKE HAIR LOSS. LET'S BE CLEAR THE FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES COMPOSED OF NATIONAL EXPERTS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND VACCINE SUPPLIES ON GOING RESEARCH. FROM SEVERAL VACCINE SAFETY MODERN PROGRAMS TO ISSUE THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS OF PRECAUTIONS TO VACCINATIONS. SECOND THE OPPOSITION HAD FALSELY CLAIMED THAT POSITIONS HAD NOT BEEN FOUND TO BE IT TO BE BE ISSUING FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND IN FACT CITED A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL PEDIATRICS THAT INCLUDES MEDICAL BOARD DATA. THAT NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE BOARD. NOW IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE PAPER THE PAPER ACTUALLY REPORTED THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS WERE FRUSTRATED. BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THERE ARE MANY AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HOWEVER WERE POWERLESS TO STOP THEM SINCE THE EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY WENT TO THE SCHOOLS AND EIGHT AND RECEIVE THEM DIRECTLY. IN ADDITION THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES HAD NO LEGAL AUTHORITY NOT TO ACCEPT THE EXEMPTIONS EVEN WHEN THEY KNEW THEY WERE PROBLEMATIC. SECOND THE MEDICAL BOARD IS BEING STYMIED. BY IT BECAUSE PARENTS PURCHASING INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE OBSTRUCTING INVESTIGATIONS BY REFUSING TO GIVE THE BOARD ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS SO CASES ARE BEING DROPPED BECAUSE THE BOARDS AND ABLE TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BOB SEARS WHO HAS BEEN PUT ON PROBATION BY THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR ISSUING AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION. ONLY THIS ONLY OCCURRED WHEN A PARENT COOPERATED WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. IN ADDITION THE MEDICAL BOARD RECENTLY WON AN APPEALS COURT RULING TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO RECORDS FROM DOCTOR RON KENNEDY OF SANTA ROSA. WHO ACTUALLY PRACTICES AND ANTI AGING CLINIC? AND IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR QUOTE IMPROPERLY ISSUING BLANKET MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINATION AND QUOTE. BUT DESPITE THIS EFFORT SO FAR THE MEDICAL BOARD IS STILL WAITING FOR DIRECTORS TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS HE RESISTS PROVIDING THOSE RECORDS. NOW SB TWO SEVENTY SIX ADDRESSES THESE BARRIERS BY REQUIRING THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION REQUEST INCLUDE A MEDICAL RECORD RELEASE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD INTO THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ALSO REQUIRES TO THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD REGARDING REJECTED EXEMPTION REQUESTS AND THE POSITIONS ARE ISSUING LARGE NUMBERS OF REJECTED REQUESTS. I POINT OUT IF THE REQUESTS ARE BEING REJECTED THEIR OF VALID THAT DOES NOT CREATE ANY PROBLEM FOR THE POSITION. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS ABOUT KEEPING OUR STATE AND COMMUNITY SAFE FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASES. THE REPORTS OF MEASLES OUTBREAKS THIS YEAR UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PASS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX TO MAINTAIN THE HARD WON GAINS WE MADE WITH SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE MUST NOT LET A HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS TO PROFIT BY ISSUING FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT UNDERMINE THE SAFETY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX HAS SUPPORT FROM LEADING PARENT AND CHILD ADVOCACY GROUPS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA PTA CHILDREN NOW THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AND MARCH OF DIMES EDUCATION GROUPS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING SEE SEC. THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATIONS OF CALIFORNIA THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES RENDON SANTA CLARA. AND CERTAINLY OF COURSE SUPPORT FROM A BROAD COALITION OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADING HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE ANALYSIS. NOW I AM PLEASED INTRODUCED THREE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HAVE FIRST JENNY BLACK BALLACK A PARENT OF THE IMMUNO COMPROMISED CHILD TO DEPENDS ON TO MEDIUM YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE. DR MARKET PARSONS A TRUSTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND DR ERIC UPON US BY THE WAY NO RELATION TO MYSELF IS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OF ALAMEDA COUNTY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB TWO SEVENTY SIX TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN BEFORE WE START THE YOUR TESTIMONY BY YOUR WITNESSES WERE GOING TO WE HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ROLE. AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I HEAR? MAYES [inaudible] BIGELOW [inaudible] BONTA BURKE. CARILLO. FLORA LIMON MCCARTY NAZARIAN RAMOS. YES I'M SORRY -- ARAMBULA SANTIAGO [inaudible] WALDRON. OKAY. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM SO THIS WILL BEGIN THE TEN TEN MINUTES OF TESTIMONY [inaudible] HI. MY NAME IS JENNY BALK AND I'M A MOTHER OF TWO WONDERFUL CHILDREN DALY AGE TWELVE AND BROOKE AGE. TEN AND I'M A FIFTH GRADE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW. MY DAUGHTER BROOKE WAS BORN TOTALLY HEALTHY. ON EASTER I IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND SIX WEEKS LATER BEGAN TO FEEL ILL. AND SHE HAD ACQUIRED A HEART DISEASE FROM A RANDOM VIRUS. AND SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY WHICH MEANT HER HEART WAS THREE TIMES THE SIZE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IT WAS TOLD US AT THE TIME IT'S A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS. AND THE ONLY HOPE WOULD BE A HEART TRANSPLANT. THE HEART TRANSPLANTS ONLY LAST AND AND AVERAGE TEN TO TWELVE YEARS SO WE WANTED TO WAIT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT TIME LINE GOING. WE WERE ABLE TO WAIT AT HOME WE HAD A ROLLER COASTER AND OF TWO YEARS IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS WITH A VERY WEAK LITTLE BABY AN ACTIVE TODDLER. AND AFTER TWO YEARS. AND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT -- HER HEART WAS NOT GOING TO KEEP HER ALIVE ANY LONGER. SHE WAS LISTED FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT WHEN SHE WAS TWO AND A HALF YEARS OLD. AND AFTER A THREE MONTH STAY AT UCLA'S -- PEDIATRIC ICU SHE RECEIVED THE GIFT OF LIFE. FROM A LITTLE ANGEL NAMED MALACHI LITTLE ONE AND A HALF YEAR OLD BOY. WHO SAVED HER LIFE? HI MY LITTLE CRAZY WARRIOR WAS WALKING THE HALLS OF THE HOSPITAL WITHIN ON DAY TWO WITH ONLY TYLENOL THROUGH HER SYSTEM WHICH I GUESS ONLY KIDS DO. AND WE CAME HOME ONE DAY. EIGHT SO WE WANTED TO CELEBRATE THE END OF THIS BIG JOURNEY BUT IT REALLY WASN'T THE END IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A WHOLE NEW SET OF ISSUES. AND WE'VE NEVER BUBBLE WRAPPED HER AND NEVER WOULD WANT TO SHE LEAVES AND LET LEADS A VERY VERY ACTIVE LIFESTYLE. SHE'S PLAYED CLUB SOCCER SHE'S CURRENTLY ON TO COMPETITIVE DANCE TEAMS SNOW SCHEME -- PLACE AT THE BEACH AND PRETTY MUCH SPENCER LIFE PLAYING HER YOU CLEARLY ON OUR FRONT PORCH AS THAT'S HER LATEST PASSION. I'M ONE OF BROOKS GREATEST JOYS IS ATTENDING SCHOOL. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE HER LIFE BEGAN WITH HEART DISEASE. AND SUBSEQUENTLY AND HAS TO TAKE IMMUNO SUPPRESSANTS DUE TO HER HEART TRANSPLANT. SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE THAT AND PROTECTION OF LIVE VACCINES LIKE HER OLDER BROTHER DEAD. I'M FOR MEASLES CHICKEN POX AND OTHER DISEASES. WE CAN ON EVERYONE AROUND HER BEING IMMUNIZED TO KEEP HER WELL PROTECTED. KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL WHO HAVE ACTUAL MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL. THOSE FAMILIES HAVE SEEN THEIR CHILD ON THE BRINK OF DEATH. IF THEY HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF A TRANSPLANT OR CANCER OR A RARE DISEASE. AND BEING IN PUBLIC EDUCATION SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE MADE IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE AND CAN LIVE A SEMI NORMAL LIFESTYLE EVEN IF IT'S A TEMPORARY STAY IN SCHOOL. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT FEAR OF A PREVENTABLE DISEASE SENDING HIM BACK TO THE HOSPITAL OR WORSE. AT MY TWENTY YEARS IN EDUCATION HAS TAUGHT ME THAT PARENTS EVERYWHERE JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR KIDS THAT'S ALL ANYBODY WANT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BUT WHAT THEY FEEL IS RIGHT FOR THEIR KIDS PUTS MY CHILD IN MORTAL JEOPARDY EVERY DAY. WE HAVE HAD WHIPPING COUGH IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD TWO WEEKS AGO. MY DAUGHTER DOES COMPETITIVE DANCE IT WAS A CAN ANOTHER DANCE STUDIO IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS. PREVALENT WE ARE TWENTY MINUTES FROM DOCTOR SEARS WHO DOCTOR PATTEN AT MENTIONED. IT IS EVERYWHERE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE LAWS ALREADY IN PLACE TO PROTECT THESE MEDICAL FRAGILE ANGELS. SO I ASK YOU SUPPORT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX TO ENSURE THAT THAT LAW. IS RESPECTED. AND TAKENAS SERIOUSLY AS ANY OTHER LAW OUT THERE THAT IS. CREATED TO PROTECT INNOCENT CHILDREN THANK YOU. SIX WITH THE NEXT WITNESS. I'M NOT A GREAT I'M DOCTOR MARGARET PARSONS A POSITION HERE IN SACRAMENTO A DERMATOLOGIST DOING MEDICAL DERMATOLOGY OF PEDIATRIC IN OUT OF CASES. BUT I'M ALSO HERE MORE IMPORTANTLY AS A TRUSTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF FORTY FOUR THOUSAND POSITIONS. WHEN I TOLD COLLEAGUES I'D BE TESTIFYING HERE TODAY AND NOT THE OFF THEY SAID PLEASE GO SURE MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS TO PUBLIC HEALTH? SB TWO SEVEN SIX PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S OF ALL AGES PARTICULAR CHILDREN WHO NEED US. AS A MEDICAL STUDENT THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES I THOUGHT ASIAN CHILD FROM A NATION OUTSIDE WHO IMMIGRATED HERE. WHO HAD MEASLES LIKE WILDLIFE HE HAD NOT BEEN VACCINATED HE'D HAD NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS HE COULD NOT WALK HE COULD NOT MOVE MY FACULTY SAID? WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS MEASLES IS A RADIC HATED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WITHOUT VACCINATION WE WILL SEE DISEASE AND DEATH. SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN INCREASED OVERALLS ALRIGHT BUT IT HASN'T GOTTEN ALL THE WAY THERE WE HAVE TOO MANY EXEMPTIONS MORE THAN A HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE MORE THAN 10% OF THE POPULATION NOT VACCINATED. AND SOME OF THE SCHOOLS ARE HIGHS IN THE TWENTY AND 30% AND UNVACCINATED CHILDREN. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE JOURNAL PEDIATRICS CONCLUDED LONG TERM IMPACT OF SB TWO SEVEN WILL BE LIMITED UNLESS WE ENACT POLICIES SUCH AS DOCTOR PANTS. TWO SEVEN SIX TURNOUT FURTHER OVERSIGHT FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. WHY IS MEASLES CONCERNING AND SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THE RASH MAY NOT SHOW UP FOR FOUR DAYS A CHILD BE CONTAGIOUS FOR FOUR DAYS BEFORE WE MIGHT EVEN SEE THE RASH AND BEGUN SUSPICION THAT THE CHILD MIGHT BE CONTAGIOUS? THEIR CONTAGIOUS FOR EIGHT DAYS. THIS IS DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN SUCH AS THE ONE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT ANOTHER IMMUNO COMPROMISED KIDS WHO HAVE CANCER LET ME KNOW COMPROMISED STATES DUE TO TRANSPLANT AND THERE'S A LOT OF THESE KIDS DOING WONDERFUL THINGS. IN RECENT MONTHS WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN A THOUSAND CASES IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT MEASLES OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH MAJOR. THE BILL SB TWO SEVEN SIX ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS WILL BE THE ONLY EXEMPTIONS WE NEED TO TO PROTECT OUR KIDS IN OUR STATE. PLEASE. JOIN ME ON THE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PHYSICIAN MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND VOTE YES. TODAY AND HELP THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH MAJOR MOVE FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIANS. THREE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR ERICA. I AM CURRENTLY THE INTERN HEALTH OFFICER FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I'M HERE TODAY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS JUST JOINED THE LIST OF COUNTIES AS WELL TO SUPPORT SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX I AM ALSO A PRACTICING INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST STILL SEEING PATIENTS AND I'M A PARENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL. REALLY NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS A BROAD COMMUNITY TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE FROM VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES BY MAINTAINING COMMUNITY IMMUNITY. AS YOU'VE HEARD WE'VE ALREADY HAD MORE CASES OF MEASLES IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TH AND IN ALL OF LAST YEAR. IN EUROPE IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEY'VE HAD OVER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND CASES AND THIRTEEN DEATHS. IN A SENSE GO BAY AREA ALONE THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD TWELVE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED AND ACROSS THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTRES HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED. TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATION OF SUSPECT AND CONFIRMED CASES AND EXPOSE CONTACTS. IN MY EXPERIENCE WE TYPICALLY IDENTIFY ABOUT A HUNDRED CONTACTS FOR EVERY SINGLE CASE. IN ADDITION TO THE RISK OF BRAIN INFECTION OR DEATH AND THE HIGH PROPORTION OF HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO MEASLES. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE IS SIGNIFICANT AND COSTLY. WE ESTIMATE THE COST RANGE FROM TEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CASE. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MEASLES OUTBREAK PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. AND MOST LIKELY IN UNDER ESTIMATE. WE KNOW IN SEE THAT THESE OUTBREAKS STARTIN AND ARE DRIVEN BY CLUSTERS OF UNVACCINATED PERSONS. THIS PUTS THOSE WERE VALID MEDICAL REASONS LIKE BROOKE NOT DEMONIZED. WHO HAVE YOUNG AGE -- SUPPRESSED IMMUNE SYSTEMS PUT THEM AT RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE WHEN OTHERS ARE NOT VACCINATED. WELL THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THEIR APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION. PUBLIC HEALTH DOES NOT HAVE CURRENT DATA ON WHERE INVALID EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED BUT WE RECEIVE REPORTS FROM CONCERNED AND FRUSTRATED SCHOOL NURSES RECEIVING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED. BY ONLINE EVALUATIONS ANTI AGING CLINICS HYPERBARIC MEDICINE CLINICS DOCTORS ON PROBATION WHO ARE MILES AND MILES AND MILES AWAY. FOR HIGH FEES RATHER THAN BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT. REQUIRING PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEW OF CONCERNING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES WILL PREVENT THIS INAPPROPRIATE PRACTICE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL GIVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE THANK YOU.

IN BETWEEN IN BETWEEN SO WE'LL ASK THOSE TWO WITNESSES TO COME FORWARD -- LACEY SCOTT. AND JENNIFER SOME OF US. PLEASE COME FORWARD. HELLO I'M JENNIFER SOMOS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THE BOARD HAS A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT POSITION ON THIS BILL THE BOARD SUPPORTS THE CONCEPTS AN SP TWO SEVENTY SIX THAT ALLOW THE BOARD TO RECEIVE THE MEDICAL RECORDS. RELATED TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND REQUIRE REVIEW OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ALLOWING THE BOARD TO RECEIVE THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF MEADOW OAK MEDICAL EXEMPTION CASES WILL REMOVE THE OBSTACLES OF WARS CURRENTLY FACING. AND ALLOW THE BOARDS EXPERTS TO REVIEW THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND PINE IF THE POSITION FALL THE STANDARD OF CARE. DURING THE DISCUSSION ON SB TWO SEVENTY SIX OF THE BOARD'S INTERMEDIUM. NUMEROUS FOR MEMBERS RAISED ISSUES REGARDING THE CDC GUIDELINES BEING TOO NARROW AND THE APPROPRIATE INTO TO TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OF THE REVIEW OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS APPEARS THAT ONE OF THESE ISSUES HUSBAND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THE BOARD WILL BE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND POSSIBLY TAKING A NEW POSITION ON THIS BILL AT ITS NEXT MEETING IN AUGUST THANK YOU THIS. THANK YOU MEMBERS MY NAME IS LACI SCOTTON I'D LIKE TO ENTER MY SUPPORT. ONLY F. SB TWO SEVEN SIX IS PROPERLY AMENDED TO ALLOW THE DOCTOR TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR PATIENT BASED UPON. THEIR PERSONAL AND FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY. FIRST I I'D LIKE IT TO BE KNOWN THAT I AM NOT AGAINST VACCINES. I HAVE A PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY WHICH MEANS I AM IMMUNE COMPROMISED AND I'M IN NEED OF HER COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS AN ANTI VACCINE FIRST PRO VACCINE DEBATE WHEN WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES IS TAKE AWAY A DOCTOR'S RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR PATIENTS UNIQUE MEDICAL SITUATION AND PUTS IT IN THE HANDS OF A GOVERNMENT APPOINTED OFFICIAL WHO HAS NEVER. MET OR EXAMINES THE CHILD IN QUESTION. AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF LIFE FILLED WITH MYSTERY ILLNESS I WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY ALONG WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS. AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE SEVERE VACCINE REACTIONS ALONG THE WAY. THESE IMMUNE DISORDERS AREN'T AS EASY TO DIAGNOSIS SENATOR PAN HAS SUGGESTED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS. AND THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY THE NEARLY DEFINED LIST OF CONTRA INDICATIONS THAT ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS FILM. I HAVE FIVE YEAR OLD TWINS WHO HAVE HAD. TO HAVE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF INHERITING SOME OR ALL OF MY IMMUNE DISORDERS. THEY HAVE ALSO HAD SEVERE. VACCINE REACTIONS THAT MIMICKED THE REACTIONS I'VE EXPERIENCED. WE HAVE CONSULTED HIGHLY TRAINED CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGISTS RHEUMATOLOGIST AND PEDIATRICIANS INNER CONSENSUS AS THAT IT WOULD BE TOO RISKY TO KEEP VACCINATING MY CHILDREN. DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF SEVERE VACCINE REACTIONS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VALID VACCINE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE NOT FRAUDULENT. OUR UNIQUE MEDICAL SCENARIO DOES NOT FIT WITHIN THE NARROW DEFINED LIST OF CONTRIBUTIONS IT IS. IT IS NOT LEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE LESS THAN 1% OF CHILDREN WITH LEGITIMATE VACCINE EXEMPTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION DUE TO FAMILY HISTORY OR A MEDICAL DISORDER THAT IS OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. FAMILIES WITH IMMUNE DISORDERS OR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM VACCINE REACTION REACTIONS. SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IMAGINE WHAT MY CHILDREN'S EDUCATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IF I WAS FORCED TO HOME SCHOOL. THEM BETWEEN DOCTOR VISITS HOSPITAL STAYS MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND ILLNESSES. LASTLY IT APPEARS THAT THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS MADE PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR FAMILIES LIKE MY OWN BY CONSIDERING FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY. HOWEVER I REMAIN CONCERNED. FOR INSTANCE DOCTORS WRITING LEGITIMATE. MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS CAN BE UNFAIRLY TARGETED AND PUNISHED BY THE FIVE OR MORE EXEMPTION RULE FORCING ALL DOCTORS. ALL OF THE DOCTORS VACCINE EXEMPTIONS TO BE REVIEWED IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT OFFICES THAT SPECIALIZE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER AND OTHER IMMUNE DISORDERS WILL BE PUT THROUGH. NOT TO MENTION THE STRICT PENALTY OF NO LESS THAN A TWO YEAR BAN ON WRITING ANY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IF A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL TAKES ISSUE WITH JUST ONE OF THOSE EXEMPTIONS. HE EVEN AYE LEGITIMATE DOCTORS WILL NOT BE. COMPELLED TO WRITE A FIFTH EXEMPTION. BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE MEMBERS TO HOLD THE BILL IN HEALTH COMMITTEE UNTIL. THE DETAILS -- MORE FULLY VETTED. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR YES -- I FISHY IS A CHAIR OF CANADIAN HEALTH AND THE OTHER HOUSE -- THAT YOU OF COURSE -- I RESPECT YOUR DECISIONS -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY -- MAKE NOTE THAT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM TIME FOR THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT MISS DOCTOR PAN -- WAS BUT RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE PLEASE NO [inaudible] PLEASE. THIS POINT TO OUR LAST FOR THE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. SO YEAH PLEASE DON'T WANT OKAY WE HAVE LOOKS LIKE. SIX WITNESSES ARE THERE MORE. EIGHT WITNESSES YOUHAVE A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DIVVY IT UP WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS STEPHANIE FETZER AND THE FOUNDER OF A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION CALLED PARENTS UNITED FOR KIDS WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS BILL AND THIS ISSUE? I'VE SPOKEN WITH MOST MANY OF YOU. MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. AND YOUR CONSIDERATION. RESPECTFULLY THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY AND REALLY AS WE SHARE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU. POSITIONS RIGHTS MY NAME IS LEE DUNDAS. THIS LAW. IS UNPRECEDENTED. IT TAKES THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND PUTS IT SQUARELY INTO THE CENTER OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND IT GOES ONE STEP FURTHER. IT GIVES A STATE ACTOR THE RIGHT TO BAN BLOCK COUNTERMANDED DENY AND REVOKE. YOUR LICENSED AND MY LICENSE MEDICAL DOCTORS MEDICAL DECISIONS THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED TERRITORY EVEN AS AMENDED THAT THAT IS WHAT'S DONE HERE. THE ISSUE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES IS NOT IF THE STATE GETS IT WRONG. IT'S WHEN THE STATE GETS IT WRONG. BECAUSE ANY OF US EVEN A GOOD PHYSICIAN WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO SIT IN FRONT OF A STACK OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF PAPER SINGLE SHEETS OF PAPER MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. AND WITHOUT EVER HAVING LAID EYES ON THE PATIENT WITHOUT EVER HAVING DONE A PHYSICAL EXAM OR TEST ON THE PATIENT. GET THAT ANALYSIS RIGHT. I DON'T THINK THE PERSON ABOVE COULD GET IT RIGHT IF YOU WERE HERE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK I COULD OR ANY STATE ACTOR COULD. AND WHEN NOT GO SIDE WAYS AND IT WILL. AND THEY MAKE A BAD DECISION AND A LEGITIMATE A LEGITIMATE. VALID MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS REVOKED AND THE CHILD WANTS TO STAY IN SCHOOL AND GETS VACCINATED AND THAT CHILD DIES. WHAT HAPPENS THEN THAT IS THE QUESTION AND UNDER TWO SEVENTY SIX UNDER SB TWO SEVENTY SIX THE ANSWER IS NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE STATE ACTORS HAVE ABSOLUTE? GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY. THAT IS A FRIGHTENING IS ZERO LIABILITY SITUATION WE HAVE AND RUN AND COMPLETELY TOSSED OUT EVERY SINGLE SYSTEM A CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT KEEP ACTUAL PRACTICING DOCTORS IN THE RIGHT LANE. MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CARRIER STATE BOARD REVOCATION OF LICENSES CIVIL ATTORNEYS AND PROSECUTORS WHO KEEP THEIR IN THE LIGHT WE HAVE AND RUN THAT SYSTEM. THE STATE CANNOT PRACTICE MEDICINE IF YOU GO RIGHT NOW TO THE MEDICAL BOARD WEBSITE AND YOU TYPE IN FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARTIFICIAL ENTITIES. STATES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAN IS A RUN AWAY FREIGHT TRAIN AND THERE ARE NO CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THAT SYSTEM AND THAT IS TERRITORY NO MATTER WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE TODAY. THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD WANT TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES OR THEIR MOTHER DIAGNOSE FOR TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER AND FIND OUT TWO WEEKS LATER FROM A STATE ACTOR AFTER THEIR NAME IN THE DOCTOR'S NAME HAD BEEN DATA BASED. THAT THEY WERE CANCELLING THE INSULIN PRESCRIPTION OR WITHHOLDING CANCER TREATMENT ONCE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD IT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE IT'S A ONE WAY STREET AND THERE'S NO COMING BACK. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO ABSTAIN OR VOTE NO AND FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEN MAC ROSENBERG AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH OVER TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCTS LIABILITY IN INSURANCE COVERAGE LITIGATION. SB TWO SEVEN SIX EVEN AS AMENDED IS ABOUT COERCION LACK OF DUE PROCESS AND INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS INVASION OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS LONG BEEN A CHAMPION OF PRIVACY AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THROUGH LAWS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. BUT THROUGH SB TWO SEVEN SIX WOULD VIOLATE SEVERAL PRIVACY RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS IT'S POISED TO BE THE PARTY OF SURVEILLANCE OVER PEOPLE. WAIVERS ABOUT VOLUNTARY RELINQUISHMENT OF A RIGHT BUT THERE IS NOTHING VOLUNTARY ABOUT THIS PROCESS. TO REQUEST AN EMMY A PARENT MUST FIRST AGREE TO RELEASE HER CHILD'S MEDICAL FILES TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD. THIS IS AN AFFRONT TO HIPAA THE FEDERAL LAW THAT PROTECTS MEDICAL INFORMATION AND IT AND RUN AROUND FOR BUG WHICH PREVENTS SCHOOLS FROM RELEASING STUDENTS PRIVATE INFORMATION. SB TWO SEVEN SIX REQUIRES THAT ALL ENEMIES BE SUBMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY CARE WITH NO CHANCE TO OPT OUT. DESPITE THE OPT OUT OPTION AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE ELSE. THERE IS NO VALID REASON FOR THESE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS VACCINE EXEMPTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF SCHOOLS AND THERE'S NO HISTORY OF PROBLEMS IN SCHOOLS DURING OUTBREAKS WITH MONITORING THAT INFORMATION. SB TWO SEVEN SIX ALSO VIOLATES DUE PROCESS WITH POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC RESULTS. FIRST APPEALING IN ANY DOES NOT PROTECT THE CHILD SB TWO SEVEN SIX REQUIRES THAT A CHILD WHOSE DOCTOR HAS DETERMINED. UPON EXAMINATION OF THAT CHILD THE VACCINATION. MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH TO THAT CHILD THAT THE CHILD BE VACCINATED DURING THE PENDENCY OF THEIR APPEAL. SECOND THERE'S NO UNBIASED REVIEW AN APPEAL PROCESS THE ONLY PEOPLE REVIEWING EMMYS AN APPEALS OF DENIALS ARE OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES ARE THOSE WERE. APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE SECRETARY HAS THE FINAL WORD. CHILDREN WILL HAVE THEIR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS DENIED OR REVOKED THE BE DEPRIVED OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND HAVE NO ABILITY TO GO TO COURT TO APPEAL THE SECRETARY'S DENIAL OF THEIR MEDICAL EXEMPTION. WITH RESPECT TO SB TWO SEVENTY SIX REQUIREMENT THE D. O. H. REVIEW REPORTS FROM SCHOOL TO IDENTIFY SCHOOLS WITH THE LOWER THAN 95% VACCINATION RATE THIS IS REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATE IN THOSE SCHOOLS. THAT RATE IS LESS THAN 1% STATE WIDE IT CREATES AN UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL AND TIME BURDEN ON BOTH THE STATE AND THE SCHOOLS. AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE REAL REASONS THAT SOME SCHOOLS ARE BELOW THAT 95% RATE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF SCHOOLS ARE CLASSIFIED AS NOT UP TO DATE OR BANAL BELOW 95%. BUT 92% OF THOSE SCHOOLS HAVE FEWER THAN FOUR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND MORE THAN HALF HAVE. ZERO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE NOT UP TO DATE SCHOOLS. THOSE NUMBERS ARE LOWER BECAUSE A CONDITIONAL ENTRANCE AN OVERDUE STUDENTS STUDENTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. AND WHAT ABOUT INVESTIGATING DOCTORS WHO WRITE MORE THAN FIVE EMMYS PER YEAR. THIS ARBITRARY NUMBER APPEARS TO ARISE FROM. A BASELESS ASSUMPTION THE DOCTORS WHO WRITE ENEMIES ARE ENGAGING IN UNPROFESSIONAL OR FRAUDULENT CONDUCT. IT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR PEDIATRIC SPECIALISTS WHO TREAT VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND IT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT PRACTICE SIZES. FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CEILING IS FIVE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN IN YOUR PRACTICE OR TWO THOUSAND OR TEN THOUSAND DOCTORS MAY BE FORCED TO PICK PATIENTS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN WEIGHING. WHO SHOULD RECEIVE ONE OF THESE FEW COVETED EXEMPTIONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR PRACTICES? AND NOT WITHSTANDING CLAIMS AN UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS ARE SELLING EXEMPTIONS DESPITE DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD HAS NOT DISCIPLINED A SINGLE. POSITION FOR WRITING AN EXEMPTION PURSUANT TO SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN IN FACT IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EARLIER TESTIMONY THAT THE BOARD HAS AVAILABLE TO IT MEANS TO OBTAIN MEDICAL RECORDS IF THEY FEEL THEY NEED TO DO THAT. MANY OF THE POSITIONS THAT SB TWO SEVEN SIX SEEKS TO INTIMIDATE AND CENTER ARE ACTUALLY AHEAD OF THE AVERAGE PHYSICIAN IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF VACCINE ENTRY EPIGENETICS GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IN AUTOIMMUNITY. THEY KEEP UP ON EMERGING SCIENCE AD THEY MAKE PAPER PATIENT CENTERED DECISIONS. BASED ON PRECISION MEDICINE IT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO THIS STATE TO ITS POSITIONS AND ITS CITIZENS. TO CENTER AND INTIMIDATE THOSE POSITIONS FOR PRACTICING MEDICINE ACCORDING TO MOST UP TO DATE SCIENCE IF FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL CODE WHICH RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING DOCTORS IN THE FOREFRONT OF MEDICINE. AND IT REPRESENTS A HUGE STEP BACKWARDS FROM PRECISION PATIENT CENTERED MEDICINE I URGE YOU TRIPS STAIN OR VOTE NO ON SB. TWO SEVEN SIX BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOUR EIGHT EIGHT MINUTES AND TWENTY FIVE SECONDS OF YOUR TEN MINUTES. MY NAME IS DOCTOR BOB SEARS I'M A PEDIATRICIAN TRAINED AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES. THIS BILL WILL SCARE DOCTORS AWAY FROM WRITING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR CHILDREN WHO NEED THEM. DOCTORS ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR PRACTICE AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD OVER A MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATION. HERE IS WHY EVEN IF A DOCTOR WINS THEIR CASE BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD JUDGE AND THE JUDGE DECIDES THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT. THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN STILL PUT THE DOCTOR ON PROBATION. IT'S BASICALLY STOP AND FRISK YOU ARE PRESUMED GUILTY IN MY CASE THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHY I AM ON PROBATION IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF A SCHOOL VACCINE MEDICAL EXEMPTION. WAS A BITTER CUSTODY DISPUTE OVER AN INFANT WHO SUFFERED SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL HARM THE TODD WANTED TO FORCE MORE VACCINES. I WROTE A CORD OPINION LETTER AND THE JUDGE AGREED WITH ME THE JOB REPORTED NEW THE MEDICAL BOARD. ONE DANGER OF THIS BILL IS WHAT HAPPENS TO DOCTORS WHO GO ON PROBATION I KNOW I'VE TO PAY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN PROBATION FEES. EVEN THOUGH I'VE NEVER HAD A SINGLE MALPRACTICE CASE MY MALPRACTICE INSURANCE HAS DOUBLED BECAUSE OF PROBATION. I LOST MY INSURANCE CONTRACTS INCLUDING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILITARY FAMILIES I WAS TAKING CARE OF FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ON PROBATION WHAT DOCTORS GOING TO SIGN UP FOR THIS SOON NO ONE WILL BE LEFT TO TO SERVE THIS MINORITY. WHO SUFFER CAESAR'S NERVE INJURIES ARE A LOT NEUROLOGICAL REACTIONS YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD THESE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN BROADENED -- THE EXEMPTION GUIDELINES AND THEY'VE ADDED FAMILY HISTORY THAT IS NOT TRUE. THERE ARE NO REAL FAMILIES TO GUIDELINES THAT ARE PRACTICAL THAT ARE EXEMPT ANYBODY. AND EVEN WORSE THIS BILL PRESSURES DOCTORS INTO GIVING MORE VACCINES TO A CHILD YOU MAY KNOW MIGHT HAVE A SEVERE REACTION AND THAT'S A TRAGEDY. THE MINUTES TESTIMONY PERIOD IS UP [inaudible] YEAH. KNOWLEDGE OF SELF DEFENSE IN OPPOSITION. OPPOSITION. I'M DOCTOR SHARE MILLER THE PRESIDENT OF PHYSICIANS FOR INFORMED CONSENT IN OPPOSITION. AB MEN SMITH IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WE WILL [inaudible] ON REFLECTION. I'M GONNA GIVE DOCTOR PAN AN EXTRA MINUTE OR TWO BECAUSE I DO A REFLECTION DO AGREE THAT SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD FROM. SOMEONE I THOUGHT WAS IN BETWEEN DID FEEL MORE LIKE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. AND SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AN EXTRA MINUTE OR TWO A TEAR YOUR LONG MY WITH THIS IS THE GIVEN EXTRA MINUTES WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH YOU OR YOUR WITNESSES OKAY -- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS BUT I I YOU KNOW I I CAN -- I I WOULD. YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL -- ADDRESS MANY ISSUES IN WHICH THE CURRENT FLOWS AND I I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. TO SHARE I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT -- THERE AND APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SO -- BUT I SO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY FROM THE AYE ENSIGN ASKED THAT WE CLEAR THE TABLE AND DOES BEGIN THAT SECTION THANK YOU BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. SO ALASKA. AS GOAL. TO HAVE A SEAT OUT THERE AS WE SEE THE REST OF THE REST OF THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION SO. SO AT THIS POINT -- WE WILL HEAR.

AN ORGANIZATION THAT YOU MIGHT REPRESENT AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY WILL ASK THAT ONLY THE ADULTS TESTIFIED PLEASE.

AND WE WILL NOT AND LESS YOU AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER ONE AT DIRECT QUESTION FROM AN ANSWER FROM SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD ASK THAT PEOPLE NOT INTERJECT THEIR ANSWERS LET THE QUESTIONS COME TO ME. COME TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PLEASE OKAY. SOUTH MR BONTA. I THINK IT OUT TO PAN FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND FOR BRINGING THIS BEFORE I'VE HAD A COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BASED ON SOME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD. FROM -- MEMBERS THE PUBLIC TODAY. MY FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT FAMILY HISTORY -- THEY'VE BEEN SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT TODAY CAN CAN FAMILY HISTORY ALONE. BE GROUNDS FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND IF SO -- Q. TALK ABOUT WHERE THAT IS IN THE BILL OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY THERE ARE CONDITIONS WHERE FAMILY HISTORY ALONE -- WOULD WARRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND IN FACT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN THE ACTUAL CDC GUIDELINES THEMSELVES -- SO EVEN NOT EVEN LOOKING BEYOND THAT WHICH THIS BILL DOES ALLOW BY THE WAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN STANDARD CARE BUT EVEN THE CDC GUIDELINES SAY THE FOR EXAMPLE OF YOU HAVE. A FAMILY HISTORY WHERE THE CHILD A FIRST DEGREE RELATIVE A CHILD HAS AS THEY CAN GENERAL OR HEREDITARY IMMUNO DEFICIENCY -- THEY CAN BE GRANTED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. SO ON SOLELY ON THE FAMILY HISTORY ALONE -- I PERHAPS I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT I WAS THE AUTHOR OF A BILL TO BE SURE WE SCREEN ALL NEWBORNS FOR SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WHICH WE NOW IT'S ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO -- I THINK ABOUT I'M THE ONE WHO ALSO -- AUTHORED THE LEGISLATION TO BE SURE WE SCREEN CHILDREN WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK THAT TO BE SURE THEY'RE TESTED AND FOUND BEFORE THE EVEN RECEIVE -- IT THE OTHER TWO MONTH EXCEEDS. MISTER MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER POTTER THANK YOU -- YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY I I TALKED ABOUT IT BEING AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR FOR ME. AND YOU'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THE THEIR IMPRINT. DO YOU REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY HAVE THE WORDS FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY IN THE BILL YES THAT THAT YES THAT THAT WORDING IS IN THE BILL CORRECT OKAY ANNA AND I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. IT'S ON PAGE TEN LINE SEVENTEEN IT'S CLEARLY THERE. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SET OF FACTS WHILE TALKING ON THE SAME BILL. WHEN WE HAVE OUR DIALOGUE IN OUR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY -- ANOTHER THING AT MISTER CHAIR IT IS TO WOULD LIKE TO GET OTHER MEMBERS FIRST BEFORE PLEASE GO AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE IN YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING -- TURNING TO ANOTHER TOPIC YES. THE ISSUE OF DOCTORS PROVIDING FIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS A YEAR IS THAT A LIMIT OR A CAP ON HOW MANY MEDICAL EXEMPTION AS THEY CAN PROVIDE ORDERS THAT TRIGGER SOMETHING ELSE. NO IT IS NOT A LIMIT OR CATH I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS THAT IF YOU WRITE MORE THAN FIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS -- THERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS THAT'S FAIRLY UNUSUAL I'M A PEDIATRICIAN I PRACTICED AT UC DAVIS WHERE MY PRACTICE AS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN INCLUDED MANY CHILDREN THE COMPLEX CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE WERE TO SHERRY CARE CENTER RIGHT WHERE AN ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTER. AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK I'VE WRITTEN EVEN TEN MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN TWELVE YEARS WHEN I WAS THERE TO FAIRLY THE VERY RARE. BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE IT'S AN COLLEGES MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN MANY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. SO THEY WILL BE LOOKED AT AND THEY'LL POINT OUT THAT THE PATIENTS HAVE. CANCER TO MEET YOU FOR CANCER AND THOSE AT ALL BE LEGITIMATE THE ONLY THING THAT TRIGGERS THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU HAVE. FIVE SUSPECT EXEMPTIONS THAT THEN AFTER ONLY AFTER REVIEW WHERE IT'S BEEN VIEWED BY CLINICAL STAFF AT C. P. H. THEN PERHAPS REJECTED BY A PEER REVIEW PANEL. AND WE SAY WELL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING AND PERHAPS -- THERE OUGHT TO BE GREATER SCRUTINY BY THE MEDICAL BOARD WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION SO THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS BEFORE ANYTHING WOULD HAPPEN. SO I JUST POINT OUT THAT IF THEY IF YOU WROTE. DEL -- TEN TWENTY LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IS ALSO LEGITIMATE YOU'RE FINE AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND WE SIMPLY SAYING THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THEM. BUT THERE FIND A FINE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION SENATOR DR PAM I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION IF IT'S OKAY OF THE CHECK -- YOU MENTION PEER REVIEW RIGHT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF PEER REVIEW IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE YES SO -- TRADITIONALLY PEER REVIEW IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WE JUDGE WHETHER A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN IS. A IS ACTUALLY PRACTICING A WITHIN THEIR PROCREATE SPHERE OR THEY ARE PERHAPS DOING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE UNJUSTIFIED ON ETHICAL -- SO WE HAVE YOUR REVIEW BODIES AND HOSPITALS TO LOOK AT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND BEHAVIOR WE HAVE PEER REVIEW BODIES AND MEDICAL SOCIETIES WHEN THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ABOUT POSITIONS. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE ALL IF SOME OF US OF ALL THE LEGISLATION BELIEVE YOU HAVE A SUMMER BONTA WHERE ACTUALLY IF THERE IS A CHALLENGE. TO THE WAY SOMEONE BILLS THERE IS A PURE PERSON WHO REVIEWS THAT DEPARTMENTS HEALTH CARE TO LOOK AT THE DAY BEHAVIOR PROGRAMS APPEAR IF YOU IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND AND THE BEST EARLY IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. TO ASSESS HAS A POSITION ACTED OUTSIDE OF WHAT WOULD BE STANDARD OF CARE NO MORE PRACTICE AND ARE THEY POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING OTHER PATIENTS ARE NOT PRACTICING UP TO QUALITY -- THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED WE USE PEER REVIEW IS A WAY TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT. AND HAVE USED. YOU IN SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AS WELL YES SO THIS AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- WHILE THE INITIAL REVIEWS DONE BY A TRAINED CLINICIANS SIDE THEY ARE. ON THIS ISN'T PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE EXPERTISE -- THAT IF THERE IS AN APPEAL IT WILL GO TO A PEER REVIEW PANEL OF PHYSICIANS WHO. ARE APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY AND I WOULD POINT OUT THE REASON APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE NORMALLY DO THINGS -- IN TERMS OF HAVING BODIES HERE IN REGARDING OVERSIGHT IN THE STATE RIGHT AND IN FACT THE BILL DOES SAY THAT THAT BODY SO THAT SOMEONE SAID WELL IT'S A SECRETARY THE SIDES. BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S RIGHT THE SECRETARY IS REQUIRED TO TAKE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS PANEL SO THAT THEY THEY THEY CAN'T THE PANEL SAYS WELL TO THE GYM AT THEN THE SECRETARY SAYS OKAY IT'S LEGITIMATE THAT'S THE WAY THE BILL THIS FRIEND. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ANALYSIS. THANK YOU SENATOR DR PAN I AM WITH SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WITH YOUR BILL TODAY I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE PUTTING FORWARD IN PROMOTING GOOD. SCIENCE BASED PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND I THINK YOU'VE TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TODAY WITH PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FIVE YOU'LL ILLEGITIMATE AND NON SCIENCE BASED. MEDICAL RECORD MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO ALLOW A ROBUST SET OF LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS I PLAN TO SUPPORT A BILL TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS MUCH SOMETHING ABOUT. WITH RESPECT AT SOME POINT. LET'S JUST EXCUSE ME UNLESS IT'S YOUR ASK DIRECTLY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- THESE GO THROUGH ME OR TO DIRECTLY TO DOCTOR PANTS SO THERE IS NO INTERJECTION OF ASKING QUESTIONS UNDERSTOOD. SO THIS MONTH. THANK YOU I I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT DESPITE WERE WE ALL MAY BE ON THIS ISSUE -- THAT DAY YOU KNOW A FIND ITS -- REALLY BUT A HARD TO TO SEE HOW MANY PERSONAL ATTACKS YOU YOU TOOK -- ON THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A HARD ISSUE AND FOR MANY OF US THE DEBATE IS NOT. BASED ON A POLITICAL SIDE IT'S NOT BASED ON ANY ORGANIZATION IT IS NOT BASED ON A GOOD VERSUS BAD. IT IS HOW DO YOU HELP PARENTS WHO LOVE THEIR KIDS RIGHT. AND WANT THE BEST FOR THEM. AND HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. AND SO I I JUST I I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE AS I HEARD THE COMMENTS I THINK THAT'S LOST ON FOLKS I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT IT'S THIS GROUP OR THAT GROUP -- WHILE SO MANY PEOPLE DEBATE HOW DO WE KEEP ALL THE KIDS HEALTHY. I AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REALITIES ARE PART OF EVERYONE'S LIVED EXPERIENCE -- SO EIGHT THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN TO YOU I THINK MANY OF US GOT A TASTE OF WHERE THIS IS GOING -- BUT IT BUT I DO THINK IT'S REQUIRES US TO HAVE THOUGHTFUL AND RESPECTFUL CONVERSATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND IF THAT'S OKAY WITH IT WITH IT WITH THE CHAIR -- COME WE TALK FIRST ABOUT IT AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND -- ALREADY ADDRESSED THE FAMILY HISTORY AND ALSO CITED WHERE IT IS MENTIONED IN IN THE LEGISLATION -- AS WELL AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE WILL -- WORD REVIEW AFTER FIVE EXEMPTIONS AS OPPOSED TO LIMIT. ON BOTH IN THE DICTIONARY THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND CERTAINLY A LAW THEY ALSO MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE CONCERNS -- ABOUT -- PRIVACY AND DATA I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OTHER. REGISTRIES OR OTHER FORMS OF DATA THAT'S COLLECTED AND GIVEN SOME EXAMPLES OF CAN YOU PLEASE ADDRESS THAT YES NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MARYLAND ON HEALTH TRY -- HEALTH PRIVACY IS SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME -- FIRSTLY AS WELL AS CERTAINLY THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AS WELL AS IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT ARE DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE MEDICAL BOARD. AND SAID AND I WOULD JUST WANNA POINT OUT THAT THE CURRENTLY THE MEDICAL BOARD ACCOUNT I MEAN THAT THIS CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH FIRST OF ALL MAINTAINS. DATABASES WITH VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION -- NOR TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH YEAH SO THOSE ARE PEOPLE WITH STDS AND HIV WE HAVE A CANCER REGISTRY WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES SO FOR PEOPLE ACTUALLY IMMUNIZE YOUR YOU'RE. YOU'RE IN THAT REGISTRY AND CERTAINLY. MY COLLEAGUE HERE IS THAT CAN HELP US RECORD FOR ASKING SPEAK TO OTHER -- DATA SETS AS WELL AND ALSO POINT OUT BY THE WAY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA ALSO MAINTAINS PRIVACY SO FOR EXAMPLE -- IN THEIR LAWSUIT AGAINST -- THE DOCTOR KENNEDY WE'RE TRYING TO OBTAIN MEDICAL RECORDS -- THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT WE WANT TO IN THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO PUBLISH THEM. WE NEED ACCESS IS A MEDICAL RECORDS IN ORDER TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AND IN FACT WE WILL KEEP THOSE RECORDS PRIVATE IT'S WE'LL KEEP THOSE RECORDS PRIVATE WHILE WE'RE DOING THE INVESTIGATION. AND THAT THEY THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ALSO IN THIS BILL WE EXPLICITLY STATE ALTHOUGH IT'S A CERTAINLY IMPLICIT READY BUT WE EXPLICITLY STATE. ALL STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS WILL HAVE TO BE OBEYED THAT WE THAT THAT NOTHING THEY CANNOT VIOLATE STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO. SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED IN THIS BILL WHILE ALLOWING US TO PERFORM OUR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION RIGHT. IS THAT OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC -- WE WANT TO KEEP IT TRY TO ACTUALLY DO IT. TO BE SURE THAT NO. GIVE PEOPLE AS MUCH FREEDOM AS THEY CAN BUT AT THE POINT WHERE YOU YOU SWING YOUR FIST AND YA IT SOME TOUCH SOMEONE'S NOSE-ACTUALLY GET THEIR NOSE. THEN THERE'S A PROBLEM RIGHT AND WE NEED TO BE SURE WE PROTECT ALL THE KIDS SO WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE INFORMATION TO DO THAT WHILE KEEPING INFORMATION PRIVATE. AS WELL AND THAT'S WHAT THE THIS BILL WILL DO AND THAT IS ACTUALLY THE WAY WE HANDLE THINGS HERE TAKE OUT FOR FOR OTHER ISSUES AS WELL THAT MAY INVOLVE THE MEDICAL BOARD A CALIFORNIA DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CAN YOU CLARIFY. WHAT TYPE OF EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS YOUR BILL APPLIES TO YOU? SO IT THE SO BASICALLY EXISTING LAW SAYS IT UP -- APPLY TO OF COURSE AT ALL K. THROUGH -- TWELVE SCHOOLS -- SO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE -- WE ALSO HAVE A RULES REGARDING -- CHILD CARE AS WELL IN TERMS OF SO WE DON'T CHANGE THAT BUT WHAT HAPPENS AND FACT THAT SAID INVOLVED IN TWO SEVEN SEVEN AS WELL. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THERE IS THIS -- MECHANISM FOR OVERSIGHT -- IF -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND IT DOES NOT APPLY TO HOME SCHOOL NO SO FRED FOR ACTUALLY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIES THAT ARE HOME SCHOOLING THEIR CHILDREN OR IF YOU'RE INDEPENDENT STUDY. IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL THIS IS NOT APPLY SO THERE'S NO EFFECT ON THOSE CHILDREN AND THOSE FAMILIES. AND THEN -- CAN YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT FLOATING OUT THERE WHETHER THIS GRANDFATHER'S OR DOZEN GRANDFATHER CURRENT EXEMPTIONS AND A AND I THINK PEOPLE USE GRANDFATHER IN DIFFERENT WAY BUT CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY THAT. SO WHAT WE'RE WHAT THE BILL SAYS IS THAT -- BY -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE NEED TO HAVE ALL MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ALL EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HAVE TO BE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CULT'S REMAIN BALLOT. OKAY SO THAT DOES INCLUDE THAT CONVENTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN GRANTED -- AND SO THAT THAT AND THEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT -- BASICALLY THE DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH FIRST OF ALL STARTING. TWENTY TWENTY ONE PHYSICIANS WILL HAVE TO APPLY FOR THEM BUT THEY CAN ALSO EXAMINED FOR ONLY THE SCHOOLS AND THE PHYSICIANS WITH THEIR TRIGGERS THEY CAN EXAMINE THOSE -- MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AS WELL -- THE FIRST IS THAT SINCE YOU HAVE THIS OKAY AND I I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED OF THE AUTHOR. I THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT -- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY -- BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A PIVOTAL POINT FOR A LOT OF YOUR INTERNAL ANALYSES ON WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE A CERTAIN WAY ON THIS BILL OR NOT. THE RELEVANT LANGUAGE OF TWO SEVENTY SIX AS AMENDED STATES THE DEPARTMENT MAY ACCEPT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- THAT IS BASED ON FAMILY HISTORY -- AS LONG AS THE DOCTOR PROVIDES WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE. IF WE WERE TRULY LEAVING THIS AT FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY. THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THAT LETTER CLAUSE. WE LIKE YOU WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL MEANT AND WE LIKE YOUWANT TO SENATOR PANS OFFICE YESTERDAY. AND WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED IS FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY GOING TO BE ALLOWED UNDER SB TWO SEVENTY SIX BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE NEW AMENDMENTS WERE -- THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM AND THEY WERE KIND OF FUN AND INTERESTING TO READ THROUGH. AND REPEATEDLY WHAT WAS TOLD BACK TO US IS IT WILL BE RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE. RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE DEFAULTS TO CDC GUIDELINES AND A SEVEN AND A. P. WHICH IF YOU HAVE READ THEM OR MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER SO THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THAT BILL. BASICALLY DOESN'T GET US ANYWHERE OTHER THAN CDC GUIDELINES AND CDC GUIDELINES DO NOT. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF VACCINES THAT THEY COVER. WHICH IS TO SAY IF WE VOTE THIS INTO A FACT. A CHILD WHO IS A SIBLING. OF A CHILD WHO DIED FROM A CERTIFIABLY PROVABLY DONE VACCINE REACTION BY THE VACCINE COURTS WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. TO MY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE. I SKIPPED HIGH SCHOOL I STARTED COLLEGE AT FOURTEEN I WAS ACCEPTED TO YALE LAW SCHOOL IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER OSS ON THE COUNTRY AT AGE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF. I REPRESENTED LARGE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES ASK THE QUESTION I I JUST I I WOULD LIKE TO STICK TO THAT QUESTION SO I APPRECIATE YOUR AND I REPRESENTED A PLANE WE SEE THEIR ANSWER AND I WOULD PLEASE. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR YES -- IF. THE COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE LATTER PART OF I KNOW I DIDN'T HEAR THAT IT WAS AMENDMENTS AND AMENDMENTS BUT I HEARD THAT IT WAS A CONCERN IF YOU COULD JUST REPLY. SO SO WE APPLY STANDARD OF CARE RIGHT SO OTHERWISE IF YOU DON'T HAVE STANDARD OF CARE THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT SO WHAT I KNOW WE ALL. WE ARE FAMILIES AND WE ALL HAVE FAMILY HISTORIES RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE A UNCLE WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD A HEART ATTACK YOU HAD ON TO DEVELOP CANCER YOU HAD A COUSIN WHO. SO. WE ALL HAVE FAMILY HISTORIES. AND EVEN PEOPLE ARE ADOPTED HAVE ONES THEY MAY NOT KNOW BE AWARE OF WE ALL HAVE FAMILY HISTORY SO IF YOU DON'T SAY STANDARD OF CARE. THAN JUST HAVING A FAMILY HISTORY THEN BECOMES A REASON FOR AN EXEMPTION. I MEAN WE APPLY STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVERYTHING SO IF YOU. SAY YOU HAVE A SYMPTOM OF SOMETING AND SO THE PHYSICIAN FOR EXAMPLE SAYS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID YOU HAVE A LITTLE YOU KNOW ACHE IN YOUR TOOTH. I'LL GIVE YOU A LARGE DOSE OF OPIOIDS AND THEN YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT PAIN YOU KNOW IS IS A REASON FOR THAT. AND I THINK WE WOULD SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE. THAT LEVEL PAYING ME NOT NESTLE WARRANTED AND SO WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY SAY STANDARD OF CARE IS A LITTLE BROAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S ESTABLISHED BY PHYSICIANS FOR EACH OTHER. AND LIKE WELL OKAY DOCTORS ARE TEND TO BE A LITTLE MORE FORGIVING OF EACH OTHER AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE LATITUDE BECAUSE GOT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS AT BECAUSE CLINICAL SITUATION SO. SO I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT BY ELIMINATING STANDARD OF CARE DOESN'T WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN THAT. IF YOU SIMPLY HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY YOU CAN EXEMPTION HI I THINK MOST OF US WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE -- TO TO DO THAT -- SO I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT BY THE WAY -- WELL CERTAINLY THE OPPONENTS -- HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE ACIP IN A P. VERY EACH OTHER I WOULD SAY THAT THERE YOU ARE STAFF LIST INDEPENDENTLY. DAVE HE EVALUATES THE DATA ON THEIR OWN ACHT EVALUATES THE DATA IF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SIMILAR PRIDE JUST SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE BUT HE'S POINTS TO THE SAME DIRECTION. AND ALSO IN THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY DON'T SAY IT'S JUST A C. I. T. AND A. P.. IT IS STANDARD CARE BY THE WAY THE REVIEW PANEL THE APPEALS PANEL FAXING PHYSICIANS IT'S PURELY STAND OF CARE BASICALLY -- IF THERE'S IF IT'S REASONABLE THE THINK THAT SOMETHING WITHIN REASON OF PER OF PHYSICIAN PRACTICING CALIFORNIA IS PRACTICING GOOD MEDICINE. ARE THESE RETAIL DECENT MEDICINE. THINKS IT'S OKAY THAT WOULD SET THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE SO IT THAT THAT'S ROUTE IT'S I THINK IT'S A VERY -- LIBERAL STANDARD ACTUALLY AND IS THAT STANDARD A STANDARD THAT IS APPLIED OR USE IN THIS CONTEXT OR OTHER CONTENTS EQUIVALENT TO THIS BY THE MEDICAL BOARD BY OUR STATE MEDICAL BOARD YES THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF RIGHT WHEN THEY EVALUATE DID A PHYSICIAN VIA YOU KNOW AT SHOULD BE PENALIZED. THEY CONSULT -- PHYSICIANS AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY BRING IN A POSITION BECAUSE ALL THEY SAY WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE NORMALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE NORMAL PRACTICE OF THE POSITION IN THAT FIELD. AND THAT'S THAT'S ALL THE MAKE THAT JUDGMENT WHETHER THEY WOULD PURSUE AFTER INVESTIGATION WILL BE PURSUE ANY PENALTIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. JOINING THEIR FROM AN OPPOSITION IS A PHYSICIAN ACTUAL NOW ACTUALLY IT'S UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE I NEVER WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE IN THE OPPOSITION IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY MATTER AND I THINK -- THAT WEEK WE HAD SOME COMMENTS. SO THIS TO RAMESES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ON THE FOR THE AUTHOR. ON TALKING AGAIN ABOUT THE FAMILY HISTORY WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN WITH A A CHILD NEWBORN TWO MONTH OLD -- IF THEY COME IN ARE THEY ASKED ABOUT THAT FAMILY HISTORY BEFORE THE IMMUNIZATIONS WERE FALSE. YES -- SO I USUALLY IF YOU HAVE A PLEASE. GIVE THE GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE THIS PLEASE NO NO APRS. YES AND IN FACT ACTUALLY I WOULD REFER YOU -- TO THE GUIDELINES THAT -- THE PUT OUT THE BRIGHT FUTURES GUIDELINES WHICH ARE ACTUALLY THE GUIDELINES FOR WELL CHILD CARE NOT THAT VACCINE SPECIFICALLY IT JUST ABOUT WELL CHILD CARE WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING AT YOUR TWO MONTH VISIT FOR MONTH VISIT. SIX MONTH VISIT -- TWO WEEK VISIT -- YOU'LL SEE AND THERE THAT THERE'S OF RIGHT DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING -- ASKING ABOUT THE FAMILY HISTORY -- SO THAT IS PART OF THE REGULAR WELL CHILD EXAM ACTUALLY IF YOU COME IN AND YOU HAVE A COLD THERE YOUR CHILD'S AND YOUR FACTION. WE WILL ALSO -- OFTEN INQUIRE ABOUT FAMILY HISTORY AS WELL YOU COME OF ASTHMA ATTACK WE WILL ASK ABOUT FAMILY IF YOU FOCUS ON THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT CERTAINLY GETTING A FAMILY HISTORY AND IF YOU WELL CHILD EXAM IT IS A MUCH BROADER FAMILY HISTORY. THAT WAS A CELL OKAY WHAT KIND CONDITIONS HAVE THE SIBLINGS HAD THE PARENTS HAD AUNTS AND UNCLES COUSINS GRANDPARENTS THAT IS PART OF OF NORMAL MEDICAL PRACTICE IN THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED PRIOR TO ANY IMMUNIZATIONS YES BEING CONDUCTED PLEASE SEND. IF THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON THAT WHAT IS THE RECOURSE OF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN IS OUR PROCESS FOR THEM TO FOLLOW OKAY SO I AM NOT SURE WE KEY ACTUALLY IF YOU APPRECIATE. WITH THE GUIDELINES OF OF US THERE. WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF QUESTIONS OF THE PARENTS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THAT HAVE SAID THAT. THEY WEREN'T ASKED ABOUT THAT HISTORY OF THE FAMILY PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION SO I JUST WANT TO GET CLEAR -- IS THERE A PROCESS FOR THAT FOR THE MEDICAL -- EXAM AND IF IT WASN'T FOLLOWED WHAT IS THE REQUEST FOR THE PARENTS ARE SET óRDENES AT THAT POINT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS OF VACCINATION -- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT RIGHT YOU BRING YOUR CHILD AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU BRING YOUR CHILD TO YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE RIGHT FOR THEIR EXAM. SOMETIMES YOU MAY EVEN FILL OUT AN INTAKE FORM THAT THE ONLY GO AND THE DOCTOR ASK USERS BUT HOW'S YOUR CHILD DOING WHERE THINGS ARE DOING OTHER CONDITIONS IN THE FAMILY THAT HAS TO BE DOCUMENTED BY THE WAY IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. THEY DO THE PHYSICAL EXAM RIGHT AND THEN THEY SAY OKAY THESE ARE SOME OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THINGS YOU SHOULD DO AND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VACCINATE RIGHT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THERE'S GOT THAT YOU ARE -- FOR THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT VACCINATION IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OF COURSE YOU CAN ASK THOSE QUESTIONS YOU GET THEM ANSWERED YOUR PROVIDED YOU ACTUALLY ROUTE MANDATED BY LAW TO PROVIDE A VACCINE INFORMATION SHEETS WHICH ACTUALLY CONTAINS ALL OF THE SIDE EFFECTS. OF THE VACCINE THE IDEA THE THINGS THAT THE VACCINE MAY CAUSE INCLUDING BY THE WAY DOES ALSO IT DOWN THERE AND NUMBER TO CALL IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS YOUR CHILD'S ALL THE VACCINE. THAT'S ACTUALLY PRINTED OFTEN THE VACCINE INFORMATION SHE WAS YOUR MANDATED BY LAW TO HAND OUT SO YOU DO YOU DO THAT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE YOUR CHILD. YOUR CHILD'S NOT VACCINATED THERE'S NO PHYSICIAN TO VACCINATE CHILDREN AGAINST THEIR PARENTS WELL SO THAT'S BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO CONSENT TO THE VACCINE IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS YOU DON'T WANT. TO YOUR CHILD DOESN'T GET VACCINATED AND FACT YOU HAVE TO SIGN THE THAT THE THE CONSENT BEFORE YOUR CHILD CAN YOU TAX NATIVE AND IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS OF COURSE YOU. TALK TO YOUR POSITION SAID WELL I I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY HAD SOME SORT OF EVENT THAT HAPPENED IS THERE GONNA BE A PROBLEM THAT BACK TO YOU HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN BOTH IMMENSELY IT'S APPARENT TO MAKES A DECISION. IN THE END WHETHER TO VACCINATE YOUR CHILD OR NOT BUT CERTAINLY. HEY THAT'S THE IDEA OF HAVING. A GOOD DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS IS THAT YOU'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN ABOUT WHY THEY WANT YOU TO GET YOUR CHILD VACCINATED WIRED TO RISKS OF THAT WORD OF BENEFITS OF THAT AND THAT IS PART OF THAT. THE DIALOGUE BEFORE YOUR CHILD GETS VACCINATED YOU ULTIMATELY IS THE PARENTS STILL MAKE THAT DECISION. WITH THE THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW. ELEVEN A CLARIFYING THAT PROCESS AND MISTER CHAIRS A FEW MORE QUESTIONS. ON IN PAGE TEN LINE THIRTY FIVE WOULD START TO TALK ABOUT -- EXEMPTIONS AND THE DENIAL THE REVOKING AND PENDING APPEAL. IT TALKS ABOUT A CHILD SHALL COMPLY WITH CONDITION EMISSIONS SCHEDULE FREE MUTATIONS. AND CONTINUED ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS DOES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF THERE'S AN APPEAL FOR AN EXISTING EXEMPTION. THAT THEY WOULD -- STUDENTS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN pBE IMMUNE IS -- IMMUNIZED IN ORDER TO STAY IN SCHOOL SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT -- YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE THE WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT SO LANDS OF YOU. GETS REJECTED YOU ASK FOR APPEALED APPEAL HAS TO HAPPEN THAT THE FUEL COMES BACK DOWN AND SAYS NO YOU'RE ACTED THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE AT THE ENROLLMENT LAWS. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO DO SO ALL RIGHT YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO DO SO SO YOUR CHILD CAN STILL ATTEND SCHOOL FOR ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS AFTER YOU'VE GOTTEN THE FINAL DECISION THAT AFTER THE PEEL. SO THAT NO POINT IN TIME UNTIL THE WHOLE PROCESS HAS GONE THROUGH. AND THEN YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS BEYOND THAT TO COMPLY -- TO REMAIN ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOL YOU CAN OF COURSE CERTAINLY CHOOSE TO INDEPENDENT STUDY YEARS CHILD YOU CAN CHOOSE. TO HOME SCHOOL YOUR CHILD IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO VACCINATE YOUR CHILD THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR CHILD WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ATTEND. THE SCHOOL -- YOU WILL NEED TO GET THEM -- CAUGHT UP ON THEIR VACCINES BY THE WAY WHAT YOU CAN GET A CONDITIONAL WHICH MEANS IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CHILD AND RECEIVE ANY VACCINES ARE INTERVALS BETWEEN VACCINE SO SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE A FAMILY MEMBER A FAMILY. YOU KNOW WAS TOO BUSY TO GET THE VACCINE DATA BECAUSE VACCINES AND THEY SAID OKAY I NEED TO CATCH THEM UP. SO YOUR CHILD AS SOON AS YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY IF THEY'RE CAUGHT UP AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BE NOT THEY'RE FULLY IMMUNIZED THEY CAN GO AND ATTEND SCHOOL AS A CONDITIONAL. ENTRANCE AND SO -- THAT'S ALL THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THAT THIRTY DAY PERIOD BEFORE THEIR CHILD CAN THEN CONTINUE IN SCHOOL AND STAY IN SCHOOL SO. DURING THE PROCESS UNABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL YES OUT YES AND TELL THE PROCESS IS ACTUALLY NOT SO GREAT STATE EXISTING THE COULD BE UP FOR SOME TIME TO REVIEW WILL BE ABLE. TO TO BE A ALL REMAIN AS THEY CAN REMAIN IN SCHOOL UNTIL THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS COMPLETED SO THEY CAN APPLY -- DECISION DATA FILE THAT THE PART OF THE HEALTH IS A VALUE IN THIS PART OF HEALTH. REJECT SAID THEY SUPPLY FOR THE APPEAL GUARD UNTIL THE APPEAL BOARD ITSELF IS DECIDED -- THEY CAN STAY IN SCHOOL AND THEN EVEN IF THE FUEL BOARD DANCE AS WELL THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE YOU THEN HAVE THIRTY DAYS BEYOND THAT POINT -- THE FOR YOU. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND ON PAGE -- TWELVE TALKS ABOUT THE CREATION OF THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT REVIEW PANEL -- WHEN WITHIN THAT EXPERT REVIEW PANEL -- BY THE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE STATE -- THOSE THAT WILL BE DECIDING WHO GETS ON THAT PANEL WILL COME DIRECTLY FROM THE SECRETARY OR FROM FROM WHERE WELL THEY JUST APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE PART OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND I WILL THOSE THAT. IT DIDN'T GO DEEPER INTO IN A AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY OFFICE EXPLAINED I KNOW WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- SO. BEING ABLE TO DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THAT EXPERT REVIEW PANEL IS SOLELY IN THE DISCRETION OF THE SECRETARY. OR IS THEIR QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE THAT WOULD BE ON THAT EXPERT PANEL FOR INSTANCE THOSE THAT HAVE ISSUED -- EXEMPTIONS THOSE THAT HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE CASES RIGHT TO HAVE SOME INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF IT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY VIEW MORE OF THAT DOCUMENTATION SO WHAT WE IT SAYS IS THAT SAID THEY HAVE THE THEY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE EITHER AS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WHICH IS WHO. WOULD NORMALLY BE IT GETTING EXEMPTIONS OR HAVE EXPERTISE AND AND VACCINES AND IN AND EFFECTS DISEASE WHICH IS OF COURSE WHAT VACCINES ABOUT PREVENTING SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME. EXPERTISE IN MEDICAL PRACTICE -- IN PRIMARY CARE ABOUT I DON'T THINK WE SPECIFY CARE OF CHILDREN BUT BUT WE SAY PRIMARY CARE BECAUSE THE AND AND ALSO -- KNOWLEDGE OF VACCINATION AND AND FIX THE SEASONS. WE WILL AT ANY POINT I KNOW IT'S STILL BEING WORKED ON BUT AT THAT POINT AS FAR AS EXPERTS -- BEING. THOSE ARE TO BE ON THAT PANEL WOULD THERE BE ANY -- CONSIDERATION TO PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION OF OF WHO MIGHT BE ON THAT EXPERT PANEL. SO I WOULD SAY IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S OPEN FOR DISCUSSION DOWN THE ROAD. WELL I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS IS A PEER REVIEW PANEL SO PEER REVIEW MEANS OTHER PHYSICIANS -- THAT'S USUALLY UP YOUR REVIEW WORKS AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT MAKING A JUDGMENT ABOUT. THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE VACCINIA VACCINE WHICH IS REALLY A IN MANY WAYS A PRACTICE TAKE A TECHNICAL ISSUE. LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE SO -- AND ALSO WHAT'S WITHIN THE RANGE OF NORMAL PRACTICE -- AND THAT'S HOW BY THE WAY THE MEDICAL BOARD WORKS THEY HAVE -- IF YOU'RE BEING INVESTIGATED THEY BRING IN PHYSICIANS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THAT MODE OF PRACTICE -- AT THAT TO TO REVIEW WHETHER -- THE MEDICAL PORTION PURSUE -- THAT CASE SO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT -- DOES IT WOULD BE ON THE PANEL WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE OF ISSUING EXEMPTIONS UNDERSTAND THAT HOPE YASIN'S CORRECT YES THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SENATOR PAT THANK YOU JIM. AS CHAIR WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIKE A RESPONSE FROM THE OPPOSITION. ONLY AT THE DISCRETION A MEMBER. GIVE ME DO YOU WISH THAT MR RAHMAN THE THROUGH THE AUTHOR -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE TERRIFYING POINTS TO ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE. EXCUSE ME PLEASE. WOULD YOU LOOK TO SOME OF THE THE PANEL DISCUSSION TO CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS I US THROUGH THE AUTHOR. OKAY SO BASICALLY EVERY TALK ABOUT THE ROUTE THE APPEALS PANEL. YES SO -- THE SET. IT CAN ACTUALLY CAN YOU REPEAT YOUR QUESTION I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'LL ANSWER EXACTLY WHAT THEY CONSIDER PAN. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM OPPOSITION OKAY WELL THAT IS A PARTICULAR ARE YEAH SOMEONE PARTICULARLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM MR RAHMAN. FOR THE MEDICAL HI I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE SECTION FIVE ABOUT THE APPEAL PROCESS. AND I CAN READ -- DEFINITIVE AN EXEMPTION IS PENDING APPEAL THE CHILD MUST COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONAL. ADMISSION SCHEDULE FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AND CONTINUED ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT MEANS. THE CHILD DOES HAVE TO CONTINUE VACCINATING WHILE THEY'RE EXEMPTION APPEAL PROCESS IS MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE IF I SEE A PATIENT IN MY OFFICE AND THE PATIENT HAS A SEIZURE AFTER VACCINATION. AND I DECIDE THAT CHILD SHOULD NOT GET ANY MORE DOSES OF THAT VACCINE. MORE DOSES MIGHT BE DO -- ONE OR TWO MONTHS LATER FOR THAT CHILD -- AND I WANT TO SUBMIT TO AN EXEMPTION TO SAY THAT EXEMPTION IS TO NINE AND GOES TO THE APPEAL PROCESS SAID APPEAL PROCESS TAKES MONTHS AND MONTHS SIX MONTHS A YEAR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE. THIS WILL REQUIRE ME TO CONTINUE VACCINATING THAT CHILD THE SAME VACCINE WHICH WAS BECAUSE THAT SEIZURE IN ORDER FOR THAT CHILD TO STAY IN SCHOOL. AND TO ME THAT IS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE NOR IS THAT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE PENDING OUR OUR CURRENT AMENDMENTS THAT'S NOT THE CASE. YEAH IS NOT THE CASE OKAY THANK YOU THINK HERE IN THE THE CLARIFICATION THROUGH THE AUTHOR THAT IT IS CLEAR A YES WITH A QUESTION. THAT THOSE THA ARE GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OF OF EITHER -- THE APPEAL PROCESS OR ANY THE PROCESS A SPELL IT OUT IN THIS -- LINE ITEM THAT YEAR THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PAGE. TEN THAT. THE STUDENT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SCHOOL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ANYMORE SACCHI VACCINATIONS DURING THAT TIME. THIS IS A PART AMENDMENTS THAT THAT THAT IS HAPPENING ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND THAT CONCLUDES BUT SOME MEMBERS CAN I RESPOND THAT FAMILY HISTORY LESSON LOSING MY QUESTION THANK YOU. VERY MUCH DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IF I MAY I WANTED TO ASK THE MEDICAL BOARD WHO I BELIEVE IS HERE IN ATTENDANCE. QUESTION BUT ONLY THROUGH YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M I'M SORRY I WAS I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD IF THE HOUSE OKAY. SORRY PANEL IN FRONT. PLEASE. I NOTICED YOU'RE A TWEENER EARLIER AND SO REALLY WANTED. TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS NOW OKAY HOW HAVE PHYSICIANS BEEN IN COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATIONS. RELATED TO IMMUNIZATIONS SO -- AS I STATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE WE ARE HAVING. ISSUES ITH LOOKING AT THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTION CASES BECAUSE I THINK A CENTER PAN MENTION THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PARENT IN ORDER TO GET THE RELEASE FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS. IN A CENTER PAN SAID THAT'S THE FIRST STEP IN OUR FOR SOME PROCESS. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE ANOTHER POSITION EXPERT LOOK AT THE MEDICAL RECORDS THE AND WHICH INCLUDES THE HISTORY AND AND THEY BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISION ON WHICH TO THAT CASE GO FOR FOR AN INVESTIGATION. IF WE CAN'T GET THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS WE DO HAVE ISSUES AND LOOKING AT THESE CASES HOW MANY INVESTIGATIONS HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE. ACTUALLY HAVE SOME STATISTICS WHERE DOES PULL NOT REALLY FAST. AND IF YOU CAN WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THOSE STATISTICS HOW MANY HAVE YOU BEEN UNABLE TO COMPLETE SO I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT CATEGORIES THAT WAY BUT I CAN GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION I HAVE SO -- WE HAVE RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE COMPLAINTS -- WE'VE TAKEN ONE ACTION THAT RESULTED IN PROBATION WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THREE INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING -- AND THE NUMBEROF COMPLAINTS CLOSED AS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS FORTY NINE AND SO THAT COULD BE FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A CATEGORIES THAT WE IN OUR SYSTEM SO COULD BE. THAT WE DIDN'T GET THE MEDICAL RECORDS WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE CASES IT COULD BE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT HIM AND OUR EXPERTS SAID THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. BUT THAT NUMBER IS FORTY NINE HOW LONG ON AVERAGE DOES ONE OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS THANK YOU I'M OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON AVERAGE AND THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE LIKE THE OTHER INVESTIGATION SO THEY CAN TAKE -- A YEAR A YEAR AND A HALF TO INVESTIGATE JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THE MEDICAL RECORDS WE HAVE TO DECIDE OF THAT NEEDS AN INVESTIGATION THEN IT GOES TO THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS AT DCA. WHAT A CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE STREAMLINED? THE PROCESS FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD SO THAT YOU CAN DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER YES IT WOULD AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SUPPORT IN THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US. TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS AND SO WE CAN LOOK INTO THESE CASES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIKE A RESPONSE [inaudible] MISTER MAY. THANK YOU A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO BUT ALSO TO OF SAY -- TO THE AUTHOR I IT IS INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE -- THAT YOU'VE HAD TO TAKE -- THE THE THE BRUISING -- THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE -- A FOR THOSE THAT ARE OF COURSE -- LET EVEN SAYING THAT THE THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM -- THEY WHAT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW IS I ACTUALLY I DO NOT SUPPORT SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS -- ONE I WILL TELL YOU A THAT AND I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE AND IN PUBLIC OFFICE EVER. BEEN INSULTED BY SOMEONE THEY GOT ME WANTED IT TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS -- IF SOMEBODY WAS OPPOSING ME IN A CONSULTING IT USUALLY MOVE ME IN THE OTHER DIRECTION SO -- I THINK IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD WE HAVE SOME OF THIS THIS BEHAVIOR AND YOU HAD TO TAKE AN AWFUL AN AWFUL LOT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSEVERANCE ON THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO. THAT YOU DO BELIEVE AND GIVE. DO YOU HAVE A A QUESTION -- IN REGARDS. TO THIS IDEA OF A ONE DOCTOR ONLY BE ABLE TO HAVE FIVE EXEMPTIONS. I HAD SPOKEN EARLIER TODAY WITH A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE -- AND THEY HAD -- A LITTLE A LITTLE BABY GIRL -- THAT WENT AND GOT -- AN MMR VACCINATION AND OF AND VERY NEXT DAY -- THERE IS A RASH THAT DEVELOPED -- AND THAT RASH STATE -- FOR A LITTLE OVER OVER A YEAR. AND SO THEY SOUGHT OUT -- BUT THEY WERE ALL THIS AND VERY SCARED -- DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK GOT ONLINE STARTED DIGGING UP A BUNCH OF INFORMATION AND THEN ONE OUT AND SOUGHT OUT A DOCTOR -- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- THEM -- SOME SOME GUIDANCE AND SO IF YOU'RE SEEKING EIGHT A DOCTOR WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ON THESE ISSUES AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE. ARE SOME BAD DOCTORS BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME GOOD DOCTORS AS WELL WHO SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME. ON THIS ISSUE AND IF THAT ONE GOOD DOCTOR WHO'S BECOME AN EXPERT IN THESE ISSUES WHY WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE. OF FOR THEM TO WRITE MORE THAN FIVE OR FOR THAT MATTER ON THE BE AT RISK OF FOR TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY HUNDREDS OF THESE BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN EVEN EXPERT THERE'S GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE GOING TO SEE SEEK THEM OUT WHY WOULD THAT BE UNACCEPTABLE. WHAT FIRST OF ALL I POINT OUT THAT THE FIVE IS NOT A CAP? IT'S A TRIGGER FOR EXAMINATION RIGHT SO IT'S NOT A CAP -- IT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU SO IF YOU ARE AN AS AT POINT OUT EXAMPLE MIGHT BE AN ECOLOGIST OR YOUR SONY TAKES A LOT TRANSPLANT PATIENTS RIGHT. YOUR TO FROLIC JUST AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF KIDS OF KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS CORRECT AND AND MAYBE BECAUSE THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH YOU IT'S JUST EASIER TO ASK YOU ARE YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE THE ONE TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF I THINK YOU NEED. TO HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FACT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT MOST OF THE TIME. YOU SHOULD IT'S USUALLY THE DOCTOR WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THE PATIENT IS AS YOU WELL YOU HAVE A CONDITION I DON'T THINK YOU CHARGING GET THE VACCINE THAT WHICH MEANS THEN I SHOULD GIVE YOU MEDICAL SENSE AND NOT THE PARENT GOING -- I WANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND ACTUALLY WHERE OF PHYSICIANS TAKING CARE OF A CHILD TO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I CONCERNED WHETHER A VACCINE WOULD BE. YOU KNOW THE BEST THING FOR YOUR CHILD THEREFORE I I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU NOT GET THE VACCINES AND I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT YEAH SUBMIT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT -- IS IT ANY PHYSICIAN HIS WRITING APPROPRIATE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HAS NOTHING TO FEAR. BECAUSE THAT FIVE TO SIMPLY FOR EXAMINATION WE WANTED TO BE MORE TARGETED THAT'S WHY WE PICKED THE FIVE BUT THE BASICALLY IF THE THIS IS A LEGITIMATE YOU'VE JUSTIFY THE REASON -- THEN -- WE'VE APPROVED AND WAS APPROVED THERE'S NO NO ISSUE IT'S THAT IF YOU'RE SUBMITTING NUMEROUS EXEMPTIONS. THAT ARE SUSPECT AND THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND BOTH ALL THE REVIEW SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REJECTING THIS ONE REJECTING ANOTHER ONE REJECTING ANOTHER. ONE THEN THAT LEADS TO GREATER THAN THAT LEADS TO AN ISSUE SO ITS ROUTE SO THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT PART RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WE WANT -- TO BE SURE THAT WERE -- BE SHOULD BE SURE THAT THE PERSON EXERCISING RESPONSIBILITY BY THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE PROOF SHOWS A SUBMIT THEM OF THEIR EXAMINED AND THOSE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE THEY CAN WRITE AS MANY AS THEY WATCHED. THERE'S NO CAP IT SIMPLY SAYS IF YOU WRITE MORE AND FIVE IN THE YEAR YOUR SUBJECT -- TO SOME ADDITIONAL SKILLED YEAH I WAS WITH YOUR SAID THAT THAT THE EXEMPTION ITSELF ACTUALLY IS IT. SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY YOU'RE NOT LESS YOU'VE BEEN WRITING A LOT OF THE ONES THAT BEEN REJECTED. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- THE EVEN A COLLEGE JUST -- WHO MAY END UP WRITING MORE FIVE IN A YEAR DESPITE NOT GONNA WRITE HUNDREDS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY TAKING CARE THAT MANY PATIENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM BUT THAT AGAIN DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE? THANK YOU KNOW IF -- MISTER ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO ASK DOCTOR SEARS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK DOCTOR SEARS MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE -- DOCTORS THAT PEOPLE UP C. SEEK OUT -- AND US SO WELL. YOU KNOW BUT WE CAN SPEAK TO THAT. YES I'M MY MY CONCERN IS CALLED TELL YOU GUYS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING UNDER SP TWO SEVEN SEVEN FOR THREE FOUR YEARS NOW. WHEN I SEE A CHILD WITH A SEVERE VACCINE REACTION? THAT'S NOT A CUT CDC GUIDELINES BUT IT'S SOMETHING NOT ME -- IMMEDIATELY LIFE THREATENING SUCH AS A SEIZURE OR IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE CHILD WHO DEVELOPED CHRONIC EXAM A RASH AFTER MMR VACCINE FOR SOMEONE AT A TEMPORARY NERVE INJURY AFTER VACCINATION. NONE OF THOSE ARE CDC GUIDELINES TO TO STOP ACTIVATION BUT UNDER SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHEN I WAS UP TO MY JUDGMENT AS A DOCTOR I CAN JUDGE. THAT CHILD SHOULDN'T GET MORE DOSES OF THAT VACCINE SO THAT I CAN DECIDE THAT THAT CHILD TO BE EXACT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S FAIR AND I WOULD. I WOULD IMAGINE A LOT OF YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO GIVE YOUR CHILD MORE DOSES OF THE VACCINE IF THEY HAD A SEIZURE. OR NERVOUS IN JURY OR SEVERE EXAM OR ANY OTHER KINDS OF DOZENS OF OTHER SEVERE REACTIONS SO THAT'S ALL UNDER SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND THAT'S TIME PRACTICING NOW. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERY EXEMPTION I'VE EVER DONE UNDER THOSE GUIDELINES WHICH ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO CDC COUNTRY NEGATIONS. UNDER THOSE ALL GUIDELINES THEY CAN NOW REVIEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY EXEMPTIONS OF TIME AND JUST QUALIFY EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM. AND KICK THOSE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL THEY'RE SORT OF RETRO ACTIVELY CHANGING THE GUIDELINES ALL THE EXAMPLES I'VE EVER DONE AND OTHER POSITIONS OF EVER DONE. AND TO ME THAT'S A VERY VERY CONCERNING PRECEDENT FOR GOVERNMENT TO GO BACK LIKE THAT AND THE GATE YEARS OF MEDICAL CARE THAT'S BEEN DONE. LEGALLY AND PROPERLY UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN SO IT IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH LEAST FROM. SOME OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA -- AND THAT THAT IS PUBLIC RECORDS PEOPLE POSTED THAT THERE ARE SOME DOCTORS -- WHO ARE -- A TAKING MONEY AND WRITING MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEARLY IS THE PUBLISHER OF HAVE DISCLOSED THAT. AM I AM AND MY SENSE IS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO SOLVE A FOR OUR OUR OUR SOME UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE A CHECK -- TO RIDE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BECAUSE THAT -- THAT THAT WAS. NOT THE POINT OF OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN SO HOW DO WE CREATE THEN A NEW RULE OR NEW STANDARD AND I'M GONNA HAVE DOCTORS YEARS ANSWER THIS ALL COME BACK TO THAT THE AUTHOR THEN. HOW DO WE CREATE A STANDARD NO THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE SOME DOCTORS THAT ARE NOT DOING THIS -- JUST OF FOR A PROFIT MAKING SCHEME -- AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SOLVE FOR THAT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I DO PERSONALLY AS I CHARGE. THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR PATIENTS WHO I SEE FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AS I DO FOR NEW PATIENTS COMING IN TO ME FOR A CHECK UP. OR CONSULTATION I DON'T CHARGE ANYMORE IN FACT MY MEDICAL EXEMPTION APPOINTMENTS ACTUALLY TWO APPOINTMENTS I'M I DON'T MAKE ANY MORE MONEY FROM DOING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BY MINUTES ANYTHING ELSE. SO THAT'S THAT'S ALL I DO I CAN ESOS SPEAK TO A TUNE US OR WHATEVER OTHER DOCTORS DO I'M JUST SAYING. I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING THIS IN A VERY SCRUPULOUS WAY I DO NOT ADVERTISE FORT I DON'T ADVERTISE ON SOCIAL MEDIA I DON'T EVEN HAVE A WEST SO I'M GONNA MAKE THE ASSUMPTION AND ASK YOU I'M GONNA MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU'RE A GREAT DOCTOR AND YOU DO A GOOD. WORK AND THE TH THE THE THAT YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE DOING IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING MONEY. LET'S MAKE THAT THIS JUST AT THE ASSUME THAT THERE ARE BECAUSE I THINK IN FACT I'M I'M PRETTY SURE LEASE FROM SOME OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S SOME DOCTORS ARE DOING THIS JUST MAKING MONEY. HOW FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE -- HOW WOULD YOU PUT TOGETHER SOME GUIDELINES OR HOW WOULD YOU COME UP WITH SOME RULES STATE LAW TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE FOR THAT? HERE AND I NOTICED THE THE SENATOR OR DO YOU HOW DO A LITTLE BIT OF LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TOWARDS THAT WERE THERE NOT ALLOW YOU TO CHARGE EXTRA FOR FOLLOW UP EXAMS ETCETERA. I MEAN IF THE I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS BUT THE STATE CERTAINLY IT'S IN YOUR PURVIEW IN THIS LAW -- TO CREATE SOME SORT OF GUIDELINES WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OVER CHARGE. FOR NOT ALLOWED TO BE UNSCRUPULOUS WITH THEIR WITH THEIR BILLING I KNOW I'M NOT AND YOU CERTAINLY COULD WORK THAT A NOT ENOUGH UNISOURCE SOME SORT OF PRICE LIMIT OR YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE KIND OF UP TO YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND WILL SPEND BUT I DO WANT TO SAY. ALONG THOSE LINES IS A PEDIATRICIAN I'M FULL AND BUSY LIKE EVERY DAY I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THESE EXEMPTIONS I'M FULL JUST DOING CHECK UPS. AND SICK VISITS SO WHY WOULD I RISK MY LICENSE TO JUST START DOING YOUR TIME THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S WHEN I I DON'T ME I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED THE EXTRA BUSINESS. AND THERE TO SERVE THESE FAMILIES WERE BAD SEVERE REACTIONS KICKED OUT OF THEIR OWN DOCTORS OFFICE AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO COME LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY LIKE YOU SAID IS AN EXPERT. ON THAT SO THANK YOU FOR THE REST RIGHT LOOK IN IN AND BACK THAT POINT I WASN'T MAKING IS SOMETHING THAT WAS YOUR CASE I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME DOCTORS. AND I ALSO THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THE THAT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THIS ISSUES AND FORTUNATELY THERE ARE THAT THEIR THEIR REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SOME DOCTORS THAT ARE -- THAT THAT THAT ARE -- USING THIS IS A PROFIT MAKING SCHEME I MEAN IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THE EVIDENCE. AND THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TO LOOK INTO THAT AND INVESTIGATE DOCTORS BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL PRACTICES THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE STOP. THEY COULD TAKE A YOU'RE RIGHT YOU COULD ALSO CREATE GUIDELINES FOR US THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW RIGHT. DR THANK YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A SEARCH TO HEAR YOU SAY YOUR FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE ARE ESTABLISHING IN THIS -- BELL GUIDELINES -- FOR OVERSIGHT -- WE'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD ABOUT THEIR CHALLENGES I WOULD POINT OUT THAT TO ACTUALLY THE ONE PERSON MEDICAL BOARD HAS -- ACTUALLY PUT ON PROBATION FOR IN A PROBABLY MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS DOCTOR SEARS HIMSELF IS HERE. THE THE MAN HERE HE'S ALSO PUT HE'S USED TO HAVE A LIST OF CODE VACCINE FAMILY PHYSICIANS ON HIS WEBSITE HE SINCE TAKEN IT DOWN -- SO -- HE SO HE'S BEEN HI IT HEAVILY INVOLVED IN. IT AND ACTUALLY THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY -- AND SO I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT HE'S THE ONE WHO'S A TRYING TO SAY THAT WELL YOU CAN LOOK AT FINANCIAL OR WHATEVER ELSE. BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IS AS WE APPLY STANDARDS RIGHT WE'RE GONNA HAVE STANDARDS AND BY THE WAY THE STAND IS GONNA BE THE FIND. BY SCIENCE THE EVIDENCE AND WHAT IS. NORMAL MEDICAL PRACTICE RIGHT THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT THE STANDARDS WE ESTABLISHED SO WE CREATE YEAH WE CREATE SOME LATITUDE. THERE. STANDARD OF CARE RIGHT IS THAT SOMETHING A NORMAL -- PHYSICIAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED WITH EXPECT EXPECTED TO DO IS THAT WITHIN THIS THE DISCO WAS THAT IS THAT WITHIN THE QUALITY STANDARDS THE EVIDENCE. SO FORTH AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE SAYING THAT YOU NEED TO MEET THE BASICALLY THE SMELL TEST YOUR EXEMPTION. WOULD NEED TO MEET THAT SMELL WELL THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT APPROPRIATE -- THAT IS AND DON'T GET KEEP IN MIND THIS IS SCISSION TO GRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO VITALLY AGAIN OF ONE EMPHASIZED -- YOU CAN STILL YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO VACCINATE YOUR CHILD OR NOT. THAT'S YOUR DECISION THERE IS NO FOUR SAKS NATION. RIGHT THERE IS A CONSEQUENCE TO THAT. THE CONSEQUENCES NOT TO PENALIZE THE CHILD IS NOT VACCINATED THEIR FAMILY THE CONSEQUENCES ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE SCHOOL WHICH THEY'RE TENDING. AND THAT THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS BILL. IS NOT TO GET DOCTOR BOB SEARS AS MUCH AS HE MIGHT DISAGREE. IT'S REALLY TO BE SURE THE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE SO IN FACT I JUST MENTIONED IN MY OPENING WE HAVE THE SAN JOSE MERCURY LOOKED AT EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND FOUND THAT. FIVE POSITIONS ARE WRITING OVER HALF OF ALL THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SAN DIEGO ONE PHYSICIAN ROAD ALMOST A THIRD BY LATE DOCTORS YEARS OF PRACTICE DOWN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WROTE WHEN AN EXEMPTION. AFTER YOU GUYS PROBATION UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO EIGHT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THE STANDARD AGAIN YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. WE'RE NOT SAYING IT'S AUTOMAT IT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT ALL OF YOU RIGHT MORE THAN FIVE THAT THEREFORE WE REJECT ALL EXEMPTIONS WE JUST SAY THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THEM BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE REALLY. WE HELP THE NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP THE KIDS SAFE AT SCHOOL SOMEONE A CHILD ATTEND SCHOOL THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL IF THEY HAVE A GENUINE. WITH A GENUINE MEDICAL CENTER THEM IS THEY'RE NOT VACCINATED THEY NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN THEIR KIDS AND THEIR THE OTHER KIDS IN YOUR SCHOOL. WHO CAN BE VACCINATED ARE SO THEY CAN STAY SAFE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT? AND JUST OF THE FOLLOW UP IS THERE SOME OTHER BACK TO THIS IDEA OF A SPECIALIST IN THIS -- COULD THERE BE SOME OTHER. STANDARD IN WHICH BY A SPECIALIST -- COULD DO MORE OF THESE -- SURE YES. I I THINK THAT IF I WOULD SAY IS THAT SO WHAT SOME THE THINGS WE CRAFT. NO NO NO YOU TO PLEASE. YEAH SO WHERE THINGS HERE WE WE CRAFTED THIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE AGAIN TO HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF -- SO WHAT -- EXCUSE ONE THE CHANGES TO THE BILL -- AT THE REQUEST OF THE ASSEMBLY INSTANTLY I AGREE IS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN WHO'S NOT THE NORMAL SAYS THE OTHER NOR THE REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN FOR THAT CHILD. RIGHT AND YOU'RE SUBMITTING AN EXEMPTION THAT -- WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO TEST WITH YOU ARE THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR NOT IF YOU'RE NOT THEN YOU HAVE TO I SEE NOTIFY THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SO THEY'RE AWARE THAT YOUR NOW PLAYING FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR A CHILD THAT THERE'S A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. FOR RIGHT. WE ALSO HAVE TO TEST YOU ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE CHILD -- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- THAT COMES UP AS WE FOR THE WE KNOW THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GRANTED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS SIMPLY THROUGH AN INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING ONLINE THAT THEY'VE NEVER EXAMINED THE CHILD -- IF YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ON GOING RELATIONSHIP AS WELL SO I MEAN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE ASSEMBLY ASK FOR THAT -- I AGREE WITH BECAUSE WHEN WE PASSED TWO SEVEN SEVEN AGAIN AS I MENTIONED WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION. BUT WHAT WE OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR CHILD'S REGULAR DOCTOR WHO KNOWS THE CHILD HE'S GRANTING THEM AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IS THAT. ACTUALLY WE HAVE PHYSICIANS AND OF THE MEDICAL WORDS THAT'S THE CASE YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN AND ANTI AGING CLINIC -- DOESN'T REALLY TAKE YOUR PEDIATRICS WHO IS WRITING A LOT OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE MEDICAL WORTH LOOKING INTO THAT WE SAW IN SAN DIEGO YOUR PHYSICIANS WHO DON'T NORMALLY TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN I KNOW DOCTOR SEARS HIMSELF AS A PEDIATRICIAN. BUT WE HAVE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE NOT REALLY THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR AND YEAH I THINK THIS IDEA OF HAVING MEDICAL EXEMPTION VISITS KIND OF INTRIGUING BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T REALLY HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION VISITS YOU EITHER YOUR DOCTOR YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR DOCTOR YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM YOU HAVE. THAT RELATIONSHIP AND IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH VACCINES DO YOU RECKON THE EXEMPTION THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT SUPPOSED TO NORMALLY HAPPEN PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE GOING OUT FINE THE OTHER DOCTORS FOR EXEMPTIONS IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE A SPECIALIST. AND THEY THINK YOU CAN'T GET VACCINATED SAFELY THEN THE THERE SOME OF THE EXEMPTION UNTIL YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR BY THE WAY. THAT CHAO'S INACTIVE VACCINATED WE SHOULD GET AN EXEMPTION THAT'S HOW SHOULD NORMALLY WORK. THANK YOU DR GRANT THANK. SURE OF COURSE MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I HAVE SOME SOME THOUGHTS IN JUST ONE QUESTION FOR DOCTOR PAN BUT BUT BEFORE WE GET THERE -- I DID APPRECIATE THE DEBATE AND AND FRANKLY THERE WERE A LOT OF THOUGHT FULL PARTICIPANTS PRETTY MUCH ALL ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE ON THE BILL -- THEIR WORST MAINLY SINCERE -- WELL IN THE STORM YEAH VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT MANY FROM MY DISTRICT HERE IN DISTRICT SEVEN OF COURSE. THE WORST TIME WHO HAD SOME PERSONAL ATTACKS ON YOU WHICH I FIND VERY TROUBLING AND DISTURBING AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP MAKE THE CASE FOR THEM TO TO GO AGAINST THIS BILL SO. I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN CONDEMNING THAT AND I JUST WANTED. FOR THOSE OF YOU. DATA. THE QUESTION DOCTOR PAN IN HIS BELIEFS BEFORE DOCTOR PAN. WAS THAT SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BEFORE I WAS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HOUSING COUNCILMEMBER HERE FOR TEN YEARS AND MY TEN YEARS ONLY ONE PEDIATRICIAN EVER KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND SAID HEY. HOW CAN I HELP KIDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD GET HEALTHCARE FOR KIDS LOVE ACCESS TO CARE SO I KNOW? IN YOUR HEART WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT AND PUBLIC HEALTH ACCESS TO CARE MAKING SURE THAT KIDS GROW UP HEALTHY SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THAT'S NOT THE BILL RAY BYE SO NO THAT. IS -- IS IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO REFLECT AS FAR AS YOUR LEGACY IN OUR COMMUNITY SO SO WITH THAT I DID VOE. FOR FOR TWO SEVEN SEVEN BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE PERSONAL -- PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION. WAS -- WAS FLAWED PUBLIC POLICY WASN'T BASED ON SCIENCE PER SE WE WENT TO THIS -- THIS IS SCIENCE DRIVEN THING BASED UPON YOUR YOUR YOUR DOCTOR AND I GET THAT. AND AS MR MAYES -- COLLUDED TO KINDA LIKE WE SAW ON THE AND THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. FIELD LAST YEAR'S. PEOPLE HAD A BACK ACHE A TOE INJURY THEY CAN GO GET SOMEBODY TO WRITE WHATEVER THEY WANTED. AND AND EVEN THE THE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SINCERELY BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE THIS. DOCTOR INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP BASED UPON. HEALTH AND SCIENCE THAT THEY PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME SAMPLES THAT JUST -- DON'T MAKE SENSE AND THAT REALLY ARE FRAUDULENT. AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND YOUR YOUR BILL HERE FIRST EFFORT YOU TRY -- TO ADDRESS THAT -- I WOULD SAY SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT YOU MAY WANT TO FARM YOUR FIRST DRAFT AND I DID HAVE SOME SOME MEETINGS AND SOME CONCERNS THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND AND APPRECIATE THE CHANGES THAT YOU PUT FOR THAT. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE BUT FOR THE GOVERNOR BEFORE -- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA RE SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY ABOUT THIS BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE TO TALK WITH THIS THE BIG PICTURE. THAT THAT WILL WHERE YOU STARTED. AND THE CONCERNS THE MAIN CONCERNS OF I HEARD PEOPLE COMING IN MY OFFICE SAYING. THE CDC POLICY IS TOO NARROW IT'S TOO NARROW. AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THAT WE SHOULD -- BROADENED THE SCOPE TO MAKE SURE THAT TRUE. MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM ONCE DOCTOR NOT DOCTOR SHOPPING DOCTOR BUT A TRUE DOCTOR CAN EVALUATE AND CAN PROVIDE TO THE STATE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE APPROVED. SO IF YOU WOULD GIVE. US ONE MORE CHANCE TO OUTLINE HOW YOU THINK THAT. THAT THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE VERSION BEFORE US TODAY YES. SO AGAIN WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS THAT -- CERTAINLY REFERS TO A SAID A C. I. P. C. C. WHICH IS AN EVIDENCE BASED. APPROACH IT ALSO HAS THE AMERICAN CAB PEDIATRICS WHICH IS A NON GOVERNMENTAL IT'S PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY. INDEPENDENT EVALUATION -- AND THEN WE ALSO STATE STANDARD OF CARE WHICH MEANS THAT IS IF THAT'S SOMETHING RECENTLY DONE BY PHYSICIAN AND CALIFORNIA ARE IN THAT COMMUNITY. THEN THAT WOULD BE SIR VALID. AND I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS WHY KEEP KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL. AND IN FACT THE REASON WE'RE DOING IT TARGET APPROACH -- WHICH WAS ON REGIONAL BILL BUT I CERTAINLY WAS AGREEABLE TO THAT -- FOR BOTH -- THE GOVERNOR AND FROM -- THIS ASSEMBLY IS IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS SAY NO WE WANT YOUR KIDS ARE SAFE AT SCHOOL SO THE SCHOOL IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD. YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT EXEMPTION MIGHT NOT BE VALID OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SCHOOL SAFE -- THE KIDS WHO HAVE THE EXEMPTIONS WHO NEED EXEMPTION STILL BE OKAY RIGHT THERE'S A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL OF PROTECTION. BUT IF IT DROPS BELOW THAT. WELL WE KNOW THERE'S SOME KIDS WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE EXEMPTIONS AND WE NEED TO KEEP THEM SAFE RIGHT AND SO THE KIDS WHO HAVE A LEGEND EXEMPTIONS WE NEED TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND SO WE GOT LOOK AT WELL WHO ALSO HAVE EXEMPTIONS AND SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE IT. WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T KEEP THEM BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY ENDANGERING THE ONES WHO REALLY NEED IT NOW I ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- THE IDEA IS IS THAT. WHEN WE SAY STANDARD OF CARE AND AND WHAT'S REASONABLE FOR A POSITION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO SAY THAT WILL? DILATES NOT ABOUT PROVING -- THE THE SAYING THAT -- YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE VACCINE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM RIGHT SO SOMETHING HAPPENED RELATED AND YOU THINK IT'S RELATED ACCEDE. YEAH IT IT'S NOT ABOUT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE VACCINE CAUSED IT I THINK IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT SAYING WELL IF YOU HAVE A CONDITION. AND LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AND IF WE CAN SAY THAT THAT ACTUALLY CONDITIONS BEEN CAUSED BY SOMETHING ELSE NOT THE VACCINE WE SHOULD ACCEPT THAT. OR IF WE'VE ACTUALLY DISPROVED THAT THE VACCINE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION. THE THAT WE CAN'T DISPROVE VACCINE DIDN'T BECAUSE IT. OF ANY WE CAN'T PROVE THE VACCINE DIDN'T BECAUSE IT OR WE CAN'T PROVE THAT THE THING THAT HAPPENED HAD SOMETHING THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS DUE TO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFICALLY NOT THE VACCINE. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT MAYBE IT COULD BE THE VACCINE THEN WE'D PROBABLY SAY OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT. LET'S LET'S GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT THE DOWN SAY IT COULD BE THE VACCINE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS BUT LET'S GIVE THE BENEFIT DOWN SAID SO MUCH TO GET THE THEIR EXEMPTION. BECAUSE WE KEEP WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT WHAT REALLY BECAUSE IT AND THAT IT'S IT AND WE CAN'T THIS PROVES THE VACCINE AND WE CAN'T PROVE IT SOMETHING ELSE. SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A SEIZURE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF GETTING THE THE FEAR TETANUS PROTEST THIS VACCINE -- ACTUALLY IT THE I LIKE THIS IS WITHIN THE CDC GUIDELINES I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW A LITTLE BEYOND BUT EVEN THE CDC GUIDELINES OR TERMS IS TOO NARROW ACTUALLY SAYS IF YOU GET A SEIZURE -- YOU KNOW PROLONGED SEIZURE AFTER YOU RECEIVE THAT VACCINATION WITHIN SIX DAYS WE CAN'T SHOW IT'S CAUSED BY SOMETHING ELSE LIKE I THAT IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID YOUR NECK THAT'S A MASON FROM THE NO IT DOESN'T COUNT IF WE CAN SAYIT'S ACTUALLY CAUSED BY SOMETHING IT'S NOT THE VACCINE. THEN OF COURSE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT REALLY TO THE VACCINE BUT WE CAN'T SAY DOUBTS. THEN. YOU'D QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION UNDER THE CDC GUIDELINES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COSTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE VACCINE BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT [inaudible] EXEMPTION. NO MORE DETACHED YOU'RE DONE EXEMPTION ON THAT VACCINE SO -- SO THAT IS THE WAY THAT -- THIS THIS WORKS WE WHAT WE WANT TO GIVE AS MUCH LATITUDE AS POSSIBLE WHILE STILL BEING SURE RECOGNIZED WITH EVERY EXEMPTION WE GIVE. WE ALSO WEAKENING THE COMEDIAN UNITY IN THE SCHOOL AND THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS WE'RE AS LONG AS WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT FIRST PRIORITY IS TO BE SURE WE KEEP THAT CHILD SAFE AND THEN BE SURE WE KEEP THE SCHOOL SAFE SO THERE'S ANY CONCERN. THE VACCINE MIGHT BE WHAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM EVEN IF WE CAN'T PROVE IT. OKAY LET'S GIVE THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION BUT IF WE CAN SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE VACCINE THAT WE KNOW ITS -- THEN ITHINK WOULD HAVE TO SAY SO A OCT WE HEARD A COUPLE PEOPLE SAY AUTISM. ALRIGHT WE'VE HEARD A COUPLE PEOPLE TESTIFY AND SAY AUTISM AND BUT THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO SHOW THERE'S NO SAYS HE ASIAN BETWEEN VACCINES AND AUTISM. VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM RIGHT THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS STUDIES IS THAT IT TO THE ALL THE INTO THE PRESENT THAT SHOWS THAT. SOME PEOPLE MAY STILL WANT TO SEE HIM WITH HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY PAUL MIGHT YOU KNOW I HAVE I AM A CHILD IS AUTISM SOME RELATIVE HAS AUTISM WE WANTED EXEMPTION. I I THINK YOU KNOW TO BE LET'S BE REALLY DIRECT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT WE'VE THAT'S BEEN STUDIED AND BEEN EXAMINED. NOW THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AND WE SHOULD GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT WHEN WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT THAT WE DO NOW. WE NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE. WOULD YOU LIKE A RESPONSE FROM THE OPPOSITION ON A POINT YES. AND THAT I JUST HAVE. ONE MORE QUESTION ON CLOSING COMMENT. FOR YOU DR GRANT THAT SO I THINK SO MEMBER LIMóN ACCESS AN HOUR AGO AND THAT AND I CAN HEAR YOUR ANSWER BUT MAYBE -- MAYBE TWO IF YOU COULD HELP US GOING TODAY AND GOING FORWARD -- WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS WITH WITH -- BASIC MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS GOING BACK. OTHER WORDS IT THERE'S GET THROWN OUT THERE THAT ONLY POINT AND THERE'S THAT 1% THRESHOLD AS FAR AS RESULT. IS THERE IS THERE IS THERE A NEED TO GO BACK AND IS THAT YOUR INTENTION. TO CHAT GOING BACK OR AS A GOING FOR POLICY SO SO I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE THE ONE OF CONCERNS. THAT -- BROUGHT ABOUT THIS BILL OF COURSE AGAIN WORD THE FACE OF THE LARGEST MEASLES -- CAN NEVER CASES AND OVER AQUARTER CENTURY BUT ALSO WE SAW THE MEDIC EXEMPTION RATE. YEAH BASICALLY QUADRUPLED NOW -- SO I IS AS I MENTIONED TO SOME OF THE SOME OF YOU IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS I AM CERTAINLY OPEN TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT POINT DID HOW FAR BACK DO WE LOOK RIGHT -- PROBABLY -- VERY FEW -- OP PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WHEN THEY COULD GET A PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION SO WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO GO Vì FOR THE INVITATION. TO SEVEN SEVEN BUT WE MAY ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW IN THE BEGINNING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH SO WE MAY NOT NEED NEED TO GO BACK AS FAR. I I I LOOK WELCOME THAT CONVERSATIONWE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT. AND SO THAT'S A CONCERN I'D CERTAINLY BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH -- THAT THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO OTHER -- YOU COLLEAGUES AND AND ASSEMBLY ON THAT THE DESIRE AGAIN IS TO KEEP KIDS SAFE NOT TO CHASE DOWN EVERY PERSON AND TRADED AT A DINNER MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- THAT'S SO I WOULD TAKE IT TARGETED APPROACH AND CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION I THINK THAT WE WERE HAVING THOSE SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF US. RIGHT BEFORE THIS HEARING SO WE AND I THINK WE CAME TO I I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TIME TO SORT OF FORMULATE WHAT THAT WOULD BE AN AGREEMENT -- PRIOR IF WE WERE DECIDED TO YOU DISNEY AMEND THE BILL BUT I'M CERTAINLY VERY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THEN. IT IN SOME AYE AYE SUPPORT THIS TODAY THANK YOU I AM. I WOULD EVER I HAVE LITTLE KIDS IN SCHOOL AND SO THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING KIDS SAFE. AND AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST MY WHEN I TOOK MY KIDS TO GET THEIR THEIR VACCINES IN THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES LOOKED AT ME LIKE. DADDY YOU'RE LETTING THIS PERSON STAB ME FOR THIS VACCINE -- BUT I REALIZED THE GREATER GOOD AND THE OVERALL. TO TALLY I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS IS ONE OF THAT -- MARCH ADVANCES IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND AND THIS IS A SOUND PUBLIC POLICY BUILT ON SITE SO I'M I'M IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW THEY JUST SAY I'M I'M THE ONE WHO'S TAKING ALL MY CHILDREN FOR THEIR VACCINES AND I WAS THE ONE WITH THEM MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MY FOR I HAVE JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO. AND I'M NOT SURE WHO TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF BECAUSE IT WAS A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SO WE CAN. WHOEVER KNOWS BEST [inaudible] SO. ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRES THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO ESTABLISH PROCESS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE APPEALS PROCESS. WHICH THE BILL ITSELF DOESN'T SAY REALLYMUCH ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND IT EXEMPTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND AGED JUST FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE BILL. SO MIKE MY QUESTION BASICALLY IS. THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE. THE PUBLIC WITH A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADOPTION OF STATE REGULATIONS AND TO ENSURE THE REGULATIONS A CLEAR. NECESSARY AND LEGALLY VALID. BY BY PASSING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT THE BILL WOULD DENY PARENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY. TO WEIGH IN ON IMPLEMENTATION OF A LAW. THE COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY. WAS DPH AND AGES S. EXEMPTED WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THAT OF THE PURPOSE OF THAT. FIVE TO LEAVE THAT UP. TO NOW THANK THANK YOU I BELIEVE THAT -- WAS PART OF DISCUSSION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OF THIS -- PARTICULAR BILL AND SO THAT'S THAT THIS IS BY WAY THAT THIS IS NOT UNIQUE -- I'VE SAYS CHAIR OF BOTH THIS HEALTH COMMITTEE PREVIOUSLY AND NOW IN THE SENATE AT THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN -- WE HAVE -- ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH MORE RAPIDLY -- THE THIS IS FREQUENTLY A PROVISION THAT IS IN -- THOSE BILLS TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO ACT MORE QUICKLY. CORRECT SO IF THEY COME OUT WITH THE GUIDELINES THAN ME OR THEIR PROCESS. IF THEY COME OUT WITH IT AND THEN THAT'S IT THERE'S NO. COMMENTS ON THAT THERE'S NO. WE WILL CERTAINLY PEOPLE. DID YOU WANT ME. TO YOU KNOW I I THINK DOCTOR PAN WAS CORRECT I MEAN THERE I BELIEVE THERE IS AN URGENCY TO THIS AND I THINK THAT'S THAT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT IT'S DRAFTED THIS WAY. BUT IT BUT IF THERE IS A CHALLENGE THESE ARE NOT THESE ARE REGULATIONS ARE CAN BE DEVELOPED BY THE AGENCY OF SOMETHING VOWED COMES FORWARD THERE'S NOTHING TO PRECLUDE SEE AGENCY FOR MAKING CHANGES TO THE GUIDELINES. FOR OR THE OR THE OR THE APPEAL PROCESS SO SO IT IS NOT IT IS NOT RESTRICTED THIS AT THE RIVER THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS IN THIS WAY IS TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. AND FOR THE PROTECT CHILDREN THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE WHEN YOU SAY MINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATION IS YEAH EXTENSION OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CORRECT. OKAY. SO THEN THE OTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING APPEALS. AND IT JUST KIND OF BROUGHT BECAUSE OF PERSONAL THING THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW TO MIND THAT. IT'S KIND IT'S BEEN STATED THAT THERE'S POTENTIALLY DOCTORS WHO ARE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING PATIENTS AND PER. PERSON BUT ARE WRITING EXEMPTION -- SO THIS PANEL OF THE THREE DOCTOR PANEL. AND IN MY OPINION THEN SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO MEET WITH THE DOCTOR. WHO'S WRITING THE EXEMPTION. THE PATIENT OR THEIR FAMILY PRIOR TO DENYING THE EXEMPTION ALSO SO IT KIND OF GOES BOTH WAYS -- DAYS. I'M THINKING YOU KNOW IF WE'RE REQUIRING THAT THE DOCTOR WHO WRITES EXEMPTION SEES THE PATIENT WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY A GOOD. STANDARD OF CARE ANYWAY. BUT THE PANEL WHO COULD BE REMOTE AND NOT KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PATIENT AND WHY THAT CAME TO MIND IS BECAUSE I HAD TO BRING MY SON TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. LAST YEAR RIGHT AFTER SESSION AND HE WAS PRESENTING WITH STIFF NECK PAIN HEADACHE AND A FEVER SO THE FIRST THING WE THOUGHT OF BECAUSE IT WAS A MENINGITIS OUTBREAK GOING ON AT THIS YEAR'S DO. THAT THIS COULD BE A CONCERN AND HIS COUSIN GOES THERE AND HE WAS JUST WITH HIM. SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID TO GO. AND IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS SLOT MASK ONE EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME I THINK IN A MASS BUT I WAS ALREADY EXPOSED SO -- SO IT WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY HE IMMEDIATELY WENT AND WITHIN MINUTES THEY DID ALL KINDS OF BLOOD WORK SWAP THIS ROAD AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT CAME IT WAS INCONCLUSIVE. BUDGET JUST TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT. HE DIDN'T HAVE MENINGITIS THE COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THEY DETERMINE A STRIP OF WAS WEIRD TYPE A STRAP NOT THE NORMAL SO ANYWAY. BUT IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE WRITTEN. THE NOTES COMING OUT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT SAYS -- SOMETHING VERY VAGUE LIKE FEVER SORE THROAT OR SOMETHING. SO TO ME. IF IF THERE IS A SOMETHING WRITTEN AND IT JUST KIND OF SKIMS OVER THE ISSUE DOESN'T SAY WHY I BROUGHT HIM IN THERE WHY EVERYONE TOOK IT SO SERIOUSLY OF FIRST. WE COULD EASILY BE SWAYED HAVING NOT MET WITH THE PARENTS ARE NOT MET WITH THE DOCTOR IN ATTENDANCE IN KNOW. ABOUT THAT ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT THAT TO MY WHAT WAS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT -- WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY POSITIONS TO DOCUMENT ADEQUATELY -- RIGHT YOU HAVE A REASON TO DOCUMENT ADEQUATELY YES -- AND THE AND ALSO BY THE WAY THE EVEN IN THE C. P. H. REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE CLINICIANS. APART THE REASON WE WANT THAT THE ALLOW THE RECORD RELEASE -- FROM THE FROM THE PARENT IS IS THAT THAT ALLOWS THE PHYSICIAN TO THEN SHARE INFORMATION ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH MAY SEEK SO WE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE THE KNIGHTS OF THE BECAUSE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION. SO WE WANT TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT TO ALLOW THE PHYSICIAN WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE PATIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS BOTH NOT JUST AT THE PEEL PROCESS BUT EVEN AT THE C. PH LEVEL -- SO SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE NORMAL PEER REVIEW PROCESS SO FOR EXAMPLE I SERVED ON THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE WAS AT UC DAVIS. AND YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT WACO CRITICAL INCIDENTS THINGS WHEN THINGS DIDN'T GO RIGHT. WE DIDN'T PULL AND ALL THE FAMILIES AND EVERYTHING WHAT HAPPENS IS WE WOULD GO LOOK AT THE RECORD SOMETIMES WE THEN SEND INCREASED TO INVOLVE TO THE INVOLVE PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE THERE AND SAY. SO BASED ON THE RECORD WE STILL HAVE THESE QUESTIONS WHAT HAPPENED CAN YOU TELL US AND SO FORTH. AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE IN THIS BILL THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED THE THE PIECE WHERE IT SAYS WELL WE WANT THE PARENTS TO GIVE INFORMATION FOR BOTH THE PART THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT ALSO THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THAT'S REALLY TO BE SURE THAT BECAUSE I AS A PHYSICIAN HAS A WELFARE DIDN'T GIVE YOU. TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU THAT THAT NOW THAT TAKING CARE OF SO NOW THE PHYSICIAN CAN SAY OKAY WE DON'T NEEDTO DELAY I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE THE THE THE THE CLINICIAN MAY SAY. WELL -- YOU COULDN'T YOU GAVE ME THIS THING BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT ICE THIS IS STILL A FACTOR WHICH WOULD HELP ME MAKE A DECISION. AND SO DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ABOUT THE PATIENT AND THE PHYSICIAN WOULD SAY. WELL ES I DO ARE MAYBE I DON'T YET MAYBE I'LL GO AND THEY'LL TALK TO THE PATIENT AND GET THAT FROM THEM SO SO THAT SO THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS NOT AND NOW OF COURSE ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO REVIEW PROCESS WHEN THE POSITIONS LOOK AT THAT. AND THEY SAY THERE'S A MISSING INFORMATION BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION I WANT TO BE SURE EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION GETS. ONE THAT IS THE PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL BE SURE EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION WILL GET. ONE AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. NO JUST BECAUSE WE JUST AB FOR CLARIFICATION MISS WALDRON THERE IS A SECTION. IN SECTION FOR THE BILL WHICH SAYS THAT PARENTS OR GUARDIANS MAY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES OF THE APPEAL SO IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE DOCTOR GAVE THE ENTIRE HISTORY AND YOU AS IN THE CASE OF YOUR SON. YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT AS AS PART OF THE APPEAL AND AND BE A PARTICIPANT IN THE APPEAL PROCESS [inaudible] OKAY. SO JUST REALLY QUICK ONE LAST QUESTION SO. AND I HEARD. IT I GUESS I HAVE TO DRESS THE TO THE OPPOSITION OR THE TWEEN OR PEOPLE -- MISS SCOTT I THINK WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAID IT SO WITH THE FIVE EXEMPTION RULE. AT UNITS TOUCHED ON THAT A COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT YOUR ABILITY TO GET A VALID MEDICAL EXEMPTION HOW? DO YOU SEE THAT. THIS BEING THE CASE [inaudible] I WILL. OKAY I'M SORRY. I IS SO BEING IMMUNE COMPROMISED AND CHILDREN THAT HAVE HAD VACCINE EXAM X.. VACCINE THEY HAD BACK SEEN EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE OF OUR VACCINE REACTIONS BOTH AND MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN. IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION WHERE WE ACTUALLY FOR A PORTION OF OUR EXEMPTION WE ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR TWO OF THEM VACCINES UNDER THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS THE OTHER VACCINES WE DO NOT QUALIFY THOSE WOULD. I MOVE INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE VACCINE REACTIONS TO THOSE SPECIFIC VACCINES. AND SO WITH. WITH THAT FALLING WITHOUT AN OUTSIDE OF THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS. MY CONCERN IS WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE SEEN BY AN IMMUNOLOGIST I HAVE AN IMMUNOLOGIST BECAUSE OF MY PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. WE WOULD BE SEEN BY THEM OR A A PEDIATRICIAN AT A LARGE HOSPITAL THAT SPECIALIZES IN IMMUNOLOGY. AND IT GETS VERY CONFUSING. AS I'M SURE I'M PROBABLY CONFUSED YOU GUYS WITH THIS -- IT GETS VERY CONFUSING WHEN A VACCINE EXEMPTION OF THAT TYPE IS GIVEN AND SO WE ARE NOT SORRY -- SO WE DON'T FALL WITHIN THAT AND SO WE WOULD FALL OUTSIDE AND I THE BEST. THE BEST JUDGMENT OF THE DOCTOR AT THAT POINT TO GIVE US THAT VACCINE EXEMPTION MY FEAR WITH THOSE WITHOUT FIVE EXEMPTION ROLE IS MY IMMUNOLOGIST IS WRITING AND VACCINE EXEMPTIONS EVERY DAY FOR PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCIES THAT FALLS WITHIN THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE AUTOMATICALLY FLAG. AT THAT POINT. AND SO IF ALL OF THEIR VACCINE EXEMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED. THAN MINE BEING OUTSIDE OF THAT SCOPE OF THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS IS GOING TO BE SCRUTINIZED AND SO IN THAT CASE. WHEN MINE IS BEING LOOKED UP SO CLOSELY AND WE HAVE SUCH A? COMPLEX MEDICAL ISSUE AND AND HISTORY IN OUR FAMILY MY CONCERN IS THAT A PANEL OF THREE DOCTORS THAT ARE GENERAL PRACTITIONERS. FOR PEDIATRICIANS AREN'T GOING TO UNDERSTAND OUR COMPLEX IMMUNOLOGY ISSUE AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU WERE ASKING THE PEER TO PEER COMMENT IS WHEN A INSURANCE COMPANY DID DIDN'T DENY IS A PEER TO PEER REVIEW. THEY ACTUALLY GET ON THE PHONE AND HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE DOCTOR THAT WROTE THAT IN SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR THAT PEER TO PEER REVIEW TO BE. REAL TIME LIVE WITH THAT DOCTOR SO THAT THE WHOLE COMPLEX SITUATION LIKE OURS IS UNDERSTOOD. A I AND AND THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN AND LIKE I SAID I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IF AMENDED PROPERLY TO INCLUDE ITEMS LIKE THAT WHERE IS THAT DOCTOR AND NOT THREE DOCTOR PANEL. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE NOT JUST BY PEOPLE WORK PASSED BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE A COMPLEX SITUATION LIKE OURS IT'S NOT GOING TO FULLY BE ABLE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND AND I'M. GUESSING THAT WE WILL END UP THE TOP THIRD LEVEL AND BE IN FRONT OF THOSE THOUGHT THREE PANEL AND I PERSONALLY BECAUSE DOCTOR PAN HAS MENTIONED THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF THESE DOCTORS THAT ARE GETTING THAT DON'T HAVE THIS FACE TO FACE CONTACT THAT ARE WRITING THESE EXEMPTIONS WE SHOULD ALSO. GIVE PATIENTS LIKE MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN THAT BENEFIT TO OF BEING IN FRONT OF THAT PANEL OR ON A CONFERENCE CALL SO WE CAN EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION AS WELL BECAUSE IT IS SO COMPLEX. AND I'VE HAD IT IS THE SAME THING THAT YOU'VE HAPPEN IT HAD HAD HAPPENED WHERE MY CHILDREN'S RECORDS HAVE BEEN KEPT IN CORRECTLY OR MY RECORDS HAVE BEEN KEPT IN CORRECTLY AND I AM CONSTANTLY FILING HIT BY -- VIOLATIONS AND REQUESTING FOR MY RECORDS TO BE UPDATED AFTER EVERY SINGLE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT OR PROCEDURE THAT I HAVE I HAVE TO REVIEW THE CHART. AND THEN FIX IT BECAUSE IT HAPPENS. ALMOST EVERY TIME I HAVE A PROCEDURE WHICH IS VERY VERY OFTEN WITH PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. SUPER COMPLEX AND SO. AGAIN THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS THAT THIS IS AMENDED WHERE WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THIS PANEL WHEN WE GET IN FRONT OF THEM THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] YOU. DOCTOR YOU'REA RAMP INTO TERMS FOR YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS. OKAY DOCTOR REGULAR. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL ONE APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR. IT'S ALWAYS APPROPRIATE WHEN THERE'S A QUORUM. SECOND WE HAVE A SECOND BY MISTER BONTA OR SOMEBODY ELSE I DIDN'T HEAR THAT. SOMEBODY -- MISS BURKE OKAY -- SO I I TO AS SOMEBODY WHO IS WAS NOT A SUPPORTER OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN I WANT TO SAY THAT -- IT IS THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL TOPIC AND SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE AROUND US HAVE BEEN A MOTIONAL HOWEVER TO REITERATE. THE FACT THAT THAT THE NEGATIVE PERSONAL DIRECTS ARE INAPPROPRIATE NINE I DO KNOW YOU TO BE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALTHOUGH WE DIFFERENTIATE ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE -- FOR AND I'M HOPING THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION WERE ABLE TO EXPRESS OF DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES THAT WILL GET YOU TO A PLACE WHERE. WHERE ARE YOU WILL HAVE A BILL THAT THAT REALLY REPRESENTS ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M I AM HOPEFUL? WITH THAT I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE HONESTLY JUST THEIR THEIR EDUCATION QUESTIONS FOR MYSELF -- SO IN THIS SITUATION I THINK THIS WOMAN HAD OF A VERY GOOD POINT WHERE WHERE SOME THINGS ARE JUST MORE COMPLICATED THAN OTHERS -- AND I AM CURIOUS -- AND THE CONCERT MY ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THIS KIND AND NEEDS MEDICAL EXCEPTION RIGHT. AS IN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE YOU SAID FOR EXAMPLE A PRO LONG SEIZURES WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF ADMINISTRATION OF A VACCINE RIGHT SO LET'S SAY MY DAUGHTER HAS. WHICH I'VE SEEN IN PAPERS WHERE THEY SAY MY DAUGHTER HAD A SEIZURE MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T HAVE A SEIZURE OF MY DAUGHTER HAD TO ME WHAT I FELT WAS A STRONG REACTION. TO A VACCINE AND THEN I OPTED FOR A PRO LONG SCHEDULE MY DAUGHTER HAD HER BACKSEAT HAS HAD HER VACCINATIONS BUT OVER A SCHEDULE THAT I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH IT BECAUSE I WANTED HER TO BE SAFE AND I WANT TO COMMUNITIES. SO BUT LET'S SEE ONE DOES ONE CHILD DOES HAVE A SEIZURE AND BE CLEAR AS A MOTHER MY DAUGHTER HAS ONE SEIZURE THERE'S NOTHING YOU'RE SAYING TO ME. YOU PUT ME IN JAIL. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME THAT IS NOT GOING TO TRY TO LOOK VERY VERY CAREFULLY AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITHIN THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT CHANGED. RIGHT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND. HOWEVER MY CONCERN LIKE A GET WITH NEEDS MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND MY QUESTION IS. IS IT SAYS PROLONGS FEATURES. THIS IS MY DAUGHTER HAS ONE SEIZURE FROM A VACCINE. WHY DOES NOT NOT QUALIFY AS A REASON FOR ME NOW TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS? IS THAT INVESTIGATION ONLY ON THAT. ONE VACCINE OR IS IT ON THE WHOLE COURSE IS IT. ON THE WHOLE COURSE OF AXE SCENES. OKAY IT'S A YES YES SO SO FIRST OF ALL -- IN REGARDS -- TO THE SEIZURES I I WOULD SAY IS THAT WHAT WE WANTED TO IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE BASE OUR MEDICAL DECISIONS AGAIN ON SCIENCE AND THE EVIDENCE -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT THERE ARE THINGS WE KNOW AND THEN THERE'S THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ALL RIGHT SO WE KNOW THAT BACK OUT YEAH OF AXES ON CAUSE AUTISM. THAT'S SETTLED YEAH THAT'S BEEN STUDIED -- OVER AND OVER AGAIN RIGHT -- LET ME SHOULD I SHARE WITH YOU. PERHAPS THERE'S ACTUALLY A STORY DOES A STORY WRITTEN IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND I SHOULD GET THAT TO YOU -- SO WHAT HAPPENED IS IS THAT -- WHEN THEY CAME FIRST CAME OUT WITH THAT THAT FEAR TETANUS FOR TOSSES VACCINE OKAY? THERE'S CAME OUT THEY DID NOTE THAT THERE IS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE OF SEIZURES AND A FEVER AND SEIZURES ASSOCIATED WITH. OUR CHILDREN WHO GOT THAT VACCINE RIGHT AND SO IN FACT IT WAS. IN THE CONSERVATION PRECAUTIONS IT SAYS WELL IF YOU HAVE A SEIZURE -- WE DON'T GIVE ANYMORE AND I REMEMBER AS A TRAINING DEATHS -- WE SAID LIKE OKAY WELL THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF SEIZURES DON'T GIVE THAT THE TAP BACKS AT THE EDGE OF DENNIS D. T. P. IS BEFORE THE FIRE WITH YOURSELF. AND FOR THE PEOPLE ALSO WANT INVESTIGATED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T KNOW THEY COULD THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY SAID WELL THIS IS IT THIS VACCINE OURS ARE NOT. AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY DID STUDIES AND ACTUALLY WHAT THEY FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY DUE TO A GENETIC CONDITION. CALLED SURVEYS SYNDROME. SURVEYS SYNDROME IS A GENETIC CONDITION WHERE CHILD WILL DEVELOP SEIZURES AND SOME DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY -- AND AND THEN IN A FAT AND OF COURSE IT AND IT'S TRIGGERED THE FIRST SYMPTOMS ARE TRIGGERED YOU BUY SOME INFLAMMATORY EVENTS SO COULD BE GETTING A VACCINE IT COULD BE. A COLD BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE BY SO IN FACT THE THEY INVESTIGATE AND THEY FOUND THAT. CHILDREN WHO -- WHETHER THEY'RE VACCINE OR NOT HAD THE SAME RATE OF SEIZURES AND OTHER SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THIS AND OKAY I THINK BUT LET'S GO BROADER THAN THAT OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE BUT LET'S SEE THERE IS IT LET'S SEE. MY TARGETS A HUNDRED AND FOUR FEVER OKAY AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT PROLONG BUT IT'S DANGEROUS ARE IS THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT A DOCTOR SO AND A HUNDRED FOR FEVERS QUALIFIES TO ME IS DANGEROUS EMERGENCY ROOM TIME RIGHT -- NO NOT NECESSARILY BUT LET ME JUST GET SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS THAT WE'LL SEE TO ME I FELT LIKE A FEVER WAS AND FOR ME TO RECONSIDER TO CONSIDER HOW TO DEAL WITH MY BUT MY QUESTION IS IS SOMETHING A SITUATION HAPPENS THAT IS DIRE ENOUGH THAT. MY DAUGHTER NEEDS TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY TEMPERS UP SEVEN DAYS WHATEVER THAT SITUATION IN. WHAT WE IT WHY DOESN'T THAT QUALIFY FOR SOME A REASON FOR ME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO REVIEW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN WHY DO I NEED TO BE CONCERNED THAT AS IT GOES THROUGH THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT DECIDE? THAT THEN MY DAUGHTER STILL NEEDS TO HAVE THE BACKSEAT VACCINATIONS SHE COULD I ORDER TO RED WINE I HAVE A GLASS OF RED WINE I DIDN'T KNOW IT. I KNOW IT'S A TOTAL BUMMER -- A SINGLE MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD HE BEING ALLERGIC TO READ ONE SUCKS -- BUT JUST DOESN'T CUT IT RIGHT YEAH -- BUT I DRINK WAY RUN FOREVER I WAS ALLERGIC TO IT ONE DAY HAD A GLASS OF RED WINE MY THROAT CLOSE AND I WAS IN AN AMBULANCE. I WAS SCARED. WHAT IS THIS THING I MEAN IF SITUATIONS LIKE THAT OCCUR I'M NOT SURE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT DOESN'T QUALIFY I DON'T WANT TO JUST TO QUALIFY FOR THAT? ONE VACCINE I THEN SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THEM ALL OKAY SO SO I WOULD SAY IS FIRST OF ALL AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT. YEAH IS IT. IS IT EVEN IS IT LIEU POSSIBLE THAT'S CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RIGHT AND IS IT JUST THINGS WE KNOW THERE'S THINGS WE DON'T KNOW SO ACTUALLY IF I CAN JUST REFER YOU SAID IGH FEVER WE THERE'S A CONDITION WE KNOW THAT. CHILDREN CAN DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED FEBRILE SEIZURES RIGHT -- AND THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY CAUSED BY RAPID RISE IN YOUR TEMPERATURE RIGHT AND THEY CAN HAVE A SEIZURE WE ALSO KNOW BY THE WAY THAT CHILDREN HAVE FEBRILE SEIZURES. ACTUALLY GROW OUT OF THEM AND THERE'S NO LONG TERM NEUROLOGICAL SEQUELAE ALRIGHT AND IT'S NOT DIRECTLY SO TO A VACCINES ALTHOUGH SOME VACCINES CAN CAUSE FEVER AND THEIR FIRST CAN. THAT THIS CAN HAVE TRACKED TRIGGER RIGHT ACTION BUT THAT WOULD NOT. THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS CONDITION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THIS CONDITION YOU KNOW THIS CONDITION IS NOT A CAUSED BY THE VACCINE INTO IS NOT. DOES NOT LEAD -- TO LONG TERM HARM -- THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE A PERMANENT CONTRA ELLA A PERMIT REASON NOT TO GET YOUR CHILD VACCINATED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOW IF YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE SO. IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE RIGHT I MEAN. RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT. HOUSING AND IF YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION RIGHT WELL AT THE END NOT THE RULE AND WHICH IS WHAT THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS ABOUT RIGHT. IT'S NOT FOR THE PLETHORA PEOPLE WHO CAN GET A VACCINE WHO GET THEM EVERY DAY WHO ARE FINE AND THERE'S NOT AN ISSUE IT'S ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO MAYBE HAVE. THAT FALL INTO THE CRACKS AND THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT A BILL THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THOSE EXCEPTIONS. THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE MY CONCERN IS SO I I I LET YOU FINISH AND THEN ON THE OPPOSITION FINISH HOWEVER I'M GOING TO SEE A DOCTOR I WOULD PREFER SOMEONE ELSE ANSWER THIS QUESTION OKAY SO LET ME JUST FINISH INTO YOUR QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO WHAT. WE WANNA DO IS BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE EVERY MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- OF COURSE WEAKENS THE COMMUNITY OF THE SCHOOL RIGHT BUT WE WON'T BE SURE EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS MEDICAL THAT SHE GETS. ONE AND IN FACT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- WE WANT TO ACTUALLY LEAN IN FAVOR OF WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT IS IT'S IN THE SPACE OF WE DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT BE THE VACCINE THAT MIGHT NOT. THEN WILL WE WANNA LEAN IN FAVOR OF THE CHILD NOT AS SAYING THAT WELLOKAY WE'LL GIVE YOU THE EXEMPTION BILLS WE KNOW FOR IF IF WE LIKE NOW WE RECOGNIZE THIS CONDITION IT'S NOT SO TO THE VACCINE. THEN I'D I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE US THE REST OF THE CHILDREN INCLUDING THE ONES WHO REALLY NEED THE EXEMPTION. THAT WE'RE NOT GRANTING EXEMPTION FOR THOSE CONDITIONS AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHERE THE MEDICAL THAT'S WHERE THE WE LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AND THAT'S THE THE JUDGMENT SO WE DON'T KNOW. WE WANT TO GIVE THE LATITUDE THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE WITH APPEAL PANEL SO FORTH -- WE DON'T CREATE A LOOPHOLE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THERE ARE. THAT HIS GROUP A HANDFUL IT'S GOOD POSITIONS WILL TAKE A LITTLE LOOPHOLE AND TURN IT INTO A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY UNFORTUNATELY AND ENDANGER CHILDREN THE PROCESS AND THAT WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING. YOU KNOW AND I ACTUALLY DON'T EITHER. AS I JUST HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS -- I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION IS IS WE HAVE ONE DOCTOR WHO'S BEEN SUSPENDED IS THAT CORRECT AS A RESULT OF BETTER EXTENDING. OKAY WHICH IS A WHAT IS A CALL. PROBATION IS ON PROBATION. A DIFFERENT STAGES OF PROBATION OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM -- OF ANY SYSTEM [inaudible] REALITY -- AND YOU SAID YOU HAD TWO HUNDRED IS IT TWO HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ARE CASES OF OTHERS IN. IN PROCESS OF BEING AND PROBATION HOW MANY DOCTORS BESIDES THE ONE ANOTHER THING IS THE MEDICAL BOARD PERSON YOU KNOW ANSWER THE QUESTION. MEDICAL ONE SHE LIKE SHE ALL RIGHT SO OF YOUR CLOSE IT'S A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED. AND THEN ANOTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT DOCTORS WHO ARE JUST OVER MEDICAL ATTENTION OKAY RELATED TO MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND THEN -- WE'VE HAD LIKE YOU SAID ONE ACTION TAKEN RESULT IN A PROBATION WE HAVE. HE SAID OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD SORRY -- OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD SINCE -- SB TWO SEVENTY SET WILL SINCE THE LAST FEW YEARS. YEAH. THREE YEARS THREE OVER THREE YEARS. SINCE THAT BILL HAD OKAY CAM INTO LAW AND THEN -- WE HAVE CURRENTLY HUNDRED THREE INVESTIGATIONS PENDING SO THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE'VE HAD TO COME TO CLOSE FORTY NINE COMPLAINTS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS ONE HAS BEEN IN THREE OF A ONE IN THREE YEARS HAS BEEN FOUND -- IS IN PROBATION AND DO YOU HAVE ABOUT SOMEWHERE IN TWO HUNDRED AND INVESTIGATION I JUST. PART OF ME WONDER IF MAYBE THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE HEAVY HANDED A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S A QUESTION PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER LEADER CONVERSATION I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING ALL AGREE ON THAT. I ONLY HAVE I HAVE. TO HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I THINK I'M GOOD I THINK I'M NOT GOOD -- LET ME BACK THAT A YOU KNOW IT'S JUST FOR ME LIKE I SAID THIS IS KIND OF ONE OF THOSE SUPER A MOTIONAL. CONVERSATIONS AND WELL ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION ONE IF SOMEONE HAS A FAMILY IF THE FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION. WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A TIME? WHEN? FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY WOULD ALLOW ME A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE MY CHILD TO GET A VACCINATION ON AT THE ON SET. SO FOR EXAMPLE AT AT ACTUALLY IN THE CDC GUIDELINES THEMSELVES IF YOUR CHILD HAS A FIRST DEGREE RELATIVE WHO HAS A CONGENITAL HEREDITARY IMMUNO DEFICIENCY -- YOU AUTOMATICALLY YOU GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR THE MMR AND VARICELLA SO BASICALLY JUST TO WELL THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE THERE'S A RISK BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVE VIRUS VACCINES I ALSO IF I NEED TO SAY IS IS THAT -- AND BLANK. RIGHT THINKING YOUR NAME AGAIN. EIGHTY LAZY SCOTT YEAH I THINK IF YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED BY AN IMMUNOLOGIST YOU'LL BE FOLLOWED BY IN YOUR LAWS SEE OF A COMPLEX. SITUATION -- THAT AGAIN. YEAH I CAN'T PREDICT INTO THE FUTURE BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF SITUATION I WOULD. THINK THAT KNOWING MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE THAT IF I WAS ON A PEER REVIEW PANEL IT'S A WORLD THIS THIS SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THIS LOOKS REAL RIGHT THIS THERE FOLLOWED BY IMMUNOLOGIST. THAT PERSON IS SOMEONE WHO'S YEAH AND AND AND I MEAN IT'S CLEARLY IMMUNE SUPPRESSION -- THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS INVOLVED. THAT'S THE SPACE WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WE'RE NOT SAYING IT'S STRICTLY CZ BY THE WAY THIS THESE GUYS DO GIVE. YOU KNOW SAYING IF YOU'RE IN SUPPRESSED AND SO FORTH THEY DO ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU TO GET EXEMPTIONS FOR THOSE REASONS. SO I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT MAYBE WE DON'T QUITE FIT IN THE BOX YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT DO YOU FIT IN THE BOX BUT THAT'S WHY WE ALSO PUT IN THE PROCESS BY THE WAY WE ALSO SEE THE C. P. H. CLINICIANS. CAN DO STANDARD OF CARE TO SO THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY TIED THE THINK THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE YOU GO YOU KNOW WHAT -- THERE FOLLOWED BY A SPECIALIST THEY CLEARLY HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT PERSON IS GOING TO IS LIKE OKAY LET'S GIVE THAT PERSON THAT EXEMPTION THE PERSON SAYS WELL I YEAH I I YEAH I HAD SOME SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY UNCLE AND I WANT TO MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR MY KID. AND SOMEONE'S WRITING A LOT OF YOU KNOW SAYING THAT -- THERE'S A FAMILY HISTORY OF IMMUNE DEFICIENCY BUT THE CHILD AND THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION WITH AN EFFICIENCY IS A DISTANT RELATIVE. THAT GETS A LOOK I THINK THAT REQUIRES MORE INVESTIGATION AN INQUIRY INTO THAT WE CAN'T PROVE IT THEN THAT WOULD -- THAT'S FINE MORE OF AN EXCUSE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. SO IS ACTUALLY UNDER CARE BY A SPECIALIST IN IMMUNOLOGY -- FRY WOULD GET GET QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO THAT SPECIALIST HOWEVER LACY IS STILL CONCERNED SO CAN I JUST HEAR FROM YOU APOLOGIZE. AND MAYBE THIS COULD CLEAR IT UP IF I EXPLAINED REALLY QUICK WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR SCENARIO AND THEN YOU CAN EVEN ANSWER HOW YOU WOULD SUGGEST IT WOULD BE TREATED SO -- BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS IMMUNO COMPROMISED I WAS RECEIVING VACCINES AND I RECEIVED A T. DOT. D. TAP VACCINE AND HAD A VERY SEVERE SEVERE REACTION -- THAT INCLUDED VERTIGO FOR TWO AND A HALF WEEKS I COULDN'T GET OUT OF THAT. I HAD A HORRIBLE JOINT AND JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING WHERE THEY HAD TO CUT OFFERINGS. I HAD FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS -- HORRIBLE STOMACH ACHES -- I HAD VISION DISRUPTIONS WHERE I WAS SEEING FLOATERS BESIDES THE VERTIGO. AND I LOST PARTIAL HEARING IN MY RIGHT EAR FOR UP TO TWO MONTHS IT LIKELY CAME BACK SO I CAN HEAR AGAIN. BUT THIS WAS A VERY EXTREME REACTION AND WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY DOCTOR I I ACTUALLY CALLED BECAUSE I COULDN'T GO BACK RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED. THEY TOLD ME THAT I MUST A CAUGHT A VIRUS. WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS IMMUNE COMPROMISED AT THE TIME -- I STARTED VACCINATING MY CHILDREN THEY ENDED UP HAVING -- THEIR FIRST DE TAP AND DID NOT A HAVE A VACCINE REACTION IT WASN'T UNTIL THEIR SECOND DO YOU TAP THAT THEY HAD THE SAME EXACT VACCINE REACTION THAT I DID. I CALLED THEIR PEDIATRICIAN AND THEY TOLD ME THEY MUST OF CAUGHT A VIRUS. AND SO IT MADE ME AS A MOTHER REALIZE I NEED TO LOOK DEEPER INTO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH OUR IMMUNOLOGY AND I I HAD ALREADY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER SO I KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF WITH MY BODY. SO THAT'S WHEN I FINALLY WAS REFERRED TO YOU SEE US OFF AND THEY DID THE MILLION DOLLAR WORK UP BECAUSE CV IDEAS AND DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS. ONLY ABOUT ONE IN SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE WHAT I HAVE SO IT'S RARE. ETAN'S. LUCKILY WE DIDN'T IN THE MEANTIME VACCINATE THEM AGAIN WE HAD HELD OFF SO LIKE YOU SAID YOU YOU START LOOKING AT THIS AND AND WAITING AND HOLDING OFFICE OF PARENT. AND BUT WE WOULDN'T UNDER THIS LAW I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE TIME TO DO THAT THIS. OKAY SO THIS TOOK ME. OVER A YEAR AND A HALF TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH US SO THIS WAS THIS WAS A LONG SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE THIRTY DAYS WHAT OF APPLY TO ME AND I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BUT OKAY. WE CAN OKAY SO. IT SAYS SO THAT HAPPENED IN THE MEANTIME I WAS ALSO VACCINATED AGAIN AND HAD ANOTHER FAX THE REACTION YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH C. B. ID BY KEVIN A VACCINE. AT PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE IN YOU HAVE YOUR TIGHTER COUNT TAKEN BEFORE. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TITERS FOR PNEUMONIA IS WHAT THAT VACCINE IS FOR THEN YOU WERE GIVEN THE VACCINE THE PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. AND THEN THEY TAKE THE TIGHTER COUNT AGAIN AFTER AND THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN BECAUSE I DIDN'T RESPOND AT ALL I HAD NO TIGHTER COUNTS SHOW UP. THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN TWO MONTHS AFTER STILL NO TIGHTER COUNT. AND SO AT THAT POINT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CV ID. AND WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS A VACCINE REACTION THAT MY CHILDREN HAD. AS WELL AS MYSELF. AT THAT POINT THEN. I HAD TO GO GET A VACCINE EXEMPTION WHICH YES IT WAS VERY EASY AT THAT POINT BUT I'M CONCERNED WITH THIS FIVE EXEMPTION RULE. IS WELL DOCTORS STICK THEIR NECK OUT ON THE LINE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME THEY DON'T FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY SPECIFICALLY. YES. AND SENATOR PAN IT SAID WERE EXEMPT COMPLETELY FOR MM ARE AND FOR SALAS BEING. ODD BEING A MOVIE I'M YOU KNOW COMPROMISED THAT'S NO QUESTION BUT THE DETAIL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FALL WITHIN THOSE GUIDELINES AND MY PEDIATRICIAN DIDN'T EVEN DOCUMENT THEIR CHART BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A NORMAL VIRUS IS WHAT SHE HAD SAID. IT WORRIES ME BECAUSE OUR DOCUMENTATION. YOU KNOW I HAD TO ADD IT AFTERWARDS WHICH WHAT A SECOND LOOK MAKE ME LOOK LIKE ADDING TO MY CHILDREN'S CHART. AND THEN ALSO -- WHEN WHEN I COMPLAINED ABOUT MY VACCINE WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS A VACCINE REACTION TO MY DOCTOR AGAIN DIDN'T DIE YOU KNOW DIDN'T WRITE IT ON MY CHART IS A VACCINE EXAMPLE S. VACCINE REACTION AT THAT TIME EITHER? AND SO IT STARTS TO GET TURKEY AND THEN HEPATITIS B. SO WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED SERUM SICKNESS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE REACTING SO YOU YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SIR -- SICKNESS. AND SO SIR I'M SICK YES I KNOW THIS GETS VERY COMPLEX AND I KNOW YOU ALL ARE NOT DOCTORS BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. IS SIR -- SICKNESS THEY SAY THAT THE REASON WHY WE REACT THIS WAY IS BECAUSE IT'S A AND BOTH THE D. TAPI ON THE PNEUMOCOCCAL MADE ME REACT THIS WAY IS. MY ANTIBODIES GET TRAPPED INSIDE MY TISSUE JOINTS. IT COULD EVEN BE BRAIN AND MAKE YOUR BRAIN SWELL. AND SO MY ANTIBODIES WILL GET TRAPPED AND I FOR SOME REASON MY BODY DOESN'T GET RID OF THEM. AND THEY ARE GUESSING THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY CHILDREN TOO ALTHOUGH AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE FIX CV ID AND AT ANY TIME YOU CAN DEVELOP CB ID SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WAS BORN WITH. YOU DEVELOP IT OVER TIME AND SO RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE SEE THE ID AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY. THEIR BODIES ARE REACTING TO VACCINES LIKE MINE SO I AGAIN HAVE THIS KIND OF SWISS CHEESE OF MEDICAL RECORDS NOT EXPLAINING IT AND SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF SITUATIONS THAT WERE TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT AND JUST TO BE CLEAR WE ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE LIMIT OF FIVE IS THAT NO ONE LIKES TO BE CALLED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE RIGHT LIKE NO ONE WANTS TO BE NO ONE WANTS THEIR FIVE EXEMPTIONS AND THEN GET CALLED IN ALL OF THEIR STUFF IS REVIEWED AND THEN. ALL THE SUDDEN BY SUBJECTIVE WITH APPEAR OF THREE PEOPLE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE -- WHO MAYBE MORE HEAVY HANDED OR LESS HAVING ENDED THAT MAKING A CHOICE ON THIS DOCTORS RIGHT AND THAT REALLY NEEDED A SIGN OR TO ANALYZE AND THEN IF YOURS DOES NOT QUALIFY ON THE HIGHER END OF THOSE? TEN MAYBE I I'M YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MACHINE THIS IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND SHE HAS IT SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE EXPRESS AND I I THINK THIS IS WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO SAY. IS THAT THE CONCERN IS IS THAT ONCE THERE IS THAT THRESHOLD. YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU GET CALLED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. FIRST OF ALL DOES ANYONE EVER WANT TO GET CALLED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE NO NO AND THEN SECOND OF ALL ONCE THERE'S LET'S SAY TEN OF THOSE. IS THERE THE FEELING OR NEED BY THIS PEER REVIEWED DEPENDING ON THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT. WHICH IS OUT OF ALL OF OUR CONTROL THEN -- WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL QUALIFY ARE NOT BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE WHO DOES FALL DEAD IN LINE WITH THE CDC GOT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE YOU CAN ADD A LOT YOU KNOW. NO THAT'S OKAY AND I AND ONE OF MY CONCERNS TO IS WILL THAT PEER TO PEER REVIEW TRULY BE AS A QUESTION WAS ASKED EARLIER. A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY DO THAT FOR INSURANCE SO MY IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY GETS TONIGHT ALL THE TIME TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THAT MY INSURANCE COMPANY SO THEY TRY TO GET OUT OF THAT AND WHEN A TRUE PEER TO PEER REVIEW IS. IS DONE MY IMMUNOLOGIST GETS ON THE PHONE WITH MY INSURANCE DOCTOR AND THEY TALK BACK AND FORTH THEY HAVE MY RECORDS AND BUT THEY'VE DENIED MY CLAIM. AND SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THREE DOCTOR PANEL THEY'LL HAVE ME AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT PEER TO PEER TALKING WITH MY IMMUNOLOGIST REVIEW AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE. REALLY GREAT TEN CLUED IN THE SPELL AND AND AN INTELLIGENT ADD TO THIS BILL WOULD BE HAVING THAT PEER TO PEER REVIEW EITHER A CONFERENCE CALL OR IN PERSON AND ALLOW. I I MEAN I'M LIKELY VERY HEAVILY IT EDUCATED ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE OF WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH BUT ALLOW PARENTS LIKE MYSELF TO BE THERE AND EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION TO AND MAKE SURE IT'S NOT JUST SOME DOCTOR. MISSING SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO US OR MISS UNDERSTAND THAT JUST. BY LOOKING AT A PIECE OF PAPER THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THINKING. AYE AYE HOPEFUL LIKE I SAID I THINK IT. I MEAN. I DON'T GO UP ON THESE ARE EVER. I NEVER GO UP ON THEM BECAUSE THEY JUST I WANT THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THE CHOICES FOR MY FAMILY AND MY CHILD AND I AND I HAVE. AND I STRUGGLED WITH THAT WHEN I CAME HERE BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER WAS AN INFANT WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED AND I GOT ON AIRPLANES. pMY DAUGHTER BACK AND FORTH. AND I AND AFTER HAVING AN INCIDENT WITH THE VACCINE IT WAS REALLY A HARD CHOICE IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT CAME EASY I DIDN'T PUT HER ON A PRO LONG SCHEDULE BECAUSE IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR ME. I DID IT BECAUSE I TRULY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF MY DAUGHTER WHILE STILL OBVIOUSLY WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HOW THE COMMUNITY AT THE SAME PLACE AS WELL AND SO. ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT NO HOME FOR NEEDS ARE I KNOW I'M FOR THIS ISSUE IS TOO AND SO MANY PEOPLE MY COLLEAGUE NEXT TO ME AS WELL I AM A HUGE FAN OF HOWEVER -- I HOPE YOU'RE LISTENING AND THAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE THAT ARE PART OF THIS BILL AND I REALLY DO THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR AT THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT YOU GUYS HAVE PUT INTO TO MAKING INTO MAKING THE ADJUSTMENTS. ON THIS BUT TODAY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I THINK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU PUT INTO IT SO FAR. ANYONE ELSE OTHER. JUST MAKE YOUR PARTS -- I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK -- FIRST OF ALL DR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRING THIS FOR IT I KNOW IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT IN THIS PART OF A DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT. THAT WE SIT HERE AND WE LISTEN AND WE TRY TO FIND OUT THE BEST SOLUTION. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW WAITED ON THIS I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR MANY OF US. LOVE LITTLE GIFTS SHOWED UP IN. BERMAN TO SUBJECT -- BUT I DO WANT. A BILL THE HOUSE WRITTEN -- BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS AND I WANT TO THANK MY CONSTITUENTS REBEKAH CAME AND TALKED TO MY OFFICE NUMEROUS TIMES IN -- THE MANAGER TERRY I THINK YOU REALLY DID A GOOD JOB AND IS THIS ALL ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION WHAT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE -- MAN MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE -- I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY HER TESTIMONY TODAY WAS WAS PHENOMENAL AND I HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT ON ON THOSE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ONES BUT AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING FOR THE FORD -- THIS BILL THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS WHEN WE RUN FOR OFFICE IT'S ALL ABOUT SAFETY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS WHEN THERE'S WATER LIGHT STREETS -- HEALTH THAT ALL COMES UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF WHAT OUR JOBS ARE HERE AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. MISTER IS THERE. THANK YOU STRUCTURE. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SPEAKER EARLIER BUT I WANTED TO GET A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FIRST -- MISTER PAN THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK A VERY MUCH VALUE YOUR TENACITY I ADMIRE YOUR BRING YOUR EXPERTISE TO TO THIS INSTITUTION AND AND I REALLY ADMIRE YOUR YOUR RELENTLESSNESS AND WANTING TO ADVANCE WHAT YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT. I REALLY DO VALUE THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE -- FOR I WAS VERY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON YOUR FIRST BILL. I VERY MUCH VALUE WHAT THAT DID I THINK IT ADDRESSED A LOT OF ISSUES. WHEN I ASKED LA USD TO PRODUCE THE NUMBERS? IT'S AT A ONE TO AT LEAST TWO IF NOT HIGHER THAN 2% INCREASE IN EVERY SEGMENT OF THE SIX SUBSECTIONS. OF LAUSD -- AVERAGE OF LA U. S. THE I BELIEVE IT'S SOMEWHERE ON UP MOST OF THE PLACES ARE ANYWHERE FROM 94% TO ABOUT 93% UNFORTUNATELY THE ONE SECTION WHICH IS THE WEST SIDE OF LA U. S. THE IS AT 87% AND THAT'S WHY IT'S WEIGHING DOWN THE AVERAGE OTHERWISE. AT TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WORKED -- INCREASE THE OUTCOMES OF IMMUNIZATION EVERYWHERE. AND WHEN I'M LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW. BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT. BUT FOR A FIVE AND A HALF HOURS MAYBE NO FIVE HOURS. FOUR O'CLOCK WE STARTED AS CRUZ COUNTY ARE. I'M TRYING TO JUST FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST WEEK AS WELL. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD DIDN'T GET RESOLVED. MY GOAL WAS IF WE'RE GONNA IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND I WOULD HAVE JOINED YOU AS A CO AUTHOR AGAIN. WHY NOT LOOK AT? THE PHYSICIANS. THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY CONDUCTING IN A WAY THAT WE WANT TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. IF THERE ARE PHYSICIANS THAT WE ARE AWARE OF WHO ARE OFFERING THESE EXEMPTIONS. WITHOUT EVEN SEEING THEIR PATIENT. WHY CAN'T WE ADDRESSING THAT DIRECTLY -- INSTEAD OF CREATING THIS PROCESS. THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH IT'S EVEN GONNA COST THE STATE. AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN SERVING HERE NOW FOR IN OUR FOURTH TERM. WE'VE AND AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND HEALTH RELATED ISSUES WILL CONSTANTLY WORK ON AREAS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND ONLY TO HAVE. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH COME IN SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE BILL'S LIFE AFTER WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK. AND SAY THERE'S A BIG COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. AND TURNING THE BILL AND THEN DOCTOR HAS TO TURN THE BILL INTO TO YOUR BILL WORK THROUGH THE VARIOUS AMENDMENTS WORK THROUGH THE VARIOUS ISSUES. UNTIL WE GET INTO A PLACE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AGAIN -- BUT YET IN THIS CASE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERCENTAGES [inaudible] THANK. WE WE SO. IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE WERE AT ABOUT POINT 17% NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN STUDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SCHOOL YEAR. AND IT'S GONE UP TWO POINT 7%. AROUND FOUR THOUSAND A HUNDRED STUDENTS. IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS ROUGHLY. OUT OF A POPULATION OF FORTY MILLION IN THE STATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TENS.OF A OF A HUNDREDTH OF A PERCENTAGE [inaudible] PERCENT POINT. SO THAT'S WHY I WAS ALSO ASKING WENT WITH WHEN MISS BURKE RIGHT AROUND NOW THAT RED WINE SOUNDS VERY GOOD BY THE WAY. WHEN MISS BURKE WAS ASKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS AGAIN I WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE? A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CASES IN THREE YEARS. I FEEL LIKE WE IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO WANT TO DO A STUDY AND ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT ARE THE REASONS WHY WE DON'T HAVE WATER THAN NON VACCINATION NUMBERS ATTRIBUTABLE? TO SO THAT WE COME UP WITH THE BEST PRACTICES SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ADDRESS WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND AND I DON'T WANT TO GO ON AND ON MISTER CHAIR BUT I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS. SO I I'M I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A BACK AND FORTH AND I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION AS WELL. SO WHENEVER YOU FEEL. HAPPY TO ALLOW THE AUTHOR. TO RESPOND OKAY SO ALL RIGHT SO I A HAVE YOU MADE A LAST STATEMENT SAY WHAT THIS AND I WILL LET ME DRESS THOSE I'M NOT SURE AND MUCH NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE QUESTION YOU WANT ANSWERED BUT FIRST OF ALL. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- DO WHAT DID YOU LIKE ME TO REPEAT JUST SO YOU KNOW WELL I KNOW I THINK IF YOU WANT TO JUST -- BUT LET ME JUST GO SEE IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS RIGHT AND FIRST OF ALL I I WOULD JUST POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL THE DENOMINATORS NOT THE ENTIRE POPULATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EACH ENTERING KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND A CHILD WHO HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- IS TO TRY AND LIKELY TO GET VACCINATED AND IF THEY HAVE A GENUINE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SHOULD BE VACCINATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR THEY HAVE A FROM THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I'M SORRY BUT I GOT TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE POINTING OUT TO THE EXAMPLES OF THE OUTBREAKS. DOES INCLUDE MANY ADULTS SO OKAY. LET ME LET ME AND THEN YOU GET TO THAT SO FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS -- WAS DOING ITS JOB ALL RIGHT -- EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR THREE YEARS NOW BUT WE ALSO NOTE WAS IS THAT THE SO WE AFTER -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE GOT THE MUSICIAN RATE -- FOR OVERALL ACROSS THE STATE ABOVE 95% -- FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT'S NOW ACTUALLY ENFORCING SLIP BELOW THAT -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THAT WE HAVE SCHOOLS OF MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES OF 10% OF OVER A HUNDRED SCHOOLS OVER 10% SO THE QUESTION IS IS AND IT'S NOT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT RATE IT'S THE SCHOOL RIGHT IN FACT THAT'S A TRIGGER ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL NOT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO YOU. MENTIONED THERE SOME SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR PARTS OF LA U. S. T. THAT HAVE LOWERED THAT THAT'S WHAT WOULD TRIGGER IT'S NOT THE OVERALL SCHOOL DISTRICT -- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT. MOST OF THE MORE READ THIS THIS YEAR'S IT ARE IN -- YOUNG ADULTS ACTUALLY -- SOMETIMES A CALL THAT THE WEEK FEEL GENERATION -- THOSE ARE THE FOR KIDS KIDS -- TO THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO THE REASON ARE NOW YOUNG ADULTS DATING GET VACCINATED WHEN THEY WERE. CHILDREN RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN ANDREW WAKEFIELD CAME OUT WITH THE STUDY THAT -- BASICALLY -- FALSELY CLAIMED THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM FRIGHTENED MANY OF PARENTS FROM WILL BE ON THEIR BACKS AND THEY'D BUT WELL UNFORTUNATELY NOT BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE UNVACCINATED CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING THE MEASLES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO SAW THIS BY THE WAY IN ENGLAND AS WELL HE'S -- SO SO SO YOU'RE RIGHT NOW OF A LOT OF THE CASES -- ARE IN YOUNG ADULTS IN TERMS OF THIS -- THIS PARTICULAR -- YEAR IN TERMS OF WE LOOK AT WHAT THE MEASLES CASES ARE. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE DON'T WANT TO GO ACTUALLY? YEAH ADD TO THE GROUP OF PEOPLE OR AN VACCINATED RIGHT SO IS AGAIN AS YOU MEMBERS A CO AUTHOR OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IT'S REALLY ADDRESSING IT YEAR BY YEAR SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WHEN WE SAY WHAT'S THE VACCINATION RATES REALLY ONLY THE VACCINATION RATE. FOR THE KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF THAT YEAR. YEAH I IT'S NOT THE VACCINATION RATE FOR ALL THE SUBSEQUENT YEAH ALL THE YEARS AHEAD OF THEM YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN THEY WERE KINDERGARTNERS THE END IDEA ABOUT ROUGHLY WHERE THEY ARE. YOU'RE RIGHT SOME YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S NOT ALL JUST ABOUT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS RIGHT SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS DONE IS WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO BE SURE. KIDS WHO HAD CONDITIONAL ONES THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWINGUP TO BE SURE THEY GOT THE REMAINDER OF THEIR VACCINATIONS RIGHT WE NEED TO BE SURE CHILDREN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHY WITH THE VACCINE FOR CHILDREN FIND WE'VE ACTUALLY SPEND IT -- ACCESS TO MEDICARE FOR FOR FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE TEN WHO WHO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT WAY THEY CAN GET THEIR VACCINES IT'S NOT A ECONOMIC BARRIER TO GET THE VACCINATIONS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE EXEMPTION RATE HAS QUADRUPLED AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY YOU ADD PERMANENT SO BY THE WAY IF YOU HAVE PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY. MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABOVE ONE POINT 1% AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGES THIS IF WE DO NOTHING AND IT KEEPS GOING UP AT THE CURRENT RATE. WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN THE SAME PROBLEM WE HAD THE FOUR TWO SEVEN SEVEN I MEAN. WE WE COULD YOU KNOW AND SO WE SEE THE TREND LINE MISTRANSLATED TREND LINES WHICH IS. CONTINUING TO INCREASE SO YEAH SO BUT PLEASE. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT SO WHY NOT FIRST FIGURE OUT WHY THE TREND IS GOING BACK UP AGAIN BECAUSE WE KNOW WHY THAT THE PAR PUBLIC HEALTH IS LOOK AT YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING FOR PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPIONS. MAY HAVE NOT WANTED TO GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO YEP. WE DON'T THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE STILL DON'T KNOW. SO INSTEAD OF JUMPING TO A LEGISLATIVE FIX WELL I I WOULD REFER YOU TO ACTUALLY RESEARCH DONE BY DOCTOR OVER SAY AT HIS TO LOOK AT THESE DATA THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS PAPERS PUBLISHED ABOUT WHAT'S. HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AFTER TWO SEVEN SEVEN BECAUSE AFTER ALL WE ARE THE FIRST STATE TO HAVE ROLLED BACK THE NONMEDICAL EXEMPTIONS SO RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT HAVE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE THING THEY MADE NOTE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT'S HAPPENED AFTER TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS A RISE IN? MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT IS THAT'S WHY THERE IS THAT STUDY AS FOLLOWS IN PEDIATRICS THE TALK -- TO COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS. WHO MAY KNOW THAT THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM BY THE WAY NOT EVERY PERSON IS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR FOR A FOR A COMPLAINT TO EAT WE NEED A ALWAYS HEARD FROM SCHOOL NURSES? WE UP PEOPLE LOOKED AT SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CONDITIONALS WHAT HAPPENS IS AS YOU JUST THE PAPER PUBLISHED. RECENTLY IN PEDIATRICS LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL CATEGORIES CALLED SUBSTITUTION EFFECT RIGHT SO WHO HAD PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTIONS BEFORE WHAT WAS THAT RATE NOW TO SEND SEVEN THAT'S DRIVEN THAT DOWN THE CENTURY THE ZERO SO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND BASICALLY THEY SAID IT'S BEING REPLACED BY. YOU KNOW SLOWLY OVER TIME BY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AS MEDICAL ATTENTION RATES HAVE BEEN INCREASING SO THE RESEARCH IS BEING DONE THERE IS THERE ARE PUBLISHED PAPERS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND THEN A FIVE THIS IS THE PROBLEM I DIDN'T DO THIS BILL RIGHT AFTER WE DID. TWO SEVEN SEVEN RIGHT WE HAVE TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE HAVE THREE YEARS OF DATA NOW AND THE REASON I'M DOING THIS BILL NOW IS WE HAVE A LARGE MEASLES OUTBREAK AND THE RESEARCH HAS COME OUT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED POST. TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND WHAT'S GOING ON ARE WE LOSING WHAT WE TRY. TO THE GOALS THAT WE TRIED TO ACHIEVE A TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND THE RESEARCH IS SAYING YES NO BECAUSE OF MEDICAL EXAMS I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE THE DATA IS ACTUALLY SHOWING THAT WERE IMPROVING. IMMUNIZATION IS ACTUALLY GONE UP NOW IF IF YOU'RE GONNA LET CERTAIN SUBSECTIONS. WILL WIN. THAT'S WHY I WAS REFERRING TO DALY U. S. THE NUMBERS WHEN I'M LOOKING AND SEEING THAT ALMOST EVERY SUBSECTION IN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL DISTRICT. HAS IMPROVED BY EITHER 2% 1% OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE 2% -- AGAIN THE EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE IN THE DISTRICT IS ABOVE 90% THE ONLY PLACE IS THE WEST SIDE WHICH IMPROVED FROM. WHICH ALSO IMPROVED BY A POINT BUT IT'S STILL BELOW 90% AND IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE HERD IMMUNITY LEVEL I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I WANT TO HELP. IN ADDRESSING THAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS NECESSARILY ADDRESSES IT WHEN IT GOES AFTER SUCH A SMALL SEGMENT. AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN GO AFTER YOU KNOW. TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER TO EDUCATION OR THROUGH OTHER INCENTIVES. AMONG THE NON COMPLIANCE STUDENTS AND PARENTS WERE KEEPING THEIR KIDS NON COMPLIANT. SO. I THINK WE HAVE JUST SUCH A BIGGER MARK THAT WE CAN BE GOING AFTER RATHER THAN LOOK AT THIS NARROW AREA. THAT THAT IT IT THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING STARTED BY ASKING WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT WERE AFTER BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO DISCIPLINE DOCTORS THE BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT -- BILL. I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN -- LET ME DOWN. PLEASE EDUCATE ME BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE HARSHEST. HARSHEST DISCIPLINE IS ACTUALLY TEND NOT ALLOW A DOCTOR. TO OF RIGHT EXEMPTIONS UP FOR TWO YEAR PERIOD. BLACK IS THAT IS THAT IS NOT THE HARSHEST THAT WE CAN DO. SO ACTUALLY THE REFERRAL TO THE MEDICAL RECORDS. SAID TO BE A FRAUDULENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FIRST OF ALL I DON'T EVEN SEE THE DEFINITION OF FRAUDULENT REALLY IN THE MET IN THE BILL SO. CAN WE MAYBE DISCUSS THAT AS WELL. I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW. YEAH. WHY DOESN'T THE BILL WHITE IS THE BILL HAVE A DEFINITION OF FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- REFERRING TO WHAT THE CDC ACAP AND EIGHTY P. CRITERIA. WOULD BE DENIED UNDER WHAT WHY IS IT THAT DAY AND WHAT THAT RIGHT TO BE A CHANGE OVER TIME SO AND JUST HEARING ROGER Là IS NOT IN THE BILL ANY LONGER. I I WOULD POINT OUT -- THE SENATE IS AREA AND THAT THE THE HIGHEST SANCTION WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE WHICH WOULD. MEAN YOU CAN'T PRACTICE ANYMORE AND OF COURSE LOTS OF THE LICENSE CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN YOU REFER TO THE TWO YEAR SUSPENSION THAT WAS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED LANGUAGE FOR REFERRAL TO THE MEDICAL BOARD YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT THEIR BIGGEST BARRIER IS. AN ABILITY TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED FOR THEIR INVESTIGATION THEY CAN'T EVEN GET OFF FIRST BASE AND SO THIS BILL. I CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO GET THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS THAT INVESTIGATION CAN LEAD EVENTUALLY. TO VARIOUS PENALTIES UP TO LOSS OF THE MEDICAL LICENSE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THAT POSITION COULD NO LONGER PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M NOT SURE WHAT IF THERE'S OTHER PENALTIES ONE SUGGEST -- YOU CAN -- PLEASE DO SO BUT I I THINK THAT THAT IS THE THE HYATT THAT IS THE SANCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR PHYSICIANS WHO ARE AT FOR FOR ACTING UNPROFESSIONALLY UNETHICALLY. I AM. I'M SORRY DOCTOR BUT THAT'S NOT VERY CONVINCING -- HI. I WOULD HAVE WELL KNOW HOW MANY LICENSES HAVE BEEN LOST. YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT THERE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE WELL I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IS CASES WERE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING COMPLAINTS ON MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND WHEN WE DO WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND MANY OF THESE CASES BECAUSE PARENTS AREN'T SIGNING. OFF ON RELEASING THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS SO THAT IS THAT THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE FACING RIGHT NOW SO WE DOING ANOTHER LEGISLATION TO ENSURE WERE. EXACTLY WHAT NOW SO BASICALLY ALLOW US TO GET THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS AND THEY WILL ALSO HAVE CD PIERCE COUNTY JUST TO LEGISLATION THAT EXACT IN A PRECISE WAY ALLOWS THAT. AUTHORIZES YOU AND GIVES YOU THE CAPABILITY OF DOING THE THINGS AS OPPOSED TO CREATING THIS PROCESS THAT. AT HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF WITH THIS IS POTENTIALLY GONNA MAN ON THIS IS NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEES THE POLICY COMMITTEE. OKAY HAS BEEN TO WITH BUSCA FISCAL COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE SO -- AND IT IS WITH US IT NOW AND THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE ABSOLUTELY TRUE. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT TO FEEL THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP A PROCESS THAT WHOSE COST WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THE VERY SMALL [inaudible] CONSTITUENCIES. VERSUS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ON A BIGGER PICTURE IF IF IF IF. MR SURE YOU DON'T MIND. I WANT TO KNOW FROM WHOEVER FROM THE OPPONENTS WANTS TO ANSWER. WHAT ENTAILS THE PROCEDURE EXAMINATION FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BASED ON FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY OR GENETICS TESTING THAT? YOU BELIEVE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE STATE UNDER THE CDC GUIDELINES IF SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THAT I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW. AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE SUPPORTERS FOR THE SAME QUESTION. SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE -- MEDICAL EXEMPTION UNDER FAMILY HISTORY. THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY UNDER CDC GUIDELINES. THE QUESTION. IS IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE CDC GUIDELINES ARE AND THAT THE SENATOR DID ANSWER ABOUT THE ONLY CDC FAMILY HISTORY GUIDELINE. IS IF A MOM OR DAD OR FIRST DEGREE RELATIVE HAS A SEVERE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. AND OF THE CHILDREN MIGHT HAPPEN. THE ONLY EXEMPTS YOU FROM MMR CHICKENPOX VACCINE. THAT'S THE ONLY FAMILY HISTORY FACTOR IN ALL THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE IN THIS BILL. THERE'S A SMALL FAMILIES YOU FACTOR ABOUT CAESAR'S OF SOMEONE'S HAD SEIZURES YOU CAN GET THIS ONE BRAND OF VACCINES. YOU CAN GET OTHER BROWN'S THAT THAT QUALIFY SO THAT DOESN'T WORK SO THERE'S ONLY ONE FAMILY HISTORY FACTOR. STUDENTS HAVE TO REALIZE FOR EXAMPLE ALL SEE A FAMILY. THE MOM HAD A SEIZURE AFTER VACCINES HER FIRST CHILD HAD A SEIZURE AFTER VACCINES -- AND SHE HAS A NEW BABY AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THAT BABY VACCINES AND OTHER DOCTOR I WOULD AGREE. THAT'S A GOOD FAMILY HISTORY REASON NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD -- OR MAYBE TO BE DELAY THEM DO A TOLL YEARS LATER I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE TEMPORARY EXEMPTION IS THEIR BABY. THERE IS NO SINGLE CDC GUIDELINES THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO WRITE THAT EXEMPTION UNDER THIS NEW LAW. DID NO FAMILY HISTORY INVOLVED WHATSOEVER THAT I THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ME WRITING EXEMPTION FOR THAT FAMILY BECAUSE THAT IS NOT IN THE CDC OR THE A. P. OR THE ACIP GUIDELINES. AND APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF ASKED A LOT ABOUT FAMILY HISTORY. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HOW NARROW THAT IS. THIS NEW AMENDMENT DID NOT BROUGHT IN THAT IN ANY WAY EXCEPT FOR THE SELECT FEW AS AS THE THE LADIES EXAMPLE -- RIGHT SO THERE'S SO MANY BUT I MEAN I COULD LIST SO MANY SEVERE REACTIONS OF SEEN MOMS OR DADS HAVE OR THEIR FIRST KIDS HAVE AFTER VACCINES. THAT I WILL USE AS LEGITIMATE FAMILY HISTORY TO WRITE AN EXEMPTION FOR NEW BABY IN THAT FAMILY. TELL IT ALL GO AWAY UNDER THIS NEW BUILD THOSE ALL BE DISQUALIFIED. THE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT TO THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. SIR BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE A A MOM YOUR EXPERIENCES EXACT THING AND WE LOVE. FOR YOU TO HEAR FROM HER IF YOU WOULD LIKE. MY SON WAS COMPENSATED BY THE VACCINE INJURY COURTS -- HE WAS ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED WITH SERUM SICKNESS AS A RESULT OF HIS EIGHTEEN MONTH WELL BABY VISIT -- VACCINES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- I FOUND WAS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING VACCINE ISSUES PRIOR TO THAT LAST REACTION THAT HE HAD THAT WAS HIS MOST SEVERE WHICH HAD HIM IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL FOR EIGHT LONG WEEKS -- HE WAS SEEN BY MULTIPLE SPECIALIST HE HAD SEIZURES HE HAD A A CONDITION CALLED THROMBOSIS I TOOK PINA CORPORATE WHERE HE LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BRUISING ALL OVER HIS BODY -- SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE WHOLE ENTIRE ON EIGHT WEEKS THAT WE WERE IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND SPECIALISTS OFFICE NOT ONE OF THOSE -- THE SPECIALIST -- WELL ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY ASKED ME IF HE HAD A HISTOGRAM A HISTORY OF SITS IN OUR FAMILY IF WE HAD A HISTORY OF AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS IN THE FAMILY IF HE HAD. EXISTING AUTO IMMUNE CONDITIONS AND WHEN I ASKED WHY IT WAS THAT THEY WERE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS THEY SAID THAT THOSE WERE ALL COUNTRY INDICATIONS OF VACCINE REACTIONS. THEY ALSO ASKED ME IF HE HAD PRIOR VACCINE REACTIONS I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD OR NOT I DUTIFULLY TOOK MY CHILD IN FOR EVERY WELL BABY VISIT HADN'T VACCINATED. WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS THAT -- THE IMMUNOLOGIST -- HAD SUGGESTED THAT WE CROSS REFERENCE HIS RECORD GET HIS MEDICAL RECORDS AND CROSS REFERENCES VACCINE RECORDS TO ALL OF THE TIMES THAT HE WAS ADMITTED INTO THE MURDER ZERO OR HAD -- ON SCHEDULE OF A DOCTOR'S VISIT WE ENDED UP FINDING OUT THAT HE HAD -- WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS HE HAD SYMPTOMS THAT MATCHED THE HEPATITIS B. MANUFACTURE INSERTS AND THE HIS TWELVE MONTH BABY VISIT -- MANUFACTURE INSERTS AS WELL -- AND OF COURSE AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD HE THE REACTIONS THAT HE WAS SHOWING WHICH THEY DID DETERMINE WERE A RESULT OF THOSE VACCINES -- ALSO MATCH THE MANUFACTURE INSERTS FOR THE SYMPTOMS -- ALL OF THOSEINCIDENTS WERE VIABLE IN TERMS OF THE VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM. AND I DID -- HE WAS AWARDED THROUGH THE VACCINE COURT AND THERE WAS ONLY A FEW. DOCTORS THAT ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON SO WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING TO THE FACT I FORGET WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE SPECIALIST -- WHO UNDERSTAND VACCINE INJURY [inaudible] MY CHILD. HAD TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL VACCINE INJURIES WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT ACTIONS I KNOW THAT MOST OF US KNOW WHEN WE TAKE OUR CHILD AND IF NOT USUALLY JUST ONE VACCINE THAT YOU'RE GETTING. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH MY CHILD AND THE REASON THAT HE ENDED UP RECEIVING I'M A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WHICH WAS PRIOR TO SB TWO SEVEN BEFORE ALL OF THIS LEGISLATION START HAPPENING. WAS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT NOT ONE MEDICAL EXPERT COULD PINPOINT WHAT COMPONENT OF WHICH VACCINE HE RECEIVED BECAUSE OF THE REACTION BECAUSE WE RECEIVE SO MANY DIFFERENT. VACCINES AND MOST CHILDREN DO AT A BABY VISIT THEY DON'T NESTING AND I MEAN WE DON'T NORMALLY GET ONE TAXING IN A BABY VISIT THERE'S USUALLY OF MANY VACCINES. SO WITH THAT HE WAS GIVEN A PERMIT -- MEDICAL EXEMPTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT NO ONE COULD TELL ME WHAT COMPONENT OF THE VACCINES AND I FOUND OUT THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A REACTION -- TO THE FETAL CELLS THAT WERE THERE ON THEIR IN VACCINES IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT -- OTHER TOXINS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS NO ONE COULD TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS SO WITH THAT HE HAD TO HAVE -- AIDS VACCINE -- EXEMPTION FOR ALL VACCINES AND THE IMMUNOLOGIST HAD SAID THAT THE NEXT SHOT COULD KILL HIM. SO AT THIS POINT SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS FORCING ME TO DECIDE ON CHOOSING BETWEEN MY SON'S EDUCATION AT AND HIS LIFE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. WITH US AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE EITHER SO -- SO FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW ITS -- A APPRECIATE THE THE PRESENTATION I YOU KNOW I I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF STATEMENTS THAT -- THAT ARE MADE THAT -- DO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS -- SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE THE PRESENTATION -- CERTAINLY I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO GET MORE -- INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THIS CASE I I DO -- YELLED Là THINGS ARE MENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE INSERTS SAID SO WE KNOW THAT SINCE RATES HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN THERE NOW SAYS WHO VACCINES. ALL RIGHT SO SAID RATES OF WE GOING DOWN WITH INCREASED VACCINATION RATES. WE TALK ABOUT TOXINS IN THE VACCINE -- ACTUALLY THE LOW FOR MALAHIDE IN A VACCINE IS -- LESS THAN WHAT IN A PAIR THAT YOU EACH AND BY THE WAY YOUR BODY NORMALLY PRODUCES FORMALDEHYDE AS A BY PRODUCT OF METABOLISM -- THERE ARE NO FETAL CELLS IN VACCINES SO THAT'S A ALL RIGHT YES PLEASE KEEP. PLEASE. OKAY SO YOU SOME SO SOME OF THIS THE VACCINES ARE DEVELOPED. INITIALLY USED IN FUEL CELLS FOR DEVELOP VACCINE. THOSE ARE CONTINUE CULTURED AND AGAIN THEY'RE NOT WHOLE CELLS AND VACCINES -- AND THEY'RE COMPLETELY WATCH SO -- INSERTS BASICALLY IF ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE FTA WORKS AND INSERTS BASICALLY THEIR REPORTS OF ANY -- EVENTS NOT NOT ASSOCIATE A SAID WITHOUT CAUSALITY ANY OF THAT THAT HAPPENS DURING. CLINICAL EVALUATION SO IF YOU'RE IN A CAR ACCIDENT. AND YOU GET INJURED THAT GOES INTO THE INSERTS IF YOU'RE A PARTICIPANT IN THE EVALUATION OF THAT -- MEDICATION -- INCLUDING A VACCINE -- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF STATEMENTS IN THERE THAT -- RAISE SOMEQUESTIONS I CERTAINLY WHY IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EXACTLY WHAT -- WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CHILD BUT I I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- IN TERMS OF THAT EVALUATION I MEAN WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS IS THAT -- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE SCIENCE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AND I SAID BEFORE WE GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. BASED ON THE SCIENCE AND THE EVIDENCE TO THE CHILD SO IF WE HAPPEN TO KNOW. WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT. THERE IS SOME OTHER CAUSE FOR THE EVENTS. ARE OF WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE VACCINE BECAUSE THERE'S EXISTING RESEARCH SHOWS IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT. IF WE'RE NOT SURE BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO RESEARCHERS THINGS WE DON'T KNOW THEN YES I THINK WE SHOULD -- GIVE SOME BENEFIT THE DOUBT IN FACT THAT IS -- BY THE WAY HOW WHEN THEY SET UP THE GUIDELINES THAT'S GENERALLY HOW THEY LOOK AND THAT'S HOW EXPECT A REIEW PANEL WILL ACT AS WELL. I THINK THAT CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- ONE DO THAT IF YOU HAVE YOUR FOLLOWING AN IMMUNOLOGIST AT UCSF WHO HAS WHAT IS SAYS THAT YOU HAVE A RARE IN YOU CAN JUST BUY ALL YOU DON'T EVEN NEED AND HAVE A DIAGNOSIS IF YOU SAID LOOK. I'M AN IMMUNOLOGIST AT UCSF HERE'S THE WORK I'VE BEEN DOING I FOLLOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THESE IMMUNE CHALLENGES OF STILL WORKING IT OFF AND I THINK THERE'S A CONCERN BECAUSE I'M WORKING UP I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS. THAT PERSON SHOULD WILL GET. A MEDICAL EXEMPTION I MEAN THAT THAT IS WHAT A THAT'S WHY WHEN WAS THIS IS GET TOGETHER WE SAY OKAY WELL LET'S WHAT ARE WE GOING WHAT SHOULD WE DO RIGHT -- IF SOMEONE SAYS THAT -- YOU KNOW MY I A CHILD WHO DIED OF SIDS. AND I DON'T OF X. NIGHT MIGHT FUTURE CHILD NEXT CHILD. I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION THERE BECAUSE THERE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SITS IN VACCINES IN FACT BACKS -- SITS RATES HAVE FALLEN -- WITH ENTRIES VACCINATION ARGUE SAID I HAVE A CHILD WITH AUTISM BY THE WAY IT'S STUDY HAS BEEN DONE. ALREADY BEEN DONE SAYING THAT LOOK WE LOOK AT SIBLINGS OF CHILDREN THE AUTISM TO SEE WHETHER DAY ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF AUTISM THEN -- THAT AFTER B. C. VACCINES BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL MAYBE THERE'S A GENETIC COMPONENT -- TO AUTISM AND THEY HAVE FOUND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE AND THEREFORE JUST BEING A SIBLING OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE A REASON -- TO GET AN EXEMPTION FOR VACCINE OR DEVOID VACCINATION SO IF WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE'S ON THE STUDY AND THEY FOUND THE RESULT WE NEED TO ACCEPT IT THE ONLY OF THE SCIENCE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. IF WE IF IT IF THERE'S A QUESTION SURE WE SHOULD GET THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO THE CHILD. CAN I JUST AND I'M SORRY I WENT TO WAS RESERVE [inaudible] ADD SOMETHING. MR SURE IF YOU DON'T MIND BY THANK YOU. OKAY I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- MY SON'S SETTLEMENT WAS NOT BASED ON THE CC PINK BOOK AND IN THE FEDERAL VACCINE COURT THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE CDC PINK BOOK THEY HAVE A SEPARATE. VACCINE INJURY TABLE THAT THEY GO BY IN TERMS OF QUALIFYING IN AWARDING -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD VACCINE INJURIES SO THE LIST OF OF THE CDC GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN SB. TWO SEVEN SIX THEY ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDERED IN THE COURT OF A VACCINE I MEAN THEY'RE NOT EVEN CONSIDERED IN VACCINE COURT. THOSE ARE NOT THE SYMPTOMS THAT THEY GO BY IN ORDER TO AWARD PEOPLE -- AND IN TERMS OF SB TWO SEVEN SIX IF I WERE TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD MY SON I ME MINE MY NEXT CHILD WOULD NOT BE WOULD NOT QUALIFY UNDER SB TWO SEVEN SIX EITHER. SO SHE'S REFERRING TO THE NEXT NATIONAL VACCINE -- COMPENSATION THERE RIGHT AWAY THAT IS A NO FAULT -- SYSTEM THOSE ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN FACT YOU EVEN HEARD. SOMEONE TESTIFY WE SHOULD ACTUALLY REPEAL THAT -- SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT -- THEIR PEOPLE WANT IT REPEALED -- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- THAT'S A NO FAULT COMPENSATION SYSTEM THERE ARE WHAT THEY CALL TABLE INJURIES -- SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A TABLE INJURIES IS THAT IF YOU RECEIVE VACCINE AND YOU FAINTING YOU FALL YOU GET COMPENSATED FOR THAT INJURY RIGHT -- DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T SIN GET FUTURE VACCINES BECAUSE YOU FAINTED WHEN YOU GOT THE VACCINE SO THAT THAT THE TABLE INJURIES ARE A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF THINGS THEN THINGS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE SOME OF THE TABLE INJURIES. ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE THINGS THAT MIGHT RESULT THAT MIGHT BEEN SO SEATED WITH THE VACCINE BUT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS IS A SITE A FACTOR -- ADVERSE EFFECT OF THE VACCINATION SO I THINK WE JUST NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT -- THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE ARE USED BY THE WAY -- MOST OF THE MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO -- RECEIVE COMPENSATION IT'S WITHOUT CAUSALITY. RIGHT AND IN FACT SO IT'S IT'S SO YOU CAN GET COMPENSATION WITHOUT CAUSALITY YOUR LEGAL FEES ARE PAID -- FOR EVEN IF YOU LOSE YOUR CASE -- SO IT IS THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO PEOPLE WHO -- YEAH MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED AS SOME KIND OF DAMAGE. AT THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ASSOCIATE THE VACCINE BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NOT PROVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HI YOU KNOW. DOCTOR PAN AGAIN I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TENACITY AND YOU ARE GOING TO RESPOND TO EVERY POINT -- AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS NOT A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE. AND AND SCIENCE CHANGES. EVERY BASS LINO THAT BETTER THAN I DO EVEN. YOU YOU LIVE AND BREATHE AND WORK THIS. SO I'M NOT GONNA. SEE MORE ON THAT IT JUST I I FEEL THAT THIS IS OVER REACHING IF THE INTENT OF THIS TO GO WAS TO GO AFTER. DOCTORS WHO ARE ERRONEOUSLY OFFERING [inaudible] EXEMPTIONS -- I I DON'T I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT. THEN CREATING THIS SITUATION THAT WILL FOCUS SO MUCH MONEY ON SUCH A SMALL AREA. AND I REALLY DO WISH YOU WOULD CONSIDER -- MAKING FURTHER CHANGES TO THIS BECAUSE I WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO SUPPORT IT BUT AS IT STANDS NOW I STILL. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE BEFORE. FIRST OFF. THANK YOU -- TO EVERYONE -- AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE YOU PERSONALLY DOCTOR PAN -- I SHOULDN'T I SHOULD INTERVENE WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO PERSONALLY ATTACK YOU AND I DIDN'T UNTIL LATER AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE. YOU DON'T LIKE OUR BILL THAT'S ONE THING BUT YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE PERSON CERTAINLY NOT IN OUR HOUSE I DON'T FIND THAT APPROPRIATE AND I APOLOGIZE YOU PERSONALLY FOR THAT -- I DON'T FIND THAT ACCEPTABLE ANYWHERE -- IN OUR BUSINESS. I WANT TO I WANT TO HIT ON A VARIETY OF THINGS HERE AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT BUT A LOT SAID IN -- THE PATIENCE IS RUNNING THIN AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME -- BUT I WANNA I WANNA I WANNA HAVE A COUPLE THINGS AND THE REASON I ASK IS THE MEDICAL BOARD TO STAY HERE HAVE A QUESTION -- OF OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND THAT IS OF THE CASES THAT ARE BEING AND INVESTIGATED OR HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED HOW MANY OF THOSE CASES WERE SUCH THAT. THAT EXEMPTIONS WERE PROVIDED WITH OUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE PATIENT. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH ME WITHOUT TAKE A MANUAL LOOK THROUGH THE INVESTIGATIONS TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT BACK OUR SECOND SAID ALRIGHT. AND YET MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT -- SO BUT IS THAT IS THAT PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN SOME OF THE ON GOING INVESTIGATIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN EXAMINED THAT MAYBE IT'S A TELEPHONE CONSOLE TO WORK. OR EVEN LESS THAN THAT I MEAN I THINK I AM GENERALLY SPEAKING AS INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL BUT IN SOME CASES AND YES THE THE APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW EXAM HAS NOT HAPPENED BUT THAT'S IN THE THIS CASE IS IN. ANOTHER CASES LIKE OPIOID PRESCRIBING CASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YEAH I BELIEVE THAT IN THESE CASES THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS BUT LIKE I SAID TO ACTUALLY GET NUMBERS OUT HAVE UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THE CONFIDENTIALITY ABOUT SO -- WELL TODAY OBVIOUSLY THE A LOT OF TALK IS AROUND MEASLES -- AND AND THE MMR -- IN PARTICULAR -- I HAVE CONCERNS -- AND A PRODUCT FROM A BROADER PERSPECTIVE -- I THINK OF FOR EXAMPLE -- WHEN I PRACTICED DENTISTRY -- SEEN PATIENTS WHO HAD -- ADULT PATIENTS OLDER ADULT PATIENTS WHO HAD POST POLIO SYNDROME -- THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT SURVIVED POLIO -- HAD COMPROMISED LIVES AND AS THEY GOT OLDER THEY EXPERIENCED WASTING OF THE MUSCLES IN ABILITY TO FUNCTION WELL THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WAS PRETTY AWFUL. NOW MOST THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE PROBABLY. DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT POLIO BUT IT IS A IT IS A SERIOUSLY DEBILITATING DISEASE WHAT PEOPLE DIED IMPRINT WITH POLIO. AND AND WE HAVE NEARLY ERADICATED POLIO FROM THE PLANET WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE COUNTRIES. YET I FEAR THAT WILL GO BACKWARDS THAT WILL BRING POLIO BACK. TO TO TO TO THE U. S.. AND I AND THAT THAT THAT THAT CONCERNS ME ALSO CONCERNS ME IN TALKING -- TO TALKING TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL RECENTLY. WHEN A I'M A MOTHER MIGHT TAKE A CHILD TO A -- TO A GROCERY STORE AN INFANT. MAYBE ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS OLD MAYBE YOU KNOW I'D. PURSUANT TAKEN AND FAN OUT THAT YOUNG BUT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT. AND THERE COULD BE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IN YOUR ON IMMUNIZED WHO MAY HAVE PER TOSSES. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THAT INFANT WHO CAN'T BE IMMUNIZED AT FIFTEEN DAYS OR WHATEVER. IS VERY VERY SERIOUS. AND SO WE ALSO TALK ABOUT I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY I HAD MEASLES AND YOU KNOW I'M FINE AND I HAD MONTHS I'M FINE. BUT IT IS A SERIOUS. ILLNESS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITH COMPLICATIONS LIGHT HEARING LOSS -- LIKE VISION LOSS OR LIKE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED YEARS AFTER THEY HAVE HAD THE MEASLES AND IT CAN BE TRCED BACK TO HAVING HAD THE MEASLES. SO SO TO PUT COULD THIS IS AS A INNOCENT CONDITION OF CHILDHOOD IS I THINK IS IS MISTAKEN. ASK THE THAT'S THE YOUNG CHILD WHO SPENT FIVE FOR FIVE DAYS AND I SEE YOU AND IN OREGON -- WITH COMPLICATIONS FROM THE MEASLES HOUSE IN SERIOUS THAT IS -- AND AND SO IT IS IT IS HERE IS RIGHT AND I DO SO I DO TAKE YEAH I DO TAKE UMBRAGE WITH PEOPLE DO KIND OF POOH POOHED THIS AS AS NOT BEING SERIOUS. I THINK THE CRITICAL THING I'VE HEARD ALSO THAT -- WELL YOU KNOW WE GOT 95% YOU KNOW IMMUNITY THEREFORE IT'S ALL GOOD IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY IT'S REGIONAL IT'S BY SCHOOL IS BY YOUR COMMUNITY IT'S BY YOUR CHURCHES BY YOUR PLAYGROUP IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS. AND WHEN I THINK OF LISTENING LISTENING TO LACI WAS NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SHE'S JUST CONCERNED ABOUT AN EXEMPTION THAT WOULD PROTECT HER. BECAUSE IF THERE ARE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IMMUNIZED. SHE'S AT RISK. HER BECAUSE HER CHILDREN COULD CONTRACT THE DISEASE BECAUSE WE'VE ARMY AS ASCERTAIN THEIR CHILDREN SHOULDN'T GET THE EXIT COULD SHOULD GET THESE. SO. THE END OF IT THE THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE THE OR THE THE DESIRE PEOPLE TO NOT IMMUNIZE OUR CHILDREN PUTS OTHER KIDS AT RISK WITH LACI AT RISK. AND SO THAT'S A SERIOUS THAT'S A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT I HAPPENINGS. IT'S MY TURN THANK YOU -- I HAVE A AYE DATA HERE -- AND THAT SAYS THAT WE HAVE -- FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE SCHOOLS AMONG THE FIFTEEN MEMBERS THAT IMMUNIZATION RATES LESS THAN 95%. A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE SCHOOLS FIFTEEN MEMBERS THAT'S ABOUT. TEN PER MEMBER ROUGHLY. WE GOT ONE MEMBER WHO HAS ONE SCHOOL. WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER BEST. THIRTY TWO THIS IS CLEARLY NOT DISPERSED EVENLY ACROSS THE POPULATION. THIS IS REGIONAL THIS IS LOCAL AND THIS IS THIS THIS IS A CHALLENGE WHAT'S MORE DISTURBING TO ME. IS THAT WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE REPORTED AT ALL EVEN THOUGH IT'S REQUIRED. MATTER FACT THAT NUMBER MAY APPROACH A THOUSAND THERE MAY BE A THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT REPORTING THE IMMUNIZATION. THE PROBLEM COULD BE BIGGER THAN WE ACTUALLY KNOW. AND THAT AND THAT THAT TROUBLES THAT TROUBLES ME AS WELL. SO -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT SAID HERE TODAY THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON THIS WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS BILL. SENSE YOU INTRODUCED IT SENATOR PAP. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL AND THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL SINCE IT WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE. AND OTHER PEOPLE OF ENGAGE IT MINISTRATION IS ENGAGE THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ENGAGED WE BELIEVE. THAT WE ARE AT A PLACE THAT THIS IS THIS THROUGH THE OUR PROCESS IS A IS A BETTER BILL I STILL THINK YOU HAVE A HER CONCERN AND AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN OF LACI. CAN THERE BE A WAY TO ADDRESS HER CONCERN AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU. YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND AND AND WE WILL WE WILL DO THAT. SO THIS IS AYE KNOWS A LOT OF EMOTION HERE -- AND AND A LOT OF CHALLENGES HERE AND IT IS DIFFICULT AND AND BEING SOMEONE WHO -- HAS BEEN IN THE MEDICAL FIELD FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. HI -- I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS TRUSTED AS PRINT PRACTITIONERS. WITHOUT A WAS TRUST IS. SO I DO WANT TO SAY -- BEFORE -- BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE I WANNA -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO CAME HERE TODAY I KNOW ANY PEOPLE TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES -- SUPPORT AND THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION -- AND I APPRECIATE -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. WELL I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY -- AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU -- AS IF THE BILL WAS FOR TODAY AND I THINK YOU -- FOR YOUR PERSEVERANCE -- AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO YOUR COMMUNITY. AND WITHOUT IT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE. THANK YOU -- DOCTOR CHAIR AND I FIRST OF ALL -- I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND WE'VE HAD A VERY -- ROBUST DISCUSSION I WANNA THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF CAYMAN TRAVEL TO TESTIFY ON THE BARE BILL AND EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS -- SO THE WITNESSES I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF YOU AS WELL -- BOTH -- FOR THE MEETINGS WE'VE HAD TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL AND THEN OF COURSE THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD HERE AT THIS HEARING. AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS SOMEONE THANK. YOU CHAIR WORDS IN YOUR STAFF THAT HELPED ME STAFF -- FOR THE FOR THE TREMENDOUS WORK I KNOW THAT IN EVEN IN THE MIDDLE AS WE'RE TRYING TO THE BUDGET EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE SPENDING MANY HOURS HAMMERING OUT. SPECIFICS WITH THE BILL AND ALSO ONE OF RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY GOLLY AND HIS TEAM AS WELL AS WE HAD SERVICE TRIPARTITE TO A DISCUSSION AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT HE IS LOOKING. FOR TO A SIGNING THIS BILL WHEN IT LANDS ON HIS DESK SO. DESIGN BRIEFLY SAY THIS IS REALLY ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. RIGHT WE WANT TO BE SURE WE GIVE EVERYONE AS MUCH FREEDOM AS POSSIBLE WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL CHILDREN THAT INCLUDES. THE CHILDREN WHO GENUINELY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT PROTECTION FROM THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR SCHOOL. AND THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY PART BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE OVERSIGHT UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN WE WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE CLAIM THERE'S NO FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WELL I THINK THE MEDICAL BOARD OF BEG TO DIFFER I THINK OUR PUB COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER TO BEG TO DIFFER OUR SCHOOL NURSES WOULD. BEG TO DIFFER THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THAT PROBLEM IS ERODING THE GAINS THAT WE ACHIEVE A TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS PEOPLE HAVE DONE RESEARCH I DIDN'T. SUBMIT THIS DO A BILL RIGHT AWAY AND SAID WELL THERE'S A LOOPHOLE ON SCHOOL CLOSE IT WE WAITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WE HAD RESEARCHERS LOOK AT THE DATA. WE HAD PEOPLE LOOK AT THE DATA AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT TO FOR THE PROBLEM TO GET WORSE WE ALREADY HAVE ON THE LARGEST MEASLES OUTBREAKS CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY SHOWN IT'S BEEN THAT RESIST NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD IT OFF. BUT WE WANNA STAY THAT WAY WE DON'T WANT THAT TO GO AWAY AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD TO ACTUALLY NEED WHO TRULY NEEDS MEDICAL EXEMPTION. SURE THEY GET THE MEDICAL SENTIENT AND THEY'RE SAFE AND THEY'RE IN SCHOOL BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY S.
