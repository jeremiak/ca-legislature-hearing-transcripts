AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETING. I'M. GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED I WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START AS A SUB COMMITTEE. I YOU'VE GOT AUTHORS PRESENT READY TO ADD READY TO PRESENT MR BLOOM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBER -- I MET HERE TO PRESENT -- A. B. SIX FIFTY THREE WHICH WILL AUTHORIZE THE DIRECTOR GENERAL SERVICES TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF LA FOR ONE POINT THREE ACRES OF THE WEST LOS ANGELES NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY SAY. THE COUNTY OF LA UNDER THE STATE LEADERSHIP SUPERVISOR SHEILA KEWL HAS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF BEEN WORKING. WITH RELEVANT CITY STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND MY OFFICE TO DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY OF BUILDING BRIDGE HOUSING SITE ON THIS PROPERTY. THE WEST LOS ANGELES ARMORY IS SITUATED WITHIN SERVICE PLANNING AREA FIVE FOUR SPOT FIVE AS WE CALL IT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. COVERING MOST OF THE WEST SIDE AND IT SPANS SOME OF THE AS YOU AS YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THE HIGHEST PROPERTY VALUE AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY INTERIM HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO THE OUTRAGEOUS COST OF LAND IN OUR ALREADY DANCE REGION. AND SO THIS PROJECT -- WOULD BE A IT'S REALLY HARD TO A IMAGINE THIS THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST BRIDGE HOUSING SITE FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SPA. FIVE IN OVER TWENTY YEARS THAT -- SPANS THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME THAT I'VE BEEN AN ELECTIVE OFFICE -- AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AS AN ISSUE FOR ALL OF THOSE YEARS SO FOR ME -- THIS JUST A REMARKABLE STATISTIC WITH BUILT OUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE AREA BUT BRIDGE HOUSING IS A PLACE WHERE -- WE'VE REALLY FALLEN BEHIND. THE S. SPECIFIC TO THE PROJECT ARE BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE COUNTY ARCHITECT AS THE NATIONAL GUARD. AND DESIGN SHOULD BE COMPLETED OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. CONCEPTUAL DRAWINGS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE INTERIM IN AN EFFORT TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SO THAT -- DISCUSSIONS SUCK A CAN PROCEED WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND THE PROPERTY. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A PARKING REPLACEMENT -- THEY'LL BE A PARKING STRUCTURE WHERE THE SURFACE LOT ALREADY EXISTS -- TO ASSIST THE NATIONAL GUARD IN ALLEVIATING THEIR OWN -- A PARKING ISSUES. AND ALL PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PROJECT WILL BE A MAJOR ENHANCEMENT TO THE SITE. THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I'VE INTRODUCED THIS BILL SO THAT WHEN THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE AGREED UPON WE'LL BE ABLE TO BREAK GROUND THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF THIS LEASE. AND TO GET THOSE -- GET GET THESE OF FACILITIES ONLINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- WITH ME TODAY ARE STEPHANIE COHEN A WHO IS -- WITH SUPERVISOR SHEILA KILLS OFFICE AND FORMERLY OF OF OF ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES OFFICES SHE'S VERY WELL TRAINED -- AND BROOKS LESSER WITH THIS -- THE PEOPLE CONCERNED ONE OF THE PREMIER ALMOST SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THE WEST SIDE. OF WILL BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM -- FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY AND FOR INTRODUCING AB. SIX FIVE THREE AS MR BLOOM MENTIONED SUPERVISOR KILLS OFFICE STARTED DISCUSSION ON THIS PROJECT ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO ALLEVIATE A SERIOUS SHELTER CRISIS IN SERVICE PLANNING AREA. FIVE THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITIES TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN POINT IN TIME CAL. FOUND THAT THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS ON SHELTERED IN SERVICE AREA. FIVE AND ONLY FIFTEEN BEDS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH NO SPECIALIZED CATEGORY SUCH AS VETERAN TRANSISTOR NEEDS TO YOUTH AND FAMILIES. THIS IS A STRIKINGLY LOW NUMBER IN COMPARISON TO THE SERVICE AREAS THAT BORDER FIVE FOR EXAMPLE. IN SERVICE AREA FOR WE HAVE ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED BADS AND IN SERVICE SERVICE AREA TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED BEDS. IT OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN UTILIZING THE WEST LA ARMORY MULTI PURPOSE ROOM INSIDE OF THE BUILDING -- FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS TO HOUSE THE WINTER SHELTER PROGRAM A NIGHTLY PROGRAM SERVING ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUALS DURING THE COLDER MONTHS OF NOVEMBER TO MARCH. WELL THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS A WARM PLACE TO SLEEP THE OUTCOMES FROM WINTER SHELTER MODELS ARE VERY MODEST. IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MOVE TO EXAMINE ALL WINTER SHELTERS IN THE COUNTY TO DETERMINE. IF THEY COULD BETTER SERVE THE GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION BY BECOMING YOUR AROUND TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BRIDGE HOUSING THAT INCLUDES INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BRIDGE HOUSING MODELS HAVE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER RATES OF PLACING CLIENTS IN PERMANENT HOUSING AND IN THEIR HOMELESSNESS. AS SUCH AS MISTER BILLY MENTION WE WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BLOOMING KAMLAGER-DOVE. AND OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS US SENATORS FEINSTEIN AND HARRIS AND CONGRESSMAN WILL TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DESIGNING A PROJECT FOR REVIEW. I BROUGHT THIS BOARD HERE JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE PROPERTY LOOKS LIKE AND TO LET YOU KNOW -- WHERE ON THE PROPERTY WERE PROPOSING TO BUILD? SO IT WOULD BE THE TOP LEFT CORNER WHICH IS THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE PROPERTY. AND SO THE CURRENT PROPOSALS TO BUILD A NEW STRUCTURE IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE PROPERTY WITH A SEPARATE SEPARATE ENTRY ACCESS WAY FROM THE ROAD -- THIS WOULD ALLOW THE STRUCTURE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD OPERATIONS TO BE COMPLETELY SEPARATED. THIS FACILITY WOULD SERVE INDIVIDUAL MEN AND WOMEN ON DIFFERENT FLOORS AND WE'RE STARTING IN NUMBER OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEDS FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS FOR NOW. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD SIZE FOR WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY COST EFFECTIVE BRIDGE HOUSING. THE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THIS PROJECT HAS NOT YET BEEN SELECTED BUT THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY HAS A LIST OF APPROVED OPERATORS THAT WE MAY SELECT FROM. ONE OF THESE APPROVED OPERATORS. AND IN ALREADY INCREDIBLE OPERATOR IN SERVICE PLANNING AREA FIVE AND SERVICE PLANNING AREA FOR IS THE PEOPLE CONCERNED. THE PEOPLE CONCERNED PROVIDES A WIDE ARRAY OF INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS MENTAL HEALTH. ACCESS CENTERS AND HAVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MANAGING BURRS BRIDGE HOUSING LOCATIONS. WITH US TODAY ALSO IS -- BROOKS LESSER CHIEF. PROGRAMS OFFICER WITH THE PEOPLE CONCERNED AND IT'S TO CHILL SHALL SPEAK TO BRIDGE HOUSING MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND AND HOW THIS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY IN GETTING FOLKS REHABILITATING TRANSITIONED INTO PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MEMBERS I LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER BROOKS COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR PRESENTING AB -- SIX FIVE THREE STAFFING A PROJECT TO LIKE THIS KIND OF BRIDGE HOUSING PROJECT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MEET BOTH THE SHORT TERM CRISIS NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS. AND THE LONG TERM GOAL OF COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION WHILE MAINTAINING THE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND WELLNESS. A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF CASE MANAGERS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO ASSIST TO ASSESS FOR UNMET NEEDS OF PARTICIPANTS AND EITHER A DRESSER MANAGE. THESE NEEDS OR MAKE APPROPRIATE LINKAGES WHETHER IT BE FOR MEDICAL CARE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENTS OR SAYS FOR OTHER BARRIERS TO NAVIGATING THROUGH THE HOUSING PROCESS. HOUSING NAVIGATORS SERVER CRITICAL ROLE IN WALKING PARTICIPANTS TO THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH. FROM GATHERING NECESSARY DOCUMENTS TO APPLY FOR HOUSING OPTIONS THROUGH THE HOUSING SEARCH AND FINALLY THROUGH THE LEASE SIGNING PROCESS. AS ONE COULD IMAGINE THIS CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AND TRIGGERING JOURNEY AND SO HAVING A SERVICE PROVIDER TO ASSIST TO ASSIST WITH ADDRESSING THESE BARRIERS THE MOMENT THEY ARISE IS CRITICAL. NECESSARY SERVICES INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CASE MANAGEMENT TO WORK TOWARDS THE CONCRETE GOALS OF SECURING PERMANENT HOUSING SKILL BUILDING GROUPS TO ASSIST PARTICIPANTS WITH DEVELOPING THE NECESSARY BUILDING BLOCKS TO BEING A GOOD TENANT. AND A GOOD NEIGHBOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP COUNSELING TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES THAT IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER FROM HOMELESSNESS. AS A RESULT OF HOW IN DEPTH THIS WORK CAN BE AND HOW LENGTHY THE HOUSING PROCESS CAN BE AS WELL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS. BE ABLE TO WORK WITH BRIDGE HOUSING RESIDENTS BE ON THEIR EXIT FROM THE HOUSING UNTIL THEY FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY. FOR SOME THIS IS A SIMPLE AND AS QUICK AS THE LEAST SIGNING PROCESS WHILE FOR OTHERS WITH MORE COMPLEX HISTORIES. THIS CAN BE A MORE CHALLENGING AND LENGTHY PROCESS. FROM A LOGISTICAL STANDPOINT IN ORDER TO AGE TO ENSURE WE ARE AT HEARING TO BASS DRUM INFORMED PRACTICES. INDIVIDUAL SPACES DESIGNATED FOR RESIDENTS AND BRIDGE HOUSING THAT RESEMBLES SOMEWHAT OF A CUBICLE. THIS ALLOWS FOR A SENSE OF PRIVACY INVEST SAFETY BOTH ON THE PART OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE STAFF WITH SOME LEVEL OF VISIBILITY INTO THE SPACE WHICH HOUSES AN INDIVIDUAL BAD AND PRIVATE STORAGE AREA. THE GOAL OF BRIDGE HOUSING IS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH COMMUNITIES AND IT'S INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE SAFE AND WORKING TOWARDS THE GOAL OF PERMANENT HOUSING WELL RESIDENTS ARE IN BRIDGE HOUSING THEY'RE WORKING WITH THIS TEAM OF SKILLED PROFESSIONALS. WHO CAN SUPPORT THEM IN MEETING THESE GOALS IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY FEEL AT HOME? THE PEOPLE CONCERNS NEWEST BRIDGE HOUSING FACILITY IS CALLED A PLAN TODAY AND IT TEMPORARILY HOUSES FORTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HOMELESS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE UNION STATION IN DOWNTOWN LA. APPOINT A OPEN THIS PAST FALL INTO SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH I'M JUST UNDER 20%. SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH HOUSING I'M JUST UNDER 20% OF THE RESIDENTS SO FAR IN A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND PART OF WHAT IS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS HAS BEEN A COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL -- MERCHANTS AND VENDORS WHO -- WHO IS COMMON GOAL IS PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE -- THESE RESIDENTS FORM BONDS WITH THIS PROFESSIONAL SKILLED TEAM OF A SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO CAN ASSIST THEM IN INTEGRATING INTO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY -- WHILE ADDRESSING ANY BARRIERS THAT ARISE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

SEVEN ONE SEVEN GOOD MORNING MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB SEVEN ONE SEVEN CREATES A SAFER SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING STATE TAX AND FEE PAYMENTS FROM CASH BASED BUSINESSES. INCLUDING CANNABIS THIS BILL DIRECTS THE STATE TO CONTRACT WITH AN ARMORED CAR SERVICE PROVIDER TO SET UP AN OPT IN PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES WISHING TO HAVE THEIR TECH CASH TAX. AND FEE PAYMENTS PICKED UP COUNTED AND TRANSPORTED TO A BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THERE ABOUT ELEVEN STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA LEGAL IN TWENTY TWO STATES UNFORTUNATELY SINCE MARIJUANA IS STILL. ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE LARGELY UNABLE TO ACCESS BASIC BANKING SERVICES. THE INABILITY TO WRITE CHECKS MAKE AND RECEIVE ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS OR ACCEPT CREDIT CARD. OF OF DEATH AND DEBIT CARD CARDS MEANS THE INDUSTRY DEALS WITH LARGE SUMS OF CASH THE SECURITY RISK EXTENDS BEYOND THE INDUSTRY AFFECTING STATE AGENCIES. COLLECTING CASH TAX PAYMENTS AND ULTIMATELY. OUR COMMUNITIES GIVEN THE STATE LEVEL MOMENTUM ON THIS ISSUE WE HOPE IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES ACTION TO ENABLE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. ACCESS TO BANKING UNTIL THEN THIS BILL CREATES A STOPGAP METHOD FOR CURTAILING SOME OF THE SAFETY ISSUES. ASSOCIATED WITH PAYING TAXES USING MOUNTAINS OF CASH -- I'M JOINED BY HAYDEN TRIP PACK ON BEHALF OF GUARD -- WORLD AND TIM CROMARTIE ON BEHALF OF HDL WHO I DON'T KNOW IF TIM HAS MADE IT IN YET. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I HATE IN TRAFFIC GUARD WORLD WE ARE A LARGE ARMORED CAR CASH TRANSPORTATION COMPANY. ACROSS THE STATE -- AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TODAY WE WORK WITH. AGENCIES MUNICIPALITIES CITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ASSIST THEM IN THIS ISSUE -- THERE IS A SECURITY REST THAT'S IN PLACE TODAY -- BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS -- TAXPAYERS THAT THAT ARE AUTHORIZED REQUIRED -- TO LEGALLY PAY THEIR TAXES ARE HAVING TO LITTLE WE TAKE BAGS OF CASH INTO CITY HALL -- IT TO CERTAIN BUILDINGS ACROSS THE STATE -- WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM WHERE WE WOULD GO TO THE TAXPAYERS LOCATION? UP PICK UP THE CASH DEPOSIT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BRING IT BACK TO ONE OF OUR A SECURE PROCESSING CENTERS WHERE WE WOULD PROCESS OF DEPOSIT JUST LIKE. BANK OF AMERICA WELLS FARGO OR ANY OF THE LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WE WOULD PROCESS IT INTO THIS -- THE INSTITUTIONS -- FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS SO -- ON BEHALF OF THE AGENCY OR THE CITY THE STATE. THEY WOULD RECEIVE THE DEPOSIT. IN THEIR IN THEIR ACCOUNT WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO TOUCH THE CASH OR HANDLE IT IN ANY WAY. EVER HAVING TO SEE THE TAXPAYER REALLY THEY WOULD JUST RECEIVE THAT DEPOSIT INTO THEIR ACCOUNT -- TODAY WERE DOING THIS VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND LOOK TO EXPAND IT. THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE'RE RUNNING INTO IS THAT THE THERE'S NOT TO ANY AUTHORIZATION FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE OR HAVE THE TAXPAYER PAY FOR THE SERVICE. SO THIS WOULD REALLY ASSIST IN THAT PROCESS -- KEEPING EVERYONE SAFE AND SECURE AND MAKING IT A LOT MORE EFFICIENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANY FRANK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BELT BILL TO HELP KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES SAFE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY WITNESS SAYS AN OPPOSITION. SEE NINE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SINCE THE THIS. THE BANKS CANNOT ACCEPT OF MONEY CASH -- FROM CANNABIS -- WHEN WHEN IT WHEN WHEN THE ARMORED A? VEHICLESBRING THE CASH TO THE STATE WHERE WHERE WOULD THAT BE. IN A NOT. PHYSICALLY BUT WHAT AGENCIES WOULD ACCEPT THE MONEY WHERE WOULD THEY YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE DOING THE I TO THE AGENCIES NEVER REALLY GET THE CASH THEY JUST GET THE DEPOSIT INTO. OUT OF JUMPING ON BECAUSE GUARD IS A NATIONAL COMPANY AND HANDLES A WORK FOR MANY OTHER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES. HE MAY HAVE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE -- TO ABOUT THAT HE MAY HAVE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE ABOUT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN A BANK BUT IN THIS CASE IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD ONLY BE -- THE THE STATE AGENCIES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING. THE FUNDING NOW IF FOR THE STATE AGENCY WANTS THAT CASH TO ALSO BE DEPOSITED. INTO ITS ACCOUNT [inaudible] THEN. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE NEGOTIATED IN ADVANCE. WITH WITH THE COURIER SERVICE AND WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED -- BUT BUT BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF BANKING -- CHANCE AND THE THE MOST THE IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT I WAS FOCUSED ON THE BILL -- WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSPORTATION. HAVE HAPPENS IN A SAFE MANNER SO THAT THE CASH BEING TRANSPORTED FROM THE BUSINESS BECAUSE IN CERTAIN CASES -- THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE TWO THREE HOURS AWAY FROM WHERE THE BAD FORM WHERE THE STATE AGENCY IS THAT'S ACCEPTING THE CASH. THAT MAKES OF ALL THAT IS MY QUESTION THE STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE CASH WOULD JUST BE THE THE TAX BOARD FRANCHISE BOARD. DEPENDS WHO IT'S GOING. TO DEPENDS WHO IT'S GOING TO IT THERE WAS A I THINK THE BE -- WE HAD A SMALL PIECE AT SOME POINT -- BUT NOW THAT ROLE HAS GONE TO SEE THE TFA -- FRANCHISE TAX BOARD MIGHT HAVE A RULES SO. DEPENDS ON THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE RECEIVING IT. AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE CASH DIRECTLY TO THOSE AGENCY YEARS OR THAT KIND OF THE IN BETWEEN. TO EXPAND A LITTLE WELL SO SAID THE CAREER IS THE IN BETWEEN. BECAUSE WILL NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS OF OF CANNABIS BUSINESS BUT PROPRIETORS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING DUFFEL BAGS OF CASH. INTO A STATE OFFICE. WHICH MAKES THAT OFFICE VERY VULNERABLE. AND THE GOAL IS TO TAKE THAT VULNERABILITY AWAY BY. HAVING AN INTERMEDIARY. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PICK UP THE CASH PROCESS IT. AND THEN. EITHER MAKE THE ACTUAL DEPOSIT OR SAFELY GET THE CASH TO THE STATE AGENCY. IT IN IN A DISCREET MANNER SO THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE. IT DOESN'T. GET ATTENTION OBVIOUSLY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE AYE AYE IF MADAM CHAIR INDULGES SINCE THE WE WE HAVE A TEN JOINING US WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY A QUICK WORD WARRINGTON THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE MARTIN'S THANK YOU SO WHATEVER -- WE ARE SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I IN MY FORMAL AS A LOBBYIST FOR THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES WE HELPED CRAFT. THE TODAY'S REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN THE ONE MAJOR THING THAT IS MISSING. IS A SYSTEMATIC COMPONENT FOR HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE VAST VOLUMES OF CASH. THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES A LIKE A GOOD GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO THIS IS ADDRESSING A BADLY NEEDED -- PIECE OF THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE AND I CURRENTLY WORK. AS A CANNABIS CONSULTANT WITH A STEEL COMPANIES WE HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CITIES OF CLIENTS THE WHOLE STRUGGLE WITH THIS ISSUE. THERE NEEDS TO BE SYSTEMATIC MECHANISM OF FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE CASH THAT IS SAFE AND SECURE THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN -- WE'LL START WITH FILE ITEM AB. SIXTY THREE I THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS IS MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT AB SIXTY THREE A BILL THAT WILL ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT. AND RATE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH STATE AGENCIES THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PUBLIC MECHANISM TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON STATE AGENCIES. SOME AGENCIES HAVE A FEEDBACK FORM THAT ONLY THE STATE AGENCY CAN VIEW. THIS BILL CREATES A YELP LIKE PLATFORM FOR FOR CONSTITUENTS TO RATE THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES. AND PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE SERVICE THAT THEY RECEIVED. AFTER INTERACTION WITH THIS AGENCY CONSTITUENTS CAN PROVIDE FEEDBACK BY THE EXPERIENCE AND RATE HOW WELL THEY ARE SERVED ON A SCALE OF A TO F. -- APPLICATIONS LIKE YELP ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO RATE AND GIVE FEEDBACK ON A VARIETY OF SERVICES. AND THE TRANSPARENCY OF THESE PUBLIC POSTINGS AND RATINGS INCENTIVIZE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MORE RESPONSIVENESS TO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCES OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT BY DOING THIS CONSTITUENTS CONCEDE THAT THEY ARE BEING HEARD AND STATE AGENCIES CAN SEE AREAS THEY EXCEL IN. IN AREAS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. WE EXPECT SERVICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO IMPROVE THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES WE NEED A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC CAN KEEP KEEP THEM ACCOUNTABLE. CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT SHOULD STRIVE BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IMPROVING SERVICES AND PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE WITH TAX DOLLARS. I EXPECT THAT'S WHAT I ABOUT. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SINCE. ABOUT HIM HIS GAVEL TO YOU SEE YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. DO I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU THANK YOU. UGH WE LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. BURKE HI BURKE HI PATTERSON PATTERSON HI PETRIE-NORRIS PETRIE-NORRIS I LACKEY LACKEY AYE MEDINA MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. SMITH. SMITH ON THANK YOU SO I THAT BILL IS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OF AND TELL OUR MEMBERS TO ADD ON AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BOB YES. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO EIGHT NINE CREATES AN INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT A REFEREE IN THE FORM OF A BUT SPENT. DETERMINE IF A P. R. A REQUEST WAS WRONGFULLY DENIED. THE CURRENT PROCESS TO APPROVING OR DENYING A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST PROVIDES A LITTLE TO NO TRANSPARENCY. IN OUR CURRENT PROCESS STATE AGENCIES CAN DENY A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ACCESS PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST KNOWING THAT THERE IS NO APPEALS OPTION OTHER THAN TO TAKE THE AGENCY TO COURT. I AGENCIES HAVE AND CAN SIDE EXEMPTIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT HAVE NO RELATION TO THE RELATE REQUEST IN QUESTION AS A RIP BASIS FOR DENYING A REQUEST. WHEN A P. R. I REQUEST IS DENIED THE PUBLIC HAS NO RECOURSE OTHER THAN TO FILE AN EXPENSIVE LAWSUIT? WHICH IS OFTEN NOT FEASIBLE FOR ORDINARY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IN IT IS A TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH WAS THE INTENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WE NEED A STRUCTURE AND PROCESS TO PREVENT STATE AGENCIES FROM WORKING AROUND THE SYSTEM. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THESE EFFICIENCIES BY ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT REFEREE WHO AT THE REQUEST OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OR MEDIA OUTLET WHO SUBMITTED THE REQUEST CAN REVIEW THE DENIED PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND SERVE AS A OMBUDSMAN. AND AN ARBITER OR WHETHER THE STATE AGENCY HAS LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR DENYING THE REQUEST. THE ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN AT THE DMV. IN ORDER TO GET PUBLIC DOCUMENTS RELATED TO ITS OPERATIONS ONE MAJOR NEWS PUBLICATION HAD TO THREATEN A LAWSUIT. THIS IS NOT THE WAY THINGS SHOULD OPERATE WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT STRUCTURE THAT. THAT ENSURES THAT WE HAVE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY NUMBER OF NEWS OUTLETS INCLUDING THE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE HAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE BIXEL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE KERN COUNTY TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE PROUD OF CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE TAKEN A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL. THERE TO AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD MAKE THIS BILL MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS IT'S INTENDED TO HELP THE MOST. THAT WOULD BE TO EXPAND IT TO INCLUDE. A REQUEST THAT ARE DENIED BY LOCAL AGENCIES THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALLS I GET ON A DAILY BASIS ARE FROM. REQUESTED HAVE BEEN DENIED BY LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE SECOND WOULD BE THAT A VOLUME OF OPINIONS BY THIS OMBUDSMAN OR PUT OUT. THAT -- BOTH AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS CAN THEN USE IN THE FUTURE TO HOPEFULLY. DECREASE THE NUMBER OF DISPUTES WE HAVE SO WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THE BILL. VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT WE THINK THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS WOULD REALLY MAKE IT A VERY STRONG BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITNESSES AN OPPOSITION.
