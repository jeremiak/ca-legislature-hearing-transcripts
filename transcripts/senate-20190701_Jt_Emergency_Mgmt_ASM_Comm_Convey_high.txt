BRIEFLY -- MISTER SANTIAGO HAVE OPENING REMARKS -- YES THANKS MANAGER I'M EAGER TO GET TO THIS SO I KEEP MY REMARKS -- VERY GOOD -- BRIEF BUT NONE THE LESS WE HAD A COMMITTEE HEARING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE BUT A YEAR AGO OR SO. AND THIS WILL HELP US TO PREPARE -- I'M A TO GET AN UPDATE TO BE PREPARED -- FOR THE NEXT MERGING SHE SHOULD HAPPEN AND WE KNOW THAT IT ALWAYS DOES NOT A QUESTION OF THE QUESTION IS IF IT HAPPENS TO QUESTION ONE IT HAPPENS AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER GIVES UP TO THE THIRD TO LEARN -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT ISSUES AND WE CONSIDER THEM -- AS WILL TAKE A LOOK AT SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE SO I APPRECIATE YOU -- REACHING OUT AND PUT THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. I'M JUST BE VERY CONCISE ABOUT THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS HEARING. IS TO LOOK FOR HOW WE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM OVERALL FOR EVERY COMMUNITY THIS PAST WEEKEND I HOSTED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. TOWN HALL IN SIMI VALLEY MY OWN COMMUNITY -- IS WELL SUPPORTED BY VENTURA COUNTY FIRE WE HAD ABOUT SEVENTY RESIDENTS COME OUT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE RESIDENT WHO HAD YET OPTED IN TO V. C. ALERTS. UNFORTUNATELY SO WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS ONE CHALLENGE MANY OF THE RESIDENTS DID NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY WERE FOLLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THEIR UPDATES THEY NEED TO BE FOLLOWING. THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF THE VENTURA COUNTY FIRE AND SO WE WE SHARE THAT INFORMATION WE ALSO SHARED -- INFORMATION ABOUT NICK SOUL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE AN A. M. RADIO AM FM RADIO IN YOUR HOME WITH BATTERIES OR WITH SOME KIND OF SOLAR CAPACITY. BUT WHAT WE KNOW WE NEED IN THIS SYSTEM IS GOD PROTOCOLS THAT WORK FOR THE FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND WHO THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE TO WORKING WITH. THAT WE NEED REDUNDANCY WE NEED STRUCTURAL REDUNDANCY AND THAT MEANS WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS -- AS WELL AS A FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF EMERGENCY. PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE THAT KEEP PEOPLE SAFE SO WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AT THE TABLE WITH US TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR STATE LEGISLATORS IS HOW WHERE AND HOW CAN WE FILL IN THE GAPS HOW DO WE MAKE THIS SYSTEM. HOLE HOW DO WE MAKE IT FUNCTION HOW DO WE MAKE IT IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIVE I'M IN A WAY THAT HELPS US SAVE LIVES SO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TODAY AND TO GET EVERYONE HOME FOR DINNER PLEASE I KNOW WE HAD ORIGINALLY SAID YOU KNOW REMARKS OF ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MINUTES. IF YOU COULD CONSIDER MAYBE GOING FROM ABOUT ME TO MAYBE FIVE TO EIGHT MINUTES -- PERCENT OF TESTIMONY THINK THAT'LL HELP US ALL MOVE ALONG TODAY SO WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED THEN WITH OUR FIRST GROUP. AND THAT IS PROVIDING THE STATE PERSPECTIVES SO WE HAVE MARKET A DUTY DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. MICHAEL PICKER PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA P. UC AND CHIEF THOMAS PORTER DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. A GENTLEMAN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY I COULD AFTERNOON -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUE OF A LEARN MORNING AND OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW IT RELATES TO EMERGENCY SERVICES -- OXY MCCARTY SHE THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. I I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LAST. COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN UNPRECEDENTED IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF WILDFIRES -- WE'VE SEEN OVER THREE MILLION ACRES BURNED AND THAT COSTED ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WILDFIRES HOUSTON SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN EIGHT OF WHICH RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC -- DISASTERS AND IMPACT OF THE COMMUNITY AND YOU KNOW I THINK FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE ACTUALLY TWELVE THIRTEEN WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A VARIETY OF DISASTERS IN THE STATE EVERYTHING FROM. FROM NOT JUST FIRED BUT EARTHQUAKE FLOODS ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS STATUS BUT WE COLLAPSE IN IN -- CHICO AND ORVILLE -- WE SAW -- THE REFUGIO OIL SPILL WE SAW THAT KELLY SO GAS LEAK AND WE HAD A TEARS ATTACK IN. SAN BERNADINO WE'VE HAD. ALL OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS PREPARE FOR AND YOU KNOW CLEARLY OUT BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN WE LOST CLOSE. TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED. AND OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY FATALITIES. AND CLEARLY WELL OVER TWELVE BILLION INSURED LOSSES. I THINK THAT AFTER SEVENTEEN REALLY THE FOCUS -- WAS ON ALERT AND WARNING AND BEING ABLE TO UP UPGRADE THAT. SYSTEM AND AND AT THAT TIME -- YES MOVE TO REVISE AND ADVANCE A MORE CONSISTENT STANDARDIZED ALERT AND WARNING GUIDELINE. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT VIRTUALLY ALL DISASTERS ARE. A MERGER ON A LOCAL LEVEL AND AND THAT'S WHERE OUR PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING EFFORTS NEEDED TO FOCUS. PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON BEST PRACTICES IN PROTOCOLS IN TRAINING AS WELL AS ACCESS THE UTILIZATION OF KEY COMMUNICATION TOOLS SUCH AS THE FEDERAL INTEGRATED PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM OR I PAUSE -- WE CONVENE A STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ALERT WARNING SPECIALIST COMMITTEE WHICH WAS MADE UP OF LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES TO CREATE UPDATED ALERT WARNING GUIDELINES -- THIS WAS ACTUALLY REQUIRED BY SENATE BILL -- EIGHT THREE THREE THEY CAME IN IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE GUIDELINES WERE DISTRIBUTED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STANDARDIZED. STANDARDIZING THE APPROACH AS WELL AS THE USE OF SIMPLE METHODS THAT MUST ENSURE COMPREHENSIVE ALERT AND WARNING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COUNTIES ARE NOW. BEGINNING TO USE THOSE GUIDELINES AND ENHANCE THEIR STANDARDIZED ALERTING. PROTOCOLS ACROSS THE ACROSS ALL OF THEIR SYSTEMS ON CLEARLY PART OF THAT IS THE OPTED OUT OPT OUT SYSTEM MANY -- INDIVIDUALS BELIEVE THAT THEY STILL NEED TO OPT IN AND IT WAS ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION BY SENATOR JACKSON THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE. BUT NOW SAYS THAT -- YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY OPT OUT COMMUNITIES COUNTIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL CAN USE -- UP PUBLIC PAID OUT FROM UTILITIES AND EXCEPT FOR A TO BE ABLE -- TO GET INFORMATION AND PUT. INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY INTO AN ALERT MORGAN NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. ONE OTHER AREA THAT WE WORKED ON ADDRESSING AND LEARNED WARNING WAS THE ISSUE EVACUATION. AND THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED TERMINOLOGY. WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE CALIFORNIANS ARE UNCLEAR ON THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE ACTIONS TO TAKE WHEN EVACUATION ORDERS WERE ISSUED BECAUSE DIFFERENT PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WERE USING. DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY -- WE CONVENE AN EVACUATION TERMINOLOGY WORKING GROUP -- COMPRISE AGAIN OF OF OF ALL THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND ENTITIES EMERGENCY SERVICES FROM EVERY REGION IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THE GROUP UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED A SERIES OF STANDARDIZED TERMS. STANDARDIZED TERMS FOR THE USE BY PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THOSE ORIENTED AROUND EVACUATION ORDERS EVACUATION WARNINGS AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS AND THOSE ARE NOW BEING CONVEYED AND LAID OUT THROUGHOUT THE THE STATE. BOB WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE LORTON WAY TECHNOLOGIES NOW THROUGH THE PREPARATION OF OUR NEXT GENERATION. NINE ONE ONE THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS WILL BE THAT NEXT GENERATION SYSTEM WILL BE IP BASED. LAW AND WILL BE CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING DATA SOURCES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND WILL INCLUDE A COMMON STATEWIDE LEARN MORNING PLATFORM. THAT WILL PROVIDE THE ABILITY FOR EVERY LOCAL AGENCY TO RECEIVE GENERATE AND VIEW ALERTS AND WARNINGS. THE NEXT GENERATION SYSTEM WILL INCLUDE REDUNDANT CONNECTIONS TO EVERY PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT OR P. SAP USING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY MICROWAVE NETWORK TO ENSURE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE EVENT. THAT A BACK HALL OR THE FIBER LINE IS DESTROYED. KELLY ALSO IS ALSO WORKING WITH EACH OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS TO PROVIDE A COMMON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM. TO DELIVER CONSISTENT MAPPING INFORMATION. ANOTHER CAPABILITY INCLUDED IN THE NEXT GEN INCLUDES THE INTERFACE TO COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH. SYSTEMS USING THE PEACE SAP TO DISPATCH RESOURCES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING DATA FROM NEIGHBORING AGENCIES AS WELL AS AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. SUCH TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP ENSURE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THE SITUATION AWARENESS THEY NEED TO DISPATCH THE CLOSEST RESOURCE. DURING EMERGENCIES. IT'S CLEAR THAT AFFECTED EMERGENCY MEASURE REQUIRES THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THIS DATA IN REAL TIME FROM ALL AVAILABLE SOURCES TO ENSURE THE DECISION MAKERS HAVE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES. BOB ALONG THE ROUTE -- THERE'S BEEN MUCH EFFORT MADE TO ENSURE FOR CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION AND USE OF THE ALERT WARNING SYSTEM. AND WORK BY STATE LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS AGENCIES TO PREPARE FOR NEW NORMS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE NOW USED TO PUSH OUT A LURCH TO THE PUBLIC AND TO OUR RESPONDENTS VIA THEIR MOBILE PHONES TABLETS. TELEVISIONS EXCEPT FOR A ARE PREDOMINATELY OWN AND MANAGE BY THE PRIVATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR. AND ARE FULLY DEPENDENT ON A ROBUST AND RESILIENT SECULAR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND A SUSTAINABLE POWER. EMERGENCY ALERTS FACE CRITICAL LIMITATIONS WHEN POWER IS LOST OR IN THE CASE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW WITH OUR EVEN IF -- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES PRETTY BOB BOB. PRE OP PROACTIVELY SHUTTING POWER OFF IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL FIRE SITUATIONS. OR WHEN A CELL SITE GOES DOWN. INCLUDING THE THEIR BACK CALL FOR THAT SELL SIDE BOB WHICH INCLUDES THE FIBER LINES. EITHER DUE TO LOSS OF POWER OR FROM BEING DESTROYED BY FIRE EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER DISASTERS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CELL SITE ITSELF AND THE BACK FULL -- FIBER CABLE -- THAT SUPPORTS THAT ENTITY THE LOSS OF THE CELL SITES PREVENTION ALERTS FROM GOING OUT TO THE PUBLIC EFFECTIVELY RECEIVING RECEIVING THEM DURING NUMBER JUST YOUR DISASTER. THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN ALERT WARNINGS EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS INITIATIVE RESPONSE IS NOW A RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. IN THE MIDST OF THESE DISASTERS RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE LIFELINE FOR EVERY PERSON OUR MOBILE PHONES HAVE BECOME AN INDISPENSABLE PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY. TODAY WE KNOW THAT OVER 80% OF ALL NINE ONE ONE CALLS ARE FROM A CELLULAR DEVICE WE ALSO KNOW THAT OVER 50% OF ALL HOMES IN THE U. S. USE ONLY A CELLULAR DEVICE FOR COMMUNICATIONS. WE KNOW THAT CITED COMMUNICATIONS CAN BE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE REALITY IS THAT SENATOR DEVICES ARE NOW THESE CRITICAL LIFELINES YET. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TIME AND TIME AGAIN NATURAL AND HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS HAVE PUSHED THE SYSTEM. BEYOND WHAT. IT WAS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT. WE NOW WE KNOW THAT -- WHEN PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE SITE OR NETWORK THEY CAN CALL NAY ONE THEY CAN RECEIVE ALERT MORNINGS THEY CAN ACCESS INFORMATION RELATED TO ONGOING DISASTERS? AND WE HAVE SEEN SUCCESS STORIES DEMONSTRATING THAT WHEN THE SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE IT CAN BE A POWERFUL LIFESAVING TOOL. THE PROBLEM IS THAT. WE'VE ALSO DEMONSTRATED ACCOUNTS THAT POINT TO INCONSISTENCIES IN THE SECULAR. SYSTEM. MANY TIMES DURING THE DISASTROUS OTHER SYSTEM SIMPLY DOES NOT SUPPORT THE NEEDS -- OF THE PUBLIC OR PUBLIC SAFETY. I WANT TO STRESS THAT I'M NOT HERE TO SLAM TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER THEY ARE PARTNERS BUT THE IDENTIFIED GAPS THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. I'VE TESTIFIED NUMEROUS TIMES AND PROVIDED THE STATISTICS OF NUMBERS OF CELL SITES THAT WENT OFFLINE DURING RECENT DISASTERS. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED OUTAGES THAT HAVE AFFECTED ENTIRE COUNTIES SUCH AS A COMMUNICATION OUTAGE MONA COUNTY. THAT OCCURRED ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD OF THIS YEAR WHEN THE ENTIRE COUNTY WAS WITHOUT ANY COMMUNICATIONS LANDLINE CELLULAR OR NINE ONE ONE FOR OVER TWENTY EIGHT HOURS DUE TO A FIBRE OPTIC. BREAK AND THE LACK OF REDUNDANCY. THE FCC HAS PUBLISHED A TWO STICKS ON SECULAR OUTAGES DURING HURRICANES. THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE SUSTAINABILITY OVERSIGHT OF SYSTEM IS INCONSISTENT. AND DOES NOT MEET THE NEED. WHEN I REPORT THAT THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE CELL SITES WHAT WENT OFFLINE DURING THE? NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OCTOBER WILDFIRES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE CELL SITES WENT OFF LINE DURING THE CAMPFIRE AND WILL SEE FIRES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WERE IN IF THAT IF YOU WERE IN THESE IMPACT AREAS YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO CALL RECEIVE AN ALERT. AND IN MANY CASES YOU COULD NOT USE YOUR CELL DEVICE TO ASSIST YOU WITH THE TERM IN THE SAFEST EVACUATION ROUTE. WHEN WE REVIEW THE FCC OUTAGE DATA FROM HURRICANE FLORENCE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THREE DAYS AFTER THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL? THEY WERE COUNTIES WHERE OVER LINE. DURING HURRICANE MICHAEL. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE COUNTIES WHERE OVER 75% OF THE CELL SITES WERE OFFLINE DAYS AFTER THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL. PC SIX SIX STATISTICS CALL INTO QUESTION THE WRITTEN RELIABILITY OF OUR NATION'S PRIVATELY ONLY MANAGE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM -- AN ERROR WE BELIEVE IT HOLDS TRUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. WHERE WE CAN POINT TO SUCCESS STORIES THAT THE CYSTIC STATISTICS SHOW? THAT THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE OUT AND TO BE FAIR THERE'S BEEN SOME HARDENING. IN UPGRADES. OF THE SYSTEM IN IN CERTAIN PLACES IN THE STATE AND THIS OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE WORKED HARD TO ENHANCE THEIR PORTABLE GENERATOR SOLUTIONS AND DEPLORABLE SOLUTIONS LIKE CELLS ON LIGHT TRUCKS ARE COLDS. SELLS ON WHEELS WERE EVEN MORE RECENTLY CELLS ON WINGS OR FLYING CALLUSES THERE FOR ACTUALLY CALLED. WHILE THESE ARE PORTABLE AND DEPLORABLE SOLUTIONS PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY AND THE TRAP AND TEMPORARY SOLUTION FOR WHEN CELL SITES GO DOWN DURING A DISASTER. THEY ARE SIMPLY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR SOUTHERN NETWORK THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE MORE RESILIENT FROM THE DISASTER IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY THAT A PORTABLE SOLUTION COULD SUPPORT THE NEED WHEN OVER 50% OF SET ASIDES IN A COUNTY GO DOWN I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY FOCUS. ON SITE IMPACTFUL HALL HARDENING AND REDUNDANCY INDEED THE ENTIRE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT -- AT THE PATH FORWARD. PLEASE INCLUDE ADEQUATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AT SAILOR SITES. HARDENING OF EACH SO YOUR SITE. TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL TO WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKES STORM AND OTHER DISASTER. INCREASE BATTERY BACKUP CAPABILITY. ESTABLISH A GENERATOR BACKUP IN EVERY SITE THAT CAN SUPPORT. AN INSURER FOR REDUNDANT BACK CALL CONNECTIONS THAT ELIMINATE THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE THAT EXIST IN THE CELLULAR NETWORK TODAY. AS WE FACE THE NEW NORMAN CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY BY PARTNERING WITH OUR TELECOMMUNICATION PARTNERS. TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO ENSURE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY GREAT CONSISTENCY IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- AND ULTIMATELY THIS WILL SAVE LIVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AFTERNOON MICHAEL PICKER I WORK AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I'M GONNA ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE CLICK ON THESE ISSUES IS THE UNDERLYING RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY OF THE CORE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TO THE THIS IS SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS -- I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS IS THIS INDUSTRY WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE P. YOU SEE I I REALIZED THAT WE HAD VERY LITTLE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THAT WHERE THERE WAS IT WAS A PATCHWORK FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY OR IFFERENT KINDS OF SERVICES OVER TIME. SO I I WELL I WENT TO TO A MEETING OF THE CALIFORNIA -- TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I ASKED HIM WHY ARE YOU GUYS EVEN AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION YOUR COMPETITIVE WHY IF THERE'S A MARKET FOR SERVICES AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR CHOICE WHY WOULD BE YOU CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT. CAN I GOT TWO ANSWERS THERE WERE SOMEWHAT INSTRUCTIVE SO THE FIRST IS THAT BECAUSE THEY HVE A LICENSE TO OPERATE AS A UTILITY EVEN WITHOUT MUCH AUTHORITY AND REGULATION BEHIND IT. THERE THEN ENTITLED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY OF THE NETWORK OF WOODEN POLES THAT ARE ACTED BY THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A WAY TO REACH CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S AN FCC ROLE. THE SECOND REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE FOR ME WAS THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDER THE THE UMBRELLA OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THERE'S ONE MARKET STATE WIDE THAT AND ONE SET OF MARK A RULES AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF LOCAL REGULATION WHICH ALLOWS FOR FREEDOM OF INVESTMENT ACROSS THE STATE. AND TO SOME EXTENT ALL THESE THINGS WERE DESIGNED TO HELP BRING FORWARD BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS NOT JUST THE OLD COPPER WIRE TELEPHONE SERVICE. BUT PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT DATA SERVICE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ENABLED BY FIBER ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES. AND SO THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO SOME EXTENT AND I DON'T QUITE A QUESTION AT ALL. THE THE CHALLENGE THAT I'VE SEEN EMERGING HOWEVER IS THAT -- AS YOU START TO SEE THIS MOVEMENT AWAY FROM A REGULATED ENTITY PEOPLE ARE COMPETING FOR CUSTOMERS AND THEY'RE COMPETING FOR THE BEST CUSTOMERS THEY WANT DENSITY OF CUSTOMER SO THAT YOUR INVESTMENT REACHES THE MOST PEOPLE. WHO WILL THEN BY SERVICES AND TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THAT COST OF THAT -- THOSE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO LIVE IN SPARSER AREAS OR P. PORTIONS OF COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DON'T BUY THOSE HIGH AND SERVICES LOTS OF BAND WITH. TEND NOT TO GET THE SAME KIND OF SERVICES IN HIS AND GIVE SOME EXPLANATION ON THAT. THE FIRST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT EQUAL. FROM PLACE TO PLACE -- OVER A THIRD OF THE STATE THIRTY FIVE PER SENT TO THE STATE ONLY HAS ONE PROVIDER OR NO PROVIDER FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO BROADBAND PROVIDERS. WE GIVE AWAY GRANTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND TO BE ABLE TO HELP ALLOW THOSE COMMUNITIES TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO WILL PROVIDE THE BROADBAND AND THEN THEY CAN GET DIFFERENT SERVICES OVER THAT BAR. THAT BACKBONE PROVIDER. THAT WAS PART OF OUR OUR COMPETITION ANALYSIS TOOL WE DO WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS ACTUALLY COMPETITION AND THEN WE LOOK TO SEE HOW THE SERVICE QUALITY IS BEING PROVIDED. SO WE DID A NETWORK EXAM THAT THE RESULTS ARE FINALLY UP BUT I CAN POINT TO SOME OF THE THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THAT PERIOD FROM SEVENTEEN SO ONLY ABOUT 7% OF CALIFORNIANS REALLY USE THE OLD A PLAIN OLD OF PHONE SERVICE -- ITS DECLINE PRETTY STEADILY -- BUT BOTH [inaudible] VERIZON. FRONTIER IN EIGHTEEN T. HAVE HAD A HIGHER RATE OF REPORTED CUSTOMER OUTAGES AND LONGER TIME PERIODS. TO RESTORE SERVICES TO THOSE THOSE LIVE REMAINING LANDLINE CUSTOMERS. THESE TWO CARRIERS DID NOT MAINTAIN THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITHSTAND. JUST SIMPLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS -- CUSTOMER ADAGES INCREASE. WHEN IT'S RAINING AND SNOWING? MOST CENTRAL OFFICES DON'T HAVE REDUNDANCY OR BACKUP POWER DURING EQUIPMENT FAILURES. EIGHTEEN T. AND VERIZON FRONTIER IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN OF FOCUSED ON THOSE REALLY DENSELY POPULATED URBAN SUBURBAN AREAS WITH CUSTOMERS DO HAVE. DIFFERENT CHOICES WHEN THEY DON'T GET THE QUALITY OF SERVICE. SO MANY THE THESE RURAL AREAS AND SOME SUBURBAN AREAS ARE IN THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE THAT IS SEEN FIRES BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE IN AREAS WHERE THAT ARE PRONE TO FLOODING AND OTHER KINDS OF CONTACT CATASTROPHIC ISSUES. I GOT TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR PUBLIC SAFETY EVEN ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. SO -- SPEAKING TO THE LOSS OF A FIBER CABLE IN LAS COMMUNICATIONS NINE ONE ONE A PUBLIC SAFETY PROVIDERS IN LARGE PARTS OF MENDOCINO HUMBLE CINNAMON LAKE COUNTIES ARE CENTER MIKE WEIR SAID. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OR RISK WHEN A SIMPLE FIBER CUT CAN LEAD TO RURAL RESIDENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO ACTION AN AMBULANCE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A STANDS NOW HE SAYS. TELECOM COMPANIES DON'T LET EMERGENCIES OFFICIALS KNOW WHEN THE LOCAL NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS NOT OPERATING WHICH PUTS THEM. AND THEIR THEIR THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN DANGER. SO AGAIN SOME. RURAL AREAS DON'T HAVE THAT CELL SERVICE THEY CAN COMPETE WITH A PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE SERVICE THAT I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS BEING -- IN DECLINE -- I WON'T GO INTO THE SPECIFICS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. BUT WE DID DO A WORKSHOP THAT REALLY REITERATED A LOT OF THE THE THE DATE OF THAT -- THAT -- THIS -- DIRECTOR -- KILLER DUTY HAS POINTED OUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'D HEARD ABOUT THE MASSIVE LOSS OF THE SELF SITES. SO I STARTED LOOKING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WAR AND IT DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS OR LEADING UP TO AND I THE THE CINEMA COUNTY. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY. MANAGEMENT TO THIS AFTER STUDY CALLED THE CINEMA COUNTY OPERATIONAL AREA LURKING MORNING FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE AFTER ACTION REPORT. WHICH IS HOW THEY TALK -- IT IN PART OF THE EFFORT TO COUNTY STAFF ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE DAY AGING KEEP SEEKS ON EMERGENCY WARNING LIST. THAT IS PURCHASED AND THEN IT'S UP TO TWICE YEAR FROM EIGHTEEN T. IN FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS BUT THEY CAN ONLY REACH 51% OF THOSE PEOPLE SUCCESSFULLY TO EITHER TALK TO SOMEBODY OR TO LEAVE A MESSAGE. IN IN A SUBSEQUENT PHASE OF THEIR TEST THE COUNTY OFFICIALS TARGETED FIVE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS FOR TEST OF THEIR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS TO WIRELESS CUSTOMERS. AND THEY FOUND INCONSISTENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN HOW PROVIDERS ALERT CUSTOMERS. THAT MAKES THE TASK VERY HARD IF SOMEBODY FOLLOWS BASICALLY A LINE DRAWING OF A GEOGRAPHIC AREA. AND PULLS OUT PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS WHO MAY HAVE A BILLING ADDRESS FOR ANOTHER PROVIDER ACTUALLY HAS A POLY GONE AROUND A CELL TOWER THAT THE USED TO CON A MAP OUT HOW YOU NOTIFY. THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY THEN FOR THE AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO NOTIFY IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. FOR EVACUATION AND I THINK DIRECTOR BILL OR DO YOU JUST TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE NEED FOR BACKUP POWER FOR THE SELL SIDE SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT -- THE FOR US IT'S AS GOOD AS CITY GREAT CHALLENGE TO SEE HOW THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO OPERATE THE WAY THAT WE EXPECTED. AND THE WAY THE CONSUMERS RELY ON IT BUT KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME THAT THERE'S ALL THIS WEAKNESS IS BOTH IN TERMS OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE DESIGN OF THE WAY THAT THE UTILITIES. AND WORK TOGETHER [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHIEF. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S TOM PORTER I'M DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE -- AND I WANT -- TO THEY COVER FOR YOU KIND OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FROM THE RESPONSE SIDE -- OF THIS THIS ISSUE -- WELL CAL FIRE A IS NOT ONE THAT SEND AN AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT THE SENDS OUT ALERTS AND WARNINGS -- WE DO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AS AS DO OTHERS AND I'LL MENTION SOME OF THOSE. IN THE ASSISTANCE IN IN DEVELOPING THE INFORMATION THAT THAT TURNS INTO AN ALERT OR WARNING -- FOR INSTANCE -- WE ARE UTILIZING -- WEATHER INFORMATION MAPS FUELS DATA SEASONALITY -- AND DIFFERENT -- PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE THROUGH OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES -- TO REALLY PUT SOME FIDELITY TO WHAT -- WEATHER EVENT IS GOING TO DO AND HOW THAT LOOKS RELATED TO FIRE STARTS FOR INSTANCE. SO -- FOCUSING IN ON THE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO -- AND I WILL KEEP MY MY COMMENTS -- CONCISE -- BEFORE A FIRE AT A WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT THOSE THOSE WHETHER -- A BALANCE -- THAT MAY BE RELATED TO LARGE FIRE AT LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRE GROWTH -- SO WE WORK WITH -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WHICH IS THE SERVICE THAT WOULD PUT OUT -- AND A EITHER WARNING OR NOW WATCH FOR A WEATHER EVENT -- AND WE WORK WITH THEM RELATED TO THE FUELS CONDITIONS AS I MENTIONED -- AND NOT JUST THOSE THOSE WINDOW VENTS THAT HAPPEN FOR INSTANCE IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN THE HUMIDITY IS WAY UP WE MAY HAVE. A HIGH WINDS BUT NOT A FIRE WEATHER WATCH OR WARNING BECAUSE OF THE HUMIDITY -- WE WERE WE HAVE -- IT NINETY TO REMOTELY -- OPERATE OUR REMOTE AUTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS ROZ'S THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL AND THOSE OR SATELLITE -- PAINTING -- OF WEATHER DATA SOURCES THAT THAT ALL. OF THE DIFFERENT -- A AGENCIES CAN USE -- AND THEN AS MENTIONED WE USE SATELLITE IMAGERY -- AND MANY OTHER -- MODELS TO DETERMINE WHAT WHAT KIND OF FOR AFFECTS FIRE MIGHT HAVE ON THE LANDSCAPE. WE DO THIS THROUGH OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM I BELIEVE I HAVE. SUPPLIED YOU WITH A HAND OUT OF THAT SO I WILL TALK SPECIFICALLY IN DEPTH ABOUT WHAT THAT PROGRAM DOES PLEASE DO -- ROOT REFERENCE THAT THAT DOCUMENT -- BUT THEY THERE ARE TWO OF THEM THERE WERE -- ONES IN RIVERSIDE ONES IN -- READING. AND THEY COVER THE ENTIRE STATE SPLIT IN ROUGHLY ROUGHLY IN HALF. AND THOSE YOU'LL HEAR OFTEN US TALK ABOUT THE GAC OR GEOGRAPHIC. AREA COORDINATION CENTERS -- WORK THE NORTH OP SOUTH OPS THOSE ARE INTERCHANGEABLE AND THOSE ARE WHERE OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES FOLKS WORK -- THE IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT FIRE POTENTIAL AND THEY THEY PUT OUT OF PRODUCTS ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT OUR WEB BASED. AND AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC AND FOR DECISION MAKERS TO ACCESS AND THOSE ARE. THINGS LIKE A TWO DAY OUTLOOK WHICH GIVES YOU TODAY AND TOMORROW WHAT THAT WHAT THE PREDICTED WEATHER IS AND WHAT THE LIKELIHOOD FOR LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRE GROWTH WOULD BE. AN INITIAL ATTACK ACTIVITY THE SEVEN DAY -- PRODUCT WHICH REALLY LOOKS AT ALL ALL OF THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- POTENTIAL. FOR LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRE -- BEHAVIOR THE SANTANA WILDFIRE THREAT INDEX WHICHWE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IN RECENT YEARS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REALLY PUTS FIDELITY TO WEAR WINDS ARE GOING TO BE THE WORST AND AT WHAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF OF LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRES IS FROM FROM A SANTA ANA THAT. AND THEN THE MONTHLY AND SEASONAL OUTLOOKS WE'VE WE'VE WE GET FROM THEM KIND OF WHAT THINGS ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE THROUGHOUT THE THE YEAR. ALL THE MONTH IN THE YEAR ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF THE ALERTS AND WARNINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RELATED TO WEATHER EVENTS. SO -- WHAT CAL FIRE ALSO DOES IS ONCE ONCE THESE? ALERTS ARE ARE -- PUT OUT WE UTILIZE OUR ARE YOU EDUCATION PLATFORM AND OUR MEDIA IS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO REALLY AMPLIFY WHATEVER IS COMING OUT SO WHATEVER TYPE OF OF ALERT MORNING -- MUCH LIKE A LOCAL FIRE AND YES DOES AS WELL WE ARE AMPLIFYING THOSE FIRE WEATHER WATCHES RED FLAG WARNINGS -- ALSO OTHER TYPES OF OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS AND ALERTS THAT HAPPENED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WELL -- WELL A FIRE IS GOING LET'S JUST LET'S JUST LEAVE IT WITH FIRE -- ITS CLOSEST TO MY HEART -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR WHAT'S HAPPENING -- WITH THAT WITH THE FIRE WEATHER THAT THAT IS -- IS JUST AFFECTING THE THE SPREAD OF OF WILDFIRE -- ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND THEN FURTHER MAKE PREDICTIONS ON ONE WILL AREAS THAT WE WILL LIKELY NEED TO DO EVACUATIONS AND THEN WE WERE WE WILL ENTER INTO -- UNIFIED COMMAND WITH THE LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHOEVER THAT IS THEY WILL PUT OUT THE THE ALERTS AND WARNINGS AND HAND THE EVACUATION ORDERS -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE WITH THEM AND THEN WE REVERSE ENGINEER THAT FOR RE POPULATION -- ONCE ONCE -- THOSE EVENTS ARE DONE -- MOVING INTO THE AFTER -- AFTER WILD FIRE AFTER EVENT OF WE OFTEN WILL WORK THROUGH OUR OUR A WILDFIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS AND ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THE BEAR TEAMS BURNED AREA EMERGENCY RESPONSE. TO PUT SENSORS OUT INTO CREEKS ON MOUNTAIN SIDES -- TO WATCH -- FLOWS PEAK FLOWS THAT ARE COMING INTO CREEKS AND DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH WILL THEN ALSO THROUGH SATELLITE TELEMETRY OR RADIO TELEMETRY -- ALERT OF THINGS LIKE -- FLOODS AND THAT HAPPENED -- ABOVE. AMONG THE CEO -- AND WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE WENT INTO PLACE -- TO PROTECT -- RESIDENTS FROM THE THE FLOODS THAT HAPPEN AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT DIDN'T. PROTECT EVERY RESIDENTS BUT WE DID. HAVE THOSE THOSE IN PLACE AND WERE ABLE. TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE IT TRULY WAS A THREAT AND IT WAS -- COMING THAT EVENING. AND THEN FINALLY -- WE UTILIZE ALL OF OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- TOOLS THROUGH OUR OUR READY FOR WILDFIRE APP -- AND ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ANY PUBLIC MEMBERS THROUGH THAT APP OR THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. THANK YOU AND I'M OPEN FOR QUESTIONS SIMON THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. I THANK AHEAD. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A QUOTE THE A COUPLE QUESTIONS CAN IN THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY MAYBE -- MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE THE OBSTACLES IF YOU HAD THE LAN RIGHT AMOUNT AND NUTS AND BOLTS. NOT AT A HIGH LEVEL. A TO COMMUNICATING INTERNET EMERGENCY. I THINK ULTIMATELY. ITS ITS RELIABILITY -- OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM. YOU KNOW -- OF WHEN A WHEN A SHELL SAY GOES DOWN -- WHEN A FIBRE LINE GETS BURNED OR BROKEN -- BUT WE WE LOOK WE LOSE THAT THAT SITE WE OR WE LOSE MULTIPLE SITES. AND AND THE REALITY IS IS THAT -- SAYS EVERYBODY'S DEPENDING UPON THIS SYSTEM. WE'VE PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN THAT BASKET -- WE IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE VERY LITTLE. CONTROL OVER BUT WE'RE DEPENDING UPON IT. MORE MORE. FOR ALL KINDS OF VACATIONS THAT WE STILL HAVE OUR LAND MOBILE RADIOS. BUT THOSE -- COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC WHAT COMMUNICATES TO THE PUBLIC. IS THE SIDE OR NETWORK. AND SO WHAT WHAT WE NEED IS RELIABILITY. AND THAT MEANS WE NEED TO HAVE. THE FIBRIL LINES IN THE CABLE. RAP AND MADE RESILIENT SO IT CAN WITHSTAND -- DIFFERENT KINDS OF IMPACTS WE NEED A CELL SITE THAT'S GOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND IT. AND IT'S HARD AND TO THE TO THE DEGREE THAT IT'S PROTECTED. FROM CERTAIN KINDS OF DISASTERS WE DO HAVE BATTERY BACKUP OR GENERATOR BACKUP SO THAT WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF. IN A DISK IN A DISASTER OR IT'S PREEMPTIVELY SHUT OFF BY THE UTILITY. THAT THAT THE THOSE COMMUNICATION SITES REMAIN IN PLACE THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY -- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE WE WE NEED TO HAVE BECAUSE BECAUSE EVEN AS WE MOVE TO WHAT'S CALLED FIRST AT WHICH IS A BROADBAND IN. A PUBLIC SAFETY INTEROPERABLE. THE DATA SYSTEM. THAT'S USING THE SAME AND THAT IN THE ADDRESS IS THE SAME EXACT SYSTEM. AS PUBLIC SAFETY MOVED TO THAT MOVING DATA AND OTHER CRITICAL INFORMATION -- IF THOSE SITES ARE DOWN -- WE WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE. SO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT REDUNDANCY AND I ASKED AS IN OUR PRIOR HEARING. ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO BE EQUIPPING EVERY MUNICIPALITY WITH SOME MEANS RUDIMENTARY AS IT MAY BE A SIREN SYSTEM AND OUT EN EL READ SPEAKER SYSTEM. SO THAT WE HAVE A FAIL SAFE MECHANISM FOR COMMUNICATING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I AM I AM LESS CONCERNED WITH HOW WE WAIT YEARS UPON YEARS. TO REFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROBABLY ALREADY NEED SOME REFORMING WE KNOW THESE FIRES ARE IMMINENT. WHAT DO WE DO TO SAVE LIVES? NOW. SO I'M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT THAT NOT EVERY COMMUNITY IS THE SAME IN VERY DANCE PORTIONS OF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE ELECTRIC GRID AND POOR AND MUCH OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION GRID. KIND OF LOOKS MORE LIKE AN A MASH WITH MANY DIFFERENT LINES THEY CROSS AND WHERE THE WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY. HAVE SERVICE MOVE FROM ONE PLOY LINE TO ANOTHER IF THERE IS A FAILURE AND SOME PORTION OF THE LINE -- EQ YOU CAN YOU CAN GET IT UP FAIRLY QUICKLY AND BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE EDGES AND OUT INTO THOSE REMOTE OR COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE LINE THAT STRINGS OUT OVER MANY MANY MANY MILES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO USE A MASH. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE SO ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOLUTIONS ARE GONNA PROBABLY APPLIED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. BUT IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE NOT MAINTAINING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS YOU SAID IN TERMS REFORM. EVERYTHING IS JOURNAL YOUR RISK EVERYWHERE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME REAL CLEAR STANDARDS IN CAN CAN HOLD THE PROVIDERS TO THOSE STANDARDS. WHAT CAN I JUST SAY ON THE SIREN ISSUE IT LOOKS YOU KNOW SIRENS AND OTHER FORMS OF? OF AUDIBLE ALERTING. DO WORK IN PARTS OF OUR STATE WE WE HAVE SIRENS SYSTEMS. ARE A LOT IN OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES MOSTLY BECAUSE OF A TSUNAMI -- RELATED THREAT -- AND AND THERE ARE COMMITTEES AT THE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM ONE TODAY THAT THEY DID STATES. IF THOUGHTS FOR WERE USING -- A SIREN SORT OF AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TO TO LEARN -- RESIDENTS. SIRENS CAN BE EFFECTIVE -- THERE ARE AGAIN COMPLEXITIES WITH SIRENS THAT THERE THERE THERE ARE WITH THAT THE EXISTING CELL SITES WHAT THEY THEY NEED TO BE MAINTAINED IT HAS TO BE IN A EXTENSIVE -- COMMUNICATION UP SORRY A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT GOES WITH THEM -- YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UP OTHER TESTED REGULARLY. THERE'S A LOT TO DO TO ENSURE THAT SIRENS ARE IN PLACE -- DIFFERENT TONES MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS -- MAYBE. YOU'RE TRADING OFF ONE THING TO GET ANOTHER TO TO SOME DEGREE. SENDING THAT IS SO I MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SPEED S. A SIREN AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN THIS AND IF YOU'RE A VISITOR COMING THROUGH AN AREA -- THEORETICALLY USING THE THE THE NEW COULD ALERT AND WARNING GUIDELINES YOU COULD GET A LATE MORNING ON YOUR CELL PHONE IF YOU HEARD A SITE WHERE YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT THAT. WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN SO THERE'S TRADE OFFS -- BUT THERE ARE APPLICATIONS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US -- THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION IF IT WORKS FOR THEM. GERMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND TESTIMONY PRESENTED. ALRIGHT SO I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PANEL PLEASE. WE HAVE SHAUNA GLANDS CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. UNDER SHERIFF JOHN CRAWFORD NAPA COUNTY REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. CHRISTOPHER GODLY DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CINEMA COUNTY REPRESENTING THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. ENSURE OF COREY HONAN BUTTE COUNTY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. GERMAN THANK YOU WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. AND YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY SENATOR ANY. THANK YOU -- COMMITTEE -- SHAMA GLENN OF THE CITY MANAGER FROM THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. ON OCTOBER EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN A SERIES OF SMALL WILDFIRES FUELED BY HIGH WINDS. FORM SIX MASSIVE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE THOSE FIRES WITH THE TUBS FIRE WHICH CROSSED INTO SANTA ROSA IN THE EARLY HOURS OF OCTOBER NINTH. THE TUBS FIRE BURN THROUGH HOMES THROUGHOUT SANTA ROSA'S HILLSIDES JUMP SIX LANES OF HIGHWAY ONE A ONE AND SWEPT INTO SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL AREAS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE. THE NUNS FIRE WHICH BEGAN ON OCTOBER EIGHTH BECAME THE LARGEST OF THE WINE COUNTRY FIRES AND ALSO IMPACTED SANTA ROSA. DURING THE SPREAD OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN FIRES IN CINEMA COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS WENT DOOR TO DOOR FRANTICALLY OF TO THE FRANTICALLY EVACUATE. RESIDENTS IN SOME AREAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. NEIGHBORS HELPING TO WAKE NEIGHBORS BECAME A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE. EMERGENCY INFORMATION WAS DISSEMINATED BY THE CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS VIA EMERGENCY LEARNING TOOLS AND THROUGH THE USE OF NEXT SOUL SOCIAL MEDIA. AND RAPID COMMUNICATION WITH THE NEWS MEDIA. THE SYSTEMS WERE USED TO PROVIDE EVACUATION ORDERS DIRECTIONS ON WHERE TO GO SHELTER UPDATES IN OTHER URGENT COMMUNICATIONS THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR MANY DAYS. TO GIVE AN IDEA OF HOW QUICKLY INFORMATION WAS CHANGING AND HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO BE REACHED DURING THE CRISIS. CONSIDER THESE FIGURES. AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CITIZENS. EVACUATED THEIR HOMES HOTELS OR PLACE OF OCCUPANCY THROUGH THE COUNTY DURING THE FIRES THE CITY OPENED ITS FIRST SHELTER TWELVE FORTY FIVE AM ON OCTOBER NINTH AT THE COMMUNITY FAMILY CENTER. THE SHELTER WAS FULL BY THREE THIRTEEN AM AN ADDITIONAL FORTY THREE SHELTERS ALSO OPENED COUNTY WIDE. THE CITY'S EOC PUBLIC INFORMATION LINE FIELD AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALLS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FROM OCTOBER EIGHTH TWO OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST. IN TOTAL TWENTY FOUR LIVES WERE LOST IN CINEMA COUNTY MORE THAN FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOMES DESTROYED AS A RESULT OF THE FIRES. SANTA ROSA EXPERIENCE THE UNIMAGINABLE IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT AS WE SAW JUST A YEAR LATER IT CAN HAPPEN IN WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE FIRES OUR COMMUNITY HAS FOCUSED ON NUMBER WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO REACT SOONER IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE THREAT. CINEMA COUNTY IS INVESTED IN THE NETWORK OF ADVANCE WARNING FIRE CAMERAS THAT HAVE BEEN STALLED IN STRATEGIC VANTAGE POINTS. THE CAMERAS ALLOW FOR GREATER ADVANCE NOTICE AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF A FIRE THREAT. EVEN WHEN THE FIRE STARTS IN A NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION. WE ARE INCREASING FIREFIGHTING STAFFING LEVELS AND EQUIPMENT ON RED FLAG DAYS ALLOWING FOR QUICKER AND MORE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE OF RESOURCES IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE THREAT. WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED THE USE OF SOME OF OUR EMERGENCY ALERT NOTIFICATION TOOLS WITHIN THE COUNTY AND TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE DITION ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEMS -- SHARING THEIR RELIABLE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN THE PLACE OF TO DISSEMINATE URGENT INFORMATION DURING AN EMERGENCY IS CRITICAL. MAKING SURE WE HAVE A WAY TO DEAL WITH KNOWN THREATS THAT MAY COMPROMISE THE SYSTEM IS PARAMOUNT. AS PGA ANY AMPLE IN ITS NEW MEDICATION MEASURES DURING CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATION CONCERNS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES MUST CONSIDER. A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF FIRE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA RADIO CABLE TELEVISION INTERNET SERVICE THAT WOULD IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY. PUBLIC SECTOR AND COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS. PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO REPEATERS AND THE ABILITY TO CALL 911- COULD BE COPPER ICE ONCE BATTERY BACKUPS DIE OR GENERATORS RUN OUT OF FUEL. OUR COMMUNITIES ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM COULD BE CRIPPLED AND IT WOULD BE AT A CRUCIAL TIME DURING THE CRITICAL FIRE SEASON. DURING A P. S. P. S. WE COULD EVENTUALLY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO USE WE ARE. AND OUR LOCAL VERSION OF THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE TO ALERT ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT HAVE A LAND LINE. CELLPHONE TOWERS NOT EQUIPPED WITH GENERATORS AND FUEL SUPPLIES HAVE LIMITED BATTERY LIFE POTENTIALLY ONLY A FEW HOURS WHICH MEANS CALLS 291-1 AND AND ANYWHERE ELSE WE WOULD ALSO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERSON DIDN'T HAVE A LAND LINE. SO FAR CELL PHONE PROVIDERS HAVE NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING WITH THEIR PLANS FOR MEDICATING A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. TO KEEP THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE RUNNING. THEREFORE AT THIS POINT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE LEFT TO ASSUME THE WORST CASE SCENARIO. WE MUST BE ABLE TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CELL PHONE CARRIERS ON THIS ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY DURING A PS PS WE DO NOT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THOSE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS HOW DO WE LET THEM KNOW A P. S. P. IS IMPENDING DEPENDING HOW DO WE KNOW IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE DURING A P. S. P. S. OF THAT. THIS REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ACROSS OUR COUNTY. AT PRESENT PEACHY ANY IS ONLY GOING TO CHECK ON THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS. THIS IS NOT REPRESENTED OF THE ENTIRE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. LOCAL AGENCIES MAY NEED TO RESORT TO DOOR TO DOOR CHECKS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW ABOUT. IN AN EMERGENCY THIS COULD BE DIFFICULT DO CAN TO ALREADY CONSTRAINED RESOURCES AND EFFORT. AND THE EFFORT MAY NOT COVER THE ENTIRE POPULATION AT RISK. MAKING SURE RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND WHAT A P. S. P. S. IS AND AND ARE WELL PREPARED IN THE EVENT OF ONE IS IMPORTANT. ENSURING THAT NEIGHBORS ARE ABLE TO ASSIST NEIGHBORS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WERE MADE A CURSE CRITICAL PONY. TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES DURING A P. S. P. S. AT THAT. BUT IS THAT TRULY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS -- THEN WE NEED THIS REDUNDANCY AND AND WORKING WITH OUR WIRELESS CARRIERS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL BACKBONE UNDER WHICH WE COMMUNICATE TO OUR COMMUNITY. DURING A LOOK SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN AND ANY OTHER TYPES OF MURMURS EMERGENCY RESPONSE WE HAVE AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. THE FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN CRAWFORD ON THE NAPA COUNTY UNDERSHERIFF -- BUT AS WE ALL KNOW OCTOBER EIGHTH -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BEGAN THE ATLAS FIRE NAPA COUNTY -- ONCE IT IS ESSENTIALLY RESOLVED ITSELF SURE OF ROBERTSON -- DIRECTED US AS A TEAM -- TO TRY TO KEEP AS HE PUT IT KEEP THE BUS MOVING FORWARD TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE RIVER MAYOR TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. WE'VE TAKEN ESSENTIALLY A THREE PRONGED APPROACH TO THAT AT THIS POINT -- THE IRONIC PART OF OCTOBER NINTH WAS WHEN THE SUN CAME UP IN NAPA AND WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OF TAKE A LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHAT. WAS HAPPENING THIS WILL BE MAYBE BETTER REPORTED BACK TO THE SEES -- AS THE SUN CAME UP THE SAILOR TOWERS WENT DOWN HAS DID THE VOICE OVER INTERNET. CABLE BASED PHONES SO WE LOST THAT COMMUNICATION. ABILITY -- SO WE ARE ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. TAKEN ABACK TO ALL TECHNOLOGY IF YOU WILL. WE ARE USING WHAT'S CALLED A HIGH LOS IRON -- ITS IT'S AN OLDER SIREN THAT WAS -- SOMEWHAT USE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I BEGAN MY CAREERS NO LONGER IN USE FOR ANY TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. MOST AGENCIES DON'T HAVE IT AVAILABLE IN THEIR VEHICLES ANYMORE -- BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF IT -- FOR FAMILIAR WITH IT SOUTH THE SENTRY LIKE EUROPEAN. THE SERVICE SORRY -- AGAIN AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES WITH -- SORT OF A STATIONARY.SIRENS SYSTEM -- THERE'S ENGINEERING STUDIES HAVE NEED TO BE DONE IN A COUNTY LIKE NOW BUT IT'S VERY RURAL ONE MOUNTAINOUS WERE SOCIALLY A SERIES OF VALLEY'S. IT BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE REALLY -- WITHOUT SINCE THE EXTREMES NEVER GET LAID OUT OF CAPITAL -- TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT A REALITY SO WHAT WE DID. WAS WE TOOK THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAD. FOR ABOUT A COST OF ABOUT SIX DOLLARS A VEHICLE WE HAD TO REPROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE HIGH LOS IRON -- BEEN WE'VE BEEN EDUCATING OUR COMMUNITY WITH WITHOUT REACH THROUGH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THE NEWS MEDIA ANYWAY WE CAN TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE SOUND SOUNDS LIKE AND WHAT IT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS IS AND THE SORT OF ORGANICALLY DURING THE FIRES -- OUR LOCAL RADIO STATION -- BECAME. SORT DISPENSER OF INFORMATION AND SO WHEN WE TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE HIGH LOS ARE AND WE TELL THEM TO CHECK THEIR USUAL SOURCES OF OF NEWS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT WE ALSO MENTION THAT THE RADIO IS NOW -- WERE WAS SORT O ORGANIC THE FIRST TIME IT'S IT'S WORKED ENORMOUS THE ARMORS THE SERVICES PLAN AT THIS POINT. THAT WILL BE WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR INFORMATION SHOULD EVERYTHING ELSE FAIL AS IT DID -- SECONDLY. WE'VE -- WE SAW A LOT OF SORT OF ANECDOTAL. STORIES OF PEOPLE. THAT WERE WAITING TO BE TOLD TO EVACUATE -- ADDITIONALLY WE YOU KNOW WE WE YEAH IN A MORE RURAL ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU WE SEND DEPUTIES ARE OFFICERS OUT DIVIDE TO EIGHT PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT -- SOME OF THESE DRIVE WAYS OR A HUNDRED YARDS LONG EVERY WILL MAINTAIN SOME OF THEM COULD BE A MILE LONG VERY POORLY MAINTAINED. AND WE CAN RUN A TO OBSTACLES SUCH AS GATES OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO PASS THROUGH -- YOU KNOW TREES DOWN ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. SO -- WHAT WE CAME UP WITH TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN PARTIALLY? IS -- WE CREATE AN EVACUATION TO WHICH HERE'S EXAMPLE OF IT. AND WE MADE THESE AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY THAT WANTS ONE ARE COUNTY. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE IDEA WITH THIS IS IS TWO FOLD AGAIN. ONE IF WE ARE OUT FORMING EVACUATION IN THE CITIZENS PLACE THIS ON THEIR DOOR THEIR MAILBOX THEIR GATE. A YOU KNOW A TREE BUT THE INTO THEIR DRIVEWAY WILL KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA WE CAN MOVE ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING TO TAKE IN THAT TIME IT TAKES TO DRIVE A HALF A MILE. THROUGH BURNING EMBERS OR WHATEVER -- WE CAN MOVE ON TO SOMEBODY THAT STILL NEEDS OUR HELP. SECONDLY WHAT THIS DOES IS IT EMPOWERS PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR US TO TELL THEM IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE -- IF THEY SEE A FIRE COMING IN THEIR DIRECTION -- WE HOPE THAT THEY REMEMBER THAT THIS TAG IS SORT IN A SENSE GIVES THEM THAT AUTHORITY IS AND THAT EMPOWERMENT. TO EVACUATE THEMSELVES AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT. TO A TO A FOUR LASTLY. WHAT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IS WE'VE BEEN WE'VE PARTNERED WITH CAL FIRE -- TO CREATE THESE EVACUATION PLAN PAMPHLETS IT'S PART OF THE READY SET GO PROGRAM. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS INCLUDES IS -- INFORMATION HOW TO PREPARE YOURSELVES -- WHICH IS THREE SIGNAL PROGRAM AND IT ALSO INCLUDES A MAP WITH PREFERRED ROUTES AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IF THE INTERNET'S DOWN OF YOUR NOT ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR CELL PHONE YOU'RE NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGS NECESSARILY. THIS HAS PREFERRED EVACUATION ROUTES IT DOES NOT HAVE AN EVACUATION PLAN WE LEAVE THAT UP TO THE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE WE ALSO -- MAN OUR DISPATCHER RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN TOLD TO EVACUATE. THE SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO GO OVER ASKING OUR DISPATCHERS TO TELL WHERE TO GO SO AS PART OF OUR OUT REACH. WE REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO BE AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND THEY AGAIN NEED TO BE EMPOWERED. TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DECIDE THE BEST WAY. BASED ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WE CAN'T THROUGH A PHONE LINE TO A WHICH WITH FIRES ADVANCING ON THEM WHICH WAY THEIR DRIVEWAY -- GOES -- WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BEST ROUTE TO TAKE SO. IN A NUTSHELL THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS ESSENTIAL THAT WERE WORKING ON AN APP COUNTY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE SMITH AND SIGNATURE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON CHRISTOPHER GODLY WITH COUNTY CINEMA WHERE I SERVICES DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS SESSION IT'S A SUBJECT VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO THE HEARTS OF SOME COUNTY RESIDENTS. HAS CLEARLY EVIDENCED BY -- HI THE RECENT TESTIMONY I WOULD MENTION THAT FOLLOWING THAT FIRESTORM OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COUNTIES TO IN A VERY BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT -- TO HIS DECISION AT THE TIME NOT TO USE THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT OF COURSE THE COUNTY OR TOOK A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND VERY FOCUSED REVIEW. OF ITS EMERGENCY ALERT WARNING CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION RESOURCES AT HAND. THAT EXPERIENCE IS FOR THE COUNTY TO REALLY MOVE FORWARD NOW TO DEVELOP FIRST CLASS COMPREHENSIVE COUNTY WIDE COMMUNITY ALERT WARNING PROGRAM. WHICH AND INCORPORATE SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DISCUSSION TODAY REALLY ALSO ADDRESSES QUESTIONS A POLICY. THE ABILITY TO GET REAL TIME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT NEED TO ISSUE ALERT WARNINGS. AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SAID THE RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND WHICH WARNING SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT THEY SHOULD DO ONCE THEY BEGIN TO RECEIVE WARNINGS. BECAUSE HERE IT'S FROM A CAN WE TRULY DO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COUNTY GOVERNMENT IS REALLY CENTER OF GRAVITY FOR THE ALERT WARNING EFFORTS FOR MOST OF OUR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. ON ESSENTIALLY FOR ALERT WARNING COUNTIES WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD. AND SO TO THAT END WE'VE BEGAN DEVELOPING AND WE'VE MOVED PAST ANALYSIS AND RESOURCING. AND PROGRAMMING AND WE'RE MOVING FULLY IN TEMPERAMENT TATIAN NOW. AND WE FOUND FOR CHALLENGES THAT MAY BE. DIRECTLY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. THE FIRST OF COURSE IS PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS SERVICE. THAT HAS EVOLVED RADICALLY ALONG WITH TECHNOLOGY OF THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE ALL BECOME USED TO HAVING CELL PHONE DEVICES. DIGITAL DATA AT OUR FINGERTIPS THAT ALLOWS TO MERELY ENGAGE WITH AND INTERACT WITH THE WORLD. USUALLY VIA ROBUST COMMERCIAL GRADE SYSTEMS ARE WELL RESOURCE FINANCED INVENTED. ON THE PUBLIC DOES EXPECT IN A NO NOTICE OF THAT. LIKE A WILDFIRE T GET NOTIFICATION WITHIN MINUTES THEY'RE NOT GONNA WAIT AROUND FOR HOURS SAYING BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION ALMOST REAL TIME. THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T OFTEN TO LOCAL WARNING SYSTEMS THAT THE GOVENMENT SHOULD HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO FIND THEM. WAKE THEM UP. AND DELIVER INFORMATION ON THE DEVICE OF THEIR CHOICE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY PREFER. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE AN INSTANTANEOUS. IF YOU WOULD BIRDS EYE VIEW OF WHAT'S GOING ON A FULL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS THAT THEY CAN THEN CONVEY TO THE RESIDENTS WHEN OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE. ON THE RESIDENTS ALSO EXPECTED MANY THESE LOWER WARNING SYSTEMS TO GET IN REAL TIME VERY SPECIFIC AND DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS. AS TO WHAT ACTIONS THEY SHOULD TAKE. WHICH ROUTES SHOULD THEY TAKE WHAT SHOULD THEY TAKE WITH THEM WHERE SHOULD THEY GO. AND THEN FINALLY. RESIDENTS TO EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CORROBORATE THIS INFORMATION IN NEAR REAL TIME. A SINGLE WARNING OR SINGLE ALERT MESSAGE IS USUALLY NOT ENOUGH TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO ACTION. THEY HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD SOURCE OF INFORMATION BEFORE THEY MOVE INTO ACTION. AND EXPECT THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT THAT -- IS PRESENT PICKING INDICATE A PEASANT PICKER OF CP SYNDICATE WE'D TO CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT TEST IN SUMMER COUNTY. TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHETHER THE SYSTEMS PERFORM -- AND HE HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF OUR FINDINGS I WOULD SUGGEST AN UNNATURAL THAT ESSENTIALLY THE SYSTEMS NO MATTER WHICH TECHNOLOGY WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY. SIMPLY DID NOT PERFORM AS ADVERTISED IN EACH ONE OF THESE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE GAPS. TECHNOLOGICAL HURDLES CHALLENGES BECAUSE HE'S TECHNOLOGIES ARE RELATIVELY. JUNIOR TECHNOLOGIES COMPARED T THEIR MORE OLDER AND WELL RESOURCE TOLD -- COMMERCIAL BRETHREN. THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY ALERT WARNING. THESE PROGRAMS THESE APPLICATIONS. THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF EXERCISES ARE NOT NEARLY AS ROBUST AND AS RESILIENT AS THE LARGER COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS BASICALLY TO BE HONEST WITH OUR COMMUNITIES I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHILE WE MIGHT TRY TO REACH THEM. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GUARANTEE IT THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION MAINTAIN THEIR OWN AWARENESS AND CONNECTING WITH OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORS. AND THEN FINALLY REALLY URGE OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S INTEL COMMISSION COMMUNICATIONS ALERT WARNING. TO REALLY IMPROVE THEIR ABILITIES TO MEET THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY LIVE NOW. MOST OF US ARE ONLINE SOMETIMES WE STILL CANNOT DELIVER WARNING MESSAGES TO PEOPLE FOR ONLINE. WITH ARE WATCHING SATELLITE TV IF THEY'RE NOT A LOCAL CHANNEL WE CAN'T REACH THEM. OUR COMMUNITY HAS MOVED ON USED TO COMMUNITY OUR COMMITTEES HAVE MOVED ON USED TECHNOLOGIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. OUR LORTON WARNING SYSTEMS HAVE TO MAINTAIN THAT PACE AS WELL. IN GENERALIZATIONS WAS NOTED IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE I WILL. POINT OUT FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEFS THAT THEY'RE ALL SITTING WITH OTHER CHALLENGES TO AGGREGATION OF THEIR OWN CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND. THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ISSUES SUCH AS POTENTIALLY LOSS OF WATER SUPPLIER PRESSURE. THE REAL NIGHTMARE IS SPEAK TURN OFF THE POWER THE CELL PHONE TOWERS FAIL DUE TO LACK OF BACKUP TAKE OFF LINE. AND THEN A WILD FIRE BREAKS OUT. NOW WE HAVE NO WAY TO REACH THESE PEOPLE TERE ARE HARMS WAY OUR OF VALUATION AT OPERATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY COMPROMISED AS WELL. SO IN MANY WAYS -- THE CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIA IS THAT WHILE WE MAY BE WORKING TO PREVENT WILDFIRE CONDITIONS. WE MAY BE IN FACT INCREASING THE ACTUAL IMPACTS A WILDFIRE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DURING THESE GENERALIZATION OFFENSE [inaudible] AS DIRECTOR GIL TO G. ALSO POINTED OUT. THESE WIRELESS BROADBAND INTERNET CAPABILITIES IN THE SYSTEMS ARE NO LONGER SIMPLY UTILITIES THEY'RE NOT JUST A WAY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. THEY REALLY BECOME EFFECTIVELY CRITICAL LIFE AND DEATH INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT AND OPERATED AS SUCH. FINALLY AXIS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS IS AN AREA OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. BECAUSE MOST OF OUR ALERT WARNING SYSTEMS DO NOT ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND SERVICE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT SUFFER FROM A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES IN ALERT WARNING IS WELLS RESPONDING TO DISASTERS AS A WHOLE. THE TERM AXIS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS IS IN FACT NOT ACTUALLY WELL DEFINED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE NO BENCHMARKS FOR HOW TO PERFORM. IN TRYING TO DEVELOP ALERT MORNING PROGRAM SERVICES TO DELIVER -- FULL CAPABILITIES THE AXLE AXIS AND FROM FROM THESE COMMUNITY. UNDER THE CONCEPT OF NOTHING FOREST WITHOUT AS WE TWO NEED TO ENGAGE BETTER A LARGER SET. HAVE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS STAKEHOLDERS AT A POLICY LEVEL. TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS TRULY IN WELLIES SERVE THOSE WHO MOST MAY NEED A WARNING SENATE FINALLY I WILL. SUGGEST THAT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES LEADERSHIP AND MONEY. THE PROBABLY GET THIS ALL THE TIME -- BUT I'M SURE WITH YOU IT'S REALLY GONNA TAKE POLITICAL MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS. AS A COUNTIES LOOK TO DEVELOP THEIR CAPABILITIES IN THIS AREA. OUR RECENT ACTIONS MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME. IDEA OF THE SCALE OF EFFORT THAT SEATED. FIRST OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO ELEVATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WITHIN COUNTY GOVERNMENT IT'S NOW AN INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT. I ISA DIRECTOR NOW REPORT DIRECTLY TO COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR. PART OF THE WILDFIRES TO THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFF. I SPENT LITTLE TIME EACH MONTH DOING ALERT WARNING SYSTEM MAINTENANCE TRAINING -- MAYBE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED HOURS A YEAR THAT'S FOR POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO NOW WE'VE GONE FROM THAT PART TIME EFFORT TO TO DEDICATED FULL TIME ALERT WARNING PROGRAM STAFF. BECAUSE YOU CAN HEARTHE COMPLEXITIES THE SYSTEMS CAN OVERWHELM QUITE EASILY ANYONE THAT. ONLY HAS A FEW HOURS A MONTH TO DO WITH THIS. WE'VE ALSO GREASER SPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY FROM EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE. SOON TOTAL ARE LOWER OUR NEW ALERT WARNING PROGRAM RUNS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR OUT OF GENERAL FUND. ALMOST A DOLLAR PER RESIDENT AND THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM ALSO ENJOYS. THANK YOU SHOULD BENCHMARK FOR COUNTY IS OF SOME HAVE STEPPED TO TO PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS HIS PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY WE DO NEED TO BETTER INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGIES -- THAT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL TO GOVERNMENT. LIKE A WEBSITE IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO SET ONE UP COUNTIES BEEN DOING IT FOREVER. EXCEPT IT DOESN'T WORK ON DISASTER DOESN'T SCALE IT WILL FAIL IN TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD IT'S NOT DYNAMIC ENOUGH. IT'S RECRUITED A NEW WEBSITE THAT AUTOMATICALLY POPULATES ONE WARNING MESSAGE USE ISSUED WITH THAT EXACT WARNING MESSAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND A MAP OF THE AREA TO BE WARNED. SO PEOPLE CAN GO TO THAT WEBSITE. OFF OF A TINY YOUR L. IN THE MESSAGES SENT TO THEM THEY CAN CORPORATE THE INFORMATION TODAY JUST HURT OR THEY DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THE WE SAID ON THE VOICE MESSAGE THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT IN WRITING. SO CINEMA COUNTY LIKE MANY OF HER PEERS IS WORKING HARD TO MAKE ALERT WARNING MEANINGFUL FOR RESIDENTS AND WE SUGGEST IS CAN TAKE MORE THAN TECHNOLOGY. MORE THAN GUIDANCE AND MORE THAN GOOD INTENTIONS IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT ANSON IF CAN'T RESOURCES. TO DEVELOP A TRULY EFFECTIVE SUSTAINABLE -- WARNING CAP CAPABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. SURE SMITH JR SANTIAGO ARMORS A COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU MY NAME IS COREY HONEY I'M THE SHERIFF OF BIãU COUNTY. HI MY COUNTY ARE NO STRANGERS TO MERCY -- MORNINGS AND EVACUATIONS. DURING MY TENURE SHERIFF. MY DEPARTMENT MY COMMITTEE HAD THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY CRISIS WHICH RESULTED IN A MASS EVACUATION. OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY IT IMPACTED TO TO COUNTIES TO THE SOUTH OF US A SOUTHERN YUBA AS WELL. IN ADDITION THAT WE HAD -- A SERIES OF FIRES THAT FOLLOW THAT -- THAT WEREN'T NEARLY AS NOTABLE SOME THE FOR TODAY -- BUT WE DID INDEED HAVE TO IMPLEMENT ARE WARNING SYSTEM THAT OUR VALUATION PROTOCOLS. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE A CAMPFIRE OCCURRED. IN BUTTE COUNTY IT IS TODAY I HOPE REMAINS TODAY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE. AND DEADLY FIRE IN THIS DETAILED HISTORY STUDY CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY WOULD WISH THAT UPON ANY OTHER COMMUNITY. TO COME TO YOU WITH THAT LOVE BASE OF EXPERIENCE AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM PLEASED TO HEAR SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND I'D LIKE TO AMPLIFY CERTAINLY WHAT UNDERSERVED CRAWFORD SAID A MISTER GODLY SAID -- WITH REGARD -- TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IN TERMS OF MANAGING THE COMMUNITIES EXPECTATIONS AND INSPIRING IN THEM A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. YOU RECEIVED A PRIMER I THINK ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH REGARD TO MERCY OF WARNING SYSTEMS I THINK IT'S A GOOD OVERVIEW. AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT WILL MY OTHER COLLEAGUES OF SAID WITH REGARD TO THE NEED TO INCREASE RELIABILITY AMAZON REDUNDANCY WITHIN THE TECHNOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK THAT WE USED TO NOTIFY PEOPLE. THE FACT THE MATTER IS WE RELY UPONTECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ALERT -- THE SIGNIFICANT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS IT RELIES UPON TECHNOLOGY AND IN THE SEARCH OF THE SERVICE CIRCUMSTANCES TECHNOLOGY ULTIMATELY FAILS OR CAN FILTER IT RATHER RATHER QUICKLY. CERTAINLY INCREASING RELIABILITY OR DENNIS HE WOULD -- MITIGATE THOSE RISKS BUT QUITE FRANKLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD EVER GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ENSURE. WITH 1100% CERTAINTY THAT TECHNOLOGY WON'T FAIL. WHAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS IN TERMS OF WARNING PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS? YOU HAVE -- TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT BUT WHEN YOU MESSAGE ACROSS PLATFORMS THAT ARE AGAIN BASED ON TECHNOLOGY. YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THAT TECHNOLOGY FAILS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ORVILLE SPILL INTO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO STUDY AND ULTIMATELY CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ALERT PEOPLE. OF A THREAT. TO THEIR LIVES HAVE A UNIFORMED LAW ENFORCEMENT OR KNOCK ON THEIR DOOR UNTIL THEY NEED TO LEAVE THE MEDIA ARE GOING TO DIE. BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IS NOT ENOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN ANY COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S A PRETTY LOW TECHNOLOGY WAY TO NOTIFY PEOPLE THAT'S VERY EFFECTIVE BUT IT'S JUST NOT PRACTICAL. SO WHAT ULTIMATELY LEARN FROM ALL OF THIS IS HIS FIRST AND FOREMOST. DESPITE OUR ABSOLUTE BEST EFFORTS AND OUR NEED TO PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD. THERE IS NO WAY TO GUARANTEE AND THEN SECONDLY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL DO WHAT YOU ASK HIM TO DO OR WHAT THEY NEED. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS PEOPLE OFTEN AS YOU HEARD A NOR THE WARNING. BUT MORE TRAGICALLY THAN THAT IS THERE NOT BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE WARNING. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS -- CERTAINLY THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT. BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AGAIN TO MANAGE THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND INSPIRE SINCE RESPONSIBILITY IN THEM. BUT THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES EVEN WITH SOURCES THAT THAT -- AREN'T TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY GATHER THE INFORMATION -- THAT ARE BASED ON TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO REACT TO THAT INFORMATION. THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE IN IN GOVERNMENT OR WE IN PUBLIC SAFETY CAN TAILOR A WARNING SYSTEM OR EVACUATION PLAN THAT MEETS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. THERE HAS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PART INDIVIDUAL TO KNOW WHAT. THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS ARE WITH THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE ARE HOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND THEN WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN IN A CRISIS AND YOU'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT. US PUTTING OUT A WARNING -- PUTTING OUT WARNINGS TELLING PEOPLE EVACUATED THEM CALLING ASKING WHICH ROUTE. WAS NO WAY FOR US TO KNOW WHICH ROUTE BECAUSE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY DETERMINE WHICH WAY THE FIRES COMING OR WHICH WITH A FLOOD IS COMING OR WHAT THE SITUATION IS. TO PEOPLE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN. AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST HER WHOLE SEGMENT OF OUR OUR POPULATION PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS. A WHO HAVE. TO AFTER A PLAN IN PLACE AHEAD OF TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GET OUT BUT THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS. MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD -- EVACUATE FROM THE CAMPFIRE WOULDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE THEY HAD ANIMALS THAT THEY COULDN'T EVACUATED THEY WOULD WANT TO LEAVE THOSE ANIMALS. SO A WHATEVER THAT INDIVIDUAL'S SPECIFIC NEEDS ARE -- WE HAVE. TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND INFORM THEM AND AGAIN INSPIRE IN THEM A SENSE RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A PLAN AHEAD OF TIME. BECAUSE FRANKLY WHEN IT'S TIME TO PUT OUT THE WARNING YOU'RE ALREADY IN DANGER THAT'S NOT THE PLAN TO PREPARE THAT'S NOT THE TIME TO PREPARE THAT'S NOT THE TIME TO PLAN. THAT'S THE TIME FOR YOU TO EXECUTE THE PLAN THAT YOU'VE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE. AS WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOMAN PROCEEDED MISTER SANTIAGO QUESTIONS. YEAH AND IF I CAN -- MISTER SURE LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- IS KIND OF INTRIGUING FOR ME IS TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE GONNA SELL PHILIP SOME POINT IN TIME RIGHT. SO THE QUESTION BUT FOR ME ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES -- THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED BOTH FROM A GOVERNMENT AGENCY STANDPOINT AND FROM A PRESENT STANDPOINT. AND IF YOU MIGHT ALSO JUST JUMP IN ON SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY PIECES AND TELL ME WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONES -- THAT YOU SEEN IN REACHING PEOPLE BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO -- WHAT WERE THE BEST NEW COMMUNITY IN RELATIONSHIP TO TECHNOLOGY -- ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES IN GOVERNMENT AND BEST PRACTICES FOR RESIDENT WHEN THIS HAPPENS. CLOSER THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY IF I HAD THE THE CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE WE PROBABLY WITH THE NEED FOR THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT -- THAT SAID -- WHAT I'M HOPING TO CONVEY IS THAT THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE? SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND CERTAINLY -- HAVING MULTIPLE WAYS TO COMMUNICATE PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE ARE BASED IN TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THE WIRELESS SOLAR SYSTEM I PAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA TRADITIONAL MEDIA. I EVEN THE SIREN SYSTEMS IS A IS A FORM OF TECHNOLOGY THAT -- DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- COULD WORK WELL IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES NOT SO WELL AND I'VE OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SIRENS IN. AND I THINK SIRENS WORK IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHEN THEY WARN ABOUT ONE THREAT WITH ONE RESPONSE WHEN YOU START ADDING MULTIPLE THREATS MULTI WERE SPONSORS IT BECOMES A LESS EFFECTIVE SYSTEM LET'S LET'S FIGURE SYSTEM. BUT I SEE THAT A COME BACK TO THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT -- I THINK WE'RE MISSING PART OF THE BOAT HERE IF WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON GOVERNMENTS -- ROLL OR GOVERNMENTS -- CAPABILITIES OF WARNING PEOPLE THROUGH -- THESEVARIOUS WARNING SYSTEMS YOU HAVE TO HAVE. OTHER PLAYERS AT THE TABLE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND CERTAINLY THAT INCLUDES -- THOSE -- ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGICAL BASIS TO DO THE WARNING SYSTEM THAT HAS IMPORTANT PART OF IT BUT IT COME BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HAS TO BE PART OF THIS AS WELL INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I THINK YOU'RE YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR INTRODUCTION. WHEN YOU WENT OUT AND HELD COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND I SUSPECT THERE WAS A LOT OF OUR REACH PARTY COMMITTEE MEETING ABOUT SIGNING UP FOR THE VARIOUS MERCY MASSIVELY KEY SYSTEMS? BUT YOU YOU YOU READY TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHO DIDN'T WHO HAD SIGNED UP FOR IT. THERE IS THIS SENSE OF APATHY AND I THINK PROBLEMS SOMETIMES WHEN. WE BECOME SO DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGY IN KAY AND IN MANY CASES DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL US WHAT TO DO. AND TO WARN US ABOUT THINGS THAT -- WE ALMOST. FOR GO OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO KEEP OURSELVES SAFE AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE PART OF IT MENTOR. WE'LL SEE THE REASON I ASK THAT QUESTION IS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HAS THE PERSON RESPONSIBILITY ABSOLUTELY -- LET ME LET ME STEP BACK FOR A SECOND IN YOUR BED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN DO. TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT A COMMUNITY OR NOT NECESSARILY YOU BUT IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE FACE THE SAME SITUATION KIND OF IN OUR AREA WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS COMES IT BUT THERE'S CERTAIN. THERE'S CERTAIN LEG WORK TO GET DONE IN ADVANCE TO MAKE IT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WERE IT MAY NOT BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M NOT TAKING AWAY ASIDE FROM PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ARE THE THINGS THAT. WE HAVEN'T INVESTED IN OUR THINGS IT WOULD BE A THAT ARE WORKING THAT WE'RE DOING FOR THAT YOU'RE DOING. THAT HELPED TO MAKE THIS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR PEOPLE SO THAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO HAVE WATER I AM AN EX GAY PLAN YOU YOU HAVE A FLASHLIGHT I'M ALL THE BASIC THINGS RIGHT AWAY THE THINGS THAT WE CAN PROMOTE. OR WERE THE BEST AVENUES OF BEST PRACTICES IF YOU SEEN SO DOES BECOME IMPORT. YES SIR I THINK OF A ROBUST PUBLIC OUT REACHES BUSINESS PART OF THAT WHOLE PLAN YOU GOTTA DO YOU YOU'VE GOT TO BE PART OF THAT IS THAT IT HAS TO PARTY PLAN. I I THINK ALSO WE NEED TO START -- HAVING SOMETHING. TO PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE TAKE IT TO THE SCHOOLS AND WE START TALKING ABOUT A MERCY FOR PARENTS WITH A PREPAREDNESS WITH OUR WITH OUR KIDS -- WE TAKE A TOR SERVICE CLUBS WE TAKE A DIVERSE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE -- IN IN A STANDARDIZED PLAN AD THEN THERE'S ALREADY AM I THINK A MODEL FOR THAT THE RACE HAD GROW FOR CO PROGRAM IS PART OF THAT. BUT WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE CAN REALLY START PUTTING TEIR MISSION OUT AND CONVEYED IN MULTIPLE WAYS YOU CAN. YOU KNOW TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK TO THAT A LOT OF LOOKS JUST ME TO BUT MANY THAT MANY THE MEMBERS ARE MANY THE MEMBERS A COMMUNITY IN THE CAMP FIRE. WERE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND FRANKLY THEY DON'T TAP INTO SOCIAL MEDIA -- LIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER GENERATIONS OF MEMBERS A COMEDIAN SO WE MISSED THE BOAT WITH REGARD TO THAT WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE THAT ACROSS MULTIPLE AND NOT TO MENTION IT CAN IT CAN OFTEN BE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT ACCURATE OR INFORMATION THAT IS NOT -- NOT SOUND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. ABSOLUTELY THE OTHER THE OTHER PIECE OF THE STUDENT AND WHY I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS NEED TO INSPIRE. A MANAGE -- EXPECTATIONS OF A COMMUNITIES AS INSPIRE THEM SINCE RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE WELL WE WE DETERMINE -- WHAT WE FOUND? BOTH OF THE SPILL WAY INCIDENT AND ABSOLUTELY WITH THE CAMPERS AND HIS WITHIN. LITERALLY A MATTER OF MINUTES -- ALL OF OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES WERE JUST OVERWHELMED OUR DISPATCH CENTER WAS OVERWHELMED HER FIRST RESPONDERS OR WENT. THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH POLICE OFFICERS THAT WE SHARE SLOT FOR STRUCTURES IN BUTTE COUNTY. TO A NOTIFY EVERYBODY THERE WEREN'T A FIRE ENGINES TO FIGHT THAT FIRE AND SO ULTIMATELY MEMBERS A COMMITTEE HAD A PART OF THE SOLUTION -- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH MEAN CLEARLY FROM GREAT TRAGEDY UNFORTUNATELY COMES YOU KNOW GREAT NECESSITY OF OF INVENTION AND AND YOU REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH KIND OF ENHANCING CREATING YOUR SYSTEMS AND FORMING. ON THE PUBLIC THAT YOU SERVE WE CERTAINLY GOT A LOT OF VERY USEFUL INFORMATION FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE AND FOR OUR FINAL PANEL WE WILL WELCOME UP THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER AND UTILITIES GROUP. STEVE CARLSON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNCIL CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION. TODD WATSON MANAGER OF NETWORK ENGINEERING EIGHTEEN T. CALIFORNIA. HEY SUSE ROMAN CHIEF LEAD COUNSEL VERIZON. CAROLINE MCINTYRE PRESIDENT FOR CC T. A CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION AND AUGUST KEOGH -- DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC THANK YOU ON WELCOME. AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR STEVE CARLSON Và CTIA WHERE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. WE'RE GOING TO START OUT WITH A TODD WATSON OF EIGHTEEN TO YOU WHO'S GOING TO WALK THROUGH -- WHAT DAY OF WHAT EIGHTEEN T. DOES AND OTHER CARRIERS DO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF IT THAT OF A -- OF A DISASTER AND I THINK IT'LL BE MOST INSTRUCTIVE I'M GONNA FOLLOW I'M TALKING ABOUT WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS -- AND HIS WAS FROM MINE WHO'S CHEAP LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL -- FOR VERIZON'S GOING TO CHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD EARLIER AND AND TRY TO GIVE THE CUP THE IDEA. THAT COMMITTEE A PERSPECTIVE OF UP ARGUE WITH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU MADAM AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MISTER CARLSON. MY NAME IS TODD WATSON I AM IN NETWORK ENGINEERING AREA MANAGER WITH A TNT. AND THE LOCAL RESPONSE CENTER COORDINATOR FOR ALL NETWORK PERSONAL ACROSS THE STATE WHEN DISASTER HITS. I HAVE WORKED IN NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY FOR TWENTY ONE OF MY TWENTY TWO YEARS WITH EIGHTEEN T.. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS I'VE WORKED WITH THE LOCAL RESPONSE CENTER AS THE LEAD pCOORDINATOR. WHICH MEANS I ORGANIZE OUR NETWORK PERSONAL ACROSS THE STATE AND COORDINATE A RESPONSE TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS CONNECTED DURING A DISASTER. I MANAGE OPERATIONS INCLUDING EIGHTEEN TEASE DISASTER DEPLOYABLE ASSETS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT ENGINEERS. THESE ARE TEAMS IN THE FIELD DEALING WITH ANY SORT OF HIGHLY COMPLEX ISSUE. INCLUDING RESTORING SERVICE FOLLOWING A VARIETY OF DISASTER SCENARIOS. I'M HERE TO TALK TO TODAY ABOUT WHAT EIGHTEEN T. DOES BEFORE DURING AND AFTER DISASTER. INCLUDING WHAT NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE ADVANCES WE'RE INVESTING. TO IMPROVE OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. WE'VE BEEN BUILDING AND MANAGING AND RESTORING COMMUNICATION NETWORKS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST ADVANCED DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD. WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MAKE THE DECISION TO ISSUE WIRELESS EMERGENCYALERTS? ARE NETWORK USES SALT BROADCAST TECHNOLOGY TO NOTIFY ALL MOBILE DEVICES WITHIN THEIR DESIGNATED ALERTING AREAS. TODAY FEMA'S AYE PA SYSTEMS ALLOWS THESE LOCAL OFFICIALS TO INCLUDE EMBEDDED HYPERLINKS IN THERE WE ARE MESSAGES. CONNECTING CITIZENS WITH VIRTUALLY AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY INFORMATION. AND TRADITIONAL LEARNING TOOLS REMAIN AVAILABLE OVER OUR WIRELINE NETWORK AS WELL SUCH AS AUTOMATED CALLS TO HOME PHONES. AND REGISTERED CELLPHONES COMMONLY KNOWN AS REVERSE. NINE ONE ONE EVERY DISASTER IS DIFFERENT SO WE MUST BE ADAPTABLE TO ANY NUMBER OF VARIABLES. WE BILL THE STATE OF THE ART NETWORK THE RESILIENT TOO MANY THINGS TO GET THROWN AT THEM. WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAM. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO RAPIDLY RESTORE COMMUNICATIONS TO AREAS AFFECTED BY DISASTERS. EIGHTEEN T. IS THE ONLY TELECOM COMPANY WITH DISASTER RESPONSE PROGRAM CERTIFIED BY HOMELAND SECURITY. WE HAVE A FLEET OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PIECES OF NETWORK RESTORATION EQUIPMENT INCLUDING OUR CELL ON WHEELS KNOWN AS CAL'S. SO ON WINGS KNOWN AS FLYING HOUSE. AND SO ON LIGHT TRUCKS KNOWN AS CALLS. AS WELL AS COMMAND CENTERS I. P. RECOVERY TRAILERS HAS MET TRUCKS GENERATORS AND MARK. JUST RECENTLY WE'VE INVESTED OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN A NEARLY FIFTY FOOT TETHER BLIMP. KNOWN AS AN AEROSTAT DON'T PROVIDE FAR REACHING EMERGENCY WIRELESS COVERAGE TO DISASTER IMPACTED LOCATIONS. WE HAVE A STATE OF THE ART WHETHER OPERATIONS CENTER WITH OUR OWN METEOROLOGIST. A GLOBAL NETWORK OPERATIONS CENTER. A TEAM OF OVER FORTY DEDICATED STAFF WHO WORK TO DEPLOY OUR TEMPORARY ASSETS ON A TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN BASIS. ON TOP OF OUR EXISTING FORCE READY IN THE FIELD TO HANDLE ANYTHING THROWN AT THEM. WE EVEN HAVE OUR OWN HAZMAT TEAM. OUR RESPONSE PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THE JUST IN TIME RESPONSE WHEN OUR NETWORK IS IMPACTED. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DESIGNED MULTIPLE LEVELS OF PROTECTION IN OUR NETWORK THERE ARE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS LIKE HURRICANES. CATASTROPHIC FIRES WERE FLOODING THAT WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH. WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE HAVE TEAMS AND EQUIPMENT READY TO MOVE INTO AN AREA? AND RESTORE COMMUNICATIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BEFORE DISASTERS HITS WERE ALREADY IN PREPARATION MODE. THROUGH OUR WEATHER OPERATIONS CENTER WERE MONITORING WEATHER PATTERNS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEATHER THREATS HURRICANES FLOODS WIRE FOUGHT WILD FIRES ECCENTRIC. WORKING WITH THE C. U. E. A AND CALLOW YES AND CAL FIRE TO MONITOR THREATS AND PROTECT OUR NETWORK. IN CALIFORNIA DURING FIRE SEASON WERE ALSO WORKING DIRECTLY WAS SEE YOU EA. THE ASSOCIATION OF UTILITIES THAT IS EMBEDDED IN CALLOW YES. TO MONITOR ANY THREATS THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS MONITORING. MORE RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROACTIVELY RESPONDING TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS BY STAGING PORTABLE GENERATORS IN OR NEAR THE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED SHUT DOWN AREAS. WHEN WE SEE POTENTIAL THREATS TO OUR NETWORK WE'RE PREPARING THROUGH A NUMBER OF WAYS? TESTING OR BACKUP BATTERIES LOCATED CELL SITES CENTRAL OFFICES IN MOBILITY SWITCHING OFFICES. STAGING ADDITIONAL PORTER BOWL GENERATORS FOR ME RESPONSE AND CHECKING OUR EXISTING FIX GENERATORS. TOPPING OFF ALL GENERATORS OF FUEL CELL SITES IN SWITCHING FACILITIES. PERFORMING ALL WATER STOPPING MATERIALS IS IN PLACE IN CABLE FALTERED MANTLE'S. AND SAN BAY USE PLACES WELL. IT IS NOTED EARLIER USING TOOLS SUCH AS WE ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE ABLE TO WARN OR EVEN EVACUATE THEIR COMMUNITIES PRIOR TO IMPENDING THREATS. WHAT'S THESE ASTOR HITS WE ARE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE MODE WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH CAL FIRE AND SEE YOU E. EIGHT TO PROTECT OUR NETWORK FROM FIRE DAMAGE AS WELL AS DETERMINE APPROPRIATE MEANS OF ACCESS. TO THE AFFECTED AREAS. WE DEPLOYED SAT COLD SOUND LIKE COLDS TO ANY COVERAGE AREAS NEEDED. ACTUATION CENTERS FIRST RESPOND OR BASE CAMPS STAGING AREAS EXCEPT. WE DO THIS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN MANY DISASTERS AND WE DO THIS FREE OF CHARGE. IF WE DO HAVE NETWORK IMPACTS WE QUICKLY ASSESS THE NEED AND DEPLOY THE BEST AND FASTEST RESOLUTION POSSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY WE WILL DEPLOYMENT ANY OTHER ASSETS TO EIGHT OR NETWORK RECOVERY. MOBILE CELL SITES MOBILE COMMAND CENTERS. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION VEHICLES A SELF SUFFICIENT BASE CAMP SUPPORT TRAILERS. HAS MEDIC QUITMAN SUPPLIES TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPORT TRAILERS AS WELL AS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES FOR DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND RECOVERY. WE'RE ALSO BUILDING FIRST DEBT WHICH IS HELPING FIRST RESPONDERS BETTER DEAL WITH THE DISASTERS. FIRST IT IS A NEW NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK THE CAME OUT OF THE NINE ELEVEN COMMISSION. WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING AN INTEROPERABLE DEDICATED NETWORK TO FIRST RESPONDERS. EIGHTEEN T. ONE THE NATIONAL BILL TO BUILD FIRST THAT SO THIS MEANS A VERY LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS. FOR IMPROVED RESPONSE. EXPANDING ROLE COVERAGE BOTH THROUGH OUR FIRST NOT BUILD ANSWER CONNECT AMERICA FUND BUILD WE'RE ADDING NEW CELL SITES ACROSS THE STATE IN RURAL AREAS. PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THAT USE FIRST THAT WILL HAVE PRIORITY AND PREEMPTION. MANY OF THE NETWORK BECOMES CONGESTED DURING A DISASTER FIRST RESPONDERS WILL HAVE A PRIORITY. OVERALL FIRST NOW WILL PROVIDE FIRST RESPONDERS ACCESS TO BANDWIDTH AND RELIABLE CONNECTIONS THEY CAN USE TO COMMUNICATE. SHARE INFORMATION AND USE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. FIRST THERE IS ALSO NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE READY SO TOGETHER THAT WILL ENABLE CITIES TO MORE EASILY. QUICKLY AND RELIABLY CONNECT FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE INFO AND CAPABILITIES THEY NEED IN AN EMERGENCY. AFTER A DISASTER. WE HAVE TEAMS OUT IN THE FIELD ASSESSING AND FIXING DAMAGE AS SOON AS IT SAFE TO ENTER. IN MANY CASES THIS IS EVEN BEFORE THE PUBLIC IS ALLOWED BACK INTO THE AREA. ESPECIALLY DURING FIRE SEASON WE KEEP MORE SUPPLIES ON HAND IN CALIFORNIA LIKE FIBER REPAIR EQUIPMENT EXCEPT. AND AREAS THAT ARE SO BADLY DAMAGED THEY REQUIRE REBUILD. WE COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER UTILITIES AND WHEREVER FEASIBLE REBUILD WITH UPGRADED FIBER-NETWORKS. THIS IS PRECISELY THE CASE FOLLOWING THE CAMPFIRE WE'RE 93% OF THE DAMAGED AREA IS BEING CONVERTED. TO FIVE TO SUM UP WE HAVE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO TO DISASTER SITUATIONS. ONE WE DESIGNED THE MOST RESILIENT NETWORK WE CAN. TWO WE EMPLOY A BEST IN CLASS NUMBER DISASTER RECOVERY AND RESPONSE PROGRAM TO GET OR KEEP COMMUNICATIONS UP AND RUNNING. THREE OUR NATION WIDE NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY TEAM AND ASSETS AS WELL AS THE EXPANDED COVERAGE AND VERSATILITY OF FIRST THAT. HELP KEEP FIRST RESPONDERS CONNECTED DURING A DISASTER. WE SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS ON RECOVERY OPERATIONS EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA AND NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT OR TO THE PUBLIC. FINALLY WE ARE COUNTING I'M SORRY WE ARE CONTINUING TO ITERATE AND EXPERIMENT THE STRESS GET WORSE. TWO GREAT EXAMPLES ARE FLYING CAL'S EXTENDING EMERGENCY WIRELESS COVERAGE VIA DRONE AND SOON VIEW BLIMP. I PERSONALLY MEANT DOING NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS MYSELF AND OUR ENTIRE DISASTER RESPONSE IN NETWORK TEAMS ARE DEDICATED TO THIS WORK. AND WE OFTEN DO IT TWENTY FOUR BY. SEVEN WE TAKE PROTECTION OF THE NETWORK AND THE COMMUNICATION NEEDS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. CUSTOMERS AND CITIZENS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF NEED. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR -- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT -- WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS AND WE ARE TODAY AND I THOUGHT I GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL -- WITH THAT -- THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM IS ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX OF LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS AND WE WOULD SUBMIT THE MOST ROBUST TOOL. HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE IN THE YEARS SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE WE A SYSTEM IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITIES MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO TARGET PRESIDENTIAL IMMINENT THREAT AND AMBER ALERTS WARNING THE PUBLIC. OF IMMINENT DANGER SAYS HIS FLOODS TORNADOES FIRES TERRORIST EVENTS AND OTHER INCIDENTS. CITY I'D ITS MEMBER COMPANIES ARE VERY PROUD OF THE WIRELESS INDUSTRIES ROLE IN THE WE HAVE SYSTEM. TODAY THE NATIONWIDE WIRELESS PROVIDERS IN MANY REGIONAL PROVIDER SERVING MORE THAN 99% OF ALL WIRELESS CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATE IN THAT WE HAVE SYSTEM. IT IS BUILT ON A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL FORWARD LOOKING INVOLUNTARY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS. IT ALSO RELIES UPON THE UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FEMA. THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND LOCAL INNER TO RICH -- ALERT ORIGINATORS WITH A COMMITMENT TO THE CONTINUE COLLABORATION ASSESSMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF WE ENSURING THAT WE ARE REMAINS A TRUSTED SOURCE OF EMERGENCY INFORMATION FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. IS WHEN OF CTA'S HIVE PRIORITIES. WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART TO ENSURE THAT WE IS REMAIN A RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PUBLIC POP PUBLIC SAFETY. WITH THAT IN MIND MY TESTIMONY TODAY ADDRESSES THAT WE HAVE SAID SOME SUCCESS HIGHLIGHTS AND HIGHLIGHTS THE COOPERATIVE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE OPERATE. IN ENCOURAGES THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WE IS INCREASINGLY ENHANCE FEATURES. BY INCORPORATING WE A BEST PRACTICES INTO THEIR EMERGENCY ALERTING PROCEDURES THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. SINCE WE ARE LOST IN TWENTY TWELVE MORE THAN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS HAVE BEEN SENT BY OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS TO SAVE LIVES. THE WE SYSTEM HAS QUICKLY BECOME A CRITICAL RESOURCE FOR THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO RELY ON MOBILE PHONES EVERY DAY. AND NOTABLY WE A MESSAGES SENT DURING RECENT WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. DID HELP PEOPLE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES TO SAFETY. WE ARE MESSAGES OUR TECHS LIKE EMERGENCY ALERT AND WARNING MESSAGES SENT BY NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS CALLED ALERT ORIGINATORS. TO WE A CABLE MOBILE HANDSETS. WE USE UTILIZE A PURPOSE BUILT SELL BROADCAST TECHNOLOGY THAT UNLIKE TEXT MESSAGES OFFERED BY WHITES PROVIDERS LIKE A SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE. OR OTHER OVER THE TOP MESSAGING SERVICES HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DISTRIBUTE A MESSAGE TO AS MANY WIRELESS HANDSETS AS POSSIBLE. USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE CAN BE GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED TWO AREAS CHOSEN BY LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS. ARE TIMELY DELIVERED AND AVOID NETWORK CONGESTION ISSUES. AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL LATER THEME - AUTHORIZES ALERT ORIGINATORS INCLUDING NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS TO SEND WE AS ABOUT IMMINENT THREATS ARE AMBER ALERTS. ALL WIRELESS CONSUMERS WITH WE ARE CAPABLE HANDSETS CAN RECEIVE MESSAGES UNLESS CONSUMERS OPT OUT OF RECEIVING IMMINENT THREAT RAMBLER MESSAGES. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MANY OF THE OTHER LOCAL ALERT -- FUNCTIONS ARE OPT IN WHICH AS HE IS CREATED SOME SOME ISSUES AND THEN LAYERING IT WITH WE IS. IS CLEARLY THE BEST THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED. THROUGH COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY HAS WORKED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS TO ENHANCE WE ARE WITHIN THE CONTOURS OF THE PURPOSE BILL CAPABILITIES. THESE EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN A WITH A SYSTEM THAT ENABLES LOCAL LEARNED ORIGINATORS TO IN BED A LINK TO A WEBSITE AND THIS WAS A MENTION BY -- BY MSTER WHAT'S IN IT AND SOME OF THE EARLIER pTHAT OFFERS CONSUMERS MULTI LINGUAL AND MULTI MEDIA CONTENT AND ENABLES MORE GRANULAR TARGETING BELOW THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR LOCAL LEARNING OFFICIALS CHOSEN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WHILE THIS INDUSTRY IS ALSO WORKING TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS REQUIRED BY THE FCC SUCH AS SUPPORT FOR SPANISH LANGUAGE EXPANDED MESSAGE CONTENT LINKS OFTEN TESTING FOR LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS. AND EVEN MORE GRANULAR GEO TARGETING CAPABILITIES. BUT CONTINUE TO ENHANCE ITS FEATURES LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS ARE INCREASINGLY INCORPORATED THE PROVEN LIFESAVING CAPABILITIES OF WE ARE INTO THEIR EMERGENCY. A LEARNING TOOL KIT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO ENHANCE THE WE ASSISTANCE CAPABILITIES. WE ARE IS A LOCALLY DRIVEN EMERGENCY LEARNING TOOL AND NOT SURE THAT THAT NECESSARILY COME THROUGH WITH OUR CONVERSE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS. WE ARE MESSAGES ARE DEVELOPED TARGETED AND SENT BY THE LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS WHO KNOW BEST HOW TO ADVISE LOCAL RESIDENTS AND VISITORS HOW TO ACT ON INFORMATION ABOUT EMERGENCY. AT A NATIONAL LEVEL WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS ARE PART OF OUR BROADER NATION NATIONAL LEARNING SYSTEM KNOWN AS IPODS MANAGED BY FEMA -- I PAUSE AUTHORIZED FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHO ARE THE ALERT ORIGINATORS TRANSMIT EMERGENCY MESSAGES TO A FEMALE OPERATED SYSTEM. STEVE STEVENS SYSTEM BUT THEN A CASE AND FORMATS THE MESSAGE FOR DISTRIBUTION ACROSS A VARIETY OF CHANNELS INCLUDING THE WITH A SYSTEM. WIRELESS PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE WITH A SYSTEM SEND THE MESSAGES AUTHORIZED BY FEMA TO THE TARGET AREA IDENTIFIED BY THE LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATOR. WITHOUT INPUT INTO THE CONTENT OF MESSAGE BOARD DISCRETION OVER WHETHER OR NOT TO TRANSMIT IT. IS COMPLETELY UP TO THE DISCRETION OF AUTHORIZED FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS TO DO HER TERM IN THE CONTENT OF A WITH A MESSAGE. AND TO INDICATE THE TARGETED GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE LOCAL ALERT ORIGINATORS HAVE ACCESS TO COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM. AND THE TO THE BUT TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE. GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING BELOW THE COUNTY LEVEL AND BETTING LINKS TO THE MULTI MEDIA OR MULTILINK WILL CONTACT. CITY I IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ARE PROUD OF THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT WE A PLACE IN THE NATION'S EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. AND ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS AT EVERY LEVEL TO MAINTAIN SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S HAS WHO FROM ON I AM TO PLEDGE SLATED COUNSEL WITH VERIZON AND BEFORE. BEGAN ON MY PREPARED REMARKS I FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE FIRST RESPONDERS FOR ALL THEY DO -- I THINK WE FAIL TO DO THAT SO FAR TODAY AND AND THEY THEY REALLY HAVE A BIG JOB ON ON THEIR HANDS -- I ALSO WANTED -- TO COLOR FIVE POINT THE PRESIDENT PICKER MADE -- I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU IDENTIFY COMPANIES YOU IDENTIFY THEM CORRECTLY -- AND WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT SERVICE QUALITY ISSUES AND HELP POORLY -- A I'M A PARTICULAR ENTITY WAS PERFORMING -- HE IDENTIFIED THAT ENTITY AS VERIZON FRONTIER -- THAT ENTITIES NOT VERIZON FRONTIER THAT ENTITY IS FRONT HERE -- NOT NOT VERIZON SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO. I WILL -- ALSO STATE THAT -- WITH REGARDS TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE HEARD -- REGARDING REDUNDANCY -- I'VE RECENTLY PARTICIPATED AT THE POND -- EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TASK FORCE -- AND WE DISCUSSED THE ISSUE OF REDUNDANCY -- AND OF THE ISSUE OF SIRENS CAME UP COM AND THERE COULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ADOPTING AND AND IMPLEMENTING A SIREN BASED SYSTEM. NOT ONE SYSTEM IS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THAT WE NEED. TO KEEP IN MIND AND I APPLAUD THE THE CHAIR WOMAN AND HER -- SUPPORT FOR SIRENS AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO DOES -- SO THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WAS THE THE DEVELOPED IN AND OUT SENT AROUND. ESSENTIALLY AND WHAT THE CAR EARLIER PANELS HAVE DISCUSSES THAT -- THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES THAT IMPACTS -- THE ABILITY TO PROPERLY ALERT RESIDENCES THE OUTAGES THAT HAPPENED WITH WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT -- THERE ARE FOR SURE MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THE RELUCTANCE OF SOME OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PUSH ALERTS. TO LARGER GROUPS OF RESIDENTS -- THAT WAS DISCUSSED ALSO IN ONE OF THE PANELS. BUT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT I WANT TO SAY THAT VERIZON -- TO AS EIGHTEEN T. MENTIONING GAUGES AND SIGNIFICANT EMERALD BUST -- DISASTER PREPAREDNESS BY CREATING A RESILIENT NETWORK WE DO HAVE WE DONE THE C. FEATURES THAT INCLUDE RING CONFIGURATION -- WE ALSO -- PROVIDE BATTERY BACKUP AND GENERATOR BACKUP POWER TO VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR MACRO SITES. WHERE LOCAL BUILDING CODES IN SPACE -- SPACING AVAILABILITY ALLOWS IT VERIZON EQUIPS ITS MACRO SITES WITH GENERATORS THAT HAVE -- TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER. THAT CAN BE REVIEW -- FOR MACRO SITES THAT CANNOT HAVE GENERATORS FOR A SLEW OF DIFFERENT REGULATORY OR LEGAL RESTRICTIONS -- WE DEPLOYED BATTERY ARRAYS TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF EIGHT HOURS OF BATTERY. OF THAT BATTERY GETS DEPLETED DURING A POWER SHUT OFF EITHER BECAUSE OF A DISASTER OR BECAUSE IT'S A PROACTIVE -- ONE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO THEN DEPLOYED GENERATORS WE HAVE SUFFICIENT GENERATORS AND IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE A GENERATOR IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY WE ALSO CAN GO TO VENDORS AND AND GET GENERATORS FROM VENDORS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE WERE DISCUSSING THE BATTERY BACK UP AND THERE WAS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER ME INCREASE BATTERY BACKUP -- AT MACRO SITES THAT WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND REMEMBER THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOR TWO YEAR STUDY THE ISSUE OF BACKUP POWER. THE ISSUE DATE THREE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHT PAGE RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT -- AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT THAT THEY HAD CALLED TELCORDIA. AND THAT OUR REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE REALITY IS THAT INCREASING BATTERY CAPACITY IN FUEL SUPPLIES AT NETWORK FACILITIES. WILL NOT PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE RISK DURING MASS OF EVENTS THAT'S A COLD -- SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE COMMISSION FOR OVER A DECADE -- THE THAT STANDARD BUT THAT RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT FOUND THAT IN 2000888% OF CALIFORNIA. CELL SITES HAD BATTERY BACKUP POWER OR BACKUP POWER IN ONE MANNER OR ANOTHER. AND THAT'S A PERCENTAGE THAT ALMOST -- IS SURELY HAS INCREASED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT INEVITABLE THAT COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY DISRUPTED DURING MASSIVE NATURAL. DISASTERS. AND THAT INCREASING BATTERY CAPACITY OR FUEL SUPPLIES. WILL NOT PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN RISK IN THESE MASSIVELY BATHS. THE RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE DESTRUCTIVE NATURE NATURE OF THE DISASTER EVENTS. WILL DEFINITELY RESULT IN LOSS OF COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES NOT JUST WIRELESS FACILITIES. AND GIVEN THAT FINDING IT CONCLUDED THAT RATHER THAN ENHANCE. THE ALREADY EXISTING LEVEL OF NETWORK FACILITIES REDUNDANCY. THE FOCUS FOR RESILIENCY SHOULD BE PLACED. ON ROLL ROLL BUST NETWORK RECOVERY AND RESTORATION PLANS. SO UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUTAGES -- EVEN WITH A BACKUP POWER IN SOME REDUNDANT -- FEATURES SUCH AS RING CONFIGURATIONS -- AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AVERAGES ARE FREQUENTLY NOT CAUSED BY BACKUP POWER DEPLETION. BUT RATHER THE DESTRUCTION OF BACK CALL AND TRANSPORT FACILITIES ON BY OTHER PROVIDERS. VERIZON'S RESPONSE UNNECESSARILY TURNS TO PLANNING FOR TEMPORARY ASSETS AND THE USE OF TEMPORARY ASSETS. SO THIS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE A PAUSE ON IT IS. THAT THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN A MANNER THAT IS COMPLEX -- AND HAS MANY FEATURES AND IN TIRE SORT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IS THAT WAY CELL TOWERS ARE CELL TOWERS BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE BACK CALL THAT BACK HALL IS NOT PROVIDED BY AT LEAST VERIZON DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS OWN BACK CALL. IT LEASES THATFROM OTHER COMPANIES SUCH AS EIGHTEEN T. OR THE CABLE COMPANIES ARE FRONT TIER. AND SUCH WHEN WE'VE WORKS PERRANCE SAID OUT OF OUT AGES -- IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF THE BACK HALL PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF BACKHAUL SO BATTERY BACKUP REALLY WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THOSE SITUATIONS. WHEN THE NEED ARISES VERIZON PROVIDES TEMPORARY ASSETS SWELLING EXPEDITIONS IS IT'S EXPEDITIOUSLY RESTORE SERVICE? WE COLLABORATE CLOSELY WITH FEMA WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICES FIRST RESPONDERS. TO DEPLOY OUR TEMPORARY ASSETS WHERE THEY CAN ACHIEVE. THE GREATEST IMPACT. DISASTER RESPONSE DECISIONS ARE ACTUALLY COMPLEX AND DO DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A FAST TAILORED AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION REALLY IS THE KEY. SO WHEN WE ARE CALLED UPON TO EMERGENCY WE REVIEW THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE BEST PATH FOR ENSURING. THAT APPROPRIATE SERVICE UNDER THOSE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES IS MADE AVAILABLE TO FIRST RESPONDERS. TO PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES AND COMMUNITY. AMONG THE OTHER THINGS TO VERIZON CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM CAREFULLY CONSIDERS TO SITE WERE DEPLOYABLE UNITS WOULD ADDRESS CAPACITY AND SOUND QUALITY ISSUES. AND OR WHETHER ANOTHER SOLUTION IS MORE APPROPRIATE. IN SOME CASES I THINK WE WANT POTS ON THIS AND FOCUS ON THIS A DEPLOYABLE MOBILE WIRELESS UNIT COULD ACTUALLY DEGRADE. THE QUALITY OF SERVICE INSTEAD OF ENHANCING IT. BY INTERFERING WITH SERVICE FROM PERMANENT FACILITIES THAT DO REMAIN OPERATIONAL. A TEMPORARY ACID AS ACTUALLY UNNECESSARY MANY SITUATIONS BECAUSE OF OUR EXISTING NETWORK FACILITIES. THERE EITHER SUFFICIENT OR WE CAN MODIFY THEM ON THE SPOT FASTER THAN ACTUALLY DEPLOYING. A TEMPORARY FACILITY. SO WE WILL MODIFY AND CONFIGURE EXISTING CELL SITES TO ADD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO RESTORE IMPROVE SERVICE. INSTEAD OF MOVING TEMPORARY UNITS TO A TO A PARTICULAR SITE. WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE LABOR AGAIN REQUIRED TO CONFIGURE EXISTING CELL SITES OFTEN ABOUT THE SAME AS THE TIME THAT WOULD TAKE. FOR US TO GET A DEPLOYABLE UNIT UP AND WORKING. AND THIS HAS BEEN HELPFUL SO FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES WE DEPLOYED. TWENTY NINE DEPLOYABLE ASSETS ARE CONFIGURED AND MANY OTHER OF OUR EXISTING CELL SITES. SUCH THAT 97% OF OUR NETWORK WAS OPERATING LIKE NORMAL IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE FIRES. AND 1100% OF THE NETWORK WAS BACK TO NORMAL BY DAY. SEVEN AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE I HAVE MANY EXAMPLES I KNOW WE'RE SHORT ON TIME. BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE BUTTE. CALLIE FIRE THE CAMPFIRE -- WE REPAIRED AS AS THE DAMAGED FIBER WAS BEING REPAIRED. OUR ENGINEERS ADDED CAPACITY -- AT HIM RESTOREDSITES -- TO I HAVE A FIVE DIFFERENT SITES THAT WERE CRITICAL SITES. ARE WE MOVED TO A TEMPORARY NETWORK ASSETS WE HAVEN'T LOOKED ARE CALLED MOBILE COMMUNICATION TRAILERS. TO CAROL YES IS BASE CAMP IN CHICO MUNICIPAL AIRPORT. ALSO AT THE BUTTE FIRE CENTER MEDALLION -- AT PARADISE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND STATION EIGHTY ONE IN PARADISE WE HAD COLDS IN CAL'S IN OTHER WHAT WE CALL FARM ANIMALS SOON -- THAT WE DEPLOYED FOR HELP. WE DID SO TO ALSO WITH THE WORST% WOLSELEY FIRE IN THE LA INVENTOR COUNTIES -- WE GOT OUR ENGINEERS WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO RESTORE SERVICE TO THE IMPACTED AREASAS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE DEPLOYED MOBILE COMMUNICATION TRAILERS ALSO TO STE TO FIRE STATION SEVENTY ONE IN MALIBU SEVENTY TWO MALIBU NINETY NINE IN MALIBU. CAPTURE TEEN IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS A COLD IN OAK PARK THEY CALL TO MALIBU BLUFFS AND POINT DOOM AND EIGHTEEN PORTABLE GENERATORS WERE DEPLOYED. ARE WE PROVIDED ON GOING SUPPORT SO WE DON'T JUST HELP ALL WITH GETTING COMMUNICATIONS BACK UP WE ALSO HELP OUT THE EVACUEES THAT ARE AT SHELTERS OR EVACUATION CENTERS BY PROVIDING INTERNET CONNECTED. LAPTOPS PHONES IN CELL PHONE CHARGING THAT IS A BACK YOU ATION CENTERS. WE WORK WELL WITH CAL -- YES WE WORK WELL WITH LOCAL -- EMERGENCY OFFICES. ARE IN THE THOMAS FIRE FOR EXAMPLE -- WHICH IMPACT OF INSURANCE SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES WITHIN THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT FIRE VERIZON WAS ON THE GROUND TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY. EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE THE MOBILE DEPLOYABLE AS WE DISCUSSED WE STOOD SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. RESPONDERS WE EMBEDDED OUR FOLKS IT AT THE VENTURA COUNTY. EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN CONCLUSION. WE DON'T STOP AND REST ABOUT THIS WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING WAYS TO IMPROVE. ARM INDEED OUR WORK JUST DOESN'T END. WE CONTINUE TO FIND THOSE HUESO FOR EXAMPLE. RISING IS LEADING THE CHARGE RIGHT NOW TO INNOVATE IN THE WAY -- WE CAN FIND YOU USE CASES TO FURTHER SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS AND ENHANCE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TO NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD PARTNER WITH A COMPANY CALLED RESPONDER CORP -- TO LAUNCH AN INCUBATOR PROP PROGRAM DESIGNED TO GIVE START UPS AND OTHER INNOVATORS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP TEST AND REFINE NEW SOLUTIONS. AND FROM THERE WERE GETTING -- A CLASS OF NEW. UP POSSIBILITIES ARE THINGS THAT WOULD USE AUGMENTED REALITIES TO ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS TO SEE IN SMOKE FILLED ZERO VISIBILITY AND HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS -- AND IT GOES ON AND ON SO I WILL STOP THERE BECAUSE I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME. CAROLINE'S YOUR TURN THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HEARING TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY -- WITH SINCE WE HAVE ALL THESE NATURAL DISASTERS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE'S REALLY SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT WHAT. THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS DOING NOT DOING ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. SO I'VE GIVEN THE LATE HOUR TODAY I WANT TO BE VERY FOCUSED IN MY COMMENTS IN TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CABLE INDUSTRY. IS DOING BUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS AND WHERE WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PARTNER. WITH FIRST RESPONDERS THE AND WITH -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FIRST OF ALL STARTING WITH A CABLE NETWORK -- YOU'VE ALL RECEIVED I'M SURE THOSE EMERGENCY ALERTS THAT ARE VERY KNOWING THEY COME OVER YOU'RE TELEVISION THERE OFTEN IS THAT WRITING ON THE SCREEN OR CALL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. AND THEY ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SOMEWHAT ANNOYING NOISE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. THOSE ARE THE FEDERAL ALERTS THAT WE ISSUE PERCENT WENT -- TO A PRESIDENTIAL ORDER. AND THEY ARE GENERALLY USED IN CASES THAT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE DO HAVE AN EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER AN EMERGENCY PLAN. THAT DOES IN FACT INCLUDE A ROLE FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WITH BOTH THE STATE AND WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. SO WE WILL IN FACT ISSUE AN EMERGENCY ALERT BASED ON A DIRECTIVE FROM THE GOVERNOR. THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE SAYS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THOSE ARE DELIVERED OVER THE CABLE NETWORK SIMILAR TO BROADCAST TELEVISION AND RADIO -- I DO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THOSE ALERTS DON'T GO OUT OVER A STREAMING VIDEO SERVICE LIKE A NETFLIX AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT WE CALL CUTTING THE CORD. IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING A SERVICE THAT IS WHAT WE CALL AN OVER THE TOP SERVICE LIKE IN HULU OR NETFLIX. THE A WILL NOT RECEIVE THAT EMERGENCY ALERT. SO -- I WANT TO MOVE IN TIME NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL OR LATE SERVICE. AND I WANT TO START WITH TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERCONNECTED VOIGTS AND NO MATTER VOIGTS. THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT FOR THIS HEARING TODAY. A DISCUSSED VOID AS ONE TECHNOLOGY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. SIXTY INTERCONNECTED VOID ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU A DIRECT CONNECTION TO YOUR HOME. THE FCC DOES IN FACT REQUIRE ALL VOID PROVIDERS TO GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO CALL 911- THE DIFFERENCE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERCONNECTED VOID BUT NO MATTER FLOYD IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE NOMADIC VOIGHT. FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER IT'S LIKE A BONDAGE SURVEYS OR MAGIC JACK SERVICE SO YOU MAY NOT HAVE AN ADDRESS THAT IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE. WHEREAS WITH INTERCONNECTED VOICE WHICH IS THE THE SERVICE THAT'S PROVIDED BY -- MY MEMBERSHIP AT THE ASSOCIATION. WHEN A CALL IS PLACED TO NINE ONE ONE THE INFORMATION THE NAME THE CUSTOMER'S ADDRESS IS IN FACT PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS? I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDING THAT THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT GO TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. FOR INTER CONNECTED V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IT&lt;/c&gt;</u> DOES GO TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. SO IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO DELIVER THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE ALERTS NOW THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS IS THAT A PERSON DOES IN FACT NEED TO REGISTER. THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBER AND THEIR LOCATION WITH THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE ALERT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SIMPLY THE DELIVERY PLATFORM. WE DON'T DETERMINE WHEN THOSE ALERTS ARE ISSUED WITHOUT DETERMINE WHAT THE MESSAGING AS WE SIMPLY DELIVER. THE CALL AS WE ARE ASKED TO DO EITHER DIRECTLY BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT THEY MAY HAVE -- OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM FOR THEM. CUSTOMERS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE AN AIM ADD ADD ALERT VIA EMAIL -- BUT THAT TOO WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO REGISTER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT RECEIVE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS BY EMAIL. SO. I WANT TO MOVE ON NOW AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GUIDELINES THAT -- YES PUT TOGETHER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- THERE'S A FEW AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE ACTUALLY IN NEED OF SOME CLARIFICATION -- THE GUIDELINES WERE ACTUALLY PUT OUT AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO VIEW THAT ONCE THE DRAFT WAS OUT WE DID PROVIDE TO ME M. PUT -- TO YES WE DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS INCORPORATED HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE CLEAR AS TO WHAT THE ROLE OF THE VOID BIZ AND DELIVERING EMERGENCY ALERTS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT COULD BE CLEARER IN THE GUIDELINES -- THERE ARE ALSO PLACES IN THE GUIDELINES WHERE THEY RECOMMEND I AM. TRAINING ON THE CAPABILITIES A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY THEY SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE INTERNET BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT TRAINING SHOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL PLATFORMS THAT MAY BE USED IN THE DELIVERY OF AN EMERGENCY ALERT. SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND -- THE THE CAPABILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE I WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH REGARDS TO THE DELIVERY OF AN EMERGENCY ALERT OVER STREAMING VIDEO SERVICE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND AND THE ISSUING AUTHORITY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT WHEN THEY ISSUE THAT ALERT. THEY SHOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY SHOULD BE TESTING THE SYSTEMS AT A TIME WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT EITHER IS CLEAR. I'M IN THE ALERTS. MOVING TO A GENERALIZATION. SO BECAUSE THE CABLE SYSTEMS RELY ON ELECTRICITY TO OPERATE OR VIDEO OR VOICE IN OUR INTERNET SYSTEMS WE ARE IMPACTED WITH ELECTRICITY GOES OUT WHETHER IT'S DE ENERGIZED INTENTIONALLY OR OTHERWISE. THAT WOULD ALSO IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE ALERTS. TO PREPARE FOR THE LOSS OF POWER THAT CAN IMPACT THE ABILITY TO TRANSMIT EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS CABLE OPERATORS. DO IN FACT COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A BACKUP BATTERY -- THOSE NOTIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED TO THEM UPON THE INITIATION OF SERVICE AND THEY ARE THERE AFTER PROVIDED TO THE KIDS CUSTOMER AT ANNUALLY. THE BATTERY. IS EQUIPPED IN THE BATTERY PROVIDES ENOUGH ENERGY IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE VOICE SERVICE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. FOR EIGHT HOURS OR TWENTY FOUR HOURS DEPENDING ON THE BATTERY CHARLES AND BY BAY CUSTOMER. SO WE ALSO HAVE BACKUP POWER THAT IS MAINTAINED AT KEY CABLE FACILITIES SUCH AS OUR HEAD INS ARE HAVES ARE NOTES. AND WE DEPEND ON THAT BATTERY BACKUP IN ORDER TO KEEP THE NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING THERE MAY BE TIMES WHERE WE ALSO HAVE TO DEPEND ON GENERATORS TO KEEP THE NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING. BUT I WANT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT GENERATORS IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF BECAUSE OF THE WIND. I THINK WE SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT RENTING GENERATORS GAS FIELD GENERATORS. AND THOSE SAME CONDITIONS. I'M YOU DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE THE PROBLEM OR SHIFT THE PROBLEM I SHOULD SAY. FROM A ONE INDUSTRY TO THE OTHER BY REQUIRING THE READING OF GENERATORS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO SUCH. SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE. ADLER'S ADVERSELY IMPACT VARIOUS SERVICES INCLUDING THE PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE NETWORK THAT WE'VE ALL BECOME SO COMFORTABLE WITH VENDOR. WITH BELIEVING THAT IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IF IN FACT THE THE PHONE OPERATES WITH ELECTRICITY AS MANY OF THEM DO THOSE OF US THAT STILL HAVE FONG HOME PHONES PROBABLY HAVE THAT PORTABLE PHONE. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WALK AWAY FROM THE BASE THAT PORTABLE PHONE IS ALSO DEPENDED UPON ELECTRICITY. SO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT FEE POWER GOES OUT ATTY CENTRAL STATION OR REMOTE OFFICE THE LAND LINE IS ALSO GOING TO BE OUT. SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT BACKUP POWER HELPS ENSURE THAT THE MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED. THE EXTENT OF A DISASTER WILL DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT BACK AT POWDER IS EFFICIENT OR WHATEVER THAT WORK HAS BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED IS MAKING AND MAKING AT NON SERVICEABLE AND TELL REPAIRS CAN BE COMPLETED. SO THE GUIDELINES THE YES GUIDELINE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE DISASTER DESTROYED ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIANCE ON OTHER TOOLS FOR EMERGENCY NOTICE? SUCH AS SIRENS AND MEGAPHONES AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE EARLIER TODAY MAY BE NECESSARY. SO THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU. THERE'S A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU MY NAME IS AUGUST GILL I AM THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND FOR SOME BCKGROUND I I SPENT OVER THIRTY SIX YEARS OF THE FIRE SERVICE. RETIRED AS A FIRE CHIEF IN A SPECIAL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND WITHOUT A SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND I WAS GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY COUNTY SDG ANY ABOUT NINETEEN MONTHS AGO AS THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR. IN MY FIRST DAY WAS A P. S. P. S. OF HALF. A SO I I SPUN UP THIS BE RAPIDLY. IN IN THAT I WON THE HISTORY OF OF SDG ANY AND AND AND WHY WE'VE BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN THESE ADVANCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN CENTER YEAH SELECT BECAUSE HE HAD A TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN INDIVIDUAL PS PS ADVANCE. WITH A HUNDRED NINE CIRCUITS DE ENERGIZED. AND BOUGHT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED DURING THAT ETIRE TIME. NOT NOW WHY US SUCH A LOW NUMBERS REALLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE SB GENIES SPENT WELL OVER A DECADE HARD IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT A RELIABLE AND RESILIENT -- LIKE TRIPLE GRAD. AND MAINTAINING THAT AT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL SO IT'S BEEN A VERY PRO ACTIVE STANCE FROM SDG ANY. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM -- DIRECTOR GARLIC DO CHI AND FROM CHIEF PORTER THERE'S NO ONE THING THAT MAKES THINGS WORK PROPERLY IT'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF FACTORS. THAT MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL IN IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OR IN -- THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- PROTOCOLS. ONE OF THEM IS THE RELATIONSHIPS I THINK THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE US UNIQUE OUT THERE -- WE HAVE VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COUNTY -- YES WITH SCALE -- YES WITH ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDER AGENCIES -- WE DRILL WE TRAIN ANNUALLY WITH THEM AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IS DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT DURING THOSE A THIRD OF THOSE TRAINING EXERCISE SO WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WHAT OUR PROTOCOLS ARE. HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO A ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND WE'RE GOING TO RE ENERGIZE TO RETURN BACK TO NORMAL OPERATIONS THERE'S NO SURPRISES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY DURING THIS PROCESS? WE ALSO HAVE A GOOD COMMUNICATIONS PLAN WILL UTILIZE OUR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY ENHANCING THAT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE. A QUICKER MORE APPROPRIATE -- MORE CONFIRMED NOTIFICATIONS TO THE PUBLIC IN TWO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETS THAT ARE OUT THERE THE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF THAT. AND THAT'S WORKING OUT VERY WELL FOR US. ANOTHER PART OF OUR PROTOCOLS HOW WE GO ABOUT ACTUALLY DID DE ENERGIZING WE'RE TRACKING THE WEATHER SEVEN TO TEN DAYS OUT THROUGH OUR MEET OUR STATE OF THE ART MAJOR ALL G. UNIT. AND WITH THAT WE'VE GOT OVER TEN YEARS OF HISTORY OF WEATHER OUT THERE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN WEATHER STATIONS FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD CAMERAS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE SYSTEM. SO WITH THAT TYPE OF OF DECADE LONG -- INFORMATION IN THE DATABASE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A VERY RELEVANT TIMELY APPROPRIATE DECISIONS IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- EVENTS. AND THEN WE GET ABOUT THREE TO SIX DAYS OUT WE'RE STARTING TO FINE TUNE THAT WEATHER EVENT AND START TO SAY. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHAT ARE THE INFRASTRUCTURES THAT MAY GET IMPACTED BY THIS AND WILL START SOME OF THE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE STATE WILL STARTS ON THE OCCASIONS. TO THE COUNTY -- BUT THEM ALREADY RAPID BREATH RATCHETED UP ABOUT TWO TO THREE DAYS OUT BECAUSE NOW WE RUDY GOT A DEFINITIVE LINE ON ON WHAT THIS OF THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE. IN WORKING WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT YEARS AGO IT IS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF A RED FLAG WARNING BE IN ISSUED WHICH STARTS TO LEAD US TOWARDS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF AT AND WITH THAT. WE'LL START TO PUT TOGETHER A VERY FOCUS LIST OF IMPACTED CIRCUITS IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THIS OF BAT AND WILL START TO MAKE THE NOTIFICATIONS. LE AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE PRIMARY METHOD IS -- THROUGH CELLULAR TELEPHONES -- THROUGH THE WIRELESS NETWORK WE MAKE THOSE IN ADVANCE WELL THE ENERGY IS STILL ON SO THEY GET THOSE FIRST NOTIFICATIONS AND THAT WE TRACK THOSE NOTIFICATIONS SO THAT IF THERE IS. A TARGET COMMUNITY A SUCH AS MEDICAL BASS LINE THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON ON ENERGY FOR THEIR DEVICES -- WE WOULD DURING THE EVENT SEND DORA PEOPLE OUT TO KNOCK ON THE DOORS AND VERIFY THAT THEY DID GET THE INFORMATION. THE DAY AHEAD OF THE EVENT WILL START OUR OUR PLAN OUR DEEP PLANNING PROCESS WITH OVER OPERATED UNITS WILL CALL FOR A DAY HAD CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE WE'LL START SETTING UP OVER A LOGISTICS ARE OPERATIONAL PLAN. OUR INCIDENT ACTION PLAN -- WILL MAKE MORE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE STATE THE COUNTY ALL THE FIRST RESPONDER AGENCIES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THIS AND AGAIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE ABOUT ALSO. AND THEN AS WE GET INTO THE DE ENERGIZE ATION WILL BE NOTIFYING THOSE SAME CUSTOMERS AN IMPACTED AREAS. PRIVATE HOPEFULLY UP TO FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO TWO D. ENTERS IS ATION THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND WE DO ALL THIS NOTIFICATION AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS THEME THROUGHOUT HERE THERE IS A THERE IS A A A A DEFINITE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO BE PREPARED. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS THERE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT EVERYBODY THE COULD BE IMPACTED. HAS THE INFORMATION IN ADVANCE TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENT SO THE NOBODY'S CAUGHT SHORT ON THIS. IN THERE DURING THE RESTORATION PROCESS WAS REPORTED ON OUR PLANNING AND YOU KNOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT. WELL ONE OF THE KEY ITEMS ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE -- AS CELLULAR AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY IS RESTORING SERVICE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY LITTLE REACTION TIME. BETWEEN WHEN WE DE ENERGIZED AND THEN WE THEN THE WINDS START TO DIE DOWN WE START TO GO INTO THE INTO THE RE ENERGIZE ATION PROCESS WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE OUR AIR RESOURCES ARE GROUND RESOURCES ARE PATROLLERS. ARE TROUBLE MEN ARE OUT THERE ARE PLANS IN PLACE EVERYBODY'S IN THE RIGHT GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION LOGISTICALLY. AND WE EXPEDITE ONCE THE WINTER DOWN WE'RE SURE AND ONCE WE ONCE WE PATROL IN SURE THAT IT'S SAFE WE RE ENERGIZE IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WE CAN DO THAT PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE SO HIGHLY SEGMENTED OUR CIRCUITS. THAT WE CAN LIMIT TO SMALLER AREAS AND RESTORE THE SMALL AREAS FASTER THAN LARGER YOURSELF WE ONLY HAVE TO IMPACT EIGHT PEOPLE ON A SEGMENTED CIRCUIT VERSUS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED VERSUS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THAT DOES HELP RESTORE THE SERVICE QUICKER. I THINK WHAT REALLY DOES IT FOR US THOUGH IS THE IS THE HANDSHAKE PRIOR TO THE EVENT -- I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THE CITY CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS CAL FIRE AND ALL THE FIRE AGENCIES OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE WORK TOGETHER REGULAR LAST YEAR ALONE WE TRAINED OVER pISSUE WERE DOING ALL THE CHIEF OFFICERS THE DISPATCH CENTERS. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE COMMUNICATE WE KNOW OUR COMMUNICATIONS PLAN. THE FIRST RESPONDERS KNOW THAT COMMUNICATIONS PLANT THE DISPATCHERS BILL THAT COMMUNICATIONS PLAN SO THE WE SEND OUT THAT LIST. OF PROBABLE PS PS IMPACTED AREAS THAT EVERYBODY COMMUNICATES IT THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATIONS AND EVERYBODY'S READY. FOR I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGHLIGHTS IN AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THE OTHER THING WE DO AFTER EACH EVENT IS DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AFTER ACTION REVIEW. WE WANT TO KNOW NOT ONLY WHAT WE DID WELL BUT WHAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND WE GET A LIST OF THAT AFTER THESE EVENTS AND THEN MY STAFF IS RESPONSIBLE TO FACILITATE. A TIMELY COMPLETION OF THE ACTUAL ITEMS AFTER THAT WHICH DRIVE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRESS. PROGRAM POST A MAN. IN PART OF THAT ALSO IS THE CAME OUT OF THAT IS GOING OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES CREE IMPOSED TO MATT AND FINDING OUT HOW IS IT IMPACTING THE COMMUNITIES. HOW DO WE BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH THEM HOW DO WE BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THEN WE FACTOR THAT INTO OUR PROGRAM? ONE OF THE MORE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE AFTER ACTION REVIEW PROCESS IN THE COMMUNITY EVENTS WAS PEOPLE WERE SAYING LISTEN IF FOR THE FIRST ALL. CONNECTIONS DOWN AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET INFORMATION WORK TO WE GO TO GET INFORMATION ON THIS EVENT WORK WE GO TO GET SUPPORT. SO SDG ANY ESTABLISHED ELEVEN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THOSE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IF THOSE ARE. ARE IMPACTED DURING THIS A MAN WILL KNOW WHERE TO GO TO GET THINGS LIKE. CHARGING THEIR CELL PHONES WIRELESS CAN ACTIVITY. GETTING MORE IMPORTANTLY INFORMATION ON THE STATUS THE POSITION AND THE STATUS OF THAT P. S. P. S. ADVANTAGE. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IN THEIR AREA AND AN ESTIMATE FOR ONE THE RESTORATION TIME WILL COME ALONG. WE'LL COME BACK ON SO ALL THAT IS HAPPENING THAT'S AT AT DURING THESE EVENTS. I THINK THAT THAT. WITH ALL THOSE ITEMS FACTORED IN -- THAT'S FOR OUR SUCCESS HAS BEEN WITH THE PS PS AMASSED IN THERE THERE ARE THINGS TO BE DONE WE DO NEED TO RESOLVE HOW HOW DO WE INSURE THE RESILIENCY OF OUR WIRELESS. AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO DEPENDENT WHEN I FIRST CAME ON THE FIRE SERVICE WE DIDN'T HAVE CELLPHONES SO EVERYBODY CARRIED QUARTERS AND YOU HAVE THE THE THE PHONE WITHIN THE HARD LINES. NOW IN IN THE REPORT THAT I READ PRIOR TO THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 53% OF THE POPULATION IS ON CELLULAR CONNECTION SO IT IS THE WAY OF COMMUNICATING NOW AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE WAY OF COMMUNICATING PRIMARILY IN THE FUTURE. DURING THESE EVENTS AND DURING THE FIRE EVENTS THAT THAT DO HAPPEN AND DO OCCUR AS WE SAW OVER THE LAST YEAR [inaudible] TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT TESTIMONY AS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A DAUGHTER LIVING IN SAN DIEGO THAT WAS VERY REASSURING THANK YOU FOR THAT -- MY MY THANKS TO THIS PANEL AND AND YOU KNOW YOU GOT BEAT UP A LITTLE BIT FIRST COUPLE PANELS AND WE ANTICIPATED THAT I HAD SOME SOME GREATEARLY CONVERSATIONS ON WITH SOME OF YOU. AND IN I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE ARE IN ONE OF THOSE UNIQUE WHAT IS TRULY A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION BUT WHAT I HEARD CONSISTENTLY FROM OUR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY. AND AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IS THAT IT'S IT'S GOES SO FAR BEYOND PARTNERSHIP THIS IS REALLY ABOUT DEPENDENCY. WE WE DEPEND ON YOU IN THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THAT YOU PROVIDE IN KEEPING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SAFE AND SO IN PARTICULAR WANTED TO DRILL DOWN KIND OF ON A ON A FEW QUESTIONS ON THINGS YOU YOU. MENTIONED IN PARTICULAR -- IN A GIVEN THAT EIGHT EACH EMERGENCIES IS UNIQUE AND PRESENTS ITS OWN CHALLENGES AND THE FACT THAT WHAT YOU DEAL WITH IN IN DELIVERING YOUR SERVICES IS TRULY CONSUMER MARKET DRIVEN -- WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THE LAST FEW FIRE SEASONS IN TERMS OF -- THE AMOUNT OF MOBILE RESOURCE THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE INTO A COMMUNITY AND AND PROVIDE THAT RESILIENCY PARTICULARLY IF WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE INCIDENTS HAPPENING -- STATEWIDE WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TO DEAL WITH AND AND INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER -- FOR HELP AND SUPPORT WITH YOU KNOW SYSTEM BACK UP. AND THEN AT SOME POINT DOES IT ACTUALLY MAKE MORE SENSE -- TO TO HAVE MORE OF THAT MOBILE CAPABILITY THAN IT DOES -- YOU KNOW GROUND HARDENING LIKE WHICH WHICH OF THOSE TWO OR IS IT SENATE KIND OF SOME COMBINATION OF OF THOSE DEPENDING ON THE AREA THE TERRAIN. THAT THEY CREATE THAT NECESSARY REDUNDANCY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- SO. WHAT WE DIDN'T DISCUSS IS THE FACT THAT -- THE MOBILE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT JUST THE ONES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN BRING OUR RESOURCES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE NATION AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT -- IN THE IN RECENT FIRES WE BROUGHT -- MOBILE -- DEPLOYABLE AS FROM OTHER -- STATES AND WHAT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IT IT'S IT'S FINE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SOMETHING LONG AS WE GET THERE. AND WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP FOR CALLOW YES WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MANY OF THE NOT ALL. THE COUNTY ALL YES AND LOCAL YES SO WHEN WE GO IN THERE AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WE CAN FIGURE OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHERE THERE IS A SPECIFIC NEED. AND THEN DECIDE WHAT THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT IS AND DEPLOYABLE IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN DO. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ALREADY HAVE CELL SITES UP THERE THAT MAY BE MODIFIED TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND WE'VE DONE THAT MANY TIMES OR WE'VE INCREASED PASSIVE EXISTING. CELL SITES TO DEAL WITH THE AND THE THE FACT THAT MAYBE ANOTHER CELL SITE HAS GONE DOWN BECAUSE FIBER HAS BEEN CUT OR FOR ANOTHER REASON. SO -- SO. WHAT WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UPON THOSE COMMUNICATIONS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE? YOU KNOW -- NOT TALKING PAST EACH OTHER AND AND WE DON'T FIND THAT. BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ DOUBLE THOSE EFFORTS -- WITH REGARDS -- TO THE OTHER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND HOW WE WORK WITH THEM -- WE DO PRETTY GOOD ACTUALLY -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE KNOW THAT WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS WE HAVE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER -- WE HAVE -- THE ABILITY SORT FOUR NINE ONE ONE CALLS -- TO GO TO A COMPATIBLE NETWORK IF OUR NETWORK IS DOWN AND VICE VERSA -- SO A PERSON AND IS ON A VERIZON -- COMMUNICATIONS PLAN AND THERE IS AN OUTAGE -- TEMPORARY OUTAGE THEY CAN DIAL 911- AND WHATEVER OTHER COMUNICATIONS COMPANY IS UP TO HAVE COMPATIBLE EQUIPMENT WILL TAKE THAT NINE ONE ONE CALL. I'LL JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT -- NICE TO THANK YOU THAT REALLY. AS YOU SAID AT THE IT'S A VARIABLE THERE IS NO ONE SOLUTION TO THE QUESTION -- SO OVER THE OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS IS THAT WE DO INCREASE HARDENING OF AREAS WHERE WE CAN WIFE WE CAN PUT A A PERMIT GENERATOR AND WE WILL. NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION WE'VE ADDED HUNDREDS OF PORTABLE GENERATORS TO OUR OUR FLEET AND WE DEPLOY THOSE AND WE HAVE THE STAGE IN AREAS THAT ARE BEST SET FOR THAT. WE PARTNER WITH OUR OTHER CARRIERS IN IN THE EVENT WE NEED. TWO AGAIN PERSONALLY IS THE COORDINATOR FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY OPERATIONS. WE HAVE DURING THE CAMPFIRE SPECIFICALLY I MEAN I REMEMBER WORKING WITH RISE AND I WAS SPECIFICALLY TO GET CUSTOMERS BACK ON LINE AND GET CALLS THROUGH BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. BUT THERE IS A ONE SOLUTION RIGHT BUILDING RESILIENT NETWORK BUILDING REDUNDANCY AND HAVING A A FIRST RATE. RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE THE BEST SOLUTION AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THE ALERTS ON TOP OF THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MIXED BAG THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE BEST. RESPONSE. ARE THERE ANY CURRENT REGULATORY CHALLENGES THAT. PREVENT YOU. OPTIMALLY DOING THIS SYSTEM RESILIENCY RIGHT NOW IS THERE ANYTHING THE STATE IS DOING THAT GETTING IN THE WAY OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE TO KEEP. RESIDENTS SAFE [inaudible] THE I WOULDN'T THINK SO I I I ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT -- THE THE DATE AND I REALLY APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT MADAM CHAIR -- BOOK BUT WE SPOKE BEFORE THE HEARING AGAIN WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT COLLABORATION -- I THINK COLLAB IT ANYTHING IN THIS AREA CAN BE BETTER I THINK COLLABORATION TO BE BETTER -- AND SO I FROM THE STATE SIDE I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US TALKING. WITH EACH OTHER. RATHER THAN THAT EACH OTHER WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I THINK HAPPENED TODAY -- BUT SO WE'RE HOPEFUL MAYBE USING YOUR GOOD OFFICES THERE'S THERE'S A AND AND AND THE VICE CHAIR WHO'S BEEN A HE WAS BEEN A REAL LEADER IN THIS AREA -- TO START THE TO DO BETTER AT TALKING BEFORE THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND ADDS. AND WHAT WE CAN WHAT WECAN DO BETTER ONE OF THE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY -- WAS -- IN THE RURAL AREAS. IT'S NOT SO MUCH A STATE ISSUE IT'S SORT OF A LOCAL ISSUE. PROBABLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ORE SITES IN CERTAIN PLACES THAT ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DO. A IN SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE AREAS LIKE THAT. PUBLIC LANDS AND AND SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS OF REALLY HARD. TO THE SITE TO SITE INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT IF I CAN ADD -- AS AS HE WAS TALKING IDEAS ACTUALLY FLOWED SO -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR FACILITIES -- IN IN PLACES WHERE THE A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCESS SEEN IS COMPLICATED THAT THAT'S A LOCAL ISSUE ISSUE IT'S NOT A STATE ISSUE BUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET THE PERMITS FOR A MACRO TOWER -- OR OTHER WIRELESS FACILITY SOMETIMES CAN BE TWO THREE YEARS MAYBE EVEN LONGER -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE COMMUNITY OPPOSITION AND YOU HAVE AN M. P. ISM NOT IN MY BACKYARD -- THEN DID THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE TYPE OF REDUNDANCIES THAT WE WANT TO OUR MORE ROBUST COMMUNICATIONS -- NETWORK -- THIS IS SOMETHING ALL OF US EXPERIENCE AND Là ARE GIVE YOU. ONE EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE IN IT AND IT DOESN'T REALLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO STAY CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT NO ONE WE WANT TO PUT UP A MACRO -- WE NEED TO GO FIND A LOCATION TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE A LEASE WITH THE LANDOWNER TO DO THAT AND THEN GET THE PERMITTING THEN CONSTRUCTED -- WE HAVE DELAYS BECAUSE SOME LANDOWNERS WILL ENTER CONTRACTS WITH US AND THEN BACK OUT -- YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS LATER SO THAT ADDS TO THE TIMING. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THAT I CAN DISCUSS HERE -- IN TERMS OF SORT OF THE REGULATORY. AT THE SIR LIMITATIONS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC. ARE THE AIR QUALITY OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S SO AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S HAVE A LOT OF LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON HOW LONG YOU CAN. I HAVE A GENERATOR RUN -- EVEN TO TEST THEM -- IF YOU WANT TESTER GENERATORS WHICH WE HAVE TO DO ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THERE'S LIKE VERY EXTREME LIMITATIONS ON WHEN WE CAN DO THAT. BUT THIS IS THE CLINCHER IS EVEN DURING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OF THE DISASTER. AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S RESTRICT RESTRICTS US TO TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF GENERATOR -- USE. SO IF IT IF IT'S A VERY LENGTHY -- DISASTER AND WE WANT TO REFUEL OUR GENERATORS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WANT OUR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE SERVICE AND FIRST RESPONDERS TO HAVE SERVICE. WE'RE WE'RE OUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT RESTRICTION AND THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH THAT IS YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN OFF YOUR SYSTEMS YOU JUST GO FORTH AND YOU GET PENALTIES YOU GET PENALIZED PRETTY SEVERELY. THEY'RE IN THE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO APPLY FOR AN EMERGENCY WAIVER -- WITH AQ AND A NOT THAT I KNOW OF THANK YOU I'M AT THIS TIME AND LOVE TO WELCOME MY VICE CHAIR SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. THANK YOU I'M OF MY APOLOGIES WE SPENT TWO HOURS DISCUSSING THE WILDFIRE BILL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S JUST ON BECAUSE OF ALL THE WILD FIRES WE'VE HAD THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE TO THE STATE. TO MY COMMUNITY I THINK PERHAPS TO THE CHAIRS COMMUNITY AND MANY OF US HERE HAVING. SUFFERED THE RAVAGES OF WILDFIRES AND THEN IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAD A AS ASTROS. FLOOD DEBRIS FLOW WE CALLED IT THAT KILLED TWENTY THREE PEOPLE WERE SLEEP IN THEIR BEDS AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AFTER FIRE SO -- AND NOW WE HAVE PEACH TREE IN A AN EDISON AND SDG ANY HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVES THAT THE PREVENTION IS ALWAYS WORTH AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE AND I'M. CONCERNED VERY CONCERNED THAT WE ARE -- HAVING SOME. I THINK IT YOU SAY TALKING. BY EACH OTHER. AND OUR LIVES ARE AT STAKE WE ARE NOW BY TEN OR NEXT FIRE SEASON. THANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE THINGS ARE BURNING HARDER FASTER MORE INTENSELY -- MORE RAPIDLY SO -- FIREWOOD. I APOLOGIZE THAT I MISSED A GOOD PORTION THIS BUT I DO I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT. TO PASS MISS MCINTYRE HOW IT FEELS TO BE THE ONLY WOMAN ON ANY THESE PANELS TODAY. WE REALLY DO NEED TO BRING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT. TO PERSPECTIVE TO THE TABLE -- BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE IS SIGN AND I NOTICE YOU'RE WEARING WHITE YOU'RE THE PERSON IN THE WHITE HAT HAS IT WORK -- BUT I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE ALERT SYSTEM THE AND I THINK IT WAS FAIRLY WELL COVERED. IN THE IT VANCE PAPERS THAT WERE DONE HERE SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GET RIGHT TO THE CHASE FOR TRUST A COUPLE MINUTES BECAUSE I REALIZE IT'S LATE AND WE HAVE PUBLIC. COMMENT COMING AS WELL. INDEED THE CHAIR LEAVE THIS YEAR APPOINTMENTS OKAY SO. THAT'S A THAT'S A YEAH A HINT THAT WE SHOULD BE WINDING DOWN -- ON THE ON THE REDUNDANCY OF OUR ALERT SYSTEMS -- IT WAS SO I THINK TWO YEARS AGO -- IN DECEMBER WHERE -- WE HAD A HEARING IN THIS ROOM VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATIONS AND WE HAD HAD THE FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE KILLED I THINK THIS FORTY FOUR PEOPLE. OF THE CAR FIRE IN IN IN THE COFFEE PARK IN SANTA ROSA AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE. UNNECESSARY JOB IN WARNING PEOPLE BECAUSE THE FIRST OUR FIRST PRIORITY NOT TRUSTED IN. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT FOR YOU FOLKS WHO ARE THE ONES WHO PROVIDE THESE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND DO THE WORK TO COORDINATE NIGHT. AND I DO AGREE THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRITICAL IN COORDINATING EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT BUT YOU'RE THE FOLKS OUT THERE WHO HAVE THOUGH THE HARDWARE -- THE FOLKS THAT DO THE ALERTS AND MOST PEOPLE I KNOW TODAY DO NOT HAVE LAND LINES. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY. AND TO BRING IN MOBILE UNITS IS GREAT BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T COME IN BEFORE THE FIRE STARTS RAVAGING THROUGH A COMMUNITY YOU MIGHT GET A MINUTE DAY OR TWO LATER. BUT WHEN THAT FIRE STARTS. AND AN HOUR AND A HALF LEFT AFTER A BANG DOWN THAT GAVELED TO DISCUSSES ISSUES DECEMBER FOURTH AND I REMEMBER SAYING WELSH DECEMBER HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT. LITERALLY AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED. AND IN MY DISTRICT EVERY OUNCE OF THAT FIRE. FORTY DAYS SAID FIRE BURNED AND IT MOVED ACROSS. THE COMMUNITY ACROSS VENTURA COUNTY AND IT ENDED UP BEING PUSHED INTO THE BACK COUNTRY ONE MILE FROM MY HOUSE. SO I HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AS WELL AS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS FROM WORKING WITH -- YES IT DID AN AMAZING JOB AND AND ALL THE OTHER GROUPS WHO CAME TOGETHER. BUT OUR ALERT SYSTEM IS NOT ADEQUATE. AND WE KNOW WHEN THESE FIRE START. UP IN THE HILLS AS MOST OF THEM DO. IT IS A IT IS A A A TELEPHONE POLE. THAT FALLS TO THE WINDOW OR CAPTURES ON FIRE AND THEN EVERYTHING RACES FROM THERE AND ON THOSE POLLS ARE FREQUENTLY WIRELESS EQUIPMENT SO THE WIRELESS SYSTEM GOES DOWN SO THE QUESTION BECOMES. HOW OUR PEOPLE IF THE ELECTRICITY SO IF THE WIRELESS SYSTEM GOES OUT HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO MOVE THEY NEED TO LEAVE THEY NEED TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY? AND SO -- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE MOBILE UNITS TO COME IN A DAY OR TWO LATER. WHAT IS IT THAT THE WIRELESS COMPANIES ARE DOING ARE PREPARED TO DO? IN ORDER TO HELP YOU KNOW YOU WE ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS. THE THESE COMPANIES MAKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BY SERVING THE CUSTOMERS THE PEOPLE THE STATE AND WHEN IT COMES TO IN A DISASTER WE NEED TO THEIR SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING. WHAT DO YOU NEED US TO DO TO HELP YOU SO THAT YOU CAN HARDEN AT INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE REDUNDANCIES? THAT WE NEED SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE WI IS SYSTEM IS OPERATING OR OTHER SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING AND I'VE DONE LEGISLATION ON THIS SIDE A BILL THIS YEAR THAT. THAT -- WAS -- HELD UP ON THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BECAUSE WIRELESS COMPANIES DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO. SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO HELP US PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE [inaudible] WELL THAT. IF I UNDERSTAND YOU FEEL VERY STRONGLY AS TO EVERYBODY ELSE HERE CENTER JACKSON -- WELL THAT ISN'T EVEN THE NINETY PLUS PEOPLE WE LOST IN PARADISE SO WELL. THE WITH A SYSTEM -- PAN AND I UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF IT THERE'S A CHICKEN AND EGG THING HERE BUT A LOT OF TIMES -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE OUIJA SYSTEM IS USED IN A TIMELY ENOUGH FASHION BEFORE THINGS GO DOWN WE THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW WITH A LOCAL ORIGINATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT'S UP TO LOCAL ORIGINATORS. TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO DO A OF WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT -- THEY DETERMINE THE MESSAGE. THEY DETERMINE THE AREA. AND THEN. WE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE TOLD. SO SOME TIME AND SO WETHINK THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE TO DO IS WORK COLLECTIVELY TO MAKE SURE AND MORE LOCAL ORIGINATORS WHICH ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE pIT AND UNDERSTAND THE TIMELINESS OF IT OBVIOUSLY IF. ENTIRE NETWORK GOES DOWN. YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I THINK THE CARRIERS ARE ALSO DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT JUST BECAUSE ONE SIDE GOES DOWN DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T RE DIRECT TRAFFIC YOU KNOW ELSEWHERE -- I DO THINK THE COMPANIES ARE DOING IT AT A VERY GOOD JOB AND YOU DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T HEAR MISTER MISTER WATSON SO -- TESTIMONY ABOUT. THE THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN ANTICIPATION OF I MEAN. YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT'S COMING RIGHT I MEAN THAT ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THEY HAPPEN VERY VERY QUICKLY [inaudible] SO. COLLABORATING WITH WITH -- YES -- WITH LOCAL ORIGINATORS -- IN IN IT AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK. TO TO SEE HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE BUT I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IS ALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT TO MAKE IT BETTER WELL I'M INTERESTED IN THAT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T GO BACKWARDS BUT IF YOU WOULD. ADDRESS THE QUESTION. YOU HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE ON TELEPHONE POLES IN RURAL AREAS OR IN THE HILLS -- SUBJECT TO ENORMOUS WINS SUBJECT TO COLLAPSING AND IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE EVERYTHING GOES OUT. SO -- GRANTED YOU CAN YOU CAN -- WE HAVE LOCAL ORIGINATORS TO DETERMINE THE MESSAGE AN AREA BUT IF THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER IT IT DOESN'T MATTER SO WE CAN WORK ON AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT LOCALLY -- I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DIFFERENT WARNING SYSTEMS THAT ARE DELIVERED THROUGH WIRELESS I GOT WANTED TO THIRTY IN THE WARM MORNING FROM WE HAD DURING OUR FIRE DID KNOW QUITE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AND TURNED OUT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT EVERY TEN MILES. AWAY SO DIDN'T HELP VERY MUCH THERE HAVE TO BE A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND BECAUSE WIRELESS NOW IT IS TODAY THE PRIMERA WAY THAT PEOPLE COMMUNICATE. OR BY INTERNET TO WHICH MANY OF WHICH ARE YOU KNOW DONE THROUGH WIRES AND CABLES AND ALL. WHAT IS IT? THAT THAT YOU MAY NEED OR THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO -- WE WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE LOCALS AND SAY YOU GOT A MOVE FASTER THEY CAN'T MOVE FASTER IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THERE THAT'S YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT CAN WE DO GOING FORWARD? TO ASSIST YOU IN ASSURING THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE AND IT'S FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO BE FUNCTIONAL. AND IT'S RIGHT UP THERE USUALLY IN THE IN THE RISKIEST AREAS -- BUT IT'S GOT TO WORK. WHEN PEOPLE DIE OR THEY ARE TRAUMATIZED BY THIS -- THIS EXPERIENCE IT DOESN'T HELP TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM WENT OUT IT WAS UP IN THE HILLS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH STUFF IS. THE STUFF ON TELEPHONE POLES ARE GENERALLY THE MICRO THE TINY LITTLE THINGS BUT MOST OF THE WIRELESS NETWORK IS ON THE MACRO TOWERS CORRECT TODD FINE AND WHERE THE MACRO TOWERS. I'M SORRY WHERE ARE THE MAC FORGET WHERE THEY LOCATED ORDER THE LARGER STILL TOWERS THAT YOU'D SEE GENERALLY THROUGHOUT THE AREA SO THEY'RE NOT GENERALLY PLACED ON TELEPHONE POLES THE MACRO SIDE SORRY FINE BUT THEY ARE IN THE HILLS SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE USUALLY. BUT THEY ARE A WE HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THOSE WE HAVE RESILIENCY IN REDUNDANCY IN THE NETWORK AS WELL WITH BACKUP OF POWER SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE MACROS FOR ALL MICROSITES. IN IN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HAD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S CORRECT OUR MACRO SITES ALL HAVE REDUNDANT POWER -- SOME REMARKS WHICH HAVE REDUNDANT POWER. AND WHEN YOU SAY MACROS SITES FOR THOSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS IS A LARGE POLLS YOU'D SEE WITH IS WITH THE TOWERS ON TOP OF THE NOT -- SMALLER SO WE CALL MICROSITES WOULD BE ON A TELEPHONE POLE OF FOR THE NEXT NEXT GEN TYPE OF CELL SERVICE BUT THE MACRO SIDES OF THE MAIN ONES YOU'D SEE THROUGH SO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT OU NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM -- BUT I'D SAY IS THAT WE WE'VE BUILT A NETWORK WITH MANY LEVELS OF DIVERSITY CONTINUE LOOKING OF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES CLEARLY BASED ON THE EVIDENCE WEEKS WE'VE HEARD TODAY RIGHT -- BUT WE CAN'T WE WE DECIDED TO STAND MULTIPLE POINTS OF FAILURE BUT WE CAN'T DESIGN A NETWORK THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THE ENGINEER NETWORK. WITH INSURANCE THAT WILL NOT BURKE. FOR INSTANCE IN THE CAMPFIRE WITH MARK FIRE MOVES SO FAST AND SO QUICKLY IT IMPACTED BOTH ARE DONE THE LINES IN THE AREA. SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS WE COULD GET A SATELLITE COLD IN THERE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN ACCESS THE AREA WHICH RESTORED SERVICES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO I AM AND WHAT I WOULD ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT AN EASY ANSWER AND I I THINK I SENT IT TO THE CHAIR THERE -- THERE IS NO SINGLE LEARNING SOLUTION FOR ALL SCENARIOS. WOULD RATHER SEE A SUITE OF SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO EMLOY RIGHT INCLUDING WE ARE -- WHAT'S THE KHôNG RIVERSIDE ONE ONE TV AND RADIO AND EVEN OFTEN MOBILE ALERTS. AND WHILE WE DON'T MANAGE THE SOLUTIONS WE DO BUILD A STRONG AND RESILIENT NETWORKS THAT CAN DELIVER THEM. AND THAT'S THAT'S OUR GOAL. WELL I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS ON THIS -- APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE THIS WEEK WE JUST CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH WHERE WE ARE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW MORE DISASTERS THE COMMON I WILL TELL YOU. UP FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WHO SPENT FORTY DAYS WONDERING WHETHER THIS FIRE WAS GOING TO TAKE OUT THE ENTIRE CITY SANTA BARBARA WHICH WAS A POSSIBILITY. OF THE ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW ARE STILL EXPERIENCING TO THIS VERY DAY. SO WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE WE'VE GOT TO DO IT BETTER. AND WE NEED TO TO BE PARTICIPATING WITH US SO I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND HOPE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS WELL. SO WITH THAT I I THANK YOU ANY OTHER I GUESS IT'S JUST ME MYSELF AND ME -- SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE IN THE AND THIS WILL CONTINUE AND I THINK NOW WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP. FOR YES YES WE'RE GONNA PEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE COULD HAVE SOME PEOPLE IF YOU HAD IF THERE IS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU COULD -- PERHAPS TWO TO THREE MINUTES SIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I AM DAVE SHELF Là VICE PRESIDENT SHALL RIGHT CORPORATION DOWN IN SAN DIEGO WE MAKE -- STATE OF THE ART MASSIVE CATION SPEAKERS AND LOCATION BASED -- ALERTING SOFTWARE -- I WE WERE I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO HEAR MULTIPLE WITNESSES TALK ABOUT. THE NEED FOR REDUNDANCY THE READ THEY NEED FOR A MULTI LAYERED APPROACH THAT THERE'S NOT ONE SOLUTION TO ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS -- I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD ONE THING AT THE END HERE AND THAT IS. WITHOUT A COUPLE OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA STEP FORWARD AND ADOPT OUR MULTILAYER SOLUTION MILL VALLEY LAGUNA BEACH IN PARTICULAR. BOTH OF THOSE ARE COMMUNITIES EARLY ADOPTERS OF THIS APPROACH -- THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PROTECT THEIR SEVEN CERNER CITIZENRY. I ALSO HAVE RESOURCES A LOT OF COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE SO I WOULD SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS OF SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WHETHER THAT'S DIRECT FUNDING FROM LEGISLATURE OR WHETHER IT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF FUNDED GRANT PROGRAMS IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT THESE IDEAS IN THIS APPROACH BE -- EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE. TURNING ONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO STEP FORWARD. PART SEEING NONE. LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY TO ADJOURN I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE GAVEL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE RICHARD
