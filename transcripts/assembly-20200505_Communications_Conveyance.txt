AT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ONE IN FIVE. AMERICAN ADULTS EXPERIENCE HUNGER. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE CALIBRATION PROGRAM INCREASED ITS APPLICATIONS LIKE OVER 2100% IN THAT FIRST TWO WEEK PERIOD OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE WILL NOW THAT ACCESS TO PHONE AND INTERNET IS ESSENTIAL DURING THE CALL. BUT NOT ONLY THAT BEYOND THE COMBAT GREAT FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE LIFELINE PROGRAM IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT EXISTS TO PROTECT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH TOO MANY CASES SERVICES AND TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT THEY AND THAT THE PORTABLE AND DOESN'T FORCE THEM TO MAKE THAT DECISION BETWEEN FOOD. AND HOUSE. EDUCATION THIS PROGRAM CHRIS QUICKLY RAMPED UP WHEN AT THE SERVICES ARE NEEDED ANSWERS TO PUT TOGETHER ADDITIONAL SERVICES WINDOWS ARE APPROPRIATE TO HELP AT THE HOUSEHOLD TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM AND TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM. WITHOUT ACCESS TO. EDUCATION EITHER BY PHONE FAX OR INTERNET LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WILL NOT ONLY STRUGGLED THROUGHOUT THE COLOR CRISIS WHICH WE EXPECT WILL HAVE IMPACT ON OUR NEED TO- MODERATE PEOPLE AT ACTIVITIES INCOME FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS AHEAD.

LEAVING GIVEN ALL FACILITY IS PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IDEAS AND HOW THEY ARE A CHALLENGE TO GET THEM AS THE DMB IS CLOSER HAVE LIMITED SERVICE. I KNOW I PERSONALLY HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE LIFELINE PROGRAM- WHEN I HAD AN UNCLE WHO IS HOME LIFE AND IN ORDER TO HELP HIM. BECOME CLEAN AND GET HEALTHY AND BE CONNECTED TO THE FAMILY. AS DURING A REALLY HARD TIME IN HIS LIFE THE LIFELINE PROGRAM HELPED US TO DO THAT. ONLY BELIEVE IN THIS PROGRAM. A MODEL OF- OF WHAT GOOD GOVERNMENT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT WE CAN DO.

AS CONSUMER PROTECTION ORGANIZATION A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ADVOCATING FOR. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TURNED OUT SUPPORT YOUR OVERALL WALDRON CRISTINA FORMAT AND PARTICIPATION. PROGRAM IN FACT TURN HAS WORKED HEAVILY FOCUSED COMMUNITY LEVEL AT. THE LEGISLATURE. THE END OF FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN SHE THIS PROBE IS AVAILABLE THIS POP. FORTUNATELY THE BILL CURRENTLY DROUGHT AND A LIGHT OF CURRENT PROCEEDINGS THAT THE CPC TURN IN THE POST TO- TO THE BILL. I WE HAVE YEP. TO THE AUTHOR AND SHARE HIS OVERALL GOAL I WE HAVE WORK CALLED YASIR OVER THE YEARS AND EXPECTED CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE NOT WHO STARTED TO RUB YOU BUT IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER WE MEMBERS. HERE YOU. LOW IS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS TURN IT DOWN BI POLAR. INTERRUPTING OKAY. NO NO PROBLEM- THE METER TO THE FIRST PROVISIONAL BALLOTS BALLS PROBLEMATIC FOR US AND THAT IS PREVENTION RELATED TO BE A PART FOR YOU- WE DO NOT SUPPORT. HE PROPOSED SIX MONTHS OR THIRTY THREE- DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST LOW INCOME CONSUMERS TO BE LOCKED CARRIER EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AND BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THE ADOPTED. A SHORTER. AT LEAST FOR THAT ACT THE LAND ON THE FOUR HOUR PERIOD FINDING LONGER PERIOD WITHIN THEIR COUPLE. PASSED IN. ABOUT COME CUSTOMER WE SEE NO REASON RIGHT NOW TO GO BEYOND THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD OF. IT TO MAKE IT A MY PORTABILITY STREETS AND- THEN BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE THIS IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION. SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE OPPOSE THE BILL. BALANCE OF THE BILL I TURN UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TIMES THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. TO ACCELERATE THE TIMELINE TO THE CPSC. HOWEVER WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE COMMISSION IT RECENTLY INTIATE A PROCEEDING TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS YOUR MOMENT ISSUE I ONE. TURN AND OTHERS PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS AND IT'S BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE. AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE SOME VERY GOOD OUT. OF ACTUALLY THIS WOULD DICTATE SOME OF THE OUTCOME AND THAT'S CONCERNING DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THAT BUT- FOR THE COMMISSION STAKEHOLDER TO DEVELOP. PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND THIS GOES IT WILL TRY TO HAND OF THE OF THE COMMISSION. AND OF ALL OF WORKING ON IT THE MOST HELPFUL SOLUTION POSSIBLE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU AND IF WE HAVE MISS PAMELA LOOMIS IS PAMELA LOOM AS I APOLOGIZE FOR COULD BE PLUGGED INTO THE CALL PLEASE. YES FAMILIES ON HER LINES OPEN AND PLEASE SPEAK LOUD AND CLEAR. RIGHT I GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHAL OF MY CLIENT CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S COMMITMENT TO THE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO THE LIFELINE PROGRAM IT IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY NET THAT WE FULLY EMBRACED AND SUPPORT. HOWEVER WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE RESURRECTION OF THE PORTABILITY THREES OF ANY BLANKS BEYOND THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS ESTABLISHED BY THE PC. NOT LONG AFTER ADOPTING A PORTABILITY FREE THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ELIMINATED IT BECAUSE THE FCC FOUND THAT THAT THE PORTABILITY FREEZE DISADVANTAGE CONSUMERS. BY RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO EITHER CHANGE CARRIERS OR TO GET THEIR LIFELINE BENEFITS. THEY'RE FIVE THEREBY MAKING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF TRACKING THE PORTABILITY FREEZE UNSUPPORTABLE. THE P. YOU SEE AGREED WITH THE FCC AND FOLLOWED SUIT. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT AB THIRTY SEVENTY NINE WOULD MISALIGNED THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM WITH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. BY ALLOWING FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION AND PROGRAM BASED QUALIFICATION NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE FCC. WE CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH BUT HARMONIZING THE STATE LIFELINE PROGRAM WITH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM REDUCES CONFUSION FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. AND EVEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA'S LIFELINE ADMINISTRATOR AND CARRIERS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO UNLESS EIGHTY THIRTY SEVENTY NINE IT'S AMENDED TO ALIGN WITH THE FEDERAL LIFELINE PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU UNLESS MR OF BUCKET ON WAS ON THE PHONE AND CAN GET PLUGGED IN I ASKED THE CHAIR IF I COULD JUST CONTINUE I'M SORRY THAT'S THE- AUTHOR OF I CAN JUST CONTINUE. IT KIND OF LOOK AROUND- BUT AFTERNOON THANK YOU AB GIVE CLEARLY INTO THE MICROPHONE AND LOUD. MY NAME IS CARLOS LOOKING ON ALL I UNDERTAKE YOUR DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL MISSING ACOSTA A MEDAL OF CRITICAL TO TRY- NEWSSTAND THIRTEEN.

SO I THINK YOU FOR GOVERNMENT TO REALLY SET THE SACRAMENTO- TO HELP PROVIDE RELIEF AND RECOVERY. I CALLED TODAY TO RESPECT REQUIRES YOU TO VOTE FOUR EIGHT THREE THREE SEVEN NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER A LOT OF THE WORK VIA. A BILL THAT TRIED TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF THE MUCH NEEDED CALIFORNIA LAST. LIFELINE PROGRAM. IF WE PUT. NOT ALLOWED LIKE BOEING HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO MANY OF OUR OUT OF WORK OUT OF EIGHT ANON CONNECT THE COGNITIVE THEM OUT. I HAVE WORKED INCREASED PARTICIPATION THIS PHONE IN THE POT. I HAVE SEEN MANY TEACHERS FOR EXAMPLE PROBABLY. BUT TO RE ENROLL IT WAS LONG AND THEY GET IT BAKER BROKE ON IT THE- ARE THEY HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE CITY IS FILLED UP THERE ON THE STAND THE LEGAL COMMUNITY. WHEN I WAS THE SOLID STRENGTHENING GREASE AND ROAMING ABOUT FLYING IF YOU USE. IF YOU SEE DOLLARS TO BE A PART OF THE PROCEEDING. AND I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE KIND OF MONEY AND TIME FOR THE- RIGHT NOW UP TO THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO ROLE OF MANY LOW EQUAL PROMISE OF POSSIBLE. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM WHAT THEY ARE UP ON. WE HOPE THAT THE BILL WOULD HELP BUT THE GRIEF OF WHICH- VIEWS LOW INCOME FAMILIES NEED TO CONFIRM- THAT THEY ARE YOU. I'M GOOD BENEFITS SUCH A THING HAND BROKE BROKE DOWN. I HAVE YOU. FOR A NIGHT WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FIVE MR GARCIA THANK YOU FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROVISION OF THE BILL RELATED TO- EXTENDING LIFE BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTION SO YOUR GOOGLE. ASKS THE PUBLIC UTILITY COULD IN ISSUE FOR. THE NEXT- I BELIEVE IT'S- COUPLE OF YEARS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A LIFELINE SUBSCRIBER.

ALSO BE A IN THE CREASE IN THE SURCHARGE- TOOLS- HELPFUL. LINE WITH THAT BEING SAID- THAT'S THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE BECAUSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS ARE HAPPENING AT THE SCENE YOU SEE.

ON WERE PROVINCIAL PHONE SERVICE COULD POTENTIALLY WHAT'S ONE REMIND PEOPLE WERE STILL BE TALKING TO CHAIR. INSURE THAT WE CONDUCT BUSINESS NORMALLY. FEDERAL OKAY I KIND OF HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE- IN MY OPINION IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A BROADBAND AND LIFELINE PROGRAM YOU SHOULD THROUGH SURCHARGE ON INTERNET SERVICE NOT SURCHARGES ON RESIDENT PHONE SERVICE- ERR ESSENTIALLY WE'VE GOT A SHOT CONSUMER THAT EVEN BY READ. SERVE AND I'M NOT SURE WOULD BE THROUGH SURCHARGES PHONE SERVICE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AT SERVICE HI BUT IN A IN A BROADER SENSE I THINK THESE ARE DECISIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I OBJECT TO ESSENTIALLY PUNTING BUT DECISION PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IF IT IS A WORTHWHILE THING TO BE TALKING ABOUT INDEED IT'S- WE HAVE HAD A KERR.

THIS BILL DEFINITION CHANGE TO AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICE. IF DEEPLY CONCERNING BECAUSE THE POLLS AND THE TECHNOLOGY MOST INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES USE TO CALL OR TEXT THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND RESPECT SUCH TECHNOLOGY. REBEL CALLS ARE MADE WITH AUTO DIALERS. THAT RANDOMLY GENERATE PHONE NUMBERS AND WE OPPOSE THE BILL BEAMING ALL BATTLING TECHNOLOGY WHICH BAKER CALLED STORE TELEPHONE NUMBERS. AT THE AUTO DIAL GLOBAL CALL. COMPANIES USE TECHNOLOGY. TO EFFECTIVELY OTHER CONSUMERS AND THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THEIR CUT ARE CONSUMER. WE HAVE FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL WOULD MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO MANUALLY HAND OUT THEIR PHONE NUMBERS. AND AT THIS BILL STEPPED. KNOWLEDGE YOU BY THIRTY YEARS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCONCEIVABLE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY HAND DIAL THE NUMBERS ARE CONSUMERS. IN ORDER TO ASK THE COMMISSION. HE THE DYING TECHNOLOGY TO CALL THEM IN THE FUTURE. RESPECTFULLY ASK THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AT ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WESTCHESTER MODERATED BY BELIEVE ALL PEOPLE OFF THE Q.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MR CHOW YUN I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION QUITE A FEW TIMES IN THE LAST SIX YEARS- I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- IN REGARDS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNWANTED CALLS AND TEXTS TO. PRESENT CORNER THANK YOU AND I SHOULD GOAL I'M TRYING TO GET TO A POSITION OF SUPPORT THIS BILL AND IT'S CHANGED A LOT IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I AND YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. I HAVE ONE MAJOR CAN. IN WHICH IT. IN THIS BILL THE MAN YOU ARE TAKING OUT EXEMPTION FOR IS THAT THE PRE TING RELATION WITH HER NUMBERS TO BE ABLE TO TAX. CUSTOMER IN AN ON CALL THE MINUTE MAID WHAT AND IT HAD QUORUM THOSE COST. TO HAVE A EXPRESS CAN OF THOSE OF THE CUSTOMER BEFORE ISSUING THAT. MANY SO MY- I CAN THIS IS SO WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS COME ACROSS THAT ALREADY HAVE A WITH HER BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY TECH THEM FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I GO TO THE PHARMACY IF I'M FEELING A PRESCRIPTION FOR A FIFTH MEMBER I GET A BY TEXT AND PERCEPTION HAS FILLED. I WANT THAT TEXT BUT WOULD EXPRESSLY CAN STAFF TO HAVE THE EXTENT OF BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE PHARMACY DIDN'T THIS BILL WAS COMING THERE UNABLE TO HAVE ASKED ME FOR NOW FOR THAT EXPRESSED CONCERN MY QUESTION IS HOW YOU WANT TO DO WITH THAT. BECAUSE PUTTING THESE COMPANY A CATCH TWENTY WORK YOU'RE REQUIRING ARKANSAS THAT THEY DID KNOW THEY HAD ASKED FOR. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY OF ASKING. CONSENT YOU'RE NOT. THEM COMMUNITY CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. I THINK- DOT CONCERN IS ALSO WITH ALSO ECHO BY A COUPLE OTHER ALL COLORS. SO ARE THE YOU KNOW I WANT TO. YOU KNOW MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT UNDER OUR CURRENT FEDERAL LAW THERE IS NO EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP- IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. HAVING SAID THAT I THINK ARE RIGHTFULLY SO THERE ARE EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHO PREVIOUSLY HAVE GIVEN THEIR CONSENT. AND I THINK THE LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE TO BE TWEAK A LITTLE BIT MAKE OUT ACCOMMODATION WE DON'T WANT ANY REDUNDANCY IN THAT REGARD SO IF CUSTOMER HAVE. ALREADY THEIR CONCERN. WE NEED TO RETAIN THAT IT WILL WANT THEM TO OUR KNOW REEKER AGAIN SO THERE'S A THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD OKAY WELL THE QUOTA QUESTION SPECIFICALLY SO I NEVER TOLD MY PHARMACY THAT THEY HAD MY CONSENT TEXT THAT MY PRESCRIPTION WAS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HAVE FOR YOUR- HOW. HOW ARE THEY GOING. MIKE INSTEAD IF THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COME. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU NEED SOME KIND OF A PROVISION. TO IF NOT GRANDFATHER THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ALLOW THEM A GRACE PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO SAY HEY LOOK WE NEED YOUR CONSENT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE COMMUNICATING WITH YOU YOU KNOW TAX BACK ONE IF YOU CONSENT OR WHATEVER IT IS I MEAN. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH WITHOUT. YOU KNOW WITHOUT A STE- REQUIRING YOU PUTTING ALL THESE COMPANIES IN THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO YEAH I DO SEE A CONCERN I THINK WHAT. MISSION I THINK THE GRANDFATHER PROVISION ME. AWAY RESULT THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT. YEAH THE ROCK IS AS WELL. AS WE GO FOR. I AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SUCH. YOU KNOW LET ME KNOW ALSO. AND SO YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT TO LEGITIMATE CONCERN SO I WANT TO RESOLVE DOWN ALSO. GOING FORWARD BEFORE YOU KNOW GETS TOO FAR OKAY SO JUST BE TO BE CLEAR YOU'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THAT WITH. WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. THAT'S ALSO A PROBLEM THAT'S THE GAME PLAN YES OKAY. SHOT AND I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION WITH YOUR FOR MISTER ISSUE. THERE YOU GO AHEAD AND I'M WITH AND WE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THERE IS A SECTION OF THE BILL ON THE VERY FIRST PART. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I FIND A LOT IT SAYS. IT'S THE END OF THE- PLACE. AUTOMATIC DIALING. ANNOUNCING DEVICES. BE INTER. AS TO PREVENT THE EXT. OF AUTOMATICALLY. DESIGNED TO EVADE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ARTICLE. THAT'S SOMETHING I VERY RARELY SEEN IN LEGISLATION. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT IS. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ON EARTH YOU WOULD EVER ENFORCE THAT ARTICLE IS VERY SPECIFIC. AND IF SOMEONE DESIGNS. AUTOMATED DIALING EQUIPMENT TO EVADE THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN. SAY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU KNOW WE- WE THINK IS ON THE RIGHT AUTOMATED DIALING EQUIPMENT. FOR WE'RE NOT TO TELL YOU EXACTLY. WHAT IT IS. I GOT IT SO WE'LL BE HAPPY AT THAT AS WELL. OKAY YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH THE INTEL LANGUAGE IS NOT BINDING OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW SO. SO WE'LL BE HAPPY TO CONNECT WITH GOD IF NECESSARY.
