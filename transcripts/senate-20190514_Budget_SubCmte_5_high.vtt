IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THE

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.259
COMMUNITY AS TO HOW THEY WANTED

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.661
US TO STRUCTURE.

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.062
THE CONTRACTS DID THEY WANT AS

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.197
THE STRUCTURE.

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:39.798
THE CONTRACTS AT ON A REGIONAL

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.000
BASIS DID THEY WANT THEM TO BE A

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.302
SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN TARGET

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.104
POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HIGH NEEDS

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.739
FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR ROUND TABLE A

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.507
FEW WEEKS AGO WE HEARD THAT.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.308
CHILDREN WHO HAVE PARENTS ARE

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:50.843
INCARCERATED HAVE A PARTICULAR

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:51.944
HIGH NEED.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.312
SO THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.013
RIGHT NOW AND SO WE FELT WE

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.382
WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD A

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.584
ROBUST PROCESS AND OF COURSE --

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.952
WE APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FOR THE

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:01.520
FUTURE YEARS SAID THAT WE HAVE

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:02.721
THE ABILITY TO AWARD.

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:03.989
ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:07.025
DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS IN THE

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:07.926
FIRST YEAR.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.228
SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:10.696
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE -- MORE

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.899
LOOK.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:18.070
WHICH THE MONEY WAS NOT SPENT SO.

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.805
THIS DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YOU

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.640
DIDN'T SPEND IT YOU LOSE IT.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.575
AT THAT IS CORRECT THE MONEY

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:25.144
WOULD REVERT TO THE MENTAL

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.646
HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUN.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.281
HERE SO I DIDN'T GO INTO RESERVE.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.483
NO THOUGH THAT -- THESE ARE

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.050
STATE ADMIN MENTAL HEALTH

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:32.985
SERVICES.

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.953
THROUGH A REAPPROPRIATION YOU'RE

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.321
YOU'RE GONNA TRY IT AGAIN.

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:37.923
ARE YOU GONNA SPEND IT THIS YEAR.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.291
YES WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.759
THE MONEY OUT FOR BID SO

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.795
NORMALLY WE WOULD ONLY HAVE SIX

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:43.862
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:45.130
DOLLARS TO PUT OUT TO BID IN A

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:46.999
COMPETITIVE PROCESS. FOR THE

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:48.434
FIRST YEAR WHICH WE INTEND TO

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.735
HAVE A THREE YEAR CONTRACTS

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.537
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT OUT TO BID

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:52.805
ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.807
SO THAT'S HOW WE INTEND TO SPEND

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.008
THE MONEY NEXT YEAR JUST JUST A

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:57.910
I'M SORRY -- JUST ONE MORE THING

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:59.244
I THINK WHAT'S HARD ABOUT THIS

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:00.279
ISSUE AND IN SOME OF THESE

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:01.613
ISSUES THAT COME UP LATE IN THE

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.816
BUDGET ACT AS WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:07.719
SORT OF MONTHS TO PLAN AHEAD HOW --

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.688
TO HOW -- TO DO A COMPETITIVE

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.023
BID FOR THESE GRANTS IT WAS SORT

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:12.090
OF A LAST MINUTE ADD TO THE

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:13.625
BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S WHY THERE

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.427
WAS A DELAY IN.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:18.430
GETTING ALL THE FUNDING OW OKAY

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.631
SO THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY.

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:20.232
THEY DIDN'T GET ACCOMPLISHED

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:21.233
BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.805
YEAR -- YOU'RE EXPECTING YOU

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:27.773
YOU'RE CALLING IT A ONE TIME BUT

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.274
YOU WILL YOU HOPE TO GET IT FOR

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.342
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS WELL SO

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.777
YOU'RE SAYING.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.512
OF THESE ARE ONGOING FUNDS AND

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.948
SO -- WE INTEND TO FOLLOW A

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.282
SIMILAR PROCESS THAT THE MENTAL

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.450
HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.651
ACCOUNTABILITY HAS FOLLOWED WITH

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:41.153
THEIR STAKEHOLDER CONTRACTS THAT

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.788
THEY EXECUTE FIRST FOR SPECIAL

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.823
POPULATIONS LIKE VETERANS GROUPS.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.326
WHICH IS -- TO ISSUE THREE YEAR

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:49.862
CONTRACTS AND THEN ASSESS HOW

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.630
THOSE CONTRACTS WENT USING OUR

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.031
OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:54.566
WE'VE BUILT A LOOK AT THE

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.101
OUTCOMES OF THOSE.

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:57.202
POTENTIALLY PRIORITIES WILL

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:59.705
SHIFT THE COMMUNITY MAY IDENTIFY

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.507
THAT THE NEEDS OF OF OF CHILDREN

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:02.841
WHO HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS IS

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.376
THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.344
FIRST YEAR.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.745
FIRST THREE YEARS OF CONTRACTS

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.313
BUT MAY DETERMINE THAT SOME

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.015
OTHER PRIORITY IS HOW WE SHOULD

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:11.583
PUT OUT AN RFP THREE YEARS FROM

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.084
NOW.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.619
SO FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE THE

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:14.953
PRIORITY THREE YEARS FROM NOW

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.623
WOULD BE TO REALLY FOCUS ON

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:20.158
RECEIVING OF BIDS FROM.

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.427
RE ENTRY COUNCILS TO TRY TO WORK

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.262
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMALLY

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.063
INCARCERATED TO HELP THEM BETTER

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.732
ACCESS LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:27.366
SERVICES.

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.935
SO THIS IS GOOD FOR ALL FIFTY

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:30.669
EIGHT COUNTIES.

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:31.904
THAT IS REALLY PART OF THE

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.171
COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:35.874
AGAIN -- I THINK HOW WE HAVE

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.010
SEEN IT BE -- ISSUED IN THE PASS

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.244
THROUGH THE THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.579
SERVICES OVERSIGHT

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.080
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION HAS

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.949
BEEN USUALLY ONE STATE Y.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.250
CONTRACT.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.386
WITH MULTIPLE SMALLER REGIONAL

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:50.155
CONTRACTS SO THAT -- THAT THERE

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.623
CAN BE A FOCUSED EFFORT IN

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.992
SMALLER PORTIONS OF THE STATE IS

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.427
IT ENOUGH MONEY.

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.895
I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A VERY

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.463
SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR A VERY

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.465
LARGE PROBLEM SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.767
DISCUSSED LAST TIME I WAS HERE.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.268
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:04.169
INTEND TO DO WITH OUR

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.071
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS ISSUE

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.306
THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.574
THOSE REPORTS WILL BE PROVIDED

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.876
TO YOU -- SUMMARIZING THE

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:11.677
CONTENT OF EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:14.046
HEARD -- AND I EXPECT THAT WHAT

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:15.414
WE MIGHT HEAR THROUGH THE

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.015
PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS A

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.216
HIGHER NEED AND THAT THERE'S

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:19.785
MORE INTEREST FOR RESOURCES FOR

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:22.054
THIS WORK.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.423
BOB -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.491
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.193

ELECTED TO DO THAT MAYBE TWENTY

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.065
OF THE FIFTY EIGHT BUT IT SEEMS

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:33.699
LIKE THIS WOULD DOVETAIL REALLY

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.067
WELL.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.268
WITH THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE

THEY HAVE DATE IS FILED LAWSUITS

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.683
TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF FUNDING

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.885
OR WAS DISAPPROVED BY THE

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.028
THIS.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.830
IT'S THAT SKEWS ME AT SEVERAL OF

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:05.564
OUR COUNCIL.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.065

MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTE IN THE

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:49.975
COUNTY.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:50.909
OF ORANGE.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.478
AND I'M JUST WONDERING --

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:54.613
COLLEAGUES AT THIS IS ENOUGH

[inaudible]

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.948
THAT.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:57.482
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:59.484
PERCENTAGE OF STATE INMATES HAVE

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:01.086
MENTAL ILLNESS I WOULD ASSUME

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.320
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.522
WEEKS.

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:05.590
TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS.

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.326
AND TO WORK WITH FAMILIES -- AND

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:09.361
IF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:10.962

WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING FOR MORE?

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:18.537
I THINK THAT WE WANT TO PROVE

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:20.972
THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL -- AT

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.441
I KNOW I KNOW THAT LAST TIME I

WAS HERE THERE WERE SOME

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.078
QUESTIONS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WE

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:27.713

CURRENTLY STAFF TO FOR POSITIONS.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:32.951
I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY --

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.286
TO DO REALLY GOOD WORK WITH THIS

00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:36.188
BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PART

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:38.590
OF THE THE DESIRE TO SPEND THE

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.491
MONEY ON A REALLY ROBUST

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:41.026
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND TO

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.066
INCARCERATED PARENTS WERE

LOOKING FOR PEER MENTORS OR IT

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.736
COULD BE FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:06.438
DO MORE ADVOCACY SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.672
SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD FROM RE

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:08.707
ENTRY COUNCILS.

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:09.608
IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.543
INTERESTED IN BEING A TRAIN TO

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.844
GO AND TALK TO THEIR BOARD OF

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:13.745

STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE REALLY

WILL HAVE A SERIES ABOUT THIRTY

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:24.789
DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WE WANT TO

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.824
ASK THE COMMUNITY.

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.425
IN TERMS OF OF WHAT SHOULD BE

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:28.894
THE PRIORITY SHOULD THE PRIORITY

SHOULD IT BE ACE OF AN ONGOING

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.605
SERVICE LIKE A CRISIS LINE FOR

CHILD IS -- ARRESTED AND THAT'S

00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:47.812

US AND AND WE WILL BRING THOSE

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.284
RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR BOARD AND

IN NOVEMBER THE BOARD WILL

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:54.920
DETERMINE.

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.454
HOW THEY WANT TO STRUCTURE THOSE

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.523
ARE OF PEAS THEY MAY DETERMINE

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.157
BASED ON EVERYTHING WE HERE IN

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.792
THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY ONLY

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:06.064
WANT TO ISSUE -- A COMPETITIVE

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.933
PROCESS.

FOR I KEEP BRINGING THIS UP BUT

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:09.167
CHILDREN WHO HAVE INCARCERATED

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:09.434
PARENTS.

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:09.968
WHO NEED SERVICES IN THE

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.636
COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE IDENTIFIED

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:13.471
THROUGH THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:15.040
AS WELL AS THE RESEARCH PROCESS

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:16.641
WHEN I SEE RESEARCH LITERATURE

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:17.943
REVIEW KEY INFORMANT INTO

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.778
INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS FOCUS

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.913
GROUPS -- THAT THAT IS SUCH AN

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.248
UNMET NEED THAT IT IS THE

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.283
BIGGEST PRIORITY FOR THE FIRST

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.785
THREE YEARS OF THESE FUNDS.

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:29.654
THE ALLOCATION TODAY IS TO

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.356
DEVELOP THAT OUR P. NOT%

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.891
NECESSARILY DEFINED [inaudible]

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:37.128
THE WHATEVER ACTIVITY.

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:38.863
ACTUALLY IT IS TO FUND THE

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.865
ACTIVITY AND THE THE FUNDS THAT

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.435
WE HAVE USED THIS YEAR SO FAR

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.803
HAVE SUPPORTED THAT STAKEHOLDER

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:46.905
PROCESS WE'RE ABLE TO CARRY SOME

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.406
OF THOSE DELIVERABLES INTO AN

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:50.342
OVER THE SUMMER AND OF COURSE

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:50.875
WERE RIGHT IN OUR OF P.

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.912
OURSELVES -- IN IT AS PART OF MY

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.247
TEAM AND SO THIS REAPPROPRIATION

00:26:56.314 --> 00:27:00.185
WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO CONTRACTS.

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:01.219
THEN IN THE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.054
FROM THE DISCUSSION SO FAR.

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:09.761
THE THE SERVICES AND THE DATA

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.362
GATHERING I'D SAY OUR RESEARCH

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:10.929
IS [inaudible]

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:15.800
ON FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY OUT OF

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:18.069
THE SYSTEM THEY MIGHT BE ON

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.105
PAROLE BUT THEY'RE NOT.

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:21.773
IN MAKES HOUSE TO NOW IN IN ONE

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.241
OF OUR FACILITIES [inaudible]

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.878
CORRECT OR TO BE HONEST WE WERE

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.980
THIS WAS NOT A B. C. P. -- AND

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.415
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.951
QUESTIONS WE REALLY WANT TO ASK

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.686
WHEN I SAY IT WAS AN A B. C. P.

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:35.854
THERE WAS AN TO M..

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.122
WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:38.656
AWARDED THESE FUNDS LAST YEAR AS

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:41.292
PART OF BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS --

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.961
AND SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:43.762
THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.530
THERE WAS NO DIRECTION AS TO

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:47.332
WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE. FOR

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.267
INDIVIDUALS ONLY WHO OF ALREADY

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.836
EXITED INCARCERATION AND OR ONLY

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.538
INDIVIDUALS INSIDE WHO ARE

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:54.272
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.640
INCARCERATION I THINK IT WOULD

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:57.375
BE A CRITICAL ISSUE TO ASK THE

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:59.144
COMMUNITY BECAUSE BOTH ARE

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.646
REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- BUT

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:03.581
AGAIN.

00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:05.550
I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.085
INCLUDING THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.520
SHOULD TELL THE COUNCIL WHAT IS

00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:10.355
THE PRIORITY IF IT'S PEOPLE WHO

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.122
ARE HOME.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.390
WHO'VE BEEN INCARCERATED OR WHO

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:13.558
ARE GREAT RISK OF RE

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.427
INCARCERATION OR EVEN INITIAL

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:18.363
INCARCERATION OF VERSUS PEOPLE

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.897
WHO MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:19.798
PERSPIRATION.

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:20.732
I RAISE THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.534
BROUGHT THIS UP IN THE PREVIOUS

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.570
DISCUSSION BUT IT'S MORE ROOM.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.238
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:30.341
REALLY HOUSE IN CDC ARE.

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:32.877
IF IT'S IF WERE FOCUSED

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:36.414
PRIMARILY ON THE FOLKS WHO ARE

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:39.451
CURRENTLY IN A STATE FACILITY.

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.219
THEN THERE IS THERE SOME LOGIC

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:43.221
TO IT BEING IN CDC ARE IF IT'S

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:44.489
PEOPLE WHO ARE.

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.691
EITHER FAMILIES -- FOR PEOPLE

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:49.160
WHO ARE ALREADY -- WHO ARE NO

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.429
LONGER MAYBE UNDER PAROLE BUT NO

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:54.132
LONGER IN A STATE FACILITY THEN

00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.301
IT SEEMS LIKE THE ACTIVITY MAY

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.535
BE BETTER HOUSE?

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:01.439
NOT WITHIN CDC ARE. ONE OF THE

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.374
THINGS I I THINK I'VE NEGLECTED

00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.476
TO DO WHEN I WAS HERE LAST TIME

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.710
WAS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:07.312
BACKGROUND ABOUT WHO MY COUNCIL

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:08.513
MEMBERS ARE.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.181
I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT -- YOU

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.816
KNOW MY KIND OF DIRECT CHAIN OF

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:15.120
COMMAND BUT I ALSO -- WORK FOR

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.554
MY COUNCIL MEMBERS MY COUNCIL

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.556
MEMBERS REPRESENT A VARIETY OF

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:20.358
DIFFERENT LOCAL EXPERTS --

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.360
BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.495
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS SO

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.897
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.234
THIS OF THAT WAY WOULD BE.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.202
APPROPRIATE I DON'T KNOW.

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:46.370
HOW WE WANT TO DISCUSS THIS

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.605
ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S A

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:47.905
[inaudible]

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:55.413
IT'S TO ME IT SERVICE -- CONCEPT

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:57.148
IT'S BEEN USE OTHER PLACES THAT

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:59.050
SIMPLY IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:00.217
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF.

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.485
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE HAVING

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:04.689
HERE IS REALLY GOOD -- SCRATCH

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.924
THE SURFACE OR MAKE A BIG IMPACT

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.292
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.194
PROBABLY HAVE TO TARGET THIS

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:10.895
MONEY SOMEWHERE.

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:14.065
A LITTLE BIT.

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:15.900
SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS.

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.735
CENTER MORE LUCK THANK YOU MADAM

OUT IN A POLICING COUNTER.

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:35.953

TOTALLY.

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.657
SENATOR BILL I THINK IT'S WORTH

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:02.626
MORE DISCUSSION AND ALSO ON THIS

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:03.494
COMMITTEE -- GROUPS ARE MORE

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:07.231
LIKE -- THE MIDDLE ILL.

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.566
PART OF THE CORRECTIONS

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.234
DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF THEBIGGEST

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.770
COST DRIVERS IN OUR BUDGET

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:13.904
INCREASE IN THIS.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.906
AREA SO.

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:18.809
SINCE IT IS SUCH A HUGE COST

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:21.812
DRIVER IN TERMS OF THE COST OF

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.381
PROVIDING -- CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.549
SERVICES CENTER CORRECTIONS

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:26.817
DEPARTMENT.

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.586
IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MAIN

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:30.821
FOCUSES OF THIS COMMITTEE.

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:33.891
MY OPINION BECAUSE IT IS COSTING

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.093
IT THE BUDGET INCREASES.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.328
WELL IN ANSWER WHY ARE WE HAVING

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:39.830
INCREASES WHEN THE POPULATION

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:40.130
[inaudible]

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:43.801
OF THE INMATE POPULATION IS

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.403
EITHER STABLE OR GOING DOWN.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.905
WELLS BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.941
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT REQUIRE.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.877
TREATMENT -- YOU KNOW OTHER

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:55.246
FACTORS LIKE AGING BUT WE'RE

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.313
GOING TO FIND OUT A FEW MINUTES

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.648
BUT YOU KNOW.

00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:59.083
THE MENTAL ILLNESS PART HAS

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:01.385
NEVER BEEN.

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.420
IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY ANALYZE

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:05.990
IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT KIND OF

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:08.125
ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE.

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.094
TO ATTACK THE COST DRIVERS THAT

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.229
WE HAVE HERE THE COST INCREASED

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:12.930
DRIVER.

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.632
YOUR YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THOSE

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.533
POSH DRIVERS.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.969
FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN DO.

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.504
SO FROM OF THEY JUST DID A

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.605
SURVEY AND THEY FOUND THAT.

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:22.806
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:27.144
MOST -- BEING BILLIONAIRES PER

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.213
PER CAPITA.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.781
AND SO THE MILLIONAIRES AND MY

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:32.816
DISTRICT OR SAND WHAT AM I

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:35.119
GETTING FOR MY 1%.

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:35.953
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.854
BILLIONAIRE'S SAM CISCO ARE

APPS.

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:42.393
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE NOT TO WALK.

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:42.960
YOU KNOW SO.

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.628
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:46.997
I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO NOT

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:47.631
BE DOING PHASE INS WE NEED TO BE

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:48.265

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:50.267
YOU KNOW.

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.503

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.405
THREE OR IF WITH ALL THE IPOS

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.906

LITTLE.

00:42:57.107 --> 00:42:58.776

FIGURING OUT QUICKLY WHAT TO DO

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.114
WITH THOSE FUNDS.

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:08.419
SO ARE VERY.

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:09.954
THIS WAS A IMPORTANT WILL NEED A

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.088
DISCUSSION.

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:14.658
WELL IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY.

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:17.194
GIVE US A ROADMAP YET WE

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:20.464
CERTAINLY -- CAN GIVE IT MORE

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.266
TIME WHEN WE'RE NOT UNDER THE

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.667
CONSTITUTIONAL PRESSURE OF

SOME OF ITS SHORTCOMINGS --

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.490
WE'VE LEARNED MORE FROM HAVING

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.125
THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:29.393

NEED A TO DEAL WITH A FEMALE

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.794
POPULATION ON THE MAIL -- SO WE

PATIENTS WHO ARE DISABLED.

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.308
AND WE DID NOT APPROPRIATELY

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:21.178
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AGING OF

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:23.380
THE PRISON POPULATION ON INMATES

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:26.984
OVER -- FIFTY IN AND BASED UPON

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.619
NEW INFORMATION THAT WE LOOKED

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:35.526
IN THOSE OUT LOCATIONS.

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.161
THAT WAS THE FIRST IN A PRIMARY

00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:40.230
CARE SERVICES SECOND WE REALIZE

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:42.366

HAVE VERY COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS --

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.677
AND WE NOW HAVE REALIZE WE NEED

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.078

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:58.882
ALLOCATIONS FOR THOSE PATIENTS.

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.450
AND THEN -- FINALLY -- ANCILLARY

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:05.322
STAFF WHO SUPPORT OUR PROVIDERS --

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.391
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:08.825

FOR A CHANGE IN -- OUR ANCILLARY

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.770

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:23.073
OF FOR THE THE REQUEST.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.777
FOR AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE MEDICAL

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:30.080
CLASSIFICATION MODEL.

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:32.983
I KNOW THE LA -- SO ORIGINALLY.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.984
OR NOT ORIGNALLY THAT'S AN

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:37.654
INACCURATE WHEN WE WERE FIRST --

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:41.124
DEVELOPING THE AGENDA.

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.526
FOR THIS HEARING WE WERE GONNA

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.027
HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THIS

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:45.963
HOWEVER WE ARE NOW HAVING A

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:50.434

THE ABILITY TO TO ACT ON SUCH

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:12.923
THINGS -- INDEPENDENT OF OF THE

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.658
LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:14.958
[inaudible]

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:18.862
AND THE PAST INFORMATION BASED

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:23.033
ON THE STEPPING ALLOCATION

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.636
SYSTEMS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE.

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.970

AND THEIR NEEDS AND IDENTIFIED

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.915
WHICH I THINK MOST OF US

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:41.151
PROBABLY COULD'VE WITHOUT EVEN.

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:43.587
NECESSARILY HAVING THE DATA TO

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:45.822
KNOW THAT OUR POPULATION IS

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.357
GETTING OLDER.

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.893

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.662
GENERAL POPULATION.

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:54.298
THE HEALTH NEEDS ARE MEDICAL

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.466
REQUIREMENTS INCREASE.

00:48:56.533 --> 00:49:00.604

OPINIONS SO I'M GONNA LET LA --

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.913
EXPRESS THOSE AND CLEARLY SINCE

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.214
WE PULL THAT WE CAN HAVE A

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:11.581
DISCUSSION NOW.

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.499
WHETHER THAT DATA IT IS

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.001
SUFFICIENT TO ADJUST THAT MODEL

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:34.071
CURRENTLY -- WE NOTE THAT THE

SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN PLACE.

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:58.028
WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.597
FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:01.665

COULD BE HARD TO FILL HOWEVER WE

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:30.260

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.028
IN THE PAST THE RECEIVER HAS

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:33.430

TEMPORARY.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.282
AND NOT IN ALL CASES BUT VERY

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.284
OFTEN THOSE ARE FINE -- FOR

FUNDING ALLOCATION BUT WE DID

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.200
THIS YEAR?

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:12.169

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.606
THESE ARE NOT POSITIONS THAT ARE

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:19.209
EASY TO FILL IN JEST ESPECIALLY

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:21.344

AND IT COULD BE THAT.

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.950
THEY DON'T EVEN GET FILLED RIGHT

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.952
AWAY AND SO THEN HOW DO WE EVEN

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.755

SOME OF THESE WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.402
FOR ALL.

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:46.236
ARM WHICH YOU PUT ME IN A

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:48.338
POSITION OF HAVING TO THE SIDE

WORLD WHAT DO I DO AND THE WHITE.

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:52.042
EXPAND THE USE OF REGISTRY ONE

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.311
HOW DO I RESPOND TO THAT SO I I

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:55.979
THINK A ONE YEAR FUNDING OF

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.247
SIMPLY FOR THESE TYPE OF

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.950
POSITIONS DOESN'T WORK -- I

00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:04.087
WOULD NOTED -- IN ADDITION -- IN

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.455
THE IF THIS GIVES APPROVED OF

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.990
THE WAY TO THE AND ACTUALLY GET

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.325
BUDGET SAVINGS.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.894
IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:11.862
WHO ARE INCARCERATED.

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:14.030
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:16.500
ARE DYING IN PRISON -- AFTER

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:18.969
HAVING GONE THROUGH EXPENSIVE

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.104
MEDICAL TREATMENT.

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:26.476
OF FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO STOP

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.844
HAVING THEM OF THESE MOST

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:29.846
VULNERABLE AND EXPENSE OF PEOPLE

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:32.182
IN PRISON -- I THINK THAT

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.518
ACTUALLY ON IT IS A BETTER

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:35.519
SOLUTION.

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.754
THEM -- HAVING US TRY TO DO THIS

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.757
ON A ONE TIME BASIS.

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.158
ON THAT NOTE.

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:46.062
LET US LET US -- OKAY LET'S DO

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.464
SOME CONJECTURE.

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:50.200
LET'S SAY WE WERE.

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:53.270
TO RE VISIT OUR MEDICAL PAROLE

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:56.039
ON OUR ELDERLY PAROLE --

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.209
POLICIES WHICH WERE DESIGNED. TO

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:03.179
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD -- PEOPLE

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:04.714
IN PRISON THAT WERE VERY

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:07.717
ADVANCED STAGES AND THAT ALSO IN

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:10.320
MANY CASES WERE -- COMPUTER

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.589
THERE MANY OF MEDICAL CONDITION

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:15.892
INCAPACITATED SO FROM A POINT OF

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.661
VIEW OF CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:20.497
SAFETY IN LITTLE TO NO POSITION

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:23.466
TO BE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.969
HOWEVER WERE OF A HIGH HIGH COST

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:27.771
TO THE STATE BY KEEPING THEM IN

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:29.372
THE WAY THAT.

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.241
THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY HOUSE SO

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.877
LET'S ON THAT CONJECTURE -- IN

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:36.179
ASSUME THAT WE'VE MADE THOSE

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:37.447
POLICIES MORE ROBUST.

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:39.316
AND LET'S SAY THOSE WITHIN THREE

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.317
YEARS WE ARE TO MAKE THOSE

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.285
POLICIES MORE ROBUST AND THEY

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.487
WERE STARTING TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.890
WOULD DOUBT ARGUES TO APPROVE

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.158
ALL OF THESE POSITIONS ARE

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:50.160
PERMANENTLY AS YOU'VE SUGGESTED

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.362
SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS GIVEN.

00:53:52.429 --> 00:53:54.130
THAT SO.

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.366
SO I'M DOING VARIATION NOW SO LA --

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:58.335
SAID DO IT ONE TIME ONLY I THINK

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.136
WE'VE REYES THAT ONE TIME ONLY

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.671
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE NATURE OF

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:02.939
THESE TYPE OF POSITIONS.

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.240
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.309
PAST WE DIDN'T NEED AS MANY

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.778
EXCEPT FOR THIS YEAR SO.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:11.615
IS THERE A HYBRID HERE ARE THERE

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:13.016
A FEW LESS POSITIONS.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.718
POTENTIALLY THAT WE NEED FOR

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:18.254
LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT.

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.456
IT WAS ONLY THIS ONE YEAR.

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:22.892
THAT WE EXCEEDED OUR THE

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:25.395
EXPENSES EXCEEDED OUR ALLOCATION --

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:31.201
MANAGER THE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT --

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:33.103
THERE ARE REDUCTIONS.

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.038
OF REDUCTIONS IN STAFF WILL

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.607
HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY -- AS PART

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:41.344
OF THE ON A REGULAR POPULATION

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:43.213
ADJUSTMENT PROCESS.

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:49.719
SO -- YOU'RE PROVING PERMANENT

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.455
POSITIONS BOUGHT THEIR SUBJECTS.

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:54.991
TO OUR POPULATION REDUCTIONS SO

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:57.293
IT IT NATURALLY WILL HAPPEN THAT

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.496
THERE WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:00.864
STAFF IF IT TURNS OUT THAT.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.900
WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE SOME OF OF

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.135
THE THESE.

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:09.506
WORKLOAD DRIVING POPULATIONS.

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.041
AND IN TERMS OF WHETHER I THINK

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:11.508
THOSE WHO YOU KNOW.

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:12.342
IS IT HALF OF THESE THAT WE

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:13.643
ACTUALLY NEED NO I THINK WE

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.612
ACTUALLY NEED -- EVERYTHING THAT

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.313
WERE ASKING FOR HERE

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:17.614
[inaudible]

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:22.485
HELLO. ONE OPTION IF WE WANT TO

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:23.787
GO FORWARD WITH APPROVING THIS

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:24.888
IS CHANGE THE METHODOLOGY WOULD

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.256
BE TO REQUIRE REPORTING ON

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:27.957
ACTUAL USAGE RELATIVE TO WHAT

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:30.660
THE MODEL IS PROVIDING.

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:33.029
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:35.265
IF THERE IS A MISMATCH IN THE

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:35.832
FUTURE AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:36.966
NECESSARY.

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.903
THAT'S A GOOD SUGGESTION.

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:40.570
SENATOR BOB.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.539
DOLE.

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.641
THIS IS BASED ON THE POPULATION

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:45.809
RISE OF THESE KIND OF PATIENTS

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.610
CORRECT.

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.312
THE ADDED STAFF THAT YOU'RE A

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.346
WELL THE END OF STAFF IS

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:52.015
ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE PREVIOUSLY

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.917
DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE HEAVIER

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:57.187
WORKLOAD. FOR WOMEN YEAH -- BUT

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:58.722
YES IT'S BASICALLY ONCE IT'S

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.023
BUILT INTO THE MODEL YEAR OF

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.624
OPERATION THE POPULATION IS

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:03.460
GOING UP -- SO WHEN THE

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:04.828
POPULATION GOES DOWN WHAT

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:06.529
HAPPENS YOU LIMITED THESE

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.997
POSITIONS.

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:10.934
OF WHAT'S WHAT'S THE SITUATION --

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.872
HOW HOW WOULD THAT BE AN?

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:18.007
LOCAL USUALLY -- THE MEDICAL

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:18.975
SYSTEM WILL HAVE LIKE

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:19.676
FLUCTUATIONS IN.

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:21.211
SPECIALLY LIKE AN INPATIENT I

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:21.778
DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HAVING

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:22.812
LIKE A MORE.

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:25.615
IMPATIENT -- ARE YOU LOOKING AT

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.450
Y. EIGHT MORE DAYS PER PATIENT

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.486
IN THE IN PATIENT.

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.887
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE --

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.889
AND SEEMS LIKE YOURS NO CONTROL

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:34.958
OR AB KENTUCKY.

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.559
THAT'S AN AREA I WOULD I WOULD

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:38.261
WONDER ABOUT.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.362
WHEN I SAW THAT I SO WELL HE'S

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:40.396
GOT MORE?

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:43.266
LONGER STAYS IN THE IN PATIENT

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.200
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THE COSTS

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:45.568
MONEY.

00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:47.670
SO WHY WHY IS THAT HAPPENING.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:49.773
WELL IN TERMS OF PROCESS.

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.441
YEAH I'M INTO AND GET SENT TO

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.510
THE NEXT ITEM BUT I'M I'M ASKING

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:54.711
THEM NOW SO YOU.

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.579
YEAH IN MY EYES I'M SUSPICIOUS

00:56:56.646 --> 00:57:02.018
WHY THAT IN PATIENTS GOING UP.

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:02.519
IN TERMS OF THE POSITION

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:03.686
REDUCTIONS -- WE WOULD DO THAT

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.921
THROUGH ATTRITION OR FIND

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:05.755
ANOTHER VACANCIES -- THE LAYOFF

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.423
PROCESSES ARE OUR LAST OPTION

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.957
WHEN IT COMES TO POSITION

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.726
REDUCTIONS AND NORMALLY WITH OUR

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:12.295
POPULATION REDUCTIONS ITS USE ON

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.463
THE MARGIN WE CAN ABSORB THOSE.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.566
OR THESE TEMPORARY INCREASES OR

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.301
THE YOU LOOK LIKE A MORE --

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.603
LEVELING OFFER WHICH STORY --

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.205
WELL I I SUSPECT IS A LEVELING

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.707
OFF THE IF IF THIS CHANGE TO THE

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:28.178
MODELS APPROVED WE FILL THESE-POSITIONS AND THE POPULATION I

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:28.611
DON'T.

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:29.412
KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.514
POPULATION PROJECTIONS ARE I

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:32.549
DON'T THINK THERE [inaudible]

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:35.018
INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.052
NARROWER BUT IT WOULD DOWN THE

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.021
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING IF THINGS

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:40.256
ARE GOING DOWN.

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:40.890
THEY ARE LIKELY WONDERING THEN

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.091
IT WOULD DEPEND ON ARE YOU

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.060
BRINGING DOWN I KNOW WHICH

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:44.894
POPULOUS CORRECT.

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:45.995
YEAH YOU'RE BRINGING DOWN THE

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:48.498
HEALTHY YOUNG GUYS -- THAT HELPS

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:49.833
A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DOESN'T HELP

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:52.535
ALL THAT MUCH SO IT DEPENDS ON

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.337
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:56.206
POPULATION REDUCTION CAN FOCUS

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.174
ON THE IN PATIENT PART OF IT

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:59.242
YEAH LIKE -- LET ME HAVE WIRE

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:02.612
WHERE -- YOU HAVING MORE LONGER

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:04.314
STAYS IN THE IN PATIENT OR MAY

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.348
HAVE DOC KANE AND DO YOU CONTROL

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.216
THAT I MEAN HOW DO YOU CAN.

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:07.417
YOU KNOW LIKE THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:12.689
PRIMARY THINGS HOSPITAL WHO'S

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:16.292
THE THE HAVE PROTOCOLS TO

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:18.962
CONTROL YOUR INPATIENT.

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.730
SO WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK.

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:21.397
OVER A CANE AND I THINK PART OF

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:22.532
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.367
SENATOR BAIL IS ACTUALLY A

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.002
PATIENTS WHO ARE.

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:27.670
ADMITTED TO OUR OUTSIDE

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:29.839
COMMUNITY HOSPITALS THERE WE ARE

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:32.342
SEEN ON ALTHOUGH THE ADMISSIONS

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.110
ARE ACTUALLY NOT GOING UP AT THE

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.079
SAME RATE WE ARE SEEN LONGER

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:38.181
LENGTH OF STAY.

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.449
AND ACTUALLY THAT'S RELATEDTO

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:41.084
THAT TWO THINGS BUT REALLY IT

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.919
REALLY BOILS DOWN -- TO THE

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:46.389
COMPLEXITY OF THE PATIENT A CASE

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.992
MIX -- ONE OF THE POPULATIONS

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.226
THAT STRIVING THAT IS ACTUALLY

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:51.728
OUR PATIENTS ARE GETTING OLDER

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.396
AND SICKER SO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.064
STANCE FOR HIGH RISK ONE INTO

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.065
PATIENTS.

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.734
THAT IS GOING ON UP AND THAT IS

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.469
COMMENSURATE WITH AN INCREASE IN

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:02.772
THE ADMISSIONS TO OUR COMMUNITY

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:03.273
HOSPITAL.

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:04.007
THERE'S ALSO KIND OF A SECOND

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:06.075
GROUP OF OF PATIENTS WHO ARE

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:08.478
REALLY NOT -- WHO WEREN'T AS

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:10.246
COMPLEX -- PRIOR TO

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.015
HOSPITALIZATION BUT THIS IS

00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:13.883
ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE INCREASE

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.085
IN TRAUMA THAT WERE SEEN IN

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:18.788
INCREASES IN -- OVERDOSES AND

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.690
INFECTIONS WERE ACTUALLY RELATED

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.725
TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ON SO

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.594
THOSE TWO DIFFERENT PATIENT

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:26.996
POPULATIONS ARE DRIVING THE

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.831
INCREASE IN ADMISSIONS BUT EVEN

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:29.832
MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.501
DISPROPORTIONATELY.

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:33.102
THEY'RE DRIVING THE INCREASED

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.604
LENGTH OF STAY IN THE COMMUNITY

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.839
HOSPITAL AND I WILL SAY THAT ARE

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.542
WE WE TRACK VERY CLOSELY -- WHEN

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:41.077
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PATIENTS TO

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:43.513
BE DISCHARGED AND PATIENTS ARE

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:46.215
DISCHARGED -- BY AND LARGE WHEN

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.250
THEY NEED TO BE FROM THE

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.318
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WE CALL IT

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:51.321
ADMINISTRATIVE BAD DAYS AND WE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.756
HAVE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF THAT.

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.558
OKAY AND SO CENTER WE ACTUALLY

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.459
DO HAVE -- A YUBA UTILIZATION

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.361
MANAGEMENT TYPE SYSTEMS THAT

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.729
RIGHT AS YOU CAN TELL KEEP TRACK

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:02.131
PRETTY CLOSELY OF OF THESE SORT

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:03.533
OF ISSUES.

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.435
THE DO YOU HAVE -- NO HEALTH

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:08.171
OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS.

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.772
SO YES YOU'RE SAYING THE

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.808
PATIENTS ARE GET ANY BETTER SO

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:14.110
WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY ON HEALTH

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:16.212
OUTCOMES THAT. TO MAKE YOU KNOW

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.413
IS THERE IS THERE A STRATEGY ON

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.382
NOT.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.950
WELL FOR YOUR HEALTH OKAY WE

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.919
CERTAINLY WANT IF YOU LOOK AT ON

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:24.554
IN TERMS OF DEATHS.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.690
EVERYWHERE EXCEPT ON OVERDOSE --

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:29.359
WHAT WE HAVE REDUCE DEATHS OF

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.427
THE DEATH RATES ASSOCIATE OR

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:32.528
DOES IT SHOULD ON A LITTLE BIT

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.930
OVERDOSES OF GONE UP

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.932
SUBSTANTIALLY -- ON OTHER SORTS

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.667
OF CONDITIONS THAT WE WOULD

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:38.501
TYPICALLY.

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:40.103
OF A WAR WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:40.870
OF PATIENTS.

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:43.506
OF DIABETES FOR EXAMPLE ON IN

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.208
STAGE LIVER DISEASE THERE --

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:48.144
WOULD WE TRACK OUR PERFORMANCE --

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.279
VERY CLOSELY AGAINST OF THE

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.315
PERFORMANCE OF OUTSIDE -- THE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.650
MEDICAL HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.652
SYSTEMS ARE IN OUR PERFORMANCE

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.821
CONTINUES TO BE BETTER THAN MOST

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.557
HMO SO -- WAS SIMILAR TO THE VET

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.960
ADMINISTRATION -- AT TIMES

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.294
APPROACHING -- KAISER LEVEL OF

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.063
QUALITY SO WE'RE TRACKING

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.097
OBJECTIVE.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.099
OUTCOME MEASURES ARE ON A

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.634
ROUTINE BASIS AND ARE TRYING TO

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.203
MAKE SURE SUCCESSFULLY I THINK

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:19.809
THAT WERE EXCEEDING.

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:20.877
THE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.845
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF STAFF

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.348
ON THE TABLES A BNC HAVE.

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:31.521
OF THE THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:34.057
ON THAT IS THE I SEE THE THE THE

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:36.959
MAJOR INCREASES IN PHARMACY.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:40.029
AND THEN YOU HAVE -- FOOD.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.665
FOOD SERVICES.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:45.134
OKAY CAN YOU EXPLAIN KNOWS WHY.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.702
FOOD SERVICES WHAT'S GOING ON

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.704
THERE.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.340
IN FOOD SERVICES I DON'T SEE

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:52.975
WHAT WE DID WE LABEL BE ACTUALLY

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.678
YEAH -- FOR THE FOR THE DIETARY

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:58.381
PIECE -- AND COOKS COOKS YEAH

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.183
THE COOKS WOULDN'T HAVE A MODEL

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:01.784
FOR AND SO WE'RE UPDATING OUR

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.453
MODEL BE CONSISTENT WITH CITIES

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:03.719
HERE ARE.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.121
THE EVERY LEAVE.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:08.091
AND THAT RELIEF PROVIDES -- FOR

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.158
THEM TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.095
STAFFING DALY AND WE'D WE HAD

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.663
NEVER BASS LINE OUR COOKS IN OUR

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:16.399
INPATIENT UNITS -- AND SO WE'RE

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.501
RE BASING OUR COOKS TO THE TO

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.503
THE CDC OUR BLUEPRINT MODEL SO

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.804
WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RELIEF

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:26.275
AND STAFFING TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.844
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.713
OKAY DO YOU -- THE NURSES.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.181
THERE'S QUITE A FEW NURSES

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.817
PROPOSALS AND NURSE INSTRUCTORS.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:37.753
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.855
THERE'S BEEN IT.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.124
SHOULD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.459
TRAINING THE THAT IS PROVIDED TO

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.061
OUR OUR NURSING STAFF AND WE

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.229
HAVE.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.030
UPWARDS OF FIVE THOUSAND NURSING

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.901
STAFF -- SO WE SAW A CRITICAL

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.003
GAP WE WE HAVE BASICALLY ONE

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.538
NURSE INSTRUCTOR PER FACILITY.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.473
AND THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.408
INSUFFICIENT -- SO WE'RE CLOSING

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:00.843
THAT GAP ON THE INFECTION

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:04.046
CONTROL -- INFECTION CONTROL --

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.815
WAS NEVER PART OF THE ORIGINAL

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.316
MODEL AND WE CURRENTLY DON'T

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:08.985
HAVE THAT FUNCTION IN OUR

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.987
FACILITIES AND THAT'S A BIG GAP

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.655
IN HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.723
SO.

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.859
WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.194
THAT GAP NOW.

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.195
SO YOU'RE GOING FROM -- ONE SO

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:23.199
THE THIRTY THIRTY TWO WE'RE

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.600
GOING TO THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.269
NURSES.

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.803
SO EACH EACH.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.172
IS FOR SOIL HAVE INFECTION

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.540
CONTROL.

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:32.475
NEVER SPECIFICALLY FOR INFECTION

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.210
CONTROL IN EACH FACILITY CORRECT

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.878
AS OPPOSED TO WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:36.879
ANYMORE YEAH WE JUST DON'T HAVE

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:37.280
IT.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.248
OKAY SO THAT NURSE WILL BE IN

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:42.185
CHARGE OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT YES

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:52.895
OR THE PLANNING FOR THEM -- OKAY --

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.631
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT OUR

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:58.134
POPULATION NUMBERS -- IN TERMS

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.435
OF WHO IS HOUSED CURRENTLY WE

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.939
HAVE.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:03.606
THERE YOU KNOW.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.976
THE HIGHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:07.577
SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN K. A

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:11.247
OUR THOUSAND IN INMATES RIGHT

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.248
NOW.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.649
AND OF THOSE.

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.585
ABOUT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND ARE

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.887
LONG LONG TERM SO WE'VE GOT

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.355
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND LIFERS.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.190
FIVE THOUSAND WALKED.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.292
AND SEVEN THOUSAND THIRD

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.528
STRIKERS SO THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:28.965
THAT ARE -- IT BASICALLY GONNA

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:32.335
GET OLD IN OUR PRISONS AND WHICH

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.803
I THINK IS THE POINT THAT'S

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.439
BEING MADE HERE AND UNLESS WE DO

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.407
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.777
IN TERMS OF IF WE LEAVE ITAS IT

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.145
IS EVEN WITH.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.213
SOME OF THE CHANGES WITH CREDIT

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.684
AND SUCH -- THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.786
OF THESE FOLKS WHO JUST START.

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:52.121
ELIGIBLE DATE SO.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.623
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:58.661
OUR THE COSTS AROUND THE MEDICAL

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.196
IN SUCH INCREASE

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.397
JUST DUE TO THE FACT OF THE

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:05.201
POPULATION THAT WE'RE THE WAY

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:06.769
OUR SENTENCING CONDITIONS AND

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:10.640
SUCH SO -- THIS IS ANOTHER ONE

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:11.874
LIKE HER MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.009
MAY WANNA.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.810
DO SOME HEARINGS IN THE INTERIM

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.045
OR A HEARING.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.681
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.550
PASSED -- POLICIES LIKE

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.286
COMPASSIONATE RELEASE POLICIES

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.888
ON MEDICAL PAROLE POLICIES ON

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.856
ELDERLY.

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:28.858
AND THE DATA THAT WE'VE RECEIVED

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:31.427
TO DATE WOULD INDICATE THAT IT'S

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:34.830
THESE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE --

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:37.199
APPROVED HAVE NOT.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:40.536
THE BEEN RARELY LITTLE UTILIZED.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.271
SO WE MAY WANT TO LOOK FURTHER

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:46.876
AT THAT -- BECAUSE FOR A PUBLIC

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:48.511
SAFETY POINT OF VIEW.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:50.880
OUR HOUSING SOME NUMBER OF THESE

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.581
PEOPLE IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:53.949
BRINGING US PUBLIC SAFETY BUT

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.518
DEFINITELY BRINGING US VERY HIGH

01:05:55.584 --> 01:06:01.023
COSTS -- ANYWAY SO THE GROUP.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.893
WE MAYBE WE COULD ENTERTAIN A

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:07.296
MOTION. TO APPROVE AS BUDGETED

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:09.332
BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF A

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:14.770
REPORT -- AS THE LA -- SUGGESTED

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.539
SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.574
UTILIZATION RATES AND MAKE A

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.578
FUTURE ADJUSTMENT IF NEEDED.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.212
I MAKE A MOTION PICTURE.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:25.181
ALL RIGHT.

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.916
A DEPARTMENT FINANCE JACQUELINE

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:27.783
COME THE PART OF FINANCE I THINK --

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.752
PROVIDING SOME REPORTING METRICS

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:30.853
THAT AREN'T OVERLY

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.987
ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:34.323
MAKES SENSE -- THE THE TERM

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.391
REPORT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.426
ROBUST AND I THINK I WAS MAKING

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.494
BUT DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.129
ACT ON THE METRICS THAT WERE

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:41.897
USED TO JUSTIFY THE REQUEST.

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:44.767
SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ASK OKAY --

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:48.771
YES THAT IS WHAT I WAS INTENDING

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.708
VERSUS -- A LONG -- SUBJECTIVE

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.243
REPORT IT WAS MUCH MORE IN THE

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.679
MATRIX OKAY SO WITH THE

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.347
CLARIFICATION ON THE MOTION I'LL

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.950
TAKE A ROLL CALL.

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.319
CENTER SKINNER HI THERE MARK

WANT TO WITH OUR NEXT ITEM WAS --

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:22.571

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.380
WE HAVE.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.716
ON OUR AGENDA.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:39.488
IS -- WHICH ONE WHICH NUMBER.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.389
TWENTY EIGHT TO TWENTY EIGHT SO

EIGHT AND FOLLOW IT BY ISSUE.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.829
TWENTY EIGHT THAT [inaudible]

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.232
THAT WORK.

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:54.336
SO WE DEAL WITH THE WITH THE

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.704
BACK TO THE NUMBER EATEN.

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.739
YET WE'RE GONNA GO TO EIGHT

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:57.306
RIGHT NOW.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.475
OKAY ISSUE EIGHT THANK YOU MA'AM

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.776
CHAIR -- THE THE BUDGET INCLUDES

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.144
AN AUGMENTATION OF SIXTY ONE

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.345
POINT NINE MILLION OFFER

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:05.014
CONTRACT MEDICAL SERVICES THERE

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.082
ARE I THINK A REALLY TWO ASPECTS

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.617
OF THIS THE FIRST IS.

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:09.819
A STARK CANAAN'S ALREADY

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.821
MENTIONED WE SIMPLY SEEN I

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.923
INCREASES IN LENGTH OF STAY

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.591
INCREASES IN COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:17.092
WITH THE STATE BECAUSE OF

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.928
GREATER COMPLEXITY -- AND

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:20.830
POSSIBLY INCREASES IN THE COSTS

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:26.335
OF OUTSIDE HOSPITAL HERE.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.136
A SHE CAN ADDRESS THOSE IN

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.070
GREATER DETAIL THERE IS A SECOND

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:28.804
ASPECT TO THIS THIS JUST A

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.473
BUDGET MANAGEMENT.

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.508
ON THE ISSUE OF THAT ARE USEFUL

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:33.709
I HAVE TO TAKE PERSONAL

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.178
RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR WE

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.247
ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.582
ON THIS LINE OF OUR BUDGET.

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.684
SEEING INCREASES BEYOND THAT THE

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.186
AUTHORIZATION FOR ABOUT FOUR

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:45.654
YEARS.

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.523
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON DURING

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.825
THOSE YEARS AS WE HAVE COVER

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:50.993
THOSE COSTS.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.562
ARE BASED ON A CENTRALLY SALARY

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.097
SAVINGS BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:57.366
A COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE WE WERE

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.001
SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.736
IN THE OUR STAFFING WHERE WE HAD

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:04.640
AS MUCH AS 2225% VACANCIES IN

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.975
CLINICAL STAFFING.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:09.311
WHICH GENERATED AN ENORMOUS

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:10.946
SAVINGS.

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:12.481
ON END OF SENSUALLY I MADE THE

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.916
MISTAKE I CONSIDERED IN

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.217
RETROSPECT A MISTAKE.

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:17.753
OF USING THOSE SAVINGS TO OFFSET

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.221
THE INCREASES IN CONTRACT

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.756
MEDICAL AND THEN I THINK THE

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.892
MISTAKE WAS NOT TELLING FINANCE

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:25.160
ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS.

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:26.262
THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.664
INCREASE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.266
CONTRACT MEDICAL.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.934
THE RESULT IS WE'RE HAVING TO

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.069
PLAY CATCH UP.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.271
BECAUSE IN THE LAST YEAR.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.940
WE ACTUALLY HAVE FILLED ON

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.608
NEARLY ALL OF THOSE CLINICAL

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.210
POSITIONS.

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:43.412
SO WE DID NOT GENERATE A COST

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.747
SAVINGS THAT WE COULD USE TO

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.715
COVER THIS -- THAT WAS THE

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:49.885
REASON THAT WE HAD -- A REQUEST

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:52.087
FOR A DEFICIENCY -- AND THIS

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:54.456
RELATES TO THE ACT OF SENSUALLY

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.125
WE NEED A ONE TIME CATCH UP.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.394
ON AND I HAVE DONE MY

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.796
APPROPRIATE PENANCE OF OVER THE

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.064
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.400
IN ASSURE THEM THAT THE I WON'T

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.201
BE DOING THIS IN THE FUTURE --

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:11.006
AND THAT WE WILL -- BE SHARING.

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.207
OUR EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:14.610
ON ANY AND ALL INFORMATION ABOUT

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:17.212
PROJECTED INCREASES FOR EXAMPLE

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:18.547
IN CONTRACT MEDICAL OR

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.516
PHARMACEUTICALS.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.917
SO THE BUT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:25.888
OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.958
IS NOT CAUGHT OFF GUARD

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:29.258
[inaudible]

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.193
CENTERVILLE.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.262
SO THE COST DRIVERS -- THE

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:36.365
INPATIENT HOSPITAL -- WHAT KIND

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:39.301
OF -- HOSPITAL TREATMENT ARE YOU

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.770
PUTTING PEOPLE AND IS THIS OF

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.172
INTENSIVE CARE OR REGULAR

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.907
HOSPITAL LIKE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.542
LEVELS.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.077
CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.713
KIND OF PEOPLE OF WHAT WHAT KIND

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.581
OF CARE LEVELS ARE.

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.949
YOU PUTTING PEOPLE AT THE

01:10:54.016 --> 01:11:00.222
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY RESERVE THE

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:00.823
WE BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:01.190
MAYBE.

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:02.091
WELL I'M I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.759
THEM THE DATA FOR YOU IF YOU

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.760
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SORT OF THE

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:06.295
BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT KIND

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.230
OF LEVELS OF CARE ONCE WE SEND

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.832
THE PATIENT ALLAH BUT IT.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.033
IT REALLY IS THE WHOLE CONTINUUM

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.202
THAT YOU THAT YOU MENTIONED -- A

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.437
LOT OF THIS IS DRIVEN -- THROUGH

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.806
THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.541
PATIENT IS THEN ADMITTED ON MOST

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.343
OF THEM GO TO YOU KNOW GENERAL

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.179
MEDICAL -- WARDS OBVIOUSLY THERE

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:26.515
ARE SPECIALIZED A UNITS AS WELL

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:28.751
FOR CARDIOLOGY IS AN EXAMPLE --

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:32.087
AND WE DO A SEND PATIENTS TO THE

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.322
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AS WELL --

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.758
ACROSS ALL THOSE SPECTRUMS ONCE

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.626
THEY'RE HOSPITALIZED WHAT WE ARE

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.862
SEEN OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.730
STAYING LONGER.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:42.998
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CODING

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:45.534
REGARDLESS OF THE DIAGNOSES THAT

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.002
THESE PATIENTS HAVE.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:49.938
IT'S OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH MORE

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.407
COMPLEXITY.

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.809
SO WE'RE SEEING THE SAME TYPE OF

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.744
DIAGNOSES -- THAT WE WERE SEEN

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.147
IN PREVIOUS YEARS EXCEPT THAT

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.983
THEY ARE NOW -- THERE NOW

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.286
CONSIDERED MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.523
ARE YOU -- WHEN YOU SAY HOSPITAL

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.391
INPATIENT WHEN I THINK OF A

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.926
HOSPITAL INPATIENT I THINK OF?

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.395
A HOSPITAL NOT.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:17.566
A NURSING HOME OR YOU'RE NOT.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.034
SENDING PEOPLE TO THOSE KIND OF

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.803
FACILITIES CANNELLA THEY'RE NOT

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.771
REALLY LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES --

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.007
SO REALLY TALKING ABOUT A CUTE

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.842
YOU DON'T A CUTE GENERAL ACUTE

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.478
CARE HOSPITALS SO YOU GO IN

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.379
THERE IN THESE [inaudible]

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.347
SPEND [inaudible]

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:36.418
TIME THERE -- DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.887
WHO SPEND MORE THAN -- A WEEK.

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.090
YES THESE FACILITIES YEAH SO

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.926
WHAT KIND OF THEME IN CLOSE ONES

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.394
ACOSTA OUR MONEY RIGHT.

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:46.395
WELL THE THE COST OF THE COST OF

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:47.930
HOSPITALIZATION IS DEPENDING ON

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.531
A NUMBER OF FACTORS BUT ONE OF

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.066
THE MAJOR DRIVERS THAT WE ARE

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:51.834
SEEING.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.936
IS THAT THEY ARE STAYING LONGER

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.471
ON AVERAGE A LONGER.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.573
SO WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS ARE YOU

01:12:57.639 --> 01:13:00.008
AS ESTABLISHING [inaudible]

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.111
ON THAT.

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.078
AGAIN IT WAS EITHER SAID WE HAVE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:05.414
A VERY ROBUST UTILIZATION

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.549
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM RIGHT STAFF

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:09.151
WITH PHYSICIANS AND NURSES.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.220
AND WE COMMUNICATE WELL ALL OF

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.721
OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS THERE

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.590
ARE SEVERAL DOZEN OF THAT WE

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.025
WORK WITH ON A DAILY BASIS -- TO

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.260
MONITOR WHO WAS RECENTLY

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.762
ADMITTED WHO'S READY FOR

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.864
DISCHARGE AND TO BEGIN THAT

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.832
DISCHARGE PLANNING.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.200
AND AS I MENTIONED.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.969
WE HAVE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.571
PATIENTS WHO WE KNOW ARE READY

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:45.593
COMPLEX PROGRAM IT MAY BE BEST

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.161
FOR US TO JUST JUMP IN THE

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.162
QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO SUMMARIZE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:50.432
IT BUT IT IN THE STAFF REPORT

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.233

OF DESCRIBING ITS COMPONENT

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.670
PARTS.

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:58.940
OKAY I'M LET US SEE IF THERE ARE

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:04.312
QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES OR IF

WE HOLD ON A MINUTE WE DID HAVE

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.551
AN LA -- FOR A RECOMMENDATION

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.185

PERCENT AND THEN WE CAN OPEN FOR

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:13.788
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS GO AHEAD

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:16.458
EARLIER.

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.892
EARLY LOOK WHO'S MORE WITH THE

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.327
LA -- WE DID IDENTIFY A FEW

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.029
CONCERNS WITH THIS THE PROPOSAL

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.297
WE NOTE THAT.

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.665
ASPECTS OF IT ARE EVIDENCE BASED

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:24.265
FOR INSTANCE MEDICATIONS THIS

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.600
TREATMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.035
AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTION

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:28.269
AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.772
HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:30.939
IN.

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.240
MANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:33.007
OF ART THEM THIS IS A LARGE

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.676
SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:37.145
PROGRAM THAT IS UNTESTED BECAUSE

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:38.012
MANY.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:38.847
WHAT INCLUDES ASPECTS OUR

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.081
EVIDENCE BASED NOT ALL ASPECTS

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.049
ARE EVIDENCE BASED IN THIS

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:44.219
COMBINATION OF PROGRAMS HAS NOT

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:47.255
BEEN EVALUATED TO BE EFFECTIVE --

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.723
WE NOTE THAT IN THE ONE ASPECT

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:49.858
THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TREATING

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.593
PATIENTS WITH A FORM OF

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.495
MEDICATION AND IT LONG LASTING

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.496
JEKYLL FROM A GROUP AN ORPHAN

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:55.563
THAT'S NEVER BEEN TESTED IN A

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.664
CORRECTIONAL SETTING TO SEE IF

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:57.766
IT HOW EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE AT

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:58.800
TREATING.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.668
INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO THE

OTHER FORMS OF MEDICATIONS AS

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.037
THE ALL FORMS WHICH ARE SEVERAL

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.540
TIMES CHEAPER.

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.276
THE ONLY -- PILOT OF THIS DRUG

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:09.644
IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED BY

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:10.545
PENNSYLVANIA AND OUR PRISON

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:12.080
SYSTEM.

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:12.680
HOWEVER OR NOT BUT IT HAS RUN

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.249
INTO SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:15.517
ISSUES AND SO.

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:17.051
WHILE I WAS INITIALLY PLANNED TO

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.988
LAUNCH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:20.455
NINETEEN THEY'RE STILL

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:21.022
STRUGGLING TO GET THE FIRST

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.690
PATIENTS ENROLLED.

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:23.558
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ROLL ABOUT

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.894
DRUG OUT STATEWIDE TO TREAT 10%

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.365
OF THE M. A. T. PARTICIPANTS WHO

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:32.500
HAVE AN OPIOID USE DISORDER --

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:33.701
WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE COST

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.235
ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:35.303
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY.

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.604
ESTIMATES ARE BASED OFF OF

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.339
PERCENTAGES THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:41.075
TO BE BASED OFF OF BUT VARIETY

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.177
OF SOURCES INCLUDING OTHER

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.077
STATES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.213
VALIDATED TO REPRESENT THAT CDC

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.250
OUR POPULATION -- AND ALSO ARE

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:51.152
SUBJECT TO ERROR FOR INSTANCE WE

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:52.520
NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:53.822
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.023
PRESCRIBE THE LOCKS ON THE DRUG

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.257
DESIGNED TO REVERSE OPIATE

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:58.827
OVERDOSE IS. TO OFFENDERS GET

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:01.095
BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON --

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:03.565
AND THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.300
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OFFENDERS

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.701
FIVE OR THAT WERE -- PROPOSAL

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.136
NOTES AT ONLY FOUR THOUSAND

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.038
INDIVIDUALS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:13.107
RELEASED EACH YOUR WITHIN --

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.542
BILL USED TO SORT OR THERE ARE

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:15.543
POTENTIALLY OTHER ERRORS OF THIS

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.878
NATURE THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.246
GIVEN THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:20.682
MOVING PARTS INVOLVED -- IN

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:21.716
ADDITION THE FULL COST OF

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.385
IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT IDENTIFIED

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:25.453
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTED THAT

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.056
THIS -- PROGRAM WOULD TAKE FIVE

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.123
YEARS TO IMPLEMENT HOW THE

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.492
PROPOSAL IS ONLY FOR THE FIRST

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.126
THREE YEARS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:34.229
WHAT THE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.497
WOULD BE FOR THE FOLLOWING YOURS

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.030
OR WHAT FUNDING WOULD BE

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.198
NECESSARY.

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.500
THERE'S ALSO LIKELY TO BE

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.034
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RELATED TO

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:42.337
THIS PROPOSAL -- GIVEN THE LARGE

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:43.771
INCREASE AND CBT PROGRAMS OF THE

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.974
CUT CLASSROOMS THE MEDICAL STAFF

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.309
WHICH WOULD NEED SPACE -- AS

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:52.714
WELL AS TREATMENT FOR THE NET.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.382
AND MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION --

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:55.016
THERE ALSO POTENTIAL

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.886
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES -- AS

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.287
HAS BEEN NOTED PREVIOUSLY THAT

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:00.922
WAS THESE MEDICAL POSITIONS CAN

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.390
BE DIFFICULT TO FILL THIS WOULD

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.292
BE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:06.094
NUMBER OF POSITIONS -- MORE OF

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.795
OUR IT IS UNCLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:09.597
THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE AT LINKING

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.299
INDIVIDUALS TO CARE IN THE

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.568
COMMUNITY.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.136
WE NOTE THAT IN THE PROPOSAL IT

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:17.038
MENTIONS AT FIFTY SIX COUNTIES

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:17.972
HAVE.

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:19.707
IMPLEMENTED DIEM CODIS WHICH

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.342
WOULD EXPAND THE TREATMENT IN

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:22.577
THE COMMUNITY HAVE ACCOUNTS ARE

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:23.912
VERY STAGED IMPLEMENTATION AND

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:25.246
DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.447
HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:29.284
SUGGESTS THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.486
FORTY AND NOT.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:32.153
FIFTY SIX WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.789
ONLY STATE THAT HAS A STATEWIDE

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.024
M. A. T. PROGRAMS.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.358
HAS GONE AROUND THIS

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:38.760
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE BY HAVING

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:39.827
THE SAME PROVIDER PROVIDE

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.462
SERVICES IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AS

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.997
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.232
AND SO WHAT THAT PROGRAM HAS

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.700
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.502
OVERDOSE DEATHS NOT SURE HOW THE

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:48.369
MORE COMPLICATED NATURE NOT BE

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.071
NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:53.741
WOULD BE AT LINKING THESE

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:57.478
OFFENDERS TO SERVICES.

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:58.413
FINALLY THERE'S ALSO THIS

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.314
PROGRAM WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.548
INCREASE TO THE COGNITIVE

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.417
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS IT

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.419
WOULD BE REPLACING THE EXISTING

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.821
CONTRACTS WITH NEW CONTRACTS IN

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:10.458
NEW CURRICULA -- ADDED.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.426
WOOD BEES THERE'S ACTUALLY

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:12.427
INCREASING THE SIZE TO TREAT A

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.928
LARGER POPULATION.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.263
WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE SAME

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:18.866
PROGRAMS AT A RECENT AUDIT FOUND --

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.368
MORE NOT EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.569
RECIDIVISM.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:22.670
WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:23.805
PROPOSAL CONTAINS SUFFICIENT

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.207
RESOURCES TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:27.742
OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:28.876
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LARGE

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.044
INCREASE.

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:32.046
WE ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:33.815
PROPOSAL IT MENTIONS THAT SOME

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.016
OF THAT CONTRACT STOP FOR

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.618
ACTUALLY BRINGING IN CONTRABAND

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.453
AND DRUGS.

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:39.487
INTO THE PRISONS AND SO IT'S

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:40.488
UNCLEAR IF THAT COULD ACTUALLY

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.991
HAVE IT FOR THEIR ISSUE.

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:44.959
AS SUCH DO THE UNTESTED IN HR WE

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.561
RECOMMEND ADOPTING THIS OUT AS A

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.663
PILOT -- STARTING WITH THE THREE

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.832
FACILITIES THAT HAVE CORD AND

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:53.935
EIGHTY PILOTS IN PROGRESS.

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:54.769
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE PILOT

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:56.337
INCLUDE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.372
CONTRACTORS FOLLOW BEST

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.340
PRACTICES AND INDEPENDENT

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:01.175
EVALUATION BY RESEARCHERS TO

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:02.443
DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:03.478
PROGRAM ON SUBSTANCE USE IN

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:03.878
PRISONS.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.747
INMATE HEALTH AND OFFENDER

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.348

RECIDIVISM AN OVERDOSE DEATHS.

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:11.386
BASED ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.888
ESTIMATES WE AT ESTIMATE THAT

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:14.989
APPLAUDED SIZE WOULD COST ABOUT

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:17.258
TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN.

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:17.792
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:18.893
UNLIKELY TO EXCEED TWENTY

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.194
MILLION DOLLARS AT FULL

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:22.130
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:23.564
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.366
IMPLEMENT STATEWIDE RATHER THAN

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.968
DOING A PILOT WE RECOMMEND

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:29.203
MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS REQUIRING

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.972
A MORE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:32.774

SEA TO SEA ON THE RECEIVE OUR ON

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:34.709
THE PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTATION

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:35.810
COSTS.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.745
AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION ONCE A

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.580
PROGRAM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:44.986
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:50.124
DONE.

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:51.559
BY A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.568
I'M WONDERING WHAT THE REACTION

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.670
WOULD BE TO A PILOT AND IF WE

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.338
WERE TO OPT TO DO A PILOT.

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:07.108
WHAT -- EITHER WHAT NUMBER OF

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:11.345
FACILITIES I MEAN.

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.747
I APPRECIATE ALEJO'S

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:16.551
RECOMMENDATION THOUGH IT SEEMED --

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.920
I WON'T SAY ARBITRARY BUT THERE

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:19.987
THERE WAS A LITTLE JUSTIFICATION

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:22.757
AS TO WHICH WHY THE CHOICE OF

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.525
THE FACILITIES THAT THE LA

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:26.994
ALWAYS -- INDICATING AND WHY

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.996
ONLY THREE SO I GUESS SOMEONE A

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.232
REACTION TO IF WE WERE TO OPT TO

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:34.502
DO A PILOT ONLY WHAT FACILITIES

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:35.937
WOULD BE RECOMMENDED AND HOW

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.072
MANY.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.208
MADAM CHAIR ON THE QUESTION OF

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:43.444
OF A PILOT -- I GUESS SEVERAL

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.747
REACTIONS -- THE THE REAL

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:47.915
VISIONARY HERE IN THE ROOM ON

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.851
THIS TOPIC.

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.018
BUT YOU'LL SENATOR BELL.

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:56.190
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT --

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.625
TO BE NICE TO HIM -- EVER

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:01.295
NOTICED ME I'VE NEVER BEEN NICE

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:02.730
REFERRAL [inaudible]

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:06.200
THE NO ALL THIS IS ACTION.

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.568
I THOUGHT I ALREADY HAD YOUR

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:10.004
VOTE WITH DOLE BIGELOW BOLD --

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:14.242
THE THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT HE

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:17.345
SAID [inaudible]

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:19.647
AS SENATOR.

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:23.284
CONSERVATIVE SENATOR MEL --

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.019
ENCOURAGED WITH GREAT UNTIL

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.587
NATIONALLY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:29.757
A PILOT. FIVE YEARS AGO -- ONE

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:30.892
MIGHT SAY HE BROWBEAT THE

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:31.793
DEPARTMENT IN ME INTO DOING A

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.594
PILOT.

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.296
SO THE IDEA OF DOING A PILOT.

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.832
WE'VE ALREADY DONE A PILOT --

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:39.200
WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THAT

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.067
WILL BE REPORTING THE

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:42.036
LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:46.174
THAT -- IN THE SAUDIS IT WAS AT

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.643
THREE FACILITY AS WELL TO SEE I

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:50.444
AM TO SEE I DON'T.

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.280
AND A HOUSE OUT OF AN ASSET OF

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:53.414
SO WE'RE INTO A THIRD SO WE WE

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.683
WE ACTUALLY ALREADY I HAVE SOME

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.450
SENSE.

01:30:56.517 --> 01:31:01.622
OF THE EFFICACY OF OF THE BASIC

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:04.392
TREATMENT PROGRAM -- AND THE

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.359
PROGRAM THAT WE ARE NOW OFFERING

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:08.396
IS BUILT UPON OUR SUCCESS THERE.

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:10.832
THE THE SECOND POINT -- DOING A

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:12.500
PILOT HERE.

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:15.670
DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:18.472
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT A

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:21.108
PATIENTS IN EVERY FACILITY.

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.643
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DO A PILOT

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.946
WE'RE GONNA LEARN MUCH ABOUT HOW

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.714
TO DO THIS SYSTEM WIDE.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.350
WE NEED TO ACTUALLY.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:31.886
DO THIS SYSTEM WIDE MUCH IN THE

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.188
SAME WAY THAT WE DID HABSI --

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:36.190
BECAUSE THE PATIENTS -- WILL THE

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:38.192
GOAL HERE IS TO ANY PATIENT WHO

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:40.094
IS ON THE ALREADY THIS TREATMENT

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.263
REGIMEN -- WE NEED TO KEEP THEM

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.431
ALL.

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.966
WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFTER

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.868
THEY GO THROUGH OUR RECEIVING A

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:47.768
RECEPTION THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:49.103
SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.471
DEPARTMENT.

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.106
WE NEED TO BE ABLE.

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:54.175
TO PROVIDE THEM TREATMENT WHERE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:57.545
THEY ARE -- I THINK THE THIRD

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.981
POINT -- IS.

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:03.317
THERE'S AN URGENCY HERE -- THAT

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.753
SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE PILOTS

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.088
THE WRONG RESPONSE.

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.990
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:11.125
FROM OVERDOSE IN THE COUNTRY AND

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.126
OUR PRISONS COMPARED TO OTHER

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.961
PRISONS.

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:16.664
THIS LAST YEAR WE HAD EIGHT

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:18.432
HUNDRED TRIPS TO THE EMERGENCY

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:20.401
ROOM FOR OVER THOSE.

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.603
AND THIS IS A SPIKE FROM SAY TWO

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.705
YEARS AGO.

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:27.408
SO YOU KNOW WHEN I DO A PILOT.

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.210
WELL OKAY WE DO A PILOT WE COME

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.112
BACK IN THREE YEARS WITH THE

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:33.114
RESULTS OF THAT -- YOU YOU'RE

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.216
DOWN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS ON A

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.585
PROBLEM THAT IS STARING US IN

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.320
THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.454
AND I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM OF

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:41.856
SUFFICIENT DIMENSION THAT IT

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:43.257
CALLS.

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:44.592
FOR AN IMMEDIATE.

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:47.862
RESPONSE OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.430
OF THOSE BEING PROPOSED.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:51.899
NO QUESTION I AGREE WITH THE LA

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.000
OWES COMMENTS THEN THERE'S

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.969
UNCERTAINTY A GREAT DEAL OF

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.637
UNCERTAINTY.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.806
WELL THERE'S UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:01.008
WHAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS PROGRAM

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.176
AT ALL.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:04.045
IN THE PRISONS.

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:06.247
SO NATURALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:07.615
SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT.

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:10.785
LEVEL OF CERTAIN EXPENDITURES.

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.586
WELL AL I CAN PROMISES THAT AS

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:14.522
WE HAVE DONE WITH EVERY PROGRAM

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:18.125
WE'VE -- INITIATED -- BUT WE ARE

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.695
GOING TO BE CONSCIOUS OF OF THE

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:22.663
CITY EXPENDITURES OF THIS IS

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:23.965
PUBLIC MONEY.

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:25.333
OTHER WE NEED TO WORK AS HARD AS

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:28.536
<u>E CAN TO GET THE EXPENSES OF</u>

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.338
THE PHARMACEUTICALS DOWN. TO

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:31.973
MAKE SURE THAT THE HIRING THAT

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:34.041
WE DO WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:36.644
THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE HIRE ARE

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:39.647
PROPERLY -- A MONITORED AND

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:42.249
SUPERVISED.

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:43.484
SO YOU KNOW THE THE I THINK THE

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:46.554
RESPONSE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.155
THE UNCERTAINTY ARGUMENT IS.

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.323
LIVE RECEIVERSHIP OVER THE LAST

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.358
TEN YEARS HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.193
JOB OF IMPLEMENTING A LEVELING

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.394
OUT.

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.962
BIG CHANGES.

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:56.330
AND I THINK THIS IS SIMPLY GOING

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:57.765
TO BE ANOTHER CASE FOR WILL BE

01:33:57.832 --> 01:34:00.234
ABLE TO DO THAT -- FINALLY WITH

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:03.404
RESPECT TO THE C. B. T. M.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.373
SUPERVISION ACTUALLY WILL BE

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:06.540
FINALLY I HAVE ONE MORE FINALLY.

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.809
A BRITISH BACK -- TO IS A

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:11.145
MONITORING OF THAT FUNCTION

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:13.414
WITHIN CDC ARE -- I DON'T THINK

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.048
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:16.450
EXTERNAL MONITORING OR SPECIAL

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:17.752
MONITORING.

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.719
ON THE SECRETARY DEALS AND I

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:22.757
HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO HAVE --

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.592
A STEERING COMMITTEE.

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:30.998
OF AB ESSENTIALLY OUR LEVEL.

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:32.533
IN A FEW BELOW -- THAT'S GOING

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.634
TO BE MEETING ROUTINELY UP TO

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:35.436
MONITOR AND TRACK PROGRESS A

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:36.604
WE'RE GONNA TREAT THIS VERY MUCH

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.639
AS THOUGH IT WAS A LARGE IT

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:41.208
PROJECT -- THAT REQUIRES THAT

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:44.478
DEGREE HOME OF EXECUTIVE

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:45.880
SUPERVISION AND MONITORING.

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:48.115
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT CDC ARE

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:49.683
OVER THE LAST DECADE.

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:54.121
HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.589
LARGE IT PROJECTS.

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.690
BOTH FARMS IN THE ELECTRONIC

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:58.292
HEALTH RECORD WERE ENORMOUS

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:01.662
PROJECTS THAT REPLACED.

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.164
I IN THE CASE OF PHAM SOME

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.066
EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY DIFFERENT IT

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:08.769
SYSTEMS WITH ONE SYSTEM. TO

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.638
TRACK OF VENDORS.

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.206
AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:13.574
SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:14.975
ACTUALLY IS IN A GOOD POSITION

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.878
TO SAY WE WE CAN DO THIS TYPE OF

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:20.214
LARGE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.349
FINAL COMMENT -- IN TERMS OF

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.785
EXTERNAL EVALUATION -- I DON'T

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.021
MIND EXTERNAL EVALUATION I DO

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.323
WONDER WHETHER WE REALLY NEED.

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.725
OF THE RECEIVERSHIP HAS BEEN AS

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:34.261
OPEN AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:36.197
ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE WITH OUR

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.299
DASHBOARDS ARE REPORTS.

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:40.101
I THINK WE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:42.103
TO EVALUATE -- OUR PERFORMANCE

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.170
OURSELVES.

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:46.674
IF THE PERFORMANCE IS BAD.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.476
WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:49.009
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HIDING

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:51.745
ANYTHING -- AND TO SOME EXTENT

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:55.449
EXTERNAL EVALUATION IS JUST IT

01:35:55.516 --> 01:36:00.221
ADDS ANOTHER COMPLICATION -- THE

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:02.857
ARE FRANKLY WE COULD DO WITHOUT.

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.892
BUT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS --

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:09.830
THE YOU MENTION THAT WE HAVE THE

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:12.766
HIGHEST OVERDOSE RATE OF IN THE

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:15.503
STATE PRISON SYSTEM NOW IT UP

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.504
RIGHT FACTORED SKEWS ME.

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.539
DEATHS FROM OVERDOSE YES FROM

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:22.076
OVERDOSE OKAY NOW IS THAT

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:23.811
FACTORED -- OUR POPULATION SINCE

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.579
WE ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:28.115
POPULATION IS THAT ARE YOU MEAN

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.383
THE RATE IN SO YET FACTORS IN

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.152
THE POPULATION THE RATE IS ABOUT

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:32.653
THREE TIMES WHAT THE AVERAGE

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.320
RADIOS.

01:36:33.387 --> 01:36:35.289
IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:39.026
AROUND THE COUNTRY -- AND YET.

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:42.096
AWAY -- I THINK -- YOUR COMMENTS

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:43.664
WERE THAT THERE'S NOT OTHER

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.666
STATE PRISONS DOING MEDICALLY

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.334
ASSISTED TREATMENT.

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:51.906
THERE ARE VERY FEW -- YOU KNOW

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:54.942
WHAT'S ON ISLAND.

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.544
THE WORLD ISLAND.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.345
MASSACHUSETTS BUT THOSE ARE THE

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:58.913
STATE'S WEARING YELLOW RHODE

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.548
ISLAND THEIR ENTIRE STATE

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.216
FACILITY IS ONE BUILDING -- IT'S

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:03.083
A LITTLE EASIER FROM THEM -- TO

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.752
DO SOME OF THE COORDINATION WITH

01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:07.121
LOCALS SO BY THE THE CHALLENGE

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:08.088
AREAS.

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:11.058
A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.160
JUST LIKE SOCIETY GENERALLY.

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:16.630
IS WHAT ARE WAY BEHIND THE CURVE.

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.632
ONE ON TREATING THIS RELATIVELY

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:19.600
RECENT.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.669
OF EXPLOSION IN THE OPIOID

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:25.506
EPIDEMIC GIVEN THAT -- THERE'S

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.774
NOT REALLY OTHER THAN TO MEANT

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.509
STATE YOU MENTIONED OTHER STATES

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.377
NECESSARILY USING MEDICALLY

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.279
ASSISTED TREATMENT [inaudible]

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:35.516
WHAT -- WHAT THE EXPLAINS OUR

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:38.953
HIGH DEATHS?

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.020
WELL WE HAVE A LOT MORE THAN

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:41.322
CERTAINLY PART OF IT IS WE HAVE

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:42.556
A LOT MORE DRUGS THAT GET INTO

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.458
OUR PRISONS.

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.926
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE ONLY

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.628
FACTOR BUT AB AND YOUNG DRUGS

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.197
ARE GETTING IN -- THEY'RE BEING

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:51.999
MAILED THEM ON THE BEING BROUGHT

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.500
IN BY VISITORS THEY'RE BEING

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:55.970
BROUGHT IN BY STAFF BOTH CUSTODY

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.404
AND HEALTHCARE.

01:37:57.471 --> 01:37:58.706
THEY'RE BEING DROPPED OVER THE

01:37:58.772 --> 01:38:01.542
FENCE ON IN DRONES.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.277
AND WITH SOME OF THE MORE

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.079
DANGEROUS RECENT -- OR

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:07.414
FORMULATIONS OF FENNEL FOR

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:11.719
EXAMPLE THE OLD TINY SPECKS IS

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.388
ALL YOU NEED -- TO GET INTO THE

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.322
FACILITY.

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:16.957
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.626
WITH A FULL BLOWN WE'RE GONNA

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:21.562
SEARCH EVERYBODY -- IN THE DRUGS

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:24.832
ARE STILL GOING TO GET IN.

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.333
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.001
I'M NO QUESTION IF YOU CAN

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:28.636
REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF DRUGS IN

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:30.537
THE PRISON.

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.373
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING.

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.041
BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.576
EXPERIENCE T SUGGEST THAT.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.911
TRYING TO DO THIS ON THE SUPPLY

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:40.514
SIDE ONLY.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.249
IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK WELL.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.218
WE NEED TO HAVE A DEMAND THE

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:45.753
SOLUTION AND PART OF THE PROBLEM

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:47.388
I RAISE THE ISSUE BECAUSE IF WE

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.523
LOOK AT HOPE YOUR USE OVER THE

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:50.457
COUNTRY.

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:52.926
WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS IN TOTAL

01:38:52.993 --> 01:38:54.428
NUMBERS IT IN THIS IS.

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:57.331
WHETHER IT OUTSIDE OF THE INMATE

01:38:57.398 --> 01:39:00.868
POPULATION [inaudible] FIVE A

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.469
HEART LAW HI TOTAL NUMBER AS

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:04.872
PROPORTION TO THE POPULATION WE

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.874
ARE STILL LOWER THAN MANY OTHER

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.409
STATES MANY OTHER STATES ARE

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:10.544
EXPERIENCING THE OPIOID CRISIS

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.945
FAR GREATER THAN WE ARE.

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:15.349
SO I REYES SAID IN THAT.

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:17.551
YET IT SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:21.388
WITH IN OUR PRISON FACILITY AND

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:23.390
I PARTLY REYES BECAUSE WELL THIS

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:26.060
IS DEALING WITH MEDICALLY SISTER

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.361
TREATMENT [inaudible]

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:32.366
IT -- IF WE SEE OUR NUMBERS.

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.167
OF PEOPLE USING YOUR FOR YOUR

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:35.269
IT'S WITHIN OUR PRISONS INCREASE

01:39:35.336 --> 01:39:37.504
THEN THE COST TO US FOR THIS IS

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:38.806
GOING TO INCREASE.

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:40.941
AND EDITION ONLY MY QUESTION

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:41.642
WOULD BE.

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.745
THE SEMI CONNECTED IS.

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.313
WITH THIS POTENTIALLY LEAD TO

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.215
MORE DRUGS BEING BROUGHT IN

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:48.515
[inaudible]

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:53.987
AND IT'S AN INCREASE IN USAGE.

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:55.255
WELL HAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE ONE

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:59.460
OF THEARM -- ONE THE DATA

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:00.694
ELEMENTS THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.162
MONITORING AND MEASURING FOR

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:03.464
SUCCESS.

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:04.965
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.133
TO HAVE HAPPEN.

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.468
WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:10.003
IS THAT THE NUMBER OF OF INMATES

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:13.374
WHO -- ARE YOU ACTIVELY USING --

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.143
OPIOIDS GOES DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.878
THAT WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED TO

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.279
THEY'RE ABLE TO BE THERE

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:21.482
TREATMENT IS ABLE TO CONTINUE.

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:23.450
MAKING IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.619
WILL THEM -- COME BACK INTO THE

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:28.088
SYSTEM AS PART OF RECIDIVISM.

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:31.091
SO WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.059
WHETHER ON WHAT THE YOU KNOW.

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.894
WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED WHICH

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.596
WOULD BE A BAD SCENARIO A WE

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:36.430
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHETHER

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.865
THAT HAPPENS I DON'T BELIEVE IT

01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:39.299
WILL HAPPEN THE EXPERIENCE SO

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:41.168
FAR AS YOU MENTIONED FOR THREE

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:44.304
YEARS YOU HAPPEN TO TESTING THIS?

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.506
HAS THE NUMBER OF HOPE YOUR

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:49.276
USERS GOING DOWN IN THOSE

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.278
FACILITIES.

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:53.113
A COLLECTION DO YOU KNOW THE

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:53.947
NUMBERS LAST TIME I LOOKED AT

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:54.615
THIS WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO MY

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:55.783
RECOLLECTION IS THAT THE NUMBERS

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.518
HAVE GONE DOWN -- AND I BELIEVE

01:40:57.584 --> 01:41:01.622
ON RECIDIVISM MAY STILL BE TOO

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:02.189
EARLY FOR TELL EARLY IN TWO

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:04.158
SMALL [inaudible]

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.592
FROM.

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:06.593
WE KNOW THAT THE THE INMATES WHO

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.662
HAVE BEEN PART OF THE PROGRAM.

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:09.830
AND WE DO HAVE TO DISTRICT

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.832
SHOWING THAT I THINK IT'S 6270%

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.467
HAVE STAYED ON THE TREATMENT

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.868
PROGRAM.

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:17.504
SO TO THAT EXTENT -- THAT'S BEEN

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:19.173
SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH PROBABLY ALL

01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:20.741
YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE MEASURE

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.142
IN A THREE YEAR PILOT ANYWAY.

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:23.010
A YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:41:23.076 --> 01:41:26.180
SHOW OF OF RECIDIVISM WHERE YOUR

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:29.883
TOTAL -- PILOT POPULATION IS A

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:30.484
HUNDRED HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOU

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:33.053
JUST TALK A SEAT ON IMPACT WITH

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.621
THOSE IN SMALL NUMBERS.

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:35.255
CAN YOU DESCRIBE OTHER IN THIS

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.256
OBVIOUSLY COVERING ALL

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.392
FACILITIES WHAT ABOUT THE

01:41:38.459 --> 01:41:39.226
PROPOSAL THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:41.328
BEFORE US IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:43.163
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE THREE

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.598
FACILITIES THAT YOU ARE

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.200
CURRENTLY USING.

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:50.304
MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT --

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.805
I MAY TURN THE DOCTOR CAME IN

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:52.673
FOR THAT DESCRIPTION GOOD THAT

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:55.042
WILL NOT TO WANT TO MISS STATE --

01:41:55.108 --> 01:41:57.511
ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM.

01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.179
YEAH NO I THINK THIS IS A A MUCH

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.814
MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.182
WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.383
THE THREE BIG PATIENT

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.519
POPULATIONS THAT ARE AT THE

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:08.188
HIGHEST RISK. FOR DEATH AND SO

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:10.157
WHAT WE'D BE DOING IS CONTINUING

01:42:10.224 --> 01:42:12.326
PATIENTS ON MEDICATION ASSISTED

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:14.328
TREATMENT AS THEY COME FROM THE

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:16.930
THE COUNTY JAILS -- WERE ALSO

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:18.899
HAVE A DEVELOPER VERY ROBUST

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.702
PROCESS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS.

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:24.204
WHO ARE CURRENTLY WITH US PAGE

01:42:24.271 --> 01:42:26.106
FIFTEEN OF YOUR?

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:27.741
AT THE BOTTOM CONTINUE.

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.576
THE SECOND GROUP OF PATIENTS ARE

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:31.345
REALLY THE THE FOLKS WHO HAVE

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.046
ALREADY DECLARED THEMSELVES AT

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:35.482
HIGH RISK -- WHO HAVE OVERDOSED

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.017
AT LEAST ONCE?

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:39.853
I ON ON A ON A DRUG.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.555
OR HAVE SOME OTHER COMPLICATION

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:43.423
RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.626
DISORDER -- SORT SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.494
WE SEE SPINAL ABSCESSES OR

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.529
INFECTIONS OF THE HEART

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:49.863
ENDOCARDITIS.

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:51.698
AND THEN THE THIRD GROUP THAT'S

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:53.834
THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT AND THE

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:55.369
THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS WE'RE

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.837
GOING TO BE FOCUSING.

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:58.972
ON THE PATIENTS WHO ARE LEADING

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:01.375
US IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:02.676
EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:03.911
OUR GONNA DO.

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.679
SCREENING ON EVERYONE OF THOSE

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:07.714
PATIENTS LEAVING IF THEY SCREEN

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:09.716
POSITIVE WILL BE DOING OF KIND

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.285
OF A RISK ASSESSMENT FROM A

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.819
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.422
AND BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT IF

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:19.927
THEY'RE MODERATE TO HIGH RISK --

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:21.828
WE WILL -- DETERMINE THEIR

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:22.462
TREATMENT NEEDS USING THE A SAM

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:24.131
CRY TERRY THIS IS THE COMMUNITY

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:27.000
A STANDARD IF YOU WILL -- TO

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:27.801
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:32.039
pI'M SORRY INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:33.206
OR OUTPATIENT.

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:34.708
I AND THEN WE WILL START THEM ON

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:36.610
A TREATMENT REGIMENT IF THEY'RE

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:37.678
APPROPRIATE FOR MEDICATION

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:39.079
ASSISTED TREATMENT WILL START

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.581
THEM ON THE MEDICATION ASSISTED

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:41.782
TREATMENT.

01:43:41.848 --> 01:43:44.818
AND REFER THEM TO TO D. R. P.

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.253
FOR A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL THERAPY

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.287
AND THEY'LL RECEIVE THAT

I THINK IF THE ISSUE WERE PUSHED

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.919
REFER THE COURT THE COURT WOULD

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.721
HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:04.791
IN NOT DIRECTING ME. TO

01:51:04.858 --> 01:51:07.260
IMPLEMENT SUCH A PROGRAM.

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:08.928
BUT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING NOW IS

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:11.531
JUST MY LEGAL CONCLUSION MIKE

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:13.800
GAS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.135
THIS WERE LITIGATED.

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:18.204
UNFORTUNATELY IN MY JUDGMENT OF

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:19.606
THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:21.041
THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM WE SHOULD

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.742
DO IT.

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.244
AND IT MAY BE THE

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.545
ADMINISTRATION'S DECIDED WELL

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:26.913
BECAUSE THEY AGREE WITH SORT OF

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.416
AT LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT IN FACT.

01:51:29.482 --> 01:51:31.885
THIS IS A MEDICAL ILLNESS YOU

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:33.553
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.088
REQUIREMENT TO TREATED.

01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:36.523
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO SPEAK

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:38.024
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:40.060
JUSTIFICATION I'M JUST DELIGHTED

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:40.894
TO SEE YOU.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.462
I AM ON THE BUDGET AT THIS POINT

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:44.097
WHAT'S MORE OF A PROACTIVE

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:45.799
POSTURE AS AND WITH THAT YOU'RE

01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:48.535
SUPPORTING AS OPPOSED TO HAVING.

01:51:48.601 --> 01:51:50.303
TO HAVE US BEREACTIVE BY A

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.405
FEDERAL JUDGE HE I THINK THAT'S

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:54.207
A VERY FAIR WHERE I'M DESCRIBING

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:59.179
AN END SIMPLY MY REACTION -- TO

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:01.281
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS -- THAT I

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:01.815
THINK CAN BE AVOIDED BY

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.483
IMPLEMENTING THIS TYPE OF A

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:06.119
PROGRAM AND I KNOW SOMETIMES

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:07.954
DEATHS OF INMATES -- AND THE

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.823
FACT THAT EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:12.092
ARE HAVING OVERDOSES SOME PEOPLE

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:13.226
MAY NOT VIEW THAT.

01:52:13.293 --> 01:52:15.562
WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY.

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:18.231
BUT I AM REQUIRED TO VIEW THAT

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.500
WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY WE HAVE

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.235
REDUCED AFFORDABLE DEATHS.

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:25.772
IN EVERY OTHER CATEGORY.

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:28.141
THIS ONE NOW -- IT POPS UP AND

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:29.876
SO I DO FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:33.012
ABOUT RESPONDING TO THIS CRISIS.

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:34.647
WAS A LAY PERSON I WOULD SEE A

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:38.985
PRISON AS A LARGE DETOX CENTER.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.920
AS OVER A MUCH IN THE SAME WAY

01:52:40.987 --> 01:52:44.858
THAT -- IN THE PRISONS ARE NOW

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:45.458
WERE YOU PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:45.758
TREATMENT.

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:48.161
BUT IT IT BE GREAT TO HAVE DETOX

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.396
IN A A LITTLE OF A TREATMENT BUT

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:51.965
AS LONG TERM.

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.266
SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:54.501
THEY CAN CONTINUE ON THAT

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.703
TREATMENT WAS NOT JUST DETOX IS

01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.905
ACTUALLY LONG TERM CHRONIC

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:02.375
TREATMENT -- HOPEFULLY IN THE

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.177
END OF BEING ONE REASON WHY

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.446
MAYBE THAT PERSON CAN BE

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:09.249
SUCCESSFUL ON THE OUTSIDE.

01:53:09.315 --> 01:53:12.252
SO IF I GET CANCER WHILE I'M IN

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.287
PRISON THAT'S ONE THING BUT IF I

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:16.189
CHOOSE TO TAKE DRUGS.

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:17.257
PATTERSON AGAIN THAT'S ALL

01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:20.026
THAT'S A SELF CHOICE I HAVE NOW.

01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:21.594
CREATED A HEALTH PROBLEM.

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:23.796
AT MY CHOICE.

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:25.999
DO I THEN BECOME RESPONSIBLE TO

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:28.268
PAY FOR THE DRUGS SAID YOU'RE

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.170
GOING TO GIVE ME TO OFFSET.

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:31.538
THAT DO I HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:32.939
RESPONSIBLE TO REIMBURSE TO

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:35.074
TAXPAYERS OR IS ADDICTION

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:36.376
CONSIDERED.

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:38.077
AN ILLNESS AND THEREFORE THE

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:39.279
EVERYTHING IS KICK THIS PAID FOR

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:42.882
FOR FREE ADDICTION IS CONSIDERED --

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:45.018
MOVED TO BE AN ILLNESS IN MUCH

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:48.054
THE SAME WAY AS DIABETES.

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:50.390
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE ARE

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:53.927
DIABETICS I HAVE MADE A CHOICE.

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.295
THEY EAT TOO MUCH SUGAR.

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:58.164
THEY DON'T EXERCISE.

01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:00.033
OF SO WELL WILL WIRE WHY DON'T

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:01.034
THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.335
DIABETIC TREATMENT WELL THAT'S

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:04.804
NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE FREE

01:54:04.871 --> 01:54:07.674
WORLD EITHER -- YOU.

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:10.810
DIABETIC COMES TO A DOCTOR NEEDS

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.345
MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREAT.

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:14.080
THIS IS THIS IS VERY MUCH BUTTE

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:17.217
AT THIS POINT AS SIMILAR TO THAT.

01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:18.384
OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE SORT OF

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:21.688
AN ADDICTION ACTUALLY HANDLES OF

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:23.122
CHEMICAL CHANGES.

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:24.791
IN THEIR BRAIN.

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:27.093
THAT ADDICTS THEM THAT MAKES THE

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.063
CRAVING FOR THE DRUG WAS.

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:31.798
ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE.

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:34.934
NOT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY BUT IN

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.369
SOMEWHAT THE SAME WAY THAT I'VE

01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:37.870
GOT A CRAVING FOR THAT NEXT

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:41.507
CANDY BAR -- THOUGH IT IS VIEWED

01:54:41.574 --> 01:54:42.775
AS A MEDICAL ILLNESS.

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:44.510
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ASK

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:46.512

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:55.722
WHAT I WANTED -- TO REYES. FIVE

01:54:55.788 --> 01:54:57.457
THE CLARIFICATION OF ITS

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:58.858
ADMINISTRATIVE PROPOSAL.

01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:01.661
I'M WE THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.329
APPROVING OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:06.866
OF YEARS INCREASING ALLOCATIONS.

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:09.002
FOR I'M WILL CALL INTERDICTING

01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:11.971
OR WHERE FOR NOTES THAT ANYWAY

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:13.172
TRYING TO KEEP THE DRUGS OUT.

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:15.174
AND IT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.876
MONEY.

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:19.479
AND YET EVEN WITH OUR INCREASES

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:22.282
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE WE

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:24.417
HAVE AMPED UP. FIVE DRUG

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:27.754
SNIFFING DOG SCREENINGS --

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.622
SEARCHES A WHOLE VARIETY OF

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:32.392
THINGS WE ARE SEEING.

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:34.027
THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE AN

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:36.896
OVERDOSE DEATHS SO.

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:39.032
DO YOU KNOW ONE WOULD HAVE TO

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:39.966
SAY.

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:42.235
THAT SO FAR ARE EXPENDITURES ON

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.037
TRYING TO PREVENT THE DRUGS FROM

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:45.405
COMING IN.

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.974
HAVE YOU MET MAYBE IF WE HAD

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:49.309
NONE OF FOR THEM WE DO HAVE

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:51.044
WRITTEN MORE OVERDOSES BUT THERE

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.912
ISN'T THAT A GREAT CORRELATION

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:55.715
BETWEEN OUR EXPENDITURES IN

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.416
TRYING TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:57.450
COMING IN.

01:55:57.517 --> 01:56:00.520
AND A REDUCTION IN OVERDOSES AN

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:02.488
OVERDOSE DEATHS.

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:04.791
SO -- HI I THINK IT IS

01:56:04.857 --> 01:56:09.962
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO LOOK AT I

01:56:10.029 --> 01:56:11.631
MEAN IT IT.

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:13.466
IT MAKES NO SENSE ON THE ONE

01:56:13.533 --> 01:56:14.901
HAND THAT.

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:16.436
PEOPLE WOULD OVERDOSE IMPRISONED

01:56:16.502 --> 01:56:18.371
AND YET THAT IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:24.677
WE HALF -- SO AS I THINK FOR FOR

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:26.579
ME THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.147
EXPENDITURE.

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:31.684
IT'S THERE ARE WHAT APPEARS.

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:33.920
AND CLEARLY STAFF CAN TALK MORE

01:56:33.986 --> 01:56:35.888
TO THE RECEIVER NUMBERS OR TO

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.090
THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:39.425
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LA OWES --

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:42.862
WHAT THE HIGHLIGHTED REGARDING --

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.263
THE FIVE MILLION.

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:46.666
FOUR I NALOXONE FOR THOSE WHO

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.568
ARE BEING RELEASED AS MAY BE --

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.603
A NUMBER THAT COULD BE ADJUSTED

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:52.372
CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE BY

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:56.175
THEIR OWN ESTIMATES ONLY -- FOUR

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.543
THOUSAND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.212
PEOPLE BEING RELEASED EACH YEAR

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:01.080
SO BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF

01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:02.515
THINGS LIKE THAT I WANNA HOLD IT

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.117
OPEN I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:06.185
OF TIME. TO GET SOME OF THIS

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:08.588
NAIL DOWN BUT CLEARLY I THINK WE

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:10.123
DO WANT TO GET IT NAILED DOWN

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:13.593
BEFORE WE WOULD -- ACT.

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:15.194
UGH BUT THE FINAL QUESTION I

01:57:15.261 --> 01:57:18.631
WOULD HAVE -- BEFORE WE JUST

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:19.432
HOLD IT OPEN.

01:57:19.499 --> 01:57:21.868
IS HOW CAN WE ENSURE I MEAN

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:24.537
THERE'S YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:26.672
THAT CAN FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:28.508
ONCE THE RELEASED.

01:57:28.574 --> 01:57:31.144
AND THAT'S WHAT THE NLOXONE

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:33.212
DOSES ARE.

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:33.946
FOR GIVING PEOPLE WHEN THEY

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:37.216
LEAVE BUT WHAT IN WHAT WAYS THIS

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:40.219
IS KIND OF PREDICATED ON THAT

01:57:40.286 --> 01:57:43.122
ONCE THE PERSON IS RELEASED THAT

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:44.090
THERE.

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:45.858
THERE ARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:47.794
WOULD CONTINUE TO BE TREATED SO

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:51.063
IN WHAT WAYS DO IS THIS.

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:53.332
PROGRAM ENSURING THAT.

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:54.000
IF AT ALL.

01:57:54.066 --> 01:57:55.067
I THINK DOCTOR KING INCOMES BE

01:57:55.134 --> 01:57:57.437
TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN ONE

01:57:57.503 --> 01:58:00.239
OF OUR BIGGEST FOCUSES AS HOW WE

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:02.141
COORDINATE THIS WITH LOCAL

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:03.176
PROVIDERS.

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:04.777
PARTICULARLY IN THOSE FIRST TWO

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:07.013
WEEKS SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:09.215
CONNECTION MADE WHEN THEM AT

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:09.749
THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOUR

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:12.585
PATERNAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ON

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:14.554
THE THE PATIENT AND LOCAL

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.957
PROVIDERS BUT DR GAININGCAM

01:58:18.024 --> 01:58:19.459
EXPLAIN WHERE WE ARE ON THAT.

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:20.860
YES AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THE

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.295
RESOURCES THAT WE REQUESTED

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:23.396
PARTICULARLY THE NURSING

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:25.364
RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE SOCIAL

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.766
WORKER OUT RESOURCES.

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.367
A VERY SPECIFICALLY ARE

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:30.636
TARGETING -- PATIENTS WHO ARE

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:31.804
LEAVING BOTH ON COMMUNITY

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:33.840
SUPERVISION AND A SUBSET OF

01:58:33.906 --> 01:58:35.708
THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE LEAVING

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:39.111
THROUGH PAROLE -- TO WORK WITH

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:41.080
THE COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND TO

01:58:41.147 --> 01:58:42.949
GET THOSE PATIENTS CONNECTED TO

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:45.017
THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENTS ALONG

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:47.053
WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES THE

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:48.754
WRAPAROUND SOCIAL SERVICES.

01:58:48.821 --> 01:58:52.492
I WILL SAY THAT -- AGAIN IN OUR

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:54.193
PILOT THE TWO PILOTS

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.862
INSTITUTIONS ONE OF THE REALLY

01:58:55.928 --> 01:58:57.830
BIG SUCCESS STORIES PROBABLY THE

01:58:57.897 --> 01:58:59.198
MOST IMPORTANT.

01:58:59.265 --> 01:59:02.268
LESSON LEARNED FROM THOSE PILOTS

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.403
IS THAN US JUST USING A SMALL

01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:05.905
NUMBER OF SOCIALWORKERS WITH

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:07.073
THE ADDICTION SPECIALIST

01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:08.508
DEVELOPING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:10.376
OUT IN THE COUNTIES.

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:14.280
WE WERE ABLE TO GET -- ALMOST

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.182
80% OF OUR PATIENTS CONNECTED TO

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:18.017
COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND THOSE

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:21.287
FIRST APPOINTMENTS AND THAT IS.

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.622
THREE TO FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:25.725
WE SEE -- WITHOUT THOSE --

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:27.727
TRANSITION RESOURCES REALLY

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:29.562
HELPING THAT PERSON HAND OVER

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:31.864
HAND MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO --

01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:33.733
WE DO A VERY POOR JOB QUITE

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:36.569
FRANKLY -- BUT WITH THESE PILOTS

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:38.070
AND THAT MODEL WHERE WE HAVE A

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:40.339
SOCIAL WORKER THE NURSES AND THE

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.375
ADDICTION SPECIALIST -- WE DID

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:43.709
CONNECT THOSE PATIENTS AT IN

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:47.346
ABOUT 76% WHICH IS VERY VERY

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:49.682
HIGH.

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:51.017
RIGHT SO BEFORE A ASK FOR PUBLIC

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.652
COMMENT IS THERE ANY OTHER

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.220
COMMON OR QUESTIONS BY

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.621
DEPARTMENT FINANCE CáC C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:59:55.688 --> 01:59:56.722
COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:58.324

THE DEATH RATE HAS INCREASED

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:04.830
SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S AN

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:07.700
IMPORTANT FACTOR INTO HOW WE

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.901
RECOGNIZE WHERE ADDITIONAL

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:12.738
RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED -- I

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:13.539
THINK THE RECEIVERS.

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:15.007
FOCUS ON THIS PROGRAM IS

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:16.175
DEFINITELY NECESSARY GIVEN THE

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:18.077

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:20.646
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GENERALLY SO

IN APPEARANCE OF MAYBE EXPANSION

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:26.152

RELATED TO CDC ARE PROPER AND I

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:39.699

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:42.301
IMPORTANT RESOURCES TO MAKING AN

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:43.469

WITH THE ATTORNEYS AND THAT WAS

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:58.303

PLAINTIFFS AND SO.

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:06.111
TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE THROUGH

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:07.946
THE CLAIMS BILL PROCESS -- AND

02:08:08.013 --> 02:08:09.448
SO THESE TYPES OF CASES ARE PAID

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:10.983
THROUGH THAT CLAIM SO PROCESS

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:14.520
BECAUSE THESE PAYMENTS ARE DUE --

02:08:14.586 --> 02:08:15.354

THIS BUT THESE THESE PAYMENTS

02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:19.725
ARE DUE PROBABLY EARLIER THAN

PUT INTO THE BUDGET -- THE MAY

02:08:30.269 --> 02:08:31.437
REVIVE I GUESS CHRIS THAT THE

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:32.905
QUESTION IS DOES IT COME OUT OF

02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:35.007
THE DOJ'S BUDGET.

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:37.810

ARE THESE ARE TYPICALLY PAID --

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:41.480
FROM A GENERAL FUND

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:44.249
APPROPRIATION OR OTHER SPECIAL

02:08:44.316 --> 02:08:45.384
FUNDS IN THE CLAIMS BILL PROCESS

02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:47.252
BUT THERE'S A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:55.527
ON THAT BUDGETS ITS CLAIMS.

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:58.230
THERE'S A YOU WANNA.

WHEN IT GOES THROUGH IT'LL SAY

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:02.101
IT IS HEREBY APPROPRIATED TO THE

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:02.768
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PAY FOR

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:04.870
THESE VERY SPECIFIC CLAIMS -- I

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:05.871
THINK THERE WAS JUST ONE THAT

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:07.573
HAPPENED -- THIS PAST COUPLE

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:09.308
MONTHS AGO SB FOUR EIGHTEEN DID

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:10.776
VERY SIMILAR THING WHENEVER

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:11.577
THERE'S SETTLEMENTS AGAINST THE

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:12.211
STATE.

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:13.946
IT'S TYPICALLY PAY FOR OUT OF

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.180
DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM A

02:09:15.247 --> 02:09:17.015
CLAIMS BELL -- WE DO ALSO

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:17.983
INCLUDE THEM IN THE BUDGET

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:19.184
THOUGH DEPENDING ON THE TIMING

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.452
OF WHEN THEY'RE DO AND THE

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:21.987
TIMING OF WHEN THE CLING STILL

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:23.789
HAPPENS -- AT THE SOURCE OF THE

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:26.425
FUNDS IN THE CLAIMS BILL WOULD

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:29.027
BE -- IT'S I CAN BE IT CAN VERY

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.829
I THINK -- IT CAN BE GENERAL

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:32.531
FUND I THINK MOST COMMONLY IS

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.266
GENERAL FUND BUT DEPENDING ON

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:36.034
I'M AN ACCOUNTANT SO I'M USED TO

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.202
A CHART OF ACCOUNTS.

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:41.607
SO WHAT ACCOUNT IS IT COMING OUT

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:43.442
OF THIS COME OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY.

02:09:43.509 --> 02:09:44.476
ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT IS A THE

02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:45.811
BILL CAME OUT OF THERE.

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:46.745
NOW IT WOULD -- IT WOULD COME

02:09:46.812 --> 02:09:48.380
JUST OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND POT

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:49.348
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE IS

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:50.816
THAT WHATEVER IS IN THE RESERVES

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:51.683
IN THE GENERAL FUND.

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.485
IS WHAT COMES OUT OF ITS NOT

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:54.753
BUDGET OTHER.

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:55.988
YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY BUDGETED

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:58.257
FOR LIKE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS OR

02:09:58.323 --> 02:10:00.392
SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OR ANYTHING

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:02.194
IT'S JUST KIND OF WHAT WE

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:03.061
LEARNED FROM FROM THIS HOW IT

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:04.663
DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN WHERE WE

02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:06.265
DO A BILL AND IT GOES ALL THE

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:07.566
WAY THROUGH AND GETS BEAT UP AT

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:09.668
THE STATE.

02:10:09.735 --> 02:10:10.802
U. S. SUPREME COURT IN THIS CASE.

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:11.370
AND SO NOW WE HAVE TO SPEND

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.071
THREE MILLION.

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.606
FOR IT WOULD HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.308
LEARN FROM THAT BECAUSE AT THAT

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.177
COULD GET EXPENSIVE -- WE DO

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:19.611
THIS ALL THE TIME RIGHT.

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.146
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:23.515
THINK -- THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT

02:10:23.582 --> 02:10:24.349
BE BETTER BECAUSE THEY DO ARE

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:25.717
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT DO

02:10:25.784 --> 02:10:27.152
REPRESENT THE STATE BUT I WILL

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:28.954
SAY THAT CLEANS WHEELS OFF -- TO

02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:29.988
HAPPEN PRETTY OFTEN I MEAN IT IS

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:31.657
TWICE A YEAR WHERE WE HAVE

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:33.392
CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE -- THAT

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:34.493
ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CLAIMS

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.161
BILL USUALLY ONE SPRING ONE IN

02:10:36.228 --> 02:10:38.130
THE FALL -- ANYTHING THERE'S

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:41.166
USUALLY A NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:43.302
BUT DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE.

02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:43.869
YEAH I MEAN JUST ADDED THAT

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:44.503
THERE ARE VARIOUS CLAIMS THAT

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:45.237
COME THROUGH THE THE PROCESS

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:46.672
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- ON ON

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:47.873
VARIOUS MATTERS SOMETIMES IT'S

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:49.841
THAT LEGISLATION -- SOMETIMES

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:51.543
IT'S A LOSS -- DUE TO YOU

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:52.477
NATURAL DISASTER AND THINGS LIKE

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:53.845
THAT SO IT VARIES QUITE A BIT I

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.214
I THINK IT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.415
SINCE WE'VE SEEN ONE LIKE THIS.

02:10:56.481 --> 02:11:01.186

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.160
A MAN THIS IS GOING TO BE

02:11:08.227 --> 02:11:09.895
INTRANSIGENT BUT ABOUT FORTY

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:11.563
MAYBE THEY'LL MAYBE IT WAS

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:12.965
LITTLE -- WHAT WE NEED TO COOK A

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:13.832
LITTLE MORE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW

02:11:13.899 --> 02:11:15.033
YEAH HERE AS IT MOVES THROUGH

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:16.134
THE PROCESS?

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:17.469
AND THEN HERE IS A LIVE YOU KNOW

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:22.474
TO TO TRY TO EXPERIMENT IT GETS

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:24.676
PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND TIME I JUST

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:26.111
WANTED.

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:26.578
TO FIGURE OUT.

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:27.212

WE TRIED THIS AND AND WE LOST

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:33.518
RIGHT.

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:35.087
SO IS IT THE GOVERNOR THAT'S

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.421
LIKE THE BACKSTOP WHICH AT THAT

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:37.856
RELY ON THE GOVERNOR'S VETO FOR

02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:39.324
BILLS LIKE THIS SO THEY DO LIKE

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:40.859
A LEGAL ANALYSIS WHEN THERE'S

02:11:40.926 --> 02:11:41.960

BILLS GO THROUGH -- AND THE

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:45.597
VARIOUS COMMITTEE PROCESS -- BUT

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:46.565
THE CLAIMS BILL I THINK IS A

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:48.433
POLICY WHERE YOU WOULD SEE IT ON

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.901
AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AND AND

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:50.569
SOMEBODY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:52.271
CLAIMS BILL -- AND DOING THE

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:54.039

02:18:52.924 --> 02:18:53.725
PROCEED IN AN OFFICE MY

02:18:53.792 --> 02:18:54.859
QUESTIONS DO YOU LIKE ME AT

02:18:54.926 --> 02:18:55.527
CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LA --

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:56.695
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE OUR

02:18:56.761 --> 02:19:00.031
COMMENTS ON THE WHOLE THING OKAY --

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:01.933
SO REGARDING THE A DAHLE INMATE

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.069
POPULATION AT AS WAS INDICATED

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.870
THE DEPARTMENT PRODUCED TWO SETS

02:19:05.937 --> 02:19:07.639
OF PROJECTIONS FOR THE ADULT AND

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:09.908
MADE POPULATION THIS MAY ONE IS.

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:11.710
A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT JUST BASED

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:13.912
ON HAVING MORE ACTUAL DATA SINCE

02:19:13.978 --> 02:19:15.914
THAT -- JANUARY PROJECTIONS WERE

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:17.615
RELEASED THE SECOND ADDRESS

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:20.185
FURTHER DOWNWARD BASED ON THE

02:19:20.251 --> 02:19:22.220
ANTICIPATED EFFECT OF THE POLICY

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:24.355
CHANGES THAT WERE LISTED -- THE

02:19:24.422 --> 02:19:26.424
BUDGET ADJUSTMENT WAS BASED AS

02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:27.859
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND --

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:30.729
ACCIDENTALLY OFF OF THE FIRST

02:19:30.795 --> 02:19:32.997
SET OF PROJECTION SET SO -- THE

02:19:33.064 --> 02:19:34.899
DEPARTMENT IS WORKING TO UPDATE

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:36.367
THAT BUDGET ADJUSTMENT TO

02:19:36.434 --> 02:19:39.170
INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL DECLINE

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:40.438
THAT'S PROJECTED AS A AS A

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:42.040
RESULT OF THIS THE POLICY

02:19:42.107 --> 02:19:43.174
CHANGES.

02:19:43.241 --> 02:19:44.876
AND SO WE WILL CERTAINLY REVIEW

02:19:44.943 --> 02:19:46.277
THAT BUDGET ADJUSTMENT AND

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:51.449
COMMUNICATE ANY CONCERNS WE

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:53.651
IDENTIFY TO THE COMMITTEE.

02:19:53.718 --> 02:19:54.686
EN WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:55.620
INDICATING IS THAT IN OTHER

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:57.789
WORDS THEY I AM.

02:19:57.856 --> 02:19:58.623
WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:01.292
POPULATION ADJUSTMENT BASED ON?

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:02.494
IT FIGURES.

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.096
AND IT DOES NOT INCORPORATE THE

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.898
THE COURT ACTION IN A COUPLE OF

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:08.233
OTHER ACTIONS THAT WOULD.

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:10.735
UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND A FEW

02:20:10.802 --> 02:20:12.871
OTHER THINGS POTENTIALLY HAVE

02:20:12.937 --> 02:20:15.306
FOLKS WITH EARNING CREDITS BE

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:17.776
ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE.

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:19.878
POTENTIALLY SOONER WHICH MAY

02:20:19.944 --> 02:20:21.679
FURTHER REDUCE THE POPULATION

02:20:21.746 --> 02:20:23.281
THAT CRACKED OKAY.

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:24.315
AND SO WE'RE GONNA.

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:26.317
IN ONE ITEM COMES BACK WE'LL GET

02:20:26.384 --> 02:20:28.086
ADJUSTED NUMBERS.

02:20:28.153 --> 02:20:30.288
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND ONE

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:32.190
OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT IS

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:33.792
NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ON THIS

02:20:33.858 --> 02:20:35.560
NOTE ON THIS TOPIC IS -- WE

02:20:35.627 --> 02:20:36.761
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.530
PASSED STATUTE REQUIRING THE

02:20:38.596 --> 02:20:40.231
DEPARTMENT TO NOTIFY THE

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:41.733
LEGISLATURE AND PROVIDE.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.702
A POPULATION IMPACT ESTIMATES

02:20:44.769 --> 02:20:46.805
WHEN IT MAKES FURTHER CHANGES TO

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.273
ITS CREDIT EARNING REGULATIONS

02:20:48.339 --> 02:20:50.742
AS CHANGES TO CREDIT EARNING CAN

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.210
HAVE AS WE SAW IN THIS CASE

02:20:52.277 --> 02:20:53.444
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:54.746
POPULATION WHICH IS.

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.347
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:20:56.414 --> 02:20:57.982
HAVE AS IT CONSIDERS CCAR'S

02:20:58.049 --> 02:21:01.653
RESOURCE NEEDS AND OTHER RELATED --

02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:03.254
POLICY ISSUES [inaudible]

02:21:03.321 --> 02:21:04.789
OKAY.

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:06.891
AND THEN YOU HAD AS A THING ON A

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:08.059
CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY

02:21:08.126 --> 02:21:10.962
TRANSITIONAL REENTRY YES.

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:12.764
SO WE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:14.732
PROGRAM SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR

02:21:14.799 --> 02:21:16.401
COST EFFECTIVENESS BEFORE IT IS

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:17.802
EXPANDED.

02:21:17.869 --> 02:21:19.370
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:21.706
YOUR P. ARE THE EXPANSION OF C.

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:23.541
C. T. R. P. ACCORDING TO THE

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:25.176
COST ESTIMATES AND THE PROPOSAL

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.911
WOULD BE FIVE TIMES MORE

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:29.747
EXPENSIVE DâN -- ON A ON A PER

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:31.683
INMATE BASIS DAN WHERE THESE

02:21:31.749 --> 02:21:34.219
WOMEN WOULD BE HOUSED UNDER THE

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:36.287
STATUS QUO.

02:21:36.354 --> 02:21:36.988
THIS MEANS THAT CC TO YOUR P.

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:38.857
WOULD NEED TO BE ESSENTIALLY

02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:40.358
MORE THAN FIVE TIMES AS

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.393
EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVIST

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.728
RECIDIVISM RECRUITING OTHER

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:45.563
BENEFITS.

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:46.931
AS A STANDARD PRISON ENVIRONMENT.

02:21:46.998 --> 02:21:49.667
HOWEVER THERE SIMPLY ISN'T -- WE

02:21:49.734 --> 02:21:50.802
A SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HOW

02:21:50.869 --> 02:21:52.904
EFFECTIVE THE CC TEAR P. PROGRAM

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:54.973
IS GIVEN THAT HASN'T BEEN

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:55.573
EVALUATED.

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:58.643
THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED SOME

02:21:58.710 --> 02:22:00.712
DATA INDICATING THAT WOMEN WHO

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.947
PARTICIPATE IN CC TEAR P. ARE

02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:04.382
LESS LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT

02:22:04.449 --> 02:22:05.850
THAN WOMEN WHO DON'T PARTICIPATE

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:08.519
IN CC TEAR HE HOWEVER THAT ISN'T

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:10.088
REALLY AN APPLES TO APPLES

02:22:10.154 --> 02:22:12.257
COMPARISON -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:22:12.323 --> 02:22:14.425
CLEAR WHETHER IT'S THE PROGRAM

02:22:14.492 --> 02:22:15.693
THAT'S RESULTING IN THEM BEING

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.762
LESS LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT OR

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:19.998
IF IT'S SUB SOMETHING TO DO WITH

02:22:20.064 --> 02:22:21.599
HOW THE WOMEN ARE SELECTED INTO

02:22:21.666 --> 02:22:22.901
THE PROGRAM IN OTHER WORDS THAT

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:24.369
THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF NATURALLY

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.604
SELECTING -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:28.573
LESS LIKELY TO RESET DEBATE TO

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:29.908
BEGIN WITH.

02:22:29.974 --> 02:22:31.409
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING

02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:32.577
THAT RESEARCHERS WOULD

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.245
POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO TEASE OUT

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:36.347
IN OTHER WORDS -- BY HAVING

02:22:36.414 --> 02:22:37.815
RESEARCHERS LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:39.517
THEY COULD POTENTIALLY COME UP

02:22:39.584 --> 02:22:41.552
WITH A CREDIBLE -- ESTIMATE

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:43.187
ESSENTIALLY OF HOW EFFECTIVE THE

02:22:43.254 --> 02:22:44.822
PROGRAM IS.

02:22:44.889 --> 02:22:47.158
WHICH WOULD -- BE VERY VALUABLE

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:48.192
FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AS IT

02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:50.995
CONSIDERS POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS --

02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:52.897
SO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT WHETHER

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.132
OR NOT YOU APPROVED THIS

02:22:54.198 --> 02:22:56.067
EXPANSION THAT YOU REQUIRE AN

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:58.236
INDEPENDENT STUDY OF THE

02:22:58.303 --> 02:23:00.471
PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS --

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:02.807
BECAUSE HAVING THIS INFORMATION

02:23:02.874 --> 02:23:05.176
WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE --

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:07.412
TO ASSESS WHETHER AND CONTINUING

02:23:07.478 --> 02:23:09.314
TO INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM -- IS

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:10.982
ALLOWING IT TO ESSENTIALLY

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:14.285
PREVENT -- MORE VICTIMS OR

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:16.487
REGENERATE OTHER BENEFITS DâN

02:23:16.554 --> 02:23:19.023
CHOOSING TO INVESTORS RECESS

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:22.026
RESOURCES ELSEWHERE [inaudible]

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.995
OKAY.

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:27.398
SO MY QUESTIONS.

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:28.499
RIGHT NOW.

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:31.636

02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:06.104
BEHIND THEM WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE

02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:07.805
A WAIT LIST OF APPROXIMATELY A

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:09.407
HUNDRED WOMEN WAITING TO GET

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:11.075
INTO THOSE PROGRAMS THEY'RE ALL

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:13.411

THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THE

02:24:16.214 --> 02:24:17.548
OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT WHICH

FACILITY THEY'D LIKE TO GO -- TO

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:20.718

FILLING THOSE BETS BEHIND THEM.

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.706
ARE THESE -- TRANSITIONAL

02:24:41.773 --> 02:24:43.107
FACILITIES.

02:24:43.174 --> 02:24:44.542
IT UP IN A WAY THAT.

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:49.614
THE STATE COULD POTENTIALLY.

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.315
CHARGE MEDI CAL [inaudible]

02:24:51.382 --> 02:24:53.317
I'M.

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:56.654
IT RECOVER COSTS.

02:24:56.721 --> 02:24:58.556
FOR THESE FOLKS THAT WE MIGHT

02:24:58.623 --> 02:24:59.924
RECOVER IF THEY WERE IN.

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:02.427
YOU KNOW THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER.

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:04.462
IF WE HOLD THEM IN OUR STATE

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:05.930
FACILITY OUR STATE PRISON

02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:07.765
FACILITY SO WE ACTUALLY HOPE TO

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.067
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND

02:25:09.133 --> 02:25:10.468
WHEN THOSE -- PROGRAMS WERE

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:12.637
INITIALLY BROUGHT ONLINE IN TWO

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:13.204
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND AS

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:15.306
WE'VE EXPANDED -- WE BELIEVE

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.874
THAT THEY DID MEET THE CRITERIA

02:25:16.941 --> 02:25:18.609
HOWEVER WE HAD SOME EXTENSIVE

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:20.344
MEETINGS OVER ABOUT EIGHTEEN

02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:21.846
MONTHS TO TWO YEARS WITH

02:25:21.913 --> 02:25:22.380
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

02:25:22.447 --> 02:25:23.047
SERVICES.

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.482
AT WHICH TIME THEY ULTIMATELY

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:26.117
DECIDED THAT ARE WOMEN DID NOT

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:27.852
MEET THE CRITERIA FOR MEDI CAL

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:29.587
ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:30.855
TECHNICALLY STILL INMATES.

02:25:30.922 --> 02:25:32.824
NOT RELEASED ON PAROLE AND THAT

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:34.392
THEY COULD BE RETURNED INTO THE

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:35.927
STATE PRISONS AT ANY TIME -- AS

02:25:35.993 --> 02:25:38.329
THE POLICY WORKS SO LIKE I SAID

02:25:38.396 --> 02:25:39.597
WE SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:41.065
TRYING TO GET THOSE WOMEN

02:25:41.132 --> 02:25:43.434
APPROVED FOR MEDI CAL ULTIMATELY.

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:44.836
THAT THAT WAS DISAPPROVED SO

02:25:44.902 --> 02:25:46.471
CURRENTLY WE WORK WITH OUR

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.505
HEALTH CARE SERVICES VERY

02:25:47.572 --> 02:25:49.574
CLOSELY THEY'VE WE'VE WORKED

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:51.843
WITH -- CLINICS IN THE AREA AND

02:25:51.909 --> 02:25:53.010
WE WORK THROUGH HEALTH NET TO

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:56.781
GET THEM SERVICES SO THERE'S NO

02:25:56.848 --> 02:25:57.448
IMPACT ACCESS TO CARE

02:25:57.515 --> 02:25:57.748
[inaudible]

02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:00.918
IT'S SO WHEN WE FIRST APPROVED

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:03.287
THIS IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:06.090
COST MIGHT BE LESS. TO THE STATE

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:08.626
FOR THEIR FOR HOLDING THEM.

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:10.728
OR FOR THEIR BEING IN THESE

02:26:10.795 --> 02:26:12.597
TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES VERSUS

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:13.931
BEING HELD.

02:26:13.998 --> 02:26:16.868
IN OUR CORRECTIONS FACILITY

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:17.668
THAT'S CORRECT THAT WAS THE

02:26:17.735 --> 02:26:18.703
ASSUMPTION AT THE TOP RIGHT NOW

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:22.440
THE COST PER INMATE IS HIGHER.

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:24.142
SO THE MEDICAL EXPENSES --

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:26.177
OBVIOUSLY ARE BILLED SEPARATELY

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:28.646
AND SO THOSE GO THROUGH THE

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:29.914
HEALTH NET CONTRACT.

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.682
SO ABSOLUTELY THEY'RE NOT BEING

02:26:31.749 --> 02:26:32.650
COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ALL THOSE

02:26:32.717 --> 02:26:34.352
ARE EXPENSES THAT THAT ARE BEING

02:26:34.418 --> 02:26:36.120
PAID FOR IT IS THE COST JUST TO

02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:37.355
HAVE THEM IN THE RE ENTRY

02:26:37.421 --> 02:26:39.991
FACILITY HIGHER PER PERSON.

02:26:40.057 --> 02:26:41.792
THAN IF THEY WERE IN THE ACT

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:42.927
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THEY HAD

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:45.329
BEEN IN PREVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:46.097
I DON'T THINK SO A LOT OF TIMES

02:26:46.164 --> 02:26:47.999
IS THIS POPULATION IS TENDS TO

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:49.333
BE HEALTHIER -- THAN THE

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.868
POPULATION WE HAVE IN OUR

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:52.770
PRISONS THAT'S ONE OF THE YOU

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:54.071
KNOW I'M NOT JUST DOING ITS

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:56.974
HEALTHCARE COSTS NO MY QUESTION

02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:58.309
A LITTLE OVERALL COSTS CORRECT.

02:26:58.376 --> 02:26:59.544
YET WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S

02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.845
MORE EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE THEM

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:02.680
THERE WE BELIEVE THAT -- IT'S

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:04.215
IT'S PROBABLY A COMPARABLE OR

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:05.850
EVEN A LITTLE BIT LESS AND THEN

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:07.585
ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO HAVE

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:10.188
A A FAIRLY LOW RECIDIVISM NUMBER.

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.722
THAT IS COMING OUT OF THAT

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:13.324
PROGRAM SO FAR AND SO WE

02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:16.294
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF OF THEIR

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.262
RELEASE AND NOT COMING BACK INTO

02:27:18.329 --> 02:27:20.598
PRISON IS A HUGE VALUE FOR US AS

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:21.799
WELL ALEJO'S COMMENTS SEEM TO

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:23.401
INDICATE THAT THE COST.

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:24.936
OUT THE REENTRY FACILITY IS

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:29.073
HIGHER PER PERSON THAN THE COST

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.908
AT THE THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:33.244
THE WOMAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN AT

02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:35.246
AND YOU INDICATE NO.

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.715
THEY'RE NODDING THEIR HEADS YES.

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:38.983
CAN WE HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION.

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:40.718
ADD THAT WE USE THE NUMBERS THAT

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:42.086
ARE PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSAL

02:27:42.153 --> 02:27:43.154
WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:27:43.221 --> 02:27:44.422
FINAL CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN

02:27:44.488 --> 02:27:45.990
NEGOTIATED SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

02:27:46.057 --> 02:27:48.492
THEY COULD CHANGE -- BUT IF YOU

02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:50.461
SIMPLY TAKE THE THE TOTAL DOLLAR

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.696
QUESTION DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER

02:27:51.762 --> 02:27:52.663
OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE HOUSE

02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:54.832
THERE YOU GET ABOUT.

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:55.666
SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR AND

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.001
OTHERWISE THESE WOMEN AS FAR AS

02:27:57.068 --> 02:27:58.469
WE UNDERSTAND WOULD BE HOUSED IN

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:00.638
THE STATE PRISON WHICH COSTS

02:28:00.705 --> 02:28:02.206
ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:03.307
PER INMATE.

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:05.409
JUST WHAT WE THIS IS THE COST TO

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:07.411
ADD OR REMOVE ONE IN MAINE IS

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:08.079
TWELVE THOUSAND BECAUSE YOU ONLY

02:28:08.145 --> 02:28:09.614
HAVE TO PAY OR WE ONLY HAVE TO

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.948
PAY FOR FOOD CLOTHES.

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:12.483
ETCETERA WE DON'T CUT CITY

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:14.285
STAFFING YOU ONLY SEE THOSE

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.119
SAVINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF

02:28:15.186 --> 02:28:16.153
STAFFING.

02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:17.288
YOU WOULD ONLY SEE THOSE IF WE

02:28:17.355 --> 02:28:18.189
WERE CLOSING A WHOLE PRESENT

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:19.257
THAT'S WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:20.491
THE EIGHTY THOUSAND NUMBER THAT

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:21.592
YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE FAMILIAR

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:23.461
WITH THAT'S THE AVERAGE COST OF

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:24.128
A INMATE.

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:25.896
PER YEAR IN THE STATE PRISON SO

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:28.399
BY MOVING THAT'S HUNDRED TWENTY

02:28:28.466 --> 02:28:29.900
WOMEN OUT OF THE STATE PRISON.

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:31.335
WE WOULDN'T BE CLOSING A STATE

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:32.770
FACILITY SO WE WOULDN'T SEE ANY

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:34.972
OVERHEAD COSTS GO WAY WHICH IS.

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:36.607
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:28:36.674 --> 02:28:38.976
STAFFING LARGELY -- SO WE WOULD

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:41.145
BE SAVING ON THINGS LIKE FOOD

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:44.715
AND CLOTHING AND OTHER WHAT WE

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:46.484
CALL MARGINAL COSTS.

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:47.184
NON OVERHEAD ESSENTIALLY AND

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:47.818
THAT'S ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND PER

02:28:47.885 --> 02:28:49.353
YEAR.

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:50.921
ALTHOUGH COUL BE LESS OF THESE

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:53.157
WOMEN PARTICULAR WOMEN ARE LESS

02:28:53.224 --> 02:29:00.197
COSTLY.

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.899
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY GERMANE

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:03.968
TO THIS DISCUSSION BUT IN EFFECT

02:29:04.035 --> 02:29:05.069
WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING IS THAT

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:07.805
ANY POPULATION REDUCTION IS NOT.

02:29:07.872 --> 02:29:09.774
A SAVING THIS MONEY.

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.242
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE COST IS

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:12.810
IN ANOTHER FACILITY SO ANY

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:14.545
POPULATION REDUCTION IN THE

02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:15.112
STATE PRISON IS NOT SAVE US

02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:16.947
MONEY.

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:18.749
THIS ISN'T A POP A REDUCTION OF

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:21.152
THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION IT

02:29:21.218 --> 02:29:22.386
SHOULD IT IS IN A FACILITY

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:24.422
CORRECT BUT SO IT'S REDUCING THE

02:29:24.488 --> 02:29:25.690
NUMBER OF INMATES IN STATE

02:29:25.756 --> 02:29:27.658
PRISONS AND EACH ONE OF THOSE

02:29:27.725 --> 02:29:29.727
COMES OUT AT AN ANNUAL COST OF

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:30.828
ABOUT.

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:31.462
TWELVE THOUSAND BUT THEN WE'RE

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:33.497
MOVING THEM INTO A MORE COSTLY

02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:35.533
FACILITY BY THE YES BY THAT SOME

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:40.705
SINS IN THE B. C. P. ABOUT --

02:29:40.771 --> 02:29:42.239
SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR SO IT'S

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:42.873
NOT.

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.375
IT'S SIXTY THOUSAND TOTAL PER

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.277
PERSON PER YEAR COMPARED TO IN

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:48.145
THE STATE FACILITY WHICH IS

02:29:48.212 --> 02:29:48.746
EIGHTY THOUSAND PER PERSON PER

02:29:48.813 --> 02:29:50.948
YEAR BUT IN A IN THE CASE OF

02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:52.783
ACTIVATING TUNE TO NEW

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:54.085
FACILITIES WITH.

02:29:54.151 --> 02:29:55.419
THE DECISION THERE IS.

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:56.821
IS TO ACTIVATE THE WHOLE

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:58.756
FACILITY AND WENT WITH A SMALL

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.291
FACILITY LIKE.

02:30:00.358 --> 02:30:02.793
SIXTY BEDS EACH YOU'RE STILL.

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:03.994
YOU'RE YOU'RE OPERATING THE

02:30:04.061 --> 02:30:05.162
WHOLE FACILITY ESSENTIALLY HOW

02:30:05.229 --> 02:30:06.297
MAY HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE YOU%

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:07.365
CHOOSE TO PUT THERE.

02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:08.499
SO.

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:10.434
IT'S ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE PAYING

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:13.137
THE AVERAGE CAUGHT THE FULL --

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:14.238
SIXTY THOUSAND TO ACTIVATE THE

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:16.073
NEW FACILITY WERE IS ON A ON

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:17.375
THE FLIP SIDE WHEN WE'RE

02:30:17.441 --> 02:30:18.976
BRINGING DOWN THE PRISON

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.311
POPULATION WE'RE NOT.

02:30:20.378 --> 02:30:22.113
AS AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPANSION

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:24.081
GOING TO CLOSE A PRISON SO WHEN

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:25.583
YOU'RE IN THE ACTIVE ON THE

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:27.651
ACTIVATION SIDE YOU'RE INCURRING.

02:30:27.718 --> 02:30:29.820
FIXED COSTS ON THE ON THE

02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:31.756
DECLINE TO THE PRISON POPULATION

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:33.057
YOU'RE NOT.

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:36.494
SAVING FIXED COSTS OVERHEAD

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:37.395
COSTS I SHOULD SAY THAT MAKE

02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:37.695
[inaudible]

02:30:37.762 --> 02:30:40.030
MAKES SENSE.

02:30:40.097 --> 02:30:40.398
SO IT.

02:30:40.464 --> 02:30:41.799
ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:43.200
THE EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

02:30:43.267 --> 02:30:44.735
EXAMPLE INCLUDES A LOT OF

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.036
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND THEIR

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:47.104
SALARY AND THE NUMBER OF

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:48.639
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THAT ARE

02:30:48.706 --> 02:30:50.074
EMPLOYED BY CDC OURS AND CAN BE

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:51.942
CHANGED BECAUSE WE TAKE THESE A

02:30:52.009 --> 02:30:53.210
HUNDRED TWENTY WOMEN OUT.

02:30:53.277 --> 02:30:54.245
AND SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONNA

02:30:54.311 --> 02:30:55.613
CHANGE NUMBER CORRECTIONAL

02:30:55.679 --> 02:30:56.814
OFFICERS UNLESS YOU'RE MAKING A

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:59.083
LARGE ADJUSTMENTS LIKE ENOUGH TO

02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:00.418
SHUT DOWN ENTIRE WING OF A

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:03.020
PRISONER OR PRISONER OVERALL.

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:05.423
BUT IT DOES DEAL WITH OUR OUR

02:31:05.489 --> 02:31:07.425
WOMEN'S FACILITY STILL ARE.

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:08.959
HI MORE OVERCROWDED DETERMINES

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:10.194
FACILITIES.

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:13.330
WHILE WE WHILE OUR COURT ORDER

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:16.767
NUMBERS IN IT IS A TOTAL NUMBER.

02:31:16.834 --> 02:31:18.169
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR INDIVIDUAL

02:31:18.235 --> 02:31:19.870
FACILITIES THE ONE SPECIFIC

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:22.373
CITIES ARE HAVE HAD LESS

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.875
REDUCTION IN OUR MORE CROWDED?

02:31:24.942 --> 02:31:28.112
THAN -- OUR MEN'S FACILITY SO.

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:29.947
WHILE IT MAY NOT REDUCE COSTS IT

02:31:30.014 --> 02:31:32.750
DOES ADDRESS THAT ISUE OF THE

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:35.519
OVERCROWDING WHICH WE ARE ALSO

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:37.354
SUBJECT.

02:31:37.421 --> 02:31:39.557
TO AHEAD I HAVE THE OVERCROWDING

02:31:39.623 --> 02:31:41.525
FIGURES IF YOU'D LIKE -- BUT BY

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:44.595
A FACILITY VERSES OVERALL OKAY.

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:47.531
SO THE OVERALL NUMBER IS A

02:31:47.598 --> 02:31:48.132
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT OF

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:48.466
WHAT WE HAVE.

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:51.969
CAVALIERS -- AS OF MAY EIGHTH

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:53.070
ONE OF OUR WOMEN'S FACILITIES

02:31:53.137 --> 02:31:54.705
WAS AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

02:31:54.772 --> 02:31:57.508
POINT 5% -- ONE WAS AT A HUNDRED

FAR MORE IN FAR LESS CROWDED.

02:32:27.204 --> 02:32:29.974
BERMAN FINANCE YOU WANTED TO ADD --

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:30.941
AYE MADELINE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF

02:32:31.008 --> 02:32:32.443
FINANCE I THINK.

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:33.878
WHILE IDEALLY IT WAS CORRECTED

02:32:33.944 --> 02:32:35.546
IF YOU TRULY THAT IF YOU PULL

02:32:35.613 --> 02:32:36.580
THE NUMBER SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

02:32:36.647 --> 02:32:38.215
C. C. TRP PROPOSAL AND DIVIDE IT

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:39.216
BY THE HUNDRED TWENTY

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:39.917
PARTICIPANTS YOU DO GET THAT

02:32:39.984 --> 02:32:41.485
COST OF SIXTY THOUSAND BUT IF

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:42.186
YOU AVERAGE.

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:44.255
THE COST OF THE ENTIRE C. C. T.

02:32:44.321 --> 02:32:46.891
R. P. PROGRAM IT'S ROUGHLY

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.225
EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS PER DAY --

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:51.128
PER -- OFFENDER WHICH IS ROUGHLY

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:53.030
THIRTY THOUSAND PER YEAR SO AS A

02:32:53.097 --> 02:32:55.366
AS A WHOLE FOR THE PROGRAM IT IS

02:32:55.432 --> 02:32:58.302
LESS BUT I DO UNDERSTAND BE

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:58.936
ALEJO'S POINT I JUST WANT TO

02:32:59.003 --> 02:33:00.104
POINT OUT THAT.

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:01.906
IN TOTAL THE THE OVERALL PROGRAM

02:33:01.972 --> 02:33:05.743
SAVINGS ARE LESS.

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:07.912
COSTS ARE LESS.

02:33:07.978 --> 02:33:10.648
VERY I WANNA RETURN -- TO TO THE

02:33:10.714 --> 02:33:12.883
MEDI CAL QUESTION -- SO YOU

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:14.852
INDICATED THAT.

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:16.186
WE THAT WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT IT

02:33:16.253 --> 02:33:17.821
ONLINE WE ARE HOPING THAT WE

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.790
WOULD BE ABLE -- TO RECOVER

02:33:19.857 --> 02:33:21.158
COSTS THROUGH MEDICARE ALL USED

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:22.893
UTILIZING THIS TYPE OF REENTRY

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.662
FACILITY BUT THEN YOU DESCRIBE

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:26.864
THAT IN INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:28.999
OWN DEPARTMENT.

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:29.633
THAT WAS DETERMINE WE COULD NOT

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.101
WERE THERE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:33.671
FEDS.

02:33:33.737 --> 02:33:34.939
SO THOSE DISCOVERY IN OTHER

02:33:35.005 --> 02:33:37.641
WORDS WE OURSELVES PREVENT OUR

02:33:37.708 --> 02:33:40.010
ABILITY -- TO POTENTIALLY RECOUP

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:42.079
THE COSTS.

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.215
YES FOR YES IT DOES SO THERE IS --

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.750
THERE'S A DOCUMENT THAT CAME

02:33:46.817 --> 02:33:48.385
FROM THE FEDS THAT TO FIND --

02:33:48.452 --> 02:33:50.654
WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.456
TO PROVIDE FOR MEDI CAL FNDING

02:33:52.523 --> 02:33:53.557
AND USING THAT DOCUMENT THAT

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:54.725
CAME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:55.759
IT WAS OUR?

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:57.528
AND OURSELVES OUR DEPARTMENT OF

02:33:57.595 --> 02:33:58.862
HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.664
ULTIMATELY USE THAT DEFINITION

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:02.266
INDETERMINATE THAT OUR

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:04.168
PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE.

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:06.036
YES MA'AM.

02:34:06.103 --> 02:34:07.738
I THINK WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT

02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:09.506
TO REVISIT THAT AND TO SEE WHAT

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.475
ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:12.576
TO MAKE.

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:14.712
IN THE FACILITY THEY MAY NOT BE

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:17.081
ACCEPTABLE BUT TO SEE WHAT

02:34:17.147 --> 02:34:17.948
ADJUSTMENTS WE WOULD HAVE TO

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:19.650
MAKE OR WHETHER THERE'S ANY

02:34:19.717 --> 02:34:20.751
WAIVERS.

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:23.654
BECAUSE THE PREMISE WHEN WE

02:34:23.721 --> 02:34:27.124
APPROVED THIS WAS THAT PREMISE

02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:28.292
AND HI.

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:33.330
I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE.

02:34:33.397 --> 02:34:34.665
MORE THOROUGHLY.

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:36.200
WE WOULD HAVE EXHAUSTED OUR

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:38.268
POSSIBILITIES VERSUS JUST

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:40.738
DETERMINING BASED ON F.

02:34:40.804 --> 02:34:45.643
DEFINITION ON A PIECE OF PAPER --

02:34:45.709 --> 02:34:46.777
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:50.214
COMMENTS I MEAN COLLEAGUES.

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.315
I JUST HAD SOMEONE ON THE

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:55.319
ELIGIBILITY -- SO WE HAVE WE

02:34:55.386 --> 02:34:59.323
HAVE LIKE -- THE COURTESY THE

02:34:59.390 --> 02:35:00.924
COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:03.160
PROGRAM THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING

02:35:03.227 --> 02:35:05.663
ABOUT NOW THEN WE HAVE -- THE

02:35:05.729 --> 02:35:08.265
FEMALE OFFENDER.

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:09.400
EMINEM PLYMOUTH PROGRAM.

02:35:09.466 --> 02:35:11.135
ACT THAT'S NOTELIGIBLE FOR

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.436
MEDICAL EITHER RIGHT.

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:13.437
SO THE THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM

02:35:13.504 --> 02:35:15.472
IS ACTUALLY A PAROLES BASED

02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:17.775
PROGRAM THE ONE IT'S BASED IT'S

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:20.077
IT'S UP PAROLE PROGRAMS OF THOSE

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:21.512
WOMEN ARE RELEASED FROM.

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:23.213
STATE PRISON AND SO IT'S MY

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.049
UNDERSTANDING THEY ARE ACTUALLY

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:26.116
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL DOT POINTS

02:35:26.183 --> 02:35:28.318
THEN THERE IS A MALE COMMUNITY

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:30.521
REENTRY PROGRAM.

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:31.822
THE ELIGIBLE.

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:33.624
IT'S IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS C.

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:36.393
C. T. R. P. SO TO SAY IT'S A NOT

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:41.999
ELIGIBLE -- THEN -- ENHANCE

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:43.934
ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM.

02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:45.569
SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR SIXTY TRP

02:35:45.636 --> 02:35:47.438
PROGRAM SIR THAT'S THE SAME

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:49.840
THING AS A CC OR DARK CUSTODY TO

02:35:49.907 --> 02:35:51.942
COMMUNITY TRANCE SO -- SO WHERE

02:35:52.009 --> 02:35:55.846
THESE PROGRAMS -- HOW LONG HAVE

02:35:55.913 --> 02:35:58.215
THEY BEEN ESTABLISHED -- IN --

02:35:58.282 --> 02:35:59.616
IN THE STATE BUDGET.

02:35:59.683 --> 02:36:00.184
SO THE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:01.685
TRANSIT TRANSITIONAL REENTRY

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:03.287
PROGRAMS BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.988
AND FIFTEEN THE MALE COMMUNITY

02:36:05.055 --> 02:36:07.925
REENTRY PROGRAMS CAME ONLINE

02:36:07.991 --> 02:36:10.694
YEARS EARLIER MAYBE.

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:11.895
WRITTEN RIGHT APARTMENT A

02:36:11.962 --> 02:36:13.197
FINANCE THAT CUT TO THE CITY

02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:14.098
TEAR PEAS THE WOMEN'S PROGRAMS

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:17.468
WITH TWENTY THIRTEEN AND M. C.

02:36:17.534 --> 02:36:19.770
R. P. WAS.

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:22.172
TWENTY FIFTEEN OKAY -- WAS --

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:23.507
WHAT WAS A PROGRAM OF THE CENTER

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:26.410
LOSE STARTED? FOR WOMEN'S

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:27.444
REENTRY PROGRAM SHE'S CHAIR

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:29.046
PROGRAM.

02:36:29.113 --> 02:36:31.181
WAS A PROGRAM.

02:36:31.248 --> 02:36:33.417
THAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY

02:36:33.484 --> 02:36:36.086
PROGRAM THIS CALL THEIR FOR I'M

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:36.854
JUST GETTING ALL THE NAMES AND I

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.922
WON OKAY TELL ME ABOUT WHEN WAS

02:36:38.989 --> 02:36:41.959
THAT ESTABLISHED.

02:36:42.025 --> 02:36:42.960
IS HOME.

02:36:43.026 --> 02:36:44.461
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WHAT'S THE

02:36:44.528 --> 02:36:45.129
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THIS

02:36:45.195 --> 02:36:46.663
AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THAT PROGRAM

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.232
SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS TRYING TO

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:49.466
FIGURE OUT ALL THESE PROGRAS.

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:50.801
THAT'S ONE I BELIEVE THAT WAS

02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:52.803
ESTABLISHED AROUND I'D WANT TO

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:56.140
SAY AROUND TWENTY ELEVEN AND

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:57.641
TWENTY TEN JONES SOMETIME IN

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:58.175
THAT -- IS AN AUTHOR THAT

02:36:58.242 --> 02:37:00.410
PROPOSAL AND BY THE DEPARTMENT

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:01.545
MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:03.313
MORE -- THAN THAN I IN GREATER

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:04.748
DETAIL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:37:04.815 --> 02:37:06.250
THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM

02:37:06.316 --> 02:37:07.718
TYPICALLY WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING

02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:09.586
WITH THESE WOMEN -- AND NOW IT'S

02:37:09.653 --> 02:37:11.889
AVAILABLE TO MEN AS WELL IF I'M

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:14.324
CORRECT -- THEY ARE ABLE TO STAY

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:15.993
IN THE COMMUNITY TYPICALLY IT'S

02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:17.394
WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY'LL

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:18.295
STAY.

02:37:18.362 --> 02:37:19.830
AS OPPOSED TO BEING IN A

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:21.265
FACILITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE C.

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:23.233
TRP SO THAT IS THAT'S THE MAIN

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.635
DIFFERENCE DOES THAT PROGRAM

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:30.774
ELIGIBLE -- FOR MEDI CAL.

02:37:30.841 --> 02:37:31.942
REIMBURSE YES YES THOSE MEN AND

02:37:32.009 --> 02:37:33.310
WOMEN IN THE ALTERNATIVE CUTS

02:37:33.377 --> 02:37:33.844
THE PROGRAM ARE ELIGIBLE.

02:37:33.911 --> 02:37:36.647
SO SO IF WE HAVE THAT PROGRAM IS

02:37:36.713 --> 02:37:37.214
ELIGIBLE IN THIS ONE ISN'T.

02:37:37.281 --> 02:37:38.215
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THE

02:37:38.282 --> 02:37:39.783
ONES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:41.552
CURRENTLY IN THE ONE THAT.

02:37:41.618 --> 02:37:43.086
OF HIS OLD ONE FOR THE MEDICAL

02:37:43.153 --> 02:37:44.988
REIMBURSEMENT. SEVEN THAT ARE

02:37:45.055 --> 02:37:46.990
ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR THIS.

02:37:47.057 --> 02:37:47.658
ONE KIND OF WONDERING WHY YOU'RE

02:37:47.724 --> 02:37:48.859
NOT ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR

02:37:48.926 --> 02:37:49.827
THE OTHER.

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:50.661
ONE SO THE ALTERNATIVE CUTS THE

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:52.329
PROGRAM THOSE THOSE OFFENDERS

02:37:52.396 --> 02:37:53.831
ARE ACTUALLY RELEASED OUT INTO

02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:55.933
EITHER A PRIVATE RESIDENCE OR

02:37:55.999 --> 02:37:58.502
INTO A PROGRAM -- AND AND SO WE

02:37:58.569 --> 02:38:01.338
NO LONGER HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT --

02:38:01.405 --> 02:38:04.107
ASIDE FROM PAROLES AND ARE

02:38:04.174 --> 02:38:06.877
TYPICAL -- INTERACTIONS WITH

02:38:06.944 --> 02:38:08.478
THEM ON A PAROLE BASIS AND

02:38:08.545 --> 02:38:10.280
THAT'S WHY THESE CUSTODY TO

02:38:10.347 --> 02:38:11.348
COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL RIO

02:38:11.415 --> 02:38:14.484
BRANCHER PROGRAMS THESE ARE OUR

02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:16.386
RUN.

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:17.955
WITH BY US WE MONITOR THEM WE

02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:18.922
HAVE PAROLE AGENTS AT THE

02:38:18.989 --> 02:38:20.357
FACILITY AS WELL AS COUNSELORS

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:22.960
AT THE FACILITY AND THEN WE HAVE --

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:24.828
TYPICALLY AT A NONPROFIT

02:38:24.895 --> 02:38:25.896
ORGANIZATION THAT RUNS THE RE

02:38:25.963 --> 02:38:27.397
AND HAVE BILL TATIAN PROGRAMS

02:38:27.464 --> 02:38:28.699
AND SUCH I UNDERSTAND HOW MANY

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.267
HOW MANY -- PEOPLE ARE IN THE

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:31.602
OTHER PROGRAM ON THE OTHER

02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:33.904
PROGRAM WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:34.872
FORTY WOMEN IN THE ALTERNATIVE

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:36.707
CUSTODY PROGRAM AND THEN FOR THE

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:37.341
MEN.

02:38:37.407 --> 02:38:39.843
WE WE ARE NORMALLY BETWEEN ABOUT

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:41.345
A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND

02:38:41.411 --> 02:38:43.080
TWENTY IS THAT ONE FULL.

02:38:43.146 --> 02:38:44.348
CAPACITIES AT THE THERE'S NO BAD

02:38:44.414 --> 02:38:45.716
NUMBERS THERE SO THAT REALLY IS

02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:47.384
AS MANY AS QUALIFY WE COULD PUT

02:38:47.451 --> 02:38:48.619
OUT THERE INTO THOSE PROGRAMS

02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:50.320
BECAUSE THEY GO OUT EITHER TO A

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:52.522
FAMILY MEMBER OR A SPOUSE PARENT.

02:38:52.589 --> 02:38:54.424
OR INTO A PRIVATE PROGRAM THAT

02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:56.994
THEY ACTUALLY -- FINE IS THAT

02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:58.528
THE PROGRAM WHERE THESE THEY GET

02:38:58.595 --> 02:39:01.531
SENT TO A A RE ENTRY NONPROFIT

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:03.634
ORGANIZATION.

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:04.201
AND THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEIR

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:04.868
CHILDREN.

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:06.503
SO THAT'S A ACTUALLY A SEPARATE

02:39:06.570 --> 02:39:08.171
PROGRAM THOSE A I'M TRYING TO

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:08.906
GET ALL THESE THINGS STRAIGHT

02:39:08.972 --> 02:39:10.807
SETS  COMMUNITY PRISONER MOTHER

02:39:10.874 --> 02:39:12.476
PROGRAM THAT'S A TWENTY FOUR BED

02:39:12.542 --> 02:39:13.977
WAS ONES WHAT'S IT CALLED THE

02:39:14.044 --> 02:39:14.945
COMMUNITY PRISONER MOTHER

02:39:15.012 --> 02:39:16.046
PROGRAM IT'S IN POMONA

02:39:16.113 --> 02:39:17.981
CALIFORNIA. TO TWENTY FOUR BED

02:39:18.048 --> 02:39:24.755
FACILITY RIGHT SO IS THERE

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:27.791
PROGRAM -- LOS WERE -- EXPANSION

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:30.627
IS THAT -- THOSE PROGRAMS

02:39:30.694 --> 02:39:31.762
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL.

02:39:31.828 --> 02:39:32.262
THE OF THE WOMEN IN THAT

02:39:32.329 --> 02:39:32.896
PARTICULAR PROGRAM ACTUALLY GO

02:39:32.963 --> 02:39:33.463
BACK TO THE INSTITUTION FOR

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:34.731
MEDICAL SERVICES THE CHILDREN

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:35.832
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL IN

02:39:35.899 --> 02:39:37.534
THEIR TREATMENT IS PROVIDED THAT

02:39:37.601 --> 02:39:39.703
WAY -- AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY

02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:41.505
AT TWENTY TWO WOMEN IN THAT

02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:43.473
PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- THE

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.042
NUMBERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:46.643
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT ARE FAIRLY LOW --

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:49.613
BASED ON ON THE FACT THAT THEY

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.281
CAN'T HAVE ANY CRIMES AGAINST

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:54.117
CHILDREN AND I KNOW ENDANGERMENT

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:56.620
TYPE OF OF ISSUES AND SO.

02:39:56.687 --> 02:39:57.721
WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A VERY

02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:59.356
LARGE PIPELINE FOR THAT

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:00.724
PARTICULAR FACILITY.

02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:01.858
RISEN ASKING THIS IS YOU'RE

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:03.226
YOU'RE ASKING.

FOR THE EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION --

02:40:05.862 --> 02:40:06.396
IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR THIS

02:40:06.463 --> 02:40:07.497
PROGRAM.

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:08.799
WHICH WE CAN GET REIMBURSED FOR

02:40:08.865 --> 02:40:10.367
MEDI CAL BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE

02:40:10.434 --> 02:40:11.635
OTHER PROGRAMS.

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:12.703
AND I KNOW THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

02:40:12.769 --> 02:40:14.538
QUALIFICATIONS DIFFERENT TYPES

02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:16.640
OF PEOPLE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW

02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:18.442
LIKE THAT BUT I I I I I I THINK

02:40:18.508 --> 02:40:19.843
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT.

02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:22.980
WE GET THE FULL SCOPE OF ALL THE

02:40:23.046 --> 02:40:24.648
THE RE ENTRY PROGRAMS.

02:40:24.715 --> 02:40:25.582
SAID AND AND WHAT'S WHAT'S

02:40:25.649 --> 02:40:28.218
WHAT'S THEIR ACTUAL SUCCESS AND

02:40:28.285 --> 02:40:29.920
FOR THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THEY'RE

02:40:29.987 --> 02:40:31.655
SERVING AND DO THEY DO THEY

02:40:31.722 --> 02:40:33.757
MERIT -- SOME CONSIDERATION

02:40:33.824 --> 02:40:35.726
EDITION OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AS

02:40:35.792 --> 02:40:37.828
OPPOSED TO THIS PROGRAM AND SURE

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:40.430
OF A THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:43.834
LOOKED AT THIS SO I THINK IT'S A

02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:44.334
FAIR QUESTION.

02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.203
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE --

02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:47.471
THESE -- SUCCESSFUL REENTRY

02:40:47.537 --> 02:40:49.439
PROGRAMS.

02:40:49.506 --> 02:40:50.907
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE SO

02:40:50.974 --> 02:40:53.076
SO I LIKE TO HAVE THAT.

02:40:53.143 --> 02:40:55.178
IN A WAY MAYBE WE HAVE SO MANY

02:40:55.245 --> 02:40:57.447
AT ARE THEY MANAGED BY THE SAME

02:40:57.514 --> 02:40:59.916
PEOPLE OR HE EXPLAINED OUT HOW

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.318
THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL THESE

02:41:01.385 --> 02:41:02.552
REENTRY PROGRAMS.

02:41:02.619 --> 02:41:04.187
SO IT THAT CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY

02:41:04.254 --> 02:41:05.689
TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS

02:41:05.756 --> 02:41:07.591
ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THAT FEMALE

02:41:07.657 --> 02:41:09.426
OFFENDER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

02:41:09.493 --> 02:41:11.395
EACH OF THE PROGRAMS ON THE

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:13.563
COMMUNITY ARE RAN BY A DIFFERENT

02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:15.899
ENTITY SO WE HAVE ON LA KATA

02:41:15.966 --> 02:41:18.001
ALLEN THE LOS ANGELES AREA WE

02:41:18.068 --> 02:41:19.136
HAVE WEST CARE.

02:41:19.202 --> 02:41:20.370
SO I ST JOHN'S HERE IN

02:41:20.437 --> 02:41:21.371
SACRAMENTO'S WITH DIFFERENT

02:41:21.438 --> 02:41:22.973
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP TO RUN

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.408
THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEIR

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:26.943
OVERSEEN BY OUR CONTRACT BED

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:28.979
UNIT WHICH FALLS INTO MY MY

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:29.980
MISSION.

02:41:30.047 --> 02:41:31.314
THE MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:33.050
PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY RUN BY THE

02:41:33.116 --> 02:41:34.551
DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:36.586

02:41:48.999 --> 02:41:50.500
THE THE WINNERS IN TERMS OF SIX

02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:51.802
SIN.

02:41:51.868 --> 02:41:52.636
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT

02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:56.139
WAY THANK.

02:41:56.206 --> 02:41:56.840
FEDERAL.

02:41:56.907 --> 02:41:58.875
MADAM CHAIR JUST A COUPLE BASIC

02:41:58.942 --> 02:42:00.143
QUESTIONS.

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:01.945
IT IS A HISTORY OF PROVIDING

02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:04.881
POPULATION ADJUSTMENTS IS THIS.

02:42:04.948 --> 02:42:06.349
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING.

02:42:06.416 --> 02:42:09.286
FOR NUMBER OF YEARS YEAH I'M

02:42:09.352 --> 02:42:11.088
LIKE A OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.355
ARE DRIVEN STE MORE ON CASELOAD

02:42:12.422 --> 02:42:13.690
OF LIKE OF THERE'S A LOT OF

02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:14.991
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:16.259
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A

02:42:16.326 --> 02:42:18.061
POPULATION ADJUSTMENTS LIQUOR

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:20.997
TWICE A YEAR -- WE HAVE A JUST

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:22.566
CONSIDER MADE.

02:42:22.632 --> 02:42:24.101
BASED ON OUR INMATE AND KAROLI

02:42:24.167 --> 02:42:25.902
LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE STAFFING

02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:27.704
STANDARDS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:28.839
WITH THAT POPULATION.

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:30.540
VOTER MANPOWER MANAGEMENT

02:42:30.607 --> 02:42:31.875
FUNCTIONS.

02:42:31.942 --> 02:42:32.542
IT'S THAT AND IT'S OTHER THINGS

02:42:32.609 --> 02:42:33.543
AS WELL IF THROUGH OUR

02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:36.179
POPULATION PROCESS WE ALSO DO --

02:42:36.246 --> 02:42:38.215
HOUSING UNIT CONVERSIONS AS WE

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:39.850
HAVE THE POPULATION CHANGES AND

02:42:39.916 --> 02:42:40.917
SHIFTS.

02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:44.654
AND WE NEED TO SHIFT THINGS

02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:46.690
AROUND WITH OUR PRISON.

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:48.358
AND WE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:48.992
NUMBERS OTHER WAY NO NUMEROUS

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:50.160
OTHER THINGS WE D THROUGH THAT

02:42:50.227 --> 02:42:52.028
PROCESS BASED ON POPULATION.

02:42:52.095 --> 02:42:53.230
AND I'M SEEING LEASE FOR THE

02:42:53.296 --> 02:42:55.265
ADULT POPULATION THAT THERE'S

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:56.466
SOME DECREASES.

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:58.068
BUT BIG NUMBERS BUT THREE FORTY

02:42:58.135 --> 02:43:00.971
ONE AND TWO SIXTY SIX DO YOU DO

02:43:01.037 --> 02:43:05.008
PLAYOFFS OR YES IN FACT WILL NOT

02:43:05.075 --> 02:43:06.376
LAY OFFS WE TRY NOT.

02:43:06.443 --> 02:43:08.311
TO BUT IN THIS -- PARTICULAR

02:43:08.378 --> 02:43:09.412
BUDGET WE HAVE.

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:12.082
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT ALL OF OUR

02:43:12.149 --> 02:43:13.250
INMATES THAT ARE EVEN OUT OF

02:43:13.316 --> 02:43:15.685
STATE FACILITIES WE CURRENTLY

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:17.254
USED TO HAVE -- INMATES IN -- A

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:19.422
FEW STATES WE NOW HAVE INMATES

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:21.258
ONLY LEFT IN ARIZONA.

02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:23.026
THAT GROUP WILL BE -- GONE Y

02:43:23.093 --> 02:43:24.628
THE END OF THE YEAR AND SO WE DO

02:43:24.694 --> 02:43:25.762
HAVE.

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:27.564
A FEW POSITIONS WITHIN THE

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:29.966
CONTRACT AND UNIT THAT ARE

02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:31.334
COMING DOWN WITH THAT AS WELL.

02:43:31.401 --> 02:43:33.570
SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASE YOU

02:43:33.637 --> 02:43:34.971
CAN GO OUT OF STATE.

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:38.241
AN OUT SOURCE.

02:43:38.308 --> 02:43:40.210
THAT IS CORRECT THAT OUR GOAL IS

02:43:40.277 --> 02:43:41.444
TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THOSE

02:43:41.511 --> 02:43:43.180
OUT OF STATE BEDS RIGHT BUT IT'S

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:44.915
A IT'S A STRATEGY WHEN YOU HAVE

02:43:44.981 --> 02:43:46.383
AN INCREASING POPULATION THEN

02:43:46.449 --> 02:43:48.685
AND SO TO A TEMPORARY SOLUTION

02:43:48.752 --> 02:43:50.353
THAT.

02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:51.788
BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'RE YOU'RE.

02:43:51.855 --> 02:43:53.356
TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING CLOSE

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:54.591
BY OKAY.

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:55.692
AND THEN SINCE YOU BEEN PUTTING

02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:57.527
A LOT OF NUMBERS.

02:43:57.594 --> 02:43:59.396
DO WE HAVE A COST PER CAPITA.

02:43:59.462 --> 02:44:04.501
FOR OUR PRISON POPULATION.

02:44:04.568 --> 02:44:05.969
MAY I RECOMMEND HER TO FINANCE --

02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:07.003
WE DO PUBLISH A PER CAPITA

02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:08.505
DISPLAY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:10.407
BUDGET EVERY YEAR WE CALCULATE --

02:44:10.473 --> 02:44:11.441
BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS HOW

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.210
MUCH IT PROXIMALLY COST TO HOUSE

02:44:13.276 --> 02:44:15.845
A PRISONER PER YEAR WE ALSO HAVE

02:44:15.912 --> 02:44:17.080
PER CAPITA FOR PAROLE -- CAN AND

02:44:17.147 --> 02:44:19.416
THAT'S DOES IT GIVE YOU PRIOR

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:20.717
YEARS AS WELL.

02:44:20.784 --> 02:44:22.252
GRADE WERE WHEN I GET THAT JUST

02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:23.453
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:24.821
SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE

02:44:24.888 --> 02:44:26.056
CAN CERTAINLY SENATOR STUFF

02:44:26.122 --> 02:44:29.025
INDEED WE DO A CORRELATION WITH

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:31.161
OTHER STATES TO BE COMPARED AND

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:32.662
WE HAVE IN THE COMPARISON I

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:33.196
CAN'T THINK OF WHERE IT'S

02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:34.564
PUBLISHED OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:37.667
BUT I CAN LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU.

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:38.935
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:39.169

02:44:39.236 --> 02:44:41.271
CERTAINLY.

02:44:41.338 --> 02:44:44.341
WHAT ABOUT TO THE -- COMMUNITY --

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:45.508
KASEY COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL

02:44:45.575 --> 02:44:48.044
REENTRY SO THESE ARE NOT LOCKED

02:44:48.111 --> 02:44:49.446
FACILITIES.

02:44:49.512 --> 02:44:51.181
OR AT THE LEAST THEY'RE NOT.

02:44:51.248 --> 02:44:53.683
LOCKED IN THE SAME WAY THAT AS

02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:55.919
THE FACILITY THAT THE INMATE

02:44:55.986 --> 02:44:58.088
LEFT BECAUSE IT STATES RATE IN

02:44:58.154 --> 02:44:59.456
THE ANALYSIS THAT THESE ARE

02:44:59.522 --> 02:45:00.523
PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE AN

02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:02.959
ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE.

02:45:03.026 --> 02:45:04.995
WHICH MEANS THE LEAVE.

02:45:05.061 --> 02:45:06.663
THEY ARE IN THERE'S MONITORING

02:45:06.730 --> 02:45:08.431
OF THAT DEVICE OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE

02:45:08.498 --> 02:45:10.267
SURE THAT THEY DON'T VIOLATE WE

02:45:10.333 --> 02:45:11.735
HAVE POOL WE HAVE PEOPLE ON

02:45:11.801 --> 02:45:14.571
PAROLE SELECT TRONIC MONITORING

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:17.073
DEVICES -- AND IT MENTIONS THAT

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:18.375
A PRO AGENTS AGENT IS

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:20.176
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTALLATION

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:21.945
AND MONITORING OF THE DEVICE.

02:45:22.012 --> 02:45:24.781
SO I GUESS I JUST REALLY FEEL

02:45:24.848 --> 02:45:26.483
THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGH

02:45:26.549 --> 02:45:28.218
ABOUT THE PREMISE OF STARTING

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:32.856
THIS PROGRAM WAS BECAUSE OF THE

02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:35.325
POTENTIAL WILL BOTH FIRST. TO

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:37.460
HELP INCREASE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY

02:45:37.527 --> 02:45:39.562
BUT ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE WE

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:42.098
WOULD BE ABLE.

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:44.934
TO UTILIZE THE THE BET FEDERAL

02:45:45.001 --> 02:45:46.636
BENEFITS AND OTHERS TO COVER

02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:48.305
COSTS THAT WE OTHERWISE SINKER

02:45:48.371 --> 02:45:50.440
IF WE HOLD THEM IN OUR STATE

02:45:50.507 --> 02:45:52.375
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:54.944
SO IT IT'S IT WOULD BE VERY

02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:56.179
SIGNIFICANT.

02:45:56.246 --> 02:45:58.581
WHAT WE WOULD SAY THAT THESE

02:45:58.648 --> 02:46:00.417
FOUR HUNDRED WOMEN WERE -- THAT

02:46:00.483 --> 02:46:01.685
ARE CURRENTLY WITHOUT EVEN AN

02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:03.286
INCREASE JUST THE FOUR HUNDRED

02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:05.555
BEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WERE

02:46:05.622 --> 02:46:09.359
AT IF IT IF THIS WERE DESIGNED

02:46:09.426 --> 02:46:11.127
IN THE WAY THAT WE HAD INTENDED

02:46:11.194 --> 02:46:14.931
WHEN WE APPROVED IN [inaudible]

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:18.168
TWENTY FIFTEEN A SORRY METAL

02:46:18.234 --> 02:46:19.269
INGREDIENTS DESK FINANCE -- SO

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:21.671
IT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:46:21.738 --> 02:46:22.772
IT'S CALLED THE THE MOVEMENT

02:46:22.839 --> 02:46:24.941
ISSUE AND THAT THE THE PEOPLE

02:46:25.008 --> 02:46:25.675
THAT THE WOMEN IN THESE

02:46:25.742 --> 02:46:26.943
FACILITIES AND MANY FACILITIES

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:28.345
ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME BACK TO

02:46:28.411 --> 02:46:30.513
THE FACILITY AT NIGHT AND STAY

02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:32.916
THERE THEY HAVE -- A DESIGNATED

02:46:32.982 --> 02:46:34.951
TIMES RIGHT THERE CHECK IN AND

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:36.986
SO IT'S THAT DESIGNATION ALSO

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:38.388
THAT THAT ARE DESIGNING SO I

02:46:38.455 --> 02:46:42.926
GUESS WHAT I'M RAISING IS.

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:47.831
THAT WE BOB THRICE THIS

02:46:47.897 --> 02:46:48.131
[inaudible]

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:51.901
UNDER THE PRETTY CATION THAT WE

02:46:51.968 --> 02:46:53.436
WOULD HAVE A DESIGN.

02:46:53.503 --> 02:46:56.239
THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO RECOVER

02:46:56.306 --> 02:46:57.874
THOSE COSTS SO I WANT.

02:46:57.941 --> 02:46:59.309
THE WHEN WHAT COMES BACK AND

THAT -- DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:15.291

02:47:15.358 --> 02:47:16.993
IT'S SORT OF ONE OF THOSE WELL

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.463

GO AHEAD YOU MAY PROCEED.

02:49:57.253 --> 02:49:58.821
OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN

02:49:58.888 --> 02:50:00.423
I'M LEO ROSE GOOD WHEN I AM THE

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.891
MANAGER OF THE OFFICE OF COURT

02:50:01.958 --> 02:50:03.893
RESEARCH AND THE OFFICE.

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.128
BY IS IN CHARGE OF THE

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:06.863
METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE SHOULD

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:08.097
SHIP NEEDS.

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:10.733
AND THE PRIORITIZATION METHOD A

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:12.735
BY WHICH WE WOULD -- INDICATE

02:50:12.802 --> 02:50:14.337
THE COURTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:16.573
FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS SO JUST VERY

02:50:16.639 --> 02:50:17.674
BRIEFLY AT THE USUAL NEEDS

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:19.509
ASSESSMENT IS A RUN A BI

02:50:19.576 --> 02:50:21.177
ANNUALLY AND THE EVEN NUMBERED

02:50:21.244 --> 02:50:22.211
YEARS.

02:50:22.278 --> 02:50:24.147
IT IS BASED ON THREE DIFFERENT

02:50:24.213 --> 02:50:26.416
FACTORS A THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF

02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:28.952
FILENE'S IN CASES OF VARIOUS

02:50:29.018 --> 02:50:29.886
TYPES.

02:50:29.953 --> 02:50:31.421
WORKLOAD STANDARDS THAT MEASURE

02:50:31.487 --> 02:50:33.156
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CASES OF

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:34.691
DIFFERENT TYPES TAKE FOR

02:50:34.757 --> 02:50:36.092
PROCESSING.

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:38.561
AND A PRIORITIZATION METHOD A TO

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:42.732
DETERMINE IN WHICH ORDER THE

02:50:42.799 --> 02:50:43.666
JUDGESHIP SHOULD BE ALLOCATED.

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:44.334
SO WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST

02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:45.668
OF UPDATING THE WORKLOAD

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:48.338
STANDARDS -- WE AND THAT IS WHY

02:50:48.404 --> 02:50:48.871
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE

02:50:48.938 --> 02:50:51.474
LANGUAGE A CONCERNING THIS ITEM.

02:50:51.541 --> 02:50:52.575
INDICATES THAT WE WOULD BE

02:50:52.642 --> 02:50:55.645
MAKING ALLOCATIONS IN SEPTEMBER

02:50:55.712 --> 02:50:58.448
ONCE -- AND AFTER -- AFTER THE

02:50:58.514 --> 02:51:01.451
WORKLOAD STANDARDS ARE UPDATED.

02:51:01.517 --> 02:51:03.786
SO IN TERMS OF THE USE OF A

02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:05.521
PRIORITIZATION METHOD THIS IS

02:51:05.588 --> 02:51:07.523
CODIFIED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:09.692
AND SIX NINE SIX ONE FOUR AND IT

02:51:09.759 --> 02:51:11.928
REFLECTS COUNCIL PRIORITIES OVER

02:51:11.995 --> 02:51:14.530
THE LAST DECADE -- WHICH INCLUDE

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:15.932
CONSIDERING COURTS WITH THE

02:51:15.999 --> 02:51:18.301
GREATEST NEED FOR JUDGESHIPS.

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:20.737
IMPROVING ACCESS TO COURTS A

02:51:20.803 --> 02:51:22.972
SAID THAT THE GREATEST NUMBERS

02:51:23.039 --> 02:51:24.641
OF USERS CAN BENEFIT.

02:51:24.707 --> 02:51:25.775
A KEEPING IN MIND THE

02:51:25.842 --> 02:51:28.277
AVAILABILITY OF COURT FACILITIES

02:51:28.344 --> 02:51:29.812
FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS.

02:51:29.879 --> 02:51:31.581
AND ENSURING THAT SMALL CORDS

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:34.083
ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE A TO QUALIFY

02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:35.918
FOR JUDGESHIPS.

02:51:35.985 --> 02:51:37.420
SO SPEAKING JUST VERY QUICKLY

02:51:37.487 --> 02:51:38.921
ABOUT THE PRIORITIZATION METHOD

02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:40.456
THAT WE USE THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:51:40.523 --> 02:51:41.958
WE FACE HERE IN THE BRANCHES

02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:42.925
PROBABLY.

02:51:42.992 --> 02:51:45.161
A SOMETHING THAT OTHER AGENCIES

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:47.563
HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT IT IS A A

02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:49.132
POINT TO FIND THE NEED FOR NEW

02:51:49.198 --> 02:51:50.133
JUDGESHIPS WHEN YOU HAVE COUNTY

02:51:50.199 --> 02:51:52.669
IS A VERY DIFFERENT SIZES.

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:55.638
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES --

02:51:55.705 --> 02:51:57.540
IT WITH THERE ARE OVER FIVE

02:51:57.607 --> 02:51:59.609
HUNDRED JUDGESHIPS I NEED FOR

02:51:59.676 --> 02:52:01.210
LET'S JUST SAY FORTY JUDGES IS

02:52:01.277 --> 02:52:03.413
ABOUT 10% OF THEIR OVERALL BENCH

02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:04.147
SIZE.

02:52:04.213 --> 02:52:06.215
WHERE'S IN A SMALL CORD LAKE

02:52:06.282 --> 02:52:07.717
LASSEN FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:09.052
TYPICALLY.

02:52:09.118 --> 02:52:10.687
APPEAR ON THE LIST FOR JUDGESHIP

02:52:10.753 --> 02:52:11.354
NEEDS.

02:52:11.421 --> 02:52:13.122
ARE THEY ONLY NEED ONE JUDGE BUT

02:52:13.189 --> 02:52:15.191
THAT REPRESENTS 30% OF THEIR

02:52:15.258 --> 02:52:15.925
BENCH.

02:52:15.992 --> 02:52:18.161
SO OUR METHODOLOGY ACCOUNTS FOR

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:20.763
THOSE BIG SIZE DIFFERENCES.

02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:22.565
AND IT BASICALLY USES AB METHOD

02:52:22.632 --> 02:52:23.900
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HOW

02:52:23.966 --> 02:52:28.705
CONGRESS A PORTION SEATS -- IT

02:52:28.771 --> 02:52:29.939
USES A SET OF RANKINGS SCORES TO

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:30.907
HELP.

02:52:30.973 --> 02:52:31.808
NORMALIZE THE NEED FOR

02:52:31.874 --> 02:52:33.476
JUDGESHIPS OF ALL CHORDS AND

02:52:33.543 --> 02:52:34.777
THEN IT GOES THROUGH THREE

02:52:34.844 --> 02:52:36.746
DIFFERENT ITERATIONS TO ACCOUNT

02:52:36.813 --> 02:52:38.915
FOR NUMERIC MEAN PERCENTAGE NEED.

02:52:38.981 --> 02:52:40.783
AND RELATIVE NEED.

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.351
I AND SO THAT IS ALL I HAVE ON

02:52:42.418 --> 02:52:45.121
THE TECHNICAL PORTIONS OF THE A

02:52:45.188 --> 02:52:46.589
NEEDS ASSESSMENT I'M HAPPY TO

02:52:46.656 --> 02:52:52.662
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:52:52.729 --> 02:52:54.297
BELIAU YOU READ SOME COMMENTS ON

02:52:54.363 --> 02:52:55.498
THIS GO AHEAD.

02:52:55.565 --> 02:52:56.599
I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE

02:52:56.666 --> 02:52:58.434
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE --

02:52:58.501 --> 02:52:59.936
SO WE WE DIDN'T HAVE CONCERNS OF

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.704
THE PROPOSAL BUT WE ONE OF THE

02:53:01.771 --> 02:53:02.638
THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO

02:53:02.705 --> 02:53:05.141
KNOW IS TO THE EXTENT THAT.

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:07.243
THE LEGISLATURE'S -- DESIRED

02:53:07.310 --> 02:53:10.346
GOAL IS TO EQUALIZE OR TO

02:53:10.413 --> 02:53:12.315
MAXIMIZE THE USE OF JUDICIAL

02:53:12.381 --> 02:53:13.950
RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE --

02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:16.152
YOU DO HAVE A TABLE ON PAGE

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:17.487
TWENTY ONE THAT SHOWS THE NEEDED

02:53:17.553 --> 02:53:19.188
THAT'S IDENTIFIED AND THAT'S

02:53:19.255 --> 02:53:20.957
JUST THE POSITIVE -- THE SAME

02:53:21.023 --> 02:53:22.558
STUDY ACTUALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE

02:53:22.625 --> 02:53:23.526
SHOWS THAT THEIR NUMBER OF

02:53:23.593 --> 02:53:24.861
COURTS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR

02:53:24.927 --> 02:53:26.362
AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL JUDGES

02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:27.864
BEYOND THEIR WORKLOAD.

02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:28.598
SO ONE THING THAT THE

02:53:28.664 --> 02:53:30.333
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS

02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:31.601
THAT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

02:53:31.667 --> 02:53:33.136
NEW POSITIONS THEY COULD

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:35.772
CONSIDER REALLOCATING JUDGESHIPS --

02:53:35.838 --> 02:53:37.573
FROM COURTS THAT HAVE MORE

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:39.142
JUDGES THAN THEIR SSE TO THOSE

02:53:39.208 --> 02:53:40.643
THAT HAVE LASSEN THAT WOULD KIND

02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:43.913
OF EQUALIZE FASTER THAT'S ONE

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:48.151
WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:48.885
OKAY.

02:53:48.951 --> 02:53:52.688
CENTER BILL WELD -- I THINK MY

02:53:52.755 --> 02:53:56.459
QUERY I A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST --

02:53:56.526 --> 02:53:58.094
WHAT IS WHAT IS HOW DOES THIS

02:53:58.161 --> 02:54:01.697
AFFECT US SPECIAL CHORDS?

02:54:01.764 --> 02:54:04.167
THAT ARE CREATED -- DO YOU

02:54:04.233 --> 02:54:06.736
ALLOCATE MONEY FOR SPECIAL

02:54:06.803 --> 02:54:08.471
COURTS SEPARATELY.

02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:10.072
YOU KNOW LIKE DRUG CORDS -- YOU

02:54:10.139 --> 02:54:12.074

02:54:12.141 --> 02:54:14.243
THE SPECIAL THE COURTS YOU KNOW

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:14.744

ETCETERA.

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:17.079
THEIR LITTLE MORE COSTLY YOU

02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:18.047
KNOW.

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:22.084
SO -- WHAT IS THE POLICY ON?

02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:23.119
HOW YOU SET UP THOSE KINDS OF

02:54:23.186 --> 02:54:24.854
PORTS?

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:28.591
ROAD TO TO THE WHEN YOU YOU SAID

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:32.829
EIGHT X. NUMBER OF JUDGES AND

02:54:32.895 --> 02:54:33.963
HELLO WHAT IS THAT MEAN

02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:35.598
REGARDING THOSE COURTS.

02:54:35.665 --> 02:54:37.166
IT CENTER BALLOT I THINK AT THE

02:54:37.233 --> 02:54:37.667
FIRST HEARING HAD THIS

02:54:37.733 --> 02:54:39.068
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:41.304
METHODOLOGY AND AT PRESENT THERE

02:54:41.370 --> 02:54:44.640
IS A SPECIFIC ALLOCATION -- IT

02:54:44.707 --> 02:54:47.076
IS -- BASED ON LOCAL PRIORITIES

02:54:47.143 --> 02:54:50.413
pNANCY EVER ARE CAN TALK ABOUT

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:51.180
WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR LOCAL.

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:52.348
IT IS AGAIN IT'S A MATTER OF A

02:54:52.415 --> 02:54:54.116
LOCAL NEED NOT EVERY COUNTY IN

02:54:54.183 --> 02:54:55.918
COURT NEEDS THE SAME AND

02:54:55.985 --> 02:54:56.819
COMMUNITY THE SAME TYPE OF

02:54:56.886 --> 02:55:01.357
SERVICE THEY'RE GIVEN MONEY FOR

02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:02.525
EACH [inaudible]

02:55:02.592 --> 02:55:03.893
JUDGE.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:04.994
BUT IF THEY WANT TO ESTABLISH

02:55:05.061 --> 02:55:06.395
SOME SEPARATE SPECIALLY TOWARDS.

02:55:06.462 --> 02:55:08.130
DO THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:55:08.197 --> 02:55:09.899
TO PAY FOR IT SOME OTHER WAY OR

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:10.900
OTHER THERE'S OFTENTIMES IT

02:55:10.967 --> 02:55:13.603
COSTS MORE RIGHT IT DOES AND IN

02:55:13.669 --> 02:55:15.838
IN THIS INSTANCE ARE THEY PAY

02:55:15.905 --> 02:55:16.505
FOR THE THERE ARE OTHER.

02:55:16.572 --> 02:55:17.640
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THEY

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:18.941
HAVE USED THEIR RESOURCES

02:55:19.008 --> 02:55:20.910
HISTORICAL RESOURCES AND PRIOR

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:22.979
INVESTMENTS LOCALLY TO SUPPORT

02:55:23.045 --> 02:55:25.081
THOSE ARE ARE SO -- STATE FUNDS

02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:26.449
FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE --

02:55:26.515 --> 02:55:28.618
INNOVATION GRANT FUNDS TWENTY

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:29.285
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TWELVE

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:30.920
MILLION OF WHICH WAS EARMARKED

02:55:30.987 --> 02:55:32.688
SPECIFICALLY -- FOR

02:55:32.755 --> 02:55:34.190
COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND THERE

02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:35.925
ARE TIMES SOME GRANTS EITHER

02:55:35.992 --> 02:55:38.060
LOCAL OR EVEN FROM SAY EXAMPLE

02:55:38.127 --> 02:55:38.661
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

02:55:38.728 --> 02:55:40.563
RELOCATION TO ASSIST IN --

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:42.064
ADDRESSING RECIDIVISM SO IT'S A

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:44.166
COMBINATION OF FUNDS -- THAT

02:55:44.233 --> 02:55:50.172
MAKE -- COURTS HAVE THAT THAT

02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:51.741
FUNDING AVAILABLE.

02:55:51.807 --> 02:55:53.409
AND IF IN IN NANCY LIKE TO DRESS

02:55:53.476 --> 02:55:54.510
HOW THEY DEAL WITH IT AND SAN

02:55:54.577 --> 02:55:55.578
BERNARDINO AND MADAM CHAIR

02:55:55.645 --> 02:55:56.345
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THE

02:55:56.412 --> 02:55:57.413
ALLOCATION COMES TO THE COURT

02:55:57.480 --> 02:55:58.481
AND IN ONE LUMP SUM AND THEN

02:55:58.547 --> 02:55:59.849
IT'S A A LOCAL COURT PRIORITIES

02:55:59.916 --> 02:56:00.816
THAT AND SAID HOW WE WANT TO SET

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:01.417
UP CALENDARS.

02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:03.753
SO THE THE PRICE IS THE SAME NO

02:56:03.819 --> 02:56:05.121
MATTER WHAT TYPE OF COURT ROOM

02:56:05.187 --> 02:56:07.323
YOU SET UP -- WE DO RECEIVE SOME

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:08.891
GRANTS LET'S SAVE A SUBSTANCE

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:10.860
ABUSE GRANTS WE CAN SOMETIMES

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:12.328
RECEIVE NATIONAL GRANTS FOR SOME

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:14.196
OF THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS MOST

02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:15.698
OF THOSE ARE PASS THROUGHS --

THROUGH FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES --

02:56:18.501 --> 02:56:20.369
SO THE COST OF A COURT ROOM IS

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:21.404
GOING TO BE THE SAME WHETHER

02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:25.541
