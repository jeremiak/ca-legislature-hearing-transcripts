00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:51.809
TEACH THE INTRO TO AMERICAN

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.144
POLITICS COURSE THAT ALL OF OUR

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:55.280
STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:56.881
LIKELY BECAUSE THE RED

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.182
LEGISLATURE REQUIRES IT

00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:58.483
[inaudible]

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:02.053
AND EVERY SEMESTER WHEN I TEACH

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.955
THAT I ASK THE STUDENTS HOW MANY

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:05.456
OF THEM GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD.

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:07.425
WHERE THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:09.394
TALKED ABOUT POLITICS OR POLICY

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.895
OR CITIZENSHIP OR ANY OF THOSE

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:11.896
THINGS?

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:12.964
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.332
DID NOT GROW UP IN SUCH A

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.433
HOUSEHOLD.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.235
AND SO THEY WERE NOT SOCIALIZED

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.103
INTO CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND SO

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.706
IT FALLS ON US AT THE COMMUNITY

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.174
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. TO

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.476
FILL THAT GAP IN AND ONE OF OUR

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:27.545

IS TO ENCOURAGE POSITIVE

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:33.685
LIFELONG HABITS AND THE HABIT OF

00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:34.519
VOTING IS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.119
THOSE.

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.721
ANOTHER PART OF THIS BILL I

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.356
THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IT

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.624
REQUIRES CAMPUSES TO SEND OUT

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.993
REMINDERS ON EMAIL AND SOCIAL

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.696
MEDIA. FOR REGISTRATION TO VOTE

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.631
AND AND REGISTRY AND AND VOTING

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.399
BATES AND SO FORTH AND I FIND

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:49.567
THAT TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO I

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:50.568
KNOW MY STUDENTS REALLY

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.470
APPRECIATE IT WHEN I ENCOURAGE

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:53.338
THEM.

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:55.540
REMIND THEM OF THE DATES OF IN

00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.575
TERMS OF FINALS AND SO FORTH AND

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.776
VOTING IS NO DIFFERENT.

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.278
THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN THOSE

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.713
ARE HAPPENING AND HOW TO

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.648
REGISTER AND WHEN TO REGISTER

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:05.149
AND SO ON IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.918
SO I ENCOURAGE VOTING FOR THIS

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:07.852
BILL SO THAT WE CAN KEEP

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:09.020

SEE LIKE OURS NOTHING IS MORE

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.247
FUNDAMENTAL THAN PROTECTING AND

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.416
PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:27.919

ACCESSIBLE.

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.757
AS A RESULT MORE MORE CALIFORNIA

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.892
VOTERS ARE CHOOSING TO EXERCISE

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:37.361
THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE BY MAIL THE

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:37.995
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MID TERM

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:40.031
ELECTIONS MORE THAN 65% OF

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:42.199
CALIFORNIANS USE VOTE BY MAIL

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.501
BALLOTS.

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:44.936
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STATE

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:47.638
LAWS REFLECT A GROWING REALITY.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.739
HOWEVER SALLY DURING THE SAME

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.608
MID TERMS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:54.111
THE THESE LAWS ARE ALSO FLAWED

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.146
AND WE MUST FIX THEM.

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.414
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.748
VOTERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.784
BALLOTS UP UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.286
THE ELECTION ON ELECTION DAY AND

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:03.888
SO I'M NEVER RECEIVED THEIR

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:04.555
BALLOT AT ALL.

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:07.725
I REQUIRING THEM TO REQUEST A

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.527
PROVISIONAL BALLOT.

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:10.962
SOME VOTERS AS I MENTIONED I

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:13.297
DIDN'T ARE NOT AWARE OF THE

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.333
PROVISIONAL BALLOT PROCESS IT'S

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.835
AN EDUCATION HI THAT WE STILL

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.203
HAVE TO GET OUT TO THE COMMUNITY.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.539
ESPECIALLY FIRST TIME VOTERS THE

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.140
CALIFORNIA VOTER PROTECTION ACT

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:25.376
WILL HELP FIX THIS IN TWO WAYS

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.178
FIRST IT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:29.246
REGISTRARS TO COMPLETE.

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.681
THE DISTRIBUTION MAIL BALLOTS TO

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:33.217
EARLY VOTE BY MAIL VOTERS ARE

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:36.120
WITHIN FIVE DAYS WHEN THEY START

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:36.887
THE MAIL.

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:38.689
BALLOT PROCESS WHEN THEY START

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.957
MAILING THEM OUT.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:42.093
I IN THE EXISTING LAW THIS IS

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.461
TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.729
ELECTION DAY.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:45.896
LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:48.699
NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING TIMELINE

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.267
FOR WHEN BALLOT MAIL BALLOTS ARE

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.335
SENT.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.870
BY INSURING THAT EARLY

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.905
REGISTRANTS ARE CENTER BALLOTS

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:56.641
WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE EXISTING

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.476
THRESHOLD WILL MAKE IT MORE

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:00.444
LIKELY THAT VOTERS WILL RECEIVE

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.279
THEIR BALLOTS ON TIME ALLOWING

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:03.881
THEM TO THE TO DO THE

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.016
APPROPRIATE RESEARCH.

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:08.753
ON CANDIDATES AND MEASURES.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:09.787
COUNTIES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.622
SEND VOTERS WHO CHOOSE TO

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.190
REGISTER EYES VB AND AFTER THE

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.326
EXISTING TWENTY NINE DAYS ON A

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:16.427
ROLLING BASIS.

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:18.429
SECOND THE BILL ALSO REQUIRE

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.331
THAT A VOTE CENTER.

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.799
I BUT I BOTH CENTER COUNTIES

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:23.601
THAT THERE'S A VOTE CENTER IN

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:28.005
EACH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT IS.

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:29.373
FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.408
FOR MORE.

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.109
AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:35.046
COUNTIES TO REQUEST A WAIVER. TO

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.247
THE SECRETARY STATE THAT IT ALSO

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.882
EXPLAINS WHY THEY CANNOT COMPLY

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.950
WITH THIS REQUIREMENT.

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.285
I JUST TO ALSO NOTES I

FAIR DEAL WHICH WAS -- THE

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.701
INSIDE TO HELP.

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:25.635
LOWER INCOME POSTS WERE FAMILIES

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.971
MOVE OUT OF THE SLUMS AND INTO

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.372
BETTER LIVING SITUATIONS

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:29.673
[inaudible]

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.875
SO.

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.209
THOUSANDS IN OUR STATE DID A

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.844
LONG LONG TIME AGO BUT THERE'S

00:53:34.911 --> 00:53:36.212
NO QUESTION THAT.

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.747
OUR STATE HAS CHANGED

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:39.416
CONSIDERABLY SINCE.

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:39.950
NINETEEN FIFTY OUR SOCIETY

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:41.751
CERTAINLY HAS VERY DIFFERENT

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.486
ATTITUDES NOW ABOUT RACE IN THIS

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.154
RACE AND ETHNICITY CLASS AND

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.589
POVERTY.

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.958
HI BUT NOTHING TO POINT OUT.

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.693
WAS AT THE TIME THEY WERE FAR

00:53:49.759 --> 00:53:50.160
FUEL TOOLS.

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.761
ARE FOR RESIDENTS TO ALTER OR

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:53.763
BLOCK PLANS FOR NEW HOUSING

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.798
THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:57.067
QUALITY ACT THERE WAS NO BROWN

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.635
ACT THERE'S NO COASTAL ACT.

00:53:58.702 --> 00:53:59.970
THERE WERE FAR FEWER LAWSUITS IN

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:00.804
GENERAL YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:04.207
CHARTS ON ON THAT.

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.843
SO I THOUGHT NOW ARTICLE THIRTY

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.144
FOUR REALLY DOES STAND AS AN

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:10.180
ANACHRONISTIC AND EXPENSIVE

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.781
CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER.

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:13.149
THAT SUBJECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:14.317
TO A WEB OF REGULATIONS AND

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.552
COSTLY ELECTIONS A LOT OF

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:17.187
UNCERTAINTY THAT END UP DRIVING

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:19.022
UP THE PRICE OF BUILDING

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:19.589

CALIFORIA'S VOTERS HAVE TIME

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.129
CLEAR THAT THEY WANT US AS THEIR

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:33.856
THAT THE BILL IS NARROWLY

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.824
TAILORED TO JUST ADDRESS THE

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.159
MANIPULATION OF THE ACTUAL

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:39.428
SPEECH OR CONDUCT OF A CANDIDATE.

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:42.364
NOT MINOR STATIC TOUCH UPS.

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:42.865
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:43.866
SIGNIFICANT FIRST AMENDMENT

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.200
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT IS

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:46.368
CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND I'M

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.569
COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.771
THESE ISSUES.

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.139
I WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT I

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:51.807
HAVEN'T SEEN A COURT DETERMINE

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.042
THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT GRANTS

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.977
SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO LITERALLY

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.145
PUT IN THEIR WORDS.

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:58.213
INTO MY MOUTH.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:58.814
WHICH IS WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.449
DOES.

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:01.784
IF PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.218
TODAY THE BILL WILL BE REFERRED

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:04.186
TO SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:06.088
NEXT WHERE I'M SURE THESE ISSUES

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.057
WILL GET A THOROUGH VETTING.

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.792
HOWEVER AS NOTED IN THE ACLU'S

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.493
OPPOSITION LETTER ELECTION

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.195
INTEGRITY IS A WEIGHTY

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.130
GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST THAT MAY

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:16.065
BE ACCOMPLISHED.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.299
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT IF

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.934
NARROWLY TAILORED.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:19.535
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:22.705
VOTE.

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:25.507
THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:25.808
[inaudible]

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:42.091
OF OPPOSITION

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:44.927
.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.462
BEFORE YOU TESTIFY I'M GONNA

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:47.463
HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A MOMENT S

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:50.699
SENATOR NIELSEN TO TAKE OVER THE

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.968
RESPONSIBILITY OF CHAIR -- AS

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:53.335
THE VICE CHAIR.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:56.371
OF A COUPLE THINGS ONE I WANT TO

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:58.874
MAKE MENTION -- ASSEMBLYMAN

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.110
BERMAN BERMAN THANK YOU VERY

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.411
MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME IN THE

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.645
COMMITTEE.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.448
WE DO HAVE SOME SOME WAY TO GO --

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:08.150
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.219
IN I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:13.155
SO -- WE'LL SEE THIS AGAIN

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.456
JUDICIARY.

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:15.991
AND THE I'LL BE BACK HERE IN.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:19.394
TWO MINUTES OR SO THANKS THANKS.

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:22.131
I THANK YOU.

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.632
THANK YOU MISTER.

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.300
VICE CHAIRMAN I'M WOULD BE PROUD

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.502
THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.936
ASSOCIATION.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:30.205
AND I REALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.673
WHAT THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY WELL

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.542
INTENTIONED WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.210
IT'S ULTIMATELY AN INEFFECTIVE

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:37.679
AND FRANKLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.681
SOLUTION THAT CAUSES MORE

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.150
PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.351
THIS BILL IS A CONTENT BASED

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.253
REGULATION OF SPEECH AND AS SUCH

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.088
IT MUST BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.422
SERVE A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:48.724
PURPOSE.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.958
AS THE AUTHOR NOTED I THINK WE

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:51.460
CAN ALL AGREE THAT MAINTAINING

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:52.895
THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS IS A

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.429
COMPELLING PURPOSE BUT THE

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:55.964
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THAT

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.466
IS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.734
AND IT FEELS THAT TESTED A

01:13:58.801 --> 01:13:59.802
NUMBER OF WAYS THAT ARE

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.903
DISCUSSED IN THE LETTER WE

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.070
SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.406
ARE ALSO NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.275
ALL FOCUS HERE JUST ON WHAT I

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:07.843
SEE IS THE MOST NOTABLE LACK OF

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.145
NARROW TAILORING IN THIS BILL.

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.013
AND KNOCKS ITS LACK OF

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.981
EFFECTIVENESS TO SOLVE THE

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.483
PROBLEM IT'S ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:15.984
THE BILL RELIES ON A PERSON THAT

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:17.653
SHARING AN AUDIO OR VISUAL WORK

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.921
TO DETERMINE IF THE WORK HAS

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.756
BEEN MANIPULATED YET BY ITS OWN

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.524
TERMS THE BILL ONLY APPLIES WERE

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.828
REASONABLE PERSON WOULD BELIEVE.

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:26.862
THE WORK TO BE AUTHENTIC.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.230
HAVING NO RELIABLE WAY TO

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.631
DETERMINE AUTHENTICITY THEIR TWO

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:32.167
LIKELY OUTCOMES FROM THIS BILL.

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:33.502
ONE IS I DON'T HAVE A PROFOUND

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.237
CHILLING EFFECT ON SPEECH

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.939
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE.

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:39.675
I DIS INCENTIVIZE TO SHARE

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.443
CONTENT THE PICTURES CANDIDATES

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.712
REAL OR FAKE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.180
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.748
INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS ACTING IN

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.850
GOOD FAITH THESE ARE NOT JUST

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.384
BAD ACTORS.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.719
THE SECOND IS THAT WE'LL SEE AN

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.454
OVER LABELING OF CONTENT

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.755
DEPICTING CANDIDATE SO THAT

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:54.890
PEOPLE CAN AVOID LIABILITY UNDER

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.425
THE BILL.

01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:57.926
THE RESULT IS THAT VOTERS WILL

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.561
BE LAST RATHER THAN MORE

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.929
INFORMED.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.932
AND EVEN IN CASES WHERE LABELING.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.767
AS MANIPULATED IS APPROPRIATE

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.469
UNDER THE BILL.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:08.570
THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTER

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.272
CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.840
THAT MEANS WHEN IT COULD BE

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:13.108
SOMETHING AS MINOR AS A TOUCH UP

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.676
THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:16.011
INTENDS TO CHANGE THAT.

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.579
BUT THIS COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.414
WHAT IS CONSIDERED MANIPULATION

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.649
AND IT DOESN'T INFORM THE VOTER

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:23.952
AS TO WHAT THE MANIPULATION IS.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.787
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT DEEP FIX

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:26.722
OUR AN OLD PROBLEM OF

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:29.024
DISINFORMATION DRESSED UP IN NEW

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.525
CLOTHES AND WE ALREADY HAVE

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:34.363
TOOLS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM.

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:36.064
SOLUTION IN TIME WE HAVE MORE

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:38.333
SPEECH AS THE AUTHOR NOTED.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.102
THERE WAS THE NANCY PELOSI VIDEO

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:41.536
THAT WENT AROUND AND WHAT WE SAW

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.838
IS THAT THAT WAS SHARED THERE

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.540
WAS A CONVERSATION AND IT WAS

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.141
CALLED OUT AS FATE [inaudible]

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.676
IF.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.011
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SOME BEANS

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:49.945
FAKE.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.380
THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EVEN

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.682
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION UNLESS

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.283
THE DETERMINATION HAS ALREADY

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.450
BEEN MADE.

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:56.852
AND SECOND WE HAVE EXISTING

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:59.354
DEFAMATION LAWS THAT PROTECT OR

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:02.391
THE PROVIDE A CAUSE OF ACTION.

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.826
FOR A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN WHO'S

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.228
HAD THE REPUTATION INJURED AS A

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.229
RESULT OF A FALSE STATEMENT

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.530
AROUND THEM.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:09.731
THERE'S A WELL DEVELOPED BODY OF

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:12.034
LAW THAT BRINGS THOSE A

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.702
DEFAMATION CAUSE OF ACTION.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.537
IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTION

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.806
AND I DON'T SEE HOW THAT THOSE

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.374
LAWS FALL DOWN IN THIS

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.810
CIRCUMSTANCE SO WITH THAT WE ARE

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.046
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE WE WOULD ASK

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.080
FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU.

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.648
GIVE PLEASE.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:27.282
THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND

BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.455
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS IN

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.022
YOUR DISTRICT.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:34.523
THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:36.158
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR AUDIENCE

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.693
IS BUILT ON TRUST.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:38.860
BUILT ON TRANSPARENCY TO

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.595
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.197
IN OMBATING THESE DEEP FAKE

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.967
VIDEOS UP WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:45.934
INITIAL EFFORT.

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.035
AS YOU KNOW THE WORLD OF

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.705
POLITICAL SPEECH IS COMPLEX IS

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:51.540
FRAUGHT WITH PITFALLS AND FOR

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.342
THOSE TO TRY TO IMPOSE

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.443
RESTRICTIONS.

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.144
BASS A REALLY HIGH HURDLE LOCKED.

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:58.113
THIS IS NOT JUST TECHNICALLY

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.048
IMPRACTICAL BUT IS LEGALLY

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:06.188
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUR DISTRICT BOB

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.723
BROADCASTERS TO COMPLY WITH.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:08.757
YOUR SENATE OPPONENT THE NEXT

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:09.891
ELECTION COULD PLACE A DEEP FAKE

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.226
AD ON THE RADIO AND TELEVISION

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.060
STATION IN YOUR DISTRICT.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.295
HE COULD TELL THE STATION THAT

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.097
IS A DEEP BIG VIDEO AND YOUR

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.732
LOCAL BROADCAST STATION COULD

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.867
STILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.068
EVEN IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.070
FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS RADIO AND

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:23.739
TELEVISION STATIONS FROM

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.874
CENSORING A FEDERAL STATE OR

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.776
LOCAL CANDIDATES POLITICAL ADS

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.511
IN ANY FASHION INCLUDING

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.013
DISCLOSURES.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.681
THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS ARE FOR

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:35.317
OBSCENE ADDS AN TO INSERT A

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.752
SPONSORSHIP ID.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.320
SO BY PLANT PASSING THIS BILL

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:39.855
YOU PUT YOUR BROADCASTERS IN

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.156
EXTREME JEOPARDY.

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.791
THEY CANNOT REFUSE A DEEP FAKE

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:47.095
AD NOR CAN THEY PUT ON THE

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.730
REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.065
THIS BILL ALSO MAKE IT MUCH MORE

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.533
EFFECTIVE IN DISRUPTING YOUR

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.301
LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:55.704

THE AIR BY THREATENING

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:03.645
LITIGATION.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.347
IMAGINE YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF

MANIPULATED.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.225

PUTTING YOUR STATIONS IN A

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.068
TERRIBLE POSITION.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.736
BROADCASTERS CANNOT PROTECT

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.704
THEMSELVES BY REFUSING TO AIR

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.339

ANY GIVEN STATE OR LOCAL RACE.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.680
ONCE THEY ACCEPT AN AD FROM ONE

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.482
CANDIDATE IN A STATE OR LOCAL

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.249

THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT ADVERTISING

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.521
CENSORSHIP.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.857
SO IF THERE IS NO 1100% ACCURATE

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:51.726
WAY TO DETECT DEEP.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:52.928
SIX AND BROADCASTERS ARE.

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.729
UNABLE LEGALLY TO REFUSE THE

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.399

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.900
YOUR STATIONS MAY BE FORCED TO

SPEECH IS AT THE CORE OF THE

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.395
FIRST AMENDMENT UNFORTUNATELY

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.164
WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THE

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.066

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.235

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:41.042
MISTRUST GO.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.077
MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS BERNIE

APOLOGIZE -- BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.751
RAISE SOME CONCERNS ARE VERY

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.253
SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER POWERS

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:56.525

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:57.959

ANYONE'S CON.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:02.397
AND THAT'S THE KEY THING HERE

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.666
FOR US -- WE ARE NOT THE POLICE

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.501
WE ARE NOT THE CENTER POLICE ON

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.270
THE INTERNET ON VIDEO.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.939
OR ON ANY OTHER MEDIA MECHANISM

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.841
SO RIGHT NOW THE BILL WOULD PUT

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.010
AN OBLIGATION ON US. TO MAKE

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.178

APOLOGIZE AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:24.953
TODAY BUT IT ALSO IS REALLY

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.588
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:27.989
I WILL BE BETTER POSITION FOR

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.157
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT SHOULD

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:32.327
THE BILL MOVE BUT WE ARE GREATLY

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:33.662
CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:34.529
SO MANY CHARGES PASSED LAST YEAR

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.932
pANYTHING SO.

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:40.368
THIS IS KIND OF CONTRARY TO THAT

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:41.403
POSITION.

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:42.003
THANK YOU HERE'S WE HAVE ONE

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.505

DON'T HAVE AN OF SPECIAL

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.049
POSITION IN OUR CONCERN IS VERY

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:56.017
NARROW TO THE CIVIL ACTION

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.152
PRIORITIES.

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:58.420
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.621
NEARING IT TO JUST THE

CANDIDATES BUT IN REGARDS TO THE

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.058
PRIORITY OVER OTHER CIVIL

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:05.460
MATTERS THERE'S MANY STATUTES

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.362
THAT STATE THAT THERE MAY NOT

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.930
MATTER TAKES PRIORITY. TO TO A

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.999
JUDGE WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.735
ACTUALLY TAKES PRIORITY SO EVEN --

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:16.137
REMOVING THAT PRIORITY LANGUAGE

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.639
BECAUSE THEY CAN ALWAYS COME

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.442
UNDER AN EX PARTE MOTION CHIARO --

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:22.711
OR ALLOWING THE JUDGE DISCRETION

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:25.146
AND WHEN THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.682
THESE CASES AT ALL HAVE PRIORITY

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:30.752
SO THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FOR TO

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:31.453

OPPOSITION.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:46.668
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.169
IMPORTANT BILL AND I THINK IT'S

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.371
AN ISSUE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:51.006

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:55.010
CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION.

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:57.912
IS THERE A WAY TO GET TO A

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:01.049
NEUTRAL OR A NON OPPOSE POSITION

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.417

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:11.493

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.802
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND AND

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.037
CURRENTLY NOT A PERFECT BILL --

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.405
ANDAND SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.140
GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH -- THE

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:26.574
DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE OPPOSE

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:27.776
I I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:29.144
THAT ARE EASIER TO WORK OUT THAN

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.645
OTHERS -- IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.314
OUR INTENT FOR BROADCASTERS TO

PLEASE CONTENT -- AND WE CAN AND

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:35.483
WILL AMEND THE BILL TO CLARIFY

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.918

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:43.858
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.827
I'M HAPPY TO COMMIT -- TO IN

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:48.763

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.265
JUDGES ASSOCIATION TO MAKE SURE.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.599
THAT WE CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE --

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.501
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:54.836
THAT'S EASY TO WORK OUT --

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.905
ISSUES AROUND IT CONCERNS ARE ON

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.840
THE FIRST AMENDMENT MIGHT BE --

01:22:58.907 --> 01:22:59.908
YEAH THERE THERE MIGHT JUST BE.

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.443

DIFFERENCES OF OPINION -- ON

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.179
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.647
GONNA DIVE INTO A LOT IF THE

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.382
BILL GETS OUT OF ELECTIONS AND

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.750

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.418
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I'M.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:11.386

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:24.999
SPEECH.

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:26.634
BECAUSE MY BILL DOES NOT

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.837
PROHIBIT ANYBODY FROM STATE

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.238

POLITICAL ISSUES MY BILL THE

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.610
SAYS THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE

MY MOUTH -- NOW I FULLY

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:39.481

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:40.882
THAN THAT -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.283

THIS REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:54.229
DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.731
TECHNOLOGY BEFORE THE ELECTION

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.233

THIS BECAUSE I DO I DO WORRY

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.681
LIKE I SAID BEFORE THAT THESE

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:14.716
DEFECTS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.084
WORSE AND PUT ALL OF US IN A BAD

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:16.818
SPOT.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.753
NOT JUST AS ELECTED BUT AS THE

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.722
PUBLIC AT LARGE SURE NOT I MEAN

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.689
I I'D START BY SAYING WE

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:24.793
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE THE

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:25.894
TROUBLING USES THAT THIS

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.329
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE PUT TO SO.

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.497
I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO SAY

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.932
THAT WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THE

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.967
CONCERN -- IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:35.036
WE GET THERE AND I THINK MY

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:36.237
COLLEAGUE WITH THE ACLU SENATE

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:37.572

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:40.108
I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:41.976
WE CAN GET THERE IN THIS CASE

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:42.577

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:43.945
TALK OKAY FAIR ENOUGH YEAH I

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.947

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.849
THAT YOU HAVE HERE.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.250
IS THE PROCESS ITSELF.

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:51.719
IF YOU CANNOT TELL.

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:53.822
SOMETHING IS A DEEP ACHE YEAH IF

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:56.524
THE EXPERTS HAVE DIFFICULTY.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.893
HOW CAN YOU PUNISH SOMEBODY

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.995

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:03.898
GOT SIXTY DAYS BEFORE ELECTION --

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.167
AND NOW LET'S SAY THAT THE

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.102
BURDEN DOES FALL ON THE PERSON

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.204
WHO CREATED VIDEO TO PUT THE

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.472
THING WILL.

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:12.140

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:20.048

POTENTIAL MANIPULATION DUE TO

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.658

THE DOOR FOR THE REGISTRATION OF
