A PLEASE. WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE EXPANDS ACCESS TO CARE BY ALLOWING MEDICARE CERTIFIED AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS BETTER KNOWN AS A SEIZE TO PERFORM SELECTIVE PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION PCI PROCEDURES. SUCH AS ANGIOPLASTY IS UNSTINTING AND CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURES. EXPANDING THE CERTIFIED SPECIAL CARDIAC PROCEDURES IN A FEES WILL REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS OVERALL WITHOUT COMPROMISING SAFETY. AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMING THESE PROCEDURES IN WELL OVER HALF THE COUNTRY FOR YEARS. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PCI PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN A SEIZE WITH A COMPLICATION RATE WELL UNDER OUTDATED STATUTE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY ELEVEN STATE THAT EXPLICITLY LIMIT THE SIZE OF SERVICE WHERE THESE CARDIOLOGY PURPLE SERVICES CAN BE PERFORMED. CALIFORNIA'S RESTRICTION ON THE SUCH PROCEDURES IS OUT OF STEP WITH OTHER STATES AND IS OUT DATED. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF PERFORMING SEVERAL LOW RISK CARDIAC PROCEDURES SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN AN ASP SEVEN. AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE WILL AUTHORIZE MEDICARE CERTIFIED AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA TO PERFORM ELECTIVE CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES. WITHOUT THIS STATUTORY UPDATE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND PATIENTS ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE OPTIONS. AND THE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS QUALITY OF CARE AND CONVENIENCE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS STRAINED THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND HAS EXACERBATED MANY ISSUES AROUND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WERE ALREADY PRESENT. AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE PROVIDES ANOTHER OPTION FOR LOW RISK PATIENTS TO RECEIVE CARE. AB THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE PRIORITIZE HEALTHCARE ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND PATIENT SAFETY. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO THESE SPECIFIED ELECTIVES CARDIAC PROCEDURES WHILE REDUCING OVERALL HEALTHCARE COSTS AND DEMAND ON SERVICES. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL WHICH WILL FURTHER ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY REQUIRING THAT AFC'S COMPLY WITH THIS GUY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THE SPONSORS TO PROTECT PATIENT. AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HELP. TESTIFYING VIA PHONE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. OUR PRICE DOUGHERTY FROM THE CALIFORNIA AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS. AND THE FOREIGN SHELL FROM THE SURGICAL CARE AFFILIATES. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR- WILL HAVE THE MODERATOR GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE PHONE LINES THIS FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALWAYS NEXT LINE IN THE MAIN ARE OPEN MR DOUGHERTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE BREAK DOUGHERTY WITH KATIE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA INVENTORY SURGERY ASSOCIATION ANSWER THE BABY THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. AS DR ARAMBULA MENTIONED THIS BILL ALLOWS MANDATORY SURGERY CENTER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS NANCY THAT IS CERTIFIED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS A MASS. REFORM DIAGNOSTIC INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES SUCH AS BY INJECTIONS DETECTOR TYRAEL BLOCKAGES AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS DANGER PLASTIC AND STANDING UPON APPROVAL OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT CONSISTENT WITH JOINT GUIDELINES PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. THE SOCIETY FOR CARDIOVASCULAR ANGIOGRAPHY AND INTERVENTIONS. AND THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. EACH JOY OUT OF MY THE DRESS ISSUES A PATIENTS. STAFFING EQUIPMENT NEEDS AND VARIOUS OTHER SAFETY CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE THE THEIR SEATS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT QUALITY OUTCOMES THE NATIONAL CARDIO VASCULAR REGISTRIES AND CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE PROCEDURES ARE PREVENTATIVE IN NATURE LOW RISK LIFESAVING AND ALREADY BEING DONE IN A IF YOU TO CROSS THE COUNTRY. RARELY DO WE FIND OURSELVES BEHIND OCCUR WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICARE POLICY OFTENTIMES IN CALIFORNIA ENTER INNOVATIVE AND FORWARD THINKING MIND SET THAT PUSHES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION. DATA FROM THE NATIONAL VASCULAR DATA REGISTRY REVEAL THAT MAJOR COMPLICATIONS AFTER THESE INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES ARE RARE AND EXCEEDINGLY SO THE ELECTIVE AND NON EMERGENT PROCEDURES AUTHORIZED UNDER AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS TV CALIFORNIA ARE REGULATED UNDER A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF NATIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS OVERSEEN BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. STATE LICENSURE CRITERIA ADMINISTERED BY GED PH AND THE NATIONAL MEDICARE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS ALSO REVIEWED ADMINISTERED AND ENFORCED BY C. PH. AS THESE ARE ROUTINELY AND SAFELY PERFORMING PROCEDURES THAT DON'T REQUIRE PATIENT TO STAY IN THAT FACILITY FROM LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SUCH AS TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT AND SPINE SURGERY. CALIFORNIA AGENCIES ARE PROVIDING YOU SERVICES AT A MUCH LOWER COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IMPATIENCE SITES OF SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE UC BERKELEY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT EVERY PROCEDURE PERFORMED AND NANCY SAVE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM 40% AND SAVE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES 5260% IN THEIR COPAYMENTS. SPECIFIC SYMMETRICAL THE PAGE MILLION ACOSTA. FOR THE PROGRAM AND FIVE MILLION AND PATIENT CO PAY COST SAVINGS IT JUST 5% OF THESE CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES SHIFTED THE A FC SETTING. WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYONE FEELS THE SAME WAY EVER AS STRONGLY AS WE DO ABOUT AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO WALK YOUR CONCERNS WITH A OPPOSITION ABOUT THIS APPROACH THERE ARE MORE THAN WILLING AND LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO- HOPEFUL WE CAN REACH A RESOLUTION THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIANS. IN NEED OF CARE. THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS HAS SHUT DOWN ALL LIKE TO PROCEDURES AND HAS DIVERTED MUCH OF OUR RESOURCES. ONLY NOW ARE WE STARTING TO RE OPEN OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE COLLECTIVE NON EMERGENT AND PREVENTATIVE SERVICE. WE ARE ALREADY WITNESSING IMMENSE PENT UP DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND EXISTING CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY. WILL HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTY. IN MEETING THIS DEMAND. EVEN BEFORE KOBE NINE. CARDIOLOGY PHYSICIAN A CALL WORK. ABOUT THE ACT TO CARE FOR THESE LAW. TREATMENT THE PAST. BERNIE HAS BECOME A NATIONAL LEADER IN EXPANDING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE ALMOST ALL RESIDENTS. BUT ACCESS TO GET TO THAT CARE AND THE COST OF PROVIDING IT REMAINS A MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE. THE COVERT NINETEEN HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING. IT'S THAT WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THERE'S A HEALTHCARE CRISIS TO ENSURE. THAT OUR CAPACITY TO MEET PATIENT NEEDS IS SUFFICIENT. WHAT'S GOING ALL OF US TALK A LOT ABOUT WANTING AND NEEDING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE WHILE ALSO DELIVERING ACOSTA SAVINGS. WHILE ALSO CONCURRENTLY MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL QUALITY CARE THAT PATIENTS SIR. THIS BILL STRIKE THAT BALANCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND FOR ALL THE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR ARE VOTE AND MAYBE THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. BUT WE HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND I WOULD ASK PLEASE AS WITNESSES TO STICK TO OUR THREE MINUTES- I DON'T WANT TO PENALIZE OF A FURTHER FEATURE WITNESS BUT WE WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITING ALL TESTIMONY TO SIX MINUTES SO IF THE FIRST WITNESS GOES OVER. THE SECOND WITNESS SUFFERS SO- I WON'T DO THAT TO THIS NEXT WITNESS BUT I PLEASE ASK YOU THIS IS A DIFFICULT FORMAT IN WHICH TO WORK AND SO PLEASE.

AND WE ALSO HAVE THESE CARDIO VASCULAR AGENCIES ACROSS THE NATION IN A PRIOR JOB. I ALSO OVERSIGHT AND- CARDIOLOGY CENTERS IN THE NATION WHERE WE PARTNERED WITH PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS AND- BUILDING AND MANAGING THE SURGERY CENTERS WITH GREAT OUTCOMES. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AB THIRTY EIGHTY THREE WILL LOWER THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR PATIENTS. WITH GOVERNMENT PAYERS FOR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. WHILE BITING HIGH QUALITY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. WE WILL ALSO ACHIEVE INCREASED PATIENT SATISFACTION INCREASED PHYSICIAN SATISFACTION AND INCREASED ACCESS FOR ALL PATIENT GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ALIKE.

AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING ON TO OPPOSITION THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM. YES OKAY PLEASE GO AHEAD. A GOOD MORNING CARE MEMBERS NOT WAS A ON BEHALF OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS OF SCA YOU CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO EAT THIRTY THREE. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL PRIMARILY IN ITS CURRENTLY IN ITS CURRENT FORM FOR FOUR REASONS- FIRST THE RISK TO PATIENTS DUE TO THE LACK OF- PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS AND AGENCIES. SECOND THE UNKNOWN CONSEQUENCES TO THE NEW FEDERAL SAFETY REGULATIONS THIRD THE LACK OF EVIDENCE OF ACCESS TO CARE IF SHE'S BEEN FOR CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURES PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND FOURTH CONCERNS ABOUT PATIENT REFERRALS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL SELF ME. DEALING AMONG PHYSICIANS. CARDIAC AFTER IS THE EVEN DIED WANTS TO CARRY WITH THEM SIGNIFICANT RISK OF COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING STROKE HEART ATTACK UNCONTROLLABLY LEADING AND KIDNEY FAILURE MANY OF THESE COMPLICATIONS CAN SHOW UP AFTER THE PROCEDURE WHILE THE PATIENT IS STILL RECOVERING WHEN THE PHYSICIAN IS NO LONGER ON SITE. PATIENT SAFETY MUST BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN WHEN CONSIDERING ALLOWING THESE- CENTERS TO PERFORM PROCEDURES THERE TYPICALLY DONE IN HOSPITALS HOSPITALS HAVE THEIR PER- PERSONALITY PLACE TO REACT QUICKLY DURING AN EMERGENCY- IN CASE THE PATIENT IS IN NEED. THE CENTERS OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICE APPROVED THESE PROCEDURES THAT SURGICAL CENTERS DESPITE SIMILARLY STRONG AND THAT JACKSON'S FROM ADVOCATES. ABOUT THE RISKS- TO PATIENTS DURING THE PROCEDURES AND DURING THE RECOVERY CMS NOTED DURING THE- ISSUANCE OF REGULATIONS THAT MAJORITY OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES MAY NOT BE SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO RECEIVE THESE PROCEDURES AND A S. C. SAT. HOWEVER AS CMS MOVIES REGULATIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO DRAMATICALLY LOOSEN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR ASC INCLUDING LOSING THAT LOOSENING THE REQUIREMENTS THE AFC REVIEW THEIR HERDS THE PREPAREDNESS PLAN EVERY YEAR. AND ALSO REMOVING THE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL THREE REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH PATIENT. THESE ARE JUST THE SORT OF SAFE GUARDS- TO HELP KEEP PATIENTS SAFE WHEN COMPLICATIONS ARISE AND- SOMETHING WE WOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER AT IMPORTANT CLUES IN THE BILL- IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO SHARE THE WALL WE ALSO SHIP ALL OF IMPROVING ACCESS CARE. YES AN ANSWER HE- HAVING. THIS NONSTICK PROCEDURES OUT OF THE CRISIS IF I TO THESE PROCEDURES THE SENATE PROBLEM PLEASE THE DAY THAT SHOW THE LENGTH OF DELAY WITH ARE HAVING ACCESSING CARE. LAST WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AND WORRY ABOUT THE OF FINANCIAL pSELF YOU. FOR OWN VAST OF SEASON POWER. AND PHYSICIAN WHILE THE PHYSICIAN IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THIS FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO PATIENTS. WE WORRY THAT THESE DISCLOSURES ARE OFTEN NOT ADEQUATE TO ENSURE THAT PATIENT IS THAT THE PATIENT IS GIVEN CARE ON A GREAT SET. IN SUMMARY OUR CONCERNS ARE BASED ON PATIENT SAFETY LOCK EVIDENCE OF ACCESS TO CARE AND LASTLY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE GETTING CARE AND THE APPROPRIATE SETTING. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND IT STOPS CONCERNS WITH ACCESS TO CARE AND- THEY'RE OFFERING WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES TOGETHER. ON PROPER WE MUST TEENY THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THE VOTE NO ON E. THIRTY EIGHTY THREE. THANK YOU AND WITH ME TODAY IS JOHN ALLEN FROM SEIU U. S. W.

B. THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX. HELLO OKAY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX A CRITICAL BILL THAT WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AGAINST FOOD CONTAMINATION FROM READY TO EAT DELIVERY SERVICES BY ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES SAFEGUARD THE IMPORTANCE OF AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX WHICH MY OFFICE HAD BEGUN WORKING BEFORE. THE NINETEEN OUTBREAK IS HEIGHTENED EVEN MORE IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE NEW REALITIES. WEARING FACE MASKS SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SHELTERING IN PLACE. AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN AT HOME DELIVERIES HAVE SKYROCKETED AS OUR RESTAURANTS WERE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN AND THE PUBLIC WAS ORDERED TO SHELTER IN PLACE AND MANDATE WHICH IN MY DISTRICT OF LOS ANGELES IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT UNTIL JULY. LUCKILY FOR DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN HAVE ENABLED MANY RESTAURANTS TO REMAIN OPEN FOR BUSINESS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME THERE IS LITTLE QUESTION THAT COBRA NINETEEN AND OTHER VIRUSES CAN BE SPREAD THROUGH FOOD AND THE HANDLING OF FOOD PACKAGING. UNFORTUNATELY SANITATION STANDARDS DO NOT EXIST FOR UP DELIVERY DRIVERS MANY OF WHOM HAVE COME ON BOARD DURING A TIME OF SKYROCKETED-UNEMPLOYMENT AT A TIME LIKE THIS IT IS THE TREMENDOUS ALL THAT FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES ARE CONDUCTED IN A SAFE MANNER. AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX WILL PROVIDE BASIC PROTECTIONS AGAINST FOOD CONTAMINATION BY ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING BASIC FOOD HANDLER TRAINING FOR ALL DRIVERS TO ENSURE BASIC FOOD SAFETY PROTECTIONS WITH AN INFLUX OF FOOD WHAT THE NEW INFLUX OF NEW DELIVERY DRIVERS AND A LACK OF SAFETY PROTOCOLS THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IDENTIFICATION AVAILABLE FIRST A PERSON'S RECEIVING TRANSPORTING AND DELIVERING THE FOOD IN ORDER TO ALLOW HEALTH OFFICIALS TO TRACE BACK ANY COMPLAINTS OR VIOLATIONS. SAMPER EVIDENT CLOSER A FOOD CONTAINER OF THAT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE TAPE LABELS OR STAPLES. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND COST RECOVERY FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WELL I RECOGNIZE THIS BILL MAY NOT GUARANTEE 1100% SAFETY COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED MINIMUM STATE STANDARD AND AB THIRTY THREE THREE THIRTY SIX WILL CERTAINLY ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL AT THIS TIME. I RECOGNIZE THE MANY FOOD DELIVERY APPS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE STEPS TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH AS A RESPONSE TO PULL THE NINETEEN. FOR EXAMPLE WILL BREED HAS SHARE TIPS WITH RESTAURANT OWNERS AND DELIVERY DRIVERS ON SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMS WELL THEY WORK TO PROVIDE SANITATION PRODUCTS TO ITS DRIVER'S. DOOR DASH HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED HAS ALSO PROVIDED MILLIONS OF FACEMASK TO THEIR DRIVERS AND HAS DISTRIBUTED HAD BEEN A TIES AND GLOVES WE'LL MAKE A COPY SELECT IT'S THE FAULT. OUR INTENT IS TO BILL ON THE- NOT BY FOR THEM. AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX SIX TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. NOT TO CLOSE DOWN OR MAKE IT BUSINESS ON REASONABLY HARD FOR THESE PLATFORMS OR OTHER READY TO EAT DELIVERY. DELIVERY READY TO EAT FOOD. WE SIMPLY NEED CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. AND A TIME OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DETRIMENT. THOUGH THE OPPOSITION LETTERS DOES NOT KNOW OF THIS EFFORT MY OFFICE AND OUR SPONSORS HAVE ENGAGED IN ONGOING OPPOSITION AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION. SEEKING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. ON WORKABLE PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT DRIVERS HAVE THE MOST BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD SAFETY. PROVIDING TESTABLE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OUR MATSON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND JUSTIN ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BELIEVE WE HAVE TO ON THE PHONE. MR MODERATING MAY OPEN THOSE LINES ARE LONGER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. YES MORNING MOST CHARACTER HELLO I'M HERE WITH THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STOCK VERY MUCH WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT. I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR HAS PROVIDE UP TO SENDING OVER THE YEARS THAT THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY CONQUERED THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BUILD ON NUMBER READY GOOD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BUT THERE IS AN IMPERATIVE TO HAVE A MINIMUM STATEWIDE GADGETS AND EIGHT EACH STRANGELY ACT YOU HAVE. A CAPACITY TO BE TRACED BACK TO PROBLEMS OCCUR- THE FULL CO THE THIS WAS AN ISSUE TO SEE CAMPAIGN EVIDENCE BAG AND UP 228% OF DRIVERS ADMITTED CALVING SPECTRUM THE FOOD AND THE DRINKS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DELIVERING IT HAVE BEEN THE END REMAINS OF FOOD SAFETY ISSUE COVERT MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. I WANT TO CUT TO THE CHASE HERE BECAUSE AS THE AUTHOR SO ACCURATELY STATED WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH MOST OF THE ACT THANK ACT BASED GROUPS A PLATFORM THAT THEY CALLED INCLUDING IS TO CART. AND WE HAVE HOPE COULD WITH THEM THAT WE HAVE TO ISSUES. TO ADDRESS. I ALL AT THE ALTAR HAS ALSO ALLUDED. AN ASP. WE COMMIT FORTY TO WORKING ON THE THREE HOUR STAND ISSUES AND I AM VERY KHôNG TO THAT WE CAN IT THEM. TO THE SET. OF THOSE THAT THE WORKS WITH. VERY SIMPLY WE CAN FIND A WAY OF PROVIDE THAT IN. THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE WHO'D HAVE A **** WITH ACTUALLY AT. REQUIRING THE CARD ITSELF. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS FOR COMMERCIAL DELIVERY VEHICLES. ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO PASSAGE OF VEHICLES BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO INSIST. THAT THE VEHICLES ARE. LEADING UP TO THE BILL AND FINALLY THIS IS A INTENDED TO GROW STORES THEY JUST AND ELSE. WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT WE MOVE FORWARD TO CLARIFY THAT THE MINIMALIST DELIVERY OF READY TO EAT FOODS ALONG WITH GROCERY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE COVERED WITH THIS BILL. BUT THERE'S AN URGENCY BECAUSE IT IS AFTER THE FIGHT THE NEED FOR THIS WEEK THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WE CAN LOOK TO WORK WITH ANYONE WITH CONCERNS AND WE THANK YOU'LL STOP VERY MUCH. HE FALL IN THAT THEY HAVE THE SAID THE TO PRINT THE PATH HEALTH DURING THIS THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. ON THE PHONE MORNING AIR MATT MATT THAT THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU- YES WE ARE SUPPORT OF THE BILL OF VERY FEW INDUSTRIES- IS REGULATING THAT THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY- AND IN LARGE PART PORTION OF THAT. GOVERNING LAW THAT'S ON THE BOOKS TO DAME THAT PUBLIC HEALTH. SO NOBODY'S BETTER TRAINED IN CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT FOOD SERVICE TEAM MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO DAY FOOD HANDLING PREPARATION AND SERVICE TO THE CONSUMING PUBLIC. THE FOOD A PLANE IS NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF ANY RESTAURANT OPERATOR AND AT THAT TO SAFETY AND THE TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. TO GIVE RESTAURANTS AND GET THE CONFIDENCE TO RETURN ONCE RESTAURANT. WITHOUT THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH COULD BE COMPROMISED AND ONE WOULD LIKELY DAMAGE THE RESTAURANT REPUTATION WHICH OF COURSE NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE CUSTOMER BASE AND THE EMPLOYEE. SO FOR FOOD SAFETY IT'S A NO BRAINER FOR US THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND AS MISTER MALONE DATED. AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN CARILLO THIS DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE LONG BEFORE CO COULD NINETEEN AND WILL CONTINUE AFTER CODE NINETEEN. ANY OF YOU MEMBERS CAN. BEING LARGE. WHETHER THEIR SUPPLIERS ARE PURVEY THAT THE OF A RESTAURANT LOADING FOOD AND- AND TO BUY INTO THE RESTAURANT. RESTAURANTS ARE REGULATED FROM THE TIME THAT FOOD ENTERS THE BACKDOOR. THOSE THROUGH THE RESTAURANT TERMS OF FOOD PREPARATION IN TERMS OF COOKING AND EVERY STEP OF THE WAY IN THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM. AND OUT THE DOOR FOR TAKE OUT ORDERS FOR GAP. BUT IT IS NOT TRUE FOR THE DELIVERY ASPECT THAT TAKES PLACE ONCE A FOOD ORDER LEAVES THE FRONT DOOR OF A RESTAURANT. THE LAST FEW MILES BEFORE CONSUMER GET THEIR FOOD ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE SAME HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT YOU HAVE WITHIN THE RESTAURANT FOR FOOD HANDLERS. NOT THE VEHICLE THE FOODS BEING TRANSPORTED IN OR THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSPORTING THE FRUIT. SO THIS REALLY LOOK TO GETTING SOME BASIC FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE IN THAT AND- IN FACT MUCH OF THE TRAINING IN THE FOOD SERVICE. THAT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN LAW ARE GOOD PRODUCT OF THIS HEALTH COMMITTEE AND YOUR GOOD WORK MISTER CHAIR THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND JUST LAST YEAR- ANOTHER BILL BY THE MOON. THE BACK OF BAUER-KAHAN LOOKS TO EXTEND SOME OF THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS DECEMBER K. SO AGAIN THE BILL SIMPLY EXTENT THAT COULD WORK A PLANE JUST TO THE DELIVERY OF PORTION OF FOOD SERVICE THAT INCLUDES OUR OWN FOOD DELIVERY WITHIN RESTAURANTS AS WELL A THIRD PARTIES- AND SO. THE TRAINING THINK POSTED IT PORTABLE BELONGED TO THE EMPLOYEE IT'S AFFORDABLE AND IT'S WIDELY ACCESSIBLE ON THE INTERNET- THE RESTAURANT CAN DO ALL THEY CAN IN THE RESTAURANT TO MANAGE FOOD SAFETY- AND THEN YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES BECAUSE IT'S FRANKLY ALARMING THAT THERE'S NO REGULATION. ONE LEAVES THE CUSTODY OF THE RESTAURANT AND THEN END UP IN THE HANDS OF A GET. THE DISCUSSION STARTED LAST FALL IN LA COUNTY WITH SUPERVISORS LOOKING INTO DOING A LOCAL WORKING ON THIS EXACT SAME IDEA- MISTER. MALONE IN THE NUMBER OF THE- PROFESSIONAL UP THE PART REP. AND OTHERS. COME AND- DECISION WAS LARGELY FROM THE HELP PUBLIC- OFFICIALS THAT DOING THIS ON A REGION BY REGION BASIS DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND WE SHOULD LOOK FEELING AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT THOSE LAST FEW UNREGULATED MILES. I HAVE SOME BASIC LEVEL TO HELP THE STATE TO STANDARDS APPLY TO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OTHER ANY WITH ANY OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM. SCENE NINE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT MISTER MODERATOR ME OPEN THE LINES ARE JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT ON THE AUDIO HOTLINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD BOOK ONLINE NUMBER NINETY FOUR THAT NINE FOUR. GO AHEAD YOU'RE LIKE IT'S OPEN. YOUNGER LEGAL IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE ONE MORE WITH A AN OPERATOR ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AB ORDER LINE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TWO ZERO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. NO MORE ON THE AUDIO PHONE LINES VERY GOOD THANK YOU- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- WE HAVE TO ON THE PHONE. THE OPN THOSE WILL OPEN THOSE LINES WHEN WHENEVER. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CORPS IN JENSEN ATTACK THAT DAY IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY THREE THIRTY THREE SEC THINKING AND CUSTOMER TRACK WITH A TOP PRIORITY FOR TECH THAT MEMBER COMPANIES AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORED RECOGNITION OF EFFORT COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN. RIGHT BATES EIGHTEEN MEASURES. FOR THE THROUGH DATE REX THE JOHN PUBLIC WHEN THE WITH THAT TYPE DELIVERY. AND COMPANIES ALL EMPLOY IDEA MY DURING THE OVERNIGHT THE INFECTED CON WITH DELIVERY AND PROVIDE GUY IN THE DRIVERS IF THEY- TO STATE THEY AND DURING PACKED AND ANYTIME. IMPACTED BY THAT THEY'LL HAVE ALSO BEEN BEING JUST PROVIDING AN ESSENTIAL. DURING THE- BECAUSE THEY HAVE HELPED ENSURE CAL HAVE ACCESS TO GROCERIES AND YELLED FROM LOCAL RESTAURANTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAD A GOOD INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE BILL AND DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THAT. WAGE I DO WANT SHARE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL AND RAN AND BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE USE OF PERSONAL VEHICLE FOR BILL DELIVERY. ENERGY NEW BARRIERS THAT FOR THE TYPE OF WORK AND- TO DELIVER COMPANY AND DRY. TO MEANT FOR MANY. AND RETAILERS AB THREE THREE THREE SIX ONE APPLY TO- DELIVERY COMPANIES AND DRIVERS- WHO DELIVER READY TO EAT FOOD ANY GOOD FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. I APPRECIATE THE- COMMENTS. ARE OUT I. GROCERY FROM THE BELL AND YEAH CURRENTLY IN THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD IMPACT. RADIATE THROUGH DELAY FROM GROCERY STORES. WHICH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I DO KNOW WHEN YOU A GREAT ABOUT WHEN CONSUMER. ORDERS EIGHT DELIVERY FROM STORE THERE ARE WE IN ORDER A MAKE BACK THE CONTENT READY AT REPACKAGE THE AND NOT THE VERY. AND THE CONTACT BUT THIS WOULD ALSO AND- READY TO EAT WE WERE DOING FROM ANY OTHER FOOD FACILITY IN HOW THE BILL WOULD. DELIVERY DRIVER TO BE INCLUDING AND CAR WHICH WE BELIEVE BE A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR CALIFORNIANS LEARNING. A LOOKING TO EARN EXTRA MONEY THE PROCESS OF GETTING A FOOD HANDLER CARD IS ABOUT A TWO HOUR PROCESS. AND REQUIRED PACKING A FORTY QUESTION TEST FOCUS ON HOW WE SHOULD BE PREPARED AND SERVED IN A RESTAURANT. OR THE KITCHEN DELI AND THE GROCERY STORE THE INTENT OF THE FOOD HANDLER CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR WORKERS AT RESTAURANTS. AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE FOOD ACTUALLY. BEING WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR DRIVERS TO ARE ACTING HALF AND THE YEAH. AND SIMPLY BECAUSE AND- FOOD TO DELAY OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOW TEN OPS TURN MONEY ESPECIALLY DURING TIME AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEATH HER TO. HAD THE BILL DRIVER COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ROADBLOCK FOR MANY IN. LOOK BECAUSE AND WE ALSO HAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE PER. AND BELL AND ACROSS RECKLESS REALLY TO CATCH. HIM AND BUT I BELIEVE MISTER POWER WITH THE AT THE REGIONAL BE COVERING THOSE. DAHLE AND THERE AND THINK YOU MISTER FOR THE AND WE LOOK FORWARD WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ONE OF THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRINT WILL FADE GARDEN- THAT WE ARE THE IMPACT OF THE CELL- WOULD BE YEAH I'M NOT. MAKING IT ROADBLOCK TO THIS TYPE OF DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU NAY WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT CALLAGHAN WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB THREE THREE THREE SIX OF BLACK TECH OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISSTEPS AND ADD A FEW ADDITIONAL PROVIDE US. CAN CONCERN ABOUT FIRST AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX WOULD ELIMINATE THE USE OF PERSONAL VEHICLES FOR FOOD DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS BECAUSE THE DON'T PRINT WHICH SUBJECT THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY TO A REQUIREMENT TO KEEP HOLDING AREA OF THE VEHICLE BE CONSTRUCTED IN A SMOOTH THE WASHABLE IMPERVIOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING FREQUENT CLEANING- TO COMPLY DELIVERY DRIVERS WOULD LIKELY NEED COMMERCIAL BANDS OR TRAILERS NOT THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLES. AT THIS WHAT IT REASONABLY ELIMINATE THE DRIVER USER PERSONAL VEHICLE- WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD COMPLETELY DISRUPT THIRD PARTY TO DELIVERY- AT A TIME FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE RELY ON IT MORE THAN EVER AB AND WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE WHAT SPORTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON THESE PLATFORMS TO PAY BILLS PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE OTHER PROVISION I WANTED TO FLAG WAS THERE ARE THE BILL REQUIRES YOU TO BE MAKING A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE TECH FROM TAMPA. CURRENT THE SECOND SEPHORA WERE FOR MANY BACK A BRA OF FOOD AND WHEN TRANSIT FOODS AND DISK SO AND READ OKAY DELIVERY DO ENGAGE IN ANY TO PROD AND IT'S REAL TO ASK DELIVERY DRIVERS TO COMPLY THE REGULAR THAT MAP BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME TO ACTUALLY REACH. IT SEEMS THE BILL MISAPPLIED TO REQUIREMENTS TO PROCESS WHICH BASICALLY MAKES IT CAN START CUSTOMER TAKING GROCERIES OR PREFERRED PREPARED FOOD HOME AND SO THEY'RE NOT ONLY THAT BUT NECESSARY- BUT WORKABLE AS WELL SO FOR THESE REASONS ARE WORKERS SB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX- BUT- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. AFTER THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY OTHER ENOUGH. THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM. SEE NO ONE MISTER MODERATE YOU MAY OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF JUST THEIR NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. YES IF YOU'RE ON THE AUDIO PHONE LINES IN WHICH TO VOICE OPPOSITION IN A PRESS ONE MAN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE ON THE AUDIO PHONE LINES AT THIS TIME. I TAKE THAT BACK BECAUSE OF ONE THAT JUST CUED UP. ONE MOMENT PLEASE OKAY. DAVID AF WITHDRAWN THEIR OPPOSITION TO SPEAK SO YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SCENE NINE WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE MISS KOREA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE- THE COMMENTS BOTH IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WANTED TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS. THE FOR DELIVERY DRIVERS USING THE APPS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO USE THEIR VEHICLES WHAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE IS THAT. IF YOU ARE HANDLING ANY TYPE OF READY TO EAT FOOD THAT YOUR VEHICLE IS SIMPLY CLEAN. SO IF YOU HAVE A PART TIME JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE YOU ARE A MECHANIC AND MAYBE YOU HAVE YOUR TOOLS IN YOUR CAR. THEN THE SUGGESTION IS. YOU SHOULDN'T PUT FOOD THAT'S READY TO EAT THAT'S GOING TO BE DELIVERED TO WELCOME A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER. NEXT TO YOUR DIRTY TOOLS THESE ARE BASIC HEALTH STANDARDS THAT RESTAURANTS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. THE WEEK WE HOLD SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL RESTAURANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STANDARDS. THAN WE DO THE PEOPLE TO DELIVER THE FOOD THAT WE ARE ALL CONSUMING. I USE THE APPS I'VE USED THEM IN THE PAST I ALSO GO DOWN TO THE RESTAURANTS AND DURING FULL OF IT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS MY DISTRICT. THAT ARE DOING DELIVERY SERVICES AT CURBSIDE. ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A STANDARD. STATEWIDE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IN ADDITIONAL BE. FOOD SAFETY HANDLER TEST THAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IS BURDENSOME IT'S EIGHT DOLLARS AND IS AVAILABLE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND IT TAKES TWO HOURS TO COMPLETE. THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS MORE FEASIBLE THAT CREATES AN UNDERSTANDING FOR DRIVERS THAT DELIVER READY TO EAT FOOD TO UNDERSTAND BASIC. FOOD SAFETY. IN THE VEHICLES AS THEY DELIVER FOOD TO FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WE WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. THE FOR COAL IT. WAS EVEN AT THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. IN FACT. FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES ARE ONLY GOING TO INCREASE BY 4% FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS NPR SURVEYED SAID THAT 28% OF DRIVERS. ADMITTED THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A BITE OUT OF THE FOOD OF THE FOODS THAT THEY DELIVER. TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IF YOU'VE ORDERED A BURGER AND SOME FRIES AND HALF YOUR FRIES ARE GONE. IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PERSON DELIVERING IT WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU'RE BAD ACTUALLY WITH THE OLD. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY YOUR FOOD BEING CONTAMINATED THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. IN ADDITION THE SAME SERVICE SAID THAT 85% OF CUSTOMERS OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THEIR FOOD BE CLOSED EITHER BY TAPE BY STAPLES OR WHATEVER IS NECESSARY. SO THIS IS A BILL THAT ENSURES PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE SET A STANDARD. PROCESS CALIFORNIA. NOW NEED MORE. AND IS THE OF GOVERNMENT TRY TO CATCH UP YEARS FROM NOW. WHY DON'T WE DO IT NOW IN TANDEM WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IBOOK THANK. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND SECOND. OKAY MOTION BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ A SECOND BY MISS- MISS THE MON THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS I WILL NOTE THAT WE DID HEAR THAT THE PROPONENTS WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT BUT THAT ISN'T IN OUR COMMITTEE SO WE JUST ASK THAT THE OFFER CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IN THAT REGARD- WITH THAT THE MOTION IS PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX DO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS WOULD I WOULD I MAYES. MAYES NO AGUILAR CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY NOT VOTING BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO BONTA BONTA I BURKE. CORREO CARILLO I FLORA. FLORA NO. LEMOND LIMóN I MCCARTY. NAZARIAN RAMOS. RAMOS NOT VOTING RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO. WALDRON WALDRON NOW. VOTE IS FIVE FOR BILL IS ON CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL MOVE ON THEN TO THE NEXT BILL MR CHOW. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY WITH BRING HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED BY FDA APPROVED APPS USE AT THE DIRECTION OF A POSITION TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PRIVACY LAW. THE FDA HAS RECENTLY STREAMLINED THE PROCESS BY WHICH SHOWED DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS OR APPROVED. GIVING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ALL ALREADY IN USE. THESE PILLS COMBINED INJECTABLE MICROCHIP SENSORS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATCH THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION AND SINCE IT. TO AN OUT SIMILAR TO A FIFTY. THIS PRODUCT CAN RECORD THE TIME IN QUANTITY THE DRUG IS TAKEN THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE PERSON HIS BODY TEMPERATURE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE. BUT FOR DATA TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT LAW HE NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. IN THIS CASE SINCE THE INFORMATION IS GENERATED BY DIGITAL HEALTHSOUTH SUCH AS THE DIGITAL SKILLS WERE IT IS COLLECTED OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY AND ALSO AT THE PATIENT LEVEL. IT WILL NOT BE CAPTURE UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING GIVEN THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC SPREAD. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE LOOKING TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS INCLUDING GREATER USE OF DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. RAISING SIGNIFICANT PATIENT PRIVACY CONCERNS. ALREADY THE INVASIVE USE OF IDENTIFIABLE GEO LOCATION INFORMATION BY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED SUGGESTING THAT. APPROPRIATE GUARD RAILS THE NECESSARY TO PROTECT PRIVATELY COLLECTED INFORMATION WITH AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY TO PROTECT AGAINST OVER REACH. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE ENFORCEMENT OF PAPER PROVISIONS BEING SUSPENDED TO OF PERMITS SHARING OF HEALTH INFORMATION. FOLLOWING THIS CRISIS THERE IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANT DEMAND FOR DIGITAL HEALTH SYSTEM INFORMATION FOR RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH. FOR EXAMPLE A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY COULD USE DIGITAL HEALTH INFORMATION PURCHASE FROM ADDITIONAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM OPERATOR TO INFER INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTRACTED COVERT NINETEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SEPARATES FOR PREMIUMS BASED ON THIS INFORMATION. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT UNDER C. M. I. A. I PREVENT PROVIDING THAT ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN OUT. OR DEVICE TO A CONSUMER SHALL BE DEEMED A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA GENERATED BY THESE DIGITAL TALES IS TREATED WITH THE SAME CARE AS DATA THAT IS GENERATED IN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING. AND THAT INFORMATION WON'T BE SURE WITHOUT PATIENTS WRITTEN CONSENT. WONDERFUL TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS REBEKAH OPENS UP GONZALEZ WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU MUCH MISTER CHARLIE HAVE WITNESS AND. HELLO MY NAME IS WORK ACT AND SALAS AND I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE DEGREE FROM AN ACCREDITED SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THEMSELVES WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

ONE WITH OUTPATIENT AND THEN ONE WITH IN PATIENTS ALL START WITH NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX UPDATED EXPAND SOME ASPECTS OF LAURA'S LAW LAURA'S LAW HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO. AND THAT LOBBY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THAT- YOUNG MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WH WAS KILLED BY A PATIENT. WHO WAS NOT AT THAT PARTICIPATING ADEQUATELY WITH TREATMENT- FROM THEM. SO ADVANCED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS THE MOST AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- AND OFTEN TIMES EVEN WHEN FACED IDEA HAVE HAVE A MANDATED PEOPLE WILL GO INTO TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY. SO THIS IS THE ACCOUNT AND CURRENTLY. ONLY UP TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. IN THIS HEALTH TWENTY COUNTIES HAVE OPTED IN. THIS THIS YEAR WILL SAY THAT ALL COUNTIES WILL BE IMPLEMENT LOWERS LAW IN LESS THEY OPT OUT SO COUNTIES CAN STILL OPT OUT IF THEY SO CHOOSE THIS BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT MONEY THEN USED FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT WILL NOT TAKE FROM CHILDREN SERVICES OR OTHER ALREADY EXISTING SERVICES OR WILL BE REDUCTION. IN SERVICES FOR OTHER JUST ENHANCED SERVICES FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING WITH PERSISTENT AND SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH WHOSE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES PREVENT THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO VOLUNTARILY OFTENTIMES GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED- WE THIS ALSO WILL REGROUP REMOVED TO SUNSET THERE'S CURRENTLY STILL ON SET THE THREE NUDE EVERY COUPLE YEARS WE THINK THIS IS BEEN PILOT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS NOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT TIME. DO A PORT ON THIS AND TO TALK ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF IT- AND AS YOU ALL KNOW WE HEAR AND THEN SACRAMENTO DRIVING AROUND THE STREETS EVERYWHERE WE SEE THIS CRISIS EVERY DAY WITH OUR VERY OWN EYES AND OFTEN THINK WHAT DO I DO WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHO IS CLEARLY. HAVE CONVERSATION TO SOMETHING UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND LIVING ON OUR STREETS- THE IT IS IN LIGHT OF THIS THAT THIS BILL IS OFF TODAY. IT IS SPONSORED BY. THE IT'S LIKE GETTING TH SO. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK. RENTAL HAGAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. I MISTER NICK WILCOX FOR WHO- LORE HIS DAUGHTER WAS LARA. STARTED THE ACTUAL LAW. MEMBERS WILL RECALL WE HAD A- MOVING TRIBUTE AS HE AND HIS WIFE RETIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR SO THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST THING HE WANTED TO GET DONE. AND SO. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I WILL WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES AT THE PIER SO BOTH THE ON THE PHONE- THREE MINUTES EACH MR HAGAR PLEASE PROCEED WHEN OF MISTER MODERATOR ME OVER THE PHONE LINE. THE TRIGGER YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HEY ARE YOU MAY HAVE SELF MUTED WE'RE NOT HEARING YOU. NOT SO HELLO YEAH WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW OKAY SIR THANK YOU MISTER. A AND TAKE MEN AND- MISTER WILCOX- LAURA'S LAW IS- COURT SUPERVISED INTENSIVE TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY AND HA BEEN A FACTOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS- IT IS FUNNY COUNTIES THE STRENGTH OF A LAWRENCE LAW PROGRAM IS ENGAGING PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS HAVE DIFFICULT FINE ENGAGING AND TREATMENT. THE MOST OBVIOUS BENEFIT IS IN USE IRAQ'S HOSPITALIZATION AND INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE BUT OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC EQUAL. ON HOMELESSNESS THEY T. PROGRAMS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS HELP PATIENTS MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING AND THE CREEKS THAT HER AUNT'S THE MEDICATIONS THIS IMPROVES THEIR STABILITY AND THE COMMUNITY AT SUPPORTS RECOVERY AND THAT'S A ANTI HOMELESSNESS RIGHT OF MEASURE. THIS BILL DOES CHANGE THE PRESUMPTION THAT COUNTIES WOULD OFTEN ADD TO AN OPT OUT MODEL. BIT GOSH. BETTER THAN SURE IT HELLO. MINUTE CAN HAVE A CALM AND A VERY PUBLIC PRICE. READING MERITS OF THE FOR THERE TO WE THINK THE IS VERY. IT ALL ALLOWS IS FOR COUNTY THAT WANT pPROGRAM THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'S VERY PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. AND WE URGE YOU. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HAGAR OUR NEXT WAS WITNESS MISTER WILLCOX. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS NICOLE **** I'M CALLING IN THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE THE SUNSET CLAUSE FROM LARGE LAW AND REQUIRE COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW AND LASTLY AFFIRMATIVELY OPT OUT MY WIFE THE I HAVE FAULTS WITH THIS SENSE TO. WHEN LAW OFFICE FOR. UNDER CONSIDER IN THAT YEAR OUR DAUGHTER LAURA. WAS A VICTIM IN A RAMPAGE SHOOTING PERPETRATED BY A MAN WITH SEVERE UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS WE UNDERSTOOD EARLY ON THAT. MANY WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS DO NOT RECOGNIZE OR ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR CONDITION AND THEREFORE DO NOT ENGAGE IN TREATMENT. LARGE LAW WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A LEGAL STRUCTURE AND A TREATMENT PROGRAM TO ENGAGE SUCH INDIVIDUALS. WE ENCOUNTERED STRONG OPPOSITION AT THAT TIME. IN ORDER TO MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER HELEN THOMPSON THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF AB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AGREE TO A FIVE YEAR SUNSET CLAUSE IN OUR OWN COUNTY NEVADA COUNTY- IT WAS THE FIRST COUNTY. TO FULLY IMPLEMENT LARGE LAW AND SINCE THEN MANY COUNTIES HAVE FOLLOWED. NOW OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIANS LIVING COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE LAW. THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXTENDED THE SUNSET ON THREE OCCASIONS SINCE THAT. THE BAD OUTCOMES THAT OPPONENTS PREDICTED AT THE OUTSET HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED IN OUR COUNTY THE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WE HAD ENVISIONED WITH REDUCTIONS IN HOSPITALIZATION. INCARCERATIONS AND HOMELESSNESS ORDER ORDER ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZED AS FREQUENTLY AS WE HAD EXPECTED AS ABOUT COUNTY HAS FOUND THAT IN OVER 50% OF CASES THE COURT ORDERS ARE NECESSARY AND PEOPLE ENGAGING TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HOPE FOR AFTER ALL THE PRIMARY GOAL OF LARGE LAWS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN LONG TERM TREATMENT SO THEY MAY START ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. WE BELIEVE THE LARGE LAW HAS NOW PROVEN ITSELF AND THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE IT PERMANENT AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO EVEN MORE CALIFORNIANS. FIGHTING QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IS THE HUMANE THINGTO DO. AND IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SOCIETY. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. PEOPLE OF APPROACHED AMANDA NOT AND THANKED US.

THOSE YOU WANNA A HOUSING WHERE YOU'RE AND GO. HOPEFULLY NOT LATER THIS WEEK THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE R. LPS PROCESS SO CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IF YOU IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO CARE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER YOU'RE DANGEROUS PEOPLE KNOW THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY CRITERIA YOU ARE ABLE TO BE HELD AGAINST YOUR WILL FOR A PERIOD OF THREE DAYS. FOR STABLE XIN. THAT THREE DAYS AND THEN IN OR TO BE ABLE TO HOLD SOMEBODY FOR TWO WEEKS. WE FIND THAT IS WHER THE BIG DROP OFFICE MANY PEOPLE HELD AGAINST HER WILL FOR THREE DAYS PARK IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO STABILIZE THEM IN WHICH TIME THEY CYCLE BACK OUT INTO THE STREETS. AND OFTENTIMES WILL COME THROUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE WANT TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP SOMEBODY FOR THE TWO WEEK COLD. TO THE ABILITY TO FOR THEM TO CARE FOR THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS- OFTENTIMES PEOPLE COME AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BLOOD SUGARS YOU KNOW OVER THREE HUNDRED OR- SEVERE ABSCESS ON YOUR SUPPORT. OTHER KIND CARE NEEDS MEDICAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS THAT THEY- ATTEND TO. BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. SO THIS WOULD SIMPLY SAY AGAIN WHEN I TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE- WHO IS BEING HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL. AT WE DO HOLD SOMEBODY AGAINST OTHER. STABLE EFORE WE DISCHARGE THEM OUT WITH THE PLAN THAT THEY'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO FOLLOW. SO THAT'S ALL THIS DOES IS IT ADD ONE MORE DIMENSION TO THE CRITERIA. OF WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HOLD SOMEBODY FOR TWO WEEKS VERSES. AT SEVENTY TWO HOURS. WELL THIS YEAR- PEOPLE KNOW IS. ACT BOTH AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER I HAD AN AUNT WITH SEVERE PERSISTENT BI POLAR DISORDER. I'M I'VE TAKEN TO. DEALING WITH THAT. AT THE THEY SPENT TRYING TO GET THEIR MOM OFF THE STREET AND INTO TREATMENT- ONE TIME. IN A HOLD FOR THREE DAYS THEY BEGGED HER. TO KEEP HER FOR TWO WEEKS THAT WOULD STAY WITH. HER SHE WAS REPLACED. RATE THE- HAVE DIED. EVERY TIME I SEE MY COUSIN SHE SAID PLEASE PLEASE HOW WOULD YOU GIVE PEOPLE DIGNITY TO LET THEM LIVE HONEST LIKE THAT MEMBERS I OFFER TO ANY WITH YOU KIDS WE'RE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET RIGHT NOW I HAVE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE'S SOMEBODY CLEARLY HAVING HAVE A SO THE MIDDLE THIS. OF AT AN SHE SAYS TO ME MOMMY WOULD WE DO AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT HELPS PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT TURNS ARE BACK ON PEOPLE AND IS TOO CONCERNED ABOUT. MAKING SURE EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT IF ANY WAY THEY WANT. WE BELIEVE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE SOMETIMES OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. DON'T LET THEM MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY NEED. THIS IS SIMPLY A WAY TO BE ABLE TO STABILIZE PEOPLE. BEFORE THEY GO OUT ONTO THE STREETS- THIS IS- THAT WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD WITH THE- HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS. AND WITH ME TODAY I ALSO HAVE RENTAL HAGAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION- SO AGAIN WE HAD DISTRICTS BEFORE KOBE. IS GOING TO GET. HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA COME OUT WITH TOOLS.

THAT PREVENT HEARING OFFICER CONSIDERING ANY EVIDENCE WHEN THE PSYCHIATRIST WOULD POINT OUT TO THEM BUT THEY DO HAVE. THE HI. BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL THAT THE OPEN SORE ON THEIR LEG OR WHATEVER MIGHT BE.

CONFIRM HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE THE DOCTOR HAS TO ENSURE ALL ENROLLEES IN CHURCH HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CARE. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR HEALTH PLANS INSURERS TO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC AVAILABLE TO CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN- IS NOT ONLY CONCERNING WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING IN A NOTE. COST IMPLICATIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS NOTED BY THE TO BURKE ANALYSIS. THE LACK OF EVIDENCE HAT DOES NOT MANDATE WILL RESULT IN BETTER PATIENT OUTCOME. AS YOU KNOW WELL I MEMBERS STRIPED INCORPORATE EVIDENCE BASED CARE. DO NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BY THE STILL TAKING IT DITIONS OR AT. THEM ON HOW TO ASSESS AND DIAGNOSE THEIR PAY. I THIS TYPE OF PROBE. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY PRESUMABLY CROSSES THAT TO BUY. HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS IN THE POSITION OF DICTATING MEDICAL PRACTICE. RIGHT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE BURKE ANNETTE. AT A- TEENS. DAY AND I'M- BILL IS HOLDEN APPROACH SHIN BLACK. FOUND THAT THERE WAS A- AT ON THE- SITES THE ACTOR DE. GENERAL IN ADDITION EVIDENCE ON THE BACK OF YOUNG YOU CONSUL FOR CHILDREN POST PARTUM FIRST CHIPPER WHEN ONSEN THERE WAS A CLAIM AT THE SHOWING THAT PSYCHE IT CANCELS OUR- IMPROVE APPROACH TREATMENT OF MENTAL AND- AS MEASURED BY IN. IN THE RICH. OF MORE APPROPRIATE CARE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER SATISFACTION AND TIMELINESS OF SERVICES. LEAVING US WITH THE QUESTION GIVEN THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WE COLLECTIVELY FACE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC TOGETHER IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL MANDATES ON OUR SYSTEM. AND IS THIS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY TO PLACE THAT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY BRING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO PATIENTS WE ARE SEEKING TO PRIORITIZE. REGRETTABLY WE DID LEAVE THE EVIDENCE BASED ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IT IS AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU. NEXT THE WITNESS. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PRESSED AND YOUNG I AM FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY- TWO POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE TODAY THE OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT WE HAVE AT THIS BILL IS THE FACT THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREATION OF A TELEHEALTH PROGRAM OF THE PASSED ON TO EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES BY. WAY OF INCREASED PREMIUMS- NOW SOME OF YOU MAY SEEM THAT COVER CALIFORNIA RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH AN ESTIMATE THAT NEXT YEAR THEY FEEL PREMIUMS COULD RISE ANYWHERE FROM 4240% DUE TO THE UNEXPECTED ANUNANTICIPATED COVERT RELATED EXPENSES THIS YEAR SO WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL INCREASED NEXT YEAR COMBINED WITH- WHEN ADVERSITY LATE IN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T THINK. SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION I'M AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A MANDATE SUCH AS IN LAYER PREMIUM IN A TOP OF ALREADY INCREASING PREMIUMS AND SUCH A DIFFICULT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOING TO MAKE DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE THAT MUCH MORE DEPTH AND NOW- THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS IF PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH NETWORKS AS WELL AS MEDICAL GROUPS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE SPECIALISTS AT THIS TIME- SO THE BILL WELL IT IS CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED ONE THAT CERTAINLY IS A PERSONAL IN MANY REGARDS TO ME IT IS NOT NECESSARY TIMES WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- IN ORDER TRACK MARKET TRENDS ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND POSTURING AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTEEN REQUIRES HEALTH INSURERS TO SUBMIT AGGREGATOR REPORTING FOR PLANS OFFERED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. NOW MORE THAN EVER REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS NEED A COMPLETE PICTURE OF OUR STATE'S HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE TO SHED LIGH ON HOW CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASE HEALTH COVERAGE EITHER. ON TOP OF CALIFORNIA OR OFF EXCHANGE ON THE OPEN MARKET. GOING TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA PREMIUM INCREASES IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND A POINT IF MARKETS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

AB TWENTY ONE AGING IS NEW TO GAUGE HOW CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURANCE PURCHASERS AND INDIVIDUALS SMALL GROUP MARKETS RESPONDING TO THESE NEW CHANGES IN PREMIUM NOT SOMETHING I WOULD GET. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION. I'M OFFERING AMENDMENTS TO DELAY NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. AND ADDRESS INCONSISTENT DEFINITION TO WEIGHTED AVERAGE PREMIUM. OVER NINETEEN EXPECTED TO AFFECT HEALTH INSURANCE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE NEED ASSURANCE. THEY'RE GETTING VALUE FOR THEIR PREMIUMS.

SO THAT WE CAN GET A GOOD PICTURE OF RATE INCREASES IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACING BOTH AND COVERED CALIFORNIA AND TO THE OUTSIDE MARKET OFF EXCHANGE. IN LIGHT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN MARCH AS MISTER KALRA ALREADY STATED COVER CALIFORNIA RELEASED A REPORT PREDICTING A HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS COULD RISE AS MUCH AS- EMPLOYER MARKETS. YOU NEED TO KNOW IF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR COMMUNITY. YOUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING RATE INCREASES THAT HIGH OR THEY'LL GET MORE MODERATE INCREASES AS WE ALL HOPE. YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE HEALTH PLANS TODAY THAT BECAUSE OF CLUB IN NINETEEN THIS ADDITIONAL REPORTING WILL BE BURDENSOME TO THEM. WITH MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR. FOR THEIR JOB BASED HEALTH COVERAGE. WE BE TRIED HOW THIS IS IN GRAY AND YOU'RE YEARS. WE OFFERED ME A MAN IN ANALYSIS. IN RESPONSE TO THOSE CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM.

WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I NOTICE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GENERAL WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JEFF HAND HOW CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS RIDLEY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY UNLESS AS AMENDED. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL FOR TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS RELATED TO THE BILL. I WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TO LINK THE NEW ROARED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT IN THIS BILL. TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE ARE STILL CONCERNED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL STILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTORS AND CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO INTO THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND MANY OF THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED WERE IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. WHICH MAKING JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IMPLEMENTATION DATE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING. PACIFIC LATE IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT HEALTH PLAN RATE FILINGS ARE DONE PROST ACTIVELY. PLANTS ARE PREPARING TO SUBMIT THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATES IN THE NEXT MONTH. AND IT HAD TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. ESTIMATE THE IMPACT THAT THIS PANDEMIC WILL HAVE ON FUTURE RATES. ADDING TO THIS COMPLEXITY PLANTS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY COVER CALIFORNIA pTO SUBMIT TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF RATES FOR THIS YEAR'S RATE FILING TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE PLANT WILL BE SUBMITTING THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATES. WITH THE CURRENT SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD STILL ON. WHICH WILL UNDER. COME THE RATE DEVELOPMENT. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS PLANS START TO START THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO RATES THIS FALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE FULL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY REALIZED. CONSIDERING THIS WE BELIEVE THAT DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS BILL UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WILL ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS THE TIME NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND FURTHERMORE WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO OBTAIN AND ANALYZE MORE TYPICAL DATA SUBMISSIONS FOR A DEVELOPMENT. LASTLY WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED AS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL UNNECESSARILY MODELS PER INDUSTRY STANDARDS. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AUTHORS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PREMIUM DEFINITION INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. THE DEFINITION IS STILL IN CONSISTENT TO THE CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICE. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT. FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL TO BE CONSISTENT AND STANDARDIZED INSURING A BROADER UNDERSTANDING AMONG HEALTH PLANS STAKEHOLDERS AND REGULATORS. I WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFTEN THE SPONSORS IS JUST AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SEVENTY WALKING FROM BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES- WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THAT- TERMINOLOGY USED IT'S CONSISTENT WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR THEY HAVE HAD AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH US THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. WE THINK GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PANDEMIC AND ALL THE DIFFICULTY THAT ALL OF OUR MEMBERS SHARE ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS ACCURATE AND THOUGHTFUL WE THINK IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO WITH TO DELAY THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE BILL IN ITS ENTIRETY TO. TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS WELL TO WORK TOGETHER ALONG WITH THE REGULATORS TO ENSURE THAT THE TERMINOLOGY THAT'S USED IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THEIR INTERPRETATION AND THAT ALL THE IN POINT POINTS ARE. BROUGHT UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR THE BILL. FOR TAX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MODERATOR YOU MAY OPEN THE LINES FOR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION FOR JUST THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. IF YOU IF YOU WISH TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO HAVE ONE THAT JUST CUTE UP PLEASE ALLOW MOMENT TRUSTEE OF OUR LINE NUMBER. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN. THIRTY EIGHT- WITH RESPECT TO A PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT OF PROGRAMS- THIS IS- VERY MUCH OF IT I TRANSPARENCY. EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITH RECEIVING FEDERAL PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE UTILIZED FOR THOSE DIRECT PURPOSES WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES UNFORTUNATELY IS SUCH THAT THERE ARE ENTITIES- TO WHICH THEY ARE UTILIZING FAIRLY IN PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS DIRECTED TOWARDS. HEALTH CARE SERVICES INTENDED FOR THE SERVICES UTILIZED IN POLITICAL FASHIONS AND NOT DOING SO IN A TRANSPARENT WAY- SIMILARLY THERE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. THIS IS PART OF THE NOTION TO WHICH OFTENTIMES MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO HAVE FRANK CONVERSATIONS AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE- THE BILL IS CO AUTHORED BY. FORMER LGBT CAUCUS CHAIR'S WIENER EIGHTEEN AND MYSELF- BECAUSE THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT ARE AGAIN USING PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS INTENDED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR DOING POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND MEMBERS WHAT TYPE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AM I REFERRING TO. THERE'VE BEEN NOTED POLITICAL ADS REFERENCING SPECIFICALLY MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE FOCUSED ON REMOVING NECK ROSE IN A PARTICULAR CITY REFERENCED AS THE URBAN RENEWAL MEANS NECRO. REMOVAL NOW WHAT ASSOCIATED NOTION OF FEDERALLY TAX KELLY GIVEN PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS INTENDED WITH MEDICARE UTILIZED IN POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT. ON A NON ASSOCIATED IMPACT- THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CODE CRISIS ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS FUNDED DIRECTLY TOWARDS HEALTHCARE. TO THAT INTENDED SERVICE SO AGAIN MA'AM THIS IS A TREND MAY. TO ENSURE THAT WE ABIDE BY THE SAME TYPE OF REGULATIONS IN PLACE AND IF IT ENTITY. SO DESIRES TO UTILIZE THEIR FREE SPEECH TO ATTACK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

THANK YOU MISTER LOWE WE HAVE WITNESS WE HAVE A WITNESS IN THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM I BELIEVE. AS PART OF THIS BILL IN SUPPORT. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THIS IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT FIFTY THOUSAND OWNERS AND MANAGERS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A STATEWIDE HOUSING SHORTAGE OF NEARLY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS ADEQUATE HOUSING AND HEALTH CARE OR TWO VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN OUR SOCIETY. THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS STRETCHED THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO ITS LIMITS MAKING IT EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE DOLLARS IN THE STATE TO BE SPENT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE ON HEALTH CARE. THESE DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO PATIENTS NOT SPENT. TO INFLUENCE OR FIND LOCAL STATE BALLOT MEASURES WERE UNRELATED LITIGATION. THAT EXACERBATES THE STATE'S CONTINUING HEALTH CRISIS AND HOUSING CRISIS UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED CASES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WHERE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT. EFFORTS TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA MAKING A BAD PROBLEM WORSE. IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT INSURES THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES ARE SPENT FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MOST- DIFFICULT AND ABUSIVE SITUATIONS. ANY ENTITY THAT USES DOLLARS FROM PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS TO STOP HOUSING PRODUCTION IS HARMFUL TO THE STATE ON GOING HOUSING CRISIS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A WITNESS ON THE PHONE MR STABLE HOUSE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PATRICK TABLE HOUSE I DON'T EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL PORTABLE HOUSING WHICH IS MADE UP OF. FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS LENDERS- HOUSING TAX CREDIT INVESTMENT FIRMS ON SITE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAVE EMPHASIZED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A NECESSITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE- THE EXTENT POSSIBLE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS AND OTHER FAMILIES WITHOUT ALSO PROVIDING. SUCH HOUSEHOLDS WITH A BASIC HEALTHCARE TO DO LESS THAN IT IS TO RISK THAT WE FEEL SHORT OF KEEPING MANY CALIFORNIANS IN DECENT SHAPE AN ADEQUATE SHELTER. AB NINE THIRTY EIGHT WOULD ASSURE THAT SUCH HEALTHCARE RESOURCES ARE UTILIZED PERSISTING SENIOR CITIZENS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO THE BASIC HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL SYSTEM SO THEY NEED. TO REMAIN HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PORTABLE UNITS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND UNITS WERE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS ON. SOCIAL SECURITY- INCOME ALONG THE SENIORS AND MANY OTHERS IN URBAN COMMUNITIES RELY ON ON THE SALABLE THEIR SERVICES- DISCOUNTED DRUGS THE- FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS REGRETTABLY SOME HEALTHCARE. DOLLARS IN SOME INSTANCES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED IN SOME MANNER OR ANOTHER TO PROPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT REPORTABLE HOUSING. GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY CORPORATE NINETEEN CHECK OUT REGIS AND MISUSE OF HEALTHCARE PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED PERMITTED. HEALTHCARE PLAN SHOULD BE EXPENDED ON HEALTHCARE NEEDS AS INTENDED AND NOT ON MATTERS WOULD OBSTRUCT AND DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT SHOULD INCLUDE HEALTH SERVICES. WERE POSSIBLE THE CALIFORNIA CAL SUPER PORTABLE. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IP ON BE NOT THIR EIGHT. REMOVE ONE MORE POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO OUR MEMBERS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE MORE FOR HOUSING TO CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR CONSIDER OUR VIEWS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A WITNESS IN THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM IN OPPOSITION BUT I'M SORRY. SHE'S BUY GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF HANG ON OTHERS IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE MISTER MODERATOR YOU MAY OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JUST THEIR NAME AND POSITION OF AN ORGANIZATION ONLY.

THANK YOU ORDER LINE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR TWO TWO FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI NUMBER FORTY DOLLARS WITH CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN ORDER EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU LINE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO TWO ZERO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. HE ONE MOMENT PLEASE. OKAY WE'LL GO ONTO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX TWO TWO SIX OUR LINE IS OPEN. YES SOME OF PARENTS OF KIDS IN THE GROUP. TO SCHOOL DISTRICT IN I. DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS. OKAY THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE MCCUE AT THIS TIME OKAY NOW WE WILL GO TO THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM- FOR A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RANDY MARTIN YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION- THIS IS A TALE OF TWO BILLS I'M THE FIRST ONE IF YOU LIVE READ THE BLACK AND WHITE OF THE- OF THE BILL YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS A DIRECT ATTACK ON AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION- WHICH- AIMS TO. GET ITSELF INVOLVED IN RENT CONTROL ISSUES BY SPONSORING PROP TEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THEY ARE ALL OF OUR OPPONENTS THE PEOPLE THAT PUT UP EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY AND KEEP CURRENT LAW RELATIVE TO RENT CONTROL COMPLEX. ON THE BILL. INDICATES IN ITS FINDINGS THAT THERE ARE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE- THAT THE AUTHOR HAS RELATIVE TO HF VIOLATING SOME LAWS RELATIVE TO THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG PRICING PROGRAM- WE HAVE ASKED REPEATEDLY FOR THAT VIDENCE- AND IT IS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY DIRECTED PEOPLE TO ON THE FEDERAL PERSONAL WEBSITE AS WELL AS TO MEDI CAL WHICH WE'VE BEEN AUDITED ON THESE PROGRAMS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN FOUND ON TOUR ABOUT ANY. OF THE MONIES THAT REVIEWS SO WE AGREE ACTUALLY WITH THE PREMISE OF THE BILL THAT NOBODY WHO'S GETTING PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD USE THOSE PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADVOCATING A BALLOT MEASURE. AND WE DON'T DO THAT- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS BILL FROM IF YOUR POLICY STANDPOINT. IT'S A BAD IDEA TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC FUNDS TO BE USED IT IS AN APPROPRIATE HOWEVER TO SINGLE OUT A SINGLE ORGANIZATION AND SAY THAT THEY CANNOT DO THIS. IF A BILL WHAT IF THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO LOOK AT- AT OTHER THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE USED PUBLIC FUNDS TO FUND BALLOT MEASURES AND I'M TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPERS AND- A PROPERTY OWNERS AND LANDLORDS ETCETERA. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE PROHIBITED BEING ABLE TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES IF THAT WAS THE BILL WE WERE PROBABLY END UP SO. IT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IT IS NOT A GOOD PUBLIC FATHER POLICY. TO PUNISH A SINGLE ORGANIZATION AGAIN FOR STEPPING OUT. IN FRONT ON THIS ISSUE. I'M I WOULD ADD JUST AT THE- TWO TO CLOSE WITH- THAT PART OF THE OTHER- POLICY QUESTION IS WHETHER IT IS EVEN APPROPRIATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO BE CONSIDERING A BILL. THAT SETS STANDARDS FOR A FEDERAL PROGRAM. THREE FORTY B. IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. I'M THERE THE STATE HAS NO AUTHORITY ON TO STEP UP. IN IN- INVESTIGATE OR SET NOT RAMBLERS AROUND HOW THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT- SO IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE- UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT. AN APPROPRIATE PROGRAM IT'S ALSO NOT PUBLIC FUNDS IN A THREE FORTY BPP PROGRAM MOST PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE. THAT IT IS NOT PUBLIC FUNDS IT IS NOT MEDI CAL FUNDS IS NOT MEDICARE IT'S NOT FEDERAL FUNDS IT IS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE THREE FORTY PRO. WE DON'T. ANY WE STRONGLY EMERGING TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE- MISTER MODERATOR YOU MAY OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU WISH TO WITNESS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE MINUTE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE NOT AT THIS TIME. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MAYES. IT'S JUST A QUESTION- I'M TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK- THE POLICY IS RIGHT BUT JUST WANTED TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION MAYBE FROM THE AUTHOR IN REGARDS TO. THIS AT LEAST FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THIS SEEMING TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED TOWARDS ONE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION BECAUSE AS A WHOLE I DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO COVER. ANYBODY THAT WOULD- WOULD WOULD I USE THE TERM BUT ABUSE OF THE SYSTEM OR IS IT ONLY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED TOWARDS OF ONE. ORGANIZATION THE VERY MUCH OF A THROUGH THE CHAIR OF VERY MUCH SPECIFICALLY- OUTLINING AS NOTED IN THE CAMINO SAYS SOME KEY PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES TO WHICH TO FOLLOW WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE FRAGRANT ABUSES. OF THIS MAGNITUDE OTHER THAN ONE ORGANISER IT'S HEALTHCARE SO WE'VE OUTLINED SPECIFIC CRITERIA OUTLINED AND IT ONLY APPEARS THAT THIS ONE ENTITY. IT IS USING THESE TYPE OF ABUSES AND AGAIN IT IS TO SAY SUCH THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM DIRECTLY- FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE SERVICES SHOULD BE USED AS SUCH AND THE ENTITY STILL WISHES TO ENGAGE IN THEIR FREE SPEECH. YOU'RE FREE TO DO SO BUT NOT IN THE SPECIFIC RESTRICTED FUNDS. SO WOULD IT APPLY TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OR OR WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THIS ONE ORGANIZATION. MY UNDERSTAND THAT NO OTHER ENTITY IS ENGAGING IN THIS OTHER TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT- WITH RESPECT TO THE DOLLARS IN THE TRANSPARENCY THAT WERE FOCUSED ON TO WRITE AS OF NOW WE ARE ONLY AWARE OF. AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AS THE ONLY OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE SEEN- REGISTER NOW BUT IF THERE WAS IT WOULD APPLY TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL NOT JUST TO THE ONE ORGANIZATION SURE WE I MEAN USUALLY OPEN TO THEY CALCULATE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD THAT IS THAT OF THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. SO WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT IT'S AS EXPANSIVE AS POSSIBLE NOT JUST TALKING. ONE ENTITY OKAY THANK YOU. ANYONE ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MR IS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I CREATED A MAKE SHIFT. COVER SO THAT I COULD SPEAK INTO THIS AND NOT OVER MY MASK- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I SPOKE TO OUR DEAR COLLEAGUE WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR EARLIER THIS MORNING AND I TOLD HIM HOW DIFFICULT OF A TIME I'M HAVING BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND IT'S A WONDERFUL TRANSPARENCY BILL WHICH I DO APPRECIATE I THINK WE ALL NEED TO- HOTEL ACCOUNT- EVERY ORGANIZATION THAT PARTNERS WITH WHETHER THE FEDERAL OR STATE OR LOCAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE DELINEATION OF THE FUNDS RECEIVED ARE USED FOR THE APPROPRIATE PURPOSES THAT WAS INTENDED FOR. AT THE SAME TIME- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ORGANIZATION HF THAT IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PLUS ANNUALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATION. HAS A PRIVATE FOUNDATION ARM. AND HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WORK OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THIRTY SEVEN YEARS- I'VE WORKED WITH THEM PERSONALLY AS A STAFFER AND AS AN ELECTED I'VE CARRIED MULTIPLE BILLS. WORKING WITH THEM. MOST RECENTLY THEY- SECURED A BUILDING IN MY DISTRICT. SEVENTY THREE UNIT BUILDING AT A COST OF. ALL IN SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. TO BE USED FOR HOMELESS SHELTER PURPOSES. AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF COMBAT HIV VIRUS WHEN. SOCIALLY A LOT OF FOLKS WITH DISTANCE THEMSELVES. FROM THE ISSUE SO IT PAINS ME GREATLY TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'VE PERSONALLY HAD A RELATIONSHIP IN A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS ORGANIZATION THAT HAS AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER OVER THE YEARS AND BE ATTHE FOREFRONT AT A TIME WHEN NO ONE WAS. AT THAT PLACE AND SO- I A- WOULDN'T WANT TO SEND A STINKING MESSAGE TO THEM THAT'S WHY I WILL REFRAIN FROM VOTING- BUT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANY ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISH TO ASK A QUESTION A COMMON. CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO MISTER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND- COLLEAGUES- AGAIN VERY MUCH INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TO HOLD OURSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD IN WHICH WE SEE PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND ARE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS TO WHICH THERE IS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND SO WE STILL WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREAT WORK OF THE MANY HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS OF INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THAT AND SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND THE COLLABORATION AND FOCUSED ON PREVENTION. AND REALLY DATING THE IMPACT OF AIDS PARTICULARLY IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS WELL RECOGNIZED. BUT THIS IS A Y. MENTION THIS GIVES ME NO GREAT DESIRE TO SAY THAT WE WANT TO TARGET. A MEMBER ORGANIZATION OF OUR OWN COMMUNITY. BUT IT IS ALSO THE OBLIGATION AND DUTY THE ETHICAL STANDARDS TO WHICH WE HOLD OURSELVES TO ACCOUNT AND AGAIN WHAT IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS PUBLIC PROGRAM IS BEING UTILIZED AND POLITICAL ADS TO A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AS AN EXAMPLE TO SAY THAT A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO REMOVE BLACK PEOPLE. FROM THE COMMUNITY. SPECIFICALLY USING RESOURCES FROM A PUBLIC PROGRAM IN A POLITICAL AD STATING. THIS MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO REMOVE NEGRA. BLACK PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY. SIMILARLY THAT SAME ORGANIZATION SPENT THE SAME DOLLARS TO ATTACK A MEMBER OF THIS BODY STATING THAT THIS MEMBER IS IN THE POCKET OF THE TAKE THE QUESTION THEN ESPECIALLY AND LIMITED RESOURCES IS THIS THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE REVENUES TO WHICH WE SHOULD HOLD THIS PROGRAM IN THIS ENTITY TO HIGHER STANDARDS IN WHICH YOU. RECEIVE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT'S WHAT THIS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. WE'RE NOT DISCOUNTING THE GREAT WORK IF YOU STILL WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS YOU CAN DO SO BUT NOT FROM THIS RESTRICTED FUNDS DO WE STILL WISH TO MOVE THIS BILL FORTUNATE PASSES COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ALL ENCOMPASSING. ABSOLUTELY WE WILL I WILL ABSOLUTELY COMMIT TO THAT BUT AGAIN LET US BE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IT IS SPECIFICALLY ON PARTICIPATION OF THIS LIMITED PROGRAM ON PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT. AND THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE PROGRAM SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IT SHOULD BE USED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DIRECT HEALTHCARE PURPOSES TO WHICH THAT OBLIGATION. AND THE RELATIONSHIP AND I CONTRACTED. WITH RESPECT TO MEDICARE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES SPECIFICALLY DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES. NOT EQUAL EDUCATION NOT ATTACKING. AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AND VERY DEROGATORY WAY- SO AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY BILL THIS IS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORED BY MEMBERS OF THE LGBT CAUCUS FORMER CHAIRS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND TRANSPARENCY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LOW. DO I HEAR A MOTION.

WHICH WOULD CAP COPAYS FOR INSULIN AT FIFTY DOLLARS PER THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF INSULIN AND NO MORE THAN A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A CALENDAR MONTH THE COST OF INSULIN FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS MY BILL AIMS TO HELP THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED INSULIN TO SURVIVE. ACCORDING TO THE ANNOUNCES BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS YOU PROGRAM LOW KNOWN AS CHIPPER. MY BILL WOULD HELP THIS BILL WOULD HELP ONE OUT OF THREE CALIFORNIANS USING INSULIN. AND WOULD SAVE THEM AN AVERAGE OF 51% IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS PER YEAR.

THANK YOU- I GET THE HINT OF. BETTER IT HEARINGS TO INSULIN REGIMENS IS CRITICAL ESPECIALLY NOW AMID THE COVERT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE WITH DIABETES A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE DEATH RATE FROM COVERT NINETEEN IS FOUR TIMES GREATER FOR THOSE WITH DIABETES IN A RECENT ARTICLE BY THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE. STATES RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES REMAINS IMPERATIVE IF INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR CONDITION THE RISK OF GETTING SEVERELY SICK FROM QUOTED NINETEEN IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE GENERAL POPULATION. SO NOW MORE THAN EVER PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES NEED OUR HELP TO LOWER THEIR KOBE SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THIS LIVING THIS LIFESAVING DRUGS. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WILL TELL YOU THAT MY ILL- WILL HELP MAKE INSULIN AFFORDABLE. THAT MIGHT HAVE BILL TO HELP MAKE INSULIN AFFORDABLE WILL MAKE INSURANCE PREMIUM SKYROCKET BUT THE CHIPPER ANALYSIS ESTIMATES THAT TOTAL PREMIUMS FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS PURCHASING GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD INCREASE BY ONLY POINT- 002% IN FACT THE JOB ANALYSIS FOUND THE BILL WILL HAVE ZERO IMPACT ON CALPERS BECAUSE HMO PRODUCTS OFFERED BY CALPERS ALREADY HAVE COPAYS AT FIFTY DOLLARS OR LESS- WITH US ON THE PHONE IS DOCTOR FRANCISCO PIETRO WITH THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION WIFE- HAD THE HONOR OF BUT PARTNERING TO PRESENT THIS BILL- AND ALSO MICHELLE LIEU OF A- HEALTH TRUST.

AND AM THE VICE CHAIR OF THE ABA'S NATIONAL THAT BECAUSE WE COMMITTEE. THE EIGHTY EIGHT OF THE- COPAYS WHAT THE- THAT WAS A COOL IN CALL ALL A YEAR AGO AND IN FACT. EIGHT OTHER STATE WHO THIS BUDGET. INCLUDING ILLINOIS MAIN MACS NEW USED PROPERTY. WASHING AND WHAT VIRGINIA. IN TWO THE LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED IN THE THIRTY CAN WE'RE HOPING THAT CAL WILL BE THE TENTH WHO WHO THIS. L. A MEMBER TO JERRY MENTION MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE BY AFTER IN ONE IS CRITICAL. IT A RATIONING DOES OF WE SEEN ON. VERY FREQUENTLY PUT PEOPLE AT HIGHER RISK FOR ALL COMPLICATE. AND DEATH FROM HIGH SUGAR. VERY QUICK EVEN THE FOR NET BUT LIKE THIS ONE. DURING THIS. IF EVEN MORE CORE THAN EVER TO KEEP WITH DIABETES HEALTHY AND OUT OF THE ARTS OF. BECAUSE IF THEY CAN THE CREW. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT THE SAME OF GETTING THE DISEASE THEY ARE MUCH INCREASED OF HELP COMP. AND DEATH. AND EVERY THREE IN YOUR DIED KIND AND TECH OF THE IN STAY OR ELEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS. BROWN A GREATER THAN FOR. GREATER RISK OF DEATH. DIABETES AND IT WAS THE MOST PROMINENT COMORBIDITY FOUND- IN THOSE WHO AT THIS BAD OUTCOME. IN ADDITION THE KEEPING PEOPLE WITH DIABETES OUT OF RUMORED TO TWO ROOMS AND OUT OF HOSPITALS MEANS THAT WE MAINTAIN OUR HEALTHCARE CAPACITY AND KEEP OUR PROVIDERS ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON TREATING THE PATIENTS COPE WITH NINETEEN. RATIONING AND SKIPPING DOSES OF INSULIN IS A GROWING PROBLEM ON PEOPLE WITH DIABETES THE EIGHTY EIGHT FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR INSULIN USERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE IMPACTED BY THE COST WITH MEDICATION. 32% REPORTED HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR INSULIN THE UTILITIES- ABOUT UP FOR THAT THEY- LEFT INFORMED AND WAS PRESCRIBED. OR MS JONES IS WEEKLY BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO AFFORD THIS. I CALIFORNIA WITH THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DIABETES HAVE TO ACT PROVIDES SOME REALLY AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE- BALL TO. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY OUR NEXT WHICH WITNESS MACHEL LOOP. ALSO ON THE PHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHELLE LEE WHEN I'M THE CEO IF THE HEALTH TRACK. THE HEALTH TRUST IS A NONPROFIT OPERATING FOUNDATION FOCUSED ON BUILDING HEALTH EQUITY IN SILICON VALLEY WE PROVIDE DIABETES SELF MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN ADDITION TO AN ARRAY OF OTHER SERVICES. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN THIS AREA AND FOR CARRYING AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE AND ARE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. WHICH WILL MAKE INSULIN MORE AFFORDABLE FOR NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES AND CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE PROVIDES A REASONABLE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING THE SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DIABETES. AND WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS BY CAPPING OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR COPAYS. IN OUR COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA WE SEE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF DIABETES ON SPECIFIC POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE DIABETES RATES FOR LATINOS ARE TWICE THE RATE OF NON LATINO WHITE. DIABETES IS ALSO A THREAT TO THOSE INNER AGING COMMUNITY WITH 25% OF THOSE OVER SIXTY DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. AND DIABETES IS THE SIXTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. NEARLY 26% OF DIABETICS WHO ARE PRESCRIBED INSULIN REPORTED COST RELATED UNDER USE. LEADING TO POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND POTENTIAL HEALTH COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE HEART DISEASE STROKE AMPUTATION END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE BLINDNESS AND EVEN DEATH. THESE COMPLICATIONS OFTEN LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. INSULIN RATIONING IS COMMON FOR LOWER INCOME PATIENTS WHO ARE OFTEN FACED WITH THE DECISION TO PURCHASE LIFESAVING MEDICATION OR TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES PAY THE RENT OR PAY THE UTILITIES BILL. AS YOU'VE HEARD COPING NINETEEN HAS EXACERBATED ARE CONCERNED FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AS THEY ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM COPE IN NINETEEN. FURTHERMORE AS AN EMPLOYMENT STORES MANY HELPFUL- LOSING JOBS AND ALSO HEALTH INSURANCE WE FEAR MORE PEOPLE MAY RESORT TO INSULIN RATIONING DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIME. DOZENS OF OTHER STATES HAVE INTRODUCED- PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION WE KNOW THAT IN COLORADO THE FIRST STATE TO PASS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR LEGISLATION THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PRICE INCREASE IN PREMIUM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE WITNESS VIEWING ROOM. MR WINDOWS AND I BELIEVE ALSO- WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND ALSO PRESTIN YOUNG CAL CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LOUISA'S WITH A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO ZERO THREE. MEMBERS CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY INSTITUTED BY LAW A DRUG COPAY CAP THAT APPLIES TO ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. NEW LAWS A CREATE DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DRUGS ARE BAD PUBLIC POLICY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE DAY INCREASE CONSUMER PREMIUMS ARE PARTICULARLY AT A BAD TIME- IT IN THIS CASE THIS BILL INCREASE THE PREMIUMS IN THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET BY OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE DIRECTLY INTERFERE WITH HEALTH PLAN BENEFIT DESIGNS IN A WAY THAT COULD LEAD TO OUT OF POCKET INCREASES FOR OTHER SERVICES. THREE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT OR LIMITED RESEARCH AT BEST TO SUPPORT CLAIMS THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD RESULT IN MORE IT HERE IT'S TAKING INSULIN OR THAT THEY WOULD BE BETTER OUTCOMES AND BE INDEPENDENT SUBURBAN ALICE'S- GOES INTO DETAIL ON THIS- AND LASTLY THE DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PRICE THAT DRUG COMPANIES CHARGE FOR THEIR DRUGS. ON INDEED THEY COULD MAKE THAT PROBLEM HARDER TO CONTROL. AND BUT WE DO WHAT ONE WOULD KNOWLEDGE THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LEAST INTENDED TO ADDRESS ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT BUT WE BACKGROUND HEALTH PLANS TO PAY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE DRUGS. ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S GROUNDBREAKING TRANSPARENCY LAW SB SEVENTEEN OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. HEALTH PLANS PAY 92% OF THE COST OF THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY DRUGS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. ON BY LAW BENEFIT DESIGN PREMIUMS CANNOT CHANGE MID POLICY YEAR THE US OF A PERSON'S OUT OF POCKET COSTS CHANGES IT IS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING PRICE CHARGED BY THE MANUFACTURER HAS GONE UP. ON IN ON THIS FRONT WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME DISTURBING TRENDS SOME OF THOSE ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR ANALYSIS SO- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL GO OVER ALL OF THOSE. BUT ON THE INULIN FRONT IN PARTICULAR PRICES HAVE NOT SLOWED ON DESPITE PUBLIC OUTCRY. RICE BIKES IN THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR INSULIN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF PREMIUMS. REGRETTABLY THIS BILL IS INTRODUCED DOES NOTHING TO TEMPER THE RAPID DRUG INCREASES IMPLEMENTED- BY- SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DRUGS. NOW WE DO STRONGLY BELIEVE IT AND IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THAT INSULIN IS A CRUCIAL TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS. AND HEALTH PLAN CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE. WITH THOSE A REPLY PROMISE AND IMPORTANT TREATMENT OF MANY OF OUR PLANS HAVE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO HELP IN RELEASE DO WHAT THE COST AND WE HAVE ALSO SUPPORTED COMMONSENSE PUBLIC POLICY APPROACHES- SB SEVENTEEN FOR INSTANCE ARE WE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER IS. IS PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY. BUT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE OF THIS LAW ALL MANUFACTURERS OF FALL INTO THE LONG NEED TO PARTICIPATE SO- BILLS THAT INTERFERE WITH THE MARKETING INSTITUTE STRICT PRICE CONTROLS IS THIS BILL DOES WHAT UNDER FIRE. UNDERMINE OUR EFFORTS MANAGE POTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS HERE IS TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE- THE BILL CERTAINLY ADDRESSES A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM BUT IN UNFORTUNATELY CREATES ANOTHER SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT IS THE FACT THAT INSULIN CAPS LAID OUT IN TWENTY TWO OR THREE WILL INCREASE PREMIUMS FOR- EMPLOYERS. IN RELATION TO THE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS KNOWS MISTER LOUISE US ALLUDED TO THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET WILL EXPERIENCE PREMIUM INCREASES IN APPROXIMATELY- TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF VALUE THE TRIP URBAN ALICE'S INDICATED THAT THE EMPLOYER PREMIUMS WILL INCREASE AROUND APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER IN THE PREVIOUS BILL COVER CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE PREMIUMS WILL INCREASE ANYWHERE UNEXPECTED COVERT RELATED EXPENSES THAT WE- EXPERIENCED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. NOW IS THE TIME WHEN BUSINESSES ARE JUST TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT IN. THE TO BOURBON ALICE'S SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT SMALL EMPLOYERS WILL EXPERIENCE THESE PREMIUM INCREASES AT A RATE HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT SEGMENT. SO BETWEEN THE PANDEMIC ISSUES AND RISING PREMIUMS NOW IS AN INAPPROPRIATE INOPPORTUNE TIME TO VOLITIONAL A LATER MORE EXPENSES ON BUSINESSES THAT ARE. SIMPLY TRYING TO WEATHER THE STORM AND GET THROUGH THIS TIME- THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE REASON AMENDMENTS THAT CAME OUT LAST NIGHT AND I REVIEWED THIS MORNING. START ADDRESSING MORE PERVASIVE ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEM AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LACK OF COMPETITION IN THE INSULIN MARKET. AND SO WHILE THE MANDATE WILL SAVE MONEY FOR SOME ON THE FRONT AND IT'S GOING TO INCREASE EXPENSES FOR ALL INSURANCE ON THE BACK AND- IN IT UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT ADDRESS THE DEEPER MORE PERVASIVE ISSUE. THAT IS CAUSING THE INSTANT PRICES TO RISE. SO IT IS IT WITH THESE POINTS IN MIND THAT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS A ME TOO WHEN THE- WITNESS VIEWING ROOM. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SEVENTY WHAT COMES ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES NOT POSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER MODERATOR ANY BUDDY IN OPPOSITION AND THE PHONE LINES YOU MAY OPEN THE LINES. IF YOU WISH TO- SHOW YOUR OPPOSITION YOU MAY DO SO BY COMING UP WITH ONE ZERO COMMAND. WE WILL GO TO LINE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR TWO FOUR FOUR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN SICK I'M A PERSON WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES AND I OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU. MODEL LINE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR TWO THREE FOUR. YEAH BUT MEMBERS- MISTER MEMBERS JOHN LINGER ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER FLORA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT TO THE AUTHOR. THAT THIS BILL ONLY HAS TO DO WITH INSULIN AND DOES NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER DRUGS. THAT'S CORRECT THE ONLY OUR STUDENTS ON. YES THANK YOU. MR MAYES. WELL THEN I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP TO THAT- SO AS MISS LOUISA SAID HAD TALKED ABOUT HIS TESTIMONY AT THAT THERE'S ALREADY A CAP OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS ON ALL DRUGS SO WHY INSULIN WASH INSULIN ONLY BE CAP TWO HUNDRED AND IS THERE IT IS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT OTHER DRUGS AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO CAP- OR DO WE NEED IT AS A AS A COMMITTEE BE THINKING ABOUT THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY- BEING A BEING TOO HIGH SO WHY INSULIN. I WOULD LOVE TO ENUMERATE THE REASONS BY THE WAY AND MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND I IF THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS I'M HAPPY TO HAVE DOCTOR PEER TO ALSO- CHIME IN OR MISS LOU TO CHIME IN ON ANSWERING THIS ON A MORE TECHNICAL BASIS BUT JUST SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF POINTS OF A COUPLE OF POINTS AT LEAST A I'D BE VERY PROUD TO WORK WITH YOU NEXT YEAR ON DOING THIS ON MANY OTHER DRUGS SO IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT I'M I'M HAPPY I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY- WHEN I WORKED STARTED WORKING ON THIS BILL LAST ON THIS ISSUE VERY LAST YEAR WITH WITH EIGHTY A SPECIFICALLY ON THIS BILL. UP PART OF THE REASON WHY I WANTED TO DELVE INTO THIS WAS JUST BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING EXPENSE AND COST TO THE STATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT BETWEEN TWO CONDITIONS DIABETES AND OF HEART RELATED CORNER RELATED ISSUES HEART DISEASE- THOSE COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL ON THE STATE'S THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR HEALTH CARE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS ALL IN SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES OF HOW MUCH OF A DENT YOU CAN MAKE IN CUTTING COSTS FOR- EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS FOUR MILLION OF THEM BEING IMPACTED BY DIABETES. THIS WAS A GREAT START. AND LOOKING AT HOW TO CONTAIN THOSE COSTS AND BE ABLE TO MAKE PEOPLE HOLD ON TO THEIR DOLLARS AND TO USE IT FOR BETTER FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT POLLING DATA THAT SHOWS YOU THAT 26% OF THE RESPONDENTS. RESPONDENTS ARE MAKING A DECISION BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT TO YOU PAY FOR INSULIN OR PAY FOR THEIR UTILITIES OR FOR THEIR RENT. OR FOR CHILD CARE THEN IT GETS INTO MORE SEVERE AND PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO I I'M HAPPY TO ENUMERATE THE VARIOUS REASONS WHY I FELT. GOING FORWARD AT LEAST ADDRESSING THIS ONE ISSUE AND BY THE WAY LAST BUT NOT LEAST LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THIS DRUG. MAKE UP. NOTHING IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. JUST THE COST HAS GONE UP. SO UP IF MR PLO OR ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN MISTER CHAIR AT AT. YOUR DIRECTION. OUR WITNESSES IN. SUPPORT DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO ADD TO. MISTER IS THERE AND I THINK HE DID A REALLY NICE JOB OF PRESENTING THAT. YEAH THIS IS DOCTOR PRE UP FOR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. YEAH SORRY YEAH I A ALSO WOULD- ECHO WHAT MEMBERS VERY UPSET AND JUST ADD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. INSULIN WAS DISCOVERED BY DOCTORS TING AND BEST ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE AT THE TIME. THEY EXPLICITLY MADE THE DECISION TO GIVE THEIR DISCOVERY- CHARGING ONE DOLLAR FOR THE PATENT TO BECAUSE THEY FELT. THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION WHAT'S SO WITH CENTRAL TO THE WORLD NOW. OF COURSE TOOK PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS BUT THE LAST MAJOR CHANGE AGAIN IN ONE MANUFACTURER HAPPENED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY BECAME AVAILABLETO USE RECOMBINANT DNA TO MAKE A COPY. OF HUMAN INSULIN. AT WHICH IS WHAT WE USED TO. RATHER THE PREVIOUS. GROUND UP BEEF AND PORK PANCREAS EXTRACTS BASICALLY WE TOOK ANIMAL INSOLENCE AND INJECTED THEM INTO HUMANS UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES. THE MEDICATION NOT CHANGED IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND IS THERE ARE NO GOOD REASONS WHY IT. WHAT IT DOES. I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS ONLY PART OF ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR FOLLOW UP MR MAYES JUDGES DEFY IF I CAN MAYBE THAT THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS. A JUST- ANSWERING THAT QUESTION COMMITTEE GOING A LITTLE BIT MORE SO MY QUESTION IS SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO. IF CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW LIMITS. COST SHARING TWO TWO AND A FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEN THE QUESTION I THINK FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY. WHY WOULD WE SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT INSULIN AND NOT CAP CALL OUT OTHER DRUGS AS WELL OR SHOULD WE COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF FORMULA AIRY FOR THAT OR SHOULD WE TAKE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S THE CURRENT TO DROP TO DROP THAT. WE DO KNOW THE INSULIN IS A LIFE SAVING DRUG BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER LIFESAVING. DRUGS AS WELL AND I'M JUST WONDERING- AS AS FAR AS PUBLIC POLICY IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY THIS AND NOT OTHER. DRUGS SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE CALLED OUT. YOU MAY GO IN THEIR CHARACTER. YES THIS IS DOCTOR PRE UP AGAIN- I THINK INSULIN IS FAIRLY UNIQUE THERE MAY BE AN ARGUMENT FOR PUTTING OUT. SIMILAR CAP ON OTHER MEDICATIONS AS WELL BUT THIS IS A MEDICATION THAT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES. IT LITERALLY LIFE OR DEATH THIS WAS A UNIFORMLY FATAL DISEASE TYPE ONE DIABETES. IN SHORT ORDER AT BEFORE THE DISCOVERY OF INSTALLING- THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR OF THE- I'M A CO INCREASE IN PRICE AND- I THINK THAT. AB CALLS FOR THIS SORT OF ACTION IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY ACTUAL THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY ENDS UP TAKING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING AND I'M SURE WE BEAT YOU KNOW INTERESTED IN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTION THAT YOU CAN TAKE. ABOUT. THANK YOU ANY ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF MR LOUISA SO STILL IN TE WITNESS FUNERAL CUT LIKE TO ASK HIM A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF HE DOESN'T MIND. YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS PASSED IN COLOR WELL WAIT TO MISTER RESOURCES BACK SO. RIGHT WHAT IS YOUR CHAIR YES SO THIS BILL WAS PASSED IN COLORADO LAST YEAR AND ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY INCREASES IN PREMIUMS I BELIEVE MISTER IN THIS AREA AND THE COST WAS. WAS PRETTY SMALL OF ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. WE HAVE A POPULATION CALIFORNIA THAT BY MANY ESTIMATES AS 50% PRE DIABETIC. WE HAVE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ON DIABETES- EIGHT I GUESS FOR ME I JUST WONDER IF PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR MEDICATION BETTER WOULD IT NOT POTENTIALLY BE A PLUS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS WOUND CARE AMPUTATIONS- PROSTHETICS. TO REPLACE THAT THE AMPUTATED LIMBS- AND SO ON SO- I WILL ALSO NOTE AND AS AS AT THAT IN COLORADO. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS NOT ULTIMATELY NOT IN OPPOSITION THE BILL THEY WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL SO WHY WOULD CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS BE AGAINST A BILL THAT HAS A PROVEN TO INCREASE PREMIUMS IN ANOTHER STATE. AND IT'S NOT I JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I FIELD UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THAT QUESTION AND SO I'LL TRY TO TAKE THOSE SEQUENTIALLY- THERE ARE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN IN THAT- NUMBER ONE I DID I DID- YOU KNOW CHECKING IN WITH- OUR OUR NATIONAL TRADE- THAT TOOK A POSITION ON THE BILL- IN COLORADO ON AND I CONCERNS WITH THEM THAT- THEY ACTUALLY DID NOT REMOVE- THEIR OPPOSITION TO THAT BILL. IN THAT STATE NOW YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M NOT THERE WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT FELL ON THE PRIORITY LIST. BUT NEAR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE REMAINS TECHNICALLY OPPOSED AS OPPOSED TO THEIR NOT BEING A PREMIUM INCREASE. ALL ALL ALL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS. TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY- MY UNDERSTANDING THERE IS THAT- WHEN THE BILL PASSED WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE RATES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF ENACTMENT- HAD ALREADY BEEN FILED. SO THOSE PREMIUMS ARE YOU KNOW FIVE WERE ABLE TO BE ADJUSTED AND REFLECTIVE OF THE NEWLAW- YOU KNOW IN ITS INITIAL PHASE. SO MAYBE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME- THOSE- COST- YOU KNOW WHAT I WORK FOR AN OUNCE AT LEAST THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE TECHNICALITIES THERE IN COLORADO- I WILL SEE YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DRUG- AGAIN HEALTH PLAN BENEFIT DESIGNS- ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE- YOU KNOW THEIR- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A GENERIC OKAY WE HAVE A PREFERRED BRAND WE HAVE A BRAND AND THEN FOR SOME DRUGS THERE IS A CO INSURANCE- AGAIN- YOU KNOW OUR PREMIUMS ARE REVIEWED. I WILL SAY THAT- YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR PLANS AND I NATIONALLY HAVE- IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE ACTUALLY LOWER. ON THEN THIS BILL BUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT IS REALLY BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE RIVER THE MANUFACTURERS IF YOU LEGISLATIVE LEE INSTITUTE A PRICE CONTROL ON ONE SIDE OF THOSE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP- YOU CAN IMAGINE. WHAT THE INCENTIVE WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO YOU- YOU KNOW ESTABLISH THE RIGHT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP AND ARRANGEMENTS. ON THAT ALLOW FOR LOWER OUT OF POCKET COSTS SO- IN AND I WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE CHIPPER ANALYSIS WHICH IS ALSO REFLECTED IN IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH STATES THAT. YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE THE RESEARCH DOESN'T NECESSARILY POINT TO BETTER IT HERE ANSWER OUTCOMES. ON BASED ON ON COPAY. CAPS SO. I I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. THANK YOU. I GUESS ASKING OTHER QUESTIONS THAT. THAT THAT MAY BE THE CASE GEN WHAT USE WERE GENERICALLY WITH CO PAY CAPS BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT MEDICATION AND WE HEAR. ALL THE TIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME AFFORDING INSULIN. SO ONE THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU AS I I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S ANY GENERIC INSULIN. CORRECT YEAH- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL- AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS INCLUDING- YOU KNOW AT LEAST AT AT. ONE OF OUR HEALTH PLANS IS INVOLVED. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO- TRY TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC- SO YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE HOW FAR THEY GO THERE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY- THAT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE- DEVELOPED IT AS WELL. BUT I WILL SEE NEEDING YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO THIS IN YOUR COMMENT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I MEAN WE DO HAVE A TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE PROBLEM WITH. CARVING OUT A DIFFERENT COPAY CAP FOR SPECIFIC DRUGS. AND YOU KNOW I WON'T- YOU KNOW BORE YOU WITH ALL THE TECHNICALITIES BUT THEIR- ALL OF HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS- BETTER OFFER TO COVER CALIFORNIA HAVE TO ACHIEVE AN ACTUARIAL VALUE. SO THAT MEANS- IF YOU ALTER THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR ONE SERVICE- YOU MAY HAVE TO. YOU MAY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP THOSE. COSTS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER SERVICES AND- YOU KNOW OUR FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT THIS BILL TO BELIEVE THAT A SEPARATE COPAY CAP FOR INSULIN WILL. REDUCE THE FLEXIBILITY ON PLAN BENEFIT DESIGN- YOU KNOW HOW TO COVER CALIFORNIA WHICH COULD IN YOU KNOW. I THINK SOME MORE NOW SEEMS TO BE DONE ON THIS COULD. MEAN THAT YOU KNOW. OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER SERVICES MIGHT HAVE TO BE ALTERED TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH. HOW MUCHCALIFORNIA'S PAY AND HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS EACH YEAR ROUGHLY HOW MANY BILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE A DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT ROUGHLY. I MEAN IT'S IT IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS OF. YEAH THAT HUNDRED BILLION MAYBE MORE OR LESS LIKE YOU KNOW I I'D BE TAKING A WHILE YES I DO KNOW. THAT HEALTH PLANS PAID NEARLY BACK TEN BILLION DOLLARS JUST SOME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ALONE WHICH IS YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW PERCENTAGE OF THE- OF THE HEALTHCARE PREMIUM DOLLAR. SO IN THE HUNDRED PLUS BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS WERE TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AT WITH AN M. AND YOU'RE TALKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREMIUMS WITH A BE AND SO I THINK THE COST S PRETTY SMALL. I WOULD SAY ALSO THAT THERE IS A SUNSET WITH THIS AS WELL. SO IF. IT HEARINGS DOESN'T CHANGE- THIS THIS POTENTIALLY WILL BE REEVALUATED AND MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT TO GO AWAY. BUT I'D- BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW- FOR SURE. OTHER THAN WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THEIR INSULIN- RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR SURE HOW MUCH OF A POSITIVE IMPACT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AND MAYBE. SAVE THE INDUSTRY A LOT OF MONEY WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE YET BUT THAT'S WHY THERE'S A SUNSET ON THIS IT WILL GO BACK AND RE EVALUATE THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WHY IS ONE REASON I ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILLS I DO BELIEVE THIS. I AM DISTURBED BY WILL MAKE A COMMENT HERE WHICH I WILL ALSO MAKE AN BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT ON OF I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT- WITH WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ON INSULIN CALIFORNIA. POTENTIALLY 50% OF THE POPULATION BEING PRE DIABETIC THAT- IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE HE HAS ELIMINATED. THE FUNDING FOR THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. WHICH IS ALMOST WHICH IS LIKE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY. WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON DIABETES THE STATE LEVEL- I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM GO AWAY BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT YOUR THAT THAT'S NOT YOU THAT'S NOT YOUR ISSUE MUST PLEASE US. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HOPE IT WILL CONTINUE TO DEBATE FURTHER HERE SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS I APPRECIATE. YOUR INPUT. SIX ANYONE ELSE.

EVEN BEFORE THE CURRENT COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC SUICIDE RATES AMONG ALL GROUPS HAVE BEEN INCREASING DRASTICALLY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AFFECT PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE THE RISK OF SUICIDE IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT AMONG ADOLESCENTS OLDER ADULTS VETERANS. LGBT Q. NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH AND ADULTS SUICIDE RISK IS SIGNIFICANT IN NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH FACE HIGHER RATES OF SUICIDE THAN THEIR PEERS IN ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF SUICIDE WE CRIER OF FOCUS ON NATIVE AMERICAN YOU. THOSE WHO ARE AT GREATEST RISK. ARE AT EVEN GREATER RISK NOW THE UNPRECEDENTED COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS WILL HAVE EXPOSED SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES MENTAL HEALTH DUE TO ANXIETY CAUSED BY MANY FACTORS SUCH AS ISOLATION. GRIEF OVER THE LOSS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY. HEALTH CONCERNS INCREASE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE IN THE WAY OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM NOT ONLY DURING THE CRISIS BUT LONG AFTER. AB TWENTY ONE TWELVE TAKES THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THE CURRENT CRISIS OF SUICIDE BY CREATING A STATEWIDE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

THE COMMISSION IS PROUD TO JOIN THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IN SPONSORING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWELVE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. IN 200-018-4000 FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR LIVES TO SUICIDE. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MORE THAN A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MORE THAN A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE NUMBER OF LIVES LOST ISSUES THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE FURTHER AS A RESULT OF THE CALL THAT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. COORDINATED PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. THE STATE'S RECENTLY ADOPTED SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN WAS BUILT ON TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND IS BACKED BY THE LATEST IN SCIENCE OF SUICIDE AND ITS PREVENTION. THE STATE PLAN OUTLINES TWELVE GOALS TO ADVANCE EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE DEATH BY SUICIDE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THOSE GOALS BEGIN WITH THE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP TO CATALYZE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO SUICIDE. THAT WORK BEGINS WITH ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROB US FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO SAVING LIVES FROM SUICIDE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

OKAY WHETHER FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN NOW. HELLO MY NAME CARE WHETHER FOR I AM SEVENTY YEARS OLD I'LL BE EIGHTEEN EMPLOYMENT I AM EXCITED TO SAY THAT I WILL BE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH ONE DAY I AM ENROLLED IN THAT YOU'RE NOT RANCHERIA AND A GROUP YOU'RE OUT AND CHECK ON IT THAT. I AM THE RECIPIENT OF THE NORTH COAST FOR THE INDUSTRY HIGH CRIME RECORD WHICH RECOGNIZES STUDENT THAT OVERCOME HARDSHIPS AND COME OUT ON THE ON THE OTHER SIDE. MY GOAL IS TO ATTEND COLLEGE OF THE REDWOODS IN THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO BECOME A WRITER AND AUTHOR. BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES I'VE A TIME I BELIEVE WE ENSURE THAT ALL THE THAT WITH TRONG POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE I AM CONFIDENT THAT I AM STRONG TO CONQUER ANY NEGATIVE ENERGY OF OPTICAL. NOT A- BEEN THE CASE. THROUGHOUT LIFE I'VE EXPERIENCED MAY. MEDICAL EXPERIENCES THAT A YOUNG PART LIKE MY- SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. ONE OF THE MORE PROMINENT OBSTACLE I'VE HAD TO OVERCOME INCLUDING MY FATHER. JANUARY FOURTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN MY FATHER WAS DONE TO DEATH IN THE CHEST IN ORDER CALIFORNIA.% AFTER FINDING OUT ABOUT HIS MURDER I WAS FLOODED WITH FEELINGS OF ANGER SADNESS AND HOPELESSNESS. IN THE PILOT THERE ANY MY WIFE CROSSED MY MIND. IT WAS THE THOUGHT THAT THE NEVER ENDING I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WITHOUT MY MOM DID MANAGE YOUR FOSTER ARE GETTING YES THEY WILL HALL. ANY SYSTEM TO KEEP OTHERS NEAR THE MAC AMERICAN FAMILY SERVICES. I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE MADE IT. TWO BROTHERS AND MY MOTHER PROVIDED ME WITH THE UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT THOSE ESSENTIAL TO GETTING ME THROUGH THE DARKEST TIME OF MY LIFE. SINCE THEN RECONNECTING WITH MY CULTURE FROM MY DAD'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY HAS BEEN A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. THAT HAD STRENGTHENED MY TIED TO THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY GETTING HELP FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TEAM HAS ALSO BEEN BECAUSE OF MY ABILITY TO OVERCOME MANY OF MY DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT. I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF HAVING A STATEWIDE OFFICES TO THE COLLECTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT YOU AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

THANK YOU VISIT. AND THAT IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WOULD LIKE CLOSEST SORRY. THIS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I SEE A LOT OF GROUPS FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I ALSO DOES HAVE SOME CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO JUST THE ACCESSIBILITY. OVER GETTING FOLKS TO CONTINUE- WITH SOMETHING THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO THEIR LIVES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. REDUCING FUNDING THAT HELPS PEOPLE GET OFF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HELPS WITH THEIR DRUG ADDICTION SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE IT'S A- IS THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BOLD AND HAVE A LOT OF INITIATIVE BEHIND IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THE SAFETY NET FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THAT SUPPORT. IS ACTUALLY RECEIVING LESS FUNDING. AND SO I'M I'M JUST I'M AT A LOSS BECAUSE IN IN THE CITY OF LA IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH. LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTITUDE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS WOULD SYRINGES ON THE GROUND OFFICERS THAT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED INSTEAD BY INDIVIDUALS WITH SYRINGES. FEMALE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HAD TO HAVE HIV AIDS ANOTHER TEST TESTING DONE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ATTACKED BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE SYRINGES. AND I'M JUST NOT NECESSARY I DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AT THIS TIME. AND SOME JUST CURIOUS- TO THE AUTHOR LIKE WHAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE ON HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS. THE LACK OF SAFETY NET. OF LAWMAKING SYRINGES MORE ACCEPTABLE. QUESTION VERY REASONABLE QUESTION SO REGARDING THE STATE THAT I THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU DO WE ARE I PRESIDENT TIME REGARD OUR BY THIS NOT THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE TO. HAVING WE ARE CAN ABOUT THE BUDGETARY. ON PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL A HUMAN SERVICES HAVING SAID THAT THAT IS NOW WITH BILL IS IF YOU GO WITH THE FIRST. THAT SOMEHOW GRAY ACCESS TO SURRENDER SOMEHOW. INCREASE RIGHT YOU INCREASE CRIED THERE'S REALLY NO STAR THAT. FIFTY WORKS. SO IF YOU ACTION. ACCESS TO SURRENDER. WHAT YOU HAVE IS. THE DRUG YOU. PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DO THAT THEY WOULD JUST DO SO THIRTY SO. OR WORSE COMES WORST THING SHARESTHE RICHNESS SO THAT IS HOW LIKE HIV WAR. THAT IS DISEASE LIKE THAT'S HOW THESE. SO AGAIN YOU TALK TO EVERY SO JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC HEALTH BUT DOWN THE STATE. THEY WILL TELL THAT THIS IS VERY MEDICALLY FOR FROM HEALTH POINT OF VIEW AB THE RIGHT THING TO. SINCE FOURTEEN WHEN I CARRIED MY. WE HAVE NOW CREATED THE MOST EXTENSIVE TAKE BACK PROGRAM WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND SYRINGES IS I THINK THERE'S REALLY TWO YOUR THREE SEPARATE THINGS MENTION IS WE NEED MAKE SURE THAT OUT OF TO SPOIL OF WHICH I COLLECT AGREE YOU MORE. THAT'S WHY WE SB TWO ONE IS THE COMPREHENSIVE WITH THE INDUSTRY SUPPORT AND WITH THE BOOK WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE. THERE WAS SOME TO UPON THE MANY TO NOT JUST AND SELL THE RIDGES OF BUT THEY'VE WERE OUT OF JUST OF ALSO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THT WE'RE GONNA FIGHTING FOR SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE SERVICE WITHIN BUDGET CONTACT. BUT IT. IF YOU DON'T THE BILL WHAT IT DOES IS IT WILL BE BE WITH DECREASE TO CLEAN SERVE. ENABLE ENCOURAGED TO SHOW THIRTY AND TRANSMIT. TO SO THAT'S WITH THE FOR THAT WERE WE'RE TRYING 2% WITH THE. SEEING GREATER SUCCESS WITH THE BILL BECAUSE AGAIN OF THE REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION OF THESE DISEASES AND THAT THAT'S THE POOL WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OTHER QUESTIONS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU- SO THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PHARMACIST TO ACTUALLY GIVE INFORMATION TO THE PERSON. DOESN'T IT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW SAFE DISPOSAL- DISEASE TRANSMISSION OR OTHER THINGS. SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULDN'T GET OTHERWISE I WAS JUST. YOU KNOW THE CONCERN THAT. I GUESS IT'S THE SECOND OF LEADING CAUSE OF HIV TRANSMISSION. THROUGH A NEEDLE SO JUST FIGURE ELABORATE ON THAT NOR WILL WE THEN THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE PHARMACIES EVEN SINCE WE LAST PRODUCED A BILL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HAVE ACTUALLY IS A TO TAKE BACK PROGRAMS AND SO WHILE THEY'RE SELLING SYRINGES THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH. CLIENTELE TO TAKE BACK THE SYRINGES SO IN MY CITY IT'S VERY COMMON THAT IF YOU BUY SYRINGES IN THE CITY COUNCIL FRANCISCO YOU GET A TAKE BACK DISPOSAL BUT GET THE UC AND MOST HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SO THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS COMMON IS THAT A LOT OF WERE DISPOSED OF SO THEY PUT IN THE TRASH. THEN IT'S NOT VERY DANGEROUS TO FOR ALL THE WASTE HAULERS BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE- VOICESTREAM THAT THIS GOES ON. YEAH I WE ARE THE WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT SYRINGES NOW AFTER TO WORKING ON THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS ALSO VERY FEW PLACES WERE SYRINGES GO TO BE DISPOSED OF ACTUALLY IN THIS COUNTRY SO YOU CAN'T WHERE WOULD IT WOULD HOSPITALS GET SYRINGES IN A TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE. THEY ACTUALLY DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DUMP LIKE WE DO THE BEST WAY STATE THE ONLY A FEW PLACES IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ACTUALLY GO TO BE INCINERATED SO EFFECTUALLY. A DIFFICULT TO VARIOUS OF. HOW THEY COULD DISPOSE OF SO. AGAIN REALLY REALLY DO A- THAT QUESTION. IT IS AN UP. FOR AGAIN. THE PHARMACY TO PROVIDE GREAT EDUCATE ABOUT VARIOUS RESOURCES. BOTH FOR HELP THIS IS MY CALLING FROM LA PRADA BUT ALSO. WE'RE TO DISPOSE OF THE ITEMS WHICH IS ALSO AN ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE.

PAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF BILL HERE AND I'M I'M REALLY REALLY THANK YOU MISTER MODERATOR YOU MADE OUR DAY A LOT A LOT BETTER- WITH YOUR FISH AND SEA AND PROFESSIONALISM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I. WANT TO. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY. FIRST I AM ACCEPTING MY AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN THE IMAGE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IMAGINE THAT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE PASSED AB EIGHTEEN TEN OF A BUDGET TRAILER FOR ASA PAD TO DEVELOPING COMPLETE A HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATABASE BY JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AB EIGHTEEN TEN ALSO REQUIRED I SPREAD TO ESTABLISH A REVIEW COMMITTEE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS UPON THE INPUT ON THE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DATABASE. THIS BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY WOULD ESTABLISH THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPLETION OF A HEALTH CARE- PAYMENTS DATABASE PROGRAM WITHIN OUR SPENT. IT ALSO INCORPORATES MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REVIEW COMMITTEE BUT NOT ALL TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF THE DATABASE WE EXPANDED ON SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WHILE BOUNCE IN THE NEED FOR DATA CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY OF INFORMATION. IS WHAT CALLING FROM HEALTH PLANS INSURERS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS ALL NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A MEANINGFUL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COST HEALTHCARE. SURE PLANTS ARE NOT TAKE THE STATE AUTHORITY WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO SUBMIT DATA. CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVACY ACCESS AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN INCLUDED TO GOVERN THE SUBMISSION ACCESS THE RELEASE OF ANY DATA. HEALTHCARE PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE. AND HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY SHOULD NOT JUST BE A GOAL OR AMBITION FOR POLICY MAKERS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR IS NOT MOVING FORWARD TO ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND HIS TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. ON THE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATABASE WILL BE ON THE FOUNDATION FOR THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. THE PROGRAM THIS BILL ESTABLISHES WILL BE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DATA SOURCE TO THE CALIFORNIA CAN BE A NEED TO MEASURE HEALTH CARE COSTS. ANALYSTS TOTAL SECTOR COST GROWTH RATES MONITOR PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY EVALUATE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS TRACT CHRONIC DISEASES IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HEALTH CARE THE BEANS AND UNNECESSARY SPENDING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. AB TWENTY THIRTY ESTABLISHES THE FOUNDATION FOR ACHIEVING THE TRIPLE AIM OF HEALTH CARE. IMPROVING HEALTH CARE REDUCING HEALTH CARE TO SPARE SIX DISPARITIES WHILE CONTROLLING COSTS. IS A COMPLEX BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS A COMMITTEE HOUSE. JOINING US IN SUPPORT RON COLEMAN WITH HELP HEALTH ACCESS AND JOAN ALLEN WITH AS YOU ARE YOU ARE HERE TO TESTIFY AND BETH CAPELL WITH HEALTH ACCESS IS ALSO ON THE LINE TO ASSIST WITH TECHNICAL. QUESTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD WILL MOVE- TO. THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT JUST AS A REMINDER THAT'S LIMITED TO SIX MINUTES. YOUR GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY HEALTH ACCESS ALONG WITH OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCESS SPARKED BY DOCTOR WOODS EFFORTS CAN HEALTH CALL. AND IMPROVING QUALITY WHILE ALSO REDUCING DISPARITIES ARE THE GOALS AND HEALTH CARE IT'S REFERRED TO AS THE TROUBLING BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME A HEALTH PAYMENTS DATABASE WILL ALLOW POLICY MAKERS AND RESEARCHERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S MAKING PROGRESS ON THE TROUBLING OF REDUCING COSTS IMPROVE QUALITY WHILE ALSO REDUCING PROP DISPARITIES IF WE HAD A HELP PAYMENTS DATABASE TODAY. YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH CARE WAS PROVIDED TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WAS PAID TO DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES FOR WHAT TYPES OF CARE. THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ON THE NEED FOR HELP PAYMENTS DATABASE BUT THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THE SPECIFICS AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY PROPOSES THAT WE COLLECT DATA DIRECTLY FROM DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS WHY THE US SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED THAT BETTER LAW PRE VINCE STATES FROM COLLECTING DATA FROM THE FIVE TO SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN SELF INSURED EMPLOYER PLANS AND ALSO LABOR TRUSTS. THAT AFFECTS GROWTH STORE WORKERS OR THE EMPLOYEES THAT GOOGLE OR ALSO THE EMPLOYEES AT BANK OF AMERICA. SO AB TWENTY THIRTY PROPOSES TO GET DATA DIRECTLY FROM HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS. THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TODAY. ADDRESS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CONCERNS FROM THE HOSPITALS AND THE THREE YEAR DELAY GIVES TIME TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT CMA HAS IDENTIFIED. YOU WILL HEAR CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY BUT WHERE REST ASSURED. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT BOTH CMI AA AND HIPPA AND THE DADDIES THE DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS BILL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ENOUGH TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND THEIR PRIVACY. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY EXPRESSLY STATES THAT NO DATA IS SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. IT CREATES A CRITERIA AND THE PROCESS FOR RELEASING THE DATA ONLY TO QUALIFIED APPLICANTS WHO CAN MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY OF THE- THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS IN THE HURDLES ARE GOING TO BE REAL. THE REVIEW COMMITTEE SPENT AN ENORMOUS TIME HASHING OUT THESE ISSUES IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WILL WORK AND THE LANGUAGE ON THESE PROVISIONS BEFORE YOU TODAY IS LARGELY THAT DEVELOPED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND- THE WORK. OF THE COMMITTEE. THE POINT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY IS TO KNOW WHAT DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE GETTING PAID BY HEALTH PLANS AND SELF INSURED PLANS. AND TO KNOW WHAT HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ELIMINATING REPORTING BY PROVIDING ELIMINATING REPORTING BY PROVIDERS WOULD MEAN THAT THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON THE CARE FOR THE FIVE TO SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS. IN THOSE PLANS ELIMINATING CONTRACTED RATES WOULD WE MEAN THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. HOW MUCH CARE ACTUALLY COST THIS INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL IN CALIFORNIA MEETING THE TRIPLE EIGHT ONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO. WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU PERFECT GREAT. WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE IN SUPPORT. HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M DAVE VS HERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA AND ARE SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY WHICH WILL FINALLY ESTABLISH AND OPERATIONALIZE THAT HEALTHCARE DATABASE- SCA YOU AND OTHER CONSUMER ORGANIZATION ALONG WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS HAVE WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AND WE ARE EXCITED THAT- THIS BILL WILL HELP TO ACTUALLY ENACT AND ESTABLISH THE DATABASE. WE ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON OUR MANY POLICY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DATABASE IS A SUCCESSFUL ONE I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO JOHN ALLEN FROM ONE OF OUR LOCAL THROUGH HAVE BEEN OUR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE OFF SPENT REVIEW COMMITTEE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE POLICIES IS THAT SPECIFICS. OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS JOAN ALLEN WITH US YEAH YOU YOU H. W. AS I MENTIONED THAT I SAY YOU CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN THE UP OFFERED REVIEW COMMITTEE. OF AND I JOIN STAKEHOLDERS WERE CROSS THE HEALTHCARE CONTINUING TO YOUR LONG PROCESS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXCITED TO SEE SO MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF WHICH WERE FORMED BY CONSENSUS THROUGH THAT YOUR LONG PROCESS THAT REALLY WAS- BROUGHT OUT THE BEST OF THE COLLABORATION OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- IT SEEMS UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATIONS REPRESENTED IN THIS BILL. AS REFLECTED IN THE INTENT LANGUAGE THE HPT WILL GIVE POLICYMAKERS A POWERFUL TOOL TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH REDUCE DISPARITIES AND CARE AND OUTCOMES. ADVANCE COVERAGE AND CONTAIN RISING COSTS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AS POTENTIAL REALIZED IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES MANY OF WHICH HAVE FUNCTIONING AP CD'S OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING. WE LOOK FORWARD TO USING THE HPD TO BRING DATA DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO HELP POLICY AND PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA. I OF ANY PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BUT STATE THE H. P. REQUIRES EXTENSIVE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROTECTION. OFTEN HAS EXPERIENCE WITH COLLECTING IN SECURING SENSITIVE PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND THE BILL FOLLOWS ROBUST PRIVACY PROTECTION AND DATA SECURITY PROTOCOLS. THE SECURITY PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CREATE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH OFFICE STATE AGENCIES AND OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS. CAN SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY USE AGGREGATED ANALYSES BILL FROM THE DATA CONTAINED IN THE H. B.% DATE. AND UNDER STRICT DATA SECURITY PROTOCOLS ALLOW QUALIFIED RESEARCHERS TO ACCESS THE UNDERLYING DATA ITSELF. THESE ANALYSES WILL OUT HER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BEST TO CREATE AND AFFORDABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT'S YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL AND OFTEN FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEIR TEAMS ALREADY DONE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE TO PREPARE FOR THE H. B. D. YOUR CROSS WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. PERFECT JUST IN TIME JUST IN TIME. LET'S NOT MOVE- TO THE PUBLIC AND TO SEE IF THERE. IS ANYBODY THAT WISHES TO ADD ON THEIR SUPPORT DISCERNING AIM IN ORGANIZATION. AND YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER MODERATOR AS A REMINDER TO PUT YOURSELF INTO THAT Q.

PARKER GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE KIND OF AN IN BETWEEN POSITION A POSITION OF CONCERN. WE ALWAYS LIKE THAT THANK DOCTOR WOULD FOR HIS AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THE TIMELINE THAT WITH ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. IN WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON AMENDMENT TWO ON DATA SUBMISSION WE HAVE FROM TECHNICAL CONCERNS AROUND THAT. BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT WE CAN WORK THEM OUT THANK YOU. GREAT I WAS JUST GONNA INTERRUPT YOU THERE FOR A SECOND AND SALES GOING TO GO INTO THE INBETWEENERS BUT I THINK WE GOT THAT COVERED TO ANYBODY ELSE THAT WISHES TO. TO ADD ON A WITH THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WILL GO TO LINE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE EIGHT ZERO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. LINE EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DAVID INVOLVED ABOUT HALF OF AMERICA'S DISAPPEAR ALSO IN SUPPORT MY THINK THE OXBRIDGE LEADERSHIP. AND THAT ENDS THE QUEUE. GRAYSON JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE IN BETWEEN IS OR ANYBODY ELSE THAT WANTS TO PROVIDE SORT OF A BRIEF TESTIMONY THAT'S IN BETWEEN. NOT HEARING ANYONE SAID AND WE WILL GO TO- ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS- WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL- WERE- SUPPORTED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY DATABASE BUT- WE MUST UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY AND WE'VE SEEN THE OUTLINE OF AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS WE HAVEN'T SEEN LANGUAGE IT MAY ADDRESS A ONE OF OUR ISSUES- SO MY TESTIMONY SHOULD BE TAKING IN THAT CONTEXT- JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND NUMBERS A BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS PARTICIPATED IN THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATABASE REVIEW COMMITTEE. OR PRIZE BOSCH PAD- PURSUANT TO EIGHTEEN TEN OF OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS COMMITTEE INCLUDING REPRESENTATION FROM A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING PLANS CONSUMERS LABORS IN PROVIDERS- THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED A SET OF CONSENSUS BASED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAS DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE EARLIER THIS YEAR. I'M IN OVER OUR OVERALL WE BELIEVE OUR POSITION ON ANY LEGISLATION TO ENACT THE DATABASE SHOULD BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE CONSENSUS BASED RECOMMENDATIONS- REGRETTABLY- AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY ON AS IT IS IN PRINT THAT VERGES FROM THAT- CONSENSUS DOCUMENT IN. A COUPLE OF KEY AREAS- NUMBER ONE- IT REQUIRES PLANS IN CARE YEARS TO FINANCE THE DATABASE AFTER THE FUNDING HIS HIS. EXPANDED WITHIN YOUR TO. I'M IN THE REVIEW INSTEAD THOUGHTFULLY RECOMMEND THAT OFF PURSUE YOU OTHER SOURCE OF FUN INCLUDING USER SCHEDULE AND OTHER REVENUE- WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THESE TYPES OF DATABASES. SO WE WOULD- RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THIS REQUIREMENT OF BE STRUCK FROM THE BILL- IN THE MORNING WHY NEED WE FEED ON REVIEW COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS- AB TWENTY THIRTY ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND CARRIERS TO SUBMIT CONTRACTED RATE STOSCH HEAD WITHOUT- THE BENEFIT OF CONFIDENTIALITY- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND- THIS RECORD WAS ALSO NOT A REVIEW COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION- AND OUR MEMBERS CONSIDER CONTRACTED PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS AS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION- AND THE- POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION. WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE- MARKET- IMPLICATIONS AND COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE NOT LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS SO WE ASK THAT THIS BE REMOVED AS WELL- CAP IS SUPPORTIVE OF ANY COMMONSENSE- IN REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE AFFORDABILITY IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR- HE'S OUT PURSUE THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY AND- HAS ATTEMPTED TO IMPACT HEALTH CARE COSTS. SINCE HE'S BEEN CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE WORKED HARD WITH HIM I TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS NEVERTHELESS- AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED OUT WE DO YOU OPPOSE AB TWENTY THIRTY. UNLESS AS AMENDED THANK YOU SIR THIS IS THERE ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION GOT THREE MINUTES LEFT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE BRANDED MARCHING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- WE MUST YEAH REGRETTABLY TAKEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL- UNTIL IT IS AMENDED TO BRING THE LANGUAGE I INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL. HE'S REPORT. I AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER COLEMAN STATED CMA SUPPORTS THE CREATION OF A PAYMENTS DATABASE AND UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. AS IT RELATES TO ADDRESSING COSTS. CMA WASN'T ACTIVE IN PARTICIPATING MEMBER OF THE REVIEW COMMITTEE AND WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROCESS AND THOSE. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LANGUAGE PREPARE WITH THE BILL PERTAIN TO THE DEFINITION OF MANTA. THERE'S PAYMENTS DATABASE RELY ON CLAIMS AND COUNTER DATA TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PHYSICIANS AND PAYERS. THEREFORE HEALTH PLANS ALREADY HAVE THIS DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE POSITIONS. PLACING A DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON PHYSICIAN PRACTICES OF ALL SIZES AND MODES OF PRACTICE RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF TIME A PHYSICIAN CAN SPEND DELIVERING CARE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. THE SHEER VOLUME OF DATA COLLECTION POINTS FROM PROVIDERS WOULD INUNDATE THE DATABASE AND RENDER IT VIRTUALLY INEFFECTIVE. IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE SUCCESSFUL CREATION OF THE MASSACHUSETTS AND COLORADO DATABASES. THOSE STATES HAVE NOT REQUIRED COLLECTION FROM PHYSICIANS NOR HAVE THEY EXPRESSED A NEED TO AS THE STATE'S ARE REPORTING THAT MANY OF THEIR SELF INSURED PLANS ARE VOLUNTARILY REPORTING THIS INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IN THE DATABASE CAN BE CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY AND THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION SHOULD ONLY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO QUALIFIED ENTITIES AND USE FOR APPROPRIATE PURPOSES. WITHOUT PROPER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THE BILL AS IT IS WRITTEN REYES THIS YEAR'S ANTI CRAFT CONCERNS. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AS THE BILLS FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WILL GO TO THE THOSE AT THE BY THE PUBLIC AND TO MISTER MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY ANYBODY ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO OPPOSE JUST THIS JUST THE- THE ME TO USE THE OUT ON. IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE AND HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD IN A PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE IN THE QUEUE CURRENTLY IT'S LINE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX THREE EIGHT SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF STEPHANIE WHAT CAN BE HAVE TO BE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE. COMPANIES ALSO WITH AND OPPOSE UNDOCUMENTED ATTENTION GREAT THANK YOU. NO FURTHER IN Q. GREAT IF THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SING NINE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE- BRIEFLY- RESPONSE WAS SAID THIS THIS DATABASE COULD BE THIS THE MOST SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING I'VE EVER WORKED ON THE LEGISLATURE. IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE WE NEED THIS DATA. SO I OBJECT TO THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T WANT TO- WE DON'T WANT TO REPORT CONTRACTED RATES LOOK I PRACTICED DENTISTRY FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. I HAD A RATE AND I HAD A CONTRACT AND- THE THERE WERE DIFFERENT THAT CONTRACTED RATE WAS ALWAYS LOWER THAN MY WILL CALL UP THE RACK RATE- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT CONTRACTED RATE IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE TRUE REFLECTION OF EXPENDITURES. AND IS REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE DO THAT- IF WE- WE HAVE BILL TEN CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS ANY PRICING INFORMATION THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL- IT WOULD ALSO BE EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO ACT WE HAVE BEEN CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS I THINK THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONAL- PIECE OF. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP US TO BE ABLE TO TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE NOT ONLY WILL WE BE ABLE TO USE THAT AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO DO A DATA DIVE TO UNDERSTAND. ARE WE SPENDING MONEY IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE OR ARE WE SPENDING MONEY THAT ISN'T AFFECTED FOR TREATMENT. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT PHYSICIANS THAT THAT THAT I'M HEARING FROM CMA THAT THEY DON'T WANT PHYSICIANS TO REPORT. THE LAST I RECKON THE LAST I RECOGNIZE WHEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR I PAID THE DOCTOR. SO YEAH YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THROUGH THROUGH A HEALTH PLAN. BUT IF YOU'RE A SELF INSURED PLAN- LIKE A LOT OF OUR LABOR TRUSTS THEY DON'T THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT MANDATED TO REPORT THAT SO WE NEED THAT POSITION DATA- UP FRONT. SO I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS- I THINK IT'S FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE. WITH THE GOAL THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE A- THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY.
