DO YOU JOIN THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING BETWEEN THE CENTER SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. WE WANT TAKE A MOMENT TO START OUT AND THANK THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT. CHAIRMAN STERN IN HIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR THE PARTNERSHIP ON BRINGING THESE. ALL STARS WHO OUR PANELISTS TOGETHER TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH AND EASTERN AND IT'S GREAT TO PARTNER WITH YOU SIR. WOULD LIKE TO BE TO LAY OUT THE AGENDA AND BOTH HAVE SOME OPENING REMARKS. THE LAST DECADE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. DUE TO WILD AND FIRES. NEVER IN OUR HISTORY HAVE WE SEEN SUCH DEVASTATION. PAIN AND DEATH. CAUSED BY SOME OF THE LARGEST WILDLAND FIRES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. FOURTEEN OF THE TWENTY LARGEST WILDLAND FIRES IN TEN OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE. HAVE ALL TAKEN PLACE. IN THE LAST DECADE. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SOME QUICK STATISTICS THE UNITED STATES WILDFIRE SEASON IN THE WEST. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DAYS. IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DAYS. TWICE AS MANY ACRES HAVE BURNED ON AVERAGE EACH YEAR AFTER THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND IN THE LAST DECADE WE SEEN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DEAD AND OR DYING TREES MOSTLY. IN THE COASTAL ANCIER RANGES. WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. CALIFORNIA'S NEW REALITY OR OUR NEW NORMAL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY THE STATE ADVANCES FIRE PROTECTION A RESPONSE. FIRE PREVENTION AND THE WAY WE BUILD OR CANDIDLY NOT BUILD IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. THE DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE. HEY WHY OWL THIS STATE IS ADVANCING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ENHANCE RESOURCES FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE TO HAVE HARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING RIGHT. AND WRONG WHEN THEY PLAN FOR AND POTENTIALLY APPROVED DEVELOPMENT. IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. AND CANDIDLY THAT IS THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS MOSTLY BEEN ABSENT. IN THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION RESPONSE. WE'VE NOT BEEN AS CANDID AND OR DIRECT ON BUILDING IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. WE HAVE BROUGHT EXPERTS TOGETHER FROM ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE TODAY TO INFORM OUR DELIBERATIONS IN. ANSWER VITAL QUESTIONS. ON HOW WE CAN BUILD MORE RESILIENT. FIND LANEY'S PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS. AND ENHANCE SAFETY REGULATIONS IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AGAIN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ALL STAR GROUP OF PANELISTS TODAY FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND I'M GRATEFUL AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO FROM OUT OF IT FROM THERE AND GONNA BE TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR STERN FOR INTERNET REMARKS IN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOUR COMMITTEES BEEN TREMENDOUS IN BUILDING THIS HEARING AND FOR YOUR COURAGE AND AND ASSISTANCE THROUGH THESE FIRES AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE. I WANT TO THANK YOU -- YOU GROW UP QUICKLY ED DOING DOING THIS WORK AND WATCHING YOUR WHOLE HOME TOWN BURNED DOWN. IS A LOT SO YOUR LEADERSHIP NOT JUST AT THE POLICY LEVEL BUT AT THE VERY HUMAN LEVEL IS MUCH APPRECIATED -- THESE ARE VERY HUMAN CATASTROPHES. AND THIS PEOPLE IT'S HARD. TO FEEL CONSTRAINED IN YOUR CHOICES WHEN EVERYTHING DOES SEEM NORMAL IN YOUR LIVING YOUR LIFE AND YOU WANT. TO MOVE INTO A NEW HOUSE AND YOU WANT. TO GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS BEGIN. HEY RELEVANT TO WHAT THE CLIMB IT'S DOING OR WHERE WILD VIRUS ARE WHERE YOU ARE ON A SOME HAZARD MAP. IT'S MUCH MORE CONVENIENT TO JUST -- LIB LIVER BOLIVIA SLEEP BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY ANYMORE AND I THINK TODAY IS PART OF THAT SORT OF SOBERING UP THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO IS CALIFORNIANS AND MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO. EITHER WE'LL BE WATCHING THIS OR OR NOT WATCHING THIS MAY LIVE AT RISK AND THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT -- AND CITY AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER LAND USE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW. THEY MAY NOT BE AS A WHERE I'D SO I'M I'M REALLY HOPING THAT WITH THE EXPERTISE PRESENT IN THE ROOM TODAY AND ALL THESE PANELISTS -- THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BRING SOME SOBRE TRUTH TO THIS CONVERSATION -- TO ASK SOME HARD QUESTIONS -- BUT ALSO STILL PRESERVE. THIS LIFESTYLE THAT HAS SO MANY FOLKS SEMI RURAL SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES HAVE COME TO EXPECT -- SO WITH THAT I'D I'D TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SEE IF THERE'S ANY OPENING COMMENTS AND THEN WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE FIRST PANEL. OKAY MUCH MISTRUST YEAR. MISTER CHAIR WAS A NOVEMBER SATURDAY I WAS WORKING AT THE AT MY OFFICE I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AND I COULD SEE THE SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS FROM MY OFFICE I WAS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR. AND I STARTED SEEING SMOKE. WHICH WE WERE WARNED IT WAS EERIE AMENITY AND WE ALREADY HAD A SHERIFF'S HELICOPTER UP IN THE AIR ALL MORNING LONG. MY BROTHER LIVED WHERE THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM MY YOUNGEST CAN'T. I CALLED HIM UP AND SAID WOULD YOU DOING TODAY. THIS IS WHAT I TAKE MY OLDEST TO SOCCER PRACTICE AND I SAID I DON'T THINK YOU ARE COULD YOU GO OUTSIDE. AND JUST LOOK AROUND AND TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE. THAT WAS CALLED THE FREEWAY COMPLEX FIRE. WAS TRAGICALLY LOST SO MANY HOMES. I TOURED THE NEXT DAY SUNDAY WITH CHRIS CONCEPTION WHO IS NOW HE'S UP HERE NOW. THERE WAS THE ROUGHEST TOUR I HAVE EVER. EVER BEEN ON SO YOU TRY AND THINK WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING. THE FIRE TO PROVIDE MIGHT MY ALARM COMPANY CALLED AND SAID. YOUR BUILDINGS ON FIRE. I BEAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO MY OFFICE. AND WE COULD NOT FIND. ANYTHING NO SMOKE NO NOTHING. WAS PUZZLING THE NEXT MORNING THE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WE WERE ALL ON THE BUILDING SITE. I WENT OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE CONNECTION FROM THE ELECTRIC LINE TO THE BUILDING AND IT WAS SO HOT THAT THE COPPER WAS DRIPPING. MORE OPEN ON MIGHT SHAKE ROOF. AND I SAID YOU OKAY NOW WE GOTTA GET WATER GET OUT YOU KNOW WHAT. SO. I WORKED ON LEGISLATION HOW DO WE PREVENT ELECTRICAL FIGHTERS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PREVENT WENT OUT WHEN A TELEPHONE POLE WITH ELECTRIC APPLIANCES. HIT AND IT SNAPS HOW DO WE PREVENT THE SPARKS. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE EVERYONE VOTED FOR THAT BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY THREE THREE YEARS AGO BUT BUT THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT. AND NOW WE'VE HAD MAJOR FIRES CAUSED BY ELECTRIC LINES AND THAT'S BEEN EMOTIONALLY DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE WE TRIED. TO DO SOMETHING TO START HARDENING THESE ASSETS. SO YOU DO A LOT OF RESEARCH AND YOU SAY WELL WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO. OBVIOUSLY A FEW. DECADES AGO WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA NOT TO YOU SHAKE ROOFS. YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL STOPPED -- BUT WHAT'S NEXT AND SO I HAD-SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE. WITH AN IDEA AND HE SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD PUT A WATER TANK UNDER THE PROPERTY WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR MOUNTAIN CABIN OR WHATEVER IT IS. I MEAN YOU HAVE SPRINKLERS ON ALL FOUR CORNERS AND MAY BE IF IT'S A RECTANGULAR YOU HAVE TO MORE IN THE MIDDLE. AND THEN YOU CAN USE YOUR IPHONE AND IF OF FIRES COMING. THE AT THE SPRINKLERS COME UP AND THEY SHOOT OUT. AND YOU COULD EVEN HAVE THE CHEMICAL POWDER THAT YOU COULD COMBINE WHICH WOULD BE A FIRE RETARDANT. SO PEOPLE ARE THINKING OF IDEAS OTHER THAN NO SHAKE AND MOVE THE VEGETATION AWAY FROM THE HOMES. SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME INNOVATIVE IDEAS OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS A MOTION WAS TOUGH AND NOW WE'VE LOST LIVES. AND SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR. AT THIS IS IMPORTANT IN YOUR LIKE YOU SAID IT IS WE'RE REACTING BUT WE SHOULD BE PROACTIVE GOING. FOR THANK YOU MISTER MISTER VICE CHAIR. MISTER JONES WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A IN THE OPENING REMARKS PLEASE. THANK YOU JUST NOT REAL BRIEFLY AMARI AL SCANNING THROUGH -- THE PAPERWORK HERE ON OUR DESK YOU'RE ONE OF THE PAGES IS A ALMOST COMPLETELY. DEDICATED TO MY DISTRICT -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ARE YOU KNOW RANGING FROM RANCHO SANTA FE IN THE WESTERN PART OF MY DISTRICT ALL THE WAY OUT -- TO ALPINE RAMONA. AND HOME ALL IN THE EASTERN PART. OF MY DISTRICT AND IS SIMILAR. IN A SITUATION WITH ME IN TWO THOUSAND TWO I GOT ELECTED TO THE SANTEE CITY COUNCIL. TWO THOUSAND THREE WE HAD THE CEDAR FIRES IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAD THE WHICH CREEK FIRES. AND I THINK ABOUT THE DATES AND NAMES RIGHT BY KNOWS POSTED -- THREE IN. OH SEVEN AND YOU KNOW. TWO THOUSAND CALLING MY FIRE CHIEF ENDS YEAH I I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS BEFORE. AND HE YOU KNOW HE DROVE ME OUT TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES -- WHERE THE FIRE HAD COME THROUGH MUSEUM ALLEY -- SO RAPIDLY THAT EAT. EVEN THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS MOVING THAT QUICKLY AND I THINK WE LOST -- SO A HUNDRED HOMES THAT PARTICULAR AREA BUT ELEVEN LIVES AND I I STILL REMEMBER DRIVING THROUGH THAT. AREA WITH -- MY FIRE CHIEF AND CARS BEING BURNED OUT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD -- WITH THEIR HEADLIGHTS ON BUT THEIR TIRES MELTED. AND AND AND AND AND SO YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE. AND SO -- I JUST. THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE I BRING TO THIS AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WERE YOU KNOW PAY ATTENTION STAFF AND HOPEFULLY TAKEN SOME PROACTIVE MEASURES. TO STIR STARTED DRESSING SINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR DID ANY OTHER MEMBERS SIR NIELSEN. I THANK THE CHAIRS FOR THE ATTENTION IN THIS HEARING. AND WHERE WE'RE AT AT THIS SO CALLED NEW NORMAL OR NEW ABNORMAL. IS THE PRODUCT OF DECADES IN THIS STATE [inaudible] OF NEGLECT. NEGLECT OF MANAGING OUR FORCE AND WILD PLANTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAZARD. IS A GREATER OFFENDER THAN THE STATE. AND THEY NEED TO TEND TO THEIR SHOP. AS WELL AS US. WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THE MAGNITUDE OF DAMAGE [inaudible] THESE FIRES. AND THAT THEY HAVE ENCROACHED NOW ON HIGHER POPULATED AREAS CITIES. I WOULD CAUTION THAT AS WE PROCEED. THERE WILL BE MANY THINGS DONE IN THIS NEW ERA. IT OUGHT NOT BE PREDICATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE DE POPULATE. THE FOREST AND THE WILD LANDS BUT THE LADY REVITALIZED. AND PART OF THAT REVITALIZATION HAS GOT TO BE PREDICATED ON SOME REMOVAL UP TIMBER [inaudible] COMMERCIAL. REMOVAL OF TIMBER AND MANAGING FORESTS THROUGH THOSE. SOUND FORCED PRACTICES AND ALSO [inaudible] GREATER ATTENTION. TO CO GENERATION. TO REMOVE SOME OF THE EXISTING FEELS [inaudible] DIRECTION. NOT ONLY THERE BUT THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS A PROBLEM. HE SHE WAS THE TIMBER INDUSTRY DEMISE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE POLICIES THAT HAVE DISCOURAGED COGENERATION. THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS NOT THERE NOW. TO MANAGE THOSE FORCED AND WILDLIFE'S. INDEED WE NEED TO DO MORE. WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENTS. BUT CAL FIRE TO ASSIST THEM LAST YEAR. WE MADE SOME ADVANCES -- WITH THEIR AERIAL CAPABILITY. IT'S GONNA BE A LONG WAY BACK. WHAT WE ARE IN THE THROES OF ARTICULATING HERE? IN THIS LEGISLATURE. IN PARTICULAR THE COMMITTEE LIKE THIS. IS NEW LONG TERM SUSTAINED POLICY. FOR MANAGING THE FORCE. AND THE WILD PLANTS. ONE ONE LAST OBSERVATION [inaudible] PROBLEM [inaudible] THE CAMPFIRE. ON THE RIDGE. AND IN PARADISE. THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH FUEL. AND THAT FIRE. BURNED SO HOT. AND MOVE SO RAPIDLY HAS MANY FIRES ARE DOING. NOW. IT WAS INTERESTING AS I WAS UP THERE. WELCOME TO EVERY WEEK MENTALLY BUT LOOKING AT THE SCORCHED LARGER ESTABLISHED TREES BLACK. TEN FIFTEEN FEET UP. AND SOME OF THOSE TREES ARE GONNA BE WEAKENED. IT WILL HAVE TO BE REMOVED SOME WILL REMAIN. BUT THE CANOPIES OF MOST OF THOSE TREES. WERE ATTACKED BECAUSE OF FIRE WENT SO FAST. IT DIDN'T RATE JUMPED IN THE CANOPY. SO THE HOPE FOR AREAS LIKE PARADISE IS THAT BEAUTIFUL AESTHETICS. OF LIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS. IN FIFTEEN OR SO YEARS AS THINGS GO BACK. THEY'LL HAVE THE CANOPY THERE. TO COME BACK. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A THANKS TO ALL OF YOU HERE WHO HAVE YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR RESOLVE TO HELP CHANGE. TO A NEW DYNAMIC. NOT A NEW NORMAL. BUT A NEW HEALTHIER HAPPIER. RURAL. AND EVEN IRVINE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. YOUR RIGHT OVER THERE SENATE CAREER OKAY VERY GOOD LET'S GET STARTED THEN. LET'S LET'S GET START WE GOT SOME -- BUSY FOLKS WAITING TO TESTIFY SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WE'RE GONNA START OUR SECOND PANEL I DID WANT -- TO TO NOTE FOR FOR THOSE IN ATTENDANCE THE MEMBERS MAY BE COMING IN AND NOW WE'VE GOT A G. LACK MEETING THIS MORNING SO IF YOU SEE SOME MEMBERS CYCLE AND NOW THERE'S ALSO A PRESS CONFERENCE GOING ON WITH THE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW AS YOU MAY SEE SOME. FLUCTUATION DON'T TAKE OFFENSE THAT PLEASE -- SO FOR OUR FIRST PANEL WE'RE GONNA INVITE UP BY CHIEF MICHAEL RICH WINE IS THE ACTING STATE FIRE MARSHAL -- WITH CAL FIRE -- SO WELCOME SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ATTENDING TODAY I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE RECENT TRENDS -- AND HOW THE IMPACT BOTH THE WILL WE WHICH I THINK WE'LL ALL GET TO KNOW THAT ACRONYM QUITE WELL AFTER YOUR REMARKS THIS MORNING -- AS WELL AS AN UPDATE ON YOUR FIRE MAPPING -- AND HOW WE CAN MEET. POTENTIALLY INTEGRATE THAT BETTER INTO OUR LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS SEES I ALSO WANT TO APPLAUD YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIMELY WORK IN RELEASING YOUR FORTY FIVE DAY -- HIT YOUR DEADLINE AND COMING FORTH WITH THE FUEL MANAGEMENT PLANNED SO -- I KNOW YOU ALL BEEN BUSY SO THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS MORNING CHIEF. THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR STERN AND TEAR MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TO PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YOU ON CAL FIRES WHILE IN FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL OF PREVENTING OR REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. OF THE UP WHAT I THOUGHT I WOULD DO IS JUST -- GIVE YOU A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN OUR PROGRAMS IN OUR WHILE IN WILDLAND ENGINEERING PROGRAM. AND THEN TAKE A LITTLE DEEPER DIVE IF IF I MAY INTO -- SOME SPECIFIC PROGRAM ELEMENTS NO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OVERGROWN FORCED AND PROLONGED DROUGHT HAVE RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED TREE MORTALITY IN THE STATE'S FORCED AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER. SIZE AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. LOSS OF LIFE AND STRUCTURES AS A DIRECTOR PROXIMATE RESULT OF WILDFIRES. IS AN ALL TIME HIGH HI. IN TURN CAL FIRE HAS SET ITS FOCUS ON INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE THE FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AS A KEY ELEMENT IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY WILDFIRES. WE USE THE STATE'S STRTEGIC FIRE PLAN AS A ROAD MAP. THIS PLAN WAS RECENTLY UPDATED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND SPECIFICALLYCALLS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FIRE PREVENTION AND LAND USE PLANNING. OUR WORK IS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT IN THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES. HAS BEEN LONG PART OF OUR MISSION BUT OVER THE PAST YEARS WE HAVE DOUBLED DOWN ON THOSE EFFORTS. IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED BY FUEL REDUCTION. WE HAVE TRIPLED THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND WE'VE INSPECTED OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOMES FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLARENCE. FACILITATED OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION GRANT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR LOCAL FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. AND WE HAVE ASSISTED IN THE REVIEW AND SUBMITTAL OF THIRTY FOUR LOCAL SAFETY ELEMENTS TO THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. CALIFORNIA'S DRY MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE HAS LENT ITSELF TO WILDFIRES. FOR CENTURIES. AND WHILE WE MUST TAKE EVERY STEP TO PREVENT AND SUPPRESS HUMAN BECAUSE WILDFIRES WE MUST ALSO ADAPT TO WILDFIRES. ADAPTING TO WILDFIRES IS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH. AND AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW THERE IS NO ONE SILVER BULLET THAT WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE HOLISTIC EFFORTS. AND IT MEANS PLANNING COMMUNITIES ARE HARDENED AGAINST WILDFIRES. WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND AROUND THE COMMUNITIES. IT MEANS PROPERTY EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES AND FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES. IT INCLUDES BUILDING HOMES OUT OF MEMBER RESISTANT MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING A ONE HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARANCE BY REMOVING DEAD. AND OVERGROWN VEGETATION. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT WELL IN BUILDING AND FIRE CODES IN THE WORLD. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NEW CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA'S WILDLANDS WE REQUIRES BUILDING MATERIALS. THAT ARE IGNITION RESISTANT. THE WELL IN URBAN INTERFACE OR WE WE BUILDING CODES ARE REVIEWED EVALUATED AND AND AMENDMENTS ARE RECOMMENDED AT REGULAR INTERVALS. ARE WE WE COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE BUILDING AND AND FOREST PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS. BUILDING AND FIRE OFFICIALS AND IN THE ACADEMIA WORLD SERVED TO ADVISE THE DEPARTMENT OF NEW AMBER RESISTANT PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGY. AND EVEN BUILDING TECHNIQUES. DURING A RECENT CO DEVELOPMENT CYCLE WE WE HAD FIVE PROPOSALS THAT WERE APPROVED. FROM THE WE WE COMMITTEE IN THOSE INCLUDED UL LISTED GARAGE DOOR -- WEATHER STRIPPING TO PREVENT KIMBER IGNITION IN THE GARAGE. ANY NUMBER RESISTANCE SCREENS OVER SKYLIGHTS. THESE WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION IN IN IS ADDED TO OUR CURRENT CHAPTER SEVEN A BUILDING CODES. OF COURSE THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT THE HOMES BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE ARE DEVELOPING A LOW COST BUILDING RETROFIT LIST. WE THINK THIS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY HELPFUL GUIDE TO HOMEOWNERS ON EASY HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL HARDEN THEIR HOME AGAINST WELFARE EMBERS. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE AND INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS TO UPGRADE THEIR HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE THE CURRENT BUILDING CODES. THE SERVER MUST BE COMMUNITY BASED TO AVOID INCONSISTENT APPLICATION. BECAUSE ONE HOME THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH RETROFIT CONSTRUCTION AND THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR IS NOT. IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. WELL THEM BOTH HOMES ARE STILL AT RISK SO REALLY NEEDS TO BE A COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. HOME HER NAME IS A CRITICAL STEP IN MAKING COMMUNITY FIRE RESISTANT. IN FACT -- DAMAGE INSPECTION ANALYSIS OF SHOWN THAT 93% OF ALL STRUCTURES TO CATCH FIRE DURING A WILDFIRE WILL BE DESTROYED. TIED CLOSELY TO THE WELL IN BUILDING CODES IS A FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS. THESE AREAS OR ZONES ARE BASED ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS FUEL SLOPE -- FIRE HISTORY AND EVEN WHETHER. OUR FIRE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM OR FRAPH USES THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND TECH AND DATA AT THE TIME. TO DEVELOP AND FIELD TESTING MODEL THAT IS USED TO IDENTIFY THREE INCREASING FIRE HAZARD AREAS OR ZONES. MEDIUM HIGH AND VERY HIGH. CALIFORNIA HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE THE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND MAPPING. NEW MAPPING WILL INCLUDE NEW FACTORS INCLUDE INCLUDING LAND LEASE LAND USE CHANGES NEW SIGNIFICANT WHEN DATA. AS WELL AS A MODEL THAT IS MORE SPATIALLY DETAILED. MAPS ARE IMPORTANT. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS WHERE THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWN TRIGGERS THE WELL IN BUILDING CODES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. OF COURSE THESE CODES APPLY TO ALL THREE ZONES IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. IT'S BEEN ASKED OF THESE MAPS SHOULD BE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY AND THE REALITY IS MOST OF THE FACTORS ARE CONSTANT OVER THE YEARS. WE UPDATE THE MODEL IS NEW TECHNOLOGY OR SCIENCE BECOMES AVAILABLE. FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE JUST COMPLETING NEW DATA ON AVAILABLE TO US ON SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENTS. THESE ISOLATED AND EXTREME WHEN THE BANDS HAVE BEEN AT THE ROOT OF THE SEVERITY CAUSED BY THE NORTH BE FIRES IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAMPFIRE AND YOU COUNTY. SO THIS NEW DATA ON MICRO CLIMATES IS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE REQUIRING REMAPPING. CRITICAL COME A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IS ALSO OUR LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM. THIS WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BY SENATOR KILOS BILL WAS IMPLEMENTED IN IN THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PLANNING AND BUILDING AND FIRE OFFICIALS TO ASSIST THEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THEIR GENERAL PLANS. PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION TO ENSURE THEY MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS BASED ON THE FIRE THREAT AND RISK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE IN CONTACT WITH FIFTY SIX COUNTIES AND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE CITIES. WHO HAVE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES? THIS YEAR WE WILL WE WILL BE ADDING THIRTY ONE COMMUNITIES WITH THEIR SCHEDULED SAFETY ELEMENT UPDATES. THEY PROVIDE YOU ARE OUR STAFF PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON STATE FIRE REGULATIONS TO THE LOCALS INCLUDING ROAD STANDARDS FOR FIRE EQUIPMENT ACCESS STANDARDS FOR STREET SIGNS AND BUILDING IDENTIFICATION. MINIMUM PRIVATE. AND PUBLIC WATER RESERVES FOR EMERGENCY THEN FIELD BREAKS AND GREEN BELTS. WE ALSO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH INCORPORATING WELL FIRE MITIGATION MEASURES. THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR CAL FIRE UNIT PLANS LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PROTECTION PLANS. OR LAND USE PLANNERS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SINKING THOSE PLANNING EFFORTS. WE'RE IN THE NATIONAL STAGES OF OUR WORK WITH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION REVIEWING SUBDIVISIONS AND WHILE IN AREAS BUILT WITHOUT SECONDARY. EMERGENCY EGRESS TO IMPROVE BOTH PUBLIC EVACUATIONS AND EMERGENCY ACCESS. OR WELL IN FIRE ENGINEERING PROGRAM COORDINATES ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION ACTIVITIES STATEWIDE AND ALSO MANAGES OUR DAMAGE INSPECTION RESPONSE. THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THESE INSPECTIONS HELP US ANALYZE HOW HOME IGNITIONS OCCUR. AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOME HARDENING IS DISCUSSED THROUGH OUR WE WE COMMITTEES. ANOTHER KEY ROLE THAT -- ANOTHER KEY PLAYER I SHOULD SAY IN THIS EFFORT. IS THE ROLE OF THE HOMEOWNER. IT IS KEY TO THE FIRE PREVENTION AS 95% OF ALL WHILE AND FIRES ARE CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY THE PEOPLE. THIS MEANS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED RESIDENTS AND VISITORS TO BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS OUTDOORS TO PREVENT SPARKING A NEW WILDFIRE. WE KNOW DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS THE LAW. IN OUR EFFORTS HAVE MADE GAINS IN COMPLIANCE BUT WE NEED TO EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ON THE BENEFITS OF HOME HARDENING. IS PROVEN TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SURVIVING A WILDFIRE. CALIFORNIA IS READY FOR WILDFIRE APP. IT WILL HELP HOMEOWNERS PREPARE FOR A WHILE FIRE IT'S AVAILABLE TO TO DOWNLOAD. AND IT HAS INFORMATION ON DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS IN TIPS INFORMATION ON HOME HARDENING AND AND SOME TIPS THERE AS WELL. AND YOU CAN EVEN SIGN UP FOR ALERTS TO NOTIFY YOU IN THE EVENT OF AN ENCROACHING WILDFIRE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. SO IN CONCLUSION OUR VISION IS TO MAKE OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MORE FIRE RESILIENT. MAKER HOMES IN INFRASTRUCTURE MORE FIRE RESISTANT. AND SHAPE SOCIETIES AWARENESS OF THREATS OF AND MEDICATIONS TO WILDLAND FIRE. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND I'M NOW AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. FAMOUS RICH. ONE YOU START OFF I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT WHEN IT COMES. TO SERVICE SPEED OF IMPLEMENTATION. SOME OF THE WORK YOU AS YOU'RE DOING ON THE ON SAY THE BUILDING STANDARDS SIDE -- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO NEW CONSTRUCTION CORRECT CORRECT. AND SO. WHEN IT COMES TO REBUILDING MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT ALSO DOESN'T APPLY NECESSARILY TO DIDN'T TO REBUILDS OF HOMES THAT CORRECT? AS WELL AS RETROFIT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE HOME OR BUILDING OWNER CORRECT AND SO -- WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY? THE PUSH FOR THE STANDARDS ON THE REBUILD EFFORTS SO WE DON'T. REPEAT THE MISTAKES THE PAST WE'RE GOING THROUGH A REBUILDING EFFORTS I KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR CITIES -- THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE WILL THE FIRE RIGHT NOW WRESTLING WITH THIS VERY QUESTION -- NOT JUST AROUND YOU KNOW DRIVE WAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT UNDER FIRE CODE BUT SPECIFICALLY THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES IS THAT AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT THOSE STANDARDS OR HOW DOES THAT WORK. WELL WE'RE WORKING THAT OUT THROUGH OUR WE WE COMMITTEE -- WE WE HAVE -- AT OUR LAST MEETING WE WORK IF I MAY USE THE TERM -- SPIT BALLING. I THAT COULD BE RELATIVELY LOW COST FOR HOMEOWNERS TO IMPLEMENT ONE OF THOSE IS IS SCREENING THE BENSON NEEDS -- THAT'S A FAIRLY LOW COST AS A MENTION THE GASKET IN IN IN GARAGES -- THAT'S AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WHERE AMBER IGNITIONS OCCUR -- SO THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO -- OBVIOUSLY CHAPTER SEVEN A HAS. LISTED STANDARDS FOR FOR GLAZING FOR WINDOWS FOR EXTERIOR CITING FOR DECKING -- SO THAT'S A THAT'S AVAILABLE AS WELL -- I A I THINK THROUGH THE BUT NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THE I'M TOUCH ME BACK UP. CHAPTER SEVEN A IS APPLICABLE TO NEW CONSTRUCTION A LOCAL ORDINANCE GOOD COULD TRIGGER IT THROUGH A REMODEL OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE DO FOR ROOFING IN SOME AREAS 50% OR MORE. YOU HAVE TO COMPLY -- OR OR YOU CAN BE EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE. BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE [inaudible] HOW CAN HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT THEIR HOMES AND IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF HOW BUT IT'S ALSO HOW TO HOW TO FIND IT? YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A BIG ISSUE TO IT. UNDER CURRENT LAW IT WOULD TAKE A LOCAL ORDINANCE EITHER THROUGH COUNTY OR CITY TO APPLY CHAPTER SEVEN A TO REBUILDING. IS THAT CORRECT OR SEVEN DAYS ADOPTED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL SO IT'S AUTOMATICALLY -- ENFORCE IT AUTOMATICALLY IT IS ENFORCEABLE FOR NEW BUILDINGS BUT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE LEGAL PACKED IMPLEMENTATION FOR NOT FOR RETROFIT BUT FOR FOR REBUILD. OR IS THERE. ONE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION OKAY. TIME ELEVEN TO GET BACK WITH YOU IN OKAY GOOD AND WE CAN WE CAN TEASE THAT OUT MAYBE IN SUBSEQUENT PANELS MY ONE OF THE QUESTION. WAS ABOUT. YOUR YOUR AT SEVERITY MAPPING -- HI IS THIS SIZE IT GOES RIGHT DO WE NEED TO GO HIGHER BUT WHAT IS EXTREME I THINK THIS LOOK LIKE THAT INCLUDES EXTREME. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE WITH THE WIND DATA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE COLLECTING WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO MICRO CLIMATES A TWO HUNDRED ACRES. OR OR TWENTY OR TWO ACRES OR LESS -- SO IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE THAT SPATIAL ELEMENT ALONG WITH THE WINDS -- IN A TWO KILOMETERS TWO KILOMETER GRID IS REALLY GOING TO GIVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION INTO THOSE MAPS. SO THE QUESTION YOU HAVE SIR IS IS WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO GO AN EXTREME LEVEL -- I THINK WITH A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNSIN THAT BEING TIED TO THE BUILDING CODES -- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD START SO WE I FORGET THE NUMBER PROJECTS THAT WERE IN YOUR EXPEDITED HAVE VEGETARIAN FUEL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. FORTY THIRTY FIVE THAT ARE THIRTY FIVE OKAY SO. YET THIRTY FIVE PARTY PROJECTS THERE BUT THE MAP OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH BIGGER SO HOW MUCH WITHIN THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES DIDN'T WE COVER. WITH THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY OUR CAL FIRE UNITS AS BEING CRITICAL TO PROTECTING THE COMMUNITIES IN THEIR UNITS. AND SO THOSE ARE ONES THAT THAT PRIMARILY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PLANNED AND AND FOR THE MOST PART PERMITTED AND ARE READY TO GO WE'RE READY SHOVEL READY ON THOSE. OKAY SO WE FELT THAT WAS THE BEST USE. AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE GETTING READY TO TO MOBILIZE ON I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PLACES I'VE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT I'LL DEFER TO MY FELLOW CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FUTURE FARMERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COULD YOU SEE SIR GOOD TO SEE YOU -- I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH FOCUS OF THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT MOVE LAST YEAR IN REGARDS TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ENDANGERING BEFORE. MAKING KALIFORNIA AROUND FIREFIGHTING FORCE OR FORTY MILLION RIGHT THING TO DO. RECALLING THEIR TAX BASE RIGHT THING TO DO. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS ALL THE APPARATUS THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET. BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE STANDARD -- WHEN IT COMES TO ENGINES BUT THAT'S JUST ANOTHER PLUS -- BUT THE WE'RE STILL TALKING IN COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUES OF HOME HEARTENING. AND I THINK I THINK WE'RE HERE. AND I'M NOT GONNA BUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH AND DISCUSS ANYTHING PROBABLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WERE NOW THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL -- STEP IN THIS PROCESS CAN BY THE HOMEOWNER. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN REGARDS TO HOME HARDENING. AT NEW DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT NEW STANDARDS ARE WE GONNA REQUIRE -- WHEN YOU SEE LANDUSE CHANGES IN THE MAPPING -- THE EIGHT WITHIN MAPPING THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT RIGHT NOW THAT'S WITHIN THE COMMITTEE WHAT IS THAT ME. ARE THERE COULD BE A CHANGE FROM AGRICULTURAL -- TO TO RESIDENTIAL COULD BE YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE OWNING CHANGES COULD BE FROM. FROM. FROM THEIR FROM WHILE IN TWO TO DEVELOPMENT IN AWHILE AND IS RESIDENTIAL COULD BE INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL -- SO THOSE TYPE OF CHANGES -- THAT WEREN'T INCLUDED BEFORETHE BECAUSE MAYBE THE MAPPING -- THAT WAS USING THE TWENTY FIFTEEN VEGETATION -- MAPPING. DIDN'T SHOW THOSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE AREAS AND SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT CHANGES SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN ENCROACHMENT OUT OF THE WELL AND INTO AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND SO THAT WILL BECOME A VERY HIGH. THE MOST LIKELY. WHAT TYPE OF RECOMMENDATIONS CAN WE EXPECT FOR PRE EXISTING HOMES AND STRUCTURES WITHIN THE WHAT WE? IT'S A TOUGH ONE SENATOR -- BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THEORIES VARIATIONS OF WHAT IS A RESIDENTS. IN IN THE WE WE BUT FOR A SINGLE FAMILY HOME -- YOU KNOW THE I THINK WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE -- LET ME BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT A LOT A LOT OF HOMES AND RESIDENCES THAT THAT TO OUR OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS. AND SO RETROFITTING THEM IS IT IS IT. THE CHALLENGE IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME -- AND AND AND DEVELOPMENT. SO. YOU KNOW WE WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS IN IN OUR WE WE COMMITTEE WE NEED TO FIND A WAY PERHAPS TO INCENTIVIZE. THE THE RETROFITS WE'VE DONE THAT AT POST DISASTERS WITH EARTHQUAKES. WITH THAT DONE THAT IN SOME AREAS ONE IS WITH OTHER FLOOD TO HAVE WITH OTHER OTHER DISASTERS AND ANOTHER RISK -- AND HEN THERE SB FUNDING AVAILABLE I THINK SOMEHOW TO TO HELP OFFSET THE COST. THERE WAS A GREAT STUDY THAT'S COMING OUT IN AND SOME OF THE PANEL MEMBERS BEHIND ME MAY BE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS THE COST OF RETROFITTING. OF FROM HAD ONE HEADWATERS ECONOMICS -- YOU KNOW THE THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IT'S FAIRLY COMPARABLE IF NOT EVEN CHEAPER. TO TO TO BUILD THIS BUT IN THE RETRO AREA BECAUSE YOU HAVE DEMOLITION COST AND YOU HAVE THE BUILDING BECAUSE IT DRIVES IT UP SLIGHTLY -- BUT SO IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO IN AND INCENTIVIZE PERHAPS THROUGH INSURANCE OR OR SOME OTHER FUN AND WORKING THROUGH THE THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN GRANTS IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE THAT MONEY THROUGH THROUGH NONPROFITS TO WORK WITH THE LOCALS AND WHO CAN IN TURN COULD HELP PRIVATE PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS AND LANDOWNERS. YEAH LOOK I THINK WE WHATEVER IS GOING TO BE ESTABLISH IT NEEDS TO HAVE THE SAME BIGGER -- THAT WE'VE HAD ON PUTTING MORE APPARATUS ON THE ROAD -- NEEDS AT THE SAME BIGGER OF REMOVING DEAD AND DYING TREES ARE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- BECAUSE GOING THROUGH THE THE NORTH A FIRE STORM -- WITH THE CENTER TO MY RIGHT GOING THROUGH -- THE TERRIBLE FIRES DOWN SOUTH AND AT THE SENATOR WITH THE CAMPFIRE -- TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE IN THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE FUND THAT WE SEEN IN FLORIDA -- THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO HARDEN YOUR HOME WHEN IT COMES PRE EXISTING STRUCTURES WHEN IT COMES -- TO HURRICANES I SENT I KNOW THAT BUT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE PACE LOANS -- THROUGH SPECIAL DISTRICTS I GET IT -- TO BE ABLE DO HOME HARDENING WHEN IT COMES TO HURRICANES AND THAT ALSO HELPS WITH THE INSURANCE RATING AS WELL. AND THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE TEAM ADMINISTRATOR TODAY -- IS. WHAT TYPE OF POTENTIAL STATE? FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP CAN THERE BE WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING JUST LIKE WE SEEN WITH -- RAISING HOMES WITH SLIDES YES AND OTHERWISE SAY YOU WILL NO LONGER BE INSURED BUT YOU HAVE TO BE IN IT BY THE WAY THIS IMPACTS FOLKS. BUT I WORK FOR EVERY DAY RIGHT ON THE NORTH COAST BUT WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO PUT PUBLIC MONEY BEHIND IT IN INCENTIVIZE. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE. IF I'M GONNA REMODEL HALF OF MY HOME THAT DAY IN TRIGGERS HOME HARDENING THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF TRIGGER TO BE A TO DO THAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT -- THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE CODE AS IT RELATES TO REMODELING -- YOU HAVE TO BRING IT UP TO CODE FOR OF SPECIFIC STANDARDS I COULD BE ENERGY COULD BE -- YOU KNOW BUILDING A FIRE EASY FOR EXAMPLE -- I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED A SENSE OF URGENCY. I I THINK -- YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING IN THE FAR MORE CELS UPS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BRAINSTORM THESE IDEAS. AND WE WE HAVE SOME SOME PRETTY SOME PRETTY -- IN WHO WORK WITH THESE PRODUCTS EVERY DAY AND THEY'RE WORKING THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE ISSUE AND AND THEY CAN SEE THE DEVASTATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE THE BUILDERS -- THE FORCE MANUFACTURERS THE BUILDING MATERIALS -- INDUSTRY IS IS PARTICIPATING IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS AS WELL ARE WE TALKING GUIDELINES OUR MANDATES. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- MANDATE SEEM TO WORK BETTER. BUT NO CAN BE VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT LET IT BUT IT COMES AT A COST IN AND THEN. YOU KNOW HOW MANDATE TO FUND IT. YEAH AND THAT'S WHY -- WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS IF? WE ARE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD THAT THERE IS JUST AS MUCH FOCUS. ON PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS. AS THERE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON REMOVING DEAD AND DYING TREES BECAUSE IT ALL GOES TOGETHER. AND ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE FOR AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL SAFER AT TIMES I HAVE -- OF EVACUATION. WHEN IT COMES -- TO EVACUATION ROUTES MANY THESE SUBDIVISIONS I KNOW AND I I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE REST OF STATE BUT I'M SURE AND CENTER NIELSEN'S. NECK OF THE WOODS AS WELL ONE WAY IN ONE WAY OUT. SO AT A MINIMUM A NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO MANDATE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING SOME TYPE OF RULE SUBDIVISION. YEAH YOU HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO GET TO GET FOLKS IN A NOW AND NOT JUST ON ONE ROAD -- BUT IT WOULD BE A LOOP HAVE YOU BEEN DISCUSSING THAT YES THAT'S OUR LAND USE PLANNING IN FACT WE HAVE -- IT'S A BUDGETED ITEM FOR THIS YEAR FOR THE PERSONNEL TO GO OUT AND DO A SURVEY OF THOSE EXISTING COMMUNITIES. AND THEN OUR LAND USE PLANNING FOLKS WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE LOCALS AS THEY'RE NOT ONLY OPENING THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS BUT AS ARE CONSIDERING DEVELOPMENT INTO THE INTO THE WE WE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS. AS IS A RESPONDING AGENCY OR THE FIRE DISTRICTS ARE COUNTIES IN THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT WATER SUPPLY IN THAT THY'RE SUFFICIENT FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES. BUT WE YOU KNOW WE ALSO THE PROBLEM WITH THAT -- THE CAMPFIRE. AND SO WE WANT -- TO WE WE IN FACT ARE CAL FIRE UNITS ALREADY HAVE A LIST OF THOSE THOSE CRITICAL SUBDIVISIONS AND SO WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT AND WORKING WITH THE LOCALS AS WELL. MY LAST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ON PREVIOUS DECISIONS ON LOCAL PLANNING UNDERSTAND THAT WERE LIVING WITH THEM. WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TOP THREE ISSUES? THAT CAL FIREOR MUNICIPAL FIRE AGENCIES FACE WHEN IT COMES A PRIOR DECISIONS AND BUILDING WHEN THE WILL BE WHEN IT COMES A RESPONSE. WHEN IT COMES TO RESPONSE YEAH -- CENTER WILL DO RESPECT I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE IN OUR OPERATION SECTION -- OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY IT'S ACCESS AND INTENSITY HOUSING PROP PERHAPS IS. ONE BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO CONFER WITH OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS IT'S GREEN I KNOW CHAIR AND I WILL ASK A RETIRED -- CAP ARCHIE TO MY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH. JAMES FROM RUSSIA. LET'S GO DOWN THE LINE CENTER MORE LUCK THAN THE SENATOR NIELSEN. WELCOME SENATOR BILL. THANK YOU CHIEF FRED RICH WINE I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE -- I KNOW THAT TYNESIDE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS QUESTION WILL BE KIND OF LONG BUT A JUST KIND OF GIVE SOME BACKGROUND ON ON THE FIRE MAPS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FIRE MAPS. FOR FOUR YEARS -- BECAUSE I HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT TO HAD A FIRE BACK IN NINETY THREE THAT. WIPED OUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE HOMES IN THESE ARE ALL OCEAN VIEW. AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN SANTA BARBARA AND OTHER PLACES -- SO. IN IN DOING OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT YOU. AS CAL FIRE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE CPUC [inaudible] TORANK THESE AREAS AS LOW MEDIUM HIGH I THINK THAT WERE USING TEARS LIKE TIER THREE WOULD BE THE HIGHEST. AND THEY WEREN'T COMPLETED THREE YEARS AGO AND AND I WAS INFORMED THAT YOU YOU YOU I USE A PRONOUN USE I APOLOGIZE THAT CAL FIRE AND THE CPC HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE MAPS FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEY WERE NOT. COMPLETED [inaudible] SO. I'M WORKING WITH UTILITIES TRYING TO GET THEM TO UNDERGROUND OR DO WHATEVER THEY CAN. I HAVE A A CITY AND IN MY DISTRICT ANAHEIM WHICH HAS ITS OWN UTILITY SYSTEM IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE AND AND THEY KNEW IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO UNDERGROUND AND AND TRY. TO MITIGATE IN WILDFIRES OWNS. BUT OVER TWENTY YEARS THEIR METHODICALLY BEEN [inaudible] ADDRESSING. THERE WILD FIRES ON SCENE SO THEY'VE GOT 98% OF THAT COMPLETED NOW THEY'RE WORKING INSIDE. THE CITY. TO UNDERGROUND ELECTRICITY ET CETERA [inaudible] ANSEL. WE'RE FINDING FROM UTILITIES ARE SAYING WHAT WE GET HARDEN OUR ASSETS BUT THAT'S ONLY GONNA TAKES CARE 60% OF THE ISSUE. I'M BEING TOLD BY THE CPUC YEAH YOU COULD UNDERGROUND IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT WE NEED THESE. POLLS FOR FIVE G. IN THE FUTURE AND ALL THE REST AND THEREFORE YOU GOTTA KEEP THESE BACK I HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS. FIFTY NINE POLLS THAT HAVE BEEN HIT AND TEN YEARS AND AND KNOCKED OUT. AND THEY'RE CARRYING HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG FEAR FOR THE HOMEOWNER IS NOT NECESSARILY HELP WELL THEY HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR WHOLE BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE THAT IS. FALLING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL IN THE MIDDLE AND I IT'S A POLL IT'S ALL. MIKE MY QUESTION IS. I'M EVE SAID TODAY THAT THE MAPS ARE DONE. AND THAT NOW THEY CAN BE REVISED BUT I JUST WANNA KNOW WHY IT'S TAKING SO LONG AND WHAT CAN I DO AS A SENATOR. TO GET THE UTILITY COMPANIES. THE GILMORE PROACTIVE I MEAN THEY'RE ALL COMING IN NOW BECAUSE I'M -- VICE CHAIR OF ENERGY. THE ROCK AND AND AND AND IT. ANYWAY THEY'RE ALL COMING IN AND SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. BUT OBVIOUSLY P. JEANNIE FAILED. MISERABLY ANOTHER IN CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY SO WHAT CAN WE DO THAT ENCOURAGES UTILITIES TO HELP THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN CHAPTER ELEVEN AS WELL. THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION I WANT TO CLARIFY THOUGH YOU SAID THE MAPS ARE DONE AND I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE THREAT DISTRICT MAPS THAT CPUC USES IN THE UTILITY ISSUES WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRE HAZARDS VERITIES ON MAPPING. STAR FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES ON MAPPING --% IS IS UNDER WAY -- AND WOULD BE BEGUN THAT PROCESS TO UPDATE THAT MAP IN IN THAT MAP REFLECTS. THE CONDITIONS OF THE WHILE AND AND AND AND INTO COMMUNITIES IT WARY WORDING CROUCHES. THE CPUC AND AND THE UTILITY MAPPING -- WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU WITH WITH THE CPUC CAL FIRE DOES -- WE HAVE A DEDICATED PERSON WHO WORKS ALMOST DAILY WITH THEIR STAFFING AND THEIR SAFETY DIVISION AT CPUC. AND WE'VE WE'RE NEARING THE COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW OF THEIR THEIR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT -- I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE BACK TO CPUC. AND THEN I'M NOT SURE THE PROCESS AFTER THAT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO TO REVIEW THOSE MAPS AND WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS AND I BELIEVE THE DEADLINE IS -- IS THE NINETEENTH HAVE THOSE BACK TO CPUC. SO IT'S KIND OF TAKEN SOME ELEVEN YEARS TO GET THOSE MATT. WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASON? FOR IT TAKING SO LONG I'VE THE LA TIMES PT OUT MAPS AND JUST A COUPLE MONTHS GO ON ABOUT MY TAKEN A WEEK I DON'T KNOW. I I CAN'T RESPOND TO THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG. A DROPPED IF IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW. TO MOVE THIS ALONG AND AND TO WORK WITH UTILITIES TO START. YOU KNOW START THE PROCESS TO TO BE TWENTY YEAR PROCESS BUT WE'VE GOT TO START IDENTIFYING WHERE THE WILD FIRE. HIGH RISK ZONES ARE IN. IN ANSWER PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY SO SO THANK YOU CHIEF I I WILL ADD THAT IS PART OF THE THREAT. THE THREAT PROTECTION THE THREAT PLANNING THAT'S INVOLVED IN THE WILD AND MITIGATION PLANS THAT THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS HAVE SUBMITTED. THAT WE ARE REVIEWING AND NEAR IN AND NEARLY COMPLETED THAT REVIEW. THE PROCESS AFTER THAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT TO THE ELEVEN YEARS PRIOR TO THAT. THANK YOU CHIEF. FOR THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE CENTER NIELSEN. AND WELCOME CENTER JACKSON BRED WIND -- A KEY PART OF YOUR RESPONSE HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE MUTUAL. EIGHT ALWAYS SHOULD SHOW IMPRESSIVE TO ME TO WATCH TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THE CONVOYS OF VEHICLES COMING FROM ALL OVER EVERYWHERE. OUT OF STATE EVEN OUT OF COUNTRY -- BUT PARTICULARLY THE RESPONSE IN STATE OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON CAL FIRE -- YES AS WE SHOULD. BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT. FOR LEGISLATORS KEEP IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS. LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND VOLUNTEER. FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE THOSE ALSO A PART OF OUR WHOLE RESPONSE MECHANISMS YES SIR. ANOTHER THING. THAT I HAVE ADVOCATED AND I HOPE WE WOULD CONTINUE TO EMBRACE. IT WILL REQUIRE. MORE SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUR MAIN STAY RESOURCE THE FUTURE. WHERE BY FOR DECADES WE RELY TOO MUCH ON IN MAY LABOR? INMATE LABOR IS NO LONGER IS RELIABLE. OR IS AVAILABLE. ARE YOU LOOKING AT NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEE SEE SEE IF WE CAN. GET THEM FUND. WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CCC'S AS IT RELATES TO OUR FIRE TACK CRUISE SO. SENATOR I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK WITH YOU ON THAT DEFERRED THAT TO OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO PREVENTION DOESN'T SPEAK FOR OPERATIONS AND I WANT TO GET IN THEY'LL GET AHEAD. AT SNAGGING IT WELL IT WAS IT WAS IT AN INSTRUCTIVE THAT LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO GET A SHE SHE SHE CAP OPENED UP IN PARADISE. AND AT LEAST IT WAS TO A DEGREE HELPFUL. THAT THAT WAS DONE. AND ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR IS THE SURVEILLANCE TO IDENTIFY THE FIGHTERS. THAT REQUIRES NO MORE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY. CAMERAS IT CETERA. TO IDENTIFY FIRES WE USED TO HEAD THE OF TOWERS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WITH PEOPLE STATIONED THERE. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THE FIRE SEASON -- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'RE DEVELOPING A LOT NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GIVE US. SURVEILLANCE OUT IN THE FORCE TO WILD LANDS. THE TO IDENTIFY FIRES. SOONER IS THAT CORRECT YES THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN ALSO AN ISSUE THAT HAS COME TO BEAR WE'RE DEALING WITH IT EVEN RIGHT NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT'S RAPID RESPONSE AND COMMUNICATION OF IDENTIFICATION AND NOTIFICATION [inaudible] TO CITIZENS. WELL BACK TO ASIANS. THAT IS ALSO A PART OF YOUR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE CORRECT I WORKING WITH -- YES YES THAT'S THAT'S TRUE. AND THEN ABOUT THE PRE POSITIONING AND PLACING RESOURCES. IN MOST LIKELY MOST VULNERABLE HIGH RISK AREAS AND ARE YOU EMBARKING ON A COURT OF A SCHEDULER PROGRAM TO BE DOING THOSE THINGS. CENTER I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS REALLY SUITED ENHANCE MUTUAL AID RESPONSE. NUMBER YEAH -- IT IT WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR FIRE CAPABILITIES HAVE CREWS RESPONDING CLOSER TO MOVE TO WHERE THE FIRES. WELL AND THAT'S KEY WITH THE GREATER FUEL AND ACTION CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE THESE FIRES SO MUCH MORE SEVERE. A REPETITIVE IDENTIFICATION AND RESPONSE. IS MORE CRITICAL THANK YOU. THEY SAID IN UNISON. I'M LOOKING FOR OTHER QUESTIONS IF NEEDED I DID HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP WHICH IS JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF COST ON THE REALLY SIMPLE THINGS. ON A SIMPLE RETROFITS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TIME AT THE GAS GETTING. AROUND THE GARAGES. THE THE THE AND THE VENTING SCREENING. WALK US THROUGH CROSSES BASICS THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME I WILL CERTAINLY GET OKAY. IS SO WITH. PORTER MAGNITUDE SENT I MEAN WHEN I TALK WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS IT. YOU'RE TALKING AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR JOB ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE SOME YOU KNOW IN NO I WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR JOB YES UNDER FIVE THOUSAND FOR SURE. SO OKAY WELL I DON'T HAVE THE FORTIFIED WITH YOU ON THAT I THINK I THINK YOU'RE HEARING FROM A LOT OF THE MEMBERS UP HERE IN INTERESTED AND EXPEDITIOUSLY -- NOT JUST LOOKING AT NEW CONSTRUCTION BUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. GET TO THESE HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SIMPLE OUT ANY OTHER WELCOME SENATOR MONEY SENATOR JACKSON'S YOU A QUICK QUESTION I DO. ON THE HARDENING ISSUE LAST YEAR I DID LEGISLATION ALLOWS ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER THE PACE PROGRAM -- HARDENING OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS I THINK A CRITICAL. PART OF THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION AND I APOLOGIZE SO I I WAS HERE ACTUALLY AT NINE THIRTY BUT YOU WEREN'T. SO WE DIDN'T START ON TIME AND I STILL GET CHIDED YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH. SO -- I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING PRESENT -- TO HEAR THIS BUT THE THE ISSUE OF THE HEART HARDENING CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU MENTION A FEW THINGS WHAT IS CAL FIRE DOING ARE THERE ANY PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE ADVANCING OR THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING. IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING HOMES IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF SOME OF THE EASIER FIXES IF YOU WILL THAT WERE SUGGESTED BY THE CHAIR -- IS THAT WITHIN YOUR BAILEY AND ARGUES OR SOMETHING WE COULD DO TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER PARTICIPATION BECAUSE YOU DO. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY INTERFACE IN THESE COMMUNITIES WITH WITH SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. YES AND AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ALLEN URBAN INTERFACE COMMITTEE. IT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF BUILDING BUILDING INDUSTRY FORCED PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS -- THE VENTING COMPANIES BUILDING FIRE OFFICIALS ACADEMIA AND WE'RE ALL BRAINSTORMING IDEAS AND TRYING TO SCALE THEM -- AS TO WHAT WORK WE GET OUT. SOONER RATHER THAN LATER -- SO THAT SOME OF THE IDEAS SUCH AS SCREENING NEEDS IN DANCE -- THE GASKET IN AROUND THE GARAGE DOORS -- THOSE THOSE ARE EASY FIXES BUT WE WE HAVE A COMPILED OUR LIST YET. I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE'S REQUEST FOR SENSE OF URGENCY IN THIS AND I WILL CARRY THE SPECTER WE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION IS THERE SOME TIME LINE HERE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME NICE RANGE BUT THAT MEANS THE YOU KNOW THE GROWTH OF THE FUELS AND WITH THE WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME PROBLEM SINCE YOU'RE ANYTHING WE CAN DO. BUT TO EXPEDITED AND WHAT IS YOUR TIME TABLE -- I DO NOT HAVE A TIME TABLE AT THIS TIME SENATOR -- BUT I WILL GET BACK WITH YOU ON IT ON THE TIME TABLE TABLE IN A PLAN. OKAY BUT THANK YOU CHIEF RICH WINE I THINK WE'RE TO WRAP IT UP HERE AND LOOK FOR THE FOLLOW UP -- AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE CHAIRED INTRODUCED THE THIRD PANEL BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR URGENCY HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR IN WILL BE HAPPEN -- BOTH I CAL FIRE ON DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THE ENTIRE SET OF COMMITTEES. WE'D LIKE TO BETTER NOW INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PANELIST. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY. MARK OR DO CHIEF WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ALL UNDER THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT ROBERT FINISH YOUR TODAY'S REGIONAL MINISTER FOR FEMA REGION NINE OVERSEAS -- THE ENTIRE WEST COAST IN OUT IN THE PACIFIC -- JUST ON A PERSONAL NOTE I KNOW THAT MANY ON THIS PANEL HAVE WORK WITH BOTH MR FITNESS OCCUR THE CHEEK -- THERE THE DREAM TEAM THE DYNAMIC DUO -- WHO HAD BEEN TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- IN DELIVERING IN OUR DARKEST OF DAYS -- AND I KNOW WHETHER IT IS SENATOR JACKSON -- A CENTER MONEY IN SENIOR STERN -- CENTER NIELSEN WE ARE FOREVER GRATEFUL WE'LL DO OUR AFTERMATH MASTERS AND HELP US REBUILD. THEY'RE GONNA BE FOCUS ON SOME VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS WE'VE ACTUALLY -- PROVIDED THEM WITH SOME QUESTIONS SO THEY CAN COME FULLY PREPARED TODAY. THEY'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES THAT DATA ACCURACY ON LOCAL PLANNING DECISIONS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHEN REBUILDING IN FIRE PRONE AREAS -- AND WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE. HIT BY FIRES WHAT FEDERAL AND STATE ASSISTANCE IS THERE THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND CAN THIS ASSISTANCE BE USED TO REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD MORE RESILIENT ME ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER FIRST AND FOREMOST TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE MERCY SEVICES MARKER DUTY TO BE A TO GIVE US A STATEWIDE FIRST PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE FEDERAL I AND THE MISTER FENTON IS NOT USUALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND AGAINST AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME. FOR DIRECTOR THE TWO OF YOU HAVE A COMBINED FIFTEEN MINUTES WILL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROMPT IN IF YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THAT -- JUST LET US KNOW THE FORESHORES CONSTRICTOR. WELL FACTIONS CHAIR AND AND KOSHER STAND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY -- AND I THINK I'M ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF OF THE OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY ON HOW DO WE BUILD MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND AND PREPARE FOR THESE EVENTS I WANT TO TALK. ABOUT THAT THE TOPIC OF HAZARD MITIGATION BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY VERY EXTENSIVE. HOW TO MITIGATION PROGRAM -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AND REALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES. I DO NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE -- LARGE SCALE EVENTS AND I AM OR IF HE'S BY DOWN THE RISK OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR. IN OUR COMMUNITIES HIS -- TO IS PRIORITIZE IN FINE HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS IN FACT. THIS IS AT THE NATION WIDE ENDEAVOR AND I KNOW THAT -- BOB BOB WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS AS WELL BUT A NUMBER OF STUDIES DONE. OVER THE YEARS YOU'RE SAVING CLOSE UP TO TWELVE THE ARE THE KIND OF STRUCK IN THE IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS SO THERE'S A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AS WELL AND OF COURSE THAT'S ECONOMIC -- IMPORTANT ECONOMIC FACTOR FOR COMMUNITY -- AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM TIME AND TIME AGAIN NOW THAT -- BYE BYE DOWN THE RISK WE REALLY BY DOWN THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF IMPACT -- IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT MEDICATIONS THAT EFFORT TO REDUCE -- AND FOCUSES ON REDUCING A LIFE A LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY -- BY LESSENING THE IMPACTS OF DISASTERS -- AND IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO TAKE ACTION BEFORE THE DISASTER CURSED TO REDUCE THAT -- THOSE DOES IMPACTS I MENTIONED EARLIER. EFFECTIVE MEDICATION REQUIRES -- THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE RISKS ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THE REGIONAL LEVEL -- AND THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE CHOICES OF BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS. SOMETIMES NOT SEXY PROJECTS LIKE -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROJECTS OR YOU KNOW MAYBE -- DOING A A MEDICATION PROJECT BEFORE YOU PUTTING IN A BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT WITHIN A A DOWNTOWN CORRIDOR -- INVEST IN THE LONG TERM COMMUNITY WELL BEING. NOT THAT WILL BUILD RESILIENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY -- AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS MITIGATION INVOLVES THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OF COURSE AND AND YES HAS BEEN IN DIALOGUE WITH THE INDUSTRY -- NOW FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND DISCUSS WAYS -- THAT THAT BOTH INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE STATE AND THE LOCALS COULD WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY TO BENEFIT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE AGREE HOWEVER THAT WITHOUT THE MITIGATION ACTIONS WHICH WE DO CONTINUE TO JEOPARDIZE -- ARE SUFFERS REAL RESILIENCE IT IS ALL WRAPPED UP IN SOMETHING CALLED THE CALIFORNIA HAZARD MITIGATION -- PLAN IT'S A DEVELOPED -- EVERY FIVE YEARS BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S THE STATE'S PRIMARY HAZARD MITIGATION. DOCUMENT. AND IT IS A PROVIDED -- TO ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BUILDING THEIR HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS. AROUND THE STATE PLAN -- PANIC INCLUDES AB OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN TAKE IT IT'S A DOCUMENT THAT IS -- SIGNED OFF ON BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEMA. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LOCALS IN THE AREA OF HOUSE MITIGATION ALL HAS TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE AS WELL YOU LEARN A FEW MINUTES THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING THIS MADE AVAILABLE FOR HAS MEDICATION THE COMES DOWN. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY ARE THE TO MEET -- SO ON THIS PLAN REALLY REPRESENTS OUR OVERALL COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING THE MITIGATION STRATEGY AND AND AND HOW WE CAN DO THAT THE STATE -- THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT THE THE PLAN -- HAS INCORPORATED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIMATE ADAPTATION COMPONENT IN FACT ALL PLANNING NOW THAT WE'RE DOING AT YES ACROSS THE BOARD -- ADDRESSES -- THE CLIMATE RELATED IMPACTS WHILE FAR BEING OF COURSE ONE OF THE RACE WE DEAL WITH AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. OUR ROLE AND YES IS REALLY ALL HAZARD ROLE -- SO WE'RE TALKING -- IN FRONT OF YOU TO A ABOUT WHILE FIRE MITIGATION -- YOU KNOW KNOCK ON WOOD WE COULD EARTHQUAKE PROBLEM OR A FLOOD RELATED PROBLEM WHICH WE JUST ARE GOING THROUGH SOME FLIGHTS NOW IN THE CINEMA VALLEY. SO -- ALL WE HAVE TO RE THINK ABOUT THIS FROM AT ALL HAD HAUSER DAHLE REYES PERSPECTIVE. THE THE PLAN WAS JUST UPDATED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND EXCUSE ME CAN BE FOUND ON THE YES WEBSITE. OUR YES -- BIG BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF DISASTER STRUCK CALIFORNIA -- WE REALLY ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT AND AND PUT IN PLACE LOCAL HAS OMITTED CATION PLANS AS A PRIORITY WE GENERALLY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD. SUCCESS RATE WITH THAT IT'S NOT A MANDATED ISSUE -- YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD IN FACT WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT THE GENERAL PLAN OF A COMMUNITY AND THE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN ARE TIED TOGETHER. SO AS THE BUILDING OUT THE GENERAL PLAN THAT HAVE A MITIGATION PLAN. IS TIED IN AND BUILD A CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS -- IN MITIGATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THAT COMMUNITY IS RISING AND IN THE LONG RUN -- NONE OF THIS IS MANDATED -- NOTHING SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IT BUT WE DO KNOW THAT -- TO BE ABLE -- TO TO I HAVE A HAS MITIGATION PLAN. AND OF COURSE WE 1100% -- AT THEIR LOCAL COMMITTEE WANTS A OF RECOVERY THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT PLAN IN PLACE ARM. SO -- THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACTOR -- TO THOUSAND OUTLINED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. ISSUES THE ATTEMPT WAS THREEFOLD TO GATHER HOUSING AFFORDABILITY MITIGATION INFORMATION FROM LOCAL LEVEL TO STATE LEVEL PLANNERS. ARE TO ENSURE THE STATE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN ACCORDING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PRACTICAL AND ENSURE THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE MADE AWARE OF THE HAZARDS OF FOUR ABILITIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. AND TO DEVELOP -- A PLAN TO REDUCE THOSE -- FOR AND YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. DISASTER MITIGATION PROJECTS AND MANY OF YOUR COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE STATE -- LET ME SAY THAT -- THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS THAT OF CALIFORNIA CAN RECIEVE WHEN IS A FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTER UP 220%. OF THE COST OF DISASTER CAN COME BACK AND HAZARD MITIGATION FUNDS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED BY THE STATE. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD AND HAZARD MITIGATION EFFORTS -- SINCE SIDE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FLOODS THAT WE HAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- WE HAVE RECEIVED UP CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN THE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE FUNDS -- INTERESTED PARTIES AT THE STATE LOCAL CITY NONPROFIT TRIBAL LEVELS -- SUBMIT WHAT'S CALLED A NOTICE OF INTERESTS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR HOUSE MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM. AND THEN THOSE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS INCLUDE ---OF INCLUDE REVIEW AND THAT WE DID FOR WORKING WITH THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN WITH FEMA ULTIMATELY FEMA SIGNS OFF ON THOSE. HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS -- IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE'VE WE HAD -- OVER SIXTY SIX PROJECTS THAT WERE -- IMPLEMENTED CLOSE TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS -- GRANTS TO DEVELOP -- LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN SO THERE IS A WAY FOR LOCALS. TO TO GET FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THESE PLANTS SO FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE TO HAVE A HOUSING MITIGATION PLAN IN PLACE -- WHILE WE DID BUT WORKING OFF -- BUILDING AQUIFER RECHARGE PROJECTS -- WE'VE THAT -- WORK IN DOING -- OPERATION BOLTON SEISMIC RETROFIT PROGRAMS AND IN -- WE DID -- INCLUDING -- NOT COMPETITIVE POST WHILE FAR REGION CONTROL INITIAL STABILIZATION PROJECTS -- PROJECTS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY TO INCREASE TO PRE BASING CAPACITY THAT WILL MITIGATE FUTURE REST OF MUD AND DEBRIS FLOWS -- WE'VE DONE SOME WORK IN SEA LEVEL RISE -- A COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST ARE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. AND PROJECTS FOR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND OF COURSE AGAIN PUTTING WORKING WITH A CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. TO A PROGRAM CALLED GRAYSON BOWL WHICH WAS WHICH WAS DESIGNED BY -- YES AND AND AND CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY -- THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT WOULD GO IN TO IDENTIFY -- HOMES PRE NINETEEN FORTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE WE ACTUALLY WOULD INCENTIVIZE RETROFITTING BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO HOMEOWNERS TO DO BASIC RETROFIT PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD SOLIDIFY THOSE HOMES ON OTHER FOUNDATIONS. THEREBY DECREASING THE POTENTIAL. FOR DAMAGE AND AND AND AND SO. THE THE OVER ARCHING SET OF OF OF EFFORTS -- FOR MITIGATION -- IS REALLY CRITICAL I WILL TELL YOU -- AS AS THE DIRECTOR -- YES I IT'S HARD SOMETIMES TO GET REALLY GOOD PROJECTS COMING IN FROM FROM COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT. THEY'RE NOT THINKING. ABOUT IT IN THEWAY THAT THEY COULD THEY NOT LEVERAGING THE PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT. ARE POSSIBLE -- BUT THERE'S ALSO -- REGULATION AND AND AND THE LITTLE BUREAUCRACY THAT COMES ALONG WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT THAT COULD BE SORT OF A DOWNER OF OF BUT COMMUNITIES WANTED TO APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM -- BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO STREAMLINED AS MUCH AS THAT AND AND AGAIN MUCH. MUCH THANKS TO BOB. KNIGHT FEMALE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO STREAMLINE THOSE -- THOSE BUREAUCRACIES ENSURE AS MEDICATION PROGRAMS GET PUT IN PLACE -- I THINK OUT YOU KNOW ONE BIG AREA RECENTLY THAT -- WE'VE SEEN IN THE CINEMA VALLEY FOR OF COURSE I THINK BOB WILL TALK ABOUT THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY THAT WAS PUT INVESTED YEARS AGO TO RAISE HOMES -- DOWN ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER VALLEY IN GREENVILLE -- PROVED TO BE BENEFICIAL DURING THIS PARTICULAR FLOOD THAT JUST HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO -- AND AS WE SPEAK -- AS A RESULT OF THE MODESTY TO MUD SLIDES SINCE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE ARE WE ARE. TAKING OUT ALL OF THOSE HOMES THAT WERE IN THAT MIGHT FLOW ZONE AND COMPLETELY MAKING THAT A A NON BUILDINGS OUT. SO -- YOU KNOW. A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS FOR EXAMPLE MOVING FORWARD BASED UPON A RECENT EVENTS IS PROVIDING WAIVERS FOR HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ON ON A HOUSE BY HOUSE BASIS. RESULTING IN LARGER SCALE COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION EFFORTS OKAY. MAYBE WORKING WITH CAL FIRE IN IN BEING ABLE TO AND FEMA BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE WHAT COULD BE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- DOING RETROFITS. WITH REGARDS -- TO TYPES OF ROOFING AND OTHER KINDS OF YVHS -- WINDOWS -- SCREENS KIND OF THINGS -- EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL FOR STRATEGIC LANDS PURCHASES AND HIGH FIRE. HAZARD ZONE SIMILAR TO WHAT'S THE POINT IN FLOOD PLAINS. ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT -- ARE POTENTIAL WITH REGARDS TO HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW -- ONE THIS IS NOT JUST A FEDERAL STATE PROGRAM THIS IS A FEDERAL STATE LOCAL -- NON GOVERNMENTAL COMMUNITY BASED LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT WHICH MEANS THAT. YOU KNOW -- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING A SUBDIVISION OR HOMES IN A HIGH RISK ZONE AREA I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE RISK IS BUT? WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IN THE HIGH RISK ZONE AREA -- AND YOU COME UP AGAINST -- THE ISSUE OF WE DO WE BUILD WE MITIGATE HOW WE MITIGATE. AND THEN YOU HAVE DEVELOPERS THAT ARE WORKING TO MINIMIZE THAT EFFORT AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE SUBDIVISION GETS BUILT -- I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S A A PIECE IN THAT AREA WHERE WE ALL NEED TO COLLECTIVELY BE. MORE HAVE MORE DIALOGUE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT -- THE FISH SHOULD BE. JOB ONE THEY HAVE A A A SAFE AND SECURE COMMUNITY -- AND THEN AND THEN DO THE DEVELOPMENT OR AROUND THAT TO WITHOUT US MY TIME BOB THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STRICTER RETIREMENT FOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR WILL GIVE YOU MEANT ONE MINUTE PROMPTLY OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MINUTES. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT YEARS OF THE CULTURE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IT WAS LIKE HE TOOK UP CITY FIVE SOMETIMES ALL I'LL BE QUICK FOR IT -- PARTNERS IQ -- SENATOR REQUIRE CENTER STERN AND OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF FORD'S WISHING YOU. MANY VIEW TOO MUCH IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- THAT NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE BUT THE LAST THIS IS LUNCH TWO YEARS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN WE HAVE SENSE. THEM SET IN INCEPTION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE SO WE'VE BEEN -- VERY BUSY AND CALIFORNIA'S LEAD UNFORTUNATELY -- SOME OF THE WAY WITH A MEAN THAT MARK. WELL THINGS ARE RESERVATIONS -- IN MY EXPERIENCE AND DISASTERS IS RESPONSE RECOVERY WORK. GOES BEST ONE IS FOR EARLY SUPPORTERS STATE MANSION LOCALLY EXECUTED. EVEN WHEN ALL LEVELED Là GOVERNMENTS ARE COORDINATED -- REALLY -- IT'S CRITICAL THAT HAVE PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES BEING PART OF THAT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY IN THEIR CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS THAT. THEREFORE -- WE REGULARLY ENCOURAGE -- THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCALS RIVER CURRENT IS THE INCLUDES AWARENESS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE AND COLLECTIVELY GAUGE RENT. BUILDING A A MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE -- RHYS FOR PEOPLE PROPERTY AND TAXPAYERS. I CANNOT OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR SPEND OF MITIGATION BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES. THE MOST CRITICAL TOOLS FOR REDUCING THE RESTORE MANAGE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND INVOLVES ONLY PLANNING. COULD IN ADOPTION ENFORCEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT -- AND DECISIONS THAT BALLOTS DISASTER RESILIENCE AND ECONOMIC REALITIES. ADDING -- TO THESE ACTIVE MEASURES THAT HELP MITIGATE AGAINST RISKS WE KNOW THAT INSURNCE PROVIDES FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST REST. ROOM RECOMMEND THAT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAN EASY CLEAN HOMEOWNERS RENTERS SEEK INSURANCE. AS A FINANCIAL BACKSTOPS TO ACTIVITY -- ARE TO BE ACTIVE AGAINST RISK. AND REDUCE -- RISK. DEVELOPER RESILIENCY CAPACITY -- BEFORE AN INCIDENT -- CAM REDUCE LOSS OF LIFE AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS. WE COMMITTEES ARE AFFECTED -- WE WANT TO SEE REBUILDING THAT IS SAFER SMARTER AND STRONGER. BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE PROPERTY OWNERS A COMMUNITIES FACE IMPERSONAL REFLECTS FOR THAT REASON AGENCIES CALLING FOR A CHANGE. AND THE CYCLE O OPPORTUNITY WE ARE INVESTMENT IN FRONT OF THE DISASTER CYCLE AND NOT IT THEN WERE TYPICALLY -- SETS. MARK TALKED A LOT ABOUT -- SUMMER NEW SORTIES AND THE COST AND EFFICIENT. BENEFIT RATE -- FOR MITIGATION -- FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED SAGE -- SIX AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT TO IF-- THAT -- WE'VE INVESTED OVER FIFTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- IN MITIGATION AND OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY BILL A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS FROM THAT -- IF YOU MY MANAGE SEVERAL MITIGATION PROGRAMS AS ONE MAKE SURE -- THAT WE'RE AWARE WHAT THOSE ARE -- WE HAVE GROUP RIGHT MITIGATION EVERY FIRE MANAGEMENT GRANT OUT THERE -- WHICH IS ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THE GOES DIRECTLY THE COMMITTEE AFFECTED MARK TALKED ABOUT OUR E. HAS A MEDIATION PROGRAM FOR FOR WHERE WE PROVIDE -- FUNDING DIRECTLY -- TWO OF THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS A 15220% BASIS OF THE DISASTER COSTS -- WHICH CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IS WITH BROTHERS NOW HAS A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF FUNDING -- IN THEIR MEDIATION -- COFFERS -- THEY CAN BE USED TO PREVENT -- RISK ALSO WE ARE PRE DISASTER MITIGATION -- WHICH IS -- THIS YEAR HAS BEEN BUDGET TO ONE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- TO BE USE. THOSE PROJECTS COULD BE USED FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE MEASURES SAYING NEXT IGNITION RESISTING CONSTRUCTION. EARLIER THAT YEAR I THINK IT'S FROM THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE SING HOMES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE'VE DONE IS PROVIDE MITIGATION MONEY -- TO GO AHEAD AND REPLACE ROOFS ON HOMES OR WERE BILL PREVIOUSLY THAT ARE NOT UP TO THE CURRENT CODES IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND WHO DID THAT WAS TRICKY FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK ON THAT A GRANT AND WORK WITH PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS IN THE AREA. TO TO DO THAT -- THE OTHER THING -- THE BIGGEST COMMIT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR AS HAZARDOUS -- FUELS REDUCTION -- SO OVER -- THE PASSOVER YEARS -- WE'VE TAKEN ON A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN THE FOURTEEN WORK WITH -- CITY CALIFORNIA -- TO LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES -- AGAIN NOT I THOUGHT TODAY -- IN THIS INFORMATION HEARING -- AND BEFORE FINISHING I WANT TO WRITE IS JUST A FEW POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION. IF WE TRULY WANT TO LOOK AT MORE WAYS TO CONFRONT AND ADAPT TO GO ON RISKS WE CANNOT ALWAYS BILLED. AS WE HAVE BUILT -- AND PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO REBUILD THE BUILDINGS -- INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUNITIES THE WAY WE BUILT IN THE PAST GENERATIONS. A CALIFORNIA HAS TREMENDOUS NATURAL RESOURCES AND BEAUTY -- A FIFTH GENERATION CALIFORNIA -- CALIFORNIAN BUT BILLION CERTAIN AREAS IN RIVR IN AREAS ALONG CLOSE -- AND THEN FORCES AREAS IN WHILE IN URBAN INTERFACE BRINGS ADDITIONAL RHYS. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS -- THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT LAND USE PLANNING. AS A FEDERAL OFFICIAL IS NOT MY PLACE TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE TO BUILD OR HOW TO BUILD. BUT TOGETHER -- WE DO WANT THE REST SMART AND MORE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. DISASTER MANAGEMENT WE ALWAYS ADVISE PEOPLE TO PUT. AS MUCH SPACE -- AMPLE -- AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE THREAT. THANK YOU CREW THEN TO PROTECT OR MITIGATE AGAINST THE THREAT AND LASTLY TO ENSURE AGAINST. THE REMAINING RHYS AT FEMA WE SEE TOO COSTLY HELP. SUPPORT AMERICA'S DISASTER SURVIVORS. RECOVERING FROM ANY DISASTERS A WHOLE COMMUNITY EFFORT THERE RELIES ON THE STRENGTH OF THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OF BUSINESSES AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND INDIVIDUALS. AS OUT AS THE AS DISASTER STRIKES ARE COMMUNITIES -- AND WE REBUILD WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT WILL ALSO A MAJOR TOO MANY MORE RESILIENT TO FEATURES ASTERS. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER MINISTER VERY GRATEFUL I'M GONNA START WITH A COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE AN OPEN IT UP. TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WORKS -- JUST IN YOUR CAREER. BRIEF RESPONSE ZERO MINE -- HOW DO YOU SEEN FIRE CONDITIONS CHANGE -- ONE SECURITY WHICH IS A FORMER FIRE CHIEF. THE SUGAR GOING THROUGH YOUR LIFE -- IN THE TEMA ORGANIZATION -- BRIEF RESPONSE ON THAT. WELL FOR ME I THINK THAT IT'S A SAFE SAY THAT OF THE THE KIND OF FIRES WERE SEEN TODAY. WOULD MAYBE BE SOMETHING WHAT HAPPENED ONCE IN SOMEONE'S FIRE SERVICE CAREER -- AND SO THEY WERE WE USED TO CALL THEM CAREER FIRES BIG HUGE VERY COMPLEX FIRES. NOW WE'RE SEEING THESE ALLTHE TIME -- CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE THE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED THE THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED I THINK THAT FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT WAS A HUGE FACTOR -- THESE ARE ALL CLIMATE DRIVEN ISSUES -- AND THE WE SCENIC IN KIRK'S MOVE OF OF PEOPLE FROM URBAN CENTERS TO THOUGH WE WE INTO AREAS WHERE THEY'RE GETTING CUT OUT OF THE RAT RACE AND THAT THAT PUTS MORE. PEOPLE AT RISK -- AND THEN LASTLY -- WE'VE MOVED WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS SHIFT TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY THE USE OF CELL PHONES FOR COMMUNICATION AND THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING -- THE BACKBONE OF THE RESILIENCY THAT SYSTEM -- THEY WERE ALL UTILIZING -- BE BE QUESTIONABLE SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE I WOULD SAVE IN IN MY TIME -- WHERE WE'RE SEEING A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SITUATION YEAH I THINK IT'S THE RATES FOR STAND THAT ISSUE OF TELECOM IN NEEDING MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO TELECOM KEEPING -- THOSE OPERATIONS NO MATTER WHO THE KERRIER IS MOVING DURING -- IN EVACUATION AND OR IN THE AFTERMATH AS WE SEE THE SYSTEMS EVEN SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS AND PLEASE PUSH BACK ON ME IF YOU THINK I'M WRONG. THE SMALLER VENCER COLLAPSING ENTIRE REGIONS WHEN IT COMES TO SELLING DATA FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AND I MEAN YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT IN OUR RULE AREAS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING. THE SERVICES ARE ARE NOT YET UP TO SPEED ANYWAY -- AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE THE CAPABILITY THAT EXISTS THERE EVEN IN A MODERATE OR A SMALLER BAD THOSE SYSTEMS -- ARE GOING DOWN AND SO -- IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO COLLECTIVELY WORK ON BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S A ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS AND AT PEOPLE THEY JUST THEY JUST ALL STEP UP AND AND AND CONSIDER. THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEPEND ON IT. IN OUR LIVES ARE DEPENDING ON IT IT HAS TO BE RESILIENT AND REDUNDANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR MISTER MINISTER. YEAH MY TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND FEMA MOST THAT HERE IN REGION NINE I I THINK I'VE SEEN -- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER THAT TIME OF FIRES. I THINK -- MOST NOTABLY IS -- JUST THE WIND DRIVEN FIRES THAT WERE SEEN NOWADAYS THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND FIRE TORNADOES AND THINGS THAT WE JUST REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN EVER BEFORE -- A AND AND JUST -- THE FIRES NINETY MOVING OUT OF THE FOREST AREA BUT INTO URBAN INTERFACE -- E. YOUNG THE SANTA ROSA JUST A BIG CHANGE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AT LEAST. GOT IT -- WE'RE DUE TO MORE RAPID FIRE AND TURNED OVER TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT CHANGES. SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT IN REGARDS TO THE LOCAL PLANNING DECISIONS [inaudible] AND CAN GUIDELINES CUT IT ANYMORE. OR DO WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MANDATES WHICH WAS THE SAME QUESTION FOR THE FARMERS. STRICTER. WELL I MEAN AS A AS A BUBBLE POPPING I MENTIONED YOU KNOW -- YOUR MEDICATION HAS TO BE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT TO THE PLANNING PROCESS YOUR GENERAL PLANS -- NEED TO HAVE A HAND IN GLOVE WITH YOUR MITIGATION PLAN -- I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE WORD MANDATE HAS BECOME. ALL YOU KNOW CONCERNING -- I THINK IN CERTAIN AREAS OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- I DON'T CARE FOR STATE GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- OR OR RESPONSIBILITY OF A OF A COMMUNITY YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY -- WE ALL SHOULD BE WE ALL SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON MAKING THAT THE MOST SAFE ISN'T SECURE NOW SOMETIMES -- COST GETS IN THE WAY -- AND I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER DIALOGUE AND BEING ABLE TO WALK TO WORK THROUGH THAT -- AS WE JUST ARTICULATED HERE THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS TO BUY DOWN THE COSTS -- SO I THINK THAT -- WERE YOU SEE MANDATE -- I I THINK FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT A LOCAL PLANNING PERSPECTIVE LOCAL PLANNERS NEED TO BE -- THINKING AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY THEY DON'T I'LL BUT I THINK THAT IN THE NEW NORMAL -- THEY NEED TO BE THINKING AOUT AS THEY APPROVE -- PLANS OR IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT APPROVING A PERMIT FOR A RETRO FIT -- THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE ENCOURAGED THAT THAT THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY BUILD THAT IN THE PLACE AND THEN. LASTLY THERE HAS TO BE ENFORCEMENT -- THAT'S A BIG PIECE THAT DOES NOT REALLY EXIST AND ENFORCEMENT -- CODE COMPLIANCE -- PETER GOING TO BEAT WASTE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD IN -- THE RESILIENCY THAT YOU NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT REQUIREMENTS ON A LOCAL LEVEL. MAKING THIS A BASED OFF OF SQUARE FOOTAGE. OUR WEEK IS A REQUIRED TO MANDATE. AND I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO GET FROM YOU I MEAN LOOK -- AND I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND YOU CAN RESPOND. THE AGENT MAKE  WHILE THEN FIRES ARE HERE THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY. BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LIMóN WITH SO. IS THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO BE A TO TAKE. ANOTHER STEP THE BILL TO KEEP FOLK SAFE AND CANDIDLY KEEP HIM ALIVE WELL THERE'S A THERE'S A SEVERAL WAYS TO DO IT RIGHT IF YOU LIVE IN A FLOOD PLAIN YOUR REQUIRED. TO HAVE FLOOD INSURANCE. IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE IN NO HIGHER WILDLAND ZONE IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AND YOU KNOW KIND OF A MISSION FIRST LINE DEFENSES HAVING APPROPRIATE INSURANCE. IF NOT THERE SHOULD BE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE. TO TO MAKE YOUR HOME MORE RESILIENT BUT REMEMBER YOU'RE BEING YOUR HOMES ARE IT'S JUST MATERIALISTIC ITEMS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A OF A HOME THAT YOU CAN GET OUT YOU KNOW AND COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE IN. AND GET YOUR FAMILY OUT THAT SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE ANY TYPE OF THESE CODE SHOULD BE DESIGNED. TO BEING ABLE TO SAVE LIVES IN. THE APP AND PROTECT PROPERTY BUT THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF AS YOU KNOW CENTERS THERE'S A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION IT'S UP AND DOWN. OUR SIERRA FRONT IN OUR WE WE THAT IS QUESTIONABLE IN THAT AREA AND SO -- MORE MORE THAT PARTICULAR YET CAN BE DONE IN AND I THINK THE WORD -- YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO USE THE WORD MANDATE REQUIREMENT -- YOU KNOW I'M I IN AUGUST. THE RIVER THAT EIGHT MANDATE REQUIREMENT IS TO SHOULD BE SOME A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY PLACE THANK YOU STRUCTURE. CEMENT SHOULD IDEALLY -- OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WOULD LIKE KNOWN TO LIVE IN A HAS ARE PRONE AREA BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S PRACTICAL -- IF COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO BUILD IN HAZARD PRONE AREAS THEY NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO MITIGATE -- THE DISASTER FENCE WILL SPACE WE TALKED ABOUT -- IGNITION RESISTING CONSTRUCTION HAS IT FEELS REDUCTION INSURANCE -- IN REGARDS TO PLANNING -- WE ENCOURAGE LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING BOARDS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS A FACTOR IN. THOSE REGIONS THEIR DECISION SENT TO LOOK JUST READ TODAY BUT LOOK INTO THE FUTURE -- AND AND HOW THOSE IMPACTS IN DECISIONS IN THE COMPOUNDING IMPACTS OF THOSE DECISIONS -- AFFECT YOUR COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TAKEN FACTORS QUITE FRANKLY THAT -- IT WITH REGARD TO CHANGES TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- SUPPORT RESILIENCE WERE TO BE ROSES ROADS WITHIN YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF ISSUES ON EVACUATION ROUTES BEING INSUFFICIENT. SEEMS LIKE TO ME WE PUT A LOT EFFORTS INTO EVACUATION PLANNING FOR A BUILDING MATT IN THE OF THE RIGHT NUMBER STEPS IN THE RIGHT SPACES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND DO WE DO THOSE FOR COMMUNITIES AT THAT LEVEL THAT WE DO FOR BUILDINGS -- WE NEED -- TO LOOK AT THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THE POWER SYSTEMS THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION THERE AND OFFER THE PRICE OF THE THE RIGHT WARNINGS. ASSEMBLY THINGS AREN'T SEXY IS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT IN HIS -- OPENING REMARKS BUT GREATLY IMPACT LONG TERM COMMITTEE RESILIENCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MINISTER LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS CONCERNS MISTER CHAIR. WELL THANK YOU BOTH WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT [inaudible] AND YOU'VE BEEN STEADY AND BRAZILIAN YOURSELVES SO THANK YOU. BOTTOM OUR HEARTS AND EVERYBODY DOWN SOUTH HE'S BEEN HURTING. YOUR A YES THE PARTNERSHIP IS IS HUGE AND YEAH WE WE WE NEED YOU -- HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE -- WE FOR OUR SORT OF LACK OF SAY ENTHUSIASM OR THROUGH PUT. ON THIS SORT OF HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECT PLANNING I MEAN DO YOU HAVE A SORT OF SENSE OF WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LEAVING ON THE TABLE BY NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. SCALE MAG ORDER MAGNITUDE WELL I DON'T NEED I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE WHAT FOR FIGHT I NEVER GIVE ANY MONEY BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I DON'T EVEN IF IT ON THE TABLE. LIKE A PLACE THAT I I I I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH -- THE KIND OF PRICE SOMETIMES WRAPPING UP HOLD. VERSUS YOU KNOW PUSH AND PULL -- THE GET GOOD PROJECTS I THINK THAT -- MAYBE I'M GONNA GET YOU PROGRAM IS NOT AS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES ARE NOT AS UNDERSTOOD IS THEY SHOULD BE -- WE WE WE ALWAYS TRY TO FIND WE GET THE PROJECTS ACROSS THE BOARD -- DONE BUT I WOULD JUST -- YOU KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE THE COMMUNITIES REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE THERE IS A COST SHARE. LET'S BE CLEAR ON THAT RIGHT AND SOMETIMES THAT COST YEAR IS HARD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MEET. AND SO THEY JUST DON'T GO DOWN THAT PATHWAY. AND SO WE'VE LOOKED AT WAYS THAT MAY BE. FEELING THAT COST SHARE THROUGH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS OR OTHER KINDS OF WAYS TO TO MAKE IT EASIER SOME. WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM SOME ARE SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT BARELY CAN DO THAT. BENNY LE MORE HELP GETTING THERE SO WHAT I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. JUDGE WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WE TALK ABOUT YOUR THE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE. I I THINK -- BY MANY OF MANY OF THE IF IT CONTACTS A WALL FIRE IS IS MAYBE IT'S REALIGNMENT OF ROADS COULD BE -- TO MAKE YOU KNOW BETTER VALUATIONS ALWAYS MAYBE ITSELF ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM -- MAYBE IT IS A MAKING SURE THAT THEIR BUT YOU KNOW. THERE PUBLIC FACILITIES THERE CRITICAL FACILITIES ARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS HARDENED TO THE GRACE IS THAT POSSIBLE -- AND OR IF THEY'RE WANTED TO RETROFIT PROGRAM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY -- WHERE IT WHERE -- YOU KNOW IT'S ORGANIZED AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- CAN COME TO THE TABLE AND BE PART OF THIS. AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE'VE DONE AND SEE A IN ALL THESE EARTHQUAKE ZONES. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OF TWO OR THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT TO THE HOMEOWNER. TO BE ABLE TO DO A RETROFIT OF THEIR OF THEIR HOME THEREBY ONCE THEY GET THAT RETROFIT DONE THEY TURN TO THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY GET A REDUCTION IN THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUM BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING THAT. REDUCE THE REST OF THE HOME SO IT'S A WIN WIN ACROSS THE BOARD BUT PIXAR COORDINATION TO GET THAT DONE AND DOES THAT SAME SORT OF RISK MITIGATION OPPORTUNITY EXISTS FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES MAN -- WE SEEN NEW LIABILITY EMERGE -- THERE'S LAWSUITS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY AROUND -- PLANNING FAILURES AT LEAST BEING ALLEGED -- ON BEHALF OF COUNTIES FOR THAT STATE YOU KNOW ALLEGEDLY IGNORING KNOWN RISKS -- BUT IF WE'RE PLANNING SMARTER SAY HAVING SMARTER EGRESS OR IN GRASSER -- SORT OF ANTICIPATION OF SLIDE RISK OR THINGS LIKE THAT -- DOES THIS ALSO APPLY TO THAT KIND OF PUBLIC IN IN PUBLIC INSURANCE IS MAYBE WAY TO SCALE THAT UP. WELL I MEAN YOU KNOW IT -- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT ONE I'M NOT GONNA CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLIED I WOULD MAKE MY TO JULIE I WOULD I WOULD SAY YES DID YOU COULD GET A PRODUCTION -- AS FAR AS A RAISE CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. ANY TIME YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING. FORWARD LEANING TO BUY DOWN THE REST THAT'S AND THAT'S IN THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY IMPRUDENCE THERE YEAH IT'S A PRUDENT ACTION AND AND ALSO COULD HELP WITH IN PLOY EASE -- THE POTENTIAL FOR WORKERS COMP AND OTHER KINDS OF I THINK WE CAN GET INSURANCE REDUCTION PREMIUMS I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT IF YOU PUT SAFETY ASPECTS WITHIN -- THE YOU KNOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE I I JUST I'M. I'M DRAWN TO AND I WANT TO GET YOUR REMARKS HERE MR BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ABOUT TO CONSTRUCT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS -- WHAT IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY OUT HAVE PERMITTED BY LA COUNTY? AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF FANFARE. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY OR ZERO EMISSIONS OR SOME -- SORT OF NEGOTIATION WENT FORWARD TO MITIGATE ELISE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. BUT WE'RE LOOKING THERE THERE IS NO -- INGRESS OR EGRESS TO THE ONE EIGHTEEN FREEWAY THERE AND SO EVERYTHING GOES TO THE FIVE FREEWAY FOR TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NEW HOMES. AT THE MOST HIGHLY TRAFFICKED REGION RIGHT THROUGH THE VERY HIGHEST FIRE SEVERITY ZONE IN THE WHOLE AREA -- HOW DOES HOW DOES CARILLO YES? HELP INFORM MAYBE THAT LOCAL PRINTING PLANNING PROCESS AND WHAT WHAT WHAT COULD WE SEE THERE HE LOOKED AT THAT THAT POTENTIAL BOTTOM BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT WASN'T WILL THE RIGHT WILL WILL THE WAS A LITTLE FURTHER WEST AND AND NORTH BUT A WRY. CERTAINLY WENT RIGHT THROUGH THERE AND BUCKLEY DIDN'T JUMP THE FOURTEEN BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT PARTICULAR REGION AND THAT'S REALLY THAT ONE OF THE EPICENTERS OF NEW HOUSING GROWTH AT LEAST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF RURAL POCKETS AND FOLKS ARE TRYING TO BUILD. CABINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE REAL DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IS HEADED IT FEELS LIKE THE SOUTH LAND AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY BUT IF YOU IF YOU. TO LOOK AT THAT RISK AND HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU ELEVATE THAT FOR LOCAL PLANNERS? THAT'S A THAT'S A I KNOW IT'S MAYBE A LOADED QUESTION BUT I WAS A LITTLE BIT THAT'S OKAY -- SO WE WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT -- PROJECT AT IT IT'S A HUGE PROJECT. THERE ARE NUMBER OF WAYS TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SENATOR YOU KNOW I WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE EARTHQUAKE RISK WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE FIRE RISK. YOU KNOW OF EVEN THAT AREA HAS FLOOD FLOOD PRONE PROTECT UP POTENTIAL OF FLASH FLOODS -- AND YOU KNOW REALLY THE THE THE LA COUNTY AND THE AND THE AND I AND IS THAT A IS THAT COUNTY JURISDICTION -- CS LOS ANGELES OR YOU KNOW REALLY NEEDS. TO YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEIR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND THEIR PLANNERS -- THEY'VE GOT A HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN -- THAT THE CLEARLY ARTICULATES WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD IN THAT RESILIENCY -- AND BEER THE ABILITY TO HAVE EGRESS AND AND INGRESS UP POINTS DURING A MONTH MORE THAN -- ONE OF A IN TIMES OF MAJOR EVENTS CLEARLY IS ARTICULATE THERE NOW I CAN'T TELL YOU TODAY WHETHER. THE STAFF MY STAFF SAT DOWN WITH THE COUNTY AS THEY WERE DEVELOPING THAT -- BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER PROJECT THAT WE SORT OF LOOKING AT BECAUSE IT'S ON THE SUSTAINABLE PEACE THERE'S REALLY. YOU KNOW ISSUES -- AROUND THAT AS WELL THAT WERE CONCERNED ONCE YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE SUSTAINABLE NOT RESILIENT YES RIGHT ACTUALLY THERE'S A WAY. I WANT TO MOVE ON BUT THAT REGIONAL MINISTRY OR DID YOU. JUST COMMENTS ON IS PUSH PULL DYNAMIC THAT THE DIRECTORS BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF STIMULATING -- MORE CREATIVE MORE COORDINATING COORDINATED PROJECTS FROM LOCALS I MEAN ARE YOU DO YOU SEE A SIMILAR TREND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE FOR IN FROM THAT HAZARD MITIGATION. YEAH I THINK WE NEED TO DO COLLECTIVELY A BETTER JOB AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO HAVE -- IDENTIFIED THE PROJECTS BEFORE THE EVENTS -- IT LETS THEM GO THROUGH QUICKER -- AND AND THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THEM ON THE RECOVERY. I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS -- YEAH WE DO A GREAT JOB RESPOND DISASTERS AND ALL THE FIREMEN AND MEDICAL AND EVERYONE'S THERE THAT BEGINNING IN PART OF THE RECOVERY PART THAT TAKES A LONG TIME AND AND THE NEWS IS GONE BY THAT POINT AND AND EVERYTHING CHANGES AND THE FOCUS IS HOW QUICK CAN I GET. MY HOUSE REBUILD AND WE NEED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT LED STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE AT THAT POINT. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THEM AS A TOGETHER -- SO THAT WE IMPROVE AND MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WERE. YEAH -- MRS SMITH IS GET -- CHARGES YOU TRY TO REBUILD YOUR HOUSE OR MISTRESS MRS TRIED REBUILD HIS HOUSE AND THINKING SINGLE AND WE NEED TO THINK. COLLECTIVELY ACROSS THE BOARD AS WE DO THIS AND SO HAVING PROJECTS. AND UNDERSTAND A RESTAURANT OR REDUCING CALIFORNIA PRETTY WELL BY NOW -- WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT GEOGRAPHICALLY WITH RHYS. AND WHAT ARE THE PROJECTS THAT MAKE THINGS MORE DEPARTMENT DID ARE TWENTY FIVE DEPARTMENT DID -- BY REPLACING BRUCE YOU KNOW UP THERE YOU KNOW SO DOING THINGS LIKE THAT WERE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANY TAKES ON A RESPONSIBILITY WHERE THEY SEE A RHYS HAPPENED SO THAT WHEN AN EVENT HAPPENS. THAT IS SHOVEL READY IT'S THERE WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR YEARS FOR TO GO THROUGH HIS STORE PROCESS OR ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WILL GET TAKE IT PULL DOWN FUND IT AND MOVE ON IN JUST GIVE US A LOT MORE DETAIL THE TRUCKEE PROJECT BEFORE IT WILL I THINK BE HELPFUL TO SOME. OF THE MEMBERS HERE. WHEN WHEN DID IT OCCUR AND AND HOW DID IT? COME ABOUT. IT HAPPENED -- I DON'T HAVE A THE DATE BUT I THINK IT HAPPENED OVER ITS -- IN KINGSBURY -- AND THEIR TAHOE IN TRUCK YOU FIRE DEPARTMENT -- TOOK ON A PROJECT WHERE THE NOLLIE REDUCTIONS DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- AROUND -- RESIDENTS BUT THEY ALSO DID A PROJECT WHERE THEY DID ROOF REPLACEMENT FOR EXISTING ROOFS THAT - THAT -- YOU KNOW NEEDED -- TO MAKE SO. SO THERE ARE PROJECTS WE CAN DO WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING FROM A BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT COMPLIES WITH DEEP ON HIS STORE STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION. BUT THE LET'S IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS AHEAD OF TIME WHERE THERE'S TO THE CHIEFS THE POINTS BEHIND ME THERE'S EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT -- MAYBE ARE RESILIENT -- WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE MITIGATION MONIES COME FROM THESE ASTERS TO DO THAT. WE DO THINGS LIKE DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE COULD DO HAS -- FEEL REDUCTION -- IN A NEW CONSTRUCTION OBVIOUSLY NATION RESISTING CONSTRUCTION WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE CLOSE REQUIRE ANYWAY WE REFUND YOUR CODE REGARDLESS. THANK YOU. THE SWITCH WOULD TAKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WE HAVE SENATE JACKSON CENTER ABOUT. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO JOIN IN AND THANKING YOU FOLKS FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS I MEAN WE WE HAVE SEEN OUR SHARE OF DISASTERS I THINK WE HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO FIGHT THEM TO REDUCE THE AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE. OUR OUR MUTUAL AID PROGRAM EVERYTHING I THINK IS IS THE MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY. AND APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD AGREE I DON'T USUALLY SPEAK MISTER MCGUIRE LANGUAGE SHE'S TOO YOUNG FOR ME BUT THIS IS THE DYNAMIC DO WELL HERE -- IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE BOTH WITH THE STATE THE MISTER GELLER TO CHI AND OF COURSE -- WITH FAMOUS WELL -- BUT THAT BEING SAID TO ME WE WE ARE AS GOOD AS WE ARE IN GREAT. MEASURE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF THESE. NATURAL DISASTERS FOR DECADES AND AND WE ARE GETTING A BETTER. SADLY -- AND BETTER THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE -- BUT I'M I'M KIND OF HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS OCCUR AND PEOPLE THINK OVER IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE -- AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF THIS HARDENING AND SO FORTH ARE EXPENSIVE -- SO. WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM I HAVE TO SHARE WTH YOU SOMEONE WHO LIVES NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE THE THOMAS FIRE ENDED IN WHERE THE DEBRIS FLOW OCCURRED -- INSURANCE. IS A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITHIN THOSE AREAS ARE FINDING IF THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE WILLING. TO EVEN. EXTEND INSURANCE ARE TRIPLING AND QUADRUPLING THE COST OF PREMIUMS MAKING FOR SOME PEOPLE DIFFICULT IF NOT UNAFFORDABLE. OTHERS OF US ARE GETTING NON RENEWED. BECAUSE WE LIVE IN QUOTE UNQUOTE HIGH RISK AREAS. SO I I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCENTIVE BUT I WONDER IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO JUST GIVEN THE HUMAN NATURE AS WE ALWAYS TEND TO CLOSE THE BARN DOOR AFTER THE ANIMALS OF LEFT. ANY OTHER INCENTIVES THAT MIGHT EXIST THROUGH THE STATE. THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO NOT ONLY GET OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CANDID ABOUT. WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF? STREETS IN MY COMMUNITY THERE ONE WAY OUT. WE WERE UP IN THE HILLS IT'S AT THE PROBABLY I THINK FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING THERE. AND THESE ARE RISKS THAT PEOPLE TELL -- UNTIL THEY HAPPEN. AND IT'S JUST THE HUMAN I GUESS WHAT I I'M INTERESTED IN IS THE HUMAN NATURE FACTOR. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WHETHER IT'S A CITY PLANNING FINALS BEEN BIG RESISTANCE IN IN THE MONASHEE TO WORRY ABOUT LIFTING HOMES UP FIFTEEN FEET REBUILDING -- UP AND THE COSTS OF SAUDI ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE ENORMOUS A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO WANT TO REBUILD THAT WAY AND YET WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A TOTALLY IMPERFECT SCIENCE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NEXT EVENTS GOING TO BE. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE A TORNADO. I MEAN IT'S A YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S FACE CLIMATE CHANGES HERE IN ITS IN ITS WREAKING HAVOC. ON THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY -- WHAT DO WE TELL THE PEOPLE IN THE SO CALLED HIGH RISK AREAS BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF PARTY CALIFORNIA TODAY THAT ISN'T HIGH RISK -- DO WE LET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES COME IN AND JUST BURY US. WITH HIGH COST INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO WE TRY TO WORK WITH OUR CITIES AND OUR COUNTIES TO FORCE THEM TO DO. SOME MAKE SOME VERY TOUGH DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT POPULAR -- THE END AND YET YOUR USER THERE'S MONEY WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE TO DO THIS. MAYBE IT'S MAYBE I'M ASKING A QUESTION THAT REALLY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OF US AS POLICYMAKERS BUT YOU FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EXPERTS DO YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS. pCOMMUNITIES AND HELP OUR NEIGHBORS. AND AND ALSO YOU KNOW LET'S NOT LET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OFF THE HOOK HERE. ARE THEY RAISING PREMIUMS JUST BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RISK FACTOR OR THEY DOING IT TO BE ABLE. TO GOUGE THE THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA GREATER GREATER LEVEL -- THERE A GET A LOT OF PLAYERS HERE AND SOME ARE GOING TO USE IS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED? AND THAT WE ARE STILL ABLE TO ACCESS SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US JUST A SMALL QUESTION [inaudible] YEAH. WELL ALL STAR THE HELLO BOB I MEAN -- SENATOR ROBB. IN AGAIN I THINK IT'S FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACHES ISN'T JUST. ONE ELEMENTARY ASPECT -- IT'S PUBLIC PRIVATE WHICH INCLUDES INSURANCE COMPANIES AT THE TABLE IT'S OUR COMMUNITY. BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THEMSELVES. WE NEED TO BUILD A CULTURE PREPAREDNESS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S IN OUR PLANNING IT'S IN OUR POLICY. IS THAT OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE CITY CANCERS THAT ARE MAYOR. AS WE YOU YOUR WERE FACED WITH TWO THINGS WERE FACED WITH EXISTING DEVELOPMENT THAT'S IN PLACE. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS THAT NEEDS TO BE RETROFITTED OR UPGRADED. BACK COULD BE PROGRAMS WHERE IN THE KICK IN THE CONTEXT OF WILDFIRE BECAUSE THERE'S A YOU SAID THERE'S SO MANY RISK. WE HAVE WE HAVE. WE HAVE EARTHQUAKE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IN CONTEXT A WILDFIRE YOU KNOW. HAVING -- THE THE THE CITY OR COUNTY PLANNERS WORKING WITH THE MERGES HE MANAGEMENT WORKING WITH -- I WAS AT A WE ANSWERED CAL FIRE AT THE STATE. OFFICE OF A POP GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH -- BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT OF HIGH SEVERITY SEVERITY FIRES JONES AND THEN AND THEN BUILDING SOME INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THROUGH SOME OF THESE MEDICATION PROGRAMS -- TO WORK ON WAYS TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE MORE HARDENED MORE RESILIENT THROUGH A COULD BE THROUGH CAPPING ALL THE EAVES IT COULD BE THROUGH PUTTING CERTAIN SCREENS ON THE WINDOWS. THE LITTLE THINGS THAT MATTER BUT BUT CAN BE OFFSET BY CERTAIN LOANS WE ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY LOOK. YOU WANT TO RAISE MY RACE BUT WHAT IT WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER TO HELP BY DOWN THE RISK WHAT CAN I DO AS A HOMEOWNER TO HELP. IN THIS EFFORT RIGHT TO BUY DOWN THE RISK BECAUSE I NEED INSURANCE AND INSURANCE IS IMPORTANT -- AND AND AND THEN AND THEN WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY SAY OKAY LOOK AT IT FOR A TIGHT. TIGHTLY IMPACTED AREA IN THE WE WE WE HAVE SMALLER ROADS OR OR PLACES AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTER IT BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT -- RAMANA CO -- MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE -- SIGNAGE PUT UP IN SOME TRAINING TO THE PUBLIC ON EVACUATION ROUTES THOSE SIGNS ARE CLEARLY ARTICULATED IN MARK PEOPLE NOW MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH OUR SON A TSUNAMI BACK. YOU ATION ZONES HOW TO GET OUT OF AN AREA VERY FAST AND THEN DIVERSITY PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO GO WITH THAT BECAUSE EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WE LIVE IN A HIGH RISK AREA WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GOES ON IN THE HIGH RISK AREA AND WERE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THAT. SO THAT'S SORT OF PRE VET POST EVENT -- YOU KNOW OF OR OR WHEN YOUR BILL BUILDING THE OTHER THE OTHER PIECE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY APPROVING. A DEVELOPMENTS FOR COMMUNITY CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD TO RESERVE REDEVELOPMENT THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE. TO APPROVE THAT DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT -- ARE ARE REALLY SELL DEVELOPERS PRIVATE SECTOR TYPE A LOT -- TRYING TO TO MINIMIZE THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE TO BUILD IN AS A AS A ETHOS OF OF OF OUR COMMUNITIES A SAFETY A COMPONENT DOES. DOES NEW DEVELOPMENTS FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHERE WE PUTTING DEVELOPMENT. I KNOW FOR A FACT SINISTER THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS IN BUILDING IN SOME PLACES UP IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS THAT ARE RIGHT DIRECTY IN THE PATH OF FUTURE FIRES I WILL GUARANTEE YOU. RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE YOU FOR WHAT ONE WHERE WE BUILDING TO HOW DO WE MITIGATE THAT AND WHAT IS A DEVELOPER RESPONSIBILITY TO MITIGATE THAT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY APPROVED THE PLAN. AND THEN THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT BUYS INTO THAT AREA KNOWS MUCH LIKE IF YOU'RE BUYING INTO AN AREA FLOOD PLAIN THAT YOUR INSURANCE BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO THOSE ARE ALL PRE ABOUT IDEAS OF COURSE THE POST EVENT IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY UNFORTUNATE OPPORTUNITY NOW YOU HAVE A DESTROYED COMMUNITY THAT YOU CAN CUT A BILL BACKS BETTER AND AND STRONGER -- MOVIE FOR BUTTHAT IS A HARD LESSON LEARNED TO DO IT THAT WAY AND OF AND IN THAT CONTEXT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. MOST COMMUNITIES DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO BUILD OUT A LONG TERM PLAN THEY GOT TO GET THE TAX BASE GOING AGAIN SO JUST LIKE BILL BACK. FAST AND BILL BACK EXACTLY THE WAY WE WERE BEFORE SO WE CAN GET THE TAX BASE GOING AGAIN AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE COLLECTIVELY. NEED TO BE MORE LEANING IN ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT BACK IT'S GONNA BE VERY FOR FUTURE. THANK YOU INSTRUCTORS SHORT QUESTIONS. BUT A VERY GOOD ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRUCTURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER GRILLER DILLER DO CHI -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT HEARINGS YOU BEEN. TO THIS HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE SO FAR THIS YEAR LOTS ARE YEAH. AND YOU VISITED PROBABLY WITH ALL OF US INDIVIDUALLY SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU I APPRECIATE -- THAT CENTER JACKSON GAVE YOU A SOAPBOX AND YOU TOOK IT AND I WAS. A GREAT ANSWER BUT I I'M KIND OF THINKING IS I'M WATCHING YOUR IN AND IN THIS YEAR -- THIS SORT OF IN A DIFFERENT QUESTION BUT HAVE YOU HAD IT. WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN AHA MOMENT? THIS FROM THE COUNTY HIT YOU BECAUSE YOU YOU HAD SO MANY POINTS HERE I'M JUST WONDERING IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE WELL THIS IS SOMETHING. A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THAN BEFORE. WELL I MEAN. THE EVENTS A PARADISE WERE JUST ON BELIEVABLE LITTLE THAT'S ALL I CAN DESCRIBE IT I MEAN I'VE BEEN TO MANY EVENTS -- I THINK BUT BOB WOULD AGREE WE WE THE THE THE AHA MOMENT. AFTER LOOKING GOING THROUGH THE SMOLDERING POWER AND I SOMEWHERE LONG LOST THE WHOLE PLACE BASICALLY. WAS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE DOING THIS DIFFERENTLY. THERE IS THERE WHETHER IT'S WHETHER WHATEVER THE DISASTERS BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU YOU FOLKS TODAY RIGHT NOW AND AND I'LL BE LONG GONE HOPEFULLY I'LL BE LONG ON POINTS HAPPENS. BUT WE'RE GONNA BE BACK HERE AGAIN IN ON THESE FIRES AS BAD AS THEY ARE ARE GOING TO BE NOTHING. FOLLOWING THE CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE IT'S GONNA HIT IN ONE OF OUR URBAN CENTERS RIGHT. SO IN AND THEN WE'LL BE REALLY TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW DEVASTATION ON THE LEVEL THAT WE'VE WE'VE LITERALLY NEVER COPYCAT. BUT THE AHA MOMENT IN IN PARADISE WAS THAT LOOK WE WE WE WE CANNOT WE WE HAVE TO THINK. DIFFERENTLY AND ALL ALL OF US HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE IT CAN'T BE NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES ANYMORE WE WE WE CAN'T BE NECESSARY POLITICALLY CORRECT AND SAY WELL WE'RE NOT WE DON'T USE THE WORD MANDATE BECAUSE GOT UPSET. SOMEBODY SOMEPLACE OR WEEK WE CAN WORK WE CAN'T YOU KNOW -- UP SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE INSURANCE WE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO COME BECAUSE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE ALL HAVE AND WE ALL CAN SOLVE IT WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST MINDS HERE IN. AND THAT USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND UNIVERSITIES AND ALL OF THE POLICY MAKERS -- LAWMAKERS COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAKE THIS THIS COME TOGETHER. THANK YOU THANK FRAWLEY WORK MISTER FENTON JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS -- OR MAYBE A COMMENT THANK YOU. THE FEMA -- I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE THAT WHEN A DECISION IS MADE TO HELP OUT A COMMUNITY. THAT IT IS NOT REVOKED OR USED AS LEVERAGE FOR SOMETHING ELSE IS THERE A WAY. THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. YEAH I'M NOT -- BUT I'M NOT SURE A KNOW THE CONTEXT BUT ONCE FEDERAL DISASTERS ARE DECLARED -- THE AUTHORITIES GIVEN TO ME TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FROM THE SAD FACT -- I PROVIDED -- TWO FOOLS EXTENT POSSIBLE -- MY PERSONAL -- THE WAY I PERSONALLY HAVE DONE IT IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS AS I TRY TO GO. TO THE GREATEST PART OF MY AUTHORITY -- TO HELP ACCOMPLISH -- AND GET THE SURVIVOR BACK ON THERE FOR COMMUNITY TO THE FULL SIX AND I CANCEL AYE. I TRIED TO GO -- TO THAT POINT -- THERE IS A LIMIT TO MY REGULATIONS WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO. AND FROM TIME TO TIME I HIT THOSE LIMITS I USUALLY TRY TO COMMUNICATE THOSE AHEAD OF TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS -- YEAH WHERE THE BLACK LINE IS ON THOSE BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY AREAS -- THAT WE DO THAT I BELIEVE IN -- YOU KNOW -- THE CARE VERSES A STAKE IN AND TRYING TO AND I I TRY TO COME UP WITH PROGRAMS THAT. HELP PEOPLE OF OTHER THAN YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW ME -- DO SOMETHING THAT -- WILL YOU AND ONE LAST QUESTION AND THEN AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU.

SO LOW ALL OR MODULAR HOMES -- AND TRAVEL TRAILERS ARE ACCESS THE GSA PROCESS AND WE HAVE DONE THAT -- BEFORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A FEW SOME FOR ACTUALLY PASSES Là OF FIRES THAT DID NOT -- WARD LE FEDERAL DECORATION LEVEL SO -- WE'RE GLAD TO DO THAT TRIBES OF TAKING THEM FROM US AND PRITCHARD AND FOR US SO THEY GO -- AND AND GET ACCESS TO THAT PROCESS IN ITS -- OFFICIAL -- PROCESS AND CHIU STATES THAN CITIES AND THEN GOES OUT TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT COULD PROJECTED THEIR THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU RICHARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT WOULD LIKE ME TO LOOK TO THE COMMITTEE OF ONE LAST QUESTION. AND THAT WOULD BE SO WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE COMPREHENSIVE THERE IT IS BECOME FRIENDS ARE APPROACH INSURANCE -- MANDATED BUILDING STANDARDS WITH EXISTING AND NEW CONSTRUCTION.

IN WHAT ABOUT STRATEGICALLY BY NOW PROPERTY OWNERS IF THEY LIVE IN HIGH FIRE. THREAT ZONE MISTER FENTON. YEAH WE I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD DO WE DO OFFER FLOODS OBVIOUSLY -- THERE'S A BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS THAT MUST BE DONE -- AND WE'RE GLAD TO ENTERTAIN THOSE PROJECTS AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THOSE ONCE IT'S DONE THOUGH IT TURNS INTO GREEN SPACE -- ANY BY OUT IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS OR FOR IN AND YOUR EXAMPLES GO YOU IN A FIRE PRONE AREA IF WE DID THAT IT WOULD TURN TO GREEN SPACE YOU CAN NEVER THEN BE USED AGAIN. FOR A BUILDING A THING ON IT BUT WE'RE GLAD TO ENTERTAIN THOSE PROJECTS AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HIM -- AND AS LONG AS A BE TO MEET THE BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS WE CAN GO AHEAD AND FUN WITH HAS MEDIATION FOR ME MISTER MINISTER MISTER DIRECTOR.

IN OUR DARKEST DAYS AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPRESS HOW GRATEFUL I KNOW MANY OF US ARE I THINK SO MUCH AND TURNED OVER TO THE CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. ONE ONE POINT FOR THE QUESTION DRILLING DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER MAYBE IN FOLLOW UP ABOUT WHAT THAT THRESHOLD IS BETWEEN MITIGATE HERBAL. RISK FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD VERSUS. IF IT'S TO THICK WHAT'S THAT THRESHOLD WHAT RIGHT. WHERE DO YOU DRESS THE TALKING WITH SOME DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS? THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CONCERN AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO MANAGE THAT OPEN SPACE INTELLIGENTLY IF WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DEVELOP THEIR BUT IS. I'M I'M ASSUMING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S IT'S IT'S SORT OF A GRAY AREA IS GRAY. COMPLEX AND AND IT DOES REQUIRE. I MEAN LOOK I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT'S THE FIRST. WHEN A BUILDING AT ALL THEY'RE I MEAN THEY'RE THE WE HAVE TO REALLY DO AN ASSESSMENT AND A GOOD STUDY TO DETERMINE? WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS COULD BE PUT IN PLACE -- YOU'LL GET A LOOK AT THAT. IT KIND OF FUELS BEDS THAT ARE THERE WHAT THE WHAT THE FIRE HISTORY IS WHAT ONE OF THE PREVAILING WINDS ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE FACTORS HOW DO YOU WANT TO BUILD STRUCTURE YOU WANT TO BUILD THERE WHERE THE BUILDING MATERIALS YOU'RE GOING TO USE. HOW MANY PEOPLE WHAT'S THE EGG INGRESS AND EGRESS AND SO THERE'S THEIR STUDIES THAT CAN BE DONE TO TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT AND AND THEN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT -- IT'S A VIABLE TO BUILD IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING NO WE'RE SAYING CONDITION OLE I MEAN THIS RIGHT YOU'VE GOT INTIMATELY THE AND YOU MAKE A LOOK WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE MEDICAID OF ALL THINGS AND THIS IS STILL. A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. WE WE SHOULD JUST NOT GO THERE AND SO. I WITH THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T TOUCH ON AND OF ALL THE SORT OF MITIGATION -- TOOLS WE'VE GOT IS ON THE POWER SIDE -- POWER IS LIFE IN IN THESE MOMENTS IS WHAT YOU KNOW KEEP IN URGENT CARE CENTER ONLINETO DO WITH VICTIMS IT'S HOURS ARE CELL INFRASTRUCTURE -- I HEARD AN IDEA AND I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON IT IN TERMS OF HAVING PROPER BACKUP POWER SYSTEMS IN PLACE -- BOTH FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND POTENTIALLY EVEN GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO RESIDENTIAL SCALE. BUT NOT I'M NOT SO MUCH ON THE GENERATION SIDE PER SE BUT BUT STORAGE OF OF THAT -- BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY GENERATION BUT IF WE HAD BATTERY BACKUP POWER FOR INSTANCE FOR ALL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE HI FI SEVERITIES ON THE STATE -- DO YOU SEE THAT IS A IMPORTANT TOOL FOR AT LEAST ON THE THE RESPONSE I DON'T KNOW DOESN'T ACTUALLY MITIGATE RISK NECESSARILY BUT WHAT WOULD IN IN ENTERING THESE DISASTERS I MEAN. THAT THAT POWER CHALLENGE IN REBUILD CAN BE WOULD WE BE BENEFITTED FROM. SORT OF MORE RESILIENT POWER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS. ABSOLUTELY CELL. BATTERY BACKUP POWER IS A GREAT THING THEY HAVEN'T -- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHERE EVERY GAS STATION HAS EITHER -- A SMALL GENERATOR CAPABILITY TO KEEP THE POWER RUNNING FOR FUEL SO THAT PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED TO GET FEEL WHEN THEY NEED IT BECAUSE WHEN THE POWER GOES DOWN. THE POPS SHUT DOWN AND THEY BASICALLY GO OF GOLD BOB YOU KNOW INERT -- THAT'S A SMALL THING THAT COULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT -- WITH THE NOW NEW TECH BATTERY -- SUSTAINABLE LITHIUM BATTERY BACKUP CAPABILITIES THAT COULD BE EVEN BATTERY -- IF FLORIDA BAY MANDATED THAT THEY THEY PUT A LONG PLACES SAID THAT GET GAS STATIONS NEEDED TO HAVE A GENERATOR POWER TO RUN THEIR GAS IS BECAUSE IN FLORIDA. WHEN THEY HAVE A HURRICANE COMING IN THEY HAVE TO MOVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE? THEY WERE HAVING GAS STATIONS THAT WOULD YOU YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE POWERS GOING OUT THEY JUST THEY THEY THEY COULDN'T DO IT SO. THEY REALLY LOOK AT LOOK AT THAT AND I THINK THAT THERE'S AS OF THINGS THAT - THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT AND AND YOU KNOW CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CRITICAL MEDICAL -- SENIOR CARE FACILITIES ARE BIG. ONE SPEAKER CARE FACILITIES GENERALLY OR DO NOT HAVE THE THE THE BACKUP POWER -- IN PLACE AND WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT WE LOSE THE POWER THERE ARE THE IT'S A HUGE. PRIORITY FOR US TO GET ANALYST TEAMS TO THESE FACILITIES IN AS MANY OF THEM AND AS THAT OUR SOCIETY AGES GREATLY. THERE ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER AND SO IT'S IT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WE COLLECTIVELY NEED TO FOCUS ON AND AND SO ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF MEDICAL HEALTH THINGS SHOULD HAVE. BACK UP AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT MITIGATES -- THE IMPACTS AND QUITE FRANKLY IN IN MANY CASES THAT COULD BE A MEDIC THAT COULD BE A PROJECT THAT COULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE MEDICATION PROGRAM SO THE COULD BE FUNDS TO HELP GET THEIR WE WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP GOING FORWARD ON THAT LIST. RIGHT HOW TO ACTUALLY AND IF THAT TAKES GETTING BETTER LOCAL DATA UP TO THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE WILLING TO GO THERE -- MORE I I PERSONALLY AM BUT IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE SOME OF THE SENIOR CARE FACILITIES ARE FOR INSTANCE AND MANY OF THESE JURISDICTION SO WE COME IN WE HAVE A DISASTER AND LIKE WHERE DO WE GO. WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT SO I I'VE HEARD THAT FROM LOCAL FIRE ON NUEROUS OCCASIONS -- HOW TO GET THAT DATA SAID RIGHT -- SOMETHING WITH HOPEFULLY WORK ON GOING FORWARD THANKS AGAIN. ALL RIGHT -- WE'RE GONNA. LET YOU GUYS GO TO YOUR IMPORTANT JOBS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE ND INDULGING US AND FOR ALL YOUR SERVICE AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD -- TO OUR I GUESS IT'S OUR THIRD PANEL NOW -- SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME UP DOCTOR MATS MORE MAX MORITZ WHO'S A STATEWIDE WILDFIRE SPECIALIST AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION -- AS WELL AS JEFFREY LAMBERT WHOSE -- COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF OXNARD PAST PRESENT ALSO THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER -- AND FINALLY CHIEF KATE DARGAN -- THE RETIRED CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHALL -- WELCOME TO ALL THREE OF YOU -- WE'RE GONNA DO FIVE MINUTES EACH IF THAT'S AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS -- I SUPPOSE I CAN DEFERRED WHOEVER'S GOT THEIR POWER POINT FIRED UP FIRST OR WE CAN WAIT. FOR WE CAN GET SOME HELP ON THE THE DISPLAY AND GO TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A POWER POINT FIRST. OR DO ALL THE OF POWER POINTS. OKAY SO WHEN WE START WITH A LEFT TO RIGHT THAT MY LEFT TO RIGHT WELCOME. THANK YOU ARE. DEFINITELY WORKS AS YOU MENTIONED CITY OF OXNARD ALTHOUGH ALL BE TALKING MOSTLY THIS MORNING ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CITY OF VENTURA. IN THE THOMAS FIRE ON IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ARE YOU ALL KNOW IT WAS AT THE TIME THE LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IT DIDN'T LAST IN THAT CATEGORY VERY LONG BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF FIRES SINCE THEN -- JUST THE BASIC FACTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE AND ENSURE WE LOST FIVE ENGINE TWENTY FOUR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ABOUT A HUNDRED MULTI FAMILY UNITS INCLUDING A MENTAL HEALTH A MENTAL HOSPITAL. IN OUR COMMUNITY -- I WANT TO FIRST ALSO THANK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAD A TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE -- BOTH CAL RECYCLE OUR CALVET CAUGHT FIRE AND CAL WE **** WERE ALL IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN OUR SUCCESS -- AND I KNOW SENATOR JACKSON LEFT BUT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR RECOVERY -- AND I I THINK THE FIRST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE TO THE PANEL TODAY IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AHA MOMENTS FOR ME IN THE RECOVERY SINCE I WAS IN CHARGE OF RECOVERY NOT THE FIRE FIGHTING PART OF IT -- AS A COMMITTED ON THE DIRECTOR AND THE CITY OF AN A A IS WE STARTED WITH THE WITH THE RECOVERY ON DAY. ONE WE WERE REALLY IN THE FIELD LOOKING AT THE EXTENT OF THE OF THE DAMAGE AND WHAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US FOR THE RESULT PROCESS ON DAY. ONE AND THE KEY THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE AND IMPRESSIVE WE HAD EIGHT THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY -- BUT I'M NOT SURE THE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO HELP CITIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO RECOVER SO ONE OF THE THOUGHTS I HAD IS IT IF IF THAT GOT THAT WHOLE COMMAND CENTER. CENTER WHICH IS AS YOU ALL UP TO TRIXIE IS IMPRESSIVE. HAVING A BETTER SENSE OF HOW TO HELP CITIES HAVE IT TO RECOVERY ACT ON DAY ONE BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO THAT. OUR COMMUNITY EXPECTED TO RECOVER AND REBUILD -- AND THEY WERE ASKING US THOSE QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A REAL PLAN AHEAD OF US WE GOT THERE. ARE THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS I I ALSO WILL SAY THAT WE ARE WE DID NEVER QUESTION THE IDEA OF REBUILDING IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE WERE SET UP WITH. BOUNDARIES -- WHERE ARE DEVELOPMENT LIMITS WERE BASED ON OUR -- PROTECTION AGRICULTURE AN OPEN SPACE SO THE IDEA OF REBUILDING WAS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR US AND WE DIDN'T SECOND GUESS THAT PROCESS -- SO WE HAD TO GET THERE PRETTY QUICKLY A AND SO THAT US SOME HELP THROUGH THE COMMAND CENTER HOW CITIES CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION TO RECOVER WOULD BE. REALLY HELPFUL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THE MANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ASKING THIS QUESTION AND DEBT I THINK THE OTHER PART MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS. PROTECTING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IS WE HAVE TO TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING HOMES BEFORE THE FIRE. ON AND I THINK YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T NEED. TO EMPHASIZE IT TOO MUCH THEY THINK YOU'RE HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT HOMES -- THAT ARE EXISTING BEFORE I FIRE ARE BETTER THAT'S PROTECTED ONE OF THOSE WAYS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WE HAVE MORE MORE ROBUST DEBRIS I SEE MOBILE MORE ROBUST -- REMOVAL OF VEGETATION AROUND HOME SYSTEM. IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE WE HAD WERE VERY GOOD ABOUT THE HOMES AT THE EDGE OF THE FIRES ON SO IN OUR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THOSE HOMES AROUND THE EDGES WERE VERY MUCH PUSH TO DO THAT THAT CLEARANCE EVERY YEAR. WE DIDN'T DO SO MUCH OF THE HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF HEY SOME OF THE HOMES AT THE EDGES DID BETTER THAN THOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE WERE FACED WITH THE HUGE AND VERY FAST FIRE -- AND THE FLAMES ACTUALLY JUMPED THE EDGE AND WENT INTO THE COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDDLE AND THOSE HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT PROTECTED BECAUSE WE DID NOT PUSH. A ROBUST WAY THAT THEY DO THAT CLEARANCE SO I THINK ANYTHING THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP ENCOURAGE MANDATE -- OR PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT CITIES CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT HOMES ARE PROTECTED IN ADVANCE OF A FIRE -- WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I I THINK THE OTHER THING AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT TOO IS HOW DO WE RETROFIT HOMES IN ADVANCE OF A FIRE -- THE BUILDING CODES ARE IN THE PROCESS BEING UPDATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY EVERY TIME WE'D UP CODES WE LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE FROM FIRES WHAT ADDITIONAL. RESTRICTIONS ON ON BUILDING CODES THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT MEETS THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS OF BEING MORE PROTECTED MORE FIRE RESISTANT IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION. BUT I THINK THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS HOW DO WE GO BACK TO RETROFIT EXISTING HOMES YOU ALL MENTIONED THAT A LOT ALREADY THIS MORNING. I THINK THE MORE THE STATE CAN DO TO PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS -- IN THE CODE THAT THAT WOULD PUSH THOSE -- BUT ALSO -- INCENTIVES TO HELP YOU DO WITH THE THE SEISMIC SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO HELP HOMEOWNERS UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE RESISTANT. ON BEFORE FIRE IT WILL STILL SAVE THEM AND ALL OF US IN OUR RESPONSE THE FIRES OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VALUABLE. EXPERIENCE I WILL NOTE ON A SIDE NOTE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT -- POST FIRE IS -- WE LOST FIVE AND TWENTY FOUR POOR HOMES WE WOULD NOW WE SHOULD PERMITS FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE HOMES TO START CONSTRUCTION. THOSE HOMES WILL MEET ALL CURRENT BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS RIGHT TO THE HOMES THAT SURVIVED THE FIRE. WERE BUILT IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE HAD THE SEISMIC EVENT THEY WILL NOT SURVIVE SO THE THE PEOPLE THAT GOT THROUGH THE THOMAS FIRE WILL NOT GET THROUGH THE NEXT EVENT SO HOW CAN WE DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE HOMES THAT ARE EXISTING. WHETHER IT'S SEISMIC OR FIRE AREAS ARE ARE ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN ADVANCE. I THINK THE OTHER PART IS IS FRANKLY CONTINUING TO PUSH CITIES TO BUILD INFILL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WHERE THE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE -- AND I I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT REPRESENTING THE CITY I WORK FOR DURING THE FIRE -- AND I WORK FOR CITY NOW IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A FIRE -- LIKE THE VENTURE DID BUT YOU KNOW AND ENSURE IT DOES DO INFILL IT'S OUR IT REALLY IS A CORNERSTONE OF OUR LAND USE POLICY BUT REALLY PUSHING MORE CITIES TO DO INFILL DEVELOPMENT -- AND AND KEEPING THAT EDGE ARE PROTECTED FROM DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING MORE HOMES AND MORE PEOPLE AT RISK I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT -- EFFORT FROM THE STATE TO HELPCITIES DO THAT -- I THINK THE MORE THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP AND ENCOURAGE CITIES TO EVALUATE THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS OF THEIR RISK POLICIES INCORPORATING THE RESULTS OF THAT. AND THE STATE I THINK CAN PROVIDE THE SORT OF DATABASE AND MAKE SURE IT'S A DATA DRIVEN POLICY DECISION AND THAT DATA CAN COME FROM THE STATE TO HELP CITIES BECAUSE WE'RE ALL STRETCHED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT. I THE MORE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE US THE DATA IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT DATA TO DRIVE POLICY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION. AND THAT DATA WILL ACTUALLY PROVIDE BETTER RESULTS FOR US -- GOING FORWARD. AND I I LOOK THE LAST THING I'LL MENTION BECAUSE I WANT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MOVE ON TO YOUR OTHER SPEAKERS IS. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AND AND PRACTICALLY FOUND IN OUR EXPERIENCE AND AND RECOVERING AND REBUILDING FROM THE FIRE IS. THE SORT OF A BUILT IN -- CONFLICT BETWEEN THE THE THE DESIRE FOR DISPENSABLE SPACE. AND THE DESIRE FOR A LANDSCAPING PLAN IN THEM THE MODEL LANDSCAPING PLAN ORDINANCE AT THE STATE DR -- INTO SOMETIMES -- SINCE COMPLECTED AND WE FOUND PEOPLE REALLY STRUGGLE WITH HOW DO I COMPLY WITH THIS MODEL LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE THE STATE MADECITY ADOPT. AND ALSO THE DEFENSE OF SPACE THAT ARE FAR DEPARTMENT ASKED THEM TO DO OR DEMANDED AND TO DO ITS PART OF REBUILDING SO I THINK MAKING SURE THAT THE CITY. HAS UNDERSTANDS HOW THOSE POLICIES A CONFLICT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THOSE CONFLICTS I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THIS MORNING AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER LAMBERT [inaudible] CHIEF JARGON. SWITCH OVER DR MORITZ. WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN HERE THANKS TOM? YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING YOU GUYS STARE AT A PICTURE OF ME FOR THIS WHOLE TIME SHOULD IN SOME FLAMES OR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING -- I'VE BEEN -- STATEWIDE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SPECIALIST IN FIRE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS -- AND DURING THAT TIME I HAVE DEVELOPED A RESEARCH PROGRAM ON HAZARD MAPPING EXTREME WIND EVENTS THAT BECAUSE MOST OF OUR LOSSES. CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING AND MORE RECENTLY ON LAND DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND HOW THAT. PLAYS A ROLE. AND I MIGHT THROUGH MAKE SENSE PROGRAM A TRY. TO TRANSLATE THAT FOR DECISION MAKING. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S COME UP ALREADY TO TO SORT OF DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHICH PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE I THINK IT'S IT'S GOOD WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR -- WE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO HAVE A WILDLAND FIRE PROBLEM OUT THERE RIGHT. THERE ARE FORCED LOS CLIMATE CHANGE BARK BEETLE KILL DROUGHT. THAT WILDLAND FIRE PROBLEM IS DAUNTING AND IT HAS A LOT OF LAND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SEPARATE FROM WHAT I WOULD CALL OUR HOME LOS PROBLEM OUR HOME LIFE LAST PROBLEMS -- THIS IS ONE OF OF WHERE AND HOW WE BUILD IT'S ONE OF HOW WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF THESE PLACES WHEN THERE ARE FIRES. AND THIS ISN'T A WILDLAND FIRE PROBLEM THIS IS A WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE PROBLEM RIGHT SO THESE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND I THINK THAT. TALKING ABOUT THEM AS SEPARATE PROBLEMS THIS. IS IMPORTANT SO I'M I'M ENCOURAGED BY WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY. THERE ARE THAT MANY HOMELESS STUDIES SURPRISINGLY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A COUPLE SOME FROM AUSTRALIAN SOME FROM CALIFORNIA. THIS IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO THE FINAL STAGES OF PEER REVIEW. I'M LOOKING AT THREE DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OVER FIFTEEN YEARS -- AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE LAST FEW LARGE FIRE EVENTS THIS GRAPH HERE BASICALLY SHOWS -- HOUSING DENSITIES AND THE RED BARS ARE THE NUMBER OF THE NUMBER OF HOMES LOST DURING FIRES. AND THE BLACK BARS ARE OUR HOMES THAT WEREN'T BURNED RIGHT AND WHAT YOU SEE FROM THESE DATA. ARE THAT LOWER HOUSING DENSITIES AND THIS HAS BEEN REPEATED OVER AND OVER IN IN OTHER STUDIES. LOWER HOUSING DENSITIES TEND TO BE WHERE WE LOSE MOST HOMES. RIGHT AND THAT'S DESPITE. EXCUSE ME THAT'S DESPITE SOME OF THESE. RECENT KIND OF CA AS I URBAN FIRES WERE WE LOST A LOT OF HOMES. THREE TIME IF YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER PATTERNS ACTUALLY LOWER DENSITY -- RURAL AREAS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST AT RISK AND THAT THAT'S KIND OF AN IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT POINT. I SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME THE LAST TWO YEARS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GOES INTO URBAN PLANNING AND LAND USE PLANNING WITH RESPECT TO FIRE. AND WHAT'S MISSING. AND SO ARE. WHAT'S BEEN KIND OF SURPRISING TO ME IS TO FIND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD. EFFORT AN EMPHASIS ON THIS ON THE BUILDING CODES AND THAT THE SCALE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURE. BUT AS YOU ZOOM OUT AND LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS. FOR A CITING A COMMUNITY OR HOW IT'S LAID OUT THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING ACTUALLY. THERE'S NOTHING CODIFIED ASIDE FROM INGRESS AND EGRESS AND A LITTLE BIT OF OF OUR WATER REQUIREMENTS. REGULATIONS THERE'S VERY LITTLE AT BROADER SCALES ABOUT HOW WE SITE AND LAY OUT A COMMUNITY WHICH IS KIND OF SURPRISING -- AND SO AFTER INTERVIEWING AFTER LOOKING THROUGH THE LITERATURE INTERVIEWING FIREFIGHTERS THAT OF WORKING FIVE MARSHALS OFFICES. INTERVENING LAND USE PLANNERS HOW THEY'VE INTERACTED WITH THEIR FIRE PROFESSIONALS AND HOW THE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS INTERVIEWING THE CALIFORNIA LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM TEAM -- I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WE MIGHT CALL BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOT CODIFIED IN THE NEED TO BE SO WE NEED STRONGER LAWS ON THESE ISSUES. THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF WORK THAT -- I AM INVOLVED WITH WITH A A COLLEAGUE AT BERKELEY THIS IS -- EARLY EARLY IN THE PERIOD YOU PROCESS BUT WE'VE COME UP WITH THE TABLE BASICALLY OF OF THESE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THE MALL I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW. PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WE ACTUALLY HAVE COME UP WITH THE A SERIES OF THESE THAT MAKES SENSE. SOME OF THEM INVOLVE GETTING FIREFIGHTERS OR FIRE PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED EARLIER. IN THE IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING CONVERSATIONS. A LOT OF THEM ARE ABOUT THE CITING AND THE LAY OUT OF AN ACTUAL. A NEIGHBORHOOD OR OR SUBDIVISION -- REDUNDANCIES. REFUGES OF LAST RESORT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET OUT AND CAN'T -- WATER SUPPLY REDUNDANCIES AN AUGMENTED -- SPRINKLER REQUIREMENTS. AND IGNITION MANAGEMENT UNDERGROUND UTILITIES SO ALL THESE EXIST -- IN THE LITERATURE OR IN THE MINDS OF OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE PLAYING ROLES ON THIS BUT THERE'S NO A FORTY THERE'S NO REGULATORY -- REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY REQUIRED THESE SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S NEEDED. FOR SO WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS LOOKING AT THE THE PROBLEM SEPARATELY I EVEN THINK THAT IF WE LOOKED AT WILDFIRE AS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. INSTEAD OF A LAND MANAGEMENT ISSUE WE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF PLAYERS DIFFERENT SET CONVERSATIONS -- AND HE'S COMMUNITY SCALE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WE CAN EXPAND THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH CRITERIA THAT'S ONE PLACE FOR THESE COULD GO. AND THAT GIVES THEM SOME WEIGHT THEY GIVE SOME SOME. SOME AUTHORITY -- THE GENERAL PLAN ASSESSMENTS THAT THAT CAL FIRE DOES. THOSE ARE ALL RECOMMENDATIONS. RIGHT. THEY GET TO WEIGH IN ON THE SAFETY ON THAT THOSE COULD BE MORE THAN RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE COULD BE MANDATORY. RIGHT THAT'S NOT MY I THINK SHOULD BE STRONGLY CONSIDERED ALSO THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHALS THAT ARE WEIGHING IN ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THEY'RE ALL RECOMMENDATIONS. TO THE DEVELOPER CAN COME BACK AND SAY NO I DON'T WANNA. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I DON'T WANNA MAKE THAT PERIMETER ROAD LOOK LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF THIS SO THERE'S NOTHING REQUIRED THERE EITHER SO I THINK THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHALS. COULD BE GIVEN SOME MORE. AUTHORITY AND THAT WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. A VERY GOOD THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO AN ENDO DOWN IN A FEW TOPICS BUT CHIEF TARGET WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. TEST TEST THERE AGAIN. AND LET'S GO. TO WRITE THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE BEING INVITED HERE TODAY -- SENATORS AND AND STAFF. SENATOR STERN YOU ASKED A QUESTION A PRIOR HEARING WHAT. IS THE RATIO OF AYE MITIGATION TO OTHER KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE TO BUY DOWN RISK AND I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ANSWER ABOUT WHAT IT COULD BE MY PROFESSIONAL. JUDGMENT OR X. EXPERTISE ON THAT IS IT SHOULD BE. TEN FORTY FORTY TEN TEN IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS MEDICATION PROCESS 40% AND OUR RESPONSE AND 10% IN A RECOVERY. IF WE ARE SPENDING AN EQUAL AMOUNT ON MITIGATION THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON RESPONSE WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET THERE AND IF WE HAVE TIME TODAY I'LL GIVE YOU SOME OF THE BACK OF THE AT BACK OF A NAPKIN NUMBERS ABOUT THE COSTS OF RECTOR FITS THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THE COST OF STAFFING TO MAKE THAT A REALITY FOR US. SO TO GET TO MY PRESENTATION -- I'VE SPENT FORTY YEARS IN THIS FIELD AT EVERY ASPECT OF THIS FROM THE GROUND LEVEL TO THE AIR LEVEL TO THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE PREVENTION MITIGATION POLICY INSURANCE. THERE IS NOT A PLACE OF THIS THAT I HAVE NOT THREE THINGS TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU TODAY. SEE WHAT'S MINE [inaudible] THE ANSWER. SO HERE ARE A US ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE COMPOSED IN THE LAND USE PLANNING WORLD. RELATIVE TO THE THINGS THAT WE DO TO ADVANCE THE DISCUSSION. YOU I DITTO VERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE HEARD HERE TODAY THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING THAT I WOULD SAY I COULD NOT STRONGLY ADVOCATE. FOR VERY FEW OF THESE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED OR EVEN STAFFED OUT FOR AND SO THE THREE THAT I'M BRINGING TO YOU TODAY ARE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LAND USE PLANNING FOR FIREFIGHTERS I STARTED TEACHING THIS COURSE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. IT HAS NOT LIFTED OFF THE GROUND YET. WHICH ONE THIS. ONE YEAH THAT'S BETTER THANK YOU. TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WE BROUGHT THE ENTIRE NAPA COUNTY BUILDING PLANNING AND CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT LAND USE PLANNERS ALTOGETHER WE SHUT DOWN ALL OF THE BUILDING AND PERMITTING DESKS FOR THE DAY AND WE BROUGHT ALL THE STAFF TOGETHER. FOR AN EIGHT HOUR TRAINING COURSE IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LAND USE PLANNING PROFESSIONALS IN THIS STATE THE BUILDING INSPECTORS THE BUILDING OFFICIALS THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHALS IN THE LAND USE PLANNING PROFESSIONALS. AND CONSULTANTS THAT WANT TO WEIGH IN ON LAND USE PLANNING. BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND AN EIGHT HOUR TRAINING COURSE THAT COURSE DOES NOT EXIST YET TODAY ALTHOUGH SEVERAL MODELS FOR THAN DO EXIST. BUT THE REQUIREMENT TO BUILD THE REQUIREMENT TO UNDERSTAND THIS RATHER THAN TRYING TO HAVE FIRE FIGHTERS WEIGH IN ON A PROFESSIONAL BODY OF KNOWLEDGE. WE NEED TO CREATE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE LAND USE PLANNING AND ASK OUR PROFESSIONALS TO ATTEND THAT AT LEAST ONE TIME IN THEIR CAREERS SO THAT THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR THEIR EXPERTISE IN LAND USE PLANNING. TO THE ISSUE AT HAND FOR THIS TYPE OF OF RISK. AND ARE AND THAT WOULD BE A RELATIVELY LOW COST WAY TO IMPLEMENT AND THEN CREATE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ACROSS THE PROFESSIONALS THAT WILL CREATE CONSISTENCY AND ALL OF THE PLANS. AND DEVELOP THE THE CONCEPT THAT YOU'RE HEARING. THANK YOU MAX I ALSO THEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT RISK AND MITIGATION ANALYSIS. WE ARE EMBARKING ON A CONVERSATION OF SHOULD WE BUILD IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE STARTING TO Q. THAT DECISION UP BEHIND THE FIRE HAZARD MAPS. EXISTING ONES OR NEW ONES THEY TELL US. A CERTAIN COMPONENT OF THIS QUESTION BUT THEY DO NOT TELL US WHAT THE RISK IS THEY WILL TELL US WHAT THE HAZARDOUS THE PROBABILITY OF THE FIRE OCCURRING AND THE RELATIVE SEVERITY OF THE FIRE ITSELF. BUT THEY DO NOT TELL US WHAT THE DAMAGES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEASURE THE MED MEDICATIONS THAT WERE ASKING US TO COMPLETE THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT THAT TOGETHER IN A SYSTEMATIC MODEL. SO WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE HERE THIS IS WHAT FIRE HAZARD JONES LOOK LIKE THEY'RE BIG THEY MAKE IT DOWN TO SMALLER ACREAGES BUT HEY'RE NOT OF THE PARCEL LEVEL AND THEY WILL NOT TELL US WHETHER WE CAN BUILD ON THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF GROUND OR NOT. WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THIS? IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY THAT OTHERS ARE STARTING TO DO THIS. I HOW DID THIS IN ANOTHER HEARING COLORADO SPRINGS IS AN EXAMPLE OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE STARTED TO DO THIS BUT ANALYZING RISK OF THE PARTIAL LEVEL WHERE WE'RE MEASURING THE MEDICATIONS THAT WERE REQUIRING. AGAINST THE HAZARD OF THE FIRE BEHAVIOR ITSELF WILL START TO TELL US IS IT BUILDABLE OR NOT BASED ON AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT PROGRAMME ACROSS THE COMMUNITY YOU START TO HAVE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE RELATIVELY LOW RISK AND THOSE THAT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. SO I BRING THAT TO YOU AS AN EXAMPLE COMMUNITY TO LOOK TOWARD -- IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DESIGN A PROGRAM LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE MITIGATION METRICS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INFORM HOMEOWNERS -- YOU'VE HEARD A FEW ABOUT SOME OF THE APPS IN OTHER. PROGRAMS THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN AT AND YOU GET DOWN TO THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS A STRUCTURE IGNITION'S ON ASSESSMENT LOOK LIKE THIS IS WHAT THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IS OUT THERE IN THE FIRE FIGHTING ARENA. AND IN THE PLANNING ARENA THAT SLOWLY STARTING TO DEVELOP WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT IT'S BECAUSE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY METRICS RISK THIS WAY THEY LOOK AT THE PARTIAL Là OF ALL. THEY LOOK AT WHAT A HOME IS LIKE THEY MEASURE IT PARTIAL BY PARCEL AND THEN THEY COSTS THAT OUT THROUGH THE RATE SETTING GUIDELINES WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. SO FOR EVERY PROPERTY IN THIS STATE THERE'S AN INSURANCE. ALGORITHM THAT IS DETERMINING RISK AND THAT IS BEHIND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE RISK STTING POLICIES AND LESS OUR PUBLIC POLICY AND OUR PUBLIC MAPPING POLICIES ALIGN WITH THE INSURANCE RISK SETTING. METHODOLOGY WE'LL HAVE A BIGGER AND BIGGER DISCONNECT. WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND IN RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO THAT YOU ADOPT BOTH THE ZONING OVERLAY WHICH COULD BE TEAR TO THE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES ON MAPS THAT'S A VERY CAPABLE TOOL FOR DOING A ZONING OVERLAY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET DOWN TO A RISK ASSESSMENT YOU NEED A MODEL. THAT EVERYONE AGREES TO SO IT'S CONSISTENTLY A FORCED ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S OF A VERY CAPABLE. CAL FIRE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPR NOTE -- YES WOULD BE VERY CAPABLE IT DEVELOPING THAT MODEL AND IT WOULD THEN IMPLEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THAT DATA WOULD MOVE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN STATE AND LOCALS AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL THAT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY. QUITE DOABLE TODAY. LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE HAD THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ORDINANCE ON THE BOOKS SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NOW I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A LECTURE MOMENT FOR ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE HAD ENFORCED DEFENSIBLE SPACE CONSISTENTLY WHERE IT WAS STATUTORILY REQUIRED SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WE WOULD NOT BE IN THE MESS WE'RE IN TODAY. WE WOULD HAVE ISSUES AND WE WOULD BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WITH LAND USE PLANNING AND SOME OTHER THINGS BUT WE WOULD HAVE GONE A LONG WAY IN ACCOMPLISHING THAT. SO STATUTORILY. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A MANDATE TO REQUIREMENTS I SUPPORT THOSE BUT IT'S THE CAPACITY BUILDING AND THEN ENABLING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS OF THAT STATUTE OR REQUIREMENT OR MANDATE. THAT WE NEED THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL WE NEED A SET OF BOOTS UP EVERY DRIVE WAY ON TWO MILLION PROPERTIES IN THIS STATE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RETROFIT. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO? HOW TO ENFORCE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT NEEDS TO BE? REQUIRED. AND WE NEED TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES FUND FOR THAT SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION IS PUT TOGETHER A THREE YEAR BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT NEED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. IF YOU ROLL IT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD YOU NEED TO HAVE A BOOT UP BOOTS UP THE DRIVEWAY FOR SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PARCELS. A YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO START TO MAKE SENSE OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT. THE RETROFIT AND THE DEFENSIBLE PEANUT BUTTER THAT ACROSS THE COUNTIES NOT NECESSARILY ADJUSTING FOR LEVEL OF PARCELS BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE TWENTY PEOPLE WORKING SIX MONTHS A YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THAT'S A HEAVY LIFT BUT THAT'S NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE LEFT WE COULD DO THAT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSE IS THE IS THE COST OF THE MOST REQUIRED RETROFITS. A ROOF THE VANCE AND THE SOFFIT TO EVE'S PLUS THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE WILL COST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU'VE HEARD FROM BOTH FEMA AND OUR CALLOW YES DIRECTOR. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS CURRENTLY IN THE BUCKET TO HELP WITH THOSE IF YOU HAVE A 25% COST YEAR WITH THE HOMEOWNERS YOU CAN GET THEIR I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION LASTLY TO JUST OFF THE PRESSES THIS MONTH'S FIREHOUSE MAGAZINE NATIONAL MAGAZINE HAS AN ARTICLE ON HOW TO TRIAGE STRUCTURES. RELATIVE TO FIRE FIGHTING TACTICS AND THEY CATEGORIZE THEM INTO. NON THREATEN STRUCTURES THOSE WITH IGNITION RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND A SAFE PLACE FOR FIREFIGHTERS IN THE EVENT OF A REFUGE. THEY HAVE THREATENED BUT DEFENSIBLE AND THEN NON. NON DEFENSIBLE STRUCTURES THIS IS HOW THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE LOOKING AT OUR PROPERTIES HOUSE BY HOUSE DURING THE FIREFIGHT WE NEED TO DO THIS UP EVERY DRIVEWAY GATHER THE DATA MAKE IT TECHNOLOGICALLY AVAILABLE TO THE FIREFIGHTERS. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE STATES AND BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM AND AND WITH THAT I THINK YOU I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT. SENATOR STERN TREEPEOPLE AS HAVING A WILDFIRE RESILIENCY PROGRAM IN YOUR AREA. AND I JUST LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THEM FOR THAT VERY GOOD. I'M GOING TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY GOOD I'LL SWITCH IT APPEARS POSE COMING STRAIGHT TO ME. AS CHAIR ANY OF THE MEMBERS MEDIA QUESTIONS. I'VE GOT A FEW BUT WE'LL SHARE OKAY WHAT I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO IS -- MAKING A PRIORITY IN MONEY RIGHT -- IN IF THE STATE WERE TO PUT. IN FORCE WHAT IS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCEABLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND PUT DOLLARS TOWARDS IT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT -- EMPIRE MARSHALL'S JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THREE YEAR PROGRAM FIVE YEAR PROGRAM WATER MAY BE -- BOTTOM LINE. HOW LONG YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE ME? SIX OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN THREE YEARS. IT'S PRETTY AGGRESSIVE JUST BEING HONEST IS THE WAY THINGS MOVE RIGHT IN THE AT RURAL COUNTIES IN URBAN COUNTIES IN JUST WAY DIFFERENT. PLANS MOVE SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS IT REALISTIC TO HAVE A TIME LINE? NO THREE YEARS IS NOT A REALISTIC GOAL LINE. IT IS A GOOD FIRST WAVE TIME. IT'S AN ASSESSMENT PERIOD I THINK IF YOU PUT YOUR BACKS TO IT IN TEN YEARS TO START TO SEE A DIFFERENCE. IN THE FIRE METRICS A LOS METRICS NO THANK YOU SO WE WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN JUST TALK ABOUT. GERMAN IF YOU DON'T MIND COMMENTING ON THAT AS WELL. I WOULD ONLY SAY FROM VENTURES PERSPECTIVE WE LITERALLY ONLY ONLY NOTIFY THOSE HOMEOWNERS AT THE EDGE -- AND WE MET WE MISSED 80% OF THE HOMEOWNERS I WERE IN THE FIRE HAZARD ZONE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T AT THE EDGE SO WE PRIORITIZE WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND FRANKLY IT LIVE LIMITED FOCUS IN WOULD THAT BE. FOR EXAMPLE WE DEBATE ME NOTICES OR YES OKAY SO WHAT DOES IT WE HAVE FORCED THE RULES ON PART OF THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE RULES -- BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE JUST THE AND IT ACTUALLY PROBABLY MORE ALSO TO AVOID TO THE PANIC FROM A LARGER GROUP OF HOMEOWNERS. BUT HAD WE REALLY ENFORCE THE RULES ACROSS EVERYBODY THAT WAS SUBJECT TO THOSE RULES WE WOULD HAVE HAD LESS DAMAGE AND ARE FAR SOUNDS BECAUSE THE FIRE JUMPED THE EDGES AND WENT INTO THE MIDDLE. SO WITH THE GRANTS THAT ARE BEING THAT ARE BEING MOVED NOW BY CAL FIRE ---THAT -- GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES CAN SECURE -- WORKING WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS FOR EXAMPLE CITIES COUNTIES FIRE DISTRICTS -- CC SIX ADDRESS. EATING ADICIONAL PENETRATION WITH IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS JEEZ WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF WE DO A MORE TARGETED APPROACH. WITH CAL FIRE NON ON THOSE GRANTS. YEAH I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WOULD HELP A LOT -- WE JUST SO YOU YOU ALL KNOW WE DID POST A FIRE IN OUR COMMUNITY THE NEXT YEAR WE DID NOTIFY EVERYBODY WE SORT OF LEARNED THAT LESSON -- BUT I'M NOT SO CERTAIN THAT A CITY LIKE OURS COULD SUSTAIN THAT ANNUAL NOTIFICATION GOING FOR WITHOUT SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES KIND THANK YOU. I THINK FROM RESEARCH STUDIES THAT. THE SIGNAL DEFENSIBLE SPACE DOES ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE IMPORTANT SO -- SO YES I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT'S ENFORCING IT -- EXPAND THE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BEYOND ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET SO THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE OUT INTO THE THE THE HINTERLAND AND AND DO SOME GOOD ISN'T SUPPORTED BY. BY THE WITH FEW STUDIES THERE ARE -- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN. DO THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PART WITHOUT THE STRUCTURE HARDENING PART THEY HAVE TO GO HAND IN HAND BECAUSE IF YOU DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE USED. YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING IN YOU SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO DO IT BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET WHAT YOU WHAT YOU. NEED TO I'M REALLY GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT AND I THINK SHE CANNOT WAIT ON THIS IN THE NORTH A FIRE STORM. IMMERSE REFINED ABOUT TWO MILES AHEAD OF THE FRONT LINES OF THE FIRE. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT WHOLE KMART SHOPPING CENTER THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES A COPY PARK AT THE PARK. IS ALMOST THREE MILES AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF GROWTH -- WITHIN A WEEK AIDS IN THE MIDDLE FLIPPING TOWN -- AND THAT'S THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE ARE SEEN -- IN WILL ASK THE CHIEF -- TO AS WELL. THE AMBER FLOW THAT WERE SEEN FROM THESE FIRES -- IS IT'S ASTRONOMICAL AS FAR AS WHAT HOW FAST THIS IS MOVING IN HOW FAR THESE NUMBERS ARE NOW FLYING -- AND PLANNING ON ROOFS MANY VEGETATION. SO I AYE GREETING REQUIRES A HARDENING YEAH AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE A BIG A BIG SIGNAL VEGETATION BEYOND A CERTAIN AMOUNT BECAUSE EMBERS CAN BE COMING FROM FAR FAR AWAY. AND MOST HOMES ACTUALLY DO BURN FROM FROM MEMBERS RIGHT AND EITHER FROM AWHILE THEN FIRE OR FROM A NEIGHBORING HOME. THAT'S BURNING SO HARDENING HARDEN THE STRUCTURES. BUT GO BACK TO TO WHAT I WAS FINDING FROM -- FROM LAND USE PLANNERS ACTUALLY LAYING THE COMMUNITY OUT DIFFERENTLY. HAS A BIG IMPACT AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE GENERALLY NOT EVEN DISCUSSING THAT AND I THINK THAT'S A AN IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THAT'S FALLING SHORT OF SAYING YOU CAN'T BUILD THERE THAT'S SAYING OKAY IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD THERE LET'S DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAT'S DO IT SMARTER SO THAT'S ACTUALLY -- FALLING SHORT OF OF THAT DIFFICULT CONVERSATION THANK YOU. KERN WHAT SORRY LOSS -- SENATOR BILL SORRY YOUR NEXT OF ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO I HAD A MEETING IN LOS GATOS SAW ON EMERGENCY SERVICES -- WITH -- PEOPLE FROM CUPERTINO LOS GATOS SIR TO THE SAN JOSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. IN THE FOOTHILLS ABOVE THOSE TOWNS AND THEIR ENOUGH FIRE SEVERE THING -- THAT'S EXISTING -- FROM THE CAL FIRE THERE IN THE WHAT THEY CALL THE RED ZONE. THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THERE'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WAS BUILT TO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO FIFTY YEARS AGO ALL UP IN THE MOUNTAINS UP THERE. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN SEVERAL FIRES AND GONE THROUGH THEIR AND THEIR THE REGROWTH -- IS QUITE THICK. UP THERE SO IT'S WE ALSO HAVE A THING CALLED THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT THERE ARE. SO WE HAVE LIKE A COMBINATION OF THINGS GOING ON SO WE HAD THIS COMMUNITY ME WE HAVE LIKE OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOW UP. AND THE THE THE THE KINDA ISSUES WERE WHAT CAN WE DO TO BEEF UP THE INSPECTIONS [inaudible] OF HOMES ROSE -- THE PUBLIC LANDS OWNED BY THE PARKS DISTRICTS. ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS -- AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY. HAD. A LOT OF HOUSING BUILT IN IT BUT IT'S IN A REALLY A HI PROBABILITY OF FIRE AREA. SO HOW DO YOU DO WITH THE THOSE KINDS OF AREAS -- THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF A PLANNING PROCESS -- SHOULD WE PUT THE STRICTER OF LAND USE REQUIREMENTS. ON THOSE AREAS OF CCAR'S -- SHOULD WE HAVE. OUR HOME INSPECTIONS OF HOME INSPECTIONS WHEN THE HOUSE IS SOLD. WHAT KIND OF THINGS CAN WE DO THE? B.. FIVE FOUR THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN -- PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IN THOSE AREAS THOSE KINDS OF AREAS. YOU KNOW THE SOUND OF YOUR FROM AREA TO AREA TALKING BUT I GREW UP IN HALF MOON BAY AND MY FIRST FIRE STATION ASSIGNMENT WAS FELT IN SO I AM. AND SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES YES YES AND YES ALL OF THE ABOVE -- ARE ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR ALL OF THE POINTS OF CONTACT WITH THAT PROPERTY. YOU KNOW THAT MAKES SENSE SO YOU KNOW IF I WERE YOU KNOW WAVING A WAND. AND I WERE CALIFORNIA AND TRYING TO DO THIS AS QUICKLY AS I. POP POSSIBLY COULD. THEN -- I WOULD PUT CONDITION SAY ALL SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS ABOUT THIS PROPERTY -- IT NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE WITH THE CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO THE ZONING OVERLAY -- AND SO I WOULDUSE THAT AS AN EMBEDDING PROCESS AND THEN I WOULD -- TAKE A LOOK AT THE POINTS OF SALE. BECAUSE THAT IS ANOTHER POINT WHERE THE PROPERTY GOES THROUGH A PROCESS I KNOW IT'S UNPOPULAR IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT IS EFFECTIVE -- AND THEN I WOULD -- I WOULD BE THOUGHT MY CONVERSATION WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE THERE ARE. A THERE ARE. LITERALLY THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND GOING UP THOSE DRIVEWAYS TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE PROPERTIES AND THERE IS -- SOME LEVERAGING OF COMMON PURPOSE INCOME AND EXPENSE OF IT COULD BE HAD IN PARTNERING WITH THE INSURANCE PROCESS AS WELL. AND AND THEN TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. THE NEED FOR INSPECTIONS I THINK THERE IS GOING TO END UP BEING A KIND OF A TWO TIERED APPROACH THERE IS AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT CAN BE DONE BY RELATIVELY. A LESS EDUCATED AND MORE COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS OF THAT ARE LIKE THE LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS FIRE WAYS COMMUNITIES THAT TALK WITH HOMEOWNERS AND THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT USE THE COMMUNITY BASED PROCESS. JUST TELL TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY AND THEN THERE'S IN ENFORCING PROCESS WITH SOMEONE WHO COMES UP THE DRIVEWAY AND RIGHT TO TICKET. IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLIED WE COULD SEPARATE THOSE IN IN IN IN AN ENABLE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITH COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS WHILE THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW SENDING SOME MONEY ASIDE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS IT BECOMES THE MANDATE THE STATE -- I KIND OF ROOM THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- SHOULD THE STATE GET INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THESE -- PUBLIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES MORE FUNDING AND SO FORTH THAT THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. GO OUT AND DO THESE -- INFORMATIONAL. INFORMATIONAL THINGS FOR HOMEOWNERS OR RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THESE AREAS. YEAH YES. AND BECAUSE IT'S THOSE COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS THAT HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE THAT ARE GOING TO HELP ENABLE THIS IN THE MOST SOCIALLY. JUST LESS DISRUPTIVE WAY POSSIBLE AND USING COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS. ARE TO CARRY THE MESSAGE OUT THERE -- BUT THROUGH AN ENABLED PROCESS YOU KNOW MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE GROUPS -- WILL HELP RATHER THAN JUST THE APPROACH OF THE ENFORCING AS THE FIRST CONTACT AND AND THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT -- SINCE IT IS TO BE MANNER. LONG TIME AGO. WHILE AGO. I ACTUALLY -- WAS A PLANNER FOR LOS GATOS. AND WE DID THE PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN. BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN WRITING THAT -- THE PUBLIC SAFETY PLANS -- WE DID -- OF BEFORE COMPUTERS SUPPORTERS CAUSES NAILS STONE AGE WHEN I WAS THERE BUT WE DID WHAT WE CALL -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS -- OVERLY RISK ASSESSMENTS. WITH WE CALLED IT MY CAR AGAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS O A FEW MEMBER THAT. YOU DO OKAY SO SO WE DID -- THOSE KINDS OF ANALYSIS AND WE THE WORSE. THE MORE TARGETED AREAS. AND THAT THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE FOCUS ON FIRST. AS THE HIGHEST RHYS AREAS IS THAT A GOOD APPROACH -- TO START WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM BY FOCUSSING ON THE HARD THE THE ONES THAT HAVE SO MUCH OVERLY RISK. THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING MORE IN AN IMMEDIATE WAY. I WOULD SAY YES IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRIAGE RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN I DO THESE RISKS OVERLAYS HAVE YOU OVERLAY MULTIPLE RECESS WHERE THE PROPHET HAD THE MOST POTENTIAL RISK ACROSS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES PRIORITIZE THEM FIRST BECAUSE YOU GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IF THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK? AND THERE WE AND THEN WE AT THE COMMUNITY MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT -- PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF INSPECTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT -- LIKE I USED TO DO WHAT WE CALL SOFT INSPECTIONS. THEN A THAT WAS INSPECTION YOU GO AND YOU COULD JEWEL THE HOMEOWNER TO DO THINGS -- MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS GOOD AT THAT. SO I WOULD I WOULD HAVE LIKED A LITTLE DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO. THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND THEN LATER. WE WOULD SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO SCHEDULE LATER A IN IT -- HARDER INSPECTION THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE REQUIREMENTS. IS THAT A GOOD APPROACH SO WE DO THE COMMUNITY INFORMATION. AND THEN WE DO THE SOFT INSPECTION AND THEN WE DO THE HARD INSPECTION. THAT PROCESS IT'S A THREE STEP YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY THE I THINK THE BEST WAY TO GET THE COMMUNITY TO TO REMOVE CHANGE BEHAVIOR. I THINK I WOULD ADD ALSO THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN INSPECTION THE PERSON YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO WANT TO SEE IF YOUR HOUSE IS A FIREMAN. YEAH RIGHT THERE WELL LIKED -- FOR THE ADD TO THIS A LITTLE SENSE OF URGENCY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED LAST COUPLE YEARS I THINK THERE'S A MORE COMMON SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THOSE HOMEOWNERS THAT. SURVIVED THE FIRE MIGHT BE MORE PRONE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR HOME TO HARDEN HOME TODAY AS A NO WITH THE ALTERNATIVE IS IF THEY DON'T DO THAT. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE PLANNERS TO LEARN HELPING SKILLS TO JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW AND ON THE ON RATHER JUST BEING REGULATORS YEAH. IT'S IMPORTANT AS PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR THE PLANNERS TO THAT HELPING. THE POINT BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN THE OTHER THE OTHER -- THE LAST ISSUE I WANNA RAISES. SIR OF FUNDING AND WHAT WOULD BE THE PRIORITY OF FUNDING AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS WOULD YOU SAY. YOU MENTION -- ONE ASPECT YOU HAVE EITHER THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO RIGHT AWAY KIND OF KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. THE DANGER DID THE DANGER AND ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE PRIORITY BEGS THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR RIGHT OKAY SO -- SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. DEVELOPING THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE. IT'S RELATIVELY LOW COST TO PUT THE LAND USE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS IN STATURE STATUTORY LAW AND CODIFY THEM THAT'S A LOW COST SO THAT COULD BE DONE LITERALLY THIS SESSION. AND THEN APPROACHING THE ONCE AGAIN KIND OF EDUCATING THAT THOSE PROFESSIONALS OUT THERE SO THEY KNOW HOW TO QUICKLY APPLY THOSE LAWS. AND THEN I WOULD SAY GOING BACK TO THIS RETROFIT THE HARDENED COMMUNITY OR RESILIENT COMMUNITY IS BUILT ON THIS -- THIS REQUIREMENT THIS NEED THAT WE HAVE FOR THE RETROFIT OF BOTH THE BUILDING AND THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THAT. WHICH IS NOT GONNA MAKE MUCH PROGRESS ON THE FIRE LOSSES INTO WE GO THROUGH. THE ENFORCEMENT AND THE ENABLING A BOTH RETROFITTING DEFENSIBLE SPACE TO JUST HAVE A WARNING THESE -- NICE WAYS OF DOING THINGS WHAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED IN WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AND AN AFTERMATH REPORTS ON BIG FIRES AND IN THE MOUNTAINS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE FOUND THAT -- OVER 50% OF THE DWELLINGS BURN HAD NO BUILDING PERMITS WHATSOEVER. OKAY SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF STRUCTURES THAT ARE. NOT PERMITTED AND THAT GOES FOR WIRE RINGING -- THE STRUCTURAL PERMITS OR ANY KIND OF PERMITS SAID NO PERMITS WHATSOEVER. AND THAT IS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM ALSO. THAT REQUIRES MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THE KIND OF THE PLANNING -- PROCESS. SOFT -- SHARKS INSPECTION HARD INSPECTION IF WE COULD GO IN AND IN MAY BE. SCREEN AND REMOVE SOMEHOW ILLEGAL STRUCTURES AND WIRING. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE A QUICK FIX DO YOU DO YOU AGREE WITH THE WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M NOT SURE I WOULD. CALL IT A QUICK FIX JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD REDUCE RISKS AS WHAT I'M SAYING. BUT OVERALL THE THEN CARE THE ILLEGAL STUFF THE AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE TO THAT SORT OF QUICK FIX WOULD MAKE THE QUICK FIX NOT SO QUICK I THINK. MY SENSE IS THE MORE THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY MAKE THIS AN URGENT MATTER AND AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR HARDENING HOMES AND DEALING WITH. DEFENSIBLE SPACE TO PROTECT THE HOME NOT BEEN BURNED BY THE FIRE THAT'S THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK GONE FOR THE NIGHT MY APPROACH WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU GOT A REALLY. SEVERE WRIST AREA. AND YOU HAVE SOME. BUILDINGS THAT HAD ILLEGAL WIRING AND ALL KINDS OF HAZARDOUS KIND OF BASICALLY HAZARDOUS [inaudible] SITUATIONS. YOU CAN'T JUST. WAIT FOR THAT TO GET BETTER YOU HAVE. TO RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO GO ON DEALWITH A I MEAN OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST WAITING FOR AN EXPLOSION TO OCCUR BASICALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK AND ADDRESS SENATOR MAGUIRE'S OPENING COMMENTS TOM. WELL I'M HERE ADVOCATING -- FOR FOR THESE THINGS -- AS A GROUP WE ARE I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT. THE RESPOND ORDERS YOU KNOW THE FIREFIGHTING FORCES CRITICAL THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT GOING. TO REDUCE THE FIRE IN THE FIRE OCCURRENCE ON OUR COMMUNITY ALL OF THIS IS DESIGNED THE BUILDING THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING STANDARDS A DEFENSIBLE SPACE. ARE DESIGNED SO THAT WE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF HOUSES THAT ARE STARTING TO IGNITE AND OVERWHELMING THE FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS. IS GET THE FIRE IGNITIONS OF THE STRUCTURES DOWN TO A POINT WHERE THE FIREFIGHTERS CAN THEN HANDLE THOSE. AND IT IS THE COMBINATION REPARATION IN THE MILITARY TRIMS ITS CALLED SHAPING THE BATTLEFIELD YOU GET THE THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND SUFFICIENT SO THAT THE RESPONSE FORCE. CAN EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH IT -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO MITIGATE OUR% WAY OUT OF THE RESPONSE REQUIREMENT BUT WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO SUCCEED. THANK YOU -- BEFORE I MOVE ON JUST. MAYBE SOMEONE YOU ALL COULD GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON NOT NECESSARILY YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY BUT WANTED FEEDBACK ON THE COMMUNITY WILD FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT THAT CAL FIRE JUST RELEASED. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND. PRIORIDAD SORT OF THIRTY FIVE HIGH PRIORITY FUEL MITIGATION PROJECTS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED JUST TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THE METHODOLOGY USED -- IT IT MOSTLY TARGET SAY RESPONSIBILITY AREAS -- AS WELL AS WITHIN SOME OF THE CONTRACT COUNTIES BUT THE VALUE -- WHAT THE BASIC A BIG TREES ANSWER THIS WILD LAND ISSUE IT'S IT'S HEAVILY WEIGHTED THERE JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY IN PLACE AND SHOVEL READY BUT I SORT OF WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU ALL JUST -- THE BALANCE ON THIS SORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY VERSES BROADER -- JUST TO MITIGATE FUEL LOAD WRIT LARGE. AND QUESTION AND THEN THE OTHER FEEDBACK WE LOVE FROM YOU ALL IS ON THE THIRTY MILLION I BELIEVE IS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATIONS STAGES -- AUTHORIZED -- ON THIS SORT OF LOCAL OUTREACH COMPONENT YOUR TO THAT YOU ALL OF ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- AND BEST PRACTICES THERE -- WE WE HEARD IT FROM -- CALLOW YESTERDAY ABOUT A BIG NEED FOR BIG PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN -- BEST PRACTICES WHO WHO'S DONE IT WELL WHAT P. OURS WORKED HOW MUCH OF IT IS JUST DIGITAL BUZZ IS IT ABOUT YOU KNOW. SOME CELEBRITY PUTTING SOMETHING ON THERE INSTEAD THE COUNCIL'S ACTUALLY GOOUT AND KNOCK ON DOORS IT MAY ACTUALLY BE A STRANGE MIX OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OUT THERE TO GET THIS ON THE FRONT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS SAID THAT. THERE'S A CULTURAL MOVED TO GO THERE SO WE DO WE LOVE SOME INPUT THERE AS WELL -- AS PROBABLY MORE FUNDING IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD SO -- AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE JUST FOR POTENTIAL FOLLOW UP HERE IS -- ON THE DATA SAID THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS -- ON OUR HOMES SEEMS TO BE THE MOST GRANULAR DETAIL DATA SAID. THAT IS PRIVATELY HELD -- THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THAT. HOW WHAT IS THAT INTERFACE LOOK LIKE YOU SAID DR MORE ENGAGING WITH THE -- WHY -- WOULD LOVE SOME FEEDBACK THERE ABOUT WHAT'S A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO KIND OF SHORT CUT TO THAT DATA IT MAY BE THROUGH COLLECTION DOOR TO DOOR. BUT IF IT IF THIS DATA SAID ALREADY EXISTS -- I MEAN WE COULD BUY. RIGHT SO -- AND SORRY I SAID THAT WAS THE LAST ONE BUT EXAMPLES OF STRONGER JUST BEST PRACTICES ALLEN ON PLANNING LIKE WE WERE WHO'S DOING THIS WELL -- IT WOULD REALLY HELP US YOU KNOW WE SHOULD IT WOULD FROM A SHOULD HAVE A PR HERE TODAY AND WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT BUT REALLY HOW TO START TO INTEGRATE SOME OF THE BEST LAND USE PLANNING OUT THERE INTO THE OPR GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BE VERY HELPFUL. SO -- YES SO SORRY WE KEEP WE'VE WE'VE HEARD AUSTRALIA ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS IS REALLY THE ONLY ANALOGY THAT WORKS OUT IN THE WORLD FOR FOR IT YOU KNOW NATION THAT'S HAD THAT KIND A SEVERITY. OF RISK -- SO MAYBE WE CAN DRILL DOWN A BIT MORE THERE AND I KNOW TREAT PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER BY THE WAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT PLUG. ANYHOW THIRTY QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS BUT IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT -- SOME WRITTEN FEEDBACK THAT BE AWESOME LET'S KEEP THIS ROLE AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT A BIG FINAL PANEL WITH A LOT OF HEAVY HITTERS HERE -- SO -- INCLUDING THE ANOTHER -- I STEAM THE RETIREE WHO WE HAVE NOT LET OUT OF SERVICE YET THANK YOU AGAIN CHIEF JARGON -- BUT CHIEF PIMLOTT -- WELCOME BACK -- SO WE HAVE DIRECTOR PAM ON HERE -- WITH CAL FIRE. AS WELL AS SCOTT LAUDER -- FORMER MAYOR FROM THE TOWN OF PARADISE -- TIM SNELLING IS DIRECTOR OF BUTTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES -- CHIEF MIKE MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN FROM THE CONSUMERS COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT FIRE DEPARTMENT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FUTURE WE'RE GRATEFUL TO EACH OF OUR PANELISTS INTO OUR PREVIOUS PANEL REALLY WONDERFUL FEEDBACK IN THE FOUR TO WORKING WITH YOU HERE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. WE HAVE HEARD FROM -- THE STATE FARMER FEMA AND STATE -- YES ON WHAT WE NEED TO BE TO DO BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO RECOVERY RESPONSE AND REBUILD WE JUST HEARD FROM -- PLANNING TEAM AND NOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO REGULATE DEVELOPMENT DO MORE TO REGULATE DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE AREAS WE WANT TAKE MOMENT. TO TALK ABOUT OUR LEAD OFF AND THAT IS AT CHIEF HIM WHAT -- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR HIS SERVICE AT TO THE STATE OVER THIRTY YEARS -- AND HE HAS MANY MANY MORE DECADES TO BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT HE IS DECIDED TO BE ABLE. TO GET BACK HERE TODAY HE'S REALLY THRILLED ABOUT THAT BY THE WAY -- AND HE'S ABOUT TO START BUILDING A HOUSE WHICH IS PRETTY EXCITING -- BUT CHIEF -- AND ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEES WE JUST WANTED MOMENT SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR MASON SERVICE THIS STATE -- YOU ARE THINK THE ONLY ONE IN THIS NATION THAT HAS SEEN THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR CAREER CHANGE. AS SEVERE AS A I AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THAT HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES LIKE YOU. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU CHOSE TO PICK CALIFORNIA. AS TO YOUR CAREER A GREAT THE CITY STATE ON REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. MISTER CHIEF THE FOUR DOORS GOOD AFTERNOON. AREA REGULAR RATE WELL GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRS MCGUIRE AND STERN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BY SYNDICATED CAN TIM WATER RETIRED -- DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE. AND YES I HAVE BEEN A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE. IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS SEEN -- SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LANDSCAPE BOTH IN WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ALMOST FORTY MILLION NOW -- AS WELL AS THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE FACING -- EVERY DAY. BOTTOM LINE IS -- EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE TODAY -- HAS REALLY BEEN SPOT ON I CAN'T. WITH BABY LITTLE EXCEPTION TAKE -- ISSUE WITH ALL OF THE SUBJECT MATTER THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT -- WERE CHALLENGED WITH EVERY DAY IN THE STATE. ON THE CIRCLE BACK SINCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN FACING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING -- AND THEN DOVE DEEP INTO SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND MEDICATIONS BUT RE CERTAINLY BACK TO NOT FORGETTING. THAT JUST WITHIN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN THE MOST DEADLY. THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. JUST IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN IF YOU LOOK AT FIVE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SKIN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. WE'VE HAD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE. OUR AND AT THE DEADLIEST FIRES ARE AND IN. THE LAST TOP TEN OF THE OF THE TWENTY HAVE OCCURRED JUST IN THE LAST DECADE SO EVERYTHING IS TRENDING TOWARDS A MORE COMPLEX MORE CHALLENGING. SITUATION AND CALIFORNIA HAS LONG KNOWN FIRE CHALLENGES IN THE WILDLAND FIRE MARM YOU GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BELLAIRE FIRE IN. LOS ANGELES CITY YOU CAN GO TO THE COUNTY IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOR A TEN DAY CATASTROPHIC EVENT IN THE STATE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FROM THE OAKLAND HILLS ALRIGHT HUMBOLDT COUNTY OAKLAND HILLS ALL WE SOUTH INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND AGAIN IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIVE AND OF COURSE THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN USING OF SUFFERING FROM THE IMPACTS OF CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT AND QUITE FRANKLY YES THE IMPACTS OF OF A CHANGING CLIMATE WHERE WE'RE SEEING OVERALL I MEAN% TEMPERATURE INCREASE ACROSS THE STATE -- AND WE'RE LOOKING AT CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERNS WERE LOOKING AT CHANGES IN WHERE VEGETATION GROWS WRIST LITERALLY AND REALLY AN OVER SIMPLIFIED APPROACH WERE SEEING THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRE ENVIRONMENT MOVE NORTH. IN LATITUDE IN RACING VEGETATION MOVE UP. IN ELEVATION -- IN TERMS OF VEGETATION THAT'S VERY CONDUCIVE. TO THIS -- FIRES CYCLE IT'S MORE FREQUENT AND MORE DEVASTATING. WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IN THESE FIRES JUST WE'VE HAD DEVASTATING FIRES WE'VE HAD SEEN AND WIND DRIVEN WE'VE HAD? THE THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE -- IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES -- BUT THE WHAT'S DIFFERENT -- BURNING WITH JUST INTENSE RATES OF SPREAD YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILES IN ONE AFTERNOON FOR ALSO LASTING LONGER THEIR BIKES POSING FIREFIGHTERS AND THE PUBLIC AND COMMUNITIES TO RISK. FOR IN THE CASE OF THIS LAST SUMMER SIX WEEKS OR MORE WE FIGURED THE BETWEEN THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX. AND THE CAR FIRE BOTH OF THOSE FIRES WERE VERY LONG DURATION THE THOMAS FIRE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LONGEST RECORDED RED FLAG WARNING. THAT I'M AWARE OF THIRTEEN DAYS STRAIGHT OF EXTREMELY LOW HUMIDITY THESE WIND ARE PRODUCED JUST CONDITIONS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY RIGHT. FOR MULTIPLE FIRES AND CATASTROPHIC FIRE. SO THE CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN THE STATE AND BEING PART OF IT BUT ALSO WATCHING WHERE THINGS ARE GOING -- AS THE STATE IS RELEASED ITS FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT OBVIOUSLY VERY AGGRESSIVE LOOK. AT THAT SOME VERY TARGETED THINGS BUT IT'S THE CAN TO THE INVESTMENT THE STATE CONTINUES TO MAKE. OUR IN THESE KEY AREAS NOW ARE AT IS DOCTOR MORRIS SAID THERE YOU YOU HAVE THE FORCED. WOW MAN ENVIRONMENT AND YOU HAVE THIS URBAN FACED ENVIRONMENT WHILE THEY ARE CAN BE DISTINCTLY SEPARATE I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY WERE OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE OFTEN WHERE THEIR OVERLAPPING BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST. A COMMUNITY OR SUBDIVISION PLOPPED -- IT IN AN URBAN AREA NEXT TO THE WHILE AND WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT. THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS OF THAT OUR INNER MIX TO THE SO COORDINATING THESE ACTIVITIES AND REDUCING FUEL LOADINGS USING PRESCRIBED FIRE LOSING ALL THESE TOOLS. CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON HELPING PROTECT COMMUNITIES OR STRUCTURES THAT MAY BE WITHIN. THE AREA BEING TREATED ABSOLUTELY THE WIND DRIVEN FIRES THAT WE'RE SEEING -- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT EIGHTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS? BLOWING THROUGH CANYONS VERY LITTLE CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE THAT KIND OF INTENSITY WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE OCCURRING AND THAT'S WHY. EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. IT'S SORT OF A WHOLE OF COMMUNITY AS YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT'S THAT IN. HOLISTIC APPROACH IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY TREATING VEGETATION IN STRATEGIC PLACES AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES. DEFENSIBLE SPACE ALL OF THAT HARDENING THE COMMUNITIES IN AND I KNOW THE QUESTIONS GOING TO COME LATER ALL DON'T THROW A LITTLE BIT OF IT OUT NOW AND WE CAN TALK MORE. BUT THE IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO SHOULD WE BE MANDATING OR SHOULD WE BE. ENCOURAGING THROUGH -- INCENTIVES AND I I THINK WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS THAT IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION OF BOTH AND I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS. IS THAT. AS OF FIRE MARSHAL MIKE RICH WINE TALKED ABOUT THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOON. IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE STATE CAME OUT OF THE FIRES -- YEAR THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE IN THE EARLY NINETIES BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW WAS WHILE NGUYEN VEGETATION IN AN URBAN AREA. ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION AND REMEMBER SOT TO PARTNER FOR YOU SAW THINGS THAT WERE DRIVING FIRE CONDITIONS. OUR GREAT LARGE APPROACH TO LOOKING IN IDENTIFYING FIRE HAZARD BUT WHAT CAN I THINK CHIEF JARGON REALLY HIT IT IT'S WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DOWN TO THE PARCEL LEVEL WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL HOUSE AN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL STRUCTURE AND SAY. CAN I MITIGATE THE RISK OF FIRE LIFE LOSS OF LIFE ON THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY. BASED ON WHERE I WANT TO PUT THAT STRUCTURE LOCATED NEXT TO A CANYON THAT THE VEGETATION THE PREVAILING WIND PATTERNS ALL OF THOSE THINGS INGRESS EGRESS ALL THE THINGS YOU FOR TODAY. ALL THOSE EVALUATIONS NEED TO OCCUR AND IF WE CAN'T GET TO THAT PLACE THE NOSE OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT ARE HARD ABOUT NOT MAYBE. PUTTING A HOME THERE WHAT. I DON'T WANT TO BE. BUT LITERALLY WATER CORRECT IS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE THAT QUOTED. ME OUT OF CONTEXT SAYING THAT THE CHIEF WANTS TO BAN BUILDING IN THE WILD MANNER INTERFACE. SENATE MCGUIRE SAID I'M BUILDING A HOUSE IN THE URBAN INTERFACE I KNOW TRUE WELL. THE IMPACTS ON THE CHALLENGES BUT WE HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. MITIGATE THOSE RISKS AND THAT'S GONNA BE A COMBINATION OF A CARROT. AND A STICK AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE END OF THE DAY WHERE WE NEED TO GET -- TO IS CONTINUING TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AS TO HOW WE IMPLEMENT ALL OF THAT. TO GET TO THAT IN STATE AND IT'S THE LEGACY CONSTRUCTION THE THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS THERE PRIOR. TO THE STATE'S VERY AGGRESSIVE URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING CODES THAT HAS ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES IT'S THIS ORDER CONSTRUCTION THAT IS YOU'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT. THIS MORNING IS CONTINUING TO BE OUR CHALLENGE IN ONE MINUTE THAT. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SEE TO THE REST OF MY TIME I KNOW WE'VE GOT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUESTIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO ADMIT PANELS TO THANK YOU. I SHOP TO THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY FOR YOU HERE WILL BECOME BACK QUESTIONS WERE IN TURN OVER TO MR LOTTERIES THE FORMER MAYOR TOWN OF PARADISE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE MISS MAYOR. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU WE'RE GOING TO THE FLOOR FOR OKAY -- GIVE MY NAME SCOTT WATER -- I WAS -- COUNCILMEMBER IN PARADISE FOR OVER SIXTEEN YEARS SAID A BUSINESS OWNER ON A MOVIE THEATER IN PARADISE -- ALSO OVER IN LAKE COUNTY HAVE A COUPLE BUSINESSES. THERE I SPENT FOURTEEN YEARS ON LAUGH CO -- SO IN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAND USE AND PLANNING AND ALSO -- FOURTEEN YEARS ON THE LEAGUE CITY SET PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY COMMITTEE SETS NEAR AND DEAR TO ME -- ALSO FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I'M VERY PROUD OF MY SON IN LAW WHOSE -- CAL FIRE ENGINEER AND YON PHIL SO -- MY MY NOSE GET OUT OF BED BUT ABOUT THIS -- MY HOME BURNED IN THE WILL PROPERTIES MY AND AND AND IT OF A MY HOW ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD -- BUILT OF THOSE FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS -- STUCCO HARDY PLANK -- MY DECK WAS CONCRETE AND STEEL IT'S STILL STANDING -- OF THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE I LIVED ON THE EDGE OF THE EDGE OF THE CANYON ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY LIMITS -- WE'RE TRULY IT MEETS TO BE ALONE BLM LAND -- BUT THE FIRE CAME FROM WITHIN THE CITY EIGHT EIGHT CAME DOWN MY DRIVEWAY. ACCORDING TO THE NEIGHBORS -- AND ANDYOU TALK ABOUT THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THOSE OF US THAT LIVE ON THE CANYON WE LIVE ON THE EDGE WE'VE BEEN VERY VIGILANT. PEOPLE WITHIN THE TOWN. NOT SO MUCH AND THAT'S A THAT'S A CHALLENGE -- MIGHT WERE MY DAUGHTER WAS WHEN I WAS LISTEN THE SCANNER THE FIRE IT'S SPOTTED OVER. HAD MOVED -- FROM POLKA. NINE MILES AND THEN WAS BURNING THE EDGE OF TOWN BUT WAS BURNING FARTHER INTERIOR. OF THE CITY -- LONG BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE IS BRING SO WE STARTED BURNING ON THE EDGES AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN ON THE END OF THE FOR THE SAGES SO. OF LOTS OF CHALLENGES AND WE WERE HAD MY I LAID OUT MY FIRE HOSES -- AROUND THE HOUSE SO IF SOMEBODY GIVE FIRE ENGINES CAME SOMEBODY CAME SAVE IT -- THEY COULD TRY TO DO IT THE CHALLENGES OF EVACUATIONS YOU'RE STUCK IN TRAFFIC. FOR HOURS AND THE PROBLEM WASN'T OUR TRAFFIC IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE. IT WAS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM SKY WAY FIFTEEN MILES. AWAY AT HIGHWAY NINETY NINE WHERE THEY WEREN'T PREPARED FOR HAVING. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY THOUSAND VEHICLES SOME ARE MAYOR WHO'S A FORGE FORMER CALTRANS DISTRICT DIRECTOR KNOWS A BIT ABOUT TRAFFIC MOVEMENT SHE SAYS THERE'S NO PHYSICAL WAY. THAT YOU COULD MOVE THAT MANY VEHICLES ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGES STREET THAT WE HAVE IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAD. THE JUST NO WAY TO DO IT -- THEY HAVE BEEN ADDED THE UPPER REACHES SCAPE ROUTE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AFTER THE HUMBLE COMPLEX FIRES -- THAT HELPED A GREAT DEAL. BUT WE WE HAD THAT WE USE CONTRA FLOW. ALL LANES WHAT WAS NORMALLY COMING INTO TOWN AND TWO LANES GOING OUT OF TOWN BECAME SIX LANES GOING OUT OF TOWN. BUT YOU WERE HAVING TO DODGE FIRST RESPONDERS TRYING TO GET INTO TOWN TO IS WE HAD A LIMITED -- WORK CAL FIRE -- CONTRACTS CITY -- THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB -- WE HAD EXCELLENT RESPONSE BUT IT WAS -- TRULY AB CHALLENGING UP SOME OF THE TAKE WASTE JUST QUICKLY -- AN ADVANCED RAPID WARNING SYSTEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED -- BEEN OUR WE WE COMMUNITIES. AND INCIDENTLY ALL THE REBUILD IN PARADISE HALF TO MEET WILLIE STANDARDS EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SPRINKLER -- THEY HAVE TO BE THAT NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS -- SO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT I VERIFIED THAT THIS MORNING WITH THE TOWN MANAGER BUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE -- AS A DATE THE ADVANCE RAPID WARNING SYSTEMS -- WE HAVE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE IN THE WET SEASON TO BE ABLE TO USE -- CONTROLLED BURNS ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE. WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S -- THAT THE KIND OF CONTROL OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT AND AND WE NEED TO STAFF CAL FIRE YEAR ROUND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR TEAMS WORKING ON THAT STUFF REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FULL TIME THING. AND THEN. THE OTHER THING WE FOUND IT WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK MORE AT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. IS A BUILDER AT BILL THAT HE TO SHELTER IN PLACE -- CROSS FOR MY MOVIE THEATER TO KMART PARKING LOT -- SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED VEHICLES SHELTERED IN PLACE THERE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET OUT BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS THE SAFEST PLACE FOR THEM TO BE. CAL FIRE WAS THERE AND THEN WHEN IT WAS WHEN THE TRAFFIC IT LET UP THEN THEY LET THEM OUT OF TOWN. AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE -- THE STRUCTURES ARE SUCH THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BURN. AND AND THAT WE CAN SHELTER RE EMPLOYED SURE OFF AND THEN ALLOW THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO DO THEIR JOB -- BECAUSE ALL OF THEM THAT ARE IN TOWN THAT DAY WERE. ONLY WORRIED ABOUT LIFE SAFETY GETTING PEOPLE OUT THEY WEREN'T FIGHTING THE STRUCTURE FIRES AT THAT POINT IT WAS JUST GETTING PEOPLE OUT ONE MINUTE. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY P. JEANNIE -- HAS THE IN THEIR IN THEIR REBUILD PROCESS -- IS USING SOMETHING THEY CALL TREE RATED WIRING. AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING A LOT OF THESE FIRES SEEM TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO PGA OR THE UTILITIES AND AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IS SPENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PUTTING IN. TREE RATED WIRING P. JEANNIE HAD NOT BEEN DOING THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW IN PARADISE BUT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF THAT -- THAT WIRING. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN ALSO THINGS LIKE A HIGH IMPEDANCE ARC FAULT INTERRUPTERS -- WHICH CAN STOP THINGS FROM SPREADING -- AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE LET'S LET'S STOP THE IGNITION -- BUT LOTS OF BUG. REALLY INTERESTING WELL INFORMED COMMENTS HERE TODAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR AND WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU EVEN SHARE YOUR STORY TAKES TIME TO BEAR TO BE HERE AND ALSO LEARN THE LESSONS THAT YOU SEEN ON THE GROUND. I LIVE IN THROUGH THAT HELL THAT WAS -- FIRE. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT MR SMELLING HIS HERE HE'S ATTRACTED THE BUTTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WAS SELLING THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI YOU ARE IN THE THICK OF IT AT THE MOMENT IN REGARDS TO THE REBUILD. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES IN WILL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROMPT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. SOME GREAT TO BE HERE AS WELL. WE ENJOYED LEARNING HOW FROM SO MANY SPEAKERS THIS MORNING HAPPENING HERE WE'RE ALL GONNA GO ON A FIELD TRIP TO AUSTRALIA EIJI WAS SEE THINGS OVER THERE. THAT WAS GOOD NEWS. I THINK THE THE QUESTION I CAME PREPARED ANSWERS SO SHOULD THE STATE DO MORE TO REGULATE DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. AND I THINK I CAN TELL YOU FROM RURAL CALIFORNIA GENERALLY THE ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE THE STATE -- MANDATES ARE NOT WELCOME BUT% INCENTIVES IN A I THINK THERE ARE AND WE RECOGNIZE NAY GREEN WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID REALLY IT'S GONNA BE A COMBINATION OF BOTH SOME INCENTIVES AND MANDATES. AND MY BACKGROUND IS I'M. OVERSEE PLANNING BUILDING AND OF ARMED SERVICES SO ALL OF THE PLANNING BUILDING IN COULD FORSMAN. AT ALL OF THESE SERVICES ARE RELATED TO LAND USE IN SO WE'RE WE'RE INVOLVED WITH PLANNING TO THE JOURNAL PLANS ONLY PROCESS. IN AND WE'RE INVOLVED WITH TEACHING BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED ACTUALLY GET BUILT WITH THINGS DON'T GO WELL WERE INVOLVED CODE ENFORCEMENT TO SEE THINGS GET REPAIRED SO WE'RE ALL OF ONE STOP SHOP. I HAD FOUR DIFFERENT AREAS I WAS GOING TO COMMENT ON THE LEGACY COMMUNITIES THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED PRETTY WELL BY A LOT OF THE SPEAKERS. HI YOU KNOW. FOR ME THE LONG DEAD -- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES IS -- YOU KNOW THESE FIRE TRAPS ARE SERIOUS ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN OUR LEGACY COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR EVEN COVERS GUTTER COVERS -- LANDSCAPE REPLACING WOODEN DECKS ALREADY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MY RECOMMENDATION IS LIKE YOU FOR BEFORE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AND ALSO YOU KNOW WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE PROGRAMS WERE PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN VIDEO INSPECTIONS OF THEIR HOMES -- THAT GETS FORWARDED ON YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY THAT BECOMES PART OF YOUR RECORD FOR SHOWING YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE YOUR YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO CATCHER -- AND GUTTERS COVERED YOU CUT EVEN COVERS -- YOU WEN YOU REPLACE WOOD DECKS I MEAN ALL THOSE THINGS COULD BE VERIFIED THERE ARE THERE WE GOT TO BE THINKING MORE CREATIVELY I THINK. THEY'RE JUST GOING OUT TO EVERY HOUSE AND KNOCKED ON EVERY DOOR I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS TO USE SO LET'S PUT HIM TO USE. ANOTHER IDEA WAS TO HAVE SOMETHING KIND OF LIKE A A NATIONAL FIRE INSURANCE PROGRAM. SIMILAR TO NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT BUT I'VE MY FIRE FOLKS TELL ME THAT GAINES LIVE IN THE WE WE IN THAT PUTS US ON THE SCALE I THINK OF OF A FLOOD THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE. TYPE OF PROGRAM THE OTHER IDEA WOULD BE IT'S TAX SEASON. NO SIR TAX CREDIT POSSIBILITIES SIMILAR LIKE WE DO A SOLAR -- FOR SOME OF THESE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE SOMETHING. TO TAKE A LOOK AT NEXT THERE IS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE AREAS [inaudible] I AM. YOU KNOW THIS THIS FIRE THAT WE HAD THIS THIS WAS A WILDLAND FIRE. THAT BECAME AN URBAN FIRE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH HIS COFFEE PARKER PARADISE IN THE COUNTY. I YOU KNOW YOU HEARD THE EMBERS JUMPING FIVE MILES IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRESSION MAP OF THE FIRE WRITTEN IN RAM PARADISE IT'S SWALLOWED PARADISE FROM BOTH SIDES. AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST THING THING TO LOOK AT IN THE PROGRESSION -- BUT THESE ARE ANGRY FIRES AND IT TAKES IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I'M SURE AND MORE. AND I DON'T KNOW THE WE CAN STOP THE FIRES -- I THINK YOU DO WHEN THE FIRE COMES. THAT'S A SOBERING THOUGHT TO THINK ABOUT. I KNOW THIS FIRE I HAD A VERY -- POINT COUNTERPOINT CONVERSATIONS WHEN MY FIREMAN I SAID WHY DID YOU GUYS JUST NOT THIS DOWN FROM THE AIR RIGHT WHEN IT HAPPENED. AND YET SIX THREE MORNING. SAID THE WINDS WERE SO HIGH THE SMOKE WAS SO THICK THEY COULD NOT GET IN THERE. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS WELL DON'T YOU HAVE A SUPER DUPER PLAYING THE CAN GET AND YOU KNOW HIM. SO ANYWAY -- IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING BUT THE REAL. OF THE FIRST TEN HOURS OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS ESSENTIALLY A LIFE RESCUE EVENT ALSO I THINK THERE'S A LOSING THAT THE THEY'RE FIGHTING THE FIRE THERE ARE FIGHTING THE FIRE THEIR THIEVING FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR THE FIRST TEN HOURS IN PARADISE IN IN THE COUNTY. A PARADISE I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE TOWN MANAGER ALSO AND WHEN. THINGS PRETTY BROAD STILL IN IN OUR AREA BUT I I ASK A QUESTION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ARE YOU GONNA REPLANT OR JUST REBUILD. AND THE INSTINCT TO THE IN LOVE WITH IS TO REBUILD. GET IN THE PEOPLE GET BACK ON THE PROPERTY YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE AS A YEAR MORE TO CLEAN UP THE PROPERTIES. SO NOW TO THEIR CREDIT THE TOWN IS UNDERTAKING A PROCESS CALLED MAKE IT PARADISE. ADULT. IN THAT CITY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO LOOK TO RE PLAN. ARE THE TOWN IN MAKING A FIRE RESILIENT CAM SERVED UP TO YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THE TARA PARADISE BECOME THE MODEL FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. UP YOU CARRY RECOVERS DOT ORG IS ALSO WEBSITE THAT'S GOT A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION. ONE MINUTE OKAY. I GOTTA GET INTO LAND USE PLANNING LAWS -- SB TWELVE FORTY ONE WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE EARLIER IN UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY NINE ALSO WE HAVE -- REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AN ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. ALSO THE LOCAL HAS MITIGATION PLANS A CONNECTION WITH THE SAFETY ON THE TO THE BOTTOM LINE THERE IS THAT WE NEED TO CONNECT. WITH OUR SAFETY ELEMENTS ARE GENERAL PLANTS AND GET SOME REAL ACTION ITEMS OUT OF OUR GENERAL PLANTS THAT GET SPECIFIC WITH WHAT THE TARGETED ISSUES ARE IN OUR JURISDICTIONS. IN I THINK THE REALITY TO DO THAT IS WE NEED SOME FUNDING NEED SOME GRANT FUNDING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO CONNECTING LH MPS GENERAL PLANS SB. THREE SEVENTY NINE AND FRANKLY WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO THROW IN THE U. S. B. ONE THOUSAND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WHILE READY BECAUSE WE GOT TO DO THAT ANYWAY WOULD WORK. ADJUSTING ARSENAL PLANS AND GET THAT ALL FIXED. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION SEQUEL. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BROUGHT UP WHAT'S TODAY I'M SHOCKED -- BUT A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR SEQUEL COULD BE SO ACTUALLY IT'S FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH SEEK BAR ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS FOR FEW REDUCTION PROJECTS. AND WE SHOULD COME UP WITH STANDARDS THROUGH THE REGISTER PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS BORE FORESTRY OTHER PROPERTY AGENCIES SO THAT WE CAN CARVE OUT OF SEQUENCE ACTION FOR THEM TO GET IN THERE DO THESE. TWO REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT. VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO GET SEWER -- IN THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PARADISE -- SO NO DATA. CENTER NIELSEN SOONER INNOCENTLY GALLAGHER IS WORKING HARD ON THAT AS WELL WITH THAT JENNIFER INTO WHICH WOULD MAKE ALL OF YOU THAT CAME UP IN VISIT PARADISE TWO NIGHTS GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A REALLY GREAT FOR FREE HEARING YOU. FOR YOUR INSIGHT. WE NOW LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CHIEF MICHAEL OFTEN IS WITH THE CONCERN THIS AT COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT. BUT THEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR YOUR TIME THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WILL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THERE IS A MEASURE THAT MICHAEL GLADDEN THE FIRE CHIEF WE CONSUME ISN'T IN ELK GROVE -- SPECIFICALLY SITTING BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- BOTH CENTER STERN AND DAN S. OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS THAT THAT AFFECT OUR GREAT STATE -- THAT -- AS IS AS WE MOVE IN THERE'S BEEN MANY GREAT THINGS PROPER FOR YOU TODAY FROM TEACH WHICH WIND SPEAKING THIS MORNING OF THE THE BUILDING CODES IN THE BUILDING STANDARDS THAT EXIST. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THROUGH THE CURRENT CODE CYCLE CONTINUING TO BUILD UPON THAT IN IMPROVE UPON THAT. AND I'M GONNA SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF THE CAMPFIRE HERE IN JUST A MOMENT BRING SOME OF THESE THINGS -- TOGETHER -- DIRECTOR GIL DUE TO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND UPPER IN THE NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER BECAUSE REALLY THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL HERE FOR THE SAME REASON A VERY HIGH LEVEL MAYBE SIXTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL IS. RISK MANAGEMENT HAZARD MANAGEMENT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE UTILITY PROVIDER AN INSURANCE COMPANY. LEGISLATURE'S LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OR JUST MEMBERS LIVING IN A COMMUNITY THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO MITIGATE IN CONTROL MANY OF THESE PIECES -- THAT -- IS -- WAS BORN RETIRED FARMER SHEL -- DARGAN MENTIONED IT'S REALLY TRYING TO TAKE IT DOWN A USE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN A LASER IN ON SPECIFIC PARCELS. BUT BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION PUT IT IT KIND OF VISIT THERE BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THERE YET IN YOUR PART OF SOME OF THE INITIATIVES PART OF THIS BE NOT A ONE LAST YEAR BRINGING TECHNOLOGY TO THE FOREFRONT. AND THAT'S A GREAT STEP MOVING FORWARD IN GETTING SOME OF THOSE PIECES -- IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEACE AND TYING IT IN TO DO THE CAMPFIRE THAT -- I HAVE -- TWO TALES OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH FIRST I I RESPOND AS PART OF THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL IT'S A MANAGEMENT TEAM TO STAFF THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THE TOWN OF PARADISE. FOR A PERIOD OF A WEEK RIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING -- AND AS A AS A LINE FIREFIGHTER WRITTEN COMING UP TO THE RANKS AND RESPONDING IN APPLYING THESE EMERGENCIES IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ROLE WHEN YOU WALK INTO ANY -- SEE THAT STAFFED SOLELY BY TOWN OF PARADISE EMPLOYEES THAT FIFTY ONE OUT OF SIXTY NINE TOLL EMPLOYEES LOST THEIR HOMES SO TALK OF AN IDEA WAS TO IN TERMS OF POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN DEVELOPING SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WAS INSTRUMENTAL. OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL AND OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT AND REALLY JUST CAN'T BE UNDERSTATED TO TALK ABOUT TRULY HOW RESILIENT OF A COMMUNITY THEY ARE THAT THEY WERE STILL STAFFING THE EOC EVEN IN THE WAKE OF EVERYTHING THEY HAD -- SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS THEIR RECORD IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU KNOW THE FIRE THAT REALLY IT BY THIS POINT THE EMERGENCY ITSELF IN THE TOWN HAD -- ED MITIGATED WE ARE MOVING TO CODES AT THE TOP OF TOWN THERE'S A NEW DEVELOPMENT OF DUPLEXES THAT WERE BUILT WITH THE MODERN CODE MODERN STANDARDS -- AS IS BEEN MENTIONED IN THE FIRST TEN HOURS OF THE FIRE FIGHT NOBODY WAS FIGHTING FIRE IT WAS ABOUT RESCUE WILL THIS DUPLEXES COMMITTEE OF DUPLEXES THAT DAY I THINK TEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT BUILDINGS ONE BUILDING. BURNED DOWN THE REST WITH STOOD WITH NO FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. THE COACH WORK BUT NEVER COMES BACK TO THE ENFORCEMENT THE ACCOUNTABILITY AS FAR MARSHALL ARGAN POINTED OUT -- THAN PUTTING SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN PLACE AND THEN THE STUFF BECAUSE YOU REALLY SCRATCH YOUR HEAD AS YOU GO INTO THE MIDDLE OF A PARKING LOT. IS A VEHICLE THERE'S NO VEGETATION NEARBY IT'S NOT NEAR ANY STRUCTURES IT'S ALL BY ITSELF. IT IS COMPLETELY GUTTED AND BURNED TO THE GROUND WELL IF A METAL FLAKE MENTAL VEHICLE ON THE OUTSIDE ISN'T FIRE RESISTANT REAR WHERE WE FINDING OURSELVES RIGHT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE IRONIES THAT. MAKES YOU REALLY PONDER AS YOU'RE MOVING THROUGH THAT -- IN AS WE TALK ABOUT THE SPOTTING AND BURNING FROM WITHIN AS IS BEEN INDICATED -- MADE. PRELIMINARILY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE CON FOR FORCED A LOSE ABOUT ANNUAL BASIS AS PART OF A NORMAL CYCLE WELL THIS FIRE WAS LEAD WAS SIXTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS THAT TOOK THAT NEEDLE CAST IN BASICALLY CREATED A FINE DID FEEL BAD THROUGHOUT. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AS WE'RE MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY THEY WERE GREEN WASTE CAN SITTING AT THE CURB. FULL OF PINE NEEDLES MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THAT COMMUNITY WERE DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY TO KEEP THEIR COMMUNITY FIRE SAFE. BUT NATURE TOOK OVER GETTING THINGS TOGETHER -- THE NEXT PIECE IS A I ALSO SAYS A CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR ON THE WIRE FOR WHAT WESTERN FIRE CHIES -- BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS IN AWHILE AND FOLLOW VIOLIN FIRE POLICY COMMITTEE. BRINGING TOGETHER SOME INITIATIVES TO REALLY REFLECT THE WESTERN STATES WALL ANY DRIVE EDUCATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD CAN BURN. NON BURN JUST LIKE IT DOES IN THE WESTERN STATES AND SO WE'VE TAKEN UPON OURSELVES AS THE BOARD WE DID A SUMMIT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN REALLY BROKE. OUR PROBLEM DOWN INTO TRYING TO DEVELOP INITIATIVES INTO PRE EVENT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IDENTIFYING THE PROPERTIES ARE RISK ITS MASTER PLANNING A GENERAL PLANNING. OF COMMUNITIES AND REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT THAT PREPARATION PIECES MAKING SURE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE IS MAKING SURE. YOU KNOW FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITIES ARE WHERE IT'S MAKING SURE THAT DESK I WEIGH IN NINETY NINE CAN HANDLE THE THE THE TRAFFIC OF WE HAVE TO EVACUATE THE TOWN OF PARADISE. IS C. EVENT ITSELF IN THE ABILITY TO MOBILIZE WHICH WE DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO MOVE MORE RESOURCES IN A SHORTER. TIME THAN ANY PLACE ELSE IN THE WORLD BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THEN THE POST EVENT PIECE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING FACTOR TALKING ABOUT THE TOWN OF PARADISE IS THAT. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN AHEAD IF WE HAVE AN EVENT LET'S NOT DO WHAT WE DID BEFORE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE OUTCOME BUT LEARN FROM. THOSE EXPERIENCES TO CONTINUE TO BUILD WHICH IS HOW TO CREATION TO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FIREFIGHTERS WEEK IN ORDER ARMS ARE SMART PHONES. THE LITTLE THING YOU CARE IN YOUR POCKET AS MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN WHAT WE PUT MEN ON THE MOON WITH. AND YET THEY'RE STILL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THAT WE'RE STILL TROUBLING TO TRY TO GET THERE -- AND THEN THE LAST IS PARTNERING WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THEIR LOSSES ARE LOST AS A COMMUNITY LOS WERE REALLY ALL IN THE SAME FIGHT TOGETHER IN PART OF THIS CAMPFIRE TO WERE WE DID. BROUGHT IN MEMBERS FROM THE NATIONAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS OTHER CO DEVELOP DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES TO REALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND TAKE WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND REALLY GIVE THEM. A STRAIGHT FOR CLEAN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE OF THE REASONS OF OF THE NOT ONLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO BUT REALLY BREAKING IT DOWN TO DO -- THE BEING ABLE TO I GUESS TRULY DEMONSTRATED WHAT WE EXPERIENCE OUT HERE IS NOT -- A MARSH FIRE SOME PLACE IN THE IN THE SOUTEAST SO WITH THAT -- AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HE'S NICE JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY YOU PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN JUST A BIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT WE HAVE -- PRESENT BAILEY HERE TODAY HE'S PRESIDENT METRO FIRE HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. WE'RE GRATEFUL SIR THAT YOU'RE HERE WE WELCOME YOU YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WILL GIVE YOU A LINE ONE MINUTE FROM THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO MY NAME'S TIE BAILEY ON MY FIRE CAPTAIN WITH SAC METRO FIRE DISTRICT. I AM ALSO PRESIDENT OF SACRAMENTO AREA FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL FIVE TWO TWO AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. OUR LOCAL IN THIS AREA WE'RE UNIQUE WERE AMALGAMATED I REPRESENT EIGHT FIRE DEPARTMENTS OVER TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS. AS THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SENT OUT ABOUT OUT TO BATTLE WITH WILDLAND FIRES TODAY. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT CREATE HIGH RISK [inaudible] CATASTROPHIC FIRES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF EVERY MAJOR FIRE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION ON SMALL FIXES THAT FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS. BILL MATERIALS DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PROPER EGRESS TEMPORARY REFUGE AND SO FORTH. WELL THESE ARE CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. RE RICH WE RISK OVER ENGINEERING THINGS. IF WE DON'T LOOK AT ALL THE FACTORS IN RISK FACTORS. THOSE REQS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN AN AREA THE INFRASTRUCTURE. FUEL LOADS PREVIOUS FIRE HISTORY AND WEATHER EVENTS. THESE MORE EXPANSIVE RICK'S RISK FACTORS CAN'T BE VIEWED AS STRICTLY LOCAL ISSUES. THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRED TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIA. THESE COST OF THESE DISASTERS ARE LARGELY BORNE BY ALL OF US. IN THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY SAY. CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THE LAND USE POLICY. TAKE THESE RISK FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT. IS IT IT IS. WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER RISK AREAS. BUT WE MUST ALSO LOOK EXTENSIVELY AT THE DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER THE YEARS WITHOUT INTERVENTION. WHILE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE FIRE IMPAIRED US PARADISE WAS BEYOND MEASURE WE KNOW THAT THE TOWN WAS DEVELOPED HALF A CENTURY AGO WITH. PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE MUCH DIFFERENT TODAY. AS WE ASK THE QUESTION. SHOULD WE BUILD IT BACK. WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND LOCAL ZONING AND CONSIDER THE BIG PICTURE. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT FUEL LOADING LOCATION ROADS IN AND OUT. IGNITION SOURCES AND OTHER CASUAL FACTORS. ONLY THEN CAN WE DECIDE. ON THESE ISSUES SUCH AS SPACING ROSE AND STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. OF COURSE. NO ONE SAID PRESCRIPTIONS IS FULL PROOF. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SANTA ROSA FIRE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD WIDE ROADS PLENTY V. GRESS. ANY MANY CASON VERY MODERN MATERIALS. BUT NO AMOUNT OF PREPARATION OR FIRE RESPONSE WAS GOING TO STOP THAT FIRE SWARMING THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. EVEN HERE THESE EXPERIENCE SHOULD OFFER A ROADMAP AS WE LOOK TO REBUILD. AS THE STATE AS TO THE STATE'S ROLE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST REQUIRES A REALISTIC AND MORE CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK OF THE STATE AND ALL THE COMMUNITIES. HAVE WE'VE HEARD CAL FIRES MAPS ARE UNDERGOING A REVISION. BUT EVEN WHEN THESE MAPS ARE CURRIED CAL FIRE IS ONLY REQUIRED TO PUBLISH THE DATA ON VERY HIGH. FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREAS. WHEN YOU OVER IDENTIFY PEOPLE BECOME NUMB TO THE RISK? IN OTHER AREAS. LIKE HIGH -- MODERATE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THE COW FIRE MAP. BUT IN MANY CASES LOCALS LRA LOCAL AREAS DO NOT COMPLY INTENT PENALTIES ARE NOT SAID SIGNIFICANT. THESE LAWS NEED MORE TEETH. ONE EXAMPLE IS SB THREE SEVENTY NINE FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES PROVIDE LONG TERM HAZARD MITIGATION SO PLANS BY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AGENCIES THAT DON'T COMPLY WITH ESPYS THREE SEVENTY NINE MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEMA AID IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC FIRE OR DISASTER. WE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE MASSIVE FIRES IN DISASTERS ON A REGULAR BASIS. BUT THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE STRETCHES WELL BEYOND ONE SET OF BORDERS. AND THE STATE NEEDS. TO TAKE A BROADER VIEW AS WELL. WE CAN'T CONTROL MOTHER NATURE BUT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB DECIDING WHERE AND HOW TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE PATH TO DISASTER. I THINK I HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA I STARTED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKING ON HAND TRUTH. ON THE STANISLAUS NATIONAL FOREST I ALSO WORKED. FOR CAL FIRE FURTHER ADD THREE YEARS. BEFORE I BECAME A FIREFIGHTER WITH METRO FIRE [inaudible] AND SOME OF THE FIRES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY'S A CEDAR. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS FIRST IN OUR FOR RESPONDED OUT WE ARE ONE OF THE FIRST. STRIKE TEAMS. ON THE WHICH FIRE. AND I REMEMBER TELLING THE OTHER FIREFIGHTERS AND I CAME BACK. THAT THIS WAS A CAREER FIRE AND I KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS SPOKE ON THAT EARLIER. HERE WE ARE ELEVEN YEARS LATER AND THE CLEAR FIRES ARE HAPPENING EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW AS THEY SAY THE HUNDRED YEAR FLOODS EVERY RIGHT NOW IT'S EVERY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. AND THE FIRES THAT WERE HAVING TODAY. NEED TO HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH UTILIZING ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE WE'VE AYE FOR TODAY'S BEEN GREAT. BUT IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE THAT'S GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THE EDUCATION PORTION THE TECHNOLOGY BOOTS ON THE GROUND MEETING WITH COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE TAKEN CARE THEIR OWN PARCELS. AND I THINK WE CAN GET IT DONE AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE REPRESENTING THAT FIREFIGHTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND SACRAMENTO AREA. THANK YOU THIS PRESENT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND PLEASE PASS ON OUR THANKS. TO EVERYONE IS ACT WHICH WAS THE WERE MUTUAL AID FOR WEEKS AT A TIME -- YOUR CLEANS FROM THE FIRE THEN OBVIOUSLY UP IN. A PARADISE AS WELL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. WITH THAT WOULD OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE ON FIRST GO TO THE CHAIR IF YOU AS WELL MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. I GUESS TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. WELL FIRST OF ALL. THANKS FOR PUTTING YOURSELVES ON THE LINE STRETCH YOUR ENTIRE CAREER. WHEN ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK EITHER IT MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT DO OR? NO IN THESE IN THESE FIRE CREWS THE TRAUMA PART OF IT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE FOCUS THIS HEARING BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE GOT OUR I OWN TO BECAUSE CAREER FIRES. HAVE CAREER. IMPACTS TO WIN PEOPLE'S WELL BEING AND IT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN FOR US -- YOU MENTIONED. THE MAYOR LAUDER NOTES FORMER MAYOR LOUDER WE'LL CALL YOU MAYOR MISTER MAYOR YOU CAN KEEP THE TITLE I I ALWAYS I THINK YOU'VE EARNED IT FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH -- YOU MENTIONED YOU CHECKED IN WITH THE CITY ABOUT YOUR REBUILDING PLANTS WAS THIS WAS OUR INNER ORDINANCE ADOPTING JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE SWORD IMPLEMENTATION YOU'D MENTIONED SORT OF YOUR AND THEN THE NEW GUIDELINES. WHEN -- WHEN THE CHIEF FOR A RICH ONE WAS TALKING AND ANY? IT IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE. IT WAS OPTIONAL. TO YOU HAVE TO REBUILD UNDER THAT WE WE STANDARDS -- I QUICKLY TEXTED MIGHT TOWN MANAGER I SAID BERMAN I'M FIVE MY IMPRESSION IS THAT IT'S REQUIRED -- SO -- AT LEAST IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE I CAN SAY THAT IT IS IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU HAVE TO REBUILD UNDER THE WILLIE STANDARDS UNDER THE WE SET AN MISTER SNOWING SAME SAME THING THERE IS THOUGH A MOVE AFOOT. IN SOME OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO USE OF PREVIOUS BUILDING CODE IN THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE HAPPENING SO UNLESS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENS. WE WOULD REBUILD TO THE NEW COAT. UNDER EIGHT UNDER A COUNTY ORDINANCE OR UNDERSELL UNDERSTATES Là UNDERSTATE LAW AND IT. BUT WE ADOPT THE STATE LAW LOCALLY YOU ADOPT THAT WILL BE THE WILL BE STANDARD INTO THE INTO YOUR STATE DOOR BUILDING CODE. INTO YOUR BUILDING CODE. SO CAN YOU IS THERE A WAY TO GET OUT OF IT I MEAN YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A MOVEMENT OF MINIMUM STANDARDS UNLESS OR SOME LEGISLATIVE RELIEF [inaudible] UNDERSTOOD -- CAN I INTERJECT HERE PLAY A JOB JUST RECEIVED SOMETHING THAT YESTERDAY OR DAY BEFORE FROM SHASTA COUNTY AND THEY HAD ROLLED THEIR BUILDING CODES AFTER THE CAR FIRE BACK. TO THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN STANDARDS BUT THEN ADDED IN THAT YOU STILL NEED TO MEET WE WE AND AND FIRE SPRINKLERS IN THE NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS. SO I PRESUME THAT WAS TO SAVE PEOPLE MONEY IN TERMS OF ENERGIES ENERGY CALC BECAUSE THE COST REBUILDING IN ALL THESE AREAS IS IS HORRENDOUS IDEA OF BLAKE COUNTY. THE VALLEY FIRE FOUR YEARS AGO EVAN ACHIEVE 20% REBUILD YET IT LA IN AN NAM PARADISE LOST. EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR -- PARADISE AND WE GET A LOS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND HOMES AND AND CONQUER OUT. OF IT YET -- Là AB YEAH HATE TO THINK WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT DOES TO THE ECONOMY THERE AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DISPLACED SO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO REBUILD. I THINK. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE FROM. THE CHAIR AND I A GOING FORWARD I MEAN THE TESTIMONY WE RECEIVED TODAY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPELLING AND THIS IDEA OF AT LEAST PRIMING THE PUMP AND GETTING STARTED ON THE INCENTIVE CITING COMING UP WITH. A WHOLE SUITE OF OF STATE INCENTIVES WHERE WE'RE INTEGRATING WITH THE LOCALS BUT THE KIND OF YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S IN THE TAX CODE OR WHETHER IT'S THROUGH SOME EXISTING PROGRAMS WE HAVE I MEAN THERE'S ALREADY OF A FAIR AMOUNT OF FUNDING APPROPRIATED -- BUT WHETHER WE NEED NEW MECHANISMS TO ADMINISTER SOME OF THAT IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT MEAN ANY. YEAH ANY FEEDBACK YOU ALL MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE ON ON WHAT THAT STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE WE KNOW THAT EVERY COMMUNITIES ALSO DIFFERENT AND BUYING POWERS DIFFERENT RIGHT AND SO EVEN IN. YOU KNOW TAKE THE WILL THE FIRE MALIBU SEMINAL SPRINGS WHICH IS. LOW INCOME TRAILER PARK RIGHT NEXT TO A MANSION RIGHT AND AND THEY'RE NOT THAT FAR APART AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT BIG BEAUTIFUL HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS OR YOU COULD BE LIVING YOU KNOW ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE VERY NEARBY AND SO. HAD A SORT OF TAYLOR THAT AND AND FIND THAT SWEET SPOT I THINK WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE GOING FORWARD THERE WERE THIRTY THREE MOBILE HOME PARKS THE IN THE EFFORT TO BURN DOWN IN. OTHER LOT OF MANUFACTURED HOMES SO THE HOUSING STOCK IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SHOWREEL WHEN THEY CAN COPY PARK YEAH AND IT'S AWFUL TO WATCH THE THE ON THE MOBILE HOME SITES ESPECIALLY THE OLDER HOMES -- JUST HOW COMBUSTIBLE THEY ARE AND HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE TO RETROFIT AND JUST HAVE DECIMATING IT CAN BE OUT THERE I DID WANT TO GIVE -- CHIEF PIMLOTT JUST A CHANCE. TO TO COME BACK TO US I KNOW YOU HAD A FEW OUTSTANDING ISSUES BUT I THEY WANT TO COME BACK. TO THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO IN YOUR EARLIER REMARKS AS BROWN'S JUST EMPHASIZING A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT -- I HEARD TODAY THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE -- IMPORTANT ANDERSON SOME THESE OUTSIDE THE BOX -- CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE BE HAVING THAT PLAYED OUT IN THE CAMP FIRE -- BUT ALSO SOME NEW THINGS ONE IS THIS THE CONCEPT OF THE SHELTERING IN PLACE -- YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FIREFIGHTERS DID AND THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE WENT. JUST BECAUSE IN ON THE CAMPFIRE AND THEY BE NO THEY GRAVITATED TO A PARKING LOT IN A STRUCTURE THAT WAS DEFENDABLE AND FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE. TO PROTECT THOSE CITIZENS THEY WE EVACUATED. YOU KNOW WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE FIRES IN VICTORIA AUSTRALIA FROM THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHERE THE HEY HAD A STAY AND DEFEND POLICY WHERE THEY ALLOW HOMEOWNERS ENCOURAGE THEM TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. WHEN THE FIRE BLEW THROUGH AND WHAT HAPPENED IS OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED? BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRE HIT THE COMMUNITY THEIR HOMES THEY REALIZE THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH FIRE WERE SCARED AND THEY ALL CHOSE TO LEAVE AT A TIME WHEN THE FIRE WAS ACTUALLY PINGING. THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED OUT ON ON ROADS AND SO WE IN THE STATE THE FIRE SERVICE COLLECTIVELY LOOKED AT A READY SET GO. A POLICY WHERE IT WAS GET PEOPLE OUT DO ALL THE THINGS YOU TO PREPARE AND THEN WHEN THE FIRES THERE YOU KNOW EVACUATE EVACUATE EARLY AND ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS IN LAWN FORTUNE TO COME IN AND DO THEIR THING. I THINK WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE CAMP FIRE IS THAT WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVACUATION IS THE FIRST PRIORITY THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE. SHELTERING IN THEIR BASEMENTS LIKE YOU WOULD FOR A TORNADO IN THE MIDWEST BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE. MUNIZ WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET EVERYBODY OUT THROUGH EVACUATIONS BECAUSE OF HOW QUICKLY SO WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THESE IN TERMS OF PRE DESIGNATED. HARD YOU KNOW HARDENED AREAS THAT ARE STAFFED BY FIREFIGHTERS ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS THAT CAN BE THERE FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE SCREEN THERE. THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT THAN -- I EVACUATION ZONE FROM A FLOOD HERE'S WHERE YOU GO IF YOU LIVE IN X. PART OF TOWN AND HAVE ALL THAT INGRAINED IN EVERYBODY'S THOUGHT PROCESS SO THAT AT LEAST. THEY KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO WHEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT AS LONG AS RICH. AS WELL TALK ABOUT HARDENING OF INFRASTRUCTURE ALL WITH ME THAT -- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS PART OF THIS BROADER MITIGATION. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS DIRECTOR KILLER DUCHIN MAYBE LEASE ONE OTHER THAT BROUGHT THAT UP AND THAT'S THERE MAY BE AREAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE JUST AREN'T DEFENDABLE -- THAT WHERE WE NEED TO FACTOR INTO OUR GENERAL PLANS ARE MITIGATION PLANS THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE BUILDABLE ARE THERE OPTIONS. TO MAKE AN OPEN SPACE TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE THAT OUT WHETHER IT'S IMMINENT DOOM IT WHATEVER THAT IS -- UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT DOES COME WITH A HUGE LIABILITY FOR WHOMEVER NOW BECOMES THE OWNER OF THAT PROPERTY WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC OR THROUGH AN A AND H. AWAY. BUT THAT MAY BE ANOTHER OPTION TO TRY TO HELP GET SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE JUST NOT. BUILDABLE FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK WE'VE REALLY GOT TO BE -- YOUR LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING DECISIONS. THIS TIES THAT IS A STATE WIDE ISSUE AND WE WORKED REAL HARD ON TO US SENATE BILL. TWELVE FORTY ONE WAS SENATOR KEOGH TO START THIS LAND USE PLANNING DISCUSSION AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT EVEN TODAY IT'S STILL JUST. ADVICE IT'S STILL JUST THE STATE AND LOCAL EXPERTS SITTING DOWN WITH PLANNING OFFICIALS -- LOCAL OFFICIALS REALLY NEED TO HAVE SOME TEETH TO BE ABLE. TO ENFORCE IT SOME OF THOSE GUIDELINES WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THESE TOUGH DECISIONS IN FORCE A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS. FOR DOING SOME MITIGATION CRITERIA -- I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SOME AREAS WHERE I THINK WE IN THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE. SO FOR OUR FIRE FIGHTING PERSONNEL THAN HERE. I MEAN HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCES DEALING WITH THAT LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING PROCESS WHERE YOU SEEN THEM LISTEN. A DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU'RE THE IS PERSON IN UNIFORM THERE AND SORT OF I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCE GOING THROUGH. I THEIR PARTICIPATION IN GENERAL PLANNING PROCESS I I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH INTERFACES THAT YOU GOT IT'S GOT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO BE DOING TO BUT IS THAT A COMPLETE THAT A VIABLE PATH TO SORT OF JUST GETTING MORE INVOLVED IN THAT GOVERNANCE PROCESS. IN NO WE WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN IN THAT A OUR AGENTS YOU KNOW FIRE AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ALWAYS INVOLVED IN THE GENERAL PLAN IS PART OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT IN LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THOSE RISKS EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY WERE INVOLVED IN HELPING DEVELOP THE HAZARD MITIGATION. PLANS IN PULLING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND COMMENTING ON THEM YOU KNOW WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. YOU CAN LIE IT'S YOU KNOW POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT THE CITY. SAFETY SIDE ONE THING YOU GET DOWN TO THE SPECIFIC IF FORTY SOME OF IT COMES BACK TO RELATIONSHIPS IF YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT CRITICAL PIECE. BUT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT SOLVE THE LOCKS US TOGETHER RADIO WOULD THEN IN IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I'M A SPECIAL DISTRICT OVERLAYS TO CITIES WE HAVE GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OF THE CITIES IN OR JURISDICTION. WERE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE DECISIONS BEING MADE FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION OR PLANNED DEVELOPMENT -- MASTER PLANNING STRATEGIC PLANNING -- YOU KNOW WHERE OTHERS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S DEPENDED UPON RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE A A CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT OR A DEPENDENT. COUNTY YOU KNOW FIRE DISTRICT YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE -- BUT LITTLE MORE COHESIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH REPORTING TO THE SAME BOSS AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS ABOUT INVOLVEMENT IN WERE YOU KNOW WE ARE ABSOLUTELY -- INVOLVED IN IN BRINGING THAT PIECE FORD M. IF IF YOU MAY I TOUCH ON THE THE THE CODE PIECE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINUTE AGO. THAT -- BIT. RIGHT NOW THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE CODES TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL -- EVERY THREE YEARS THROUGH THE CONSENSUS BUILDING PROCESS BUILDS THE MODEL CODE AND IN THE CALIFORNIA TAKES THAT MODEL CODE IN ROLES IN. CALIFORNIA AMENDMENTS AND THEY HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF BASICALLY BY JUNE THIRTIETH THEY NEED TO ROLL OUT THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE IN WHICH LOCAL AGENCIES THEN HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IN A QUESTION THE CODE IS THAT THE LOCAL AGENCY CANNOT ADOPT A CODE THAT IS LESS LENIENT. THAN WHAT THE STATE ADOPTS WE CAN BE MORE STRINGENT BUT WE CAN ONLY BE MORE STRINGENT IF THERE'S TOPOGRAPHIC. GEOLOGIC. CLIMACTIC IN THERE'S ONE MORE APOLOGIZE HAVE DINNER THERE'S FOUR THERE'S FOUR FACTORS TO GIVE US THE ABILITY AND HAD THE IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE. A PROVISION IN OUR CODE MORE STRANGE IT HAS TO BE DEPENDENT ON A SPECIAL RISK OR UNIQUE RISK EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITY MEAN TOWN OF PARADISE AND ISSUES AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE AT SOME POINT OF OUR CONVERSATION. IT'S SURROUNDED BY A DEEP CAP YOU KNOW -- CANYONS THAT ARE OPEN LAND BLM LAND THAT POSES A HAZARD IT'S UNIQUE COMPARED TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OR THE CITY OF ELK GROVE -- BUT BUT WE CAN'T ADOPT A CODE IT'S LESS LENIENT TO THE WHAT THE STATE IS ADOPTED. NAY UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT IS THAT A STATE LAW IS THAT IS THAT IN STATE LAUNCH THAT YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY BUT IT I KNOW IT IS IT IS PART OF THE STATE YEAH IT'S IT'S PART OF THE FIRE CODE IS BUILDING AND WHAT YOU CAN. BUILD AND SO THE STATE ADOPTED IN THE BEFORE IT ALTERNATELY COMES DOWN -- TO THE LOCAL LIKE I CAN SAY TO YOU SPECIFICALLY WHERE THAT IS BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THAT INFORMATION SO TO MISTER TOWNS ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT THAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE SO HOW HOW HOW DOES BUTTE PLANNED. BUT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION AHEAD OF US ACTUALLY WORK WE WILL BE ADOPTING THE NEW COSTA QUESTION IS I THINK FOR US IS ARE WE GONNA BE MORE STRINGENT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL NOT. THERE I DON'T KNOW A PATH AS IN THE FOR PARAMETERS -- TO BE MORE LENIENT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A HARD. YOU KNOW POINT TO MAKE I THINK THE WORK WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE DISK NEW. MANUFACTURED HOMES THE IN THE PAST THE COULD BE. AS OLD AS NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND BE INSTALLED IN THE COUNTY THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT. VERY SAFE IN MY OPINION A UNITS TO BE INSTALLING SO WE ADOPTED A CO THAT LIMITS THE AGE TO TEN YEARS OR NEWER. SO THAT'S THE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE'VE DONE. IN THE COMING THAT'S ALLOWED THROUGH STATE LAW. IN. DO YOU OF WOOD YOU'LL FIND THE FOR THE FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOLKS HERE THE THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT. OUR FORMER AS FAR STATE FIRE MARSHAL MENTION FOR HELPING CITY PLANNERS AND LOCAL SORT OF TRAIN THEMSELVES IN SOME OF THESE BEST PRACTICES DO YOU MEAN. DO I MEAN YOU YOU YOU ALL ARE IN FIRE COUNTRYSIDE IMAGINE THERE'S SORT OF A NATURAL INTEREST TO GO DO THAT BUT YOU DO GET HAVE YOU SEEN THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE RANKS THE JUST LACK OF TRAINING FAMILIAR. I HAVE TWO FIREMAN IN MY OFFICE SO THERE'S VERY CLOSE COORDINATION WITH YELL FIRE. YOU CAN FIRE SO -- I THINK THROUGH THE CONFERENCE'S ASSOCIATIONS BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK THE I THINK THE FIRE CHIEFS IN THE FIRE MARSHALL'S IN OUR COMMUNITY WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING THE PLANNERS HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING. OF THAT THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO EXPLAIN AND GET THINGS ACROSS BOB AND ONE TWELVE FORTY ONE PASSED THE FOR THE FUNDING IN FULL STAFF SUPPORT TO HAVE THAT MORE DIRECT CONTACT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU'RE NEVER FULLY MATERIALIZE FROM FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVES I THINK FROM. THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO ENGAGE WITH THE COUNTY AND LOCAL PARTNERS ON THAT. VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TERMS OF ASHER. RESEARCHER -- MAYBE I SHOULD DIRECT THIS -- TO MERE LAUDER -- ANYONE COULD GET ANSWERED BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TO REBUILD HOMES AND THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPONENTS TO BUILDING HOMES THAT WERE DISCOURAGING THE USE OF GAS FOR COOKING. SO YOU'RE ALL EXTRICITY. AND YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF FUN DEVICES THAT -- YOU NEED TO HAVE POWER. FOR AND SO THE CULPRIT IT SEEMS TO ME WAS HIGH. SUPER WHIMS AND POOR. UTILITY POLES OF MINES AND CONNECTORS [inaudible] SO. THE OFTEN ROOMS P. JEANNIE AND THEIR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY SO -- WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE WE HAVE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT YOU DON'T SEE POWER POLES THERE EVERYTHING'S UNDERGROUND IT IT'S ALL? YOU DON'T SEE A A WIRE ANYWHERE IN THE SKY SO I'M JUST WONDERING IS AT I I THINK IN THE END THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT IN IN PARADISE. I DON'T KNOW HOW PRACTICAL IT IS IN AND THAT WITH THE TERRAIN THAT WE HAVE WITH LAVA CAPTIVATED THE GEOGRAPHY IT'S A TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT -- WELL WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND MAKES THE REBUILDING PROCESS -- MORE DIFFICULT I THINK OF THE S. -- NO POWER LINES -- BUT I THINK WE HAVE -- TO ACCEPTED THERE'S GONNA BE SOME THAT -- IF WE GET THESE TREE HARDEN ONES IN AND THEY DO A BETTER JOB OF IT -- THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE REALITY IS THIS FIRE WAS FROM THOSE HIGH KV A LINES THAT YOU SEE. A L. ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE RANCH I'M LIVING ON IN MY TRAILER NOW -- TO BE GRANTED A FRIEND OF MINE OWNS HAS FOUR OF THOSE MAJOR TRANSMISSION LINES RUNNING THROUGH THE PROPERTIES -- BUT WILL FAMILIAR AND BUT THAT'S WHERE THE POWER THAT'S WHERE THE THE FAILURE WAS -- IN THE P. JEANNIE SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GONNA DO SOME RAPID FIRING AND ASK IF OUR PANELISTS WOULD MIND RESPONDING QUICKLY. FIRST OF ALL -- SO BUILDING OFFICIALS HAVE DISCRETION TO BETTER -- I APPROVE REBUILDS -- BASED OFF THE STANDARD WHEN THAT HOME WAS BUILT. AND THERE'S BEEN NO [inaudible] NO. BASED ON THE STANDARD OF THE CODE IN AFFECTED THE TIME THANK YOU EACH PERMIT TO BE INTERMEDIATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION SO -- SHOULD THERE BE FLEXIBILITY LIKE THAT -- WITH IN -- THE WILL WE WELL THAT'S THE DEBATE THAT'S AHEAD OF US I AM NO NO I KNOW PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE GOING WITH THAT THE TOUGHER STANDARD. IN MAKING OUR HARDENING THE STRUCTURES IN THE FIRE ZONE SOME CELLS ARE THAT'S WHERE THE BATTLE IS IS I BELIEVE ONE OF THE BATTLES IS AT ON THE BUILDING BY BUILDING. PARTIAL BY PARTIAL LEVEL. AND SO THOSE ARE THE STANDARDS I THINK THAT SHOULD BE. TIGHTENED THANK YOU REST OF THE PANEL. IT A DATE EVERY PROVISIONED. SPEAK SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FIRE CONSIDER MOST FAMILIAR WITH MY WORLD. EVERY PROVISION WITHIN A FIRE CODE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS GENERATED BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW FROM ADAM HAVING STRICT REGULATIONS FOR ASSEMBLY OCCUPANCIES. TO RESIDENTIAL SPRINKLER SYSTEM RESIDENT NO INDIVIDUAL IS DIED IN A SPRINKLER RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY I MEAN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. AS WE BRING THE RESIDENTIAL SPRINKLER SYSTEMS TO THE FOREFRONT YOU KNOW HIGH PILED STORAGE IN WAREHOUSES IS WE ARE NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE OF THE THE DENSITY OF MATERIALS INCLUDED INTO IT SO THAT A SPRINKLER EITHER COULDN'T CONTROL IT. OR IF THERE WAS NO SPRINKLER BECAUSE IT WAS DEVELOPED IT WAS EXISTING -- NONCONFORMING TYPE OF A STRUCTURE AN INABILITY TO GET THE STREAMS TO THE BACK BUT EVERYTHING WITHIN THE CODES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T DONE PROPERLY FROM SEISMIC STANDARDS IN NEED TO EXIST AS WE LEARN MORE WE BRING THOSE UP TO BE TO BE NO SO THE STRUCTURES CAN BE. MORE HARD AND DID REALLY TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE TO KEEP OUR BUSINESS IS SAFE. AND SO TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT A PREVIOUS CODE IT'S TAKING. KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GAINED SINCE ACT CODE WAS ADOPTED IN JUST REGARDING THAT ADVANCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE. THE POINT TODAY I THINK IT IT'S YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO ADVOCATE. FOR YOU KNOW THE MODERN STANDARDS WERE THERE YOU KNOW WHERE THERE COULD BE FLEXIBILITY I THINK WAS MENTIONED IS YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME OF THE THE ENERGY YOU KNOW COMPONENTS OF YOU KNOW OF THE ASPECT OF THE CODE WITH YOU KNOW WITH REGARD -- TO WE KNOW THINGS WOULD MAKE THAT HOME MORE EFFICIENT I MEAN IF WE WERE LOOKING TO MAY TRY TO MAKE SOME CONSTRUCTION POTENTIALLY. LESS EXPENSIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION THEN THE THEN THE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S FOR I KNOW. OUR COMMITTEES BEEN FOCUSING ON A ARE THOSE LIKE SAFETY STANDARDS AND THERE'S SOME REAL CONCERN. PARTICULARLY WHAT WE KNOW NOW -- IN WHAT WE SEEN ON THE GROUND WHY WE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL DISCRETION. IF WE KNOW THE CITY CENTERS ARE TRUE THE GOING TO SAVE LIVES THIS PRESIDENT THANK YOU WANT TO BE A SAYS. YES I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AB. ALL THE STANDARDS THEY WERE LOOKING AT TODAY [inaudible] THERE. NOT ONLY ARE YOU LOOKING AT HOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR SAFE COMMUNITIES SAFER IN YOUR RESIDENTS SAFER BUT THE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE POLICE NEED TO BUILD YOUR JOB. AND BY HAVING THESE PLANS IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW WHEN-THE WINDS BLOWING SEVENTY EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. BUT WHAT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR US IS WHEN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND EGRESS POINTS ON A ROAD. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUEL. AROUND A HOUSE THAT'S BEEN ELIMINATED SO THAT WE CAN GO IN AND DO OUR JOB. AND SO WHAT I ASK IS THAT WHATEVER WE DO GOING FORWARD. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE COMMUNITY IN THE RESIDENCE IT'S ABOUT ALLOWING THIS THE FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR STATE POLICE OFFICERS ENTER STATE DO OUR JOB IN DOOM SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU IS PRESENT. WHEN I GO TO KEEP IN MIND -- YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR CAREER -- THE SEVERITY OF FIRE CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. ARE GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE. SO WHAT CONCERNS HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE FROM WHERE YOU SEEN THE WAY THESE FIRES TO BURN. IN THE WAY COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN DEALT. ARE THAT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES IF NOT MORE ALL OVER THE STATE THAT ARE JUST WAITING TO BURN AND THE FACT THAT EVERY YEAR IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT CONTINUES TO GET WORSE JUST AS I THINK TIED OTHERS SAID HEY WE THOUGHT WE HAD A CAREER. FIRE WHEN WE WERE AT THE CEDAR FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE EVERY YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE WERE SEEING CAREER FIRES AND THAT THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST. WE HAVE ALL OF THIS AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT LEGACY. EVEN IF YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IS WE HAVE A LIABILITY SITTING OUT THERE IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES HAVE IT'LL STRUCTURES. IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY -- ALONE THAT IS EVEN CONSIDER THESE OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE LRA. ALL OF THEM ARE VULNERABLE AND AS TIES WERE TO CONTINUE TO EXPOSE FIREFIGHTERS IN THE PUBLIC. TO THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TURN THE CORNER. I'M LOOKING BACK AND TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IN OWNING UP TO THE CHALLENGE. WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE I'M ALL ABOUT INCENTIVES IN RE DIRECTING. HAZARD MITIGATION MONEY FROM FEMA RE DIRECTING AND I KNOW THAT FORTY FIVE DAY PLAN TALKS ABOUT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN INVEST. IN SOME OF THESE RETROFITS WE HAVE TO FIND A PLAN -- AND IT THERE MAY HAVE TO BE SOME TO THE FIREMAN'S. TO GET SOME OF THIS MONEY TO ENSURE THAT IT HAPPENS BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME WAYS. TO HELP HOMEOWNERS MAKE THESE CHANGES -- SO THAT WE CAN START YOU KNOW IMPROVING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BIRD THIS YEAR LAST YEAR TO FOR QUESTIONS ON THAT SO -- WERE SEEN HOW FAR THOSE IMMERSIVE IMPLYING AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN CATCHING WE SAW THAT -- IN PARADISE WE SAW THAT IN SANTA ROSA -- SO THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT HAS A WHAT THE MAYOR SAID IS THE SAME THING THAT WE SAW SANTA ROSA ONCE THAT THING GOT GOING. THERE'S NO STOPPING IT WITH THE EMBER CAST IS WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING THE OF THE INTERIOR BURNING OF THE COFFEE PARK. ALL OF YOU KNOW PARADISE REALLY BERNAMA'S FROM THE INSIDE OUT IF YOU WILL BECAUSE THAT WITHIN AN HOUR THE ONLY WERE EMBERS LANDING INSIDE. THE COMMUNITY AND SO I I THINK FOR OF THE GERMAN FROM VENTURA COUNTY EARLIER TALKED ABOUT IT WE SORT OF HAD THIS WE'VE HISTORICALLY HAD THIS PERIMETER. OF DEFENSE DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT PROCESS IF WE KEEP THE FIRE OUT OF THE EDGE OF TOWN WE'RE GOOD WELL IT'S THAT'S REALLY NOT THE CASE ANYMORE AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE. THINKING AND GOING INTERIOR SUBDIVISIONS AND COMMUNITIES THAT WE THINK. ARE NOT IN A WILDLAND FIRE ENVIRONMENT ARE BURNING BECAUSE OF ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION TO BRING BECAUSE OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION -- THERE WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN PROTECT INSIDE COFFEE PARK IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WE SHOULD NEVER NONE OF US EVER THOUGHT. THAT WOULD BURN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY IN IN A DEVELOPED SUBDIVISION BUT WHEN WE STEP BACK AND LOOK. YOU KNOW IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES THE HAMLEY FIRE ACTUALLY DID BURN THERE IT JUST LOOKED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AT THE TIME SO. THERE ARE SOME TOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND OTHER THING INFLUENCED FIRE BEHAVIOR THERE AND SO WE NEED TO GO DEEPER. INTO WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY CONSIDER TO BE URBAN AREAS AND AND DO SOME MORE ANALYSIS TO ENSURE BURKE CATCHING ALL OF THESE THESE FIRE PRONE AREAS. WE WE PUT A LOT OF WAY ON HAZARD MITIGATION DOLLARS. BUT THOSE ARE THE EASIEST TO BE TO DEAL WITH -- THE AND IT HAPPENS AFTER INCIDENT ANY COULD HAPPEN -- WERE STILL SEEN DOLLARS THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE VALLEY FIRE. SO. IS THAT REALLY A RELATED TO CHIEF DO YOU THINK THAT'S A REALISTIC APPROACH. WELL I THINK IF WE DON'T CONTINUES PURSUE THAT YOU KNOW WILL BE REMISS BUT NO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY SINGLE ANSWER WE CAN BE TO LOOK AT OTHER YOU KNOW FUNDING SOURCES. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A GOVERNMENT PROBLEM EITHER I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING AND OTHER ENTREPRENEURIAL WAYS TO GET SOME OF THIS WORK. DONE AND I FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND OTHERS THIS IS IT ITIS GOING TO TAKE ALL. EFFORTS -- PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING SOURCES AND INCENTIVES AND SOME REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE I WOULD OWN THESE HOMES HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TOO BUT YOU JUST CAN'T EXPECT A HOMEOWNER TO COME IN AND WANT TO MAKE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THEIR HOME TODAY -- TO MAKE IT FIRE SAFE I MEANS WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE THAT AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE. ME A MULTIPLE SOURCES OF FUNDING VARIOUS LEVELS. THE AND COME BACK TO WHERE IS SINCE THIS IN THE PLANNING COMMUNITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WITH FIRE MARSHALS AS WELL -- ON NOT ALLOWING FOR LOCAL DISCRETION WITHIN THE WILL HE IT'S A CLUSTER. WELL. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN THE LAND USE PROCESS LIKE WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL HAS MAGIC MITIGATION PLAN. AND GETTING INTO THE GENERAL PLAN THAT'S WERE WE THEN ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC IN THE PUBLIC POLLS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WE HAVEREALLY HARD FOUGHT COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND WE IDENTIFY PRIORITIES AND GROWTH AREAS ALL THOSE. NO NO TRAIN WRECK BUT THEN IT BUILDING OFFICIALS DON'T WANT TO STAY DAY TO TAKE THAT DISCUSSION AWAY. AND IN SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND BILLS THAT HAVE MOVED IN THE PAST. TWENTY FOUR MONTHS -- WE CAN'T -- IN AGAIN NOT AT ALL FROM DOESN'T OFFICIALS ANY THE BUS BECAUSE THEY'RE FANTASTIC. AND I JUST LIKE THE LEGISLATURE -- A LOT OF OPINIONS I IN ANY TIME. THERE SIGNIFICAN CERTAIN SO -- HOW DO WE DRIVE THAT? AND AND I APPRECIATE AND POIGNANT SPONSOR AND THANK YOU I'M NOT A BUILDING OFFICIAL SO IT'S OKAY NO I AM. BUT BUT IT'S TRUE LIKE WITHIN WITHIN YOUR SHOP THOUGH YEAH RIGHT. YOUR FOLKS ARE SAYING THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL SAY WELL IT SHOULD BE UP TO LOCALS. I IN SOME THAT SAY AS YOU JUST SAID IS WE NEED TO BE TAKEN THOSE NEW STANDARDS WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE CHIEF AND FROM THE PRESIDENT. SO HOW DO WE DRIVE CONSENSUS WE KNOW THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WELL TOUGH QUESTION I THINK THAT THE THE GENERALLY SPEAKING YOUR BUILDING OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO BE HARD. ADVOCATES FOR A TOUGH BUILDING CODE AND I THINK IT'S ONLY AS THE THE PRESSURE COMES ON THEM INDIVIDUALLY LIKE CASE BY CASE WERE YOU SEE THEN THOSE. TOUGH DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN ON THE LOCAL LEVEL OF ALLOWANCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE THEY'RE NOT THE PROBLEM THEY'RE NOT IN THE WAY OF IN FORCING A TOUGH BUILDING CODE. WE HAD SOME CHALLENGES BUT OKAY BUT I'M GONNA SAY THAT AND I KNOW THAT ISN'T THAT WERE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THIS YEAR BECAUSE I LOOK. IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THE NO BRAINER THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THAT WE SHOULD BE ALLOWING RECONSTRUCTION AT A LESSER STANDARD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES A WHOLE HOME HARDENING. I AGREE TO CHIEF THERE MAY BE SOME THE FLEXIBLE ON BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING YOUR HOME MORE RESILIENT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN THE WILL HE WHY ARE WE EVEN HAVING THIS DEBATE. CHIEF IT JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THAT. THE STATE ADOPTED CODE LOCALS CAN ONLY BE MORE STRINGENT WE CAN'T BE LESS STRINGENT SO WE CAN'T BE MORE LENIENT WE CAN DISREGARD. WHAT THE STATE CODE SAYS WE NEED TO DO WITH THE PROVISION THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE CODE TO GIVES US A LITTLE BIT DISCRETION IS CALLED ALTERNATIVE MEANS AND METHODS? BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE DEMONSTRATED THAT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO MAYBE TWO LAYERS OF SHEET ROCK ON A WALL TO INCREASE THE FIRE RATING IN A PARTICULAR ROOM WELL THAT'S FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR FOR RECONSTRUCTION YOU CAN GO BACK THOUGH IT WHAT RICANS WILL THE DISCOUNT WE HAVE. IS EXISTING NON CONFORMING I WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES MEANING. IT WAS A COMPLIANT WITH IT WELL WE WOULD HOPE LET'S LET'S GO WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE THE HOME WAS BUILT OVER THE DOCUMENTS HE WAS BUILT. TO THE CODE THAT EXISTED THE TIME THE PERMIT WAS PULLED AND SO IF THAT BUILDING HAS NOT GONE THROUGH A TENANT IMPROVEMENT OR REMODEL A NEW PERMIT PULLED SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IT COMPLIES WITH WHATEVER NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO CODE THAT EXISTED THERE NOT SPRING CLEARED DO YOU KNOW AND A LOT OF THE THE OTHER PIECES THAT'S THE CHALLENGEBUT YEAH HOW DO YOU GO BACK IN AND TALK ABOUT SOME A MAYBE. MAYBE SOME OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ESPECIALLY FOR THAT STUFF IN THE IN THE WE WE AND AS FAR MOTION ORGAN POINT OUT THE V. ESTIMATED TO DO GRANT PRO SO THAT TO CREATE. TO GET THOSE THEIR VOCAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO BACK IN AND FORCE A CO DIRECTOR OF RETROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT. OF OF OF A MORE MODERN CODE -- ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE A COULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL IN SUMMER GARDEN IN THAT'S BEEN SOME OF THE DEBATE THAT WE'VE HAD IT WITHIN OUR COMMITTEE CAN SOME SAY -- THAT. LOCALS DO BUT I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE NEEDS THE MONEY PUT ON THE TABLE I A FOR SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING A COMMITTEES MORE SO I THINK WORK TO KIDA NIBBLING AT IS THAT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE CAN WE IF SOMEONE'S REMODELING. A KITCHEN CAN WE REQUIRE THEM TO PUT ON BETTER COVERS OR EVEN COVERS AND RIGHT NOW NO IS THE ANSWER UNLESS THERE WAS LEGISLATION. THAT REQUIRED THAT OR OR USE THAT AS ONE IS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES ONE OF THE TOOLS AND TOOL BELT TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE SAFE FROM FIRE SAY PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU. CHIEF DID YOU WANNA CHALLENGES HE WAS JUST IT'S ALMOST THREE QUESTION BACK BUT IT'S THE CONCERNED IT'S IT'S IT MAKES NO IT IT'S A NO BRAINER TO ME TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHY SHOULD WE GO BACKWARDS IN AND AS SHE WOULD OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WE WANT THERE. TO REASON THE CODES ARE UPDATED BECAUSE WE LEARNED WHAT ISN'T WORKING WILL LEARN FROM THESE FIRES AFTER THE DAMAGE IS NOT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE CHANGES. YOU KNOW THAT PART I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ARGUMENT. GO BACK OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THESE KINDS OF LAWS AND ORDINANCES CAN BE VERY MUCH ARTICULATED AS SLOW GROWTH -- LOW GROWTH THEIR GROWTH INHIBITORS HOW TO GO BACK TO COMMUNITIES AND SAY IT'S GOING TO COME I'VE OWNED THIS PROPERTY FOR FORTY YEARS NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME. IT'S GOING TO COST TWICE AS MUCH MONEY TO REBUILD. MY HOUSE UNDER THESE NEW STANDARDS SO THE PRESSURE. IS ALWAYS ON EVERYONE TO TRY TO REDUCE THAT TO BRING THE ECONOMY BACK IN SO HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT. THAT CONVERSATION. I THINK YOU HAVE TO THE RIGHT NORMAL THE WAY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO THAT REDWOOD VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE SUBURBAN VALLEY IN THE MINUTES YOU KNOW -- THE REDWOOD AB COMPLEX FIRES BURNED DOWN A THIRD OF THE WATER SYSTEM DISINTEGRATED -- WE HAVE TO BE TO RE BUILD TO STANDARD PIPES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH I'D BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH NEW BUILDING CODE FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS. STATE REASONS AND HAZARD MITIGATION DOLLARS AT FEMA IS ADVANCING -- IN A QUICKER FASHION. IN THE STATE HAD TO PUT ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION IN. THE PROJECT BUT AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM THERE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM MAJORITY THE MONEY. ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT'S WHERE AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THIS FOR THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF -- THE PLANNER HERE IS ALL ST IT'S AN BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE TO PUT SOME INCENTIVES ON THE TABLE TO BE TO MAKE IT WORK CORRECT. MISTER PRESIDENT I KNOW HE DID YOU HAVE ONE OTHER ITEM THE ONES I OKAY [inaudible] FIVE BEFORE WE WRAP IT UP WITH A BETTER TURN OVER DISINGENUOUS AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY URGENCY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF CENTER CERTAIN ENTIRE OF BOTH COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY REALLY REALLY GREAT FOR THE ALL OF YOUR HERE.

IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AS WELL AS THOSE HOMES LOCATED DEEP IN THE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO POINT MADE BY CHIEF RICH WINE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY WIDE HARDENING EFFORTS.
