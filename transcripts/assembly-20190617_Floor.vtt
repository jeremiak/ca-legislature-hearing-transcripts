00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.470
NEARLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.072
AFTER THE EMANCIPATION

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.307
PROCLAMATION.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.641
AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE A UNIQUE

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.243
AND OFTEN PAINFUL HISTORY IN

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.246
AMERICA AND THIS RESOLUTION IS

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.647
NOT ONLY A CELEBRATION.

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.983
BUT A RECOGNITION OF A RESPONSE

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.685
FROM A COMMUNITY ONE BUILT ON

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.286
STRENGTH RESILIENCE AND

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:45.221

FOLLOW THROUGH AND PERSISTENCE

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:52.729
NECESSARY TO ENACT JUSTICE.

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.864
THE NEED TO NOT ONLY PASSED JUST

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.434
LAWS BUT TO ENSURE.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.235
THEY DO WHAT IS INTENDED AND

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:02.272
THAT THOSE IMPACTED BY THE LAWS

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.107
ARE MADE AWARE OF THE CHANGES.

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:06.109
THAT IS HOW TO TRULY MOVE

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:08.144
FORWARD IN WAYS THAT ARE

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.779
DESPERATELY NEEDED.

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:10.647
THE LATINO CAUCUS STANDS IN

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:13.450

MORNING.

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:31.601

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.536
JUNETEENTH I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:35.005

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.906
OF JULY ADDRESS.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.308
FREDERICK DOUGLASS WAS INVITED

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.409
TO SPEAK BEFORE THE DAUGHTERS OF

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:40.710
THE REVOLUTION IN THE EIGHTEEN

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:42.345
FIFTIES.

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:44.147
AND THEY HAD EXPECTED HIM TO

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.815
TELL ALL THE WONDERS OF THE

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:47.317
FOURTH OF JULY.

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:48.685
THE WONDERS OF THIS NEW

CELEBRATE THE CELEBRATION OF

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.621
FREEDOM.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.189
AND HE TALKED ABOUT IT AND THEN

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:56.092
HE SAID IF I BASICALLY FAIL TO

00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:58.194
REMIND YOU WHO WE ARE.

00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.663
IT WOULD BE A CRIME IT WOULD BE

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.264
A SHAME FOR THE NATION'S FOR ME

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:03.066
NOT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE FOURTH

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.834
OF JULY REALLY MEANS TO ME.

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:06.503
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW SLAVERY

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.071
HAD DENIED HIM ALL OF HIS

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.472
FREEDOM.

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.074
ALL OF HIS RIGHTS IN ALL OF HIS

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.876
HUMANITY.

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.077
AND HE SAID SO THEREFORE MY

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.745
SUBJECT TODAY WILL BE AMERICAN

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.180
SLAVERY AND NOT THE FOURTH OF

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.915
JULY.

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:20.617
AND HE SAID THAT IF I COULD GET

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:22.018
THE JERUSALEM.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:23.887
THEN MAY MY RIGHT HAND FORGET

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.522
ARE CUTTING INTO YOUR TONGUE

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.057
CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:29.092
AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.327
CELEBRATION JUNETEENTH.

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:33.196
WE LOOK AT HOW FAR WE'VE COME.

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:34.397
AND YET HOW FAR WE HAVE NOT COME

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.199
AS A NATION.

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:37.400
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:39.269
UNDERSTAND THAT AFRICAN

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.237
AMERICANS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THIS

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.172
COUNTRY.

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.107
AND THE SAD THING IS EVEN IN

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.842
THIS TIME FRAME MANY OF US FEEL

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.977
AS IF WE ARE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:50.180
THE WINDOW OF FREEDOM.

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:51.047
THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:52.182
PICTURE AND THE CELEBRATION

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:54.884
THAT'S THEIR AND IT'S VERY

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.886
PAINFUL TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.855
I REMEMBER ONCE AS A SCHOOL

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:00.223
BOARD MEMBER I TENDED TO BE A

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.826
CELEBRATION ON BEHALF OF THE

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.861
LINCOLN AND WASHINGTON

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:05.395
CELEBRATION OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.696
STUDENTS.

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:09.165
AND I SAW IN THE FACE OF SO MANY

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:10.500
WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY.

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:11.868
THE TEARS THAT THEY SHARE AT

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:14.137
THAT MOMENT.

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.405
AND I BIG REALIZE THAT I FELT

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.207
LIKE AROUND BEEN IT THE

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:17.874
HISTORIAN.

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.375
WHO SAID WHEN HE WENT TO THE

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:20.744
FREEDOM OF GHANA?

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:21.878
AND HE SAW WHEN THEY HAD GOTTEN

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.546
THEIR FREEDOM IN THE NINETEEN

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.514
SIXTIES.

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:26.116
HE SAW THE TEARS ON THEIR FACE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.118
AND THE AND THE WONDER THAT THEY

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:30.320
HAD IN THEIR HEARTS OF OF ONCE

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:31.654
AGAIN GETTING FREEDOM AGAIN.

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:33.189
AND HE SAID HE FELT LIKE AN

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.724
OUTSIDER AGAIN.

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.259
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:38.394
PASSION AND THE SAME LOVE NO

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:40.296
MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIED.

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:41.765
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT IN

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:44.234
RELATIONSHIP TO US AFRICAN

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.268
AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:47.337
WAS STILL TRYING TO TELL THEIR

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.972
STORY ABOUT FREEDOM.

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.774
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFUL

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.476
SLAVERY WAS AND WHAT IT TOOK

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:54.778
FROM US AS A PEOPLE.

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.980
AS WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE A

00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:58.381
LIFE IN THIS NATION.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.316
A PAINFUL SITUATION THAT IS

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.718
THERE.

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:03.119
IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO BE

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.687
SURE TO LOOK AT THE SMITHSONIAN

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:06.756
AND LISTEN TO THE TAPES OF THE

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.957
SMITHSONIAN THAT TALKED ABOUT.

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.559
IN NINETEEN THIRTY WHEN THEY

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:11.060
WENT AND THEY INTERVIEWED FORMER

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.629
SLAVES.

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:14.130
AND YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES.

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:15.832
AND YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.267
THEM AFTER THEY WERE FREED.

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:20.236
HOW THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:23.173
NOT EVEN A GOOD CLOSE NOT SHOES

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:25.809
ONLY NOT A PENNY IN THEIR POCKET.

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.277
AND HOW THEY HAD TO STRUGGLE SO

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.612
HARD JUST TO MAKE AN EXISTENCE

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:30.914
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.849
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SOMEONE

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:34.584
SAID TO THE ONE PERSON HE SAID.

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.219
BEEN REALLY HE SAID YOU WOULD

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:37.720
HAVE PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.122
SLAVERY BECAUSE AT LEAST YOU

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.423
KNEW WHO OWNS YOU AND WHERE YOU

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.925
WOULD STAY IN WHERE YOU WOULD

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:43.193
SLEEP IN WHERE YOU WOULD EAT.

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:45.261
AND THIS MAN SAID AND I REMEMBER

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.663
THIS SO CLEARLY BECAUSE IT WAS

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:47.797
AT THE END OF THE FILM HE SAID

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:50.934
IF I THOUGHT. FOR ONE MOMENT.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.535
THAT SLAVERY WOULD COME BACK

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.937
TOMORROW.

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:58.341
I WOULD KILL MYSELF TODAY.

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.176
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:01.110
STRUGGLE REALLY HARD IN THIS

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:02.779
COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE PAIN

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.647
THAT IS THERE.

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.216
BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THAT

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:08.318
WE HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:09.953
JOY THAT WE HAVE.

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.321
IN THIS COUNTRY IS AFRICAN

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.422
AMERICANS.

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.824
AS WE STRUGGLE CONSTANTLY WITH

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.793
AN APPLE OPTIMISTIC VIEW POINT.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.361
THAT THE WORLD WILL BE BETTER

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.530
TOMORROW THAT EVERYTHING WE DO

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.298
WILL CHANGE THE WORLD THAT WE

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.166
LIVE IN.

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.701
AND THAT WE HAVE THE UNIQUE

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.002
OPPORTUNITY THE UNIQUE

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:28.171
OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE GENERATION

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.673
THAT FINALLY OVERCOMES SOME OF

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.008
THE MONSTERS OF OUR OUR

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.576
FOREFATHERS.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:36.946
THEN WE CAN PIERCE THOSE PARTS.

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.982
THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:40.049
I REMEMBER I WROTE AN ARTICLE

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.451
AFTER OBAMA WON IN IOWA.

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.086
AND I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:44.053
MY CLASSROOM.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.555
AND I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR A

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.891
MAGAZINE IN OCEANSIDE THIS SAYS

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.959
PLANTING TREES WITHOUT SEEING

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:50.894
THE FOREST.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.395
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN WORKING SO

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:54.030
HARD TO CHANGE THE HEARTS AND

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:55.531
MINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.233
CLASSES AND WHEN I LOOKED UP

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.370
THERE WAS A FOREST OF GOOD WILL.

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:02.405
AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.140
STRUGGLE EACH AND EVERY DAY.

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.909
AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.877
IS JOY IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:08.745
COMMUNITIES.

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.280
YOU WILL HEAR SOME OF THE DAY

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:11.147
WHEN YOU HEAR A SONG THAT'S

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.515
GOING TO BE SOME.

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.684
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT DESPITE

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:15.485
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.987
HAPPENED THERE IS NO BITTERNESS.

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.023
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT NOT BEING

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:22.225
BITTER BUT BEING BETTER.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.860
AND I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU ALSO

EXISTED IN OUR COMMUNITY.

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.834
AND DESPITE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.036
STRUGGLE EVERY DAY TO MAKE A

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.737
