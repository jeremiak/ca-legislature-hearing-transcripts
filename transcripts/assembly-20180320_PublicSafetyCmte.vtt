00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:29.414 region:rollup2
TO THE SPECIFIC TRAINING.

WE JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:40.124 region:rollup2
GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE

HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED WITH ANY

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.493 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS AN

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:45.163 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROBLEM.

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:46.431 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT SEACM A PROPOSITION

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:49.167 region:rollup2

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.275 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:59.110 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:00.878 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.547 region:rollup2

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:04.749 region:rollup2
A WHEN HAS THE STATE OF

00:43:02.547 --> 00:43:06.484 region:rollup2

00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:13.524 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE SEEN COMING IN

00:43:11.823 --> 00:43:15.359 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FROM THIS BODY IS THE

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:17.195 region:rollup2
FACT THAT. THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:18.329 region:rollup2

00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:19.497 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WITH WHICH THEY HAVE

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:21.399 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OR

00:43:19.497 --> 00:43:23.000 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING. AND THAT THE

00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:23.768 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS ONCE

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.336 region:rollup2

PLACE A THAT HAVE NO BEARING IN

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:34.712 region:rollup2
REALITY OR UNDERSTANDING OF. A

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:38.816 region:rollup2
OF CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS OR OF

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:39.183 region:rollup2
FIREARMS OR THE FIREARM INDUSTRY

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.750 region:rollup2
OR CULTURE. A.

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:41.052 region:rollup2
I AND UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.086 region:rollup2
NORMALLY I WOULD NOT DESCRIBE

00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:44.155 region:rollup2
MAIENSCHEIN WE'RE NOT SUBSCRIBE

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:45.056 region:rollup2
TO THE SLIPPERY SLOPE THEORY BUT

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:46.591 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CALIFORNIA

00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:47.792 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS PROOF POSITIVE

00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:49.327 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO FIREARMS THAT

00:43:47.792 --> 00:43:50.528 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE.

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:51.963 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU SO MISTER ARE

00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:52.997 region:rollup2
GONNA HOW YOU RESPOND TO SORT OF

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:54.732 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE POINT OF HEARING

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:55.833 region:rollup2
IS A SOLUTION. SEARCH OF A

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:57.335 region:rollup2
PROBLEM I MEAN THERE SEEMS TO BE

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:58.903 region:rollup2
SOME CONSENSUS THAT THIS MORE

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:00.204 region:rollup2
LAST REFLECTS EXISTING PRACTICE

00:43:58.903 --> 00:44:01.372 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE'S SOME COUNTY BID ON

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:03.341 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ROLE OF RELIGION.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:04.208 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THERE I I DO THINK THAT

00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:05.109 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS KIND ON

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.777 region:rollup2

LAW WILL?

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:12.517 region:rollup2
CHANGE EXISTING PRACTICES IN A

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:16.087 region:rollup2
WAY THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVES GUN

00:44:12.517 --> 00:44:16.654 region:rollup2
SAFETY SO WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE

00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:17.155 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.189 region:rollup2
OF.

00:44:17.155 --> 00:44:19.790 region:rollup2

SOMEONE TO SIT BEFORE THIS

00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:28.166 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND SUGGESTED THERE IS

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:29.700 region:rollup2
NOT A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY

00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:31.202 region:rollup2
WITH GUNS? THEY'RE NOT PAYING

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.203 region:rollup2
ATTENTION NOW WITH REGARD TO

00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:34.105 region:rollup2
THIS SPECIFIC PIECE OF

00:44:32.203 --> 00:44:35.273 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION MISTER KILEY WE DO

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:36.974 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES WITH

00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:38.643 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF OPERATING.

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:40.211 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS SUGGESTED PERHAPS

00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:41.579 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES OF THIS BILL HAVE NO.

00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:42.847 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE SIR.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.182 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH GUNS I WAS ON

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:46.250 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT FOOTING A.

00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:47.952 region:rollup2
IN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WE

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.320 region:rollup2
WENT EXTENSIVE TRAINING A BEFORE

00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:50.354 region:rollup2
WE WERE ALLOWED TO BE ON.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.856 region:rollup2
THE FIRING RANGE.

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.924 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT

00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:55.526 region:rollup2
TO SAY THE CASE IN EVERY SINGLE

00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:57.061 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN SO I MUCH LIKE WE HAVE

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:59.130 region:rollup2
AS A BODY CHOSEN TO REGULATE.

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.331 region:rollup2
THE USE OF A VEHICLES ON OUR

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.999 region:rollup2
STREETS WHICH ARE DEADLY WEAPONS

00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:03.501 region:rollup2
SO IS A CONCEALED LOADED GUN IN

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:05.403 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND SO WE SHOULD

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:06.637 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A MINIMUM TRAINING

00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:08.940 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THERE IS CURRENTLY A

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:10.508 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM. THERE IS NO MINIMUM AND

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.443 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO THAT.

00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:14.011 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:15.213 region:rollup2

GUNS SAFETY LEGISLATION. IN THE

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:24.355 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION SO IT

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.158 region:rollup2

WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE DOES

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.661 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE SOME SORT OF TRAINING

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.295 region:rollup2

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:31.963 region:rollup2
IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT GOING

WOULD BE THAT WE'D HAVE SOME

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.932 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THE PARTICULAR

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:36.300 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GONNA SET

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:37.268 region:rollup2
FORTH IN STATURE RATHER THAN

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.470 region:rollup2
JUST SAYING THAT THESE.

00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:40.771 region:rollup2

PLACE THEN THERE'LL BE A. AN

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.079 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN GUN SAFETY.

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:48.946 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR BILL WAS CRAFTED

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.348 region:rollup2
WITH LOOKING AT THE BEST

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:51.415 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OF JURISDICTIONS THAT

00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:52.917 region:rollup2
HAVE ESTABLISHED TRAINING

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.818 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND AND HAVE WORKED

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.152 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR WITH THEIR

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:56.220 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH THAT I

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:57.855 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.589 region:rollup2
AGAIN IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT MANY

00:45:57.855 --> 00:46:00.124 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.125 region:rollup2
DO. I WEAR ESTABLISHING THE

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:02.526 region:rollup2
FLOOR FOR WHICH ALL COUNTIES

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.694 region:rollup2
HAVE TO OPERATE ON NOT JUST THE

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:05.730 region:rollup2
ONES THAT I THINK ARE GOOD

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.764 region:rollup2
ACTORS IN TRYING TO ENGAGE IN

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.999 region:rollup2
THIS IN A SENSIBLE WAY.

00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:09.500 region:rollup2
OKAY AND INSIDE IS MY LAST

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:11.135 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I STILL HAVEN'T

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.370 region:rollup2
REALLY SEEN ANY EVIDENCE LINKING

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:13.704 region:rollup2
THESE BIGGER PRACTICES THEN

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.939 region:rollup2
PROVE GOOD GUN SAFETY IS THERE

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:16.240 region:rollup2
ANY. PLACE I COULD FIND THAT

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:17.241 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES FOLKS ARE ENCOURAGED

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.976 region:rollup2
NOT TO SEE WHAT'S BEFORE THEIR

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.511 region:rollup2
OWN EYES AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:22.179 region:rollup2
GUN SAFETY CHALLENGE IN THIS

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.147 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.482 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:26.117 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE TO CARRY A LOADED

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:27.652 region:rollup2
WEAPON IN PUBLIC. THE SHOULD

00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:29.053 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME TRAINING WITH WITH

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:30.721 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THAT AYE THEA THINK WE

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:32.456 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ASKING IS CAN WE

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.624 region:rollup2
PROVE IN THE COUNTIES WHERE A%

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.725 region:rollup2
MINIMUM STANDARD HAS BEEN

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.560 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED THAT THOSE COUNTY

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.294 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW HAVE FEWER OF GUN

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.030 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE SUCH.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:40.798 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.666 region:rollup2
AYE WE CAN WORK ON THAT MISTER

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.566 region:rollup2
KILEY AS YOU WELL KNOW THIS IS

00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:43.934 region:rollup2
THE FIRST HEARING FOR THIS

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:45.236 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL I IMAGINE WE'RE

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.504 region:rollup2
GOING TO A LOT OF WORK RESPOND A

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:48.039 region:rollup2
LOT OF MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS.

00:46:46.504 --> 00:46:49.006 region:rollup2
WILL WORK ON THAT AND I THINK

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:50.207 region:rollup2
THAT THE SHERIFF'S IN THOSE

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:51.876 region:rollup2
LOCAL OFFICIALS ESTABLISH THOSE

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.677 region:rollup2
THOSE MINIMUMS BECAUSE THEY

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:54.612 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS WHAT

00:46:52.677 --> 00:46:55.913 region:rollup2
WAS. WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY IN

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:57.181 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES AND I I'M A

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:58.582 region:rollup2
STAND WITH THE SHERIFF'S AYE IN

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:59.684 region:rollup2
THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:05.923 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THAT.

00:46:59.684 --> 00:47:06.857 region:rollup2
* FOR ON THAT ON THAT ON

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:07.458 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.092 region:rollup2
MISTER QUIRK JUST TO ANSWER%

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:09.627 region:rollup2
MISTER KYLIE'S QUESTION. IF YOU

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:11.796 region:rollup2
LOOK AT CALIFORNIA VERSUS

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
FLORIDA PLACE ONE PLACE WITH

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:14.231 region:rollup2
STRICT GUN CONTROLS ONE WITH

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:16.534 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SEE IN FLORIDA AND

00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IS MORE UNINTENTIONAL

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:25.009 region:rollup2
CHILDREN?

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.578 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY HAVEN'T

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:28.612 region:rollup2
BEEN TRAINED ARE WE WHICH A

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.880 region:rollup2
PREDOMINANTLY IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:31.015 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE TRAINED AND I THINK

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.149 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THAT

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:33.284 region:rollup2
HELPS.

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.851 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT'S NOT EVERY COUNTY

00:47:33.284 --> 00:47:35.619 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.722 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:39.890 region:rollup2
I MISTER.

00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:40.925 region:rollup2
GLORIA I WAS JUST WHAT CLOSING

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.460 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO MY

00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:43.794 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES A QUESTION IN

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.029 region:rollup2
WISCONSIN SINCE MANDATORY A

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.996 region:rollup2
HONEY SAFETY TRAINING COURSES

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:47.331 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THERE HAS

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:50.101 region:rollup2
FATAL AND NONFATAL INCIDENTS.

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.602 region:rollup2
DURING THE STATE'S ANNUAL DEER

00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:53.070 region:rollup2
HUNTING SEASON MAYBE APPLES AND

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:54.238 region:rollup2
ORANGES BUT SINCE THE TRAINING

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.506 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:57.007 region:rollup2
OF THE FATALITY.

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:57.775 region:rollup2
OF THE USE OF THESE WEAPONS I

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.776 region:rollup2
WILL GET YOU SOME MORE

00:47:57.775 --> 00:47:59.977 region:rollup2
INFORMATION EVERY MEMBER THIS

00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:00.878 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE I SHOULD BE FULL

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:01.912 region:rollup2
INFORMED IN THE DECISION MAKING

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:03.514 region:rollup2
IT THEY HAVE.

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:04.582 region:rollup2
BY THINK COMMON SENSE INTUITION

00:48:03.514 --> 00:48:06.217 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE

00:48:04.582 --> 00:48:07.885 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO GO ON PUBLIC WITH A

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:09.553 region:rollup2
LOADED GUN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO

WITH AB NAKED TWENTY SEVEN WE

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:46.870 region:rollup2

EVERY DAY.

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:01.010 region:rollup2

AND FIREARMS.

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:07.183 region:rollup2
THE BILL IN EFFECT ALLOWS PEOPLE

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:08.818 region:rollup2
TO OPT INTO A LONGER WAITING

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.921 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT WAITING PERIOD IS

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:13.122 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT MANY

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.224 region:rollup2
SUICIDES.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:16.926 region:rollup2

AGAINST THE SHOWER CURTAIN.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.343 region:rollup2
JOSEPH BREMEN IS NOT ALONE

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.811 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA KILL THEMSELVES EACH

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:11.648 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.149 region:rollup2
.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.418 region:rollup2
AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.452 region:rollup2
PROVIDES MUCH MORE PROTECTION.

01:09:15.418 --> 01:09:18.187 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:20.156 region:rollup2
A WAITING PERIOD DURING THE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:21.824 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR AFTER SIGNING UP A

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.359 region:rollup2
PERSON CAN PURCHASE A GUN ONLY

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.793 region:rollup2
IF THEY SUBMIT A DECLARATION

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.528 region:rollup2
FROM A PHYSICIAN OR

01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:27.130 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGIST.

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:28.664 region:rollup2
ATTESTING THAT THE PARTICIPANT

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.800 region:rollup2
IS NOT PRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:32.869 region:rollup2
RISK OF HARM. TO SELF OR OTHERS

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.637 region:rollup2
WITH A FIREARM. THERE GOOD

01:09:32.869 --> 01:09:36.005 region:rollup2
REASON TO THINK THIS ADDED LAYER

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:37.006 region:rollup2
PROTECTION WILL PREVENT MANY

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.675 region:rollup2
SUICIDES.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.677 region:rollup2
THE GREAT VIRTUE OF THIS BILL IS

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:42.245 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:43.646 region:rollup2
NO ONE IS AFFECTED TOO DOESN'T

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:45.581 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:47.016 region:rollup2
BUT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IS IT IS

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:49.118 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE OF COURSE ONLY IF

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:50.853 region:rollup2
PEOPLE VOLUNTEER WHAT'S WHAT IF

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:52.188 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PASSES THE BILL BUT

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.923 region:rollup2
NO ONE SIGNS UP.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.526 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:58.194 region:rollup2
I I KNOW THIS FOR PERSONAL AS

01:09:56.526 --> 01:10:00.630 region:rollup2
WELL AS EMPIRICAL REASONS.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:01.764 region:rollup2
MY COAUTHOR FRED VARS AND I

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.332 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TWO

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.634 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STUDIES

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.935 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT MORE THAN FORTY

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:08.237 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:10.239 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:11.974 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WILLING TO WAIVE THEIR

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:13.709 region:rollup2
RIGHTS TO PURCHASE GUNS.

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:15.678 region:rollup2
ONE STUDY OF PEOPLE SEEKING

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:17.180 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC CARE AT A MAJOR

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:19.148 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CENTER FOUND THAT FORTY

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.716 region:rollup2
SIX PERCENT WOULD RESTRICT THEIR

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.717 region:rollup2
FUTURE GUN PURCHASES IN THIS

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.219 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:25.888 region:rollup2
A MORE RECENT STUDY OF INTERNET

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:27.757 region:rollup2
USERS FOUND THAT ABOUT A THIRD

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:29.559 region:rollup2
OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:31.627 region:rollup2
FORTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:33.563 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:35.631 region:rollup2
WITH AMENTAL DISORDER WOULD BE

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:37.233 region:rollup2
WILLING TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.634 region:rollup2
PURCHASE OR POSSESS GUNS.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:41.471 region:rollup2
THE DEMAND FOR THIS KIND OF

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:43.372 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY WAIVER ISN'T ABSTRACT

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:46.676 region:rollup2
MY CO AUTHOR ON THIS STUDY. FRED

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:49.011 region:rollup2
VARS HAS BIPOLAR DISORDER AND

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:51.447 region:rollup2
HAS AT TIMES IN THE PAST BEEN

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:53.649 region:rollup2
SUICIDAL FRED CAME UP WITH THIS

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:55.151 region:rollup2
IDEA OF A WAIVER REGISTRY.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.718 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE REALIZED THAT HE IT

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:57.720 region:rollup2
COULD HELP HIM SAVE HIS OWN

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:59.689 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.959 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:05.294 region:rollup2
BIPOLAR DISORDER DIED BY SUICIDE

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:07.029 region:rollup2
IF FRED HAD HAD EASY ACCESS TO A

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:07.597 region:rollup2
GUN AT CERTAIN POINTS IN HIS

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:10.066 region:rollup2
LIFE HE'D ALREADY BE ONE OF

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:12.335 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:14.237 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.938 region:rollup2
SEVERELY DEPRESSED CAN'T FULLY

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:18.174 region:rollup2

THIS IS FORMED. WELL V. THE

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:48.190 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF HOW DURABLE.

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:52.227 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:52.361 region:rollup2
THAT I SHOULD BE IS.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:52.895 region:rollup2
.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:53.495 region:rollup2
CAN DEPEND ON WHAT THE

01:23:52.895 --> 01:23:54.096 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND RULES OF PARTICULAR

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.131 region:rollup2
STATES AND SO SAFE THAT DON'T

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:57.1000 region:rollup2
HAVE A WAITING PERIOD AT ALL TO

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:58.333 region:rollup2
GO. THERE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:00.602 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT.

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:03.005 region:rollup2
.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:04.573 region:rollup2
THAT GUN SUICIDE IS OFTEN

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:07.009 region:rollup2
IMPULSIVE AND IF YOU CAN GET

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:08.210 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF

01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:10.145 region:rollup2
IMPULSE.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:12.047 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:14.082 region:rollup2
THAT PERIOD OF IMPULSIVE VARIES

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.350 region:rollup2
IN LENGTH AND.

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:17.853 region:rollup2
AND GETTING THEM.

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:19.421 region:rollup2
IF IF THERE'S A STATE THAT HAS

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:21.456 region:rollup2
NO WAITING PERIOD.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:22.925 region:rollup2
SEVEN DAYS WOULD SAVE SOME

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:24.893 region:rollup2
LIVES AND.

01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:26.995 region:rollup2
THREE WEEKS WOULD SAVE SOME

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:28.630 region:rollup2
MORE LIVES AND A YEAR WOULD SAVE

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:31.566 region:rollup2
SOME MORE LIVE AND THERE IS A.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.402 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE ONE VERY PRACTICAL

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.904 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS JUST.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:38.273 region:rollup2
TAKING IN A PARTICULAR STATE

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:40.842 region:rollup2
WHERE IDEAS AND THINKING ABOUT.

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:41.910 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF AN EXTRA OPTIONS

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:43.679 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO GET INDIVIDUALS

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:45.514 region:rollup2
TO LENGTHEN THE WAITING PERIOD

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:46.782 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS THAT'S

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:49.117 region:rollup2
A MANDATORY MATTER?

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:51.353 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOUR

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:53.021 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS AS YOU AYE IN YOUR

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:54.556 region:rollup2
MODEL OR ADOPT IN CALIFORNIA. IT

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.657 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WOULDN'T DO ALL THAT

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:57.392 region:rollup2
MUCH BECAUSE MOST OF THE

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:59.628 region:rollup2
BENEFITS RT CAPTURED UNDER

01:24:57.392 --> 01:25:00.362 region:rollup2
EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW BECAUSE

PERCENTAGE KINDLY TO SET UP A

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.701 region:rollup2
CENTRAL TO THE REGISTRANTS TO

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.568 region:rollup2
RESCIND THE WAIVER BECAUSE THEY

01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:07.769 region:rollup2
WISH TO KILL THEMSELVES

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:09.438 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY ARE NOT LIKELY TO

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:12.841 region:rollup2
WAITING PERIOD. AND SO I.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.676 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:16.345 region:rollup2

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.245 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PROPOSAL WOULD DO UNDER

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:18.780 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW SO WHAT DO YOU

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:20.515 region:rollup2
ENVISION IS KIND OF THE THE

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:23.118 region:rollup2
MARGINAL BENEFIT. OF OF THIS

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:26.688 region:rollup2

THREE WEEK PERIOD AND.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:32.527 region:rollup2
AND THE THE PROPORTION THAT

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:34.429 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CAPTURED THAT YOU WOULD

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:34.963 region:rollup2
SAVE IN JET WITH JUST A THREE

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:37.132 region:rollup2
WEEK PERIOD VERSUS A YEAR

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:38.033 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.601 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT STE

AND THAT'S WHAT WHY PERCENT IN

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:50.646 region:rollup2
THE NEXT BUT THAT'S THE THE

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:53.982 region:rollup2
SENSES YES.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:56.284 region:rollup2

FAIRLY ACCURATELY TO SAVE LIVES

THERE'S JUST ISN'T AS MUCH

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:06.895 region:rollup2

THAT MISTER BONTA GERMANY SINCE

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:39.287 region:rollup2
THE COST OF SETTING UP THIS

FOR THE STATE AND THIS SEEMS

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.559 region:rollup2

NOW TO KEEP COSTS A MINIMAL.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:05.180 region:rollup2

MAKE IT'S EITHER OR.

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:20.128 region:rollup2
BY I ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN

WE'RE DEALING WITH I THINK

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
PRETTY SPECULATIVE BENEFITS HERE

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:25.233 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE EXISTING WAITING

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:26.668 region:rollup2
PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:28.303 region:rollup2
FACT THIS IS A YEAR LONG.

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:29.671 region:rollup2
WEAVER PUREED AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.238 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON BILLION REFERENCE

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.540 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK WAS ONE WEEK.

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:32.607 region:rollup2
.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.909 region:rollup2
YOU DO NEED TO CONSIDER A CABLE

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:35.043 region:rollup2
TO SPEND FIVE MILLION OR TEN

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:37.045 region:rollup2
MILLION ON THIS.

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:38.513 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT IS THIS GOING TO

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:39.815 region:rollup2
SAVE MORE LIVES THAN SAVE HIRING

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.916 region:rollup2
MORE COUNSELORS AT THAT HIGH

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:41.850 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WHO COULD ADDRESS

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:43.685 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING.

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:44.452 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO THAT BE

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:46.021 region:rollup2
PART OF MY CONCERN WITH THIS I

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:47.856 region:rollup2
THINK. AND I I DO HAVE TO

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.190 region:rollup2
MENTION A APART THIS ARTICLE

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:49.691 region:rollup2
THAT I FOUND.

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:51.159 region:rollup2
.

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:52.494 region:rollup2
A LITTLE TROUBLING AND IS THIS

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.762 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:55.397 region:rollup2
THIS COULD SOMEHOW.

01:28:53.762 --> 01:28:57.732 region:rollup2
.

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:58.900 region:rollup2
STILL TAPE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS

01:28:57.732 --> 01:29:00.836 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAY AND THERE'S THIS I

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.504 region:rollup2

IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ACTUALLY ARE

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.583 region:rollup2
QUITE A FEW TYPES OF LOW LEVEL

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:10.585 region:rollup2
CRIMES THAT MAY TEND TO.

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:11.919 region:rollup2
OCCUR A LOT AND THAT THE

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:26.567 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH IN JUST THAT.

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.802 region:rollup2

THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR THIS AND

01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:32.306 region:rollup2
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN

01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:34.108 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT IS NEEDED BEYOND

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:35.076 region:rollup2

LAW ALLOWED.

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:06.640 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS

01:44:05.506 --> 01:44:08.442 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:09.944 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO RECEIVED HUNDREDS

TO RENTAL HOUSING.

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:19.553 region:rollup2
I AND WE THINK THAT THAT

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:20.788 region:rollup2
NUMBER'S UNREPORTED WE THINK

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:21.689 region:rollup2
THERE WERE MANY OF REPORTED

01:44:20.788 --> 01:44:23.357 region:rollup2
CASES BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:25.593 region:rollup2
WHO CALLED. WOULDN'T GIVE US

01:44:27.128 --> 01:44:30.798 region:rollup2
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE.

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:32.600 region:rollup2
FOR FEAR OF OF RETALIATORY

01:44:30.798 --> 01:44:34.068 region:rollup2
EVICTIONS.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.870 region:rollup2
SO FAR WE'VE FILED FOR CRIMINAL

CASES ARE STILL PENDING IN THE

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.073 region:rollup2
COURTS AND WE HAVE.

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:40.474 region:rollup2
AND MANY OTHER CASES THAT WERE

01:44:39.073 --> 01:44:42.910 region:rollup2
STILL REVIEWING FOR EITHER

BOTTLED WATER FOR EXAMPLE.

01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:55.656 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE LEARNED INVESTIGATING

01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:57.024 region:rollup2
IN REVIEWING THESE CASES THAT

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:59.193 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL UNIQUE ISSUES.

01:44:57.024 --> 01:45:01.862 region:rollup2
AND APPLYING TO APPLY THE

01:44:59.193 --> 01:45:04.131 region:rollup2
STATUTE TO RENTAL HOUSING.

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:05.633 region:rollup2
THERE AREN'T ANY REPORTED CASES.

01:45:05.633 --> 01:45:09.136 region:rollup2
THAT INTERPRET THREE NINETY SIX

01:45:07.535 --> 01:45:10.471 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED OTHER IN

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:11.806 region:rollup2
VERY FEW PROSECUTION STATEWIDE

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:14.141 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STATUTE.

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:15.709 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE DISASTERS THAT WERE

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:17.278 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ADDRESSING NOW.

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:18.679 region:rollup2
WE NEED CLEAR STANDARDS FOR REAL

01:45:17.278 --> 01:45:20.581 region:rollup2

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:22.249 region:rollup2
FOR LANDLORDS TENANTS.

01:45:20.581 --> 01:45:23.651 region:rollup2
AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DETER

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:25.386 region:rollup2
PRICE GOUGING AND TO MAKE

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:26.687 region:rollup2
PROSECUTIONS WORKABLE.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:29.190 region:rollup2
AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:30.658 region:rollup2
CLARIFY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PENAL

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:32.359 region:rollup2
CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX AS

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.327 region:rollup2
IT APPLIES TO HOUSING.

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:34.395 region:rollup2
I WOULD EXTEND THREE NINETY SIX

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:35.396 region:rollup2
IS A REACH TO A COUPLE OF

01:45:34.395 --> 01:45:37.097 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:45:35.396 --> 01:45:39.166 region:rollup2
COVERED.

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.800 region:rollup2
AND I'LL TALK FIRST ABOUT WHERE

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:41.135 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATUE

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.702 region:rollup2
EXTENDED.

01:45:41.135 --> 01:45:43.437 region:rollup2
OF THE CENTER OF THE PRESS

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:44.939 region:rollup2
DEMOCRAT RAN A STORY SEVERAL

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:46.273 region:rollup2
WEEKS AFTER THE FIRES THAT

01:45:44.939 --> 01:45:48.209 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO ZILLOW MEDIAN RENTS

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:49.877 region:rollup2
RENTS IN THE COUNTY. WERE UP

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:50.811 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT.

01:45:49.877 --> 01:45:52.479 region:rollup2
THIS IS LARGE THIS WAS LARGELY

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:54.515 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTED TO NEW RENTALS ON THE

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:55.049 region:rollup2
MARKET WHICH WERE. PROPERTIES

01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:56.750 region:rollup2
THAT ONLY CAME UP FOR RENT

01:45:55.049 --> 01:45:58.752 region:rollup2
AFTER.

01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:00.020 region:rollup2
THE FIRES.

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:01.488 region:rollup2
AND FROM VACATION RENTALS THAT

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:03.891 region:rollup2
WERE NOW BEING OFFERED ON A MORE

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:05.292 region:rollup2
LONG TERM OR PERMANENT BASIS.

01:46:03.891 --> 01:46:06.393 region:rollup2
AND OUR VIEW PEOPLE CUT THREE

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:08.562 region:rollup2
NINETY SIX ISN'T CURLY ADDRESS

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:09.763 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE SITUATIONS.

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:11.232 region:rollup2
SO AFTER THE FIRE SOME PROPERTY

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:12.700 region:rollup2
OWNERS RECOGNIZE THAT COULD PULL

01:46:11.232 --> 01:46:13.667 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMESTHAT WERE LISTED FOR

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:16.036 region:rollup2
SALE OFF THE MARKET.

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:17.771 region:rollup2
AND RENT THEM OUT INSTEAD FOR.

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:18.839 region:rollup2
A VERY HIGH RENTS AND SINCE

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:20.908 region:rollup2
THREE NINETY SIX DOZEN APPLIED

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:21.709 region:rollup2
THESE DO RENTALS. THEY COULD

01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:23.477 region:rollup2
CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANTED.

01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:24.011 region:rollup2
.

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:25.946 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY VACATION RENTAL

01:46:24.011 --> 01:46:28.515 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:29.116 region:rollup2
WHO HYPOTHETICALLY BEFORE THE

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:30.050 region:rollup2
FIRE MIGHT'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:31.819 region:rollup2
CHARGE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:32.720 region:rollup2

VACATION ROLL OUT TEN NIGHTS.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.823 region:rollup2
A MONTH.

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:37.291 region:rollup2
EARNING YOU KNOW THREE THOUSAND

01:46:35.823 --> 01:46:38.926 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ROUGHLY.

01:46:37.291 --> 01:46:39.727 region:rollup2
BUT ABSENT THE FIRE THEY WERE

01:46:38.926 --> 01:46:41.528 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CHARGE

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:42.162 region:rollup2
NOTES TO EARN NINE THOUSAND

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:44.031 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH AND A LONG TERM

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:45.199 region:rollup2
LEASE.

01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:46.600 region:rollup2
SO THE SITUATION SKEWED THE

01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:48.636 region:rollup2
MARKET IS THE PRESS DEMOCRAT

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:50.170 region:rollup2
ARTICLE EXPLAINS. AND ALSO REYES

01:46:48.636 --> 01:46:51.939 region:rollup2
BASIC FAIRNESS ISSUES ABOUT WHY

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:53.574 region:rollup2
ONE LANDLORD COULD ONLY CHARGE

01:46:51.939 --> 01:46:54.942 region:rollup2
THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH

01:46:53.574 --> 01:46:55.909 region:rollup2
AND THEIR NEIGHBOR MIGHT BE ABLE

01:46:54.942 --> 01:46:56.710 region:rollup2
TO CHARGE NINE HUNDRED NINE

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:59.246 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:46:56.710 --> 01:47:00.214 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALLY.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:02.716 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THREE FOUR HUNDRED

01:47:00.214 --> 01:47:03.317 region:rollup2
AND IT THREE FOUR THOUSAND. AND

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:08.389 region:rollup2
THE NEIGHBOR Y. PILCHARD NINE

01:47:03.317 --> 01:47:08.689 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:47:08.389 --> 01:47:09.290 region:rollup2
IF IF THE.

01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:09.890 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT TO

01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:10.424 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGE FOLKS FROM PUTTING

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:10.858 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL HOUSING ON THE

01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:13.327 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:14.194 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S A

01:47:13.327 --> 01:47:15.462 region:rollup2
HOUSING SHORTAGE.

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:16.764 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE AB NINETEEN IN

01:47:15.462 --> 01:47:18.465 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WOULD PROVIDE A FAIR

RETURN PROPERTY OWNERS WHO.

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:21.268 region:rollup2
WHO AREN'T ATTEMPTING TO TAKE

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:23.203 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THE OF THE OF A

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:25.039 region:rollup2
DISASTER?

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:26.373 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT SO AB NINETEEN

01:47:25.039 --> 01:47:27.975 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WOULD OFFER WOULD GO TO

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:29.009 region:rollup2
CLEAR MARKET MARKET STATE FAIR

01:47:27.975 --> 01:47:30.544 region:rollup2
MARKET STANDARD IN THE

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:31.812 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS.

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:34.548 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:35.516 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FAIR MARKET

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:37.117 region:rollup2
RATE IS ESTABLISHED BY HIDING IT

01:47:35.516 --> 01:47:38.118 region:rollup2
IS PUBLISHED ON THEIR ON HUD'S

WEBSITE.

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:40.421 region:rollup2
AND NOT EASILY DETERMINABLE

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:42.556 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

01:47:40.421 --> 01:47:43.691 region:rollup2
ITS EASY FOR LANDLORDS TO

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:45.559 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT ITS EASY FOR US AS

01:47:43.691 --> 01:47:47.227 region:rollup2
PROSECUTORS TO PROVE IF WE BRING

01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:48.028 region:rollup2
THESE CASES TO COURT.

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:49.029 region:rollup2
AND THE NEXT YEAR I WOULD LIKE

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:50.798 region:rollup2
TO SEE ADDRESSED OR OF ACTIONS

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:51.865 region:rollup2
BY LANDLORDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF

RAISING RENTS BY MORE THAN TEN

PERCENT.

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:56.804 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO LEGAL AID CINEMA

01:47:54.535 --> 01:47:58.472 region:rollup2
COUNTY SOUGHT TWENTY SIX PERCENT

INCREASE IN EVICTIONS POSE FIRE.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:01.041 region:rollup2
AND WE RECEIVED DOZENS AND

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:02.609 region:rollup2
DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE

01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:05.045 region:rollup2
WHO WERE EVICTED.

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:06.280 region:rollup2
AND THEN SAW THEIR FORMER HOUSE

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:07.381 region:rollup2
ADVERTISE THEIR MUCH HIGHER RATE

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.316 region:rollup2
THAN MUCH HIGHER RENT THEM WHAT

01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:10.417 region:rollup2
THEY WERE PAYING.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:11.985 region:rollup2
WE'VE YOU THE SITUATIONS IS

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:13.187 region:rollup2
MORE EGREGIOUS THAN NORMAL PRICE

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.855 region:rollup2
GOUGING THE EXACERBATE THE

01:48:13.187 --> 01:48:16.156 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BY. CREATING MORE

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:16.957 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PEOPLE AND PUTTING

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.725 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSING

01:48:17.725 --> 01:48:20.060 region:rollup2
AND FURTHER.

.

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:24.231 region:rollup2
MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE.

01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:25.632 region:rollup2
SO AB NINETEEN WOULD ADDRESS

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.368 region:rollup2
THIS BY MAKING EVICTIONS UNDER

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:28.802 region:rollup2
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNLAWFUL.

01:48:27.368 --> 01:48:30.237 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER NOW TO MY

MY OFFICE TO DISCUSS.

01:48:31.939 --> 01:48:36.176 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.978 region:rollup2
THINK AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:39.646 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THE PRICE GOUGING LAW.

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:41.181 region:rollup2

INDICATED ONE OF THE OTHER

01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:45.619 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT A. B. NINETEEN

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:47.421 region:rollup2
NINETEEN ATTEMPTS TO DO IS TO

OWNERS WHO WERE ALREADY IN THE

RENTAL HOUSING MARKET HOW THIS

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:54.028 region:rollup2
STATUTE APPLIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:55.562 region:rollup2
FACT THAT IT'S CURRENTLY LUMPED

01:48:54.028 --> 01:48:57.131 region:rollup2
IN WITH GOODS AND SERVICES.

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:59.066 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT VERY. CLEAR

01:48:57.131 --> 01:49:00.801 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE STANDARDS FOR THE

01:48:59.066 --> 01:49:01.702 region:rollup2
REALTORS FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS

01:49:00.801 --> 01:49:03.604 region:rollup2
AND.

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:04.905 region:rollup2
FOR THE TENANTS THAT WE'VE

01:49:03.604 --> 01:49:06.640 region:rollup2
RECEIVED IN THE LARGE NUMBER OF

01:49:04.905 --> 01:49:08.275 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND WE BELIEVE THAT

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:10.310 region:rollup2
THESE CLARIFICATIONS. ADD TO

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:12.279 region:rollup2
DEFINE IN THE CONTEXT OF HOUSING

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:14.214 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BEFORE AND AFTER RENTAL

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:16.116 region:rollup2
PRICES ARE BASED ON. WOULD

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:17.885 region:rollup2
GREATLY ASSIST IN DETERRING THIS

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:18.352 region:rollup2
AND ASSIST US IN HAVING TO BRING

01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:20.220 region:rollup2
PROSECUTIONS WHEN IT'S

01:49:18.352 --> 01:49:21.355 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.756 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THE

01:49:21.355 --> 01:49:24.024 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD DO IS ALSO CLARIFY

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:25.926 region:rollup2
THAT WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:27.594 region:rollup2
RENTAL HOUSING IT COVERS MOBILE

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:29.463 region:rollup2
HOME PARKS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:31.632 region:rollup2
WELL AWARE. I'M OUR MOBILE HOME

01:49:29.463 --> 01:49:34.301 region:rollup2
PARKS AT UP IN OUR HOMES TO MANY

01:49:31.632 --> 01:49:36.303 region:rollup2
SENIORS AND MANY LOW INCOME. AT

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:36.970 region:rollup2
TENANTS WE HAVE SEEN INSTANCES

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:39.373 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:41.341 region:rollup2
MOBILE HOME RIGHT SPACES HAVE

01:49:39.373 --> 01:49:43.610 region:rollup2
RECEIVED NOTICES IN ACCESS OF

01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:44.211 region:rollup2
THE TEN PERCENT INCREASE AND

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:45.245 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PROPERTY OWNERS

01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:45.846 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT MOBILE HOMES ARE

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:48.315 region:rollup2
NOT COVERED UNDER THE CURRENT

01:49:45.846 --> 01:49:49.083 region:rollup2
LAW. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:50.384 region:rollup2
THAT POINT.

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:51.819 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE'VE FACED

01:49:50.384 --> 01:49:53.554 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:54.254 region:rollup2
HAVE COME IN AND RIGHTFULLY

01:49:53.554 --> 01:49:55.622 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR

01:49:54.254 --> 01:49:57.424 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND GET THEM HOUSING

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:58.926 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS DRIVEN UP

01:49:57.424 --> 01:50:00.461 region:rollup2
THE MARKET. AND WE'VE HEARD A

01:49:58.926 --> 01:50:02.629 region:rollup2
LOT OF JUSTIFICATION FROM

01:50:00.461 --> 01:50:04.164 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS THAT IT'S ONLY

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:05.699 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SO WE'RE

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:06.934 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY PRICE GOUGING.

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:08.735 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE INSURANCE

01:50:06.934 --> 01:50:10.137 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE PAYING THE TAB IT

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:11.605 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON

01:50:10.137 --> 01:50:13.707 region:rollup2
THE VICTIMS BECAUSE IT

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:15.008 region:rollup2
DIMINISHES THEIR COVERAGE. SUCH

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:16.276 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR REPLACEMENT HOUSING

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:18.111 region:rollup2
MAY ONLY LAST FOR SIX MONTHS

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:19.480 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF A YEAR OR LONGER THAT

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:20.981 region:rollup2
MAY TAKE FOR THEM TO REPLACE

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.115 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSING.

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:23.283 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY AT PRICES OUT

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:24.051 region:rollup2
THOSE VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:26.487 region:rollup2
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE

01:50:24.051 --> 01:50:28.122 region:rollup2
INSURANCE WE HAD A LARGE NUMBER

01:50:26.487 --> 01:50:29.323 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE RANCHERS. AND

01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:30.824 region:rollup2
WHO LOST THEIR HOMES DURING THIS

01:50:29.323 --> 01:50:32.759 region:rollup2
FIRE AND THEY HAVE NO INSURANCE

01:50:30.824 --> 01:50:34.128 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T COMPETE IF PEOPLE

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:35.696 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOWED TO.

01:50:34.128 --> 01:50:37.431 region:rollup2
GO BEYOND THE PRICES THAT ARE

01:50:35.696 --> 01:50:39.199 region:rollup2
SET FORTH IN PENAL CODE SECTION

01:50:37.431 --> 01:50:40.000 region:rollup2
THREE NINETY SIX.

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:41.635 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN A

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.370 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WITH THE CURRENT

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:44.004 region:rollup2
VERSION OF THREE NINETY SIX

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.239 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A PROVISION THAT

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:47.040 region:rollup2
ALLOWS.

01:50:45.239 --> 01:50:48.542 region:rollup2
AND THE SELLER OF GOODS TO THAT

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.244 region:rollup2
WERE ON SALE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR

01:50:48.542 --> 01:50:52.713 region:rollup2
TO THE EMERGENCY DEBATE THE TEN

01:50:50.244 --> 01:50:54.948 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASE ON THE REGULAR

01:50:52.713 --> 01:50:56.049 region:rollup2
PRICE OF THE GOOD. SILVA BOTTLED

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:57.184 region:rollup2
WATER WAS ON SALE FOR A DOLLAR

01:50:56.049 --> 01:50:58.852 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE MINUTES NORMALLY TO

01:50:57.184 --> 01:51:00.287 region:rollup2
FIFTY. AND THE SELLER CAN GO

01:50:58.852 --> 01:51:01.688 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE TWO FIFTY PER PRICE

01:51:00.287 --> 01:51:04.057 region:rollup2
AND THEN INCREASE IT BY TEN

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:05.792 region:rollup2
PERCENT. AND WE'VE RECEIVED

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:06.927 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS FROM OWNERS THAT THIS

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:09.696 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

01:51:06.927 --> 01:51:10.964 region:rollup2
TO RETURN THEIR PROPERTY TO FAIR

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:12.933 region:rollup2
MARKET VALUE IF IT WAS.

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:14.701 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T BELOW MARKET RATE BE

01:51:12.933 --> 01:51:15.936 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCY. THIS

01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:17.137 region:rollup2
CREATES A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS

01:51:15.936 --> 01:51:19.006 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:20.541 region:rollup2
STANDARD TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:23.377 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THE FAIR MARKET RENTAL

01:51:20.541 --> 01:51:24.044 region:rollup2
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. THOSE

01:51:23.377 --> 01:51:26.046 region:rollup2
MISTER CHEEVER SAID WHAT WE ARE

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:27.514 region:rollup2

DETERMINABLE RATE THAT'S

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:31.919 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:32.819 region:rollup2
THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY AND TO

01:51:31.919 --> 01:51:34.188 region:rollup2

01:54:18.719 --> 01:54:20.554 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHY

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:22.089 region:rollup2
ARE WE TREATING THE PENALTIES Y.

01:54:20.554 --> 01:54:24.524 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING MORE THINGS ILLEGAL.

01:54:22.089 --> 01:54:26.993 region:rollup2
OUT WIRE WIRE CIVIL PENALTIES

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:27.961 region:rollup2
AND NOT ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE THE

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:28.562 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES YOU WANT TO

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:28.862 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH AND WHY DO WE HAVE

01:54:28.562 --> 01:54:30.430 region:rollup2
TO.

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:33.567 region:rollup2
TRY TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT WOULD

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:37.404 region:rollup2
ORDINARILY BE JUST TYPICAL

01:54:33.567 --> 01:54:38.472 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE ACTIVITY.

01:54:37.404 --> 01:54:40.307 region:rollup2
WELL. SO PEOPLE COULD THREE

01:54:38.472 --> 01:54:41.408 region:rollup2
NINETY SIX IS THAT RT PROVIDES

01:54:40.307 --> 01:54:42.709 region:rollup2
THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN THIS

01:54:41.408 --> 01:54:44.444 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA.

01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:46.947 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES ALSO MAKE.

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:49.049 region:rollup2
THESE VIOLATIONS UNLAWFUL.

01:54:46.947 --> 01:54:50.917 region:rollup2
UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

01:54:49.049 --> 01:54:51.551 region:rollup2
CODE SEVENTEEN TO HUNDREDS OF

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:52.152 region:rollup2
THE CIVIL ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU.

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.887 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I THINK THE ANSWER

01:54:52.152 --> 01:54:55.088 region:rollup2
IS.

01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:56.823 region:rollup2
BUT THIS ATTORNEYS HAVE

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:58.225 region:rollup2
DISCRETION TO BRING THESE

01:54:56.823 --> 01:55:00.093 region:rollup2
ACTIONS EITHER CRIMINAL OR CIVIL

01:54:58.225 --> 01:55:01.228 region:rollup2
E. BASED ON.

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:02.662 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT

01:55:01.228 --> 01:55:03.897 region:rollup2
HEMINGWAY WHEN WHEN REVIEWING A

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:05.732 region:rollup2
CASE IN DETERMINING WHAT THE

01:55:03.897 --> 01:55:06.800 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION WOULD.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:08.001 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.069 region:rollup2
GONNA TRY TO CREATE NEW LAW

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.804 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO.

01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:12.305 region:rollup2
MODIFY EXISTING LAW AND THE

01:55:10.804 --> 01:55:14.341 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES

01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:15.809 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY THERE.

01:55:14.341 --> 01:55:18.011 region:rollup2
I THINK IT DOES EXTEND THEM TO

01:55:15.809 --> 01:55:19.613 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS THE AREAS THAT NOW

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:20.280 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BRINGING ON IBM BUT IF

01:55:19.613 --> 01:55:21.681 region:rollup2
THAT IS RIGHT NOT JUST WATCHING

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.016 region:rollup2
EXPANSION CURRENT LAW CORRECT

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.750 region:rollup2
YEAH SO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.751 region:rollup2
THAT MISTER WHAT AND WHY IS IT

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.886 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO. USE THE

01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:27.220 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL LAW HERE.

01:55:25.886 --> 01:55:28.588 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN JUST THE CIVIL

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:31.358 region:rollup2
PENALTIES THAT ARE ALSO THAT

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:32.092 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:33.026 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I.

01:55:32.092 --> 01:55:33.994 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT IS THE

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:35.295 region:rollup2
A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO

01:55:33.994 --> 01:55:36.396 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCRETION I THINK THERE

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:38.231 region:rollup2
ARE SOME THAT ARE REALLY REALLY

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:39.900 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS AND I THINK THOSE ARE

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:41.568 region:rollup2
DESERVE OF A HIGHER POTENTIAL

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:42.502 region:rollup2
PENALTY QUITE FRANKLY.

01:55:41.568 --> 01:55:44.004 region:rollup2
I THINK IT ALSO CREATES A

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:45.639 region:rollup2
GREATER DETERRENT FOR THOSE THAT

01:55:44.004 --> 01:55:47.007 region:rollup2
ARE INCLINED TO DO IT AS OPPOSED

01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:48.208 region:rollup2
TO JUST FACTORING IN THE COST OF

01:55:47.007 --> 01:55:50.243 region:rollup2
DOING BUSINESS.

01:55:48.208 --> 01:55:51.745 region:rollup2
TO JUSTIFY THEM JACKING UP THEIR

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:53.280 region:rollup2
RATES TO HIGH RATE AND THEN DEAL

01:55:51.745 --> 01:55:55.048 region:rollup2
WITH THAT LATER ECONOMICALLY

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.649 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN. HAVING A THREAT OF

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:57.784 region:rollup2
A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AGAINST

01:55:55.649 --> 01:55:58.618 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:59.419 region:rollup2
YEAH SO I SEE YOUR POINT I MEAN

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:01.588 region:rollup2
JUST SEEMS THAT THE WHOLE POINT

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:03.423 region:rollup2
OF THESE ACTORS DOING THIS IS TO

01:56:01.588 --> 01:56:05.125 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:06.326 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CIVIL

01:56:05.125 --> 01:56:07.294 region:rollup2
PENALTIES THAT OUR MONETARY

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:09.629 region:rollup2
NATURE THAT WOULD.

01:56:07.294 --> 01:56:10.263 region:rollup2
COUNTERACT THAT BENEFIT THEM

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:12.232 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:13.834 region:rollup2
RENT ME OUR HOPE IS WHAT WE'RE

01:56:12.232 --> 01:56:15.435 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR IS TO TURN IN AN

01:56:13.834 --> 01:56:16.870 region:rollup2
IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD LIKE TO NOT

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:18.205 region:rollup2
EVER HAVE TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE

01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:20.607 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S

01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:21.208 region:rollup2
BEEN. VERY DIFFICULT HAVING TO

01:56:20.607 --> 01:56:22.576 region:rollup2
LISTEN TO THE VICTIMS OF THE

01:56:21.208 --> 01:56:24.444 region:rollup2
FIRE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:56:22.576 --> 01:56:26.480 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO WE FEEL

01:56:24.444 --> 01:56:27.948 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A GREATER

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.316 region:rollup2
DETERRENT EFFECT.

01:56:27.948 --> 01:56:30.650 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE THE CRIMINAL.

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:31.551 region:rollup2

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:50.136 region:rollup2
KIND OF ISSUE AT THE END OF THE

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:52.105 region:rollup2

VEHICLE THEFT IS UNIQUE IN THE

SENSE THAT ANY WASTED TIME IN

01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:50.457 region:rollup2
THE REPORTING PROCESS ALLOWS THE

THE SALE OF PARTS.

01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:11.244 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

01:59:31.965 --> 01:59:35.668 region:rollup2
WHEN FRAUD IS DISCOVERED IT IS

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.470 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

TRACKING DOWN STOLEN CARS. THIS

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:56.222 region:rollup2
EMPOWERS THE PROTECTION OF

PERSONAL VEHICLE PROPERTY AND

01:59:56.222 --> 02:00:01.194 region:rollup2
ENABLES THAT SECURITY IS NO

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:00.132 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH

02:13:59.198 --> 02:14:01.333 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS AND COR ARE MEMBERS WE

SURVEYED A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS WE

02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:08.974 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING

02:14:07.673 --> 02:14:10.442 region:rollup2
AT LEAST WITH OUR MEMBERS I JUST

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:12.211 region:rollup2
WANNA PUT THAT ON THE RECORD.

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:13.479 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE DO WORK A LOT ON

02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:15.915 region:rollup2
THESE IMMIGRATION ISSUES WE'VE

02:14:13.479 --> 02:14:17.249 region:rollup2
COSPONSORED. BILLS WITHOUT WITH

02:14:15.915 --> 02:14:18.517 region:rollup2

HERE WE DO WITH THE.

02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:21.820 region:rollup2
SOME WOMAN GONZALEZ FLETCHER

WERE WORKING ON BILL RIGHT NOW

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:24.490 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT

02:14:23.289 --> 02:14:26.859 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WE THINK IT'S.

02:14:24.490 --> 02:14:28.027 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE THAT WITH ICE GOING

02:14:26.859 --> 02:14:28.994 region:rollup2
TO COURT HOUSES THAT WE HAVE TO

02:14:28.027 --> 02:14:30.162 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S HOW WE LOOK

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:32.164 region:rollup2
AT THIS BILL BUT WE STILL THINK

02:14:30.162 --> 02:14:32.665 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE OF PROCEDURAL

02:14:32.164 --> 02:14:34.767 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE.

02:14:32.665 --> 02:14:35.601 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED I DO APPRECIATE AND

02:14:34.767 --> 02:14:37.002 region:rollup2

PUT FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE TO

02:14:37.002 --> 02:14:40.372 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:41.073 region:rollup2
ARE HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK.

02:14:40.372 --> 02:14:43.709 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OUT GOING FOR.

02:14:41.073 --> 02:14:44.710 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:58.657 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN

02:14:44.710 --> 02:15:01.527 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

02:14:58.657 --> 02:15:02.328 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING.

02:15:01.527 --> 02:15:03.395 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR

02:15:02.328 --> 02:15:04.597 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM E.

02:15:03.395 --> 02:15:06.665 region:rollup2
WERE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS

02:15:04.597 --> 02:15:08.133 region:rollup2
PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE WANT

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:09.969 region:rollup2
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR.

02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:11.236 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS THAT

02:15:09.969 --> 02:15:12.838 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ABOUT THE BILL.

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:14.606 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE WE HAVEN'T GOT TO A

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:15.975 region:rollup2
POINT YET WHERE.

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:18.410 region:rollup2
WERE OFF THE BILL.

02:15:15.975 --> 02:15:19.645 region:rollup2
BUT I I DO WANT TO INFORM THE

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:21.480 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON SOME OF THE

02:15:19.645 --> 02:15:22.815 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AND WHY WE

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.183 region:rollup2
ARE STILL OPPOSED.

02:15:22.815 --> 02:15:26.452 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN

02:15:24.183 --> 02:15:28.354 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC GAG ORDER FOR ANY

02:15:26.452 --> 02:15:30.255 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANT IN A CIVIL OR

02:15:28.354 --> 02:15:32.358 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:34.093 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOES NOT MEET THE

02:15:32.358 --> 02:15:37.062 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS CREATED

02:15:34.093 --> 02:15:38.631 region:rollup2
BY THE U. S. SUPREME COURT FOR.

02:15:37.062 --> 02:15:40.599 region:rollup2
PROCEEDINGS IN BOTH A CIVIL OR

02:15:38.631 --> 02:15:42.034 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CONTEXT.

02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:43.969 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PRESUMPTIVE RIGHT OF

02:15:42.034 --> 02:15:46.405 region:rollup2
ACCESS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:46.739 region:rollup2
DIS TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS.

02:15:46.405 --> 02:15:49.508 region:rollup2
AND.

02:15:46.739 --> 02:15:50.476 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE OVERCOME WHEN IT

02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:52.177 region:rollup2
CAN BE SHOWN THAT IT'S

02:15:50.476 --> 02:15:53.879 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO CLOSE

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:56.181 region:rollup2
EVEN PARTIALLY.

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:58.017 region:rollup2
FOR A MORE COMPELLING INTEREST

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:59.651 region:rollup2
AND IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT.

02:15:58.017 --> 02:16:01.920 region:rollup2
THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:03.989 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL'S IMMIGRATION STATUS

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.924 region:rollup2
MEETS THAT STANDARD. ON A CASE

02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:07.593 region:rollup2
BY CASE BASIS AND UNDER THE

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:09.061 region:rollup2
EXISTING RULES RIGHT NOW WE

02:16:07.593 --> 02:16:12.464 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT WORKS WELL.

02:16:09.061 --> 02:16:15.300 region:rollup2
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS.

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:17.503 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM WITH.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:19.405 region:rollup2
THESE ROUTINE TYPES OF

02:16:17.503 --> 02:16:20.606 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT ARE AGREED TO

02:16:19.405 --> 02:16:23.042 region:rollup2
INITIALLY BEING MADE.

02:16:20.606 --> 02:16:24.276 region:rollup2
EXISTING ONE NOW PROVIDES THAT

02:16:23.042 --> 02:16:25.844 region:rollup2
THE ATTORNEY WHO.

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:28.280 region:rollup2
.

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:29.682 region:rollup2
OUR FEELS THAT WAY CAN OBJECT

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:31.183 region:rollup2
AND THEN GO BEFORE THE JUDGE AND

02:16:29.682 --> 02:16:32.017 region:rollup2
THAT DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE

02:16:31.183 --> 02:16:33.052 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT BUT IT'S IN AN

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:35.521 region:rollup2
OPEN COURTROOM.

02:16:33.052 --> 02:16:37.022 region:rollup2
.

02:16:35.521 --> 02:16:39.124 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A PER

02:16:37.022 --> 02:16:41.427 region:rollup2
SE BAN ON THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:43.862 region:rollup2
SEE THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE

02:16:41.427 --> 02:16:45.397 region:rollup2
JUDGE'S QUESTIONS ON THE

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:46.665 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:47.966 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY

02:16:46.665 --> 02:16:49.368 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:51.570 region:rollup2
WITNESSES.

02:16:49.368 --> 02:16:52.704 region:rollup2
AND THE HIGH PROFILE TRIALS EVEN

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:54.006 region:rollup2
ON THERE WAS A SITUATION IN

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:55.874 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THIS ORANGE

02:16:54.006 --> 02:16:57.342 region:rollup2
COUNTY SHERIFF WAS PLANTING JAIL

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:59.278 region:rollup2
INFORMANTS.

02:16:57.342 --> 02:17:00.979 region:rollup2
ARE IN ORDER TO EXTRACT CERTAIN

02:16:59.278 --> 02:17:03.449 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY FROM ALLEGED

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:05.617 region:rollup2
DEFENDANTS IN THEIR CUSTODY.

02:17:03.449 --> 02:17:07.853 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THE

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:10.422 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FROM SEEING THE JUDGES.

02:17:07.853 --> 02:17:11.523 region:rollup2
ARE PROBING OF THOSE WITNESSES

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:12.891 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE IMMIGRATION

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:13.726 region:rollup2
STATUS.

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:15.828 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ALL BE DONE BEHIND

02:17:13.726 --> 02:17:16.895 region:rollup2
CLOSED DOORS.

02:17:15.828 --> 02:17:18.730 region:rollup2
MOREOVER WE DON'T THINK THAT

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:21.700 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THE OBJECTIVE THAT IT

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:22.801 region:rollup2
STATED TO CHIEF ARM BECAUSE.

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:24.436 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT GONNA PROVIDE A LEVEL

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:25.904 region:rollup2
OF COMFORT TO THOSE WHO ARE

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:27.005 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED COMING FORWARD

02:17:25.904 --> 02:17:27.973 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL THE

02:17:27.005 --> 02:17:29.374 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY EVEN IN THIS

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:31.110 region:rollup2
PROCEEDING.

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:33.278 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS

02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:35.914 region:rollup2
WILL COME OUT AND IF THAT'S THE

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:37.950 region:rollup2
CASE THEN. ARMED THERE STILL NOT

02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:40.152 region:rollup2
GOING TO WANT TO COME FORWARD AS

02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:41.854 region:rollup2
A PARTICIPANT IN THE PROCESS.

02:17:40.152 --> 02:17:44.490 region:rollup2
AND.

02:17:41.854 --> 02:17:46.525 region:rollup2
IN DOING SO ARE HOWEVER THE

02:17:44.490 --> 02:17:48.360 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL IN THE. INTEGRITY OF

02:17:46.525 --> 02:17:50.028 region:rollup2
THE JUDICIAL PROCESS WILL BE

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.630 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED AND WE JUST DON'T

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:53.999 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT IS.

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:55.067 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

02:17:53.999 --> 02:17:56.068 region:rollup2
AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE POST

02:17:55.067 --> 02:17:59.371 region:rollup2
FINICKY.

02:17:56.068 --> 02:18:00.672 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITNESS.

GOOD MORNING GUS HERE AM I DS

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:03.709 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION AND

02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:06.078 region:rollup2
FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

02:18:04.543 --> 02:18:08.213 region:rollup2
SENATOR WE ARE FOR WORKING WITH

02:18:06.078 --> 02:18:10.015 region:rollup2

AND WE HOPE TO MOVIE FORWARD TO

02:18:10.015 --> 02:18:14.353 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK. IN PROTECTING

02:18:12.518 --> 02:18:16.355 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND

02:18:14.353 --> 02:18:18.190 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE BOTH

02:18:16.355 --> 02:18:19.191 region:rollup2
VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:21.660 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

02:18:19.191 --> 02:18:24.163 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED. IT'S NOT SO

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:26.064 region:rollup2
MUCH THE PROCEDURAL ASPECT IN

02:18:24.163 --> 02:18:28.167 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT COMES IN DURING

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:29.935 region:rollup2
THE PROCEEDINGS WE ARE MUCH MORE

02:18:28.167 --> 02:18:31.503 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH WHAT WE GET

02:18:29.935 --> 02:18:33.472 region:rollup2
BEFORE THOSE PROCEEDINGS.

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:34.239 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

02:18:33.472 --> 02:18:36.542 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN INCREDIBLE

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:38.010 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF CONFUSION REGARDING

02:18:36.542 --> 02:18:39.611 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTIONS SURROUNDING THE

02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:41.513 region:rollup2
U. VISA WHICH IS AN IMMIGRATION

02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:44.817 region:rollup2

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHICH IS

02:18:56.228 --> 02:19:00.465 region:rollup2

BENEFIT.

02:19:01.333 --> 02:19:06.471 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE WANT IS TO MAKE SURE

02:19:05.304 --> 02:19:08.140 region:rollup2
THAT NOT WITHSTANDING PILL COULD

02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:09.541 region:rollup2

THIS CERTIFICATION.

02:19:17.249 --> 02:19:20.819 region:rollup2
NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE THAT

02:19:19.351 --> 02:19:21.887 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN

02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:24.389 region:rollup2
SOME SIX SEVENTY NINE POINT

02:19:21.887 --> 02:19:25.490 region:rollup2
ELEVEN AND IN MY OPINION THE

02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:28.193 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT'S CURRENTLY

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:29.828 region:rollup2
CONTAINED. AND AS THE STATUTE IS

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:31.597 region:rollup2
PRESENTLY DROPPED IT IS

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:33.732 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT TO PUT MAKE SURE

02:19:31.597 --> 02:19:35.067 region:rollup2
THAT PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES AND

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:37.769 region:rollup2
FRANKLY EVEN DEFENSE COUNSEL

02:19:35.067 --> 02:19:40.105 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. THAT

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:42.040 region:rollup2
THE RULES INVOLVING DISCOVERY

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:43.575 region:rollup2
AND BRADY ARE APPLICABLE EVEN IN

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:46.411 region:rollup2
THESE SITUATIONS

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:48.180 region:rollup2
AND I FEAR THAT IF WE DON'T GET

02:19:46.411 --> 02:19:50.182 region:rollup2
THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE THAT WE

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:52.351 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WITH.

02:19:50.182 --> 02:19:54.553 region:rollup2
SENATOR WIENER STAFF MEMBERS

02:19:52.351 --> 02:19:56.788 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL NOT GET THAT

02:19:54.553 --> 02:19:59.191 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE.

02:19:56.788 --> 02:20:02.261 region:rollup2
WE HAD A CLIP WE HAD A CLIENT IN

02:19:59.191 --> 02:20:04.730 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES AND THIS WOMAN WAS A

02:20:02.261 --> 02:20:07.366 region:rollup2
VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:09.601 region:rollup2
SHE ONE DAY DEFENDED HERSELF

02:20:07.366 --> 02:20:10.168 region:rollup2
AND HER HUSBAND HER ABUSIVE

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:10.869 region:rollup2
HUSBAND WAS ENTERED IN THE

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:12.771 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:14.640 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:16.275 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THESE INJURIES

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:17.976 region:rollup2
SHE WAS CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED

02:20:16.275 --> 02:20:20.245 region:rollup2
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:23.315 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS NOT INTO HELL WE WERE

02:20:20.245 --> 02:20:25.183 region:rollup2
ABLE TO RECEIVE THE INFORMATION

02:20:23.315 --> 02:20:28.120 region:rollup2
REGARDING HIS APPLICATION AND

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:30.088 region:rollup2
HIS STATEMENT IN SUBMITTING THE

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:32.157 region:rollup2
U. VISA APPLICATION. THAT WE

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:34.159 region:rollup2
FOUND OUT THAT HIS STORY HAD HAD

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:35.861 region:rollup2
THAT HIS VERSION OF WHAT HE

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:38.096 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED TO DEPARTMENT OF

02:20:35.861 --> 02:20:39.765 region:rollup2
HOMELAND SECURITY WAS QUITE

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:41.533 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HOW.

02:20:39.765 --> 02:20:42.567 region:rollup2
HOW HE PRESENTED THE INFORMATION

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:44.336 region:rollup2
TO THE POLICE OFFICERS AT THE

02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:46.104 region:rollup2
TIME OF THE ARREST?

02:20:44.336 --> 02:20:47.906 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF GETTING THAT

02:20:46.104 --> 02:20:49.641 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT OF

02:20:47.906 --> 02:20:52.544 region:rollup2
HOMELAND SECURITY.

02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:54.813 region:rollup2
THEN WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE A

02:20:52.544 --> 02:20:56.381 region:rollup2
DISMISSAL FOR THIS CLIENT AND BY

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:58.517 region:rollup2
THE WAY SHE HERSELF WAS AN

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:59.785 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT AND BY DOING SO SHE

02:20:58.517 --> 02:21:01.687 region:rollup2
AVOIDED A CONVICTION FOR

02:20:59.785 --> 02:21:04.189 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHICH ALLOWED

02:21:01.687 --> 02:21:04.690 region:rollup2
HER TO NOT BE DEPORTED AND STAY

02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:05.457 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER

02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:08.493 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

02:21:05.457 --> 02:21:10.128 region:rollup2
SO I DISAGREE THAT THE THE

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:12.364 region:rollup2
STATUTE AS THE BILL AS IS

02:21:10.128 --> 02:21:14.833 region:rollup2

DEFENSE TURNS ARE NOT DOING THIS

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:08.013 region:rollup2

02:23:42.881 --> 02:23:46.618 region:rollup2

IMPLICIT.

02:23:46.618 --> 02:23:49.955 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

02:23:48.086 --> 02:23:53.191 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITH.

02:23:49.955 --> 02:23:55.093 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE THAT PUTTING AN

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:56.895 region:rollup2
ACTUAL AFFIRMATIVE BRADY

02:23:55.093 --> 02:24:00.465 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION INTO THIS BILL JUST

02:23:56.895 --> 02:24:01.132 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT

02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:01.766 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION EXISTS.

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:02.434 region:rollup2

THE BILL IT ALMOST IMPLIES THAT

02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:04.002 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT DOESN'T EXIST

02:24:02.901 --> 02:24:06.104 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:06.104 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK BRADY IS WHAT IT IS

02:24:06.171 --> 02:24:08.139 region:rollup2
TO BE DISCOVERED IF THERE ARE

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:08.807 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THAT HAPPENING

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.474 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S A BROADER ISSUE THAT

02:24:08.807 --> 02:24:10.308 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I DON'T

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:10.775 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BILL IS THE VEHICLE

THAT WAS THE SITUATION THAT

NOT BY THAT MUCH

02:29:03.067 --> 02:29:06.137 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD NOW IS THAT

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:07.939 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS MUST BE FOUND TO BE

02:29:06.137 --> 02:29:09.541 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED FOR A PERSON TO BE

PLACED ON THE LIST.

02:29:09.541 --> 02:29:12.877 region:rollup2
BUT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE

02:29:10.742 --> 02:29:14.779 region:rollup2
HUMPHREYS IN THAT CASE HAD BEEN

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:16.247 region:rollup2
FOUND TO BE SUBSTANTIATED.

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:17.849 region:rollup2
AND THE LAW NOW PROVIDES THAT A

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:18.349 region:rollup2
PERSON HAS A HAS THE RIGHT TO A

02:29:17.849 --> 02:29:20.251 region:rollup2

WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE.

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:37.836 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CHANGES

02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:39.871 region:rollup2
ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROTECT

02:29:37.836 --> 02:29:41.706 region:rollup2
