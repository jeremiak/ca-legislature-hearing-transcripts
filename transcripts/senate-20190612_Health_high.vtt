TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER.

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:56.480
IN PARTICULAR THE AREAS OF THOSE

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.716
TRANSFERS WHEN A CHILD IS PLACED

RESPONSIBILITY AND HERE'S WHAT

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.252

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:36.387
THOSE CHANGES IN THE BILL ARE

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.989

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:49.166
DOES I THINK DO A BETTER JOB NOW

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:50.801
OF REFLECTING WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:52.203

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:56.007
WE'VE LOST A LOT OF GROUP HELP

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.341
GROUP CARE FACILITIES AND THAT

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:59.310
WAS EXPECTED ON THE LOWER LEVEL

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:01.712
HOMES WERE WERE WORKING TO FIND.

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:02.613
PLACES FOR THE CHILDREN OF

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.981
FAMILIES AND SO THEY'RE BETTER

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.316
ABLE TO BE SERVED IN THOSE AND

IT WAS AMENDED OUT THROUGH THE

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:03.440
PROCESS AND WE DO THINK THAT

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:04.875
THAT WOULD BE THE CORRECT FIX.

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.677
IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.979
HEARINGS THAT WE HAD ON TWELVE

SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED AS

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.617

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.081
AND SO THERE'S STILL AN

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.716
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT THAT WAY.

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:22.853
RATHER THAN A BLANKET EXEMPTION

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:24.788
FOR AS CHAIR TEEPEES I DO WANT

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.189
TO CORRECT SOMETHING.

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:27.924
THAT WAS SAID IS IT'S NOT AN

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:30.360
AUTOMATIC -- MOVE ONCE A CHILD

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:31.695
MOVED OUT OF COUNTY WE

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.230
INTENTIONALLY BUT THE LANGUAGE

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.197
IN THERE THAT HAS TO BE

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:36.366
CONSIDERED ON A CASE BY CASE

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.067
BASIS.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.068
SO THAT THE CHILD'S PLACEMENT

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:40.404
WORKER WHO KNOWS THE CHILD BEST.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.838
TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION WHERE'S

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.340
THE CHILD GOING WHAT ARE THE

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.475
CHILD'S NEEDS AND IS THIS A

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.010
REASON TO EXERCISE ONE OF THE

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.078
EXCEPTIONS.

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.746
THE EXCEPTIONS ONE OF THEM WAS

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.782
EXPLICITLY FOR SHORT TERM

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:52.949
PLACEMENTS IT SAYS THE YOUTH

00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:54.851
PLACEMENT IN A COUNTY OTHER THAN

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.652
THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:58.121
JURISDICTION IS EXPECTED TO LAST

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:00.056
FOR SIX MONTHS OR LESS WE PUT

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:00.657
THAT IN THERE FOR US HERE DE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:01.258
PIECE.

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:03.093
BUT ALL THE OTHERS COULD ALSO BE

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.628
APPLIED AND EXERCISE IF THE

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:07.230
COUNTY FEELS THAT IS NOT

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:07.964
APPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER THAT

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:11.501
CHILD.

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.170
AND THEY WANT TO TAKE.

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.237
SHIP OF THAT CHILD AS FAR AS THE

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:14.871
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY WERE

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.039
SAYING THAT THOSE EXCEPTIONS-THAT THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:16.640
CONCERN WE MOVE THEM BECAUSE

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:18.141
THESE ARE ISSUES CLINICALLY WHEN

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.309
A CHILD MOVES WE ALREADY BUILT

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:20.644
THAT INTO THE ORIGINAL BILL SO

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.179
WE'RE CONCERNED -- THAT WE'RE

00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:23.713
GOING DOWN THIS DIFFERENT

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:24.614
PATHWAY.

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.082
ALSO AT THIS BILLS ENACTED WE

00:51:26.149 --> 00:51:27.250
WOULD THEN HAVE THREE THINGS

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.952
THAT HAPPEN THAT THE PLACEMENT

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.020
WORKER WOULD HAVE TO KEEP TRACK

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.922
OF IF A CHILD IS MOVED OUT OF

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:34.024
PLACEMENT. SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE IS

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.659
STILL IN THE FACT THAT THAT.

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.928
IMPACTS AID TO DOCTOR KIDS AP

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.496
KIDS THEY GO DOWN ONE PATH WITH

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.465
ONE SET OF PAPERWORK.

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.200
THIS WOULD CREATE A SECOND.

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.734
PATHWAY WITH DIFFERENT PAPERWORK

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.236
AND A THIRD PATHWAY WITH

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.237
DIFFERENT PAPERWORK FOR THE KIDS

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.104
WHO ARE NOT IN EITHER THE

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.840
SITUATION SO THE COUNTY IS GOING

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:50.574
TO HAVE.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.042
AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN KEEPING

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.277
TRACK OF HIS GUN WHERE AND WHAT

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:58.114
PAPERWORK NEEDS TO BE ATTACHED

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:58.348
TO THEM.

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.816

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.855
THAT YOU WOULD STILL STILL SAY

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.823
OPPOSE SO IS THERE A PATH TO

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.192
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OKAY YES AND

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.327

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.380
WE HAVE HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:25.615
PANELS AND INSTITUTIONAL REVIW

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:26.616
BOARDS THAT ENSURE THAT

INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS.

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.588
AND BENEFITS OF TREATMENT THESE

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:32.856
ARE PROCESS THAT WE TRUST TO

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.657
PROTECT EVERY OTHER RESEARCH

PARTICIPANT AND A FULLY EXTEND

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:37.527
TO EIGHT DOLLARS.

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.195
REMOVING THE BAN ON COMPENSATION

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:40.263
ALLOWED A DONOR'S JUST LIKE

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.465
EVERY OTHER RESEARCH PARTICIPANT

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:43.433

CEDARS AND MACROSCOPIC I THINK

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:55.311
THAT'S BEEN CHANGED SO WE NOW I

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:58.515

ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH I DO

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.623
ON A DAILY BASIS HAS CLEARED

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.592

PATIENTS.

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:47.630
AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.365
COMPENSATION WE CANNOT OBTAIN

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.601
THE SITES TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:56.206

OVARIAN STIMULATION OVERSIGHT

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.242
RETRIEVAL ARE TIME CONSUMING AND

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.610
ARDUOUS THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:01.911
BOTH THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:06.115
CELL RESEARCH.

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.283
HAVE CONSIDERED THE ISSUE OF

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.118
COMPENSATION FOR DONOR AND HAVE

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.086
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.055
COMPENSATION IS WARRANTED AND

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:13.223
ETHICAL.

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.724
OUR ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.926
DOES NOT CHANGE ON THE END USE

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.595
OF THE DONATION WHETHER TO HELP

CREATE A FAMILY OR FOR RESEARCH.

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.066
BUT IN CALIFORNIA COMPENSATION

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.434
IS PROHIBITED ESSENTIALLY

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.135
CLOSING OFF RESEARCH WHICH COULD

RENOWNED SCIENTIST IN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.075
WE ARE ONE OF ONLY ONE OF THREE

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.544
STATES THAT HAVE SUCH A BAN.

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.845
ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESEARCH

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.914
GUIDELINES ALL RESEARCH

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.716

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.084
THEIR TIME TROUBLE AND

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.752

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD WHOSE

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.527
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:53.096
PROTECT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS

FROM UNDUE RISK AND INFLUENCE.

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.433
IT IS ALSO THE JOB OF THESE

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.769
BOARDS TO SET COMPENSATION FOR

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:01.271
RESEARCH SUBJECTS THERE'S NO

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.872
REASON THIS WELL ESTABLISHED

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.474
POLICY OF OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.643
DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN WHO DONATE --

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.777
SITES TO SCIENCE.

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.579

INVOLVES REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.016

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:16.786
THAT IS COMPOSED OF SCIENTISTS

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:19.055
ETHICISTS AND LAY PERSONS.

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.957
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE SOLE

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.292
REASON THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:23.893
SCIENCE DID NOT RECOMMEND

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.161
COMPENSATION IN THE ORIGINAL

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.297
GUIDELINES WAS OUT OF POLITICAL

YEARS.

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.953
LAST YEAR THIS PROCEDURE WAS

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:53.556
PERFORMED IN OVER ONE POINT FIVE

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.724
MILLION WOMEN GLOBALLY.

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.225
XIN INDUCTION STRATEGIES ARE

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:57.994
THOUGHT TO ALL BUT ELIMINATE THE

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.429
RISK OF OVARIAN STIMULATION

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.898
SYNDROME AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.866
RETRIEVING TEN TO TWENTY AEGS

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:06.269

STUDIES REGARDING CANCER RISK

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.675
HAVE BEEN LARGELY REASSURING.

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.610
AND THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.945

OVARIAN OR UTERINE CANCER.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.749
LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP IS

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.684
OBVIOUSLY DESIRABLE AND IS PART

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.186
OF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND A JOINT

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.587

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.963
LET ME JUST ALSO ADD -- THAT

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.698
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:37.700
LOW INCOME WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR

THIS RESEARCH.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.138
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.506
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.241
IN FACT THE TWO STATES CURRENTLY

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.443

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:00.857
DIFFERENT.

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.577
USUALLY BEING PAID DIRECTLY BY

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:28.911
THE PATIENT.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.213
RIGHT NOW PATIENTS NEEDS TO

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.581
INJECT THEMSELVES THAN TO

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:32.582
FIFTEEN HOME INJECTIONS BEFORE

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.916
THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THE

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.418
PROCEDURE ITSELF.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.652
A DECENT INJECTIONS CAN BE

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.054
UNPLEASANT I RESULTING IN

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.623
UNUSUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BLOATING

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:41.824
AND SWELLING.

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.059
WHY THE FREQUENCY FOR VERY HIGH

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.093
PROCEED STIMULATION SYNDROME HAS

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.597
BEEN ACCUSED -- I DO TO ADVANCE

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:48.965
IN THE FIELD THERE IS PROMISING

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.267
RESEARCH WHERE WE CAN ELIMINATE

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.668
THESE RISKS ALTOGETHER.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.604

BORN OVER FORTY YEARS AGO.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:58.808
HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF

01:02:58.875 --> 01:02:59.942
BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENTIFIC

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.677
RESEARCH.

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:03.479
THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WE CAN DO

FOR THROUGH THE TREATMENT

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.517
RESEARCH IS CURRENTLY BEING SOLD

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.052
IN CALIFORNIA -- DUE TO LACK OF

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.152
ONE OF THE CONCERNS SOMEWHERE

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.520
ALONG THE LINE THAT WAS RAISED

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.789
AS THE IMPACT ON WELL WOMEN OF

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.558
COLOR -- I WOULD ADD TO THAT

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:25.027
POOR WOMEN -- ARE THERE ANY I'M

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.362

GOING TO SUPPORT HOWEVER ARE

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:29.332
THERE ANY.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:33.369
MEASURES NOW OR DATA SYSTEMS NOW

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:34.570
THEY COLLECT THAT KIND OF

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:37.440
INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T WAIT.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.408
UNTIL AND RAIN IF THERE EVER WAS

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:41.978
AN ABUSEOF THAT PARTICULARLY

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.879
IMPACTED POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:46.082
COLOR.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.883
SO THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME A

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.652
AND IT IS STILL A COUPLE THINGS.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.753
ONE WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR SUNSET

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.489
ON THE BILL SO THAT IF THERE IS

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.291
AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL BE A GREAT.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.525
REST BUT FURTHERMORE WE FOUND

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:58.060
STUDIES FROM COLUMBIA BOTH THE

01:04:58.127 --> 01:04:59.795
NEW YORK AND CITIES IN OREGON

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.430
SHOWING THAT THE BULK OF THE

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:04.000
PEOPLE PARTICIPATING OVER 454%

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:04.500
IN.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:07.303
NEW YORK OR CAR OCCASION AND 86%

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:10.139
AND HARD AGAIN WERE CAUCASIAN --

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:11.841
THIS IS ALL IT'S IT IT'S A LONG

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.276
PROTOCOL OF THIS IS NOT A SHORT

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.410
THIS IS NOT A SHORT BURST OF

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:17.747
MONEY THIS IS NOT A MAN GOING IN.

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:18.481
FOR A HOWEVER WE SAID TWENTY

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.283
MINUTES BUT WHATEVER HOWEVER

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:21.484
LONG.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.352
GOING INTO DO THEIR PORTION THIS

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.488
IS AN ARDUOUS PROCESS THAT --

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.656
TAKES TIME.

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.291
OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE AND OUT OF

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.192
YOUR OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND SO IT

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.927
IS NOT THIS IS NOT A QUICK BURST

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:33.829
OF MONEY AND I THINK THAT THAT.

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.231
THE CONCERN FROM THOSE WHO ARE --

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:39.468
LESS EDUCATED ON HOW THIS

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.170
PROCESS REALLY WORKS.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.538
MIGHT I ALSO ADD THAT ALL OF THE

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.673
INSTITUTIONAL READ REVIEW BOARDS

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.675
COLLECT DATA ON RACE AND

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.044
ETHNICITY OF PATIENTS --

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.479
SUBJECTS -- IT DOESN'T COLLECT

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.615
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THAT

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.617
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.185
THOSE OF US WHO DO RESEARCH CAN

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:57.720
DO BUT THEY DO COLLECT RACIAL

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.322
AND ETHNIC INFORMATION AND WE

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:00.790
HAVE TO SUBMIT.

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.091
CONSENT FORMS AND THOSE WHO'VE

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.659
CONSENTED AND THAT KIND OF

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:07.463
SUMMARY DATA ON A YEARLY BASIS.

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.531
WELL I WOULD ESPECIALLY IF.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.966
YOU KNOW THERE'S A A SUNSET I

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.735
WOULD REALLY URGE THAT THERE

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:15.037
HAVE BEEN TOO MANY TIMES -- THAT

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.439
POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:20.309
ARE ABUSED -- IN MEDICINE AND

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:24.113
ITS SYSTEMIC -- SO IT REALLY YOU

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.315
KNOW WATCH OUT FOR THAT RAIN AND

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.616
MAYBE GET YOU KNOW ON A

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:30.653
VOLUNTARY SINCE WE'RE NOT GOING

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.120
TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT.

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:32.922
BUT BEGIN TO GATHER THAT VERY

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.323
EXPLICIT INFORMATION BECAUSE I

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.059
THINK INCOME LEVELS ARE.

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.462
ALSO HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND NOT

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:42.998
JUST -- ETHNICITY THANK YOU AND

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:43.532
I WOULD AGREE IT'S A VITAL

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.134
QUESTION.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.168
SENATE MITCHELL.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.970
I WOULD JUST THINK THAT THAT I'M

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.105
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.873
ARGUMENT -- TO MY COLLEAGUE I

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.708
THINK IN THIS INSTANCE -- WOMEN

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.243
OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN -- HAVE

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.978
THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:57.413
ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AS WELL

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.314
AND SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT THEM

01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:59.782
EXPLOIT IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.151
THAT -- ALL DESCRIPTORS ARE

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:03.386
WRITTEN IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SO

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.721
EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM TAKING

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.890
ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM -- I I

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.693
KNOW SOME OF THE THE WE PAY TO

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.161
WRITE SOCIAIS SINCE I TYPICALLY

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.863
LINE WITH -- LATINAS

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.064
REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND OTHERS

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:16.432
ARE IN OPPOSITION BUT I THINK I

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:17.833
ALSO DON'T WANT TO CREATE.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:23.005
A A EIGHT DIFFERENT EXPECTATION

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:25.241
WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.409
HAVE THE RIGHT.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:27.276
ALL THEIR BODIES JUST LIKE

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:27.877
EVERYBODY ELSE I THINK THAT'S

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:28.744
THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I WOULD

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.146
TAKE ON IT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.515
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS -- AND

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:33.949
NOT ASSUME THAT POOR WOMEN ARE

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.886
GOING -- TO EXCESSIVELY UTILIZE

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:37.987
IT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THEIR

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:42.291
ACHES.

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.693
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY SO I I

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.162
JUST -- THAT WHAT THAT SOME

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.263
NUMBER GOING THANK YOU FOR

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.963
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.731
KNOW THIS.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.366
TOPIC THAT WAS INVOLVED IN A

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:51.934
DEBATE IN THIS INTERNALLY WITHIN

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.235
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.703
ABOUT THE SAY THAT CERTAINLY THE

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.238
ISSUES OF EXPLOITATION WERE

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:58.641
BROUGHT UP BUT I ALSO WANT TO

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:01.010
BRING -- POINT OUT THAT -- AND

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:01.677
ONE REASONS I'D WANT TO LOOK AT

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.412
THE DATA IS ACTUALLY THE OTHER

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:06.449
WAY AROUND -- TO OFF AND WE

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.217
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REPRESENTATION

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.552
BY WOMEN OVERALL THOUGH

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.654
CERTAINLY THIS RESEARCH ALLEN

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.189
WE'VE SEEN REPORTS ABOUT THAT.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.157
AND ALSO -- SURREALISM MCCARTY

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:16.358
MYSELF.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:17.827
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RESEARCH IS

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.361
ONLY DONE IN NON MINORITY

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.797
POPULATIONS AND THEN APPLY TO US

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:23.632
THEN THAT'S PROBLEMATIC AS WELL

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:25.701
SO -- THERE'S A REASON YOU HAVE

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.102
AN I. R. B. HAD -- INSTITUTIONAL

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.271
REVIEW BOARD -- AS A RESEARCHER

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.340
IT HAD TO HAVE MY A TUG OF WAR

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.708
WITH THE I. R. B. ABOUT WHAT

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.410
THEY WANT AND DEMAND AND

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.778
ACTUALLY THEY CAN REQUIRE I MEAN

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.380
WE CAN I CAN ARGUE BUT THEY WILL

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:43.452
REQUIRE. TO BE SURE THAT THAT IS.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:44.553
TODAY PERFECT NO -- BUT

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.554
CERTAINLY THEY'RE VERY THOROUGH

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.655
AND I KNOW THAT EVERY RB I EVER

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:47.656
WORKED WITH DEFINITELY IT IS

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:48.657
FIGHTING FOR ON BEHALF OF THE

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.059
PATIENT I MEAN THAT MAY NOT

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.093
