00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:06.725 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:07.726 region:rollup2
AGO THIS COUNTRY BECAME THE

00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:09.327 region:rollup2
BIRTHPLACE OF THE FREE WORLD

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:11.329 region:rollup2
THAT WORLD WAS BUILT UPON THE

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:13.031 region:rollup2
REVOLUTIONARY IDEA THAT ALL

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:15.734 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE CREATED EQUAL. AND

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:16.768 region:rollup2

COURSE BEING FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

00:32:18.637 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA WE

HAVE SEEN A BIT OF A CHANGE IN

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.276 region:rollup2
THAT PERSPECTIVE THE PLACE THAT

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:25.911 region:rollup2
ONCE PRIDED ITSELF AS THE LAND

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:27.512 region:rollup2

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:29.014 region:rollup2
ABANDONED THOSE VALUES FOR

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.248 region:rollup2
INTOLERANCE

00:32:29.014 --> 00:32:31.683 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT HAVE TO LOOK MUCH

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:33.185 region:rollup2
FURTHER THAN WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:34.886 region:rollup2
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:36.488 region:rollup2
TOO MANY STUDENTS CONSISTENTLY

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.355 region:rollup2
FEAR SPEAKING THEIR MINDS

00:32:36.488 --> 00:32:38.924 region:rollup2
BECAUSE COLLEGES AND

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:40.492 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES HAVE FAILED TO

00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:41.626 region:rollup2
UPHOLD AND PROTECT THEIR RIGHT

00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:42.794 region:rollup2

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.095 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN HARASSED THEY

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.964 region:rollup2

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:48.400 region:rollup2
ASSAULTED BY OTHER STUDENTS FOR

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:50.702 region:rollup2
BEING PART OF A PARTICULAR CLUB

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.437 region:rollup2
OR HAVING A CERTAIN OPINION.

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:54.139 region:rollup2
COURT YARDS IN GYMNASIUMS HAVE

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:55.707 region:rollup2
BEEN DAMAGING EVEN LET ON FIRE

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:56.708 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:58.143 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE EMOTIONAL

00:32:56.708 --> 00:33:00.178 region:rollup2
MATURITY TO LISTEN TO THE

00:32:58.143 --> 00:33:01.847 region:rollup2
OPINION OF ANOTHER THE HAPPENS

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:02.481 region:rollup2
TO DIFFER FROM THEIRS.

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:04.282 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SILENCED BY

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:05.283 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN PROFESSORS

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:07.352 region:rollup2

THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION.

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:13.792 region:rollup2
AND THE RESPONSE OF THEIR

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:15.260 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ADMINISTRATORS HAS BEEN

00:33:13.792 --> 00:33:15.894 region:rollup2

I SEND MY KIDS TO COLLEGE

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:24.516 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS LATER UC BERKELEY WAS

00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:25.917 region:rollup2
ON FIRE BECAUSE MY YET OPPOSITE

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:27.986 region:rollup2
THIS WAS WRITTEN AS AND A

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.720 region:rollup2
NATIONAL POLICY TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:30.021 region:rollup2
CAMPUS FREE SPEECH CRISIS.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.056 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUELY SHOWN

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:33.191 region:rollup2
WHY IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:34.659 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO STAND IN FIRM

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:36.061 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF FREE EXPRESSION ON

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.762 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:38.830 region:rollup2
WE WE DON'T THE WHOLE POINT OF

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.465 region:rollup2
HAVING FOR FREE SPEECH

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.667 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION

00:36:40.465 --> 00:36:44.669 region:rollup2
IS TO PROTECT IDEAS THAT ARE

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:46.738 region:rollup2
UNPOPULAR. WE DON'T NEED A FIRST

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:48.273 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT FOR IDEAS THAT WE ALL

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:49.974 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH WE NEED TO PROTECT

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:52.610 region:rollup2
MINORITY VIEWS NOT EVEN AND

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:53.144 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE VIEWS ARE

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.146 region:rollup2
REPULSIVE TO MOST PEOPLE.

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:56.881 region:rollup2
I'D.

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:58.349 region:rollup2
THE IT AND WE LOSE OUT IF WE

00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:00.385 region:rollup2
SILENCE OPINIONS THEY'RE WRONG

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:01.886 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE LOSE WHAT MILL CALLED

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:03.488 region:rollup2
THE CLEARER PERCEPTION AND

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.489 region:rollup2
LIVELIER IMPRESSION OF TRUTH

00:37:03.488 --> 00:37:05.757 region:rollup2
PRODUCED BY ITS COLLISION WITH

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.325 region:rollup2
ERROR.

00:37:05.757 --> 00:37:08.526 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY RESTORING

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:10.195 region:rollup2
FREE EXPRESSION AS A LIVING

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:12.630 region:rollup2
TRADITION ON CAMPUS AND THAT'S

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:14.399 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT THIS BILL A. B.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.767 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTY ONE ACCOMPLISHES.

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.035 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES WORKING IN

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:18.536 region:rollup2
WISCONSIN WHERE THE REGIONS HAVE

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:20.805 region:rollup2
ADOPTED IT ITS WORKING IN NORTH

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:22.107 region:rollup2
CAROLINA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:24.275 region:rollup2
ADOPTED AT. AND WOULD MAKE

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:25.543 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ITS COMMITMENT TO

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:27.612 region:rollup2
FREE EXPRESSION STRONGER.

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:30.482 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:32.817 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBLEMS SUGGESTED BY

00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:34.419 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:35.720 region:rollup2
IT'S A NICE STATE FUNDING ONLY

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:37.288 region:rollup2
FOR UNIVERSITIES THAT IGNORE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.856 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SAID

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.758 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:42.026 region:rollup2
EXPRESSION.

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:44.095 region:rollup2
AND IT ELIMINATES ONLY ARBITRARY

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:45.597 region:rollup2
FREE SPEECH ZONES AND SO UP FOR

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:47.532 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE PIERCE COLLEGE IN LOS

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:49.000 region:rollup2
ANGELES WERE STUDENT WAS.

00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:50.235 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE FOR HAND OUT COPIES

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.536 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE HE

00:37:50.235 --> 00:37:53.271 region:rollup2
WAS NOT IN THE DESIGNATED%

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.305 region:rollup2
POSTAGE STAMP SIZE FREE SPEECH

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.974 region:rollup2
ZONE.

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:57.008 region:rollup2
AND SEVEN STATES HAVE ALREADY

00:37:55.974 --> 00:37:58.676 region:rollup2
GOTTEN RID OF THESE THESE FREE

00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:01.379 region:rollup2
SPEECH ZONES THAT RESULT IN

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:03.782 region:rollup2
NEEDLESS LITIGATION. I END AND

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:05.750 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE. THAT LITIGATION IN

00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:07.118 region:rollup2
ORDER TO TO PROTECT THAT THE

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.086 region:rollup2
SIMPLE RIGHTTO HAND OUT A

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.587 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION OR HAVE OR HAVE A

00:38:08.086 --> 00:38:11.356 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS

00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:14.159 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS TO CHARGE STUDENT

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:15.693 region:rollup2
SECURITY FEES.

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.061 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NOT ALLOW THOSE

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:19.097 region:rollup2
SECURITY FEES TO BE BASED ON THE

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:20.165 region:rollup2
VIEWPOINT OF AN INVITED SPEAKER

00:38:19.097 --> 00:38:22.934 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS BLACK LETTER

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:24.335 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ALREADY. BUT

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:27.205 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA IT

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:29.140 region:rollup2
IT IS ROUTINELY IGNORED OR. TO

00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:30.942 region:rollup2
BE TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTOOD BY

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.976 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS AND AGAIN RESULTS

00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:32.977 region:rollup2
IN ME LISTEN EXPENSIVE

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:35.814 region:rollup2
LITIGATION

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:37.081 region:rollup2
BUT THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT.

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:38.349 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:40.285 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS FROM CANCELING

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:42.821 region:rollup2
EVENTS FOR LEGITIMATE CONCERT

00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:45.256 region:rollup2
SECURITY CONCERNS BUT IT DOES

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:46.558 region:rollup2
PREVENT. ABOUT CANCELING EVENTS

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:38:46.558 --> 00:38:49.928 region:rollup2
DISAGREES WITH THE VIEWPOINT OF

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.896 region:rollup2
THE SPEAKER OR BECAUSE THE

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:52.897 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT. THE

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:54.732 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WILL HAVE A STRONG

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:57.335 region:rollup2
REACTION TO THE SPEAKER THOSE

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:58.536 region:rollup2
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL REASONS FOR

00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
FOR CANCELING A SPEECH.

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:01.739 region:rollup2
AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:02.373 region:rollup2
ALLOWED THOSE REASONS TO BE THE

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.241 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.776 region:rollup2
POINTS TO.

00:39:03.241 --> 00:39:06.544 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE

00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:08.780 region:rollup2
THE BILL BALANCES RELIGIOUS

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:10.615 region:rollup2
LIBERTY WITH FREE SPEECH RIGHTS

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.950 region:rollup2
AS THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US

00:39:10.615 --> 00:39:14.319 region:rollup2
TO DO BY PUTTING BOTH THOSE

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.753 region:rollup2
RIGHTS IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:17.288 region:rollup2
SO IT IN SOME THE BILL IS

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:18.489 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:20.225 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYONE FOR INVITED

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.759 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS.

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:23.695 region:rollup2
PROTESTERS WHO WANT TO PRESENT

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:24.596 region:rollup2
AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:26.097 region:rollup2
AFTER YOU WERE KNIFE WE FIND

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:27.632 region:rollup2
OURSELVES ON CAMPUS HAVING A

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.933 region:rollup2
HEATED DISCUSSION.

00:39:27.632 --> 00:39:30.602 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:32.437 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT A

00:39:30.602 --> 00:39:37.041 region:rollup2
BATTLE OF IDEAS AND THAT'S WHAT

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:38.876 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TRIES TO PROTECT.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:39.744 region:rollup2
AYE WELL BEFORE I BEGIN MY BRIEF

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.179 region:rollup2
REMARKS AT FIRST LIKE TO EXPRESS

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.513 region:rollup2
MY APPRECIATION TO COMMITTEE FOR

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:43.948 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY REPRESENT THE

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:45.450 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF MY PEERS.

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:47.385 region:rollup2
I'M NOT EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.254 region:rollup2
THAT FREE SPEECH IS ON LIFE

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:50.255 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AT UC BERKELEY.

00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:51.422 region:rollup2
THE GENESIS OF THE FREE SPEECH

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:53.391 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT HAS SINCE DISINTEGRATED

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:53.958 region:rollup2
INTO AN AYE LOGICAL ECHO CHAMBER

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.926 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE WHO CONSERVE YOUR

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:56.661 region:rollup2
POINTS.

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:57.595 region:rollup2
ARE STOCKED HARASSED AND

00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:59.497 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES EVEN BEATEN AS A

00:39:57.595 --> 00:40:01.666 region:rollup2

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:10.141 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED THE SAME TREATMENT

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:11.576 region:rollup2

MEDIA OUTLETS.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.446 region:rollup2
SHOCKING MOMENT WHEN TWO MEN

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.381 region:rollup2
VICIOUSLY ATTACKED THE TRUMP

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:18.082 region:rollup2

THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE TAXI

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.635 region:rollup2
OF EXPERIENCE ON CAMPUS I DO NOT

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:38.770 region:rollup2
FEEL SAFE ON MY OWN CAMPUS. AND

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.104 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF OUR POLITICAL

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.539 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES I HOPE THAT WE CAN

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:43.374 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT VIOLENCE INTIMIDATION

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:45.243 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT REPLACE DEBATE AND

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:46.411 region:rollup2
DISCOURSE.

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:46.978 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AYE AYE I DID ONLY

00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:47.445 region:rollup2

OUR GOAL WAS SERVE BY STUDENTS A

MYSELF. THIS WAS THE SCENE WHEN

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.613 region:rollup2
A PROM CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:23.581 region:rollup2
WAS SET TO SPEAK AT UC BERKELEY

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:25.116 region:rollup2
BUT WAS ULTIMATELY SHUT DOWN

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:26.317 region:rollup2
THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.

00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:28.252 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT NIGHT THAT

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.287 region:rollup2
ONLY FAIR VIEW POINTS MAY BE

SUPPORTING A SAY MILO.

00:46:58.149 --> 00:46:59.817 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE OTHERS

00:46:58.783 --> 00:47:01.318 region:rollup2
WHO THINK THAT IS NOT

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:05.489 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SO AN EXAMPLE IS

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:07.858 region:rollup2
TONIGHT IN THE FULLERTON CITY.

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:16.801 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSY ALL WE ALREADY KNOW

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:19.670 region:rollup2

YELL OUT THOSE ARE ALL PROTOCOL

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:33.451 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON EACH COUNCIL BUT

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:35.720 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THAT THIS IS TAKING

00:47:33.451 --> 00:47:37.922 region:rollup2
OFF IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND PEOPLE

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.492 region:rollup2
ARE BEING BUSTED ON BOTH SIDES

00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:44.028 region:rollup2

IMMIGRATION AND THEN YOU MIGHT

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:51.602 region:rollup2

WE ARE IN A VERY VERY POLARIZED.

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:11.555 region:rollup2
OF.

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:14.392 region:rollup2
SCENARIO IN OUR COUNTRY NOW MORE

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:15.993 region:rollup2
THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:17.828 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN EVEN TELL YOU AS A

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:19.463 region:rollup2
CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN FULLER

OVER AND OVER I'VE HAD THE

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:36.247 region:rollup2

DO THAT I THINK. MANY WAYS ON

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:45.623 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WE HAVE

00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:48.559 region:rollup2
SOME REALLY REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES

00:48:45.623 --> 00:48:51.162 region:rollup2
OF HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR THAT UP

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:53.597 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKES BOTH SIDES OF. THAT

00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S BURNING OR FIRES AT

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:57.601 region:rollup2
WORK OR ATTACK WE CAN SEE THAT

00:48:55.166 --> 00:49:00.271 region:rollup2
ON BOTH SIDES I KNOW WATCHING

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:01.572 region:rollup2
THINGS LIVE. ONE I'VE SEEN IF

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.840 region:rollup2

VIOLENCE THAT'S THE LAST THING I

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.982 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE AND I'M SURE THAT'S

00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:13.117 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING WHEN YOU'VE WON

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:14.485 region:rollup2
TRUMP WAS DOING HIS BIG

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:16.187 region:rollup2
POLITICAL SPEECH IF YOU SAW

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:17.922 region:rollup2

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:24.695 region:rollup2
I DO THINK FREE SPEECH IS

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.298 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:29.600 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO UP MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:31.669 region:rollup2
ALL OF US CAN ENGAGE CHEN BUT.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.337 region:rollup2
.

00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:35.239 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCENARIOS

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.840 region:rollup2
CAL STATE FULLERTON IS MY PRIME

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:38.209 region:rollup2

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:44.415 region:rollup2
I GUESS CHATTER AND CONCERN

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:47.284 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PRESIDENT AGREED TO UP

00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:48.352 region:rollup2
LET THAT SPEAKER COME AND

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT WERE

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:52.756 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS THAT WERE SET UP.

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:55.860 region:rollup2
THAT AND ENDED UP LEADING THE

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:57.228 region:rollup2
EVENT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT A SOME

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.396 region:rollup2
OF THE CONCERNS AND I THINK

00:49:57.228 --> 00:50:01.165 region:rollup2
BERKELEY WAS THE EXAMPLE OF WE

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:04.335 region:rollup2

IF YOU COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING

FEAR HAS BEEN ESCALATION AND

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:36.146 region:rollup2

.

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.848 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WERE A BIT SURPRISING

00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:28.652 region:rollup2
TO ME BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MANY

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:29.152 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UC'S I'M

00:56:28.652 --> 00:56:30.854 region:rollup2
THE CSU SYSTEM YOU SEE

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:33.257 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY WERE

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:35.259 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL ON THIS ISSUE SO.

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:37.027 region:rollup2
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN THEY'RE

00:56:35.259 --> 00:56:38.595 region:rollup2
LOBBYIST COMES FORWARD AND WITH

00:56:37.027 --> 00:56:40.063 region:rollup2

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:43.066 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN MY

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:44.468 region:rollup2
OFFICE BUT. BE THAT AS IT MAY.

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:46.637 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:56:44.468 --> 00:56:47.871 region:rollup2
I I THINK DOCTOR FRENCH AND AND

00:56:46.637 --> 00:56:51.909 region:rollup2
NOW WE'D HEAR SHOULD HAVE A

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:53.310 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND SHE SEEMS.

00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:55.512 region:rollup2
I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HER

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.214 region:rollup2
TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM MY

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:59.182 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THERE AND PERHAPS YOU

00:56:57.214 --> 00:57:00.817 region:rollup2
CAN PASS THAT ON TO. AND DOES

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:02.452 region:rollup2
THE OTHER MEMBERS AT THE UC'S

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.488 region:rollup2
ADAM BOARD THAT WHAT EXACTLY IS

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:06.156 region:rollup2
GOING ON SO BUT I APPRECIATE

00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:07.824 region:rollup2

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:09.893 region:rollup2
AND EXPRESSED POINT OF VIEW.

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:10.894 region:rollup2
.

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:13.130 region:rollup2

WELL.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.366 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN SAY ALL DAY LONG THAT

00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:19.069 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH FREE

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:19.736 region:rollup2
SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THEY

00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:21.371 region:rollup2
CAN SAY THAT TO LOOKOUTS COME

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:22.306 region:rollup2
HOME IN THE DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:24.007 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT

00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:25.275 region:rollup2
TRUE. IT'S NOT ON EVERY CAMPUS

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:26.943 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME CAMPUSES ARE

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:28.178 region:rollup2
HANDLING THIS JUST FINE AND THEY

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.246 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY IN THE THEY HAVE

00:57:28.178 --> 00:57:30.414 region:rollup2
NO PROBLEMS.

00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:32.449 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER CAMPUS CAMPUSES

00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:34.184 region:rollup2
LIKE UC BERKELEY THEY'RE HAVING

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:35.352 region:rollup2
GREAT GREAT DIFFICULTY AT

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:36.553 region:rollup2
ALLOWING ALL STUDENTS TO

00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:36.787 region:rollup2
EXERCISE THEIR FREE SPEECH

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.588 region:rollup2
RIGHTS.

00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:40.991 region:rollup2

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:43.260 region:rollup2
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT

00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:44.194 region:rollup2

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.397 region:rollup2

YOUR CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN THIS

IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:53.503 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND THE LAST THING I

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:56.306 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO DO. IS PUT THEM

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:57.874 region:rollup2
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:59.609 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THEY SPEAK UP.

00:57:57.874 --> 00:58:01.211 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARMED

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:03.547 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:06.616 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARE.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:54.244 region:rollup2

I GUARANTEE TO OUR FREEDOM IN

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:22.772 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL SYNAGOGUE ON A FRIDAY

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.441 region:rollup2
NIGHT.

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:26.543 region:rollup2
DURING SERVICE THAT THEY WERE

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:27.477 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:31.247 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY HAD THE

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:33.450 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DO THAT.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:36.353 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE USING AN

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.486 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF OF A GROUP WHERE ARE

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:37.921 region:rollup2

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.122 region:rollup2
.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.590 region:rollup2
THAT I JUST VERY STRONGLY

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.592 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.327 region:rollup2

SAME GROUP WENT AND.

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:58.475 region:rollup2
.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:59.909 region:rollup2
PROTESTED IN FRONT OF THE.

DAY LABOR.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.382 region:rollup2
WHERE DAY LABORERS GATHER AND

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.816 region:rollup2
THE NEO* WENT TO?

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:08.285 region:rollup2

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:10.654 region:rollup2
PROTESTS THERE.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:12.856 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:14.024 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE CAME OUT ENCOUNTER

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.958 region:rollup2
PROTESTS BUT AGAIN.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.759 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ALLOWED.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.694 region:rollup2
TO

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:19.829 region:rollup2

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:27.003 region:rollup2
A IN IN THE CITY AND SO THEY

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:27.504 region:rollup2
SHOULD.

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:27.737 region:rollup2
I MAY DISAGREE WITH YOUR

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:28.772 region:rollup2
PREMISE.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.473 region:rollup2
THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:32.776 region:rollup2
IN DANGER.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:35.845 region:rollup2
IN OUR UNIVERSITIES CAMPUSES.

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:39.616 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE MAY JUST DISAGREE.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:41.551 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:42.252 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN AS AN EDUCATOR I

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.521 region:rollup2
BELIEVE AND.

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:46.489 region:rollup2
.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:48.224 region:rollup2
ALLOWING IN CLASSES.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:50.193 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF CLASSES FOR STUDENTS

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:51.895 region:rollup2
TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS AND

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:53.496 region:rollup2
DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU AND THE

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:55.932 region:rollup2
VALUE OF STUDENTS HEARING

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:59.536 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPINIONS.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:04:00.870 region:rollup2
BUT AS IT GOES TO THIS BILL.

01:03:59.536 --> 01:04:02.772 region:rollup2
I I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE IT'S

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.108 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR COLLEGES AND

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.875 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES TO ENSURE.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:07.043 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:09.979 region:rollup2
FREEDOM OF SPEECH I CAN'T

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:12.315 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:15.285 region:rollup2
THE REASON FOR I FIND THE BILL

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:17.087 region:rollup2
TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.388 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE OF ENACTED IT

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:20.557 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN TOO MANY

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:22.826 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:25.462 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IS NOT THE PRACTICE

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:28.732 region:rollup2
OF THIS COMMITTED TO PASS OUT TO

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:32.068 region:rollup2
BILLS. TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:33.937 region:rollup2
AND A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE'RE

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:36.473 region:rollup2
GONNA HEAR A. B. TWENTY THREE

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:37.474 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR. WHICH I FIND TO BE

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:39.876 region:rollup2
BETTER POLICY

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:40.777 region:rollup2
FOR APPROACHING.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:44.714 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING FREEDOMS SPEECH ON

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:48.752 region:rollup2
OUR CAMPUSES SO I WON'T AT THIS

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:49.619 region:rollup2
TIME BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL.

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:52.589 region:rollup2
MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU COULD

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:53.790 region:rollup2
CALL THE ROLL.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.224 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE A CORE.

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:04.000 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE A CORE.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.969 region:rollup2

.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.574 region:rollup2
AT AT FRESNO STATE WE REALLY DO

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:26.676 region:rollup2
HAVE EIGHTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:27.476 region:rollup2
WHO RELY PARTLY AT LEAST ON

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:30.012 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID ABOUT SIXTY

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:31.414 region:rollup2
PERCENT. WHO RELY ENTIRELY ON

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:33.616 region:rollup2

PAY FOR THEIR TUITION AND OTHER

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:38.154 region:rollup2
THINGS? I'M UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.922 region:rollup2
THEY RELY ON A SYSTEM THAT IS

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:41.090 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO. CONSISTENTLY

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.758 region:rollup2
DELIVER PAYMENTS ON TIME AND

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.492 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.927 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM FAILS THEM THEN

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:46.696 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STUCK OUT WITH BILLS

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:47.196 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T PAY AND SO WE HAVE TO

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.130 region:rollup2
FIND SOLUTIONS WHEN THAT

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.599 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.800 region:rollup2
UP THIS BILL WOULD OPEN A LINE

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.568 region:rollup2
OF CREDIT FOR STUDENTS AT THE

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.936 region:rollup2

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:57.540 region:rollup2
THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO SUCCEED

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.574 region:rollup2
IN CLASS OUT THIS WOULD ALLOW

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.609 region:rollup2
THEM TO NOT GET BEHIND IN CLASS

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:00.710 region:rollup2
IT WOULD. GET RID OF THOSE

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:01.811 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL WORRIES AND THAT

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:06.015 region:rollup2

INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.600 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:00.801 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS THAT IN THIS YEAR

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.769 region:rollup2

SO IF THERE'S NOT A WOMEN.

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:08.342 region:rollup2
AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY

DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS.

01:44:13.848 --> 01:44:16.717 region:rollup2
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND AND

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:18.185 region:rollup2
TO SHARE SOME FEEDBACK AND.

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:19.253 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE CONCERNS WITH THE

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:21.222 region:rollup2
BILL ONE POINT IS CLEARLY IT

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.789 region:rollup2
EXTENDS.

01:44:21.222 --> 01:44:23.357 region:rollup2
MOST OF OUR MANAGER OUTSIDE

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:24.592 region:rollup2
CALLS.

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:26.794 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE EXTENDING

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:28.729 region:rollup2
BEYOND OUR JURISDICTION AND THE

01:44:26.794 --> 01:44:30.397 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENT

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:31.832 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE CHALLENGING.

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.867 region:rollup2
AS POINTED OUT BY THE SPEAKERS

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:34.468 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TARGETS VENTURE

01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:36.370 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:37.838 region:rollup2
WHICH WE AGREE WITH THERE IS A

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:39.406 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM IN VENTURE CAPITAL

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:40.908 region:rollup2
VENTURE CAPITAL OF LESS THAN ONE

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:42.076 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:43.477 region:rollup2
AND ALL THOSE MANAGERS THIRTY

01:44:42.076 --> 01:44:45.713 region:rollup2
PERCENT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:47.248 region:rollup2
MINORITIES.

01:44:45.713 --> 01:44:49.917 region:rollup2
LET ME JUST CLOSE WITH SAYING

01:44:47.248 --> 01:44:51.585 region:rollup2
THAT TO BE CLEAR WE BELIEVE

01:44:49.917 --> 01:44:54.054 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY INCLUSION MATTERS.

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:55.055 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:56.056 region:rollup2
WERE AT THE LEADING EDGE AND WE

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.291 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE VERY

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:58.292 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.827 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:00.828 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THE PAST FOUR YEARS

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:02.263 region:rollup2
WE MANAGE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN

01:45:00.828 --> 01:45:04.064 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS WITH SIXTY

01:45:02.263 --> 01:45:05.599 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:07.101 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS PER INVESTMENT

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:08.569 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL VERSUS AN INDUSTRY

01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:10.838 region:rollup2
AVERAGE OF ONE WE DO ALL THAT

01:45:08.569 --> 01:45:11.672 region:rollup2
FOR THREE BASIS POINTS THAT ZERO

01:45:10.838 --> 01:45:13.974 region:rollup2
POINT ZERO THREE PER.

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:14.975 region:rollup2
I ONLY TELL YOU THAT.

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:16.577 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT THE COSTS ARE

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.212 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT'S A SMALL TEAM.

01:45:16.577 --> 01:45:19.413 region:rollup2
WE CAN COME TOGETHER AROUND

01:45:18.212 --> 01:45:20.014 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:21.348 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT OUR CULTURE AND OUR

01:45:20.014 --> 01:45:22.416 region:rollup2

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:15.989 region:rollup2
I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD.

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.556 region:rollup2
AND PREGNANT WITH MY DAUGHTER

02:03:15.989 --> 02:03:16.956 region:rollup2
WHEN ALL OF MY FRIENDS WERE

02:03:16.556 --> 02:03:18.758 region:rollup2
GOING TO COLLEGE.

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:19.292 region:rollup2
I COULDN'T GO BECAUSE COLLEGES

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.793 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE FACILITIES FOR

02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:22.262 region:rollup2
STUDENTS LIKE ME.

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:23.162 region:rollup2

THIS IS WHAT MAKES COMMUNITY

02:03:26.366 --> 02:03:28.134 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:28.668 region:rollup2
US THIS IS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:30.536 region:rollup2
OF US ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:03:28.668 --> 02:03:33.072 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES HOWEVER. IN MY

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:33.706 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OUR COMMUNITY

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.173 region:rollup2
COLLEGES DON'T REALLY GO OUT OF

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:35.708 region:rollup2
THEIR WAY.

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:38.111 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT OR.

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:38.645 region:rollup2
WELCOME STUDENTS LIKE ME.

02:03:38.111 --> 02:03:40.413 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET

02:03:38.645 --> 02:03:42.215 region:rollup2
LACTATION FACILITIES ON MY

02:03:40.413 --> 02:03:43.716 region:rollup2
CAMPUS FOR OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

02:03:42.215 --> 02:03:46.619 region:rollup2
AND DURING THIS PERIOD OF SPOKEN

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:47.754 region:rollup2
TO SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN A

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:49.355 region:rollup2
SMALL BREAK WHILE I NEED TO GIVE

02:03:47.754 --> 02:03:50.923 region:rollup2
BIRTH. AND THEN NOT COME BACK.

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:52.759 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:54.193 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T COME BACK

02:03:52.759 --> 02:03:55.194 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CAMPUS FACILITIES

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:59.299 region:rollup2
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

02:03:55.194 --> 02:04:00.800 region:rollup2
TO BE BOTH PARENTS AND STUDENTS.

02:03:59.299 --> 02:04:02.435 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.703 region:rollup2
OFFICE VERY SMALL CHANGE WITH AN

02:04:02.435 --> 02:04:04.504 region:rollup2
OUTSIZE IMPACT.

02:04:03.703 --> 02:04:05.605 region:rollup2
LACTATION FACILITIES ON CAMPUS

02:04:04.504 --> 02:04:06.506 region:rollup2
WOULD MEAN THAT THE STUDENTS

02:04:05.605 --> 02:04:09.008 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO STOP STUDYING IN

02:04:06.506 --> 02:04:09.676 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE.

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:11.244 region:rollup2
BUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL GOES

02:04:09.676 --> 02:04:12.712 region:rollup2
FURTHER THAN THAT. STUDIES HAVE

02:04:11.244 --> 02:04:14.247 region:rollup2
SHOWN THAT. THE MULTI

02:04:12.712 --> 02:04:16.416 region:rollup2
GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF COLLEGE

02:04:14.247 --> 02:04:17.250 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN

02:04:16.416 --> 02:04:18.718 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:22.522 region:rollup2
YOUNG AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN

02:04:18.718 --> 02:04:23.189 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

02:04:22.522 --> 02:04:23.723 region:rollup2
M. IF THESE WITH THE DISEASE HAD

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:24.557 region:rollup2
BEEN AVAILABLE WHEN I WAS

02:04:23.723 --> 02:04:26.025 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:27.093 region:rollup2
TO GO TO COLLEGE JUST LIKE

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:30.263 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE.

02:04:27.093 --> 02:04:31.464 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE.

02:04:30.263 --> 02:04:32.699 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS HAVE TO MAKE THIS

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:33.733 region:rollup2
CHANGE SO THE PARENTING STUDENTS

02:04:32.699 --> 02:04:35.768 region:rollup2
LIKE MYSELF DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT

02:04:33.733 --> 02:04:37.437 region:rollup2
FOR IT.

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:38.905 region:rollup2
I WORK MULTIPLE JOBS A STUDY

02:04:37.437 --> 02:04:40.673 region:rollup2
FULL TIME AND I MANAGEMENT

02:04:38.905 --> 02:04:42.141 region:rollup2
FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:43.743 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME AND

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:44.877 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF

02:04:43.743 --> 02:04:48.448 region:rollup2
TO FIGHT THESE BATTLES BUT

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:48.981 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY HAS TO.

02:04:48.448 --> 02:04:50.183 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THE PARENTS OF

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:50.817 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY

02:04:50.183 --> 02:04:53.052 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM THE SAME PRIVILEGE

02:04:50.817 --> 02:04:54.620 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:55.788 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.889 region:rollup2
WHERE TO LOOK WE DON'T FEEL

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:59.459 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE QUESTIONING THOSE IN

02:04:56.889 --> 02:05:01.194 region:rollup2
POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY?

02:04:59.459 --> 02:05:02.261 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR

02:05:01.194 --> 02:05:04.497 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:05.698 region:rollup2
RIDICULOUS FROM THIS SCHOOLS

02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:07.266 region:rollup2
TITLE MINOR UP LIKE I HAVE.

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:08.735 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CORNER

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:10.670 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT IN THE

02:05:08.735 --> 02:05:11.604 region:rollup2
HALLWAY AT TEMPLE HAIKAI DID.

02:05:10.670 --> 02:05:12.972 region:rollup2
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT SO

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:13.906 region:rollup2
HARD FOR FACILITIES WHICH WE

02:05:12.972 --> 02:05:17.910 region:rollup2

WHICH TO DO SOMETHING IT'S

02:07:27.907 --> 02:07:30.710 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY NATURAL AND

02:07:29.175 --> 02:07:32.478 region:rollup2
PHYSIOLOGICALLY NECESSARY.

02:07:30.710 --> 02:07:34.647 region:rollup2

WORKPLACE EQUITY FOR WOMEN THAT

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:50.463 region:rollup2

RIGHT HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:07:51.464 --> 02:07:54.467 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL WAYS THE HARDER YOU

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:55.868 region:rollup2
MAKE IT FOR PEOPLE TO COME BACK

02:07:54.467 --> 02:07:57.336 region:rollup2

WE PUT REQUIREMENTS.

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:14.754 region:rollup2
ON OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND WE

SOMEHOW TRY TO FACILITATE IT.

02:08:16.489 --> 02:08:19.659 region:rollup2

02:08:18.558 --> 02:08:21.294 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE I I HAVEN'T HEARD IT

02:08:19.659 --> 02:08:22.762 region:rollup2

AND THIS BILL THE RESULT OF THE

02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:37.442 region:rollup2
RESEARCH WERE ALSO.

02:23:35.874 --> 02:23:39.277 region:rollup2
WHERE ALSO IMPORTANT IN

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:40.512 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A BASELINE OF HOW

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:42.080 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WERE APPROACHING THESE

02:23:40.512 --> 02:23:44.549 region:rollup2
POLICY THE IMPACT THAT THIS?

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:46.151 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO REFORMS ASSOCIATED.

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:47.252 region:rollup2
LIKE THE ONE THAT JUST.

02:23:46.151 --> 02:23:48.453 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AND

COLLEAGUES HAVE STARTED TO WORK

02:23:48.453 --> 02:23:52.457 region:rollup2
ON SOME REFORM SO WE WANTED A

02:23:49.688 --> 02:23:53.358 region:rollup2
BASS LINE HOW COLLEGES ARE DOING

02:23:52.457 --> 02:23:55.760 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE CHANGE.

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:57.395 region:rollup2
SO UP NEXT TO SUMMARIZE US SOME

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:59.297 region:rollup2
OF ARMY FINDING. IT IN JUST A

02:23:57.395 --> 02:24:00.732 region:rollup2
REMINDER THE PRESENTERS THAT WE

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:02.167 region:rollup2
SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT. TO ME

02:24:00.732 --> 02:24:08.073 region:rollup2
TOO MANY.

02:24:02.167 --> 02:24:08.640 region:rollup2
SO JUST GIVE THE HIGHLIGHT IT.

02:24:08.073 --> 02:24:09.674 region:rollup2
AND IT DOES ENJOY SUPPORT.

02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:10.575 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:24:09.674 --> 02:24:10.876 region:rollup2
OKAY IT SO SO I ONE OF THE

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:12.644 region:rollup2
THINGS IS.

02:24:10.876 --> 02:24:13.912 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT COLLEGES ARE ARE

02:24:12.644 --> 02:24:15.480 region:rollup2
HEAVILY RELYING ON PLACEMENT

02:24:13.912 --> 02:24:16.848 region:rollup2
TESTS ON TO ASSESS SIMPLY

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.817 region:rollup2
STUDENTS INTO THE COLLEGE THE

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:20.352 region:rollup2
INTO COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES. I'M

02:24:18.817 --> 02:24:22.254 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH COLLEGES ARE

02:24:20.352 --> 02:24:24.055 region:rollup2
USING THE SAME TEST THE MAY BE

02:24:22.254 --> 02:24:25.857 region:rollup2
SETTING DIFFERENT CUT SCORES SO

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:27.058 region:rollup2
WHERE STUDENT GO AND ENDS UP IN

02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:28.293 region:rollup2
ROLENE LARGELY DETERMINES

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:29.461 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT A STUDENT IS

02:24:28.293 --> 02:24:31.062 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

02:24:29.461 --> 02:24:32.030 region:rollup2
TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES. AND WE

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:33.231 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT I'M STILL

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:34.099 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:36.501 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:38.169 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAD.

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:39.437 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE ACCESS TO

02:24:38.169 --> 02:24:41.673 region:rollup2
TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:43.575 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN MATH THAT JUST BY

02:24:41.673 --> 02:24:44.142 region:rollup2
VIRTUE OF ATTENDING COLLEGES

02:24:43.575 --> 02:24:45.443 region:rollup2
THAT SET HIGHER CUT SCORES.

02:24:44.142 --> 02:24:47.612 region:rollup2
.

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:49.147 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS LACK OF CONSISTENCY

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:50.615 region:rollup2
EVEN ONE COLLEGES USE THE SAME

02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:51.349 region:rollup2
TASK OF THE SAME MEASURES.

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:54.152 region:rollup2
HOW?

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:55.654 region:rollup2
IS IT'S VERY DETRIMENTAL

02:24:54.152 --> 02:24:56.555 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT IS

02:24:55.654 --> 02:24:57.756 region:rollup2
CONFUSING FOR A STUDENT ARE

02:24:56.555 --> 02:24:59.958 region:rollup2
ENROLLING IN ONE COLLEGE THAT

02:24:57.756 --> 02:25:00.825 region:rollup2
GOOD DEFINITION OF BEING COLLEGE

02:24:59.958 --> 02:25:02.494 region:rollup2
READY IS STIFF.

02:25:00.825 --> 02:25:03.828 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS A AND THIS IS

02:25:02.494 --> 02:25:05.163 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY A CRITICAL BECAUSE

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:06.731 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS

02:25:05.163 --> 02:25:08.600 region:rollup2
ENROLLING MORE THAN ONE COLLEGE.

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:10.001 region:rollup2
SO THEY MIGHT EVEN WITHIN THE

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.937 region:rollup2
THING DISTRICTS THEY MAY BE

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:13.505 region:rollup2
CONFRONTED BY DIFFERENT

02:25:11.937 --> 02:25:14.339 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EMPLACEMENTS.

02:25:13.505 --> 02:25:15.874 region:rollup2

THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:40:33.924 --> 02:40:37.795 region:rollup2
THERE IS A THERE IS A TENDENCY

02:40:36.427 --> 02:40:39.430 region:rollup2
FOR SOME STUDENTS TO TAKE NON

THAT WAS THE CASE FOR ME.

02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.236 region:rollup2

USE FINANCIALLY EARLIER YOU CAN

02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:55.613 region:rollup2

COMPLETE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:30.381 region:rollup2
WITHOUT POTENTIALLY CREATING. IT

02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:31.916 region:rollup2
IN THE OPPOSITE IN FACT.

02:41:30.381 --> 02:41:33.417 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK BECAUSE LOOK WE

02:41:31.916 --> 02:41:35.185 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED WITH THIS TO WRITE IN

02:41:33.417 --> 02:41:36.787 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MOST OF THE ARGUMENTS

02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:38.255 region:rollup2
THAT COME TOWARDS US WHAT WE

02:41:36.787 --> 02:41:39.089 region:rollup2
WERE DOING FREE COMMUNITY

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.391 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WE FACED.

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:41.525 region:rollup2
WE FACED SIMILAR ARGUMENTS WERE

02:41:40.391 --> 02:41:43.093 region:rollup2
FULL TWENTY TO PUSH US TO DO

02:41:41.525 --> 02:41:45.296 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN UNITS.

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:45.863 region:rollup2
PER SEMESTER IN ORDER DO FREE

02:41:45.296 --> 02:41:47.231 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE PUSHED

02:41:45.863 --> 02:41:48.966 region:rollup2
BACK.

02:41:47.231 --> 02:41:50.868 region:rollup2
ENDED TWELVE UNITS

02:41:48.966 --> 02:41:51.936 region:rollup2
THE SAME ARGUMENT WAS I'M

02:41:50.868 --> 02:41:53.404 region:rollup2
ASSUMING YOU'RE A AND THE

02:41:51.936 --> 02:41:54.338 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING ARGUMENT IS ONE TO

02:41:53.404 --> 02:41:56.273 region:rollup2
ONE INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO IT

02:41:54.338 --> 02:41:57.675 region:rollup2
SHORTER BY IT BY GIVING MORE

02:41:56.273 --> 02:41:59.410 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY IF IT WAS SHORTER.

02:41:57.675 --> 02:42:01.045 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE MAKING A LOT MORE

02:41:59.410 --> 02:42:01.912 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID YOU WOULD ACTUALLY

02:42:01.045 --> 02:42:01.912 region:rollup2
DECREASE SOMEBODY'S POSSIBILITY

02:42:02.313 --> 02:42:05.649 region:rollup2
OF.

02:42:05.716 --> 02:42:08.519 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF EDUCATION IN

02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:09.620 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS

02:42:08.519 --> 02:42:12.189 region:rollup2
THE GET SOMEBODY TO BE

02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:13.557 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL. AND IF THIS IS A

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:15.192 region:rollup2
TOOL THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE

02:42:13.557 --> 02:42:16.327 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY BELIEVE IT COMPLETE

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:18.562 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:42:16.327 --> 02:42:20.331 region:rollup2
I WOULD I WOULD USE THIS DATA

02:42:18.562 --> 02:42:21.732 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AYE ONE

02:42:20.331 --> 02:42:23.267 region:rollup2
WANTS TO MISS THE FALLOUT AND

02:42:21.732 --> 02:42:25.002 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE THE DANGER AND

02:42:23.267 --> 02:42:26.870 region:rollup2
NOT GIVING FREE COMMUNITY ONSITE

02:42:25.002 --> 02:42:28.939 region:rollup2
NOT DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:31.108 region:rollup2
FIGHT CALTRANS FOR US. FOR SIX

02:42:28.939 --> 02:42:32.776 region:rollup2
YEARS AND THE CASE IN POINT IS A

02:42:31.108 --> 02:42:34.511 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR USE FOR SIX YEARS.

02:42:32.776 --> 02:42:36.013 region:rollup2
.

02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:37.247 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANT TO LINE IT UP TO

02:42:36.013 --> 02:42:39.883 region:rollup2
TO STANDARDS THAT WE BELIEVE

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:40.517 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE A STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL.

02:42:39.883 --> 02:42:41.819 region:rollup2
OKAY AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING

02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:43.887 region:rollup2
TO.

02:42:41.819 --> 02:42:45.222 region:rollup2
OKAY JAMMIN MORE STUDENTS UP

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:46.490 region:rollup2
WITH MORE CLASSES.

02:42:45.222 --> 02:42:48.525 region:rollup2
OR TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO IT IN

02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:49.827 region:rollup2
A SHORTER AND SHORTER TIME FRAME

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:51.228 region:rollup2
ALL ULTIMATELY ENDS UP

02:42:49.827 --> 02:42:51.929 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HURT IN THE GREAT IF

02:42:51.228 --> 02:42:53.797 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HAVING TO RUSH TO

02:42:51.929 --> 02:42:55.332 region:rollup2
CLASSES. AND INSTEAD OF GETTING

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:56.634 region:rollup2
AN A YOU GET A BEER YOU GET TO

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:58.235 region:rollup2
SEE IN YOU ACTUALLY. YOU

02:42:56.634 --> 02:43:00.971 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DID TORAH STUDENTS

02:42:58.235 --> 02:43:02.406 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF GETTING IN THE IN

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:04.208 region:rollup2
A BETTER POST GRADUATE SCHOOL.

02:43:02.406 --> 02:43:04.742 region:rollup2
FOR GETTING INTO POSTGRADUATE

02:43:04.208 --> 02:43:07.177 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SO THERE'S A. WILL

02:43:04.742 --> 02:43:08.646 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WAY WE CAN CONTINUE ON

02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:10.114 region:rollup2
THE ARE ON ON THIS CONVERSATION.

02:43:08.646 --> 02:43:12.549 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY IF I TAKE A LOOK

02:43:10.114 --> 02:43:14.351 region:rollup2
AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR AN

02:43:12.549 --> 02:43:15.252 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM AS THE ULTIMATE

02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:17.054 region:rollup2
GOAL TO MAKE A STUDENTS

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:19.189 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL MAN MEANS COMPLETING

02:43:17.054 --> 02:43:20.991 region:rollup2
GRADUATING AND GOING ON. EITHER

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:21.925 region:rollup2
GET A JOB REPORTS GRADUATE AND I

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:23.961 region:rollup2
THINK THESE ARE.

02:43:21.925 --> 02:43:24.561 region:rollup2
GOOD TOOLS TO CONTINUE THAT YEAH

02:43:23.961 --> 02:43:27.264 region:rollup2
AND I I'M I. I APPRECIATE THE

02:43:24.561 --> 02:43:29.933 region:rollup2
AM.

02:43:27.264 --> 02:43:31.168 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AT THE. POINT YOU

02:43:29.933 --> 02:43:33.937 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING IS IF THE ARGUMENT

02:43:31.168 --> 02:43:35.272 region:rollup2
IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS WITH A

02:43:33.937 --> 02:43:37.107 region:rollup2
FREE TUITION AND THAT'S NOT MINE

02:43:35.272 --> 02:43:38.709 region:rollup2
AYE SPIES THAT MAY HAVE. FUNDS

02:43:37.107 --> 02:43:40.110 region:rollup2
AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE OPTIMALLY

02:43:38.709 --> 02:43:41.378 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING STUDENTS.

02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:43.213 region:rollup2
SO I APPRECIATE THAT PART THAT

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:44.481 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY JUST TO GIVE

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.683 region:rollup2
THEM AN INCENTIVE SOME OF THE

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:47.184 region:rollup2
POINTS YOU'VE RAISED ARE GOOD

02:43:45.683 --> 02:43:48.886 region:rollup2
ONES ARE JUST ONES THAT TO ME

02:43:47.184 --> 02:43:49.453 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO SPEED UP THE

02:43:48.886 --> 02:43:50.688 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THE STUDENT AND

02:43:49.453 --> 02:43:51.889 region:rollup2
MAKE.

02:43:50.688 --> 02:43:54.158 region:rollup2
MAKE IT ANY MORE LIKELY THAT

02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:55.559 region:rollup2
THEY CAN COMPETE ARE COMPLETE IN

02:43:54.158 --> 02:43:56.060 region:rollup2
THE TIME FOR ME THAT WE WOULD

WANT THEM TO.

02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:59.229 region:rollup2
AND

02:43:57.594 --> 02:44:00.230 region:rollup2
SPECIAL BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:01.632 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:03.667 region:rollup2
HOW CAMINO ABSOLUTE HELP THEM TO

COMPLETE MY CONCERN ALSO IS I I

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:07.471 region:rollup2
DO HAVE.

02:44:05.302 --> 02:44:09.740 region:rollup2
UP FIRST MUCH AS OF SUPPORTED

MORE INTO CAL GRANT THERE'S A

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:14.978 region:rollup2
LOT OF INEQUITIES IN THE CAL

GRANT WE STILL HAVE DEFECTS

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:18.849 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE.

02:44:16.547 --> 02:44:20.684 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

02:44:18.849 --> 02:44:21.552 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO FINISH AND

02:44:20.684 --> 02:44:24.354 region:rollup2
HAVE SUPPORT TO FINISH ON TIME

02:44:21.552 --> 02:44:24.688 region:rollup2
AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA AND

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.457 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE.

02:44:24.688 --> 02:44:28.859 region:rollup2
THE.

02:44:26.457 --> 02:44:30.227 region:rollup2
WHERE THE WHOLE IS RIGHT NOW

02:44:28.859 --> 02:44:31.895 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE MENTIONED

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:33.063 region:rollup2
YOUR GOOD POINTS WILL JUST DON'T

02:44:31.895 --> 02:44:35.099 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT HOLD THIS IS FILLING

02:44:33.063 --> 02:44:35.966 region:rollup2
LET ME PUT THE CONVERSATIONAL OF

02:44:35.099 --> 02:44:37.868 region:rollup2
IT? A LITTLE BIT AT A.

02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:39.203 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER HERE.

02:44:37.868 --> 02:44:40.704 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

02:44:39.203 --> 02:44:41.638 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE

02:44:40.704 --> 02:44:42.773 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:44.341 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO COULD

02:44:42.773 --> 02:44:46.377 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BE OR ALREADY ON A

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:48.112 region:rollup2
TRACK THAT SUCCESS WE'RE TRYING

02:44:46.377 --> 02:44:49.913 region:rollup2
TO SHORE SHORTEN THE TIME LIMIT.

02:44:48.112 --> 02:44:50.514 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE THAT

02:44:49.913 --> 02:44:51.915 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S GONNA PUT US RIGHT

02:44:50.514 --> 02:44:53.183 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND I'M SORRY I'M NOT

02:44:51.915 --> 02:44:53.817 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SHORTEN THE TIME LIMIT

02:44:53.183 --> 02:44:55.219 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I WANT I WANT TO KEEP

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:56.620 region:rollup2
THEM ON THE PATHWAY THERE ON I

02:44:55.219 --> 02:44:57.788 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE HOW THIS. THAT THAT

02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:58.689 region:rollup2
HELPS THEM COMPLETE THAT A GROUP

02:44:57.788 --> 02:45:00.190 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS HAS ALREADY A

02:44:58.689 --> 02:45:02.059 region:rollup2
PATHWAY TOWARD SUCCESS WE WERE

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:03.293 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A PERCENTAGE OF

02:45:02.059 --> 02:45:05.396 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO WERE NOT ON A

02:45:03.293 --> 02:45:09.333 region:rollup2
PATHWAY TO SUCCESS THAT WE WANT

02:45:05.396 --> 02:45:11.969 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL.

02:45:09.333 --> 02:45:14.271 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:45:11.969 --> 02:45:14.805 region:rollup2
ANSWERS.

02:45:14.271 --> 02:45:16.707 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DOCTOR

02:45:14.805 --> 02:45:18.842 region:rollup2
WEBER.

02:45:16.707 --> 02:45:20.210 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH I APPRECIATE THE BILL

02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:21.879 region:rollup2
COMING FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND

02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:23.714 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK.

02:45:21.879 --> 02:45:25.516 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT TO WRAP.

02:45:23.714 --> 02:45:27.151 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR MINDS AROUND THE THE

02:45:25.516 --> 02:45:28.819 region:rollup2
THREE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE AN IN

02:45:27.151 --> 02:45:30.487 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM ISN'T

02:45:28.819 --> 02:45:32.656 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF SYSTEM.

02:45:30.487 --> 02:45:33.791 region:rollup2
A AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK

02:45:32.656 --> 02:45:35.225 region:rollup2
AND I'VE HAD LOTS OF STUDENTS

02:45:33.791 --> 02:45:36.894 region:rollup2
WHO SPENT MANY YEARS THE

02:45:35.225 --> 02:45:38.929 region:rollup2
COMMUTER COLLEGES WHO'VE BEEN TO

02:45:36.894 --> 02:45:40.030 region:rollup2
TRANSFER TO THE UNIVERSITY. ARE

02:45:38.929 --> 02:45:41.432 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT AND

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:42.566 region:rollup2
THINK GEE THEY SHOULD OF DONE

02:45:41.432 --> 02:45:43.967 region:rollup2
THE FASTER THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE

02:45:42.566 --> 02:45:45.769 region:rollup2
IT. CLEANER THEY SHOULD UP

02:45:43.967 --> 02:45:47.671 region:rollup2
WHATEVER AND AND.

02:45:45.769 --> 02:45:48.739 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A RECOGNITION THAT

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:50.207 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THE STUDENTS WHO

02:45:48.739 --> 02:45:51.675 region:rollup2
ENTER THE COMMUNICABLE IS TO

02:45:50.207 --> 02:45:53.510 region:rollup2
SYSTEM NUMBER ONE WE KNOW THEY

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:54.678 region:rollup2
HAVE REMEDIAL ISSUES THAT THEY

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:56.079 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

02:45:54.678 --> 02:45:57.581 region:rollup2
TO THEY'RE NOT PROGRAM TO GO TO

02:45:56.079 --> 02:45:59.416 region:rollup2
COLLEGE MOST OF THEM ARE NOT.

02:45:57.581 --> 02:46:00.918 region:rollup2
THAT IN THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY

02:45:59.416 --> 02:46:02.052 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T THEY HAD THEY WOULD HAVE

02:46:00.918 --> 02:46:03.554 region:rollup2
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT YEARS

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:04.855 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND TAKEN S. A. T. AND

02:46:03.554 --> 02:46:05.756 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET INTO SOME FOUR YEAR

02:46:04.855 --> 02:46:07.090 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION I MEAN THEY'RE NOT

02:46:05.756 --> 02:46:08.792 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT ARE HITTING. ON

02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:10.527 region:rollup2
THAT PATH INITIALLY SO YOU'VE

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:12.763 region:rollup2
GOT SOME CHALLENGES THERE. WE

02:46:10.527 --> 02:46:14.298 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW FROM OUR OWN RESEARCH

02:46:12.763 --> 02:46:15.632 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE

02:46:14.298 --> 02:46:17.201 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION WE HAVE IS REALLY

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:18.335 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BECAUSE

02:46:17.201 --> 02:46:20.137 region:rollup2
OF THE FACT THAT MOST OF THEM

02:46:18.335 --> 02:46:21.038 region:rollup2
ARE STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:46:20.137 --> 02:46:22.840 region:rollup2
DON'T PAY THE HIGH FEES THEY

02:46:21.038 --> 02:46:24.441 region:rollup2
HAVE LIVING EXPENSES AND THINGS

02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:25.909 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. AND

02:46:24.441 --> 02:46:27.811 region:rollup2
SO OFTENTIMES OUR STUDENTS WHO

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:29.213 region:rollup2
DON'T GET. MUCH FINANCIAL AID I

02:46:27.811 --> 02:46:30.514 region:rollup2
DON'T APPLY FOR IT AT THE TIME

02:46:29.213 --> 02:46:32.149 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY WANT TO

02:46:30.514 --> 02:46:33.717 region:rollup2
SAVE IT FOR THE UNIVERSITY. ARE

02:46:32.149 --> 02:46:35.486 region:rollup2
OUT ARE BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD

02:46:33.717 --> 02:46:37.788 region:rollup2
THEM THAT COLLEGE WAS CHEAPER AT

02:46:35.486 --> 02:46:40.190 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND

02:46:37.788 --> 02:46:41.925 region:rollup2
IT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. THE

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:43.327 region:rollup2
ACTUAL FEES A PEOPLE PAPER WHEN

02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:45.062 region:rollup2
YOU GO BEYOND THAT AND START

02:46:43.327 --> 02:46:46.196 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT LIVING EXPENSES

02:46:45.062 --> 02:46:47.464 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON IT

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:49.800 region:rollup2
BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT AND MOST

02:46:47.464 --> 02:46:50.467 region:rollup2
OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE

02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:51.401 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE WORKING.

02:46:50.467 --> 02:46:52.035 region:rollup2
SOME HAVE FAMILIES HAVE ALL

02:46:51.401 --> 02:46:53.036 region:rollup2
KINDS OF ISSUES THAT ARE THERE

02:46:52.035 --> 02:46:54.705 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MAY

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:56.473 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SAY FOR THE MORE

02:46:54.705 --> 02:46:57.441 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCES. THREE

02:46:56.473 --> 02:46:59.309 region:rollup2
FOUR YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THEY

02:46:57.441 --> 02:47:01.211 region:rollup2
DON'T OFTEN DO FINANCIAL AID.

02:46:59.309 --> 02:47:02.846 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH AT THE COMMUNITY

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:03.580 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND THEY MISS OUT ON AN

02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:05.282 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:06.650 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SUPPORT THE KEEP THE

02:47:05.282 --> 02:47:08.218 region:rollup2
MOVING FORCE SO THEY DON'T HAVE

02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:09.820 region:rollup2
TO WORK SO MUCH. THEY DON'T HAVE

02:47:08.218 --> 02:47:11.121 region:rollup2
TO DROP OUT ONE FOR ONE SEMESTER

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:12.556 region:rollup2
TO THE NEXT TO MAKE THINGS

02:47:11.121 --> 02:47:13.624 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT

02:47:12.556 --> 02:47:15.392 region:rollup2
TO GET THE BOOKS I MEAN THAT'S

02:47:13.624 --> 02:47:16.894 region:rollup2
JUST UP A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS

02:47:15.392 --> 02:47:18.128 region:rollup2
THAT. BECAUSE THEY WANT PROGRAM

02:47:16.894 --> 02:47:19.663 region:rollup2
FOR THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE

02:47:18.128 --> 02:47:21.198 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THAT NOT GETTING THAT

02:47:19.663 --> 02:47:23.100 region:rollup2
KIND OF INFORMATION THAT KIND OF

02:47:21.198 --> 02:47:24.501 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND WE LOSE A LOT OF

02:47:23.100 --> 02:47:26.203 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND I'VE HAD STUDENTS

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:27.771 region:rollup2
TO SAY WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG.

02:47:26.203 --> 02:47:28.906 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I ACTUALLY LOOK AT

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:30.774 region:rollup2
THEIR JOURNEY IT WAS YOU KNOW

02:47:28.906 --> 02:47:32.042 region:rollup2
ALMOST LIKE A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:33.710 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR ONE

02:47:32.042 --> 02:47:35.078 region:rollup2
SEMESTER TO THE NEXT. WE HAD TO

02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:36.346 region:rollup2
DO THIS I HAD TO DO THAT THEY

02:47:35.078 --> 02:47:38.181 region:rollup2
WERE PAYING FOR THIS THAT TOP

02:47:36.346 --> 02:47:40.350 region:rollup2
AND DO THINGS AND SO IT REALLY

02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:41.251 region:rollup2
IS. QUITE AN INTERESTING JOURNEY

02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:42.386 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DEAL WITH COMMITTEE

02:47:41.251 --> 02:47:43.453 region:rollup2
COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO FINALLY

02:47:42.386 --> 02:47:45.088 region:rollup2
MAKE IT TO THE FORTY

02:47:43.453 --> 02:47:46.623 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT DEALT WITH

02:47:45.088 --> 02:47:48.125 region:rollup2
THEM AND THEY DO ABOUT THE TIME

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:49.593 region:rollup2
TO GIVE OF THEIR OLDER. THEY

02:47:48.125 --> 02:47:51.728 region:rollup2
HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN

02:47:49.593 --> 02:47:53.664 region:rollup2
INCOMMUNICADO JUST OF SEVERAL

02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:55.599 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES OVER AND OVER

02:47:53.664 --> 02:47:57.501 region:rollup2
AND SO AND AND THEY DON'T GET

02:47:55.599 --> 02:47:59.169 region:rollup2
ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:47:57.501 --> 02:48:00.437 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID IN THOSE KINDS OF

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:02.205 region:rollup2
THINGS INTO THE ALMOST AT THE

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:04.274 region:rollup2
END. SO I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT

02:48:02.205 --> 02:48:04.775 region:rollup2
POPULATION STUDENTS WERE TALKING

02:48:04.274 --> 02:48:05.642 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:48:04.775 --> 02:48:06.310 region:rollup2
TRYING TO LAND IT WOULD PROGRAM

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:07.010 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:48:06.310 --> 02:48:07.678 region:rollup2
SAY LISTEN YOU CAN ALSO GET SOME

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:08.946 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID SO YOU DON'T HAVE

02:48:07.678 --> 02:48:10.347 region:rollup2
TO WORK SO HARD. AND DON'T HAVE

02:48:08.946 --> 02:48:12.049 region:rollup2
TO DELAY GETTING YOUR BOOKS AND

02:48:10.347 --> 02:48:13.817 region:rollup2
OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND YOU

02:48:12.049 --> 02:48:15.419 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN BE A STUDENT WORKING

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:17.020 region:rollup2
PART TIME IN GOING TO COLLEGE SO

02:48:15.419 --> 02:48:18.755 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. T THAT

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:19.590 region:rollup2
LEVEL AT NET AT THIS I THINK

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:21.425 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED ONE OF OUR.

02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:22.993 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO HAVE A COMMUNITY

02:48:21.425 --> 02:48:24.861 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND AND SEE ISSUES NEW

02:48:22.993 --> 02:48:27.431 region:rollup2
SEASON WHEN WE WHEN WE TAKE OUT

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:29.099 region:rollup2
THE FAT VARIABLE OF. OF OF OF.

02:48:27.431 --> 02:48:31.001 region:rollup2
TUITION AND LOOK AT THE

02:48:29.099 --> 02:48:32.269 region:rollup2
EXPENSES AND WE DISCOVER THAT WE

02:48:31.001 --> 02:48:34.037 region:rollup2
GIVE MORE MONEY FOR SEE ISSUES

02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:35.872 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY FOR UC'S FOR LIVING

02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:36.406 region:rollup2
EXPENSES ALMOST NONE FAR

02:48:35.872 --> 02:48:37.708 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE AND SO AS A

02:48:36.406 --> 02:48:39.209 region:rollup2
RESULT.

02:48:37.708 --> 02:48:41.445 region:rollup2
THEY END UP WITH THE WILL OF THE

02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:43.080 region:rollup2
HIGHER. EDUCATION COSTS THEN THE

02:48:41.445 --> 02:48:44.848 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS AND SO WE REALLY

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.149 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN SO

02:48:44.848 --> 02:48:47.651 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING FORWARD

02:48:46.149 --> 02:48:49.252 region:rollup2
WITH THIS BECAUSE IT IS. IT IS

02:48:47.651 --> 02:48:50.787 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

02:48:49.252 --> 02:48:52.222 region:rollup2
WITH LONG TERM AND IT WOULD GIVE

02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:54.057 region:rollup2
WITHIN SOME PROVIDE SOME KIND OF

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:55.659 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND HELP THEM

02:48:54.057 --> 02:48:58.028 region:rollup2
THEY. AFFECT THEY SHOULD GET IT

02:48:55.659 --> 02:48:59.062 region:rollup2
EARLIER WILL BASICALLY BE IT AN

02:48:58.028 --> 02:49:00.764 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO

02:48:59.062 --> 02:49:02.366 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD. I THINK WE TAKE

02:49:00.764 --> 02:49:04.034 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT INCENTIVES AS IF TO

02:49:02.366 --> 02:49:06.370 region:rollup2
SAY GRADUATION ITSELF IS AN AND

02:49:04.034 --> 02:49:07.070 region:rollup2
SENATE ANDTHAT IS BUT THERE'S A

02:49:06.370 --> 02:49:09.039 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT KIND OF JOURNEY THIS

02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:10.607 region:rollup2
THE. AND THEY HANG IN THERE TO

02:49:09.039 --> 02:49:12.175 region:rollup2
