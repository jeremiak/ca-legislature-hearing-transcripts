AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. FIRST UP THOUGH IS ITEM NUMBER ONE SB THREE FIFTEEN HERTZBERG BEFORE WE GO TO CENTER HERTZBERG. I DO NOT THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM SO WE'RE NOT GONNA FISCHLI BEGAN AS A COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THAT'S THAT MEETS THE BE OKAY WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG WE CAN BEGIN. ABSOLUTELY SIR WELCOME OKAY. THE PRESIDENT'S AND THE CONGRESS. PASSED A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALLED THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH HAS. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE IMPACT OF US IN FOUR OF US FILING A TAX RETURNS JUST RECENTLY IF WE DID THEM ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. AS RELATED TO SOLVE DEDUCTIONS. ONE OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THAT MEASURE HAS DO WITH CREATING WHAT WAS CALLED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. SOMETHING THAT WAS INSPIRED BY. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY -- CORY BOOKER. AND SEAN PARKER. WERE KIND OF THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THIS AND THE NOTION IS. ON LIKE IN THE AREA OF PROPERTY TAX WHICH ARE -- WE CREATED THE C. R. A.'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THE GOVERNOR BROWN ELIMINATED. HE DID THAT IN MY JUDGMENT. FOR THREE BASIC REASONS WHY TAKING DOLLARS AWAY FOR THESE IS ARE THESE AREAS -- THAT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED. AND USING PROPERTY TAX THE INCOME AND PROPERTY TAX HE WAS IMPACTING SCHOOLS WHERE YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE INCOME IT WAS USED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. TO USE TAKING MONEY IN THE COUNTY LEVEL AWAY FROM SOCIAL SERVICES AND THREE ARM THERE WERE ISSUES THAT HE CERTAINLY SAW HIS IN HIS MUNICIPAL EXPERIENCE. DEALING WITH DEVELOPERS THE DIDN'T EXCITE HIM AND SO NOW WE HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IT INSTEAD OF USING PROPERTY TAX. UTILIZED INCOME TAX AND SO WE DON'T HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. CAPITAL GAINS AND THIS IS A WAY WHERE IN BROADLY SPEAKING. ARE INVESTORS WHO HAVE A CAPITAL GAIN CAN TAKE THEIR LIABILITY AND INVESTED IN OPPORTUNITIES ON THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE SUCH ZONES DESIGNATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY CAN INVESTIN THOSE LOANS. ARE ON AND GET A TAX DEFERRAL IF WITH THE INVESTMENT LAST FOR TEN YEARS GETS A STEPPED UP BASIS IN THE IN THE MEASURE WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN THIS BILL. IN BEFORE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT CONFORMITY LEGISLATION WITH RESPECT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS BUT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES. AND READ AS WRITTEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE APPARENTLY DURING THE OF MARK UP PROCESS THEY COULDN'T GET THIS IN. WAS TO HAVE A REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE INVESTMENTS LOOK LIKE WHERE THEY GOING ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THESE DELIVERABLES VERSES. YEARS MONEY OPPORTUNITIES OWN IT I'M BUYING A HIGH RISE BUILDING OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT IF IT'S IN THE ZONE IT QUALIFIES AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GATHER DATA -- THIS REPORTING PROCESS THAT WILL TRACK THE INVESTMENT INTENTIONS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THE IMPACT MEASURES AND REPORTING THE INVESTMENT THESIS REPORTING THE LAST COMMITTEE REPORT. UP ON END GIVES TRANSPARENCY FOR THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE AND IDEAS I MEAN THE THE VALUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH ARE COMMITTEE ENGAGEMENT EQUITY TRANSPARENCY. MEASUREMENT AND OUTCOMES SO WE THINK THAT -- IN TERMS OF CONFORMING AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IF IN FACT THERE DOCTOR WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOVERNOR CHOOSES THROUGH HIS BUDGET PROCESS. THAT BOLTED ON THIS IS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT SO WE CAN BEGIN TO TRACK WHAT MONEY GOES AND WHERE IT GOES WITH THAT -- WE'VE GOT A COUPLE WITNESSES AND TO BUT UP HEY WE WELCOME TO WITNESSES WILL NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES ENJOY THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU. YES SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CAN ALL MERCHANTS I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER OF CAL O. Z. WHICH IS A NEW NONPROFIT TRADE. GROUP DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THE QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES ON INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE TODAY EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE FIFTEEN OPPORTUNITIES UNDER A BIPARTISAN IDEA WITH ROOTS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S WORK TO UPLIFT URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA HAS THREE MILLION RESIDENTS IN OPPORTUNITIES ON FACING DAILY OBSTACLES TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. AND WHILE I WAS INVESTMENTS ARE OFFERS IMPORTANT NEW COMMUNITY INVESTMENT TOOL THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SQUANDER. THE TIME IS NOW TO ESTABLISH THE RIGHT FOUNDATION -- FOR DISEASE BUILT ON FOUR PILLARS PILLAR ONE IS PROTECTING AND EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES WITH LOCAL CONTROL SAFEGUARDS IN FUNDING TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES ON PROJECTS. PILLAR TO IS KEEPING CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE BY ENSURING STATE POLICY STAY APACE WITH NATIONAL TRENDS INCLUDING TAX CONFORMANCE. PILLAR THREE IS LEVERAGING CURACIES TO TURBO CHARGE OUR TRANSITION TO A GREEN ECONOMY. AND PILLAR FOR IS TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY THROUGH CLEAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SB THREE FIFTEEN MUST REQUIRE FUND MANAGERS TO ADOPT REPORTING PROTOCOLS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW WELL INVESTMENTS FOR DELIVERING A PROMISE IMPACTS. BEFORE FINALIZING THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL THE VOICES OF COMMUNITIES PROJECT PROPONENTS LOCAL POLICYMAKERS FUND MANAGERS. AND OTHERS ARE ARE CRITICAL TO SETTING STRONG BUT IT'S HUBAL GROUND RULES. CAL'S YOU'LL DO OUR PART TO FACILITATE THAT INPUT. LAST WEEK I WAS IN DC AND I ATTENDED THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE IN OPPORTUNITIES ON TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WHICH IS A PLACE IT IN EXACTLY SPEND EXPECTS BEEN A LOT OF TIME ON THESE DAYS -- BUT POLITICS ASIDE WHAT I SAW WAS INSPIRING AND MOTIVATING. REGARDLESS OF PARTY OR IDEOLOGY LEADERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE TAKING A RENEWED INTEREST IN SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES. TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND TOO OFTEN LEFT BEHIND. THE STRATEGIES TO DO SO MAY DESERVE BUT THE GOALS ARE THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY. AND YET THE QUESTION OF METRICS AND REPORTING FOR OPPORTUNITY ZONES REMAINS UNANSWERED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHICHIS CALIFORNIA A CHANCE TO SHOW NATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE FIFTEEN WITH AMENDMENTS AND MOVE OUR STATE ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE GOVERNOR'S VISION. OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THANK YOU MUCH I ANY OTHER WITNESSES.

THIS IS THE ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP. FOUR SEVENTY SIX CENTER STONE. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WELCOME HOME. THANK YOU MISTER TURN MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT -- SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR VERY GENEROUS TIME AND HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND ESPECIALLY YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR SPENDING. A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TIME WITH ME. THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY CURRENTLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DENY. OR REVOKE ANY PHARMACY LICENSE WHEN THEY'RE GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AS YOU MAY KNOW WHEN THE PHARMACIST EXCEPT THE TITLE OF THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE HE OR SHE IS SIGNING UP TO PUT OUR LICENSE ON THE LINE FOR THE PHARMACY THEY WORK IN. SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING MISTAKES. ARE TRULY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THIS BILL. SIMPLY SPECIFIES THAT A PERSON WHO SIGNS UP TO BE PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE. SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE PHARMACY THAT THEY HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER. CURRENTLY PHARMACISTS AND CHARGER FOUND IN VIOLATION BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT THE PHARMACY LICENSE HOLDER DID. DIDN'T DO OR INSTRUCTED THEM TO DO. THIS BILL WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM BY MAKING IT CLEAR THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE TOOK ALL ACTIONS WITHIN THEIR AUTHORITY. TO REMEDY A POSSIBLE VIOLATION. APPS MOST IMPORTANTLY SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX PLACES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATIONS ON A PHARMACY LICENSE HOLDER. FOR APPROPRIATING THE AUTHORITY OF THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE IN THEIR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES BY ALLOWING THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. DEFINED THE LICENSE HOLDER UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN TODAY'S WORLD YOUNG PHARMACISTS ARE TOO OFTEN OFF THE TITLE THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE IN EXCHANGE FOR A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS. AN HOUR WITHOUT REALIZING THAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDES PUTTING THEIR LICENSE AND HARD EARNED MONEY ON THE LINE. SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT LICENSE HOLDERS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS TAKEN AT THE PHARMACY. THIS BILL PROTECTS PHARMACISTS FROM BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER. IT'S COMMON SENSE IT'S FAIR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I DID HAVE TWO WITNESSES ARE GOING TO BE HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY ONE HAD TO FLY TO SOME IN CALIFORNIA TO BE WITH AN ILL PARENT AND THE OTHER ONE WAS SICK TODAY -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR I ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND IN SUPPORT. DOES HE GROW WITH UFCW WESTERN STATES COMES ON SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OR I WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. AT SENATOR UP FIRST LET ME THANK YOU FOR THAT FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE A PHARMACIST IN CHARGE I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT -- UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO AND AND YOUR BILL CERTAINLY HAS -- DRAWN MY ATTENTION AND I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES TO THE TO THE ISSUE. AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING -- TO FIND WAY I FIND A PATHWAY TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE -- I KNOW INITIALLY THE BILL -- REMOVE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE OF ACTIVITY THAT THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF AND I THINK YOU HEARD MY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THAT. I THOUGHT IT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO UNDER UNDERMINE CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND THAT WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE WAS APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK YOUR BILL THAN FEARED IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE SEE IT TODAY WHICH IS DIFFERENT DIRECTION ON THE OWNERSHIP OF THE THE FACILITY LESS THAN THAT AND ON THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE. AND US I APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND CERTAINLY THE EDUCATION THAT'S OCCURRED WITH THAT WITH THAT PROPELLED THE THE BILL AS YOU ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING IT. I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT STILL REMAINS WITH ME -- IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SIGNIFICANT OF A PROBLEM THIS IS -- OUT THERE IN OUR WORLD. AND THAT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO COMMENT UPON IN TERMS OF HIS OR ANY STUDY OR DATA THAT THAT YOU CAN REFERENCE THERE IN TERMS OF THIS BUT TO THIS. YUP POTENTIAL PROBLEM OR THIS EXISTING PROBLEM THANK YOU SENATOR YOU KNOW IS -- THE FIRST PHARMACIST IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THIRTY YEARS -- MANY OF THE PHARMACY PROFESSION IS KIND OF THEY SEE ME AS THEIR AMBASSADOR HERE IN IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I'VE. HAD NUMEROUS CORRESPONDENCES WITH THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY CITED AS PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE JOB BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO -- SENATOR -- MISTER CHAIR IS I'M GONNA REFER A LOT OF THOSE CORRESPONDENCES THAT I'M GETTING TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS NOT A OF AN ISSUE THAT I'VE I'VE DREAMED UP IT'S IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE OF OF GETTING COMPETENT PEOPLE -- THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ESPECIALLY IN RETAIL PHARMACY TO BE AND IN CHARGE OF THAT PHARMACY INTO CONTROL. OF THE MANY NUANCES THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE PHARMACY PHARMACY LAWS VERY COMPLICATED BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND ALL THAT RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE WHETHER R NOT. THEY'RE EVEN AT THE PHARMACY IF IT'S A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PHARMACY IN A VIOLATION OCCURS AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE GET CITED. IF YOU CAN DONATE ACTIVITY IN SHE IS SHOWN THEY GAVE DIRECTION TO DISOBEY THE LAW HE DESERVES TO BE CITED AS THE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE. BUT BUT I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO HEAR FROM THOSE PHARMACISTS THAT. ARE REFRAIN FROM BIG PHARMACISTS CHARGES KNOWS OF AN INAPPROPRIATELY SIDE. I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT. I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE THE LEGISLATURE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN LIFE THAT WE BRING TO THE ARE LAWMAKING PROCESS BECAUSE THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT MAKES GOOD LOSS RIGHT AND AND MAKES GOOD JUDGMENTS IS THAT WE WE SEE AND FEEL THAT EXPERIENCE. CERTAINLY THAT ALSO COMES FROM THE WITNESSES THAT COME AND TESTIFY BEFORE US. I'M SO WHAT I I THINK FOR ME AT LEAST THAT WHERE I'D BE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE IN MOVING THIS BILL IS THAT IF WE WE ASK THAT THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND SEE IF THEY CAN -- TAKE A CAREFUL LOOK AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS A PROBLEM AND INFORM US. TO WHAT THEY FIND THAT THAT MIGHT BE FOR ME AT LEAST PROVIDE A BETTER FOUNDATION AND WHICH HAD. TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF FIVE RAISING FINE LEVELS IS THIS BILL PROPOSES OR OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE MIGHT. CONSIDER DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE OUR RULES ARE ENFORCED THAT THE PERSON IN CHARGE REALLY IS IN CHARGE. I AND IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT AND IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND SO. I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BE WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT IDEA OF OF DIRECTING THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE IN MORE DETAIL -- WE COME UP WITH LANGUAGE IS TO THIS SPECIFIC -- THINGS THAT THEY WOULD DO BUT ASSN TO REPORT BACK IN A YEAR -- TO WITH THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THESE FOR ME AND I'LL LIST I HEAR FROM MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELLBUT THAT WOULD MAKE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE RATHER THAN JUST THE ATTACKS FINE CHANGE. WITHOUT A REAL CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEM IS TO LET'S TAKE IT A HALF STEP FORWARD MAYBE BUT AT LEAST A STEP FORWARD. AS YOU WORK TO EDUCATE US AND OTHERS AS TO WHY THIS MAY BE A PROBLEM OUT THERE WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT YES -- MISTER HERE I'M HAPPY -- TO TO WORKWITH YOU AND IF IF THAT'S THE DIRE THE CHAIR OF THE HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE YOU -- YOU MAY ASK YOU KNOW WHY THE TEN FOLD INCREASE IN IN THE FINE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE LARGE CHAINS IT'S VERY EASY WITH THEM WHEN THEY GET A VIOLATION IS WRITE A CHECK FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND MOVE ON BUT I CAN TELL YOU IF IT'S FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AND SAY OKAY WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT PROBLEM I THINK THEY'LL BE A LOT MORE SERIOUS. SO -- IT'S IF THAT'S THE WILL OF THE CHAIR I'M HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE YOU AT YOU SIR IN THE COMMITTEE IN ANY WAY TO WITH THE BILL FORWARD OKAY LET ME SEE IF I COLLEGES ANY AGREEMENT OR DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT DIRECTION. SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK THAT'S A A GOOD APPROACH -- AND IT MIGHT THE SOLUTION AND THE SANCTION MAY NOT JUST BE FINANCIAL IT THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER RESTRICTIONS IT COULD BE PLACED ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN SOME CASES SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH TO HAVE THE THE BOARD OF PHARMACEUTICAL. A CLOSER LOOK AT IT MAYBE IN ONE YEAR YOU KNOW GIVE A LITTLE TIME I DON'T HAVE TO IS NECESSARY BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING SOONER THAN LATER MAY BE HELPFUL. OKAY THANK CENTER LEYVA YOUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I AGREE WITH YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS BUT I ALSO LIKE TO SAY I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR STONE. THAT MANY OF THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS TO SEE IT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND SO IF IT'S FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'LL DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO WRITE THE CHECK AND CONTINUE TO BE REPEAT VIOLATORS. SO SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A BIGGER STICK SO. I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH PRECEDING THE PHARMACY BOARD THAT'S FINE WITH ME. ALL RIGHT. CENTER ARCHULETA YEAH MY CONCERN -- THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS BEFORE AT MY CONCERN IS -- HAVING A TOO LONG I THINK TWO YEARS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG IF THERE'S AT IF THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE AREN'T AWARE OF IT. THEN YOU GOT TO BRING IT BACK WITH FACTS AND DATA. SO THEN WE CAN ACT QUICKLY BECAUSE I THINK TWO YEARS WOULD BE TOO LONG. A MISTER CHAIR OF SO AS I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE MATCHES TO THE BETTER. THAN A GET WELL IF THIS BILL AT IS IS ENACTED THIS YEAR IT WOULDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY SO MAYBE ALLOWING THEM TO REPORT BACK IN. TWENTY ONE A YEAR LATER MIGHT BE THE APPROPRIATE DATE I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WOULD -- BUT I WOULD SUGGEST. SO SO CENTER A GALGIANI. TOM WHAT ABOUT THE SMALL MOM AND POP PHARMACIES ARE THEY TREATED THE SAME UNDER THIS BILL. BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SMALL PHARMACY OWN PHARMACISTS TO MAKE THE MISTAKE. THAT COULD PUT THAT PHARMACIST OUT OF BUSINESS ENTIRELY WELL IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO GET FINED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS FOR NOT FOLLOWING PHARMACY LAWS IN EXAMPLE. THERE'S A CERTAIN RACIAL PHARMACY TECHS THAT YOU CAN HAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW SO IF YOU'RE A SOLE PROPRIETOR LIKE I AM A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY. AND I DECIDE I'M GONNA HAVE SIX TAX WORKING BECAUSE I NEED TO GET THE VOLUME AT A ONE IRON OF THE PHARMACIST AND THEY SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY CHARGE. HOWEVER IT'S UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE STATE BOARD LEVY THAT KIND OF A FEE UNLESS IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY SERIOUS. SO IT'S LIKELY THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN TO A SOLE PROPRIETOR I I WOULD DOUBT IT BUT ALSO IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR HILL. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT FINES WERE TALKING ABOUT -- SUSPENSIONS OUR REPLICATIONS OF LICENSES THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY HAVE -- THE CHAIN STORES ATTENTION WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OF THEIR STORES THEY DON'T WANT THE PRESS. TO GET A HOLD OF THE FACT THAT THERE ONE STORE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE PHARMACISTS WERE WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE LAWS SO. THIS IS NOT JUST FINANCES ALSO THE LICENSES IS THE KEY TO MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. THEIR LICENSE IS IN JEOPARDY IF THERE'RE AND IF THEY'RE NOT INSTRUCTING -- THEIR PHARMACIST IN CHARGE TO CARRY OUT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF THEY BASICALLY TOM TO SKIRT THE LAW OR YOU'RE GONNA BE FIRED IN THE AND AND THEY DO THAT. THEN THE LICENSEE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THE PICTURE BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AS WELL. OKAY CENTER GALGIANI AND OTHERS SO BY THE AUTHORS AGREEING -- TO MAN HIS BILL TO ELIMINATE -- THE PROVISIONS RELATIVE TO FINES AND OBLIGATIONS AND SIMPLY ASK AS AS I STUDY BE DONE TO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. ON THIS ISSUE AND REPORT BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA. THAT'S WHAT WE IF THE COMMITTEE AGREES THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TODAY. OKAY SENATOR A STONE YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON THAT THAT THAT NOTE YES MISTER I THINK WE DISCUSSED AT THE TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PHARMACISTS WOULD LIKE TO BE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE I THINK WHICH HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE PHARMACIST IN CHARGE ESPECIALLY. WITH THE GRADUATES THAT ARE COMING ONLINE -- I LEARNED MY MY BEST -- CARE OF PATIENTS THROUGH. YOUNG OR PHARMACIST IN CHARGE THAT I WORK WITH. ONE DR JIM DE WAS MY PRECEPTOR IN HOLLYWOOD WHO TAUGHT ME A LOT MORE THAN EVER HEARD IN PHARMACY SCHOOL ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY AND AND CARING FOR PATIENTS AND IN HIS MEMORY I'D LIKE. TO ASK YOUR AYE. THEY'RE IN VERY NICE SELF UP FOR OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- ASKED FOR A MOTION THAT THAT WOULD BE DO PASS -- WITH THE AUTHORS -- PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO REPLACE THE CONTENT OF THE BILL WITH THE REQUIREMENT. TO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TO DO A STUDY. REPORTING BACK TO US IN JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF THE PREVALENCE -- INTERFERENCE OF CORPORATE MANAGEMENT AND PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE AND THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT. AND THAT THAT THE AUTHOR WORK WITH OUR STAFF ON THAT EXACT LANGUAGE PRIDE WHICH FOR PRESENTATION TO APPROPRIATIONS. OKAY. CENTER LEYVA WAS THAT TO THAT ITEM. WITH THAT THE SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA AIDAN GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE HILL.

SIX FIVE EIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE I MEAN MR CARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. PRESENT SB. SIX FIVE EIGHT AND I AM -- AS YOU COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STAGE I AM REMOVING THE FIRST SECTION OF THIS BILL AS AGREED UPON AS DURING THE DISCUSSIONS I THINK.

AN INCREASE CONSUMER SAFETY AND CANNABIS INDUSTRY THE STREET FOR MEASURED THOSE TWO THINGS ARE REQUIRED TO BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO US DOLLARS. ECONOMIST RETAIL BUSINESS EMBLEM PROGRAM AND TO AUTHORIZE LOCAL ROUTE -- REGULATORS ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. WITH THE VOTER APPROVAL OR PROP SIXTY FOUR IN PASSAGE OF THE CIVIL ADULT USE CANNABIS -- REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT OUR STATE ESTABLISHED A ROBUST TOOL LICENSE LICENSING SYSTEM WHICH REQUIRES BUSINESS OWNERS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FROM THEIR LOCAL GOVERNING BODY. AS WELL AS THE STATE LICENSE FROM THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF BUSINESS THEY'RE OPERATING. WHERE'S WHERE IS A KEY FEATURE OF THE LAWS WAS PASSED WORK TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO CREATE A FUNCTIONAL INDUSTRY. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THE PREEXISTING UNDERGROUND MARKETING COMPLEX LICENSE LAWS HAVE SLOWED THIS PROGRESS THE LISTEN MARKET REMAINS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR MANY CANNABIS CONSUMERS TO THE LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS OWNERS. ARE ABLE TO THE SKIES -- ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AS HIGH IN LEGAL BUSINESSES. BECAUSE CONSUMERS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO EASILY IDENTIFY LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES FROM THE ILLEGITIMATE BUSINESSES MANY PUT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDRESS BY PATRONIZING RETAILERS WHO WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE NOT TESTED AND OPERATIONS ARE NOT REGULATED SB SIX FIVE EIGHT ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THE BUREAU TO DEVELOP.

OUR STATE IS RECENTLY -- STOPS -- TREES AND NOT TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM USED BY ALL STATE CANNABIS LICENSEES FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPORTING THE MOVEMENT ACCOUNT OF HIS. THROUGHOUT EACH STEP OF THE SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION TRACK CHANGE. THE PROBLEM IS UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE IS AMBIGUITY AS TO WHO CAN ACCESS THE SYSTEM BESIDES THE THREE STATE LICENSE ENTITIES AND THE STATE. FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SB SIX FIVE A PROVIDES IN THIS THIRTY CLARITY FOR LOCAL REGULATORY. REGULATORS TO TRACK AND TRACE TO GROWTH MOVEMENT AND SELL ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE CITY AND COUNTY. OVERALL THIS BILL WILL HELP IMPROVE OUR STATE REGULATORY SYSTEM BY INCREASING CONSUMER PROTECTION TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ENFORCE THEIR CAMPS LOS.

HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CANNABIS MARKET AND AS SUCH THE SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IS VERY MUCH INTERDEPENDENT WITH THE SUCCESS OF LOCAL REGULATORY PROGRAMS. AS SUCH WE WORKED INTENTIONALLY WITH STATE OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT FIRST IN TIME POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.

CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS CAN MAYBE CHECK ONLINE FOR HAVE TO GO INTO A PHYSICAL LOCATION OVER TO DETERMINE IF A LICENSE I BUSINESS IS LICENSE. IN ORDER FOR THE LEGAL MARKET TO BE SUCCESSFUL CONSUMERS MOST MUST BE BOTH AWARE OF THE LOCATION OF LICENSE FACILITIES AND AWARE OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED. WITH BUYING FROM LEGAL OR ILLEGAL CANNABIS STORES FURTHERMORE LOCAL REGULATORS MUST BE AWARE OF HOW. AND WHAT PRODUCTS ARE MOVING IN AND THROUGH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY IS JUST GETTING STARTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND WE HOPE THAT THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL BOTH CONSUMERS AND LOCAL REGULATORS ARE EMPOWERED.

SB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ITEM NUMBER THREE WHERE DID YOU GO ANY TIME YOU ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND WELCOME BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TODAY AND I APOLOGIZE ABOUT BEING. A LITTLE LATE. I WILL ADMIT THAT THIS ISSUE -- THAT WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WE TACKLED BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT'S A COMPLICATED ONE BUT WE'RE LUCKY THAT TODAY'S BILL IS A SIMPLE CLEAN UP -- TO A PREVIOUS STATE BILL THAT PROTECTS FOSTER YOUTH. THE CITY CALIFORNIA MISTER CHEERS GUARDIAN TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. IN A HOLDS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. THIS BILL IT EXTENDS TO THE MONITORING IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF MIND NUMBING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS. THAT CAN LEAD TO IRREVERSIBLE IN LIFELONG IMPACTS IF NOT PRESCRIBED APPROPRIATELY. IN AN EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO CRACK DOWN ON EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PSYCHOTROPIC PRESCRIBING TO FOSTER YOUTH. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A SERIES OF BILLS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN INCLUDING SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS INTENDED TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD DATA TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL. I WANT TO STRESS POTENTIAL CASES OF INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR BUT BUILT OFF A IN EXISTING DATA SAID. N. IN EXISTING DATA SHARING AGREEMENT. AND IT ESTABLISH A FORMAL ONGOING PROCESS FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO REVIEW AND CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE PSYCHOTROPIC. MEDICATION PRESCRIBING PATTERNS OUTSIDE THE STANDARD OF CARE. FOR FOSTER USED TO HAVE BEEN ON THREE OR MORE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS FOR NINETY OR MORE DAYS. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROVIDES THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH THE FOLLOWING. NUMBER ONE A LIST A PSYCH MEDS PRESCRIBED. NUMBER TWO THE START AND STOP DATES FOR EACH MEDICATION. THREE THE FOSTERS YOUTH DATE OF BIRTH AND NUMBER FOUR THE STRENGTH IN QUANTITY OF MEDICATION AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS SUPPLY OF MEDICATION. MET THE MEDICAL BOARD THEN CONTRACTS WITH AN EXPERT PSYCHIATRISTS WHO SPECIALIZES IN PEDIATRIC CARE TO REVIEW THE DATA TO DETERMINE IF AN ACCUSATION OF INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WELL SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT FOR STATES FATHI FOSTER YOUTH. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS SINCE INDICATED THAT THE DATA SHARED DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION. FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL MEDICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS A DIAGNOSIS FOR THE PSYCH MADE PRESCRIPTION. NOW THIS IS WHERE IT GETS COMPLICATED LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE BETTER DETERMINE. IF A CHILD IS BEING OVER PRESCRIBED HERE WE GO SAID ARCHER LET IS READY [inaudible] NUMBER. ONE EARLY THE MEDICAL BOARD FLAG THE CASE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THEY MUST GO THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS A LIAISON TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO CONTRACT THE INDIVIDUAL FOSTER YOUTH. MEDICAL BORDEN PROVIDES DSS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFYING NUMBER WHICH DSS THEN HAS TO GO MATCH TO A NAME OF A CURRENT OR FORMER FOSTER. DSS THEN SENDS A LETTER TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS TO THE FOSTER YOUTH. AND OR THE COUNTY ASKING PERMISSION. FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO CONTACT THE FOSTER YOUTH. IF DSS GETS A LETTER BACK WITH APPROVAL. THE MEDICAL BOARD THEN MUST CONTACT THE CHILD TO USE AGAIN TO ASK FOR AUTHORIZATION. FOR THE RELEASE OF RECORDS. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN PROVEN SO CUMBERSOME THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CARRY OUT. THEIR A STATUTORY OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE FIRST BATCH OF CASES THE MEDICAL BOARD LOOKED INTO. THE EXPERT WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD FLAG EIGHTY SIX USE THAT NEEDED MORE INFORMATION. DSS SINCE THEN EIGHTY SIX LETTERS OUT BUT ONLY RECEIVED FIVE RESPONSES. THOSE FIVE RESPONSES WERE USED EIGHTEEN OR OLDER. NINE BILLION MEET THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IN AFTER CONTACTING THE USE THE MEDICAL BOARD WAS ABLE TO GET AUTHOR ASIA AUTHORIZATION. FOR THREE THIS BROKEN PROMISE HAS PROVEN INEFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOUTH FOM OVER PRESCRIBING OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION. SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE AND FINALLY ALLOW FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO GET ACCESS WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO CONFIDENTIALLY I WANT TO STRESS THAT CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE. BY GRANTING AUTHORIZATION WITHIN A MEDICATION IS AUTHORIZED BY THE COURTS. CURRENTLY ALL PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION FOR MINORS IN FOSTER YOUTH MUST BE APPROVED BY JUVENILE COURT JUDGE IN THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE JV TO TWENTY FOUR THAT THE JUDGE HAS TO BE APPROVED. UP FROM A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN FRONT OF THEM AS FAR AS THE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS. SB THREE SEVEN SEVERAL CREATIVE PROCESS THAT ESTABLISHES AT THE TIME APPROVAL OF A PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE WILL AUTHORIZE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO REVIEW THE DIAGNOSIS. FROM THAT FORM FOR THE PRESCRIPTION SHOULD THE MEDICAL BOARD NEED TO INVESTIGATE. THIS BILL ALLOWS REQUIREMENTS OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR TO BE REALIZE THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN THE SPIRIT A PASS IN ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR APPROVED TO BE A TO PROTECT. THESE YOUTH BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND THREE YEARS LATER IT'S BEEN POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO GATHER THE DATA. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JENNIFER SOMOS WHO'S BEEN LIVING THIS DREAM -- SHE'S CHIEF LEGISLATION AT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND SHE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT MAY HAVE AS WELL AS SPEAK TO ANY CONCERNS THAT ANY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO DO SO AS WELL. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE LONG A STATEMENT IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MCGUIRE. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ARE THERE OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. HE COME FORWARD. ALL RIGHT ANY -- FOLKS WHO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL OPPOSE POSITION. BUT AS WE READ THE ANALYSIS IN A WE JUST RECENTLY GOT OUR OWN LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE BILL WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE MIGHT BE -- SOMEONE WHO HAVE HOLES LEGAL PRIVILEGE UNDER THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST PATIENT PRIVILEGE IN THE EVIDENCE CODE. WHO HAS EITHER REFUSED ON BEHALF OF A PATIENT OR HAVE HAS THE PATIENT HAS -- REFUSED TO SIGN A RELEASE FOR THAT INFORMATION SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD BE AN END RUN AROUND THE PRIVILEGE. AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHERE WE LAND ON THIS. BECAUSE SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL ASK THE OFFICE THAT QUESTION IN JUST A MOMENT ANYBODY ELSE. WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITIONTO THIS BILL OR WITH QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT NOT WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK OUT TO THE COMMITTEE. A CENTER DO YOU ARE YOU REPRESENT ONE OF ADDRESS THAT CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO WORK WITH MISTER HAGEL SO WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY WORKING WITH MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS ON THIS BILL. FOR WORKING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD THE MEDICAL BOARD -- IN I HAD A MEETING WITH DSS WE ALSO HAD A MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WERE ALSO CURRENTLY MEETING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ON THIS BILL AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO MEET ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS A BIT OF A COMPLICATED ONE AND WE NEED TO BE -- TO GET IRONED OUT BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAFETY PROTECTION OF FOSTER YOUTH -- AND YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE WORKING MISTER HAGEL IN ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. THAT WITH THAT OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE QUESTION IN FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD AND IT SHOWS THE THE THIS SEEMS LIKE EVERY. PRESCRIPTION WOULD THEN GO TO THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR SOME OF THE U. ATION. IT IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING AND THAT WOULD. DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO THEN HAVE THAT. GO TO A PROFESSIONAL. TO TO THEN THE I GUESS IT'S SO IT'S A TIME MANAGEMENT ISSUE. IS THAT WORKABLE. SO I DON'T IT'S NOT THE EVERY EVERY WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT EVERYONE'S RECORDS ARE GONNA PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IT'S BASICALLY A PRECURSOR TO OUR PROCESS NOW. SO THAT AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE WAITING THERE SO WHEN WE GO THROUGH THAT DATA USAGE AGREEMENT AND HAVE OUR EXPERT. YOU KNOW LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION AND SAY HERE SOME POTENTIAL INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING WHEN WE GAVE THAT -- IDENTIFIER NUMBER TO DSS TO MATCH UP TO FIND OUT WHICH CHILD IS IF THERE WAS ONE OF THESE ON FILE THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IT'S AN ACQUIRED DESCRIBED WITH. YOU KNOW DSS SAID IN A LETTER AND THEN GETTING SOMETHING BACK AND THEN US IN IN A LETTER IT WOULD ALREADY BE THERE AND SO ONCE THAT INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING IS IDENTIFIED. AND AND THE YOU KNOW SOMETHING WAS ON FILE BECAUSE THIS BILL PASSED THEN WE WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO GET THE RECORDS LOOK AT IT HAS NOT EACH ONE WOULD NOT BE. REQUIRE APPROVED YEAH OKAY THANK YOU.

WHICH PHILLY PRESENTING THAT FIRST [inaudible] SIX FIFTY OKAY. ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN SB SIX FIFTY PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. TERM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TâM PROUD TO PRESENT SB SIX FIFTY AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT RELATES TO COUNTER MEDICATION. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB SEVEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH ALLOWED COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS TO DISPENSE. DONATED UNUSED MEDICATIONS HOWEVER THE BILL WAS LIMITED TO COUNTY RUN OR CONTRACTED PHARMACIES AND CANCER MEDICATION WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM. AS AMENDED SB SIX FIFTY WILL REQUIRE THE BOARD OF PHARMACY IS TO WRITE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE REPORT SHALL IDENTIFY THE BEST MECHANISMS TO ENABLE THE TRANSFER OF AND USE COUNTY MEDICATIONS. TO PERSONS IN NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO NECESSARY MEDICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE BOARD SHALL ANALYZE THE EXISTING SURPLUS MEDICATION COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. DID IT AND DETERMINE WHAT MODIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS NEEDING CANCER DRUGS. MR TURN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TWO WITNESSES WHO WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THEIR TESTIMONY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THIS SET SHORT AND AUTUMN ADEN VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR HERE FIRST WITNESS. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS -- ALTAMONT IN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK -- CANCER IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE USTHE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION NEW CASES OF CANCER WILL BE DIAGNOSED IN THE U. S. IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'M MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION AMERICANS LIVING TODAY HAVE A CANCER HISTORY. NOT ONLY DOES CANCER TAKE AN ENORMOUS TOLL ON THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS AS SURVIVORS. IT ALSO HAS A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL IMPACT. AND TWENTY FOURTEEN US CANCER PATIENTS PAID NEARLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND THE DISEASE BECAUSE THE COUNTRY EIGHTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION IN CANCER RELATED HEALTH CARE SPENDING. EVEN WITH INSURANCE CANCER PATIENTS OFTEN FACE UNPREDICTABLE OR UNMANAGEABLE COSTS INCLUDING HI COINSURANCE HI DEDUCTIBLES. AND I ARE HAVING TO SEEK OUT OF NETWORK CARE AND NEEDING TREATMENT THAT IS NOT COVERED BY THEIR HEALTH PLAN. AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOME CANCER PATIENTS TO FIND OUT EARLY IN THEIR TREATMENT. THAT THEIR TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE NOT WORKING AND THIS LEAVES THEM WITH ON USE AND I NEEDED MEDICATION -- AS CERTAIN AS BE SIX FIFTY WOULD HAVE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE WASTE AND INCREASE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR DILIGENCE AND THEIR HARD WORK ANDI THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING TODAY. WILL OFFER CALIFORNIA A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TAKE A STEP BACK AND% UTILIZE THE GUIDANCE OF THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TAX HAS THE BEST. A SAYS THE BEST COURSE OF FORWARD AND INSURING THIS PROGRAM WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. THE SET SHORT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATES ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONCOLOGY NOW TO START BY THANKING SENATOR RUBIO AND HER STAFF OFFER CHAMPING THIS ISSUE ON BEHALF OF CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR PHYSICIANS. I'M PLEASED TO BE ARM ON BEHALF OF AND SUPPORT OF SIX FIFTY THE BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE CURRENT DRUG RECYCLING PROGRAM -- IS REALLY FAILING ARE CANCER PATIENTS WELL IT IS DOING A GOOD JOB AND AND HELPING SOME PATIENCE AND SOME LOCAL ENTITIES -- IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTING AND UNUSED MEDICATIONS. ARE CANCER PATIENTS ARE NOT -- BENEFITING FROM THESE PROGRAMS -- WE BELIEVE THAT CANCER PATIENTS -- NEED TO GET SOME RELIEF FROM THE COST OF THEIR MEDICATIONS AND AND RECEIVE TIMELY MET ACCESS TO TIMELY MEDICATIONS AND A PROGRAM -- LIKE THE ONE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I THINK WILL LEAD US IN THAT DIRECTION. OUR PHYSICIANS SEE CANCER PATIENTS EVERY DAY WHO HAVE I NEEDED UNUSED MEDICATIONS IT'S THE NATURE OF CANCER TREATMENT AND THEY ALSO SEE EVERYDAY PATIENTS WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF THEIR MEDICATIONS TO STARS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- AND DON'T WANT TO AND DON'T AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT. A LENGTHY PART OF TIME FOR THEM TO ACCESS THOSE MEDICATIONS -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE BOARD -- TO CREATE THIS REPORT WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAGGING BEHIND IN CREATING SUCH A PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW OUR PATIENTS ON CALL JUST TO TEAM UP TO ENSURE MEDICATION IS NOT WASTED. AND ENSURE THAT MEDICATION GETS INTO THE HANDS OF THESE PATIENTS THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR IT. I'M AN EXAMPLE OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN CREATED IN NEW MEXICO WHERE IT IS SAFE PATIENTS AND ONE PRACTICE ALONE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A YEAR. AND WE THINK CALIFORNIA PATIENTS DESERVE JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE -- SB SIX FIFTY IN THIS REPORT WILL BE A STEP TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING FOR CANCER PATIENTS. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CHANGE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM. SO -- DRIVE A THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR LET ME JUST SAY THANK YOU TO YOU -- YOU HAVE A HEART OF GOLD FOR AND SO MANY WAYS BUT CERTAINLY -- WE SHARE THAT GREAT CONCERN FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND ALL THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND YEAR. YOU WITNESSES OF FAST SO A PROBABLY IDENTIFIED THOSE CHALLENGES AND BURDENS AND IT'S IT'S A VERY SCARY TIME AND AND COST SHOULD BE -- SUCH A DOMINANT ELEMENT IN TERMS OF GETTING. A PROPER TREATMENT AND I I AT YOUR BILL IS HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS. IT'S NOT THE STUFF FULLY STEP FORWARD THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I HOPE THAT IT IS A STEP FORWARD AND I THINK PART OF OUR OBLIGATION -- IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THIS IDEA THAT THE THE WITH THE STUDY THAT'S DONE THE WORK THAT'S DONE -- IS DONE WITH THE IDEA OF HOW WE HOW WE CAN DO MORE AND DO BETTER. AND I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUSH US INTO QUITE APPROPRIATELY. SO -- I THANK YOU FOR BEING A CHAMPION FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT JEWISH THANK YOU AND THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME I ACT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE. OKAY STAY HERE SENATOR HILL -- CENTER ARCHULETA. MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. THERE CAN YOU USE THAT YOU IT REALLY. ALL RIGHTYOUR ONE ALL RIGHT SO IN A MOTION BY SENATOR ISOLATE AND SENATOR PAN WE COULD -- CALL THE ROLL THE BILL AS AN AS AMENDED DO PASSION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GLAZER. HI GLAZER AYE CHIANG. CHING AYE ARCHULETA. GALGIANI AYE HILL. AYE LEYVA. LIVE AYE PAN. CAN I WILL. OKAY THAT BILL HAD -- WITH IT ISN'T [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT BILLS OUT SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU -- JUST ONE MOMENT. ALL RIGHT A I UNDERSTAND SENATOR HUESO -- IS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US HERE THIS MORNING. AND CENTER RUBIO YOU'RE GONNA PERCENT FOR HAVE THIS IS -- ITEM TWENTY SB. SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT YES THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SB SEVEN THIRTY A. WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA TRADE AND SERVICE OFFICE ADVISORY GROUP TO PRIORITIZE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY MEXICO. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN FEBRUARY THE GOVERNOR DESIGNATED LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR COOL KNOCK AS AS THE STATE'S REPRESENTATIVE ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA TRADE AND SERVICE OFFICE ADVISORY GROUP CONSISTING OF PRIVATE SECTOR AND NON GOVERNMENTAL LEADERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLORING. AND IDENTIFYING THE USE OF NON STATE FUNDS TO OPEN IN SUPPORT OFFICE AS PROMOTING CALIFORNIA TRADE. AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT ADVISORY GROUP TO PRIORITIZE ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY MEXICO. CALIFORNIA HAS THE FIFTH FLOOR IT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AS A RESULT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE EXPAND OUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ABROAD. AND ENSURE THAT WE REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN TODAY'S GLOBAL MARKET. AS OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRY THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT OFFICE IN MEXICO MAKES SENSE MEXICO IS THE FIFTEENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD MORE SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA MEXICO SHARE A ROBUST TRADE RELATIONSHIP. NOT ESTABLISHING A TREAT OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY PUTS CALIFORNIA AT A HEIGHT DISADVANTAGE TO TRACK TRADE AND INVESTMENT INTO OUR STATE. MEXICO HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST NETWORKS OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN THE WORLD WITH MORE THAN 90% OF TRADE ACCORDING OCCURRING UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. SINCE MUCH OF THIS TRADE AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAPPENS WITH THE U. S. CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT TO BENEFIT FROM EXPANDING OUR POTENTIAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH MEXICO. WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE IS DOUGLAS MERE PRACTICING ATTORNEY OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO YOUR FIRST WITNESS. WELL THE THINK YOU -- COMMITTEE I MEAN IS THAT WAS MORE -- I DAYS SERVED AS AN INTERN FOR AN OR PRO TEN RIVER RD BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN I WAS AT THE DOOR -- AND WE ACTUALLY SET AT THE COVEN WORLD TRADE MISSION AND FROM THERE. THE ORIGINAL. OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY -- I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SERVE AS A DIRECTOR OF THE MEXICO CITY OFFICE UNDER GOVERNOR. GRAY DAVIS AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE ROUTE MIGHT -- THESIS WHEN I WAS DOING MY EL AL AND DEGREE AT THE FLETCHER SCHOOL ON CALIFORNIA DRAFT INTERNATIONALLY THE NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM -- CELL I THINK YOU WILL. BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND THE LARGER SUPPORTER OF RE ESTABLISHING -- THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE IN MEXICO -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS IN REGARDS -- TO THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW -- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED. TO COLLABORATE AND WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I HAVEN'T HAD TALKS WITH WITH BOTH OF THEM -- WHAT I AM? CONCERNED ABOUT IS. CALIFORNIA MISSING A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS BEFORE IT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE OFFICES WERE CLOSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE. DUTY AND OBLIGATION TO CLOSE OUR OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO REESTABLISH CALIFORNIA AS A PRESENCE THAT IT NEEDS TO HAVE INTERNATIONALLY AND THE VITAL IMPORTANCETHAT IT HAS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AND IN THAT -- RESPECT I'D LIKE TO SUBMIT MY MY PAPER -- HANDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE RECORD THAT GOES TO THE FORTY YEAR HISTORY. OF HOW IT DID REGIONAL INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED BY WAS A STAB LIST THE PALMS IT HAD AND WHAT LED TO ITS ULTIMATE DEMISE. AND WHAT I SEE IN THIS BILL ALL RIGHT NOW OR ARE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE. ACTION IS BETTER THAN NO ACTION. BUT WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE INPUT AND DIRECTION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TENANT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- BUT TWO THINGS DRAMA TENSION. A NUMBER ONE THE NAME OF THE OFFICE I WOULD NOT CALL IT THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF TRADE INVESTMENT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS THERE. I'D SAY MAYBE HALF OF MY WORK WAS IN REGARDS TO ACTUALLY TRADE INVESTMENT. THE MAJORITY OF IT WAS WORKING ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. AND OUR RELATIONS WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT -- WHERE THERE IS AT THE -- WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ORDERED THE MEMBERS HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IN PUTTING THROUGH THE KEY -- ISSUES AT STAKE AT THAT TIME AND THAT WILL PLAY. INTO EFFECT TODAY AS WE GO FORWARD SECONDLY IN REGARD TO THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. IF CALIFORNIA'S SERIOUS ABOUT. RE ESTABLISHING -- THE INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE. THEN. THE FUNDING IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME FROM THE GENERAL ACCOUNT -- AND I'D SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT. THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE SOME PRIVATE FUNDING. TO SUPPORT THE ACTUAL TRADE PROMOTIONS OR TO HOST EVENTS BECAUSE CAN'T USE STATE FUNDS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY. WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY WE SET UP A FIVE OH ONE C.? THREE ENTITY -- TO FUND AND TO THOSE EVENTS -- SO THERE IS THE NEED FOR THAT [inaudible] BUT AGAIN IN TO REITERATE. THE COLLABORATION I GOT THAT I THINK A PROPOSED TO OTHER AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN THE BILL BUT SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY AS A TIME VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OKAY YES. THEY SEE THEY MAY BE QUESTIONS THAT ALONE BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT THE BILL CURRENTLY ENJOYS COMMITTEE SUPPORT BUT I TURN TO SENATOR GOT FOR A QUESTION OR COMMENT. THE OBVIOUS SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I JUST YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY ACTUALLY RAISE THE QUESTION MY MIND. WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE? NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER. TWO WITH THIS PROGRAM IS NOT BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE MISSED OUT ON OR HAVE THEY MISSED OUT ON THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR CITIZENS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BONE DIDN'T LET ME ANSWER IT THIS WAY. WHEN I WAS IN IT? THE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA WAS MEXICO THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT OTHER US STATES THAT HAD OFFICES IN MEXICO CURRENTLY THERE ARE. NINETEEN THEY'RE COMPETING IN. HAVING THE INFLUENCE IN MEXICO. AND CALIFORNIA'S NOT THERE BUT AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA TODAY HAS OVER A HUNDRED PROGRAMS. IN MEXICO THERE EITHER BEING RUN THROUGH IT THIS AT A CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. THROUGH -- COMMISSIONS AND THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEMS. NOT EVEN TO MENTION CALIFORNIA FOOD AND DRUG CAL EPA THE ENERGY COMMISSION. BUT THERE'S NO OVERALL STRATEGIC COORDINATION. BETWEEN THESE OFFICES AND AND THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. RIGHT NOW I'M FOR IT. VERY GOOD A SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU -- I I APPRECIATE AND I THINK WE'LL WE'LL WHILE MOVE THIS LEGISLATION FORD BUT I WOULD. YOU KNOW I I THINK BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I MAKE NOTE AND ANALYSIS -- BEFORE WE CLOSE THEM THE LA L. LOOKED AT AND SAID THAT THESE OFFICES DIDN'T REALLY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY -- TO EXPORTS ARE INVESTMENTS AND WELL THAT WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT'S BEEN A WHILE -- EIGHT I THANK HAVING SOME MORE EVIDENCE -- NOW REALIZE THIS BILL SAYS IT'S GONNA BE PRIVATE FUNDS ANYWAY SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT -- CURRENT STATE FUNDS BUT I I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS -- THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE -- THAT AN OFFICE LIKE THIS WOULD -- WE HAVE WOULD BRING TO IT WHETHER IT'S FROM OTHER STATES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS YOU MENTIONED AS MANY OTHER -- OFFICES THERE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT ARE THERE FROM OTHER STATES BUT IT BE GOOD IF SOMEONE COULD DO AND HOUSES OF WHICH WHAT KIND OF THEO. THE NO STATE HOUSE ONE WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY BRING THAT ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING OF GREATER BENEFIT BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANY TIGHT TIES WITH. MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS THIS WHAT'S THAT SUCH AN OFFICE WOULD DO IN ADDITION. TO WHAT WE'RE READY DOING -- WOULD BE HELPFUL SO. SO WHILE I CERTAINLY I THINK OF SUPPORT MOVING THIS BILL FOR TODAY I'D APPRECIATE HAVING MORE DATA AND EVIDENCE ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF OF OF THE OFFICE. SENATOR PENN CENTER GALGIANI. AND I WAS HERE'S A STAFF MEMBER WHEN THE TRADE AND COMMERCE AGENCY WENT AWAY IT WAS DUE TO BUDGET CUTS SO IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE -- TAKEN FROM US HOWEVER BECAUSE WE HAD TO MAKE SO MNY CUTS BACK AT THAT TIME THAT WAS ONE OF THE CASUALTIES. I'M ALIFORNIA HAS A TREMENDOUS -- ECONOMIC EXCHANGE WITH MEXICO WHEN IT WITH WHEN REGARDING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SELL I SEE A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO THIS BILL AND ALSO WHAT WE HAVE NOT -- CAPTURED IS THE POTENTIAL GROWTH THATWE COULD HAVE CAPTURED ALL THESE YEARS SINCE THE TRADE AGENCY WENT AWAY SO I AM PLEASED THAT YOU'RE DOING THE BILL -- I THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO TO DO IT EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN I HEARD LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR COULD UNLOCK THIS WAS ALSO -- WANTED TO BRING THAT BACK SO I COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON I THINK IT WILL BE A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR THE AG INDUSTRY. AND MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE STATE OF MEXICO. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI CENTER OF RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE FOR SENATOR HUESO YES PLEASE I'M AN OLD AFRICAN THEY ALL YOUR YOUR YOUR MESSAGES -- JUST TO CLOSE SO NOW IS THE TIME TO ENSURE TO MEXICO'S CIVIC BUSINESS LEADERS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VALUE ROBUST TRADE AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THEM. BY TOSSING THIS ADVISORY GROUP WITH PRIORITIZING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS STRENGTHENING OUR BY NATIONAL. ECONOMY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER GALGIANI DID I TAKE THAT AS A MOTION. I DO I HEAR MOTION FROM SENATOR GALGIANI ON MY RIGHT CALLING ALL. THE NATION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHANG. CHANG AYE ARCHULETA. PARTULA I'D DODD. NOT A GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE HILL. HILL AYE LEYVA. LIVE AYE PAN. AND I WILL ALL RIGHT WILL GUY. ALL RIGHT THE BILLS OUT. NINE ZERO THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO ARE HALF THE CENTER. I SEE -- CENTER CABALLERO YOU FOR NEXT UP. YOU ARE. WELCOME. HI THIS IS ITEM EIGHTEEN SB. SIX NINETY SEVEN THERE CABALLERO WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE HE CAN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DIE SENATORS AND PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. SIX NINETY SEVEN WHICH WILL MODERNIZE THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PRACTICE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN UNDERSERVED AREA. CALIFORNIA'S IT IS EXPECTED TO FATE FACE IT SHORTFALL OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS WITH A HUGE SEARCH SHORTAGES. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE CENTRAL COAST AND THE SOUTHERN-BORDER AREAS THIS IS DUE TO THE AN EVEN DISTRIBUTION. OF CARE ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS A LACK OF SUPPLY IN CLINICIANS. IN FACT THE STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO INCLUDED THE CALIFORNIA COULD SEE A POTENTIAL SHORTFALL. OF FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CLINICIANS AS SOON AS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHILE THERE ARE MANY PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS SB SIX NINETY SEVEN FOCUSES ON ONE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH. WORKFORCE COMMISSION REGARDING PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS FOR P. A.'S. MANY PH CURRENTLY WORK IN-HOSPITAL SETTINGS WERE ARCHAIC STATE LAWS INTERFERE WITH PRACTICE LEVEL DECISIONS ABOUT HOW PATIENT CARE TEAMS CAN BEST MEET THE QUALITY AND ACCESS NEEDS OF PATIENTS. REGULATE REGULATIONS -- THAT PA'S ARE UNDER THAT WERE WRITTEN DECADES AGO HAVE NOT PROGRESSED THE WAY PRACTICING MEDICINE HAS AND IMPOSE A BURDEN UPON BOTH THE PA AND THE PHYSICIAN. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS CREATED A DISINCENTIVE TO HIRE PA'S. THE DISINCENTIVE IS CONTRIBUTED A LACK OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ACROSS OUR STATE BUT ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN REDUCED SB SIX NINETY SEVEN WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE TH OUTMODED REQUIREMENTS THAT EACH PA WORK WITH A SINGLE PHYSICIAN. AND AND THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN PA'S AND OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS WITH SIMILAR SCOPE OF PRACTICE PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS. SPECIFICALLY -- SB SIX NINETY SEVEN WILL GRANDFATHER IN. CURRENT DELEGATION OF SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND TRANSITION PO P. H.OVER TO A STREAMLINED PRATT PRACTICE AGREEMENT AND REMOVE REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW AND CO SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REMOVE THE NUMERICAL LIMIT PAC CAN BE SUPERVISED BY A PHYSICIAN AT ANY ONE TIME AND STREAMLINED THE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES BY INCREASING PHYSICIAN TO PA RATIO TO SEX. THESE UPDATES HAVE COME FROM EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ENSURING THAT MUCH THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE UPDATE. BY MODERNIZING THE OPERATIONAL PRACTICE AND CREATING MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS THE BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE POSITIONS TO UTILIZE PA'S TO THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL WHICH WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT WITH ME TODAY IS TOM RILEY FROM. FROM THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF CASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TOM RILEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY PA'S OF FIRST WELL I WANT TO THANK SENATOR CAFIERO FOR CARRYING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. I AND HER REMARKABLE STAFF BUT HI EQUALLY A YOUR AMAZING STAFF WHO HAS ESSENTIALLY WORK THROUGH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. TO COME UP WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I JUST I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE REMARKABLE BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED -- AS WELL AS MR BELOW MENTIONED EARLIER -- TWO THINGS OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS BILL -- ONE PA'S ARE REMARKABLE -- IT INDIVIDUALS AND PROFESSIONALS DOING GOD'S WORK OUT THERE IN IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE IS DIRE NEED. PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TO HEALTH CARE -- SECOND. THIS DOES IT IN A WAY WHICH CONTINUES SUPERVISION IT ALLOWS FOR INSTEAD OF APA TO BE AN EXTENSION OF A PHYSICIAN IT ALLOWS PHD EXTENSIONS OF MANY PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. I WITH ME TODAY IS JEREMY ADLER -- WHO IS A PA OPERATING IN A SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA AND I LIKED HIM JUST TO SAY A FEW WORDS IF YOU MAY? I AM P. A GERMAN NOW THEIR PRACTICE IN SAN DIEGO AND PAIN MANAGEMENT I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICE LAST TWENTY YEARS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF P. A.'S. I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME --% TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS. THE MAYES PRACTICE WITH IS REALLY WITHIN THE DNA OF THE P. A PROFESSION THAT WE HAVE. WORK WITH PHYSICIANS AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH POSITIONS ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT REALLY SETS APART PIECES ARE FLEXIBILITY IN THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. WE ARE ALL EDUCATED -- THROUGH pGRADUATING TODAY GRADUATES WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE. AND TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE I THINK% WE ARE WELL POSITIONED. TO ENHANCE THE POWER FLEXIBILITY AT THE PRACTICE LEVEL REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT WE'RE HOPING HERE IS TO MOVE THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL. CURRENT PRACTICE TO REALLY EMPOWER A PRACTICE LEVEL DETERMINATION OF THE PA AND THE POSITION TEAM. AND WITH THAT I'M HERE CERTAINLY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REALLY JUST WANT TO ECHO THE THANKS TO THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL OF THE WORK. AND TO YOUR STAFF FOR HURT. I'M DILIGENCE AND PATIENCE AS WE WORK THROUGH ALL OF THE ISSUES OF THE SPELL -- IT IS COME A LONG WAY AND WITH THE TECHNICAL MOMENT SEE AMAZES FOR THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT DO I NEED TO USE THE MIKE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THIS BILL WERE VERY PLEASED A SUPPORT. IT AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT THAT THIS CAN HELP EXTEND PSYCHIATRIC CARE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE ONE REPRESENTING AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS I CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AMBER CAM WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU AND THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIR TO MAN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE MIRACLES EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AS WELL AS A CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THEIR COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION -- OUR FOLKS REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS THEY'VE HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS OVER THE CHANGE IN THE SUPERVISION RATIO FROM FOUR TO ONE THE SIX TO ONE I'M WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION STILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORS OF THE BILL MCGEORGE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE THAT WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OR THE NEUTRALITY YOUR ME WITH QUESTIONS OKAY. BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SENATOR HANNAH. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SACRAMENTO FOR FOR BRING THIS FORD EIGHT NOW I THINK IT MAKES SOME VERY IMPORTANT STEPS IN TERMS OF UPDATING THE AYE GUIDELINES. ON PS I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUPERVISION RATIO CHANGE. BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE MAY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE RATIO -- FOUR TO ONE COMES FROM -- ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT HOW MANY -- PHYSICIANS A A SO IN RESIDENCY TRAINING I WAS THE REST OF THE TRAIN DIRECTOR -- WE WERE NOT PERMITTED -- TO SURPRISE MORE THAN. FOUR FOR PRESENTS HIS ACTIONS AT A TIME AND AND STILL BELT MEDICARE AND THAT WAS THE CMS GUIDELINES. AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW I I DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MORE CONSIDERS SOME CONSIDERATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT IS THAT NUMBER IN THE END -- BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEN YOU'RE JUST A NAME ON A PIECE OF PAPER IT'S NOT SUPER VISION ISN'T ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND I THINK WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE SOME PREVIOUS HEARINGS. I THINK AT NE POINT DOES PROPOSAL THAT WELL SINCE YOU COULD DO FOR YOU COULD DO FOR IN SEASON FOUR PA'S NOW YOU NOW CAN SUPERVISE TWELVE PEOPLE ON REALISTICALLY. AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD PASSED THE SUPERVISORS AT SHE HAD TO SUPERVISE -- OTHER UP SPECIALS PARTICULARLY ACTUALLY INCLUDING OTHER PHYSICIANS. THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT WHERE YOU'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO TRULY SUPERVISE AND AND AND AND AND SO -- THAT IS AN AREA THAT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- BECAUSE THE FOR DEBT IF THERE'S A BASIS FOR THE FOR SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE BASIS FOR THE SIXES. AND BEING SURE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE SOME. BECAUSE THIS THAT DOESN'T ONLY AFFECT THIS BILL RIGHT WITH P. A.'S BUT ALSO THEN START TALKING ABOUT WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS RATIO AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. EXACTLY WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD EXPECTED OF THE SUPERVISOR AND TO BE SURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE SUPERVISION. AND THAT WE MAINTAIN PATIENT SAFETY SO I MEAN I I SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL AND THE OTHER PROVISIONS I THINK YOU KNOW IT AGAIN MAKES SENSE -- BUT I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO ON THE RATIO -- SO IS THE FORD THERE WAS A RATIONALE FOR THAT -- THE SIX I'D BE I'D APPRECIATE HAVING -- MORE DATA OR EVIDENCE AS TO WHY SIX IS OKAY AND AMOUNT OF WHAT THE WORKLOAD EXPECTED AS A SUPERVISOR EXAMPLE AT SIX IS A SURPRISED AND NOT DO ANY CLINICAL WORK SO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE -- THAT'S GONNA BE IT SHOULD BE A QUESTION SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE SPENDING ALL THE TIME. AND THEN THEY'RE NOT SUPERVISING RIGHT SO EXACTLY WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION THAN OF THE SUPERVISOR OF WHEN YOU HAVE SIX PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF AND ALL THE PATIENTS ARE TO IF IT'S REALLY ALL THE PATIENTS ARE TAKING CARE OF ME AND SHOULD BE SURE THAT YOU. CAN REVIEW AND BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BEING MISSED AND SO FORTH. WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR -- SWIMBAIT THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THIS BILL IS TAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE AT THE PRACTICE LEVEL -- THAT ARE OW DICTATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE PRACTICE LEVEL. AND SAYING. IF YOU SEEN ONE PRACTICE YOU SEEN ONE PRACTICE WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT -- WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS AND WE ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR MEETING PATIENT NEEDS. AND SO MUCH OF THE FLEXIBILITY IN THIS BILL COMES. TO THE PRESS IT TO THE PRACTICE LEVEL TO PUT IN. THOSE. SIGN DOCUMENTS THIS IS WHAT YOU MAY DO AND WHAT YOU MAY NOT DO. IN IN PASSING THAT FROM THE STATE TO THE PRACTICE WE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS -- WITH THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND WITH OTHERS ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THOSE RATIOS OUGHT TO BE -- AT MY I'M NOT GIVING AWAY ANY SECRETS MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAID WE ARE ON RECORD AS HAVING SUPPORTING ONE TO SIX RATIO -- IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE P. A COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE WE'RE ON THAT SAME PAGE IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT A PRACTICE THAT ALL PRACTICES ARE IMMEDIATELY GOING TO GO TO A ONE SIX RATIONS. SOME MAY BE A ONE TO ONE RATIO SOME MAY BE WE HAVE A NEW PHYSICIAN. AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THAT POSITION SHOULD BE SUPERVISING ANY. WE HAVE A NEW P. A. N. WE THINK THAT THAT P. A. SHOULD BE VERY CAREFULLY SUPERVISED IN DE. THAT ENDED CERTAINLY. I THINK THIS IS AN HOUR LIMIT RIGHT SO I WAS EACH PRACTICE SITUATION BUT I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT WHERE THAT OUR LIMIT -- WE NEED TO FIGURE OT WHERE THAT LINE IS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEN YOU ARE TO USE THAT YOU AND I MEAN THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT'S REASON WHY CMS HAD THOSE GUIDELINES. THEY SAID WE REALLY WANT YOU WE DO KNOW. THAT PROTECT PATIENTS WE NEED TO BE SURE TO ACTUAL SUPERVISION GOING ON SO THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME -- EXAMINATION OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO SUPERVISE EVEN AT THAT HOUR LIMIT SO THAT. ACTUALLY THERE IS APPROPRIATE PATIENT SAFETY SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE AND I THINK CERTAINLY THAT'S ROLE FOR THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A RACIAL THE FIRST PLACE ALWAYS WOULD JUST SAY FOR WHATEVER BUT AND AND SO I THINK. WE'LL. IT'D BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A BETTER IDEAAS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOW WE STAB WISH THAT NUMBER -- SO IS THAT THERE WAS A RATIONALE FOR THE ONE FOUR ONE CAN ARGUE HOW GOOD OF A RATIONALE BUT WE'RE GOING TO THAT ONE THE SIX I MEAN BEEN SOMEONE'S GONNA PROPOSE. ONE EIGHT ON THE TEN AT WHAT PUT YELP. SO AND AND REALIZE ALSO THE OTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IT SERVE DECREASES SOME OF THE I GUESS ALL PAPERWORK WORKLOAD RIGHT SIGNING STUFF LIKE THAT SO. BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL SUPERVISION I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE ESTABLISHED RATIOS THAT ARE THAT WILL STILL PROTECT PATIENTS. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OUT LAWCENTER COVER I REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A BILL BEFORE YOU INTRODUCED IT NICE TODAY ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A BIG HEAVY LEFT IT SEEMS LIKE TECHNICAL AND SMALL BUT DISCOVER PRAXIS IS CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TRY TO MOVE. AHEAD YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD FIND COMMON GROUND -- AND YOU HAVE. AND I THINK THAT THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. IS A REFLECTION OF OF YOUR HARD WORK OF THE THE SUPPORTERS AND THE CERTAINLY OUR STAFF HERE AT THE COMMITTEE. I TO GET US TO THIS PLACE WHERE THERE'S SOME STILL QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BUT THEY FOR THE MOST PART I THINK THIS BILL. HAS REALLY MOVE FORWARD IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY IN AN IMPORTANT WAY. AS WE WORK. TO PROTECT PATIENT SAFETY AND HEALTH BUT ALSO TRY TO LOWER COST HEALTH CARE COSTS WHICH WE KNOW ARE BECOMING BIGGER AND BIGGER BIRDS I APPLAUD YOU AND THE SPONSORS AND ALL THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS SO FAR TO TO BRING THE BILL TO ITS CURRENT.

WHO WORKED -- QUITE VIGOROUSLY TO HELP IMPROVE HIS BILL. IT HAS BEEN AMENDED THIS MORNING THE VISION REMAINS THE SAME BUT SOME OF THE EXECUTION OF THAT VISION HAS BEEN CHANGED A BIT. SO HERE'S THE VISION THE VISION OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER CITIES AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. TERMS OF ATTRACTING EVENTS -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS ON SPORTING EVENTS AND THAT'S PART OF IT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. OUR CINEMATIC EVENTS AGRICULTURAL EVENTS -- OTHER PERFORMANCES OTHER FESTIVALS THAT KIND OF THING THAT ARE BEING STAGED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA. NEEDS TO BE COMPETITIVE THE VISION THE BILL WAS TO PROVIDE. AN INCENTIVE FOR CITIES TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT THESE KINDS OF EVENTS. BY EXTENDING ALONE IT'S BEEN CHANGED. AND AND SO YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THE CHANGE THE CHANGES IS TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE TO BASICALLY EXAMINE THIS ISSUE AS TO HOW WE CAN MAKE. CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COMMUNITIES COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER CITIES AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THE TASK FORCE IS TASKED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY EXPLORING THIS ISSUE. AND REPORTING BACK TO LEGISLATURE -- WE HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES HERE WITH US TODAY. TESTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE BILL -- MISTER BURSTS OF WITH THE ANAHEIM OF VISIT AMERICA ANAHEIM THANK YOU J. FOR BEING HERE. AND AND ALSO CASSANDER COSTELLO WITH VISIT SAN FRANCISCO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHAMBER US AND I REPRESENT VISIT ANAHEIM AS WELL AS THE ORANGE COUNTY VISITORS SOCIAIS SHIN. AND A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE DO THIS SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY SIX THIS TYPE OF FUND IS NOT NEW TO OUR INDUSTRY. IN FACT SIMILAR PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE IN TEXAS AND LOUISIANA IN A RECENT ONE JUST PASSED IN OHIO -- I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD WITH THE WITH THE PROGRAM WITH IN TEXAS THE PROGRAM IN TEXAS IS INTENDED FOR TWO CATEGORIES. ONE OF THE INTENDED FOR MEGA EVENTS SUCH AS A SUPERBOWL. THE OTHER EVENTS TRUST FUND WAS INTENDED TO GROW THE AMATEUR SPORTS MARKET FROM NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS TO OLYMPIC QUALIFYING TYPE. EVENTS. THE PHONE STRUCTURE LOT FOR HOSTING ENTITIES APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF FUNDS NECESSARY TO SECURE AND HOST THE EVENT. REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED ON INCREMENTAL TAX DOLLARS THAT WERE COLLECTED BY THE STATE DUE TO THE HOSTING THE EVENT. THEY COULD NOT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOSTED IN ANOTHER STATE. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A LARGE DESTINATION IN DALLAS AND A SMALLER DESTINATION IN OR ARLINGTON WE WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS FOR SUPERBOWL AN NBA ALL STAR GAME. A FINAL FOUR BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE AMERICAN CUTTING HORSE EVENT ALSO HELD IN THE DALLAS FORT WORTH AREA. WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO ADD THE ACADEMY OF COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS TO THE EVENTS TRUST FUND TO THE IMPACT RESULTING AND HOSTING OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY SHOW. MOVING FROM LAS VEGAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE IN FACT WE WON THE BID AGAINST A COMPETING CALIFORNIA CITY. THE LARGER IMPACT WAS ON SMALLER DESTINATIONS WHICH WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUND TO HOST AMATEUR SPORTS EVENTS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THESE EVENTS REQUIRE BID FEES AND OTHER HOSTING COST WHICH SYMBOL SMALLER DESTINATIONS DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH FUNDS. THE EVENTS TRUST FUND ALLOWED CITIES SUCH AS COLLEGE STATION IN ARLINGTON TEXAS. TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER SIMILAR CITIES AND OTHER STATES. RESULTING IN A BOOMING SPORTS MARKET IN TEXAS POSITIVELY IMPACTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND YOUTH WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. EACH YEAR DOZENS OF CULTURAL SPORTING AGRICULTURAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR HOTELS. RESTAURANTS RETAIL AND TRANSPORTATION AND CREATE AN EXPANSIVE SHOWCASE FOR THE HOST CITY AND COUNTY. THESE EVENTS FOSTER INNOVATION AND ENCOURAGE SPILLOVER EFFECTS THAT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES BY ATTRACTING INVESTMENT. TOURISM CONSUMER SPENDING AND GENERATING NEW TAX REVENUES.

TO START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH -- MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THIS BILL SB FIVE FIVE SIX AMENDS THE PROFESSIONAL LAND SURVEYORS ACT. LAND SURVEYING IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL TRADE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY INVOLVES A PERFORMANCE OF SURVEYS USING MATHEMATICS AND THE AND PHOTO GRANT CHEMISTRY THIS DEVILISH PROPERTY LINES ARE THE BOUNDARIES OF ANY PARCEL OF LAND RIGHT OF WAY AND EASEMENTS. THESE BOUNDARIES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE ENTRE PROJECT TO ENSURE CONSTRUCTION PLANS ARE BEING FOLLOWED CORRECTLY. HOWEVER THE BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS LANCER IS A GEOLOGIST AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE SEEING AN INCREASE AND UNLICENSED ACTIVITY DUE TO THE BAD SO ATTRACTED KNOWLEDGE HE WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL TERMS IN THE ACT. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD CLARIFY THESE TECHNICAL TERMS REFLECT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE FIELD AND CLOSE LOOPHOLES IN THE ACCESS DECADES OLD DEFINITIONS OF LAND SURVEYING WORK. DEFINITIONS OF WHO MAY OR MAY NOT PERFORM SUCH WORK THIS BILL IS NOT TO CONSTRAIN A LIMIT THE PRACTICES OF OTHER CRAFTS OR TRADES IN THE FIELD BUT THE CRACKDOWN ON UNLICENSED ACTIVITIES. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ENHANCE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS LAND SURVEYORS AND GEOLOGISTS AND OTHER STATE LICENSING BOARDS BY REQUIRING THAT VALLEY COMPLAINTS OF UNLICENSED LANCER ACTIVITIES. ARE SHARED WITH BOARDS THAT REGULATE HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND BOARDS THAT REGULATE WAGES AND OTHER LABOR REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. I WOULD MENTION HERE THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME FEEDBACK ABOUT THE TERM VALID COMPLAINTS NEED TO BE NARROWED DOWN IN OUR OFFICE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL OR COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE BOARD AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. FINALLY THIS BOARD WOULD ENSURE EMPLOYER ACCOUNTABILITY BY ESTABLISHING A CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORITY THAT BUSINESS WHICH IN FOR FORMS ARE OFFERS PERFORMED LAND SURVEYING MUST OBTAIN PRIOR TO OFFERING THOSE SERVICES AND AUTHORIZES THE BOARD TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A NEW FIND FOR A BUSINESS ACTING AS A PROFESSIONAL LAND SURVEYING WITHOUT.

FRESH LIABILITY STILL FOLLOWS THE LICENSEE. WHERE THERE IS NO CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO THAT BUSINESS PRACTICES BEING USED -- AGAINST US LICENSEES SO ESTABLISHING SOME CORPORATE LIABILITY IS.

MY BOARD IS UNSURE OF THE DIRECTION OF A QUOTA -- AS STATED -- FROM ONE OF MY MY MEMBERS WHO IS ACTUALLY AN ATTORNEY -- HE'S CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF PUTTING ACCORDION TO SEE PATIENTS AND WHETHER THIS IS A RESTRICTION ON A BUSINESS PRACTICES GOOD. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WILL ASK THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THAT IN A MOMENT ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD THE NEXUS FACE YOU'RE IN THE DAY AS FOR FOR HER PLEASE [inaudible] HELLO. AFTERNOON AT MERION CAM WITH A CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION A CDA IS APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK SENATOR CHIANG HAS MADE ON THIS BILL AND MOLLY HAVING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. POSITION FOR THE BILL AND PRINT -- WE ANTICIPATE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND SUPPORTING IF AMENDED BASED ON THE I SENATORS OPENING STATEMENT COMMITMENTS -- AND WELL AMENDMENTS ARE BEING TAKEN ON THE D. H. M. P. S. A. R. DIPSET LANGUAGE ISSUES CDA MAINTAINS THAT THE OFFERED 15% THRESHOLD. OF FOR THE RT HEP MEDI CAL PATIENT MIX IS JUST SIMPLY TOO LOW AND BELIEVE THAT A MINIMUM OF 30% THRESHOLD SHOULD BE SET TO PRESERVE THE INTENDED. FUNCTION OF THE ALREADY A TO A P. -- WHICH IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PERIODONTAL AND PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED AREAS AND POPULATIONS. AS ONE THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING 50% OF ALL CHILDREN ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE AL. A 30% SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY REASONABLE MINIMUM TO INSURED CONTINUED CAN YOU CONTINUED COMMUNITY ACCESS BY AN ARTY HEP. WHILE ALSO RESPECTING THE NEED FOR A BALANCED PATIENT MIX FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICE. OF THIS 30% THRESHOLD WOULD ALSO BE IN WHAT IS -- IN LINE FOR WHAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED FOR DENNIS PARTICIPATING IN A STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FUNDED BY PROP -- FIFTY SIX FOR DIRT FOR DENNIS PRACTICING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M CA ALSO HAS CONCERNS ABOUT TWO OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL SURROUNDING THE REMOVAL OF DENNIS SUPERVISION. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PLACEMENT OF INTO -- INTERIM THERAPEUTIC RESTORATIONS OR TEMPORARY FILLINGS OR IT OURS. AND LOCAL ANESTHESIA FOR RTG PEAS. I'M ALREADY CHECK AP'S CONTEND THAT THEY DON'T NEED AN THE SUPERVISION OF A DENTIST FOR THE I. T. R. PLACEMENT BECAUSE THEY PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE AND APPEARS TO BE A POINT OF CONFUSION. ARE THE LAWS DOUBLE XING THE RTG P. POINTEDLY DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN DENTAL HYGIENE IN THE TREATMENT OF DENTAL DISEASES WHICH REQUIRED THE I'M DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PLANNING OF A DENTIST. I'M THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK IS ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE RTG P. AS A TEAM OF DENTAL CARE PROVIDERS -- EACH HAS A ROLE IN OUR ALL NECESSARY FOR PATIENTS TO SEE -- AND RECEIVE THE FULL RANGE OF CARE THAT THEY NEED. LASTLY PERMITTING THE PROVISION OF LOCAL ANESTHESIA WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A DENTIST FOR TYPICALLY MORE MEDICALLY COMPLEX PATIENTS LEAVES ALREADY JP'S WITHOUT THE SUPPORT THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED AT INPATIENT SETTINGS. DURING EMERGENCIES SUCH AS BACK UP TEAM MEMBERS AND ANASTASIA REVERSAL DRUGS. CDA WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPER EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS AND ARE PUT INTO PLACE FOR ALL SETTINGS WERE RTG PEAS PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. I AM I WILL BE CONTINUING WITH CONVERSATIONS WITH CCHA TO FURTHER REFINE THIS LANGUAGE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OF MERRY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT ARE WE GIVE THE AT THE SPONSORED THE SENATOR. BUT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED HAVE MY SPONSOR COURSE. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ON THE LANGUAGE AND A COUPLE OF THINGS THE AS FAR AS REMOVING THE SUPERVISION COMPONENT FOR THE I. T. OURS THE I. T. OURS AND ARE DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH A DENTIST IT'S USED A A TELEHEALTH MODEL. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM TO REFINE THAT LANGUAGE I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AT SOME POINT PUTTING IN LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. HAVE THEM COLLABORATE SINCE THE ALREADY ALREADY HA P. DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT IN STATUTE -- THEY FELT IT WAS CONFUSING TO ADD TO IT AND YOU KNOW HAVE SUPERVISION AND THIS -- ONE AT PROVISION WHEN THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE SO WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH CDA MORE ON THAT -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO A THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU FIND ACOSTA BILL. WELL I THINK THE WITNESS THAT AT THE THAT WAY SEE IS IS THAT -- OTHER PLACES WHERE WE IN TERMS OF ACCESS MY TIME UNDER SING HOMES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS SO BUT NOW I'VE MAKE NOTE THAT. I THINK A. B. BUT THAT VAST MAJORITY OF OUR NURSING HOME PATIENTS ACTUALLY ARE ON THAT A CAL SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST THE SO OVERALL WE WERE ABOUT THIRD PEOPLE MEDI CAL BUT HALF OF ALL CHILDREN. EVEN HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN NURSING HOME CARE SO I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I DO HAVE IS. HITTING A 30% THRESHOLD SHOULD BE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE IN THOSE SETTINGS IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE 3% THRESHOLD AND SO CITY HA IS CONCERNED WITH THE THRESHOLD. IS THAT IT REALLY -- SETS A PRECEDENT NO OTHER. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IS MANDATED BY THE STATE TO HAVE A CERTAIN PACE ELATION BUT BUT JUST BUT JUST TO CLARIFY THIS ONLY APPLIES. IN NON HIP SAID AREAS TO SOMEONE SO RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T AND DO YOU CAN READ ME LIKE READ THE BILL THAT OF SAYS REMOVED RIGHT TO HIT JUST YEAH SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT SITUATIONS WITH THE HIP SAYS YOU'VE BEEN REMOVED HERE HIPS AREAS THERE'S NO. PERCENTAGE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BY DEFINITION THAT'S A LOW SO. THIS THIS IS THE PROVISION WHICH BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BASICALLY I THINK THERE'S A WILL THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF CONFUSION I'M JANITOR BUT THE THE BOARD SAID I MEAN THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. YOUR HELP SO YOU'RE FINE IF YOU AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REMOVED THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME IT'S FEDERAL. THAN -- THEN THEN YOU CAN'T PRACTICE I MEAN THIS IS WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A MIDDLE GROUND HERE BECAUSE I THINK THE PURPOSE WAS IS AND ACTUALLY THE SAID THAT THE SETTINGS REALLY ARE THE ONES THAT I'M HEARING DESCRIBED THINGS LIKE SCHOOLS AND NURSING HOMES. THOSE ARE VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE MEDI CAL SITES ANYWAY TO START WITH SO. THAT'S WHY MIKE WHY IS 30% A PROBLEM. SO CITY HA IS WILLING TO WORK WITH CD A ON THE ON THAT LANGUAGE. AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THAT CONCERN OF OPENING IT UP THAT WOULD MANDATE PROVIDERS SEE A CERTAIN PAPER PATIENT POPULATIONS AWAY TONIGHT CLASS WERE BUT WE'RE TOTALLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WILLING TO PUT THAT THRESHOLD BACK IN THE BILL. AND AND OKAY SO BECAUSE AFFINITY SO. THE ISSUE ISN'T THE PERCENTAGE THAT ISSUES THE PROVISION OR THE ISSUE THE PERCENTAGE FIGURE OUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE ISSUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF THAT WE'D ALL EVERYONE AGREED ON THE PROVISION. BUT YOUR OBJECTION IS ACTUALLY TO HAVING THAT PROVISION THE FIRST PLACE. I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING IT BACK IN BASICALLY DOES OKAY SO THERE IS NOT A IT'S NOT CALLED THE PROVISION ISN'T THE PROBLEM IT'S THE PERCENTAGE. OKAY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT OKAY AND AND I GUESS I'M RAISING WHAT'S WRONG 30%. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND 30% IS MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE MORE AT THE HIGHER PERCENTAGE YOU HAVE OF PATIENTS IN YOUR POPULATION THAT YOU NEED TO TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PATIENT. ANY HARD TO TRACK IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE HIGH JENIS TO TRACK THAT -- THE PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE EQUALLY DIFFICULT ATTRACTION OR WHAT THE PERCENTAGES I MEAN IN TERMS OF BY THAT SHE IS THAT PERCENTAGE. THAT MAY BE BUT AS A SET OF AT THE POPULATIONS ARE THE ONES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. CHILDREN ARE 50% OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS RIGHTS OF YOU DOING SCHOOLS QUESTION BE TO DIFFICULT. NURSING HOMES. I THINK 80% SO. 30% SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM -- WE'RE NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WHY HEARING IS MAINLY FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY READY HALF FOR THE BIGGEST ACCESS PROBLEMS. JERRY HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE MEDI CAL PATIENTS -- SO I I THINK THAT FOR ME AT THE CENTER PAN MAKES A VERY GOOD POINT LET ME JUST ASK OR CLARIFICATION SO. FROM CTA'S POINT OF YOU YOU'VE RACED. FIVE ISSUES. ONE OF THE WHICH IS THE THRESHOLD AND FOR OTHERS BUT IS THE IS YOURS. OPPOSITION REMOVAL OF YOUR OPPOSITION BASED ON THE THRESHOLD CHANGE. AND THE OTHERS WITH OUR CONCERNS THAT YOU THINK ARE YOUR WORKING ON WITH THE WITH THE AUTHOR IS THAT SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT SO WE WE RAISE THREE ISSUES THERE IS THE DIPSET DESIGNATION -- THAT THE PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT THERE IS THE I. T. R. GENERAL SUPERVISION AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE SUPERVISION FOR LOCAL ANESTHESIA BOTH OF WHICH FOR EACH AB IS. AN THE THE POSITION OF MOVING BACK TO SUPPORT OF AMENDED WAS BASED ON ADDING THE DIPS A INFORMATION -- OR THAT IF THE DEFINITION BACK INT THE LANGUAGE BUT ON ALL THREE ARE ARE DEFINITE CONCERNS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT BUT IF THE AUTHOR MOVED THE THRESHOLD OF 30%. BUT THAT REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION IF. IF IT SO THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT SHOULD THAT SENATOR CHIANG IS PUTTING BACK AND WE WILL BE BACK TO WE ANTICIPATE BACK TO A SUPPORT AMENDED. CENTER CHANGE YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT THEN ARE YOU ABLE TO COME TO THAT THAT WE ABLE TO GET TO THE SPACE HERE. RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATION I KNOW BUT SPECIFICALLY TO THAT IS THAT THE FOR WE'RE STILL ASKING 430% PRESSES YOUR ANGLE WITH HAVING THE PROVISION OF ALL I THINK IT WAS THERE WERE 930%. WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH 15% WE'RE LOOKING 430% BUT WE WILL MOVE OUR POSITION TO SUPPORT IF AMENDED. WITH THE 15% LANGUAGE THAT WAS OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS. BUT WE WANT 30% CORRECT. WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WE WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THAT PROVISION BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE PERCENTAGE. AS WELL AND ARE COMFORTABLE YOU GUYS A COMFORTABLE I MEAN RIGHT THAT'S ONE OF OUR MENACES RIGHT THE AMENDMENT OF MOVING FROM CLARIFY WHETHER YOU ARE MOVING FROM OPPOSITION. TO SUPPORT WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS THE AUTHOR HAS PROPOSED TODAY WE ARE. FAR YEAH YES. AND THAT IS THAT THE THOSE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED AT A THRESHOLD OF 15% AT 30%. RIGHT SOURCE SUPPORT OF AMENDED STILL WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE YOU WOULD EXIST PORT OF AMENDED. YOU WOULD ONLY SUPPORTED 30%. WRECKED WALDRON NOW NOTE NOW WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE AMENDED FOR THE THREE ISSUES. THE DIP SERVING FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY AND THE OTHER. TWO THOUGH. SO OKAY YOU ARE CONFUSING ME NOW YEAH. YEAH I JUST RE OKAY [inaudible] THAT -- YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. YEAH SO IT'S NOT IN OPPOSE IS NOT IT'S NOT WE WERE IT RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S AN OPPOSE UNLESS. AMENDMENT ADDED AND THE SUFFIX. TO WE HAVE THREE CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING TAKEN RIGHT NOW. WE'LL BE IN SUPPORT OF AMENDED. THIS MORE OF A NEUTRAL. OR OKAY THAT'S THE CONFUSION BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING IF YOU TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE SUPPORT IF IF AMENDED. WHICH IT CREATES THIS COMPUTER BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL THINKING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. OKAY AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH CD EIGHT SO THAT'S A NEW ONE FOR ME I GUESS. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES SENATOR PAN SIDE FROM THE RATIO -- THE PASSAGE OF US I AS THE SHOW IT'S A LOCAL ANESTHESIA AND YELLING. IN ORDER THERE WILL LOOK. LIKE YOU TALK TO AND OF THERE SO THE LOCAL ANESTHESIA AND SO WHAT -- SO THERE'S THIS THEIR NEW. NEW AUTHORITIES AND BILL NOW OKAY EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THE ISSUE CURETTAGE AND LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN NURSING HOMES AND THE HOMES OF THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. I'M NOT SCHOOLS -- IN IN DENTAL AND MEDICAL SETTINGS AND THIS WOULD HELP ADDRESS -- WORKING WITH ELDERLY PATIENTS THAT MAY NEED THOSE DEEPER CLEANINGS AND LOCAL ANESTHESIA PROVIDES -- PAIN RELIEF WE ARE NOT INCLUDING THE NITROUS OXIDE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THAT CHANGES YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS -- BUT THE LOCAL ANESTHESIA WAS A WAY TO ADD ADDITIONAL PAIN RELIEF FOR THOSE. ELDERLY PATIENTS THAT NEED THE DEEPER LEANINGS OKAY SO ON ONE LEVEL I APPRECIATE. THE IMPORTANCE OF PAIN RELIEF. HI BUT I'M ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS. AND A ONE BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT SCIENTISTS ARE YOU WORKING WITH THAT CA ON THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT ANY WE WANTED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO SENIORS BUT WE DON'T ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S OUT THERE. DOING SOMETHING AND THEN THEY GET IN TROUBLE AND THEY DON'T HAVE BACK UP. TO THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS. SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR IN AND IT SEEMS LIKE. THERE'S THERE'S COMPROMISED THERE AT SOME LEVEL AND IT MAY GET TO THE FULL AMOUNT OF MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE WE MOVE THE BILL FOR TODAY. AND WITH THE SERVE IF IT CANNOT BE RESOLVED IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE TO YOU COULD BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT SOME POINT IN TIME AS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING. I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION. THE BILL GOING GREAT WISDOM -- BUT THE I'M A GIVE CENTER CHIANG AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE AND WE'LL SEE IF WE HAVE A MOTION TO DO JUST. THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK FOR ON BECAUSE WE WILL DEFINITELY BE WORKING WITH CDA AND JUST A SIDE NOTE I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE. DENTISTS AND DENTAL HYGIENISTS OF THIS HAS BEEN A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION. WELL -- BUT WITH THAT I I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY THANK THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG SO. SENATOR HILL SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO TAKE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- BUT TO ASK THAT THE FURTHER UNABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES -- PRIOR TO APPROPRIATIONS THAT THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO GET BACK TO THE CONVERSATION HERE AS A COMMITTEE OKAY WITH THAT.

YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US LAST WEEK TO COME UP WITH THE NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL AND MORE CONCISE. AND WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF THANK YOU. SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES VETERINARIANS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOMMEND THE USE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR MEDICINAL USE ON THEIR ANIMAL PATIENTS. PETS OUR FURRY FRIENDS SUFFER FROM MANY OF THE SAME IF NOT SIMILAR AILMENTS HUMANS DO AND WHICH MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. SINCE VETERINARIANS ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED ON HOW THEY CAN DISCUSS THE USE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS LET ALONE PROVIDE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON DOSAGE OR APPLICATION OF PRODUCTS. PET OWNERS WOULD LIKE TO TREAT THEIR ANIMALS OFTEN TURN TO THE INTERNET FOR ADVICE OR SEEN SIMPLY SEEK THE COUNSEL OF THE RETAIL CANNABIS CLERK. BEHIND THE COUNTER OR MAKE GUESSES. INSTEAD OF HAVING ACCURATE RECOMMENDATIONS. RATHER THAN GETTING THE ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL THEIR LOCAL VETERINARIAN PET OWNERS ARE UNINTENTIONALLY PUTTING THEIR PETS HEALTH AND SAFETY AND DANGER. ANIMAL CAN AVOID RECEPTORS SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM HUMANS SO DOSAGES MUST BE ADJUSTED FOR THE TYPE OF ANIMAL ITS WEIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITION YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT ANIMALS PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE USE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND TO ALLOW THOSE VETERINARIANS WHO WISH TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON CANNABIS USE. I AM PRESENTING SB. SIX TWENTY SEVEN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE IS PROVIDED A SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH CLARIFY THE DIRECTION OF SB. SIX TWENTY SEVEN SO THAT IT FITS WITHIN A FRAMEWORK SIMILAR TO THE ADOPTION OF MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR HUMANS. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND THEY ASKED THE VET VETERINARIAN MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADOPT GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS FOR AN ANIMAL PATIENT I AM ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU. LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MEASURE SIMPLY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THOSE VETERINARIANS WHO CHOOSE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF CANNABIS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. I RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL VETERINARIANS WILL WANT TO DO SO. AND LASTLY THE MEASURE PROVIDES PEACE OF MIND TO THOSE PET OWNERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY USING CAMPUS PRODUCTS ON THEIR PETS AND FOR THOSE PET OWNERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS ON THEIR PETS. THAT THEY CAN SPEAK WITH AND RECEIVE A MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION FROM THE VETERINARIAN THE MOST TRUSTED AND QUALIFIED PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PETS HEALTH. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE PAUL HANSBERRY AND SUSAN TEVIN FROM LOVINGLY AND LEGALLY WHO SPONSORED THIS LEGISLATION AND ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI.

THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT PERSONS WITH UNSATISFIED JUDGMENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN LICENSURE. WITHOUT FIRST SATISFYING THAT JUDGMENT. REGARDING THE CONTRACTORS BOND STUDY AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THIS BILL. REQUIRES THE BOARD TO CONCLUDE THE STUDY BY. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STUDY COMPLETED SOONER AND WE'LL SEE COMMANDMENTS REQUIRE MORE EXPEDITIOUS TIME FRAME. I'M REALLY THINKING ABOUT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE I HAVE WITH ME MICHAEL -- JAM THAT SKI FROM THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT ABOUT. WITNESSES AND MARK. I THE BOARD AS AN ADD OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ON THE ON THE BILL YEAH BUT WE ANTICIPATED SUPPORT POSITION BY A COMMITTEE IN MAY AND BY THE FULL BOARD GEN. WHICH YOU MARKETS AND NOT BE HAVE THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE AMERICAN FOR SPRINKLER ASSOCIATION ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE AND THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. BUSTLE MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE FLOWS. THREE I'VE OF WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. SENATOR HILL HAS MOVED THE BILL. OF SECRETARY WILL CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE GLAZER AYE. GLAZER AYE CHANGE. FIVE AYE ARCHULETA HI FRAUDULENT AYE DODD. NOT AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE HILL HILL AYE LEYVA. FAN WILL [inaudible] LOOK I WE HAVE FIVE SEVEN ZERO WE'RE GONNA HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. NEXT UP I BELIEVE IS THE FINAL BILL SB. SIX SEVENTEEN SEVEN EASIEST ONE FOR LACK. THE THANK YOU VICE CHAIR. SB. SEVEN SIX SEVENTEEN I WOULD ALLOW PHARMACISTS IN A RETAIL SETTING. TO SUPERVISE UP TO THREE PHARMACY TECHNICIANS IF. IF THEY MEET CERTAIN BENCHMARKS AND HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. TWO BIG REQUIREMENTS THERE HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN BENCHMARKS AND OF THE APPROVAL FROM THE STATE PART OF BOARD OF PHARMACY. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A SINGLE PHARMACISTS TO SUPERVISE ONE TECHNICIAN. RIGHT ONE TECHNICIAN. EACH ADDITIONAL PHARMACISTS IN A GIVENLOCATION CAN SUPERVISE UP TO TWO TECHNICIANS. THESE RULES ARE OUTDATED. AND LONG OVERDUE FOR A CHANGE. NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO A TASK FORCE OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY. RECOMMENDED THE ELIMINATION OF PHARMACIST TECHNICIAN RATIOS THAT'S RIGHT TWENTY YEARS AGO. THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS BASED ON A STUDY OF THE PROFESSION WHICH FOUND THAT PHARMACISTS. WERE SPENDING MOST OF THEIR TIME ON ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. THAT REQUIRED NEITHER THEIR CLINICAL TRAINING. NOR THEIR JUDGMENT. SINCE THAT TIME MOST STATES HAVE FOLLOWED THE RECOMMENDATION. THEY HAVE EITHER NO LIMITS ON PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. RATIOS OR MUCH HIGHER LIMITS THAN CALIFORNIA. RATIOS OF THREE TO ONE FOUR TO ONE AND EVEN SIX TO ONE ARE COMMON. BUT CALIFORNIA REMAIN STUCK IN THE ERA. WHEN THE USE OF PHARMACY TECHNICIANS WAS STRICTLY LIMITED? THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THIS LIMIT. FORCES PHARMACIST PERFORM DUTIES THAT DISTRACT THEM FROM THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE AND OF COURSE THEIR EXPERTISE. PHARMACY TECHNICIANS UNDERGO SPECIALIZED TRAINING. AT OUR LICENSE BY THE PHARMACY BOARD TO PERFORM TASKS THAT REQUIRE THE SUPERVISION. BUT NOT THE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF A LICENSED PHARMACIST. SB SIX SEVENTEEN INCLUDES A SERIES OF REQUIREMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT TECHNICIANS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED AND SUPERVISED. AND THAT THEY PERFORM ONLY THOSE DUTIES TO WHICH THEIR LICENSE. AND NO MORE. AN EXTRA MEASURE OF SAFETY. THE HIGHER RATIOS WOULD BE ALLOWED ONLY. IN RETAIL PHARMACIES UNDER A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. WITH THE PHARMACIST. THE PHARMACY TECHNICIANS ARE BOTH. THE PHARMACY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO USE THESE RATIOS ONLY IF THEY DEMONSTRATE TO THE PHARMACY BOARD. THAT THEY HAVE MET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS. INCLUDING SHOWING THAT THE TECHNICIANS WILL BE WORKING. UNDER THE QUOTE IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SUPERVISION. UNQUOTE OF THE PHARMACIST. THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE RELIEF FOR PHARMACISTS CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND TECHNICAL TRAINING. AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO PATIENTS. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY MARK JOHNSON. CALIFORNIA LICENSE PHARMACIST AND FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. AND JACQUI LEVEL. PRESIDENT OF UFCW LOCAL. EIGHT WHICH REPRESENTS ALL OF THOSE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION OF FOR THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. THIS IS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] FIRST OF MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX ONE SEVEN MY NAME'S ACTUALLY JACQUES GLOBAL NOT JACQUI LEVEL -- BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THE NAME SHOCK HE ANSWERED ENDING STARTS WITH A J. -- AND PRESIDENT OF YOUR CW A GOLDEN STATE -- AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS. ON AND ON BEHALF OF THE U. OF C. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. WHICH HAS OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND MEMBERS ON I WANT TO BEGIN BY FIRST THEY CAN SENATOR GLAZER FOR AUTHORIZING THIS IMPORTANT. MEASURE IN THE STAFF FOR THEIR ANALYSIS IN THE WORK ON THE BILL IT IS IMPORTANT MEASURE I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY WONDERFUL JOB SUMMARIZING WHY -- FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATION HAS CONSIDERED INCREASING THE PHARMACIST PHARMACY TECHNICIAN RATIO -- THE CHALLENGE OF SUCH AN EXPANSION IS TO INSURE PHARMACIST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AS WELL AS THE PATIENT'S HEALTH. ARE ALL OPTIMIZED AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS STRIKES THE CORRECT BALANCE ON FIRST YEAR OF CW REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF FORMS. A FOR SEVERAL YEARS OUR PHARMACIST MEMBERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT WORKLOAD AND THE INABILITY TO PROPERLY OVERSEE THE DISPENSING AND HANDLING PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS. ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER DUTIES. AS A RESULT YOUR CW A SPONSORED SB FOURTEEN FORTY TWO BY SENATOR WIENER AND THE NO PHARMACIST LEFT BEHIND BILL. INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPROACH SB SIX SEVENTEEN PUSHERS PHARMACIST OUR COMPANY READ BY TRAINED IN FULLY LICENSED PHARMACY TECHS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED OF PHARMACY TECHS UNDERGO EXTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL AND JOB TRAINING AND THEY MUST BE CERTIFIED TO WORK ON OUR PHARMACIES. AND THERE ARE ALWAYS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED PHARMACIST. ANA THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO SUPPLANT PHARMACIST. INSTEAD SEEKS TO ASSIST PHARMACIST IN LINE WITH MOST OTHER STATES IN THE UNION. SECOND I SUSPECT THE OPPOSITION WILL RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES REGARDING PATIENT SAFETY. AND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS A PHARMACIST. LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR EITHER PHARMACIST OR PHARMACY TECHS. IN ADDITION THE PHARMACY BOARD COMPOSED UP PHARMACIST IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE ALL RATIO INCREASES. THEREBY PROTECTING PHARMACIST AND PATIENTS ALIKE MOVE FINALLY UFCW REPRESENTS BOTH PHARMACIST AND PHARMACY TECHS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. AND FOR ALL PATIENTS. ON IN CONSISTENT WITH OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES IN OUR CORE MISSION. SB SIX ONE SEVEN WILL CREATE. GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS IN AS YOU ALL KNOW PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THERE IS A GREAT SHORTAGE OF GOOD PAYING SUSTAINABLE JOBS. AN AYE VOTE. FOUR SIX ONE SEVEN IS VOTE FOR GOOD JOBS. JOBS WITH BENEFITS LIVABLE WAGES RETIREMENT BENEFITS. GOOD DROPS HONEST SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. NO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARK JOHNSTON AND I'VE BEEN A CALIFORNIA LICENSE PHARMACIST FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. AND FORMALLY I'VE SERVED AS AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. I AM CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AS A SENIOR DIRECTOR WAS CVS HEALTH I LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF SB. SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF LIMITING RATIOS REQUIRE PHARMACIST TO ENGAGE IN NON JUDGMENTAL TASKS AS OPPOSED TO PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA FACES A PROVIDER SHORTAGE. PHARMACISTS SPEND AN AVERAGE OF PHARMACY TECHNICIAN LEVEL TASKS. AS THE PHARMACIST A TECHNICIAN RATIO INCREASES FORM SUSPEND LAST TIME PRFORMING TECHNICIAN DUTIES IN MORE TIME COMPLETING PHARMACIST ONLY DUTIES. LIMITED RATIOS LIMIT OUR PHARMACISTS FROM PERFORMING THE FULL ARRAY OF PHARMACISTS COGNITIVE SERVICES THAT WOULD INCREASE PATIENT SAFETY. YOU'VE ENACTED LAWS THAT ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO PERFORM SUCH DUTIES AS HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION TRAVEL MEDICATION IN THE LOCKS OWN FURNISHING. ADMINISTERING ADMINISTRATIONS IN ADVANCE KAGHAN OF SERVICES SUCH AS MTM THERAPY ENHANCE COUNSELING WHEN DISPENSING OPIOIDS AND ENTERING INTO A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENTS WITH PHYSICIANS. BUT PHARMACIST NEED MORE TECHNICIAN HELP TO MAXIMIZE THEIR TIME SPENT ON THESE ACTIVITIES. SB SIX SEVENTEEN ALLOWS FOR PHARMACISTS TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF THE EXPANDED SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF THIS BODY ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN ENABLING PHARMACIST A PRACTICE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LICENSE. AND FOCUS ON DIRECT PATIENT CARE. THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE REVEALS AN OVERWHELMINGLY. THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE REVEALS% AN OVERWHELMING SAFETY. TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS IN SHIFT TOWARDS AN INCREASING. IN SHIFT TOWARDS INCREASING IN REMOVING TECHNICIAN OR PHARMACIST RATIOS -- FEATURING TWENTY ONE STATES THAT HAVE ELIMINATED ARE NEVER SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A RATIO WITH-WASHINGTON EXPECTED TO BE THE TWENTY SECOND STATE AFTER RULE HEARING THIS FRIDAY. I ANSWER STATES WITH OVER A CENTURY OF SUCCESS -- IN ALLOWING PHARMACIST TO DETERMINE AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION OVER SUPPORT PERSONNEL THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY REMOVED ALL RACIAL RESTRICTIONS FROM THE MODEL STATE. PHARMACY PRACTICE ACTIN RULES IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE SO FAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SIX BOARDS OF PHARMACY OF VOTED TO INCREASE OR OF ENACTED INCREASES AND RATIOS RANGING FROM. FOUR TO ONE TO EIGHT TO ONE WHICH WILL EFFECTIVELY LEAVE ONE STATED A TWO TO ONE RATIO AND CALIFORNIA ALONE IS THE ONLY STATE WITH A ONE TO ONE RATIO. I WILL ALSO NOTE THE NOTE STATE IS EVER VOTED TO DECREASE THE PHARMACY TECHNICIAN RATIO. I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN WE RAISED OUR PHARMACIST A TECHNICIAN RATIO FROM. THREE TO ONE TO SIX TO ONE THE BOARD DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FORMAL COMPLAINTS FROM PHARMACISTS TECHNICIANS OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. REGARDING THE INCREASED RATIO. UPON THE CHANGES SIX TO ONE I SENT INSPECTORS TO OBSERVE ACTUAL COMMUNITY PHARMACY RATIO INCREASES AND WE RARELY SAW RATIO ABOVE FOUR TO ONE UTILIZED -- THIS IS A REMINDER TO THIS BODY THAT WE ARE AN ACTING. NOW WHAT WE ARE IN ACTING WITH SB SIX SEVENTEEN IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. WHAT WE DID SEE WAS AN INCREASE IN EXPANDED PHARMACIST SERVICES OFFERED A LAST YEAR THE STATE REMOVE THE RATIO SO THE PHARMACIST COULD CONCENTRATE ON THE FULL ARRAY OF PATIENTS SERVICES? THIS DECISION. WAS INFLUENCED BY PHIL BURGESS LONGSTANDING PRESIDENT OF THE ILLINOIS BOARD OF PHARMACY WHO STATED. THE ILLINOIS BOARD STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THE CURRENT ILLINOIS PHARMACY REGULATIONS WHICH DO NOT HAVE A TECHNICIAN RATIO RESTRICTION. ARE APPROPRIATE AND THAT THEY ARE IN NO WAY JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE CITIZENS OF ILLINOIS. ON BEHALF OF CVS HEALTH WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SINCE CALIFORNIA INCREASE THE PHARMACIST A TECHNICIAN RATIO. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS SB SIX SEVENTEEN AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GET YOUR CHANCE RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID. GET TO SEE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. UP FOR SITE MONEY DEVIATE A LITTLE FROM MY PREPARED REMARKS IT'S GREAT TO SEE A FAMILIAR FACE IN THE VICE CHAIR. ARE TWO CD SHARE THE SAME SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DUNBAR MOMENT. AND I'M SURE IN ADDITION TO SHARING A SCHOOL DISTRICT WE SURE THING WITHOUT -- MY NAME IS LARGELY I AM PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED SPARTACIST ASSOCIATE YOUR HEAD PHARMACIST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MORE IMPORTANTLY. I'D BEEN A PRACTICING PHARMACIST FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. I'M HERE TO OPPOSE SB SIX SEVENTEEN BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED THAT PATIENT SAFETY IS AT RISK. WELL THERE ARE FEW STUDIES ON THE DISCUSSION OF RATIOS AND STATES HAVE DIFFERENT RATIOS. I DO KNOW ONE THING. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN PATIENT AND WORKER PROTECTIONS. SB SIX SEVENTEEN IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THOSE CALIFORNIA VALES. PHARMACISTS ARE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO DETECTING AND PREVENTING MEDICATION ERRORS. AN AREA WHERE STUDIES DO EXIST. IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE DIE AS A RESULT OF A MEDICATION ERROR. IN AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED JUST THIS YEAR AND CITED ON THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH WEBSITE APPROPRIATELY ENTITLED. MEDICATION ERRORS AUTHORS SURE BACK IN TERRICK NOTED THAT A DISTRACTION ANY DISTRACTION ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY 75% OF ALL MEDICATION ERRORS. ONE OF THEIR SINGULAR RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO APPROACH EVERY PRESCRIPTION WITH CAUTION. WITH THE CHANGE THE PHARMACIST TO PHARMACY TECHNICIAN ISSUE. FARMS IS WILL BE FACED WITH INCREASED DISTRACTIONS BY SUPERVISING MORE AND MORE TECHNICIANS. INSTEAD OF CONSULTING WITH PATIENTS AND FOLKSY FOCUSING SINGULARLY ON PREVENTING MEDICATION ERRORS. MANY OF US HAVE WORKED IN CVS AND OTHER RETAIL STORES. WE HAVE ALWAYS FACE MANY CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY AROUND STUFFING. PHARMACIES ARE HIGH PACE HIGHLY STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENTS. AND WHILE OF FOREIGN TECH AND CLERKS. CAN BE HELPFUL TO ASSIST. NOTHING REPLACES THE SKILLS AND JUDGEMENT OF ANOTHER PHARMACIST. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN DISCUSSION REGARDING THE RACIAL PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IN MEETINGS. THAT IS CHEAPER TO HIRE PHARMACY TECHS INSTEAD OF THE PHARMACISTS CURRENT LAW. WITH RESPECT. ALLOWS PHARMACIES TO ACCESS THREE TECHNICIANS THAT IS WITH TO FARMS DOES NOT SOLELY A ONE TO ONE RATIO. BUT THE CVS IS OF THE WORLD WOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. THERE IS NO. NO HIGHER PRICE TO PAY FOR PATIENT SAFETY. YOUR SAFETY THE CITY OF YOUR PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND CHILDREN. THAT'S WHY SB SIX SEVENTEEN WILL ULTIMATELY HURT OUR FAMILIES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS -- PAT WHALEN HERE ON BEHALF OF UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA UNION HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS -- I JUST WANT TO FOCUS ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION ASPECTS OF THIS BILL -- THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COMPONENT BUT HERE'S HOW THAT WORKS IT ALLOWS THE PHARMACY TO ENTER INTO A CBA WITH SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE PHARMACY TECHNICIANS. ABOUT CHANGING DRAMATICALLY THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE PHARMACISTS. WITHOUT ANY CONSULTATION OR INPUT FROM THE PHARMACISTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CPA WITH THE PHARMACISTS AT ALL. AND THAT'S THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT IN THE AREA OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- BECAUSE YOU INTERJECT A DYNAMIC WHERE THE PHARMACY EMPLOYER. IS ENTERING INTO A CPA WITH A THIRD PARTY -- IN WHICH THE PRINCIPALLY AFFECTED FOLKS IN THIS CASE THE PHARMACISTS HAVE NO INPUT -- AND IT'S IF THAT WAS ALL IT DID. THAT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH -- BUT IN OUR VIEW IT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING A A PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE AS A MISTER LILLY JUST EXPLAIN AND PUTTING IT INTO THE VAGARIES OF THE COLLECTIVE. BARGAINING -- SITUATION WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM THE PHARMACIST WHO IS THE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL WHOSE LICENSES ON THE LINE AND WHO IS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. FOR PATIENT SAFETY SO FOR THAT REASON WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. AND OTHER WITNESSES IN OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WON'T BELABOR THE POINT -- JUST HERE IN SUPPORT OF OUR A DEDICATED PHARMACIST. AT THE UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA -- ND IS STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHEN IS FOR DISEASE AMASS STUFF RAP AT UNIKOM ALSO AVERAGED PHARMACISTS AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL? THANK YOU ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SUCH AN ANTI MONEY ANTENNA CLINICAL-PHARMACIST HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. I VOICE MY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- IT'S NOT GOOD FOR PATIENTS AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LEAD THE WAY IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON TRêN SMITH ON BEHALF OF RITE AID PHARMACIES A UNIONIZE PHARMACY IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE OPPOSED. PETER CALLOUS IN ON BEHALF OF WALGREENS WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT -- WE UNFORTUNATELY MUST ALSO OPPOSE BASED UPON THE LIMITED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COMPONENT OF THE RATIO CHANGE. I'M CHAIR MEMBERS TOWARDS NORM APPLE WALMART AGAIN JUST LIKE PETER SAID. AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT I AGREE WITH THE THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO SHOW THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SOMEHOW MAKES THIS BILL SAY. FOR US RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. MANAGER MEMBERS I'M DIRECT MARIO BEHALF ALBERTSON'S SAFEWAY A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER APOLOGIZES AND MEETING WITH ANOTHER MEMBER BY THE STARTED. WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND SUPPORT SENATOR GLAZER IN THIS BILL. AND JUST WANTED TO REGISTER OUR SUPPORT DIDN'T GET A LETTER AND ON TIME BUT WE WILL BE FORTHCOMING THANK YOU THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WHY DO I'M I'M GONNA SHARE MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF DECADES AGO I I WORKED IN A PHARMACY BEFORE? AND I HAVE WITNESSED -- YOU KNOW THE WORK OF PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACY TECHNICIANS AND I TELL YOU I ALSO HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE PHARMACISTS AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS COMPLAIN TO ME. THAT MOST OF THEIR TIME IS SPENT ON COUNTING PILLS DISPENSING AND NOT REALLY. ON WHAT THEY'RE TRAINED FOR WHICH IS TO PROVIDE PATIENT CARE AND I'VE HEARD THAT TIME AND% TIME AGAIN. AND I I WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. THIS BILL IN THE FUTURE OR A SUBSEQUENT BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND IT TO PHARMACIES THAT ARE NOT COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE AS WELL SO. WITH THAT -- DO WE HAVE MOTION. A SENATOR ARCHULETA. WE HAVE MOSTLY FROM CENTER ARCHULETA SECRETARY WILL CALL THEM I'M SORRY I'M SO SORRY. MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOSE YEAH THANK YOU OFFER THAT TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR THIS BILL. THERE'S A REASON THAT CALIFORNIA REMAINS LAST ON THIS RATIO ISSUE -- LOGIC WOULD SAY COMBINED -- THE OTHER STATES DIDN'T -- RAISE IT TO IN DANGER PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY. NOW. HI IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE THESE HIGHLY TRAINED PHARMACISTS AND USE THEIR TIME APPROPRIATELY SO IT DOES THE PAST. FOR PATIENTS. I CERTAINLY DOES THE BEST TO LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS WHEN APPROPRIATE BUT NOTHING'S MORE IMPORTANT PATIENT PATIENT SAFETY. BUT THINK ABOUT IT YOU'RE YOU'RE A HIGHLY TRAINED PHARMACISTS. AND YOUR SPIRIT SPENDING YOUR WHOLE DAY DOING WHAT. TALKING TO DOCTORS OFFICES TO TRY TO GET THROUGH SITTING ON HOLD. COUNTING PILLS SHEET WHICH CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT BUT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHLY TRAINED TO DO THAT TOO WITH THAT WITH THE DIFFERENT EDUCATION -- THAT -- CAN DO THAT PERFECTLY APPROPRIATELY AND AND KEEP THIS IN MIND ALL THIS IS DONE UNDER THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. ALL MADE UP OF PHARMACISTS OKAY WHO ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE THE PATIENT SAFETY AND ALL THAT THEY DO AND IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE OF THE BILL IT. IT GOES TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THESE TECHNICIANS HAVE TO FOLLOW THERE'S NINE OF THEM GOES TO EVERYONE OF THE TRAINING. AND SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS OF THESE TECHNICIANS IT'S EXHAUSTED -- AND AND IT'S APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE IT IS IT IS ABOUT A PATIENT SAFETY. BUT THERE'S A REASON THAT I SAID AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING HERE THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT ALL ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE. AND THIS TRIES TO FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND SO WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS THERE'S MORE. TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA I'M I'M COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND IF WE CAN'T AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES FORWARD. BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT STEP AHEAD. AND DIED SO FOR THOSE WHO SAY I WISH SHE WOULD DO THIS I WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT. NOT ALL THAT I WANT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO PROGRESS. AND THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO FIND THAT THAT THAT THAT PATHWAY FOR YOU WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HIGH. I JUST OF ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION WE BE TAKING THE A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT YES YES MA'AM. WITH THAT US SECRETARY WILL CALL THE ROLL.
