00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:08.665
SECURITIES LAW SO WE CARVE OUT.

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.167

FROM SECURITIES LAW THEN WE

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:13.437

PRIMARY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AND

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.745
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT IS

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.180
HOW WE TEST WITHOUT GETTING

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:24.381
INTO THE LEGAL TECHNICALITIES.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.416

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.522
HELD A GOOD LAW FOR SO LONG

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:34.057

SAFETY CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.798

HELLO. IN SPACE THANK. IN ANY

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:54.778
OTHER TYPE TECHNO. IS BECAUSE

MANY DIFFERENT TERMS. THAT ALSO

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:02.833

TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.842
CONTINUE. TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.243
AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.847
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE INJURED BY

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:17.414

THANK YOU THAT MAKES ACTUALLY A

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.658
LITTLE MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.527
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH THE

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:33.497
LACK OF CLARITY HERE. IS THAT

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:36.366
ABSENCE APPROPRIATE DEFINITIONS

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.234
FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.869
WITH THE DIGITAL ASSET

00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:39.803
REGULATORS ARE FALLING TO THE

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.104
SECURITIES LAWS BECAUSE THAT'S

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:43.607
KIND OF ALL THEY HAVE AND I

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.675
THINK WHAT THIS SPACE IS

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:48.345
LOOKING FOR IT IS CLEAR

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.646
DEFINITION OUT WHAT IS SECURITY

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.181
IS OR ISN'T AND IF WE'RE NOT.

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:54.151
TO FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.386
AND PROSECUTING FRY IN THIS

00:50:56.453 --> 00:51:00.090
CATEGORY. THERE JEFF I WE'RE

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:00.957
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY JUST

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:04.428
EXEMPTING THEM FROM A TOOL THAT

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.763
THAT THEY ARE USING. THESE ARE

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.233
MORE LIKE. OTHER CURRENCIES IN

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.301
PEOPLE INVESTING CURRENCIES ALL

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.069
THE TIME THEY ARE USES IT

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.771
INVESTMENT PRIMARILY YES THEY

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.239
USE FOR IT FOR EXCHANGE OF

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:17.808
GOODS OR GOODS AND SERVICES BUT

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:20.477
MOSTLY THEY'RE IN INVESTMENT

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.312
AND THEIR TRADED THAT MOST

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.514
PEOPLE WHO ACQUIRE THESE ARE

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.615
OUR TRADING THEM FAIRLY

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:28.652
ACTIVELY TRYING TO MAKE EVEN

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.053
MORE MONEY. ON THEM AND- FOR

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.021
SOMEONE WHO SOPHISTICATED OR

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:32.289
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:33.457
RISKS YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.859
REALLY NOT AN ISSUE. BUT WE DO

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:38.195
HAVE IT THERE'S LESS OF A

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:39.429
SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.231
TRYING TO SELL WHAT WE THINK OF

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.667
AS A TRADITIONAL SECURITY. BE

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:45.802
BECAUSE THAT IS. THAT IS AN

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.637
INVESTMENT IN AN ORGANIZATION

00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:48.839
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE VERY

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:50.173
WELL MANAGED THERE MAY NOT

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.242
SURVIVE IN A COULD BE SO BE

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:54.010
SOLD A BILL OF GOODS AND REALLY

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.346
LOSE A LOT OF GROUND. SO THE

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:58.615
CLEAR DIFFERENCE HERE BETWEEN A

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.417
SECURITY AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.852
ABOUT HERE WITH THE JULY SINCE

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:03.320
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:06.122
NOT SURE. TYING THINGS TO THE

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.425
HOW WE TEST BECAUSE YES IT'S

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:09.726
BEEN LONG STANDING WITH RESPECT

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.061
TO SECURITIES BUT REALLY

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:11.995
TALKING ABOUT. A BIT OF A

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:13.730
DIFFERENT ANIMAL. I'D BE A LOT

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.366
HAPPIER IF WE WERE HANDING TVO

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.235
THE AUTHORITY TO FIGURE OUT

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.769
WHAT IT REGULATORY SCHEME WOULD

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:22.038
BE AND- I THINK IF WE JUST FALL

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:24.474
BACK- YOU KNOW IN ALL DUE

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.041
RESPECT MISTER CALDERON BUT

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.376
YOUR STATEMENT THAT IF WE OVER

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:27.978
DEFINITE. DEFINITIONAL ICE

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:31.348
THINGS. WE CREATE. A MASS. I'VE

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.949
COMPLETELY THE OTHER WAY AROUND

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.918
IT'S THOSE DEFINITIONS THAT

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.686
PROVIDE THE CLARITY OF ME LIKE

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.488
YOU'RE- YOU'VE THROWN. YOUR

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.257
SPONSORS OF THROWN SOME SOME

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:40.991
WORDS IN HERE THAT THEY MAY

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.225
UNDERSTAND WITH LEGAL SYSTEM

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:44.127
DOESN'T. FULLY OPERATIONAL

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.762
NETWORK I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.063
THAT MEANS. AND I DON'T THINK

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.233
ANYBODY DOES REALLY EITHER AND

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.768
IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT IT'S A

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:52.335
NETWORK YOU'D BE BETTER OFF

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.604
DEFINING WHAT A DIGITAL ASSET

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.172
IN THIS CASE IT. DIGITAL

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:57.707
CURRENCY BECAUSE THAT THE

00:52:57.774 --> 00:53:01.411
NARROW. SET OF. PRODUCT REALLY

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:02.479
THAT WE'RE- ABOUT HERE THERE

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.915
ARE. OTHER DIGITAL ASSETS HERE

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:07.384
THAT COULD GET SWEPT UP AS

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:07.918
WE'RE TRYING TO EXEMPT THE

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:10.520
JEWEL CURRENCIES. FROM THAT

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:13.957
FROM BEING CATEGORIZED AS A

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.726
SECURITY SO. THAT'S REALLY ONE

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:18.628
OF MY WORRIES HERE IS THAT

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:21.298
INSTEAD OF PROVIDING CLARITY

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.866
WE'RE PROVIDING CLARITY BY JUST

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.000
SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.603
SET OF RULES. WELL HAT'S NOT A

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.639
REPLACEMENT FOR PROTECTIONS FOR

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:32.042
CONSUMERS SHOULD SOMETHING GO

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:33.410
WRONG AND SHOULD THEY BE TALKED

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:35.078
INTO ACQUIRING. THESE

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.980
CURRENCIES AND THEN THE BOTTOM

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:39.416
FALLS OFF THESE ARE VERY VERY

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.518
VOLATILE CURRENCIES THEY GO UP

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.886
AND DOWN ALL TIME YOU CAN

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.955
WATCH. THE LITTLE SUB MARKETS

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:46.823
THAT THEY HAVE THESE THINGS.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.426
THAT IN THE THEY FLUCTUATE

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:51.962
REALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT-

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:52.963
MY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HE IS

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.731
THOUGH AND I DON'T THINK YOU

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.900
WOULD SIT IN YOUR OPENING

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.069
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT.

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.637
THEATER ENTRY REBUTTABLE FOR

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.505
SOME. AND THE RECORD CAN BY

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:05.775
COMMITTEE WHICH I GREATLY OKAY.

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:07.010
MAKE THAT STAND ACTUALLY WILL

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:07.978
CLEAR AND SEE EVIDENCE IN THE

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:09.746
CASE IS. WORKABLE ARE YOU

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.281
TAKING THAT AS AN AMENDMENT SO

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:12.349
YEAH SO WHAT WORKING WITH THE

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.783
COMMITTEE THEY PROVIDED A

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.485
PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE WITH-

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:16.953
WITH A LITTLE BIT BEYOND THAT

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.722
WE PRESENTED THAT TO THE TV

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:19.689
OUT. AND SO WE'RE GONNA

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.558
SUGGESTION BACK FROM THE V. L.

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.326
BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT IT IS RIGHT

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.961
NOW WILL NOT. CHANGE WERE

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:27.764
WAITING FOR OUR FEEDBACK BACK

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.132
IN THE BE ON A SPECIFIC THESE.

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.967
OKAY BECAUSE IF THIS IF THIS

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.602
SEVEN ENTRY STANDARD STAYS I

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.671
CAN'T SUPPORT IT WILL NOT THAT.

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.307
IT IS GOING TO CHECK OKAY I'M

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:38.274
GONNA SUPPORT IS THAT AT THIS

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.477
POINT. BUT I THINK YOU'RE ON

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.579
THE WRONG TRACK WITH THIS BY

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.547
JUST CREATING A BROAD EXEMPTION

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.182
AND ESPECIALLY WITHOUT.

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:47.984
ACTUALLY DEFINING WHAT WE ARE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.853
TALKING ABOUT YOUR DEFINING

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:51.855
CONTACTED BEHAVIORS RATHER

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:55.225
THAN. ASSET ITSELF. AND THAT'S

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:56.326
WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD GO IF

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.327
THIS IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.029
SUCCESSFUL IN FOR BOTH PROTECT

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:02.699
CONSUMERS. AND PROVIDE CLARITY

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.634
FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT'S

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.935
DEVELOPING AROUND DIGITAL

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:08.672
CURRENCIES AND HOW BY I THINK

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:09.406
THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER WAY

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.374

TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THAT

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:23.953
INTERACTS WITH THE RULE OF LAW

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.221
AND SO I THINK THAT'S IN THE

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:26.322
RIGHT DIRECTION I DO WANT TO

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:28.091

WAGES WERE STOLEN. THAT'S

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.189
BECAUSE THESE BUSINESSES

WAGED AGAINST THEM THIS WILL

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:24.099
INSURE ON THAT THESE COMPANIES

PART OF THE CONVERSATION- I

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:06.252
THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IN

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.454
FRONT OF YOU IS A BILL THAT. IS

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:11.257
BIG ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND-

02:02:11.323 --> 02:02:12.525
IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.226
HAD WITH OPPOSITION CERTAINLY

02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:16.128
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:17.797
SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT HOW. THAT

02:02:17.863 --> 02:02:18.698
GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED THERE'S

02:02:18.764 --> 02:02:20.533
FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT ARE

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:21.400
INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:23.836
BILL AND SO EVERY SECTOR HAS A

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:25.071
DIFFERENT PRINTER XIN I HAVE

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:27.707
BOTH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. OKAY

02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:30.776
ARE A REALLY GOOD SITE EIGHT.

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:31.944
MY NEXT QUESTION A QUESTIONS

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:33.779
FOR. WITH A OF COMMENTARY. I

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:35.848
EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT CREDIT

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:37.950
UNIONS. SO BASED ON MY

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:39.852
CONVERSATIONS WITH CREDIT

ACTION. RED THEIR CAPITAL WAS

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.922
REDUCED TO A POINT I PERCENT SO

02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:18.090
THEY WOULD SEE SO MEDIA

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:19.959
STOPPING IN MORE A AND LINDA

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:45.885
DEALING WITH A FEW ISSUES

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:47.653

UNEMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY LENDERS

LENDING CREDIT ARE LIMITED TO

HOW THEY GENERATE REVENUE WHICH

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:01.133
COMES FROM RETAINED EARNINGS

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.269
WHICH PRIMARILY FOR MAKING

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:06.238
LOANS SO WITH THAT BEING SAID

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:11.177
WHAT CONCERT PATIENT HAS BEEN

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:15.447
GIVEN TO THE IMPACT ON CREDIT.

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:18.250

CEASE TO LAY AND FOR ALL AND

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:23.422
HOW WHERE WILL CONSTITUENTS

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.157
THEN GO TO FOR FINANCIAL HELP

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:27.426
SET THREE POINTS FIRST AND THIS

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:28.828
IS WHAT WILL COME FROM THE

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:30.496
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT CLEAR

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:31.997
WE KNOW WHAT'S COMPASS FAR SO

02:04:32.064 --> 02:04:33.666
WE CAN'T SPECULATE ON THAT I

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:35.301
THINK ALL TAKING IT WEEK BY

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:39.305
WEEK I'M AT THE SECOND POINT IS.

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:40.239
THE NUMBERS SPECULATE THAT

02:04:40.306 --> 02:04:42.174
YOU'VE GIVEN IS CONSIDERING THE

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:43.275
BILL AS IS WITHOUT

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:45.110
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IN THE

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:46.412
ANALYSIS AND SOME AMENDMENT

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:48.280
AREAS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON.

02:04:48.347 --> 02:04:49.782
SO I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:52.318
UNFAIR TO ASSESS IT- KNOWING

02:04:52.384 --> 02:04:53.519
THAT THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:54.653
THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.755
AMENDMENTS- AND THEN I FORGOT

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:58.490
THE THIRD POINT. SO SORRY THERE

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:01.994
WAS. ONE LAST QUESTION IF I MAY

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:04.230
AND ANOTHER COMMENDABLE

02:05:04.296 --> 02:05:06.632
PROVISION OF THE BILL IS THE

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:07.833
ONE TO ENSURE SOME RENTERS

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:10.436
RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FOR POWER OF

02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:12.972
WHO RECEIVED MORTGAGE

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:15.374
FORBEARANCE HAVING WORKED ON

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:16.675
THE ANTI RENT GOUGING AND JUST

02:05:16.742 --> 02:05:18.210
BECAUSE THE VICTIM POLICIES

02:05:18.277 --> 02:05:20.679
LAST YEAR I AM ACUTELY AWARE OF

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:23.015
THE COMPLEXITY OF RENT AND-

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:25.084
SHOES. SO HAVE HAS THERE BEEN

02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:26.752
CONSIDER XIN TO HOW THE RITUAL

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:28.587
PROVISIONS WILL INTERACT WITH

02:05:28.654 --> 02:05:30.322

CONTROL ORDINANCES YES AND THE

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:41.567
REASON THAT YOU DON'T SEE WHAT

RICK RENTS RELIEF IS DEFINED IT

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:46.071

STRUGGLING FOR THE- FUTURE WE

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:42.628
CRITICAL THAT WE PROVIDE

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:43.896
PROTECTIONS TO THEM FOR THAT

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:44.663

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:07.419
SO THAT THE PEACE OF THE BILL I

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:10.322
AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IT THE

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:16.662
AND. FOR THE FOR. IT'S WRITTEN

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:19.198
THAT TO CAN LEAD TO A FOR ONE

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.666
THAT THE FIRE EITHER RIGHT. OR

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:22.201
OR TELLS THE LENDER THAT

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:23.102
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:24.436
AND THEY PROVIDE NO ADDITIONAL

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:26.305
DOCUMENTATION THE OTHER IS THAT

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:27.606
THEY GO SIXTY DAYS WITHOUT

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.341
PAYING AND THEN THEY GET

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:33.278
FORBEARANCE. BOTH OF THOSE SEEM.

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:34.146
NOT LIKE THE STRONGEST

02:07:34.213 --> 02:07:35.647
PROTECTION IF YOU WILL FOR THE

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:36.982
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:39.551
FOR PARENTS TO THE CALIFORNIANS

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:41.487
THAT NEED IT WHICH I THINK IS

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:42.921
THE BALANCE THAT I WOULD LIKE

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.056
TO SEE IN THIS BILL IS MAKING

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:45.591
SURE THAT THOSE THAT NEED IT.

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:46.558
GET THE FORBEARANCE AND THOSE

02:07:46.625 --> 02:07:48.060
THEY CAN PAY CONTINUE TO PAY

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:48.827
AND ALLOW THE FINANCIAL

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:50.462
INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE THE CASH

02:07:50.529 --> 02:07:51.697
FLOW TO SUPPORT ALL OF THEIR

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:53.032
BORROWERS. SO I GUESS I WOULD

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:53.866
ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO THOSE

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:54.833
PROVISIONS AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:56.668
THINKING IF THERE IS MOVEMENT

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:58.404
THERE SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:59.605
BALANCE AND WE ACTUALLY KNOW

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:00.472
WE'RE PROTECTING THE

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:01.607

THANK YOU AND SO CURRENTLY WHAT

02:08:02.941 --> 02:08:03.976
HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT THIS

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:05.844
IS IMPORTANT AS YOU HAVE- A LOT

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:08.614
OF DIFFERENT TO A PROCESS SEES

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.516
AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:12.885
SOME PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:15.254

02:08:24.797 --> 02:08:26.965
HOLDER. WHEN IT IS THAT WE CAN

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:34.773
WE THIS. I CAME IN TATIAN. AND

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.308
THAT IS REALLY HARD TO REACH.

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:37.910
SO I'VE GIVEN THE EXAMPLE FOR

02:08:37.976 --> 02:08:41.080
EXACT. ABOUT EDT- WE AT LEAST

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.581
MY DISTRICT MAYBE NOT OTHERS

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:44.950
CHALLENGES WITH THE- BIG

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:46.351
WORKLOAD OF EDT SO GETTING

PROPER DOCUMENTATION FROM ET DE

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:49.388
IS VERY DIFFICULT SO YOU PUT A

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:51.023
CONSUMER IN A PLACE. WHERE SOME

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:52.558
OF THIS DOCUMENTATION THAT SOME

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:53.859
FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR THAT

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.027

HOLDERS ARE ASKING FOR IS VERY

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:57.830
DIFFICULT. AND SO THE REASON WE

02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:59.231
STARTED THERE IS REALLY JUST AS

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.999
A STARTING POINT. I'M A FEW

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.067
HOURS AGO I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.035
I'M FROM A FINANCIAL

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:04.403
INSTITUTION ABOUT A DIFFERENT

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:05.204
WAY THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:07.439
BE DONE. WHICH IS A BALANCE-

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:09.041
BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S A ONE OF

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:10.109
WITH MULTIPLE FINANCIAL

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:13.612
INSTITUTIONS WHEN WE THINK OF

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.080
MORTGAGE HOLDERS. IT'S NOT

02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:15.714
JUST. YOU HAVE. GOOD HOLDERS. I

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:17.616
THINK IT. THIS IS THE STARTING

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:20.152
POINT OF THE CONVERSATION. AND

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:22.488
WHAT I WANT TO ENSURE. IS THERE

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:24.223
IS SOME STANDARDIZATION FOR

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:26.992
CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT NOW. BY

02:09:27.059 --> 02:09:29.094
LUCK IF YOU GET THE RIGHT

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.363
PERSON. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER OR

02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:33.999
NOT THEY'RE ABLE TO. USE THE

02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:36.168
PROTECTIONS OR- CAN YOU NEED TO

02:09:36.235 --> 02:09:39.271
GET. WE HAVE WORKED WITH. IN

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:40.205
THE STATE IN THE LAST EIGHT

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:41.440
WEEKS WE HAVE EITHER GONE THREE

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.275
D. O. COME TO. THEY PAY TO

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:44.109
OTHER MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:45.144
MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE HAVE SENT

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:46.845
THEM OVER TO BANKING. WHO SAID

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.313
WAIT I SHOULD QUALIFY BUT SOME

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.548
OF THIS THAT THEY'RE ASKING

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:52.317
FOR. IS NOT DOABLE SO WHAT

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:53.952
HAPPENS IS THAT LUCKILY YOU

02:09:54.019 --> 02:09:54.887
KNOW IN THE BANKING AND

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.622
FINANCE. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:58.090
WERE ABLE TO MAKE A CALL I KNOW

02:09:58.157 --> 02:09:59.491
WHO THE PLAYERS ARE BUT WE- DO

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:01.160
IT FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA.

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:02.361
AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS

02:10:02.427 --> 02:10:04.229
BILL TO STANDARDIZE IT SO

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:07.199
CERTAINLY NO DOCUMENTATION- AND

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.634
THE SIX MONTH NON PAYMENT IS

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.002
READY FLOATING OUT THERE IT'S

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.637
NOT STUFF THAT WE TOOK FROM NOW

02:10:11.703 --> 02:10:13.672
WHERE IT'S FLOATING. THERE AND

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:16.542
IT'S PART OF THE INCONSISTENT

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:17.142
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:18.243
DO IT BETTER ANY INTEREST IF

02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:19.178
YOU ARE. AGO I HEARD A GREAT

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:21.613
FROM ONE OF MULTIPLE. AND

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.315
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ABOUT A

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:24.516
WAY THAT COULD COVER BOTH-

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:25.784
SOMETHING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:27.186
IT LOOKED LIKE AN AFFIDAVIT.

02:10:27.252 --> 02:10:30.489
RIGHT AND WITH THAT MEET THE

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:31.356
FEDERAL YOU KNOW OBLIGATE TORY.

02:10:31.423 --> 02:10:33.692
PROOF BUT ALSO WITH THAT THEN

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:34.660
YOU KNOW SOMEONE SIGNED THE

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:36.695
AFFIDAVIT YOU TO SAY. YES I

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:38.030
CERTIFY AND I AGREE THAT I

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.798
LEGITIMATELY HAVE. A CODE NAME

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:41.633
TO RESPONSE OKAY. IT'S ALL PART

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:44.303
OF NEGOTIATION. AND THIS BILL

02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:46.305
WAS INTENTIONAL AND STARTING

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:47.773
WITH SOME OF STRONGEST TUMOR

02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:49.608
PROTECTIONS. AND NOT PUTTING

02:10:49.675 --> 02:10:51.710
THE PROOF OF BURDEN ON THE

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:54.046
CONSUMER- I AM CONFIDENT THAT

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:56.415
AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. SOME

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:57.749
OF IT WILL CHANGE. IT WILL BE

02:10:57.816 --> 02:11:00.085
WHERE DOES INSTEAD. AND THE-

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:03.589
HOLDERS THAT CHOOSE TO BE AT

02:11:03.655 --> 02:11:04.790
THE TABLE TO. TWO OF. WORKING I

02:11:04.856 --> 02:11:06.391
THINK. I'M JUST EVEN IN SOME OF

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:07.292
THE OP. THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:10.429
HAVE LESS INTEREST- IN YOU KNOW

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:11.997
TRYING TO WORK IT OUT THEY FEEL

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.599
THE WHOLE BILL AS A WHOLE NEEDS

02:11:13.665 --> 02:11:14.299
TO DIE. AND BUT THEN THERE'S

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:16.068
OTHERS WERE REALLY LOOKING AT

02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:18.470
SPACES THAT CAN. BE WORKED ON

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:20.639
AND SO WE ARE AT HAVING THOSE

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:21.707
CONVERSATION AND IF THIS BILL

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:23.775
MOVES FOR TODAY- EIGHT

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:25.544
DEFINITELY AMONG THINGS WE ARE

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:27.512
CONSIDERING. THANK YOU I MEAN.

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:29.748
I SHARE SOME IMMIGRANTS. OTHER

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:30.916
CONCERN ALSO ABOUT OUR LOCAL

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:32.384
CREDIT UNIONS AND THEY'RE

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:33.752
PROVIDING INCREDIBLE FOR

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:35.654
PARENTS TO MANY CUSTOMERS THE

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:36.922
NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN HEAR

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:40.025
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. AND EVEN

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:41.426
WITHIN THAT THEY'VE SEEN PEOPLE

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:43.629
WHO TAKE IT. THIS CITY. IN

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.264
NEEDS THE FOUR FRIENDS BY ARE

02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:46.231
IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. TO THEM

02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.200
AND I AND I. THEIR DESIRE TO

02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:50.435
PROVIDE IT TO THOSE WHO NEED IT

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:53.372
AND NOT TO THOSE WHO DON'T I

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:54.573
THINK WE NEED TO STRIKE THAT

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:57.109
BALANCE. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:11:57.175 --> 02:12:00.512
TODAY. I WE- ARE PLACED.

02:12:00.579 --> 02:12:03.715
SPECIAL AND THIS. BECAUSE I IS

02:12:03.782 --> 02:12:05.751
CRITICAL. OUR INPUT OUR

02:12:05.817 --> 02:12:07.085
FINANCIAL INTRO BASS FISHING

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:08.287
CASH FLOW ABSOLUTELY I THINK

02:12:08.353 --> 02:12:09.221
THAT THE TO BE CLEAR THAT THE

02:12:09.288 --> 02:12:10.455
ISSUE OF IN THE TO AND OF A

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.024
GOVERNMENT RESOURCE IS

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:15.160
EXISTENCE IN EVERY THING THAT

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:16.728
WE DO AS A GOVERNMENT AND I

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:18.730
THINK THAT WE CAN LOOK- AT

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:20.032
OTHER SECTORS WHERE WE'RE

02:12:20.098 --> 02:12:21.533
TRYING TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.335
FOR TRIED PROVIDE GRANTS FRIEND

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:25.570
RIGHT RIGHT THIS IS INSIDE

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:26.705
REALLY DEALER SINCE AS A WHOLE.

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:28.974
RAFFLES WITH REALLY A SMALL FEW

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:30.942
AND YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:32.811
TAKE ADVANTAGE- I THINK THE

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:34.713
TRUTH IS THAT OUR NUMBERS IN

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.214
CALIFORNIA WITH FOUR POINT TWO

02:12:36.281 --> 02:12:37.949
MILLION PEOPLE EILING FOR

02:12:38.016 --> 02:12:39.151
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE-

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:41.486
WOULD BEG TO SAY THAT THE GREAT

02:12:41.553 --> 02:12:42.354
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:47.025

JUST A COMPOUND. AND THAT THAT

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:56.895
WOULD MAKE MY FINANCIAL

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:59.464
SITUATION A LOT WORSE. AND THAT

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.199
THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE OR MAY

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:04.936
HAVE ALL. BUSINESS AND RECOVER

SOME WAYS SO SOME PEOPLE MAY

YET BENEFIT BUT THE MAJORITY TO

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:15.147
MY ESTIMATES THEY MAY NOT HAVE

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.382
THE FINANCIAL SOLUTION FONDA

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:19.584
AFTER SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR SO

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:24.156
THAT'S MINE- QUESTION HOW YOU

02:14:24.222 --> 02:14:25.390
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT. AFTER SIX

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.659
MONTHS A YEAR SECOND QUESTION

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.661
IS A THIS HAS ALL HOME FOR

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:31.963

TO TENANTS A BY RESIDENTIAL

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:41.006
TENANTS. HOWEVER MORE THOUGH

02:14:41.072 --> 02:14:43.708
WHETHER YOU AT YOUR TEN ON SO

02:14:43.775 --> 02:14:46.845
OR SO BUSINESS TOWN TO. ARE THE

02:14:46.912 --> 02:14:49.281
IN A BUSINESS TALENTS- THE RENT

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:51.783
IF I DON'T PAY I HAVE A RIGHT

02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:54.486
TO ASK FOR NOT TO CHARGE ME AND

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:58.089
ATTENDS STADIO FOR ALL YEAR.

02:14:58.156 --> 02:15:01.126
AND THE YOUR LATER I CAN FILE A

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:04.629
BANKRUPTCY. AND THEN THE-

02:15:04.696 --> 02:15:07.232
PROPERTY OWNER OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:10.602
SO FOR A LOT MORE AT THAT TIME

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:13.104
RATHER THAN FACING. THE PROBLEM

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:16.575
SO. AS WE GO BINDING ON MONTH

02:15:16.641 --> 02:15:19.077
TO MONTH IF THE STOCK. SO CAN

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:21.980
YOU DEFINE THAT. WHAT WHAT YOU

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:24.516
MEAN BY TEN OCT SURE SO THE TWO

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.017
THE TWO PARTS I THINK YOU ASKED

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:27.252
ABOUT THE LUMP SUMS WHAT

02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:28.420
HAPPENS IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD

02:15:28.487 --> 02:15:31.590
YOUR RENTS- OR YOUR MORTGAGE

02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:32.958
FOR THREE MONTHS HOW ARE YOU

02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:33.859
GOING TO PAY IT BACK MONTH FOR

02:15:33.925 --> 02:15:34.759
IT ASSUMING THAT THE

02:15:34.826 --> 02:15:36.461
FORBEARANCE THE THREE MONTH AND

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:38.864
SO THAT'S ACT ONE OF THE KERN

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.699
THE CONVERSATION PERHAPS. THE

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:41.500
REAL IMPORT POINT B. THEY'RE

02:15:41.566 --> 02:15:43.502
ALL EXISTING DISTANCE THE

02:15:43.568 --> 02:15:46.037
EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND A

02:15:46.104 --> 02:15:46.571
FEDERALLY BACKED LOAN LIKE

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:49.174
SALLY MAY- OR THE MAC THEY'VE

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:51.276
ALREADY SAID THAT LUMP SUM

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:54.246
PAYMENT WILL NOT BE. I SO YOU

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:55.780
WON'T HAVE TO PAY THE THREE

02:15:55.847 --> 02:15:58.483
MONTHS. OF MORTGAGE YOU PAY ON

02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:59.985
THE FOUR MONTH THEY'RE GOING TO

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:01.386
WORK OUT A PAYMENT PLAN.

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:03.655
HOWEVER YOU HAVE OTHER AYE

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:04.890
LENDERS WHO HAVEN'T SAID THAT

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:06.458
YET AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:08.193
OF THE BIG POINTS OF THIS.

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.628
PARTICULAR BILL THAT IT'S GOING

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:10.295
TO WORK IT OUT FOR

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:12.697
CALIFORNIANS- AND YOU DO HAVE

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.633
EXAMPLES AGAIN A FEDERALLY

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:17.202
BACKED. LENDERS WHO ARE SAYING

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:17.936
THAT THEY'RE GONNA DEAL WITH

02:16:18.003 --> 02:16:19.871
LUMPS- SLUM SOME PAYMENTS IN

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:21.473
THE FORMS OF PAYMENT. AFTER

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.275
RIGHTS A STARTING MONTH FOR

02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:25.143
INSTEAD OF PAIN LET'S JUST SAY

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:25.944
IT WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:28.313
MONTH I MEAN WE KNOW MORTGAGES

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:28.880
IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT THAT.

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:30.081
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY

02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:31.917
ALL THREE THAT AND MONTH FOR

02:16:31.983 --> 02:16:33.285
YOU COULD PUT YOU IN PAYMENTS

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:34.586
AND SO THIS IS PART OF WHAT

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:36.621
THIS. BILL IS DOING IT'S

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:38.223
FORCING A CONVERSATION AROUND

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:40.292
THOSE EXACT ISSUES THAT WE

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.793
ALREADY HAVE EVIDENCE ARE

02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:44.195
INCONSISTENT- HE YOU KNOW NOT

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:45.530
JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:47.566
HERE. IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL-

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:49.501
IT'S REALLY NOW UP TO YOUR BANK

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:50.802
HIT OR MISS ON WHETHER YOU'RE

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.304
GOING TO GET. THE BENEFIT AND

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:53.972
PROTECTION OF A LUMP SUM

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:55.607
PAYMENT. YOUR SECOND QUESTION

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:57.208
WAS ABOUT COMMERCIAL TENANTS.

02:16:57.275 --> 02:16:58.143
AND YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN

02:16:58.209 --> 02:16:59.210
THIS THAT HAS QUESTIONS A

02:16:59.277 --> 02:17:00.845
COMMERCIAL TENANTS BUT THIS

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:02.080
BILL DOES NOT COVER COMMERCIAL

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:04.015
LOANS OR TENANT. ON AND IT

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:06.251
DOES SO. NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.485
THINK THAT THERE'S A

02:17:07.552 --> 02:17:09.020
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD THERE

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:11.923
BUT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS THAT

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:13.992
WITH FOR PROVISIONS IN IT

02:17:14.059 --> 02:17:18.463
THERE'S ALREADY. A HOT. THIS

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:20.966
RENTS THEN CERTAINLY. TENANTS

02:17:21.032 --> 02:17:22.067
IT'S NOT AND COMMERCIAL BUT

02:17:22.133 --> 02:17:24.336
THEY'RE NOT IN THIS BILL- AND

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:26.004
WE DID EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:28.039
WE COULD DO THAT- BUT AGAIN WE

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.674
START TO THE FOUR THINGS THAT

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:31.910
CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA OVER

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:33.178
EIGHT WEEKS HAVE BROUGHT TO US

02:17:33.244 --> 02:17:35.847
THE MOST AND COMMERCIAL IT IT'S

02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:37.382
JUST A DIFFERENT WORKING SPACE

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.084
BUT CERTAINLY MERIT THE

02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:40.619
CONVERSATION AND I WISH I COULD

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:43.188
DO MORE AND I COULD EXPAND ON

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:43.822
THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT CODES IN

02:17:43.888 --> 02:17:49.294
LOS. BUT YOUR TRANSUNION WORKS

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:49.828
THAN A SUMMER GABRIEL YOUR

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.262
PLEASURE. IT THIS IS JUST A

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:52.497
COMMENT I WANTED TO THANK THE

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:54.399
AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL IT'S NOT

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:57.102
AN EASY ONE- BUT YOU WERE NOT

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:58.103
AN EASY TIMES RIGHT NOW AND

02:17:58.169 --> 02:18:00.438
WE'RE LOOKING AT- POTENTIALLY

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:01.172
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:03.041
BEING EVICTED- OF FORECLOSURE

02:18:03.108 --> 02:18:04.776
CRISIS WORSE THAN WE SAW IN TWO

02:18:04.843 --> 02:18:05.610
THOUSAND EIGHT. AND THERE ARE

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:07.245
VERY FEW VEHICLES IN THE

02:18:07.312 --> 02:18:07.779
ASSEMBLY THAT I THINK ARE

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:08.847
REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY TRYING TO

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:11.182
ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND ONE I

02:18:11.249 --> 02:18:11.983
KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED THERE'S A

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.118
LOT OF DIFFERENT. CONCERNS I

02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:15.186
FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY TO THINK

02:18:15.253 --> 02:18:16.321
THROUGH AND I WILL PROBABLY

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:17.255
VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY THANK

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:19.658
YOU. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:21.092
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:23.495
BILL DOESN'T STOP FOR CLOSURES

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:25.997
IT DOESN'T STOP AUTO

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.298
REPOSSESSIONS IT DOESN'T STOP

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:30.101
PERMANENT DAMAGE TO CREDIT IT

02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:33.104
IS SLOWING IT DOWN. ON WE HAVE

02:18:33.171 --> 02:18:35.206
EVIDENCE EXPERIENCE FROM OUR

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:38.777
LAST AND RESULT IN BY TO SEE

02:18:38.843 --> 02:18:40.311
WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:42.180
THE REASON IT'S EVEN FROM HER

02:18:42.247 --> 02:18:44.516
IN IS WE HAVE SO MUCH EVIDENCE.

02:18:44.582 --> 02:18:47.819
THANK YOU FOR WHERE. BLAME AND

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:48.553
THERE'S THAT WE MAY SEE

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:52.490
HOMELESS. INCREASED BY 45% IN

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:54.993
THIS STATE AND THIS IS ONE TOOL

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:57.595
TO FORCE THE DISCUSSION HOW

02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:03.234
SLOW AT DOWN THIS BILL NO THE

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:07.806
PEOPLE TO GET RENT DON'T WE

02:19:07.872 --> 02:19:18.316
LOVE. AND DON'T GET FOR OF.

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:20.251
BIGGER THAN JUST THINKING HEY.

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:21.820
YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON

02:19:21.886 --> 02:19:23.655
HAS THIS BILL IT'S LEGITIMATELY

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.924
FORCING A CONVERSATION WITH OUT

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:28.727
A VEHICLE A BILL AS A VEHICLE.

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:30.462
WE DON'T HAVE A CONVERSATION

02:19:30.528 --> 02:19:31.596
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.498
IT'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU

02:19:33.565 --> 02:19:34.532
THAT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF IT IN

02:19:34.599 --> 02:19:36.101
PRINT WE'VE HAD LOTS OF

02:19:36.167 --> 02:19:37.936
CONVERSATIONS. LOTS OF IDEAS

02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:39.137
SOME THAT ARE EASIER THAN

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:40.672
OTHERS TO TALK ABOUT AND SOME

02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:42.807
THAT ARE YOU KNOW LESS EASY. AT

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:44.109
TWO TO ACCEPT OR TO THINK ABOUT

02:19:44.175 --> 02:19:46.911
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CLEAR THAT.

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:48.847
YOU KNOW I PUT CONSUMERS FIRST-

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:51.449

LOT OF CONSISTENCY BEHIND

THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THE

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:48.266
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ARE. ARE

02:21:48.333 --> 02:21:50.501

PROPOSALS ARE GIVING FOLKS THE

02:21:58.676 --> 02:21:59.477
WRONG APPROACH THERE IS THERE.

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:00.612
ARE THERE ARE. AFFECTED BUT

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:01.679
THERE'S A MAGIC WAND APPROACH

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:03.081
OUT THERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:03.815
GOING TO WAIVE ITS MAGIC WAND

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:05.450

AND JUST A- IT IS DIFFICULT.

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:25.990
AND I FELT THAT AS MY TERROR

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:28.192
AS- AS MY ROLE AS CHAIR OF THIS

02:24:28.259 --> 02:24:30.361
COMMITTEE- IT WAS MY

02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:31.929
RESPONSIBILITY TO ALSO RAISE

02:24:31.996 --> 02:24:33.331
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:35.299
DIFFICULT TIMES. AND I YOU ALL

OTHER BILL THAT I WAS WORKING

02:24:38.703 --> 02:24:40.738
ON. I TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND

02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:43.141
I DIDN'T DO IT- AND BECAUSE I

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:45.076
HAD PLANNED ON DOING IT. COVERT

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:47.011

CARD. AND THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:52.316
AND SO. I DO THINK IT IS OUR

02:24:52.383 --> 02:24:54.419
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE

02:24:54.485 --> 02:24:55.486
LEGISLATURE TO NOT HIDE. FROM

02:24:55.553 --> 02:24:58.089
DIFFICULT CONVERSE. AND THAT

02:24:58.156 --> 02:25:00.258
BUT TO HAVE. THEM AND FOR THE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.994
GOOD OF. OUR SHE WENT VERY CON.

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:05.596

KNOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:17.241
WE CAN'T. TAKE A BATH. YOUR NOT

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:19.977

HELP FINANCIAL IN. AND THERE IS

02:25:23.414 --> 02:25:25.750
A LOSE LOSE HERE. AND WITH THAT

02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:28.152
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES- IS

02:25:28.219 --> 02:25:30.121
AGAIN IT EXTENDS THE PERIOD OF

02:25:30.188 --> 02:25:31.989
PAYMENT IT DOESN'T FORGIVE THEM

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:36.060
IT EXTENDS IT- AND CERTAINLY WE

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:37.895
ARE COMMITTED TO HAVING THE

02:25:37.962 --> 02:25:39.397
CONVERSATIONS. I THINK THIS

02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:42.300
KIND. AND THE INDUSTRY PARTNERS

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:44.402
CAN ALSO BE AT THE TABLE I TO

02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:45.169
HAVE THESE HEALTHY

02:25:45.236 --> 02:25:46.771
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:47.839
NEEDED IF WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:49.740
SOMETHING- THEY'RE GOING TO

02:25:49.807 --> 02:25:52.276
HURT. WHEN OUR CONSUMERS LOSE

02:25:52.343 --> 02:25:53.744
THEIR HOMES WHEN OUR CONSUMERS

02:25:53.811 --> 02:25:55.379
HAVE THEIR CARS REPOSSESSED

02:25:55.446 --> 02:25:56.781
WHEN OUR CONSUMERS CAN'T PAY

02:25:56.848 --> 02:25:58.916
BACK ANYTHING- THAT IS GOING TO

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:00.852
HURT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:02.019
AND THE SAME REFER PATIENTS

02:26:02.086 --> 02:26:03.888
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:06.457
EXAMPLES HE- HAPPEN BUT JUST

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:07.625
FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. BECAUSE

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.026
WE'VE NOT PROTECTED OUR

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:10.962
CONSUMER FOR THE COUNCIL

02:26:11.028 --> 02:26:13.831
INSTITUTION. DOCTOR WEBER OCCUR

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:16.300
PLEASURE YES- I WANT TO THANK

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.435
YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:19.971
FORWARD I THINK- AS POINTED OUT

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:22.840
THERE ARE. THAT THAT EVERYONE

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:24.208
IS AFFECTED BY WHAT IS TAKING

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:25.543
PLACE AND SO THERE AREN'T ANY

02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:28.846
REALLY- OF PERSONS WHO ARE. OF

02:26:28.913 --> 02:26:30.615
WHO CAN X. GATE THE IMPACT OF

02:26:30.681 --> 02:26:32.416
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE IN

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:34.418
THE STATE AND IN THE NATION. SO

02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:35.920
I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IT

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:37.822
ALSO MEANS A LOT OF ISSUES AND

02:26:37.889 --> 02:26:39.590
CONCERNS OF MY LEASE OF ALREADY

02:26:39.657 --> 02:26:41.025
RAISE THAT I AGREE WITH IN

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:42.994
TERMS OF MAKING SURE. THAT WE

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.295
KNOW WHO THE TARGET HELPING IN

02:26:44.362 --> 02:26:45.930
WHO WE AND WE DON'T DO MORE

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:49.333
HARM THAN GOOD. IN TERMS OF THE

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:51.402
PROP ITSELF. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:55.673
RECOGNIZE OF THAT. THIS IS CREE

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.808
BY A- AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:59.243
FOR IT I MEAN WE HAD NO CHOICE

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:00.745
IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:01.679
IN TERMS OF HEALTH IN THE

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:04.282
STATE. BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:07.818
KIND OF ECONOMIC PROBLEM THIS

02:27:07.885 --> 02:27:09.220
IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CRISIS

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:11.255
THAT WE FACED. AND IT WAS NOT

02:27:11.322 --> 02:27:12.990
BECAUSE THIS RECESSION WAS NOT

02:27:13.057 --> 02:27:14.392
BECAUSE THE MARKET FAIL IN

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:16.194
WASN'T BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.828
INDUSTRY CHANGED AND TECHNOLOGY

02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:19.297
CAME IN AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT

02:27:19.363 --> 02:27:21.465
HAPPENED. WE BASICALLY IT WAS

02:27:21.532 --> 02:27:22.934
MAN MADE IT WAS MADE BY US TO

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.169
STOP. TO STOP THE ECONOMY AND

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:26.437
TO PUT PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND

02:27:26.504 --> 02:27:27.972
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS TO

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:29.774
TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR IN TERMS

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:30.741
OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE WERE

02:27:30.808 --> 02:27:33.211
ELIGIBLE. TO GET UNEMPLOYED

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:34.011
PEOPLE WOULD NEVER THOUGHT

02:27:34.078 --> 02:27:35.613
THEY'D EVER BE NEEDING

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.514
UNEMPLOYMENT WHO HAD BUSINESSES

02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:38.349
AS BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGIST

02:27:38.416 --> 02:27:39.917
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. FOUND

02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:41.986
THEMSELVES WITHOUT OKAY SO THIS

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:44.422
IS A SITUATION WE CREATED AND

02:27:44.488 --> 02:27:45.356
THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THE

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:48.659
BANKING INDUSTRY THINGS OF.

02:27:48.726 --> 02:27:49.260
THAT CREATED EVEN FOR THEM SO

02:27:49.327 --> 02:27:51.529
THEY TO CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE.

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:55.466
TO PRESS. NOT AS IT. OUR WE AS

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:57.134
A LET. CREATED AND TAKE

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:58.803
RESPONSE FOR THAT BECAUSE IT

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:00.171
WAS A HIGHER CALLING IN TERMS

02:28:00.238 --> 02:28:01.272
OF HEALTH AND THE AND THE

02:28:01.339 --> 02:28:03.474
OVERALL GOOD OF THE STATE

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.842
ITSELF IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:06.077
WE WOULD DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC

02:28:06.143 --> 02:28:07.645
AND THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:09.046
CHOICES. AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE A

02:28:09.113 --> 02:28:11.249
PERFECT. BIGGER BUT THE REALITY

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:13.017
IS ALL THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:14.719
THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:16.020
WE'RE HAVING TODAY ARE THINGS

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.655
THAT TAKE YEARS TO COME. ABOUT

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:19.390
TO HOPEFULLY TO ADDRESS. A

02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:21.192
CERTAIN ISSUES. BUT WE DON'T

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:22.660
HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME BECAUSE

02:28:22.727 --> 02:28:24.161
IT IS HERE IT IS NOW WE DIDN'T

02:28:24.228 --> 02:28:25.596
HAVE THAT MUCH TIME WE HAVE TO

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:27.265
SHUT DOWN AND SEND PEOPLE HOME.

02:28:27.331 --> 02:28:28.766
WE DIDN'T WE HAD WE DON'T HAVE

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:30.201
THAT MUCH TIME WAS DECIDED KIDS

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:31.836
CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL. SO

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.070
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE

02:28:33.137 --> 02:28:35.039
DOING IN THE- SAYS IN SEOUL.

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:36.540
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT

02:28:36.607 --> 02:28:38.442
NOW AND I KNOW MY- MANY OF MY

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:39.777
BANKING INDUSTRY'S PARTICULAR

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:40.678
MY CREDIT UNIONS THAT I'VE

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:42.380
WORKED WITH AND- ARE STRUGGLING

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:43.514
WITH THIS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES

02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:45.249
ARE LUMPED IN WITH BANKS AND

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:46.384
THEY REALLY AREN'T BANKS AND-

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:48.286
AND THEY WANT TO BE HEARD THEY

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:49.687
WANT TO BE SEEN BUT THEY ALSO

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:51.489
WANT TO BE HELPFUL. AND I HOPE

02:28:51.555 --> 02:28:52.456
THAT WE WILL BE WILL CONTINUE.

02:28:52.523 --> 02:28:54.058
TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND MAINLY

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:55.426
I'M VOTING FOR BECAUSE THE

02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:57.194

WITH RESPECT THE MORTGAGE

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:05.335
