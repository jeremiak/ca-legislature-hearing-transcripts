THE FIRST ISSUE FOR DISCUSSION IS TAXES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. AND ADMINISTRATION ARE YOU HERE TO PRESENT. A YES MANAGER CALL THE WIFE WITH FORMER FINANCE. OKAY HIT. THANK YOU GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ACKLEY WHY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I WILL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON SOME OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS WITHIN THE TAX. ARSES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AREA ON THE IN AND OUT. REALLY WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SO KEEP SAYING KEEP AN ISSUE NOW IF I BUT IN ITS ONLY BECAUSE- YOU PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU BUT RIGHT NOW WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY GREAT. ON THE AGENDA TODAY THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS THAT COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MINISTRY. RATIONS BROAD BASED RELIEF PACKAGE. FIRST WE HAVE EARLY PROPOSAL MADE BY THE MINISTRATION PROVIDE BROAD BASED RELIEF TO NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS FACING HIGH GAS PRICES. AND% OTHER INFLATION INDUCED PRICE INCREASES. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE A ONE TIME REFUND OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO EACH ELIGIBLE OWNER OF A REGISTERED VEHICLE. THE PROPOSAL CAPS THE NUMBER REBATES TO A REGISTERED VEHICLE OWNER FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL. IT EXCLUDES FLEET AND CORPORATE. CORPORATE ON VEHICLES AND EXCLUDES VEHICLES. OVER CERTAIN VALUE- THIS BROAD BASED REFINER RETURN ESTIMATE ELEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BACK TO TAXPAYERS. A SECOND PREMIER VISION ALSO INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION INSTEAD OF GRANTS TO TRANSIT AND RAIL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSIT FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR THREE MONTHS. AND LASTLY THERE'S A PROPOSED TWELVE MONTH PAUSE ON THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF THE SALES TAX ON DIESEL FUEL. TO HELP BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS RISING FUEL PRICES- MOVING ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC. MY DEVELOPMENTS- WE HAVE MULTIPLE ISSUES THERE AND I WILL HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL OF THE LARGER ISSUES ON THE AGENDA. FIRSTLY REVISION PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVEL OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION PER YEAR. THREE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT SENATE TO BUSINESSES TO LOCATE OR STAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND CREATE QUALITY FULL TIME JOBS IN THE STATE. THIS PROGRAM IS SET TO SUNSET AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- FOR THE MAY REVISION FOR. POSES A SECOND YOUR FUNDING IT HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES GRANT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS TO BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM A NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. AND BUT STILL PRESENT VITAL ECONOMIC ARE EVER CONFRATERNITIES FOR THE STATE THAT ARE AT RISK OF TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE THE STATE. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. HARD HIT INDUSTRIES GRANT PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE WITHIN GO BIZ THIS GRANT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE. FIVE RELIEF GRANTS OF CAN ATTEND INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. OF THE ORIGINALS INCLUDES SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS DROUGHT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. TO PROVIDE GRANTS OF BUSINESSES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE DROUGHT. THESE BUSINESSES INCLUDE FARMERS AS WELL AS MANY TYPES OF SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS. THIS PROGRAM FUNCTIONS SIMILARLY TO EXISTING COMING NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN CONSULTATION WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AND THEN MOVING ON TO THE ITEMS UNDER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD- THE FIRST ISSUE IS THE LATE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM OR PPP CONFORMITY. A PREVIOUS CONFORMITY ACTION BY THE STATE DID NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN LATE ISSUED FEDERAL PPP GRANTS YOU TO A FEDERAL EXTENSION. AND THIS CHANGE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PPP GRANTS TO CAL. FORTY BUSINESSES ARE TREATED EQUITABLY I WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO STICK TAXATION. THE NARRATION INCLUDES TWO EXPANSIONS TO THE STATE'S YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT BY INDEXING THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT TO INFLATION. AND ALLOWING ZERO INCOME RETURNS TO CLAIM THIS CREDIT WHICH ALLOWS MORE FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN TO BENEFIT FROM THIS MEAN FOR CREDIT AND TO PREVENT INFLATION FROM ERODING THE VALUE OF THE CREDIT- A REVISION ALSO INCLUDES A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR. A NEW ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX. CREDIT AND THERE IS INCLUDES A TAXPAYER PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW TAXPAYERS. UNDER CERTAIN INCOME LIMITS TO PAY THEIR TAXES FOR THE TWENTY ONE TAX YEARS. BY SEPTEMBER THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITHOUT INCURRING ANY INTEREST OR PENALTIES. I'VE BEEN A REVISION INCLUDES POSITIONS AND FUNDING FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FOR THE EXPANSIONS THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT THE NEW FOSTER YOU THE ITC AND THE TAXPAYER PAYMENT. FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM THAT I JUST NOTED. IN ADDITION THERE'S FUNDING INCLUDED FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO EXPAND ITS VOLUNTARY INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE SERVICES TO REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT YOU SERVICES DEVELOPMENT FOR ADMINISTRATORS IN MINISTRY TO CALORIFIC AND TAX CREDIT GRANTS. AND TEN MILLION IN ONGOING GRANT FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOUR. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO FUND EDUCATION OUTREACH FOR THE CALLIE ITC PROGRAM AND FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICES. FURTHER AS IT RELATES TO THE I. T. SEEN THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES. A FUNDING FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO DO TARGET OUTREACH TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF THE ITC. AND INCREASE ITS UPTAKE FOR THERE IS A FUNDING INCLUDED FOR DATA UPGRADES AND INCREASED LITIGATION COSTS. ALSO THAT INCLUDES MY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS WITHIN- THE TAXES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AREA I AM JOINED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE PHARMA FINANCE AS WELL AS FRANCHISE TAX BOARD GO BIZ AND CD TFA. TO HELP WITH ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- L. A. O. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE COMMENT. THE MANAGER A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR- HUH- COMMENTS ON THE ISSUES THAT ON THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE JUST DISCUSSED WE WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME OVERALL TAKEAWAYS OF THE MAY REVISION. OF FEE TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER THESE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ON THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS WOMEN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET. SO THE MAY REVISION ALLOCATED FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN OVERALL GENERAL FUND SURPLUS. AND IN ADDITION WE ESTIMATE THE GOVERNOR HAD A THIRTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS WITHIN THE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET. ALLOCATED DISCRETIONARY PURPOSES BILLION DOLLARS OF PROPOSALS THAT MEET THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT REQUIREMENTS. AND THE TWO LARGEST CATEGORIES OF PROPOSALS ARE THE ELEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REFUNDS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST PRESENTED ON. AS WELL AS A THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. IN THIS WE'VE SOME SO REQUIREMENTS AND ADDRESSED ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION MEETS THE CELL REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEARS THE GOVERNOR LEAVES. THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDRESS ALL REQUIREMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE IN THIS SENSE OF THE FISCAL CLIFF IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. SO WE ESTIMATE THE STATE WOULD FACE AN ADDITIONAL CELL REQUIREMENT OF OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND THE REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS REQUIREMENT AS A RESULT THE STATE WOULD VERY LIKELY FACE A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR. AND COMPOUNDING THIS CONCERNS CERTAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS HISTORICALLY HAVE OFFERED WITH WARNING SIGNS THAT A RECESSION IS ON THE HORIZON. AND MANY OF THESE INDICATORS CURRENTLY INDICATE S. R. SUGGEST A HEIGHTENED RISK OF RECESSION WITHIN TWO YEARS SO WE RECOMMEND INCREASING RESERVES RESERVES WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO THE STATE MAINTAINING ITS CURRENT PROGRAM. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANTLY HEIGHTENED BUDGETARY RISKS THE STATE NOW FACES AS A RESULT OF EITHER THE REQUIREMENTS OF SALARY POSSIBLE RECESSION SO. TURNING NOW TO THE TAX REBATE FOR. A PROPOSALS AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP HAVE PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE RELIEF PACKAGE OF EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THIS BETTER FOR FAMILIES TAX REBATE AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA HAS THREE COMPONENTS. THE FIRST WOULD PROVIDE AN INCOME TAX REBATE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TAXPAYER PLUS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR DEPENDENCE FOR SINGLE FILERS EARNING OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND JOINT. FILERS EARNING UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. THIS PACKAGE WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A SUPPLEMENTAL ONE TIME MONTHLY GRANT FOR CULVERTS FAMILIES AND SS I. SS P. RECEIVED. LASTLY THE LATEST TAX PACK WOULD FINE. THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR OTHER LIVING HEALTH TAXES. AS YOU WE THESE PROPOSALS- FOR- IN TAX RELIEF ARE WE SUGGEST THAT YOU DESIGN A PACKAGE. CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING FOUR ELEMENTS. FIRST WE- WE SUGGEST LEGISLATURE DESIGNED A PACKAGE THAT TARGETS RELIEF TO THE GROUPS THAT IT WANTS TO PRIORITIZE A FOR EXAMPLE CATEGORIES OF FOCUS COULD INCLUDE THOSE EXPERIENCING HIGHER FUEL PRICES THOSE EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST FINANCIAL HARDSHIP OR RESIDENTS WHO ARE BROADLY AFFECTED BY HIGHER PRICED- WE SUGGEST YOU DESIGN A PACKAGE THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. THE SPEED AT WHICH EACH POLICY OPTION COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WILL VARY BASED ON FACTORS. SUCH AS WHETHER IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED FOR A NEW PROGRAMMER THROUGH AN EXISTING PROGRAM AND WE SUGGEST YOUR PACKAGE ALIGNS WITH YOUR OTHER POLICY AND BUDGET PRIORITIES NOW LAST WEEK WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED A PACKAGE THAT HELPS THE STATE NEEDED SELL REQUIREMENTS SO. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO DESIGN A RELIEF PACKAGE THAT FOCUSES ON MEETING THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CELL. SUCH AS SPENDING ON EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES AND TAX REFUNDS. SO TURNING TO THE- THE ITEMS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- I'M ON THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS HARD HIT INDUSTRIES GRANT PROGRAM. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE WILD RAPID ECONOMIC RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES WAS A PRIORITY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ARE CONCERNED THESE PROGRAMS HOW TO MAKE TRADE OFFS IN TRANSPARENCY. AND OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE TARGETING THAT ARE NO LONGER WARRANTED IN OUR OPINION. NOW THE ECONOMY IS LARGELY RECOVERED. AND WE RECOMMEND- OF REJECTING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUSINESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PROPOSED HARD. INDUSTRY'S GRANT AND REDIRECTING THESE FUNDS FOR OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND SIMILARLY- WE ALSO- RECOMMEND REJECTING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SIMILAR PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD- CREATED IT WOULD HAVE CREATED A NEW RAPID DISPERSAL. GRANT PROGRAMMING GO BIZ- OFFICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE TO MAKE GRANTS TO SMALLER AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY DROUGHT. IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS. RAISED REGARDING OF THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAMS WE NOTE. THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT. ADDRESS ANY OF THE UNDERLYING WATER AVAILABILITY. ISSUES OR WATER EFFICIENCY. AND THEN- THE- AND CLEAN ENERGY FINANCING PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSAL MIGHT HAVE MERIT. ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SUBSIDIZING PRIVATE ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION PROJECTS IS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE SO- THAT'S ON TOP IS TURNING TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. ON THE PROPOSAL TO ADMINISTER A TAX PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM WHILE THE WELL THIS PROGRAM COULD HAVE SOME MERIT THIS- TAX SIMPLICITY PROGRAM WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THE MODEST BENEFITS TO TAXPAYERS JUSTIFY THE RELATIVELY HIGH COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. IS ADMINISTERED. AS ESTIMATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THEN THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF FUNDING FOR A REACH FOR THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND FOR TAX PREPARATION ASSISTANCE FOR LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS. AND THOSE PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT IN OUR ESTIMATION HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO IS PROPOSING TO FUND A NEW PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROACTIVELY CONTACT HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING. ELIGIBLE FOR STATE EITC BUT CANNOT CLAIM ONE THIS IS THE TARGETED EITC OUT REACH PROPOSAL AND WHILE THIS. COULD SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE PROPOSAL ON ITS FACE BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS BY OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM WOULD LIKELY BE HIGHLY INEFFECTIVE. SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR R. T. COMMENTS ON THEIR TAXES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PORTION OF THE AGENDA BUT- WE'RE PREPARED TO DISCUSS RESPOND OR QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHER ME REVISION ITEMS THAT WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY MENTION. I'LL GREAT SO. I- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE JUST YOU KNOW ON THE FACE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE TO RESPOND AT LEAST TWO OF THE OPENING SALVO I THINK MADE BY L. A. L. AS IT RELATES TO- A RECESSION. THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND THE NEED TO ACTUALLY SAVING BE MORE STRATEGIC. WELL WE ARE WE ARE WE THIS CALL THE WHITE PART OF THE FINANCE WE YOU KNOW WE AGREED THAT STATES SHOULD BE- STRATEGIC AND- AND WE HAVE. A LOT OF OUR PROPOSED SPENDING THAT IS IN THE BUDGET IS ONE TIME AND- AND WE ALSO HAVE. A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESERVES IN THE CASE OF A YOU TO THE RAINY DAY FUND- AS FAR AS RECESSION SELF THAT'S- THAT'S- A- OF SOMEONE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY ANY TYPE OF PRECISION WEEK PREPARING ECONOMIC FORECAST- THAT IS. BASED ON. A GLOBAL- AN INTERNATIONAL FORECASTING FIRM AND THEN WE TRANSLATE THAT INTO CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC FIRM THAT HAS A BROAD VARIETY OF ASSUMPTIONS IT DOESN'T EXPECT ESTIMATES COULD EXPLICITLY ARE RECESSION BUT- BUT WE DO ASSUME. FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR FORECAST WE MAKE AN ASSUMPTION. WITH REGARD TO- CAPITAL GAINS- DECLINE IN TAX YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THE CLIENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STOCK MARKET SO WE'VE TAKEN. THE LATEST DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US AND MADE A FORECAST. THAT WE FEEL IS- IS THE BEST ESTIMATION OF A OF A FORECAST INSTEAD YOU KNOW IT REASONABLY CONSERVATIVE FORECAST FOR THE STATE GOING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU SAID I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE. ON CALL AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL OR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY SIX PEOPLE. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUE I'M HOPING TO GOODNESS THAT SOMEONE IS ON THE LINE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. VICE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR TO FINANCE. PLEASE WHY IS THE- THROUGH ICE TO TARGET. AS YOU'RE DOING I NEED TO PROPERLY EXPLAINED SOME OF IT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THE STATE NEVER DOES SEEM TO GET THINGS RIGHT EDT MOST RECENTLY AND I'M EXPECTING A LOT OF CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS COMING FORWARD THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR CHECK OR WHATEVER. BECAUSE THE FIASCOS THAT ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS OCCUR. WOULD IT NOT BE MORE SIMPLE JUST TO MAKE A STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION IN THE GAS TAX FOR A TIME CERTAIN. ANY ANY REDUCTION TO THE TO THE GAS TAX HAS AS A COUPLE- A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH IT- ONE IS THAT YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY SEE POTENTIALLY ALL OF THE SAVINGS FLOW FOR TO CONSUMERS BY. TWO AS IT PERTAINS TO THE- THE GAS TAX ON GASOLINE WHICH IS- PRIMARILY AN EXCISE TAX THOSE THOSE FUNDS ARE EARMARKED FOR A LOCAL AND STATE TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES AND WOULD REQUIRE MOST LIKELY REQUIRE BACK FEELS IN ORDER TO- IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE FUNDS. FUNDS HOLE SO IT'S NOT A NOT AS ITS FACE. THANK YOU BUT I REITERATE I'M EXPECTING A LOT OF CALLS. IS THAT IT YES OKAY A SENATOR ROTH. SURE I GUESS THIS IS TO FINANCE TO ON THE SAME TAX REBATE PROPOSAL WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR- THE VEHICLE VALUE LIMITATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO FOR AT THAT QUESTION I WILL. HELLO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TERESA KALBURGI. AN INCREASE TO COVER WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT IN THAT BROAD BASED REALLY PROPOSAL IN THIS REFUND- SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE. A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE- LIMITATIONS OR PARAMETERS THAT WOULD BE AROUND EVERY TIME SO YOU MENTION ONE WHICH IS THAT KIND OF A THRESHOLD VALUE- M. AS DETERMINED BY DMV PURSUANT TO EXISTING EVALUATION PROCESS SAYS THERE'S ALSO- OF LIVING UP TO PER REGISTERED VEHICLE OWNER AND THEN THERE'S ALSO AN EXCLUSION FOR FLEETS AND CORPORATE OWNED VEHICLES. AND THIS IS AGAIN TRYING TO TARGET TO THOSE- THAT- THAT MOST NEED IT AND ALSO. PROVIDE THAT YOU KNOW REASONABLE. PARAMETERS AND THIS IS PART OF OUR- REMEMBER LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE AS WELL THAT COULD OF DESCRIBE. THE PARAMETERS FOR A PROPOSED SO WHAT IS THE VALUE LIMITATION. RIGHT NOW THE TRAILER BILL DOESN'T HAVE IT LISTED- AS A PLACE HOLDER AND WE EXPECT THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND- AND NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS AND- THE LEGISLATUE PROPOSAL FOR HER REFUND AND RELIEF WELL I HOPE WE SPENT A LITTLE TIME ON IT BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE. THINKING ABOUT MILLIONAIRES WHO DRIVE TESLAS BUT YOU KNOW. OF LOWER MIDDLE INCOME INDIVIDUALS SO AND ALSO HAVE VERY EXPENSIVE OF TRUCKS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY USE OR ISSUE VIS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO MOVE. THE FAMILY MEMBERS AROUND IN A VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS WHY SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE A VEHICLE THAT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE PRICEY. AND MAY IN FACT REPRESENT A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE- NET INCOME OF THE FAMILY INVOLVED BUT- JUST SETTING A VALUE OF COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE- SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THAT ITEM PAWS ON AN INCREASE IN STATE DIESEL TAXES AYE. I'M NOT ABLE TO TELL FROM THE ANALYSIS EXACTLY WHAT THAT ENTAILS. OTHER THAN THE PLAIN LANGUAGE- IN THE ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO REDUCE. THE PRICE OF DIESEL AT THE PUMP. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF DIESEL UPON SO THE EXAM. THE EXEMPTION IS A GENERAL FUND EXEMPTION SALES TAX EXEMPTION ON THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE OF THE PRICE OF A WITH A- 4% RATE THAT'S APPLIED TO THE- TO THE- TAXES TAXABLE DIESEL FUEL SALES SO. IT SHOULD LOWER THE PRICE OF DIESEL OUT OF FIVE BY IN THE FULL AMOUNT. SO WHY NOT MAYBE THIS QUESTION WAS YES. IN A SENSE BY MY COLLEAGUE THE VICE CHAIR BUT WHY NOT SUSPEND THE TAX ALTOGETHER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE- BOTH THE PAUSE ON THE INCREASE AND A SUSPENSION WOULD BOTH SEEM TO ME HAVE A- AN IMPACT ON THE DIRECTED TRANSPORTATION FUND ACCOUNT. WELL THAT THE DIESEL- THE GENERAL FUND SALES TAX ON THE DIESEL FUEL IS- IS A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT ANIMAL SO TO SPEAK AND- EXCISE TAXES ON THE- ON THE GAS SIDE SO ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE IS- THERE ARE EARMARKS RELATED TO- RELATED TO THAT. THE SALES TAX ON DIESEL FUEL THAT GO TO THE PUBLIC RITESH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER. IT IS SAD THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDES A AYE BACKFILL PROVISION THAT ENSURES THAT THE SAME THE SAME AMOUNT WILL GO WILL GO TO THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNT. UNDER CURRENT LAW OR UNDER THE PROPOSED A UNDER THE PROPOSED A SALES TAX FOR THIS WAS THIS WAS SIMPLY A CHOICE THAT WAS MADE BY THE- ADMINISTRATION TO DO IT FOR DIESEL BUT NOT FOR GASOLINE. WELL I'M NOT A AND BY THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND BACK FILL. IT WAS A CHOICE SIDE ON THE DIESEL SIDE WE HAVE- WE HAVE DIESEL PRICES THAT ARE THAT ARE HIGHER THAN GASOLINE SIDE IN AND FOR THE GAS WE MADE A DECISION TO- TO- DO THE DO THE REBATE PROPOSAL WHICH IS INTENDED TO. ALLEVIATE THE- THE PAIN AT THE PUMP FOR GAS PRICES FOR CONSUMERS WHERE AS DIESEL WILL BENEFIT- WILL BENEFIT TO A LARGE EXTENT- IT WILL BENEFIT- SMALL BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS IN GENERAL AND THEN IT WILL BE INDIRECTLY THAT. OKAY THANK THANK YOU FOR THE CONSUMERS THANK YOU FOR THE SPOTS BUT WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR LET ME JUST JUMP AHEAD WITH ONE. YOUNG OTHER THERE IS A COMMENTS IN A QUESTION HAVING TO DO WITH CAL COMPETES THE TAX CREDIT EXPANSION AND GRANT PROGRAM WHICH I SUPPORT A THOUSAND PERCENT- HOWEVER I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I THINK I WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN. FIRST A COUPLE COMMENTS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROGRAM RINA- AND THE HOUSING ALLOCATION PROCESS WHICH REGIONS EVEN THOUGH IT'S A PLANNING PROCESS AND NOT A BUILDING PROCESS IT HAS. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT PARTICULARLY IN THE INLAND REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND WE HAVE THIS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES- PROCESS AND SERIES OF PROGRAMS THE PERIMETER AT LEAST RESTRICT. CURRENTLY OR AND PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY PROJECTS THAT ADD VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED OR VMT. AND WE HAVE GO BILLS WITH THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND SOME OF THE GO BIZ. STATE MONEY HAS BEEN DIRECTED CERTAINLY IN THE PAST AND CONTINUES TO BE ON SOME LEVEL. TO THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS WHERE WHEN YOU HAVE EXPANDED BUSINESSES OR NEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE RECRUITED. THE NEW WORKERS IN THOSE BUSINESSES ARE UNABLE TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEN ARE FORCED TO MOVE INLAND. WHETHER IT'S INLAND CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED PARTS ARE FORCED TO MOVE INLAND AND THEN COMMUTE TO THEIR JOBS IN ORDER TO SECURE. THE FORTY WILL HOUSING AND SO IN THOSE INLAND AREAS WHEN WE HAVE THOSE WORKERS. AND BILL THAT HOUSING THAT RINNA REQUIRES. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULES WE ARE UNABLE TO A HAD TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY PROJECTS TO MOVE WORKERS FROM THEIR HOMES TO THEIR JOBS BECAUSE IT INCREASES. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. SO THOSE OF THE COMMENTS THE QUESTION IS. HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT LINKING THE CAL COMPETES AWARD PROGRAM AND THE AWARDS THAT ARE GENERATED. THE CERTIFICATIONS BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THE JURISDICTION HAS. OR WILL ENSURE THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT. WORKER AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THESE NEW WORKERS THAT WERE PAYING. TO RELOCATE OR COME TO CALIFORNIA FOR THESE JOBS I GUESS IT GOES TO FINANCE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WILL I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT A CO PAYS FOR THAT. THAT QUESTION. CENTER THINGS THE QUESTION- IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CURRENTLY DISCUSS I THINK WE'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OR YOUR OFFICE ON THE PROPOSAL. WELL THANK YOU BECAUSE IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND I'VE FOR IT TO BE QUITE HONEST I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY TRACTION. RECENTLY THAT THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION OR TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SAID THERE WILL BE NO. NEW CAPACITY PROGRAMS. AND THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM. BECAUSE THE HOUSING PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE WILL BE MORE HOUSING. GO BUSINESS SAYING WE'RE ENCOURAGING MORE JOBS SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW COORDINATE AND THAT'S NOT THIS IS NOT THE FORUM FOR THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW IT OUT. WE NEED TO SOMEHOW COORDINATOR STATE POLICIES SO FRANKLY THAT MAKES SENSE AND RIGHT NOW TO ME. THESE DON'T MAKE SENSE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPONSORED FORWARD TO. HE WAS SPEAKING AND WORKING WITH YOU ON IT THANK YOU MA'AM SURE FOR YOUR PATIENCE THANK YOU. SENATOR KABIRU. I THINK- CENTER YOU JUST OPENED UP THAT CAN OF WORMS ON THAT ONE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT- IT MAY EVEN MAKE MORE SENSE- TO- EXAMINE WHETHER THAT JURISDICTION IS BUILDING THE READING NUMBERS BEFORE THEY CAN CAN THEY CAN GET A COW COMPETES GRANT BECAUSE- HI IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE THAN YOU DESCRIBED IT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WANTS TO MAKE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ROADWAYS- THERE ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING STATE FUNDS TO DO THAT- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. YOU CAN'T USE IT TO IMPROVE- COMMUTER TRAFFIC SO TO SPEAK AND I AND I THINK THAT INCLUDES A HIGHWAYS AS WELL SO EVEN EVEN SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THAT'LL PROTECT THE PUBLIC CANNOT BE IMPROVED- SO- BUT I'M- MOVING ON TO RENT ANOTHER ISSUE- I JUST HAVE A QUESTION I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT. THE DIFFERENT FUNDS AND I'M NOT SURE. I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IS BUT- WHEN WE WERE DOING THEY DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS DURING THAT- THE WORST PART OF AT LAST YEAR DURING THAT CORONA VIRUS OUTBREAK- WE WERE APPROACHED BY SMALL INDEPENDENT THEATERS TO EAT BEING INCLUDED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT VENUE CATEGORY UNDER THE BUDGET. AND WE DIDN'T WE DID NOT END UP DOING THAT WE DID NOT CAPTURE THE REQUEST AND I'M WONDERING AS I LOOK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT FIND HERE- UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS HARD HIT INDUSTRY GRANT PROGRAM THERE THERE ARE- ARTS ENTERTAINMENT AND RECREATION BUT IT'S NOT SPECIFIC IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT OR EXCLUDE SMALL INDEPENDENT THEATERS AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD CONSIDERED THAT. HAD MADE A DECISION TO EITHER INCLUDE OR NOT INCLUDE THOSE SMALL INDEPENDENT THEATERS. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. AT THIS CENTER THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN- THE UNDER SPECIFICALLY UNDER THAT CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANTS PROGRAMS THE SMALL BUSINESSES- THERE ARE ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THAT- HOWEVER- THE INDEPENDENT THEATERS WOULD WOULD NOT BE I BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT BE ELIGIBLE ON THIS ONE- AS WELL AS THE- LINED IN USE ONE SO I THINK THAT- WE- WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU ON OUR- OKAY WELL I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT. THAT- THAT THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED AS ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS IF YOU IF YOU- BELIEVE OTHERWISE IF YOU COULD GET IN TOUCH AND LET US KNOW I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SMALL INDEPENDENT THEATERS IN- IN RURAL CALIFORNIA THEY COULD THERE WERE REALLY ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO I THINK TO HELP THE MACHINE WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS AND THEN- JUST- MADAM CHAIR ON IBM. YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO LOOK IN IN THE CRYSTAL BALL BUT- BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT I APPRECIATE THE L. A. O.'S CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THESE FUNDS- WE INSTITUTED A NUMBER. OF GRANT PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GET. MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN OUR ECONOMY- AND- I'M WONDERING IF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS- ARE REALLY APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT. THE CHANGIN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU WILL AND I THINK THE CAUTION ABOUT THE HEIGHTENED RISK RISK OF RECESSION WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE COUPLE YEARS IS SOMETHING AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY FEELING THE STRAIN OF THE HIGHER GAS PRICES THE HIGHER THE RISK THAT THE- INFLATION- THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY- THE STOCK MARKET IT'S I'M ASSUMING IS REACTING TO- TO. THE WAR AND- PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED AND I THINK- RIGHTFULLY- SCARED ABOUT THAT. WHERE WHERE EXACTLY ARE KANEMI IS GOING AND- THE GOOD THING IS THAT EMPLOYMENT IS UP WAGES ARE UP THERE SAID JUST SOME REALLY GOOD POSITIVE STUFF BUT THE EMPLOYMENT BEING UP AND WAGES BEING IS NOT WHAT FILLS OUR COFFERS. SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HER A RECESSION I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SPENDING MONEY THAT WE IN THE LONG TERM CAN'T SUPPORT IN SO- HOPE HOPEFULLY WE TAKE A- TAKE THAT TO HEART. AND- THAT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS PORTION OF THE BUDGET SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. A VERY QUICK FOLLOW UP COMMENT TO FINANCE. THE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA DO NOT HAVE THE ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT WE HAVE OTHER ATTRACTIONS AND LYFT SUSTAINING AND JOYFUL THANKS. BUT THE SMALL INDEPENDENT THEATERS I THINK IT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT THE GOVERNOR OF THE FINANCE WOODFILL PURPOSEFULLY IGNORE THEIR NEEDS THEY ARE NOT HUGE BUT THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT IN THESE COMMUNITIES I WOULD PLEASE THE YOU TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO YOUR DIRECTORS IN FINANCE AND LET IT KNOW THOUGH THAT THAT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA AND IT CAN'T BE JUST SUMMARILY DISMISSED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MANY UP. OKAY THAT'S IT YES YOUR DROP IN MIKE'S OVER THERE VICE CHAIR. ARM SO I TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- FOR FINANCE THE FIRST IS AROUND- THE TAX REBATE PROPOSAL- AT THE VEHICLE- THREE GREAT. SO YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE AS I'M LISTENING TO YOU AS SENATOR ROTH WAS ASKING QUESTIONS I WAS THINKING- OF SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCENARIOS YOU HAVE SCENARIOS WHERE FOLKS OWN CARS THAT MAYBE THEY CAN OR CAN'T AFFORD AND IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO JUDGE SOMEBODY FOR THE KIND OF CAR THAT THEY PURCHASE BUT- IT WAS MENTIONED THAT IT IT SOME VEHICLES OVER A CERTAIN VALUE WOULD BE EXCLUDED AS WELL AS- CERTAIN AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL CARS. SO THERE ARE FOLKS THAT DO THAT THERE ARE FOLKS- YOU KNOW IS IT PER FAMILY IS IT PER HOUSEHOLD YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF KIDS AND MANY OF THE KIDS HAVE CARS YOU HAVE SOME INSTANCES WHERE YOU KNOW FOLKS WERE DIVORCED IN MAY BE A PARENT WHO NO LONGER LIVE STATE PURCHASED A CAR OUT OF STATE FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN THAT LIVES HERE IS THAT A SCENARIO WHERE THAT CAR WOULD BE EXEMPT- IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT OFF I MEAN WHERE I LIVE GAS THE SIX DOLLARS AND FIFTY SEVEN CENTS- YOU KNOW PER GALLON. AND SO HOW ARE YOU CREE HOW WOULD YOU CREATE A PROGRAM A REBATE PROGRAM THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO TARGET. ALL OF THE KINDS OF FOLKS THAT YOU ARE WANTING TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF FOLKS THAT HAVE CARS. NOTE THAT IN AN ENTIRELY REGISTRY TO COLOR WITH APARTMENT F. AND ANSWERED A LOT OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND SO THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR. RIGHT REGISTER VEHICLE WOULD BE LINKED TO THAT REGISTERED VEHICLE OWNER SO THEY'D B THE LIMIT UP TO HER- REGISTERED OWNERS OWNERS OF REGISTERED VEHICLES- AGAIN ARE YOU KNOW WE TRIED. BE CLEAR AND KIND OF ENVISION THE PARAMETERS THAT WOULD BE BUILT AROUND THIS TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF. SHOW WHERE- THAT CHECKS MIGHT BE EXPECTED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO HAVE IT AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION AS WE HAVE- SOME SUPPORT DOLLARS A CONTRACT ALL. THE MOTOR VEHICLE BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATE. FOLKS WILL BE CALLING AND ASKING ABOUT- THESE CHECKS SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF LAY OUT THE FRAMEWORK IN THAT LANGUAGE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT COULD BE- CONTEMPLATED HERE. YOU ALSO HAVE SCENARIOS WHERE SOMEONE MAY HAVE A CAR AND MAYBE THE PERSON THAT THE CAR IS REGISTERED TO. YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN A CUSTODY BATTLE MAYBE THERE YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW SORT OF. A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR ALL CAPS IN THE AREA SO I JUST I THINK REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE REALITIES OF VEHICLE OWNERS AND HOW THEY HAVE CARS. IN IN IN WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL AND THEN IT SAYS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE MONTHS OF FREE TRANSIT SERVICE SO IS THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS GETTING ACCESS TO THREE MONTHS OF FREE TRANSIT SERVICES IT IN CERTAIN REGIONS IS IT UP TO A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT. IS IT. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY I MEAN WHAT IS THAT. YEAH AND THAT'S BEING THEM AND THE TRANSPORTATION AREA AS OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THROUGH THE LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD HAVE A GRANT THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER TO TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER BOX REVENUES AND IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GRANT THEY WOULD PROVIDE THAT THREE MONTHS OF FREE TRANSIT TO THEIR TO THEIR CUSTOMERS SO IT'S NOT TO A PERSON IT'S THROUGH THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES. I SEE AND SO THEN BACK TO THE CARS WHO WOULD ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM WHO ACTUALLY WOULD BE SENDING OUT THE CHECKS. DO RIGHT NOW AS PART OF A REVISION PROPOSAL WE HAVE IT BUDGETED AS PART OF WITH A CONTRACT AND THEN ALSO- ENVISIONING THAT M. DMB WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD RELATED TO I GET CALLS INQUIRIES RELATED TO THOSE SO RIGHT NOW THAT IS BUDGETED AND PROPOSED AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES BUT AGAIN A THIRD A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR IS ENVISIONED. TO HELP WITH THAT. IN YOUR CALCULATING THE FEES THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. YEAH THE MADE IT BASED ON OTHER DEPARTMENTS- EXPERIENCES AND THEN FOR THE PORT SIDE FOR YOU CAN BE USED- SUPPORT AND ALLEN DOLLARS WERE LOOKING AND THEY HAVE LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS KIND OF A- A MODEL IN THE FRAMEWORK SO THESE ARE OUR- BEST ESTIMATES OF WORK WITHIN CONTRACT EXPENDITURES AT THIS TIME. OKAY I'M MOVING ON TO THE HARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES GRANTS I IT IN HERE IT DOES MENTION- WHO THE ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS COULD BE A THE CRITERIA BUT IT'S BASED ON FEDERAL CODES AND SO I THINK THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT HARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES NATIONALLY MAY MAKE THE HARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. IS. THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING. I TAKE THAT IN AT BRIAN RUTLEDGE BUDGET OFFICE. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WERE USING THE FEDERAL CODES. BECAUSE THEY'RE- THEY'RE USED- WOULD YOU APPLY FOR YOUR TAXES BURKE FOR MOST BUSINESSES JUST SORT OF A I CONVENIENCE THING. WHAT DID THE DATA THAT WE'RE USING TO IDENTIFY THE INDUSTRY'S THAT'S BASED ON IN CALIFORNIA. SO THESE WERE THE TEN HARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- FROM FROM THE COBIT. IMPACTS WELL I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE TIME THAT I HAVE SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE WHEN WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT- PARALLELS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES. CONVENIENCE IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST BAROMETER FOR WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA- SO I JUST WANT TO SORT OF. LAY THAT OUT THERE BUT THEN ALSO YOU KNOW OUT REACH AND HOW THESE ENTITIES WOULD APPLY TO GET THIS MONEY. IS DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT OUR THOUGHTS QUESTION- WELL WE'LL KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON ON EQUITY INCLUSION HERE. CALLOW IS VA IN PARTICULAR NOT JUST WITH THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM BUT WITH OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO THE WAY THAT THE HARD HIT INDUSTRIES WOULD WORK IN TERMS OF MAXIMIZING AWARENESS MAXIMIZING- INCLUSIVITY OF YOU KNOW A SMALL BUSINESS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE. THE RESOURCES I IN MY NEEDS SOME HELP IDENTIFYING THIS AND APPLYING THE WAY WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS THAT IS. THROUGH THE CODE RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY IS EXIST WE BUILT OUT A NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS NONPROFITS AND IT'S BASICALLY A STATEWIDE NETWORK THAT HAS GOTTEN BETTER OVER THE TWO YEARS THAT WE'VE NOW DONE DISCOVERED RELIEF GRANTS. SO WE WOULD LEVERAGE THAT EXISTING NETWORK TO- TO GET THE WORD OUT. THAT THAT INCLUDES WE'D ALSO DO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES FOR THE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS- SO WE SO WE DO HAVE A PLAN FOR MAXIMIZING. AWARENESS AND GETTING EVERYONE- APPLYING THAT THAT. COULD POTENTIALLY APPLY HERE. I'M JUST HOPING AS YOU ALL ARE DUSTING OFF THESE PLANS THAT YOU'RE ALSO TWEAKING THEM BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD DURING COVE IT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS RESOURCES THAT WERE BEING PROVIDED BY THE STATE- AND WE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT. REPEATED I MEAN WE HAVE THIS HUGE SURPLUS AND FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE WHERE'S THE MONEY AND HOW DO I GET IT INTO FOR STILL USING THE SAME OLD PLAYBOOKS. WE'RE GONNA BE IN FOR A LOT OF DISGRUNTLED FOLKS LEGITIMATELY SO. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH WELL WILL KNOWLEDGE THE POINT AND SAY THAT. IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING A LEARNING CURVE FOR- CAL OCA AND OUR PARTNERS AS WE SORT OF. HAD THAT UNPRECEDENTED PROGRAM AT AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE- WE WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT. WE'VE WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT NETWORK WE'VE NOW BUILT OUT- THE PRACTICE- YOU KNOW STANDARDIZING READING- MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND MEDIA CAMPAIGNS. THAT SORT OF THING IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL. FOR THIS PURPOSE PROGRAM SO- THE KNOWLEDGE IT- THE POINT. THANK YOU SO THE L. A. O. SAID WE SHOULD FLAT OUT REJECT THE CALIFORNIA SMALL AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS DROUGHT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. MY QUESTION IS HM HOW WAS THIS FUNDING AMOUNTS SIZED N. B. HOW IS THIRTY THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GOING TO HELP. A FARM DEALING WITH. SEVERE DROUGHT ISSUES I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FARMING BUT FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH FOLKS WHO REPRESENT FARMERS THAT WOULDN'T GO VERY FAR. THANK YOU FOR BOTH THOSE QUESTIONS WE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE QUESTIONS THAT WE GRAPPLED WITH. DESIGN THE PROGRAM. FIRST ONE IN TERMS OF SIZE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION REPRESENTS WHAT WE THINK. IT'S THAT WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN AVAILABLE RESOURCES WHICH- THIS ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON FISCAL RESILIENCY. NOT JUST IN THE IMMEDIATE BUDGET YEAR BUT IN THE OUT YEARS. AND SO SEVENTY FIVE WAS A WHITE COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE HERE BUT ALSO MAKE AN ACTUAL IMPACT SO SEVENTY FIVE. WERE PRIORITIZING FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO FOCUS ON THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I AS A PRIORITY IN TERMS OF APPLICANTS SO WE THINK IF. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE WHEN OUT SPECIFICALLY IN THAT REGION THAT WOULD MAKE A DRAMATIC IMPACT AND WHAT- WITH OUR CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS- HAS BEEN CLEARLY ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT PLACES. SO THAT THAT HELPS GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SIZE. IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL GRANTS AMOUNTS AND HOW WE THINK THIS MIGHT MAKE AN IMPACT. WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIRTY THE GRANT SIZES ARE THIRTY FORTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND. WE THINK THAT'S GOING HAVE. AN ACTUAL INJECTION THAT HELPS. FINANCIAL OPERATIONS FOR THE STRUGGLING BUSINESSES WE'RE NOT SAYING WE DON'T HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT'S GOING TO COMPLETELY ERASE- WHATEVER REVENUE YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT'S- THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE GOAL OR- WE DON'T HAVE THAT ILLUSION- WE WILL KNOW THOUGH THAT THE SIZES OF GRANTS ARE LARGER THAN WITH THE COVERT RELEASED GRANT PROGRAM. THE SPECIFIC REASON FOR THE LARGER GRANT AMOUNTS IS WE DESIGNED THEM SO THAT GIVEN THE SCALE OF AGRICULTURE. I EVEN IF YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES YOUR CASH FLOW YEAH IT IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE LARGER THAN A SMALL RETAILER OR SOMETHING IN A DOWNTOWN. ENVIRONMENT SO THE SCALE OF THE BUSINESSES IS REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CASH INJECTION TO MAKE AN IMPACT. THAT'S WHY WE WORK WITH THESE AMOUNTS- BUT OF COURSE WE NEED A BALANCED AGAINST THE FACT THAT THE STATE CAN'T- FULLY FIND ALL ALL POSSIBLE LOSSES. WELL YOU'RE IN LUCK BECAUSE THAT QUESTION TRIGGERED A QUESTION FROM VICE CHAIR NIELSEN. SURE YOU ARE TALKING TO A FORMER. AND THIS IS ALMOST INSULTING WHY BOTHER. THE DISPLACED AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND CROPS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY AT THE MINIMUM THE 80% OF CROPS NOT PLANTED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF WATER BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. HELLO INTERJECTED MOTHER THOUGHT. TO THAT EFFECT. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE ALMOST NOTHING TO EXPEDITE THE CONSTRUCTION OF SITES RESERVOIR WHICH WOULD PROVIDE WATER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC USE- TYPICALLY ENVIRONMENTAL AND AGRICULTURE SO YOU'RE IGNORING SUPPLY. BUT NOW IN THIS DROUGHT WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE SOON I DON'T SEE THIS ADMINISTRATION LOOKING FORWARD ANYWAY. AND THESE SMALL FARMS. CUTTING OFF THAT MUCH REVENUE DOESN'T JUST CUT OFF THAT REVENUE TO THE FARMER IT CUT OUT JOBS TO FORMER EMPLOYEES. IT CUTS OUT INCOME THAT WILL SUSTAIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES I WOULD SUBMIT TAKE THAT BACK TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUGGEST THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. I AND I JUST ONE OH SORRY YES PLEASE. BUDGET JUST GONNA KNOW THAT YES I CAN TAKE THOSE FROM INSPECTOR PROJECT THAT. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA ADD THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE FARMS THAT ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES. INCLUDING THE DROUGHT BUT ALSO WITH ADDITIONAL ISSUES TO AND SO I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME SMALL FARMS THAT AID MAKE NOT BE IN SACRAMENTO OR IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT ARE DEALING WITH OTHER ISSUES. THAT WOULD ALSO BE REALLY DESIROUS OF HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR GRANTS SO. ON THE SECOND THING IS. THE- MOVING INTO I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME- I'M GONNA JUMP TO THIS- TAXPAYER FLEXIBILITY PAYMENT PROGRAM- THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADMINISTER- AND I'VE IF I RECALL WE ACTUALLY HAD A HEARING ON THIS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THIS- BEFORE AND WE HAD HEARD THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE PAST WAS NOT WORKING. AND SO VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU ALL DEFERRED TO MY COLLEAGUE- JEANNIE HERMAN IN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AFTER. GET AFTERNOON CHENEY HERMAN- FRANCHISE TOP FOR COULD YOU CLARIFY- FOR ME SO I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHAT WAS NOT WORKING. AND THEN I'LL JUMP INTO THE YES YES- OUTREACH CONNECTING TO LOWER INCOME FILERS AND NON FILERS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO APPLY THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET WHAT IS DUE TO THEM I'D RECALL WE HAD A LARGE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS WAS HIGHLY INEFFECTIVE. AND SO NOW THIS PROPOSAL IS ASKING FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL HOPEFULLY NOT BE THAT. LIKE A LITTLE CLARITY. BUT IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT CLARITY VERY HELPFUL SO THAT PAYMENT BUT TO PROGRAM IT IS IT IS COSTED OUT THIRTY MILLION AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT'S PRESENTED. SO THIS IS- A PROGRAM THAT'S REACHING OUT AND OR IMPACTING ABOUT AN ESTIMATED THREE MILLION TAXPAYERS. SO AND NOT AS WINDY INTO THE INCREASED COSTS THAT YOU'RE SEEN SO NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE TAXPAYERS- HAVE PAID THEIR DEBTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE- PENALTIES. FEES AND INTEREST THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO WAIVER AND FTP. WILL BE ISSUING REFUNDS AUTOMATICALLY THIS TAXPAYERS SO THAT REALLY WON'T BE ANY OUT REACH OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE GETTING- SOME FORM OF NOTIFICATION AND A DEBIT CARD OR A CHECK. OR A DIRECT DEPOSIT INTO THEIR- BANK ACCOUNTS WITH THIS. SOME OF THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO CALL AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED HOW TO CALCULATE THE SIX OTHER. AND SUCH WITH THE STOCK BECAUSE FOR. AND THEN THE OTHER NO INTO. ARE TYPICALLY GOING TO BE THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY. INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT FOR SOME SORT OF A COLLECTION ACTIVITY BUT OTHERWISE HAVE A DEBT IN EXISTENCE WITH THE FRANCHISE TALKSPORT. DOT WE'RE GOING TO NEED ENGAGE A TO ENGAGE IN ONE ON ONE WITH THEM ONCE THEY CONTACT US TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FULLY PAY- POLICE SAY THAT TAX DEBT OVER THE YEAR PERIOD WHICH IS THE- THE REASON THIS PROGRAM IS IN EXISTENCE AND ALLOWING FOR THE BASEMENT OF THOSE OTHER COST. SO YOU'RE ALSO REFERRING TO ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU WHICH IS THE OUT REACH FULL TO THE KELLY AGENCY GRANTS I'M SORRY TAXPAYERS AND IT IS ASSUMING THAT OF SHOULD BE WILL REACH OUT TO YOU I GET ABOUT TWO MILLION TAXPAYERS. SOME THAT ARE FILED WITH US BUT NOT CLAIM THE EITC CREDIT AND OTHERS THAT HAVE NOT FILED WITH US BUT pINFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT- YOU ARE CORRECT WE NEED TO SHOW THAT CONCERN WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION NOT JUST WHAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OUT REACH. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION- IT MANY ENTITIES THE IRS- OTHER STATE ENTITIES OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS THAT REACH OUT TO THESE FOLKS TO TRY TO GET THEM ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR. THE RESPONSE RATE IS FAIRLY LOW SO WE'VE ESTIMATED ABOUT A 5% RESPONSE RATE- FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS OF THE TEN MILLION WE WOULD EXPECT MAYBE A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ACTUALLY COME IN. AND TAKE US UP ON- AN OFFER TO WORK TOGETHER TO EITHER GET IT RETURNED FALL FOR THE FIRST TIME OR TO RESPOND WITH AN AMENDED RETURN SO THAT YET- AND MADE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS BACK INTO THE- THEIR HANDS SO THAT THEY CAN- COVER SOME EXPENSES. THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE. SO WHAT HAPPENS TO AN IN. WHO IS CURRENT ON A PAYMENT PROGRAM. SECOND QUESTION THANKS FOR THAT SO- IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON AN INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT WITH FRENCH OR SOMETHING FOR THEM TO AND THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND THE PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY PLAN. THEN IF THEY ARE ON A PAYMENT PLAN THAT- IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO A YEAR OKAY JUST KEEP ON CARRYING ON ALL THINGS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE IT'S GOING TO UPDATE. THE RELEVANT INTEREST PENALTIES AND FEES AND THEN THEY WILL SUCCESSFULLY PAY OFF THEIR DEBT ASSUMING THEY CONTINUE ON AS THEIR AGREEMENT INDICATES THEY WELL- IF THIRD INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT WITH A SIXTY THREE YEAR PERIOD- FOR EXAMPLE FOR TWO MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS- TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO NEED TO REACH OUT TO US- AT THEIR DISCRETION. IN ORDER TO RENEGOTIATE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AFFORD- THAT ACCELERATION OF THE PAYMENTS. SO THROUGHOUT THE COURSE. OF THE PROGRAM WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR. TO BE ABLE BE SENDING ABOUT THREE NOTE TO THE CENTRE. TELLING THEM ABOUT THE PROGRAM TELLING THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROGRAM WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP- THEMSELVES HOW THEY CAN REACH OUT TO US SO THAT WE CAN GET GOING ON- EITHER A MODIFICATION TO THEIR INSTALLMENT ARRANGEMENT OR EVEN BETTER YET PERHAPS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIRST TIME AND SMALLER RANGE RIGHT. AS WELL COSTS FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE ROUGHLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS- EVEN THOUGH THE PROGRAM RESULTS IN ABOUT ONLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION AND FIND FEE FORGIVENESS. SO YES SO THE COSTS OVER THREE YEARS ONE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE PROGRAM AT THIS POINT OVERLAPS TWO FISCAL YEARS- AND THERE'S GOING TO BE- RAMPING UP AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE RAMPING DOWN AND SOME. REMAIN TO WORK ASSOCIATED WITH DOCTORS REGIONAL PLUS PROGRAM SAYING HEY I MISS IT OR WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO NOW THAT WILL BE ABLE TO NEED TO ADDRESS SO. THERE IS A THREE YEAR PERIOD- THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO COVER TO MAKE SURE THAT RESOURCES BUT YOU CAN SEE BASED ON THE PROPOSAL THAT COSTS ARE SEVERELY- OR SIGNIFICANTLY SKEWS ME LASSEN NOT THIRD YEAR. THEN THEY ARE IN ON THE FIRST YEAR FOR SURE IN THE SECOND ADDITIONALLY ENOUGH THIRD HERE THERE IS SOME WORK LEFT TO BE HOT SINCE THE LATE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THIS PROGRAM. IN THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR SO SOME OF THOSE COSTS PARTICULARLY FOR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS IN YEAR THREE ARE DOING NOT WORK THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT IT ON HOLD BUT IT IS WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO THE ADDITIONAL STUFF FOR THOUGHT AND THAT DOES SUPPORT THE FULL PROGRAM OVER THE LIFE WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION- ELIMINATION OF FEES. PENALTIES AND INTEREST TEMPORARY TAPPED OUT OF THIS SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. SO WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION LIKE TO PRESENT. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE AND YOUR MARCH OUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'LL BE WRITING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE- THE MAY REVISION- HOUSING HOMELESS THE PROPOSAL. SO OVERALL THE MAYORS AND REPRESENTS A ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND INCREASE FROM THE GOVERNOR PROJECT PROBABLY AN HOMELESSNESS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD- SPECIFICALLY FOR HOUSING. AND THEIR VISION INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER TWO YEARS FOR ADAPTIVE REUSE TO CONVERT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER UTILIZE RETAIL. AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR HOW MUCH THAT THE MAYOR HAS BEEN INCLUDED UNDER FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR. FOR ADDITIONAL HOME KEY GRANTS BRINGING THE TOTAL HUNKY FUNDING TO THREE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION SINCE THE. BEGAN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ADDITIONAL VERIFY HUNDRED NINE ONE TIME. FUND OVER TO YEARS TO HOUSE UNTIL THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN CAMP ON STATE OWNED LAND. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR INTER OUSING AND BANCORPORATION ON STATE LOCAL OR PRIVATE LAND. LEAVING FROM HOUSING PLACEMENTS WILL PROVIDE BRIDGE HOUSING FOR UNSHELTERED INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BE TRANSITIONED INTO LONG TERM HOUSING PLACE. ADDITIONALLY THE MAYOR VERSION INCLUDES TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. FOR THE ESTIMATED COST TO REPAIR THE GENERAL FUND COSTS ALONE WHICH IS AUTHORIZED IN SB ONE FIFTEEN AFTER ELIGIBLE STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM APPLICATION. THAT WERE RECEIVED BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WELL ACTUALLY AFTER THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THE MAYOR IS AN INCLUDES SEVERAL- AYE. THE PROPOSAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO CREATE A COMMUNITY CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND CONCILIATION TEAM. IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE CONCILIATION SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY HATE INCIDENTS OR OTHER DISCRIMINATION. ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES FOR THAT COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE AS IF THAT WAS BY AB ONE ONE ONE TWO SIX IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND ADDITIONALLY AND LASTLY- THE MAYOR WAS IN PROPOSES STATUTORY CHANGES TO RENAME THE AT THE AGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS APARTMENT TO BETTER REFLECT THE DEPARTMENT EXISTING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M ALSO JOINED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ETT HI FI H. AND IF YOU. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MR MARC NOW WE HERE FROM L. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON SANDERS I'M NEW TO THIS ONE ON THIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE NEW REMISSION PROPOSAL IS THE NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES WELL CONTINUED STATE FUNDING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS A REASONABLE GIVEN THE SCALE OF THESE CHALLENGES IN THE STATE. THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO KEEP PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES IMPROVE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION IN PARTICULAR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ITS JANUARY PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A DOCTOR MAY USE PROGRAM WITH AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION. OVER THREE YEARS. FURTHERMORE THE MAY REVISION WAS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR THE INCOME HOUSING ON STATE OWNED LAND THIS IN ADDITION TO THE STATE ACCESS I PROPOSAL FROM JANUARY WHICH OPPOSES ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS FOR PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON STATE LAND. IN BOTH CASES MAKING EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS HOME HE IN THE STATE LANDS PROGRAMS MORE FLEXIBLE COULD ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL REDUCING THE NEED TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE MEROVINGIAN PROPOSES FUNDING FOR STATE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS UNDER. THE FILE THE LEGISLATURE COULD INSTEAD APPROPRIATE ALL OF THE FUNDS THIS YEAR YOU WILL FIND FOR X. COLLUDED. HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PURPOSES. ARE YOU THIS WAY TO LET- THE STATE CUT TO LABOR ITS DESIRE TO OF FUN TOWARDS. WHILE ALLOW. THE STATE TO SORT OF READ BENEFITS OVERRULED YEARS. I'M MORE OVER- MOREOVER SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO THE MOUNTING SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY IS APPROACHING THE PEAK OF ITS CURRENT EXPANSION EXPANSIONARY CYCLE. ELAINE INFUSION OF THESE FISCAL RESOURCES TO WIN CONDITIONS MAYBE HAVE SOFTENED COULD ENHANCE THE BENEFITS OF THESE ON IF YOU'RE NOT FUNDS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. FINALLY DEUTSCHE FOR ANY AUTHORIZED HOUSING HOMELESSNESS FUNDING SECOND THE LEGISLATURE SPEC CLEAR EXPECTATIONS AND ESTABLISH METRICS TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE THIS WOULD HELP FACILITY OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE'S PROGRESS TOWARD ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. AND DEVELOPING HOUSING THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW ITEM. LIKE TO BRING IT TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR NIELSEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. HERE YET AGAIN. IS A- MISSION AGREED JUST SO MISSION OF THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. ALL THE DESCRIPTION OVER THE DECADES HAS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SHELTER. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. BUT ALMOST NEVER DO I HEAR ANY DISCUSSION OF HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT INDUCE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THIS HOMELESS POPULATION. THEY HAVE NEEDS AND WHEN YOU ARE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR SHELTER. I'M ASKING YOU THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THE COURT NEEDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS SOME NEED TREATMENT OF MANY SORTS ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT. SOME HAVE THE HEALTH NEEDS ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT. ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PROVIDING SHELTER AND DIFFERENT MEANS TO DO THAT I COMPLIMENT YOU ON THAT BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S AN EGREGIOUS LEFT OUT NOW MAYBE YOU CAN SAY ALL THE OTHER% AGENCY OTHER AGENCIES ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT FIND THAT CONNECT THEM FOR US SO WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING THERE THAT INDIVIDUALS IN THESE HOMELESS ENCLAVES. THAT ARE BEING ASSESSED IN SOME MANNER I'M TALKING ABOUT I E. PIECE INDIVIDUAL LED THE EDUCATION PLANS IN EDUCATION YOU CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT HERE BUT THE INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS PEOPLE INDIVIDUALS BE SURVEYED AND THEIR NEEDS ASSESSED AND THEY BE DIRECTED TO AS YOU PROVIDE HOUSING BE DIRECTED TO SOME KINDS OF FACILITIES OR ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE OTHER MORE IMPORTANT NEEDS THAN JUST SHELTER. CAN SOMEONE TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT JUST A BIT. I'M CHRIS HILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FEEL THAT QUESTION- THE YOUNG. THE PROPOSAL'S MINISTRATION WORKING OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS TO HELP TREATMENT COMPONENTS AND BALL AROUND APERAM FOR EXAMPLE GIVES MONEY TO LOCALS FOR WRITING EVERY PURPOSES AND THAT CAN INCLUDE A COMPONENT TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE LOOK. SERVICES IN THE CARE THEY NEED ON ONGOING BASIS NOT JUST HOUSING ON THE ACCOUNTS PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE ON BOTH ON THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED BUDGET YEAR IN THE COMPONENT WE HAVE A CAREER. THAT'S ALSO COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL THAT FINDS PEOPLE IN NEED AND PROVIDE SOME SHELTER IN AN ONGOING SERVICES AS WELL IN THE MINISTRATIONS ALSO SPONSORING YOUNG THE CHARACTER OR PROPOSAL WHICH IS GOING TO ALSO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO PARTICULARLY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE NON. TARGETED ASSISTANCE UNDER OF. HI PLAN. AND ALSO TO- CANCEL FIND SHELTER FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL SO WE ARE HARD TO THE NEED FOR BOTH CARE AND SHELTER AND I'M MORE PROPOSED OUR ONGOING PROPOSALS AND OUR PROPOSED PROPOSALS ONGOING PROGRAMS OR PROPOSALS ALL SEEKS TO. ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS WELL MOST OF THESE NEEDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOT STATE GOVERNMENT SO WILL MONIES BE DIRECTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THESE PURPOSES IN THESE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW SIR. YES THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL GRANT FROM THE STATE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW THE LOCALS ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WERE WRITING CARE OKAY- IF YOU'D BE SO KIND THE TO GET A RECITATION OF THE THOSE THE ASSERTION TO JUST GIVEN ME SO WE CAN LOOK INTO A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH BECAUSE IF THEY'RE LOST IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO FOCUS ON A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU S. ROTH BEAT MY HAND UP BUT I DO HAVE A- I JUST WANT TO GET SOME CLARITY AND READING THE ANALYSIS THAT INDICATES THE- INSPIRATIONS COMMITTEE DO X. EXTENDING HAPPENED CURRENT LEVELS FOR ADDITIONAL YEARS BEYOND TWENTY THREE. I MEAN DO I READ THAT TO SUGGESTED OF COURSE GIVEN. AN APPROPRIATE CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN YEARS BEYOND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. YES WE ARE COMMITTED TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO- LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF FUNDING- HELP ON ON GOING BASIS AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS- SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OF COURSE BUT NOW I'M- LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY PROVIDING. RESOURCES BEYOND THE- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS HOME HEATING WHICH JOHN HAS A- OKAY GOOGLE THE SHELTERS AND THEN THERE'S AN ONGOING NEED TO FOR A LAUGH BUT HERE. IN SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE AND DOES. NOT HOUSING SO LOOKING AT WAYS TO LEVERAGE ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE HOW FUNDING TO MEET ONGOING NEEDS. SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION LEGISLATURE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE COURT PROPOSAL- IS FAIRLY RECENT AND THESE OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN. ONGOING ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME FUNDING AUGMENTATION MAYBE I'VE MISSED IT IS THERE ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC CARE COURT FUNDING PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH HOUSING ISSUES AND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROGRAM- ASSUMING THE PROBABILITY THAT THE OTHER HOUSING MONEY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS ROLLED OUT. HAS SORT OF BEEN COMMITTED. ENCUMBERED WHATEVER BY OTHER HOUSING NEEDS IN THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IF THAT QUESTION MAKES SENSE. THE ON- THERE ARE NO FUNDS PROPOSED IN THE REVISION CARE CORK AIRPORT IS- OF PUZZLES THE LEGISLATION IS GOING TO BE A POLICY THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK THAT- ONCE I CAN. I DIDN'T SPEAK THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME FUNDING TO POST IN OUR- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREA- I DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR COUNTY FRONT OF ME- BUT- THERE'S ALSO SOMEBODY PROPOSING JUDICIARY BUDGET ON BOTH OF THE COR CAR. THE ON FOUR SO. STAR UP COSTS FOR THE PROGRAM CREDIT DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE US OUTSIDE OF MY UNITS POLICY AREA BUT- SO THIS IS THE SENATE FRAMEWORK YOUR COURT AND ON THE ONGOING COSTS. THE TERM AND- YOU KNOW ONCE THE FRIEND OF THE PROGRAM'S LEGISLATION SPOUSES. PROGRAMS PUT INTO PLACE RIGHT AND I LISTEN I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS AND- AND AS I RECALL AND I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFICS EITHER THERE WAS A THIRTY SOMETHING MILLION DOLLARS IN THE- REVISION FOR THE COURT SYSTEM FOR CARE COURT AS I RECALL IF I'M CORRECT. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME WERE SOME OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WERE DEALT WITH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET BUDGET THE ONLY REASON I MENTION IT. IS CARE CORD IS REFERENCED IN OUR ANALYSIS UNDER. THE UNDER THE HELP PROGRAM. IF MY POINT IS THIS. THERE'S SOME HOUSING COMPONENTS OF THE CARE COURT PROGRAM AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE HOUSING COMPONENTS SEPARATELY FROM THESE OTHER. THESE OTHER HOUSING- ELEMENTS. THEY WERE DEALING WITH TODAY UNDER THIS ITEM ZERO FIVE ONE FIVE. AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO GO BEYOND THE EXISTING FUNDING LEVELS IN THESE OTHER PROGRAMS JUST BECAUSE THE NEED IS GREAT AND WE'RE ADDING. ADDITIONAL NEED WITH THE CARE COURT PROGRAM. SO I. THINK THAT'S ALL I NEED TO SAY MANAGER THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR HELP IN YOUR RESPONSE OR- THANK YOU SENATOR OUT OF EUROPE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- SO LET ME LET ME JUST- START- YOU KNOW WHO THE PUBLIC WHAT THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IT IT'S BEEN HOUSING FOR MANY YEARS- AND- MMHM. IT'S ALMOST UNIVERSAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND THE LACK OF HOUSING IS A CRITICAL ISSUE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THAT WE'VE HAD ON HOUSING BUT BUT I ALSO ANA I'M I'M I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT- BEST PRACTICES I THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT- AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE ABOUT UNIT REPRESENTING SIX COUNTIES I GOT A CALL SIX COUNTIES AND FIND OUT WHAT WHAT THEY DID WITH THEIR HAPPEN THERE HE FINDS AND- AND IT IT'S DIFFERENT AND I WONDER IF WE HAVE SOME MODELS OUT THERE THAT THAT ARE ARE MORE EFFICIENT MORE EFFECTIVE IN REALLY ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET SO I'M WONDERING IF WE HAVE- WE STARTED TO ASK FOR SOME SOME DATA BUT- BUT I'M WONDERING IF WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT EVALUATES THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM'S AND MIGHT CONCERN IS THAT- WE HEARD A BILL RECENTLY ABOUT THE HOUSING FIRST PROGRAM. TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THAT AND I THINK THERE'S SOME THERE MAY BE SOME INTEREST LONG TERM TO LOOKING AT OTHER STRATEGIES AND OTHER MODELS THAT- THAT THAT CAN WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOUSING FIRST BUT I'M WONDERING FIRST OF ALL DO WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT AND I'M LOOKING AT THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH IS A HALF BROTHER TO CONTINUE FINDING IT WHICH I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO DO- DO WE HAVE IS AB AB SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND- AND IS THERE. YES THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EVERY THAT THERE IS IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS THESE ARE STATE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING USED THIS QUITE FRANKLY WHEN I HEAR ABOUT A ROLL OUT OF THE PROGRAM THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY SAID SAY HEY WE DID A GREAT JOB PUTTING THIS PROGRAM TOGETHER AND THEN THEY FORGET THAT WERE PARTNERS IN IT SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A WAY I MEAN THAT'S IT'S- IT'S SELF SERVING IN MANY WAYS BUT IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT. THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOT TO GIVE US DATA AND INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE WHETHER FUNDS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE WHERE WHERE THEY MEET WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. YES THERE ARE THERE ARE DATA REPORTING ELEMENTS REQUIRED FOR ACCOUNTS- LOCALS- CITIES AND COUNTIES YOU CAN USE. CONTINUES OF CARE THEY UPLOAD DATA REGULARLY TO THE- CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS ISSUE- BUT BUT HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE SO NEW THAT- THERE ARE NOT ANY. REPORTS YET OUT THERE- THAT HAVE OUTCOMES- WERE. NASCENT STAGES OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SAME WITH ON CAMPUS SO- WE'RE WE'RE DEVELOPING A DOUBT EVER GETTING DOWN ON DOWN WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION ON ON- OUTCOMES KELLY C. H. WE'D ALL BE NOW BUT WE DON'T THIS EARLY STAGE HAPPENING YEAH. WELL I HAVE PROGRAM IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S FAIRLY NEW BECAUSE WE I KEEP FIRST RIGHT AND THEN HE PROGRAM- WAS AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY I KIND OF FEEL LIKE HAPPY AS THE OUTGROWTH OF HEAPING MAYBE MAYBE THAT. THE DETAILS WERE DIFFERENT SO MAYBE I'M NOT BEING FAIR ABOUT THAT BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT SINCE I RETURNED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE MADE HOUSING A PRIORITY WHEN THESE THREE OR FOUR YEARS NOW- I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA WHEN I ASK FOR IT LOCALLY IT'S VERY. VERY HARD TO GET AND I'M I WORRY THAT WE'RE RECYCLING PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING THEM PERMANENTLY OFF THE STREETS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM ISN'T SEEM TO GET. TO GET BETTER IN SO I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA OR A LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD AND- TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THAT BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT- AS MUCH MONEY AS WE'RE SPENDING ON THIS ISSUE- AP. I HATE TO RELY ON VIGNETTE STORIES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TELL US WHETHER WE'RE DOING WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO TO. MAKE A DENT IN THE PROBLEM AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S- IT'S SOME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DISTINCT ISSUES IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER BUT I DO THINK THAT. THAT- THERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE IF IT IF FOR PURCHASING PROPERTIES TO BE ABLE TO HOME HOUSE THE HOMELESS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROPERTIES CAN BE MAINTAINED AND THAT THEY CAN BE- THAT THEIR SECURED IN A WAY THAT THAT. IT STAYS. BUT PROPERTY AND IT DOESN'T GO INTO THE HANDS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS THAT USE STATE FUNDS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. TO BUILD SOMETHING AND THEN NOT REALLY KEEP IT. IN THE PUBLIC. DOMAIN AND THAT. AS WE GET MORE SOPHISTICATED ABOUT HOW WE- HELP PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE STREETS THAT THERE'S A WAY FOR THEM TO STAY. OFF THE STREETS SO THAT WITH WITH ENDED DON'T TURN AROUND AND DO IT SACRAMENTO DID RECENTLY WHICH IS THEY SAID HEY WE'RE CLOSING THIS UP WE CAN NO LONGER MAINTAIN IT AND- PEOPLE WERE BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN SO THAT I GUESS THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN ABOUT THE EVALUATION AND MAKING SURE WE'VE GOT THAT. CONDITIONS IN PLACE TO MAIN TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY THEN THAT IS BEING SPENT ON THESE. CONVERSIONS OF MOTELS. RESULT IN THEM BEING PART OF UP A PUBLIC. ASSET IF YOU WILL THAT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE HOMELESS THEY CAN BE OTHER INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND THOSE YOU KNOW SENIORS AND- I AM CONCERNED THAT WE MAINTAIN ALL OF THAT- SO THAT. MISPRISION CONCERNS AND THAT'S GREAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE COMMITTED TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LEVERAGING POSSIBLE ONGOING POSSIBLE LONGER TERM FUNDING SOURCES LIKE MAYBE HE CAN NOW HERE'S TO HELP THOSE UPPERS. EXTRACTS USING. THANK YOU FOR THAT I I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE MINISTRATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT CAUSED THAT I THINK WE CAN WE CAN TAG THAT FOR SOMETHING TO. MAYBE DO A HEARING ON SO WERE WERE WE ALL ARE. ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT ALSO- I REALLY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE RESOURCES IN THE- ADAPTIVE REUSE REUSE CATEGORY- COULD YOU TELL ME IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT- PRIORITY- FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP- OPPORTUNITIES IN IN IN THIS PARTICULAR FIND- WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT- I'M IT'S MY BELIEF THAT. THAT RE USING INFILL PROPERTY. IN IN AND IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BUILD HOUSING PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT CONDO- TYPE OF- STRUCTURES AND- IT'S- AT LEAST NOT IN MY MIND MORE PROBABLE THAT THOSE. PROPERTIES WOULD BE MEDIAN IT MEDIUM AND BELOW INCOME- IT'S A WAY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD EQUITY AND ASSETS AND START TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A REAL LACK OF. HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU IF YOU IF THAT PARTICULAR FUND WHICH IS A NEW FIND AS I UNDERSTAND IT- WOULD ENVISIONED. FOR SALE UNITS. I'LL TURN OVER MY HOUSING COLLEAGUES FOR A DOT BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT IS GENERALLY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I HAVE COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE- COLOR YOUR QUESTION. SENATOR UNCLES DID SHE GET THE CD. THERE'S NO- EXPLICIT- DIRECTION AROUND. FOR UP FOR SALE OR OWNERSHIP HOUSING EXCLUSION FOR THAT RIGHT SO HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE RIGHT OR WITH THE JURISDICTIONS YOU MAY ACCESS THIS FUNDING TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF INTERVENTION. THE ABOUT MAKING SURE WE CAN GET SOME BENEFIT. WILSON HOUSING IN THE PLACE USUAL IN FIRST. THAT IS GOING ON USED OR UNDERUTILIZED- AND REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT LIKE A DISTRESSED ASSETS AUTHOR COMMUNITY SO CERTAINLY IF WE HAD PROPOSALS THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE AND FOR SALE. OPTION THAT WE FIND IN OUR REGION- IT'S RESIDENTIAL USES THAT WERE LOOKING TO COME UP. VERY GOOD WELL I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- THAT TO THAT. SOME CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO FOR A HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THIS CATEGORY BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE- UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES- WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING PROP PROPERTY EXACTLY AS YOU SAID THAT IS UNDER UTILIZED AND CONVERTING IT INTO A POTENTIALLY MIXED USER OR CONDO KINDS OF. OF OF DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEIR FIRST UNIT WOULD BE- TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT THAT THE SENATE HAS HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES- THROUGH A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM TYPE OF DISCUSSION AND- LIKE TO THINK THAT MAYBE WE COULD. WE COULD ADD- ONE OF THE CAT SUBCATEGORIES IN THIS AREA FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AND MAYBE ENCOURAGE JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE THE EIGHTY IS ENCOURAGE- THAT THE PROGRAM TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT SO. THAT THAT THAT. THAT MIGHT BE A AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE JUST COULDN'T AVOID- WE COULDN'T TURN DOWN- AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THIS ALSO IS FOR EACH CD. IN REGARDS TO THE- BOTH OF THE- WELL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE BUDGET ARE THESE. THESE GRANTS THE HOMELESS HOUSING ON STATE OWNED. LAND AND THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO THE HOME KEY FUNDING PROGRAM ARE THOSE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE- A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE REASON THAT I'M ASKING IS THAT- IS IT MANY TIMES SOME OF THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A ROBUST STAFF TO DO GRANT WRITING HAVE A HARD TIME ACCESSING. HOUSING FUNDS AND SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR A DEVELOPER TO COME FORWARD IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- CRAFT AT- THE PROJECT AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU IF YOU- ONE HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT'S AVAILABLE OR TWO IF THERE'S A WAY FOR- FOR EIGHTEEN. PORTION OF THE GRANT TO GO DUE TO. COMMUNITIES THAT GENERALLY DON'T HAVE A HEART ARE GENERALLY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING FUNDS FOR HOUSING. SHURIKEN GET TO THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE GRANT PROGRAM HE PROPOSED PRINTER HOUSING IT IS DESIRED TO BE INCREASED TOUCH LOW- LOW REQUIREMENT IN TERMS OF STAFF WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL AND GETTING MONEY DOWN TO LOCAL TO HELP CREATE A MORE INNER OF HOUSING OPTIONS- AS THAT REACHED ALL THE PERMIT HOUSING GOT COMING ONLINE FEEL PREVIOUS YEARS INVESTMENTS. I WILL KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROBABLY YOUR MATES OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS YES FROM THE PREVIOUS HOUSING INVESTMENTS FROM THE PAST- HOUSING GOING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND OTHER SUCH WITH LEGISLATIVE LESLIE INVESTMENTS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS CONSTRUCTED WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CURRENTLY IN CONSTRUCTION. NO TWENTY K. PLUS A PENDING A CONSTRUCTION SO WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE THAT KIND OF CONTINUE ON WHILE WE WAIT FOR ALL THAT HOUSING TO BE BUILT IN THE STATE IS EXPECTED FROM EACH CITY FUNDED PROGRAM. THE NEW COUNT OTHER THINGS HAPPENING IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. IN THE TACKLES COURSE ALWAYS STRIVE DO THAT FOR A LITTLE GOVERNMENTS I KNOW THIS IS A NEW PROPOSALS HOW TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT IT'S- WORKS IS BEST I CAN FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT I KNOW THAT YOU CAN. MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO GET QUICKLY TO CREATE INNER OF HOPPING. HE'S. I THINK WE HAVE NOT MADE A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WE COULD GET RESERVE FUNDS. FOR VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE AND THEN OF COURSE OPENED UP FUNDS AND WE'VE BEEN PRETTY PRETTY ENCOURAGED BY. OF COURSE THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION WITH THIS YEAR'S FUNDING ROUNDS SO- HOPE THAT IT'S YOUR QUESTION PRO ON THE- SIDE PROGRAMS THE INTERIM. I'M HAPPY THAT WORK LIST. TO ENSURE THAT IT'S- FULL TO SPEAK THE THREE. AND LOOKING AT RESOURCES TO COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE WE CAN. SUPPORT HOURS AND FORTY. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT THAT- I GUESS THAT ACTOR WAS FROM IS THE SUBSCRIPTION OF GRANT GRANT. DO YOU REOPEN THE APPLICATION PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN TO GET NEW FUNDS OR DO YOU UTILIZE THE NEW FINES FOR THOSE THAT WERE NOT FUNDED DURING THE FIRST GRANT CYCLE BECAUSE THEY JUST WEREN'T READY AND I THAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT AGAIN GETS BACK TO THIS MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PASSED OVER. OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IF YOU KNOW THAT NEW FUNDS MAY HELP YOU FINALLY GET THERE- THAT THAT'S- WOULD GOOD NEWS TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO SOME OF MY COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM. EMBOLDENS COROLLA YOU SEE YOUR PRODUCTIVE USE AND FOR THOSE GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR HOUSING OR NEW PROGRAMS SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF- RESEARCHERS AND THEY'RE- YOUR SUBSCRIPTION- WAS SPEAKING TO WHAT'S ON HOKEY. SAID SO WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE DOING IT IS- KNOWING THAT. THIS YEAR'S CURRENT BUDGET AND- THAT WAS PASSED. YEAR HAVE TO. OF FUNDING SO WE WOULD BE ABLE HOUSING FUNDING AVAILABLE IN JULY WHEN WE ARE NOT FORCING FOLKS TO REAPPLY. WE AS LONG AS I. CURRENT APPLICATION IT. NEEDS THE PROGRAMMATIC RITUALS THEY WILL GET FUNDED MUTUAL. FUND UNTIL. THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO REAPPLY SO NOW WE- WILL. BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE- AWESOME. WHAT'S THE- PASTORS. THAT LAST YEAR- IN ADDITIONAL AND BELIEVE- ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MORE IN THIRTY SO WOULD WILL BUILD UPON THE CURRENT AND THEN WILL OUT THE NOTICE OF THE FIELD FOR THEIR FUNDS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SO I HAVE SENATOR. AND THEN. NIELSEN THANK CHURCH ONE OF FOR BEHIND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTER VALLEY WHEN WAS ASKING SOME ABOUT METRICS AND YOU KNOW IN THINKING ABOUT THAT I'M I'M JUST THIS I'M JUST CURIOUS- DO DO COMMUNITIES. AND THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT THEY SET OUT EXAMPLE IN THE IN THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY HAPPEN CAN'T WOULD RESOLUTION HOME KEY OPERATING SUSTAINABILITY COURT CARE COURT HOUSING SUPPORTS AND PROBABLY MANY OTHERS. ARE THESE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE THEY STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE BOARD AMONG COMMUNITIES OR- DO COMMUNITIES GENERALLY HAVE. A DIFFERENT ISSUES AND DIFFERENT HIGHEST PRIORITIES. AND IF THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED ACROSS COMMUNITIES WITH RESPECT FOR EXAMPLE HAP HOW DO WE DESIGN OF SYSTEM OF METRICS THAT MAKE SENSE. I MEAN I KNOW USED INDICATED YOU'RE COLLECTING DATA BUT HOW HOW DO YOU DESIGN A SYSTEM OF METRICS. A GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WINS LOSSES THAT MAKES SENSE. IF EACH COMMUNITY GETS TO SAID IT'S HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF CALLIE C. H. WORKS WITH THE VISION. I UNDERSTAND A KELLY C. H. WORKING EACH INDIVIDUAL HELP APPLICANTS TO STRUCTURE. RAMPS FUNDING- IN A WAY THAT BEST MEETS THEIR NEEDS AND- IF THEY ARE- YOU'RE NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT I WOULD DEFER TO THEM ON THAT PARTICULAR STYLE- I SEE SO. EACH INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IF AWARDED HAS A SET OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND THEN THE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES GRATED AGAINST THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE SET AT THE BEGINNING. HELLO THIS IS JULIE LOW KELLY C. H. I'M GONNA TRY MAN- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- IT'LL- LIKE THAT ON IT THIRD ROUND OF HALF THREE WHICH IS IN. PROCESS IN IMPLEMENTATION CURRENTLY THERE ARE COMMON COMPONENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT. ARE COMPRISED OF SOME SORT OF ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- SOME EVIDENCE AND DATA AND NARRATIVE AROUND HOW THOSE NEEDS WILL BE ADDRESSED AND ALT ALL HAVE GRANTEES. ARE REQUIRED TO SET GOALS AROUND SIX COMMON MEASURES THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO IS THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE- INDICATORS OF THE TYPE OF- TIONS HOME. THE TIMES FOR PEOPLE TO EXIT HOMELESSNESS INTO POSITIVE HOUSING SETTINGS AND AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT SORT OF USUALLY TELL US. AROUND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FULL SYSTEM SO EVERY JURISDICTION WILL HAVE SET GOALS THAT ARE TAILORED TO THEIR OWN. I'M RESOURCES AND NEED- BUT THERE ARE COMMON METRICS AS WELL AS COMMON COMPONENTS REQUIRED WHAT IS SPECIFIC TO EACH INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTION. IS A WILL VERY AND THE HAPPY IN THE CALAIS CH TEAM IS WORKING WITH EVERY GRANTEE TO DEVELOP THOSE APPLICATIONS AND THOSE GOALS. FOR THE RED. RIGHT THE REASON I ASK MICHAEL IS I'M LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS AND GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION I ASK ABOUT ONGOING FUNDING- AND A COMMITMENT TO EXTENDING THAT WHICH I UNDERSTAND THERE IS. THE ANALYSIS IS PENDING FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MEANINGFUL INCREASE OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON LOCAL HAP SPENDING AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AN IDEA WHAT SORT OF DISCUSSION WE NEED TO BE HAVING. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY IN IN RELATION TO THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURE SENTIMENT IMPLEMENTED AROUND HALF THREE WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. WE ARE EAGER TO- BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH A PERIOD SO THAT WE CAN REPORT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. OKAY WELL I GUESS THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE RESPONSE. SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MANAGER YOU KNOW OUR COMMITTEES ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE AGENCIES DO BUSINESS AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT SENATE HAS ACCEPTED. OF A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE IN H. TWO D. THE MAY REVISE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POSITIONS. PERMANENT POSITIONS THEY WERE ADMINISTRATIVELY CREATED. UNDER pWHAT ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO CREATE THAT MANY POSITIONS AND THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN P. WEISS AND TO OUR OVERALL STATE BUDGET. THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS BIG OF A REQUEST COMING INTO THE MAY REVISED IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE AGENCY WOULD BEEN WELL AWARE OF THIS AS THEY PROMULGATED THE BUDGET THROUGH THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR. IS THERE SOME REASON THAT THIS JUST POPPED IN RIGHT NOW. I'M JUST CURIOUS THIS IS MORE OF PROCEDURAL QUESTION WITHIN THE AGENCY ABOUT HOW YOU DO YOUR BUSINESS. AND IT SEEMS INTERESTING WHY THIS BIG REQUEST COMES IN AT THE MAY REVISION. SENATOR AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN- THIRTY HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POSITIONS WERE ADMINISTRATIVELY ESTABLISHED- IN THE CURRENT YEAR ON TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO IMPLEMENT FUNNY NOT WITH PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT IF YOUR CALL THERE'S AN IMMENSE INVESTMENT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND TO THE PHYSICIANS WERE PROVIDED WERE ADMINISTRATIVELY ESTABLISHED- USING THAT THAT ADMINISTRATORS SATISFIED EASILY THERE'S A 5% MINISTER. I AND WITHOUT FUNDING. AND- THESE PROGRAMS LAST FOR YEARS- TYPICALLY AND- THERE'S- A LONG TERM- AT THE MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS- SO. INTENSELY THE PHYSICIAN ARE SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE OF THE- THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUDGET LATE LAST YEAR- THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO BE INCLUDED- WHEN THE FUNDING WAS PASSED- SO THEY WERE ADMINISTRATOR LAY FABLESS AND IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT NOT TO INCLUDE THEM IN GOVERNOR BUDGET AND THEY WERE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE NOW- TO. TO HAVE THE SUGGESTED VERSION TO BE PERMANENTLY. ESTABLISHED THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU- GREAT QUESTIONS AT I HAVE A COUPLE SO WITH REGARDS TO THE HOMELESSNESS HOUSING ON STATE OWNED LAND THAT PROPOSAL. CURIOUS IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED THE STATE OWNED LAND IN QUESTION IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE HOMELESS THAT ARE. ON THE STATE LANDS- AND IF YOU CAN GIVE US A LITTLE CLARITY ON HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT. THERE IS A NO WIN THE DEPARTMENT HANDLE THAT QUESTION I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE A SHOT AT MYSELF- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S APPROXIMATELY CURRENTLY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS- WINNING ON STATE OWNED PROPERTIES STATE ON LANDS. YEAH ON THE- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE WAS JUST SOME OF SOME OF THOSE ARRIVED OUT BASED ON AVAILABLE FUNDS AND THEN- AND- THEN THE BUDGET PRIORITY. YES YEAH AND- NO MATHEMATICIAN TO PROVIDE A MORE SET OF SERVICES FOR PEOPLE THREE YEARS FOR INDIVIDUAL. UHHUH AND SO I MEAN LIKE WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE I MEAN I THIS IS THE SIMPLEST WAY TO ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PROGRAMS THAT WE- EITHER HAVE SUPPORTED THAT WE HAVE FUNDED THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED. TO FOCUS ON HOW WE MOVE FOLKS FROM BEING ON HOUSE TO HOUSE AND THEN THEIR ADS SO. WHAT IS IT CHRIS WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS THOSE. I THINK YEAH SO. MANY DEPARTMENT. BILL AS I MENTIONED RIGHT BUSINESS SUPPORTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- I BELIEVE YOU KNOW I WILL WORK FOR YOU ALL BUT I THINK THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF DEMANDING NEED A LOOKER REPORT IN TERMS OF IN RING HOUSING NEEDS OFTEN FOLKS AREN'T ENCAMPMENTS OR OR OR ON HOUSING WORKING AND SO KNOWING THAT WE'VE INVESTED QUITE A BIT INTO PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING WE'RE DOING. A LOT OF A HOME HERE WELL THAT'S COMING UP VERY VERY FAST THERE ARE STILL INTERNAL IN THE DARK GRANTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ORDER TO- FOLKS TO OTHER PARTS THEIR COMMUNITY NOT HAVE TO BE A STATE OWNED LAND FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE HOOK ON LAND WHO MEDIA PRIORITY BUT- TO MOVE IN WITH THEIR COMMUNITY AB RIGHT HERE OF HOUSING. TO ASSIST ME WHERE NECESSARY GOVERNMENTS AND HELPING. WITH AND SO THE COULD TAKE THE FORM- WHATEVER MAKES SENSE FOR THAT WILL COMMUNITY. BUT THIS IS THE GRANT STOP KIND OF COME IN FOR THAT INTERIMS. THAN LOOK AT REDUCING. WELL IT WOULD SEEM TO ME I KNOW KNOW THAT MY ABOUT. ALL OF THE BUT IT SEEM TO ME THAT IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO. CALL THIS DOLLAR AMOUNT INTO SOME OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING. AND ALLOW. THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK. TODAY IN. THE FEED INTO THAT RATHER THAN SORT OF. COMPARTMENTALIZE IN ALL OF THESE CHUNKS THESE BUCKETS OF DOLLARS. AND THEN HAVE FOLKS. HAVE TO CHASE BUCKET AFTER BUCKET AFTER BUCKET. BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE ALSO TO LEARN IS THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH BRAIDING THAT HAPPENS. THAT I MEAN WE WANT AND YOU KNOW THAT IT JUST WE END UP NOT BEING ABLE TO BE AS EFFICIENT WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK BECAUSE WE'VE CREATED ALL OF THESE SEPARATE BUCKETS. WHEN AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY HAVE IDEAS ABOUT WHERE FOLKS ARE WHO ARE AND HOUSE IN THE BEST WAYS TO GET THEM HOUSE. I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF SOLUTIONS. THAT DIFFERENT- JURISDICTIONS ARE- COMING UP WITH SO. I'M THE ADAPTIVE RE USE IS REALLY EXCITING- NEW PROGRAM- KIND OF QUESTIONING HOW MANY UNITS COULD THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING CREATED ME WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS. YEAH OTHERS SAY THEY SHOULD BE I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW MANY UNITS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENT SOMETIMES INFRASTRUCTURE SO- VERY SIMILAR TO PROBABLY FIFTY ARE REALLY. INTELLIGENT RESEARCHER GRANT PROGRAMS WE OFFER ASSISTANCE FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE PERMISSIBLE DETAILS. SO I THINK WE'RE HERE IS I TO- NOT READ ANYTHING CERTAINLY LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DISTRESS- DISTRUST ARE UNDER LESS PROPERTIES- IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW ME NOT. WE CAN IN TERMS OF HOW MANY UNITS IT WOULD CREATE I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TO REALLY HELLO- BECAUSE THESE WOULD BE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD BE TO HOUSING. TRANSFORMATIVE TYPE CATALYTIC THINGS WITHIN. OUR COMMUNITY BUT- WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS WE WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO MAKE. OKAY GREAT AND THE FINAL COMMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THE ADDITIONAL ADAPTIVE REUSE FUNDING YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS- VERY EXCITING- AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT A NUMBER OF CORRIDORS THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT- WHERE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR MIXED USE TO TURN LIGHT INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL. INTO USE- AND ALSO REALLY HOPING THAT THERE THAT. THIS IS- REALLY THOUGHTFUL- AND TARGETED BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF SCURRILOUS DEVELOPERS OUT THERE WHO WOULD SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU KNOW LARGE MONEY GRABS TO DO I AM. THIS KIND OF DEVELOPMENT I MEAN THERE WAS AN ARTICLE JUST IN THE PAPER I THINK LAST WEEK ABOUT A DEVELOPER IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY CHANGING THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE. OF A OF A NEIGHBORHOOD- AND THEY HAVE THE COULD THESE KINDS OF DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE- CAPACITY AND THE CAPITAL TO DO THIS BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONES WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AT HEART ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A REDESIGN OR BOLSTER OR INFUSE INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT MAKES SENSE THAT. DOUBLE IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GREAT IDEA AND I KNOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ADAPTIVE RE USE- FOR A LONG TIME AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHT GIVEN TO THIS AND GUARDRAILS ABOUT LIKE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO TARGET AND WHILE YOU'RE OUT OUTCOMES WHAT YOU WANT THE OUTCOMES TO LOOK LIKE. BECAUSE THIS COULD HAVE SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE RUSHING TO THE MICROPHONE SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO GENERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE ADMINISTRATION. WOOD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE TO PRESENT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BY ONE POINT IN THE FINANCE. A VISION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT PROPOSALS RELATED TO GENERAL COVER. UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THE MAIN VISION INCLUDES FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION ON GO GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FOR THE DIGITAL INNOVATION SERVICES REVOLVING FUND IS FOR THE REORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THE CALL DATA CLEAN.

THE OFFICE OF DATA INNOVATION WILL EXIST IN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY FOR BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THREE WILL BE ESTABLISHED VEHICLE VIA TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS A STANDALONE STATE DEPARTMENT BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WITH THE OFFICE PLANNING AND RESEARCH THE MALE VISION A- SEVENTY THREE ONE. DOLLAR YOU FIND ON GOING BEGINNING TWENTY TWO FOUR TWENTY FIVE DIVIDE CLINIC FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE. SCHOOL PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL WHAT OVER THREE THOUSAND FIVE HELLO ANNUALLY AS THEY TACKLE STATEWIDE SHALL. RANGING CLIMATE CHANGE THE FOOD IS READY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AFFAIRS THE MALE VISION TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS THE SUPPORT THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION WHILE IMPROVED LICENSING FEE MODEL IS DEVELOPED FOR USE BY LICENSEES. IN PLEDGING THE NAME OF ASIAN INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN BUDGET TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. IN AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TO SUPPORT THE COMPLETION OF THE BROADBAND MIDDLE MILE INITIATIVE. THE REFERENCE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDES TWEETS IN A QUARTER BILLION TO TWO POINT STATE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATEWIDE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. TO CONNECT ON CHILDREN I. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE POPULATIONS MADE EIGHTY HAS SINCE IDENTIFIED NEW MARKET HENSCHEL RESTS IN ANTICIPATED COSTS THOUGH OVERALL INCREASE THE COST OF THE PROJECT. THE AUDIT PASSED ME DOING WHAT I DO THANK. IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FIFTH FIVE NO ONE GENTLE FUND TWENTY TWENTY TO THREE. IN SIX HUNDRED SEVEN. AND FORTY ON GOING SUPPORT SHORT TERM IT PROJECTS APPROVED THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUNDING PROCESS HELLO COMMENDED BY CITY DESTABILIZATION SERVICES ASSESSMENT TEAM. FINALLY UNDEFEATED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THE MALE VERSION INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA VETERAN HEALTH INITIATIVE. THE COMMISSION FOR FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING VETERAN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS INCLUDING AN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. GRANTS TO VETERANS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN FUNDING FOR A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM RESEARCH VETERAN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. BACK INCLUDES FINANCES PRESENTATION ON THE SIGNIFICANT ENVISIONED PROPOSALS BUT I OF FINANCE COLLEAGUES INCLUDING STAFF JOINING US ON THE LINE TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THE WAY WITH THE SHIP. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN METZGER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I WILL PRESENT OUR COMMENTS ON FOUR PROPOSALS IN THE ORDER THEY ARE PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA. ON% THE GOVERNMENT OPERATION AGENCIES OFFICE OF DATA AND INNOVATION PROPOSAL. I IN GENERAL THE REORGANIZATION OF THE NEW ODI AS A STANDALONE ENTITY APPEARS READY TO CALL YOU. I'M GONNA GET OFF THIS AND CALL YOU- GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE. GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES HOWEVER WHETHER TO PROVIDE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FOR DATA AND INNOVATION SERVICES SHOULD BE WEIGHED AGAINST OTHER PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE ALSO PROPOSED ODI ACTIVITIES WILL REQUIRE COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING HELP PROJECTS BOTH IT AND NON IT YOU'RE HANDED OFF AND ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES. SO HOW FUNDS FOR DATA AND INNOVATION SERVICES IN THIS PROPOSAL AND FUNDS FOR SYSTEM STABLE GEN AND TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION IN CITY TEAMS PROPOSALS WORK TOGETHER COULD WARRANT SOME CLARIFICATION AND IN SOME CASES PRESCRIPTION AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO FOR EXAMPLE PLAN DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT MORE PROJECTS THAT QUALIFY AND SALAS. WHEN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IS CALIFORNIA COLLEGE COR PROGRAM PROPOSAL THE FIRST COHORT OF THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TO DEVELOP A LONG RANGE. STRATEGIC PLAN. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FUND BACK SO PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE ONE YEAR OF FUNDING IN REQUIRE THE BUREAU TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ITS PROGRESS. IN DEVELOPING A NEW FEE STRUCTURE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BUREAU REQUIRES ADDITIONAL TIME BEYOND ONE YEAR TO DEVELOP THE FEE STRUCTURE YOU COULD SEE FUTURE FUNDING BACK BILLS THAT THAT'S FINE. WHAT IS REASONABLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A NEW FEE STRUCTURE IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THAT PROCESS WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS. THIS APPROACH WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO RIP. REGULAR UPDATES ON THE PROGRESS OF DEVELOPING A NEW THREE D. STRUCTURE. AND FINALLY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THE PROPOSED ALLOCATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ARE INTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR INCREASED LABOR AND MATERIALS COSTS AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL MILES FOR THE STATE'S BROADBAND MIDDLE MILE INITIATIVE. HOWEVER THERE IS NO BUDGET YEAR APPROPRIATION THAT WOULD FUND OR PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CODIFY THESE ALLOCATIONS. FURTHERMORE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. WILL BE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF THIS FUNDING IN ITS PROPOSED REVISIONS TO A CONTROL SECTION TO ALLOW FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF FEDERAL FUNDING ONCE IT'S RECEIVED. AND OFFSET STATE BOND SUCH AS THOSE FOR. SORRY SUCH AS THOSE PURPLE HERE HIT NEEDED. THEREFORE THE LEGISLATURE COULD WAIT TO MAKE THIS DECISION NEXT YEAR WHEN MORE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED ABOUT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING IN BROADBAND MIDDLE MILE INITIATIVE CHANGES AND COSTS. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO BEFORE WE GO TO THAT ARE MY COLLEAGUES- WOULD AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND- I WITH- ANYONE ON THE LINE FROM THE COSMETOLOGY WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO. THE EARLIEST COMMENTS ON THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE PROJECT PLEASE DO SO. ABSOLUTELY MARTIN ROE- CALIFORNIA BERMAN TECHNOLOGY THE END OF THE THINK AS- DELEO IT IS LAID OUT IDEA ACTUALLY DESCRIBED. THE PROPOSAL OF WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THIS WE- YOU KNOW IT I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THROUGH TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT BUDGET IS IT'S ALL OPPORTUNITY THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE UNDER CONTRACT BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT TIME FRAME WATCH. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. OUR CURRENT PROCESS AND KNOW THAT THE PLAN IS TO HAVE KILLED BILL AS MUCH OF THIS IS. AND SO WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH HAVING CALTRANS DESIGN- AND- AND- DO THE PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK ON THIS PROJECT. AND THE CONCERNED WITH DELAY IN THIS FUNDING IS THAT. OF WHEN A CITY WORKS WITH CALTRANS AND GOLDEN STATE NATTEN OF UTILITIES COMMISSION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CALTRANS DESIGN. AND DEVELOP A PROJECT THAT IS SIZED TO THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. SO IF THE FUNDING ISN'T PROVIDED THIS YEAR THEN WE WOULD SIDES THE PROJECT- TO THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE. IF MONEY WERE PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE HERE- CALTRANS PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK IS ESTIMATED TO COST TO TAKE ABOUT TWO YEARS. AND SO- WITH ALL OF THE CONTRACT FUNDING NEEDING TO BE- SIGNED ALL THE CONTRACTS TO BE SIGNED BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- HUESO SUBSEQUENT YEAR TO GET FUNDING. I WOULDN'T. C. TIER CALTRAIN I'M TAX- DEVELOP A BROAD PROJECT SO THAT'S WHY REST FOR. THE FUNDING THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU ARRIVE TO DO ONE SINCE YOU QUEUING AT THE- LA- HAD A CUP OF- RESPOND. TO OUR COMMENTS TO THE PROPOSAL SO BEFORE I HAVE MY MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST GIVE YOUR FOLKS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE ON THE LINE FOR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH REGARDING THE COLLEGE SERVICE QUICKLY GRAHAM THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU'RE GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY OF ABOUT COUNT YET BUT COLLEGE. THAT'S RIGHT. COACH CORPORAL. GREAT DAY THANK YOU RYAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS JOSH FRIDAY WITH CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COME BEFORE YOU AND TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM- AND ALSO A CHANCE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. SO WE KNOW THAT THE COLLEGE COURSE IS A MODEL THAT WORKS THIS PROGRAM IS BASED ON A PILOT THAT WE'VE RUN. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH EIGHT UNIVERSITIES AND SEVERAL HUNDRED STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE ARE FACING UNPRECEDENTED DEBT WE'RE IN A DEBT CRISIS WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS MANY TO MANY STUDENTS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY GRADUATING ON TIME. THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE FACING A CHALLENGE WITH ENROLLMENT- IN BOTH RECRUITING STUDENTS AND ALSO KEEPING THEM AND ROLLED. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS ESPECIALLY OFTEN CAN'T AFFORD CAREER REACHING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE COLLEGE COURT PROVIDES WHICH GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO BUILD NETWORKS SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL CAPITAL ALSO TO BUILD PROFESSIONAL SKILLS. AND I AND ACCOMPLISHED WHAT UNIVERSITY LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE CALL HIGH IMPACT PRACTICES WHICH IS WHAT THE COLLEGE CORPORAL GRAHAM IS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE COLLEGE COURT ADDRESSES ALL THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING WHILE CREATING. A NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG LEADERS WHO ARE CIVIC MINDED- FOR CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE AND THEY'RE DOING IMPORTANT WORK THE SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY- RIGHT NOW AND WILL CONTINUE- DEBT THAT TO HELP VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WITH ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE ACTION SUPPORTING OUR FOOD BANKS TUTORING AND MENTORING OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ESPECIALLY AS WE COME OUT OF COVERAGE. AND SO THIS PROGRAM IS IN SO MANY WAYS OF A WIN ACROSS THE BOARD. IT WOULD. HE'S IN HIGH DEMAND NOT JUST ROOMS. TO WANT APPLY BE PART OF IT BUT ALL FROM UNIVERSITY YOU WANT PURCHASE A- AND SO FUNDING PERMANENT FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. IS NECESSARY TO ONE ENSURE THAT UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY PLAN AHEAD TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO SUPPORT STUDENTS TO SUPPORT. ANY AND I'M SURE ACCOUNTABILITY- WE KNOW FROM PROGRAMS LIKE THE PEACE CORPS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY OUR EXPERIENCE RUNNING AMERICORPS PROGRAMS AT THE STATE THAT WE CAN'T JUST SEND YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. TO DO WORK THAT RELLY EFFECTIVE IN TO MAKE IT A TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAM FOR THEM. AND THE SERVICE AND THE COMMUNITY THAT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN PROPERLY. BENEFITS NO THAT NEED TO GIVE STUDENTS A VAN. THE ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE TO BUILD IN OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS INTO THEIR DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO EVEN GO TO CALL IN THE FIRST PLACE WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD IT- AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE THIS PART OF THEIR PLAN. TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR COLLEGE WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IN A FOR ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO. PROVIDE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DREAMERS WHICH WE ARE DOING FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT AMERICORPS. PROGRAMS EXCLUDE DREAMERS BECAUSE IT'S FEDERALLY FUNDED SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO AND- AND INTEGRATE DREAMER GIVE THAT. LADY PARTICIPATE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME- THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED ONGOING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AND THAT FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM DEMONSTRATES. IN THE N. CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO BOTH DEBT FREE PATHWAYS AS RUDE AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANT CREE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY OF OUR LOW. YOU NEED WHAT ARE TOO OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM SO. HAPPY DANCE OR LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS AND HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK-YOU I'M AT. TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT I DO WANT TO SAY I DON'T. DE LA I WAS SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULDN'T HELP OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED. THEY JUST WOULD. IT DOESN'T OR ALTERNATE. I'M JUST BEFORE I HAVE MA'AM RISK I DO TO HAVE A GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESSENTIALLY DEFENDER PROPOSALS BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING FROM LA- THAT SAYING YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO SOMETHING MORE EFFICIENTLY- SO THAT'S JUST A YOU KNOW A PREP FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP BUT SENATOR NIELSEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS. WELL YES- CONFESSING THAT I KNOW A LOT OF HISTORY HERE AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. AND I'M GLAD THERE'S A GENTLEMAN HERE REPRESENTING THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. OVER THE DECADES SINCE THAT AGENCY HAS BEEN CREATED ITS GREATEST SUCCESS HAS BEEN CHANGED ITS NAME SEVERAL TIMES AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED NOW I GUESS IT'S OFFICE OPERATION THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THIS PARTICULAR. PROPOSAL IT IT'S SETTING UP A- DADDO AN INFORMATION STAND ALONE DEPARTMENT WHY CAN THIS NOT BE. JUST A PART OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NOW THE GO AHEAD TO THROW OME WORDS IN HERE IMPROVING USER EXPERIENCE THROUGH DIGITAL INNOVATION SERVICE OF ALL BEING FUNDED CENTER. I JUST DON'T SEE WHY THAT CAN'T BE HANDLED IN THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHAT WE HAVE TO CREATE A NEW. DEPARTMENT WITH ALL THE OVERHEAD OF MANAGEMENT THAT IS ENTAILED. OPERATION AND- BE WISE FOR THAT LET'S GET TO THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION WHY CAN'T THIS ALL BE HANDLED WITHIN THE EXISTING AGENCY. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN WE HAVE COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE FROM THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WHO WILL RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION. HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION MY NAME IS DR ON A CRIME THE US TEAM WHITE SHIFTED OFFICER AND- REPRESENTING CAL DATA THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MERGING. WITH OFFICE- THEY TO BE. ON THE PROPOSAL TO RENAME IT THE OFFICE OF DATA AND INNOVATION. AND THERE'S A SHORTEN A LONGER ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION- AND IT'S A- IT'S A IT'S A IT COMES FROM A POSITION OF- THE CHANGE THAT'S HAPPENING IN TECHNOLOGY SO ESSENTIALLY- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING FROM THE OFFICE OF DATA AND INNOVATION A LOT OF THE WORK WILL BE DOING WILL NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY OR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND IT'S A DIFFERENT SKILL SET AND A DIFFERENT SET OF BOOKS. SO EARLIER TODAY YOU ALL WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW LEAD MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE AND THE OF THE GRANTS PROGRAM AROUND SOME OF THE ON THE HOUSING HOMELESS WORK GREAT SO THE OFFICE OF DATA AND INFORMATION CAN BE A PARTNER AROUND SETTING STANDARDS ABOUT HOW DO WE MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE DELEGATE HER I. T. TEAMS ARE EIGHTY TEAMS MIGHT. HELP US COLLECT THE DATA AND SECURE STORAGE WE REALLY DOES. RELY ON THE BUSINESS SIDE. OF IN THE PROGRAM SO I TO REALLY TRULY USE THAT DATA TO OPERATE THOSE PROGRAMS EFFECTIVELY- IT'S KIND OF ANALOGOUS TO. WELL WE ALL USE SOFTWARE RIGHT- OF WRITER USES SOFTWARE ON TO WRITE A NOVEL- BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE'S A TECHNOLOGIST RATES OF THE SAME THING WHEN WE USE DATA AND WE DO SERVICE DESIGN AND DELIVERY WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A DIGITAL COMPONENT. IT'S A DIFFERENT SET OF SKILLS IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENGAGEMENT AND- AND WE ACTUALLY PULL AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS TO WORK ON THOSE PROBLEMS. LET ME THEN FOLLOW UP AND I CONSIDER THAT AN ADEQUATE ANSWER AND I THANK YOU. MAYBE THE GENTLEMAN FROM OR I. T. MAYBE CAN BETTER ADDRESS THIS ONE. THIS IS A FAR BROADER QUESTION AND KIND OF AN IMPATIENT CONCERN AREA OF MINE. IT'S JUST BEEN DISAPPOINTING OVER THE DECADES THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS STATE HAS EXPANDED. TO EMPLOY NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND ALMOST NONE OF THEM OF WORKED. THEY'VE ALL BEEN NOT ON TIME NEVER ON BUDGET. ALWAYS SICK CREDIBLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN INTENDED. FISCALE IS ONLY BUT THE MOST RECENT DISASTER. COULD SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THAT IS SO IN THIS STATE. SUPPOSEDLY THE I. T. CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. AND WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. I WOULD FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ON THAT QUESTION PLEASE THANK YOU. I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CAROLYN NORDSTROM AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE AND SO. IN THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PROJECT DELIVERY WE DO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OVER THE I. T. PORTFOLIOS AT. THE PORTFOLIO OF IT PROJECTS- WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF. NOTABLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE. EXCEEDED THEIR BUDGETS OR NOT BEEN DELIVERED AS EXPECTED- IT IS AN ACCURATE TO SAY THAT ALL OF THEM. ARE ALWAYS LATE AND ALWAYS OVER BUDGET THERE ARE ACTUALLY MANY MANY PROJECTS THAT GET DELIVERED EVERY YEAR THAT DO MEET EXPECTATIONS- OF DELIVERING THE BUSINESS VALUE THAT. IS INTENDED FOR THAT SEVERAL NOT SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PROJECT DELIVERY- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING PROVIDING THAT INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT AND HELPING TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE PROJECTS DO NOT MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND DO EXCEED THEIR BUDGETS SO THOSE INSTANCES ARE UNFORTUNATE AND GENERALLY THEY CAN BE HIGH PROFILE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE. IS FISCALE. WORKING NOW. FISCALE. I AM NOT THE EXPERT IN IT FOR SCALE I KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AND THAT PROJECT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY COMPLETED AT THIS TIME. I DON'T HAVE FURTHER SPECIFICS- THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS HERE TO TESTIFY ABOUT SO I WOULD. DEFER TO YOU KNOW ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS- LATER IF WE CAN COME BACK TO YOU ON THAT STATUS I WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH I'M NOT BEING OPTIONED AND I'M BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE THOUGH BECAUSE THIS IS A SITUATION THAT- THIS IS NOT SATISFACTORY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M GLAD THAT THERE ARE SOME AND I'M- PROBABLY A LITTLE HARSH AND SAYING ALL. BUT THAT SOME MAJOR ONES INCLUDING THIS ONE- HELP. ME AND- YEAH IT'S BEEN I'VE BEEN A PART OF IT WHEN I WAS HEAD OF THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS WE HAD THE- CORRECTIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES WHATEVER IT WAS CALLED. SHEAMUS I GUESS IN THE WHO SPENT YEARS AND. DOZENS OF STAFF DEPLOYED. CRASHED AND BURNED NEVER DELIVERED TELL THANK YOU FOR THE ATTEMPTING TO GET BACK. UNDERSTOOD WE WILL DO THAT THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR ROTH THE MANAGER FIRST- JUST TO FOLLOW ON MY QUESTIONS AND MY COLLEAGUE- HAS BEEN WITH ME IN. THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN DIFFERENT YEARS AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TERRORISTS DURING THE SUB COMMITTEE FOR SIX YEARS OF. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND SO. I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL OF THE VERY LARGE PROJECTS THAT- STARTED FRANKLY PRIOR TO MY TIME HERE AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY. ONE OR TWO OF THOSE LARGE PROJECTS OF. CONTINUE THE ARTICLE TO APPEAR IN THE NEWSPAPER AND THEY'VE NOT QUITE AT LEAST THE ONE NOT QUITE COME TO A TO CLOSURE ALTHOUGH IN THE CASE OF FISCAL THEY'RE GETTING THEIR THE TEAM THAT'S WORKING IT'S GETTING THERE AND I'VE I THINK YOU GIVEN THE SIZE THE SCOPE THE COMPLEXITY AND THE NUMBER OF BOARDS BUREAUS- IN THE LAKE THAT- THAT FALL UNDER D. C. A. N. AND I MEAN THAT B. C. A. BUT- THE CONTROLLER AND- THE PROPONENTS ABILITIES OF THE CONTROLLER I THINK IT'S- IT'S QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT TO. BRING THAT- BRING THAT PROGRAM TO WHERE IT IS THEY'VE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE WAY PROGRAMS OR SCOPE INCISED. OTHER BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE MY INITIAL TIME IN THE SUB COMMITTEE IN THE WAY THE PROJECT APPROVALS ARE HANDLED AND I THINK IT IS PROBABLY TRUE. THAT THERE ARE MANY PROJECTS THAT THAT THAT- ARE COMPLETED YEAR OVER YEAR THE DO NOT MAKE THE NEWSPAPER- BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK OF THE PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE HARD WORK OF THE PERSONAL PERSONNEL IN THE AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENTS- WHO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO ON BOARD NEW SYSTEMS AND I THINK WE NEED WE ARE TO GIVE THE FOLKS CREDIT FOR THE WORK THAT THEY- THEY ARE DOING AND CONTINUE TO DO IN THAT IN THAT AREA. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR STEPPING UP WITH RESPECT TO THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THIS IS AN AREA THAT I WORK IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY HERE IN THE SENATE IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE RATHER COMPLICATED ISSUE THE CHANGES IN THE- PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY ARENA- FRANKLY CALL FOR REVIEW OF THE- BUREAU'S OPERATIONS IN ITS REQUIRED FUNCTIONS TO DETERMINE THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED ON A GO FORWARD BASIS. I AM THE BEST METHOD FOR FUNDING. OF THOSE OPERATIONS THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME- AND I DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATORS BENEFICIAL SUPPORT AND PATIENCE. AS WE WALK THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO DETERMINE. BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR THE FUTURE SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT KUDOS TO THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR RON I AM. JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. OUT ONE WAS ABOUT THE M. FOR IT REGARDING THE- PROPOSAL. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THIS BROADBAND MIDDLE MILE INITIATIVE AND THE QUESTION JUST HAD TO DO WITH THE AMOUNT- BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S- A WANTED TO KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION COULD PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR DETAILS ON WHY THE COSTS HAVE INCREASED SO SIGNIFICANTLY. SURE SO THE UNIT IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL REALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT- IT KIND OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS PROJECT OVER THE LAST YEAR- SINCE- SB ONE FIFTY SIX WAS PASSED AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SEEN- OR YOU KNOW IS- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS DONE ITS ITS JOB IN TERMS OF- DEVELOPING MAPPING REALLY IDENTIFYING WHERE THAT. IN THE UNDERSERVED LOCATIONS WERE I'M AND THEN AS WE'VE GONE AHEAD AND WORK WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BUILDING STATING THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE RISK IF THERE MIGHT BE A NEED FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER- NETWORK AND STEPS THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE DRIVERS YOU KIND OF LOOK AT THE DRIVERS THAT WERE- AND IDENTIFIED BY THE ONLY. THING WITH THAT THE INFLATION- YOU KNOW SO I JUST EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT FOUR ONE HALF YEARS FROM THE TIME FROM NOW UNTIL WE FOR PROJECT- WITH THE PROJECT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT COULD EASILY BE IN THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION RANGE- JUST JUST IN TERMS OF INFLATION AND THEN IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE- THAT THE DEMAND ON- FOR RESOURCES IN FOR LABOR WHEN YOU LOOK AT- YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT COSTS RIGHT SO- THE COSTS THAT WERE ESTIMATED WORLD YOU KNOW FOR THE PRELIMINARY YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER- AND AS WE- CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE THESE ADDITIONAL RISKS AND SO. WE LOOKED AT KIND OF THAT THAT THE SCALE OF THOSE RESTS IN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE AND THEN DEVELOPED THIS THIS REQUEST FOR THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION SO THAT THAT'S REALLY- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ITEMIZED LIST IT'S REALLY AND I AM TRYING TO IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT ARE IN THE YOU KNOW HUNDRED MILLION RANGE EVER MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION AND A LOT OF CASES- AND TRYING TO- TO MITIGATE SOME. COMBINATION OF THOSE WITH THE ONE POINT. Q. I. AND THEN. OTHER QUESTION JUST TO DO THE ARE. OF DATA DIGITAL. AS A STATE. DEPARTMENT I WANT THANK YOU FOR- PROVIDING THE- CLARIFYING RESPONSE THAT YOU DID TO SENATOR NIELSEN THE IBM. BUT WAS JUST SORT OF CURIOUS ABOUT IS THIS LIKE- WOULD THIS BE A DATA SILO I MEAN DOES IT DOES IT WHY DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR TO BE A STANDALONE DEPARTMENT RATHER THAN TO. ALLOW THESE KINDS OF SUPPORTS OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- TO BE INTEGRATED INTO DEPARTMENTS ADD IS IT LIKE YOU- IF YOU'RE ONE DEPARTMENT DO YOU GO TO THIS DEPARTMENT WITH A TICKET TO SAY HEY I'M GETTING READY TO DO THIS PROJECT. CAN YOU HELP ME OR GIVE ME GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS BETTER OR IS THIS DEPARTMENT SORT OF DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW. DIFFERENT PROJECTS ARE BEING MANAGED- IMPLEMENTED WITHIN DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO OFFER THEM FEEDBACK. A. M. I DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT- THAT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION AND IT'S EXACTLY- AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS WHICH IS- A PHRASE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO BUILD CAPACITY NOT BE THE CAPACITY IN ORDER TO BUILD CAPACITY THAT WE NEED TO SET STANDARDS OF WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE AND ALL THESE THINGS WHETHER IT'S DATA SCIENCE DATA ANALYTICS. EVALUATION AND NOT- METRICS CREATIONS BUT ON SERVICE pADDITIONALLY- CONTENTS RIGHT ARE HOW ARE WE WRITING- CONTENT THAT IS READABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW OF MANY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND I LOVE IT YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIFTH GRADE GRAMMAR LEVEL RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE GOVERNMENT HE'S RIGHT AND THEY'LL BE MORE LESS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THESE KINDS OF CONCEPTS BY DEFINING.STANDARDS OF WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE. FOR CONSULT AND COACHING TO DEPARTMENTS AND HELPING BUILD THEIR- CAPACITY TO DO THIS THEMSELVES THROUGH THE CALIPARI WHICH WILL OPERATE THE STANDARDS AND TRAINING. AND THEN BE READY FOR THE DAY FUNDS- TO HELP CATALYZE PLANT PROJECTS AND SUPPLEMENT THEIR CAPACITY SO THEY CAN ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF THESE MODERN METHODS AND APPROACHES. FROM THE SOUNDS OF THAT THIS GROUP WOULD BE INCREDIBLY BUSY BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT AND HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE HAVING A BETTER. CHANCE THAT WAS FACETIOUS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA- MOVE ON TO THE LAST ITEM WHICH IS CANNABIS I A. K. A. COOL NOT TO MOVEMENT OVER HERE I DO WANT TO SAY- THAT IFORGOT TO ASK A QUESTION EARLY ON ABOUT THE TAX REBATE WITH THE CARS AND SO I'M JUST SAYING IT NOW SO IF ANYONE IS IN THE LIKE THE ZOOM Q. AND THEY DECIDED TO LEAVE. THEY SHOULD COME BACK AND I WILL TELEGRAPH THE QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE CARS THAT FAMILIES THAT HAVE INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTION- AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE A CAR AND WHERE DO THEY FIT IN IN THIS REBATE DISCUSSION SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT NOW SO THAT THE RIGHT PERSON CAN FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THE ZOOM AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT TO GIVE US AN ANSWER. SO WITH THAT CANNABIS CONTROL CANNABIS TAX REFORM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE TO GO CHARLIE MANNING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS RELATED TO CANNABIS. THE FIRST INCLUDE STATUTORY CHANGES. TO RESTRUCTURE THE CANNABIS TAX FRAMEWORK TO HELP STABILIZE THE CANNABIS RETAIL MARKET. MAJOR CHANGES INCLUDE SETTING THE CULTIVATION TAX RATE AT ZERO BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SHIFTING THE POINT OF COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE FOR EXCISE TAX FROM DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. MAINTAINING A FIFTEEN PERCENT EXCISE TAX. SETTING THE FUNDING FOR YOUTH EDUCATION INTERVENTION TREATMENT ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AND STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS AT A BASELINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THREE YEARS. WITH UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE AS NEEDED TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TO BACKFILL ALLOCATION THREE FUNDING ALONG WITH THE AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE EXCISE TAX RATE TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. IF TAX REVENUES FALL BELOW THE BASELINE FOR ALLOCATION THREE. ADDITIONALLY STRENGTHENING TAX ENFORCEMENT POLICIES TO INCREASE TAX COMPLIANCE COLLECTION AND REDUCE UNFAIR COMPETITION. THESE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THE TAX STRUCTURE AND HELP REDUCE BURDENS FOR LEGAL OPERATORS. THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CANNABIS LOCAL JURISDICTION RETAIL ACCESS GRANT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WAS THE CITIES AND COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY LICENSED STOREFRONT OR DELIVERY ONLY ONLY CANNABIS RETAILERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOCAL RETAIL LICENSING PROGRAM AND HELP MORE OF CALIFORNIANS EXISTING CONSUMERS GAIN ACCESS TO REGULATED AND TESTED PRODUCTS THE LICENSE LEGAL REASON. THERE'S COLLEAGUES AND I ARE FROM FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU NOW WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE L. A. R. THANK YOU. SIR FOR CHRISTINE WITH THE L. A. ONLY AT THE PROPOSALS TO MOVE THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX POINT OF COLLECTION AND TO ELIMINATE THE CULTIVATION TAX- THESE TWO PROPOSALS MATCH RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT AND NOW WE HAVE NO CONCERNS ON THOSE HE PROPOSED RATE CHANGES FOR THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX OR COMPLEX WHICH IS AN IDEAL BUT THE PROPOSAL CLEARLY IS TRYING TO STRIKE A CERTAIN BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY CANNABIS REVENUES ON ONE HAND AND HELP LICENSE CANNABIS MARKET COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET ON THE OTHER. THE LOCAL RETAIL GRANT- I LACKS DETAILS AN INTERVIEW APPEARS UNLIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE AS STRUCTURED SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING IT. THE PROPOSAL APPEARS TO ASSUME THAT A LACK OF FUNDING TO DEVELOP A LICENSING PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW RETAIL CANNABIS. I INTERVIEWED LIKELY THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW RETAIL CANNABIS PRIMARILY FOR OTHER REASONS AND SO THESE GRANTS AS STRUCTURED. WOULD NOT ADDRESS THOSE- THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED COMMENTS AND MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA PETERS AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY GREAT SO ONCE AGAIN BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THE COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO- THE L. A. O. HE SAID REJECT. SURE OF FOR THE TAX REFORM THE INTENTION OF THIS PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE A SUBSET OF BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY CANNABIS TAX REVENUES AND HELPING TO REDUCE BURDENS ON LEGAL OPERATORS THROUGH ELIMINATING THE CULTIVATION TAX AND SHIFTING THE POINT OF COLLECTION FOR EXCISE TAX FROM DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL. THE MECHANISMS TO CHANGE THE EXCISE TAX RATE IN THE EVENT THAT ALLOCATION THREE REVENUES DO NOT MEET THE BASELINE FUNDING ARE INTENDED TO BE SIMPLE FOR LICENSEES AS THEY WILL BE NOTIFIED OF ANY NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE ACCESS EXCISE TAX RATE MY NUMBER NUMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR CHANGES IN THE RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND BY NOVEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOR CHANGES IN THE RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO HELP THESE THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A LOCAL RETAIL LICENSING PROGRAM. THESE ENTITIES HAVE COST BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND MINISTRATION. THEY ALSO COST TO ESTABLISH AN ORDINANCE AND CONDUCTING SECRET. MY COLLEAGUES ON. THE LINE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL- IF THEY WANT TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OKAY GREAT I'M GONNA GO TO THE- TO SENATOR NIELSEN- FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TO ME THIS DEBATERS GOT AN ELEMENT OF ABSURDITY. NOW ADMITTEDLY I DID NOT SUPPORT LEGALIZATION. IT'S HERE. BUT NOW WE HAVE A HUGE MESS. THE ILLICIT MARKET IS DOMINATED. THE LEGAL MARKET IS SUFFERING. WAS THAT NOT TO BE EXPECTED OF COURSE IT WILL. OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND I DON'T FAULT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO DO NOT WANT. CANNABIS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES I SUPPORT THAT. BUT THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE ANSWER. IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME AND CONVINCE ME THAT LET'S DO A FEW THINGS ABOUT CRACKING DOWN ON THE ILLICIT MARKET. IT'S RAMPANT COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN THIS DESPOILING A LOT OF OUR WATERSHEDS. POISONING OUR GROUNDWATER. PREVENTING THREATS DIRECT READING PUBLIC. ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. AND IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION. NOT FOCUSING ON HELPING OUT THE LEGAL MARKET. LET'S DO WHAT WE CAN THERE BUT LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ILLICIT MARKET TO. IT'S A PLAGUE ON CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR ROTH VENTURE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE I THOUGHT ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WE HEARD SOMETIME BACK FROM FOLKS IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS ABOUT THE CANNABIS STRUCTURE THAT WE SET IN PLACE WAS THAT THE- THAT THE BURDEN THE LOAD THAT WE PLACE ON THEM. BOTH LOCALLY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL WAS CAUSING THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT TO BE SUCH THAT- THEY WERE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET. VIS A VIS THE- ILLEGAL MARKET. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE IMPACT OF THIS CANNABIS TAX REFORM PROPOSAL SO IF WE SET THE CULTIVATION TAX RATED ZERO BUT WE INCREASE THE EXCISE TAX TO NINETEEN PERCENT. WHAT WHAT IS THAT DO AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION YEAH. SENATOR NICOLE ELLIOTT FROM THE DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE TODAY- AND REGARDING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE NINETEEN PERCENT- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PARTNERS ON THE TAX REFORM PROPOSAL ENGAGED AND IN THIS HEARING AS WELL INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE 90% IS AN ISSUE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN ALSO SPEAK TO ONE THING I WILL NOTE THAT WITHIN US ALL IS THAT IT DOES SPEAK TO ME G. R. EXCISE TAX AT 15% FOR NO LESS THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. IN UP TO THREE YEARS I WITH THAT HE DID OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TALK MORE A LITTLE ABOUT THE 90% FRESH YOU JUST POST. GOOD AFTERNOON KIMBERLY HARBISON FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS DIRECTOR ELLIOT MENTIONED. OF THE 19% IS- DESIGNED TO DO. TWO THINGS REALLY WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE AS- THE ELLIE OKAY THE FAMILY NOTED. BETWEEN THE FUNDING FOR THE ALLOCATING THREE PROGRAMS THAT'S THE YOUTH EDUCATION TREATMENT PREVENTION AND- NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMPONENTS SO. WE'RE TRYING TO ASSESS OUR LEGAL PARTICIPANTS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESS TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE MARKET. THAT'S ONE WAY WE CAN COMBAT THE ILLICIT ACTIVITY. AND WE ALSO ARE TRYING TO BE MINDFUL OF. FUNDING FOR THOSE ALLOCATION THREE PROGRAM SO THAT THE CURRENT TAX RIGHT NOW. MOTIVATION IS ABOUT 4% AND EXCISES 15% SO TOGETHER THAT'S NINETEEN PERCENT. WERE ZEROING OUT THE CULTIVATION SO THAT LEAVES US AT 15% TO START THIS PROJECT. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND BACK CELLS SO THE IDEA IS. IF THE TAX RATE IS LOWER PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO BUY MORE CANNABIS OVER ALSO THE REVENUE WON'T DEBT. BECAUSE THE TAX RATE LOWERED IT WILL JUST SAY ABOUT THE SAME BECAUSE MORE CANNABIS WILL BE PURCHASED MORE TAX REVENUE WILL COME IN. IF THAT DOESN'T TURN OUT TO BE THE CASE WE CAN SUPPORT THEM THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. IF THAT STILL DOESN'T GET THEM TO THE BASELINE THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD. MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE EXCISE TAX RATES. AND THIS IS NICK WITH ARSENAL PRODUCT. ATTACKS IN TWO MINISTRATION I MAKE. I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S NOT-NECESSARILY ABOUT. SELLING MORE CANNABIS IT IS ABOUT. DRIVING ACTIVITY. INTO THE LEGAL MARKET. AND WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE TAX REFORM PROVISIONS HERE. WELL AS THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS WITH SHRINK WHICH INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. WILL ALLOW US TO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY- GRAPPLE WITH- THE ILLICIT MARKET I COMPLETELY SHARED CENTER NEILSON'S. CONCERNS AND- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN I THINK THIS PROPOSAL. WILL ALLOW US- THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS TO THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS AS WELL AS ALLOWING US TO. USE OUR SALES AND USE TAX OUR RESOURCES AND COMBINE THEM WITH OUR CAMPUS RESOURCES BECAUSE NOW. IT WOULD BE AT THE- RETAIL LEVEL SO THEY WOULD BOTH BE SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS AS WELL AS THE X. TAXPAYERS AS BY THE WAY. IS I MEAN THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED AND VOTED ON IN PROP SIXTY FOUR SO I THINK FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THIS IS A LOT OF SENSE AND WILL. TO- COMBAT THE ILLICIT MARKET AND ALLOW THOSE- OPERATORS WHO ARE TRYING TO PLAY BY THE RULES. HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE SAYS. WHAT I LIKE THIS AND I COMMEND YOU I COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR CHANGING THE POINT OF COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE- AS YOU KNOW WE ALL WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE LAST TIME WE- CONVENE THAT THE RIVER TO HAVE A CONVERSATION- I AM I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS EXCISE TAX. INCREASE DECREASE BUSINESS SO. THE CULTIVATION TAX WAS 4% THE EXCISE TAXES FIFTEEN PERCENT. SO DO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT AT 15% ZERO OUT THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND SEE WHETHER IT DRIVES UP CANNABIS SALES WHICH IN TURN IS REVENUE TO THE STATE THROUGH THE TAX. AND IF IT DOES NOT THEN THE NIGHT THEN THE EXCISE TAX GOES BACK 219% YES THAT'S CORRECT AND AGAIN IT'S LEGAL CANNABIS SALES THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DRIVE NO NO NO. NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT WHAT'S THAT IS THAT IS THE THAT IS THE MOST COMPROMISED THAT I THINK PEOPLE BEEN TRYING TO STRIKE IS LA- MENTIONED. I'M GOING TO STICK THE ENDS OF THE FUNDING. AND THE INDUSTRY AND- WELL I'M FASCINATED BY THE BY THIS THOUGHT SO WE'RE DOING IT 15% TO SEE IF IT INCREASES THE STAPLES IF IT DOESN'T OF LAWFUL LEGAL CANNABIS. IF IT DOESN'T INCREASE THE SALES WERE GOING TO INCREASE THE EXCISE TAX TO NINETEEN PERCENT. WHICH WOULD PROBABLY IS ASSUREDLY KEEP THE SALES LOW. YOU MIGHT WRITE SENATE SENATOR NIELSEN SAYS CHRISTINE WITH THE L. AND JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS THE WAY IT IS DONE AT THE OTHER END THIS IS ROUGH I'M SORRY SORRY SORRY. SENATOR RON AND HE WAITED TRAILER BILL IS CONSTRUCTED THE DEFAULT SO AS A DIRECTOR ELLIOT NEWBY THE- RETAIL EXCISE TAX WOULD REMAIN AT FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR- THROUGH THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEN STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE DEFAULT- EXCISE TAX RATE IN THE STATUTE WOULD BE NINETEEN PERCENT. THERE IS A PROCESS ARTICULATED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THROUGH WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IN PARTICULAR CD TFA IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD LOWER THE RATE BELOW 19% AS LOW AS FIFTEEN PERCENT. BUT THE WAY THE WAY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS PHRASED IT GIVES THEM THE OPTION TO DO THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NO NO REQUIREMENT TO DO SO I JUST STRICTER TO CLARIFY THE STRUCTURE AND THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD BE THE CASE FROM JANUARY FOR. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME ENHANCING OURENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON THOSE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THE ILLEGAL OPERATION- IT. IN THE CANNABIS SPACE SO ONE QUESTION ON THAT SCORE THE ANALYSIS SAYS. THE CHANGES INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT POLICIES TO INCREASE TAX COMPLIANCE AND COLLECTION AS WELL AS LABOR STANDARDS. THEN SAVE THOSE POLICIES NOT FUNDING DO YOU RENT DO YOU ANTICIPATE. GETTING TO THIS FUNDING ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE TO ENHANCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS WHETHER THOSE ARE GROWS OR SHOPS DISPENSARIES. I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT ON THE TAX SIDE- WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING MUCH LESS THAN ARE WE ALLOWED TO SPEND OUR TAX SIDE AND FRANKLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD USE A LITTLE MORE RESOURCES UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WHAT THIS DOES INCLUDE SOME VERY IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS- WHICH ARE NOT ANYTHING EARTH SHATTERING THEY JUST SIMPLY ALIGN THE CANNABIS LAWS. FRANKLY MORE WITH OUR SALES AND USE TAX LAWS BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE HAVE MORE TEETH IN SALES AND USE TAX WERE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW MORE AGGRESSIVELY GO AFTER- UNLIMITED TAX FROM A- B. MARTIN WE ARE FROM THE END OF THIS- BUSINESS. WHICH YOU KNOW IT IT'S- THAT WE'RE HAVING. I STILL HAVING IT LOOK. PROVIDES A SOME OF THE TOOLS WE CURRENTLY HAVEN'T- TAX COLLECTION SO I THINK. WITH THESE PROVISIONS WE CAN ALSO AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS WE HAVE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON SALES AND USE TAX THESE SAME TAXPAYERS WHO WILL NOW BE. TAXPAYERS HERE ARE OUR SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS- CURRENTLY AND SO I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT AND MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY DO THIS WITHOUT A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF NEW RESOURCES IF THERE ARE- RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AS- AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS WE WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK BUT I. DON'T ANTICIPATE. TO RESOURCE ISSUE AT THE MOMENT ON THE TAX SIDE AS MUCH AS IT IS A- YOU KNOW THE POLICY- INSTRUCTIONS ATTACKS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LAX ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS ARE REALLY HAMPERING OUR EFFORTS WELL I NEED IT PERHAPS IT'S THE LACK OF RESOURCES OR SOMETHING ELSE ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE. WELL AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE IN MY QUESTION ALSO GOES TO THAT SO I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE DRIVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S TO OR THROUGH OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL OR DOWN DIRECTLY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ADDRESS- WHAT APPARENTLY IS. ROBUST ILLEGAL. CANNABIS INDUSTRY OPERATING. THE. SURELY MANY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT. AND I IF I IF I MAY AND THIS IS NOT MY ROLE BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT CENTER OFTEN AND THIS GOES TO CENTER NIELSEN'S- COMMENTS AS WELL WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY. THE CHOSEN HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO LEGALIZE CANNABIS SALES BUT YET HAVE AN INCREDIBLY ROBUST ILLICIT CANNABIS. CANNABIS BUSINESSES OPERATING VERY OPENLY- WE ARE AWARE OF THOSE B. YOU NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT HELP- TO ADDRESS THOSE AND WE'RE GETTING IN SOME CASES THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS FOR GETTING. COMMUNITIES THEY'VE CHOSEN NOT TO LEGALIZE CANNABIS AND YET THEY'VE ALSO CHOSEN NOT TO ENFORCE THEIR- LAWS AGAINST YOU- AGAINST CANNABIS SALES AND YOU'RE SEEING A MUSHROOMING OF THIS ILLICIT BUSINESS WHICH IS- DETRIMENTAL TO THE STATE YOUR TAX REVENUE AND- UNFAIRLY HURTING THOSE PEOPLE WHO CHOSEN TO PLAY BY THE RULES ARE TRYING TO OPERATE. OKAY THIS WAS THE SYSTEM WELL THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE FOR ACTUALLY ASKING THAT QUESTION- I THINK ABOUT IT IT'S REALLY A PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE ISSUE SO I'LL- PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL OUR COLLEAGUES OVER THERE AND HAVE THEM ASK THE SAME QUESTION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE- THE RESPONSE. MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR ROB. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN ASKED- BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE DIETS BUT I JUST DO WANT TO SAY THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USE CANNABIS THAN ALL OF ITS FORMS- AND REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S- LEGALIZED IN THEIR PARTICULAR- OR IF IT'S- A LEVEL. THROUGH LEGALIZED WAYS IN THEIR COMMUNITY OR NOT AND IF WE WANT TO DRIVE FOLKS INTO THE LEGAL MARKET. THAT IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THE COST. OF THE PRODUCT. AND THE COST OF STARTING UP THE RETAIL BUSINESS AND SO IF WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IT. CHALLENGING OR EXPENSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE TO ENTER INTO THE MARKET PLACE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A ROBUST ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. AND SO IT IS A REALLY SORT OF. PRICKLY ISSUE AND ALSO I THINK A VERY- COMPLICATED LINE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WALK- BUT- PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR THEIR WEED IN A LEGAL MARKET PLACE IF THEY CAN GET IT FROM SOMEONE THAT'S REPUTABLE THAT THEY KNOW FOR A THIRD OR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE AND SO WE GOT TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE THAT. SO THAT'S MY SOAPBOX. YES SENATOR NELSON I CAN'T RESIST MY OWN SOAP BOX THOUGH AND THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AND TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE ILLICIT MARKET HAS NOT HAS GOT TO BE ADDRESSED. AND MOST ARE STICKING THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND LIKE AN OSTRICH AND IGNORING IT. AND WE ARE NOT COMMITTING THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO DO. REGULATE CONTROL AND DRIVE OUT THE ILLICIT MARKET. AND INCREASE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL THE DESPOILING OF THE LANDS AT THE CENTER OF THAT THEY DO. SO I JUST SUGGEST THAT WE CONSIDER THAT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE TIME IS NIGH IT'S OVERDUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO I THINK-WE HAVE EXHAUSTED- THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC I DON'T THINK THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SO THANK YOU ALL I DID HAVE THAT ONE QUESTION THAT I'M HOPING CAN GET ANSWERED ABOUT THE TAX PROPOSAL- FOR THE CARS FOR FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE ANY. HI MISTER WHITE. I THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTION- REGARDING THAT PART OF OUR- THE- DMB REBATE PROPOSAL IS ON. IS FOCUSED ON REGISTERED CAR OWNERS BUT WE ALSO HAVE A COMPONENT OF THE BROAD BASED PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES. F. FREE TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSIT SO- SPECIFICALLY SEVEN FIFTY NINE DOLLARS FOR THREE FREE MONTHS OF FREETRANSIT SERVICES SO THERE WERE WERE OUT OR GET IT TO SOME EXTENT WERE GETTING AT THAT. NOT NON VEHICLE OWNERS. SO I DECIDED NOT TO HAVE A CAR I'M GOING TO BUY AN ELECTRIC. UDAR OR BIKE. OF BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO LIMIT MY AMBITIONS. AND SO I'M SOMEHOW GOING TO GET. YEAH I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DON'T GET BUS PASSES BUT THAT'S THE REBATE THAT I WOULD GET. THE FREE CHAPTER. YEAH THERE'S A COMPONENT THAT THAT THEY HAD THAT HAS FUNDING FOR FREE TRANSIT SERVICE AND- THE SPECIFICS ABOUT I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU AS FAR AS LIKE YOUR YOUR EXAMPLE OF- YOU KNOW SOMEBODY THAT MAYBE DOESN'T. EVEN TAKE TRANSIT JUST RIDES A BIKE- I. I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU AS FAR AS- YES WE HAVE THAT IN THE PAST. THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THERE'S FOLKS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AN INTENTIONAL DECISION. TO NOT HAVE A DIESEL CAR. BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP US RESOLVE OUR CLIMATE CHALLENGES. SO THIS IS DESIGNED FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE GAS GUZZLING ALL WHO HAVE CARS SO FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO SAID I'M GOING TO OPT OUT OF THIS TO TRY TO FIND ANOTHER WAY. AND THEY MIGHT BE MIDDLE INCOME WHAT WHAT SPACE IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM IN THIS TAX PROPOSAL SO YOU MIGHT NOT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE FREE TRANSIT SERVICES THE RESPONSE. AND SO IT MIGHT BE GOOD JUST TO GET BACK TO ME ON THAT. YEAH DEFINITELY DO THAT THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. SO NOW WE HAVE REACHED OUT THE PORTION OF THE HEARING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. TWO TWO SIX EIGHT ONE SIX THREE AND THE ACCESS CODE IS SEVEN SIX TWO TWO FOUR SIX TWO. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME. ON TESTIMONY. TODAY I'M GOING TO ASK THAT EACH MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC PROVIDING COMMENT KEEP THEIR REMARKS WITHIN ONE MINUTE. NOW WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM AND THE LINE. HAS. THE OKAY OKAY. OKAY HELLO MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION. I THINK YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE GAS CAR THE CARS TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T DRIVE CARS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO DRIVE A CAR AND THAT LEADS ME TO THE PROPOSAL FROM THE KELLY I. T. C. COALITION WHICH- WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE MAY REVISION BUT WE ARE PROPOSING. THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BE USED FOR A ONE TIME ANTI POVERTY CHILD TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY- HELP MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN NOT FALL BACK INTO POVERTY AS A RESULT OF THE- TERMINATION OF THE FEDERAL I. C. T. C. AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR CAL E. I. T. C. MINIMUM CREDIT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH PERSON WHO'S ELIGIBLE WE KNOW THAT TAX X. KELLY AT SEA IN THE C. D. C. THE Y. C. T. C. WE KNOW. ARE EVIDENCED BASED SALUTE. THE PEOPLE OUT OF POP. AND WE THINK THAT IT THERE IT IS THE MOST RIGHTEOUS USE OF. THE SURPLUS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FINALLY TWENTY MILLION ABOVE WHAT'S IN THE GENERAL FUND IN TERMS OF. THE OUTRAGE AND FREE TAX PREPARATION SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO GET FREE HEALTHY CLAIM THESE CREDITS THAT CALIFORNIA IS GIVING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO H. AND R. BLOCK IN SPENDING. MORE MONEY TO GET THEIR TAXES PREPARED THAN THE CREDIT THAT THEY WENT THERE TO GET IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WE THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL AND FINALLY ONE LAST THING. EVENTING GOVERNMENT THAT INTERSECTION. FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THESE TAX CREDITS THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM. SO THAT THEY THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE CREDIT IS NOT CLEAN- FOR DEBT COLLECTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SHARES MEMBERS- THIS IS PUSH ON WOULD YOU ASPIRE- I WANTED TO MAKE MY COMMENTS ABOUT DID THE FBI PROGRAM- I WAS FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S HEARING AND JUST WANTED TO. APPRECIATE THE EXCELLENT COME AS YOU ARE MAKING MADAM CHAIR ON THE NEED FOR THE FBI TO PARTNER WITH OFFICES TO DO MORE WORK AT THIS OUTREACH AND THAT IS WHY IT YOU KNOW TO US AND YOU ASPIRE WE SUPPORT THE FUNDING- FORTY OF PID TEN MILLION ACTUALLY. DID WAS AT THE BROADER EFFORTS THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL WE THINK. THAT FUNDING. IS WHAT'S GOING TO ALLOW US AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP WHAT CAN DO THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH OFFICES AND CONTINUED OUTREACH WORK TO STUDENT BORROWERS SO WE HOPE THAT- THAT FUNDING COULD BE. INCLUDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND CANNOT CRAFT. MY COMMENTS TO PERTAIN TO THE CANNABIS PROVISIONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INVESTMENT OF THE TWENTY MILLION. IN INCENTIVE FUNDING TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO EXPAND LEGAL RETAIL WE'RE ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT ZERO OUT THE CULTIVATION TAX AND STREAMLINE AND SIMPLIFY. THE MANNER IN WHICH CANNABIS TAXES ARE COLLECTED. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN THE EXCISE TAX FROM 15% TO NINETEEN PERCENT. AND WE ALSO QUESTION. WELL GEE THAT WAS USED TO GET TO NINETEEN PERCENT. BASED ON OUR OWN ANALYSIS WE BELIEVE 19% REPRESENTS A TAX INCREASE ON THE INDUSTRY. AND IS NOT SIMPLY ACHIEVE REVENUE NEUTRALITY. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY WE FULLY CONCUR THAT REDUCING TAXES WILL INCREASE CONSUMER PARTICIPATION. IN THE LEGAL MARKET. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE LANGUAGE TO REMOVE THE AUTOMATIC AND SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. BE RECONSIDERED AND PLACE RIPLEY. SOME SORT OF- THAT ALLOWS THE EXCISE TAX TO FLUCTUATE UP OR DOWN TO MEET THE STATE'S A DUAL GOALS OF FUNDING VITAL PROGRAMS AND MIGRATING CONSUMER CELLULAR THE LEGAL MARKET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M SURE MEMBERS GRAND BARGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AS HELL HEALTHY HOUSING FOUNDATION WE URGE YOU INTERSECTION OF THE PROPOSED ADAPTIVE REUSE STATUTE. AND PROJECT HUNKY THE PROJECT HOME KEY ALLOWS FUNDS TO BE USED TO CONVERT HOTELS AND MOTELS ON BUT ONLY ALLOWS PUBLIC ENTITIES TO APPLY. THE ADAPTIVE REUSE PROPOSAL ALLOWS NONPROFITS LIKE HF TO APPLY BUT NOT DOES NOT ALLOW IT TO BE USED FOR HOTELS AND MOTELS AS A RESULT IN NONPROFIT LIKE HF IS SHUT OUT OF THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS. TO CONTAIN. TO BUILD UP AND IT'S THAT WE'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS- OUT OF HOTELS AND MOTELS FOR EXTREMELY AND VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE- INCOME PEOPLE ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT COMPANY- I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MICHIGAN'S RELATIVE TO THE- CANNABIS TAX REFORM SENATOR RUSS HAD A- ON THE MARKET. TO THE 19% IMPACT ON THE CONSUMER CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY GOING INTO THE ILLEGAL MARKET BECAUSE OF THE HIGH TAXES IF WE INCREASE THE TAXES MORE. THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE EVEN FURTHER INTO THE ILLEGAL MARKET IF YOU EVER HAVE AN OPTION TO PURCHASE- CANNABIS YOU'LL SEE ON THE RECEIPT THAT THAT THAT THE EXCISE TAX IS CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY. SO YOU'LL KNOW. HOW MUCH YOU'RE PAYING. SUDDENLY GOES UP FROM 15219% WHICH IS ACTUALLY A 26% INCREASE IN THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT- IT'S GOING TO DRIVE MORE PEOPLE INTO THE- ILLEGAL MARKET. I'M SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO REJECT IT EVER BECOMING A PERMANENT PART THE MIDDLE YEARS- I THINK THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THERE BUT BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND MAKING 19% PERMANENT. IS REALLY A WE THINK A VERY BAD IDEA OF. CONTROLLING THE- ILLEGAL MARKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANKS A MADAM CHAIR SENATOR ROTH'S CABIN AUSTIN REPRESENTING JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOU. FIRST OF I GOT TWO ISSUES TODAY ONE IS THE FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT- WE WANT TO THINK- STATE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE FOR CO SPONSORING THAT REQUEST WITH US- AND ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PUTTING IT.
