IT THE STATE TO SELL THREE TIMES THE BANK THIS WILL NOT THEN. WE'RE GOING TO HONOR YOU BY MAKING SURE WE KNOW THE CORRECT WAY TO PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME -- MEMBERS AGAIN [inaudible] WELCOME. ALL AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN WILL LEAD A SOFT BY PRESENTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR JOINING US. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR FOR HAVING ME AND THANK YOU TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS VEGAS FOR NOTHING I SERVICE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BUDGET AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY MAKING THREE POINTS ABOUT THE BUDGET TODAY. THE FIRST IS EXACTLY WHAT MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED AT THE START WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A BUDGET THAT IS BASED ON PHYSICAL% STRENGTH AND FISCAL RESILIENCY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUILDING THE SPACE OF FISCAL STRENGTH AS A PREDICATE FOR EXPANDING PROGRAMS AND MAKING THE INVESTMENT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS HE TALKED ABOUT CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND BUILDING A HOME THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN WEAPONS. AND AS WE ALL KNOW A GOOD HOME BEGINS WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE BEGINNING WITH RESILIENCY AT THE VERY START. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT IS A BOLD BUDGET IT'S INTENDED TO BE AN AMBITIOUS BUDGET. SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MAKING SOME THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING WILL RESULT IMMEDIATELY TAKE INCREASES TO YOU SEE CSU. CAL WORKS FOR EXAMPLE. SOME OF THE OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING ARE DESIGNED TO FACE AND OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AS WE BUILD CAPACITY AND MAKE THE FIND THE REVENUES TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. THESE ARE IN AREAS SUCH AS A PRESCHOOL CHILD CARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON BUILDING UP THE PATHWAY TO CHIEF SOME THESE PRIORITIES. BUT EVEN IN THOSE PLACES WHERE WE'RE FACING AND THE PROGRAMS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR PATIENCE WE BELIEVE THAT LAYING DOWN THAT MARKER RIGHT NOW AND SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO AND THIS IS HOW WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE IT. IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT WE OVERESTIMATE WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IN ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND UNDERESTIMATE WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IN FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS. AND WE HOPE BY LAYING DOWN THESE MARKERS THE BUDGET COULD MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IT REFLECTS HIS PRIORITIES. BUT I HOPE YOU'LL ALSO FIND AT THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT IT REFLECTS SOME OF YOUR PRIORITIES AS WELL. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW -- THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN IN TOUCH. AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE HE CALLED OUT SEVERAL YOU BY NAME IN TALKING ABOUT SOME HIS PROPOSALS. SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT HE WANTS TO CONTINUE THAT ALL OF US IN THE ADMINISTRATION HOPE TO CONTINUE. AND AS YOU DISCUSS THIS BUDGET AS YOU DELIBERATE ON IT AS YOU SHAPE IT AS YOU AMENDED. WE HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BUDGET REFLECTS BOTH HIS PRIORITIES AND YOURS. AND SO BEGINNING WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET WE'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING IN OUR GENERAL FIND. OUT WHEN YOU ADD IN SPECIAL FUNDS AND BOND FUNDS THE TOTAL COMES TO TWO HUNDRED NINE BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE WHAT THE GOVERNOR CALLED AN INTERESTING SURPLUS OF TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PROJECTED AT THE END OF THE COMING BUDGET YEAR. THAT'S A BIG SURPLUS WE ALSO KNOW FROM RECENT CALIFORNIA HISTORY THAT THE SURPLUS IS CAN BE EVANESCENT. THAT'S WHY IN THIS BUDGET WE HAVE A LARGE RATIO OF ONE TIME SPENDING COMPARED TO ONGOING SPENDING OVER 86% OF THE BUDGET FROM THE SURPLUS IS ONE TIME SPENDING. LESS THAN 14% IS ON GOING SPENDING THAT MEANS FOR EVERY SIX DOLLARS IN ONE TIME SPENDING COMMITTED OUT OF THE SURPLUS WE SPEND JUST A DOLLAR FOR ON GOING SPENDING. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BUDGET IS NOT JUST BALANCE THIS YEAR AND AS WE ALL KNOW. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WE HAVE TO SUBMIT A BALANCED BUDGET AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO ENACT. ONE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUDGET IS BALANCED OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD WHICH UNDER PROPOSITION TWO IS THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE BUDGET YEAR. SO IN OUR PROJECTIONS THE BUDGET WE PROPOSED SHOWS A POSITIVE OPERATING SURPLUS THAT MEANS REVENUES IN THAT YEAR AND EXPENDITURES IN THAT YEAR. NOT JUST FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A BUDGET ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE FACE GROWING RISKS. AS GOVERNOR BROWN OFTEN MENTIONED WE'RE APPROACHING THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION SINCE WORLD WAR. TWO THE STOCK MARKET BOTTOMED OUT IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND NINE SO TEN YEARS. FROM NOW WILL BE THIS SUMMER AND THAT MATCH THE EXPANSION THAT WE SAW BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN THE DOT COM CRASH HAPPENED. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS EXPANSION IS GOING TO AND THERE'S A FAMOUS SAYING AMONG ECONOMISTS THAT. THEY PREDICT NINE OUT OF THE LAST FIVE RECESSIONS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- WHAT CANNOT GO ON INDEFINITELY AT SOME POINT WILL COME TO A STOP AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT? WE SING DIZZYING VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET BUT THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED WITHIN THE BEGINNINGS OF A POSSIBLE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA -- WE HAVE A SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND WE'VE A WHITE HOUSE THAT CAN OFTEN BE UNPREDICTABLE. AND SO WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER THERE'S A LOT TO WATCH OUT FOR AND OUR DEPARTMENT HAS MODELED A RECESSION SCENARIO TO SEE HOW OUR BUDGET WOULD WHETHER RECESSION. THERE A RECESSION SOONER THAT THEY MODELS -- HAS A RECESSION THAT IS LESS SEVERE THAN THE RECESSION THAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND NINE THE GREAT RECESSION BUT MORE SEVERE THAN THE RECESSION THAT HAPPENED AT TWO THOUSAND ONE AT THE END OF THE DOT COM CRASH. AND UNDER THAT MODEL WE FOUND THAT THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- BEFORE ANY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT EIGHT ADJUSTMENT AFTER ONE YEAR. AND SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS AFTER THREE YEARS -- SO THAT'S A BIG GAP THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL LOGIC THAT RECESSION COMES OUR WAY. AND EVEN WITHOUT A RECESSION WE'RE FORECASTING SLOWING REVENUE GROWTH ABOUT THREE POINT PERIOD. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO BE READY FOR AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHY AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED WE'RE STARTING WIH RESILIENCY THIS BUDGET INCLUDES TEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE SURPLUS AND RESILIENCY INVESTMENTS. IN DIGITAL THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM PROPOSITION TWO PAYMENTS TO FURTHER BUILD RESILIENCY. AND LET ME GO TO REACH THOSE IN TURN. THE FIRST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS TO PAY OFF BUDGETARY JACKSON DEFERRALS AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN CAME INTO OFFICE HE POINTED TO WHAT HE FAMOUSLY CALLED THE WALL OF TAX. MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGETARY AND RELATED DEBTS. THEY'RE STILL OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT JACK REMAINING AT THE START THIS BUDGET PERIOD. THIS BUDGET -- PROPOSES TO PAY THOSE BUDGETARY DEBTS ARE -- WHEN AND GOVERNOR'S WERE TRYING TO DO -- THEY USE. WHAT SOME CALL SOME KLAY PUSH A PAYMENT INTO THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR FOR THAT PAYMENT IS STILL THE STATE HAS TO MAKE IT BUT IT WASN'T REFLECTED IN THAT YEAR? THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TO REVERSE AND DOES ONE PAYMENT TO CALPERS OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ANOTHER A PAYROLL TO FOR ALL OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE HOPING BY MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS WHEN THEIR SCHEDULE WHEN WE'RE SCHEDULE TO MAKE THEM. WE CAN FURTHER BUILD RESILIENCY AND GET OUR BUDGET ON TRACK. THE SECOND THING THIS BUDGET DOES IN THE RESILIENCY DEPARTMENT IS BILLS RESERVES. IT PUTS TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SINCE THE SPECIAL FINE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S THE FUN THAT THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR ACCESS IN EMERGENCIES. INCLUDING THE RECENT WILDFIRES THAT WE SAW IN CALIFORNIA IN NOVEMBER. IT ALSO PUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH I KNOW THE CHAIR PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THINKING ABOUT CREATING. THIS IS A FINE THAT MAKES SURE THAT IN A DOWNTURN WE CAN PROTECT OUR MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS PROGRAMS WHICH HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT FUND CURRENTLY HAS A BALANCE OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE PROPOSING TO MORE THAN QUADRUPLE EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE LAST THING WE DO FOR ON THE RESERVE FRONT IS MAKE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. OFTEN KNOWN AS THE RAINY DAY FUND AND ONE NOTE THAT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT INITIALLY UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN'S LAST BUDGET. THIS WAS FORECASTED TO REACH ITS PROPOSITION. TWO HOWEVER -- WE RECEIVED OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OPINION WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION CONCURS WITH WHICH BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY PAYMENTS THAT APPLY TO THAT 10% CAP OR MANDATORY DEPOSITS UNDER PROPOSITION. TWO BECAUSE ONLY PAYMENTS ARE PER SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY ITS RESTRICTIONS SO EVEN THOUGH -- THAT BALANCE OF THE FUND ILL BE MORE THAN 10% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES AT THE END OF THIS BUDGET YEAR WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER LAW WE ARE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE PUTTING MONEY INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND. SO THAT IT WILL REACH FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF THIS YEAR UP FROM THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IT WILL APPROACH TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WILL BE A REAL IMPORTANT BUFFER IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THE FINAL THING THAT THIS BUDGET DOES ON THE WERE ON THE PHYSICAL RESILIENCY FRONT IS MAKE IT BIG PAY DOWN. OUR RETIREE LIABILITIES AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THAT NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HELPS US MEET OUR PROMISES TO OUR RETIREES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF RESULTS IN BIG SAVINGS DOWN THE ROAD. THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE CALPERS SYSTEM THAT WE ARE PROPOSING WILL RESULT IN SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND CAL STAR IS PAYMENTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. COMBINED WITH THE PROJECTED ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL RESULT IN SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. WE ALSO PROPOSE CONTINUING WITH PROPOSITION TWO PAYMENTS TO PRE FUND A RETIREE HEALTH CARE LIABILITY AND TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN FROM OUR SPECIAL FUNDS THAT WAS USED TO MAKE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALPERS. TWO YEARS AGO. IN ALL OF THESE AS WE WERE AS WE KNOW WE'RE RELYING ON PROJECTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE THESE NUMBERS THROUGH MAY AND JUNE AND IN THE MONTHS TO COME. WHEN WE GET TO THE IMPORTANT BOARD SPENDING PRIORITIES THAT THE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT -- I WANT TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD WHICH IS SUCH A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND I KNOW FOR SO MANY OF YOU. THIS BUDGET BEGINS WITH A LOOKING FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA -- FOUR YEAR OLDS ON AN ELIGIBLE MEANS FAMILIES THAT ARE FROM 85% OR BELOW A MEDIAN INCOME. THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IN GENERAL FUND FUNDING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT TO ADD ADDITIONAL SLOTS. AND WE HOPE TO GET OUT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT TARGET AND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. FOR ALL ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE ALSO WE ALSO PROPOSED ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT APPEAR IN IS WORKING OR IN SCHOOL IN ORDER FOR THEIR OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE CHILD. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORE THAN 20% OF DISTRICTS DO NOT OFFER FULLY FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WE KNOW THAT'S A SPENDING ISSUE BUT THAT'S ALSO A CAPACITY AND FACILITY ISSUE. SO THIS BUDGET PROPOSES AGAIN ONE TIME SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND RETROFIT SOME OF OUR CLASSROOMS IN OUR SCHOOL SO THAT THEIR ADOPTABLE FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. AND MORE FAMILIES CAN SEND THEIR KIDS. HE ALSO PROPOSED A SIMILAR INVESTMENT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CHILD CARE FACILITIES AND THAT ALSO IMPROVES TRAINING UP THE CHILD CARE WORK FORCE BECAUSE WITHOUT CHILD CARE IS A BIG REASON WHY FAMILIES ARE FEELING SUCH A SQUEEZE IN THIS ECONOMY. AND WE WANT TO GET STARTED ON THE PATH TO ADDRESS THAT WE ALSO INCLUDE -- FOR THIS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WHERE MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE ALSO PERRANCE ATTENDS UP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH GOES FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT A LOT OF THAT MONEY CAN ALSO GO TO CHILD CARE -- FOR FACILITIES AND OTHER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. AND FINALLY WITH ALL OF THESE THE GUYS MENTION THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT A BOLD AGENDA BUT WE KNOW THAT IT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED AND STOPS. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO REALLY GET UNDER THE HOOD AND SEE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR ALL FAMILIES NOT JUST ELIGIBLE. UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE -- FULL DAY TO ACHIEVE THOSE SO WE HOPE THAT THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR STUDY WILL RESULT IN ROBUST REVENUE OPTIONS -- PROGRAM OPTIONS AND THINGS THAT WE CAN PURSUE. IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAL WORKS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONGOING SPENDING COMMITMENTS AND THIS BUDGET -- WE PROPOSE INCREASING UP 250% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THE MAXIMUM GRANT THAT MEANS FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IN WHICH ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING ASSISTANCE. THAT GRANT WOULD GO TO EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS -- AND THAT'S A BIG COMMITMENT AS I MENTIONED IN THIS BUDGET YEAR WERE FORECASTING THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. THAT WILL GROW TO NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN YEARS TO COME. BUT WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE GOVERNOR POINTED TO DIE IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE HOW THIS IS A CORE COMMITMENT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE INCREASING IT 250% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN OUR PROPOSAL BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE FURTHER GROWTH THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF REALIGNMENT AND THE CHILD POVERTY SUB ACCOUNT. SO THAT GRANT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE YEARS TO COME. WE ALSO PROPOSE MORE MONEY FOR LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUNDS. AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ENFORCE CHILD SUPPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THAT SHOULD RESULT IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS. THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO CARE IT'S OFTEN OUR MOST LOW INCOME NEEDIEST KIDS -- AND THEN FINALLY I MADE A POINT ABOUT STUDENT PARENTS -- THIS A BIG PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION SCHOOL WORK WITH CHILD CARE AND IF WE ALLOW THE STUDENT PARENTS TO ACCESS EDUCATION IT'S GOOD FOR THEM IT'S GOOD FOR THEIR FUTURE EARNING POTENTIAL IT'S GOOD FOR THEIR KIDS THEIR ROLE MODELS FOR THEIR KIDS AND IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US. TO THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A BIG ON GOING COMMITMENT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE CAL GRANT A AND B. LEVEL UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CAL GRANT SEA LEVEL UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT PARENTS CAN ACCESS THIS FUNDING SO THIS INCREASES% ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT POPULATION IT ALSO INCREASES BY NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS UNDER THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW -- FOR A NUMBER OF HISTORICAL REASONS CAL GRANTS ARE OFTEN -- ELIGIBLE CERTAIN CATEGORIES ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IN THE WORK FORCE. RAISING THEIR KIDS HAVE MORE OF A CHANCE TO GET BACK INTO SCHOOL AND GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. ONE OTHER PRIORITYON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SIDE IS FOR SCREENINGS AND HOME BASE AT THIS BUDGET INCLUDES -- SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN YOU TAKE BUT GENERAL FUND AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO INCLUDE AT INCLUDE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE IN OTHER TRAUMA SCREENINGS -- FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AT NINE EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY MONTHS SOME OF THE SCREENS ARE ALREADY COVERED BUT THEY'RE NOT HAPPENING AT THE RATES THAT WE WOULD ONCE WERE HOPING BY PUTTING MORE MONEY AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT MORE. PEOPLE GET THE SCREENINGS THEY NEED AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE GETTING SCREENING THEY CAN GET REFER TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ALREADY ENTITLED TO UNDER THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WE ALSO IMPROVE MONEY FOR HOME VISITING WHICH IS A PROVEN WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT MOTHERS ESPECIALLY NEW MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND FAMILIES. UNDERSTAND THE BEST PRACTICES IN TERMS OF RAY START IN LIFE ON THAT SPOT FOR ELIGIBLE CAL WORKS FAMILIES AS WELL AS FOR OTHER FAMILIES. AND WE ALSO INCLUDE SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH IS A CRITICAL PROGRAM TO REDUCE INEQUITIES IN BIRTH WEIGHTS AND OTHER METRICS THAT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE FOR HEALTH SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PROGRAM HAS THE FUNDING. THAT IT MEETS THE CHAIRED MATCHING PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- WE SET A GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD BORN HAS UP TO SIX MONTHS OF CARE FROM PARENTS AND OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IN TERMS OF HOW WE GET FROM HERE TO THERE AND HOW TO MAKE THAT PROPOSAL REALITY. SO WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A TASK FORCE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH WITH YOU BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. TWO OTHER POINTS I WANT TO MENTION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD ONE IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SEAT GRANT TO PARTNER WITH FIRST FIVE AND OTHER LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ESTABLISH CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR INCOMING KINDERGARTNERS. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT EVEN A SMALL DEPOSIT ON BEHALF OF A CHILD CAN GROW OVER TIME IT HELPS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BUILD ASSETS. AND IT PUTS FAMILIES IN A COLLEGE GOING MINDSET SO WE WANT TO GET THAT PROGRAM STARTED IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN IN THE EAST BAY. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON MORE OF A STATEWIDE LEVEL WORKING WITH LOCAL WORK ORGANIZATIONS. OF CHAIRED ALSO MENTION THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- WHICH WERE PROPOSING TO RENAME THE WORKING FAMILIES TAX CREDIT -- BUT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT -- RIGHT NOW IT'S AT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING WE'RE PROPOSING INCREASING THIS PROGRAM TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING. AND THIS WOULD INCREASE ELIGIBILITY FOR FAMILY MMHM WAGE MAKING SURE THAT WORKING FAMILY WITH A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AT THAT WAGE LEVEL CAN STILL ACCESS TO CREDIT. NOW RIGHT NOW THE CREDIT IS TARGETED IN THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES WHICH IS GREAT AND THAT'S HOW THE ADMINISTRATION DESIGNED IT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE SOME OF THE TAX REFUNDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WE ALSO PROVIDE A MORE GENEROUS CREDIT FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND FINALLY RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND THE COST WE'VE GOT THEIR UNDER. WE'RE PROPOSING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ADDITIONAL TAX CREDIT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING I'VE DESCRIBED FOR FAMILIES WITH KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF SIX SO WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POLICY WERE POPERY PROPOSING TO PAY FOR IT TO WRITE TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE. OFTEN WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSES A TAX REFORM STATES CHOOSE TO CONFORM FOR SIMPLICITY REASONS AND FOR REASONS THAT ARE GOOD POLICY -- AND WAYS ---THAT CHANGE THE TAX CODE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE TAXPAYERS SO WE'RE PROPOSING A COUPLE CHANGES -- IN TERMS OF LIMITING LOSSES THAT BUSINESS OWNERS CAN TAKE AGAINST OTHER INCOME. AS WELL SOME CHANGES THAT WILL ACTUALLY DEPRIVED THE STATE OF REVENUE BUT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT REVENUE CHANGES SUCH AS SIMPLIFYING ACCOUNTING RULES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. HIGH AT TWO CONFORMING ON THESE ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACCOUNTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN SAY FOR THEIR EXPENSES. AND CONFORMING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES ZONES WHICH I KNOW MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT. TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN THOSE AREAS. I WANT TO MOVE ON NOW TO K. -- TWELVE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS BUDGET UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS THE HIGHEST EVER LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE OR AYE RATHER I SHOULD SAY K. FOURTEEN SCHOOLS. IT'S EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS NINETY SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST YEAR% AND IT'S UP FROM FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AT THE START OF THIS DECADE WHICH WAS THE RECESSIONARY WELL. SO WHEN YOU GO FROM THAT FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS UP TO THE EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR LEVEL THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THAT'S ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ON A PER PUPIL BASIS. ON AND IN THIS BUDGET COMPARED TO JUST LAST YEAR THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE INCLUDE INCLUDES TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. ON AND ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SPECIAL EDUCATION IS AN AREA WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED TO COVERING A BIG SHARE. AND MOST RECENTLY -- NAY 2240% OF COVERING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING OR THAT WAS THE GOAL THAT THE IS THAT ESTABLISHED THE STILL AT ABOUT INCUMBENT ON THE STATE. AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT WISH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HELP US OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. I WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT IN ADDITION AND THIS IS OUTSIDE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUT N ADDITION TO THE BUDGET RESILIENCY PAYMENTS THAT I DESCRIBED WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING. AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- THAT WE PROJECT WILL SAVE SCHOOLS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FOLLOWING BUDGET YEAR AND THEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT WE THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW EVEN WITH THESE BIG INCREASES. OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE -- THEIR PENSION PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN RISING FOR THE RETIRED TEETH FOR THEIR ACTIVE AND RETIRED TEACHERS TO ABOUT -- NOT THIS YEAR BUT THE YEAR AFTER THIS BUDGET YEAR IT 1% PAYROLL WE KNOW THAT'S A LOT AND WE THINK THIS THREE BILLION DOLLARS WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HELPING THEM. MANAGE THOSE COSTS. THREE OTHER FINAL POINTS I WANT TO MAKE ON K. TWELVE FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR CAN TUNING ON A PRIORITY THAT HE MENTIONED IN HIS CAMPAIGN. IS COMMITTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A LONGITUDINAL DATA -- PROGRAM AND THIS AGAIN IS THE FIRST STEP IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS TO IMPLEMENT. BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW HOW OUR KIDS ARE DOING FROM CRADLE ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CAREER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING ON WHAT. WE'RE PROMISING THEM AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN SCHOOL AND HOW WE'RE EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS IS ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCE. TO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU ON AND DEVELOPING THAT SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE IT'S SERVING OUR STUDENTS. A SECOND POINT IN THIS BUDGET IS WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR PROPOSITION -- NINETY EIGHT AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY IN PRIOR YEARS AND A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN FUTURE YEARS AND I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THAT IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. THE FINAL POINT THAT ONE THING THAT THE GOVERNOR HEARD A LOT BOTH IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD IS UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE IT WAS A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BOND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR SCHOOLS. AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THERE IS SOME SENSE THAT THAT MONEY IS NOT GETTING OUT THE DOOR TO ACTUALLY FIND SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AS QUICKLY AS IT SHOULD. US WE'RE PROPOSING BOND FINDING WE'RE PROJECTING ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS GOING OUT THE DOOR THIS YEAR. THAT'S OVER A 100% INCREASE TO THE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WENT OUT THE DOOR IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION WHICH HELPS US EVALUATE THESE PROPOSALS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION BONDS CAN GET I CAN GET FUNDED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I WANT TO MOVE ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION THIS IS A PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR -- FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HE SAT BOTH ON THE UC BOARD OF REGIONS AND THE CAL STATE BOARD OF TRUSTEES -- AND HE'S PROPOSING BIG -- ONGOING INCREASES WHICH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY OVERTIME FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR CSU. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HE'S PROPOSING A SIX POINT 9% INCREASE THAT'S WELL ABOVE THE 3% OR 4% INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS -- THAT'S TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INCLUDE THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESIDENCY SLOTS. AND IN ADDITION IN ONE TIME FUNDING HE'S PROPOSING A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THIS FUNDING WILL G THROUGH TOWARD A VARIETY OF PURPOSES ABLE INCREASE ENROLLMENT. WERE ASKING IS A CONDITION OF FUNDING THAT THE UC FREEZE TUITION FOR STUDENTS -- AND WE'RE ALSO ASKING THEM TO IMPROVE DEGREE COMPLETION THIS FUNDING ALSO GOES FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE AND FOR HUNGER AND HOUSING INITIATIVES. IT ALSO INCLUDES ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE UC DAVIS FIREARMS VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER ON AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND FUNDING -- RESEARCH INTO VIOLENCE REDUCTION A NOT INSIGNIFICANT FUNDING CAN CONTINUE TO FLOW TO THE CENTER FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY DO. FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WILL PROVOKE WE PROPOSE AN EVEN BIGGER INCREASE OF 8% AND THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT -- WANTED AT LEAST AT THE GOVERNOR HAS IS THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT SERVES YOU KNOW OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S THE BACKBONE IN TERMS OF OUR TEACHERS AND OUR NURSES AND SO MANY OF OUR OTHER PROFESSIONALS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS THE SUPPORT THAT IT NEEDS TO THAT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING. AND IN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INCLUDING CHILD CARE. THAT INCLUDES SEVEN THOUSAND NEW SLOTS THAT'S A 2% GROWTH IN ENROLLMENT WERE ALSO ASKING THEM FOR TUITION FREEZE AND THEY HAVE THIS GRADUATION TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INITIATIVE TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES -- AND MAKING SURE THEY GET WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO FURTHER FIND THOSE EFFORTS. ALSO EFFORTS AS WITH YOU SEE ON IMMIGRATION HUNGER AND HOUSING AND ONE OTHER AGAIN SMALLER COMPARED TO THE OTHER NUMBERS THAT OF DESCRIBING BUT NOT INSIGNIFICANT A TWO MILLION DOLLAR PLANNING GRANT. OFFER AT CSU POSSIBLE NEW CAMPUS IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND STOCKTON. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS IN TERMS OF THINKING WHERE THAT CAN BE SHOULD BE EXACTLY AND HOW IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT PRIORITY BECAUSE IF WE ARE HAVING PROJECTING A SHORTFALL IN THE COLLEGE GRADUATES COMPARED TO WHAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO EXPAND CAPACITY BOTH AT EXISTING CAMPUSES BUT ALSO MAKE SURE. THAT STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT BE CLOSE TO UC AND CSU HAVE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. FINALLY IN THE CSU BUDGET WE INCLUDE A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROJECT REBOUND WHICH IS AN INITIATIVE FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WERE NOW STUDENTS TO GET THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. FINALLY ON COMEY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE PROPOSE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE THE SECOND YEAR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE FOR TUITION WISE FOR FULL YEAR FULL TIME STUDENTS. WE INCLUDE A BIG COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WE PROPOSED TO REVISE THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND AGAIN AS WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT CERTIFICATION I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT ANY OF THE DETAILS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. AND WE ALSO PROPOSE UNDER PROPOSITION FOR MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUND FINDING THAT WOULD PROJECT WILL GO OUT THE DOOR AND THAT'S FUNDING TWENTY SEVEN YOU ARE ON GOING PROJECTS. WE ALSO INCLUDE INCLUDE A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY THIS IS FOR SUMMER MEALS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THEIR LOCAL LIBRARY. AGAIN NOT A SPEC NUMBER COMPARED TO THE OTHER NUMBERS BUT REALLY IMPORTANT. INCLUDE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDENT LOAN AWARENESS BECAUSE EVEN AS WERE FOCUSED ON AFFORDABILITY FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO REALLY CARE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY THEY'VE ALREADY ACCUMULATED IT'S AN ALBATROSS AROUND THEIR NECK. AND THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE REPAYMENT PLANS AND OPTIONS THAT THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AND FINALLY WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN AND INLAND EMPIRE REGION'S. SO THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT AN EDUCATION LET ME MOVE ON TO HEALTHCARE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THREE BROAD GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE IT'S IMPROVING ACCESS REDUCING COSTS AND IMPROVING QUALITY AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. IS FINDING A WAY FOR ALL THESE GOALS TO FIT TOGETHER. CON IS VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THAT A BIG EVER SIGNED A BIG EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TERMS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HOW MEDI CAL NEGOTIATES FOR THEM. ALSO STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATIVE AND WE EXPECT THAT IN FUTURE YEARS THIS COULD SAVE THE STATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS THE STATE MOVES TOWARD BULK PURCHASING AND AS MEDI CAL IN PARTICULAR TRANSFORMS FROM MEDICAL MANAGED CARE NEGOTIATION TO AN OVERALL FEE FOR SERVICE BENEFIT. IN OUR BUDGET HOWEVER WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DETAILS OF THIS ARE BEING WORKED OUT AND WE'RE NOT PROJECTING ANY SAVINGS UNTIL THE OUT YEAR IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT'S WHEN WE BELIEVE. THAT THE SAVINGS WILL ACTUALLY KICK IN FOR OUR STATE REINSTATE THE MANDATE THAT HAS LAPSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THE UNINSURED RATE LOW -- PROJECTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT IF WE DO NOT TAKE THE STATUS OF THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE STATE CAN INCREASED BY ALMOST A MILLION PEOPLE -- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TED THAT THAT PENALTY CAN KEEP OUR HISTORICALLY LOW UNINSURED RATE WHERE IT IS -- AND ANY SO ANY -- PENALTY REVENUE THAT COMES FROM THAT NEW MANDATE WE WILL USE THAT TO PUT RIGHT BACK INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR INCREASED SUBSIDIES FOR FAMILIES BETWEEN AND 4100% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL AS WELL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE SUBSIDIES FOR FAMILIES BETWEEN LEVEL. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE PURCHASING. INSURANCE ON THE EXCHANGES WE ALSO HAVE OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHICH IS PROJECTED SERVE OVER THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS YEAR. IT'S A HUNDRED POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THAT'S TWENTY TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR GENERAL FUND AND WE MAKE A NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS HERE -- UNDER PROP FIFTY SIX WERE DEVOTING MORE OF THAT MONEY TO RATE INCREASES FOR PROVIDERS THAT MORE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS CAN ACTUALLY GET A CHANCE TO SEE THE PROVIDERS WHOM THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO SEE -- WE'RE FORECASTING SOME MODERATION IN THE GROWTH OF MEDICARE HOW OUR CASE LOAD HAS MODERATED SOME OF OUR COSTS DECLINED -- COMPARED TO WHAT WE PROJECTED -- AND ALSO -- THERE WERE SOME RECONCILIATIONS INTER THE TIMING OF THE HOSPITAL QUALITY INSURANCE FEE AND THAT ACCOUNTS GOING BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING FOR PART OF THAT NATURE SURPLUS OF TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE PROJECTING FOR THIS YEAR. ONE OTHER MAJOR POINT ABOUT MEDI CAL WHICH THE GOVERNOR NOW ANNOUNCED JUST AS HE WAS COMING INTO OFFICE IS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AN EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF NINETEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO AGE -- TWENTY SIX AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM FOR ON DOCUMENTING RESIDENTS BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE EIGHTEEN SO THIS WOULD EXTEND THAT THROUGH AGE. TWENTY FIVE WERE PROJECTING ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THAT PROGRAM HOWEVER BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW INSURED UNDER THAT PROGRAMS WILL NOT NEED TO ACCESS AS MANY COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES NOW THAT THEY HAVE FULL SCOPE HEALTH COVERAGE. WERE ACTUALLY PROJECTING SOME SAVINGS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT WILL FLOW BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND FROM THE COUNTY INDIGENT HEALTH PROGRAM SOMEONE UNITED ALL OUT FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROGRAM IT SHOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COST. TO THE GENERAL FUND. FOR ALSO MAKING A NUMBER OF JAIL ADJUSTMENTS ON MENTAL HEALTH -- WE'RE PROPOSING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE KNOW PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS PRIMARY CARE THE PROVIDER SHORTAGE IS A PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND WE'RE ASKING NONPROFIT AND OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO MATCH SOME THIS FUNDING TO FURTHER ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE'RE PROPOSING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FNDING FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH AND TREATMENT SO THAT WE CAN INTERVENE. AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE -- WERE WERE GLAD THAT THAT TO BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME WAS APPROVED LAST NOVEMBER AND WE'RE HOPING TO ALSO GET THOSE FUNDS FLOWING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT'S FUNDING FOR SERVICES PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN GET THE HOUSING SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED -- AND FINALLY THROUGH SOME CHANGES TEN NINE CHECKING THAT ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE THEIR ADDITIONALLY FOR COUNTIES TO PUT INTO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND LET ME TALK ABOUT THOSE AYE HSS CHANGES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE LIKE CAL WORKS THIS IS A BIG ONGOING COMMITMENT FROM OUR OVERALL SURPLUS THAT WILL BE THAT WE'RE FORECASTING INTO THE YEARS TO COME. I HSS SERVES OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND HELPS THEM WITH DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL CARE SERVICES THAT THEY CANNOT PERFORM ADEQUATELY ON THEIR OWN. AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO BIG -- CHANGES THE FIRST IS A REVISION TO THE COUNTY MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT -- THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING GROWING COST COMPARED TO WHAT WAS INITIALLY PROJECTED INCLUDING FOR SOME INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE AS WELL AS OTHER POLICY CHANGES AT BOTH THE STATE. AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO REDUCE THAT AMMO WE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR -- AND THEN CHANGE THE INFLATION FACTOR 24% IN COMING YEARS ON AND THEN AS A RESULT OF THAT REDUCED AND WE COUNTIES CAN REDIRECT SOME THAT FUNDING. BACK TO COUNTY INDIGENT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AS I WAS DISCUSSING -- SAID THIS IS A BIG COST -- WE'RE PROJECTING IN THE CURRENT YEAR TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WILL RISE TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE OUT YEARS. THE SECOND THING THAT WERE DUE IN PERCENT CUT TO AYE HSS SERVICE HOURS THAT WAS DESIGNED TO GOING TO PLACE WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX ALSO KNOWN AS THE MCO TAX. ON THE SET TO TAKE A FACT AND BY RESTORING THAT FUNDING WE'RE PROJECTING THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR. RISING TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE YEAR SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OUT YEARS BOTH THESE PROGRAMS YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONDOLLARS IN EACH OF THEM. BUT WE THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE THIS IS A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE -- WHEN WE'RE REALIGNING RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE TO PAY FOR THEM AND SECOND MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU UNDERSTAND THE REVENUE PRESSURES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES? SPACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM AND THEY HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO. SO WE THINK THIS IS A BETTER AGREEMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD PICK THIS UP FROM THE GENERAL FUND. SO ON THAT AND CO TAX -- IT'S PROJECTED TO EXPIRE THIS SUMMER -- AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT -- IN THINKING ABOUT DESCRIBING HOW THIS TAX FUNCTIONS I ALWAYS GO BACK -- TO QUOTATION -- THAT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN -- SAID WHEN YOU. VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU BECAUSE I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IF I WANTED -- TO BUT THE TRUTH IS A LONG STORY SHORT THIS IS A TAX -- NETWORKS WERE NUMBER MECHANISMS THAT DRAWS DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS ANSWER THE QUESTION WE'VE RECEIVED A NOTICE WILL BE PART OF A DISCUSSION. ON WHY HAVE WE NOT INCLUDED THIS IN OUR JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I THINK THE REASON IS TWO FOLD FIRST OF ALL WE WERE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. ON IT SO WE WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAN WE COUNT ON WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT'S IN OUR BUDGET AND WHAT THE REVENUES ARE. AND SECOND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF OBVIOUSLY THE SHUT DOWN IS GOING ON BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS TWO BIG WAIVERS THAT ARE COMING UP FOR RENEGOTIATION THE NEXT YEAR. THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ON MEDI CAL FOR A MEDICAID PROGRAM THE CURRENT VALUE OF THAT IS OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS. AND WE ALSO HAVE IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THAT SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW IT'S A TOP PRIORITY OF OURS. TO GET THOSE WAIVERS RENEGOTIATED AND MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND A GOOD PLACE SO GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THOSE WAIVERS -- WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE RIGHT NOW. ONE LAST POINT ON THIS -- IS ON SSI AND S. S. P. PROGRAM -- THE CHANGE -- THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR TO ELIMINATE THE CASH OUT POLICY THAT PREVENT. CALPERS BENEFITS ON THAT WAS CHANGED ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- WE PROPOSE CHANGING THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS AND ANYBODY WHO UNDER THE FORMULA MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED REDUCED ACCESS TO THESE BENEFITS WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS AND CONTINUE AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT THEY WERE ACCESSING. BEFORE. FINAL POINT IN THE HEALTHCARE SIDE -- IS ON IMMIGRATION WHICH A LOT OF THE FUNDING FLOWS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- WE HAD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST BUDGET YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. BUT WERE ALSO PROPOSING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RAPID RESPONSE FINE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES WHEREVER THEY CALM WEATHER THE COMING FROM TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE AT THE BORDER AND THIS FUNDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEALING WITH CRISES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. RIGHT AWAY. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING -- FINAL COUPLE HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BEST BUDDIES PROGRAMS TEMPLATE EMPLOYMENT-OPPORTUNITIES -- AND WE'RE ALSO HOPING FOR THAT FUNDING TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL AND CERTAINLY THAT INCLUDES OUR OFFICES IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO HIRE SOMEONE FOR YOUR OFFICE THROUGH THE BEST BUDDIES PROGRAM I KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR AS WELL. WERE ALSO PROPOSING NEW MONEY FOR OUTSIDE HELP ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH AND INCLUDING WHY THIS DISEASE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY OF THE FIRST -- FORMER FIRST LADY OF CALIFORNIA MARIA SHRIVER SHE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT -- AND IT'S SOMETHING WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU INCLUDING AND YOU GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON ELSE AMHERST PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS. AND WE FINALLY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS TREATMENT FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. I WANT TO MOVE ON NOW TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND LET ME START WITH HOMELESSNESS -- WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS IN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW. ON AND WE KNOW THAT MORE MONEY IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT IT WILL NEVER BE THE SOLUTION BY ITSELF SO WE NEED MONEY COMBINED WITH STRONG APPROACHES THAT CAN HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE. SO WE'RE PROPOSING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING THESE ARE FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS AND ALL THIS FUNDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE THIRTEEN BIGGEST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. FROM LOS ANGELES ALL THE WAY TO STOCKTON ON THESE ARE CITIES WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ABOVE -- WERE ALSO PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT ANYBODY INCLUDING THE CITY'S CAN APPLY FOR THROUGH THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THESE ARE AREAS DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT -- AND THE KEY THING THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN DESIGNING AND GIVING OUT THIS FINDING IS THAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE REGIONAL THEM AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR BEFORE HE WAS GOVERNOR BEFORE HE WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR -- SERVED AS MAYOR AND THAT THE HEAD OF BOTH THE CITY AND ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO HE REALLY CATS AND UNDERSTANDS HOW THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE REACHED ON NATURE. SO THAT WILL BE A CORE PRIORITY. ONE OTHER POINT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS FUNDING -- YOU SAW THAT IT STARTED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT HIT THESE MILESTONES WILL BE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN USE FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT THE WEST. AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS START FOR FUNDS THAT THEY SEE THAT IF THEY DO THE RIGHT THING ON HOMELESSNESS AND IF THEY WORK WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THEY CAN ACESS THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE ALSO PROPOSE UNDER OUR HOMELESSNESS AGENDA STREAMLINING A SEQUEL FOR THESE -- HOMELESS SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS -- WITH THE OPERATING THEORY BEING IF WE CAN DO IT FOR A SPORTS STADIUM HOW WE CAN DO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HAVE A PLACE. FOR SHELTER WE ALSO PROPOSING MAKING SOME CHANGES TO CALTRANS AIRSPACE REGULATIONS ON AND ALSO BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR SSI BUT AREN'T ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM WERE INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING FOR SSI ADVOCACY -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE BUILT THE SINCE THE BUDGET IN PRIOR YEARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S THERE. YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE ON HOMELESSNESS IS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN. FUNDING FOR WHOLE CRITICAL PERSON CARE PILOTS UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE SERVICES NEED TO BE INTEGRATED HOUSING HEALTH CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES ANSWER WE'RE LOOKING TO PILOT DIFFERENT WAYS ON BETTER WAYS TO DO THAT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRIORITIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION -- AT THE TOP IS YOU KNOW AS GOVERNOR YOU SOME SAID MAKING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM REAL ONCE MORE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE FOR WHOM THAT DREAM IS OUT OF REACH. THE REASON AREAS HOUSING COSTS AND WE KNOW UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE NEARLY ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA FALLS UNDER THAT POVERTY MEASURE AND A MAJOR REASON FOR THAT. IS HOUSING COSTS AND RUN BURDEN FAMILIES SO WE'RE PROPOSING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES -- FIRST WE KNOW THAT OUTSIDE OF OUR BY THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BONDS THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR THAT INCLUDES ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AS WELL AS A BILLION DOLLARS FOR VETERANS AND THEN ALSO THE BOND THAT I MENTIONED THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME BOND WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE HOUSING SIDE AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL PROVIDING A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING REVENUES FROM REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION FEES THAT'S A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO AND OUR AGENDA WE'RE PROPOSING A SHORT TERM INITIATIVE AND A LONGER TERM INITIATIVE. ON THE SHORT TERM WE'RE COMMITTED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS TO FLOW TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL HELP THEM. PLAN FOR INCREASING THEIR HOUSING SUPPLY THAT STAFFING THAT'S PLANNING THAT'S PERMITTING THAT'S REZONING AND IF THEY HIT THE MILESTONES THAT WE WORK WITH THEM TO LAY OUT THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP PUSH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE WE NEED THEM TO BE THE STATE'S PARTNERS IN SOLVING THIS HOUSING CRISIS. OVER THE LONG TERM PROPOSING TO REVISE THAT RENO GOALS WHICH IS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY REFLECT LOCAL INPUT. ARE TIED TO STATE GOALS IN ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT IS ROBUST AND THAT MAKES SENSE SO OUR DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WILL DEVELOP. A NEW PLAN TO MAKE THESE GOALS MAKE SENSE LOOK AT LOCAL INPUT FOR THEM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OVERTIME WILL ENFORCE THEM AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF COMMENTS. ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL THAT IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THIS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MONEY INCLUDING UNDER SP ONE MAY BE TIED TO MEETING THESE GOALS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN YOUR ONE OF THIS BUDGET IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN YOUR TO IT'S PART OF THIS LONGER TERM. PROCESS WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY JURISDICTION KNOWS WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO SOLVE WHAT IT'S BECOME A STATE WIDE CRISIS. AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNOR AS SEEN THIS PROBLEM UP EVERYONE NEEDS FOR THOSE THAT DON'T -- THE FUNDING MAY BE WITHHELD DOWN THE ROAD BUT WE HOPE TO GIVE THEM TIME SO THAT THEY CAN MEET THEIR GOALS. THAT THAT FUNDING CAN BE RESTORED SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WILL BE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE YEARS TO COME. WE ALSO INCLUDE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY THIS IS TO EXPAND THEIR MIXED INCOME LOAN PROGRAM ON TOP OF THE FORTY TRUCK FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR IN BACKING THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. AND WE'RE ALSO HOPING AS PART OF THAT DAD -- LABEL OUT PARTNER WE ARE THESE COMMITTEES WILL PARTNER WITH PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS INCLUDING COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY THAT CAN STEP UP AND MAKE INVESTMENTS OF THEIR OWN TO FURTHER EXPAND ACCESS TO MIXED INCOME HOUSING. WE SAW JUST THIS MORNING IN SEATTLE THAT MICROSOFT -- PUT IN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES OVER THERE -- AND CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM FEELS THERE'S NO REASON WHY OTHER COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT MAKE SIMILAR COMMITMENTS -- AND I SHOULD SAY FOR THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION -- I SHOULD SAY THAT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY ONE LAST PROPOSAL ON THIS FRONT IS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION. OF THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS UNDER THE 4% LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW MORE LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT 6280% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. TWO FINAL POINTS ALL MAKE ON HOUSING ONE IS THAT THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE AN INVENTORY OF ACCESS STATE PROPERTY WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO BEAT THESE PROPERTIES OUT TO DEVELOPERS ARE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THIS IS LAND. THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE ALREADY HAD IT COULD MAYBE IN PLACES WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING AND WE CAN SIMPLY BIT OUT OR TRANSFER THAT PROPERTY OVER. AND GET THAT HOUSING BILLS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THING I'LL POINT IS AS A SUCCESSOR TO REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED. THIS ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS THE ISD'S ALL RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ONLY THREE OF THEM IN THE STATE THERE'S A 55% THRESHOLD FOR VOTER APPROVAL FOR THE V. I. AFTER USED TO ISSUE TAX. WE PROPOSE REMOVING THAT THRESHOLD AND COMBINING THIS PROGRAM I'M SORRY NOT COMBINING BUT WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS PAIRED WITH OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT. ENHANCES INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS WE THINK THAT CAN BE A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO FOR MORE NBC IRAQIS TO PROMOTE REGIONAL PLANNING AND THEREFORE DEVELOP MORE HOUSING CAN THAT WAY AS WELL. I WANT TO TALK NOW ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- COMING OUT OF THESE FIRES IN NOVEMBER WE'RE PROPOSING FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE COMPETENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN WHEN THESE EMERGENCIES HAPPEN. THIRTY ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL. THREE YEARS FOR YOU COUNTY IN LAKE COUNTY AND A FULL YEAR HAVE PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL FOR ANY LOSSES INCURRED FOR ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE WILDFIRES THIS INCLUDES LA COUNTY. ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY -- AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL SHARE OF THAT PROPERTY TAX LOSS -- WILL ALREADY BE FILLED UNDER THE MATTRESS AND MECHANISM OF PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT WERE ALSO PROPOSING TO EXTEND AN AUTHORITY THAT EXPIRED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR FOR THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE TO TRANSFER MONEY FROM THE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGENCIES THIS INCIDENT ALREADY THAT THE DIRECTOR KILLY BOSS WORK HOW TO USE -- THIS LAST FALL AND WINTER AND WE WANT TO MAKE AUTHORITY AND THE NEXT EMERGENCY -- AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL COSTS OF OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY AND DEBRIS REMOVAL WE'RE FORECASTING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE -- WE'VE PASSED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A 100% COST YEAR FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL OF THEM. AFTER THE MOST RECENT PACKAGE THEY GAVE US -- IT WAS 90% AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY HARD WIRED INTO FEDERAL LEGISLATION -- MORE TRADITIONALLY -- SOMETIMES TO COST 75% 225% SO WE ARE ASSUMING IN OUR BUDGET -- THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF THOSE ESTIMATES FOR NOW THAT THE STATE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING UP 25% OF THE OVERALL COST -- I KNOW ON TWITTER THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT THERE NOT BEING ANY FEDERAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL FOLLOW THE LAW AND CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS. ALSO WHEN IT COMES THAT STATE COST SHARE USUALLY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO PICK UP WAVING THAT REQUIREMENT -- WE KNOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH THE FIRE AND THE STATE WILL PICK UP THE FULL SHARE AND THIS SHOULD SAVE THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MONEY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS BUDGET. THIS INCLUDES AN PGRADED NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM FINALLY COMPLETED EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING MONITORING SYSTEM AND AS WE KNOW IN EARTHQUAKES EVEN A COUPLE OF SECONDS CAN MAKE SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE -- USING OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN WHICH HELP EACH OTHER WITH RESOURCES TO PRE POSITION -- FIRE ENGINES AND OTHER RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT MERGING SEE AND THAT CAN COST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WERE ALSO PROPOSING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN BOTH SATEWIDE. AND GRANTS TO BUILD LOCAL RESILIENCY STEP PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES ARE AWARE BEFORE AN EMERGENCY OR OTHER DISASTER WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PREPARE FOR IT AND HOW THEY CAN WORK WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS. AND FINALLY WERE PROPOSING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE HAD -- PUBLIC PROPERTY DAMAGE MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP THEM RESTORE REPAIR SOME OF THAT DAMAGE. AND THEN I WANT TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON WILD FIRES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT SO MANY OF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT -- THE PACKAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS OUTLINED -- WHEN ALL'S PUT TOGETHER IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST IN PREPAREDNESS -- PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ON TO INCLUDE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FUEL REDUCTION IN OUR FORESTS AND THAT WAS OUT OF THE BILL THAT I KNOW MANY OF YOU VOTED ON LAST YEAR MAKING SURE THAT THAT FUNDING STATES FLOWING FOR THIS YEAR. IT ALSO INCLUDES OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW HELICOPTERS TO REPLACE MANY OF THE CAR HELICOPTERS THAT WERE USING THAT DATE BACK TO THE VIETNAM WAR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO -- AND THEN ALSO THE U. S. AIR FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THE C. ONE THIRTY AIRPLANES TO CALIFORNIA TO HELP USED TO COMBAT WILDFIRES NEAR TRANSFERRING THOSE TO US THEM.

WE ALSO INCLUDE IN JUST ADDING MORE YOUR ADDING MORE CREWS TEN MILLION NO IN INVESTMENTS IN NEW CAMERAS TO FIRE SMALL SENSING TECHNOLOGY. AND FINALLY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST TO ENSURE THAT WE LOOK OUT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. THESE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE FIGHTING THESE FIRES OFTEN GOING WITHOUT SLEEP WITHOUT BREAKS -- THEY'RE SAYING TERRIBLE THINGS UP CLOSE WITH THESE FIRES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED -- AND WE ALSO INCLUDE NEW INVESTMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IMPLEMENTING THE FORCED RECORDER AND YOU INVESTMENTS IN RADIO INTEROPERABLE IT SO WE KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL WORK WITH YOU BUT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PREVENTION AND RESPONSE.

A COUPLE QUICK POINTS ON PUBLIC SAFETY -- OUR PRISON POPULATION FOR THE STATE IS JUST A SHADE UNDER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING PAROLEES AS SMALL AS YOU TWO ARE INCARCERATED. WE HAVE MADE OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS A BIG INVESTMENT REHABILITATIVE SERVICES IN FACT THAT BUDGET THE SPENDING ON REHABILITATIVE SERVICES COMPARED TO TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN LEVEL. IS A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT WHAT IT WAS BACK THEN WERE ALSO INCLUDING ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR LITERACY PROGRAMS INCLUDING TRAINING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AS LITERACY COACHES TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE. IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR TATTOO REMOVAL. TO HELP PEOPLE I SHOULD THEY WISH TO REMOVE TACK TO SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER GET JOBS ON THE OUTSIDE -- WE ALSO INCLUDE NEW FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR PRISONS WE PROPOSE AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED MOVING OUR DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY.

WE ALSO INCLUDE ON THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING THIS IS THE POST COMMISSION -- TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE PERMANENT ONE TIME FINDING AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR RESTORATION FOR FUNDING FOR DE SCALATION AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN THE SPORTY SITUATIONS THAT.

FOR THE ARMS PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM A SOME YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS FUNDING INITIALLY CAME OUT OF THE TRUSTEE THAT'S THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE ON FIREARMS PURCHASES.

FOR A NEW OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THIS WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY I'VE.

TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS THAT REALLY NEED HELP IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BRINGING AND THE BEST TALENT IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT. TO HELP US DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WERE ALL WERE ALSO PROPOSING STARTING IN INNOVATION ACADEMY BUT SENIOR LEADERS ACROSS GOVERNMENT AND ALL DEPARTMENTS CAN GO TO FOR TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSE. RIPPLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A BIG STATE GOVERNMENT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES SO WE THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE OUT TO USE THE WORD THAT THE GOVERNOR USES A LOT A LOT OF INTENTIONALITY -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CHANGES CO ALTER THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT OF THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE'S WRITTEN ACTUALLY A BOOK ABOUT THIS -- BASED ON HIS TIME AS MAYOR AND WHERE HE BELIEVES GOVERNMENT CAN GO IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY BEING EASY TO WORK WITH AND TO DEAL WITH CITIZEN BILL HE POINTS OUT THAT IT'S COMING OUT IN THE NEW EDITION -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WILL BE. I ALREADY -- GOING FORWARD. THREE LAST POINTS ON GOVERNMENT WERE INCLUDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CENSUS WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT THE CENSUS. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR BUDGET WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET PEOPLE COUNTED.

INCREASING ENROLLMENT IN THIS PROGRAM FOR NEW AMERICORPS MEMBERS AND ALSO EXPANDING THE SIEGEL EDUCATION AWARD THAT MEMBERS RECEIVE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR SERVICE WHICH THEY CAN APPLY TO THEIR DEBT REPAYMENTS OR FOR ONGOING EDUCATION. SO THAT'S THE BUDGET -- ONE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO EARLY ACTIONS IN THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SEVERAL OF YOUR STAFFERS WITH AND WILL BE WE WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU IN THE MONTHS TO COME BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL ITEMS WERE WE PROPOSE. ACTUALLY MOVING EARLIER AND PUTTING SOME OF THESE ITEMS INTO THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND PERHAPS EVEN ACTING ON THESE WITH YOUR CONCURRENCE WITH IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS. AND LET ME LIVE IN OUT RIGHT NOW FIRST ARE UPGRADES TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS IN A STATE OF UTMOST RELIABILITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SECOND IS SOME OF THE FUNDING I OUTLINED FOR THE IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE FUND BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE CHALLENGES ARE ON GOING. THIRD IS THE FUNDING FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING WHERE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT.

AND THAT THERE'S NO DIVIDE. AND THEN THE SECOND AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED RECENT ON CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY ON AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE PROPOSING SOME LANGUAGE TO THAT KIND AS WELL. I'LL CONCLUDE TWO FINAL POINTS -- THE FIRST AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING IS THIS BUDGET IS WAS DEVELOPED OVER NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IT WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY TENTH WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS WILL CHANGE. THAT ARE CONDITIONS WILL CHANGE WE HAVE TO MONITOR THE SHUT DOWN IN WASHINGTON DC -- SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE UPDATING AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU. AS OUR NUMBERS ARE JOSH TO OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE BACK IN MAY WITH ITS REVISED BUDGET -- AND THEN THE SECOND THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TO PRESENT THE BUDGET I'VE REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF JOE STEFFAN SHOT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL AND GETTING US ACCLIMATED GIVEN THAT WERE ON DAY EIGHT OR NINE OFTHIS ADMINISTRATION -- AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT ALL OF US CAN BE PRODUCT SO THANK YOU. SERVICE ONE OF FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET A COLLEAGUE FROM ASKED WE HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL WE HEAR FROM THE LA JOH. AND THEN -- YOU CAN DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO THE PROPER PERSON. WELCOME MISS CHIU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU THAT ALL WALK WALK THROUGH THAT WE ALSO HAVE OUR PUBLICATION OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT THE HAND OUT LARGELY -- TAKES FROM -- THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN SOME DETAIL SO I'M GONNA FOCUS TODAY ON OUR HIGH LEVEL ASSESSMENT -- OF THE DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES AVAILABLE OUR INITIAL TAKE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR PROPOSALS AND THEN PROVIDE SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE BRIDGE AT STRUCTURE. I'LL JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF SOME OF THESE MAJOR PROPOSALS AND THAT WE HAVE MUCH WORK IN THE COMING WEEKS -- TO PROVIDE YOU ASSISTANCE AS YOU REVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN ASSESSING WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED LOOKING AT THE TRAILER BILL THAT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND FALLING UNDER FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE PROPOSALS. TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE THIS CHURCH SHOWS THE BREAKDOWN OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- DISTRIBUTION OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES WE DO A BOTTOMS UP TALLYING OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR HAD AT HIS DISCRETION TO ALLOCATE IN THE BUDGET. WITH UNDER OUR ESTIMATES THAT IS TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL SPENDING REQUIREMENTS CHANGES IN CASELOAD PROGRAM COSTS AND NEW LEGISLATION. YOU'LL NOTE THAT THIS IS ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE DISCRETIONARY -- SURPLUS THAT WE ESTIMATED IN NOVEMBER AND AS WAS ALREADY REFERENCE IS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER THAN ESTIMATED COSTS IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. ABOUT HALF. OF THESE DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED TO ONE TIME DOT RELATED SPENDING A QUARTER TO ONE TIME FOR DRAMATIC SPENDING AND THEN THE REMAINDER SPLIT ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN DISCRETIONARY RESERVES AN ONGOING SPENDING. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE THIS TABLE SUMMARIZES THE MAJOR OP PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SAID THE BUDGET SO EXCLUDING FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN SCHOOLS -- JUST TO TOUCH ON THAT QUICKLY THE LARGEST PROPOSAL I WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE IS TO PROVIDE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. A ROUGHLY THREE POINT 5% -- COLA ADJUSTMENT -- AND TO FIND -- THOSE GRADE FUNDING RATES. SO GOING THROUGH THE CHART FIRST ON THE DAYTON LIABILITY IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WILL BE EXACT EXAMINING IN THE COMING MONTHS -- IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON THAT MY ABILITIES IS WHETHER OR NOT THESE WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE THE LARGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IN TERMS OF FUTURE SAVINGS. WE ALSO WOULD KNOW THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE ESTIMATES FOR THE SAVINGS ON PAYMENTS THE PENSION PLANS THAT WE WOUD FOCUS ON THE NET SAVINGS THAT THESE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS -- COULD PROVIDE AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL MODELING FROM THE PENSION SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE SAVINGS. THAT THESE PAYMENTS COULD MAKE IT COULD NOT PROVIDE. SO ANOTHER ITEM ON EARLY EDUCATION AS A WAS ALREADY MENTIONED IS THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION AND TURN IT LEAST IN ITS EARLY PHASES WHAT TARGET CHILDREN -- WHO THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS BENEFITS THE MOST BENEFIT THE MOST FROM -- THIS TYPE OF EARLY EDUCATION LOW INCOME CHILDREN. THE EARLY OTHER EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS KINDERGARTEN FACILITY IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES THESE ARE LARGELY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT WE HOPE TO KNOW MORE ONCE THE TRAILER BILL IS RELEASED. THE GOVERNOR TAKES A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE UNIVERSITIES AND PROVIDING ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS IN THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AS WAS ALREADY NOTED THE AUGMENTATIONS -- OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUR FOR SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES -- AND PRIORITIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION WE THINK TARGETING THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SPECIFIC -- EXPECTATIONS FROM FROM THE LEDGE WE TOOK A MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION AND BETTER FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S. IN TERMS OF THE CAL WORKS AUGMENTATION -- THE CAL WORKS AUGMENTATION TAKES A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE LAID OUT IN ITS INTENT LANGUAGE LAST YEAR. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE STATED THAT THAT IT IS IT'S GOAL OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE CAL WORKS GRANT LEVELS REACH 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THE POWER GRANT LEVELS LEVEL BUT ONLY FOR A FAMILY OF THREE FOR ALL OTHER FAMILY SIZES IT WOULD REPRESENT A THREE POINT INCREASE THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THIRTEEN POINT 1% -- GRANT INCREASE -- TO TO THOSE FAMILIES. AS WAS ALREADY NOTED -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO MAINTAIN THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 7% SERVICE -- INCREASE DESPITE NOT -- MAINTAINING THE MCO TAX. UNDER CURRENT LAW THOSE THOSE TWO ARE TIED TOGETHER. AND THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES -- TO THE BOB BUDGET PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO WITH FOR THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. THESE CHANGES -- WEAR DRESS WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE CURRENT ISSUES AND HOW THAT PROGRAM IS FUNDED THE LOCAL LEVEL HOW -- COUNTIES RECEIVE FUNDING TO PAY FOR THEIR SHARE OF COSTS BUT AT LEAST BASED ON OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT IT DOES LOOK LIKE COUNTY IS. COSTS WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS THROUGH THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT THEY CURRENTLY PROVIDE RECEIVE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. I'M MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE HEALTH CARE ISSUES WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- THE PENALTY THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE MANDATE PENALTY AND THE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BOTTOM LINE BUDGET. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR ESTIMATES THAT THERE WOULD BE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH AND REVENUES FROM THESE PENALTIES THAT. I'VE DONE AT LEAST BASED BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE WE DON'T YET HAVE DETAIL ON HOW THE PENALTY REVENUE -- X. WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED FOR THE SUBSIDIES BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- IN. THE PENALTY REVENUE AND THE SUBSIDIES ARE CONFLICTING GOALS OVER TIME IF THE PENALTY IS EFFECTIVE REVENUE SHOULD DECLINE BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE. SIGNING UP FOR COVERAGE ON WHICH COULD CAUSE SUBSIDIES -- TO DECLINE OVER TIME AS WELL UNLESS THEY ARE GOING TO BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND. IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROPOSAL IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INITIAL PLAN IS TO DRIVE DOWN SOME OF THE RESERVE WITHIN THE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND -- BUT AGAIN THERE'S NOT DIRECT FUNDING FOR THAT PLAN WITHIN WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED. MOVING TO HOUSING -- THE TAX CREDIT EXPANSION THAT WAS SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S DOES NOT EXPECT WILL BE UTILIZED WITHIN THEIR BUDGET WINDOW -- WHILE THERE IS THIS FIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION WE DON'T SEE -- ANY CHANGES IN REVENUES -- WITHIN THE THE BUDGET WINDOW OF OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MEANING THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BE CLAIMED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- ALSO RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH POPULATIONS THE LEGISLATURE LIKE TO TARGET FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE. ROUGHLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE RECEIVE SOME FORM OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE. THERE SIMPLY IS NOT CURRENTLY SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO PROVIDE EVERY LOW INCOME PERSON IN IN THE STATE WITH THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES ALLOCATE IS A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF FUNDING. TO HIRE SOMEONE THERE ARE RELATIVELY HIGHER INCOME LEVELS AND THIS JUST RAISES A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHO IT WOULD LIKE TO TARGET WITH THESE LIMITED RESOURCES. ON DISASTERS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- RAISES SOME SOME QUESTIONS -- FIRST WHAT FUNDING SOURCE TO USE FOR SOME ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL USES GENERAL FUND. FOR SOME ITEMS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN PAID -- BY SPECIAL FUNDS LIKE THE NINE ONE ONE OUR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND WHAT TYPES AND HOW SUSTAINABLE LOCAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS -- TO THESE -- COMMUNITIES AFFECTED -- MAYBE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SINCE STATE ASSISTANCE. AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY SIMPLY WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE OVER TIME IN TERMS OF PROPERTY TAX BACK FILLS WHAT COMMUNITIES MIGHT WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THESE WILD FIRES -- AND WHAT COMMUTE WHAT TYPES OF COMMITTEES MADE ME LONGER ASSISTANT A LONGER PERIODS OF ASSISTANCE SIR COVER. LASTLY ON THIS PAGE -- WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND -- SPLITTING THE TAX PROPOSALS AND CONSIDERING THEM SEPARATELY -- THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS ONE THAT IS HARD HAS BEEN HARD FOR THE STATE TO ESTIMATE WITH US SOME LEVEL OF ACCURACY IN TERMS OF THE TAKE UP AND THE COSTS OVER TIME. SIMILARLY THE COOKIE ANY CONFORMITY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AFFECTS ON REVENUES THAT MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AND HEARING THESE TWO POLICY PROPOSALS TOGETHER. PRESENTS CHALLENGES -- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ARRIVE AT A NET NEUTRAL REVENUE NEUTRAL -- PACKAGE. TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT JUST SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUTSIDE LANDS MANY BUDGET PART POLICY PRIORITIES EARLY AND MANY OF THEM ARE IN KEEPING WITH RECENT LEGISLATIVE ACTION. THIS PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE KEY OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO FORM ITS OWN VIEW OF WHAT THESE POLICY SHOULD BE OVER THE COMING MONTHS. WE WERE NOTE THAT THE ONGOING COSTS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH ARE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT GROWING TO THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- IN THE IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE ASKED ALL UNDER OUR NOVEMBER ESTIMATES BUT THERE ARE AREAS WHERE COST TO GROW FOR INSTANCE MANY OF THE ITEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IN HIS BUDGET FOR DISASTER MITIGATION OR COVERING RELIEF -- ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE BUT THEY ARE THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE ONGOING COSTS FOR THE STATE. GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND THE SEVERITY OF DISASTERS OF THE STATE IS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. ALSO JUST NOTE -- AS WAS BROUGHT UP THAT THE AUTHORITY. TO TRANSFER FUNDS OUT OF THE SFE YOU TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS IS SOMETHING HAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO RENEW -- RATHER QUICKLY IN THIS I THINK IS A KEY AREA OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE TRANSFERS THAT MAY HAPPEN AND THE TYPES OF BUDGET RESIST SIR RESILIENCY QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER OF OF HOW TO FIND THOSE TYPES OF TRANSFERS THERE IS. A VERY LARGE TRANSFER AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT I THINK RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE. THE ABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAP IMMEDIATE BASIS BUT THEN ALSO KEEPS THE STATE'S RESERVES INTACT. ON THE THIS BUDGET DOES. ALLOCATE A SMALLER SHARE OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TO RESERVES THEM PRIOR BUDGETS. ON NET DISCRETIONARY RESERVES WOULD BE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- BUT THAT SAID -- THEY DO TAKE A NEW INTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION TWO WHICH NECESSITATES I ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR TRANSFERRED TO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT. A CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING THAT TRIP TAKING THIS INTERPRETATION AND MAKING THAT TRANSFER TO THE BSA. IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES THERE WOULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING IN THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR WINDOW. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR -- AS PER THE BUDGET PACKAGE ADOPTED A PLAN FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING THAT IT ANTICIPATED STARTING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY CONCEPT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEW INTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION TWO IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT PLAN. WHILE THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT DEDICATE -- A HIGHER SHARE OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TO RESERVES -- THE PAIN OUT OF DEBT AND LIABILITIES DOES DO IMPROVE THE BUDGETS BOTTOM LINE AND REDUCE COSTS IN THE LONG TERM -- ONE THING TO NOTE HOWEVER  <u>I</u> JUST IN TERMS OF BUDGET RESILIENCY THE CHANGES TO THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS DO PRISON FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DO PRESENTS SOME QUESTIONS. ABOUT HOW CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE -- WILL BE DEALT WITH WHEN WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN CURRENT THE CURRENT YEAR. ODD -- TO ADJUST THE GUARANTEE UP OR DOWN -- AND WHETHER WHO WILL BEAR THE COSTS WHETHER IT'S THE NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET OR THE NON NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET. AS YOUR CALL THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS -- WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ADOPTED AT RATHER COMPLEX MECHANISM TO DEAL WITH. OVER AND UNDER APPROPRIATIONS OF THE GUARANTEE OVERTIME -- WHILE WE'RE ON SCHOOLS ARE JUST TWO THINGS TO NOTE THE FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE. A VERY LARGE QUESTION WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THAT IS IT DOES NOT ALLOCATE VERY MUCH MONEY TO ONE TIME SPENDING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT QUESTION WITHIN THE NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE PROTECTING SCHOOLS FROM YEAR TO YEAR FLUCTUATIONS SUCH THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAMS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE IS NOT A VERY LARGE QUESTION AT ALL. THE SECOND THING I WOULD NOTE ABOUT SCHOOLS IS THAT TO DATE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DEPOSIT INTO THE SCHOOLS RESERVE ACCOUNT. CONSEQUENTLY SHOWED A DOWNTURN CON. THERE IS NOT A DEDICATED STATEWIDE SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR SCHOOLS CURRENTLY THIS COULD PUT PRESSURE ON ANY WITHDRAWALS FROM THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT -- FOR SCHOOL SPENDING. LASTLY I'LL TOUCH ON REVENUES ARE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE OUT YEARS VERY SIMILAR. THAT SAID WE AND THE ADMINISTRATION PUT TOGETHER OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES PRIOR TO THE DOWNTURN IN THE MARKET AT THE VERY END OF LAST YEAR. THIS POSES SOME REST. UNDER OUR ESTIMATES AND UNDER THE CURRENT CONSENSUS OF PROFESSIONAL ECONOMISTS IF THE STOCK MARKET STAYS AT ITS ROUGHLY CURRENT LEVEL AND GROW SOMEWHAT SLOWLY OVER THE CURRENT YEAR. WE BELIEVE THE REVENUE LOSS COULD BE ABOUT ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT HOWEVER IS SOMETHING THAT LIKELY COULD BE ABSORBED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL WERE SPENDING REQUIREMENTS. LARGELY UNDER PROPOSITION TWO AND WITH SOME REDUCTIONS IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. THAT SAID IF THE LOSSES TURN OUT TO BE LARGER THERE IS INCREASED RISK AND THE THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL SPENDING APARTMENTS NO LONGER WOULD BE ABLE TO ABSORB. THOSE REDUCTIONS AND THERE WOULD BE IMPACTS OF THE BUDGET BOTTOM LINE. THAT'S THE END OF MY COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- BOTH OF YOU I SEE LET ME JUST ACKNOWLEDGE WHO I SEE I SEE SENATOR RON [inaudible] MISS LEYVA [inaudible] IT [inaudible] MISTER BELL [inaudible] ZERO TAMARA. BEFORE WE GET STARTED LISTENING TO ROCK IF I COULD JUST ASK VERY QUICKLY AND I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT TO START WITH THE ONE AS TO MENTION THERE ARE -- ONE UNIQUE ASPECT OF THE BUDGET ARE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW POLICY PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED EARLY -- SOME MAJOR SHIFT SOME VERY NEW PER SHOULD WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THOSE BRAND NEW PROPOSALS I'M THINKING. CASE IN POINT -- DJJ TRANSFERRED TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT WILL REQUIRE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE SHOULD WE EXPECT TO SEE THE DETAILS IN THE MAY REVISE. WILL THEY COME OUT AND TREAT THE BILL LANGUAGE TO TELL US WHAT. YOU ANTICIPATE STRUCTURALLY WE WILL SEE MORE OF THE MEAT ON THE BONES OF SOME OF THESE MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS AND POLICIES YES. YES SO FOR SOME OF THESE BIGGER ONES AND REALLY LIKE THAT ONE AND HOMES OR WITH PID FAMILY LEAVE -- I THINK WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS TO REALLY GET TO THE DETAILS OF NUNS ALSO PRETTY CURRENT PAY FAMILIES GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF USE OKAY SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE WORKING OUT THE DETAILS AND THOSE WILL BE READY ON FEBRUARY FIRST. BUT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING OF THESE NEW VERY BIG TICKET LONG TERM INITIATIVES WE EXPECT THAT THAT WILL TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS AS WELL. EXCELLENT OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'LL START WITH SENATOR ROUGH. THANK YOU VENTURE -- MISTER OF HIS WILL OFTEN DID I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY. IT'S BETTER THAN OUR SHOES. FIRST LET ME OF COMPLIMENTS YOU THAT SERVE MY BEEN DOING THIS BUDGET STUFF FOR SIX YEARS THAT'S THE MOST DETAILED BUDGET OVERVIEW I THINK WE'VE HAD IN SIX YEARS AND UP WHILE IT WAS A FIRE HOSE -- IT WAS AS MUCH APPRECIATED. I HAVE -- MAYBE THREE QUICK QUESTIONS I WASN'T GOING TO ASK ONE ON EDUCATION BECAUSE I FIGURED WE'D HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE SOME CLOSE CONVERSATION ON THAT LATER BUT WHITE WINE NO DEPOSIT INTO THE SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. YES SO -- I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS -- ON MY TEAM. BASICALLY UNDER PROPOSITION TWO THERE IS THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THEN THE SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT -- IT'S TO THE BUDGET BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THOSE ARE THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. FOR THE SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT -- DEPOSITS ARE ONLY REQUIRED -- WHEN A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS ARE MET AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE NEED A NUMBER OF THOSE CONDITIONS THIS YEAR SO UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHTS THREE TESTS WE HAVE TO BE IN A TEST ONE YEAR WHICH MEANS THAT? THE AMOUNT COMING OUT OF STATE BUDGET IS A SET PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE. RATHER THAN NECESSARILY ADJUSTING FOR PERSONAL INCOME GROWTH OR GENERAL FUND REVENUE GROWTH -- SO WE ARE IN A TEST ONE YEAR -- WE ALSO ELIMINATED ALL OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE FACTOR PRIOR TO THE YEARS TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT WAS ALSO A REQUIREMENT. UNDER PROPOSITION -- TWO BUT THE ONE TEST THAT WE HAVEN'T MET YET IS THAT THE PROPOSITION ONE LEVEL HAS TO BE HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSITION TWO LEVEL BY GETTING THAT RIGHT JESSICA. YEAH SO THAT'S THE TEST THAT'S NOT NOT THIS YEAR AND THE WAY COLLATION WORKS WHICH IS BASED ON THE GROWTH AND PERSONAL INCOME -- ITS FIRST WEIGHED AGAINST TEST THREE WHICH IS BASED ON THE GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES. DONE TAKE THE LOWER OF THOSE TWO TESTS AND PUT IT UP AGAINST TEST ONE WHICH IS OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE -- SO IT TURNS OUT THAT IN THIS YEAR OUR TEST ONE LEVEL IS HIGHER THAN -- THAT TEST THREE LEVEL BUT LOWERED SOME SORRY. AM I GETTING THIS RIGHT HIGHER THAN THE TEST THREE LEVEL BUT STILL LOWER THAN THE TEST TO LEVEL SO FOR THOSE REASONS NO DEPOSIT IS MANDATED. NOW YOU COULD ARGUE -- SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSITS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST FOR PROPOSITION TWO WHICH WE ARE NOW CHARACTERIZING AS MORE OPTIONAL -- YOU COULD ARGUE WE CAN MAKE AN OPTIONAL DEPOSIT INTO THIS ACCOUNT IN THIS YEAR AND THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE OFFERED THE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE -- RECESSION I THINK WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THAT DETERMINE A WE FOR NOW IS THAT SCHOOLS EVEN WITH THIS MAJOR INCREASE IN K. TWELVE FUNDING. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ARE STILL UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES -- SO THERE IS AN EMPHASIS RIGHT NOW AND GETTING AL THOSE FUNDS INTO THE HANDS OF SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW WE ARE AWARE THAT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH INCREASING THE BASE. BASE LEVEL GRANT AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT FINDS ACT THAT MINIMUM GUARANTEE LEVEL -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT ARE THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO CAL STIRS WHILE OUTSIDE OF THE BASS GRANT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE TUNE OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THEM I HAVE TO HOPEFULLY QUICK QUESTIONS ON HEALTH CARE SINCE I WILL NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO VISIT WITH YOU IN A SUBCOMMITTEE ON THIS YOU MENTIONED CHANGES TO THE MECHANISM. BY WHICH THE STATE PROVIDES COUNTIES WITH AYE HSS FUNDING AND THAT THIS MAN MIGHT. HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO MOVE MORE MONEY TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS YOU MAY KNOW WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH WITH SEVERAL FUNDING DISPARITIES IN THE STATE BUT CERTAINLY A MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING DISPARITY IN THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. WHICH WAS BASED ON POPULATION AND CASELOADS AND THERE'S THIS WAS A THIRD FACTOR BACK THEN. WERE THE FUNDING IN THE COASTAL URBAN AREAS -- AS TENDED TO REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH BUT AS THE POPULATION SHIFTS IN THE CASELOAD INCREASES IN THE INLAND AREAS NORTH CENTRAL AND SOUTH. THE FUNDING ALLOCATION IS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE WITH THE POPULATION IN CASE OF GROWTH. WILL THIS -- READING REALIGNMENT SO TO SPEAK OF IHS FUNDING I JUST AS FUNDING -- ALLOW US -- TO RE VISIT THE ALLOCATION FORMULAS FOR THE NEW MONEY THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE USED BY COUNTIES. FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LET ME DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT ALLOCATION. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION SIR. JACOB FOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THAT. THE THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO I JUST SAYS IS NOT PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE ALLOCATIONS AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE -- PLEASE -- MEANING. THERE'S THERE'S STILL BASED ON THE ORIGINAL -- UP PERCENTAGES THAT WERE SET BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- THAT IS A CONVERSATION WHERE WERE OPEN TO I THINK IT IT DEFINITELY WILL REQUIRE -- LOTS OF INPUT FROM FROM THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES -- BUT BUT OUR PROPOSAL. ESSENTIALLY BY BY -- A REDUCING THE MOE. WHAT IT DOES IS IT FREES UP REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ADDITIONAL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS -- COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM INCLUDING GROSS MONEY INCLUDING GROWTH MONEY THAT'S CORRECT WELL I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS BUT I'LL ASK MY COLLEAGUES WHO HEARS THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PERHAPS. TO EXPLORE THIS A GROWTH FACTOR IN THE IN THE FUTURE AND MAYBE YOU ALL CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. A LESLIE YOU MENTIONED THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN AS PART OF GENERALLY SPEAKING AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL -- AND AS YOU MAY KNOW -- OUR CALIFORNIA SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND SOME IF NOT MANY OTHERS. HAVE BEEN RELYING ON A FEDERAL THREE FORTY B. WAIVER UTILIZING THE DELTA BETWEEN DISCOUNTED DRUG PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENTS. OF FOR OPERATIONAL FUNDING AND IT IS NOT IN SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY -- HAVE YOU OR WILL YOU EXPLORE OF THE IMPACT OF THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSAL ON THE USE OF THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. TO CERTAINLY OUR SAFETY NET HOSPITALS IF NOT OTHERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE YES NO ABSOLUTELY AND NO THAT IS CORRECT THAT WE ARE WE HAVE A DIANNE COMMENTS IS A SPECIAL ADVISER IN OUR OFFICE HAS FLAG IT FOR ALL OF US YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT IT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE SAVE ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- THAT THE SAVINGS DON'T HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE SAFETY NET HOSPITALS SO ON THE PROPOSAL'S NHIAU YOU KNOW WAS ANNOUNCED EIGHT OR NINE DAYS AGO -- SO WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING EXACTLY HOW IT WILL WORK IN A LOT F THE DETAILS BUT THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS TOP OF MIND FOR US BUT WE HAVE AN EXPERT IS THE CHAIR THAT PARTICULAR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I'M SURE HE'LL DELVE INTO IT I JUST WANTED. TO TO STICK MY SMALL OR IN THE WATER ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM SURE THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA WHO'LL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS THIS IS MY FIRST -- BUDGET MEETING SO I'M NOT SURE WHO MY CORE -- QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED -- TO BUT IT'S UNDER HIGHER EDUCATION AND UNDER THE STUDENT. I'M WONDERING WHY AT THE UC'S THEY THE BUDGET PROPOSES FIFTEEN MILLION OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND MONEY. TO AUGMENT THEIR EFFORTS. BUT THE C. ISSUES ARE ONLY GOING TO GET A FIFTH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME -- GENERAL FUND ASSISTANCE. CHRISTY. WAS CERTAINLY CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE. PART SO WHEN THE TWO SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN AT THEIR PROPOSALS -- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INDICATED A WHAT A WANTON DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING ONGOING IN THIS AREA WHERE'S THE CSU HAD INDICATED. A REQUEST FOR ONE TIME FUNDING AND THAT'S REALLY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. ARE THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS ON UNDER THE JUNE JUDICIAL BRANCH. AND IT HAS TO DO. WITH FUNDING FOR RAPE KITS -- LAST YEAR. WEN WE -- INTRODUCED SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WHICH WOULD HAVE TESTED ALL RAPE KITS GOING FORWARD THE COST WAS SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND FOUR MILLION GOING FORWARD. I WAS WONDERING IF THE FIRST YEAR WAS TO BUY A QUICK MINUTE AND THAT'S WHY THAT YOU'RE WAS HIGHER IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT INCLUDES FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION TO PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT WILL DO AND IS THERE MONEY TO MAKE SURE THE RAPE KITS ARE ACTUALLY TESTED. SO I DON'T HAVE THE DETAIL ON THAT WITH ME -- BUT I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL HELP. THE AMAZON WITH PERMANENT FINANCE SO LAST YEAR IN -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BUDGET WE HAD I THINK IT WAS FIVE POINT SIX MILLION FOR A ONE TIME PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT -- AND THIS YEAR IN DOJ'S BUDGET WE HAVE FIVE POINT EIGHT ONGOING -- TO PURCHASE -- EQUIPMENT IT WAS YOU KNOW WE WERE WAITING FOR A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FROM THEM -- AND SO WE HAVE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THAT THERE IS MONEY IN THERE -- FOR GREAT K?T TESTING AS WELL RELATED -- TO THE TWO BILLS THAT WERE PASSED LAST YEAR AND THEN ALSO -- I'D BACK FULL FOR THE DNA FUND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE PASSING US SEXUAL OR NOT PASSING A PROCESSING SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. I AM AWARE OF THE ONE BILL THAT PASSED AND THAT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE BILL -- TO MAKE SURE WE TEST WE FIND OUT THE BACKLOG MY BILL TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T EVER GET A BACKLOG BEFORE WAS VETOED SOME WONDER WHAT THE SECOND BILL IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M SORRY -- I THINK THAT'S OKAY IN THE BUDGET -- FOR THE EIGHTY THREE ONE ONE EIGHT RIGHT. AND THEN. MOVE AM I SORRY SORRY I GOT IT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE FINE WE CAN GET FURTHER IN DOCTOR BILL YEAH HOW GOOD THAT IS YEAH I DID. THERE'S A LADY THAT WE DID. TO ULTIMATELY WHAT I UNDERSTOOD WAS THERE'S MONEY IN THIS YEAR FOR PURCHASES OF EQUIPMENT AND TESTING. ON THAT WAS YOUR QUESTION YES IT WAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTIONS MA'AM CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE LA ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE FISCAL OUTLOOK THAT THEY PROVIDED. FOR US IN THE FALL IS ALREADY CHANGING AND LOWERING IT BY ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING THINGS IN THE ECONOMY. APPLE STOCK PRICES ARE GOING DOWN WE'RE SEEING A INVERTED YIELD CURVE SINGLE AT SIGNALS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS -- HI AS YOU LOOK AT MAYBE SCALING DOWN IF YOU NEED TO YOUR PROPOSED BUDGET BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY GOING OUT HERE. AND IN THE HOW HOW DO YOU SCALE IT DOWN YOU GO LIKE 10% EACH CATEGORY -- HERE'S PROGRAM A THAT WE'RE GONNA DROP BABY DO IT ANY YEAR TO OUR PROGRAM BE IS GONNA BE ELIMINATED DO YOU HAVE A A PRIORITY SYSTEM. SO NOT A DIRECT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE BE WILL BE WATCHING FOR OTHER THEN YOU KNOW CLOSELY MONITORING IN JANUARY IS A BIG. CASH MONTH AND IT'S IT'S HARD TO COMPARE THIS LAST DECEMBER TO THE PREVIOUS DECEMBER BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL TAX LAW A LOT OF PEOPLE PREPAID THEIR PRIOR YOUR TAXES IN. DECEMBER SO THE DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN REVENUES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL BE WATCHING THE CASH SITUATION. THIS CLOSELY I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE A HIGHER THIS POINT THE ONE THING THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT WHICH I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL THESE BIG PROPOSALS BUT THEY ARE IN THESE ONE TIME AN ON GOING SPENDINGS. SO ANY CHANGE IN THE REVENUE PICTURE WERE ALSO AS WE UPDATE OUR FORECAST CAN TRY TO GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF THAT NEEDS TO BE REDUCTIONS IN A ONE TIME. VERSUS HOW MUCH NEEDS TO BE ANY CHANGES IN THESE ONGOING CATEGORIES THAT ARE THESE BROADER COMMITMENTS IN THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO HEAR BACK BECAUSE THAT CASCADES OVER MANY YEARS. ACT IT'S GREAT TO BRING IT ALL OUT BILL I JUST GET NERVOUS GOING OKAY WORK WHERE DOES IT GO AS WE GET. HARD DATA -- WE'RE GETTING HARD DATA RIGHT NOW FOR THE SCHOOL SO I APPRECIATE THE LA -- POINTING OUT THAT WE'RE NOT FINDING THE PROP TO AMOUNT. FOR THE FOR THE FIND IN YOUR WRITING GIVING ALL THE FORMULAS -- BUT WE'RE YOU'VE TAKEN OUT AT AN OPINION SAYING WE COULD FIND MORE. THEN THE MANDATED AMOUNT IN THE GENERAL FUND RESERVES. AB THE AND YOU DO YOU CAN YOU ARE YOU COVERED THE AT THAT THE QUESTION REALLY WELL BUT SHOULD WE BE DOING -- A A LOT CHANGED TO CHANGE THE FORMULA SO THAT THERE'S MORE FOR THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE GOT L. U. S. D. WE'VE GOT SACRAMENTO CITY -- IN I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE FOR THE FISCAL CRISIS AN ASSISTANT MANAGEMENT TEAM OUT OF KERN COUNTY THAT WOULD JUMP INTO A SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO HELP OUT BUT THEY'RE READY. AT SACRAMENTO CITY IN THEIR AT SWEET WATER DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AND I'M JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON LAUSD AND THEN HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FINANCE ALL THAT. SO I'LL MAKE ONE OR TWO COMMENTS IN AND OUT JESSICA SHOULD CHIME IN AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS YOU KNOW AS WE WERE DISCUSSING WHEN THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS COME FROM THAT ACCOUNT THOSE ARE WITHIN. PROPOSITION -- NINETY EIGHT AND SO THIS YEAR GIVEN ALL THE PRESSURES THAT TO MAKE SURE ALL THE MY NINETY EIGHT MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOLS -- THAT CAL STIRS ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OUTSIDE THE GUARANTEE -- AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD PUT MONEY AND ARE OUTSIDE OF THE GUARANTEE BUT AS YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT GROWING RISKS -- RAISING THE BASE OF THE GUARANTEE ANY YEAR LIKE THIS -- CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE SCHOOLS BUT CAN COME WITH RISKS TO THE BUDGET IN FUTURE YEARS. COMPARE TO SPENDING MONEY AND GETTING AT THE MONEY TO THE SCHOOLS ALSO BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THIS BUDGET IN EDUCATION AND ACROSS ALL AREAS IS POISED TO WHETHER A DOWNTURN SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE IS THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR PROPOSITION. NINETY A GUARANTEE THERE'S JUS TWO BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA FOR SCHOOLS UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WERE ESTIMATING THAT MCALISTER'S PAYMENT WILL GIVE SCHOOLS ON AVERAGE ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY DOLLARS PER PUPIL -- SO WE HOPE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT I WILL -- TURNOVER JESSICA. JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU -- SO I'LL JUST ADD ON A COUPLE MORE THINGS AND TO IF YOU TAKE SAID -- IN ADDITION IT'S WITHOUT LOGGING TO FIGURE OUT FIRST BECAUSE WE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MIKE FINDS WORK AND WITH FORGETTING GIVEN MORE STAFFING. WE ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH MIKE AND MISTER FINE EXCUSE ME THE DIRECTOR OF OF THE A FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM. AND WE BELIEVE THAT HIS CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS NEEDS -- BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY ALWAYS IN CONTACT WITH HIM IN AND REASSESSING THAT -- IN ADDITION TO TO WHAT MISTER BUSH ONE OF ON SAID -- I'D LIKE TED TO JUST POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT PROPOSITION NINETY THIS OR THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME -- AND THE FIRST IS -- OUR DEARTH OF ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT SO FOR A LONG TIME -- WE WERE PAYING BACK THINGS LIKE MAINTENANCE FACTOR AND SETTLE UP INTO PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT AND WE ALSO HAD A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDS THAT CAME FROM -- ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEE TURNING OUT TO BE A LITTLE TOO LOW WHEN WE GOT OUR FOR OUR FINAL FACTORS REVENUES THROUGH IN PRIOR AND CURRENT YEAR -- WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT REDUCTIONS -- IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PRIOR AND CURRENT YEAR IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE -- INSTEAD OF INCREASES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN USED TO SEEING -- AND WE HAVE PAID OFF MAINTENANCE FACTOR -- ALMOST COMPLETELY AND OFF ALL OF OUR SATELLITE. SO A LOT OF TIMES WE WOULD USE THAT ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD HAVE USED ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION -- TWO PAYMENTS INTO THAT THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. ON BUT THE REALLY ISN'T MUCH ONE TIME FUNDING AVAILABLE THIS YEAR -- AND IN TERMS OF USING WHAT -- ON GOING FUNDING -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRESSURES -- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUILD THEIR BUDGETS ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF COLA FOR LCS. FIVE THAT REALLY IS A BIG PRIORITY FOR US TOOK THE BIT OF A BALANCE THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING ON THE FISCAL STABILITY OF OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. THERE'S ONE OTHER POINT THAT ALL MAKE AS WELL -- AND THIS GOES TO A POINT THAT MS TWO MADE ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN BUILDING RESERVES AND MAKING PAY DOWN STATE SAVE MONEY IN THE FUTURE. AND THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT ANSWER FOR THIS RIGHT SO THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SENDING TO CAL STARS ON BEHALF OF DISTRICTS -- YOU COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN WHICH YOU PUT THAT INTO A RESERVE ACCOUNT WHETHER IT'S THE P. S. S. S. A. OR SOME OTHER RESERVE ACCOUNT AND THEN YOU CAN DRAW ON IT IF THERE IS A DOWNTURN IN THE NEXT YEAR THAN SECOND OR THE THIRD YEAR -- BUT THE PAY DOWN HAS ITS OWN BENEFITS AND I KNOW IN THIS PRESENTATION I FOCUSED ON THE FIRST TWO YEARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE ALL OF US SCHOOLS WERE LOOKING AT WHAT'S DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US AND HOW THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE YEAR -- BUT REAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS ACTUALLY DEDICATED TOWARD THE OUT YEARS AND IT'S DIRECTLY DEPOSITED WITH CAL STIRS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS. AND IT ACTUALLY DROPS THEIR CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT SO IF THEY WERE GOING TO PAY EIGHTEEN POINT 4% OF PAYROLL -- INSTEAD TO PAY SEVENTEEN POINT TWO THAT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWENTY FORTY SIX ONE WE ALL HOPE -- THIS UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS WILL BE PAID OFF SO YOU KNOW THAT. IN A SAVINGS IN THOSE OUT YEARS BY HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT IT MAY SAY SCHOOLS ON AVERAGE BETWEEN LET'S SAY A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT SCHOOLS WILL SAVE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS BUT THAT MEANS EVERY YEAR AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHETHER SCHOOLS ARE HAVING A GOOD YEAR OR A BAD YEAR ECONOMICALLY IN TERMS OF THAT. STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC PICTURE THEY WILL BE PAYING LESS TO MEET THEIR PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO PAY SO WE THINK THAT THIS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONG TERM. AND I FIRM THAT -- YOU HAVE ON PAGE OF FOR WE HAVE. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REVISED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSED IN THE PACKAGE THAT WE RECEIVED. AND THE TOTAL EXPENDITURES ARE ALMOST THE SAME A HUNDRED FORTY FOR BILLION AND I'M JUST CURIOUS YOU YOU PROVIDED. SEVEN ADDITIONS TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ARE THEY ALREADY INCLUDED IN THESE TWO COLUMNS SO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN ELABORATE BUT SEVERAL OF THE BIG TICKET -- ITEMS THAT WE PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET PAYMENTS TO CALPERS ARE ACTUALLY SCHEDULED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEARS SO THE YEAR THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW INSTEAD OF THE BUDGET YEAR. AND ARE THINKING FOR THAT IS IF WE ALREADY HAVE THAT CASH IN HAND AND CALPERS PROJECTS AND INVESTMENT RETURN OF 7% PER YEAR ON ITS INVESTMENTS THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO GET THAT MONEY OUT THE DOOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SCHEDULED IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO I AGREE. IT DOES LOOK KIND OF FUNNY IN THAT YEAR THE EXPENDITURES OR YOU KNOW THE RIGHT MUSIC THINGS ARE. YOU HAVE A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ON THE ONE HAND ON THE OTHER THESE NUMBERS DON'T SEEM TO BE CHANGING ALL THAT MUCH FROM YEAR TO YEAR. AND IT BASICALLY HAS TO DO WITH HOW THOSE PAYMENTS ARE SCHEDULED TO MAYBE WE COULD GET IT A DETAILED AT YOU KNOW. BREAK DOWN ON HOW THAT WORKS SO WE CAN. YEAH ASSESS THAT YES THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS YOU DID MAKE ANY COMMENTS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT ALWAYS SEMS TO COME UP SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITIES YES. SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS OBLIGATED TO PUT OUT A OUTSIDE YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN -- THAT INCLUDES ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS -- WHETHER THERE AND RAIL TRANSIT ACROSS ALL AREAS THEY WILL BE PUTTING THAT OUT AT SOME POINT LATER THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY -- THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS HE STILL DELIBERATING -- FOR THE FUTURE OF THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM -- WILL BE IN THAT PLAN SO IT'S NOT -- THERE IS CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW WHAT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN -- WE HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN ON THOSE CONTINUE SUPER BUT YOU'LL CERTAINLY HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS OF LATER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR GREAT PRESENTATIONS APPRECIATED. THANK YOU WILL HAVE SENATOR BAIL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE. MINIATURE -- THANK YOU. FOR DURING THE HEARING AND AND I WANT TO HISTORICALLY. NOTE. THAT IS VERY RARE. THAT WE FIND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S IN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. AGREEING ON REVENUE ESTIMATES. AND SO SO I WAS SORT OF CURIOUS AS TO AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS. THAT -- WE HAVE TODAY VERSES THE METHODS OF THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS IN THE PAST -- BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SOME CHANGES OR IS THERE. ANY OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE METHODOLOGY. OR DID THE GOVERNOR FINALLY AGREED TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MATH OKAY SO. I WANT TO HEAR I WANT TO HEAR -- I I I THINK WE THEN AND THEN I THINK OVERALL THE PURPOSE OF THE QUESTION WOULD BE. IS THERE AN AGREEMENT ON LOOKING FORWARD -- WITH [inaudible] OUR ECONOMY. AND REVENUE PROJECTIONS OF WHAT KIND OF SCENARIOS WE CAN EXPECT SO. TO COME UP OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES. TO TO EVALUATE THAT IN A PROPER WAY. SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS ON REVENUE ESTIMATES THANK YOU I WILL JUST TAKE ONE OR TWO POINTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO AJ pOF THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRST IS THAT MY BOSS KELLY BOSS OR THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE -- STARTED HER CAREER AT THE LA OUT AS THAT HER PREDECESSOR MICHAEL TELLING SO THEY WERE JUST AS BEING USED AT YOU AT THE DRAFT PARMA FINANCING THE LA -- THESE NUMBERS ARE MATCHING UP AND IT ALMOST MAKES YOU IT MAKES YOU CHECK YOUR NUMBERS TWICE WHICH WHICH WE ARE KIND OF WONDER. SO I WAS GOING TO CHECK HIM THREE TIMES. USUALLY THERE'S A BIG FIGHT AT THIS HEARING. BETWEEN REVENUE ESTIMATES SUBMIT NOT TODAY I THINK THERE'S A LOT FASTER. WHAT'S GOING ON AS AND THE SECOND POINT I'LL MAKE -- WHICH WHICH TABLE I CAN DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL AS AS MENTIONED WE ARE FORECASTING -- SOME SLOWING GROWTH IN A REVENUE THREE POINT 2% OR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THEIR NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS. FIRST IS AN EXPECTATION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF A SLOWDOWN IN GDP GROWTH ON THIS IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH -- WHATEVER AFFECT THE AYE TAX REFORM IN DC MAY HAVE HAD -- THEY MIGHT OF HAD A LITTLE BIT OF ASTIMULUS OR PERHAPS EVEN A SUGAR HIGH THAT WEARS OFF OVER TIME NEW INVESTMENTS THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DROPPED THAT BILL ANTICIPATED SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO SEE THE GROWTH THERE. THAT SOME IN WASHINGTON DC MAYOR PROJECTED -- WE'RE ALSO SEEING RISING INFLATION AND ALTHOUGH WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ACTUALLY DO IN THE SHORT TERM FOR ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE THIS YEAR -- OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS THOSE INTEREST RATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE AND OF COURSE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE THAT RAISES THE COST OF BORROWING AND THEN THE ECONOMY IS PROJECTED TO SLOW. THE LAST THING -- WHICH CAN BE GOOD FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE BUT DOES IMPACT A REVENUE IS THAT JAY AND IRAN ASMAN SAN WHO'S OUR CHIEF ECONOMIST HAVE ALSO PROJECTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LITTLE MORE GROWTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. COMPARE TO THE TOP -- AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AT A TIME WHEN TO ME THAT. DENSITY ECONOMY GO TO THE TOP BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA ARE TAX REVENUE SYSTEM. IS PRETTY HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD THE HIGHEST INCOME EARNERS SAID THAT IT'S EXPECTED TO MODERATE THE GROWTH OF REVENUE AS WELL AND WITH THAT ALTERNATIVE J.. A GOOD MORNING JAKE CHAMBERLAIN A DEPARTMENT FINANCE -- INTO AYE A I AM THE HEAD OF THE REVENUE S. MEETING UNIT -- SO REALLY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SAME MODELS -- FIVE FIVE WAS I WAS -- IN CHARGE OF THE REVENUE AS MANY UNITS UNDER THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION -- SO WE WERE USING THE SAME MODELS REALLY WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE SPRING IS THAT -- I SAID REALLY TWO THINGS ONE ALTHOUGH THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A RIGHT NOW THE STOCK MARKET FOR MOST OF THE YEAR HAS ADDITIONALLY -- WITHHOLDING HAS BEEN GROWING A LOT FASTER THAN -- THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED SO EVEN THE WAGE GROWTH HAS BEEN PRETTY COMPARABLE TO WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED. WITHHOLDING HAS BEEN OUTPACING WAGE GROWTH WHAT THAT THE WE WE WE INTERPRET THAT HIS THAT. MORE THE WAY TRUTH IS GOING TO HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS. WHO PAY AT A HIGHER MARGINAL TAX RATE? AND SO WITHOUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHY ARE ARE WRITTEN FOR CASES BEEN BUMPED UP. BUT WE DO NOT -- LET'S NOT JOB GROWTH. PLEASE WAGE GROWTH WAGE NOT JOB GROWTH WAGE GROWTH WAITRESS RIGHT YES -- AND WE DO NOT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE FOR THE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT. THAT -- HIGH GROWTH -- IN THE IN THE HIGH INCOME HIGH FOR THE HIGH INCOME SECTOR. AND SO WE DO THINK THAT MORE THE WAY TRUTH IS GOING TO BE GOING. TO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME. LEVELS ARE ARE MORE MORE PROPORTIONAL SO WE DON'T. A STRONG WE TRUTH ADDITIONALLY -- EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE THE STRONG CAPITAL GAINS A STRONG STOCK MARKET THROUGH MOST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE DO EXPECT THAT WE DID EXPECT IT TO BE SLOWING IT IS ACTUALLY SLOWED MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED SO. WHO KNOWS WORK GOES FROM HERE? BUT SO THAT. THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BUMPED UP OUR OUR REVENUE FORECAST BEYOND WHAT WE HAD IN -- BACK IN MAY -- IT IS INDEED WE DO ANTICIPATE RELATIVELY SLOW GROWTH FROM HERE ON OUT. SO I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE THINGS -- FOR CONTEXT OF THIS CONVERSATION ONE IS THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES REFLECT AN INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE BUDGET YEAR EITHER EXCUSE ME THE PRIOR YEAR THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YOU'RE THE ACROSS THE THREE YEAR WINDOW. AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS RECOGNIZING. REVENUE AND THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY TRANSPIRED SO IT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SORT OF A OUT YOUR ISSUE THERE IS SORT OF A BIT OF MORE KNOWN QUANTITY ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY AS A MISTER CHAMBERLAIN ALREADY MENTIONED IN THINGS LIKE STRONG THROUGHOUT. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ALSO SAW A PRETTY ROBUST JOB GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO SO THERE HAS BEEN GOOD EVIDENCE ODD TO THAT EFFECT -- I LIKE YOU CENTRE BELL WAS ALSO VERY SURPRISED AT HOW CLOSE ARE REVENUE -- ESTIMATES WERE -- ADD TO YOUR LAST QUESTION IN TERMS OF PREPARING -- FOR WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF REVENUES DID COME IN LOWER WE TO BRANDON A RECESSION SCENARIO FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR OUTLOOK IN NOVEMBER -- AND WE ARE -- PLAYED OUT TWO SCENARIOS USING THE SAME RECESSION AND THEIR FIRST SESSION WE USE RETURNED AT A MODERATE RECESSION -- IT WASN'T IT WASN'T IT WAS A SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THE DOT COM BUST THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS AS SEVERE -- UNDER OUR ESTIMATES IN THAT SCENARIO -- A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ONGOING AUGMENTATION WOULD BE ABLE TO BE SUSTAINED -- IN TERMS OF THERE BEING ENOUGH -- RESERVES TO CONTINUOUS -- SPENDING WITHOUT MAKING CUTS THAT SAID OUR ASSUMPTIONS -- DID -- INCLUDE AT TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THE SURPLUS THAT WE HAD ESTIMATED AND PUTTING THAT INTO RESERVE SO WE UNDER OUR AYE DOWNTURN SCENARIO DID. AS MAY OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF CASH RESERVES AS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE MORE LIABILITIES ARE BEING PAID DOWN. OKAY OKAY THAT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT THAT I LIKE MORE. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON NOT. THE REVENUE ESTIMATES TEAM TO ME THE WILL DRIVE THE SPENDING COURSE SO -- ADVENTURE I JUST HAD ONE MORE QUESTION THE THE GOVERNOR -- A WONDERFUL -- VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE HOUSING -- ONE TIME FUNDS BUT THE QUESTION IS -- IS THE GOVERNOR INCLUDING. ANY ONGOING [inaudible] FUNDING. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT IN -- FOR GOING TO HOLD YOU KNOW JUST. STARTING TO DEBATE ON SP ONE WHICH OF COURSE I'M FAMILIAR WITH -- IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO DEBATE ON I I THINK -- IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DEBATE IT WHEN WE'RE ONLY TALKING THIS YEAR'S SERVE ON ONE TIME FUNDS. FOR HOUSING AND NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE ON GOING. NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT OF COURSE SB ONE NINETY EIGHT NINETY SOME PERCENT OF THE FUNDS -- IN SB. ONE OUR FOR LOCAL GOOD WITH THE MONEY SO COULD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY ALLOCATED FOR THE MAINTENANCE. BACKLOG. THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. AND I THINK IT IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOLDING BACK MAINTENANCE BACKLOG FUNDS -- AND THEN THE OTHER CONCERN IS THE S. B. ONE REVENUE. PROJECTIONS WE GOT A NEW STUDY. FROM OUR ACADEMIC RESEARCH WE PUT MONEY IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND SB ONE WEEK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE ALL THESE STUDIES -- THAT SHOWS MORE INFORMATION THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS ACTUALLY INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE SP ONE REVENUE INCREASES BUT THEN AS WE START TO HAVE. A FEW ECONOMY IN OUR VEHICLE FLEET IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR MILLION. VEHICLES WE START TO SEE MORE AND MORE EFFICIENCY. OF THE RIVER ACTUALLY DROP SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE. REALLY -- ABOUT A TEN YEAR TWELVE YEAR PERIOD [inaudible] OF TIME. TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE MAINTENANCE [inaudible] REPAIR. REHABILITATION BACKLOG WE DON'T HAVE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE. WITH THE GASOLINE TAX IT DOESN'T EXIST IT'S FOOLHARDY EVEN THINK THAT. SO I I'M LOOKING. FOR IS THERE GOING TO BE AN EXPLORATION OF ON GOING REVENUE. THIS NEEDED TO THE DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING PROBLEM -- AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF OF THE QUESTION. AND IS THE LA -- HAVE COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL. YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO ON THE A HOUSING YOU ARE CORRECT THAT ALMOST ALL THE FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET FOR HOUSING IS ONE TIME AND ALSO SEPARATELY I WOULD -- WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE THAT -- STUDY ON SB ONE WE WILL TEST WHAT IT'S DONE BY THE MINNESOTA INSTITUTE SO THE STATE AND WE WE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A THE TRANSPORTATION -- COMMITTEE HEARING. OF TO KIND OF GO OVER TRANSPORTATION. FOR KIND OF A NEW MEMBER KIND OF ORIENTATION HEARING AND AND WE'RE GOOD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PROFESSORS COME. AND TALK ABOUT IT -- ITS IT'S IT WAS PUBLISHED ITS -- STOP BY THE MINETA INSTITUTE. ARE THE BEST AT PROJECTING -- THE REVENUES SO WE SEE THE REVENUE IS. IS NOT A LIKE AN ON GOING PERMANENT REVENUE IS KIND OF LIKE HOLDS UP FOR A FEW YEARS THAT STARTS TO DROP STARTS. TO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU THE FUEL ECONOMY CARS GO. TO THIRTY FORTY FIFTY MILES. A PER GALLON AND MORE MORE ELECTRIC OR ARE ARE. YOU KNOW THE TIDE OF PETERS OUT THE GAS TAX REVENUE. SO I'LL MAKE -- TWO QUICK POINTS AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY -- THE FIRST IS WE DO HAVE -- AND MISS T MENTION FOR OUR TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS THAT'S DESIGNED TO BE AN ONGOING CREDIT GOT PROGRAM THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS NOW AS MISSED YOU POINTED OUT WE DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN THE BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE THE CREDITS ARE AWARDED AND THEN THE PROJECTS ARE. BILLS AND AND THE OWNERS OF THE CREDIT SEE THOSE BENEFITS OVER TIME SO DOES COST TO THE STATE BUDGET COM SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. BUT WE ANTICIPATED OUR BUDGET PROVIDING THOSE CREDITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AND AS MENTIONED THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMSAND EDUCATIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW PROGRAM FOR MORE MODERATE INCOME AND THERE'S LIKE A THE FOR THE CREDIT SHOULD YOU KNOW EXACTLY SO THAT WAY UP IN REAL QUICK IT'S RIGHT. UNDER THE OF A BUBBLE THIS. RARE BURST ON THE CREDITS ITS PEOPLE ARE READY TO GO WITHOUT-THAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THAT THE 9% CREDIT PROGRAM IS OVERSUBSCRIBED BUT ACTUALLY THIS UP 4% PROGRAM WHICH IS A MUCH GENEROUSLY ON NOT SO MUCH WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA FOCUS OUR ATTENTION OVER THERE AND WE MAY. RUN INTO THE SAME PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE BUT WE'RE HOPING TO MEET SOME OF THAT DEMAND AND THEN THE OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE -- IS -- THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THESE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN -- CONFORMITY WHICH WE TOUCHED ON JUST BRIEFLY ON THAT COULD BE USED FOR ALL SORTS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN THESE ZONES BUT THE FOCUS FOR THE GOVERNOR IS REALLY ON TWO THINGS IT'S ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND GREEN JOBS AND YOU KNOW GREEN DR LEGISLATION THAT WE OF AUTHORED -- WE AUTHORED IT. KANSEN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING THIS TO SB -- SIX TWENTY EIGHT BUT WE'RE WE HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL THAT DOES AWAY WITH THE VOTING REQUIREMENTS. AND IT WAS VETO LASHER A THICK OR I THINK CENTER ALLEN HAD A BILL AND NOT -- WE'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT -- TO REMOVE THE IMPEDIMENTS. YEAH SO WE'RE HOPING THAT WILL BE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I OF I DON'T KNOW IF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. AS THE COMMENTS ON HOUSING. HOUSING ISSUES WE WILL HAVE MET WE CERTAINLY HAVE HAD WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ON THE HOUSING ISSUE WHEN WE PLAN. TO WORK ON IN PARTICULAR THIS ISSUE ON MAKING THE RENO TARGETS -- MORE MEANING FALL -- AS WE WORK THROUGH THE THE HOUSING PROJECT PACKAGE BOB PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND OF COURSE YOUR USER AWARE OF THIS AS WELL BUT YES BE TO FINDING YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT IN OUR BUDGET THIS IS A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION FEES YES. THIS WASN'T MY COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YES THIS WAS A MY QUESTION BY YOUR REVENUE GUY. SAID THAT. THE CAPITAL GRAINS WAS CAPITAL GAINS TAXES LESS THAN WHAT WE EXPECTED FROM THAT THE PRESIDENT'S -- LEGISLATION AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I THOUGHT PART OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ON WAS THESE PEOPLE WITH THESE CAPITAL GAINS WAS GONNA GO IN AND DO THIS INVESTMENT. AND AND I HAVE TO PAY CAPITAL GAINS SO I I JUST. IT'S HIS QUESTION I'M JUST STILL HIS OFFICE WORK SO ON THE AND I'LL LET J. ELABORATE ON THAT CAPITAL GAINS UNDER -- THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS PROPOSAL EXISTING CAPITAL GAINS ARE DEFERRED IF THAT MONEY IS ROLLED INTO A OPPORTUNITIES OUT IN THE END ABLE STILL HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST 85% OF THAT CAPITAL GAINS LIABILITY. BUT IT MAY NOT BE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS ON THE NAME ONLY THE NEW CAPITAL GAINS FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES ON INVESTMENT. IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY BE ELIMINATED BUT AGAIN THE REVENUE THAT WOULD NOT BE UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY SIX MADAM CHAIR I NOW GET TO MY QUESTION FIRE -- WELL POWER WILDFIRE PROBLEM BIG PROBLEM -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HEARING ON IT SAID I JUST WANT TO GET SOME. OVERALL STRATEGY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S IN FOR FIRE PREVENTION THAT WAS THIS SENATE COMMITTEES WORK WE WE CREATED AT THE CAT. THROW THE THROWN IN FOR FIVE YEARS AND SB NINE A ONE THERE WERE SOME OTHER -- ASSOCIATED LEGISLATION THAT'S IN THERE WHICH WOULD A CLUMP THE SUPPRESSION IN THE PREVENTION TOGETHER AND I JUST WANT TO GET THE IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING. TO YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT LIMITED FUNDS WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE HAS FUNDS WERE RUNNING INTO YOU KNOW PROTECTING COMMUNITIES THAT'S VALUABLE MAXIMIZING CARBON SEQUESTRATION THAT'S VALUABLE YOU KNOW PROTECTING WHAT KEY WATERSHED THAT'S VALUABLE SO. WHAT'S THE WHAT THE HELL WE GOING TO ON WILDLIFE AFFECTED -- EFFORTS HOW WE GET TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFORT IS THERE SOME STRATEGIC PLAN TO COORDINATE SAID OR WE COULD DO THESE RANDOM ACTS OF RESTORATION THROW MONEY HERE TOO MANY THERE IF IN THE SUPPRESSION WORLD. IN IN THE PREVENTION WHILE I LIKE TO SEPARATE THEM. BECAUSE WE'LL DO IT AGAIN AND SUBCOMMITTEE THIS YEAR TO SAY TALK ABOUT SHINY RIDE SHINY FIRE TRUCKS I KNOW THEY WANT YOU GUYS HAVE THIRTEEN SHINY. FIRE TRUCKS THE UNION WANTS THIRTY ONE SHINY FIRE TRUCKS WE'RE PUTTING THE HELICOPTERS AND WE'RE DO WE DID THAT ON THE SUPPRESSION. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THIS STRATEGIC DISCUSSION IF YOU COULD TODAY AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN TWO WEEKS -- I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS IN AND TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE REALLY BOLD AND AND NINE AND THEN I DON'T WANT LEGISLATION THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE FIVE YEARS AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE MOST RECENT FIRES SO. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THAT THROUGH AND ALL THE BUDGETS TO CALM THE MONEY THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE AND THAT'S ALSO THAT'S GENERAL FUEL REDUCTION EFFORTS BUT IT'S ALSO WITH. NOT JUST CAL FIRE BUT YOU KNOW THE CONSERVATION CORPS AND MISTY FOREST RECORD AND WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO GET LOCAL COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN THESE EFFORTS AND THAT'S THROUGH THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. PREPAREDNESS GRANT BUT OTHER -- THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE SECOND THING THE BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED IS YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE THAT STRATEGY HERE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE ADMINISTRATION -- THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THESE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER AND EVEN THE ELEMENTS IN THE BUDGET -- OF COURSE THE BUDGET WAS PUT TOGETHER UNDER SHORT TIME FRAME BUT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT -- YEAH I GUESS BUT IT COULD BE WHAT IT IS RANDOM BUT IT REALLY IS AND ALL OF THE ABOUT STRATEGY YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS BUT RIGHT NOW MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION ARE DEALING WITH -- P. JEANNIE -- SIGNALING A POSSIBLE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN DAYS AND OF COURSE WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THAT SITUATION ON THIS ALL OF A PIECE OF HOW CAN WE BOTH. PREVENT THESE FIRES FROM HAPPENING IN MEDICAID TO RESULTS IN THE FUTURE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US YAHOO JUST NOTE WITH. ALL OF P. GENIES WILLOWS THERE'S THEY'RE PROPOSING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR PREVENTION AND TREAT. CLEARING ON LAND THAT THEY DON'T OWN THEY JUST HAVE WIRES ABOVE IT THAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN AND WE'RE WE'RE AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAVE JUST ON GENERAL PREVENTION FOR ALL FOR EVERYTHING NOT. NOT TEAT CLEARING ANOTHER. AREA I HAVE AS GREENHOUSE GASES -- REDUCTION FUND THE CAPTAIN CAP AND TRADE I WILL NOTE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OPTIONS CAME IN A LITTLE NORTH OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- AB -- THIRTY TWO FUNDING WHICH IS REQUIRED SS TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES GASES -- WE CANNOT DO IT FOR OTHER WORTH WILD -- EFFORTS I SEE THAT THERE'S IN TO WORKFORCE TRAINING [inaudible] LAUDABLE GOAL. THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS FUND IS A LAUDABLE GOAL TO BUT WE'RE RESTRICTED ON THE GREENHOUSE GASES TO OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO REDUCE ITS -- JUST FLAGGING IT UNTIL I CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH IS. TALK AIR TOXIC IN CULTURE AIR POLLUTANTS ONE REDUCE THOSE BUT WE HAVE. TO EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND FROM AB THIRTY TO CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WERE REQUIRED BY LAW TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES SO I'M JUST. FIGHTING IT JUST LIKE THE LA -- TO SPEAK PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THEY'LL BE. INCREASED AUCTIONS FOR STATE VERSUS YOUR ESTIMATE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HOW TO STRATEGICALLY SPEND THOSE TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BOX BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT. THE ROAD MAINTENANCE WE HAVE TWELVE YEARS TO DO SOMETHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND I SAW SOME. GENERAL DISCUSSIONS HERE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE PANIC THAT I THINK. THE WORLD IS WATCHING CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ACTIONS ON SO THIS IS JUST OUR FIRST DISCUSSION. BUT I'LL JUST MAKE ONE POINT AND NOT IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT ON THAT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. I'M DEFINITELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT YOU SAID THAT IS -- SPACE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON PATHWAYS INTO WHAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE A LOW CARBON ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE. JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IT IS NOT A GENERAL JOBS APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAM IT IS SQUARE WE FOCUSED ON THE AREAS THAT -- ARE DESIGNED TO BE FUNDED BY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM YEAH I WE'LL HAVE THAT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IS JUST IS JUST TO ACTION AS ACTUAL REDUCTIONS RIGHT YES. IT'S CHALLENGE. THANK YOU I'LL GO AHEAD I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. OF METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ACTUALLY. SPECIFICALLY HAD PROVISIONS. REQUIRING A REPORT FROM THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO GET AT THE SURFACE -- ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE -- APPRENTICESHIPS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS -- TO TRANSITION THE STATE TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY SO CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT AS SPECIFIED IN A. B.. THREE NINETY EIGHT TO BRING A JOB TRAINING A PERNICIOUS ASPECT TO THE CAP AND TRADE A WORLD SPACE AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE A P. THIRTY TWO EXTENDS. TO TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT WAS OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE PROPONENTS ON THE CAPTURE EXTENSION WE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT WAS THAT'S THE LIMITATION AND AGAIN WE'LL GET DOWN TO THE WE'D SAID JUST WANTED. TO POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A LIMITATION. THOSE THAT EXTENSION HAPPENS IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS BUDGET IS. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THANK YOU SENATOR TO ROSWELL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR STONE AND THEN SENATOR MCGUIRE. SENATOR DURACELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I WANT TO ASK OF ABOUT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SAFE. AND CLEAN WATER -- WHAT WOULD THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS GO FOR IT AND NOW THAT I'M ON THE SUBJECT I JUST ONE IT KNOWLEDGE -- THE LOTUS WORD THE WHO'S BEEN A CHAMPION AND A HERO FOR US NOT ONLY. FOR ALL RULE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS BUT ALL WORKERS SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THE LOTUS -- SO -- IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS GO TOWARDS -- IN -- BOTH COVERAGES WELL AS UP ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM IS IT ONE TENTH OF WHAT'S NEEDED IS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW FOR HOW FAR WILL IT GO. TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS SAFE CLEAN WATER SAUL MAKE TWO POINTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE NOT ONLY. ON THE FIRST IS THAT -- IT IS CERTAINLY -- DOWN PAYMENT AND THERE ARE -- TO THEIR TWO BUCKETS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS I THINK BOTH ARE IMPORTANT AND NOT WILL DISCUSS EACH OF THEM ONE IS STRICTLY FOR EMERGENCY SUPPLIES YOU KNOW THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED WATER RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S BOTTLED WATER OR AND VIRGINS TEXT WELL WATER SYSTEMS. AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WATER SYSTEMS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE STANDARDS SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL INTO DISREPAIR. BUT THE BROADER QUESTION I YOU ASKED IS YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THIS IS SUSTAINABLE INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE KNOW THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR ON HOW TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IN MAKING SURE EVERY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA HAS. DRINKING WATER THAT IS SAFE TO DRINK -- AND SO YOU KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN. OUTLINED SOME TYPE OF FEE APPROACH IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR BUT WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. FROM MATTE ONLY DEPARTMENT FINANCE REALLY KIND OF SENATE -- ANY BETTER I WOULD JUST MAYBE UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT -- THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS THERE'S TEN MILLION FOR THE EMERGENCY SUPPLIES THERE'S ALSO TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL COLO ASSISTANCE WHICH DOWN PAYMENT JUMPSTART OF THESE OTHER CRITICAL TYPE PROJECTS THAT. NEED TO HAPPEN WHILE. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OF THE LEGISLATURE ON A SUSTAINABLE ONGOING A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ASPECT. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT A LOT OF THESE SMALL COMMUNITIES -- NEED SOME ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE. TO OF DO THE APPROPRIATE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. AND TECHNICAL WORK. NEEDED TO TO PROVIDE THAT SAFE DRINKING WATER THAT IS A A PURPOSE OF WHICH SAFE DRINKING WATER FEE. OF COULD BE APPLIED FOR A AND SO AGAIN THIS IS A A JUMPSTART. TO DO SO ONGOING EFFORTS. TO AYE AYE ASSET BECAUSE SOME YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE ONE DAY THIRD THEY HAVE BAD WATER I MEAN WHAT CONTRIBUTES. TO THEM NOT HAVING SAFE AND CLEAN WATER IN THESE AREAS AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. SO. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REALLY CAUSING. THEM NOT TO HAVE SAFE AND CLEAN WATER THEN WHAT ARE WE GONG TO INVEST IN THAT'S MOST NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE THE PROBLEM SO. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AND I'M I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED -- BE STARTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND YOU KNOW THE FUTURE -- IT SOUNDED VERY DOOMSDAY AND PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE OKAY WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE A BAD ECONOMY EVERY TEN YEARS OR WHICH SAID THINGS HAVE TO GO. AS IF IT WAS JUST ON A NORMAL BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T JUST GO THROUGH WHAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S NORMAL NATURAL CYCLE IS WE THINK DIFFERENT WHERE WE'RE AHEAD OF IT. SO -- I THINK IN TERMS OF PROGRESSIVE ECONOMIC IDEAS SO THAT. PEOPLE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SAVE [inaudible] BECAUSE IT'S DOOMSDAY IS UPON US BUT WE ACTUALLY ON THE CONTRARY ARE PROACTIVE IN INVESTING WHAT.% ARE FUNDS IN WHAT WILL. PROTECT US AND IN FACT KEEP US IN A IN A GROWTH ECONOMY -- SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU COULD ADD TO THAT BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IS -- HOW ALL OF THIS MONEY CONTRIBUTES TO THE ECONOMY IN THE WELL BEING THROUGH GOOD JOBS? SO IS THERE A CONNECTION AS YOU DO ALL OF THIS BUDGET -- TO HOW MANY JOBS ARE CREATED. BY OUR INVESTMENT BY OUR SPENDING AND THE THAT KIND OF GOOD JOBS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO RIGHT WE WANT MORE PEOPLE TO GO FROM. POOR LOW WAGE JOBS TO GOOD PAIN MIDDLE CLASS AND UPPER MIDDLE CLASS JOBS SO HOW DO WE CONTRIBUTE TO ALL OF THIS INVESTMENT I THINK. OUR RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. HOW ELSE TO MY BENEFITING NOT JUST FROM THE SERVICE? BUT ALSO CAN MORE JOBS OR CREATE MORE JOBS ARE CREATED AS A RESULT OF THIS IS THERE SOME SORT OF CONNECTION -- ANALYSIS THERE. HUESO LET ME -- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE -- POINTS ON THE FIRST YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT ECONOMIC ROSE DOESN'T NECESSARILY DIE OF OLD AGE AND THERE'S NO FORMULA FOR WHEN A BUSINESS CYCLE REVERSES AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WE ARE PREPARING FOR GROWING RISKS BUT THE TREE DAYS. NOBODY KNOWS -- WHAT THE ECONOMIC PICTURE WILL BE THIS COMING YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT AND I THINK YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME UNIX FRIENDS YOU KNOW NOT JUST THE OFT CITED STATISTICS THAT WERE THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT? WE HAVE A VERY EDUCATED POPULATION -- OUR PROPORTION OF IMMIGRANTS -- FOREIGN BORN AMERICANS IN THE STATE IS ABOUT DOUBLE THAT NATION AS A WHOLE ABOUT 27% INSTEAD OF AROUND 14% FOR AMERICA I THINK THAT'S A SOURCE OF STRENGTH WE CLEARLY PUNCH ABOVE OUR WEIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION -- PATENTS PER CAPITA SO ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL PUT US IN GOOD STEAD -- I THINK THE ONE RECESS AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE CLEARLY PUT. FORWARD WHAT WE THINK IS A BOLD A PROGRESSIVE BUDGET BLUEPRINT -- AS GOVERNOR YOU SOME SAID TO MAKE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM REAL ONCE MORE WE ARE STILL WANTING TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE LOOK BACK TO RECENT HISTORY AND WE REMEMBER WHEN. OTHERS MADE SIMILAR ARGUMENTS IN THE NINETEEN THE BUSINESS CYCLE ON AND ONE THING THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME WAS LOOKING AT AND THE LA -- POINTED OUT AND ONE OF ITS DOCUMENTS IS THAT THE SURPLUS IS SO BIG WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SURPLUS LIKE THIS SINCE YOU KNOW NINETEEN NINETY NINE OR TWO THOUSAND AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THAT SO WE'RE NOT FORECASTING ANY SORT OF RECESSION AND WE KNOW WE HAVE. A LOT OF FRIENDS WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE CAREFUL SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT IF SOMETHING BAD WERE TO HAPPEN INCLUDING SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL INCLUDING A NATURAL DISASTER OF SOME TYPE -- WE WILL BE READY FOR THAT -- BUT ON THAT SECOND POINT THAT YOU MENTION ABOUT JOBS IN THIS IS A KEY PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BUT REALLY THE WAY HE'D YOU SAID IN THIS BUDGET IS -- CRADLE TO CAREER AND HE ACTUALLY JUST APPOINTED I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS A SIMILAR POSITION IN THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION BUT A SENIOR ADVISER ON HIS TEAM WHO FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON CRADLE TO CAREER NO THAT'S THE JOB TITLE. AND SO IT'S NOT JUST MORE MONEY FOR EARLY EDUCATION MORE MONEY FOR K. TWELVEMORE MONEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT IT'S HOW ARE THESE ALL LINKED TOGETHER AND HOW TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE. ON THE GOVERNOR ALSO POINTED OUT HE WILL BE TAKING OFFICE NEXT MONTH BUT AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOW MANY MEN DON SO PROFITS THE NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION IT'S LIKE A LAYS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE -- ARE PREPARED FOR NOT JUST ON THE COASTS BUT ALL ACROSS THE STATE IN FACT TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER AT YOU SEE MORE SIDE ON THIS LAST SUMMER AND TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES EVERYWHERE. SO THIS BUDGET IS JUST A DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT BUT DEFINITELY REST ASSURED THAT THAT WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION GO FORWARD. NINETY SEVEN TWO ITEMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE. TO ANSWER THEM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF OF OTHER SPEAKING AND MAY BE JUST FOLLOW UP WITH OUR STAFF IS ON THE ISSUE OF MEDI CAL. ON A NIGHT NOTICE THAT SOME. EXPANDED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED WANT TO SEE. YOU KNOW. WHAT WOULD BE THE ESTIMATES FOR A MUCH LARGER LIKE THE ENTIRE UNDOCUMENTED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE EVENTUALLY AFTER? COVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION UNINSURED SO THIS IS A COULD BE A MAJOR STP NOT JUST A GOOD STEP BUT A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. SO WHAT WOULD BE THOSE. THE COST WITH A GREATER. AND THE OTHER THAT LATER IS I WANT UNDERSTAND BETTER THE THE MCO TAX AND YOU MENTIONED THAT AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO WAIVERS WHAT THE FED SO. I JUST WANT TO GET SCHOOL DONE THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT A WHOLE LOT BETTER BECAUSE BY PASSING A BILLION DOLLARS. IN REVENUE SEEMS LIKE. NOT SOMETHING WE COULD JUST DO EASILY AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE BUT ANYWAY SO IF YOU COULD FOLLOW UP WITH US ON THOSE TWO ISSUES AND IF I COULD FACE AN IS IT AROUND SO I THINK I MENTIONED AT THE ON TO THE HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- FOR MORE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND ONE OF THEM WILL VERY LIKELY FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE. THE HEALTH PROPOSAL SO WE CAN GET IN DEPTH THEN FOR THE MONEY I KNOW YOU HAVE A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON WATER THAT I'M SURE CENTER STONE WILL ALLOW YOU. TO IN THE THIRD GO HEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY I JUST WANT TO START BY THANKING BOTH MR. FIRST WANT ONE OF FUN IN MISS CHIU FOR YEAR OUTSTANDING PRESENTATIONS HOUSE WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE GOVERNOR'S ANA. TREMENDOUS COMMITMENT TO FINDING A BALANCE BETWEEN PAYING DOWN DEBT INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS IT'S IT'S REALLY. A LOT OF BRILLIANT WORK IN FOR FIVE DAYS OF BEING GOVERNOR -- AND I WANT TO THANK MADAM CHAIR IN YOUR TEAM FOR PREPARATION FOR TODAY -- ON THE FOLLOW UP ON THE WATER I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE DELORES HUERTA. IN ADDITION TO BEING A CHAMPION FOR HIM FAMILIES SHE'S BEEN ONE OF THE LEAD -- CHAMPIONS FOR CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER NOT JUST IN RURAL FARMING AREAS BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU MADE REFERENCE TO THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR EMERGENCY FUND FOR FOR BOTTLED WATER BASICALLY -- IN THE OTHER TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUND THE GOVERNOR REFERENCE TO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. DOLLAR COMMITMENT IN THE BUDGET SO I'D LIKE YOU TO JUST IF YOU COULD CLARIFY. WHAT WHAT DANCE FOR MY UNDERSTANDING? YOU REFERENCED ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN BONTA MONIES ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IN THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. BOND MONEY CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BUT NOT FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OR OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT. THAT'S BEN THE BIG CHALLENGE OF FINDING AN ON GOING REVENUE SOURCE I BELIEVE YOU INDICATED. IT'S IN THE BUDGET IS ONE TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION BUT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR AN ONGOING. REVENUE SOURCE -- HELP ME UNDERSTAND -- THE GOVERNOR'S PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE DEVELOP THAT ON TIME OUR ON GOING REVENUE SOURCE THAT'S PREDICTABLE AND THAT CAN BE ALLOCATED TO POOR COMMUNITIES TO PAY FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. OIL MAKE THREE POINTS AND THEN BACK YOU CAN WEIGH IN AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST DAYS FOR THIS TWENTY TWO TEN MILLION DOLLAR MARKETS -- THEY'RE BOTH ONE TIME AND THEY'RE ALSO IMMEDIATE AND AS MENTIONED WE WANT TO GET BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IS THAT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS FROM PROPOSITION -- SIXTY EIGHT PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND AS YOU REMEMBER SPLIT BETWEEN BILLY PARKS WATER AND WILDLIFE AND YOU NATURAL HABITAT RESTORATION. ON SO THAT'S WHERE THAT MONEY IS COMING FROM FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS AND THEN FOR THE ON GOING -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET WE SAID WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- PERHAPS ON SOME TYPE OF FEE STRUCTURE THAT COULD PROVIDE THIS REVENUE ON AND IT IS A FAIR QUESTION WELL YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG SURPLUS -- YOU KNOW WHY YOU PUT SOME OF THAT AND BUT THE FACT IS PEOPLE NEED SIX CHECKING WATER EVERY YEAR RIGHT NOT JUST THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR. ON IT SO SOME THESE ONE TIME COMMITMENTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND WHETHER IT'S SPLIT BETWEEN AT THE OFFICE VERY SMALL FEE ON ALL WATER USERS WHETHER IT'S ON PRODUCERS WERE PUTTING NITRATES INTO THE GROUND AS PART. OF THEIR OPERATIONS IN NINETY WE CAN STRUCTURE THAT IN A WAY WHERE THEIR THEY CAN BE ON BOARD AS WELL IT CAN BE A CONVERSATION AMONG EVERYONE. THAT'S WHERE WE BELIEVE THE ON GOING -- WATER THE FEE WILL BE FOUND -- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO WORK WITH A LOT RIGHT WELL THANK YOU IN AGAIN. GREATLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING THIS A SPOTLIGHT ISSUE I KNOW HE TOOK SOME OF THE CABINET MEMBERS TO THE COMMUNITY OF MONTEREY PARK -- COMMUNITY STRUGGLING TO SECURE CLEAN DRINKING WATER NEAR SERIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- HE'S CLEARLY -- SHOWN THROUGH THE BUDGET HIS COMMITMENT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK -- I KNOW FROM THE LEADERS OF BOTH HOUSES ALSO SHARE A COMMITMENT TO THIS BEING A HIGH PRIORITY. THE CHALLENGE HOWEVER OF THE ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE. I KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS WHILE THERE ARE -- SURPLUSES IDENTIFIED IN REVENUE STREAMS -- A QUESTION TO MAYBE EXPLORE NOT NECESSARILY ANSWER RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER WE COULD DEVOTE ANY OF REVENUE SURPLUSES TO SOME TYPE OF A CAPITAL FUND THAT COULD GENERATE -- PREDICTABLE INTEREST TO REVENUE -- AS PART OF AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE MAYBE NOT ALL OF IT BUT AS A CONTRIBUTION. TO AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE OTHER -- SOURCES OF FUNDING THERE COULD BE A PREDICTABLE CAPITAL ACCOUNT WERE PART OF THAT CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND. COULD BE -- AVAILABLE FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT THAT PAYS OUT A PREDICTABLE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE USED FOR COMMUNITIES FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. OPEN TO YEAR CONSIDERATION WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE IT. SENATOR MCGUIRE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR STUFF THANK YOU SO MUCH VENTURE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] PLANES. YOU HAVE TO DO I SWEAR TO YOU I I DO. TO LISTEN TO THIS -- PRESSING. MADAME CHAIR IS A BREAKING OUT THE TWO BY FOUR TODAY YOU SO I THINK YOU SO MUCH HIGH DAM -- ARE GONNA MAKE TWO VERY QUICK COMMENTS IN ONLY ABOUT SIX QUESTIONS SO I'M KIDDING FEDERAL -- FIRST WHY I WANT TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. ABOUT THE GOVERNOR -- IN HIS BOSS THERE THEY HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF WILD AND FIRES -- LAKE COUNTIES HAD 60% OF THEIR LAND MASS BURN SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND MISS MOSLER HAS JUST BEEN AN ANGEL AND I JUST WANNA PASS THAT ALONG IS HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE. NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL THINKING ABOUT IT KNOWS THREE YEARS OF THAT PROPERTY TAXES MEAN A GREAT DEAL TO THEM SO THANK YOU -- ALSO ON THE NINE ONE ONE FEE. JUST FANTASTIC ABOUT MOVING FOR NOT BE SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET A LONG TERM FIX FOR THAT AND I WOULD HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE A BIPARTISAN. THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL ENGINES GETS US A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE ACTUALLY -- HAD EIGHTEEN MORE THAN. THREE FIFTY SIX SO I WOULD HOPE. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ENGINES AND THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THAT NUMBER ONE WHICH WE KNOW IS EACH UNIT. ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST CHALLENGER THE STATE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO COVER. NUMBER TWO BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF FIREFIGHTERS ON IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE LINE SIXTY DAYS FORTY FIVE DAYS THIRTY DAYS. AND THE MORE FOLKS THAT WE CAN PUT ON THE BETTER SO -- WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF ACRES BURNED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE ARE NOT EVEN AT ARMS NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE LEVELS -- AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR MOVING WITH THOSE THIRTEEN WHICH ALSO GETS HIS ULL TIME CREW -- BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN ON WHETHER IT IS A TWELVE MONTH COMMITMENT TWENTY FOUR MONTH COMMITMENT BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO BE A TO GET ORDERS IN HOW TO BE A TO GET STAFF TRAINED BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH AND I WOULD? HOPE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE TO SHOW CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE CAN GET BEYOND THAT THIRTEEN AND JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. IS THERE ANYONE SAYS WELL. STEPHEN BENSON HER AND FINANCES YOU SEE SIR LOOK FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S ABOUT THAT I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- WE'RE OF COURSE TRYING TO BALANCE OUR INVESTMENTS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS A FIRE PREVENTION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION AND SO. AND IS IN THE ENGINES ARE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONVERSATION EACH YEAR BUT HE'S GETTING TO THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN IN FUTURE YEARS BUT OVERALL. I COMMITTED TO CONTINUE -- AND AS THE LA -- SAD AND IN SOME WAYS IN THE MEDIA CRITICISM BUT ALSO JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE -- SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING ON WHAT'S UP WILDFIRES ARE JUST DIFFERENT THAN THEY HAVE BEEN AND MORE RECENT YEARS AND ARE MORE ACROSS SAID IN TERMS OF THE PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL IN. SOME OF THE STEPS OBSTACLES ON EMERGENCY SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT PATTERN WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NINE AND I SEE THAT SIGNAL AYE AYE INDIA AND TRULY IN. NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE I MEAN IT IS FANTASTIC THAT WHAT WE SEEM FOR THOSE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HIT AS HARD AND I ENTIRE DEPARTMENT FINANCING HAS BEEN WONDERFUL ESPECIALLY. WHEN YOU'RE ALL SO HANDS ON AND MAKING SURE THE COMMUTER ABLE TO RECOVER AND? WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE RECORD NUMBER BAKER SAID BURN THIS STATE SINCE? TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE ARE NOT VEN BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN THE MID SEVENTIES WHEN IT COMES A NUMBER OF ENGINES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD FOR CAL FIRE -- I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT AND I KNOW THAT IS COMMITMENT AND BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER THIS YEAR -- IN IS WHEN SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR STEM AND CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MY PLEASURE. MY COLLEAGUES -- I FIRST WANT TO APPLAUD YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WHEN I -- CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOUR YEARS AGO MY FIRST -- COMMITTEE HEARING WAS SITTING WITH THE YOU AND YOUR INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AND EXPERIENCE -- MAKES YOU THE THE THE STAR FOR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP BUT I'M I'M JUST DELIGHTED THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL HERE AND I SEE WAS A CONSTANT RESOURCE AS I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND SIR -- I HAVE TO AGREE WITH US SENATOR ROTH THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE NOW BETTER TO THE FIFTH BUDGET I'VE HEARD -- YOU HAVE GIVEN CERTAINLY THE MOST -- ARTICULATE -- SUMMARY OF A DOCUMENT I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH THE GOVERNOR THIS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO ENCAPSULATE HIS VISION - FOR WHAT HE WANTS TO SEE DONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY TODAY BUT IN THE FUTURE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE -- THE PRESENTATION WAS AS COMPLEX AS MY ABILITY TO RECITE YOUR NAME SO YOU FORGIVE ME. I CAN'T DO THAT SO -- BIBLE REFERRING YOU RESPECTFULLY AS SIR. BUT IF I ME UM ONE OF THE AREAS THAT SAW ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN OF MINE AND I KNOW A CONCERN OF MANY ON THIS -- IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE YOU DID LIEU TO TO MUCH IN YOUR BUDGET MY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD AND THAT'S A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED -- OUR PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO HELP WITH US AND REGIONAL CENTERS HAS BEEN DEFICIENT AND AS A RESULT IN MANY OF OUR REGIONAL CENTERS. MANY OF THESE PROVIDERS HAVE FALLEN OFF. AND I KNOW WE HAVE A STUDY IS GOING TO COME BACK IN MARCH -- AND I'M GONNA PREDICTED THAT CITIES GOING TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNDER PAYING THESE THESE PROVIDERS AND WE NEED TO STEP IT UP IF W'RE GOING -- TO GET THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND I'M BILLY I'M 1100% SUPPORT OF ALL THE EARLY HER CHILD EDUCATION PROGRAMS I APPLIED. THE GOVERNOR -- CERTAINLY -- FOR THAT -- BUT WE NEED TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET THAT IS GOING TO SHOW THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLE COMMUNITY THAT THEIR SERVICES THAT THEY EXPECT AND DESERVE. ARE GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM -- ALSO. ONE AREA THAT I'M SURE MANY OF US HERE ABOT HIS IT AND BY THE WAY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVESTMENT IN THE HOUSE AYE MERCER RESEARCH THAT'S WONDERFUL THAT TAKES CARE OF ARE GROWING ELDERLY POPULATION OF WHICH I'M A MEMBER OF NOW -- IN THEIR TWILIGHT YEARS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN WE NEED TO SEE A SIMILAR KIND OF INVESTMENT. IN THE RESEARCH OF AUTISM -- WHICH IS AFFECTING ALMOST ONE AND FORTY KIDS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TRULY -- IN EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS. AND I HOPE THAT AS YOU. WE WORK FURTHER ON THIS TEMPLATE OF A OF A BUDGET. THERE'S ALWAYS -- A DEGREE OF CONTENTION. WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD IS AUTISTIC IN A GOING TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SUMMER WELL PREPARED FOR THOSE AUTISTIC CHILDREN TO COME IN AND GIVE THEM THE CARE? AND EDUCATIONAL -- MEANS THAT THEY NEED THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR REGULAR POPULATION -- BUT THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO GIVE MORE GUIDANCE AND MORE FUNDS TO ENABLE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO JUST BASICALLY. NOT CLOSE THE DOOR ON THESE KIDS BECAUSE INVESTING IN THESE KIDS CAN REALLY MAN A LOT -- TO THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE ON THEIR OWN -- IN THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCH -- CERTAINLY SHOWS. SO I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR YOUR ON THE FUNDING THE DDS COMMUNITY -- PENDING THE BAR CHAU STUDIES AS MY FIRST QUESTION YES -- SO MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL -- THE FIRST IS ON DOWN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- IT'S DEFINITELY A PRIORITY FOR THE NEW GOVERNOR IT'S SOMETHING HE SPOKE IN A LOT ABOUT AND YOU KNOW I COULD SAY ON MY ON MY OWN IN A PREVIOUS ROLE I WORKED WITH TONY COELHO WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES. ACT AND YOU KNOW. HE EXPLAINED THE HISTORY OF THE LETTERMAN ACTOR IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO BE A PIONEER IN THE SPACE AND THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING. THAT WE WANT TO REMAIN -- AND CONTINUE DOING -- ON THE RATE STUDY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT'S COMING OUT -- THIS SPRING AND THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WILL BE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILD. ANY CHANGES INTO OUR BUDGET AND FORTUNATE OVER JUST WANNA MAKE ONE OR TWO OTHER. QUICK POINTS -- ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS -- IN THAT SET THREE MILLION AND IT'S ON THE RESEARCH SIDE BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SO MUCH THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE BRAIN BUT IT'S ALSO FOR THIS TASK FORCE THAT -- WE'RE HOPING THE GOVERNOR AND AND MARIA SHRIVER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES CAN COME TOGETHER ON HOW ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMITTEES WE CAN BILLS RESILIENCY AND MAKE SURE. THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE PREPARED THAT YOU CAN TAKE STEPS TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT THE ONES SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY AND THEN THE LAST THING IS SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING YOU KNOW WE BUILT IN. FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET BUT WE KNOW IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH -- WE KNOW THERE IS A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF AUTISM -- IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WE ALSO KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS PROVIDING SERVICES BUT THERE'S ALSO THE RESEARCH SIDE -- AND THE TIME YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE'S GONNA BE FOR THEI SUPPORT WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO WAYS TO SUPPORT ACROSS THAT WHOLE AREA AS WELL. ON IT SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE RATE STUDY AND ANY INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR DDS ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. I COULD AFTERNOON THERESA KELLER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS NOTED MULTIPLE TIME TO EXPECT A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT READ CITIES RELEASED IN MARCH. OF THIS YEAR AND AND BOTH HOUSES AND WE ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE -- ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS IN THE D. DECIDE SO -- BESIDES THE BEST BUDDIES AUGMENTATION THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE -- RESOURCES FOR INCREASED EM CASO RATIOS FIRST SPECIALIZED -- BEHAVIORAL AND MEDICAL NEEDS SO WORKERS HAVING A LOWER CASE LOAD. THEM. TO HELP WITH THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO M.. INCREASED RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES AND LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT TO CHILDREN IN THE THE DD SYSTEM AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF SPECIALIZED HOMES OF THOSE ARE ALREADY SOME INVESTMENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THEN AGAIN WE EXPECT -- MORE LIKE THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE RATE STUDY HAS RELEASED. HIS CURRENT PICK PIGGY BACK ON THAT YOU KNOW THE THE LAST PATIENT -- IN SONORA MY HAS LEFT NOW -- AND THERE WAS PROMISES MADE THAT THE PROPERTY WAS GOING TO BE UTILIZED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE DD COMMUNITY IS HAVE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR ABOUT HOW -- TO UTILIZE THAT PROPERTY IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT TO THE LAST -- CONSUMER WAS PLACED IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND RESOLUTIONS -- AND RIGHT THERE STILL -- FAIRVIEW AND THE GENERAL TREATMENT AREA PORT OF L. M. UP COMING IN THE FUTURE YEARS AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE PROPERTY CONTINUES SO I KNOW THAT THEIR ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY. MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE COUNTY. OKAY GREAT -- I WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT TOPIC IS OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND I I THINK IT'S A VERY BOLD -- IDEA FOR THE GOVERNOR -- TO AMASS OUR PURCHASES AND TO DISCOUNTS ON BEHALF OF THE THE STATE I WANTED TO SAY THAT I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR ROTH THAT -- THE THREE FORTY THE PROGRAM IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT -- IT'S DECIMATION CAN CAN CAUSE ACTUALLY HOSPITALS TO TO CLOSE ESPECIALLY SMALLER HOSPITALS THAT. ARE BOTH IN -- CENTER RAS DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT AND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO WE WE STAND UNITED AND HOPING TO PRESERVE THAT THAT PROGRAM -- BUT YOU'RE SAYING I ALSO DON'T WANT YOU TO RECREATE THE WHEEL BECAUSE THERE IS A MECHANISM OUT THERE ALREADY. BAD CAN -- GET THE ATTENTION -- CERTAINLY OF THE DRUG COMPANIES AND MAYBE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST FORM ITS OWN P. B. THIS THAT OUR NEXT THE DISCOUNTS THE DRUG COME. UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T ALWAYS THIS IS. FOR THESE -- MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY IS SET TO TAKE TAKE THE MONEY AND YOU KNOW -- PROVIDE GOOD RETURNS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS HIM WANT ONE COMPANY ALONE HAS OF THE MARKET VALUE OF FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. I'LL GUARANTEE THE NOT GETTING FIFTEEN CENTS A CLAIM FOR A PRESCRIPTION IT IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THAT. THAT HUB IF YOU WILL TO THE PBM ACTS AS A HUB EVERY PRESCRIPTION GOES THROUGH THAT HUB. TO ALL THE DIFFERENT -- INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE SO YOU MAY LOOK AT THE MODEL OF THE PBM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A WAY TO EXPEDITE THE POSITIONING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO GET INTO -- THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING -- THE COST OF MEDICATIONS IT'LL LOWER PRICE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS -- I'M A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF OF CLEAN WATER FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING COST OF THAT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE THE CASA PROVIDING -- THE BOTTLE WATER WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ULTIMATELY FINDING THE ETIOLOGY OF WHAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEMS IN THE SPECIFIED AREAS OF THE STATE AND THEN COMING UP OF TH CAPITAL BROUGH PLAN. TO FIX THEM WHETHER IT'S A JOINING THEM TO DIFFERENT WATER DISTRICTS AND INCENTIVIZE IN THE WATER DISTRICTS PROVIDE THAT CLEAN WATER. MY POINT HERE IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IN A STATE WHERE WE HAVE THIS MINIMAL COST IN COMPARISON TO OUR STATE BUDGET TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS THE MINIMUS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY OF OUR CITIZENS ESPECIALLY IN MY DISTRICT THEY'RE JUST TAX FATIGUE. AND WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT IT WATER TAX -- THE IF THEY FLIP OUT IS A REALLY ANOTHER TAX THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH -- WE HAVE BEEN -- CHARGING TAXES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WERE -- IT IN RECENT YEARS THAT WERE PROMISED TO BE TEMPORARY THAT BECAME PERMANENT SO WE HAVE A GOOD STRONG TAX REVENUE IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THIS GOVERNOR DIMMED. TO SOMEHOW TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE SO YOU KNOW OUR CITIZENS ARE TAX ENOUGH WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THIS THE WATER AND GUARANTEE THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA GETS CLEAN WATER. AND WE'RE GONNA INSURED THROUGH MONEY THAT IS DEDICATED -- THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL DO THAT AND THEN LASTLY. I WANT TO APPLY THE GOVERNOR ONCE AGAIN -- BECAUSE MANY OF US OR MAYBE USE A QUESTION MARK FOR MANY OF US WE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS GOING TO BE THE THE FISCAL HAWK YOU WILL THAT THE GOVERNOR BROWN SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE AND AND I HAVE TO APPLAUD HIM AS HE IS NOW DEPARTED. FOR THE ROOT ROBUST -- FUNDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR RESERVES IN THE EVENT A OF AN EMERGENCY -- SO I I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I SUPPORT THE THAT THE THE MONEY THAT IS GIVEN TO STIRS UP AND A REVENUE IS GONNA BE THE PENSIONS AND OVER WHAT THAT MONEY GOING TO THE CLASSROOM AND CERTAINLY GOING -- TO KERR'S -- THREE BILLION DOLLARS THIS ADDRESSES THE SYMPTOMS IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING IT ON A WOUND FOR PATIENTS GOT ANTI COAGULANT THERAPY. AND HAS NO WAY TO CLOT RIGHT CERTAINLY -- CENTER PAN UNDERSTANDS WHAT I'M SAYING WE NEED TO PROVIDE A BILL THAT'S GOING TO COST AND CLOUDY. AND THE WAY THAT WE WE WE MAKE THAT KILLED ACOSTA CLOTTING AS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A PENSION SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WORKS FOR THE WORKERS. BUT DOESN'T BECOME AN ONGOING LIABILITY FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT NEEDS TO BE A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION SO I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR SEES THIS IS -- STOPPING UP UP UP AN ACUTE PROBLEM BUT THERE ARE SOME CHRONIC ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO LINGER ON IF WE DON'T ADDRESS. SOME TYPE OF PENSION REFORMS THAT ARE TRUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT EVERY YEAR -- WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET HAVING LIKE A DECEMBER THAT IT HAD AND WONDERING LIKE I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY THAT. PURSE LOST TEN BILLION ONE DAY IN DECEMBER AND IT'S A LOT OF MONEY -- WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE STABLE -- MECHANISM OF ENSURING THAT OUR RETIREES GET WHICH PROMISE OF THEM BUT IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN AFFORD AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HOPE THE GOVERNOR WILL BE OPEN TO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATORS STERN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR PAN FINISH STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU MISTER VISWANATHA AUTONOMOUS CHIU FOR AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION -- PRETTY GOOD FOR YOUR FIRST AT BAT -- I I WANT TO DO RES. A STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT THAT A LINE WAS SOMEWHAT MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- TERMS OF RISK AND LONG TERM LIABILITIES IN THIS BUDGET. I REALLY PPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS -- ON TRYING TO BUY DOWN SOME THOSE DEBTS AND LIABILITIES I THINK WE YOU KNOW ROUGH NUMBERS WERE PUTTING -- YOU KNOW TWENTY BILLION ALMOST IN THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY SEVENTY FIVE BILLION LEFT IF YOU IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP FOR TWITTER SEVENTY TWO DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO THE MATH -- IN OUR DEBT RATIO IS STILL -- RATHER HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER LARGE POPULOUS STATES MAY THINK ONLY NEW YORK AND ILLINOIS ARE HIGHER BUT BUT WE'RE MAKING WE'RE CHIPPING AWAY AT IT -- BUT THE WAY THE WAY THIS BUDGET CATEGORIZES. THE CLIMATE CHANGE LIABILITY -- I I WOULD I WOULD COMMEND YOU. TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO REORGANIZE THAT THINKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WE SORT OF LIST DISASTER RELATED EXPENSES AS AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIGHT ITEM. BUT AS YOU YOURSELF SAID. THE DYNAMIC GENERAL FUND IMPACT -- WE WE KEEP INCURRING THESE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR -- COSTS YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH THE SFE YOU AS TO SORT OF RESPOND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING WHEN IT'S COMING. AND IT EATS INTO OUR BIGGER PRIORITIES WHICH I THINK ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. ALL THE INVESTMENT HIGHER EDUCATION -- HEALTH CARE. THESE ARE THESE YOUR EXPENSES THAT ACTUALLY PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE END A YIELD SAVINGS I I IG I WOULD ALSO SAY THOUGH THAT. THESE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE MEDICAID STIR SUPPRESSION ALSO HAVE SOME OF THOSE SAME ELEMENTS RIGHT SO. I'M WONDERING AS WE LEAD UP TO SAY THE NEXT FULL BUDGET HEARING MORE WE DIVE DEEPER INTO THE WILD FIRE ISSUE. IF WE CAN KIND OF SCOPE JUST PULL BACK THE SCOPE A LITTLE BIT. AT KIND OF CHANGES EMERGENCY IN THE STATE. AND IT'S BOTH THE HUMAN EMERGENCY IN A AND A FISCAL EMERGENCY -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTION FOR THIS YEAR LAST YEAR PROPERTY LOSS ALONE ON WE'LL SEE I MEAN ON ON ON THOMAS AND AND AND SOME OF THE OTHER FIRES WE WERE. ABOUT -- TWENTY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO STACK UP TO THIS YEAR I WAS INSURANCE WILL COVER SAMAN FEMA HAS A ROLE. BUT HAS THERE BEEN SORT OF ANY EFFORT. TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL LIABILITY -- TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SAME WAY WE SURE TO DO THAT FOR OTHER DEBTS AND LIABILITIES AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE RISK WRIT LARGE AND I WOULD JUST. I WOULD ASK IF IF NOT I KNOW WE'VE DONE IT SOME CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS OVER THE YEARS I BELIEVE WE FINISHED OUR FOURTH. LAST YEAR. IT'S THE DOCUMENT A SCIENTIFIC IN NATURE. BUT NOT FISCAL IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT REALLY OPERATES THROUGH DO F.. I'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE CONNECTIONS GET MADE MORE CLEARLY BETWEEN THAT RISK ASSESSMENT A SORT OF SCIENTIFIC IN AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEVEL AND AND AND THE FISCAL -- AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER WE CAN SORT OF PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT EITHER THE LA -- OR DO AT FOR BOTH -- TO BE HE LOOKS LIKE AN M.. BEFORE YOU ANSWER I JUST THE THE ONE CONCERN I DO HAVE AND I I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THIS IS HAZING BECAUSE THIS IS I'M A ROOKIE TO STILL BUT IT DIDN'T CONCERN METHAT. EVEN JUST THE OPENING OF THE RESOURCES SECTION OF THE BUDGET I'M LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY. WE'RE COPY AND PASTING FROM LAST YEAR LIKE DO YOU LOOK AT THE PAGE NINETY FIVE NINETY SIX IT ACTUALLY IS OUTDATED LIKE IT WAS SAYING. YOU KNOW IF IF APPROVED BY VOTERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS P. FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZE FOR BILLION IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS WILL THAT PASSED THAT WAS. PROP SIXTY EIGHT WHEN THAT MONEY'S HERE THEY MINISTRATION WILL CONVENE TARGET DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT CRIME RESILIENCY AN ADAPTATION -- IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE JUGGLING -- BUT THIS A BIG DEAL AND MATT I I DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE IT TOO MUCH CONSTERNATION BUT WE GOT TO UPDATE OUR PLAN HERE AND RECOGNIZE. THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY THAT REQUIRES THAT KINDA DILIGENCE AND HE HAS SAID JUST COMMENTS ON HOW TO SORT OF SCOPE THAT LIABILITY AND THEN. MAYBE A AN EDIT THEIR SO I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS PLEASE. I CAN WAIT AS WELL SO YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WITH RETIREMENT LIABILITIES AND WE HAVE A VERY ACTUAR WE DEFINE SYSTEM FOR HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK WHAT OF LIFE EXPECTANCY IS WATER INVESTMENT RETURN RATE IS HOW WE'RE DISCOUNTING THOSE LIABILITIES. TO THE PRESENT AND WHAT THEIR FINAL COMPENSATION WILL BE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD -- THAN WITH THE OPERATOR SO WE CAN MODEL ALL THAT AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BROADER CHANGES IN TERMS OF BOTH ADAPTATION AS WELL AS FOR CASTING WITH THE IMPACTS BE ON PEOPLE. WE DO NUMBER OF THOSE REPORTS BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPEAR IN OUR BUDGET SUMMARY ON A TABLE -- THE WAY RETIREE LIABILITIES DO ADMINISTRATION IT CERTAINLY WASN'T THE LAST ADMINISTRATION -- SINCE SOME WAYS WERE FOLLOWING IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND IT MIGHT BE DROWNED OUT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS ALONG WITH NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION YOU KNOW ONE OF SINGLE TO ISSUES THAT. HE'D USE I ADVISED YOU CORRECTLY THAT REALLY FRIGHTENED NEAR HUMAN EXISTENCE ON THIS PLANET ON BUT THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ONE OTHER PERSON I MENTIONED MY NAME AND DANCE ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE. ON THE CLIMATE SIDE WE HAVE CAKE COURT AND COMING AND COMING AND TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN. THAT OFFICE HAS BEEN USED BY MULTIPLE GOVERNOR'S IN DIFFERENT WAYS OVER DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS -- BUT IN GOVERNOR BROWN'S OFFICE WE HAD CAN OUR ACTS WHO WAS VERY BIG ON CLIMATE AND TRAVELING. WORLDWIDE AND HERE WITH KATE CORD AND SHE HAS A BACKGROUND WORKING AT NEXT GEN CLIMAX SHE WORKED AT THE PAULSON INSTITUTE WHICH ACTUALLY PUT OUT I BELIEVE THAT. KEY QUANTIFICATION REPORT -- WITH SOME FINANCIAL HEAVY HITTERS AND TING FALSE AND MICHAEL BLOOMBERG AND OTHERS -- SO SHE HAS THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND TO SEE HOW WE CAN QUANTIFY SOMEBODY'S RISKS ARE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A PRIORITY GOING FORWARD. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON OTHER WAYS WHERE WE CAN MAKE THAT RELY ON ONE THING THAT WE CERTAINLY. AGREE WITH GOVERNOR BROWN -- IS WHERE PEOPLE SAID WELL YOU KNOW YOUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT DON'T. ON ANOTHER CONTENT THANKS SO MUCH INTO THIS AND HE SAID THIS IS THREATENING ALL OF US IF WE DON'T ACT WHO WILL WE HAVE TO REAP THE WAY. AND IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T STEP UP STATES WILL DO THAT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION THANK -- IN REGARDS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE A SEPARATE -- NATURAL RESOURCES SECTION IN OUR BUDGET SUMMARY IN FACT IT WAS MERGED INTO EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS WHILE THE CAL FIRE IN CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS ITEMS WERE MERGED INTO THE BROADER ISSUE SO. I I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT DOCUMENT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT I'M PRETTY SURE -- IT WASN'T IN IN THAT SUMMER. OKAY. I GUESS THE POINT SORT OF MORE BROADLY IS. TO TO CONSIDER. THIS SORT OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IN THE CONCERT IS SORT OF BROADER INTEGRATED -- AND CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS. THAT I I'M IN OUR MENTALIST BUT I I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY IN THIS STATE AND SUFFERING AND AND IF THESE COSTS KEEP. JUMPING OUT AT US. THEY'RE GONNA EAT OUT FOLLOW. THE HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES HOLE AND I THAT THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE REALLY GET THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND SO -- AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED APPROACH ON THE CAL FIRE SITE IS WE TALK ABOUT FIVE PREVENTION IT CHECKS A BUNCH OF BOXES. ONE IS THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFITS OF HAVING A HEALTHY FORCES ARE A CARBON. NET CARBON -- THINK OF IT AS OPPOSED TO A CARBON EMITTER AND THAT'S WHY INVESTING IN THE FIRE PREVENTION HEALTHY FORESTS. NOT ONLY MAKE SENSE FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM A BROADER CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE INVESTMENTS -- IN FIRE PROTECTION -- TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES ADDITIONAL ENGINES. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN. HAVE A MORE ROBUST INITIAL ATTACK THAT PREVENTS THE FIRES FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC AS WELL WHICH ALSO HAS CLIMATE BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY SO I THINK WERE ABSOLUTELY ON THE SAME PAGE IN. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE THINGS IN A HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATIVE MANNER THANK YOU AND MISS YOU DID ANY COMMENTS HAVE YOU GUYS LOOKED AT THAT. THAT ISSUE SORT OF JUST TRYING TO QUALIFY BASED ON THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE WERE TO PROJECT OUT AND SAY INTO. TEN TWENTY YEARS AHEAD WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT WHAT WE FACING WITH THE BILL GOT MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO ARE COMING UP I THINK CAN COMMENT. ON THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE HAVEN'T DONE SORT OF THAT HOLISTIC -- ACOSTA COUNTY THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING BUT OKAY RANKING OFFER MORE. GOOD MORNING BRIAN BROWN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE A KNOW IT MISS HE SAID WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS AND IT IS -- YOU ALLUDED TO HIS FINANCE SPOKE TO THIS OF THE VERY COMPLICATED TYPE OF ANALYSIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO THINK -- BOTH ABOUT THE RANGE OF TYPES OF DISASTERS THAT CAN. THAT CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE OF THINKING BOTH ABOUT. WILDFIRES HE SPOKE ABOUT BUT ALSO SEALEVEL RISE AFFECT SOME FLOODING -- INCREASED DEATH AND IT -- RELATED -- TO INCREASED NUMBER OF EXTREME HOT DAYS THE WHOLE RANGE OF AFFECTS IT CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EACH ONE OF THOSE. HAVING EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT POPULATIONS DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE STATE -- DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVEN'T KNOWN IN THE TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE THE STATE AS A WHOLE. IN SO THAN TRYING TO THINK MOST ABOUT RENTAL COST TO MITIGATE THOSE EFFECTS AND IN THE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE DIFFERENT EVENTS HAPPENING SO. WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH -- THE ADMINISTRATION AND SEE WHAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND INTO A REPORT BACK TO YOU A VERY COMPLICATED ANALYSIS SO THEN I RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT THE SAME THING IS A TRADITIONAL SORT OF COST ACCOUNTING EXERCISE RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S RISK BUT THEN WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO RAIN OR WHEN. IT'S GOING TO BURN BUT GIVING US BALL PARKS YOU KNOW WE WITH WHETHER TIME AT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A TRILLION DOLLARS LIKE THE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE THAT THAT WOULD REALLY BE HELPFUL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE AND LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING LATE TODAY I I I DO -- ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT THEY CLOTTING CASCADE THE AN ANALOGY FOR PENSIONS CHALLENGES SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL -- I'VE FOR SO I WHAT THAT CERTAINLY WANT THANK -- BOTH -- MR HISPANA THEN AND SHOE FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- SO IT WILL BE DELVING MUCH MORE DEEPLY INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PIECES AND SUBCOMMITTEE AND I'M NOT GOING. TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE LIST OF WONDERFUL THINGS THAT SHEET THAT PRESENTATION -- WHAT? SOME I GUESS WHAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT IS -- SIR STRUCTURALLY SO FIRST OF ALL -- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S DONE THERE -- WITH THAT BEING SURE THAT -- WE STILL MAINTAIN RESERVE SO I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STOCK MARKET THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE ITSELF ADMITS THAT ITS THE -- POINT 1% OF GROWTH OFF EVERY WEEK AND WERE HALFWAY YEAH WE'RE WE'RE LIKE HOW MANY WEEKS NOW. FIVE SO THAT'S POINT FIVE YOU'RE GONNA HEAD OUT IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IS GOING TO BE 1% SEND MAIL AND AND MAYBE MORE THAN THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD -- FOR ANYONE AND INCLUDING US -- AND PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING CERTAINLY I THINK WE'LL AND WE'LL DEAL THAT WE GET TO THE MAY REVISE I'M SURE AS WELL SEE WHERE WE ARE. BUT THE OTHER THING ALSO ONE MAKE NOTICES AS WE LOOK AT OUR BUDGET YOU KNOW WE HAVE WHAT WE'RE ALLOCATING THE GENERAL FUND BUT ALSO FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS RATES -- WE GET 70% OF THE HEALTHCARE DOLLAR -- FROM -- REALLY FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MATCHES FOR THINGS THAT WE DO AND AND I THINK YOU MADE REFERENCE TO THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE REPLY FOR WAIVERS AND SO FORTH. SO I GUESS SO COUPLE THINGS AND RELATED TO THAT AND LOOKING AT PARTICULAR ON THE HOUSE PRIDE MORE SO IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AYE PAGODA HEALTH SIDE TERMS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DRAWING DOWN MORE FEDERAL MONEY SO ONE COURSES THE MTO TAX YOU MENTIONED. THAT LEASE IN THIS BUDGET -- AT LEAST RIGHT NOW THERE ISN'T A PROPOSAL TO RENEW THAT -- I HOPE WE CAN HAVE MORE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT THINK WAS MENTIONED THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE PER SE -- THERE THAT -- PERHAPS WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME INNOVATIONS THAT WILL ALSO CHIEF. I THINK OUR SHARED GOALS TO TRY TO EXPAND -- ONLY ACCESS BUT ALSO IMPROVE QUALITY THERE THAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT -- THAT WOULD ALSO BE IN LINE WITH WHAT -- MAYBE ENHANCING OUR CHRONIC DISEASE CARE OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES -- THE OTHER THING I ALSO BY MAKE NOTES I APPRECIATE -- THE EMPHASIS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION I UNDERSTAND GOVERNOR PUT MONEY IN FOR YOU SEE -- BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT. WE HAVE CSU AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE EVEN FEWER MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE IN TERMS OF STAFFING AND SO FORTH -- THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW ALSO -- WE INTEGRATE WITH OUR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MANY OF THESE -- STUDENTS PROBABLY ARE I MEAN THEY'RE NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY THEY'RE PROBABLY ON MEDI CAL AND HOW WE COULD LEVERAGE -- AGAIN ARE MEDI CAL PROGRAM TO HELP -- DRAW DOWN FEDERAL MONEY TO HELP SUPPORT EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES -- IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SO THINK ABOUT -- OUR COMMUNICATORS AND ALL SOURCE -- BUT ALSO -- CS USES WELL AND AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE PUT MONEY INTO -- YOU SEE. THE OTHER WHAT I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS IS THAT -- BALL LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY RIGHT NOW -- IS MADE REFERENCE -- TO WE HAD A STRIKE DOWN LA S. T. -- AND I THINK PEOPLE MAKE NOTE THAT -- THE ISSUE ISN'T ENTIRELY SALARY IT'S ACTUALLY HE CLASS SIZE BUT THEN ALSO SUPPORT STAFF SCHOOL NURSES PSYCHOLOGISTS SO FORTH -- WE SEE AT HERE IT'S ECONOMIC VERY ON DISTRICTS SEXY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT STRUGGLING. WITH THEIR FINANCES AS WELL AND WHERE DO YOU CUT BACK ON THINGS AND WE SHOULD BE HELPING OUT MORE BY SAYING THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THROUGH OUR MEDI CAL WE SHOULD THE GOVERNOR AGAIN. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT IN MORE MONEY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT -- BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAXIMIZE THOSE DOLLARS RATES ARE MEDI CAL ELLIE A IN MY MONEY. WE ARE AT EIGHTEEN IS A RECENT REPORT SHOWED THAT WE ARE FORTY FIRST IN PUPIL A PER PUPIL SPENDING FOR SCHOOL HEALTH AND SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT RIGHT -- WE ARE WHAT THE LOWEST IF NOT THE LOWEST STATES IN TERMS THE AMOUNT OF MAY. BE MEDI CAL ELLIE A MONEY THAT WE DRAW DOWN -- SO WHY IS IT WHY CAN'T WILL HE STILL -- THAT DO BETTER AT COMPARED. TO THE OTHER STATES THAT THAT IS FEDERAL MONEY LEóN TABLES AND ALL THOSE WE HAVE STATE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING IN WILL COUNTY LOCAL MONEY WE SHOULD BE TRYING THOSE MATCHES DOWN WHY. ARE OUR DEPART HEALTHCARE SERVICE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THAT THE PART TO SAY YOU KNOW WE WHY ARE WE LEAVING THIS MONEY ON THE TABLE WE SHOULD BE PULLING THAT MONEY IN. SO -- PERHAPS I'M GONNA ASK EACH OF YOU TO PASS SPEAK TO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT AND AGAIN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE TO EVEN MORE. WITHOUT EVEN SPENDING MORE FROM -- THE STATE BUT DRYING DOWN THOSE FED OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE FEDERAL MATCHES BUILD ON FOOT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A WITH MORE RESOURCES SO PERHAPS THAT MAYBE THE DRAGONFLY FINANCES BE FIRST IN A LA -- CAN AT TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAD A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. ALL MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS BEFORE TURNING OVER TO THIS YEAR -- THE FIRST IS ON A MENTAL HEALTH. IS A PRIORITY BUT AS YOU KNOW MUCH MORE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAT WE CAN DO AND ONE THING IN THIS ISN'T SPECIFICALLY ON PROGRAM FUNDING -- BUT THE GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED -- TO APPOINTING A VERY HIGH LEVEL ADVISER IN MENTAL HEALTH SOMEONE WHO IS A TRUE LEADER IN THE FIELD NATIONALLY SO -- YOU SHOULD BE HEARING ARE WE ALSO BE HEARING WHO THAT PERSON IS AND WHAT THAT PERSON CAN DO A VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. COUPLE WEEKS -- SO THAT'S ONE POINT AND THEN I THINK ON SECOND POINT MORE BROADLY ON MEDI CAL I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS AND I THINK FOR MANY OF US. IT WAS REALLY WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IN JEOPARDY DURING THE SUMMER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN MARKET SOMEONE MULTIPLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR. THAT WE REALLY SAW HOW DEPENDENT THE STATE BUDGET IS. ON FEDERAL HOW YOU PLAY IT IT'S ALMOST 80% OF OUR OVERALL MEDI CAL BUDGET AND HOW WE CAN DO EVEN MORE AND SO ONE PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET IS. SEEING OTHER WAYS AND WE WE CAN DRAW DOWN MEDI CAL AND OTHER SOCIAL SIR THE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT FAMILY PLANNING THE FACT PROGRAMS AND THAT'S THE WAY I BELIEVE I NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STRUCTURE-BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ALMOST NINE OR TEN TO ONE MATCH. YES CORRECT SO I THINK YOU'LL BE PUTTING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD DRAW DOWN ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- AND AND THIS IS MORE IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE BUT FOR SSI THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS A WAY TO GET MUCH MORE SO DEFINITELY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE IN OTHER. PROGRAMS WITHIN MEDI CAL HOW WE CAN GET ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS WE KNOW IN OUR OVERVIEW. BY NOT -- EXTENDING THE MCO TAX WE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE IS FOR GOING ABOUT UP ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE A DIRECT GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. ON WHEN YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS -- REGARDING AND MEDI CAL DRAWDOWN FOR FOR SCHOOLS ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE MORE FULLY IT'S NOT ONE WERE PREPARED TO COMMENT ON RIGHT NOW. AND AND SO I JUST AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL THAT'S WHEN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WHILE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BETTER DIRECT THAT I ALSO JUST NEED TO MENTION -- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR ALSO -- TRYING TO RE DIRECT -- PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY -- TOWARD THE PURPOSES OF THE AND APPRECIATE THAT STEP BY -- THE VEGAS GOVERNOR THANK YOU IT MADE THAT COMMITMENT ON THE CAMPAIGN SO FROM THE GET GO THAT WAS GOING TO BE IN THIS BUDGET AND ULTIMATELY DELTA IMPROVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE SO WE WANT EXPAND ACCESS BUT WE ALSO. BE SURE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON OUR STATE PROGRAM OUR STATE SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM ACTUALLY MEDI CAL AS YOU CAN ACCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR PAN AND I WANT TO ECHO YOUR POINT AS WELL AS SENATOR DORADO AND I'M HOPING THAT AT ONE OF YOUR SUBCOMMITTEES THAT YOU WE CAN GET -- SOME DETAILS -- REGARDING -- WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY HAS A COST ESTIMATE OF COVERING ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS AND SENIORS -- REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS -- IN ADDITION TO THE IN ADULTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED -- AND HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS TWENTY SIX AN OLDER WOULD BE INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT FOR THE IMMIGRATION STATUS ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I SAW IN THE DOCUMENTS HOW MANY PEOPLE. ON WE WERE ACTUALLY GONNA COVER. UP I WILL CLOSE THE SAP LIKE IT'S ASKING A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- I'M NOT GONNA BE REDUNDANT WITH WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ASKED BUT IT WAS ONE ISSUE THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYONE SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED IN THAT HAVE TO DO WITH. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. YOU KNOW IT WE TREAT EDUCATION AS A CONTINUUM IN EVERY OTHER AREA EXCEPT EASY. AND SO WE'RE CLEAR CASE TO FOURTEEN IT'S A CONTINUUM OF CARE AND SO WILL I FULLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE. THE INTEREST -- AND THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. IN PRESCHOOL FOR ALL I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE AREA -- ON AT WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL YOU KNOW WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE WAS ADDITIONAL SLOTS. FOR ZERO THREE ZERO AS I TOLD THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION CHILDREN AREN'T BORN SCHOOL AGE BABIES ARE BORN PRESCHOOL READY -- THE STATE HAS -- A REAL ISSUE AROUND AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE AND FOLLOW WHILE I AM THRILLED ABOUT SUCH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S. YOUNGEST RESIDENTS -- IN JANUARY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO WAIT TO STRUGGLE TO GET THERE IN MAY -- I DO WANT TO TALK REALLY ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS NOTION OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IGNORING THE ZERO TO THREE YEAR OLDS -- IN LIEU OF A VISION AROUND PRESCHOOL FOR ALL SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE A FULLER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BUT REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE ISSUE -- ONE QUICK QUESTION I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO ANSWER FOR ME UNDER CALIFORNIA'S TO NAY COMMISSION. WOULD THE INCREASE ACCESS AWARD AMOUNT IMPACT THOSE STUDENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER STATE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE CAL WORKS TANITH. WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE WE CREATE A CLIFF AFFECT WE GIVE THE MORE AID AND THEY DROP OFF THESE OTHER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SO WOULD THAT INCREASE. COMPROMISE THEIR ELIGIBILITY. RIGHT SO I WILL I'LL BRIEFLY TOUCH N THE ZERO TO THREE AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS ON THE STUDENT AID AND PERFECT AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES OKAY. QUICK POINTS ON FIRST -- AS YOU KNOW ONE GOOD THING IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S ON COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES IS THAT THE NEW CHIEF OF STAFF AND ALL LERI -- THIS IS HER LIFE'S WORK AND TERMS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN MAKING SURE -- I THINK SHE'S MORE FAMILIAR THAN ANYONE MONEY YOU'VE GOT THE PRESCHOOL PEOPLE VERSUS THE CHILD CARE PEOPLE IN YOUR AS FAMILIAR WITH THIS AS ANYONE CITING ONE PRIORITY OF THIS BUDGET WAS MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AND IT'S NOT SIMPLY FIGHTING. FOR SCRAPS OF DOLLARS HERE AND THERE BUT IT'S ALL CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT OUR PRESCHOOL INVESTMENT WHICH AS YOU KNOW IT IS ALMOST A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- BUT WE ALSO SEE YOU KNOW THERE ARE IN OTHER FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK CITY HAS UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLD SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOW EXTENDING TARA THREE YEAR OLD TUNE IN THE STATE BUDGET WE DON'T HAVE THAT ROOM YET ITS ASPIRATIONAL. BUT WE'RE HOPING FOR ZERO TO THREE BETWEEN THE HOME VISITING. AND THE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE WHICH WILL BE A LONGER TERM PROPOSITION BUT WHEN THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT WILL PAVE THE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING KIDS NOT JUST ONCE THEY TURN FOUR YEARS OLD BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT AN EXCELLENT WE WILL. CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE OTHER ISSUE WITH REGARD TO PRESCHOOL IS IN A PRESCHOOL -- ARE STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS NOW OR UNDER UTILIZED BECAUSE STATE PRESCHOOL IS THREE HOURS. AND I DON'T KNOW MANY WORKING MOMS WHO QUALIFY FOR STATE PRESCHOOL WHO HAD THE LUXURY OF ONLY WORKING THREE HOURS A DAY. AND SO IF THE PROGRAM DOESN'T INCLUDE -- WRAPAROUND AND FULL DAY OPTIONS ONCE AGAIN THIS INVESTMENT WILL NOT HAVE BE AND THE WHY THIS WEEK OF MAY BECAUSE IT'LL GO UNDER YOU LIES IN STATE PRESCHOOL DOLLARS WILL COME BACK. AT THE END OF THE YEAR LIKE THEY HAVE DONE. FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE UTILIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT MEETING THE CURRENT NEED OF THE WORK FORCE SELF I'LL LOOK FOR TO HAVE THAT ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. AND WE KNOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE EVEN WITH KINDERGARTEN LET ALONE PRESCHOOL ABSOLUTELY BUT ONE POINT I WILL MAKE IS THIS NEW MONEY FOR PRESCHOOL THESE ARE FOR FULL DAY FOR YOUR PRESCHOOL SLOTS. EXCELLENT YES AND ON CHRIS ON THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CERTAINLY. SO WILL -- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON THE QUESTION MY A CODED MEMO THE CAME FROM KIM JOHNSON AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THINK IT WAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN CLARIFIED THAT CAL GRANTS THAT ARE PROVIDED -- TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND WAR CALPERS PROGRAM ARE EXEMPT FROM THE INCOME SIDE OF THAT EQUATION. AND DO NOT IMPACT -- BUT WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- ON THAT ASPECT. I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] FIFTY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT AS WE INCREASE THE CHAFEE GRASSES THAT DOESN'T COMPROMISE THEIR OTHER OKAY. WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WELL LAST QUESTION FOR ME DEALS WITH CAL FRESH VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. OF TWO QUESTIONS -- WHAT EFFORTS -- HAS THE ADMINISTRATION GAUGE AND TO ENSURE THAT RECIPIENTS RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS WITH THIS LITTLE DESTRUCT DESTRUCTION AS POSSIBLE DESPITE THE SHUT DOWN DO YOU HAVE A PLAN AND AND CAN THE LEGISLATURE BE HELPFUL. SO ON CAL FOR SPECIFICALLY WE BELIEVE -- AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL THAT -- MONEY -- AFTER JANUARY TWENTIETH WHICH IT WITH THREE DAYS FROM NOW ON SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND BENEFITS THROUGH THE END OF FEBRUARY THAT'S OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE SO IT GIVES US FIVE OR SIX WEEKS. ON THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FITS CON MAN -- FOR IN TERMS OF BENEFITS DELIVER TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH -- SO IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND IT'S DIFFERENT FROM UNEMPLOYMENT WHERE -- THERE'S THE MONEY FLOWS DIFFERENTLY SO WE ARE EVALUATING OPTIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAD MEETINGS ON THE SHUT DOWN YESTERDAY -- IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN JUST YET FOR POST FEBRUARY BUT WORK CLOSELY MONITORING HOW I CAN ADD ADDITIONAL DETAIL. THAT COVERS MOST THE TYRANTS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST THEY WERE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTION THESE ARE FEDERAL BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE TO BE ABLE. TO CONTINUE FULLY FINING THEM THROUGH FEBRUARY AS FAR AS A CONTINGENCY PLAN ON GOING AFTER THAT. LED TO FIGURE OUT IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE SHUT DOWN IS GOING TO CONTINUE OKAY [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] SENATE BILL. WELL JUST. THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FOOD ISSUE IS A CRISIS OF MAGNITUDE OF HUGE MAGNITUDE IF THIS WHOLE THING CONTINUES. OUR WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE THE COMMUNITY TO GET FOOD TO PEOPLE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOOD YOU STARVE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO GET THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZED -- I WAS A LITTLE BOY MY MOM USED TEN KIDS BUT SHE ON SUNDAYS WOULD GO. AND WE WOULD DELIVER BAGS OF FOOD [inaudible] TWO PEOPLE. AND I WAS SERVE THE NAVIGATOR SHE WOULD SAY ARCHIE SO WHERE I GO NEXT GENERAL CHIT A LIST OF HOMES [inaudible] AND LEHRER -- I ASKED HER ABOUT IT WHEN I GOT OLDER AND I SAID WELL. HOW TO THEIR WORK SHE SAID I SAID THERE IS? SHE HAD WITH SHE SAID WE HAD AS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION THE LOWER THE THAT ONE AROUND. GOD PEOPLE TO DONATE THE FOOD. AND THEY WOULD GET IT IN BAGS. AND THEN THEY WOULD LOADED IN THE CAR AS THEY HAD A LINE UP OF CARS THAT COME IN. THEY LOAD UP THE CARS AND THEN THEY TAKE IT TO PEOPLE'S HOMES. AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW THE AT OUR CAR. AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T EVER I WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD. SHE SAID IT WAS SAYS ARE TRAVIS. IN SAN JOSE. WHEN HE WAS -- SO USED TO LOAD GROCERIES IN MY MOM'S CAR. HISTORY CALIFORNIA THERE IS A RENEWED IMMOBILIZING. THE LEAGUE WE THAT WE GOT TO GET THE COMMUNITY. MOBILIZED TO FOOD BANKS ALL THE NOTE THE THE SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HAVING ANY KIND OF FOOD. PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S OF THAT SORT ESSENTIAL. FRANTICALLY FOR THE TOWER CAN. CORRECT ME BUT I THINK ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING CALPERS BENEFITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS NOT ONLY IS THAT YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE STATE EMPLOYEES. I BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF FEDERAL WORKERS -- FOR WHAT NATIONALLY YES THAT'S THE SCALE OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THEM AT THE SAME TIME THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE TO GO ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS YOU'RE TALKING SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TAX GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE WAY THAT. PROGRAM STRUCTURE COMPARED TO EVEN TEMPORARY BUT MORE COMPLICATED TO IMAGINE HOW THAT CAN BE REIMBURSED ON AND EVEN IN A BUDGET AS ROBUST AS OURS YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN ABSORB THAT KIND OF HIT OVER MULTIPLE MINE SO I THINK IT REALLY IS SOMETHING AS YOU. MENTIONED SENATOR WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NON PROFITS AND MAYBE SOME OF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS CAN STEP UP AND THEN OF COURSE AND I THINK YOU KNOW MOST OF US IN AGREEMENT HERE. PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE IN WASHINGTON DC TO AND YEAH OF BUGS IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS TO NOT HAVE TO GET THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S THAT'S THE ANSWER. IN SPEAKING WITH REGARD TO CAL FRESH -- AND AND THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION HERE YOU KNOW WE TOOK ACTIONS -- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT MADE SSI RECIPIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL CALVET COW FOR ACTION SO WE YOU KNOW WE LIMIT THE M. S. I. CASH OUT POLICY. AND SO CAN YOU GIVE US ANY BRIEF UPDATE AS WERE TALK ABOUT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT CALIBRATION WHO COULD BE AT RISK. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY -- I HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS EXPERIENCED IN IMPLEMENTING THAT. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THE ONE POINT IN THAT THIS TO BUDGET IS DIFFERENT AS MAKING IT ON GOING RATHER THAN ONE TIME AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE ONE TIME FUNDS WERE USED TO KIND OF Q. US UP FOR NOW THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF THE POLICY SO HOW'S IT GOING. IT SOUNDS LIKE -- THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS THAT WE WILL BE READY TO GO AT THIS MOMENT -- IMPLEMENTATION SEEMS TO BE READY WERE STAGED UP TO GO. I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST IN THAT THEY SHUT DOWN WILL NOT DISRUPT ANYTHING RELATED IMPLEMENTATION JUNE FIRST. AND IF THIS FALLS UNDER DOCTOR PAN SUB THREE IF IT LOOKS. IF IT BECOMES APPARENT BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN THAT THAT JUNE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION DATE WILL BE DELAYED IF YOU'D BE PROACTIVE IN INFORMING US TO THE SUB COMMITTEE I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. SEEN NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
