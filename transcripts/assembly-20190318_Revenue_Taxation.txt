AFTERNOON WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- WE HAVE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THE FIRST ITEM. IT'S ME AB. TWO SIXTY THREE AS CHAIR SAID WE'RE GONNA START FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB. TWO SIXTY THREE BY CHAIRWOMAN BURKE AND SHE CAN -- BEGIN WHENEVER SHE'S READY MADAM CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AB TWO SIXTY THREE WILL EXPAND THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER REVENUE AND TAX CODE SECTION FORTY ONE TO ALL TAX EXPENDITURES UNDER THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX LAW. AND CORPORATION TAX LAW EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT ALL NEW TAX CREDITS CONTAINS SPECIFIC GOALS PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES ALONG WITH DETAILED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO USE. WHEN EVALUATING THE TAX CREDIT EFFECTIVENESS WE THINK THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS WHY THIS COMMITTEE HAS MADE A PRACTICE TO IMPOSE THEM ON ALL NEW TAX EXPENDITURES NOT JUST TAX CREDITS? AND ALTHOUGH ANY NEW BILL CAN EXEMPT ITSELF FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL WILL SERVE AS A BENCHMARK ON THAT MAKES US BETTER STEWARDS OF OUR BUDGETARY RESOURCES WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I WILL. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAMANTHA CORBIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- THE MEASURE INTRODUCED BY MISTER LENO OR PASSED BY MISTER LENO EXCUSE ME -- THAT THAT PUT SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ON LAW WE WE HAVE SEEN AN ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IT HAS. GIVEN LEGISLATURE'S THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS ADVOCATES VERY VALUABLE TOOLS AS THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODIES VALUES AND ABOUT THE STATE'S VALUES. IN FACT PART OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR IS GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE TIME PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ONE SENATOR LENO. I HAD INTRODUCED HIS ORIGINAL MEASURE. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IS BECAUSE THE HERE'S THE MEASURES THAT DID NOT HAVE METRICS THE MEASURES THAT WERE CHAPTER IN -- THAT DID NOT HAVE SUN SETS THE BY AND LARGE HAVE GONE ON TOUCHED FROM ABOUT NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LEAVING. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PERHAPS. A RONI AS TAX CREDITS AN EXEMPTION ON THE BOX SO WE SEE THIS IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION OF THE LAND I LOST SOMETHING VERY VALUABLE THAT NOT ONLY COMMITTEES LIKE YOURS -- BUT THE ENTIRE BODY CAN USE AND SETTING THE VALUES OF THE STATE THROUGH THE BUDGET AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE IN SUPPORT APPRECIATE THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I CAN -- UP JUST REAL QUICKLY WE HAVE A FEW OTHER MEMBERS HERE AND WE WANT TO ESTABLISH COR. NOT A CLERK [inaudible] BURKE HERE [inaudible] ROBERT [inaudible] TO GREAT [inaudible] MAYES. LENDERS WILL [inaudible] ONE PETRIE-NORRIS QUIRK HERE. REVERSE [inaudible] TING. CORD BELLCORE MY APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE DON'T YET HAVE AN OFFICIAL SUPPORT POSITION WE WILL HAVE ONE CODIFIED -- AT OUR MEMBERS MEETING NEXT WEEKEND -- BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY -- CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES AND VISIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- WORKING TOWARDS WE VERY MUCH SITE THAT THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE WE DO BELIEVE THAT PAUL TAX CREDITS AND TAX EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN CREATED TO PROVIDE AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA. IS WELL IS TO CREATE INCENTIVES TO CREATE PARTICULAR GOALS AND OUTCOMES IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOCUS ON THESE AREAS ARE BEING WELL SPENT TO JUSTIFY THE REDUCTIONS IN CRITICAL EDUCATION AND PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAMS. HAS 40% OF EVERY DOLLAR A TAX CREDIT IS CREEK THAT IS CREATED ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE GONE TO FIND CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO WE APPRECIATE THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC OVERSIGHT THIS MEASURE WILL ACHIEVE. MOVE THE BILL. WELL MOTION BY MISTER GRAY A SECOND MEMBERS QUIRK WILL ASK FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] SEEING NONE [inaudible] WITNESSES OPPOSITION. XENON BRAVE ACTUALLY DíAS VENOM LIKE. TO MISTER BANKS YEAH I JUST WANT THEM TO SUPPORT THIS -- TODAY -- BUT PROBABLY NOT FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT MANY OF YOU MIGHT THINK YEAH -- I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL THESE TAX EXPENDITURES -- LIKE IS WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF OUR OF OF OF TAXING. OF CITIZENS IS TO PROVIDE NECESSARY OF SERVICES -- TO THE TO THE PUBLIC AND EVERY TIME YOU HAVE ONE CREDIT OR ANOTHER YOU ARE IN ESSENCE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS -- AND IF WE DON'T HAVE SOME MECHANISM BUT PLACE IT SAYS THERE'S SOME REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD REASON. FOR THAT THEN I'M NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD IN THE COUNTRY I THINK THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE HE AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER. CREDITS AND SO FORTH SO I THINK THIS MAKES A AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE A PROBABLY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS -- BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THEY GIVE US MAYES WAS COURT -- I TAKE THE POSITION THERE SHOULD BE NO TAX DEDUCTIONS. TAX DEDUCTIONS. FAVOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE. FAVOR THE RICH. IF YOU HAVE A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR HOME AND YOU'RE BEING TAXED AT 13%. YOU GET A LOT MORE MONEY BACK THAN SOMEBODY WHO A BARELY PAYS TAXES ALL THIS PAIN IT 23%. SO IN MY OPINION THE ULTIMATE REFORM WOULD BE TO GET RID OF ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS. NOW I'M SURE CHAD YOU'D WANT THAT TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT. EXCUSE ME THE MAYOR FROM PALM DESERT. NOW WELL WHATEVER. SHE'S [inaudible] AMBER WEDDING. CLOSE ENOUGH -- BUT TAX DEDUCTIONS ARE BREAKS FOR THE RICH WE OUGHT TO GET RID OF THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIGITAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE -- TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THIRTY THREE TODAY. WATER CONSERVATION AND STORM WATER PROGRAM REBATES AND INCENTIVES ARE DESIGNED TO REIMBURSE HOUSEHOLDS WERE EXPENSES INCURRED TO UPGRADE APPLIANCES. INSTALL CISTERNS OR REMOVE AND REPLACE THEIR LAWNS WITH DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANTS. HOWEVER THESE REBATE FUNDS THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS ARE POTENTIALLY TAXABLE UNDER STATE LAW. AB FIVE THIRTY THREE PROVIDES CLARITY UNCERTAINTY FOR WATER AGENCIES THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS. CONSUMERS WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF ISSUING TEN NINETY NINES OR CONCERNS THAT THEIR CONSUMERS WILL BE DISCOURAGED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THESE. IMPORTANT PROGRAMS BY AN ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN. WE MUST CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT INCENTIVIZE WATER CONSERVATION AND EXTENDING TAX RELIEF ON ALREADY PROVEN PROGRAMS AS A WIN FOR CALIFORNIA. AND CONSUMERS. I WOULD DEFER THE REST OF MY TIME -- TO MY SPONSORS WHO ARE HERE TO SHARE WHY THIS BILL IS CRITICAL. TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE WITH ME -- KATHY BY TELE. BE A TELE. OFFER METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY CYNTHIA KOHLER. FROM WATER NOW ALLIANCE AND SIR FOLEY FROM CALIFORNIA WATER EFFICIENCY PARTNERSHIP. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CATHY VIA TELEPHONE AND I'M WITH THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A COALITION LETTER OF THIRTY SIX SIGNATORIES REPRESENTING WATER AGENCIES BUSINESSES TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND NON PROFITS COMMITTED TO TO WATER CONSERVATION AS A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE. WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR A BI FIVE THREE THREE MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WE WISH TO THANK. MR HOLDEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND FOR A THREE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE FROM GROSS INCOME ANY AMOUNT RECEIVED AS A REBATE VOUCHER OR OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. ISSUED BY A LOCAL WATER AGENCY OR WATER SUPPLIER FOR EXPENSES INCURRED TO PARTICIPATE IN UTTER FOR MOBILE WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM FOR STORM WATER RUNOFF. IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM SINCE NINETEEN NINETY METROPOLITAN HAS INVESTED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND MAIL EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES AND OTHER CONSERVATION INCENTIVES. THE RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED WATER SAVINGS OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET ENOUGH TO PROVIDE WATER FOR NEARLY NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. METROPOLITAN SO CAL WATER SMART PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TWENTY SIX MEMBER AGENCIES. PROVIDES RESIDENTIAL AND CORPORATE REBATES THE TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL REBATES INCLUDE HIGH EFFICIENCY TOILETS CLOTHES WASHERS AND HIGH EFFICIENCY SPRINKLER NOZZLE SOIL MOISTURE SENSORS AND WATER BASED IRRIGATION CONTROLLERS. WE ALSO PROVIDE REBATES FOR RAIN BARRELS AND CISTERNS. AND JANUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE DROUGHT METROPOLITAN EDITOR FOR MOBILE TO OUR PROGRAM. IT WAS OUR MOST POPULAR WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAM AND IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE EXTENDED THAT PROGRAMMING CALLED AT THE LANDSCAPE TRANSFORM TRANSFORM PROGRAM. METROPOLITAN HAS A GOAL TO SAVE A HUNDED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR BY TWENTY FORTY AND WE ARE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS TOWARD THIS GOAL THROUGH THE SO CAL WATER SMART PROGRAM. BUT WE ACHIEVE MORE CONSERVATION BY FOCUSING ON OUTDOOR WATER USE OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED FIFTY MILLION FOR TOURNEFORT REBATE PROGRAM IN FEBRUARY THEY INCREASE THE TURF REBATE FROM A DOLLAR PER ACRE TO TWO DOLLARS PER ACRE FOOT. I'M SORRY PER ACRE ALONG WITH SOME OTHER CHANGES TO INCENTIVIZE GREATER. PARTICIPATION. TURF REPLACEMENT REBATES HAVE BENEFITTED FROM A TAX EXEMPT EXEMPTION THANKS TO AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR FROM FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER GOMEZ ENACTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN HOWEVER THAT EXEMPTION SUNSET AT THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR WATER SAVING TOILETS AND CLOTHES WASHERS. MAKING THE TAX EXCLUSION FOR TURF REMOVAL PERMANENT OR EXTENDING ANOTHER FIVE YEARS WILL PROVIDE RELIEF TO STATE TAXPAYERS AND COULD ENCOURAGE GREATER PARTICIPATION ENTER FOR MOBILE PROGRAMS. WHILE THE SOUTH PLAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FACE VERY ABLE ECONOMIC AND HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE THE REGION HAS ESTABLISHED A SOLID FOUNDATION -- FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN CONSERVATION AND EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY THREE CAN PROVIDE CONTINUED RELIEF TO STATE TAXPAYERS TO FURTHER FACILITATE STATEWIDE GOALS. TO LOWER WATER USE FOR THESE REASONS METROPOLITAN AND ARE SIGNATORIES TO OUR COALITION LETTER SUPPORT AB FIVE THREE THREE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE. TO LOOK FAVORABLY UPON THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SERRA FULLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATER EFFICIENCY PARTNERSHIP A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF TWO HUNDRED WATER UTILITIES. NGOS AND CONSERVATION PROFESSIONALS. WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION THE FORMER STATE INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR TURF REPLACEMENT AS YOU JUST HEARD REBATES. EXPIRED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS BILL GIVES A NEW STATE INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR WATER EFFICIENCY REBATES IN GENERAL AND FOR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WATER RESOURCES AND CONSUMER SHOULD NOT BE PERSONALLY TAXED FOR PROVIDING A STATEWIDE BENEFIT. WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING A FEDERAL TAX EXEMPTION AS WELL. ENERGY EFFICIENCY REBATES HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX FOR DECADES. DOING THIS FOR WATER EFFICIENCY PROVIDES PARITY WITH WHAT ALREADY EXISTS IN ENERGY. ONCE THIS BILL IS PASSED AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS TEN NINETY NINES WILL NO LONGER NEED TO BE SENT BY WATER UTILITIES. TO CUSTOMERS WHO GET SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE REBATES IN A CALENDAR YEAR. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND URGE THE THANK YOU. IF YOU HAD TO TESTIFY SO IF YOU COULD BE BRIEF I WILL BE. VERY BRIEF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M CYNTHIA COLOR WITH THE WATER NOW ALLIANCE -- WE ARE A NATIONAL NETWORK OF WATER UTILITY LEADERSHIP -- SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT WATER SOLUTIONS AND ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF MR HOLDINGS BILL AB FIVE THIRTY THREE WHAT I'LL ADD TO MY COLLEAGUES TESTIMONY IS THAT -- WE SEE THAT CONSUMER PARTICIPATION IN DECENTRALIZED WATER -- TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES IS ESSENTIAL TO THE STATE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS OF WATER RESILIENCE AND BY THAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING NOT ONLY ABOUT TURF BUT ABOUT GRAY WATER SYSTEMS LEAK DETECTION DEVICES. THAT ARE ALL FAIRLY EXPENSIVE WE KNOW THAT UTILITY PARTICIPATION UTILITIES ABILITY TO HAVE CONSUMER REBATES IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE TAX BOARDS ANALYSIS -- AND FEEL THAT IT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER STATED THE LIKELY LOSS. IN REVENUE TO THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THIS PROHIBITION I'M REALLY PROGRAMS OF COURSE ARE VOLUNTARY WE CANNOT FORCE PARTICIPATION AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT -- PEOPLE THAT PERCEIVE A TAX -- A PENALTY WILL NOT HURT SINCE OF THIS PROGRAM IS A CAP WILL BE WE'VE BASICALLY SAYING UTILITIES ARE CAPPED TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS TO WHICH SHE WATER EFFICIENCY WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WE WILL. THEN WE WILL NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT AB FIVE THIRTY THREE IS THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S LONG STANDING RECOGNITION ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO USE CONSUMER REBATES TO ADVANCE NOT ONLY THEIR OWN BUT STATE WIDE. RESILIENCE AND WATER EFFICIENCY GOALS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND I'M HAVE TO LEAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN AFFILIATION ONLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THINK MANAGER MEMBERS WERE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT.

NO WELL MEDIC WITH THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE IN SUPPORT. EMILY REAP ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS WAIT I KNOW ISSUES COME IN. SAMANTHA GORMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE SEE TERRY DOES NOT OPPOSE EXCLUDING A SMALL REPAID A REBATE EXCUSE ME ON A WATER BILL FROM -- FROM INCOME FOR HOUSEHOLDS HOWEVER WE DO FEEL THAT IS WRITTEN THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR INCLUDING EXEMPTIONS FOR LARGE USERS AND CORPORATIONS FURTHERMORE WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF THE TERM FINANCIAL INCENTIVE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS SO VEGAS TO SUGGEST. ANY NUMBER OF POTENTIAL SUBSIDIES -- AND AS THE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY NOTES THE PREVIOUS GROSS INCOME EXCLUSIONS SPECIFICALLY APPLIED TO REBATES ISSUED FOR PARTICIPATION TURF REMOVAL PROGRAMS WHICH WAS MENTIONED. BUT THIS MEASURE GOES FAR FAR BROADER WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM OR ANY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO EITHER REDUCE OR MANAGE STORM WATER RUNOFF -- THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION ON WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY -- IN ADDITION WERE ENGAGED IN A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION THIS YEAR REGARDING FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY IN THE STATE BUDGET THIS MEASURE WOULD BE OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY EFFORTS ON FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE IS SPREADING. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE HOWEVER. LIKE ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS AND IN FACT THIS IS A DEDUCTION YOU'RE GETTING TO DEDUCT. FROM YOUR DO TAXES WHAT YOU WERE PAID BY THE DISTRICT. IN AFFECTED TO DEDUCTION WHICH AT ANY RATE SOMEBODY EARNING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS GOING TO GET 13% BENEFIT. SOMEBODY EARNING THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND GETS 4% TALK ABOUT MARRIED COUPLES. I JUST WHAT I WOULD RATHER SEE YOU DO IF YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF WORK. IS IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE FRANKLY FOR THE STATE. TO SUBSIDIZE THE DISTRICTS OF THAT THEY COULD GIVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER -- REBATES BUT THEN YOU'D BE GIVING THE SAME REBATE. TO A PERSON WHO MADE YOU MADE A MILLION. THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN HERE YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING THEM A BETTER BREAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO EARN MORE. I WENT OVER AND TURNED TO MISS FUTILITY TO RESPOND I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE BUT I THINK THAT -- WILL HAVE A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE IN MISTER -- MISTER PARK ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AS WELL THESE ARE ACTUALLY EXEMPTIONS THESE ARE NOT CREDITS. SO THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS THAT A HOUSEHOLD WOULD ENROLL IN OUR TURF REPLACE. REBATE -- REPLACEMENT PROGRAM AND THEN UPON SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO US THAN THEY WOULD RECEIVE A REBATE SO THEY ARE REIMBURSED ACTUALLY SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY IT'S LIKE A GRANT -- THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO THEM WHAT HAPPENS IS THEN THEY GET A TEN NINETY NINE A FEDERAL TEN NINETY NINE AND THEN THEY REALIZE THAT THAT AMOUNT THAT WE'VE GRANTED TO THEM AS THE REBATE. IS THEN SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AND THAT'S WHERE THE ISSUE COMES UP SO WE'RE NOT TREATING THEM AS CREDITS. ON THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS -- SO IT'S NOT INCOME PER SE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU ARE GIVING THE BIGGEST BREAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MOST MONEY. THAT'S MY CONCERN. YOU'RE GIVING THEM 13% BACK THEY WOULD ORDINARILY PAY 13% ON SAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY'D BE PAYING THIRTEEN DOLLARS IN TAX. WHERE SOMEBODY WHO MADE SIXTEEN THOUSAND WOULD BE PAYING TWO DOLLARS IN TAX SO YOU'RE GIVING THE BIGGEST BREAK TO THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE MOST MONEY? THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I WOULD RATHER SEE A PROGRAM THAT GIVES THE SAME BREAK TO EVERYBODY AND THERE ARE WAYS TO DESIGN THAT. BUT NOT THIS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING MAKE MORE MONEY. THIS IS A CONCERN I HAVE WITH ALL THE BILLS THAT COME THROUGH HERE. TO BE FAIR HE'S BEING HONEST THIS IS A CONCERN HAS WITH ALL THOSE. I DON'T THINK YES. AND AND BECAUSE HE'S HAD A CONCERN IT'S A VALID CONCERN THAT WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THIS COMMITTEE WHICH IS WHY WE WERE JUST DOING THE LAST BILL THAT WE WE WENT THROUGH -- BECAUSE IT IS A GENUINE CONCERN OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE OPPORTUNITIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOWER INCOME FOLKS ARE ARE ACTUALLY WITH THE ONES GETTING THE BENEFIT THAT WE DON'T HAVE MILLIONAIRES TAKING GREAT ADVANTAGE OF OF SOME OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE. THAT THAT THOSE FUNDS HER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES COMMENTS WHEN AND BEST BE SPENT -- WITH A LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUAL OR IN A SOCIAL SERVICES KIND OF ASPECT. BUT THAT BEING SAID ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MISTER ALL THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- WELL THANK YOU AND I I DO APPRECIATE A DOCTOR QUIRKS A CONCERN -- I THINK THAT IT'S THE EXPECTATION QUITE FRANKLY OF ANY BILL PRESENTED IN A COMMITTEE THAT IF. THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS VIEW -- AMENDMENT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WERE CERTAINLY OPEN TO HEAR AND WHAT THAT MIGHT REPRESENT -- TO WEAR COULD APPLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE I DON'T THINK WE GOT A HEADS UP THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE COULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REVIEW SOMEONE MAY WE HAVE ALLOWED US. TO MAYBE. THE IN ALIGNMENT WITH WITH YOUR THINKING ON THIS BUT I THINK WE HAVE NOTES FROM YOUR OFFICE SAYING THAT YES IN FACT SO YOU HAVE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THAT SO YES. TO DO THAT. SO -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW WITH OUR OFFICE AND HOPEFULLY HAVE A FAVORABLE REVIEW OF OF THE MATTER THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US. MOVING TO FILE ITEM TWELVE A. B. C. -- AWAY WE'RE GONNA DO ADD ONS. TO FILE ITEM ONE AB TWO SIXTY THREE CALL THE ABSENTEES. TO HIGHER SHOES I MULLIN THIS. MELINDA IS NOT LOADING MULLIN.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I HOPE I HAVE A BILL THAT MR QUIRK IS GONNA LIKE. I DO LIKE IT ALL RIGHT THE CITY THERE WERE. ALREADY GONE ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS BILL. RATHER THAN TO GIVING TAX BREAKS TO THE WEALTHY. IS GIVING FOOD TO THE POOR. SB SIX FOURTEEN WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO FRESH FRUITS TO TO FRESH AND HEALTHY FOODS -- FOR IN SECURE FAMILIES BY EXPANDING THE FARM TO FOOD BANK TAX CREDIT. CURRENTLY YOU CAN ONLY DONATE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S ALL LEAVES A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT. PERHAPS GOING TO LANDFILL OR JUST GETTING THROUGH -- THAT CAN GO TO FOOD BANKS THINGS LIKE NOT STEP. SALSA AB ME AEGS DAIRY THERE'S ABOUT WEALTH OF THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT INCLUDED IN WHAT CAN BE DONATED. TO THIS BILL WILL EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF TYPES OF FOOD THAT CAN BE DONATED IT'S A WIN WIN IT PROVIDES ANOTHER MARKET FOR FARMERS WHO OFF OFTENTIMES HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT. THEY ARE ABLE TO USE IT PROVIDES MORE FRESH HEALTHY FOOD FOR OUR LOW INCOME. FAMILIES WHO NEED TOMORROW ACCESS TO FRESH AND HEALTHY FOOD -- AND WE THINK IT'S A GOOD POLICY IN GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE MOST BIPARTISAN BILLS IN THE HOUSE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ANDREW CHASE -- FROM CALIFORNIA AGAINST WASTE CHAIN I GUESS FOR A CAB FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND BONNIE BEEN A WALL FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THE COMMITMENT THE SHEIK INTERCHANGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS I'LL JUST BE VERY BRIEF THAT WE DO HAVE EXTREMELY HIGH RATES OF HUNGER -- TO THEM AND CHILDREN THIS IN THE STATE -- AND OF COURSE HALLWAYS SUPPORT OF PUBLIC NUTRITION PROGRAMS LIKE CAL FRESH -- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT THREATS AGAINST THESE AND EVEN FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE ON CAL FRESH ONE THIRD STILL COME TO FOOD BANKS BECAUSE THE BENEFITS JUST DON'T LAST A MONTH.

THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BY MAIL FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY INVOICE OR STRONG SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY SIX FOURTEEN I LIKE TO THINK IT'S TIME WE MEMBER SUSAN EGGMAN FOR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC. CALIFORNIA DATA SHOWS THAT FOOD WASTE IS MOST PREVALENT ITEM IN OUR LANDFILLS WITH OVER FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF FOOD DUMPED EVERY YEAR. THIS GENERATES A POINT THREE MILLION TONNES OF GREENHOUSE GASES EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESPONSIBLE 420% OF THE STATE'S METHANE EMISSIONS -- AT THE SAME TIME IS ANDREW DISCUSSED -- THERE ARE -- A LARGE PORTION OF OUR POPULATION THAT REMAIN FOOD INTO CARE. I WAS -- SEEN BY THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT GIVE INCENTIVIZING FOOD DONATIONS MOST EFFICIENT AND PRACTICAL WAY TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF FOOD WASTE AT THE SOURCE AND FEED HUNGRY FAMILIES. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A COME SINCE TAX CREDIT MUST BE EXPANDED TO OTHER TYPES OF STAPLE FOODS NEEDED THAT OUR FOOD BANKS. AB SIX FORTY WOULD PROVIDE FARMERS WITH THE COST SAVINGS THAT CAN BE REINVESTED INTO THEIR ASSETS AND COMMUNITIES. AND BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT BY CUTTING THE AMOUNT OF ROTTING FOOD CONTRIBUTING TO METHANE EMISSIONS AND CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ADDITIONAL IS IS IN SUPPORT.

WE WILL AND WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE SUPPORTED YEAH BECAUSE IT'S I MEAN IT DOES SEEM KIND OF SILLY TO NOT ALLOW THESE TYPES OF FOODS TO BE DONATED TO WHEN THEY COULD BE COULD FRANKLY.

ONE TWO ON THE TOOL BELT IS INCENTIVIZING SAVING AND INVESTING IN CALL IN COLLEGE BY PRE FUNDING PLANS.

QUALIFIED FOR IT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN FROM THEIR GROSS INCOME TAX INCOME FOR STATE INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SEE THAT TWICE FOR FAST. UP. WE'LL THE LEGISLATURE WILL TAKE IN ACCOUNT A COUPLE OF POINTS WHEN THEY'RE CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND OTHER FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN BILLS. THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO CONSIDERING WHAT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN TO CHOOSE. THEY ARE. INVESTOR INVESTOR RISK TOLERANCE FEES CHARGED. THE PLANS PAST PERFORMANCE. THE ABILITY THE AVAILABILITY TO THE AVAILABILITY TO WORK WITH A TRUSTED ADVISER. AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR JUST ONE SPOT STATES FOR JUST THE STATE SPONSORED PLAN EFFECTIVELY LIMIT INVESTOR CHOICE BY MAKING THE DRIVING FACTOR. WHERE THE DEDUCTION IS AVAILABLE RATHER THE WHICH FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN BEST SUITS? THE COLLEGE SAVERS OVERALL POSITION.

MADAM CHAIRMEMBERS ASKED ME IN THE CURRENT WITH CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE -- SIMILAR TO OUR OPPOSITION TO AB -- TWO ONE ONE BY MISTER CALDERON I WE DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL -- SPECIFICALLY AND AND THIS IS REFLECTED THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. FOR THAT THERE IS WAS A SURVEY RECENTLY DONE OR A COUPLE YEARS BACK BASICALLY SAYING THAT IS OVERWHELMING 68% OF PEOPLE SURVEYED COULD NOT USE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS. DID NOT USE THEM BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND SO IN KEEPING WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MR QUIRK IS MADE -- THROUGHOUT THE DAY. OUR CONCERN IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY TO SAVE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE WILL BE ABLE. TO GET A TAX BREAK FROM DOING SOMETHING THEY WOULD IN FACT ALREADY DO WHERE AS THOSE WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SAVE OR TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE -- WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS INCENTIVE -- MOREOVER THE COST OF SUCH AN INCENTIVE. WILL REDUCE FUNDING TO STATE PROGRAMS BOTH BY PROP -- NINETY EIGHT FOR K. FOR FOURTEEN BUT FOR OTHER STATE FUNDS FOR US YES YOU AND UC'S AS WELL AND SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THERE WAS A TIME WHEN STATE COLLEGES WERE ACTUALLY FREE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND AS THOSE TUITIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE -- WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND WHAT ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO DO IS ACTUALLY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE OLDER TAX CREDITS EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR YEARS AND ARE DRAINING THE STATE BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? AS A MEANS TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR PARK -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY -- BUT LET ME SKIP THAT PART WE HAVE A BILL. WE HAVE A BILL THAT'S BEEN SUBMITTED A. B. FIFTEEN BY IN THIS AREA MCCARTY AND TANG. AND WHAT IT DOES IS GIVES ANYONE WHO WILL SET UP AN ACCOUNT OF THIS TYPE FOR KIDS WHO ARE BORN IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER DETAILS AND GIVE EVERYONE -- THE SAME AMOUNT -- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR VARIOUS WAYS TO FUND THESE ACCOUNTS. THE OTHER THING WE COULD DO IS JUST READ THE EIGHT REDUCE TUITION. AT CSU AND AND USE BETTER APPROACHES THEM -- REWARDING PEOPLE WITH THE MOST MONEY GETTING THE BIGGEST BREAK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS -- MISTER BROWN THEY SOUND CHAIR DR CHOI THANKS FOR BRINGING US FOR WE TRIED THIS A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT. WAS HELD IN COMMITTEE -- MISTER CALDERON SCOTT IT SO HOPEFULLY YOU GUYS CAN GET TOGETHER AND HAVE THIS BE A BI PARTISAN VEHICLE -- I'D LOOK AT MYSELF FOR MY KIDS BUT THERE'S NO REAL INCENTIVE -- TO DO IT AND AS WE LEARN FROM THE TREASURE LAST WEEK -- SHE SAID CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO OTHER STATES THAT OFFER INCENTIVES AND PUT THEIR MONEY IN FIVE TWENTY NINES OTHER STATES. SO -- WE CAN KEEP THAT MONEY HERE I DO AGREE MISTER QUIRK WE GOT A LOWER THE TUITION THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. AND UP WE ALSO LEARNED LAST WEEK THERE'S OTHER WAYS YOU CAN GET STUDENTS IN COLLEGE. TO WHERE ALTERNATE STANDARD JAIL YEAR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THE COMMITTEE. SEEN AND ORDER TO I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THIS IS SIDE EXACTLY THE RE SON -- THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO INCENTIVIZE THE PEOPLE OR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INVESTMENT OUT OF CHILDREN'S OF FUTURE OHIO EDUCATION. COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- THE WORSE UP BILL INTRODUCED A TO EXCUSE ORDERS CHILDREN THAT'S THAT'S UP AGAIN A MEASURE PEOPLE WERE.

WITHOUT IT SHOULD BE LOWERED IN FACT ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN RAISED SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY IN ADDITION AND AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THAT INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO PAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO OPEN A BUSINESS AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR SO THERE ARE MEANS TO AVOID THIS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR. MINIMUM FEE -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT SIMILAR ISSUES INTRODUCED SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN NONE HAVE PASSED THEIR HOUSE OF ORIGIN WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT IS -- REFLECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S OPINION ON THE SUBJECT BUT REGARDLESS ARE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

FOR SIXTEEN THE BILL THAT WILL PROVIDE A STATE TAX DEDUCTION TO INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO CAL ABLE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHICH ACCOUNTS THAT BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONGRESS PASSED THE ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE ACT WHICH ENABLES INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. TO OPEN TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THESE ACCOUNT ASIAN. A MEDICAL CARE AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO LIVING WITH A DISABILITY. EACH STATE OPERATES THEIR OWN ABLE PROGRAMS AND MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALREADY OPENED ACCOUNTS IN OTHER STATES. AS A STATE WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER EVERY TOOL FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS BILL WILL HELP PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE ACCOUNTS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN GIVING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES A CHANCE AT INDEPENDENCE. IMPORTANTLY ABLE COUNTS DO NOT COUNT AGAINST A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES AGAINST A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY ELIGIBILITY FOR SSI. I MEDICAID AND OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS. THIS RECOGNIZES THE CHALLENGES OF LIVING WITH A DISABILITY AND THE AMOUNT OF CARE AND MONEY THAT IS NEEDED THE SITUATION. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT IN CLEAN TREASURER FIANNA Mà FORMER CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER JOHN JOHN IN FIFTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THE DISABILITY ABBASI COMMUNITY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY SUPPORT IS THE MOTHER OF THE FIRST CAL ABLE ACCOUNT OWNER. KELLY CALLS ARRAY AS ALLEGED ALICE REVIEW TREASURE IF YOU'RE A MOP LIKE JOHNSON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN FONG FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU -- EVERYONE HEARS WHO'S HERE TODAY -- OUT. TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT MY SUPPORT FOR A BI FOR SIXTEEN THE CAL ABLE TAX DEDUCTION BILL. THERE ARE MANY HIDDEN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING A CHILD WITH A DISABILITY. AND THAT'S PART OF MY LIFE. MANY FAMILIES HAVE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS FOR EARLY INTERVENTIONS LIKE SPEECH PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. EVEN IF YOU HAVE AMAZING HABILITATED OF THERAPY COVERAGE INSURANCE TYPICALLY COVERS. ONLY IN CLINIC THERAPIES FOR A FAMILY LIKE MINE. THIS MEN'S DRIVING NINETY MILES EACH WAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK AS OUR INSURANCE DID NOT ALLOW FOR BILLING MORE THAN ONE THERAPY EACH DAY. A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES PER DAY. NINE HUNDRED MILES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF OUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT FAMILIES ARE FACING EVERYDAY FAMILIES LIKE OURS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF FINANCIAL STRESS. THIS TAX DEDUCTION THE COW ABLE TAX DEDUCTION WILL BE A WONDERFUL INCENTIVE TO SAVE WHILE REDUCING THE STRESS WE EXPERIENCE EACH DAY. TEN STATES HAVE ABLE STATE TAX DEDUCTIONS RIGHT NOW. AND THEY HAVE MORE ACCOUNTS AND MORE ASSETS THAN THE STATE'S WITHOUT THEM. STATE TAX DEDUCTIONS ENCOURAGE SAVING. PENNSYLVANIA HAS A STATE TAX DEDUCTION FOR THE ENTIRE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. AND PENNSYLVANIANS HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AVERAGE ACCOUNT SIZES IN THE NATION. CAL ABLE OPENED ON DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH. AND WE'VE SEEN A HUGE GROWTH AND INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH TENTH CAL ABLE HAD EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN ACCOUNTS AND TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND THIS NUMBER GROWS EACH WEEK. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS THE HIDDEN COSTS OF DISABILITY LOWER ANTICIPATED EARNING POTENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIKE MY DAUGHTER. AND ALL THE OTHER INEQUALITIES THAT OUR DAUGHTER FACES THIS TAX DEDUCTION IS A FIRST STEP. TOWARDS PARITY FOR CAL ABLE ACCOUNT OWNERS. TODAY OUR DAUGHTERAMELIA IS A BRIGHT AND SASSY SIX AND A HALF YEAR OLD GIRL. SHE'S SUCCESSFULLY INCLUDED IN HER SCHOOL AND SHE IS THRIVING WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SAVE MORE MONEY FOR HER POST SECONDARY OPTIONS FOR FUTURE HOUSING AND HER FUTURE LIFE. BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE WILL EXCEED OUR HOPES AND OUR DREAMS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS. WE SIMPLY CAN'T DO THIS WITH OUR CURRENT EARNING POTENTIAL. IF WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMAN FONG'S TAX A CALIBER BILL TAX DEDUCTION BILL SIGNED INTO LAW WE AND THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES LIKE OURS. WE'LL BE ABLE TO ENVISION A FUTURE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF POVERTY.

BUT HERE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVE THE HIGHEST INCOME IN THERE FOR WILL GET THE BIGGEST TAX BREAK. I WOULD RATHER A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY GAVE MONEY TO PEOPLE COULDN'T EVEN START A FIVE TWENTY NINE AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE JUST A BETTER WAY TO USE THE STATE'S MONEY SO AGAIN.

FILE ITEM NUMBER. FOUR TWO FIFTY ONE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME -- TO PRESENT AB TWO FIFTY ONE THIS WOULD PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT. TO FAMILY CARE GIVERS UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES INCURRED WHILE TAKING CARE OF LOVED ONES. WITH CALIFORNIA'S SURGING POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP WAYS TO ADDRESS THE VAST NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ACCOMPANY THIS -- DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT. MEMBERS OF THIS POPULATION ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS HAVE A SICK SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT THROUGH CARE GIVERS AND COMMONLY. SUCH CARE GIVERS ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. YET RECEIVE NO COMPENSATION FOR THEIR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES SUCH AS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. MEDICINE HALLMARK. PATIENTS FOR EXCESS ABILITY AND THE LIKE. AB TWO FIFTY ONE WILL HELP TO RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CARING FOR LOVED ONES IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA PREPARE. FOR RAPIDLY INCREASING POPULATIONS OF OLDER ADULTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS MANY OF WHICH WILL NEED A FULL TIME CAREGIVER. THIS IS A TAX CREDIT SPECIFICALLY AIMS TO BENEFIT THE MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO OFTEN RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO OUTSIDE HELP. WITH -- WHILE TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY MEMBER FULL TIME. CALIFORNIA ONCE HAD A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR FAMILY CARE GIVERS. THAT CREDIT SUNSET IN. TWO THOUSAND GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME TO BRING IT BACK AND INCREASE THE CAP TO A MORE IMPACTFUL AND MEANINGFUL AMOUNT. THE MEDIAN ANNUAL COST OF NURSING HOME CARE IS A STAGGERING ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. IF WE INVEST A LITTLE BIT IN HELPING FAMILY MEMBERS CARE FOR LOVED ONES THIS WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. BUT TODAY I HAVE WITH ME AT DAVID FEINBERG CAPITAL RESPONSE TEAM VOLUNTEER AND DISTRICT LIAISON VOLUNTEER WITH A A RP. AND MICHELLE TO BEAUTY -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE VALLEY CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER IN FRESNO TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU IN ASSISTANCE.

STAFF STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIFTY ONE TO PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE PROVIDING CARE AND SERVICES TO THEIR LOVED ONES. FAMILY CARE GIVING WHAT. RUMORS LIKE ME. HAVE NO CHOICE WE LOVE. OUR LOVED ONES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SURVIVE. MY STORY IS THAT OF A MOTHER WHO IS NINETY FOUR YEARS OLD LIVING IN A MEMORY FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE COST FOR CARE GOES BETWEEN NINE AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH DEPENDING ON YOUR SPECIFIC MEDICAL NEEDS. OF THAT HER INCOME OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH RECEIVES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY IN A VETERAN'S PENSION. DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO COVER THAT COST AN ADDITIONAL THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS PAID BY HOSPICE AGAIN THAT HELPS MASSIVELY IN PROVIDING HER CARE BUT THE REMAINING FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH PASSED TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. AND SHE HAS NO OTHER ASSETS THAT FALL THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I SPEND MONTHLY WHICH I LOVE TO DO IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF MY OWN RETIREMENT PLAN SO THAT WHEN MY WIFE AND I REACH THAT AGE AND NEED THE CARE. THE FUNDS THAT WE PUT AWAY WILL BE THERE. A A RP RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CARE GIVERS ON AVERAGE SPEND. NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF POCKET FOR EXPENSES FOR THEIR LOVED ONES A A RP IS ALSO FOUND THAT THOSE CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA CAN SPEND NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. OVERALL CAL A. R. P. ESTIMATES THAT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIANS NEARLY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CARETAKERS EQUAL FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ANY ADDITIONAL HELP CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THE FAMILY CARE TAKERS LIKE MYSELF WOULD HELP TO OFFSET THE LOSS TO OUR OWN RETIREMENT INCOME AND SAVINGS. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE THE BOOTY ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR VALLEY CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER AND FRESNO CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ONE OF THE ELEVEN CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA SERVING OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND CLIENTS IN NINE COUNTIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM STANISLAUS TO KERN. VALLEY CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER NONPROFIT AS ONE THE FEW ORGANIZATIONS RECOGNIZING THE PLIGHT OF FAMILY CARE. IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO HELP THEM THRIVE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY AND SPEAK WITH YOU. IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR MOTHER WHO HAS DEMENTIA THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. AND A CAN OF FOR THE SEVEN TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR FACILITY OR IN HOME CARE HOW WOULD WE RESPOND. MY FAMILY PERSONALLY HAD TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS MY PARENTS SAVE THEIR WHOLE LIVES MY DAD HAD A LONG TERM CARE PLAN MOM UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T QUALIFY. MOM HAD DEMENTIA MOVED IN WITH MY SISTER IT HAVE ADDITIONAL HELP IN OUR HOME HOWEVER DAD HOW TO SELL EVERYTHING HE HAD INCLUDING THEIR HOME AND LIVE VERY MODESTLY IN ORDER TO HELP PAY FOR MOMS CARE. THE WHOLE FAMILY DID HELP MY SISTER HUSBAND DID ASK FOR ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM BAD BECAUSE JUST WASN'T ANY TO BE HAD. MY FAMILY SITUATION IS FAR FROM UNIQUE IN FACT MEMORY FOR MANY FAMILIES FIND IT MUCH HARDER BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING AT IT ALONE OR DON'T HAVE AS MANY RESOURCES. IF YOU'VE EVER TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY MEMBER OR SPOUSE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE GROWING ISSUES THAT PLAGUE OUR SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILY CARE GIVERS. AND AS A COMMUNITY WE CAN NO LONGER IGNORE THIS -- POPULATION IN EXACTLY WHO ARE THESE CARE GIVERS THERE'S AN ESTIMATED FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVER ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. PROVIDING EQUIVALENTLY ESTA ES ESTIMATED FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN CARE FOR LONG TERM SERVICES. THE OLDER CARE GIVERS HAVE A 63% HIGHER MORTALITY RATE THAN ON CARE GIVERS AND I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THIS EVERY DAY IN MY JOB. ONE IN FOUR CARE GIVERS ARE MILLENNIALS FOR TRYING TO JUGGLE SCHOOL AND WORK. WITHOUT RESOURCES SUPPORT MANY FAMILY CAREGIVERS FIND THEMSELVES IN A STATE OF CRISIS. VULNERABLE TO DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND EVEN SUICIDE. IS MY PERSONAL PROFESSIONAL BELIEVE THAT AB. TWO FIFTY ONE IS THE BEGINNING OF RECOGNIZING ASSISTING THE FINE. IT WOULD NOT ONLY BENEFIT THE CARE GIVER FINANCIALLY BUT ALSO IMPACT THEIR WELL BEING THANK YOU SO MUCH. ADDITIONAL ESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON BREAK NEBRASKA WE HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MET THE CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I'M WE DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PROBLEM THE AUTHORS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS IN THIS -- CERTAINLY THE BURDEN OF FAMILIES ON FAMILIES OF ADULT CARE CAN BE QUITE COSTLY I'M WE DO DISAGREE THAT THE PROBLEM CAN AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH TAX CREDITS. PARTICULARLY WITH THE COSTS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS IDENTIFIED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD A SUCH A POLICY WOULD SORELY DEPLETE THE GENERAL FUND KEEPER FOURTEEN EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ON WHICH AGENCY AGING POPULATIONS THIS BILL SEEKS TO ASSIST -- DO RELY ONCE AGAIN THIS IS ALSO A MEASURE THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO REWARD THOSE WHO CAN IN FACT ALREADY AFFORD -- TO SUPPLY THESE TYPES OF SERVICES -- TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT THE FAMILY CAREGIVER MUST HAVE ADJUSTED INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS AN INDIVIDUAL FILER OR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AS A JOINT FILERS -- IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE THE MEASURE DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT FOR WEALTH SO EVEN THOUGH IT DOES HAVE A CAP WHICH IS QUITE HIGH ON IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE PERHAPS AS PEOPLE ARE NEARING RETIREMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY ARE. OF SIGNIFICANT MEANS ON SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY BUT MIGHT HAVE A A REDUCED INCOME -- THEY WOULD STILL OF COURSE BE ELIGIBLE WITH UNFORTUNATELY THOSE AT THE LOWEST END OF THE INCOME SPECTRUM UNLIKELY TO SEEK ANY SEE ANY BENEFIT -- PARTICULARLY THOSE OF COURSE WHO DON'T ITEMIZE -- THE LA -- ALSO REVIEWED INFORMATION FROM THE PREVIOUS -- CREDIT THAT THAT -- LAPSED AND SUNSET IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND FOUND THAT CREDITS OF ALMOST TWO POINT FOUR MILLION WERE CLAIMED IN THE TWO THOUSAND THREE TAX YEAR BUT OF THOSE. A 75% OF THE CLAIMANTS ACTUALLY REPORTED AGI AN EXACT IN EXCESS OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WAS VERY VERY FEW -- AT LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED TAXPAYERS WHO ACTUALLY HAD A GROSS INCOME OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR LESS -- AND THE KELLY -- CONCLUDED AT THAT TIME WHAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE TRUE OF THIS MEASURE THAT THE CREDIT OPERATED AS MORE OF A REWARD FOR THE CARE PROVIDER RATHER THAN TO INCENTIVIZE. OR ENTERS OTHERS TO PROVIDE CARE. FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE THINKING. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM ME DOT COM I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A GENUINE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS ARM TO LIMIT THIS -- TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE CARE AND IN THAT SENSE I THINK IT'S YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. I WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS TIME GOES ON BUT I THANK YOU FOR THINKING ABOUT THIS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME COMMENTS. THERE MADE ME ANALYSIS SHE'S PROBABLY PAID BILL GOES ON THAT I I THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS EFFORT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THE COMMITTEE.

JUST A ARE APPRECIATED THE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT -- TO THERE ARE A LOT LOWER INCOME FOLKS AND ALL -- BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT -- ANYONE REGARDLESS OF INCOME -- CAN. APPLY AND QUALIFY FOR THIS -- THE OTHER REASON THAT WE SET IT AT THE NUMBER THAT WE DID. WAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH FOLKS. DISCOVERED THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR -- IT IS SORT OF THE THE TYPICAL KIND OF OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE. AND AGAIN THIS IS. FOR THE KINDS OF PURCHASE IS NECESSARY TO DO THE WORK -- OF CARING FOR THEM AS WELL -- OBVIOUSLY. MODIFYING HOMES PUTTING STARED. STARES IN -- TO GET AROUND STARES DEAD.

IT MUST MEET TO QUALIFICATIONS IT MUST BE OUT OF THE STATE MORE THAN 51% OF THE TIME. AND THE VEHICLE MUST MAKE ITS INITIAL TRIP WITH A LOAD. INTO THE STATE. EVEN IF IT WAS PURCHASED IN CAL SO MANDATING THIS INBOUND TRIP REQUIREMENT OBVIOUSLY INCREASES POLLUTION THERE'S WEAR AND TEAR ON ROADS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS DISCOURAGES BUYERS FROM PURCHASING THEIR COMMERCIAL TRUCKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY COMMERCIAL TRAILERS USED IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE DO NOT NEED TO MEET THIS INBOUND TRIP REQUIREMENT. AND INSTEAD MUST CONFORM TO PLAY TO THE TRAILER IS USED IN COMMERCE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN 51% OF THE TIME AND THAT THE TRAILER WILL LEAVE THE STATE WITHIN SEVENTY FIVE DAYS WITH ITS FIRST LOAD. AB THREE TWENTY ONE SIMPLY SEEKS TO APPLY THE SAME REQUIREMENTS TO COMMERCIAL TRUCKS USED IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. OF TO HELP EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR A BI THREE TWENTY ONE AND TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT HERE IS LEE HOWARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKS ENTERS [inaudible] HI -- I'M WE HOWARD I REPRESENT -- ONE THE LARGEST -- TRUCK DEALERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA -- EACH DO H. HERE WE DELIVER AND SELL PROBABLY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TRUCKS OUT OF MY FIVE DEALERSHIP LOCATIONS THAT -- ARE GOING TO INTERSTATE COMMERCE -- THE FIRST LOAD IS THE REQUIRED. OUTSIDE TRUCK BROUGHT INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THESE TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS TO BUY USED TRUCKS EVERY YEAR ALSO TYPICALLY BY A TRAILER -- THAT CAN PICK IT UP AT THE DEALERSHIP. MEANWHILE WE HAVE TO DELIVER THE TRUCK OUT OF STATE IN A NEVADA ARIZONA -- ORGAN -- AND THEN THEY HAVE TO AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S WHEN THE LEADING -- AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES AND SO WE EXPORT A LOT OF PRODUCTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA BUT THIS THEY HAVE TO BRING A LOAD IN THE CALIFORNIA QUALIFY FIRST -- WE PRESENT WE SELL THE TRUCK TO THE CUSTOMER IN CALIFORNIA AT OUR DEALERSHIP AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE STRUCTURE WE HAVE TO THEN. HAVE THEM TRAVEL UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH BURNS ABOUT A FIFTY GALLONS OF ADDITIONAL FUEL -- BEFORE THAT IT WITH AN EMPTY TRAILER THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAUL ANYTHING -- WE THEN GO TO RISE THE SALE TOOK PLACE IN THE STATE OF NEVADA TRANSFER THE TRUCK BACK INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE TO PAY A DRIVER TO GO OUT BOUND AND COME BACK. THEY COME BACK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONLY TO TAKE THEIR LOAD BACK OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET PARITY SO THAT WHEN THEY PURCHASED THE TRACK AND THE TRAILER WITH THE PROCESS AND DO THE SAME THING -- TWO THOUSAND TRUCKS THAT WE SELL IN A YEAR -- IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF DIESEL BOXES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF DIESEL BURNING CHIU EACH YEAR.

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CHAIR MEMBERS MEET THE CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION I THINK OF ALL OF THE BILLS THAT WE OPPOSE IN THIS COMMITTEE THIS ONE MIGHT MAKE ME THE MOST UNPOPULAR OF ALL OF THEM -- BUT THAT SAID LET'S TALK IT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT. WINDS IN CALIFORNIA'S TAX CODE ARE ARE FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN ARBITRARILY DOT DRAWN EVEN IN INSTANCES OF SO CALLED NECESSITY AND I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES. FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T TAX FOOD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THAT ALSO INCLUDES CANDY WHICH ARGUABLY NOT A NECESSITY WE DO HOWEVER TAX TOILET PAPERS. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE DON'T TAX PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION IF THE DOCTOR HAS PRESCRIBED IT BUT THE SAME MEDICATION IF PURCHASED OVER THE COUNTER WE WOULD IN FACT TAX -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN CALIFORNIA'S TAX CODE. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST MEASURE THAT WE AND THAT WAS ON THE BASIS OF GENDER SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY BUT THEN IT ALSO BEGS A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR EXEMPTIONS THAT FOLLOW FOR EXAMPLE COSMETICS CLOTHING CLOTHING ARGUABLY BRAS ARE SOMETHING THAT WOMEN DO IN FACT NEED -- BUT THEY ARE TAXED. AND THEN -- OTHER OVER THE COUNTER -- PHARMACEUTICALS -- THINGS LIKE CONTRACEPTIVES CONDOMS OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL ARGUABLY SHOULD THESE BE TAXED -- IN ADDITION TO THAT. LET'S WALK THROUGH. THE SAVINGS I'M SO WAIT A FIFTY CAL BOX OF TAMPONS ASSUMING IT'S A REGULAR SIZE TAMPON TAMPAX PEARL TODAY WOULD COST NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY NINE CENTS AT TARGET. AIMING A 6% STATE SALES TAX THIS MEASURE IF PASSED WOULD SAVE REGARDLESS OF NEED FIFTY SIX CENTS. PER BOX ASSUME ONE BOX PER MONTH IT WOULD SAVE UNDER SEVEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR YOUR PROBABLY AVERAGE CONSUMER SO IN ESSENCE NOT ENOUGH TO BUY ANOTHER BOX OF TAMPONS -- HOWEVER THE COST TO THE STATE OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH A MEASURE WOULD BE ABOUT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EIGHT MILLION OF WHICH ANNUALLY WOULD BE A DIRECT HIT TO PUBLIC EDUCATION -- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN OBVIOUSLY IS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME HER A. B. TEN ON TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I THINK IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW. YOU CAN. REDUCE THE BURDEN ON CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF WOMEN -- THAT MEASURE -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH IT ACTUALLY THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS CERTAIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT MET VARIOUS POVERTY THRESHOLDS HAD FUNDING TO SUPPLY THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS TO STUDENTS IN NEED -- AND SO WE ARE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS MEASURE WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD BUT WOULD ENCOURAGE HER -- TO CONTINUE TO CONSIDER OPTIONS SIMILAR TO AB TEN WHERE THOSE MOST IN NEED -- CAN NOT ONLY GET A BENEFIT BUT A BENEFIT THAT WOULD REALLY BE MEANINGFUL -- RATHER THAN ONE THAT WOULD SAVE WOMEN ACROSS THE STATE THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVEN DOLLARS A YEAR THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL ESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND THE COMMITTEE. ANYBODY. SO I HAVE A QUESTION -- BASICALLY I GUESS YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND MY PREDECESSOR FOR SMALL AS A MAN -- AND DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. I DO HAVE A QUESTION AS A WOMAN CHAIR. CLEARLY SIXTY CENTS OR WHATEVER YOU CALCULATED WE GET SOME PEOPLE GET TO SIXTY CENTS SOME PEOPLE GET TO EIGHTY CENTS SAVINGS A MONTH. NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE. NOT ENOUGH TO BUY AN EXTRA BOX OF THE YEAR OR NOT ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY TO CHANGE WHETHER YOU CAN WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT PURCHASE. SO FOR YOU IS THIS A IS THIS. GENDER EQUITY ISSUE OR IS THIS A FINANCIAL ISSUE. BOTH -- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE DECIDING IF EIGHTY SENSITIVE ENOUGH OR NOT I HAVE FOLKS OUT THERE WAS JUST. ACTUALLY HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH. SOMEBODY ABOUT HOW WHEN I WAS SICK MY SISTER NICE TO PULL OUR MONEY TOGETHER TO BUY WHEN THOSE LITTLE TINY BAGS OF CHIPS AND WITH A QUARTER -- AND SO. PICK UP PENNIES WHATEVER I WAS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS KNACK INSTILLED THAT TWENTY FIVE CENTS AND LIKE THE WORLD TO AS IT ALSO MEANT THAT MAYBE I GOT TWO OF THE PULL THAT DAY YOU KNOW AND SO. I THINK IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON A LIMITED BUDGET FOR THEM THAT EIGHTY SINCE MY MEAN A LOT AND EIGHTY CENTS. A DOLLAR I MEAN IT VARIES BY EIGHT BY HELPFUL INDIVIDUALS. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE DRAWING THE LINE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF I WOULD USE THAT SAME LOT LOGIC TO SAY THAN THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE USE IS THE PORTABLE. BUT THIS IS ABOUT ON THE LINE I WANNA I WANNA TALK THAT THE OPPOSITION THEY TALKED ABOUT. DRAWING THE LINE IN IN A GENDER SPECIFIC THIS IS THE ONLY GENDER SPECIFIC ITEM IN OUR TAX CODE. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT SAYS THAT MY UTERUS ON BORN WITH THE UTERUS AND AYE MAINSTREET EVERY MONTH FOR FORTY YEARS OF MY LIFE. IS A LUXURY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AND I THOUGHT SELECT THAT AND WE TALKED ABOUT COSMETICS AND CLOTHING NOT ESSENTIALS. PLACENTALS IKE ADVOCATE DISS HAS BEEN DOING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY AND NOW HE SOUTH LOOKS LET'S TAKE A MONTH FOR THE NEXT MONTH EVERYONE THE MINISTRY SO THAT WHICH OPERATING GO AHEAD AND HAVE THAT BLOOD. STAIN EVERYWHERE ON AND YOU KNOW LET'S ALSO NOT SHAVER LIFT UP AND MAKE UP THE EFFECTS ARE NOT THE SAME THE REALITY IS NOT THE SAME OUT THERE WE SHOULD HAVE A GENERAL INTEREST TAX CODE AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT SAVINGS FOR THOSE FOLKS AND THEY COULD DIEM HOW TO BEST. USE WHETHER IT'S A QUARTER OR TWO DOLLARS YEP LOOKS AT THE TIME BUT THEY'RE BUYING INDIVIDUAL TAMPONS OUR PRODUCT OF THE TIMES THAT'S ALL THEY COULD AFFORD THAT AND THEY HAVE TO STRETCH OUT I TO MAKE IT WORK. AND CITING COMING FROM A POSITION OF PRIVILEGE AND SAYING EIGHTY CENTS IS NOT A LOT IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE FOR ME NOT TO GET RID OF THIS TAX. NOT YET IN A DEBATE ON THE CONVERSATION BUT I MEAN. WE DO WORK IN PA I WILL WORK AND POVERTY REGULARLY AND IT'S NOT A COMMENTED AS TOO LATE WHETHER SIXTY OR FORTY OR FIFTY CENTS OR EIGHTY CENTS IS ENOUGH. THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. IS THAT FOR A YOU OR ME OR OR AB MIDDLE CLASS INDIVIDUAL ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND ARE WE BEING TARGETED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION. I AND THAT'S WHY MY QUESTION IS VERY GENUINELY. IS IS THIS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT. THAT IS TAX THAT IS A WOMAN ONLY PRODUCT OR IS THIS ABOUT THE TWENTY FOUR IN TO EIGHTY CENTS -- BECAUSE FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION AND YOU KNOW I I IT IS THAT THAT SIXTY CENTS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING THAT EIGHTY CENTS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO BY INDIVIDUAL TAMPONS ARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD AT THAT MOMENT. HOWEVER I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION DIFFICULTY WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS THAT IT DOESN'T IT ISN'T JUST FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IT'S FOR EVERYBODY. AND IS NOT JUST A CHAIR BUT AS A WOMAN CHAIR I CAN UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT ONLY WOMEN USE AND THAT IT IS NOT SHOCKING TO ME ON ANY LEVEL. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONE PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE TAXED AND WE'RE OTHERS WOULDN'T BUT I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR INTENTION WAS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT. CLEARLY BOTH I HAVE A HASHTAG GENDER EQUITY AS IT IS ABOUT GENDER EQUITY AND THE TAX CODE -- AND SO I WOULD LIKE A TAX CODE THAT. REFLECTS THE VALUES THAT. NO MATTER IF I'M LOW INCOME MIDDLE INCOME OR HIGH INCOME MY UTERUS IS NOT A LUXURY. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT A LUXURY THERE'S NOT A HAPPY HOUR I WOULD LOVE TO TAX CANDY AND SNACKS I'VE TRIED IT MULTIPLE TIMES THAT WOULD LOVE TO TAX. COCKTAILS -- BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE GET THE POLITICAL WILL OF HOW WE REFORM ARE GROW THE TAX BASE. I WOULD LIKE. FIRST AND FOREMOST IMMEDIATELY PRESS TO HAVE A GENERAL NEUTRAL TAX CODE IT'S ABOUT THE MESSAGES VERY SENDING ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND WOMEN'S BIOLOGY ASAL HOLE A RESPECTIVE OF OUR INCOME. THANK IN PEACE IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ME AND SO FROM IS ABOUT TO SEE ONE OR THE OTHER AND I HAVEN'T BEEN SHY ABOUT TALKING ABOUT GENDER EQUITY. AROUND THIS ISSUE AND THE AND COMMISSION ALSO COMES INTO PLAY BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO BREAK IT DOWN TO ONE I THINK EITHER MERITS A YES VOTE WHEN THIS IS UP FOR A VOTE -- HOWEVER YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT. DR COURT DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR INTENT. SUPPOSE WE WERE TO JUST TAX MORE MALE PRODUCTS IN THAT WOULD EVEN IT OUT. I WOULD LIKE I I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO TO THAT BECAUSE I NEED IF I AM FOR GENDER EQUITY HAVE BOTH SIDES -- AND SO I I YOU KNOW WELL I THINK THAT THAT INNOVATIVE. IN ALL FAIRNESS I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO ME TO SAY SUDDENLY IN THE SAME WAY THAT I'M ASKING THAT WE DON'T SINGLE OUT. THE THE THE PEOPLE VIOLENT THE UTERUS I DON'T WANT TO SINGLE OUT. SOMEONE WORKING WITH THE ****. WITH THAT AND IT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE I THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY AND THE IN THIS PART OF THE DISCUSSION ARE ON MINSTREL EQUITY IS JUST A SMALL PART IN IN THE DISCUSSION OF HOW WE SEE WOMEN HOW WE SEE OUR BIOLOGY OUT THERE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BUT WHEN IT'S TIME AND I THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ENGAGING IN THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THE TOPICS NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR PERIODS AND I ALWAYS LEAVE YOU WITH THIS IT'S IT'S NOT A? BLUE PRODUCT AND WE'RE NOT RUNNING TO FEELS EVERYMONTH WHEN WE GET OUR PERIOD OUT THERE -- AND SO THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE WE LIVE IN AN PART OF GETTING RID OF THE NATURAL -- TABOO THAT IS OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT IT OPENLY FIRE SEXUALLY -- AND THANKFULLY US I'M SORRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BUT WHEN IT'S TIME AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE SPACE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION WELL ABSOLUTELY LESSEN THE DISCOMFORT IT'S GIVEN MY COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN JOY ENOUGH FOR ME [inaudible] THANK YOU. MOVING TO FILE ITEM. NINE AB. FOUR NINETY TWO ROSE MARIE REALLY INTO AND THAT SHE THE LAUGHING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING AB FOR NINETY TWO MY OFFICE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO COMPLY. WITH THE COMMITTEES TAX EXPENDITURE POLICY -- A BEFORE NINETY TWO WILL EXPAND TO HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS PROPERTY TAX ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF AGE OR DISABILITY. THE HOMEOWNER AND RENTERS SYSTEMS PRO LOW INCOME SENIORS AND DISABLED HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS IT PROVIDES A PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT OF PROPERTY TAXES PAID. FOR THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS. FOR RENTERS THIS BILL SIXTY SEEKS TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM TO ALL LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN FACING A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND IS DRIVING MORE CALIFORNIANS INTO POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. MORE THAN HALF OF RENTER HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR STATE PAY MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOMES TOWARD HOUSING. MAKING THEM HOUSING COSTS BURDENED AND NEARLY A THIRD ARE SEVERELY COST BURDENED PAYING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOMES TOWARD HOUSING. THESE FOLKS ARE ALREADY MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO PAY RENT OR BUY GROCERIES. AND THESE YEARLY REIMBURSEMENTS WILL HELP TO SUBSIDIZE A PART OF THEIR FINANCES. BY FIVE BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN TAKE ANOTHER CRITICAL STEP TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE CURRENT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. AND WITH ME TODAY IS SUSIE SHANNON WITH POVERTY MATTERS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I'M CZ SHANNON I AM A HEALTH COMMISSIONER WITH CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF POVERTY MATTERS. AND MY ORGANIZATION PROVIDES DIRECT SERVICES AND POLICY ADVOCACY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS -- AS WELL AS LOW INCOME RENTERS CLIENTS. HAVE INCOMES BELOW THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND WE ARE VERY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF AB -- FOUR NINETY TWO WHICH PROVIDES ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS -- REGARDLESS OF DISABILITY OR AGE -- AS YOU HEARD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATE WHERE ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS -- I SEE THIS EVERY DAY AND LOS ANGELES IS ARGUABLY THE HOMELESS CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES AND SHARES THAT. A TITLE -- WITH NEW YORK -- AND I WORK WITH LOW INCOME RENTERS WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS -- AND WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE RENT BIRD AND WHAT WE DON'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT ARE THE STORIES. OF FROM LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO BUY FOOD -- TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON TO PURGE AIDS -- SOCKS AND SHOES AND GETTING JUST BASIC TRANSPORTATION TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND SOMETIMES JUST THAT LITTLE BIT -- CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GETTING INTO A DOCTOR AND NOT GETTING TO A DOCTOR -- SO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THIS POPULATION COMMUNE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND GOING HUNGRY AND IF SOMETIMES PARAMOUNT TO THE HEALTH AND WELFARE -- FOR THOSE WHOSE INCOMES ARE AT OR BELOW THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THEN ONE OTHER THING THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN JUST OVER THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA -- HAD EARNINGS AT OR BELOW THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE IN THIS INCOME BRACKET -- INCREASES CONSUMER BUYING POWER POWER FOR ESSENTIAL ITEMS AND THAT MONEY GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY CAN ALSO ACT AS AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS. SO IF YOU'RE NOT MOTIVATED BY THE HUMANITARIAN ARGUMENT -- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER ON THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT AND WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL SUPPORT AB FOUR NINETY TWO THANK YOU. FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. JIM HAMMER WITH HOW. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TIM CAMERA CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC ADVISERS ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS OF SOUTHERN CITIES AN APARTMENT SO SEASONS OF ORANGE COUNTY WE SUPPORT AND WE JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS AND REMINDING US AS WE DEAL WITH THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY POLICIES THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE LAW. THEY JUST NEED A BIT MORE FUNDING. THANK YOU. WHEN THIS IS OUR YOUTH SUPPORTER OF WE'RE ADD TWEENER AT THIS TIME WE'RE STILL CONTEMPLATING OUR POSITION I'M WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD? IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT WE COULD GET TO SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE HOWEVER WE DO NEED TO HAVE A FEW MORE CONVERSATIONS AND DO SOME SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS TO JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND FOR YOUR OFFICE FOR REACHING OUT -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE YES START QUIRK -- SO MY MY REAL QUESTION ON THIS YEAR'S PARTICULARLY IN THE AMOUNT FOR A HOMEOWNER. CAN THIS REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PERHAPS YOUR EXPERT OR YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY. OUT OF GIVE A BRIEF ANSWER BUT I'D LIKE -- MISSION INTO RESPOND AS WELL GIVEN THAT SHE ON A DAILY BASIS IS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE -- I I I THINK WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A LIFE THAT. ALLOWS US TO NOT CONTEMPLATE. HOW THAT LITTLE AMOUNT? COULD HAVE AN IMPACT -- BUT ON A DAILY BASIS WE SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS. BASED ON MORE SOULS AND CRUMBS OF WHAT THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH -- WITH THAT. I'D SAY THE ANSWER IS A DEFINITE YES -- I WORKED WITH. SOME OF THE CLIENTS THAT I WORK WITH WHO ARE ACTUALLY RENTERS -- WILL BRING IN LOOK IN INCOME OF LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THERE AND GENERAL RELIEF -- IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH WERE THE ONLY GET TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DOLLARS A MONTH THIS IS. REALLY HE IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS IT COULD BE LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS I MEAN WE SEE THIS -- ON THE HEALTH COMMISSION THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO -- YOU JUST CAN'T GET TO THE THEN BECOMES A LARGER SITUATION THE COSTS MORE MONEY FOR THE STATE MORE MONEY FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NOW YOU GET INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE EMERGENCY -- ISSUES THAT COME UP SO -- IT DEFINITELY CAN I MEAN. THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN DOLLARS OR EVEN FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS EVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOME OF MY CLIENTS -- CAN MEAN A LOT IT CAN MEAN A LOT IN TERMS OF GROCERIES I HAVE A NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO. ARE ON CAL FRESH AND AFTER TWO WEEKS THEY RUN OUT IN THE HAVE TO GET TO FOOD BANKS. AND NOT ALL RQUIRES MONEY AND IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A LITTLE AMOUNT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS OR UPPER MIDDLE CLASS. BUT THIS REALLY IS IT'S JUST CRITICAL I MEAN I I MEAN WE'RE JUST LIKE -- REALLY ADVOCATING FOR ANY MY TV BUT POSSIBLY A THAT WE CAN GET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND BELOW IN TERMS OF THEIR INCOME THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM NORTON WORTH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M SU WE ARE CONTEMPLATING. AS A BODY AND AS CAL FOR GOVERNMENT AND NUMBER AS PROGRAMS THAT ARE YOU WOULD ADDRESS THE SAME POPULATION IN INCLUDING. CONVERSATION ON THE EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. IS THERE A REASON FOR WHY IT ADVOCATE IN SORT OF THIS STRATEGY. RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT'S TAKES MORE BROAD BASED APPROACH. I CAN START AND THEN IF YOU IF YOU HAVE -- FIRST OF ALL I THINK THEM MORE NUMBER OF TOOLS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US -- GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO GO A CERTAIN PATH IF ANOTHER PATH THAT WE WERE PLACING A LOT OF OUR HOPES ON DIDN'T WORK. SO I THINK THIS ALLOWS US TO HAVE AN EXPANDED REPERTOIRE OF UP OF PATHWAYS. THAT'S ONE OF TO I I'M I'M ALWAYS WONDERING THE QUESTION OF ALSO IF THIS IS GOING TO COST THE STATE LET'S SEE UPWARDS OF HALF A BILLION -- BUT THEN INDIVIDUALLY SOMEWHERE ROUGHLY AROUND THERE -- I'M SORRY. ONE ONE BILLION. THIS IS THE WHAT ABOUT -- IF WE ARE THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT IF IT WAS PLANTED A. B. AND BILLION REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK THE THE THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS THE MAXIMUM. POSSIBLE WHICH THEN ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE A CONVERSATION OF WHERE DO WE WANTED TO GO WHO WE WANTED TO IMPACT. THAT'LL HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. OPPORTUNITY OF THIS OFFERING ASSISTANCE OR HELP. LET'S NOT FORGET ALSO THIS PROGRAM ENDED UP GETTING THE FUNDED AT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME AS WELL. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE WERE. A HIT WITH A CONFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT ECONOMIC IMPACTS INCLUDING THE HOUSING BUBBLE. WHEN PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR HOUSES -- THERE WASN'T SOME TYPE OF A SMALL VERY SMALL RELIEF THAT THIS OFFERS. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF YOU KNOW. APPLYING AND GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. AGAIN SMALL AMOUNT AND THE QUESTION GOES. TO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE WE INVESTING AND PER UNIT CALIFORNIAN PER CAPITA WHAT IS IT GOING TO MEAN FOR THEM -- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS. OF MORE AS THIS BILL CONTINUES AND WE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE. LOOK AT WHAT VERSION OF IT. COMES OUT. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE WITH. SO I DON'T SEE IT AS AN EITHER OR I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROVIDE HELP AND ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME -- I WAS ONE OF THE DRAFTERS FOR S. EIGHTY WHICH IS OUR HOUSING FIRST BILL. AND THE REASON BASICALLY THAT THE GOVERNOR GAVE US THAT HE SIGNED THAT BILL WITH BECAUSE IT WAS A FISCAL BILL -- WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT ONCE PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS IT COST TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR US TO SERVICE THAT POPULATION. THAT MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HELP LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND LOW INCOME RENTERS YOU'RE SAVING MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- AT THE CITY LEVEL -- WITH ALL OF THE SERVICES AND WE SEE THIS AT THE HEALTH COMMISSION WE HAVE OUR ANNUAL REPORT WHICH SHOWS EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE ARE SPENDING AND SERVICES -- WHETHER IT'S PARAMEDICS EMERGENCY ROOMS EMTS -- THAT THE COST IS THERE -- I NEVER WE'VE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD THAT BILL SIGNED HAD WE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS A FISCAL BILL AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING HERE. TO ANY EXTENT THAT YOU CAN GIVE HELP TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HOUSING CURRENTLY -- TO STAY THERE AND TO PROVIDE WHATEVER ASSISTANCE YOU CAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING MONEY ON THE OTHER END. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I JUST I HAVE -- ONE SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO THE YOU'RE EXPANDING A PROGRAM THAT WAS DE FUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO WHAT IS KIND OF THE PLAN FOR THIS BILL. WHEN IS YOUR PLAN FOR THIS YOU MEAN AS FOR WHERE THE FUNDING WILL COME FROM YES? WELL IT DEPENDS. OR IT IS IT IS IT ARE YOU HAVE A BUDGET REQUESTS THAT BRENT. HELLO FROM THIS -- THERE'S GONNA BE THAT. BUT BUT GIVEN TO WHAT EXTENT THAT'S A POPULAR OPTION RIGHT NOW -- I'D LIKE FOR US TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE VIABLE. OPTION MOVING FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. SO IF THERE ARE OF OF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TAX CREDITS IF THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT -- MAKES SENSE RATHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED. WELL THEN WE WOULD JUST NEED TO REFORMULATE THIS TO SOME EXTENT TO SEE WHAT WHAT MOVES FORWARD -- OTHERWISE. THE LAST OPTION IS TO PUT IN A REQUEST FOR FUNDING AS WELL. ALL RIGHT OF THIS THIS IS A NO ACTION IS A TESTIMONY ONLY ITEM IT BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- THE ONLY THING I'D SAY IS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO DISCUSS THIS TO AT THE START THE CONVERSATION ON IT I'M SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT THIS HAD OF THIS HAD BEEN DEFINED IT AT THE TIME THAT IT DID. GIVEN HOW MUCH OF A NEED THERE WAS AT THAT TIME WHEN PEOPLE WERE BEING DISPLACED -- AND AND FOR US TO NOT HAVE REALLY -- DISCUSSED WAYS OF BRINGING THIS BACK SO -- GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE. A A GOOD OPTION OF LOOKING AT WATER THAT SENSITIVE TARGETS. AMONGST OUR POPULATION AMONGST OUR DISABLED AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT AND PROVIDING THIS. INCENTIVE FOR SERVICE. FOR SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SHE CONTINUED CONVERSATION AND HOPE I CAN WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. TO TO MAKE THIS A VIABLE YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE NEXT THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT ON AB SIX ZERO EIGHT I HAVE WHICH IS. DRESSING THE LOW VALUE ORDINANCE EXCEPTION THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPELL IS COST EFFECTIVE PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION. THE BILL DOES A FEW THINGS IT WILL RATIONALIZE EXISTING LAW GOVERNING LOW VALUE OR NEXT ORDINANCE EXEMPTIONS. ELIMINATE WASTEFUL AND INEFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SAVE MONEY FOR BOTH GOVERNMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THE BILL HAS TWO PARTS. OFFERS THE BILL ALLOWS A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO RE EVALUATE AND AS APPROPRIATE. INCREASED ITS LOWER VALUE ORDINANCE EXEMPTION TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ALL POSSESSORY INTERESTS AND SECOND IT ALLOWS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR THE NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION IN HOW TO APPLY THE EXEMPTION. FOR I GO ANY FURTHER LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT A POSSESSORY INTEREST ACTUALLY IS SO POSSESSORY INTEREST IS PRIVATE CONTROL OF PUBLICLY OWNED REAL PROPERTY SYSTEM EXAMPLES INCLUDE. A FOOD AND BEVERAGE CONCESSION AT STADIUM IN STATE OR FEDERAL PARKS CAR RENTAL COUNTERS AT PUBLIC AIRPORTS VENDOR AT THE WEEKLY FARMER'S MARKET LOCATED ON CITY ON SPACE. A RESTAURANT PATIO LOCATED ON A PUBLIC SIDEWALK SO FOR EXAMPLE OF A SMALL RESTAURANT DECIDES TO SET UP A PATIO. THAT OCCUPIES SPACE ON A CITY OR COUNTY SIDEWALK I COUNTY ASSESSOR WILL EVALUATE AND DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE PUBLIC PROPERTY BEING UTILIZED BY THE BUSINESS. AND IF THE PROPERTY IF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE THE BUSINESS OWNER IS THEN REQUIRED TO PAY TAX ON THAT VALUE. HOWEVER COUNTY ASSESSOR'S HAVE FOUND THAT THEN WE ACTUALLY END UP RECEIVING IN REVENUE. TO THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS LOW VALUE THERE FOR NEEDS TO BE RE EXAMINED AND RIGHT NOW THE LOW VALUE ORDINANCE EXEMPTION IS SET AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH SOME CATEGORIES SET AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS BILL INCREASES THE VALUE LIMIT TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ALL POSSESSORY INTERESTS WHICH IS A MORE REASONABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE THRESHOLD. I AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THIS PERMITS THE PURE PRUDENT USE OF LIMITED RESOURCES THERE WAS A MINOR CHANGE I THINK IT'S A WIN WIN. FOR GOVERNMENT AND FOR SMALL BUSINESS -- WE'VE NOTED THE COMMITTEES FEEDBACK REGARDING THE COMMITTEES TAX EXPENDITURE POLICY AND AS SUCH WE WILL BE AMENDING THE BELL. OUTLINES SPECIFIC GOALS OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES AND TO CONTAIN A FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND AS AN ASIDE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR. AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT EMPHASIS ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND ON I GOAL ORIENTED DECISION MAKING. I WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY CREEK REQUEST THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT AND AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE A SUPPORTER WHO'S HERE TO TESTIFY JESSE SALINAS IS THE YOLO COUNTY ASSESSOR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

WEARING NOT MULTIPLE HATS BUT HERE TODAY AS AN ASSESSOR I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT AB SIX OH EIGHT IS ORGANIZATIONS EFFORT TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. BY INCREASING THE POSSESSORY INTEREST X. THOUSAND AS WAS JUST SHARED -- THE APPROVAL OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THESE ASSESSMENTS. WITH A GREAT -- PROVIDE THAT UNIFORMITY THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF FIFTY THOUSAND AS AS A BENCHMARK AS WELL THAT APPLIES TO EITHER A CATEGORY SUCH IS -- THE AREAS OF OF THE AREAS OF I APOLOGIZE THE AREAS OF LEVI'S CONVENTION CENTERS CULTURAL CENTERS FAIR GROUNDS AND FOR GROUND FACILITIES. THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT WILL DECREASE UNDUE BURDEN. ON AND CONFUSION TO QUALIFYING CONSTITUENTS WHILE STILL ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY -- LOCALLY AT THE LOCAL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS AS NEEDED.

TO REDUCE INITIAL REVOLUTE REVENUE LOSSES STATE THIS BILL WOULD PHASE IN THE EXEMPTION FOR EACH RETIREE WHILE STILL KEEPING ITS GOAL OF KEEPING RETIRED VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED MENTAL TWENTY YEARS RECEIVE FEDERAL -- RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THE GOAL THIS BILL AS WE WANT TO KEEP OUR CAMP PENDLETON MARINES ARE SAN DIEGO SAILORS OR FOR WHEN SOLDIERS IN OUR EDWARDS THURMOND STAY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY RETIRE FROM THEIR SERVICE. BUT OUR TAX LAST YEAR VETERANS THE OTHER STATES WERE MISSING OUT ON THESE HIGHLY SKILLED -- EXPERIENCED WORKERS TO COMMUNITIES WERE ONE OF ONLY ONE OR ONLY ONE OF NINE STATES THAT FULLY TAXES MILITARY TYRANT BAY. AND WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF OUR VETERANS NOT BECAUSE OF THAT -- WITH THE TODAY'S CAPTAIN DENNIS TO BARRED FROM THE CHAIR HE IS THE CHAIR OF THE SAN DIEGO MILITARY ADVISORY COUNCIL TO DISCUSS -- A REPORT THEY DID IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S MILITARY COUNCIL LAST YEAR. THANK YOU AS THE CHAIRMAN GERMAN BURKE AND MEMBERS TO COMMITTEES THAT I'M DENNIS TO BART AND I'M THE MY DAY JOB IS ON THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TEAM A GENTLE AN AMEX NASCO THAT'S THE SHIPYARD IN SAN DIEGO. BUT I'M ALSO THE TODAY HERE IS THE CHAIR OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF SAN DIEGO MILITARY ADVISORY COUNCIL. AND I'M ALSO RETIRED -- NAVY VETERAN AND I LIVE IN CHULA VISTA. SO THOSE SAN DIEGO MILITARY ADVISER COUNSEL IT'S NORMALLY CALLED ESTY MAC IS A NONPROFIT FOUNDED IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR IT WAS TO FACILITATE IN ADVANCE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MILITARY LECTURED OFFICIALS CIVIC LEADERS. AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR MILITARY TO MANY CONTRIBUTION THAT BRINGS OUR REGION. AND ESPECIALLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I MERITED. THE ANALYZE BOTH THE COSTS AND THE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA FROM A PROPOSED EXEMPTION OF STATE TAXES OR MILLET RETIRED MILITARY PAY. AND I'M ALSO TO SHARE WITH YOU PERSPECTIVE THE BENEFITS THIS TAX INCLUSION WOULD HAVE UPON OUR MILITARY TYRESE. IS THEY DECIDE TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA OR MOVE ELSEWHERE. THE STUDY WAS DONE BY DOCTOR LYNN REASER AT THE FOR MANY IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTE OF POINT LOMA NAZARENE UNIVERSITY. YOU MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW DOCTOR RESERVE FROM HER STUDIES AND ALSO IS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURERS COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS. THE STUDY POINTED OUT IT WAS JUST MENTION THAT ONLY NINE STATES FULLY TAX MILITARY TYRESE IN CALIFORNIA IS -- ONE OF THOSE STATES. THE HIGH TAXES STATES OF NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS ARE AMONG A MAJORITY OF STATES THAT COMPLETELY EXEMPT MILITARY RETIRED PAY FROM TAXES. FOR MANY FACTORS IMPACT MILITARY TYRESE WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO LIVE BUT TAXES CERTAINLY ARE KEY ELEMENTS. FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF MILITARY TYRESE ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCREASED BY 16%. BUT THE SAME PER TO TIME CALIFORNIA MILLER RETIREES DROPPED BY ALMOST 17%. THIS MASS MIGRATION COSTS THE STATE REVENUE OVER THE LONG RUN. STUDY ESTIMATED THE END OF THE TAXATION MILITARY TIRE PAY WOULD INCREASE NUMBER RETIREES CHOOSING TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA BY MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND SOON GROW TO TEN THOUSAND MORE IN CALIFORNIA -- IN EACH YEAR AFTER THAT. RETENTION OF TYRESE BRINGS WITH THAT STATE REVENUES AND SALES TAX PERSONAL INCOME TAX SOME SECOND CAREER AND SPOUSES AND OTHER STATE FEES AND TAXES OVER TIME. CERTAINLY BE A NET POSITIVE GAME TO THE STATE REVENUE. ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO PERSONALIZE THIS LEGISLATION FOR YOUR MIND OFTEN ALMOST ST SAN DIEGO IT'S HOME TO HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS THEIR FAMILIES. AND APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THOUSAND MILITARY TYRESE. THE BILL TERRITORIES BRING MEDICAL SKILLS TECHNOLOGY TALENT SKILLED TRADES CERTIFICATIONS WE ARE TEACHERS FIREMAN YOUR HIVE TROLL OFFICERS NURSES AND MANY OTHER. YOU ENCOUNTER EACH AND EVERY DAY. IN SUMMARY THIS STUDY PROVIDES A FISCAL RATIONALE FOR EXEMPTING MILITARY TIRED PAY FOR A MODEST FIRST YEAR INVESTMENT ON PART. PRODUCES LONG TERM DIVIDENDS. ALSO SAY IT'S IN THE CLEAR MATCHES TO OUR RETIREES AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE AND THEIR VALUE TO FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS ESPECIALLY TO CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MEASURE -- IN ADDITION TO OUR OUR USUAL CONCERNS AND I I WON'T BELABOR THEM ALL IT'S BEEN A A LONG HEARING -- WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRECEDENT THAT THIS SET SPECIFICALLY CERTAINLY THE STATE HAS A VARIETY. OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVE -- RESIDENCE -- FIRE POLICE AS TWO EXAMPLES -- AND THIS REALLY DOES THAT ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT SET AS A BIT OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE MERIT BY WHICH SOMEONE'S RETIREMENT PAY -- SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM TAXATION CERTAINLY WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN MEASURES -- THAT WOULD EXEMPT RETIREMENT PAY FOR OTHER PARTS PROFESSIONS AS WELL. I AND AT A COST TO THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS -- TO THE STATE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS EVEN WITH THE PHASE AND WE CONSIDER THIS TO BE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT -- AGAIN AND I'LL JUST ADD ONE LAST. THIS WOULD GO OF COURSE TO ANY VETERAN REGARDLESS OF THEIR NEED -- MANY VETERANS AND AND THIS WAS. MENTIONED AND ALLUDED TO IN SOME OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS -- ARE HIGHLY SKILLED AND COULD BE COMING TO CALIFORNIA FRANKLY TO MAKE A QUARTER MILLION OR A HALF MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR SALARY -- ONLY TO ALSO HAVE THEIR RETIREMENT PAY THAN EXEMPT FROM TAXATION FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THERE IS OPPOSITION SAYING NINE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE AS A MEMBER WITH THE BASE AND HER DISTRICT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. OTHER THAN THAT. THIS IS FOR TEST MY ONLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MEAN AND WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION ON THIS CAR BEFORE I UNDERSTAND HER -- POINT OF VIEW BUT THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE IF A YOUNG MARINE JOINS AT EIGHTEEN THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OLD AND WE WANT THEM TO START A SECOND CAREER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIRTY ONE OTHER STATES OFFER THEM INCENTIVES AND WE WANT TO KEEP. KEEP THOSE FOLKS IN THIS -- IN THE STATE TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IN THE FUTURE AND IF THE MARINE AT THIRTY EIGHT MOVED TO ARIZONA THE STATE GETS ZERO DOLLARS SO.
