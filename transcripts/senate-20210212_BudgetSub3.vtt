ALMOST TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. AND

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.110

JUST OVER THE HOLIDAY SEASON

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.151
SO- HUSTLER DEFINITELY

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:33.385
DECOMPRESSING AND I SEE YOU

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:34.854
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOWER.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.922

SURGE BUT DEFINITELY ON THE

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:42.561
OTHER SIDE OF THIS- SO WE'RE

00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:44.263
SEEING VERY ENCOURAGING TRENDS

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.764
AS FAR AS THAT- AS FAR AS

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.900
MENTALITY. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.003
THOUSAND AND THAT IS DEFINITELY

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.872
A LAGGING INDICATOR SO WE'LL

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.874

DEATH RATE PER CAPITA IS A

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:06.952
HUNDRED THIRTEEN PER HUNDRED

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:07.520
THOUSAND WHICH IS ONE OF THE

LOWEST PER CAPITA DEATHS

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:09.922
AMONGST THE LARGE STATES.

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.390
SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD BE

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:19.765
PROUD OF IS A STATE. FOR HOW

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:20.966

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.522
INDICATORS TO MONITOR AND

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.591
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS- AND THEN

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.126
REALLY- REALLY CRUCIAL TO ALL

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:21.927
THOSE WHICH OF COURSE ISN'T

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.062
HIGHLIGHTED THROUGHOUT THIS

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.530
PANDEMIC IS HOW. IMPORTANT FOR

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:27.399
DATA THE I. T. SYSTEMS ARE SO-

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:29.468
MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.236
RISE UP AND THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.604
A THEME CERTAINLY AROUND THIS

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.472
RESPONSE AND MY DISCUSSION OF

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.241
THAT OF OUR SECOND STRATEGY OF

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:36.709
COURSE IS DEVELOPING A POLICIES

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.244
THAT THEN YOU KNOW OUR INFORMED

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.478
ABOUT IT BY THAT DATA AND

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.446
SUPPORT THIS MISSION SO

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.780
PROVIDING A SCIENCE BASED

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.115
EVIDENCE BASED FRAMEWORK FOR US

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.783
A FREE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.651
TO MINIMIZE THESE HEALTH

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.920
IMPACTS- SO EVERYTHING WE'VE

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.321
DONE TO DEVELOP THE BLUEPRINTS-

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.991
FURCIFER. WITH THE TEARS ALSO

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.792
DEVELOPING ALL THE SAFE- SORT

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.261
OF GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS AND

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.763
DIRECTIVES WE HAVE RELATED TO

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.330
DIFFERENT SETTINGS INCLUDING

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:05.070
SCHOOLS. REOPENING AND OF A

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:08.107
PRODDING AT GROUPON. AND ON- WE

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:08.807
WANT OF COURSE ALLOW. ALL OF

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:09.541
PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:11.076
POLICIES ACTION WITH CHANGING.

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:14.446
IN OF PENN. WHICH BEEN RAPIDLY

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:15.948
CHANGING OVER THE ENTIRE AT NOW

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:18.050
SIR. MY I THINK WE'RE ARE IN

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:21.453
THIS AND THEN I. THE THIRD

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.055
STRATEGY IS- MITIGATE AND

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:23.956
SUPPRESSING COME NINETEEN SO

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.658
MID. BY AGAIN DIRECTING PREVENT

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:26.959
EFFORTS AND NONE OF OUR IS

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:28.494
STILL GOING- TO MINIMIZE THE-

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.095
HEALTH. OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:30.663
THE MORE EXTREME IN THE OF

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.031
COURSE IS A STATE ORDER.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.465
MASKING ALL OF THOSE IN. NOT

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.634
PHARMACEUTICAL. AND THEN

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.502
SUPPRESSING AND CONTAINMENT IS

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:37.503
REALLY ABOUT TO FOR PROVIDING

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:38.871
SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO OUR

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:39.972
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.106
ARE THEN DOING THE CASE

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.008
DETECTION WHICH IS TESTING-

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:43.676
WE'LL TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:45.144
LABORATORY PASSED IN TESTING

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.146
THE NEXT QUESTION- AND THEN

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.614
ONCE YOU DETECT THIS CASE IS

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.748
YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.183
AND THEN YOU DO CONTACT TRACING

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.451
AND THEN. ISOLATION AND

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:53.786
QUARANTINE SO ALL OF THOSE

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:54.820
EFFORTS ARE JUST PRESSING

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.221
CONTAINS SPECIALLY WHEN THEIR

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.656
CASE NUMBERS ON LOTTO. AND THAT

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.091
REALLY IS THROUGH THE ARMS OF

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.559

EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS FOR THESE

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:48.060
GROUPS. AND THEN THE LAST TWO

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:50.128
AND STRATEGIES GO HAND IN HAND

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.096
WHICH IS PARTICIPATING IN A

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.130
COORDINATED STATE GOVERNMENT

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.665
AND ALL OF GOVERNMENT ALL THE

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:54.867
STATE APPROACH REALLY TO

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.268
MOBILIZE YOU KNOW THIS IS A-

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.970
ONCE IN A LIFETIME PANDEMIC AT

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:00.205
LEAST WE HOPE- AND REALLY NEEDS

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.640
ALL HANDS ON DECK SO. WE'VE

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.475
BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH

THAT AND- AND ALSO AGAIN A

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.794
THEME OF DEVELOPING UNIFIED

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.029
DATA SYSTEMS AND ANALYTICAL

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.163

HEALTH A RESOURCES ACROSS THE

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:33.005
STATE- THE THIRD QUESTION WAS

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.907
TO. FOCUS ON TESTING CAPACITY-

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:35.974
INCLUDING THE PROBLEMS OF

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.309
DIFFERENT TESTING METHODOLOGIES

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.277
AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:38.944
DEPLOYMENT THROUGHOUT THE

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.680
STATE. SO ARE- TESTING CAPACITY

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.248
WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A CAPACITY

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.817
THAT AND ONE POINT IS EXCEEDED

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:46.451
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PCR TEST

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.120
TODAY. AT THE PEAK OF OUR

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.055
SEARCH THERE ARE SEVERAL DAYS

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.990
WHERE VOLUME WAS OVER FOUR

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:52.558
HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY AND

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:53.191
OUR VOLUNTEER BRANCH I'VE STILL

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:54.826
HAS. MORE CAPACITY THAN

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:55.894
ACTUALLY HAS BEEN UTILIZED YET

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:59.331
SO- WE HAVE AGAIN OVER FIVE

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.966
HUNDRED THOUSAND PIECE OUR

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.167
CAPACITY TESTS TODAY- THAT'S

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.035
STILL THE GOLD STANDARD FOR

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.236

B. TO RUN UP AND OF MARCH. AND

00:25:58.723 --> 00:25:59.357
EACH FACILITY GETS THREE

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.359
CLINICS- FOR FACILITY CHIANG

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:02.327
MAI SURE THOSE TWO DOZEN

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.195
PURPOSE. GET IN WITHIN THOSE

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:05.597
CLINICS. AND THEN STARTING THIS

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:07.465
WEEK THE CDC IS STARTING A NEW

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:11.469
FEDERAL. PART WITH- SUB FEDERAL.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.904
SO IT'LL BE ADDITION TO OUR

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.706
STATE ALLOCATION- THE

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:16.074
APPLICATION IS ONLY A MILLION

DOSES FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:18.944
PER WEEK NATIONALLY SO IT'S NOT

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.246
A HUGE AMOUNT FOR CALIFORNIA-

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:22.414
BUT IT IS YOU KNOW AGAIN

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.548
ADDITIONAL JUST IS COMING TO

THE STATES AND AS ACTING SUPPLY

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:27.118
INCREASES. ADDITIONAL LOCATION

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.053
THEN PARTNERS WITH FEDERAL

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:29.421
PHARMACY PROGRAM CONTRACTS WILL

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:32.390
RECEIVE VACCINE- THE ULTIMATE

00:26:32.457 --> 00:26:33.792
GOAL FOR THAT IS IF. NETWORK OF

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:36.194
THOUSAND LOCATE. AS THE CDC

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.529
RECOMMENDED THAT WE WORK

STEP BY THE STATE- SO WE'RE

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.355
WORKING CLOSELY TO DEVELOP THIS

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:52.023

DASHBOARDS AND SO THAT'S BEING

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:07.405
ROLLED OUT IN WAVES- THERE'S

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.006
THREE WAYS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.007
IDENTIFIED WE'RE NOTIFYING

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:14.946
THAT- COUNTY IS THIS. THE WEEK

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:17.048
ON- OF HOW THOSE AWAYARE. ARE

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:20.718
DESIGNATED. MOVING ON TO- THE

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:21.886
QUESTION WAS TO HAVE DATA ON

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.488
AFFECT OF IDENTIFICATION AND

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.691
CONTACT TRACING- ARE CHEN OF

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.259
NINETY AND WELL HAVE WE LEARNED

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:30.261
CUT RAISING TO PANAMA THAT MAN

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.163
MORE BECAUSE IN EFFORTS AND

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.266
FUTURE- I THINK ALSO JUST WAS

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.502
YOU KNOW- WE AND LOOK HEALTH OF

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:39.337
OUR DO QUE AND HUNTER IN THE

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:40.705
STATE FOR MANY OTHER DOES.

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:41.573
AGAIN THE MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.241
OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS HAS MADE

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:44.342
IT EXTREMELY CHALLENGING YOU

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.477
KNOW IN THE MIDST OF SEARCHES-

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.812
AS FAR AS OUR DATA YOU KNOW

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:49.147
AGAIN THIS IS A CRUCIAL PUBLIC

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.082
HEALTH TOOL FOR CONTAINING THE

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.684
SPREAD OF. THE NINETEEN AND

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.652
OTHER DISEASES- AND IT'S MOST

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.887
EFFECTIVE WHEN CASE COUNTS ARE

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:56.955
LOW ALLOWING FOR CASES AND

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.423
EXPOSE CONTACTS BE REACH MORE

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:00.191
RAPIDLY THE TESTING TURNAROUND

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:01.893
TIME IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.894
AS FAR AS A LESSON LEARNED WITH

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:06.497
THAT- SO IT IS DIFFICULT AGAIN

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:08.800
WHEN THERE ARE HUGE SURGES- TO

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:10.368
MAINTAIN THAT AND REALLY SHIFT

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:11.703
SORT OF FROM THE SUPPRESSION

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:12.770
WHICH CASE AND CONTACT

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:14.005
INVESTIGATION THOSE TO THE

00:31:14.072 --> 00:31:15.506
MEDICATION WHICH IS WHY. FOR

00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:16.975
EXAMPLE WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.042
REGIONAL STATE HOME ORDERS OR

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:18.710
OTHER MUCH LARGER

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:21.546
INTERVENTIONS- SO WE DO HAVE

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.681
CDC PERFORMANCE METRICS TO THAT

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:24.616
MEASURE CONTACT RACING

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.484
PERFORMANCE STATEWIDE AND THEN

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:27.118
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.386
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:30.054
SPECIFIC IMPACT OF STATEWIDE

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.689
CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS BUT

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:32.557
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:34.025
OF LOCAL PROTOCOLS AND DATA

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:35.927
SYSTEMS- ARE CAL CONNECTS TO SO

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.629
MUCH- HAS EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.364
OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS HAS

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.732
CIGNA VARIATIONS AND EVEN HOW

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:41.666
EACH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.501
UTILIZING THE DATA FIELDS. BUT

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:44.769
WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS WE HAVE

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.871
A FIFTY FOUR HELP JURISDICTIONS

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:49.307
ARE NOW USING IT AND- FORGET

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:50.608
THE PROPORTION OF CASES THAT

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:52.777
ARE IN IT NOW BUT IT REALLY IS-

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:55.013
A GREAT I'VE BEEN TATIAN THAT'S

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:55.613
HAPPENED TO THIS PENDING THAT

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.515
REALLY HELPS US HAVE INCREASING

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:05.390
STATE DATA ON ON THAT PIECE. OF

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:07.458
IT- I THINK THE MOST THING MY

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:08.393
BE TO. PROVIDE IN A- OF THE

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:09.527
IMPACT OF CONTACT. SO SANTA

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.729
CLARA- WAS ONE OF THE- KNOWS

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:12.664
YOU KNOW WHETHER EARLY DOCTORS

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.197
OF THE SITE. COUNTY THAT

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.666
ADOPTED CONNECT. AND THEY

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:16.034
LOOKED A DIFFERENCE OF. K. WHO

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.602
ARE NOW. TO THE LOCAL HEALTH-

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:19.937
AS CONTACT IN CASE WHO ARE NOT.

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:20.738
AND WHEN NEW CASE HAD ARE BEEN

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:23.041
RECENTLY. REACH A CONTACT

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:23.875
RESOURCE TO NOTIFY THEM THAT

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.410
THEY WERE A CONTACT. THOSE

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:26.444
CASES WHERE ARE YOU STAYING

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:27.612
HOME BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.314
QUARANTINE INSTRUCTIONS. AND

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.615
THEN NOT EXPOSE ANY NEW

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:32.016
CONTACTS SO THEY DID BECOME

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.718
DEAD ENDS FOR TRANSMISSION. AND

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:34.552
THE PROPORTION OF THAT WAS

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.587
NEARLY DOUBLE- COMPARED TO

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:37.855
CASES WOULD NOT BEEN IN CONTACT

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.490
AND HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:41.492
THANK CONTACT TRACING. OF FEWER

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:42.860
CASES WERE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.829
CONTACTS WERE NOT IN ISOLATION.

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:47.031
AND THAT- SO THAT DECREASE THE

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.466
LIKELIHOOD DISTANCE BRAD'S WAS

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:51.469
5% COMPARED TO FIFTEEN PERCENT-

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.237
CONDUCT RACING'S ALSO FOUND AN

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.939
OVERALL SLIGHTLY HIGHER SUCCESS

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:55.506
RATE REACHING THE CASE. THEY

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:57.575
HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN KNOWN AND

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.476
REACHED AS A CONTACT. OF AND

00:32:58.543 --> 00:32:59.544
THAT OF COURSE NOW IS WHEN I.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.145
BY CALIFORNIA NOTIFIED WE HAVE

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:02.980
OVER NINE MILLION USERS TO THAT

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:05.350
THAT HAVE THE- ANONYMOUS

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:07.051
IDENTITY. IF THEY'VE BEEN IN

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:12.724
CONTACT WITH FOREIGN ROLLED.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.058
THE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE FROM

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.794
COUNTY TO SKI YOU A OF- A MORE-

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:19.630
GRANULAR. AT OF THE IN. I AS

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:20.631
FAR AS THE KEY LESS LEARNED- I

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:21.999
ALREADY MET THE FASTER ONTO

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.601
RESULTS CRUCIAL WE NEED TO.

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.703
LOOK UP AND ABOUT A CASE

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.438
QUICKLY AND TO REACH AND

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.974
CONTACT. TO FINE BOTH CASES

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.309
INCOME. ARE THEIR PAIN THAT THE

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.844
TIME INFECTION PERIOD IN

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:38.916
KEEPING PERIOD- I. NEEDS TO BE

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:42.253
SCALED RAPIDLY- SO AGAIN WE

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.622
WERE ALREADY- I THINK AS PUBLIC

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:45.990
HEALTH SYSTEM YOU KNOW.

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:47.759
PROBABLY WERE UNDER RESOURCE TO

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:48.793
DO THE CASE AND CUTTING

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.894
MEDICATIONS WE NEED TO DO FOR

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.696
THE OTHER. OVER AT REPORTABLE

00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.831
DISEASES AND- AND THEN HAVE

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:55.066
THIS PANDEMIC ON TOP OF THIS I

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.335
THINK WE- TRYING TO MOBILIZE

00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:58.503
YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.872
ACROSS THE STATE AND- DID AN

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.440
AMAZING JOB TRAINING AS WELL

00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:03.741
WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:04.909
UC'S OF RITUAL TRAINING

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:06.477
ACADEMY. BUT I THINK AS FAR AS

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:07.745
A LESSON LEARNED WE NEED TO

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.547
REALLY MAINTAIN A REALLY ROBUST

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.348
PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:12.016
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT- IT

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:14.051
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SET UP. IN

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:16.320
SUCH A AN URGENT WAY- WE HAD A

00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:17.488
VERY VERY SMALL EXISTING

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:18.723
WORKFORCE EXPERIENCE

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.558
INVESTIGATORS THE NEED TO-

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.461
QUICKLY TRAIN AND LEAD OTHERS

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:24.495
TO DO THAT. I THINK THE OTHER

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:25.329
LESSON LEARNED IS THAT YOU

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:27.365
KNOW- IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:28.132
WILLINGNESS OF INFECTED

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.667
INDIVIDUALS TO SPEAK TO CASE

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.968
AND CONTACT INVESTIGATORS AND

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:33.104
SHARE INFORMATION- IS REALLY

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.138
TERRIBLE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.506
GENERAL PUBLIC TO ANSWER CALLS

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:36.574
AND TEXTS FROM THE HEALTH

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.942
DEPARTMENT AND ENGAGE WITH

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.578
CONTACT RACING IS- IS VERY ABLE

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.713
SO- THIS REQUIRES INVESTMENT

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.048
AND PUBLIC EDUCATION A

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.550
MESSAGING IN MANY LANGUAGES TO

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:47.385
ENCOURAGE ENGAGEMENT LOCALIZE

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.486
COMMUNICATION EFFORTS AND

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.420
PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.988
BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR TRUSTED

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:53.591
STAKEHOLDERS- AND AGAIN A WORK

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.026
FORCE THE NEEDS LANGUAGE NEEDS

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.427
OF CALIFORNIANS AND CULTURALLY

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.062
COMPETENT WORK FORCE- WITH

00:34:58.129 --> 00:34:59.297
CLIENT CENTERED PRACTICES OF

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.065
THOSE ARE. SOME HUGE LESSONS

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:01.966
LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.468
MAINTAIN TO KEEP US PREPARED

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:05.636
FOR ALL INFECTIOUS DISEASES. OF

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:06.804
THE ABILITY TO OFFER RESOURCES

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.939
FOR INFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:10.041
ISOLATE QUARANTINE. SO THINGS

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.342
LIKE WAGE REPLACEMENT SO THEY

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.210
CAN PROPERLY ISOLATE OR

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.678
QUARANTINE HOUSING FOOD

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:15.279
DELIVERY DURING SITUATIONS TO

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.681
REALLY MAKE SURE WE CAN

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:18.816
INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION- OTHER

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:19.917
POLICIES THAT COULD SUPPORT

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:20.918
THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT OR

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.053
INCENTIVES TO ENSURE BUSINESSES

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:25.623
SUPPORT QUARANTINE AND

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.257
ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:27.191
STAFF. OF AND THEN OF COURSE

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:28.559
AGAIN THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:30.628
AND OBTAIN A CASE DATA AND

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.997
CONTACT DATA- TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.966
HAVE A REALLY- INFORMED.

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.801
ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:40.605
STATEWIDE- AND THAT REALLY-

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.240
ROBUST DATA SYSTEMS AND IT

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.808
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN ALSO-

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.009
HELP US WITH STRONG

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.544
INTERJECTION COMMUNICATION IN

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.845
COORDINATION TO IMPROVE SPEED

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:48.980
AND EFFICACY OF TRANSFERRING

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:50.748
CASES AND CONTACTS BETWEEN.

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:51.716
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:53.851
pSHARING DATA AND TACKLING

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:57.455
OUTBREAKS TOGETHER. SO THE LAST

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:59.156
QUESTION I AM GOING TO BE

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:00.725
ADDRESSING IS- HOW IS THE

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:01.759
CURRENT CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:03.127
HIGHLIGHTED GAPS IN READINESS

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.729
THAT MIGHT HELP THE STATE AND

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:05.830
DPH TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.865
PANDEMIC. WHAT WOULD CAUSE CHEN

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:08.666
ADEQUATELY RESOURCE

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.835
PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS SO AGAIN

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:13.337
JUST TO KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:14.472
IS SUMMER IS A LOT OF WHAT I

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:15.506
HAD ALREADY SAID THAT I THINK

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:16.474
YOU KNOW CORE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.944
INFRASTRUCTURE IS REALLY. A ONE

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.479
OF THE HUGE GAPS AND I THINK

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.347
THE TWO MAIN AREAS ARE STAFFING

00:36:23.414 --> 00:36:25.249
SO HAVING YOU KNOW ROBUST

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:28.319
EPIDEMIOLOGY- EXPERIENCE CASE

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.320
AND CONTACTED THE SKATERS

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.989
OUTBREAK INVESTIGATORS- HAVING

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:34.025
THE CAPACITY TO DO- MORE

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:35.526
SOPHISTICATED DATA ANALYSIS AND

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.861
MODELING HAVE BEEN REALLY.

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.129
HELPFUL WE GOT DEVELOP SOME

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.196
GREAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:40.498
ACADEMIC PARTNERS WHICH WILL BE

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:41.966
HEARING ABOUT LATER IN ANOTHER

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.102
BUDGET REQUEST- AND ALSO-

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.337
HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE OUR

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.338
WORK FIRST EVALUATE THESE

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:49.106
INTERVENTIONS SO. DOING THAT

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.341
BOTH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:51.709
THEN AGAIN REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.477
THE- PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.445
DEVELOPING WITH OUR ACADEMIC

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.314
PARTNERS TO FORMALIZE ALL THOSE

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.316
PARTNERSHIPS- AND THEN REALLY

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.217
OF COURSE THE INVOLVING- TOPIC

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.619
IS GENOMICS WHOLE GENOME

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:03.387
SEQUENCING AND- INCREASING

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:04.722
THEIR LEAD ANOTHER LABORATORY

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:05.823
TESTING BUT OUR ABILITY TO DO

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.757
WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING WE

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.326
ACTUALLY HAVE. ONE OF THE MOST

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:10.127
ROBUST SYSTEMS IN THE NATION-

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.762
BUT AGAIN IT'S- IT'S NOWHERE

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.064
NEAR OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.332
EXAMPLE LIKE THE UNITED KINGDOM

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.067
SO WE'RE RAPIDLY SCALING THAT

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:17.401
UP AS WELL. AGAIN WITH PARTNERS

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:19.870
SO- I THINK THE OTHER GAP AGAIN

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.639
IS INVESTMENT IN OUR DATA AND

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.407
IT INFRASTRUCTURE- BOTH THE

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:25.042
ACTUAL SYSTEM THEMSELVES AND I.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.277
T. STAFFING TO SUPPORT THAT WE

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:27.979
CAN'T. COLLECT GOOD DATA THAT

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.513
WE DON'T HAVE GOOD IT SYSTEMS

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.183
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND GOOD-

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.250
ROBUST STAFFING TO SUPPORT THAT

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:35.286
AS WELL. WHEN WE HAVE REVIEWED

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.321
OUR- AFTER ACTION APART FROM

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:38.522
THE TWO THOUSAND NINE PANDEMIC

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.857
H. ONE ON ONE IT ALSO

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.192
HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR US TO

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.193
MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:43.527
DEVELOPED FOR COVERED GOING

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.429
FORWARD. BUT UNFORTUNATE THAT

00:37:45.496 --> 00:37:47.632
AND PANDEMIC ALSO HAPPENED IN-

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.300
A DIFFICULT BUDGET TIME AND A

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:50.167
LOT OF THOSE RESOURCES

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.203
INFRASTRUCTURE- DID DISAPPEAR

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:57.174
AND I THINK THE THEME. THAT

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:57.808
WE'VE SEEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH IS-

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:58.342
HOW THESE VARIOUS SMALL.

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:00.011
INFECTION EMERGED LIKE A- SEEK

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.579
THE PRIOR PAN AND GETTING SOME

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.114
SHORT TERM FUNDING BUT THEN THE

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.181
SHORT TERM FUNDING GOES AWAY

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.950
AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED AS LONG

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.182
APPROACH AND PARTNERING WITH

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.150
OUR LOCAL COUNTIES TO BE SURE

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:47.418
WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL LAB

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:49.053
CAPACITY AND ON THE PUBLIC

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.154
HEALTH SIDE IN OUR STATE

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.155
BECAUSE WE KNOW A LOT OF

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.656
CAPACITY IS NOT ACTUALLY.

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.158
DIRECTLY FUNDED BY THE STATE

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:57.761
BUT HAS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.362
ARE COUNTY GOVERNMENT I SHOULD

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:03.133
SAY. YES YOU KNOW WHY IN THE

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.668
LAST BUDGET ACT WE PROVIDED

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.036
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.471
STATE LABORATORY STAFF

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.873
EQUIPMENT. THAT'S ONGOING. YES-

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.109
WE HAVE A LOT OF. AT LEAST IN

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:13.744
THE IN THE NEAR TERM WE HAVE A

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.446
HUGE NEED THAT'S LARGELY BEING

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:17.214
FUNDED BY ONE TIME EXPANDING

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:19.116
ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCES. AND

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:20.317
YOU KNOW AS WE ADVANCE THROUGH

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.919
THIS PROCESS AND FOR THE-

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:22.986
BUDGET I THINK WE'LL BE HAVING

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:26.123
A- MORE FOR CONVERSATION ABOUT.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.059
THE- LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS IN

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.127
PUBLIC HEALTH- AT THE

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.061
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WERE

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:32.496
FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.597
FULLEST ACCOUNTING OF BUDGET

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:35.466
YEAR EXPENDITURES IN THIS.

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:37.468
INDUSTRY BROWN IS A REALISTIC

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:40.037
OF THE RESPONSE. THE DISCUSSION

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:41.405
AS TO WHETHER THE LONG TERM

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:42.973
FUTURE OF STATE INVESTMENT AND

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.075
PUBLIC HEALTH IT WOULD BE. IS

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:45.976
GOING TO BE A COMMON

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.277
CONVERSATION AND SPECIFICALLY

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.012
ABOUT LOCAL LABORATORIES WE'VE

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.115
BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. TO RECEIVE

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.983
ADDITIONAL- EPIDEMIOLOGICAL

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.618
LABORATORY CAPACITY GRANTS FROM

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:57.054
THE CDC- MUCH OF WHICH IS GONE

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.256
TOO- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:45:59.323 --> 00:45:59.890
LABORATORIES TO EXPAND OUR

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:03.260
CAPACITY ABILITY- AND NOT ONLY

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.395
THAT- WITH WITH THE- INCREASED.

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.698
DEMAND FOR TESTING WE'VE BEEN TO STAND UP AND LENDS A

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.566
BRANCH LABORATORY. BROWN TO

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:11.568
INCREASE OUR TESTING THAT IS SO

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:12.536
I THINK WE'VE WE'VE BEEN MAKING

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.304
SOME PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT UP

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:16.006
FRONT INVESTMENTS AND- WE'RE

GONNA GO WITH THOSE AND BUT

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:18.609
WHAT WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:19.643
CREATED AND WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.612
MOVING FORWARD. I THINK WILL BE

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:22.713
AN ONGOING DISCUSSION FOR TO

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:23.914
HAPPEN THAT WITH LEGISLATION

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.883

LEAST- LAST YEAR WE HAD FOR THE

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.191
FIRST TIME ACTUALLY PROVIDE

KOBE AND- I'M HOPING WE CAN

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:42.666
BUILD ON THAT KIND OF

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.501
INVESTMENT- ESPECIALLY WITH THE

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:45.402
LESSONS WE'RE LEARING FROM

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:52.075
COVERED ABOUT NEED. TO BUILD

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:52.709

THIS. TO FOR. A NOW- WE'VE

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:01.084
REFLECT. LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:02.686
WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.154
SEVEN CASES I THINK REPORT SAYS

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.590
AND NOW WE ARE. AT OVER. THREE

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.724
MILLION THREE AND A HALF

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.459
MILLION THAT THAT HAS UCKED

00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:11.061
HAS TRANSFORMED EVERYBODY'S

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.430
LIFE IN CALIFORNIA- AND DOCTOR

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.699
PAN HAS A LOT OF A- KNOWLEDGE

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:17.067
AND WEEDS IN THIS AREA BUT I'M

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.602
JUST GONNA TALK LIKE A- LIKE A

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.971
REGULAR. PERSON WHO I HAVE TO

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:21.572
INTERACT WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:24.007
IN MY DISTRICT. RIGHT IT IT

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.542
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS JOURNEY

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.845
AND I GUESS IN IN VERY-

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:31.215
CONCRETE TERMS I'M WONDERING.

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.950
AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS OUT

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:35.752
THERE ARE WONDERING- WHAT KIND

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.087
OF WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED. WITH

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:38.522
THE FIRST PROCESS AND IN PLACE

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.389
LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT I

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:41.658
REPRESENT- TESTING WAS VERY

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.827
LATE TO GET ON. IT WOULD TAKE

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:44.361
TWO WEEKS SOMETIMES AFTER

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:46.163
SOMEBODY GOT TESTED. IN AND

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.765
HEAVILY AGRICULTURAL. COMMUNITY

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:50.367
WAITING TWO WEEKS TO FIND OUT

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:51.635
THE RESULTS OF THE TEST WAS

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.404
UNACCEPTABLE. AND THAT IS PART

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:56.373
OF THE REASON WE SPREAD AND IN

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.507
A WAY THAT WE DID BECAUSE

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.142
PEOPLE COULD NOT STAY HOME AND

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.110
CONTINUE TO WORK AND CONTINUE

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:02.879
TO CARPOOL. AND WE'VE SEEN AT

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.348
THE RESPONSE OF THOSE OUTBREAKS.

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:05.882
OUR TESTING IS BETTER NOW BUT

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:07.017
NOW I THINK WE'RE FACING THE

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:08.051
SAME THING WITH THE

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:09.553
VACCINATIONS AND WHILE I KNOW

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.587
WE'RE DOING A LOT TO GET THEM

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.322
OUT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.590
AVERAGE PERSON OUT THERE KEEP

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:14.358
SAYING WHERE DO I GET MY WHEN

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:16.026
DO I GET MINE. AND THERE'S A

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.161
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. AND I THINK

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.763
EVERY TIME WE ROLL OUT A NEW

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.199
PROGRAM OR NEW TEAR. IT

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.500
CONFUSES EVERYBODY AND I

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.601
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DATA IS

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:27.004
MOVING QUICKLY AND I UNDERSTAND

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.471
WE'VE HAD A CHANGE IN

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.139
ADMINISTRATION. BUT AT THE SAME

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.407
TIME I THINK ONE OF TH

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.942
MESSAGES THAT IT'S REALLY

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:33.777
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH IS.

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.780
CLEAR CONCISE. INFORMATION AND

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.482
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:39.449
FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE RECEIVED

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.518
THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:42.252
THAT. THAT THE HEALTH

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.620
DEPARTMENT BUT LIKE THEY HAVE

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:45.789
RECEIVED THAT AS WELL. EIGHT

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:47.624
AM. TODAY AND OFTENTIMES OUR

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:48.692
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS YOU

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.260
KNOW HAVE BEEN UNDER. UNDER

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:53.363
FIRE UNDER ATTACK- FROM. MOVE

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.299
CONSTITUENTS WHO WHO DISAGREE

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:57.267
WITH THE SCIENCE AND THEN. HAVE

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:00.270
ROOM TO QUESTION THE SCIENCE-

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.539
SO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:03.140
YOU SAY TO THE AVERAGE PERSON

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.475
WHO SAYS. YOU KNOW WE COULDN'T

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:07.077
GET THE TESTING RIGHT AND I AND

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:07.844
I'M IN THE COUNTY. I DON'T

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:09.046
BELIEVE AS A LAB AS WE KEEP

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.580
SENDING THEM OFF AND THEN. THE

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.082
DATA WOULDN'T BE INTEGRATED AND

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.617
SO. YOU KNOW AND EVERYONE'S

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:15.585
VERY. WAS FOCUSED ON THE TEARS.

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.621
AND THEN THE TEARS CHANGED. AND

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:23.927
IT. HOW SO HOW WHAT IS OUR- AS-

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:25.395
WHAT IS OUR ASSURANCE I GUESS

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.497
THAT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:29.433
TESTING. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.468
WITH OUR CONTRACT TRACERS AND

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.970
HOW WE CONTINUE TO USE THOSE-

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.906
AND NOW AGAIN WE'VE GOT. ACT

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:36.940
BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD WALGREENS

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.442
CVS AND RITE AID WE'RE JUST

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.110
GOING TO BE FOR SKILLED NURSING

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:41.511
FACILITIES BUT NOW I'M HEARING.

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.413
IT'S GOING TO BE FOR EVERYBODY.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.282
AND THEN THEN WE HAVE OUR TO

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.316
WEAR BLUE SHIELD AND KAISER

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:47.951
COMING IN. SO I JUST I THINK

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.353
THEY'RE STILL REMAINS A LOT OF

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.455
CONFUSION ABOUT WHO'S DOING

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.957
WHAT WHO'S ON FIRST- THE

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.025
COUNTIES I THINK WONDER ARE

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:55.959
THEY STILL GOING TO IT ARE THEY

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:57.861
STILL GOING TO BE INVOLVED. ARE

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.363
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING IT

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:00.464
OUT NOW THEY'VE YOU KNOW

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.665
EVERYONE'S REALLY BUILT OUT OF

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.800
SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO. TOUCH

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.135
ALL THE FOLKS WHO WHO

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:06.503
OFTENTIMES ARCHITECTURE OR NEED

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.740
TO BE- ADDRESSED. IN WILL BE

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.341
ABLE TO USE THAT SYSTEM WITH

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.844
THE NEW. THIRD PARTY AS WELL AS

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.147
WITH THE NEW ORGANIZATIONS.

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:17.714
THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING ALL

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:24.054
THAT. SO YOUR QUESTION IS JUST.

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.455
SORT OF HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.524
RESPOND TO. A RESPONSE YET.

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.459
YEAH I MEAN I HEAR YOU LOUD AND

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.962
CLEAR I THINK- I THINK A FEW

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:32.929
THINGS I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.097
LOTS OF LESSONS AND I THINK

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.232
WHAT WE'RE DOING MUCH EARLIER

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:37.634
ON NOW IS. REALLY MAKING SURE

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.870
WE INTEGRATE AN ACTUAL- EQUITY

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.872
BASED FORMULA- MOVING FORWARD

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:44.641
INTO- DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.242
AND I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:46.877
INCREASED INVOLVED OVER TIME AS

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.878
FAR AS PROVIDING RESOURCES

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.946
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT- AT

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.314
DIFFERENT LEVELS RATED. BOTH

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.716
THE COUNTING ON ALSO STATEWIDE

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:53.950
LEVEL AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:55.419
WE'RE- ALLOCATING RESOURCES

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.120
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AGAIN AS YOU

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:59.122
MENTIONED CENTRAL VALLEY- YOU

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.290
KNOW HUSBAND IS PARTIALLY

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:02.359
IMPACTED AND NEEDS-

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.393
DIFFERENTIAL RESOURCES JUST

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.863
BASED ON WHAT'S THERE SO I

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.464
THINK WE'RE NOT JUST FRESNO.

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.665
RIGHT RIGHT AND I THINK

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:09.933
COMMUNICATION ALWAYS NEEDS TO

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.468
BE YOU KNOW WE ARE CONTINUE TO

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:12.736
IMPROVE AND I MEANT THAT AND

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:15.105
ACTUALLY IMPROVED THE- LEVEL OF

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.340
RESOURCES- I THINK. WELL AS I

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:20.444
THINK I JUST I AND I THINK AS A-

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:21.545
COMMUNITY I THINK WE HEARD IS

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:23.013
JUST AGAIN THAT THIS ISN'T IT

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:24.481
CONTINUES TO RAPIDLY EVOLVE SO

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.248
AS YOU POINTED OUT

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.616
COMMUNICATION IS CRUCIAL BUT WE

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.218
ALSO HAVE TO. COMMUNICATE THE

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:30.253
THINGS CONTINUE TO CHANGE- BUT

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.054
NEED TO COMMUNICATE THEM

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.522
CLEARLY SO I THINK WE CONTINUE

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.890
TO WORK ON IMPROVING THAT

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.692
MESSAGE AND- THAT TRANSITION IS

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.027
HARD AND WE HAD SO MANY

00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.629
CHANGES- OVER THIS- NOW OVER A

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:41.131
YEAR OF THIS. THE PANDEMIC AND

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:44.034
LEARNING ABOUT THIS DISEASE- SO

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.868
I THINK YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.136
PROVE I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED A

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.103
LOT I THINK WE HAVE IMPROVED A

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.438
LOT I THINKWE ALWAYS HAVE MORE

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:49.372
ROOM TO IMPROVE AND WE ARE

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:50.740
ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT AS FAR

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.509
AS- GETTING MORE MORE CLRITY

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.611

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.588
GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:05.555
HOPEFULLY AS THE FEDERAL

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:06.456
GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO GIVE US

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:09.626

FOR EVERYBODY AND WE UNDERSTAND

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.020
THE FRUSTRATION AND WE CONTINUE

BEEN HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:10.860
AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR LETTER

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:12.328
QUESTION OF- IT'S TRUE YOU'RE

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.564
RIGHT THERE'S DEFINITELY A DATA

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.767
LAG AND GETTING- AS THE DATA

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.335
AROUND DOSES ADMINISTERED INTO

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:20.737
THE SYSTEMS AND I THINK THE

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:21.871
OTHER CHALLENGES BEEN A FEW

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:23.039
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OTHERS THE

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.474
FEDERAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:26.509
VACCINE FINDER SYSTEM. WE HAVE

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:27.811
OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY BUT

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:28.745
AGAIN THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.181
REGISTRIES- WHEN ONE STATEWIDE

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.349
THE TO REGIONALS THAT ARE-

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.018
SEPARATE AND THAT STARTED

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.920
SEPARATELY AND WE HAVE- MATHIS

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.354
AND AGAIN SO THERE'S BEEN A

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:39.656
HUGE TEAM OF PEOPLE LIKE

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:41.024
REALLY. LITERALLY WORKING

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.992
CALLING- PROVIDERS AND TRYING

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.928
TO GET ON THE GROUND DATA AND

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.029
CONTINUE IMPROVE THAT THERE ARE

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.197
A LOT OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.798
ISSUES THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT-

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:49.966
HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES TO GET

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.135
THAT DATA IN A MORE TIMELY WAY-

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:53.303
THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:55.471
ABOUT- INPUTTING THE DATA IN A

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:56.673
TIMELY WAY TO THE- THE FEDERAL

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.174
SYSTEM AND NOW OURS AND THAT'S

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:58.975
ACTUALLY THE LATEST

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.443
COMMUNICATIONS THIS WEEK ABOUT

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.978
YOU KNOW YOU MUST MUST MUST.

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.713
AND BE PUTTING THAT DATA AND

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.615
PUTTING IT IN A TIMELY WAY- AND

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:06.916
IT WILL IMPACT ACTUALLY

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:08.384
DOWNSTREAM PROVIDERS ABILITY TO

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.485
GET MORE VACCINE IF THEY'RE NOT

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:11.120
IN PUTTING IT SO. WE'VE BEEN

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.188
WORKING HARD TO PROVE THAT I WE

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:15.325
DO THINK YOU KNOW AND IT'S A

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:15.925
CHALLENGE FOR EQUITY BECAUSE I

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.160
THINK THERE ARE SOME. FRONTLINE

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:18.428
PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:19.863
EXACTLY THE PEOPLE WE NEED THEM

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:20.697
TO SERVE THE MOST BUT DON'T

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:22.165
HAVE A ROBUST I. T. STRUCTURE

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:23.199
SO THEY MIGHT BE PUTTING ON

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:24.500
PAPER FIRST AND THEN THE NEW

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.268
DATA ENTRY SO WE'RE ALSO

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.503
WORKING TO. RESOURCE THAT AS

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.706
WELL AND TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.541
ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN STILL-

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:32.709
AGAIN REGIONAL POPULATIONS THAT

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.410
WE NEED TO THE MOST. AT THE

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:36.246
DISTURBANCE WITH THE QUESTION

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:37.881
DOCTOR PANEL ASKING ABOUT I. T.

00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:38.848
I MEAN IT'S I THINK THAT IS ONE

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.950
OF. THE HUGE THINGS AND AS A AS

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.552
A SOCIAL WORKER I WORK CLOSELY

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:43.920
WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:45.188
WE HAVE BEEN UNDER RESOURCE AND

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.155
I'VE HEARD WE'VE BEEN UNDER

00:58:46.222 --> 00:58:48.024
RESOURCE FOR A LONG TIME. AND

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:49.392
NOW WE GO INTO A PANDEMIC ON

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.561
AGAIN WE SEE THE RESULT OF NOT

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.195
HAVING A ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.597
SYSTEM. BUT AS WE ALSO KNOW

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.366
THAT WITH DATA AND AS BIG AND

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:58.134
DIVERSE IS OUR STATE IS THE

00:58:58.201 --> 00:58:59.269
DATA PART OF IT AND THE DATA

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:00.303
SHARING PART OF IT IS

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.005
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND YOU'RE

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:03.573
RIGHT THOSE WITH THE GREATEST

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.608
AGREES OF DISPARITIES ARE THOSE

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:07.443
OFTENTIMES YOU DON'T HAVE. AT

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.678
THE FACILITY OR THE STAFF OR

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.146
JUST A TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.781
ALL THIS SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.116
BUILDING UP PUBLIC HEALTH WITH

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:19.022

GOES OUT A SO I GUESS MY

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.999

IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.287
IMPORTANT NOT TO GET PEOPLE'S

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.322
HOPES UP. JUST TO THEN HAVE TO

EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM

YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.377

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.483
THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.185
THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET. WHICH

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.453
THEY CANNOT MEET WHICH MEANS

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.523
THEY CAN'T OPEN SO- I JUST I

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:43.626
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.828
HAVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS OPEN. AND

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.696
THAT'S SEEMS TO BE FINDING

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.765
GOING SMOOTHLY. BUT THE

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:52.301
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:53.769
ARE LEFT TO LANGUISH AT HOME IN

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.638
FRONT OF A LAPTOP COMPUTER AND

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.807
IT IS BEEN A YEAR. TWENTY YEAR

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:58.908
AND I DON'T SEE ANY END IN

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:00.643
SIGHT AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:03.379
TEARS ON HERE. AND I SEE THE

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:06.615
YELLOW TEAR WHICH IS ONE CASE

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.551
OR LESS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:11.487
PEOPLE IN EVEN IN THAT TIER.

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:12.988
THERE ARE STILL SOME PRETTY

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.957
SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS SO

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:18.260
WHAT WILL IT TAKE. TO ALLOW

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.895
PEOPLE TO OPERATE IN THE MANNER

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.363
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO OPERATE

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.665
WHAT WILL IT TAKE WILL IT TAKE

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:25.067
COMPLETE ERADICATION OF. ANY

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.770
AND ALL CORONAVIRUSES BECAUSE I

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.939
DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. SO I

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.807
WILL SAY THAT I DO THINK WHAT

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:32.842
WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.610
CAREFULLY ON IS MAKING SURE WE

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:37.179

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.414
RAMBLINGS AND SUCCESSFULLY

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.883
OPENINGS. AND OUR SCHOOL STAFF

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.017
NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.385
RETURNING TO SCHOOL AND THAT

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.621
IS- EXACTLY WHAT IS HEALTH AND

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.423
FORM- THEY CAN AND WE'VE BEEN

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:48.858
DOING A LOT OF EDUCATION AND

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.025
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:52.761
LAST. FEW MONTHS OF- REALLY

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:55.097
SHOWING- THAT YOU CAN DO THAT

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:56.398
SAFELY IF YOU MASS YOU HAVE

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.000
DISTANCING OF CONFEDERATION

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.970
COHORTS- AND ALL THAT IS- THIS

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.004
THING ORIGINAL BUT WE ALSO NEED

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.406
OUR- SCHOOLS TO BILLS THEY

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.175
FRIEDMAN RETURNING AND THAT IS.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.676
NOT AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE WE

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.078
HAVE WORKED ON IN ORDER TO.

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:13.949
MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOL.

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:14.583
STAFF AND COMMUNITIES ALLSTATE.

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.818
OKAY WELL I. THAT RESPONSE BUT

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.586
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. THIS IS

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.654
ALREADY HAPPENING THAT IT IS

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:19.822
HAPPENING SAFELY IN THE

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.357
TEACHERS DO FEEL SAFE GOING

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.525
BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.592
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:24.260
IT IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.061
SETTING. WE'RE JUST KEEPING THE

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:27.563
PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS THE VAST

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.430
MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.266
CALIFORNIA. FROM BEING ABLE TO

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.300
DO SO AND I AM AS YOU CAN

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.335
IMAGINE AND- I'M SURE CLEARLY

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.970
SEE I'M VERY FRUSTRATED BY THAT

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.773
AS ARE. A LOT OF PEOPLE- THAT

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.241
THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:42.511

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:49.385
THEIR SEASONS WITHOUT- ANY

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.654
MAJOR PROBLEMS. AND I AM

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.423
WONDERING WHY WE ARE NOT-

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.892
ALLOWING THAT. TO BE REPLICATED

FALL OUT OF THE WORK FORCE AND

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:13.148
WE KNOW A LOT OF THAT IS

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.550
BECAUSE OUR SERVICE INDUSTRIES

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.751

WILL BE USED YOU KNOW BEYOND A

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.431
CODED AND BAR MULTIPLE DISEASES

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:23.999
I THINK. YOU KNOW INNER IS

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.000
REALLY COMFORTING EMPIRE

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.168
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND HAVING

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:28.703
A CONTACT DATABASE- WHICH WE

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.738

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.139
THAT'LL BE VERY THIS WOMAN

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.574
PARTY THINK. YOU'RE A VERY

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.209
IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT DURING

THE MIDDLE THE SURGE YOU KNOW

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.111
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.849
COMBINATION OF. JUST THE

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.284
ABSOLUTE NUMBERS MAKE IT MORE

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.553
DIFFICULT TO REACH- CASES AND

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:45.987
CONTACTS AND SO I THINK AT THE

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.256
PEAK OF. THINGS YOU KNOW IT

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.092
SOMETIMES WAS LESS THAN HALF OF

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.961

THINGS THAT LEVERAGE BUT AGAIN.

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:58.767
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RICH

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.569
ARTISTRY OPERATION BUT WE DO

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:01.536

MORE MORE INTERNET TO LINK THAT

TO YOUR- LABORATORY TESTING-

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:10.779
DATA RESULTS SO THAT WHEN

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.147
SOMEONE GETS NOTIFIED OF THEIR

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.648
TEST RESULTS THEY CAN ALSO GET.

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.550
CODE TO RESPOND TO THAT SORT OF

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:17.152

TO KIND OF LEVERAGE THAT

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.393
TECHNOLOGY AND HELP LOCAL. ARTS

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.862
PRIORITIZE THERE'S BEEN A LOT

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.364

CREATE. I THINK IT IS

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:53.054
DEFINITELY CHEN IN THE A START

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.290

AND- KIND OF RE LOOKING AT THAT

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.833

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.264
TO- CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. I

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.667
WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT-

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:41.970
WELL- YOU KNOW I THINK MY- GOOD

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.972

HAVE TO WAIT TO GET TO ZERO- WE

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.842
MAY NOT AND- AND- YOU KNOW

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:48.643
THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:50.011
QUESTION I WOULD POINT OUT THAT

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.313
ACTUALLY THERE ARE COUNTRIES

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.048
THAT HAVE GOTTEN. PRETTY CLOSE

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.016
TO ZERO. AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.585
IS THAT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.953
AUSTRALIA. WHEN THEY HAVE AN

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.454
OUTBREAK THEY ACTUALLY CLOSE

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.156
EVERYTHING DOWN UNTIL THEY GET

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:02.924
DOWN TO ZERO THEY DON'T. OPEN

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.459
THE THINGS UP WHEN THINGS ARE

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:05.794
LOWER DAY ACTUALLY WAIT TILL

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.662
THEY GET IT DOWN TO ZERO

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:08.797
SOMEONE MILBORNE HAD OUTBREAK

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:10.732
THEY- COLLECT EVERYTHING DOWN

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.667
UNTIL ZERO. I WAS ELECTED THE

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:14.269
THING DOWN. THEY DON'T ALLOW

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:15.036
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T ALLOW

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.705
PEOPLE RUN AROUND WITHOUT MASKS

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:17.806
AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THEIR

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:20.108
PEOPLE SO- I HOPE. YOUR HELP WE

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.943
CAN. MAYBE THAT'S A POLICY

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.612
THAT- THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.513
OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE- IF

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.915
WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.851
THIS. IS THAT- YEAH WE KNOW

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.720
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- WE'VE

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.255
SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES DO IT THE

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.690
QUESTION IS THAT. DO WE HAVE

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.926
THE WILL TO DO THAT. HERE NOW

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:38.927
IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING FOR A

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:41.062
STATE TO DO IT ALONE- BECAUSE

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.364
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T. STOP PEOPLE

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.898
FROM COMING ACROSS OUR BORDERS.

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:47.435
FROM OTHER STATES- BUT- I THINK

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.704
THAT IF PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY-

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.905
WANTED HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.240
ABOUT TRYING TO REOPEN SCHOOLS

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.942
AND BUSINESSES. HOPEFULLY THEY

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.343
ALSO WILL BE SERIOUS ABOUT

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.578
SUPPORTING THINGS LIKE

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.179
REQUIRING PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:00.849
AND- ENFORCING DISTANCE- PUBLIC

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:03.018
HEALTH ORDERS. ARE SOMEONE WE-

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.586
GIVE PEOPLE PASSES TO VIOLATE

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:06.087
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS- WE ARE

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.489
ESSENTIALLY UNDERMINING ABILITY

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:10.692
TO STOP THIS. A PANDEMIC. AND

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.060
PEOPLE OF DUNDAS OTHER

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.128
COUNTRIES HAVE DONE THIS

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:15.363
WITHOUT THE VACCINES EVEN. SELF

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.598
CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO WORK

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:23.004
ON VACCINATIONS AND- BUT- IN

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:23.605
THE MEANTIME UNTIL WE TRY TO

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:24.105
GET TO THE PLAY. WHERE

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:24.739
COMMUNITY WHICH WILL TAKE US A

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.374
WHILE I MEAN EVEN. ONCE THE

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.676
EVEN ONCE WE GET ENOUGH VACCINE

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:28.777
FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS IT WE

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.145
STILL HAVE WORK TO DO EVEN

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.046
BEYOND THAT TO GET TO THAT

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.649
PLACE- WE ARE. GOING TO- NEED

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.552
TO. INVEST IN THAT. MAYBE JUST

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.521
ONE OTHER. QUESTION AND I DON'T

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:42.190
KNOW WHETHER IT'S HERE AND-

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.592
WELL MAYBE DOES THAT ALLEN'S

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.461
ASK IT NOW- WHAT KIND OF

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.063
INVESTMENTS ARE WE MAKING AND

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.064
I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT THE-

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.832

BUT- IN TERMS OF THAT EDUCATION

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.839
PIECE RIGHT WE- WE YOU KNOW. WE

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:59.407
NEED TO PERSUADE THE L. WE NEED

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:00.408
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THE

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:01.910
VACCINES AND ANSWER DIRT

MOST PROVIDERS COMMUNITY HEALTH

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.411
CENTERS EXPERIENCED MASSIVE

01:49:11.478 --> 01:49:13.580
DROPS IN VISITS. BECAUSE WE ARE

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:14.681
DENTAL PROVIDERS WE HAD TO SEE

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:16.549
THE CLOSED TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.351
OUR DENTAL SITES. WHICH ARE NOW

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.020
RAMPING BACK UP WE HAD TO

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.321
FURLOUGH STAFF TEMPORARILY

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.089
CLOSED SITES AND WE'VE HAD AN

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.858
OVERALL CONSTRUCTION OF STAFF

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:26.593
BECAUSE THEY AYE AYE THERE ARE

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.061
BEING INFECTED BY CO THAT THEY

01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:29.462
HAD TO QUARANTINE FROM.

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:30.997
EXPOSURE TO COVET AND WE ALSO

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:33.566
HAD TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN AT

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:34.167
HOME FROM THE SHELTER IN PLACE

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:36.303

TREATMENT AS WELL AS VACCINES.

01:49:38.571 --> 01:49:40.974
THE WITH TESTING CENTERS. ARE

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.342
TESTING BUT NOT NEARLY IN THE

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:43.910
LARGE TESTING EFFORTS THAT WE

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:46.279
HAD ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED- SOME

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:47.080
DID AT THE BEGINNING BUT

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:48.114
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:50.684
RESOURCES AND STAFF AND WE

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:51.284
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.786
THAT STATEWIDE. THE HEALTH

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.321
CENTERS THAT ARE DOING NOT

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:55.588
LARGE TOPPING EFFORTS TEND TO

01:49:55.655 --> 01:49:56.556
BE THOSE PARTNERING WITH HEIR

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:58.692
COUNTIES AND ARE RECEIVING

01:49:58.758 --> 01:49:59.192
SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTY

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:01.261
PARTNERSHIPS. ONE OF FLAG THAT

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:01.861
FIVE HEALTH CENTERS ARE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.563
PROVIDING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.265
AND FUSION THERAPY AND MANY

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:06.933
MORE ARE PREPARING TO DO SO.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.135
THIS THERE APPEARS FOR ACUTELY

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:11.404
COVERT POSITIVE PATIENTS. I

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.073
MEAN IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE ON TO

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:14.074
BE VACCINATING THEM AT THIS

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.108
POINT BUT IT HELPS PREVENT

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:17.177
HOSPITALIZATIONS IN A REALLY

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.379
IMPORTANT TOOL. UP AS TO

VACCINES WE ARE HOPING THE

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.082
VACCINES ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.550
STORY THAN TESTING. OUR

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:24.884
EXPECTATION IS THAT HEALTH

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:26.419
CENTER SHOULD BE VACCINATING

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:27.954
ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS AT SEVEN

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:29.255

THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED TO

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:19.785
ANSWER WAS. TO DESCRIBE THE

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:22.087
IMPACT THAT THE- COMMON

I CAN CONDUCT WORK THAT IS

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:38.304
RELEVANT TO KEEPING OUR

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:41.507
COMMUNITY SAFE. I HAPPEN TO BE

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:43.843
PART OF THE UNITA SMALL UNIT

02:04:43.909 --> 02:04:45.511
WITHIN L. A. COUNTY THAT IS

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.246

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:49.348
IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW CASTLE.

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:53.018
AND WE ALSO WORK WITH- THE CDC

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:55.788
TO TEND TO- POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:59.358
ONE SPECIFICALLY IS. THAT OF

02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:02.261
CARBAPENEM RESISTANCE. OUR SO

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:04.496
THE RESISTANCE TO THESE OUR

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.632
ANTIBIOTICS HAS TO DO WITH LAST

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:08.500
MINUTE TYPE ANTIBIOTICS WE'RE

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:10.536
SEEING AN INCREASE OF THAT IN

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:13.138
OUR CLIENTELE AND ACTUALLY MORE

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:14.940
US REALLY DEVASTATED.

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:16.809
COMMUNITIES INCLUDING LONG TERM

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:18.110
CARE FACILITIES AND NURSING

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:21.046
SKILLS BUILT SKILLED NURSING

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:22.948
FACILITIES. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A

02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:24.750
HUGE INCREASE IN THE EMERGENCE

02:05:24.817 --> 02:05:28.187
OF CANADA OR AS WHICH IS A- AND

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:30.055
CHECK BOND GOLD RESISTANT EAST.

02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:31.924
THIS ORGANISM HASN'T BEEN

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:33.926
SMOKING IN THE UNITED STATES UP

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:35.861
UNTIL. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:37.863
AGO WHAT WE'RE KEEPING TRACK OF

02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:39.698
IT. AND AS A RESULT OF THE

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:42.234
REDIRECTION OF FUNDING AND

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.336
RESOURCES WE'RE SEEING A HUGE

02:05:44.403 --> 02:05:45.471
FIVE SPECIAL SOUTHERN

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:49.508
CALIFORNIA BATES OF THIS. OF

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:53.946
THIS BEAST. OUR LOS ANGELES

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:57.650
COUNTY HAPPENS TO BE- ONE OF

02:05:57.716 --> 02:05:59.785
THE FEW SITES THAT CAN PASS

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:01.987
SOME CAPACITY FOR TESTING OF

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:03.822
THE C. R. E. INTERBODY

02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:07.293
RESISTANT ORGANISMS. HOWEVER

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.761
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FINDING IT

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:09.862
BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION OF

02:06:09.929 --> 02:06:12.364
FINES AND STAFFING- WE HAVE

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:13.866
ACTUALLY HAD A DOWN ON OUR

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:16.802
TESTING TOOL ABOUT 10% WILL BE

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:17.970
USED TO TEST ONE A COUPLE YEARS

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:20.739
AGO AND I JUST THAT WE'VE HAD

02:06:20.806 --> 02:06:21.707
TO CUT DOWN ON OUR STAFFING AS

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.742
WELL DOWN TO ONE PERSON AND

02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:25.411
THEN THAT ONE PERSON WE CAN

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:27.146
ONLY UTILIZE FOR ABOUT HALF THE

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:29.682
TIME. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL YEAH

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:30.883
AND I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:32.551
EXPECT AND THAT BECAUSE OF

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:34.753
THESE ACTIVITIES AND BECAUSE OF

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:37.656
REDIRECTS ARE AND ALSO BECAUSE

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:40.426
OF BY- LACK OF SUPPORTING THE

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:41.760
BE ALL AGES THESE THINGS ARE

02:06:41.827 --> 02:06:43.829
GOING TO CONTINUE GETTING. MORE

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:46.632
AND MORE DEVASTATING BUT THE

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.133
MARKET NEEDS. ANOTHER QUESTION

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.768
I WAS ASKED TO ASK WHERE'S

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:51.670
OCKENFELS. AND LOCAL RESOURCES

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.973
BE BETTER DIRECTED TO SUPPORT.

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:58.344
MY WORK OUR WORK. I THINK WE'VE

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.379
ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS AND

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:00.846
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A

02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:03.315
RECORDING THANK YOU. THAT HAS

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:06.819
TO DO WITH STAFFING. WE NEED

02:07:06.885 --> 02:07:07.386
MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:10.289
THE WORK. WE NEED EQUIPMENT TO

02:07:10.356 --> 02:07:12.925
BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR. AND AT

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:14.159
THE GROUND LEVEL THE WAY THAT I

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:17.496
WAS WITH ACTION A BABY BASIS.

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.465
WITH MY COLLEAGUES. IT'S NOT

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:20.733
ENOUGH JUST HAVE STAFFING AND

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:23.135
SUBSEQUENTLY. WE NEED A CHEST

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:25.037
X. ROOMS STORAGE WILL NEED

02:07:25.104 --> 02:07:27.539
REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS THAT

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:32.144
KIND OF STUFF. BUT I WAS SAYING

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.312
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:34.146
IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW

02:07:34.213 --> 02:07:36.782
TECHNOLOGIES AND IN MY UNIT.

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:39.318
AND DOT WE HAD SOME CAPACITY AT

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:40.853
SOME POINT WE STILL HAVE

02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:44.523
MINIMAL CAPACITY THAT'S- WHAT.

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.392
WITHIN A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

02:07:46.458 --> 02:07:48.060
SETTING. WE CAN ADOPT NEW

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:49.962
TECHNOLOGIES ARE VERY EASILY

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:51.430
AND IF NOT WE CAN HAVE UR OWN

02:07:51.497 --> 02:07:52.464
HOME GROWN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE

02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:53.966
CAN IMPLEMENT AND EVEN SHARE

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:56.635
WITHIN OUR- WITHIN WITH WITH

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:58.670
OUR PARTNER. THAT'S IT OR OTHER

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:02.641
LOCAL. ACCOUNT BUT. BUT THIS

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:06.812
REQUIRES OBVIOUSLY TECHNICAL

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.680
EXPERTISE REQUIRES SIGNED. IT

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:10.949
REQUIRES DOCTOR REQUIRES A

02:08:11.016 --> 02:08:13.185
FUNDING FOR NEW EQUIPMENT FOR

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:22.194
NEW TESTING TECHNOLOGIES. ONE

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:23.462
OF THE MORE DEVASTATING THINGS

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:24.963
CURRENTLY THAT CAN POTENTIALLY

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:28.033
HARM AS WELL- DOWN THE LINE

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:28.567
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:08:28.634 --> 02:08:30.469
REALLY GOOD TEST. AND I THINK

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:31.870
DOCTOR POUND REPORTING OF

02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:33.839
COURSE HI FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:36.742
TESTS PER DAY. RELATED TO COVER.

02:08:36.809 --> 02:08:39.178
THAT'S GREAT. HOWEVER WE NEED

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:41.680
TO STAY ON TRACK AND ON TOP OF

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.248
WHAT'S ACTUALLY CIRCULATING IN

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:45.317
OUR COMMUNITIES. THE ONLY WAY

02:08:45.384 --> 02:08:46.652
TO DOTHAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:48.053
TO THAT WILL BE TO CONDUCT A

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.154
WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE IS NOT

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:50.656
THE STATE HAS A GREAT CAPACITY.

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:53.692
WILL. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE

02:08:53.759 --> 02:08:56.095
ALONE IN THIS EFFORT. AT THE

02:08:56.161 --> 02:08:57.296
LOCAL PUBLIC OUT THE RECORD WE

02:08:57.362 --> 02:08:59.098
HAVE SOME CAPABILITIES THAT

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:01.667
WILL COME AND GO. HOWEVER THE

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:03.068
WAY WE'RE DOING IT. WE'RE DOING

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:05.137
IT- HOW TO BEHIND THE SCENES

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:09.208
THAT TIME. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:09:09.274 --> 02:09:11.110
FUNDING FOR THE- CONSOLE

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:13.178
UNFORTUNATELY THE PERSON WHO'S

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:14.513
CONDUCTING SOME OF THE ANALYSIS

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:18.717
OF THIS DATA S. NEW FROM HOME.

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:21.820
WITH THEIR HOME EQUIPMENT. IN

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:22.888
PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.389
THAN THE NEW YORK FROM SOME OF

02:09:24.456 --> 02:09:27.092
THE LAST ELSEWHERE. WELL THAT'S

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:30.762
THROUGH DEDICATION. BUT I DON'T

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:31.663
THINK IT'S ENOUGH TO HAVE A

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.332
PROPER RESPONSE TO THESE THINGS

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:34.900
AND NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:36.935
WILL BE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:38.237
PARENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE. IN

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:40.506
ALSO SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND. WHAT

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:42.207
IS CIRCULATING OUT THERE.

02:09:42.274 --> 02:09:43.742
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

02:09:43.809 --> 02:09:44.776
LED ME THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:45.944
CASES FOUND. IN NORTHERN

AFRICAN RAND THE PUBLIC. WHICH

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:52.718

02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:55.187
SMALL TWEAK. RENDER THE ENTIRE

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:57.122

AMOUNT OF BACKS IT'LL

02:09:58.557 --> 02:10:01.059
DISTRIBUTION USED. NOW THAT'S A

02:10:01.126 --> 02:10:06.131
REALITY. SO BEST OF THE BEST

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:09.234
MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH- BOB.

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:13.472
WHAT THE SERVICE CAN BE PUT TO

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:16.508

REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:26.818
OF COMPUTING POWER WHICH FALLS

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:29.988
REQUIRES I TEASE. ANOTHER

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:31.857
QUESTION I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:32.858
WAS THAT WHAT IS THE MOST

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:34.793
CRITICAL WHAT IS ONE OF THE

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.928
MOST CRITICAL INVESTMENTS

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:36.595
NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:39.698

PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. I

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:43.302
HAVE TO JUST REITERATE STAFFING.

THE RIGHTS THAT. FOR MORE SO

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:48.540
BECAUSE WE HAVE SPAWNING BAD

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:50.509
WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS WE DO GET

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:52.578
SOME FEDERAL FUNDS AT TIMES AND

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:53.845
THEN PASSED AS A MATTER OF FACT

THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:03.855
RIGIDITY. ASSOCIATED WITH. BUT

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:06.191
EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE SOME

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.093
MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.395

ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.031
SPECIFIC ORGANISM FOR THAT

02:11:13.098 --> 02:11:15.500
SPECIFIC PROGRAM. SO WE CANNOT

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:16.935
REDIRECT ANY OF THAT MONEY TO

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:18.003

DISTRIBUTING IT THROUGH THE

CLINICS ARE YOU FINDING VACCINE

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:59.771
HESITANCY IN THE END IN YOUR

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:00.405
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT YOU'RE WORKING

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:03.575
WITH. BUT DEFINITELY FINDING

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:06.011
VACCINE HESITANCY- THAT WAS THE

02:13:06.078 --> 02:13:06.945
FOCUS THE BOLUS OF OUR

02:13:07.012 --> 02:13:08.613
CONVERSATIONS FOCUS ON THAT IN

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.482
THE FALL- BUT I WILL

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:12.984
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WITH THE

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:14.820
DEARTH OF VACCINES RIGHT NOW

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:16.054
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:17.689
MORE OF THEM SO THERE'S A

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.191
HIGHER DEMAND AT THIS POINT BUT

02:13:19.257 --> 02:13:20.726
WE WERE SEEING FOR HEALTH

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:21.526
CENTERS THAT FIRST STARTED TO

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:23.962
DO VACCINE EFFORTS. THAT THE-

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:25.564
THE NO SHOW RATE WAS AROUND A

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:26.631
THIRD SOME OF THE HEALTH

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:28.100
CENTERS ON WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:29.668
PROBABLY RELATED TO THE VACCINE

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:33.138
HESITANCY- DEFINITELY- WE ALSO

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:34.306
VACCINE HESITANCY AMONG OUR

02:13:34.373 --> 02:13:36.775
PROVIDERS. SO THAT WAS- THAT'S

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:37.609
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:38.977
TRYING TO COMBAT NOW WITH MORE

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:41.913
CONVERSATION MORE EDUCATION

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:42.981
BECAUSE OUR PROVIDERS ARE-

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:44.616
FEELING WARY AND THEN THEY

02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:45.751
DIDN'T WANT TO THEN CONVINCE

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:47.052
THEIR OWN PATIENTS IF THEY WERE

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.954
WARY TO TAKE THE VACCINES OR

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:51.757
WORKING ON THAT- SO THAT WE-

02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:53.258
ALL FEEL CONFIDENT IN DOING SO

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:55.660
IT'S DEFINITELY AN ISSUE- RIGHT

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:57.295
NOW IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL NEXUS

02:13:57.362 --> 02:13:58.463
OF OUR CONVERSATION BUT WE KNOW

02:13:58.530 --> 02:13:59.698
AS WE GET FURTHER AND WE GET

02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:01.566
MORE AND MORE VACCINES. THAT

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:02.467
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARDER AND

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:04.636
HARDER TIME GETTING TO. THE

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:06.738
MOST VULNERABLE SO WE ARE

02:14:06.805 --> 02:14:08.774
WORKING ON IT DAILY IN VARIOUS

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:11.309
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. AND ENTER

02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:12.444
TO ALL OF YOU HOW ABOUT THE

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:15.080
VACCINE HESITANCY WITHIN YOUR

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:24.423
YOUR WORKFORCE. LET'S START

02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:32.230
WITH THE HELP OFFICERS. JUST

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:33.532
JUST LIKE OUR PARTNERS AT THE

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:35.133
CLINIC SAID WE DO KNOW THAT

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.635
THERE IS A VACCINE HESITANCY

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:38.403
WITHIN VARIOUS WORK FORCES

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:41.273
WITHIN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- BUT

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:43.108
AT THIS POINT WE ARE SO FOCUSED

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.310
ON ADMINISTRATION- WE DON'T

02:14:45.377 --> 02:14:46.278
WANT TO LEAVE THOSE COMMUNITIES

02:14:46.344 --> 02:14:48.814
BEHIND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:51.016
THAT. OUR TRUSTED PROVIDERS IN

02:14:51.082 --> 02:14:52.050
THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:54.820
INCLUDES THE CLINICS INCLUDES

02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:55.887
AND COMMUNITY BASED

02:14:55.954 --> 02:14:58.356
ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN THE WORK

02:14:58.423 --> 02:14:59.391
THAT THE VALUABLE WORK THAT

02:14:59.458 --> 02:15:01.193
THEY'RE DOING TO COMMUNICATE

02:15:01.259 --> 02:15:03.829
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND THE

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:07.499
SAFETY OF YOUTH. OKAY HOSPITALS.

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:09.367
WE SAW OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE

02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:11.002
HOSPITALS WE SAW INITIAL WORK

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:12.337
FORCE HASN'T SEEN UNTIL THE

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:13.438
SECOND DOES HAVE BEEN

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:15.140
ADMINISTERED- I THINK WE WERE

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:17.209
SENT ABOUT 30% HASN'T SEEN I

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:19.244
THINK THAT'S DROPPED NOW QUITE

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.779
SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE GET TO THAT

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:23.615
SECOND DOSE- I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:27.252
DO WE HAVE UPDATED FIGURES BUT

02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:27.819
IT'S STILL AN ISSUE THAT WE

02:15:27.886 --> 02:15:30.055
NEED TO WORK ON. OKAY AND THEN.

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:31.523
THE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:34.726
OFFICERS. IT AND ALL OF YOU IT

02:15:34.793 --> 02:15:35.660
SOUNDS LIKE THIS LIKE THE

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:36.895
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT

02:15:36.962 --> 02:15:38.296
EMERGENCY MONEY WITHOUT A LOT

02:15:38.363 --> 02:15:39.898
OF STRINGS ATTACHED. YOU'RE

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:41.533
ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES THAT

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.801
YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.636
SPECIFICALLY TARGET. IN YOUR

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:46.338
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND OF THE

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:48.373
SON YOU GAVE US TWO HUNDRED

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.209
MILLION WAS THE ASK. YES AND

02:15:51.276 --> 02:15:52.677
MICHELLE GIVENS GI I'M HAPPY TO

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:55.146
TAKE THAT QUESTION SO THAT IS

02:15:55.213 --> 02:15:56.081
TO NOT JUST HAVE KIND OF THE

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:57.816
RESPONSE- RESOURCES FOR

02:15:57.883 --> 02:15:59.551
RESPONSE. I THINK EVERYBODY YOU

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:01.419
KNOW BARELY SELL ARE REALLY

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:02.888
FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC AND

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:03.822
WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US BUT WE

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:05.724
ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT LED

02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:07.359
US TO THIS POINT. AND ALL OF

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:09.027
THE CONTINUE IS RAMPING UP IS

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:10.228
THAT BECAUSE WE LACK THE

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:12.030
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEEDED.

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:13.098
SO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:14.533
ONGOING GENERAL FUND THAT WE'RE

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:15.734
ASKING FOR IS REALLY TO HELP

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.235
REINVESTMENT OF THAT PUBLIC

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.003
HEALTH WORKFORCE AND

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:19.871
INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC TO GET IN

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:21.840
BAD STAFF THAT CAN WORK ACROSS

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:23.808
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- THAT

02:16:23.875 --> 02:16:25.310
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS COMMUNICABLE

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:27.879
DISEASE STAFF. MET MET I THINK

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:29.548
ANOTHER REAL POSSIBILITY IS

02:16:29.614 --> 02:16:31.216
THAT WE'VE EXPANDED OUR STAFF

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:33.084
TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN IT WAS

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:34.185
IN SOME JURISDICTIONS KIND OF

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.220
DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THEIR

02:16:35.287 --> 02:16:36.788
DEPARTMENTS OR EVEN MORE. AND

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.023
IT WOULD BE A SHAME THAT AFTER

02:16:38.089 --> 02:16:39.391
THOSE FUNDS THE FEDERAL FUNDS

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:41.860
ARE ARE GONE FOR US TO LOSE

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:42.894
THOSE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:44.362
WORKING WITH US FOR THAT PAST

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.931
YEAR. SO WOULD REALLY BE A WAY

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.966
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD

02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:49.200
AND REBUILD OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:50.635
DEPARTMENTS WHILE ALSO

02:16:50.702 --> 02:16:52.470
LEVERAGING- THE STAFF THAT HAVE

02:16:52.537 --> 02:16:55.173
COME OUR WAY. DURING THIS

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.743
PANDEMIC. THANK YOU THIRTY PM.

GOING ON EVERY YEAR IS NOT MORE

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.633
THAN ONE THING. AND SO THIS

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.568
SHOULD IS- IT MAYBE NOT THE

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:04.803
SCALE OF CERTAINLY NOT THE

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.538

02:19:15.346 --> 02:19:16.414
WE HAD SMALLER OUTBREAKS LIKE

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.782
IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD A-

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:18.950
LOT OF MEASLES. IT SEEMS LIKE

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.719
FOREVER BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:22.353
STAFF GOT PULLED AWAY FROM

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.755

WORK TO CONFRONT MEASLES

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:26.858
OUTBREAKS WE HAD HERE IN THE

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:29.461
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- SO

02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:30.328
THIS SEEMS TO BE A REPETITIVE

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:32.564
CYCLE. HE RECENTLY GET UP

02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.833

THAT.WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:45.810
WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK NOT JUST

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:47.645
COVERT EVEN OTHER ONES AND IN

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:48.613
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:50.281
THE ON GOING WORK THINGS LIKE

02:19:50.348 --> 02:19:53.151
CHRONIC DISEASE ARE. NOW WE TRY

02:19:53.218 --> 02:19:54.085
TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

02:19:54.152 --> 02:19:57.155
HAZARDS AND TOXINS AND SO FORTH

02:19:57.222 --> 02:19:59.791

IS MICHELLE AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:15.273
START YES IT'S REASONABLE THAT-

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.307
AND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:17.675
THE LACK OF RESOURCES AND

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.310
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAD THAT

02:20:19.377 --> 02:20:20.478
MANY OF OUR STAFF WERE

02:20:20.545 --> 02:20:21.913
REDIRECTED TO REALLY FOCUS ON

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.248
COLVIN AND I'VE HEARD THIS

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:24.516
REFERENCE MORE THAN ONCE FROM

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:25.550
OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ABOUT

02:20:25.617 --> 02:20:27.385
HOW WE'VE REALLY FORMED CULVER

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:28.920
DEPARTMENTS OVER THIS PAST YEAR

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:30.321
AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER

02:20:30.388 --> 02:20:31.523
ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:33.091
STRIVING TO CONTINUE TO DO BUT

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:35.093
OURS- POTENTIALLY SUFFERING A

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:36.628
LITTLE BIT DURING THE PANDEMIC

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:37.529
AND I'LL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:39.631
WHY. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:40.698
ONLY HAD MAYBE ONE PUBLIC

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:41.966
HEALTH NURSE THAT MAYBE WORK ON

02:20:42.033 --> 02:20:43.468
HOME VISITING ORDER ADD

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:44.302
INTEREST IN PROGRAMS AT

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:46.204
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THAT

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:47.639
ONE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES VITAL

02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:48.606
TO THE BARE SPOTS IN THE

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:50.041
PANDEMIC AND SO THEY THEY'VE

02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:52.243
HAD TO BE RE DIRECTED UP PRIOR

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.778
TO THE PANDEMIC I KNOW STD

02:20:53.845 --> 02:20:55.413
RATES WAS CONTINUING TO BE A

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.881
CHALLENGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:20:56.948 --> 02:20:59.417
AND EVEN THEN OUT WE DID NOT

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:00.552
HAVE ENOUGH CAMILLE DISEASE

02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:01.820
INVESTIGATORS AND CONTACT

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.987
TRACERS TO REALLY REACH

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:04.589
EVERYONE. AND SO WHAT THEY WERE

02:21:04.656 --> 02:21:06.591
HAVING TO DO IS PRIORITIZE BY

02:21:06.658 --> 02:21:08.860
DISEASE BURDEN AND THAT AND IN

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.528
TERMS OF INVESTIGATING AND

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:12.297
GOING FORWARD THE NOW THOSE

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:13.932
SAME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE

02:21:13.998 --> 02:21:15.600
BEEN WORKING ON STDS ARE NOW

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:17.202
BEING RE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:18.703
PANDEMIC AS WELL AND I THINK

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:20.171
THERE'S A HOST OF A NUMBER OF

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:21.840
OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE WE ARE

02:21:21.906 --> 02:21:23.775
HAVING TO PULL OUR STAFF AND RE

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.376
DIRECT THEM TOWARDS THE FOCUS

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:26.811
OF THE PANDEMIC AND TO THE

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:28.513
EXTENT AND THE ONE THING I

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.981
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT. IN IN

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:31.349
OUR DEPARTMENTS THERE IS ALSO A

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:33.084
LEVEL OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING

02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:33.685
WHICH I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:35.620
SPEAKER FROM S. YEAH YOU STATE

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:37.222
AND SO THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO

02:21:37.288 --> 02:21:38.957
HOW WE CAN MOVE OUR STAFF

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:42.393
AROUND AS WELL AND SO I THINK

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.428
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD TO

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:46.064
MADE IT IS DO YOU DO YOU LOSE

02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.565
THE FUNDING AND THE FEDERAL

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:48.633
SOURCE OF FUNDING BECAUSE YOU

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:50.401
HAVE TO RE DIRECT THE PERSON OR

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:51.903
DO YOU TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT

02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:54.272
PERSON AND THEN ARE YOU AND-

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:56.174
KIND OF LOSING. A RESOURCE THAT

02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:57.542
CAN BE RE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:58.543
PANDEMIC SO THOSE ARE SOME OF

02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:04.249
THE TOUGH DECISIONS. THAT OUR

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:04.849
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:07.719
HAD TO FACE. MISTER MAYOR. YES

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:11.623
HELLO SOME TRICKY THIS YEAR YES

02:22:11.689 --> 02:22:14.225
WE CAN OKAY SO I WAS DOWN AT

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:15.793
THE LABORATORY AS A MATTER OF

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:18.029
FACT I WAS PART OF THE PART OF

02:22:18.096 --> 02:22:19.831
A TEAM THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:20.865
A TESTING FR MEASLES DURING

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:23.401
THE MARKET AS WELL AS THE- THAT

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:27.138
OUTBREAK WE HAD IN THAT THEME

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:27.772
PARK. IN THE IN ORANGE COUNTY.

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.607
ALSO DURING DURING DURING THAT

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:32.277
TIME. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO

02:22:32.343 --> 02:22:33.611
BE SENDING MOST OF OUR TESTING

02:22:33.678 --> 02:22:35.813
ACTUALLY ALL OF OUR TESTING TO

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.048
THE STATE LABORATORY WHICH IS

02:22:37.115 --> 02:22:39.317
GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE- PARTNERS.

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:40.051
HOWEVER WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:42.020
CAPACITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL AS

02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:44.222
WELL. SO AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:45.423
HAVE THAT WOULD USE THAT

02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:47.125
KNOWLEDGE IS THAT EXPECT EXISTS

02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:49.027
IN OUR LABORATORY. EVENTUALLY

02:22:49.093 --> 02:22:50.762
WITH TIME AND EFFORT WE WERE

02:22:50.828 --> 02:22:57.669
ABLE TO BRING ON- IS YOUR TESTS

02:22:57.735 --> 02:22:58.670
FOR THE DETECTION OF MIDDLE

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:00.204
SCHOOL NOW WE HAVE THAT RIGHT

02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:02.006
TO GET REAL. BUT I THINK MORE

02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:03.841
IMPORTANTLY ONE THAT I WANTED.

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.777
ILLUSTRATE IN TERMS OF STAFFING

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:08.179
IS THAT. PART OF OUR LAB IN THE

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:09.847
STATE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:12.884
UCLA. SCHOOL OF MY OF. HEALTH

02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:15.520
WHERE WE UTILIZED A STATISTICAL

02:23:15.586 --> 02:23:18.489
MODEL TO. TO KINDA ILLUSTRATING

02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:25.363
CHAU- HOW THIS. HOW THE RAPIDLY-

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:28.199
DOESN'T NEED. I WOULD BE.

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:34.639
PASSED WIDESPREAD AND SEEN. BIG

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:37.508
CLOSE THE WITH OBSERVABLE DATA

02:23:37.575 --> 02:23:38.676
SO WE SAW THAT A LOT OF THE WE

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.678
ALSO SPOKE ACCOUNT WHAT THE

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:43.348
ACTUAL CALL OF WITH ANY TO BE

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.550
SPENT THEM. AND SO WE HAVE SOME

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:49.554
ROUGH- AND BY THE WAY THIS THIS

02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:54.459
THIS. THIS STUDY- WE CAN STAY-

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:59.130
A COP OF THIS TO THE- YES-

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.866
REGIS BUT WE HAVE BEEN WE CAN

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:08.773
SAY THAT OVER TO YOU. SURE ARE

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:13.978
WE SAW THAT- AT THE END OF THE-

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.546
THE RESPONSE OF THE AND THEN I

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:17.682
OR TO THE TO THIS BRAND OF

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.550
MEASLES ARE WE ENDED UP

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:26.591
SPENDING AS- OUR FROM SOME FROM

02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:27.191
TWO THREE TO THREE FOUR EIGHT

02:24:27.258 --> 02:24:28.159
MILLION DOLLARS THIS TO TWENTY

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:33.698
THIS WALL. THAT'S WHAT WE DO ON

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:35.433
A DAILY BASIS. BUT WOULD LIKE A

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.168
LACK OF FUNDING LACK OF

02:24:37.235 --> 02:24:40.204
STAFFING ARE WE CHAT WILL BE DO

02:24:40.271 --> 02:24:42.206
OUR JOBS WERE SCENES BACK IN A

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:43.341
FEW RESPECT A SENSE OF YOU

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:45.309
COMING TO WORK READY TO WORK WE

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:48.880
HAVE WELL AT LEAST FIND. ANTI

02:24:48.946 --> 02:24:59.557
BEHIND OUR BACKS. UNFORTUNATELY

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:00.191
THE PERSON THAT WAS WITH STATE

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:01.125
IS LONGER. WORKING FOR THE- OF

02:25:01.192 --> 02:25:03.728
PUBLIC HEALTH THEY MOVED ON TO-

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:04.629
OTHER THINGS ACTUALLY WORKING

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:06.164
ON THE A CAR. SO WE NEED TO

02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:08.032
ABLE TO A MAKE TO TOLD THE SKY

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:11.135
OF EXPERTISE WITHIN OF HEALTH.

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:11.969
AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER REASON

02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:13.171
WHY WE ARE. FOR THIS ONGOING

02:25:13.237 --> 02:25:15.840
SUPPORT. WHAT IMPORTANCE. THAT

02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:17.675
THAT SHOULD BE TO THE OUR RICH

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.177
NOT JUST TO JUST WALK IN THE

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:20.745
BUT EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:23.548
ARE WATCHING ON A REGULAR BASIS.

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:26.451
HOW HOW HAS THE HOW HAS THE

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:29.320
PANDEMIC. IMPACTED YOUR BUDGET.

02:25:29.387 --> 02:25:31.355
AS IT RELATES TO STAFFING. I

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:33.458
KNOW I KNOW STAFF HAS BEEN A

02:25:33.524 --> 02:25:35.026
LOT OF OVERTIME STRESSED OUT

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:36.561
NOT HAVING AND ANOTHER STAFF

02:25:36.627 --> 02:25:38.229
WHICH IS WHAT I KEEP HEARING.

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:39.864
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:40.598
BRING IN TRAVELERS AND I'M

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:42.300
ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO. PAY A LOT

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:43.468
OF OVERTIME HOW HAS THAT

02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:46.270
IMPACTED YOUR BUDGETS AND YOUR

02:25:46.337 --> 02:25:49.941
ABILITY TO DELIVER CARE. VERY

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:51.576
SOON AGAIN I THINK FROM THE

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:52.510
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:54.545
STANDPOINT- THEIR HUSBAND

02:25:54.612 --> 02:25:56.147
INFUSION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:56.747
THAT HAVE COME THROUGH

02:25:56.814 --> 02:25:58.349
DIFFERENT- WHAT THEY CALL

02:25:58.416 --> 02:25:59.684
ENHANCE LABORATORY CAPACITY

02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:01.586
FUNDING. AND SO THAT IS ALLOWED

02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:03.988
US TO KIND OF RAMP UP SLOWLY-

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:06.757
ON DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND SO I

02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:07.625
WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THOSE

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.727
FUNDS EXPIRE THEY'RE NOT YOU

02:26:09.794 --> 02:26:11.562
KNOW A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:13.131
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS TYPICALLY

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:14.832
THERE IS. A DISEASE AND THEN

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:16.067
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS IN

02:26:16.134 --> 02:26:17.168
AND PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL

02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:18.336
FUNDING SO WE SAW THIS WITH

02:26:18.402 --> 02:26:20.471
EBOLA WE SAW THIS WITH ZECA.

02:26:20.538 --> 02:26:21.806
WE'RE SEEING THAT I THINK

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:22.773
THERE'S A TON OF OTHER EXAMPLES

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:23.808
THAT ARE COMING TO MIND BUT

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:25.009
THAT'S HOW WE'RE SEEING IT WITH

02:26:25.076 --> 02:26:27.778
THE PANDEMIC TO. AND SO YES

02:26:27.845 --> 02:26:29.080
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADD TO

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:30.281
THEIR STAFF AND I THINK IT

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:31.782
HELPS TO OFFSET SOME OF THE

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:33.084
ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT STAFF

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:35.186
BRING HER IN WITH OVERTIME AND-

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:36.687
THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THERE IS

02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:38.823
NO SOURCES TO CONTINUE THEM AND

02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:40.625
SO- THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL

02:26:40.691 --> 02:26:43.728
DOLLARS WE HAD JUST ASKED FOR

02:26:43.794 --> 02:26:44.262
ONE POINT TWO BILLION FOR

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:46.097
CONTACT TRACING- DISEASE

02:26:46.164 --> 02:26:47.798
INVESTIGATION VACCINES AND

02:26:47.865 --> 02:26:49.867
TESTING. SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE-

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:50.868
FUNDS WOULD BE USED TOWARDS

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:52.203
STAFFING COSTS AND SOME WILL BE

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:53.871
USED FOR EQUIPMENT AND OTHER.

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:55.773
NEED SECURITY AT A VACCINE SITE

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:58.042
FOR EXAMPLE AND WE REALLY

02:26:58.109 --> 02:26:59.810
APPRECIATE THAT THAT AND THE

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:00.678
JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:01.812
COMMITTEE APPROVED THOSE FUNDS

02:27:01.879 --> 02:27:02.747
IN THE PLAN THAT THE

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:04.615
ADMINISTRATION HAD. TO PROVIDE

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:05.550
US WITH THAT ONE POINT TWO

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:06.751
BILLION BUT I JUST WANT TO BE

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:08.252
VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S ONLY FOR

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:09.654
THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WORTH OF.

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:10.888
AND COST ESTIMATES ON THE LOCAL

02:27:10.955 --> 02:27:12.323
HEALTH DEPARTMENT SIDE AND AS

02:27:12.390 --> 02:27:14.091
WE CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:15.259
THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:16.928
ADDITIONAL AS YOU KNOW

02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:18.930
RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED. THAT'S

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:19.964
WHERE USING FEDERAL FUNDS TO

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:21.933
KIND TO HELP OFFSET THOSE THAT

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.601
INITIAL AND IMMEDIATE COST.

02:27:23.668 --> 02:27:25.436

IN LIGHT OF THE LAST PANEL THE

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:57.587
FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE IS IT

02:39:57.654 --> 02:39:58.188
ENOUGH AND IS IT GOING TO THE

02:39:58.255 --> 02:40:02.960
RIGHT PLACES. WELL I WOULD SAY

02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:06.163
THAT- THE MAIN DRIVE BEHIND HIS

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.497
PROPOSALS TO GIVE THE

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.833
LEGISLATURE THE BEST POSSIBLE

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:13.003

LOOK AT THE NEED ACROSS

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.242
DEPARTMENTS WE IDENTIFIED CLEAR

02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:22.479
AREAS OF RESOURCES THAT NEEDED

02:40:22.546 --> 02:40:23.814
TO. WE BOOKED THOSE SO THAT THE

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:26.783
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE THE

02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:28.418
ABILITY TO- REVIEW THOSE

02:40:28.485 --> 02:40:31.121
PROPOSALS OF PINE AND WORK

02:40:31.188 --> 02:40:32.789
COLLABORATIVELY ON ON THAT IS

02:40:32.856 --> 02:40:35.692
IT ENOUGH. WILK REMAINS TO BE

02:40:35.759 --> 02:40:37.127
SEEN WERE IN A HIGHLY FLUID

02:40:37.194 --> 02:40:38.628
SITUATION WHICH IS WHY WE'RE

02:40:38.695 --> 02:40:39.963
PROPOSING THE STAEWIDE

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:41.098
FLEXIBILITIES VIA CONTROL

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:44.001

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE

02:40:44.601 --> 02:40:47.137

POSSIBLE AND ENGAGE IN A IN A

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.275
TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS

02:40:52.342 --> 02:40:54.911
WHICH IS WHY WE- THERE ARE BASS

02:40:54.978 --> 02:40:56.313
TO ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:58.949
WITH THOSE WIDE RANGING- THAT-

02:40:59.016 --> 02:41:00.650
ASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THE

02:41:00.717 --> 02:41:03.086
STATE PASSED- SO I GUESS IT

QUESTION IS IT ENOUGH- IN TERMS

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:08.125
OF NO KNOWN AS WE'VE DONE OUR

02:41:08.191 --> 02:41:09.960
BEST TO ADD TO IDENTIFY THOSE

02:41:10.027 --> 02:41:11.795
IN TERMS OF UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS WE

HAVE AOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:15.599
THAT'S A SORT OF AVAILABLE FOR

02:41:15.665 --> 02:41:18.035
AB. ALLOCATION AND THEN ALSO TO

02:41:18.101 --> 02:41:22.172
THE CONTINUED. USE OF THE THREE

L. AT- ACCOUNT. FORTY IN THE IN

02:41:23.006 --> 02:41:25.976
CONCERT WITH THAT OVERALL. YOU

SITUATIONS- ONE EXPECTED COSTS

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:46.396
THAT- WE CAN'T PREDICT AT THIS

02:41:46.463 --> 02:41:49.032
TIME. SO- I'D SAY GENERALLY

02:41:49.099 --> 02:41:50.801

CONTINGENCIES SHOULD ADDITIONAL

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:56.807
NEEDS ARISE. AND I THINK

02:41:56.873 --> 02:41:59.376
THAT'S- THE INCIDENT THAT THAT

02:41:59.443 --> 02:42:00.911

NEW FUNDING COMES IN HOPEFULLY

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.282
THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THAT

02:42:05.348 --> 02:42:06.917
MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:09.953
TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THINGS.

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:10.554
THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE NOT

02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.222
COVERING. AND I GUESS I HAVE A

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:14.324
QUESTION ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

EVERY STEP BACKWARDS IS MONEY

02:42:19.029 --> 02:42:22.199
LOST SO THERE'S BEEN SOME.

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:23.934
ISSUES THAT WOULD ALL COME TO

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:24.534
LIGHT WAS THE MISSILE BLOWERS

02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:26.336
IN THE VALENCIA LABORATORY.

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:28.738
SOME IS IN SOME BAD DATA AND

02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:30.040
ANYTIME WE GET BAD DATA OR BAD

02:42:30.107 --> 02:42:32.242
TESTING IT DID AGAIN OUR ROADS

02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:34.211
FEAR HAS TO BUILD BACK UP. CAN

THEY'RE- GIVING US THEIR BEST

02:44:56.253 --> 02:44:56.886
GUESS BUT ALSO THE LOW OF

02:44:56.953 --> 02:44:59.122
CERTAINTY. AND SO I WANTED

OVERSIGHT SO I CERTAINLY

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:06.830
UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR. WHAT

LESS ABILITY BUT WHAT'S LIKELY

02:45:10.166 --> 02:45:11.868
HAVE TO COME ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:45:11.935 --> 02:45:12.702
AND I'LL BE SURE WE HAVE

02:45:12.769 --> 02:45:14.904
SUFFICIENT. MECHANISMS FOR

02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:17.574
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT AS THE

02:45:17.641 --> 02:45:19.242
MONEY IS BEING SPENT THAT WE

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:21.378

NOTED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS

02:45:34.624 --> 02:45:35.492
AND I THINK I MISTAKENLY

02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:37.193
REFERRED TO IT AS A ELEVEN

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.862
POINT NINE FIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY

02:45:38.928 --> 02:45:41.064
A PROPOSED CONTROL SECTION

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:42.666
ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. THAT

02:45:42.732 --> 02:45:44.000
DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY

02:45:44.067 --> 02:45:45.101
NOTIFICATION OF THE

02:45:45.168 --> 02:45:47.470
LEGISLATURE- IT WOULD ALLOW THE

02:45:47.537 --> 02:45:49.339
ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:50.674
DECREASE OR TRANSFER FUNDS

02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:52.409
BETWEEN SOME SPECIFIED

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:53.376
DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:54.744
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:56.746
WELL AS SPEND FEDERAL FUNDS.

02:45:56.813 --> 02:45:58.848
AND ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES NO

02:45:58.915 --> 02:46:00.884
INVOLVEMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE.

02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:02.218
THE SECOND CONTROL SECTIONAL

02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.787
LEVIN POINT NINE TWO WOULD

02:46:03.853 --> 02:46:07.724
EXTEND THE JURY- CELERITY-

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:10.126
THROUGH THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR

02:46:10.193 --> 02:46:12.796
AND AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY

02:46:12.862 --> 02:46:16.166
WELL AWARE- THE JURY- A PROCESS

02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:17.667
ONLY REQUIRES NOTIFICATION OF

02:46:17.734 --> 02:46:19.736
THE LEGISLATURE WHEN A TRANSFER

02:46:19.803 --> 02:46:21.471
IS MADE FROM THE SPECIAL FUND

02:46:21.538 --> 02:46:23.273
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES TO

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.642
THE JURY- SUB ACCOUNT. BUT THAT

02:46:25.709 --> 02:46:27.210
THE ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY

02:46:27.277 --> 02:46:30.547
NOT REQUIRED TO INFORM- THE

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:33.016
LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW THOSE

02:46:33.083 --> 02:46:35.285
FUNDS WILL BE FURTHER ALLOCATED

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:37.220
OR WHAT THE- WHICH WHICH-

02:46:37.287 --> 02:46:40.790
DEPARTMENTS- NECESSARILY. SO

02:46:40.857 --> 02:46:42.058
SIMPLE FOR BOTH PROPOSED

02:46:42.125 --> 02:46:44.728
CONTROL SECTIONS- DO YOU CAN DO

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:48.932
NOT INVOLVE- THE LEGISLATURE-

02:46:48.998 --> 02:46:50.433
EARLY TO ANY DEGREE ALL RIGHT

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:51.868
SO- LET'S GO BACK TO FINANCE

02:46:51.935 --> 02:46:54.104

02:46:54.170 --> 02:46:55.905
LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION HOW'S

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:59.976
THAT ACCEPTABLE- ELEVEN NINE

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:02.112
ONE. I'M NOT A PARTICULAR

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:05.348
PROPOSAL I WAS IN THE- PROCESS

02:47:05.415 --> 02:47:08.952
OF DRAFTING OKAY BUT- YOU KNOW

02:47:09.018 --> 02:47:11.454
ELEVEN NINE ONE NINE- IS A-

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:13.156
MORE INVOLVED CONTROL SECTION.

02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:14.624
BOB WHAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY

02:47:14.691 --> 02:47:18.194
ALLOW US TO DO IS MOVE THAT I

02:47:18.261 --> 02:47:20.430
GUESS THE ALLOW YOU TO DO BUT

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:21.765
WHAT ABOUT TELLING US WHAT'S

GOING ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE OR

02:47:24.434 --> 02:47:26.102
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. WILL

02:47:26.169 --> 02:47:27.504
THIS CASE BE I THINK THE BCG

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:28.705
OUTLINES THE FULL SCOPE OF

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:30.340
ACTIVITIES AND FUNDING FOR

02:47:30.407 --> 02:47:31.541
DEPARTMENT THAT WERE WERE

02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:34.210
LOOKING TO EXPAND- THE REAL

02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:36.045
PURPOSE OF THIS IS THERE ARE

02:47:36.112 --> 02:47:38.081
RESPONSIBILITIES OR- CHANGE

02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:39.282
BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS RENTS

02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:40.784
BETTER BETTER FIT FOR ANOTHER

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:44.154
PARTY TO DO SO- SO RIGHT I TELL

02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:45.955
THEM RIGHT AWAY. I REALIZE THAT

02:47:46.022 --> 02:47:47.123
YOU WERE YOURSELF WERE NOT

02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:48.858
PERSONALLY INVOLVED- BUT I

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:50.593
GUESS YOU'RE SINCE YOU'RE TO.

02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:54.664
REPRESENT. FROM FINANCE PERHAPS

02:47:54.731 --> 02:47:55.265
YOU CAN TELL YOUR- RUN IT UP

02:47:55.331 --> 02:47:56.900
THE CHAIN I THINK THE IDEA THAT

02:47:56.966 --> 02:47:57.634
THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE

02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:00.270
NOTIFICATION. OR IF THERE'S YOU

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:02.639
KNOW- SO I THINK WE NEED TO

02:48:02.705 --> 02:48:05.508
ADDRESS THAT- AND WHETHER DEBTS

02:48:05.575 --> 02:48:06.309
THE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

02:48:06.376 --> 02:48:08.044
BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND THEN AS I

02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:11.414
MENTIONED THE G. OLA APPROACH-

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:12.849
REALLY WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR

02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:14.651
THIS ON GOING SO I AGAIN YOU

02:48:14.717 --> 02:48:15.852
KNOW RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A-

02:48:15.919 --> 02:48:17.554
MERCHANT SEE WHERE WE Y. GIVES

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:19.222
FLEXIBILITY TO THE

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:21.291
ADMINISTRATION BILL RESPOND I

02:48:21.357 --> 02:48:23.460
GET THAT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE

02:48:23.526 --> 02:48:25.395
ROUTE YOU KNOW OUR- WE HAVE A

02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:27.063
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:29.065
AND MONITORING AND OF COURSE

02:48:29.132 --> 02:48:31.634
OUR FUNDAMENTAL- OUR TO

02:48:31.701 --> 02:48:34.571
APPROPRIATE. SO I HOPE THAT WE

02:48:34.637 --> 02:48:36.372
THERE'LL BE SOME REVISITING AT

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:38.007
THESE CONTROL SECTIONS IN A WAY

02:48:38.074 --> 02:48:40.276
THAT RECOGNIZES. AS A CO EQUAL

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:41.144
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE HAVE

02:48:41.211 --> 02:48:43.313
THIS- THE OVERSIGHT WE WANT TO

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:45.148
GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY THE

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:46.316
MINISTRATION OF LIES THAT YOU

02:48:46.382 --> 02:48:47.817
THE MINISTRATION OF FLEXIBILITY

02:48:47.884 --> 02:48:50.119
TO ADDRESS THIS PANDEMIC- BUT

02:48:50.186 --> 02:48:51.621
WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:52.622
THE OVERSIGHT AND I THINK YOU

02:48:52.689 --> 02:48:53.456
KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE LOW

02:48:53.523 --> 02:48:54.824
HINTS OF THINGS DROPPING OUT SO

02:48:54.891 --> 02:48:56.292
YOU MENTIONED THAT. WE HAVE THE

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:58.127
SINGLE USE CONTRACTS NOW I

02:48:58.194 --> 02:48:59.496
UNDERSTAND THAT IN AGAIN IN A

02:48:59.562 --> 02:49:01.698
CRISIS. PERHAPS NOT MUCH TIME

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:03.132
TO GO GET BIDS AND SO FORTH BUT

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:05.034
THEN WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT-

02:49:05.101 --> 02:49:07.003
THAT THE- CONTRACTING PROCESS

02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:08.938
IS BEING DONE AND A RESPONSIBLE

02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:11.174
WAY SO THAT. WE DON'T YOU KNOW

02:49:11.241 --> 02:49:12.976
SO THAT- WE THERE ARE ISSUES

02:49:13.042 --> 02:49:15.078
THAT POP UP BECAUSE A SINGLE

02:49:15.144 --> 02:49:16.212
SOURCE CONTRACTING IT CETERA

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.581
SO. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:22.485
HOPE WE CAN WORK OUT- PRIOR TO-

02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:25.321
BEFORE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET

02:49:25.388 --> 02:49:28.124
WHERE. OF YEAH WILL. IT WE NEED

02:49:28.191 --> 02:49:30.193
TO BE SHARP AT THE PUMP CAST.

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:31.561
RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:49:31.628 --> 02:49:32.228
THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

02:49:32.295 --> 02:49:34.497
AND THAT'S ALSO WHY WE HEARTHE

02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:35.231
LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE SURE

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:37.600
THAT WE HAVE. INFORMATION AND

02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:38.067
THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:40.470
NOTIFICATION- THAT CREATES A

02:49:40.537 --> 02:49:41.471
PROBLEM BECAUSE OF SOMETHING

02:49:41.538 --> 02:49:43.373
DIDN'T GO TO GO RIGHT WELL IT'S

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.275
BEEN ENTIRELY AND THAT THE

02:49:45.341 --> 02:49:47.377

WANT ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY

02:49:52.749 --> 02:49:56.419

TRY AND UP EVERYTHING SO. I

02:50:37.026 --> 02:50:38.161
FEELING WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE

02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:39.829
DOING QUITE A BIT OF TESTING

02:50:39.896 --> 02:50:41.030
EVEN ONCE WE GET PEOPLE

WE DON'T HAVE L. BREAKS AND IN

02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:47.303
PARTICULAR AREAS AND SO WHETHER

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:48.037
THAT CAN BE HANDLED BY THE

02:50:48.104 --> 02:50:50.039
EXISTING SMELL TESTING SYSTEM

02:50:50.106 --> 02:50:51.341

THAT PART THE REASON FOR THE

02:50:55.745 --> 02:50:58.748
LABORATORY. WAS ALSO BECAUSE-

02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:00.817
IT IT HELPED DRIVE PUSH PRICES

02:51:00.883 --> 02:51:02.986
DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:03.853
WHAT HAPPENED IS WE HAD A
