READINESS AND CAREER EXPLORATION BOTH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO MEET THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEMANDS. SCHOOLS MUST PREPARE ALL STUDENTS FOR A WORLD BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO A TWO. TWO OR FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR TO A TRADE SCHOOL OR IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE WORKFORCE. CG PROGRAMS MUST CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY FOR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND WE AS A STATE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD ON THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE ALREADY MADE IN THESE PROGRAMS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. AND AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I SAW MANY KIDS FALL OFF THE PATH OF HIGH SCHOOL SUCCESS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR THEM IS THERE AT SCHOOL. EVERY TOLD THEY'RE GONNA GO TO A FOR UNIVERSITY AND THAT THAT WAS THE MEASURE OF THE SIX SIGMA. SUCCESS THAT HE DIDN'T DO THAT WELL. WELL THEN WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO WAS VALUABLE AND THAT IS- UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK WE'RE SEEKING TO REVERSE. THAT THAT PARADIGM IF YOU WILL AND WE'VE DONE SOME GOOD WORK OVER THE LAST. FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS WE THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE. TWO YEARS AGO- ONGOING FUNNY RISK FOR K. TWELVE CTV WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PROGRAMS. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON EACH SIDE EACH GRANT PROGRAM- ADMINISTER THIS CD AND THEN THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BY THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AND ESTHER. THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGES HI SHARED MUCH CONST. THAT WAS CREE BECAUSE I ALWAYS CALL. IT SHOULD BE A CD I. STILL STRUGGLE WITH WHY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD. ADMINISTER K. TWELVE MONEY. BUT THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE MAY HAVE AGAIN. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES OF. THOSE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE GRANT MONEY. AS WELL AS FROM LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS ABOUT HOW THE TWO INITIATIVES ARE SERVING THE NEEDS. OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN ACCESSING HIGH QUALITY. CTP PROGRAMS- SO WITH THAT- I DON'T SEE ANY MY COLLEAGUES IN AGAIN THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING IN AND OUT. I ONE THINK DEBBIE LOOK. HARD I'M PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL FROM FAR AND NEAR. SOMETIMES TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING- I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE PANEL ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHAT'S THE THREE PANELS TODAY. RIGHT THREE PANELS. AND WE'LL START WITH PANEL ONE- PANEL ONE IS GOING TO FOCUS ON- AN OVERVIEW- KEY A TWELVE. PROGRAMS AND IF THEY COME UP THERE IS A AND- NEIL- RESIN COUGH. NO TO ADD RESIDENT FOR LEGISLATIVE ANNA OFFICE I CHANGING NAME. YOUR OR YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL MAD AND THE- TO. LUPITA ALCALA CHIEF DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT. KILEY JACKSON IN CHI JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT. OF EQUITY AND ACCESS BRANCH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT YOU GET YOUR FROM C. H. ET AS SANDERS CENTERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE MR OAKLEY'S OFFICE WITH THAT COME FORWARD PLEASE ALL OF YOU NOW AND OUR FIRST WILL BE- NED I THANK YOU AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. AT THE- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO BE- PROVIDING JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF-THE HIGH SCHOOL C. T. E. LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA I'LL BE READING OUT OF A HAND OUT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTING OUT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON. JUST THE STARTING ON PAGE ONE JUST A BRIEF REMINDER OF. HOW HIGH SCHOOL CT IS ORGANIZED IN THE STATE- IT'S DIVIDED INTO- FIFTEEN INDUSTRY SECTORS AND- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION HAS DEVELOPED CURRICULUM STANDARDS FOR EACH OF THOSE SECTORS- I WILL WALK THROUGH ALL OF THE- SECTORS RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S A- FAIRLY BROAD RANGE- EVERYTHING FROM FASHION AND INTERIOR DESIGN TO YOU AGRICULTURE TO MANUFACTURING AND HEALTH SCIENCE IT. PAGE TWO GOES OVER THE- C. T. E. OBJECTIVES- IF YOU VISITED A CT EACH CLASSROOM OR OR FACILITY IN IN YOUR DISTRICT YOU KNOW THAT IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A TRADITIONAL K. TWELVE CLASSROOM BUT THE OBJECTIVES ARE ARE BROADLY SPEAKING VERY SIMILAR TO- THE OBJECTIVES OF ANY OTHER AT K. TWELVE PROGRAM- THERE TO PROMOTE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT- TEACHING ACADEMIC SUBJECTS IN A IN A HANDS ON WAY- TEACHING TECHNICAL SKILLS IN PARTICULAR TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT COULD LEAD TO- COLLEGE OR- FULL TIME JOB- TEACHING SOFT SKILLS SUCH AS- TEAM BUILDING OR OR LEADERSHIP THAT AGAIN COULD BE USEFUL IN EITHER A- POST SECONDARY SETTING OR OR-FULL TIME CAREER. AND HELPING THE STATE NEEDED SO WORK FOR SCHOOLS BY TRAINING- MORE IT. YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO SKILLED- CAREERS THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEMAND FOR IN THE STATE. I'M JUST GONNA WALK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE- RECENT HISTORY. OF CTP FUNDING IN THE STATE SO- PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN- C. T. E. WAS FUNDED PRIMARILY THROUGH A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THE LARGEST OF WHICH- WAS R. O. C. P. OR THE- REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTER IS AND PROGRAMS- AT ITS HEIGHT. THAT WIND CASA STATE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. BUT THEN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEY'LL SEE IF THAT AND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN A LOT OF THOSE CATEGORICAL AS WERE FOLDED INTO THE BASE GRANT- INCLUDING R. O. C. P. AND IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT C. D. E. PROGRAMS OFTEN OCCUR- HIGHER COSTS THAN OTHER TYPES OF- K. TWELVE INSTRUCTION. THERE WAS A TWO POINT 6% AUGMENTATION TO THE BASE GRANT FOR STUDENTS IN GRADES NINE THROUGH TWELVE. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT WITH THE- GREATER FLEXIBILITY OF LCF HAVE SOME DISTRICTS MIGHT SHUT DOWN THEIR C. D. E. PROGRAMS. THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT- DISTRICTS SPEND NO LESS ON ROC PIECE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF L. C. F. F. AND THEY HAD A AND THE YEAR PRIOR TELL CASF IN IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE STATE ESTABLISHED A NEW CATEGORICAL PROGRAM THAT WAS TO RUN FOR THREE YEARS. CALLED THE- CAREER- TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT OR OR SEATED. AND AT THAT ONE- FUNDED- COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ANOTHER ALLEY ETS. TO FUND THEIR C. T. E. PROGRAMS- FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS- BEGINNING IN A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHEN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WAS ADVOCATES- ALLOCATED FOR THE PROGRAM IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THREE HUNDRED MILLION WAS ALLOCATED. AND THEN IN- SAYS- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND AS AS THE GRANT SCALED DOWN THERE WAS ALSO A CHANGE IN HOW MUCH THE- GRANT T. WAS SUPPOSED TO MATCH THOSE FUNDS. SO INITIALLY IT WAS A- ONE TO ONE MATCH- IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN- ELLIE IS WERE ASKED TO- CONTRIBUTE ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR STATE FUNDS AND THEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT WAS A TWO TO ONE MATCH. AND THEN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SEATED WAS CONVERTED INTO AN ONGOING PROGRAM WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ON GOING FUNDS. KEPT AT A TWO TO ONE MATCH- AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE ALSO CREATED THE- HIGH SCHOOL STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM ANOTHER ON GOING PROGRAM- HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. ALSO A TWO TO ONE MATCH. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT- SEE TAKE WAS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHEREAS THE HIGH SCHOOL STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ALSO WHERE AS A C. TAKE PROVIDES COMPETITIVE GRANTS DIRECTLY TO ELLIE ETS- ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SIDE. THERE IS A GROUP OF- REGIONAL STRONG WORK FIRST CAN SHORT CONSORTIA- OVER ALL THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE AND- THEY RECEIVE FUNDS- ON A- BASED ON A FORMULA. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ATTENDANCE AND REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS- IT THEN- THOSE CONSORTIA AWARD THE GRANTS ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO ELLIE A IS. JUST A TACO A LITTLE BRIEFLY ABOUT C. T. ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER LC FF. AGAIN SIMILAR TO HOW THE OBJECTIVES OF C. T. E. ARE BROADLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OTHER K. TWELVE PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO LOOKS BROADLY THE SAME- THE PRIMARY INDICATOR THAT'S USED TO EVALUATE C. T. E. IS THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR WHICH IS- ALSO PART OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD- AND SCHOOL DISTRICT- CAPS- REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR CTP PROGRAMS LOOK LIKE OR WHETHER THEY HAVE CTP PROGRAMS. AND THE FINAL PAGE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HAND OUT. GOES INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE- COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR LOOKS LIKE- FOR NOW I'LL JUST SAY. THAT ALTHOUGH THE STATE HAS MADE SOME RECENT IMPROVEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO- COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS THERE'S STILL SOME WEIGHT GOOD TO GO. SO IN- AT TWENTY NINETEEN THE GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY NINETEEN. 44% OF THOSE STUDENTS WERE DEEMED PREPARED FOR COLLEGE WHICH WAS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT OVER 40% IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT 39% IN TWENTY NINETEEN WERE STILL CONSIDERED NOT PREPARED. FOR THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME'S KIND JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE CHIEF DEPUTY. LUPITA ALCALA- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE'RE HERE WITH- OTHER STAFF FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORT- FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR CONTINUED IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF FOR THE INVESTMENTS THROUGH C. T. AND THE VARIOUS- FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH CTP. THAT SUPPORT K. TWELVE AND PARTICULARLY CONVERTING C. T. E. INVESTMENT GRANTS INTO AN ONGOING PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS A CD AND SEND OF GRANT. PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES THE SPECIALIZED SECONDARY PROGRAM AND THE FEDERAL CARL CARL PERKINS FUNDS ALL PROVIDING SUPPORT TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT C. T. E. IS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. CT IS A VITAL- FOR PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW IN CAN BE A CRITICAL TOOL. TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND AS YOU ARE AWARE EDUCATION RESOURCE RESEARCH SHOWS HOW TECHNICAL SKILLS BUILDING AND WORK EXPERIENCES IMPROVE ACADEMIC UNDERSTANDING AND ACHIEVEMENT. CG PROVIDESA PATHWAY TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CAREERS. AND IT IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAT BECOMES THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION FOR THE REAL WORLD C. T. E. AS A AS A PERSPECTIVE C. G. E. SERVES NEARLY ONE MILLION STUDENTS AND NINE THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE WHICH IS JUST OVER HALF OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AT THAT OUR ROLE IN CT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS PERCENTAGE HAS INCREASED ROUGHLY FROM 40% IN TWO THOUSAND AND 10250% TODAY. AND CTP IS A STRATEGY IT'S A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE EQUITY AND ACCESS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY AND TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT EXPERIMENTAL LEARNING TO STUDENTS IN ORDER TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE WORK FORCE. CT IS CENTRAL TO STUDENT LEARNING AND SUCCESS AND IS MEASURED BY COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. GOOD AFTERNOON LOU BE TACKLE THIS ALKALINE HALF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND- HONORABLE CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I WANT TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE C. T. E. INNOVATION GRANT WE ADMINISTER VERY PROUD TO ADMINISTER. IT'S A COMPETITIVE GRANT THAT HAS DECREASED OVER TIME AS OUR COLLEAGUE HAS- ALREADY MENTIONED FROM THE LA YOU KNOW FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY ELLIE ETS ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY. AND THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHILE THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS HAD REMAINED STEADY. HOWEVER THE FUNDING AMOUNT REQUESTED BY THE ELOISE HAS INCREASED FROM THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWO NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY SO THAT'S A DEMAND OF AN INCREASE OF 3100% FOR THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THIS GRANT WAS ALSO REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST PROVIDE A TWO TO ONE MATCH. AND IN STATUTES ACTUALLY REQUIRES THE DISTRIBUTION BY EIGHTY EIGHT CATEGORIES SO THE SMALLS INCLUDE ELEAZAR OF LESS OR EQUAL TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY STUDENTS. MEDIUMS IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND LARGES IS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND BEYOND TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. THE THREE STANDARDS WERE SET TO EVALUATE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE- HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS FIRST AND FOREMOST- SELF EVALUATION AND THEN THE REVIEWER SCORES. EVALUATION OF THE APPLICATION NARRATIVE INCLUDING BUDGET NARRATIVE AND THREE YEAR BUDGET PLAN NOW OF COURSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS GRANT WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE ELLIE ETS LOCAL CONTROL- ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS- STREAMLINING AND IT HERE AND THERE. BUT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE DETERMINATION WAS MADE TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS IN FIVE DISTRIBUTION CATEGORIES RATHER THAN THREE DISTRIBUTION CATEGORIES WHICH WERE USED IN ALL PRIOR YEARS. IF WE WOULD HAVE USED THE PRIOR FORMULA WITH THE THREE CATEGORIES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVENTEEN MILLION LEFTOVER. INSTEAD IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT WAS DECIDED TO USE THE FIVE CATEGORIES TO ENSURE THAT THE SEVENTEEN MILLION WAS FULLY UTILIZED. THIS ADJUSTMENT RESULTED IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF FUNDS FOR DISTRICTS WITHIN THE 500-518-8211 HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WE BELIEVE THE THREE FUNDING CATEGORIES IN STATUTE THE SMALL MEDIUM LARGE USE IN ALL OTHER YEARS EXCEPT THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THAT'S PROVIDED IN STATUTE PROVIDES THE MOST EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION FOR THESE FUNDS AT THIS TIME. FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTES CD HAS WORKED TO ALLOCATE THE C. T. E. INNOVATION GRANT IN THE MOST EQUITABLE WAY. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ELEAZAR WHICH EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL AVAILABLE FUNDS REMEMBER WE HAVE A NINE HUNDRED MILLION REQUESTS FOR THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. BUT THE ALLOCATION EIGHTEEN WE TRULY THOUGHT WE WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR ELLIE ACE WE TRULY WANT TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS IN GREATER WAYS TO BE A C. D. PROGRAMS AND OFFERINGS. BY DOING SO WITH GREAT INTENTIONS WE CREATED AN ANOMALY. WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMANDS OF OUR ALLEY ACE MOVING FORWARD WE WILL ENSURE THAT ELEAZAR FULLY INFORMED ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA METHODOLOGY FOR NINETEEN TWENTY. AND BEYOND THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ELLIE ENGAGEMENT VIA EMAIL WEBINARS ANOTHER COMMUNICATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING THE CTP. INNOVATION GRANT VERY SERIOUSLY WE WILL WORK TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY. HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE CD OFFERINGS TO OUR STUDENTS IS OUR PRIORITY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UTILIZE ALL RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT WE CAN MAKE TO IMPROVE THE POSTSECONDARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING THE C. TAKE OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF K. TWELVE CT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NEXT. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON- HONORABLE CHAIRED MEMBERS- MY NAME IS SANDERS SANCHEZ AND I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR A WORK FORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CANCERS OFFICE- TODAY WHEN I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU AN UPDATE OF OUR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. AND I'M GOING TO DO. DO THE SLIDE SHOW FOR YOU IT'S IMPORTANT TO- QUICKLY REVIEW THE INTENT OF K. TWELVE FROM WORK FIRST PROGRAM FOR THOSE OF- FOLKS WHO MAY BE NEW TO THIS WORK THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO SUPPORT COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE K. TWELVE SECTOR AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES INDUSTRY BUSINESS AND BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO STRENGTHEN CT PROGRAMS AND PATHWAYS AS WELL AS SUPPORT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING HIGH QUALITY K. FOURTEEN CT COURSE SEQUENCING PROGRAMS AND PATHWAYS AND AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVE IS FUELED IN PART BY THE STRENGTH OF ITS REGIONAL ECONOMIES. AND IT SKILLED WORKFORCE SUPPORTING K. FOURTEEN PATHWAYS DEMONSTRATES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A SKILLED WORKFORCE TO MEET THE STATE'S LABOR MARKET NEEDS AND TO ENSURE UPWARD SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CHANCE SERVICE OFFICE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED RECOGNIZE THAT FOR THIS EFFORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IT MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF EACH REGION. AND MUST ENGAGE THE EFFORTS OF K. TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STAKEHOLDERS. TO THIS END THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM SUPPORT CTP PROGRAMS. AND PATHWAYS THAT LEVERAGE CITY AT E. EFFORTS INCLUDING THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT. PERKINS FIVE AND STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM. THAT FOSTER COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT A LINE TO REGIONAL PRIORITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND OFFER PATHWAYS WITH HIGH QUALITY CT CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION. THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM COMPLEMENTS THE WORK OF THE SEATED THAT'S EXPANDING THE IDENTIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS THAT EMBRACE THESE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATION OF SUCCESSFUL CT PROGRAMS. AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM IS ENGAGING IN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. SINCE THE LAST ROUND OF FUNDING WE'VE COLLECTED DATA AND FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE LOW BLOOD GRANT MAKING PROCESS BOTH FORMALLY THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS AND INFORMALLY THROUGH DISCUSSIONS. AS A RESULT WE MADE SEVERAL CHANGES FOR YEAR TWO FUNDS AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TIMELINE THE KATE TWELVE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM YOUR TO PROCESS IS WELL UNDER WAY. APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING REVIEWED AND AWARDS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN LATE FEBRUARY. SO I TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE REVIEW AN AWARD PROCESS. THE PROCESS RELIES ON THE INPUT AND EXPERTISE OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS FROM TEACHERS TO BUSINESS LEADERS WITH. EACH WITH A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THEIR PARTICULAR REGION. K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE APPLICATIONS ARE RED AND SCORED BY SELECTION COMMITTEE TEAMS COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EXPERTISE. IN K. TWELVE CT OR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS CHARTER SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVES. CAREER GUIDANCE COUNSELORS INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES IN THE REGION'S PRIORITY AREAS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. SELECTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN A RIGOROUS ANDCOLLABORATIVE TRAINING PROCESS USING STANDARD MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS TO ENSURE EQUITABLE AND CONSISTENT SCORING. AND A LINE TO THE INTENT OF THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM. THIS YEAR THERE ARE EIGHT REGIONAL SELECTION COMMITTEE TEAMS. BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS PER REGION FOR TOTAL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ACROSS THE STATE. HERE ON THIS SIDE YOU'LL SEE A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF YOUR ONE INTO. SINCE ELECTION COMMITTEES ARE STILL IN THE SCORING PROCESS SOME OF THE DATA IS FOR PRELIMINARY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING MORE COMPLETE DATA WITH YOU ONCE A WORK. FOR YOU YOU ARE MADE FOR YEAR TWO THREE HUNDRED AND TWO APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED AND SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR THE GRANT FUNDS REQUESTED ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION EXCEED THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ALLOCATION. ONCE AWARDED- WE HAVE- ESTABLISHED ACCESS TO A TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. AND THESE INCLUDE THE K. FOURTEEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE K. TWELVE PATHWAY COORDINATORS. WHO WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE SEA TAKES. SO TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE PATHWAY OF COORDINATORS ALL START WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS N THE GROUND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE ORTIZ. WE'VE DESIGNATED SEVENTY TWO PATHWAY COORDINATES ONE PER EACH OF THE SEVENTY TWO CALIFORNIA COMMUTE COLLEGE DISTRICTS THESE PROFESSIONALS WILL BRING WITH THEM EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE ON EDUCATION CAREER PATHWAYS AND OR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS A RANGE OF FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE. THEIR ROLE IS TO SUPPORT LINK A LINE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FUNDED BY SEE TAKE STRONG WORK FORCE AND Sí GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE WILL HAVE A DEEP KNOWLEDGE- OF EXISTING CITY PATHWAYS THE PROGRAMS. ELEVEN EXISTING SEATED COORDINATORS WILL TO OR TRANSITION INTO THIS ROLE REGIONS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING BETTING HIRING THE REMAINING SIXTY ONE INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL SERVE IN THIS ROLE. WE ANTICIPATED THAT ALL SEVENTY TWO PATHWAY CORNERS WILL BE IN PLACE BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR. SINCE THE K. TWELVE AND COMMIT COLLEGE APPROACH CAREER PATHWAYS DIFFERENTLY. OF AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING SESSION FOR ALL PATHWAY COORDINATORS IS SCHEDULED FOR THIS JUNE. ON A TWO AND A HALF DAY SESSION WILL FOCUS ON NORMING KNOWLEDGE- NORMING AND KNOWLEDGE BUILDING WHICH ARE KEY TO AN EFFECTIVE AND ALIGNED. SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE THE SECOND PART OF OURS- SUPPORT IS THE K. FOURTEEN- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. THERE ARE EIGHT- PROFESSIONALS IN THIS ROLE ONE FOR EACH REGION TO PROVIDE REGIONAL LEADERSHIP IN THE DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION. AND ORGANIZATION OF PATHWAY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. THE IDENTIFICATION VETTING AND HIRING OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS ALSO CURRENTLY UNDER WAY AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ALL EIGHT. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS IN PLACE. BY LATE MARCH EARLY APRIL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS WILL ALSO BE PARTICIPATING IN THAT JUNE ONBOARDING TRAINING THAT WE HAVE SCHEDULED. FINALLY WE ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH CD E. WE HAVE REGULAR JOINT PLANNING MEETINGS WHERE WE DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE AND RELATED PROJECTS. EARLIER THIS MONTH WE MET TO DISCUSS THE COORDINATION OF C. TAKE AND KATE- TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE AWARDS CYCLES. AND ALSO ON GOING TECHNICAL SYSTEM- SUPPORT FOR BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING TOGETHER TO MINIMIZE THE WORKLOAD IMPACT TO THE FIELD WE ARE ALSO WORKING THROUGH THE ALIGNMENT OF OUR DATA DEFINITIONS EARLIER THIS WEEK THE CHANCES OFFICE AND CD MATT. AND WE WILL AGAIN MEET IN THE NEXT MONTH TO FINALIZE OUR DATA ELEMENT DICTIONARY THAT WILL DEFINE THE SCOPE OF WORK FOR BUILDING OUT THE DATA LAUNCH BOARD FOR THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU I JUST COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE FOR THE AUDIO WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT REQUESTED. A BY BOTH SIDES THE PROGRAM DO YOU KNOW. YES SO- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE TOTAL MORE ABOUT REQUESTED FOR SEATED WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN- FOR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. SO A LOT MORE THAN WE HAD AVAILABLE FOR SURE. YES OKAY AND- FOR THE CITY HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT APPLICATIONS IN THE INCENTIVE GRANT WILL BE. ABLE TO COUNT ON A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF FUNDING- IN THE FUTURE. WELL WE WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND IT HERE TO ME STATUTORY INTERPRETATION OF- THE FUNDING FORMULA ALLOCATIONS SO WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR- SCORING RUBRIC TO IT HERE TO THE- SELF EVALUATION LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT THE SCORES REVIEW AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THAT HERE IS TO EL CAP MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A- THREE YEAR- BUDGET PLAN IN PLACE SO- IF THERE IS A DESIRE BY THE COMMITTEE OR- OTHERS TO REVISIT THAT FORMULA WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON. HOW THEY COULD BE IMPROVED. SO MAYBE MAYBE FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PERSPECTIVE WHAT YOU SEE IS THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR TWO PROGRAMS WE'VE GOT A HIGHER FIFTY MILLION ADMINISTERED BY A CD EVE GOT A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT HE SEES THAT THE KEY DIFFERENCES. IN MISSION. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. SO MUCH AS A- WILLINGNESS TO A LINE- SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PATHWAYS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUUM FROM. THE K. TWELVE TO COLLEGE. TO ANY OTHER HIGHER INSTITUTION OR TO WORK. AND SO- IT'S REALLY- FOR US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY- AND WORK WITH OUR QUE TOLL PARTNERS WHO HAVE C. T. PROGRAMS AND ALLIED KNOWS BETTER TO ME WORKFORCE DEMANDS IN OUR REGION. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S- SO MUCH A DIFFERENCE I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE IN OUR TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AS SOCIAL ECONOMIC- MOBILITY- OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS- AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A LINE OUR EFFORTS TO BETTER SERVE STUDENTS AND HELP THEM CONTINUE ON THAT JOURNEY. THANK YOU. AT LEAST ONE QUESTION THE POPS IN MY HEAD WHEN. THE DAY ARE TO. TWO I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A DUPLICATION OF EFFORT BUT THAT'S NOT I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT UNLESS YOU TO DESIRE TO. BUT I JUST DID WHY DO WE DO TWO THINGS. MUNIFICENT WHAT GOAL. IT IS NOT HE'S DOING THE SAME THING. I THINK THAT- I THINK ME COLLEGE LEVEL ARE KERR TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON. JOB TRAINING THAT REQUIRES POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LINING A PATHWAY. IF THEY STARTED THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO. AND THE FOR WORKING TOGETHER IT'S A SEAMLESS TRANSITION AS OPPOSED TO NOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO DOES THIS TO- SO. IT'S NOT DOING THE SAME THING. IT'S IMPROVING THE OUTCOMES AND HOPEFULLY MOVING STUDENTS THROUGH THEIR JOURNEY. IN A MORE SEAMLESS WAY. CAN I JUST. AS A PARENT TEACHER I JUST TO GIVE SOMETIME CITY IS AND ALWAYS. YOU KNOW. I THINK WE'VE GOT A FORM GOVERNOR WHO. WANT STUDENTS TO PICK PATH IN SEVENTH GRADE. RIGHT AND- I'M NOT THERE HEY AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE THERE. I THINK CT PROGRAM SHOULD NOT ONLY BE TO EDUCATE STUDENTS. CERTAINLY YEAH IT MAYBE. HELP THEM CHOOSE A CREW BUT ALSO ENGAGES KIDS KEEP SEVEN SCHOOL SO I THINK WE NEED TO. KEEP THAT IN MIND TO IN THE IN THE SKILLS YOU LEARN. IN A C. T. PROGRAM BE THEY YOU KNOW MIDDLE SCHOOL ON UP. YOU CAN THEN USE LATER ON IN LIFE. I MEAN I. DIDN'T DO WELL OF MY FRACTIONS UNTIL SOMEONE HANDED ME A PIECE OF WOOD AND SAID CUT THAT A FIVE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS. RIGHT THAT'S WHEN I REALLY LEARNED THAT'S WHEN I AND I COULD APPLY IT LATER ON IN LIFE- I JUST THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO BE MINDFUL OF IT ON THE WE SHOULD GET TOO CAUGHT I'M NOT SAYING YOUR- WE SHOULD GET TOO CAUGHT pPROGRAMS HAVE TO BE ALIGNED WITH HIGH SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF HIGH SCHOOL MY NOT EVEN OFFER. A CERTAIN TYPE OF PROGRAM CORRECT. HE WON'T COMMENT ON THAT OR NOT. YES I THINK IT GOES BOTH WAYS I THINK THERE ARE- HIGH SCHOOL. AS THEY DON'T OFFER. A ROBUST- PROGRAMS. AT INCREASE TECHNICAL AGES AS WELL AS THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT DON'T AND I THINK THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND BETTER ALIGNMENT FOR THAT. FOR THAT. SPECIFIC REASON THAT. IN SOME CASES THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GET IT AT. AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL THEY GET AT THE COMMUNITY% COLLEGE LEVEL. OR THERE. WILL HAVE IT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY CONTINUE THEIR PATHWAY- AND IT MAY NOT BE WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE- BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD JOB. OF ALIGNING. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS. THIS IS HELPFUL TO THAT EFFORT. ONE OF THE KEEP. WE'VE SEEN IT'S REALLY NOT A DIFFERENCE IS MAYBE I WOULD MEET MEANT ADMINISTER BUT MOST. IN NINETEEN NINETY WE HAD THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUESTS FOR THE ONE FIFTY. THIS YEAR IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVE NINE HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLAR REQUEST. ARE PRO SAME AMOUNT OF APPLICANTS. SO THEY WANT TO GROW THEIR PROGRAMS CORRECT EITHER KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THEY WERE USED TO PRO GETTING PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SO I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S ON THAT'S HAPPENING IN IT WILL KERR BUT- THAT IS ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE- THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I JUST HAVEN'T. BENEFITTED FROM FROM THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THAT NEED BUT THERE'S A HUGE DESIRE TO GROW CITY PROGRAMS. AND A HUGE DESIRE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S FOR C. T. TO BE VIABLE VITAL GROW IT'S HUGE FOR THE JOBS. YOU KNOW FOR BUILDING OUR ECONOMY. I JUST WANT YOU KNOW JUST THOUGHT THE POPS IN MY HEAD AS YOU COMMON THAT WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BACK HERE BEFORE. SEE HE CAN BE COLLEGE PREP BUT C. T. ISN'T COLLEGE PREP RIGHT. IT MIGHT MEANING THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE COLLEGE PREP. PREPPER GRAMS LABEL MCT. USE THAT MONEY AND WHEN THEY'RE REALLY. YOU KNOW. NOT A C. T. MISSION. OUR CLASS SAM. AND I DON'T KNOW MINISTRY GALLAGHER YOU WISH TO. HEAR I THINK YOU HAVE SOME SPECIFIC TERMS. IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT WERE KIND OF THE TOUR SO I KIND OF LET U. S. QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN A AGAIN EVERY YOU ME TO JOIN THE CA THIS MORNING FOR THIS. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OF CB IN SOMETHING THAT IS CLOSE TO MY HEART I'M A PRODUCT OF IT MYSELF- SO. YOU KNOW TO THE DEPUTY. SEC SUPERINTENDENT I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD SO MY CONCERNS AND WE WHEN WE WROTE A LETTER BUT OBVIOUSLY AND HOW THIS HOW THIS ALLOCATION IS BEING DONE AT LEAST PROPOSE FOR THIS YEAR HAS SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ESPECIALLY ON WHAT I GUESS WHAT WE LABEL SMALL LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEO SO FOR EXAMPLE IN. AND MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS I'M NAING HAVE SOME VERY. LONG LONG TERM EFFECTIVE C. T. PROGRAMS- BUT LIKE COLUSA UNIFIED. YOU KNOW THERE SEEN A LOSS OF TWO NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 83% DECREASE. UNDER THIS PROPOSED- ALLOCATION AROUND FIVE- CORNING. YEAH UNION HIGH SCHOOL NINETY TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A HIGH SCHOOL. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN NINETY NINE A 76% DECREASE LIVE OAK UNIFIED. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX. DOLLARS A 75% DECREASE AN EMMY AND THESE ARE NOT. LARGE SCHOOLS- BUT THEY FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY IN THE WAY THAT THIS IS GAME ALLOCATED BUT THEY DO AL EVERY ONE OF THOSE DOLLARS MATTERS- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ARE PRETTY YOU KNOW AND I THINK THE IDEA IS SAY WE WANT TO. THIS TO PROVE IN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SHOWN EFFECTIVENESS AND- AND WE'VE SEEN THIS IN IN AND ALL THESE ONES THAT I'VE NAMED. AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT FUNDING FORMULA. NOW BEEN APPROVED AT THE NEXT BOARD MEETING- SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE COULD WE PUT IN FRONT OF THE BOARD. IN THE DIFFERENT HOW THAT DIFFERENCE JOIN THE TWO WAYS TO ALLOCATE AND WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE I THINK THE BOARD SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THIS COULD MEAN TO EFFECTIVE- CT PROGRAMS IN THE STATE IF WE GO FORWARD GOOD. THANK YOU FOR ASKING A QUESTION. EDIBLE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NAY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SOME OF THESE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS- BETWEEN A 100% ME THERE'S A HUGE INCREASES WHICH WERE REALLY AN ANOMALY BECAUSE IN PRIOR YEARS BY USING THE VERY FORMULA THEY WERE RECEIVING OBVIOUSLY LESS THAT AMOUNT SO IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CLEARLY. I WAS HEARING WHICH THEY GOT SAW A BOOST THEY BENEFITTED FROM THAT- AND IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVEDECIDED TO GO BACK TO AND HEARING THE STATUTE WE AGREE WITH YOU- WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND LEGISLATURE ON. AMENDING OR AT THE CURRENT FORMULA IN STATUTE TO ENSURE THAT- THE ALLOCATION OF THIS FORMULA IS MORE EQUITABLE BY EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE PROVIDING A BOOST PERHAPS TO THE SMALLER AND SMALLER MEDIUM SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT THEY HAVE A VIABLE VIABLE PROGRAM WE ABSOLUTELY SERVE AGREE WITH YOU THE MATCH IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE TWO TO ONE MATCH- IT'S- RIGHT NOW IT'S FOR ALL THREE- COHORTS OF. OF SIZES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE SAME MATCH AND THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM I'M SURE TO HEAR ABOUT IT TODAY I'M SO WE'RE HAPPY TALK TO YOU AND WE'RE ALL PROVIDE THE STATE BOARD WITH THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN THE PRIOR YEARS AND WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE IT IS- SO THAT THEY HAVE FULL INFORMATION. WE ABSOLUTELY WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT OKAY JUST ABOUT JUST SOME DATA RUNS THAT SHOW THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND HOW THAT GETS COMPLETED. AND. I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION IS RIGHT NOW HOW DO WE- HOW TO SEE THE DEFINE RURAL FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THE PURPOSES OF POSITIVE- CONSIDERATION IN THE STATUTE. WELL GREENS STAND TO- IT'S DEFINED FOR US- AND I'VE WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS ADMINISTRATION WASN'T HERE WHEN THAT PLACE AND MAYBE SOME YOU WERE BORN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CATEGORIES A HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY BELOW AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE AND ABOVE. THOSE WERE PERHAPS IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SCHOOL SIZE AND NOT ABA SIZE WE'RE NOT SURE- BECAUSE THEY'RE AWFULLY SMALL- IT TOOK TO THEM SMALLMEDIUM AND LARGE BECAUSE EVEN A SCHOOL- DISTRICTS AT ELEVEN HUNDRED IS REALLY SMALL. AND SO WE THINK THAT PERHAPS THE INTENTION- WAS FORCED SIZE OF SCHOOL AND NOT DISTRICTS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN AND ADMINISTERING THE GRANT JUST WE LOOK AT THE STATUE NOT THE STATUTE SAYS. RIGHT SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT MAYBE WE COULD BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE STATUTE- AND ALLOCATION. HOW HOW THE- HOW THE STATUTE DIRECTS YOU TO ALLOCATE EXACTLY AND WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. ON HOW TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE. OKAY AND THEN JUST FOLLOWING ON THE CHAIRMAN'S. LANA QUESTION I MEAN I THINK IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION. OF YOU KNOW WHY DO WE HAVE KIND OF THESE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND I SEE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PLAY A ROLE IN ALL THIS BUT- YOU KNOW BUT I. C. C. T. IS SORT OF. YOU KNOW AT LEAST TRADITIONALLY AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS REALLY BEEN IN THAT CASE YOU TWELVE. SYSTEM OF PROVIDING THESE DIFFERENT COURSES THAT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY SET YOU ON A PATH IN SEVENTH GRADE I AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE- YOU WILL KIDS WANT TO BE EX WE WANT TO EXPOSE THEM TO DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY TAKE TO AND HELPS THEM LEARN BETTER. AND SO. I MEAN JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON THIS IS ANY POTENTIALLY COULD AN ALLEY A GET FUNDED OVER UNDER BOTH PROGRAMS. IS THAT RIGHT- DATED THE K. FOURTEEN- THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE AND GOES TO THE LA. SO THEY GET SEE TAKE FUNDS AND THEN THEY GET THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SO IT IS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE WAY SEE TAKE AND THEY HAVE TO APPLY THROUGH BOTH TO BOTH YOUR PROGRAM YEAH AND THE CVS AND THE INTENT IS TO LEVERAGE. THOSE FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOCUS REMAINS ON THE STUDENT RIGHTS SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED THOSE PATHWAYS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR K. TWELVE EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY GO NEXT. RIGHT I JUST I MEAN IT IS FOR ME LIKE LOOKING AT IT. AT A TEN THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL I KIND OF SAY WELL WHY WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT. YEAH GRANTS. I REALLY LIKE I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE MAY RUN THIS UNDER ONE PROGRAM- AND SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THIS AND CERTAINLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ARE ALSO CONTINUING THAT EDUCATION THE TECHNICAL EDUCATION ARE CRITICAL AS PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW GRADUATING EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR NEW TRAINING TO GO INTO DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MORE SPUR TENSELY LOOKING INTO AND OF THE CHAIRMAN HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF THAT SO ANYWAYS WILL. I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M MISS- SAID IT'S JUST ONE MORE QUESTION- WITH REGARD TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED TTT TO YOUR SIDE OF THE PROGRAM. AT THE CDC TOOK ONE UP. LAST YEAR AND YEARS WENT DOWN TO. DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHY YES- WE EX THAT WE ANTICIPATE IT'S BECAUSE WE CAP TO THE AMOUNT. OF AN AWARD COULD BE TWO TWO MILLION. AS WELL AS WE- WE MADE IT SO THAT THEY HAD TO PARTNER WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO- WE ARE. IN A SENSE ENSURING THE COLLABORATION IS HAPPENING SO IN ORDER TO- APPLY YOU HAD TO HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS YOUR PARTNER AND IN THE FIRST. ROUND THEY DID NOT. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE COMPLY WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY ARE PARTNERING TOGETHER TO BUILD THOSE DIFFERENT THOSE PATHWAYS SO. WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHY- IT LIMITED BECAUSE YOU HAD TO HAVE NOT ONLY- YOU'RE A REGULAR BUSINESS INDUSTRY PARTNERS BUT YOU ALSO HAD A HAVE YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS A PARTNER IN YOUR PROPOSAL. AND THEN IN ADDITION WE CAP THE AMOUNT OF THE LARGER THE SIZE OF THE AWARD. TO MAKE SURE IT WAS MORE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE. SO WHO IS THIS PUT SO. GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO'S IN THE DRIVER SEAT IN THAT EXERCISE. WELL MY OTHER QUESTION WOULD BE DOES THE HIGH SCHOOL HAVE TO MOLD TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE MALL AND I THINK IT GOES BOTH WAYS- THE K. FOURTEEN TAPS OUR HOUSE AT. THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THEY CATHOLIC COORDINATORS OUR HOUSE WITH THE ELEAZAR. SO IT'S ABOUT BUILDING COLLABORATION- AND WE ARE WE'RE FOLLOWING THE STATUTE AND WE ARE. ADHERING TO EVERYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED- MAKING SURE THAT- WE CAN COMPLY BUT ALSO. FIFTEEN IT OUT ALONG THE WAY THAT'S WHY WE MADE CHANGES FROM YEAR ONE GRANT CYCLE TO YOUR TOO. BECAUSE WE LISTEN TO THE FIELD AND WE HEARD THEIR CONCERNS AND WE TRIED TO INCORPORATE THOSE IN THAT SECOND ROUND WILL CONTINUE. THAT PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LISTENING TAKING NO AND MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY- SO THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU MARKET FOR. AND MORE OF ABOUT IT'S GOING TO I THINK. I THINK THAT JUST EVEN HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN CD AND THE CHANCES OFFICES IT'S MUCH. IT'S BETTER IT'S A TIGHTER COMMUNICATION WHERE- TALKING ON A REGULAR BASIS TO TRY TO REALLY MAKE THE SUCCESSFUL. I APPRECIATE THAT I DO. RIGHT IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S WORKING OF THE MOTHER SHIP I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING ON THE GROUND RIGHTS AND WE ARE LIVE. WE ARE TAKING NOTES. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL- MOVED TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS. OKAY THE NAME OTHER. AREA DOCTOR MARION DOYLE OF THE WILLIAM HEART UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN DR SEAN TENENBAUM- IN JULIE- CARRIER OF THE SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I WAS IN SAN BENITO. IN THE FALL. IT'S A GREAT CAMPUS HUGE CAMPUS IMPRESSIVE PLACE THEY DO A GOOD JOB ASSEMBLY A LOT OF PASSION THERE AND A VERY INTERESTING PLACE THEY DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND A PLACE LIKE THAT THERE WAS GREAT AND SO WELL DONE SO WELL RUN SO WITH THAT- I THINK- DOCTOR DOYLE IS GOING TO START FIRST. YOU MAY RECEIVE ONE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND- OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF K. TWELVE CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA I AM DOCTOR MARIANNA SIDE DOOR OIL I'M DIRECTOR OF CAREER TECHNICAL AND ADULT EDUCATION FOR THE WAY IN THIS HEART UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SANTA CLARITA AND PRESIDENT OF ACCESS CTV'S COUNSEL REPRESENTING K. TWELVE CREW TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MY SCHOOL DISTRICT SERVES MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT RECIPIENTS OF THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDS. GRANT RECIPIENTS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDING AND WE ARE ALSO APPLICANTS FOR THE SECOND ROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN MY REMARKS WITH GRATITUDE FOR THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT FIRE LEGISLATORS. TO THE WORK OF PREPARING ALL STUDENTS FOR HIGH SKILL HIGH WAGE AND HIGH DEMAND CAREERS AS WELL AS THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION REQUIRED. TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND DREAMS. WE KNOW THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IS AN ECONOMIC DRIVER AS WE DEVELOP THE WORK FORCE OF THE FUTURE. BY STIMULATING DEEPER LEARNING THROUGH AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES WITH EMPLOYERS AND RIGOROUS CURRICULA IN THE CLASSROOM. A FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPT AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN ITS CONNECTION TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. FROM TECH PROP TO SB SEVENTY TO SB SEVEN- TEN SEVENTY THERE HAS BEEN A LEGISLATIVE IMPERATIVE TO OUR WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. DURING THE PAST DECADE HAS BEEN THE BACKBONE OF THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS AND OUR MANTRA IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. HAS BEEN TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PREPARED FOR BOTH COLLEGE AND CAREER. WE KNOW THAT THE WAY WE ACCOMPLISH THIS IS BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH EMPLOYERS AND WITH ALL OF OUR POST SECONDARY PARTNERS INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRADE SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'D FIRST LIKE TO SHARE THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT LEGISLATORS MAY ACTUALLY SEE STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDING AS A POTENTIAL CATALYST FOR THOSE EFFORTS. HOWEVERTHE EFFORT HAS BEEN MIRED WITH OBSTACLES THAT ARE PRIMARILY RESULT OF TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT ALIGN AT VERY FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS. NUMBER ONE COMBINING THE EXISTING STRONG WORK FORCE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FULL FUNDING PROGRAM WITH K. TWELVE FUNDING. HAS CAUSED UNDUE TENSIONS AND UNCLEAR DIRECTION. FURTHER COMPLICATING THIS THE APPLICATION PROCESS SEEMINGLY REQUIRE DIFFERENT AND VERY SPECIFIC GOALS FOR EACH ROUND OF THE APPLICATIONS. THE MATTER IS IN IT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE MATTER OF A PERSISTENT MYSTERY- MISPERCEPTION. THAT THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDS CONTINUE. IN SOME REGIONS K. TWELVE DISTRICTSNOTED THAT THERE PATHWAYS CHOICES IN THE APPLICATION WE'RE CHALLENGED WHEN THEY DO NOT DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH PATHWAYS OFFERED BY THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDING. OTHER REGIONS HAVE SCARED THAT THEIR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS IN THE FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS WERE NOT LOOKED UPON FAVORABLY AND NOT FORCED COMPETITIVENESS HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF COLLABORATION IN ROUND TWO. THE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THE FUNDING LEVELS AND A MANDATE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IN A REGION MEN'S THAT SMALLER DISTRICTS STRUGGLE TO COMPETE AS THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE RESOURCES TO ADEQUATELY DO SO AGAINST THE REGION'S LARGER. APPLICANTS NUMBER TWO BOTH THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT AND STRONG WORK FORCE GRANT WERE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF C. T. PROGRAMS HOWEVER. I HAVE HEARD REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CITY PROGRAMS ARE IN DANGER OF COLLAPSING DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF FUNDING. WHILE ONGOING THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT TO ENGAGE IN A COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS FOR STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDING DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DISTRICTS CFO WITH A SENSE OF SIN CERTAINTY REGARDING THAT ON ON GOING STATUS OF THE FUNDS. INDEED AS THE FUN OF ALL FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR EACH APPLICANT CANNOT EVEN BE ESTIMATED IN THIS CURRENT MODEL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY FOR ANY C. T. PROGRAM. RELYING ON STRONG WORK FORCE. THIS CONTRADICTS THE FIELD UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FUNDS AND IT APPEARS TO CONTRADICT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTIONS BEHIND THEM. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS PROCESS CAN BE MODIFIED TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS. AND PROVIDE CLEARLY SAYS FULL COMMITMENT. EVENTS NUMBER THREE IN SPITE OF THE APPLAUDED WILL EFFORTS TO ALIGN APPLICATIONS BY THE C. D. E. AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE PAPER BURDEN IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH. DISTRICTS ARE FACED WITH STATE FUNDING APPLICATIONS FOR CITY INCENTIVE GRANT STRONG WORK FORCE GRANT AGRICULTURE INCENTIVE GRANT GROUP CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMY GRANT IMPROPER PROP FIFTY ONE GRANTS. ALL DURING OVERLAPPING TIMELINES. THESE TIME LINES MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE TRULY REFLECTIVE AND THOUGHTFUL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EACH NARRATIVE. IN ADDITION TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS EACH GRANT MUST BE MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY AND THE RELATED ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES MUST BE AGGREGATED FOR REPORTING. AS ONE COLLEAGUES SHARE WITH ME ARE WE ALL TO BECOME FULL TIME BAND MANAGER AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR FACULTY AND PROGRAMS. AND NUMBER OR WITH THE- FORCE PROGRAM ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING PATHWAYS THAT CONTINUE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITING STUDENT CHOICE IN PURSUING ANY OTHER POST SECONDARY OPTION INCLUDING TRADE SCHOOLS. UNIVERSITIES MILITARY OR DIRECTLY ENTERING THE WORK FORCE. OUR IMPERATIVE IS COLLEGE AND CAREER FOR ALL STUDENTS YET THERE IS A DANGER OF TRACKING STUDENTS WHEN WE NARROW THE PATHWAYS TO ONLY ONE POSSIBLE POST SECONDARY OPTION. WHILE IT MAKES SENSE TO ALLOCATE A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS TO SUSTAIN ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH OUR POST SECONDARY PARTNERS THIS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY K. TWELVE C. T. PROGRAM. ON BEHALF OF ACCESS AND MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ASK THAT THE ASSEMBLY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT K. TWELVE CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENT CHOICE. AND STREAMLINED SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE EACH AND EVERY STUDENT IN OUR DISTRICTS AND GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING. SOME OF THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH% THIS GRANT AND HOW THEY'RE COMPLICATED TO GET IT. AND IT APPEARS THE RATHER COMPLICATED. WHEN YOU DO GET IT SO THANK YOU DR. GOOD AFTERNOON AUDIBLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE IT'S- AN HONOR TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AS WELL AGAIN- AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR OUR LOVELY CAMPUS WITH YOU IN OUR PROGRAMS- MY NAME IS DOCTOR SEAN TENENBAUM I'VE WORKED IN PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR THE PAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS NOW SERVICES SUPERINTENDENT OF SAMUEL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE I'M ALSO AN AXE A BOARD MEMBER. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS SAMIR HIGH SCHOOLS PROBABLY PROVIDED STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO A BROAD RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WHICH IS INCLUDED A CONSISTENT COMMITMENT TO CTP FOR OVER FIVE DECADES. AND IN THOSE FIVE DECADES WE HAVE NEVER WAVERED IN OUR COMMITMENT. WITH TWELVE CT PATHWAYS SPENDING NINE INDUSTRY SECTORS SEMI HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFERS ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST C. T. PROGRAMS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ALL ON ONE CAMPUS. FURTHERMORE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE SEVERAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF TRUSTEES ADOPTED A SEPARATE GRADUATION PATHWAY FOR OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. TO FURTHER SOLIDIFY OUR COMMITMENT TO SEE T. EDUCATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TODAY AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE GRANT WRITING PROCESS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND JUST IT WAS MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JULIE CARRIER I AM THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM SPECIALIST AT SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I HAVE BEEN A CT A CLASSROOM INSTRUCTOR FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS.AND DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OF IT EDUCATION I'VE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE FLUCTUATION OF CAREER TECH EDUCATION FUNDING. I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE SPECIALLY THIS COMMITTEE FOR ENSURING THE RETURN OF C. T. FUNDING AND PRIORITIZING C. T. PROGRAMS. I'M HERE TO OFFER MY EXPERTISE ON THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR C. D. PROGRAMS. AS DOCTOR TANNENBAUM STATED WE HAVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN I DUPLICATED STUDENTS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN OUR C. D. PATHWAYS. THE CITY ID FUNDS RELEASED AROUND ONE TWO AND THREE. WERE OF GREAT SERVICE TO DISTRICTS STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR PROGRAMS VIABLE AND UP TO DATE. DURING THE FIRST THREE ROUNDS YOU SEE TAKE FUNDING SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT BEGIN WORKING WITH MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS HOWEVER WITH THE DIVISION OF THE ORIGINAL FUNDS. WHICH WERE SPLIT BETWEEN THE K. TWELVE S. W. P. IN THE C. D. I. G. OUR ABILITY TO ARTICULATE. WITH ALL LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAS DIMINISHED THE K. TWELVE S. W. P. IS INADVERTENTLY CREATED PRESSURE AND LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO ARTICULATE ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS. TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN EXAMPLE TWO OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFER WELDING. COLLEGE A OFFERS WELL ONE WELDING COURSE COLLEGE BE OFFERS ELEVEN WELDING COURSES INCLUDING IT A. S. IN WELDING TECHNOLOGY THE CHALLENGE IS BEING ABLE TO ARTICULATE WITH COLLEGE BE. WHO OFFERS THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. WHEREAS I BELIEVE WHEN A TRUE NATURAL PATHWAY CURSE FOR STUDENTS THE PATH TO A SUCCESSFUL CAREER NOT BE LIMITED OR THIRD BY THE RESTRICTED AS OF A- OR. OUR PARTY IS U. K. THE LIST TO OUR STUDENTS CAREER GOALS IT IS NOT TO. THEIR CORE GOALS MEET THE OF A COURSE. IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNICABLE DISTRICTS. THE K. TWELVE APPLICATION WAS ANOTHER CHALLENGE SPECIFICALLY THE APPLICATION WAS REDUNDANT TIME CONSUMING LACK CLARITY. AND IS INDUSTRY SPEC TO SET THE SECTOR SPECIFIC. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL WAS TO CREATE NINE SEPARATE QUALITY GRANTS TO COVER EACH OF THE INDUSTRY SECTORS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE. EQUITY FOR A PROGRAMS. LAST YEAR'S A EXAMPLE I COMPLETED NINE ALMOST IDENTICAL GRANT APPLICATIONS OF WHICH ONLY ONE WAS FUNDED AND MOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS SIMPLY TO HIGH SCHOOL ROAD ONLY ONE K. TWELVE SWP GRANT THIS YEAR. IN ADDITION TO WRITING GRANTS CLYDE AND ACCEPTED A POSITION ON THE K. TWELVE S. W. P. SELECTION COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE SCORES AND CHOOSE THE RECIPIENTS FOR THE K. TWELVE US TO BE P. GRANTS. COMMITTEE HELD A ONE FIVE OUR INTRODUCTORY MEETING TO COLLABORATE THE SCORING OF THE GRANTS. THIS GOING PROCESS WAS UNCLEAR CONFLICTING AND CONFUSING. EVEN MORE SO AFTER THE CALIBRATING EXERCISE. THERE WERE NO CONCLUSIONS ARE AGREEMENTS ON WHAT THE SCORE SHOULD BE IN FACT THEY WERE EXTREME DIFFERENCES IN THE SCORING. FROM ZERO TO TEN. THIS ALLOWED TO PERSONAL INTERPRETATION AND BIAS IN THIS GOING PROCESS. THE SCORING RUBRIC IS NOT AN INTUITIVE DOCUMENT AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO FIX IT REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THE GANTS WERE ALREADY SUBMITTED. IN CONTRAST TO SEAT DOUBLE CATION WAS ALL WELL OR- ALIGNED WITH BURKE AND ANY COME. ALL PAY. ALIGNED BUT- TO BE YOU TO. AND ADJUSTED NECESSARY IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CD E. HELP TO SEPARATE TWO DAY TRAINING. SESSIONS TO CALIBRATE THE RUBRICS AND GOING PROCESS OF THE SEATING APPLICATION. THE CASE ALL OF US TO BE P. GRANT EVERY WEEK OR SO ON BALANCE LAST YEAR. THEY ADOPTED MANY OF THE TRAITS OF THE SEATED REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS YEAR THEY'RE EVEN SHARING FORMS. IF THE K. TWELVE US TO BE P. IS GOING TO UTILIZE THE SEE TWO CRITERIA. THEN THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE APPLICATION FOR ALL OF THE MONEY SCORED BY PROFESSIONALS FOLLOWING THE REGIONAL NEEDS AND ALLOWING EQUITY FOR ALL. INCLUSION IN MY EXPERT OPINION THE K. TOLD US TO BE P. AND C. TAKE MONEY SHOULD RETURN TO ONE COM COME BY ALLOCATION. REALIZE APPLIQUE. SCORED BY PROPERLY AND- THANK YOU. I HAVE THE YOU CAME HERE TO SHARE YOUR OPINION WILL THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE SHOULD THE OF A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. SO WE DON'T AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU SO LET IT GO TODAY TODAY'S YOUR DAY. I KNOW THE CHANCELLOR OVER THERE THIS CANCER WILL BE FINE HE'S A NICE GUY DOESN'T I MEAN BONE IN HIS BODY I'LL TAKE CARE WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY. I'M ON THE WHOLE ONE. SO THEY MAYBE FOR DOCTOR DOYLE. YOU YOU YOU GET A LITTLE THIS CON BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES AN ASSOCIATIVE. K. TWELVE SCHOOLS CAN CAN YOU MAYBE GIVE AN EXAMPLE OR TO SPEAK WITH HER. ABSOLUTELY SO THERE'S ISSUE- OBVIOUSLY WHEN COLLABORATION HAPPENS BUT THERE'S ALSO ISSUES THAT ARE MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL MEETING HAVING TO DO WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN THE CABLE SYSTEM AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SO PRIMARILY THINGS LIKE THE WAY THAT WE AGGREGATE DATA THE WAY THAT WE IDENTIFY AND OUR LABOR MARKET THE WAY WE CAN IDENTIFY INDUSTRY SECTORS SO AN EXAMPLE THAT I SHARED IS THAT ONE OF OUR INDUSTRY SECTORS SECTORS THAT WE- ARE VERY PROUDLY DEVELOPING IS EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE HAPPENS TO BE THIS TEACHER SHORTAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE TO ME. AND EDUCATION IS NOT A C. T. E. INDUSTRY SECTOR IN OR A C. D. PATHWAY EXCUSE ME IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THEREFORE IN WORKING WITH OUR MANDATED REQUIRED COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE CANNOT APPLY FOR SUPPORT FOR AN EDUCATION PATHWAY THROUGH STRONG WORK FORCE CONVERSELY IN OUR AREA ENGINEERING IS ANOTHER ROBUST HUMM PATHWAY THAT WE HAVE THAT MULTIPLE SCHOOL SCHOOL SITES IN MY DISTRICT. WE CANNOT APPLYING BECAUSE THAT IS NOT A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM- SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IN OF ITSELF BECOMES A PROBLEM AND AGAIN IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WHERE- IT'S NOT SIMPLE TO JUST SAY WELL SEAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIXTURES SYSTEMS YOUR YOUR CODING STRAIGHT OUR CODING IS A FOUNDATIONAL FOR THINGS LIKE AND IN. THE WAY IT PAID THE AND SO FORTH SO THERE NO NO AND JUST. THAT THE CASE CSUS. A AT AGRA YOUR DATA ALONG THE- GLASS CASE. AS WELL I'M SURE THANK THEM FOR THE COPS THE SOCKS CODES IN IT I IT IT JUST DOES NOT WE DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE SO IF. EVEN IN AND WHERE FOR IN MY WE WORK REALLY WELL WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE ARE. VERY VERY CLOSE- AND SO WE AS MUCH AS WE- STRUGGLE WITH THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THE COLLABORATION PIECE IS THERE. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES ARE A HUGE IMPEDIMENT- AS REPRESENTATIVE FOR ACCESS TO AND HAVING RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM THE FIELD. IT BECOMES MUCH WORSE WHEN THERE IS NOT THAT SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT THE K. TWELVE DISTRICTS AND- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY- NEGATIVE A- EXPERIENCES THAT. HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THAT AS WELL AND I DID MENTION WHERE THERE SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH A- MISUNDERSTANDING AROUND THE FUNDING WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IS IT K. TWELVE FUNDING IF IT'S K. TWELVE FUNDING WISE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS THERE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MUST BE ABLE TO ACCESS FOR. IT'S QUITE FOR I TO THE. SO MY- MAYBE FOR ME CARRIER. OR OR GOOD DOCTOR ARE YOU MAY THE CHIU WERE WITH YOUR TO COLLEGE IN THAT. THE REASON YOU CAN OUR WITH ONE MAYBE AND COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT I WOULD IMAGINE EVEN YOU AREA THAT PROBLEM AND I DON'T HAVE MY AREA PROBABLY WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES MY HOUSE. I CAN ACCESS PROBABLY FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS RIGHT GROW WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF MY HOUSE. LONG BEACH RIGHT BUT IN YOUR AREA I IMAGINE SOME OF THOSE COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT MIGHT HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM PROBABLY. A MUCH FURTHER DISTANCE COULD YOU ELABORATE ON. THE ANY THE COMMUNICATION RELATIONSHIP COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE THIS ONE YOU MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY WANT TO BE AT THE ONE NEXT DOOR. BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM UC AS NECESSARY. AB SO THE EXAMPLE I GAVE WS OUR WELDING. WELDING IS ON THEIR CATALOG IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNICATIVE STRICT AND A WEEK WE ALSO A PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND BUT ONE THING SEEMS TO BE A STICKING POINT- THEY- THEY UTILIZE A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL WHICH GOT SHUT DOWN BY OSHA. AND SO WE COULDN'T WE DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T AND THEN OFFERED IN THE LAST YEAR- AND SO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS BE ABLE TO DO ON ROLE WITH ANOTHER COMMITTEE COLLEGE BOTH ME COLLEGES WITHIN THIRTY MILES- IF YOU GO NORTH YOU GO SOUTH- AND SO A LOT OF ARE. A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS WANT TO GO TO THE SOUTH TO COLLEGE TO THE SECOND COLLEGE. AND WE'VE TALKED TO THAT THE- CHANCELLORS OF THE COLLEGES AND PRESIDENT AND- ONE WON'T RELEASE US TO BE ABLE TO DO ON ALL WITH THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE. INTERESTED FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM ANY RATE THE OTHER CHALLENGES THEY HAVE MAYBE WE HAVE TWELVE PATHWAYS IN A NINE INDUSTRY SECTORS THE ONLY LINE WITH THREE OF OURS. EDITED TOGETHER TO GET BACK TO MY POINT EARLIER WHICH WAS. IS IT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO A LINE OF THEM ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO OPERATE HERE. RIGHT IT SEEMS LIKE. YOU MIGHT BE HEADING THAT THEY MIGHT BE STUCK IN THEIR WAYS AND RIGHT IT'S YOUR JOB. TO MODIFY IT WELL ONE OF THE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY MADE FOR- TAKING OUR BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION PATHWAY. WAS TOO THEY HAVE A GREAT SET UP WITH A WITH FOR YEARS UNIVERSITY THROUGH THEIR BUSINESS PROGRAM. SO THEY WERE GONNA TAKE THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR CONSTRUCTION STUDENTS PUT HIM INTO THE- BUSINESS PROGRAM. AND THEN THAT WILL GET HIM INTO A CONSTRUCTION- MANAGEMENT PROGRAM METAPHOR UNIVERSITY. AND THERE'S NO CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT ALL ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAMPUS SO IT LITERALLY STOPS THEIR CD TRAINING SO WHERE'S. THE UNION STRUCTURE MANAGER IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN CORRECT WANTING TO BE A FRAMER FOR PRESS. CORRECT WHERE THEY CAN GO UNDER THE UNION AND HAVE THE UNION COULD THEN EVENTUALLY PAY FOR THEIR A AND THEIR THEIR- BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND IF THEY WANTED TO. CONTINUE TO DO THAT. SO TO FURTHER EXPAND ON THAT- CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU MENTION OUR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND PROXIMITY. IS THIRTY MILES IS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN ALL DIRECTIONS- AND WE HAVE FOR AGRICULTURE PATHWAYS THAT WE WANT TO ARTICULATE WITH THE LOCAL CAN YOU COLLEGE IN SALINAS. SO WE HAVE TO ASK FOR PERMISSION BE RELEASED ENSURE THERE WERE ENROLLED IN IN ARTICULATING WELL WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS SOUTH IF WE WANT TO GO TO THE NORTH. THE DANCER COLLEGE WITH ENGINEERING XINING ETCETERA- WE AGAIN HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PERMISSION PROCESS- IN FOR US. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ROBUST PROGRAMS ARE GROWING AND WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE PATHWAYS ARTICULATED SOLIDIFIED. I GO THROUGH THE PERMISSION PROCESS AND OR HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PROGRAMS WHICH ALREADY SOLIDIFIED IN WELL FUNDED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S NOT IN OUR BEST INTEREST. WE BELIEVE STUDENTS HAVE THAT CLEAR CHOICE CAN WE TALK ABOUT A GROUP OF CHOICE AT ALL TIMES WITH WILL BE EIGHTY G. WORST HE- AT SOME. PLEASE ONLY SO THANK YOU. IT WOULD BACK TO CONSTRUCT FOR ANY OTHER WELDING. WHICH I VISITED PRETTY. QUICK IN THAT ROOM. AND I JUST. I DON'T KNOW WHY OTHER. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHAT HAVE. YOU KNOW OTHER THAN YOU HAD OF THEM THE RIVER THAT WAS SOME PRETTY SERIOUS. EQUIPMENT WITH SOME PRETTY SERIOUS TRAINING. AND IF I'D BEEN THROUGH THAT PROGRAM PROBABLY TWO YEARS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. I'M I'M SURE I'M HIGHER BALL. UPON EXITING HIGH SCHOOL FOR SURE. BUT WHEN I GO TO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN TO PROM AND I CAN FINISH THAT CERTIFICATE PROGRAM GOT HIRED OUT UICKER. BECAUSE IT BECAUSE THAT BASE THAT THOSE SKILLS I REALLY LEARNED AT THAT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL YEAH. AND SO THEN TO REQUIRE YOU TO. THE FORM TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S MISSION I'D- I'D- DONE THAT. I'M FINE A CURIOUS. I JUST OTHER QUESTION BACK TO THE LOGISTICS OF- APPLYING FOR THE FUNDING- WHEN I HEARD OUT THERE IS PEOPLE HAVE TO WATCH A WEAPON ARE FOR TWO HOURS EVERY OTHER WEEK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN YOU APPLY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED FILLING OUT THE PAPERWORK CENTER HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS YOU HAVE TO GO TO THESE MEETINGS- AND THEN YOU END UP WITH. SB SIX THOUSAND BUCKS. WHERE ON THE C. TAKE SAID YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT WAS KERR. THE. THE ORIGINAL THE FORM THIS YEAR WAS BETTER THAN LAST YEAR BUT IT STILL ASKS THE SAME THINGS WE'RE STILL MATCHING WITH THE SAME ADA WE'RE STILL MATCHING WITH OUR SAME. POPULATION AND- IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE C. I PUT THIS. IT'S JUST SAD. AS DOCTOR DOING ONE. ONLY BECAUSE OF THE OIL MENTIONED IN THE SAME TWO AND A HALF MONTH PERIOD PROP FIFTY ONE KAY TOLD US TO BE PC DIG AND ALL OF OUR OTHER GRANTS OR DO AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME I SPENT ON K. TWELVE WAS ALMOST TRIPLE THAT I SPENT ON SEATED. AND THE SAME WITH THE OTHERS IT WAS JUST. TRYING TO GET THE MOST FUNDS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND TO RUN OUR PROGRAMS IT WAS AT THE CAN PLEASE WASTE OF TIME. IN THAT ASPECT IN IRAQ JUST WHAT WAS YOUR WHAT WAS YOUR AWARD VERSES AND THE ON THE S. W. P. VERSUS SEATED. ALL WE GOT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE SEATED. AND A STRONG WORK FOR. SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS DOLLARS YEAH BUT A LOT MORE WORK YEAH. IT WAS JUST A- RESTORATION WHEN YOU SPEND ALL THE TIME AND BASICALLY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE NINE. DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS THAT I MADE LAST YEAR WAS THE INDUSTRY SECTOR BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT THE SAME MATCH THE SAME STUDENTS THE SAME NUMBERS SO OR SIMILAR NUMBERS MMHM SO THAT WAS FRUSTRATING AS WELL OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE BEFORE WE- BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL I THINK THAT ONE JUST ONE PIECE- THERE WAS KIND OF IT WAS ALLUDED TO AND I CAN'T MEMBER BY WHOM AND THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THAT SEE TAKEN STRONG WORK FORCE ARE BOTH COMPETITIVE FUNDING. AND I WANT TO DISABUSE ANYONE OF THAT HER STANDING BECAUSE THE CITY INCENTIVE GRANTS. DOES FOLLOW EIGHTY EIGHT IT DOES LOOK AT EQUITY CONCERNS AND IT DOES LOOK OUT FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE HOW YOU MEASURE HOW YOU REFLECT ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT YOUR GROWTH IN YOUR OWN PROGRAMS. HOWEVER AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S RATED AND SO FORTH HOWEVER AS A AS DISTRICTS RESOLUTELY ETS WE HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE. YEAR TO YEAR WHICH REALLY SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO PLAN EFFECTIVELY BUILD OUR PROGRAMS EFFECTIVELY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SUSTAIN THEM- STRONG WORK FORCE COULD BE ZERO COULD BE TWO MILLION COULD BE SIX THOUSAND COULD BE WORKING OUT IN THE TAIL ON THE- THING. SO THAT IS A THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. I WITHOUT THINK MISS MISTER GOD. OF COURSE REALLY QUICKLY- WE COULD YOU SPEAK. WE HAVE EACH OF YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THE FUNDING ALLOCATION. THE PROPOSED FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR THIS YEAR THE METHODOLOGY AND- YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS MIGHT BE ON HOW HOW THAT DIFFERENCE IMPACTS SEE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE WANT IT'S A AT THE- ONE OF OUR DISTRICT KIND OF UNDERSTANDINGS IS THAT. IN ORDER FOR THE FUNDING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND- AND WE WANTED TO BE ON GOING IN ORDER FOR US TO BE IN SUSTAINABLE WE DO NOT PUT ANY PERSONNEL INTO OUR GRANTS- SO WE BUILD PROGRAMS AND THEN HIRE THE DISTRICT WILL PAY FOR THAT PERSONNEL AS WE NEED IT- AND SO. FIRST SEE TAKE. WE'RE WE'RE UTILIZING THE FUNDS TO BETTER OUR PROGRAMS. I AND- WE WORK WAIT OUR INITIAL WHEN OUR INITIAL GRANT WE HAD A BOND TO MATCH SO WE ACTUALLY GOT CONSIDERABLY MORE. WE HAD A LITTLE BIT LESS THIS YEAR BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THERE'S NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLARS BEING ASKED FOR IT HAS TO BE DIVVIED UP SOMEONE. BUT IN ORDER FOR TO BE SUSTAINABLE IT HAS TO ALSO BE RELIABLE BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S EVEN IF IT'S A EVEN AS WE ARE SUPPLEMENTING NOT SUPPLANTING WE STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FUNDING TO. CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMS AT THAT LEVEL THAT WE'VE BEEN. THAT WE'VE BEEN SERVING OUR STUDENTS. YEAH I THINK SO TO PERSPECTIVES AGAIN DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A VERY SIMILAR MODEL THE MAJORITY OF OUR- OF OUR OVERHEAD IS IN GENERAL FUND AND THIS SEE TAKE FUNDS IN TO HELP US TO SUPPLEMENT TO ONE OF THE THINGS I DID HAVE TO HIRE USING SEE TAKE QUITE FRANKLY WAS A DATA TECHNICIAN. AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY- BUT OVER ALL WE SUSTAIN OURSELVES AND THAT IS OUR MATCH THAT'S HOW WE'RE ABLE TO- RECEIVE THE C. TAKE FUNDING WITH THE TWO TO ONE REQUIREMENT AT THE LEVEL THAT WE- RECEIVE IT OUT IS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MATCH ON OUR END- I WOULD. SHARE WITH YOU THAT I THINK. I AND I COULD BE SPEAKING OUT OF TURN HERE BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE IN SOME WAYS AN ANOMALY AS I SPEAK TO OTHERS SEE TV COUNCIL MEMBERS- THROUGH ACTS THAT THERE ARE MANY DISTRICTS THAT REALLY SURVIVE AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR TEACHERS ARE FUNDED OUT OF. THE CITY INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDING OUT OF STRONG WORK FORCE AND SO- I'M- THAT'S WHERE THE COMMENT CAME FROM- WITH REGARDS TO THEIR FEAR THAT THEIR PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY COLLAPSE. YEAH AND I THINK JUST ALLEN IN MY COLLEAGUES. ARE VERY CORRECT IN IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR GENERAL FUND SO. THAT WE MAY TO CONDEMN WITH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES- IT'S A PATHWAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER FOR US AS FAR AS GRADUATION IS CONCERNED SO WE'RE FINDING EVERYONE OF OUR ELEVEN. FULL TIME TEACHERS OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND WHICH ALSO HAS A COMPETING INTERESTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION STIRS AND PURRS. AND ALL OF THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE- IN THIS THIS SOME WOMEN. ARE MENTIONED- THREE FOUR YEARS AGO WE PUT UP. MILLION ORDER. I'M NOT. WAS A COMMITMENT BY THE CAN YOU THE A LOCAL JAIL BY. TO REALLY SUPPORT KRYCEK READ. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR MISSION. TO REALLY PROVIDE THOSE GREATEST RANGE OF OPTIONS WE CARE YEAR TO YEAR. RELY ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF C. TAKE OR K. TWELVE- APPLICATION MONIES. SO WE'VE MADE THAT OBLIGATION CLEAR IN OUR GENERAL FUND BUT HAVING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING THROUGH THE SEA TAKE WOULD REALLY BE BENEFICIAL. YEAH AND I THINK THE KEY WORD THERE IS SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE AND SO WHEN WE HAVE HUGE DIPS LIKE 83% LOSS. HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR YES SOME IS A 75% LOSS- IN THAT SEE TAKE FUNDING THAT'S NOT GOING TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM RIGHT THE OTHER. IF I MAY ADD THEIR EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS SO WITHOUT THAT FUNDING I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD. KEEP IT GOING. SO YOU'RE- THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU DR TO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY FOR CUT YOUR DEAL RULES I APPRECIATE AXES ENGAGEMENT ON THIS THOSE ARE THE INFORMED VOICES ON THE GROUND IN A COMING BACK AND SHARING THEIR EXPERIENCES AND I WELCOME THAT WE NEED THAT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S A DO YOU ARE ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN HELPING SHAPE POLICY FOR SURE AND ALSO SALMON YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOL U. S. TO A GREAT JOB OUT THERE REALLY COMPREHENSIVE SIGNIFICANTLY. IN A REAL COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT ARE REALLY GETTING KIDS READY FOR THE WORK FORCE OR OR EVEN MOVING MOVING ON A TO HIGHER EDUCATION BECAUSE A SKILLS A LEARNING YOUR CLASSROOMS THEY CAN CARRY THROUGH THEIR LIFE AND IT IS SOME BIG STUFF GOIN ON OUT THERE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION OUT THERE THREE FOUR MONTHS AGO AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY OUR INFORMATION. THANK YOU. IT WILL THAT WILL INTRODUCE A- TH. PANEL CAN PREPARE TO GO UP OUR THIRD PANEL ON SUPPORTING K. TWELVE C. T. PROGRAMS SO WE'LL HAVE- LINDA GRANGER OF THE EATING AREA ARE OP.

WE REPRESENT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE EAST BAY CASTRO VALLEY HEY WORD SAN LEANDRO IN SAN LORENZO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMBINED THESE DISTRICTS SERVE ROUGHLY TWENTY TWO THOUSANDS STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE WITH FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. EIGHT NERI ROP HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF C. T. E. IN THESE DISTRICTS FOR FIFTY YEARS AND HAS WORK COLLECTIVELY TO IMPLEMENT SEATED FROM ITS INCEPTION AND WAS AWARDED THE STRONG WORK FORCE GRANT LAST YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K. TWELVE SYSTEMS WORKING GET TOGETHER TO ALIGN AND SUPPORT IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES VIA PARTICIPATION IN C. T. E. PATHWAYS. I THINK THE CD E. IN THE REGION LEADS OF THE COMMUNICABLE ITS LEVEL ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO TAKE ON THE TASK OF COORDINATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEATED AND THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAMS. YET THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES WITH THE CURRENT TO SYSTEM APPROACH TO SEE T. E. IN THE SEATED PROGRAM WHAT WAS VIEWED BY MANY IN THE FIELD AS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL US SINCE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. THE REGIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PREVIOUSLY OFFERED NO LONGER EXISTS. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE TO IMPLEMENT THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE CHALLENGES WITH THE SWP ONE TIMING UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WE HAVE TAKEN ON GO FUNDING AND TURNED IT INTO ONE TIME COME. GRANT WITH THREE MONTHS WINDOW. DOES DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE STUDENT OUTCOMES OUTLINED IN THE GRANT OVER SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD. IT'S ALSO CHALLENGING TO MAKE A LONGER TERM PLANNING DECISIONS THAT INCLUDE STAFFING WITH CURRENT WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IT LOOK FUNDING IN THIS PROGRAM. TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS IN SELECTING A WILL BE. IF ALLEGED NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING YOU. KNOW WHAT TO OF. THE P. WHO DIED FOR. OUR THE SIR. SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE TERM WHO GETS FOR. THIS IS CON OF IN AND P. AGAIN EACH OTHER. EACH READ THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAS INCREDIBLE LATITUDE TO DETERMINE HOW THE GRANTS ARE ALLOCATED WHICH LEADS TO INCONSISTENCY AND HOW PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED. IN OUR REGION THE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO FUND ALL OF THE GRANTS THAT MET THE MINIMUM QUALIFYING SCORE FOR FUNDING TO SOME DEGREE SMALL GRANTS. FOR FULL FUNDED IN THE LARGER TOWNS WERE FUNDED AT LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT THEY APPLIED FOR. IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE PROCESS LESS CUMBERSOME THIS YEAR THE GRANT APPLICATION WAS REVISED TO RESEMBLE A WORK PLAN FORMAT WITH A FEW QUESTIONS WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED SPACE TO RESPOND TO THE PROPS ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED CHARACTERS. THEY ALSO CHANNEL CHANGE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT YOU CAN APPLY FOR REDUCING IT TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER APPLICATION FROM THE FIVE MILLION MAXIMUM OF LAST YEAR AND A LIMIT OF NO MORE THAN THREE APPLICATIONS PER DISK. THIS DISCOURAGES REGIONAL COLLABORATION. THAT I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATION INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE AS EACH OF MY DISTRICT COULD INDIVIDUALLY APPLIED FOR A NEW AND GRANT ON HER EIGHT EIGHT YEAH COLOR. BUT THE PLOY TO IN THE MAPS ONLY SIX MAY. MILLION DOLLARS FOR K. TWELVE PATHWAY COORDINATOR FOR EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT GIVEN THEIR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS WITH ONLY ONE COLLEGE AND DISTRICTS WITH MULTIPLE COLLEGES HAVING ONE POSITION PER DISTRICT IS ALSO A CHALLENGE. WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND YEAR OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE JUST GOT GUIDANCE ON SELECTING THE HOST AGENCIES FOR THESE POSITIONS ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING THAT PERSON SELECTED AND READY TO START ON MAY FIRST. EACH HOST ELLIE A IS ALSO BEING ALLOCATEDA HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THIS POSITION WAS SEVENTY TWO POSITIONS THAT EQUATES TO NINE MILLION DOLLARS IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME HOW THE REMAINING THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IS BEING USED FOR THIS PURPOSE MUCH LESS HOW THE FUNDS FROM THE FIRST YEAR. HAVE BEEN UTILIZED I'VE PROVIDED ALL OF THESE EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THE CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS IT IS DIFFICULT IN ENOUGH FOR IN YOU TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU OR A- YEP THE SPECTER TO BE. FUN AMONG PRO I'M WHEN THE DEAN IS AND CERTAIN AND DESPITE OF ALL ALLEN I AM EIGHT FOUR STATE RECOGNIZE THE VALUABLE WE'LL SEE T. E. PLAYS IN OUR STUDENTS EDUCATION. WE ARE IN THE RIGHT TO. WE JUST NEED TO PER GREAT STE. FOR C. T. PRO THAT WE CAN PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;N OUT OVER TIME. TO THIS&lt;/c&gt;</u> END. TO JUST YOU CAN HOW FOR DECISIONS ARE MAY. CONSOLIDATING ON ONE. WITH A ANNUAL ALLOCATE SEEM AS IF IT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION. THIS WOULD ENABLE DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE MORE LONG TERM PLANNING TO MEET THEIR STUDENT NEEDS. WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING QUALITY C. T. E. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL DONE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR DONALD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VALERIE VIEW SICH I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR KERR TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAM R. O. P. AND I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL ORGANIZATION ARE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE COUNTY OFFICE. LEVEL I'VE WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS OF MY CAREER FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN OF SERVED AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FRESNO R. O. P. PROGRAM. IN THAT PROGRAM I OF TWENTY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER THREE COUNTIES FRESNO MADERA AND MARIPOSA IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS ONE OF THE SEVEN SEATED REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS DURING ITS FUNDED TERM OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THROUGH NINETEEN THAT PROGRAM ENDED LAST JUNE THIRTIETH. AT FRESNO COUNTY WE ARE ALSO THE LEAD AGENCY FOR A SEAT TAKE CONSORTIUM OF SEVENTEEN OF MY SMALL DISTRICTS. WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO APPLY ON THEIR OWN. FOR SEATED FUNDS WITH THE ADVENT OF THE K. TWELVE STRONGWORK FORCE PROGRAM I'VE ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE SELECTED AS A MEMBER OF CENTRAL MOTHER LODE K. TWELVE SELECTION COMMITTEE FOR THESE FIRST TWO FUNDING CYCLES. IN FOR TRANSPARENCY WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICANT FOR STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDS LAST YEAR AND DID NOT SUBMIT AN APPLICATION FOR THIS CURRENT ROUND. AS THE SEA TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM MY STAFF SERVED OVER SIXTY FIVE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE TEN COUNTY AREA OF CENTRAL VALLEY FROM BAKER STILL TO STOCKTON. THE C. TAKE OUR TAPS WERE FUNDED AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WITH THE FUNDS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE SEVEN COUNTY OFFICES BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF ELEAZAR AND AMOUNT OF ADA IN THEIR RESPECTIVE REGIONS. EACH ARE TAP HAD THE FLEXIBILITY TO DESIGN THEIR SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RECIPIENTS IN THEIR REGION AND IN MY OFFICE WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE EXPERTISE AVAILABLE ACROSS MY MANAGEMENT TEAM WHICH ALLOWED PER WRITER VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL. EXPERTISE FOR PARTNERS IN THE REGION WE BE NIMBLE AND MATCH THE STAFF MEMBER TO THIS. NEED THE YEAH. PERSON HAVE TO BE ABLE TO EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL ASK OF C. T. AND WE COULD WERE COLLECTIVELY. TO SHARE OUR NO AND- THE SEVEN SEAT TO GUARD TAPS ALSO COORDINATED OR WORK WITH EACH OTHER AND MET FREQUENTLY WITH CD STAFF IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT INFORMATION AND MESSAGING. TO ELLIE IS IN THE STATE REGARDING C. T. RULES REGULATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEVEN ELEMENTS OF A HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAM. WE WERE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER AND QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS DEVELOPING SURE MATERIALS. THAT WE COULD UTILIZE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE C. TAKE OUR TAPS ARE ALL EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS WHO OF WALK THE TALK. IN THE NEW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE- MS GRANGER ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT THE TIMELINE IN THE PROCESS- WE ARE ONE OF THE REGION'S HE WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE ONE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER IN PLACE. AT THIS TIME THOUGH ONE YEAR AFTER THOSE FUNDS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WE'RE WITHOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE STATE. WE WERE CAUTIONED BY SOME OF OUR K. FOURTEEN PARTNERS TO NOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR COLLEAGUES AS THAT WAS NOW THEIR- TERRITORY AND WE SHOULDN'T BE IMPEDING. ON THOSE ROLES. SO WHAT IS HAPPENED IS AS WE HAVE TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW OUR COLLEAGUES TO FAIL SO WEAK UIETLY ANSWER QUESTIONS IF WE CAN'T AND REFER. TO THEIR K. FOURTEEN PARTNERS. AS AS WE'VE TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD. ON IF. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO RECEIVE A FOLLOW UP CALL AFTER THAT REFERRAL BECAUSE THE ONLY A EITHER DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE THE RESPONSE WAS NOT COMPLETE OR IT WAS PERHAPS INCORRECT. AS WE ALL ATTEMPT TO NAVIGATE THE NEW FUNDING STREAMS FOR C. T. E. IT'S CLEAR THAT ARE TWO SYSTEMS HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURES. ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE WERE SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE AS EVIDENCED BY THE STATE DASHBOARD DATA ELEMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION IS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR BOTH COLLEGE AND CAREER AND OUR GOAL IS TO HELP STUDENTS EXPLORE THEIR INTERESTS AND TALENTS WHILE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY RELATE TO I'D VARIETY OF CAREER PATHWAYS. WITHIN INDUSTRY SECTORS AND WHERE THEY CAN GO TO PURSUE THEM FOLLOWING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE PARTICIPATION OF INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND WE PLACE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN WORK SITES AS A COMPONENT OF MANY OF OUR R. O. P. CLASSES. THE PURPOSE OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE SYSTEM IS TO PROVIDE COURSE WORK THAT ALLOWS ADULTS TO PURSUE ACADEMIC PATH FOR TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. OR UNIVERSITY OR SEEK JOB TRAINING SKILLS THAT CAN RESULT IN CERTIFICATION AND JOB ADVANCEMENT. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE FOCUSED ON THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE C. T. PATHWAYS THEY WILL OFFER. IT IS NOT OUR ROLE IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION TO LIMIT STUDENTS TO OUR LOCAL REGION. AS THEY PURSUE THEIR LONG TERM EDUCATIONAL AND OR EMPLOYMENT GOALS. SO FAR OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOLKS HAVE A FOCUS ON STRONG WORK FORCE WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE THAT IS THEIR PROGRAM. THERE USED TO OPERATING UNDER THOSE PARAMETERS THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF K. TWELVE PROGRAMS REGULATIONS CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS APPEARS TO BE LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. THERE'S BEEN A RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE IN C. TAKE CONVERSATIONS AS THEY DO NOT THINK THAT SEE TAKE IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. PARTICULARLY IN THE REGION'S YOU'VE NOT HIRED THERE K. FOURTEEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PERSON THE COMMON RESPONSE FROM THE STRONG WORK FORCE REGIONAL COORDINATOR K. TWELVE PARTNERS IS TO CALL CD. THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE GRANT SELECTION PROCESS AS YOU'VE HEARD HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR K. TWELVE DALY ACE. AND THE FACT THAT EACH REGION OPERATES A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHERS CAUSES CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE K. TWELVE APPLICANTS WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER IT STATE WIDE MEETINGS AND BEGIN DISCUSSING OUR K. TWELVE GRANTS. THERE'S NOT A CONSISTENCY IN THE INFORMATION THAT WE ALL RECEIVE. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HEAR THAT SOMETHING PRESENTED AT A STATE MEETING IS NOT THE SAME INFORMATION THAT ARE STRONG WORK FORCE REGIONAL COORDINATORS FEEL THEY'RE BEING TOLD. SOME REGIONS HAVE VERY BALLOT SELECTION COMMITTEES BETWEEN K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEMBERS AND OTHERS HAVE THE MINIMUM K. TWELVE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS COMING FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THERE APPEARS TO BE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING BY DECEMBER MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOLKS THAT IT ISN'T THEIR MONEY. AND THE GRANTS NEED TO LOOK LIKE THEIR GRANTS AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR PURPOSE AND FOCUS AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL. WELL THE ONLINE APPLICATION WAS MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF FEEDBACK FROM PRIOR APPLICANTS FOR THE CURRENT PHASE IT'S STILL REQUIRES MANY HOURS TO COMPLETE. LAST YEAR WE HEARD FROM COLLEAGUES IT'S BEEN AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED HOURS COMPLETING THE APPLE. IT'S RARE FOR KATE DISTRICTS TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL GRANT WRITERS ON STAFF PARTICULARLY SMALL. WORLD SOMETHING THAT MADE COMMON FOR MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SO THE TASK OFTEN FALLSTO CLASSROOM TEACHERS AND MANY OF MY SMALL SCHOOLS. THE CURRENT APPLICATION NO NEAR. FOR THE YEAR TWO ABLE TO AND- HOW APPLE RIGHT AT THE NOT THERE'S- ANOTHER. CONCERN KATE ELLIOT TO DO RESEARCH THE FUNDS ARE THE MATRIX REQUIRE TO BE REPORTED. AS A K. TWELVE PROGRAM I WILL GET CREDIT. FOR C. T. PATHWAYS. TO FROM MY PRO HAVING. TO OR MORE CTK. IN THE SAME PATHWAY. I DON'T GET CREDIT IF THEY GO STRAIGHT TO WORK OR IF THEY ENROLL IN A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. WAS OPTION ONLY OUT. TOWARDS SUCCESS OF MY PROGRAM IF THE STUDENT COMPLETED A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM FIRST. FOR THE LATEST ROUND OF K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE WE'RE SEEING A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND AS WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE NEW LIMITS ON HOW MANY APPLICATIONS. CAN BE SUBMITTED FOR ELLIE A AND SOME MAY NOT THINK THAT THEIR SPECIFIC PROJECT CAN BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE NEW MAXIMUM ALLOCATIONS THEY QUALIFY TO APPLY FOR. EXCUSE WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE SMALLER NUMBERS ONCE THE AWARDS PROCESS IS COMPLETED AND SPECIFIC QUESTIONS CAN BE ASKED OF ELLIOT. I MENTIONED APPLYING FOR THE C. TOGETHER CONSORTIUM EARLIER. UNDER THE NEW FUNDING PARAMETERS FOR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. FORMING A CONSORTIUM TO APPLY MAY ACTUALLY CREATE MORE LIMITATIONS THAN IF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTNERS APPLIED ON THEIR OWN. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT SUPERINTENDENT GRANGER ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU. A LARGER ISSUE FOR MANY OF MY DISTRICTS IS HAVING THE MATCHING FUNDS AVAILABLE. WELL SEATED DOLLARS ARE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE WE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION WE ALL KNOW THAT WE WILL RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION IF WE MEET. MY QUALIFY. SUCH GUARANTEE IN THE TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROCESS. AND THE ONLY A MAY CHOOSE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR SEATED MATCH IN ORDER TO NOT HURT THEIR CHANCES OF RECEIVING A LARGER AWARD. AND DUE TO THE TIMING OF THESE TWO APPLICATION PROCESS SEES NOT KNOWING HOW MUCH THEY REALLY WILL NEED FOR C. TO. AND WHAT THEY COULD HAVE HAD AVAILABLE FOR K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE COMES INTO PLAY. BY THE TIME ONE PROCESS FINISHES THE OTHER APPLICATION HAS ALREADY BEEN DO SO IT'S ALL A GUESSING GAME. THROUGH IN THE LOCAL MATCH FOR PROP FIFTY ONE FACILITIES AND MANY ELEAZAR TAPPED OUT. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HOLD MATCH DOLLARS BACK FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE APPLICATION. NEITHER OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE STABLE FOR THE RECIPIENTS THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH PROGRAM REMAINS THE SAME BUT HOW THE FUNDS ARE DIVIDED UP CHANGES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS IS NOT A FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR LONG TERM PLANNING. COLLEAGUE ONCE SAID YOU DON'T SPEND A GIFT CARD THE SAME WAY YOU SPEND A PAYCHECK. K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCES DEFINITELY A GIFT CARD. WE HOPE SEATED WOULD HAVE BECOME THE PAYCHECK BUT WITH THE FLUCTUATING FUNDING AWARDS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND THE CHANGES IN EIGHTY EIGHT FROM YEAR TO YEAR. IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE THE GIFT CARD THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL BY. WE'VE GONE FROM AN R. O. P. SYSTEM OF SEVENTY FOUR PROGRAMS THAT WAS FUNDED AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL. TO A C. T. E. SYSTEM FUNDING OVER A HUNDRED PROGRAMS. AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE THE STRONG WORK FORCE PIECE IS STILL ALWAYS A FLUCTUATING NUMBER. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SCHOOLS WITHIN MY SEE TAKE CONSORTIUM DO NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH NINE TWELVE SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS. TO MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTFALL. THAT THIS OVERALL REDUCTION IN C. T. FUNDING HAS CREATED. AS YOU CONTINUE TO STUDY THIS. CITY ACROSS THE STATE AND ENVISIONED WHAT ACTIONS YOU COULD TAKE TO IMPROVE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS I HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER CONSOLIDATING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO K. TWELVE VALLEY ETS. INTO ONE FUNDING STREAM BASED UPON THE SEAT HE ENROLLMENT WITHIN DISTRICTS AND PROGRAMS AND CREATE AN ALLOCATION PROCESS THAT IS FAIR BUT ALSO MORE PREDICTABLE FOR THE STABILITY OF PROGRAMS OVER THE LONG. HAUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. VERY VERY THOROUGH WELL. THANK YOU- ONE ASK YOU MISS GRANGER- DO YOU FEEL THAT ARE- PEAS OR OTHER CONSORTIUM MODELS ARE. AT A DISADVANTAGE UNDER THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. YES THEY ARE YEAH- YOU IT YOU'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE REGIONAL COLLABORATION IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FUNDING AVAILABLE- AS A CONSORTIUM THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WE CAN APPLY FOR IS TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OVER TWO. HALF YEARS SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT ACROSS FOR DISTRICTS IN IN A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T TAKE YOU VERY FAR. SO THAT'S A DISADVANTAGE WHERE EACH OF MY DISTRICT THAT THEY APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY BASED ON THEIR EIGHTY EIGHT THEY COULD APPLY FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR DISTRICT ALONE. SO IT'S DOES NOT SUPPORT REGIONAL COLLABORATION OR BIG GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND KIND OF DYNAMIC THERE TO GREET. ME AND FOR MISS OF USAGE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COLLEGE. THAT THAT THE COLLEGES HAVE A TOTAL OF THIRTY THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION A YEAR FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN COUNTY OFFICES WERE PROVIDING. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO CD WHAT WAS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST WAS IT WAS A THREE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET A YEAR DIVIDED UP AMONGST THE SEVEN COUNTIES BASED ON- 70% WAS BASED ON. THE NUMBER OF ELEAZAR IN YOUR REGION AND THE OTHER EIGHTY EIGHT. THE HIGH SCHOOL SEVEN TWELVE. IN ANY TEST WHETHER YOU'RE GIVING SO WELL. I DON'T SPEAK FOR YOU ITS SECRET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE- WE'RE QUIET TECHNICALS WAS IN ORDER I DON'T KNOW. YEAH I MEAN WE WERE KIND OF TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT FINE LINE BETWEEN HELPING FOLKS BUT NOT APPEARING AS THOUGH YOU'RE HELPING FOR SALE THE OFFICIAL. YOU KNOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE UNTIL I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD FIND FAULT WITH SOMEONE HELPING ANYONE ELSE. HELP KIDS BUT THAT'S WE THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION IF THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL REGIONS IF I UNDERSTOOD PERSONALITY THING IT'S AN ODD DYNAMIC TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT SUPPOSED TO SERVE PEOPLE- BUT- YOU TALK WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN THE SELECTION COMMITTEE COULD YOU JUST. ELABORATE ON THAT FUHRMAN YEAH WHEN YOU THE SELECTION COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS FROM WITHIN THE REGION AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR REGION THE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO FROM THE K. TWELVE SIDE- EVERYBODY WHO'S ON THE COMMITTEE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR THE GRANT. AND SO THAT JUST CREATE CON OF IT NOW YOU DON'T GET TO READ AND SCORE YOUR OWN GRANT BUT YOU'RE BRINGING THAT PERSPECTIVE INTO THE PROCESS- SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THIS ROUND OUR- THIS PLANET HAVE THE. THE CALLER. OUT IT IS WHAT IS THE GOING TO DO AND IF YOU APPLY IS A CONSORTIUM SOME ENTER THAT TO BEING THE LEADER OF THE GROUP AND THEN THERE'S A COLUMN FOR WHAT YOUR PARTNERS ARE GOING TO DO IT AND THAT WAS INTERPRETED AS YOUR DISTRICT YOU'RE WORKING WHAT WELL IF YOU'RE INDIVIDUAL- DISTRICT THAT'S SUPPLIED YOU INTERPRETED THOSE TWO COLUMNS DIFFERENTLY THAT HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO AND THEN HERE'S WHAT MY COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE GOING TO DO AND OR YOU PUT IN A BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PARTNERS SO HOW DO YOU SCHOOL. IN PEOPLE OKAY BRING THAT LENDS TO WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT THE WAY I DID IT AND SO THERE THIS DEBATE IS GOING ON WITHIN THE REGION ON HOW YOU SCORE THE PRO. THERE'S ALSO A PUSH THAT THERE. WELL AREAS OF OUR REGION COST LASHED AND ONES IN SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT WHO WASN'T FUNDED AND IT'S BECOMES WELL IF YOU'RE IF I'M GONNA LOOK AT THAT THEN WHY ARE WE MAKING THIS A COMPETITIVE SAYS THAT YOU APPLY FOR. YOU SHOULD MAKE IT AN ALLOCATION IN THE COLLEGE CITED IS AN ALLOCATION BASED ON THEIR ENROLLMENT IN THEIR DISTRICTS THAT'S HOW THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WORKS ON THEIR SITE SO WHY IS IT DIFFERENT FOR US. SO THERE WAS A COMMENT. NO THE PORTION OF COMMERCE WHERE YOU ELUDED. WITH THAT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM REWARDS STUDENTS GOING ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR NOT SAY A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL OR ANY OTHER WORKFORCE OR EVEN INTO. ON TO A TRADE SCHOOL. ACT THEY'VE GONE GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL THE WAY THE METRICS ARE SIGNED UP THAT WE ALL AGREED TO WHEN WE APPLY FOR THE DOLLARS- THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT COMPLETE THEIR PATHWAYS AND GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IS SOMEONE I CAN COUNT YOU. IDIOT LEE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER PIECE GOING INTO APPRENTICESHIP GOING INTO THE MATCH TERRY GOING INTO FOUR YEAR PROGRAM GRADUATING COMMUNITY COLLEGE THOSE OTHER PIECES ONLY CAME. UPON OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM. IN THE SAME THREE SECTOR WAY. SO IF I HAVE A STUDENT WHO COMPLETES- HELP OUT THE HIGH SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE. AND PERHAPS CHANGES OVER TO OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION MAJOR AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND FINISHES THEIR PROGRAM THERE. IF THEY WERE PART OF MY K. TWELVE LOCATION. I'M NOT GET TO KEEP THEM. AS A SIX. I PROGRAM. ON THEIR GRAD FROM THE CALL AS THEY DID A THE SAME INDUSTRY SO. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T CONTROL WHERE STUDENTS ON WHAT THEY DO ONCE THEY LEAVE CAN CAN HIM WHILE. THAT WE REALLY CONTROL THE CHOICES AND THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE AS THEY MOVE ON AS ADULTS AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE OKAY. BECAUSE THEY TRIED SOMETHING. THEY FOUND WHAT. IT AND THEY FOUND SOMETHING BETTER OR AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED ITSELF THAT CAUSED THEM TO CHANGE THEIR TRAINING PEACE SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE FACTORS THAT ARE WHAT ONE SYSTEM USES. BECAUSE IS WHAT THEY DO HOW THEY'RE ALIGNED. AND APPLY IT TO A PROGRAM WHERE WE STRUGGLE NOW WE'RE ALL IN THE PROCESS NOW OF CREATING OUR FOLLOW UP DATA FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT WILL BE TURNED IN AS PART OF OUR C. TAKE NUMBERS IN MARCH. THE ATTRITION NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT FIND IT TO CONTACT IN THE SICK MONTH PERIOD. IS SIGNIFICANT- WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THREE YEARS IN TWO MORE YEARS IF THEY FINISH IN TWO YEARS. AND AREN'T ON THE THREE OR FOUR YEAR PLAN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ATTITUDE OF WELL. I'LL DO THIS I'LL GET MY PROGRAM STARTED AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE DOING THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER. AND THAT'S A CONCERN. I THINK YOUR POINT IS THAT. THE PROGRAM IS THIS FOR STUDENTS NOT STUDENTS DON'T EXIST FOR THE PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. I DO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MR GALLAGHER'S QUESTION ABOUT. THE FUNDING OKAY IT IS GOING TO LIVE IN A LARGE EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT HERE- I SU STATUS WATCHING IT IS OFF THE GREAT GUARANTEE SO. SO I WON IT JUST CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT- IN THE PREVIOUS ROUNDS OF FUNDING WE HAD A INITIAL CONVERSATION. BEFORE THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING WENT OUT A GROUP OF FOLKS. STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE STATE WERE CALLED IN TO MEET WITH. CITY STAFF AND APARTMENT FINANCE STAFF TO TALK ABOUT. THIS SMALL MEDIUM LARGE PEOPLE THAT- DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT ONKELOS BUT TO. AND WE ALL PROTEST IT AT THE TIME THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY WAS TOO SMALL. THE MEDIUM WAS TOO SMALL AND THE BIG INCLUDED TOO MANY PEOPLE. AND THERE WERE PERSON TEN THAT SMALL WORLD AND THEY REALLY WANTED TO CHECK THE RURAL AND WE TRIED. IN THOSE. OF MISS WAS REMOTE. AND LIMITED AND THEN THAT'S GREAT. MY DISTRICTS THOSE SEVENTEEN DISTRICTS THAT PARTICIPATE IN MY CONSORTIUM APPLICATION. ARE IN THAT APPLICATION BECAUSE- THEIR SEVEN. E. EIGHT PUTS THEM AT FIVE HUNDRED AND. FIFTY TO EIGHT. AS ON THEIR OWN YET LAST YEAR WHEN THAT SMALL A SMALL BE SMALL STE C. PIECE WAS DONE. THERE WAS NO DIS AGGREGATING OF WHO WAS IN. THE LARGE GROUP THAT KIND OF GOT THE LEFTOVERS IF YOU WILL. SO MY DISTRICTS TOOK AN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HIT. IN OUR CONSOLIDATED APPLICATION BECAUSE WE WERE TREATED AS THOUGH ARE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND COMBINED ADA WAS. FRESNO UNIFIED OR LOS ANGELES AND SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE MADE TO CD E. THAT THEY IN TURN MADE TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT THEY HAVE TO THREE WAS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WHERE YOU'RE GOIN CREATE ARBITRARY. CHANGES TO THE FUNDING. WHEN I WAS A I HAD A TIME. IN AT LEAST A LOOK AT WHO ARE. OF THOSE GROUPS AND YOU HAD A CONSORT THE- I. DON'T HAVE THE STAFF. NOW TO DO THAT WHEN APPLE. THEN THOSE DISTRICTS AND PLACE THEM IN THE BUCK THEY WOULD BELONGED IN AS AN INDIVIDUAL APPLICANT. WITH THEIR MATCH FUND THEM THEN CONSOLIDATED AND SEND IT BACK TO US TO HELP THEM DO THEIR REPORTS BUT DON'T PENALIZE THEM FOR JOINING US- WHEN IT GETS FOR THEM IT'S AN EITHER OR IF WE IF WE WEREN'T HELPING HIM IF I DIDN'T HAVE STAFF SITTING HOLDING THEIR HAND. TELLING THEM HOW TO DO EVERYTHING AND GIVING IT TO US TO CONSOLIDATE IT WOULDN'T BE THERE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REALLY- WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE DATA. YOU CAN'T TELL WHEN IT SAYS FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS ALLOCATION THAT THAT SEVENTEEN DISTRICTS ON THE ALLOCATION SO THIS ONE EXTRA WERE REALLY LOOKING. IN SAYS NOT MAKING A- BASED ON A NUMBER ASSIGNED THANKS. TO GET PLAN AND I JUST OUT OF THE THAT THAT'S- THEY'RE GREAT AMPLE OF FOR PRESS. ARE OUT WE CAN TO THE BIZARRE TO REGIONAL COLLAB. BECAUSE YOU GET BACK TO NOT PLAY. THANK YOU TO THE TOWN WHERE WITH THAT WERE GONNA GO TO COM. YOU COME TO MY COULD IN. STATE YOUR AFFILIATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND ALL ONE MINUTE ONLY. ONLY WE WANT TO HEAR YOU BUT BE EFFICIENT PLACE. I WONDERED. WELL I'M CALLING ON WOULD. TRY AGAIN TEST TEST THERE WE GO. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL FOR THIS MEETING FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION ALSO FOUND A MEMBER OF THE GET REAL COALITION- VERY- STRONG INSIGHTS INTO SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS WITH STRONG WORK FORCE. APPROACH I WILL REMIND POLICY MAKERS THAT THERE ARE SOME HISTORICAL STRUCTURAL CONCERNS. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION VIEWS OF THE CITY. AND SOME FOLKS WHO ARE CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH PASSING BUDGETS SURE THOSE CONCERNED SO WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU IN ANY EFFORT. POSSIBLY TO REALIGN SOME OF THESE FUNDS AND FOCUS THEM MORE AT THE K. TWELVE IN THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MATT PATTON CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL TEACHERS ASSOCIATION CHIRLA DONALD AND THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE CONTINUED FOCUS ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND THE STUDENTS THAT IT SERVES. LOOKING AT THE WAY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS. EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING ON THE HEARING MY NAME IS ALLEY GARNER WITH PROJECT LEAD THE WAY. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE SAID TODAY THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE GOT ECHOED I SPOKE WITH ADMINISTRATORS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. I YUBA CITY LONG BEACH UNIFIED AND HOW UNIFIED SO HIT KIND OF ALL OVER THE STATE. AND A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE NOTICED WHERE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE WERE DIRECTLY ALLOCATED TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YET THE SCHOOLS HAD TO COMPETE FOR THEIR FUNDS. I THINK THAT THE KEY TAKE AWAY FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE SUPPOSED TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE STUDENTS AND YET. THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO COMPETE WHILE COLLEGES IMMEDIATELY GET THOSE DOLLARS ADDITIONALLY A TWO TO ONE MATCH WHERE THERE'S NO MATCH COMING FROM ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS A HUGE DISINCENTIVE FOR THE- FOR THE SCHOOLS TO BE GETTING THOSE DOLLARS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AT HIGHS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AS YOU KNOW. LAST YEAR WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED EFFORTS. TIME WITH YOUR LEGISLATION AND OTHERS TO CONTINUE A C. TAIG FUNDING. AND TO CONTINUE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AS THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SHIFT HAS OCCURRED AND- PEOPLE ARE ADJUSTING THAT BUT I DO WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS. WITH FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. EVERYTHING THEY SAID MATTERED EXACTLY WHAT OUR PROGRAM EXPERTS HAVE BEEN TELLING US- BUT WE ALSO HAD A CONSORTIUM OF FINDING- THROUGH- THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHICH WAS THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE DISTRICTS. AND THAT COVERED SEVEN CO EASE- AND SO THAT FUNDING WAS WHAT WAS BEING USED TO. SUPPORT THOSE DISTRICTS. SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE WAS TO HELP. SOME OF THE C. T. E. PROGRAMMING- BY A CREDENTIALING TEACHERS AND PROVIDING SUPPORT THERE- AND OTHER SERVICES SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. CD AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF A FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD APP. OUT DON'T YOU FOR CONTINUING TO KEEP CITY IN THE LIMELIGHT- I'M ALYSSA LYNCH FROM METROPOLITAN EDUCATION DISTRICT REPRESENTING SIX DISTRICTS IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I'M HERE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP CENTERS- AT THE FOUR FRIENDS- CENTERS HAVE BEEN. I WANT TO SAY SOMETIMES LEFT OUT OR FORGOTTEN BUT YET I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF THE MOVEMENT OF C. T. E. AND C. TAKE FUNDS. AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE ARDS SIX DISTRICTS DID PROVIDE US ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. AND NOW WE WILL BE RECEIVING ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. OUR DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION SERVICES LAST YEAR'S SERVED ON THE- THE RUBRIC COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING THE RUBRIC FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE. WE HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY C. T. A VERY STRONG REPUTATION FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. AND WE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE GRANT. WE MISSED IT BY TWO POINTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY SEVEN CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW THERE ARE ONLY FOURTEEN. MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT WE TO WILL DISAPPEAR. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON SEATED FUNDS AND STRONG WORK FORCE FUNDS SO I'M HOPING THIS COMMITTEE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT ALL CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL MY NAME IS NICOLE NEWMAN- I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WHEELING UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT I WANT TO ALSO THINK- ASSEMBLYMAN ON JAMES GALLAGHER OR HIS ADVOCACY FOR- THIS KAMAL SCHOOLS IN HIS DISTRICT- MY SCHOOL HAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE STUDENTS AND SENATE SEAT TAKE ORIGINATED IN WE LIVE WE'VE GONE FROM ONE PATHWAY TO EIGHT. THE ISSUES FOR SMALL DISTRICTS IS THAT THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY OR CLEAR EXCELLENT EXPLANATION OF HOW WE ARE FUNDED. LONG TERM PLANNING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE LAST ROUND AS- ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER SAID WHEATLAND LOST TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- FROM WHAT WAS PUBLICIZED THAT WAS GOING TO BE. GONNA BE APPROVED IN THE JANUARY STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING. CATEGORIZING THESE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MOSTLY RURAL DISTRICTS AS LARGE WILL BE THE DEMISE OF ALL THE GREAT WORK. BETTER STAFF IS DONE THIS FUNDING ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND CONTINUE TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS TO PREPARE THEM FOR LIFE LONG. THEIR LIFELONG ENDEAVOR WE SIMPLY CANNOT COMPETE IN THE SAME. JUST IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS LA UNIFIED IN BAKERSFIELD. IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH THAT WE LEARNED WE APPLIED FOR THE CT FACILITY PROGRAM- WE WERE FUNDED FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE WERE CONSIDERED RURAL BUT WEREN'T NO I GUESS NOT CONSIDERED SMALL WHEN IT COMES TO SEE TECH. I JUST WANT TO JUST SAVE JUST BOBBLE APPOINTS REAL QUICK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE CONSISTENT. EQUITY FOR ALL COMMUNICATION AND- LISTEN TO THE SMALL DISTRICTS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN. NINE HUNDRED THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THIS COMMITTEE TO HEAR FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT FOLKS YOU HEARD FROM TODAY MY NAME IS MARIE CALDWELL I AM THE SUPERINTENDENT A SCOTT VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SISKIYOU COUNTY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ROLLED OUT OF SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE. AND TYPICALLY OUR SCHOOLS AND SISKIYOU COUNTY ARE ALL UNDER TWELVE HUNDRED FOR VERY SMALL- I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT- TO THE C. D. E. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATION AND CLARITY ON THE FUNDING CYCLES- AND ALSO I WANT TO SHARE THAT WE HAD A REALLY WILDLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WAS STRONG. WORK FORCE WERE IN THE NORTH FAR NORTH REGION WE WERE VERY WELL ORDER IT. THEM AND YOU ARE CHECK OUT TO LAST SIX FOUR THOUSAND AND ARE STRONG WORK FORCE ALLOCATION WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND. NO WHERE CONSERVATIVE DISTRICT WE DO NOT SPEND OUR GRANT DOLLARS ON SALARY WE FOCUS OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ON SALARY THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE TO AN MATRAVERS DETAIL ANSWER WORK IS VERY CHANNEL. FOR OUR- SCHOOL TRICKS KIND SCALE IS. HORRIBLE YOU CAN'T DO IT WITH A TUTOR ONE SO IF I CAN ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO. STRONGLY ON THAT ONE. MATCH IS A HE- SYSTEM HE IN FUNDING. AND JUST SUPPORTING OUR SMALL MAKING. IT AFTERNOON GOAL ON BEHALF OF THE CAL CAN COLLEGE ASSOC FROCK EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND GRADE TWELVE IS A HAVE ALWAYS HAD IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS BUT WITH A STRONG WORK FORCE PARTNERSHIP THIS IS BECOME MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER SO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. THEY GIVE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JOE HENDRIX DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT SUTTER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OFFICE WE SERVE TWELVE DISTRICTS TOTALING ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND PARTNER WITH ELLIE A IN NEARBY COUNTIES TO PROVIDE ROBUST CAREER EDUCATION OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES I THINK TODAY'S PRISONERS OF PROVIDED A COMPELLING CASE THAT CHANGES NEEDED. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT DRASTIC SHIFT IN FUNDING HEARD OUR PROGRAMS STUDENTS TEACHERS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THE SHIPS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO COMPLETE CAREER PATHWAYS AND BECOME JOB ELIGIBLE. ALSO IF WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE PATHWAY COMPLETE ORDERS AND PREPARED FOR SUCCESS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WE NEED TO INVEST MORE INVEST WISELY AND INVEST EQUITABLY. KEEPING IN MIND THAT SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT ENJOY THE SAME ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT ARE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS THAT THAT HAD A LOT OF WONDERFUL INFORMATION THANK ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER WHO WHO'S A SPOKESPERSON FOR ARTS MALLS AS WELL. THANK YOU. HELLO I'M GEORGE READ SOME WITH THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION- THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN FUNDING IF THAT'S ALRIGHT- I BELIEVE CITY NEEDS TO BE A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE CORE THE SCHOOL COUNSELORS NEED MORE TRAINING UP ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND THE INSTRUCTORS ARE COMING FROM INDUSTRY NEED TO HAVE THEIR- YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PLACED ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL TERRY CAMERINO SUPERINTENDENT OF NORTH ORANGE COUNTY ROP AN AXE OUR REGION SEVENTEEN CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT ONLY THANK YOU FOR KEEPING C. T. IN THE FOREFRONT IT'S GOOD FOR ALL STUDENTS AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS TO BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THEY SAID. IS BEST FOR STUDENTS OF THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S PATTY ROMO AND I SERVE INTO ROLES I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR CAPISTRANO UNIFIED AND I ALSO SERVE IN THE ROLE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THERE ARE- P. WITH LAGUNA BEACH UNIFIED SO MY TO DISTRICTS SERVE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY- OF THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TWELVE THOUSAND OF THEM ARE ENROLLED IN- CAREER PATHWAYS. SO ABOUT 65% AND WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS TAKING MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSES IN CT THE CZ INTEGRATE FUNDS SAVED US BECAUSE OUR BUDGET WAS CUT ABOUT 66% YEARS AGO MY LARGE DISTRICT IS ONE OF THOSE EL CFF LOSERS AND SO THEY'RE RECEIVING PER PUPILS- FUNDING OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND EVERY NEW MANDATE EVERY NEW- COST INCREASE PUTS THEM IN A TERRIBLE POSITION OF- A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE AND SO C. T. E. SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS THEY SUPPORT CITY AS MUCH AS CITY HAS REFORMED EDUCATION IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY DONE SOME FANTASTIC THINGS WHEN THEY'RE PUT IN THAT POSITION. WE'RE REALLY TRULY RELYING ON THIS STATE GRANT FUNDING TO KEEP US GOING SO I THINK YOU I APPRECIATE EVERY DAHLE AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THIS FUNDING. MERRY WHY DIDN'T COUNTY OUR OWN AND I WANT TO. THE LIKE MY SISTER IN FRESNO COUNTY HAS ALSO SAID ABOUT- THE LITTLE GUYS TO BECAUSE THAT'S WHO I REPRESENT TO IS THE SMALL SCHOOL RULES SCHOOLS. WHO CANNOT BE STRETCHED ANY THINNER AND IT'S WITH MATCH THE MATCH THAT THEY USE FOR C. TAKE THEY HAVE NO MATCH AVAILABLE FOR K. TWELVE THEN. SO THAT'S WHY WE DO IT CONSORTIUM FOR K. TWELVE. AND IN DOING THAT ANOTHER REASON WE HAVE TO DO THAT FOR THEM IS THE SMALL SCHOOLS USUALLY HAVE ONE PERSON DOING. AG INCENTIVE- CARL PERKINS THE CT INCENTIVE GRANTS AND THEY'RE ALSO TEACHING FULL TIME WITH HARDLY WITH NO PERHAPS. SO THEY CAN'T DO ANOTHER GRANT SO THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE STEPPED IN AND TRIED HER BEST TO HELP OUT BUT THEN AGAIN WE'RE SPREADING. ENOUGH DOLLARS ALONG WITH. AND IT'S JUST NOT EFFECTIVE SO WE DO APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAD IT'S KEPT THEM AFLOAT BUT WE WOULD APPRECIATE CSUS SUSTAINABILITY THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU- BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS TODAY I'D LIKE TO THINK THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR SURE. ALSO THE LA- AND THE- THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR BEING HERE TODAY A VERY GOOD JOB THANK YOU- A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED FUNDING STREAM. TO ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY CTA PROGRAMS AS CRITICAL WE KNOW THAT'S WE'VE HEARD ABOUTSOME OF THE FUNDING ISSUES. WE ALSO HEARD- SOME OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING LOGISTICS OF APPLYING AND THEN ALSO ONCE YOU GET THE GROUND. AND THEN ALSO. HOW THE DATA'S USE RELATIVE TO. THE OUTCOMES OF THE GRANT SO THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT. AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIG OVER ARCHING ISSUES I SEE HERE IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO. TWO STREAMS OF FUNDING THAT. FOR THE MOST PART SEEM TO DO. THE SAME THING. AND THEN THERE'S SOME COLLABORATION ISSUES WITH SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN. G. WHO'S IN CHARGE AND REALLY WHO SHOULD BE IN CHARGE IS STUDENT OUTCOMES SO MAYBE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS HAPPENING. SO I WANT TO- I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TODAY IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ONGOING. CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED FOR SURE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THERE'D BE IN A MORE OLLARS FOR C. T. BUT ALSO HOW IT'S OPERATED LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED- WITH THIS PROGRAM NEED FOR THAT IT. SHOULD AS WELL AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS AND ALL THOSE WHO SAT OUT THERE AND LISTEN DILIGENTLY. AND PURCHASE IT IT PAID IN OUR CONVERSATION TODAY THANK YOU. FOR THAT THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.
