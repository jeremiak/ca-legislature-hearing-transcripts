THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR IT OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS BILL. AB EIGHT ELEVEN SIX TO STREAMLINE THE LA COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY'S PROJECT DELIVERY AS LOS ANGELES PREPARES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU WILL BRING LA METRO'S ENABLING STATUTES IN ACCORD WITH ALL OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LA METRO BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE LA METRO'S ABILITY TO UTILIZE DESIGN BUILD AS A METHOD OF PROJECT DELIVERY. THE LA METRO BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECENTLY ADOPTED THE TWENTY. EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT INITIATIVE THE INITIATIVE SEEKS TO ACCELERATE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS. TO MEET THE TRANSPORTATION DEMANDS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES. TO ENSURE EFFICIENCY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PROJECTS L. A. METRO IS AUTHORIZED TO UTILIZE DESIGN BUILD AS A METHOD OF PROCUREMENT. UTILIZING DESIGN BUILD CAN REDUCE THE OVERALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT AND EXPEDITE PRODUCT PROJECT DELIVERY. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE LA METRO BOARD OF DIRECTORS MUST APPROVE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE. EACH TIME LA METRO DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE DESIGN BUILD FOR PROJECT CONSTRUCTION. THIS REQUIREMENT WHICH NO OTHER TRANSIT AGENCY IN THE STATE MUST ABIDE BY INHIBITS LA METRO'S ABILITY TO STAY ON TRACK FOR DELIVERING KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN A TIMELY. AND EFFICIENT MANNER. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE BILL'S SPONSOR OF REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY MICHAEL TURNER.

THE STATUE WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN DESIGN BUILD ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY MECHANISMS ARE NOT AS COMMON A DELIVERY METHOD FOR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AS THEY HAVE SINCE BECOME. SINCE THE STATUE WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED A TWO STEP PROCESS THAT STATUTE REQUIRES THAT METRO FIRST APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF FINDING THAT THE ALTERNATIVE PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD IS SUFFICIENT ONLY THEN CAN WE START THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS THE BOARD MUST APPROVE THE SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT AWARD. IN A SEPARATE ACTION. TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DESIGN BUILD METHODOLOGY PROJECT DELIVERY SUB SUBSEQUENT DESIGN BUILD LOTS OF BEEN PASSED THAT DO NOT REQUIRE. THE INITIAL APPROVAL OF THE FINDING AB ELEVEN SIMPLY ALIGNS METROS AUTHORIZING STATUTE WITH THE STATE'S OTHER DESIGN BUILD STATUTES.

ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT BILL AND I SEE IT BELIEVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM IN THE BACK THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THAT IS FILE ITEM FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY GO AHEAD AND PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS- GOOD MORNING A. B. NINE SEVENTEEN WILL ALLOW TRANSIT AGENCIES TO. CAPTURE IMAGES OF VEHICLES VIOLATING TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND BLOCKING BUS STOPS. DESPITE CLEAR MARKINGS AND SIGNAGE TRANSIT ONLY LANES ARE FREQUENTLY IGNORED THE FOR EXAMPLE FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF WILSHIRE BOULEVARD IN WEST LOS ANGELES IN MY DISTRICT. FOUND ONE VIOLATION EVERY FOUR MINUTES. BUS ONLY LANE VIOLATIONS AND PARKED VEHICLES CAUSE DELAYS AND POSE SAFETY ISSUES TO RIDERS. TRANSIT OPERATORS ARE FORCED TO MANEUVER AROUND CONGESTED LANES AND MAKE DROP OFFS FURTHER FROM THE CURB. CAMERA ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO DETER DRIVERS FROM IMPEDING. RELIABLE SERVICE. FORWARD FACING CAMERAS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BUSES AND ONLY RECORD LICENSE PLATES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE BLOCKING BUS LANES IMAGES ARE THEN SENT TO LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO REVIEW AND ISSUE A CITATION. THESE CAMERON FORSMAN PROGRAMS HELP TO REDUCE VIOLATIONS AND IMPROVED TRAVEL TIMES AND ADJUST OUR PILOT PHASE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY SHOWED A 20% REDUCTION IN DELAYS. AND EVEN FEWER REPEAT CITATIONS IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AC TRANSIT SAW A 21% IMPROVEMENT IN ON TIME PERFORMANCE. AMARIN FORSMAN WORKS IT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND IDEAL FOR BUSY STREETS WHERE PARKING ENFORCEMENT IS SIMPLY NOT REALISTIC. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WILL PROVIDE RIDERS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE AND RAPID BUS SERVICE AND ENSURE PUBLIC TRANSIT REMAINS COMPETITIVE IN ATTRACTING MORE RIDERS. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ARE ADOPTING IN THIS COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR STAFF WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AND I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL. WITH ME TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OR MICHAEL TURNER DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT ALL IN METRO AND STEPHEN JONES EXTERNAL AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE AT AC TRANSIT THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- THAT YOU WOULD BE TAKING AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS WHICH JUST ADDS A MINOR REPORTING LANGUAGE- REQUIREMENT TO INCLUDE TRAFFIC SAFETY OUTCOMES. AND REQUIRES A PARTICIPATING CITIES TO HAVE PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY LOW INCOME THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL GO TO THE LINE SUPPORT LINE- MISTER TURNER FROM LA METRO WE BELIEVE HE IS ON THE LINE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF. EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN. THANK YOU MADAMCHAIR SYNDICATE MEMBERS WITH US MICHAEL TURNER FOR ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND AGAIN THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US. AS A FAMILY MEMBER OR MENTION THE B. NINE ONE SEVEN WITH AUTHORIZED PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES TO INSTALL A FORWARD FACING CAMERAS. IN OUR TRANSIT VEHICLES TO ASSIST WITH ENFORCEMENT OF PARKING VIOLATIONS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND AT BUS STOPS. IN LA COUNTY 66% OF BUS RIDERS IDENTIFIED FORTINO 15% IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF METRO'S BUS RIDERS IS LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE ABILITY OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WRITERS IS BEING DELAYED BY PEOPLE WHO PARK ILLEGALLY IN BUS ONLY LANES. FOR A SINGLE CAR THAT IS ILLEGALLY PARKED IN THE BUS LANE UP TO EIGHTY BUCKS WRITERS ARE DELAYED EACH MINUTE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND RIDERS DELAYED IN AN HOUR IF IT TAKES ON FORCED IN AN HOUR. TO CLEAR THE LANE FOR SERVICE. WITH THIS ADORING METRONET THE TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN PARTNER WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE PARKING ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. METRO WOULD NOT BE ISSUING PARKING CITATIONS UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN CITIES FOR THE EXISTING AUTHORITY. WOULD ENFORCE PARKING ON THEIR STREET. E. NINETY EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN SIMPLY CREATES AN ADDED TOOL TO ASSIST IN THIS EFFORT TO KEEP UP FLAMES CLEAR. PONDERING EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN TO AUTHORIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF TRANSIT LANE FOR SPRINT PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. CITY OF LOS ANGELES A FEMALE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND OTHER CITIES IN LA COUNTY WHERE BUS LANES OPERATE AND WILLING AND WILL OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. CURRENTLY WE OPERATE BUSES ON OVER TWENTY NINE MILES OF TRANSIT ONLY LANES WHICH ARE EXCLUSIVE TO BUS OPERATION DURING POSTED HOURS. THIS PROVIDES RAPID BUS SERVICE TO THE TEN MILLION RESIDENTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. METRO EXPANDED THE NETWORK OF TRANSIT ONLY LANES FROM TWENTY NINE MILES TO OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES OVER THE NEXT DECADE. IMPROVING THE SPEED RELIABILITY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR BUS NETWORK THROUGH AT NINE ONE SEVEN. CENTRAL TO MOVING MORE PEOPLE IT'S ALSO ESSENTIAL TO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO RETURN TO TRANSIT. OBVIOUSLY TRANSIT HAS FACED CHALLENGES IN- WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR CUSTOMERS IS THAT. IMPROVING OUR TRANSIT SERVICE IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY OF IT. IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO GETTING OUR WRITERS BACK. SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT PARKED ILLEGALLY PARKED CARS AND BUS ONLY LANES IS A SAFETY HAZARD. WHAT A CAR IS PARKED IN A BUS ONLY LANE. THE BUS EITHER HAS TO WAIT TO MOVE OR IT HAS TO SWERVE. OUT INTO TRAFFIC LANES TO GET AROUND A PARKED CAR. AND THAT IS A SAFETY HAZARD. WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO IMPROVE TRANSIT PERFORMANCE IN THE LANES AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT PARKING. IS ONE OF THE KEY IMPEDIMENTS TO IMPROVING TRANSIT SERVICE. THIS BILL WILL HELP US TO RESOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS AND IMPROVE TRANSIT SERVICE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S SIMPLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR AUTHORING THE BILL. I THINK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER TURNER AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A SECOND WITNESS- PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT WHICH IS MISTER STEVE JONES FROM AC TRANSIT ON THE COASTLINE AS WELL MODERATOR PLEASE. WITNESS JONES YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING STEVEN JOE AC TRANSIT EXTERNAL AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE URGING THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO CONNECT THEM TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT TRANSIT SYSTEMS CAN'T PROVIDE A SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE WHEN MOTORISTS ILLEGALLY PARK THEIR CARS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES OR TRANSIT STOPS. ILLEGAL PARKING MAKES PUBLIC TRANSIT LESS RELIABLE LESS SAY AND LESS ACCEPTABLE BUT IN AT RISK THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF MILLIONS OF LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. ABC TRANSIT 65% OF OUR RIDERS ARE LOW INCOME. 75% OF PEOPLE OF COLOR NEARLY HALF OF OUR WRITERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A WORKING VEHICLE. MANY TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SIMILAR RIGHT OF PROFILES. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS AC TRANSIT USE CAMERAS TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL PARKING IN THE TRANSIT ONLY LANES OF OUR NEW BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM. ON AVERAGE WE ISSUE ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE TICKETS PER DAY ON A LINE THAT CARRIES SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED RIDERS PER DAY AND IS PROJECTED TO SOON CARRY AS MANY AS ELEVEN THOUSAND RIDERS PER DAY. THE CAMERAS ARE HELPING TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL PARKING OUR SERVICES ON TIME PERFORMANCE IS EXCEEDING EIGHTY PERCENT. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NOW WRITER SERVICE WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL DELIVER THEM SAFELY AND ON TIME THE JOBS IN THE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY CENTERS AND MORE ALSO WE RECEIVED ZERO PRIVACY COMPLAINTS. I URGE YOU TO EXPAND CURRENT LAW SO THAT CAMERAS CAN BE USED TO DETER ILLEGAL PARKING AT BUS STOPS. IN ADDITION TO TRANSIT ONLY NINE. IT SO WILL PROVIDE SAFER MORE RELIABLE AND MORE EQUITABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. ESPECIALLY TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION GREAT THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON I WILL TAKE IT TO THE GALLERY IF THERE'S ANYONE IN SUPPORTIVE AB NINE ONE SEVEN WE DO HAVE SOMEONE THAT I COULD MORNING STEVE WELCOME HAVE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THE L.

BY RELYING ON THE FOLK NATION AND THAT INCREASED SURVEILLANCE OF THE COLLISION. CALIFORNIANS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED THAT BIG TAX GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE POLICE HAVE COLLABORATED TO CREATE AND BACK SURVEILLANCE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT STOCK OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. GENERALIZATION AND PERMISSION FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT AND POWER. DESPITE A LITTLE GOOD INTENTIONS TO HELP PREVENT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. EIGHTY NINE ON SEVEN GOES TOO FAR BY FOSTERING THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. SERVICE FOUNDED AND FUNDED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE REST OF THAT. THANKS FOR READING THE NEWSPAPER ROUND NOWADAYS LIKE LPR. CAMERAS ON PUBLIC BUSES. EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN RELIES ON THE FALSE NOTION THAT SURVEILLANCE BENEFITS. THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SURVEILLED.

EIGHTY NINE NINE SEVEN GOAL OF MAKING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MORE EFFICIENT IS IMPORTANT BUT PREVAILING. I'M NOT AFFILIATION. THERE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF ACHIEVING CLEAR TRANSIT ONLY LANES.

ENABLE A PAYMENT PLAN AND ESPECIALLY FOR- DISCRETION FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR FOR THE PARKING ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE- OR ME. TO ALLOW THEM TO- NOT PROVIDE A TICKET IF NEED BE IF THESE IF THEY FIND SOMEBODY MAYBE SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR OR WHAT HAVE YOU- IN ADDITION WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT THE TRAFFIC SAFETY OUTCOMES THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPROVE CONGESTION THIS IS ACTUALLY COMBINED PROVE TRAFFIC SAFETY. UNDER THAT YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW ALLOW CITIES TO CREATE DIFFERENT- STREETSCAPES BASED ON THIS INFORMATION AND OUTCOMES THAT YOU PROVIDED SO WITH THAT IN WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT TRANSIT HAS BROUGHT UP ESPECIALLY WITH RIDERSHIP DOWN I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT A WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE HERE SO I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU VENTURE WE HAVE A NEW SEATING ARRANGEMENTS I'M TRYING A NEW APPROACH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IS GETS- I DIED I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL- I AM- AWARE AND SENSITIVE TO THE PRIVACY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT I MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THIS IS A GOOD USE. OF CAMERA TECHNOLOGY THIS IS A GUY THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD AND EFFECTIVE DETERRENT. AND WHEN THE TIME TO PROVIDE LOVE B. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF POSSIBLE SAID THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN US SENATOR MAN. ONE ECHO MY- THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM FULLERTON. HI HI BOB YOU SEE WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT BUT- THE UNDERLYING POLICY HERE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A GOOD ONE WHICH AS WE ALL STATE IS ALSO EQUITABLE TO PROVIDE MASS TRANSIT TO PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET TO WORK WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FOR THEIR OWN CAR. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY OVER THE LONG RUN BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET OUR CLIMATE CRISIS UNDER CONTROL AND GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTO VEHICLES OF MASS TRANSIT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE START STEERING PEOPLE TOWARDS. AND I THINK THIS IS FINALLY GOOD POLICY AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SENATOR MCCASKEY. MAN SURE APPRECIATE IT CLARIFICATIONS OF THE- AMENDMENTS ON THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON- DISADVANTAGE OF. POPULATION I AM. AND I THINK. A LOT OF THE OBJECTIONS THAT WE HEARD FROM THAT AT LEAST PEOPLE THAT REPORTED. WHAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THAT AMENDMENT- HI AS I SAID ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT THIS MEASURE IF IT IS APPROVED HERE WILL GO THERE AND I THINK THE OBJECTIONS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT SURVEILLANCE AND THE SCOPE OF THE- THE CAMERA USE ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT FROM THE TEN- THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. WITH THAT SAID I BELIEVE I HEARD WHEN THE WITNESSES TALK ABOUT THE HAVING THE CAMERA ON THE ON THE VEHICLE WILL SPEED UP. THE TRAFFIC BECAUSE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE PARK VEHICLE THAT'S IN THE- IT'S IN THE- BUS ONLY LANE. SO I'M WONDERING FOR A SOON RIGHT NOW THERE THE- TREND THE BUS TRUCK DRIVER WHOEVER TRANSIT OPERATOR. SEES SOMEBODY THAT'S PARKED THERE SEE XTC CARD IT'S A BAND OR A REAL REAL PARKING THEY WOULD CALL. THE TOW TRUCK PEOPLE TO COME AND GET IT AND TAKE IT OUT. SO HOW DOES THE CAMERA. BEING SENT TO THE TOW TRUCK PEOPLE AND SAYING COME OVER TO THIS ADDRESS AND PICK THIS CAR UP VERSUS THE OPERATOR CALLING UP SPEED UP THE FLOW OF THE BUSES I GET YEAH IF THE IF I'M UNDERSTANDING IT RIGHT. IT MAYBE IT'S ONE THING TO MAKE THE AUTHOR SOMEBODY SURE ABSOLUTELY AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS- ALSO. A SIXTY DAY- SORT OF TIME FRAME AS WELL FOR EDUCATION BEFORE A PUBLIC EDUCATION BEFORE ANYTHING IS ACTUALLY FORCED BUT I WILL ALLOW- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT NOW OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND INCLUDE THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES. I CAN INCLUDE THE RESPONSE MY CLOTHES OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU SENATOR AKOWSKI AND I WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AND THAT PRIVACY CONCERNS MANY OF US ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE ALSO HAVE THE CHAIR JUDICIARY IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND CERTAINLY THOSE ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THAT COMMITTEE SENATOR MELINDA. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST- I. I FEEL IN ORDER TO MAKE. YOU KNOW AN INTELLIGENT AND INFORMED DECISION ON THIS BILL THAT THE QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO THE AUTHOR IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED PRIOR TO HIS CLOTHES BECAUSE IT MAY. WARRANT SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS SO IT'S HARDER TO YOU KNOW IF IT'S JUST IN THE CLOTHES WE DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH TIME TO RUMINATE OVER IT SO I WOULD JUST ASK IF WE COULD HAVE THE AUTHOR ADDRESS THAT NOW AND THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SURE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT THANK YOU AND A POINT WELL TAKEN- THE IDEA HERE IS TO BEGIN ENFORCING SO THAT PEOPLE WILL STOP- PULLING OVER IN THE CURB LANE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS AMAZON TRUCKS TNCS AND WE WILL SEE IT- OUTSIDE OF THE BUS LANES THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WELL. WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE BUSTLING. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM FOR BUS TRANSIT. BUT THE IDEA IS NOT TO- MOVE THAT CAR IMMEDIATELY IT'S TO BEGIN AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. THAT SENDS A MESSAGE- THAT'S CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT YOU'LL RECEIVE A TICKET IF- OR THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'LL RECEIVE A TICKET- IN THE IN THAT SITUATION. AND THAT WILL OVER TIME AS WE HEARD FROM BOTH WITNESSES. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF. VIOLATORS THAT EXIST ON THE STREET. TANK YOU SEMI MEMBER. DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT QUESTION OR ANY OTHER GENERAL QUESTIONS. OKAY C. NINE THANK YOU MEMBERS- SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE- YOU MAY DO SO RIGHT NOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH US AND TO YOUR SUPPORTERS AS WELL- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN PLEASE SENATOR MINT THANK YOU MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. SENATORS GONZALEZ HI. AS WELL AS I. ST STILL ALAN. SUCH A LETTER PARKLAND HIGH BECKER. CORTESE CORTESE HI DOLLY ALI NOW DOT. THE HI WHERE. BELINDA'S I'M SORRY. LET US KNOW. MAN MAN HI NEWMAN NEWMAN HI RUBIO. RUBIO HI SKINNER. HUMBERT NUMBER I LIKE HEALTHY WHAT KASKY HIGH WILL. NINE THREE OKAY NINE THREE THAT APPEARS TO HAVE ENOUGH TO GET OUT DOESN'T REMEMBER LUKE THANK YOU BUT WE'LL KEEP THAT BILL ON CALL. ALL RIGHT NEXT BILL WILL BE GOING BACK UP THE FILE FILE FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNER HOT BREATH. THE SEVEN MEMBER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPTTHE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT A BICYCLE MUST FEEL TO A VEHICLE STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION AND YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS IN AN INTERSECTION AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK YOUR CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL HER HELP IS MUCH APPRECIATED EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND MAKE INTERSECTIONS SAFER FOR BIKE RIDERS DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS BY ALLOWING BIKE RIDERS TO TREAT STOP SIGNS AS YIELD SIGNS. WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WHILE THIS MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE YIELDING IS ALREADY OF ALL VEHICLE TO ONE EIGHT OH FOUR ALREADY PROVIDES A CLEAR LEGAL DEFINITION AND EXPECTATION FOR THOSE REQUIRED TO YIELD AT INTERSECTIONS. UNDER THIS CODE SECTION THE DRIVER OF ANY VEHICLE INCLUDING BIKES APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH A YIELD SIGN MUST YIELD TO THE RIGHT OF WAY TO ANY VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS WHO HAVE ENTERED THE INTERSECTION. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO USES OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR DESIGN HELLO BIKE RIDERS APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH A STOP SIGN TO SLOW DOWN AND YIELD TO ANY CARS AND PEDESTRIANS. ALREADY IN THE INTERSECTION. IF IT IS A TO DO SO AND ONLY FOR SAFE TO DO SO BY SCHOOLS CAN THEN PROCEED. THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WITHOUT HAVING TO JUMP OFF THEIR BIKES PUT THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND AND MAKE A FULL AND COMPLETE STOP. FOR BIKE RIDERS THIS PROCESS IS INTUITIVE BECAUSE IT FITS WITH THE EVERYDAY RIDING EXPERIENCE. THEY KNOW THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE INTERSECTION BUT FOR DRIVERS THIS CONCEPT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE. SO HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THERE TO GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR BIKE RIDERS LIKE MYSELF TO REDUCE RISKS AT INTERSECTIONS. ONE TO INCREASE OUR VISIBILITY TO DRIVERS AND TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE BY SHORTENING THE PERIOD OF TIME. WE REMAIN AND WITHIN THE INTERSECTION. YIELDING ENABLES BROKERS TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. BY ALLOWING BIKE RIDERS TO RETAIN A MODEST AMOUNT OF FOR MOMENTUM THEY ARE MORE VISIBLE VISIBLE. TO WRITERS THE INVISIBLE TO CARS. HUMAN PERCEPTION BUT EVOLUTIONARILY OPTIMIZED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO MOVING AND STATIONARY OBJECTS AND IT'S ALSO EASIER. FOR DRIVERS TO SEE THINGS BETTER FOR THEM THAN ON THEIR SIDE. BIKE RIDERS ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL TIME THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET TO A POSSIBLE CRASH. WITH VEHICLES BY ENTERING AND EXITING INTERSECTIONS MORE QUICKLY THAN IF THEY HAVE TO MAKE A FULL COMPLETE STOP AND THEN RESTART UP THEIR MOMENTUM. DELAWARE ADOPTED A STOP AS YIELDS FOR BLOCK FOR BICYCLISTS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ACCORDING TO THE DELAWARE STATE POLICE CRASHES INVOLVING BICYCLISTS SPECIFICALLY. AT STOP SIGNS CONTROLLED INTERSECTIONS FELL BY 23% IN THE THIRTY MONTHS AFTER THE GOVERNOR. SIGNED THE BICYCLE FRIENDLY DELAWARE ACT INTO LAW. OTHER STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE STOP IS YOUR LEGISLATION INCLUDING IDAHO DELAWARE UTAH COLORADO. ARKANSAS WASHINGTON INCLUDING SEATTLE NORTH DAKOTA AND OREGON. WHETHER CALIFORNIANS RIGHT FOR RECREATION AS PART OF A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE CHOICES OR BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TRANSPORTATION OPTION. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO INSURERS THAT% BIKE RIDERS DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS ARE SAFE IN INTERSECTIONS WITH THE STOP SIGN. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A FIFTY FOOT REPORT. BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS NOT A BILL TO AUTHORIZE BIKE RIDERS TO DO A ROLLING STOP OR BLOW THROUGH A STOP SIGN. THAT IS THE LEGAL NOW IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL UNDER EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WHAT EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO SAYS IS THAT A DRIVER A BIKE RIDER CAN HEAL THAT INTERSECTION WITH A STOP SIGN. JUST LIKE US DRIVERS YIELD IN A ROUND ABOUT WE APPROACH THE INTERSECTION WE EVALUATE THE SITUATION WE YIELD TO THE RIGHT AWAY TO THE TRAFFIC ALREADY IN THE ROUNDABOUT. WE ONLY ANOTHER ROUND ABOUT WHEN IT'S SAFE TO DO SO WE'RE ASKING TO DO THIS. FOR BIKES AT INTERSECTIONS OF BECAUSE IT MAKES US SAFER. AND WE KNOW FROM THE DATA FROM SEATTLE. TO DELAWARE IT MAKES A SAFER. WE NEED THE GOAL OF THIS POST MAY IT RIGHT BUT BEHAVE PRINT. FOR DRIVERS WHEN THEY APPROACH BEST SIGN. ALL ROADS LEAD TO BE FREE FOR ALL ROAD USERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. TESTIFYING TODAY. IN PERSON AND THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DAVE SNYDER. FROM CAL BIKE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND WE HAVE IN HERE IN PERSON MR SCHNEIDER GO RIGHT AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU AS A MEMBER BORDER HER VOTE FOR. THE MOVING THIS FORWARD INTO THAT THAT COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS. HI MY NAME IS DAVE SNYDER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. WHEN WE FIRST CONSIDER THIS LAW YEARS AGO. THAT WE CALLED IT THE IDAHO STOP AND OUR MOTIVATION WAS PROBABLY SIMILAR TO THEIRS AT THE TIME WHEN THEY INTRODUCED IT TWENTY YEARS AGO. YOU COULD SAY THOSE ARE CONSERVATIVE VALUES LET'S GET. LOST NOBODY OBEYS OFF THE BOOKS LET'S GIVE DIGNITY TO PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN COMMON SENSE AND SAFE DECISIONS. BUT AS WE DUG DEEPER THIS YEAR WE CONSIDERED CALLING IT. DOES TAKE YOUR TURN. BECAUSE REALLY IT'S ABOUT EVERYONE TAKING THEIR TURN AT THE INTERSECTION. BUT WHEN WE DISCOVERED HOW THIS WILL IMPROVE SAFETY WE CALL IT THE SAFETY STUFF. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT EXPLAINS WHY. A LOT OF LIBERAL STATES HAVE JOINED CONSERVATIVE STATES AND SUPPORTING THIS- THE- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SAFETY I HONESTLY EXPECTED JUST TO SEE NO. MORE DANGER I EXPECTED IT TO STAY THE SAME. AND IN FACT EVERYWHERE THIS LAW HAS BEEN PASSED. THERE'S NO SAFETY PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER NO EVIDENCE THAT CRASHES INCREASED AND NOT EVEN ANY COMPLAINTS. BUT IN FACT WE FOUND THAT IT MAKES IT SAFER AS THE SEVEN MEMBER POINTED OUT IN DELAWARE CREDIBLE DATA FROM THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT. SHOWED A 23% REDUCTION IN CRASHES THAT STOP SIGN INTERSECTIONS. I HAVE SOME THEORIES AS TO WHY. THAT MIGHT BE AT AND TALKING TO PEOPLE. ONE IS OF COURSE THE- REDUCED EXPO OSIER THAT HE SENT TO ME MENTION. ANOTHER IS THAT A YOU GET TO. YOUR MOMENTUM ACROSS IT INTERSECTION. YOU HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY GET OUT OF THE WAY OF A SPEEDING CAR. ITSELF MIGHT BE RUNNING THE STOP SIGN. SO REGARDLESS OF THE REASON THIS IS DEFINITELY AN IMPROVEMENT IN SAFETY AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SAFETY STUFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SNYDER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- SO WITH THAT WE WILL GO BACK TO THE GALLERY TO SEE IF THERE ANYONE THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO. C. NONE WILL GO TO ROOM ONE TWELVE IN SUPPORT CNN. MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANYONE IN THE CONFERENCE LINE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO PLEASE.

I'M SURE WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR- SO NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE TWENTY TWO IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES ONE WHO IS- IN PERSON MISTER STEVE BARROW CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH. OF MR BARELY MAKE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MY NAME IS STEVE BARROW ON THE STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH OF THE WORKING ON TRAFFIC SAFETY THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH ISSUES FOR THIRTY SOME YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WE'RE IN WE'RE OPPOSED PRIMARILY TO THIS BILL BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH RISK IT PUTS ON OUR CHILDREN AND OUR BICYCLE RIDING CHILDREN. THE BILL IS NOT BASED ON ANY PUBLISHED PEER REVIEWED STUDIES. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE CLAIMS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL MAKE CLAIMS THAT THIS WILL. INCREASE SAFETY THERE IS NO PUBLISHED REVIEW PEER REVIEWED STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT. MATTER OF FACT THE RECENT PUBLISHED STUDIES OF BICYCLE CRASH FATALITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. SHOWS AT DELAWARE AND CALIFORNIA PART TWO OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES TO RIDE. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE TRAUMA CENTERS IN DELAWARE. YEAH I'M ON THE EMS COMMISSION AND SO WE COMMUNICATE WITH WITH TRAUMA CENTERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE TRAUMA CENTERS WILL TELL YOU THAT YEAH. WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT MORE CRASHES BUT THE CRASHES WE HAVE AT THE INTERSECTIONS. ARE FAR MORE SEVERE. THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BOLDLY GOING OUT THROUGH THE STOP SIGN. WITHOUT TAKING PRECAUTIONS WITH THE TRAFFIC COMING. WE ARE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BICYCLE FATALITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF HOSPITALIZED BICYCLE RIDERS WITH. TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN CHILDREN ARE NOT EXPERIENCED AT. HOW FAR A CAR HAS TO BE AWAY BEFORE WE GET TOO OLD WHEN THEY GO THROUGH A STOP SIGN. THE REALITY IS THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL SLOW UP AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID. AND LOOK AND MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE'S MILLIONS OF DRIVERS ON THE ROADS IN CALIFORNIA MILLIONS PEDESTRIANS. MILLIONS OF. DELIVERY TRUCKS FIRST RESPONDERS. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT. BICYCLE RIDERS THAT WANT TO JUST GO THROUGH THE STOP SIGN WILL BE FEEL EMBOLDENED. ARE BUSY ALREADY- CONGESTED STREETS OR NOT A SAFE PLACE TO DO THAT IT IS- SPECIALLY NOT SAFE FOR CHILDREN. IF THIS BILL IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE. CHILDREN SHOULD BE REMOVED IF WE WANT ADULTS TO TRY TO EXERCISE THIS. THAT'S ONE THING BUT ASKING CHILDREN WHO HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR I. DON'T KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH TRAFFIC WE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TEACHING THEM HOW TO. BE SAFE IN TRAFFIC AND THEN TO TURN AROUND AND TELL HIM- IT'S OKAY FOR YOU. EIGHT YEAR OLD SIX YEAR OLD TEN YEAR OLD TO RIDE THROUGH. A STOP SIGN IS. IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. I THANK YOU MR BERRA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO YOU'D LIKE TO WRAP THE RETURN. WORLD WE THINK THAT THE BILLS GOING TO MOVE YOUR AT LEAST HAVE TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. MAKE THIS AN ADULT ISSUE BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERIENCE WITH TRAFFIC IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT THAT RISK FOR THEM TOO. BUT AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE CHILDREN BEING HARMED BECAUSE OF THIS MISGUIDED THERE HAS BEEN STUDIES NO PUBLISHED PEER REVIEW PAPER ON THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BROKERS YOU BEING HERE IN PERSON- WE HAVE ANOTHER PRIMARY WITNESS AN OPPOSITION DR SHANNON CASTLE. A PEDIATRIC SURGEON ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF TRAUMA VALLEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL I BELIEVE- DOCTOR SHANNON CASTLE IS ON THE COASTLINE MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE DOCTORS ON THE LINE PLEASE. YES DOCTOR CANCEL YOUR LINE IS OPEN YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M DOCTOR SHANNON CASTLE PEDIATRIC SURGEON TRAUMA SURGEON OF BALLOTS AND HOSPITAL IN MADERA IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I'VE TREATED TRAUMA VICTIMS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR. MY ENTIRE CAREER I'M ALSO AN AVID ROAD CYCLIST AND I BRING MY BIKE IN URBAN AND RURAL ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH THE ENTIRE STATE I PUT THIS BILL PRETTY CAREFULLY AS A SURGEON AND AS A CYCLIST- WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CYCLISTS EVERY YEAR DYING CALIFORNIA AND ACCIDENTS WITH CARS- AD YOU KNOW COUNTLESS MORE ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED WITH MANY OF THESE THAT I SEE BEING SEVERE HEAD INJURIES. I TAKING CARE OF THESE CHILDREN I'VE BEEN HIT MYSELF I'VE BEEN HIT IN INTERSECTIONS- PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARE CLAIMING THEY YIELDING IT ASSIGNED RATHER THAN STOPPING CAN BE JUST A SAVE THE DATE ON THESE. ARE UNFORTUNATELY PRETTY WEAK- AND I KNOW FROM BEING A TEN THOUSAND MILES A YEAR ON A BIKE THAT IT'S OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE AN INTERSECTION WHEN YOU'RE GOING AT SPEED AND THAT CAN BE VERY SUBJECTIVE- CHILDREN ESPECIALLY DURING THE FULL MEANING OF A STOP SIGN AND TREATING THEM AS A YIELD SIGN WITHOUT THE MATURITY OR THE BIKE HANDLING SKILLS TO JUDGE THIS AS AS I WOULD CONCEDE. MANY ADULT CYCLISTS BLACK AS WELL IS A IS A RECIPE. FOR INJURY AND DEATH. I FULLY SHARED WITH THE BY. AT THE- ADVOCACY GROUP THAT WE SHOULD CREATE A SAY AND- FOR CYCLISTS. AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RIDE- BUT I FEEL THAT IN THE CURRENT WRITING ENVIRONMENT OUR STAGE CHILDREN TREATING STOP SIGNS THE STOPS JUSTICE CARS KEEPS THEM THE STATE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE KIDS. COMING TO MY DRAWING THEIR WORST NOT EVEN MAKE IT INTO THE TRAUMA BAY. AND SO THIS AS AS HE POINTED OUT I DO NOT BELIEVE SHOULD APPLY TO CHILDREN. THANK YOU DR CASTLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- WITNESS YOUR- THE OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME SO NOW WE'LL GO BACK TO THE GALLERY IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO C. NINE ROOM ONE TWELVE. THE NUN- MODERATORS OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO ONE TWENTY TWO ON THE CONFERENCE LINE PLEASE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ON A. B. ONE TWENTY TWO YOU MAY PUT YOURSELF IN QUEUE BY PRESSING ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. AND MADAM CHAIR AFTER ALLOWING A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO ONE QUEUING UP IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE TWENTY TWO AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATORS SO WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS- SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THE AUTHOR AND I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS DOES NOT IN ANY WAY ABROGATE THE CIVIL RESPONSIBILITY LIABILITY OF A BICYCLIST WHO FAILS TO YIELD. THAT STANDARD OF DUE CARE REMAINS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT IS TODAY IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT SENATOR UMBERG IN THE SAME THING GOES WITH RESPECT TO. THE CITATION FOR CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS FOR EXAMPLE% THAT STANDARD REMAINS EXACTLY THE SAME THE STANDARD REMAINS THE SAME IN A UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING ADDING ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- NO AMBIGUITY IN THAT ISSUE. I AM SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTED LANGUAGE AND WE JUST RECEIVED IT THIS MORNING AND WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF WE CAN ADD THAT IN A IN A FUTURE STEP IN THIS PROCESS RT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG SENATOR NEWMAN AND THEN SENATOR BAKER. YEAH THANK YOU VENTURE- ADDITIONALLY WOMAN BURNED HER RETINA HD WHEN I'VE SPOKEN AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS MESS AS YOU'RE AWARE I WAS A SKEPTIC- WHEN I WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED YOUR BILL YEAH AND I'VE I'VE COME AROUND BUT I DO TAKE SERIOUSLY MR BARROW- AND THE PHYSICIANS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDREN WHICH WOULD YOU MIND SPEAKING. TO THEIR CONCERN AND YOU KNOW TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN- CHILDREN OR UNDER EIGHTEEN BICYCLISTS AND THOSE WHO ARE ADULTS. SURE- I THINK MY BIGGEST POINT IS THE DATA THAT WE'VE HAD. AND ESPECIALLY FROM DELAWARE SO EVERY SEAT IS COLLECTED DATA THE MOST ROBUST DATA WE HAVE IS FROM DELAWARE AND THAT SHOWS A 23% REDUCTION BETWEEN BIKE CAR COLLISIONS AT STOP SIGNS WHEN. LAW LIKE EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS. ENACTED AND I AS A MOTHER WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY CHILDREN SAFE TO. AND SO I'VE TAUGHT MY CHILDREN MY SON HAS BEEN BIKING SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD HE'S BEEN BACK INTO SCHOOL SINCE HE'S FIVE CROSSING. STOP SIGNS AT INTERSECTIONS CHILDREN ARE THEY HERE LEARN YIELDING FROM THE TIME WE WOULD TEACH THEM TO LOOK BOTH WAYS AND CROSS THE ROAD. THAT'S WHAT WE DO AS PARENTS WE TEACH THEM TO BE SAFE YEAH SO WHEN AS WE GO THROUGH. AND WE LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT IS AN EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE OTHER STATES HAVE NOT DONE AS WE HAVE THIS VERY ROBUST STUDY THAT WILL COME BACK. THAT WILL SHOW US- WHAT THE DATA ON THE SAFETY IS BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT CHILDREN ARE LESS SAFE AT INTERSECTIONS. BUT YIELDING THAN STOPPING AND THERE'S NOTHING FROM RECRUITING PARENTS FROM TELLING THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY SHOULD STOP RATHER THAN YIELD RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINORS IT'S A PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY THE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND EVERY KID IS DIFFERENT MY SON ADAM HAS BEEN READY SINCE HE WAS THREE MY DAUGHTER STARTED WRITING WHEN SHE WAS FIVE. BOTH OF THEM BUT I CAN BIKE AND WALK TO SCHOOL. AND THEY GO THROUGH A STOP SIGN. AND I'VE TAUGHT MY CHILDREN TO YIELD BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BIKE THEY'RE TALLER THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'RE MORE VISIBLE WHEN THEY GOT OFF THEIR BIKES. THEY ARE NOT VISIBLE NEXT TO A CAR. AND SO THE SLOW AND THEY EVALUATE THE INTERSECTION AND THESE KIDS ARE ON THE ROLLED ROAD ANYWAYS. YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT KIDS KEEP KIDS ARE BIKING UNDER SIXTEEN. I CAN'T FOLLOW TRAFFIC RULES IS THAT THE FAULT OF THE PARENTS WHO HAVEN'T TAUGHT THEM HOW TO STAY SAFE. SO I DO THINK THAT IS A PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THERE'S NOTHING IN EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT WOULD MAKE CHILDREN LESS SAFE IN FACT IT MAKES THEM SAFER. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD JUST ADD FOR THE RECORD THAT BY THE FIVE YEAR OLD SHE HAS NO COMMON SENSE WHATSOEVER. SHE SHOULD BE BACK TO SCHOOL. MAYBE SHOULD HAVE BETTER BETTER PARENTING- I HAVE A QUESTION IT DONE ON BEHALF OF MY- ON BEHALF OF MY COFFEE. HERE IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S ON THE RECORD. I IT'S AN ARDUOUS A IT IS. TO USE CASE IT HAD LIKE A SPEAK TO. WE HAD YOU FOR WAY STOP. YEAH EVERY CAR STOP. YEAH AND YOU'VE GOT A BIKE CLUB COMING THROUGH WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY BIKERS ALL TOGETHER COMING TO A FOUR WAY INTERSECTION. HOW DOES THIS BILL TREAT THAT SCENARIO. EACH ONE OF THOSE BIKES MUST YIELD THEY CANNOT BLOW THROUGH AS AGAIN BLOWING THROUGH. A STOP SIGN ROLLING THROUGH A STOP SIGN IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO. EACH ONE OF THOSE CYCLISTS WOULD HAVE TO YIELD AS THEY COME. SO THE EACH WHOEVER'S IN THE FRONT THE YIELD THEY GO THE OTHER CARS GO. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS TO BE CLEAR THAT THEY THEY THINK COULD NOT AND LEGALLY SHOULD NOT TREAT THIS AS A LICENSE FOR ALL OF THEM. TO GO THROUGH THAT ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT'S A LEGAL NON B. I'VE LEGAL UNDER ONE TWENTY TWO AS PATIENT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN FOR A QUESTION SENATOR PACKARD WILL GO TO SENATOR RUBIO NEXT. I THINK YOU WOULD COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND I WANT TO. EMPHASIZE AGAIN THE ARGUMENTS- FROM THE COMMITTEE NOW ASSISTANCE TO THE SAFETY STOP DOES NOT CHANGE THE NUMBER YOUR RULES OF GILDING INTERSECTION. PEOPLE ON BIKES WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER TRAFFIC AN INTERSECTION FOR APPROACHING INTERSECTION WITH THE RIGHT OF WAY. IT'S ME LEGALIZES A COMMON PRACTICE WHICH IS TO SLOW DOWN AS A PORTION OR SECTION CHECK FOR TRAFFIC PROCEEDED AS SAFE. AND STOP IT IS NOT SO. I THINK YOU KNOW EVIDENCE AND OTHER STATES SHOWS THAT THIS INCREASES SAFETY. I MEAN WHAT ARE OUR KIDS BE SAFE TOO AND I. SUPPORT THIS MEASURE REMOVE IT WHEN. THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER MOVED BY CENTER BACK OR SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO. WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT MY CONCERNS THAT SAFETY CONCERNS FOR CHILDREN AND I ALREADY- YOU KNOW I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS HERE I BELIEVE MR- REQUEST SOMEONE THAT EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS. ARE NO MORE LINES WAY BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND EVEN COMING TO THE FLOOR HAD CONCERNS AND I HAD TO EXPRESS THEM TO THE AUTHOR BUT WHEN I HEAR COMMENTS LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY IT'S THE PARENTS FAULT IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO. CROSS I THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT HERE BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY CHILD GROWS UP WITH THE BICYCLE AND THEY DON'T THAT EVERY PARENT IS OUT BICYCLING WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE AVID BICYCLIST AND THAT'S NOT THE REALITY THERE'S SOME HOMES WHERE CHILDREN HAVE NEVER SEEN A BIKE AND THEY'RE ONLY ABLE TO USE IT OUTSIDE WHEN THERE'S FRIENDS AND- AGAIN THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCONNECT HERE BECAUSE NOT EVERY CHILD HAS A BIKE NOT EVERY CHILD CAN AFFORD A BIKE. AND NOT EVERY PARENT IS OFTEN ENOUGH TO HAVE A BIKE AND BICYCLE EVERYTHING- IF WE CAN WITH THEIR CHILDREN SO I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER WHAT SOME AT THE OPPOSITIONIST SAYING ABOUT THE YOUNGER CHILDREN PERHAPS NOT EIGHTEEN BUT YOU KNOW FOURTEEN OR LESS FIFTEEN OR LESS I THINK THAT THERE IS A REAL CONCERN HERE AND- AND I SAID I WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH. RESERVATIONS BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'S WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS BUT IT IS VALID I DO WANT TO VALIDATE THE CONCERNS OF THOSE HAD SPOKE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME EXACT CONCERNS AND I KNOW THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND I HOPE THAT SHE'S OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR MELINDA S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST PRIDE. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO MAKE IT A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR CYCLISTS OUT THERE. BUT I. DO HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT. CHILDREN IN THIS REGARD- AND I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU TEACH YOUR CHILDREN THE RIGHT WAY TO RIDE A BIKE AND HOW TO OBEY. THE RULES OF THE ROAD OUT THERE BUT IF- FIRST OF ALL NOT EVERY PARENT IS TEACHING THEIR KIDS THEIR SIN EVEN THOUGH WE MAY SAY WELL THAT'S BAD PARENTING THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY MAY GET KILLED OUT THERE BECAUSE- THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD SECONDLY. YOU KNOW IT JUST GET ON TECH TALK AND YOU WILL SEE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE NOT DOING THE THINGS THAT THEIR PARENTS. HAVE TAUGHT THEM SO KIDS ARE JUST YOU KNOW THEIR KIDS THEY'RE NOT AS MATURE. IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEES AS ADULTS ARE IN A NIGHT. I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. ANY KID OF ANY AGE OUT THERE IN A BICYCLE WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND THAT WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO BE ABLE TO DISCERN. WHAT'S SAFE AND WHAT ISN'T SAFE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CARS THAT. EIGHT I MEAN. THESE KIDS ARE GONNA GET KILLED IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AN APPARENT ISN'T THERE TO GUIDE THEM SO IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE IF THE BILL HAD IS SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW AGE MINIMUM FOR WHICH TO OBEY THESE PARTICULAR ROLES I STILL THINK IT'S- LARGELY CAN BE UNSAFE FOR ADULTS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CARS ARE GOING TO DO IN THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC BUT I LEAST THINK WOULD BE SAFER. IF WE RESTRICTED IT TO A CERTAIN AGE RATHER THAN. HANGING OUT IN CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS THREE APPARENTLY OF SOME OF HIM WHO ARE ON BICYCLES SO I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT AGAIN SOME OF THE STATES THAT WERE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR INSTANCE DELAWARE. DELAWARE'S ENTIRE STATE POPULATION IS LESS THAN A MILLION WE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT MORE CARS ON THE ROAD A LOT MORE CYCLISTS ON THE ROAD A LOT MORE CONTRACTED CONGESTION AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR COMPARISON. TO COMPARE IT TO A STATE LIKE IDAHO OR SOUTH DAKOTA. OR CITIES OTHER STATES WHICH HAVE AS MUCH SMALLER POPULATIONS UNFORTUNATELY- I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA IS I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP WHAT I WILL SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN VERY DEDICATED. TO WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND TO ENSURING THAT SAFETY IS ALWAYS FIRST- I THINK THIS IS FAIR IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS WITH MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS A FIVE YEAR PILOT- WITH A ROBUST SAFETY REPORT COMING BACK TO US- VIA THE C. H. P. BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- SO IT I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THAT WORK AND FOR YOUR SPONSORS WORK TOO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS CONSIDERATION YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS VERY- HUGE PASSION OF MINE AND I'M AN AVID BICYCLIST- WE BIKE RIDE AS A FAMILY AND WHEN. WE LOOK AT THE CURRENT SITUATION THE STATUS QUO DOESN'T MAKE OUR KIDS. AND OUR CYCLISTS ANY STAY FOR WE KNOW FROM STATES FROM SEATTLE TO DELAWARE. THAT- HAVING BIKE IS HEALED DOES MAKE IT SAFER I HAVE HEARD YOUR CONCERNS AND I WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU SHOULD YOU SO CHOOSE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE RECENT AMENDMENT TO THE STATE INTENDS TO REQUIRE SKILLED INTERMITTENT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. UNFORTUNATELY THE COST OF THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF. REDUCING THE PRICE OF THE LAND- FOOTBALL HOW CAN HELP WHICH WOULD BE BETTER OFF PAYING FOR THE FULL PRICE OF THE LAND. THE BILL- IT'S JUST SO AMENDED WOULD BEGIN THAT NEGATIVE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO US THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- NEXT COMMENT PLEASE. AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE OF OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY NINE FIFTY AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU WE'VE DONE BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSE FOR A. B. NINE FIFTY SO WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF NICE TO MEET YOU. I GOT A QUESTION SO THIS THIS PROPERTY WAS. ACQUIRED IN THE CEILING BY EMINENT DOMAIN AT SOME POINT FOR- THE RIGHTS FOR ALL PUBLIC TO USE IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR KEVIN CARD FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. SO I'M I'M A HUGE. FAN OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND ALL AND ALSO UNDERSTAND INTIMATED THAT MEANS THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S WHY YOU LOSE YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHT WHEN THEY TAKE IT BY CONDEMNATION. SO AS THIS LAND BEEN- OFFERED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE THAT IT WAS TAKEN FROM FOR A PUBLIC USE. SO THIS LAND- WHATEVER TRANSPIRED DECADES AGO AND IS NOW WITHIN THE PUBLIC- PORTFOLIO AND IT WILL DO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT TO CITIES OR COUNTIES FOR DIFFERENT PUBLIC PURSES. BY PURPOSE THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE CAN USE THE ORIGINAL ACQUISITION VALUE AS OPPOSED TO TODAY'S FOR FAIR MARKET VALUE. IT'S A IT'S A COST SAVING MEASURE FOR AFFORDABLE I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WHEN THAT LAND ORIGINALLY WAS TAKEN FROM THE PRIVATE. OWNERS IT WAS DESIGNED IT WAS USED FOR TRANSPORTATION I BELIEVE- AND THAT THAT RIGT IS JUSTIFIED BUT WE WOULDN'T GO OUT AND CONDEMN SOMEBODY'S PROPERTY NOW AND TEAR DOWN THEIR HOME AND SAY WE'RE GONNA PUT UP PUBLIC HOUSING OR- LOW INCOME HOUSING SO MY POINT IS THAT. THE LAND IS NOT IS NOT BEING USED FOR WHAT IT ORIGINALLY WAS CONDEMNED FOR AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO OFFER TO SOMEBODY ELSE SO THE ORIGINAL LANDOWNERS SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO GET THEIR LAND BACK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. NOT USED FOR THE ORIGINAL INTENT. AND THE USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN. I RESPECT YOUR POINT SENATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEAR US SENATOR DALEY CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU AND I JUST I DO WANT TO COMMIT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ISN'T NEEDED- FOR EXAMPLE- I UNDERSTAND THE COMMON SOUNDS ARE GREAT SENATOR JUST MADE ABOUT GIVING IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OWNERS SWEET YOU KNOW IN MY AREA WE'VE HAD LAND THAT'S BEEN SITTING THERE. FOR R. TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS ON AND THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO EXTEND FOR EXAMPLE A FREEWAY AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- FAMILIES AROUND THERE HAD OPPOSITION TO THE FREEWAY SO THE FREEWAY NEVER GOT BILLED BUT WE HAVE SUCH GREAT LAND JUST SITTING THERE VACANT UNUSED. AND WE ARE IN A CRISIS WHERE WE DO NEED HOUSING AND SO I THINK THIS IS JUST A GOOD WAY TO GET THOSE UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTIES IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT NEED HOUSING SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I WOULD LIKE TO. COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THIS AND BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN APPROPRIATE THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO ANY OTHER MY EXCEPT SENATOR BATES. FROM MY PROBLEM- WITH THE BILL IS FROM WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO O AFTER THE PROPERTY IS OFFERED ON A FIRST REFUSAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE MANY ORIGINALLY IS SUPPOSED TO GO TO REPLACE THE MONEY THE I. AND THE HIGHWAY ACCOUNTING WE CONTINUALLY RAISE TAXES. FOR ROAD REPAIRS ON GAS AT FEDERAL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND FIVE THAT'D BEEN APPROPRIATED DURING THAT TIME I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME OF WE'RE OING TO APPROVE SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS A LOWER. AMOUNT OF FOR THE PROPERTY AT LEAST THE MONEY SHOULD GO ONTO THE HIGHWAY COUNSEL FOR THAT. REASON I REALLY CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR BATES NO MIKES UP- UP SENATOR OUT. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I'M I'M PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY AND IT HAS TO DO FOR ME LARGELY BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION ASPECT THIS BILL IS GOING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE AND I JUST WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT I'M RESERVING. THE RIGHT TO MAKE AMENDMENTS AND PERHAPS EVEN OPPOSE THE BILL AND BASED ON THE P. Q. CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL BE COMING BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE- BUT I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING. EDITORS RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. C. NINE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY PARCELS OR SO THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR A AFFORDABLE HOUSING I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER BILLS RELATED TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS ON WITH CALTRANS PROPERTY THAT DO NOT CONFLICT WITH THIS BILL IT'S COMPLETELY SEPARATE SO- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

GREAT SO NEXT WE'RE ON OUR FINAL BILL FOR THE DAY. WHICH IS FILE ITEM SIX AB TWELVE THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S GREAT TO BE HRE LET ME JUST FIRST THANK. YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS BILL AS WELL AS YOUR COMMITTEE TEAM. I MUCH APPRECIATE I'D HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH CREATE A SEVEN YEAR SUNSET. IN AD IN ANNUAL REPORTING PROVISION. BY AB TWELVE THIRTY EIGHT SIXTY DECRIMINALIZED SAFE WALKING AND REMOVE UNNECESSARY FINES. UNDER CURRENT LAW PEDESTRIANS COULD BE FINED UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR. JAY WALKING. EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO CARS OR VEHICLES PRESENT. THIS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN AGAINST MANY. WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO. WALK ACROSS THE STREET TO THE PURCHASE SOMETHING OR GET TO WORK OR JUST GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES. UNFORTUNATELY THESE LAWS SEEM TO BE ENFORCED VERY ARBITRARILY. I LIKE MANY OF US HAVE CROSSED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET I'VE YET TO EVER. GET A J. WALKING TO GIVE NOT THAT YOUNG HOW DOES SHE GET TO MEET- PUTTING MY INDIVIDUAL FRIENDS WHO'VE EVER GOT A JAY WALKING TICKET YET. DATA SHOWS THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN CALIFORNIANS OVER FOUR POINT THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY. THAN OTHERS TO BE STOPPED FOR JAYWALKING. SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT PROHIBITS FINES FOR CROSSING THE STREET OUTSIDE OF INTERSECTION WHEN NO CARS OR VEHICLES ARE PRESENT. ALLOWS PEDESTRIANS TO SAFELY USE. A CROSSWALK ON A YELLOW LIGHT. IN REPEAL THE LAW BUT WHAT SIDE OF THE PROTESTS MY WALK ON. WHAT IT DOESN'T DO IS DOES NOT PERMIT UNSAFE CROSSING WHEN AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD IS PRESENT AND IMMEDIATE HAUSER'S DEFINED AS- WITH VEHICLES EITHER SO NEAR OR APPROACHING. SO FAST THAT A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DANGER OF A COLLISION. AND THIS IS A LEGAL DEFINITION SO. LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD CONTINUE TO ENFORCE UNSAFE CROSSING THE STREET WE WANT TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO ARBITRARY CITATIONS WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST ABOUT GOING ABOUT THEIR DAY TO SIMPLY CROSS THE STREET TO AGAIN GET TO THE STORE- WALK. WALK TO SCHOOL DO ABOUT THIRTY DAILY DAILY BUSINESS. AND I'M PROUD TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES- FROM- CALIFORNIA WALKS AS WELL AS- JASON SERWIS. WHO'S PERSONALLY IMPACTED. THANK YOU SOMEBODY MEMBER WONDERFUL SO WE FIRST HAVE- FEDERAL IRAQI FROM CALIFORNIA WALKS ON THE COASTLINE PLEASE CAN YOU ENSURE THAT MYSTERY HE IS ON THE LINE. I DO NOT SHOW THAT LINE CONNECTED I DO HAVE THE OTHER WITNESS TO THE BILL HOWEVER WONDERFUL WE HAVE MISTER G. SINCE R. S. AS WELL. THE WITNESS OR IS YOUR LINE IS OPEN YOU MAY PROCEED. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN'T. OKAY GREAT HELLO MY NAME IS JASON FERRIS I'M A RESIDENT OF NEVADA AND I'M CURRENTLY HOMELESS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WAS CITED FOR JAYWALKING I WAS IN DOWNTOWN A LOT OF THE TIME JOB SEARCH NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN I LIVE IN. I CROSS THE ROAD MID BLOCK TO GET TO A RESTAURANT ACROSS THE STREET THERE ARE NO CARS NEARBY AND I KNEW IT WAS SAFE TO CROSS OF COURSE I WOULD NOT HAVE PROCESS IF YOU WOULD HAVE PUT ME OR ANYONE ELSE IN DANGER AS A RULE I DON'T CROSS THE STREET WHEN CARS ARE COMING NOT BECAUSE I CAN GET A TICKET BUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET HIT. ONCE I WOULD HAVE. ACROSS STREET AN OFFICER ON A MOTORCYCLE SPOTTED ME. WHEN I GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET HE PULLED UP AND STOP ME YOU CHOSE TO SIGN ME IN A VERY VISIBLE LOCATION. IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTAURANT'S DRIVE THRU LANE. AS HE CITED ME HE BLOCKED ENTIRELY. I FOUND THE INCIDENT HIGHLY EMBARRASSING TO EVERYONE PASSING BY. I LOOK LIKE A CRIMINAL EVEN THOUGH ALL I DONE BUT SAFELY CROSS THE STREET MID BLOCK. I HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THAT DOBSON DIDN'T STOP ME BECAUSE I WAS JAY WALKING YOU STOP ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE I BELONG IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAD MY BIKE WITH ME AND SOME LUGGAGE. AND WAS OBVIOUSLY THAT I WAS HOMELESS. THAT MADE ME A TARGET. TARGET IN LOBSTER'S EYES. THE TRUTH IS PEOPLE J. WALK EVERY DAY THE NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS THE STREET. I NEVER GET SIDE. BAR FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME PEOPLE WHO STICK OUT. AS A GROUNDS FOR CITATION. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TARGETED WITH MANY PROTECTIONIST CITATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS I'VE RECEIVED FOURTEEN TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS NEAR THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT WHERE I LIVE. I RECEIVED ALL THE CITATIONS. AS A PEDESTRIAN. THEY WERE FOR A HOST OF TRIVIAL OFFENSES AND THEIR MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO CONVEY THE MESSAGE THAT I DON'T BELONG IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE HOMELESS. IT'S JUST NOT HOW MOST PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE JAY WALKING TICKETS AT THAT. FORM OF HARASSMENT. IT'S ALSO PEOPLE OF COLOR AND BLACK PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. THEY RECEIVE JAYWALKING CITATIONS AT A HIGHER. WAY HIGHER RATE. THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. LIKE HOW MUCH PEOPLE THEY ARE TARGETED. PRIMARILY FOR LOOKING LIKE THEY DON'T BELONG. THERE JAY WALKING IS A TRUE REAL FANCY CONSEQUENCES THAT FLOW FROM IT OR ANYTHING BUT INSIGNIFICANT. BY JAY JAY WALKING CITATION WAS RESULTED. IN A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. TO GET HUNG OVER ME AND MADE IT HARDER FOR ME TO IMAGINE A FINANCIAL. BE STABLE FUTURE. THE THAI CITATION ALSO INTERFERED WITH MY ABILITY TO DRIVE. THE J. WALKERS SECTORS AND WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY MY DRIVER'S LICENSE WAS SUSPENDED. BECAUSE OF THAT SUSPENSION. A TOUGH TIME FINDING THEM. THESE ARE PART OF. FOR ALMOST ACT. WHEN PEOPLE A STREET IN THE MAIN THAT THOSE NO HARM TO ANYONE. THIS NOT SUFFER FOR IT. THE STICKER MISSION BUT NO BIG JUST WITH ME FOR THE OF US. FIXED OR LOW INCOME THANK HAVE CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS. NEW ZEALAND DRIVER'S LICENSE IN JUNE HUNTER OF DOLLARS A DAY CAN. THIS IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE TREATED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN NEED. BECAUSE JAY WALKING LOGS.

AND THAT IS AT THAT HEARING TWO RED LIGHTS CROSSING AT THE CROSSWALKS. NOT JAY WALKING. AND OKAY I'M DONE PAYING ATTENTION TO ALL THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS. THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES. THE INEQUITIES OF WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE THE BURDEN OF CITATION DEBT THAT IS WEIGHING HEAVILY ON UNFORTUNATELY.

TO ADHERE TO THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. AND MAKE FIX IT TICKETS WE ALSO NEED TO REMOVE THE HIGH FINES IN MACOMB VERY SMALL CIVIL FINES. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO ALLOW US TO RAISE CHILDREN UP. LEARNING HOW TO NAVIGATE BUSY STREETS AND THERE SHOULD BE A BILL THAT'S FOCUSED ON THE ADULTS AND IT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE INEQUITIES THAT DOES NOT BY THROWING OUT ALL THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY LAWS IS NOT ADDRESSING INEQUITIES YOU STILL LEAVE THE DEBT THERE.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CORY SELLS A LITTLE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTIVELY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT COMMENT PLEASE. NOTHING MORE POLITICAL ALLIES AT THIS TIME PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION SENATOR MEN. CAN I JUST HAVE A SHORT STATEMENT URGES I'D APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND I'M CERTAINLY- THE COMMENTS AROUND RACIAL INEQUITIES ARE SOBERING AND INSTANTLY IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT. DISPARATE ENFORCEMENT OF JAYWALKING LAWS IS IT SOMETHING WE ALL SEE WE KNOW HAPPENS AND IT IS A PROBLEM. I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER WITH THE- UNIT THE PROBLEM OF ADVERSE INCENTIVES IF WE CREATE A LAW THAT AFFECTS FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE ON- IF YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT LAWS BECAUSE THE AVERAGE PERSON IS JUST GOING TO TAKE THIS AS AN AND I AND I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK AMENDMENTS TO. TO TRY TO LIMIT THE TYPES OF BEHAVIOR BUT I THINK TO THE AVERAGE PERSON OUT THERE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO HEAR THAT OKAY WALKING IS NOW LEGAL. AND I WORRY THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A LOT MORE PEDESTRIAN DEATHS A LOT MORE- PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR AND- YOU GIVEN THE HIGH RATES OF PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE STATE- YOU KNOW I GUESS IF I HAVE A QUESTION IT MIGHT BE A YOU KNOW. IT WOULD THIS BE BETTER AS AS A PILOT TO JUST GET MORE DATA BECAUSE I DID SEE AN ANALYSIS ONE OF THE- INONE OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS IS WHAT WILL THIS TYPE OF POLICY OR LEGAL CHANGE WHAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE ACROSS THE STATE- BUT BUT GIVEN JUST WHAT A MASSIVE CHANGE THIS IS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY OFF OF THIS PARTICULAR VOTE- WHILE I DO RECOGNIZE. THAT THE VERY WORTHWHILE INTENT BEHIND IT. THANK YOU SENATOR MANIFEST AND IF I MAY- THE AUTHOR DID TAKE AN AMENDMENT ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY DATA WHICH IS CURRENTLY NOT AS ROBUST AS IT COULD BE NOW. THIS THIS WOULD BE A BEFORE AND AFTER. THAT THE SEVEN YEAR SUNSET- I'M SORRY IT SHOULD BE EVERY YEAR BUT IT WOULD GIVE US A GOOD LOOK AT THE BEFORE AND AFTER. OF THIS. WITH THE INPUT OR THE- OUTCOMES WOULD BE OF THIS LAW- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THERE IS NO HARD EVIDENCE ON JAY WALKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT ALL. THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT IT SHOULD WHICH IT'S ATTRIBUTED TO. PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN A WAY THAT- CREATES. ADDITIONAL UNDUE BURDENS ON LIKE PEDESTRIAN INJURED INJURIES OR FATALITIES SO- JUST TO CLARIFY THAT BUT HE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS IN THAT REGARD AS WELL BUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO. ADD TO THAT OR YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR CLOTHES. WHILE DISALLOWING MY COMMENTS- WITH YOU MANAGER I THINK HE SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY BALLARD- I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY BUT THAT'S WHY ALL THE PEDESTRIAN GROUPS ARE WITH ME THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA WALKS WITH ME. SAN FRANCISCO BOXES WITH ME THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY ADVOCATING. FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS TO SAFE ROADS. ARE THE ONES WHO ARE EXACTLY IS SUPPORTING THIS BILL. WHAT THEY SAY IS REDUCING VEHICLE SPEED. SAVES LIVES MAKING SURE WE OR BETTER CROSSWALKS MAKING SURE WE HAVE BETTER PEDESTRIAN ACCESS. THAT'S WHAT. REALLY WILL SAVE LIVES. IN REGARDS TO THE OPPOSITION I COULDN'T AGREE MORE ON REDUCING FINES THAT'S WHY THIS BILL GETS RID OF FINES. BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT. IS REALLY. TAKEN AWAY. SO AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT PERMIT IT DOES NOT PERMIT- SAFE CROSSING. SO IF THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD IN TERMS OF VEHICLE WHICH IS COMING TOWARD PEDESTRIANS. THE OFFICER ABSOLUTELY HAS A RIGHT TO STATE. THAT PARTICULAR PEDESTRIAN SO. FAR CLARIFY. TRIPPIN PLEASE BEEN SOME MISSING NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT THE IS IN ISN'T. AND WE'RE GOING. MY GREAT CALL FROM ORANGE COUNTY- I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THIS BILL WILL CHANGE BEHAVIOR WHAT WHAT WE'LL DO. IS CHANGE THE ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT. OF BEHAVIOR THAT IS ALREADY GOING ON ALL ACROSS THE STATE AT THIS VERY SECOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FIGURE I THINK IS SOMEONE A REACTION ONE MORE QUESTION HERE AND THEN WE'LL ALLOW YOU TO WRAP UP SO IT'S A SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I ALSO. HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS EXPRESSED HERE ALREADY. BUT I YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THIS BILL IS GOOD INTENTIONS AND I CAN SEE- BASED ON THE A WITNESS I SPOKE. OF THE HOMELESS GENTLEMAN WHO SAIDTHAT IT AFFECTED HIS ABILITY TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE I DO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY WHERE DOES AN IMPACT ON SIBLEY TEND TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND DRIVING GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. WE SHOULD FOCUS ON HAVING SOME KIND OF METRICS THAT SAYS. YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY COMPAY AND THOSE THAT DON'T THERE SHOULD BE OPTIONS. ARE OUT ON HOW O TAKE CARE OF THAT INFECTION WITHOUT. REALLY HAVING TO BE BOGGED DOWN WITH DAD WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. IT WILL BE. EXTREMELY CONFUSING TO ARE YOU SENT AGAIN I HAVE TO COME FROM THE TEACHER PERSPECTIVE AND- YOU KNOW SYSTEM PRINCIPAL RICE ALL SHOWS OF OUR CHILDREN CROSSING THE STREETS AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND YOU KNOW I WAS HAVING TO. MONITOR AND I'VE SEEN MANY COLLISIONS OCCUR EVEN. WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO BE SAFE SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL SEND MIXED SIGNALS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TEACH A CHILD. YOU KNOW THIS IS BASED ON WHAT THE BILL STATES I BELIEVE YOU KNOW I WOULD BE IN A FRACTION OF THERE'S IMMEDIATE HAZARD. VERSUS NOT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR A CHILD TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WE'VE BEEN TEACHING ALL ALONG YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO A CROSSWALK AND BE SAFE. SO I AGAIN AS A TEACHER WHAT I'VE SEEN IN ALL THE- NEAR MISSES I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST GOING TO CONFUSE OUR YOUTH AND I STILL HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR. OUR CHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE- THE MENTAL CAPACITY OF TAKING THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY YOUNG TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AT THIS POINT I WILL HAVE TO STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IF NOT I WILL CERTAINLY ADD MY THOUGHTS AS WELL- CERTAINLY ALL THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS YOU'VE TO TAKEN TO HEART I KNOW YOU. WORKED WITH THIS COMMIT AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING SUPPORTERS- I LOOK AT THIS VERY. DIFFERENTLY AS WELL PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURES IN EQUITABLE. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY OPTIONS ARE OFTEN LACKLUSTER IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THESE ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING CONTACTED BY POLICE. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ISSUES OF JAY WALKING. WHERE THEY MAYBE WALKING SAFELY IN AN INTERSECTION. AT TEN. AGAIN MAKE NO MISTAKE SAFETY IS FIRST HERE AS AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED. THERE IS HARD EVIDENCE THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAS- INFORMATION LIKE MY OWN BACKYARD IN LONG BEACH WERE THERE A LOT OF CONTACTS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR PRIMARILY BLACK THE LONG BEACH RESIDENTS WHO'VE BEEN KIND CONTACTED BY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR JAKE WALKING. BUT THERE'S NO REAL HARD EVIDENCE THAT JAY WALKING IS ATTRIBUTED. TO PEDESTRIAN INJURIES AND FATALITIES WE DON'T HAVE THAT REPORT. SO THIS WILL ALLOW WITH AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO ADD THAT REPORTING SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT IF THERE IS A JAYWALKING ISSUE. THAT WE DO- ADDRESS THAT BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S FOR ISSUES RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AT CETERA AS IT STANDS NOW FOR DATA. SO WITH THAT- AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH OUR- OUR OFFICE I WANT TO THANK THE- THE SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION AS WELL AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH ME GO AHEAD. PICNICKING MANAGER REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ALIGN MY- BIKE MY CLOTHES WITH YOUR COMMENTS AND JUST REITERATE. THAT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY THAT'S THE PARAMOUNT THAT'S WHY THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL SUPPORTING THIS BILL. NOT JUST. NOT JUST A SOFT OPPOSE A SOFT SUPPORT BUT ACTS COSPONSORS IN AS MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS WITH THIS LEGISLATION THAT'S WHY THEY ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS BILL UP AND DOWN THE STATE.
