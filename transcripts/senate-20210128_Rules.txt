PEOPLE SERVED IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AS THE DEPARTMENT FOR AHEAD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE FOCUSED ON TELLING HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND CODE NINETEEN. ALLEN STANDS FOR CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIC CAL THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY GOALS IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING MEMBER RISK IN NEED FOR A WHOLE PERSON CARE APPROACHES AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. MOVING MEDIC CAL TO MORE CONSISTENT AND SEAMLESS SYSTEM BY REDUCING COMPLEXITY AND INCREASING FLEXIBILITY AND IMPROVING QUALITY OUTCOMES REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND DRIVING DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION FOR VALUE BASED INITIATIVES MODERNIZATION OF SYSTEMS AND PAYMENT REFORM. THE STATE IS LARGE AND DIVERSE IS. SOME COUNTIES ARE THE SIZE OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL AND SOME ARE LARGER THAN SOME OTHER U. S. STATES. THAT IMMENSE VARIETY HAS MEANT THAT CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS AND SERVICES HAVE OFTEN BURIED COUNTY TO COUNTY. STANDARDIZING SERVICES AND ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE PRESENTS CHALLENGES BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE OUR RESIDENTS IN A CONSISTENT STANDARDIZED SET OF COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON AN ACCESS NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE INCLUDING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING COMMUNITY BASED CARE MANAGEMENT IN A ROBUST SET OF SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES LIKE HOUSING SUPPORTS MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS RESPITE AND RETRIBUTIVE CARE. AS A KEY PART OF OUR VISION TO DRIVE DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES. SUCH AS HOMELESS JUST AS OF ALT ROCK ARE YOU AN AGING POPULATION JUST TO NAME A FEW. FURTHERMORE THE CODE NINETEEN HAS DISPARITIES AND SYSTEMIC RACISM IN SOCIETY AND IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEGUN TO ANALYZE VARIOUS HEALTH INEQUITIES TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO ADDRESS SUCH OUTCOMES. AND FINALLY WITH THE IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN WE MUST WORK TO PRESERVE A NETWORK OF CARE IN A DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT CARE ENVIRONMENTS WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE THE COVETED NINETEEN VACCINE A SHIFT TOWARDS TELEHEALTH ADOPTION AND HOW WE ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY. INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS AND SAFE LONG TERM CARE ENVIRONMENTS AND ADDS PEOPLE START TO ENGAGE WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AGAIN. CATCHING UP ON MISSED CHILDREN IMMUNIZATIONS PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND DELAYED CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS. ARE BENEFICIARIES OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND WE AS WE ADVANCE IN INNOVATE MEDIC CAL REDUCE HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES. INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AN ONLINE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND I HAVE I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISS COOPER WITH THAT I'M GOING TO. GO AHEAD AND GO TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL SENATOR BATES- START WITH YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND- CONGRATULATIONS ON SAFETY YOUR DISCO GIRLS GEZI AND BURST STARTING. AT OUTSIDE DOWN THERE BUT JOBS YOU GRADUATION SIGNED GOING ARE VERY VERY JOB I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT I WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SUPERVISORS WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES. WHEN THEY STARTED MEDICARE ALSO THAT AGE YOU KNOW I'M REVEALING MY AGE BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ANYWAY SO I'M THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE PROGRAM WAS SOLD VERY VITAL- BACK IN THOSE DAYS WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD. AND CERTAINLY HAS GROWN HAS PROVIDED SOME INCREDIBLE MANIFEST YOU BILLS ARE LOWER INCOME IN PARTICULAR- HEALTH PLANS DO HAVE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW PRESCRIPTION BACK THAT. SERVED US BOB THAT'S TO BE INITIATED AND HOW SHE PLAN. ODD YOU KNOW SHARE WITH US WHAT I YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE- THE DELAY THAT ON IS OUR I GUESS IN THE WAR. FOR A CUP OF MONTHS IS UP. CHIU DAHLE HELP AND UP YOU CAN ARGUE US ON MAYBE IT COMES. ANJO WE ARE MAYBE REDUCE THE KINDS. THAT HE ABOUT NOT PLAIN GOING TO BE ON. FIVE HAVE SAID ELSE CURRENTLY PARTICULAR BELIEVE THAT APRIL THE YOU'RE- YEAH SO THIS YEAR YOU THOUGHTS ON THAT BOB CERTAINLY YOU'RE BACK. YOU HAVE MY- BUT I THINK THESE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO ON A RACK NOW. IF OU'RE GETTING THE LET JUST PROPERTY INCOME. THE WILL BE UP. SHE GREW THAT. RIGHT THANK YOU. YES THE DEPART DID- TO THE TRAIN. TO MEDICARE LARACH FROM JAN FIRST TWO TWO. FOR WE REALLY DID IT BECAUSE OF THE KOBE. AROUND THE STATE A CALIFORNIA AND THIS THAT WE CURRENTLY HOW THE IT WAS NAY. TO MAKE SURE THE HOW BILL SYSTEM COULD BUT ARE AT. WERE THAT SURGED- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I PROVIDE WERE BY INFORMED ABOUT THE- GIVEN THAT DELAY WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT PROVIDERS PLANS AND BENEFICIARIES OR WHERE. SO WE DID STILL ON JANUARY FIRST LAUNCH OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER FOR EXAMPLE IT'S LIVE TODAY- WE LAUNCHED OUR PROVIDER PORTAL SO. PLANS PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES CAN GET IN THERE AND GET USED TO WHAT THE SYSTEM WILL LOOK LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T TRANSITIONED. UP WE ALSO. HAVE BEEN ROLLED OVER I THINK WE'RE CLOSE 293% OF ALL PHARMACIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE NOW BEEN ENROLLED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SO. THAT'S A LOT OF- ENROLLMENT. VERY PROUD OF THAT- AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO GET VERYONE IN THE PORTAL AND TRAINED THE NICE THING WITH THE EXTENDED TRANSITION PERIOD IS THAT CAN GET INTO. THE- FOR IT WE HAVE A PROVIDER DIRECTORY ONLINE TO A BENEFICIARY CAN GO IN AND SEARCH WHERE THE PHARMACIES WITHIN OUR NETWORK THEY CAN READ THE MANUAL IF THEY'RE SO INTERESTED IN THAT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DRUGS RECOVERED CETERA. SO WE REALLY TRIED TO EXPAND EDUCATION IN THIS TIME OF THE TRANSITION- AND MAKE SURE THAT PROVIDERS IMPLANTS HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE CAMANCHE. ON APRIL FIRST AT THIS IME WE ARE STILL FULLY ANTICIPATING ON THE APRIL ONE GO LIVE I MEAN WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENGAGE WITH OUR PROVIDERS OUR PLANS AND OUR BENEFICIARIES- TO BE READY FOR THAT TRANSITION. RIGHT GREED HERE THAT AND SHOULD THE PLANS AREN'T ABLE TO HEAR THAT YOU SELL. GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND AGAIN WE ARE A RESOURCE WHENEVER I NEED ASK THAT BUT YOU. IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT OUR STATE. SOME BILLS AND SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO CALLER HEALTHCARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO BATES- SENATOR. THANK YOU MATT CHAIR I THINK THAT ARE OF GOOD- OF ZOOM WITH MISS COOPER. AND RIGHT. JUST GIVEN THE RIGHT THIS OF THE HEARING LET ME JUST BRIEFLY NAMES SOME OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE I THOUGHT SHE HAD A STRONG COMMITMENT BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY BASED MANAGED MEDICAL CARE SHE HAS A STRONG COMMITMENT TO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE AND WORK WITH SOME RECOGNIZED THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST COST EFFECTIVE BUT MUCH BETTER CARE. ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH DISPARITIES WHICH SHE MENTIONED IN HER OPENING STATEMENT HE'S VERY AWARE THAT RATHER THAN JUST TAKING THE SYSTEM AS IT CALMS THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE WORKED. TO BETTER ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND JUST GIVEN THE THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE SHE KNOWS THAT THERE HAVE TO BE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT THERE'S JUST BASIC MANAGEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND SHE SEEMED AS- A WITH THE OVERLAY OF COVERED RIGHT NOW. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A GRASP OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE STRONG A REAL COMMITMENT AND JUST EXUDED CONFIDENCE ALLTHE WAY THROUGH I JUST THINK IT'S GOOD TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD I'M GONNA BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT HER CONFIRMATION. SENATE EARLIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM IN A CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT JUST- JUST ONE REALLY QUICK QUESTION- THE STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY- RELEASE REPORT ON PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS IN PART OF HIGHLIGHTING THE DHS CS IS NOT ESTABLISH ADEQUATE CONTROLS OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE FUNDS. PURCHASE OF IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE AUDITOR'S REPORTS IN WHAT WAYS IF ANY CAN WE RETHINK THE PROGRAM TO BETTER PROVIDE SERVICES. THANK YOU SO PROPERTY SIX HAS BEEN- AN IMMENSE- A PROGRAM IN THE MEDIC HOW. PROGRAMS REALLY BEING ABLE TO GET SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS TO DENTISTS- FOR NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION FOR HOME HEALTH SERVICES IT'S BEEN VERY CRITICAL FOR US TO HAVE AN INCH IMPLEMENT. ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT IS IN ON THE PROP FIFTY SIX IS THE- LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING IN REGARDS TO THE AUDIT REPORT I'M ONE OF THE- CORNERSTONES OF THE PROPERTY SIX DOLLARS IS TO INSURE THAT WE ARE GIVING LOAN REPAYMENTS DEPOSITIONS AND DENTISTS AND- I'M HARD TO ACCESS AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE VERY MUCH DONE SO HOWEVER IT'S NOT THE ONLY MEASURE THAT WE HAVE HAVE USED FOR ON DETERMINING WHICH PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS WE NEED IN OUR PROGRAMS- IT ALSO. OF THE FOCUSED ON CLOSING GAPS ON CERTAIN SUBSPECIALTIES FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE PARTS OF THE STATE WITH VERY LOW ACCESS TO A PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALTIES- HOWEVER THE POSITION MAY RESIDE IN A LARGE URBAN AREA- BUT PROVIDING ACCESS VIA TELEHEALTH AS WELL AS OTHER MODALITIES- TO BENEFICIARIES ACROSS OUR PROGRAM- AND SO WE HAVE LOOKED ACROSS GAPS. ON CERTAIN SPECIALTIES- WE HAVE LOOKED AT YOU THAT GEOGRAPHICAL GAPS- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAXIMIZE AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO UTILIZE THE PROPERTY SIX FUNDS TO. NOT ONLY INCREASE THE% PAYMENTS TO OUR PROVIDERS AND OUR DENTISTS AS WELL AS DIRECT THOSE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS. TO THE MOST NEEDED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. APRIL YOUR ANSWER AND LOOK FOR TO FOR COMFORT. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- MR MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE HOME HOPING IN THE POST COLD WORLD- WE'VE USED TELEHEALTH PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY NOW FROM EVERYTHING I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHAT OPTIONS YOU PATIENTS WILL HAVE WHO ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF TELEHEALTH IN THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT. SERVICE THANK YOU YOU ARE CORRECT WE HAVE SEEN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND TELEHEALTH UNDER CODE NINETEEN- AND THAT IS- THAT IS EXCITING I THINK THAT IT IS A VERY GOOD AND USEFUL MODALITY ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEM SO ACROSS OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- WE'VE EVEN SEN GREAT EXPANSIONS DURING COATED- UNDER THE LONG TERM SERVICES ANDSUPPORTS IN OUR- COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. OF WHICH IS CRITICAL ON THE DEPARTMENT I WILL BE RELEASING A TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL- NEXT WEEK- BURKE CONSIDERATION AND IT IS LOOKING AT EXPANDING AND KEEPING IN PLACE SOME OF THE TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. GIVE ME. THAT WERE IN PLACE AN EXPANDED UNDER COVER NINETEEN INCLUDING ACROSS ALL OF THOSE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THE PHYSICAL HEALTH EXPANSION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPANSION- EVEN LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT- TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT. AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED FOR THAT PROPOSAL TO COME OUT- AND WE DO THINK THAT IT WILL HELP I'M PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR BOTH PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES OF WHILE ALSO- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. CONTINUED QUALITY OF CARE AS WELL AS PATIENT CHOICE WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL PATIENTS YOU STILL HAVE THE ABILITY- TO REQUEST IN PERSON CARE IF IT THAT SO WHAT THEY CHOOSE- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT PROPOSAL WHEN IT IS RELEASED- AND I. IMAGINE IT WILL BE ABLE TO HELP MANY PEOPLE AND INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. LAST QUESTION ABOUT YOUR PHARMACY PROGRAM THE TRANSITIONING. BALL MEDICAL PHARMACY BENEFITS FOR MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE. OBVIOUSLY EVERY MONTH PEOPLE NEED O GET THEIR DRUGS. DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN HOW YOU MAKE THAT TRANSITION HE THOUGHTS ON HOW CONSUMERS WILL BE INFORMED. OF THE NEW PHARMACY BENEFIT BENEFITS AS THEY SEEK TO. YOU KNOW ON EVERY MONTH TO GET THE DRUGS. A MEDICARE ARE EX OF TALKING ABOUT. I'M DO YOU MEAN I'M SORRY THERE WAS A SLIGHT INTERNET CONNECTION I'M SORRY. CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION SORRY FOR SOME REASON THE- IN CONNECTION WAS COMING IN AND OUT I APOLOGIZE SOON SO YOU BROWN'S SORRY. NO THE QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH YOUR THAT THE MEDICALLY TRANSITIONING IN MEDICARE ARE EX FOR PHARMACY PATIENTS AND GOT A MAKING SURE HOW YOU TRANSITION AGAIN WHAT THE INTERFACES FOR THE- SO MANY FOLKS EVERY MONTH NEED TO GET THERE THEY'RE MET THEIR MEDS BASICALLY WHAT KIND OF THINKING HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH RESPECT TO THAT TRANSITION. SORRY YES THANK YOU. SO AS I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT MEDIC CALORIE ACTS IT IS WE HAVE PROBABLY THE LARGEST FOOTPRINT OF ACCESS TO PHARMACY PROVIDERS THAN ANY OTHER NETWORK. SO AS WE TRANSITION ALL INDIVIDUALS FOR MANAGED CARE TO- THE MEDICAL OR EXPERT PLATFORM WE CURRENTLY HAVE 93% OF ALL PHARMACIES IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ENROLLED TO PARTICIPATE. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS ALMOST ALL PHARMACIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE ABLE TO USE TO FILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS- WE ARE REALLY ENCOURAGING PROVIDERS TO GET ON AND ACCESS OUR PORTAL IT'S BEEN LIVE SINCE JANUARY THAT CAN GET ON BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT. WE ARE OFFERING TRAININGS SINCE THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY A NUMBER OF WRITERS TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE- AND SO WE- ARE REALLY ENCOURAGED WITH GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT. WE THINK THAT WILL CREATE GREAT ACCESSIBLE ALSO STANDARDIZED THE PHARMACY BENEFITS ACROSS THE ENTIRE MEDICARE POPULATION. RIGHT NOW DEPENDING ON WHICH MET A MANAGED CARE PLAN YOUR IN YOUR PHARMACY BENEFIT COULD CHANGE VERY IN REGARDS TO THE SERVICES NOW WE WILL HAVE ONE STATEWIDE PHARMACY BENEFIT- WHICH INCREASED ACCESS TO PHARMACY SERVICES THAT WE ARE VERY HELPFUL AND MEDICARE X. COMING LIVE IN APRIL- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PHARMACIES AND PROVIDERS TO MAKE IT AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE- THANK YOU I MISTER. LAY I WANT TO I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION- THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED ITS TWENTY TWENTY PREVENTATIVE SERVICES REPORTERS AS REFERENCED- AND- I. FOLLOWED ALONG I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS I'M PLEASED ABOUT THE REPORT BEING DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT OF PREVENTATIVE SERVICES PROVIDED TO CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. YET IN TWO TO TWO POINTS ONE THE MAJORITY LEADER STARTED. ADDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT RELUCTANT- TO EXPAND THE USE OF TELEHEALTH- PERMANENTLY SO- MAYBE YOU COULD. KIND OF PICK UP ON THAT AND TELL ME HAS THERE BEEN A CHANGE OF HEART IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THERE WAS RELUCTANCE MAYBE. GIVE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE THERE. HAS COULD THINK WE'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TELEHEALTH IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAD. GREATLY EXPANDED OUR TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL EVEN BEFORE COBIT NINETEEN WE HADN'T SEEN THE INCREASE IN ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH SERVICES THOUGH INTEL AND TELL THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHERE IT GREATLY EXPANDED- AND SO NOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS ASSOCIATIONS BENEFICIARIES. A LOT OF PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM MODALITIES THAT SHOULD BE- AVAILABLE IN MEDIC CAL. AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR A PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE RELEASED NEXT WEEK ACROSS ALL THE MENTALITY THAT WOULD INCLUDE SYNCHRONOUS. ASYNCHRONOUS TELEPHONIC AN AUDIO ONLY- AS WELL AS REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO. IMPLEMENT AND IN MEDIC HOW- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE VARIOUS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES WILL BURY ACROSS DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND PROVIDER TYPES AS APPROPRIATE- FOR CLINICAL APPROPRIATENESS. AND THE PAYMENT PARITY OF MAYBERRY ACROSS VARIOUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT TELL HELP PROPOSAL COMES OUT- BUT WE DO. ANTICIPATE IN OUR PROPOSAL YOU SHOULD BE EXPECTING THAT IT WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FROM WHAT WE HAVE TODAY- AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT ARE IN- IN AVAILABLE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THANK YOU MISS COOPER OF THE LAST THING- AS PART OF THAT- REPORT. THE YOUR PREVENTATIVE SERVICES OUTREACH CAMPAIGN OUT WAS MENTIONED- AS IT RELATES TO OUR OUT YOU HAVE YOU SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT CAMPAIGN AND- HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC IMPACTED THIS AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS ENSURING THAT KIDS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WELL CARE VISITS A PREVENTATIVE CARE VISIT. VISITS ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW DURING THIS. TIME SO YES I'D SEEN THE- THE RESULTS. OF THE REPORT AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ERY. WITH MAY CARE- THEY HAVE BEEN DOING OUTREACH THEY'VE BEEN SENDING ON WHAT WE CALL POSTCARDS- TO BENEFIT YEARS MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT PREVENTIVE SERVICES THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE TO HAPPEN. AS WELL AS IF THEY HAVE AN ACCESS THOSE PREVENTIVE SERVICES- I WOULD NOTE THAT- THAT VERY EARLY ON DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE IDENTIFIED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CHILDREN ACCESSING. THAT ONLY CHILD CARE VISITS ABOUT GETTING THEIR CHILD IMMUNIZATIONS IN PLACE- WE STARTED. HAVING CONVERSATIONS VERY QUICKLY IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY- BECAUSE OF THE UTILIZATION DECREASES TO GET THE WORD OUT TO PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND IT STILL VERY CRITICAL TO HAVE THOSE IMMUNIZATIONS TAKING PLACE. WE ARE WATCHING THE DATA CLOSELY WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE NUMBERS COME BACK UP I'M HOWEVER WE ARE STILL NEEDING TO CATCH UP FOR THE MONTHS FROM ABOUT NOON I WANNA SAY WAS AROUND MARCH- ALL THE WAY THROUGH AUGUST SAW SIGNIFICANT DECREASES. COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS AND CHILDREN IMMUNIZATIONS- IN THE END CENTS OCTOBER WE'RE STARTING TO REALLY SEE THOSE NUMBERS INCREASE SO WE WILL BE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH PEOPLE TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. NOW THE OFFICES ARE OPENING BACK UP- AND HAVING AVAILABLE APPOINTMENTS WE DO NEED TO GET THOSE KIDS END OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE RESTARTED ON THEIR CALL CAMPAIGNS- AND OUTREACH TO OUR BENEFICIARIES. WE ARE REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN MAKE UP. FOR SOME OF THAT THAT TIME DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHERE. PEOPLE ARE JUST REALLY HAVING ON TROUBLE GETTING INTO THE TYPES OF VISITS WE'RE OFTENTIMES PREVENTIVE SERVICE VISITS CAN ALWAYS HAPPEN VIA TELEHEALTH A BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO BERRIES COMPONENTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO BE IN PERSON INCLUDING THINGS LIKE GETTING YOUR IMMUNIZATIONS- AND SO WE WILL BE VERY FOCUSED ON GETTING THOSE. NUMBERS UP WE JUST MENTIONED AT OUR AND CHAP- MEETING EARLIER THIS WEEK I'M REALLY FOCUSING AND WORKING WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE COME BACK IN. AND RE ENGAGE IN HEALTH CARE AFTER THE PUBLIC MERCHANTS IN.

I AM HONORED TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD AND TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS DURING THE SOME PRESIDENTE TIME. I WANT TO THANK BRIEFLY MY FAMILY FOR THEIR SUPPORT MY PARENTS AND SISTER I'M ESPECIALLY MY HUSBAND AND OUR THREE CHILDREN. IN MY TEN MONTHS AS A BOARD MEMBER I HAVE DRAWN HEAVILY FROM MY BACKGROUND IN IMMIGRATION LAW REPRESENTING WORKING CALIFORNIANS. FROM THIS EXPERIENCE I TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT EACH CASE I ROLL ON AS A BOARD MEMBER. HAS A REAL LIFE IMPACT ON A WORKER AND EMPLOYER AND THIS IS A CHARGE I DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS AND THE JUDGES AND STAFF THROUGHOUT OUR AGENCY FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. WHEN I BEGAN ON THE BOARD IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAN'T OUR AGENCY% WAS ABLE TO PIVOT. AND CONDUCT ALL OF OUR HEARINGS VIA TELEPHONE. WE ALSO BEGAN HIRING IMMEDIATELY ADDITIONAL JUDGES AND STAFF IN PHASES. TO MANAGE TO INCREASE CASELOAD THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED- ALLEN MENTIONED WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE PIPELINE AND APPEALS MODERNIZATION PROJECT IN UNDER WAY THAT IS EXPECTED TO LAUNCH LATER THIS YEAR AND ONCE IT DOES. ALL PARTIES WILL HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PENDING APPEALS WHICH IS GOING TO BE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS. A FEW OF MY GOALS FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TERM OUR TO CONTINUE ASSURING THAT WE PROVIDE ALL PARTIES WITH FULL AND FAIR HEARINGS AND PROMPTLY ADJUDICATE THEIR APPEALS. TO PROVIDE WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO CLARIFYING GUIDANCE IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE ISSUE. AND TO EXPAND LANGUAGE ACCESS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR MODERNIZED APPEAL SYSTEM. WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH I AM GOING TO START WITH SENATOR BASS. YOUR MATE YES WE CAN'T- BUT SOMETHING BLOCKING MY SCREEN HERE. CONGRATULATIONS MISTER ALLEN AND NELSON- COUNTY MINING- YOU ALL HAVE A AN INCREDIBLE JOB COMING FRIEND OF YOU BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD IDEA EVD AND GETTING YOU IBM HE WAY ALLEN BALLOT IN THIS. VERY VERY ON TRYING TIME. AND YOU HAVE A GUY YOU HAVE HUGE BUT YOU'RE- ARE VERY REASSURING YOU DO YOU HAVE ARE YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO REPRESENTING CERTAINLY THE AGENCY BUT LITTLE SLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN SO. INTERFACE SUCH DIFFICULT SITUATION HIDING WITH THEIR ON AN EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS THAT CENTER I DO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH OF YOU. ARE BASED ON YOUR PRESENTATION AND YOUR EXPERIENCE BUT A QUESTION IT WAS VERY INTERESTING IN ARNOLD'S LOSES THEIR JOB YOU WERE GETTING A BETTER INTENT OF THE MEETING SIR YOU'RE TELECONFERENCING. AND THAT IS EXCITING BECAUSE THAT MEANS THERE'S A REAL INTERACTION DIALOGUE THAT GOES ON AND THAT'S SO IMPORTANT EACH OTHER THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY'RE CARED ABOUT AND NOT THERE THEIR ISSUES ARE REALLY BEING ADDRESSED ON. IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE WAY BUT THE QUESTION IS WILL LET YOU CONTINUE THAT WILL YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF IT MAYBE EXPANDING AT TO ZOOM. ZOOM GIVES THAT TO BACK AND FORTH SEEING PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND NOT QUITE IN PERSON BUT CLOSE TO THAT- CERTAINLY EXPANDS OF THE FEELING THAT OF BEING RESPECTED. IN THE BUREAUCRACY SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL A GOVERNMENT JUST HAVE THEIR THEY NOD THEIR HEAD THAT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THEIR EARS OPEN OR THEIR HEARTS SO. WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS HELLO MORE TELECONFERENCING AND PERHAPS EXPANDING. ON TOO SOON IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. THIS YEAH MAYBE AFTER THE FIRST JOB MARCH ON THE ON THE ANSWER YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF WERE NOT WHAT ARE OUR NEW SCHOOL TO BE WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE NOW WITH THAT'S GOING TO IN THE FEW. BUT I DO THINK THAT AND I DISCUSS ABOUT MODERNIZING THE AGENCY AND BEING- I'M MORE ACCESSIBLE IT'S THE SORT OF THING WHERE WERE OPENED USING ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW- FOR MANY YEARS AT LEAST 70% OF ALL OR APPEALS WERE IN PERSON AND- IT HAS MADE IT NOW MORE ACCESSIBLE WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT IT'S MY FEELING THAT. WE WILL- I GUESS IS TRUE FOR NOT ONLY CAN WE DO MORE THINGS AND DO THEM DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE WE'RE STILL FIGURING THAT OUT BUT THE ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION IS THAT WE ALSO REALIZE THERE'S MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND PROGRAMS AND THINGS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT. WE ARE WE ARE BEING VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN STILL SEE A KEEP A PAPER CAPACITY FROM CAPACITY DO YOU KNOW LOW TECH CAPACITY FOR THOSE FOLKS WE'RE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO USE THE EQUIPMENT THAT OF MANY OTHER CLAIMANTS WILL SO- I'LL I'LL LEAVE IT TO MY COLLEAGUES TO ALSO AWAITING HERE BUT THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MISCON. GO AND BUILD ON WHAT- MEMBER ALLEN SAID AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR BATES. WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WHEN YOU TRY TO LOOK AT THE SILVER LINING OF A SITUATION LIKE THIS. ONE BENEFIT IS REALIZING. ADDITION INCREASED PARTICIPATION WHEN YOU OFFER ADDITIONAL AVENUES FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND SO ABSOLUTELY WE WANT TO CONTINUE EXPLORING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR APPEALS MODERNIZATION PROJECT. AND ONE THING THAT WE KNOW AS WELL FOR SOME PEOPLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE STILL MEANS BEING IN PERSON WITH A JUDGE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE ADDED LAYERS LIKE AN INTERPRETER. SOME OF THOSE THINGS GET LOST IN TRANSLATION WITH THE PHONE- BUT CERTAINLY MODALITIES LIKE ZOOM ARE STILL OFFERING TO PEOPLE ONCE IT'S SAFE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. REALLY BE IN PERSON. WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST HAVE ADDITIONAL AVENUES FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY HAVE. THE OPTION TO DO WHATEVER IS BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR.

HE SAID OF THIS FINGERS CROSSED THAT IT WILL BE ON ON THE ONLINE. BY SUMMER. BUT I THINK THAT WHAT ALSO IS VERY GOOD IS THAT.
