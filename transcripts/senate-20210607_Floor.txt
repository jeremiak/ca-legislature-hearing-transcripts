AS A MEDICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. SHE HAS SERVED IN A NUMBER OF MANAGEMENT POSITIONS INCLUDING WARDEN DIRECTOR OF DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS SHE'S BREAKING A GLASS CEILING SHE WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE ON APRIL FOURTEENTH ON A FOUR TO ZERO VOTE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR LARRY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS APPOINTEE SENATOR DELHI. GOOD AFTERNOON MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. KATHLEEN WHO HAVE JUST GOTTEN A KNOWN- UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE IS A CLOSURE OF- PRISONS RIGHT THE DAY BEFORE. SHE WAS CONFIRMED- BUT SHE GOT HER HEARING IN FRONT OF A- THE OF THE- RULES COMMITTEE SO I WANT% TO SHARE SURE FIRST OFF THANK THE RULES COMMITTEE FOR ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS I HAD THE PRO TEM. FOR MAKING SURE I HAD- THOSE QUESTIONS- IN WRITING TO ME AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT- SINCE THAT TIME. THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH HER AND IF SHE DID NOT INDIVIDUALLY MAKE THESE DECISIONS OVER THEY WERE MADE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HERSELF. AND IT GREATLY AFFECTED MY COMMUNITY SO TODAY I'M GOING TO BE LAYING OFF I WANTED TO SAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN VER OPEN TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE. ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT TO THE WOUNDS TO MY COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN- ARE STILL RAW AND THERE WE ARE LOSING- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A- EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE- LEGISLATORS TODAY THAT- I'LL BE LAYING OFF BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER ON THAT THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GOING TO BE FACED WITH. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEAR WITHIN FIVE YEARS WITH THE RELEASE OF MANY MORE INMATES IN OUR SYSTEM SO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR DALEY CENTER COME LONGER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF THE RULES COMMITTEE I VOTED FOR MISS LLISON BECAUSE I WANTED TO GRANT HER- THE COURTESY OF BEING HEARD ON THE FULL FLOOR I ACTUALLY- HAD A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH HER PRIOR TO THE INTERVIEW AND RULES AND- SPOKE WITH HER FOR PROBABLY. OVER AN HOUR ASKING SOME VERY HARD QUESTIONS- ABOUT CDC ARE- AND WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU KNOW I AM WILL NOT BE VOTING TODAY ON THIS APPOINTMENT- THIS IS MIKE MY CONSCIENCE GUIDING ME IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY ONE PARTICULAR PERSON. BUT IT SPEAKS TO A REAL FACT THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO CHANGE A SYSTEM THEN WE CANNOT PLACATE IT BY REALLY ALLOWING PEOPLE. TO MOVE AROUND MY DECK CHAIRS- ON A TITANIC YOU KNOW CDC ARE IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND IF YOU HAVE READ ANY OF THE ARTICLES IN THE RECENT WEEKS- PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY DYING EMPLOYEES AND INCARCERATED FOLKS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE RE IMAGINE A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT FORCE FOLKS WHO WORK THERE. TO KILL THEMSELVES OR. TO BEGIN TO ENGAGE IN. HARMFUL ACTIVITIES- OF SELF HARM SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE WORKING I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A REAL DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE OF THESE PRISONS. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT BLOOD. THAT SPILLS. IS ON OUR HANDS SO I AM JUST REITERATING THAT THIS IS MY CONSCIENCE SPEAKING TO ME ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND WE ARE ASKING FOLKS TO STEP INTO IT. AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK. AND IT'S THE WAY. I HAVE NO WORDS BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- TO SHARE ASSETS WILL BE SOLD THEIR CONSCIENCE THANK YOU CENTER COME UNDER CENTER CALLED AERO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I'M GOING SUPPORT THIS THIS- APPOINTMENT TODAY BUT I JUST FELT LIKE I HAD TO SAY THAT- THEY'RE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE GOING FORWARD IS THAT WE'VE WE'VE- WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING CDC ARE AND WE'RE CHANGING. THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME BUT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. PRISONS WERE SOLD TO RURAL CALIFORNIA AS A AS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TOOL FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SO. IN MANY IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES PRISONS ARE PAID THE HIGHEST WAGES IN THE REGION WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT WORK FORCE. LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO BECOME PART OF OUR COMMUNITY SO IF AND WHEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE REDUCTIONS IN ANY PART OF OUR PRISON SYSTEM WHETHER THEIR YARDS OR WHOLE FACILITIES ARE CLOSING. I'M I'M GONNA ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH US SO WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING WE CAN PLAN FOR pQUESTIONS AND WE CAN BE RESPONSIBLE LEADERS. AND HELPING OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT AND SO AS I SAID I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS APPOINTMENT AND- AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WE BE. PART OF THAT THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR COME BY- SENATOR NELSON. MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS IS A- AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE IN AN INTERESTING TIME DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I CAN TELL YOU LOTS OF STORIES ABOUT THAT ORGANIZATION AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT IT IS LONG BEEN DYSFUNCTIONAL IN MANY RESPECTS AND IN MANY WAYS. BUT MUCH OF WHAT'S BEFALLEN IT NOW HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND ACTIONS OF GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATORS. AND ON A FEW OCCASIONS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WITH PROP FORTY SEVEN AND PROP THIRTY SIX. AND POLICIES NOW OF JUST OPENING THE PRISONS ALL THE JUVENILE FACILITIES AND WASHING OUR HANDS OF THE- PUTTING ON REHABILITATED FELONS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER LITTLE SMALL ITEMS. CALL THE ACTION PROGRAM LEARNED IT PROHIBITED PERSONS. AT THE END OF THEIR TERM HAVING MADE THAT UP OBLIGATION TO SOCIETY AND JUSTICE. INDIVIDUALS FOR CERTAIN ONES ARE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING A GUN. BUT OUR ATTORNEYS GENERAL I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO THE ISSUE WAS A BACKLOG. THOUSANDS GOSH THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED. DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE WELL I WON'T GET INTO FURTHER ON THAT IS KIND OF A- SOURCE BACK WITH ME. BECAUSE NOBODY HAS JUST ONE GUN. OR MAYBE ONLY A FEW. BUT BACK TO THE SECTOR CORRECTION. CLEARLY IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST APPOINTED JOHNSON. IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND I OPPOSE CURRENT POLICIES RELATED THERE TOO. BUT I'M NOT GONNA ASK THIS SECRETARY. TO ANSWER TO ME OVER THAT. IS NOT HER CALL. AND I'M NOT INTENDING TO VOTE FOR THE CURRENT- AGAINST THE CONFIRMATION I MAY HAVE STAYED. BUT I WANT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT THE- THAT'S A VERY TOUGH JOB. AND THE PEOPLE IN THAT JOB AND I UNDERSTAND SHE'S DONE A LOT OF TIME OVER THERE. AND I POSSIBLY BATTLE THAT MIRACLE SHE MORE THAN ANYBODY IN RECENT MEMORY AROUND THIS PLACE. BUT I WOULD NOT HOLD THAT AGAINST THIS SECRETARY. AND YOU'LL VOTE YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE ON IT BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I LOOK AT IT. THANK. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS APPOINTEE SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I SUPPORTED THIS OF A APPOINTMENT OF KATHLEEN ALLISON. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WE RAN RULES- I JUST. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF LITIGATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID THE FORTY TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST C. C. R. SHE'S BEEN IN THIS JOB FOR LITTLE OVER A YEAR I MEAN I THINK MISTER DE IS JUST RETIRED IN THE MIDST OF CODED- SHE WAS APPOINTED THE DAY AFTER THAT VERY NIGHT BEFORE HER APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATION THERE WAS A RELEASE A PRESS RELEASE THAT WENT OUT THIS IS PRISONS ARE GONNA CLOSE AND- I WAS MADE AWARE OF IT WE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH OTHER LEGISLATORS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF ALLEY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER. BECAUSE IT DID AFFECT OUR DISTRICTS AND WE WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION- WE WERE NOT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AND SO WE DID DISCUSS THAT WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY APOLOGETIC SHE SHE- SAID THAT YOU KNOW LET'S WORK FORWARD ON A BETTER PROCESS SO THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND SHE ALSO HAD GREAT SOLUTIONS FOR FACILITIES THAT WEREN'T- THAT WERE NOT BEING USED BY CDC ARE SPECIFICALLY AFFECTING MY DISTRICT MY CALLING FROM COUNTIES DISTRICT THAT ALLOWED. US TO USE THOSE FACILITIES NOW AND TURN HIM INTO SOMETHING A BIT OFFICIAL USE FOR THE COMMUNITY- TO BLAME HER FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON I THINK IS NOT RIGHT AND THIS ISSUE WITH RELEASING PRISONERS AND DOWNSIZING THE PRISON POPULATION HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE GOVERNOR BROWN AT LEAST- SINCE THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE THROUGH GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEW SEND IT STARTED UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN I THINK IT WAS ADDED TO BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET LAST YEAR ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET WE'RE KIND OF HEIGHT OF CO THE CRISIS. AND THE FEDS ARE THREATENING- IF WE DIDN'T DO DOWNSIZING- IN OUR PRISONS THAT THEY WOULD COME IN AND DO IT FOR US BASICALLY. IT'S KIND OF A- MMHM. YOU KNOW. SMALL CAPTION OF WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON BUT- BASICALLY THAT WAS WHAT WAS GOING ON SO. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HER IT'S NOT KATHLEEN ALLISON IS A SECRETARY IT'S NOT HER ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW I TALK TO PEOPLE IN A CIVIL SHE SHOULD STAND UP TO THE GOVERNOR WILL SHE'S PART OF HIS CABINET SHE'S AN APPOINTEE. AND YOU KNOW WE PASS THAT BUDGET WE AS IN YOU KNOW ALL OF US AND SHE'S JUST KIND OF DOING WHAT THE BUDGET REQUIRES HER TO DO- AND ALSO FOLLOWING THE GOVERNORS EXECUTIVE ORDER SO. AND WELL I SUPPORTED HER IN THE- RULES COMMITTEE. MELISSA THE RESUME THE CONVERSATION TO SEE WHERE THIS GOES BUT- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT KATHLEEN ALLISON'S. FAULT THAT WE'RE IN THE SITUATION WE ARE RIGHT NOW- WITH RELEASING SEVENTY THOUSAND PRISONERS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT FALLS ON THE HEAD OF THIS ADMINISTRATION NOT AN APPOINTEE. THAT TOOK A POSITION LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS NOMINEE- I DO JUST WANT TO FLAG A FEW ISSUES- WHERE CITIES ARE IS NOT DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO AND IS GOING TO BE CONTINUING- ISSUES- THE FIRST IS AND WE WERE WORKING WITH CDCR AROUND THE TREATMENT OF TRANSGENDER. PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WE PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE TREATED MORE HUMANELY AND ON OUR HOUSE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE ON MATTER THAT CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGES- WITHIN CDCR IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF TRANS- PEOPLE- AND STATEMENTS MADE BY GUARDS ETCETERA ETCETERA- AND THAT IS A CONTINUING SOURCE OF TENSION THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY ON THAT. ON WE ALSO SEE SHARKS CONTINUES TO FACILITATE TRANSFERS OF PEOPLE TO OUR USE WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME THEY'VE PAID THEIR PRICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN CITY STARS FACILITATING THEIR DEPORTATION- THAT NEEDS TO STOP WE CALLING ON CITY STARTED US CUT IT OUT TO STOP THERE'S NO LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARDIO TO DO THAT- BUT THESE ARE CONTINUING PROBLEMS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY- TO MOVE TO A BETTER PLACE.

A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ON MAY TWENTY FIRST HE WAS TRAGICALLY TAKEN FROM US AT THE VERY YOUNG AGE OF SIX. BY HIS MOTHER IS DRIVING IN THE KINDERGARTEN THE FIFTY FIVE IN ORANGE. AGENT WAS MURDERED IN A HEINOUS ACT OF ROAD RAGE IN GUN VIOLENCE. THIS MURDER WAS A RANDOM AND SENSELESS. YESTERDAY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ARRESTED TWO SUSPECTS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AIDEN'S DEATH. I KNOW THAT THE FAMILY IS ENCOURAGED THAT JUSTICE MAY BE SERVED BUT THAT OF COURSE WILL NOT BRING BACK YOUNG AIDEN. HIS DEATH HAS ROCKED OUR ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY. AND IT IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME. I DRIVE THAT SECTION OF ROAD VERY OFTEN MYSELF IN FACT I JUST DROVE IT WITH MY KIDS OVER THE WEEKEND. I HAVE A FIVE YEAR OLD WHO STARTS KINDERGARTEN THIS FALL AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MY PAXTON. IT COULD'VE BEEN YOUR KID OR GRANTED IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF US. THIS RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE TOOK FROM US A SWEET KIND BOY WHO IS BELOVED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING WITH AGENTS FAMILY YESTERDAY. AND WAS SO TOUCHED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE YOUNG BOY. HE WAS AN ANGEL. GET A TENDER GIVING HEART AND HELPFUL NATURE ALWAYS ASKING WHAT HE COULD DO TO HELP. EIGHT WAS A SELFLESS CHILD WITH A BIG HEART FOR OTHER KIDS AND ANIMALS. HE LOVED BUGS AND INSECTS AND TOLD HIS PARENTS HE DREAMED ABOUT GROWING UP TO BECOME AN ENTOMOLOGIST. HE ALSO LOVED MUSIC AND DINOSAURS AND OF COURSE LIKE ALL OTHER SIX YEAR OLD BOYS I THINK. HE WAS ALL ABOUT POKEMON AND COULD TALK YOUR EAR OFF ABOUT CHAR'S ARDS AND LEGENDARY POKEMON. AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT US ADULTS CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. LIKE ANY OTHER SIX YEAR OLD HE WAS EXCITED BECAUSE HE JUST RECEIVED A NINTENDO SWITCH WHICH WAS HOLDING. WHEN HE PASSED. MOST OF ALL HE LOVED HUMANITY AND WAS FILLED WITH JOY LOVE AND KINDNESS. HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND CARING ABOUT OTHERS AND ONLY WANTED TO SEE THE HAPPINESS THAT OTHERS COULD BRING TO THIS WORLD. RECENTLY HIS MOTHER TOOK HIM TO A PARK. WHERE THEY'RE BUNCH OF CHILDREN PLAYING. WHEN A CHILD WAS APPARENTLY ARTISTIC. AND FLINGING HIS BODY ON THE FLOOR AND SCREAMING I DON'T WANT TO TALK. THE OTHER KIDS ALL NOR THIS YOUNG CHILD BUT EIGHT IN ALONE WENT OVER TO HIM. KNELT DOWN AND SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK. AND THEN OFFERED IN HIS HAND. AND THIS WAS THE TYPE OF HUMAN BEING THAT EIGHT AND ONCE. HE WAS KIND THOUGHTFUL AND SO LOVING TO OTHERS. WE HAVE LOST THAT LIGHT AND ALL OF THE POTENTIAL HE HELD. TO DO THIS RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE AND ANGER. OUR HEARTS BREAK FOR THE LOSS SUFFERED BY AIDEN'S FATHER JOEY. IS MOTHER JOANNA. HIS SISTER ALEXIS AND ALL THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE TOUCHED BY THE LIGHT AND KINDNESS THAT AIDEN BROUGHT TO THIS WORLD. ORANGE COUNTY IS A WORSE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF IT IN THE US.
