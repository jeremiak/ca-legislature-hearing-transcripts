ARE LIKE TO THE SPA. PLANNING AND CONSERVE WE FOR MARCH SEVERAL OUR STATE TALK SECRET PRACTICE. BOTH WHO REPRESENT THE DEVELOPERS THE IN MARIN CA THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THE- FROM THE SCHOOL THE VARIETY A WIND SWATH OF PRACTICE BACK. ARE AN ORGAN A FOR BY WHICH THESE ARE PARTIAL. WERE ABLE TO THE MEASURE THAT IS YOU TODAY. AND I AM WANT. TO PARENTHETICALLY IN THE THAT I HAVE BEEN ON TO WHERE TO IMPROVE. THE EFFICIENCY. AND THE- THAT SHE WHAT. THE KID MATTERS ARE GOOD GALA ON IN COULDN'T TO BUT THEM OF MANY YEARS AND HAVE PREVIOUSLY TO GET STATE. TO TALK ABOUT THERE IS A COMMON OFFICE AND NOW I WE'RE COULD MAKE SURE SHE COULDN'T TO DIDN'T IT WAS TO ALLOW THE PUB TO. IN MAY DOES. AFFECTING THEIR CA. WHILE AT THE SAME TO WHAT WE TO SURE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE KINDS OF THE- AND GAMES WHEN. THAT THE PER THAT HAVE LED TO SOME THE- IT. AND THE LADY SO. WITH IMPORT FOR OUR SO WE KNOWS QUIT THE CORE. OF CAL ARE FAR MENTAL POLISH. FIFTY YEAR FROM ITS MY THE LAW REMAINS A FOR AND- PROTECTION AND FOR. INVOLVED IN PROJECTS BY LAW FOR ON THEIR BEHALF AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. THE STATUTE HAS STRONG. SOME OF IT MAY. AND SOME OF IT. THIS BILL IS PREMISED ON THE I. THE MEANINGFUL SALUTE CAN BE FOR THROUGH COLD EFFORT IN ORDER MOVE PASS HELLO THE V. AND HARD FOSTER. IN THAT IS PREDICT THERE ARE THOSE ARE OUT THERE THAT SEAT SHE WHAT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WITH IT THEY LIKE TO TELL AND INDEED ANY EFFORT GET THE KIND OF PART TO. AND FRANKLY ARE GOOD TO INVITE POLICY AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO FOR IT CAN BECOME AND TO BE WORKED. AND THE THERE ARE THOSE USE ARE TOO MANY TO WOULD BE. ARM IT IS MY THAT THE ALLEGIANCE AND I THIS IS A BILL IN. IN PRAGUE BUT IT IS MY HOPE THE THIS BILL ADVANCE CHAU IMPORTANT SOLUTIONS. ALONG STATE SINGLE CONCERT. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL ADDRESS THE LARA THE CRY ISSUE OF DOCUMENT DUMPING WE'RE SOMETIME THE ADOPTION OF AN FOUGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS OR DELAYED WITH LATE WRITTEN COMMENTS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL AGENCY RESPONSE BEFORE FINAL ADOPTION OF THAT REVIEW CAN PROCEED. THIS BILL EMBODIES THE SPIRIT OF BALANCED AND FAIR PROCESS BY ALLOWING AGENCIES TO ELECT AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS WHEREBY THE AGENCY PUBLISHES ITS FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THIRTY DAYS BEFORE ADOPTION AND SUCH A DEADLINE. FOR WRITTEN COMMENTSUP TO TEN DAYS BEFORE ADOPTION. THIS COMPROMISE PROVIDES THE PUBLIC GREATER TIME TO REVIEW THE FINAL DOCUMENT AND ALLOWS THE AGENCY AMPLE TIME TO RESPOND TO ANY FINAL COMMENTS WHILE STILL KEEPING THEIR ADOPTION SCHEDULE ON TRACK THIS IS CRITICAL THAT WE KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING THERE ARE THOSE WHO CLEVERLY ARE ABLE TO DELAY IT. DISCOURAGES AND THAT IS NOT INTENDED NOR IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN FACT THIS BILL TRIES TO REMOVE THOSE KINDS OF THE LADIES ARE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING THE GOALS OF THIS MEASURE. TRULY IT BRINGS GREATER EFFICIENCY TO THE SEQUENCE PROCESS BY DEVILISH OF WORK FOR A IN PARTIES AT THE OUTSET OF LIVING. TO MEET AND DISCUSS THE LEDGER OF HOW THAT MADE FOR. AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF SETTLEMENT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF INFORMATION HEARINGS THROUGH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SEARCH OUR THAT HAVE CRIED TO WITHDRAW. HOW WE CAN A THIS LIVE ROOM. WE AFTER A- THE SEQUEL THE ONLY WAY TO WORSE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB ACT IS THROUGH. IT THE REVENUES IT IS A LITTLE PATIENT THE OR DIRECTED PROCESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO EXT PROCESS WHAT YOU DO TO ENCOURAGE. THIS OFFER. I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE SO AT ANY RATE WE HAVE A JUDICIAL PROCESS. AND ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO WITH THIS MEASURE IS TO ENCOURAGE BUDGET MEETINGS BETWEEN THE PARTIES SO THAT THE CORD AS SHE BEGINS THE PROCESS CAN SIT DOWN WITH THE PARTIES AND TRIED TO ENCOURAGE MEDIATION SETTLEMENT RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS IN AN EARLIER MANNER AND IN THAT PROCESS DURING THESE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE EXPERTS. IN THE COURTS TALK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT THESE VARIOUS KINDS OF EARLY SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES AND SO FORTH HELP HELP TO RESOLVE ANY. ISSUES IN A MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUS AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IT TRIES TO STRUCTURE THESE MEETINGS IN A SENSIBLE WAY TO INVITE EFFICIENT JUDICIAL PROCESS WITH THE GREATER POSSIBILITY OF SETTLEMENT VERSUS CONTINUED LITIGATION. THE BILL SUPPORT SUFFICIENT PREPARATION OF THE RECORD I ALLOWING AGENCIES TO ELECT. AN ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD UPON NOTICE OF A JUDICIAL FILING SO LONG AS THE AGENCY BEARS THE COSTS THAT PROVIDE CERTAIN. AGENCIES LAW PROVIDING PETITIONERS WITH RELIEF FROM SIX SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COST ALSO THE BILL ALLOWS LITIGANTS IN LOW POPULATION COUNTIES TO SEEK A BENEFIT OF EXPERT JUDGES IN OTHER VENUES AND TO SUPPORT OUR LONG TERM EFFORTS TO BRING MORE SEEK WHAT EXPERTISE TORONTO STATE COURTS SYSTEM. THIS BILL THUS REQUIRES A SCHEMATIC REVIEW OF SHE QUIT EXPERT JUDGES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MOST AFFECT THE- DISH READ VERSES WEAKENED LOOK AT LEGISLATION THAT WILL SEND THESE MATTERS TO. SHE JUDGES IN AN EXPEDITED FASHION WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CANNOT COMMENT THEY DON'T EXPECTATIONS AND THIS BILL HELPS ACROSS THIS AND IMPORTANTLY THIS BILLS SIX A SOLUTION LONG BYE ARC. THIS FRANCHISE FROM WAS PUBLIC SAYS TO LET BETTER HERE'S- SO THE GRIP IN A SECRET IS THE IN FOR I PROVIDE TO COME PROJECTS APPROVED ON BEHALF OF THOSE. BUT IF THEY ALREADY IT'S FROM THAT A FROM DUE TO LOW A LACK OF LANGUAGE ACCESS WE UDERMINE THE IMPORTANT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES THAT ARE EMBODIED IN SHE- AND IN ALL OUR- STATE POLICY MORE LARGELY. SO WE KNOW OUR STRENGTH IS IN OUR DIVERSITY AND ARE RESIDENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS I MIGHT INDICATE THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO AN AMENDMENT THAT THAT WILL REDUCE THE- TRANSLATION RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE BASIC ONES REDUCE COST REDUCED HARM. THIS WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED BY. OUR VERY STE LOCAL AGENCIESWE'VE TAKEN THAT AMENDMENT- AND- I BELIEVE WE STILL HAVE RETAINED THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION TO ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT. THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDE PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPORTIVE IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR ON IN UNDER HOUSE CALIFORNIANS BY ESTABLISHING AN EXEMPTION TARGETED FOR THOSE CATEGORIES OF HOUSING NEED AND AGAIN WE TOOK THE AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES THIS. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS OF GREATEST CONCERN HERE IN OUR STATE AND FINALLY. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE QUESTION IN THE ADOPTION OF PROJECTS THROUGH THE LOCAL ELECTIONS PROCESS- THE BILL AFFIRMS THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO VOTE ON ALL MATTERS OF COMMUNITY CONCERN BUT IT ALSO WEDNESDAY ABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT APPROVAL INITIATIVE. THAT IS QUALIFIED FOR THE NEXT BALLOT TO INSTEAD BE DIVERTED FROM THE VOTERS AND DIRECTLY ADOPTED BY LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODIES. AS THE ANALYSIS INDICATES WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE- TO ACCOMMODATE THIS AND- CERTAINLY- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THIS THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE THAT PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT PRESERVES. THE INTEGRITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACTED SO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT BRINGS ALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER. TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PROCESS SO AS YOU CAN SEE BRINGS UP FORWARD SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT IN THEIR TOTALITY MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON IMPROVING SEEK ON SEVERAL FRONTS. IN A BALANCED MANNER WHILE PRESERVING THE STATUTES FUNDAMENTAL TENANTS- AND- I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE LENGTHY ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE SHE- IS A BOTH A BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WHY MY INSPIRATION TO FIGHT TO THE FIRST SEQUEL CAME FROM. AN EXPERIENCE I HAD MANY YEARS AGO A BEING FROM THE EAST COAST WHEN IT GETS COLD A LOT OF PEOPLE GO DOWN TO MIAMI BEACH. AND I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE ONE YEAR AND I HAVE TO SAY I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR SINGLE BECAUSE IT HAS. KEPT CALIFORNIA FROM LOOKING LIKE MIAMI BEACH- THE OUR GROWTH. IS RECENT OUR GROWTH RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED TO DO MORE DEVELOPMENT BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THOSE. CRITERIA AND THAT'S WHAT SHE BUT HAS BEEN FOR US FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. SO WITH THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE BRINGING THE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE. ACTING THE ENTIRE AND SHE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHILE EXPEDITING IT AND MAKING IT A MORE FAI AND BALANCED PROCESS. AND TO ASSIST WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WITH ME TODAY.

THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THE MOMENT OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS NOW BRINGS THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE ALL OF OUR WITNESSES ON ON ON CALL WE'VE GOT A COUPLE PEOPLE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. IN FORTY TWO OR THREE SO I QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I CENTER WITH CASKEY. I APOLOGIZE THAT I WASN'T HERE AT THE INTRODUCTION AND- I WANT TO. APPLAUD THE AUTHORS HERCULEAN EFFORT TO COME FORWARD WITH A- A BILL LIKE THIS SOAP. SO COMPLEX AND- OBVIOUSLY INTELLECTUALLY DEMANDING AND NEW ONES. ON THE- FROM THE STAFF REPORT I'M LOOKING AT THE- VOTER INITIATIVE. REVISIONS AND I WOULD LIKE TO BENEFIT OF HER THOUGHTS INTO THE STAFF REPORT CAME IN HI. SURE ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THE HOW THE INITIATIVE PROCESS MAY BE CHANGED WITH REGARD TO SEE CA. AND THE BEST. WE CAN HAVE ON MUTE OKAY JUST BECAUSE OF A FEW. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE THIS IS THE TWELFTH JOBS LOOPHOLE I THINK THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO- SO IT'S LONG BEEN ESTABLISHES YOU KNOW THAT SHE WILL REVIEW IS NOT REQUIRED. WHEN VOTERS TO DOT THE LOCAL INITIATIVE THAT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT. BECAUSE THE DISCRETIONARY DECISION IS MADE BY THE ELECTORATE RATHER THAN A LOCAL AGENCY. BUT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THE PTOLEMY JOBS AND SMALL BUSINESS ALLIANCE VERSUS A COURT CASE- WAS FOR. IT HELD THAT SHEEPLE ALSO DOES NOT APPLY TO LOCAL INITIATIVE POSITION OF PETITIONS THAT ARE SIGNED BY TRUST 10% OF THE VOTERS AND THEN DIRECTLY ADOPTED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY RATHER THAN BEING SUBMITTED TO THE ELECTORATE AT THE ELECTRIC. THIS ARE UNINTENDED LOOPHOLES LOW HAS BEEN USED BY PARTIES WITH DEEP POCKETS AT THE BY PASS SEQUEL DENYING THE PUBLIC THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN MAJOR LAND USE DECISIONS SO. THE WORDS ARE THEY GO OUT THEY GET 10% OF THE PUBLIC TO SIGN ON TO. A FREQUENTLY. WITH EXPLAINING IT SOMETIMES OF COMPLICATED THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GIVING THE A SIGN OR- THE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND HEN WHAT THEY DO IS THEY SAY OKAY NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE VOTER THE LOCAL AGENCY- THE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL CAN MAKE THE DECISION AND THAT CIRCUMVENTS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. THIS BILL SB NINE FIFTY WOULD CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OPS TO ADOPT THE INITIATIVE RATHER THAN TO SUBMIT IT TO THE VOTERS THE NINE FIFTY WOULD ENSURE SINGLE STILL APPLIES. IF THE- THE INITIATIVE IS SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS EXISTING LAW STAYS THE SAME SEE WHAT WON'T APPLY BECAUSE THE VOTERS HAVE HAD THEIR SAY NOW- IN THE DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THE- COMMITTEE. I IS ONE I THINK WHERE WE SHARE A COMMITMENT TO FULLY CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES SO THAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. IS CLEAR AS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF SHEBA- BUT THERE ARE SITUATIONS- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE EXEMPTIONS ARE THE PREFERRED ROUTE. OF FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXEMPT THE PARTICULAR CATEGORY- ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND HOUSING PROJECTS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SHOULD QUALIFY FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE SEVERAL EXEMPTIONS CURRENTLY IN LAW AND MAY QUALIFY FOR FUTURE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS WHAT WE WANT TO DISCUSS AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO. DISCUSS GOING FORWARD IS ARE THE BEST WAY TO DEFINE WHAT. THOSE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND- PROJECTS MIGHT BE A SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED TO CREATE AN EXEMPTION BUT TO LEAVE THE- OVER TO CLOSE IF YOU WILL THAT SEQUEL LOOPHOLE AGAIN IT ALLOWS REALLY DEEP POCKETS TO COME IN AND TO CIRCUMVENT THE SINK WILL PROCESS. THE BUT THE AND THAT IS NOT WHERE WE ARE I THINK WANT TO SPEAK WITH TO GO CERTAINLY THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE NOTION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS IS VERY PHILOSOPHICAL ITS IDEOLOGICAL. ANY THE FOLKS WHO OPPOSE. SHE WHAT ARE IN THIS BILL WILL OPPOSE SINGLE. I AND SO WE'RE NEVER GOING TO. IN A WE'E NEVER GOING TO APPEAL TO THEM WHENEVER GOIN TO SATISFY THEM AS LONG AS THERE IS A SEQUEL- BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE BILL IS FIND THAT BALANCE. AS WE HAVE SEEN. AND MANY OF US pARE PROBLEMS WAS SHE BORN AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND- FRANKLY BRINGING THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER ACTUALLY. THEY BROUGHT THEMSELVES TOGETHER- BUT FOR YEARS AND I KNOW CENTER WHAT CASKEY YOU BEENACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS AS WELL. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO TIGHTEN UP SEEK WATCH TO AVOID THE KIND OF ABUSES AND MISS USES THAT HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. OUR AND CERTAINLY THE STRONG THESE ARE CASE IS ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES WHERE- WE NEED TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AGAIN WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY DECIDE WHAT EXEMPTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AND TO CREATE THOSE EXEMPTIONS ARE TO FURTHER GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE TIME CONSTRAINTS WE WERE NOT INJURED SURE COMMITTEES I WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- IS. BY MEET AND CONFER CONFERENCE THE INITIAL CASE MANAGEMENT- THE YOU'VE AGREED TO WORK TO SIMPLIFY THOSE REQUIREMENTS OBVIOUSLY I WOULD. I WOULD GUESS THAT. THE IDEAS CAN WE REACH. ABBAS DISCUSSIONS FROM RECENT COMPROMISE WHAT IS YOUR- IF. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. STILL CHAIR TO. THE TRUTH ON SIMPLIFYING THAT THAT LITIGATION. FOR PUT THE PANEL THAT YOU WORK WITH. WELL AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT SIMPLIFYING THIS PROCESS THAT HAS HAD YEARS OF DISCUSSION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY FRIENDS OVER THE CHAMBER NOBODY GOT BLINDSIDED ON THIS THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. IN FACT AS I MENTIONED SEVERAL YEARS AGO I CONVENE THE MEETING OF ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS WHO WANTED TO JOIN US AND WE HAD ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE IN ONE OF OUR- HEARING ROOM SAID ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY OR THIRTY GROUPS. ARE ON THE PHONE AND TALKED ABOUT AREAS WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME TO COMMON AGREEMENT A LOT OF THEM REVOLVED AROUND STREAMLINING THE PROCESS. AND THAT WAS. RESULTED IN A BILL I DID A FEW YEARS AGO ON. AT PRESIDING THE OB PREPARATION OF THE RECORD- PUTTING MORE OF THE INFORMATION ONLINE. THE DOCUMENT DUMPING ISSUE WAS RAISED THEN WE COULDN'T COME TO ANY KIND OF ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION FOR ALL THE PARTY SO WE- LEFT THAT OFF OF THE THAT LEGISLATION. BUT THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE CONTINUED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME I'VE HELD AS RICHARD JUDICIARY IN NUMBER OF HEARINGS. ON THIS THE USUAL SHE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME WE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT. HOW ONCE THEY GET THE PARTIES TO THE TABLE. IN THAT COURTROOM SETTING. IN MEETINGS IN CHAMBERS WITH THE EDGES ARE AND I MENTIONED THAT A JUDGE ROBI IS A HAS BEEN SORT OF THE LEADING EXPERT ON THIS SHE IS DISCUSS WITH US. WAYS TO EXPEDITE NOT ONLY EXPEDITE THE PROCESS BUT TO REACH RESOLUTION IN SETTLEMENT AND I BELIEVE THE INDEX DID AND I MAY BE WRONG. SOMETHING LIKE 96% OF ALL THESE CASES COME TO FOR THE- THAT ARE. SETTLEMENT FUNDS. SO AND THAT SETTLE IN. I IN DO. AND NOT. IN APPROACH. WAY AND NOT WITH THE GAME PLAYING AND EXTENT. AT OUR- WHAT IT IS TO. THIS TURNS WITH JUDGES WHO ARE EX IN FIELD REALLY GET THE TO THE TO TWIST THEY ARE AS A NEST HAVE TO DO TO REACH A RED. AND THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND YES MANY MANY OF THE BILLS THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN HEADED A SOMEWHAT ATTENUATED PROCESS- AND I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE OF THESE BILLS IN THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSING BILLS IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. BUT NONE OF THESE ITEMS. ARE ANYTHING NEW. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO WORK PRIMARILY ON THE- SHE GENERAL ASPECTS CLOSING LOOPHOLES ARE REMOVING THE POLITICS AND GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN IMPROVE UPON IT AND I BELIEVE ADDING OF THOSE ELEMENTS THROUGH THE COURTS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS WHILE RETAINING ITS SUBSTANCE AND- SOME DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT INITIAL MEETING. TO DISCUSS THE PASTA ATTENTION FOR A SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE THAT WOULD BE WITH THE JUDGE IN A SORT OF A THREE WAY OR JUST A TWO WAY. THREE WAY. WELL I DON'T KNOW I THINK HAVING HAVING THE COURTS HAVING A COMPETENT QUALIFIED EXPERTS SHE WHAT JUDGE. IN THE PROCESS- OF IT I THINK. WE'LL HELP EXPEDITE IT WILL IT WILL LAY OUT THE WHOLE PROCESS VERY QUICKLY IT WILL RESOLVE ANY OF THE DISPUTES THAT THAT MAY EXIST HE SAID SHE SAID. THE COURT CAN CUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER AND SET UP A PROCESS AND IT IF MISTER RUSSO FIVE. IF THEY'RE SO I MISSING HERE PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO. WITH THROUGH THE CHAIR INVITE MISTER MOOSE JOHN WELL YOU JUST COMPARE WITH US AGAIN I'D LIKE TO. IF I COULD FOCUS EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY TO WHICH THE REPRESENTS PATIENTS MAKE PREVIOUSLY. ARE THE PRACTITIONERS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE CHAMBER OR THE BUILDERS TYRONE THAT THE- WATER AGENCIES ARE TOLL GATE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN THE UP IN THE. IN ORDERTHE- IF YOU WERE FOR ON THE STREET WERE ISSUES COME TOGETHER OUR SIX IN THE- IN A- SORT OF NON. WAY BUT IN A REAL PRACTITIONERS WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT RESULT IN THESE EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. WHEN NO DEVELOPMENT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT BECAUSE OF THE GAMES THAT ARE PLAYED BY WHATEVER GROUP WHETHER IT'S A COMPETITOR YOU KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS THAT THERE ARE. UNNECESSARY DELAYS BY BRINGING THE COURTS GENERALLY WE'RE GOT WHAT THE GOAL IS TO GET RID OF THOSE UNNECESSARY DELAYS. OKAY MISTER MISS VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN AND THEN IT'S GONNA SEND OUT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE A TECHNICAL ANSWER TO HOW THIS PROCESS WORK RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW THERE'S A INITIAL REQUIREMENT FOR A MANDATORY SETTLEMENT MEETING. IN OUR COLLECTIVE JUDGMENT ITS CURRENT TOO EARLY IN THE PROCESS THE PARTIES AREN'T PSYCHOLOGICALLY READY SO WE TRANSFORM THAT INTO SORT OF THE LAWYERS TOUCHING. BASE AND THEN THE NEW ELEMENT WOULD BE A MANDATORY CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE WHERE THE JUDGE INTERVENES EARLY IN THE CASE GETS THE PARTIES TALKING ABOUT MOVING THE CASE ALONG QUICKLY GETTING THE RECORD READY. THERE'S A HAVE TO HOPE THAT THE PARTIES WILL STIPULATE TO A SMALLER RECORD TO KEEP THE CASE MOVING MORE QUICKLY THAN THE FORMAL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE WE COME A LITTLE LATER. LET'S PEOPLE HAD TIME TO CALM DOWN AND OUR STATE A LITTLE BIT LATER SETTLEMENT CAR. ACTUALLY BE MORE LIKELY. TO RESULT IN SETTLEMENT BUT THE MAIN THING IS GET THE JUDGES INVOLVED EARLY IN THE CASE TO. GET IN ON THE RADAR SCREENS GET THIS BREAKING SCHEDULES- SAID REALLY. THE HOPE OF JUST GETTING THROUGH LITIGATION MORE QUICKLY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THE RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE HELPFUL THANK CENTER DOLLY. THREE YEARS CHAIR OF I'VE THAT WE HAVE ADAM ON THE A- WHEN A SERIES WHICH IS OFTEN HERE OF COMMENTS HIM ABOUT THIS SELECT. PLEASE BOGO OKAY AND DIED SO MISS REGULARLY I AYE MAYBE WANT TO RISK TO THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE. SURE THAT I'M ON THE LINE AND THERE WAS A LOT TO UNPACK THEIR I THINK I NEED TO SPELL. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE SENATOR THAT THEY'RE SOMEHOW OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE- QUOTE UNQUOTE EIGHT PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE TO HELP. FIX THE ISSUE THAT THE PERENNIAL PEOPLE ISSUES IN THE CAPITAL AFFECTING STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FOR YEARS. THE NOTION THAT. JOINT HEARING ON THE BECAUSE SOMEHOW. EIGHT MEN OR AN EQUIVALENT TO HOLD STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHERE WE ARE NEGOTIATING AMENDMENT TO A CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL STATUTES THAT WILL IMPLICATE EVERY HOUSING I'M JACK EVERYTHING THE LAND USE PROJECT- CUSTOMIZED- IS NOT THE SAME HAVING A HAND SELECTED AMOUNT OF PEOPLE PRACTITIONERS WHICH BY THE WAY THE ONLY DEVELOPER SIDE REPRESENTATION RELYING FROM OXFORD. SO EVEN THAT SMALL STAKEHOLDER GROUP CANNOT BE ARGUED AS A ROBOT- STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WITH ALL INTERESTS REPRESENTED AND THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE. DEVELOPERS UNION AND OTHER FOLKS ALL OF HOLDING YOUR BILL SHOULD HIGHLIGHT THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS WITH THE BILL AND THAT IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME. AND I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST MOVING OUT OR MOVING I SHOULD SAY- CHANGING HOW WE DO CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE THE- THERE ARE BIGGER. MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN THIS BILL AND IT WAS BEING SOLD AS A FEW QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT BALANCE IS. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INTEREST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A ROBOT. PACKAGE EQUALLY BALLOT WE'RE HERE AND OPPOSITION REFLECT IT IT IS NOT BALLOT AND THERE IS A WHOLE LOT MORE FOLKS EITHER SUPPORTING AMENDED. OR POSING AS AMENDED ORCHESTRATE OPPOSING THERE ARE JUST STRAIGHT SUPPORTERS NINETY THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF HOW IT BÃO THE BILL IS. THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE MOVIES OUT OF COMMITTEE ON THE HOPE TO JUST WORK ON THE NET. COULD FUNDAMENTALLY IMPACT HOW CALIFORNIA GET OUT OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN MY OPINION IT'S HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE GIVEN WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FULLY ENGAGE THE SAME WAY IN A FULL LEGISLATING PROPER THANK YOU SIR ARTS CENTER HELP. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR CHAIR THE THANK YOU TO- TO SENATOR JACKSON BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND- HAS FELT THE PAIN OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN- THAT ARE BROUGHT EVERY TIME ANYONE TRIES TO BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF SEQUEL REFORM SO I RESPECT HER AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I I'D WOULD TAKE AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS THAT- ANYONE WHO IS OPPOSED TO SEE CLOVER DOESN'T LIKE SEQUEL A- TWO STEP AND WANT TO IMPROVE IT THAT IS ONE OF THE LAMINATED OR GET RID OF IT OR KILL SEE CA AND IT I THINK THE REALITY. IS FOR THE YEARS. EXPERIENCE WILL LIVE WITH IT AND OF. IT TO AS AS A CAL I CERTAINLY HAVE BUT I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE. IN PLACE IT IS HERE FOR A REASON AND- THE EFFORTS ARE TO TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER TO WORK BETTER TO STREAMLINE IT SO THAT IT IS NOT AT. A CUMBERSOME PROBLEM- IT SO IT IN TO ME I LOOK AT IF WE WERE TO IF THE A GOAL IS TO STREAMLINE AND MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER AND IMPROVE IT. MY CONCERN IS IN LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION READING THE OPPOSITION LETTERS. AT THE OPPOSITION COMING FROM ALL SIDES I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST. IT'S ANYONE WHO IS A SEQUEL A- WHO'D- WITH SECRETIVE WHO. EMPLOYMENT SHE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WHO IN I'M&lt;/c&gt;</u> NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WORK SEE WHAT THEY DON'T USE IT NEEDED TO AN HOUR USE IT AND- AND TRY TO IMPLEMENTED ON A DAILY BASIS. NO ONE IN NEWS GROUPS THAT- HAVE ANYTHING ARE ARE SUPPORTING THIS OR ARE FEELING THAT THE CHANGES THAT ARE. QUITE A FEW. ARE OFFERING A SOLUTION TO SEEK WITH THEIR ALL OPPOSED TO IT AND THAT'S WHERE THE TROUBLE COMES FOR ME IS IF WE'RE NOT MOVING THIS BAR THE BALL FORWARD IN IMPROVING AND REFORMING IN ANY LIGHT. THEN WE'RE JUST CREATING MORE OBSTACLES IN OPPOSITION FROM EVERYBODY THAT THAT WERE SEEN SO. I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I CAN'T VOTE FOR- BECAUSE OF- OF THAT AND- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY OR NOR TIME THAT IT CAN BE IMPROVED IN THE NEXT- OF NEXT MONTH BASICALLY A MONTH AND A HALF SO I CAN'T SUPPORTED THE BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE- OF. THE WE'RE NOT SEEING THE REFORM THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATE MCGUIRE. A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHAIR THE INCREDIBLE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE A AS WELL AS SENATOR JACKSON FOR THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS BILL LEADING INTO TODAY- AND RESEARCHER TRULY APPRECIATE IT NOW THAT IT IS BEEN A LOT OVER THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS. AND I BELIEVE THE MORE WORK IS GOING TO BE NEEDED ON THIS BILL- AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE BILL- BUT I WANT TO RESPECT THE COMMITTEES PROCESS SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION TODAY KNOWING KNOWING THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO NEED TO BE REFINED- HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS AND WHETHER IT IS HERE IN THIS AND THIS IS FOR YASSER IS A WHOLE NOTHER HOUSE IN FRONT. OF THIS BILL IS WELL AND- WE NEED TO BE A TO GO THROUGH THAT COMMITTEE PROCESS IN MY BELIEF NEEDING TO BE REFINED SO SUPPORT THE BILL- IN KNOWING THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO COME THANK YOU SO MUCH. SURE WITH TENDER AND I AND EIGHT EIGHT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR- THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE SOME I WILL SAY- I A- I A HERE AND SHARE SOME OF THE- OPPOSITION CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN REYES I WILL SAY I THINK AT LEAST A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIVELY. ADDRESSED BY THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS AGREED TO- YOU KNOW THE AS SAID TO GIVE ANYONE WERE TO GO THROUGH THE TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THAT. HAS ME HAS SOME. ALSO AGREED. TO THE- IDEA TO. WORKING WITH US ON. I ON ON NOT SIR TEN HOUSING TO REACH CERTAIN STANDARDS OF FROM THE TAMI JOBS FIX IT TO CALL SO I THINK I'D BE MUCH HARDER TO CALL THE SENATE AND ANTI HOUSING BILLS A RESULT OF THAT CHANGE AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHERS AND I'M HAPPY TO GO OVER PEOPLE WANT CLARIFIED CLARIFICATION BUT- YOU KNOW I'LL STAND THIS IS BEEN A BILL THAT AND HAS CERTAINLY. STRUGGLED FROM. YOU KNOW FROMFROM FROM FROM THE ALL THE DIFFERENT RESPECT. BECAUSE THIS IS A DIFFICULT AREA TO MAKE ANY CHANGES IN HAND- I CERTAINLY RESPECT THE pYOU KNOW MAKE IT IS A SERIOUS ATTEMPT HERE- AND SO I'M CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR TODAY- BUT I ALSO YOU'RE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERN SO. THAT'S MIND THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS AND WITHOUT I AM A SURGEON THEIR COMMENTS FROM- FROM THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE SENATE THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO IN JANUARY ALL THE OPPOSITION IS SUPPOSED TO SEE WHAT I THINK IT'S- WORKS IN A- VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE. SAID TO IN FACT I WOULD RATHER SHE SHE WILL GO AWAY- BUT THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS ADDRESSING THEM WE'VE TAKEN SOME STAND AMENDMENTS. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE BEING THOSE DISCUSSIONS- THE NOTION THAT THIS IS MOVING TOO FAST WITH TOO MUCH TOO SOON I JUST WILL HAVE TO SPECULATE DISAGREE WITH. THESE ARE THIS BILL IS CULMINATION OF YEARS OF WORK. WORKING OFF OF THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSS WE HAD SEVERAL DAYS AGO OUT WORK NOT FOR NUMBER IT MUST. WE'RE JUST EARINGS. GOING WAS BECAUSE IT IS SO. BECAUSE IT IS SO CA BUT GOAL HERE IS HOW DO WE MAKE IT BETTER THE THIS STATE. GROUP ARE HAS BEEN A GROUP THAT I SHOW I DO. A PRACTICE ON ALSO THAT WANTED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS IMPROVE THE RESULTS ARE AND- CERTAINLY WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS- I'M HOPING FOR MISSIONAL SUPPORT WITH THE PAYMENTS THAT WE ARE. HOPING TO TAKE THIS IS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK IT A CRITICAL TIME AND CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WHERE WE CAN BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET I LOOK FORWARD TO. I HEARING. SOME CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE CHAMBER AND THOSE IN OPPOSITION- TO ADDRESS- THEIR CONCERNS ARE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE SHE QUIT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU LOOK AT HAT SOME OBJECTIONS PARK. FACT AND SOLUTIONS TO ACTUALLY. WE HEAR THAT FOLLOW. I AM SCHOOL IF THAT. IF THE AGENTS ALSO TO SPEND EIGHT EIGHT. TO OUR THE TWELVE LOOP WHICH OF CAN WERE WORKING ON THAT ARE THE DOCUMENT DUMP WE'VE HEARD SOME SHOULD DOESN'T FAR. AND YET IT DOES ALLOW FOR PUBLIC. WHICH IS CRITICAL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DEALING WITH AN ISSUE WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY. IN ONE OF THE- MECHANISMS BY WHICH DELAY HAS BEEN ARE ENCOURAGED. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE USUAL BONDING THERE WAS SOME OBJECTION THAT THAT. WOULD INCREASE THE COST WE ARE TAKING THAT OUT OF THE BILL SO MY HOPE IS MY REQUEST IS THAT WE ARE A LOT OF THIS BILL TO KEEP MOVING THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT IS LONG OVERDUE OR THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT IS A CULMINATION OF MANY YEARS OF DISCUSSION- AND- I'M- I. AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN. COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT ARTICULATED OTHER WITH THE SAME TIME STILL PRESERVE SHE CAUGHT. I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE GROUPS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION. LEGITIMATELY WANT TO PRESERVE SEQUEL BUT HAVE SOME. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCERNS THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE I AM VERY OPEN TO THAT. AND APPRECIATE AGAIN THE GOOD WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT THAT THIS THIS BILL WILL GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND PROCESS- IF IT.

AB NINE HUNDRED SUNSETS ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO DATE EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED HAS RESULTED IN A LEAST TWELVE SEPARATE MEGAPROJECTS REPRESENTING OVER TWO BILLION IN INVESTMENTS IN OUR STATE. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH. THESE PROJECTS HAVE PROVIDED OVER TEN THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS AND CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW HIGH WAGE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMANENT JOBS. THIS BILL EXTENDS AB NINE HUNDRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND EXPERIENCE IT SO THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO MUCH SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS. WE'RE CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED LAW NOW SAYS ONLY PROJECTS OF A HUNDRED MILLION OR GREATER OR ELIGIBLE. SB NINE NINE FIVE LOWER SET THRESHOLD TO FIFTEEN MILLION SO SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS QUALIFY. SB NINE NINETY FIVE ALSO REQUIRES THAT PROJECTS HAVE AT LEAST 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT THEY WILL BE INFILL PROJECTS AND THAT THEY MEET SPECIFIED LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.

I IN TWO OF THE GOVERNOR- WHEN HE MAKES A CERTIFICATION ON THESE LEADERSHIP PROJECTS AND THEY ARE LEADERSHIP PRIDE PROJECT SO- HE I'LL GET AND I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE WAS C. YOU'VE PICKED A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT I WAS HOW WAS THAT ARRIVED AT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS COULD GENERATE A LOT OF. CHECKS IN IN THIS IN THIS FIELD- THIS THE FIRST QUESTION OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WE CASKEY WHAT WE HOPE IT GENERATES PROJECTS FRANKLY- THAT'S THE THAT WAS THE POINT TO EXTENDING TO OF US FOR THREE WHOLE TEEN. AT BEST AS ARMS. YOU KNOW THE LARGE PREY UNDER THE A. B. NINE HUNDRED- WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF THOSE PROJECTS WHICH I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR BACKUP- IS THE ISSUE HERE AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION OTHER COLLEAGUES. WAS THE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE BENEFITTED FROM A. B. NINE HUNDRED BECAUSE OF THE SCALE OF THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE AND IT IS BILLION SOME PART IT'S ABOUT SECTION OF HOUSING AND INCLUDE. HAVE DIFFICULT IT'S NOT PART OF YOUR- AB NOT HUNDRED BILLION. HOLE ALSO ABOUT PARTS OF OUR THAT HAVE BEEN A TAX THAT AND THAT OP. LIKE HE- OUT AT PROVIDE. OPPORTUNE SO IN AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE IN IN MANY CASES SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL AREAS. THIS IS NOW A TOOL THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE OUR TO SUPPORT- DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING- AND SO. THAT WAS THE THOUGHT THAT WENT BEHIND IT SENATOR WIECKOWSKI YOU ONE NIGHT AND CENTER HERE OLD CALL HERE IN TWO THOUSAND LEVIN WE VOTED ON. A. B. NINE HUNDRED. OUR INTEREST AT THAT. WOULD THESE. EGGS IN MARCH PROJECTS THAT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND THRESHOLD IS ONE IS ONE THING BUT YOU KNOW OUR THINKING AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT THEY WERE LEAD CERTIFIED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE- ENERGY EFFICIENCY LEVELS. THE STAFF REPORT HAS SEVEN PAGE ELEVEN MAKES SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS ON AMENDING IT TO MODERNIZE SAID WITH THE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL- UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE TODAY THEY WERE DEMANDING OF YOU KNOW THE OAKLAND AIDS PROJECT WAS NET ZERO- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS. ON PAGE ELEVEN. FIVE EXCELLENT QUESTION- WE CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE ARE FOR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SMALLER PROJECTS THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BILT INTO THAT THAT AS WELL IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMATIC LIKE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MODERNIZE STING THE IT'S BEEN A DECADE SINCE AB NINE HUNDRED ALMOST. WE DO WANT TO TAKE. MORE THAN TWO FIVE TALK TO- STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ARE STILL IN CONVERSATION WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ON THAT ISSUE AND I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO THAT AND CAN POSSIBLY INCLUDE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. TO APPROPRIATIONS AND INTO EMBLEY IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND- CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIR. AB I SAID THIS IS SOMETHING WE% NEED TO CONSIDER YEAH I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISPARAGING COMMENTS ABOUT STATE SPORTS STADIUMS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DOWN HERE AND THE PROJECTS THAT KING MAN THAT WENT TO THIS COMMITTEE ON WHAT TO JUDICIARY. YOU KNOW THE PROJECT TWENTY CENT REDUCTION AND VEHICLE TRIPS WE HAD- THE COME OVER TO OF THE BILL THAT CAME THROUGH AND IT. HOME REDUCTION SO- HOPING THAT BECAUSE THIS. HE THE DEPARTMENT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT WANT TO HAVE. THE OFFICIAL PLEASE WE- FOR NOW THAN WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND IN IN WOULD OF BE MAY. A SHOULD BE EASILY TO BE ADOPTED- THIS IS THE SINGLE REFERRED HERE THERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION IF THIS WERE BEFORE THE JUDICIARY WHICH OF LUCK- I'M JUST HAPPENED TO BE A MEMBER WE WILL BE ASKING ABOUT THE TAX ON THE COURTS. AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS AND- SET THIS BUT DE M. SAFI PORT TALKS ABOUT THE TO BENEFITTED WHETHER. CANNABIS DAYS OR REAL DAYS WHEN WE GET TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DAY EXPEDITED- AS- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OVERLOADING THE COURTS- WITH. ADDITIONAL CASES ESPECIALLY WITH THE THRESHOLDS THAT YOU HAVE THE HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. WELL I WOULD AGREE THAT WE WANT OUR COURT SYSTEM TO OPERATE IN A FAIR AND EVEN MANNER HI. AND I THINK- WHEN IT COMES TO- TO THESE PROJECTS. IT OUT THE ORIGINAL PROJECTS AND I WILL. AGREE WITH YOU THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS COULD OPEN THE DOOR TO MANY MORE PROJECTS. BUT AT THE SAME CONCERN WAS RAISED OUR ORIGINALLY UNDER AB NINE HUNDRED- BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN BUT MOST LITIGATION WAS RESOLVED QUICKLY. PROJECTS NEVER EVEN IF IT UP IN THE COURTS- ARE BOTH CURRENT LAW AND MY MEASURE WILL GIVE LATITUDE TO THE COURTS TO MANAGE THEIR CALENDARS AND PROCESS THESE CASES. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MUCH LIKE WE DONE AB TORRENT. HUNDRED AND PROJECT. CAME TO THE TERM WHAT THE EXPERIENCES AND WE CAN. YEAH WE CAN ADJUST OUR AND OF COURSE OUR COURTS HAVE ALWAYS NEEDED- INCREASE FUNDING AND SUPPORT. BY THAT WILL NOT CHANGE IN THOSE OF US WHO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR FUNDING FOR THE COURTS WILL KEEP DOING THAT. I ALSO I JUST WANNA IT TO YOUR LAST QUESTION A POINT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OF THE MEGA PROJECTS AS AS THEY'RE SOMETIMES REFERRED. BY ANY INVESTMENT THE STATE IT WAS TWO BILLION DOLLARS BUT OF THOSE PROJECTS. NO WE LOVE TO TALK THE STADIUM ARENAS PEOPLE'S MENTAL I'M ON THAT. I JUST WANT OUT WE GET FIVE THE NUMBER OF THE PRICE SAID. THE HEADLINE BUT- IN CENTER HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO YOU. OF THE THREE OF SO YEAR FOR TREVOR- POWER STATIONS- TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND NEW UNITS I MEAN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT MEGA PROJECTS WE REMEMBER THAT THIS PROJECTS WERE ALSO ABOUT HOUSING. LOWERING THE THRESHOLD WHILE I UNDERSTAND IN THIS IS NEW TERRITORY AND NEW GROUND FOR US. I HOPE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE PROJECTS IN YOUR DISTRICT MISTER DALI. AND IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MONITOR IT AND IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DAYS CALENDAR DAYS VERSUS BUSINESS DAYS. THAT IS SOMETHING WILL TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL AS THE ISSUES THAT THE COMMITTEE BROUGHT UP. IN TERMS OF CONCERNS- THAT WE LOOK AT AND WHETHER WE DO AMENDMENTS IN THE MODERN IS TEN PIECE OF WHAT'S RECOMMENDED. BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE THINGS MOVE FORWARD WE WANT MORE CLARITY NOT LESS I AGREE. BECAUSE THE STAFF REPORT POINT CITED. AT TWELVE AS IT WAS ARE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ONCE TALKS ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE CLARITY OF MAKING SURE WE GET. WE KNOW THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS HE CREATED IN THE PROJECT ONCE IT'S COMPLETED. AND THE OTHER- RETAIL SPACES THAT THAT MAKES AGAIN IF WE WERE LABELING THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP PROJECT SO. HI FI A HOPE FOR. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT WE CONSIDER THE REDUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCIES THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE BUILDING AND THE ACTUAL- LEED CERTIFIED LEVEL DEAD DEAD WITH THEIR SMALL IN- SIERRA COUNTY OR BIG IN SAM AT AND SAN DIEGO THEY HAVE THERE'S A THERE'S A STYLE THERE'S SOMETHING A SIGNATURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUTS ON THESE PROJECTS THAT SAY THIS IS THE TYPE OF. ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP PROJECT WE WANT TO SEE HER A BILL BECAUSE AT THE END OF MY QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER. PLEASE SECURE BE BRIEF I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO PRETEND ON THE CLAMOR PROCESS THAT SHE IS ESTABLISHING THIS. BRINGING TOGETHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE HAD CHALLENGES TO PREVIOUS HOUSING BILLS IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO SUPPORTED THE PREVIOUS HOUSING BILLS IN HOW TO BE A TO BRING FORWARD A CONSENSUS DRIVEN PROCESS. TO BE GET SOMETHING DONE THIS YEAR AND FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH A COMMITMENT. IN THE SENATE BUT ALSO TO THE REST OF THE CALIFORNIA AND CANDIDLY THIS WILL BE. ONE OF THE BOLDEST PACKAGES THAT WE'VE SEEN RELATED TO HOUSING IN ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ERRORS THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY. IN THE ERA. OF THIS THIS- THE OTHER IMPORTANT DE THIS IS IT THIS WILL CREATE THAT THE HIGHEST MANDATORY STATEWIDE AFFORDABILITY. REQUIREMENT ENACTED INTO LAW. WHICH IS CREATING NEW FIFTEEN PERCENT. MINIMUM WHEN IT COMES TO- AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO FOR DEVELOPER RECEIVED A STREAMLINED PROCESS THEN THEY HAVE TO BUILD AT MINIMUM 15% THAT'S JUST. FOR OBVIOUSLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD GO HIGHER THAN THAT I JUST THINK THATIS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL HI TO COME WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING OUR PROCESS. AND I THINK IT WAS MISS CABALLERO THAT SAID THIS- IN THE WORKING GROUP SHE SAID WHAT'S GOOD FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES WHEN IT COMES OF STADIUM PROJECTS SHOULD BE GOOD FOR WORKING FAMILIES. IN CALIFORNIA'S MIDDLE CLASS AND I THINK THAT. THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES JUST THAT JUST ONCE A THINK IT THE PROTEIN HER PARK BECAUSE RICHARD. THANK YOU CAN ACQUIRE. SO I AM I CERTAINLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENTS YOU'VE JUST MADE ADD TO BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO TO CENTER WILL CASKEY- I THINK. IF YOU KNOW WHEN A. B.

THANK YOU- WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR CENTER HELL TO ADD ON- BUT IT DEPRECIATED. I'M ART ON. THANK YOU ONE THE MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR THIS IS SB TEN FORTY FOUR WOULD SENATOR ALLEN. SENATOR PLEASE PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB TEN FORTY FOUR PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE SALE AND USE OF CERTAIN FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS THAT CONTAINS THE CHEMICALS PER AND POLY FLORA KILLS SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS P. FUSS. HAPPY FATHERS ARE LONG LASTING CHEMICALS THAT BUILD UP IN OUR BODIES IN THEIR LINKED TO NUMEROUS HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING CANCER DAMAGE TO THE KIDNEYS AND LIVER AS WELL. P. FIVE ARE ACTUALLY HARMFUL TO INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND CAN CAUSE DAMAGE THAT LASTS INTO ADULTHOOD. AND THAT THESE pCHEMICALS HAVE BEEN USED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THEY'RE IN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS CARPETS CLOTHING OTHER EVERYDAY MATERIALS THAT ARE RESISTANT TO SHEET STEENS AGREES AND WATER. AND IN A PART OF THE VALUE OF THE CHEMICALS IS THAT THEY'RE SO STATE. BUT THAT THE COURSE BECOMES ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THE CHEMICALS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO STABLE THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN THE END UP ACCUMULATING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND IN THE END UP INOUR BODIES AND IT TURNS OUT NOW SO WHITES THAT NEARLY EVERY PUT. AN EXPOSE AS TO THESE CHEMICALS I SOMETHING LIKE 98% NOW I HAVE P. FIVE. CAN IN THERE HE'S AND- ALSO KNOWN TO CONTAIN. DRINKING WATER ON THE COUNTRY. THE OF FIRE FIGHTING PHONE THAT'S BEEN USED TO FIGHT LIQUID FIRES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF THIS CONTAMINATION AND ENDS UP IN THE ENVIRONMENT SEEPING INTO THE WATER. AND NOW RECENT STUDIES SHOW ON THAT AND SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE. OUR OUR HAVE THEIR WHAT. CAN TO. BY P. FIVE. AND WE ALSO KNOW. THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO THIS TYPE OF CHEMICAL ARE- OUR MEN AND WOMEN. WHO ARE. FIVE YEAH THE EYES IT IS FAR ARE ENDING RISK OF DEVELOPING HEALTH PROBLEMS- AND WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT ELEVATED LEVELS OF P. FIVE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE BODIES OF FIREFIGHTERS PUTTING EVEN GREATER RISK OF HARM INCLUDE. FIVE THERE'S BEEN-VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT ON IN THIS AREA HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND WE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A MOVE ON THIS UNTIL WE UNTIL OUR FRIENDS IN THE FIRE FIGHTING COMMUNITY FELT COMFORTABLE ULTIMATELY SO MUCH OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH PROTECT THEM BUT OUR FRIENDS THE FIREFIGHT THE WORK CONSISTS POLICE INITIALLY BRIDGE THAT FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT DOING SOME WORK IN THIS AREA THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE. TOUGH COMFORTABLE. WE WERE TO MOVE FOR ON A BILL LIKE THIS THERE WOULD BE ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY ULTIMATELY CARE ABOUT FIGHTING FIRES THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR MEMBERS- HEALTH OF COURSE WANTED 2% BUT YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY PETE ARE LONG TERM THE PROBLEM IS BY NOT HOW GOOD IT. THERE IS A- I CAN IMAGINE THAT ARE FOR THE FIRE pCOMFORTABLE THAT I ANY MOVEMENT IN THIS AREA WOULD NOT HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY FIGHT FIRES THAT PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE RISK TO THEIR LIVES AND HEALTH AND OF COURSE TO THOSE OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT- BUT THE THING. THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND REALLY GOOD ALTERNATIVES HAVE EMERGED. HI AND YOU NOW HAVE. YOU KNOW- FAUCET WOULD COURSES OFTENTIMES USING AIRPORTS AROUND THE WORLD WELL- BEEN OF HEATHROW AIRPORT AND HAS BEEN HAS TOTALLY PHASED OUT P. FIGHTS ALL THE MAJOR AUSTRALIAN PARTS. FEES UP TO US FOR THE REASONS THAT WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED OTHER YOU UPDATES ALREADY ENACTED LAWS THAT BANNED MOST USE THE P. FILES CONTAINING FIREFIGHTING FOAM AND THEY'VE MOVED TO ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE FAR SAFER. AND SO BILL ADDRESSES TWO SOURCES OF P. FIVE CHEMICALS BY BANNING THE USE OF FIRE FIGHTING FROM CONTAINING P. FIVE SIX. SITUATE WORDS FINALLY RIGHT THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN WEEK WE WANT TO END UP. CONFLICT FEDERAL LAW. HE'S IN THIS AREA YOU TO DRESS OPPOSITION. WE RECENTLY AMENDED THE BILL TO PERMIT THE USE OF P. FOSS FIREFIGHTING PHONE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE WAS AN ISSUE. THAT COME UP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE GIVE THEM A LONG. A RUN TIME. TO TRANSITION. I HAD A CHEMICAL PLANTS FUEL STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FOR. AN OIL REFINERY SO WE WE'VE PROVIDED SOME FLEXIBILITY- FOR LARGE ATMOSPHERIC STORAGE TANKS- YOU KNOW WHO MAY HAVE FIRES AND IN THOSE AREAS WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE. THE ABILITY OF WRITERS IN THOSE FACILITIES TO FIGHT FIRES. NOW I. JUST TALKED TO CENTER DOLLAR THE OPPOSITION COALITION SINCE. CUSTOMER OFFICE YES YESTERDAY. WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN A PRELIMINARY- LOOK AT THEM BUT I WILL YOU KNOW IS A BLAST IN A REQUEST. WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM- YOU KNOW WE- WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO- GET TO SITUATION WHERE SIGNIFICANT COSTS. ARE ADDED TO THE BILL GIVEN THE CURRENT OUT OF IT FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT IS IMPACTING THE STATE BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK I'M A- VACATIONS BILL TO DROP IN THE CAN. THE BEEN RAISED FOLKS FOR WAS BY OTHERS AS LONG AS IT DOES. HARM MARK GOAL HERE WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT- THAT WE PROTECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH- BUT BUT CERTAINLY- THE A TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. FLEXIBILITY WHEN THEY'RE EVEN WHEN THERE IS IN A STRONG- ALTERNATIVE- TYPIFIES YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WORK WITH THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME. MUTUALLY AGREEABLE LANGUAGE. AND AS I CONTINUE TO REITERATE OUR FRIENDS IN THE FAR FIND COMMUNITY. WE KNOW WOULD NOT BE AS INVOLVED IN HELPING TO PASS THIS BILL. IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL AS THOUGH IT WAS BOTH IMPORTANT FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH BUT ALSO FOR FIRE FIGHTING. AND SO THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS DO ANYTHING THE HANDER- OUR OUR FIRE THERE'S ABILITY TO FIGHT FIRES FIVE YOU RIGHT NOW. HI TODAY WE THE P. FIVE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF ASTHMA IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION AND KIDNEY AND LIVER DISEASE THESE ARE SERIOUS UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE ALSO TOP OF MIND RIGHT NOW THESE DAYS GIVEN THAT THEIR- YOU KNOW THAT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER RISK SEVERE ASSERTED ASSOCIATE COVERT. ADDITIONALLY IT'S FOUND THE P. FAST CAN REDUCE ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO VACCINES. AND THAT'SCERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WERE YOU KNOW IS OF CONCERN- GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW OUR RETURN TO NORMALCY RIGHT NOW IS IT SEEMS TO HAVE JOHN. THE DEVELOPMENT- AND WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF A OF AN EFFECTIVE COVER NINETEEN VACCINES SO- IT'S OUR FEELING THAT THE TIME IS CALM FOR US TO STEP UP PROTECT OUR FIREFIGHTERS PROTECT OUR CHILDREN OUR ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITIES. FROM THIS UNNECESSARY SOURCE OF P. FOSS EXPOSURE AND WITH ME ON THE LINE I REPRESENTING OUR FIREFIGHTERS IS THERE AND WHEN HE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIREFIGHTER HE'S CONTEST. SUPPORT I DEREK'S TESTIMONY.

NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND AN OCCUPATION THANK TO DOUBLE CANCERS AMONG FIREFIGHTERS. ANSWERS ONE. THAT I WANT TO WORK. ELEVATOR LEVELS OF CANCER EXPOSURE TO COST IN A ARE SUCH THE INTERNET AGING FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER. ACTUALLY CLASS FIREFIGHTING ACOSTA CARCINOGENIC OCCUPATION. THE BEST SCIENTIFIC MINDS IN THE WORLD SUSPECT BUT OUR LINE OF WORK CAUSES CANCER. MANY CRAFTY FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS AND EIGHTY FIVE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO SEVERAL CANCER. AND A VARIETY OF OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE MORE RESEARCH ON THEIR PART LEADING DP EQUIPMENT WHICH WE THE WHY DID OUR JOBS. YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE CAMELS. CAMPBELL'S AFFECT NOT ONLY FIRE. BUT EVERY MEMBER OF EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE. WE FIREFIGHTERS BOYS BUT OUR DUTY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FIRST. EDUCATION WERE REPEATEDLY EXPOSED TO CONDITION INCREASE OUR RISK OF BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ONE DAY.

HERE ASSN OR DOT TO PRESENT SB NINETY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE AND BY THE WAY. I JUST WANT TO JUST JUST FOR FOLKS TO KNOW BECAUSE WE WILL JUST TO GET SOME CLARITY ON THIS THIS IS AT THE FIRST OF TWO BACK UP GENERATOR BILLS THAT WE HAVE. COMMITTEE TODAY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THE BILLS- I BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE ON THE BUT I DO I THINK THE AUTHORS AND STAPLES FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO FINDING OUT FOR IT I. FIRST GONNA COME. THANK BUT DOWN. SENATE NOT OF CYNICAL IN AND CERTAINLY GOT THE COMMITTEES AS WELL AND SOME OF THE STATE. GREAT THANK BOB PLEASE TO PUT TO TEN NINETY NINE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ALONG WITH SENATOR GLAZER. SOME TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO COLLABORATE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. I BELIEVE THE PROPOSED- APPROACH IS MEANINGFUL AND I WILL BE EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AS A WILDFIRE SEASON GETS WORSE IN TERMS OF TOTAL ACREAGE AND IMPACTS WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE REQUIRED CALIFORNIA'S INVESTOR ON THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO IN CORPORATE. PUBLIC POWER SAFETY SHUT OFFS INTO THERE WALL FAR MITIGATION PLANS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF POWER LINES AND ANY OTHER UTILITY EQUIPMENT. THE FIRE BECAUSE CRITICAL FACILITIES BE LIABLE POWER PROVIDE CENTRAL SERVICES DIFFERENT ELECTRICAL PROVIDER TRIGGERS A P. S. P. S. THE OPERATORS THESE FACILITIES MUST. UTILIZE THEIR EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERAL. I'D OFTEN. SERVICE OUR STATE MEDICARE DESTROY RESTRICTIONS FOR SOME GENERATORS THAT WERE DOT TRY TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PS PS IN THESE- RESTRICTIONS DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME FOR PROPER TESTING IN ADVANCE OF THE PS PSP VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; OR OFF RUN TIME FOR&lt;/c&gt; SEX THE SEASONS. PS BUT- ALL THIS COAST AIR MAY DISTRICT HAS A RIGHT TIME RESTRICTION OF TWO HUNDRED HOURS PER YEAR IN OUR BASE LIMITATIONS FOR TESTING AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE BACKUP GENERATORS THE BILL WOULD COMMITTEE. FOCUSES ON THE AIR DISTRICTS EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP A STIPULATED ORDER OF ABATEMENT A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEIGHBOR DISTRICTS OF FACILITY OPERATING A STATIONARY. BUT POLLUTION SOURCE. THERE THERE ARE CONCERNS AT THIS BILL WAS UNNECESSARY WELLNESS TRUE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN WHITE THEIR OF DOBBY WIDESPREAD FIGHT FOR NOTICES OF VIOLATION RELATED TO EXCEED AND SAYS THAT'S FAR. THE TAX APPEAR YES OUR TOTALLY PREDICTABLE IT'S FOOLISH TO WAIT FOR DOES THROUGH THE STRAW. THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THEIR CONCERNS AND I'M COMMITTED TO FINDING A PROCESS THEY CAN. PROVIDE CERTAINTY. PLEX ABILITY FOR ALL THE PARTICULARLY WE HAVE HAD A CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH HOSPITALS. TO WORK ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS CENTER GLAZER MY JOINT AUTHORS ON THE PHONE TO CALL. HI DEAD CHAIRMAN ALAN CAN HEAR ME. THANKS AGAIN OKAY YEAH VERY GOOD WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE STAFF IS CENTERED ABOUT AS INDICATED WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK SENATOR DOT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. IT WAS THROUGH THE WAY OF CENTER REQUIRE IN. RUBIO THROUGH. THIS THAT THERE ARE BILLS THAT WAS SUGGESTED THAT ARE BILLS. BE COMBINED. I'D BECOME A CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL AND I THINK THOSE SENATORS FOR THEIR- THEIR WORK AS WELL. THE BILL THAT IS BEING ABSORBED INTO SENATOR DODD'S BILL WAS MY SB EIGHT OH TWO. AND THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS TO TAKE UP. A MAN BE GUILTY IN THE LAW. WHETHER BILLS CAN RUN GENERAL. OUR BLYTHE GENERAL DURING THESE POP PAST. AT ELEVEN EIGHT THAT THAT. I THAT REALLY WAS THE GOAL IS A WAS CA. TO APPLY ONLY B. LIMIT CIRCUMSTANCES OBVIOUSLY CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE HOSPITALS BUT THESE PS PS COME STANCES THEY'RE LIKE DISASTER BEING CREATED WHEN YOU SHUT DOWN THE POWER AND BY THE WAY. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLS WERE IMPACTED. BY FIRE AND POWER OUTAGES THIS PAST YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACCORDING TO THE- THE- YEAH TOP THIS OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO THAT. THAT IS A COMPLETE DISASTER FOR A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM LIKE A HOSPITAL SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR A NEARLY CRAFT. ABILITY TO OPEN EIGHT EIGHT UTILITIES SO THAT THEY THEIR GENERATORS KNOWS UNIQUE I'M STATUS WHICH WE ALL HOPE DECLINE RIGHT HIS WERE ASKING THE POWER COMPANIES TO HARDEN THEIR GRID. AND TO HAVE THESE SAYS A THESE ARE YES IT'S AGAINST A DECREASE AND HOPEFULLY BE ELIMINATED BUT- WE HAVE NARROW. IN WHAT. PLAYER THAT. SO I JOIN SENATOR DIED IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE HASPROPOSED BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT. WON THE RACE IS THIS ISSUE OF RETIRING NARRATORS. I KNOW THAT IS A LONG STANDING. GOAL FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS AND I APPRECIATED AND I UNDERSTAND WHY- BUT THAT IT THIS THIS. LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU IS NOT PLACE TO HAVE THAT DISAGREEMENT OR TO RESOLVE THAT DISPUTE. POST AND DIED AND I ARE WE TRIED TO. WORK IN A VERY NARROW SPACE OF CRISES FOR THESE. IMPORTANT FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS AND WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND THAT REALLY WAS THE NARROW GOAL OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY I WANT TO THANK. CENTER OUT IN FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF WORK BUT MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT IS THAT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY AND I HOPE THAT IT DOES. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO. STAYING THE- RED. OF THE BOOKS. THAT SEEKING IN THIS BILL. AND AS YES THANK YOU THE THANK YOU SENATOR AND YOU KNOW I THINK PART OF SAYS YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL BEEN AND INVOLVED IN THIS INTENSE CONVERSATION AS YOU KNOW- YOU CAME IN WITH A BILL THAT WAS VERY SPECIFIC TO. THE HOSPITAL AND OF COURSE SENATE DOT HAD A AT A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND SO- WE'VE BEEN TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOME CLARITY HERE WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. PERCENT RATIONS ARE UP TO CONTINUE DURING. THIS PS BOB WHILE TIMING. AS AS AB IMPOSSIBLE I MEAN MY FIRST. YEAH THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK HERE'S PGD RIGHT I MEAN THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WERE SITTING DOWN THE POWER AND INCLUDING SITUATIONS WERE VOTER HAVEN'T USE GENERATOR SOME IT WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THEM ON THE HOOK. FOR THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY THE JAPANESE WHICH WHICH ARE SERIOUS POLLUTANTS AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT THAT FROM POSITION. WHO IS ABOUT TO COME UP SO NGUYEN ASTRI THAT WELL I'M SORRY SO WE HAVE OTHER FOLKS TO ONE OF MY VOICE SUPPORT STRUCTURE.

LOCAL DURING THAT EVENT WHAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE WATER FLOWING AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE FIREFIGHTER THAT CAME ACROSS THE DRY FIRE EMERGENCY GENERATORS. WERE THE KEY AND MAKING OUT OFF THE BALL AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL BUT I WILL SAY IT WOULD NOT WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE ACTIVATED A COMBINATION OF STATIONARY GENERATOR AND ALSO DEPLOYED PORTABLE ONE OUT THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICT. WE ARE GOING TO THE FIRE FRONT. WE CALLED FOR MUTUAL AID AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE GENERATORS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OUR FIELD EMPLOYEES- WE'RE WE'RE HEROES IN THE RESPONSE AND THEY HAULED THAT WE'RE TRAILER MOUNTED. OVER MOUNTAIN ROAD WITH NEAR ZERO VISIBILITY INTAKE BLACK SMOKE. AND DEALT WITH DOWNED POWER LINES THE BLOCKED THEIR WAY. ONE EXPERIENCE WE HAD IS A PORTABLE GENERATOR THAT WE HAD RECEIVED FROM A NEARBY CITY BOB TRAIL DURING THE FIRE AND IT HAD ON FORGING NOT BEEN WELL MAINTAINED. WE FOUND REPLACEMENT FROM THE FRESNO AREA BUT WE COULD NOT GET THAT REPLACEMENT EMPLOYEE AND HOOKED UP AND OPERATING BEFORE. WE LOST CRITICAL WATER STORAGE AND A PORTION OF OUR SYSTEM THAT WE CALL THE I'M ALL. SUBSYSTEM ABOUT THAT TIME WE ALSO HAD A BRIDGE FAILURE OF MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY I'M AN AVERAGE WHEN IT FAILED IT KNOCKED OUT ONE OF OUR KEEP WATER MAIN. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THOSE TWO EVENTS YES WERE AUTHORIZED WHICH ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP IF YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND. ALL RIGHT AND WE GOT. WATER ORDER THAT COULD HAVE IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO SERVE WATER IF IT WITHIN YOUR MESS BOB THE OPPONENT ABOUT THE TEN NINETY NINE OKAY THE DEBATE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WE'VE LIVED THROUGH.

HM NO WAY NASRI AND- ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION. SB TEN NINETY NINE. I DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND WELL THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF BACKUP GENERATORS OPERATING DOING PS PS OF AND OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCIES PROVIDE NECESSARY POWER. WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT OR EVEN. PROVIDING YOU SENT SERVICE. GO WITHOUT POWER DUE TO ANY OF OUR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS HAVE AN ESTABLISHED TRACK RECORD TO ENSURE THE LOCAL POWER REMAINS AVAILABLE DURING EMERGENCIES AND TODAY THE BILL SUPPORTERS HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED A SINGLE INSTANCE OF AN AIR DISTRICT SPENDING AT CENTRAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM OPERATING BACK OF GENERATED ANALYZE YOU USE. IN RESPONSE ACTUAL EMERGENCY. IT TO THE TIME ALREADY THEY FOR USE OF BACK GENERATORS EXEMPTIONS TO THOSE LIMITS ARE GRANTED TO THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT BERRIES PROCESS WHICH IS STREAMLINING CAN BE PURSUED TO THE COMPLETION. THE MIDDLE OF FORMS ALONE. DISTRICTS ARE FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IT WAS STILL TAKE THE GRANTING OF RELIEF AND RELATED FEES ARE OFTEN WAY. IN OUR LOCAL PROJECTS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT POWER IS PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT MINIMIZES THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF EMISSIONS. FROM THE OPERATION OF DIESEL BACKUP GENERATORS. AND IMPORTANT BECAUSE JUST WITHIN THE SOUTH COAST THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SUCH GENERATORS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL WITH SOME OF THOSE BEING OVER FORTY YEARS OLD. ALL OF THESE POTENTIAL TREATMENT. OUT FOUR OKAY OF NITROGEN WHAT WE CALLED DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER A POTENT CARCINOGEN THE MANY OF THESE BACK UP GENERATORS ARE NEW RESIDENTS IN SCHOOL. FOR EXAMPLE FOR A PEER TO PEER YES YES EVENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN LA IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WE CALCULATE THE NEARLY SIX TONS OF KNOX MISSIONS PER DAY WERE ADMITTED MADE WE NEEDED. BY THE GENERATED IN THE S. P. S. AFFECTED AREA. DOES EMISSIONS ARE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE DAILY MISSION OF THE LARGEST FINALLY. IN THE SOUTH COAST. SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS. PER OF CURRENT RECORD ANSWER. WE NOW BUT THEN WE TRIED TO REACH A LOCAL NON LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. HE OFFERED LOCAL RULE CHANGES TO PROVIDE A REGULATORY PATDRESS THE SPONSORS EXPRESSED CONCERN. EVER THERE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND WE STILL POSIBILIDAD POSE COULD BE AMENDED.

OKAY ANY FINAL VOLKSWAGEN CALL FOR FOLKS ONE RAISE CONCERNS. OKAY AND OUT OF SB TEN NINETY NINE STARS TURN. TO DO IS A MATTER MODERATE JUST CONFIRMING WE DON'T WE DON'T WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY NEW PEOPLE. CURRENT ONLY. OKAY OKAY ALL RIGHT. SO THE MATTER IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I MEAN LOOK I YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYONE HEARD THE TESTIMONY BOTH SIDES THIS IS A SITUATION. YOU KNOW I THINK. THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHORS AND CLEARLY WE'VE GOTTEN A SITUATION WHERE. YOU KNOW THE TOP LEAST WE MEET AT THAT THE FOLKS WHO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO POINT TO ANY EXAMPLE OF TIMES WHEN- WHEN THEIR BOARDS HAVE A FIND. AGENCIES OR HOSPITALS OR- WATER- WATER DEPARTMENTS WATER AGENCIES- FOR. POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF GENERATORS THAT WERE USED DURING THE S. P. S. ADVANTAGE. BE SORRY DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN- I'M INTERESTED IN THE KIND OF CONSTRAINTS THAT EVERYONE'S UNDER WHEN THERE IS A P. S. P. S. OF AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND. THE YOU KNOW. THE ACT IS IN THE- REYES AND I'M ALL THE FOOTWORK WITHIN THESE ORGANS FOR IN CERTAINTY I THINK THE GUY NO PLACE. FIVE AND YOU HEARD THAT. YOU KNOW YOUR PEOPLE JUST RAISE EM AT THE GUN ON THE ON THE BILL SIDE YOU KNOW BOB THEY WANT TO AS EXPENSIVE AS BILLS POSSIBLE ON THE AIR DISTRICTS AYE THE BIG I THINK JUST OBJECT TO THE GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL. BUT WE TEND TO A PLACE WHERE I THINK WE'VE- THE- PROVIDES BOTH SIDES WITH WITH WHAT THEY NEED NOW THAT BEING SAID I UNDERSTAND SOCIAL CONCERNS OUT THERE ABOUT HOSPITALS LASSEN WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE. SPITTLE YEAH BE FEAR FOR. OF FIVE STAYING BECAUSE OF- OF CONCERNS OF. COMPLIANCE THAT BEING SAID WE ALSO DON'T WANT ANYONE TO USE THESE. HIGHLY POLLUTING GENERATORS ANYMORE THEY ACTUALLY NEED TO BE. AND SO THAT'S AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK A BALANCE HERE. AND I JUST. MY KIND OF. IT IS THE THIRD OF YOU HAVE WITH SAID IT WOULD HAVE IN IRAQ LITTLE TO SIGN BAR WHEN I MADE MY CALL ABOUT THE EARLIER AND GET YOU CERTAINLY. THE WILD CARDS ARE MUCH SEVERE. BEFORE AND THEY CITY OF THIS IS THE FALL OF CLIMATE N<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;CA ABOUT IT. I&lt;/c&gt;</u> SAY. THAT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT TOWN THAT THE UTILITY DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY. TO HAVE MUCH MORE FORGET IT YES YES. MUCH MORE G. OTHER. PS EVENTS OF THE FAR FEWER PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR POWER CUT OFF AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE INSTANCES WHERE WE TO CUT PEOPLE'S POWER NO PROVIDE CERTAINTY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOW WE ALSO- YOU KNOW ME. THIS IS THIS IS A VERY TANGIBLE EXAMPLE. HOW THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. OF P. JEANNIE COMPARE TO THEIR SISTER BROTHER I DOWN TO THE GULF. REAL NOT ONLY HARMING CONSUMERS BUT ALSO HARMING OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY THE MAIN ALTERNATIVE OUT THERE AND I THINK THE PERSON FROM THE SIERRA CLUB SAID THIS PAST THE MIDDLE. OUT THERE AND THE PRINCE. THE ARTIST BECAUSE GENERATORS ARE HIGHLY POLLUTING- THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THIS IS NOT GOOD ALTERNATIVE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT WHERE I MOVED TOWARD ELECTRIFICATION. AND YET WE WILL NEED A WE NEED. OUT WE NEED TO HELP DEVELOP BETTER WAYS OF ADDRESSING THE- HE HAD USE OF POWER DURING. I THESE WILDFIRES A WORK THAT ARE ENFORCING TO CONTINUE TO BE A NEW NORMAL AS CLIMATE CHANGE GETS WORSE AS OUR DROUGHTS CONTINUE TO. DEEPEN SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE WE'VE COME CLOSE TO FINDING AN ELEGANT COMPROMISE HERE I KNOW THIS CONVERSATION'S GOING TO CONTINUE THEIR STILL THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS OBVIOUS YOU OFFER. THEM ALL ON THE CALL I DO WANT TO THANK MY STAFF FOR ERIKA AND THEN GABRIELLE AND OTHERS FROM OUR TEAM HAVE REALLY BEEN WORKING HARD CREDIT. THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE. I'M NO ONE'S ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH FOR THESE BILLS ARE YET BUT I THINK GET PLACE WHERE YOU CAN. AND WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME REALLY GREAT PEOPLE SOLUTIONS. THAT THE CURRENT CORE PRINCIPLES THAT I'VE I'VE TRIED TO ARTICULATE- SO THAT'S ACTUALLY STEP PHILOSOPHY WITH WHICH WE'VE BEEN APPROACHING THIS. IS A IT AS I AM THAT'S. BECAUSE OF PUTS ON THIS TIME. THANK YOU. ON THIS TOPIC A ABOUT IT I ABSOLUTE AGREE OUR FRIENDS ZERO CLUB SAYS THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO MOVE TO CALL WAY. OF GENERATING INDEPENDENT POWER DURING THESE-KINDS OF INSISTED IN INCIDENCES SO- WITHOUT A LOVE TO HEAR THE THOUGHTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SAYS AND WHAT CASKEY. I'M ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS I SEE IN BOULDER IS FOR SUGGESTED- TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO THE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE FIVE. MINUTES YOU KNOW THE RICH TO THE RETIREMENT OF THESE POLLUTING GENERATORS. WHAT TYPE OF SHAPE IS THAT WOMAN. LANGUAGE AND- ARE YOU ARE YOU ACCEPTING IN CONCEPT IT'S THE STAFF WELL. YES IT BE YOU HEARD THERE WAS STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE OKAY WOULD WOULD OKAY WITH THESE THESE AMENDMENTS AND WE TOLD CHAIR YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE OKAY OKAY WITH THE CHAIR YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HEARING SOME OF THE BIG BASS HOSPITALS AND BARELY REPUBLIC. SERVICES THAT FEEL LIKE. HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE NOW. THESE BUSINESSES ARE BEING REQUIRED TO GET INTO A NEW AGREEMENT- WITH REGARD TO A P. S. P. S. THAT. YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY DIABETES WHAT IT WHAT IT THE I THINK THEY BELIEVE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE A MORE HOLISTIC OVER. BUT IT IS USING A GENERATOR IF THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH DIESEL POLLUTANTS WHICH WE DO AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR IN HIS COMMENTS. THOSE THOSE REGULATION SHOULD BE COMING NOT NECESSARILY AS A RESULT OF THE P. S. P. S. TYPE OF SITUATION BETTER AS A RESULT FOR IT NEED. HERE DISTRICT AND I STE HE ALSO YES WORD WERE TAKING THESE AMENDMENTS TODAY. BUT WE'VE TALKED TO THE CHAIR ABOUT HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS IS THIS THING YOU KNOW MOVES ON TO THE PERHAPS THE OTHER SIDE AND- WE WILL- YEAH WORK WITH THE CHAIR ALL. STEP OF THE WAY BECAUSE I MEAN WE IT IT GETS INTO WERE USED THE TERM ESSENTIAL FACILITIES AND NOW WE HAVE CRITICAL FACILITIES IN. I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON WHO. WHO WHO. I BUSINESSES BEING AFFECTED YOU KNOW A- BILL I KNOW MY TOWN OUR WATERS TREATMENTS DISTRICT IS GOT THEY'VE GOT THE TREATMENT FACILITY THIS THERE AND THEN THEY GOT A MINISTRY TO FILL. BUILDING ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING THESE RUN A GENERATOR IF THERE'S A PS PS RESIST THE POINT THAT. RIGHT SO. BECAUSE YOUR CALL WHO ON THEIR INTO THAT HE TO HAVE NAY ON THEIR- DEFINITION FOR HEALTH SIX THEIR YOUR YOUR- STEPHEN IF SUPPORTERS INCLUDING GASOLINE STATIONS AND GROCERY STORES SWITCHER IF YOU'RE OUT OF GAS THAT'S CRITICAL FACILITY I DOUBT BUT- FOR THIS LIMITED TIME DURING THE PSP AT. DO WE WANT TO STAY WILL NOT THESE THINGS SHUT DOWN AND YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR FACILITY TO SELL CIGARETTES WHERE IN MINUTES THERE'S- GOING TO BE VERY NARROW I THINK. ON WHO IS A NUMBER FOR. YES AND WHO ARE THE REST OF US MY FATHER IN LAW INCLUDING WHO'S GOT ONE THESE GENERATORS OR TURN IT ON I MEAN IF WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE TRYING A MONTH SO. I'M TO DO. SOMETHING WORKED OUT BETWEEN OFFICE. THE LOCAL THEIR DISTRICT YOU KNOW SOMETHING ITS- SCHEDULE. IF WE HAVE A TO BROADEN THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A CRITICAL FACILITY THAT COULD OPEN IT UP SO. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE DIRTY. GENERATORS THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA QUIT SHORT MY DAY ONLY TURN IT UP. THEIR THEIR POLLUTANTS ARE EMISSIONS ARE GOING TO BE. COUNTED AGAIN BY THE LOCAL TEST SO I'M HOPING FOR. I DID GO AHEAD WELL I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WE HAVE REGULATIONS IN PLACE THAT RETIRE THOSE. AT SOME SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S WHAT THE AGREEMENT IS BENT. BUT FOR YES THAT'S WHY I SHOULD. I SHOULD ALL THE SAID SPEAK. ANOTHER LEVEL OF BUREAUCRACY THAT. PUTS FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON- YET COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO STAY IN BUSINESS I WOULD SUGGEST COVERT NINETEEN IN. SUCH AN IN PEOPLE BEING OUT OF BUSINESS A LONG AS THEY ARE. I DON'T THINK OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BUSINESSES THE TO HAPPY WITH US. IT THE PSP TO NOT. THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW DOWN THE BUSINESSES FOR. TWO OR THREE TWO THREE DAYS SO IT'S THESE ARE TOUGH SITUATIONS I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO LOOKING AT. NARROWING IT DOWN THERE IN THAT I MEAN ORIGINALLY THE I THINK THE OTHER THING IS TO THE NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO. SPUR GLAZER. IT IS IN A TEN BY TO BE COOPERATIVE WITH THE SENATE AND MERGE BILL SO WE HAVE FAR FEWER BILL STAFF TO HERE. IN FRONT OF OUR COMMITTEES AND OBVIOUSLY IN FRONT OF THE FULL SENATE WE'VE MERGED BILLS AND SO THE INTENT OF MY BILL FOR EXAMPLE. IS THE ALBUM MORE NARROW AT THE- AND NOW. SENATOR GLAZERS BILL I THINK HE IS IN TUNE WITH THAT MIRRORING THAT MORE JUST TO CRITICAL HEALTH. FACILITIES SO LET'S LET'S HAVE SENATOR. GLAZER MISTER CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU ARE POINTING OUT AND I'M SURE IT'S AN ENGLISH AS A STRONG OPINION I KNOW HE DOES. FOR PUTTING TENSION EXISTS IN THIS RIGHT. HERE THERE. IS ALL THE STUFF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REQUIRES A KIND THE NEW ONES OF A LOCAL CONVERSATION HOW YOU KNOW. DOES THE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND THE SUIT XIN AT THE- FACILITY. I THINK GLAZER. FOR MORE WHY THIRTY TO. LEAVE THIS UP TO. KIND OF YOU AND YOU DISTURBED. TITIAN BUT THERE'S- I DO THAT LATER BUT I'M SURE YOU I'M SURE YOU. ARTICULATE PUSHED BACK. ALL RIGHT Q. IS THIRD FIVE AIR DOES. THIRTY FIVE THEIR DISTRICTS. AND YET THERE'S NO SAND. FIND PASSABLE WILL THAT WILL TAKE A LA EIGHT THAT CA. WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAR UP AND BEGIN. AND THIS ORDER THE ALL. BUT ARE OUR- CLICK WITH WE'RE GOING TO NOW SIX KATIS. BUT YOU FOR A HOSPITALS. ALL THAT'S GOING. ON WITH THE PAN. AND WE CREATE YOUR- BE. SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ARE YOU WITH. I APPRECIATE THAT THE COULD ABOUT. PLACE TO IT IN THIS OVER TRYING TO THE HOT. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON TO KEEP THE POWER TO KEEP A LOT. THAT'S WHAT I TRYING TO DO IN THIS PART OF THE BILL. AND THEIR DISTRICTS TO CREATE BUREAUCRACY TO GET IN THE WAY THAT THEY'RE NOT ARGUE. THE A SERIOUS. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION OF THE SHARES ENGAGEMENT. CERTAINLY OF SENATOR DODD'S LEADERSHIP. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M HOPING THAT LET'S THROUGH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. THE I TRY TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT YES THERE IS THAT AND- THAT WE'RE TAKING THE- SUCH AS BACKWARD. POSSIBLES IN THAT NARROW SPACE. PS PS IS ARE ARE NOT. HAVING BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES HERE THEY ARE BRAND NEW. AND THEY'RE VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE WANT TO ELIMINATE THEM. AS THE PROBLEM OF THE HOSPITALS. THAT HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN THIS SITUATION SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO NARAL. PROVIDE THAT. NOW WHAT I HOPE WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD. DID YOU. I HEARD YOU GRIMLY ON YOUR BREATH I AND IT IT IT IT'S YOU WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL MULLICAN FOR EVERY HOSPITALS THAT MAY HAVE THREE YEAR OLD GENERATOR TO TURN IT OFF. AND THAT AND I SEE THAT PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES BUT- OTHER PART OF IT IS IT'S SAYING YOU KNOW. YOU CAN YOU'VE GOT TO IT MAY HAVE TO CALL MONEY AND I CAN I GET THAT WITH THE COVERT NINE. YOU GOT A READ IT THE GENERATORS ARE YOU WANT TO GET THERE THE CENTER MORE BLACK TO GET A LET'S THE. GUEST WHAT DO YOU SOMEBODY YOU AMEND TACTIC ON. ON THE INVITE RIGHT TESTIMONY IS THE THESE ARE THIS IS A THESE REALLY BAD POLLUTANTS THAT TO THE BIG CHILDREN IN THE AFFECTED POLLUTE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE SO IT'S A IT'S A LOT OF BAD.

DEAL WITH IT AFTER. WE'VE GOT TO. PLACE IN THAT'S WHERE WE KEEP GOING TO HOLD IT UNDER THE CHALLENGE. THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA SHOULD ANYBODY DOWN BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT AFTERWARDS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS A REAL EMERGENCY AND THEN IT WAS BONTA THING AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. YEAH WE HAVE ESSENTIAL. ALREADY WITH OUR OWN. REGULATIONS WOULD ASK. CHIEF BEING PULLED AWAY IN A DEFINITE THAT THAT THAT'S ALL ALREADY DEFINED. I DID IT BARBARA YOU ON THE LINE. YEAH NHI&lt;c.cyan&gt; LET&lt;/c&gt; LET'S SO WHAT I THINK I LOOK I THINK I MEAN THIS LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS BILL THIS IT THESE TWO BILLS THAT WERE SORT OF EXCRUCIATINGLY CLOSE I THINK WE'RE KIND OF SEEING THINGS THAT ARE NOT DISCORDANT BUT YOU KNOW GETTING PLACER WE SHOULD BOTH FULLY PROMOTE STATE IN A WEIRD WAY.

AND I THOUGHT GOODNESS WHAT IT YOU KNOW JUST A SIMPLE IDEA OF HAVING OUR START LOOKING IT UP. THERE'S NO SIX B. TO MEET SOMEONE JUST TAKE THIS OP. AYE AYE AYE SIR LOOKING IT UP ONLINE HOW DO WE GET A GENERATOR AND ENSURE THAT THERE'S NATURAL GENERATORS AND- BY THE COMPANY BY WESCOTT EVEN LOOK UP THEIR STOCK PRICE IN HOUSE GENERATORS MUST REALLY BE. BRING A LOT BUT- NEWS FOR THE TAMPA BECAUSE OF WHAT'S CALIFORNIA SURE NAPA JUST A LOT OF ACTIVISTS ARE STARTED WORKING ON IT FOR MY FOR MY HOME IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG DEAL YOU GOT IT IS NOT. YOU KNOW IN AN EMERGENCY. THIS WOULD BE GREAT. I THOUGHT WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR STATE WITH THAT PS PS AND HOW WOULD THIS BE HELPFUL IN SO THAT- MISTER CHAIR WAS THE SORT OF THAT. THE ENDING OF A- THE BILL THAT WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN THESE GENERATORS SELL WELL BUT WE ALSO NEED HIM FOR BUSINESSES I. READING THE PAPER THAT I LAST FALL IT SHOWS WAS TRYING TO GIVE AWAY ALL THEIR FROZEN FOOD BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T KEEP THE- FREEZER'S GOING UP. YES CAN OF. BURKE ALL THESE BUSINESS UP IN THE STATE THAT ARE IN LOUISE OWNS- I'M USED TO HAVING BACKUP GENERATORS AT THE COUNTY- BIG DIESEL ENGINES READY TO GO- BUT I WOULDN'T. THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO SAY IT'S- IN A- WHAT'S THERE BUT IF YOU'RE BORED REMODELING OR WORKING ON SOMETHING NEW THEN YOU SHOULD BE AT LEAST LOOKING AT THAT BUT THAT. THE NATURAL GAS WHICH I THINK IS AN OBVIOUS FORMER FUELING BACKUP GENERATION NATURAL GAS IS CLEANER THAN DIESEL FUEL YOU'VE DEBATED THAT. IN MOST CASES IT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH FIFTY NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE YOU JUST HOOK RIGHT UP TO. UTILITY THE VOICE TO. TRUCK OR TRANSPORT LARGE AMOUNTS OF DIESEL FUEL- IT WHICH WOULD BE EXTREMELY AWKWARD DURING THE FIRE SITUATION OR CONDITION- LET ALONE HAVING TO STORED AT ALL TIMES. THIS IS OUR ISSUED THERE IS CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE TECHNOLOGY UTILIZED FOR BACKUP GENERATION. IN DOING SO WE HOPE THAT EMERGENCY VARIANCES ARE GRANTED RAPIDLY AND WITH EASE TO OPERATORS OF NAT GAS BACKUP GENERATORS. SPLA THE WHEN EIGHTY FIVE WITH A PRETTY GOOD FACILITIES BAKER YOU'D- DIESEL GENERATOR FROM CAN TO A- THE KEY STANDARD IMAGE BILL IS A VERY. POWERS AND APPLYING FOR HIM THE FIRE. IT IS NOT MANDATE IN THIS BILL THAT IT OPERATOR SWITCH TO. GAS OR A FORMS OF GENERATE. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO EASE THE ISSUANCE OF EMERGENCY VARIANCES PARTICULARLY FORD TRUCK HAS NOT BURDEN THE ISSUANCE OF PERMITS THE- MISSING THESE. THE LATEST VERSION THE BILL FAR FROM. AFTER WORK IT WAS IT YOUR COMMUTE. INTO A AGREEMENT THAT EMERGE BURKE ARE THE BEST AVENUE FOR SO TO GO THROUGH AND TO. OPERATE BRING PS P.
