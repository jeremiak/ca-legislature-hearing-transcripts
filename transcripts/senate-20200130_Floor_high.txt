FRED KOREMATSU IS AN AMERICAN ICON HIS PERSISTENCE IN THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE HAS INSPIRED GENERATIONS. FRED KOREMATSU WAS ARRESTED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO WHEN HE VIOLATED EXECUTIVE ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX. THE REMOVAL ORDER FOR AMERICANS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY DURING WORLD WAR TWO. AND A. C. L. A. U. ATTORNEY DEFENDED HIS CASE PLEASE CONVICTED IT'S A SUBSEQUENTLY INCARCERATED AT THE TOPAZ CONCENTRATION CAMP AND UTAH. THIS CASE WAS REPEALED WAS APPEALED AND HURT BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR BUT THE CONVICTION WAS UNFORTUNATELY UP HELD. HOWEVER FORTY YEARS AFTER HIS ARREST HE RE OPENED HIS CASE WITH THE PRO BONO LEGAL TEAM AND FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF AIR. CORPS ON NOTICE HIS LAWYERS ARGUED THAT THERE WAS NEW EVIDENCE THAT SHOWED SUPPRESSION ALTERATION AND DESTRUCTION BY US GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OF EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE NEITHER DISLOYAL NOT PREDISPOSED TO ESPIONAGE. THAT NO FAX SUPPORTED THE DECISION TO INCARCERATE JAPANESE AMERICANS IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. THIS PETITION WAS GRANTED AND HIS CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED. THIS DECISION HAS HAD READ. ON OTHER CASES INFLUENCE THE BACK EDGE OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT THE INCARCERATION OF JAPANESE AMERICANS WAS UNJUST. AND OCCURRED DUE TO RACIAL PREJUDICE WARTIME HYSTERIA THE FAILURE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. IS DIRECTED TO SPEAK UP WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT RESONATES EVEN MORE TODAY. WE MUST REMEMBER HIS LEGACY AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO MAINTAIN AND AFFIRM OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES GUARANTEED UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THE EIGHT LET'S CAUCUS AND JOINING AND I ON AS SIXTY NINE THREE. FRED CORN. DAY OF CIVIL AND THE CONSTITUTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEARCH FOR. MISTER PRESIDENT SPEAK UP WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT. SPEAK UP WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT. SPEAK UP WHEN THE POPULATION SAYS GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND YOU KNOW IT'S WRONG THAT IS THE HARDEST THING FOR ALL OF US TO DO. WE GET ELECTED AND SOMETIMES THE STEREO OF THE MOMENT. GREAT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE WRONG I DON'T REMEMBER WHO THE NAME OF THE SENATOR IN THIS BODY WAS BUT THERE WAS ONE SENATOR WHO SPOKE UP BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG. ON THIS BODY IN THIS HOUSE ON A RESOLUTION DEALING WITH THE JAPANESE INTERNMENT. IT IS THE HARDEST THING. AND SO BEYOND THE LARGER MESSAGE OF FRED KOREMATSU AND WE'VE SOLDERED HIS DAUGHTER HERE IN OTHERS OVER THE YEARS. IT IS THE HARDEST THING FOR ALL OF US PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR FRIENDS. AMONG OUR CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED US AND I JUST THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT. TO IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE AS WE FACE TODAY ALL SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO SPEAK UP WHERE THEY KNOW THINGS ARE WRONG IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VALUE THAT WE CAN ENGAGE IN. AND I STAND PROUDLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION FOR THAT PURPOSE. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS A- THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I THANK SENATOR PAN UP FOR RECOGNIZING OF FRED KOREMATSU FOR TODAY.

FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED HE REFUSED TO GO TO INTERMINGLE HE WAS ARRESTED AND CONVICTED HE APPEALED HIS CASE ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN XENOPHOBIA WAS CONSIDERED PATRIOTISM. FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SUPREME COURT REPUDIATED THE KOREMATSU RULING. NOW COLLEAGUES IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST XENOPHOBIA AND HONOR HEROES LIKE FRED KOREMATSU FAMILY INCARCERATION IS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THIS COUNTRY. MORE PEOPLE NEED THE COURAGE OF FRED KOREMATSU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SCENE NINE SOONER PAN WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU I THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THEIR VERY IMPORTANT REMARKS I WOULD ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THOSE.

MEMBERS COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I RISE TO PRESENT SR SEVENTY THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES JANUARY IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA TOPS MANY LISTS THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SETTING PRECEDENTS FOR LAWS THAT VALUE PEOPLE INCLUSION. AND HOME TO SOME OF THE NATION'S BEST UNIVERSITIES AND MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES BUT SADLY CALIFORNIA IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST IN TERMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OUR STATE HAS AMONGST THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF LABOR AND SEX TRAFFICKING WE HAVE BECOME A HOT SPOT FOR PREDATORS BECAUSE OF OUR MAJOR HARBOURS HIGHWAYS AIRPORTS ECONOMY AND PROXIMITY TO THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER. MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND INSTANCES OF TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN REPORTED. TO THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TWELVE TO HEAR. BUT IT'S EVEN TOUGHER ONE TO HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TACKLING THE ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR YEARS PASSING LAWS TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS. CRACKDOWN ON PREDATORS AND HELP IN THIS FORM OF SLAVERY. WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM SURVIVOR'S ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE INTO WORD AND THAT IS PLAYED A POWERFUL PARTING GUIDING OUR EFFORTS. WE MUST AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON WAYS TO STOP SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKERS FROM EXPLOITING PEOPLE AND PUT AN END TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO WE CAN HELP THOSE IMPACTED COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS. FOR THESE REASONS AND IN SUPPORT OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS WHO NEED OUR HELP I URGE YOU TO VOTE I'D ON SR SEVENTY. HI SENATOR RUBIO.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE RESOLUTION SEVENTY AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORT RESOLUTION FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING PLAGUES. CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY AFFECTS MY REGION IN SAN DIEGO. IN FACT THE FBI HAS LISTED SAN DIEGO IS ONE OF THE THIRTEEN WORST REGIONS. FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE EQUALLY RATED. THIS IS A DISGRACE TO OUR STATE AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE RESOLUTION AND MANY PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A FAR OFF PROBLEM. REALLY ISN'T IT'S NOT IT'S RIGHT HERE AT HOME IT'S IN SACRAMENTO IT'S IN LA IT'S IN SAN DIEGO. IT'S IN THE BAY AREA. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS COMBAT THE SEVEN. THAT AFFECTS SOME OF OUR STATES MY OF OUR POPULAR IN. THE JUST GLASS NIGHT I. A INTERESTING KERR. AND I WISH I COULD REMEMBER TOO BUT IT WAS A COMMERCIAL ENCOURAGING THE HOME SERVICES INDUSTRY PLUMBERS ELECTRICIANS- LANDSCAPERS PEOPLE WORK IN PEOPLE'S HOMES- TO KEEP AN EYE OUT. FOR EVIDENCE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS AND ACTUALLY GAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD POINTERS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY IT AND REACTS TO IT SO AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU THE AUTHOR- CENTER RESOLUTION SEVENTY- IS OF. A VERY GOOD FIRST STEP THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT CENTERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF- THE SUPPORT RESOLUTION ONE THANK OUR PRO TEM FOR- BRING THIS FORD.

SEX TRAFFICKING SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU- THE PRO TEM FOR LEADERSHIP BUT ALSO- APPRECIATE THAT THIS CHAMBER HAS ALSO BEEN TAKING ACTION TO TRY TO COMBAT AND REDUCE- THIS HORRIBLE WITH. FLEXION IN OUR SOCIETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DURAZO. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND ALSO AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE RESOLUTION AND VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BRING AWARENESS TO THE IMPACT THE HARMFUL IMPACT THAT THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION POLICIES ARE AND HOW THEY AFFECT- THESE THESE VICTIMS THESE POLICIES RIGHT NOW CREATE BARRIERS. TAKE THE WHO STRUCK A COME FORWARD TO REPORT THE EVIL THAT THEY IN. TO BE ABLE TO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACCESS THE PROTECTION SUPPORT THEY NEED. THIS MEANS THESE SURVIVORS ARE PUSHED BACK INTO THE SHADOWS RE TRAFFIC AND NEW VICTIMS ARE CREATED BY PERPETRATORS WERE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE MUST SUPPORT THESE BRAVE SURVIVORS TO COME FORWARD AND PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUE THANK APPROACH HIM ON THE WOMEN'S ISSUE I SERVE ON THE STATE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS- AS AN APPOINTEE OF THE PRO TEM BUT- THIS IS MY THIRD GO ROUND THE COMMISSION I THINK WHEN I FIRST SERVED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO. I PARTICIPATED IN THE HEARING AT UCLA A FORMER STATE SENATOR SHEILA KILL WAS ON THE COMMISSION AT THAT TIME AND THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED WE HEARD- AMAZING STATISTICS ABOUT. THE INCIDENCE OF CHAT SEX TRAFFICKING PARTICULARLY AROUND PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC EVENTS. AND MAJOR ATHLETIC EVENTS LIKE THE SUPER BOWL. AND SO THIS WEEKEND IN MIAMI I AM SURE THE INCIDENCE OF SEX TRAFFICKING WILL INCREASE TENFOLD. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE YOU KNOW DEMAND DICTATE SUPPLY AND SO I'M HOPING AS WE ALL ARE ENJOYING- THE GAME THIS SUNDAY AND LOOKING AT ALL THE COMMERCIALS THAT BECAUSE OF THE- ELECTED TO WORK A REFUND. AS. HI BROWN FEWER WOMEN AND BOYS ARE VICTOR OF FOR AS A RESULT OF MAJOR ATHLETIC EVENTS- I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SR SEVENTY. THANK YOU SENATOR SCANNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION AND I WANT TO THANK OUR PRO TEM NOT ONLY FOR INTRODUCTION BUT ALSO FOR HER REFERENCE TO THAT ARE THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT WE ARE SEEING AN IS BOTH. IT'S LABOR AND SEX THERE'S ED I THINK FOR MANY IT WAS VIEWED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE LENS OF THIS IS SEX TRAFFICKING BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THAT IN MANY CASES IT'S BOTH THE VICTIMS ARE BEING USED FOR BOTH AND IN OTHER CASES IT'S JUST ONE OR THE OTHER AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO RATE IS THAT IT'S MORE CONGESTED NATIONAL SOON OTHERWISE IT'S MORE THAN JUST PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES BUT DOMESTIC SO. CAN ALL RELATE A COUPLE OF THINGS IN MY OWN DISTRICT- OVER A DECADE AGO THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE A BERKELEY HIGH STUDENTS NOTICED THERE'S A MOTEL RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS TO WRITE FOR THE BERKELEY HIGH PAPER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE THESE GIRLS THAT EVERY DAY WORKS WEEPING IN FRONT OF THIS MOTEL AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL AND THEY NOTICED EVERY DAY SEEING THOSE GIRLS KNOWING THAT THEY WERE SCHOOL AGE AND WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO A STAY DURING MY BEST GAVE REPORTING AND BEGAN TO INTERACT WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN AND THEY FOUND THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE BROUGHT OVER BY THE OWNER OF-THE MOTEL WHO ALSO LOTS OF THEIR PROPERTY AND THEY WERE SICKLY THE GENERAL NO SIR THIS FOR THIS PROPERTY BUT PAID. THEY WERE ALL SO BEING. AT OLD FOR SEX. EIGHT NINE AS A RESULT OF THE BERKELEY HIGH ARTICLE THE WAS A- AND A RING WAS BASIC STOCK. MEANWHILE IN MY DID WE HAD SITUATIONS WERE OUTSIDE OF GROUP HOMES AND OUTSIDE OF LOCATIONS WHERE GOOD SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OUR FOSTER YOUTH WE HAD PREDATORS BASICALLY- RIGHT AROUND OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS. TO RECRUIT THESE FOSTER THE MOSTLY YOUNG WOMEN BUT BOYS ALSO INTO THEIR SEX TRADE AND OF COURSE THESE FOSTER KIDS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY VULNERABLE WITH THE LITLE A WITH FEW ADULTS THAT THEY CAN RELY ON- DEPEND ON AND OF COURSE THE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS ARE VERY GOOD AT GETTING VULNERABLE PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT SOMEHOW THEY CAN TRUST THEM AND RELY ON THEM. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC FOR LABOR PURPOSES AND SEX TRAFFICKING PURPOSES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. YES I WANT TO THANK ARE GOOD LEADER FROM SAN DIEGO- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE OTHER SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO THIS ISN'T JUST CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM. THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM AND IT'S ALL ABOUT DE HUMANIZING PRIMARILY GIRLS AND WOMEN. IT IS ALSO ABOUT DE HUMANIZING OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHICH IS THE REASON GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST ANYWAY TO PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE AND WHILE IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS IF YOU'RE AT THE AIRPORT THERE AND DISHES THAT SAY IF YOU SUSPECT HUMAN TRAFFICKING HERE'S A NUMBER TO CALL. WE REQUIRED AT HOTELS I WOULD SUBMIT THAT MOST OTHER STATES PROBABLY DON'T EVEN DO THIS. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS GANGS RESPONSIBLE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING HAVE FOUND IT SAFER AND MORE PROFITABLE TO NOW ENGAGE IN SEX TRAFFICKING. THERE IN LIES THE RUB AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM TO RECOGNIZE WHEN WE DEHUMANIZE HUMAN BEINGS WE THEN CANNONS THEM WHETHER IT'S IN SEX TRAFFICKING WHETHER IT'S IN THE USE OF FREE LABOR. WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A HUMAN COMMUNITY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN BEING. AND ONLY AT THE SUPER BOWL ARE WE GOING TO SEE IN INCREASE IN THIS KIND OF TRAFFIC. IT IS ALSO WHAT THEY WEAR THAN FOR ALL VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS AT ITS PEAK. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WAR. IN OUR SYSTEM. POLL AND SO ARE YOU APPRECIATE THE GOOD FROM SANDY BRINGING THIS PUTS FOLK ON WHAT THE IS CHANGE THIS CULTURE AND DO MORE TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE AND DO MORE TO PROTECT YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN WHO ARE PRIMARILY THE VICTIMS OF THE SEX TRAFFICKING WITH THAT I WOULD GINGIVAL.
