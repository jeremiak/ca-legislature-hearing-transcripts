00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.666
TO CONSIDER. I'M SO WE FOCUSED

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:18.370
ON. THE RESEARCH. CALIFORNIA

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.472
AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO. MORE

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.408
AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS. SO

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:23.008
IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID I

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:24.676
MEAN THERE'S POSSIBILITY

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.578
THERE'S LOTS OF SOLUTIONS THAT

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.547
HAVE BEEN PUT OUT BUT WHY ARE

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:30.482
THEY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WHY

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:31.016
ARE NICE FOR STUDENTS NOT

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.551
GETTING ACCESS TO IT. SO ONE OF

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:36.422
THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT WAS-

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:36.989
THE FINANCIAL AID ACCESS FOR

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:40.659
STUDENTS. AND HOW IS THAT HOW

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.628
IS THAT EMPLOYMENT AND HOW MANY

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:43.228
OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:44.663
GETTING TO IT. I'M THERE. AND

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.698
REPORT- IT WAS A LITTLE

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.834
DAUNTING HOW WE ACTUALLY JUST

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.369
PRESENTED THE RIVERSIDE

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.671
CONFERENCE. I WAS PROUD BUY

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.007
TICKETS CALLED GREEN LIGHT RED

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:58.477
TAPE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID AND

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.111
WHAT HE DID WAS HE TALKED ABOUT

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:02.614
BARRIER. BETTER BUSINESS FROM

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:03.148
GETTING THE FINANCIAL AID

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.883
THAT'S ON THE TABLE. WHAT ARE

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.318
FINANCIALLY TASK FORCE IT IN

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.353
THIS WAS ACTUALLY INITIATED BY

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.489
FRENCH LATEX. OFFICERS ACROSS

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.458
THE STATE. WAS IDENTIFIED OVER

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.526
A HUNDRED BEST PRACTICES THAT

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.127
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:16.695
OPERATION WITHOUT ANY

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.530
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THAT WITH

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:24.369
JAZZ NOT DOWN THESE BARRIERS.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:24.937
SO ONE OF THE FINANCIAL AID

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.472
OFFICERS CAME UP WITH THE

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.039
TAGLINE I DON'T KNOW IF ITS

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:30.409
ORIGINAL BUT I LIKED IT IT WAS.

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:34.480
DOUBT COULD GIVE IT. BUT YOU

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.013
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.448
RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL AID

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.684
OFFICERS HAVE SO MUCH THEY FEEL

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.752
BURDEN OF LIABILITY AND

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.421
PROTECTING THE COLLEGES

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.590
LIABILITY FROM NOT. DOTTING ALL

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.692
THE I'S AND CROSSING OF THE

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:50.662
TEASE AND SO YOU CAN ASK THEN

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:52.764
LOTS OF QUESTIONS BUT WHEN

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.566
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.604
STUDENTS WHO HAVE OUR FIRST AND

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.474
STUDENTS TO COLLEGE NOT HAD-

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:03.108
THIS DISTANCE AND SUPPORT THEY

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.612
NEED IF NOT ALL THIS PAPERWORK

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.947
WE ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:12.684
OUR SYSTEM. I FELT PRESS PHOTO

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:16.588
SELECT RIGHT. THE MONEY GETS

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.189
LEFT TABLE THAT REALLY SHOULD

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.423
BE IN THE HANDS FOR STUDENTS

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:18.991
I'M REALLY PROUD THAT WE PUT

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.325
OUT A FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:20.926
REALLY REALLY SPEARHEADED BY

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.861
FINANCIAL AID THERE REALLY

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:26.431
CHANGES THE CULTURE. OF THE- OF

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:30.536
HOW WE OPERATE ON OUR CARS

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:31.169
COLLEGES AND IT REALLY SHOULD

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.439
BE STUDENT CENTERED BUT SHOULD

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.408
OPERATE LIKE A CUSTOMER SERVICE

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:36.975
CENTER. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:42.381
HOW WE PUT. THIS YEAR SERVICE

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:42.881
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRIVATE

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:43.482
COLLEGES THAT'S WHAT THEY DO

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.616
ONE OF THE FOUR LAKES OF GOING

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.685
AFTER STUDENTS IS YOU KNOW HOW

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.554
TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.389
AFFORD EDUCATION. IN

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.491
CALIBRATING BECAUSE WE TAKE IT

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.560
FOR GRANTED THAT CAN THAT. CAN

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.862
IS LOW. WE DON'T WE DON'T MAKE

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.764
THAT ONE OF OUR OUR- OUR MAJOR

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.832
POINTS AND SO I THINK THAT WE

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.701
DO NEED TO CHANGE OUR FOCUS ON

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:06.405
THAT- I GET THE SIX LEGISLATORS

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.507
DONE A GREAT JOB IN HELPING US

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:12.578
TO GET. TO SEE. YOU BOB. TO BE

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:13.178
ABLE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS BUT

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.813
WE ALSO NEED TO. NOT DOWN THE

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.450
BARRIERS SO I THINK. AREAS THAT

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.719
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ONE IS

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.554
THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES I THINK

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.523
THERE NEEDS TO BE- ONE OF

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.625
THINGS WE LOOK AT IN

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.660
AFFORDABILITY OF FIRST POLICIES

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.629
IS THERE THERE'S A GREAT

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.631
DISPARITY. IN THE- FOR THE FOR

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.833
YOUR STUDENTS VERSUS THE TO

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.635
YOUR STUDENTS SO WHILE WE HAVE

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:42.541
LOW TUITION. THE COST OF- JUST

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.141
BEING ABLE TO LIVE TO GET TO

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:46.678
SCHOOL IS SO HIGH FOR THE

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.245
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.680
WHEREAS EVEN AT. THE COST OF

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.682
EDUCATION IS HIGHER FOR THE FOR

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:54.586
YOUR STUDENTS THEY HAVE ACCESS

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.421
TO OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:56.955
THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.624
STUDENTS ARE PROFANITY HAVING.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.157
SO WHAT ARE THINGS WE TALK

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:02.527
ABOUT ALSO ACROSS. AT THE

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.596
SYSTEM WIDE LEVELS HOW DO WE

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.598
CREATE SORT OF WHAT IS THE BASS

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.800
LINE THAT IS NEEDED FOR ALL

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.401
STUDENTS JUST TO GET THROUGH

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:12.304
SCHOOL AND THEN HOW DO WE

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.673
EQUALIZED- THE ACCESS TO

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.575
RESOURCES FOR ALL OF OUR

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:18.844
STUDENTS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.547
TO ME THAT- FOR YOUR STUDENT.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.349
WE RECOGNIZE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:28.387
THE STUDENTS WHO FOR YEARS TO-

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.689
BE ABLE TO GET FINANCIAL

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:34.459
ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR THING-

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.561
DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.463
FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.666
STUDENTS MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:44.403
THINK THEY'RE ALL OF HOME BUT

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:45.003
IN REALITY. NO THEY'RE NOT AND

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:50.342
A LOT OF THEM. TO READ THE SEE.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:50.976
A LOT OF RETURNING STUDENTS WE

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.577
HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:53.111
JOBS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:56.314
THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION SO I

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.383
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT- HOW

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.619
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CHANGE FOR

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.153
COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND THEN

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.387
EQUALIZE FROM THAT ACTS. SOME

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:02.988
CHANGE IN OUR LEGISLATION IT

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.890
NEEDS TO BE SOME CHANGE IN OUR

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:08.393
CULTURE. I RECENTLY- SENATE

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.962
BILL TWO NINETY ONE AND GOT. US

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:12.631
THROUGH WORD EIGHT IT INCREASED

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:14.566
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:16.435
BEING GIVEN TO STUDENTS WHICH-

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.603
I REALLY APPLAUD LEGISLATORS

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.137
ARE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.472
AGAIN FOR THAT. BUT WE ALSO

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.741
NEED TO CHANGE THE PELL GRANTS

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.543
THERE'S SO MANY RESTRICTIONS ON

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:28.747
THAT IT'S SUCH A DAUNTING

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.615
PROCESS FOR STUDENTS TO GO

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:31.216
THROUGH. AND ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.551
WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN. BEFORE AND

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:33.085
AFTER FALLOUT MOUNDS OF

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.686
PAPERWORK- AND RECENTLY ONE OF

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.688
THINGS WE DID AND IN THE

00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:38.557
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM UNDER

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.492
THE JOINT CAUCUSES WHICH ARE AT

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.059
THE ASIAN AMERICANS AFRICAN

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.661
AMERICANS LATINOS IN THE

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:46.631
VETERANS. IS WE PUSH FOR THE

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.333
SEGREGATION OF THE DATA SO.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.535
MANY TIMES AND WE FEEL THAT

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:51.036
ESPECIALLY IN THE ASIAN

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:54.406
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE-

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:56.808
OFTEN WE THINK ASIAN AMERICANS.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:23:00.312
NO NO PROBLEM GREAT STUDENTS

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:02.714
MODEL MINORITY. BUT IT'S NOT.

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:04.549
SO MUCH IN THIS GROUP THERE'S

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.384
LOTS OF DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS IN

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.453
ASIAN AMERICAN JUSTICE WE SEE

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.020
AN AFRICAN AMERICANS NOW THE

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:10.622
DEMOGRAPHICS OF CHANGING. AND

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:14.793
THE LATINOS IT'S NOT ALL NOT

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.393
EVERYBODY COMES MEXICO THEY

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.628
COME FROM ALL OVER FROM

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.663
DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO NOW

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.398
WE'RE JUST AGGREGATING THE DATA

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.534
SO THAT WE CAN START TO DO IS

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.536
TO UNCOVER. SOME OF THOSE

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:25.137
GROUPS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.838
BEEN HIDDEN MARK YOU SO THAT WE

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.573
CAN BETTER SERVE PROCESS- NEED

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.709
ACCESS. SO PAPA ONE OF THIS

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:34.446
PART OF THIS IS LEGISLATION THE

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.515
OTHER TASK FORCE I FOR SERVED

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:42.621
ON THREE YEARS AGO- THERE'S

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:43.188
BEEN CHANGING HAS BEEN THE-

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:46.658
WORK. THAT'S WHERE HE- YES WHEN

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:47.259
I RAN FOR THE COLLEGE BOARD I

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:50.529
ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT. NOT COMING

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.664
TO COLLEGE JUST TO GET AN

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.265
EDUCATION TO HAVE A PIECE OF

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.399
PAPER IN YOUR HAND YOU CAME TO

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:56.735
COLLEGE TO GET THAT PIECE OF

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.270
PAPER BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED IT

00:23:58.336 --> 00:23:58.837
WAS A KEY FOR YOU TO GET A

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:00.672
BETTER JOB. AND THAT I THINK IS

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.841
THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF EVERYONE

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.709
SO THIS BIFURCATION WE SEE IN

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:08.380
OUR OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM OF HOW

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.916
WE BY FOR KATE A STUDENT WHO IS

00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:12.651
GOING FOR WORK. CAN AGREE

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:13.218
YOU'RE GETTING A CERTIFICATE

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.020
VERSUS ONE WHO'S GETTING A FOUR

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.621
YEAR DEGREE AND BEING ABLE TO

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.423
TRAVEL ALL THE WAY ON THAT FOUR

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.425
YEAR I'M TRAJECTORY IS OP I

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:22.594
THINK THAT MEANS WE NEED TO THE

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:24.663
LINES ARE. TRULY IN REAL LIFE

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:28.500
BEING BLURRED AND WE NEED TO

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.635
ACCEPT THAT IT'S REALLY THE

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:34.372
SAME STUDENT THEY JUST HAVE.

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:34.873
TAPPED FOR TIMELINES BUT

OF THEIR EDUCATION OUR INITIAL

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.374
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FOUND

00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.876

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.002

IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE ON TWO

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.778

TO LEGISLATURE ASK FOR MORE

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.518

DOCUMENTS TO BE VERIFIED AND

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:04.468
MANY TIMES OF STUDENTS THEN HAD

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.670
TO FIND WAYS TO PAY FOR THE

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.539
REGISTRATION OR HAD TO GO OUT

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.541
AND GET A VOUCHER FOR A LOAN

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:11.108
FROM THE SCHOOL TO PAY FOR

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:12.609
THEIR BOOKS. AND HAD TO REPEAT

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.545
IT BACK ONCE THEY GOT THEIR

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:18.315
FINANCIAL AID- SO THESE ARE

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.484
SMALL THINGS IS A CULTURE

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.453
CHANGES THAT WE CAN WE CAN MAKE

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.421
SO IT WAS EMBARRASSING FOR US

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:26.390
TO LOOK AT THAT TO REALIZE IT

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:28.459
BUT IT ALSO WAS A GOOD. A FLAG

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:30.661
FOR US TO THEN SAY THERE'S SOME

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.396
THINGS WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.498
AND STUDENTS HIMSELF CAME UP

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.099
WITH SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:38.735
LIKE PUT PEER TO PEER MENTORING

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:40.504
HAVE A LITTLE A STUDY CENTER SO

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.339
THAT STUDENTS COMMAND AND THEY

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.508
HAVE THEY NEED ASSISTANCE OF

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.042
FINANCIAL AID. INSTEAD OF

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:48.345
HAVING TO GO TO AN ADULT WHICH

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.514
THEY MAY BE RELUCTANT TO DO

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.115
THEY HAVE HERE THAT WILL COME

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.585
IN AND HELP THEM GET THROUGH

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.787

TIME SERVING STUDENTS AND WE

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.731
NEED TO BE. MINDFUL WHEN WE

OUR- FIRST AREA MANY COLLEGES.

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:51.141
BECAUSE MOST VEGAS ACADEMICS

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.776
BUT YOU KNOW WITH ALL OF THE

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:53.377

PFAFF THE COMPLETION DISCOVER

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.600
MANDATORY PART AS THE- IN A

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.535
REGULAR ENROLLMENT PROCESS IS

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:24.641
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:25.275
BE DOING UNIVERSALLY AND SYSTEM

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:27.044
WIDE. I DO IMPACT WOULD BE I DO

HAVE TALKED TO THE CHANCELLOR

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.416
OF ONE OF THE COLLEGES AND WHEN

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:34.885
THEY GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL THEY

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:36.520
JUST TELL THE HIGH SCHOOL

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:37.120
STUDENTS WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.822
WANT TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.591
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE

TO IF YOU MAKE A DECISION ON

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.434
THE ASSET IS A REALLY LONG

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.034
PROCESS AND I JUST HEARD ONE

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:54.638
STUDENTS SAY THAT SHE- TOOK A

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.340
FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET THROUGH

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:56.974
BECAUSE IT WAS AUTOMATED WAS SO

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.310
FAST. BUT I TALKED TO

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:04.348
CONGREGATE CHEF. JUST STARTING

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:08.452
COLLEGE AND HE SAID IT WAS A

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:12.556
DAUNTING PROCESS AS IT CAN'T

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.791
COME A WILL TO HELP HER FIGURE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:18.562
ADDED TO THIS AND- I. WISH THAT.

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:24.434
WE SAW. A LOT PAUL FIGURE SO

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.470
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT ONE OF

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.372
START CONGRESSMAN HAVE TIME

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:28.939
HELPING IS DAUGHTER HOW HOW

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:29.473
DAUNTING THIS MUST BE FOR

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:30.741
STUDENTS SO I DO THINK THAT THE

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.709
EARLIER WE CAN GET- STUDENTS TO

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.311
DO THIS I THINK- AND TAKE OFF

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:34.978
SIR THE STIGMA OF OKAY MAYBE IT

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:35.612
WASN'T YOUR FOR SURE JUST WHAT

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:36.813
HAD FELT THE PAPERWORK AND GET

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.749
YOURSELF READY. I THINK THOSE

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.484
MAYBE THINGS THAT COULD BE FOR.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.719
AND THEN I. YOU TALKED A LITTLE

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:46.556
BIT ABOUT- ABOUT SOME DATA GAPS

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:46.990
IN TERMS OF THAT THE

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.692
INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:52.362
ACCESS TO- YOU KNOW WHAT- KIND

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:52.929
OF THEM. THEN THIS CRITICAL

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.998
GATE DATA GAPS HOW CAN WE CLOSE

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:58.869
THEM. AND WITH THAT INFORMATION

00:48:58.935 --> 00:48:59.369
HOW CAN WE CREATE MORE

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:04.608
TRANSPARENCY. FOR STUDENTS AND

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.576
FOR POTENTIAL BORROWERS. OKAY

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:10.280
AS PART OF THAT SURE- SO.

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.716
CALLOUS THE HIGHER ED SEGMENTS

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.818
AND THE STUDENT AID SEGMENT WE

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.320
WE'VE LIVED IN DATA SILOS FOR

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:18.522
QUITE AWHILE NOW- AT AND I

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:20.590
THINK. WE NOW HAVE AN

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.124
ADMINISTRATION WHO IS VERY

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.628
EAGER TO- ADVANCE BECAUSE OF

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:30.567
DATA SHARING AND YOU KNOW A LOT

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.134
OF DATA WE DO HAVE IT'S JUST

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:32.502
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A- SHARE

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:33.070
THIS GOVERNOR HAS BEGUN THE

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:36.640
PROCESS OF DOING THE CREDIT.

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:37.307
WHICH WERE VERY MUCH GOING TO

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:38.842
BE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.510
DONE AND WITHOUT SIMPLE THINGS

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.779
LIKE YOU KNOW IN THE STUDENT

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.448
AID OF. DATA SAID. IN A WAY

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.817
WHERE YOU GO FOR THE STUDENTS

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:48.885
WHO DID NOT TAKE A CAL GRANT OF

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.721
WHICH THERE'S A DECENT AMOUNT

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:51.321
OF STUDENTS WHO DO NOT TAKE A

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.589
CAL GRANT WILL GET BACK TO

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.691
LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. WE

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.660
DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WENT OR

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:58.495
WHAT WAS THE BLOCKADE BEHIND

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.096
THAT SO JUST SIMPLY MATCHING

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.697
WITH ENTITIES LIKE SHE ISSUE IN

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:04.401
YOU SEE- THE NATIONAL STUDENT

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.670
CLEARINGHOUSE TO FIND OUT OKAY

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:08.438
DID THEY LEAVE CALIFORNIA. ARE

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:10.841
THEY NOT IN COLLEGE ANYWHERE

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:11.441
CAN WE MATCHING THE EDT DATA

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:14.544
FILES THEY'RE WORKING HOW MUCH

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:16.680
THEY WORKING JUST SIMPLY SIMPLY

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.515
TRACKING TO GET A HAND ON. THE

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:22.753
DAY. OF. METRICS OF BOTH

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:23.286
ACCOUNTABILITY AND STUDENT

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:23.887
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:26.723
WOULD HELP GREATLY. THE OTHER

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.625
THING I MENTIONED TO WAS WE

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.527
NEED TO HAVE A SINGLE PLACE

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.696
WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THE ENTIRE

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.498
STUDENT LOAN FINANCING PACKAGE

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:36.400
RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE A SILO

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:37.000
LIKE HERE'S THE FEDERAL DATA

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.769
HERE'S THE STATE DATA. HERE'S

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.871
THE LOCAL FINANCIAL AID HERE

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.706
THE SCHOLARSHIPS THEY GOT

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.541
HERE'S THE WORK STUDY BUT WE

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.343
DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PLACE WE

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.578
CAN EXAMINE ALL OF THIS

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:49.179
SINGULARLY IN HOLISTICALLY TO

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:50.981
FIND OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.916
MANAGE ALL OF THIS. THOSE TO ME

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.518
ARE THE TWO BIGGEST DATA GAPS I

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:55.118
MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:58.455
SUIT. WHO YOU KNOW THE WHAT WE

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:00.390
CALL THE PAID RATE FOR CAL

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:00.991
GRANT IS NOT AS HIGH AS WE

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.826
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE THERE'S A

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.661
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.262
WHO WERE. WHO GET A CAL GRANT

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.730
LETTER SAYING HERE'S FREE MONEY

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.398
AND THEY DON'T TAKE IT- THAT

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.434
MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE AND WE

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.101
ACTUALLY DON'T. REALLY KNOW WHY

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:12.969
THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT TAKING

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:15.138
IT ARE THEY GOING OUT OF STATE

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.273
OR ARE THERE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:18.508
ISSUES THAT CAMPUSES THAT WE

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.610
COULD FIGURE OUT. IT EASIER FOR

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:22.612
THEM TO GET IT- WE'VE GOT TO

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:24.648
START WITHOUT. SOURCE LEAVING

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:28.385
FEDERAL MONEY ON ON THE TABLE-

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.454
GOOD COMMENTS ALREADY. YOU KNOW

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.722
WHAT. YOU DID SEE SOME STATES

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.591
RIGHT NOW WHO ARE ON. FULLY TO

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:36.426
MAKE. THAT HIGH SCHOOL

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:37.060
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. OKAY I

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.562
THINK TENNESSEE HAS DONE. I AM

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.831
THIS IS KIND OF AN EXTREME

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.399
THING- AND YOU DO HAVE SOME

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:42.999
CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WILL

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:46.470
VOLUNTARILY DONE US. I KNOW SEE

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:47.037
SEXUALLY RUNS A COMPETITION

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.005
WHERE WE REWARD HIGH SCHOOLS

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:51.174
WHO HAVE VERY HIGH FAST OF

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.609
COMPLETION RATES. SO I WOULD

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.978
START WITH JUST SIMPLY MAKING

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.680
THAT A VERY. POPULAR OF HI

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.915
PUBLIC VIEW METRIC I'M NOT.

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:01.017
SAYING WHAT'S YOU KNOW PUT

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:01.618
ACCOUNTABILITY ON IT YET BUT

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.421
THE EDUCATION WORK THAT WE DO.

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:19.055
SO WHEN WE STARTED TO GET THE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.623
INFORMATION WE FOUND- THE

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:24.360
CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING-

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:26.729
HAS. FOUND THAT A FOR PROFIT

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:30.400
SCHOOLS IMPACT- LOW INCOME

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:32.435
FAMILIES THE MOST WOMEN IN

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.604
AFRICAN AMERICANS AND SO WHEN

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.706
WE STARTED TO LOOK AT SOME OF

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:37.206
THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:38.841
AVAILABLE SOME OF THE DATA

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.543
PIECES- WE FOUND THAT THE

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.480
MAJORITY 40% OF THE STUDENTS-

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:45.014
THAT ARE ATTENDING THE FOR

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:48.418
PROFIT COLLEGES. ARE NOT JUST

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.018
FOR PROFIT COLLEGES BUT THERE

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.954
THERE. NOT THE HIGHEST RANKING

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.022
SCHOOLS AND SO THEY'RE ENDING

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:56.392
UP WITH STUDENT DEBT SOME OF

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:56.893
THEM ARE NOT GRADUATING

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.463
COMPLETING A DEGREE OR ARE

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.030
UNABLE TO SECURE AND STABLE

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.534
EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT THAT WILL

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.134
GENERATE THE INCOME NEEDED TO

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:08.671
PAY THE DEBT. AND SO. AS WE

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.640
WERE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.274
STORIES AND SOME OF THE CASES

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:14.344
THAT WE HAD I'M STARTING IN

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.946
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:17.580
THE SCHOOLS WHEN MANY OF THE

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:18.648
PRIVATE SCHOOL STARTED TO

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.783
CLOSE. OUR WHAT WE WERE FINDING

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.719
IS THAT THE STUDENTS WERE AT A

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.887
LOSS CITY GENERALLY RECEIVED A

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.589
LETTER IN THE MAIL WITH VERY

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.658
LITTLE INSTRUCTION AND SO OUR

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.626
INVESTIGATORS ARE CONSUMER

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:32.295
ADVOCATES- THEN HAD TO SUPPORT

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:34.497
WITH GUIDANCE IN NAVIGATING-

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.666
WHETHER IT WAS. DIRECTLY WITH

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.668
THE SCHOOL OR WITH CREDIT

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.737
BUREAUS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.705
OPTIONS WERE TO DISSOLVE- THE

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.674
DEBT THAT THEY HAD AND KURT SO

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.709
WE KNOW THAT TO THEIR ENTERING

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.444
THE SCHOOLS AT A HIGHER RATE

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.078
AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR LEAVING

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.482
THE SCHOOLS WITH HIGHER DEBT.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:53.116
AND MANY TIMES ARE NOT SECURING

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:54.817
ARMS I QUIT PAYING JOBS IN

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:58.321
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REPAY I

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.390
HAVEN'T THE DEBT. AS DONATION

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:00.990
MENTIONED IDENTITY THEFT IS

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:04.394
ALSO A BIG FACTOR IT IS ANOTHER

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.629
A SECTOR IN TERMS OF OUR

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:10.400
CASELOAD THAT COMES IN- FOLKS

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:14.537
THAT FEEL LIKE SOMEONE. ATTEND

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.138
HOUSEHOLD ARMY MAY HAVE USED

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.773
THEIR IDENTITY TO SECURE THAT.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.708
ARM AND SO THOSE AGAIN CASES

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.510
THAT ARE VERY PREVALENT. I'M A

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.779
BIG SOURCE IN A BIG NUMBER OF

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.781
THE CASES THAT WE WERE SEEING-

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.649
LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER WERE

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.651
AROUND SCAMS. AND SO

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.787
UNFORTUNATELY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.855
AND SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:36.392
ARE WE HAVE FOLKS IT-

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.428
VALIDATING SOME OF THESE. THESE

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.830
AGENCIES THAT ALLEGE THEY CAN

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.765
SECURE- DEBT FORGIVENESS FOR

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.967
THE STUDENTS AND THEY DON'T

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.803
KNOW THAT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.404
DOING IS ENTERING INTO

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:50.573
FORBEARANCE SO IF THE STUDENT

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.508
AND THE BORROWER IS LUCKY THEY

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.544
WILL CALL US FIRST TO VERIFY IF

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.579
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE COMPANY-

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.115
BUT MOST TIMES ARE CALLING ONCE

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.783
THEY'VE ALREADY SIGNED SOME

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.585
SORT OF CONTRACT. AND ARE

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.687
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.522
OPTIONS ARE NOW- THE OTHER

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.724
PIECE TO ALSO CONSIDER IS THAT

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.593
WANTS TO STUDENTS MAYBE THEY

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.562
WERE ON THE RIGHT PATH FOR A

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.597
DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM BUT

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.532
ONCE YOU'VE SIGNED ON TO A

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.534
DIFFERENT PROGRAM. WHAT ARE THE

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.168
THINGS YOU DO IS YOU GIVE UP

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.603
YOUR RIGHTS TO GO BACK AND SO

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.872
AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.874
1% IT'S ACTUALLY ABLE TO TAKE

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.709
ADVANTAGE OF THE DEBT

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.711
FORGIVENESS. IT BECOMES VERY

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.813
SMALL AND WE START TO THINK

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.648
ABOUT I'M THE ACCESS TO

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:34.484
INFORMATION AND WHO ACTUALLY

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.719
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS ADVOCATES

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.387
TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.523
SYSTEMS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.458
THE DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.627
MAKING SO. AGAIN AS VIC DOT

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.729
THINKING ABOUT YOUR IN A

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.299
VULNERABLE SITUATION YOU ARE.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.568
TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.470
RESOURCES TO HELP SUPPORT I'M

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.004
FINE NOW SITUATION AT THE

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:58.741
MOMENT BUT LONG TERM YOU END UP

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.610
IN A MUCH- MORE SEVERE

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.545
COMMISSION BECAUSE NOW CREDIT

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:03.112
SCORE PROBABLY IMPACTED. THE

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.547
OPTIONS ARE MUCH MORE LIMITED

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.415
IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR APARTMENT

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:10.319
CAN ACTUALLY DO AT THAT POINT

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.755
SO WE HAD SUCCESS RATES WITH

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:18.528
SCHOOLS. WERE WE CLOSING

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:19.128

NINETY BORDER THERE'S HI THE

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.662
FACT THAT RISEN FROM THE DEAD

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.751
CRACKING DOWN ON SOME DECEPTIVE

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.486
MARKETING PRACTICES. I'M I

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.555
THINK THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.824
THAT THOSE WILL BE REINTRODUCED

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.692
THIS SESSION EITHER HIM. FROM

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.427
THE PREVIOUS AUTHORS ARE OR BY

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.563
OTHER AUTHORS AND- I'M JUST I

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:42.832
THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED. A LOT

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.533
HAS HAPPENED SUPPORT TO MAKE

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.270
SURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.539
ADVOCATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.341
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO MAKE

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:52.975
PROGRESS ON THAT AREA BECAUSE-

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.744
I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT. SO

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.545
MANY THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.347
YOU. IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.316
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THESE FOR

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:02.385
PROFIT COLLEGES AND- I THINK

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:04.453
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE AS A

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.489
LEGISLATURE. AND AS POLICY

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:10.493
MAKERS CAN DO. I INCHED HER

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.093
THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.728
FROM. US THIS AMP EQUALLY

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.764
PRESS. A PRACTICE SAYS. ON IT

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.665
IN ADDITION TO AYE THINKS

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.701
LEGISLATIVE STEPS. I FEEL LIKE

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:22.505
WE CAN ALSO DO MORE. TO GIVE

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.172
POTENTIAL BORROWERS JUST BETTER

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:26.475
INFORMATION ABOUT. THE QUALITY

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.744
OF THE PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.513
ENTERING INTO WHETHER THAT'S-

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.481
DEFAULT RATES ARE AND- EARNING

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:38.554
RIGHT. I'M YOU AS YOU TALK TO

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.623
CONSUMER AS YOU TALK TO PEOPLE

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.190
HAVE BEEN DO YOU. FROM YOUR

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.493
FIRST OF WHAT CAN I. DO TO GIVE

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.796
PEOPLE BETTER INFORMATION AND

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:50.733
HELP THEM MAKE CHOICES NOT ALL

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.670
RATE THE SCAM. SO WHEN THINGS

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.572
AREN'T THAT THE CFE THERE ARE

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.206
WAS SUPPOSED A SERIES OF FOCUS

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.674
GROUPS. AND SO WE WERE LOOKING

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.376
AT HIGH COST LOANS SPECIFICALLY

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.010
UP AS THEY THINK ABOUT SOME OF

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.611
THE LESSONS WE TOOK AWAY FROM

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:03.212
THAT- DONATION YOU CAN SPEAK

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.747
MORE TO THAT IS. WHAT WE HEARD

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:08.350
BACK VERY CLEARLY IS THE- A

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.953
MARKETING STRATEGY THAT FOCUSES

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.488
ON THE INTEREST RATE OR THAT

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.523
FOCUSES AND FEELS LIKE IT'S A

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.559
SHAMING TACTIC. IS NOT

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.092
EFFECTIVE AND SO BECAUSE

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.594
OPTIONS IN MOST OF THESE

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:22.264
COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY LIMITED

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:24.467
THEY'RE VERY AWARE- THAT THIS

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.502
IS PROBABLY THE ONLY ACCESS

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.671
POINT THAT THEY HAVE TO HIGHER

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:29.305
EDUCATION WHICH IS WHAT THEY'VE

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:32.274
BEEN TOLD RIGHT. GO TO SCHOOL

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:32.942
YOU'LL HAVE HIGHER YOU'LL EARN

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.777
HIGHER INCOME- BUT WHAT WE'RE

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.612
AT THE PART THAT WE'RE NOT

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:37.046
HAVING A VERY CLEAR

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.714
CONVERSATION ABOUT IS THE DEBT

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.384
THAT COMES AFTER THAT-

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:42.852
CHALLENGES WITH MAYBE

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.720
GRADUATING. AND SO WE CAN FIND

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.624
THE RIGHT- THE RIGHT TALKING

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:49.225
POINTS IN THE RIGHT MESSAGING

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:52.528
TO REALLY CONVEY TO STUDENTS.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:53.128
I'M ABOUT WHAT THEIR OPTIONS

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:54.797
TRULY ARE IT COMES FROM A VERY

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:56.765
DIFFERENT PLACE DIFFERENT FROM

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.767
OUR CONCERNS AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:00.703
INTEREST RATES AND FEES. I'M AN

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:04.673
INCOME IS THAT SADDAM. CAN WE

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.475
THINK ABOUT HOW TO DELAY THAT-

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.746
AN- IMMEDIATE NEED FOR A DEGREE

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.581
YOU KNOW IS IT A FOUR MONTH

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.182
PROGRAM IS THAT IT WHEN YOU'RE

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:16.619
PROGRAM. CAN THINK OTHER

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.387
STRATEGIES TO REALLY HELP

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.389
MAXIMIZE THE STUDENT'S

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:26.395
POTENTIAL I'M NOT A GET LOSE

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.964
MONEY IN THE PROCESS. AND WE

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:32.668
THINK WE HEARD A LOT. THE PHOTO

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.904
IS. LIKE WAS DESIGNED FOR THEM

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:35.504
WHICH IS VERY SHOCKING RIGHT

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.705
BECAUSE WE THINK ABOUT THOSE

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:37.306
PLACES AS YOU KNOW QUICK YOU

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:39.141
COME IN FIVE MINUTES THE ASK

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.676
VERY LITTLE QUESTIONS THEY JUST

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:41.310
WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOME

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.978
SORT OF IN COM MAYBE IT'S THEIR

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:46.348
STUDENT LOAN CHECK THAT IS YOU

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.617
KNOW COUNTING AS AS THAT SOURCE

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.486
OF INCOME AND SO WE THINK ABOUT

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:50.953
DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.755
CAMPAIGNS THAT HELP GET THAT TO

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.423
THE STUDENTS WE ALSO LEARNED

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.926
THAT THERE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.394
RECEIVE THE INFORMATION FROM

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.896
TRUSTED SOURCES SO ARE THEY

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.500
PART OF ALREADY CONNECTED TO A

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:05.134
SCHOOL ARE THE PART IT MAY BE A

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.902
CHURCH OR THEY- WERE NOT.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.940
AFFECT HOW DO WE THE MESSAGING

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:14.476
TO THEM IN THIS IS A. STATE IS

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.110
YOU KNOW AT. THE BUS SHELTER OR

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:15.711
AT THE TRAIN SO THINKING ABOUT

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.212
WAYS IN WHICH WE MAXIMIZE SOME

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.081
OF OUR MARKETING DOLLARS TO

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:22.685
REALLY HIT THE MESSAGE HOME.

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:23.252
AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:24.987
PROGRAMS THAT THAT YOU HAVE

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.956
ROTH AND IMPLEMENTED THAT YOU

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.457
FEEL HAVE BEEN MOST ACTIVE. IN

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.693
TERMS OF THE HIGH COST LOANS

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.962
RIGHT NOW WE'RE AN EXPLORATORY

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:36.365
PHASE AND SO WE ARE DOING SOME

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:36.966
HOMEWORK WITH SOME ARE FOR NOT

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:40.302
NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO EXPLORE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:40.836
WHAT ARE AT AN ATTENTIONAL

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:44.473
PRODUCTS. ODD LOAN PRODUCTS FOR

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.074
SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS AND SO

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.575
THERE'S A FEW NOT LOCAL

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.744
NONPROFITS TRUSTWORTHY

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.446
NONPROFITS THAT ARE PILOTING-

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:54.350
LOW COST INTEREST RATE LOANS I

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:54.917
ONE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE IS

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.785
FOCUSED ON SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.520
ARE THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

01:10:58.587 --> 01:10:59.021
MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.756
TRADITIONAL CAPITAL AND THEY

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:04.526
CAP THEY'RE INTERESTED 8% ARE

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.462
WE HAVE ANOTHER NONPROFIT

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.530
PARTNER ARMED THAT PARTNERED

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.131
WITH THE FIN TECH COMPANY IS

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:10.833
EXPLORING WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.935
TO. AND THEY WOULDN'T CALL IT

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:16.705
FINANCING BUT SUPPORTING A

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.607
BARBER TO REPAY BACK. I EIGHTY

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.809
LOANS AND HAVING AN INTEREST

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:21.377
RATE ALSO FIXED ON THAT OR

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.778
MODELING IT LIKE A SAVINGS

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.513
PROGRAM. AND SO WE THINK THAT

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.482
THERE'S FOLKS OUT THERE THERE

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:27.116
ARE DOING CREATIVE THINGS WE

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.817
JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.486
GOVERNMENT CAN FIT IN THAT

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.554
EQUATION DO WE SUPPORT IT IS

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.690
IT'S A SUSTAINABLE IN THAT WAY

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.525
OR IS THERE A PRODUCT. THAT AS

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.427
A COUNTY AGENCY WE CAN LOOK AT

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.429
EXPLORING AND CREATING. AND I

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.931
WOULD ADD THAT THE COUNTY IS A

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:43.565
MINIMUM WAGE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.769
INCREDIBLE ACTIVE ARE HONEST

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.369
WORK FAIR CAMPAIGN. AND WHAT

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:48.971
HAS MADE THAT SO ACTIVE IS OUR

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.873
ABILITY TO LEVERAGE LOCAL

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.675
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO WE

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.476
WANTED TO INFORM. LA COUNTY

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:56.812

JUST RELYING ON OUR OWN VOICE

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:01.317
TO GET THE WORD OUT THE

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:04.620
BUILDING A CADRE. OF DOZENS OF

GOING BACK TO THE TRUSTED

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.661
MESSENGER APPROACH. AND THEN

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.730
FROM THE OTHER PANEL WE TALKED

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:15.364
A BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.665
LEAVING. SO MUCH MONEY ON THE

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.634
TABLE AS A STATE. AND AS YOU

FOLKS THAT COME TO YOU THEY

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.571

THOUGH IT'S THE NATION'S

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.470
LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM

RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT FIVE

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:57.272
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

MONEY BACK INTO THE HANDS OF

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:07.082

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.773
RELYING ON CONSTITUENTS TO COME

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:34.409
TO US CAN ASK QUESTIONS BUT US

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:35.010
LEVERAGING WHATEVER RESOURCES

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.478
WE HAVE TO PUSH OUT CONTENT.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.112
YEAH AND THE TIME THAT I WOULD

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:39.114
MAKE BACK IS PART OF WHAT WE'VE

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.582
HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.351
PARTNERS. IS THAT WE CAN

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.453
SUPPORT OUR REGION WE CAN.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.455
IMPROVE OUR MARKETING BUT THEN

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.457
ALSO SUPPORTING THE CAPACITY

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.325
BUILDING ON THE BACKEND SO THAT

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:50.926
THEY CAN ACTUALLY ABSORB THE

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:54.630
INFLUX OF NEW FILERS AND SO AS

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.632
I THINK ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IS

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.333
ARE WE DOING A GOOD. JOB OF

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.469
INFORMING PEOPLE AREN'T WE CAN

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:01.036
PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.840
DOING THAT BUT THEN ALSO HOW DO

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:06.508
WE TRAIN AND WORK WITH. HIGH

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:07.142
SCHOOL KIDS SLIPPERS MAYBE IT'S

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.911
A COLLEGE COUNTS. TO IMPROVE

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.546
PASSED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.347
THAT SURE THIS IS JUST A FORM

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.817
BUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHETHER

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:15.317
THAT STUDENT FILLED OUT

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.718
CORRECTLY OR NOT. GOES FAR

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.754
GREATER THAN JUST YOU KNOW

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.421
THOSE FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THEY

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.689
GET TO SPEND WITH THE STUDENT.

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.791
AND SO THAT IT'S REALLY

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.359
IMPORTANT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.762
THE IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:30.566
THIS VERY MOMENT WITH THE

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.434
STUDENT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR BUT

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.336
THEN LONG TERM THEIR GRADUATION

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:34.970
RATES THE- FACT. THAT THEY WILL

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:38.607
CARRY FORWARD AND SO I THINK

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.742
THERE'S WORK THAT WE CAN

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:44.680
DEFINITELY DO DO I. BY ALLIED

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:45.247
TO CAN HELP SUPPORT IN THIS

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.884
EFFORT. AND THEN. WE TALKED

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.819
ABOUT THE- ISSUE AB RIGHT

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.588
SWITCH YOUR YOU'VE BEEN A

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:53.121
SPONSOR. I HAVE AND I KNOW

WITH AROUND THE 36% CAP AND SO

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.586
HOW DO WE THINK JUSTICE

THERE OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.545
LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE. AND THE

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.613
HUGE GAP THAT WE HAVE REALLY

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.482
GIVEN BY THE ACTIONS OF THE

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:56.350
INACTION. OF THE TRUMP

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:56.918
ADMINISTRATION AND ARE THERE

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.519
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:02.723
AND SAY THAT IS. IT A PRIORITY

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.224
THAT WE URGENTLY NEED TO

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:06.861
ADDRESS NEXT YEAR. I CAN SPEAK

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:10.731
AT LEAST TO THE FOR PROFIT PEAS

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.934
AS I AYE FORESHADOWED A LITTLE

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.568
BIT. TWENTY TWENTY IS GOING TO

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:16.971
BE SUNSET REVIEW. EURO AT THAT

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.806
DOES REPRESENTS OPPORTUNITY TO

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:20.842
REALLY DO SOME ASSESSMENTS OF

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.543
HOW OVERSIGHT IS BEING

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:23.177
CONDUCTED FOR THESE VULNERABLE

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.645
COMMUNITY. WELLS WHAT

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:26.480
PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE IN PLACE-

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:28.649
I THINK THAT THIS YEAR THERE

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.718
ARE ACTUALLY I TALKED ABOUT

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.887
THREE BILLS BUT THERE WERE

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:33.554
OTHER BILLS THAT RELATED TO FOR

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:36.591
PROFIT EDUCATION- AND I THINK

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:37.124
THAT THOSE BILLS OFFER. A

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:40.695
REALLY- GOOD PLACE TO START IN

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.563
TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE BUILT

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.966
ON OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:50.438
THERE WAS. BILL ONLINE. THE

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:51.005
NINETY TEN FULL THERE WAS A

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.840
BILL ON THEIR TWO BILLS ON

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:53.407
CONVERSIONS SO- COVERT FOR

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.842
PROFITS OR OR FOR PROFITS THAT

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.577
ARE CONVERTING TO BECOME NON

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:58.646
PROFITS. AS WELL AS- NONPROFITS

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.248
BEING PURCHASED BY FOR PROFIT

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:02.717
SO- THERE ARE THOSE WERE A LOT

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.485
OF IDEAS I THINK ALSO WE

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.954
STARTED THE BALL ROLLING WE'VE

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.489
TALKED A LOT ABOUT DATING APPS

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.758
TODAY- THIRTEEN FORTY ASSEMBLY

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.693
MEMBER CHOOSE BILL STARTED TOOK

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.795
A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.731
CLOSING SOME OF THOSE DATA GAPS

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.466
BY MAKING. OUTCOMES DATA

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.066
AVAILABLE LIKE I SAY FOR THE

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.868
FIRST TIME THE STUDENTS AT FOR

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:22.503
PROFIT SCHOOLS I THINK THAT

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.572
THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:26.407
POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT COULD WE

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.409
RECREATE SOMETHING LIKE THE

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.076
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT LOVE RULE AT

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.711
THE STATE LEVEL. AND THAT WAS

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:32.680
ORIGINALLY PART OF THAT BILL-

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.515
AND I THINK IS A REALLY

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:36.584
PROMISING IDEA GOING FORWARD

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:37.151
COULD WE DO SOMETHING LIKE

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.753
BORROWED DEFENSE AT THE STATE

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.788
LEVEL SO THERE ARE THESE THESE

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:42.723
OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.592
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:46.327
HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK. FOR

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.562
CALIFORNIA REALLY STEPPED

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.731
FORWARD- I THINK THOSE ARE ALL

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:54.769
ALL IDEAS THAT. SEE IN TWENTY

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.771
TWENTY. AND I'VE I'VE GOT MY

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.372
PERSPECTIVE I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:58.973
YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOUR Y. HIVE

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.341
WE ENCOUNTERED IT'S LIKE YOU

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.343
SAID I THINK THAT THE FOR

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.612
PROFIT PACKAGE WAS TEN BELLS

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:05.179
MAY BE ALIVE AND SO. IT WAS

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.614
SEVEN OKAY. SO YOU KNOW. THREE

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.883
OF THEM THREE OF THEM MADE IT

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.785
THROW. WHY DO YOU THINK WE'VE

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:14.689
ENCOUNTERED. SUCH CHALLENGES

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:15.323
WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING FOR

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:16.424
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS HERE THE

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:20.661
FORMULA- I THINK. IT IS- IT'S A

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.630
SEGMENT OF STUDENTS THAT HASN'T

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.565
HISTORICALLY PATRICK MENTIONED

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.500
SEILING EARLIER I THINK THAT

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.703
THAT. OFTEN WE TEND TO FOCUS ON

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.771
DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF EDUCATION

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.440
AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:38.479
CALIFORNIA. I AM REALLY EXCITED.

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:39.080
HERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE TALK. THE

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:40.614
RIVER SEINE. HARM THAT IS

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:41.248
HAPPENED STUDENTS OF FOR PROFIT

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:42.650
SCHOOLS I THINK THAT THERE IS-

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:43.284
MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO IT

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.019
I THINK THAT THIS WAS A BIG

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:45.653
YOU'D LIKE TWENTY NINETEEN WITH

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.654
A HUGE SEVEN IS A HUGE NUMBER

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.689
OF BILLS ON THIS TOPIC SO- I

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:50.658
THINK THERE WAS A LOT. MORE

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:52.893
ATTENTION PAID AND I THINK THAT

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.562
AS WE LEARN AS THOSE FOLKS

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:56.430
LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND

01:33:56.497 --> 01:34:00.468
BECOME MORE- INFORMED

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:01.135
ESPECIALLY AS WE CLOSE THE DATA

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.536
GAPS THERE WILL BE MORE.

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.638
EVIDENCE THAT CAN HELP SUPPORT

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.640
SOME OF THE POLICY POSITIONS

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:10.611
THAT REALLY NEED TO BE MADE. IT

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.580
HERE THAT- YEAH AND I WAS JUST

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:14.615
GOING TO TOUCH POINT OF THIS

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:15.216
EVERYTHING PIECE JUST LOOKING

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:16.417
AT. THE STUDENT. IS THIS

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.486
THROUGH THE LENS OF CIVIL

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.621
RIGHTS IN RELEASING THAT- LIKE

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:21.222
I WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.790
THAT IS. LOT OF THE DISPARITIES

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:26.660
BETWEEN BARS A COLLAR AND THEIR

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:27.228
WHITE PEERS BUT ALSO WHEN WE

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:30.564
LOOK AT SERVICING WE SEE THAT.

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:32.433
ARGUE BARS A COLOR ARE YOU

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.034
ROLLING AND INCOME REPAYMENT.

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.668
OF THE SAME WEIGHT RATE AS-

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.971
WHITE FARMERS AND WE KNOW THAT.

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.873
BARS HAVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:40.508
WHEN THEY ARE ENROLLED IN-

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.543
INCOME RETURN PAYMENT PLANS AND

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.745
SO I WAS REALLY. LOOKING AT SIR

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.312
RESOURCES SAYING WHY ARE WE

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:46.580
HAVING THESE GAPS IF WE KNOW

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:50.518
THAT- BARS ARE MUCH. LESS

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:52.486
INCLINED TO DEFAULT LATEST

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:53.087
TWENTY TIMES LESS INCLINED TO

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.555
THE BALL WHEN. THEY'RE OLD ID

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.791
ARBOR WE'RE SEEING THAT- BAR

01:34:56.857 --> 01:35:00.561
WAS A COLOR NEARLY AS LIKELY TO

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:01.162
NOT BE MAKING PAYMENTS AS THEY

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.563
ARE TO BE INVOLVED IN IT ARE

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.765
PLANNED SO. REALLY MAKING THAT

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.534
PUSH TO MAKE ME DO TO BE

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.134
LOOKING AT SERVICERS AND IN.

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.736
EXAMINING THEIR PRACTICES IN

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.805
SAYING WHAT ARE WE HAVING THESE

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.973
GAPS IS. THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.679
ISSUE. CAN'T. WEAR MISSING IN.

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:22.416
PLACE TO PROTECT OUR. RIGHT

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.552
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. CAN

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:24.985
USE A COLOR HAVE A

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.387
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF DAT.

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:26.921
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:27.455
DEFAULT AND END UP AS A

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.055
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:28.789
STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN THESE

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.524
FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. AND WE

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:32.760
DID SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT IT

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.562
IN IT SEEMS THAT THAT HAS BEEN

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:36.564
A DELIBERATE TARGETING A

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.666
MARKETING STRATEGY. I'M ARE

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:42.470
THERE AND IT ALSO SEEMS AS IF

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:44.705
THERE ARE- HE SAID SOME

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.640
DISPARITIES IN SERVICING. CAN'T

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:50.377
ENTER QUINCY. ARE THERE ANY

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.011
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU THINK WE

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:51.579
NEED TO BE DOING FROM HIM IN

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:52.680
EDUCATION- COMMUNICATION

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:53.247
PERSPECTIVE TO TRY TO CLOSE

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:56.650
SOME OF THOSE GAPS. AT THE

01:35:56.717 --> 01:36:02.389
STATE LEVEL I THINK THAT. IN

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:02.957
ONE IS A TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.859
DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT ARE

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:06.460
THERE A BIG OFFICE OF STUDENT

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:06.994
ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF WAS

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.629
CREATED AT THE BUREAU FOR

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:10.764
PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.700
THEY HAVE IN THEIR SHORTS

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.835
TENURE THERE REALLY TRIED TO

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:18.539
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OUTREACH

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.106
THAT THEY ARE DOING THEY ARE

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:22.510
TRYING TO ATTEND COLLEGE FAIRS

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:24.545
AND- DO. MORE INFORMATION. FOR

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.580
MORE INFORMATION WITH AT

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:27.148
CRITICAL TIMES I THINK THAT

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:28.616
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I ALSO

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.551
I'LL I'LL REPEAT MYSELF I THINK

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.453
THAT AS WE GET MORE DATA IF

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.522
THAT WILL BE VALUABLE NOT ONLY

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:36.657
TO STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO- POLICY

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.425
MAKERS AS WE AS WE DESIGN

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:38.959
PROGRAMS THAT HELP GUIDE

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:42.496
STUDENTS AND SMALL GRANTS AND

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:43.164
HELPFUL INTO THEIR EDUCATIONS I

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.832
THINK HAVING DATA ON OUTCOMES

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.834
AND WHAT REALLY THAT RESULTS OF

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.536
THAT EDUCATION WILL BE WILL

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:52.339
REALLY HELP A LOT I THINK THAT.

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:54.675
BECAUSE LOS DATA GINGER GENERAL.

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.944
WAITING ON THAT BUT I DO THINK

01:36:57.011 --> 01:37:00.548
THAT IT IS IT IS A HUGE BENEFIT

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.416
TO BOTH STUDENTS AND POLICY

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.718
MAKERS- TO REALLY BE ABLE TO

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.487
ASSESS WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.522
THESE PROGRAMS ARE AND THEN TO

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:09.123
BE ABLE TO MAKE EDUCATED AND

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.457
INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:12.560
POLICIES WE WANT TO CREATE

01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:13.227
AROUND THEM SO THAT THAT IS ONE

01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:14.962
PIECE FOR ME. I REALLY LOVE IT

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.764
HE SAID ABOUT THE DATA VIEWS

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:18.699
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:19.333
THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL THAT WE

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.135
ALSO HAVE REALLY BELIEVE THAT

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.836
THE MORE THAT WE ACTUALLY THE

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:23.404
SEED WE CAN SEE THAT THIS

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:26.307
REALLY IS A CRISIS EIGHT I KNOW

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:26.941
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:28.676
RACIAL WEALTH GAP IN THIS

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.511
COUNTRY WE KNOW THAT- WHITE

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.813
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE THIRTEEN TIMES

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.582
THAT WEALTH OF BLACK ALSO IT'S

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.417
IN ABOUT 10% OF LATINO

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.419
HOUSEHOLDS AND SO WE CAN SEE

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:40.554
THAT THERE WAS GAPS WILL CREATE

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.723
THE ISSUES WHERE WE HAVE BARS

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.625
OF COLOUR TAKING OUT MORE THAN

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.961
THAT WE HAVE DATA ON SERVICING

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.395
OR THEY DON'T COME IN WITH

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:50.564
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:52.466
ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.568
IT WILL DISABLE- THESE ARE

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:58.772
DIFFERENT IS. IS YAKKING UP AS-

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:04.411
WE KNOW THAT. CALLING FOR. YEAH

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:06.447
THESE THINGS WERE STILL SAYING

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.047
ARE A GAP BETWEEN THE BARS SO

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:08.882
JUST REALLY RATING READER

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:10.451
REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:11.085
HAVING DATA TO REALLY PINPOINT

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.620
WHERE THESE PROBLEMS ARE COME

01:38:12.686 --> 01:38:14.388
BY ALSO I LOVE DATA AS WELL SO

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:14.922
AND IF YOU WERE IN A DATA

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.590
DRIVEN POLICY MAKING I'M BUT I

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:17.224
THINK THIS YET TO ME THAT YOU

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:17.858
YOU MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:18.792
IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A WEALTH

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.728
AND INCOME DISPARITY THERE THAT

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.696
IMPLIES THAT A LOT OF THESE

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:24.498
VIEWS OF COLOR QUALIFY FOR

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.667
LOANS QUALIFY FOR PROGRAMS THAT

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.535
THEY'RE EITHER NOT AWARE RATHER

01:38:28.602 --> 01:38:30.738
NOT APPLYING FOR. I'M IN ON THE

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.740
ONE HAND THIS FEELS LIKE A IN A

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.508
HUGE INTRACTABLE PROBLEM BUT

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.644
WHEN YOU DO THINK ABOUT THE

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.311
AMOUNT OF MONEY RELATING ON THE

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:38.545
TABLE BUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.547
IT COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE NOT

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.449
HAVING GOOD INFORMATION I'M FOR

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:44.818
PROFIT IN A DECISION TENDS TO

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.387
BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT

01:38:46.453 --> 01:38:46.920
MOST PEOPLE ARE MAKING A

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.555
DECISION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:50.324
THEY'RE GOING TO DO FOR COLLEGE

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:52.426
AT A POINT IN TIME THAT WE KNOW

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:54.628
WHERE IT IS SO IN TERMS OF FOR

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:55.262
US AS POLICY MAKERS BE ABLE TO

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:56.664
HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION.

01:38:56.730 --> 01:39:00.334
IT IS AN EASIER INTERVENTION

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:02.503
THAT IN SO MANY OF THE YOU KNOW

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.338
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GRAPPLE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:04.905
IT'S HAPPENING AT THE END OF

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.674
HIGH SCHOOL AND SHOULD BE ABLE

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.542
TO DO AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.444
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH EIGHT

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:12.413
EASY TO UNDERSTAND

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.481
COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION OF

HERE THEY ARE FINANCIAL AID

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:24.491
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:30.497
HERE'S THE- PERSON IF. I WEEK

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:34.468
BETTER. FOR LEASE AT. FACE I

NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT- IT IS

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:43.177
IT IS MORE COMMON THAT YOU ARE

GOING TO HAVE A RETURNING

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:44.878
STUDENT A FIRST TIME COLLEGE

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:45.479
STUDENT THAT TOOK A FEW YEARS

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:46.547
BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:48.549
SINGLE PARENTS- FOSTER THAT

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:50.584
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. FOR PROFITS

FOLKS THAT HAVE THE LEAST

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:56.323
AMOUNT OF SORT OF SUPPORT-

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.659
UNFORTUNATELY AND SO- AT LEAST

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:02.596
THE BAD ACTORS TO AND SO. IT IS

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.498
THERE LIKE I SAY THERE ARE

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:06.500
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STATS

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:08.435
CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO DO

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:09.069
STUFF BUT THE SORRY THE OFFICES

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.637
STUDENTS. RELIEF I'M REALLY HAS

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.506
DONE A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:13.140
REACH STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:16.477
THEY'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH-

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:17.010
TRYING TO DO SOME WORK ON

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:18.746
MILITARY BASES WHICH IS ANOTHER

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.547
BIG SEGMENT VETERANS AND ACTIVE

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:24.351
MILITARY ARE OFTEN ALSO- ONE OF

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:24.985
THOSE TARGETED DEMOGRAPHICS. SO

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:26.887
TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REACH

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:29.022
THOSE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THE

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:30.424
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHERE

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:32.593
THEY ARE I THINK IS ALSO GOING

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:34.495
TO BE REALLY CRITICAL- AND

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.630
OFTEN TOUGHER BECAUSE AS YOU

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.565
SAY THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALL

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.434
WRAPPED UP. IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:04.890
MORE TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.926
ARE WORSE AND I THINK THAT

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.561
STARTS. WITH MORE EFFECTIVE

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:10.563
CONSUMER PROTECTION ODD. ODD

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:12.498
LEGISLATION AND OVERSIGHT WE

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:14.500
TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT EIGHTY

02:01:14.567 --> 02:01:15.101
THREE SEVENTY SIX IS BEING. A

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:16.902
REALLY CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.771
THAT JOURNEY- AND IT CERTAINLY

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:22.541

THING THAT I TAKE AWAY FROM

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:28.648

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:30.716
WE MADE IN THE FIRST PANEL THAT

02:01:30.783 --> 02:01:32.485
WE ARE LEADING A LOT OF MONEY.

02:01:32.551 --> 02:01:34.353
ON THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.822
THERE IS. A LOT THAT WE CAN DO

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.357
IS CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:38.958

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:00.846

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:01.447
PACE OF INFLATION AND A PIECE

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:02.615
OF COST OF LIVING HERE IN

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:04.550
CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE GOT TO

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:06.686
