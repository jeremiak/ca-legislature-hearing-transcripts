AND WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM.

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.195
THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS OF

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.064
THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CASEY

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:07.631
JENNINGS.

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.466
I'M THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.201
NOT FOR PROFIT THIRTEENTH AVENUE

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:12.536
FUNDING.

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.438
WE STARTED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:14.938
TO FOCUS ON INCOME SHARE

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.507
AGREEMENTS.

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.375
WE WERE ADVISERS TO PRODUCE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.376
UNIVERSITIES PROGRAM.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.711
WITH ADVISED A COUPLE OTHER

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.112
PROGRAMS.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.514
WE'VE TALKED TO INVESTORS WE'VE

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.882
TALKED TO COLLEGES WE TALK TO

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.250
TEACHERS WE TALKED TO A LOT OF

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.152
STUDENTS.

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:30.087
PRIOR TO THIS WORK I SPENT

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.188
THIRTY YEARS BASICALLY ON WALL

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.356
STREET CREATING STRUCTURED

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:35.659
FINANCE PRODUCTS.

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.427
I GOT INVOLVED IN AYE ESSAYS

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.663
BECAUSE I NOTICES STUDENTS WERE

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.164
BORROWING MORE.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.331
MUCH MORE.

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:42.366
BUT THE OUTCOMES WERE NOT

00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:43.700
GETTING BETTER.

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:44.868
AND THE RISK OF THAT INCREASED

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.570
BORROWING WAS BEING BORNE BY THE

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.872
STUDENTS.

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.140
IN MY FORMER CAREER HAVING THE

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.875
WEAKEST PARTY IN A TRANSACTION

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.610
BEAR ALL THE RISK WAS ALWAYS THE

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.812
WRONG DEAL.

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.948
THOSE DEALS BLOW UP THEIR HARM

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.917
EVERYBODY INVOLVED WITH THEM.

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.418
THAT'S OUR STUDENT LOAN SYSTEM

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.353
IS IS WHAT IS HEADING.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:03.954
FOR IT'S PRETTY FAR DOWN THAT

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:06.957
ROAD.%

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.859
THE ISSUE A STERN DOES A CURLY

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:09.726
STRUCTURED IS THAT DEBT BEING

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.061
BORNE BY THE WEAKEST PARTY THE

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.664
STUDENTS THE FALL RATES RISE

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.032
STUDENTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PAY.

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.800
AND THE TAXPAYERS GONNA WRITE

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:17.868
THE CHECK.

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:20.337
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:22.973
I ESSAYS OFFER THE POTENTIAL. TO

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.341
MOVE SOME OF THAT ROSE FROM THE

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.009
STUDENTS TO A PARTY BETTER ABLE

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:28.212
TO BEAR THAT RISK.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:28.779
BUT I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND I

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:31.014
SAID POTENTIAL.

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.516
THERE ARE GOOD I SAY IS THERE

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.451
ARE ABOUT.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:35.419
SIX I WANT TO TURN TO THE LETTER

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.587
FROM THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.055
ASSOCIATION.

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.357
SOME OF THE DETAILS CONCERNING

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.259
IOS IS NOT LETTER INCORRECT.

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:44.127
I DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT.

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:45.796
I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ON SAID

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.564
ASSUMPTION LETTER.

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.131
THE LETTER ASSUMES THAT AYE

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:50.601
ESSAYS ARE NOT ALREADY AVAILABLE.

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.102
IN CURRENTLY BEING USED BY CSU

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.037
STUDENTS.

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.906
BUT THEY ARE BEING USED.

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.007
THAT SCALE.

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.675
MY CURRENT STUDENTS BY RECENT

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.310
GRADUATES AND BY POTENTIAL

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:02.379
STUDENTS. FOR WHOM GOING TO

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.547
COLLEGE PROPOSES TO MUCH

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:06.450
FINANCIAL RISK.

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.018
SO WHERE THEY USING THOSE MOST

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:08.619
IN ARE USING AN PURSUE

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:10.787
CERTIFICATES FROM PROGRAMMING

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.189
BOOT CAMPS.

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.557
I'M SURE USING THE ADS ABOUT

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.526
HALF OF ALL THE PROGRAMMING BOOT

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:17.027
CAMPS THE I'D STATES IN

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.095
CALIFORNIA.

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:18.895
A GOOD PORTION OF THOSE BOOT

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.831
CAMPS ARE FUNDED BY THE STUDENTS

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.733
SIGNING ISA'S.

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.668
THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.337
REGULATION THERE'S NO OFFERING

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:27.638
[inaudible]

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.373
IN FACT.

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:31.608
UC SAN DIEGO'S EXTENSION PROGRAM

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.310
IS ENTERED A JOINT VENTURE WITH

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.611
A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GROUP IN

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:35.779
SAN DIEGO.

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.281
IT'S GOING TO KICK OFF IN JULY

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:38.815
WITH ITS FIRST CLASS AND THE

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:41.051
STUDENTS HAVE THE OPTION OF

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:41.585
SIGNING INTO INCOME SHARE

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.253
AGREEMENTS.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.489
SO BETWEEN THE BOOT CAMPS.

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:47.691
THE UC EXTENSION AND ALL THE

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.393
PROGRAMS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.028
THESE ARE ALREADY OUT THERE SO I

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:53.363
RESPECT THE FACT RECESS ASIAN.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.998
BUT HAVING SEE IF YOU SAY WE'RE

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.433
NOT GOING TO DO IT.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.034
I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY SOLVES

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.802
THE PROBLEM [inaudible]

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:01.138
SO.

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:02.506
I THINK THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:03.807
TRANSFER RISK.

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:04.841
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S UNCLEAR

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.643
THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:07.811
THE REASON WHY ORGANIZATION

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.179
SUPPORTS THIS BILL.

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.914
IS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S MUCH

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:13.650
BETTER HAVE CSU AND UC SPONSOR

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.052
AYE ESSAYS THAN THE CURRENT

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:18.155
FRAME.

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.723
WE THINK THERE HAVE GOOD FOR THE

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:20.991
HAVE IMPROVED DISCLOSURE

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:21.558
INCREASED CHANCE PARENTING

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.226
BETTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.161
THE STUDENT. FOR AMOUNT OF

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:25.562
OVERSIGHT PROBABLY A LOT OF

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.963
DISCUSSION.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.999
NONE OF THAT'S CURRENTLY

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:29.566
HAPPENING WITH AYE ESSAYS IN

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.034
CALIFORNIA.

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:32.336
A WELL STRUCTURED I ESSAY WILL

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:32.936
TRANSFER THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:33.870
RISK.

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.405
FROM THE POOL OF STUDENTS TO

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:37.341
THIRD PARTIES.

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.309
HAVING THIS LEGISLATURE FUND A

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.711
PILOT PROGRAM WE HAVE THE

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.846
OPPORTUNITY OFFERED A BETTER I

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.014
SAY TO CALIFORNIANS.

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.449
HAND SINCE I'M FROM THE PRIVATE

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.718
SECTOR --

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.019
FOR THIRTY STAND OF THE OTHER

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:49.653
PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO UP THEIR

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.420
GAME.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.421
BECAUSE THIS WILL BECOME THE

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.590
BENCHMARK PRODUCT THIS WEEK ON

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.192
WHAT STUDENTS WILL LOOK AT AND

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.493
THEY'LL HAVE SOME TRANSFERRED TO

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.729
FIGURE OUT WHAT A GOOD I SAY IS

00:49:58.795 --> 00:49:59.896
FROM A BAD I SAY.

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.198
SO.

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.332
IF WE DO NOTHING.

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.167
CRITICIZED THE EXISTING SYSTEM

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.635
IS JUST FINE.

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:06.837
THEN WE WON'T HAVE THAT WON'T

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:07.771
HAPPEN.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:08.372
AND THE STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.373
TO BEAR RISK.

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:12.676
AND WE WON'T SEE.

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.511
THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY THANKS

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:15.779
FOR YOUR TIME I'LL STOP AND TAKE

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.047
QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.582
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I'D

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:21.551
LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.720
ACCEPTS THE AMENDMENTS.

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:26.623
AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.258
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU --

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:34.831
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:50.480
THREE NINE ANY WITNESSES AGAINST.

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:51.548
MR MEMBERS ANDREW ANTS WE HERE

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.016
TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.018
CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION --

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:55.986
WE'VE BEEN ON RECORD WITH OUR

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:58.889
OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL --

00:50:58.955 --> 00:50:59.856
WHERE TO STAND THE GOOD

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.691
INTENTIONS AND FRANKLY THANK THE

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.059
COMMITTEE FOR REFINING THE BILL?

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:04.761
BUT THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.363
HAVING PRIVATE INVESTORS PROVIDE

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.031
THIS TYPE OF FINANCIAL AID IT'S

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.800
NOT A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.268
PUBLICLY FUNDED FINANCIALLY.

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.703
AND IT COULD BE A PATHWAY

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.506
TOWARDS WAY SO HERE IS

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.375
QUESTIONABLE.

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:19.843
AND WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE OF

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.977
STUDENTS ARE DESPERATE TO GET A

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:23.213
HIGHER EDUCATION WE REALLY

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:23.980
BELIEVE OF THE AUTHOR IN A

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.182
SPONSOR --

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.383
HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS HERE BUT WE

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.485
THINK THAT EVEN WITH THE

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:29.152
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEES

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:29.853
MADE.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.055
OF THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS TO

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:33.890
PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID.

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.392
AND WE'D RATHER SEE A STUDENT

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.693
GOING DOWN THAT PATHWAY.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.395
THEN.

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:39.963
MAKE THEMSELVES YOU KNOW

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.932
AVAILABLE TO THIS KIND OF A

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:44.201
SITUATION WHERE THEIR FUTURE

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.102
INCOME AFTER THEY LEAVE FROM THE

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.537
UNIVERSITY NOT NECESSARILY

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.573
GRADUATE --

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:51.174
HAVE THEIR WAY JUST GARDENERS.

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.009
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.478
CONTINUE TO RETAIN OPPOSITION

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.012
NOT WITHSTANDING THE AMENDMENTS

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:57.581

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:22.859
THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER SOURCE

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.727
FOR MONEY PRODUCER TO REPLACE

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.896
THE PARENT PLUS LOANS IN THE

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:29.565
PRIVATE LOANS FOR STUDENTS THAT

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:30.700
BLOW THROUGH THAT LIMóN.

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.335
SO THAT WAS THE IDEA PRODUCE.

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.037
TARGETED RETURN.

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:34.771
YOU COULD HAVE TO THINK OF

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:35.905
THERE'S LEVERAGE HERE YOU CAN

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.674
PLAY WITH THE STRUCTURE PRODUCED

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.474
TARGETED RETURN FOR THE WHOLE

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:41.277
POOL IS 9% BEFORE WRITE OFFS IN

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:42.812
ABOUT SEVEN POINT SIX AFTER

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:43.947
WRITE OFFS.

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.581
SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:47.784
BIGGEST SYSTEM SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:48.384
LOOKED AT THIS AND ARE LOOKING

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.452
AT THIS.

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:50.853
THERE IS A BUNCH OF SMALL

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.754
UNIVERSITIES OUT THERE WE'VE

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.523
SPOKEN TO THEM.

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:55.091
THE CITY UNIVERSITY SYSTEM NEW

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:56.759
YORK IS LOOKING AT THE STILL THE

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:57.827
BILL AGAIN FOR AWHILE.

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.996
THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.932
NEW YORK IS LOOKING AT THEM --

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.534
THE TEXAS COMMON FUNDERS LOOKING

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.069
TO INVEST.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.570
THE TEXAS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.671
LOOKING UP.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.306
AND THERE'S PROBABLY A BUNCH OF

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:11.741
OTHER CONVERSATIONS GOING ON

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:12.875
THEY TEND TO POP UP AND GO DOWN.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:14.811
I'LL ALSO TELL YOU EXPLICITLY.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:17.213
LOTS OF UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS LIKE

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:17.814
THE IDEA AS LONG AS THEY DON'T

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.016
HAVE TO FUND. TO THE PEARLY

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.384
HAVING SOMEONE ELSE FUNDS THAT.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:21.985
BUT THERE DEVELOPMENT OFFICER

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.453
ISRAEL'S IS NOT INTERESTED IN

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.554
WRITING THE CHECK BECAUSE THEY

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:24.988
WANT.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:26.556
TO WRITE CHECKS FOR OTHER THINGS

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.325
WE GET THAT PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.027
PRETTY RISKY WAS FUNDED

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.362
INITIALLY BY THE ENDOWMENT.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.430
AND THEN THE EXISTENTIALLY SOLD

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:37.633
DOWN SOME OF THEIR POSITION TO

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.668
TO CHARITIES BASED IN INDIA.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.537
I'M NOT AWARE.

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:44.474
THE PRODUCES A TAKEN ANY.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.943
I JUST ACTUALLY.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.443
I'M NOT A NON DISCLOSURE

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.911
AGREEMENT.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:49.879
HE WAS TAKING MONEY FROM TO

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.080
CORPORATIONS IN INDIANA THAT ARE

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.348
INTERESTED IN PARTICULAR CITY

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.683
AND THEY FUNDED AN EXPECTED RATE

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.517
OF RETURN.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:58.654
IN SORT OF THE MID SINGLE DIGITS.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:00:59.622
I GOT ALL I CAN SAY HERE TODAY.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.958
ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.493
TERMS OF FUNDING AYE ESSAYS HAS

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.427
TYPICALLY FUNDED THEM OUT OF THE

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:04.827
MIX.

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.829
OF CHERNOBYL GRANTS AND LORENA

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.332
RETURNS THIS IS FOR PUBLIC

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.234
UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. FOR PRIVATE

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.469
BOOT CAMPS FOR PROGRAMMING SORT

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.305
OF PROGRAMS.

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:17.040
THOSE RETURNS ARE TYPICALLY

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:20.143
LOOKED IN THE MID TO HIGH TEENS

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.778
NOT SORT OF ONE OF OUR ISSUES.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.980
IS INVESTORS ARE LOOKING TO MAKE

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.882
14% PLUS. NINE WE THINK THAT'S

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.216
AN ISSUE THAT PROBABLY FEEL HE

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.051
GRAPPLE WITH THAT --

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:28.818
BUT ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.253
UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AND FOR THE

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.988
PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN AROUND

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:32.889
A LONG TIME THEY'RE NOT FOR

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.223
PROFIT.

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.092
WE SEE TYPICALLY SEEN TARGET

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.227
AREAS TO RETURN FOR SIX OR 7%.

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:39.128
SO.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:39.996
YES THERE'S NO INTEREST BUT BY

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.731
MOVING THOSE LEVERS ABOUT

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:42.932
EXPECTED INCOME WHAT'S THE

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.600
DURATION OF THE CONTRACT WHAT'S

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.036
THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME YOU CAN

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.771
TARGET DIFFERENT RATES OF RETURN.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:49.806
QUESTION.

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.441
IF I BUY INVESTED IN A STUDENTS

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.842
SPECIFICALLY AS OPPOSED TO A

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.211
POOL WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHAT

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.446
HAPPENS AND THAT STUDENT.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.847
DROPPED OUT.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.048
IF THEIR INCOME NEVER EXCEEDS

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.183
THE THRESHOLD YOU'RE GONNA MAKE

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.251
NOTHING.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.086
IF THEY'RE EXCEEDING THREE

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:03.686
INCOME EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD A

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:04.554
LITTLE BIT.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.456
YOU MAY MAKE A LITTLE BIT ARE

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.757
YOU GONNA GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.025
DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ASSUMPTION

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.327
WAS THE LIKELY NOT.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.895
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.097
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.832
SHIFT RISK FROM STUDENTS.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.400
WHO MAY NOT STAND THERE MAJOR

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.469
WHO MAY NOT GET EMPLOYED WHOM

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.037
MAY HAVE TO GO HOME AND TAKE

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.171
CARE OF A PARENT?

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.107
WHO MAY HAVE TO MOVE BACK TO FOR

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:24.774
THE COUNTRY WITH THE INCOME IS

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.375
IN HIGH IS TO HAVE THAT RICHARD

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.877
REID RETURN THOSE PAYMENTS

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.712
AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST?

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.280
HAS THEIR INCOME ADJUST AND IF

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.748
THEY'RE OUT OF WORK.

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:34.283
IT TURNS OFF.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.318
UNLIKE.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:36.919
THE FEDERAL ID OUR PROGRAM WHICH

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.521
IS A NICE IDEA BUT HORRIBLY

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.923
MISTREATED UNLIKE PRIVATE LOANS

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.692
UNLIKE PARENT PLUS.

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:43.292
I DON'T THINK IT'S A PERFECT

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.228
SOLUTION I JUST THINK IT CAN BE

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:47.296
CAN BE BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.197
ONES OUT THERE.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.600
EDIT YOUR QUESTION.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:53.903
YEP BUT THE IF.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.138
THE HOW HOW LONG IT --

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.206
DID A DID TO PUT BUT TO BEGIN

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:00.476
THIS PROGRAM. FOUR YEARS AGO

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.711
FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS AGO.

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.012
SO THERE AND THEY STARTED WITH

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.848
SENIORS WHO GRADUATED MIDDLE FOR

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.884
YEARS SO WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.752
GRADUATES WELL SO THE

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.053
INTERESTING PART IS.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.522
A FAIR NUMBER PRODUCES INITIAL

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.891
GROUP WENT ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.392
SO THE AGREEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.427
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION WHICH OF

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.729
ONE OF OUR AMENDMENTS.

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:20.263
WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE IN

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.497
GRADUATE SCHOOL?

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:22.665
AND THEN IT STARTS ONCE THEY GET

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.934
WHICH ARE NO LONGER IN FULL TIME

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:25.468
SCHOOL.

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.837
WHICH THE FEDERAL ONE DOES THE

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.772
PRIVATE LOANS ARE LESS CONTROL

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:30.373
THAT WAY.

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:31.507
IT'S SORT OF EMBEDS A BUNCH OF

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.642
FLEXIBILITY.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:35.444
CELL AND PRETTY COLORS SEVEN

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.646
SAID.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:37.847
SO HOW IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.215
OUR RETURN I SAID THE FACT THE

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.416
GREATER AND SO MUCH MORE AFTER

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:41.651
THEY GET THEIR GRADUATE DEGREE.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.618
YOU'LL PROBABLY DO BETTER SO IT

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:44.153
WOULD BE ON A BIT TOO EARLY TO

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.322
SEE THE WHETHER IT AND THERE'S

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.891
NO NEED A DATE OF WERE AVAILABLE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.226
AND AND PRODUCED PROGRAM.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:50.826
IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE STEM

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:51.327
FIELDS OF YOUR COMPUTER

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:51.894
PROGRAMMING MAJOR JUST FOR

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.729
EXAMPLE PRODUCE.

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.797
THE OBLIGATION EXTENDS FOR

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.399
EIGHTY FOUR MONTHS.

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.867
AND IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE IF

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.202
YOU'RE IN THEIR LOWEST EARNING

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.570
MAJOR JUST FORESTRY.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.904
IT'S A HUNDRED FOURTEEN MONTHS

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.307
AND IT'S PLEASE LIKE SEVEN POINT

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.008
6%.

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.310
WE ADVISE FOR YOU NOT TO DO THAT

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:08.844
WE SAID ONE DOES HAVE ONE

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:11.080
PROGRAM FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:12.381
AND THIS GUY NAY MITCH DANIELS

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.717
SAID NOW OUR TRYING TO SEND A

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:15.318
STRONGER SIGNAL ABOUT WHAT YOU

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:16.352
TO MAJOR IN.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.954
WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THAT THERE'S

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:23.960
LOTS OF WAYS TO DO IT --

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.095
MR GABRIEL THANK YOU THINK THINK

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:26.862

AUTHOR FOR ME FOR THIS MEASURE I

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.199
THINK IT'S ALWAYS WORTH.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.033
THINKING ABOUT NEW --

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.535
STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATION FINANCE

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.936
AND OPENING UP THE DOORS OF OF

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.037
COLLEGE MORE FOLKS.

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.606
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ABOUT

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:37.640
THIS -- IN

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.109
IN MAYBE NOT TRADE UNDERSTAND IT

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.577
I THINK WITH A LOT OF THESE

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:42.111
THINGS THE DEVIL'S IN THE

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.012
DETAILS HERE.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.480
I'M SORRY THESE PERCENTAGES

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.681
CALCULATORS ICING THERE SOME

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.216
FINANCIAL MODELING ACTUARIES ARE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.784
INVOLVED IN SO I GUESS MY

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:49.952
QUESTIONS THERE ARE.

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.687
IF THAT MODELING IS OFFICE WE'VE

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.122
SEEN YOU KNOW FOLKS INSTRUCTION

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.590
FINANCE CAN BE AWFULLY SO THAT A

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.692
LITTLE BIT DURING THE THE LAST --

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:58.527
GREAT RECESSION --

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.595
IS THE TAXPAYER ON THE HOOK FOR

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.763
THAT OR THE UNIVERSITY AND THE

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:01.464
SECOND QUESTION IS THIS GOING TO

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.398
CREATE.

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.033
INCENTIVES FOR UNIVERSITIES TO

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.134
STEER STUDENTS INTO CERTAIN

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.602
PROFESSIONS MAYBE AWAY WILL AWAY

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.603
FROM THINGS LIKE THE PEACE CORPS

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.604
IN TOWARDS THINGS LIKE

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.106
INVESTMENT BANKING SO.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.141
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.909
THINGS THAT CAME TO MIND FOR ME.

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:18.180
SOBERING TRY TO UNDO THE REVERSE

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.482
ORDER TO THE FROM MY BRAIN WORKS.

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:21.083

THE I. SA IS TIED INCOME IF

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:26.422
THEY'RE NOT MAKING INCOME

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.891
THERE'S ACTUALLY BURNING OFF

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:29.425
YEARS OBLIGATION.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.594
DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONTRACTS

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.596

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:34.563
PURDUE'S CONCERNS ON THE IN

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.032

FOREGO WORK IN RELIGIOUS

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.537
PROGRAMS AND THAT ACTUALLY WENT

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.606
UP SO ACTUALLY GETS BETTER

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.374
FLEXIBILITY FOR DOING.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.476
PUBLIC WORK WE IT GETS BETTER

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.779
FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

GETTING AM DES WHO WANT TO GO

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.982
WORK IN.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.383
THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IT MEDIA LEE

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.920
CLICK ST AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO

ACCRUING COME BACK.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.492
IT BURNS OFTEN PRODUCE ACHES THE

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:04.527
HIT.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:05.161
THE TAXPAYERS ARE ON THE HOOK

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.963
THE MINI SHOWS UP DAY ONE FROM

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.998
THE FUNDING SOURCE THE ENDOWMENT

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.566
THE FIVE ONE TWO THREES OR THE

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.901
CORPORATIONS THAT ARE WILLING TO

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:12.468
EMBARK.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.103
ON THAT PROGRAM SO TAXPAYERS

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.604
NEVER ON THE HOOK FOR THAT SORT

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:18.341
OF THING WHICH IS TO BE A HUGE

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.309
FEATURE --

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:20.976
WAS THE OTHER QUESTION I MEAN I

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:21.644
I GUESS JUST ON THE PART ABOUT

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:23.079
THE TAX FOR NEVER BEING ON THE

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:23.646
HOOK ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.147
DOING THIS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.449
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:27.149
SO.

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.918
IF IF THE FINANCIAL MODELING IS

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:30.886
OFF AND THE IN DOWNEY THE

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.088
UNIVERSITY ENDS UP TAKING AHEAD

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.422
I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE TO THE

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.358
DETRIMENT OF THE PUBLIC AND IF

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.525
FOR WORKING WITH A CORPORATION

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:37.827
IT ASSUMES THAT THAT CORPORATION

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:38.994
THAT'S WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.930
ADEQUATELY FUNDED BY FLETCHER

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:41.197
SAY THAT.

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.765
THE BECAUSE THE MONEY SHOWS UP

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.734
DAY.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.502
ONE SO IF SO AS LONG AS THE

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.737
CHECK SHOWS UP YOUR FREEDOM CARE

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:48.838
ABOUT THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.206
THE PEOPLE GAVE YOU THE CHECK

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:51.574
BECAUSE YOU GOT THE CHECK.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.275
AND YOU PAY THE TUITION TO THE

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.277
UC OR CSU.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.079
SO SO THAT KIDS THE CREDIT

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:57.580
BURDEN.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:59.548
ONCE YOU CASH THE CHECK YOU'RE

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:00.316
NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEIR CREDIT

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:02.084
WORTHINESS TO THE EXTENT THAT IS

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.254
FROM THE ENDOWMENT OF YOU SEE OR

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.590
CSU YEAH YOUR BUT THE WEIRD PART

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.991
ABOUT AYE ESSAYS.

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.527
MUCH MORE THAN DEBT.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:12.361
WHICH IS SORT OF THIS IS THAT

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.296
BOBBY REPROOF IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.831
WHAT A DEBT CONTRACT LOOKS LIKE.

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.200
YOUR BEST TODAY WITH A DEAD

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.769
INVESTORS THE DAY YOU BOOK IT.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.237
AND THEN WITH YOUR BUNCH OF

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.705
PEOPLE THAT DO YOU LONG TO

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.774
MONITOR THINGS DON'T PERFORM IT

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.509
SLOWLY GOES SOUTH.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:29.078
WITH AN AYE A SAY YEAH YOU HAVE

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.045
SOME THE GO SOUTH.

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.981
AND USE ON THE GO NORTH.

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:34.250
AND SO THE VARIANCE ON A BIG

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.451
POOL OF I SAY CONTRACTS LIKE IF

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.353
WE GET EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.020
IT DOESN'T MOVE MUCH AT ALL EVEN

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.789
IN THE GREAT RECESSION WE WENT

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.357
THROUGH LOOKING AT LOW INCOME

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.458
LOW WELL STUDENTS.

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.427
HISPANICS TWENTY FIVE YOU KNOW

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:45.728

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.363
THEIR TOTAL INCOME OF THAT LOW

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.432
INCOME GROUP IN THE GREAT

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.667
RECESSION DROP 6% FOR TWO YEARS

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.002
AND THEN CAME BACK.

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.036
IT IS BACK TO WHERE WE EXPECTED.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:57.506
YOU KNOW SO THE RISK WITH A FULL

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:00.443
RSA'S IS MUCH BETTER THAN WITH A

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.044
FULL OF LOOKS.

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:03.212
AND THE POINT IS STUDENTS TO

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.847

THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE THAT BET

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:09.518
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA MAKE A

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:10.686
TON OF MONEY.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.321

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.989
REALIZE SAY THEY'RE FINE.

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.791

GENERATION.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.730
THEY GET WHAT FINANCIAL RISK YES

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:22.798

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.155
A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF HOME.

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.289
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW I GOT

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.590
THESE LOANS --

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.592
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I LEFT MY

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:48.063
HOUSE?

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:48.663
DUE TO ABUSE --

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:50.699
I WAS REALLY GIVEN THE CHOICE OF

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:53.768
STREETS OR SCHOOL HOME AND

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:54.936
SCHOOL WITH MY SAFE ZONE SO

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.972
THAT'S WHERE I WENT AND I STAYED --

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.809
I LOVE SCHOOL AND BUT MY PARENTS

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.711
MADE TOO MUCH MONEY.

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.012
THEY WEREN'T PAYING FOR MY

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:04.946
SCHOOL OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY WERE

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.915
TARA THAT BUT THEY MADE TOO MUCH

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.583
MONEY SO I DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:08.783

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.155
THAT.

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:15.623
SO MY ONLY OPTION REALLY TO GET

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.326
THROUGH SCHOOL WAS STUDENT LOANS --

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:21.329

THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IS REALLY

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:25.246
QUITE TRAGIC AND AND OBVIOUSLY

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:25.846
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:26.914
THAT THAT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.315
THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:29.650
TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE NOT.

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:32.186

COLLEGES.

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:41.929
I WORK WITH A LOT OF PART TIME

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.430
FACULTY AT YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:44.765
PROBABLY THIRTY OF THE FORTY

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.066
YEARS I WAS A CYNICAL STATE.

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.368
AND I KNOW THAT I WORK WITH SOME

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.403
AMAZING PART TIME FACULTY WHO

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:50.771
GAVE LOTS OF TIME.

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.439
AND AND MUCH NEEDED TIME TO OUR

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.708
STUDENTS AND GRADING PAPERS AND

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.510
AND COUNSELING THEM ON THE SIDE

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:57.978
AND HELPING THEM STAY IN SCHOOL

01:36:58.045 --> 01:36:59.180
AND AT THE SAME TIME RUNNING ALL

01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:00.814
OVER THE CITY TO TEACH CLASSES

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:01.682
TO TRY TO MAINTAIN A LIFE

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.017
THEMSELVES.

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:05.085
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PART

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:07.788
TIME FACULTY THAT TIME FACULTY

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:10.191
AS THEIR ONLY LIFE OF THE THEIR

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:11.025
WEALTH ONLY MONEY THEY WERE

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:11.659
MAKING.

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:13.194
WHO ACTUALLY PROSPERED FROM THAT

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.495
EXPERIENCE OTHER THAN IN THE

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:16.530
EMOTIONAL SENSE OF BEING ABLE TO

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:17.865
GET BACK SOMETHING THAT THEY SO

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:19.133
STRONGLY BELIEVE THEM?

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.201
BUT THEY OFTEN SUFFERED

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.769
FINANCIALLY THEY SUFFERED IN

01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:23.404
TERMS OF LOANS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.272
PAY THEY SUFFERED AND NOT BEING

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:26.607
ABLE TO LIVE THE LIFESTYLE THAT

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.242
THEY WANTED BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:29.610
INCOME WAS SO LOW.

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:30.711
BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.279
ARE THAT ENCOMPASSED IN IT AND

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.081
IT REALLY IS A SYSTEM THAT WE

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:35.683
HAVE TO AS AS A STATE LOOK AT

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:37.084
VERY CAREFULLY.

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.452
AND MAKE SURE THAT WOULD NOT

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.087
ONCE A CONTRIBUTING TO THE

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:40.921
POVERTY.

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:42.756
OF CALIFORNIA AND CONTRIBUTING

01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:43.757
TO THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WE

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.492
CLAIM WE FIGHT EVERY DAY AND

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:46.493
FOLKS WHO HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.861
AND THAT MEANS DEGREES AND WORK

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:48.462
HARD.

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:49.697
AND STILL A STRUGGLING THAT'S

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.899
NOT THE VISION YOU HAD I'M SURE

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.901
FOR YOUR LIFE AND FOR YOURSELF --

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.369
SO I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.770
THIS COMING FORWARD I I KNOW

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.372
THERE IS JUSTIFICATION FOR IT

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.708
BECAUSE NO FACULTY TEACHES MORE

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:01.408
THAN --

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:02.810
WHO'S A FULL TIME TENURE TRACK

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:04.645
FACULTY MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.647
WEEK MOST OF US TEACH NINE I

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:09.149
TAUGHT THREE SOMETIMES AND SIX

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.684
DEPENDING ON THE OTHER THING IS

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:12.319
THAT I WAS CONSIDERED FULL TIME.

01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:14.388
AND ARE AND SOLD MOST OF THE

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.056
TIME IF WE REALLY.

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.125
WOULD WE FORMULATED CORRECTLY --

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.393
IT IS THREE TO FOUR HOURS OR

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.762
MORE PER HOUR THAT YOU TEACH IN

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:22.596
DEALING WITH MEETING WITH

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:23.897
STUDENTS GRADING PAPERS

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.766
PREPARING FOR CLASSES AND DOING

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.334
YOUR RESEARCH BECAUSE YOU ARE

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:28.869
ALSO REACH EXPECTED INDIVIDUALS.

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:33.073
AND SELL PEOPLE SOMETIMES LOOK

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.377
AT PEOPLE HEY BECAUSE I'M ON A

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:41.849
LECTURE I MEAN SOMETHING AND SO

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.183
IT REALLY IS --

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.019
A UNFORTUNATE AND SAD FOR ME TO

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.620
KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO INDIVIDUAL

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:32.893
MANY CSU STUDENTS TO DRIVE TO

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:35.295
CAMPUS DO SO BECAUSE THEY MUST

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:36.363
THEY EITHER WORK ONE OR MORE

SERVED BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.206
PARKING ON CAMPUS IS THEIR ONLY

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.675
OPTION TO GET TO AND FROM SCHOOL.

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.143
WHAT WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.978
AN ACTIVE J. LACK AUDIT ON CSU

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:53.447
PARKING WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:54.848
AUDIT FINDINGS WILL COMPLEMENT

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.149

PAY MORE FOR PARKING AND STAFF

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.990
FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION ON

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.325
EVERY CAMPUS.

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.893
THESE PARKING RATES ARE DUE TO

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.228
TWO MAIN FACTORS THE BARGAINING

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:09.663
AGREEMENTS THAT STAFF AND

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:11.465
FACULTY SAT WITH THE CSU AND THE

01:46:11.531 --> 01:46:13.667
SELF SUPPORT REQUIREMENT OF THE

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:15.035
PARKING FACILITIES ON CAMPUS

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.104
WHICH MEANS NO OTHER FUNDS CAN

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:17.671
BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:18.605
BUDGETS.

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:20.173
WE UNDERSTAND HOW CRUCIAL IT IS

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.441
THAT OUR INSTITUTION HAS THE

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:22.476
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.277
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS

01:46:24.344 --> 01:46:25.946

AND YOU LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:30.684
ON PARKING RATES WE BELIEVE A

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:32.853
POSITIVE PRESSURE WILL BE PLACED

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:34.187
ON OUR ADMINISTRATION.

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.522
WHERE THEY CAN NO LONGER AGREE

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:36.857
TO SUCH AN UNFAIR AGREEMENT

01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:38.425
WHERE STUDENTS MUST PAY HIGHER

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:39.926
PARKING RATES TO SUBSIDIZE A

01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:42.462
FUNCTIONAL BENEFIT FOR FACULTY

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:43.130
AND STAFF?

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:44.297
WELL STUDENTS BELIEVE THAT WELL

01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:45.699
COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES ARE

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:48.101
CRITICAL TO OUR CAMPUS CULTURE

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.669

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:50.971
ISSUE HERE IS FAIRNESS.

01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:52.239
STUDENTS ARE THE ONLY GROUP OF

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:53.607
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PAID TO BE ON

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:54.708
CAMPUS.

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:56.143
RATHER THEY PAY TUITION AND FEES

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:57.611
TO BE THERE AND ARE THE LEAST

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:59.412
ABLE TO SHOULDER THESE UNFAIR

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:00.714
PARKING COSTS.

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:04.384
IT IS A CHALLENGING POLICY ISSUE

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:05.719

THE CSU SYSTEM WHICH IS A

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:10.884
MASSIVE STRUCTURE. 41% OF THE

THERE'S A LOT OF DISCREPANCIES.

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:23.864
AND STUDENTS DON'T GET PAID TO

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:24.197

OPENS UP THE FLAWS OF HOW WE WE

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:46.593
IS THE LEGISLATURE FORCED THE

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:51.331
CSU. TO FINANCE PARKING AND IRA

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.399
ARTHUR AGE PRE EARTHQUAKE WE HAD

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.801
A PARKING PROBLEM.

01:52:54.868 --> 01:52:55.735
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE WHEN THE

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:57.804
GARAGES COLLAPSED YOU KNOW WE

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.706
HAD A HUGE PARKING PROBLEM AND

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:01.107
NOW IS WE'VE.

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:04.277
STRUGGLED SO HARD AS HE CLIMBED%

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:06.212
OUT OF THE RECESSION TO OPEN UP

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:07.547
THE SEATS FOR STUDENTS FOR A

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:09.149
QUALIFIED TO GO TO A CSU THERE'S

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.817
AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM BECAUSE

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:12.118
WE GOT MORE STUDENTS ARE GOING

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:13.353
THANKFULLY BECAUSE THE BUDGET IS

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:14.821
GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GO

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:15.822
TO COLLEGE.

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:18.725
AND IT EXACERBATES THE PARKING

01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:20.226
DEMAND THAT WE HAVE AND THEN THE

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:22.095
NEED FOR MORE PARKING THAT NEEDS

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.329
TO BE MAINTAINED.

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:24.430
AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE MORE

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:25.865
STUDENTS THAN ANYONE ELSE AND SO

01:53:25.932 --> 01:53:27.233
WE FINANCE IT ON THE BACK OF

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.968
STUDENTS THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.370
IS REALLY FLAWED AND WE'RE GONNA

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:31.504
HAVE TO WORK WITH.

01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:33.573
THE FACULTY ON THIS IS HOW THEY

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.241
BARGAINED FOR A LOWER PRICE AND

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.676
THEY DO A GOOD JOB.

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:38.011
AT BARGAINING FOR A LOWER PRICE

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.812
BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE

01:53:39.879 --> 01:53:40.713
ELSE.

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:42.415
AND SO THERE IS A VALUE FOR A

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.250
PARKING SPOT THERE IS THE COST

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:45.752
OF MAINTAINING A PARKING SPOT

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:46.619
AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:48.354
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHEN WE ARE

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:49.455
WORKING WITH --

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:51.391
OUR EMPLOYEES ON TRYING TO

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:54.661
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE PRICE A

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.929
SPOT FOR AN EMPLOYEE.

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:56.963
NOW OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALL BE

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:58.698
EXTRAORDINARILY UPSET THAT

01:53:58.765 --> 01:53:59.299
STUDENTS ARE PAYING MORE THAN

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:00.667
ADMINISTRATORS.

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:02.435
AND THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE FLOCK --

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:05.405
RIGHT THERE --

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.839
SO YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW

01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:07.740

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:08.808
BILL -- I

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:09.409
DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL FIXES

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:11.978
THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE WE HAVE.

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:12.979
TO UNDO THE WAY THAT WE

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.948
BARGAINED FOR SPACES AND WE HAVE

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.449
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FINANCE

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:17.917
THE PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.219
WE SO BADLY NEED ESPECIALLY IF

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:20.286
YOU WANT.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.588
TO OPEN UP THE CAMPUSES TO EVEN

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.656

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:43.343
WE'RE DOING HERE --

01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:45.378
IS IMPORTANT BUT I I I THINK IT

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.446
NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:48.114
BALANCED APPROACH AND TAKE INTO

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:49.649
CONSIDERATION OUR CLIMATE --

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.784
GOALS OF WHEN WE SUBSIDIZE

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:54.020
PARKING WE ENCOURAGE DRIVING AND

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.255
I UNDERSTAND I TAKE YOUR POINT

01:54:55.321 --> 01:54:57.857
THAT FOR US SOME STUDENTS --

01:54:57.924 --> 01:54:59.959
THE COMMUTE --

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:02.228
THE A TRANSIT COMMUTERS

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:04.797
IMPOSSIBLE OR BICYCLE COMMUTE IS

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:06.833
ISN'T POSSIBLE --

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:09.902
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR A FORGET

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:10.770
IF WE'RE GONNA.

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:11.838
WE WE REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:16.175
AT NOT RACING TO THE BOTTOM FOR

01:55:16.242 --> 01:55:18.678
PARKING FEES --

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.947
I I THINK THE INEQUITY HERE IS

01:55:21.014 --> 01:55:22.315
THAT AND I YOU KNOW THE HOPE THE

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:24.484
FACULTY DOESN'T COME AFTER ME ON

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:25.652
THIS BUT WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:27.220
WE'RE WE'RE GIVING A BREAK TO

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:28.655
FACULTY WHERE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:30.156
BE GIVING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE WE

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.291
SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT.

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:32.925
HERE ON PARKING IT'S KIND OF

01:55:32.992 --> 01:55:34.794
ANTIQUATED THINKING THAT WE

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.429
SHOULD --

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.097
PROVIDE -- A

01:55:38.164 --> 01:55:39.799
BREAK TO ANY GROUP ON PARKING

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:40.867
WORK COSTS.

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:45.104
OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THE

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:47.240

OTHER OUR MAINTENANCE COSTS --

01:55:49.809 --> 01:55:52.345

01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:54.147
TELL ME IS --

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:56.082
THAT WERE ENCOURAGING MORE

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:57.250
PEOPLE TO DRIVE WHICH IS

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:59.185
COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO A LOT OF

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:01.020
THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE IN THE

01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:01.688
CAPITAL.

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:05.158

TO PROVIDE TRANSIT --

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:26.813
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.014
BE DOING --

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:29.082
AT LEAST AT THE COMMUNITY

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:31.551
COLLEGE LEVEL IS PROVIDING FREE

FOR AS MANY STUDENTS AND AND

01:56:38.358 --> 01:56:40.560

JUST PUTTING SOME IDEAS OUT

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.261

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:56.008
MEASURE.

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:57.310

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:03.182
JUST UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.283
OF THAT MISUNDERSTANDING A

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.485
LITTLE BIT OF THE REGULATORY

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:07.120
REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE HERE

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:09.922
RELATIVE. TO TO MISTER LEVINE --

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:10.923
AND I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.358
ANALYSIS IN ONE PLACE FOR TALKS

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:13.793
ABOUT FIND ANOTHER PLACE OR TALK

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.128
ABOUT FEES.

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.129
BUT I ALSO WORRY ABOUT

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:18.498
INADVERTENT CROSS SUBSIDIZATION

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:19.399

MAY BE DIFFERENT ON YOUR CAMPUS.

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.171
ACTUALLY MEAN THAT STUDENTS WHO

01:57:25.238 --> 01:57:26.639
AREN'T DRIVING ARE SUBSIDIZED

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:27.440
STUDENTS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.041
DRIVE AND THAT WOULD BE A

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.410
CONCERN OF MINE --

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:31.511

FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:33.179
WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.480
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.215
WE MAY ACTUALLY BE YOU KNOW THAT

COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE FROM THE

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.397
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT I WAS

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:52.365
JUST --

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.167
WOULD BE INTERESTED THE AUTHORS --

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:57.804
COMMENTS ON THAT.

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:58.805
WHAT YOU KNOW THE HOPE IN THIS?

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:00.273
THE ISSUE THAT'S COMING FORWARD

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.341
IS NOT ALWAYS JUST THAT THE

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:03.643
ACTUAL NUMBER THE COST BUT THE

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:04.977
UNFAIRNESS OF IT.

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:06.679
AND THE IF THERE IS A COST THAT

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.114
SHOULD BE BORN IN THE AREA OF

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.515
TRANCE IN PARKING IT SHOULD BE

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:11.050
SHARED GENERALLY ACROSS THE

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:12.518
BOARD -- AND

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:14.020
NOT NECESSARILY ONE BECAUSE

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:15.154
RIGHT NOW IT IS IS THAT THE

01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:16.589
STUDENTS OF SUBSIDIZING THE

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:18.291
FACULTY WHICH IS BACKWARDS IN

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:19.859
SOME WAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:20.593
STUDENTS HAVE A GROUP THAT

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.462
FACULTY SHOULD HAVE A GREATER

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:24.730
INCOME THAN THE STUDENTS AND THE

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:25.865
AND THE WAY IT IS NOW IT'S NOT

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:26.399
THAT.

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:27.733
I MAY END UP BEING ALL THE SAME

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.402
COST BUT JUST DISTRIBUTED

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:30.303
DIFFERENTLY --

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:31.938
SO BECAUSE THEIR CONCERN IS THAT

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.306
THIS IS UNFAIR NOT THAT THEY

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.507
SHOULD HAVE THREE PARKING OR

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:35.942
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHY

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:37.043
SHOULD A FACULTY.

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:39.111
A WHY SHOULD I PAY FOURTEEN

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:40.680
DOLLARS A WEEK A WHAT MONTH

01:58:40.746 --> 01:58:42.482
WHATEVER IT IS A SIXTY DOLLARS

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.115
FOR THE SEMESTER AND EVERYBODY

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:44.150
AND THEIR PAIN THREE HUNDRED AND

01:58:44.217 --> 01:58:45.685
SOMETHING YOU KNOW SO THAT IN

01:58:45.751 --> 01:58:47.086
ITSELF IS AN INEQUITY AND THAT'S

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:48.054
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.388
THE AN INEQUITY OF THE SYSTEM

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:50.990
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PAYING

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:52.091
MORE THAN FACULTY NOW HOW THEY

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.459
CHOOSE TO DIVVY IT UP BECAUSE

01:58:53.526 --> 01:58:54.894
RIGHT NOW THE FACULTY.

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:56.963
THEY'RE PAYING FOR BASICALLY THE

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:58.030
FACULTY TO PARK YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:58:58.097 --> 01:58:59.365
PAYING THE BURDEN OF THE FACULTY

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.000
WHICH IS NOT WHAT.

01:59:01.067 --> 01:59:05.071
SHOULD HAPPEN BUT FACULTIES ABLE

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:07.573
TO LOBBY AND I THINK THAT'S

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.041
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S THERE BUT

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.376
IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THAT IS

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:11.978
REALLY A MUCH MUCH MORE ABOUT

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.379
THAT PASSING IT ON TO THE OTHER

01:59:13.446 --> 01:59:14.113
STUDENTS WHO DON'T.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.149
DRIVE BUT IF IF THE DRIVERS IN

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:18.618
THE PARKERS ARE GOING TO PAY.

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:19.986
FOR A PARKING IT SHOULD BE

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.821
EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND NOT

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:23.589
DISPROPORTIONATELY DISTRIBUTED

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.423
TO STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:26.025
LOBBYISTS TO LOBBY FOR THEM AND

01:59:26.092 --> 01:59:27.927
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THEIR

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.929
ISSUE AND AND AND AND AND

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:30.796
WHETHER NOT --

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:32.331
THE OTHER ISSUE OF OF WHAT IT'S

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.566
NOT TO BE PASSED ON TO OTHER

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:35.167
STUDENTS HOPEFULLY THE CAMPUS

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:36.602
WON'T DO THAT --

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:37.970
ADDITIONALLY IN TERMS OF THE

01:59:38.037 --> 01:59:39.238
ENVIRONMENT THERE IT WOULD BE

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:40.206
GREAT IF THERE WAS PUBLIC

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.407
TRANSPORTATION.

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:42.775
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:43.976
NOT WANTING TO PAY MORE THAN

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:44.610
YOUR FAIR SHARE FOR PARKING IF

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:45.912
YOU CHOSE TO DRIVE.

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.713
BUT MANY CAMPUSES DON'T HAVE

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.749
ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:51.484
THAT'S A THAT'S CONSISTENT

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.252
THAT'S THAT'S THAT CAN GET THEM

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:55.154
TO AND FROM CAMPUS AS WELL AS IF

01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:56.222
THEY HAVE A PART TIME JOB ARE

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:57.623
THEY GOING TO GET HOME GET TO

01:59:57.690 --> 01:59:58.724
THE PART TIME JOB.

01:59:58.791 --> 02:00:00.393
THE THE REALITY IS OUR PUBLIC

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:02.161
TRANSIT SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.564
STATE IS NOT NECESSARILY PEOPLE

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:05.698
FRIENDLY.

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:07.300
AND UNFRIENDLY TOWARD PEOPLE WEB

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:09.368
LIVES THAT BASICALLY DEMAND THAT

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:11.971
THEY BE PLACES QUICKLY AND SO

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.406
THAT IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE --

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:19.111
I THINK AS CITIES IN AS WE WE DO

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:20.980
A LOT OF THINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:21.614
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET ON THE

02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:22.882
FREEWAYS --

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:23.983
AND WE DO A LOT IN TERMS OF OUR

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:25.418
OWN PLANNING AND NOT PLANNING

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:27.119
APPROPRIATELY --

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:28.454
WE'VE DONE VERY LITTLE IN TERMS

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.289
OF RAPID TRANSIT IN IN THE STATE

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.724
IN TERMS OF MAKING IT CONVENIENT

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.326
WHEN WE DO IT IN A THOUGHTFUL

02:00:33.392 --> 02:00:35.294
WAY IT DOES ENHANCE I KNOW THAT

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.329
IT'S ENABLE STATE.

02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:37.663
OF PARKING WAS ONE OF THE WORST

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:39.065
THINGS IN THE WORLD ENTRANCE

02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:40.199
WITH AND GETTING ON AND OFF THE

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:41.300
FREEWAY WAS A NIGHTMARE IT'S AN

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:43.402
EAGLE STATE ON THE ON THAT MESA.

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:44.904
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY NOW HAVE

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:47.373
THE TRANSIT COMING THROUGH THE

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.407
CAMPUS.

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:50.376
AND AND AND AND DROPPING

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:52.345
STUDENTS OFF MANY THOSE STUDENTS

02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:53.980
NOW TAKE THE TRANSPORTATION THEY

02:00:54.046 --> 02:00:55.214
LIVE IN OKLAHOMA THEY LIVE AT

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:56.349
THE BEACH WHERE IT IS.

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:57.650
AND THAT THAT --

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:59.151
TRANSIT SYSTEM IS RIGHT THERE ON

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.586
CAMPUS.

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.088
AND MANY OF OUR STUDENTS USE IT

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:03.623
BUT THAT'S RARE THAT'S NOT ON

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:04.390
EVERY CAMPUS.

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:05.725
AND SO AS A RESULT YOU HAVE

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:07.326
FOLKS WHO HAVE TO DRIVE BECAUSE

02:01:07.393 --> 02:01:08.894
IF NOT IT TAKES AND BEFORE THE

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.429
BEFORE THAT WAS ON CAMPUS IT

02:01:10.496 --> 02:01:12.064
WILL TAKE STUDENTS FOR EVER TO

02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:14.500
pTHE BUS DIDN'T COME.

02:01:14.567 --> 02:01:15.935
ALWAYS DIRECTLY THERE TO PUT A

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:16.802
WHERE YOU WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:18.404
DOWNTOWN COME BACK AND THEN IF

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:19.572
YOU HAD TO GO TO A JOB.

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:20.606
YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT IN THE

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:22.141
MIDST OF ALL YOUR CLASSES AND

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.310
EVERYTHING ELSE SO ALL WE HAVE

02:01:24.377 --> 02:01:25.044
TO HAVE STOP OBVIOUSLY PUBLIC

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.512
TRANSIT THAT THAT IS THAT

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.813
SENSIBLE AND WORKS WITH STUDENTS

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.714
SCHEDULE.

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.650
BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF

02:01:30.716 --> 02:01:33.452
THAT THESE.

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:34.353
TWO THE FACT THAT THEY SHOULD

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.489
NOT BE PAYING MORE THAN FACULTY

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:37.223
FOR TRANSPORTATION TOOK FOR

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:39.759
PARKING REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:40.660
WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO DRIVER

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:43.062
NOT DRIVE OR WHATEVER THAT.

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.330
IT IS IT'S JUST UNFAIR THAT

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:45.965
THERE HAS BEEN PUT ON STUDENTS

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.600
TO REALLY CARRY THE BURDEN OF

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:49.635
PUBLIC A PARKING ON CAMPUS IS

02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:51.771
JUST BASED ON THE AMOUNT THAT

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:52.371
THEY HAVE TO PAY IN COMPARISON

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:53.939
TO FACULTY.

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:55.574
MR CHOI.

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:56.909
I THANK YOU I HAVE WATER SO

02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:57.743
COUPLE QUESTIONS --

02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:00.479
TO A DOCTOR WEBER --

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.348
I THINK THIS IS --

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:04.717
PARKING FAIRNESS ACT IS TO IN

02:02:04.784 --> 02:02:06.585
PRINCE BORDER BEREA.

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.387
SUPPORTABLE IN THE TO QUESTION

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.522
NUMBER ONE IS THAT --

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:11.490
YOUR BILL IS A CALIFORNIA STATE

02:02:11.557 --> 02:02:17.763
UNIVERSITY VANESSA.

02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:18.898
A PARKING FAIRNESS ACT OUT.

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:21.801
OF WITH DISH.

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.469
THE NOMINAL MAY BE NOT JUST

02:02:23.536 --> 02:02:25.137
THOSE OF CAL STATE THAT BUT THE

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:27.073
UC SYSTEMS --

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:28.040
AND THEN ALSO OR LAW --

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:31.444
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WHAT

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:34.313
CAN WE MAKE IT OR THE PUBLIC

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:36.048
ALWAYS AS HOW DO YOU EITHER

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:37.450
ELEPHANT TO DO IT ONE BY.

02:02:37.516 --> 02:02:40.286
ITSELF.

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:41.220
THIS IS THE FIRST BITE OF THE

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:42.655
ELEPHANT I'M NOT SURE OF ALL THE

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:44.023
ELEPHANTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:45.558
ALTHOUGH THAT'S THE ISSUE THEY

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:46.826
DEAL WITH THE C. ISSUE AND THE

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.194
AND AND AND AND JUSTICE IS THERE.

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.595
CLEARLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:51.163
YOU SEE WE KNOW THAT YOU SEE

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.131
THAT ANYTHING WE DO WITH THAT

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:53.733
WAS MERELY A SUGGESTION.

02:02:53.799 --> 02:02:55.534
SO -- YEAH

02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:56.635
YOU KNOW --

02:02:56.702 --> 02:02:59.638
AND IF SO WHAT UNDER THE

02:02:59.705 --> 02:02:59.939
INTERNET --

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:01.173
THAN THEY THE COLLEGES ARE HUGE

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:01.907
THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS LARGE

02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:02.708
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:03.876
COMMUNICABLE JUST.

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.678
AND I'VE BEEN SOME COMMUNICABLE

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:06.879
JUST WHAT PARKING WAS FREE.

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.447
BECAUSE IT WAS SO RULES SO FAR

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.049
OUT THE ITSELF UP THEIR ISSUE IS

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:11.183
THAT THEY REPRESENTING THE CAL

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:12.818
STATE SYSTEM SO WE WANT TO FOCUS

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:14.120
ON THAT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEET

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.521
AT ANY TIME BUT YOU CAN'T DO THE

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:17.289
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:18.958
ONE OR THE UC CAN ONE YOU KNOW

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:20.559
THAT'S OKAY SO I GET IT NUMBER

02:03:20.626 --> 02:03:22.328
TWO IS THAT I HEARD THAT THIS IS

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:30.169
A PART OF THE UNION SO

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.938
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE NOT

02:03:33.005 --> 02:03:36.442
BECOME THE FACTOR FOR UNION --

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:38.778
THE SHE ASIAN SO SO EVERYBODY

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:39.779
WOULD PAY THE EQUAL AMOUNT.

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.080
WELL IT IT OBVIOUSLY WILL BE A

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.082
FACTOR AND MAYBE THE FACT THAT

02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:44.383
NOW THE STUDENTS HAVE TO PAY IT

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:46.118
MAY BE LESS OF A BARGAINING.

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:47.520
FOR THE THE FACULTY THE FACULTY

02:03:47.586 --> 02:03:48.487
DIDN'T COME OUT AND OPPOSES

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:49.555
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:51.090
UNFAIRNESS OF IT YOU KNOW COULD

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:52.725
HAVE COME IN AND THEY CHOSE NOT

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:53.726
TO BECAUSE THEY FELT IT WAS

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.593
UNFAIR.

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:56.228
THAT THAT THAT WHEN THEY LOOK AT

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:56.796
IT THE ODD I DON'T THINK IS

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:57.296
THEIR INTENT AS THEIR

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:58.931
NEGOTIATING THEMSELVES TO

02:03:58.998 --> 02:04:00.466
BASICALLY DO THIS TO STUDENTS

02:04:00.533 --> 02:04:01.467
WITH THIS IS JUST.

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:02.868
THE THE THE END RESULT OF WHAT

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:04.970
HAPPENS SO THEY DID NOT COME

02:04:05.037 --> 02:04:06.038
OPPOSED TO THIS BECAUSE THEY

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:07.807
EMPATHIZE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.141
THERE'S SOMEONE FAIRNESS IN THE

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.342
SYSTEM SO --

02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:11.443
THAT'S WHY THEY DELAYED

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.145
IMPLEMENTATION FOR TWO YEARS SO

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.480
THE CAMPUS GETS A CHANCE TO WORK

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:15.681
IT OUT AND DO WHATEVER

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:16.649
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:04:16.715 --> 02:04:18.083
CONVERSATIONS THEY NEED THAT.

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:20.619
AND FIGURE OUT THE FAIRNESS THAT

02:04:20.686 --> 02:04:21.921
NEEDS TO THE PARKING FEES.

02:04:21.987 --> 02:04:24.323
A SHARD BE EXCLUDED IN THAT THE

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.258
NEGOTIATION NOW WE'RE NOT SAYING

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:26.959
THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING IT

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:28.027
WOULDN'T WITH THE WE'RE NOT

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:28.561
SAYING THAT THEY CAN TO GO

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:29.995
SHOULD THEY CAN'T BUT THEY

02:04:30.062 --> 02:04:31.063
OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:32.998
THEM OF THE PRESIDENT.

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:33.833
OF THE CAMPUS OF THOSE ARE DOING

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:34.967
AND GO **** SHINS THAT WHATEVER

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:37.903
THEY AGREED TO HAS TO BE ALSO

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.305
SUPPORTED BY TWO IN TERMS OF

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:39.872
WHAT THE STUDENTS WOULD BE

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:41.640
ASKING FOR WHAT THEY'D ASK THE

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:42.708
STUDENTS TO GET.

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:43.442
IN -- IF --

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:50.249
AFTER NEGOTIATION --

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:53.452
IN NOT REALLY SAID THAT AND THEN

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:59.325
IT THE IN BUT FOR THE FACULTY

02:04:59.391 --> 02:05:01.093
THAT'S UNIVERSE THIS UP IN OUR

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:01.961
SUBSIDIZING.

02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:04.263
SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE OP

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:07.166
FARE SO IT'D BE MOST OF FAIR.

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:10.736
YOU KNOW THEY MAY GET THE MORE --

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:14.440
A PAY RAISE A TO MAKE A MAKE IT

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:15.507
UP UP BUT THAT THE LIST OF POP

02:05:15.574 --> 02:05:16.775
PARKING IS CONCERNED THE BECAUSE

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:17.676
A SELF.

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.578
PARKING STRUCTURES OUT OR SELF

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:20.946
FUNDED.

02:05:21.013 --> 02:05:22.514
AND THAT THEY'LL BE OBVIOUS ALL

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:25.117
OVER TWENTY YEARS OF THE AUDIO

02:05:25.184 --> 02:05:26.552
SO HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE --

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:28.487
THAT THAT THAT THE WOULD BE.

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:28.954
EQUALLY --

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:30.522
DISTRIBUTED THROUGH --

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:32.825
PROJECTED THE PARKING SPACE

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:34.593
SPACES SO SO THAT THAT YOU TO BE

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:35.060
VERY.

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:38.097
CLEAN AND THE FAILURE UP BY NOT

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:40.966
ALLOWING OUR **** NO PARKING

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:49.775

FACULTY MEMBERS [inaudible]

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:53.445
I GUESS BUT ANYWAY THAT'S

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:55.180
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND AND

02:05:55.247 --> 02:05:56.482
AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BARGAIN

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:58.083
ON VARIOUS OTHER THINGS AND

02:05:58.150 --> 02:06:00.152
WORKING CONDITIONS AS WELL --

02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:01.453
BUT THE THING IS THAT --

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.655
IF YOU NOTICE UP AND DOWN THE

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:04.590
STATE THE PARKING FEES ARE

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:05.524
DIFFERENT AND DEPENDING ON THE

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:07.126
CAMPUS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:09.461
NOT CHARGING A IN ONE CAMPUS

02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:10.596

WHETHER THEY WANT STUDENTS TO BE

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:18.737
USED TO SUBSIDIZE THE CALTRANS

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:19.705
SAID A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:20.839
GO INTO IT.

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:23.642
AND WHILE WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:25.477
OUR MAIN FOCUS IS.

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.078
THAT IS THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.346
NOW THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:29.815
SUBSIDIZING FACULTY AND PARKING

TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS OF

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.889
ACTUALLY SEEING A BILL THAT'S

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:20.225
GOING TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:21.493
ON STUDENTS.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.161
AND I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND.

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:24.629
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:25.964
THAT WE'VE HAD STUDENTS WALKING

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:27.499

I DON'T HAVE MY FUNDS DISBURSED

02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:33.305
YET WHAT CAN I DO AND FROM MY

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:35.774
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN MY STAFF

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:36.742
TALKING TO ME.

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:37.943
WE JUST KIND OF SHRUG OUR

02:13:38.009 --> 02:13:39.144
SHOULDERS AND GOLD.

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.278
I DON'T KNOW.

02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:42.147
AND IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE VERY

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:43.915
HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THE

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:44.583
STUDENTS HONORED US.

02:13:44.649 --> 02:13:45.450
WE HAVE A STUDENT RIGHT HERE

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:48.887
THAT JUST TESTIFIED --

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:50.856
ONE THING I DID DO IS I TALKED

02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:52.591
TO PAY HE FITS C IS OUR

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.826
DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

02:13:54.893 --> 02:13:56.428
AT MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE.

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:58.497
AND SHE DID SAY YES THERE IS A

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:01.233
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PELL GRANTS

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:03.001
RECIPIENTS THAT.

02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:04.169
DO HAVE ISSUES MAINLY BECAUSE OF

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:05.971
THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT IS

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.406
ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

02:14:07.472 --> 02:14:09.775
BUT CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS HAVE

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.676
SEEM TO HAVE THE BIGGER ISSUE AS

02:14:11.743 --> 02:14:14.813
FAR AS HAVING FUNDS DISPERSED --

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.681
AT A REASONABLE TIME SO THAT

02:14:16.748 --> 02:14:18.683
THEY CAN PURCHASE COURSE

02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:20.385
MATERIALS AND EVEN SUPPLIES.

02:14:20.452 --> 02:14:21.753
I NEEDED.

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:22.988
ALL RIGHT AT SHE GAVE ME THE

02:14:23.054 --> 02:14:25.424
NUMBER OF EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THE

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:26.925
LAST SPRING OF CAL GRANT --

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:29.161
RECIPIENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:30.695
HAD DISBURSEMENTS DELAY NOW

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:32.931
THAT'S NOT A LARGE NUMBER --

02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:35.300
COMPARED TO THE ENROLLMENT OF

02:14:35.367 --> 02:14:36.668
OUR SCHOOL BUT FOR THOSE EIGHTY

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:41.706
EIGHT STUDENTS THAT MEANS A LOT --

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:44.443
SO THE OTHER THING THAT IS --

02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:45.744
AS I'VE TALKED --

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.045
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON'S

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:48.346
OFFICE --

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:52.217
THE SOMEBODY FROM SERVICE OFFICE

02:14:52.284 --> 02:14:53.185
CALLED ME RECENTLY.

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:55.220
IS THERE IS A HUGE CONCERN OVER

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:58.824
THE COST OF SETTING THIS PROGRAM

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.425
UP.

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:01.960
AND I CAN TALK FROM PERSONAL

02:15:02.027 --> 02:15:03.829
EXPERIENCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:05.564
THAT COST WOULD BE.

02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:06.998
WE HAVE POINTED POINT OF SALE

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:09.034
SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW THAT HANDLE

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:11.069
BILLING WE BILL WE ALLOW YOUR P.

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:12.170
AND S. STUDENTS WE ALLOW

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:15.140
VETERANS WE ALLOW CAL GRANT --

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:16.541
CAO WORK STUDENTS TO ALL COME

02:15:16.608 --> 02:15:18.844
AND PURCHASE BOOKS AND WE CHARGE.

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:20.245
THE BOOKS AGAINST AN ACCOUNT

02:15:20.312 --> 02:15:22.447
FROM A VOUCHER THAT WAS SET UP.

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:23.882
AND WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:24.449
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS VERY

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:27.786
EASILY THIS IS ALREADY SET UP.

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.754
SO IF THERE'S ANY CONCERNED OVER

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.022
THE COST --

02:15:31.089 --> 02:15:32.324
OF SETTING UP A PROGRAM LIKE

02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:33.225
THIS.

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:35.227
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I HAVE NO

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.461
IDEA WHAT THAT IS --

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:37.996
THE QUESTION ALSO CAME ABOUT

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:39.998
WHERE THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.099

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:42.701
NOBLE THAT WILL LEASE THE

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:43.702
BOOKSTORE.

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:44.870
HOW ABOUT THEM I UNFORTUNATELY

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:47.706
CAN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THEM BUT

02:15:47.772 --> 02:15:49.040
I DO HAVE A FRIEND?

BARNES AND NOBLE SIDE.

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:02.053
THEIR SYSTEM IS SET UP TO DO

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.989
BILLING THIS IS JUST ANOTHER.

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:05.790
TAKES.

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:06.525
YOU KNOW THE COST WOULD BE

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:09.694
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO TYPE IN.

02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:11.329

ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE

02:45:25.181 --> 02:45:26.750
