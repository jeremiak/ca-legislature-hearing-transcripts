AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED I WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE. FOR HELPINGUS WITH THE AMENDMENT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO BANKING FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES. THIS BILL WILL HELP BANKS BETTER COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IT ALSO CODIFIES PROTECTIONS UNDER STATE LAW FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE THE INDUSTRY. DESPITE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ON CANNABIS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY. ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS IN THE NATION ARE CURRENTLY BANKING TO CABINET ARCADE BANKING TO CANNABIS BUSINESSES. INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO BANK FOR CANADA'S BUSINESSES MUST COMPLY WITH RIGOROUS MONITORING. AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RISK. THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK ALSO NOTE AS BENSON. A REQUIRES THAT BANKS SERVING THE INDUSTRY FILE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS TO ENSURE THAT A BUSINESS DOES NOT VIOLATE ANY STATE LAW OR IS NOT ENGAGE IN OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE BURDENSOME AND DEMANDING ON STAFF RESOURCES AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW THE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES WHAT A CALIFORNIA CANNABIS. JOINT POWER JOINT POWER TO PUT JOINT. JOINT POWER. BUT THE WORRY THE TO SHARE A BUSINESS TRACK AND TRACE INFORMATION AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENT FOR MAKING WITH THE BUSINESSES. A BANK AT THE REQUEST OF THE BUSINESS THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM TRACKS ALL CAMPUS PRODUCTSTRUMP'S CULTIVATION THE SALE. THIS INFORMATION ALONG WITH OTHER REGULATORY INFORMATION CAN BE USED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO VERIFY THAT EVERY TRANSACTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESSES. PRODUCT AS IS LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW AND EASE THE BURDEN AND COMPLY WITH PRINCE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ADDITIONALLY AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION PASSED IN WASHINGTON STATE. WILL CREATE A STATE HARBOR UNDER STATE LAW TO PROTECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACCOUNTANTS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS CAR MARKETS AND FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KAREN SOMETIME WITH YOU SUCK BUT I ALSO SERVE AS THE EGG EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA. CANNABIS AUTHORITY WHICH IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY -- WE'RE HERE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I COUNTIES OVER THE LAST -- SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN EARNEST WITH THIS STATE TO DEVELOP LOCAL REGULATORY PROGRAMS TO ALLOW FOR COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY WITHIN OUR JURISDICTIONS IN FACT. ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU'VE HEARD PROBABLY PRETTY WIDELY THAT. THAT THERE ARE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE SLOW TO THE TABLE THERE ARE CURRENTLY THIRTY COUNTIES THAT ARE ALLOWING SOME TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION BUT THIS TAKES. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES SO WE'VE COME TOGETHER AS COUNTIES TO FORM A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY ARE CALLED THE CALIFORNIA CAMPUS AT THE ALREADY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING AND MANAGING A STATEWIDE DATA PLATFORM. TO CONSOLIDATE ALL THE REGULATORY CANNABIS STATE OUT FROM BOTH THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL FIRST THIS IS A TOOL FOR LOCAL REGULATORS TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE ABIDING BY THE LAW ON THE UNDERSTAND -- WHAT TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IS HAPPENING WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION BUT THIS IS ALSO A TOOL THAT WE ARE USING TO HELP FACILITATE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY? WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO REGULATE AND ALLOW FOR CANNABIS SALES WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION WE NEED TO PROVIDE THESE TOOLS. TO THE TO THE BUSINESSES THAT WE ARE SERVING IN US SO THAT THEY CAN FUNCTION LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES DO WITH BANK ACCOUNTS WITH WINE AND CREDITS. AND SIMPLE -- AND JUST BANKING SERVICES -- AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE NUMBER OF BANKS NATIONWIDE THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY THERE SOME RISK INVOLVED CREDIT UNIONS AND BANKS HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT RISK. BUT THEIR TOOLS WE CAN GIVE THEM AS WELL TO HELP SORT OF LESSON THAT RISK PROFILE AND AND ALSO -- HEIGHTEN THEIR CERTAINTY THAT EVERY DEPOSIT INTO THEIR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS FROM A LEGAL TRANSACTION NO ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE ANNOUNCES IT REFERENCES THAT IS IT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY VERY INCREMENTAL STEP TOWARDS A LARGER SOLUTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. UNDER FEDERAL LAW IS GUIDANCE GUIDANCE WITHIN SAID IN A FORMER GUIDANCE UNDER THE COAL MEMO BUT THIS ALLOWS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE AGAIN WILLING TO ACCEPT THIS REST. TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY WELL WE'LL WORK ON LARGER FEDERAL SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY SEE THIS BILL DOING AS PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THIS IS A MECHANISM FOR SHARING DATA AND THIS CAN HELP MOVE THE BALL. AND PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. YOU. ANY OTHER WAY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU CAN PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND JUST STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION NO COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE ACT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COULD YOU LINK IT'S PART. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS AT A FRANK ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. JEFF NOON CHAIR MEMBERS BLAKE JOHNSON HOW ABOUT THE STATURE FILMA HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR ONE MORE MEMBER TO SHOW UP -- SO WE CAN GET QUORUM. IRATE SO NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I CAN SEE SOME SOME BENEFITS OUT OF THIS TO BE A LOT FOR SHARING HOWEVER IF -- NO LEGITIMATE THE BUNK -- BANKING ACTIVITIES -- ALLOW THE HOW CAN THEY SHE HAS. A SUCH INFORMATION INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED. WHAT INFORMATION I TALKING ABOUT? I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT SO -- AS I MENTIONED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION ABOUT WHO TO SERVICE AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A RISK ASSOCIATED IF THEY'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT. A CANNABIS CLIENT BECAUSE THERE IS CURRENTLY A CONFLICT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THE FINANCIAL CRIMES NETWORK -- AND FORMER AYE GUIDANCE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS JUST LIKE WE HAVE A LEGAL PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE AND THAT'S A OPPOSING ESSENTIALLY FEDERAL LAW THEY'RE PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THEIR MEMBERS OR THEIR REGULATED ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED PROGRAMS IF THEY'RE GOING. TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THE GUIDELINES THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW AND WHAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW THOSE GUIDELINES IS ACCURATE AND ACTIONABLE DATA SO WHAT I HEAR FROM YOU IS THAT THE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE BANKING INDUSTRY -- OF WHICH ARE DOING -- OR SERVICING THIS -- CAN WAS TO INDUSTRY THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER I THINK. THE AUTHOR MOTION FOR HOME. HOW MANY ARE ALLOW A MINUTE ARE DOING THAT THE BUSINESS -- WITH THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT'S A SMALLER A MUCH SMALLER SUBSET OF THAT NUMBER YES MUCH MORE. IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT EXACT NUMBER WILL BE HAPPY TO GET THEM A NUMBER FOR YOU AND COMMITTEE. SO YOU MEAN -- THOSE OF BANKS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY SERVING -- WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SHARE. THEIR INFORMATION WITH THE US SERVING. WILL COME UP BY THE MOVE SAY OR SAID THEY ARE SERVING. IS THAT THE TYPE OF INFORMATION SHARING YOU ARE REQUIRING. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING MORE LIKE REGULATORY INFORMATION SO THE DAY. THAT WE KEEP TRACK AND TRACE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS THE MONIES THAT COME IN ARE COMING FROM FOREIGN BANKS ARE FROM. YOU KNOW PEOPLE DOING FROM ELECTIVE ATTY IT'S MORE OF WHAT A REGULAR BANK WE KEEP TRACK OF THAT NECESSARY SHARING INFORMATION WITH OTHER BANKS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. DIFFERENT BANCSHARES. ACROSS INFORMATION LET'S SOMETHING IS CHANGED. ALTHOUGH BANG SO RIGHT NOW -- CURRENTLY -- NOW SERVICING -- CANNABIS THE INDUSTRY -- THE FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS WAS STATE CHARTERED BANKS. I CONTEND THAT MOST OF THEM ARE PROBABLY CREDIT UNIONS AND THEY ARE REGULATED BY THEIR OWN FEDERAL REGULATORS. CREDIT UNIONS ARE MOSTLY -- TO CHARTER ON DAY. I BELIEVE SO I'M NOT REPRESENTED FROM THE CREDIT NOT REALLY SURE BUT WE BUT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN FIND OUT FOR YOU. HELLO STATE. THE CREDIT UNION ARE REGULATED AND YEAH EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME SOME VALUE IS ABOUT THAT OF A TO TRACK DOWN THE ACTIVITIES UP BUT THE RIGHT NOW IS IS -- IS A NOT FOR THE ENDORSED BY THE STATE OR FEDERAL I'M NOT SURE. WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO OKAY THANK YOU? MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE AT I I WILL SAY THAT. OUR CREDIT UNIONS ARE BOTH -- OR THEY BOTH HAVE FEDERAL AND STATE -- AUTHORIZATIONS -- AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THE BILL IN THE BILL ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT TRACK AND TRACE DATA SO IT'S NOT ALL DATA. ON THAT BUT I KNOW THAT I REPRESENT AT AT ONE COUNTY THAT HAS A LOT OF CULTIVATION AND SO WHEN YOU THINK OF THE BUSINESSES AND WHERE IT'S GROWING -- THAT WOULD BE IF I'M CORRECT THAT TYPE OF DATA THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TRACK AND TRACE DATA THAT WAS. DISCUSSED. GRANNY AND OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS WE DO HAVE FORM SO I AM LIKE EAGER TO TO TAKE ROLE IF YOU WILL GIVE ME A SECOND SO THAT WE CAN VOTE ON YOUR BILL SO -- IF WE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CALL ROLE PLEASE.

NINE FOUR FIVE AS WELL AS A BE SIX EIGHT NINE I DO WANT TO TAKE A CHURCH POINT OF PRIVILEGE AT THIS MOMENT TO WISH THE VICE CHAIR HAPPY BIRTHDAY. WITH THE NINE FOUR FIVE FIRST FEELING WHEN YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. SO NO AMENDMENTS RIGHT. NOW NOT A NIGHT THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE NO PROPOSED OKAY LET'S CLARIFY. YES. LIKE THAT'S TO MY BRAIN FRAWLEY OTHER COMMITTEES RIGHT YES. YES. GOOD YES I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB NINE FOR FIVE A MEASURE WHICH WOULD ALLOW ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS. THEY MAY INVEST IN SECURE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CALLED. RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE ENTITIES TO DO SO PROVIDES THEM WITH AN OPTION CURRENT LAW PLACES MANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES INVESTMENT THAT SURPLUS FUNDS. FROM LOCAL AGENCIES MAY BE -- INVESTED IN THESE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE -- PROVISIONS THAT STATE INVESTMENTS MUST HAVE HIGH LIQUIDITY AND DON'T POSE A HIGHER RISK TO THE LOCAL AGENCY. THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS BUT SIMPLY INCREASES THE AMOUNT. BY 20% THAT AGENCY SURPLUS FUNDS MAYBE INVESTED FROM 20% 250%. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WHICH HAS SUCH A CAP ON RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS AND WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT IN THIS CASE ARE ENOUGH SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT LIFTING THIS CAP SLIGHTLY WILL NOT PLACE ANY UNDUE RISKS ON LOCAL FUNDS ARE CITY OF SACRAMENTO HERE AND SOME OF OUR LOCAL BANKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WITH ME A TEST OF FIRE TO LOCAL CEOS STEPHEN FLEMING CO RIVER CITY BANK AND JAMES BACK WITH CO TWO FIVE STAR BANK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY ON JAMES BACK WITH ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF FIVE STAR BANK. BY MADAM CHAIRIN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TESTIFY IN FAVOR FOR THIS -- FOR A. B.. NINE FORTY FIVE I RUN A COMMUNITY BANK -- WERE LOCATED HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION AND PUBLIC FUNDS ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE -- OF FUNDING FOR OUR LOANS IN WHICH WE MAKE HERE LOCALLY. THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INCREASE LOCAL LENDING. WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WE PUT IN PLACE ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT I BELIEVE SOME OF YOU MEMBERS OF HER BEFORE IT'S CALLED RISE. RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS FOR A STRONG ECONOMY. SIMPLY PUT THAT PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR REQUIRES THAT -- IN ORDER TO FOR US TO MAKE LOCAL LOANS WE TAKE PUBLIC DEPOSITS PUBLIC DEPOSITS EITHER FROM SPECIAL DISTRICTS. FROM MINUTES APOLOGIES ARE COUNTIES THERE'S THREE DISTINCT WAYS I THINK AS YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD COLLATERALIZED PUBLIC FUNDS WHICH IS THE STATE LAW REQUIREMENTS. JEANNIE EITHER DO IT WITH APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES. YOU CAN DO IT WITH A LETTER OF CREDIT FROM THE FHL BE OF SAN FRANCISCO. OR YOU CAN PLACE THOSE FUNDS AND RECIPROCAL DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIP WHICH ENSURES THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE COMPLETELY 1100% INSURED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT. OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BY FDIC INSURANCE. SO WE'RE ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. MOVING THE LIMITATION WHICH IS TO FIFTY THAT COULD BE A MAKE A MATERIAL. POSITIVE CHANGE FOR OUR ABILITY TO MAKE LOANS LOCALLY -- SPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER SOME OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT WERE WORKING WITH THROUGHOUT. IN CASE OF OUR BANK THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER DOING THIS -- AS ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY MENTION. THIS RESTRICTION DOES NOT EXIST IN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE WOULD ASK FEW -- TO TO MOVE THIS ON TO HELP LOCAL LENDING TO HELP US DO OUR JOB IS COMMUNITY BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. BY FURTHERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU JAMES THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME'S STEVE FLEMING ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF RIVER CITY BANK. WHICH HAS BEEN BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO SINCE -- NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE LIKE FIVE STAR BANK WERE A COMMUNITY BANK WHICH MEANS THAT WE PROVIDE SERVICES. TO CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITHIN A MORE -- DEFINED -- MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAN THOSE AT LARGE AND NATIONAL BANKS OF BRAND NAMES YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF FOR US THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- IS A KEY PART OF OUR CLIENT BASE -- WILL PROBABLY. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO LAST YEAR THE CITY DAVIS -- MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE THEIR BANKING RELATIONSHIP TO RIVER CITY BANK FROM ONE OF THE THE BRAND NAMES WHO'S BEEN IN THE THE NEWS A LOT OF LATE -- WE'RE ALSO PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE LEADING BANK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- FOR THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION INDUSTRY WHICH PROVIDES A CLEAN ENERGY AT A FORMAL PRICING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES -- WHERE THE BANK FOR FIFTEEN OF THOSE TWENTY ENTITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THE AND THAT MANY OF WHICH ARE JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES. AB NINE FORTY FIVE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO US AS IT ALLOWS US TO OFFER HIGHER RATES OF INTEREST -- TO OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE AND POTENTIALLY NEW CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. SO THAT ON BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS THEY CAN EARN MORE INTEREST. THESE DEPOSITS GO INTO EITHER MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS OR CD'S THAT'S A CHOICE OF THE TREASURER OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE WORK WITH. BUT THEY'RE COMPLETELY LIQUID IF THEY THEY WANT TO BE THAT'S A CHOICE THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITY GETS TO MAKE. BROWN'S MOST IMPORTANT -- THEIR MEANS THERE ARE COMPLETELY SAFE AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS. AND THEN LASTLY. AS JAMES MENTIONED -- ALLOWS US TO LEND MORE INTO THE COMMUNITIES WHICH WE SERVE. I WHICH IS GOOD FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOOD FOR JOB CREATION WITH THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT -- WE'RE LIMITED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ONLY 30% OF THOSE DEPOSITS AND LEND THEM OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY SECURITIES. FOR THE OTHER 70% WE HAVE TO ROUTE THAT MONEY INTO -- OBLIGATIONS -- INVESTMENT OBLIGATION OUT OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY TAKING US FROM 3250% HE GIVES US THAT MORE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS KEVIN pGOLD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION FOR THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. WE RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVER.

WE IS -- SAFETY LIQUIDITY. AND INVEST RETURN ARE VERY CRITICAL [inaudible] SO -- THIS PROGRAM IS IS REALLY A WHAT WE CALL SEE DOORS. IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE JUST. IT'S DIFFICULT -- FOR FOR THIS MATTER WHETHER INVESTMENT GUIDELINES BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT ALL INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING INVESTED. VESTED WITH -- YES SOME OF THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS THAT'S GREAT. BUT THEY WANT HIM THEY SPREAD IT OUT WE A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT POOLS. MANY COUNTIES HAVE MUSCLE PULLS. UP TO OVER OVER BILLION DOLLARS. SO WHEN YOU'RE INVESTING IN THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING -- WE INVESTED VERY HEAVILY IN FUNDS LIKE WAVE -- CAMP. WHICH ARE LOCAL ESTATE INVESTMENT POOLS -- AND THEN WE ALSO WORK WITH OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR INVESTMENT GUIDELINES AS FAR AS BROKERS. WITH -- TRADE REASONINGS LIKE THAT SO SAFETY AND SECURITY LIQUIDITY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- NOT ONLY FOR YOUR GAUGE MEANT BUT FOR YOUR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT. ALSO WANNA THANK YOU REMEMBER THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT. ON THIS ISSUE. LET ME FIRST START BY EXPLAINING WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHAT IS NOT. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN WHAT ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO CHARTER A LOCAL BANK. WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO IS IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH REPUBLIC BANK IT ONLY CREATES THE PROCESS FOR THE CHARTERING WHICH IS A MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH MANY REQUIREMENTS? WE CRAFTED A BILL TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC BANK ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED. UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS ARE BILL REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK TO ABIDE BY A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PROTECT ITS ASSETS. IT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Là AND BANKING LAW WITH ALL REPORTING IN TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. AND IN ADDITION TO THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THAT PUBLIC BANKS KEEP THE SAME COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AS PRIVATE BANKS. THE MINUTES WE ACCEPTED -- REQUIRE A PUBLIC BANK TO MAINTAIN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. IN ADDITION THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS OF AN INITIAL BUSINESS PLAN WE ALSO ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO REQUIRE A LOCAL AGENCY THAT WANTS TO APPLY FOR CHARTER TO ANALYZE ALL COSTS. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND THE LEGALITY OF THE BANK. WE ALSO CRAFTER BILL TO SUPPORT LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES PUBLIC BANKS WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES WITH THOSE LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS. THIS IS MODELED AFTER THE PUBLIC BANK OF NEW OF NORTH DAKOTA WHICH FOUR HUNDRED YEARS THIS YEAR HAS SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED WITH LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS WITH PROPER ROLE RETURNS TO THE PUBLIC. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IN OUR OPEN MY OPENING. IS TO RESPOND TO THE MAIN ARGUMENT BY THE OPPOSITION THAT SUPPORTERS OF PUBLIC BANKS HAVEN'T SHOWN HOW THE CURRENT BANKING INDUSTRY DOES NOT MEET THE PUBLIC'S NEEDS. I THINK OF U. S. PUBLIC THEY WOULD HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WOULD ASK CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS WHO EXPERIENCE PREDATORY LENDING. WHO HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES WHO'VE LOST FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION? YOU COULD ASK HOMEOWNERS VICTIMIZED BY MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY GREENLANDERS SMALL BUSINESSES DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL. YOU COULD ALSO PUBLIC WHOSE MONIES ARE INVESTED EVERYDAY AGAINST THEIR VALUES IN FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES GUN MANY FACTORS AND PRIVATE PRISONS AND COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES. ARE PUBLIC AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE FORCED TO INVEST OUR SAVINGS AND ASSETS IN THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS WALL STREET BANKS WHO HAVE ENJOYED SOARING PROFITABILITY. WALL STREET BANKS WHO FAILED US. WITH OUR BILL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO KEEP TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO SEND RECORD PROFITS TO WALL STREET INVESTORS TO CREATE LOCAL JOBS THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND STABILIZE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE PUBLIC'S MONEY SHOULD SERVE A PUBLIC PURPOSE NOT SIMPLY MAXIMIZE PROFITS. THIS TIME I LIKE TO ASK MY JOINT AUTHORED TO PROVIDE HIS PERSPECTIVE THE TWO OF US REPRESENT TWO OF TEN AREAS OF THE STATE. OF THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN ASKING FOR A PROCESS TO CHARTER A LOCAL PUBLIC BANK. AND MISTER SANTIAGO HAS BEEN A TRUE PARTNER IN THIS BILL MR SANTIAGO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HELPING US TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL I ALSO WANT TO THINK ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS -- WHO SENT UP THERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HELPING US TO WORK ON THIS LOOK THIS IS A SERIOUS POLICY PROPOSAL? AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSAL ALL IT SAYS IS. IS IF A LOCAL MUNICIPALITY ONCE THE FED UP A BANK THAT THEY SHOULD GO THROUGH A PROCESS THE FED ABATEMENT. THERE SHOULD BE A THEY SHOULD BE A NEW WAY OF DOING STUFF I WON'T ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. BUT I BUT YOU EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE OF THE BANK NO SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD A MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS OPEN NO SOMEBODY WHO LOST THEIR HOMES RIGHT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM. AT THE TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WOULD THINK THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING BANKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHY NOT START HERE WITH A PUBLIC BANK FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD COULD YOU IMAGINE A BANK THAT MAKES DECISIONS BASED ON THE PUBLIC GOOD. AS OPPOSED TO DECISIONS MADE BASED ON THE BOTTOM LINE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. AT THE END THE DAY I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO THINGS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. NOT MORE NOT SAY WE DON'T SUPPORT A BUSINESS RUN THING WE DON'T SUPPORT AN ECONOMY WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND YET PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD BE WE NEED ANOTHER OPTION IN CALIFORNIA FOR A BANKING SYSTEM IN THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE THAT ALTERNATIVE. WHY NOT WE'VE GOT CORPORATE BANKS? WE'VE GOT COMMUNITY BANKS AND WE'VE GOT CREDIT UNIONS WHY NOT A PUBLIC BANK THAT'LL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AND I WILL I LET. THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AS I WOULD LET THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NO THAT WILL HAVE EIGHT MINUTES -- FOR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS SUSHIL JACOB I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE AND LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE IS AN ALLIANCE OF ADVOCATES FROM TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES. RANGING FROM SAN DIEGO UP TO EUREKA. IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE HAD TEN RESOLUTION SPECIFICALLY ENDORSING AB -- EIGHT FIVE SEVEN EITHER INTRODUCED OR PASSED INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND BERKELEY SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND COMING UP WE HAVE THE SAN JOSE AS WELL. THIS LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES. AT A PUBLIC BANK [inaudible] TO IDENTIFY. IN ITS ARTICLES HOW IT COULD BE IT'S EITHER. PROMOTING A SOCIAL PURPOSE OR SPECIFIC PUBLIC BENEFIT. IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN FDIC INSURANCE. IT INCORPORATES EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR PUBLIC DOLLARS INCLUDING COLLATERALS ASIAN REQUIREMENTS IT DOES NOT REQUIRE INVESTMENT OR DEPOSITS OF ANY SPECIFIC POOL OF FUNDS -- IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK TO COMPLY WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LAW AND THE BANKING LAW -- AND IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANK WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE DEFINED AS COMMUNITY BANKS -- CDF EYES AND CREDIT UNIONS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSION WITH THE CREDIT UNION LEAGUE MOVING FORWARDS TO COME. TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM -- I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCES IN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THE PUBLIC BANKING PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD ALLOW. OUR CITIES COUNTIES AND REGIONS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DESCENT TANGLING THEIR BANKING FROM. OVER RELIANCE ON WALL STREET MEGAMIX. FOLLOWING THE MODEL OF THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY. WHILE FINANCING PROJECTS THROUGH LOANS FROM PUBLIC BANKS -- IN IT DITION SIMILAR TO THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA -- WHO WHICH HAS A ROLE AS A CENTRAL WHOLESALE BANK FOR THAT STATE? AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN PUBLIC BANKS WILL REVIVE THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR ON A REGIONAL BASIS BY PARTNERING WITH THEM ON LARGE LOANS AND PROVIDING OTHER SUPPORT -- BY AN ACTING AB. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN CALIFORNIA WILL ENABLE THE CREATION OF LOCAL PUBLIC BANK THAT WILL TRULY SERVE THEIR REGIONAL ECONOMIES LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTH AND LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IBOOK THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER FINGER I AM EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT FOR BENEFICIAL STATE BANCORP. BENEFICIAL STATE BANK IS SO BILLION DOLLARS SEE DFI HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC BANKING INITIATIVES -- BENEFICIAL STATE BANK IS A MISSION ORIENTED BANK A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION WE ARE OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE FAIR AND TRANSPARENT BANKING SERVICES. TO THE UNDERSERVED -- WHICH ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES -- THE BANK SUPPORTS THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC BANK. PARTICULARLY AT THE STATE OR REGIONAL LEVEL WHERE IT WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT SCALE IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR VIEW A PUBLIC BANK WILL MORE CLOSELY ALIGN. PUBLIC DEPOSITS WITH THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. THE END OF BENEFIT THE PUBLIC GOOD. OF WE ALSO FEEL THAT A PUBLIC BANK SHOULD BE ALIGNING WITH CDF BUYS AND OF CREDIT UNIONS IN ORDER TO DO THINGS LIKE FINANCE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHICH WOULD BE. BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF MANY LOCAL CDF BUYS AND CREDIT UNIONS TO WORK ON WE ALSO FEEL THAT A PUBLIC BANK CAN SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY INITIATIVES THAT. A COMMUNITY BANK ON ITS OWN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AS WELL IT CAN ALSO SUPPORT LOW INCOME HOUSING INITIATIVES AND WORKFORCE HOUSING WHICH ARE SO BADLY NEEDED. AND WE ALSO FEEL THAT IT WILL HELP US TAKE BACK MUNICIPAL FINANCING FROM THE WALL STREET BANKS. AND SO -- BENEFICIAL STATE FOUNDATION WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE PARENT OF BENEFICIAL STATE BANK SUPPORTS AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND IS ALSO AN ACTIVE SUPPORTER OF THE CALIFORNIA A BANKING ALLIANCE.

GREAT THANK YOU MEMBER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE THE MEASURE -- THAT WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO CREATE PUBLIC BANKS USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS -- COMING FROM -- THE PART ME LET ME START BACK UP MICHAEL'S EGGMAN MINUS YOU KNOW BANK CONTRAST COVERING THE SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES -- WE HAVE THIRTEEN BRANCHES THERE AND ARE ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS IN SIZE -- THE THE AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS -- IN REALITY THE MEASURE WILL CREATE A TAXED ADVANTAGE ENTITY THAT WILL DIRECTLY COMPETE WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND THE GREAT WORK IN WHICH WE DO -- IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION -- WAS ABLE TO RETURN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL DONATIONS TO NONPROFIT ENTITIES -- SERVE FIFTY ONE HUNDRED TOTAL VOLUNTEER HOURS -- WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE OF OUR TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES VOLUNTEERING FOR THOSE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND WORTHY WE ARE THE LARGEST SMALL BUSINESS LENDER IN OUR FOOTPRINT OUTPACING ALL OF THE LARGE NAME BRAND BANKS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER -- IN TO GIVE YOU A QUICK. OVERVIEW OF SOME SOME GREAT THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AND THINGS THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THOSE -- DEPOSITS -- THAT WOULD BE GOING BACK TO PUBLIC BANKS THIS LAST YEAR AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN DURING THE FLOOD IN DEBRIS FLOW -- WE WERE ABLE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN VERY UNIQUE WAYS -- THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WITHOUT THE LIQUIDITY FROM LOCAL DEPOSITS -- WE WERE ABLE -- TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY -- SYSTEM WITHIN AN HOUR -- BRANCHES WITH IN OUR FOOT PRINT -- GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE CREATED -- LOAN PROGRAMS FOR THOSE -- IMPACTED CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A LONG WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOUR TURNAROUND TIME -- THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO THEM -- WE ALSO WERE ABLE -- TO YOU CREATE PAYMENT DEFERRALS ON ALREADY EXISTING LOANS AND FREE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES FOR THOSE THAT WERE IMPACTED IN THOSE AREAS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALSO NOTES -- YOU KNOW WE WERE DELIVERING YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND WATER BOTTLES TO OUR LOCAL -- YOU COMMUNITY FIFTEENTH OUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED RESPIRATORS TO LOCAL RESIDENTS AND YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE STREETS AND BE ABLE TO LEND THAT MONEY BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US. IN WITHOUT THE LOCAL DEPOSITS THAT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. FROM MADAM CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS -- TRACHEA -- BE COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR HE REPRESENTING -- AGAIN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S -- WE STARTED THIS BILL ALLOWING PEOPLE TEND A LOT OF THE MEETINGS AND SESSIONS. A AND WE WE REALLY ARE POSED -- ONE THING WAS CITIES AND COUNTIES NEED A VERY ROBUST BANKING SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE -- BILL REPORTING RECONCILIATION ONLINE ONLINE AVAILABILITY POSITIVE PAY -- PLATFORM THAT WILL SUPPORT WIRES A C. H. E. IN IT HAS TO BE VERY ROBUST IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING SIMPLE. AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF TIMES ONE OF THE LARGER COUNTIES WILL WORK WITHOUT SOME OF THE LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS BECAUSE THEY OFFER THOSE SERVICES -- SO TO THINK THAT THE THIS THE STATE CAN CREATE THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND INVEST IN THAT AND IT WITH THE CAPITAL COSTS WOULD BE TREMENDOUS. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES DONE ON THIS AFTER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND OTHER -- CONSULTANTS AND I BELIEVE THE YOU KNOW THE THE CAPITAL COSTS WERE VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND I THINK WAS ABOUT A THIRTY YEAR PAY BACK. OF FOR THE BANKS AFTER ACTUALLY BECOME PROFITABLE -- SO AGAIN -- THE CHURCH OFFICE IN AND THE COUNTY TREASURER'S SITUATION OR A VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THIS. ONE THING THAT'S CRITICAL FOR US ALSO IS IS IS SAFETY LIQUIDITY. OF OUR FUNDS. AND THEN -- ALSO INVEST RETURN IS PRETTY CRITICAL -- WILL HAVE VERY STRICT INVESTMENT GUIDELINES AND POLICIES AND AND WE NEED TO FALL THOSE SO -- WE ARE VERY MUCH AGAINST THIS BILL. WE FEEL THAT IT'S IT'S THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME SPENT ON THIS -- DEAD AND IT'S USUALLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF TRACTION. SO [inaudible] COMPLETE. MADAM CHAIR NUMBER THE COMMITTEES. MY NAME IS JEREMIAH SMITH FROM THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR FIRST NORTHERN BANK TO COMMUNITY BANK FOUNDED IN. NINETEEN TEN I'M ALSO THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE. AND RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. A BEING FROM A COMMUNITY BANK THAT SERVES THAT STRIVE TO SERVE ALL IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH INCLUDES EVERYONE ON THE SOCIO ECONOMIC SPECTRUM. I HAVE A SUBSTANDARD CONCERNS THAT IF THIS BILL IS PASSED BANKS LIKE FIRST NORTHERN. WHICH ARE LOCATED UP AND DOWN THE STATE WILL FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY SUCCEED. I AM SURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS BUT WE USE MUNICIPAL DEPOSITS TO FOCUS ON MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNITY FROM CLEAN ENERGY. TO NONPROFIT LENDING AND OF COURSE TO SMALL BUSINESS LENDING WHICH IS YOUR ALSO WHERE IS THE HEART BEAT OF OUR RULE TOWNS AND CITIES. WITH THIS ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE WORK WITH A MOM AND POP BUSINESSES THAT ARE LIKE MANY OF THE BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICTS. TO HELP REVITALIZE COMMUNITIES AND MANY OF THESE CASES WE PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE FORM OF GUARANTEES THE THE CAL CAP PROGRAM. WHICH WE FEEL HAS BEEN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY FOR THE STATE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION THE INDUSTRY PROVIDES MUCH REALLY NEEDED FUNDING FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS LIKE LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR SENIORS FAMILIES AND VETERANS. IF YOU LIKE I'M SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING ON AROUND THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNNECESSARY RISK TO TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT THIS CREATES. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT WERE COMMISSIONED BY DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE STATE INTO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EACH RECOMMENDED AGAINST A STATE OR MUNICIPAL RUN BANK. AND FORECASTED SUSTAINED LOSSES ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO THIRTY YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. SO IN CONCLUSION I BELIEVE THAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS DOING A GREAT JOB OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF THE WONDERFUL DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. WE HELP SMALL BUSINESSES NONPROFITS AND ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL AND I WORRY THAT THIS BILLS INTENT. COULD MAKE THAT MORE CHALLENGING ENHANCE FOR THE REASONS STATED AND RESPECTIVELY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED ENERGY TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. JASON LANE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. MARGARET LATCHING ON HELP THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK IN OPPOSITION. KRISTIN MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF BAY AREA COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. EMILY EIG NUMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH PROPONENTS AND APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DIALOGUE. ELLERY NEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED IT IS ON A JOCULAR LIST. ALL RIGHT I SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABOUT BAUER-KAHAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM WELL FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON WHAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS I THINK. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO AS A COMMITTEE AND IS ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY IS SAFELY HELD IN THAT THE AMENDMENTS. DO THAT I THINK THAT THE D. V. O. AND AFTER I SEE OVERSIGHT FROM CHARTER THROUGH CONTINUATION IS CRUCIAL TO THAT I ALSO THINK. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND IF THE LOCAL ENTITIES CAN SHOW THAT THEY CAN DO THIS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO GIVE IT TO THEM -- I ALSO SEE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN THIS I ACTUALLY WISH SHE WOULD HAVE ALSO ADDED EDUCATION LOANS SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK TOWARD LOWER INTEREST EDUCATION ONCE IT'S SOMETHING OUR STUDENTS DEEPLY NEED -- BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION I'M CONCERNED WITH. THE FISCAL IMPACT ON OUR GENERAL FUND OF HAVING OUR MONEY MOVE INTO PUBLICLY HELD BANKS THAT ARE NOT TAXED. SO WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY OUT OF BANKS IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PAY STATE TAXES AND PUTTING THEM INTO BANKS THAT WOULD NOT PAY STATE TAXES NOT COULD POTENTIALLY HIT THE GENERAL FUND I UNDERSTAND THE RE THE BENEFITS FINANCIAL BENEFITS BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A FINANCIAL RISK. TO OUR STATE FUND OF DOING THIS YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. I THINK MY FIRST REACTION IS IF YOU HAVE PUBLIC MONIES THE IDEA OF TAKING PUBLIC MONIES THAT ARE ALREADY TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THE TAXING THEM AGAIN MEANS YOU'RE HITTING THAT MONEY TWICE. I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT A BIT AGAIN. THE IDEA OF SAYING THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONIES OUGHT TO BE TAXED AGAIN THROUGH THE BANKING SYSTEM. YES ON THE ONE HAND IT WILL HAVE. IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND DEPENDING ON WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING A LOCAL JURISDICTION CHOOSES TO SPEND ON IT BUT BUT I THINK A ALLOWING IN A JURISDICTION TO HANG ON TO AS MUCH OF THE TAXPAYER FUNDS THAT ARE IN ITS BANK. I THINK IT'S ALSO A BENEFIT THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BALANCE OUT. NUMBER SAN DIEGO YEAH AND I THINK I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT THE SAVING THE DOLLARS RATHER THAN THAN -- THAN HAVING A PRIVATE ENTITY INVEST THOSE DOLLARS FOR THAT BENEFIT AS OPPOSED. TO A COMMUNITY BANK INVESTING DOLLARS FORTY COMMUNITIES BENEFITS I THINK THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BUT LET ME ALSO SAY SOMETHING. THAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT POOR LOCAL CONTROL FUNNY WHAT BETTER WAY FOR A LOCAL -- MISS A PALETTE ENSURE THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE DOLLARS ARE YOU FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR PLACES AS OPPOSED A STATEWIDE -- SERVICE I MEAN CERTAINLY. I MEAN IF IF I FIRED REPRESENT AN AREA AND WORKING IN THE I WOULD WANT EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR WITHIN THAT AIR TO WORK FOR THAT PARTICULAR AREA THAT'S WHAT WE GET SENT UP HERE FOR BUT THAT'S THE ONE MONTH ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. IF YOU'RE IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION AND I JURISDICTION THE SIZE THE TAKE ON A PUBLIC BANK -- ALL THE DOLLARS THAT WOULD'VE BEEN PAID STATEWIDE WOULD ARE. SPREAD ACROSS A WIDE YOU WOULD WANT THOSE DOLLARS INVESTED THE LOCAL LEVEL SO IT ACTUALLY MAKES A LOT BETTER SENSE. LOCAL CONTROL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND I DO WANT TO SAY IF ANYBODY FROM THE SUPPORT SIDE OR OPPOSITION SIDE OF ONE OF EACH ONE IS THAT JOIN THE TABLE YOU'RE WELCOME TO IF YOU WANT BUT AS A MEMBER WICKS THANK YOU TERM. I THINK -- THE AUTHORS AND AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE ON THIS BILL I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OBVIOUSLY BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY -- YOU KNOWN AS A MEMBER TO YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT -- HAVE FACED OUR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT -- THE WELLS FARGO SCANDALS WE'VE HAD PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES WE HAD THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS ON MANY ISSUES THIS COMMITTEE HAS GRAPPLED WITH. AN OVER THE YEARS AND YOU SEE THE GUTTING OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU BY THE CURRENT -- IT FEDERAL MINISTRATION AND I THINK WHAT A LOT OF THESE THINGS HAVE DONE HAVE LED TO AN EROSION -- OF TRUST IN OUR BANKING SYSTEM UNDER OCEAN OF TRUST IN WHERE AND HOW ARE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES -- PUT THEIR MONEY AND HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR MONEY -- AROSE IN TRUST AND OUR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND FRANKLY INTER OCEAN TRUST IN OUR SOCIAL CONTRACT. A AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL -- WILL AIM. TO HOPEFULLY BE A VEHICLE TO TRY TO BUILD BACK SOME OF THAT TRUST -- AND I THINK IT'S A COMING UPON THIS BODY TO HAVE THOSE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS AND MOVE THIS BILL FORD SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- YOU KNOWI BELIEVE A PROPOSED PUBLIC BANK CAN INVEST IN THE NEEDS OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ARE YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING RENEWABLE ENERGY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CENTRO WHICH I THINK IS ANOTHER EXCITING ELEMENT ABOUT THIS BANK -- AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANKS ARTICLES IN A CORPORATION TO IDENTIFY A SOCIAL PURPLISH PURPOSE. OR A PUBLIC BENEFIT I WHICH IS ALSO EXCITING MY QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS IN THE ADVOCATES OF THE TABLES. COULD YOU SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON HOW A PUBLIC BANK WILL BE GOVERNED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE LOCAL NEEDS BY COMMUNITIES ARE BEING MAX I DO THINK THIS IS AN EXCITING PART OF THIS BILL. YES THANK YOU [inaudible] SO THE THE ONE OF THE MOMENT SO WE'VE ACCEPTED REQUIRES THAT THE BANK ORGANIZER'S -- SUBMITTED STUDY WHICH SHOW HOW THERE WOULD BE A CLEAR. SEPARATION OF THE ELECTED AND BANK MANAGERS AND PREVENT ANY CAUGHT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY IN OUR LEGISLATION -- BEYOND THAT WE LEAVE THAT UP TO THE ORGANIZERS TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BANK LET'S TRY THE LOCAL AGENCY WHETHER TO CITY OR JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY? AND THE BANK SIDE HOW DO THEY ACT AS SHAREHOLDERS IN. CONTROLLING THE BOARD OF THE BANK -- BUT I DO I YOU KNOW THERE'S SPECIFIC PROTECTION FOR THE IN LEGISLATION GREAT I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION IN A DIFFERENT WAY AS IS IN YOUR ANALYSIS. A PUBLIC BANK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY IN ITS ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION EITHER SOCIAL PURPOSE OR SPECIFIC PUBLIC BENEFITS. I AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY REPORTING SO THAT YOU'RE MEETING THOSE NEEDS THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR PRIVATE BANKS WE KNOW THAT A PRIVATE BANK. DAY EXIST FOR SHAREHOLDER PROFIT THEY EXIST TO MAXIMIZE. THE RETURNS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR INVESTORS -- I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT UNLIKE PRIVATE BANKS ARE BILL HAS ANOTHER REQUIREMENT -- THAT A PUBLIC BANK ABIDE BY A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PROTECT ITS ASSETS AND AGAIN. THE IMPERATIVE THE ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE OF A PRIVATE BANK. IS NOT THAT SIR ONE APPOINT THOSE TWO OUT AS DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN WHAT A PUBLIC BACK IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND WHAT PRIVATE BAXTER. THANK YOU [inaudible] DECEMBER CHOI. THANKS CHAIR AND NOW THANK YOU AUTHORS OF FOR THE PRESENTATION -- I HAVE RECEIVED -- A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ON OR SO. ATTENTION TO THIS BILL. SO I DO HERE -- MANY BENEFITS -- THIS -- IDEA IS -- FOR THE UP PUBLIC A GOOD. THIS BILL IS THE ONLY. ARE AUTHORIZING -- THE MINUTES FOR GOVERNMENTS -- TO DECIDE -- TO IT ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANG SOMEONE KNOCKED ON OUR SIDE I DO SEE SOME SOME -- BAND IF FISHER ASPECTS UP BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- I WOULD LIKE. TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. THAT THAT THE OF FAIRNESS ISSUE. A THAT IS -- THIS ONE WOULD BE -- ULTIMATELY. ARE. I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE OF WHAT YOUR BILL EXACTLY SAYING IF -- A CITY -- CHOOSE IS SET TO ESTABLISH A A BAND GOAL OF TONY ESTABLISHES A BANKER. IS THAT THE ULTIMATE THE RESPONSIBLE BODY. ARE IF AND WHEN THE BANK FAILS. AND THEN THE TAX MONEY -- WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY -- I'M I'M SURE -- YOU MAY HAVE A SOME MECHANISMS AT THIS WATER. ARE. BUT TRACK THE ALLOWED WAY INVESTMENTS OF PUBLIC. DOLLARS SO INTO HATE US SO THAT THE THE SENATE THE A DIFFERENT ASPECT THAT THAT THE DIFFERENT IN. A PLAYING FIELD. WHEN -- THIS PUBLIC BANKS OPERATE THAT WITH THE BENEFITS. ALREADY IS A TEAM THEY ARE ON WHEN THEY COMPETE AGAINST A COMMERCIAL BANKS. SO -- A HOME. TOWN FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE IF AND WHEN IT FABIO SELF GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE. ARE AND IF THIS A MUNICIPAL OWNED GOVERNMENT OWNED THE BANK SO PUBLIC BACK THAT THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. WHETHER YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT. IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THE LOCAL WILL THIS BE IS A SEPARATE ENTITY LIKE A AND AS SHE IN A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. AND THAT THAT'LL BE MY FIRST AND THE SECOND QUESTION -- RELATED TO YEARS SELF ARE. ON FAIR PLAYING FIELD. WITH A BUILT IN BENEFITS SAID THAT THE PUBLIC BANKS WILL HAVE A SO THAT MEANS SO -- THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL BANKS OUT WOULD BE -- ARE PLACED IN UNFAIR -- PLAYING FIELD AND THE LOSING ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS ALREADY ARE. ACCORDING THE PUBLIC DOLLARS IN THE ORDER MOVED AWAY. INTO THIS FROM. PUBLIC BANKS. A SODA. IF AND WHEN THERE IS -- UP AREAS SO THAT THE COMMERCIAL AGAINST AND NOT PERFORMING WE ARE FOR THE COMMUNITY. WE COULD ABA. INITIATED A CHANGING THE REGULATIONS AND RULES. BUT RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING SO THESE ARE TOOL OF FIRST THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LOOK TO HEAR FROM YOU. LET ME START AND ANSWER WITH A COUPLE THINGS FIRST -- WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS -- IN ORDER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTION TO EVEN CONSIDER STARTING A CHARTER BANK YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE THE COST YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE CAPITAL YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS YOU NEED TO DO A LEGAL ANALYSIS. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STEPS YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER BEFORE A LOCAL JURISDICTION -- AND AND YOU AND I BOTH SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WOULD EVEN CONSIDER TO TAKE THE STEP OF APPLY FOR CHARTER. ONCE A LOCAL JURISDICTION DECIDES TO TAKE THAT STEP THEN IT HAS TO MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SET UP BY THE STATE AND WHAT THIS BILL SAYS. IS WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR PUBLIC BANKS WITH REGARDS TO HOW THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES THEY NEED TO KEEP THE SAME COLLATERALS NATION. THEY HAVE TO KEEP FDIC. INSURANCE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME SAFE CARDS AND THAT'S JUST TO GO THROUGH THE MULTI YEAR PERIOD JUST TO GET CHARTER. ONCE YOU'RE CHARTERED STATE REGULATORS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT I WANT TO SUGGEST IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BANK FAILS. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WALL STREET BANKS FAILED. THEY DESTROYED COUNTLESS JOBS WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS PREDATORY LENDING NOT MONEY TO SMALL BUSINESSES THE FAILURES OF PRIVATE BANKS. HAS HAD ENORMOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTROL THEIR OWN FATE. LET LOCAL COMMUNITIES TAKE THEIR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS AND DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE TAX DOLLARS INVESTED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO SENDING. THE MONEY TO WALL STREET AND HAVING WALL STREET INVESTED IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH COMMUNITIES. BUT INDUSTRIES THAT MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BELIEVER JEOPARDIZING WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IN CALIFORNIA. ANY OTHER. ANSWERS. AS I REMEMBER SHE DID YOU I'M SORRY AS A MEMBER AT CHOI DID YOU WANT. TO HEAR FROM ANYONE ELSE SPECIFICALLY OR THE OPPOSITION. I JUST DON'T. WANT TO HEAR ANY OF THE OPINIONS. YEAH MY QUESTION IS YOUR YOUR ADDRESS WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL ENTITIES SO. UNDER AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN A PUBLIC BANK IS A BANK CORPORATION TO SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY FROM ITS OWNER WHICH WOULD BE THE LOCAL AGENCY. SAID THERE'S A M.. IN TERMS OF LIABILITY FOR THE DEBTS OF THE BANK THOSE STAY WITH THE BANK AND THE BANK CORPORATION. AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. WAS SAYING THESE. BANKS HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS TERMS OF PROTECTING TAX DOLLARS THAT CURRENTLY APPLIED PRIVATE BANKS. SO WHAT IS THE OUR RISK ANALYSIS SO OF WHAT IS THE ABOLITION GUEST OF NEW SYSTEM PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM. OUR VERSUS -- THAT THE TRYING. TO A CHANGE WHO ARE IMPROVE THE SERVICE AREA SAID THAT CURRENTLY -- OF PUBLIC BANKS ARE NOT MADE I MEAN THE COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE NOT MEETING FOR THE CLIENTS. IF I UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE -- YOU INVEST YOUR LOCAL DOLLARS IN A PUBLIC BANKING YOU AND AND IT'S FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AS OPPOSED TO INVESTING DOLLARS -- FOR A RAID RETURN THAT WE CALL PROFIT. AS YOU HEARD AWHILE AGO -- ALL. THE BANG SAID THAT I HAVE. WORKED WITH AYE HERE IS THAT THE LOCAL BANKS -- THEY HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN THE A COMMUNITY AND THAT THEY DO RETURN. THEIR BENEFITS -- AND THE PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES SO IN INTO IN THE FORMS OF ON AND OFF GIVING MONEY AND SPONSORING EVENTS ETCETERA LACK OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS -- THEY HALFWAY INVESTED THE IN THE COMMUNITY -- ACTIVITIES -- SO ARE. I MEAN THERE MAY BE SOME LACKING AREAS -- COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE NOT MEETING SO IF WE CAN REQUIRE - THE MISSING PIECES SO FOR THEM TO STRENGTH AND NOT BY. OUR SO THAT RATHER THAN -- UNKNOWN CHARTER THAT THE WE ARE TRYING -- TO ESTABLISH AN AND I HEAR THAT NORTH DAKOTA EXAMPLE HALLWAYS OUT HOW IT THE THAT THE BANK IS UP. A PERFORMING WHAT I HEAR ABOUT IS THAT THAT THE SYSTEM WAS TO SET UP A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND A NORTH DAKOTA -- ECONOMY IS SO I'M NOT THE POPULATION. VERY FRACTION OF A CALIFORNIA LIKE A 2% SO IT IS A NOT A GOOD REALLY GOOD A COMPARISON. OF THE SYSTEM AND THE NORTH -- THE STATE SAYS SO FAR I KNOW THAT SUCCESSFULLY THIS A PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM HAVE WAS SUCCEEDED SO THE RISK RISK FACTOR IS THE ABOLITION NEW. NEW SYSTEM OFFERS SAYS -- TRYING -- TO THAT CHANGING IN THE DEMANDING COMMERCIAL BANKS CURRENT THE EXISTING -- TO IMPROVE THE ERA LACKING AREAS. OF THROUGH A WILL -- REGULATIONS -- ARE. LEGISLATION SO WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS DONE THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS OF LOCKED IN. I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION AND A COUPLE HUESO LET ME BE CLEAR THAT OUR BILL IS REALLY. FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THE LARGEST AND I REFER TO THEM AS WALL STREET BANKS INTERNATIONAL BANKS HAVE HAVE FAILED. OUR QUIBBLE IS NOT WITH CREDIT UNIONS ARE QUIBBLE IS NOT WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND THIS IS WHY WE SPECIFICALLY LEGISLATING OR BILL. LANGUAGE THAT SAYS WE SUPPORT THOSE LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. SO IF YOU READ THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT A PUBLIC BANK WILL PARTNER WITH LOCAL INSTITUTIONS WILL CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES WITH THOSE CONSTITUTIONS. THAT IS THE MODEL OF THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA AND WHILE YOU'RE UPS TO CORRECT THE STATE IN NORTH DAKOTA DOES HAVE A SMALL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE NOT PROPOSING A STATE BANK WITH THIS BILL WE'RE PROPOSING THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ESTABLISHING LOCAL BANKS. SO I WANTED TO MAKE MENTION THAT AND THEN ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION IS. WITHOUT PUBLIC BANKS OVER THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE LARGEST BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THEIR OF THEIR MARKET COMPETITIVENESS HAVE ESSENTIALLY KILLED 75% OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL BANKS. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THEY WERE A LITTLE UNDER FIVE HUNDRED BANKS. IN THE STATE OF IN OUR STATE TODAY THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOLSTER THAT COMMUNITY BANKING WORLD. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR US TO DO BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE INDUSTRY HAS CANNIBALIZED ITSELF AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL OUR OWN ASSETS AND I'LL JUST USE THE EXAMPLE. OF THE CITY THAT TIME FROM -- WE TYPICALLY BANK ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WITH THESE LARGEST INSTITUTIONS IF WE COULD USE THE INTEREST OFF THAT. AYE AND INVESTED IN OUR IT IN IN THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE -- WE WOULD GET MUCH MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK UP RATHER THAN SAYING IN IT TOO NEW YORK INSTITUTIONS WHO INVESTED IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT THEY WANT THAT ARE NOT IN OUR STATE. AND GIVE US BACK VERY LOW INTEREST RATES WE COULD KEEP THAT MONEY IN OUR STATE KEEP THAT MONEY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND USE IT TO INVEST. IN THOSE PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN INVESTMENT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO. THE FACT IS YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE. MANY MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL THERE MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MORTGAGES THERE MANY CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET LOANS -- THERE MANY STUDENTS WHO BEEN UNABLE TO GET UP FAIR STUDENT LOANS AND I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUT IF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CHOSE TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS LOCALLY. THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT% PICTURE SO IT'S ALL ABOUT AGAIN LOCAL CONTROL. ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL WHERE ITS MONEY IS USED WARTS MONEY IS INVESTED BUT BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR WOMAN HAD ASKED US. FOR ENSURING THAT THE STANDARDS THAT PUBLIC BANKS ARE REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN ARE THE SAME STANDARDS THAT PRIVATE BANKS ARE ENGAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION -- IT IT'S ALSO REALLY COOL -- THOUGHT THAT THE MONEY WOULD BECOME MORE AVAILABLE LOCALLY AND THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW TRADITIONALLY DID NOT HAVE A I WANT IRVINE'S MANY TO STAND IRVINE YEAH. IT IN ANY WE ARE NOT ONLY JUST -- LOCAL COULD BUT IT YEAH. OUR BUT HERE LOOKING AT THE JUST A AND NOT A QUESTION IS A QUITE INTERESTING TO SUB -- TOLD OF COMPARE SUPPORT GROUP UPPER OF US IS -- OPPOSITION GROUPS -- A SUPPORT GROUP -- TENDS TO BE MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF SUCH AS A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WORK TELL ME TREASURER SEND THE TAX COLLECTORS. CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF CREDIT UNIONS SO IN A TECH SAPIEHA SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AT CETERA -- WHERE IS -- SUPPORT GROUP BUT TENDS TO BE MORE -- ENTITIES -- NOT IN IN IN THE IN THAT IN INDUSTRY A SUCH AS SUCH JUST A SUPPORT GROUP BANKING ALLY AND SO -- NO REINVESTMENT COMES SO -- WAS OF COURAGE CAMPAIGN -- OR IS THIS A FOSS SEWER FREE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFFICE AND SAN FERNANDO VALLEY -- RISING ALLIANCE WHATEVER THAT IS -- SOME FLYABLE SUNFLOWER LE IS DECEMBER CHOI DOES IT HAVE A QUESTIONS OR AND THE OPPOSITE ON WHEN I SAID THAT THIS IS A NON MY QUESTION. I'M I'M TRYING TO SEE THAT. AT THE SUPPORT GROUP VERSUS TO OPPOSITION GROUPS OF EXPERTISE SOMEONE MAY HAVE ANALYZED AT THIS KIND OF IDEAS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT VERY BRIEFLY -- AND AND I AGAIN WITH REGARDS TO THE CREDIT UNIONS THE COMMUNITY BANKS I WANT TO PUT THEM ASIDE% BECAUSE MY HOPE IS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AND HOPEFULLY -- WORK OUT ISSUES TWO TWO SO THAT TO THOSE WORLDS CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO TO PARTNER WITH THEM -- BUT ON THE OPPOSITION LIST ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVESTED IN THE STATUS QUO AND I'M JUST SAYING THAT FACTUALLY WE HAVE A CURRENT SYSTEM. THAT HAS BEEN FAILING BUT THE LARGEST BANKS WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDABLE ECONOMIC INTEREST IN CONTINUING THE STATUS QUO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE VERY LENGTHY LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF OUR BILL. REPRESENT THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THE PUBLIC. WHO HAVE BEEN WHO HAVE NOT FOUND THE CURRENT BANKING SYSTEM TO WORK FOR OUR PUBLIC THESE ARE OUR CONSUMERS THESE ARE OUR HOMEOWNERS THESE ARE OUR STUDENTS? THESE ARE OUR BUYER MENTALIST WHO SEE THE MONIES THAT ARE BEING INVESTED IN FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES THESE ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO SEE EVERY DAY. THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM. IS THE GENTLEMAN NOT IN A POSITION -- CAN AT THE SOME OF QUESTIONS SO. WELL I LIKE TO ANSWER JUST A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS IF I COULD -- I THINK THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT STRUCTURALLY THE BILL IS NOT COMPETING WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND I I THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT CORRECT -- YOU HEARD FROM COMMUNITY BANKERS WHO CBA ALSO REPRESENTS IN ADDITION TO LARGER INSTITUTIONS -- STATE THAT -- TAKING OF THOSE DEPOSITS IMPAIRS THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE LOANS INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT WE ARE TAKING PUBLIC DEPOSITS THAT CURRENTLY ARE USED BY COMMUNITY BANKS AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO MAKE LOANS. AND PUTTING THEM INTO A GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT HAS NO RETAIL PRESENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVING ACCESS TO CAPITAL THIS WILL ONLY MAKE THAT WORSE. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS THE NOTION OF TAXES AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BEING ASKED. IF THE BILL DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES IT PURPORTS TO CREATE A SEPARATE CORPORATE STRUCTURED INTO DE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY THAT CORPORATION CAN'T PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAXES. IF THE GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND COMPLEMENT COMMUNITY BANKING CREDIT UNIONS. THEN LET'S ALLOW THE PUBLIC BANK TO ALSO PAY TAXES. TAXES ARE GOOD ARE THEY NOT THEY FIX OUR ROADS THEY HELP ARE NEEDY THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WE HAVE A GENUINE CONCERN AND NEED TO HAVE GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN -- FOR THE NOTION THAT THAT WHAT IS NOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR FOR CORPORATIONS -- IS NOT GOOD FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT THAT SEEMS TO US TO BE A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS. AND FINALLY I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHOES NEW FOUND ADMIRATION FROM NORTH DAKOTA IT IS OFTEN USED AS A MODEL FOR PUBLIC BANKING -- UNFORTUNATELY NORTH DAKOTA HAS A G. P. THAT IS THE SIZE OF A OXEN ART IT IS LITERALLY 2% OF CALIFORNIANS GDP IT LOST MONEY. IT'S PUBLIC BANK. LOST MONEY FOR TWELVE YEARS BEFORE IT BEGAN MAKING MONEY. THAT'S TAX PAYER MONEY. WE WILL HAVE YOU RESPOND I KNOW THAT AS A MEMBER GABRIEL ALSO HAS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY TO ASK QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I JUST WANT -- TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU -- OFFERED AND I THINK THE AUTHORS FOR ACCEPTING THOSE MOMENTS I THINK THAT THEY WERE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ADD SOME REALLY STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR TAXPAYER FUNDS -- AND JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS AND THEN. A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS YOU KNOW I WAS -- VERY INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA PUBLIC BANKING WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT -- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FRUSTRATION BROADLY WITH SOME OF THE ACTORS IN THE PRIVATE BANKING SYSTEM I THINK THE IDEA OF INCREASING COMPETITION AND LETTING. PUBLIC BANKS COMPETE AGAINST PRIVATE BANKS IS A GOOD IDEA I'M IN FAVOR OF THAT TYPE OF COMPETITION IN THE MARKET. I WILL SAY WOULD GIVE ME SOME PAUSE ON THE IDEA WAS THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT WE HAD AND AND IT WAS PRETTY PARTICULAR I'M I'M ABOUT 90% SURE OF THIS BUT IT WAS THE CITY TREASURER IN THE FROM SAN FRANCISCO JOSE CISNEROS WHO CAME IN. AND REALLY -- OFFERED US A NOTE OF CAUTION AND AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO. SHARES A LOT OF PROGRESSIVE EYES THAT I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS HAVE BUT SUGGESTED THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE OUGHTA PROCEED WITH CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC BANKING -- IT GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF THE FACT THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE PUBLIC BACON I BELIEVE IT WAS GERMANY ACTUALLY PAY NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES. MUCH OF THE PAY TO KEEP THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK SO THAT THEY HAVEN'T -- THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY -- YOU KNOW SUCCEEDED IN THE WAY THAT I THINK SUPPORTERS THERE WOULD HAVE HOPED -- AND ALSO REALLY URGE DISCUSSION THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ENTITIES FAIL AND THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TAXPAYER MONEY IT'S THAT -- IS THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAN IN IT AND INEVITABLY HAVE TO END UP CUT WOULD END UP CUTTING SERVICES NO SERVICES MAY BE. SERVICES THAT BENEFIT THE POOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND AND REALLY HURT COMMUNITIES AND AND AND IN A WAY IN IN SOME WAYS THERE COULD BE A LOT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FROM PUBLIC BANK SO. I VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL GO BEYOND OUR CONSIDER GOING BEYOND THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS THERE -- FOR PROTECTIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOW BECAUSE THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S MONEY THIS IS THE MONEY THAT IS USED TO FIND SOME OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY IS PROTECTED SO I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S SUPPORT FOR THIS CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE. BUT I DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL AS IT PROGRESSES THAT WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND THAT WE ARE PROTECTING TAXPAYER RESOURCES BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT THEY ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF OF GOOD INTENTIONS GONE BAD OR WE COULD END. UP HARMING EXACTLY THOSE FOLKS THAT WE ARE -- INTENDED HELPS I DON'T KNOW IF -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SINCE HE IS FROM YOUR CITY I TELL YOU WRITING IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE FROM THE CITY TREASURE BUT THOSE REALLY MADE ME THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE NEED TO BE IT. DO IT THOUGHTFULLY DELIBERATELY SLOWLY AND REALLY PROCEED WITH CAUTION. SO I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT THE WAY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MOVING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND SOMETHING THAT -- MISTER SANTIAGO AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AT GREAT LENGTH IS ARE VERY PROFOUND HOPE AND DESIRE. THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE A PUBLIC BANK THAT IS CHARTER BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT FAILS. AND I THINK WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE IS PUT SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE THAT THAT HAPPENS AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CITY. OF A PUBLIC BANK DOES FAIL HAVING TO CUT SERVICES WHEN I WOULD ASK PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT IS THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS HAD TO SPEND. BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF WALL STREET BANKS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO PERPETRATE LANDING I COULD GO ON AND ON WITH THE LIST? BUT BOB WE KNOW A SYSTEM THAT HAS FAILED AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS IS THERE ANOTHER OPTION -- NOW I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH MY CITIES GREAT TREASURE JOSE CISNEROS. AND THEY'RE REALLY TWO THINGS THAT I WOULD JUST NOTE ABOUT HIS PERSPECTIVE. FIRST HE DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE VERY HIGH COST ESTIMATES OF WHAT IS GOING TO TO TO STATE STARTUP THESE BANKS -- AND USUALLY THOSE OUT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THIS COMMITTEE IS EVEN IF THOSE COST ESTIMATES ARE HIGH THAT'S NOT A REASON TO SAY THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTION SHOULDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE. TO TRY THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOCAL COMMUNITY TO PUT A BUSINESS PLAN TOGETHER THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO START A BANK WITH PROFITABILITY AND LESSEN SAY THE TWELVE YEARS THAT WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA AND BY THE WAY. THE BANK NORTH DAKOTA'S BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN NINETEEN IT DID TAKE A DOZEN YEARS FOR TO GET UP TO PROFITABILITY BUT IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT. PROFITABILITY THAT'S THE KIND OF PROFITABILITY THAT WE'D LIKE TO BRING BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND AND AND IF I CAN JUST TO CLOSE. EVEN IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO START A PUBLIC BANK IF FOR SETTING THE GROUND RULES CORRECTLY. AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IS ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN WHY WOULD WE NOT ALLOW THAT AS AN OPTION TO THE STATUS QUO THE STATUS QUO HAS FAILED US. MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS. I WILL ADD THAT A THINK THAT THE WHEN WE STARTED THAT THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR WE STARTED WITH A HEARING AND IT WAS A HEARING RELATED. TO TO REALLY DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY OF WHAT PUBLIC BANKING COULD LOOK LIKE -- AT THAT POINT THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT A STATE BANK AS WELL AND AND I THINK AS THE CONVERSATION PROGRESSED AND AND AS THINGS PROGRESS IN OUR LEGISLATURE THEY OFTEN DO SO BECAUSE OF A BILL -- IF THERE'S A BILL THERE IS A CONVERSATION -- ABOUT THIS I REALLY TIED TO THINK ABOUT THIS BILL -- FROM THE LANDS OF THE BANKING PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW IN TODAY'S CONVERSATION AND AND THE DIALOGUE BACK AND FORTH THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A A LOT OF ELEMENTS AND ELEMENTS RELATED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND I YOU KNOW SHOULD THIS COULD BILL GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY IT MOVES OVER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I KNOW THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE -- WILL HAVE THAT LANDS ON TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- ARE THE RIGHT SPACE AND WHAT KINDS OF A RISK -- AND OPPORTUNITIES -- SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD PRESENT BUT FROM A BANKING PERSPECTIVE -- AS I HEARD TODAY AND I'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION THERE HAS BEEN AN INTEREST TO HAVE A EQUAL. UP PLAYING FIELD -- BEFORE AN ENTITY AND DOING SO THE ALSO MEANS NOT JUST CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO THE SAFEGUARDS. UP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ACHIEVE THAT -- AND DO SO AGAIN FROM A BANKING FLAT LANDS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY AND I THINK IT THAT BY ALLOWING THEM. THE REGULATORY BARRIERS BARRIERS. FOR TO BE THE SAME REALLY FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL BANKS -- WAS SOMETHING THAT. WE DON'T I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT AND I THINK THAT THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT. IS BEING TAKEN DOES THAT WE HAVE NOW CREATED -- THAT SIMILAR REGULATORY BARRIERS BARRIERS FOR COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC BANKS TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION. AS HAS BEEN SAID THIS BILL DOESN'T CREATE A PUBLIC BANK THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR A PROCESS AT TO BE CREATED OF FOR A PUBLIC BANK. I I THINK THAT -- TO IT WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT THAT. TO WE UNDERSTAND THAT. WHETHER WE LIKE SOMETHING OR NOT NO ONE GETS A FREE PASS ON THIS STILL HAS TO GO. THROUGH -- THE DB OWE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT CHARTER APPLICATION PROCESS AND TO IT HAS FTA SEE. OVERSIGHT THE FDA SEAT PORTION OF IT -- WHICH IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO SECURE THE PUBLIC'S -- FUNDING BUT ALSO THE FTA SEE WORKS TO M. HE IN SUCH A WAY LIKE OF A CHRIS A CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WHAT IS THE OUTSIDE ENTITY THAT WOULD COME IN TO HELP -- OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND SO THAT ALLEN IS INCLUDED HERE AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. I DO THINK THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE IS ANY KIND OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING SPECIAL DISTRICTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. BOARDS OF EDUCATION AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT THE BILL ALLOWS IT'S NOT JUST CITIES OR COUNTIES AND CLEARLY THERE ARE CAPACITIES. THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES SO I KNOW THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT THAT -- TOO IT'S ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT A COUNTY OR CITY COULD DO I'M VERSES WHAT A SCHOOL YOU KNOW BOARD COULD DO AND AND THEY WOULD ALL BE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH AGAIN THIS PROCESS I THINK THE PROCESS IS RIGOROUS -- AT THE FOUNDATION THOUGH OF THIS. AND I SAID THIS IN THE IN THE IN THE HEARING. THERE HAS TO BE SOME REFLECTION ON WHY. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WANT. AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT TO WHAT'S ALREADY THERE. I WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT OUR COMMUNITY BANKS AND I KNOW MONEY SEE TO BANK AND TRUST IS HERE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE AND HELPING OUR COMMUNITY THAT THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT OF THE THOMAS FIRE. I'M IN THE DEBRIS FLOW -- IN A GREAT TIME OF NEED -- WE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THAT LEVEL OF DISASTER AND NOT ONLY WERE THEY THERE AT AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO HELP. OUR COMMUNITY MOVE THROUGH THREE EMERGENCY LOANS AT THROUGH LONG TERM LOANS BUT ALSO AS VOLUNTEERS AND JUST HUMANS THAT WERE TAKING CARE OF OUR COMMUNITY WHEN IT WAS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE LOST IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT NOT ALL ENTITIES DO BUSINESS IN THE SAME WAY -- BUT I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE TO REFLECT ON WHY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE. PRODUCT. THE LEGISLATURE THOSE REASONS -- THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO HANDLE AND ASSESS AND ADDRESS HOW TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE REASONS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT -- I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION IS CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO THIS HEARING ROOM OR TO THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING IN A PUBLIC WAY. I DO KNOW THAT. THERE ARE BANKS WHO ARE RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS -- OF THE PUBLIC AND HEARING WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE -- INCLUDING AB. I MEAN THERE WAS ONE THAT. DIVESTED FROM THE PA -- THE PRIVATE PRISON A SYSTEM -- IN RECENT MONTHS AND IF IT IT IT AND I WANT AS TO RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS CONVERSATION IS. ONE ASKED FOR BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BUT TO ALSO AT NEEDED IN A WAY SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS WHAT CONSUMERS ARE ASKING FOR I I THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S REALLY THE VEHICLE BUT THE ASK IS FROM THE PUBLIC. AND THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING FOR PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MEET THEIR NEED -- AND THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THE PUBLIC BANK COULD BE -- ONE OF THOSE AB PRODUCTS IT'S NOT LIKE A PRODUCT PER SE BUT A SYSTEM -- THAT COULD DO THAT. SO I SHARE THOSE COMMENTS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS -- ENGAGEMENT IN THIS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION SINCE DAY -- ONE ABOUT THIS I DON'T THINK THAT ANY PART OF THIS IS NECESSARILY PERFECT BUT I DO THINK THAT -- THE KID THE LENS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS REALLY BEEN FROM A BANKING PERSPECTIVE FROM A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS HOW DO WE ASSESS THIS -- AND THOSE COULD BE DIFFERENT AS IT MOVES TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- SO JUST SOME THOUGHTS TO THINK ABOUT I DO APPRECIATE ALSO -- ALLOF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IN INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION -- FOLKS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN IN OUR OFFICE HAVE BEEN -- INVOLVED WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ---BUT ALSO A THINK THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS I'M FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE REALLY DOING. THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IS IT THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DELIVER THE OUTCOME THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WANT US TO DELIVER AND WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE -- SO EIGHT EIGHT AGAIN I THINK YOU TO THAT TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS. TWO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOMMENDATION. AND SO WITH THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION AND WE HAVE A SECOND. WITH THE MEMBERS LIKE TO CLOSE. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR REAL DELIBERATION ON THIS I KNOW THIS IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION AND I PARTICULARLY AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF WHO HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS THINKING THIS THROUGH THIS IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION. ONE JUST -- ADDRESS ONE THING AND THEN CLOSE WITH ONE POINT WHICH HAS -- AGAIN OUR INTENT TO WITH OUR BILL IS TO PARTNER WITH CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS BECAUSE WE HAVE FEW THOSE FINANCE AND INSTITUTIONS. AS HAVING THE THE THE THE MIND OF THE PUBLIC -- AT HEART -- AND I ALSO MENTION CREDIT UNIONS ALSO DO NOT PAY TAXES BUT THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION -- BUT ONE THING I WILL ALSO STATE JUST TO CLOSE HIS I KNOW THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT FOR SOME -- BUT THAT WAS TRUE FOR MANY AREAS OF GOVERNMENT. THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY THERE WAS A TIME IN AMERICA WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND THEN THE PRIVATE HEALTH SYSTEM FAILED AND WE NOW HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THERE WAS A TIME IN AMERICAN WE DIDN'T HAVE A PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM BUT THE PRIVATE TRANSIT SYSTEM FAILED AND SO THAT SYSTEM CAME ABOUT THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT PUBLIC EDUCATION THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT PUBLIC HOUSING. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS AREA? IS AT THE PRIVATE BANKING INDUSTRY UNFORTUNATELY HAS FAILED AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CREATING A NEW TYPE OF INSTITUTION THAT COULD HOPEFULLY ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC'S. INTERESTS ARE IN MIND TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE BEING INVESTED FOR COMMUNITIES AND CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE KIND OF COMMUNITIES AT ONE ELEVEN WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM TURNOUT WANNA -- THANK YOU PARTICULAR FOR LAST COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY BE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY THERE THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS -- TO MAKE SURE I AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS IS IS A GOOD BILL THAT CAN ACTUALLY GET EMPLOYMENT SO I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL APPROACH. AND THAT THE ECHO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS THOMAS LIKE IF YOU'VE WRITTEN MY TALKING POINTS BUT BUT BUT NO LOOK NEW IDEAS ARE TOUGH AND THEY'RE CHALLENGING BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM YOU GOTTA GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY -- AT THE END OF THE DAY I TRUE BLUE TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC BANKS IS COME. AND THIS TOOK ME ABOUT ABOUT A YEAR OF LOOKING INTO IT AN AND CHEWING ON INDIAN. AND HAVING DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS BUT WHEN YOU REALLY GET DOWN TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF IT -- I THINK THERE'S A RULE BOOK PUBLIC A BENEFIT TO THIS AND THERE'S A RULE PUBLIC GOOD ABOUT. AN ABOUT CHALLENGING THE WAY WE INVEST OUR DOLLARS WHERE WE INVEST OUR DOLLARS AND AND WHAT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD REALLY ULTIMATELY BE DOING AND AND YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY IT'S IT'S UNIQUE BECAUSE I THINK THE FRAMING OF FROM THE OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY. ARM IS ALMOST IS ALMOST VIEW LIKE AS AN ATTACK ON THE INDUSTRY IN SOME CASES IT'S REALLY NOT I MEAN THERE'SNOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT LOOKS TOWARDS REFORMING TOWARDS CHANGING TOWARDS MODIFYING PORTS TOUCHING. ON THE INDUSTRY. MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT TO THE FROM BILL AND MAYBE THAT CONVERSATION WILL SPARK UP IF. IF THOSE VOICES GET LOUDER -- BUT THAT'S NOT THE CONVERSATION THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE CONVERSATION OF THIS HAPPEN RIGHT NOW IS JUST JUST LET AN ALTERNATIVE OF FORMER BANKING EXIST -- I DON'T I DON'T RECALL TOO MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WERE FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A AND I'LL PICK A COUPLE IN NAMES OF AUTO DEALERS THERE IS A TOYOTA THERE IS A CHEVRON -- CYBER SEVEN CHEVY OTHERS A GM WHO'S ARGUING ODD TO NOT HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF VEHICLE ON THE MARKET. ALL IN THE WAY THAT I LOOKED AT THIS AT THIS YOU'RE JUST GIVING ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE FOR FOLKS TO BANK. AND WHAT WE CALL THE PUBLIC BANK. WHICH I BELIEVE IN OTHERS THAT WOULD SERVE THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND IT WILL ALLOW LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO GO THREE VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO SET UP A BANK. I AND IT WOULD BE INSURED AND THEN IT'S A NEW DAY AND IT'S A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT BANKING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING AND VERY THOUGHTFUL IN DEPTH CONVERSATION AND FOR MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CHIU IN ALL THE CITIES IN CO AUTHORS WHO WERE PRACTICING. AND AND ALSO A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL THE ALL THE PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS TO INVEST IN THE TIME IT IS BECAUSE THE STATE'S COME. THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN [inaudible] THANKS. WITH THAT WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS REFER TO COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIMON I LIMóN I CHAN. CHAN NO. BAUER-KAHAN. THERE CAN I BURKE [inaudible] CERVANTES. CHOI. CHOI NO GABRIEL. CABLE I GRAYSON [inaudible] MELENDEZ [inaudible] STONE. STONE I WEBER. WICKS FIVE WEEKS HI. THE BILL HAS FOR US FIVE VOTES NOW NEEDS TO MORE VOTES TO MOVE FORWARD. WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR AT ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SOUND WILL HAVE YOU GO NEXT [inaudible] BUT THE THAT WAS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER STONE. SO. LET'S SWITCH TO STUDENT LOANS. WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE AB THREE SEVEN SIX THANK YOU AB THREE SEVENTY SIX IS ABOUT STUDENT DEBT. ADD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE HUNDRED I'M JUST GOING TO ASK IF FOLKS CAN JUST QUIETLY MOVE OUT SO WE CAN HEAR THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU SOME MEMBERS DOWN WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN OUTSTANDING STUDENT LOAN DEBT WITH. THREE POINT SEVEN EIGHT MILLION BORROWERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS LEVEL THIS LEVEL OF DEBT IS SECOND ONLY TO HOME MORTGAGES. AND IT IS. ESSENTIALLY ENTIRELY ON REGULATED HOME MORTGAGES ARE REGULATED CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY REGULATED THERE'S SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF IT WERE CONSUMERS HAVE PROTECTIONS BUT NOT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THIS IS REACHED A REALLY CRISIS LEVELS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS SET UP. TO TRY AND START TO REGULATE THIS IN FACT THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICING BILL WHICH WAS PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WE HAD INTENDED TO TAILOR THAT TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS BUT THEN FEDERAL REGULATIONS. WENT AWAY SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING NO ASSISTANCE WHATSOEVER TO CONSUMERS AND THIS IS NOW BEING LEFT MORE AND MORE TO STATES. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT LOAN LICENSING PROGRAM THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. BUT THERE STILL IS A LARGE GAP THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU HAS BEEN DE FUNDED TO A POINT WHERE IT IS ESSENTIALLY DOES NOT EXIST AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES IN FACT -- NO WE'RE INTERESTED IN THIS NEED A CONSUMER FACING REGULATORY ORGANIZATION. IN ORDER TO COMPLETE WHAT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND REALLY HELP MANAGE THE THAT. CONSUMERS THAT THE THE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE OUT THERE SO THAT THAT. ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT TAKING UNDUE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS SO WHAT IS AB THREE SEVENTY SIXTY WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT LOANS FORCING WE'RE NOT TALKING AT THIS POINT ABOUT DECREASING STUDENT THAT. BY PUTTING MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM OR FINDING WAYS WHICH WE DO NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT. STUDENTS ARE NOT BEING BURDENED BY SIGNIFICANT THAT. BUT WE NEED TO BE PRO PUTTING IN PLACE PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST TO THE ROLL BACK TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE NEED TO DEFINE PROTECTIONS FOR THE BAR WAS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM BECAUSE TOO OFTEN. THE SERVICERS ARE NOT GIVING CORRECT INFORMATION TO THE TO ESSENTIALLY THEIR CLIENTS WHO THEY FEEL ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS. ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THEIR DEBT AND WHEN THE STUDENT BORROWERS GO TO THEIR SERVICES TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE WHAT THE RULES ARE HOW THAT THEY CAN MANAGE THE DEBT. THEY ARE OFTEN GIVEN INFORMATION THAT LEADS TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO LEAD TO PROLONG THE DEBT AND WAYS THAT ARE NOT HELPING THEM COME OUT OF THAT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STUDENT BORROWER ADVOCATE IN OUR STATE REALLY START TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BETTER PROTECT. THIS LEVEL OF CONSUMERS IN OUR STATE. GET OUR HANDS AROUND THIS AMOUNT OF DEBT AS WE THEN WORK TO TRY TO LOWER IT AND FIND BETTER WAYS TO ENSURE THAT. PEOPLE CAN GET THROUGH SCHOOL WITHOUT CARING THAT THAT AND THEN THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING THE DEBT ARE TREATED FAIRLY KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND KNOW HOW TO MANAGE. THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AND I ABOUT. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SET FROGMAN AND IT IT IS AN HONOR TO BE TESTIFYING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ONCE MORE. AS IT DEMONSTRATES HOW CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN PROTECTING STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. AS THE FORMER TOP FEDERAL REGULATOR FOR THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS. DOWN ONE PATH OUR LEADERS CHOOSE TO STAND UP FOR THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STRUGGLING UNDER HISTORIC DEBT. DOWN THE OTHER THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY HAS FREE REIGN TO RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER A GENERATION OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. IT IS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT STATES CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATH. MILLIONS OF FAMILIES DEPEND UPON IT. TODAY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS COLLECTIVELY -- MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. MORE THAN HALF A MILLION OF THESE BORROWERS ARE AT LEAST TWO STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS BEHIND. PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE HURTING. AND THEY NEED YOUR HELP. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE DOCUMENTED HOW THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY HAS FAILED EVERY TYPE OF BORROWER WITH EVERY TYPE OF LOAN. FROM HER FIRST BILL UNTIL HER LAST PAYMENT. WE SEE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS RIPOFF SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS LIGHT A PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS TRICK OLDER AMERICANS IN TWO YEARS OF UNEXPECTED DEBT. AND UNFORTUNATELY I COULD GO ON AND ON I CAME TO SACRAMENTO TODAY TO MAKE ONE SIMPLE POINT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO RIDE TO THE RESCUE THERE IS NO CAVALRY ON THE HORIZON. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW FAR BETSY DEVICE IN THE ENTIRE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL GO. UTILIZING THE FULL POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE DETRIMENT OF FORTY FOUR MILLION AMERICANS INCLUDING THREE MILLION RIGHT HERE IN THIS STATE. BUT FORTUNATELY THESE BORROWERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE POWER TO STAND UP FOR ITS CITIZENS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S LEGISLATION DOES EXACTLY THIS. SO I JUST LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THIS. YOU WILL HEAR FROM INDUSTRY THAT CALIFORNIA CANNOT ACT THAT BETSY DEVICE HAS IT UNDER CONTROL. THAT THERE IS ALREADY A ROBUST SET OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT INDUSTRY IS WRONG DECEPTIVELY AND DANGEROUSLY WRONG. YOU WILL HEAR THAT STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA SHOULD STEP ASIDE AND LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HANDLE QUOTE A FEDERAL ASSET. BUT CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE A CALIFORNIA ASSET ITS GREATEST ASSET. CALIFORNIA HAS THE POWER TO ACT CALIFORNIANS ARE DEPENDING ON IT THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS WHO SAN MARTIN DE WITH CONSUMER REPORTS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE COALITION AWARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND AS MR FROM ELUDED. TO YOU WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A CALORIE COMING TO THE DOOR I CAN TELL YOU AS AN ADVOCATE WHO HEARS FROM BARS EVERY DAY AS WELL AS ONE OF THOSE THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION. I HAVE MY OWN LOANS -- THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE FACE DEALING WITH LOAN SERVICERS ARE DEPRESSINGLY COMMON. AND THEY CRIED OUT FOR LEGISLATIVE FIX I CAN GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES I GOT IN THE LAST WEEK A WOMAN WHO EMAILED ME HER NAME IS STEPHANIE SHE IS A VETERAN WITH A DISABILITY. JUST FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LOANS. AND SHE WORKS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A FEDERAL LOANS AND FORBEARANCE THIS WOMAN WHO CLEARLY COULD QUALIFY FOR PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS BUT HER SERVICES OF NEVER GIVING HER THE PAPERWORK. SHE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT ON HER OWN SHE SENT SOMETHING IN WHICH IS NOT SURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GOD AND SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS WELL HER FEDERAL LOANS ARE ACCRUING INTEREST AS WE SPEAK. AND HE'S CLEARLY SHOULD BE ON THE PATH FOR PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS OF BETTER OR WITH A DISABILITY WHO MIGHT EVEN IF HER DISABILITY IS DIM SEVERE QUALIFY FOR A LOAN JUST CHARGE ON THOSE FEDERAL LAWS FOR HER LOANS ARE GROWING BIGGER EVERY DAY. SECOND EXAMPLE MAN IN A MANUAL HE WENT TO A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE OF THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE ULTIMATELY WAS SO BADLY MISMANAGED OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I BELIEVE UNDER BETSY TO BOSS. YANK THEIR FUND ARE THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR TITLE FOR FINANCIAL AID THIS PERSON PROBABLY QUALIFIES FOR LOAN DOES CHARGE AT LEAST ON THEIR FEDERAL LOANS. ON THE BASIS OF THE BAR DEFENSE BECAUSE THEY WERE MISLED I DID NOT GET THE EDUCATION THEY WERE PROMISED HOWEVER HIS LOANS ARE ALL IN FORBEARANCE HE'S NOT MAKING ANY PAYMENTS ON HIS DEBT IS GROWING TO THIS DAY. THE FINAL TO SAY VERY BRIEFLY I HAVE BEEN IN REPAYMENT ON MY LOANS FOR ALMOST A DECADE. I AM IN REPAYMENT AND MANAGING TO KEEP UP WITH IT BUT ALMOST EVERY YEAR I HAVE A PAPERWORK PROBLEM. TO WHERE I HAVE DELAYS ARE THE SERVICES LOSE MY PAPERWORK THEY PUT MY LOANS INTO FORBEARANCE WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME AND AS A RESULT I MORE NOW THAN WHEN I GRADUATED TEN YEARS AGO -- SO IF IT CAN HAPPEN TO ME AND I WORK ON THIS FOR A LIVING. IT CAN HAPPEN TO LITERALLY ANYBODY AND THAT IS WHY IT IS HIGH TIME THE CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP AS IT IS WELL POISED TO DO WITH MR STONE A LEADING THIS CHARGE AND SO WE ARE STRONG IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND REALLY APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. IF YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND NOW THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. HI JERRY FOR MEN FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT. HI A PARTIAL SEVEN WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION WERE IN SUPPORT.

IS ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR -- ESTIMATES STONE I SEE YOUR INTENT OF YOU ARE A BILL IS -- TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS SO. BUT THE LITERALLY THE YOUR BILL IS -- TELLING PAPER -- TO SUE FOR THEIR FABIO'S. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. AUTHORIZING CONSUMERS TO TO THROUGH THE SERVICERS. I MEAN SERVICERS ARE JOB IS -- A PROVIDING THE GUIDELINES AND HELPING THE CONSUMERS SO WHEN -- THEY NEED -- EXTERNAL HELP -- FOR BUT THE WHEN THE PERSON IS -- IN THE POSITION WHO -- MAY HAVE A SOME DIFFICULTY THAT AND I THINK THAT THEY ME OUT FOR ON THIS KIND OF A B. R. AND IT. ALLOWS ME TO SCHOOL MY SERVICE PROVIDER AND THAT'S JUST ENCOURAGING. NO LAWSUIT SO. I DON'T KNOW. THE WHOLE WHOLE. TREATING YOU THIS PMR IS ENCOURAGING OR OTHERWISE IF THE US AT ANY. MISCONDUCT -- WITHOUT TELLING THEM TO SUIT THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY SO. THAT'S AN ASTONISHING QUESTION AND I THINK THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU IS HERE IS A DIRECT QUOTE. FROM THE LARGEST STUDENT LOAN SERVICER IN THE COUNTRY THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE. THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT THE SERVICER WILL ACT IN THE INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER. THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE. THE SERVICERS FEEL ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER SO IF WE ARE PROVIDING TOOLS FOR THAT CONSUMER. THE TAKE ACTION FOR THEMSELVES WAR. UNDER THIS BILL ESPECIALLY TOOLS FOR LOCAL PROSECUTORS DA'S OTHERS TO TAKE ACTION ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS THEN I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING. SO HOW DOES A JUDGE SAY BRIEFLY SO -- WHILE I WORKED AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WE RECEIVED. SIXTY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS OVER THE COURSE OF LITTLE MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS. AND WHAT THOSE COMPLAINTS REALLY SHOWED WAS THAT THESE WERE BORROWERS DESPERATELY TRYING TO PAY BACK THEIR BILLS THESE WERE BORROWERS WHO ARE REACHING OUT. FOR HELP -- AFTER THEIR LOAN GOT LOST IN THE SERVICING TRANSFER WHO KNEW THAT THE WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND WE'RE ENTITLED -- TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR LOAN FORGIVEN BECAUSE PROMISES MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE EXAMPLE THAT I HAD NEARLY UNANIMOUSLY WERE BORROWERS ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING ACTUALLY TRYING TO MAKE GOOD ON THEIR DEATH -- AND WHEN THEY REACHED OUT -- TO THEIR STUDENT LOAN COMPANY THEY GOT. NO INFORMATION CONFLICTING INFORMATION OR DOWNRIGHT WRONG INFORMATION. AND I THINK WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT THESE BORROWERS. HAVE AN AVENUE FOR RECOURSE FOR MISTAKES THAT COULD COST THEM LITERALLY HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- NOT BECAUSE THEY DID ANYTHING WRONG THEY TOOK ON THE DEBT WE ASK THEM TO THEY ENTERED FIELDS THAT WE ENCOURAGE THEM -- TO AND WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO SIMPLY GET THE RELIEF IN THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY WERE PROMISED. A VERY LARGE OUT OF STATE COMPANY BECAUSE IT WAS IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST TO DO SO. GAVE THEM BAD INFORMATION. AND I BELIEVE I THINK WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A PATH BY WHICH PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THEIR FINANCIAL LIVES RUINED HAVE SOME RECOURSE TO TRY TO GET SOME JUSTICE. I'M MY QUESTION IS ARE. OBVIOUS -- ALONE SERVICE OF PROVIDERS. ARE LICENSED RIGHT. SO WHEN WE ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF TRYING TO GET THEM LICENSED SO THAT WE HAVE SOME STANDARDS TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. EVEN IF WE CAN DO THAT THERE. NOT EXHIBITING THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO THE THE BORROWERS WHO YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BE THEIR CUSTOMERS. TO HELP THEM MANAGE TO GET OUT OF DEBT THE DECISIONS THAT THEY ARE FACILITATING WITH THEIR BORROWERS KEEP THE BAR WITH AND THAT LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE. PUT THEM INTO FORBEARANCE INSTEAD OF SOLUTIONS FOR GETTING OUT OF THAT THAT JUST KEEP THE INTEREST TAKING UP AND UP AND UP AND UP. SO THERE ARE OPERATING IN THEIR OWN BEST INTEREST NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE BORROWERS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TO FLESH OUT THE LICENSING SYSTEM AND SO FAR MANY OF THESE. STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS ARE NOT COOPERATING WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. AS THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED IS REQUIRES THEM TO DO. AND THEY'RE SORT OF THEIR ESSENTIALLY THUMBING THEIR NOSE SO YES WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE THE BORROW SOME CELLS AND D. A.'S. ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS THE ABILITY TO TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE MALFEASANCE THE INCOMPETENCE THE INCORRECT TREATMENT OF THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. AND GIVE THEM AND THE BAR WAS THEMSELVES THE TOOLS TO REDRESS SOME PRETTY EGREGIOUS WRONGS. OKAY WHY UNDERSTAND THAT THE RIGHT NOW WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOT -- OPERATING. OUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA AS A REQUIREMENT TO BE LICENSED A WE DON'T HAVE A LICENSE FOR THEM TO OPERATE. THAT IS BEING THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING ATTEMPTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING COLLECTING DATA FROM HIS SERVICERS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE COOPERATING SHOULDN'T BE THE FIRST STEP US SO THAT WE CAN -- A DE REGULATE THE IF THE VIOLATE -- WE JUST OF VIOLATIONS SO THEN THEY CAN BE DE LICENSED. NO WE ARE TRYING TO PUT SOME POWER TRYING TO LICENSE THEM WHICH IS APPROPRIATE AND ONCE CALIFORNIA PUT THAT LICENSING PROGRAM A PLACE WITH AT LEAST THE DEVON DOESN'T STATES NOW THAT ARE FOLLOWING SUIT. AND ALL OF THOSE STATES AND MORE ARE WATCHING CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW TO SEE ASKING US TO LEAD THE WAY ON RECREATING SOME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS MOST OF WHAT WE BASS FOR HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT ALL OF THOSE HAVE NOW GONE AWAY. THEY ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT PROVIDING ANY OF THESE PROTECTIONS SO WE NEED TO STEP IT SO LICENSING. THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE THE SORT OF THE TWO FACES OF PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND ONE IS HAVING A LICENSING SCHEME. THAT FACES THE SERVICERS THE REGULATED INDUSTRY AND WORKS WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST JOB THE OTHER THAN WOULD BE CONSUMER FACING THAT'S THIS PIECE. THAT LOOKS TO GIVE TOOLS TO CONSUMERS TO PROTECT THEM AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO REDRESS THE WRONGS THAT ARE HAPPENING SO WE HAVE A LICENSING STRUCTURE WHICH IS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE TO TRY AND HOLD THE SERVICES ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE THEN WE GIVE SPECIFIC RIGHTS. TO THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE GRIEVANCES THAT THEY HAVE WHEN THE LICENSEES IN THIS CASE OR THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY GET LICENSE IN THAT PROGRAM CAN BECOME SUCCESSFUL. THAT THAT STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS THAT ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SENT TO THE THE WHAT WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. UNDER OUR LAWS AND UNDER THE SORT OF FADING FEDERAL STRUCTURE. THIS AMENDMENT STONE ARE YOU OF TEARING THAT BE A LICENSING THAT THAT IS ONE STATE THAT'S CURRENTLY THE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES I I DID CARE THAT BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO. OKAY WAS THE STATUS. IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED CURRENTLY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IT HAS GONE INTO EFFECT YET. IT HAS GONE INTO EFFECT OKAY IF THAT'S THE CASE -- THEN -- WHEN THEY VIOLATE THE? LICENSING BODY WE HAVE -- THAT WAS MY FEARS OBVIOUSLY -- CAN NOT JUST TO TAKE AWAY THEIR LICENSE SAID. RATHER THAN TELLING. ALL IT THIS IS OUR LIKE -- ENCOURAGING PREVIOUS LAWSUITS -- NOT FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BY ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION THIS IS HIM POWERING STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGED. TO BE ABLE. TO TAKE GET REDRESS FOR HOW THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG. THE WITHOUT THE DISPUTE PEOPLE CAN ALSO WITH THEM NOW I THOUGHT THAT THEY CAN SUE FOR ANY REASON. IF THIS OBVIOUS MISTAKE COMMISSION SAID THEY WOULD SUE -- POTENTIALLY BUT THAT'S THAT'S A BIT NEBULOUS WHAT WE'RE DOING BY THIS BILL IS CREATING THE FRAMEWORK OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY AND CREATING A STUDENT LOAN ADVOCATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. A BROAD LOOK AT A A POINT. FOR STUDENT BORROWERS TO COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ASK QUESTIONS GET CORRECT INFORMATION AND BE INFORMED OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU A AND RIVER SAM. FOR BAUER-KAHAN YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW. LIAM IT'S GOING TO SOUND OLD WHEN I SAY THIS BUT IT IS ASTONISHING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH TODAY. IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN WHEN I GRADUATED. AND THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN A LOT OF CASES ARE MAKING MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THE LEAST WE CAN DO FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IS PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS WHEN THEY WANT TO AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER STONE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. I WANT TO MAKE A ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK -- OFTENTIMES WE DON'T SPEND TIME OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. AND THEY THINK THEY'RE VULNERABLE AND THEY ARE VULNERABLE TO ANYBODY WHO COMES ALONG AND AND THEY FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHAT THEY GET THIS IS WHAT THEY GET. AND OFTENTIMES IS A HIGH LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AMONG PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES GET SOME FAIRNESS AND SOME JUSTICE IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND SO. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS BECOME BIG BUSINESS WE KNOW THERE. ARE MUCH MORE THAN WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL AS I SAID I GOT EVERYTHING FOR TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY WROTE HIM A CHECK AND THANK THEM -- BUT YOU KNOW NEXT. OF WITH THREE DEGREES YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT FROM UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT WAS IN AN ERA WHEN PEOPLE BELIEVED IN AND STUDENTS AND BELIEVE THAT -- WE SHOULD ONLY. HAVE AS MUCH DEBT OR OF GRANTS AND LOANS THAT WAS REQUIRED AND AND WHEN OUR FEES WERE REASONABLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATING KIDS IN CALIFORNIA WAS RESPONSIBILITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE BENEFIT FROM THOSE FOLKS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL AND GOT THESE DEGREES MY FEET AND MY CONCERN IS THAT AS I LISTEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE OR THAT WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF JUST. YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STREETS THEY'RE BEGINNING TO CALCULATE AND DECIDE TO GOING TO COLLEGE IS NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE IF THEY END UP WITH THE DEBT THAT'S ENORMOUS. THEN THEY CAN'T PAY IT OFF AND SO IT BECOMES A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND THEY LOOK THEIR COLLEAGUES WHO GOING TO COLLEGE WITH THIS DEBT NOW THEY SAY OH LOOK HE'S PAYING ALL THIS DEBT I'M WORKING A JOB DOING WHATEVER I'M DOING. AND I'M DOING BETTER AND SO I THINK THE THE OPTICS OF OF HAVING OUR STUDENTS SO DEEPLY IN DEBT AS A RESULT OF GETTING A COLLEGE DEGREE. IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE. A AND THAT'S IN AND AND THIS IS FROM FROM LOOKING AT AT MY AGE LOOKING AT WHAT COLLEGE DEGREES MEANT TO MY GENERATION AND AND MANY OF YOUR PARENTS GENERATION. THAT WAS REALLY THE THE GOLDEN TICKET TO A TO A TO A BETTER LIFE THAN THOSE WHO DIDN'T GO. AND AND SO AS A RESULT BUT NOW I LISTEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY CALCULATING BECAUSE THEY HAVE FRIENDS WHEN DEBT FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR WHATEVER IT IS AND IT KEEPS ESCALATING IT ESCALATING. AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A WAY OUT OF IT OTHER THAN TO GO INTO DEFAULT AND IN THAT ROLE IN JULY FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO WE KIDS ARE SMART NOW BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE DOESN'T DOESN'T FACTOR OUT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE POOR KID YOU NEED SOMETHING TO GIVE YOU A LEG UP. YOU KNOW YOU NEED THAT DEGREE TO BASICALLY DEFINED AND GIVE YOU SOME PARAMETERS OF YOUR FUTURE AND SO I'M CONCERNED AND I THINK THIS IS GREAT -- THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE DEBT AND SO FORTH BUT WE THERE ARE SOME RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE. AND AND AND THEY SHOULD NEED TO BE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO GIVING LOANS AS TO WHO YOU'RE GIVING IT TO AND AND WHETHER NATURAL OVER. GIVING LOANS TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S A FAIR ISSUE SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT I LOOK AT IT IN THE LARGEST SENSE OF WHAT MESSAGE DO WE SEND CALIFORNIA TO YOUNG PEOPLE. GO TO COLLEGE. IS IT REALLY WORTH IT AND THEY'RE BEGINNING TO TELL ME THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE COST OF IT IS TOO GREAT AND THEIR FRIENDS WHO WENT TO COLLEGE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. AND ON AND ON AND ON SO I THINK WE WANT TO SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE CALIFORNIAN TRADITIONALLY HAS DONE THAT IN TERMS OF MAKING OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SEE ISSUES THAT I UC'S AFFORDABLE. AND SAYING WE HAVE COLLEGE FOR EVERYONE AND THAT COLLEGE REALLY DRIVE CALIFORNIA AND THE INNOVATION AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE HERE SO WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH. THAT THAT SAYS THAT THE IT'S NOT WORTH IT AND THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BECOMING VULNERABLE SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS I APPRECIATE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS GETTING TO THE FLOOR IN PASSING THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND I AGAIN I WANT TO ECHO THE THANKS THAT TO YOU AS A MEMBER STONE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BARS IN THE STATE. THAT TOTALS MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD IS IT WHAT CALIFORNIA BARS NEED THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME RIGHTS AND THAT THOSE RIGHTS IN Q. INCLUDE ACCURATE INFORMATION INCLUDE AN ENTITY. THAT THEY CAN GO TO TO ASK QUESTIONS I THINK BACK TO WHEN I HAD STUDENT LOANS AND READING THE FORMS AND CALLING THAT YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER THAT IS REALLY HARD TO DO. AND I AM SORRY THAT THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT SOME OF THE CONVERSATION INCLUDED JUST ONE ASPECT OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL DOES SO MUCH MORE THAN GIVE SOMEONE THE ABILITY TO SUE. THIS BILL GIVE SOMEONE A RIGHT -- THAT IS BIGGER -- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS IS A BILL THAT IMPACTS MANY A MILLIONS OF HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE STATE -- WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS WHO ARE GRAPPLING WITH LOAN AND DEBT A STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS NOW THE SECOND HIGHEST TYPE OF DEBT IN THIS. STATE. YOU KNOW FOLLOWD BY MORTGAGES AND I THINK THAT -- TO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- I'M GLAD YOU'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK AB. IT'S NEEDED -- AT THIS TIME -- IN OUR STATE AND I AM GLAD THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAKING THE LEAD -- I A ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK -- IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD LOVE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT -- TO I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN FABULOUS TO WORK WITH OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS WE'VE DONE A LICENSING AND THAT ON THIS PROGRAM. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE MALEVOLENCE OF THIS IS. THAT THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS GO TO THEIR STUDENTS SERVICER TO TRY AND GET INFORMATION AND GET LED ASTRAY. THEY END UP AT IN MORE PAYING MORE THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR ON THE OTHER ASPECT WHICH IS UNDERLYING THIS IS WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF THAT DEBT. AND THE CONTINUATION OF OF BRINGING KIDS INTO DEBT BUT IN THE MEANTIME. THIS IS REAL WE CAN DO SOMETHING REAL NOW THAT BENEFITS THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING ALL THIS THAT AND GIVE THEM SOME HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO CLIMB OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THAT DEBT.
