BUT THAT'S OKAY [inaudible] HI. SORRY TO BREAK UP ALL THE CONVERSATION THERE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE SPECIALNESS A RAINY DAY. THAT THE RANGE COULD CONTINUE FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER LOOKS LIKE -- BUT WITH THE TODAY ARE A JOINT HEARING WITH THE SENATE HEALTH THAT SIMPLY HEALTH AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH TODAY. A LITTLE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TODAY IS THE FIRST HEARING IN THIS ON THIS SUBJECT THIS IS A MEANT TO BE AS AS BACKGROUND. AND THEN -- NEXT THURSDAY NEXT TUESDAY WHAT DAY WAS THAT WEDNESDAY I'M SORRY NEXT WEDNESDAY -- WE WILL HAVE A SECOND HEARING ON THIS ON THIS SAYS -- AND LOOKING AT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND HOW THINGS HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. IT'S WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A COUPLE OPENING -- COMMENTS I MADE A PASS AT OUT THEN I'LL PASS IT TO A DOCTOR PAN AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE SO -- MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AFFECT A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE UNITED STATES AND ESPECIALLY COMMON AMONG LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. MEDI CAL PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN COPA COVERING MENTAL HEALTH CARE. MIDDLE HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM AND MEDI CAL IS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH -- BENEFIT DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HEAR HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. HOW THEY'RE ADMINISTERED OTHER FINANCED AND HOW QUALITY IS MEASURED AND INSURED? THIS HEARING WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS -- THAT FRONT AND FOR A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN -- I LIKE TO PASS A DOCTOR PAN WOULD YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR WOULDN'T I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER ABOUT THIS ONE AND ALSO TO THE FOR THIS. FOLLOW OPEN AS WELL AS SCHEDULED THE NEXT WEEK -- NUMBER THE MEDI CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM ITSELF IS COMPLEX AND CERTAINLY I GETS MORE COMPLICATED WHEN YOU ADD IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. I KNOW TODAY I THINK WE'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THE VARIOUS -- DOLLY FUNDING STREAMS BUT ALSO DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M HEARING FROM MEMBERS OF MY OWN -- HOUSE -- IS THAT IN THE SENATE IS THAT -- THERE'S A GREAT DESIRE -- TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SUBSTANCE -- YOU SERVICES AS WELL WE HAVE THAT HOPE YOU A CRISIS GOING ON AND WE KNOW OUR WE'RE DEALING WITH -- HOMELESSNESS FOR IT WELL IT'S NOT ALL. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE SERVICES WERE TALKING ABOUT AS CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEING SURE PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY NEED -- AFTER THAT -- IN TERMS OF REHABILITATION AND AFTER THE LEAVE US. THE JAILS ARE PRISONS UNFORTUNATELY OFTEN IT TOO MANY LOCALITIES THE JAIL IS THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IN IN IN THAT WITH CALORIE. AND SO THIS INTERSECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO CERTAINLY IT'S OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE DOING OUR HOW WE ARE. HOW MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WORKS HOUSE BE FINANCE AND ALSO HOW WE HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE -- THAT AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SO CERTAINLY SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEVEL COUNT ABILITY ABOUT HOW THE ONLY FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT BUT SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED. SO I APPRECIATE THAT TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING THAT BACKGROUND OF HOW THIS IS SET UP AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND ASSURE THAT -- THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT -- WE CAN ACTUALLY ESTABLISH A STATE PRIORITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS THE THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING THIS HERE FROM THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR BEING PRESS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PENS OR ANY OF THE OTHER OF OUR COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY REMARKS MISS RODRIGUEZ YOUR I JUST WANNA. BOB WE'RE GONNA BE. THERE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE YOU KNOW WHAT THE **** LÃ  MIND OF ROMANOV WHICH IS HEARING. IS A YEAR AGO THEY RESPOND OR THE RISK LA COUNTY OR WHATEVER MEMORIES. OF WE HAVE TO USE FOR THE CALL BACK TO THE SITE WATER INDICATIONS AND WE WERE TRANSPORT THOSE PATIENTS. INSTEAD OF TO THE HOSPITAL SETTING TO THE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY NEEDED TO BE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW OUR COUNTY JAILS ARE OVER BURDENED WITH A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS NOT TO MENTION -- PROBABLY ANY EMERGENCY ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S PROBABLY. A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THE PATIENTS IN THERE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE'RE DELIVERING SERVICE. WE NEED TO FIND OUT BETTER WAYS LIKE I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WENT AWAY AND GOT RID OF THOSE TYPE OF TEAMS ARE OUT THERE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT OF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO BRING THOSE BACK. I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY WE CAN HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THIS CONGESTION AND ISSUES THAT WE SEE IN OUR HOSPITALS AND FORTY OR COUNTY JAIL SYSTEMS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FOR FOR THE DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SO WE HAVE FOUR PANELS TODAY AND AND SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS AFTER EACH PANEL WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS -- THAT'S OKAY -- OUR FIRST PRESENTER -- CATHERINE TEAR. PLEASE COME ON UP. CATHERINE IS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HIGH VALUE CARE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FROM FROM CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. FOR HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN WOULD CHAIRMAN PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. HAPPY TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION TO OFFER SOME HIGH LEVEL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON PREVALENCE. OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND ACCESS TO CARE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IS A NONPROFIT INDEPENDENT PHILANTHROPY WITH OFFICES HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND WE'RE DEDICATED TO ADVANCING MEANINGFUL MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM SERVES THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOME AND FOR WHOM THE STATUS QUO IS NOT PROVIDING GOOD SERVICE. I'M GOING TO MOVE. FAIRLY QUICKLY OF THROUGH THE SLIDES BUT I WANTED FIRST TO SAY A WORD ABOUT MY SOURCES. MOST OF THE INFORMATION -- THAT I'M GOING TO PROVIDE TODAY CAN BE FOUND IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA FOR TOO MANY CARE NOT THERE WHICH IS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS ALMANAC PUBLICATIONS. THAT WE PUBLISHED ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND THOSE COMPILE THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE DATE ON DIFFERENT TOPICS TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE STATUS OF HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE. DATA IN THE ALMANAC COME FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES FEDERAL DATA LIKE THE CENSUS -- FROM THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH STRAIGHT XIN STATE PROGRAMMATIC DATA FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFSHE POT AND OTHERS. MUCH OF THE DATA THAT WE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR'S FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN IT IS STILL THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE THEN MOST NOTABLY THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL -- AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES IN OUR ENFORCEMENT OF PARITY LAWS AND OTHER THINGS OF THAT IS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND. I ALSO WANT TO OFFER A FEW PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM A RECENT STATEWIDE POLL THAT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IN THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION -- PUBLISHED IN JANUARY WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASKED WHAT DO YOU MOST WANT THE NEW GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO WORK ON WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE. THE TOP RESPONSE WAS MAKING SURE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS CAN GET TREATMENT. SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THESE IMPORTANT HEARINGS AT THIS TIME. AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SIDE I'M GOING TO TALK FIRST ABOUT PREVALENCE THAN ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MEDI CAL. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE IN TWENTY FOUR ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ABOUT 4% OF ALL ADULTS EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT'S DEFINED IS A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER RESULTING IN FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT THAT INTERFERES WITH OUR LIMITS MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES. A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE ABOUT ONE IN SIX OR 15% OF THE CALIFORNIA DEL POPULATION EXPERIENCED ANY MENTAL ILLNESS AGAIN. THEY HAVE A MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER THE REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT. AMONG CHILDREN THOSE WITH THE GREEN FIGURES. ONE IN THIRTEEN MORE THAN 7% HAD A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT OF THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS FOR ADULTS. THERE IS NOT AN EQUIVALENT ANY MENTAL ILLNESS -- CATEGORIZATION FOR CHILDREN SO THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. FOR THE MOST PART AND YOU'LL HEAR ME SAY THIS A FEW MORE TO OVERALL ESTIMATES ARE NOT. ARE NOT REALLY AT ALL CHANGED FROM THE LAST TIME THAT THE CALIFORNIA FOUND CARE HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION RAN THE STATE A WHICH WAS BASED ON TWO THOUSAND NINE DATA SO OVERALL WE ARE SEEING. CONSISTENT LEVELS OF PREVALENCE WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM MAJOR CHRONIC ILLNESSES. HOWEVER THE RATES DO VERY ACROSS THE STATE IN A COUPLE OF WAYS FIRST BY REGION THE RATE OF SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AMONG CHILDREN THOSE ARE THE GREEN BARS. VARIES FROM A HIGH OF EIGHT POINT 1% SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY DOWN TO A LOW OF SEVEN POINT 1% IN THE BAY AREA. FOR ADULTS THAT'S THE ORANGE BARS THERE'S A RANGE FROM ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT IN THE NORTHERN IN SIERRA REGION DOWN TO THREE AND A HALF PERCENT IN THE GREATER BAY AREA SO THERE IS. A IT IS A DIFFERENCE IN FOR A QUICK NOTE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS REPORT NORTHERN AND SIERRA WHICH WILL COME BACK TO AGAIN IS ONE REGION. IT INCLUDES THE COUNTIES NORTH OF SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS THE EASTERN SIERRA COUNTIES DOWN TO THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SLIDE BUT AMONG ADULTS CALIFORNIA WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO EXPERIENCE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT FOUR POINT 8% VERSUS A THREE POINT 6% FOR MEN AND AGAIN. THESE RATES ARE LARGELY UNCHANGED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS SLIDE SHOWS VARIATION BY RACE AND ETHNICITY CHILDREN ON THE LEFT ADULTS ON THE RIGHT CHILDREN WE DON'T SEE A TREMENDOUS -- DIFFERENCE BY RACE AND ETHNICITY THERE IS SOME WE SEE GREATER VARIABILITY IN THE RATES OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WITH NATIVE AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND MULTI RACIAL ADULTS. EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST RATES ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS WITH THE LOWEST RATES OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND ONCE AGAIN WE SAW THE SAME DISCREPANCIES IN TWO THOUSAND NINE SO NOT MUCH CHANGE -- CHAIR WOULD MENTIONED PREVALENCE VARYING BY INCOME IT'S VERY TRUE WE DO SEE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF THE LOWEST INCOME LEVELS. FOR CHILDREN THE GREEN BARS YOU CAN SEE THAT ONE IN TEN CHILDREN BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL SUFFERED FROM A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. THE ORANGE BARS SHOW ALMOST AS MANY ADULTS ABOUT 9% OF PEOPLE BELOW A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL EXPERIENCING SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. I'VE SAID THE PREVALENCE RATES OVERALL ARE UNCHANGED I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE EXCEPTION. THE RATES OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODES IN ADOLESCENTS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN POINT 2% OF TEENS REPORTED EXPERIENCING A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN THIS I WANT TO BE CLEAR IS NOT. THE NORMAL ADJUSTMENTS OF ADOLESCENCE AND MOODINESS ILLNESS -- BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT RATE IS UP TO TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT SO SORRY TWELVE POINT 3% IN CALIFORNIA. OF ONE IN EIGHT ADOLESCENCE WHICH IS A 50% INCREASE OVER THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE'VE SEEN THESE NUMBERS INCREASING NATIONALLY AS WELL -- AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS AREA OF CONCERN I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS IS FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE THAN THE OTHER PREVALENT SLIDE SO THEY MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE THIS IS FROM SAMPSON REPORTING. ALTHOUGH OUR HEARING TODAY'S FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE I THINK ALL AWARE THAT VERY FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS HAVE CO OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND THAT'S WHAT'S REPRESENTED HERE ON THE SLIDE THESE STATISTICS SHOW THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF ADULTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ALSO HAVE A DIAGNOSED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. FOR YOUTH THAT NUMBER IS ABOUT MOST PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ARE NOT SUICIDAL. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO DIE BY SUICIDE DO HAVE A MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER AN ESTIMATED THIRTY TO UP 270% EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION OR BIPOLAR ILLNESS. AND ON THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE PEOPLE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ABOUT SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAN THOSE WITHOUT. SO SUICIDE STATISTICS ARE QUITE RELEVANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH THEY REPRESENT OBVIOUSLY THE EXTREME EDGE SORT OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. CALIFORNIA SUICIDE RATE WHICH IS BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE HAS BEEN STABLE FOR A LONG TIME THE NUMBERS DON'T CHANGE MUCH. IT'S LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE -- WHICH IS NOT SHOWN HERE. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE RATES ARE NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IN PARTICULAR ON THE VERY CONSIDERABLY BY REGION LA COUNTY HAS THE LOWEST RATE AT SEVEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THE NORTHERN SIERRA REGION IS THREE TIMES AS HIGH AND DOUBLE THE STATE AVERAGE. SUICIDE RATES ALSO VERY BY GENDER. AND BY RACE AND RACE AND ETHNICITY. MALES HAVE THREE TIMES THE RATE OF SUICIDE OF WOMEN ALTHOUGH IT THIS ISN'T ON THE SLIDE AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS YOU SEE MUCH HIGHER RATES -- SELF REPORTED ATTEMPTS OF SUICIDE ARE MUCH ARE TWICE AS HIGH AMONG GIRLS AS AMONG BOYS -- RATES OF SUICIDE ARE HIGHEST BY ETHNICITY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN AND WHITE GROUPS. THAT'S OF THOUGH THERE'S THE BLUE BARS ON THE SLIDE. I'M NOT GONNA SHIFTED TO TALK TO A TOPIC I KNOW IS OF UTMOST INTEREST EVERYONE HERE WHICH IS ACCESS TO CARE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS. AND I WILL SAY THAT THE NUMBERS ARE NOT GREAT -- THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE JUST OVER A THIRD OF CALIFORNIAN AND ADULTS WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS RECEIVED TREATMENT OR COUNSELING DURING THE PRIOR YEAR. AND THIS IS A COMPETENT OF DATA FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT'S NOT A SINGLE YEAR BUT REPORTING BACK IS A SELF REPORT BASED ON THE PAST YEAR. THIS IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE WHICH IS ABOUT 43% AND AGAIN IS THE SAME AS IT WAS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING CARE WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE POLL RESULTS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH FOUND THAT ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT QUOTE. MOST CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE YOU SERVICES ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEM. AND ONE THING WE FOUND IN THAT POLL WAS THAT OF HE REPORTED% THAT THEY WENT OUT TO TRY AND SEEK TREATMENT. THEY WERE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO SAY THAT IT'S HARD TO GET SO THIS IS A PERCEPTION -- IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IT'S BORNE OUT BY PEOPLE'S ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SLIDE BUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE I WILL SAY THAT FOR ADULTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION AGAIN THIS SLIDE IS FOR PEOPLE WITH ANY MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT FOR PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION ADULTS THE NUMBERS ARE REVERSED AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DO REPORT GETTING TREATMENT SO THAT'S GOOD -- AS YOU KNOW DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND STRONGLY ASSOCIATED NOT ONLY WITH SUICIDE BUT ALSO WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH -- LESS PROMISING THOUGH WE SEE -- THE SAME NUMBERS THESE ARE FOR ADOLESCENTS SO I MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE THIS INCREASED RATE OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AS WE'VE SEEN. AND ONLY ONE THIRD OF THOSE CALIFORNIA ADOLESCENTS WHO REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODES DURING THE PAST YEAR HAD RECEIVED TREATMENT -- AND THAT IT CAN IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE WHERE STILL LOW BUT IT'S CLOSER 240% THAN THE 32% WE SEE HERE. MYCO PRESENTERS ARE GOING TO SAY A WHOLE LOT MORE AND A LOT MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS OF CARE BUT I WANTED TO GET A FEW POINTS IN. THE FIRST IS THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE ALL HEALTH BUDGET. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH BUDGETS NO THESE ARE U. S. THIS IS U. S. STATUS OF THIS IS REALLY AT A HIGH LEVEL WE DON'T HAVE SIMILAR DATA FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT I FIRST WANTED TO POINT OUT THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE SPEND HERE. TOTAL U. S. MENTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES THIS IS FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN WERE PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT 6% OF THE TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES FOR THE NATION SO -- I TRIED TO MAKE THE SLIDE WITH AS BUT THEN YOU COULDN'T READ THE LITTLE ONE SO THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE BUT REALLY ONE IS REALLY 6% OF THE OTHER. THE SECOND POINT IS THAT MUCH MORE THAN OTHER KINDS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH PUBLIC PROGRAMS -- IN THE CIRCLE ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THAT MEDICAID AND SO CALLED OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT WOULD INCLUDE FEDERAL GRANTS -- ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCES. ARE PROJECT WERE PROJECTED TO PLAY IT PAID FOR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF MENTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES AGAIN THIS WAS -- FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE SEE ON THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SIDE SO -- THIS IS A PUBLIC SYSTEM MORE THAN OUR OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS EVEN MORE THAN OUR OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. AND THIS IS AGAIN A VERY HIGH LEVEL SLIDE SHOWING THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES WHO ARE SERVED BY THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IN MEDI CAL WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW IS RUN BY THE COUNTIES NO HERE MUCH MORE ABOUT IN A BIT. WELL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO -- THE ON THE BAR TO THE LEFT OF THAT SYSTEM WAS FAIRLY EVENLY SPLIT SPLIT BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH MEDI CAL EXPANSION THE NUMBER OF ADULTS BEING SERVED HAS REALLY SOARED. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IS INCREASED BY ABOUT 17% ADULT NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED ALMOST 50%. NOW MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED ALREADY THROUGH OTHER MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING SOURCES. BUT THEY'RE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL AND ALL OF ITS BENEFITS AND THE SHIFT MEANS -- THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE SIR I HAVE HAD ACCESS TO BEFORE EITHER. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL. TREMENDOUS DISPARITY IN HOW LONG PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AS WELL. LIVE IN THE SOCIETY AGAIN THESE ARE NATIONAL NOT CALIFORNIA STATISTICS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE AMERICANS WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIE TWENTY FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT. THE NUMBER FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ACTUALLY SORRY IT'S A DUBBED DRUG DEPENDENCE DIAGNOSIS IS ACTUALLY HOW THAT STUDY WAS DONE -- DIED ALMOST TWENTY THREE YEARS EARLIER AND IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE ARE DYING NOT OF OVERDOSES OR SUICIDE OR ACCIDENTS BUT RATHER THE SAME THINGS AS THE REST OF THE POPULATION ONLY A LOT YOUNGER HEART DISEASE. STROKE DIABETES AND RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS SO ONE THING THAT WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IN LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM IS HOW PEOPLE CAN RECEIVE BETTER INTEGRATED CARE PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WE SEE THESE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES REFLECTED IN OUR SPENDING THIS IS BACK TO MEN MEDI CAL DATA THIS IS FROM -- TWENTY ELEVEN YOU CAN SEE THE TOTAL COSTS OF CARE FOR A PERSON WITH DIABETES ALONE IS SORT OF ON THE IS ON THE LEFT HAND BAR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE BAR THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS DIABETES AND ALSO HAS SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES AND THE COSTS ARE TWICE AS HIGH MORE THAN DOUBLE AND FINALLY THE BAR ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS A PERSON WHO HAS DIABETES AND IS ALSO? A HAS SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS AND AN S. U. D. DIAGNOSIS AND AGAIN THE COST UP TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES AS HIGH. WHAT I WOULD NOTE HERE IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE THERE IS IN THAT YELLOW BAR WHICH IS OTHER MEDICAL CARE IT'S NOT? MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BAR BLUE BAR AT THE TOP IT'S IN THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND ALSO IN THE OTHER MEDICAL CARE THAT WE SEE THE DIFFERENCE. SO AGAIN THIS SUGGESTS THE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE INTEGRATE CARE WE ARE ACCRUING COSTS ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE NOT JUST ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. IN CLOSING I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE THESE DATA AS A WHOLE DO SHOW CONTINUING GAPS IN ACCESS TO CARE. AND RISING RATES OF ILLNESS FOR SOME POPULATIONS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN WITH MENTAL ILLNESS DO RECOVER. THEY WORK AND VOTE AND RAISE FAMILIES AND PARTICIPATE FULLY IN OUR SOCIETY AND PROVIDERS OF CARE ALL OVER THE STATE ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE AND ARRANGE TOP OF THE LINE CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. AGAIN THE POLL RESULTS I THINK A REALLY INSTRUCTIVE HERE ABOUT COUNSELING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN HELPING PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CAN MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. LEAD HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THOUGH THAT OUR SYSTEMS MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS ALL THE CARE THAT WE NEED AND THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER AND DO MORE. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME TODAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION IS SERVED WITH QUESTIONS FROM PANEL [inaudible] MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU I'M JUST BRIEFLY WHEN YOU WERE SHOWING THE YOU KNOW THE RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN IT WAS KIND OF STARK IN LEE -- INTERESTING HOW HIGH THE RATES ARE IN THE CHILDREN THAT ARE OF OF COMING -- DOES THAT INCLUDE THE SEPT FIGURE INCLUDE -- AUTISM SPECTRUM AS WELL DESIGN INCLUDED IN THE MENTAL ILLNESS PORTION OR I SHOULD CHECK THAT TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE I DON'T THINK IT DOES I THINK THAT DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE AUTISM ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME OVERLAP BUT I WILL CHECK AND GET BACK TO THEM. MINE I'M ARE THERE OTHER THAN I ALSO -- I KNOW IN THE LAST YEAR SO WE'VE LOOKED INTO YOU KNOW THE ACQUIRED STRESS OF YOU KNOW CHILDREN NOW GROWING UP -- FORGET THE ACRONYM THAT SEES FOUR ACES YES YEAH -- I WOULD ASSUME. THAT THAT'S IN A ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I MEAN TO THE AS FAR AS THE THE DATA -- HAVE THE BROKEN IT DOWN YOU KNOW TO MAYBE THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE REGIONS ARE THAT WAY I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE URBAN CITIES ACTUALLY DOING BETTER THAN THE RURAL. YEAH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE -- COME FROM SORT OF A GOOD A COMPLEX ANALYSIS DONE BY CHARLES HOLZER AND LONG NGUYEN IS THE SAME DATE OF ITS STATE IS USED IN THE PAST THEY DON'T ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP SO I HESITATE TO EXACTLY ON ON THE Y. FOR IT -- BUT IT'S TRUE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION -- CERTAINLY BY INCOME AND I THINK THAT. IT'S NOT NOT A LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT THAT'S IN SOME WAYS RELATED -- TO TO THE STRESSES OF POVERTY. OKAY AND THEN JUST LAST REALLY QUICKLY -- BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COSTS THE OVERALL COST OF THE THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW MONIES AND AND THE THE COST OF THE TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. WE KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND PEOPLE NEED TO STAY IN THEIR TREATMENTS -- WOULD THE EXTRA COSTS LIKE. THE IT THE S. U. D. TREATMENTS OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH OR SOCIAL BESIDES THE PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH WOULD THAT BE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON TOP. OF THE COSTS THAT WAS SHOWN OR IS THAT INCLUDED IN THAT. AS OF RIGHT IS THIS IN THE MEDI CAL DATA OR IN THAT GLOBAL DATA IN THE GLOBAL. THE GLOBAL DATA REALLY JUST BREAKS DOWN THE OVERALL HEALTH SPENDING AND MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING BY SOURCES BUT IT'S VERY HIGH LEVELS SO -- I THINK THERE'S I I DON'T CONSIDER TO BE EXTREMELY PRECISE BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. INFORMATION ON SO THAT WOULD BE. IF YOU ADDED THAT IN IT WOULD BE MORE THAN THE 6% OF HELL OVER OF OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING THANK YOU IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE ENORMOUS -- OBSTACLES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU SHE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- FEW QUESTIONS HAVE FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PREVALENCE DATA -- FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ADULTS SPIED RECENT DATA SOURCE FOR US I HAVE A CHANCE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE BUT FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THERE'S TREMENDOUS STIGMA -- NON THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE API COMMUNITY SO I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE THE LOW LEVEL OF ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND AMONG ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SO LOW IS THAT ACTUALLY REALITY OR IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE REPORTING ARE NOT REPORTING -- SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I CAN COMMENT ON A TWO POINT OF OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD THE SAME QUESTION THE THAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU -- SEPARATELY A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR THESE -- RATES THEY'RE BASED ON A SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC RISK MODEL SO THEY'RE NOT SELF REPORT OR SURVEY SO THEY PROBABLY DON'T LIKE THEY DON'T -- THEY ARE AFFECTED. BY IMMEDIATE STIGMA OF PEOPLE NOT DISCLOSING A SURVEY FOR INSTANCE. BUT I AM. I IMAGINE THEY ARE THEY THE UNDERLYING MODEL IS BASED TO SOME YES SO -- I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON EXACTLY HOW THAT BY A SHOWS UP BUT OKAY WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT STIGMA DOES AFFECT. IN GENERAL IS A CHALLENGE IN GETTING TRUE REPORTS BOTH IN SELF REPORTED DATA. AND IN -- THESE DEMOGRAPHIC MORRIS WELL AND ALSO I MEAN IT'S NOTJUST SELF REPORT IT'S IF YOU'RE BASING ON ARE YOU SEEKING SERVICES. AND ALL THAT FACTORS IN RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN SEE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT THAT'S GOING ON A FAMILY MEMBERS WILL PRESSURE THEM NOT -- TO THE OTHER QUESTION I GUESS AND I KNOW THAT -- SUMMER WALDRON BROUGHT THIS UP AND AND TERMS OF THIS TRANSITION FROM CHILDREN BEING AROUND 7% AND AND ADULTS -- YEAH I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW MUCH -- HOW MANY LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES GET CAUGHT UP AT IN WHEN YOU SAY BECAUSE -- IN THAT DEFINITION ABOUT -- THEIR EMOTIONAL -- BECAUSE WHAT WHAT'S THAT GETS UP BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE -- SOME OF THE MORE I GUESS WELL RECOGNIZED -- MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA SO FOR ACTUALLY IN ADOLESCENCE SO WHEN WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THAT TRADITION WHY IS WIRED ADULTS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN. KIDS WHEN WE ACTUALLY KNOW A LOT OF MENTAL ILLNESSES. ACTUALLY COME AND ADOLESCENCE OR YOUNG ADULTHOOD SO. THAT SEEMS LOW COUNTER INTUITIVE AND I THINK IT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH DEFINITIONS. I THINK IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH DEFINITIONS AND AND IS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS ARE NOT THE SAME I MEAN THESE ARE. THESE ARE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS -- IN THE IN THE DSM -- I WOULD OFFER A MINUTE. I I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE COUNTIES MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK -- WELL TO HOW THAT TRANSIT I SEE A AND ADULTS BUT KNOW YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN OBVIOUSLY THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DOES DEVELOP AS PEOPLE GET OLDER SO YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY. IF THE DEFINITIONS WERE THE SAME YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE THAT DROP OFF BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS. FOR OKAY -- THE OTHER QUESTION TERMS A SUICIDE RATES -- I SEND IS THAT COMPLETED SUICIDE DIVERSES SUICIDALITY BECAUSE ONE COULD ARGUE THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE NO RATES OF DEPRESSION ARE HIGHER AMONG WOMEN BUT MEN MAY USE MORE VIOLENT MEANS OF ATTEMPTING SUICIDE THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE IT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S PERHAPS PART OF THE REASON WE SEE SOME OF THE VARIATION AND ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS. ANYTHING TO DO ALSO WITH THE REGIONAL VARIATION AS WELL IF IT LOOKING AT SO IT OUTSIDE RATE IS IT IT IS IT'S WHAT SUICIDALITY COMPARED TO COMPLETION OF SUICIDE. YEAH THOSE THOSE TWO SLIDES THAT SHOWED SUICIDE RATES BY REGION AND BY GENDER AND ETHNICITY WORK COMPLETED SUICIDE SUICIDALITY YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. IS IT IS A DIFFERENT THING A BIGGER AND IT DOES HAVE THOSE -- THOSE DIFFERENTIALS IN TERMS OF GENDER SO -- PARTICULARLY TEENAGERS GIRLS MORE LAW ASIDE BOYS MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE CITIES. OKAY. WE CAN WE WON'T GET INTO MEANS WE CAN. ENGAGE IN TO TRY TO REDUCE ACTION COMPLETION. AS WELL AS PREVENTION OF SUICIDALITY AND FINALLY -- IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING -- FOR EXAMPLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH I MADE REFERENCE MY INTRODUCTION MARX IS THIS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE RESOURCES USED. BY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SO WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR JAILS ARE OFTEN ARE MAJOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS COURSE PEOPLE WONDER INCARCERATED DON'T GET MEDI CAL -- REINCORPORATE IN THAT SPENDING AS WELL INTO THIS GRAPH OR IS THIS MAINLY LOOKING AT REIMBURSEMENT -- FOR SERVICES AND COMMUNITY. YET THE THE VERY HIGH LEVEL -- NATIONAL CHARTS THAT JUST SHOW THE OVERALL HEALTH SPENDING BUDGET THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING BUDGET ARE REALLY PULLED FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO WOULD NOT INCLUDE OTHER. OTHER SOURCES THAT MIGHT BE SPENDING ON ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUTSIDE JUST MAKE NOTE THAT PUBLIC SPEND ON MENTAL HEALTH IS MUCH LARGER THAN WE MAY BE SEEING HERE MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT THAT CERTAINLY I KNOW. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SPENDS A LOT OF NOT ONLY EFFORT OF MENTAL HEALTH ACTUALLY PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR PRISONS AND JAILS AND SO. MAYBE WE SHOULD AS WE THINK ABOUT WATER APPROACHES ARE AND WHAT MUCH WERE. CURRENTLY SPENDING HOW MUCH WE SHOULD BE SPENDING WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING NOW THANK YOU IT'S COUPLE QUESTIONS IN PERSONAL THINK AGAIN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR OF YOUR REPORT IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING AND BUT ALSO VERY SOBERING IN MANY WAYS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- JUMPS OUT AT ME REPRESENTING A BIG PART OR CALIFORNIA AS THE HIGH NUMBER OF SUICIDE THAT HIGH SUICIDE RATE THERE -- AND THEY'RE TO THOSE DID THOSE VERY BY AGE CHUBBY OBVIOUSLY BE SAW IN EUROPE IN THE SUBSEQUENT CHARTER SAW -- YOU KNOW ETHNICITY AND BUT WE DIDN'T. DO THEY ARE YOU SEEN. FOR EXAMPLE THE MAN WHO. YEAH. COMMIT SUICIDE. IS THERE AN EIGHT WE HAVE AGE DATE ON THAT AND AND WHAT WHAT WE SEEN WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS BECAUSE IT IS. IT IS TWICE THE STATE AVERAGE YEAH -- THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IN THOSE DATA ARE AND I'M JUST GONNA CHECK FROM THE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION I BELIEVE BUT I WANT TO DO A QUICK CHECK ON THAT -- IBM THE COME BACK AND CHECK ON THAT -- WE DO SEE VARIATION BY AGE WE DO NOT HAVE DATA THAT CROSS REFERENCES -- THAT THE DOES ACROSS THE REGION IN AGE FOR INSTANCE OR REGION AND GENDER SO I'M NOT SURE I CAN DIG DOWN TOO MUCH FURTHER WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT -- AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN WHAT OTHER DATA WE CAN PULL THAT GIVES MORE OF A MORE OF A PICTURE FOR THE NORTHERN SIERRA REGION IN PARTICULAR. I GUESS -- LIKE I DID DID YOU BEGIN TO WONDER I THINK WE STRUGGLE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH PROVIDERS -- IN GENERAL -- AND I LOOK AT YOUR DATA IN GENERAL THE FOR IT ENJOY A CROP ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE WHO WHO. ARE UP THERE RECOGNIZES NEEDING CARE OR GETTING AT I DO WONDER HOW THAT RICK HOW THAT. RATE GOES FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OF I KNOW FROM MY AND OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE NORTH THE NORTH PART OF STATE IT'S IT'S HARD GETTING PROVIDERS IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE SO -- YOU BASED A LOT OF DATA WAS BASED ON TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN NUMBERS. ANY IDEA WHAT WHAT THE TRENDS ARE WITHOUT. YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR OUT ON A LIMB -- WHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE TRENDS GOING? I THINK. BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN PAST VERSIONS OF THIS I THINK THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF ILLNESS I THINK IS PRETTY STATIC AND AGAIN. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SURPRISING IS -- MENTAL ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CHRONIC ILLNESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US AND I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT IS IT IT. IS THAT IT WILL GO AWAY NOR -- SHOULD THAT BE OUR GOAL -- I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD I HOPE -- WITH THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL AND GIVING PEOPLE MORE ACCESS TO SERVICES. I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AND HOPE TO SEE INCREASED RATES OF TREATMENT INCREASED RATES OF ACCESS TO CARE FOR PEOPLE BUT I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. AND I THINK THAT'S A MY COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW UP ON ADDITIONAL PANELS WILL MAY HAVE MORE OF RECENT DATA FROM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATIONS WORKFORCE COMMISSION. TALKED ABOUT -- IT HAD A WHOLE A GROUP THE SUBGROUP WORKING ON ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IN THE WORK FORCE PERSPECTIVE AND THERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF OF A PROVIDERS AND SO PART OF THE STRATEGY IS OBVIOUSLY TO GET MORE PROVIDERS AND IN THE COMMUNITIES. YEAH THERE'S NO QUESTION OTHER WASN'T WASN'T TIME TODAY TO ADD IN THE WHOLE WORKFORCE PEACE BUT I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU RAISE IT BECAUSE IT IS. A VERY REAL CHALLENGE ACROSS THE STATE -- PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS -- WHERE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MATCH PEOPLE -- TO AN ADEQUATE NUMBER PROVIDERS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH ARENA SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AS WELL. IT'S A REALLY IT REALLY IS A A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY. C. NOT APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHO HAD TO BRING UP OUR SECOND PANEL -- JENNIFER AND AND DID FOR CAN AND AMY MILLER SO WE WILL THIS PANEL WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF MEDIC -- MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED AND HOW CARE IS DELIVERED. OUR TWO SPEAKERS -- JENNIFER CAN'T -- DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN AMY MILLER WHO WAS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR OF MONTEREY COUNTY -- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DIRECTOR CAN. I SEE SLIDES COMING UP I'M JUST KIDDING AS I TRAVEL LATELY I DON'T BRING SLIDES -- SO GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN -- DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE -- AND FAMILIAR WITH OUR DEPARTMENT -- IN THE HIGHEST -- OVERVIEW I LIKE SIX DELIVERY SYSTEM SO TODAY WERE OBVIOUSLY -- LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WE ADMINISTER AS A STATE DEPARTMENT BUT WE HAVE FEE FOR SERVICE MANAGE CARE MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DELIVERY AND THAT BREAKS DOWN AND TO THE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING AN ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM VERSUS -- COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL IN A STATE PLAN STD MODEL -- CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM AND THEN DENTAL SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BENEFICIARIES THROUGH THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA WHICH CURRENTLY STANDS AT ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION. BENEFICIARIES -- THEY CAN TOUCH ONE IF NOT ALL SIX OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS INCLUDING OTHERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY SUCH AS I JUST US OR THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THROUGH -- DDS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- MENTAL HEALTH IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL -- ITEMS THAT KIND OF BOTH GUIDE OUR WORK AS WELL AS KIND OF SET THE FOUNDATIONAL -- ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF FINANCING IN OVERSIGHT SO WE OPERATE -- ARE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THROUGH AND NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER THIS IS A WAIVER THAT IS ALLOWED. TO US THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ESSENTIALLY AND SHORTHAND FORM IT ALLOWS FOR THE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A COUNTY ORGANIZED SYSTEM FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IN DOING SO THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CONTRACT WITH -- TO RECIPIENT COUNTY CONTRACTED NETWORK -- AS OPPOSED TO HAVING BASICALLY IT ANY ACCESS AS A AS IS TRADITIONALLY ALLOWED UNDER MEDI CAL -- ARE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM SO OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR CONTRACTING PLANS -- THEY OPERATE THROUGH AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AUTHORITY AND SO WHAT YOU SAW IT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ARE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN DELIVERING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR BOTH PEDIATRIC IN A BOOK DON'T POPULATION SINCE THE MID NINETIES -- WHEN WE ALLOWED FOR THE -- ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND THE INCREASED -- CAPACITY FOR BENEFICIARIES TO HAVE MILD TO MODERATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ALLOWED FOR THE TWENTY FOUR CONTRACTING MANAGED CARE PLANS TO OFFER THE COURT I SAID QUOTE UNQUOTE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT BECAUSE I THINK WE WOULD ALL ARGUE THAT. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT EASY TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE WITH A MILE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE AS OPPOSED TO A MODERATE AND THEN ONCE YOU GO FROM MODERATE. TO SERIOUS IT ACTUALLY IS -- REALLY HAS HALF AS WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT PROVIDE THE BULK OF MEDICAL SERVICES TO ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION BENEFICIARIES IN THE STATE. AND THEY INTERACT WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS OF WHICH THERE'S FIFTY SIX NOT -- FIFTY EIGHT I'LL LET YOU GUESS WHICH COUNTIES HAVE CONSOLIDATED PLANS BUT THERE'S ONLY FIFTY SIX OF THEM -- AND THERE ARE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING SO THAT YOU WILL HAVE A RECIPIENT PERHAPS WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS -- SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA -- AND I WILL USE THE COUNTY OF MONTEREY AS AN EXAMPLE -- IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND MONTEREY THEY THE COUNTY WILL BE PROVIDING THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THAT BENEFICIARY BUT THE REST OF THE CARE WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OVERALL PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SO. THE COUNTY AND THE PLAN HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO COORDINATE THAT CARE -- AND THEN. ALL OF THIS IS FINANCED THROUGH AND I KNOW THAT THE AGENDA -- TALKS ABOUT IT A LITTE BIT AND I KNOW THAT THE ELIA WILL SPEAK TO THIS IN THE SECOND PANEL OR THE NEXT PANEL -- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FUN SOURCES THAT HELP GUIDE THIS WORK THAT IS DELIVERED BETWEEN BOTH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. THERE ARE -- TWO KINDS OF REALIGNMENTS FUN FUNDS THERE ARE -- THERE THEN THERE'S OTHER COUNTY GENERAL FUND -- I LIKE TO SAY THAT COUNTIES -- WHEN SERVING THESE -- BENEFICIARIES THEY CAN USE WHAT WE CALL BRAIDED FUNDING WHICH MEANS YOU CAN HAVE. YOU CAN BILL MEDI CAL FOR CERTAIN SERVICES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ANNA AND COVERED UNDER THE STATE PLAN THEN THERE'S OTHER SERVICES THAT YOU MAY WANT TO PROVIDED THAT BENEFICIARY. IN WHICH THEY CAN USE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING WHICH IS MORE FUNGIBLE AND MORE FLEXIBLE YOU CAN USE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING YOU CAN USE COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS IF THE PERSON STAINED AND INSTITUTE FOR MENTAL DISEASE AND THOSE ARE NOT. CAPABLE THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITY -- I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AREAS OF OUR PROGRAM THAT WE ADMINISTER BETWEEN US AND THE COUNTIES -- SO THE OVERSIGHT -- THE MECHANICS THE FINANCING THE CLAIMING -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES AND THEN -- VICE VERSA -- WE ALSO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE MANAGED CARE WATER IT -- TO ALSO BIG POPULATION RULES THAT I WOULD -- REMIND THIS COMMITTEE OF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION AND THE ADULT POPULATION AS IT PERTAINS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO UNDER ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS -- DOES A REALLY NICE JOB OF TRYING TO BREAK IT OUT -- IT PRETTY SIMPLISTIC MANNER IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC DISEASES THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE DO TWO EPS D. T. THESE. AND THE SCOPE OF WHAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS MUCH BROADER THE STANDARDS ARE MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AND THEN ONE AN INDIVIDUAL. BECOMES AN ADULT AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THE CRITERIA FOR BOTH THE SERVICES PROVIDED AS WELL AS THE FLEXIBILITY CHANGES -- FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY AND SO I WOULD -- ARGUE THAT THAT IS ALSO A VERY SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT WAS. RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND WE WERE WHISPERING -- ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL IN TERMS OF THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL FIRST HAS -- AS A SCHIZOPHRENIC -- BEHAVIOR PATTERN -- EPISODE IS USUALLY AROUND THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN IRONICALLY AND IN SOME CASES -- TRAGICALLY THAT IS KIND OF AT THE END OF YOUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES UNDER THE EPS D. T. TYPE OF SCHEME AS OPPOSED TO GOING INTO AN ADULT SO -- I'M HAPPY -- TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF STRESS TO IN TERMS OF DATA AND I KNOW THAT -- WE PROVIDED THIS TO THE COMMITTEE AND ARE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AS WELL IS THAT SINCE WE INSTITUTED THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE UTILIZATION ACROSS THE PLANS -- AND HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH YOUTH AND ADULT -- TAKE UP RATES AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE GETTING CARE THROUGH THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE -- BENEFIT WE STARTED IN THE FIRST YEAR TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WITH ONLY TWELVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX CHILDREN -- THAT HAS GROWN TO THE LAST YEAR AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN. ON THE ADULT SIDE IT STARTED AROUND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS USING THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT AND NOW WE'RE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND SO IN THE COURSE OF THE YEARS SINCE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND INSTITUTED THAT BENEFIT -- WE HAVE SEEN A GROWING AMOUNT OF UTILIZATION OF THOSE SERVICES WHICH WE THINK IS ACTUALLY -- A VERY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE RECEIVING CARE THROUGH THE SHORT DOYLE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- SYSTEM HAS REMAINED FAIRLY STEADY AND STATIC AND SO THAT CERTAINLY SUPPORTS THE DATA REFERENCE BY C. H. C. F.. BUT WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING IS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING SERVICES IN BOTH AREAS SO THERE IS A SMALL AND GROWING NUMBER OF POPULATION THAT IS NOT ONLY GETTING SERVICES AND THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH. AREA BUT THEY'RE ALSO GETTING CARE FROM THEM MANAGED CARE PLAN SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING BOTH SIDES OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHICH WE ALSO THINK IS BOTH ENCOURAGING AND POSITIVE. SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND HAPPILY US INTO QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END PANEL OKAY THANKS PLEASE DOCTOR. SO I'M AMY MILLER THE DIRECTOR BEAVER HEALTH MONTEREY COUNTY AND THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF CV HDA. SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND I THINK I WANT TO SAY BEFORE I START TALKING ABOUT ALL OF OUR COMPLEXITY I THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS VERY BRIGHT. YOU KNOW PARTNERING WITH DH CS TO LOOK AT SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR WAIVER AND REDUCE THIS COMPLEXITY. SO WE CAN YOU KNOW BETTER SERVE THE BENEFITS AND FUNDING NOT NECESSARILY GO UP. SOME OF THIS IS ALREADY IT SAID BUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS OVERALL WORK CARVE OUT SO WE'RE CONSIDERED A PREPAID INPATIENT HEALTH PLAN. OUR FIRST OBLIGATION IS COVERING ALL IN PATIENT COSTS -- SO WE OPERATE A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS YOU GUYS ARE ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT NETWORK ADEQUACY AND CERTAINLY WE SEE -- IN MORE URBAN COUNTIES WE SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING WITH CONTRACTED PROVIDERS THAT THAT REALLY THRIVE BUT IN RURAL COUNTIES. MANY OF THE COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE YOU KNOW SOLELY COUNTY STAFF MEMBERS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. SO THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF DIVERSITY IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO RESPONSE TO THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY. THIS IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT GRAPHICS SO DIRECTOR CAN'T ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT OUR WORLD IS KIND OF COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE'RE SORT OF A SPECTRUM MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO COUNTIES HAVE YOU KNOW THE PURPLE IN THE LIGHT I MEAN EXCUSE ME THE ORANGE IN THE LIGHTER ORANGE WITH -- THE MODERATE AND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE DISORDERS VERY VERY SEVERE DEPRESSION BIPOLAR SCHIZOPHRENIA. WE DO NOT HAVE THE MILD MODERATE -- BUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH IS KIND OF CONFUSING BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO SAY WHAT IS MILD MODERATE VERSUS SEVERE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE AN A. ONE C. SCORE YOU GET AN EXACT NUMBER. AND YOU CAN SAY THAT PERSON'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE EXACTLY THIS WAY WE SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT WITH BENEFICIARIES THEIR NEEDS CHANGING. AND CERTAINLY IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SERVE THEM WELL CONTINUE ON WE SEE PEOPLE BECOMING MORE SEVERE. AND UTILIZING CRISIS SERVICES WHICH IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO SEE PEOPLE WE WANT TO COMING INTO OUR OPEN ACCESS STORES. YOUR CLINICS ARE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS NOT TO EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE INTERACTING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. ALSO COUNTIES -- HAD PREVENTION FUNDS THROUGH AND WE JUST SAY DOLLARS THAT PROVIDE QUITE A BIT A ROBUST PROGRAMMING. THIS IS MY ONE OF MY BEST EFFORTS TO DESCRIBE HOW COMPLICATED OUR FUNDING IS. SO EACH PERSON THAT WE SERVE HAS A DIFFERENT EIGHT CODE AND EIGHT CO DETERMINES HOW MUCH FEDERAL FINANCING YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL DOWN. SO LIKE THE PERSON IN JAIL WE DO SOME JAIL SERVICES AS YOUNG CLINICIAN I USED TO GO TO THE JAIL AND DO ASSESSMENTS TRY TO HELP PEOPLE LIAISON OUT THAT WOULD NOT BE A CLEAN MOBILE SERVICE ABOUT BE SOMETHING THE COUNTY WOULD DO. IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THERE'D BE ZERO DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT USING REALIGNMENT OR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES -- BUT EACH PERSON HAS -- IF THEIR NEWLY ELIGIBLE THAT HIGHER EIGHT CODE IF YOU'RE UNDOCUMENTED THAT'S THE PERSON ON THE AND THAT'S 0% SO WHEN WE'RE SERVING AND DOCUMENTED -- WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH OUR REALIGNMENT FUNDING SO IT'S KIND OF A COMPLEX RUBRIC AS A BUSINESS PERSON THERAPIST CONVERTED TO BUSINESS PERSON I USED TO BE YOUNG THERAPIST NOW RUN THE SYSTEM. NO IT'S IT'S HERE. WHO'S THE PERSON ON THE FAR LEFT IS THAT THE DATA DOESN'T GIVE ME SERVICES YEAH SO YOU KNOW IF. SOMETIMES I MEAN ACA'S REALLY HELPED US OUT TO THE GROWTH THAT YOU SEEN WITH A CA BASED ON POVERTY BUT WHEN I WAS STARTING IN THE SYSTEM SO OFTEN YOU'D SEE PEOPLE WHERE THE FATHER WOULD NEVER BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. YEAH SO EASY IS A BIG GAME CHANGER FOR US SO YOU HAVE A MOTHER ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SHE'S A MOTHER TO BE A HAVE A HIGHER AID CODE AND THE DAD WOULD GET NOTHING. AND THEN CLEANING FOR THOSE FAMILY SERVICES ON OUR CURRENT BILLING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE VERY VERY COMPLEX -- SO YOU'LL OFTEN SEE COUNTY IS DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE THE CLIENT WITHIN WHILE FOLLOWING ALL RULES ESTABLISHED BY JENNIFER CAM. FOR FIND IT DIFFICULT BEING NEXT YEAR BOX. AND THEN ONE OF THE OTHER KEY THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT. IS SO ARE FUNDING RUBRICS WE USE ALL THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES -- TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDING. SO -- WE LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. REALIGNMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ONE POINT THREE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT ONE POINT THREE WERE USING THOSE DIFFERENT LOCAL SOURCES TO PULL AS MUCH FEDERAL MONEY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR IN A COUNTY WITH HIGH POVERTY RATE. ALMOST HALF MY POPULATIONS ON MEDI CAL I CONSIDER ALMOST A MORAL OBLIGATION TO POINT AS MUCH FEDERAL FINANCING AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE -- BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT FEDERAL FINANCING YOU CAN'T REALLY EXPANDED PROVIDE SERVICES WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN DEMANDS FOR SERVICES INCREASE. THE GOING BACK TO RUNNING A WEIRD BUSINESS IN OUR WORLD ECONOMY GOES DOWN SAR FUNDING GOES DOWN BUT DEMAND GOES UP. SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT BEEN FUN. VERY VERY COMPLEX FUNDING FOR US. WE LOOK AT WHAT WE DOING A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ALREADY MATURE DOING UP. ASSESSMENTS AND PREVENTION SERVICES WE'RE DOING A LOT OF COUNSELING THROUGH AND I JUST SAY WERE DOING WHAT ARE CALLED FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT THE WHATEVER IT TAKES MODEL. THE PROVIDES A VERY VERY INTENSIVE SERVICE LEVEL XIN PEOPLE MENTION SOME OF THE MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR COMMUNITY BASED -- SYMBOLS DOING ASSESSMENTS AND EMERGENCY ROOM. COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS COVER ALL INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES AND THEN WE ALSO DO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES SO IN MY COUNTY I HAVE QUITE AN EXTENSIVE. MEMBER SIDE OF BENEFICIARIES IN STATE HOSPITALS ARE I AM D. PLACEMENTS WERE YOU YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO PULL IN FEDERAL FUNDING FUNDING FOR THAT. SUCH ALL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THAT'S MY VERY HIGH AND BENEFICIARIES THEY CAN'T SAFELY BE IN THE COMMUNITY AT A LOWER LEVEL OF KERR. SO IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE SERVICE LINE THE COUNTIES MANAGE WE MANAGE THAT RISK -- THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR CHILDREN'S I THINK THAT COMMITTEE WAS ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE PREVALENCE RATE FOR KIDS VERSES ADULTS. THE SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE OPEN RESPIRE FOR TO BE VERY OPEN FOR CHILDREN. SO EXAMPLE IN MY COUNTY WE ASSESS A 100% OF FOSTER KIDS KIDS THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO FOSTER CARE. YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS MORE PREVENTION PERSPECTIVES WE KNOW IF WE DELAY ACCESS TO CARE VERY EASY FOR YOU KNOW SYMPTOMS TO EMERGE LATER ON IN THE KID FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS OF THE EPS D. T. CRITERIA. IS PRETTY GENEROUS IN ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. NOTE BEAT TO EXTENT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE ASTRA -- SO IN IN OUR CHILDREN SERVICES THERE'S A LOT OF SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON AND COUNTIES THAT YOU WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW IS US. SO OFTEN YOU'LL HAVE SCHOOL BASED THERAPIST THEIR COUNTY EMPLOYEES THAT WHERE SCHOOL BADGES THEIR BILLING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH MEDI CAL BUT THEY'RE REALLY TRANSPARENT TO THE POPULATION IN TERMS OF WHO'S FUNDING THEN WHY THEY'RE THERE. WE ALSO DO LIKE I MENTIONED A LOT OF PARTNERSHIP WITH SOCIAL SERVICES -- IT A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THE JUVENILE JUSTICE POPULATION BOTH PREVENTION AND YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT THEIR SERVICES TO KIDS. AND THEN MANY COUNTIES HAVE A LOT OF INNOVATION TRANSITION AGE YOU SERVICES AND SERVICES SPECIFICALLY TO LGBT Q. YOU NEED CAR MORE FLEXIBILITY AND WEBER PROVIDING SERVICES -- ANY JUST A IT'S BEEN SO ESSENTIAL FOR US THIS COUNTY IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF US ARE RUNNING IS SORT OF CONSUMER RUN WELLNESS CENTER SO OPEN ACCESS CLINICS THAT'S NOT A MEDI CAL BENEFIT THAT'S MORE THROUGH AN HSA BUT THIS KIND OF IS THE RUN. DOWN OF DIFFERENT SORTS OF SERVICES ANOTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT WE PAY -- FOR IS WE PAY FOR BOARDING CARE PATCHES. SO WHEN A CLIENT LIVES IN A BOARDING CARE THAT THAT. SO PERSONAL SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT TAKES UP MOST OF THEIR SS I CHECKS ON AVERAGE CLIENT WOULD GET ABOUT TEN DOLLARS A WEEK LEFT OVER -- THE REST IS GOING TO THE BOARD AND CARE AND EVEN THAT IS NOT FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE FOR BORDEN CARES. SO WE OFTEN PATCH ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY JUST SO THE BOARDING CARE CAN KIND OF MAKE ENDS MEET SO THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT FRANKLY WOULD BE HOMELESS IF WE WERE USING OUR REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AGAIN NOT SOMETHING BILLABLE TO MEDI CAL. TO KEEP THEM SAFELY HOUSED IN THE COMMUNITY. SO JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WE'RE DOING -- SO WE ALSO PAY FOR STATE HOUSE THIS IS ACTUALLY YOLO COUNTY GRAPHIC I THINK IT'S A REALLY GREAT WAY TO EXPLAIN -- SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS OVERALL. YOU'LL SEE -- YOU'LL COUNTY IS THREE CLIENTS IN THE STATE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TOTAL SPENDING FOR THREE PEOPLE. VERSUS PREVENTION THEY'RE SERVING TEN THOUSAND CLIENTS HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DOLLARS PER PERSON THIS IS SOMETHING WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH WE DON'T WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE THIS RIGHT WE LOVE TO RE DIRECT MORE DOLLARS TO PREVENTION. MORE DOLLARS TO BUY SHORT TERM CARE -- BUT WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY COMPLEX CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE THE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL THERE'S REALLY NOT ANOTHER OPTION FOR US -- AND I THINK I WANNA SAY THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR. YOU KNOW I GET BY ONLY UP WITH MY FRIENDS AND SO PARTNERING WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS PARTNERING WITH DSS. PARTNERING WITH PROBATION AND ALSO PARKING WITH PRIMARY CARE THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION HAPPENING A LOCAL COUNTY IS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTEGRATION SOME PEOPLE PLACING. THERAPISTS IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS OTHER PEOPLE DOING REVERSE INTEGRATION I'VE OPENED A CLINIC WHERE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS SO JENNIFER'S EXAMPLE THE PERSON WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WHERE CCH WOULD BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. FOR THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES I'VE BUILT A REVERSE INTEGRATION CLINIC SO THEY CAN GET THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS MET IN A BEHAVIOR HEALTH CLINICS WE SAW THE UTILIZATION RATE WAS SO LOW. FOR BENEFICIARIES AND I USE SOME OF MY MONEY TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THE PRODUCTIVITY. IS SO LOW IN THAT PRIMARY CARE SETTING THEY'RE NOT BE ABLE TO RUN THROUGH TWENTY CLIENTS. A DAY IS MORE LIKE IT TEN CLIENT THE DAY YOU KNOW TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE -- ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF LIFE LOSS FOR PEOPLE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS NOBODY DIES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. YOU DIE OF UNTREATED CANCER UNTREATED HEART DISEASE WE KNOW THE SOLUTION RIGHT IT'S PRETTY ACCESSIBLE CARE BUT FOR PERSONAL SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS THERE SO MANY BARRIERS TO GETTING THEM INTO THAT PRIMARY CARE CLINIC. YOU THERE'S A LOT OF COUNTY INNOVATION HAPPENING TO MAKE THAT. TO MAKE THAT CHANGE -- I THINK WE WANTED TO SAY THAT WHEN PEOPLE ASK HOW DO WE GET INTO YOUR SERVICES SO LIKE I SAID I HAVE MY FRIENDS MY PARTNERS THOSE ARE OPEN DOORS I HAVE STAFF CO LOCATED AT CHILD WELFARE COLOCATED THAT PROBATION -- WE ALSO RUN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR ACCESS LINE AND THEN OPEN CLINICS SO IN MY COUNTY MY REGIONAL CLINICS WE ALSO HAVE WALK IN HOURS SO PEOPLE CAN CALL FOR APPOINTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY JUST WALK AND WE FOUND THAT REALLY HELPFUL TO HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF OUR HEALTHEQUITY GOALS. WHERE THE LATINO POPULATION WHICH IS STARKLY UNDERSERVED IN CALIFORNIA IT'S BEEN MORE OPEN TO THE WALK IN CLINIC TYPE MODEL? I KINDA WENT OVER THAT THE WORK WE'RE SORT OF ALL OVER THE PLACE NOW QUESTION. VERY GOOD -- I KNOW CENTER MORNING TO HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CO CHAIRS FOR ORGANIZING THIS AND I WANT TO THINK DIRECTOR CAN'T FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DEPARTMENT DOES AND WELCOME DOCTOR MILLER WHO. PREVENTS AMAZING SERVICES AND THE COUNTY I REPRESENT MONTEREY COUNTY -- IT REALLY IS A PATCHWORK IN I THINK. PRESSES POLICYMAKERS. IT'S SO HARD TO LEARN THE ALPHABET SOUP AND WERE YOU GONNA FOR FAMILIES CAN BE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING. SO THANK YOU -- FOR THE SERVICE -- THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING. I THINK IN NEAR -- CATEGORIZATION OF ALLIES -- AND OTHERS ALSO NONPROFIT SECTOR THAT YEAH IS HELPING -- THE MARIN COUNTY TRANSPORTATION -- PROVIDE SOME SPECIALTY SERVICES ALSO FOR THE THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY. ON THIS MAY BE DRAWING DOWN TOO FAR BUT I'VE. LEARNED FROM CONSTITUENTS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT THEIR MEDICATION REFILLS -- ON A THIRTY DAY CYCLE. IN THIS SOMETIMES OF THE POPULATION FOR WHOM IT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO GET TO THE PHARMACY. TO REFILL STANDARD PRESCRIPTIONS. THAT THEY'RE REFILLING EVERY MONTH AND THERE'S NOT A LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE. CURED FIFTEEN DAYS INTO A THIRTY DAY PRESCRIPTION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE DIRECTOR CAN'T KNOW IS THAT IS MY INFORMATION ACCURATE. MAYBE SOMETHING YOU COULD LOOK INTO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE AT YOUR FINGER TIPS BUT I KNOW. IN THE PLANS THAT MANY OF US ARE UNDER WE CAN DO MAIL ORDER NINETY DAY PRESCRIPTIONS. DINO SEARCH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH HE'S GETTING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS THURMOND ACCOUNT IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION -- IN SO WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT IT MAY BE THAT -- THE PROVIDERS ONLY WRITING IN THIRTY DAYS SCRIPT SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO TITRATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MEDICATION IS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE THEY COULD BE WRITING IT IN CERTAIN AMOUNTS AND THEN -- WE ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE PHARMACY ON THE MEDICAL SIDE AND SO IT DEPENDS ON THE DRUG AND DEPENDING ON THE UTILIZATION CONTROLS THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT PARTICULAR SCRIPTS WE MAY HAVE WE MADE BECAUSE WE MIGHT HAVE TO FILL OUT TIRES EACH THIRTY DAYS. TO YEAH IT DOESN'T DRIVELIKE I KNOW THAT WE PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION -- TO THE COMMITTEE AROUND THE CAR ABOUT BECAUSE WE PAY FOR ALL OF THE ANTI PSYCHOTICS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE -- PHARMACY BENEFIT AND WE SPEND -- FOR ABOUT FORTY CARVED OUT. DRUGS -- IT'S OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND SO SOME OF THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS WE PROBABLY ONLY ALLOCATING THIRTY DAY INCREMENTS BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK YOU ON THAT. AND APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN. NINE I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR A A PHYSICIAN A TREATING PSYCHIATRIST IF THEY'RE ADJUSTING CORRECT RESTRICTIONS NOT WANTING TO PRESCRIBE. BEYOND MAYBE EVEN A WEEK'S WORTH OR WHATEVER. BUT FOR SOMEBODY'S ON A STANDARD. REFILL -- EIGHT IT DOES JUST PROVIDE A PARTICULAR HARD TO GET TO THE PHARMACY. IN MANY NOT ONLY -- DEALING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITY THAT OTHER PHYSICAL DISABILITY SO AND WE DO HAVE MAIL ORDER AVAILABLE TO SO IT MAY JUST BE THAT WE NEED. TO BETTER -- MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BENEFITS AVAILABLE. THAT BE GREAT IF WE COULD LEARN SOME MORE ABOUT THAT IN AGAIN I DON'T HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AGAINST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP IN. THIS IS A FRONTIER UNFORTUNATELY THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN FROM THE EARLIER SLIDES. BEING CONTINUED GROWTH I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE HAS A GOOD. UNDERSTANDING OF WHY OUR SOCIETY IS PRODUCING. SO MANY CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS -- MOVING FROM MILD TO MODERATE TO SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. SOME OF THE EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE AT LEAST IN EFFORT TO TRY -- TO REACH FAMILIES SOME PARTICULAR FORMER BOSS SOMETHING CAN MAYBE BE MANAGED IN NOT NOT MANIFEST INTO A GREATER CHALLENGE BUT AGAIN THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO HELLO -- I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE SLIDE THAT SENATOR LEAVE UP I HAD A QUESTION ON THE ONE WITH THE FAMILIES AND THE LITTLE BECAUSE THE LITTLE HUMANS -- THE THE FAMILY UNIT -- MALE FEMALE CHILD. ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN A FAMILY UNIT. RECEIVE CARE BUT THE MALE OR THE FATHER. DOES NOT. YEAH BUT INDIVIDUALLY AS A MALE HE CAN RECEIVE CARE IT'S REALLY ALL BASED OUR WHOLE WORLD IS MEDI CAL EIGHT CODES SO MEDI CAL EIGHT CODES ARE WHEN PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR MEDI CAL IF THEIR NEWLY ELIGIBLE UNDER THE ACA THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH REIMBURSEMENT RATE BUT THAT'S REALLY. ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF POVERTY AND THEN THEIR ABILITY TO RENEW MEDI CAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RENEW EVERY YEAR. AND SO WE OFTEN SEE YOU KNOW PEOPLE NOT RESPONDING TO THE PAPER WORK AND GETTING IT RENEWED AND WE SEE CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY SO SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE IN BEHAVIOR HOW SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON SO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE WEIRD GOVERNMENT FORMS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN A WEIRD GOVERNMENT. FOR A POLISH KNOWLEDGE SAY THAT AND YOU. ALL GOVERNMENT FORMS ARE WONDERFUL FOR SHORT -- BUT THEN WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME FEAR RIGHT SO WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A DECLINE MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT SOMEWHAT LOCALLY WITH PEOPLE BEING AFRAID BECAUSE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT FOR AND UNDOCUMENTED FAMILY THAT'S THE ONLY WAY SIR THEIR FAMILIES KNOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SO WE'VE SEEN. A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOME PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THAT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFICULT CAL. SO THE COMPLEX WORLD WHEN I HAVE PEOPLE IN HUMANS WALKING INTO MY CLINIC. AND ABOVE THEM IS DIFFERENT NEEDS IN DIFFERENT AID CODES AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT ALL RECONCILE AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HEAR US TALK ABOUT PAYMENT REFORM IN OUR PASSION FOR THAT. WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND USE YOU KNOW THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE I REDUCING A LOT OF THE PAPERWORK BURDEN AND POTENTIALLY SERVING UP MANY MORE BENEFICIARIES. IT IF I IF I MAY IT JUST BRINGS UP -- ADDITIONAL STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THAT HAVE IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN WHICH THE IN ORDER FOR A MOTHER OR A CHILD TO RECEIVE AID. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MEDICAL OR OTHER TYPES OF SERVICE. THE THE FATHER HAS OFTEN BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THAT FORMULA. AND HAS CREATED A A SYSTEM. THAT -- IS NOT HELPFUL TO FAMILIES AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW WE FIX IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILY UNIT ITSELF IS ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE ONE AND I MIGHT. I MIGHT JUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT -- BECAUSE THIS IS. A HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND NOT ON MEDICAL ELEGY WE THERE'S MIXED FAMILIES SO -- WE HAVE MORE GENEROUS ELIGIBILITY IN INCOME STANDARDS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO DEPENDING ON YOUR STATUS YOU MAY BE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT OTHERWISE IF YOU ARE SINGLE YOU WOULDN'T BE -- SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY FAMILIES IN WHICH THE BILL BOTH PARENTS COULD BE WORKING BUT BECAUSE THE MOTHER'S PREGNANT SHE CAN HAVE LESS INCOME SHE CAN HAVE MORE INCOME THAN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD BECAUSE OF HER PREGNANCY STATUS THAT WE WOULD PUT HER INTO MEDI CAL. THE FATHER MAY BE EARNING JUST ENOUGH THAT HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE I'LL SO HE'S MAYBE COVER TO COVER CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WE OURSELVES BLEND -- I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY BASED ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CRITERIA YOU WOULD HAVE. AN ADULT'S LIKE THE FATHER COULD BE -- MILDLY DEPRESSED AND HE WOULDN'T MEET THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA IN WHICH THE COUNTY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AT ALL THAT WOULD FALL TO THE PLANT'S RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN A MANAGED CARE PLAN EITHER THROUGH. MEDI CAL OR THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA AND SO THIS IS WHERE IT REALLY DOES GET -- VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT I THINK YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE IS IS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE MADE -- ALMOST FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL THAT WERE OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND SO THE EXPANSION. AND USE OF SERVICES NOT ONLY IN THE MANAGED CARE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE THEY WERE REFERENCE BUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES OVERALL HAVE CERTAINLY CHANGED THIS DYNAMIC QUITE A BIT BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS -- DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE IMITATION STATUS -- ONE PARENT MAY HAVE A HIGHER INCOME BUT BECAUSE OF THE PREGNANCY STATUS WE MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE I'M STRADDLING BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND OTHER COVERAGE SO I CAN EXAMPLE OF INNOVATION THAT WE DO TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN IN MY EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM SOME OF THE SERVICES MIGHT BE BUILT. TO THE CHILD'S BUT THEY ARE CALLED COLLATERAL SERVICES WERE YOU'RE HELPING THE WHOLE FAMILY. SO WE DO THAT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO REALLY HELP KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO WITH AND ARE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE. THERE ARE SLIGHT WORKAROUNDS THAT ARE THE OKAY THANKYOU AND I APOLOGIZE I THINK SOME OF US IN THE SENATE HAVE TO RUN OUT FOR TRAINING THAT'S MANDATE IS -- TO SHORTLY -- SO FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT -- TO ANDMADE THAT -- DOCTOR CAN'T THAT YOU SAID THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE THE INCREASE THAT THERE'S NOW WHAT AFFECTS ME SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND MILD TO MODERATE CHILDREN TO BE SERVED BY MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE IS THAT CORRECT -- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE GETTING MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES -- THEY MAY ALSO -- BE USING SERVICES IN THE SHORT DOYLE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE PST T. BENEFIT BUT WE HAVE SEEN THE UTILIZATION INCREASE FROM. LIKE I SAID AS THAT'S ADULTS TO GET MY THOUGHTS OUT OF THE WAY IT STARTED AT TWELVE THOUSAND IT'S I JUST MAKE NOTE I APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE INCREASE AND THAT THAT'S GOOD -- THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IF YOU JUST ATTACKED THE NAPKIN CALCULATION WE HAVE NINE POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN -- WE WERE JUST PERCENT OF DATA THAT SAYS THAT IT'S PROBABLY ABOVE SEVEN POINT 3% HAVE SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. AND YOU DO THE MATH THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN. NOW OBVIOUSLY NOT ALL OF OUR MILD MODERATE THERE'S THESE MORE SEVERE BUT SET UP BUT MY GUESS IS IS THAT -- WE'RE STILL SERVING ONLY A FRACTION OF THE CHILDREN. ERVING. TO BE FAIR THAT'S ONLY IF THAT'S ONLY IN THE MANAGED CARE MODERATE MODERATE THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE GETTING SHORT OIL SERVICES OKAY. AND THAT'S ON THAT'S ADDITIVES THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THE OTHER TO A QUESTION I HAVE THIS AND I REALIZE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL WITH LA -- ONE FINANCING BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE AND THERE AND FINANCING -- YOU DO THE FINANCING SO THE WAY WE FINANCE ON THE MEDICAL SIDE IS -- BASED ON THAT REALIGNMENT DOLLARS HOW ARE THOSE DOLLARS ARE BASICALLY I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT -- OUR IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE -- AT EACH COUNTY RELATED TO THE ACTUAL NEED IN THE COUNTY. OKAY RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE RIGHT SO I MEAN I MEAN I REALIZE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS REALIGNMENT OF WATER YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE DOWN A WATERFALL RIGHT YOU KNOW IS THE SPOT TO SPOT. BUT WE DO HAVE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE FUNDING AND COUNTIES AND THE NECESSARY TO DEMAND RIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW THAT. HOW THE MONEY THE KIND OF FALLS DOWN YOU COULD HAVE EITHER MORE OR LESS? IF WE THE CHALLENGE OF BEING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER IS IF WE DO REALLY REALLY WELL IF WE SO IT'S GOT A DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP I KEEP A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL I'M SPENDING MORE MY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ON THAT POPULATION. AND LIKE YOU ALREADY ARTICULATED YOU KNOW THE JAIL SPENDING IS TOTALLY SEPARATE SO IT'S A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IS COUNTY SYSTEM THAT THE FUNDING DOESN'T AT ALL MATCH. YOU KNOW THE INCREASE IN POPULATION AND THE NEED TO AND THAT IS WILL TALK ABOUT LATER WITH PERFORMANCE METRICS. YOU KNOW TWENTY NEW PEOPLE WALK THROUGH THE DOOR AND WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT SO WHEN DEMAND INCREASES WE JUST HAVE TO TRY TO INNOVATE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BEST WE CAN. YOU KNOW AS RESPOND TO NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS. SIMPLE THING SAY IT'S HOW COMPLEX TO DO BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE TO DISPARITIES ARE RIGHT WHERE I THINK YOU KNOW A LOT OF COUNTIES I CAN SAY VERY SPECIFICALLY MY COUNTY I'M STRUGGLING IS THE INCREASED COSTS OF LIKE THE AYE INDIAN STATE HOSPITAL. PLACEMENT SO LIKE ONE REALIGNMENT CATEGORY THAT'S FOR THE ADULT POPULATION I GET THIRTEEN MILLION AND I SPENT TWELVE MILLION LAST YEAR ON PLACEMENTS. SOME TRYING TO INNOVATE RIGHT I'VE DEVELOPED A NEW TEAM THAT'S GOING TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THAT LEVEL OF CARE. BUT AS WE SEE THAT WE'RE KEEPING PEOPLE ALIVE LONGER THEY'RE GETTING INTO VERY VERY EXPENSIVE PLACEMENTS AND BECAUSE THEY ONCE HAD A MENTAL ILLNESS. THEY'RE ENDING UP COSTING A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHEN NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE TO MENTION OTHER PROBLEMS BUT IF I WASN'T PAYING FOR THAT. THOSE PEOPLE WOULD LITERALLY BE HOMELESS OKAY SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT RIGHT WE NEED TO AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SOME VERY EXPENSIVE. STAND EXACTLY HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE A BUFFER AGAINST THAT VARIATION ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER COUNTY THE LESS LIKELY GIVE YOUR AVERAGE THAT OUT. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT IS -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION GOING ON DIFFERENT COUNTIES BUT ALSO YOU KNOW SOME DO BETTER THAN OTHERS -- I APPRECIATE LÃ  THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED BUT AT COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT IN EVERY COUNTY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COUNTY NEEDS ARE SO SO I THINK WE NEED MORE ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT WE WE NEED TO KNOW AT STATE WHAT IS GOING ON IN EACH COUNTY. AND ALSO WE NEED TO BE SURE THE BEST PRACTICES ARE BEING PRACTICED ACROSS THE STATE THAT PEOPLE. ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND THE QUALITY TO CARE SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT COUNTY DO YOU LIVE IN. NOW REALIZE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIFFERENT YEAH THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS BUT AT SOME POINT AND I THINK THERE'S A THAT'S A BIG FRUSTRATION IS IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. DEMANDS NEEDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT WHAT WE CAN'T WE'RE HAVING CHALLENGES IS THAT WE CAN'T -- MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. IN YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE THINGS LIKE THE OPIOID OUT NO PROBLEM. RIGHT IT'S WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE STATEWIDE. WAYS OF ADDRESSING THIS RIGHT -- THERE ARE THINGS YOU KNOW SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WE SHOULD THEIR THIRD VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT -- WELL CERTAINLY I THINK WE WANT TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO COUNTIES BE ABLE TO DO. THINGS THAT ARE MORE TAILORED AT SAME TIME THEY ALSO NEED BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT THEY'RE DELIVERING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICE AND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LEVEL CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. THE ONE CHALLENGE WITH FUNDING THOUGH IS THAT COUNTY IS -- A LOT OF THE BIGGER COUNTIES DO COUNTY GENERAL FUND SO LIKE IN MY COUNTY I GET WHAT'S CALLED THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT WHICH IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED IN ORDER TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. OTHER COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED LIKE SALES TAX -- SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATEO COUNTY THEY'RE GETTING I THINK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THAT ARE ALSO ABLE TO LEVERAGE SOME MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND REALLY GROW TO MEET THE SYSTEMS NEEDS. AND SO SORT OF A LOCAL INVESTMENT MENTAL HEALTH VARIES DRASTICALLY AND KIND OF CHANGES I THINK I DID A PRESENTATION ON SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH I'M ABLE TO INNOVATE IN THE SCHOOL BASED SETTING. FIVE SCHOOL PARTNERS THAT HELP PAY FOR IT ABSENT THAT WOULD REALLY BE STRUGGLING AND SO MANY COUNTIES COME TO ME AND SAY I WANT TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WANT THEIR PERCENT EVERY SCHOOL THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. SO I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF EAGER PARTNERS THAT SEE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE AND HAVE THAT PASSION AND THAT THAT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BE COMMUNITY BASED. IT'S JUST A VERY CHALLENGING FUNDING RUBRIC TO MAKE A LOT OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN YOU KNOW THE WAY COUNTIES ARE. WE ARE AUDITED SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FACT IS OR FISCAL LIABILITIES WE CAN LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BASED ON THINGS THAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO. AND SO THAT ALSO PUTS MANY COUNTIES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE AFRAID TO INNOVATE BASED ON FISCAL RISK. WELL. I THINK -- ACTUALLY SINCE YOUR SETS SITTING NEXT TO DIRECTOR CAT AND I KNOW IN THE BUDGET WE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE A HUNDRED AND WHAT FORTY MILLION OR SOMETHING PANEL FEDERAL PENALTIES. AND WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER. FIGURE OUT HOW WE DON'T AND IF IT. FIRST IN TERMS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS I REALIZE THE CMS IS CAN ALWAYS BE A BIT CHALLENGING AND SO FORTH. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT -- IT REALIZE THERE'S GONNA BE VARIATIONS IN LOCALITIES -- BUT THE AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- AT THERE'S ONLY THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT -- WE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHING STATE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS -- THAT -- COUNTIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR AND THAT -- AND AND THAT OF COURSE THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HELP OUT WITH -- FUNDING AS WELL AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE DO THIS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T WE ALL RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES WE HAVE A PATCHWORK AND THAT MEANS THAT WHAT KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YOU GET DEPENDS ON WHICH COUNTY LIVE ON HOW INNOVATIVE. YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR IS AND AND VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT DOES POLITICAL BOUNDARIES OF THE BEST WAY TO BE TRYING TO DETERMINE -- QUALITY OF CARE AND I REALIZED WILL BE TALKING LATER ABOUT QUALITY CARE. A COUPLE. OF I KNOW THE SENATE. THE START DATE OKAY KNOWS WHAT WELL AND I'M CONCERT YOU GUYS HAVE A TIME CRUNCH SO OVER YOU. OKAY WILL EVEN YOU GUYS ARE YOU OKAY OKAY SENATOR LIMÃ³N THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PRECIADO I WOULD JUST SUBMIT TO ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM THAT AND WE TILL WE CHANGE THE MAIL SLIDE THERE. UNTIL DAD OR BOYFRIEND CAN GET HELP EASILY. HOW DO WE SOLVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS PICTURE BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE WHO COULD BE THE PERPETRATOR SO JUST SUBMIT TO ALL OF US THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AN EASIER WAY TO MAKE SURE DATA BOYS? HAVE A HOUSE SYSTEMS TO MOVE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT BE DOING NOW AND UNFUNDED WAY TOO WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEDERAL WHILE AT LEAST HAVE SOME MORE STATE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST LOOK THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO GET BACK -- TO THE SLIDE NUMBER SEVEN THAT YOU -- WERE PRESENTED TO US ON SOME OF THE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED. AND IN PARTICULAR THE CRISIS INTERVENTION -- COMPONENT THAT'S THERE. I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT -- EMERGENCY ROOMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BEING ENGAGED. BUT AT MONTEREY COUNTY AND AND I GUESS THE WHOLE GENERAL DISCUSSION AS FAR AS CRISIS -- STABILIZATION AREAS -- WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY START TO SEE THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY HAS TRIED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THAT APPROACH? BEFORE IT GETS TO THE MERGER SEE RUBY FORGET MONTEREY COUNTY OR IS A BEEN A DIALOGUE ON MOVING FORWARD ON THOSE TYPES OF CRISIS STABILIZATION -- UNITS WELL AND SO PART OF IT IS IT JUST THE FACILITIES CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS WHICH ARE HOSPITAL LIKE IT'S COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS WHERE THIS CRISIS RESPONSE SO MY CAN I HAVE A MOBILE CRISIS TEAM ASSOCIATED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY COUNTIES HAVE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION IN THAT. SPACE I CAN TELL YOU WE LOSE SO MUCH MONEY ON THOSE. AND NOWHERE NEAR FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE -- IN TERMS OF STAFF COVERING THEIR COSTS THROUGH BILLING CRISIS INTERVENTION IS KIND OF LIKE I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE SO SAID WITH HEALTH AND ON THE THE AMBULANCE SYSTEM STRUGGLES IN THE SAME WAY. HEAR YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE AND TIMELY BUT THEN YOU'RE PAYING PEOPLE WHO YOU CAN'T REALLY OPTIMIZE ALL OF THEIR TIME. SO. I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF COUNTIES MAKES MY VESTMENTS I KNOW LA IS DOING SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE THINGS AROUND MOBILE UNITS THAT ARE FULLY STAFFED INCLUDING CONSUMERS THAT ARE TREMENDOUSLY INNOVATIVE -- SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING A LOT OF PLACES IN THE STATE WERE REALLY COMMITTED TO IT. BUT IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING THING TO SUSTAIN FISCALLY. SO IF -- THE COST UP FRONT IS SOMETHING THAT'S OF CONCERN BUT IN THE LONG TERM IS IT SOMETHING THAT PHYSICALLY. BABY SOUND IF WE LOOKED AT IN A LONG TERM -- YEAH AS FAR AS IT SHORT OF LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS TODAY BUT LOOKING HOW. TACKLING OF THE CRISIS STABILIZATION AREAS NOW AND IN THE LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A BETTER -- OUTCOME CAN BE MORE PREVENTIVE TO A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS THAT ARE THERE. YEAH SO LIKE I'M WORKING ON TRYING TO EXPAND A CHILDREN'S MOBILE CRISIS I WAS DOING THE FISCAL ANALYSIS IT'LL COST AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR ANTICIPATE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND MEDI CAL POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENTS. I'M LOOKING AT A MILLION DOLLAR GAP. RIGHT AND SO I'M GOING TO HEDGE MY BETS CAN I REDUCE CHILD HOSPITALIZATIONS. OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENTS IT'LL BE AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF I CAN SUSTAIN IT. RIGHT. BUT THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT TO HAVE IT AS OPERATING LOSS FOR A LINE ITEM OF BUSINESS IT'S A IT'S A LARGE DOLLAR AMOUNT NOW BUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO QUANTIFY IT. IN THE FUTURE WITH LONG TERM APPROACH TO BE INTERESTED TO SEE SOME OF THAT THOSE -- HAD DATA COMING FORWARD NEXT QUESTION I I HAVE IS -- YOU HAVE WALKING HOURS IN THOSE THINGS AND SO TARGETING -- AND AROUND THE DISCUSSION AGAIN I NOTICED MONTEREY COUNTY BUT THIS IS THE LARGER DISCUSSION. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE HOMELESS YOUTH -- BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE ARE WE STILL KEEPING THAT INSIDE OF SOME OF THE COMPONENT DIALOGUE IT'S THEIR ALSO YES WE DO HAVE HOMELESS OUTREACH PROGRAMS THE HOMELESS YOUTH HAS BEEN PRETTY CHALLENGING TO CAN BE VERY TRANSIENT POPULATION AND THERE'S SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTY IS. ACTUALLY MONTEREY COUNTY HAS A PRETTY SIZEABLE POPULATION OF HOMELESS YOUTH SAN FRANCISCO BUT SOME OF THEM WERE OR RURAL COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT. TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT'S VERY MUCH A SERVICE FOCUS AND THEY'D BE ENTITLED TO A FULL RANGE OF BENEFITS. SO THOSE TWO ARE OR IS IT -- YOU KNOW SENATOR PAT WAS TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LEVERAGING THE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL TO THE STATE TO THE COUNTY -- BUT I JUST WANT TO OPEN UP THE THE DIALOGUE ON ON THOSE TWO SUBJECTS YEAH AND SO IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WORD MAKING A HOMELESS YOUTH PROGRAM THAT WE'RE OFTEN PAYING FOR THE FOOD SHELTER CLOTHING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE'RE MAKING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PAYING FOR THAT FULL SPECTRUM AND THAT THAT'S GOOD AND THAT'S IT A FISCAL CHALLENGES WHILE. IF CENTER MONITORING ANOTHER QUESTION THANK UNITS KIND OF A FOLLOW UP ON ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST AS QUESTION. I KNOW MODERATES BEEN INNOVATIVE IN EARLY WITH CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAMS BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN THE CHALLENGE HAS ALWAYS BEEN. FUNDING -- WE HEAR FROM OUR SHERIFF'S THAT ARE COUNTY JAIL SIR. HOLDING PENS FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES -- DO YOU KNOW OFFHAND HOW MUCH OF YOUR BUDGET OR PUT IT COSTS IS TO MAINTAIN THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM FROM THE BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH SIGN IT I THINK THERE ARE KIND OF ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS. HOSPITAL BASED CRISIS TEAMS ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO THERE'S TWENTY FOUR HOUR SEGMENTS WITH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. OR MOBILE CRISIS HAS -- DIFFERENT STAFFING RIGHT NOW LIKE A TWO TO TEN SCHEDULE BASED ON PEAK HOURS I THINK THE OP THE GAP LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WASN'T COVERED BUT THAT -- IS A FRACTION OF WHAT'S NEEDED IN TERMS OF MOBILE DIVERS SO WE HAVE THREE THREE TEAMS AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS QUITE A BIT MORE TO RESPOND TO THE SCHOOL BASED EMERGENCIES. SO OUR ARMY OF SCHOOL BASED CLINICIANS ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO SOME OTHER DAY JOB BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CRISIS IS HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS NOT TO WE WANT TO MAKE MORE OF A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. IN USE CRISIS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK ONE THING THAT WE HELPFUL FOR US WHETHER IT'S COUNTY BY COUNTY OR STATE WIDE. THERE'S SO MANY AREAS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH BROAD CATEGORY. BIT. SOME IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. A BUDGET SHORTFALL. FOR FOR TEAMS FOR CHILDREN'S CRISIS INTERVENTION. AND BE HELPFUL FOR US EVEN JUST TO GET. SOME OF THOSE BALLPARK FIGURES -- THAT AND THEN HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE. WHERE YOU PUT THE MONEY I KNOW THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAMS -- NOT ONLY PROTECT. INNOCENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY IT ALSO PROTECTS ALONG FORSMAN OFTEN TO HAVE ALLIES WHO MIGHT HAVE A HISTORY. WITH A PRIOR PATIENT OR A PATIENT WHO'S IN CRISIS -- THAT INTERFACE CAN OFTEN -- AND OTHERWISE MINA SITUATION THAT HAS A BAD ENDING EITHER FOR THE PATIENT OR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. SO ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN SHARE WITH US THAT'S EITHER MONTEREY COUNTY BASED OR STATE WIDE -- JUST SO WE KIND OF KNOW WHERE THESE CATEGORIES ARE AND WHAT THE SHORTFALL SUMMER WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANYONE ELSE. THE COUPLE QUESTIONS -- FIRST WELL DIRECTOR CAN'T JUST A QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE MOVE UP AND DOWN THE CONTINUING CARE FROM MILD TO MODERATE TO SEVERE AND BACK DO WE HAVE ANY. YOU KNOW I I THINK WE THE DATA THAT I SHARED -- IN THE CHARTS THAT I HAVE IS KIND OF THE BEST WAY THAT WE HAVE IT WITH THAT'S THE KIND OF OUR ATTEMPTED A PROXY. BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO -- IS WE KNOW THE ADULTS AND PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS THAT ARE USING EXCLUSIVELY SHORT OIL SERVICES MEANING THERE'S THERE SOLELY IN THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THEN WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SOLELY USING THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT IN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND THEN I SAID THERE'S A GAP. THAT THEY'RE USING AND STRADDLING BOTH -- SYSTEMS AND WITHIN THAT WE PULL THE DATA OUT TO SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SHORT OIL SERVICES ARE USING VERSUS HOW MUCH OF THE MANAGED CARE AND THAT OVERLAP. AND THAT'S KIND OF OUR BEST CLOSEST -- WAY OF TRYING TO APPROX ME INTO IN BETWEEN THE TWO DELIVERY SYSTEMS BUT WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A HARD AND FAST KIND OF DATA POINT THAT WE CAN JUST PULL OT OF OUR DATA WAREHOUSE TO SAY OH YEAH THESE INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WERE YOU KNOW SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND THIS YEAR THEY'RE EXCLUSIVELY MILD YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EXIST AND NOT KIND OF A NEAT OF A FORMAT BUT I'M HAPPY -- TO SURE THAT DATA IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT. THANK YOU --% SO WHAT HAPPENS LOCALLY WHEN THIS WHEN PEOPLE SLIDE AROUND IN THE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE -- SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A MANAGED CARE PLAN TO WORK ON TRANSITIONS IN CARE SO SAY A PERSON WAS SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL OR TRYING TO STEP THEM DOWN SO WE TRY TO DO A WARM HAND OFF -- TO THE EXTENT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MILD NETWORK AND WE KNOW THAT WE MONITOR QUITE CLOSELY THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE NOT RECEIVING BOTH SERVICES AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE MANAGED CARE WHEN A PERSON. ON THEIR OWN VOLITION TRIES TO DO THAT WE'VE SEEN AND PRODUCED IN NILES AND AND MOVE A PERSON BACK OVER. SO WE WORK PRETTY CLOSELY TO TRY TO MANAGE THAT BUT IT'S COMPLEX BECAUSE PEOPLE'S NEEDS CHANGE DAY TO DAY THESE ARE HUMANS NOT YOU KNOW QUANTIFIABLE. RIGHT ENTITIES SO THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGE BETWEEN THAT MILD MODERATE DISTINCTION. GRAY -- CONSIDERING -- THE AND THIS BACK TO YOU DIRECTOR CAN'T OF CONSIDERING THAT DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE GETTING ACCESS TO CARE OR GETTING CARE TO SOME PEOPLE. HOW MUCH OR OR OR OR WHERE WERE YOU WITH THE TELEHEALTH AS FAR AS -- TELEHEALTH THROUGH -- CHAVIS EVEN EVEN EVEN POTENTIALLY THROUGH A DEVICE LIKE THIS. SO WE ISSUED -- CLARIFYING TELEHEALTH POLICY ACROSS ALL THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS MAYBE A MONTH OR TWO AGO SO WE REVIEWED AND ACTUALLY IT WAS DRIVEN BY THE MENTAL HEALTH -- SIDE OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND THAT THEY HAD A PER HELLO HEALTH -- BOTH POLICY AND REIMBURSEMENT -- SCHEME AND WE KIND OF WE LOOKED AT OUR PRIMARY -- ROLE INDIAN HEALTH DIVISION WE LOOKED AT THE MANAGED CARE DIVISION WE LOOK TO FEE FOR SERVICE WE LOOKED AT DENTAL WE LOOKED AT A CD AND WE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT IS EVERYBODY'S TELEHEALTH POLICY AND HOW DO WE DO THAT AND SO WE ISSUED GUIDANCE. TO EVERY SINGLE PART OF OUR PROGRAM AND SAID THIS IS WHAT THE TELEHEALTH POLICY IS IN TERMS OF THESE ARE THE CODES THAT ARE REIMBURSABLE UNDER THESE -- YOU KNOW BY THESE PROVIDERS I THINK -- IT'S NOT ONLY FROM A MENTAL HEALTH STANDPOINT BUT ALSO ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE RIGHT SO IF YOU ARE A AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A CHRONIC CONDITION AND YOU LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. AND HEMATOLOGIST IS DOWN IN SACRAMENTO BUT CAN CONSULT VIA TELEHEALTH THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO FACILITATE -- SO WE HAVE A PRETTY I THINK -- BOTH BROAD AND OPEN ACCEPTANCE OF THE TELEHEALTH POLICY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WORKS FOR BOTH THE PROVIDER AND THE PATIENT -- IT IS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL I THINK IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AREA BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF VIDEO CONFERENCE SEEN YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE SHASTA FOR EXAMPLE WHERE -- THEY HAVE A PRETTY -- AMAZING SET AS INFRASTRUCTURE I TS TYPES OF DEVICES -- WHERE YOU THEY LINK DOWN HERE TO UC DAVIS FOR PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS -- THOSE ARE BOTH PRACTICES AND INNOVATIVE WAYS OF DELIVERING CARE THAT WERE WERE SUPPORT OF US [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY. SO WE'LL PUT YOU'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES FOR ANOTHER PANEL SO AT THIS POINT WE WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU AND WE'LL BRING UP -- OUR NEXT PANELIST -- RYAN MELENDEZ. SEC BROTHER RYAN RYAN AND RYAN AND GUEST SO -- SO SO WE RHYME MELENDEZ IS A FISCAL POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- MISTER MELENDEZ WILL DESCRIBE FINANCING IN SPENDING ON PUBLIC. A MENTAL A MIDDLE SERVICES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. MISTER MELINDA'S PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULDN'T MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- BRUNDTLAND. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SOME WITH. THE DEPUTY ANALYST FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MARK NEWTON SAID ON THE FINANCING STRUCTURE FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT. SHOULD BE IN YOUR PACKAGE TO GO OFF OF SO -- BEGINNING ON PAGE ONE I WANTED TO START OFF -- TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR PUBLIC. COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- I WANT TO DO THIS UP. BECAUSE ESPECIALLY FOR COUNTY BASED OF MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH -- THE FUNDING IS DEEPLY INTEGRATED% WITH THE BROADER PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH OF FUNDING SYSTEM AND BY -- JUST WANNA CLARIFY BY PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH -- WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS -- BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT A PUBLIC PLEA PROVIDED PRIMARILY IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS -- BUT WHICH DOES ALSO DOES NOT MRS STATE HOSPITALS PRISONS -- AND SERVICES FROM MEDICARE -- PRIVATE INSURANCE OR THE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM. IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE THREE OF THE FIGURE. WHAT WE CAN SEE IS A? FOR THE OVERALL PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH -- SERVICE SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT A TEN BILLION ALMOST TEN BILLION DOLLARS -- WITH THE FUNDING AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AT WITS BREAKS DOWN -- LARGELY BY COUNTY AND NON COUNTY BASED SERVICES -- FOR THE NON CAN BE SERVICES THIS IS ENTIRELY A MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE -- PROVIDED THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL -- MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND STATE FEE FOR SERVICE. WHICH PROVIDE THE SO CALLED MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES -- FUNDED THROUGH STATE JOURNAL FOR DOLLARS. THIS TOTALS ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THESE OUTPACING A MULTI MODERATE SERVICES. THE BULK OF THE FUNDING HOWEVER GOES TO YOU COUNTY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL THAT WOULD BE. THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THE PRIDE THE SPELLS FLUTIE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE AT THE MORE INTENSIVE SEVERE -- INPATIENT SERVICES FOR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT THIS ALSO AGAIN PAYS -- FOR OTHER COUNTY BASED ON A WHOLE SERVICES THROUGH THE PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF SAFETY NET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- SO THIS TOTALED ABOUT SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FUNDING IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUT ESTIMATED ABOUT FOUR POINT NINE BILLION MEDI CAL -- METAL SERVICES OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- AND THE SO THE FUNDING FOR THIS COMES FROM OF AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAM CERTAINLY -- FEDERAL FUND FEDERAL MEDICAID MEDICAID DOLLARS AND SOME G. STATE GENERAL FUND. BUT ALSO SUBSTANTIAL LOCAL MATCH -- AND THIS -- LOOK MATCH FOR A TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAS -- ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL WE ESTIMATE -- AND THAT COMES FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF FUNDING STREAMS ITSELF -- INCLUDING IN TWENTY ELEVEN REALIZE -- THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND COUNTY GENERAL FUND AS WELL -- WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE -- WHAT THE? POR **** WHAT PROPORTIONS OF THIS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF TOTAL. FOR LOCAL MATCH COMES FROM EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL -- FUNDING SOURCES AND THIS IS DUE -- IN LARGE PART BECAUSE EACH OF THE FUNDING SOURCES -- SUPPORTS BOTH UP MEDI CAL AT THE SPORTS BOTH MEDICAL AND AUTOMATE MEDI CAL. US MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR SUPPORTS -- MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT HAS ALSO -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND COUNTIES HAVE -- DISCRETION ON HOW THEY ALLOCATE THE DIFFERENT LOVE PORTIONS OF EACH OF THOSE FUNDING STREAMS TO THEIR VARIOUS. OF OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING. IF YOU LOOK ON GOING BACK ON ITS -- FOR I'LL GO MORE INTO MORE DETAIL ON THE DIFFERENT -- AT FEET INTO YOU -- MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STARTING WITH THE FINAL FUND PARTICIPATION FROM -- MEDI CAL THIS CONSTITUTES MORE THAN HALF OF THE OVERALL MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TYPICALLY PAYS FOR ABOUT 50% OF COSTS FOR IT FROM MOST MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HOWEVER -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS NOTABLY -- ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION IS THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR NOT YOU KNOW OVER 90% OF THE COST FOR ENROLLEES WERE MADE ELIGIBLE THROUGH -- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MEDICAID EXPANSION. SO WE ESTIMATES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT -- THE FEDERAL FRONT PARTICIPATION FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS ABOUT. A FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS -- FUNDING SOURCE -- BUT OVERALL OF FUNDING SOURCE PUSH FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING BUT AS AS WELL AS THE BILL FOR ALL PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEM. MOVING ON TO A LOCAL REALIGNMENT A REVENUES SO BOTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN -- TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. A DEDICATE -- SALES TAX IN VEHICLE LICENSE FEE REVENUE TO COUNTIES TO PAY FOR THEIR VARIOUS -- BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THIS IS THE LARGEST -- NON FEDERAL -- FUNDING SOURCE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES -- IN THE PUBLIC IMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM -- IN TOTAL -- WE ESTIMATE ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF TOTAL REALIGNMENT FUNDING WITH THE COUNTIES -- FOR THEIR MEDICAL AND NOT SERVICES. FOR NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- SPECIFICALLY THIS. REALIGNMENT SHIFTED FUNDING RESPONSIBILITIES TO COUNTIES -- FOR NOT A DONNELLY MEDI CAL MENTAL. HEALTH SERVICES A COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT ALSO -- SAFETY NET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND NOT FEDERALLY REIMBURSABLE INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE -- THE SALUDABLES THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE COUNTIES -- FROM THE STATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR FUNDING. IS THROUGH A SERIES OF FORMULAS THAT ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON HOW MUCH COUNTY SPENT. ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES -- UP FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL -- NINETEEN ANYONE REALIGNMENT REVENUES TO COUNTIES AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT -- TRANSFERRED -- FUND RESPONSIBILITIES TO COUNTIES FOR THE REMAINING MEDI CAL SPECIAL MENTALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING -- CHILDREN'S EARLY -- PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT THREE PST T. SERVICES -- HAVE IT ALSO -- REALIGNED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS A TO THE COUNTIES. AND STE UNDER THE SAME -- SHARED BEHAVIOR HEALTH ACCOUNTS -- SO WHILE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT -- FUNDING A DISTANT TO BE MORE -- WELL ALIGNED WITH A MORE UPDATED -- DATA ON COUNTY SPENDING A IN THIS AREA -- COUNTY IS STILL DO HAVE -- TO PARSE BETWEEN FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FOR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES WITHIN THIS FIND AND IT'S NOT IT'S THEIR DISCRETION HOW THEY DECIDE -- TO TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS BETWEEN THE TWO SERVICES AND SO WE ESTIMATES -- THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. FOR PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE MIDDLE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. OF TWO THOUSAND FOR THIS -- YOU KNOW IT'S FUNDING IS IS ON HIGHER INCOME EARNERS IN THE STATE -- AND IS MEANT LARGELY FOR SERVICES THAT KIND OF GO BEYOND -- THOSE TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED BY MEDI CAL -- INTENSIVE UP PREVENTATIVE AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES THINGS LIKE WORKFORCE -- TRAINING AND A DEVELOPMENTS -- DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- BUT WE DON'T THAT -- COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THEIR FUNDING -- FOR L. LOCAL MATCH FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EVEN AS THE MAJORITY OF THEIR THERE FUNDING GOES TO OTHER KINDS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUTSIDE OF MEDI CAL. AND SO TOTAL MINUTE -- AND ME TO SAY FUNDING TO COUNTY IS WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FINALLY -- WITH THE STATE GENERAL FUND. THIS TENDS TO BE A A MORE LIMITED A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS. AGAIN LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE THE FACT THAT TWENTY ELEVEN AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT A SHIFTED -- LOTS OF THE FUNDING RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT'S WHERE -- ONE OF THE LARGEST COSTS FROM MENTAL AN ACCOUNT OF THE HEALTH LAW -- THE THE THE STATE THOUGH STILL PROVIDE SOME GENERAL FUND TO COUNTIES FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIS IS. THE STILL TO BE -- FOR SERVICES THAT ARE -- POST TWENTY ELEVEN AS A RESULT OF PROP PROPOSITION THIRTY WHERE -- THIS MIGHT HAVE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OR ENHANCED SERVICES FROM STATE FEDERAL OR TRADITIONAL -- MANDATES -- AT FOR EXAMPLE THE ACA EXPANSION WHICH EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY -- THE THE THE AMOUNT OF A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. TO YOU -- THIS ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS WILL BE COVERED BY THE AND AGAIN LASTED GOLF AND PROVIDES THE THE NON FEDERAL UP PORTION OF THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE AKA MULTI MODERATE SERVICES IN TRADITIONAL MEDICARE AL -- ESTIMATE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN STARTING ON PAGE -- SEVEN I'LL PROVIDE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR MEDI CAL -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS YOU CAN SEE THE FIGURE -- BELOW THE BETWEEN FEDERAL FUNDS STATE JOURNAL FUND AND THE LOCAL MATS WHICH AGAIN. INCLUDES OF BOTH REALIGNMENT FUNDS -- AND IT'S A SAY AND COUNTY GENERAL FUND -- TOTAL MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING CONSTITUTE CONSTITUTED ABOUT SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS MORE THAN TWO THIRDS. OF TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. A ON PAGES. EIGHT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT OF THAT -- BUT ACCOUNT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING MORE THAN 70% OF IT GOES TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO ABOUT ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO YOU ON THAT ACCOUNT -- MINUTES CARE PLANS. AND UP LESS THE ON PAGE -- NINE WITH FIGURES SHOWS BLOWS -- THE SOME OF THE FUNDING A MORE RECENT FUNDING GROWTH OVER TIME FOR COUNTY BASED -- MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH RISING FROM ABOUT THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO COVERING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER -- SERVICE UTILIZATION RATES. BOB THIS CONCLUDES MY BRIEF I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM HERE. WE QUESTIONS WITH THE YOU YOU JUST YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION JUST A SECOND AGO THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. OKAY NO GREAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. WE GO BACK TO A BRING BACK OF ITS COUPLE FAMILIAR FACES -- I HEAR THE GO WE HEARD THAT -- IS OUR FOURTH FENNEL I WAS QUALITY MEASURED INSURED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN MEDI CAL. SO ONCE AGAIN IT WILL BE -- DIRECTOR CAN'T AND DIRECTOR MILLER -- WILL PRIDE RIGHT AN OVERVIEW OF MEDI CAL -- MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED HOW CARE IS DELIVERED SO. THANK YOU TO SEEMS LIKE MOMENTS AGO YOU WERE HERE. IT WAS IT WAS THE BUT THE BRUTE STRENGTH OF TIME -- SO THANK YOU SO I WOULD SAY THAT -- IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FEDERAL ALL THAT REALLY DID SUBSTANTIVELY CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO BETWEEN. OVERSIGHT OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- AS HAD PREVIOUSLY -- BEEN VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WASN'T OVERSIGHT BUT THE MANAGED CARE RULE PUT IN SUCH -- GRANULAR DETAIL AROUND NETWORK ADEQUACY TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS AND I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE -- PASS LEGISLATION AROUND HOW WE WERE GOING TO SET THOSE TIME DISTANCE STANDARDS AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST JULY -- ALL OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- FILED NETWORK AS NETWORK FILINGS WITH US AS A DEPARTMENT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK ON THEIR PART IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK ON OUR PART -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE GET BETTER AT THIS IN TERMS OF WE HAVE GONE BACK AND WORKED WITH THE COUNTIES TO REFINE -- YOU KNOW ACTUAL F. T. E.'S AND HOW WE COUNT THOSE PROVIDERS AND HOW DO YOU -- ACCOUNT FOR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND LOTS OF OTHER BOTH ADULT AND PEDIATRIC POPULATION AND AS A CAT PSYCHIATRIST DOING. YOU KNOW PRESCRIPTION MANAGEMENT VERSES AND DIFFERENT KIND OF PROVIDER -- I THINK WHAT THE MANAGED CARE RULE REALLY DID WAS HIGH LATE BOTH THE IMPORTANCE -- FOR US AS A STATE AS WELL AS FOR SIMMERS THAT -- WE CAN'T-- WE CAN'T IMPROVE WHA WE CAN'T MEASURE AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE AS A STATE ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO MEASURE -- THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE IN A GIVEN -- NETWORK WE'RE LOOKING AT UTILIZATION DATA WE'RE LOOKING AT TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS AND APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES AND LANGUAGE COMPETENCY AND A LOT OF REALLY. IMPORTANT UNDER PENDING -- DETAIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT OF HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES IN THE STATE AND SO. THROUGH THAT -- WE HAVE. BEEN WORKING PRETTY DILIGENTLY WITH THE COW -- CLOSE ACTION PLANS THAT WERE ISSUED AS A PART OF THE NETWORK FILINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE ANNUALLY CERTIFY IN THESE NETWORKS. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTIES ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE THAN WE WOULD BE EITHER PUTTING THEM UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS OR IN THE CASE OF EITHER PERSISTENT OUR ON GOING -- FAILURE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER FINANCIAL -- SANCTIONS ARE PENALTIES THEM FOR THESE FOR THESE AND ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE TO FILE THESE THIS IS NOT JUST ISOLATED TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT QUALITY MONEY IN OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW THAT WE SHARED A LOT OF DETAIL -- WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF BACKGROUND DATA -- WE HAVE A BOTH A GROWING AND A MORE ADVANCED SCENE SET OF DATA METRICS -- BROKEN DOWN BY POPULATION BROKEN DOWN BY AGE BROKEN DOWN BY SERVICE CATEGORY AND REALLY WHAT I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO DO COLLECTIVELY IS TO LOOK AND SAY YOU KNOW ARE THERE COUNTIES -- SUCH AS THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD ON THE PANEL BEFORE WHERE THEIR OUTCOMES APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN DIFFERENT COUNTY AND WHAT'S THAT RELATED TO AND I THINK THAT IT'S ONLY THROUGH. KIND OF THIS ADVANCEMENT AND THE DATA ANALYTICS -- AND THE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT AS MUCH AND AS HARD AS IT IS TO DO IS THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START TO SEE KIND OF SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE I THINK AND THAT'S THE BOTH ARE -- INTENSE IN TERMS OF COMPLYING WITH THE FEDERAL RULES AND BUT ALSO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WAIVER RENEWAL AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS A STATE GOING FORWARD WE CAN'T CREDIBLY COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR HOW WE WANT TO GET THERE IN THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY. KNOW WHERE WHERE THE GAPS ARE NOW AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE COUNTIES -- SO FAR HAS BEEN. DONE WITH THE INTEREST OF MAKING SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE WHAT WE WANT TO IMPROVE AND SO. THE QUALITY MONITORING AND THAT WE HAVE AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID WE WE CERTAINLY ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE DETAILS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS WELL -- WE LOOK AT PENETRATION RATES WE LOOK AT APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES WE LOOK AT ACCESS -- THOSE ARE ALL INTENDED TO HELP BOTH DR -- QUALITY NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTY THAT'S ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO DRIVE AN OVERALL QUALITY STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE -- HELD OURSELVES AND THE AND THE COUNTIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SO YOU HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS BUT IT IS A IT IS A HEARING TOPIC WORTHY OF A GREAT DEAL OF PAPER AND AND DATA THAT WE WILL PROBABLY AND SO SO -- SO. WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT LAYERS OF LOOKING AT QUALITY WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IS IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH PLAN WE OPERATE LIKE. DIRECTOR CAN'T SAID WE OVERSEE ALL THE SAME MANAGED CARE RULES PLUS WE DIRECTLY PROVIDE SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND THEN OVERSEE IT UP ROBUST NETWORK OF CONTRACT FOR WRITERS THAT ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE SERVICES. SO WE DO TRY ANNUAL REVIEWS PERFORMED BY DH CS WE ALSO HAVE AN ANNUAL EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW. AUDITS -- AND THEN WE WORK ON OUR NETWORK ADEQUACY -- STANDARDS OVERALL AND ALL THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SO THE TEACHER -- AUDIT IS PRETTY ROBUST IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEM REVIEW THEY INTERVIEW CONSUMERS TALK ABOUT TIMELINESS OF ACCESS MEASURE INDICATORS LIKE OUR BENEFICIARIES SERVICE PERFORMED. THE COST PER BENEFICIARY AND THEN HOW WE'RE SERVING SPECIFIC POPULATIONS LIKE THE FOSTER CARE POPULATION. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO -- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AT LEAST TWO PER YEAR TO INNOVATE AND AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DOMAIN. SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY THAT WERE CONTINUALLY WERE OUR SYSTEM -- THEY ALSO LOOK AT TIMELINESS TO ACCESS AND TREATMENT POST HOSPITALIZATION TIMELINESS AND TIMELINESS -- TO FIRST APPOINTMENTS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE CHARTS THAT EACH ROW PROVIDED JUST HAD MY COUNTY SWEET COMPARED TO OTHER MEDIUM SIZED COUNTY IS. THE STATE AND WE LOOK AT OUR OUR OWN DATA SOMETHING WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING ON IS OUR PENETRATION RATES. SPECIFICALLY WHAT I'M WORKING ON MY COUNTY IS THE INCREASING SERVICES PATINO POPULATIONS OF THIS IS A METRIC BUT I'M. I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO DO BETTER BETTER THAN STATEWIDE AVERAGES BUT WE LOOK AT THE PREVALENCE RATE A MENTAL ILLNESS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH MORE NEED AND SO MUCH MORE. AREAS OF GROWTH -- WE ALSO TWICE A YEAR ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AND ONCE YOU'RE ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS I DO CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEYS SO WE SURVEY PEOPLE AT OUR CLINICS AND IN OUR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS YOU'LL SEE THAT THE MOST RECENT RIVER. RESULTS STATEWIDE PUBLISHED BY DH CS SHOW. THAT WERE SORT OF HIGH STRENGTH AND GENERAL SATISFACTION WHERE OUR LOWEST RANKING OVERALL AREA IS LAW ON HELPING OUR CONSUMERS FEEL SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS WHICH IS JUST A REALLY IMPORTANT DOMAIN IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ACHIEVING THEIR LIFE GOALS AND OUTCOMES. THE EACH SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN HAS A PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD DIRECTOR CAN'T LARGELY ALREADY WENT OVER THAT THAT'S BOTH A COUNTY IN OVERALL AGGREGATE LEVEL FOR THE STATE. SO LOOKING AT STEP DOWNS IN CARE NEW PEOPLE HOW QUICKLY WERE RESPONDING TO SERVICE. THIS IS WHAT A NETWORK ADEQUACY MAP LOOKS LIKE IN MY COUNTY SO IT'S ENSURING OUR TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS WERE PRODUCING THESE ANNUALLY IN GETTING RECERTIFIED -- AND IT'S A DIFFERENT LAYERS THIS WAS JUST MY PSYCHIATRY MAP BUT THERE'S A LAYER SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN FOR ADULTS LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S IT ACCESSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. AND CERTAINLY TELL HEALTH HELPED US TO EXPAND THIS NETWORK EVEN MORE SO WE USE TELL HAVE QUITE EXTENSIVELY IN RURAL AREAS REFUNDED TO REALLY SUCCESSFUL. IN PARTICULAR THE LATINO POPULATION COMING IN FROM THE FIELDS THEY REALLY LIKED THAT -- MORE SO THAN WE ANTICIPATED. AND THE BIG QUESTION BECAUSE WE COULD LOOK AT DASH WAS FOR AWHILE I THINK EVEN DIRECTOR CAN'T SAYS OUR DASHBOARD OR SLIGHTLY OVERWHELMING. FOR THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE DOING THE BEHAVIOR HALL SYSTEM IS ARE WE INSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW A PLACE TO LIVE A PLACE TO HEAL AND PEOPLE AT THEIR CONNECTED. TO AND SO I THINK WE'VE DEMONSTRATED TODAY THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF DIVERSITY IN THE TYPE OF SERVICES WERE PROVIDING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WHEN I THINK OF IN MY CHAIR. YOU KNOW WHAT AM I DOING FOR MY COMMUNITY I'M MORE THINKING ABOUT AND MY INSPIRING CULT BY MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS SEE THE POTENTIAL NEW LOOK AT THE SUICIDE RATES ARE SO ALARMING. YEAH THAT'S A DEATH OF DESPAIR SO HOW DO I MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED IN THE COMMUNITY AND I CLINICS ARE OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE THERE WERE INCREASING SAFETY BY BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE MALL RIGHT TIME TALKED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ABOUT OUR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES I THINK ARE. DEFINITELY SAVING LIVES BY BEING IN THE SCHOOLS AND BEING PRESENT YOU KNOW WE'RE ADDRESSING PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND WE'RE REDUCING YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF NEGATIVE INCIDENTS THAT WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO A DASHBOARD. THANKFULLY RIGHT -- AND THEN A BIG PIECE FOR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE WE DOING ALL WE CAN TO REDUCE INEQUITIES SO THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORICAL INEQUITY AND WE HAVE A LOT TO DO IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE POPULATIONS -- A BIG QUESTION FOR ME IS A DIRECTOR'S HAVE I JOINED WITH AN EMPOWERED FAMILIES SO MUCH OF OUR WORK YOU KNOW IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE'VE DONE SOME OF THE OTHER PANELS PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT. THEIR LOVED ONES STRUGGLING A WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY'RE FALLING BETWEEN THE CRACKS IN BETWEEN A HOSPITALIZATION OR GOING TO JAIL ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO TRAIN FAMILIES AND BE ACCESSIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND THEN. MOST IMPORTANTLY I'D SAY ARE ARE WE LEADING FOR THAT FROM THE TRENCHES SO AS I BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE REPRESENT SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SORRY MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE HEARING THEIR VOICE HELPING THEM TO GET THEIR NEEDS MET AND DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT REALLY RESPONSE TO THEM TO ME THAT SORT OF OUR OUR NUMBER ONE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR QUESTIONS. OKAY I HAVE SOME -- A DIRECTOR MILLER SO WHEN YOU PERFORM THESE BENEFITS SHERRY SATISFACTION -- SURVEYS OR FOCUS GROUPS OR WHATEVER. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT COME UP TRANSPORTATION -- SO EAGER -- DOES -- SATISFACTION GROUPS THAT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR SORT OF LINE WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT CONSUMER SATISFACTION THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRENDING DOWN ON THAT IT'S MORE FEEDBACK ABOUT ON IMPROVING TIMELINESS TO SERVICES AT TIMES -- BUT WHEN WE DO OUR LONG CONSUMER PERCEPTION SERVICES LIKE THIRTY FIVE QUESTIONS -- ITS A LOT AROUND TRANSPORTATION AND THEN YOU KNOW HELPING PEOPLE AGAIN WITH THEIR SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS WHEN I WAS LOOKING OUR MOST RECENT RESULTS WE PERFORMED REALLY WELL ON YOUR FAMILY SAYING MY CHILD GOT ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEEDED WHEN THEY NEEDED THEM -- BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAT WE SEE. SO THESE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE. OKAY OKAY THERE MY JUST ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION HERE SORRY IT HAPPENED. DOCTOR DIRECTOR CAN -- SO NGUYEN IMAGE WHEN MHP SUBMIT BEEN BENEFICIARY STE SATISFACTION SURVEY AND WHEN WE DID GO OUT TO THE COUNTIES FOR THE TRI IN DEALS -- WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AS WELL AS KIND OF SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA I THINK THAT -- THE CONSUMER -- RESPONSES AND FEEDBACK ARE PART OF AN OVERALL -- YOU KNOW A WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE SURVEYS YOU KNOW JUST FROM THAT YOU KNOW CHECK IN THE BOX MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING DONE. BUT I THINK WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN THE DOCUMENTATION WITH THE COUNTIES IS THE IS THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY'RE GETTING SOMEHOW EITHER INCORPORATED -- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THEIR SURVEYS -- GAPS -- FOR MAYBE L. G. B. T. POPULATIONS FEELING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TYPE OF PROVIDER IN THAT COUNTY OR SOMETHING AND THEN WHEN WE DO THE TRIENNIAL WE WOULD BOTH KNOW THAT AS A SURVEY RESPONSE BUT THEN ALSO NOTE THAT THE COUNTY HAD DONE SOMETHING TO EFFECTUATE. A CHANGE IN THAT AREA SO SOMETIMES IT'S NOT NECESSARILY REACTING TO THE SURVEY ITSELF IS IS IT'S LOOKING INTO THE COUNTIES PROCESS THAT THEY INCORPORATED IT AND SOMEHOW ADDRESS IT IN A WAY THAT. IF IT COULD BE MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THEN THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND AND IT WOULDN'T BE A SIGNIFICANT FINDING SO WHEN WE DO -- KIND OF SYSTEM -- REVIEWS WE NOT ONLY GO IN AND LOOK AT LIKE DID YOU FILL THE CHART OUT DOES IT HAVE THE PATIENCE SIGNATURE DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CODE YOU KNOW DID YOU MAKE THE RIGHT NOTE FOR THAT PARTICULAR DAY BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL SYSTEM. WE'RE LOOKING AT A KIND OF A BROAD PERSPECTIVE AS BOTH. BENEFICIARY FEEDBACK -- YOU KNOW OVERALL COMPLIANCE YOUR APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES SO SOMETIMES IF THE COUNTY HAD FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE TO US THAT BENEFITS YEARS I'M HAPPY BECAUSE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GET INTO AN APPEAL GRIEVANCE PERIOD THAT WOULD SEE THAT. YOU WOULD SEE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG THERE SO THEN WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE SURVEY DATA AND SAY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM AND IF YOU SAW THE SURVEY DATA THAT THE PATIENT WAS SAYING. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CLINICS AVAILABLE AND THE TIME THEY WILL THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY LEAD THEM TO HAVE SO THOSE ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WOULD USE THE DATA -- AND THE RESPONSES THAT KIND OF LEADS US TO OTHER PARTS OF THEIR OVERALL OPERATION TO SAY IS THIS BROKEN OR CAN IT BE IMPROVED. SO YOU USING THE INFORMATION THAT'S GENERATED BY THE COUNTIES AND EVALUATING THAT YEAH ARCHERY AND YELLS WE'RE ON SITE. FOR THREE TO SO YOU HAVE FIVE THREE TO FIVE DAYS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE COUNTY WITH THE TEAM SO WE ACTUALLY ARE IN THE COUNTY LOOKING AND TALKING AND GOING OUT TO PROVIDERS OFFICES AND DOING SHARPLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S A PRETTY EXTENSIVE REVIEW WHICH IS. WHY THEY'RE TRY ANY ELSE WHICH IS WE DO A THIRD OF THE COUNTIES IN ONE YEAR A THIRD OF THE COUNTIES THE NEXT YEAR AND A THIRD OF THE COUNTIES? SO WE'VE GOT ROTATING BECAUSE IT IS -- LABOR INTENSIVE TYPE BEFORE CLASS. IS OVER THERE TOP LIKE A TOP THE TOP THREE STATEWIDE. OR OR WHAT THE TOP IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES THAT YOU SEE CONSISTENTLY -- I WOULD. I WOULD SAY AND PSYCHIATRY SERVICES IN GENERAL CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS MOST ACUTELY -- IF YOU TALK TO ANYONE -- ANYWHERE THEY WILL SAY CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ONE OF HE MOST DIFFICULT PROVIDERS -- TO ATTAIN -- THEY ARE NOT -- NECESSARILY DEEPLY AN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS NOR THEY ACTUALLY INVOLVED AND PRIVATE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE -- THAT MUCH SO THERE IT EXCESSIVELY HARD TO GET -- AND THAT'S CONCERNING OBVIOUSLY FROM A FROM A ADMINISTRATORS PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN AND HOW DO YOU TRY TO PREVENT -- MENTAL ILLNESS FROM PROGRESSING -- PROGRESSING TO A MORE SEVERE FORM -- THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CHILD PSYCHIATRIST IN THE STATE -- IS A IS A DEEPLY CONCERNING AN ISSUE FOR US -- I THINK TRANSPORTATION WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY COME UP -- WHICH IN SOME CASES WE ARE HOPING WE SOFTEN WE DIRECTED THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAN IS PAYING FOR THE SERVICE OR NOT. SO -- ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE TWENTY FOUR CONTRACTING MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES FOR THEIR COVERED ENROLLEES. TO SERVICES WHETHER OR NOT THE PLAN IS ACTUALLY PAID FOR THOSE SO. SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE DENTAL CCS -- YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE THE PLANTS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND THAT WAS OUR WAY OF TRYING TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT WAS A GAP -- I THINK OTHER THAN THAT I THINK -- CRISIS STABILIZATION CRISIS AND HAS CONTINUE TO BE AN AREA IN WHICH MORE CAN BE DONE -- PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT COMES IN A TIME IN WHICH THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT ALWAYS KNOWN FOR BEING AVAILABLE YOU KNOW ON A ON A TIME IN WHICH THAT SYNCS UP NATURALLY WITH WHEN YOU'RE PEAK CRISIS SEES USUALLY INVOLVE WHICH IS. TYPICALLY AT NIGHT -- TYPICALLY ON THE WEEKENDS AND SO -- COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE CRISIS SERVICES BUT NOT NECESSARILY THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES THAT'S UP TO THE COUNTY TO DECIDE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE RURAL OR URBAN NATURE OF A COUNTY THAT CAN BE -- MORE DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT SHASTA HAS CERTAINLY BEEN PILOTING A NEW MOBILE CRISIS -- UNIT THAT HAS A SEEM TO GO VERY WELL BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THREE THAT IF I HAD A NAME THREE THOSE WOULD BE THE TOP THREE THAT WERE MOST AWARE OF AND AND SENSITIVE. TO OTHER TYPES OR I MEAN -- HOW MANY HOW MANY OR WHAT TYPES OF ISSUES AND A LEADING CALLS TO THE OMBUDSMAN FOR EXAMPLE -- IT USUALLY IS -- AROUND. ALL OF THE CALLS TO THE OMBUDSMAN CAN BE -- YES CAN BE CERTAINLY DIVERT STANDING OF WHAT -- THE BENEFIT IS -- SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LIKE THE PROVIDER -- SO THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROVIDER LIKE THEY WERE RUDE TO ME OR THE OFFICE STAFF WOULDN'T RETURNMY CALLS -- SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LIKE THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN -- DETERMINED APPROPRIATE FOR THEM SO IF THEY SOMETIMES IF IT'S A A PARENT THAT THINKS THEIR CHILD NEEDS A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT AND THE ASSESSMENT IS DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN THE COUNTY SAYS THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS NEEDING. A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT -- YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE ON YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET A CALL IN TO THE OMBUDSMAN SAYING I DISAGREE -- MORE OFTEN THAN THAT IS A USUALLY A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF WHERE DO I GO AND HOW DO I GET SERVICES WHICH YOU KNOW AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS TODAY WE RUN SIX DELIVERY [inaudible] EVERYONE I THINK WE ARE DEEPLY -- COMMITTED TO TRYING TO MAKE THAT MORE -- SEAMLESS FOR INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE -- MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I MEAN THAT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO TRY TO NAVIGATE ON THEIR OWN AND SO -- THAT'S USUALLY WHAT THE OMBUDSMAN IS DEALING WITH THIS PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY ACTION NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND BY WHICH SYSTEM -- HOW HOW TO HOW TO OUR PENETRATION RATES MATCH UP WITH PREVALENCE AND? HAS A VERY BY COUNTY OBVIOUSLY -- I WILL HAVE TO TAKE A LIFELINE ON THAT ONE BECAUSE OUR PENETRATION RATES I KNOW FROM A STATEWIDE -- PERSPECTIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW FROM MY COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE THEY STATEWIDE -- THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME FOR BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT THE PENETRATION RATES ABOUT 4% GIVE OR TAKE. POINT -- ONE POINT TWO ONE ON EITHER SIDE -- I KNOW THAT -- THE PENETRATION RATE FOR CHILDREN HAS BEEN A CONCERN -- FROM THE ADVOCATE CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT THEY FELT LIKE THE PENETRATION RATE SHOULD BE HIGHER -- BUT JUST FROM THE STAND LATER AND OUR DENOMINATOR HAVE GROWN BOTH YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT WORD NOT PREVIOUSLY AND SO -- I TEND TO THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY REFLECTIVE OF THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY KIND OF STABLE NUMBER BOTH PRE AND POST ACA BUT IT'S ALSO REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE PENETRATION RATE IS ON THE ADULT SIDE WHICH YOU KNOW TO THE PRESENTATION BY C. H. C. F.. WE KNOW KIND OF THE GENERAL POPULATION HAS THIS PERCENTAGE OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND BECAUSE IT'S A CHRONIC DISEASE AND SO THEREFORE WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY EXPECT THERE TO BE A HUGE SPIKE IN PENETRATION. BASED ON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DUE TO A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS JUST BECAUSE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A GROWING -- A GROWING -- DIAGNOSIS OR DISEASE STATE I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN GROWING AS AN INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES EARLIER AND DOING AN INTERVENTION EARLIER AND SAID THAT IS CERTAINLY AND BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN A DIAGNOSIS WITH THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO. THAT'S REALLY WHERE A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID BOTH ON THE COUNTY SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE ADVOCATE SIDE WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET TO KIDS. AND TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SERVICES PRIOR TO THEM BEING DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IF IF AT ALL POSSIBLE SO. IT'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HOW MUCH OF A CHANGE IT WAS WITH A CA RIGHT THE POPULATION JUST ONE UP SO MUCH MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN COLLABORATION WITH DH CS YOU KNOW KEEPING THE PENETRATION RATE. STABLE AND NOT NOT LOSING GROUND BECAUSE FUNDING HASN'T SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THANK YOU FOR MY THANK YOU. ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ANYTHING OKAY. SCENE NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONCE AGAIN. AND WILL HAVE NO GO AHEAD -- TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- ARE THERE THERE WAS THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH LIKE TO LIMIT THE COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES APIECE.

GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HEARING -- MY NAME IS PARTIALLY WALKER I'M WITH NOR CAL -- MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA AND A CO DIRECTOR ABOUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AND WE REPRESENT TO LGBT Q. POPULATIONS I'M HOPING THAT IN FUTURE HEARINGS WILL GET TO HEAR STATISTICS ABOUT. LGBT Q. FOLK -- AROUND THE STATE WE HEARD AROUND THE STATE THAT MANY TRANSGENDER FOLKS HAVE TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME. TO GET THEIR CARE -- EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT LGBT Q. PEOPLE ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN SUICIDE RATES DEPRESSION ANXIETY TRAUMA. AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AS WELL AS HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER DISPARITIES AND YET WE WE DON'T SEE THAT REPRESENTED OF COURSE IN ANY OF THE STATISTICS. THAT WE SAW TODAY SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION -- WHAT WE HEARD TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE POPULATIONS THAT WERE REPRESENTED? AND THAT WERE MISSING SOME VERY VALUABLE DATA -- AND I HOPE TO HEAR THAT SOON NOW THAT -- CERTAIN LEGISLATION HAS COME INTO EFFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ON A HOUSE OF LEAD WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA JUST WHEN I THINK THIS BODY -- FOR YOU'RE COMING TOGETHER IN A JOINT HEARING TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEX ISSUES -- AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW -- THAT OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM AROUND MENTAL HEALTH IS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS OUR STATE -- AND SO ANY SOLUTION AND SYSTEMS REFER A GREAT KIND OF FROM JUMP -- AND AT ALL LEVELS -- MENTAL HEALTH DOES NOT EXIST IN SILOS BUT OUR STATE IS NOTORIOUS -- NOTORIOUSLY KNOWN FOR SEILING OUT CARE -- BE AT AGE -- TO BASED INCOME BASED ETCETERA -- WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED OF COURSE BY THE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THESE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY -- BY THIS BODY -- AND URGE THAT WE COLLECTIVELY EXPLORE HOW WE EXPAND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES IN PARTICULAR -- INTEGRATING THOSE INTO TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS -- ESPECIALLY FOR OUR CHILDREN -- THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND AND FUTURE DEPEND ON THAT -- AND WE STAND AS READY AN ACTIVE THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WITH ON POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE THE CHAIR AND AND THE COMEDIAN HOLDING THIS SIZE HEARING IT'S IT'S BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE -- I THINK ONE THING THAT THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IS -- THAT THE FRAGMENTED SYSTEM BETWEEN -- IN THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH THE MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDING MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES AND I THE COUNTY PROVIDING MORE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- WHICH IS FURTHER COMPLICATED AS THE LA -- POINTED OUT IN THERE THE FINANCING OF OF OF THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND SO WHEN WHEN CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE EARD FROM OUR LEGAL AID ADVOCATES IS IS THAT THE DIFFICULTY IN NAVIGATING THATTHE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS -- AND WHICH IS PARTICULARLY WHEN I'M THERE THERE IS AN AGREEMENT WHETHER THE SERVICE IS MILD TO MODERATE OR A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THERE CAN BE A LOT OF BOUNCING BACK ON JUST TO GET THE SERVICE AND SO -- THE ROLES I CARE COORDINATION IS NEEDED AT THE AND THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED ON THE THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE IS IS CERTAINLY -- UP PAINS -- AS I HAVE A PICTURE WE'D LIKE TO SEE. MORE OF THAT ON THAT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SIDE THAT THAT DATE IS -- REFLECTED ON THE FOURTH MILD TO MODERATE AS WELL THANK YOU. GIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- SHOCK OF IT I WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION SEIU CALIFORNIA AND JUST WANT TO COMMEND -- THEIR COMMITTEE AND ON YOUR EXCELLENT BACKGROUND PAPER I THINK IT PROVIDES A LOT OF IMPORTANT FOUNDATIONAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO UNDERSTAND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT -- WELL WE DID A AN A PRO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATION WHETHER IT'S WITH THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OR WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES -- WE REALLY DO NEED TO PULL OUT A FEW DIFFERENT LEVELS -- AND THINK ABOUT IT BEYOND JUST THE FINANCING AND THE CONTRACTS RIGHT BECAUSE EVEN WITHIN THE MEDICAL MANAGE CARE SYSTEM AS YOU SEE FROM YOUR APPENDICES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MANAGED CARE PLAN THEN TURNING AROUND AND SUBCONTRACTING TO ANOTHER AND EIGHTY AND WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT. DOES THAT UNDERLYING DELIVERY SYSTEM LOOK LIKE FOR BENEFICIARIES SO DOES THE SUBSTANCE USE PROVIDER KNOW ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DOES THEM THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER UNDERSTAND ADDICTION. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE CONTINUE IN LOOKS REALLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON IT DOES WHETHER YOU'RE ON THE MILD TO MODERATE OR THIS SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS. I ONE MORE NOTE COUNTIES DO MUCH MORE THAN THE MEDIC HOW -- SMI DELIVERY THEY ALSO EXTEND INTO NON MEDICAL POPULATIONS WHETHER THREE PST T. OR AT A SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO WE WOULD URGE THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION AGAIN THAT GOES BEYOND -- JUST SORT OF HOW THE MONEY FLOWS AND WE LOOK AT THIS OPPORTUNITY OF THE INTEREST IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO TRULY TRANSFORM IT. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CALIFORNIA -- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE LOOK FORWARD [inaudible] THANKS [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AYE AYE OLLIE UNFAIR BUT THEY TING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THAT BOTH COMMITTEES FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND THE MATERIALS WERE VERY VERY -- INFORMATIVE INFORMATIVE AND CLEAR WHICH WE DON'T USUALLY SEE IN THE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS YOU SEE. I DO ONE ECHO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER'S COMMENTS ABOUT COUNTIES DON'T JUST DO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE OTHER FUNDING STREAMS AND PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES -- AND ALSO WE THINK THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM IS RIPE FOR COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDING WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES LIKE SCHOOLS LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ANYONE ELSE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY -- OUR NEXT HEARING -- WHICH WILL -- FOCUS ON HOW MENTAL HEALTH TO HAVE HELP MENTAL HEALTH. DELIVERY SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS TODAY WAS MEANT TO BE FOUNDATIONAL TALK ABOUT THE MONEY TALK ABOUT -- HOW IT'S FINANCED BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA TALK NEXT WEEK ABOUT HOW% IT ACTUALLY WORKS SO THAT IS ACTUALLY ON MARCH FIFTH -- WHICH IS A WEEK FROM TODAY -- WE HEAR A COLDER'S AFTER AN OVERVIEW BY DH CS AND C. B. HDA. WHICH MEANS WE MIGHT SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES AGAIN AT SOME POINT YES -- ON THEIR VISION FOR THE MEDI CAL MEDICARE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM GOING FORWARD. AND WITH THAT -- WE ARE ADJOURNED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERY FOR OUR PANELISTS AND THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE
