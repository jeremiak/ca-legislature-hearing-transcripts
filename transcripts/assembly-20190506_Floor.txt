FIFTY FOUR KNOWS FIFTEEN THAT MEASURE PASSES FILE ITEM SIXTY FIVE IS AB FORTINO. SEVEN CORPORATION. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTINO SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN ACRYLATE TO VEHICLES. MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU TODAY HAVE MEMBERS I BRING YOU AB FORTINO SEVEN THIS IS RESPONDING TO A GROWING PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT AND MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. AND THAT IS ILLEGAL STREET RACING. AND ALSO RECKLESS DRIVING. NOW STREET RACING. IS ALREADY ILLEGAL AND YET A GROWING PROBLEM AND I WOULD CONTEND BECAUSE THE PENALTIES THAT WE HAVE DON'T ALWAYS ADDRESS. THE REAL ROOT OF PEOPLE'S DESIRE TO DO STREET RACING FOR MONETARY REWARD SO RIGHT NOW THE FINES THAT PEOPLE GET IF YOU TALK TO ANYBODY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH OF A DETERRENT. AND IN ADDITION THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LAW THAT REQUIRES ILLEGAL MODIFICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO VEHICLES TO BE REMOVED BEFORE THE CARS RETURN. NOW RECKLESS DRIVING ISN'T JUST ROLLING THROUGH A STOP SIGN BY ACCIDENT OR MAKING ANY LEGAL RIGHT HAND TURN. RECKLESS DRIVING IS DRIVING WITH A WANTON DISREGARD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S A CRIMINAL MISDEMEANOR CHARGE. MY BILL SAYS THAT ON THE SECOND CONVICTION OF STREET RACING OR RECKLESS DRIVING YOUR CAR WILL BE IMPOUNDED BY FOR THIRTY DAYS. TAKING AWAY. PEOPLE'S WEAPON OF CHOICE IN THESE CASES. NOW THERE'S A LOT ABOUT FOR JUDGES IF IT'S A CAR THAT HAS TO BE USED FOR SOMEBODY TO GET TO WORK OR IF THE CARS BEING DRIVEN BY SOMEBODY'S CHILD. AND LOTS OF OTHER REASONS OF IT'S A HARDNESS ON THE FAMILY. BUT WHEN WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OF MY DISTRICT THEY SAY THAT THE ONLY THING THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ACTIVITY CARE ABOUT. IS LOSING THAT VEHICLE FOR AN FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT WILL WORK. AND IT'S ONE THAT'S NEEDED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD ANOTHER CHILD KILLED BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL STREET RACING WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING THERE'S CARNAGE ON OUR STREETS. DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT. AND PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO RESPECT AGAIN THIS IS ON THE SECOND CONVICTION. WITH THAT NUMBER SO I WOULD REQUEST FULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THERE WAS FRIEDMAN.

ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT BY SUMMER BLOOM AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE OF PESTICIDES MR BELOW. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO THE LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED THAT THE MOUNTAIN LION. KNOWN AS P. -- FORTY SEVEN FROM THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS HAD DIED DUE TO ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE POISONING. IN FACT HE HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR SIX DIFFERENT CHEMICALS FOUND IN THESE WROTE DOWN THE SIDES. P. FORTY SEVEN HOWEVER IT WAS ONE OF ONLY FIFTEEN MOUNTAIN LIONS THAT CALL THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS HOME. BUT WAS OF THOSE FIFTEEN THE FOURTH ONE ABOUT SENSITIVE POPULATION IT HAS DIED DIRECTLY AS A RESULT. OF RODENTICIDE POISONING. IN FACT TESTING IS SHOWN THAT NEARLY EVERY MOUNTAIN LION HAS RAT POISON IN THEIR SYSTEM. THERE ARE MANY OTHER TOP LEVEL PREDATORS AND WILDLIFE THAT HAVE BEEN POISONED AND KILLED. AND ACROSS THE STATE MANY CASES WHERE PETS OF BEEN POISONED AFTER INGESTING THESE CHEMICALS. ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE THIS BECAUSE ANIMALS TO BLEED OUT INTERNALLY AND THIS ALSO DISRUPTS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS NATURAL ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS AND AFFLICTIONS SUCH AS MANGE WHICH ULTIMATELY IS THE DISEASE THAT TAKES MANY OF THESE ANIMALS. IN THE THREE MAJOR MOUNTAIN LINE STUDIES CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA RODENTICIDE HAVE APPEARED IN EVERY TISSUE SAMPLE TAKEN FROM WILD ADULT LIONS AT LEVELS HIGH ENOUGH TO BE OF SERIOUS CONCERN. ANOTHER STUDY REGARDING THE ENDANGERED PACIFIC FISHER HAS SHOWN THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND THREATS THAT RODENTICIDE POSE AND IT'S CAN CONTRIBUTION TO THAT SPECIES NEAR EXTINCTION. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS BEEN WARNING ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT ROSANNA SITES ARE HAVING ON ALL WILDLIFE IN THE STATE AND AS A RESULT OF THESE WARNINGS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION REGULATION ENACTED REGULATIONS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE. IN THE HOPES OF DECREASING THE NON TARGETED DEATHS BUT THESE REGULATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN SECONDARY WILDLIFE POISONINGS. INSTEAD THEY HAVE STAYED CONSTANT OR IN SOME CASES INCREASED. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PROHIBITS THE USE OF SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ALSO PROHIBITS THE USE OF FIRST GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE. ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY WITH EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PROCESSING USES. NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND MORE HUMANE MEANS OF CONTROLLING RODENT POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING SUCCESSFULLY IS BY THE PET MANAGEMENT. INDUSTRY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DAVIS BLOOM DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I DON'T OFTEN GET UP ON THE FLOOR TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S BILLS -- BUT I'M MAKING AN EXCEPTION HERE I MAKE AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE I CARE. ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT THE CARE ABOUT THE RAPTORS THE MOUNTAIN LIONS THE COYOTES. WE HAVE AN ORGANIZATION CALLED RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION RATS. WHICH POINTS OUT THAT BY KILLING THE MOUNTAIN LIONS WITH THESE RODENTICIDE BY KILLING. THE RAPTOR WE ARE LIMITING THE WAYS WE CONTROL THE ROADS IN THE WILD. THIS IS TRULY SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO HIT THE HEART SPRINGS HEART STRINGS OF EVERYONE HERE. AND I'M HOPING IT DOES BECAUSE WE HAVE GOOD SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS HARMING OUR WILDLIFE. AND IT HAS TO STOP NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT QUIRK. THIS FRIEDMAN YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT JUST YESTERDAY THE U. N. REPORTED THAT. APPROXIMATELY A MILLION SPECIES ON THE EARTH ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION DUE TO YOU. THE ACTIVITY OF HUMAN BEINGS. I LIVE IN THE HILLS IN GLENDALE. AND WHEN I SEE COYOTES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S VERY VERY COMMON. THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS OF ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE. ANIMALS SPOTTED AROUND THE AREA WITH MANGE. THIN. SUFFERING WEEK. WE SEE DEAD HAWKS AND OWLS IN THE COMMUNITY. I REPRESENT GRIFFITH PARK. MOUNTAIN LIONS DYING. BECAUSE OF RODENTICIDE HAS BECOME A HUGE AREA OF CONCERN. FROM THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE OUR WILDLIFE BEING POP POISON NEEDLESSLY. I HEARD A VERY INTERESTING REPORT FROM I BELIEVE IT WAS FROM THE CITY OF OXNARD OR SOMEWHERE IN VENTURA WHERE THEY HAD DONE A STUDY. WHERE THEY TOOK AN AREA THAT WAS A SENSITIVE AREA BECAUSE OF RATS AND THEY TOOK TO PARTS AND THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW BASICALLY IDENTICAL AREAS? AND ONE AREA THEY USE THE RODENTICIDE AND ANOTHER AREA THEY USED RAPTORS JUST BY PUTTING A RAPTURE HOUSE UP IN A RAFTER MOVED IN. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS AND THEY WERE DONE ASIDE AREA. THE RATS ACTUALLY THE POPULATION OF RIGHTS ACTUALLY INCREASED BECAUSE WHEN THE RATS DID EAT THE ROAD UNDECIDED POISON THE RAPTORS AND THE RAPTORS DIED. THE AREA THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE CHEMICALS THAT WAS USING ONLY THE RAPTORS SAW A DRAMATIC DECREASE IN THE RAP POPULATION. SO NOT ONLY IS THIS CHEMICAL CRUEL AND CAUSING HAVOC AMONGST THE WILDLIFE THAT WE WANT TO PRESERVE. BUT IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE NO I HAVE SEEN THE BILL THE BILL HAS. SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS FOR MEDICAL EMERGING -- FOR FOR EMERGENCIES ABOUT COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND IN CERTAIN PLACES IT'S A VERY BALANCED APPROACH. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR MY COMMUNITY. I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF EMAILS OF SUPPORT FROM CONSTITUENTS I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE AS WELL IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL JOIN ME AND DOCTOR QUIRK OF COURSE WERE MISSED -- THE MEMBER FROM SANTA MONICA IN VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS LONG TIME WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU MEMBERS. THERE WAS FRIEDMAN MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THAT WE HAD THIS BILL AND THE WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALTHOUGH I THINK THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL IS A GOOD -- ONE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE GENTLEMAN FROM -- WEST HOLLYWOOD WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO -- BUT IT IS TOO OVER BROAD AND AS WE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE IN THIS FIELD -- IF IF YOU TOTALLY BAN THIS PRODUCT. WE ARE GOING TO LOSE A VERY VITAL TOOL IN GETTING THAT RODENTS WHICH DO YOU KERRY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. WHICH WILL HAVE IMPACTS IN OUR IN OUR URBAN AND OUR RURAL AREAS -- RAPTORS ARE GREAT BUT THEY CAN'T DO THE JOB ALONE -- AND SO THE ISSUE HERE IS. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE OUT COMPLETELY ESSENTIALLY A PRODUCT. THAT IS USED TO HELP KEEP DOWN DISEASE TO KEEP ROAD RODENTS AND OTHER -- VARMINTS FROM SPREADING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND AGAIN ON TOP OF THIS WE HEARD FROM THE PROFESSIONALS WHO USES ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS THEY USE IT CAREFULLY. THEY USE IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THAT PRODUCT. THESE ARE PROFESSIONALS WHO DO THIS DOES THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD BE MAKING THAT DECISION. NOT THOSE OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERTISE. AND SO I'D ASK YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS I THINK THIS BILL IS IS WAY TOO OVER BROAD -- ESSENTIALLY COULD PUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS -- AND TAKE A VITAL PRODUCT TOLD OUT OF PRODUCTION THAT WE DO NEED. TO HELP WITH THESE WITH A VITAL ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO VOTE NO PLEASE. MR VOEPEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I SELDOM GET UP TO SPEAK. LIKE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM HAYWARD. BUT I MUST TELL YOU. THAT I HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL EVEN AGAINST SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND A BIG GIVEN TO ME AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE FINDING OUT AND PLEASE YOU KNOW GOOGLE OR WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO. CHECK MY NUMBERS. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS IN THE MARIJUANA FIELDS THAT ARE BEING CULTIVATED ILLEGALLY BY CARTELS UP IN THE EMERALD TRIANGLE. THAT. THEY ARE USING THESE COAGULANT AND OTHER ILLICIT. POISONS TO KILL THE RODENTS THAT HAPPENED A LIKE TO EAT. THE MARIJUANA PLANTS AND GET HIGHER WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING NOW. PLEASE GOOGLE THIS BUT IT LOOKS TO ME. LIKE THE SPOTTED OWL POPULATION IS DROPPED 31%. AND MANY OF THESE RAPTORS ARE DYING. BECAUSE THEY'RE EATING THE RODENTS THAT HAVE BEEN POISONED. BY. ALL SORTS OF CHEMICALS SOME GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL. BASED UPON THOSE CONCLUSIONS I'VE DRAWN AND I HOPE YOU ALL. MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE DRAW THE SAME CONCLUSIONS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISS VOEPEL. SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM FOR THE BODY.

INCLUDING THE USE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE DOCUMENT SERVITUDE AS A PRACTICE OF AN EMPLOYER WITHHOLDING AND IMMIGRANTS LEGAL DOCUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF MANIPULATING THE EMPLOYEE. WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS BEING IMMIGRANTS IT'S VITAL THAT WE PROTECT THESE WORKERS BY PREVENTING UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR EMIGRATE XIN STATUS. AB FIVE EIGHTY NINE HELPS PROTECT WORKERS I CAN SEE MORE OF A MORAL PRACTICE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES IT IS MY HONOR TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY CURRENT ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION. SEVENTY WHICH DESIGNATES MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS BONE MARROW DONATION AWARENESS MONTH. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM NOT KNOWN AS BE THE MATCH HAS FACILITATED BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS THROUGH A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF VOLUNTEER DONORS. UNFORTUNATELY 70% OF PATIENTS SEEKING A DONOR DO NOT HAVE A FULLY MATCHED DONOR IN THEIR FAMILY. AS A RESULT PATIENTS OFTEN RELY ON THE SELFLESS COMMITMENT OF STRANGERS FOR A CURE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT I'M LIKE BLOOD DONATION PATIENTS SEEKING A BONE MARROW DONOR ARE MOST LIKELY TO MATCH SOMEONE WHO SHARES THEIR ETHNIC BACKGROUND. THEREFORE INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE BONE MARROW DONATION REGISTRY IS ESSENTIAL. ACR SEVENTY WAS INSPIRED BY FIVE YEAR OL NOR GRATZ LAZARUS WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A RARE GENETIC DISORDER CALLED FANCONI ANEMIA AND IS CURRENTLY SEEKING A MATCHING BONE MARROW DONOR. THIS RESOLUTION WILL RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS TO JOIN THE REGISTRY WHICH IS CRITICAL TO FINDING A MATCH FOR NORA AND OTHERS IN NEED. I'VE JOINED THE REGS I HAVE JOINED THE REGISTRY AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN IT AS WELL -- THE REGISTRATION IS PROCESS IS REALLY SIMPLE YOU REGISTER ONLINE AT JOIN DOT BE THE MATCH DOT ORG.

AND IN SOME CASES THOSE PLANS GET CHALLENGE BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IN THE LAW WHAT HAPPENS TO DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SECRET CHALLENGE. SO WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT IF YOU'RE UNDERLYING COMMUNITY PLAN IS CHALLENGED IN COURT AND LET'S SAY A JUDGE ISSUES A STAY ON THE PLAN. IF A PROJECT HAD BEEN DEEMED COMPLETE OR APPROVED BEFORE THE JUDGE PUT THAT STAY IT CAN STILL PROCEED WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE OF PEOPLE OF SEVERAL ISN'T THAT WHAT HAPPENS.

HOUSE RESOLUTION THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH RELATIVE TODAY OF A TEACHER. SMITH YOU MAIL BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. I RISE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HR THIRTY RECOGNIZING THE DAY OF THE TEACHER. ALL OF US HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH A TEACHER IN OUR LIVES. WE KNOW WHAT THOSE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN. AND THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE THAT A TEACHER CAN MAKE. WE RECOGNIZE AMONG OUR OWN ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES A NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHOSE THOUGHTFUL PRESENCE IN OUR BODY ADDS SO MUCH TO OUR WORK. BUT YET IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE. SO THIS RECOGNITION SERVES AS THE START. OF A WEEK IN WHICH TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE CELEBRATED WITH FLOWERS AND LUNCHES AND DECORATED CLASSROOMS AND THOUGHTFUL NOTES FROM STUDENTS AND THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE. HOWEVER THE CURRENT CONTEXT FOR TEACHERS REMAINS A CHALLENGING. ONE COLLEAGUES WE STILL REMAIN IN THE BOTTOM TEN STATES IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW WE NOT ACKNOWLEDGE WE GRAPPLE WITH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR STATE TEACHERS. EVEN UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA MANY DISTRICTS AND THEIR BY THEIR TEACHERS PERSEVERE DOING MORE WITH LESS. THEY'VE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF TRANSITIONING TO THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS PURSUING MODELS OF TEACHING COLLABORATION AND DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS WHICH GO TO THE VERY HEART OF ELIMINATING OUR STATE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. UNDER A NEW AND MUCH MORE RIGOROUS ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. THEY REACH OUT TO WELCOME AND INTEGRATE STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE LEARNING NEEDS INTO THEIR CLASSROOMS OFTEN OFFERING INSTRUCTION THAT IS UNIQUE AS EACH CHILD THEY SERVE. AND THEY UNDERTAKE ALL OF THESE TASKS WHILE BEING COGNIZANT OF THEIR SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN INSPIRING THEIR STUDENTS LOVE OF LEARNING. AND CREATIVITY. TEACHERS ARE EVER VIGILANT ON THE FRONT LINES WERE SO MANY OF OUR SOCIETAL CHALLENGES AND FIND MORE THAN EVER THEY ARE THE CRITICAL LINK IN CONNECTING THEIR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO SERVICES TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND THEIR GREATEST NEEDS. AND THEIR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. AND IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR WORK WHERE WE AS A BODY CANNOT LET THEM FALL SHORT. WE MUST MOVE FORWARD IN SEEKING THE MEANS TO ENSURE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND CHILD CENTERED SUPPORT ARE AVAILABLE IN EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND ALLOW TEACHERS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE CRITICAL LINKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. WE MUST RECOGNIZE IT AS WE FACE A LOOMING TEACHER SHORTAGE WE MUST DO MORE THAN EVER. TO ELEVATE THE PROFESSION. TO HONOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR TEACHERS AND CONTINUE IN OUR QUEST TO IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN OUR STATE SO THAT TEACHERS NO WE HAVE THEIR BACKS. LET US RAISE OUR COLLECTIVE VOICES TODAY IN RECOGNITION FOR THE COMPASSION HEART. AND FEARS HARD WORK OUR TEACHERS BRING TO THEIR WORK. AND START THIS WEEK OF CELEBRATION FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE TO OUR STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SMITH. SEEING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE HOUSE RESOLUTION.
