THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS IS A TOP PRIORITY PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE PLAN TO DO EVERYTHING WE NEED TO TO ENSURE A COMPLETE COUNT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE ORGANIZING EARLIER THAN EVER BEFORE WITH MORE FUNDING AND BETTER COORDINATION THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. THE STATE IS INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR OUR REGION EDUCATION AND HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES. THE STATE IS INVESTING -- WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CENSUS DIRECTOR DID ESCHATOLOGY AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY SECRETARY. MARIBEL BATTER.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE HEARINGS TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO GET EVERYONE COUNTED. TWENTY TWENTY WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE OF THIS DECADE TO GET THIS RIGHT. WE HAVE ONLY THREE WEEKS LEFT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO COMPLETE ITS BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR pTIME WITH THE MAN'S ON LEGISLATORS IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER UP BERMAN AND AT SENATOR UP PAN FOR IT FOR COMING TOGETHER TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IN MY ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. AND I KNOW THAT NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT SO MANY NON PROFITS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THAT TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS CLOSELY. ON THE CONVERSATIONS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE RISEN -- FROM POTENTIAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN SOME THAT THE NONPROFIT SECTOR HAS BEEN FOLLOWING CLOSELY TENTATIVELY AT TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD. I LIKE MANY OF YOU AND MANY COLLEAGUES AND REPRESENT. DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SOME AREAS THAT ARE HARD TO COUNT -- AND THOSE -- THIS THOUGH SINCE THE TRACKS ARE NOT UNIQUE BUT THEY'RE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR EXAMPLE I IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT TO HAVE THE ISLA VISTA AND THE THAT YOU SEE SP COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG INDIVIDUALS AND WHO. AT MIGHT BE UNDERCOUNTED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT IN TWENTY TEN THEY WERE UNDERCOUNTED AND WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE DISTRICTS WHERE THAT REPRESENT AND IN ONLY 6280% OF THOSE I HOUSEHOLDS ME INTERNET CONNECTIVITY THRESHOLDS SO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE GET INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT MOST. AND NEED THE INFORMATION BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED AND DESERVE TO BE COUNTED WE'VE HAD PASSED CHALLENGES AND AS I'VE IDENTIFIED AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TWENTY TWENTY WERE SEEN THAT WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES I'M AND ROAD BLOCKS. AND THAT HAVE BEEN PUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IN THAT MEANS THAT THE ROLE OF ALL OF US AS A LEGISLATURE AS MEMBERS AS LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN TODAY'S CONVERSATION ARE GONNA PLAY AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ROLE AND I IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE NONPROFIT SECTOR WHO HAS THE CAPACITY TO TOUCH LIVES IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA RURAL URBAN SUB URBAN. AND IS REALLY AN ENTITY THAT -- CAN HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGE CHALLENGES AT THE FOURTH LARGEST -- EMPLOYER -- ARE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTO NON PROFITS TO BE ABLE TO AT WORK WITH US AND TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING AND HEARING FROM OUR PRESENTERS FROM OUR PANELISTS FROM COLLEAGUES A IN OR AS WE PREPARE AND AS A STATE TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ROLL OUT. A THE CENSUS OR OUTREACH WORK THAT WE PLAN ON DOING AND IN COLLABORATION WITH NONPROFIT AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. BUT NEXT WE HAVE I THINK SENATOR PAT WHO IS GOING TO OPEN UP AND SAY SOME WORDS AND SO THANK YOU SENATOR. A THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH A GOOD MORNING -- FIRST OF ALL WELCOME EVERYONE HERE WHY THINK -- GOV OPS FOR YOUR INVESTMENT IN MAKING THE CENSUS A SUCCESS AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY I ALSO I THANK ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS. TO OUR TRAVEL TO MAKE TIME TO BE HERE SO WE CAN BE EDUCATED ON SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARDS. AND HOPEFULLY -- AVOID LOT THAT FALLS IS -- SO MEMBER -- CHAIR BERMAN SAID THAT WE HAVE WELL BASICALLY YOU HAVE ONE SHOT EVERY TEN YEARS ON THE CENSUS -- IT'S ALSO EXCITING SEE SO MANY PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THE CENSUS EFFORTS AND I THINK ALL THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS HERE AND TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING ONLINE. NO I CAME FROM THE NONPROFIT SECTOR ICE -- AND CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF THE UNITED WAY BOARD HERE IN -- AND AND SACRAMENTO SERVED ON OTHER I ALSO SERVED ON A FIRST FIVE COMMISSION AS WELL AND I KNOW THE IMPORTANT ROLE NON PROFITS -- PLAY AND I'LL BE TRUSTED MANAGE OUR TRUSTED MESSENGER SO THE COMMUNITY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT S. SOME MEMBERS AMOUNT AND PASS USE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON NONPROFIT SECTOR REACHED OUT TO CENTER BERMAN AND I SAY THAT WE NEED TO EARLY ON HAVE THIS HEARING AND TALK ABOUT THE ROLE. NOT PROFITS CAN PLAY AND NO SOONER BERMAN I HAVE BEEN HAVING MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE REACH OUT TO BE SURE WE CAN GET EVERYONE TOWN IN ONE OF THOSE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WE DO NEED TO BE SURE THAT.

MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT ABOUT THIS I EVEN RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A COURT CASE AROUND THE QUESTIONS THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WHICH I WAS NOT RESEARCH STAND AS INDICATED AND SEEMS ARE. AND DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED SO FAR THAT THERE MAY BEEN POLITICAL MOTIVES BUT ULTIMATELY ARE THE FOUNDERS OUR COUNTRY -- BUT IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT WE NEED TO THE CENSUS EVERY TEN YEARS AND WAS VERY CLEAR THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE COUNTED FOR THE CENSUS. AND SO IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO BE SURE RESOURCES AND FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO NON PROFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SMALLER NON PROFITS AND CAMILLE LEADERS -- WHO MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE ONES THAT? HAVE THE KIND OF SERVE. FISCAL CAPACITY THAT USUALLY INTERFACES OF GOVERNMENT BUT HAVE THAT CREDIBILITY WITH A VERY POPULATIONS THAT WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BUILD THOSE BRIDGES BETWEEN -- IN THE CENSUS WHICH IS AN OPERATION FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHETHER STATE GOVERNMENT WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH LARGE NONPROFITS THEN WITH THE WITH AT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WORK OUT AS WE APPROACH HOW THE CENSUS AND TWENTY TWENTY SO PROUD AND I CONTINUE BE ENTHUSIASTIC CLAP OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE.

FOR LA COUNTY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF TODAY'S CONVERSATION. SO IN TERMS OF CROSS SECTOR COORDINATION LOCALLY REGIONALLY STATEWIDE THAT'S BEEN THE CORNERSTONE PRISON CAMP IN THE COUNTY OF LA AND IT STARTED WITH THE LOCAL UPDATED CENSUS ADDRESSES. WE GOT EIGHTY EIGHT CITY PARTNERS TO COLLECT THEIR ADDRESSES WE ACTUALLY PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY CONNECT LABS WHO WORRY HELPED US ORGANIZE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY DEPARTMENTS IN UNIONS. TO FIND THE NON STANDARD ADDRESSES PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN BASEMENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN TRAILERS WERE LIVING IN A NON STANDARD UNCONVENTIONAL WAY. AND WE WERE ABLE TO COLLECT OVER FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE NONSTANDARD ADDRESSES JUST WITHIN FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE HARD TO SURVEY BLOCK GROUPS. AND THAT WAS DONE WITH THE F. -- EFFORT AND SUPPORT OF OUR OFFICE OF IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WHOSE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ARE EFFORT IN LA COUNTY RESULTED IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDRESSES BEING SENT TO THE US CENSUS BURKE BEYOND NEW ADDRESSES TO BE CONSIDERED. TO BE ADDED. ADDITIONALLY AT THE LAST JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE I SPOKE ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE AN ANTELOPE VALLEY CONVENING AND WE DID PULL IT OFF -- WE PARTNERED AGAIN WITH C. C. AFTER. TO DO THAT AND SAC STATE PROVIDED US WITH THE MATERIALS AND THE CENSUS DIRECTOR CAME ALONG WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU NO WAY OUT. AND SEE PAN ARE -- SINCE ITS POLICY ADVOCATES SEEN THAT ALSO LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNERS UP IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY SO WE ARE VERY ENGAGED IN. CREATING THESE PARTNERSHIPS. SO WE HAVE THREE COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES ARE COUNTY WIDE OUTREACH COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE IS CO CHAIR WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND WHAT WE HAVE THERE IS THIS -- A SEVERAL SUBCOMMITTEES ONE BEING A STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY TABLE WITH C. PAN. THROUGH THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT AND SUPPORTED BY CCF AND IT IS A GROWING NETWORK OF CBS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH A WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE SOUTHEAST LA COLLABORATIVE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENTS A STRATEGIES. ANOTHER GROUP WE WORK WITH OF COURSE ARE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES AND WE WORK WITH THEM THROUGH OUR COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS. ANOTHER SUBCOMMITTEE IS HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH WAS MENTIONED HERE EARLIER. WE HAVE ORGANIZED COMMUNITY STATE AND YOU THE UC LA AS WELL AS PRIVATE. UNIVERSITIES TO PARTICIPATE BOTH ADMINISTRATORS AND STUDENTS ARE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO REACH STUDENTS AND STUDENTS ARE THE HARDEST TO COUNT POCKET ONE OF THE HARDEST CAN'T POPULATIONS. NATIONWIDE. AND THE GOAL IS TO NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO COMPLETE THE SURVEY BUT ALSO VOLUNTEER AS CENSUS GOODWILL AMBASSADORS MOVING FORWARD. ANOTHER GROUP THAT WE'VE ENGAGED THIS LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS THEY COVER THIRTY ONE OF OUR COUNTY CITIES. THEY ALSO HAVE PRESCHOOL ADULT EDUCATION AND NUMEROUS OTHER PROGRAMS WE ARE TYING IN WITH THEIR WE ARE ONE PROGRAM WHICH WAS FOR THEIR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING A DISTRICT WIDE STRATEGIES AND WE HOPE TO SHARE EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN LA COUNTY. SO THAT THEY HAVE A MENU OF OPTIONS TO SELECT FROM IN PROMOTING THE CENSUS. ANOTHER GROUP THAT WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH IS SEIU THAT SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE AND THEY ARE EAGER TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND WE ARE JUST STARTING TO ORGANIZE AROUND BUSINESSES IN CHAMBERS. AND ONE FINAL GROUP THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH STARTED TO WORK WITH OUR UNIVERSITIES AND MEDIA -- TO BEGIN TO CREATE A VOICE AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS AND ACHIEVING A COMPLETE CAO. PART TWO OTHER COMPLETE CAO COMMUNITY CARE COMMITTEES EXCUSE ME OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION. THEY FOCUS AND BRING FOR TO THE FOREFRONT THE PERSONAL BENEFITS A PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS. ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL WE TALKED BY WEEKLY WITH THE CITY OF LA WITH SACRAMENTO SAN MATEO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE WHY CONVENIENCE AND THEN THE SWORD MAPPING TOOL DEVELOPMENT. WITH STUDENTS BEING ONE OF THE HARDEST TO SURVEY POPULATIONS WEAVING GAUGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND A DISCUSSION TO SUPPORT PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ADDING AN OPT IN IN COMPLETING THEIR REGISTRATION. DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS TO COMPLETE THE CENSUS SURVEY AND WE'RE HOPING WE GET YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT. HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION IN OUR STRATEGIES. SO THE COMMON STRATEGIES I'M GONNA TELL YOU IS START NOW AND DEVELOP A COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR COUNTIES AND PARTNER WITH YOUR STAKEHOLDERS. BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE MAPPING TOOLS THAT TELL YOU WHERE THE HARD TO SURVEY POPULATIONS ARE WE'RE USING THE STATEWIDE AS THREE BASE MAPPING TOOL THAT WE ALSO USE BY BLOCK GROUP. AND WE WANT TO PARTNER AND WE ARE PARTNERING WITH CCC'S CBO'S AND NGOS. ON THE SOARED SYSTEM AND WE'RE DOING A AND ADOPT A BLOCK GROUP PROGRAM. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON HARD TO SURVEY POPULATIONS BY GEOGRAPHY WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ALSO POPULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADOPTED. THAT MAY NOT BE IN A GEOGRAPHY SUCH AS NATIVE AMERICANS VETERANS AND LGBTQ COMMUNITIES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS AND FILLING GAPS WITH OUR SENSES GOODWILL AMBASSADORS ARE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERS MOBILIZING COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN UNIONS. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING SECT CENSUS ACTION KIOSKS TO PROVIDE OUR POPULATIONS WITH THE VENUE WITH IN LANGUAGE INFORMATION TRANSLATION SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING THE SURVEY. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE TRAIN. OUR CCC'S R. CBO'S ARE EMPLOYEES AND OUR AND NGOS IN OUTREACH MESSAGING. SO THINGS THAT WE WANT TO AVOID IN DUPLICATING OF APRS IN AVOIDING GAPS WE WANT ALL BE USING THAT SORT SYSTEM. TO LOCATE OUR SENSES ACTION KIOSKS AND TO LOCATE OUR C. BE ADOPTED BLOCK GROUPS. AND THAT'LL HELP US AVOID UP CREATING GAPS BECAUSE IF THERE ARE GAPS WE WILL FILL THOSE IN WITH MUNICIPALITIES UNIONS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ONE AREA I WOULD LIKE YOU FOLKS TO CONSIDER ADDRESSING GOING FORWARD ALONG WITH US IS THE DEVELOP DEVELOPMENT OF A MECHANISM. THAT SHARES THE CENSUS BUREAU THE STATE THE CBO'S AND NGOS RESEARCH AND DATA FROM VARIOUS FOCUS GROUPS AND OTHER TESTING METHODOLOGIES TO HELP ESTABLISH THE SURROUND SOUND MESSAGING AND POOLING OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES. THAT RESONATE WITH HARD TO SURVEY POPULATIONS. IF YOU OR YOUR STAFF WOULD LIKE ADDITIONALINFORMATION ABOUT LA COUNTY I'D BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE ON THE PANEL TO TAKE THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS PLANNING EFFORT TO THE NEXT STEP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THINKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS PARK -- MS POND. UP THAT MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY'S HEARING FINANCING DREW UPON I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE OFFICE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS PRETTY SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WE ARE A POLICY GRANT MAKING DIRECT SERVICING CLIENTS OFFICE THAT PROVIDES OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IN IMMIGRANT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECTS -- WE WORK WITH LOW INCOME PUBLIC HOUSING AND IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WE OPERATE THREE PUBLIC PRIVATE NONPROFIT INITIATIVES THE SAN FRANCISCO PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP DREAM SFL A SHIP AND A COMMUNITY AMBASSADORS SAFETY A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. MANY OF THESE PROJECTS INVOLVE FROM OUR WORK DURING THE TWENTY TEN CENSUS WE ARE A ONE OF ABOUT TWENTY IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS OFFICES IN THE COUNTRY WE COORDINATE WITH OTHER CITIES AND STATES. AND WE WILL BE OVERSEEING THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS EFFORT FOR SAN FRANCISCO LIKE MANY JURISDICTIONS SEPARATE CISCO HAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES HIGH DENSITY HIGH NUMBER OF NONTRADITIONAL AND RECORDED OR LOW VISIBILITY HOUSING. WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS IN THE STATE AND NATIONALLY. A ONE IN EVERY THREE RESIDENCES EVER. ON THE LEVEL OF DIVERSE CITY WITH SIGNIFICANT -- CONTRIBUTIONS FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NEARLY HALF OF OUR POPULATION SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AT HOME IF YOU ADD TO THAT OVER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THERE'S A HUGE DIGITAL DIVIDE PARTICULARLY FOR SENIORS LOW INCOME. MONOLINGUAL LDAP HOUSEHOLDS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OUR APPROACH TO THE SENSES FOCUSES ON STREET SMART RELEVANT GRASSROOTS OUTREACH CLOSE COLLABORATION AND CROSS SECTION WITH THAT OF CROSS SECTION OF BOUGHT CITY NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED FOUNDATION BUSINESS EDUCATION LABOR PARTNERS. PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT AND REFLECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND TWENTY TEN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN DIVIDED THE CITY INTO EIGHT HARD TO COUNT AREAS WITH TARGETED APPROACHES IN EACH WHILE CONDUCTING A CITY WIDE GENERAL STYLE SENSES CAMPAIGN. WE FORMED A DIVERSE TWENTY FIVE MEMBER CROSS SECTOR COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE THAT COORDINATE WELL WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE MANY. COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES PERFORMED ACROSS THE CITY FUNDING WAS COORDINATED WITH FIVE LOCAL FOUNDATIONS IN THE CITY PROVIDED NOBODY HAD ANY MONEY OUT IN TWENTY CHEN. SO WE PROVIDE AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TEMPLATES UP THE HOPE FOR DEEP GRANTS R. P. AND CRITERIA. A WEEK QUARTERLY TRAINING SESSIONS AND MONTHLY EVENTS PARTNER WITH OTHER BAY AREA CITIES AND COUNTIES AND FOUNDATIONS ARE MAPPING ASSURING TRACKING TOOLS TO MONITOR RESPONSE RATES BY CENSUS TRACTS ALSO THIS MAY SOUND LIKE AN ANTITHESIS TO THE CENSUS BUT WE TRY TO BUILD A SENSE OF FUN AND PURPOSE. OUGHT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS REAL RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE SO WE APPLIED CREATIVITY TO THE OUTREACH FOR INSTANCE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT. COMMUNITY GROUPS PARTNER ON A PHOTO NOVELLA THAT START SOME OF OUR OWN EMPLOYEES AND IT REACH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THEY ALSO HELD A SOCCER MATCH. THAT ATTRACTED OVER ONE THOUSAND CENSUS PARTICIPANTS IN A SINGLE EVENT INTO TENDERLOIN ONE OF THE SMALLEST GRANTS ARE NOT SUPPORTED AND INFO BOOTH AT THE TET FESTIVAL WHICH DREW. TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS WE USE OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO DEPLOY OUR OWN GROUND CREW OF A HUNDRED TWENTY RESIDENTS TO CONDUCT DAILY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION FOCUSING ON PUBLIC HOUSING SRO AND SECTION EIGHT RESIDENTS. WHO REFLECT AT THE ACTUAL POPULATION THAT WE WERE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO A LARGELY IMMIGRANTS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN A AND THAT TINO COMMUNITIES THE CHINA TOWN OF THE FEW AREAS TWO OF THE HARDEST? TO COUNT AREAS OF THE CITY IMPROVE BY 10% OR MORE IN THEIR RESPONSE RATES -- AND THIS WAS DIDN'T EXCUSE ME ALL DUE TO THE WORK OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE TRANSFORM THE TO FIELD TEAM INTO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ONGOING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. POST SENSES A DOZEN OF THE WORKERS ARE STILL WORKING TODAY AND EMPLOYED FULL TIME AS CITY EMPLOYEES OTHERS THIRTY OF THEM ALL OVER THE CITY WORKING HOT SPOT. TRANSIT BUSINESS UP QUARTERS OF THE CITY SO BY INVESTING ARE LIMITED DOLLARS IN EFFORTS IT DIDN'T DUPLICATE THE MAINSTREAM. OF MASS MEDIA EFFORTS AND OUTREACH BY THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WE WERE THE ONLY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA WHOSE PARTICIPATION RATES REMAIN STEADY AND APPROVED AND ALL EIGHT HARD TO COUNT. AREAS A WE WERE EVER BUILT ON THAT -- EFFORT AND THE TURNED THE SIONIS SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES SO CONCLUSION -- STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING RESOURCES AND TRAINING AT THE FRONT END AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT GRANT FUNDS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL EFFORT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT GAPS AREAS THE STATE THEATER UNDER COUNTED UNDER RESOURCE AND THAT REGIONAL LOCAL AREAS TAYLOR DE APPROACHES FOUNDATIONS CAN BE HELPFUL IN DETERRENCE SEARCHING GETTING RESOURCES TO AREAS WITH THE LEASE. CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO FILL GAPS ARE AND FINALLY WE HOPE THAT THE STATE'S PLAN WILL ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE THEIR OWN COORDINATED TARGET LARGE SCALE GRANTS EFFORT. WE NEED STATE FUNDS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND TO TRAIN CITIES AND COUNTIES OUT WHO ARE KEY POINTS OF COORDINATION YOU HAVE TO HELP THE LOCAL PRESENT LICK LINKING PRESENTS LINKING THE EFFORT -- AND TAILORED APPROACH IS AN HOUR AND SHARING INFORMATION BEST PRACTICES WITH OTHER COUNTIES SO SAN FRANCISCO WILL BE ALLOWED LAUNCHING OUR COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE AND GRANTS PROGRAM IN NEXT MONTH. OUR FOCUS IS ON TECH AND DIGITAL APPLICATIONS TRAINING MULTI LINGUAL MULTICULTURAL AND NONTRADITIONAL OUTREACH WE ALREADY HAVE THAT OUR YOUNG RAPPER IDENTIFIED TO BE THE FACE OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY SENSES. A WEEK AT FORT TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE ON THIS EFFORT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND WITH THAT MONTH TURNED OVER TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEY HAVE THE PANELISTS A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND AND YOU BOTH UC IT TOUCHED UPON THIS A LITTLE BIT -- IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS BUT NOT. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS BOTH FOR YOU'VE LEARNED? THEN PRIOR ATTEMPTS AND ALSO JUST THE HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED TE MEASURE AND OR THE KIND OF TOWARDS MEASURING AND REPORTING THE REACH IMPACT -- IN AREAS OF NEED IN YOUR AVERAGE EFFORTS SO HOW. YOU KNOW. THIS STATE IS VERY EAGER TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND WERE ABLE TO GET A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BUDGET THE MAIN THING THAT I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES LAWS ADVOCATING FOR THAT INCREASE FUNDING WAS HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT. WERE ACTUALLY TRACKING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THE EFFORTS AND CHANGING TACK IF NEED BE IF IF EFFORTS ARE INEFFECTIVE -- SAID. ANY THOUGHTS OR ADVICE YOU HAVE ON ON HOW TO DO THAT. SO WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IS WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT O IS OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND THEIR INDICATING TO US WHAT AREAS THEY CAN COVER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AS WELL AS THE CITIES. ARE WHERE LITERALLY GONNA BE MAPPING THE BLOCK GROUPS THAT THEY CAN COVER AND WHERE WE HAVE GAPS FORGET IDENTIFY THOSE EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN GET. THE KIND OF VOLUNTEERS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW COUNTY EMPLOYEES ARE CITY EMPLOYEES IN PLACE TO FILL THOSE GAPS -- OR WHETHER THEY'RE ANY NEW BREEDERS THAT ARE HIRED THREE THE CENSUS BUREAU ALTHOUGH. THOSE AYE ENUMERATORS DO REQUIRE A CITIZENSHIP WHICH IS NEW CORRECT WELL IT'S DIFFERENT FROM LAST. YEAR. LAST TIME THERE WAS A WAIVER SO YEAH BASICALLY -- YEAH WE REALIZE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE OTHER RESOURCES AS WELL SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE LITERALLY. GOING THROUGH -- EACH OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM BY BLOCK GROUP TO MAKE CERTAIN WE HAVE COVERAGE CREDIT. UP DURING THE TWENTY TEN SENSES WE DID APPLY NUMBER OF METRICS AT THE FRONT END OF OUR EFFORT M. OUT PARTNER ITH OTHER CITIES BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME CAPACITY YOUR RESOURCES. AND WE USE A COMMON TRACKING TO WILL SO WE EIGHT WERE ABLE TO MONITOR RESPONSE RATES BY CENSUS TRACKS IN EACH OF OUR AREAS AND IN ANY TIME YOU DID AN ACTIVITY TO SEE IF THAT. THERE WAS AN UP TICK IN OF THE RESPONSE RATE FOR THIS TYPE OF GO AROUND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THEM EMPLOY OTHER -- NOT ONLY THAT EFFORT BUT MY SUGGESTION TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE STATE IS MAKE GOOD FRIENDS WITH YOUR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE MY LIFE SAVERS YOU KNOW THEY DID A LOT OF THE DEEP DIVE INTO THE CENSUS TRACTS TICKET TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE. WE NEED IT TICKLE SO WE COULD DEPLOY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO THOSE PARTS OF THE CITY WHERE WE KNEW WITH THE RESPONSE RATE WAS IN A WORKING -- SO I THINK HAVING TECHNOLOGY TRAINING YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ALL DIGITAL US CENSUS THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS WE HAVE. FOR THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS OF THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SMARTPHONES THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE INTERNET OR CABLE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT REALISTIC WAYS. TO HELP THEM PARTICIPATE AND THOSE ARE. REALLY HELPFUL WITH I WILL HAVE OUR OWN LOCAL TO LOSE BUT IF THE STATE COULD FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN TRAIN US ON INVEST IN THAT THAT WOULD JUST BE A LIFESAVER [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AND AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT YOU FOR YOU KNOW BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE HARD TO REACH UP POPULATIONS? THE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT AND THAT TECHNOLOGY. HOW WILL HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE DUPLICATIONS I'M WITH [inaudible] PARTNERS RIGHT SO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOUR ORGANIZATION IS THE NET YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW WHAT CENSUS TRACKS YOU'VE BEEN TO AND YOU HAVEN'T HOW DO WE ENSURE -- I'M OF OF APPROACH THAT DOESN'T OFFER DUPLICATION WHEN WE REALLY NEED THAT COUNT TO BE SUPER ACCURATE. SO LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT IS TRYING TO COORDINATE OTHERCBO'S. SO -- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY WHICH IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING I'M JUST GEOGRAPHICALLY -- AND ALSO WE HAVE URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG CHARGE FOR THEM. BUT THEY SO FAR HAVE BEEN LEAST FORTY FIVE GROUPS AND I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE HUNDREDS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN TWENTY TEN AND BY THE TIME THEY WERE DONE -- A PULLING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS CBS AND THEY'D HAVE HAD -- STRONG SUPPORT FROM CCF AS A FOUNDATION AND AND I THINK THEY'LL BE OTHER FOUNDATIONS THAT WILL STEP UP TO HELP SUPPORT. THAT EFFORT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO THAT'S MORE OR LESS HOW WE ARE. GOING TO BE ATTACKING IT AND I THINK THROUGH THE STATE SORTS SYSTEM WHICH IS THIS AZRI BASED. SYSTEM I WILL BE ABLE TO GET REAL TIME RESPONSE -- AND ARE LA COUNTY -- SYSTEM IS ALSO AS THREE PLATFORM SO WE WILL BE ABLE. TO HAVE ALL OF OUR DATA MAPPED ONTO THE STATE SYSTEM AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE OUR COUNTY FACILITIES THAT CAN BE UTILIZED. FOR CENSUS ACTION HE ASKS AS WELL AS CHURCHES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SO THERE'S A LOT OF COORDINATION. BUT WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US SOME OF THE TOOLS WERE STARTING TO WORK ON AND I THINK FOR SAN FRANCISCO. YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND WE WERE UNDER COUNT IT BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS SO WE LEARN SOMETHING FROM THAT EFFORT IN. TWENTY TEN UP BY REALLY BEING REAL ABOUT OUR STRATEGY IN OUR APPROACH WE DID CITYWIDE TRAINING CITY DEPARTMENTS EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE NOT SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT IT ANY SORT OF PUBLIC CONTACT. WE TRAINED OUR OWN WORKERS WHO TRAINS OF CBO'S EVERYBODY GOT TRAINED IN THE SAME WAY UP BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COORDINATE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S GOT THESE CROSS RELATIONSHIPS THEY WORK. ACROSS THE STATE THAT WORK REGION ONLY -- AND YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY DOING THEIR OWN THING WITHOUT LETTING OTHER PEOPLE KNOW PAPER WORKING ON THIS THE FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON THE CONGREGATIONS THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO OVERLAP AND AND DO THAT. THERE'S A YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S NO MONEY LAW AT AS NONE OF US HAD IN OUR TWENTY TEN A YOU GET REAL CREATIVE AND YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR RESOURCES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY RESOURCES AREN'T REALLY THE ISSUE IS REALLY THE COORDINATION AND REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE MESSAGING THAT HITS HOME WITH PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU THINK WE HAVE A CRAPPY PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION THAT'S RACES -- AND TRYING -- TO DEFIED US OR POINT IS MAKING SURE EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN GETS COUNTED SO THAT WE GET OUR FAIR SHARE OF ALL THE RESOURCE IS THE VOICE IN THE REPRESENTATION THAT WE ARE ENTITLED. TO AND THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW LIFTING IT UP TO YOU KNOW WE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO DO THIS FOR EACH OTHER AND TO LOOK OUT. FOR EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST SORROW. TOTALLY AGREE THIS IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE IT'S A CALIFORNIA ISSUE WERE ALL PAYING TAXES AND AND WE SHOULD RIGHTFULLY GET THOSE TAXES BACK -- YOU KNOW FOR THE FEDERAL IT TO FUND THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS -- BASED ON ACCURATE COUNT IN THE FAIR COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVE HERE SO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE NEED TO MERGE WE STILL NEED TO STAY CREATIVE LIKE WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES BUT I'D LOVED HEARING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THEY THAT CAN SAN FRANCISCO IS DONE AND I'M SURE LA DID -- AND LIKE MR JONES SERVED -- MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING FUN AND AND FIND A WAY TO TO SHORE COMMUNITIES THAT EVERYBODY IS PARTICIPATING -- TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT EXISTS AND A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WITH PARTICIPATING SO. I ONE RECOGNIZES SOME NUMBER IRWIN ON WHO COMMENTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT GREAT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PARTICIPATING LOOKING FOR MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY MONTHS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND NEXT UP WE HAVE A LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS BY NONPROFITS THIS WOMAN.

AND I WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE. YOU START OFF OR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND IT'S JUST WONDERFUL THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS IS A JOINT HEARING AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER ABOUT THAT. I'M CHEN MUST FOCUS CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NON PROFITS CAO MONTH PROFITS FOR SHORT. WE HAVE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS MEMBERS WITH MEMBERS IN FIFTY SEVEN OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO WE'RE KIND OF EVERYWHERE -- NOT VERY WELL KNOWN IS THAT ONE IN EVERY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA WORKERS WORKS FOR A NONPROFIT FROM CLINICS TO PRESCHOOLS FROM INNER CITY ARTS TO THE NON HO HEALTH CLINIC. FROM THE PTA TO THE SAMOAN COMMUNITY CENTER. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA NONPROFITS BRING IN FORTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM OUT OF STATE INTO CALIFORNIA THROUGH FEDERAL AWARDS FOUNDATION GRANTS SENT IN AND INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS. EVERY DAY WE NONPROFIT SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY UNDER COUNTED THEY COME TO SEE DOCTORS AND DENTISTS IN OUR HEALTH CLINICS TO PRAY IN HOUSES OF WORSHIP TO RECEIVE PROCEEDS OF OUR FOOD BANKS TO ANSWER THE DOOR TO A MEALS ON WHEELS VOLUNTEER. BUT NONPROFITS ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO SUPPORT A COMPLETE COUNT WE ARE ALREADY THE TRUSTED PARTNERS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COME TO NONPROFIT FACILITIES EVERYDAY. FOR EXAMPLE TO NONPROFIT CLINICS TO WHOM THEY HAVE ALREADY INTERSTED THEIR HEALTH RECORDS TO IDENTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND THEIR CELL PHONE NUMBERS. THEY PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN OF OUR CHILD CARE SCHOOL PROGRAMS WE KNOW HOW TO RENT FERRIS WHEELS [inaudible] YEAH. NONPROFITS ARE ALREADY OUT IN THE BALLOT AND WORKING IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE AN UNDERCOUNT LOOMS WE ARE ALWAYS GOING DOOR TO DOOR ANYWAY AND UNDER COUNTED NEIGHBORHOODS WE KNOW ALL THE HOMELESS YOUTH BY NAMES. WE ARE IN THE SMALLEST TOWNS AND RURAL CALIFORNIA AND WERE ALREADY VISITING THE HOMELESS CAMPS THE BOARDING CARE HOMES THE FARMER FOR HOUSING. AND THE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WHEN WE DO FREE VACCINE CLINICS IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS FOR PETS CROWDS EMERGED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ALREADY IN COURT WE CAN INCORPORATE CENSUS WORKING TO OUR ONGOING ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN TO HAVE TO CREATE NEW ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ADDED ON TO OUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DELIVERING MEALS TO THE ELDERLY HANDING OUT SOCKS TO WARM HOMELESS PEOPLE THROUGH THE BACKPACKS OF THE CHILDREN IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE DO CENSUS VIDEOS AND ARTS AND THEATER CLASSES. NON PROFITS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO BRIDGE CULTURAL LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN UNDERCOUNT. WE KNOW THE LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIA WE KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEWSLETTERS WE CAN PUT UP POSTERS TAXED AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGES. ARE BOARD MEMBERS EXTEND THE REACH OF NON PROFITS. NONPROFITS CAN QUICKLY RECRUIT THOUSANDS OF ENUMERATORS FROM THE UNDER EMPLOYED PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE EAGER AND EAGER TO BE TRAINED TO DO THE JOB WELL. NONPROFIT COMMUNITY LEADERS WANT TO SERVE ON COMMUNICATING AND CITY COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES AS I DID IN SAN FRANCISCO'S TWENTY TEN COMPLETE COMPLETE CAO. WE KNOW THAT LEADERS IN UNDER COUNTY COMMUNITIES CAN BE RECRUITED TO SERVE ON THEM WHO KNOW HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN CIVIL COUGHED CIVIC AFFAIRS AND WANT TO COMPETE CONNECT. COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WHAT DO WE NON PROFITS NAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK THAT WE ARE PLAINLY QUALIFY TO DO FIRST. EVEN WHEN FALLING CENSUS OUT REACH INTO OUR ORDINARY PROGRAMS WE NEED FUNDING. WE NEED DOLLARS TO GO TO THE NONPROFITS WHO HAVE DIRECT REACH INTO THE NONPROFIT INTO BOOK THESE COMMUNITIES. NONPROFITS NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENSUS FUNDS AND WE NEED A PROCESS THAT IS REASONABLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. GRANTS TO NONPROFITS MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR INDIRECT COSTS SINCE COST INCHES INSURANCE ACCOUNTING AND HR WILL INCREASE. FUNDING NEEDS TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS WHICH ARE OFTEN NOT THE LARGE INSTITUTIONS THOSE A FOR RISEN FROM RURAL AREAS POOR COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE IMPACT STUDY BECAUSE DISCOUNT WHICH YOU'VE JUST RECEIVED SHOWED THE DISPARITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE REFLECTED IN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THERE TWICE AS MANY NON PROFITS PER CAPITA IN THE BAY AREA AS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN INLAND EMPIRE AREA. AND BAY AREA NONPROFITS HAVE TWENTY ONE TIMES. PER CAPITA MORE DOLLARS THAN NON PROFITS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE NEED ENUMERATOR JOB APPLICATIONS AND AREAS IDENTIFIED AS MOST DESPERATELY NEEDING ENUMERATORS WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE LOCAL COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN CAN RECRUIT COMMUNITY LEADERS TO SERVE ON THEM. WE NEED COLLATERAL THAT CANDIDLY DOESN'T LOOK OR SOUND LIKE A GOVERNMENT PAMPHLET THAT'S BEEN HURRIEDLY TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH OR CHINESE. WE NEED TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE NONPROFITS EAGER TO PARTICIPATE CAN LEARN DOABLE WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR EXISTING SYSTEMS AND VOLUNTEERS. IN SHORT NONPROFITS ARE READY EAGER AND UNIQUELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE CENSUS WE HAVE A KNOWLEDGEABLE ENTRUSTED REACHING TO CALIFORNIA'S UNDER COUNTY COMMUNITIES BUT NO ONE ELSE CAN CLAIM WE LOOK FOR TO THIS CHALLENGE. I'M UNDER TIME EVEN. CAME HERE. EFFICIENCY AT ANOTHER ONE VERY EXAMPLE FIND EFFICIENCY OF A NONPROFIT WORLD. THANK YOU GENESIS. WELL DONE GOOD MORNING AND ONE OF THE S. -- IS THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND ARE FOR HER. FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND OUR MANY COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR STRATEGY. FOR ENSURING A COMPLETE COUNT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT HOW TO BEST DEPLOY YOUR VALUABLE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE. WE AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH POPULATIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THAT ACCORDING TO PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS. AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY CENSUS UNDER COUNTING LOSE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR. AND FEDERAL FUNDING. BUT WHAT'S AT STAKE IS AN ONLY FEDERAL FUNDING. OR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT APPORTIONMENT. WHAT'S AT STAKE IS THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF GOVERNMENT TO BE A FORCE FOR EQUITY IN OPPORTUNITY. HOW THE MOMENT IN HISTORY WHERE THE VERY QUESTIONS OF WHO IS HUMAN [inaudible] WHO BELONGS? WHO DESERVES A SHARE OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ARE BEING CONTESTED? AT A TIME OF INCREASING DIVISION AND ANXIETY DRIVEN BY THE DEMONIZATION OF ONE ANOTHER. BEING ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS SENDS A POWERFUL MESSAGE ABOUT WHO MATTERS. WE C. THE SENSES IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WHO ARE OTHERWISE OUT OF RELATIONSHIP. AND TO REBUILD THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT AWAKENS PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER'S HUMANITY. WE'VE DEVELOPED A FIVE PRONG STRATEGY TO ENSURE COMPLETE COUNT IN [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY NUMBER. ONE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND GOAL SETTING. WE SEEK TO INVEST IN UPGRADING OUR TECHNOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT A DATA COLLECTION AND TRACKING SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS US TO A EFFECTIVELY TARGET NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL CENSUS OUTREACH. BEACH TRACK OUR PROGRESS OVER TIME. C. RECRUIT VOLUNTEERS. AND DE COMMUNICATE REGULARLY WITH RESIDENTS AND HARD TO COUNT HER HTC COMMUNITIES. NUMBER TWO GRASSROOTS CANVASSERS. WILL RECRUIT AND TRAIN THOUSANDS OF GRASSROOTS CANVASSERS AND VOLUNTEERS FROM HTC COMMUNITIES. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE MESSENGER IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE MESSAGE. NUMBER THREE BILL COMMUNITY ORGANIZING CAPACITY. WE SEE THIS CENSUS IS A KEY OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON GOING ORGANIZING CAPACITY TO ENSURE RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE YEARS AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY ARE REACHING AND BENEFITING FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. NUMBER FOR LAUNCH A MASSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING CAMPAIGN. WE WILL DEPLOY CANVASSERS AND VOLUNTEERS TO ENGAGE IN AS MUCH FACE TO FACE RELATIONAL OUTREACH HOUSE POSSIBLE. AND NUMBER FIVE THE AIR GAME. WE MUST EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP MESSAGING AND EDUCATION MATERIALS THAT SPEAK TO DIVERSE CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE GROUPS AND HTC AREAS. WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED AND CENSUS MESSAGE PRODUCT OF RESEARCH PROJECTS IN ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES AND THE INLAND EMPIRE. SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE. NUMBER ONE PRIORITIZE RELATIONAL OUTREACH. PROFESSOR HARI HONEY UC SANTA BARBARA. HAS FOUND THAT RELATIONAL ORGANIZING IS FORTY TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN COLD CALLS. WE'VE LEARNED TO OUR VOTER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TARGET VOTERS AND POTENTIAL VOTERS AND HTC COMMUNITIES. THAT THE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE IS COUNTER INTUITIVELY. NOT TO LEAD WITH THE CONVERSATION ABOUT VOTING. BOTH RATHER A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ABOUT IMAGINING A BETTER FUTURE. THE SAME APPROACH SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE CENSUS. NUMBER TWO TRAINING. STATE FUNDING SHOULD SUPPORT EXPERIENCE TRAINERS WHO KNOW HOW TO TEACH CANVASSERS THE PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY BASED RELATIONAL EQUITY BUILDING. AND WHO HAVE PRACTICED. THE GOAL IS NOT TO DRIVE THE BIG TRANSACTION WERE NOT LOOKING FOR SURVEY COLLECTORS. NUMBER THREE RECRUITMENT. CANVASSERS SHOULD BE RECRUITED FROM ORGANIZATIONS WITH A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL RELATIONAL OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE. NUMBER FOUR AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED A ROBUST OUTREACH AND EDUCATION COMPONENT TO START IN EARLY. TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S SORT OF GET READY FOR THE CENSUS CAMPAIGN. WHICH PLOWS THE GROUND FOR THE CANVASSERS ONE CENSUS FORMS BECOME AVAILABLE IN. TWENTY TWENTY THIS PRIMING THE PUMP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE CANVASSERS WORKING. TWENTY TWENTY NUMBER FIVE CONTRACTING. BASED ON LESSONS FROM THE CONTRACTING IN MOST CASES SHOULD GO THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S NOT CITIES AND COUNTIES. BECAUSE CBS HAVE A BETTER GRASP ON THE NONPROFIT LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGAIN IN MOST CASES. ALSO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CBO SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONEROUS AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] NUMBER SIX DESIGN AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ONGOING COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS EFFORT THAT WILL REQUIRE CLOSE COLLABORATIONS ACROSS SECTORS INCLUDING WITH PHILANTHROPY. SECOND TO LAST NUMBER SEVEN PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION OBTAINED EVEN IF IT MEANS LITIGATION. AND LASTLY RESOURCES. MORE RESOURCES WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED. WE APPLAUD THE STATE'S NINETY MILLION DOLLAR INITIAL INVESTMENT IT'S MORE THAN THE STATE HAS EVER INVESTED. AND IT'S LIKELY NOT ENOUGH OUR CALCULATIONS WITH C. PAN YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALREADY SHOW A MINIMUM OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION WILL BE NEEDED JUST FOR CBO OUTREACH ALONE. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL NINETY FIVE MILLION BEYOND THE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION RD ALLOCATED CBO OUTREACH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. IN THE COMMENTS. NOT SO. ONE QUESTION I HAVE -- THAT HE E. BOTH TOUCHED UPON THIS BUT BUT ARE THERE. ARE HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED EFFORTS YET [inaudible] CHIU -- IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN TAKING PART. THERE ARE TAKING THE TEST TO BECOME FEDERAL CENSUS -- EMPLOYEE NEW ENUMERATORS AND AND WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR A HOW TO RECRUIT THOSE FOLKS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE TRAINING THEY NEED JUST TO GET THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. LET ALONE ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB. HARM WELL EVERY SINGLE DAY IN ALMOST EVERY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN COMMUNITIES WE SEE UNDER EMPLOYED PEOPLE MIGHT JUST UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BUT OFTEN UNDEREMPLOYED PEOPLE MAKE THE MOST READY TO TRAIN -- ENUMERATORS AND HOT AND NONPROFITS ARE JUST DYING TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO PEOPLE HERE TAKE THIS TEST FILL OUT THIS FORM. YEAH I WOULD ADD THAT COME WE HAVEN'T YET STARTED ARMED RECRUITING FOLKS TO BE EMPLOYED BY THE CENSUS BUT CERTAIN WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO VOLUNTEERS ABOUT VOLUNTEERING WITH THE SENSES AND BEING A PART OF THE ARMY OF CANVASSERS THAT GOES OUT INTO COMMUNITIES. THESE ARE FOLKS FROM CONGREGATIONS FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FROM SCHOOLS IN THESE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US SINCE AT LEAST. TWENTY TWELVE DOOR VOTER ENGAGEMENT WORK. AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE CENSUS WORK BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS US TO TALK TO EVERYONE AND HEARTY CAN COMMUNITIES NOT JUST REGISTERED VOTERS ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGISTER YOU CAN. THYROID GET CARRY. SO I HAVE A BIT OF A CONCERN WHEN I LOOK AT THE BY RURAL COMMUNITIES -- MANY THE REAL COMMUNITIES OF AN BEEN -- LA FIRES. AND WE ARE LOSING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT AND THE NONPROFITS ARE UNABLE TO PROBABLY PICK UP -- DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE CAN WE GET ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY. DO THE CENSUS FORCE I'M REALLY CONCERNED IS THAT -- THE POPULATION THERE I DON'T THINK SING IT NECESSARY COUNTY. I THINK THAT NAUNTON ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF NONPROFITS IS THAT WERE IN EVERY COMMUNITY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER EVEN OUR MEMBERS ARE IN FIFTY SEVEN OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND OUR MEMBERS WHO WERE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AS YOU KNOW ARE ALWAYS STRIVING AROUND -- FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SO THEY'RE ALREADY REACHING A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO DO THAT. AND AS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY KNOW A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ANNA AGAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO THE FOOD BANKS AND OTHER THINGS. AYE THEY KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AND GLAD TO DO THIS WORK OF ENUMERATION. AND I THINK THAT SO I ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT WE SAW IN THE TWENTY TEN COMMITTEE IN SAN FRANCISCO JUST BE ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND NONPROFITS RECRUITING ENUMERATORS NOW THAT'S AN URBAN AREA. BUT I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE GROUND COMMUNITY NONPROFITS THAT DID THAT RECRUITING FOR APPLICATIONS THAT I THINK WE ARE MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN SOME OTHER AREAS. JUST JUST ONE THING I THINK A LOT OF THE OTHER PHILANTHROPY AND LARGE NONPROFITS I TEND TO BE IN THE METRO AREAS. AND AND SO I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT OUR ABILITY TO TO BE IN EVERY COUNTY WE JUST HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY FROM ALPINE COUNTY WILL BE IN -- FIFTY A REALLY GIVES US A UNIQUE ABILITY TO AT THAT OUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON THE AREAS OUTSIDE THE METRO AREAS WHERE THERE'S LESS REACH FROM OTHER PEOPLE. AND I WOULD DECIDE ON THAT IN A BEAT SENSE TWENTY TEN THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE INVESTMENT AND BUILDING COMMUNITY ORGANIZING CAPACITY IN RURAL AREAS SO. IN TWENTY TWENTY IT'S ALMOST NIGHT AND DAY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND IN PLACES LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE INLAND EMPIRE CUT AND THE NORTH VALLEY OF SACRAMENTO -- THIS YOU KNOW DEL NORD HUMBLE COUNTIES KIND OF THE BORDER WITH OREGON SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AS WELL BASED UPON SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO FIND. THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE -- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN WE HAVE TO START NOUN IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD -- YOU BOTH OF YOU MENTION IS THE IDEA THAT. THIS WORK NEEDS JUST BEGIN NOW AND AND WE THERE'S ALSO A CONFIDENCE AND THAT WE CAME HIGHER -- OR BRING ONBOARD VOLUNTEERS TO DO THIS -- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE DOING NOW WHO WHY YOU HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE I GUESS FROM MY LANDS. I'M THINKING WE NEED TO DO MORE NOW -- WE NEED TO HAVE A POOL OF THE IRA. OF INDIVIDUALS READY TO GO SET TO APPLY APPLYING FOR THE NEWMAN OR AN INTEGRATOR POSITIONS I'M ALSO KIND OF JUST YOU KNOW A BENCH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO DO THIS WORK WHAT ARE NON PROFITS DOING. RIGHT NOW TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT INDIVIDUALS -- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT WE SHARED A BY MR MCKELLAR. ABOUT OR THOMAS NUCLEAR -- ABOUT THE PROFESSOR WHO SAID THAT. FORTY TIMES MORE IT'S FORTY TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP THAN JUST TO HAPPEN ASK -- AND IN A IN A APPRECIATE THAT SO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. YES SO I AM WE ARE A PART OF THE TABLE CALLED THE MILLION VOTERS PROJECT WHICH IS MADE UP OF SOME OF THE LARGEST STATE NETWORKS OF CBO'S AND NONPROFITS IN THE STATE -- WE ARE WE HAVE KIND OF IN ORGANIZING PRESENCE AND LOCAL -- ORGANIZING CAPACITY IN THREE QUARTERS OF THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE BEEN GROWING OUR CAPACITY TO REACH VOTERS PRIMARILY IN THESE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES. THIS YEAR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILL BE OUR FOURTH CYCLE OF WHAT'S CALLED AND KIND OF OUR OUR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. AND SO ON AND SO WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF TAKING FOLKS THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAM SENSE. TWENTY TWELVE IN THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF RELATION BASED ORGANIZING -- PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO GOING DOOR TO DOOR INTO SCHOOLS INTO CONGREGATIONS INTO BUSINESSES WHERE PEOPLE IN HEARTS CAN'T COMMUNITIES LIVE AND WORK. CONTACT HAVE DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT THE KIND OF CALIFORNIA THEY WANT TO PASS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN. AND WE FIND THAT THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BASED FACE TO FACE INTERACTIONS ARE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE ANECDOTALLY AND THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS IT -- THAT PROFESSORS FROM UC SANTA BARBARA IN YOUR DISTRICT. MOM SHE'S SHE'S BEEN RESEARCHING COMMUNITY ORGANIZING SHE'S AMAZING -- AND SO WHAT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT ONCE THE ENUMERATOR KIND OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND SORT OF LIKE THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS BEGINS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE WORD OUT TO A LOT OF FOLKS. PARTY COME EQUIPPED WITH A SET OF SKILLS THAT WE NEED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. I AGREE WITH THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY A NUMBER OF VARIOUS ASKING TO HELP RECRUIT PEOPLE FOR COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE ARE DOING -- THE BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF WE HAD THE MATERIALS NOW WE COULD START TOMORROW. WE HAVE THE APPLICATIONS FOR ENUMERATORS TODAY WE COULD SEND THEM OUT TOMORROW WE COULD START SENDING THEM OUT WITH PEOPLE. NOT JUST THE ORGANIZING ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW LIKE PICO LIKE VOODOO GREAT JOB BUT ALSO WITH THE KIND OF THE HUMAN SERVICE DELIVERY IN THE ARTS ORGANIZATIONS. AYE THAT HAVE A REACH INTO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY AS WELL. THANK YOU. FOR HOW ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION GOD I'M LIKING ON BECAUSE I HAD IT A MINUTE AGO. SO YOU ALL ARE THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO THE COMMUNITIES IN AND THE CLOSEST -- TO TO THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ONE THING IS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH FOLKS ABOUT THE CENSUS AND INCLUDING ITS IN THE CAN MEETINGS THAT THE THE THAT THE STATE ORGANIZED. WAS JUST THIS INCREDIBLY HIGH LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT EXISTS IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT PARTICIPATING -- AND AND ONE CONVERSATION PRETTY WHO WAS WITH LEADERS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY -- WHO YOU KNOW? EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS I TRIED TO TO REPLY THEY SAID WE KNOW BUT STILL I CAME BACK WITH YOU KNOW OTHER DO ALL THE TALKING POINTS I HAD I EXHAUSTED THE LIST OF TALKING POINTS I HAD. AND THEY SAID WE KNOW BUT WE'RE STILL NOT COMFORTABLE AND I SO WHAT WILL YOU NEED TO HEAR TO BE COMFORTABLE AND THEY SAID WE DON'T KNOW YET. BUT ONE THE ONE WE HEAR IT ARE YOU IN A DO YOU HAVE ANY. ANSWER HERS -- ERROR OR HAVE YOU I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- THAT YOU WORK WITH ON WHAT DOES RESONATE WHAT DOES KIND OF GIVE PEOPLE THE IN THE COMFORT THAT THEY NEED -- TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS. WELL I THINK JOSEPH'S POINT ABOUT RELATIONS SOME MONEY YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE MEDIA IS ABOUT ANXIETY ABOUT THE CENSUS. WE ARE NOT EMITTING MESSAGES RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE POSITIVENESS. OF THE CENSUS AND AS A RESULT I THINK THAT BY OVER PLANE ANXIETY WERE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED ANXIETY ABOUT IT. WE ARE VERY LATE IN GETTING OUT THE MESSAGES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS HIVE SAFETY OF THE CENSUS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. YEAH I I WOULD I WOULD REINFORCE THAT POINT I THINK THAT WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO STILL AND THEN BUILDING THE TRUST THAT WE NEED WITH. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS -- WE THINK THAT YES AS I SAID EARLIER THE MESSENGER IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE MESSAGE JUNE -- BUT THE MESSAGE IS GONNA MATTER AS WELL AND SOME OF THAT IS BEING. EXPERIMENTED WITH AS I MENTIONED THROUGH A A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION -- IS IS FUNDING THE OTHER THING -- IS -- I'VE SPOKEN TO A FEW FOLKS IT'S IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE INFORMATION COLLECTED OR IF STATE DOLLARS ARE USED TO HELP COLLECT INFORMATION FROM FOLKS PARTICIPATING THE CENSUS IS PROPRIETARY IN SOME WAY TO THE STATE. THAT THE STATE CAN LIKE USE THAT AS LEVERAGE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE PRIVACY. AND TO KNOW THAT THE STATE IS IS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN LAWSUITS ISN'T AND ANY KIND OF POWER THAT THE STATE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THEIR INFORMATION IS PROTECTED I THINK THAT WILL GO SOME WAY. ONBOARD STILL ALSO LEARNING A LOT ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE AND AND AGAIN IT JUST REINFORCES THAT THE THE POINT ABOUT STARTING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ABSOLUE THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE LOOK FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS -- OVER THE NEXT TWENTY MONTHS -- IT SOON NEXT WERE AND MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL THE ROLE OF FOUNDATIONS. IN SUPPORTING A COMPLETE COUNT IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE WITH US MARICELLA RODRIGUEZ SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA. ENDOWMENT NANCY JAMISON PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE SAN DIEGO GRAHAM MAKERS AND A FRYING IN ESCOVEDO VICE PRESIDENT EDUCATION AND IMMIGRATION AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND A MEMBER OF THE STATE'S COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU -- ALL THREE OF YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY -- AND WHAT WE GO LEFT MY LEFT TO RIGHT MARICELLA IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN GET OFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I'D LIKE TO START BY THINKING THAT YOUR PERSON LIMON. PERCENT PAN AND AND TO PERSON BERMAN FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER AND CONTINUING AYE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN HELPING US THINK THROUGH HOW BEST TO LEVERAGE THE NINETY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TOWARDS A COMPLETE COUNT -- AND ALSO LIKE TO NOTE -- THAT LIKE MANY OTHERS I PLAN TO BE HAS ALSO BEGUN A COORDINATION UPPER FACILITATED THROUGH GRANT MAKERS CONCERNED WITH IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. OF WHICH THE ENDOWMENT SERVES AS A CULTURE ROBERT IT WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE HARD COUNT POPULATION -- AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE STATE PLANS TO LEVERAGE THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WILL HELP ALL PARKING PARTNERING FOUNDATIONS FINALIZE OUR STRATEGIC PLANS SO THERE IS A LOT OF EAGERNESS AN URGENCY IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE STATE PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND WE'RE PREPARED TO COMPLEMENT IN SUPPORT AND FILL IN THE GAPS SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY IN DISCUSSIONS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WILL THERE BE PLANNING DOLLARS FOR ON THE GROUND GROUPS WHAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE AVAILABLE WE'LL COMMUNICATION FUNDING. IS LIKELY OF THE CALIFORNIA A CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY FUNDERS INITIATIVE CONTINUES TO CREATE ITS QUOTA PLAN TO ALIGN PHILANTHROPIC FUNDING WHILE THE STATE DETERMINES THE PURPOSE AND MECHANISMS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC DOLLARS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE STATE'S ACTIONS WHILE WE INITIATE SHORT AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE IMPACT WE PRIORITIZE TOGETHER. I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED. UP FROM OUR TWENTY TEN EVALUATION PERSON SAYS -- SOME STRAINS THAT WERE INTO IDENTIFIED INCLUDED EFFECTIVE AND FAR REACHING CANVASSING ACTIVITIES USE THE MEDIA TO REACH CERTAIN ISOLATED POPULATIONS TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO PROMOTE SENSES PARTICIPATION. A COMMITMENT TO COOPERATION AND COORDINATION AMONG MANY GRANTEES I WOULD FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY OUR ORGANIZING NETWORKS IS A RESOURCE TO REACH THE HARD TO COUNT. THEY ARE AUTHENTIC VOICE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE TO ACHIEVING A SUCCESSFUL COUNT. AT THE ENDOWMENT WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS LOCALLY ON THE GROUND AND YOU YES YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER TODAY WERE. A SUPPORTING OUR INTEGRATED VOTER ENGAGEMENT PARTNERS ARE A FOURTEEN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES SITES AMONG OTHER PARTNERS. AND YOU MAY ALSO HEAR -- FROM -- MY COLLEAGUES JUST THE IMPORTANCE AND CONSIDERATION TO GIVE -- YOU KNOW THE FLEXIBILITY. OF THE NONPROFIT SURE -- AND HOW WE POTENTIALLY HAVE YOU CONSIDERED GRANTS VERSUS CONTRACTING -- ON THE COMMUNICATIONS SIDE BECAUSE THIS IS A KEY AYE ELEMENT TO PAST EFFORTS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH THE ENDOWMENT SEES AS AN IMPORTANT AS AN IMPORTANT -- THIS IS SIMILAR I EFFORT -- WHERE WE CAN TAKE LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE SENSES UP LINDEMANS MEDICAID ENROLLMENT EFFORTS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE INVESTED IN DIRECT OUT REACH WE MATCHED IT WITH PAID MEDIA? BUILDINGS SURROUND SOUND TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF THE ELIGIBLE BUT AN INSURED INCLUDING MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR MEDIA. AND I APPRECIATE THE OTHER EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT THINKING OUT OF THE BOX AND AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE. WITH AND TODAY OR IN THE FUTURE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID TO GET OUR CREATIVE AND DO THINGS OUT OF THE BOX WHICH INCLUDED THINGS LIKE PARTNERING WITH BARBER SHOPS AND TACO TRUCKS AND STREET TEAMS AND CHURCHES AND OTHER THINGS -- IT AS PART OF OUR OVERALL COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS WE CREATED A SPANISH MEDIA PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF ETHNIC MEDIA TO ENSURE WE WERE REACHING A DIVERSE AUDIENCE. THE ENDOWMENT WILL ONLY HAVE A SMALL FRACTION OF THAT INVESTMENT FOR THE SENSES. OF PHILANTHROPY WILL SUPPORT THE SENSES IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT A GAP IN P. MEDIA AS LIKELY TO REMAIN. AS WE DID WITH OUR EASY IF EFFORTS WILL BE INVESTING IN MESSAGE TESTING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND BARRIERS TRUSTING MESSENGERS AND MESSAGING TO* ACCOUNT POPULATIONS. MESSAGE TESTING IS ALSO AN AREA WHERE FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS ARE COORDINATING AND SHARING INFORMATION. STARTING EARLY A YOU KNOW JUST EMPHASIZING THE POINT THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY -- STARTING EARLY IS CRITICAL -- WE NEED TO START NORMALIZING THE CENSUS AND GIVEN THAT TWENTY TWENTY IS AN ELECTION YEAR WILL BE A MORE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. BUT TO START EARLY AND TO HELP US NOISE -- SOME NOTES ON GRANT MAKING WE UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC DOLLARS COME WITH HIGH ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT FLEXIBILITY BE MORE MAYBE MORE CHALLENGING WITH CONTRACTING SO AGAIN. CONSIDERING -- GRANTS OVER CONTRACTING WHAT WE ALSO LEARN FROM TWENTY TEN IS THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP DOLLARS AVAILABLE. FOR THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW PERIOD SO THAT HOTSPOTS AREAS THAT HAVE LOWER RESPONSE SCORES CAN BE REACHED BY TRUSTING PEOPLE WHEN ENUMERATORS ARE GOING OUT TO KNOCK ON DOORS. CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE -- AND NONPROFITS ME LATITUDE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO REACH THE GOAL THEREFORE THE STATE SHOULD SHOULD AND CAN'T PLAN FOR FLEXIBILITY AND BILL THAT ENTERS CONTRACTS AND GRANTS. AT THE OUTSET. IF THERE'S A PLAN TO COLLECT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE AGGREGATED ACROSS THE REGION OF THE STATE THIS NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A NECESSARY. BUDGET PERSONNEL COSTS AND A REPORTING PLATFORM MUST BE STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR USERS TO USE. ALSO CONSIDER MULTI YEAR FUNDING THIS GIVES PARTNER SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY TO PLAN A POTENTIALLY STOP STOCK UP OR DOWN -- AND LASTLY I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IT MAY BE HELPFUL -- TO BUT TO TOUCH BASE WITH FOLKS LIKE COVER CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THAT UNDERTAKING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JACOBS MS AARONSON. MADAM MINISTER CHAIR SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY UP COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. BEFORE YOU TODAY ON THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE THAT WILL SHAPE OUR SHARED FUTURES. MY NAME IS NANCY JAMESON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF PHILANTHROPY CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SAN DIEGO GRANT MAKERS WERE IN THE PRESIDENT AND CEO. THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS IS A ONCE IN A DECADE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON THE WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND RECOGNITION OF THE IMPACT THAT IT. IN ACCURATE CENSUS WOULD HAVE ON CALIFORNIA ARE THREE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH OUR ALLIANCE HAVE EMBARKED UPON FULLY SUPPORTING A FAIR AND ACCURATE CENSUS COUNT. AS REGIONAL MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATIONS WE CONVENE PHILANTHROPY WITH OVER SIX HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE FAMILY COMMUNITY AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS CORPORATE GIVING PROGRAMS GRANT MAKING PUBLIC CHARITIES AND INDIVIDUAL DONORS. PHILANTHROPY IS INVESTING IN THE CENSUS BECAUSE OF ITS CRUCIAL ROLE IN SHAPING AND FORMING PUBLIC POLICY. THE CENSUS PRODUCES DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT GUIDES THE ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL RESOURCES AND FAIR POLITICAL REPRESENTATION FUNDERS RELY ON THE CENSUS DATA. TO INFORM LONG TERM PLANS AND GRANTS BY LEADING DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS BUT WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE SOME FUNDERS EMPLOYEE CENSUS DATA TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY NEEDS. DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND GAPS IN SERVICES. AS YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS INCLUDE CHILDREN BETWEEN ZERO AND FIVE URBAN AND RURAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT IMMIGRANT AND MIXED STATUS FAMILIES AND SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS THESE OUR POPULATIONS THAT PHILANTHROPY CARES ABOUT. WE KNOW THAT MANY HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FILL OUT THE CENSUS DUE TO THE INCLUSION. OF THE NEW QUESTION ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS THAT ASKS ABOUT US CITIZENSHIP. THIS SCARE TACTIC WILL RESULT IN UNRELIABLE DATA FOR THE NEXT DECADE AND AFFECT THE STATE'S FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL RESOURCES. GLAD TO BE IS ALSO INTERESTED IN THE CENSUS BECAUSE THE RESOURCES THAT THE CENSUS BRINGS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND CAL CENSUS INFORMATION GUIDES SEVENTY SIX BILLION FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE STATE WHICH I'M AMOUNTS TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. THESE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID SNAP S. CHIP. WICK AND HOUSING VOUCHERS. TWO LARGE SCALE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS LIKE HIGHWAY PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION. FUNDERS ARE HAPPY AND GRATEFUL THAT THE STATE IS INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE CENSUS. PUBLIC DOLLARS WILL BE VERY VALUABLE TO ALL SECTORS THE RECEIVE SUPPORT TO ENSURE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT. WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM PUNTERS IS THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IS SOMETHING THEY'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AS THEY MAKE PLANS TO INVEST IN THE CENTERS THEM SO DOLLARS CANNOT REPLACE GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THE CENSUS FROM THE FLAT. CRITICAL NEED FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE. THUNDERS YOU'RE LOOKING TO THE STATE. PARTICULAR SUPPORT EFFORTS IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE MAJOR CITIES SUCH AS CENTRAL VALLEY INLAND EMPIRE AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND OTHER REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE WELL SITUATED TO SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY HUBS TO BEST LEVERAGE STATE RESOURCES. BECAUSE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE FLAT TO BE HAS TACKLED SEVERAL EFFORTS TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE COUNT. WE HAVE JOINTLY OPPOSE THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S REQUEST AT CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. AND FLAT B. HAS A KEY ROLE TO PLAY AND LEVERAGING ITS INFLUENCE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND DOLLARS TO YIELD A FAIR COUNT. CONSEQUENTLY PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED THE CALIFORNIA CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY FUNDERS INITIATIVE PLAN. THIS INITIATIVE COORDINATES FUNDING ACTIVITIES AMONG FOUNDATIONS AS WELL AS FOCUS IS ON HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS. WE COLLABORATE WITH AND RELY ON TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE LOCAL OUTREACH IN THE COUNTIES. THIS INITIATIVE ALSO SUPPORTS A PLANNING OF INDIVIDUAL REGIONAL HUBS AND HOW THEY COORDINATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH STATEWIDE EFFORTS. LOCALLY THE BAY AREA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SAN DIEGO HAVE ALREADY OR WILL LAUNCH REGIONAL CONVENIENCE AND EDUCATION ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LOCAL FUNDERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE TO LEVERAGE BOTH PUBLIC AND PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT EACH AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN IS COUNTED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISS REST BETTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HONORABLE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES COME BEING CARE FOR THIS JOINT HEARING MY NAME'S FY MESCALERO I'M VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY REGARDING THE ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY AND SUPPORTING NON PROFITS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THIS JOINT HEARING COULD NOT BE TIMELIER IS CALIFORNIA'S COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A STATE WHITE PLAN FOR DEPLOYING THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. OF NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT A COMPLETE COUNT FOR CALIFORNIA. SIMILARLY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AS WE'RE LEARNING TODAY HAVE BEGUN TO LAY OUT MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS FOR EFFORTS TO EDUCATE. ACTIVATE AND ASSESSED HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED RISKS FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE TWENTY TWENTY SENSES THE AND PRESIDENTE INVESTMENT OF NINETY MILLION BY THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. CAN HOW. FIGHT AGAINST ONE OF THE LARGEST UNDERCOUNT OF CALIFORNIANS IN DECADES HOW WHEN WHEN WE ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS WILL DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IT'S A PLACE SPACE FOUNDATION SERVING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION THE FOUNDATION HAS SERVED. OF THE COMMUNITIES OF LA FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS OUR MISSION IS TO HELP BE POSITIVE SYSTEMIC CHANGE TO STRENGTHEN LOS ANGELES FOR ALL. BUT ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE FOUNDATION HAS SET ACHIEVING A COMPLETE COUNT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS AT THE TOP PRIORITY OVER THE NEXT. TWO YEARS SPECIFICALLY ENSURING THAT EFFORTS TO SUPPORT HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES AND POPULATIONS ARE FULLY RESOURCE. WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE AND WITH LOS ANGELES BEING THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COMMUNITY IN THE NATION THIS HERCULEAN GOAL WILL REQUIRE FULL COORDINATION AND THE OBVIOUS SUPPORT OF THE STATE. MONARCH TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY AND IN THE COMPANY OF OTHER COMMITTED PARTNERS IN PHILANTHROPY. YOU'VE HEARD TODAY A NARRATIVE OF COMMITMENT COORDINATION AND DESIRE FOR COLLABORATION FROM OUR SECTOR. WITH MY REMARKS I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION BY SHARING SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES. OF HOW ARE COORDINATION HAS HELPED MORE LOCALIZED EFFORTS IN LA COUNTY. PROVIDING THE STATE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TO CONSIDER AT THE STATE'S COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE DEVELOPS A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT PLAN. SINCE THE START OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE STATE. CALIFORNIA FUNDER GROUP. THAT'S BEEN REFERENCE HERE TODAY IN THIS CHAIRED BY THE JAMES IRVINE FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. OUR GROUP NOW GOING TO OVER THIRTY FOUNDATIONS OF LOCAL AND STATE AND WITH VARYING MISSIONS IN PRIORITIES HAVE ALIGNED WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF A COMPLETE COUNT. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE GROUP'S CURRENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FROM MY COLLEAGUE MONEY SELA AT THE ENDOWMENT. AND ABOUT OUR GOAL TO ENSURE STRONG ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT STATE AND LOCAL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL PHILANTHROPY HAS PLAYED A SUPPORTING ROLE IN EARLY SENSE HAS EFFORTS IN LARGE PART THANKS TO OUR WORK TOGETHER. AS A FUNDERS GROUP. AND NOW LAY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER PARTNERS LIKE THE WEINGART FOUNDATION HAVE BEEN WORKING AT A LOCAL LEVEL. WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND CITY TO SUPPORT THESE PLANNING EFFORTS TO DATE. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITYFOUNDATION HAS INVESTED NEARLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT JUST PLANNING AND LOCAL RESEARCH EFFORTS. THIS SUPPORT IS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING. HELPING TO CONVENE WITH THE CENSUS POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK A LOCAL REGIONAL GROUP OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS NOW FORM THING CALLED REFERRED TO AS THE ALLEY CENSUS REGIONAL TABLE. PROVIDING THE ALEX CENSUS REGIONAL TABLE PLANNING GRANT TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY DRIVEN OUT REACH PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE. INVESTING IN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FIELD AND OPINION RESEARCH GRANTS DEDICATED TO DEVELOPING BASELINE DATA ON HARD TO COUNT DEMOGRAPHICS. THIS WORK IS ALSO HOPING TO INFORM THE WORK OF THE STATE'S MESSAGE TESTING WORKING GROUP. BEING AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE COUNTY CITY COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE TO WHICH MEANS WE REGULARLY ATTEND. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE DECISION TO SUPPORT PLANNING AND RESEARCH WAS A PRODUCT OF OUR COORDINATION WITH STATE FUNDERS AS IT'S WHAT SET AT THE TOP. EARLY PRIORITY FOR OUR PHILANTHROPIC INVESTMENT. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THAT STATE. HUNG THIS THAT THE STATE WOULD DEVELOP ITS PLAN FOR INVESTING SETS ITS FUNDING I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THIS BE THIS PLAN. BE CENTERED ON HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES IN POPULATIONS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DESIGN. OUR EFFORTS AROUND THE EXTREME USER. FIRST WE WILL. AROUND THE EXTREME USER FIRST WE WILL ACHIEVE A TRULY INCLUSIVE EFFORT. AND THE LAST PART OF MY REMARKS I'D LIKE TO REITERATE AND AT TO THE PRINCIPLES WE HAVE SHARED WITH YOU TODAY. OUR DESIRE IN SHARING THESE PRINCIPLES IS TO SHAPE THE PRINCIPLES THE STATE WILL ADOPT. IN IT STATEWIDE PLAN SO FIRST. STRENGTHENED DON'T JUST STRETCH THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. PHILANTHROPY HAS LEARNED THAT NONPROFITS ARE PRECIOUS RESOURCE THAT NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINED AND NOT JUST DEPLETED FUNDING SHOULD TAKE CARE TO ENSURE THAT AFTER YOUR PROJECT WE ARE LEAVING A STRONGER RESOURCE BEHIND FOR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. TO FUNDING SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS IS A MULTI FACETED ENDEAVOR. THIS MEANS HAVING A RANGE OF ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT ROBUST OUTREACH. INCLUDING LOCAL ICE COMMUNITY RELEVANT RESEARCH. CAPACITY SLASH INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COALITION BUILT COALITION BUILDING ACTIVITIES. DIRECT CONTACT IN RELATIONAL ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES AND ALSO NARRATIVE BUILDING A DEEPER COMMUNICATIONS WORK BEYOND I JUST ADVERTISEMENT. THREE PROVIDE AGILE FUNDING WOULD RECOMMEND GRANTS NOT CONTRACTS ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR CLEAR DETAILED GRANT AGREEMENTS. AND ALSO IN THIS AGILE FUNDING TO ALLOW FOR MORE ROBUST SET. PARTNERS THAT CAN BE FUNDED GRANT SHOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY THAT RECOGNIZES THE ENVIRONMENT IS SHIFTING AND ORGANIZATIONS MUST CREATE. AND INTEGRATE CENSUS WORK INTO THEIR EXISTING COMMUNITY WORK IT'S THROUGH THIS WORK THAT THE TRUST WE NEED REALLY EXIST AND FINALLY. BE COLLABORATIVE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH REPORTING ANY EVALUATION DATA WILL ABOUND FROM MANY SOURCES AS WE'VE HEARD. BEING OPEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE NEED AND CAN SHARE ONE ENSURE WE HAVE A FULL PICTURE OF OUR PROGRESS IN NEEDS. I HOPE THAT OUR PRESENCE HERE THIS MORNING DEMONSTRATE PHILANTHROPIES ENGAGEMENT AND DESIRE TO COORDINATE. I AM PARTNERING I URGE YOU TO BE SPEEDY AND SHAPING THE STATE PLAN A WELL INFORMED PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR WILL HELP TO AMPLIFY AND EXPAND OUR COLLECTIVE IMPACT OF THE STATE. HOWEVER IT WILL BE HARD TO PLAN IF DETAILS OF THIS INVESTMENT ARE UNCLEAR OR DELAYED WE'RE HERE TO WORK FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS LONG THANK YOU I THINK YOU IT'S IT'S BEEN A GREAT TO HEAR ALL THREE PANELS AND THERE'S DEFINITELY 驮MENTS THEMES THAT YOU'VE ALL KIND OF SHARED IN THERE'S ELEMENTS. AND THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS NOW HAVING HEARD ALL THREE AND YOU THREE HAPPENED TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE HERE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION -- BUT SO IS THAT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF OF OF ERROR IT TONE OF KIND OF THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MADE A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT -- AND I HEARD. IT KIND OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND GOVERNMENTS MAKE A CASE AS TO WHY. THEY ARE INEFFECTIVE AND ENTITY TO KIND OF TAKE ON SOME OF THE FUNDING I HEARD THE NON PROFITS TO THE SAME AND I'M HEARING FOUNDATIONS DO THE SAME. SO NOW MY QUESTION IS IS A WHAT. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO IS THE RIGHT? WHERE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO MAKE THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AND WHO IS NOT -- SO NOT JUST HERE'S WHY THE FOUNDING WOULD BE GREAT WELL WAIT A GREAT PLACE TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT BUT HOW DO WE KNOW. WHERE IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT AS WELL? RIGHT OUT CERTAIN ASSURE THAT I'M. THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE PLACE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT SO THERE'S A ROLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PLAY WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE WORKING HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES I THINK WHAT YOU'LL HEAR SOME OF US SAY -- AND AND HOPEFULLY BUILD UPON IS I'M. OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR FUNDING. IS BASED ON DECADES OF RELATIONSHIP BUILDING WITH NONPROFITS UNDERSTANDING THOSE NEEDS AND AND BUILDING AND SUPPORTING. OTHER SUCCESS AT WORK AND THOSE COMMUNITIES SO I'M AS FAR AS TO WHO TO FIND THEM WHERE TO PUT IT I THINK IT'S ABOUT. WHERE IS THERE ARE GENUINE COMMUNITY DRIVEN ENGAGEMENT AND THEN WORKING WITH PHILANTHROPY TO UNDERSTAND -- WHO ARE NONPROFIT PARTNERS THAT WE MAYBE DON'T SEE IN IN OUR AYE FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT BUT I WOULD SAY THE REASON A LOT OF IT FOCUSES BACK TO THE STATE IS BECAUSE IT ALL BEGINS WITH THE TEMPLE THAT THE STATE SETS? IF THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ARE PUT INTO VERY RESTRICTIVE CONTRACTS ONE WE GOTTA TRY TO WORK AND ENGAGE NONPROFITS WE WILL BE HAVING. TO INVEST RESOURCES TO HELP MITIGATE AND HAVE THEM MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS VERSES HOW DO YOU EXPAND AND DEEPEN YOUR WORK AND SO. IT'S IT'S TAKING THE STATE'S LEAD IN THE SENSE THAT THE WAY THAT THESE GRANTS IN THIS MONEY GOES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. WALL EITHER HELP US TO AMPLIFY AND EXPAND THE WORK OR CAN SORT OF CREATE A HINDRANCE FOR US WHERE WE PUT OUR MONEY. SO A LOT OF IT IS LAST ON DIRECTING WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT THE MONEY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS NONPROFIT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT MORE ON HOW YOU STRUCTURE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO DICTATE. HOW NONPROFITS PERFORM AND HOW WE CAN THEN LEVERAGE THAT TO BUILD UPON THAT MORE I HOPE THAT? KIND OF ADDRESSES [inaudible] SOME AMERICAN. SURE ARE GONNA. THIS IS A CROSS SECTOR PROBLEM THE MINUTE WE ALL OF US NEED TO STEP UP AND DO OUR PART -- AND BUT THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THE NONPROFITS TO THE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REFERENCED HERE MANY TIMES ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE ENERGY OF THE RESOURCES THE WORK IS REALLY CAN BE DONE AND COMMUNITY -- ON A PHILANTHROPIC PERSPECTIVE WE CONVENE -- INVEST AND THAT YOU KNOW LEVERAGE YOU KNOW COMING HERE WITH THE STATE GOES THERE AND PLAY SOME ACTIVATION ROLE -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT. YET ACTIVATED SO HERE WORSE HAVE A TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP IN THE PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR IS HERE TODAY AND LARGE -- FOUNDATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS OF SIGNIFICANCE ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK HAPPEN. THERE'S MORE PHILANTHROPY OUT THERE THAT IS NOT QUITE -- UP TO SPEED ON THIS YET AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF OUR JOB AS PARTICULAR POSSIBLE TRUE AND SOME OF THE HARDEST ACCOUNT -- COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE -- AS MUCH ATTENTION LOCALLY TO THIS AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT WHEN WE GET WE ARE GOING TO DO TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES -- ACTIVATE WHATEVER IT TAKES DEPEND ON THE REALITIES IN THE NATURE OF THAT PARTICULAR PLACE I'M TO GET THE MONEY OUT ON THE ENERGY ON THE WORK DONE IN THE VOICE -- AND THE WORD OUT -- TO GET DISCOUNT DONE. NO JUST ECHO MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS AND I WOULD JUST SAY NO THAT THIS IS BOTH IN TERMS OF LIKE HOW. HOW WE INVEST BUT IT'S ALSO MULTI PRONGED APPROACH YOUR NEW NOT ONLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO GETS THE MONEY BUT HOW IT GETS DISTRIBUTED WHETHER IT'S? DIRECT ON THE GROUND OUTREACH VERSUS COMMUNICATION AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE FROM PAST EXPERIENCE WEATHERS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT HAS TO BE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT YOU THE STATE WILL HAVE. MORE RESOURCES THAN WE WILL HAVE TOGETHER SO I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW. HOW THE STATE'S LEVERAGING THOSE RESOURCES SUPPORTIVE AND COMPLIMENTARY? AND I THINK I WOULD ALSO ECHO THAT -- YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT POPULATION IN REGION AND SOME COMMENTS EARLIER THAT REMAIN -- THERE MAY BE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT AREN'T AS STRONG AS IN OTHER REGIONS AND YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THAT -- AND ALSO LOOK AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A PLACE I MAY GO UNDER INVESTED. AND THE THE IMPORTANT THING IS AND YOU'RE HEARING IT HERE TODAY IS WE'RE NOT STARTING AT ZERO RIGHT SO YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. MILLION VOTERS PROJECT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WORK ACCOUNT NUMBER THERE'S PIPELINES ON HOW YOU GET. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES INTO VERY LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR IMPACT THERE'S PIPELINES THERE'S MAJOR STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PICO CALIFORNIA CALLS ADVANCEMENT PROJECT. THAT ARE SET UP TO FUNNEL THAT WAY COUNT NONPROFITS AND SO. A KEY PART IS WE'RE NOT STARTING ZERO THERE'S ACTUALLY PIPELINE SOMEHOW YOU MOVE SUPPORT INTO THESE AREAS AND WILL BE KEY FOR THE STATE. STITCH INTO THAT AND AND WORK ITS PLAN IN THAT WAY RATHER THAN TRYING TO CREATE. OTHER WAYS. CRAIG AND I AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT EATS IN I THINK YOU HAD THE COMMENT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN EXISTING. AND INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS ARE MODELS AS OPPOSED TO CREATING NEW ONES AND I THINK THAT THAT'S I'M A POWERFUL THING I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT ALSO INTO THE ABILITY. TO TAKE THAT THESE POTENTIAL FUNDS -- AND USE THEM IN A WAY THAT'S EXPANSIVE THAT SUPPLEMENTS I'M THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEING DOING AS OPPOSED TO NEO -- AND I KNOW YOU WERE ALL VERY CAREFUL THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD GO YOU DID NOT TELL ME WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO AND SO I STILL LEAVE THAT QUESTION OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT KNOWING YOU KNOW YES WHERE POTENTIAL MONEY SHOULD GO. BUT WE'RE SHOULDN'T NAKO I THINK THAT THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE GOT PERHAPS YOU KNOW BEING. I'M A LITTLE THOUGHTFUL AND WHETHER WHERE IT'S GOING TO PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF BEING ABLE TO GENERATE. THE OUTCOMES WERE LOOKING FOR ESPECIALLY IF THE STATE CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE A GRANT VERSUS A CONTRACT MODEL AND I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN SEEN THE PUBLIC FUNDS AS WE JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE -- DEPTH IN THE MAJOR AND THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT AT THE STATE IS MAKING IS ONE THAT ON THE YIELD THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND THAT'S THE FEAR IT'S NOT THE FEAR THAT THESE NONPROFITS -- ORGANIZATIONS ARE MUNICIPALITIES WOULDN'T DO GOOD WORK WITH IT ON BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE SO MUCH AT STAKE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT THE PUBLIC THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS MAKING INTO THIS INITIATIVE YIELD SOME OF THE OUTCOMES AND THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN A IN A REALLY HARD TIME IN A TIME WHERE -- YELL A A A A JUST PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ANYONE -- KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR ASKING ANY INFORMATION I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S A STUDENTS SELLING YOU KNOW THEIR FUND RAISING THING FOR THE SCHOOL PEOPLE ARE REALLY HAS A TENT RIGHT NOW. INFORMATION OR GIVE OUT INFORMATION AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT I'M A THINK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND IT JUST ECHO THOSE THANKS I'VE BEEN SO IMPRESSED BY THE ENGAGEMENT FROM OF PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR -- AND IT WAS ALMOST A YEAR AGO THAT I WAS TALKING I'VE BEEN SET UP WITH SOMEBODY -- TO TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION ISSUES AND AFTERWARDS THIS THIS GENTLEMAN ASKED ME WHAT ELSE HE WORKING ON I SAID ALL I JUST BECAME CHAIR OF A SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CENSUS. AND AND HE SAID REALLY THAT'S FASCINATING YOU KNOW TOMMY MORE AND THEN HE SAID CAN I CONNECT YOU WITH WITH THE EXECUTOR ACTOR MY FOUNDATION IN -- MAD LOVE FOR YOU THAT TO TELL HER ABOUT IT AND SO HE MADE THE CONNECTION AND THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY REPLIED WERE ALREADY WORKING ON HE THIS IT IS HADN'T BEEN KINDA MADE AWARE OF THAT YEAH AND THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THE PHONE TOPIC SECTOR. HAS REALLY ENGAGED EARLY AT THE SAME TIME THE PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR IS SUCH A BIG SECTOR -- AND AS I TALK TO DIFFERENT FOUNDATION -- MAYBE MAYBE IT'S THE LEADERS OF THE FOUNDATIONS KNOW WHAT WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING BUT THE THE THE FUNDERS. DON'T NECESSARILY SO -- MYSTERIOUS AND YOU YOU MENTIONED HOW THERE'S A NETWORK OF PHILANTHROPY'S BETTER COORDINATING IS ARE YOU ALL ARE YOU ALL -- DOING WHAT -- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT COMING UP WITH WITH THE BIG NEEDS LIST THAT YOU SEE FROM A PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT IF AND FOUNDATIONS -- FILLING IN THOSE GAPS THAT MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THAT COORDINATION IS SORT OF THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE DO FOR BIG ISSUES ARE. IT IS -- MORE ROBUST TO MATURE IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE'S THAN OTHERS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT LOS ANGELES TODAY AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO. THOSE -- CENTERS OF PHILANTHROPY -- IN BIG WAYS IT'S A LOT OF A MAJOR FLAP IS THAT OR HAVE ALREADY CREATED TABLES ARE TALKING TO EACH OF THE STATE WHITE TABLE IS THERE'S HANGING OUT UP TOGETHER THERE AND TRYING TO COORDINATE. THAT LEADERSHIP THAT IS BEING -- HAS BEEN FORMED IS GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN AND CONNECTS TO THE REST OF THE STATE THROUGH FLAT TO BE CALIFORNIA THE ALLIANCE OF THE THREE REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE IN THE STATE OF THE OF CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE FOUNDATIONS IS HERE WE NO WE DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL THAT FUNDERS NEED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND THAT THEIR WHAT THEY DO NEEDS TO BE. DEEPLY INFORMED OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE GROUND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK SO -- THE STRUCTURE IS THERE THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE A LITTLE SOONER IN SOME PLACES AND OTHERS WHICH SOME WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE STRUCTURE. GREAT AND A AYE IF I HEARD CORRECTLY FROM FROM. MULTIPLE SPEAKERS TODAY THERE'S CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WHERE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY EXIST WITH IT THAT. DONOR DATABASE DOESN'T EXIST TO THE CBO COMMITTEE ISN'T AS STRONG AND I WRITE THAT THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A A BIG AREA OF OF KIND OF CONCERNED -- NEED -- FOR YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN FOCUS ARE THERE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT THAT YOU ALL OF IDENTIFIED. INLAND VALLEY INLAND EMPIRE IMPERIAL COUNTY OKAY. VERY HELPFUL NO -- AND CAN I ADD A LEADING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY -- ALSO HAD THE POINT ABOUT FIRE STRICKEN OR NATURAL DISASTER STRICKEN AREAS WHERE -- WE'VE LOST A LOT OF RESIDENTS IN HOMES AND COUNTING THOSE FOLKS WHO MAY BE MOVING AROUND IS MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE TO PUT ON A GREATER. THERE'S WORK GOING ON NOW WITH OUR COLLEAGUE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GRANT MAKERS THAT IS INVOLVED IN TALKING TO FUNDERS AND ABOUT THE FIRES THERE LINKING IT TO THE HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE CENSUS THEY'VE STARTED THAT WORK PERFECT [inaudible] ETHNIC. REALLY GETTING INTO. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT -- SORE GONNA MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I THINK [inaudible] NOTE [inaudible] I THINK. I'M JAN THAT'S OKAY YOU ME IF IF YOU WANT TO START OFF PUBLIC COMING BECAUSE I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO ADD. ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT. I THINK IT'S ONLY PARTLY ABOUT WHO GETS THE MONEY AND IT'S WHAT ACTIVITIES GET THE MONEY. TRADITIONALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT IN FRANCE A PM IF YOU USE THE ANALOGY OF A GUY LIKE READY AIM FIRE TRADITIONALLY PHILANTHROPY GOVERNMENT. HAVE BEEN KIND OF READY AIM AIM AIM AIM AIM. HIGH AND MAYBE WE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR MIGHT FIRE BEFORE WE TAKE CAREFUL AIM BUT I THINK IF WE DON'T HAVE TIME. TO BUILD UP INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO RESEARCH TO REVIVE DEVELOP PLANS AND THEN REVISED PLANS AND THEN REVISE PLANTS AGAIN. WE SHOULD CUT MY MY ANTI PLAN WE WANT TO DO THAT BUT WE CAN'T WAIT TO ALREADY START THE OUT REACH. ALREADY START DOING THIS WORK -- WE CAN'T WAIT AS LONG AS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SO WE NEED TO INVEST PARTLY IN PLANNING BUT MORE IN GETTING OFF THE GROUND RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A AND NEXT UP WE HAVE ELEMENT TOMORROW FROM THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER THE COUNTIES IN A CLEAR. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND SELECT COMMITTEES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND ALL THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR INSIGHTS I'M ELLIE MATSUMURA WITH THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. AND YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE FONTS BEFORE BRINGING TO THE TABLE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT UNPARALLELED EXISTING CAPACITY TO REACH OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND COUNTY EMPLOYEES THERE ARE VERY FEW RESIDENTS IN A GIVEN YEAR WHO DON'T INTERACT WITH THE COUNTY. OUR HOSPITAL ALONE PROVIDES CARE ONE IN FOUR RESIDENTS -- TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CLINIC THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS ASSESSOR CAL WORKS SNAP OF PUBLIC SAFETY LIBRARIES PARKS HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROBATION YOU GET THE IDEA NOT POTENTIAL GROWS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE -- WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WHO'S REALLY BEEN OUT ON FRONT ON THE CENSUS -- WE'VE ALREADY CONVENES THREE DOZEN TOP LEVEL CROSS SECTOR LEADERS AS OUR PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR THE CCC -- FOR SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH LAUNCH AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR STAFF AND PARTNERS THAT HUNDREDS OF NONPROFIT PARTNERS THAT WE CANNOT CONTACT WITH.

SO IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE WILL BE BRINGING TO OUR BOARD A DETAILED STRATEGIC PLAN A TO PROPOSE TO THEM FOR HOW WE LEVERAGE AND COMPLEMENT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT INCLUDES PROPOSALS FOR SOME ORIGINAL RESEARCH ON SOME SOME GAPS WE'D LIKE TO FILL IN REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW WE BEST TARGET AND REACH T. HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE PHILANTHROPY COMMUNITY ABOUT THIS AS WELL -- WE INCLUDE ROLES FOR STAFF POSITIONS AND FOR HOW WE COLLABORATE WITH.

AND IN THE GONZALEZ WHO'S GOING TO PRESENT AFTER ME I FROM SAN MATEO COUNTY AND OF COURSE DOROTHY APART FROM LOS ANGELES GOVERNMENT IS COORDINATING ACROSS THE STATE AND SO THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REASSURE YOU IS THAT. SACRAMENTO COUNTY DOES NOT WANT THE FUNDS TO DISTRIBUTE ALL THE CONTRACT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS WHY WE'VE REACHED OUT TO OUR SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY REGION FOUNDATION. AND SAID YOU ARE THE RIGHT FOLKS TO BE DOING THIS NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY IN AN ENGAGING OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY HAVEN'T ON THUS FAR FOR WHAT FOR A REGARDLESS OF OF DIFFERENT REASONS -- BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS AND AND AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS A A COMMUNITY LED INITIATIVE IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS REALLY HAS TO BE BY AND OF THE COMMUNITY CERTAINLY WITHOUT YOU KNOW WORDS GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING A IN ALL SECTORS AND CERTAINLY WORD WORRIED LEVERAGING OUR CONTRACTS AND AND OTHER WORK THAT GOVERNMENT DOES. BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE ARE SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WORK THE CENSUS IS HUGE BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT UP ON OUTCOMES THAT THEY CAN COME FROM THIS GOING FORWARD AND THEN I KNOW THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT. WHAT DID ISN'T SOARED WANTS TO BUILD BUT ARMED -- PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR REGION FOUNDATIONS WILL NOT BE DOING THE SAME THING WE ARE WALKING LOCKSTEP ARMINE ARMINE WORKING TOGETHER SUPPORTING EACH OTHER AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE RIGHT FOLKS AT THE TABLE. BUT I WANT IT WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE I'M NOT I THINK THIS OR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN'S OPENING COMMENTS IS THAT NOT ALL PARTS OF THE STATE OF THE SAME. AND WHERE OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SOME LARGER FOUNDATIONS AND HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FROM THOSE FOUNDATIONS TO BE DOING. SOME OF THE EARLY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AS THAT WAS PART OF LUKA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY SACRAMENTO WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE FOUNDATION AND AND LINDA DIDN'T MENTION IT. BUT I'VE BEEN BANGING ON DOORS AND TRYING TO CONVENE MEETINGS A WE NEED SOME FUNDING APPEARANCE SO -- I DO HAVE IN ASKING THE ASK IS WHETHER IT'S THROUGH OTHER LARGER FOUNDATIONS IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW OR OTHER FUNDING THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SPREAD THROUGH OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT LACK THOSE RESOURCES YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER BUT WE REALLY DO NEED FINANCIAL SUPPLY ARMS SUPPORT IN ORDER TO PASS THAT THROUGH TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THIS NECESSARY WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS OF THE CAPACITY SO.

AND LOS ANGELES AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AS WELL AND THE COUNTY. WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL COLLABORATION WE ALL HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS. LESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES. AS LA COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD WE'RE LEARNING FROM THAT THEY WERE WANTING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS WE CAN COLLABORATE. SENATOR COUNTIES COMPRISED OF TWENTY CITIES. 38% OF OUR POPULATION ARE IMMIGRANTS WHAT THE OVER A HUNDRED OF FORTY LANGUAGES SPOKEN. THAT TAKES STRONG COLLABORATION. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE JUST COMPLETED A CENSUS COUNT WHERE WE GOT ENOUGH. OF LOOK ABOUT CENSUS COUNT LUKA AND WORKING WITH CONNECT LAPSED VALLEY FOUNDATION THINK THAT YOU TO THEIR EFFORTS. WITH THAT WE RECEIVED A NET GAIN OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND HOMES WE DIDN'T TIRE CANVASSING OF EAST PALO ALTO. WHICH REQUIRED AND WORKED WITH OUR NONPROFITS BUT THAT AGAIN TO COLLABORATION AND THAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE COUNTIES CAN BRING.

I'M SO THAT ANY COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH I'M STRATEGIES I SHOULD REFLECT AND EMPHASIZE -- THE YOU KNOW THAT THE NEED TO COUNT YOUNG CHILDREN CALIFORNIA HAS NINE MILLION CHILDREN. OUT OF THREE MILLION OF THOSE ARE EIGHT ZERO TO FIVE I'M AND I THINK THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION TODAY BY THE DIFFERENT OUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND FOUNDATIONS -- WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THE OF THOSE -- AT FOCUS IS ON ON COMMITTEES THAT ARE HARD TO COUNT ALSO THAT WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL THAT THERE'S BEEN GREAT GRANT PROGRAMS LIKE THE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA GRANT PROGRAM THE ONE CALIFORNIA GRANT PROGRAM.

SO WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN CENSUS A EVERY DECENNIAL CENSUS FOR THE LAST FIVE DECADES AND THAT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US MANY THINGS -- SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO ONE REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- NOT JUST COMMUNITY BASED ARGUMENT NOT JUST NONPROFITS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THAT REACH AND DEPTH AND LANGUAGE SKILLS TO REACH THOSE HARDER TO REACH. SO REALLY LOOK UP LIFT THEM AS YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT FUNDING. ALSO WHETHER THAT FUNDING IS CHANNELED THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC FOUNDATIONS OR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT. THOSE DOLLARS NITA FLOW DIRECTLY TO LOCAL NONPROFIT GROUPS LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NOT AN INTERMEDIARY. AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY PORTANTINO -- TO START EARLY GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT HIS LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY HAVE TO HIRE TRAIN SCALE UP GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT AND MULTI YEAR FUNDING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WAY THERE'S CONTINUITY OF KEY STAFF THEY CAN LEVERAGE THOSE DOLLARS AND IT'S NOT A TWELFTH MONTH GRANT PERIOD WHERE THEY HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THINKING.
