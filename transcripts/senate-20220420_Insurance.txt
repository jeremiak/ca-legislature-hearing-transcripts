THROUGHOUT THE BILL MISTER CHILLAYOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY SEVEN. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBER OUTLINED. AND AMENDMENTS OF MIND IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME DILIGENTLY AS SHE HAS. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR- TO CONTINUE GOING FORWARD- BUT ADDITIONAL MEMBERS. BRINGING THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT MATTER CHAIR. AS AMENDED- SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ENTITLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OWNER- IN DECIDING WHETHER TO CANCEL A POLICY. TO REVIEW ANY ILLUSTRATION POLICY OR OTHER DISCLOSURE OR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE A PRODUCER TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION OR OTHER INCENTIVES IF THE AMOUNT WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE SALES TRANSACTION OF THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY. SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE A LIFE INSURANCE AGENT TO MAKES SPECIFIC AND SPECIFIED DISCLOSURES TO A PERSPECTIVE POLICY HOLDER INCLUDING IF THE AGENT RECEIVE MONETARY OR NON MONETARY COMPENSATION THAT IS CONTINGENT UPON SELLING A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OR ANNUITY. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE AN ILLUSTRATION OR POLICY TO DISCLOSE FEES AND CHARGES INCLUDING SURRENDER CHARGES AND SPECIFIED FORMS AND WOULD REQUIRE. A PERSPECTIVE POLICY OLDER THE SIGNED A COPY OF THOSE DISCLOSURES THE INSURER WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO RETAIN A COPY OF THE SIGNED AS CLOSURES AS WELL. LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENT PLANS OUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES OFTEN UNIVERSAL LIFE SOLD AS INVESTMENTS THAT CAN PROVIDE TAX FREE PAYMENTS FOR RETIREMENT OR FOR MEDICAL DEPENDENT CARE OR OTHER EXPENSES. NO TAX BENEFITS CAN BE OBTAINED UNLESS THE POLICY REMAINS IN FORCE UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE INSURED OR THE EXCHANGE FOR ANNUITY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE POLICY WILL FAIL TO REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE INSURED OR EXCHANGE AND THUS THE POLICY BENEFITS ARE UNABLE TO BE CLAIMED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME CONSUMERS THOSE POLICIES ARE MOST PRONE TO FAILURE DESPITE. CONSUMER CONTINUE TO HEAVILY INVEST IN THESE POLICIES AND WE MUST PROTECT THE CONSUMER IN ORDER TO PUT IN ORDER FOR CONSUMERS TO AVOID MAKING COSTLY pPOLICIES CONSUMERS NEED BETTER INFORMATION. ABOUT THE POLICY IN THE STRUCTURE. AND THE WORDING. THESE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES HAVE BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLICATED OVER THE YEARS MAKING AN UPDATE TO INSURANCE DISCLOSURE NECESSARY TO UPDATE THE INSURANCE DISCLOSURES ARE NECESSARY SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS BY STRENGTHENING THE RULES AROUND DISCLOSURES INCLUDING AS IT RELATES TO FEEL A STRANGE TAX ADVANTAGES SURRENDERING OF THE POLICY AND STRENGTHENING THE FREE THE FREE LOOK PERIOD TO THIRTY DAYS. TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO REVIEW ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN REGARD TO THE INDUSTRY OPPOSITION. LET ME SAY THIS I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT MY OFFICE AND THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON THEIR CONCERN AND THAT I HAVE ALREADY MADE AUTHOR MEMBERS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF THE BEST INTEREST STANDARD. I HAVE ADDITIONALLY SPOKE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHO HAVE RAISED SOME SOME POTENTIAL CONCERNS WHICH INCLUDES SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS WE WILL BE MAKING TODAY SO WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THAT DIALOGUE OPEN WITH THEM AND CERTAINLY THE DIALOGUE OPEN WITH THE CHAIR SO WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A CONSUMER ORIENTED BILL FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSUMER IS FUTURE HIS INVESTMENTS AND- THERE TO BIRTH INDUSTRY OR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSUMER GROUPS INCLUDING CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA- AND AMERICA. THE LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMER ADVOCACY CENTER THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM UNITED POLICY HOLDERS AND THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL IS BRIAN PROSIGHT BRAZILIAN. AND ON BEHALF OF LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMER ADVOCATE CENTER AND KIM. HOW LET. A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT THESE PLANTS CAN CREATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS BRIAN WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL.

WE HELP AND SUPPORT WITNESS IDENTIFIED WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST WITNESS- BRIAN BROWSE NOT BRESNAHAN FOLLOWED BY KIM HOW LET MISTER BROWN HAD YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS BRYAN BROSNA HAND I MEAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMER ADVOCACY CENTER WE ARE A SPONSOR OF A BEAT NINE TWENTY SEVEN ALONG WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'M AN ATTORNEY WHO CONCLUDED AFTER MANY YEARS OF REPRESENTING LIFE INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS THAT EXISTING LAW DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT CONSUMERS WHO BUY INVESTMENT ORIENTED LIFE INSURANCE AND TOO OFTEN LOSE SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR RETIREMENT SAVINGS BUYING THESE POLICIES. WITH ANOTHER ATTORNEY AND WITH VETERANS OF THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE FORMED THE ADVOCACY CENTER TO ADVOCATE FOR STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE LIFE INSURANCE MARKET. THE THREE INDUSTRY VETERANS ON A REPORT HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF LIFE INSURANCE- EXPERIENCE SO OUR ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE CONSUMER AND THE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVES. SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN IS NEEDED BECAUSE TOO MANY INVESTMENT ORIENTED POLICIES FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH CONSUMERS ARE BUYING THE POLICIES. THEY BECOME SO COMPLICATED THAT NO CONSUMER CAN UNDERSTAND THEM. CONSUMERS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TRUST THE AGENT'S RECOMMENDATION BUT THE AGENT WORKS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND IN MOST CASES HAS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY GET PAID A COMMISSION. BASED ON HOW MUCH CREAM CONCERT A GREASE. NOW THE BILL'S BEEN NARROWED SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED SO THAT IT NO LONGER REQUIRES AGENTS TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER. WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT ISSUE BACK FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE. BUT EVEN HAS NARROWED THE BILL REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY ON SEVERAL KEY ISSUES INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE H. OF RELATIONSHIP AND COMPENSATION. AND THESE DISCLOSURES WILL HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM MAKING THE KINDS OF BAD CHOICES THE RESULT IN THE 8290% POLICY FAILURE RATE. REFER TO BUY A CONDOM IS. THAT WE'VE DOCUMENTED FROM INDUSTRIES PERSISTENCY STUDIES. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ARE TWO DIFFERENT PORTS ANTACID TO VOTE I. S. B. NINE TWENTY SEP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WE WILL NOT HEAR FROM HER NEXT WITH. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR GOT MORE. MY NAME IS KIM HOW WHAT. I CAME FROM SAN DIEGO TO TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HELP PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM FALLING INTO THE TRAP. MY WIFE AND I FELL INTO WHEN WE BOUGHT TO UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES. MY WIFE MARIEL SUPPORTER WANTED TO BE HERE. BUT WHEN THE HEARING TAKE UP MOVES YOU COULD MAKE IT. SO WE WANT TO POLICIES TO BE OUR RETIREMENT PLAN. THE AGENT PITCH THEM AS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TAX FREE RETIREMENT INCOME WHEN YOU INVEST THE MONEY IN THE POLICY EARLY ON. AND THEN THE MONEY GROWS OVER TIME BECAUSE IT INDEX TO THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED. AND THEN YOU CAN BORROW FROM THE POLICY TAX FREE IN YOUR RETIREMENT AND WHEN YOU DIE THE DEATH BENEFIT PAYS OFF THE LOAN. IT SOUNDED GREAT BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE BASICALLY A SCAM. THE PLAN WHY AGES SOLD ME WAS TO PUT THE BALL OF MY RETIREMENT SAVINGS. IT IS THE POLICY IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND NEVER INVEST ANYMORE MONEY AFTER THAT I PAID THE FIRST A HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE POLICY HAD MULTIPLE FEES. THAT REDUCE THE POLICY VALUE EVEN THOUGH THE ILLUSTRATION SHOWED ONLY ONE FEE GOT TO FIFTY THREE THOUSAND AND THEN THEY TERMINATED IT AND TOOK THE REMAINING MONEY. I NEED TO REST ARE WRAPPING UP THANK YOU. MY RECOMMENDATION. WRAP UP HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THESE KIND OF SCAMS TAKE VOTING FOR IT SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH.

ARE WE WILL FOLLOW THESAME PROCESS WITH THE OPPOSITION TODAY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE. MATT POWERS ARE ALSO A TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION AS SHERRY MCCUE- YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR REVIEWING SENATORS MATT POWERS WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE BY THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE. WE STILL UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. AS WE HAVE CONVEYED AT THE VERY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS SINCE INTRODUCTION. THIS BILL TAKES ON SEVERAL ISSUES THAT COULD BE SEPARATE BILLS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT WHICH IS MADE FINDING AGREEMENT ESPECIALLY COMPLEX. TODAY WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE UTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE ON ISSUES OF AGING RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPENSATION. WE HAVE THE AUTHOR IT'S A TO BEGIN WITH THE NATIONAL CONSENSUS APPROACH FOR NEW PRODUCTS. HOWEVER THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHILE IMPROVED CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM THE RECOMMENDED AND A I SEE MODEL. AS DRAFT TO BE A VERY STRONG CONCERNS THE LANGUAGE WILL CREATE AN IMPOSSIBLE COMPLIANCE STANDARDS. WE HAVE ALSO CONSISTENTLY CONVEYED TO THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE THAT WILL SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PRODUCT DISCLOSURES. HOWEVER SOME OF THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN THE BILL CONTINUE TO CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT IS FACTUALLY INACCURATE. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES OF PROPRIETY INFORMATION REQUIRES CARRIERS AND AGENTS POTENTIALLY EXCEED THE SCOPE OF THEIR LICENSE OR- WE BELIEVE THESE ISSUES CAN BE SOLVED OR- AND WE HAVE PROVIDED SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. BUT UNLESS THESE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED WE THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL CREATE THE VERY THING THAT IT IS TRYING TO FIX. CONFUSION FOR CONSUMERS BILL. WILL TRIGGER DAY LUCIA PRODUCT FILINGS THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE. THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS CAPTURED UNDER SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT REVIEW REQUIREMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER AND SOME PRODUCTS REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL. BEFORE ENTERING THE MARKET PLACE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC SINCE APPROVAL CAN TAKE MANY MONTHS. AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT PRODUCTS WILL BE PULLED FROM THE MARKET PLACE WELL THEY'RE REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION WILL HELP BUT IT IS NOT A PANACEA FOR THIS ISSUE. I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO REITERATE MY APPRECIATION OF THE SENATE OR HIS STAFF FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US. THIS BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS ITERATIONS BUT WE BELIEVE WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE IT IS FULLY BAKED. SO THEREFORE YOU MIGHT READ WE REMAIN IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MISS THANK YOU WE HAVE LIMITED TIME STILL ACT AS A VENUE- I WOULD SAY IN A MINUTE. THE STATE YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING I SHERRY MCCUE REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS WE TO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK AND THE AUTHORS I'M INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AND ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AGREED TO THUS FAR HOWEVER WE UNFORTUNATELY TO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ENHANCED- DISCLOSURES WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF ADDITIONAL CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR THESE PRODUCTS. HOWEVER THE- LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A NEW SUBJECTIVE REQUIREMENT AS IT PERTAINS TO COMPENSATION I'M AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR AGENTS MOVING FORWARD WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR ON FUTURE AMENDMENTS IN THE MEANTIME WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TWENTY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN THE CHAMBER WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION THE STATE YOUR NAME AS MANAGER MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA WERE IN THE SAME POSITION AS A PRIOR SPEAKERS- OPPOSED TO THIS BLL WE APPRECIATE THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH THE AUTHOR SO FAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK. SESSION HERE IN THE CHAMBER. SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO WITNESSES WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION GET THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS. MODERATOR IF YOU PLEASE PROMPT INDIVIDUALS WE NEED TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINE TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO WHEN CUED UP FOR PROPOSITION ON TO- MEMBERS THAT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF NOW THAT WE CONCLUDED ON THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORTERS ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM PLEASE DO SO AT THIS TIME. SENATOR GLAZERS RUBIO AND- MY THANKS TO THE- THE SENATOR FROM PICO RIVERA I THINK HE WAS IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT HAS AS WORRIES AT WORRIED ME BEFORE I WAS EVER IN THE SENATE I WAS LOOKING FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT- AND- HIS FOCUS ON CONSUMERS IS RIGHT ON THE MARK IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT. THEY'RE IN THE POSITION TO MAKE THE BEST JUDGMENT THAT THEY CAN- AND IT IS VERY COMPLICATED IT'S VERY COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY WHEN- PITCHES ARE MADE ABOUT TAX CONSEQUENCES- THE ONE THING THAT- CERTAINLY LEARNED IN LIFE IS THAT UNLESS IT'S YOUR EXPERTISE A VERY CAREFUL ABOUT EVER SERVING ANYTHING IN REGARD TO THE LAW- AND CERTAINLY ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO- TAXES- BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLICATED PLACE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CONSULTING WITH THAT. I YOUR YOUR HARD IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN REGARD TO THE BILL- A IN PARTICULAR I THINK THAT THE- THE A CONSUMER THIRTY DAYS. TO CANCEL TO CANCEL A POLICY IS IT SEEMS TO ME OF A VERY REASONABLE. STEP FORWARD TO GIVE. SOMEONE THE CHANCE TO REFLECT ON THAT CHOICE THAT THEY'VE MADE WE KNOW HOW. CONSEQUENTIAL IT IS AND HOW LONG LASTING IT CAN BE. AND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY THE IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT I SEE IN THE LEGISLATION. SOME OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS MA'AM I'M STRUGGLING WITH I REALLY AM TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND- THE IDEA OF. I AND ME TO SAY IT AS A RELATIVE WHAT I'M GONNA SAY NEXT. YEAH DISCLOSURES ARE GOOD. I TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD. BUT THE IN THE REAL WORLD THERE CAN BECOME A SITUATION WHERE THE DISCLOSURES ARE SO VAST THAT YOU LOSE ANY IMPACT ON WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO DO I GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. WHEN I SIGNED MY RENTAL AGREEMENT FROM MY APARTMENT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT WAS SEVENTY FOUR PAGES. SEVENTY FOUR PAGES OF DISCLOSURES AND THEN THE REST THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH AN INITIAL AND SIGN. AND AT SOME POINT- YOU KNOW E. E. LOSE THE IMPACT. AND I TALK ABOUT RENTING I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT OWNING A HOME AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SIGN IN THAT REGARD. SECOND EXAMPLE- VOTERS IN THEIR WISDOM PASS LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW. THAT INITIATIVE MANY YEARS AGO. BRIAN PROPSIXTY EIGHT DISCLOSURES. WHETHER ANY TO BE ANY KIND OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURE THAT A CONSUMER WOULD HAVE. AND% WHAT DID WE SEE UNDER THAT WELL INTENTINED LAW WE HAVE DISCLOSURES EVERYWHERE SIXTY FIVE SORRY I SEE SIXTY EIGHT SIXTY FIVE. WHAT WE SEE IN THAT REGARD. DISCLOSURES ARE EVERYWHERE NOT JUST IN THE GAS STATION BUT EVEN ON A- WHEN YOU PULL YOUR SODA ADDED THAT. THE REFRIGERATED CASE AT YOUR PIZZA PARLOR IS A PROP SIXTY FIVE DISCLOSURE IT'S EVERYWHERE. SO WHAT IMPACT ARE WE REALLY HAVING SO THERE'S THE REAL WORLD SIDE. OF DISCLOSURE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO NOW. IN THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL. THE IDEA THAT AT THAT THAT. A CONSUMER IS GOING TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE PERSON TRYING TO SELL THEM A PRODUCT A PRODUCT. IS BEING CONSTRUCTED STATED. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH CONFUSION IN THAT SPACE- IT'S ALMOST LIKE. GOING INTO A MCDONALD'S AND ORDERING AND THEY'RE SAYING AND HERE'S THE CHARGE YOU'RE SAYING WHAT I HAVE TO PAY. I MEAN. IT'S JUST A PART OF A LIFE THAT THAT SOMEONE IS A SELLER AND A BUYER AND THEY'RE BEING COMPENSATED SO. I'M STRUGGLING IN THAT SPACE FOR WHY THAT DISCLOSURE IS SOMETHING OF RELEVANCE. AND MEANING- WHETHER WE'RE PAYING THAT PERSON A LITTLE BIT OR A LOT. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT- ANY AVERAGE CONSUMER IS NOT GOING TO BE COMPLICATED NOT OVER THEIR HEADS SO I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH WITH THAT PROVISION. YOU KNOW THE TAX BENEFIT DISCLOSURE- IS A WORRISOME PART OF THE SALESMANSHIP THAT DOES OCCUR- BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE REMEDY IN THIS BILL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM. IN THE WAY THAT IS A HEALTHY WAY TO SOLVE IT- AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE FEES ISSUE. THAT I LIKE THE IDEA OF DISCLOSURE OF FEES SPECIALLY IF THERE ARE. GOING TO BE CHARGES AGAINST THE ACCOUNT OVER TIME IT'S ALMOST LIKE. WHETHER THAT'S A HOMEOWNERS FEE- OR THE REST OF THAT THAT THAT'S A HEALTHY THING- BUT I AM STUCK A LITTLE BIT ON THIS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SPACE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY OPPONENTS- AND I'M STUCK A LITTLE BIT ON THESE COMPLIANCE STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE TO EAT HERE TO SELL. A BILL WITH A HEART IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN THE AREA OF- CANCELLATION PERIOD GOOD. BUT SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES I'M REALLY STRUGGLING TO SEE WHY WE'RE ADDING ENHANCE BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS WHICH WE ALL HAVE IS OUR HEART. AND I KNOW IS THE HEART OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR THAT GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU SENATOR A- SENATOR DODD. YEAH WITHOUT TAKING A LOT OF TIME ON THIS TODAY AT THAT SITE IS SO SEE MY COMMENTS WAS CENTER GLAZER- REALLY AGREE WITH THE POINTS HE'S MADE. I THINK WHAT YOU DO HAVE IN THIS BILL IS. A REALLY GOOD I THINK. LEFT IN IT ALSO GIVES US SOME OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW DOWN THE LINE AFTER CHANGE LIKE THAT IS MADE. TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK SENATOR. JONES YOU MAY PROCEED THANK VENTURE. AND I ALSO- HAVE THOSE SHARE SOME OF THOSE SAME CONCERNS AND DETAILS ABOUT THE BILL. I DO HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS. ARE NOT PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THERE'S REGARDING THE CONTINUED EDUCATION PARAMETERS SUBDIVISION A REQUIRES FOR AIR FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING. HOWEVER THEN SUBDIVISION BE MENTIONS TWO ADDITIONAL HOURS. AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY IF THE AUTHOR OR THE PROPONENTS CAN CLARIFY. AT THOSE HOURS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED AND WHAT CURRY. SO IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT WHAT ARE THEIR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED EDUCATION. AND IS THE FOUR HOURS INITIAL AND THEN IT SWITCHED TO ADDITIONAL HOURS EVERY YEAR EVERY OTHER YEAR. OR IS IT FOREIGN TO- IF YOU CAN BREAK THAT DOWN FORCE- PLEASE. AT THAT PORTION OF THE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO. I HAVE THE- TECHNICAL- INFORMATION. GIVEN BY THE- ANYBODY DISEASE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT I THINK IS ALSO JUST A BROKEN HAND THAT YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT PROVISION WAS SUGGESTED BY INDUSTRY- SO MAYBE THIS MAKE YOU WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON TO ADDRESS IT UP WE'RE WE'RE FINE WITH THAT. BUT IT WAS NOT OUR PROPOSAL. THAT'S MAKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WERE THINKING THAT WE WERE HOPING IT WOULD BE FOR YOU FOUR HOURS FIRST- FIRST TIME THEY TOOK THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND THEN TWO HOURS EVERY OTHER LICENSE RENEWAL MESSAGE TO YOUR LICENSE RENEWAL SO BEFORE HOURS UP FRONT FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE LICENSE AND GOING FORWARD EVERY TWO YEARS TWO HOURS. SO WOULDN'T BE SIX COMBINES THE FIRST YEAR BEFORE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY TO. SO IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE IS NOT VERY CLEAR ON THAT AND WE NEED TO CLEAN THAT UP FOR- THIS SEEMED AMBIGUOUS TO ME.

MOVED BY SENATOR WESSEL- CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JONES NO ARCHULETA I'VE OCULAR AYE BATES. BATES NOW FOR JUST. DOT HI DODD AYE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE HUESO. WHAT I PATADA PORTANTINO HI PORTANTINO I BROUGHT. I BOUGHT A. THE BILL HAS EIGHT BOOKS. THE MOTION WAS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE OF APPROPRIATIONS AT THIS POINT I SEE. THAT WE HAVE A FEW MEMBERS ABSENCE WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER TO LETTER THANK YOU BETTER HERE THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN BY SENATOR DODD SENATOR DODD WHEN YOU'RE READY. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- SB ELEVEN OH SEVEN WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIA DRIVERS IN ANYONE WHO IS HE- ISN'T. INJURED IN A CAR pDRIVERS BY MODERNIZING CALIFORNIA'S OUTDATED. MINIMUM AUTO LIABILITY COVERAGE LIMITS. LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS ON PAGES SEVEN EIGHT NINE. OF THE ANALYSIS THEY COULD SHARE. THE CONSOLE FOR WORKING MY STAFF AND I. TO REACH THIS COMPROMISE PROCEED THAT VERY MUCH. WELL EVERY STATE THE COUNTRY REQUIRES DRIVERS TO PURCHASE AUTO INSURANCE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PROTECTION. CALIFORNIA HAS FALLING DANGEROUSLY BEHIND. IN PROTECTING OUR CITIZENS. FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE MANDATORY AUTO INSURANCE LIABILITY MINIMUMS AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE INJURY OR DEATH. THIRTY THOUSAND FOR INJURY TO OR DEATH OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. LET ME REPEAT THAT. CALIFORNIA'S AUTO INSURANCE LIABILITY LIMITS WERE ESTABLISHED FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SETS. CALIFORNIA RANKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THREE BOTTOM THREE STATES WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS OF PROTECTION IN THE NATION. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE COST FOR A NEW FORD MUSTANG WAS TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. TODAY A NEW MUSTANG WOULD COST IN EXCESS OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN A DAY IN THE HOSPITAL WOULD COST NINETY TWO DOLLARS A DAY. WELL TODAY THE MINIMUM HOSPITALS STAY IS OVER THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY. A DRIVER MUST BE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE COMPENSATION NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INTRAPARTY WHOLE AGAIN REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE FOR THE CAR CRASH. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT MINIMUM AUTO LIMITS A CALIFORNIA ARE FAR TOO LOW AND ARE WELL OVERDUE FOR AN INCREASE. TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND FAIR PROTECTION WE NEED TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM OUT OF REQUIRED FINANCIAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SB ELEVEN OH SEVEN WOULD MODERNIZE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LIMITS TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE INJURY OR DEATH. SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INJURY TO OR DEATH OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON. AND AS TO BE AMENDED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCESSION BELIEVE ME. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST 32% OF THE BODILY INJURY CLAIMS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO BOOKS SEE THE CURRENT FIFTEEN THOUSAND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLDS. THEREFORE INDIVIDUALS WITH SUCH OVER EXTENDED CLAIMS WILL HAVE TO RELY ON OTHER SOURCES TO BE FULLY REIMBURSED FOR THEIR MEDICAL EXPENSES WAGE LOSS AND CAR REPAIRS. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO BE OMITTED SKEWS ME SB ELEVEN OH SEVEN WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE TO STUDY THE UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE TO TRY TO DETERMINE. IF IT IS PROVIDING THE KIND OF COVERAGE. DENTED AND IF IT'S IF IT IT IF IT HELPS IN INSURED WHO IS INJURED BY AN AT FAULT DRIVER WITH INADEQUATE- INSURANCE COVERAGE MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE COST OF S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN WE HAVE COMPETING ESTIMATES FROM INSURANCE AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHICH WE MIGHT ALL TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER HAS ALSO ESTIMATED THE COST IMPACT OF THE BILL THAT COST IMPACT WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS PER MONTH ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE NO ONE LIKES TO INCREASE COST. TO GO. BOTH CAN SEARCH. LEVEL SEVEN WE MUST WEIGH THE COST AGAINST THE BENEFITS AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE HIGH COST OF VEHICLE REPAIR MEDICAL EXPENSES LOST WAGES AND OTHER FALLOUT FOR BOTH VEHICLE COLLISION AND SMALL ADDITIONAL COSTS FROM F. S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN ARE WELL WORTH THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION WITH ME TODAY IS CASEY JOHNSON REPRESENTING THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS MICHAEL MARTINEZ REPRESENTING THE ISURANCE COMMISSIONER- RICARDO LARA AND DAISY SAY SO AN AUTO ACCIDENT VICTIMS. ESPECIALLY AFTER I'VE- THANK YOU SO ARCH. I'M SORRY. MR DODD FORGIVE ME.

RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DRIVERS CARRYING INSURANCE. WHEN AN ACTIVE FINANCE RESPONSIBILITY LIMITS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INCIDENT FOR BODILY INJURIES. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. THESE LIMITS HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED IN FIFTY FIVE YEARS. WHEN FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OR AN ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOSPITAL'S DAY SINGLE DAY LOSS WAS NINETY TWO DOLLARS. TODAY THAT COST CAN BE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE INCLUDING PHYSICIAN FEES. AND TESTING COSTS THIS MEANS THAT CONSUMERS EITHER NEEDED ON DEBT TREATMENT UNLESS THEY CAN GET THEIR INJURIES PAID FOR BY THE AT FAULT DRIVER OR THEIR OWN UNDER INSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE. WHILE ADJUSTING LIMITS TO MATCH INFLATION WOULD REQUIRE INCREASING THOSE LIMITS TO OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SB ELEVEN OH SEVEN SIX A MODEST INCREASE IN THESE LIMITS. AND ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD IN TEN YEARS TIME. THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INJURED TO BE FULLY COMPENSATED FOR THEIR INJURIES AND WILL ALL GIVE ALSO GIVE CALIFORNIA DRIVERS PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY'LL BE FULLY PROTECTED FROM LAWSUITS IN THE EVENT THAT THEY CAUSE AN INJURY. WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO UNINSURED UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE IS WOULD ALSO BENEFIT CALIFORNIA ELEVEN OH SEVEN CONTAINS A PROVISION FOR STUDIES THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ON THESE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. I'D LIKE TO SEE MY REMAINING TIME IT TOO- MICHAEL MARTINEZ. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE YOU DID HAVE TO STEP OUT BUT OUR DRIVER ON ELEVEN OH SEVEN AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

FOR THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TODAY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE DANNY RITTER I AM ALSO- FOLLOWED BY SEREN TAYLOR. THIS DANNY GO AHEAD AND YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RUBIO AND MEMBERS THAT ANY WRITER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION ON S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN- S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN IS PREMISED ON HELPING LOWERING. DRIVERS OBTAIN. READ HOWEVER THE COVERAGE ALREADY IN THAT WISHES TO PURCHASE IT THERE HUNDREDS OF AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE HAPPY TO COMPETE FOR THIS BUSINESS. RATHER WHAT THE BILL DOES IT WILL FORCE CALIFORNIA DRIVERS TO PURCHASE HIGHER COVERAGE WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT. THIS BILL WILL DOUBLE THE MINIMUM RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY LIMITS. AND THIS COVERAGE THE DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO KERRY IN ORDER TO DRIVE A CAR IN CALIFORNIA. I'M ITS COVERS COVERAGE THE DRIVERS PURCHASE TO PROTECT OTHER DRIVERS- AND THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THOSE DRIVERS WHO ARE CARRYING THOSE MINIMUM LIMITS SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND. DRIVERS CARRYING MINIMUM LIMIT MINIMUM LIMIT DRIVERS ARE LIKELY DOING SO BECAUSE THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE THEY CAN AFFORD TO PURCHASE. MINIMUM LIMIT DRIVERS ARE NOT DRIVING FANCY AUTOMOBILES AND LIVING IN MILLION DOLLAR HOMES SO THE EFFECTS OF THIS BILL WILL BE BORNE BY THAT POPULATION. INSURERS DON'T HAVE TO GUESS WHAT THE DOLLAR EFFECT WILL BE ON THEIR POLICY HOLDERS WE ASK OUR MEMBERS. TO GIVE US AN AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE. IF THEY TOOK THEIR EXISTING MINIMUM ONE CUSTOMERS AND DOUBLE THAT COVERAGE. OUR MEMBERS RESPONSES RANGED FROM EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR INSURERS THAT WRITE FEW MINIMUM IT POLICIES UP TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR INSURERS THAT WRITE A LARGE CHUNK OF THEIR BUSINESS AND MINIMAL MINUTES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS WILL FACE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN INCREASED INSURANCE COSTS IF THIS BILL PASSES WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEES THERE AS WELL AS HIS WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THEM. UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL DRIVE UP AUTO INSURANCE RATES FOR THESE DRIVERS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. AT A TIME WHEN INFLATION AND GAS PRICES ARE ALREADY PLACING IMMENSE FINANCIAL STRAIN ON THESE PEOPLE. FOR THESE CONSUMERS PAYING SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FOR CAR INSURANCE MAY FORCE THEM OUT OF THE MARKET ENTIRELY WHICH WILL RESULT IN MORE UNINSURED MOTORIST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ASK- FOR YOUR OPPOSITION TO THE THANK YOU THANK YOU- NET NEXT WE HAVE SERIN SERIN WE HAVE LIMITED TIME SO. I ASK THAT YOU EXPEDITE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU OKAY- I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SEVEN TAYLOR ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN WE ARE OPPOSED TO A CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS MADE. MAYBE WATER MAY BE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE OF THIS BILL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AUTO INSURANCE RATES WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT. AND WE SUGGEST THAT YOU ALL GO ONLINE TO GET A QUOTE FOR YOURSELF. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE REAL IMPACT THIS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL THERE ARE CURRENTLY TREMENDOUS PRESSURES ON AUTO INSURANCE RATES. AS A RESULT OF THE INFLATION IN USED CAR PRICES AND PARKS. AS WELL AS INCREASE IN ACCIDENTS SEVERITY. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS CORRECT THAT THE POLICY TRADE OFF HERE IS ESSENTIALLY. MORE CASH AVAILABLE FOR ACCIDENT VICTIMS AND ATTORNEYS TO RECOVER. VERSUS SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES FOR MILLIONS OF LOW INCOME DRIVERS. THAT SAID WE BELIEVE THESE ADJUSTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING THOSE MOVE THIS BILL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO REDUCE THE COST PRESSURE ON CONSUMERS. AND SHOULD THE BILL PASS TODAY WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO FURTHER MITIGATE THOSE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE CHAMBER YOU MAY PROCEED.

YOUR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS IT WAS SO NOTED THAT- THIS PROVISION WAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND- AS CO AUTHOR I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL REPEAT TIME IT ALSO LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE CHAIR AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN TURNING THIS BILL INTO SOMETHING IS SO TERRIBLY NEEDED AND WE CAN HEAR STORY AFTER STORY HOW A PEOPLE WERE UNDER INSURED AND- THE TO RECTIFY THAT SO I FULLY- AS FOR AYE VOTE IN REQUESTED WE CONTINUE- ON TO THE NEXT AND I- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE I THINK I SEE- SENATOR ROB YOU MAY PRESS I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY TODAY REGARDING THE- AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE FOR THOSE- IMPACTED. OF THE QUESTION I ASK VERY EARLY IN THIS PROCESS- NOT TO THE AUTHOR BUT TO OTHERS AND WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT WAS THE- DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THIS CHANGE THAT WAS A QUESTION I ALSO ASK YOU VERY EARLY IN THIS PROCESS- BECAUSE THAT WAS ALSO. TO ME. I WOULDN'T KNOW I AM SENDING THAT THE LOWEST OF THOSE THE LOWEST INCOME OF THOSE. WHO ARE REQUIRED TO. THE PURPOSE SEVEN. INSURANCE FOR THE OPERATION VEHICLE HAVE ANOTHER OPTION- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. BASED ON THIS- TESTIMONY REGARDING THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE OF WHETHER IT'S EIGHTY DOLLARS OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RUN THE MATH ON THAT IF MY MATH IS CORRECT THAT TRANSLATES TO ABOUT SIX DOLLARS A MONTH. AT THE LOW END. OR A TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. AT THE HIGH END AND I SIMPLY DO NOT THINK THAT THAT'S TOO MUCH TO PAY- TO OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE ON THE ROADS AND STREETS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OTHERS ARE COMPENSATED WHERE THERE IS NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER ACTION ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER THE MOTOR VEHICLE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I THINK THE OTHER BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO MAKE COMMENTS OR SPEAK I SEE SENATOR GLAZERS YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK THANK YOU CHAIR RUBIO- CERTAINLY NO ONE WANTS TO- TO TAKE ACTION TO INCREASE COSTS BUT YOU KNOW GOODNESS GRACIOUS LOOK AT OUR WORLD TODAY AND- COSTS ARE GOING UP EVERY EVERY LEVEL AND REALLY IMPACTING OUR CITIZENRY IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND I THINK WE ALL FEEL THAT. THAT WERE IN THAT PAIN THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SO I KNOW I'M TRYING TO EXAMINE THIS BILL. AS OBJECTIVELY I CAN BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO RAISE RATES OKAY SO THEN. THE QUESTION REALLY IS DO WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL MARKET PLACE WHERE- WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE GETTING REALLY ISN'T WORKING AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THIS HAS BEEN IN PLACE. I RISK THAT THAT HELP. THEM THAT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER FOR ME THAT CENTRAL QUESTION WHICH IS THAT. IF A REQUIREMENT A MINIMUM BECAUSE WORSE OR SETTING AN EXPECTATION THAT IS WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH THE MOST COMMON. OR THAT THE AVERAGE OR WHATEVER- COSTS OF. IN. THEN WE MAY HAVE A DATE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A CENTRAL QUESTION FOR ME SO I GUESS MY QUESTION THE AUTHOR WOULD BE- JEFF TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF THE AVERAGE CLAIMS IN THESE CATEGORIES GIVE US A SENSE OF WHETHER- THE MINIMUMS ARE REALLY COVERING THAT THE BULK OF WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THOSE ACCIDENTS. QUESTION NUMBER ONE. SENATOR DONNELLY WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT YES WATER IF MICHAEL MARTINEZ IS STILL IN- YES YES. IF HE'S COMING TO THE MY- WELCOME MICHAEL MARTINEZ YOU MAY PROCEED. YES THANK YOU- TO RUBIO COMMISSIONER LARA AND DEPARTMENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LOTTE IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND DOES APPRECIATE THE- OF THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AMENDMENTS TAKEN OUT TO THE BILL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION ABOUT- THE- I WHETHER CURRENT EXISTING LEVELS OF COVERAGE. DO ARE ABLE. NAMES ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT STAFF ARE ESTIMATES. STATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 32% OF THE BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AND 30% OF PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY CLAIMS. WILL EXCEED THE CURRENT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LEVELS IN EXISTENCE TODAY THE THRESHOLDS TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT A DEPARTMENT STAFF. HAD ESTIMATED FOR THIS YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SO JUST FROM- IN REGARDS TO. THE DEPARTMENT STATISTICS WE DO BELIEVE THAT AT LEAST NEARLY A THIRD OF CURRENT COVERAGE TODAY. MOTORISTS WILL EXCEED THE MINIMUM LIMITS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I DO- SO YOU'RE SAYING ONE ONE OUT OF THREE POLICY HOLDERS WHO THINK THEY'RE GETTING COVERAGE BASED ON WAS AT TWENTY TWENTY TWO DATA- ARE NOT. GETTING THE COMPENSATION THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET TO COVER THEIR THEIR INJURIES IS THAT CORRECT. L. AS SENATOR YES THE I WOULD SAY THAT THE COURT INDOOR ESTIMATES THAT CLAIMS. WILL EXCEED THE POLICY HOLDERS CURRENT FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE MINIMUM ONE THAT SPECIALS TODAY AND IS THERE ANYTHING ANYTHING ON THE REGULATORY SIDE THAT IS IN YOUR POWER TO DATE TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM. I WILL I WILL CHARGE THAT CAN CHARGE MORE YOU CAN AUTHORIZE GREATER RATES FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH IS THAT IS THAT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM A BIT HARD ON THE ACOUSTICS IF YOU CAN REPEAT JUST THE LAST. SENTENCE THAT YOU STATED I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I APPRECIATE YET THE CHALLENGES HERE IN THE CHAMBERS THANK YOU FOR- IN DURING THAT. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS HAS IS IN A POSITION TO DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN OTHER WORDS. WHEN INSURANCE COMPANY COMES IN AND ASKS FOR. THEIR RATE INCREASES FOR EXAMPLE- WOULD YOUR DECISION REGARDING RATE INCREASES CHANGE THAT PROBLEM THAT YOU JUST IDENTIFIED WHERE ONE OUT OF THREE. INJURED PARTIES IS NOT GOING TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR INJURIES. I WOULD SAY THAT UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE THE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO APPROVING ACTUARIAL SOUND RATES AS REQUIRED UNDER PROPER ONE OF THREE WHICH DOES STATE.THAT NO RACHEL BE APPROVED OR REMAIN IN EFFECT WHICH IS EXCESSIVE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY WE DO BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE IN THE FURTHER MEN AND TAKE TO THE MEASURE TO. HAVE A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A PROCESS INTERN FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE- UPDATED RATE FILINGS. IMPLEMENT S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN AND GIVE THEM THE TIME TO- PROVIDE WHAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE NEEDED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE RATE TO ME S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN AND GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THAT TIME TO PROCESS THOSE NEW LIMITS UNDER S. B. ELEVEN OH SEVEN. RIGHT SO WHAT I'D HEARD YOU SAID IS IT IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED INTO LAW THAT THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY CAN COME AND ASK FOR RATES TO DEAL WITH THOSE HIGHER OBLIGATIONS BUT MY QUESTION IS DIFFERENT. WHETHER THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE POWER IN THE APARTMENT OF INSURANCE TODAY. TO DEAL WITH THIS CONCERN THIS DOES THE FACTUAL. DISCLOSURE THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US WHICH IS THAT A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED ARE GOING TO GET COMPENSATED TO THE LEVEL OF ITS REQUIRED. IS THERE ANY REGULATORY ACTION THAT YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO TAKE ABSENT A CHANGE IN THE LAW. TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM. OR WERE LEFT WITHOUT WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. REQUIREMENT FOR A LOT CHANGE TO DO SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING ABLE TO RESTATE THAT QUESTION AND I WOULD SAY THAT UNDER EXISTING- THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING AUTHORITY IS THAT- AND AS STATED IN COMMISSIONER SUPPORT LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO CONSIDER PURCHASING HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS THAN CURRENT LAW REQUIRES IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE THEY HAVE MORE ADEQUATE COVERAGE WHEN THEY'RE INVOLVED IN A COLLISION BECAUSE- THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. A STEP AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN THEY DO NOT HAVE V. D. V. LIMITS NEEDED TO COVER CLAIMS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM WHOLE AND FOR INJURED PARTIES HOLE AND PROPERTIES THAT THAT ARE. OF THERE ARE ALSO AFFECTED SO YES WE DO- DO VERY AGGRESSIVE EDUCATION OUTRAGE. BUT ONLY BUT THAT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR SO PLEASE KNOW THAT WE DO UNDER EXISTING. IS THE CURRENT RATE PROCESS THERE IS THE CURRENT. OUTREACH AND EDUCATION THAT UNDER COMMISSIONER LOT IN THE DEPARTMENT WE DO VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND REGARDED INFORMING ENCOURAGING CONSUMERS. TO PURCHASE HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS AND THAT. CAN VERY WELL BE THE CASE FOR. A GOOD MAJORITY CALIFORNIANS BUT JUST KNOW THAT- THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION THIS IS THIS BILL ANOTHER. TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO HELP CONSUMERS THANK YOU SO ITS DEPARTMENTS VIEW THAT EDUCATING. CONSUMERS IS NOT RESULTED IN PEOPLE BUYING POLICIES AT HIGHER LEVELS THAT WOULD MORE ADEQUATELY COVER. IT YES SIR. AND THAT WHEN YOU- PUT IN I'M LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS LETTER WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT ONE OUT OF THREE NOT BEING COMPENSATED TO THEIR INJURY CLAIMS THAT INCORPORATES THAT EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT- INSTEAD FOR PEOPLE TO CARE HIGHER POLICY LIMITS. THAT SPEAKS TO- THE SITUATION AS YOU FIND IT NOT WHAT YOU'D LIKE IT TO BE THAT RIGHT. YES ACCORDING TO MY DEPARTMENT A STAFF FOR A LOT MORE- INVOLVED AND THIS LEVEL OF. OF AND EXPERTISE IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD OF INSURANCE YES AND FINALLY AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR FOR HIS EXPERT. WITNESS WHICH IS THAT. OUT WE DON'T ALWAYS LIKE TO FOLLOW OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY- WE LIKE TO SET OUR OWN PRACTICE- BUT PERHAPS AT TIMES WE MIGHT LEARN FROM WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING- AND IN THIS CASE- THIS ISSUE OF FIVE. COSTS AND LIABILITY IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU. KNOW BORDER- PREVENTS COULD YOU I SPEAK TO- WE'RE CALIFORNIA IS IN THE NATIONAL. SCALE OF- THESE KINDS OF MINIMUM FIREMAN AND IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM. FROM THAT THOSE FINDINGS- OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES. TENER DOT YOU MAKE RESPOND TO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHERE THE BOTTOM THREE. OUT OF FIFTY STATES AND IT YOU KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES. AS TO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM. FROM OTHER STATES- I DON'T HAVE THE DATA ALL YOU KNOW ON THAT SPECIFICALLY. BUT I KNEW I DO KNOW THAT THAT SITE. TO DO THE MATH FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE. LARGER LIMITS THAN THAT THAN WE DO. AND DO DOING THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND DO WE KNOW FINAL QUESTION WHICH IS DO WE KNOW- AND WITH ANY DATA ON THE YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS BEING RAISED. THAT THE UNINSURED MARKET PLACE IS GOING TO GO UP RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THE HIGHER RATES. DO WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT TO KNOW. WHETHER THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THESE OTHER STATES IN WHO WHO WAS THAT WHO WAS BORN THE BURDEN OF THAT. WHAT WAS INTENDED TO BE A POSITIVE THAT TURNS INTO A NEGATIVE. IT ALL WAIT AND SEE IF ANYBODY GOES UP TO THE MIKE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY. WE'VE ALREADY- IT KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS GOING TO RAISE THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE SAID FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S LESS THAN FIFTY. DOLLARS A YEAR. I DIDN'T PRACTICAL TO- THE LIKE A COUPLE OF START. WATER IN A ONCE A- WORKING IN THE CHIEF SMALLEST WHAT TO. LOOK AT NOBODY WANTS EXTRA PRICE TODAY INCLUDING ME- THE INFLATION PRESSURES EVERY THAT'S WHY WITH. THE CHAIR- WAS- INSISTED UPON HAVING A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL SO WE'RE NOT CONSUMERS ARE NOT FEELING THIS- YOU KNOW THIS YEAR DURING- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE. WAS A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BRIAN YEAH SO WE GOT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. YOUR DATE ON THIS SO HOPEFULLY WE'RE BEHIND THIS INFLATIONARY PERIOD AND NOT MAKING IT A SIGNIFICANT- ISSUE BUT THIS IS LET ME JUST SAY. FOR FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH IT DOUBLES THE COVERAGE. AND I WOULD ALSO GO FURTHER TO SAY. THIS PROBLEM EXTENDS NOT ONLY FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE ANYBODY WHERE MOST THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR LIMITS ARE. IF YOUR. INSURANCE ASIAN IS ASK YOU TO GO HIGHER- I. PAY ATTENTION I HAD IDEA I WENT DID. A SURVEY WITH. FRIENDS OF MY- THEY'RE ALL BUSINESS. ATTORNEYS INSURANCE AGENTS INSURANCE AGENT NEW OF COURSE THE INSURANCE AGENT WOULD DO WHAT NOW. BUT NOBODY ELSE KNEW. WHAT THEIR COVERAGESWERE WHERE THEY WERE MINIMUM. NO INSURANCE AGENT EVER ASK THEM AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE STUDY PORTION. OF THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. THANK YOU AND WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE CHAIR THAT I KNOW THAT THE CENTER DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IF THERE ARE EXPERTS FROM EITHER SIDE TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.I THINK WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM HEARING THAT. IN THE CASE OF FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE HIGHER LIMITS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS HOW THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN WHO HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY IT. AND I'D LIKE IT IF THE CHAIR IS IN AGREEMENT BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THEM ON THAT. SO I WILL ASK ANYONE THAT'S- I'VE BEEN A GALLERY THAT. IF ANYONE HAS INFORMATION LIKE TO SHARE I'D GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THIS POINT. I SEE DANNY COMING TO THE MICROPHONE DO YOU HAVE THAT DATA THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE. SO I DON'T HAVE THE DATA ON ME BUT I WILL SAY THAT- WE- I THINK BOTH SIDES CAN POINT TO VARIOUS STATES WHERE WE'VE SEEN AFTER A BILL LIKE THIS IT'S PAST. AN INCREASE IN UNINSURED MOTORISTS- AND A VERY AND EITHER A STEEP INCREASE IN THE OVERALL COST OF. AUTO INSURANCE BUT THE SPECIALLY IN THE SEGMENT. OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE CARRYING THIS LEVEL OF COVERAGE. AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH. US SENATOR GLAZER ON SPECIFIC FIGURES. EACH OF THOSE STATES THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS PAST IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. OKAY I WILL NOW CONCLUDE- THE PARTICIPATION FROM OUTSIDE. I WILL TURN IT OVER ON. CENTER GLAZER. THE THAT COUNTRY YOU'RE QUESTION I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR RON YOU MAY PROCEED. I KNOW WE HAVE A CALLING THE NEEDS TO GO VOTE BUT- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. DOES THE COMMISSIONER HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM INSURANCE LEVELS REQUIRED IN THE STATE OR IS THAT THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THAT WAS MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER. HE'S COMING TO THE MIKE MICHAEL MARTINEZ WOULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO NUMBER TEN IS. THIRTY IS NOT NOT. THANK YOU VERY. OKAY I KNOW THE SOME OF OUR- ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN TO THE COMMITTEES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE- I WILL JUST SAY REALLY QUICKLY- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE WE DID. A SIT DOWN YOU KNOW. QUITE A BIT AND NOT ONLY WITH AUTHOR BUT THAT WILL BE OUR SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO A MIDDLE GROUND. I DID HAVE COST PRESSURE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTHOR AGREED TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION AND- THIS IS A BILL THAT CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT AS I SPOKE TO THE AUTHOR THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO. TO BE OPEN MINDED AND RIGHT NOW. HE'S TAKING A LOT OF MEN. WE SHOULD. SELL A WORK. THERE IN A REAL GOOD PLACE WHERE WE- SPEAK YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT MOTOR IS CONSUMERS ARE.
