IMPLEMENTING A REPORTING

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.968

COMPANIES WHAT TO DO OR NOT DO

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:30.071
IT DOESN'T RESTRICT THEIR

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:32.340
FREEDOM TO OPERATE. IT DOESN'T

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.841

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:48.756
FIRST STEP. I DON'T THINK IT'LL

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.124

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:27.680

THE BILLS THAT I'VE HAD TO

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:30.350
NAVIGATE BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF

MISINFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:37.090

I FIRST SAW ELEVEN THIRTY NINE

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.961
I SAID WHAT WHY WHY. AM I GONNA

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:45.198
THAT THE P. YOU SEE SHOULD BE

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:47.300
DOING. BUT I'D ALREADY KNOWN

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:49.035
FROM PREVIOUS BILLS THAT THE

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:51.337

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:53.306
THEY SHOULD BE DOING. AS

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:54.874
QUICKLY AS THEY SHOULD BE DOING

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.843
THAT. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:58.344
THAT ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS I

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.380
EVER VOTED ON IN THIS ASSEMBLY

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.315
WAS TO TELL THE C. P. U. C. TO

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:04.117
STOP THE CAUTION. THAT IS

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:07.353
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. UNDER OUR

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.856
NET METERING. AND YET HERE WE

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.025
ARE EIGHT YEARS LATER ST WE

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:12.992
STILL NEED TO STOP THIS

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:17.097
COLLECTION. DESPITE WHAT SOME

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:18.832
FOLKS SAY THERE IS A COST SHIFT

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:20.834
EVERY SINGLE REPORT THAT HAS

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:23.436
BEEN MADE ABOUT HOW WE DO NET

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:26.439
ENERGY METERING. SAYS IT THE

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:30.477
CPUC SAYS THAT SMUD SAYS IT UC

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.278
BERKELEY SAYS IT THERE IS A

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:34.447
COST SHIFT OF THREE BILLION

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:36.382
DOLLARS AND THAT MEANS THE

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:38.118
PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE ROOFTOP

01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:41.054
SOLAR ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY

01:52:41.121 --> 01:52:43.823
MY WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORS. WHO

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:46.259
WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD.

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:49.662
SOLAR IN SAN DIEGO. THAT THAT

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:51.698
THAT IS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:54.033
DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT IS BEING

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:57.737
PAID BY FOLKS WHO SOME DON'T

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:00.173
WANT SOLAR SHARE SOME WHO ARE

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.975
RENTERS WHO HAVE NO CONTROL

01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:04.911
OVER WHETHER THE HOPS UP SOLAR

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:06.479
SOME WHO HAVE BAD ROOFS AND

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:07.947
CAN'T GET SOLAR. IN SOME WHO

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:09.215
JUST MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE THAT

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.551
FACES WRONG WAY INSULAR

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:14.187
WOULDN'T WORK FOR THEM. IN A

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:15.421
COURSE THOSE WHO WILL NEVER BE

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:17.657
ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SO INSTEAD

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:20.927
WE SAY EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOES

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:22.328
AND GET OLDER UNDER THEIR

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:25.465
HOUSE. IT PUTS ADDITIONAL COST

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:26.065
ON THOSE FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE

01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:28.401
SOLAR. THIS STARTED IN THE

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:29.269
NINETEEN NINETIES AND IT WAS

01:53:29.335 --> 01:53:31.304
WRONG AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:32.405
STAND UP AND SAY THE WAY WE

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.807
DECIDED TO FUND IN INCENTIVIZE

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:35.708
SOLAR WHEN WE DESPERATELY

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:39.712
NEEDED MORE WAS WRONG. AND SO

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:41.281
IT'S BEEN SO POPULAR AND SO

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:43.349
SUCCESSFUL THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.552
REVISITING AND SAYING HEY C. P.

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:47.353

THIS. SHOULD WE- INCENTIVIZE

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:53.893
ROOFTOP SOLAR PROBABLY YES I

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.795
WOULD SAY YES AND WE SHOULD DO

01:53:55.862 --> 01:53:58.731
IT. THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET IN

01:53:58.798 --> 01:54:01.868
A FAIR WAY WE SHOULD NOT DO IT

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:04.437
ON THE BACKS OF RATE PAYERS. I

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.239

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.419
IF ANYBODY REMEMBERS LIFELINE.

01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:20.920

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:37.270
RATES CONTINUE TO RISE. IT'S

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.439
NOT EASY TO TAKE ON MY FRIENDS

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.241
AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY WHO

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:43.176
SUGGESTS THAT SOMEHOW I WANT TO

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:45.745
KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR. SURE I'M A

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:47.647
ROOFTOP SOLAR ADVOCATE I HAVE

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:49.882
IT ON MY OWN HOUSE. BUT

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:51.217
SOMETIMES TO BE A LEADER IN OUR

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:52.852
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO BE

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.587
HONEST WITH TO BE HONEST WITH

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:56.956
OUR FRIENDS. AND WE HAVE TO BE

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:58.858
ON OUR WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:00.126
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THOSE

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.694
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:03.896
TODAY AREN'T BEING. COMPLETELY

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:05.665
HONEST BUT MOST YOU HAD PRIVATE

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.166
CONVERSATIONS WITH ME AND

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:08.534
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:12.138
NECESSARY. IT'S HARD TO LEAD ON

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:14.073
AN ISSUE LIKE THIS WHEN THERE'S

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:16.542
SO MUCH MISINFORMATION. BUT

01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:17.176
REST ASSURED THAT

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.711
MISINFORMATION ISN'T JUST

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:19.879
HAPPENING BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.047
FIRE MENTAL COMMUNITY LIKE

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:22.782
SOLAR. IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:24.083
OUR BIG SOLAR CORPORATIONS ON

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.419
THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE ACTUALLY

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:28.388
PROFITING OFF THE SUBSIDY

01:55:28.454 --> 01:55:30.890
PROFITING OFF THE SUBSIDY THAT

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:32.725
MY NEIGHBORS WHO CAN'T AFFORD

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:35.328
IT OUR PAIN. AND SO THIS

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.263
OPPOSITION HAS BUT NOT ORGANIC

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.865
IT'S BEEN GENERATED AND MOST

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:40.767
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:43.002
THE ISSUE IS. WE'VE TAKEN

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.337
AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL TO

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:46.339
ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE

01:55:46.406 --> 01:55:48.074
ALREADY INVESTED ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:49.175
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:50.343
THE INVESTMENT ON IT AND PAY IT

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:54.047
OFF. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S APROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO LEASE

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:57.183
SOLAR. I HAVE COMMITTED TO NRDC

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.818
INTO TURN BOTH OF WHOM ARE

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:00.553
SUPPORT IF AMENDED TO FIX THAT

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.356
IN THE SENATE. IF YOU HAVE BEEN

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:05.191
UNFORTUNATELY DUPED INTO A

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:07.093
CONTRACT BY A SOLAR COMPANY AND

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.294
NOW WE'RE STUCK IN A CONTRACT

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.697
WITH IT IS NOT FAIR. TO FORCE

01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:12.699
YOU TO PAY OFF THAT CONTRACT

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.534
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REAP THE

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.202
BENEFITS OF THE SUBSIDY THIRTY

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:17.737
SECONDS BUT FOR US IN THE

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:19.505
FUTURE TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON

01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:20.873
RENEWABLE ENERGY WHICH WE'RE

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.041
STILL GOING TO GET TO ONE

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:23.576

DONE IN A WAY IT HAS TO BE DONE

01:56:31.984 --> 01:56:33.386
IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR TO ALL

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:35.888
CONSUMERS. AND IT CAN BE DONE

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.757

ARKANSAS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:41.627

THE HEAVY LIFTING. THE COST

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:13.679
SHIFTING DUE TO NET ENERGY

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:15.681
METERING IS BACKWARDS. MIDDLE

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.383
AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:24.390
INITIALLY SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR

PROVIDED IN THE NINETIES TO

SOLAR IS NO LONGER IN ITS

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:33.099
INFANCY HOWEVER AND IT'S

01:59:33.165 --> 01:59:35.234
CONTINUED GROW SINCE THE LAST

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:39.705

PREVAILING WAGES. THIS IS THE

01:59:46.445 --> 01:59:48.047
NECESSARY BILL TO PROVIDE

01:59:48.114 --> 01:59:50.216
EQUITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:52.184

RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:02.028
VOTE FOR AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE.

02:00:02.094 --> 02:00:03.396
THANK YOU MISS CALDERON MR

02:00:03.462 --> 02:00:06.699
HOLDEN. YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU

02:00:06.766 --> 02:00:10.937
MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:13.039
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:14.507
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:17.777
OUT THERE ON THIS BILL VERY

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:19.078
LITTLE OF WHICH IS ACCURATE LET

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:21.881
ME HIGHLIGHT. FIRST THIS BILL

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:24.317
IS ABOUT RATES THIS BILL DOES

02:00:24.383 --> 02:00:25.685
NOT PREVENT ANY CUSTOMER FROM

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:28.054
CHOOSING TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:30.923
ROOFTOPS. SECOND THIS BILL IS

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:32.425
ABOUT FAIR RATES FOR ALL

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:34.994
REPAIRS REPAIRS ARE CURRENTLY

02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.429
PAYING TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:39.298
FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT IS VALUE

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.800
TO THE GRID OR TO THE

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:43.502
RATEPAYERS. AND THE QUESTION IS

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:46.272
WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE CURRENT

02:00:46.339 --> 02:00:50.309
LAW MANDATES THE CPUC TO ENSURE.

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:51.911
THAT THE SOLAR INDUSTRY SO GROW

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:54.680
SUSTAINABLY. THIS IS A THE

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:57.049
HISTORIC MISSION OF THE CPUC.

02:00:57.116 --> 02:00:58.384
ITS MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:02.555
THE COSTS RATEPAYERS PAY ARE

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:04.657
JUST. AND REASONABLE NOT THAT

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:07.593
PRIVATE CORPORATIONS MAKE MONEY.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.395
THIS BILL REMOVES THAT MANDATE

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:12.999
FROM CURRENT LAW. SECOND THIS

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:15.368
BILL ADDRESSES A GROWING

02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:18.237
PROBLEM OF COST SHIFTING. WE'RE

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:19.972
GOING GREEN IN THE STATE THAT

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.108
IS MANDATED BY LAW AND

02:01:22.174 --> 02:01:24.744
INDISPUTABLE THE QUESTION IS

02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:25.711
SHOULD WE PAY TWO TO THREE

02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:30.116
TIMES MORE TO GET THERE. AND I

02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:31.317
DON'T THINK SO AND I ASK FOR

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:33.486
YOUR EYE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT

02:01:33.552 --> 02:01:37.056

FIRST ACKNOWLEDGING. THE AUTHOR

OFFER NOT ONLY CHAMPIONING. V.

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:54.173
THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.642
ESPECIALLY OF OUR LOW INCOME

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:59.178
AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES I

02:01:59.245 --> 02:01:59.745
ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:01:59.812 --> 02:02:02.882
AUTHOR. FOR HER CHAMPIONING

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:04.984
MANY ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OVER

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:08.054
THE YEARS AND THAT. I DON'T

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.889
THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION AS

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:13.626
TO THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO

02:02:13.693 --> 02:02:15.861
FIGHTING AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:18.597
AND FIGHTING FOR CLEAN ENERGY.

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:20.466
BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE AND

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.001
THE REASON WHY I'M OPPOSING

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:24.470
THIS BILL. IS BECAUSE AT THIS

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:27.606
TIME WE'RE NOT SCIENTISTS ARE

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:30.943
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE- HOW

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.912
PERHAPS ALREADY PAST THE

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:35.314
TIPPING POINT IN TERMS OF OUR

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:37.049
FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:40.086
THAT WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING

02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:43.622
CLEAN ENERGY NOT ELIMINATING

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:44.824
WHAT IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST

02:02:44.890 --> 02:02:48.694
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS TO

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.429
INCENTIVIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR TO

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:53.866
INCENTIVIZE CLEAN ENERGY. FOR

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:56.035
MANY HOUSE WERE HUNDREDS OF

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:57.903
THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE

02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:01.841
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHOR

02:03:01.907 --> 02:03:03.709
RIGHTFULLY FOCUSES ON THE COST

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:07.079
SHIFT ISSUE AND AS A MEMBER OF

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:07.580
THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:10.583
COMMITTEE. WE HAD A ROBUST

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.051
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE COST

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.085
SHIFT ISSUE AND THERE'S NO

02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:15.821
DOUBT THAT THE COST SHIFT ISSUE

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:19.158
IS A REAL ISSUE. AND THAT.

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:21.761
WE'RE GETTING RUNNING OUT OF

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.629
PATIENCE MANY OF US HAVE RUN

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:25.197
OUT OF PATIENCE WITH. THE

02:03:25.264 --> 02:03:27.233
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:28.801
FIX THIS PROBLEM OF THE

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:32.304
CONCEPT. BUT LET'S REMEMBER.

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:35.741
THAT THE CONCEPT. ISSUE IN

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:36.942
TERMS OF THE COST COMING FROM

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:40.279
CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS. OF THE

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:43.249
WILDFIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS ALL

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:45.551
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:46.051
WE'RE SPENDING ON WATER

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:49.989
MITIGATION. ON IMPROVING ON

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:53.125
HARDENING THE GRID THOSE COSTS

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:58.264
FAR OUTWEIGH ANY ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:01.033
CREDITS THAT THE THAT FAMILIES

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.104
ARE RECEIVING. UNDER THE NET

02:04:05.171 --> 02:04:08.174
ENERGY METERING PROGRAM. THIS

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.676
IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:13.179
FIXED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:16.549
COMMISSION THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL.

02:04:16.615 --> 02:04:18.317
STAKEHOLDER STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:21.320
PROCESS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:24.156
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:27.493
ENGAGE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.129
WE NEED TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE

02:04:30.196 --> 02:04:32.865
WE SHOULD NOT BE ELIMINATING

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:35.234
ONE OF THE MOSTSUCCESSFUL

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:37.970
INCENTIVES TO TOWARD CLEAN

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:43.475
ENERGY AT THIS CRITICAL TIME.

02:04:43.542 --> 02:04:45.744
THANK YOU MYSTERIES HE DR QUIRK

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.646
IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.515
RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:52.117
BICKERING MEMBERS. THIS PROGRAM

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:55.120
I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:55.688
ELEVEN THIRTY NINE I'M A CO

02:04:55.754 --> 02:04:58.257
AUTHOR. I DON'T THINK THERE'S

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:01.060
ANYBODY IN HERE WHO KNOWS THESE

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:03.128
PROGRAMS BETTER THAN I DO.

02:05:03.195 --> 02:05:04.897
RIGHT NOW THE ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:08.300
PROGRAM IS HURTING US IN

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:10.469
MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.438
THE REASON IT'S HURTING US IS

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:13.839
THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:16.609
BEING DRIVEN UP THIS IN FACT IS

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:19.278
SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:20.179
PROGRAMS THAT WE JUST

02:05:20.246 --> 02:05:22.281
MENTIONED. BY THE MEMBER FROM

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:25.184
TORRANCE IT IS HIGHER BY

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:27.753
SEVERAL TIMES. THE ACTUAL OF

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.889
FORTY COST WHICH IS WHAT IS IN

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:32.791
THE BILL NOW WILL BE ALLOWED TO

02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:34.994
THESE PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES THE

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.330
SOCIAL COSTS. OF REDUCING

02:05:38.397 --> 02:05:42.234
POLLUTION ETCETERA BUT IF THESE

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.470
PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP AND

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:45.671
LET ME TELL YOU HOW EXTREME

02:05:45.738 --> 02:05:47.873
THIS YEAR'S THE CUSTOMERS IN

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:50.175
SAN DIEGO THE PEOPLE WITHTHE

02:05:50.242 --> 02:05:52.878
LOWEST INCOMES PAY A HUNDRED

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:55.014
DOLLARS A YEAR MORE FOR THEIR

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.548
ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF THIS

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:58.984
PROGRAM IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:01.120
ANY OTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE IT IS

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:03.789
TIME FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR TO

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:06.425
COMPETE. ON ITS OWN. IF IT'S A

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:09.662
GOOD TECHNOLOGY IF IT GETS THE

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.430
THINGS DONE IF WE GIVE IT THE

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:13.866
CREDIT IT SHOULD GAP. FINE I

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:15.968
ALSO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR WHEN

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:17.569
SHE SHOWS WE CAN'T TRUST THE P.

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:20.306
YOU SEE THE ACT BECAUSE FRANKLY

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:21.173
THEY WORRY MORE ABOUT THE

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:25.144
POLITICS THEN WE DO. THEY ARE

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:27.980
NOT RELIABLE NOW SHE IS GIVING

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.982
THEM I THINK IT'S NEXT SUMMER.

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:31.984
TO GET IT DONE SUMMER OF NEXT

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:35.287
YEAR. OF AND IF THEY GET IT

02:06:35.354 --> 02:06:37.423
DONE AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB

02:06:37.489 --> 02:06:39.358
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:41.026
RIGHT NOW THIS IS HURTING US IT

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:43.028
IS HURTING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IF

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.663
WE DON'T REDUCE THE COST OF

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:47.166
ELECTRICITY THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:48.100
GOING TO BE GETTING ELECTRIC

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.902
VEHICLES THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:51.503
BE GETTING ELECTRIC HEATING FOR

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:54.340
THEIR HOMES. THEY WILL BALK AT

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:56.775
THIS BECAUSE OF THE PRICES WE

02:06:56.842 --> 02:06:58.644
HAVE TO THINK IN EFFECT FOR THE

02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:01.113
CHAIR OF UTILITIES. THE MEMBER

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.282
FROM PASADENA. THERE IS A

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:06.652
WHOLE. FRAME THIS YEAR ON WE

02:07:06.719 --> 02:07:08.354
ARE NOT GOING TO INCREASE THE

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.589
PRICE OF ELECTRICITY AGAIN. IT

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:13.058
IS ALREADY TWO TO THREE TIMES

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:15.127
MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:17.596
WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:19.631
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WHAT

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:21.133
I CAN THINK OF BECAUSE IT IS

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.168
THE LARGEST IMBALANCE. PLEASE

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:27.973
VOTE YES ON. ELEVEN THIRTY NINE

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:31.977
THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR. MR

02:07:32.044 --> 02:07:33.212
STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ME

02:07:33.278 --> 02:07:35.581
DESK. THANK YOU THE SPEAKER.

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:37.816
MEMBERS THE IN. CAL HAS MADE

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:39.151
AND ROOFTOPS HAS BEEN OF THE

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:40.886
MOST SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:44.089
BENEFITS. OF MANY OF THE THINGS

02:07:44.156 --> 02:07:46.291
THAT WE HAVE DONE AND THAT

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:48.360
INVESTMENT THE INCENTIVES PUT

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:50.362
IN PLACE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:52.831
TO. PUT ROOFTOP SOLAR ON THEIR

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:55.134
HOMES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVEN

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.268
DOWN THE COST OF THE

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:57.469
INSTALLATION THE COST OF THE

02:07:57.536 --> 02:08:00.005
SOLAR PANELS. THAT PEACE HAS

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:02.174
REALLY WORK. WHAT WE NEED TO DO

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:04.243
NOW IS TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:06.678
INTO THE NEXT STEPS IN THE

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:07.980
SOLAR ROOF BY ATTACHING STORAGE

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:11.417
TO IT. BY ENSURING THAT WE CAN

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:14.053
DEVELOP MICRO GRIDS BY REALLY

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:15.621
ENFORCING THIS DISTRIBUTED

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.589
GENERATION MODEL THAT WE NEED

02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:20.426
TO DO. SO ROOFTOP SOLAR IS THAT

02:08:20.492 --> 02:08:23.362
IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AND TO

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:24.563
KEEP THOSE INVESTMENTS GOING.

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:27.866
BUT THE NET ENERGY METERING

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:29.935
THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE WAS

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:32.004
REALLY KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

02:08:32.071 --> 02:08:33.539
ROAD AND WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:35.707
THAT CAN. AND IT DID SO BECAUSE

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:37.976
IT WAS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO

02:08:38.043 --> 02:08:41.046
INVEST IN- GRAMS IN THE WAY WE

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:43.248
NORMALLY WOULD AND PROVIDE

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:44.950
INCENTIVES FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:49.888
MAYBE ADD AN EQUITABLE. PIECE

02:08:49.955 --> 02:08:52.291
OF OUR ELECTRICITY BILL TO BE

02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:53.425
ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:54.159
INCENTIVES TO KEEP A ROOF TOP

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:57.596
pTO DO WAS JUST BUILD IT INTO

02:08:57.663 --> 02:09:01.633
THE RATES AND STERN THAT GREAT

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.267
THAT INCENTIVE TO MOVE IT

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:04.503
FORWARD. THAT INCENTIVE NOW

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.205
WORKS AGAINST ALL OF THE OTHER

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:08.307
CLIMATE GOALS THAT WE HAVE THAT

02:09:08.373 --> 02:09:09.608
INCENTIVE NOW BECAUSE OF THE

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:11.510
SUCCESS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR HAS

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:13.278
ENDED UP WITH A THREE BILLION

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:15.581
DOLLAR COST SHIFT. SO IT HAS TO

02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:18.050
BE ADDRESSED AND IT HAS TO BE

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:20.352
ADDRESSED. NOW ENDED THE DRILL

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.154
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:24.123
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:26.358
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY IS

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:27.793
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IS AS

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:30.028
APPROPRIATE LOOKING AT WHAT WE

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:31.396
SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.731
ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:35.033
CONTINUE TO DO THAT. VERMEILLE

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.636
JUSTICE POLICY ALSO ASKED THE

02:09:37.703 --> 02:09:39.771
QUESTION WHO'S PAYING. AND

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:42.407
WHO'S BEING LEFT BEHIND. AND

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:44.743
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THIS COST

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:46.678
SHIFT WE ARE LEAVING.

02:09:46.745 --> 02:09:48.413
COMMUNITIES BEHIND AND PUTTING

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.349
ADDITIONAL COSTS ON COMMUNITIES

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:51.483
WHO WERE NOT SET UP TO BEAR

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:55.020
THIS CAR. SO IN THIS BILL

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:57.523
COUPLE OF THIGS THAT THAT ARE

02:09:57.589 --> 02:10:00.159
NOT ADDRESS IS HOW WE DEVELOP

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:02.628
THAT NEXT INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IT

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:03.195
WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BILL TO

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:05.330
BEGIN WITH. AND IT WAS TAKEN

02:10:05.397 --> 02:10:06.798
OUT. AND UNFORTUNATELY

02:10:06.865 --> 02:10:08.767
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PUT INTO

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:10.202
THE BILL ALONG THE WAY WERE

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:12.104
VERY REFLECTED WHAT THE

02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:13.906
INDUSTRY WAS ASKING FOR BECAUSE

02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:16.241
WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS PAY

02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:17.643
FOR SOLAR ROOFTOP GENERATED

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:20.279
INDUSTRY. L. GENERATION AT THE

02:10:20.345 --> 02:10:21.613
LOWEST POSSIBLE RATE WELL

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.348
THAT'S NOT FAIR. THEY ALSO

02:10:23.415 --> 02:10:25.284
WANTED TO ATTACH AN ARBITRARY

02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:27.986
FEE FOR THE PLEASURE OF

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:28.787
CONNECTING TO THE SYSTEM. WELL

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.923
THAT'S NOT FAIR EITHER THOSE

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:32.191
PIECES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT

02:10:32.257 --> 02:10:35.594
FORTUNATELY. SO FOR ME MOVING

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:38.630
AHEAD WITH BREAKING DOWN THE

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:41.466
INEQUITIES IN THE NET ENERGY

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:44.570
METERING RATE STRUCTURE IS

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.305
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WE

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:48.140
NEED TO SEND A SIGNAL WHICH

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:50.275
THIS BILL DOES TO THE PC TO GET

02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:52.277
IT DONE TO GET IT DONE NOW BUT

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:54.012
NOT EXCEED TO WHAT THE INDUSTRY

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.514
WANTS TO DO WHICH IS THE REAL

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.482
THREAT TO ROOFTOP SOLAR. IS

02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:58.850
CHARGED ALL THESE ADDITIONAL

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.452
FEES AND SUCH THAT THOSE

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:02.387
INVESTMENTS CANNOT AND DO NOT

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:04.856
PAY OFF OVER TIME SO NOT ONLY

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:06.858
DOES THIS BILL PROTECT LEGACY

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:08.927
INSTALLED SYSTEM. BUT IF THE

02:11:08.994 --> 02:11:10.529
RATE STRUCTURE IS CORRECT THEN

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:13.665
IT WILL STILL ALLOW FOR.

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:14.967
SOMEONE WHO PUTS ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:11:15.033 --> 02:11:17.469
ON TO RECOUP THAT INVESTMENT IN

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:19.605
THE APPROPRIATE WAY BUT WE HAVE

02:11:19.671 --> 02:11:21.340
TO DO MORE. WE NEED TO

02:11:21.406 --> 02:11:23.408
INCENTIVIZE STORAGE AS A PART

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:26.912
OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND WE NEED

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.647
TO ENSURE THAT THAT THOSE

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:30.349

02:11:30.415 --> 02:11:33.585
WE ARE WE ARE. PUTTING TOGETHER

02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:35.220
THAT THOSE INCENTIVES. TO

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:38.390
CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:40.726
DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND THE

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:42.527
ABILITY TO DEVELOP MICRO GRIDS

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:43.962
AND BREAK OUR DEPENDENCE ON

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:46.031
THESE LONG TRANSMISSION LINES

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:48.800
THAT OR REALLY HOW THESE THESE.

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.402
COMPANIES MAKE MOST OF THEIR

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:53.472
MONEY OVER TIME AND PUT A CAP

02:11:53.538 --> 02:11:57.009

SPIRALING GROWTH OF ELECTRICITY

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:01.613
RATES. IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:02.814
THAT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:05.017
MOVE TO ELECTRIC HOMES IT

02:12:05.083 --> 02:12:06.852
UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO PUSH

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:09.554
THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PROGRAM TO

02:12:09.621 --> 02:12:12.224
THE EXTENT THAT WE REALLY NEED

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.326

02:12:14.393 --> 02:12:16.194
FOR ONE OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:18.130
REALLY WHAT THE QUESTION IS WE

APPROACHING TWO BILLION DOLLARS

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:58.163
ANNUALLY THIS MEANS THAT

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:50.095
CHATTER ABOUT THE DAY I WAS

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:52.797

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:55.600
LETTER FROM A CONSTITUENT.

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:57.302

02:17:57.369 --> 02:17:58.570
PITTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

FAMILIES VERSUS SAVING OUR

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.310
PLANET THIS IDEA THAT ONLY THE

WEALTHY CAN AFFORD SOLAR PANELS.

02:18:07.545 --> 02:18:08.847

WORKING FAMILIES AND UTILITY

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:13.284

BUT THEY'RE ALSO FOLKS WHO TOOK

02:18:14.719 --> 02:18:16.988
FROM THEIR RETIREMENT. TO PAY

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.690

PROMISE THAT IT WOULD PAY FOR

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:21.793

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:25.864
ALSO TRUE. IT WAS A MISTAKE

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.365

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:40.712
PUBLIC UTILITY COSTS ON WORKING

02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:43.014
FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE TO

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:45.083
INCENTIVIZE SOLAR INVESTMENTS

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:46.551

SERIOUS WAY WE MAY PROMISES TO

WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYBODY TO

02:18:57.162 --> 02:18:59.297
MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT THIS IDEA

02:18:59.364 --> 02:19:00.398
THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:01.966
ECONOMIC JUSTICE HAVE TO COME

02:19:02.033 --> 02:19:02.567
HEAD TO HEAD MEANS THAT WE'VE

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.202
ALREADY FAILED. AND WE CAN DO

02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:06.871
BETTER. THIS BILL TAKES US BACK

02:19:06.938 --> 02:19:09.140
TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THIS BILL

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:10.041

BY THE UTILITIES AND FOR THE

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:39.537
UTILITIES AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.872
LET ME START BY JUST JUST ASK

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:44.976
YOURSELF. IF THIS BILL PASSES

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:45.744
DO YOU THINK THAT THE UTILITIES

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:48.580
ARE GONNA LOWER YOUR RATES.

02:19:48.646 --> 02:19:51.649
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. ALL I'VE

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:52.884
SEEN AS RATES CONTINUE TO GO UP

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:55.754
IN THE STATE. IT HAS BEEN SAID

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.722
WE PAY 80% MORE AS A

02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:58.823
RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER IN

02:19:58.890 --> 02:20:01.493
CALIFORNIA THAN PEOPLE ANYWHERE

02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:04.329
ELSE. IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:05.797
OF THESE UTILITIES IS

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:07.465
RESPONSIBLE FOR BURNING DOWN AN

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:11.703
ENTIRE TOWN. IN MY DISTRICT.

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.671
THE VERY NEXT YEAR THEY RAISED

02:20:13.738 --> 02:20:18.343
OUR RATES. LET'S TALK ABOUT

02:20:18.409 --> 02:20:20.044
RATES AND WHY THEY'RE SO HIGH

02:20:20.111 --> 02:20:22.480
IT'S LAUGHABLE. TO HEAR PEOPLE

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:24.649
SAY THAT IS THE NAME PROGRAM

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:25.450
THAT IS CAUSING OUR RATES TO

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:27.118
BE SO HIGH THAT SHOWS THE

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:29.487
COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF WHAT'S

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:30.755
GOING ON WITH RATES AND WHY

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:31.790
THEY'RE SO HIGH LET'S START

02:20:31.856 --> 02:20:33.925
WITH R. P. S. YEAH WE ALL LIKE

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:36.060
IT BECAUSE IT REQUIRES

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.662
RENEWABLE INVESTMENTS. BUT GO

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:40.031
BACK IN HISTORY. TO GET ALL

02:20:40.098 --> 02:20:42.200
THIS STARTED. MULTI MILLION

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:45.136
DOLLAR COMPANIES BUILT UTILITY

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:48.039
SCALE SOLAR. THAT WE ENTERED

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:49.941
INTO CONTRACTS WITH LONG TERM

02:20:50.008 --> 02:20:51.843
CONTRACTS WITH THAT VERY HIGH

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.778
PRICES WE'RE STILL PAYING ON

02:20:53.845 --> 02:20:55.680
THOSE CONTRACTS NOT AT MARKET

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:58.683
RATES TODAY. LOW SOLAR BUT AT

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:01.019
THOSE RATES THOSE RATES IN

02:21:01.085 --> 02:21:03.721
THOSE CONTRACT RATES MULTI

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:05.824
MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES. THAT

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:06.724
ARE MAKING MONEY RIGHT NOW

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:08.827
TODAY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:11.563
BIGGEST REASONS WHY YOUR RATES

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:15.667
ARE SO HIGH. BUT IT DID HAVE A

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.035
POSITIVE EFFECT IN SOME PEOPLE

02:21:17.101 --> 02:21:18.570
OF ALLUDED TO IT BY MAKING

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.705
THOSE INVESTMENTS. AND BY THE

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:21.906
MILLION SOLAR ROOFTOP

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:24.242
INITIATIVE IT BROUGHT THE COST

02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:26.010
OF SOLAR DOWN SO THAT MIDDLE

02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:27.712
CLASS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.547
COULD FINALLY AFFORD IT.

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:30.748
BECAUSE BACK THEN THEY COULDN'T

02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:32.483
THE RATE THAT THE COST WAS SO

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:35.353
HIGH. THOSE INVESTMENTS MADE IT

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:35.887
SO THAT THEY COULD FINALLY

02:21:35.954 --> 02:21:38.790
AFFORD IT. AND NOW MANY OF DONE

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:41.559

CREDITS THAT THEY WERE PROMISED

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:01.005
WHEN THEY DID IT. IS A PART OF

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:01.639
THE REASON THEY DECIDED TO MAKE

02:23:01.706 --> 02:23:04.175
THAT DECISION. AS A GENTLEMAN

BETTER WAY TO DO THAT MORE

02:23:29.133 --> 02:23:30.535
EQUAL WAY TO DO THAT LET'S HAVE

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:32.003
THAT CONVERSATION. BUT DON'T

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:34.405
PICK ON ONE PROGRAM. THE BY THE

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:34.872

BECAUSE YOU'RE I AGREE WITH YOU

02:24:51.249 --> 02:24:53.217
THEY ARE WAY TOO HIGH. BUT

02:24:53.284 --> 02:24:54.652
LET'S DO SO THE REAL LET'S DO

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:55.920
SOME REAL REFORMS NOT PICK ON

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:59.590
ONE PROGRAM. AND HURT LOW

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:00.725
INCOME AND MIDDLE CLASS

02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:01.793
FAMILIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.628
SOLAR IN THE STATE I URGE A NO

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:06.097

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT

02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:15.373
TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THE

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:17.642
TRAGEDY IN PARADISE IS ONE THAT

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:19.644
WE WILL REMEMBER FOREVER IT WAS

02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:21.579
A TRAGEDY AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:25:21.646 --> 02:25:23.948
THAT WE MUST LOOK TO REMEDY IN

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:26.317
SOME WAY BUT I WANT TO GET BACK

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.753
TO THIS BILL. THIS PARTICULAR

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:31.622
BILL AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE IS A

02:25:31.689 --> 02:25:33.624
BILL THAT I SUPPORT. AND I WANT

02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:34.125
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:36.027
CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:37.228
EQUITY ISSUE IN FOR WORKING

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:39.197
WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP MEET

02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:41.566
THEIR CONCERNS. INCLUDING

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:43.868
GRANDFATHERING THOSE WHO GOT

02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:45.970
SOLAR BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:48.473
WILL EXTEND TWENTY YEARS FOR

02:25:48.539 --> 02:25:50.908
THOSE. WHO HAD ALREADY

02:25:50.975 --> 02:25:53.177
INSTALLED THEIR SOLAR. ROOFTOP

02:25:53.244 --> 02:25:55.046
SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:56.781
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL DUE IN

02:25:56.848 --> 02:25:58.249
PART TO THE MANY EARLY ADOPTERS

02:25:58.316 --> 02:26:00.118
WHO COMMITTED TO CLEAN AND

02:26:00.184 --> 02:26:03.554
RENEWABLE ENERGY. HOWEVER AS

02:26:03.621 --> 02:26:05.456
HAS BEEN STATED BY SO MANY.

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:08.126
THEIR SERIOUS INEQUITY THERE IS

02:26:08.192 --> 02:26:09.994
THERE IS A SERIOUS INEQUITY

02:26:10.061 --> 02:26:11.562
WHEN IT COMES TO NOW TO ENERGY

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:14.165
METERING AND THE STRUCTURE AND

02:26:14.232 --> 02:26:15.967
THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. THE COST

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:18.236
BURDEN CANNOT CONTINUE TO FALL

02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:19.804
AND LOW INCOME AND

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:21.672
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OF

02:26:21.739 --> 02:26:24.075
THE STATE CONTINUES TO MOVE

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:25.776
TOWARD CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY.

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:26.744
IT MUST DO SO IN AN EQUITABLE

02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:30.448
MANNER. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE

02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:31.115
WILL STRIKE A BALANCE OF

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:33.384
REFORMING THE NOT TO ENERGY

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:36.387
METERING STRUCTURE. IF THE P.

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:38.923
YOU SEE FAILS TO ACT AND UP TO

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:40.324
NOW THEY HAVE FAILED TO ACT BUT

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.659
IT STILL ALLOWS THAT

02:26:41.726 --> 02:26:43.928
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CPUC CARE

02:26:43.995 --> 02:26:47.598
ACT. WELL WILL STILL REASSURE.

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:50.067
EARLY SOLAR ADOPTERS THAT THEIR

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:52.670
COMMITMENT TO INSTALLING SOLAR

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:54.839
WAS NOT IN VAIN. THIS BILL

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:56.073
WOULD ALSO ENSURE THE FUTURE

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:59.010
PROJECTS CONNECTED TO THEM. PAY

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:01.412
THEIR WORKERS A PREVAILING WAGE

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:03.381
IT IS FOR ALL THESE REASONS I

02:27:03.447 --> 02:27:03.948
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:09.754
VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES.

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:12.223
SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:14.926
RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. MS

02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:17.195
GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE THANK

02:27:17.261 --> 02:27:20.097
YOU I JUST WANNA- BE CLEAR

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:22.333
ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE.

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.203
MISGUIDED I WOULD SUGGEST- AND

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:27.138
UNDERSTANDABLY SO I THINK IF

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:30.041
YOU ARE. IT LIVED IN AN AREA

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:32.076
WITH A FIRE AND DO BLAME THE

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:33.978
UTILITIES AND I CAN UNDERSTAND

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:36.714
THAT I IT- NUMBER ONE HAVE

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:38.282
NEVER EVEN TALKED TO THE

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:41.252
UTILITIES ABOUT THIS BILL. AT

02:27:41.319 --> 02:27:42.920
THE SUGGESTION THAT I. CARRY

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.722
THE WATER OF A CORPORATION FOR

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:46.624
ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME IT'S ALMOST

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:51.996
LAUGHABLE. I DID TALK TO A LOT

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:53.698
OF PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BILL. AND

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:55.199
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MY OWN

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:56.767
PERSONAL DECISION TO GET

02:27:56.834 --> 02:28:00.204
ROOFTOP SOLAR IN WHO THAT COSTS.

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:01.339
AND I'M EMBARRASSED QUITE

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:03.207
FRANKLY I'M EMBARRASSED THAT I

02:28:03.274 --> 02:28:05.776
CONTINUE. TO BURDEN MY

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:09.513
NEIGHBORS. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:12.316
THOSE LARGE SCALE SOLAR. PLANTS

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:15.386
FARMS THEY ACTUALLY PRODUCE A

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:16.854
LOT CHEAPER THAN MY ROOF CAN

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:20.625
PRODUCE AT. IT BRINGS DOWN THE

02:28:20.691 --> 02:28:22.760
COST OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. BUT

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:24.128
EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT WE NEED

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:25.463
ALL OF THESE TO MEET OUR GOALS

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:28.633
AND WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING IN ANY

02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:29.200
WAY THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR ISN'T

02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:31.502
PART OF THAT. FOR THOSE FOLKS

02:28:31.569 --> 02:28:33.638
WHO SIGN A PPA. YOUR RATES ARE

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:34.672
LOCKED IN YOU DON'T GET THE

02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:36.374
NAME CREDIT YOU'RE GIVING THEM

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.845
CREDIT TO A LARGE CORPORATION.

02:28:40.911 --> 02:28:41.445
RUN BY THE RICHEST MAN IN THE

02:28:41.512 --> 02:28:45.449
WORLD. THAT'S WHO MY NEIGHBORS

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:48.085
ARE SUBSIDIZING. AND I KNOW IT

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:50.888
MIGHT BE EASIER FOR ME TO TAKE

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:52.690
THIS ON BECAUSE THE REALITY IS

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:55.726
LESS THAN 1% OF MY CONSTITUENTS

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:57.395
CAN AFFORD ROOFTOP SOLAR AND

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:59.764
HAVE IT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT.

02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:00.998
I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR

02:29:01.065 --> 02:29:04.168
EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR SOME OF

02:29:04.235 --> 02:29:07.371
YOU HAVE 15% BUT THE PEOPLE IN

02:29:07.438 --> 02:29:09.106
MY COMMUNITY SHOULDN'T BE

02:29:09.173 --> 02:29:12.109
PAYING FOR THAT. THIS IS THE

02:29:12.176 --> 02:29:15.279
BIGGEST COST THOSE WILDFIRE

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:16.714
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO PUT ON

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:23.220
REPAIRS. NOT SOLAR USERS. EVERY

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.623
TIME WE ADD COST IT'S SHIFTING

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:29.593
THE BURDEN. I AM COMPLETELY

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:30.194
COMMITTED TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:32.330
GOALS BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:33.097
TO HAVE THESE HARD

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:35.266
CONVERSATIONS WE CANNOT BE

02:29:35.333 --> 02:29:38.302
TALKING ABOUT SWITCHING TO A

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:40.404
100% ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WHEN

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:42.473
ELECTRICITY RATES CONTINUE TO

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.108
BE SHIFTED ON TO THE POOREST

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:46.077
FOLKS WHO NUMBER ONE CAN'T

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:48.612
AFFORD TO LET TRICITY NUMBER

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:49.847
TWO. CAN'T ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:50.981
NUMBER THREE DON'T HAVE A

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:52.216
CHARGING STATION I'LL NEVER

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:54.318
HAVE SOLAR ON THE ROOFTOPS.

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:57.021
WHAT ARE WE DOING. WHEN ARE WE

02:29:57.088 --> 02:29:58.322
GOING TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT

02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:00.491
HOW WE REACH THOSE GOALS IN A

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:01.692
REALISTIC WAY THAT DOESN'T PUT

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.494
ALL OF THE BIRD IN A WORKING

02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:06.197
CLASS FAMILIES. THOSE ARE MY

02:30:06.263 --> 02:30:08.265
CONSTITUENTS AND I WOULD GUESS

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:10.067
EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU IN

02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:11.469
WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THAT

02:30:11.535 --> 02:30:14.171
YOU'RE STILL. JUST BECAUSE THEY

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:15.005
THEY DIDN'T GET A LETTER FROM A

02:30:15.072 --> 02:30:16.640
SOLAR COMPANY TELLING THEM TO

02:30:16.707 --> 02:30:18.743
CONTACT YOU. KNOW WHAT NOBODY

02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:20.277
IS ORGANIZING THEM THAT'S OUR

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:25.549
JOB. TO PROTECT THEM. PEOPLE

02:30:25.616 --> 02:30:26.784
WHO BOUGHT PURCHASED SOLAR

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:28.486
UNDER A PROMISE ARE STILL GOING

02:30:28.552 --> 02:30:30.955
TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP ALL OF

02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:32.656
THEIR COSTS PLUS. AND QUITE

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:34.525
FRANKLY THIS BILL GOES AWAY IF

02:30:34.592 --> 02:30:35.993
THE P. YOU SEE JUST DOES THEIR

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:40.431
JOB. OR WE CAN WAIT. LIKE WE

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:44.201
DID FOR. THE SMART PHONES IN

02:30:44.268 --> 02:30:45.736
THE DEAF AND DISABLED TO

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:47.004
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM TO

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:50.241
TRIPS NINE YEARS NINE YEARS.

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:51.976
THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF

02:30:52.042 --> 02:30:53.978
RESPONSE WE GET FROM THE PUCT

02:30:54.044 --> 02:30:55.045
I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO PUSH THEM

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:56.647
ALONG I'M SORRY IT'S A HEARD

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:58.582
BILL I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO TALK

02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:00.151
ABOUT REAL EQUITY CONCERNS IN

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:02.453
ABOUT THE REAL WORKING POOR

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.922
CARE CUSTOMERS. ANOTHER THING

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:06.323
WE SUBSIDIZE THEIR RATES IN ONE

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:07.525
OF THE REASONS ARE RATES ARE

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:08.959
HIGH BUT CARE CUSTOMERS ARE

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:11.328
THEN TURNING AROUND AND SPENT

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:13.431
IN HAVING TO PAY FOR SOLAR BUT

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:14.832

AN UNSUSTAINABLE PERMANENT

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:26.444
UNDER CLASS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:29.213
LOOKING OUT FOR EVERYBODY. I

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.115
SPENT MANY YEARS AT ORGANIZED

WE CAN HAVE IT ALL WE CAN HAVE

02:31:35.986 --> 02:31:37.521
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:40.357
GOOD JOBS. TOOK A LOT OF CRAP

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:42.660
FOR THAT. BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:44.295
PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT I

02:31:44.361 --> 02:31:45.930
STILL DO ON THIS FLOOR WHEN I

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:47.565
VOTE FOR MANY OF THE

02:31:47.631 --> 02:31:48.165

RIGHT NOW. UNDER OUR NAME

RIGHTS AND WE NEED TO REFORM IT.

02:32:02.546 --> 02:32:03.514

DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:33.897
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LANCASTER

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:35.498
PALMDALE THINK THEY'RE VERY

02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:42.405
WHERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:44:42.472 --> 02:44:43.373
WE'VE ALL PROBABLY DONE IN OUR

02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:45.275
LIVES BUT I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK

02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:47.444
AROUND THIS BODY IN WONDER IF

02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:48.812
ANYBODY IN THIS BODIES EVER

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:51.081
BEEN CITED. I KNOW REGARDING

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:52.415
THE VEHICULAR QUOTE IT'S A VERY

02:44:52.482 --> 02:44:54.951
DIFFEREN SITUATION WHERE.

02:44:55.018 --> 02:44:56.753
PEOPLE DRIVE AT A CERTAIN SPEED

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.622
LIMIT AND WE PROBABLY ALL BEEN

02:44:58.688 --> 02:45:00.657
CITED FOR SO THAT SEEMS TO BE

02:45:00.724 --> 02:45:04.327
pMECHANISM THIS ONE HOWEVER

02:45:04.394 --> 02:45:06.162
SEEMS TO BE VERY INDISCRIMINATE

02:45:06.229 --> 02:45:08.265
SEEMS TO UNFORTUNATELY BE

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:09.699
DISPROPORTIONATELY HOPPING IN

02:45:09.766 --> 02:45:10.767
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SO

02:45:10.834 --> 02:45:12.469
CERTAINLY STARTS BEING ENFORCED

02:45:12.535 --> 02:45:13.036
OF THE POOR OTHER COMMUTERS

02:45:13.103 --> 02:45:15.138
NOT. I THINK WHAT WE DO HAT

02:45:15.205 --> 02:45:16.172
WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO

02:45:16.239 --> 02:45:18.375
SIMPLIFY THIS MAKE IT SO THAT

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:21.044
IT IS SIMPLER TO IMPLEMENT THAN

02:45:21.111 --> 02:45:24.080
TO BE ENFORCED ACROSS THE BOARD

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:25.682
MORE EQUALLY IN MORE EVENLY.

02:45:25.749 --> 02:45:27.517
WITHIN FOR COMMONSENSE MEASURE

02:45:27.584 --> 02:45:29.019
AND LIKE WE MENTIONED IN

02:45:29.085 --> 02:45:30.920
PARTICULAR THE STATE FIGHTS THE

02:45:30.987 --> 02:45:32.389
CITATIONS THAT I CITED WERE

02:45:32.455 --> 02:45:34.724
REALLY AROUND WITH ANGELES IN

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:35.892
LONG BEACH IN PARTICULAR

02:45:35.959 --> 02:45:37.227
BECAUSE WE DID HAVE STUDIES AND

02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:40.163
DID HAVE DATA SO AGAIN WE THINK

02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:41.164
THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH

02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:43.800
IT DOESN'T TAKE THE ABILITY OF

02:45:43.867 --> 02:45:48.471
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO. NOT ENFORCE.

02:45:48.538 --> 02:45:50.940
ADESTRA IN IRVINE. OR A VEHICLE

02:45:51.007 --> 02:45:53.076
VIOLATIONS I THINK WHAT IT DOES

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:55.712
IS IT SAYS. THAT PEDESTRIANS

02:45:55.779 --> 02:45:57.747
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSS THE

02:45:57.814 --> 02:45:58.381
STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF GETTING

02:45:58.448 --> 02:46:00.583
CITED. I TOTALLY AGREE WE DO

02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:02.585
NEED TO DO MORE AROUND THE

02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:04.321
VEHICLE ENFORCEMENT IN VEHICLE

02:46:04.387 --> 02:46:06.323
SPEED ARE COMPLETE SUPPORT THAT

02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:08.224
WE HAVE. IN OUR CITY BEEN

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:10.427
FORCING FOR A PILOT TO REDUCE

02:46:10.493 --> 02:46:12.529
THE- SPEED LIMIT TO REALLY

02:46:12.595 --> 02:46:15.165
REDUCE- AND REDUCE TRAFFIC AS

02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:16.666
WELL AS TO ARRIVE NOT VERY MUCH

02:46:16.733 --> 02:46:18.802
MITIGATE TRAFFIC. I THINK TO

02:46:18.868 --> 02:46:22.005
BLAME- PEDESTRIANS FOR GETTING

02:46:22.072 --> 02:46:24.574
HIT BY CARS IS- YOU KNOW I

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:25.709
DON'T WANT NOTHING THAT'S WHAT

02:46:25.775 --> 02:46:26.943
YOU SAID BUT I THINK THAT IS

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:28.411
NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH EITHER

02:46:28.478 --> 02:46:30.613
SO AGAIN. WE ARE THIS IS WHAT A

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.048
POINT WERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:33.717
THAT IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

02:46:33.783 --> 02:46:35.585
WALK. THE LAST THING THAT WE

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:37.354
SHOULD DO IS TO PENALIZE PEOPLE

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:38.855
FOR CROSSING THE STREET. WITH

02:46:38.922 --> 02:46:40.190

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:31.701
CALLING OUT FOR HELP WAS

02:53:31.768 --> 02:53:33.903
MURDERED ON HAN CAMERON FROM

02:53:33.970 --> 02:53:34.971
HIS FAMILY RIGHT HERE IN OUR

STATE SHOWS THAT POLICE

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:38.908
BRUTALITY AND THE FORCES THAT

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:43.212
WE HAVE STILL YET TO REFORM

02:53:43.279 --> 02:53:44.580

02:53:45.648 --> 02:53:46.883
SKIN COLORS ESPECIALLY ASIAN

02:53:46.949 --> 02:53:48.684
AMERICANS JUST AS MUCH ARE ARE

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:50.319
VULNERABLE THESE THINGS. AND

02:53:50.386 --> 02:53:51.220
THAT'S WHAT'S ON BOARD TO DO

02:53:51.287 --> 02:53:52.789
COMMONSENSE THINGS LIKE THIS TO

02:53:52.855 --> 02:53:55.024
BAN. THE VAN POSITIONAL

02:53:55.091 --> 02:53:57.393
ASPHYXIA. TO NOT MAKE IT SO

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:58.828
THAT SOMEONE HAS TO BE ASHAMED

02:53:58.895 --> 02:53:59.896
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LONGER

02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:01.464
BREED. AND THOSE ARE THE COMMON

02:54:01.531 --> 02:54:02.398
SENSE THINGS THAT THIS BILL IS

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:04.400
DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:07.036
ARE. NOT SUCCEEDED I'M NOT

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:08.137
CERTAINLY KILLED WHEN THEY

SHOULDN'T HAVE ESPECIALLY RAIN

02:54:09.739 --> 02:54:11.040
FURTHER FAMILY WHEN THEY'D BE

02:54:11.107 --> 02:54:12.475
NEED HELP THE MOST BECAUSE-

02:54:12.542 --> 02:54:14.243
WHEN PEOPLE CALL FOR NINE ONE

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:14.944
ONE TO CALL FOR HELP. THEY'RE

02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:16.479
CALLING FOR HELP THEY ARE NOT

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:18.247
HOPING THAT THAT WILL RESULT IN

02:54:18.314 --> 02:54:20.183
THEIR OWN TIME UNTIMELY DEMISE

02:54:20.249 --> 02:54:21.384
AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WHY I'M

02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:21.918
SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS A

02:54:21.984 --> 02:54:23.953
PROUD. CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL

SPEAKER MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY

02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:37.567
SAYING NO ONE SUPPORTS POLICE

02:54:37.633 --> 02:54:40.570
MISCONDUCT NO ONE SUPPORTS

02:54:40.636 --> 02:54:42.972
TRAGEDY. AND I WILL TELL YOU

02:54:43.039 --> 02:54:44.440
HERE'S HERE'S ONE UNIQUE THING

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:48.344
ABOUT POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. IT'S

02:54:48.411 --> 02:54:50.179
A VERY COMPLICATED- SORT OF

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:53.950
CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT THE IS IT

02:54:54.016 --> 02:54:55.651
THEMSELVES OF CERTAIN RESISTIVE

02:54:55.718 --> 02:54:57.687
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU HAVE. A

02:54:57.753 --> 02:55:02.859
SUSPECT. WHO- BECOMES EXTREMELY

02:55:02.925 --> 02:55:03.426
COMBATIVE AND IT IT DOESN'T

02:55:03.492 --> 02:55:06.195
ROUTINE BUT IT IT HAPPENS

02:55:06.262 --> 02:55:09.532
FAIRLY ON. REGULAR BASIS THAT

02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:12.335
YOU GET EXTREMELY VIOLENT AND

02:55:12.401 --> 02:55:14.937
RESISTIVE SUSPECTS. AND THAT

02:55:15.004 --> 02:55:18.708
REQUIRES INTERVENTION BY THOSE

02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:20.509
WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED TO

02:55:20.576 --> 02:55:22.011
PRESERVE THE PEACE AND RESTORE

02:55:22.078 --> 02:55:26.482
ORDER. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:55:26.549 --> 02:55:27.049
WHEN I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

02:55:27.116 --> 02:55:29.919
FOLKS IS. MANY OF YOU CAN

02:55:29.986 --> 02:55:32.488
IMAGINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH

02:55:32.555 --> 02:55:34.590
SOME PEOPLE RESIST. TO THE

02:55:34.657 --> 02:55:36.559
POINT TO WHERE THEY KICK OUT

02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:39.061
WINDOWS IN THE PATROL CAR. THEY

02:55:39.128 --> 02:55:41.130
CONTINUALLY SCREAM AND YELL

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:43.666
EVEN NO MATTER WHAT FORM OF

02:55:43.733 --> 02:55:46.035
INTERVENTION YOU TRY. SO WHAT

02:55:46.102 --> 02:55:48.504
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TO PUT ON

02:55:48.571 --> 02:55:50.573
LEG RESTRAINTS. UNLIKE

02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:52.742
RESTRAINTS COUPLED WITH HAND

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:56.946
RESTRAINTS. REQUIRE A SUSPECT

02:55:57.013 --> 02:56:02.184
TO REMAIN. STEADY AS THEY ARE

02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:04.220
INSTRUCTED IN THE BACK OF THE

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:06.455
PATROL CAR BECAUSE IF THEY MOVE

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:08.357
A CERTAIN DIRECTION THEY WILL

02:56:08.424 --> 02:56:10.626
SELF INFLICT THIS POSITIONAL

02:56:10.693 --> 02:56:14.797
ASPHYXIA THAT WE'RE REFERRING

02:56:14.864 --> 02:56:16.866
TO. THIS HAPPENS WAY MORE OFTEN

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:19.969
THAN IT SHOULD. BUT IT'S NOT

02:56:20.036 --> 02:56:23.439
THE PEACE OFFICERS FAULT. IT'S

02:56:23.506 --> 02:56:25.541
THE PERSON WHO HAS CHOSEN TO

02:56:25.608 --> 02:56:27.777
RESIST AND FIGHT AND NOT LISTEN

02:56:27.843 --> 02:56:29.545
TO INSTRUCTION THEY PUT

02:56:29.612 --> 02:56:31.647
THEMSELVES IN A VERY VERY GRAVE

02:56:31.714 --> 02:56:34.083
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY

02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.650
ARE TOLD THAT BUT YOU THINK

02:56:34.717 --> 02:56:36.385
THEY'RE LISTENING. IT'S NOT

02:56:36.452 --> 02:56:41.090
LIKELY. AND SO. TO BLAME

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:42.458
OFFICERS IN ALL INSTANCES OF

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:45.995
POLICE. NATIONALS PICTURE IS AN

02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:48.230
UNFAIR MANDATE. EVERYBODY

02:56:48.297 --> 02:56:51.100
UNDERSTANDS THE TRAGEDY OF

02:56:51.167 --> 02:56:53.302
GEORGE FLOYD I HAVE NOT HEARD

02:56:53.369 --> 02:56:56.072
ANY ADVOCATES SAYING THAT THAT

02:56:56.138 --> 02:56:58.741
WAS NOT AN EXTREME TRAGEDY.

02:56:58.808 --> 02:57:00.910
MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES THAT

02:57:00.977 --> 02:57:02.912
HAPPENED IN THE CUSTODY OF LAW

02:57:02.979 --> 02:57:05.781
ENFORCEMENT ARE REGRETTABLE AND

02:57:05.848 --> 02:57:08.284
SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.

02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:11.253
BUT TO SAY THE POSITIONAL

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:13.255
ASPHYXIA IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:15.791
THE FAULT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:57:15.858 --> 02:57:18.794
ALSO EXTREMELY UNFAIR. UNWISE

02:57:18.861 --> 02:57:21.564

PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:58:27.229 --> 02:58:28.564
OFFICERS FROM USING HARMFUL

02:58:28.631 --> 02:58:31.834
TECHNIQUES THAT PUT INDIVIDUALS

02:58:31.901 --> 02:58:33.836
AT RISK OF A FIXATION. I

02:58:33.903 --> 02:58:36.238
PROBABLY WANTED A FEW HERE.

02:58:36.305 --> 02:58:38.407
THAT NO FORTY YEARS AGO. THERE

02:58:38.474 --> 02:58:42.344
WAS THIS CHIEF OF POLICE NAME

02:58:42.411 --> 02:58:46.115
DEROGATE. AND WHEN IT CAME TO

02:58:46.182 --> 02:58:47.950
THE CHOKEHOLD AT THAT TIME.

02:58:48.017 --> 02:58:49.852
CHIEF GAVE THOUGHT IT WAS

02:58:49.919 --> 02:58:51.687
SHOWING COMPASSION AND

02:58:51.754 --> 02:58:54.790
SENSITIVITY. WHEN HE ASKED HIS

02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:58.227
AIDES TO CONFIRM HIS HUNT.

02:58:58.294 --> 02:59:01.363
MERCED HUNCH. THAT BLACKS MIGHT

02:59:01.430 --> 02:59:03.666
NOT RECOVER AS QUICKLY AS

02:59:03.732 --> 02:59:07.269
WHITES FROM CAROTID CHUCKLES.

02:59:07.336 --> 02:59:09.171
WE MAY BE FINDING THAT IN SOME

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:12.708
BLACKS WHEN IT THE CHOKEHOLD IS

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:17.079
APPLIED THE VEINS AND ARTERIES

02:59:17.146 --> 02:59:21.283
DO NOT OPEN AS FAST AS THEY DO

02:59:21.350 --> 02:59:24.420
IN NORMAL PEOPLE. THAT WAS

02:59:24.487 --> 02:59:28.858
FORTY YEARS AGO. NINETEEN

02:59:28.924 --> 02:59:29.925
EIGHTY TWO. AND YOU HAD THE

02:59:29.992 --> 02:59:31.460
CHIEF OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:59:31.527 --> 02:59:35.197
AGENCY THAT BELIEVES. THAT

02:59:35.264 --> 02:59:36.332
PROBABLY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT

02:59:36.398 --> 02:59:38.667
AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE NORMAL

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:40.970
PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THEY DIED

02:59:41.036 --> 02:59:43.205
DURING THAT TIME. NOT BLAMING

02:59:43.272 --> 02:59:45.307
THE OFFICER PROBABLY NINE

02:59:45.374 --> 02:59:47.877
BLAMING HIMSELF. AND I THINK

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:50.679
WHAT EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO DO

02:59:50.746 --> 02:59:52.581
IS COME UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY.

02:59:52.648 --> 02:59:56.552
THAT WILL NOT. ULTIMATELY HURT

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:59.688
AND KILL ANYONE THAT'S INVOLVED

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:01.590
IN A POLICE ALTERCATION I

03:00:01.657 --> 03:00:03.893
NOTICED TRUE FROM A VICE CHAIR

03:00:03.959 --> 03:00:07.029
OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WHAT WE DO

03:00:07.096 --> 03:00:07.530
HAVE TO DO IS MAYBE COME

TOGETHER. AND TALK WITH EXPERTS

03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:15.771

WHATEVER METHODOLOGY TO IT TO

03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:20.442
MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE

03:00:20.509 --> 03:00:23.679
ULTIMATELY DICE. BECAUSE AS

03:00:23.746 --> 03:00:24.180
CHIEF CASE WAS TRYING TO

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:27.683
EXPLAIN. HE WAS TRYING TO BLAME

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:30.653
IT ON THE PERSON. NOT THE

03:00:30.719 --> 03:00:33.022
