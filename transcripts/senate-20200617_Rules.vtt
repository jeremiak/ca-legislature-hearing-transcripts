00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.248
VACCINE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.383
OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU KNOW THE

APPOINTMENTS AS WELL- AND WE

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:17.976
DID AN ANALYSIS IN APRIL AND WE

DOWN ABOUT 40% WHICH IS

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:24.249
INCREDIBLY CONCERNING TO US SO

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.951
LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFERENT

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:21.386
RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT THAT

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:27.759
FIRST ANTICIPATED OUR- IN SPITE

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.394
THAT WE- THOUGHT THAT COULD IF

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.862
DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. AND IN

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.230
FACT WE SEEN WHAT HAVE ENOUGH

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:35.300
PLACES THE WORLD- I THEY DIDN'T

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.401
HAVE THE TYPE OF ORDER THAT WE

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:37.735
HAD IN PLACE EARLY AND OFTEN

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.771
DIDN'T SLOW. POPULATION

00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:40.905
MOVEMENT DOWN SO THAT'S HOW I

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.774
WOULD RECONCILE THE TWO I WOULD

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.209
RECONCILE IT BY GIVING CREDIT

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:45.376
TO CALIFORNIANS I WOULD REMIND

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.778
US ALL THAT IT'S NOT OVER YET.

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:48.246
I'M WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:51.316
WHERE- WE ARE CONTINUING TO

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:53.751
WATCH THE DATA AND THINGS ARE

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:56.120
VERY STABLE- BUT THAT IS

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.556
THAT'S- WHY WHERE WE ARE NOW IS

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.091
SO DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE WERE

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:03.528
WHEN WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.495
WITH YOU BACK. EARLIER IN MARCH

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:09.133
BREAK THE. KNWING WE KNOW. IN

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.535
THE CLASS DAMAGE AN FOR.

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.337
INFLICTED NOT SECOND. BUT

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.738
SOCIAL SO WHERE THERE'S MENTAL

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.173
HEALTH ISSUES TO. A CHICKEN

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.774
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:18.543
SUICIDE IN ALCOHOL AND DRUG

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.111
ADDICTION. FROM THE STATE HOME

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.779
ORDER. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:23.715
CLOSING THE STATE AGAIN SHOULD

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.717
WE SEE AN INCREASE IN CASES.

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:26.417
AND IF SO WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.686
CRITERIA AND OR BENCHMARKS THAT

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.722
YOU WOULD USE TO DETERMINE

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:33.191
CLOSURE. SO WE HAVE PLAYED OUT

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:35.059
INDICATORS THAT WE ARE USING AT

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.527
THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP US

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:39.731

COUNTIES ARE COUNTIES ALSO NOW

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:05.356
HAVE ASSUME TOO MUCH MORE

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.325
RESPONSIBILITY AND PREPAREDNESS

KNOW NOW WOULD WE HAVE BEEN

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:26.871
BETTER OFF ESTABLISHING SOCIAL

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.239
DISTANCING STANDARDS AND

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.408
QUARANTINING THOSE THAT WE KNEW

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:31.676
WERE MOST VULNERABLE THE

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:32.744
ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.482
UNDERLYING HEALTH ISSUES SWEDEN

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.483
DID. THEN ORDERING THIS AT HOME

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:40.885
ORDER. SO YOU KNOW WE EARLY ON

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.787
OUR STATE HOME ORDER INCLUDED

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.722
VARIES A CLEAR LANGUAGE THAT

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:47.859
PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER- HAVE

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:49.894
COMORBIDITIES SHOULD SHOULD

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.829
STAY AT HOME AND THAT PROVISION

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.798
HAD STAYS HAS STAYED IN PLACE

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:56.100
EVEN WITH THE GRADUAL LIFTING

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.902
OF OUR STAY AT HOME ORDERS OUR

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.137
STATE HOME ORDERS ARE PUT IN

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.972
PLACE HOWEVER AT THAT TIME

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.473
BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.276
POPULATION MOVE. WE WERE SEEING

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:06.944
THE GROWTH AND NEXT WILL GROW

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.246
THICKER IS STARTING TO GO IN

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:09.747
THAT THAT WE KNOW IN

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.749
EPIDEMIOLOGY SHOWS THAT YOU ARE

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:14.051
AT YOUR HAVING A RATE THAT THAT

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:17.088
REQUIRES ACTION AND SO YOU KNOW

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.857
I FEEL LOOKING BACK AT WHERE WE

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:21.993
WERE AND THE ACTION THAT WE

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.461
TOOK THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.030
THING TO DO. AT THE TIME WE ARE

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.765
AND I AM STILL BELIEVE THAT IT

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:32.603
WAS IT IS THE RIGHT THING I

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.505
THAT WE DID ALSO. THANK YOU

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:35.840
WHAT A MOVE ON TO SEE TO THE IS

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.376
FROM ONE OF MY LOCAL BOARD.

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:41.546
DAVE NOW SENATE TO PRINT SIR.

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:42.580
IN BEING GETTING INTO FROM THE-

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:45.650
AND 50% 50% OF PARENTS WHAT

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.051
THEIR THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:49.454
SCHOOL AND 50% DON'T. AND ABOUT

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.556
15% SAY THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.458
COMING BACK TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:55.259
SO MY QUESTION I GUESS WOULD BE

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.527
WHAT QUESTIONS IN DATA SHOULD

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:59.530
FAMILIES CONSIDER ON WHETHER TO

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.097
SEND THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:03.534
SCHOOL. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:06.504
A VIRUS THAT IS NEW TO US AND

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.072
THINGS THAT ARE NEW. AND COME

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:12.276
WITH UNKNOWNS- CAN LEAVE PEOPLE

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:14.445
FEELING A LITTLE BIT. SCARED

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:17.448
SOMETIMES AND ALSO ANXIOUS AND

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:18.649
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.184
THING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.719
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.821
HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:24.822
THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT THAT

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.991
BEST DECISIONS FOR THEM AND FOR

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.593
THEIR CHILDREN I WILL TELL YOU

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.994
THAT OVER THE YOU KNOW WE

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:32.463
RELEASED A GUIDANCE. FOR THE

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.598
WAYS IN WHICH SCHOOLS WILL BE

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:38.035
REORGANIZED TO AT- TO HELP

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:39.904
REDUCE THE RISK OF INFECTION

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.172
AND OVER THE COMING WEEKS

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.740
BEFORE SCHOOLS OPEN IT WILL BE

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.375
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:46.010
PARENTS TO SPEAK IN PARTICULAR

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:48.045
WITH. WTH THEIR- LOCAL PUBLIC

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:49.547
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:50.948
SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.683
WHAT CHANGES WERE PUT IN PLACE

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.485
AND TO THINK VERY CLEARLY

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:57.221
ABOUT. ABOUT A WHAT'S BEST FOR

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:58.122
THEIR CHILDREN BUT I WILL TELL

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:01.826

THE AND WEALTHY OF ARCH. AND

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:13.404
OUR AND- WOULD NOT BE. AND TING

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.906
IT WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE AT

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.575
THE RIGHT TIME COMES OF THE

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:20.945

SEVENTEENTH. YET ARE WONDERFUL-

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.461
COUNTY STATE FAIRS WHICH HAVE A

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.230
LARGE YOUTH EDUCATIONAL

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.065

HAVE ANY IDEA WELL WHEN THOSE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:11.008
MIGHT OCCUR. SO I DON'T HAVE SO

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.143
WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS IS

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.978
REALLY FOLLOWING THE DAY SO I

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:17.081
ALSO- THE DATE THAT YOU HAVE

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:20.151
ABOUT- PARKS OPENING AND OTHERS

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:21.919
WE WILL NEED TO CONFIRM ALL OF

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.921
THAT- AND WE DON'T HAVE A

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:26.457
SPECIFIC DATE. OUT OUTSIDE FOR

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:27.491
THESE OTHER SECTORS RIGHT NOW

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:28.659
WE'RE FOLLOWING THE DATA AND

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:31.262
HAS IT BECOMES AS WE RECOGNIZE.

00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:32.229
THAT DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.031
READY TO OPEN AND THEN WE'LL

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:34.698
MAKE THAT INFORMATION

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.700
AVAILABLE. SO WHAT'S THE

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:40.004
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FAIR IN

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.571
LET'S SAY MAGIC MOUNTAIN OR

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:42.439
DISNEY LAND. YEAH SO THE

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:46.377
GUIDANCE FOR- FOR- PARKS TO

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:50.047
OPEN HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.882
OKAY I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:55.152
OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU.

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.621
MOVING ON THIS IS FROM NUMBER

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:58.255
QUESTIONS FROM AND ANOTHER

00:40:58.322 --> 00:41:00.858
SENATOR SO- WHY ARE WE NOT

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.426
DOING REGULAR SCIENTIFICALLY

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.128
MONITOR TESTS ARE RANDOM

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:06.030
SAMPLES OF THE POPULATION TO

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.364
SHOW THE EXTENT OF A

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.233
SYMPTOMATIC INFECTIONS OVER ON

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.003
SECTIONS AND THE RATE OF SPREAD.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.105
SO THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PUBLIC

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:16.106
HEALTH PRACTICE TO DO

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.842
SURVEILLANCE TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.877
SPREAD OF DISEASE ONE OF THE

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.946
BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:24.515
OUR- IN GAME CALIFORNIA AND

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.150
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAS

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.052
BEEN VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES AND

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:30.454
LACK OF ACCESS TO TESTING. SO

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:32.857
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS VERY

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:35.125
PROACTIVE CREATING A TESTING

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:37.728
TASK FORCE WHICH HAS WORKED

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:40.097
AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH PRIVATE

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.066
PART OF PRIVATE PUBLIC

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:43.667
PARTNERSHIPS WORKING WITH OUR-

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:45.169
ACADEMIC PARTNERS AS WELL TO

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.304
REALLY RAMP UP TESTING AND

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.340
TODAY WE ARE AT OUR GOAL AND WE

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.008
CONTINUE TO INCREASE WERE OVER

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.509
SIXTY THOUSAND. TEST THE DAY

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:54.578
WHICH IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE WE

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:56.213
NEEDED TO HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.916
HOWEVER TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.818
PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:01.819
INFORMATION FOR A MEDICAL

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.587
DECISION MAKING AND ALSO WE

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:05.623
PRIORITIZED FRONT LINE HEALTH

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:08.259
CARE WORKERS. AND OTHERS AROUND

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.527
CONCRETE SETTINGS ON IT TO MAKE

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:11.562
SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE AT

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:12.863
GREATEST RISK WOULD BE

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.099
PROTECTED SO THAT IS WHERE WE

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.967
HAVE TARGETED OUR TESTING TO

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:20.137
DATE. AS HAS BECOME MORE

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.505
AVAILABLE WE ARE PUTTING IN

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.540
PLACE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS JUST

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.209
TO WHAT YOU ARE SPEAKING TO

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.143
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.512
UNDERSTAND BETTER THE SPREAD OF

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:32.283
DISEASE ACROSS THE STATE. GOOD

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:33.751
IDEA OF WHERE I CLOSE NINETY

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:35.853
THE HIGH SPOTS ARE BECAUSE OF

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.322
WHEN THERE IS- TESTING NEEDED.

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.924
A FAIR AMOUNT OF TESTING GETS

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.525
DONE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.594
LEVEL AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.129
BEEN CUT FOLLOWING- THE TEST

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.031
POSITIVITY WHICH HELPS US

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.433
UNDERSTAND. THE KEEPING KEEPING

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.734
IN MIND ALSO THE LEVEL OF

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.470
TESTING. THAT THE RATE OF-

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.905
CASES IN A COUNTY AND THAT'S

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:56.240
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AT THE

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.775
COUNTY LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:59.009
AND WILL BE MOVING FORWARD AND

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:01.312
YOU'LL HEAR MORE. FROM US- IN

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.780
IN THE IN THEIR NEW YOU'RE NEAR

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:05.649
FUTURE ABOUT SURVEILLANCE AND-

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:06.750
MORE INFORMATION THA WILL BE

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:08.185
COMING AS TESTING BECOMES MORE

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.687
BROADLY IS AVAILABLE GREAT

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.622
THANK YOU. I NURSING HOMES

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.890
VULNERABILITIES HAVE BEEN KNOWN

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.358
FOR MONTHS DESPITE THING THAT

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.627
THEY ARE PRIORITY FOR TESTING

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.329
WHERE WE ARE TESTING EVERY

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:19.029
RESIDENTS STEP PERSON ON A

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:23.233
REGULAR BASIS. SO IT OF IT IS

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.502
BECAUSE OF THE- PRIOR VERY

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.272
LIMITED TESTING- CAPACITY THAT

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:30.307
WE HAD BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE PUT

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.242
IN PLACE NOW POLICIES. FOR

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.878
TESTING EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.147
EVERY IN NOT. ILL NURSING

OF CALIFORNIA SO BASELINE

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:45.089
TESTING. IT HAS BEEN- I.

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:47.224
REQUIRED IN THAT AND ALSO THESE

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.859
LETTER WHICH GOES OUT TO-

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.227
LICENSED FACILITIES THAT THEY

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:52.062
WILL BE DOING TESTING NOT ONLY

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.597
OF EVERY RESIDENT BUT ALSO- THE

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.265
HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS WELL AND

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.834
THEN THERE IS A MECHANISM IS

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.702
PUT IN PLACE IF A POSITIVE TEST

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.804
IS FOUND WHAT THE HELL OFTEN

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:04.008
REPEATING- TEST WILL NEED TO BE

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.409
DONE. AND IF I'M- IF NO CASES

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.044
ARE FOUND. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.613
TO CONTINUE. TESTING SUBSETS OF

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.316
THOSE EMPLOYEES. TO MAKE SURE

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.617
THAT THERE ARE NO NEW CASES

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.919

RIGHT NOW WE'RE MOVING

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.489
AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH THIS AND

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:19.323
WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.324
TESTING IS ESSENTIAL IN THOSE

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.392
ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.960
WE'RE READ DIRECTING A LOT OF

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.194
OUR TESTING RESOURCES RIGHT

THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:38.802
CONTROL ABOUT. THEIR LEVEL OF

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.404
RISK- EVERY DAY WHEN THEY AKE

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.106

IT'S ALSO BEEN CREATED IN A

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:50.280
WAY. THAT WOULD HELP REDUCE THE

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:52.616

INTEGRATING THE DATA AND

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.531
THINKING. ABOUT A FIRST AS WE

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:28.865
ROLLED OUT OR AS WE DESCRIBED

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:31.068
IN OUR PANDEMIC ROAD MAP. THAT

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.036
THE DIFFERENT STAGES THAT FIRST

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.538
PHASE IS THE FIRST LOOK AT

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:36.907
LOWER RISK- WORK ENVIRONMENT

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.175
DOES WORK ENVIRONMENTS THAT

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:41.078
WITH MODIFICATION- COULD OPEN

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.079
EARLIER AND THEN WE'VE BEEN

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.581
BUILDING OUT TO THOSE THAT MAY

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:47.184
BE- MORE RISKY MORE RISKY

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.986
BECAUSE THEY RE IN. SALT IF.

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.823
POPULATION AND SO AGAIN THAT

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:54.858
INFORMATION IS BEING USED AND

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.893
SYNTHESIZED OUT TO MAKE THOSE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.795
DECISIONS USING THE BEST

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:01.331
EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.433
KEEPING CALIFORNIANS HEALTHY

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.035
GREAT THANK YOU FINAL. I WANT

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.036

THE TIME YOU USE USE THAT SPENT

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:09.906
WITH US TODAY I DO WANT TO

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:12.242
SHOOT A FINAL QUESTION- CENTER

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:13.910
BASE TO TALK EARLY ON ABOUT YOU

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:15.712
KNOW A VACCINE AND NOT ME I.

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:16.880
WORK HEARING ALL THESE TIME

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:19.282
LINES AND THEY SEEM VERY-

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.917
AMBITIOUS TO ME BUT DO YOU

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.152
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.787
WORKING VACCINE IN PLACE BEFORE

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.822
WE CAN COMPLETELY OPEN UP

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:28.191
CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I THINK.

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.060
PART OF THIS IS THAT WE MUST

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.796
HAVE TREATMENT AND THERAPY AT A

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:35.866
MINIMUM TO BE ABLE TO- TO BE

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:37.901
ABLE TO. EAT AT. I MEAN STEP

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.703
WISE PROCESS RIGHT SO. SO AT

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.304
THIS TIME THE TREATMENTS THAT

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:42.973
WE HAVE REALLY ARE. VERY

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:45.375
LIMITED. AND THEY ARE FOCUSED

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.277
ON WHEN PEOPLE ARE VERY SICK.

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.612
SO AS MORE TREATMENTS

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:50.013
POTENTIALLY BECOME AVAILABLE

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.349
THAT MIGHT BE YEARS EARLIER-

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.350
MIGHT EVEN BE USED FOR A

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:54.818
SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE THERE MIGHT

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:55.685
BE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.220
THINK ABOUT HOW MEDICAL

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.121
TREATMENTS. A MEDICAL

00:50:58.188 --> 00:50:59.456
INTERVENTIONS BE THE VACCINE

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:03.059
OR- TREATMENTS. MAY PROVIDE US

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:08.031
THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO. TO OPEN

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.032
UP OR MAKE DECISIONS A LITTLE

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.435
DIFFERENTLY. WE CAN'T. WHEN IT

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.637
HAPPENED- BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.105
CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT

SITTING HERE FOR A WHILE I

MAKE ONE ONE COMMENT YOU KNOW

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.764
THERE'S CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.166
ECONOMY AND OUR SOCIETY. THAT

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:19.569
DON'T. TURN ON WITH A LIGHT

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.138
SWITCH THEN I REALIZE IT'S

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:23.874
DIFFICULT TO PLAN WITH THIS

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.243
COVERT NINETEEN. BUT IN THE

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.011
FUTURE WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.312

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:31.748

PROVIDE TARGET DATES FOR RE

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:49.533
VALUABLE. IN TERMS OF

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.735

TO ME THAT ARE MEMBERS OF MY

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:38.441

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.210
OF CODE NINETEEN WILL OF COURSE

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:43.580
I AM I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA SO

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:46.282
I HAD MY HI HEALTH STAFF

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.184
CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.686
PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN FACT THEY

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:55.158
EVIDENCE- IT I BELIEVE AND GO

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:57.027
INTO THE DATA AND THE ARE THE

00:54:57.093 --> 00:55:00.130
EXPERTS. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:03.566
THAT- NOT KEEPING THE DATA AS

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:06.836
IT RELATES TO LGBT Q. NON

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:09.139
BINARY- INDIVIDUALS ALTHOUGH I

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:11.708
RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY- AS

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:14.244
YOU ARE IN CAN BRING SOMETHING

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:15.679
THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE A

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:18.615
PANDEMIC THAT BECAME VERY. OUR

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:20.784
EVIDENT VERY QUICKLY THAT WE

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.819
OBVIOUSLY HAD A REAL PROBLEM.

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:25.155
BUT ARE SO HOW YOU'RE PREPARED

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:28.491
TO COLLECT DATA AND DO THAT BUT-

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.560
YOU KNOW FROM HISTORY ARE THOSE

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:33.630
FROM OUR MARGINALIZE MINORITY

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.465
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.334
GENDER. HISTORICALLY WOMEN.

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.070
HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE DATA

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:42.405
AND THE STUDIES AND THE NUMBER

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.040
SO IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO.

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:45.875
DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.410
SO I JUST KIND OF WOULD LIKE

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:50.480
YOU TO RESPOND TO THE- ISSUE OF

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:54.451
LGBT Q. OUR DATA RELATED TO THE

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:57.053
NUMBERS OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.524
ALSO AT MOVING FORWARD I HAD A

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.226
WE INTEND TO. ADDRESS THAT

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:05.228
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR OUR

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:09.699
COMMUNITIES. YEAH A LOOK AT- WE

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.668
WON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:12.669
TO HEALTH INEQUITIES OF WE'RE

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:13.870
NOT MEASURING THEM WE WON'T

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.405
FIND THEM SO WHAT WE DON'T

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.140
COLLECT IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.975
WE DO COLLECT. AND WHEN WE SEE

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.944

THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE SO

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.491

KIND OF. PUT THAT IN PRACTICE

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.987
GOING FORWARD. WITHOUT HAVING

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:48.224
TO DO A. PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.692

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.261

CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIANS SO

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:20.056
THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M MORE.

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.424
LET THE SENATOR BATES HAS ONE

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:22.725
MORE COMMENT OR QUESTION DOCTOR

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.494
ANGEL SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.429
HER FOLLOWED BY A DURING THE

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:27.964
QUESTIONING- FROM ALL OF THE

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:30.066
GOOD VICE CHAIR. REGARDING THE

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.601
DATA AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:34.237
IMPORTANT QUESTION REGARDING

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:34.871
THE DATA THAT'S USED FOR

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:36.506
OPENING UP. A VERY A FIVE

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.707
FACILITIES AND NOW I

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:39.509
ENTERTAINMENTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:41.577
THERE WAS A BIG A PROBLEM IN

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.946
ORANGE COUNTY WHEN OUR BEACHES

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:44.547
WHERE IT OPENED AND YET LOS

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:46.783
ANGELES COUNTY'S BEACHES WERE.

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.284
THEY HAD A HIGHER- DEATH RATE

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.119
THEY HAD A HIGHER AYE INFECTION

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:52.288
RATE A HIGHER- HOSPITALIZATION

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:54.457
RATE. SO THE CONSTITUENTS GET

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.859
UPSET WHEN THERE IS KIND OF A

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:59.829
COOKIE CUTTER APROACH. TO AND

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.998
IF YOU CAN OPEN AND NOT OPEN

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.100
AND THE E. R. COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:07.070
NOT ON. THOSE HIGH NUMBERS HAVE

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.272
BEEN YOU KNOW VERY DIFFERENT

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:11.975
DISENGAGE AND ARE SUPPORTING.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.843
OUR HEALTH WORKERS SO ARE YOU

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.144
IS THE BEACH EGGS HOLD BECAUSE

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.313
THERE WAS NO REASON THAT ORANGE

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.614
COUNTY'S BEACHES COULDN'T

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.917
OPENED AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:21.384
STILL QUESTIONABLE BY.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.252
COMMUNITY THAT HAD HIGHER RATE

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.388
FOR OPENED IN A WE WERE NOT

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.357
ALLOWED TO. SO I GET FIFTH

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.925
MAYBE NOT A QUESTION CIVIC

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:34.831
DURING BILL BUT. NO REQUIRE

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.132
GOING FORWARD. YEAH THERE IS

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.400
MORE OF A- INDEPENDENT VIEW OF

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:40.103
THE DAY **** FROM A COULD. SO

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.704
THOSE WHO ARE AND I KNOW ACT.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.272
IS DEALING WITH SOME ABOUT

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.507
PRESENTLY BECAUSE I'VE READ

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.542
MOST OF THOSE REPORTS BUT I

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.777
THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT FOR

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.545
THE COMMUNICATION TO COME OUT

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.481
ABOUT YOU WILL BE LOOKING MORE

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:54.917
AT OUT THOSE SPECIFIC. DATA IN

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.285
REACHING THOSE DATA POINTS

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.854
BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN AND I THINK

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.988
THAT'S GOING TO GIVE SOME

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.757
CONFIDENCE A TO COMMUNITIES AND

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.291
IN PARTICULAR BUSINESSES

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.327
BECAUSE BUSINESSES FOLLOWING

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.829
THE GUIDANCE OF FAIR THEY

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:08.398
SHOULD NOT IN ANY WAY. BE HELD

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.800
BACK NOT NOT TO OPEN JUST

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.468
BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITY AROUND

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.137
THEM IS NOT OPENING AND I THINK

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.705
THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.306
TERMS OF THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:19.308
GETTING CONSUMERS BACK A TO OUR

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.577
BUSINESS SAW MARKETPLACE IN

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.212
ENSURING THAT THE BE ALL

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.014
COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL WHO THE

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:27.083
CONSUMER SPECIFICALLY. ARE

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.418
ABIDING BY THE RULES

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:29.619
REGULATIONS THAT THAT

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.587
BUSINESSES HAVE TO PUT OUT

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:32.522
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.490
THIS DISENCHANTMENT IS

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.325
HAPPENING THAT THERE SEEMS TO

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:37.627
BE A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.429
COMING OUT OF THE STATE AND

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.463
THEN EACH. MONEY HEALTH

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.131
DEPARTMENT IS EITHER GOING TO

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.866
ABIDE BY THOSE STRICTLY BECAUSE

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:44.667
THEY'RE AFRAID OF SOME

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.502
LIABILITY WHEN YOU'RE TELLING

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:49.305
US THAT THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.239
FORTY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.275
SO I THINK THE COMMUNICATION

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.276
BEEN POOR AND I'M GOING OUT THE

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.278
COMMITTEE I SERVE ON. I WILL BE

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.380
BRINGING OUT UP THAT THERE HAS

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.848
TO BE SOME STANDARDS IF THE

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.616
COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER HAS THE

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.285
RESPONSIBILITY THEN THEY SHOULD

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.220
BE BACKED UP BY A STATE THAT

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.522
THEY CAN USE THAT DATA AND NOT-

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.558
THAT COMES IN A GUIDANCE AS TO

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:10.526
GENERAL WERE TOO RESTRICTIVE.

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.829
IN TERMS OF WHETHER THAT

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.098
PARTICULAR AREA OPEN NOT OPEN

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:20.369
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US FEET

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.105
OF. LEGISLATORS AND ANSWER ANY

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.507
THE PRESENT SORRY FOR THE TRY

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.508
TO EXPLAIN THAT I CAN'T YOU HOW.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.576
MANY CALLS AND HAND THEY CAME

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:28.177
AND THE ANGER WAS THERE IN

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.846
ORANGE COUNTY. JUST BECAUSE THE

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.814
PICTURE WAS SHOWN REGARDING

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.749
WHAT WAS ON THE BEACH AT THAT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.818
TIME I THINK WAS IN APRIL. IN

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:36.919
THE PICTURE WAS TOTALLY

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.221
DISTORTED BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.256
WAS TAKEN. AND THAT WAS USE

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.858
RATHER THAN DATA THAT WAS USED

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.626
TO CLOSE THE BEACHES. SO IT'S

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:46.696
JUST A SOMETHING THAT I ANT.

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:49.031

VERY ARE AWARE OF. BECAUSE WE

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.403
CAN GET PEOPLE O DO WHAT

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.104
