00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.715
THE HISTORY. IN FACT THE VERY

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.316
HISTORY OF THIS STATE IS

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:40.453
INTERLINKED. WITH ASIANS YOU

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:45.691
CAME TO CALIFORNIA. TO FOSTER%

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.560
AND ACHIEVE THE MODERN

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:50.630
MONUMENTAL. INTERCONTINENTAL

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:54.467
RAILROAD. THOSE CHINESE

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:58.571
INDIVIDUALS. BUT THEIR LIVES AT

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:01.908
RISK. THE CROSS THE SIERRAS. AND

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:10.316
BRING AMERICA TO THE WEST COAST. SO THIS BILL HAD SIMPLY

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:18.658
RECOMMENDS WITH CERTAIN CRITERIA. IMMERSION OR EXPOSURE TO IF

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:22.595
YOU WILL. STILL NOT A MANDATE IN

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:26.732
K. TWELVE. ELEMENTS ABOUT THE

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:30.303
ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.637
. AND I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH JUST

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:35.775
A MOMENT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.310
. DURING WORLD WAR TWO THE

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:41.414
ATTORNEY WAS A GREAT. DATE TWO

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.218
OF AMERICA. ALL WOULD CONCLUDE

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.787
AFTER THAT THAT WAS A MAJOR

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:53.626
MISTAKE. I GOT TO SEE SOME OF

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.127
THAT UP FRONT AND PERSONAL. SO

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:59.198
OUR NEIGHBORS WERE JAPANESE.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:05.838
BOMBERS AND THEY WERE ENTERED.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:10.309
MY DAD WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY- IN

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.912
OUR CASE WE ASSURED MANY E. THAT

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.247
WE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HIS LAND.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:18.551
MAINTAINERS EQUIPMENT. WHEN THEY

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.953
CAME HOME. IT WOULD BE THERE FOR

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.590
HIM. I REMEMBER MY DAD SOME OF

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.659
THE ME ONE DAY AND SAY AND TAKE

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:29.428
THE TRACTOR. OVER TO BENNY. HE'S

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:34.734
BACK. AND HE NEEDS. WE WERE BUT

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.936
A SMALL EXAMPLE NOT EVEN THE

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:41.874
GREATEST EXAMPLE. OF MAKING LIFE

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.476
THE WRONG INFLICTED ON OUR

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:48.147
NEIGHBORS. SOON TURNED. SO THAT

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.982
WOULD BE MORE OF THE NEGATIVE

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.117
SIDE OF THE HISTORY THAT THE

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:56.222

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.896
SIMPLY ADDS IN- WHEN IT TALKS

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.332

OTHER PEOPLE AND- EVEN SOMETHING

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.690
AS SIMPLE AS ADDING AN API-

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:43.027
CONTRIBUTORS TO SOCIETY FIXES A

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.128
LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.130

THAT'S GOING THROUGH IN HIGH

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.571
SCHOOL- THAT WILL AT SOME POINT

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:55.072
MANDATE EDUCATION AT THE HIGH

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.441
SCHOOL LEVEL AND WE ARE ASKING

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:59.677
FOR THAT MECHANISM EXISTS IN

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.712
CALIFORNIA DID A GREAT JOB. THIS

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:05.750
IS SAYING- HEY SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:07.985
AS A BOARD AS A LEGISLATOR IT

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:10.054
SAYS THIS IS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.390
OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE IT

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.291
IS IN THAT SENSE AND MANDATE

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.627
SAYING THIS LEGISLATOR SAYS THIS

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:20.064
IS A HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE SO THAT

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.332
IS SOMETHING THAT GOES OUT TO

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.367
EVERY SCHOOL BOARD IN EVERY

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.403
SCHOOL DISTRICT SO IT HAS THAT

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:28.572
POWER WITH IT WE DON'T NEED NEW

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.042
CURRICULUM TO BE DEVELOPED AS

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:33.577
HENRY CHANG MENTIONED- THERE'S

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:35.212
ALREADY A LOT OF RESOURCES

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:38.516

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:39.984

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:46.190
THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE PUT IN TO

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:47.658
ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.660

WE HAVE BEEN AS A STATE

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:55.659

IN TESTIMONY. TO THE ASIAN

00:39:58.095 --> 00:40:00.898
PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:04.802
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.505
INTERNET. BUT NONE THE LESS A

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:10.374
PLUS. AND THAT WAS WHAT I CALL

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.009
MORAL SUASION. AND THESE

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.778

TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.782
ORGANIZATIONS A TREMENDOUS

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:20.017
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.585
BE VOICING THEIR OPINIONS. THE

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:25.422
LOCAL PEOPLE. WHATEVER THE CHORE

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:27.324
OF THE LEGISLATURE SAYING WITH

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:29.660
THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THESE

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:32.930
ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT THEY THEN

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:35.633
DISTRICT BY DISTRICT BOARD BY

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:38.202

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:45.643
OF MEMBERS. AND IN EDUCATION AS

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:48.245
WELL AS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:50.981
SOME APPREHENSION ABOUT MANDATE

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.150
. IT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE.

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:54.652
UNFUNDED MANDATES IN THIS

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.554
LEGISLATURE HAS UNFUNDED

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.322
MANDATES FOR EVER. AND WE'RE

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:02.326
STILL GOING. I THINK THAT IS A

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:05.996
NEGATIVE. THE SOCIETY THIS

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:09.233
SUASION CARRIAGE PURCHASE AND IT

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.068
CARRIES PURCHASE BECAUSE I THINK

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.503
JUST LIKE THE ASIAN PACIFIC

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.873
ISLANDER COMMUNITY I THINK MOST

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.375
CALIFORNIANS CARE. THEY ARE

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:21.011

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.693
THAT THERE'S CURRICULA OUT THERE

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.094

ACTED OUT SPEAKS TO THE

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.599
CHALLENGE RIGHT- THAT- THE FACT

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:44.134
THAT YOU HAVE A LIST OF AMERICAN

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.436
HEROES AND NONE ARE ASIAN

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.471
AMERICAN WE KNOW THERE'S MANY

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.307
OUT THERE- I WOUL ALSO HOWEVER

PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.683
ACTUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.019
BILL BECAUSE- IT- DOESN'T

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:02.753
ACTUALLY SEEM TO MOVE THE

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.055
NEEDLE. AND I WOULD JUST POINT

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.458
OUT SO I THINK FOR MANY MEMBERS

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.559
ON THE COMMITTEE WHO. WHETHER

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.694
IT'S YOUR GENDER OR YOUR RACE OR

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:13.964
SO FORTH- IT'S GREAT TO HAVE

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:16.867
MORAL SUASION BUT- OFTENTIMES IT

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.035
DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY MOVE THE

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:21.572
NEEDLE VERY MUCH. BY ITSELF. AND

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.808
SO- AND- THANK- IN FACT THERE

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.443
WAS REFERENCE MADE IN THE

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.579
TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SOME OF

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.314
THE LAWS IN THE OTHER STATES.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.950
THOSE LAWS ACTUALLY MANDATED.

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:36.587
TEACHING OF API I HISTORY IN THE

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:37.821
CURRICULUM THEY DIDN'T SIMPLY

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.723
SAY SUGGEST THEY MANDATED IT

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.759
BECAUSE I KNEW A SUGGESTION WAS

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.694
NOT ENOUGH. AND I WOULD POINT

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.195
OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE PASSED AND

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:46.931
WITH THE L. A. P. I. CARCASS WAS

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.699
PART OF THE SUPPORT FOR- THE

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.668
REQUIREMENT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES.

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.703
WHY DID WE PASS A REQUIREMENT

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.673
FOR GRADUATION EPIC STUDIES. AND

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:59.276
TELL IT AND IT WAS BECAUSE- IT

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.011
WASN'T HAPPENING IN FACT WE HAD

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.012
THIS DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.647
REQUIRED FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AND

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.482
YOU KNOW AND I HAVE MY OWN YOU

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:07.451
KNOW ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOW IT

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.386
IMPLEMENTS BUT IN THE END. IN

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.120
ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:12.723
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW DECADES

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:16.393
LATER- NOTHING HAPPENED. SO- YOU

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.495
KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:19.530
BEEN SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.799
PAPA ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:24.568
BILL IS NOT READY DATA WE NEED

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:27.404
TO DO MORE WORK- TO MAKE IT MORE

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.673
SENSITIVE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.408
THAT THIS BILLS COMING BEFORE US

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:35.746
IN THIS CURRENT FORM AND- SO-

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.281
YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THAT

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.649
UNFORTUNATE I'M NOT ABLE TO

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:41.719
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BECAUSE-

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:44.555
WE THINK THAT OUR COMMUNITY THE

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:47.024
API COMMUNITY. DESERVE SOMETHING

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:49.593
MORE SUBSTANTIVE. THAT WE DON'T

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.462
WANT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.664
BOMBING ALREADY THAT CAN SAID BY

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.599
THE WAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:56.200
JUST GONNA SUGGEST THINGS FOR

00:43:56.266 --> 00:43:58.602
YOU IT'S TIME FOR REAL ACTION

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.471
THE API HATE IS REAL. THE

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.573
SUFFERING A COMMITTEE IT IS REAL

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:05.542
AND IT'S HAPPENING NOW SO- IT'S

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:06.744
IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE FIRMER

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.013
STEPS. TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.515
THE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:12.816
THE PROPER ON THESE ISSUES. BUT

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.585
ARE FRUSTRATED THAT THERE HASN'T

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.553
BEEN A BROADER DIALOGUE ABOUT

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.689
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WE SHOULD

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.557
FOLLOW THE LEAD TO SOME THE

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:21.492
OTHER STATES THAT ACTUALLY

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:23.127
MANDATE CURRICULA. THERE'S OTHER

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.661
STATES THAT WERE MENTIONED IN

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:27.031
THE TESTIMONY SO- AGAIN CENTER

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:28.665
RESIN I APPRECIATE YOUR PAST

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:30.667
LEADERSHIP AND THE SUPPORT FOR

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.836
THE API COMMUNITY- BUT AND I

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:33.604
THINK WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.641
ABOUT THIS BEFORE. THIS BUT WE

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.376
COULDN'T. JUST DOING SOMETHING

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:42.713
IS. THE THAT IS A SUGGESTION I

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.416
THINK IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.683
COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. UNDER THE

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.385
PLAN WITH YOU PROPOSED AN

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.521
AMENDMENT WHICH I WOULD ACCEPT

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.890
MANDATING IT. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:55.325
SUGGEST IS THAT WE ACTUALLY AND

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.828
I THINK- THE- POINT OUT IS THAT

00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:00.464
WE NEED TO DO WORKS TO ON ITS

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.634
AGAIN TO. SAY THAT IT'S THAT

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.402
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.471
WHAT IS AND AGAIN I WISH THAT

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.873
THE THAT THE- SPONSORS THE BILL

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.076

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.952
IN OUR STATE AND OUR LOCAL

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.287
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WOULD

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.555
ACTUALLY NEED TO TAKE ACTION SO

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.323
WE COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC. AND

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.192
HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. RIGHT HAVE

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:31.628
ACCOUNTABILITY- FOR THE THINGS

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:33.530
THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO BE SURE

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:35.899
THAT- ALL THE CHILDREN AND I

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.101
HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL TO IN

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.502
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT THE

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.538
CHILDREN- ACTUALLY. WILL

COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.348
AND- SO WE COULD BUILD ON ETHNIC

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:52.850
STUDIES REQUIREMENT THERE'S A

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:55.652
LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO BUT I

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:56.854
MEAN THIS BILL IS FAIRLY SILENT

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.821
ABOUT ALL THAT. IT DOESN'T TALK

00:45:57.888 --> 00:46:00.190
ABOUT MECHANISMS RIGHT IT SAYS.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.493
IT'S AN EFFORT THAT'S MADE TO

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:03.060
THE IMPRIMATUR RIGHT OF THE

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:04.695
LEGISLATURE JUST DOING A BILL

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:07.064
AND SAY I LIKE THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:07.698
PASSED THE BILL. BUT THERE'S NO

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.866
REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NO TALKING

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:09.900
ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES ARE WHO

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.535
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SCHOOL

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.769
BOARDS THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:13.737
RESPONSIBLE IN SOME WAY

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.973
FURTHERING THE IMPLEMENTATION.

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:17.975
SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE HAD

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:19.710
SUGGESTED THAT- THERE'D BE MORE

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:24.615

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.984
AFTER YOU KNOW THE- A TICKET TO

UNFORTUNATE WORK HAS NOT BEEN

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.160

00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:37.628
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. SPEAKING OF

A AS AN ITALIAN AMERICAN IT'S

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.480
EVEN WORSE BECAUSE TELOMERIC INS

LIKE THAT BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.769
THERE WAS A BILL IT SIMPLY SAID.

00:48:58.835 --> 00:48:59.436
OF THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:02.606
LEGISLATURE. DECLARES THAT IT'S

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:06.209

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:28.332
THAT'S A SUGGESTION. BUT IT'S

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:29.166
ALSO STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:31.935
INTENT AND I DO THINK. THERE'S A

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.970
LONG HISTORY. A SHORT AS I'VE

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.705
THE IDEA THAT LEGISLATION COULD

ANOTHER SYMBOL. WHILE

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.459
LEGISLATION CAN BEGIN TO DEFINE

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.147
TOUGH DECISIONS. AND THE

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:58.526
HAVE VERY. A DIVERSE AMOUNT OF

01:34:58.592 --> 01:34:59.527
NATIVE AMERICANS WHO WERE

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:01.729
WRONGED. I WASN'T THERE WHEN

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.464
THEY WERE WRONG BUT THEY WERE

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.066
WRONG IN THEIR HISTORY- IT. IS

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.901
REALLY SAD FOR OUR STATE AND FOR

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.903
OUR NATION BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.037
DECISIONS THAT ARE GOING TO GO

01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:11.972
INTO THE FUTURE ON THINGS THAT

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.474
HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND MANY

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.042
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED OVER THESE

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:17.645
LONG PERIODS OF TIME. AND SO

01:35:17.711 --> 01:35:19.613
THERE'S A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.782
THERE'S A LOT MOVING IN THIS

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.317
AREA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

TODAY ON A LAYOFF THE BILL

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:30.791
BECAUSE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO

BE QUITE FRANKLY A LOT MORE

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.494

INFORMATION BROUGHT FORWARD BUT

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.330
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.631
THE PROCESS. THAT WE'RE GOING

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:38.699
THROUGH IS UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.134

01:35:56.951 --> 01:35:57.651
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED.

01:35:57.718 --> 01:36:00.020
LITERALLY OVER A HUNDRED AND

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:02.156
FORTY YEARS AGO AND WE WERE IN

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:04.125
THERE AND THE FACTS NEED TO BE.

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:06.660

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:33.380
ARE. BOTH THE YOU KEEP PEOPLE.

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.048
THE PEOPLE OF AROUND L. INDIAN

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:35.883
TRIBES. THEY WERE MASSACRED

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:39.520
LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS-

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:42.323
GENOCIDE. AND WE SIT HERE EVERY

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.157
NIGHT LOOKING AT WHAT'S

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.291
HAPPENING UKRAINE AND THERE'S

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:46.560
GENOCIDE HAPPENING THERE AND

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:47.795
THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE. I

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:50.030
HAVE BEEN HERE STATE AND WAS.

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:51.932
OUR GOVERNMENT THAT DID IT. SO

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.133
NOW WE'RE CENTURY LATER WE'RE

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.237
GONNA SAY IT WASN'T HIM BUT IT

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.504
WAS ACTUALLY THE STATE THAT

01:37:57.571 --> 01:38:00.241
ALLOWED. I'M SORRY I JUST CANNOT

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:02.710
BELIEVE THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:05.980
COME UP AND SUPPORT THAT. VIEW

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:08.649
KANDYANS WERE MASSACRED. AND I

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.884
AGREE THAT THE HASTINGS NAME

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:12.086
SHOULD FOREVER BE STRIPPED FROM

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.587
THE BUILDING. SCOURGE ON OUR

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:16.890
HISTORY. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:18.459
THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.928
FIRST. ARE IN THE PEOPLE OF THE

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:23.464
ROUND ALLEY INDIAN TRIBES IN THE

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:24.598
U. K. PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER FROM

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:27.568
THE STATE. SO DO ALL THE OTHER

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:28.769
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.738
CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WEST.

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:31.972
THE ONLY WAY THAT WE COME TO

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:33.741
TERMSTHE ONLY WAY THAT WE COME

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:35.576
TO TERMS WITH THE ATROCITIES OF

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.177
THE PAST IS BY SHAPING A

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:38.545
BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THE NATIVE

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.014
PEOPLE IN THE STATE IN THE

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.782
FUTURE. THERE IS A REASON WHY

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:45.552
NATIVE CHILDREN HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.554
ACES SCORES IN THE STATE. WHY

01:38:47.621 --> 01:38:48.889
SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.624
RATES IN THE STATE PER CAPITA

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.793
EXIST ON NATIVE AMERICAN

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.195
RESERVATIONS. WHY THERE IS MORE

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.630
FIT NO USE IN DRUG USE AND

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:59.466
ALCOHOL USE WITHIN THE TRIBES OF

01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:01.468
CALIFORNIANS COMMUNITY IT IS

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.937
BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IS

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:05.773
HAPPENING TO THIS PAST IN THE

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:09.176
PAST. WITH THESE PEOPLE. SO

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:09.810
HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE IN THIS

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:12.780
LEGISLATION. I COMPLETELY AGREE

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.448
WITH WHERE CENTER AMBERG IN

01:39:14.515 --> 01:39:16.083
CENTER WIENER AND A MAJORITY

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.751

TO GO ON THIS AND I SUPPORT IT.

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:21.855
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LOSE

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.524
SIGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WE

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:24.858
NEED TO FOCUS IN ON. THIS IS

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.794
MUCH MORE THAN A NAME CHANGE.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.595
THIS IS ABOUT LIFTING UP THE

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:29.697
PEOPLE OF AROUND ALLEY INDIAN

01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:31.632
TRIBES IN THE U. K. PEOPLE. THIS

01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:33.167
LEGISLATION MUST BE SPECIFIC

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:34.601
ABOUT THE PROGRAMS SERVICES AND

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.337

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.539
PROVIDE. FOR THOSE NATIVE

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:42.409
RESIDENTS. I'M SORRY- MANAGER I

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.511
DON'T USUALLY GET HOT AROUND THE

THAT ARE INVOLVED. AND SO WE'VE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.067
BEEN HAVING SOME GOOD

SO I THINK THAT ARE UP MARK ARE

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:54.615
OPPOSITION AS THE TRIBAL

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:56.450
COUNCIL. TO THE BILL WAS THAT

01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:57.918
THAT WASN'T INCLUDED. BUT THEN

01:40:57.985 --> 01:40:59.453
WE JUST HEAR THESE GENTLEMEN

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.156
OF DISCUSSIONS- AT THE FIRST

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.691
BILL THAT I INTRODUCED IN THE

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.459
LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:53.760
FIFTEEN. WAS A BILL TO REMOVE

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.562
THE NAME OF CONFEDERATE LEADERS

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:57.230
FROM OUR PUBLIC BUILDINGS HERE

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:59.633
IN CALIFORNIA- FOR THE SAME

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.034
REASONS THAT I THINK THIS.

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:03.236
DEBATE AND DISCUSSIONS ARE. ARE

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:05.973
CONTINUING BECAUSE THE- YOU KNOW

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.608
WE WANT THERE TO BE

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:10.210
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PEOPLE. AND

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:14.047
WE WANT- NAMES TO REFLECT PLACES

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:16.617
OF HONOR. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:44:16.683 --> 01:44:17.851
WHAT THE AUTHORS ARE TRYING TO

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:22.122
ADVANCE WITH THIS BILL I AM. AND

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:24.157
THEN BY THE WAY BECAUSE IT WAS

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:24.658
REFERENCE TO THE STATE

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:26.059
SANCTIONING OF THIS TYPE OF

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:27.427
ACTIVITY ABSOLUTE THEY'RE

01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:31.598
ABSOLUTELY WHAT'S- AND- OUR

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:34.735
FIRST GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BURNETT

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.637
- MADE STATEMENTS AND WAS

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.138
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AN

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:39.406
EXTERMINATION ACTIVITIES IN OUR

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:42.909
STATE. FIRST GOVERNOR AND- IF

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:45.212
YOU GO TO THE CAPITOL TODAY. YOU

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:46.880
WILL SEE HIS PORTRAIT IN A PLACE

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:49.516
OF HONOR. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:52.085
ENCOURAGE- A REVIEW OF THAT-

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:55.822
SITUATION. I HAD MINIMUM- BUT I

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.290
AT MATTERS LIKE THIS I DEFER TO

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:59.326
THE COLLEGE I THINK THEY'VE GOT

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.795
ENGAGED IN A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS.

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.630
TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT THE

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.999
HISTORY AND ALL OF THAT I THINK

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:07.501
THAT THE BILL TODAY DOESN'T

01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:08.869
SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WOULD

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.604
CERTAINLY ELIMINATE SOMETHING

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:11.838
THAT I THINK IS CLEARLY- IT

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:13.674
NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I'M HAPPY

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.308
TO SUPPORT IT I THINK THIS

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.476
ACCOUNTABILITY IS A HEALTHY

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:17.711
THING IT TAKES A LOT OF

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:20.447
COMMITTEE TIME AND ALL THE REST

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:21.615

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:25.452
LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIFE THAT- THAT

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.487
YOUR HISTORY WILL BE REVIEWED

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:30.257

TODAY I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:52.163
STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL.

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:54.098
DESPITE THE GREAT VALUES AND

02:22:54.165 --> 02:22:57.068
GOALS BECAUSE- IT SEEMS TO OPEN

02:22:57.135 --> 02:23:01.005
A PANDORA'S- AND I'LL TO GIVE

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:03.007
THE IDEA THEY WANT AUTHOR IT'S

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:05.410
TO MAKE ADDRESS. SOME OF CAN-

02:23:05.476 --> 02:23:07.712
FOR- WE CAN'T REGULATE SPEECH.

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:09.480
AND SO STUDENTS WHO DECIDE TO

02:23:09.547 --> 02:23:12.417
LEAVE SCHOOL FOR- THE PURPOSE

02:23:12.483 --> 02:23:14.752
OF- ENGAGING AND- THIS KEPT THE

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:17.121
CIVIC ACTIVITY COULD DO IT FOR

02:23:17.188 --> 02:23:17.689
EVEN EXTREMIST GROUPS SOME

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:20.425
GROUPS THAT THAT ADVANCE HATE-

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.493
AND SO THAT CERTAINLY. GIVES US

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.594
SOME PAUSE ALTHOUGH WE

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.563
APPRECIATE THE RIGHTS OF ALL

02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:29.334
PEOPLE TO. EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS.

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.402
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT- WE

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:32.770
SEEM TO BE STRUGGLING TO GET

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.872
STUDENTS TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:38.443
BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE-

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:41.479
STUDIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE-

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:44.582
THE I DON'T RECALL OFF HAND HOW

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:45.950
MANY. SCHOOL DAYS ARE YOU

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:47.752
CURRENTLY REQUIRED TODAY AND HOW

02:23:47.819 --> 02:23:49.754
THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. I

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:51.022
KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL WORRIED

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:52.056
ABOUT LEARNING LOSSES WE HAVE

02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:53.992
GONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND-

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:55.727
AND WE DO SEE DECLINING TEST

02:23:55.793 --> 02:23:58.029
SCORES. SO WE KNOW THAT THE WORK

02:23:58.096 --> 02:24:00.531
OF OUR- OF OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:04.769
IS- STILL WE STILL HAVE TO DO A

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.771
LOT MORE THAT SPACE AND A PART

02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:08.539
OF THAT IS- STUDENTS BEING IN

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:09.707
THE CLASSROOM TO BE PART OF THAT

02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:11.709
LEARNING PROCESS I WANT TO GIVE

02:24:11.776 --> 02:24:13.478
THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO. ADDRESS

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:15.113
THIS TO WORRIES THEY THINK VERY

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:16.280
MUCH CENTER GLAZER SO ON YOUR

02:24:16.347 --> 02:24:17.782
FIRST QUESTION THAT'S WHAT WE

02:24:17.849 --> 02:24:20.118
STRUGGLE WITH RIGHT IS IF WE

02:24:20.184 --> 02:24:21.386
GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:24.088
ENGAGE IN THEIR CIVIC RIGHTS. WE

02:24:24.155 --> 02:24:26.324
CAN'T I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:29.727
US. DISSUADE OR ELIMINATE THOSE

02:24:29.794 --> 02:24:31.763
WHO ARE. IN MY OPINION LEGEND

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:33.364
LEGITIMATELY PARK PER TO A

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:34.665
PARTICIPATING IN CIVIC

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:37.068
ENGAGEMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A

02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:38.636
MINORITY OF PEOPLE THAT MIGHT

02:24:38.703 --> 02:24:41.139
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:44.509
NEGATIVE. HATE SPEECH TYPE-

02:24:44.575 --> 02:24:46.511
EVENT SO I THINK THAT THE GOOD

02:24:46.577 --> 02:24:48.679
OUTWEIGHS THE BAD- AND I DON'T

02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:49.747
THINK THERE'S ALSO A WAY TO

02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:52.183
LEGISLATE- OF FOR US TO

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:54.852
SUBJECTIVELY SAY. WHAT IS A GOOD

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:56.687
EVENT AND WHAT IS A NOT A NOT A

02:24:56.754 --> 02:24:58.589
GOOD EVENT. I THINK THAT CIVIC

02:24:58.656 --> 02:24:59.624
ENGAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH

02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:01.526
THAT WE TAKE THAT CHANCE

02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:03.961
SECONDLY- YES WE DO ON OUR

02:25:04.028 --> 02:25:05.563
STUDENTS IN CLASS AND WE DO WANT

02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:07.331
THEM LEARNING ALL THE IMPORTANT

02:25:07.398 --> 02:25:08.866
CURRICULUM. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY

02:25:08.933 --> 02:25:10.902
AS A MOTHER OF TWO ADULT

02:25:10.968 --> 02:25:13.204
DAUGHTERS SOME OF THE BEST

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:15.073
THINGS THEY LEARNED WERE DAYS

02:25:15.139 --> 02:25:16.974
WHEN THEY GOT TO PARTICIPATE. IN

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:19.811
AN ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:20.812
THINGS THAT STAYED WITH THEM FOR

02:25:20.878 --> 02:25:22.647
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:26.017
THINGS THAT ENCOURAGE THEM. TO

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.885
TO JUST BE A PART OF OUR SOCIETY

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:29.587
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY VOTED

02:25:29.654 --> 02:25:31.355
ENGAGE CIVICALLY. YOU ALL KNOW

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:32.490
THAT I WAS PART OF THE LABOR

02:25:32.557 --> 02:25:33.925
MOVEMENT AND THEIR MANY TIMES

02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:34.926
WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WERE. THERE

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:37.161
PARTICIPATING IN MANY DIFFERENT

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:38.529
THINGS AND THEIR LIFELONG

02:25:38.596 --> 02:25:40.631
LESSONS SO I THINK THAT THIS ONE

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:42.266
DAY FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

02:25:42.333 --> 02:25:44.202
OUTWEIGHS ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:45.703
CONSTRUED AS A PROBLEM THANK YOU

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.538
THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT AND

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:50.541
AGAIN I SHARE-THE SENTIMENTS

02:25:50.608 --> 02:25:51.809
THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DO ENGAGE

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:53.678
IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IT'S

02:25:53.744 --> 02:25:54.378
REALLY CEMENTS THEIR

02:25:54.445 --> 02:25:56.380
APPRECIATION FOR OUR- WONDERFUL

02:25:56.447 --> 02:25:57.815
. DEMOCRACY IN REPRESENTED

02:25:57.882 --> 02:26:00.852
GOVERNMENT LIKE- SO WE DO HAVE

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:02.887
SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOL. AND I

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.622
KNOW THAT I REMEMBER MIND WHERE

02:26:04.689 --> 02:26:05.857
THEY HAD A SAID YOU NEED TO

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:07.358
ENGAGE IN CERTAIN S. CIVIC

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:09.827
ACTIVITIES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:11.429
THAT THE TEACHER. AND I

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:13.297
CERTAINLY AS A LOCAL ELECTED

02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:14.432
OFFICIAL LITTLE I SEE THAT

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:16.267
STUDENTS COMMAND- TO TEST AT OUR

02:26:16.334 --> 02:26:17.702
CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS TO FOR

02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:18.803
PHYLLIS CIVICS EDUCATION

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:20.538
REQUIREMENT. OF TESTIFYING OR

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:22.540
PARTICIPATING OR WRITING A PAPER

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:24.342
SO WE DO KNOW THAT- OUR OUR

02:26:24.408 --> 02:26:26.477
SCHOOL LEADERS. EMBRACE THAT

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:28.479
GOALS OF THIS BILL IT BUT THEY

02:26:28.546 --> 02:26:31.749
DO IT IN A MORE ORGANIZED

02:26:31.816 --> 02:26:33.084
FASHION AND I GUESS THAT'S THE

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:35.052
THING ME PAUSE ON THE LOWER.

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:36.821
BEFORE US IS THAT. I THINK I'D

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:37.922
PREFER TO DEFERRED THAT LOCAL

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:39.323
LEADERSHIP. ADVANCING THE

02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:40.858
IMPORTANT VALUES THAT YOUR BILL

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:42.927
EXPOSITOR APPRECIATE YOU BRING

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:44.228
IT FORWARD ABSOLUTELY AND I

02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:45.863
THINK THAT IS. THAT IS AGAIN A

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.632
CONUNDRUM BECAUSE NOT EVERY

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.500
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND NOT EVERY

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:51.636
SCHOOL HAS A ROBUST CIVICS

02:26:51.702 --> 02:26:53.771
CLASS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY

02:26:53.838 --> 02:26:55.640
DAUGHTERS DID NOT GET A ROBUST

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:58.009
CIVICS CLASS WHEN THEY WERE IN

02:26:58.075 --> 02:27:00.478
HIGH SCHOOL SO THIS IS A WAY OF

02:27:00.545 --> 02:27:01.512
MAKING SURE. STUDENTS ACROSS THE

02:27:01.579 --> 02:27:04.615
STATE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO SOME

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:06.083
OF THESE- CIVIC ENGAGEMENT

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:08.519
OPPORTUNITIES- I WOULD LOVE

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:10.421
NOTHING MORE THAN TO MAKE SURE

02:27:10.488 --> 02:27:11.055
THAT EVERY SINGLE. HIGH SCHOOL

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:14.525
CLASSROOM- HAS A ROBUST CIVICS

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:16.561
CLASS BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET SO

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.629
THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN THE

02:27:18.696 --> 02:27:22.767
RIGHT DIRECTION. IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:27:22.833 --> 02:27:25.136
OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

02:27:25.203 --> 02:27:27.605

AND OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS- I

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:35.513
THINK AS AS SENATOR GLAZERS SURE

02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:37.582
I ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH

02:27:37.648 --> 02:27:42.053
THE BELL- IN THAT ONE. I

02:27:42.119 --> 02:27:45.523
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE- OUR

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:47.425
CLASSES ARE GOVERNMENT CLASSES

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:49.560
THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT GRADES-

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:51.562

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:15.253
WE HAVE- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:15.753
CURRICULUM. THAT THOSE

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.421
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVERNMENT

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:18.789
ENGAGEMENT TO OBSERVE HOW

02:28:18.856 --> 02:28:20.591
GOVERNMENT WORKS AND WHY IT'S

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:22.526
IMPORTANT TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT

02:28:22.593 --> 02:28:24.495
AND I THINK THE CONCERN THAT I

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:27.531
PERSONALLY HAD WITH THAT IS THAT

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:29.667
ALTHOUGH THE BILL STATES THAT

02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:31.669
IT'S FOR ONE DAY AND OF COURSE I

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:33.537
SHARED. I'M NOT GOING TO ECHO

02:28:33.604 --> 02:28:35.706
THE AB NOT GONNA REPEAT THE THAT

02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:38.409
COMES OVER ME EARLIER BUT IT WAS

02:28:38.476 --> 02:28:40.611
IT THERE IS A- A LINE HERE THAT

02:28:40.678 --> 02:28:42.079
I ACTUALLY WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS

02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:44.682
ABOUT AND THAT WAS WITH REGARDS

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:49.587
TO YOU- LINE. TWENTY THREE THAT

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:50.655
STATES- THE- ALTHOUGH IT'S FOR

02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:52.690
ONE. DAY FOR THE PER OF A HIGH

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:53.791
MIDDLE SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL AND

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:55.159
HIGH SCHOOL PEOPLE ENGAGING IN

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:56.360
CYNICAL CIVIC OR POLITICAL

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:58.496
EVENT. AND THAT RIGHT THERE WAS

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:00.031
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN FOR ME

02:29:00.097 --> 02:29:01.599
THE POLITICAL PART. AS PROVIDED

02:29:01.666 --> 02:29:04.435
IN SUBPARAGRAPH AND THEN IT GOES

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:08.873
ON TO SAY THAT- IS REQUIRED TO

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:11.609
BE EXCUSE FOR ONLY ONE SCHOOL

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:13.544
DAY LONG ABSENCE PER SCHOOL

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:15.846
YEAR. BUT ON THE FOLLOWING LINE

02:29:15.913 --> 02:29:18.282
IT SAYS THE MIDDLES- I'M JUST

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:19.517
GOING TO. SUMMARIZE YOUR BODIES

02:29:19.583 --> 02:29:21.319
AS MAY BE PERMITTED ADDITIONAL

02:29:21.385 --> 02:29:24.522
EXCUSE EXCUSED ABSENCES IN THE

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:26.457
DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:29.126
ADMINISTRATOR- AND NOT ACTUALLY

02:29:29.193 --> 02:29:31.495
TO ME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:32.096
CONCERN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.898
BILL SPECIFIES ONE DAY. IT DOES

02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:35.866
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE FOR A

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:38.336
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND IN THE

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:39.637
FIRST PART OF BILLBOARDS AS A

02:29:39.704 --> 02:29:41.739
POLITICAL EVENT IT MAKES ME A

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:44.442
LITTLE NERVOUS THAT WE WOULD USE

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:47.611
THIS AS A LOOPHOLE. TO HAVE OUR

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:49.313
CHILDREN. BEING GAUGE

02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:51.248
POLITICALLY FOR POLITICAL

02:29:51.315 --> 02:29:54.652
CAMPAIGNS FOR LONG PERIODS OF

02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:56.954
TIME- YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY I

02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.989
MEAN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE OF

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:00.891
THE OF THE OF THE LOCAL. SCHOOL

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:03.561
ADMINISTRATOR AND I THINK FOR ME

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:06.430
OVERALL. ONE THING IS TO BE AB

02:30:06.497 --> 02:30:09.400
THE HOBBIT OPPORTUNITY THROUGH.

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:11.769
THE SCHOOL TO BE ENGAGED IN

02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:13.504
GOVERNMENT AND HOW THE

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:15.506
GOVERNMENT PROCESS WORK IN A

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:16.540
DIFFERENT STORY FOR ME

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:18.442
PERSONALLY IN THE POLITICAL

02:30:18.509 --> 02:30:21.612
CAMPAIGN ARENA. AND THE REASON I

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:23.447
SAY THAT IS THAT I CAME INTO

02:30:23.514 --> 02:30:26.217
THIS SPACE OUT FOR THE VERY

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:28.986
FIRST TIME. AND IT WAS AN EYE

02:30:29.053 --> 02:30:31.789
OPENER AND- IT WAS AN EYE OPENER

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:34.458
BECAUSE I REALIZE HOW TOXIC. OF

02:30:34.525 --> 02:30:36.427
AN ENVIRONMENT IT COULD

02:30:36.494 --> 02:30:39.196
POTENTIALLY BE. AND THERE'S A

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:42.466
LOT OF- THERE'S A LOT OF AB

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:45.136
NEFARIOUS ACTORS IN THE SPACE

02:30:45.202 --> 02:30:46.470
WHERE THEY SHARE A LOT OF FALSE

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:51.675
INFORMATION AND- AND- I'LL JUST

02:30:51.742 --> 02:30:54.278
LEAVE IT AT THAT A LOT OF FALSE

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:55.246
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:55.780
INCREDIBLY MEAN AND VERY

02:30:55.846 --> 02:31:01.018
HURTFUL. AND OUR STUDENTS WHICH-

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:03.521
DON'T HAVE THE LIFE EXPERIENCES

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:05.256
YET TO HELP IN THEIR DEVELOPING

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:06.323
OUT THERE IN THE PROCESS OF

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:08.259
DEVELOPING THAT I'M AFRAID THAT

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:10.461
THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED AND

02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:11.595
THIS IS JUST ME BEING PROTECTED

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:13.664
HERE- BUT EXPOSED TO IT TO A

02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:15.633
SPACE WHERE POTENTIALLY COULD BE

02:31:15.699 --> 02:31:18.569
VERY HARMFUL AND- I THINK

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:19.537
THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE A

02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:22.506
VOTING YOU KNOW AGES OF EIGHTEEN

02:31:22.573 --> 02:31:24.208
OVERCOME THE POLITICAL PART ON

02:31:24.275 --> 02:31:26.210
THAT END AND ONE THING IS BEING

02:31:26.277 --> 02:31:27.478
INVOLVED WITH YOUR PARENTS AND

02:31:27.545 --> 02:31:29.280
SO FORTH AND ANOTHER ONE IS THE

02:31:29.346 --> 02:31:30.815
SCHOOL ALLOWING OUR STUDENTS TO

02:31:30.881 --> 02:31:32.550
BE EXPOSED TO AN AREA

02:31:32.616 --> 02:31:34.518
POTENTIALLY BEING IN AN AREA.

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:36.187
WHERE THEY CAN BE USED FOR

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:39.690
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS I'M IN

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:41.459
UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:44.361
ENVIRONMENT CAN CAN EVOLVE IN IN

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.430
CERTAIN AREAS IT JUST MAKES ME A

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:48.466
BIT NERVOUS TO FOR THAT BUT FOR

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:51.368
GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW- ENDEAVORS

02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:53.637
HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS TO ME

02:31:53.704 --> 02:31:55.406
THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF-

02:31:55.473 --> 02:31:57.641
PROTECTION IN THAT SPACE VERSUS

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:59.310
LEAVING IT OPEN FOR A

02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:00.711
SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT SAYS HERE

02:32:00.778 --> 02:32:04.148
POLITICAL EVENTS AND THEN. EVEN

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:06.083
IT OPEN ONCE AGAIN TO YOU I.

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:08.652
EXCUSED ABSENCES IN THE

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:09.320
DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL

02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:11.055
ADMINISTRATOR AND IF THERE IS-

02:32:11.121 --> 02:32:13.257
AFFILIATIONS WITH A SCHOOL

02:32:13.324 --> 02:32:14.792
ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE LOCAL I.

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:16.861
CANDIDATE IN A LOCAL PART IN

02:32:16.927 --> 02:32:18.329
GRANITE. FOR ME THIS WOULD BE

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:19.463
FABULOUS BECAUSE I'M VERY ENGAGE

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.432
WITH MY AT MY LOCAL SCHOOLS AND

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:23.801
I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SO. I

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:26.237
YOU KNOW. PASSING THIS WOULD BE

02:32:26.303 --> 02:32:28.439
A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME. BUT

02:32:28.506 --> 02:32:30.641
I'M LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE IT

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:34.545
MAY NOT BE SO- POSITIVE ERROR OR

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:35.746
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:39.783
CONTENTIOUS. AND- AND THAT

02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:40.751
ACTUALLY IT'S ALL GIVEN

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:42.620
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:43.721
THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

02:32:43.787 --> 02:32:46.223
RIGHT NOW THAT IT WOULD IT COULD

02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:47.491
POTENTIALLY BE EXPLOITED. FOR

02:32:47.558 --> 02:32:50.394
CAMPAIGN PURPOSES FOR PERSONAL

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:53.497
BENEFIT OF LOCAL- CANDIDATES

02:32:53.564 --> 02:32:55.833
AND- ELECTED'S. SALATA IMPACT

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:58.469
THEIR SENATOR CHOI BOGUE BUT LET

02:32:58.536 --> 02:32:59.737
ME I'LL GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT. SO

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:02.540
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- TO YOUR

02:33:02.606 --> 02:33:03.507
POINT SENATOR GLAZERS PONTS

02:33:03.574 --> 02:33:05.576
ABOUT US SCHOOLS ALREADY DOING

02:33:05.643 --> 02:33:07.611
THIS I WILL GO BACK TO WHAT I

02:33:07.678 --> 02:33:11.549
pDOING THAT AND IF YOU BOTH ARE

02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:12.149
IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.684
DOING THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL. BUT

02:33:13.751 --> 02:33:15.486
IT'S NOT HAPPENING EVERYWHERE UP

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:16.854
AND DOWN THE STATE SO THIS BILL

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:18.255
IS A SMALL ATTEMPT TO HELP THAT

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:20.357
HAPPEN SECONDLY I WOULD SAY

02:33:20.424 --> 02:33:21.825
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

02:33:21.892 --> 02:33:23.761
POLITICS IS A PART OF GOVERNMENT

02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:25.396
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF

02:33:25.462 --> 02:33:27.131
POLITICAL PARTIES DON'T ELECT

02:33:27.197 --> 02:33:28.599
PEOPLE WE WOULDN'T HAVE SCHOOL

02:33:28.666 --> 02:33:30.634
BOARDS WE WOULDN'T HAVE CITY

02:33:30.701 --> 02:33:32.536
COUNCILS IF THOSE FOLKSWERE NOT

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:34.204
ELECTED WE WOULDN'T HAVE A STATE

02:33:34.271 --> 02:33:35.439
GOVERNMENT. IF THOSE FOLKS WERE

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:41.111
NOT ELECTED SO POLITICS IS. THE

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:43.213
REASON WE ARE HERE AND HAVE A

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:43.781
GOVERNMENT. DO I THINK THE

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:45.482
PEOPLE COULD BE EXPLOITED PEOPLE

02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:46.884
COULD BE EXPLOITED ON ANY NUMBER

02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:47.952
OF DIFFERENT THINGS- AND I DON'T

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:49.853
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASON TO

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:51.589
NOT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. THIS

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:53.257
IS ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SURE

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:55.392
THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:57.227
OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW

02:33:57.294 --> 02:33:58.395
GOVERNMENT WORKS AND TO

02:33:58.462 --> 02:34:00.497
UNDERSTAND AND IT MAY BE A

02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:01.632
POLITICAL THEY MAY GO TO A

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:03.067
POLITICAL EVENT THEY MAY NOT

02:34:03.133 --> 02:34:04.735
THEY MAY GO TO A SCHOOL BOARD

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.670
MEETING THEY MAY GO TO A CITY

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:09.173
COUNCIL MEETING. THEY MAY FLY UP

02:34:09.239 --> 02:34:09.773
HERE AND PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:10.975
OUR HEARINGS THERE ARE A VARIETY

02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:11.842
OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:14.411
COULD PARTICIPATE IN- THERE WAS

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:16.180
ONE OTHER THING YOU SAID THEY

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:17.514
WANT TO ADDRESS BUT IS ESCAPING

02:34:17.581 --> 02:34:20.618
ME- AS- THE BILL. IS FOR ONE DAY

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:21.685
ONE DAY OF EXCUSED ABSENCE THE

02:34:21.752 --> 02:34:24.221
PORTION YOU'RE READING. AT THE

02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:26.657
SCHOOL CAN ALWAYS ALLOW STUDENTS

02:34:26.724 --> 02:34:28.525
TO BE GONE LONGER- WHEN MY

02:34:28.592 --> 02:34:30.494
DAUGHTERS WERE IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL

02:34:30.561 --> 02:34:31.862
ONE OF THEM WHAT CUT EXCUSE FOR

02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:34.365
TWO WEEKS FROM THE SCHOOL. TO

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:36.467
TRAVEL TO- HOLLAND WITH MY

02:34:36.533 --> 02:34:38.369
HUSBAND BECAUSE WE FELT THAT HER

02:34:38.435 --> 02:34:41.071
EXPERIENCE IN HOLLAND FOR TWO

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:42.773
WEEKS WAS GOING TO BE. I HATE TO

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:45.009
SAY THIS UP MORE LIFE CHANGING A

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.543
BENEFICIAL THEN THE TWO WEEKS

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.612
YOU WOULD HAVE SPENT IN FOURTH

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:49.613
GRADE. SO THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.582
THERE AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO

02:34:51.649 --> 02:34:52.750
THE DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL

02:34:52.816 --> 02:34:54.885
THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:57.554
THIS BILL. ALLOWS FOR ONE DAY

02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:59.556
FOR A CIVICS ENGAGEMENT. I GUESS

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:01.492
TO THAT I WOULD SAY BECAUSE I

02:35:01.558 --> 02:35:02.626
WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE

02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:04.695
CIVIC PART OF IT AND HOW. THAT

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:06.563
LINE BUT THE FACT THAT IT.

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:07.131
CREATES THE POLITICAL EVENT

02:35:07.197 --> 02:35:08.499
PART. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME

02:35:08.565 --> 02:35:09.533
NERVOUS THAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:10.868
WITH THAT WITH THAT IT IS

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:12.670
BECAUSE AS I EXPLAINED WITHOUT

02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:14.538
POLITICS. WE DON'T HAVE CIVICS

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:15.472
AND WE DON'T HAVE GOVERNMENT

02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:16.807
WHETHER WE LIKE OUR POLITICAL

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:19.910
PROCESS OR NOT. IT IS JUST THIS

02:35:19.977 --> 02:35:21.645
IS HOW WE GET GOVERNMENT. I

JUST THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS

02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:09.486
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ASPECT OF

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:10.954
IT. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.528
OF EVENTS. DURING SCHOOL WE HAVE

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:20.497
GOVERNMENT'S CLASSES IN

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:21.331

GIVE THE STUDENTS THAT THE

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:36.780
RESPONSE THE EXPERIENCES I THINK

02:42:36.847 --> 02:42:38.748
LOCAL CONTROL IS VERY IMPORTANT

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:40.550
IF LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING

02:42:40.617 --> 02:42:42.552

02:43:04.641 --> 02:43:06.576
THINK WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN

PLACE. IT CAN ALREADY HAPPEN- SO

02:43:09.713 --> 02:43:10.881

DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE WILL

02:43:24.394 --> 02:43:26.463
AUTOMATICALLY DO IT BUT WHAT IT

02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:28.532
DOES DO. IS IT MAKES STUDENTS

02:43:28.598 --> 02:43:30.534
AWARE OF IT SO IF LOCALLY THE

02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:32.269
