01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.804
THAT IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.439
ALREADY EXISTING CLASSES IN

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.108
TREATMENT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.976
HAVE TO PASS A PASTOR ANYTHING

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.545
LIKE THAT ASSEMBLY HAVE TO

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:26.881
ATTEND THE CLASSES AND COMPLETE

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:27.849
THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS.

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.083
YEAH BECAUSE THE INFERENCES THAT

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:31.219
SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION MEANS THAT

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.754
THEY HAVE OVERCOME THE ADDICTION

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.622
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.958
WHAT- IS BEING. ALLEGED HERE MY

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:40.562
RIGHT. I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:42.463

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.666
TO SAY OFTENTIMES IN DRUG COURT

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:47.201
FOR EXAMPLE. THE TERM OVERCOMING

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:48.636
OR BEING SUCCESSFUL WITH AN

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.204
ADDICTION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:52.507
IS ACHIEVABLE ADDICTION AND I'M

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:53.508
SURE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:55.310

SEEMS TO ME AND LOOKING AT THE

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:46.847
COMPOSITION OF THIS COMMISSION

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:49.816
THAT THERE IS NO INCLUSION OF-

WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T SAY THAT

KNOW THAT THE VICTIMS OF CRIME

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.360
ARE MOST LIKELY. TO ALSO BE

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:01.294

BY THE FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.169
SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.370
THERE'S LIKELY TO BE OVERLAP.

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.405

JURISDICTIONAL LINES COMPILING

ALL THOSE- ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:52.858
OFFENSES. AND THERE IS ACTUALLY

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:59.365
CONSTITUTIONAL- RIGHT TO. THE

02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:01.433
END OF THAT THAT THE ACLU IS

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:02.635
TIME NOT JURY SHOPPING THERE'S

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:03.202
NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:04.603
HAVING A TRIAL WHERE YOU WANT

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.572
ITS WORD. THE CRIME ACTUALLY

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:09.608
OCCURRED SELF I'M SURE YOU

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:11.510

02:04:11.577 --> 02:04:13.646
NEXT. YEAH THANKS FOR THE

02:04:13.712 --> 02:04:15.815
QUESTION- ASSEMBLY ONE. WITH

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:18.050
RESPECT TO FOREIGN SHOP AND I

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.586
WOULD ASSERT THAT. DA'S ARE

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:22.354
GOING TO BRING FORWARD THE CASE

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:23.155
THAT AROSE FROM THEIR

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:24.890
JURISDICTIONS WE'RE GONNA WANT

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:27.026
TO BRING FOR IT A ORGANIZED

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:28.460
RETAIL THEFT THAT HAPPENED IN

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:30.596
THE COUNTY OF VENTURA- THERE HAS

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:32.164
TO BE AS WE ALL KNOW SOME NEXUS

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:34.366
SOME CALLS A LINK TO OUR COUNTY-

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:36.435
I THINK IN A VERY EXCEEDINGLY

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:37.870
RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD IT

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:40.105
SIMPLY BE THE MERCHANDISE- WE

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:41.640
WOULD WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN-

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:45.611
O. R. T. IN OUR COUNTY- THAT

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:46.779
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:50.282
THEN WITH RESPECT TO- HOW DO WE

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:53.085
MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE OTHER

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:55.521
COUNTIES AND- OFFENSES THAT

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:58.123
HAPPENED THERE- SERIOUSLY AND

02:04:58.190 --> 02:04:59.291
RECOGNIZE BOTH DEFENDANTS AND

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:01.694
VICTIMS. I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:04.396
THAT. IN OUR WORLD. OUR

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.866
CASELOADS ARE OVERWHELMING. SO

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:08.100
IN THE CASE OF THE SHERIFF

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:10.736
MENTIONED- THERE WAS A TWO

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:12.605
PERSON CREW THAT WENT INTO A

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.406
NUMBER OF BEAUTY SUPPLY STORES.

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:17.743
BASED TOLD ALL TOTAL THIRTY NINE

02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:19.912
THOUSAND AND HIGH END PERFUMES

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:22.214
AND BEATY SUPPLY ITEMS. AND WE

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:23.449
LEARN THAT ONE MEMBER OF THE

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:26.585
CREW WAS BEING INVESTIGATED AND

02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:27.953
FOR OTHER COUNTIES SAMBAR TO

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.790
DINO RIVERSIDE LA IN SAN DIEGO

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:35.160
FOR ALLEGE LOSSES UP TO HUNDRED

02:05:35.227 --> 02:05:35.794
FIFTY THOUSAND WHAT ARE OFFICE

02:05:35.861 --> 02:05:37.830
WOULD DO SENSE. SUPPORTERS AND

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:39.698
ALL THIS MADERA COUNTY WERE

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:41.500
VICTIMS OF A R. T. WE WOULD

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:42.601
CONTACT THOSE OTHER

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:44.370
JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH SAY WE

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:46.338
HAD THE CRIME HAPPENED HERE CAN

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:48.307
WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR CASES

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:49.842
AND PUT THEM INTO A SINGLE

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:51.510
PROSECUTION. I BELIEVE THEY

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.779
WOULD WELCOME THAT BECAUSE ONE

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:55.614
THEY WANT SOMEBODY TO BE THAT

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:56.615
QUARTERBACK SOMEBODY NEEDS TO

02:05:56.682 --> 02:05:58.317
STEP FORWARD AND SAY THIS IS A

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:00.419
REIGNING IT'S SOPHISTICATED IN

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:02.454
ORDER TO DISMANTLE IT WE NEED TO

02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:04.156
BE EQUALLY COORDINATED AND IN

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:07.693
SYNC. AND WITH RESPECT TO-

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.462
LASTLY UST TO ADDRESS YOUR

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.164
COMMENT AND QUESTION. YOU KNOW

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:14.667
THE JURY WOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:17.469
INDEED BE A JURY OF PEERS- IT

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:20.139
WOULD BE SELECTED THROUGH THE

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:22.675
SAFEGUARDS THERE NOW IN PLACE TO

02:06:22.741 --> 02:06:25.044
THIRTY SEVENTY ANOTHER LOSS. AND

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.679
I BELIEVE THAT DEFENDANTS

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:28.714
WHEREVER THEY ARISE WHEN THEY

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.916
COME INTO COUNTIES AND- ARE

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:33.018
BROUGHT FORWARD ON THESE CASES.

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:35.854
THEY WILL RECEIVE FAIR AND

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:37.089
PUBLIC JURY TRIALS IN ACCORDANCE

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:40.793
WITH THE LAW. ANY OTHER

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:44.797
QUESTIONS CONCERNED. WITH WEBER

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:57.876
. GOOD MORNING- SO I- I JUST

02:06:57.943 --> 02:07:00.212
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- THE

02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:01.847
LANGUAGE SO WE KEEP TALKING

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.949
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.484
FOCUSING ON ORGANIZED RETAIL

02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:10.622
THEFT WHICH I COMPLETELY GET- IT

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:11.590
SAYS THIS BILL WOULD

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:12.992
ADDITIONALLY ESTABLISH THE

02:07:13.058 --> 02:07:14.426
JURISDICTION OF A CRIMINAL

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:16.895
ACTION FOR THEFT. ORGANIZED

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.564
RETAIL THEFT OR RECEIPT OF

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:21.867
STOLEN PROPERTY NEVADA SO IT.

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.702
HOW DO IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:26.638
SAY ONLY ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:29.308
SO WHY ARE WE FOCUSING JUST ON

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:30.476
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WHEN

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:32.344
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BUT

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:34.113
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT STATES

02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:35.647
HEARING ABOUT. THE BILL IS AIMED

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:37.383
AT ADDRESSING- THE SAME

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:39.251
DEFENDANTS. THE SAME TYPE OF

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:41.587
MERCHANDISE AND THE THEFT OF

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:43.288
WHICH IS DONE ACCORDING TO A

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:45.224
COMMON PLAN OR SCHEME. HENCE THE

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:46.892
SOPHISTICATION HENCE THE

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:49.061
ORGANIZED NATURE OF THE CRIME SO

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.195
YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIMILAR

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:52.164
PATTERNS OF CONDUCT ACROSS

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:53.832
COUNTIES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:57.336
LINES. THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT A

02:07:57.403 --> 02:07:59.705
WAR T. NOW. THERE'S LANGUAGE

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:01.306
THAT WAS ADDED ABOUT WHAT WE

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:04.743
CALL THE ATTENDANT- PEACE IS A

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.079
CRIME THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.714
FOR EXAMPLE PERHAPS A CONSPIRACY

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:11.483
CHARGE IT MAY BE A GRAND THEFT

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.485
FORTY SEVEN ABOVE THE VALUE OF

02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:15.020
NINE FIFTY THAT WOULD REQUIRE

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:17.489
THE PERMISSION OF THE ENTITY

02:08:17.556 --> 02:08:19.792
FROM WHICH WE ARE TAKING HE

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.126
CASE- VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S IN

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:23.128
LAW AT SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR POINT

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:24.430
SEVEN OF THE PENAL CODE. SO

02:08:24.496 --> 02:08:26.365
THERE IS A SAFEGUARD IF WE GO

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:28.700
BEYOND SIMPLY THE ORGANIZED

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.235
RETAIL THEFT WE HAVE TO

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:31.403
COMMUNICATE WITH THAT OTHER

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:33.572
JURISDICTION AND SAY. MISTER OR

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:35.374
MISS DA DO WE HAVE YOUR

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.309
AUTHORITY TO TAKE THAT CASE

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:39.078
BECAUSE IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE

02:08:39.144 --> 02:08:40.779
STRICT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:43.615
RIGHT NOW SO IT'S A GOOD

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:45.517
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. I GUESS

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:48.287
MY CONCERN IS- WITH IT BEING

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:50.556
MORE PRIDE THAT YOU CAN PULL IN

02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:52.091
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY A

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.525
PART OF THE ORGANIZED RETAIL

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:55.160
THEFT AND I'M HOPING THAT

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:56.328
THERE'S SOME LEGAL DEFINITION OF

02:08:56.395 --> 02:08:58.063
IT SOMEWHERE. WHAT EXACTLY

02:08:58.130 --> 02:08:59.998
ENTAILS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.700
LIKE A CERTAIN NUMBER AND YOU

02:09:01.767 --> 02:09:03.135
KNOW PROOF THAT PEOPLE HAVE

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:04.036
ACTUALLY GOTTEN TOGETHER AND

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:06.338
IT'S NOT JUST. SOMEONE WHO

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.874
HAPPENED TO GO IN AND- STILL

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:09.475
SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE FROM A

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:12.010
RETAILER. HE HAD THE BEST GUIDE

02:09:12.077 --> 02:09:12.945
TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:14.246
WEBER WOULD BE LOOK AT THE

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:15.514
LANGUAGE OF FOUR NINETY POINT

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.016
FOUR- YOU KNOW. INDIVIDUALS

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.551
ACTING IN CONCERT THAT'S

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:20.652
IMPORTANT HAS TO BE SOME

02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:21.787
COORDINATION SOME PLANNING

02:09:21.854 --> 02:09:24.123
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM- THERE

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:26.125
HAS TO BE USUALLY SIMILAR

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:28.127
MERCHANDISE THAT'S TAKEN. COMMON

02:09:28.193 --> 02:09:29.695
PLANS OR SCHEMES THAT IS THEY'RE

02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:31.663
USING THE SAME MODUS OPERANDI

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.899
HI. IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:35.534
DIFFERENT STORES BUT THE SAME

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:38.103
AMMO IS EMPLOYED. HMM AND ALSO

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:39.805
THE SAME DEFENSE YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:41.974
WE'RE BASICALLY EXAMINING THE

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.442
SAME CONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE

02:09:43.509 --> 02:09:45.477
SAME PEOPLE IT JUST HAPPENS TO

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:46.945
GO ACROSS COUNTY LINES. AND

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:48.714
HAPPEN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:49.915
BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WAS

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.517
CALIFORNIANS THERE'S A VAST

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:53.118
FREEWAY NETWORK SO IF THEY WANT

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:54.820
TO TARGET HOME DEPOTS THEY'RE

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:56.155
GONNA GO TO MULTIPLE HOME DEPOTS

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:58.290
IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES. WHICH IS

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:00.259
WHY THIS BILL IS SO URGENT NEED

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:01.627
SO THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:04.796
TO. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED

02:10:04.863 --> 02:10:07.633
TO HAVE DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:09.434
NOT JUST ONE TIME. SURE YEAH I

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:11.503
MEAN THIS IS. THIS IS GOING

02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:14.740
AFTER A SERIAL ISSUE IT'S NOT A

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:16.808
ONE TIME ACT IT'S HAPPENING IN

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:19.044
OTHER COUNTIES NOT ONLY BEEN

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:20.646
TURRETS WHAT THIS DOES FOR

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.648
JUDICIAL ECONOMY AND TO PRESERVE

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:24.550
SCARCE JUDICIAL RESOURCES. IS

02:10:24.616 --> 02:10:27.085
BRING THAT CASE INTO OUR COUNTY

02:10:27.152 --> 02:10:28.620
THAT AROSE AND SAMPOERNA DINO

02:10:28.687 --> 02:10:30.589
RIVERSIDE OR ELSEWHERE OR SAN

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:32.991
DIEGO COUNTY. BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.193
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:35.961
FOUR DIFFERENT PROSECUTIONS IN

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:37.896
FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND I

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.164
ALSO WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU IF

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:41.667
YOU'RE THE DEFENDANT. THEN YOU

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:42.935
TOO COULD BE PROSECUTED SAN

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:45.170
DIEGO COUNTY AND THEN YOU MAY BE

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:46.572
IN CUSTODY OR CONVICTED THEN

02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:47.873
THERE'S AN ORDER FOR PRODUCTION

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:49.942
FOR YOU TO APPEAR NOW IN LA

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:52.578
COUNTY. SO YOU KNOW THIS GOES

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:57.282
BOTH WAYS. OKAY MISTER BRYANT.

02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:58.450
I'LL BE QUICK UP STRUGGLING WITH

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:01.386
THIS BILL ACCENT OF THE AT THE

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:02.654
AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS- WHAT'S TO

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:04.423
PREVENT- DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:05.757
FROM STACKING CHARGES THAT OTHER

HAVE ALL THESE MULTIPLE. YOU'RE

02:17:07.152 --> 02:17:08.587
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE REASON WHY

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:10.622
TO SEIZE P. WORKS BECAUSE CHP IS

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:12.357
DOING IT BY THEMSELVES AND

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:14.125
THEY'RE GETTING IT DONE LOOK AT

02:17:14.192 --> 02:17:15.260
THEIR ARREST RECORD LOOK AT

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:17.028
THEIR SUCCESS RECORD IT'S

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:19.497
UNBELIEVABLE IS OFF THE CHARTS

02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:20.665
BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE KIND

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:22.734
OF. THEY'RE NOT GETTING. THE

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:25.036
CREDIT THAT THEY NEED THEY DID

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:28.006
DESERVE TO SHOW THAT. AND AGAIN

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:30.008
IN FULL DISCLOSURE IT IS MY BILL

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.877
THAT THE ORGANIZED RETAILS THE

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:34.713
BILL DOES WORK. I'LL SAY IT

02:17:34.779 --> 02:17:36.815
AGAIN THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:42.120
BILL MY BILL DOES WORK- AND SO I

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:43.254
I'M SAYING WE NEED TO WORK

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:46.391
TOGETHER. AND BRING IT ALL BACK

02:17:46.458 --> 02:17:50.362
IN TOGETHER SO THAT- IF IT

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:52.430
DOESN'T PASS YOU ASK FOR

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:54.666
RECONSIDERATION. AND IN THAT

02:17:54.733 --> 02:17:56.134
RECONSIDERATION WE COME BACK

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:58.370
AGAIN WE CAN WORK ON OUR

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:00.038
ULTIMATE SOLUTION. THAT WILL GET

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:03.575
RID OF THE SCOURGE. IN A IN A

02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:04.309
MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND THAT

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:08.113
WE ATTACK IT TOGETHER. NOT A

02:18:08.179 --> 02:18:10.715
PART BECAUSE THE OTHER PART OF

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:11.583
THAT WHICH IS THE OPPOSITION

02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:14.786
CONCERNED ABOUT. STACKING AND

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.621
YOU KNOW YOU COULD ASK RODNEY

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:18.823
KING ABOUT BEING. GOING TO SEAMY

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:23.061
VALLEY. THEY HAVE JUSTICE BEING

DONE IT IN QUITE WORK FOR HIM.

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:27.999
SO THAT IS THE ULTIMATE CONCERN

02:18:28.066 --> 02:18:30.435
IS A CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:33.071
USED AGAINST. PROGRESSIVE D.

02:18:33.138 --> 02:18:35.540

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:42.480
JUST GOT WE JUST GOT TO STOP

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:43.415
BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:45.283
SUFFER. ARE NOT ONLY RETAILERS

02:18:45.350 --> 02:18:48.953

COMMITTEES AND COUNTLESS

02:36:19.937 --> 02:36:22.106
MEETINGS WITH ADVOCATE SO I KNOW

02:36:22.172 --> 02:36:23.474
THAT THERE'S SOME CONSTERNATION

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:25.075

IT'S KIND OF IT'S ENCOURAGED

02:38:25.729 --> 02:38:27.798

02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:39.276
VOLUNTARY WHEN FAMILY MEMBERS GO

02:38:39.343 --> 02:38:40.978

THEY GOT BUT EVENTUALLY- THEY

02:38:51.989 --> 02:38:54.458
ARE ABLE TO GET HELP AND SO WE

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:56.226
KNOW THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. IS

02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:57.828
NOT WORKING THIS IS THIS IS NOT

02:38:57.895 --> 02:38:59.963
THE SAME AS WHAT THE GOVERNOR

02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:01.632
TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK WITH

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:02.599
CONSERVATORSHIP. BUT THE SAME

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:04.134
SIMILAR ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THE

CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING WAY

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:07.204
TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH-

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:09.573

THIS OUT IN A NUMBER OF

02:39:27.624 --> 02:39:29.226
COUNTIES. AND WE THINK THIS WILL

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:31.094
PRODUCE. RESULTS THROUGHOUT

02:39:31.161 --> 02:39:32.496

SOME CONCERNS IN A VETO MESSAGE

02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:40.337

PROVIDERS AND WE ARE IN STRONG

02:47:18.928 --> 02:47:20.430
OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN TWENTY

LAST YEAR AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO-

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:28.838
AND- IN DARK. WE HAVE A STRONG

02:47:28.905 --> 02:47:30.006
COALITION OF TREATMENT ADVOCATES

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:31.608
AS WELL AS STRESS THE SYSTEM

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:33.777
ADVOCATES BETTER IN OPPOSITION

02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:36.146
TO THE BILL- WOULD LIKE TO READ

02:47:36.212 --> 02:47:38.415
THAT- YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEW SO

02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:40.417
I'M I'M VETO THIS BILL LAST YEAR

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:42.485
STATING THAT I AM CONCERNED THAT

02:47:42.552 --> 02:47:43.953
THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE THAT

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:45.188
EFFECTIVELY READS TO FORCE

02:47:45.255 --> 02:47:47.023
TREATMENT. I AM ESPECIALLY

02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:48.358
CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:49.659
SUCH TREATMENT GIVEN THAT

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.494
EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT COURSE

02:47:51.561 --> 02:47:52.529
THE TREATMENT HINDERS

02:47:52.595 --> 02:47:54.764
PARTICIPANTS LONG TERM RECOVERY.

02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:56.032
I FROM THEIR SUBSTANCE USE

02:47:56.099 --> 02:47:57.867
DISORDER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

02:47:57.934 --> 02:47:59.969
THE- CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:02.071
WERE DRESSED IN AB NINETEEN

02:48:02.138 --> 02:48:05.008
TWENTY EIGHT- AND YOU KNOW JUST

02:48:05.074 --> 02:48:07.210
TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE I'M-

02:48:07.277 --> 02:48:09.612
THIS BILL IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED

02:48:09.679 --> 02:48:11.481
ON WHICH OUR SYSTEM OF ADDICTION

02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:12.615
TREATMENT THROUGH THE PUBLIC

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.517
SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT UPON

02:48:14.584 --> 02:48:16.553
THROUGH A SAM. AND THREE MEDIC

02:48:16.619 --> 02:48:18.721
COW MEDIC COW CANNOT COVER THE

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:21.124
COST OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE SEE

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:22.992
THAT THIS BILL IT'S BEEN

02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:23.726
EXPANDED TO ADDITIONAL COUNTIES

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:26.996
THIS YEAR- AND WE FEAR- YOU KNOW

02:48:27.063 --> 02:48:28.965
AT THAT. THE OUTCOMES AT THE END

02:48:29.032 --> 02:48:31.301
OF THE DAY WILL NOT BE WHAT THE

02:48:31.367 --> 02:48:33.536
LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING FOR-

02:48:33.603 --> 02:48:35.738
IT'LL HARM PARTICIPANTS AND WE

02:48:35.805 --> 02:48:38.775
ALSO- OR SIGN THIS BILL IS ALSO

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:41.711
NOT A NEW IDEA- THIS IS BEEN

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.980
TRIED BEFORE. WE NEED TO FOCUS

02:48:44.047 --> 02:48:45.882
MORE ON VOLUNTARY TREATMENT

02:48:45.949 --> 02:48:47.283
INVESTMENT AND HOUSING AND

02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:50.520
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES NOT INTO AB

02:48:50.587 --> 02:48:51.354
NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE

RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO

CHAIR NUMBERS- LISA LEWIS HERE

02:49:00.563 --> 02:49:01.564
ON BEHALF THE DRUG POLICY

02:49:01.631 --> 02:49:03.700

02:49:07.837 --> 02:49:09.138
COMPASSION HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:10.974
RIGHTS WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.909
STILL WITH THIS BILL- OF JULY

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.410
TENSION TO TWO OF THEM. THE

02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.778
FIRST IS THE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE

02:49:15.845 --> 02:49:17.480
ON BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS

02:49:17.547 --> 02:49:19.148
THE BILL STILL FAILS TO ENSURE

02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:21.017
THE PILOTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

02:49:21.084 --> 02:49:22.652
IN A RACIALLY EQUITABLE MANNER.

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:23.753
TO PREVENT THE UNNECESSARY

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:25.388
INCARCERATION OF BLACK AND BROWN

02:49:25.455 --> 02:49:27.991
INDIVIDUALS. ARREST RATES FROM

02:49:28.057 --> 02:49:29.058
TWENTY TWENTY DEMONSTRATE THAT

02:49:29.125 --> 02:49:30.059
BLACK AND LATINOS HAVE UNFAIRLY

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:31.895
TARGETED HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY

02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:33.463
TARGETED FOR DRUG ARRESTS.

02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:35.665
LATINOS CONSIST CONSTITUTED

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:37.133
FORTY TWO POINT 4% OF ALL FELONY

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:38.468
DRUG ARREST AND WHAT

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:39.836
CALIFORNIANS MADE UP THIRTEEN

02:49:39.903 --> 02:49:41.504
POINT 3% OF ARRESTED DESPITE

02:49:41.571 --> 02:49:44.774
MAKING UP ONLY SIX POINT 5% OF

02:49:44.841 --> 02:49:45.575
THE STATE'S POPULATION. THE

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:46.576
SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THE BILLS

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:48.444
OPPOSED BY EVERY STATE TREATMENT

02:49:48.511 --> 02:49:49.646
ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. THE

02:49:49.712 --> 02:49:51.514
SCIENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE

02:49:51.581 --> 02:49:53.249
EFFICACY OF COURSE TREATMENT.

02:49:53.316 --> 02:49:55.485
AND ON THE CONTRARY DEMONSTRATES

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:56.085
THAT IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:57.654
AND COSTLY. TREATMENT

02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:58.988
PROFESSIONALS RECOMMEND MOVING

02:49:59.055 --> 02:50:00.957
AWAY FROM MANDATED TREATMENT AND

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:01.791
TOWARDS EVIDENCE BASED

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.593
APPROACHES THAT WE KNOW WORK.

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:04.694
THIS INCLUDES LOW BARRIER

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.362
COMMUNITY DRUG TREATMENT

02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:07.664
OVERDOSE OVERDOSE PREVENTION

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:09.065
PROGRAMS AND CULTURALLY

02:50:09.132 --> 02:50:11.100
RESPONSIVE OUTREACH. THE PATH TO

02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:13.503
RECOVERY IS NOT LINEAR IT OFTEN

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:14.971
INVOLVES RELAPSES AND FOR THIS

02:50:15.038 --> 02:50:16.739
REASON WE MUST INSTEAD INVESTING

02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:18.908
RESOURCES INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:19.976
TO FACILITATE TREATMENT AND

02:50:20.043 --> 02:50:21.945
ROMAN ONCE A PERSON IS READY TO

02:50:22.011 --> 02:50:24.414
TAKE THAT STEP. AB NINETEEN

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:25.882
TWENTY EIGHT WITH THE TRACK FROM

02:50:25.949 --> 02:50:27.383
THESE EFFORTS AND DIVERT

02:50:27.450 --> 02:50:28.985
RESOURCES THAT COULD BE BETTER

02:50:29.052 --> 02:50:29.886
USED IN THE COMMUNITY. WE DO NOT

02:50:29.953 --> 02:50:31.387
DISAGREE THAT MORE SHOULD BE

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:32.422
DONE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

02:50:32.488 --> 02:50:34.390
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.625
AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.727
CALIFORNIA. BUT REPACKAGING A

WE'RE HEARING FROM OPPOSITION IS

DIRECTLY. AND EVEN IN THE

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:36.332
EXAMPLE THAT THAT WAS GIVEN

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:37.700
ABOUT A FAMILY MEMBERS THEY SAY

02:54:37.767 --> 02:54:39.368

02:54:39.435 --> 02:54:42.104
THEY SAY YES. THAT THE NO HERE

THEY DON'T. GET THEIR MENTAL

02:55:15.371 --> 02:55:16.305
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HEALTH

02:55:16.372 --> 02:55:18.474

02:55:29.518 --> 02:55:31.954
QUALIFY FOR THIS PILOT PROGRAM

02:55:32.021 --> 02:55:33.222
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A

02:55:33.289 --> 02:55:35.458
QUALIFYING DRUG MOTIVATED FELONY

ATTORNEY THAT THAT IT'S RELATED

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:50.106
TO A DRUG ADDICTION. SO THERE

02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:52.808
OPTION WOULD BE TO EITHER GO TO

JAIL OR GO TO THIS FACILITY

02:55:54.644 --> 02:55:56.946

TO JAIL HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:03.819
REALLY HELP WITH ADDICTION. SO

02:56:03.886 --> 02:56:05.021

RELAPSE NUMBERS WERE BETTER OR

02:56:29.245 --> 02:56:30.846
WORSE THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:56:30.913 --> 02:56:33.149
DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT- BECAUSE WE

02:56:33.215 --> 02:56:34.984

UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME

02:56:56.439 --> 02:56:57.940
VERSUS ACTUALLY. GOING INTO A

02:56:58.007 --> 02:56:58.874
PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS

02:56:58.941 --> 02:57:01.477

THAT THAT THE NATURE OF THE

02:57:08.985 --> 02:57:12.588
OPPOSITION- I WOULD. RECOMMEND

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:14.690

THINGS THAT ARE. EVIDENCE BASED

02:57:21.564 --> 02:57:22.798

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:25.368
ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE LIKE ASM

02:57:25.434 --> 02:57:26.602

02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:08.437
OF FEEDBACK WE WOULD GET. AT THE

02:59:08.504 --> 02:59:11.006
END OF THIS PILOT. YEAH I THINK

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:12.608
THERE IS SOME SUCH A SUGGESTION

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:14.944
IN HERE FROM THAT HAVE SO MANY

02:59:15.010 --> 02:59:16.946
PAPERS IN FRONT OF ME I THINK

02:59:17.012 --> 02:59:19.615
IT'S- NONSENSE. IT ABOUT THE-

02:59:19.682 --> 02:59:26.055
CLEAR. THAT YOU. UNTIL ON THE

02:59:26.122 --> 02:59:28.157
REPORT BACK AND I WOULD THINK

02:59:28.224 --> 02:59:30.392
THAT YEAH WE WOULD WANT TO NOT

JUST TO TRADITIONAL REPORT ON

02:59:32.294 --> 02:59:33.863
THE PILOT HOUSE DOING BUT

02:59:33.929 --> 02:59:37.166
INTERIM MEASURES THROUGHOUT THE

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:39.301

THAT'S WHAT WE DO A PILOT.

02:59:46.542 --> 02:59:47.877
BECAUSE IF THIS WORKS MAYBE WANT

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:49.812
TO GO TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT

02:59:49.879 --> 02:59:50.980

WE DO HAVE THAT HAVE THAT

02:59:52.248 --> 02:59:53.516
REPORTING AND I THINK THAT THE

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:56.552
SUGGESTIONS IN HERE ARE GOOD ONE

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:57.653
SYMBOL. IN CORPORATE THAT INTO

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:01.390

THIS IS FOR AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

03:00:14.036 --> 03:00:16.071
HAS COMMITTED A FELONY BUT WE

03:00:16.138 --> 03:00:17.473
KNOW THAT IT IS A SUBSTANCE

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:21.744
ABUSE DRIVEN- THAT THAT. ACT

03:00:21.810 --> 03:00:24.280
ISSUE HAS CAUSED THEM TO COMMIT

03:00:24.346 --> 03:00:25.814
THAT FELONY- ARE THERE ANY OTHER

03:00:25.881 --> 03:00:28.551
PARAMETERS AROUND. THAT THIS

03:00:28.617 --> 03:00:30.252
BEING AN AVAILABLE OPTION FOR

03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:31.654
THE YES AND I GET SOMEWHAT

03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:33.489
CONFUSED WITH THE FIFTY AND THE

03:00:33.556 --> 03:00:34.723
CHANGES WE TOOK LAST YEAR BUT

03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:36.559
MAYBE I CAN HAVE MY MAIN WITNESS

03:00:36.625 --> 03:00:38.127
THAT THE DA FROM YOLO COUNTY

03:00:38.194 --> 03:00:40.262
MISTER RISING I BELIEVE WE HAD

03:00:40.329 --> 03:00:42.731
IT. THAT WITH THESE WERE NOT-

03:00:42.798 --> 03:00:44.466
STRIKE OFFENSES AND NONVIOLENT

03:00:44.533 --> 03:00:46.602
OFFENSES WOULD BE THE ONES WHO

03:00:46.669 --> 03:00:48.537
WOULD BE KEPT CATEGORIZED HERE

03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:50.739
AND I BELIEVE WE ALSO. EXEMPTED

03:00:50.806 --> 03:00:54.510
OUT- THAT TO NINETY SIX SEX

03:00:54.577 --> 03:00:56.579
CRIMES. IS THAT CORRECT MR

03:00:56.645 --> 03:00:58.314
RISING. THAT'S CORRECT IT WOULD

03:00:58.380 --> 03:01:01.717
NOT APPLY FOR- SECOND CHANCES

03:01:01.784 --> 03:01:03.285
AND THEN SERIOUS AND VIOLENT

03:01:03.352 --> 03:01:05.354
FELONIES WOULD BE EXCLUDED BUT

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:07.022
ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED

03:01:07.089 --> 03:01:09.658
OF A FELONY OFFENSE THAT WAS

03:01:09.725 --> 03:01:11.727
FOUND TO BE DRUG MOTIVATED COULD

03:01:11.794 --> 03:01:15.197
BE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSESSMENT AND

03:01:15.264 --> 03:01:23.372
CHOOSING TREATMENT OVER PRISON.

03:01:23.439 --> 03:01:25.207
WHAT DID YOU HAVE ONE MORE

03:01:25.274 --> 03:01:26.942
QUESTION ONE MORE QUESTION. SO

03:01:27.009 --> 03:01:30.112
ARE ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

03:01:30.179 --> 03:01:32.248
THAT FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY.

03:01:32.314 --> 03:01:33.916
WITH THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:01:33.983 --> 03:01:36.952
PAROLE INSTEAD OF JAIL PROBATION

03:01:37.019 --> 03:01:39.188
INSTEAD OF JAIL TIME. AT THE END

03:01:39.255 --> 03:01:42.258
OF THEIR TERM YES BUT THE BUT

03:01:42.324 --> 03:01:44.260
THEY ARE ARE THEY ARE SENTENCED.

03:01:44.326 --> 03:01:45.494
AND THIS WOULD BE A CHOICE IN

03:01:45.561 --> 03:01:47.663
LIEU OF THEIR SENTENCE SO IN

03:01:47.730 --> 03:01:49.265
OTHER WORDS WE WOULDN'T HAVE

03:01:49.331 --> 03:01:50.666
SOMEBODY GO THROUGH THIS IF THEY

03:01:50.733 --> 03:01:54.103
COULD OTHERWISE BE. SENT HOME-

03:01:54.169 --> 03:01:55.638
MISTER I THINK YOU WANT TO

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:56.805
CLARIFY FOR MISSING ANYTHING

03:01:56.872 --> 03:01:59.742
THERE. NO THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.477
THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:03.045
THAT THE TREATMENT PROGRAM WOULD

03:02:03.112 --> 03:02:05.447
NEVER EXCEED. THE SENTENCE THAT

03:02:05.514 --> 03:02:06.749
THE JUDGE WOULD OTHERWISE GIVE

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:10.185
THE PERSON. AND THAT'S DESIGNED

03:02:10.252 --> 03:02:12.688
SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THIS

03:02:12.755 --> 03:02:13.689
IS NOT TO NOTICE IT'S TREATMENT

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.090
OR WHATEVER THE OTHER

03:02:15.157 --> 03:02:17.059
ALTERNATIVES WHETHER THAT'S

03:02:17.126 --> 03:02:19.194
PRISON OR JAIL. JUST A

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:20.763
CLARIFYING QUESTION ON THAT ARE

03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:22.097
THERE ANY BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED

03:02:22.164 --> 03:02:24.733
NON NON VIOLENCE OF NON SERIOUS

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:27.303
AND TOOK SEVERAL THINGS OUT- IN

03:02:27.369 --> 03:02:28.504
TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY ARE ANY OF

03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:30.239
THE CRIMES THAT WOULD BE IN THIS

03:02:30.306 --> 03:02:31.740
OPTION ONES WITH THE JUDGE

03:02:31.807 --> 03:02:33.475
CURRENTLY HAS THE DISCRETION TO

03:02:33.542 --> 03:02:34.543
SENTENCE YOU TO COMMUNITY

03:02:34.610 --> 03:02:36.312
SUPERVISION INVOLUNTARY.

03:02:36.378 --> 03:02:38.113
TREATMENT CENTER. YEAH I DON'T

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.748
THINK THAT CHANGES I THINK THAT

03:02:39.815 --> 03:02:41.850
THIS I ONLY INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:02:41.917 --> 03:02:45.220
ARE. ARE SENTENCED TO THAT THAT

03:02:45.287 --> 03:02:48.090
THAT TERM SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

03:02:48.157 --> 03:02:50.693
MONSTERS YOUR YEARS AND THIS

03:02:50.759 --> 03:02:52.194
WOULD BE PROVIDED AS AN OPTION I

03:02:52.261 --> 03:02:54.697
DON'T THINK THIS AT ALL- UNDER

03:02:54.763 --> 03:02:56.098
CUTS YOU KNOW JUDICIAL

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:57.933
DISCRETION FRIEND FOR

03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.668
INDIVIDUALS TO BE- YOU KNOW

03:02:59.735 --> 03:03:03.272
PLACE ON COMMUNITY RELEASED HER

03:03:03.339 --> 03:03:04.940
PROBATION. MISTER ISAAC CAN YOU

03:03:05.007 --> 03:03:06.575
CLEAR THAT AS WELL. THAT'S RIGHT

03:03:06.642 --> 03:03:09.645
THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO

03:03:09.712 --> 03:03:10.879
YOU KNOW GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL

03:03:10.946 --> 03:03:13.582
SENSE OF ANY LENGTH. AND IF IT'S

03:03:13.649 --> 03:03:15.617
A- I THINK THE QUESTION IS

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:17.586
FOCUSED ON A VERY SHORT SENTENCE

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:18.787
PERHAPS WITH PROBATIONARY TIME

03:03:18.854 --> 03:03:21.023
AND ENERGY ALL TIME THEN THAT

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:21.757
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AN

03:03:21.824 --> 03:03:24.426
APPROPRIATE. SITUATION FOR THE

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:26.028
TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE. BECAUSE

03:03:26.095 --> 03:03:27.796
IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE TIME

03:03:27.863 --> 03:03:28.530
AVAILABLE FOR THE PERSON TO

03:03:28.597 --> 03:03:30.199
PARTICIPATE THIS IS REALLY

03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:32.701
FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:03:32.768 --> 03:03:33.369
ARE RECEIVING NO LONGER

03:03:33.435 --> 03:03:35.237
SENTENCES PRISON SENTENCES LONG

03:03:35.304 --> 03:03:37.005
JAIL SENTENCES WHO ARE DRUG

03:03:37.072 --> 03:03:39.475
ADDICTED. AND THEIR CRIME WAS

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:40.676
MOTIVATED BY DRUG BUSINESS TO

03:03:40.743 --> 03:03:44.813
GIVE THEM A TREATMENT PATH THAT

03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:45.881
THEY'RE CHOOSING INSTEAD OF. THE

03:03:45.948 --> 03:03:57.092
SENTENCESENTENCE. ANY OTHER

03:03:57.159 --> 03:04:00.596

ON THIS AND- THIS IS AN

03:04:06.402 --> 03:04:08.604
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT IS- AS

03:04:08.670 --> 03:04:10.806
SUMMER BRAIN NOTED. SOMEWHAT

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:13.976
AWKWARD- WORKING ON A BILL THAT

03:04:14.042 --> 03:04:15.077
IS OPPOSED BY INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:04:15.144 --> 03:04:17.946
I'VE- AUTHOR GOES ON WITH THEIR

03:04:18.013 --> 03:04:18.947
SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS ON

03:04:19.014 --> 03:04:20.883
REFORMING OUR YOU KNOW. OUR

03:04:20.949 --> 03:04:24.720
PAROLE- SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA-

03:04:24.787 --> 03:04:26.355

FORMERLY INCARCERATED YOU KNOW

03:04:27.956 --> 03:04:29.391
WORKING ON BANNING THE BOX SO I

03:04:29.458 --> 03:04:31.360
AND I FULLY SUPPORT TO HOW WE

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:32.728
CAN KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE

03:04:32.795 --> 03:04:34.196
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BRING

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:36.331
ABOUT SMART REFORMS. BUT THIS IS

03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:37.199
SOMETHING I'VE COME TO THE

03:04:37.266 --> 03:04:39.301
CONCLUSION THAT THE STATUS QUO

03:04:39.368 --> 03:04:41.203
IS NOT WORKING I DON'T BELIEVE

03:04:41.270 --> 03:04:43.472
IN WAREHOUSING ANY. ANYMORE

03:04:43.539 --> 03:04:45.240
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HI I'M

03:04:45.307 --> 03:04:46.408
TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE

03:04:46.475 --> 03:04:48.811
THAT WE DO HAVE IN THE CRIMINAL

03:04:48.877 --> 03:04:50.112
JUSTICE SYSTEM HOW TO BRING

03:04:50.179 --> 03:04:51.213
ABOUT THE BEST RESULTS FOR THEM.

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:53.549
AND I WILL ADMIT THAT I WOULD

03:04:53.615 --> 03:04:55.217
RATHER. FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN THE

03:04:55.284 --> 03:04:56.952
COMING JUSTICE SYSTEM. ON AND

03:04:57.019 --> 03:04:58.687
YOU KNOW FOCUSING ON SUCCESS IN

03:04:58.754 --> 03:04:59.721
HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT I KNOW

03:04:59.788 --> 03:05:01.190
WE'RE WORKING ON BILLS ON THAT

03:05:01.256 --> 03:05:03.358
ISSUE BUT THIS IS A SEPARATE

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:03.959
ISSUES ARE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:05.360
THEY'RE RELEASED HOW DO WE MAKE

03:05:05.427 --> 03:05:07.362
SURE WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED

03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:08.530
THROUGH ON THE PATH. TO SUCCESS

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:10.532
AND THIS IS- YOU KNOW ONE OF

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:12.468
THOSE. UNCOMFORTABLE ISSUES THEY

03:05:12.534 --> 03:05:14.036
WERE DEALING WITH IN CALIFORNIA

03:05:14.102 --> 03:05:15.771
WE HAVE THE SAME DEBATE ABOUT.

03:05:15.838 --> 03:05:16.438
MENTAL HEALTH AND

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:17.639
CONSERVATORSHIP MAYBE ON THIS

03:05:17.706 --> 03:05:18.807
COMMITTEE BUT THE JUDICIARY

03:05:18.874 --> 03:05:20.442
COMMITTEE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING

03:05:20.509 --> 03:05:22.377
THAT- I THINK WE KNOW THAT WE

03:05:22.444 --> 03:05:24.680
NEED TO FOCUS ON A NEW APPROACH

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:26.448
BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO IS NOT

03:05:26.515 --> 03:05:28.951
WORKING IT'S FAILING US IN

03:05:29.017 --> 03:05:30.586
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PILOT.

03:05:30.652 --> 03:05:32.454
AGAIN IT'S A PILOT THIS ISN'T A

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:34.623
MANDATE FOR CALIFORNIA. WE TRY

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:36.925
THINGS SOMETIMES WE TRY THINGS

03:05:36.992 --> 03:05:38.627
ALL THE TIME SOMETIMES THEY WORK

03:05:38.694 --> 03:05:40.329
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WORK I HOPE

03:05:40.395 --> 03:05:41.697
THIS IS AFFECTED THAT'S THE PLAN

03:05:41.763 --> 03:05:43.398
THAT'S WHY WE'RE OFFERING IT.

03:05:43.465 --> 03:05:44.900
BUT WORST CASE SCENARIO WE

03:05:44.967 --> 03:05:46.835
REALIZE YOU KNOW WHAT. MAYBE

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:48.637
THIS WASN'T AN APPROACH ON IS IT

03:05:48.704 --> 03:05:50.806
GOING TO RUIN LIVES BY HAVING

03:05:50.873 --> 03:05:53.075
PEOPLE DO MORE- DRUG TREATMENT

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:54.009
WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED

03:05:54.076 --> 03:05:55.644
PROBABLY NOT I THINK IT'S THE

03:05:55.711 --> 03:05:58.580
ONLY UPSIDE HERE- AND WITH THAT.
