SPECIFICALLY AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS AFTERNOON'S HEARING THIS REQUEST INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FOR THE SEC C. H. P. AND D. O. J. NINETY FIVE MILLION FOR THREE YEARS FOR THE BSE SEATED ABOUT AN EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT PREVENTION AND VERTICAL PROSECUTION GRANT PROGRAMS.

TO EXPAND AND MAKE PERMANENT IT'S ORGANIZED RETAIL. CRIME TASK FORCE. AND LASTLY SIX MILLION FOR THREE YEARS DECLINING TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN AND I'M GOING FOR THE DOJ TO SUPPORT REGIONAL TASK FORCES COMBATING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. AND TO PROSECUTE CASES THIS PANEL COUPLE JURISDICTIONS AT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THESE FUNDS WILL FOSTER OPEN COMMUNICATION COLLABORATION. AND INNOVATION TO REINFORCE A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY I'M JOINED BY SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM THE SEC. C. H. P. AND D. O. J. AND WE ARE AVAILABLE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS IT'LL OF. LA LAW OFFICE. THANK MANAGER CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE ANALYZE THESE PROPOSALS AND ISSUE ONE AS WELL AS PROPOSALS AND ISSUES TOO AND FOR- ON TODAY'S AGENDA AS PART OF A BROADER PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT CONSISTS OF NINE PROPOSALS AT FIVE WHICH DEAL WITH ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TO WITH FIREARMS. INTO ITS DRUG TRAFFICKING OR OTHER CRIMES WE RECENTLY PUT OUT A PUBLICATION THAT CONTAINS OUR ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS PACKAGE I'M GOING TO GIVE IN- HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF OUR- COMMENDATIONS AN OVERARCHING COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. AND THEN TURN TO SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON TODAY'S AGENDA. AND SO MOVING INTO THOSE OVER TEN COMMENTS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING TWO OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE PACKAGE THAT WE FOUND IDENTIFIED AS BEING REASONABLE. AND THOSE ARE TWO MILLION ON GOING FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER AT UC DAVIS. WHICH IS BEING HEARD IN SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE- AND THE DOJ TASK FORCE PROGRAM FUNDING WHICH IS ISSUE FOR ON TODAY'S AGENDA. REGARDING THE REMAINING FUNDING WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED ITS HIGHEST. PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS SPECIFY CLEAR OBJECTIVES AND THEN ONLINE FINDING IN A MANNER. THAT ENSURES ITS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED. AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PLAN LACKS CLEAR AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING EACH OF ITS STATED GALS- AND WITHOUT OBJECTIVES IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE. EFFECTIVE IN INITIATING OUR CALLS- FOR EXAMPLE- THE GOALAND THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THAT CAN FALL WITHIN ORGANIZED RETAIL FAST AS DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT CAN RANGE FROM TWO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER TO- SHOP LEFT AND RETURNED MERCHANDISE FOR STORE CREDIT TO A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS EXPLOITING OR EVEN TRAFFICKING PEOPLE. TO STEAL ON ITS BEHALF AND SO WITHOUT CLEAR AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IT'S OBJECTIVES IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE REALM OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. ARE INTENDED TO BE TARGETED BY THE GOVERNOR- AND THEN WITHOUT. AND KNOWING WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE TARGETED IT'S DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO EFFECTIVELY PURSUE THOSE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES- OR THOSE TARGETED OBJECTIVES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PRIORITIZE CRIME REDUCTION AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. CRIME DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S SPECIFIC GOALS AS REFLECTED- IN THE PACKAGE MAY NOT BE WELL TARGETED. AND WHILE THERE'S NO OFFICIAL DATA ON ALL REAL RETAIL THEFT IN CALIFORNIA THE CLOSEST REALLY DATA POINT WE HAVE A SHOPLIFTING- THAT DID DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY BY NEARLY TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH SOME AMOUNT OF THAT DECLINE IS LIKELY DUE TO STORE CLOSURES AND PEOPLE MOVING HOME DUE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS STATE HOMEOWNERS IN ONE NIGHT. DURING THE EARLIER PART OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND PRELIMINARY DATA FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE DOES SUGGEST THAT OVERALL LARCENY WHICH INCLUDE SHOPLIFTING IS. INCREASING BUT IT HADN'T RETURNED AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS SO SORT OF THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT WHILE YES CRIME. MAYBE INCREASING OUR RETAILS HAVE MADE INCREASING IT APPEARS TO BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT- I DID DURING A PRETTY SIZEABLE DEBT DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE PANDEMIC- IN CONTRAST. THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- I HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN HOMICIDE AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT THAT COULD MERIT- ATTENTION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOWEVER THAT AND WHILE THERE IS NO. DATE LINE OFFICIAL STATISTICS- SOME EXPERTS AND RETAILERS HAVE OBSERVED AT. AN ANECDOTE IT ANECDOTES- HAVE POINTED TO INCREASED CRIMINAL SOPHISTICATION AND LEVEL OF CRAZINESS AND VIOLENCE INVOLVED IN INCIDENTS OF RETAIL STAFFED SO THAT COULD WARRANT AND LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION ALTHOUGH AS I NOTED THERE ISN'T. VERY GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCALE OF THOSE- ISSUES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CRIME DOES TEND TO TEND TO VARY BY- PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY SOMETIMES BY REGION AND TYPE OF CRIME SO WHILE RETAIL THEFT MAY NOT BE OF SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE CONCERN IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TARGET- IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE STATE. UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN CRAFTING ITS OWN PACKAGE FOCUS ON ADDRESSING ADDRESSING CRIME RELATED PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS OUR PUBLICATION. HAS VARIOUS OPTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THAT GENERALLY EXPAND ON EXISTING PROGRAMS OR- SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR RESEARCH BASED TOOLS OR STRATEGIES SUCH AS- AMPLE CAMERAS ARE USE OF OUR GPS TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE RETAIL THEFT. FOUR TWO AND MORE EFFECTIVELY. ADDRESS IT- AND THEN IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. M. CRIME IS AT A HISTORIC LOW RIGHT NOW SO IT COULD BE REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SIMPLY PRIORITIZE- PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO REDUCING CRIME. THAT CONCLUDES MY OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL JUST TURN TO OUR OUR TWO MAJOR AND CONCERNS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSALS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. BEFORE I CONCLUDE AND THOSE ARE FIRST THAT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE THREE YEAR- PROPOSED THE SEC GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE TWO AND TWO OF WHICH ARE IN THIS AGENDA ITEM AND ONE IS IN THE NEXT- ITEM WOULD PROVIDE THE SEC WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY AFTER THE BUDGET IS ENACTED. AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND USED- WHETHER THE PROGRAMS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE- AND IT MAKES IT HARD TO RULE OUT THAT THE GRANTS WOULD NOT- SUPPLANT LOCAL FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WOULD BE USED IT COULD END UP. GOING TO INCREASING LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROL OF RETAIL LOCATIONS TO PARTICIPATING IN TASK FORCES. OR TO PURCHASING CAMERAS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND BE- OF THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS. AND THEN SECOND CERTAIN PROPOSALS MAY NOT BE TARGETED OR EXCUSE ME MAY NOT BE STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE THEIR DESIRED OUTCOMES. FOR EXAMPLE THE CHP ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TASK FORGET FORCE EXPANSION COULD FACE CHALLENGES BECAUSE HE- C. H. P. CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEDICATE FULL TIME OFFICERS TO THE PROPOSED NEW TASK FORCE IT'S- DUE TO A HIGH. THEY CAN SEE RATE WHICH WE- ARE CONCERNED COULD IMPACT THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED. AND THEN WE KNOW THAT DOJ DOES HAVE EXISTING EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING TASK FORCES- PARTICULARLY THOSE. TARGETING COORDINATED CRIMINAL GANGS ARE NETWORKS AND SO DOJ COULD BE A BETTER AND- ENTITY TO ADMINISTER THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TASK FORCES. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND. I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU WITH A NAIL- OKAY WE COME OUT THE MY CALL- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SIR. YES SIR COURTESY. THANK YOU FOR THE MANAGER JUST A QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- THE NOTICING IN- TO THE L. A. O- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION SO I DID THIS BUT I KIND OF HAD A SIMILAR REACTION PARTICULARLY TO THE FIRST. PIECE OF THIS THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION OF EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM. TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IN I IDEA. AS TO WHAT THE VISION IS FOR THE FLOW OF THOSE DOLLARS IT IS EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN THE IDEAS THAT THEY WOULD DECIDE. HOW TO BEST DEPLOY THOSE DOLLARS. THROUGH THERE ONE FOR SOME ORGANIZATIONS OR- IS IT GOING TO BE MORE SPECIFICITY I'M A TRYING TO IMAGINE. HOW RETAIL. TENDS TO WORK- IN RELATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- IN OUR ARIAN IN PENCIL CAN VALUE TENDS TO BE- RESERVE OFFICERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY DIRECTLY PAID FOR BY THE CITY BUT ARE PAID FOR- TYPICALLY RETIREES THAT ARE PAID FOR THROUGH A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF RETAILERS- AS WE ALL KNOW- REALLY PROVIDE THEIR SECURITY THROUGH- THROUGH PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES- THE DATE THEY DEPLOY AND THAT THEY MANAGE- PRESUMABLY I'LL JUST SAY. IT'S NOT PART OF MY QUESTION BUT I WOULD ASSUME THAT BETWEEN THERE AREN'T. FOR MOST RETAILERS BETWEEN THEIR INSURERS AND THEIR OWN. RISK ANALYSIS LOSS PREVENTION THEY WOULD INVEST IN- IN EITHER RESERVISTS OR OR SECURITY OFFICERS THEMSELVES THAT SAID. LET ME JUST GO BACK TO THE SIMPLE QUESTION HOW WILL THIS MONEY FLOW TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IS AT THE IDEA. I'M NOT SURE THIS IS KATIE HOW ARE WE YES YOU SEE I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU AT- CENTER CORTESE HI GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HOWARD WITH THE ARTISTIC COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS- I WOULD OBSERVE GENERALLY. THAT OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS AS- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES NEW KINDS OF GRANT- YOU GUYS GRANTS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HE HAS TO SEE IF MINISTERS. THERE MIGHT BE A BROAD GOALS STATED INITIALLY AND THEN AS WE WORK THROUGH THE- SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING PROCESS AND GET MORE INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY THE ANALYSIS OF THE- ALLEY- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. YOU KNOW I THINK AS WELL THAT WE OUGHT TO BE- SPECIFYING WHAT THE OBJECTIVES ARE HERE- TO THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION CENTER CORTESE. IS- THE- GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING IN TERMS OF THE EIGHTY FIVE. MILLION DOLLAR PORTION WHICH IS. ANNUALLY FOR THREE YEARS AND YOU KNOW. WHAT THE ELIGIBLE ENTITIES WOULD BE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AT THE CITY LEVEL AND THEN. THE SHERIFFS AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND HOW THE DSCC MINISTERS GRANTS- PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE GRANTS. AND WHEN WE GET INTO- ITEM TOO I MIGHT MAKE SOME OF THE SAME POINTS- FOR EXAMPLE THE- CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT CELTIC I THINK THAT'S A GOOD. SORT OF PARALLEL WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL AN EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE PROCESS I KNOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ARE AWARE AS WELL AS MY- COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL. WE BRING TOGETHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO COME TOGETHER AND CRAFT A GRANT PROPOSAL SO THEY SET OUT- ALL THE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO APPLY BUT THE GRANT AMOUNTS CAN BE AND THEN. AS YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT. WHAT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS AND THINGS WOULD BE SUPPORTED THIS FINDING. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT WITH LATE ALL OF THOSE THINGS OUT. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE BY ALL MEANS FEEL FREE TO. FURTHER SPECIFY OR EVEN PERHAPS. TIGHTEN THE FOCUS AROUND. ORGANIZED RETAIL STAFF BEING THE- CONCERN. IT RAISED MAKES SENSE TO ME WE TALKING ABOUT THE IN X. OBVIOUSLY LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS AND GRABS THE HAD BEEN OVER LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND GET MY MORE DRAMATIC WAY BUT- OUR GRAND WITH LATE OUT- QUITE ON COULD PROPOSALS WOULD BE SO. AN THERE'S ALL- YOU KNOW LANGUAGE OUR CREDIT THAT WOULD DISAPPOINTING CONCERN YEAH I AGREE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT A NEW GRANT PROGRAM WOULD PAY FOR THINGS THAT ENTITIES COULD BE FINDING ANYWAY THE IDEA HERE IS LIKE YES IS TO HAVE NEW TARGETED RESPONSIVE ACTIVITIES TO THIS. ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CONCERN. JUST A FEW THOUGHTS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER. THANK YOU. AND THEN TAKE A FOR THE THOROUGH- A MUCH BEYOND MY EXPECTATION- EIGHT I APPRECIATE THE VISION FOR HOW THINGS WILL WORK AND THEN HOW. IMPLEMENTATION SO SECURE COMMUNICATION. CRITERIA OR GRANT WRITING CRITERIA WILL COME. SHORTLY AFTER THE LEGISLATION. AND IT IS TO THE INVITATION FOR ANY. LEGISLATIVE COMMENT- GUIDELINES ON THIS OR DIRECTION- I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WILL UNFOLD THROUGH A LARGER. A BUDGET COMMITTEE- AS INTO ARCHER- I'M SHOULD BE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE TORTURE ON THIS BUT I DO I DO WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH- BESIDES THE CONCERN ABOUT REDUNDANCY WITH. WHATEVER INSURANCE FOR. INSURERS IN IN WELL HEELED WITH RETAILERS ARE DOING ON THEIR OWN. THE IDEA THAT IT IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE I THINK- THAT TAKES CARE OF A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER ISSUES. RELATIVE TO. THE WAGES- BENEFITS CONCERNS. LIKE THAT THAT THAT WE ARE. IT A SENSE OF- HE HE SUNK OF BLOOM DOES- WAGE PROGRAM- YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT FOR SURE BUT I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY AFFIRMATION OF THAT IDEA I THINK ONCE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES- THEY WILL IT LEASED OUT THE WAGE AND BENEFIT FRAMEWORK ALREADY. SET UP POLICE IN THE MOST RESTRICTIONS- BASED ON THEIR OWN- GOVERNING BOARDS AND COUNCILS AND SO FORTH TO MAKE SURE- THAT- THAT THAT PIECE OF IT'S TAKEN CARE OF SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT SHOES GONNA ANSWER BUT- I'M ALL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT GETTING FUNDING AND I'M ALL FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES- GETTING FUNDING TO ACCESS- OR HIRE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE I KNOW I PERSONALLY SHE'S ARE SHORT SO I'D LIKE SOMEBODY TO TELL ME HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT I THINK LOS ANGELES JUST- SAID THEY WERE GONNA LAUGH ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND SHERIFF'S OFFICERS SO WITH THE SHORTAGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND MY FIRST QUESTION IS AND HOW ARE WE GONNA RETAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO- TAKE ON THESE ADDITIONAL CAP TEST. S. IT'LL HAVE A START THERE IN ALASKA. AT THE TIME I APOLOGIZE- THIS HOWARD DO YOU WANT TO. SURE SOMEWHERE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT- THIS IS A- MY SENSE OF IT ENDED YOU WANT TO. DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR A COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO THEY WOULD KNOW IN A PARTICULAR. DEPARTMENT WHETHER THAT'S AT LEAST DEPARTMENT OF PROBATION ENTITY OR SHERIFF'S OFFICE THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO APPLY FOR A GRANT TO GET FUNDING TO DIFFERENT STRAINS- I CERTAINLY. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT- SOME OF THE OF THE HIRING AND RETENTION ISSUES THAT FACE LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DON'T REALLY HAVE A GREAT ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT IN THIS CONTEXT BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS- IT'S NOT AS IF. ENTITIES WOULD GET THIS FUNDING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO HANDLE OR MANAGE THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY DECIDE- THERE'S THIS BARGAIN NICE RETAIL THEFT GRANT WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND COMPETE. SO I THINK THAT WOULD. SORT ITSELF OUT SOMEWHAT NATURALLY. OKAY YOU AND I ONCE THEY GET THIS GRANT- IN THE ARREST THESE PEOPLE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE LADY AT VENICE BEACH AT THE RITE AID WITH A PICKAXE WALKING AROUND. WITH A PICK AXE ON HER SHOULDER- JUST FILLING UP A BASKET AT LEADING SO I GUESS WEN THEY WHEN THEY GET THESE GRANTS- ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW UNDERCURRENT LAW THEY CAN'T SO. ONCE THEY GET THE GRANTS IN ORDER TO STOP THIS- THIS VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING VIOLENCE AND ROUTE YOU KNOW THEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT SMASH AND GRABS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN OUR STATE- DID YOU KNOW THERE IS A GUY THAT. COMMITTED WAS ARRESTED SIX TIMES IN ONE DAY FOR COMMITTING- THEFT. ROBBERY AND THEFT. BUT THEY CAN'T PROSECUTE HIM OR HOLD THEM SO ARE THESE GRANTS GONNA DO SOMETHING TO HELP. I DON'T KNOW ARREST AND PROSECUTE HIM PUT HIM IN PRISON IN JAIL SO THEY DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE TO COMMIT THESE. CRIMES AGAINST OUR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT ARE BEING HARMED BY THIS IS THERE SOMETHING IN THERE A PROVISION OR SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN. ARE WE JUST GOING TO GIVE THEM FINDING. THEM AND THEY CAN APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS THEY CAN DO THE SPECIAL- THE SPECIAL. CASS FORCE M. HIRE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS. BUT NO ARREST OR PROSECUTION WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE PLACE I GUESS NOT ARREST NO PROSECUTION WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE PLACE ONCE ARRESTED IN IF I MAY CENTER ALSO- AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORTH SHE DOES CONTEMPLATE- VERTICAL PROSECUTION GRANTS FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ABSOLUTELY. PROSECUTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES. IS CONTEMPLATING- I WOULDN'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE. ON THIS- YOU KNOW. WE WOULDN'T BE TO. WORK OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER ABILITY THERE WOULD NEED TO BE PRESENT FOR- ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS- BUT I WOULD I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL ALSO CONTEMPLATES- INCREASED RESOURCES TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PROSECUTION OF THESE CRIMES AND THEN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW- LOCAL ENTITIES WOULD GET FUNDING. TO DO A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE REQUESTING INFORMATION AND DATA AND THAT'S BACK TO SENATOR CORTESE'S QUESTION AS WELL SO THINGS LIKE OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THIS GRANT- WE NEED REPORT- YOU KNOW QUARTERLY. DATA TO BE SUBMITTED ON. YEAH NUMBERS NEW OR- YOU KNOW THROUGH THESE. AND PROSECUTIONS CONVICTIONS ALL THOSE KINDS OF DATA ELEMENTS THAT WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS INTERESTED TO SEE THE FUNDING HAS GONE OUT AND HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TARGETED ON GOALS THAT MAKES SENSE TO BE ABLE TO BE. ASSESSED THAT MEASURE IN SOME MEANINGFUL WAY WHAT POSITIVE DIFFERENCE WAS MADE. OKAY AGAIN I DON'T SEE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN- HOW THE FUNDING PROVIDING THE FUNDING AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO FINDING I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T SEE HOW THE CORRELATION OF PROVIDING THE FUNDING. WILL ALLOW- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE FOR INSTANCE THE LADY WITH THE PICK AX OR THE GUY WHO COMMITTED THE SAME PROPERTY CRIME OR THEFT CRIME SIX TIMES IN ONE DAY WAS ARRESTED BUT WAS REQUIRED TO BE LET GO. UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN AND OTHER LOOK LAWS AND POLICIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING I'M I'M ASKING FOR A LIST I'D LEFT MY LIST BACK BACK AT THE OFFICE THAT HAS THE ENTIRE LIST OF ALL THE- SOFT ON CRIME POLICIES THAT HAVE GOT OUT OF THIS BUILDING. SO I JUST AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IN THIS IS MY QUESTION. FINDING THESE ORGANIZATIONS. HOW IS THAT GOING TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE THOSE ARRESTED. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FUNDING ISSUE IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WERE. I REPRESENT THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROSECUTE THEIR HANDS ARE JUST TIED. BECAUSE OF THE POOR POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING AND LIKE PROP FORTY SEVEN. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. HOW IS THIS FUNDING CAN ALLOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE TO VIOLATE PROP FORTY SEVEN OR THE POLICIES THAT ARE IN. EXISTENCE EIGHT. TWO ARE PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE FINDING. YEAH AGAIN KATIE HOWARD WITH THE BSE SEEING THERE IS A CRIME- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SO I THINK THAT'S THE AVENUE THAT WOULD BE- PERSON WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS GRANT. ON THE OTHER POLICY CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE I THINK FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS GRANT. HAPPY TO SEE IF MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN HAS ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS TO ADD ON THAT. YEAH JUST A MOMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST TO REITERATE WHAT MISS HOWARD SAID- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IS DEFINING PENAL CODE FORTY NINE. FOUR NINETY POINT FOUR- SO ANY OTHER CHANGES TO LAW WOULD MAKE IT. OUT I'M. FROM THE LIKES. AS FAR AS WHAT IS ON FOR DISTRICT. IN TO PROCESS. OKAY I GUESS I'M I'M NOT I'M I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY ABOUT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- WHERE YOU HAD EIGHTY PEOPLE SHOW UP SMASH AND GRAB WALK OUT WITH A THOUSAND DOLLAR OR SKEWS ME NINE HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS A PIECE SO THAT YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED. AM I GET THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CRIME THAT OCCURS EVERY SINGLE DAY- IF THIS IS JUST FOR ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. AM I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND THE FUNDING TO THE CHP AND OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFF. FOR TO HAVE A SPECIAL UNIT TO ADDRESSORGANIZED- CRIME RETAIL THEFT. I GUESS MY PART IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT- I HEAR FROM DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ALL OVER THE STATE THAT THEY CANNOT PROSECUTE. THESE CRIMES. BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN AND OTHER POLICIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING- SO I EAT. AGAIN HI I AM TRYING TO JUST TO FIND OUT HOW THE FUNDING IS GOING TO HELP- HOW THE FUNDING IS GOING TO HELP GET. HOW THE FINDING. OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT TRYING I'M- EXPLAINED IT ONCE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPLAIN IT A DIFFERENT WAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW. GIVING SOMEONE MORE MONEY REGARDLESS OF WHAT DEPARTMENT IT IS WILL HELP THEM PROSECUTE CRIMES THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PROSECUTE UNDER. IS I GUESS SHIN THIS IS KATIE HOWARD IN ON THEM FROM THE SEC I'M SORRY SURE YEAH I JUST. HOWEVER YOU CAN GIVE THE BEST ANSWER TO THE SENATOR BECAUSE AS SHE SAYS SHE'S ASKED THREE TIMES BUT WILL GIVE IT ONE LAST SHOT THANK YOU- AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S MORE TO THAT AND I GUESS THAT YOU KNOW THAT DIRECT QUESTION IS THAT HOW IS GIVING FUNDING TO WHATEVER ENTITY IT GOES TO WHETHER IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT DISTRICT ATTONEY'S OFFICE IT DOESN'T MATTER. HOW IS GIVING THEM ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND ALLOW THEM TO PROSECUTE AGAINST THE LAW THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS AND PROP A PROPOSITION THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. AND I THINK- THE ADMINISTRATION IS- IT IS FOCUSING ON THE CRIME OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WHICH IS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LANE IF YOU WELL. FROM OTHER KINDS OF FAST- AND OF COURSE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS- WELL I WOULD. RATHER NOT GET INTO ALL THE CHALLENGES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S FACE BUT IT IS IT IS CLEAR THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THERE'S A LOT. OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS GRANT GOES AFTER. DIRECTLY AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE ARE SIMPLY OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS GRANT. OKAY SO JUST AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION. FOR IS IT GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT QUESTION YES SO FOR- FOR INSTANCE- THE TRAIN ROBBERY I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT THE TRAIN ROBBERIES DOWN THERE WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S WORDS- WE'RE ALL THESE PACKAGES ARE STOLEN. IT'S JUST BASICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE IN PEOPLE YOU KNOW FROM THAT AREA NEIGHBORHOOD THAT COME DOWN ONE TRAIN SLOWS DOWN THEY JUMP OFF THE GROUND THE STAFF. IT'S NOT REALLY ORGANIZED CRIME BUT THEY CAN'T BE PROSECUTED SO IS THAT WILL THIS HELP. TYPE OF SITUATION. BUT JUST A MOMENT APART OF FINANCE I COULD JUST JUMP IN REALLY QUICK ORGANIZER THEFT. IS DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE IT IT IT DOES INCLUDE JUST ACTS IN CONCERT WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS TO STEAL MERCHANDISE. SO THAT CASE REQUEST IT'S NOT NECESSARILY LIKE SOME. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT CARTEL OR OR NECESSARILY HAVE. YOU KNOW A LARGE NETWORK OF FOLKS BEING INVOLVED IN THE CRIME ITSELF IT'S AS DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE- INVOLVING MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN RETAIL THEFT. TRAINING SAMPLE THAT YOU CITED GROVE WOULD BE INCLUDED POTENTIALLY. CAN CUT NINETY FOUR I'M SORRY TO SAY WOULD OR WOULDN'T IT COULD IT COULD IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PROSECUTION AND THE SPECIFICS OF THE CASE OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF EXPERTISE TO SAY BUT- THE PENAL CODE THAT DEFINES ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IS PRETTY BROAD IN THAT IT DEFINES YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF COLLECTIVE OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE- CRIME OF RETAIL THEFT BEING- PROSECUTABLE UNDER BACK IN OKAY. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SURE- AND ONE. COMMENT WITH ARE AMONGST OURSELVES RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS- AS FAR AS WHAT WAS IT THAT WHAT INFORMATION WHAT DATA THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE TO HAVE. TO DECIDE THAT ORGANIZE THIS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST OUR PRIORITY CRIME THIS YEAR FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- BECAUSE I THINK THAT KIND OF DATA THAT KIND OF INFORMATION REALLY SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR YOU KNOW A DECIDING THE TOTAL FUNDING LEVEL- HOW MUCH ADMINISTRATION WOULD. LIKE TO SEE. DISTRIBUTED TO MAYBE TO PUT AREAS I'M NOT SURE BUT THE DOZENS THEM AT LEAST I DIDN'T SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDE THIS WOULD BE THE HIGHEST CRIME PRIORITY CRIMES I COULD SEE WHY. IF YOU WATCH A LOT OF TV AND YOU SEE THE SAME CRIME ARE BEING SHOWN HUNDREDS OF TIMES OVER AND OVER THAT PICTURE OF THE- PACKAGES OUTSIDE OF THE TRAIN STATION WAS IN MY DISTRICT. THIS IS NOT A THIRD WORLD DISTRICT AND IT'S NOT A DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE JUST COME OUT AND START YOU KNOW STEALING- THAT'S NOT THAT WITH THAT COMMUNITY IS BUT YOU SAW IT ON THE TV HUNDREDS OF TIMES. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SO WHAT WHAT IS BEHIND THIS I GUESS AUG TWO JUST MAKE THAT PROPOSAL AND WHAT IS BEHIND THIS TOO- DECIDE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. AND HOW IT WOULD BASICALLY BE- DISTRIBUTED THROUGH GRANTS. ENGLAND RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW IT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE- CONCERNS OF THE LA- EXPRESSED I BELIEVE YOU JUST DID AS WELL AS FAR AS PRIORITIZING THE CRIME IS. IT MINISTRATION HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT FUNDS IN RECENT YEARS AND OTHER TYPES OF CRIMES AS MISSED OUR IT PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ON THE LAST PAGE IT AFTER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE CAL A BIT PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM- WE ALSO INVESTED YOU KNOW ELEVEN MILLION. FOR THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE TO FACILITATE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS IN TRAINING- BY THEIR INVESTMENTS AND KIND OF ANTI GUN AND CRIME PREVENTION IN OTHER AREAS. AS TO ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD FOR SEVERAL YEARS- THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO PRIORITIZED- THROUGH VARIOUS BILLS YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTING C. H. P.'S ORGANIZED CRIME RETAIL TASK FORCES IN THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THOSE- MY EXPANDING BESSIE T. TASK FORCES TO FRESNO AND SACRAMENTO AREAS AND KIND OF. TAKING ON A BROADER STATEWIDE APPROACH TO THE CRIME- AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS AND AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE NEWS- IT'S KIND OF BECOME. A AT ISSUE. GOTTEN SICK MORE PUBLISHED RECENT AND SOME THAT WE FROM WE- SIXTY. THAT IT'S A CONTINUING ON PROBLEM AND IT'S ONE THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING COMPLEXITY AND REQUIRES KIND OF A LARGER COLLABORATIVE APPROACH FROM STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- AS FAR AS THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS. NOT A SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE. FOR THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING TO KIND OF EXPAND THE CHP PROGRAMMING AND PROVIDE THESE GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S WITHIN THE OVERALL. OUR MOUNTAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR LANE THIS CONTRACT WOULD BE REALLY BENEFICIAL IN. COMBATING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IN CALIFORNIA. FROM. YES THE TASK FORCE- IS PROPOSED TO BE SITUATED WHERE IT IS SITUATED AT THE C. H. P. RATHER THAN AT D. O. J. HOW DOES THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY- FIT INTO THE CHP'S MISSION. AND THEN ALSO THERE IS I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE PARTIALLY ADDRESSED THIS IN TERMS OF STAFFING ISSUES OVER TIME ISSUES- HOW IS IT AND WHY DO THIS THROUGH THE C. H. P. RATHER THE DOJ. JUST A MOMENT SIR I CAN I CAN I GUESS FOR TED C. T. AS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INSIGHT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- EIGHTY TEN SIXTY FIVE AND EIGHTY THREE THREE ONE BUT ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED THEIR CRIME OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND- ON A TEMP. BASIS THE CP PROGRAMS- BUT ASFAR AS WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY GOING I WOULD PREFER. TO SEE PETE ON. THANK GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER CHATER READ. MY DAUGHTER IS HERE WITH ME THAT SHOULD BE THE ENGINE. TO TOUCH ON THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU WHEN THE LAW WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WE ASK YOURSELF THE SAME QUESTION WHAT IS THE HARD DRIVE TO BE WITH RETAIL THEFT BUT- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WAS A NEW CRIME. AND A LEGISLATOR ASKED US TO TAKE ON ESTABLISHING THE STATE TASK FORCE WHICH ARE NOT NEW TO US AND WE DO HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN RUNNING TASK FORCE BUT TODAY WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FOUR MEMBERS SERVING ON NINETY SEVEN DIFFERENT TASK FORCE. MANY OF WHICH WE TAKE THE LEAD ROLE ON. AND I JUST WANT TO BRAG A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT OUR FOCUS IS DONE WITH RETAIL THEFT SINCE. TWENTY NINETEEN- WE- IN OVERNIGHT OR AT RETAIL CRIME BUT DOLLARS IN STORE MERCHANDISE AND HAVE MADE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT. ARRESTS IN RESULTS THAT. I THINK IN OUR EXPERIENCE WE FOUND THAT- THAT'S THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK OUT THERE TO DO. THERE'S THE ABILITY TO EXPAND INTO OUR OUR VALLEY AND INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT REASON THAT- RUSSIAN ABOUT THE OVERTIME AND THE STAFFING- WE TALKED AOUT YESTERDAY WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT VACANCY ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND VACANCIES. ON THE OFFICER RANKS AND ARE ASKING IS THAT WE WOULD USE THIS FUNDING TO- USE OVER TIME TO KIND OF BRIDGE THAT GAP. BEFORE WE GET TO THE NEXT OF WINE AND THEN AS WE FILL THOSE VACANCIES WILL DEVOTE RESOURCES TOWARDS THESE GENES IN THOSE AREAS AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE LEVEL SERVICE- ABOUT IT NOW OTHER PART OF THIS ALSO GOES TO- SOME PORTION OF THIS WHAT IS IT TEN MILLION GOES TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN WHAT WAY IS THAT MONEY GOING TO BE USED WITH SMALL BUSINESSES. I JUST NEED ONE PARTNER FINANCE UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY HERE FROM THERE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. FOR BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS. DISCUSS THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS- THAT WOULD GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES FOR GRANTS- SOME FOURTEEN I CAN'T COMMENT ON THOSE. SPECIFIC. COMPONENT THIS PROPOSAL AT THE TIME AT THE TIME. OKAY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE ARE TARGETED WHAT IS IN THE CRITERIA THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE TARGETED TO- ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME AND NOT TO OFFSET OR INCREASE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BUDGETS. I'M JUST NAMING AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK JUST TO REITERATE WHAT MISS HOWARD SAID IN INTERNET MARKETING STRENUOUS POINTS HIS BAT IN MINISTRATION IS OPEN TO CONTINUING. NEGOTIATION ON THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO POTENTIALLY NARROWER KIND OF CLARIFY SOME ISSUES AND SO I THINK WE WOULD BE OPEN TO SPECIFY. YOU KNOW SUPPLANTING OF EXISTING FUNDING FOR THESE CRACKS. AND HOW. WILL YOU MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME RACIAL EQUITY. A PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE. ALL PATTERNS OF OVER POLICING OR- ISSUES OUT WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH THE PSPCL I'LL JUMP IN THERE- YEAH GRANT CRITERIA COULD SPECIFY GOALS LIKE THAT- AND PARTICULARLY WITH DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT- IF THERE IS. ANY ANY KIND OF PARAMETERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO. ADD ON YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY WITH- YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THEIR RESEARCH- AND GREEN MEANT THAT ISSUES OF RACIAL EQUITY SHOULD BE PAID ATTENTION TO AND THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY THOSE COULD BE BUILT RIGHT INTO THE GROUND CRITERIA. OKAY TONIGHT I WOULD SAY- ADD TO THAT- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBVIOUSLY I'VE I THINK THE- ESPECIALLY WITH THE TV AND THE MEDIA PROMOTE- YOU KNOW THERE'S SHOPLIFTING AND THEN THERE'S THE LARGER PICTURE OF- ORGANIZED CRIME CRIME RINGS. SO HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE HOW DO YOU GET INTO THAT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE. YES THIS IS KATIE HOW ARE YOU IT'S REALLY HAD A SIMILAR RESPONSE- ANY COMPETITIVE GRANT THAT GOES OUT WHAT. GENERALLY BEGINS WITH THE PROPOSAL NEEDING TO STATE THEIR PROBLEM AND HOW THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY PROPOSED TO UNDERTAKE WILL- ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA SO. IT REALLY WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ARE WHETHER IN THE AREAS OF FOCUS ARE NARROWED TO YOU KNOW SOME TYPE OF SCALE OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT OR WHAT HAVE YOU- YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A WAY FORWARD TO GRANT YOU BE SURE TO. SPECIFY WHAT IT'S GOING AFTER. RIGHT AND I. ASSUMING THE THERE'S- SUFFICIENT DATA IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH I THINK I WOULD COME BACK TO IS- I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE BASIS FOR THIS TYPE OF INVESTMENT WE HAVEN'T SEEN- REALLY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THIS KIND OF- A COMMITMENT FOR THIS VERY LARGE COMMITMENT OF FUNDING- WE HAVEN'T. SEEN WHY OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD MAKE THIS SUCH A PRIORITY AND INVEST IN SUCH A WAY BEFORE WE START GETTING INTO WHAT KINDS OF CONDITIONS WE WOULD PUT ON IT I JUST DON'T. SEE IT SO YOU WANT ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. JUST NAMING PARTNER FINANCE AGAIN I THINK WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT YOU KNOW OVERALL ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES CAN RESULT IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST. INCOME FOR RETAILERS AND ANY ACTIVITIES- AND PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN AND PROVIDING FLEXIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRAMM PRO GRAMS ARE TV ATTACHE FIND AS YOU KNOW IS MISS HOWARD IS SPECIFIED TO PROBATION APARTMENTS. FOR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS PERHAPS DIVERSION FOR NO JUVENILES OR- FOLKS WHO HAVE DRUG ADDICTIONS HE MIGHT BE PARTICIPATING IN THESE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES TO KIND OF ADDRESS BROADER ROOT PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO THESE CRIMES. SO AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE KIND OF FIT THE INNOVATION AND INTENT. OF THIS IN BEING A STATEWIDE EFFORT. OKAY AND I KNOW THERE WAS A- MIX THERE OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS RICK REGARDING- THEIR ABILITY OUR ABILITY TO PROSECUTE THEM IT IS ABSOLUTELY THERE. CAN AND I CAN ARREST AND CAN'T PROSECUTE SO. THERE IS THE SON. I BELIEVE A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT'S GOING AROUND THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN'T- A PROSECUTE AND- I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT. OKAY WE DO CARE OTHERS NO DOUBT THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE CARE ABOUT REDUCING CRIME AND THEFT- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS PACKAGE WILL TACKLE THE REAL PRESSING CRIME ISSUES IN THIS STATE. AND NOT GET CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT'S GOING ON ON TV- WE NEED UP I THINK A PLAN THAT'S MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL AND CLEAR AND HAS DATA BACKING IT UP. AND IT USES REAL- EVIDENCE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND IF WE NEED TO THEN WHAT'S THE CRITERIA SO WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY NUMBER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO- WITHOUT GETTING INTO IT WE COULD DO. Q. AND A WITH WANTED TO EXPOSE WHISPERS WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM CHP REGARDING THE FACT THAT MISDEMEANORS CAN STILL BE PROSECUTED ON PETTY THEFT OR INBOUND ON CRUTCHES- UNDER THE THRESHOLD THAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED. WHICH WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A YEAR IN JAIL SO IT'S NOT AS IF THERE ARE PENALTIES OUT THERE AND I JUST. DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE ALONE IN SAYING THAT I WANTED TO- CONFIRM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR OKAY- APPRECIATE THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM GRANTS- IS THAT YOU MISS HOUR. YES THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO KATIE HOWARD AGAIN. WE WOUND UP COVERING A VERY GOOD DEAL OF THE THINGS I HAD WANTED TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO. THE AGENDA QUESTIONS I THOUGHT THE AGENDA ON THE SIDE AND DID A VERY NICE JOB OF- LAYING OUT QUESTIONS ON THE GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS ON THERE ARE MIXED REVIEWS. GUN BUYBACK PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. LINE OF QUESTIONING ABOUT WHAT HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT IF WE UNDERTAKE THIS THAT IT WILL MEET- THE SHARED GOALS OF- YOU KNOW GETTING GUNS OFF THE STREET AND EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE. ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE SO. I DID SAY A LOT OF THESE THINGS BEFORE SO I WOULD JUST MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS THIS IS ALSO NOTED IN THE- ANALYSIS THAT THE- LA- HAS PUBLISHED. MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE GOALS OF A GUN BUYBACK PROGRAMS. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT I THINK AGAIN YOU KNOW AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN A JANUARY BUDGET. THE HIGH LEVEL- CONCEPTS ARE LAID OUT AND THEN THE DETAILS HAPPEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO WHAT SHOULD THE SPECIFIC GOALS INCLUDE AND THEN THE S. WHICH FLOW FROM THAT HOW THEN WOULD WE- PUT IN- WAYS TO MEASURE AND ASSESS. WHETHER WE MET THOSE GOALS- I WOULD HEARKEN BACK TO THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE PROCESS THAT I MENTIONED- THE BORDER STATING TO MEET ANY CORRECTIONS- BUILDS GRANTS BY USING- COMMITTEES THAT ARE. POPULATED BY PEOPLE WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE SO WE WOULD JUST. GO AFTER THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE OKAY WHAT WOULD A- HIGH QUALITY GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE AND THEN THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO SELL- THIS IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN. ONE TIME FUNDING SO YOU KNOW. MANY OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING THROUGH YOUR COMMITTEE AT NOT IT'S NOT A HUGE PROGRAM BUT CERTAINLY. ONE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES CAN MAKE AN IMPACT. SO I'M I'LL STOP THERE AND BE TO ANY. YOU MAY. OKAY THANK YOU WAS HOWARD- FROM THE LA- ON IS MISSILE. YES- ANY WITH THE LATEST PANEL OFFICE- AS WAS REFERENCED- I AM MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MILLS AT A REALLY GOOD JOB OF KIND OF SETTING UP OUR BROADER COMMENTS RELATED TO THE PACKAGE I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM AGAIN- I AM GOING TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON COMMENTS RELATED TO FIREARMS- AND SO AS REFERENCE TO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS PROGRAM WHICH- WE DID THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND OF GUN BUYBACKS CAN BE TARGETED TO ADDRESS. DIFFERENT PURPOSES SUCH AS TO REDUCE FIREARM SUICIDE OR TO REDUCE FIREARM CRIME RELATED VIOLENCE AND SO IF REDUCING FIREARM CRIME RELATED VIOLENCE IS THE GOAL RESEARCH DOES SUGGEST THAT SUCH PROGRAMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IF THEIR STRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR WAYS SUCH AS REQUIRING FIREARMS BE WORKING IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN INCENTIVE. PRIORITIZING THE TYPES OF FIREARMS THAT ARE USED IN CRIMES AND ARE FOCUSING ON THE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS ARE LOCATIONS ARE MORE PRONE TO FIREARM VIOLENCE- AND SO THOSE ADMITS HOWARD WAS REFERENCING MIGHT GET WORKED OUT AS PART. OF THE PROCESS BUT IT'S KIND OF UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED AND THESE ARE KEY THINGS THAT RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE IF YOU. ARE GOING TO DO A GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PRICE. PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS- AND IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- FIREARM RELATED GOALS AND SO DATA HAS INDICATED THAT THERE HS BEEN A GROWTH IN HOMICIDE FIREARM DEATHS. AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES. THAT INVOLVED FIREARMS- ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAD CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO THE STATE'S ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST. AS OF JAN AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THAT LIST. THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO- SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME PROHIBITED FROM OWNING OR POSSESSING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF FELONIES CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS- DOWN BY A COURT TO BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS OR HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THEM. AND RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT FIREARM. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ON THIS LIST- CAN. DECREASE IN THAT CRIME OR CERTAIN HOMICIDES. SO IN THE REPORT THAT WE RELEASED WHICH IS ALSO REFLECTED IN AN INNER JOHN THAT WE DO OFFER TWO OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. OTHER KIND OF GOALS AND SO THE FIRST IS LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL PLANS FOR DOJ'S GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROGRAM. WHERE FUNDING WAS PROVIDED TO COUNTY SHERIFFS TO REDUCE THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONALIZED- AS THE ASSISTANT DOJ AND KIND OF REMOVING THOSE FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO FURTHER REDUCE. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE LIST IT COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAMME AND MAKE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS CITY POLICE ALSO. ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANT. A SECOND OPTION IS ONE JUST. WANTS TO GO. OF THE LAST- AND THAT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. TO INSURE THAT FIRE ARMS ARE RELINQUISHED THE TIME INDIVIDUALS GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS AND- DEAN JUNE NO LONGER BE ABLE TO- POSSESS THEM. AND SO THAT WOULD BE THERE'S A PROCESS LAID OUT UNDER EXISTNG LAW SO THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IRMA. OKAY SEND A COURTESY ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I'M SORRY- I'M SORRY. OKAY FINANCE A SATURDAY I JUST MADE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I THINK JUST TO REITERATE WHAT MISS HOWARD SAID AS FAR AS THIS BEING KIND OF A GENERAL- IDEA ENTERTAINED ITEM FOR THE- RESTORATION IS THAT THE GOAL. BROADLY IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS NOT NECESSARILY THOSE SPECIFIC. INVOLVED IN CRIMES- YOU KNOW SUICIDES IN AND OTHER KIND OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS IN THIS SOCIETY IN SO. MANY MINISTRATION BELIEVE THAT FINDING THIS STATEWIDE EFFORT WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS BOTH THOSE THAT POTENTIALLY MAY HAVE BEEN OR POTENTIALLY COULD BE INVOLVED IN A CRIME BUT JUST DIDN'T JACK. THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS IN SOCIETY. IT IS IT WORTHWHILE EFFORT- WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY AS MISS WE NOTED INVESTED IN THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED. PERSONS SYSTEM- IN NINETEEN THE BUDGET PROVIDED SEVENTEEN FIVE MILLION ON GENERAL FUND TO IMPLEMENT- TEMPLE STERN SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM- INSTEAD AGAIN THE ATTENTION OF THIS IS. IS THE KIND OF COMMENT THE PROBLEM OF GUN VIOLENCE IN IT AND AT DIFFERENT CAPTAIN IN A BROADER STATEWIDE EFFORT TO JUST REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS AND PROVIDE KIND OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DANGERS. OF GUN OWNERSHIP IN GENERAL- AS WELL AS IN OUR OTHER BUDGET PROPOSALS- INCLUDING THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO. IMPLEMENT ANY KIND OF CONDUCT ADDITIONAL GUN RESEARCH WE THOUGHT THAT COMING AT THIS ISSUE FROM AS MANY ANGLES AS POSSIBLE. WOULD PRODUCE BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES. OKAY FROM MR CRITICIZING. THANK YOU VENTURE- HI I JUST WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS- WITH REGARD TO THE ITEM ONE IS I AGREE THAT- YOU KNOW POOR PROGRAM DESIGN IS CAN BE A PROBLEM OR AT A MINIMUM POOR PROGRAM DESIGN CAN CAN MAKE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF AFFECTED IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT OFTENTIMES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE REALLY TRYING TO TARGET. IN YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE. PRUDENT EVEN THOUGH I AM UNDERSTANDING THAT INTO THE ADMINISTRATION KIND OF WANT TO STAY AT. THIRTY THOUSAND FEET AND GOT THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FOR LATER. YOU KNOW BUT TO TALK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW IN THE BUDGET ITEM THE FACT THAT. THE DEAD THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE TIED TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- MY EXPERIENCE AND I'M I'M GUESSING THE SENATOR ALSO AND I NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT BASED ON HER BOOK HER BACKGROUND LOS ANGELES. A MINE IN PLACES LIKE HE SETTLES A- WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS WHEN WE TIED THEM. BUT TWO THINGS LIKE GANG ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES WHEN WE HAD. BUT YOUNG PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS- LIKE YOU'D SEE I'M IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES AND FOLKS LIKE THAT WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING OUT. HI- DOOR TO DOOR URGING PEOPLE TO GET RID OF UNWANTED GUNS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE. THEY'RE JUST WAY OVER REPRESENTED ON A PER HOUSEHOLD BASIS IN IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE IS A MORE SIGNIFICANT CRIME ELEMENTS- IN AN OFFICE HE CAN DO THE SAME THING AROUND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BY. BY VIRTUE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TWO THIRDS ON A REGULAR BASIS TWO THIRDS OF WHAT- BUT THE DESKTOP REPORTED BY OUR CORE CORNER PULLED ASIDE CLARA COUNTY MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH TWO THIRDS SOUL- YOU KNOW THE TICKET IT DOESN'T TAKE DON'T THINK TWO TO TIE. THESE BUDGET ITEMS TO THOSE KIND OF TARGETS THAT YOU WANT TO SEE THE LOCALS ACTUALLY. FOCUS ON BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING THAT IN TRYING TO SORT OF TAKE BACK. OR MAKE SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS- VERSUS JUST THE RETAIL OPERATION WHICH I'VE ALSO SEEN WHERE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING UNTIL TWO IN THE AFTERNOON ANYONE CAN DRIVE THROUGH. AND GET RID OF THEIR OLD HUNTING RIFLE FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS. HERE IN AND I'M JUST NOT SURE IT IN MOST CASES IT'S REALLY ACCOMPLISHING THE SAME KIND OF A GOAL SO. THOSE ARE THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ON THE INVESTMENT IT IT'S PROBABLY TO THE FINANCE SO. IT WAS A FINANCE OFFICE WHO SAID. IN SO MANY WORDS IT'S HARD TO MAKEA MISTAKE GETTING GUNS OFF THE STREET SO- PERHAPS THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TARGETED DEMOGRAPHICS WHEN YOU'RE GONE DOING THIS ONE IS A DEMOGRAPHIC SO WE REALLY MEAN GEOGRAPHIC SOMETIMES BUT I DO THINK AGAIN IT'S A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU DO SO. I COMMEND HER THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK YOU RAISE A REALLY POWERFUL POINT WHICH IS COMING COMING TO US AND REQUESTING MONEY FOR THE BUY BACK GUNS. DOESN'T ISN'T THE PICTURE THAT WE NEED A COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHAT'S GONNA TAKE PLACE THAT THIS IS A PART OF SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S A PART OF WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY BUT NOT JUST TELLING THE COMMUNITY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO A REALLY ENGAGING WITH THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO GETTING THOSE GUNS OFF THE STREETS- IT'S NOT THE SAME AS YOU KNOW DOING A QUOTE UNQUOTE PUBLIC AWARENESS. OF OUR KIND OF CAMPAIGN THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS HAVING- COMMUNITY LEADERS. TELL US HOW TO ADDRESS IT AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT WORK FOR US THERE SO I THINK THAT'S THE FOR ME AND I APPRECIATE SENATOR CORTEZ THESE COMMENTS IS UP WE'RE LOOKING FOR A REAL SOLUTION NOT JUST THE PIECEMEAL. HERE AND THERE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES- SO MUCH MONEY- AND WE KNOW THAT BY THEMSELVES YOU KNOW THESE BUY BACK PROGRAMS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE- AND- YEAH WE WILL TRY A LOT OF THINGS BUT- AFTER A WHILE THIS IS BEEN GOING ON THE COMMUNITIES FOR. MANY YEARS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS KNOW. WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK. SO WITH THAT APPRECIATE- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH- WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUES THREE. FIREARMS TRACKING AND DATA SYSTEMS AND I BELIEVE THE DOJ'S OFFICE. IS THAT MISS HARPER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ASHLEY HART BUDGET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THE FIREARMS PROPOSALS OUTLINED IN THIS AGENDA ITEM SEEK THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN THE MANDATES OF THREE LEGISLATIVE BILLS SB SEVEN FIFTEEN. AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE AND EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE ADDITIONALLY DOJ REQUEST RESOURCES TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT FIRE ARMS IT MODERNIZATION EFFORT WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR A LONG TERM MODERN IT SOLUTION TO MEET EXISTING BUSINESS NEEDS AND TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE STATUTORY MANDATES IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. I AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU WHEN THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ON THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MARK FURMAN. YOU OKAY AND OF THE LA- ANY DELAY AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS OF THE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. OKAY FOR THE COURTESY AND THE REMARKS ON THIS ISSUE THOUGH THIS WAS PRETTY CLEAR FOR ME THANK OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU. SHARE THAT WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE CAN MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE FOR WHICH IS OUR TASK FORCE ON A PROGRAM. AND WE'LL HAVE THE DOJ START OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ASHLEY HARP AGAIN BUDGET OFFICER AT DOJ- DOJ REQUESTS AN INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND I'M GOING TO MAINTAIN DOJ OVERSIGHT AND PARTICIPATION IN COLLABORATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TASK FORCE'S STATEWIDE AT THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT THE CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN EIGHT TASK FORCES WHICH ACT AS COLLABORATIVE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERSHIPS BY UTILIZING PERSONNEL FROM VARIOUS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO FORM TEAMS TO CONDUCT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT AIDING AGENCIES IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY EFFORTS. AT THIS REQUEST SEEKS THE STATE SHARE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPATING IN A TASK FORCES WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PERMANENT COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THESE COMPLEX MULTI JURISDICTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BOTH REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE BENEFITS. I WITHOUT WELCOME QUESTION- FROM YOURSELF OR THE COMMITTEE ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. OKAY WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF NC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PART OF MY HANDS NO COMMENTS THANK YOU. OKAY AND- MISLI THE LA OFFICE. S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER O'NEILL MENTIONS- THIS IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE EVALUATED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN- WE DID IN OUR REVIEW- I RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING MASS AS IT WOULD MAINTAIN DOJ'S PARTICIPATION OF TASK FORCES TO DEAL WITH THESE COMPLEX AND MULTI JURISDICTIONAL. INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD HAVE BOTH STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL REGIONAL BENEFITS THIS IS REALLY BECAUSE EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES IS PAYING FOR THE COSTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING- AND THIS REALLY PROVIDES INCENTIVE TO ENSURE THAT EACH TASK FORCE IS FOCUSING ON INVESTIGATING THOSE CRIMES THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ALL OF THE PARTICIPATING MEMBERS WHICH ARE GENERALLY THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST PRESSING ENTER THE MOST COMPLEX. AND CERTAINLY WITH THAT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR HIGHEST PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE- THINGS LIKE RETAIL FAST OR YOU KNOW PARTICULAR INCREASES IN CRIME- OUTSIDE OF RETAILFAST. AND SO SOME OF THAT MIGHT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT THAT'S A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THAT INEQUITY IT COULD ACTUALLY EVEN CONSIDER EXPANDING. THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY OPERATE REGIONALLY AND SO WHAT YOU COULD GET- IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE FOR SOME PARTICIPANTS WORKING TOGETHER- POOLING THEIR RESOURCES AND MAKING USE OF THAT PARTICULAR SKILL SETS THAT EACH OF THEM HAVE. AND SO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD ALSO HAVE INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF THOSE CRIMES BEING INVESTIGATED ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THE STATE ALSO BENEFITS BECAUSE THE STATE'S NOT BEARING THE FULL COST. OF KIND OF DEALING WITH THAT AND SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS. AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY- C. OKAY MONSON OCCURRED HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FILE FOR THE DOJ'S OFFICE IS- HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH TASK FORCES TO PARTICIPATE AND- AND OUR- FOR THEIR NEW OR ADDITIONAL TASK FORCES ARE REGIONS THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED- AND ALSO. WHEN AND HOW DO YOU DECIDE THAT IT'S- NO LONGER NEEDED TO HAVE A TASK FORCE HOW ODD IS THAT DECISION MADE MADE- GET MADE I NOTICED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE TASK FORCES AT SOME GO BACK AS FAR AS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE NINETEEN NINETY ONE. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FOR VERY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS SO. FIRST OF ALL JUST MAKING THE DECISION THAT HAVE A TASK FORCE I THINK THAT'S I MEAN HAVING THE TASK FORCE I'M SURE HOW IS A GOOD THING. TO HAVE THAT COORDINATION BUT- OF- HOW DO YOU STARTED IN. HOW DO YOU ENDED WHEN DO YOU AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF MADAM CHAIR I HAVE JOHN MARSH WHO IS OUR CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO THOSE QUESTIONS. SURE THANK YOU. FOR THAT QUESTION- STARTING- WE WORK WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND IDENTIFY. ISSUES IN LOCAL AREAS AND- KIND OF MEL THE TASK FORCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DATES OF STARTING UP THE DIFFERENT TASK FORCES. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT A MONTH. FIFTY NINE STATEWIDE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T GET TO MAKE THE DECISION- I'M CLOSING THEM IT WAS A FUNDING ISSUE AND OF THE STATE CUT OUR BUDGET AND WE HAD TO CLOSE UP FORTY OR AT THE TIME THIRTY FIVE TASK FORCES THE MOST. TESTING RIGHT NOW- AS YOU YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TASK FORCE'S ALLEY IMPACT IS THE LARGEST- TASK FORCE IN THE NATION COVERS THE ENTIRE- LOS ANGELES AREA. WITH FORTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES PARTICIPATING AT- TO A LOCAL- TASK FORCE- IMPOSTER COUNTY. AND THAT HAS SIX PARTICIPATING AGENCIES ON IT BUT THEY SERVE- THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY IN THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE AND IT'S A FORCE MULTIPLIER. EACH PASSWORD HAS EACH TASK FORCE HAS A BOARD. AND THE BOARD- COMES TOGETHERNESS- POLICE CHIEFS AND SHARP SCENT. WE COME UP WITH WHAT ARE THE PRESSING ISSUES AND FOCUS ON THOSE ISSUES IN THEIR AREA- TO PROVIDE- EXPERT- INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE- THE PART THE DOJ COMES AND WE HAVE STATE WIDE CONNECTIVITY. SO OUR TASK FORCES ARE CONNECTED A STATEWIDE AND ALSO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES OF DOJ'S SO FOR THE INSTANCE THAT I GIVE UP IMPOSTER- THEY HAVE A CASE WHERE. YOU KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CONNECT TO THEM EITHER WITH OUR FIELD OFFICES FOR OUR TASK FORCES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- TO EVEN- BOLSTER- THEIR INVESTIGATIVE CAPACITY. SO OTHER QUESTION ABOUT EXPANDING TASK FORCES WE WOULD LOVE TO- EXPAND OUR TASK FORCE CAPACITY AND THAT WOULD BE- AN AREA BY AREA WE WORK WITH LOCAL SHERIFFS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS- JUST SEE. A LEVEL OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN AREAS. SO JUST AS A FOLLOW UP TO WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED- THE EXPANSION OF OUR VIEW. OF. I'M SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT HOW WOULD YOU GO FORWARD IN- HUSSEIN STATEWIDE UP HERE'S THE STRATEGY STATEWIDE THIS IS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BUY IN AND ON THE ON THE SUPPORT AND THE MOTIVATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT HOW DO YOU LOOK AT ME LOOK AT THIS OR HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THIS IN A MORE STRATEGIC- STATEWIDE- BASIS. YEAH HI TESSA QUESTIONS SO- THAT'S WHAT DOJ DOES WELL IS CONNECTING STATE- BUT BUT THE NEW ONES THAT MAKES THESE TASK FORCES SO SUCCESSFUL. IS THEY ARE INDEPENDENT- DOJ COMES IN IT CONNECTS THE TASK FORCE'S TOGETHER BUT EACH TASK FORCE WORKS INDEPENDENTLY. ON INDEPENDENT ISSUES WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO IT IT REALLY IS A- COMMUNITY BASED TYPE ENFORCEMENT. ACTION SO AT ONE TIME MOST OF OUR TASK FORCES WERE NOT PRODUCT BASED AND AS THE TRENDS OF A NARCOTIC ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT SHIFT. THEN THE TASK FORCE'S SHIFTED THEIR FOCUS AT MOST OF OUR TASK FORCES ARE SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAMS AND THEY THEY FOCUSED ON WHATEVER THE COMMUNITY ISSUE IS AND BRING- INVESTIGATIVE EXPERIENCE- TO THAT AREA. OKAY ALL RIGHT WHAT THE PRE SHAPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR RESPONSES- AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE OF WHICH IS COVERS VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IF YOU WOULD PRESENT. I THINK YOU KNOW- ACTUALLY HEART BUDGET OFFICER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- UNDER THIS AGENDA ITEM DOJ REQUEST RESOURCE AS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE MANDATED WORKLOADS OF TWELVE LEGISLATIVE BELLS. RESOURCE AS WELL ALLOW DOJ TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN WORK LOAD AND THAT'S DRIVEN BY THESE BILLS- THERE ARE A TOTAL OF THREE PROPOSALS THAT ARE TE RESULT OF LEGISLATION PASSED IN PREVIOUS SESSIONS AND- THE REMAINING THE REMAINING PROPOSALS ARE THE RESULT OF LEGISLATION. THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED AND WE WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT. YOU OR THE COMMITTEE HAVE ON THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE DEPARTMENT FINANCE COMMENT PLEASE. A FORMER FINANCE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND- LA O'S OFFICE PLEASE. I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IF THEY HAVE NO CONCERNS- RELATED TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY AND THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CLICK TO SUBSCRIBE TO SEE THE PASS LEGISLATION BEING FUNDED. THAT'S IT. HAVE BEEN FLAGGED BY THE SAME THING TO EFFECTIVELY RIGHT. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE SIX. THE SPECIAL FUND. A SPECIAL FUND CONDITIONS AND- GO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS HARP. HI ASHLEY HARP D. O. J. UNDER THIS AGENDA ITEM DOJ REQUEST AT TWO THINGS ONE IS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IF NEEDED TO THE AMMUNITION ST DAN FORSMAN SPECIAL FUND WHICH SUPPORTS THE DOJ'S AMMUNITION PURCHASED AUTHORIZATION PROGRAM. DUE TO INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO THE FIND AND NUMBER TWO REQUEST A GENERAL FUND BACK FILL OF THE DNA ID FIND OF FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ON A ONE TIME BASIS WHICH SUPPORTS DOJ'S BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES AND PROVISIONAL ENGLISH FOR ADDITIONAL GENERAL GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IF NEEDED- I'M AVAILABLE AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES AND- THE- GIRLFRIENDS EX. SERVICES AND THAT- OUR ARMS TO DRESSING THAT YOU HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. MARTIN IS A COMMON FINANCE WITH REGARDS TO INDIANS BECAUSE OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE THE AMMUNITION TRANSACTION WE JUST FELT THAT WE USE FOR- THE AMMUNITION- FINE HAVE BEEN BALL TILE AND HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A BASELINE PATTERNS SO DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. THE STRUCTURE AT THIS TIME ALSO YOU KNOW BE THE THOUGHT IS THAT PROVIDING ON THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO BACKFILL PLAN WOULD ALLOW- S. ALLOW DOJ TO MAINTAIN CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS- AS WE DETERMINED. NOT REQUIRING SOLUTION. I THANK YOU MISLI. HE MANAGED CARE- WE DO HAVE COMMENTS FOR YOU ON BOTH SPECIAL PLANS FOR YOU IS THE FIRST ONE FOCUSED ON THE AMMUNITION SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT FRIENDS- WE FIRST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ANY GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO THIS SPECIAL PLANNED AS A LOAN SH AND THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR START AT ONE THAT WAS AUTHORIZED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. BY PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE AND ASK ME TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WHICH ALSO CREATED THAT'S FINE- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD BE NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THE AMMUNITION PURCHASE AUTHORIZATION PROGRAM SERVICE LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION- IS WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHANGE STATE LAW TO INCREASE THE AMMUNITION PURCHASE TRANSACTION FEE. THIS IS EXACTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY ONE DOLLAR. PER TRANSACTION- THE INTENSIVE PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE AND ACTUALLY TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WAS FOR FEE REVENUES TO COVER THE STATE'S REASONABLE REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT COSTS. RELATED TO AMMUNITION PURCHASES AND SO- IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURE BEFORE YOU ON PAGE TWENTY SIX- A FEE INCREASE WILL BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE FINES- OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL WHICH HAS EXISTED SINCE THE FUND. HAS BEEN CREATED AS WELL AS TO START REPAYING THAT GENERAL PLAN START UP WELL. WE WOULDN'T KOW THAT IF THE INCREASE WOULD REQUIRE. A 55% APPROVAL BY EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE. WHEN THINKING ABOUT THAT FEE INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE HAS VARIOUS OPTIONS THAT THEY COULD CONSIDER. SUCH AS- AND- AS ARE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE MAXIMUM PER TRANSACTION FEES DESIRED HOW QUICKLY THEY WANT THE GENERAL PLANS START AT ONCE TO BE REPAID. AND WHEN THE DESIRE TO SEE INCREASED SHOULD TAKE A FACT. SO FOR EXAMPLE- ASSUMING LITTLE CHANGING PURCHASER BEHAVIOR- INCREASING THE FEE BY TWO DOLLARS SO FOR A TOTAL THREE DOLLARS EACH THAT COULD BASICALLY HELP ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL WAS ADDRESSED AND DEAL WITH KIND OF MINOR CHANGES IN REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. AN ADDITIONAL ONE DOLLAR INCREASE FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR DOLLAR FEET THAT COULD ACTUALLY GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO RETAIN THE GENERAL FUND LONG WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE WAIT. RELATED THE DNA I DON'T. FINDS WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT- WE WOULD NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE STATE'S SPECIAL PLANS THAT IS IMPACTED BY DECLINING COLONEL FINANCE DEPARTMENT. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IN PRIOR EXPERIENCES WE JUST WANTED TO FIND. OUT SO FIRST WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PORSCHE PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AM PROVIDE DOJ WITH DIRECTION ON HOW MUCH OF ITS OPERATIONS SHOULD COME FROM LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS LIKE ONE THIRD OR ONE HALF. AND THIS COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE BFS COST ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IN THE AGENDA BEFORE YOU ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN YOU HAVE A GOOD CHART SHOWS BASICALLY THE GENERAL PLAN BACK FILL THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. IN RECENT YEARS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S KIND OF INCREASING- WOULD ALSO THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE MORE EQUITABLE THAN THE EXISTING SYSTEM IN WHICH CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AT NO CHARGE WHILE OTHERS ARE PAYING TO OPERATE THEIR OWN LABORATORIES. AND SO WITH AGENCIES THAT THEN RECEIVE SERVICES BEING REQUIRED TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A GREATER INCENTIVE FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE. THE WORK OF THAT THEY'RE SENDING TO DOJ AS WELL. D. O. J. WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND CALCULATING EACH LOCAL AGENCIES SHARE TO DEAL WITH EQUITY ISSUES AND OTHER CONCERNS. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW HAVING AGENCIES CAME MORE OR LESS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF FORENSIC SERVICES SOUGHT. THE SPEED OF THE SERVICE OR THE SIZE OF THE AGENCY. THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE WOULD PROVIDE TIME FOR FOLKS TO ADAPT TO THE NEW FUNDING STRUCTURE AND ALLOW FOR IT TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IN LINE WITH THIS OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- IS REQUIRING DOJ REPORT- BY MARCH ON- OPTIONS OTHER THAN THE GENERAL PLAN TO SUPPORT BE A FAST AND ONE OF THE OPTIONS WAS TO INCLUDE- WIND RELATED TO SHARING COSTS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND THAT. INFORMATION COULD THEN BE USED TO INFORM THIS NEW FUNDING STRUCTURE. THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL. JUST FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TO ENSURE THAT SERVICE LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED WHILE THIS NEW FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT WE RECOMMEND- IT IS IMPLEMENTED AND ALLOW FOR DOJ AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENTS TO ADAPT TO THE NEW. STRUCTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH THE L. A MAN- EITHER THE DOJ OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S. LONG TERM PLAN FOR DEALING WITH THESE INSOLVENCY ISSUES. IN BOTH FUNDS. OUR MARKET AS A PERMANENT FINANCE TOM YOU KNOW CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE CONDITIONS OF THE FINES AND- AS- B. ELLIE I'VE NOTED- THE- DOJ WILL BE- PUBLISHING IT ON MARCH REPORT ON DNA ID FIND AND OPTIONS I MEAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING- YOU HAVE APARTMENT. WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE- AND AS FAR AS B. B. B. I MEAN THEY'RE SAYING THAT- SPECIAL FINE. YEAH IT'S REALLY HARD TO. SAY- YOU KNOWREALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE ONGOING SOLUTION IS UNTIL WE REALLY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF ME- B. B. S. THE REVENUE BASELINE IT'S REALLY IT IT'S QUITE VOLATILE ON IT AND IF ANYTHING IT'S AN INCREASING TREND GOING TO END. WITH IS THERE THERE CERTAINLY ARE OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT ARE OURS POSSIBLY A PLAY AND SO YOU. KNOW THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE ARE. THE TWO MONITORS SHORT. NOTES WERE WORSE MONITOR THE BOTH FINES AND WE LOOK TO BY THANK YOU THROUGH AN OFFERING OPTION FOR ITS ON GOING. THANK YOU.

THIS IS JUST A GENERAL QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYONE ON ANSWER THIS ONE- IT'S- OF COURSE IN DIRECTLY RELATED TO IT- THE BUDGET REQUEST ITSELF BUT ON THE AMMUNITION SAFETY ENFORCES SPECIAL FUND- PHARMACY THE STATE OPERATED. FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT SUCH A FUND IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T KNOW THE GRAPHING HERE GOES BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS- ORIGINALLY LEGISLATED INTO EXISTENCE BUT- HAS THERE BEEN ANY SEPARATE AND APART FROM JUSTICE FOR ACTUATING. THE PROBLEM WITH- WITH COST RECOVERY IS SERBIAN ANY AUDIT OR STUDY OF THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS- THE DATE I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION IS IF AFFECTED MOSTLY CONSUMER WAS. INTENDED THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS TO KEEP. THE WRONG PEOPLE FROM GETTING AMMUNITION IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT- IF IT MADE IT MAY MAKE SOME SENSE OF SOMETHING FOR US TO HAVE A FEEL FOR WHETHER OR NOT TO PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORKING. I WOULD LIKE TO WITH TWO DAYS OF THIS. HI I THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION- THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM- THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS A RESULT OF PROP SIXTY THREE AND A TWELVE THIRTY FIVE- DO YOU THIS WORKLOAD WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY TRACT- SO EARLIER ESTIMATES WERE SIMPLY- BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE TRANSACTIONS WOULD BE- NOW THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR SEVERAL YEARS- WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND REVENUES HAVE BEEN. ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- THE OPERATIONAL COSTS ARE SIMPLY EXCEEDING THE ONE DOLLAR FEE REVENUES THAT ARE COMING IN- AND A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE EXISTS TO SUPPORT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE ALLEY- AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR AN ONGOING SOLUTION FOR THIS PROGRAM- PRECIADO MISS HARPER AND I AND I'M NOT. I'M I'M BUYING IN COMPLETELY INTO THE IDEA THAT- IT'S BEEN HARD TO. FIGURE OUT THE REVENUE TREND HERE VERSUS EXPENSES- I GUESS I WAS ASKING KIND OF A LARGER QUESTION WHICH WOULD. REQUIRE WORK BY THE LA- OR SOME SORT OF SOME SORT OF ANALYSIS OR AUDIT WHICH IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WORTH OF CRIME PREVENTION ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE PROGRAM- IN A IN A DO UNDERSTAND. THE GENESIS OF PROGRAM WASN'T. HI DOJ- HAS YOU JUST EXPLAINED- YEAH GOOD. HI I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM MUCH OF MUCH LIKE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMS EARLIER TODAY SO I THANK YOU FOR. YOUR ANSWER THOUGH AND- I CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT. OFFLINE AS SIMPLY. SHOOT. WELL MAYBE- THE DOJ'S OFFICE CAN. OFFER SOME IS THERE ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN THE PAST- RESPONDING TO SENATOR CORTESE'S OFFICE MISS HARPER. WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED A STUDY OF THE PROGRAM AS OF RIGHT NOW BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO WORKING WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE I'M SURE TO STUDY BE PURSUED.

TO ADDRESS THESE EVENTS- THE BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY- AS AS THEY'VE COME OUT OF US- SO TODAY- THE FIRST GALLO YES AGAIN THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A BUNDLE OF PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN OUR PREPAREDNESS PREVENTION CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY CAPABILITIES FROM ALL HAZARDS. DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES IT'S ALL JUST RUN THROUGH THESE THESE BUNDLES QUICKLY AND THEN- WHAT HAD HAPPENED ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS ABOUT STRENGTHENING OUR REGIONAL RESPONSE THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION- AND TWENTY POSITIONS TO EXPAND CAL- YES IS REGIONAL RESPONSE CAPACITY AND STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS IN ENGAGEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STAKEHOLDERS. THESE PROFESSIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL ARE THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES TEAMS CITY AND COUNTY LEADERSHIP CBO'S NGOS FAITH BASED GROUPS EXCEPT FOR US AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS- GIVEN THE SCOPE. GAIL AND COMPLY OF THIS TODAY THERE IS A CRITICAL TO X. THESE REGIONAL. PERSONNEL TO MEET THE NEEDS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE OFTEN OVERLAPPING NATURE OF DISASTERS THAT WE ARE SEEING EXPANDING GEOGRAPHICALLY BROADLY ACROSS. MOST OF TIME MULTIPLE REGIONS OF THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME. SOTHAT'S THE FIRST ONE IN THE BUNDLE THE SECOND IS- IMPLEMENTING- ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE EIGHTY. DISCOVERY REQUESTS IS UP A BUDGET PROPOSAL OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AND SIX POSITIONS TO COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY REVIEW COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH.

THE THIRD IS- INCREASING SUPPORT CAPACITY- THE BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SPECIAL FUNDS. FOR SEVENTY ONE POSITIONS TO INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS REALLY A TRUE UP OF CRITICAL AND NECESSARY POSITIONS THAT PROVIDE CAPACITY CONTINUITY AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ACROSS THE AGENCY THESE POSITIONS INCLUDE SPECIALISTS IN OUR FINANCIAL OPERATIONS A LOT OF TEEN LEGAL OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS. S. RESPONSE SUPPORT SECTIONS OVER THE YEARS AS A DEPARTMENT AND ITS RESPONSIBILITY HAVE EXPANDED AND AS SUCH SO HAS THAT TREMENDOUS WORK LOAD AT A REQUIREMENT AT ALL OF THESE AREAS FOR THE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS AND THE LAST IN THIS BUNDLE IS ADDRESSING LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT WORKLOAD. THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FINE AND TWENTY ONE POSITIONS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY FOR OUR DISASTER LOGISTICS AND PLANNING BRANCH. CHANGE COORDINATES AND EXECUTES LOGISTICS AND MAJOR INCIDENTS EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS SUCH AS BUILDING AND SUPPORTING OPERATIONAL STAGING AREAS AND BASE CAMPS AND MANAGING AND COORDINATING AND FACILITATING THE DELIVERY OF. E. P. ACROSS THE STATE. N. OR ESTABLISHING VACCINATION OR TESTING SITES WHAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THESE FOLKS HAVE DONE NOW SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS B. DISASTER LOGISTICS SECTION. HAS BEEN A CRITICAL RESOURCE CAPABILITY AT ALL HAS ADVANCED FROM WILDFIRES EARTHQUAKES THE POP THE PUBLIC HEALTH EVENTS HELLO YES IS INCREASING INCREDIBLY BUSY BUT THIS ABSOLUTE JUST SIX UNIT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BUSIEST AREAS THAT WE'VE SEEN. IN THE AGENCY SO WHAT WITH THAT- MANAGER ALL. STOP AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WE MOVE ON TO FIND FOR YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE. THE AFTERNOON STEVEN BANKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I NOTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD TO THE PRESENTATION THAT CAL YES MAN BUT AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AS NEEDED OFFICE PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DREW SUPPORT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BEFORE I PROVIDE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY I WANT TO PROVIDE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO THE- YES BUDGET SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING THE STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. AND REQUIRE A REVIEW OF THE- YES BASE BUDGET IN LIGHT PLAN WE FIND THIS TO BE NECESSARY FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT REASONS TO BEGIN WITH THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF EMERGENCY USE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS AND- IN ADDITION TO THIS THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE TO THINK THAT THIS INCREASED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES WILL PROCESS AND IN THE FUTURE. IN RESPONSE AS SHOWN IN THE CHART ON PAGE THIRTY THREE THE GENDER OF THE STATE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY AUGMENTED THE ARIANESPACE BUDGET FROM TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND 201-718-2400 AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO APPROVE ALL OF THE GOVERNORS OPERATIONS. GREASE FIRE DIVISIONAL FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OR 9% INCREASE ON WHAT WE FIND THAT IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO PROPOSE TO INCREASE THE STATE'S RESPONSE CAPACITY FURTHER IT'S DIFFICULT AT THIS TIME TO ASSESS WHETHER THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS BEING PRESENTED TODAY REFLECT THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR DOING SO BECAUSE THE PROPOSALS DON'T APPEAR TO BE TIED TO SPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSABLES AND JACKETS. IN VIEW OF THIS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION. TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THIS PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE. GOALS FOR THE LEVEL OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY THE STATE NEEDS TO MAINTAIN AND CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR MEETING THESE GOALS ASSESSMENT OF EXISTING EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. IDENTIFICATIONS OF GAPS OR WEAKNESSES IN CURRENT RESPONSE CAPACITY THAT PREVENT THE STATE FROM MEETING ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSABLES AND ASSESSMENT OF THE LEVEL OF STAFFING NECESSARY TO SUPPORT BASE WORKLOAD AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY GOALS. AND A PLAN FOR OBTAINING. THE NEEDED STAFFING. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE- YES BASED BUDGET BE REVIEWED. IN THE LIGHT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S EXISTING RESOURCES ARE MEETING THE STATE'S STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS WHETHER THERE ARE SOME RESOURCES THAT COULD BE REALLOCATED TO HIGHER PRIORITY USES. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE REASON AUGMENTATIONS PROVIDED SO YES I'VE ALREADY PROVIDED THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GOALS. BOMB WE WOULD KNOW BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUEST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JURY OUT THIS REVIEW AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A UNIT DEDICATED TO THIS TYPE OF WORK. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT WERE PRESENTED ARE WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON EACH OF THEM. FIRST WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CHAPTER SEVENTY SEVEN FORTY FOUR OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S EIGHTY FIFTY EIGHT. PART FIVE EIGHTY EXCUSE ME. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE REVIEW OF JOHNNY WORKING . PLANS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. OBVIOUSLY THE WORK WILL BE STATUTORILY REQUIRED AND IN ADDITION THE REVIEW- THE COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CAN HELP INFORM OH YES OF WHAT LOCAL CAPACITIES ARE TO ASSIST THESE INDIVIDUALS WHICH COULD IN TURN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE- RECOMMEND. IN ADDITION- WE FIND THAT THE REMAINING THREE PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT CAPACITY PROPOSAL THE REGIONAL RESPONSE PROPOSAL AND A LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AN ABSENCE OF A STRATEGIC PLAN. ON THE BASELINE BUDGET REVIEW FOR EXAMPLE THE SUPPORT CAPACITY PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STAFFING FOR MULTIPLE- YES SOME GYMS I'VE RECEIVED AUGMENTATIONS IN RECENT YEARS WITHOUT A STRATEGIC PLAN ANYBODY'S BUDGET REVIEW IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THE RESOURCES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED WERE INSUFFICIENT WHAT THE TOTAL LEVEL- YES RESOURCE NEED IS. ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THESE GROUP BUT DURING SO ON A YEAR TERM BASIS THAT WOULD PROVIDE RESOURCES WHILE THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND- BASED BUDGET REVIEW WERE BEING COMPLETED AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE COMPLETED. THEIR PROPOSALS COULD BE REASSESSED WITH THE BENEFIT INFORMATION FROM THOSE OVER ARCHING ASSESSMENTS I'M NOT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SITE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HELLO SENATOR KERRY ROOM BUT IF I NO- YES I'D LIKE TO ASK IF- DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE L. A. O.'S- COMMENTS- I DO THINK THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE OF- HOW DO WE ENGAGE OUR HOW DO YOU ENGAGE IN STRATEGIC PLANNING- AND COME UP WITH IS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE STAFFING LEVELS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AS AS YOU WERE SOMEONE SAID THIS IS INCREASED EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS IT'S THE NEW NORMAL SO. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ELIO. THANKS MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND- WELL FIRST OF ALL- BRIDGET B. LA- RECOMMENDING THAT YOU APPROVE FUNDING FOR THESE REQUESTS- OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD ALTHOUGH- I THINK THAT- AND I APPRECIATE THE LA- A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHALLENGES FACING THE ORGANIZATION. AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. OUR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT- YES IT IS I GUESS THE WEIGHT THE BEST DESCRIBE IT. IS MUCH LIKE A CITY GOVERNMENT IT'S A UNIQUE ORGANIZATION STATE GOVERNMENT- WE ARE A WE HAVE A JOB AND AN EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OUR CITY MANAGEMENT. WE'VE GOT OUR FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT WE HAVE OUR HIGHLY PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENTS ARE PLANNING AND- PLANNING DIVISION DEPARTMENT ALL OF THESE ARE. OUR FUNCTIONS- THAT- HAVE THEIR OWN VERTICALS NOW THE CROSSOVER COORDINATE WITH EACH OTHER- TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER THE PROGRAMS BY WHICH WE NEED TO IN SUPPORT OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA DURING. WHETHER WE'RE IN PLANNING OR PREPARED THIS PHASE OR WERE ACTUALLY RESPONDING ALL THE WAY THROUGH RECOVERY WHEN WE SEE THESE DEVASTATING. DISASTERS THAT LITERALLY IN MANY CASES NOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE LITERALLY WIPED OUT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HI AND IT TAKES A VICTORY TAKES UP THE WHOLE CITY IN THIS CASE TAKES ON A WHOLE- YES- ED TO COME TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY. RESPOND AND RECOVER TO THESE EVENTS SO IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN WE HAVE ASKED FOR RESOURCES WE HAVE BUILT THOSE RESOURCE REQUEST AROUND THE NEEDS. AT THE TIME AS THE EMERGENCIES THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH AND THEY WERE. FOCUSED IN THESE VERTICALS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AS B. DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES INCREASING COMPLEXITY AND SPEED AND SCALE AND SCOPE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOW ASKING AND REQUESTING ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN THE AREAS THAT- HOW DIFFERENT ROLES OR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ARE STILL NONETHELESS UNDER- YES I GUESS THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. WE ARE NOT SORT OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL HERE IT'S A VERY- DIFFERENT. PEOPLE FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF I ACTIONS THE AND THIS PIZZATHIS IS THAT- GENERAL IT'S HARD TO. HIRE PEOPLE IN THE NORMAL. ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN IN THE COUNTRY NOW PEOPLE COMING TO WORK- IN THIS FIELD- THIS WORK IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. IT'S EXTREMELY DEMANDING. IT'S TOUGH WORK. IT IS SO EMOTIONALLY. DIFFICULT FROM WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE SMELL WHAT WE ENCOUNTER FAMILY LOST DEATH CHECK TRUCK AND SO IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE INTO THESE JOBS. AND WHEN WE- BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO STEP UP DON'T GET ME WRONG WE DO HAVE DEDICATED FOLKS THAT WANT TO STEP UP BUT WHEN WE TELL CANDIDATES AT THE EMPLOYMENT. IS ONLY UP UP FOR THREE YEARS ARE NOT PERMITTED IT TENDS TO BE A DEAL BREAKER AND WE CAN NEVER SEEM TO CATCH UP- AND- AND OF COURSE WE CAN NEVER INSURE FOR- OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY AND EXPERTISE TO BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE- OR OR CONSTANTLY IN THIS CYCLE AS WE GET CLOSE TO THAT. TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD MOST PEOPLE ARE AROUND YOU KNOW BOUNCING OUT. OR LEAVING OR IF WE EVEN GET THEM TO STAY SO I'M NOT OPPOSED TO WORKING WITH THE LA- AND THE LEGISLATURE IN BUILDING OUT A STAFFING PLAN COULD PICK AN ARTICULATE THIS. BETTER BUT I WILL BUT I WILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M I'M SAYING TODAY THAT- I THINK THE WAY IT'S BEEN- DERISIVE IT'S A LITTLE MISS. BY CONFUSING AND- IN REALLY- WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR. IS A DIRECT- DIRECT ME BASED UPON WHAT THE- CONDITIONS TODAY AND WHAT WE PROJECT INTO THE FUTURE. ALL WILL BE HANDED OUT WE ARE ALREADY AT A DISADVANTAGE WE HAVE A- STATE OPERATIONS CENTER THAT HAS BEEN ACTIVATED FOR OVER EIGHT HUNDRED DAYS AND- AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH- WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. TO NOW WE HAVE ADDED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S FIVE ZERO THOUSAND HOMES DESTROYED IN CALIFORNIA- FOR WILDFIRE ALONE. NOT TO MENTION EARTHQUAKES AND- FLOODING IN OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS WE HAD AND ALL OF THAT IS TAKEN A LOT OF THAT EFFORT TO GET THESE THESE COMMUNITIES RECOVERED- AND- AND BACK UP ON THEIR FEET. SO WITHOUT ALL ALL STOP TO SAY HAPPY TO WORK WITH ELIO OPRY SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR DEALER D. G. R. I APPRECIATE- YOU'RE REMINDING US. ABOUT ALL THE- EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF YOURS STATEWIDE TEAM YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EVERYONE WHO PUTS IN WELL WHEN WE'RE IN TIME OF NEED SO- FROM THAT AND YOU CAN COUNT ON US TO BE AS SUPPORTIVE AS AS POSSIBLE- IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT. THE MOST EFFICIENT- AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU WE NEED TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THE EFFICIENCY AND- AND THE PLANNING BECAUSE WE TOO DON'T CANNOT SAY ANYTHING FOR SURE- FOR AS LONG AS WE'D LIKE TO- BUT- THAT'S DEFINITELY WITHIN OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES SO- WHEN COURAGE YOU ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE YOU TO- COME UP WITH A MORE STRATEGIC PLANNING. PROCESS ON THE ON THE STAFFING- ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO MAKE A- COMMENTER QUESTION NOPE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR PRESENTING. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ALSO- OH YES- ISSUE.

CALIFORNIA RIGHT OUTSIDE OF SACRAMENTO- THE PROJECTS INCLUDED THE MODERNIZATION OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTRE ALL ITS SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS- WORK BOTH WITHIN THE BUILDING AND AL AND OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING- AND SO THIS BUDGET REQUESTS THAT RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO FIND THE NEXT. PHASE OF EACH OF THESE EXISTING PROJECTS- AND ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES SUPPORT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH- INCLUDING ADDITIONAL SECURITY GUARDS THAT WOULD COME WITH THAT THEY NEED TO APPLE PIE THIS IS THE SECURITY OF A BRIDGE HERE. LEASING LEASE FUNDING FOR TEMPORARY SWING SPACE FOR STAFF WHILE THE- STATE OPERATIONS CENTER IS BEING MODIFIED SO THAT ORIGINAL PROJECT THAT WAS FUNDED- AND THE STUDY FOR THE RIGHT FOR THE- THE PLANS AT ALL. AND NOW WE WILL BE MOVING INTO THAT- CONSTRUCTION PHASE WHICH MEANS THAT WE OUGHT TO WE LITERALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH AS YOU AS YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST MENTIONED. IT'S A VERY VERY CRITICAL PLACE AND AM VERY BUSY PLACE AND RECREATE IT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION ABOUT. THE STATE OPERATION SHATTUCK SHELTER- AFTER THIS. FOR ISSUE EIGHT AND AGAIN HAPPY. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND THE- WE HAVE A OF LOT OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MOVE OUT OF A BUILDING AND- INTO SWING SPACE.

THANKS I'M SURE- OKAY ON THIS ONE UP THE BUDGET IS PROPOSING SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TO IMPLEMENT A NEW FEDERALLY MANDATED NINETY EIGHT EIGHT SUICIDE HOTLINE CALL SYSTEM TO INCREASE THE EASY ACCESSIBILITY TO PROVIDE HELP FOR THOSE CONSIDERING SUICIDE. OR SELF HARM- THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION MANDATED DID TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW NINE EIGHTY EIGHT SYSTEM BY JULY SIXTEENTH TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO. A CALORIE S. AS THE OPERATOR OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT CAPABILITY AND EXPERTISE TO SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE NINE EIGHT EIGHT CALLS THOSE WHO DIAL NINE EIGHT EIGHT WILL BE DIRECTED TO ONE OF THE EXISTING THIRTEEN A LIFELINE CALL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE CENTERS ALREADY PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH- SORRY MENTAL DISTRESS AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ENSURE FOR APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS TO- TO ENSURE THAT THOSE NEEDING SERVICES RECEIVED HELP OR FICTIONALLY. AS WELL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED FUNDS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM- THOSE FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED. IN THE HHS PROGRAM AREA SO FEDERAL FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY FOR CALLOW YESS TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM- WE WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE WITH HHS AGENCY AS WE IMPLEMENTED- THE TECHNICAL PIECE OF THIS AS THEY IMPLEMENT- THE PROGRAMMATIC PIECE- SO AGAIN THAT'S UP THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE A TEAM HERE WITH. OUR SPECIALIST IF YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR. ITEMS YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU BUT THE PART OF FINE. JURISTE OR SEND. IN ORDER TO FINANCE IT NOT NO REAL ADDITIONAL PRESENTATION JUST REITERATE THE DIRECTOR SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE THE MINISTRY FOR MAINE'S COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS WERE POSSIBLE SO TO THE EXTENT YOU KNOW WITHIN A FIGHTER ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE WE WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT. WE COORDINATE REGULARLY WITH OUR AGENT JUST COUNTERPARTS TO TRYING TO FIND OUT BUT AT THE MOMENT- WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY THAT'S AVAILABLE SO THAT'S WHY THE PROPOSALS GENERAL FUND. BEFORE YOU. WITHOUT AVAILABLE THEY'LL HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. TANK YOU AN L. A- PLEASE. SO WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE GIVEN THAT IT'S REQUIRED- IMPLEMENTATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WERE POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PROPOSAL AND SO WE WERE WITHHOLDING RECOMMENDATION AND SO- WE WERE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ON WHETHER SUCH FARMS WERE BEING AVAILABLE AND SO WE WILL WORK WITH. US AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE OR IF ALL AAILABLE FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO THE- HHS- AGENCY AND THEN WE WILL- UPDATE THE COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WHAT IS THE TIMELINE OF IMPLEMENTATION SINCE THE FEDERAL MANDATE TAKES EFFECT IN JULY. A MAN CHAIRMAN I HAVE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR MITCH MEDICARE WHICH OVERSEES THE PROGRAM I- YES GIVE YOU THE SPECIFICS ON THIS OKAY I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I THINK WE HAVE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO WERE WERE ABLE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE REDIRECTING SOME RESOURCING RIGHT NOW TO. START THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS ALL WHILE WE'RE WORKING WITH- THESE THIRTEEN CENTERS AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF. LOOKING AT THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND TO DO THE EVALUATION OF THE OF THE OF THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY AND THE MODIFICATIONS NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START WORKING. THE CONTRACTS IF FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE THAT WE CAN START THE IMPLEMENTATION TO TRY TO DO THAT- PROCUREMENT AND DO THAT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE- WE'RE ALSO DOING THE COORDINATION WITH AND I WANT TO BUY THREE BOARD ITS LONG RANGE PLANNING LONG RANGE PLANNING COMMITTEE. AND THAT IN TURN MEANS WITH ALL THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S FIRE CHIEFS AND POLICE CHIEFS. AS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS SO THAT'S KIND OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE WORKING NOW- IN STARTING IN SOME AREAS AND WORKING MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN OTHERS. IF WE RECEIVE THE FUNDING HERE IT WILL TAKE APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS BUT WHAT THIRTEEN EXISTING SITES THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CURRENTLY TAKE CALLS FOR- YOU KNOW- MENTAL HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES- REMAIN OPEN AND THE TRAFFIC FOR OVER TWO NINE EIGHT- THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE THOSE CALLS- ONCE THAT HAPPENS. WHY WHAT- YES NEED TO DO WHAT WE IS WHY IT IS FUNNY AS **** AS- THE ABILITY TO MOVE A CALL BACK FORTH. BETWEEN A NINE ONE ONE CALL THAT SHOULD BE AND I MADE A CALL AND I MADE A CALL THAT SHOULD BE A NINE ONE ONE CALL. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE LOCATION OF WHERE YOU'RE CALLING FROM. A PHONE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE CALLING FROM. IS THAT YOU STAY IN THE QUEUE IS A PRIORITY AND NOT GOING INTO THE BACK OF THE QUEUE- SOMEWHERE WHILE YOU'RE WAITING- IT HAPPENS SEAMLESSLY. AND THAT INTERACTION AND THAT MOVEMENTS ARE TO THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT TAKES PLACE IN SO THE INTEGRATION THAT TECHNICAL SOLUTION. IS WHAT- YES IT'S GOING TO WORK ON AND THAT INCLUDES TEXTING- TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL HAPPENS- PROPERLY WITH THE NEXT GENERATION ON ONE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE ALREADY WORKING ON AS WELL SO. HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE- WEEK SO GREATLY APPRECIATE. THAT SERVICE. AND IT I'M SURE IT'S JUST. A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE AND DEATH. SITUATION ARE THESE THE ONLY RESOURCES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. OR DO YOU DO EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDS. I'M SURE THIS IS A SMOG AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERE AND- YES- PERHAPS ARE I THINK THESE ARE THE ONLY RESOURCES THAT OUR AGENCY WILL BE REQUESTING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY HAVE MORE VISIBILITY ON KIND OF WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. SIDE OF THE HOUSE MAY BE REQUESTING RELATIVE TO PROGRAMMING AND THE RESPONSE ASPECT OF IT. I'M SURE STEVEN BENEFITS PARTNER FINANCE I I'M NOT CURRENTLY TRACKING ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT THIS TIME- I HAVE A LOT HAPPY TO. COORDINATE WITH MY TEACHERS COUNTERPARTS AND- FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT I'M I'M NOT TRACKING ANYTHING ELSE THE MOMENT. OKAY IF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATORS HEARING NONE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE TEN. THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. DIRECTOR RIGHT EXPAND SHARE- BOY HERE'S ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM- AND- AND THIS IS- OUR PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW- AND NOW WE'RE REQUESTING AN AGENDA ITEM OF SEVENTEEN POINT ONE MILLION AND THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THIS- EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING PROGRAM- AS YOU MAY KNOW THIS IS A STATE OF THE ART SEISMIC WARNING SYSTEM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EARLY WARNING OF AN IMPENDING EARTHQUAKE OUR SYSTEM IS STATEWIDE AND HAS ALREADY BEEN A CENTRAL AND SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING EARLY NOTIFICATIONS OF EARTHQUAKES ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. APPROVAL OF THIS REQUEST WOULD DO A FEW THINGS NECESSARY FOR CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM FIRST IT WOULD INCREASE THE EARTHQUAKE SENSOR DENSITY INTO THE RURAL PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA A PART OF THE EFFORT IS TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- SO THAT WE GET THE MOST IT REACHED- DATA UP FROM WHAT WAS ON THE SENSORS A SECOND ITEM WOULD BE TO FIND GRANTS TO COMMUNITY. BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO EDUCATE SOCIALLY ISOLATED GROUPS IN UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES ON THE PROGRAM AND HOW TO UTILIZE IT- TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY- WITHIN YOUR AREA- THERE'S TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS APPLICATION YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT- THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING ON YOUR PHONE- BUT THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE END FOR. AND EDUC IS A PART THAT MATTER USE IT. AND THEN THE THIRD IS- THAT WOULD WOULD BE TO SUPPORT. THE NECESSARY RESEARCH ON ON NEW PUBLIC ALERT METHOD SO PART OF THIS IS ALWAYS- STAYING ON CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PUSHING OUT THE- SIGNAL- AND THE ALERT. TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO- TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY- TO THE VARIOUS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS LIKE RETAIL- AND HEALTH AND OUR PORCH- TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF. OF RAIL A SLOWING OR STOPPING A TRAIN PRIOR TO THE SHAKING REACHING- THE TRAIN TRACKS AND DERAILING A TRAIN FOR EXAMPLE SO WORK THIS IS THIS CONSTANT OUR RESEARCH EFFORT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE. WILL BE IMPORTANT SO THIS OUT PROPOSAL IS- A PROPOSAL TO- CONTINUE TO- TO AMPLIFY THE THIS THE. SYSTEM AND PUT IT IN PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF PRESENTATION BUT AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU- AND LA- PLEASE. SIMILAR TO THE PROPOSALS- WE DISCUSSED EARLIER WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THIS APPROACH PROPOSAL BE APPROVED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS AND BE RECONSIDERED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE STRATEGIC PLANNER BASELINE BUDGET REVIEW I MENTIONED EARLIER- WELL THE SYSTEM IS POTENTIALLY PROMISING WITHOUT A STRATEGIC PLAN IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CURRENT APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEM ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL RESPONSE CAPACITY GOALS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CURRENT EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BENEFITS OR WHETHER ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES SUCH AS INCREASED FUNDING FOR BUILDING SEISMIC RETROFITS WOULD BETTER INDICATE. THE POTENTIAL HARM FROM EARTHQUAKES. TIONS OKAY. GOOD QUESTIONS- DIRECTOR DEALER DID YOU COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. I KNOW THEY'RE SIMILAR TO US ANOTHER ISSUE BUT- THANKS MANAGER- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK IT DID THE ISSUE IS SATIATED WITH THE- STRATEGIC PLAN ON. PERSONNEL AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE LA I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT BEFORE. WARNING PROGRAM IS OUT OF LEGISLATIVELY- IT YOU KNOW MANDATED PROGRAM THAT- THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND- HAS HAD YOU KNOW STRATEGIC PLANS AND OPERATIONAL PLANS AROUND THAT SPIN BRIEFINGS TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S AN ADVISORY BOARD THAT HAS LEGISLATED PARTNERSHIP ON IT. SO YOU KNOW HOW CAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LA- TO CLARIFY- WE KNOW WHAT THE NEEDSARE THERE- AND THEN SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF THE- ON THE ISSUE OF THE OF THE PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS IN THAT PROGRAM- AGAIN YOU KNOW MY COMMENTS FROM BEFORE BUT HOW HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LA- TO. TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THIS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT WILL BE A- COLLEAGUE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NOT. ENOUGH DURING A JOB. OKAY RIGHT- I DO HAVE. ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THE ISSUE OF THE CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC MEDIA MEDIA'S ROLE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC TELEVISION'S ROLE- IN THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM- ARE. ASKING FOR A BOAT. PILOT EXPANSION- AND I'D HOPE THAT YOU WILL. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WE ARE CONSIDERING IT WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH ABOUT- BROADCASTERS AND THAT CALIFORNIA WHEN I SPEAK SPOKE EARLIER TO. RESEARCH ON NEW WAYS OF DOING THE PUBLIC A WORK ALERTS JUST METHODS THIS IS ONE AREA THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SO- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT THAT BAD THOUGH IT'S SPEED AT WHICH WE CAN GET THE SIGNAL OUT BECAUSE AS YOU. AS YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF SECONDS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE AND- THE FASTER WE CAN GET THE SIGNAL OUT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THE MORE- THE MARKET COULD HAPPEN MORE LIVES CAN BE SAVED SO- CERTAINLY HAPPY TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM BUT- WE WOULD LIKE TO GAUGE THEM EVEN FURTHER- WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THANK YOU DIRECTOR I MEAN THAT. IS A DUMB. IN A SOMETIMES THE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AS GREAT AS IT IS AND FAST IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES CAN. REALLY GET ALL CLOGGED UP THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING IT SO I WORRY ABOUT BEING TOO DEPENDENT ON. CELL PHONES. YOU KNOW TO GET THE WORD OUT ON A ON A LARGER SCALE- APPRECIATE THAT- OKAY- MOVING ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN WE'RE ALMOST DONE HERE. ISSUE ELEVEN WHICH IS FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM OF AGAIN DIRECTOR. GHILARDUCCI OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN THANKS TO MOVE SOME BOXES OF RAPIDLY IT'S GREAT- SO THIS THIS- AGAIN ONE OF THE VERTICALS AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE ASK IS ARE OUR FIRE AND RESCUE DIVISION- AND AS I KNOW YOU KNOW WE- WILL HAVE MANY FIRES IN YOU AND YOUR DISTRICT WE- WE HAVE AS A PART OF THAT. FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM I'M A VERY ROBUST- IF PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE- YES FIRE ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT THAT WE ASSIGNED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN A PARTNERSHIP- WHEN THERE IS A MAJOR FIRE MAJOR DISASTER THEY'RE READY ALL HAZARDS- COULD BE FOR EARTHQUAKE FIRE FLOOD OR- OR TERRORIST ATTACK WHATEVER WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THESE. THESE ARE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT- THEY AUGMENT THE STATE'S FORCES THERE FORCE MULTIPLIER- AND THEY'RE SUPPORTED WITH OUR PARTNERS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO THIS PROPOSAL- PROPOSES ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ELEVEN POSITIONS TO MAINTAIN- THE STATE FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM FIRE FLEET SO- AND I'VE GOT CHIEF. CHIEF UPRIGHT MARSHALL HERE'S THE STATE'S FIRE RESCUE CHIEF- BUT TALK MORE IN DETAIL ABOUT IT SHOULD BE QUESTIONS BUT BUT YOU KNOW HELLO HELLO YES PROVIDES. THIS THESE RESOURCES AND THEY NEED TO BE- MAINTAINED GIVEN THE READ THE NUMBER ON- AND THE AND THE AND THE FREQUENCY OF USE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING- WITH THIS A QUICK MET- AND- AND SO THAT'S PART OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO. PROVIDE US SUPPORT CAPACITY FOR ALL OF THAT A QUICK MINUTE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A REPLACEMENT CYCLE- BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MAINTAINED APPROPRIATELY AND THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THEM WHEN THEY MEET ARE NEEDED. AND THE SECOND PART OF THIS. PROPOSAL- IS FOUR MILLION ALL ORDERS AT APRIL RESERVATION TO ENHANCE OUR THIS. FIRE AND RESCUE. MUTUAL AID TO BY TRANSFERRING OUR TRAINING OPERATIONS CENTER FROM. WHAT WAS ONCE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY CALLED THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESCUE TRAINING AUTHORITY TO CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE WHICH IS THE TRADING ARM. OF UP- WE ASK- BECAUSE BY UTILIZING THE CALVARY SPECIALIZED TRAINING IS TO PROVIDE FIREFIGHTER TRAINING INCLUDING SPECIALIZED AND HIGHLY TECHNICAL RESCUE TRAINING- THE SYSTEM WILL BE BETTER POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS. BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING BAD IS- ALL FIRE AGENCIES IN THE STATE. ARE PARTICIPATING IN IN AND CAN BENEFIT FROM. IT ALIGNS WITH OUR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS AND IT BRINGS OUT THIS FIRE- TRAINING PIECE PARTICULARLY THE TECHNICAL RESCUE PEACE. ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT SO THAT WE ARE APPROACHING THINGS- AS I SAY IN A ONE TO ONE FIGHT EFFORTS THIS- THIS THIS- UNIFIED EFFORT FOR- ENSURING THAT WE'VE GOT CAPACITY. TO DEAL WITH ALL HAZARDS IN THE STATE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING. RECENTLY ON MAJOR WILDFIRES- BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT. HI IF ANYTHING DOES IT'S- A BIG EARTHQUAKE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT I'M SURE THIS IS A- FACTOR OF CONCERN- BUT- WE HAVEN'T HAD IT REALLY YES IS THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. WELL WE HAD MODERATE SIZE QUAKES BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT ENOUGH CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE'LL BE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL. AND SO ALL OF THIS- ENHANCEMENT TO THE SYSTEM. IS. DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THAT IS READY TO GO WHEN THESE EVENTS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR- MOVE ON TO FINANCE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THE MESSAGE PART OF FINANCE- JUST ONE COMMENT IN REGARDS TO ACT AND GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF MR SODERBERGH WHO WILL BE UP NEXT WEEK AND ENGENDER TALKS ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THIS IS ONE WORD AGAIN THERE'S THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR YOU CAN FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS. TO VALUATE FUTURE BUDGET PROPOSALS I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WITH SPECIALLY FIRE FLEET THIS IS REALLY FUNDING TO MAINTAIN EXISTING NUMBER OF APPARATUS. SO ALL OF THOSE FRONT ALL OF THOSE APPARATUS HAVE A USEFUL LIFE AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED ON AVERAGE BUT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS AND THIS FUNDING IS REALLY ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO REPLACE THOSE AND KEEP THEM. OUT PROPERLY MAINTAINED SO THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THIS ONE REALLY ISN'T ABOUT ADDING. THAT INCREASING NUMBER OF ENGINES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT MAINTAINING THE FLEET WE ALREADY HAVE. THIS WITHOUT AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- L. L. ALES OFFICE PLEASE. YES SO WHEN THIS PROPOSAL WAS FIRST ARE PROVIDED TO OUR OFFICE I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE BUYER FOR THE PROPOSAL IT WAS UNCLEAR TO US WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDING- WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR MAINTENANCE OR WHETHER IT WAS TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ENGINES AVAILABLE. AND SO IN OUR VIEW AT THAT TIME- WE WERE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION INTEL- THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSAL WAS MADE CLEAR- SO WE'LL WORK WITH- YES AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHAT PRECISELY. THE PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO DO AND IN TERMS OF- FIRE FLEET CAPACITY. AND UPDATE THE COMMITTEE AT THAT POINT. WITH RESPECT TO THE- SEARCH AND RESCUE- TEAMS AS WE RECOMMEND IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT THIS BE APPROVED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE AN EXISTING STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP TO PROVIDE TRAINING. WITH A STATE RUN PROGRAM AT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COSTS. SPECIFICALLY UNDER THE PROPOSAL- YES WOULD SPEND TWO MILLION MORE ANNUALLY TO PROVIDE TRAINING WHICH CURRENTLY COSTS THE STATE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY. AND ACCORDINGLY ABSENT ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR INCREASING THE COST OF TRAINING WE RECOMMEND NOT APPROVING. THE FUNDING FOR THAT COMPONENT OF THE SEARCH AND RESCUE PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD ONLY APPROVING FUNDING. FOR THE OTHER TWO COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY THE LOCAL SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS AND A MOBILE TRAINING EXERCISE REIMBURSEMENT ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU YES OUR DIRECTOR GO DUE TO COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS OF. THE INCREASED COST TO THE STATE FOR. THE TRANSFER. OF THE OF THE TRAINING- THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS. WHAT IS VALUE THAT VAN. THAT'S GIVEN THAT'S CREATED HELP. SURE LET ME- WELL IF I IF I COULD- MANAGER JUST ON THE ISSUE OF THE FIRE FLEET- THAT IS NOT AN EXPANSION OF THE FIRE FLEET- NOT TO SAY THAT. WE DON'T NEED MORE FIRES IN THE STATE BUT- WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR AN EXPANSION OF A PLACE JUST TO BE CLEAR- IT IS STRICTLY MAINTENANCE AND ONGOING- FOR THE EXIT. FLEET CHARTERED CLARIFY THAT- ON THE ON THE SECOND PIECE- BELLOWS CORRECT IT WHEN HE SAID THAT THE ORIGINAL- AMOUNT AS BAND- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND FOR. TRAINING IS WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE GPA THAT THAT WE HAD- WERE OFFERING TRAINING- I WILL TELL YOU THAT. WE HAVE- TRAINING THAT IS WOEFULLY- INEFFICIENT INSUFFICIENT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- TRAINING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND WAS PUT IN THE BUDGET YEARS AND YEARS AGO- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRADING UP HELLO BOB EXPERTISE OF TECHNICAL- RESEARCHER RESCUE. CAPABILITIES ISSUE THESE ARE THE SPECIAL FORCES THAT IF ANYTHING EVER FIRE SERVICE THE ABILITY TO TRAIN THEM IN TRAINING GOOD TRAINING AND QUALITY TRAINING AND GETTING THIS KIND OF EXPERTISE TRAINING- IS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T ISN'T CHEAP BUT IT ALSO IS- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS- PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN KEEPING THESE TEAMS- READY TO GO AT THIS STAGE REQUEST FOR MUTUAL AID RESPONSE- BUT THE LOCALS ARE ALSO DOING A LEVEL OF TRAINING. BUT THIS ISN'T UP ABOVE AND BEYOND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THESE MAJOR EVENTS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR- IN IN IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY- FOR YOU KNOW- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS- YOU KNOW WELL YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT IT'S JUST NOT A LOT WHEN IT COMES TO KIND OF TRAINING AND CAPACITY THAT'S NECESSARY SO THAT'S OUR RESPONDED BACK BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE WE'VE ADJUSTED THIS AND- AND DEAD TO GET THESE THESE TEAMS WHERE WE NEED THEM- WE ESTIMATE. THAT THE COST WILL BE ABOUT THIS MUCH. OKAY COLLEAGUES AND HE QUESTION ARE CALM. NO THANK YOU DIRECTOR- AND WE MOVE ON TO THE FINAL. ISSUE I THINK YES IT IS AN ISSUE TWELVE IS DISASTER FUNDING BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO- AGAIN A DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI COULD YOU RESPOND OR PRESENT ON THIS ISSUE. SURE BACKBENCHER US SO THE FINAL AGENDA ITEM HERE REALLY INCLUDES TRUE PROPOSALS ARE GOOD ADDRESSES RESOURCES FOR THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS THE FIRST IS A CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT- IN THIS CASE THIS IS A BUDGET ITEM THAT INCLUDES A ONE TIME INCREASE. OF A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE HI AN ONGOING INCREASE OF THIRTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE COSTS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF DISASTERS- IT'S BUDGET TORY ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT- IS REGULARLY UPDATED IN EACH BUDGET CYCLE AND LET ME JUST KIND OF FRAME IS A LITTLE BIT. SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON GOVERNOR PROCLAIMED A STATE OF EMERGENCY- THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE WHETHER IT'S A WILDFIRE EARTHQUAKE SOMETHING THAT IS COST INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE OR COST TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT WEATHER. COULD BE THEIR RESPONSE COSTS. WE MEET NEEDS UP MORE IMPORTANT- BEAT THE COST TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT IS A IS A- PROGRAM. THAT IS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GOVERNMENTS THAT MAY BE HAVING COURAGE DISASTER- AND THEY APPLY- TO THE TWO OH YES AND DO THAT. GOVERNOR FOR- YES- THIS SELF FIND BEING- AND IT HELPS TO OFFSET THE COST OF THE RECOVERY. SO THAT'S THE FIRST- ONE IN THIS TWO PART BEES IN THE SECOND ONE- IS MISSION TASKING APPROPRIATION- AND THAT IS- AUTHORIZING- HELLO YES TO- MISSION TASK OTHER. AGENCIES ARE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES THAT WE HAVE MISSION TASKING AUTHORITY CURRENTLY- AND WHAT THIS IS THAT IF I NEED TO HAVE. A TRUE EMERGENCY AND I NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER AGENCY RESPOND. CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD THE CALIFORNIA CONTROL CAL FIRE WHOMEVER- I THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTRE CAST THAT AGENCY TO RESPOND. THERE IS NO FUN BEING NECESSARILY IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT. THOSE AGENCIES TO RESPOND THEY'RE TAKING IT OUT OF THEIR OWN EXISTING BUDGET- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IN THIS IN THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY FREQUENCY AND THE CHALLENGES OF THE OF THE ON GOING- BUT DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES MACHINE. THE AMOUNT OF TASKINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING HAVE EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED. WHICH HAS BEEN FAR MORE COMPLICATED FOR AGENCY DEPARTMENT TO THE POINT THAT WE GOT AGENCIES APARTMENTS THAT HAVE SORT OF. BEEN RIPPED RETICENT ABOUT RESPONDING- UNTIL WE CAN WORK OUT SOME FUNNY. MECHANISM AND SO- IS OUT OF A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD OFFER- I. TWO MILLION. TO COVER SORT OF AN IMMEDIATE. COST THAT WE COULD COVER IMMEDIATE RESPONSE- FOR AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE CAST- AND- AND SO I'LL STOP HERE AND IT MAY BE OFFERED FOR ME TO FIND A JOB YOU NEED TO. BRING THESE LITTLE BIT MORE- THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUT- AND- AND THEN ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THESE TWO POINTS. OKAY THANK YOU DIRECTOR ARE WE WILL HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. EXTREMISTS ARE FINE IT'S JUST ONE CLARIFICATION IS THE REQUEST IS FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- I THINK THE DIRECTOR IS MUCH DIFFERENT AND THEN WE HAD A TWENTY NINE DOLLAR ONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT TODAY JUST TO CLARIFY ITS TEN NINE I'M GOING IS TO REQUEST- AND JUST. KIND OF RIFF REFERRING TO THE AGENDA AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE OHIO- I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION THERE ABOUT NINETY EIGHT FORTY INABILITY TO USE THAT I'M JUST COMMENTING ON THAT BRIEFLY- NINETY FOUR HE DOES HAVE A PROVISION AND THAT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF IT. AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE- BUT NINETY FORTY ALSO HAS LIMITATIONS INTO THE AMOUNT OF THE IN AUGMENTATION. THAT SOME CASES CAN BE VERY PROBLEMATIC TO SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS- SMALL APARTMENTS WITH SMALL CORPORATION AMOUNTS AND NINETY EIGHT FORTY IS LIMITED TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF APPROPRIATION IN SOME CASES SO YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW CORPORATION OF BOSTON. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE LIMITED TO COVER 30% AUGMENTATION AND WHY CASES THOSE AUGMENTATION LIMITATIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR MANY OF THESE DEPARTMENTS TO RESPOND. CASES LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL OR POWER CYCLE THAT MAY NEED TO GO OUT AND DO THE REMOVAL. OF ACTIVITIES YOU KNOW VERY QUICKLY HERE I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T THE MOBILE EYES AND. AND MOVE WITHIN. YOU KNOW A DAY OR TWO- SO MAKING SURE WE HAVE MADE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE RESPONSE ACTIVE. THAT THEY TO DO HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE OVER LAST FEW YEARS- OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE HAVE A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. FUNDING MECHANISM AND SO WE HAVE THAT APPROACH BEING ABLE TO HANDLE THAT AND THAT. SOME OF THESE DISASTERS THAT DON'T ALWAYS WRITES THE SAME MAGNITUDE OF A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY STILL REQUIRE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES YOU KNOW THE DIRECTOR WAS TALKING TO AND- THERE ARE ISSUES WITH SOME OF THESE. DEPARTMENTS THAT WE NEED- THAT HAVE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE TO RESPOND TO THESE DISASTERS. THAT'S THE NATURE OF IT AND WHY NINETY EIGHT FOUR. CERTAINLY THAT EXIST AND CAN BE USED FOR RECEIVING. RESPONSE IT ALSO HAS A BROADER. APPLICATION AND YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT WE USE THAT OFFERING TO RESPONSE THEN STARTS TO- IT ON THE BUILDING USE THAT MY- FOR OTHER. COSTS THAT YOU KNOW IT FREQUENTLY IS USED FOR AS WELL SO. JUST THERE'S A FEW LIMITATIONS OF NINETY EIGHT FORTY DON'T REALLY MEET THE- NEEDS OF THIS MISSION TASKING- FUNDING. BUT WITHOUT AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN THE L. A. O. COMMENTS PLEASE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED INCREASE AND- CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT FUNDING. WITH RESPECT TO THE MISSION TASKING APPROPRIATION AS MR BENTSEN INDICATED. WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL FOR TWO REASONS FIRST AS WAS MENTIONED B. NINETY EIGHT FORTY ITEMS IN THE BUDGET ALREADY PROVIDE FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO BE USED FOR UNEXPECTED OR EMERGENCY COSTS UPON APPROVAL THE BENEFIT OF THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY ITEMS IS THAT THEY- ARE SUBJECT TO A GREAT DEAL MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THEN WHAT WOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE ABLE TO AUGMENT OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION AND- YES WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ONLINE- THE AUGMENTATIONS MADE ONCE ON MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BOMB BLASTS. IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO QUITE A BIT LESS TRANSPARENCY AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WITH REGARD TO THE LIMITATIONS ON THAT MR MENTIONED MISTER ROBINSON EXCUSE ME MENTIONED ABOUT THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED AND ADDRESSING THOSE WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO IDENTIFY OPTIONS TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS. HAPPY. TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE LA- ON THIS I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S ALREADY SOME FUNDING ON THIS AND IF THERE'S SOME REALLY SPECIFIC. NEEDS THAT ARE NOT COVERED- THROUGH THE- REGULAR PROCESS THEN- I'M SURE WE COULD FIGURE THAT WAS UP. OKAY- COMPANION SENATOR. COMMENTS. OKAY IF IT WAS AVAILABLE IN THE SPRING.
