SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FORTY ONE BY SENATOR BRADFORD RELATIVE TO JUNETEENTH. MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I. RISE TO PRESENT S. C. R. FORTY ONE. S. C. R. FORTY ONE COMMEMORATES JUNETEENTH THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF WHICH IS HAPPENING THIS SATURDAY. AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE PRAYER JUNETEENTH MARKS THE DAY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN A GROUP OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE IN GALVESTON TEXAS FINALLY LEARNED THAT THEY WERE FREE FROM SLAVERY. BUT WOEFULLY THIS WAS ALMOST TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SIGNED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. AS MUCH AS JUNETEENTH REPRESENTS FREEDOM IT ALSO REPRESENTS HOW EMANCIPATION WAS TRAGICALLY DELAYED FOR ENSLAVED PEOPLE IN THE DEEPEST REACHES OF THE CONFEDERACY. ON JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WHICH DECLARED THAT ALL PERSONS HELD AS SLAVES. R. AND HENCEFORTH SHALL BE FREE. OF COURSE LIKE MOST LAWS THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS WHICH THE SENATE ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE BY PASSING THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT A YEAR LATER PROHIBITING SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE IN ALL STATES. UNION AND THE CONFEDERACY BUT THE AMENDMENTS WERE NOT ENACTED UNTIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE. POLITICS ECONOMICS AND THE SOUTH. RECONSTRUCTION THE TIME AFTER THAT FOCUSED ON REBUILDING THE SOUTHERN ECONOMY AND SOCIETY THROUGH THE RATIFICATION OF THE THIRTEENTH FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AMENDMENTS WHICH GAVE BLACK PEOPLE FREEDOM DUE PROCESS AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE. BUT THOSE GOALS WERE CONSISTENTLY COUNTERED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS WHO WORKED TO WEAKEN BLACK VOTING IN THE SOUTH. BY MEANS OF GERRYMANDERING VIOLENCE INTIMIDATION AND DISCRIMINATORY PROVISIONS AROUND LITERACY. AND THOSE ACTIONS USHERED IN JIM CROW. THIS IS THE JOURNEY FOR FREEDOM FOR BLACK AMERICANS I HISTORY NOT TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS AND NOT WELL KNOWN BY MOST AMERICANS. EVEN MANY BLACK FOLKS IT IS A JOURNEY FILLED WITH DELAYS FALSE STARTS AND I- USE. IT'S A JOURNEY THAT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONLY BECAUSE MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER. THE FIRST PERSON TO HOLD ME WHEN I WAS BORN. HAD BEEN BORN A SLAVE. AND HAD BEEN FREED BY LINCOLN. AND SHE HAD HER PAPERS AND HER REPUBLICAN REGISTRATION CARD TO PROVE IT. IT IS GREAT THAT THE U. S. SENATE HAS PASSED A BILL TO MAKE JUNETEENTH A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT SIGNS THAT BILL. WHAT I HOPE MORE FOR OUR RIGHTEOUS DISCUSSIONS AND ACTIONS BY THIS BODY AROUND POVERTY ALLEVIATION WEALTH BUILDING EQUITY AND PROTECTING ALL OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. TO DUE PROCESS AND TO BE FREE. YOU KNOW A FEW WEEKS AGO MY MOTHER WAS IN WHOLE FOODS AND SHE WAS CHECKING OUT AT THE CASHIERS WHO HAPPENS TO BE A BLACK WOMAN AND ASK THIS WAS GOING ON SHE WAS LOADING THINGS OUT OF HER CAR SHE TURNED AROUND AND SAW THIS WHITE MAN AND HIS DOG. BOUNDING INTO WHOLE FOODS WALKING DOWN THE AISLE THE DOG WAS NOT LEASHED THE DOG WAS NOT A SERVICE DOG. AND THEY WERE JUST HAPPY AND SHOPPING. AND MY MOTHER FROWNED. AND FURROWED HER BROW IN TURN TO THE CASHIER. TO LOOK LIKE HAN AND THE CASHIER TURNED TO HER SO EVENLY AND SAD. THEY HAVE DOMINION OVER THEIR SALES. IN OTHER WORDS SHE WAS SAYING. WHITE PEOPLE ARE FREE AND WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE FREE YOU ACT FREE. IT IS A BIT MORE UNFORGIVING AND COMPLICATED TO BE BLACK. OUR FREEDOM FEELS TENUOUS AND SITUATIONAL. AND THAT IS FELT IN THE FIGHT SO IF WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST TREATMENT IN THE COURTS BY THE STATE BAR WITHIN OUR PRISONS IF WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST UNFAIR TREATMENT IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS AGAINST AN ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE AGAINST UNFAIR BEHAVIORS BY LENDING INSTITUTIONS OR HOUSING PROVIDERS. AGAINST DISPROPORTIONATELY ON CLEAN WATER AIR OR LAND. IF WE ARE FIGHTING TO STAY ALIVE TO WALK WITH SKITTLES OR SLEEP IN OUR BED TO BIRD WATCH OR RIDE A BIKE. TO HAVE BIBLE STUDY IN OUR CHURCH OR GO JOGGING OR EVEN TO BREEZE. ALL WHILE BEING BLACK. THEN WE ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR THAT FREEDOM OVER DOMINION. OVER OURSELVES. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK AT THE RIGHT POINT FOUR AND I VOTE ON AS THE R. FORTY ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR KAMMERER SENATOR PYNE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR FORTY ONE ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND- I FIND MYSELF CHALLENGE TO FOLLOW THE ELEGANT WORDS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES- AND- I JUST I WOULD JUST TAKE NOTE THAT- AND VERY SOON WE'LL BE CELEBRATING ALSO- JULY FOURTH. INDEPENDENCE DAY. IN FACT ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX OUR COUNTRY HOW WE DECLARED OUR INDEPENDENCE- AS A COUNTRY- IN THE DOCUMENTS WITH- MANY ASPIRATIONS- TALKS ABOUT THE L. WORDS OF FREEDOM- BREAKS. BUT YET- WHEN OUR COUNTRY ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION. WE CONTINUED TO INCLUDE BONDAGE AND SLAVERY. FOR BLACK AMERICANS IN FACT- AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT JUNETEENTH AND THE EVENTS OF JUNE NINETEENTH NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THAT'S ALMOST EIGHTY NINE YEARS LATER. AFTER A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHEN FINALLY A GROUP OF AMERICANS WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER IN BONDAGE THAT WAS KEPT OUR FELLOW AMERICANS IN BONDAGE. FOR OFF FOR EIGHTY NINE YEARS. AND SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND RECOGNITION OF THE STRUGGLES OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY BLACK AMERICANS TO JUST SIMPLY BE FREE FROM BONDAGE NOT EQUITY NOT EQUALITY JUST SIMPLY FREE FROM BONDAGE AT LEAST LEGAL. CLASS SLAVERY BONDAGE AND THEIR STRUGGLE IS ONE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR COUNTRY AND- WHERE WE'VE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO- CERTAINLY AS AN ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER- I APPRECIATE THE- LEADERSHIP AND SELFLESS ADVOCACY OF SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS FOR- FOR MY COMMUNITY. FREDERICK DOUGLASS. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING RIVER JESSE JACKSON ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF BLACK AMERICAN LEADERS HAVE LENT THEIR VOICES IN SUPPORT OF THE API COMMUNITY. AND OUR CONTINUED SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR ONE ANOTHER IN THE FACE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. IS PART OF BENDING THAT VERY LONG ARC- OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE TOWARD JUSTICE. WE NEED TO BE SURE WE MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER AND THIS RESOLUTION IS A REMINDER THAT THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. AND THE QUALITY IS AN ONGOING ONE AND A VERY LONG ONE BUT ONE THAT WE MUST. I WORK HARD TO ACHIEVE AND CERTAINLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION- FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF BLACK AMERICANS ON BEHALF OF ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR INCLUDING THE API COMMUNITY- IN A TRADE CHIEF JUSTICE. SO- L. PAYING TRIBUTE TO JUNETEENTH IS PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY. AND IT'S A HISTORY THAT WE SHOULD WE NEED TO ALL LEARN. AND EMBRACE. BUT NOT JUST KNOW THE HISTORY BUT THEN COMMIT OURSELVES TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. TO ACHIEVE THOSE IDEALS ARE PROCLAIMED BY THE FOUNDERS BACK IN SEVENTY SEVENTY SIX. BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACHIEVED SO WITH THAT I HEARD TONIGHT VOTE ON SCR FORTY ONE THANK YOU. SENATOR EYES OF. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE AS A CALIFORNIAN AS A STATE SENATOR REPRESENTING DISTRICT TWENTY FOUR. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. C. R. FORTY ONE RELATIVE TO JUNETEENTH. JUNETEENTH ALSO KNOWN AS FREEDOM THERE FOR EMANCIPATION DAY IS SYMBOLIC IN THAT IT IS CONSIDERED THE DATE WHEN THE LAST SLAVES IN AMERICA WERE QUOTE UNQUOTE FREED. ALMOST TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION I USE THE TERM QUOTE UNQUOTE FREED LOOSELY. BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS OUTLAWED BUT WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT REALITIES. THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY HOWEVER DID NOT BRING EQUALITY. JUNETEENTH HAPPENED EIGHTY NINE YEARS AFTER THE U. S. INDEPENDENCE DAY AND IT WOULD BE ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED YEARS. BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT GAIN TRACTION AND STARTED TO RIGHT THE WRONG OF SEGREGATION YES BLACK MEN AND WOMEN WERE QUOTING QUOTE FREE. BUT THEY WERE NOT FREE TO LIVE WHERE AND HOW THEY WISHED. AS I PREVIOUSLY SAID ON THE FLOOR UNDERSTANDING OUR PAST. AND KNOWLEDGE IN OUR HEROES OF OUR DIFFERENT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WILL STRENGTHEN THE TIES BETWEEN EVERY RESIDENT OF THE STATE AS WE CELEBRATE JUNETEENTH AND ASK ALL CALIFORNIANS TO HONOR AND REFLECT. ON THE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE IMPACT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS A PLATE. IN THE EVOLUTION ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS NATION WE MUST CONTINUE THIS FIGHT. WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING REAL EQUALITY AND REAL JUSTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I'D IKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP EVERY SINGLE DAY. WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND ASK YOU TO SUPPORT S. C. R. FORTY ONE THANK YOU. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION- THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND BLACK CALIFORNIANS AND AMERICANS JUNETEENTH IS THE OLDEST AFRICAN AMERICAN HOLIDAY WE HAVE SERVED THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE RECOGNIZE THE HISTORY BEHIND IT. SLAVERY IS A STAIN ON AMERICAN HISTORY BUT THE END OF SLAVERY THAT WE CELEBRATE. DID NOT END SYSTEMIC RACISM IT DID NOT AND ANTI BLACK RACISM- THESE INDOOR TO TODAY. WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY IT'S BEEN LESS THAN A HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS SINCE WE ENDED SLAVERY AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF WORK TO DO AS WE SEE RIGHT NOW WITH THE WAVE. OF VOTING RESTRICTIONS THAT MANY OF OUR COUNTERPARTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE PASSING RIGHT NOW IN STATE LEGISLATURES. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO TRY TO EDUCATE THE POPULATION INTO TEAMS AND RECOGNIZING JUNETEENTH IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO START- TECHNOLOGY OUR COUNTRY'S MISTAKES THE SERVICE AND EDUCATIONAL TEACHABLE MOMENT FOR ALL OF US. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND ALSO AS AN EDUCATOR WHO STRONGLY BELIEVES IN TELLING OUR HISTORY NO MATTER HOW DARK IT IS SO THAT WE EDUCATE AND NEVER FORGET AND BECOME BETTER FOR IT BLACK WOMEN HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO THE CELEBRATION OF JUNETEENTH AND THE COMMEMORATION OF EMANCIPATION SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. NEARLY EMANCIPATED SLAVES WALKED OFF THE PLANTATION WEARING THE FINEST CLOTHING FROM THEIR MISTRESSES THROUGH THE UNION CAM AND DANCING AND CELEBRATION BEGINNING IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BLACK WOMEN ACTIVISTS PUBLIC HISTORIANS OF THE HORRORS AND HUMILIATIONS THEY HAVE TWO INDOOR TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION THE ORGANIZED PAGEANTS PARADES ON JUNETEENTH AND EMANCIPATION DAY PORTRAYED SLAVES AND SLAVEHOLDERS AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT THE ATROCITIES OF THOSE ERAS ARE NEVER FRGOTTEN. DURING THE GREAT MIGRATION BLACK TEXANS MOVE TO THE WEST COAST INCLUDING CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES BAKERSFIELD OAKLAND AND SACRAMENTO BRINGING JUNETEENTH WITH THEM AFTER THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE LABOR OF BLACK WOMEN AS COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS PLANNERS ACTIVISTS FOOD PREPARERS AND COSTUME DESIGNERS MADE JUNETEENTH. CELEBRATIONS POSSIBLE. JUNETEENTH IS A SALAD OF THE FREEDOMS FOR WHICH CATALYST BLACK WOMEN HAVE FOUGHT. POET ABOLITIONIST ORATOR AND SUFFRAGISTS FRANCIS E. W. HARPER URGE WHITE SUFFRAGISTS TO STAND UP FOR THE BLACK SISTERS UPON HEARING THE WORDS ALL PEOPLE ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL IN THE MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTION ELISABET MONTH AT FREEMAN HIRED A LAWYER AND WORK THROUGH. THE COURT SYSTEM TO EARN HER FREEDOM. THEY PAVE THE WAY FOR THE BLACK WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICAL AND CRUCIAL TO ADVANCING CULTURE. FEMINISM CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY THE WOMEN LIKE ACTIVIST ANGELA DAVIS AUTHOR ALICE WALKER AND OUR COUNTRY'S VICE PRESIDENT KHAMA HARRIS HAVE ALL BEEN UPLIFTED BY THOSE STRUGGLES. JUNETEENTH IS A TIME OF CELEBRATION BUT ALSO HAS A STRONG REMINDER THAT THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IS NOT OVER. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. WE HAVE YET TO ACHIEVE EQUITY FOR BLACK WOMEN IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND JUSTICE SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN WE MUST NEVER FORGET THE DARK HISTORY SO WE CAN ENSURE IT'S NEVER REPEATED AGAIN AND WITH THAT I APPROACH YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M PRESIDENT- I RISE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS- AND- INDIVIDUALLY- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SCR- FORTY ONE- AND I HOPE THAT ARE UNLIKE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WE CAN MAKE THIS VOTE UNANIMOUS TODAY IT WAS TRAGIC THAT THERE WERE- SOME MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO CHOSE TO VOTE AGAINST MAKING JUNETEENTH A FEDERAL HOLIDAY- YOU KNOW VERY SIMILAR TO THE RESISTANCE WE THOUGHT OF MAKING MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. ON A FEDERAL HOLIDAY AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE IT UNANIMOUS TODAY AND SO THAT WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN- THAT- DEFENSIVE PASS BY YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE JEWISH TRADITION WE HAVE A CONCEPT CALLED TIKKUN OLAM HEALING THE WORLD- AND WHAT A KNOWLEDGE IS THAT- EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE SURFACE AND DID- WHETHER IT'S INCITEMENT OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN EGYPT OR THE ENSLAVEMENT- BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S A GREAT THING AND THOSE HORRIBLE WRONGS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TO ALSO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TODAY AND SEE WHAT LINGERS TODAY- AND HOW WE CAN FIX THAT HOW WE CAN HEAL THE WORLD. AND ALTHOUGH SLAVERY ENDED- YOU'RE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO- WE NOTE THAT THE VESTIGES OF SLAVERY CONTINUE UNTIL TODAY WE HAVE THE MODERN DAY JIM CROW OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHICH WE SEE THAT IT IS CLEAR THE DAY IS LONG THE IMPACTS THAT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS HAVING ON. OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY ON OUR BLACK COMMUNITIES- IN TERMS OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE POLICING. DISPROPORTIONATE KILLING. A BLACK MAN IN PARTICULAR DISPROPORTIONATE. INCARCERATION OF BLACK PEOPLE. DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS. RESULTING IN PART FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS A STAIN ON OUR SOCIETY THAT LINGERS A HUNDRED MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS LATER AND WE HAVE NOT DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. DEFECTS ARE AND TO END A TERRIBLE INJUSTICE. WE CONTINUE TO SEE AND WE SEE IT AROUND THE COUNTRY TODAY. ACTIVE MOVEMENTS IN STATE LEGISLATURES AROUND THIS COUNTRY. TO TRY TO PREVENT BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM VOTING. TO MAKE IT HARDER AND WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT FOR WHAT IT IS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR BLACK PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. TO VOTE WHEN WE SAW THE CHALLENGES THE LAST ELECTION. THE CHALLENGES IN A STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA OR IN MICHIGAN OR GEORGIA OR WHATEVER ELSE. THEY WEREN'T CHALLENGING THE VOTING RESULTS IN THE WHITE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES. THEY SPECIFICALLY WERE CHALLENGING THE VOTES. IN AREAS IN CITIES WITH HIGH BLACK POPULATIONS. WHEN YOU HAD THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE REPRESENTATIVES WHO WERE CLAIMING THAT THEY WANTED TO OVERTURN THAT PENNSYLVANIA RESULTS WELL THAT THAT'S THERE YOU WOULD THINK WITHOUT YOUR OWN ELECTIONS YOU WERE ELECTED. BY THE VOTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA BUT THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT THEIR VOTERS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT PHILADELPHIA OR PITTSBURGH AREAS WHERE A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE WERE VOTING. SO WE NEED TO CALL THIS OUT FOR WHAT IT IS IT'S DESPICABLE AND IT IS STILL HERE TODAY SO LET'S CELEBRATE JUNETEENTH. THE END OF SLAVERY. WAS JUST AN AMAZING STEP FOR THIS COUNTRY. BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING IN THE MIRROR ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY. CALL IT OUT AND PUT AN END TO IT THANK YOU. SENATOR CASEY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SCR FORTY ONE IN HONOR OF JUNETEENTH WHAT'S YOUR ROLE SERVING ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE TOOK A HISTORIC STEP TOWARD INCLUSIVITY BY BECOMING THE FIRST COUNTY IN THE STATE TO MAKE JUNETEENTH OUR NATION'S OLDEST COMMEMORATION OF THE ENDING OF SLAVERY A PAID HOLIDAY FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. THIS PROPOSAL CAME AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY REGARDING RACE EQUITY. AND SYSTEMIC CHANGE. DURING THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF ALL THE DOUBT OF GEORGE FORD. NOW WITH CONGRESS THE FOLLOWING LEAD OF MANY COUNTIES AND STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN PASSING THE BILL THIS WEEK. AS WE ALL KNOW WILL WE WILL SOON HAVE JUNETEENTH AS A FEDERAL PUBLIC HOLIDAY ACROSS OUR NATION PERHAPS. BUT WITH THE SIGNATURE BY THE PRESIDENT AS EARLY AS TODAY. WHILE SLAVERY WAS ENDED. THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC RACIAL INEQUALITY STILL PERMEATE OUR COMMUNITIES WE'VE HEARD THAT. FROM SO MANY TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHORS ALL OF THE AUTHORS OF PARTICULAR COLLEAGUE. FROM LOS ANGELES. HE HAD DONE I WANT COLLEAGUES AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENIA- AND ALSO- WANT TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. WHO INDICATED I THOUGHT- CLEARLY- ONE OF THE- FOR PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE HAD. AS WE JOYFULLY SHOWED UP FOR JUNETEENTH CELEBRATIONS IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND ITS PEOPLE DID THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. KNOWING KNOWING. THAT WE WERE CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH BUT WITHOUT THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR OWN STATE OUR OWN CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE IN POPULATION. THAT WE WOULD GIVE OF JULY. TO CELEBRATE THE LIBERATION OF THE THIRTEEN COLONIES IN THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT HAPPENED EARLIER IT IS ALWAYS STRUCK ME TO BE A SLAP IN THE FACE. PARTICULARLY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IN THIS COUNTRY THAN IN MY OWN DISTRICT. BUT TO SAY WE WILL CELEBRATE JUNETEENTH. BUT YOU DON'T GET THE SAME RESPECT ON THAT DAY THAT THE REST OF AMERICANS. CELEBRATE ON JULY FOURTH AND- I ALSO WANT TO INDICATE- THAT WERE NOT DONE THIS IS A GREAT STEP TOWARD TRUE EQUITY IN REPRESENTATION AND I DO THINK IT INDICATES. FARM PROBABLY AS STRONGLY AS ANYTHING AS INDICATED IN MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE THINGS CAN CHANGE- BUT A LOT MORE HAS TO CHANGE. MY GOOD FRIEND. WHO GREW UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD TO ME THE N. DOUBLE ACP ROBIN JEFF MORE PACKED UP HIS BELONGINGS. TWO DAYS AGO. N. AS FAMILY AND DROVE ACROSS COUNTRY TO LEAVE HIS HOME TOWN TO MOVE TO ATLANTA. INDICATING THAT HIS HOME TOWN WAS NO LONGER WELCOME ME TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING I TAKE VRY SERIOUSLY AND THOUGH THIS IS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TRUE I COULD BE OBVIOUSLY- IS STILL- SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO REACH FOR THANK YOU AND I URGE EVERYONE SUPPORT FOR A C. R. FORTY ONE. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM ALLY OF FOR HER ELOQUENT WORDS AS CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE. RAISE YOUR VOICE TODAY TO SPEAK TO THIS IMPORTANT. HISTORICAL MEASURE A HOLIDAY THAT MANY OF YOU HERE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE- I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER HAVING A JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE SAYS THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE EVER HEARD OF IT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL THE END TELL ME MORE. AND IT ONLY LENDS ITSELF TO THE CONTINUED MISEDUCATION. OF NOT ONLY THE NEGRO BUT AMERICA ITSELF THE CONTINUING WHITEWASHING AND CONTINUED LIES A WHAT AMERICA REALLY IS IN WHO AMERICA REALLY IS. JUNE THIRTEENTH IS IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY BECAUSE MY ENTIRE FAMILY IS FROM TEXAS I GREW UP WITH A FATHER WHO IS ADAMANT ABOUT CELEBRATING JUNE EIGHTEENTH. THE LAST TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE WENT BACK TO TEXAS EVERY YEAR IN JUNE AND SPENT THE ENTIRE MONTH OF JUNE AND TEXAS CELEBRATING. ANY INSTILLED IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF US THE IMPORTANCE OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH NOT FOR THE JULY BUT JUNETEENTH. AND IF YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY THERE ARE THREE THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH JUNETEENTH. WATERMELON RED SODA POP IN RED VELVET CAKE. AND THEIR RACIAL STEREOTYPES AFTER AMERICANS LIKE WATER NO MORE NO WE DON'T THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT WAS BECAUSE OF JUNETEENTH. AND THE RED REPRESENTED THE BLOOD THAT WE SHE ADDED FOR THIS COUNTRY AS SLAVES AS PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY AND IT SIGNIFIES THE BLOOD THAT WE LOST AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS RED SODA OP THAT'S WHY WITH WATERMELON AND THAT'S WHY WITH RED VELVET CAKE. THE RECOGNIZE THE BLOOD THAT WE SHED. IT TOOK ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF BONDAGE. STARTING IN NINETEEN I MEAN SIXTEEN NINETEEN FOR AMERICA TO FINALLY ABOLISHED SLAVERY. IT WAS A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH AS THE ENDING OF SLAVERY. AND AS WE CELEBRATE NOT ONLY. IN TEXAS BUT IT WAS ALSO IN LOUISIANA THEY GOT THE WORD LATE TOO AS THEY MIGRATED WEST TO DO TO BRING THE MESSAGE BUT THE BONDAGE IN REMNANTS OF SLAVERY STILL EXISTS TODAY IN THIS COUNTRY AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO SO ELOQUENTLY STATED. ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE SUFFER FROM THE MOST THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THE EDUCATION THE LACK OF EDUCATION. THE HOMELESSNESS. THAT MASS INCARCERATION THE CALL CENTER ON RACE WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES IF WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SOLVING THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE WE SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION HOW CAN 13% OF THE POPULATION REPRESENT 50% OF HOMELESSNESS THE RACE IS NOT AT THE CORE OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY. HOW CAN THE GREATEST HEALTH DISPARITIES. IMPACT PEOPLE OF COLOR IT RAISES NOT THE PART OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO SO WE'RE REALLY ABOUT CHANGING THIS COUNTRY WE NEED TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE AND I'M HONORED THAT. R. U. S. CONGRESS VOTED YESTERDAY AND THAT OUR PRESIDENT SHOULD PUT A SIGNATURE TODAY. ARE RECOGNIZING JUNETEENTH AS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY IT'S REALLY A STORK BEAT FOR THIS COUNTRY BUT AGAIN I HOPE IT'S JUST NOT. N. WORDS ONLY IT HAS TO BE AN ACTION IN THE WORDS OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES BUT THE SILENCE OF OUR FRIENDS IT'S TOO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS SILENT ON THE REAL ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. HERE IN THE STATE- AND AGAIN DESPITE. WHAT WE'RE DOING ACROSS- MEANS CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH AS STATED. WE HAVE STATES ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. WHO WANT TO DENY THE CONVERSATION. OF SLAVERY. AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY WE WANT TO REMOVE IT FROM OUR SCHOOLS. THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING IT THE MOST THE EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION SO THEY KNOW THE TRUE. STORY OF AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS YEAR ON JUNE EIGHTEENTH WILL REFLECT THE TENACITY AND RESOLVE THAT IS PRESENT IN THE CHARACTER OF ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS. THE WAY WE WILL OVERCOME GREAT OBSTACLES IN THIS DARK PATH WE ARE STILL IN THE PURSUIT OF TRUE FREEDOM. FREEDOM TO BE OUR TRUE SELVES OUR MOST AUTHENTIC BLACK SELVES WITHOUT BEING THREATENED. AND BEING UNAPOLOGETIC FOR WHO WE ARE I STAND HERE ON APOLOGETIC AS A BLACK MAN IN THIS COUNTRY AND I SEE YOU BEFORE I VOTE. ON S. C. FORTY ONE RECOGNIZING JUNETEENTH NOT ONLY AS A STATE HOLIDAY BUT HOPEFULLY I MEAN AS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. BY THE END OF THE DAY THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.
