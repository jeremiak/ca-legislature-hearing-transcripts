TECHNOLOGICALLY. THAT THEY WERE

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:20.818
READY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:23.955
THIS KIND OF. ADDITIONAL

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.924
INCREASE IN WORK AND THEY

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.859
CLEARLY HAVE DONE SO NOW AND

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.427
CLEARLY WE'VE SEEN AS A RESULT

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.361
OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.096

WHICH WERE IN SO WE DID A BOND

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:19.837
MEASURE TO GET ELIMINATE THOSE

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.873

WORKING FOR THE GOVERNOR- THAT

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.938
WE MADE AN EFFORT IN OUR

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.940
LEGISLATION- IN OUR FIRST YEAR

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.942

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.994
THINK WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.228
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A PROCESS

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:53.030

STATE AND OUR REGISTRARS FROM

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.038
AROUND THE STATE WHO DID SUCH A

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.973
MARVELOUS JOB IN THIS ELECTION

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.242
SEASON I TO GET THE BALLOTS OUT

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:07.678
TO SO MANY AND HAVE THIS GREAT

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:08.379

REALLY IS A- A GREAT HALLMARK

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:13.884
OF THEIR SERVICE. AND I KNOW

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.152
THAT THE SENATE. YOUR EFFORTS

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.520
ARE TO CONTINUE THAT TO MAKE

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.189
SURE THAT IN THIS. YEAR THAT

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:20.124
WE'RE IN NOW TWENTY TWENTY ONE-

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.625
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE THAT

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.895
HEALTHY ONE FOR INCLUDING AN

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.897
INCREASING- TURNED OUT I THINK

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.666
THAT. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.367
TO DO THAT AT THIS YEAR AS WE-

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.936
AGAIN TRY TO LEARN FROM THE

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:34.071
PROCESS SEE WERE WE- CAN DO IT

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.373
BETTER. I DO NOTE THAT THE THAT

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.675
THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:38.809
SOME ISSUES THERE ARE ALWAYS

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.045
ISSUES- BUT NONE OF IT. NONE OF

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.848
THEM- WITH ANY AT THAT SIZE OR

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.317
ANY- IMPACT ON ANY OF THE RACES

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.218
IN THE STATE WE CAN ALWAYS LOOK

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:49.019
FOR WAYS TO DO BETTER. I WOULD

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:50.554
INVITE THIS MOCK REPRESENTING

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.922
THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:53.991
TO. TAKE THOSE CONCERNS TO

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:54.692
HEART AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD
