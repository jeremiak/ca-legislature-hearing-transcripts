CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO OVER SIX POINT THREE MILLION ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICANS THE LARGEST POPULATION. IN THE COUNTRY. MOREOVER ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICANS ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AT THE POPULATIONS IN THE STATE. AND NATION. FROM CHINESE LABORERS WHO CAME IN THE MID TO LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO WORK THE GOLD MINES AND HELP BUILD THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. TO SOUTH ASIANS TO IMMIGRATE TO WORK IN THE WEST GROWING AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY DURING THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. TO THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT BROUGHT MUCH OF OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO CALIFORNIA IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. API HISTORY IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AND BY APPARENTLY RICH. WALL API COMMUNITIES SOUGHT REFUGE OR IMMIGRATED HERE DURING DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN THE UNITED STATES WERE SIMILAR. MANY OF WHICH STEMMED FROM POLICIES ENACTED BY LAWMAKERS DURING THAT TIME. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO PROHIBITED CHINESE LABORS FROM ENTERING THIS COUNTRY. AT A LATER AMENDMENT IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR EXPANDED THIS LAW AND BARRED ALL INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL ASIAN COUNTRIES. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS XENA PHOBIC ALIEN LAND LAWS PREVENTED CHINESE INDIAN JAPANESE AND KOREAN FARMERS FROM OWNING FARMS. IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE U. S. CONGRESS ADOPTED THE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IMMIGRATION ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ASIATIC BARRED ZONE ACT. WHICH PROHIBITED MANY FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. FROM IMMIGRATING. TO THE UNITED STATES. THESE EXAMPLES FROM OUR SHARED HISTORY ARE IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING HOW IT HAS SHAPED OUR ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES TODAY. AND IS SERVED AS A REMINDER OF THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR LEGISLATIVE BODIES. IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES. API A COMMUNITIES DEVELOP THEIR OWN SERVICES IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND AT THE COMMUNITIES LIKE LITTLE SAIGON IN SAN JOSE AND MOST RESULT MOST RECENTLY IN SAN DIEGO. THEY ORGANIZE FILIPINO AMERICAN FARMWORKERS WHO FOUGHT FOR WORKERS RIGHTS AS PART OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES.

A HOSPITAL'S DECISION TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICES CREATE SERIOUS IS SERIOUS CHALLENGES FOR A COMMUNITY. IN MY DISTRICT JUST LAST YEAR THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF LONG BEACH CLOSED ITS DOORS. AFTER ABRUPTLY DIVERTING EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS TO OTHER HOSPITALS THIS WAS DONE WITH VERY LITTLE NOTICE TO RESIDENTS AND THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN CONTINUES THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK IN INCREASING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL INCREASES LOCAL CONTROL BY ELIMINATING LOOPHOLES IN THE CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT. THIS BILL RESTORES THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND CLARIFIES THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF DULY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR ROLE IN PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. AB FIFTY NO SEVEN SIX TO ADDRESS CONSISTENT AN ONGOING CHALLENGES THAT LEAVE IMPACTED DISTRICTS WITH NO RECOURSE OTHER THAN COSTLY LITIGATION. ELEAZAR TASKED WITH ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS WITHOUT SUCCESS IS BUILT OFF TRUST FROM THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY AND THE COMMUNITY THAT IS IMPACTED BY IT. THIS WAS THE CASE IN MY TENURE ON THE NEW HALL SCHOOL BOARD WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS NORTH ALREADY TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT ON A SCHOOL THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT WAS PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE COULD NOT DO ARE DULY ELECTED JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS WERE THE FAMILIES IN THE SCHOOL NOR COULD WE ADVOCATE FOR ANY MITIGATING FACTORS TO DECREASE THE IMPACT ON THAT SCHOOLS NEIGHBORS.

AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED BY THE MULTIPLE ELLIE ETS WHO WOULD CAREFULLY VETTED AND DENIED THEIR ORIGINAL PETITION. THE AUTHORIZED OR IN THIS CASE WAS A SMALL RURAL RURAL DISTRICT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DUE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT. THIS IS OCCURRING IN DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE LOOPHOLE IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCESSIBLE RIVERSIDE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR STRUGGLING ELEAZAR IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT NOT ONLY WITH THE INTENT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. BUT WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADEQUATELY FUND ALL DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT. THE COST OF OPERATION DON'T DIMINISH IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO EIGHTY A ALLOCATION. AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TOOLS AND THE POWER TO BEST UTILIZE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND CHILDREN.

OVER ALMOST 90% OF THE STUDENTS ARE LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND ABOUT 96% OF THE GRADUATING SENIORS WERE ACCEPTED BY A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. HOWEVER THEY ARE FACING GO A ONE ISSUE WHERE THEY WERE CHARTERED. AND AND AUTHORIZED IN INGLEWOOD BUT THEY HAD TO MOVE THEIR SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FACILITIES. TO LESS WITHIN A MILE. TO THE CITY OF GARDENA -- I IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR. HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS AND IS CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXECUTE THE INTENT. OF PROPER OVERSIGHT AND CRACKING DOWN ON BAD CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT MAKING SURE. THAT WE ARE MAKING COMMONSENSE AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO GOOD CHARTER SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE.

SOME OF THEM ARE OUT THERE DOING REALLY WONDERFUL AND MIRACULOUS THINGS. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ACT WAS FOR CHARTERS TO BE EXACTLY THAT. LABORATORIES OF LEARNING THAT WOULD THEN CREATE A FEEDBACK LOOP SYSTEMIC TO OUR GREATER PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM TO ENHANCE THE LEARNING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY STUDENT.

ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE FIREFIGHTERS ELIGIBILITY FOR PRESUMPTIVE COVERAGE IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE. THESE CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES SERVING COUNTY FIRE SERVICE OUTFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEIR FIRE MECHANICS FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANICS AND OTHER MECHANIC WORKERS. THEY REPAIR AND MAINTAIN FIRE SERVICE VEHICLES SUCH AS FIRE TRUCKS ARE HELICOPTERS AND THE EQUIPMENT USED BY FIRE FIGHTERS TO BATTLE ACTIVE BLAZE. THE RIGORS OF THESE WORKERS DAILY WORK INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF EXPOSURE. TO SUCH CARCINOGENS SUCH AS BENZENE CHLOROFORM SUIT STYRENE AND FORMALDEHYDE AMONG OTHER CONTAMINANTS. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE INHERENTLY IN HEALTH IN DANGER MEANT THEY FACE RISKS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY EVEN HIGHER FOR SOME SPECIFIC TYPES OF CANCERS.

THE FIRE -- MECHANICS DO THEIR JOBS WITH LIMITED STANDARD ISSUE PHYSICAL PROTECTIVE GEAR ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE THE MECHANICS WILL BE WORKING ON VEHICLES OR EQUIPMENT. THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A DIG DECONTAMINATION PROCESS PRIOR TO THE START OF THEIR WORK. AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN FIREFIGHTERS RETURN FROM FIGHTING A FIRE.

IT IS CRITICAL THAT ATTORNEYS JUDGES AND COURT PERSONNEL RECEIVE TRAINING ON A ROUTINE BASIS TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS SEASON TAKES STEPS TO COUNTER ACT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ENTER INTO A COURT ROOM YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR LIFE. YOUR TRUST AND SOMETIMES YOUR FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT AND WE KNOW.
