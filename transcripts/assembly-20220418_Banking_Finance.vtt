00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.690
ISSUE WITH THE TYPICAL MODELS TO

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.325
WHAT SAFEGUARDS EXIST IN THIS

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:12.897
BILL. TO ENSURE THAT THIS. DOES

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.398

POPULATIONS AS A FAIR QUESTION I

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.240
THINK I HAVE SEEN AND I'M NOT A

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:24.842
HUGELY TECHNOLOGICAL PERSON I

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:27.278
ADMIT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO. FUSE

THE CHIME APP KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:32.750
DOING BUT I HAVE SEEN. FINTECH

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.919
MODELS WHICH HAVE A VARIETY OF

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:37.855
PSYCHOLOGICAL COERCION INVOLVED

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:40.124
LIKE A LITTLE PERSON WILL GET

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.928
MORE HAPPY AS YOU TIP. CURRENTLY

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.296
IT WILL THROTTLE DOWN THE

SERVICE OR GIVE YOU MORE SERVICE

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:49.833
LATER IF THERE IS A HISTORY OF

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.369
TIPPING SELL THIS ESTABLISHES

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:55.172
THAT YOU MAY NOT IN ANY WAY

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.107
ENHANCE THEIR PERFORMANCE OR THE

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.176
SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO TIP OR

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.611
DEGRADE IT FROM PEOPLE WHO

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.613
DON'T. IT HAPPENS THAT THE

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.481
DECISION TO TIP IS AFTER YOU'VE

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:06.483
RECEIVED THE SERVICE AND THE

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.353
SPOT ME SERVICE- IT HAS TO

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.622

CAN HAVE YOUR MONEY BACK. THE

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.765
ONE THING I DISAGREE

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.067
RESPECTFULLY WITH THE OPPOSITION

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.369
IS THEY TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.038
POSSIBLE TO DEFINE VOLUNTARY AND

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.040
I THINK WE DO. WE DEFINE

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.509
DIFFICULT TERMS ALL THE TIME. IN

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.878
HIS BODY AND TO ME THOSE ARE

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:38.115
INDEED CHAU VOLUNTARINESS AND IF

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:38.749
THERE'S SOME OTHER THAT WE CAN

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:41.518
CONSIDER. HAPPY TO DO IT AND

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:44.088
JUST TO FOLLOW UP. ON A MEMBER

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:44.989
BE GENEROUS AMOUNT OF YOU. HAD A

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:49.026
CHANCE TO SEE THIS- SCREENSHOT.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:51.595
OVERTIME IT'S AS IF YOU LEAVE A

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.497
TIP FOR SPOT ME WE SPOTTED YOU

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.565
TWENTY DOLLARS WITHOUT FEES AND

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:56.367
THEN THERE FOR BOXES 5% AND THE

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:59.570
TIP 10% 215% TIP NO TIP ALL ALL

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.538
CLEARLY. LABELLED AND THEN IT

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.807
SAYS WHETHER YOU TIP OR NOT HAS

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.509
NO IMPACT ON YOUR SPOT ME

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.311
ELIGIBILITY OR LIMITS- SO YOU

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:10.381
KNOW I THINK THIS IS A CLEAR WAY

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:11.915
WHERE. YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:14.184
SOMEBODY INTO TIPPING YOU'RE NOT

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.486
TRICKING SOMEBODY INTO BELIEVING

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:17.654
THAT THEY HAVE TO TIP FOR IT TO

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.655
CONTINUE RECEIVING THE SERVICE.

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.591
AND WE I AM MORE THAN OPEN TO

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.092
OTHER IDEAS THAT THAT THE

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.361
OPPOSITION HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:26.196
IT'S CLEAR IN THE BILL. THE KIND

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.532
OF STEPS THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO-

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:31.068
DID IT TO HAVE A TIPPING OPTION

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:34.071
OR OR NOT- BUT YOU. YEAH I MEAN

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:36.006
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ME I'D- I'D

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.174
RUN CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.209
ALL THE TIME ABOUT ANOTHER ONE

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:43.881
THIS YEAR- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MY

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.716
INTENTION AT ALL TO. ALLOW FIRST

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:46.817
THAT PEOPLE. INTO PAYING

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:47.451
SOMETHING- THAT THEY DON'T WANT

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.119
TO- BUT THIS IS A WAY O.

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.422
PROVIDE THEM AN OPTION- YOU KNOW

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:53.857
WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVING AT THE

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:55.259
FEET. A SERVICE WITHOUT A FEE

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:56.693
AND A SERVICE THAT IF THEY WRITE

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.161
A TRADITIONAL BANKING

00:44:57.227 --> 00:45:00.230
INSTITUTION WOULD PROBABLY AND

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.498
INVOLVE A HEFTY OVERDRAFT FEE.

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.666
AND I CERTAINLY AND I THINK THE

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:05.102
OPPOSITION AND IT I THINK. IT

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:07.471
KNOWLEDGE AND THE YOUR INTENT

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.373
AND SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.808
ABOUT THAT ANYONE'S CONCERNED

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:13.677
ABOUT YOUR INTENT OR- IF ANYONE

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.279
QUESTIONING YOUR YOUR RECORD AS

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:18.015
A- CONSUMER ADVOCATE AND- YEAH.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:20.451
OF COURSE YES. BUT I THINK WITH

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:21.819
SO MANY THINGS THAT WE DO THERE

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:24.521
ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.623
I THINK THAT WOULD. THAT'S MY-

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.926
QUESTION AND AS I SAID IT'S IN

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.961
I'M STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:33.497
AROUND- YEAH MY PERSPECTIVE ON

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:36.100
TO BEING PARTICULARLY. WITH THIS

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.534
KIND OF A MARKET SO I THINK

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.769
AGAIN IN YOUR- IN YOUR OPENING

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:43.040
YOU SAID THAT. AT 70% OF YOUR

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.708
CUSTOMERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:46.543
LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.745
THESE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.214
CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.549
CALIFORNIA AND SADLY. THEY ARE

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:53.550
SOME OF THE LEAST FINANCIALLY

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:55.619
SAVVY CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.588
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY. THEY

00:45:57.654 --> 00:46:00.224
ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO COERCION

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.025
EXPLOITATION AND FRANKLY JUST

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.261
BEING CONFUSED AS TO LIKE WAIT

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.863
TO I REALLY GET THIS THING AGAIN

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:07.865
IF I DON'T KEPT THEM SO. I THINK

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.067
THAT'S KIND OF THE ROOT OF MY-

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:12.136
CONCERNS NOT ABOUT THIS COMPANY

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.871
SPECIFICALLY BUT THE FACT IT.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:17.407
DOES THIS THEN. OPEN THE DOOR TO

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.676
BAT PREDATORY LENDERS WHEN YOU

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:22.045
KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THOSE

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:22.980
FOLKS EXCESS. I'M TO TAKE

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:26.016
ADVANTAGE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:28.519
HAVE MADE HERE. TO AND I THINK

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.786
THAT ONE OF THE OPPOSITION FOLKS

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:32.256
SAID THAT IT YEAH UNDERCUTS THE

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:32.856
LAWS THAT ARE INTENDED TO CAP

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.625
INTEREST RATES AND PROTECT.

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.560
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SO. I'M I

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.895

ADDRESS THAT CONCERN AND THEN. I

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.632
WOULD ALSO LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:42.633
OPPOSITION I KNOW THE OTHER JUST

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.468
SAID YOU'RE OPEN TO IDEAS IN

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.769
TERMS OF SOME SPECIFIC.

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.004
PROTECTIONS THAT POTENTIALLY

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.139
COULD MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE.

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:54.278
WITH. A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS.

00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:56.413
THROUGH THE CHAIR PLUS. SO IT

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.049
DOES REQUIRE THAT THE- RIRE TO

PAYCHECK AND- I THINK THAT'S A

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.775
TESTAMENT TO CHIME AND THEIR

00:47:58.842 --> 00:47:59.610

CREATED A NEW OPTION FOR THEM

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.095
WITHOUT THE FEES THAT THE

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:18.662
TRADITIONAL BANKING OPTIONS

SOMETHING OVER TWENTY A POINT

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.477
HERE THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:58.047
GET INTO THE- NITTY GRITTY

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.081
DETAILS AS TO WHY LENDERS MAKING

FINANCING THAT THAT'S THE

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.890
PURPOSE OF THAT FINANCING- IF

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.959
YOU WERE TO GO TO SAY A LOCAL

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.327

BANKING INSTITUTION IS- THEY'RE

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:16.498
NOT GOING TO ASK IN THIS

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.332
PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND SO

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:18.801
THERE'S NOT A NECESSARILY THAT

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:20.569
SAME LEVEL OF- HAVING GAUGE

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.904

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.139
TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE ASKING

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:25.774

THAT CAN HAPPEN TO FOR LINE ON

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.018
ONE DOCUMENT. SO I MEAN I THINK

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.453
THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.053
SEPARATELY IF YOU'RE TALKING

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.421
ABOUT A CONSUMER WANTING TO LIE

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:41.557
IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS AT THE

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.791
CONSUMER. LINE ON A MORTGAGE

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.126
DOCUMENT WHATEVER ELSE THERE'S

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.527
REMEDIES THAT. WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:46.995
THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR ATTEMPTING

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:48.464
TO BREAK THE LAW DO SOMETHING

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.265
DISHONEST IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:50.899

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.134
SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.703
OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW THE%

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.071
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT AT THIS BILL

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:58.841
WILL DO BUT THEY SENT. THE THAT

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:02.177
WHEN. WHEN CONSUMER- MAKES A

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.546
LOAN. TO PURCHASE A PATH THAT

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:07.182
THE PETS ARE NOT GONNA BE

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:07.883
COLLATERAL. WHEN YOU BUY A

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.018
HOUSE. THE HOUSE IS A COLLATERAL

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:12.387
SO WE NORTH AND THEN THE EXACTLY

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:16.358
KNOWLES. SO THAT'S WHY. HOW HOW

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.360
IS E IT WOULD HOW ABOUT DOCTOR

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.130
CHOI IF I MAY I THINK WITH THE

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:21.597
BILL ADDRESSES IS THE

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.499
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A LENDER

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.800
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THE

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:28.370
RETAILER. OF THE OF THE PET. AND

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:31.006
SO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.775
THERE CAN'T BE THIS RELATIONSHIP

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.710
OF A RETAILER SOLELY GIVING

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.845
LOANS OUT. AT THE TIME OF

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.081
PURCHASE OF A PET IS THAT. HOW I

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:42.184

LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:43.985
COURT. THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:46.154
QUOTE BECAUSE THE STATUTE TREATS

THE SIMILARLY SITUATED

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.558

CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. I THINK

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.512

COMMITTEE TO BE HAVING THIS

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:07.246
CONVERSATION TO BE TALKING

01:58:07.313 --> 01:58:08.848
ABOUT. CRYPTO CURRENCY IN AND

01:58:08.915 --> 01:58:12.685
REALLY HOW. WE START TO LOOK AT.

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:14.353
OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE THE

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.923
FINANCING SYSTEM I DO BELIEVE

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:17.723
THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS THE

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:20.860
ABILITY. TO BE BENEFICIAL LONG

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:23.095
TERM IN THAT IT CAN REALLY

01:58:23.162 --> 01:58:25.264
CHANGE THE WAY THAT THE- PAYMENT

01:58:25.331 --> 01:58:27.800
SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:28.668
THE YEARS WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.870
REASONS BUT A LOT OF PUSHBACK. A

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.138
CRYPTOCURRENCY BECAUSE IT IT

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:33.706
WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE

01:58:33.773 --> 01:58:35.575
OUT THAT LITTLE 3% THAT'S THERE

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.910
THAT WE THAT. MERCHANTS ACTUALLY

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:40.980
END UP PAYING FOR ALL ALONG THE

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:44.717
WAY. HOWEVER I'D I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:46.419
THIS BILL AND I'M HOPING THAT IT

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:48.821
DOESN'T COME UP PREMATURELY AND

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:50.356
DAMAGE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:51.958
LONGER TERM CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:54.026
CRYPTOCURRENCY AND THE REASON

01:58:54.093 --> 01:58:56.028
REALLY IS THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:57.096
RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING FOR

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.665
LEGITIMACY. AS THEY SHOULD BE

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:01.400
AND THIS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:03.803
CREATE SOME SEMBLANCE OF

01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:06.472
LEGITIMACY AS THEY TRY AND WRK

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:09.475
OUT. WHAT THE- HOW

01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:10.309
CRYPTOCURRENCY ULTIMATELY CAN

01:59:10.376 --> 01:59:13.012
FUNCTION IN OVERALL IN IN A

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:15.982
PAYMENT SYSTEM. AND IF PRIVATE

01:59:16.048 --> 01:59:17.717
COMPANIES WANT TO TAKE THE RISK

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:20.286
OF THE VOLATILITY AND WHAT

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:21.287
CRYPTOCURRENCY DOES OUR MEANS

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.855
THAT THEY CAN DO THAT THE

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:25.324
PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:27.126
AS REGULATORY REGULATORS BOTH

01:59:27.193 --> 01:59:28.628
THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:29.695
REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:31.931
REGULATORS A CURRENCY OR REGULAR

01:59:31.998 --> 01:59:32.598
HIS SECURITY OR WHAT TO DO

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:34.567
AROUND. AND UNTIL SOME OF THOSE

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:37.203
DECISIONS ARE MADE THERE IS NOT

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.638
APPROPRIATE CONSUMER PART A

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.072
COULD PROPER CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:59:40.139 --> 01:59:42.074
FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH TO

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:44.844
PROTECT THE CONSUMERS NOW LET'S

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.712
TALK ABOUT WITH THIS BILL DOES

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:47.847
WITH RESPECT TO CITIES AND

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:50.516
COUNTIES WHO ARE AND HAVE BEEN

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:52.218
FOR A LONG TIME REALLY CASH

01:59:52.285 --> 01:59:53.319
STRAPPED. AND IF WE OPEN UP THIS

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.121
IN IN PROVIDE SOME LEGITIMACY MY

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.889
WORRY IS THAT SOME OF THESE

01:59:56.956 --> 01:59:58.124
ENTITIES WOULD GO AND DO JUST

01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.226
THAT AND NOW START TAKING CRYPTO

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:02.528
CURRENCIES IN TAKING ON THE RISK

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.764
OF THE VOLATILITY OF THOSE

02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:06.566
CURRENCIES REPRESENTS. THEY

02:00:06.632 --> 02:00:08.534
THEIR THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY THAT

02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:10.636
THEY'RE MANAGING. AND IF ALL OF

02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:12.872
A SUDDEN GIVEN THE FLUCTUATIONS

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:15.007
IN THE CURRENCY. A LOCAL

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:16.442
JURISDICTIONS COFFERS OF THE

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:17.810
WEEK COUNTIES COLLECT MONEY

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:20.479
COUNTIES COLLECT MONEY. NOT ONLY

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:22.315
FOR THE COUNTY BUT FOR A LOT OF

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:24.584
THE- AGENCIES IN THAT COUNTIES

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:26.319
CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AT

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.853
ALL. AND IF THAT FUN NOW IS

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.455
BASED TO SOME EXTENT OF CRYPTO

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:31.223
CURRENCY IN THE WRIST THAT THAT

02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:32.558
REPRESENTS. AND THERE THAT

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:34.827
VOLATILITY GOES NEGATIVE. THOSE

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.829
ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IN

02:00:36.896 --> 02:00:38.798
A WORLD OF HURT. AND THEY'RE

02:00:38.864 --> 02:00:39.732
GONNA BE LOOKING THEN TO US THE

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.368
STATE TO TRY AND HELP SOLVE THIS

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:43.769
AND BEAR THIS OUT. I JUST DON'T

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:44.971
SEE HOW ULTIMATELY HOW THIS IS

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.973
WORKABLE RIGHT NOW. THAT I THINK

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:48.374
THIS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO FROM A

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:50.343
GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT INSTEAD OF

02:00:50.409 --> 02:00:52.912
GETTING GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE THE

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:54.413
- BEING. WILLING TO TAKE THE

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:55.948
VOLATILITY RISK THAT CRYPTO

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:58.551
CURRENCIES MEAN. IF WE CAN GET

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.453
TO A FRAMEWORK THAT ESTABLISHES

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:01.787
WHETHER IT'S A CURRENCY WHETHER

02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:03.289
IT'S A SECURITY HOWEVER THAT

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.991
DECISIONS GOING TO COME DOWN.

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:07.293
MANAGE THAT AND THEN WE CAN GO

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.561
THROUGH THAT PROVIDE ULTIMATELY

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:10.963
SOME STABILITY. IN THESE MARKETS

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:12.798
WE'D BE ON A MUCH BETTER TRACK

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.834
TO DO THAT SO I DO NOT WANT TO

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.736
DO ANYTHING TO QUASH THE

02:01:16.802 --> 02:01:18.537
DISCUSSION HERE. BUT I'M VERY

02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:22.074
LEERY OF. SENDING WRONG SIGNALS

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:24.543
OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:25.811
BE THEY SPECIAL DISTRICTS CITIES

02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:27.380
OR COUNTIES. THAT MAY WANT TO

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.615
START TO ADOPT THIS. IF THEY DO

02:01:29.682 --> 02:01:31.317
AND TAKE THE RISK THAT'S BETWEEN

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:32.385
THEM AND THEIR TAXPAYERS

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:34.020
ALTHOUGH I SAY THAT WITH A

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.921
LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION. BECAUSE

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:37.690
ULTIMATELY THEY'RE GONNA COME TO

02:01:37.757 --> 02:01:38.891
US COUNTIES ARE ARM OF THE

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:42.228
STATE. AND WHEN THEY FAIL. STATE

02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:44.330
NEEDS TO STEP IN. USUALLY TO

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:47.166
BAIL THEM OUT WHY WOULD WE BE

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:48.100
TAKING THIS RISK. IN A WHOLE

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:50.336
AREA THAT IS. HAS DEMONSTRATED

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:52.138
SUCH SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY OVER

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:53.439
THE YEARS THERE ARE THE PEOPLE

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:55.007
WHO'VE HAD SOME INVESTMENTS IN

02:01:55.074 --> 02:01:57.977
IN CRYPTO MYSELF INCLUDED. AND

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:00.012
WATCHED IT AND I MADE THOSE

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:03.849
INVESTMENTS TO JUST TO SORT OF

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.651
SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS IT WENT

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:06.919
UP AND DOWN. I'M TALKING LESS

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:08.120
THAN A HUNDRED. THOUGH ALTAMENTE

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:09.722
BECAUSE IT WAS. TO SORT OF

02:02:09.789 --> 02:02:11.390
BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHAT WAS

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:12.458
HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS AND ALL

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.760
SO. WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A

02:02:14.827 --> 02:02:16.228
POSITION AS A LEGISLATURE OF

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:20.232
PREMATURELY CREATING. THIS

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:22.835
VENEER OF LEGITIMACY UNLESS AND

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.136
UNTIL WE REALLY HAVE THE RIGHT

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:25.871
FRAMEWORKS IN PLACE THAT'S WHAT

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:27.440
I'M HOPING WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:02:27.506 --> 02:02:29.842
WORKING ON AND GET. THEY THE

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:31.777
APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENTS TO PUT

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.112
TOGETHER THE RIGHT KIND OF

02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:35.147
FRAMEWORK AND EVEN DECIDE HE

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:36.582
GAVE ITS CURRENCY REGULATE AYE

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:38.651
CURRENCY IF IT'S A IF IT'S

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:39.118
INVESTMENT OR SECURITY

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:40.753
REGULATORS A SECURITY. BUT

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:41.754
NOBODY'S REALLY WILLING TO DO

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:43.355
THAT WITH THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:44.757
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO DO

02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:46.158
RATHER THAN JUST OPENING UP THE

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:48.360
DOORS AND SAYING SURE YOU CAN

02:02:48.427 --> 02:02:50.129
TRADE IN THE US. WHEN YEP THEY

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:50.930
PROBABLY COULD. I'MNOT SURE I

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:52.164
WOULD ENCOURAGE COUNTIES OR

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:53.499
CITIES OR SPECIAL THIS WEEK TO

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:55.301
DO THAT PRIVATE BUSINESSES

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.235
THAT'S THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:57.870
RISK ASSESSMENT BUT THERE'S LESS

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:59.638
AT STAKE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUBLIC

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.107
MONEY. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:02.875
PUBLIC MONEY I GET A LITTLE BIT

02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:05.678
MORE CONCERNED WITHOUT THE

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:07.546
REGULATORY BACKSTOP. THANK YOU

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:10.282
OF. MEMBER STONE DR CHOI WITH

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:14.320
YEAH- NOT OR SO- ECHO SOME OF

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:17.089
THE QUESTIONS- THE ASSEMBLYMAN

02:03:17.156 --> 02:03:20.192
STONE S. RAISED UP IN THE FIRST

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:21.594
OF ALL I THINK THAT THIS IS A

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:24.096
GOOD FORUM THANK TO SMM A

02:03:24.163 --> 02:03:27.066
CUNNINGHAM TO- BRING IT UP BUT-

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:29.268
AS A LACK OF PUBLIC HEARING

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.737
FORMAT. RATHER THAN ASKING US TO

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:34.707
VOTE ON IT THAT BECAUSE OF THIS

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:37.610
IS A VERY HUGE. ISSUE I KNOW-

02:03:37.676 --> 02:03:39.245
WAS- DEVELOPING AND OF WHAT'S

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:40.479
HAPPENING OUT THERE

02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:44.216
CRYPTOCURRENCY IS HERE TO STAY I

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:48.287
BELIEVE- HOWEVER. BY RECOGNIZING

02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:53.058
BY THE CALIFORNIA S- LEADER OF

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:56.328
THIS- MOVEMENT TO AMEND THAT

02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:58.297
DESIRE IS GOOD BUT I THINK WE

02:03:58.364 --> 02:04:01.734
NEED TO- TAKE A PRECAUTION

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:04.003
BECAUSE THIS OF RECOGNIZING

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:06.305
CRYPTOCURRENCY S. ON MACOS- A

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:10.142
SECONDARY- US DOLLARS. BECAUSE A

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.311
WE ARE AT THE GYM I SEE THAT THE

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:14.780
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND THAT SOME

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:17.183
COMPANIES- SUCH AS- TESTS A LOT

02:04:17.249 --> 02:04:22.087
I KNOWN THAT THE ONE TIME-

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.923
ELEVEN MUSCAT DECLARED THAT THEY

02:04:23.989 --> 02:04:25.958
WOULD TAKE CRYPTO CURRENCY TO

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:29.094
PURCHASE FOR THE- CONSUMERS TO

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:32.231
PURCHASE- THEY A TESLA VEHICLE

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:36.936
AND THEN HE- STOPPED IT. AND THE

02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:40.105
SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:42.808
IDEA. NEXT FORM I DON'T KNOW

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:44.376
THAT WOULD BE IS A SECOND

02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:50.850
HEARING TIME. TO HAVE- COMPANIES

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:53.786
LARGE COMPANIES SO WE HAVE DONE

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:56.722
A LOT OF RESEARCH ARE SUPPORTING

02:04:56.789 --> 02:05:00.159
THAT IDEA. THAT THAT YOU ARE

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:03.495
SUGGESTING AND HERE AND- SOME OF

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:06.765
THE OPPOSITION. GROUPS OR

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:09.735
EXPERIENCE- OR EVEN ELEVEN MUSKA

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:11.971
SAY WHY DID YOU STOP WE CAN ASK

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:14.940
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I THINK I

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:16.709
THOUGHT THOUGH CREDIBLE FORM

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:22.081
MORE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE- OUR

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:24.049
MEMBERS ARE ASKED TO VOTE

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:27.686
BECAUSE I ASSUME MOST OF US ARE

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:33.592
NOT EXPORTS. THE FUTURE. THE

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:37.463
IMPACT OF THIS A POLICY ONCE WE

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:41.166
MORANI IS SOUNDS GOOD AND- WE

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:43.535
BORDER ON IT UP BUT THERE MAY BE

02:05:43.602 --> 02:05:45.037
A VERY DEEP THE FINANCIAL

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:48.274
IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS SOME POINTS

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.875
WERE RAISED TO BUY AS THE

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:52.011
MINIMUM WAS A STORM SO I THINK

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:55.214
THAT THAT- IS OF SAMARIA- TO

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:57.883
SUGGEST THE FORTY FORTY TO

02:05:57.950 --> 02:06:00.085
PROVIDE ANOTHER FORM SO HEARING

02:06:00.152 --> 02:06:05.891
FORMAT TO EDUCATE US. THANK YOU

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:09.295
DR CHOI AND- MR GABRIEL ASSEMBLY

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.130
MEMBER YET THANK YOU MISTER

02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:14.166
CHAIR- AND- YOU WANT TO THANK

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:15.734
THE AUTHOR FOR STARTING THIS

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:17.903
CONVERSATION IT'S SUCH AN

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:18.570
IMPORTANT ONE- AND I WOULD JUST

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.773
ECHO THE RESPECT FOR YOU AND FOR

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.875
OUR- FROM A MAJORITY LEADER THAT

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.343
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE KAREN FROM

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.611
OTHERS HERE- AND I KNOW THAT

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.446
THIS IS SUCH AN AFFRONT

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:28.380
CONVERSATION AND I THINK THERE'S

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:29.915
THE CRYPTO PIECE OF THIS THERE'S

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:30.649
ALSO JUST THE LARGER

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:31.617
CONVERSATION ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN

02:06:31.684 --> 02:06:33.552
TECHNOLOGY WHICH I THINK IS A

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:34.486
REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND I KNOW

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:36.155
WE'RE GONNA HAVE. PART OF THAT

02:06:36.221 --> 02:06:36.689
CONVERSATION TOMORROW THE

02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:38.457
PRIVACY COMMITTEE- TO START TO

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.192
THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:41.493
POTENTIAL USES OF THAT

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.127
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY- AND I'LL

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.762
JUST REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT I

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:44.763
THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT ASSEMBLY

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:46.665
MEMBER STONE AND IS A MEMBER

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:47.666
CHOI ARE SAYING THE SAME THING

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.468
WHICH WHICH WE DON'T OFTEN MAYBE

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:51.203
ARE ALWAYS HERE AROUND HERE- AND

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.972
I SHARE. I THINK SOME OF THEIR

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:54.506
PERSPECTIVE HERE WHICH IS THAT

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:55.574
THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES

02:06:55.641 --> 02:06:56.909
HERE BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.677
AT AS A LEGISLATURE WITH

02:06:58.744 --> 02:06:59.411
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY- YOU KNOW

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:00.679
THIS IS CERTAINLY THE TECHNOLOGY

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.748
OF THE FUTURE AND I DON'T THINK

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:03.849
THAT THERE'S MUCH DOUBT ABOUT

02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:05.684
THAT- WITH A LOT OF- REALLY

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:06.618
POTENTIALLY EXCITING AND

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:08.420
INTERESTING USES AND I KNOW THAT

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:10.055
YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER ON THAT-

02:07:10.122 --> 02:07:11.824
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:12.491
START THIS CONVERSATION WHAT I

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:15.294
WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK WE

02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:16.195
NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.596
THE RIGHT WAY- THERE'S A-

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:18.497
SIMULTANEOUS CONVERSATION GOING

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:19.732
ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT.

02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:20.833
OUR COLLEAGUE MENTIONED- THAT I

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:22.601
THINK IS GOING TO HAVE SOME

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.802
REALLY POWERFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.971
CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR THE WAY THAT

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.106
WE- YOU KNOW REALLY START TO

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:27.973
THINK WHAT IS THE REGULATORY

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.509
ARCHITECTURE SO I JUST WANT TO

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:31.910
ECHO YOU KNOW SUPPORT FOR THE

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:33.846
FOR THE IDEA OF HAVING THESE

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:35.014
CONVERSATIONS- BUT ALSO DOING IT

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.415
IN THE RIGHT DELIBERATE THOROUGH

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.317
THOUGHTFUL WAY I THINK WE CAN

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.385
THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE WORK

02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:40.786
CALIFORNIA CAN BE. ON THE

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:42.721
CUTTING EDGE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:44.089

EVERYBODY I APPRECIATE IT THANK

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.889
YOU THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR- YOU'RE

02:08:16.955 --> 02:08:18.390
PUMPING THE BRAKES A LITTLE BIT

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:20.225
MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THIS AND

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:21.693
THOUGHTFUL WAY I GET THE NOTE OF

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.529
CAUTION AND I. TO ASSEMBLY

02:08:23.595 --> 02:08:24.730
MEMBER STONES POINT I GET THE

02:08:24.797 --> 02:08:26.098
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC MONEY

02:08:26.165 --> 02:08:27.833
AND PRIVATE MONEY AND THERE'S A

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.335
DISTRICT DIFFERENT RISK FACTOR

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:31.703
THERE AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.572
INTO ACCOUNT- THERE'S ALSO

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:35.441
REGULATORY RISK RIGHT SO THAT'S

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:38.110
THE QUESTION I THINK THIS

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:39.311
COMMITTEE. OVERTIMES GOING TO

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:40.379
HAVE TO. COME TO TERMS WITH

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:41.780
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT

02:08:41.847 --> 02:08:43.482
NOTHING SAYING YOU CAN OR CANNOT

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:45.884
DO THIS. EXCEPT SAY. BIG POINTY

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:47.953
IS ONE EXAMPLE FOR. LARGE

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.588
AMOUNTS OF COCA COLA OR WHATEVER

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:51.657
IT IS- AND SO BUSINESSES THAT

02:08:51.723 --> 02:08:53.592
ARE CHOOSING TO DO THAT ARE.

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:54.626
PLACED IN A POSITION OF

02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:56.462
UNCERTAINTY OR THEY DON'T KNOW

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:57.963
IF SOMETHING'S GONNA COME ALONG

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:59.998
LATER AND- PULL THE RUG OUT FROM

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.834
UNDER THEM. SO TO SPEAK- I DON'T

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.936
I DON'T HEAR THAT. FROM THIS

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:05.804
COMMITTEE IT DOESN'T SOUND SUPER

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.906
LIKELY BUT- CERTAINLY THAT SORT

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.708
OF AMBIGUOUS SITUATION THOSE

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:10.876
BUSINESSES ARE AND ARE SOMETHING

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:12.678
THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED. ON THE

02:09:12.744 --> 02:09:16.682
FEDERAL PIECE- YEAH THIS. THE I

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:17.816
DID DO SOME LEGAL RESEARCH THE

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:20.319
PREVAILING LEGAL OPINION IS

02:09:20.385 --> 02:09:22.788
THAT. CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOT

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:24.289
A SECURITY UNDER THE US

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:26.358
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT- THEY'RE

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:28.760
ALSO NOT A FIAT CURRENCY ISSUED

02:09:28.827 --> 02:09:29.728
BY A GOVERNMENT OR CENTRAL BANK

02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:32.164
SO. THERE THIS NEW DIFFERENT

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:33.966
THINGS. AND THEY HAVE AS

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:35.667
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE ALLUDED

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:38.036
TO. A DOCTOR CHOI- POTENTIAL TO

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:39.605
CUT OUT A LOT OF MIDDLE MEN AND

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.673
DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.575
DISRUPTIVE VERY PRO CONSUMER

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:45.544
POTENTIALLY AND- YEAH THERE'S SO

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:47.546
MANY LATENT BENEFITS TO. THE

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:49.648
SECURITY THE DECENTRALIZATION

02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:51.583
THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE

02:09:51.650 --> 02:09:52.584
EXCHANGED PEER TO PEER I MEAN

02:09:52.651 --> 02:09:54.453
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.654
ARE TREMENDOUSLY POTENTIALLY

02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:57.956
BENEFICIAL SO I'M I'M GLAD THAT

02:09:58.023 --> 02:09:59.525
YOU AFFORD ME THE TIME TO HAVE

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.560
THIS DISCUSSION. AND OBVIOUSLY

02:10:01.627 --> 02:10:03.462
WON'T BE ASKING FOR VOTE AS WE

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:06.498
DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I THINK

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:07.966
MAYBE ON THE PUBLIC IECE THE

02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:09.768
LAST THING I'LL SAY IS FOR

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:12.137
PUBLIC ENTITIES. IT MIGHT BE

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:13.639
SOMETHING WHERE IT MAKES SENSE

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:15.707
TO DO SOME SORT OF PILOT

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:19.344
PROGRAM. AT SOME CANNOT SENATORS

02:10:19.411 --> 02:10:21.146
. I MEAN. YOU KNOW SOMEONE

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.814
SOMEWHERE. WHERE THERE'S

02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:24.483
APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS IN A PLAN

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:26.818
IN PLACE IN CASE- THE VOLATILITY

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:28.887
GOES THE WRONG DIRECTION AND YOU

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.622
ARE OR MAYBE WITH A SMALL

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:32.724
SPECIAL SERVICES DISTRICT I'D I

02:10:32.791 --> 02:10:34.927
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:37.296
THERE- BUT I THINK- BLOCKCHAIN

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:39.598
WRIT LARGE AND CRYPTO AS PART OF

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:42.534
THE BLOCKCHAIN. IS IT IS GOING

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:44.236
TO BE INEVITABLE I THINK IT WILL

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:45.571
BE THE WAY A LOT OF OUR

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:47.206
TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE- YOU KNOW

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.907
WHETHER THE STATE NEWS OR NOT

02:10:48.974 --> 02:10:50.609
AND PROBABLY A DECADE PROBABLY

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:52.544
FASTER THAN. THAN WE THINK I

02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:54.746
THINK A LOT OF VITAL RECORDS

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:55.847
WILL BE THERE A LOT HEALTH

02:10:55.914 --> 02:10:57.749
RECORDS TO BE THAT EITHER- IF

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:58.250
THERE WERE. FOR EXAMPLE

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.885
