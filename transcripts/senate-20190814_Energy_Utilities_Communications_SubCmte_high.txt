WELCOME TO THE HEARING OF THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON GAS ELECTRIC AND TRANSPORTATION SAFETY UNDER THE ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SENATOR BEN HUESO. TODAY WE CONVENE TRIP TO DISCUSS THE PROACTIVE DE ENERGIES ATION OF POWER LINES OF PROCESS IS WE KNOW HAS BEEN CALLED THAT THE S. P. S. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. I RECOGNIZE THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES WITH P. S. P. S. IT'S A TOOL WITH CONSEQUENCES IF WE USE IT AND AS WE KNOW CONSEQUENCES IF WE DON'T. BUT IT IS A WILD FIRE MITIGATION TOOL THAT CAN BE UTILIZED IMMEDIATELY. WHILE OTHER MITIGATION MEASURES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. THIS THAT IS SO WHY I SUPPORTED P. GENIES DECISION LAST OCTOBER TO DE ENERGIZED PORTIONS OF THE NORTH BAY AND THIS YEAR IT'S- FOLLOWING THE EVENT P. JEANNIE DISCOVERED DOZENS OF INSTANCES OF WIND RELATED DAMAGE. TO THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE PRESUMABLY PREVENTING DOZENS OF WILDFIRES I KNOW SUCH A DECISION WAS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. CUSTOMERS LOST BUSINESS THOSE DEPENDENT ON ELECTRICITY FOR MEDICAL NEEDS FACED DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE STATE MUST MAXIMIZE PUBLIC SAFETY DURING SUCH EVENTS WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A P. S. P. S. REGENE. UTILITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW TO DE ENERGIZED. WE MUST ENSURE THEY DO SO WITH MANY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE AND TO DO SO EFFECTIVELY. WE'LL TAKE THE SUPPORT OF NOT ONLY THE UTILITIES AND STATE REGULATORS BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THAT WE ALL SERVE IN CALIFORNIA SELECT. TO WRITE MY COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WITH THIS AND ASK IF THEY HAVE SOME OPENING COMMENTS. SENATOR DOT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICES BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. SINCE AWHILE FIRES BROKE OUT NOW BUT SNOW BUT COUNTIES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE. SEVENTEEN AFTER THOSE FIRES WERE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL I WAS BESIEGED BY CONSTITUENT CHOIR HE'S ASKING WHETHER P. JEANNIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN DE ENERGIZING THEIR POWER LINES IN THE FACE OF FIERCE WIND EVENTS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE RECONVENE THE IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF SB NOT A ONE REQUIRE A UTILITIES TO IN. OUR MITIGATION PLANS PROTOCOLS DETAILING HOW THEY WOULD HANDLE THE ENERGIES ATION OF POWER LINES INTO THIS EBELING OF RE CLOSER. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF SB NINE A ONE WE PAID GREATER SCRUTINY TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE IN OF COME TO REALIZE IT DE ENERGIZED THE ENERGIES STATION CARRIES RISK OF ITS OWN WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED BY THE UTILITIES IN DEVELOPING THEIR DE ENERGIES ASIAN PROTOCOLS. ONE OF THOSE RESCUE SHUTTING OFF POWERS TO CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT THAT RUNS ON ELECTRICITY. THIS YEAR I'M OFFERING SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN DIRECTING THE UTILITIES TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR RISK IN THEIR MITIGATION PLANS THIS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS HE SAID SHOULD LEARN MORE FROM THE UTILITIES AND THE CPUC. HOW PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED AND MONITORED. I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN GAINING MORE UNDERSTANDING ON ADVANCE NOTICE HOW THAT ALL WORKS HOW SOON POWER CAN BE RESTORED AFTER PSP PSP'S. P. S. P. S. WHETHER UTILITIES OUT STAFFED UP TO EFFECTUATE RAPID RESTORATION HOW UTILITIES ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRST RESPONDERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OFFICIALS AND OTHERS TO DEVELOP MEANS TO MAINTAIN POWER TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ONCE AGAIN THE STREETS ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING. THANK YOU SENATOR THE SENATOR WINNER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S GOING TO. UP TO SIX. I HAVE TO SAY I AM. DEEPLY DEEPLY CONCERNED. WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW ALLOWING. PGA ANY ANOTHER UTILITIES TO ENGAGE IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS WITH NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OUR GUARD RAILS AND OVERSIGHT I IN PLACE. AND I THINK WE ARE CREATED A REGIMEWHERE THE UTILITIES HAVE EVERY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE AND- ARE ON THE SIDE OF SHUTTING DOWN POWER. TO DO TO ENGAGE IN TOO MANY POWER SHUT OFF ON THAT SIDE IN ORDER TO AVOID LIABILITY. AND TO MAKE THEM BROADER THAN DAY PERHAPS NEED TO BE. BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE UTILITIES IS TO AVOID LIABILITY. BUT THE COSTS OF THESE POWER SHUT OFFS ARE MASSIVE. WHETHER IT IS A SMALL CITY THAT HAS BEEN POWER DOWN OR WHETHER AS WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IT COULD BE THE ENTIRE CITY OF SAN JOSE OR SAN FRANCISCO GETTING POWER DOWN IF THAT'S WHAT HE'S YOU NEED BESIDES IS NECESSARY WHETHER IT'S FOR ITS PERCEPTION OF SAFETY. FOR ITS OWN. AVOIDANCE OF LIABILITY BECAUSE THE GRID IS IN SUCH POOR SHAPE BECAUSE IT HASN'T OF P. GINNY HAS NOT MAINTAINED THAT ARE PROPERLY. TO SCRIPT PROPERLY. IT'S WITH WIRES PROPERLY IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE PROPERLY NOW AND AS A RESULT A HUGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES COULD BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG I'M PAYING THE PRICE AND THE COSTS ARE REAL WHEN POWER IS SHUT OFF WE KNOW ABOUT HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES AND SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE. RESIDENTS ARE VULNERABLE INSTITUTIONS WE KNOW. WHAT THE MASSIVE PROBLEMS ARE THERE BUT IT GOES SO MUCH DEEPER I'VE BEEN NOT. I WAS JUST CONTACT THE LAST WEEK BY A BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT I WAS INFORMED BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY I THAT IF THEY EXPERIENCE A POWER SHUT OFF IN HUGE FINANCIAL LOSSES. THEIR INSURANCE WILL NOT COVER IT BECAUSE SINCE THEY GOT TWENTY FOUR MAYBE FORTY EIGHT HOURS NOTICE IT'S NOT A SIDE AND AN UNPREDICTABLE. EVENTS IT IS A PLAN SHUT DOWN AND SO THE DAY WILL SUSTAIN MASSIVE FINANCIAL LOSSES TENSELY PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEY WILL NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR IT I AND AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO RECOURSE AGAINST P. GINNY FOR DOING. AND I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. FOR P. GINNY IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE WE'RE GOING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF POWER SHUT OFFS. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO AVOID LIABILITY THERE HAS TO BE. A FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL IT IS NOT FAIR TO REPAIRS IT'S NOT FAIR TO BUSINESSES IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE LIVES. WILL BE DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED. BY POTENTIALLY VERY BROAD VERY DANGEROUS AND VERY SUSTAINED OUR POWER SHUTDOWNS. SO I'M JUST BEING VERY VERY BLUNT HERE. BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT WE SET UP I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE. WHO IS MAKING THESE DECISIONS I HELD UNILATERAL IS IT. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF P. GINNY CAN MAKE THAT DECISION DO A MASSIVE POWER SHUT OFF BUT THAT'S WRONG I WON HERE. HI HOW THAT'S WRONG I AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SHUTDOWNS AND HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A TRULY. BALANCED APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNERS SENATOR BRADFORD. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE HAVING THIS HEARING AND I'M NOT HERE TO BASH ANY PARTICULAR UTILITY BECAUSE- OUR SHOT SHOT OFF ARE NOTHING NEW I WORK FOR UTILITY COMPANY AND WE RETURN ROUTINELY HAD. OUR WHAT WE CALL A BLACKOUT FOR MISTER REASON TO EVEN DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS. IT WAS COORDINATED OUTAGES SO COORDINATED OUR AGES ARE NOTHING NEW AND I THINK MANY TIMES WE OVER REACT YES WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE A BREAST OF WITH A DOING WHAT WILDFIRES IN HOW DO WE MITIGATED IF IT'S CALLS BY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT- THE MERE FACT OF NEEDING TO SHUT OFF POWER. IS OF. GREAT CONCERN BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TO THE LEVEL THAT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING NEW I ARE YOU SEE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR DECADES. BASED ON WHATEVER THAT. YES EVEN TO IMPROVE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETIMES YOU YOU BRING DOWN AN ENTIRE GRITS NOW WHAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH AND WHICH EVER UTILITIES ALWAYS CONCERNED WITH IS YOUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SURE WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED BEFORE WE BRING THEIR POWER DOWN IN MEDICAL BASS LINE. IS ALWAYS A GREAT CRITERIA AND IN A UTILITIES LOOK AT THAT. BEFORE OFF. MANY POWER IS CUT OFF AND WERE HOSPITAL FACILITIES ARE AS WELL MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE. BACKUP GENERATION AS FAR EVEN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY SO. THOSE THINGS ARE CLEARLY COORDINATED IS NOT SOME RANDOM ACT JUST SHUTTING OFF POWER SO IT'S GREAT CONSIDERATION GONE. THAT GOES INTO THIS BUT I APPRECIATED HEARING BECAUSE IT'S A LOT WE CAN LEARN AND NOW. MANY WAYS WE CAN IMPROVE THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD TO. THE MORNING CENTERS KERN SURE. THANK YOU MISTER SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AND DIGGING DEEPER. YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT BURNT DOWN IN THE TWENTY SEVEN DISTRICTS. WITH WOLSEY AND- THE ENERGY IS ATION THERE'S IS STILL IN RETROSPECT DISCUSSIONS OF. WAS IT USED AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH WAS THERE TOO MUCH HESITATION. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY TENSIONS IN EVERY COMMUNITY AROUND. POWERING DOWN. AND THE BALANCE I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO STRIKE HERE IS HOW TO. GIVE UTILITIES THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY SAFE AND THAT WE DON'T SPARK FIRES DURING EXTREME INCIDENTS. BUT HAVE SOME KIND OF PLAN. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAFF REPORTS ANALYSIS AND I GOTTA TELL YA I'M I AM. NOT SATISFIED I DO NOT FIND IT TO BE WELL COORDINATED MITIGATION% STRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH P. S. P. S. IN THIS STATE. IT'S NOT UP TO SAY LIKE HAVE A GO BAG AND GOOD LUCK. OR GO FIND A COOLING CENTERS. IF YOU'RE A NURSING ASSISTANT FACILITY WHICH ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS DON'T HAVE OFSHE POD AND- BACKUP GENERATION REQUIREMENTS AND YOU. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYONE SIGNED UP TO AN OPT IN MEDICAL BASELINE. YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH A RESPIRATOR AND YOUR POWER GOES DOWN WHAT HAPPENED. EVERY WATER DISTRICT IN THE STATE I'VE NOT SEEN A RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK COME OUT TO BACK UP THEIR PUMPING STATIONS STOPLIGHTS CELL TOWERS THE TELECOM INDUSTRY ONLY RIGHT NOW I THINK HAS TO BACK UP FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS. THEN SHOW UP WITH COWS AND- OTHER CELL TOWERS ON WHEELS OR MOBILE GENERATION RESPONSE AFTERWARDS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR MUCH APPRECIATED FOR BACKUP POWER SYSTEMS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. NOT EVEN CLOSE THE DEMAND SOME OPEN HERE TODAY WE CAN SORT OF START TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND EIGHTY. WHAT IS A MAP OF VULNERABILITY REALLY LOOK LIKE. HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY ANALYZE WHAT THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE AND HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA NOT JUST AN I. O. U. TERRITORY. BUT IN. AND COUNTY IS AN INTEGRATED. SO THE CALLOW YES IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IF YOU SEE ANY I'LL USE THE PO USING THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT WE TRULY KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE. AND WHAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE GO DOWN. IT STARTS WITH THAT MAP AND THAT DATA SET AND SECOND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT AND WHAT ASSETS DO WE HAVE TO DEPLOY IN THOSE AREAS TO MANAGE THEM YES IT IS ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSERS IN GETTING YOUR GRID TIGHTER. AS A YOU CAN SORT OF RING FENCE YOUR YOUR POWER DOWNS BUT IT IS ALSO GONNA BE ABOUT DISTRIBUTED GENERATION IN THOSE AREAS. MICROGRAM IN SOME PLACES SOLAR STORAGE IN SOME PLACES FUEL CELLS AND OTHER PLACES BUT I DON'T THINK THROWING A BUNCH A DIESEL GENERATORS AROUND IS JUST GONNA SOLVE THIS I WAS RUNNING CONVOYS OF FUEL DOWN THE BLOCK PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. IN A YOU KNOW TRYING TO PUT A CARGO NET OVER A PICKUP TRUCK FULL OF LIGHT. YOU KNOW GETTING FUEL OUT OF SANTA MONICA BECAUSE IT WAS ALL SHUT DOWN AND NOW THAN TO PAYING I'D LIKE. JUST SO WE GET THE URGENT CARE CENTER BACK ONLINE BECAUSE MY FRIEND DID STEPPED ON A NAIL. I WAS TRYING TO GET A TECHNICIAN OUT AND SOME RELIEF LIKE THAT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IN A NEAR BY. SOME REALLY APPRECIATE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT YOU TOOK THIS ON TODAY I KNOW WE'VE GOT SEVERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION PENDING. FROM GOOD SENATOR DODD WORKING ON MEDICAL BASELINE SIDE ON THE D. OUR SIDE FROM SENATOR WIENER. I KNOW THERE'S OTHER VEHICLES IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT I TRULY THINK WE'VE GOT ACT. BEFORE THE END OF THIS SESSION ON THIS ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY TODAY SHED SOME LIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN I APPRECIATE THAT IT AND IT YOU CAN SEE THE PASSION IN FEEL IT IN THE ROOM. A REAL CONCERN AMONG US. ALL OF US HERE AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS BE DONE AND DONE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WILL BE EXAMINING. REALLY HOW TO BALANCE THOSE COMPETING FORCES WHEN SENATOR WIENER MENTIONED THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S THE UTILITIES ROLE TO REALLY YOU KNOW MINIMIZE THEIR LIABILITY AS BEST AS POSSIBLE BUT IT'S OURS IN THE C. P. UC'S ROLE. TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT'S THE GOAL HOW WE BALANCE THAT IT IS CRITICAL. AND HOW WE MINIMIZE WERE ESTABLISHED THE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO. ALLOW FOR OR THAT WOULD TRIGGER THAT. YES PS OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT THE STANDARDS WILL BE AND HOW THEY'LL BE DEVELOP THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE CAN DEVELOP AND GET THAT INFORMATION TODAY ANOTHER A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE OF OUR PANELISTS AND I KNOW THEY HAVE SOME GOOD VALUABLE COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE WILL BEGIN WITH THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE WITH OUR QUESTIONS AND I'LL TRY AND DO MY BEST WITH THAT AS WELL AND WITH OUR ANSWERS TO SO WE CAN GET AS MUCH INFORMATION IMPARTED TODAY AS POSSIBLE SO. WE DID INVITE THE C. P. U. C. O. YES AND CAL I SO TO DISCUSS THEIR WORK ENSURING PS PS EVENTS AND ALSO WE'VE AS P. JEANNIE THE UTILITY THIS NEWEST TO THIS P. S. PH. YES SPACE TO UPDATE. THIS UP. ON THEIR EFFORT TODAY SO WE WILL BEGIN AND- OF. SO IT WITH THE SIR TO THIS SERENA YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY INTHE TO ANSWERING IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STAKEHOLDER AFFAIRS FOR THE- CALIFORNIA. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR HELL. GOOD MORNING AND GOOD MORNING TO ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AS SENATOR HILL MENTIONED MY NAME IS JOANNE SERENA I AM AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU TODAY THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SET OF PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE EYES SO. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE CALIFORNIA I SO IS AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR IN A NON PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT COPPER CORPORATION. OUR PRIMARY MISSION IS TO ENSURE SAFE AND RELIABLE OPERATIONS OF THE FULL COLLECTOR SYSTEM 480% OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND A SMALL PART OF NEVADA'S GRID. WHEN I REFER TO THE BOOK ELECTRIC SYSTEM I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR TRANSMISSION LINE SYSTEM WHICH IS TRANSMISSION LINE LEVEL AND EQUIPMENT GREATER THAN A HUNDRED KILOVOLT VOLTAGE LEVELS. TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE OUR ROLE IN A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF EVENT. WHEN THE DECISION BY ONE OF THE UTILITIES TO DE ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL LINES IS MADE ESPECIALLY IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND TO REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK. AS THE GRID OPERATOR OF THE BILL COLLECTORS SYSTEM WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THE ENERGY FLOWING RELIABLY ACROSS THE GRID ULTIMATELY KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON IN THE POWER ON FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. TO THAT END WE ARE CONSTANTLY MONITORING THE OUR CONTROL CENTER TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN THE STATUS OF THE GRID AND ALWAYS PREPARING FOR THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF GENERATION OR TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS OUR NORMAL COURSE OF DAY TODAY'S DUTY. UNDER THE AYE ESOS TRANSMISSION CONTROL AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH EACH TRANSMISSION OWNER THE TRANSMISSION OWNER MAY TAKE FACILITIES OUT OF SERVICE WITHOUT THE EYES SAYS APPROVAL. FOR PERSONAL SAFETY OR IMMINENT POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO FACILITIES. ALSO AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR HILL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW UTILITIES HAVE GENERALIST ALREADY TO SHUT OFF ELECTRIC POWER PRIMARILY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THEREFORE IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND WILD FIRE MITIGATION UTILITIES MAY DECIDE TO PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZED BOTH AT THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL OR PERHAPS AT THE TRANSMISSION LINE LEVEL AS WELL. IN THE CASE OF A PROACTIVE DE ENERGY THE ENERGY STATION AT THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL THE UTILITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIRECT LOAD MANAGEMENT. IN THAT CASE THE I. SO WOULD SIMPLY MONITOR OVERALL CONDITIONS AND ENSURE CONTINUED RELIABILITY RELIABLE OPERATIONS OF THE GRID. WHEN THEY ARE ANTICIPATING DE ENERGY STATION AT THE TRANSMISSION LINE LEVEL I SO WOULD BE IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE UTILITY AND AS WITH ANY TRANSMISSION LINE OUTAGE WE WOULD EVALUATE ALL THE IMPACTS IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION WE WOULD DETERMINE MITIGATION MEASURES THAT MAY BE TAKEN AND WILL COORDINATE WITH THE UTILITY TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR DECISION TO DE ENERGIZED THE LINE. NOW IN TERMS OF NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A P. S. P. S. EVENT WE ANTICIPATE EARLY WARNING OF UP TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS THE IMPACTS. ONCE AN ASSESSMENT IS DONE WE WOULD COORDINATE WITH THE UTILITY AND IN SOME CASES THE PLAN MAY CHANGE BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THAT ASSESSMENT TO A BREAK BASED ON THAT. IMPACT OUR STUDY IMPACT. IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN THE EYES SO IT'S STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL THE UTILITIES WE LEVERAGE OUR CURRENT PROCEDURES TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC ABOUT TRANSMISSION EMERGENCIES. AND IF NECESSARY WE DO HAVE TOOLS SUCH AS FLEXO LURKS WHICH WE WOULD ISSUE TO CALL. FOR PUBLIC CONSERVATION TO HELP WITH LOAD MANAGEMENT IN POTENTIAL AFFECTED AREAS. AS WITH ALL TRANSMISSION RELATED EMERGENCIES THE EYES SO WILL COMMUNICATE WITH ALL ITS MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IT STAKEHOLDERS IF THERE ARE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS THAT ARE CAUSED. BY A P. S. P. S. TYPE OF AN EVENT. WE ALSO HAVE STANDARD COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS TO NOTIFY HELLO YES THE CPC OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT POINTS OF CONTACTS WHEN THE BRAT AN ESCALATION OF AN EVENT WARRANTS IT. IN SUMMARY THE ISO IS PREPARED TO SUPPORT UTILITIES PS PS PROGRAMS I WORKING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE UTILITIES AND ALL OF THE OTHER AGENCIES AND OUR CUSTOMERS. TAKE THE P. S. P. S. RELATED TRANSMISSION OUTAGES WHILE MAINTAINING RELIABILITY OF ELECTRIC SYSTEM. I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF THE DETAILS OF OUR ROLE AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A WAY WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THEM WITH THE AND WITH JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION WELL YOU. MENTIONED THE ABILITY THAT YOU HAVE. AND WHEN YOU SEE IT AT AM DISTRIBUTION YES P. S. THAT'S ONE THING BUT A TRANSMISSION CREECH CERTAINLY OTHER CHALLENGES IN EXPECTATIONS OF ON THE PART OF THE UTILITY AS WELL AS THE GREAT ITSELF. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE OUR AROUND TO CREATE CERTAIN REDUNDANCIES PERHAPS THE UTILITY DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO OR WOULD THEY HAVE THAT THAT OPTION TO DO WE WOULD WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE UTILITY TO MOVE THE POWER AROUND AND UTILIZE OTHER TRANSMISSION LINES WERE NECESSARY SO THAT WOULD ALL BE IN COORDINATION. WITH THE US AND UTILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS FOR THAT WILL FOLLOW. THAT NOW WE WIL MOVE ON TO ELIZAVETA NOW CHANCHAL DEPUTY EXECUTIVE. DIRECTOR OF SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING. I'M GOING TO START OFF BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE CPC'S ENGAGEMENTS IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THE S. P. S. OF PROGRAMS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAMS WAS IT WILL SEND YOU GAS AND ELECTRIC THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO THE PC. FOR APPROVAL OF THE YEAR IT'S UNIT IS THE XIN L. PROGRAM TO PREVENT WILDFIRES WHEN THE COMMISSION EXAMINED THAT APPLICATION TO DETERMINE THE. UNDER THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE ALREADY HAD. THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT OFF POWER TO THEIR LINES IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE COULD NOT OPERATE THEM SEE PHILLY IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE UTILITIES OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THAT THEY RUN THEIR SYSTEMS SAFELY AND S. AS AN OPERATOR THEY CAN ALL DO SO FOR ANY REASON. THERE ARE ALLOWED TO SHUT THE POWER OFF. HOME SO THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THE WHICH WE OPERATE IS THAT IT IS THE UTILITIES. RESPONSIBILITY TO RUN THE SYSTEM SAFELY AND AS AN OPERATOR THE HOW OF THE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE IN THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEREFORE ALL. THE IN CITY THAT MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THEIR FACILITIES FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON TO SHUT THEM OFF. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS SHUTTING OFF POWER FOR RECEIVE TO REASON IS REALLY NOT THE EXCLUSIVE TO WILDFIRE THREATS. OF THE CLOSEST OF THE PAYROLL ALL AND DRAW ON IT IS A UTILITIES YOU ENERGIZING UNDERGROUND FACILITIES WHEN THERE'S A THREAT OF FLOODING. AND MOST NOTABLY CON EDISON DE ENERGIZING THE LINES HE HAD ALL OF SANDEEP. HOME TO PROTECT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN MANHATTAN ALL WHICH ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE HERE CITY WIDE OUTAGE I BELIEVE AT THAT TIME. BEFORE THE STORM ACTUALLY HIT THEM THIS EDITED FOR. ECEIVING THE ELECTRIC GRID THERE SO IT DOES HELP IN ANOTHER CONTEXT OF WHERE IT IS THE DIFFERENT WHAT'S REALLY BECOME DIFFERENT THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. IS THE EXTENDS ALL THREATS OF THAT WE'RE FACING WILL OF THE WILD FIRE OUT CONDITIONS AND HOW THE UTILITIES HELP RIO VALLEY WAITED THEIR OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THAT SNEAKING THE P. S. P. S. PROGRAMS LARGER PARTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AFTER THE- THE- PRIOR TO TWENTY. SEVENTEEN LOOK FOR YOUR SEASON ONLY IS JEANNIE HOW ODD L. A. B. AN OPERATIONAL PROGRAM FOR PROACTIVELY SHUTTING OFF THEIR LINES. EVEN AT THAT POINT THE WEREN'T ACTUALLY ACTIVELY USING AT THE THAT A LOT OF WORK TO SET IT UP BUT THE ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF EVENTS IN THE WERE RELATIVELY MINOR. ALL P. JEANNIE DID NOT HELP SUCH PROGRAM AND SO IN CALIFORNIA EDISON ON THE KEYS AND DID YOU ENERGIZE THEIR LINES. BUT IT WASN'T REALLY POOR IT'S OVER THE SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM WAS OPERATIONAL. DECISION THAT THEY MADE US. REALLY A COUPLE OF TIMES HELP PRIOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN GOT THE SOME CALIFORNIA DISCIPLINE P. G. NEED TO RE EVALUATE THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE NEW TO FIGHT AIDS THE COMMISSION THEN THE PUBLIC THAT THEY WERE IN SENDING TO MAKE PROACTIVE OUR SHUTTLE FOR BIG PARTS OF THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN RESPONSE THE COMMISSION ISSUED A RESOLUTION DIRECTING OF HE JEANNIE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO FOLLOW. THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE PUT ON AS THE G. NEED FOR THAT PROGRAM NOTABLY FOCUSING ON COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES THAT RESOLUTION DIRECTED UTILITIES TO MEET WITH OF COMMUNITIES THERE ARE IMPACT AND THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY THEIR DO YOU NEW JERSEY SOME PROGRAMS AND WORK WELL WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FIRST RESPONDERS TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES. THAT ROAMS ALL OF. MEETING WITH THAT THE AND NOTICES THAT THE UTILITY STARTED HAVING REALLY ELEVATED ELM THE THESE PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN FOR A LOT OF MORE ATTENTION TO THEM THAT L. A. THINK WAS PREVIOUSLY HAD UNLESS ISRAEL. AND THE WILL TO THIS THING I WOULD SAY CATEGORIES OF PROBLEMS THAT BECAME PARENTS ABOUT SLIME ONE WAS THE IMPACT ON OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THOSE SCHOOL OR- YELP MEDICALLY DEPENDENCE ON. ELECTRICITY AND TO THE IMPACT OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS. ALL ME AND ILL. THE ONE FROM FROM SHOT OFF AND IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMISSION CONVENE SEVERAL WORKSHOPS TO EXAMINE THESE ISSUES FURTHER AN OPEN RULE MAKING L. TOOL CONTINUE EXAMINING OUT THESE PROGRAMS AND FINDING WAYS TO MAKE THE WORK BETTER WE ALSO ALL PARTNERED WITH CAL WE US TO THE OPERATIONALIZE OF PROCESS SEES SLOW FOR PS PS PROGRAMS HOME AND CONTINUED TO WORK WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW. EL TO MAKE ELM. THE RUN BETTER I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS ALL OF. LESSONS LEARNED IS I THINK WE'RE ALL COLLECTIVELY REALIZING JUST HOW COMPLEX THIS ISSUE IS AND HOW IMPORTANCE ELM. WE THIS YEAR. THERE ARE HOUSES ACTUALLY WE IN MANY SHUTTLE FROM FENCE YET THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD WAS IN THE EARLIER THIS SUMMER WITH P. JEANNIE BUT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF NOTICES OF FROM UTILITIES ACTIVATING SPECTRALLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON OF THE AS THEY'RE STANDING UP THEIR PROGRAM AND ONE THING THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THAT IS THAT SHORT OF AN ACTUAL UNIT JERSEY XIN OF AND JUST LOSE NOTICES IN ACTIVISION'S HOW OF ALL THE MAJOR IMPACT BOOTH ON CITIZENS WHO ARE GETTING THESE NOTICES AND MEETING TO MAKE DECISIONS AS TO HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE HOME BUT ALSO AND THE FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY AND. ON POLICE TO THE SUCH. AS. HELLO THE TRY TO BE PREPARED FOR AN EVENT THAT MAY BE COMING AND THEN WHEN THE NOTHING HEALTH IS THAT IN THAT SOLVE HOUSE A PRETTY MAJOR. IMPACT THE VERY REAL COSTS. ELAM WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK VERY CLOSELY ON THESE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP AND LEARN FROM WHAT'S CURRENTLY NOT WORKING IN THESE PROPHECIES TO MAKE THEM WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. HOME I WILL. AND WAY TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT I HOPE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE AND ONE IS THAT IT'S A YOU THINK THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF ACCEPTABLE IN LOTS OF THE NOBLE. OF THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY OF DEALING WITH WILD FIRE THREATS AND- L. INCLUDING THE ROLE THAT THE LOVE PS PS PROGRAMS PLAY. L. OVER LONG TERM THE UTILITIES SUBMITTED THAT THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE IT OUT TO THE COMMISSION. THAT HALL OF VARIOUS EFFORTS AND HE TOLD AND ALMOST HOW UTILITIES OR ARE PLANNING TO SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCE OF WELL AT THE RISK OF WILDFIRE THREAT FROM THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND BUILD INCREASING INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE OF THE TWO WEEKS TO GO THERE AND ILL REDUCING HE CHANCE OF IGNITION IS A GOOD PORTION OF THAT SO WHETHER IT IS CORRECTING. HELP MAINTENANCE DEFICIENCIES. HISTORICALLY OR USING COATED IN SO CONDUCTORS IN HI FI A THREAT ZONES OR EVEN ON THE GROUNDING PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEM THERE ARE LONG TERM PRESS UP PLANS OF HOW TO MAKE. THE SYSTEM ITSELF WHAT THE LESS LIKELY TO FORK OUT WHILE OUT FIRES AND THAT THOSE EFFORTS OVER TIME SHOULD REDUCE. THE NEED TO FOR THE UTILITIES TO SHUT OFF POWER. THE SECOND AREA IS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF MY ALL SHUTTING OFF A PARTICULAR LINE. CURRENTLY LEADS RELEASE OF THE FOR THE SYSTEM DESIGNS THE SAN DIEGO SYSTEMS A LOT MORE NETWORK THEM WHAT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO IS TO BE QUITE SURGICAL WHEN THERE'S READING OFF A SPECIFIC LINE IN MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF THE CUSTOMERS LOSS OF LOAD THAT THAT ACTUALLY HOUSE. SO SOMEONE MMHM SOME OF THE. THE IS SHUT OFF ADVANCEMENT SING DIEGO. THE LARGELY REASON FOR THAT IS THE ACTUAL SYSTEM DESIGN WHERE THE THIS THE P. GENIES SAID THE SYSTEM IS RADIO VERSUS NETWORK LIKE WE HAVE IN THIS D. G. NEED TERRITORY. IT'S ELEMENT SINCE IT DID SIX VERY LONG TIME A LOT OF INVESTMENTS TO REDESIGN THE GRANTED BUT IT'S WELCOME THE GENIE IS SO AND OTHER UTILITIES ARE ALSO MAKING INVESTMENTS. IN THAT AREA SO THAT WOULD. OVER TIME REDUCE THE IMPACT OF SHUTTING OFF SPECIFIC LINES THAT MIGHT BE RISKY. ELEMENT AND THEN L. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO OVERTIME GET BETTER IN TERMS OF I'LL RISK ASSESSMENT AND ABILITY TO PREDICT OF THE RISK OF WILDFIRES IN THE VERY SPECIFIC ELM. AND IT'S A VERY DEEP THE LEVEL OF GRANULARITY AND NOT AS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE RED FLAG WARNING SYSTEM IS IT TOO HIGH A LEVEL FOR UTILITIES TO OPERATIONALIZE. THE V. IN THAT THOUGH SOLVING THIS ISSUE BY DEPLOYING WEATHER STATIONS ON THEIR CIRCUITS ELM AND GETTING MUCH MORE PRECISE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO WHERE THE FACILITIES ARE THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE'S NO SINGLE THREATS IN BACKS THAT UNITES. EVERYBODY WHO RESPONDS TO WILDFIRE. KING ABOUT IT WELL THAT SHOULD EASE SOME OF THE CONFUSION THAT RIGHT NOW TAKES PLACE WHEN THE UTILITIES COMMUNICATING ABOUT A POTENTIAL ALL SHOT OFF AND THE WILDFIRE THROUGHOUT THE THERE YOU ARE HOME. ASSESSING AND THEN LASTLY WITH COMMENTS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP AROUND OTH THE IMPACT OF LOSS OF POWER IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ON THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AND THE TO PAYING TO CANYON IS THE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OVAT WHERE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY LOSE POWER. ELEMENT THE REALLY LOOSE GOOD OLD THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES SO IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY IT JUST ABILITY TO TELL PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND COMMUNICATE IN THAT AREA BECOMES VERY VERY LIMITED. BUT THE POWERS OF THE PS FEELS PROGRAMS ARE EXPOSING IS THOSE CHALLENGES BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY A LOSS OF POWER COULD TAKE PLACE AND COMMUNITY SO I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO THE FACT THAT THE PS PS PROGRAMS ARE EXPOSING THIS VULNERABILITY. THAT WE HEALTH BECAUSE WE IT INCREASINGLY OR ROLE OF RELYING MORE AND MORE ON IN HOME A LIKE ONE ELECTRICITY ELECTRIC SUPPLY. OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM IS RELIANCE ON THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY AND NOW WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE CARBONIZED IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN MAKING NOT RELIABLE NO ELECTRIC SUPPLY AS WELL AND HELP WITH THAT CALMS. THE RISK THAT IT POSES TO PUBLIC SAFETY IF WE LOSE ELECTRIC POWER SO I THINK EL TALKING ABOUT HOW TO REGARD COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE TO LOSS OF POWER IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT THEY THINK IT'S BENEFICIAL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT TO THE TO. KEEP IN MIND THAT PSP ELSE IS NOT THE ONLY REASON AND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE EVEN IF P. S. P. S. ALL PROGRAMS WERE TO SOMEHOW WILL COME WHEN NECESSARY AND GO AWAY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOLD THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. ELEMENT IN THAT AS WITH DESIGN SOLUTIONS L. AS TO THAT ISSUE A THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT IT MORE BROADLY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. HOLDING IT FOR THE ROOT PROBLEM OF RESILIENCE OF OUR COMMUNITY IS ALL. AND NOT JUST MAKING P. S. P. S. ALL. TRANSMISSION IS LEFT TO THE UTILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE EXCELLENT EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND STAFF REPORT THAT WAS DONE FOR THIS COMMITTEE HERE AND REALLY GOES INTO THE DETAILS OF THE DISCRETION REALLY AND THE DIFFERENT CRITERIA UTILIZED BY EACH UTILITY IN MAKING THAT DECISION. AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT OR QUESTIONS LATER BUT- ARE YOU LOOKING AT STANDARDIZING THAT IN SOME FORM IF YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PS PS PROTOCOLS SO THAT. THERE IS LESS DISCRETION PERHAPS AND MORE DETERMINED PERHAPS USING MACHINE LEARNING TO DETERMINE. OR ESTABLISH THOSE CRITERIA THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN THEN IT'S A LITTLE MORE RELIABLE LESS IN THE HANDS OF THE UTILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. BUT MORE IN THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THAT RATHER THAN. AND I THINK IT IS MORE OF A SCIENTIFIC. DECISION. L. IT AT THIS POINT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE REMAINS OF THOSE THE OPERATOR AT THE UTILITIES GET TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO KEEP THEIR FACILITIES ENERGIZED OR NOT AND IT'S A. B. L. QUITE SIGNIFICANT LINE TO CROSS I MEAN THERE IS NO CURRENTLY. I WOULD SAY WE GENERALLY JUST DON'T KNOW. ONE WE JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR ALL OF WILDFIRES IN THE COULD CONDITIONS THAT. RESULTS IN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES REMOTE ELECTRIC LINES THERE'S SOME HIGH LEVEL THEORIES AROUND ITS- BLADES OF THERE IS. EITHER LOW SPECIFIC SET OF CONDITIONS THAT THE TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND VETTED THROUGH SOME KIND OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS THAT CAN SAY THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IF YOU DO IT YOU KNOW ALL WARRANTED TO ENERGIZE THE LINES IN REALITY IT BECOMES. ALL A QUESTION OF ALL OF ALL THE LEVELS OF RISK AND WHAT KIND OF FIRES OR WE TOLD HIM. YOU KNOW OR DO WE REALLY WANT TO PREVENTS ELM AND UP I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THIS POINTS SO WE HOW OF EITHER ENOUGH DATA OR KNOWLEDGE. IT TO BE ABLE TO DRAW THAT LINE ACCURATELY SO ELEMENT THEY THINK WHERE WE ARE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT AND CLAIM IS CONTINUING TO LEARN ALL FOR ALL MY- WEIGHT KIND OF CONDITIONS SO. THE UTILITIES DEEM TO BE RISKY HOME AND THEN HALL OF DISCUSSIONS OF THEM AFTER THE FACT OLD. GREEN COLLECTIVELY OVER THE ASSESSMENTS ALL THE EXPERTS WORKING IN THIS FIELD OF WITH THE WERE INDEED L. POSED A HIGH RISK OF HAVING A FEEDBACK MAC MECHANISM AND CONTINUING TO COLLECT. MORE AND MORE DATA AND GETTING MORE ADVANCED IN TERMS OF HOW WE ASSESS RISKS SO WHILE IT MAY BE. IF THEY'RE RADICALLY POSSIBLE TO HALL OF MORE STRICT. GUIDELINES WERE EVEN RULES AROUND IT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE QUITE THERE YET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBSON CHIEF OF HEAD QUARTERS I'M SORRY YES OF COURSE THANK YOU HI I THANK YOU FOR THAT JUST TWO TWO QUESTIONS. ARE THE FIRST SAYS AND THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT SDG IN THE WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE IS A SMALLER UTILITY AND SO IT'S LESS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABLE TO DO MORE SURGICAL. OUR POWER SHUT DOWNS AND AGAIN I KNOW P. GINNY I MESSAGES DIFFERENT TOADIES DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS. I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW IDENTICAL THEY'RE NOT. THIS TERRITORY WE'RE GOING TO SEE OF VERY OVERBROAD OF POWER SHUT OFF THAT ARE GOING TO AFFECT A HUGE SWATH OF OUR REGION. EVEN THOUGH IT'S A VERY LOCALIZED VIRUS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHY IS IT. THAT P. GINNY IS NOT ABLE TO DO THESE MORE SURGICAL SHUT OFF AND WHAT IS THE CPUC DOING TO ENSURE THAT. HE JENNY MOVES TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE IT CAN DO THE SURGICAL SHOT OFFICE. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE THE GENIE AND THE P. JEANNIE OF THIS VERY AS REASONS FOR THE HOME AND SOME OF THEM ARE THE TO DO WITH JUST THE HISTORY OF THE SYSTEMS THE P. JEANNIE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WAS ONE LARGE LARGER BUT ALSO MUCH OLDER SO THOUGH IS THE GENIE TERRITORIAL SMALLER IT'S NEWER OF WHEN THE WE'RE DOING THE CONSTRUCTION OF WITH A LOT OF THOSE ON THE GROND HOME SO THEY WERE ALREADY DEALING WITH MUCH SMALLER FOOTPRINTS AND BECAUSE THE AS THE SYSTEM WAS BEING PUT INTO PLACE THEY WERE ABLE TO. DESIGN ADS WITH MORE ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE WORKERS P. JEANNIE ELM IS IT THE VAULT DIFFERENTLY OVER TIME SO SOME OF IT ISN'T NECESSARILY THAT IS D. GENIE IS NOT MUCH BETTER WELL THE P. JEANNIE BECAUSE OF ADVANCE PLANNING AND SOME OF IT YOU KNOW THE THEY DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO START ALL LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT MINIMIZING IMPACTS OF THEIR BUT OF LINES OF THE COULD POTENTIALLY DE ENERGIZED WITH A LOT OF IT DOES ALSO ALL THEIR BENEFITING FROM THE SYSTEM DESIGN. THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WHAT WELL FIRE PREVENTION ELM. IN THE FIRST PLACE IN TERMS OF WEIGHT YOU KNOW. CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HOW OFF. OF ME AND- THE PART OF P. GENIES WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN IN THIS THIS THING CAN TALK MORE TO IT DOES INCLUDE ADDING MORE SECTIONAL LASERS AND OTHERWISE RECONFIGURING THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN GET ELM. A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT MINIMIZING THE IMPACT WHEN THEY DE ENERGIZED ELM LINES THAT ARE IN THE HIGH FILE THREAT ZONES. AND THEN. AND I'M SUREYOU DIDN'T MISS A SINGLE ADDRESS DIED IN THE TIMING ON THAT BUT IN THE OTHER QUESTION IS TO JUST TO BE CLEAR. SO WHEN I WHEN I ELECTRIC UTILITY DECIDES TO POWER DOWN. ON THAT CAN AVOID LIABILITY FOR THE UTILITY WHAT ARE THE FINANCIAL. CONSEQUENCES FOR UTILITY FOR ENGAGING IN A SHUT DOWN AND ARE THERE ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES NOT. TO GO NOT TO ARE ON THE SIDE OF BEING. BROAD. WHAT ARE THERE ARE I MEAN OF COURSE YOU'RE I MEAN PEOPLE ARE NOT PURCHASING ELECTRICITY TO RATE THEIR LOSING THAT REPAIR MONEY BUT THAT'S SMALL IN THE IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS ARE THEIR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR THEM NOT TO ENGAGE IN AN OVERLY BROAD. SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A ONE SIDED INCENTIVE FINANCIALLY. OF YEAH A THING PROBABLY MISS THE SINGLES BUT IT THE POSITION TO TALK ABOUT THE HOW UTILITIES VIEW IT BUT AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF THERE ARE NO RULES SPECIFIC MAKE IT WOULD COST MECHANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO DATE WHO THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO P. S. P. S. ALL PROGRAMS. ALSO THERE IS NO WAY TO TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE THE COST IS BEING I'M COVERED BY A LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALL OVER TO THE UTILITY OF A BUSINESS IS PUSHED. OUT OF BUSINESS THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE. I MEAN NOT THROUGH THE PC REGULATORY PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT WILL MOVE TO CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS CHIEF OF HEADQUARTERS OPERATION FOR RESPONSE SECTION OF THE RESPONSE SECTION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WELCOME AND THANK YOU THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SENATORS SO AS I MENTIONED I'M THE CHIEF OF RESPONSE HEADQUARTERS OPERATIONS THAT CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF MARIE SERVICES CALLOW YES. IN THAT ROLE I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER DURING ACTIVATIONS AND ARE CALIFORNIA STATE WARNING CENTER WHICH OPERATES A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MONITORING ASSESSING NOTIFYING STATE RESPONDER IS OF EMERGING INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. IN THAT ROLE I PLAYED THE OPERATIONAL LEAD AS WITH OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE I. O. U.'S I'M ON THE ELEMENT OF THE PS PS PROGRAM SO CAROL YES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND CAL FIRE HAS BEEN LEADING COORDINATION WITH THE I. O. USE P. JEANNIE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SDG ANY IN RESPONSE TO THE I USED ELEMENT OF THE P. S. P. S. UP PROGRAMS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THEY ARE USE OF DEVELOP THAT THE PS PS PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE THEIR RISK OF FIRES A UNITED BY THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE SO TURNING OFF THE POWER IN OUR MODERN POWER DEPENDENT SOCIETY OF COURSE HAS CASCADING CONSEQUENCES AND THAT'S KIND OF THE ROLE THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED IN ON ESPECIALLY WHEN THE POWER OUTAGES CAM LAST DAYS. SO MR US SAYING MAY GET INTO A GREATER DETAIL ON THIS BUT THE OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS OF A P. S. P. S. EVENT IN MANY CASES CAN LEAD TO TWELVE PLUS POWER OUR OUR OUR POWER OUTAGES AFTER THE POWER IS TURNED OFF THE I. YOU YOU MUST WAIT FOR THE WEATHER EVENT TO SUBSIDE. COMPLETE A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS IMPACTED BY THAT WEATHER EVENT DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS AND THEN RE ENERGIZE THE LINE SO THIS CAN LEAD TO A MULTI OUR. OUTAGES AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY MULTI DAY OUTAGES. SO CARILLO YES ALONG WITH CEBU SEEING CAL FIRE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. OF THESE LONGER THAN NORMAL POWER OUTAGES AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE AND THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE LONG COMMUNITIES. SO AS HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED JUST A FEW OF THEM THE PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS ON OUR PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER IS AND THEY'RE REDUCED. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TO RESPOND IF THEY'RE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE POWER OUTAGE. ON TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE POWER DOWN AND DURING OVERNIGHT HOURS WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS ARE OFF LINE. COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WOULD BE OFF LINE AND CERTAINLY THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH LIFE SUPPORTING MEDICAL DEPENDENT. APPOINTMENTS THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BECOME VULNERABLE TO THIS AS WELL. TO ALL OF THESE IMPACTS HAVE LED TO A POTENTIALLY CAT COULD COULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY CASCADING EMERGENCIES THE DEVELOP OUT OF THE DECISION TO POWER DOWN. SO HELLO YES AS THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING EMERGENCY SERVICES AT THE STATE LEVEL IN SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE I'LL USE FOR OVER A YEAR TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO THESE EVENTUAL. IMPACTS OF PS PS EVENTS WE'VE LET EXECUTIVE AN OPERATIONAL COORDINATION THROUGH WEEKLY MEETINGS I'M ACT HELLO YES AT THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP LEVEL UP WITH PARTICIPATION FROM HELLO YES SI PC. CAL FIRE IN THE AISLE USED TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AND DRIVE ACTIONS AND KEY LINES OF EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE AREAS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON IS LEADING COORDINATION WITH THE I USED TO DEVELOP THE STATEWIDE PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM I'M AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. PREPARE FOR POWER DOWN. ON WHICH INCLUDED RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA OUTREACH EXPLAINING THE PS PS PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN BUILD AWARENESS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AND IT AND THAT INCLUDES A WEBSITE THAT YOU MAY BE AWARE OF PREPARE FOR POWER DOWN .COM. WE'VE HELD NUMEROUS REGIONAL LISTENING SESSIONS AND COORDINATION CALLS WITH OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY KEY AREAS OF CONCERN. IN COORDINATED TO DRIVE I OWE YOU ENGAGEMENT ON THOSE AREAS OF CONCERNS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE HAVE HELD SEVERAL PS PS ORIENTATION WORKSHOPS TO EDUCATE OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS ON AS WELL AS THE CALLOW YES WORK FORCE SPECIFICALLY ARE INCIDENTS SUPPORT TEAMS WHICH SUPPORT OUR STATE OPERATIONS CENTER ON THE PS PS PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THAT THE OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR STATE IS THE PARTNERS ARE AWARE OF WHAT PS PS IS OUR WHEN THEY COULD HAPPEN AND START ANALYZING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR STATE FAMILIES INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES. AND CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THESE P. FPS ORIENTATIONS HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STAGE THE PARTNERS TO LEARN ABOUT PS PS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE HOW SUCH EVENTS COULD IMPACT. THEIR DIRECT AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS. SUCH AS ON OUR FIRE SERVICES AND OUR PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES AS WELL AS OUR MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO INCORPORATING PS PS EVENTS AND THE POTENTIAL POWER OUTAGE IMPACTS INTO OUR REGULAR EXERCISE PROGRAM TO BUILD OUR WORK FORCES AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE BASE. FOR THESE TYPES OF ISSUES AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WE MAY FACE DURING A LARGE SCALE OR HIGH IMPACT PS PS EVENT. TO ENSURE OUR READINESS AT THE STATE OPERATIONS LEVEL THE OPERATIONS CENTER LEVEL TO RESPOND TO AN EVENT. MOST IMPORTANTLY HOWEVER CAL YES CONSIDER THIS CALIFORNIA STATE WARNING CENTER AXES THE STATE THE STATE'S NOTIFICATION POINT. FOR PS PS EVENTS FROM THE I. O. U.'S. SO IN THAT SENSE WE HAVE DEVELOPED ON A CLEAR NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL WITH THE I. O. U.'S TO INFORM THE STATE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS. SO PER THE CPU SEES DECISION THE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY US THE CALIFORNIA STATE WARNING CENTER WHEN THEY ACTIVATE THEIR PS PS PROTOCOLS. AND MAY DECIDE TO DE ENERGIZED LINES DUE TO A PS PS OF AN. THE D. I. O. U.'S ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE WARNING CENTER UPON FIVE TRIGGER POINTS IN A P. S. P. S. EVENT. THE FIRST IS WHEN THE ACTIVATE THEIR PS PS PROTOCOLS THAT'S BEAT UP ONES THAT THAT'S WHEN THEY DECIDED THEIR MOST MIGHT DECIDE TO TURN OFF THE POWER. THEY THEN ALSO NEEDED LET US KNOW WHEN THEY'VE ACTUALLY MADE THE DECISION TO DE ENERGIZED. AS WELL AS WHEN THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DO DE ENERGIZED I CALL THAT DIFFERENTIAL OUT BECAUSE DEPENDING ON THE I OWE YOU THERE CAN BE A TIME DELAY BETWEEN WHEN THEY DECIDED THE ENERGIZED. WHEN THE ACTUAL DINNER DECISION HAPPENS. THEY ALSO NEED TO NOTIFY US ONCE THEY- THE WEATHER EVENT HAS SUBSIDED. AND THEY HAVE BEGUN THE REASSESSMENT PATROLS TO BE ABLE TO RE ENERGIZE. AND THEN THE FINAL NOTIFICATION POINT. IS WHEN THEY'VE ACTUALLY REENERGIZED ALL OF THE LINES. SO WHEN THEY NOTIFY US ON EACH OF THESE FIVE TRIGGER POINTS TO THEIR REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN INFORMATION PER THE CPC DECISION. THE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THEY IN A SUMMIT OF THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROVIDE US. ARE THE SPECIFIC AREAS OF POTENTIAL PSP PS OUTAGE SO THE POLYGONS OF THE CIRCLES THE AREAS OF THEIR CONSIDERING TO. TURN OFF. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IN THOSE AREAS. THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL BASS LINE IN OR CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IN THAT THOSE POTENTIAL AREAS. IN THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT THEY HAVE DEFINED THAT ARE IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE WEATHER EVENT. BECAUSE THAT GIVES US SOME GUIDANCE ON THE POTENTIAL TIMING. OF THE EVENT. AND LASTLY ONE OF TE IMPORTANT AREAS THAT THEY COMMUNICATE WITH US ON IS CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS. AND THE STATUS OF THE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF NOTIFICATION. TO THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE OR CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS DEPENDING ON HOW THEY DEFINE IT. UPON RECEIPT OF EACH OF THESE NOTIFICATION FROM THE UTILITY. THE WARNING CENTER DISTRIBUTES THIS NOTIFICATION DIRECTLY TO OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THROUGH OUR DUTY OFFICER PROGRAM SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. DUTY OFFICERS AND FIRE LAW AND ARE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES AND MAY PASSED THAT NOTIFICATION ON TO THEIR LOCAL PARTNERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED OR ARE ADJACENT TO THE POTENTIAL IMPACT AREA. OF THE PS PS EVENT SO THAT THE BROAD PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER COMMUNITY IS AWARE OF THE PUT POTENTIAL PS PS OF AND- WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE THIS NOTIFICATION. FOR TO DOWN TO A PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH CENTERS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM KNOWN AS CLASS AS WELL SO THERE'S ALSO A DIRECT NOTIFICATION TO OUR DISPATCH CENTERS THAT ARE UP ON CLASS. DURING ACTIVE PS PS EVENTS HELLO YES STAYS IN DAILY CONTACT WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THAT IS EXECUTING THIS PAST PS OF AND THROUGH DAILY BRIEFINGS. AND FOR LARGER EVENTS WE MAY HOLD A STATE AGENCY COORDINATION CALLS TO ENSURE THAT THE ENTIRE STATE FAMILIES AWARE AND ENGAGED ON THE A AND READY TO RESPOND TO THE POTENTIAL CASCADING IMPACTS. OF A LONGER TERM DE ENERGIES ATION AND POWER OUTAGE. AS OF TODAY P. JEANNIE AN S. C. E. HAVE ACTIVATED THEIR PS PRE ASK PS PROTOCOLS THIS YEAR. P. JEANNIE AND EARLY JUNE AS HAS ALREADY BEEN REFERENCE THE DINNER RISE TO SEPARATE AREAS TURNING OFF POWER. TO OVER TWENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AN S. C. E. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON HAS SINCE EARLY JULY BEEN UNDER ALMOST CONSTANT PS PS PROTOCOLS THERE IS A SHORT I THINK A COUPLE DAYS THEY WEREN'T. BUT PRETTY MUCH UNDER CONSTANT PS PS PROTOCOLS SINCE EARLY JULY. NO THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY DECIDED TO EXECUTE ON THE INTERPRETATION ON ANY OF THOSE YET. SO CAL YES ALONG WITH HER SEE IF YOU SEE AND CAL FIRE PARTNERS ARE REMAINING ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE I. O. USED TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS. OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THREAT IN MAINTAIN OUR READINESS TO RESPOND TO THE CASCADING CONSEQUENCES AS NEEDED. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO TALK THROUGH AS A LARGER COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING CAL S. OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS IN THE KIND OF. EDUCATED US ON ON EXACTLY HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS THANK YOU WELL NOW BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS WILL GO TO SUMIT SAYING THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ASSETS RISK MANAGEMENT A COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY FOR PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WELCOME MR SINGH. THE MORNING AND THANK YOU CENTER HEALTH AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS SESSION AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT COOPERATION AND CONTINUED COLLABORATION IS NOT GOING TO BE. A SUCCESSFUL MORE EFFECTIVE. OWN START BY STRESSING THAT AS A UTILITY HER MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY IS THE SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. SO WHAT WAS ECHOED. BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN REGARDS TO THE FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR INTENT AND FOCUSES. THE DEVASTATING FIRES A TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVE MADE IT EXTREMELY CLEAR THAT MORE MUST BE DONE AND MORE MUST BE DONE FASTER. TO THAT END WE HAVE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IN REGARDS TO A COMMITTEE WHILE FAR SAFETY PROGRAMS THAT WE HAD OUTLINED IN THE LOS FOUR SAFETY PLAN THAT WE HAD SUBMITTED. EARLIER THIS YEAR WHICH HAS SUFFERED SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WE HAVE NOT WAITED WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. WITHIN THE LOS OUR MEDICATION PLAN NOT ONLY DOES NOT INCLUDE. EXPANDING OUR CAPABILITIES ON REAL TIME MONITORING AND INTELLIGENCE AS MISS MALASHENKO MENTIONED IN REGARDS TO DEPLOYMENTS OF HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS. WATER STATIONS SATELLITE DETECTION CAPABILITIES BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTING NEW AND ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES TO BE ABLE TO DO A PRO ACTIVE ENHANCED INSPECTION OF ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHIN THE HI FI RISK AREAS USING DRONES HELICOPTERS WITH HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGERY THE TYPES OF CAPABILITIES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN EMPLOYED BEFORE. AS PART OF THIS INSPECTION REGIME. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE. VERY AGGRESSIVE IN REGARDS TO OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND GOING WELL BEYOND THE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS TO TRIMMING A TO IDENTIFY THOSE TREES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD FEEL INTO OUR LINES AND IDENTIFY THOSE SO WE ARE PROACTIVE ABOUT REMOVING AND IDENTIFYING THOSE HAZARDOUS TREES AS OPPOSED TO DEALING WITH THAT IN A REACTIVE SITUATION. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A FUNDAMENTAL REBUILD OF OUR ELECTRICAL UTILITY SYSTEM IN REGARDS TO THE SYSTEM HARDENING AND RESILIENCE CAPABILITIES WE ARE PRO ACTIVELY UNDER GROUNDING OUR LINES ON A TARGETED BASIS WE ARE REBUILDING OUR OVERHEAD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE SOMETHING CALLED COVERED CONDUCTOR SO WE REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD. OF POTENTIAL VEGETATION COMING IN CONTACT WITH OVERHEAD LINES AND WHEN THEY DO THE MINIMIZE THE SURFACE AREA FOR CAUSING A POTENTIAL ARC OR A SPARK IN ALL OF THESE. RISK REDUCTION MEASURES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AS WE SPEAK TODAY. MOST IMPORTANTLY TODAY WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM WE DO NOT LOOK AT THIS AS OUR ONLY RISK REDUCTION MEASURE IT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS OF WITHIN OUR TOOL KIT OF A RISK REDUCTION MEASURES AND WE REALLY LOOK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE WE ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND EXTREME NGUYEN TYPE OF CONDITIONS AND REALLY EMPLOYING THIS IN A MUCH MORE TARGETED AND A STRATEGIC WAY. AND I'LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP IN REGARDS TO THE DECISION CRITERIA AND RESTORATION WHICH I'LL SPEAK ON AS WELL. BUT LET ME FIRST TOUCH ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN REGARDS TO THE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH EFFORTS THE MORE THERE'S MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND- WE A WELCOME THE CONTINUED A PARTNERSHIP AND CO CREATION. ON THIS FRONT WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO ALL OF OUR FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS BY MAIL BY EMAIL PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. WERE PROVIDING A UNIQUE EDUCATIONAL KITS TO OUR MASTER METER CUSTOMERS THAT MAY BE LIVING IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND MAY HAVE A SINGLE METER LOCATION. WE ARE DOING PROACTIVE REACH OUT TO OUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE WE HAVE THAT UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION. AS WAS STATED BY SOME OF THE PANEL MEMBERS THE PROCESS WE HAVE FOR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS FOR NOTIFICATION IS ENSURING THAT THE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION WHEN WE DO REACH OUT TO THEM. EITHER VIA TEXT EMAIL PHONE CALL TO ENSURE THAT WE MAKE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION AND IN THE INSTANCE WE DO NOT MAKE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION WE DO A TRUCK ROLE IN ACTUALLY SEND PERSONNEL FROM OUR STAFF TO GO OUT TO THE RESPECTIVE. FACILITIES TO ENSURE THEY DO MAKE THAT POSITIVE CONTACT. WE'RE ALSO. ENGAGING AND HAD MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS CUSTOMER GROUPS ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. ENTITIES NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS CRITICAL FACILITIES TELECOM PROVIDERS WATER SERVICE. PROVIDERS WE'VE DONE PLANNING WORKSHOPS WITH THE LOCAL AGENCY OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT OUR SERVICE AREA AND THIS WORK IS CONTINUING. AND THERE'S MORE THAT WE KNOW THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE SPACE. THE TOPIC THAT CAME UP IN REGARDS TO THE SOCIALIZATION AND THE TIMING OF THAT WORK WE ARE VERY MINDFUL. THAT A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT AS WELL AND THE RISK OF DE ENERGIZING THE ELECTRIC GRID. SO ON THAT FRONT WE ARE WORKING ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS WE ARE OF TAKING A PAGE OUT OF THE PLAYBOOK OF THE SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN TERMS OF BECOMING MUCH MORE TARGETED IN REGARDS TO OUR GREAT. AS MISMO SHEKEL MENTIONED ARE GREAT IS OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF SIZE AND SCALE. WE HAVE NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD LINES THAT TRAVERSE THE HIGH FAR THREAT DISTRICTS OF PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IT'S- MORE THAN THE DISTANCE AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT'S REALLY THE SCALE THAT WE ARE MANAGING. WE ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLING SOCIALIZATION DEVICES WITH IT STALLED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THIS YEAR ALONE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO PROACTIVELY INSTALL THOSE DEVICES AND WHAT THOSE DEVICES DO IS THEY BASICALLY REDUCE. THE ABILITY FOR US AN INCREASE THE ABILITY AND REDUCE THE IMPACT. ON THE CIRCUIT ITSELF SO THEREBY MINIMIZING AND REDUCING. THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED. OF IN THAT THE IDEA GENERATION EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE INSTALLING A SIGNIFICANT NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS WE HAVE. MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS INSTALLED WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. AND THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY ON A TARGETED BASIS TO UNDERSTAND THE MICRO CLIMATE. AND WITH THAT COUPLED WITH THE SOCIALIZATION DEVICES BE MUCH MORE TARGETED AND PRECISE. NOT IN NARROWING IN ON OUR CAPABILITY OF THE ENERGIZING WHEN WE DO DE ENERGIZE. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY ARE CONSTRUCTING A RESILIENCE OWN UP IN THE PACIFIC A UNION COLLEGE IN AND WHEN IT SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL WITHIN THE MONTH AND THE INTENT BEHIND THIS RESILIENCE ON IS TO PARTNER UP WITH DAHLE OUR COMMUNITY ENTITIES TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CRITICAL ESSENTIAL SERVICES. LIKE HOSPITALS THAT IN AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES WITH IN THAT RESPECT OF COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR SERVICE TO THEM IN THE INSTANCE WHERE WE DO DE ENERGIZED SO THE OF RESILIENCE ON CONSISTS OF WHAT'S CALLED A PRE INSTALLED POP HUB. THAT GIVES THE CAPABILITY TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN AND CONNECT A MOBILE GENERATOR AND THEN DOWNSTREAM OF THAT WE HAVE TO A HALF MILES OF UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC LINES THAT PROVIDE SERVICE. TO THE CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT FOR ADDITIONAL. ZONES THIS YEAR ALONE WITH A- GOAL TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND BUILD ON THE PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING CUSTOMER RESORT COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER SOME SORRY. AS PART OF THE DEALER JUST ATION PROCESS WHICH PROVIDES SOME OF THE BASIC. SERVICES FROM MOBILE CHARGING WATER THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET UP TO DATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENT ITSELF MODELED. VERY SIMILARLY TO WHAT SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAS DONE. AND THEN WE ARE ALSO WORKING. VERY CLOSELY AND PARTNERING WITH THE A CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH OUR MEDICAL BASELINE OUR CUSTOMERS SO THAT WE WORK WITH THEM FROM A GRANT AND I ALLOCATION PERSPECTIVE AND THEY BEST IDENTIFY. HOW TO DISPERSE THOSE FUNDS IN REGARDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL BASELINE. CUSTOMERS AND THE SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES THAT THEY MAY HAVE. THE ABILITY TO. EXECUTE THE OTHER KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR PROGRAM AND OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE COLLABORATION WOULD NOT JUST THE MEMBERS THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE ON THIS PANEL BUT EVERYONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL OF THE LOCAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE THE COLLECTIVE US TO FOCUS ON THIS. LET ME TOUCH ON TWO OTHER ITEMS THAT CAME UP IN REGARDS TO THE DECISION CRITERIA AND RESTORATION AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO A ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE IN REGARDS TO THE DECISION CRITERIA IT IS NOT A AD HOC PROCESS IT IS A VERY STRUCTURED PROCESS THAT HAS A DETAILED OUR TIME LINE WITH THE APPROPRIATE TECH TALK IDENTIFIED IN REGARDS TO ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACCOUNTABILITY IS. AND WHEN WE DO ACTIVATE FOR EMERGENCY CENTER AND ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY A SWING INTO MOTION LEVERAGING OUR INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE AND EACH OF THE DATA POINTS IS MONITORED ALL OF THE COMMUNICATION INFORMATION HAS STRUCTURED PROTOCOL IN TERMS OF HOW. IT WILL INFORMATION IS COMING FROM HI WAS COMMUNICATED WITH OUR EXTERNAL ENTITIES EXTERNAL PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CRITICAL NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD BE WHO IS POTENTIALLY IMPACTED ARE THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE DO IN REGARDS WITH THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PROSPER NOTIFICATIONS WE STRIVE FOR UP A FORTY EIGHT HOUR NOTICE OUR CUSTOMERS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE YEAH THIS IS WEATHER DEPENDENT IN SOME CASES WE MAY NOT TRULY HAVE THE LUXURY OF THAT. CASTING THAT NOTICE THAT THE POLICE THINGS THAT WE SAW IN REGARDS SPECIFICALLY OUR DECISION CRITERIA WE ARE MOVING TO OF A PSYCHIC OF APPROACH THEY ARE URGING US SOMETHING CALLED A FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX IT'S A VERY. SIMILAR METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEEN EMPLOYED WITH SENDING. A GAS ELECTRIC AND THIS IS A INDEX THAT'S ACTUALLY PUBLISHED BY OUR METROLOGY TEAM ON A DAILY BASIS ON A ROLLING THREE DAY. TIME FRAME TO BE ABLE TO GIVE FOUR CASTING CAPABILITY OF THE UTILITY FIRE RISK FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ACROSS OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. AND BASED ON THAT WE ARE. HAVE THE INITIAL OPERATING RESTRICTIONS THAT WE ARE PUT FORWARD IN REGARDS TO OUR GRADE AND ANY PLANNED WAR COULD THAT BABY TAKING. OUR PLACE IN REGARDS TO HI FAR RISK AREA. WITHIN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE TERRITORY IT INCLUDES FACTORS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO. THE FACTORS ARE USED WITH THE NATIONAL FIRE DANGER RATING SYSTEM. WITH THE US FOR SERVICES LOOKING AT. A LIVE FEEL MORE SURE DID FEEL MORE SURE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPREAD THE FUEL LOADING. CONDITIONS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE ALSO DONE. SOME ANALYSIS ON LOOKING AT THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS TO WINS AND REALLY IDENTIFYING. WHERE WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IN OUR CIRCUITS DO WE SEE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD. AND PROBABILITY OF THE COLLEGE WHICH COULD BE A LEADING INDICATOR TO A POTENTIAL FIRE IGNITION. AS WE START TO SEE THE WIND SPEEDS PICK UP. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED FROM A SCIENCE STANDPOINT OF STATISTICS PERSPECTIVE. TO BE ABLE TO HELP FORMULATE THE UNDERLYING CAPABILITIES ON THE DECISION MAKING CRITERIA INCLUSIVE OF. TAKING. INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS. I'M IN REGARDS TO RESTORATION WE'VE GOT A ACTIVE FOCUS ON RESTORATION MOVE VERY MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WANT TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT WE ARE IMPACTING WHEN WE DO DE ENERGIZED AFTER THE ALL CLEAR ON THE WEATHER IS IN PLACE. WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM THAT SOLELY BEEN FOCUSED ON RESTAURANT ON RESTORATION STRATEGIES THE DEVELOPING AND HAVE DEVELOPED A LARGE PART. OF PLAYBOOKS FOR EACH OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS WERE HOLDING INTERNALEXERCISES WITH ALL OF OUR- OUR QUALIFIED LINEMEN AND PERSONNEL SO THAT WE ARE PRO ACTIVELY GOING OUT AND DOING GROUND PATROLS IDENTIFYING HOW LONG IT'S TAKING TO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS. BECAUSE TO THE POINT THAT WAS MADE BY MR SCHECK ANOTHER'S PREVIOUSLY OF MY ON THE PANEL. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO DAMAGE TO THE GRADE. PRIOR TO RESTORATION WE ARE ALSO EMPLOYING HEAD OF RECENTLY. CONTRACTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AERIAL FLEET. NEARLY THIRTY FIVE. HELICOPTERS EMPLOYED AS PART OF DOING AERIAL PATROLS TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT CAPABILITIES INCLUSIVE OF LOOKING AT LIGHT ARE. ALSO WE CAN DO NIGHTTIME PATROLS AND AGAIN FOR THE REDUCE AND MINIMIZE. THE AMOUNT OF TIME FROM A RESTORATION PERSPECTIVE. SO WITH THAT. WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH EVERYONE. THANK YOU INTERESTING IN ANOTHER MANY QUESTIONS AND I'D LIKE TO JUST EXERCISE THAT YOURS FOR AUG TWO OF. FOR A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE WE GET TO THE QUESTIONS IS MAYOR SAM LICCARDO FROM STAND AS A DOES HAVE TO LEAVE AND SO WE WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT EACH YEAR SO. PERHAPS IF YOU COULD COME UP IN YOUR IN THE SECOND PANEL BUT WE WILL MAYBE MAKE ROOM FOR YOU AT THIS POINT AND RIGHT OVER HERE DISH TO MR SAYING. AND. WHICH A YOUR NAME TAG THERE AND- YOUR TESTIMONY WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMING TODAY MISTER LICCARDO AND IN THERE THAT IT THAT. IT'S CRITICAL THAT OUR CITIES THE SPECIALLY OUR MAJOR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE END THAT WE'RE- COGNIZANT AND AWARE OF IN ALL OF US UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT. OF A P. S. P. S. EVENT AND WHAT THAT COULD MEAN FOR A CITY SO IF WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING TODAY MISSION HERE THE SHERIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR. INVITING ME THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME OUT OF ORDER AND MY APOLOGIES FOR HAVING TO DEPART BUT FORTUNATELY OUR DIRECTOR MERCY MANAGEMENT RAY REARED IN AS WELL AS OUR DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY LARA MITCHELL ARE HERE SO IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS THEY CAN ANSWER THEM FOR MORE INTELLIGENTLY THAN I CAN. I'LL BE HAPPY SIMPLY SHARE MY THOUGHTS. I THINK YOUR ALL VERY AWARE OF THE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF AN EXTENDED P. S. P. S. ADVANTAGE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES I YOUR DAILY GOING HERE FOR MANY EXPERTS AFTER ME. BUT I'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU WITH REGARD TO ONE PARTICULAR PHENOMENON THAT IS NINE ONE ONE CALLS. THE BEST CASE SCENARIO. WE BELIEVE IS THAT AFTER A. SAFETY SHUT DOWN THERE WOULD BE A SURGE OF NINE ONE ONE CALLS THAT WILL OVER WELL. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS COMING FROM RESIDENTS WITH RESPIRATORS COMING FROM RESIDENTS WITH MEDICINE MEDICATION IT NEEDS REFRIGERATION COMING FROM FOLKS WHO MAY BE CALLING BECAUSE POLICE ARE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE TRAFFIC COLLISIONS IN AND PERHAPS FASTENED IN DARKENED ARE AREAS OF THE CITY THE WORST SCENARIO OF COURSE IS THAT THERE'S NINE ONE ONE CALLS WE MADE INTO. OVERLOADED NETWORKS ALTERNATELY LOST. AND EVEN WORSE STILL THAT WITH AN EXTENDED DURATION THE P. S. P. S. OF SIX TWELVE OR MORE HOURS. THAT CELL TOWERS WILL ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN. SO IN VIEW OF THESE RISK MY AVERAGE HE REALLY FOLKS ISN'T THREE BASIC AREAS ONE IS THE LACK OF ACTIVE PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PS YES DECISION. AS SECONDLY ON THE NEED FOR IMPROVED COMMUNICATION WITH TACTIC COMMUNITIES AND THIRD ON RESOURCES FOR RESILIENCY. OF FIRST THE ISSUE OF WHO DECIDES I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE OBVIOUS THAT HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN CLEARLY STATED THAT THE CURRENT RULES LEAD THESE LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS OVER DE ENERGIES ATION. IN THE HANDS OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND NOT A PUBLICATION SEE. UTILITIES HAVE ASYMMETRIC FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AS WITH POINT OUT BY SENATOR WIENER. I SHUT DOWN TRANSMISSION LINES MITIGATE LIABILITY EVEN WERE DOING SO WILL SUBJECT. RESIDENTS IN CITIES LIKE MINE TO PARA. AND I APPRECIATE THAT NEITHER YASSER ISO OR PROBABLY ANY OTHER PUBLICATIONS HE WANTS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS VERY CONSEQUENTIAL PS PS DECISION BUT THESE ARE DECISIONS THAT ALLOCATE RISKS AMONG AND WITHIN COMMUNITIES. AND THE DECISION TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BEEN DELEGATED BY DEFAULT I TO COMPANY THAT'S BEEN CRIMINALLY CONVICTED FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS THAT FALSIFIED ELECTRIC AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE RECORDS FOR HALF A DECADE AND PAID SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS IN A DECADE WHICH THEY SLASH INVESTMENT ON KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE. I WE UNDERSTAND THE DECISION WILL BE MADE BY AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT P. JEANNIE ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN WE HAD NO IDEA THAT PERSON'S AN ENGINEER HAS ANY EXPERTISE. AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN ANY CASE I WOULD URGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER HOW TO REALLOCATE DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY FROM PRIVATE TO PUBLIC. NOT MERELY AN OVERSIGHT REVIEW BUT IN THE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE PS YES DECISION. IF THERE'S A RELUCTANCE TO DO SO AT THE FRONT END AND THE TIERS IS ATION. I WOULD ASK AT LEAST TO CONSIDER A GREATER PUBLIC ROLE IN THE BACK AND TO RE ENERGIZE. THE GRID AFTER IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN THE TRANSMISSION LINE. IT SEEMS THAT THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE ENERGY IS ATION COME NOT FROM THE DECISION TO FLIP THE SWITCH OFF BUT RATHER. THE DELAY DURATION ON WHICH IS SWITCHED OFF AND AT THE VERY MINIMUM. WE ASK THAT EVERY UTILITY'S LOCAL MERCY OPERATIONS CENTER WOULD ALSO INCLUDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFF TO INFORM. ABOUT THIS SITUATION ON THE GROUND UP. BUT WE KNOW A AS WAS JUST MENTIONED THAT INSPECTIONS REPAIRS ARE THE CRITICAL PATH TO RE ENERGIZING A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION LINE. RIGHT NOW THE PC IS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY FROM TIMELINE TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO ACT QUICKLY. TAKING FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS TO INSPECT WINDS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THEY SHOULD GET HELICOPTERS AND DRONES IN THE AIR WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WHERE SUFFICIENT REDUNDANCY EXISTS IN THE SYSTEM PUBLICATIONS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECT THE MAJORITY OF POWER TO BE RESTORED WHILE REPAIRS ARE ISOLATED ON SPECIFIC WINDS. THAT MY REMAINED DARK. A SECOND A COMMUNICATION. WE WOULD ASK. THAT THERE BE SOME LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO DIRECT UTILITIES TO IMPROVE NOTIFICATION COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS. GIVEN THE UNIQUE CONTROL THAT UTILITIES HAVE A RELEVANT INFORMATION THE UTILITIES MUST BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH BUILT IN REDUNDANCY FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE INFORMED IN PARALLEL AND WE CAN REINFORCE MESSAGES. TO MITIGATE THE REST THAT RESIDENTS FALL. TO ENSURE THE RESIDENTS DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. BUT IN PARTICULAR UTILITIES IN THE BEST POSITION HAS THE MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION NOTIFY THE CRITICAL INSTITUTIONS HOSPITALS. CHEMICAL PLANTS PUBLIC TRANSIT POLICE STATIONS INDIVIDUAL. IT IS AGREE THAT P. GENIES CURRENT PLANS FOR NOTIFYING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT AND LEAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN PERIL FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE ONLY PROVIDING OUTAGE INFORMATION BY UTILITY ACCOUNT NUMBER WITH NO SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO A PHYSICAL ADDRESS. OR A STREET BOUNDARIES. FINALLY A LOCAL COMMUNITIES NAY RESOURCES FOR RESILIENCY. AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY HERE NOT ALL THOSE RESOURCES REQUIRED THE LEGISLATURE TO CUT A CHECK. WE ARE SEEING EXAMPLES IN CITIES LIKE CARD FOR NEW YORK WHERE THEY'RE LEVERAGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND MICHAEL GRAETZ. I THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP BY PROVIDING POLICY CERTAINTY SPECIFICALLY BY REQUIRING UTILITIES TO ALLOW MICRO GRIDS TO INTERCONNECT WITH CLEAR RULES AND COST WITHOUT PROHIBITIVE FEES. MOREOVER WE NEED CALLOW YES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY WITHIN EXTENDED PS PS. AT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY NOW. STATE OF EMERGENCY POWERS WILL ENABLE CITIES TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE QUICKLY FOR STREAMLINED PROCUREMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR COMMANDEERING RESOURCES. AND FOR SPECIAL POWERS TO DECLARE CURFEWS. AND YES OF COURSE WE ALSO NEED MONEY WHETHER FOR ON SITE BACK UP AND GENERATION BATTERIES ARE MICHAEL GRAETZ FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES HE'S LIKE HAS A NEED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESILIENCE. FOR THOSE POLICE AND FIRE STATIONS WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS WERE POPS AIRPORT AND COMMUNITY CENTERS THAT WILL BE PROVIDING POWER FOR MEDICAL DEVICES IN THEIR CONDITIONING FOR FRACTAL RESIDENTS. I WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN CONDUCTING ASSESSMENTS WORKING IDENTIFYING FUNDING RESOURCES BUT ULTIMATELY THIS IS A STATE WIDE SAFETY ISSUE WE KNOW THAT COMMITTEES WILL NEED STATEWIDE INVESTMENT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION. ON YOUR CONSIDERATION OF MY YEARS. THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR ED IN JUST A QUESTION THEN WE'LL SEE IF THERE ARE OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONS OF YOU OF THE- YOU TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION. ASPECT OF IT ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE RESTORATION OF POWER AFTER THE D. ENERGY STATION. HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT IS TODAY DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A COMFORTABLE GOOD TO A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP ARE YOU PART OF THOSE. THAT COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALLY WITH YOUR NINE ONE ONE AND YOUR EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH WITH THE UTILITY. YES REGION HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE I THINK THE CHALLENGE AND I THINK FIVE YEAR IN SPEAK MORE TO THIS. I IS THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE IS SUFFICIENT A BY ANY STRETCH AND I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER CITIES OF FEEL THE SAME WAY. THE PROTOCOL IN REESTABLISHING IN THE TIME FOR ALL I'M SORRY RECEPTION SPECIFICALLY. I YES IT WE ARE SIMPLY NOT BEING GIVEN MUCH REASSURANCE. I HAVE A FRESH DURATION OBVIOUSLY WHICH THE GREATEST DOWN IS CRITICAL BUT WITH REGARD TO THE COMMUNICATION YES THERE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ROBUST COMMUNICATIONS READ YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION AS TO HOW WE- HAVE THAT COULD COME ABOUT. OTHER COULD BE CREATED IS THE ANY MENTION HAVING. A P. JEANNIE OR UTILITY REPRESENTATIVE IN YOUR OPERATIONS CENTER WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FOR YOU WOULD BE AND YOU WOULD HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THEIR CENTER THE LATTER IS WHAT WE'RE MOST INTERESTED IN. I SIMPLY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IS INFORMING. THE DECISIONS ABOUT ONE TO REENTER THE USERS JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE SERVED BY THAT THAT. THE IMAGES ASIAN AREA OR GREATER. THIS EFFECT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OF A OF MAYOR LICCARDO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. GOOD. SENATOR QUESTION THANK YOU I I'M GONNA ASK QUESTION ALSO P. JEANNIE AND OF OUR STATE AGENCIES HERE BUT. HOW WHAT UNDER WHAT DEFINITION ARE YOU YOU YOU LIST A LOT OF CRITICAL FACILITIES. AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHAT HOW ARE YOU DEFINING THAT IN SCOPING THAT THAT DATA SET IF YOU WILL YEAH WE WE'VE IDENTIFIED FACILITIES WHERE WE DON'T ALREADY HAVE BACKUP GENERATION OR POWER STORAGE. WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY RUN VARIOUS SCENARIOS IN WHICH WE ARE IMAGINING WHAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL URGENT RESPONSES AND NEEDS. FIRE STATIONS OF COURSE. AND. WE ARE WITH MANY PARTNERS LIKE THE WATER DISTRICT AND COUNTY AND SO FORTH IDENTIFYING THOSE. CRITICAL FIRST RESPONDERS. THAT WOULD BE MOST TENDER AND AGAIN I THINK RAY WE'RE IN ARTICLE PROBABLY BEST IDENTIFY THE PROCESS FOR DOING SO BUT WE'VE EXTENSIVELY ANALYZE THIS WE THINK WE'VE GOT A COST SOMEWHERE ON THE ORDER OF ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET THE PLACE. WHERE NGUYEN EXTENDED DOWN OF A DAY OR TWO WE AT LEAST HAVE THE FACILITIES ONLINE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO EMERGING. NEEDS AND THAT AND THAT COST CORRELATES TO. GETTING THEM TEMPORARY POWER TRIP KEEPING IS THAT IS THAT ABOUT LIKE I DIESEL GENERATOR YES I DON'T NURSING HOME YES SO ARE YOU NOT THINKING AND ABOUT ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES LIKE FUEL CELLS SO THERE'S NO ROOM. VERY MUCH CONSIDERING FUEL CELLS BUT PROBABLY EVEN MORE SOLAR WITH BETTER STORAGE. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE HOLY GRAIL WE KNOW THAT THAT TAKES. MORE TIME HI BUT FROM PLANNING AND MORE RESOURCES BUT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT'S WELL WORTH THE EFFORT WE NOW. NEXT DOOR FREMONT TO DOING. THAT WAS SEVERAL FIRE STATIONS AND WERE LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THAT MODEL. THANK SENATOR STERN AND THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR APPRECIATE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COMMENTS VERY INSIGHTFUL THANK YOU. SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR REQUIRE. YET TO MISS THING. YEAH IT SEEMS TO ME AS WE TALK WHO IS WE LOOK AT THESE MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS THAT ARE NEAR THE WILL EAT. IT SEEMS LIKE INVESTMENTS IN TRIED TO TARGET THOSE AND NOT HAVE. YOUR MAJOR SHUTDOWNS A MAJOR POPULATION AREAS THAT ARE NO WHERE NEAR. WHERE THERE'S REALLY A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF WILDLAND FIRE IS SHOULD BE PRIMARY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO OR YOU LOOK AT SANTA SAY YOU LOOK AT OAKLAND. YEAH THERE'S A HUGE POPULATION AREA AND. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THE COST OF GOING THROUGH AND SUPPORTING. YEAH PUBLIC SAFETY pDIFFERENT YOU KNOW ENTITIES JUST IS PROBABLY PALES IN COMPARISON TO. IT OUT AS MUCH SMALLER INVESTMENT IN YOUR IN TARGETING IN TARGETING THE GRIT SO I I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN THAT AREA AND THEN THE OTHER THINGS I THINK THAT THE WHAT THE MAYOR DID COME UP WITH IN TERMS OF HIS CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS AND I REALLY THINK WE'RE REALLY GONNA NEED THESE TYPE OF SERVICES YOU'LL BE OF MUCH LESS OF INVESTMENT IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES LIKE ANGLER. CALISTOGA IN MY DISTRICT OR MANY SMALL COMMUNITIES IN SENATOR MAGUIRE'S DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE GROUND ZERO AND LET ME TELL YOU. YOU DID THE POWER SHUT OFF IN CALISTOGA LAST YEAR I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER. PLAN EXECUTED TO GET THE POWER OFF BUT CANDIDLY TO GET IT BACK ON I'VE NEVER SEEN A WORSE YEAH PLANNED SO THAT NEED THE EL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND BY THE WAY. ALL THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN THE POWER WAS GONNA COME BACK ON THERE WAS NO REPRESENTATION BY PGD ANYWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN AT THE END. WE FOUND OUT TWO WEEKS LATER THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN LINES ON THE GROUND. ALL COULD HAVE BEEN IGNITION POINTS. FOR MORE FIRES AND NOBODY EVEN KNEW ABOUT IT SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU NEED TO HELP YOURSELF BY KEEPING THE COMMUNITIES AFTER THE SHUTDOWN INFORMED OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO SORRY ABOUT THAT TWO PART QUESTION NO PROBLEM THANK YOU CENTER FOR THAT FOR THE QUESTION AND- I DON'T HIT ON ALL OF THEM PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. LET ME KNOW CLINIC WE MORE WITH YOU I IN TERMS OF THE- CRITICAL NATURE OF THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED AND RIGHTFULLY SO AFTER OCTOBER EVENT LAST YEAR ON THE RESTORATION SIDE WHICH IS EXACTLY. WHY WE'VE PUT A DEDICATED FOCUS TO THAT IT WAS OUR FIRST EVENT THAT WE HAD EVER. IMPLEMENTED WITHIN P. GINNY OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED THAT CAME OUT OF THAT. AND ARE UNWAVERING FOCUS IS NOT JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS AND BEING VERY MINDFUL FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT. BUT ON THE BACKEND ON THE RE ENERGIZE ATION. INSPECTING OUR ASSETS AS SAFELY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RE ENERGIZING. IN IN THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AS POSSIBLE SO WE'VE GOT ALL OF OUR CONTROL CENTERS ENGAGED NOW WE'RE DOING INTERNAL EXERCISES WE'VE GOT OUR LOCAL PERSONNEL. THAT MANAGE THOSE CIRCUITS IN YOUR EACH OF YOUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS. TO INSURE THEY'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SWITCHING DEVICES SO THAT THERE'S A GAME PLAN IN TERMS AWARD WE GO AND REALLY LEVERAGE THE COMBINATION OF BOTH. ARIEL AND A GROUND FLEET TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR WE WERE PART PRIMARILY DEPEND UPON. ARE QUALIFIED A LINE MEN ON THE GROUND DOING GATE AND IT TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO INSPECT EVERY INCH OF THIRTY TWO HUNDRED MILES THAT WILL SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE MUCH. AND FAR BETTER CAPABILITIES GOING INTO THIS YEAR IN REGARDS TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE MAYOR RESPECTFULLY FROM THAT THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WE WELCOME INITIAL IDEAS IN TERMS OF HOW MORE EFFECTIVELY WE CAN COMMUNICATE WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS IN REGARDS TO OUR PROTOCOLS. HOW WE WOULD GO ABOUT THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE MANY DIFFERENT OF THE LOCAL ENTITIES WITHIN YOUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS TO SIGN NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS SO WE CAN GIVE THEM SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED THEIR ADDRESSES INCLUDING CRITICAL AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES SO THOSE ARE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AS AS PART OF THIS PROCESS SORRY IF I MISSED A ANY ANY OTHER QUESTION THAT YOU HAD IN THERE. JUST LIKE SPECIFICALLY CITY BIG CITY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND SAN JOSE HOW DO WE RE DIRECT POWER SO THAT MAJOR THAT I JUST THINK THAT JUST MAGNIFIES PROBLEMS IN IN IN OUR ANTICIPATION IS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A POTENTIAL PS PS WOULD IMPACT MORE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE HIGH FAR THREAT DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN THAT URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE. ME OBVIOUSLY WE'LL PUT THAT IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE GOT OUT AND COMMUNICATE TO THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IS THE INTER CONNECTED NATURE OF OUR GREAT WITH TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON HISTORY ACROSS THE BOARD RIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE WEATHER AND CLIMATOLOGY AND OUR CONCERN HERE IS IF WE DO SEE A EXTREME TOP OF A WEATHER EVENT THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN PREVIOUSLY. AND THERE IS A POTENTIAL IMPACT A TRANSMISSION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKINGVERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SERENA AND THE CAL I SO TEAM BECAUSE THEY'RE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THAT GRADE BUT IN THE INSTANCE WHERE THERE'S A POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE TRANSMISSION. LINE IS THE REASON WHY WE WANT OUT A. MADE THOSE COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS WE ANTICIPATE THE LIKELY WHO'S GOING TO BE LOWER ESPECIALLY WITH IN THOSE CITIES AND CONDOS DENSE URBAN AREAS. AND WHERE WE HAVE OUR DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS THAT ARE TRAVERSING THE HIGH FALL RISK AREAS BUT ALSO PROVIDE SERVICE. TO THOSE DENSER YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE INSTALLING OUR SOCIALIZATION DEVICES SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO BE ABLE TO ISOLATE THOSE CIRCUITS. THAT ARE TRAVERSING THE HIGH FAR RISK AREA AND PERCENT POWER. AROUND TO AN AREA OF A LOWER RISK THAT COULD STILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THAT URBAN. DENSITY OF BUT COMMUNITY SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT OUR FOCUS AND HOW WE'RE PRIORITIZING. WHERE WERE INSTALLING THE SOCIALIZATION DEVICES. WITH THAT ARE REQUIRED. THANK YU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR JUST TO HAVE SOME COMMENTS IN SOME QUESTIONS FOR A P. GENIES WELLS BECAUSE COMMISSION MISTER IF THAT'S OKAY AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING TODAY AND JUST SAYING JUST REALIZED THAT MY FRUSTRATION TODAY'S NOT DIRECTED TO PERSONALLY BUT TO THE TO P. JEANNIE AND AT REPRESENT AN AREA BETWEEN GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IN OREGON BORDER SHARING MY SENATOR DIED UP WE'VE BEEN HIT HARDER THAN. MOST ANYWHERE ELSE WHEN IT COMES A WHILE AND FIRES AND WE ARE IN THE REGION THAT HAS HAD THAT IS UNDER THREAT SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE FIRE SEASON AND I BELIEVE THAT TRUST HAS TO BE EARNED IN P. JEANNIE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO BE TRUSTED I WITHIN YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY QUITE CANDIDLY NOT A TO GIVE YOU SINCE THE SPECIFICS AND- YOU KEEP MENTIONING THAT YOU ARE COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE YOU'VE GONE OUT AND HAD SEVEN HUNDRED DIFFERENT MEETINGS WITH. PUBLIC AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SERVICE CLUBS EXCEPT SO THERE WAS A MEETING WITH THE MEDICINE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HERE ABOUT A MONTH MONTH AND A HALF AGO. AND EVERYONE NEARLY EVERY QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF THE. TEAM THAT SHOWED UP COULDN'T BE ANSWER AND GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES. ARE THE TEAM SAID THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE SIX HUNDRED FIRE CAMERAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE. DEPLOYED HOW MANY MENDOCINO COUNTY WE DON'T KNOW. BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON UNDERGROUND IN OF LINES HOW MANY MILES ALIGNS MINUTES YOU KNOW COUNTY WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO TURNING OFF THE POWER IN MENDOCINO COUNTY. THE COULD NOT SHARE. TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES IN MENDOCINO COUNTY THEY DIDN'T AND COULD NOT SHARE WITH THE PRAIRIES WOULD BE WHEN IT COMES TO. THAT TURNING OFF THE POWER. IN LAKE COUNTY NOW I WILL SAY IT WAS YOUR FIRST TIME UNFORTUNATELY POORLY COUNTY. WAS THE GUINEA PIG IN ALL OF THIS. LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS OF THE SHARE FINDING OUT THAT POWER IS GOING TO BE TURNED OFF HE JIMMY WOULD NOT SHARE THOSE RUN THREE MACHINES OVER SIX HUNDRED. AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TIME THEY LEARNED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT SIGNED A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. WHICH IS RIDICULOUS SO. ALL OF THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF. PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE UTILITIES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS THERE UTILITIES IN THE MIDWEST AND BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS. THIS IS BEEN SUCH A HAP HAZARD APPROACH. AND NOW WE'RE IN YEAR IN WERE KNEE DEEP IN THIS. AND I CAN BE HONEST. I THE FRUSTRATION IS GROWING. BECAUSE THE FOLKS WERE OUT ON THE FRONT LINES TRYING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE MESSAGE OF WHAT PHÑ SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MESSAGE THEY SHOULD TELL I'M GONNA CONTINUE YOU TOLD A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF LIKE PORT THAT THEY WOULD LOSE POWER THEY CANCEL CLASSES THE POWER EVERYONE OFF EVERYONE OFF AND THEN THEY COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF THE P. JEANNIE REPRESENTATIVE I'M GONNA CONTINUE OUR WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEVICES THAT ARE BEING INSTALLED HOW MUCH OF THE SERVICE TERRITORY IS THAT IMPACTING THERE WAS NO ANSWER YOU KNOW HOW MANY CUSTOMERS OF THOSE HUNDRED FIFTY DEVICES WHY ACTUALLY SERVE WITHIN THE SERVICE TERRITORY THIRTEEN SOLVE THE YOU HAD SAID THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER PINPOINT WELL AS POWER OUTAGES ARE IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IS WHAT IT MITIGATES AND I CAN I EXPLAIN HOW THAT -- COMES ABOUT BUT I MEAN I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I'M JUST WHERE THEY THE QUESTION WAS WHERE WAS GOING TO BE NOT TO YOU BUT THIS IS THE QUESTIONS WHERE WAS GOING TO BE WEARING THE SERVICE TERRITORY IS THERE ON THE NORTH COAST THEY COULDN'T ANSWER MR SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OFFICER RICKY SERVICES FOR A MOMENT I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT DABABNEH WARNING CENTER AND BY THE WAY WE LOVE MARKER DUTY HE'S AN ANGEL FOR EVER -- ON THE NORTH COAST AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO THE ENTIRE -- ESTEEM HE JENNY LEADING THE WARNING CENTER NOW IS CRITICAL BUT WHAT IS I BELIEVE JUSTICE CRITICAL IS MAKING SURE THAT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHEN AND HOW LONG TO EXPECT AN OUTAGE FOR SO THAT'S WHY CANDIDLY AND I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT IN DEPTH HERE WORD MANSON LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT MANDATED THAT P.

HAVING WORKED IN UTILITIES WITH UTILITIES IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES I KNOW THE HEALTH MUCH MORE ACCURATE RESTORATION AN OUTAGE ELM -- -- -- PREDICTIONS THAT THE TYPICALLY PUBLICLY SHARE ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL THE CUSTOMER THAT THE GETTING TO BE ABLE TO TURN THEM ALL AND ALL AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO AND EITHER JUST THE INNOCENT JUST TO USE THE EXAMPLE OF RESTORATION FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE UTILITY TYPICALLY DOES IS THE YOU KNOW YOU HOW THE WEATHER EVENT GO THROUGH YOU HAVE A LINES OUT TO GET THIS STARTED GOING OUT INSPECTING IN THOSE THAT COLLECTING MORE AND MORE INFORMATION THEY CONSISTENTLY UPDATING THEIR INTERNAL PLANS AS TO WHEN THE THINGS THEY CAN GET CUSTOMER OF ON AND IN WHAT ORDER BUT THOSE PLANS CHANGED IT IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE A THING FROM AN OPERATOR'S POINTS OF VIEW IS IF YOU SPEAK THROUGH EARLY AND THAT INFORMATION LEADER PROVED TO BE INCORRECT ELEMENT THEY NEED YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CHALLENGE OF EXPLAINING WHY YOU KNOW YOU PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THE CONFUSION OF THE POTENTIALLY CREATED SO A THINK WE ARE THE UTILITIES TYPICALLY ARE IS ON THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF THAT SPECTRUM WITH THE ONE TO BE SURE BEFORE THE SPEAK BY A THINK ILL YOU KNOW IT CREATES ALL ALONG -- OF EFFORTS THAN FOR OTHER AND CITIES LAY COOL WE ASK AND THE PC TO EXTRACT THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE UTILITIES AND TRY TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND I THINK IF MORE INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED OLD ACTIVELY BUY UTILITIES WILL MORE BROADLY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE OLD FRICTIONS HELLO MY A. B. HE THINK YOU KNOW OUTSIDE ALL OF WORKING EL UNIT IT SO THAT THAT I THINK IS ONE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE HAVING IS GETTING INFORMATION OUT THERE ARE -- JUST MORE INFORMATION A MAKING IT PUBLIC ALL YOU NEED THE SECOND IS SO FULL AWAITING THE L. DIRECTIONS OF MY OLD SCHOOL WE ASSN PHONES IT'LL FRAMEWORK THE VIN SOME CHALLENGES AROUND SO COULD OVER THE HOW THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN MESSAGING ELM ALL ROUNDS SO THERE OF VANS ESPECIALLY IN HOW THEY'RE ASSESSING THE RISK GOAL OF -- WILD FIRES AND THE RISK SPECIFICALLY TO THEIR FACILITIES VERSES THE OVERALL -- L. WILDFIRE THREAT CONDITIONS IN STATE THE ROOM PARTICULAR REGION SO YOU THINK YOU THE DOTS IN THE AREA WE ARE ALL WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE UTILITIES IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE NOW AND REALLY FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE STATE'S AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MESSAGING IS COORDINATED ELLIS THROUGH THE ENTIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM THE OTHER PART I WOULD SAY IS A COLLABORATION ACROSS IS THREE ARE YOU USE THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE A THINK OF BETWEEN -- WE US IN THE PEACE YOU'VE PROBABLY SPEND THE MOST TIME ON IS JUST TRYING TO GET ME THROUGH UTILITIES TO WORK TOGETHER AND SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND IS BEING EL RESISTANCE FROM FROM HOME TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN SO UNLESS WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THEM WHEN THE MEETING AND AND AND DRIVING TO A STANDARD PROCEDURE ON SOMETHING AND THEN HOVERING OVER THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING IT YOU KNOW LOVE TO THEIR OWN DEVICES THE GO ON INTO THEIR OWN SILO THEY'RE NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT YOU NEED TO HELP SEPARATE GEOGRAPHIES AND FOOT PRINTS AND SO IT'S VERY EASY FOR THEM TO JUST GO INTO THEIR DOMAIN AND NOT THINK ABOUT THERE'S THIS SISTER UTILITIES BEFORE US WERE MANAGING IT AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THESE DIFFERENCES THAT THEY MAY WORK FOR THEM OPERATIONALLY LOCALLY AND BROKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR SEEN YEAR AGO YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD THIS PROGRAM FOR QUITE A LONG TIME NO A LOT OF BEST PRACTICES THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES G. TO THE SCALE AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE KIND OF CHALLENGES LAKE EITHER IS D. G. NEED NOT WANTING TO CHANGE WHAT ALREADY WORKS FOR THEM AND IT'S BEEN PROVEN IN THE SCENE DIEGO COMMUNITY ALL BUT YOU KNOW WE IF WE HEALTH THREE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT ONLY UTILITIES WILL HELP IN THE STATE OF WOULD KIND OF START CARVING IN NOW THE EVERYBODY DOES IT DIFFERENTLY IT DISINTEGRATES AND BECOMES VERY VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ACROSS THE STATE LINE SLEEPING PRO ACTIVE COLLABORATION ACROSS OF THREE I WE USE AND ALSO FRANKLY WITH OTHER UTILITIES AND IN THE STATE SO THAT WE A STATE AGENCIES WILL HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE DRAGGING THE MAN TO HAVE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY ALL EXTREMELY HOPEFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU RIVERS CENTERS DON'T THANK YOU -- AND AND AGAINST HER THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND LET ME SAY THAT -- I I REALLY SENATOR MCGUIRE AND DODD FOR AN DURING A LOT OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THEIR DISTRICTS IT VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN IN MY DISTRICT I HAD THE CRANSTON FIRE AND THE HOLY FIRE -- THE CRANSTON FIRE WAS IN THE IDYLLWILD AREA THAT AS IN -- VERY LIMITED INGRESS AND EGRESS HAD THAT FIRE STARTED AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN INSTEAD OF THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT NOT NECESSARILY -- HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GUESTS WE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE A COUPLE THOUSAND US SO THIS THIS CONVERSATION OR HAVING TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS THAT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY IT'S A WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO DISCOVER OUR FAILURES WITH MORE FIRE OFFENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF NUMBER ONE -- A DEATH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS JUST AS IS A FAT AS A DEATH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE TO DO WE CAN NOW TO LIMIT THE THE MORBIDITY MORTALITY ASSOCIATE WITH WILDFIRES ARE BECOMING MUCH MORE COMMON -- IN THE STATE OF OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT -- TO MR SAYING IT IT DOES YOUR COMPANY -- LOOK AT WHAT I WOULD CALL RISK QUANTIFIERS OWNS IN OTHER WORDS AN AREA IN SAN FRANCISCO MAY NOT HAVE THE THE VULNERABILITY OF A WILDFIRE THAN SAY IDYLLWILD OF MY DISTRICT OR IN SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS OF SEND REQUIRES DISTRICT -- JU JU OUTLINED THOSE HIGH RISK AREAS WE WE DO -- SENATOR AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT GOES INTO OUR RISK PARTICIPATION PROCESS TO HELP INFORM OUR RISK REDUCTION MEASURES SO THINGS AROUND THE REFERENCE A SORT OF REQUIRE MADE ABOUT THE SIX HUNDRED HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS THAT'S INTENDED TO BE A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM -- BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO -- BUT WAR WERE INSTALLING AND WE'RE WE'VE INSTALLED A FIFTY THIS YEAR RIGHT AND ON A PATH TO DO ALMOST DOUBLE THAT IS INFORMED BY THOSE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WHICH IS WHAT WE SEE THE POTENTIAL OUR DYEABLE TYPE OF WIND PATTERNS WHAT WE SEE THE EXTREME WIND PATTERNS WHAT WE SEE EGRESS INGRESS -- IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT GO INTO THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND I AND APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- THE ENERGIZING IS ONE THING GETTING THE ENERGY BACK ON IS ANOTHER AND AGAIN I'LL PUT MY MY FRIEND FROM -- NAPA THAT -- IS IDENTIFIED THROUGH LEGISLATION IMPORTANT -- RISK FACTORS FOR PEOPLE THAT ON RESPIRATORS AND -- EQUIPMENT THE NEEDS ELECTRICITY FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEM THEIR LIVES -- THESE HIGH RISK -- PEOPLE HAS YOUR UTILITY EVER THOUGHT OF RESIDENCES PEOPLE AND COMING UP WITH THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL DE ENTERS ATION THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTACT THESE PEOPLE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS POSSIBILITY COULD IN FACT BECOMING SO WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING AND AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE AS OUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS REACHING OUT TO THE EXISTING MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE VARIOUS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CITY'S THE COMMUNITIES TO ENCOURAGE THE MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS TO SELF IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A -- CUSTOMER CARE SYSTEM WE WE HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE NOTIFIED US OF THEIR DEPENDENCY ON A PERSPECTIVE AND AS PART OF OUR NOTIFICATION PROCESS -- THIS WHAT I WAS ALLUDING TO EARLIER WE HAVE A PROACTIVE TOUCH POINT WITH THE MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS NOT ONLY DO WE SEND A NOTIFICATION OUT -- BUT WE EXPECT A POSITIVE CONFIRMATION AN DURING THE EVENT ONE IT'S WHEN WERE ACTED EMERGENCY CENTER THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COORDINATING ALL OF THIS AND ALSO TRACKING HOW MANY OF THOSE CUSTOMERS AND WHAT SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS HAVE WE OBTAIN POSITIVE CONFIRMATION FROM AND WHERE WE HAVEN'T WE SENT PERSONNEL OUT IN OUR TRUCKS TO GO KNOCK ON THEIR DOORS TO DO SO IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE TO THE POINT THE SENATE MCGUIRE MADE YOU KNOW TO THE -- AND THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUE OF THE EIGHT HOURS BEFORE LAKE COUNTY IDENTIFYING THAT INDIA NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE THOSE ARE THE CUSTOMER PRIVACY LAWS THAT WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW EXISTS WITHIN THE STATE THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE WE COULD USE SOME HELP BUT WE HAVE NOW NBA'S PRO ACTIVELY THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP I WOULD MORE THAN THIRTY COUNTIES AND WE'RE PROVIDING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION TO A SECURE PORTAL WITH MAPS WITH THE AREAS WHERE WE ANTICIPATE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF A POTENTIAL PS PS EVENT FOR FACILITIES ARE SEVENTY CAVEAT ABOVE INCLUDING THE CRITICAL ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SPECIFICALLY THE MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS YEAH AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE WITH EVERY MAJOR FIRE WE WE LEARN ABOUT HOW UNPREPARED WE ARE FOR THESE FIRES -- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND PROBABLY -- MANY OTHERS THAT ARE SITTING ON THE DAIS ARE FROM CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL WE USED TO HAVE EARTHQUAKE DRILLS SO WE USED TO SOME ALARM USED TO GET ANY THEIR DESKS AND COVER HEADS AND STUFF -- HAS EVER BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO HAVING A AN EXERCISE A A PRACTICE P. S. P. S. INCIDENT SO THAT INSTEAD OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGURE THINGS OUT -- WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN IN THE COMMUNITY -- AS AS ROSS PEROT WON SAID THERE'S AT THE LAKE ROSS PEROT SAID THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH STEALING A GOOD IDEA FROM SOMEBODY ELSE SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT WITH TO RELIVE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAD TO AND OR OR -- A DECADE OR TWO AGO -- ERIC ALSO BRINGS TO THE POINT CENTER MCGUIRE SAID YOU KNOW REACH OUT TO THESE OTHER STATES AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- BUT WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE YEARS TO PUT THESE CAMERAS IN PLACE WHEN YOU HAVE THE ELECTRICAL LINES TO PUT THOSE CAMERAS I MEAN WHAT IS A COST YOU PER HOUR EVERY EVERY HOUR THAT YOU BE ENERGIZED AND YOU CAN'T GET THAT ENERGY BACK ONTO YOUR YOUR STOCKHOLDERS I'M SURE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY PROBABLY PALE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT THESE REMOTE CAMERAS SAID THAT YOU'D BE COMBINED BEST BUY FOR FIVE BUCKS TEN BUCKS A CAMERA WITH -- THIS PROFESSIONALS THAT YOU HAVE -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE YOU COVER WHAT TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN AFFORD ANOTHER MAJOR INCIDENT -- IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT COMPLETELY DECIMATING YOUR COUNTRY WHICH COMPANY WHICH IS UNDER ASSAULT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW -- PRIOR PRIOR PROBLEM SO -- HOW CAN WE EXPEDITE YOUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE POSTI AN URGES ASIAN TO GET THAT ELECTRICITY BACK ON SAFELY SO YOU DON'T CREATE ANOTHER INCIDENT WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE POWER RIGHT AT YOUR DISPOSAL SO SO SO SO RESPECT LASERS STONE OUR OUR OUR FOCUS IS THE SAME AS YOURS WHICH IS TO ENSURE THERE'S NO ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT THAT'S THE UNWAVERING FOCUS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- WITHIN LESS THAN A SIX MONTH TIME FRAME WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ON RAMP NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS LINEMEN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORKERS TO DO THE WORK ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE AS SAFELY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SOME OF THIS WORK IS HIGH HAS RISEN NATURE -- AND WE ARE DEPLOYING IN EMPLOYING THE LATEST AND GREATEST TECHNOLOGY MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION ON THE AERIAL FLEET CAPABILITY WE HAVE THE CAPABILITIES WITH CAMERAS WITH LIGHT HOURS ALL COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT -- WE ARE GOING TO BE EMPLOYING AS PART OF A RESTORATION STRATEGY AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IDEAS ON WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO WE'VE TRIED TO TURN EVERY ROCK AS PART OF THIS EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUR THE BEST CAPABILITIES OF THE BEST MINDS AND NOW WELL SUMMARIZED BY JUST SAYING THAT WE WE DON'T WANT TO RECREATE THE WHEEL YOU HAVE THE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN YOUR RANKS TO FIGURE THIS OUT ES DE WILL INDEED DEBT ACTOR THEIR FACILITY THEY KNOW EVERY WHEN PATTERN THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE AREA OF JURISDICTION I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR AREA IS MUCH LARGER -- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WITH TECHNOLOGY -- WE NEED TO KNOW -- WHEN THE ATMOSPHERIC ADVANCE -- DECADE THAT A.

JEANNIE -- ON EXERCISING THE PROTOCOLS A NOTIFICATION BUT IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUGGESTING TURNING THE POWER OFF PRO ACTIVELY YEAH I THINK THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY SOME TO TALK ABOUT AND CONSIDER -- WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT OF EXERCISING IN TRAINING AND YOU WANT TO TRAIN LIKE YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT TOTAL YOU CAN BUY IT THAT WAY FOR SURE THANK YOU SENATOR STONE SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER -- BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR MCGUIRE YOU KNOW IT IS A MOTION ON IT IS PERSONAL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS IN YOUR BACKYARD SO ALL OF US ARE AFFECTED DIFFERENTLY AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS COMING UP TO YOU AND AND SHARING CONCERNS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT PERTAINS TO TO PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE AT RISK SO I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTION AND I THINK YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE -- I'M ALSO GOING TO AGREE HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE AND NOW DIE YOU CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER ANOTHER EVENT I MEAN WE'VE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO TO ANALYZE WHAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY THE LAST TIME WE TO BE DEALING WITH THIS BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I HEARD I THINK ALL OF YOU SEE AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER WHICH IS THE ON THE CHALLENGE OF COMMUNICATION I THINK I HEARD MISS ARM I HOPE I PRONOUNCED RIGHT MALASHENKO SAY COMMUNICATION I'VE HEARD ALL OF YOU APPEAR AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOW WHEN I HEARD MR DOT STATE THAT THERE IS TWENTY SEVEN LINES ON THE FLOOR THAT THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF I JUST WANT TO KNOW I MEAN HAVE AND IT'S SO SIMPLE BUT HOW DO YOU ENGAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT RESPECT IT JUST MAKES ME THINK OF WHAT THE MAYOR SAN JOSE STATED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR ON THE GROUND LEVEL WHERE THEY KNOW EXACTLY EVERY CORNER OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR SO WHEN WE'RE HAVING COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES HOPE PARTICULAR YOU ARE YOU CONNECTED TO LOCAL ENTITIES IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH I DID HEAR YOU STATE THAT YOU TEND TO BE ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE AND NOT RELEASE INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WRONG YOU WANT TO BE SURE BUT I DON'T SEE THE HARM AND HAVING A POINT OF CONTACT WHERE YOU'RE COMMUNICATING FROM BEGINNING TO END THE MINUTE YOU THINK SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG -- EIGHTIES AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL SO THEY THEN THEY CAN BE READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PLAN OF ACTION IN CASE OR SOMETHING HAPPENING SO CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT EXACTLY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU ENGAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE MINUTE YOU KNOW SOMETHING COULD POTENTIALLY GO WRONG SO I GUESS I CAN START -- BUT WHEN WE ARE FORECASTING A POTENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF AND -- AND WHEN WE ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WE HAVE A DESIGNATED POSITION WITHIN OUR INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE OF CALLED LIAISON OFFICER AND THEN THAT -- INDIVIDUAL HAS A TEAM -- AND THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH ALL OF THE RESPECTIVE -- EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS WE ALSO HAVE A TEAM ON THE CUSTOMER CARE SIDE THAT'S MANAGING AND AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE COMMUNICATING WITH ALL THE LARGE CUSTOMERS WITH ALL THE MEDICAL WONDERFUL BASE FIND CUSTOMERS ON THE LOCAL SIDE WE WORK WITH THE -- ESTABLISHED LOCAL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- BECAUSE AS MORE ACTIVATING OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR A POTENTIAL PS PS OF AND TO THE LOCAL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- IS TYPICALLY ACTIVATING AS WELL IN ADDITION TO THE NOTIFICATIONS AND THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WE'RE SHARING WITH THE STATE -- U. S. CALLOW YES CPUC ARE ENTITIES WERE ENGAGING WITH THEM TO THE DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE EMERGENCY CENTERS THIRTY YOU AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFY LIST HIM MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WHEN THERE'S A POTENTIAL FORESEE HAPPENING NOT MOSTLY A OF POTENTIAL INCIDENT FOR SEEING HAPPENING IT'S IT'S IT'S WHEN WE ARE ACTIVATING AID GEOGRAPHIC AREA ORG ACTIVATING OUR EMERGENCY CENTER FOR WHEN WE ARE FORECASTING HE POTENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF SO THAT WE CAN START TO DO THE PREPAREDNESS FOR DOING ALL OF THE PROACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND IN SOME CASES -- THAT COMMUNICATION MAY NOT TURN INTO A NOTIFICATION INTO AN ACTUAL THE LEGISLATION THAT'S REALLY WHERE ARE STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL -- COMES INTO PLAY SO THAT THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLE THAT I'M SPEAKING OF ATTENDANCE IS A QUESTION WELL IT SOUNDS GREAT WHERE YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT NOW BUT FROM ALL THE TESTIMONY AND STORIES WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EVEN MISTER DOT APPEAR ON THE TIRES THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING AND PLAYS THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO START CONSIDERING VERY STRONGLY WHAT THE MAYOR OF SAN JOSE STATE AT THAT AT SOME POINT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP OR THERE'S DIRECT COMMUNICATION THEY KNOW IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE OFFICES A START WORKING IN ISOLATION BUT AS A LOCAL FORMER GOVERNMENT INDIVIDUAL MYSELF THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION WITH -- WITH POLICE AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WHEN AN INCIDENT HAPPENS OUR RESOURCES START BEING STRESSED EVERYONE WAS CALLING ON ONLINE YOU HAVE EVERYONE RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS IN YOUR LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AND I KNOW IT'S HAPPENED TO ME PERSONALLY IN THE PAST BUT I REALLY DO THINK AT LEAST FOR COLLEAGUES APPEAR AS WELL AS YOU I THINK WE NEED TO START CONSIDERING WHAT THE MERIT SAN JOSE STATE AND THAT IS WE HAVE TO BECOME PARTNERS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THAT DISCONNECT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN AND AS MUCH AS YOU'RE SAYING WE HAVE THINGS IN PLACE WERE NOT SEEN THAT IN ACTUALITY IN THE GROUND BUT UP BUT THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU THERE WAS THE OLD ADDRESS AND REVIEWS I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS I SAID I DON'T WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY THINKING THAT THAT IT'S PERFECT WITH EVERY SINGLE COUNTY WITH EVERY SINGLE ENTITY YOU KNOW IT IS IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EVERY SINGLE DAY IS IT BETTER GOING INTO THIS YEAR'S U. S. P. S. COMMA SEASON IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT AS COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR I FINALLY BELIEVE SO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT AND FOCUS -- ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT IS THERE MORE TO BE DONE ABSOLUTELY WELL I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO MORE BECAUSE ONE MORE LIFE LOSSES UNACCEPTABLE MAKING RUBIO SENATOR STERN AND WE HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON P. JEANNIE THIS MORNING BUT CALIFORNIA EDISON AND ES DE JEANNIE ARE HERE AS WELL AS ARE COUNTIES AND WE'RE GETTING A CITY PERSPECTIVE BUT ONE SUGGESTION MIGHT BE -- MAYBE IN THE WAKE OF HIS HEARING TO GET SOME WRITTEN FEEDBACK FROM ALL THE I. O. USE AS WELL AS THE PO USE AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW ALL OF THEM ARE PLANNING MANAGEMENT -- BECAUSE THE QUESTION I HAVE -- FOR FOR YOU ALL IS THE SAME AS AS FOR MAYOR LICCARDO ABOUT THE SCOPE OF VULNERABILITY HOW YOUR INITIALLY MAPPING THE RISK AND WHO IS WHO IS IN AND WHO IS OUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS THAT I'M I'M LOOKING BACK AT SB NINE NO ONE IN THE DEFINITION HERE OF WHAT HAS TO BE INCLUDED IN A WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN THAT SIR DODD IS PROPOSING TO ADD GRANULARITY TO AN SP ONE SIXTY SEVEN BUT AT THIS POINT THE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACTS ON CRITICAL FIRST RESPONDERS AND ON HEALTH AND COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE S. PROPOSED TO BE REFINED THAT WOULD BE EXPANDED TO TO SAY CRITICAL FIRST RESPONDERS HELPING COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVE MEDICAL BASELINE ALLOWANCES -- FIRST QUESTION IS A MEDICAL BASS LINE IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM IS IT NOT IS THE PGA ANY RIGHT WHEN WE STARTED THE P. UC'S MEDICAL BASELINE AN OPT IN PROGRAM YES IN THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED IS THE RACE ASSISTANCE A PROGRAM FOR HOME CUSTOMERS WHO NEEDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS GO MORE SO IS A RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT IS A PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WHERE SAY MEDICAL OR HEALTH NEEDS ARE OUR MOST CRITICAL CORRECT CORRECTLY AT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM IS A WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN MIND AND SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A POPULATION I WANT TO GET A SENSE MAYBE FROM YOU MR SAYING OR COMPREHENSIVELY FROM EITHER -- YES TO THE P. YOU SEE HOW MANY CUSTOMERS OUT THERE WITH CRITICAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY WITHIN YOUR MEDICAL BASELINE ALLOWANCE AGAIN THIS ALSO SENATOR START FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DIFFICULT TO BUILD IDENTIFIED THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THOSE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMERS MAY NOT HAVE -- IDENTIFIED -- REGISTERED WITH US WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS WE HAVE FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS OF THAT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND OVERALL I'M TALKING ABOUT WITHIN OUR ENTIRE SERVICE TERRITORY -- THIS INCLUDES -- OUTSIDE OF THE HI FI RISK AREAS -- THAT WE HAVE REGISTERED AS MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS AND THE DEFINITION THAT WE HAVE HERE IS RIGHT THERE LIFE SUPPORT CUSTOMERS -- THAT ARE USING ANY MEDICAL DEVICE THAT'S USED TO SUSTAIN LIFE AND -- IT'S A SIGN BY A LICENSED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER AND THE EQUIPMENT IS FOR HOME USE ONLY WITH US THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND IT SO YOU A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IS THAT SO OKAY SO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND TO FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION NICER THE POINT FOUR MILLION AND THEN WRIT LARGE IN THE I OWE YOU -- WORLD IN GENERAL MISS MALASHENKO HOW MANY CUSTOMERS IN OHIO YOU TERRITORIES ACROSS THE STATE I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME BUT IT'S SIMILAR MAGNITUDE SO AND THEN DO WE KNOW HOW MANY TOTAL MEDICAL BASELINE ALLOWANCE CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN ALL THE AYE YOU TERRITORY DO YOU GUYS HAVE THAT INFORMATION I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME RIGHT NOW NO BUT IT'S SIMILAR ABOUT MAGNITUDES TO -- P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF PROPORTION OF MEDICAL BE SLAIN CUSTOMERS TO THE OVERALL CUSTOMER ACCOUNT AND IS YOUR SENSE THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING WHO IS OPTED IN THE MEDICAL BASS LINE VERSUS WHO IS ACTUALLY MEDICALLY VULNERABLE I I KNOW THE MAYOR TOM RIGHT THOSE WHO NEED REFRIGERATION SAY OF OF OF PRESCRIPTION NOT EVEN BE ON A RESPIRATOR PER SE OR SOMEONE'S IT WAS ON DIALYSIS BUT NOT INTO ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY THAT MIGHT NOT BE CAPTURES YOUR SENSE THAT IS AN INCOMPLETE COUNT -- IF WE SOLELY USE MEDICAL BASELINE AS THE SORT OF -- BASS LINE IF YOU WILL OF WHO'S VULNERABLE THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS IT IS INCOMPLETE AND FOR TWO REASONS SO FULL ONE IS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE NOT DESIGNED AS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF PROGRAM SO THERE MEDIA CUSTOMERS WHO COULD BE SOMEHOW MEDICALLY DEPENDENT HOME WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGISTERED BUT THE SECOND REASON IS ALSO THE MASTER METER -- ISSUE WHERE AT LARGE BUILDINGS MOBILE HOME PARKS AND OTHER FACILITIES -- COULD BE BEHIND ONE METER WITH A HUNDRED SO FULL OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEM SOME OF THEM COULD BE L. MEDICALLY DEPENDENT OTHERS MAY NOT BE BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UTILITY SEES THEY DON'T SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE BEHIND THE MEAT OR OMIT SO THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WITH THAT MAKES THIS INFORMATION HIGHLY IT THAT UTILITIES OF HIGHLY INCOMPLETE WE I SEE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS THAT'S WHAT WE SEE RIGHT AND SO YOU TAKE SOMEWHERE LIKE THE JEWISH HOME FOR THE AGING THE LARGEST SENIORS -- CARE FACILITY OVERNIGHT IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS LIVING A SINGLE FACILITY WITH ONE METER SUMMER -- YOU KNOW SELF DEALING WITH SEVERE DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS SUMMER AGING IS A PLACE AND -- YOU KNOW VARYING DEGREES OF RISK AND AND NOT NECESSARILY OSP PIES OR FEDERALLY REGULATED AT BACK OF DIESEL GENERATION SO THOSE PEOPLE MY GRANDMOTHER IS ALWAYS ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW ZOOMING OUT EVEN BEYOND OUR SORT OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HOW IS -- YES LOOKING AT THIS SORT OF BROADER SCOPE OF VULNERABILITIES SO WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU WELL DEFINED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CRITICAL ASSETS SO FROM A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE WE USE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S -- CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS OF THESE THE SECTION OUT BY SECTOR RED SERVICES TRANSPORTATION ENERGY SO WE USE THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS IN FORM OF THE CURRENCY IF YOU SEE DECISION IN TERMS OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CRITICAL FACILITIES IN THAT DECISION POPULATION AGREED THAT IT THAT THE DEFINITION IT IS NOT FULLY DEFINED IN THAT THERE ARE BROAD GROUPS THAT ARE NOT INCLUSIVE IN THE CURRENT CATEGORIES THAT ARE BEING USED AGENCY -- PARTNERS TO TRYING TO ZERO IN ON -- GETTING MORE SPECIFICITY ON THAT BUT WE DON'T HAVE HE WELL DEFINED -- FULLY COMPREHENSIVE DEFINITION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DO YOU THINK YOU NEED ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO MARRY THOSE DATA SETS STATE EXPOUND YEAH WELL SO I'M THINKING OF AS COUNTY HEALTH DATA OF WHAT YOU KNOW WHO WHAT SENIORS ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING SUPPORT THROUGH SOME SERVICE OR OTHER OTHER DATA SETS THAT MIGHT INDICATE TO YOU -- SOMETHING BEYOND THE MEDICAL BASS LINE I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER WE NEED SUCH AUTHORITY IT -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE WE ARE WORKING WITH -- BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ON THE DATA SETS THAT THEY HAVE IN EXPLORING WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA SETS THEY MAY HAVE THAT WE NEED TO COMBINE -- RIGHT NOW I KNOW SOME OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON SORT FOR FOR EXAMPLE MEDIC MEDICARE AS WELL AS MEDI CAL THE DATA SETS TO LOOK AT BUT AGAIN TRYING TO THAN THAT TO STILL THAT DOWN TO WHICH ONES THAT ARE VULNERABLE FROM A POWER PERSPECTIVE RIGHT -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SLATE ALL OF THEM RIGHT -- SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND OUR SEE PAGE PARTNERS -- ON THE AND POWER PROGRAM WHICH IS OF ALLOW WHICH WOULD PROVIDE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY MON ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES -- BUT AGAIN THOSE THOSE DATA SETS AREN'T FULLY COMPREHENSIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE EMPOWER PROGRAM THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNS WHICH WOULD ALLOW US ACCESS OF THE A DATA SETS OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM OR MEDICARE PROGRAM CONTACT INFORMATION TO GIVE THEIR THEIR ADDRESS BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE THEIR PHONE NUMBER RIGHT SO THE DATA SETS CAN GIVE US A BROADER SCOPE BUT THE CATEGORIES OF OF INFORMATION ELEMENTS IN THOSE DATA SETS AGAIN THEY WERE DESIGNED FROM AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSPECTIVE SO WE WOULD NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW TO BROADEN THE DATA SET TO BE ABLE TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY UNDER EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSIDERATIONS I KNOW YOU'VE REACHED OUT TO COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL WITH SOMEONE OF A SOLICITATION IF YOU WILL OF SORT OF WHAT THEY SEE IN THEIR MAP OF CRITICAL POPULATIONS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE DOES THAT -- INTERFACE STAND DO YOU HAVE -- YES WE HAVE A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM UNIT WITHIN OUR STATE FRED ASSESSMENT CENTER ON THAT HAS DEFINED -- -- STATE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THERE'S A BROADER THAT'S THAT'S A SORT OF THE THE HIGHEST CRITIC CRITICALITY IF YOU WILL AND THEN WE HAVE BROADER DATA SETS THAT WE USE WITHIN ARCGIS DEPARTMENT THAT IDENTIFIES ALL THE FIRE POLICE STATE POLICE STATIONS FIRE STATIONS HEALTHCARE FACILITIES I'M SO WE CAN OVERLY THOSE IN OVER THE MAPS THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE UTILITIES ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY DO YOU HAVE ADEQUATE DATA THOUGH FROM THE COUNTIES ON THAT FRONT AT THIS POINT TO HAVE A SO THAT WE AT THE STATE LEVEL OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATA SAID THAT WOULD BE TOO BROAD A STATEMENT TO SAY IT ADEQUATE ACROSS THE BOARD SO NOT SO THERE ARE PROBABLY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ELEMENTS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA SET GOOD BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF OUR DATA SETS COME FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE -- SO IT WOULD IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO DRAW THE LINE OF TRACKING ALL FACILITIES SO IF YOU'D INDUSTRY FINAL QUESTION HERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE GOT A HUGE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IN THE RIGHT WAY TO YOUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER SAID IT'S STILL AN ADEQUATE OR THAT AN EFFORT THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN -- CAN BE USED TO SORT OF REMEDY SOME OF THESE GAPS -- BUT EVEN IF WE DO IDENTIFY ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THEN WE GO TALK TO THEM AND SEND THEM JUST PULLED UP PREPARE FOR POWER DOWN -- SEND THEM THIS THIS WEBSITE -- I SEE A BIG PICTURE OF OF -- BACKPACK SOME CANS A BATTERY A POCKET KNIFE AND SOME WATER -- AS THIS SORT OF -- BASIC RECOMMENDATION HERE YOU GO YOUR POWER IS GOING TO BE OFF FOR HALF A DAY MAYBE THREE DAYS IT'LL BE OFTEN IT SAYS WHAT IF I'M DEPEND ELECTRICITY FOR MEDICAL DEVICES SAYS CONSIDER A SAFE BACKUP POWER SOURCE SUCH AS A GENERATOR OR UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT COMMUNICATING IN THE MESSAGE I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE TO CLICK HERE TO SAY HOW DO I GET ONE OF THOSE DEVICES HOW DO I ACTUALLY BACK MY POWER UP SO I I HAVE TO GO OUT I'M EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN LIVING THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY DEPENDING ON YOUR CONDITION I GOT A OKAY I GOT I GOT THE NOTICE WE IDENTIFY THE PERSON NOW THEY GO OUT NAY SAY I GO TO THE HOME DEPOT AND GET A GENERATOR I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE I DO THERE'S NO WHERE TO CLICK LIKE ONCE WE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIES PEOPLE NOTIFY THEM I DON'T SEE THE TOOLS TO ACTUALLY EMPOWER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES AND I DON'T THINK THAT SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT PUTTING A SOLAR BATTERY SYSTEM AT A NURSING HOME WILL JUST TAKE TOO LONG SO LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT DOWN THE LINE LET'S KICK THAT CAN DOWN THE ROAD WE KNOW FULL WELL THAT WE CAN GET THE SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING NOW AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING TO NURSING HOMES HERE TOO I'M TALKING ABOUT GASOLINE STATIONS IN OUR OIL REFINERIES EVEN THAT IT WE RELIED FOR OUR ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE REGION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUMPING STATIONS ACTUALLY KEEP THE WATER MOVING BUT THINGS THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN DO OR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC FACILITIES CAN DO I STILL THINK WE'RE LACKING A A STATE WIDE DEFINITION THAT ACTUALLY IDENTIFIES THEM COMPREHENSIVELY THE BE A SOLUTION SET BECAUSE THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN THE BUDGET CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT WAS REALLY INTENDED MOSTLY JUST FOR STATE FACILITIES THAT THAT SORT OF TOP TIER LIST IS THAT CORRECT MISS THOMAS JACOBS THIS IS STILL BEING EVALUATED IT'S LOOKING AT BOTH STATE AND LOCAL NEEDS IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IS SOMEWHAT OF A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE TOTAL NEED FOR BACKUP POWER GENERATION CITY SO THAT'S TO ME THE PROJECT HERE THAT I HOPE WE CAN ALL ENDEAVOR IN TOGETHER IS HOW TO FILL THAT GAP QUICKLY -- AND I DON'T THINK DIESEL POWER GENERATION SOLELY IS GONNA BE THE ANSWER I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS AND HOPING THIS NEXT PANEL WE CAN START TO DIG INTO THAT BUT FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE FROM ALL THOSE FOLKS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT NOT BE CAPTURED -- AND FROM THOSE CRITICAL INDUSTRY SAYS NOT JUST PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT BUT THOSE PRIVATE FACILITIES THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED -- I THINK WE OUGHT TO DELIVER THIS SESSION THANK YOU SENATOR AND AND WE WILL NOW BEFORE I GO TO MY QUESTIONS WILL GO TO SENATOR WIENER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I APOLOGIZE THAT I HAD TO STEP OUT IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE SO AND I HOPE I DON'T -- AS QUESTIONS ARE ALREADY ASKED -- I SUGGEST -- IF YOU THESE ARE ALL THE P. GINNY AND AGAIN NOTHING PERSONAL MISTER SAYING AYE AYE AND YOUR HER REPRESENTING A COMPANY THAT HAS SOME REAL -- ALL THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK -- THAT'S HAPPENING ABOUT THE -- I FORGET THE TERM BETTER SEGMENTATION SO THAT THE SHUTDOWNS CAN BE MORE STRATEGIC AND THEN OF COURSE THE OVERALL -- HARDENING TRIED INFRASTRUCTURE OF P. GINNY CAUSING WILDFIRES I GUESS ONE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHY WASN'T THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WORK DONE A LONG TIME AGO -- AND I I'M NOT I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE BUT I I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES AN ANSWER ABOUT WHAT IN TERMS WHY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN A LONG TIME AGO -- YOU KNOW REPAIRS OF THE PAYING MONEY FOR A LONG TIME AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE P. GINNY SYSTEM IS OLDER AND -- IT'S A HUGE SERVICE AREA AND NOTES MANY CHALLENGES -- BUT WHAT TOPPING THEY SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO NOT ONLY WITH THAT OF A WAITED -- LIKELY TO MAYES WILDFIRES BUT WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY MASSIVE OVERLY BROAD POWER SHUT DOWN SO BECAUSE WE'LL REFINERIES TO FLARE -- OR THE BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE TO SHUT DOWN A POTENTIALLY CLOSE UP SHOP ENTIRELY OR CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR MEDICATION -- WHAT -- SO WHY SENATOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I HARD FROM TO SPECULATE AS TO WHY DOES NOT THE AREA THAT HAVE FOCUSED IN -- I TRANSITION INTO THIS ROLE OF SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR OF FROM OUR GAS OPERATIONS FOR THE ORGANIZATION -- AND CHARTED WITH THE FOCUS ON LOOKING AT AND RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK VERY SIMILAR FRAMEWORK THAT'S EMPLOYED IN THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY THE NATURAL GAS THE IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THAT'S REALLY WHAT MY FOCUS HAS BEEN WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WALL FAR CAUSED BY OUR ELECTRICAL ACID IN INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S REALLY BEEN -- GO FORWARD -- FOR ME THE AS I'VE LOOKED AT THE THE THE INFORMATION THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE -- ON ON THE ON THE SPECIFIC TOPIC BECAUSE I KNOW THIS TOPIC IN THIS QUESTION IS ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN MY AREA OF FOCUS WE WE HAVE YOU SEEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE COURSE OF THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND -- THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF FIRE THREAT DISTRICT MAPS THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THE CLIMATE IN WHICH ARE LOGICAL ASSETS ARE WE'RE SURROUNDED WITH A DRASTICALLY CHANGED -- AND I'M NOT BLAMING ALL OF THAT ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE -- SO AND THERE'S THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING NOW THAT -- WE'RE COMMENSURATE WITH REDUCING THAT RISK BOTH IN TERMS OF INSPECTIONS IN TERMS OF EDUCATION IN TERMS OF HARDENING THOSE ARE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE PUT INTO ACTION THIS -- PART OF THIS -- EFFORT YEAH AND I -- -- GUY ARE YOUR MORE RECENT IT'S JUST I JUST FIND IT REALLY UNACCEPTABLE THE LEVEL OF -- INFRASTRUCTURE DETERIORATION THAT WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN THAT P. GINNY AND AND NOW NOT ONLY DO WE SEE THE WILD FIRES BUT WE SEE THESE POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC OF POWER SHUT DOWN AND ONE WHEN I SHUT DOWN HAPPENS WHAT'S THE FOCUSING ON BUSINESSES BOTH SMALL AND LARGE SIR UP WHAT IS THEIR RECOURSE SO YOU HAVE OF WHAT WE SAW YOU KNOW THE THE -- THE WILLINGNESS AND I'M NOT USUALLY ALIGNED WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY BUT THEIR THEIR LETTER WAS -- WAS VERY COMPELLING -- THAT YOU ARE YOU KNOW I I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY PROBLEMATIC TO TO TO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THAT'S JUST A ABOUT THAT ONE THE CIVIC STREAM EXAMPLE THERE'S ALSO -- THAN WHAT I MENTIONED THAT AT THE BEGINNING LESSONS YOU KNOW DOES LACK OF INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER IT IN THESE BUSINESSES THEM AND SO WHAT WHAT IS THERE WHAT IS A RECOURSE AND WHAT'S A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR FOR PGA ANY NOT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF OVERLY BROAD POWER SHUT OFF SO SO RESPECTFULLY CENTERS NOT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE IT'S REALLY A PUBLIC SAFETY OF FOCUS FOR US I I UNDERSTAND YOU PARTICULAR KIND OF THE THE THE TWO SIDES OF IT FROM MY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY WE LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE RISK OF DEHYDRATION AS A RESULT TO PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACT OR AS A RESULT OF NOT DE ENERGIZING AND POTENTIALLY CAUSING A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SO THAT THAT'S- REALLY THE RISKS THAT WE ARE WEIGHING. IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RECOURSE. THAT'S LEFT UP TO WERE WERE TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE ON THE COMMUNICATION WE LAST WEEK WE HAD A DISCUSSION AND A SPECIFIC MEETING WITH THE VARIOUS LARGE REFINERIES THAT ARE TOPPED OFF OF A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TO BE DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF THE- HEALTH OF OUR SYSTEM IN AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MADE IT BY NATURE. IS SPECIAL HUNDRED KV AND ABOVE AS MYSTERY NOT TALKED ABOUT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF RELIABILITY THAT'S BUILT INTO IT BECAUSE FROM A- A RELIABILITY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE LOOKING TO REALLY OPERATE THE SYSTEM ON A AND MINUS ONE CONTINGENCY MEETING IF YOU LOSE YOU KNOW A LINE YOU HAVE. BEEN IN OTHER FROM A BACKUP PERSPECTIVE AND- THE WHOLE INTENT BEHIND ENGAGING FOR EXAMPLE TO REFINE RECENCY USE THAT USE THAT EXAMPLE IS TO. MAKE THEM AWARE THAT THIS IS THE REALITY UNFORTUNATE REALITY OF WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY FACED WITH AND WHAT WERE LIVING WITH A WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO ORDER THEM TO ALSO HAVE A PLAN. AND FROM A RECOURSE PERSPECTIVE. IT'S WE LEAVE IT UP TO THEM RIGHT A FIFTY FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THE DECISION THAT WE MADE WAS INACCURATE INAPPROPRIATE TARGETED IN IN SOME WAY IT LED TO A CERTAIN HARM. THEY THEY ALWAYS HAVE A LEGAL RECOURSE THAT THEY CAN PURSUE BUT THAT THAT'S- I JUST DON'T KNOW. WITH ALL RESPECT. TO THE I UNDERSTAND. THE P. GINNY WANTS TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW. THE SAFETY ARGUMENT I'M NOT SAYING THAT P. GINNY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SAFETY AT ALL NOT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT. BUT I ALSO DON'T BUY THE ARGUMENT THE PGA ANY. AS AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE TO ITS- SHAREHOLDERS OF PRESUME AT SOME POINT COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AND HAVE SHARE HOLDERS WITH EQUITY AGAIN. DIED DIED IT'S JUST FOCUS JUST ON THE SAFETY AND IT'S NOT ABOUT A P. GENIES BOTTOM LINE AND AVOIDING. A LIABILITY AND AGAIN POWER SHUTTLES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY I DON'T YOU KNOW THESE THESE WILDFIRES A CATASTROPHIC AND WE CAN AVOID THEM. THAT IS A GOOD THING BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF DRAWING THAT LINE AND THE SCOPE. DOT I HAVE A I AGREE WITH MAYOR OF THE CARTER THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE OF EXACT A SENIOR EXECUTIVE P. GINNY MAKING THAT. A DECISION THAT IS A PUBLIC ROLE IN TERMS OF BALANCING OUT SAFETY AND MY FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR. CENTER STERN I KNOW IS TALKED ABOUT DVRS OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND I COMPLETELY AGREE. WITH WITH HIM IT IS A PART OF THE SOLUTION ON SO MANY LEVELS IN TERMS OF REDUCING OUR NEED FOR MORE AND MORE TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE MORE DECENTRALIZED. APPROACH AND SO THAT DISABILITIES WHETHER IT'S A NURSING HOME OR A BUSINESS OR A OR AN INDIVIDUAL CAN. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON THE POWER ON EVEN IF THERE IS A POWER SHUT DOWN. THROUGH ENERGY STORAGE PGA ANY AT AND OTHER I OR USE HAVE MADE IT VERY VERY HARD AND LINK THE TO GET INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. FORWARD DVRS PARTICULARLY FOR BUSINESSES. WE HAD A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR WITH THE I. O. U.'S FOUGHT TO TRY TO PUT BETTER STANDARDS IN PLACE SO THAT FARMS OR BUSINESSES OR SCHOOLS OR WHATEVER ELSE. CAN GET A QUICK AND EFFICIENT INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT FOR SOLAR FOR ENERGY STORAGE SO THEY CAN TAKE THEIR ENERGY FUTURE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. AND RESPECTFUL TO SEE IF YOU SEE HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL HERE EITHER AND WE NEED MORE DVRS AND SO WILL P. GINNY BE A BETTER ACTOR IN TERMS OF ALLOWING. BUSINESSES AND SCHOOLS INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THOSE DVRS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THESE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR A POWER SHUT DOWN. FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SERVICE ABSOLUTELYSUPPORT THAT I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES ON THE OF THE PROCESSES OF THE INTERCONNECTIONS. OF TAKING THAT DOWN AS A FOLLOW UP FOR US TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THOSE PICKUPS ARE AND HOW WE CAN HELP. US STREAMLINED SOME OF THOSE PROCESS HE'S FINALLY FROM HER CUP. UNDERSTOOD BUT WE WILL IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE SUPPORT. OF D. OURS AND FRANKLY WE'RE ACTUALLY AS PART OF OUR SYSTEM HARDENING AND RESILIENCE EFFORT. INSTEAD OF JUST BUILDING THE GREAT LIKE FOR LIKE RIGHT THAT'S EXISTED FOR. MORE THAN A CENTURY IN SOME CASES FOR LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OF. A HOW DO WE- IMPLEMENT AND LEVERAGE THE D. R. SOLUTIONS LATEST QUIZ TECHNOLOGY WITH THE REMOVAL. CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS IN SOME CASES IN A MICROWAVE. TOP OF A SET. AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING. A ELECTRICAL OVERHEAD LINES ARE UNDERGROUND LINES TO SOME OF THESE URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE IS BECAUSE THAT IS ONE WAY. OF HOW WE MITIGATE RISK IS TO REMOVE THAT. ELECTRICAL LINE OF FROM THE ACTUAL HIGH FALL RISK AREA RISK REMOVAL THE NASA REMOVAL IS THE BEST WAY TO MITIGATE THAT RISK. OKAY I JUST I THINK THAT THE I. R. USE HAVE YOU D. E. OURS IS A THREAT TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND OF WORK TO UNDERMINE THEM. AND I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING FLUX AN ATTITUDE CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. AND I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN A GOOD WAY TO MAKE A COMMENT FIRST AND WE WANT TO GET ON TO THE SECOND PANEL. BUT THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES OF THE BEFORE. I HEARD THREE WORDS. THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD FROM P. JEANNIE BEFORE. THREE WORK AND I'M HAPPY AND EXCITED THAT I HEARD THE- IN THOSE THREE WORDS ARE. I OWN IT. I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT IN THE NINE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO P. JEANNIE I'VE NEVER HEARD THOSE WORDS. AND THAT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE HEARING THEM TODAY. BECAUSE THE THREE WORDS THAT I'M HISTORICALLY HEARD HAVE BEEN DENY DENY DENY. THIS IS THIS IS TO BE AN EXCITING MOMENT BECAUSE WE WE'VE GIVEN. YOU KNOW THEY WERE ALL WILLING TO GIVE SECOND CHANCES TO COMPANIES TO PEOPLE TO ISSUES AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IS THE THIRD CHANCE AND THAT'S THE ONE I THINK P. GENIES LOOKING FOR NOW. AND THEY HAVE TO EARN IT. AND IS CENTER WIENER ASKED THE QUESTION A COUPLE MINUTES AGO. YOU KNOW I GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS EIGHT DAYS IN IN THE LAST NINE YEARS AND YOU KNOW WHY WHY THEY DIDN'T BILL THAT GRID OR WHY THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT IS RESILIENT. BUT WHY THEY DIDN'T DO THE THINGS THAT WERE NECESSARY AND WHAT I SAW. IT BUT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED IS YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A CONVICTED. FELON. WE'RE DEALING WITH A COMPANY THAT DIVERTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM SAFETY FROM MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS TWO BONUSES AND PROFIT ANOTHER THING. WE SAW WHAT I CONSIDERED A CORRUPT COMPANY AND WE SAW CORRUPTS PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AT THE TIME. YEAH I THINK THOSE THINGS HOPEFULLY HAVE CHANGED AT PGA. AND I THINK. THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE OPENING. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT THIRD CHANCE SO I APPRECIATE THOSE THREE WORDS TODAY THANK. WOULD LIKE TO DO IS YOU CAN ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT MISS THOMAS JACOBSON THE OVEN IS THE YOU HAVE THE LETTER THAT YOU HAD SENT TO THE UTILITIES IN. ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIX OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LETTER THAT OUTLINED SOME OF THE ISSUES IN CONDITIONS THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED WITH. HELLO YES AND CAL FIRE IN THE UC WERE CONCERNED WITH OVER. THE D. ENERGIES ATION PROGRAM AT THE TIME AND- THE LETTER S. FOR CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DETAIL. IN FACT HEN I SAW THE LETTER AYE AYE. BACK IN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I LOOKED AT IT AND IT SHOULD MIKE GOT I DON'T HAVE THE UTILITIES CN. CAN DO THIS AND- THEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS INCLUDE WANTED CLARIFICATION DID THEY GET THE CLARIFICATION THAT THEY- SHOULD ASK THEM BUT WAS THE CLARIFICATION PROVIDED TO THE UTILITIES OVER THE- FROM THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT. WE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY SINCE THAT THAT WAS ALMOST A YEAR AGO NOW SO I DO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET CONFIRMATION FROM THEM BUT WE CERTAINLY ENGAGE WITH THEM ON CLARIFYING WHERE WE COULD I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY SENATOR STERN IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION OF OWN ABILITY AND STUFF. IS STILL AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD SAY YES THAT FOR THE MOST PART WE WERE ABLE TO PRY THE CLARIFICATIONS. WE SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME REALLY DIVING INTO THE DETAILS OF IT AS MY- TITLE MENTIONED I'M I'M AN OFFICE PERSON RIGHT I'M AN OPERATIONAL PERSON SO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY HOW DO WE- EXECUTE. ON THESE DIFFERENT ENGAGEMENTS THAT WERE HAVING SO IT GETS DOWN TO THE DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS. HOW DO YOU DEFINE THE POLYGONS WHEN THEY'RE SENDING US THE MAPS WHERE EXACTLY IS THE OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF THE POLY GONE. SO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IS AN ONGOING PROCESS TO GET TO THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY. THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO GET TO. THE GOOD. AND UP ALL THE RESEARCH CENTER I ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY WITH WHAT MISS THOMAS JACOBSON SAID WE HAVE RECEIVED A CLARIFICATION. AS I THINK THE GENESIS OF THAT LETTER WAS BEGAN THAT OCTOBER EVENT. WHERE WE HAD A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED. AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW FRANKLY TRIPPED UP IN TERMS OF. THE EXTERNAL STICKLER COMMUNICATION AND WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT THAT LED TO AND- SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN PRO ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH MISS THOMAS JACOBS AND HER TEAM. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPECTATIONS INCLUDING DEVELOPING A DETAILED FORM. THAT WOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE WARNING CENTER AT THE TIME. THAT WE DO DO THE ACTIVATION AS WELL AS PROVIDING. A PRESCRIPTIVE DETAILED INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE EVENTS SO THAT. THERE'S COMPLETE STRUCTURED THAT'S UNDERSTOOD ON OUR SIDE AND WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT OUR PROCESS SEES. TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE. WE PROVIDE. THE DATA IN AT THE RIGHT QUALITY CONTROL IN PLACE SO THAT. IT A TO THE BEST OF OUR EXTENT POSSIBLE. IS AS ACCURATE AS A AS A CAN BE AN AS TIMELY AS A CANDY. OKAY THAT THE ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I A DAY AFTER WHEN. THIS OCCURRED. AND I SAW THE LETTER AND THEN. IN THIS WAS AFTER THE FIRST PS PS THE P. JEANNIE HAD DUCTED AND THE COMMUNITY OUTRAGE HAT CAME FROM THAT OF AND THEN IS NOVEMBER CAME NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN WE STARTED SEEING THOSE CONDITIONS ARISE P. JEANNIE ANNOUNCED THE ANTICIPATED PS PS. EVENT IN THE LAST MINUTE THEY DIDN'T GO FORWARD WITH THAT. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE EVEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS A PART OF THAT AND THEN WE SAW THE DISASTERS OF FROM THAT AND I GUESS A I IS I WAS LOOKING AT I SAID. YOU KNOW FRANKLY. P. JEANNIE WAS KIND OF IN A BAD SPOT. WERE THEY GOING TO DO. THAT LETTER THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR SO TOUGH THEY WERE NOT PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ABIDE BY THOSE. BEFORE THAT P. S. P. S. S. EVENT WE'RE GOING TO OCCUR. AND SO I THINK EVERY JUST MYSELF AND THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT THAT THEY- THEY TOOK THE CHANCE. THIS TWO OR WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE FROM BY NOT FOR PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT AT THIS POINT. IS WE TOOK A CHANCE AND DIDN'T DIDN'T DE ENERGIZED AND THAT BUT THAT'S JUST MY THINKING ON THAT AND WE SAW THAT THE CATASTROPHE AND DID THAT. THE DISASTER THAT CAME FROM FROM THOSE FIRES OF EIGHTEEN BUT OF. WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS MISTER ARENA IS GO TO THE CALICO I SAW A LITTLE BIT AND COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE% BIT MORE ON. ON HOW YOU DECIDE ON AREAS TO ASK TO POWER DOWN IF THERE'S A- IF THERE IS A LINE OF SUCCESSION OR PRIORITY IN THE EVENT OF AN- EXTREME EVENT OR A PS PS OF INVITE YOU TO IT. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY AND AS I ASKED EARLIER. TO RE DIRECT THAT POWER IN AND. AND OTHER THINGS PRIVATIZATION THAT YOU GO THROUGH IN THAT. SO ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE KNOW ARE NOTIFIED BY THE UTILITY OF A POTENTIAL PSP ASSESSMENT. HOPEFULLY WE GET THAT AND AN EARLY WARNING OF THAT AND WE GET THE DETAILS FROM THE UTILITY AS TO EXACTLY WHAT LINES THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WANT TO GET IT. THEY'RE GOING TO DE ENERGIZED. BASED ON THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A LARGE TEAM OF ENGINEERS. THAT ARE. TIGHTLY CONNECTED TO OUR OPERATIONS CENTER AND THEY DO EXTENSIVE STUDIES. AS TO ONCE THOSE LINES ARE TAKEN OUT WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS TO THIS-PARTICULAR AREA. WHAT OTHER AREAS OF GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION CAN BE UTILIZED TO MITIGATE THAT TYPE OF OUTAGE. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AS A GRID OPERATOR WE EXPERIENCED TRANSMISSION OUTAGES IN GENERATION OUTAGES YOU KNOW AS A AS A NORMAL COURSE OF DUTY RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE EXTENSIVE ABILITY TO STUDY THE SYSTEM. AND DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. PART OF OUR ANALYSIS IS WE HAVE AN OPTIMIZATION ENGINE. THAT CAN FULLY OPTIMIZED TO THE GRID TO THE BEST THAT IT THAT IT CAN IN TERMS OF. OPTIMAL DISPATCH SO ONCE WE GO THROUGH THAT STUDY. WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE UTILITY AS TO WHAT IS POT POSSIBLY RECOMMENDED STEPS MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHERE COORDINATION WITH UTILITY MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN WHAT THEY INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AS A TRENT TRANSMISSION OUTAGE. THERE IS A GOOD THANK YOU. IS THAT I GUESS WHAT THIS PROBABLY GOES TO. THE THREE OF THEM IN TERMS OF THE STANDARDS THE NGUYEN STANDARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY LOOKED AT THE KIND OF THE CRITERIA USED FOR THE PSP AS A VENDOR LIST OF THE CRITERIA THAT THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE WIND THAT I THINK THE GENIE IS TALKING ABOUT IS TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR FORTY FIVE OR SOMETHING IN A IN A- GUSTER SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT. HOWEVER THESE THRESHOLDS SECTION THE MINIMUM WINDS SPEEDS STANDARDS FOR UTILITY POLES AND OTHERS THE GEO NINETY FIVE. RULE THAT QUITE A LOT HIGHER THAN THE FORTY MILES PER HOUR IN THE OTHER UTILITIES DON'T HAVE THAT THAT THRESHOLD SO IS IT TO. HOW DID YOU DEVELOP THAT STANDARD THAT NUMBER ANYWAY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE YOUR TRIGGER POINT. THAT THAT NUMBER WAS INTENDED TO BE A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB JUST IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE AND IT IN MY REMARKS SENATOR I HAD TO MENTION THAT ONE PLACE THAT WE ARE. WE MADE PROGRESS ON IS CORRELATING ARE CIRCUITS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF WINDS. WHICH MEANS AS WINDS PICK UP THERE'S OUTAGES SO WE START TO SEE OUR ON OUR SYSTEM WHETHER THAT'S EQUIPMENT RELATED WHETHER THAT'S VEGETATION COMING IN CONTACT. WITH THE LINES AND WE'VE DONE YOU KNOW THAT ANALYSIS FOR OUR CIRCUS IN THE HIGH FAR RISK AREAS SO WE'RE- LOOKING TO BE MORE IN A STRATEGIC AND TARGETED. IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THAT OF PROBABILITY OF A LOOK LIKE OF OUTAGE PRODUCING WIND BECAUSE IN THIS CASE WERE CORRELATING THE OUTAGE AS A LEADING INDICATOR TO A POTENTIAL FIRE IGNITION A KEEP IN MIND NOT ALL OUTAGES. TURN INTO FAR IGNITIONS AYE SHE VERY FEW OUTAGES. DO BUT THAT'S NOT A BILL THE UNDERLYING KINDA MECHANISM AND MODEL THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH SO THE TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE WAS INTENDED TO BE. JUST MORE OF A DIRECTIONAL A TYPE OF A GUIDELINE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. A AN ABSOLUTE. OKAY THE AND THAT. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SURE YOU'LL YOU'LL BE WORKING ON IN TERMS OF THE NEXT PHASE OF DEVELOPING THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TOOLS AND WHAT. WHAT WHICH STANDARDS THERE SAID IN. AS IT MOVES FORWARD SO YOU CAN MONITOR THAT A LITTLE MORE AND I GUESS WHAT. WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS AT THE END. WHEN THERE IS AN EVENT AND YOU REVIEW THOSE EVENTS THEY HAVE A P. S. P. S. CALLED POWERS OFF THE RE ENGAGE REENERGIZE THEN YOU REVIEW THOSE AFTER THE REPORTS COME IN. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN FROM THOSE AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO GUIDE FUTURE. EITHER REGULATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS AND I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO USE IT SO WE CAN GET THAT METRIC DOWN TO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROLLABLE AND REFINED ENOUGH SO WE CAN AVOID THE PS PS OF INCHES WE HAVE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH I KNOW THIS IS JUST THAT. I'M HOPING A TEMPORARY. THE PS PS OF ENTERED ARE ARE JUST. TEMPORARY THAT WE WILL HAVE A RESILIENT SYSTEM ROBUST SYSTEM AND NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SHARING THE POWER OFF BECAUSE WE KNOW TO WITHSTAND THAT IS THAT WITH THE- END GOAL IS. WELL I AM THE WITH THE- UTILITIES ARE DEVELOPING THEIR HOME HIS PEERS PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW IS A THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE FINANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL INDEX THAT EACH COMPANY IS DEVELOPING FOR THEIR TERRITORY AND NOT INDEXED SEEKS. OUT SEVERAL FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION WIND BEING ONE OF THEM BUT SOME CHRISTIAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY OF INVIOLABILITY OF FUEL. OR OTHER CRITICAL FACTORS THAT THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT THE AS WELL AS HISTORIC CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE. EACH UTILITY IS. DEVELOPING THEIR OWN THAT SEEKING THE FROM FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION AND- THOSE INDEXES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. AND THE WAY THAT THEIR OPERATIONALIZE IN THEIR PROCESS SEES IS THAT IF THE SPECIFIC. IN THE YOU KNOW IF INDEX REACHES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THAT'S WHEN THE UTILITY ACTIVATES INTO THEIR PS PS WATCH. AND TELL THEM YOU KNOW AND THEN WE GO FORWARD FROM THERE SO THE THING COMMUTER THE ONE THE ONE AREA FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE UTILITIES ARE DEVELOPING THESE. L. INDICES AND HOW THE TIE WITH THE STATE'S ASSESSMENTS OF FIRE THREATS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ONE IN THE SAME AND ONE CAN BE USED TO INFORM THE OTHER AND THERE'S INTO DEPENDENCY IS THERE. BUT IN ORDER FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO RECONCILE THE UTILITY FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL INDEXES WITH THE OVER ALL THREAT ASSESSMENT IS THE STATE. SO THAT'S- A THINK IS GOING. TO TAKE SOME TIME AND ILL. YOU KNEW WHAT IT YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL CAN FACTOR HERE IS THAT THE YOU KNOW IT WHEN IT COMES TO WIND IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR POLLS TO WITHSTAND THE CERTAIN WIND FACTOR I MEAN ONE. THE FIRST POINT IS FULL OF THE MOST THE L. ROBUST PIECE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE POOL FAILURES ARE THE- LOWEST. YOU KNOW OUT OF ALL THE STATISTICS OF FIRING CONNECTIONS THAT'S THE BILL ONE OF THE WILL WAS BECAUSE IT IS AND I MEAN IT. DOES LITTLE AT LEAST LIKE A PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO FAIL ELLEN THE CONDUCTOR IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FAILED ON THE POLE. OWN AND YOU KNOW BUT EVEN MORE SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS A VEGETATION FAILURE AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE TOUGH PART YOU KNOW YOU CAN DESIGN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUIT TO WITHSTAND A CERTAIN NGUYEN FACTOR BUT- EL YOU CAN EVEN KEEP INCREASING THE CONDUCT THE STRENGTH. BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU HOME YOU KNOW WITH WINS OVER YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR GUSTS YOU STARTING TO HOLD THE TREES AND VEGETATION FAILING THAT FLIES ON THE WIND UNTIL IT HIT SOMETHING. AND THAT SOMETHING CAN BE A AND ENERGIZED CONDUCTOR SO HELD THE YOU KNOW SO THAT UNITS THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THE WINDOWS IN THE PORN FACTOR HERE IN JUST ABOUT DESIGNING. THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITHSTAND CERTAIN WINS ISN'T QUITE ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO REDUCE. THE RISK DOWN IN THIS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. ALL IN THAT RESPECT BUT GOING BACK TO THE SCHOOL QUESTION. ELTON. WHEN THE UTILITIES DE ENERGIZE IN DOING THE ASSESSMENTS AFTER THE FACT IN THIS ONE ELEMENTS ALL OF YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING HOW THE UTILITIES DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND FACTORS LIKE WIND IN THE FIGHT FOR A POTENTIAL INDEX THAT GO INTO IT WITH THE OTHER ONE IS THE RISK TOLERANCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GOING BACK TO AND ALL THE YOU KNOW WHETHER ALL OF ITS FINANCIAL OR SAFETY YOU KNOW THE EVERY AND CITY HAS A DIFFERENT RISK TOLERANCE I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE NATURE ALL OF PALM WITH RESTORE INCE'S ARE THERE SPECIFIC TO THE AND CITY. OF AN IN EVERYBODY'S RISK ASSESSMENT THIS DIFFERENCE SO UTILITY LAKE AS THE GENIE FOR EXAMPLE CAN SAID THE RISK TOLERANCE TO BE ZERO ZERO IGNITION SO FIRES FROM OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ALL YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE THE RISK TOLERANCE OF THE OTHER UTILITIES THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THAT'S THEIR ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PUBLIC MAYBE THEY'D SEEKING YEAR THE L. THERE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY ISN'T SO COUNTS WITH WHATEVER THAT IS THEY SAID THEY WERE A RISK TOLERANCE. HOURS RISK TOLERANCE MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON. THE STATE AGENCY OR ALL. A SPECIFIC JURISDICTION RATE ELM IN MAYBE IN SOME CASES AS THE STATE'S WE COULD TOLERATE A UTILITY IGNITION OF A FIRE. IF THE DAMAGES BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD NOW HOLLOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT RATE IF WE HOW OF THESE DIFFERENT RISK TOLERANCES IN THE UTILITY BASED ON THAT RISK TOLERANCE IS ONCE. WITH THE AT THE SITES TO THE ENERGIZED THEIR LINES IF THERE'S A RISK OF ANY A CONNECTION. ALL HOW DO WE AS THE REGULATOR THEN THE SIDE WITH THE DOT WAS AN ACCEPTABLE DECISIONS TO MAKE RIGHT NOW ALL KIND OF SITTING. IN THE IN THE I OWN A CHAIR ON THE ON THE RECEIVING SIDE THAN THE REGULATORY ROLE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT. OF WHETHER THEIR DECISION TO THE ENERGIZED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A RISK OF IGNITION AND MAY BE A LOSS OF ONE PROPERTY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE DEVASTATING. YELP WILD FIRE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS TO MAKE IT. SPREAD THROUGH THE ENTIRE TERRITORY WERE THERE BUT THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE RISK OF AN IGNITION IS THAT THE CLIP DOUBLE OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THAT RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT ANSWER EXISTS AND SO SOMETHING WILL NEED TO HOP IN AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE. TO ENGAGE FURTHER IN THAT CONVERSATION IN THE SEAT WITH THE WE ALL. YOU KNOW ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A E. L. HE IS A STATE. COMMUNICATE WHAT THAT RISK TOLERANCE. IS WITH THE PUBLIC WITH RISK TOLERANCES AND THEN HOW TO MANAGE IT WOULD IF WE CAN GET THERE TO AT LEAST. EXPOSE OF WOOD THE RISK TOLERANCES ARE OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR UTILITIES OF THE RISK TOLERANCE IS TRULY KNOWING IGNITIONS A THINK THEY NEED TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO AT LEAST. WE KNOW THAT CRITERIA WITH WHICH THE WORKING. THAT WAS. THAT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO END THIS PANEL DISCUSSION. THERE REALLY WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS THAT'S THE ENTIRE ISSUE RIGHT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND FIND WITH THAT RISK TOLERANCE IS AND WHO HOW. WE AS A COMMUNITY AS A SOCIETY ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION THANKS I KNOW THIS ONE A LOT LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED BUT MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU YOU. WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR PANEL NUMBER TWO SO IF I COULD CALL UP OUR NEXT PANELIST. OF LANCE HASTINGS PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS CREATION IS NICE TO SEE YOU SCOTT. MURDER SHOT SENIOR ADVISER REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION. MELISSA COUSIN IT'S LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY. KERRY KERRY CRAWLEY HEALDSBURG UTILITY DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF HILLSBORO. AS WELL AS ALEXANDER COPE. THE GENERAL MANAGER EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT IS CALLED. A VERY GOOD TO PLEASE COME UP AND AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I THINK FOR ALL OF US IT SO WELL WORTH IT I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH HOPEFULLY ENOUGH ROOM. FOR EVERYONE IT'S A GOOD THING WE GOT MAYOR LICCARDO OUT OF HER EARLIER THAT'S GOOD. WE WOULD HAVE ROOM OR ANYWAY. SO THAT'S WONDERFUL WELL. THANK YOU FOR A THE URGENT WORK YOU'RE DOING IN THE P. S. P. S. SPACE TRYING TO COORDINATE IN EVENT. WALL MINIMIZING ITS IMPACTS OF. THE NEXT DAY YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS CUSTOMERS PERSPECTIVES OF AND THOSE IMPACTED BY THE P. S. P. S. ADVANCE MY HOPE IS THAT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION. AND WAS INTO A COVERED THINGS THAT WEREN'T COVERED IN THAT THE CONSECUTIVE BACKGROUND PAPERS AND THAT'S OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THE LADY. OF THE COMMUNITY AROUND THE PS PS IS SO YOU CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND OUR CUSTOMERS IS B. S. P. AS A VENT BUT IT ALSO PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FORCE US TO BETTER PREPARE FOR DISASTERS GENERALLY. TO REDUCE THAT COMMUNITY RISK WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN AND I APPRECIATE SENATOR STERN. DIRECTION IN HIS PREVIOUS COMMENTS RELATED TO THAT SO IF AN EARTHQUAKE OR A CYBER ATTACK OR ANY OTHER HORRIFIC EVENT OCCURS. IN GREATLY IMPACTS OUR ELECTRICITY GRID OUR COMMUNITIES ARE PREPARED TO WITHSTAND THAT POWER LOST. TO SOME DEGREE. UNDERSTANDABLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH CALIFORNIA BEING IN THE P. S. P. S. REGIME I HOPE TO. DISCUSS EACH OTHER'S CHALLENGES TODAY. BUT I HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON SOME SOLUTIONS THAT THAT WE CAN GET WAYS TO LESSEN THE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS. AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME AND I GUESS WE MAY START WITH THE ORDER THAT. WE HAVE IN THE BEGIN WITH MR HASTINGS WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND FOR THE MEMBERS. I'D APPRECIATE THE UP TO REPRESENT A BUSINESS FOR YOU REGARDING PS PS AND- WE WORK WITH THE COALITION OF AG INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL USERS MANY OF WHICH WERE THE ROMANS ONE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE APPRECIATION FOR BEING ABLE TO. HAVE PERCENT TODAY. THAT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF LAST PAEL WHAT A GREAT WAY TO WRAP THAT UP AND FOCUS INTO OURS BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE BUSINESS END OF THE PS PS. AND I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO SAY. YOU KNOW GOSH WE'RE GONNA LOSE ALL KINDS OF WHICH IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE THAT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. BUT RATHER CREATE A NUDGE TO PUSH UPWARD FOR A SOLUTION AND I THINK IT WAS HIT UPON RIGHT THERE AT THE END. IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY THIS OF VEGETATION ISSUE. THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE. A POWER SHUT DOWN REQUIREMENTS. LET'S ADDRESS THAT. AND LET'S ADDRESS IT WITH ALL VIGOR AND ATTENTION. WE DID POLAR MEMBERS PART OF THE HEARING AND THANKS FOR GIVING US IN ADVANCE. DIRECTIVE TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN. THE PAIN. HAVE A SHUT DOWN. AND ALL THE FEEDBACK WE GOT WAS IN THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. AND THIS IS ACROSS A- WHOLE RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS IS FORTY EIGHT HOURS NOTICE. THAT ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROPERLY SHUT DOWN OUR EQUIPMENT. MANAGE WHAT IS ON THE FLOOR MANAGER EMPLOYEES AND BE PREPARED. AND THEN FOR OUT HOWEVER LONG THE EVENT OCCURS THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT TO POWER BACK UP. SO FOR MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE THE MINIMUM IS FOUR DAYS NOT WITHSTANDING HOWEVER LONG THAT DID THE EVENT MAY OCCUR. IN THE IMPACT OF THAT IN THE COST AND I DO APPRECIATE SENATOR WINTERS COMMENTS EARLIER. IT COMES AT A GREAT COST FROM AN EMPLOYMENT STANDPOINT LOSS OF PRODUCT ANECDOTALLYI CAN SHARE THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYER LOS FORTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF BEER AT A BREWERY IN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE THE POWER WENT OUT. YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD WELL TOO BAD BUT IT'S A PERISHABLE PRODUCT IS A PROCESS THE AND- DID COST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY FOR THAT BREWER. SO HOW WE MANAGE THAT AND I'M JUST USING THESE AS YOU KNOW RATIONALE TO PUSH BACK UP WHERE WE GO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LIABILITY. THAT WE FACE WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT. AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE MANUFACTURER THAT DECIDED TO COME TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE POWER MIGHT BE ON MOST OF THE TIME. AND THEY EXPECT THE POWER TO BE ON ALL OF THE TIME. BARRING A NATURAL CATASTROPHE. AB QUAKERS ARE SOME OF HE MAGNITUDE. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE OUTAGE LET'S REALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORT ENERGY. IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US. THE AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT I GOT FOR YOU IN FACT OUR MEMBERSHIP IS. QUITE DIVERSE. IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A CEMENT MANUFACTURE IN U. VIRTUALLY HAD ALMOST NO NOTICE. TO TURN OFF YOUR FACTORY IN IF YOU HAVE PRODUCT IN. THE PIPES BEING PREPARED YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT YOU LOSE THE EQUIPMENT. THE REFERENCE TO REFINERIES FLARING WAS ALSO MADE EARLIER. IT IT'S HARD IN THE ABSTRACT. FOR I THINK THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY TO GRASP AND MAYBE SOMETIMES. AND THOSE OF US HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT COULD HAPPEN. AND WOULD RATHER THAT THEY NOT SO IF WE GET A WARNING FOR A P. S. P. S. FOR US. YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN. YOU CAN'T RISK LIKE YOU CAN AS A RESIDENT WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THE POWER MAY GO OUT LET'S. LET'S WEATHER THE STORM AND IF IT DOESN'T GO OUT YOU CAN HIGH FIVE YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOUSE WELL WE MADE IT THROUGH. WE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO AVOID TO ALL EXTENT POSSIBLE. ANY SHUT DOWNS IS REALLY UR GOAL OR OBJECTIVE TO BE HERE TODAY. AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION ON WE RECOGNIZE IS GONNA BE AT AN ONGOING DISCUSSION. THE END OF A WRAP pWHO UNITED CONVERSATION EARLIER IN THE WEEK. THAT THIS HEARING. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR. THIS IS A ONE TIME HEARING CLOSE GET THE ISSUES ON THE TABLE. PERHAPS FOCUS ON SOME REALLY. MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE ACTED UPON AS SOON AS THIS LEGISLATURE CAN ACT. SO THE NEXT YEAR IF THERE IS A HEARING YOU TO BE WELL WE DID A GREAT JOB. WE HAVEN'T HAD A SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRE. THE END THE FACT IT WOULD THE PREVIOUS PANEL DID CONCLUDE THE WAY THEY DID IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND I'M I'M NOT HERE TO SAY THAT IT IS. BUT IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM. LET'S WORK WITH UTILITIES AND FIND IF IT'S ONE PARTICULAR VULNERABLE VALLEY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE VULNERABLE VALLEY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LET'S FIX IT. AND THE ISSUE OF HAVING. READY POWER AVAILABLE. IF THE PART IS GONNA GO OUT TO HAVE GENERATION AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE LAWS ALLOWED US TO DO THAT. BECAUSE WE BUILD ALL KINDS OF BACK UP OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT LUXURY IN MOST CASES THE HARMONIZATION OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO DO THAT. IS ALL MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S THE IMPACT IS FAR GREATER TO HAVE A SHUT DOWN FOR US IN OUR CASE A MINIMUM FOUR DAYS. TO KEEP THAT FACILITY RUNNING AND KEEP EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE THAT BACK A GENERATION OF WHATEVER SOURCE. IDEALLY THE LEAST POLLUTING AS POSSIBLE TO KICK IN AND KEEP THE PROCESS GOING. SO IT IS PART OF YOUR SOLUTION PLEASE CONSIDER THOSE THINGS TO GIVE US THE OPTIONS. THE AND I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE OF THE NOTION THAT ON THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL SAYS WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND I LIKE TO DO A LITTLE REFORM THAT TO SAY WITH RELIABLE POWER COMES GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT WOULD GIVE US NOT. THE ABILITY TO GROW BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP. GROW THE ECONOMY AND BE LIKENED. TO CALL OURSELVES THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WHEN WE'RE HAVING A HEARING LIKE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A PARADOX. IT'S HARD FOR US TO SAY THAT. WITH A STRAIGHT FACE OVER TALK ABOUT TURN OFF OF THE POWER SO. GOOD WITH THAT ALL DAHLE PROCEDURE THERE LATELY. STOCK ONE QUESTION IF YOU DO MANY OF YOUR FACILITIES. HAVE COGENERATION OPPORTUNITIES TO THEY HAVE FACILITIES ON SITE AND IF THEY DON'T ARE THOSE. BEING PLANNED NOW I BELIEVE YOU CAN BETTER BE A PLANS NOW BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THE THREAT THAT WE FACE. THE REACTION TO THE BURGER WAS THEY PUT INTO FIVE MEGAWATT GAS FIRED TURBINES IMMEDIATELY. AT TO AVOID THAT PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. BUT THAT'S NOT A PROCESS YOU CAN JUST GO IS BUT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE HOME DEPOT AND BUY ONE. AND PUT IT IN AND GET GOING CITY DOES TAKE A LOT OF PLANNING YEAH WE THINK THERE'S JUST AS MUCH PLAN THAT COULD BE DONE IN MANAGING. THE THREAT ON THE ENDS THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT WOULD BE AN IDEAL SITUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COMMERCIAL. WELCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR EXTENDING THE INVITATION. TO THE CALIFORNIA SO IN STORE DISSOCIATION TO BE HERE AND REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE COMMUNITY. YEAH I WAS A IT REALLY BROUGHT HOME TO ME JUST HOW TRAGIC THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE WHEN MISTER HASTINGS MENTIONED THAT FORTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF BEER LOST MY MIND I IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THAT TO. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PINTS WHICH YOU KNOW REALLY MAKES MORE PALPABLE. NOW I MEAN WE REALLY CAN'T STAND YET HAVE SUFFERED MORE LOSSES LIKE THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE STUDENT RESOURCES CAN HELP. IT IN FACT YOU MENTIONED COMBINED HEAT AND POWER. IN THE STATE IS REALLY BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM COMBINED HEAT AND POWER. IN PART BECAUSE OF OUR DESIRE D. CARBONIZED THE GRID. SO POLICY ACTIONS TAKEN THE PC OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF PHILLY. BEEN GEARED MORE TOWARDS RAMPING DOWN THE AMOUNT OF. RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OVERTIME. THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT THAT WAS PREPARED VIEW. FRAMES. THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FORGET GRID OPERATORS AND FOR THE FOR THE REGULATORS THAT OVERSEE THEM AS A DILEMMA BECAUSE ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE THE CERTAINTY THAT TAKING ACTION. TO INITIATE A POWER SHUT OFF WILL CAUSE SOME HARM AND THAT COULD BE FINANCIAL. IT COULD BE SAFETY RELATED OR EVEN JUST PSYCHOLOGICAL THE- INCONVENIENCE IN THE AGGRAVATION OF HAVING A PARTIAL FOR DAYS AT A TIME. THAT'S IS ONE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU EXECUTE IT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHETHER YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AVOIDED A FIRE AND IF SO WHAT WHAT WOULD THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT FAR HAVE BEEN. SO YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS- ESSENTIALLY. OF ESTIMATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTION VERSES IN ACTION. SO THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF THE COST. OF A- OF A POWER SHUT OFF. THE MORE RELUCTANT UTILITIES WILL BE TO EXECUTE THEM BECAUSE THE BOUNCING BACK COST VERSUS. THEIR THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRE RISK. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POWER SHUT OFF BY MAINTAINING POWER AND THAT COULD BE EITHER FOR TARGETED CUSTOMERS ARE FOR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. PAGES FOUR AND FIVE OF THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT. LIST SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF SOCIETAL COSTS AND SAFETY RELATED RISK THE PARTIAL OFTEN POSE. A SELLER AND STORAGE CONTRACT THE ADDRESS TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF THE SOCIETAL COSTS THE ONE IS THE DESTRUCTION OF POWER TO CRITICAL FACILITIES. AND THE OTHER IS THE RISK THAT POWER SHUT OFF IMPOSES ON CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF HONORABLE CUSTOMERS. OF SEWER AND STORAGE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO RESILIENCY AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE COST A PARTIAL LOSS. UNDER THREE BROAD CONFIGURATIONS SO THE FIRST WOULD BE. THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO DEPLOY IS PROVIDING BACKUP POWER FOR SINGLE FACILITIES ARE RESIDENCES AND RECENT ACTIONS HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PC OF ALREADY SHOWN A STRONG INTEREST IN HELPING FACILITATE THAT. I CAN TALK ABOUT ABOUT THAT'LL IT MORE LATER. THE OTHER TWO CONFIGURATIONS ARE MORE CHALLENGING FINANCIALLY REGULATORY EARLY AND TECHNICALLY. THE SECOND IS THAT. A DISTRIBUTED SOLAR IN STORAGE COULD BE CONFIGURED IN A WAY THAT UTILITIES OR UTILITIES TO AGGREGATORS COULD CALM THOSE RESOURCES TO HELP MAINTAIN RELIABILITY SO THAT NO ONE LOSES POWER THIS IS RELATED TO THE LIKE THE IN MINUS ONE CONTINGENCIES THAT UTILITIES ALREADY REQUIRED TO PREPARE FOR. AND IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T ENTIRELY ISOLATED MAYBE IT HAS TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TRANSITION PATHWAYS SERVING IT. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE. WHERE UTILITY WOULD NORMALLY NEED TO. START INITIATING ROTATING OUTAGES IN ORDER TO BALANCE. THE DEMAND AND THE LOAD POCKET BUT THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY. D. E. OURS COULD BE CALLED ON TO HELP THE UTILITY RIDE THROUGH THOSE HOURS WERE DEMAND MIGHT EXCEED. THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY AND OUR JUST COULD BE AVOIDED. THAT IS CHALLENGING WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN PLACE TO DO THAT. THERE'S A AN ANALOGOUS PROGRAM AT THE CHI SO RUNS THE RELIABILITY DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCE PROGRAM. MY IMPRESSION IS IT'S AN UNDER UTILIZED PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY GRANULAR ENOUGH. BUT IT COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR HOW WE WOULD USE THE OURS IN THIS HI CONFIGURATION. AND THEN THE THIRD IS USING SOLAR STORAGE AND OTHER DVRS. AND A FULLY ISLAND AND MICRO GRIDS OPERATION MODE. AND THERE ARE VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF THAT THAT SPANNED MORE THAN A COUPLE OF FACILITIES AND FOR MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH BREAK A SPRINGS THAT TAKE YEARS IT WAS FUNDED BY. NUMEROUS GRANTS IMMUNITY COMMISSION FROM DO YOU EAT THE UTILITIES AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT. BUT JUST BECAUSE DIFFICULT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NOT WORTH PUTTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORT INTO EVALUATING. WHERE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES ARE THAT MIGHT MOST BENEFIT FROM USING D. R. AS IN THESE WAYS AND THEN AND VIGOROUSLY PURSUING AT LEAST SOME PILOTS TO START. THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND TO DEVELOP THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT. IN THE MEANTIME WE SHOULD STRIVE TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF DVRS FOR THAT FIRST USE CASE SINGLE FACILITY OR SINGLE RESIDENTS BACKUP POWER. WE CAN DO THAT NOW WE CAN DO THAT QUICKLY IN THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. THE COST THE POWER CHAU LOS IMPOSE ON THESE MOBILE CUSTOMERS. AND COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THESE ARE CRITICAL FACILITIES MAINTAIN POWER. THERE'S ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT. SOLAR AND STORAGE IS BEING THE ALL IN SOLUTION AND- THE UTILITIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROMOTING THE USE OF BACKUP GENERATORS. HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS. THE ONE INTERESTING APPOINT KEEP IN MIND. IS THAT EVEN WHERE THESE FOSSIL FUELED BACKUP GENERATORS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OR CUSTOMERS ARE CONSIDERING LIKE. ODD THE- CUSTOMER THE PURCHASE THE TWO FIVE MEGAWATT CASTER BINDS. THE USE OF SOLAR AND STORAGE AND ACTUALLY ENHANCE THE RESILIENCY CAN WORK IN TANDEM WITH OF TRADITIONAL FOSSIL FUEL GENERATOR AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE WAY THAT IT DOES US OBVIOUSLY JUST SOLAR WILL DISPLACE KILOWATT HOURS OTHERWISE PRODUCED BY THE DIESEL OR GAS FOR GENERATOR. BUT WITH THE ARK ADDITION OF STORAGE THAT ENHANCES. THE ABILITY OF THE BACKUP GENERATOR TO OPERATE IN A MORE STEADY STATE MODE BECAUSE DID THE STORAGE CAN ABSORB THE LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND THAT ARE TYPICAL SERVING ONE CUSTOMER THEY'RE NOT SMOOTHED OUT BY HAVING. HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS WE GET SMOOTH TRANSITIONS THEY'RE VERY. JAGGED FOR SPIKES IN DEMAND AND THAT CAUSES A DIESEL GENERATOR TO OPERATE VERY INEFFICIENTLY AND IT STARTS EMITTING A LOT OF PARTICULATES AS IS RAMPING UP QUICKLY TO TRY TO MEET THOSE. I WIDE SWINGS IN DEMAND I KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL NOBLE ENERGY LAB AND OTHERS HAVE. DONE SOME STUDIES AND SHOWN THE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF ADDING STORAGE. AS A HYBRID. BACK UP CLUB POWER SUPPLY. AND SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST I'LL CLOSE HERE AND SAY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SI PC HAVE ALREADY GIVEN TO THE SE OF CLEAN THE OURS TO PROVIDE THIS BACK UP AND RESILIENCY BENEFIT IN ADDITION TO THE MORE CUSTOMARY OF BENEFITS THAT WE THINK OF LIKE GRID VALUE AN ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT INSIGHT INTO THAT AREA THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD DISCUSS WITH. WELCOME AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS. I'M MELISSA CABINETS AND THE LEGAL DIRECTOR WITH THE CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY WHERE I REGULARLY REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I'VE WORKED ON ISSUES REGARDING THE ENERGY STATION SINCE THE FIRST APPLICATION BY SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOLLOWING WHAT WITHIN THE MOST DISASTROUS FIRES IN STATE HISTORY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. I WANT TO START UP A JOINING THE OTHER PANELISTS BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. AND THE COMPLEX ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENERGY STATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK. EVERYONE AGREES THE POWERSHOT OFFICE CREATE RISK OF HARM TO AFFECTED POPULATIONS EVEN AS THEIR INTENT IS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE. BUT THE RISKS ARE NOT SPREAD EVENLY THROUGHOUT THE POPULATION. AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ALREADY VULNERABLE INCLUDING THOSE THAT CONTAIN A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY SOMEONE WHO SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC ILLNESS OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ACCESS TO FUNCTIONAL NEED ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF HARM. PARTICULARLY DURING AN EXTENDED POWER SHUT OFF. THIS IS BEEN GENERALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE EXTREMELY HELPFUL BACKGROUND PAPER. BUT I WANT TO ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE A CONSTITUENCIES WERE MOST AT RISK. AND HOPEFULLY DISCUSS SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. TO THE WHITE PAPER SPECIFICALLY NOTES THAT HOUSEHOLD CONTAINING A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY ARE AT RISK. BUT IT IS DOESN'T GIVE SPECIFICS OF WHO THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION EARLIER OF MEDICAL BASELINE. BUT THAT'S ONLY A TINY SLIVER OF THE POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY AT RISK OF HARM DURING AN EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE. GREATER EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES AT RISK. MOST OBVIOUSLY ARE PEOPLE WHO RELY ON RESPIRATORS OR OTHER DEVICES TO BRIEF. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE AT RISK OF DEATH WITHOUT ONGOING ACCESS TO A CONSISTENT ENERGY SUPPLY AND THEY SIMPLY MUST HAVE POWER FOR THE DURATION. BEYOND THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO RELY ON AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY OF MEDICAL DEVICES POWERED BY ELECTRICITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH. THESE CAN INCLUDE INSULIN PUMPS AND GLUCOSE MONITORS. NEBULIZERS C. PAP MACHINES. AN EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS WHICH INCLUDE WIRED AS WELL AS WIRELESS COMPONENTS AND ALSO DEPEND ON RELIABLE FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK. THE HEALTH RISKS TO THESE POPULATIONS DURING AN EXTENDED OUTAGE MAY BE LESS DRAMATIC THAN LOSS OF RESPIRATOR ASSISTANCE BUT THEY'RE NO LESS REAL. AND THEY MAY BE NO LESS SEVERE. THEN THERE ARE POPULATIONS WHO RELY ON MEDICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE REFRIGERATED INCLUDING INSULIN. IN ADDITION TO THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH RISKS TO THESE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROPERLY STORE THEIR MEDICATION. AN EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BURDENS AS PEOPLE HAVE TO REPLACE THE LOST MEDICATIONS POTENTIALLY OUT OF POCKET. THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO USE MOBILITY DEVICES POWERED BY ELECTRICITY. THEY MAY NOT BE AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF HARM WHEN A POWER OUTAGE TAKES PLACE BUT IF THERE'S ANOTHER EMERGENCY OF A FIRE ACTUALLY BREAKS OUT IN AN EVACUATION IS ORDERED. THEIR ABILITY TO EVACUATE MOVE TO SAY FIFTY IS LIKELY TO BE EXTREMELY COMPROMISED. THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TOLERATE EXTREME TEMPERATURES. THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE MAY FACE X. THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH RISKS OF OR ELSE THEY MAY BE FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES BECAUSE BY DEFINITION OF P. SPS ADVANTAGE IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE DURING THAT SANTA ANA CONDITION OR TIME OF HIGH WINDED HIGH FIRE THREAT. WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE HIGH. THEY MAY FACE IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH RISKS SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BURDENS. AS THEY UP ARE FORCED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO GET THEMSELVES TO A LOCATION OF SAFETY. AND STAY THERE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BROADER COMMUNITY. IDENTIFIERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE AT RISK. THE WHITE PAPER ALSO IDENTIFY SOME SOCIAL COSTS OF THE ENERGY STATION. BUT IT LEAVES OUT MANY FORESEEABLE COSTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT A. F. AND WHICH IS ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS. FOR EXAMPLE THE WHITE PAPER DOES KNOW THE POTENTIAL FOR HAMPERED IT BACK YOU ASIANS. BUT IT LEAVES OUT IMPORTANT BARRIERS THAT MAY BE WIDESPREAD. INCLUDING RISKS TO PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANUALLY OPEN THEIR GARAGE DOOR IN ORDER TO GET THEIR CAR OUT OF THEIR RESIDENTS. PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR HOMES IF THE ELEVATORS AREN'T FUNCTIONING DUE TO A LACK OF POWER. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT FOR MOBILITY ON DEVICES SUCH AS POWER WHEELCHAIR SCOOTERS THAT MAY LOSE ACCESS TO CHARGING. THE WHITE PAPER OF KNOWLEDGE IS ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO BUSINESSES. BUT IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO INDIVIDUALS. WHICH CAN INCLUDE LOSS OF FOOD AND MEDICINE WHEN FEDERATION IS DISRUPTED. LOST EARNINGS WITH A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT IS CLOSED AN OUT OF POCKET SAFETY IN ORDER. I'M SORRY OUT OF POCKET SPENDING IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES. MAY FACE MORE LOSSES THAN AVERAGE AND ALSO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO BE LOW INCOME AND NOT WELL POSITIONED TO ABSORB OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND THEN FINALLY THE WHITE PAPER NOTES THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED FIRE RISKS DO PEOPLE WHO USE GENERATORS DURING THE TIME OF AN EXTENDED OUTAGE. BUT IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY OTHER FIRE TRIGGERS SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO MAY USE CANDLES OR OTHER FLAME BASED SOURCES OF LIGHT IF THE POWERS ARE OUT. BACKYARD GRILLS RATHER FLAYED BASED SOURCES OF COOKING IF THEIR KITCHEN EQUIPMENT DOESN'T WORK. AND OTHER FIRE TRIGGERS THAT MAY COME. ACTUALLY INCREASE THE RISK OF FIRE WHEN THE GREATEST DOWN. SO AFTER EXPANDING SUBSTANTIALLY THE LIST OF RISKS I DO WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT POLICYMAKERS CAN CONSIDER. OPTIONS CAN INCLUDE PROVIDING ADEQUATE BACKUP POWER TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY FOR THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK. THIS COULD BE GENERATORS. STORAGE OPTIONS OR OTHER METHODS ON BUT FOR ANY OF THESE TO WORK FOR A HALF AN HOUSEHOLDS IN THE POLICY MAKERS WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE COST OF THESE SOLUTIONS PRIORITIZE NEED AND THE ABOUT PRAGMATIC ISSUES OF INSTALLATION AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO THEY WILL. MOST BENEFIT. THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ADVANCE PLANNING BY UTILITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL. TO ENSURE ONGOING ACCESS TO MEDICATION AND OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE AT RISK. THIS IS PARTICULARLY VITAL FOR PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE CARE. BECAUSE THEIR PERSONAL ASSISTANTS ARE LIKELY TO ALSO BE CAUGHT UP IN AN EXTENDED OUTAGE LOSE ACCESS TRANSPORTATION POTENTIALLY. OR ABILITY TO CALM AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE PEOPLE THEY NORMALLY. WORK WITH. RELOCATION ASSISTANCE REYES HOUSEHOLDS. TO APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF A DE ENERGIZED DE ENERGIZED ZONE OR ELSE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPLIED EMERGENCY SHELTERS. AND ALL OF THIS DEPENDS ON EFFECTIVE PLANNING A UTILITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ON HOW TO BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSES DURING AN EXTENDED OUTAGE ON THIS MAY REQUIRE WORK AS WAS TOUCHED ON IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. TO ALLOW FOR GREATER EASE OF A INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UTILITIES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE SERVICES. AND THEN FINALLY AFTER AN EVENT IS OVER POLICY MAKERS NEED TO CONSIDER FOR UP THE OPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL REIMBURSEMENTS. A FOR LOSSES SUFFERED BY PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE THE EXTENDED OUTAGE. THIS IS JUST AN OVERVIEW OF ITEMS THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO THE NEEDS OF F. AND HOUSEHOLDS IMPACTED BY POWER SHUT OFFS I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO BRING THESE IDEAS TO FRUITION AND HELP PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK DURING AN EXTENDED OUTAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS IT SAYS THAT THE- HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ONE OF THE IF YOU KNOW SOME UTILITIES HAVE DISCUSSED THE AND PROPOSED TO TRANSPORT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO COOLING CENTERS OR TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY CAN. CONSISTING THEMSELVES WITH SOME POWER HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT ISSUE. I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE A VERY USEFUL COMPONENT OF PREPARATION TO DATE I AM NOT AWARE OF FULLY. STOCK AND PREPARED FULL ON EMERGENCY SHELTERS BEING PROVIDED IT'S MORE BEEN ON THE ORDER OF DROP IN CENTERS SO I AM NOT AWARE OF SHELTERS THAT ARE PREPARED TO HOUSE PEOPLE FOR SEVERAL DAY PERIOD I AM NOT AWARE OF PREPARATIONS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NEED A LA WITH THE TRANSPORTATION BACK WITH THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION BY SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE UTILITY SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE TRANSPORTING PEOPLE TO HOSPITALS. ON END WHEN FURTHER INQUIRY ASKED AND WILL YOU. GUARANTEE THAT PATIENTS THAT THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY AND IF THEIR DEVICES WERE FUNCTIONING WOOD FROM AND HEALTHY WILL ACTUALLY BE ADMITTED. TO THE HOSPITAL'S THEY COULDN'T SAY AND WHEN ASKED AND WE COVER THE HOSPITAL BILLS THAT THESE PEOPLE PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE. OF THERE WAS NO ENTHUSIASM FOR THE- AND WHEN ASKED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A FURTHER EMERGENCY. BENT AT HOSPITAL BEDS WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY AND- HOW WOULD. THREE ARCHING HAPPEN THERE WAS NO THOUGHT. YET IN PLACE FOR THAT SO FULLY STOCKED EMERGENCY SHELTERS I DID IDENTIFY AS A POTENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE SOLUTION BUT A DROP IN CENTER WHERE YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR CELL PHONE AND SAID IN THEIR CONDITIONING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO. ON ISN'T SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF HONORABLE PEOPLE THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY AND ESPECIALLY YOUR THE CONTEXT YOU CAN PROVIDE BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AFTER RISKY GENIES EXPERIENCES IN THEIR DIRECTION THAT WAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF I MAY JUST ADD ON THAT THE INITIAL CPC DECISION AND FOLLOW UP DECISION. BUT THE SAN DIEGO APPLICATIONS DID TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR MITIGATION IN THE EVENT OF A WHAT'S NOW BEING REFERRED TO AS PS PS EVENTS. AND. MY PAST ORGANIZATION WAS THE ONE THAT FILED THAT APPLICATION AND PURSUED THAT SO I'M VERY. KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT IT BUT I AM. DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN LESS DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT FACT MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS REALLY MEANS. AT THE CPUC AND I BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND SO. THAT NEED FOR MITIGATION. REALLY IS. THE UNIVERSE THAT WERE OPERATING IN NOW ON AND I'M SORRY THAT WERE STILL AT SUCH A PRELIMINARY STAGE WHEN THE DECISION WAS MADE QUITE SOMETIME AGO TO SAY MITIGATION IS NEEDED. AND THEN. NOT ACTUALLY FURTHER DEVELOPED AS TO WHAT THAT MEANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CRAWLEY WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS MEETING AND INVITING US TO SPEAK ON OUR ISSUES SO I AM THE YOU TO DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY HILLS BERG HILLS WERE PROVIDES ELECTRIC WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES SO IN DOING THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE OUR OWN ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BUT WE ARE A TRANSMISSION DEPENDENT ON PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE RELY ON P. GINNY'S TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TO PROVIDE ALL THE POWER AND ENERGY NEEDS. TO THE CITY SO IN P. GINNY STARTS TO TALK ABOUT TRANSMISSION LEVEL OUR SAFETY SHUT DOWNS WE GET REALLY CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THE CITY WIDE BLACKOUT SO LITERALLY ALL OF OUR CITY FUNCTIONALITY IS AFFECTED SO PLEASE FIRE DISTRICT HOSPITALS OUR ABILITY PROVIDE WATER SERVICE ABILITY PROVIDE WASTEWATER COLLECTION TREATMENT NOT YOU KNOW NOT TO MENTION JUST ELECTRICITY IN GENERAL ARE ALL AFFECTED BY TRANSITION LEVEL OUTAGE TO BECOME VERY CRITICAL FOR US IN PREPARING OUR COMMUNITY FOR THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT WE HAVE. EARLY COMMUNICATION WITH P. GINNY AND GINNY IS AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT TRANSITION LIKE IT SHUT DOWN TO OUR CITY HISTORICALLY. GINNY'S LOOKED AT. VERSION CONNECTED PUBLICLY ONLY TILL IT IS A SINGLE METER AND THEREFORE SINGLE CUSTOMER. REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF AWARENESS OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS THAT SERVED BY THAT SINGLE METER IN SINGLE CONNECTION TO THEIR SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WE HAVE IN THIS IS HOW DO THEY ASSESS THIS RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN THE TRANSMISSION VERSES LOSING POWER TO A COMMUNITY OF TWELVE THOUSAND. AND SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEM AND TRY TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION. AND TRY TO HELP PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR TO US. HOW P. GENIE IS PRIORITIZING THOSE TRANSMISSION SHUT DOWNS AND THE ULTIMATE THE FACT OF LOSING POWER FOR. COULD BE FOUR DAYS INTO A CITY SO THAT THOSE ARE BIG ISSUES FOR US AND AGAIN THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO FACT NOT JUST ELECTRIC UTILITY PROVIDING ITS SERVICES IT'S GONNA AFFECT THE CITY'S ABILITY PROVIDE POLICE AND FIRE SERVICES DURING THOSE PERIODS TIME WITH YOUR COULD BE CRITICALLY NEEDED. IT'S GOOD AFFECTING THE CITY'S ABILITY PROVIDE DRINKING WATER AND WATER FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION AS WELL ITS ABILITY TO FRIED YOU KNOW COLLECTION SYSTEM FOR WASTE WATER IN TREATING THAT WASTE WATER THOSE THINGS DON'T STOP JUST BECAUSE THE POWER WENT OUT SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS WE GOT I. CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED WITH THIS TRANSITION LEVEL OUTAGES. SO GOING BACK TO TIMING WE NEED EARLY NOTICE WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS THE DISCUSSION GOES IN AS THE P. GINNY OR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES REACH OUT TO COLORADO AND LET THEM KNOW THAT HEY THESE ARE POTENTIALLY TRANSITION LINES ARE GONNA BE OUT OF SCOPE OR IN A SCHOOL FOR pAT THAT POINT IN TIME WE NEED TO KNOW AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE CAN START REACHING OUT TO OUR STAFF THEY ARE STOP NO HEY THERE'S A POTENTIAL ISSUE THAT'S GOING ON WE NEED TO MOBILIZE OUR GENERATION FOR A BACKUP SUPPLY TO OUR WATER WASTEWATER FACILITIES. WE NEED TO LET POLICE AND FIRE KNOW THAT HEY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO START SHOPPING UP FOR AT LEAST KNOWING WHAT RESOURCES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU. AND IN WITH THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN WAIT FOR THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD SO WE NEED THAT EARLY NOTICE AND EVEN IF IT'S WRONG EVEN IF THE INFORMATION IS PARTIAL OR POTENTIALLY INCORRECT IN THE ULTIMATELY DON'T CALL FOR THAT SHUT DOWN IN THE SCOPE THAT THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS. IT'S BETTER FOR US TO HAVE THAT EARLY WARNING. TO PREPARE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLEAR REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE MESS ROOM UTILITIES THAT THEY WORK WITH THE PUBLIC. UTILITIES AT OUR TRANSMISSION DEPENDENT. TO PROVIDE THAT EARLY COMMUNICATION AND WARNING FOR THESE. AGAIN AS WE GO INTO A SHUT DOWN. WE NEED CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEASURE ON UTILITIES AND WILL YOU PREFERRED TO BE IN THOSE ROOMS WHEN THEM WHILE THEY'RE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. SO WE CAN HAVE CONSTANT UPDATES OF WANT THE ESTIMATED TIME RESTORATION. WHAT IS OUR PROCESS WHAT ARE THEY SEEING ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR SSTEM. ARE THEY STARTING THEIR INSPECTION SO THAT WE COULD ALSO START INSPECTION OF OUR SYSTEM TO RE ENERGIZE OUR SYSTEM. BUT THAT CONSECUENCIAS IN FROM THE INITIAL THOUGHT OF HEY THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ALL THE WAY THROUGH RESTORATION IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLEAR MECHANISM. THAT REQUIRES THAT. THE GATE AND THEN THE OTHER THING OF HARD HIT ON IS. THIS NEEDS TO BE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION. THE UNCERTAINTY OF SHUTDOWNS TRYING TO RUN A CITY TRYING TO RUN BUSINESSES TRYING TO JUST LIVE YOUR NORMAL LIFE. THIS NEEDS TO BE A SHORT TERM THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING CALIFORNIA THIS IS A GREAT STATE. THERE'S A LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE HERE. THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION AT ALL AND SO WE NEED TO FIND WAYS THAT YOU KNOW. IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE KEY ISSUES AND REALLY DRIVE AFTER THOSE SOLUTIONS. SALUTE THIS BECOME SOMETHING THAT'S IN OUR PAST AND WE'VE LEARNED FROM IT BUT WE'VE MOVED ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE RELIABLE. SO WHATEVER THAT TAKES YOU KNOW PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES ARE CERTAINLY WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT EFFORT. BUT THOSE ARE THE KEY POINTS THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO DRIVE HOME WITH TO THE CHAIR AND THE SENATORS OF THAT'S GREAT DID THREE TO HEAR THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK pTHEME IS THIS IS A TEMPORARY. SOLUTION TO A BUT HOPEFULLY TEMPORARY PROBLEM OF A SYSTEM THAT. IS NOT GOING TO WITHSTAND CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND HAS TO BE DE ENERGIZED TO THAT AND AGAIN. COMMUNICATION EARLY COMMUNICATIONS LETTING US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON REALLY MAKING THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS ON WHEN YOU'RE SHUTTING DOWN TRANSMISSION WHAT DOES THAT REALLY AFFECTING AND SO HAVING THE BEST FROM YOU TILL YOU HAVE THAT AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. IF I SHUT OFF THIS ONE CUSTOMER TO FAX A COMMUNITY OF TWELVE THOUSAND. THE TO THE MAJOR THEME AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT STRUGGLING WITH WHAT. WELCOME THANK YOU ARE PROJECTS ARE PRETENDING TO BE HERE. CARE HEALTH AND THAT THIS IS A- AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. ALSO APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY TO BACK AT BATS CLEANUP NORMALLY I'D WORRY ABOUT MAKING AN AFTER LUNCH PRESENTATION BUT IT LOOKS OUR CRICKET MATCHES TO. A BEFORE LUNCH CHEF. BUT BELATED LUNCH PRESENTATION SERVICES THROUGH I HAVE FIVE TWO RECURRING THEMES THAT LIKE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE TODAY ONE IS THE SAME AS MISTER CRAWLEY AND OTHERS. HAVE SAID IN THAT IN THIS TIME. PUBLIC SAFETY PARTIAL SCENARIO COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YOU CAN'T OVER DO IT. AND THE SECOND IS THAT WE HOPE THAT TED THIS THAT FIRE SEASON WILL PROVIDE US A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED. IN THE TO BE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THOSE. AND ADJUST THE APPROACH IS GOING FORWARD. SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HE'S VERY MUCH NOW WE ARE A MAJOR PUBLIC UTILITY N CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE WATER SERVICES TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. AND WASTE WATER SERVICES TO SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FACILITIES TO DO THAT WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT ARE IN THE SERVICE AREA AND IN THE COUNTIES ALTHOUGH WE LEADING UP TO OUR WATERSHED. N. DAB A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF IMPACTING US BECAUSE OUR SERVICE AREA GREAT PORTIONS OF IT. AND A WATERSHED ARE AT ELEVATION AND THEY ARE IN EXTREME FIRE THREAT AREAS. AND SO WHEN WE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS AS SOON AS WE HEARD ABOUT IT I THINK OUR FIRST LETTER COMMUNICATING OUR INTEREST IN BEING A PART OF THE PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT MEANS WAS IN JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS SOON AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT EVER SINCE THEN. FOR US IT'S VERY REAL A DISTRIBUTION LEVEL EVENT L. DISTRIBUTION LEVEL ELECTRICAL OUTAGE HI HAS THE POSSIBILITY IS REFERRED TO LAST FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS AND IT% HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT WE- LEARNED UP UNTIL LAST WEEK. UP TO TWO HUNDRED OF OUR FACILITIES AT HALF OF ALL THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE AND THEN LAST WEEK WE HEARD THAT MAYBE THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL FORTY THAT MIGHTBE IMPACTED BRINGING THE TOTAL TO FORTY. I JUST THE SEQUENCE OF CONVERSATIONS WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE ANXIOUSLY AS ME TO SHARE THAT IN OF THE YEAR THE ACCURACY. OF THOSE ESTIMATES OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE IMPACTED. ARE AT VERY IMPORTANT ADAM AN OVER ESTIMATE WHICH MIGHT BE EASY TO PROVIDE CAUSES US AND OTHERS TO EXPEND CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TRYING TO BE PREPARED FOR SOMETHING HUGE. CONVERSELY IN UNDERESTIMATING WHICH WE DON'T THINK SAID REALLY HAPPENED SO AT THIS POINT. WOULD ALLOW WOULD HAVE IS BEING INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED SO. BACK TO YOU KNOW WE'RE AT A CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDER HAS TO FIND OUT BY THAT. THE THAT THE P. S. P. S. REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING PREPAREDNESS FOR PREPARE FOR OTHER EMERGENCIES DISASTERS. OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND SO WE VIEW THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY DESERVE TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION ALL THE POSSIBLE COORDINATION EVEN IF IT REQUIRES PGA ADDING EXTRA VALUABLE AND A GOOD INVESTMENT. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO PREPARE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE UTILITY. FIVE WE'VE BEEN USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION TO TRY TO BE SURGICALLY FIVE I HAVE POSITION GENERATORS AND RESOURCES TO BE AVAILABLE BUT ALSO TRYING TO WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF RESPONSE TIME THAT WE HAVE RIGHT WE TALK ABOUT SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AT POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUT THE REALITIES IT COULD BE A WHOLE LOT LESS THE WEATHER CHANGES QUICKLY AND WE COULD JUST HAVE EIGHT HOURS OR LESS TO PREPARE BUT WE WANT THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS TO BE VERY CLEAR SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ANY ALL THE TIME WE GET TO MOBILIZE AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS PROVIDING SAFE AND RELIABLE WATER SERVICE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER IS AVAILABLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND FOR FIREFIGHTERS. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THROUGH OUR ACTIONS THAT WE AVOID A D. PRESSURIZATION INCIDENT RIGHT WE BASICALLY SUCKING SYSTEM DRIER PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEM DRY. BECAUSE THAT CREATES PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AND THAT ALSO MAKES IT HARD TO FIGHT FIRES. SO WE HAVE STAFF IN EXPANDING CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED POWER OUTAGES BEFORE RIGHT THESE HAPPEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED THEM. BUT THE PARADIGM WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS WELL THERE'S A POWER OUTAGE IN OUR ELECT FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS WORK IN A S. A. P. TO TRY TO BRING THAT SAYS. THOSE SAID ISOLATED SYSTEMS BACK ONLINE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE AREAS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED. AND SO WE WANT THEM WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE- WE HAD THIRTY THREE PORTABLE PUMPS AND GENERATORS HE'S OUR DIESEL SYSTEMS AND ALSO A NUMBER OF CRITICAL FACILITIES REATMENT PLANTS AND SUCH HAVE. A HARD STAND BY BY SYSTEMS. AND WE'VE ADDED TO THAT WOULD PRETTY MUCH DOUBLED IT BY LEASING EQUIPMENT THAT GOT IN EARLY BOARD APPROVED A- AN ADDITIONAL ON NEAR THIRTY FIVE GENERATORS. SO IMMOBILIZE THAT THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM BOB WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PUMPING PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE SERVICE AREA. AND WE ARE. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN THOSE THINGS ON AND WE'VE GOT CONTRACTS FOR FUEL TENDERS TO MOVE AROUND FEEL AROUND IF THINGS ARE GONNA LAST MORE THAN. A COUPLE OF DAYS OUTAGE. AB BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE IMPACTS FROM THAT LINKS BACK TO SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS. AB THESE ARE ALL DIESEL GENERATORS. AB AND THEY'LL BE RELEASING AIR EMISSIONS. I THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH A EAST BAY MUCH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OBJECTIVES ARE CLIMATE CHANGE MONITORING ESPONSE PLANS IS NOT. THIS WAS IN PART OF THE PLAN TO GO TO DISTRIBUTED STAND BY SYSTEMS LIKE THIS. AND SO WILL BE WORKING TO TRY TO IDENTIFY CLEANER APPROACHES FOR THE FUTURE. WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT THIS WILL BE OVER THIS YEAR AND PROBABLY PERPETUATE INTO NEXT YEAR. BUT THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE FOR US IN THE TIME THAT WE HAD A WAR OF THE SIZE OR HORSEPOWER DEPENDABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY DIESEL CAN RUN FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS BUT THE BATTERIES. AND IS SOLAR IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A PORTABLE MODE. SO MAYBE THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE STATE AND THAT WAS EARLIER SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THAT MIGHT. BE APPROACH TO LOOK AT NEW CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE AND ALSO HOPEFULLY TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN MAKE SEGUE OUT PUBLIC SECTOR POWERSHOT OFFICE IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU PROBABLY INVITED ME HERE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED WITH THE MEDIA IN OUR COMMUNITY EXTENSIVELY IN OUR FAIR NUMBER OF ARTICLES IN THE PAPER. AND ON THE RADIO ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HE BAY AREA. NOW WE HAVE I HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF HIS. ARM WHAT IT MEANS TO WATER SERVICE WHAT IT MEANS THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING TO BE PREPARED WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. AND THERE WAS A RATHER CONVERSATION ABOUT BEING PREPARED FOR EMERGENCY IN GENERAL HAVING BACK UP WATER SUPPLY FOOD AND A AND A WAY TO COOK IT. NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT REACHING IS TO GO BEYOND THAT AND HELP OUR CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO CONSIDER. WE WANNA MINIMIZE OUTDOOR IRRIGATION TRY TO. HELP PRESERVE WHAT WE HAVE IN THE TANKS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM SUFFICIENTLY CHARGE TO AVOID IT PRESSURIZATION INCIDENT. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS SOME CREDIT TO PGA ANY. OB THEY PROBABLY VIEW US AS HAVING HARASSED THE HELL OUT OF HIM OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT WE NEED TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED AND HE- HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE. IF THERE WAS ONE THING WE COULD ASK FURTHER IS THAT TAB IT WILL. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLEAR CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION AND THEY PROVIDED US NUMBERS AND ASSURED US THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL BE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. AM WE HEAR WHEN THE EMERGENCY ACTUALLY HITS AND THAT IS PUBLIC SAFETY SHOWER SHUT OFF AND- YOU HAVE LARGE PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREA OUT OF POWER POTENTIALLY. IN OUR DESIRE IS TO. AT B. EVEN FURTHER EMBEDDED IN THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WITH P. JEANNIE. HAVING A PHONE NUMBER. IS HELPFUL BUT NOT AS REASSURING AS HAVING OUR OWN PRESENCE THERE TO BE ABLE TO RELATE BACK TO OUR STAFF. M. AND FINALLY WERE DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE PS PS MEDICATION PLAN. AND YOU KNOW DRAWING ON ALL THIS RETURN REAL TIME INFORMATION ONE OF THE YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO RESPOND SO WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME EIGHT. MAYBE SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO BEGIN TURNING THINGS OFF BUT WE ALSO NEED A PLAN FOR HOW ARE WE GONNA TURN THINGS BACK ON AGAIN IT WAS A REFERENCE TO TAKE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS TO BRING SAYS SYSTEMS BACK ONLINE. BUT WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PUMPING PLANTS. AND A THERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH PGA ANY TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE WHAT WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO BRING ON AND WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE THERE TO. TO BRING ON THOSE PLANTS IT'S NOT JUST FLIPPING A SWITCH THERE'S A LOT TO IT. THERE ARE CERTAIN LARGER SYSTEMS WE WANT TO BRING ON FIRST. SO THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT OF MITIGATION PLANNING COORDINATION WITH PGA ANY WE HOPE WE CAN FURTHER REFINE THIS. BUT WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA LIVE IT AND. AT BE PUTTING THOSE EXPERIENCES INTO THE PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR. SO IN CLOSING AND WE VIEW THAT THIS FIRE SEASON IS A TRANSITION PERIOD. FOR HIS PAY MODE AND OTHERS. THAT THERE WILL BE LESSONS LEARNED. AND THAT TIME WE NEED TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE. AND WE ALSO HOPE THAT AS OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THEY'LL BE ALTERNATIVES CONSIDER TO THIS P. S. P. S. APPROACH BECAUSE FAIRLY. DISRUPTIVE AND WE VALUE THE ROLE THAT YOU'VE PLAYED AM I SUGGEST THAT HAVE YOU WOULD CONSIDER HAVING ANOTHER HEARING NEXT YEAR TO DISCUSS THOSE LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE- WE KNOW STUFF GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE REALLY OUGHT TO BE SHARING IT AND FIGURING OUT A PATH FORWARD BASED ON THOSE EXPERIENCES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER CRAWLEY ON IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT NOTIFYING YOUR CUSTOMERS TODAY. WHEN THERE'S A P. OR IF THERE IS A HIS BIGGEST EVENT WITH RAPTUROUS. OCCURS JOINT MEDICAL FIRST I COULD CONNECT SO FOR US SMALL CITY INTO THE SIX THOUSAND CUSTOMERS SO IT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW TWO PHONE NUMBERS IN OUR BILLING SYSTEM INTO POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE TO CALL TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND SO WE HAVE A- YOU KNOW ITS- A VENDOR THAT PROVIDE THAT SERVICE. STOCK QUICK BUT WE WOULD ALSO USE AND BECAUSE A SMALL CITY OF GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OUR POLICE AND FIRE. UNIX ALERTS SOCIAL MEDIA. AS MUCH INFORMATION RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WE CAN GET TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF THE SITUATION BUT WERE PREPARED. THROUGH A VENDOR TO MAKE THESE REVERSE PHONE CALLS TO EACH OF THE PHONE NUMBERS ARE BILLING SYSTEM AND WE'VE MADE A YOU KNOW AN OUTREACH EFFORT TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO. UPDATE THOSE THE PHONE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION BUT- THAT'S ONLY ONE MEANS SOCIAL MEDIA IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BIG PIECE OF THAT. BUT AGAIN. EARLY UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVENTS GOING TO HAPPEN OR MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN HELPS US GIVE SOME. EARLY WARNING TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF HEY. YOU WANT TO PROBABLY GET. WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YET OR NOT BUT. BE PREPARED. THE WEATHER'S CHANGING SO THANK YOU. YEAH IT FOR US WE'VE BEEN OUT REACHING AT ALREADY TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE USE THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEXT DOOR HAS ONE COMMUNICATION VEHICLE WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA THAT WE EMPLOY WE HAVE OUR WEBSITE AS A GO TO PLACE. NOW WHEN PEOPLE IF THEY ARE EXPERIENCING ANY OUTAGES THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD GO TO. OUR GOAL AT IT AS THE WATER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO AVOID THE OUTAGES. AND TO COMMUNICATE MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSERVE SO WE CAN PRESERVE. AND WE TOP UP EVERYTHING. WHEN WE GET A RED FLAG WARNING FILLABLE THE TANKS MOBILIZE THE GENERATORS. AND FUEL CONTRACTS OUR HOPE IS THAT WILL BE IN A POSITION WE'RE GOING TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN WATER. BUT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE ISOLATED AREAS WHERE. THINGS ARE HEADED TOWARDS D. PRESSURIZATION FOR REASONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. THEN WE HAVE MORE SURGICAL APPROACHES TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IMPACTED SO. WE STAY BROAD WILL EMPLOY ALL OF OUR PRACTICES TO KEEP THE SYSTEM PRESSURIZED IN IN WATER. AND IF IT DOES TURN OUT THAT THIS GOES ON FOR TOO LONG AND WE SOMEHOW HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. THEN WILL TARGET THAT COMMUNITY AT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. VERY GOOD. JEFF QUESTION SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIKE DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP HEARING HOPEFULLY ONE TABLE WHO WILL NEED ONE IS MISTER HASTINGS WAS TALKING YEAH I HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE TILL NEXT YEAR TO FIGURE SOME OF THIS OUT AND UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER HASTINGS. IF YOU'RE ONE VALLEY OR ONE CANYON YOU KNOW I THINK IT BE SOLVABLE THE PROBLEM IS. THERE'S THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF I MEAN EVEN THE DESTROYED LOOK AT THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS SANTA SUZANNA MOUNTAINS WHERE-WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT. SORT OF MANUFACTURING ASSETS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NORTH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BREWERIES AEROSPACE YOU NAME IT FIND A REASON GAS FIELD BY THE WAY THAT NEEDS THE POWER ON TO MAINTAIN SOME SAFETY OUT THERE. AND IT'S ALL. IT'S ALL AT RISK I WANTED TO ASK MS CABINETS REALLY APPRECIATE THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. I'M THIS MADE HERE THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WE'RE HERE ELEVEN YEARS LATER AND THE SAME CONVERSATION IT'S APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE AND PEOPLE THAT YOU REPRESENT TOO OFTEN ARE LEFT BEHIND I'M GLAD THERE'S AN EMERGING COALITION HERE OF. YOU KNOW BIG INDUSTRY AND. PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO OFTEN HIDDEN FROM VIEW IN THAT WE ALL WE LEAVE BEHIND FAR TOO OFTEN I WANT TO GET A SENSE THOUGH HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK. YOU WERE GETTING AT THIS ISSUE OF HOW DO YOU AREN'T BEING COUNTED YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE POPULATION THAT'S TRULY RISK HERE YOU MENTIONED A F. N. AS A SORT OF DESIGNATION. ACCESS FUNCTIONAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS. I THINK OBVIOUSLY COULD BE BROADER THAN NAPA GIVE A SENSE OF SORT OF COMPARING WHAT YOU SEE IN A MINUTE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER. NUMBER'S VERSES WHAT YOU SEE IN THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND WHAT THE GAP COULD BE. I WISH I HAD BETTER NUMBERS FOR YOU BUT I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU CONCEPTS IN RESPONSE. A MEDICAL BASS LINE IS ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE VULNERABLE AT RISK HOUSEHOLDS AND IT'S NOT INTENDED AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. TODAY AS AN EMERGENCY DESIGNATION MEDICAL BASELINE AT ITS ESSENCE IS A RATE. IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY AT A LOWER RATE FOR PEOPLE WHOSE USAGE IS DRIVEN BY MEDICAL NEED. AND THAT'S VERY APPRECIATED BUT IT'S NOT AN IDENTIFIER FOR PEOPLE WHO RELY ON ELECTRICITY FOR HEALTH. JUST TO GIVE THE MOST SIMPLE EXAMPLE THE PEOPLE WHO RELY ON REFER TRADING THEIR MEDICATION. IT DOESN'T DRIVE ADDITIONAL ENERGY USAGE. AND YET THEIR HEALTH IS VERY DEPENDENT ON RELIABLE ENERGY SO. THEN YOU ADD TO THAT THAT. EVEN FOR THE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE MEDICAL BASELINE IS SEEMS TO BE VERY UNDER SUBSCRIBED AND THE CPUC HAS JUST FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER REALLY MANDATED THAT THE UTILITIES DO A MORE AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH PROGRAM TO ATTEMPT TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN MEDICAL BASELINE. ON THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF. PERHAPS THE MAYOR WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLACE TO SPEAK TO THIS CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE REGISTRIES OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT THEY MAINTAIN FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OF MEDICALLY FRAGILE I'M MORE OR OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE OF CUSTOMERS ARE RESIDENTS AND THOSE ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN THE MEDICAL BASELINE POPULATION SO ON THIS SOME STRUCTURE TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THE UTILITIES AND COUNTIES TO EXCHANGE THOSE LISTS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HIPPA. AND OTHER PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE BUT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY EXPAND THE UNIVERSE AND ONE POSSIBILITY THAT I'VE RAISED AT CPAC HEARINGS IS THE UTILITY IS PROVIDING INFORMATION AND THEN RESOURCES TO COUNTIES SO THAT THE COUNTIES COULD USE THEIR OWN LISTS WHICH WOULD AVOID THE NEED FOR ACTUALLY EXCHANGING INFORMATION BUT WOULDN'T SHIFT THE BURDEN ENTIRELY TO THE COUNTIES. TO NOW TAKE ON THIS NOTIFICATION PROCESS. AGAIN I AM WORKING IN THE ABSTRACT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD REALLY HELP THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF THE UTILITIES PROVIDE THE RESOURCES. AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THEIR EXISTING IDENTIFIERS OF VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS AS A PRIORITY LIST I THINK IT'S IS THE SMART IDEA AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SELF. WELL AS A SUPPLEMENT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE RELIED ON AS WE ARE NOW BUT I DO THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH MORE WILLING TO SELF IDENTIFY IF THEY KNEW. THERE COULD BE SOME BENEFIT OF THEM DOING SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SOLUTION SO. IF YOU ARE LIVING IN A NURSING ASSISTANT FACILITY AND YOU KNOW THA IF YOU AND YOUR FELLOW RESIDENTS WHO LIVE THERE MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR. A DISCOUNT ON A SOLAR BATTERY YSTEM TO BE INSTALLED IF YOU GUYS JUST SIGN UP AND CLICK ON. ON POWER DOWN NOW THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING TO SAY LIKE YES WE HAVE A NEED PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY STEP FORWARD AND START IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES I KNOW I MEAN I THINK OF WHAT. THE MTA COULD DO SORT OF MORE COMPREHENSIVELY TO ADDRESS YOUR VULNERABLE NEEDS AND I LIKE I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GOT THAT PROCESS STARTED THAT INVENTORY IN BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S EASIER TO COORDINATE. A BUNCH OF YOU KNOW SORT OF LARGE CRITICAL INDUSTRIES MUCH HARDER HERE SOMEONE FROM MISTER MURDER SHAW. I MEAN HOW QUICKLY COULD YOU GO TO A CLIENT LIKE ONE OF THESE AFN HOUSEHOLDS AND GET UP. SMALL SCALE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO NECESSARILY HANDLE A CEMENT PLANT BUT SMALL ENOUGH TO HANDLE YOUR TEN PEOPLE LIVING IN NURSING IS ASSISTED FACILITY. HOW QUICKLY COULD YOU GET A SOLAR STORAGE PROJECT UP AND RUNNING. BARRING ANY COMPLICATIONS WITH THE INTERACTION OR THE APPROVAL BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. REMARKS AT FOR YOU OKAY LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM FROM WEEKS TO MONTHS. BUT FOR SMALLER SYSTEMS IT'S USUALLY ON THE ORDER OF JUST A FEW MONTHS. AND SO ARE YOU AWARE OF. SO THEY ARE THEY'RE IMPEDIMENTS IN OTHER WORDS TO GETTING THOSE SOLAR STORAGE SYSTEM SAY UP AND RUNNING IN FOR CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT TO INTERCONNECT. GENERALLY WHAT WE HEAR FROM OUR MEMBER COMPANIES IS THAT BECAUSE STORAGE IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO. HAVE JUST AND ARE VERY SLOW TO APPROVE THE PERMITS EITHER DON'T HAVE. OTHER QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO GO OUT BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION THE ADOPTION OF STORAGE. SO JUST GETTING THE PERMITS APPROVED HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE AND THEN FOR LARGER SYSTEMS MAY BE A SYSTEM SERVING A LARGE S. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY OR NURSING HOME. THAT. YOU THEN CAN RUN INTO INTERACTION CHALLENGES WITH UTILITY BECAUSE UTILITY. BEING CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS THEY WANT TO ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF THE STORAGE UNIT ASSUMING THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT IT CHARGES AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. AND VICE VERSA. SO THAT OFTEN ENTAILS A COMPLEX ENGINEERING REVIEW. SO WOULD STREAMLINED PERMITTING PROCESS SEES THOUGH HELP ESPECIALLY WITH HONORABLE POPULATIONS YES. AND SO LAST QUESTION HERE IS THAT THERE'S A PERMITTING ELEMENT IS SORT OF THE COORDINATION CYBER THERE'S ALSO FINANCING ON IT THESE THINGS COST MONEY AND EVERYONE SENSITIVE TO ADDING MORE PRESSURE ON TO THE RATE BASE OF COURSE AND I GET THAT BOTH FORD LARGE INDUSTRIAL USERS AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW FIXED INCOME AND USERS. ARE THERE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING TO BEYOND THE RATE BASE TO HELP SUPPLEMENT AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE OR OTHER I. MEAN CERTAINLY ON AN IN IS IN A HAVE. ANY HOW DO WE GET CREATIVE ABOUT COBBLING TOGETHER FINANCING BECAUSE I. I'D LIKE TO SEE A WILLINGNESS FROM HIS LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP. AND PUT A CHUNK OF FUNDING FOR BEYOND THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STATE FACILITIES FOR BACKUP POWER. TO REALLY DO SOMETHING BIG HERE BUT- HOW DO WE SORT OF. WHAT IS THE PRIVATE STE WHAT COULD THE PRIVATE STAKE LOOK LIKE IN THERE HOW COULD WE PULL IN POTENTIALLY OTHER CREATIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND REALLY START TO. AT LEAST. ELISE GET MOVING RIGHT WE MAKE A BILL TO COVER EVERYONE AT LEAST TO GET STARTED ANY ANY THOUGHTS MISCAST. THIS IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE AND SO ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN READING OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. BUT THERE IS. CERTAINLY INTEREST AND. MOVEMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF ABOUT TRYING TO WORK WITH THE LARGE PUBLIC INSURERS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID NOW. TO SEE IF THERE COULD BE OPTIONS FOR COVERAGE ON THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD COVER FOR EXAMPLE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. TO SAY SOMEONE WHO NEEDS THAT EQUIPMENT ALSO NEEDS THE ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT. DURING A TIME OF DESTRUCTION I DO NOT PERSONALLY HAVE INFORMATION ON WHETHER THIS HAS ACTUALLY MOVED BEYOND THE BRAINSTORMING STAGE AND WHETHER THERE'S WORK ACTUALLY UNDER WAY BUT I DO KNOW AT LEAST IT IS. A CONCEPT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE INITIAL DISCUSSION. RIGHT WE LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AND IS AND IS FAR FROM LIKE A CITY OR- AT THE MUNICIPAL UTILITY PERSPECTIVE. YOUR YOUR RATE BASE IS OR YOUR RATE BASE OR YOUR MARGINS HE SERVICES BUDGETS AND ARE THESE THINGS% YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY EVEN AT A MUNICIPAL LEVEL WHAT YOU'RE CRITICAL ASSETS ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN BE DOING NOTE TO BACKSTOP THAT OR EVEN WITHIN EAST BAY MUD I MEAN. YOU'RE ALSO I MEAN WATER DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WASTE DISTRICTS EVERYONE'S LIABLE ALSO POTENTIALLY WE HAVING LAWSUITS AGAINST LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS IN VENTURA COUNTY RIGHT NOW AFTER THOMAS FIRE FOR THEIR PUMPS FAILING. AT WHETHER DUE TO NEGLIGENCE OR JUST WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD LIABLE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIRE DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR PUMP SYSTEMS GOING SO HOW PROACTIVE. ART ARE YOU GUYS ABLE TO GET IN TERMS OF GETTING YOUR BUT YOU'RE SORT OF EITHER RATE BASED OR GENERAL FUND HEADED SOME. OF THE STUFF SO YOU DON'T SEE THOSE BIG FAILURE POINTS. THE PER HEALDSBURG YOU'RE MORE THAN A DECADE AGO THE CITY MAN AN EFFORT TO PUT BACK UP GENERATION AND ALL OF OUR CRITICAL FACILITIES FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT CITY HALL AT OUR WATER FACILITIES WASTE WATER FACILITIES SO WE HAVE A LOT OF BACKUP GENERATION IT'S DIESEL IT'S NOT CLEAN BUT IS THERE AND AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN PRODUCE WATER INTRIGUE WATER AND THEN WE HAVE A FLEET OF BOWL GENERATION THAT WE RUN AROUND TO OUR VARIOUS COLLECTIONS STATIONS PUMP STATIONS TO KEEP THAT WATER WASTEWATER. FACILITIES GOING YOU KNOW IT IS DIESEL. TO BE NICE TO HAVE A CLEANER TECHNOLOGY I MEAN THE CONCEPT OF BATTERY STORAGE IS A GREAT IDEA. IN IN THE FACT THAT YOU POTENTIALLY COULD USE A BETTER STORAGE YEAR ROUND VERSUS JUST A ONE TIME EVENT. WERE BACK OF DIESEL GENERATION IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU HOW THE EVENT GOING ON THERE BUT- AGAIN THE COST OF BATTERY STORAGE AND THE SIZE OF THE UNIT SO WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT INTO SUSTAIN A FOUR DAY FIVE DAY. OUTAGE THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. SO WE DISCUSS REPAIRS GENERAL FUND LIMITATIONS. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. AND THEN. IT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT MICROGRAPH PERTINENTES AS WELL FOR FIRE STATIONS I KNOW WE'VE HAD A FEW LA FIRE STATIONS THAT THE PORTER RANCH AREA THEY JUST GOTTA MICROGRAPH OF YOU GUYS START LOOKING AT THAT. SO I DID FALL SOME THE ARTICLES THAT WERE ON THE FIRE STATION IN THE MICRO GET THOSE PUT IN THERE AND THERE WAS OF A FAIRLY LARGE GRANITIC FROM THE CDC. THAT THAT SUPPORTED THAT OPPORTUNITY I'M NOT SURE THE SIZE OF THAT BATTERY SYSTEM AND WITH THAT SUSTAIN ANOTHER FOUR DAYS OF SHUT DOWN I MEAN THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGES. A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW IT HAS A WALL PACK AND THOSE ARE REALLY. TWO TO FOUR TO SIX HOURS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DAYS. OF OUTAGES AND SO. REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE FINDING THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR THE- FOR THE PROBLEM YOU'LL CELLS. YOU'LL CELLS AS AN OPTION YOU KNOW SWITCHING FROM. DIESEL BACK UP TO NATURAL GAS THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH NATURAL GAS IS DURING THE SENATE ROSE FIRES. OUR ENTIRE CITY LOS NATURAL GAS SERVICE. MY LAST COMMUNICATION LESS NATURAL GAS SERVICES SO EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T NESTLE AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE FIRES THOSE SERVICES WERE GONE DURING THAT TWO TO THREE DAY PERIOD. SO DEAL FUELING DURING THOSE BACK UP SITUATION IS CERTAINLY A MAJOR FOR DIESEL SIMILAR IS A SIMILAR ISSUE IN MY STUPID ANALOGY OF ME WITH A PICK UP TRUCK CONVOY TRYING TO GET OUT PCH WITH A BUNCH OF. RED YOU KNOW PLASTIC JUGS OF DIESEL BUT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT AND WE HAD SENATOR MCGUIRE MAKING PHONE CALLS TO FEELING COMPANIES TO GET FUEL INTO HEALDSBURG SO THAT WE COULD CONTINUE. TO RUN THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES BUT. YEAH I THINK I THINK BETTER SORTS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF SOLUTION BUT I THINK THERE FUNDING THERE'S NEEDS TO BE FUNDING OR SOME SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION. REALLY BRIEFLY MEXICO JUST YES WELL THANK YOU FOR ASKING SO I IS IT RELATES TO THE BACK OF POWER WE WENT WITH DIESEL FOR THE PORTABLE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WERE HERE I SO WE ARE UNDER THIRTY FIVE PUMP. HI AT OUR- MAIN FACILITIES LIKE OUR WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT WILL THAT WE HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT TO. COULD BE RUN ENTIRELY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT WE GENERATE AT THE PLANT SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS A PRETTY SAFE OPERATION. AT OUR WASTE WHAT ARE EXCUSE ME IN OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANTS SO WHICH WE HAVE A NUMBER. ADD THOSE ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW STATIONARY GENERATORS THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY. FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WILL BE IN A POSITION TO KEEP THEM RUNNING. WE HAVE REFINERS IN THE SERVICE AREA WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS PURCHASE ORDERS A PRE ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DIESEL THAT WE NEED FOR OUR. GENERATOR SYSTEMS IF YOU'RE A CREATIVE DISTRICT YOU'VE BEEN DOING PATH BREAKING WORK ON WASTE WATER TO ENERGY AND EVER WASTE ENERGY AND- I MEAN. DIESEL THAT'S REALLY THAT'S THE WHOLE THAT'S THE PLAN RIGHT NOW. WELL THAT IS WHEN YOU'RE TOLD THAT YOU HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT DO BY THE TIME YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS RIGHT. THE ONLY THING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE TO WIN AND YOU'RE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO GO AWAY AND NOT BE THE SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE. YOU GO OUT AND YOU LEASE THE GENERATORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MAKE THIS THING YOU KNOW GET US THROUGH THIS FIRE SEASON. HOME WE GET DONE WITH THIS WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCES AND WE HAVE A CONVERSATION COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NEXT READ THE IN AND WHEN THEY ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DEVELOPED THAT ALLOW COST EFFECTIVELY TO YES MASS STORE SOLAR ENERGY. FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAY OUTAGES AT LEAST PUMPING PLANTS AND WE PUSH. WATER UP HILL IT'S HEAVY AND IT TAKES LESS ENERGY TO. SO THE TO IF WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE WILL BE FIRST IN LINE AS YOU KNOW WE TRY TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE FRONT FOR SOME MONEY. TO INVEST PLEASE LET US KNOW WE CAN DO TO HELP I MEAN THAT'S THAT WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT A MONTH HERE. THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE VEHICLES MOVING IT TAKES AWHILE FOR THE PC TO GET GOING. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT ROUND A WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. TO GET THIS PART THIS STARTED BECAUSE THEY WERE. THEY JUST APPROVED ON. AND THEY ADDS FROM WHAT MY PERSPECTIVE IS POULTRY MITIGATION STRATEGIES AS- HAVING MODES OF MOBILE GENERATION SYSTEMS ON TRUCKS TO DRIVE AROUND AND I GUESS THEY NEED TO DEPLOY THESE STRATEGIES BUT. YOU KNOW SOME TRUCKS TO GET THERE AFTER THE FACT OR RESPONSE TO IT YOU KNOW AFTER THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN IS INSUFFICIENT SO I I'VE FOUGHT THE UC AS MUCH AS THE TILL THESE FOR THE INADEQUACY OF THE STRATEGIES BUT I ALSO THINK. THEY CAN GET CREATIVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US TO START TO REMEDY THIS NOW BUT I JUST I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT TILL JANUARY SO. LET'S LET'S GET CREATIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN YEAH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND BE PART OF THIS PANEL OF THE IT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION AND I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT. TODAY SO THANK YOU AND WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO AT THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE TODAY AS WELL PEOPLE FOR THEIR PATIENTS HEY YOU'RE AT THE END OF THE LINE IN THE END OF THE AGENDA SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT AND- WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE SO. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ALLEY CANNING TEN AND THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING TODAY I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS US SEE A FILE SEE OR IT IS WHAT WE CALL IT IS A STATE WIDE MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION OF TWENTY THREE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS REPRESENTING FIFTY SIX OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OUR MISSION IS TO INCREASE ACCESS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BY INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS OR I'LL SEE YOU ARE RUN BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COLLECTIVELY THE CENTERS SERVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND FOLKS WHO ARE AGING AROUND THE STATE. FOLKS WITH ALSO SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AND IDENTITIES THE IOC'S ARE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND REACHING US THEIR SELF DETERMINATION. AN INDEPENDENT LIVING GOALS SO FOR OVER TEN YEARS SEE IF I'LL SEE AS PRIORITIZE DISASTER READINESS AND MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE AGING AND HAVE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. SO SEE IF I'LL SEE IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP OF FOR DISASTER STRATEGIES COALITION. AND SEE IF I'LL SEE HAS OVER THE YEARS HAVE PROVIDED SUPPORT HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS. IMPACTED BY THE DISASTERS BY LOANING AND GIVING. ALL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WHEEL CHAIRS WALKERS A SPEECH DEVICES EXCEPT TRUCK. SO ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND WE HAVE PROVIDED TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND FEMA DURING AND AFTER DISASTER. WE CAN ALL SAY THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO MEDICAID DISASTERS SEE IF I WAS HE BELIEVES THAT THE CPUC AS WELL AS ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS THE CPUC. HAS NOT INCORPORATED SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES THAT SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES AND THOSE WHO ARE AGING AND REQUIRED THE DEVICES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. AND I WON'T GO DOWN THAT LIST BECAUSE I THINK WE KNOW THEM BY NOW WHILE YOU KNOW. THERE ARE. WHEN THEY'RE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE POWER SHUT OFF BECAUSE THERE'S MORE AVAILABLE TO US TO US THEN DURING A NATURAL DISASTER. SO HOW ARE WE INFORMING PEOPLE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS OF THIS THE ENERGIZED ATION HOW'RE WE EVEN TELLING FOLKS THAT THEY ARE A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY I KNOW I DIDN'T. AND SO HOW ARE HOW ARE WE PROVIDING RESOURCES IN TRAINING RECENTLY AT SEA OF FILES HE PUBLISHED A VERY SHORT QUICK SURVEY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AN AGING COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT OUR NEEDS MAY BE THIS IS A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT IT WILL HELP INFORM. THE ACTIONS MOVING FORWARD AS WE ARE THE EXPERTS IN OUR OWN LIVES AND ARE AND WHAT WE NEED I WAS SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO SHARE THESE RESULTS WITH THE STAKE WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE- BY IN FAR ARE COMMITTED TO AND THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS TO BRIDGE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH I SEE IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THANK YOU I KNOW I WENT OVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMING AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE TODAY TO THINK IN THE COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK OU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE IT MY NAME'S DANNY ANDERSON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OR I'LL SEE IS ALLEY. MENTIONED THAT COVERS INTEREST IN A BARBER IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES. I AM I WAS STRUCK TODAY BY THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON LOCALLY AND I THINK THAT SENATOR STERN REALLY TOUCHED ON SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE- EXPERIENCING IN OUR AREA WHICH IS. THE LAYERS OF NEEDS WE TALK ABOUT THE POWER SHUT OFF SEN. AND I GETTHAT THAT WAS THE MAIN SUBJECT TODAY BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER NEEDS ASSOCIATED TO WHEN WE HAVE A POWER SHUT OFF WICH WE'RE DEALING WITH ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE ARE RECEIVING ALL THESE GUIDES FROM THE COUNTY AND FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAYING. HOW YOU CAN PREPARE FOR THE POWER SHUT OFF BUT THERE. IS AN INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND LIVE BY THEMSELVES ARE NOT IN NURSING FACILITIES LIKE ME I LIVE BY MYSELF. I COULD NOT SET UP A GENERATOR. I COULDN'T PHYSICALLY DO IT I'M LUCKY I HAVE FAMILY THAT WOULD COME OVER AND HELP ME IF THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO DO. BUT THAT'S NOT THE STORY FOR EVERYONE SO WE'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE. ON THAT WE SERVE TO GET A DIFFERENT KIND OF BACK UP SYSTEM THAT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE. HOWEVER THESE GUYS ALSO SAY THINGS LIKE. WELL YOU'RE GOING TO GET NOTICED IN TWO DAYS GO AND STAY WITH A FRIEND. OKAY I CAN'T DRIVE I'M RELY ON DIAL WRITER PARA TRANSIT. I HAVE TO CALL AND MAKE THAT RESERVATION A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME. THERE'S NO WAY I COULD EVEN GET TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE AND BY THE WAY WHEN I GET TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE CAN I GET INTO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE CAN I USE THE RESTROOM AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE. THESE ARE ALL THE LAYERS THAT WE EXPERIENCE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WERE SO SCARED OF THESE POWERS SHUT OFFS BUT REALLY THE POWER SHUT OFF IS THE ROOT. AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER COMPONENTS TO THE ISSUES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND ALSO IF I CAN JUST VERY RESPECTFULLY. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WE HATE THAT. SO IF WE COULD BE CALLED PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR THOSE RELIANT ON ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY. WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SOME THANK YOU FOR THE SUGGESTION. AND IN THE COMMENTS MUCH APPRECIATED TODAY NEXT THE. VERY MUCH PHONE IN THIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE TODAY YES BYNARI BUT THAT THAT'S FINE MY NAME IS CONNIE ARNOLD I LIVE IN ELK GROVE. BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS FOR OVER THIRTY PLUS YEARS. I'M HERE BECAUSE- WHAT IS BEING DONE WITH THESE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. IS TERRIBLE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS WHO ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND AGAIN. BY A THIS CPUC AND THE UTILITY COMPANIES AND BEING TOLD TO PLAN FOR OUR OWN OUTAGE. PLANS FOR PROVIDING OUR OWN POWER NEEDS GO TO A HOSPITAL GO TO A LOCAL SHELTER. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE EXISTENT. AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THESE UTILITY COMPANIES WHETHER THEIR PROFIT OR PROFIT ORIENTED AND PRIVATE OR PUBLIC TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE VULNERABLE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN LIKE PROVISION OF A SOLAR POWER BACK UP RESIDENTIAL BATTERY POWERED SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED LIKE IT'S BEEN DONE IN VERMONT. IN VERMONT. FOR TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS BY GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER. WHICH PROVIDED A ONE TIME OF FEE CHARGE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTH PAYMENTS. FOR INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS THE VULNERABLE SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE GIVEN AT NO COST. OF THE BACKUP BATTERY BATTERY POWER SYSTEMS SOLAR BATTERY POWER SYSTEMS. IT WHICH WAS INSTALLED FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS. SO. PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO BE GOING TO A HOSPITAL. THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDING TO SET UP INTERMITTENT EMERGENCY SHELTERS THAT PROVIDER NEEDS THERE ISN'T A GOOD TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET OUR POPULATION TO THOSE SITES ASSUMING THE PERSON COULD MAYBE THEIR BED RIDDEN. MAYBE THEY THEY CAN'T EASILY BE TRANSPORTED THERE ARE ALL THESE OBSTACLES NOW I HAD A FRIEND WHO LOST HER HOUSE. IN THE PARADISE FIRE. HER AND HER MOTHER. BARELY GOT OUT OF THAT HOUSE. WITH WHAT THEY HAD AND RUSHED TO THE CAR AND THE ONLY NEW THERE WAS A FIRE BECAUSE THEY COULD FEEL THE HEAT FROM THE HOUSE ON FIRE NEXT DOOR. AND THEIR HOUSE PARISH. AND THEY BARELY MADE IT OUT THERE WERE A LOT OF SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT DIED IN THAT FIRE AND I FOR ONE DO NOT WANT TO BE PUT IN THAT PREDICAMENT. SO THE IT'S ALREADY BEEN STATED THAT YOU KNOW WE RELY ON ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIRS I HAVE AN ELECTRIC BED I HAVE AN ELECTRIC AIR MATTRESS. I EIGHT NEED AIR CONDITIONING I CAN'T TOLERATE SUPER HE- SUPER COLD THE WHOLE NINE YARDS SO. THERE'S PEOPLE WITH HOME ELEVATORS ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENERGY COULD JUST BE SHUT OFF AND THEIR STOCK. AND THEIR TRAP ORDER SENIOR CITIZENS OR PEOPLE DISABILITIES THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANUALLY OPEN THEIR GARAGE DOOR. NOR CAN THEY DO THAT. AND I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING. YOU KNOW THAT AND ARTICLES WRITTEN RECENTLY BY EIGHT ON NORTH BAY BOHEMIAN CALLED USED ABOUT THE P. JEANNIE AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY POURED INTO SOME OTHER FOUNDATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S TIME FROM THAT ARTICLE THAT THE PRIVATE UTILITY COMPANIES BE TAKEN OVER AND BECOME PUBLIC UTILITIES BECAUSE IT CONCERNS ME IF LEGISLATORS ARE MEMBERS OF THE C. P. C. P. YOU SEE ARE BEING WINED AND DINED. BY SOME OF THESE. C. E. O.'S. YOU KNOW THAT HOW DOES THAT HOLD THE PUBLIC INTEREST AT HEART OF THE COMMISSIONERS OR- YOU KNOW MEMBER CENTER ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT HELP US SO I MEAN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NOT ONLY SHOULD A BACKUP RESIDENTIAL BATTERY POWERED SYSTEM BE PROVIDED BUT ALSO NOT KNOX BOX UNITS COULD BE INSTALLED THAT ONLY EARLY MERCHANTS HE PARAMEDICAL PEOPLE. X. WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A PERSON'S HOME AND I HAD TO SIT HERE AND LAUGH WHEN I HEARD P. JEANNIE STATE. THAT THEY SEND A TRUCK OUT IF THEY CAN'T REACH YOU. BUT IF THE PERSON CAN'T GET OUT OF BED AND DOESN'T COME TO THE DOOR THEY JUST LEAVE A- LITTLE HANGER ON THEIR DOOR THAT THEY WERE THERE. THIS SIDE WE DO HAVE YOUR LETTER. THAT YOU KNOW YOU GOT MY LETTER IS SO YEAH. ADD FIVE LETTERS AND I JUST WANT TO STATE SOMETHING MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE I DID LIKE TO HEAR SOME PEOPLE SAYING. ARMS IF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION CAN'T BE DESIGNATED FOR FUNDING FOR THE SOLUTIONS WE NEED SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS WE WILL DO THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO AN THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. HE SURE TO MAKE SURE I ONLY HAD FIVE WILL MAKE FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS I HAD A PRINTER PROBLEM AT THE END. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT FOR IT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY. MISTER CHAIR ADD CORPS IN JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECH NET FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS pIMPORTANT TO DISCUSS. ON THE IMPACTS OF THE INTERNALIZATION WILL HAVE ON CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES TECHNIQUES DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES ADVANCE ENERGY COMPANIES AND ALSO TECH AND TELECOM COMPANIES WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON ON INTERRUPTED ENERGY SUPPLIES. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES DEPEND ON A LEVEL OF LIABILITY OF RELIABILITY THAT THE GREAT HAS SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE. NOW IS THE INTERNALIZATION AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING MAJOR PORTIONS OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED MORE TOOLS LIKE SOLAR AND MICROGRAMS. A LOSS OF POWER CAN HAVE CREATES VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS BUT ALSO VERY SERIOUS FINANCIAL IMPACT OUR MEMBER COMPANIES BUT ALSO CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL ECONOMY. THIRTY DIESEL BACKUP GENERATORS CANNOT BE THE TOOL RE REACH FOR TECH NET URGES SUPPORT FOR ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES THAT ARE ABLE TO RIDE THROUGH OUTAGES AND RESTORE THE SYSTEM MORE RAPIDLY AFTER AN OUTAGE INCLUDING RENEWABLE AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOURCES. MICROGRAPHS ARE ONE SUCH SOLUTION THAT CAN ALLOW MEMBER COMPANIES TO MANAGE THEIR ENERGY NEEDS AND DO SO SUSTAINABLY. WE NEED TO SET RULES FOR MICROGRAMS AND ENSURE THAT ENERGY CUSTOMERS ARE EMPOWERED TO BE PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL EFFORTS TO MANAGE CLIMATE IMPACTS. AND COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HELLO MY NAME IS ALLEY TRAIL AND I'M AN INDEPENDENT CLEAN ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY PROFESSIONAL AND SUSTAINABILITY ACADEMIC. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO RECEIVE AN ACCREDITED BACHELORS DEGREE OF SUSTAINABILITY AT THE GLOBAL INSTITUTE OF. SUSTAINABILITY AT ARIZONA STATE WAS RANKED NUMBER ONE IN INNOVATION AND TWENTY NINETEEN. I WHAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND ALSO THE P. YOU SEE FOR ADDRESSING RESILIENCY IN THE ASTOR PROCEEDING THAT'S ON GOING RIGHT NOW. AND BUILDING ON WHAT OTHERS TOUCH ON EARLIER I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MY GRADES IS A CRITICAL SOLUTION TO MITIGATING IMPACTS PSCS ARE COMMUNITIES. RESILIENCY IS INHERENTLY LOCAL AND MICRO GRIDS CAN PROVIDE LOCAL SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE IN A DISTRIBUTED FASHION. THE DEAL WE AND AN INDUSTRY ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF MY GRADES IS A GROUP OF INTERCONNECTED LOADS AND DISTRIBUTE ENERGY RESOURCES WITH A CLEARLY DEFINED ELECTRICAL BOUNDARIES. THAT ACT AS A SINGLE CONTROLLABLE ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE GRAD AND CAN DISCONNECT AUTONOMOUSLY. MICROGRAPH OUR TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THEY HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF GENERATION STORAGE AND CONTROLS THAT CAN BE PART OF THE MAKER GREG. SO I URGE MIKE LAWMAKERS AND POLICY MAKERS TO CREATE POLICIES THAT PROVIDE RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPECIFICALLY AND PUBLIC AGENCIES TO PARTNER WITH DEVELOPERS TO CONSTRUCT THESE RESILIENCY PROJECTS. A TYPICAL COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PROJECT THAT MIGHT HAVE HVAC LIGHTING AND MY GROUP CONTROLS COST ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT. THE MICROCOMPUTER INS FOR RECENT PROJECT COST ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD TO THE PROJECT. SO A REAL EXAMPLE COULD BE A CITY THAT HAS A COUPLE COMMUNITY FACILITIES DESIGNATED SCHOOLING IS OWNED BY THE UTILITY. THIS KIND OF PROJECT THAT I'VE JUST READ ABOUT IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS. ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE A COMPONENT WITH HISTORIC INTEREST RATES THESE PROJECTS CAN BE FINANCED WITH TO HELP STE WHICH IS TAX EXEMPT LEASE PURCHASES AND OTHER FINANCING VEHICLES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DEVOTED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES. THREE POINT 1% INTEREST. THAT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER ENTITIES ARE PROPOSING THEIR INTEREST RATES BE NOW. SO THESE ARE TYPICALLY TWENTY YEAR AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE NO CAPITAL OUTLAY AN IMMEDIATE SAVINGS OVER NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES. I JUST TALK WITH THE AGENCY LAST WEEK THAT SIDE THEY'RE RENTING TWENTY NINE DIESEL GENERATORS AT A COST OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOUR MONTHS. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE FUEL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED OR HAVE THESE GENERATORS OPERATE SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. SO IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL INVESTED MIKE REGRETS FOR THE PUBLIC AGENCIES SO I'M REALLY HAPPY TO VOLUNTEER TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE MORE ON THIS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY WE SHOULD. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON NOT YOUR MOM ON BEHALF OF CAPSTONE TURBINES. CAPTAIN OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURER OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MAKER TURBINE. MAC MICROTURBINES. SERVING MEDIUM AND LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS AND MORE CLEAN AND EFFICIENT SOFT GENERATIONAL TURN IT IS. THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO INCENTIVIZE MEDIUM LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS. THAT ARE INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT FOR RESILIENCY TO MAKE THE CLEANEST WAYS POSSIBLE ALREADY THERE'S A SELF GENERATION CENTER PROGRAM BUT THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO. FEED IN TARIFF PROGRAMS CAN BE EXPANDED TO ALL CLEAN AND EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTED GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES. FALLS AXTEL TRUNCHEON PROGRAMS AT THE TREASURES OFFICE CAN BE EXPANDED. WE THINK THAT THE CHEN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT BEFORE YOU RETURN. BECAUSE THE BETTER THE SOONER THE THAT A CONSUMERS CAN START MAKING CLEAR. CHOICES THE BETTER APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON I AGREE HEARING PANELISTS ARE REALLY HEALTHY DISCUSSION MY NAME IS WILL ABRAMS ALSO PARTY TO THE IDEA JERSEY XIN PROCEEDING BEFORE THE CPUC. RESIDENT A CINEMA COUNTY AND WHILE FIRST RUBBER SO WITH THESE ISSUES ARE PERSONAL TO ME. ARM AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT I THINK THAT THE WAY TO REALLY APPROACH THIS IS A SORT OF A SOLUTION ORIENTATION. IS FOR PAPER FOR PERFORMANCE SO A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE UTILITIES IS ACTIVITIES THESE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WILL DO. SO LIKE COMMUNICATIONS SHOULDN'T MATTER TO ANY OF US IN THIS ROOM IF THEY SAID MAILERS OR THEY HAVE A SUPERBOWL AD IN TERMS OF HOW THEY COMMUNICATE ALL THOSE THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THEY DESCRIBE THAT THE FREE SHOULDER CUSTOMERS. WHAT WE CARE ABOUT OUR CONSUMERS EDUCATED HAVE THE DO THEY KNOW HOW TO RUN THE GENERATOR WITHOUT CAUSING A FIRE DO THEY KNOW HOW TO RUN. EXTENSION CORDS SO BEING ABLE TO. COMPENSATE THEM AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AROUND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS I SEE IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT MOTIVATION. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND THAT GOES FOR DE ENERGISED ATION ISSUES BUT ALSO GENERALLY SPEAKING WHILE FIRE MITIGATION ISSUES. AND UNTIL WE START PRYING RETURN ON EQUITY FOR OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. ARE RATE PAY REIMBURSEMENT UNTIL WE START TYING THOSE THINGS TO EACH AND EVERY MITIGATION. I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE A PATH FORWARD SO THAT'S RELATING TO KEY AS WE LOOK FORWARD. AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO SUBMIT TOWARDS THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE APPRECIATE IT AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING THEM SO PLEASE DO. THANK YOU THINK AT OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. CNN NO ONE WILL OF. WHAT THIS WAS A ONE FOUR HEARING TODAY A LITTLE LONG FOR OF MANY OF US BUT- I THINK WE'VE REALLY. CAN SEE WHERE THE HILL. THIS IS ONE WILD FIRE MITIGATION TOOL THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. IN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TAKING STEPS TO GET THERE AND TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THE REAL PROCESSES OF THE CPUC IS. THERE CONSIDERING MANY OF THESE CONCERNS IN THAT NEXT PHASE OF THE PC PS PS PROCEEDINGS AND- AND I URGE THE CPUC TO TAKE UP THESE ISSUES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE ONE THING WE ARE TODAY. IS THAT THIS ISN'T URGENT AND TIMELY MANNER. MATTER THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO THAT WE CAN GET IT AS RIGHT AS POSSIBLE SO THE ANSWERS TO MANY OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED. A CANNOT WAIT. UNTIL ALL THE FACTORS ARE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY WE MUST CREATE AN INTER FROST SAYS. THAT CAN GET US TO WHERE WE CAN HAVE A SAFE SYSTEM. A BALANCED SYSTEM AND ONE THAT WILL WORK FOR ALL OF US AND THAT WE CAN REFINE IT OVER TIME THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR A STAFF AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR THANKS PEOPLE WERE MENTIONING HEALTH THOROUGH THE- THE BACKGROUND PAPER WAS. AND I WANT TO THANK OF ALARM IF WILLIAMS. WHO IS SITTING TO MY LEFT FOR HER GREAT WORK TODAY IN CREATING THAT CRAFTING IT. PUT IT TOGETHER SHE'S THE CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND ALSO MY CHEEK. AFTER THANK YOU. LORD FOR GREAT JOB THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE HERE INTEGER
