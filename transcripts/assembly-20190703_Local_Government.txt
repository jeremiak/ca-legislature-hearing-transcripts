OF SOME OF COUNTIES A CERTAIN SIZE -- WE WERE ALL SELECTED. IN DISTRICTS ELECTED IN DISTRICTS THAT WERE DRAWN UP BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS -- BECAUSE I THINK THE VOTERS BY CORRECTLY RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE.

CHAIR MEMBERS NICHOLS HAD ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE'RE PROUDCO SPONSOR THAT'S THE ONE THIRTY NINETY SURE OF FAIR AND INDEPENDENT COUNTY REDUCING PROCESS AND CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES. A GERRYMANDERING IS NO PLACE OUR DEMOCRACY TO ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. GERRYMANDERING HARMS PUBLIC TRUST IN FAIRNESS WERE PROCESS UNDERMINES REPRESENTED NATURE OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ENTERPRISE VOTERS THE ABILITY TO HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS WHEN IT COMES TO STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE TO ELIMINATE GERRYMANDERING. CALIFORNIA STATE CITIZENS REDUCING COMMISSION WHICH REMOVES FROM PROCESS AND COMMENTS WITH NO ELECTORAL SELF INTEREST AND HAVE LINES ARE DRAWN. IS CONSIDERED THE NATIONAL GOLD STANDARD BY NOT ONLY REFORMERS BUT ALSO ACADEMICS WHO STUDY THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL EXTENDS THAT BEST PRACTICE INDEPENDENT RE DISTINCT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES LIKE THE STATE COMMISSION SB ONE THREE NINE REQUIRES MEASURES TO MEET STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. PROVIDING RECENT CANDIDATES LOBBYISTS FOR MAJOR DONORS FROM SERVING ON THE COMMISSION. CREATES A RANDOM SELECTION PROCESSES TO ENSURE COMMISSIONERS NOVEL INTENDING FISHEL YOUR CAR'S OF THE COUNTY TAKE FROM THE STEPS TO ENSURE THE COMMISSIONERS REFLECT THE DIVERSITY THE JURISDICTION. REQUIRES A COMMISSION TACK TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENTLY EXCUSE ME AND HOLD MULTIPLE HEARINGS FORMAT CAN BE ADOPTED. INDEPENDENT REDUCING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LEADS MORE REPRESENT ABOUT COMES FROM A TRUSTED FRIENDS PROCESS FOR THAT -- I THINK YOU -- TONIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOOR ROSE. THE RIVER IS A CALIFORNIA. THE STATELY KELP LEAD THE FIGHT FOR THE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION OF THE LATE AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OUR LOCAL LEAGUES. WORK -- BOTH TO TRY TO GET INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION TO PUT THE PLACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WHEN THEY ARE. IN PLACE THEY WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION THEY WERE THERE IN THE TRENCHES THEY ARE THEY'RE MAKING SURE THE COMMISSIONERS REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS REALLY ROBUST THAT ENGAGES PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT. AND THE REASON THAT WE DO THIS IS BECAUSE FAIR INCLUSIVE LINE DRAWING IS REALLY CORD A GOOD GOVERNMENT. WAITED LEGISLATIVE BODY DRAWS ITS OWN LINE SIR IS NECESSARILY AN ALWAYS A TEMPTATION TO HELP OR HURT. INCUMBENTS ARE POTENTIAL MEMBERS OR TO PRESERVE POWER IN ONE POLITICAL PARTY THESE ARE NOT ABSTRACT CONCERNS WE'VE SEEN THEM ALL TOO OFTEN. ONE REPORT FASTER BY. I DO THAT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. BASICALLY VOTERS WANT TO KNOW THE LEXUS ARE GOING TO BE FAIR FIGHTS THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT SOMEBODY THAT REALLY REFLECTS THE INTERESTS OF THEIR COMMUNITY.

SYLVIA CHIU FOR A SPECIFIC AND MARK ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OF DRIVEN ME WITNESSES OPPOSITION. STAND HERE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GIVE THE BULLET POINT VERSION OF OUR OPPOSITION WHICH IS JUST THAT THIS IMPLEMENT THE MANDATE -- THE MANDATES WILL HAVE TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE STATE -- THE STATE HAS SO FAR -- SUSPENDED ALL OF THE OTHER ELECTION RELATED MANDATES THAT WE FEAR THAT THIS WILL MEET A SIMILAR FATE WHICH WILL IN FACT MAKE IT OPTIONAL IN LAW INSTEAD OF REQUIRED WHICH WE THINK IS. CONFUSING -- FOR THE PUBLIC IN FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THAT COUNTIES -- THREE OUT OF FOUR COUNTY STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED -- THERE THAT DESCRIBE THEIR TAX REVENUE SINCE THE RECESSION -- AND THIS WOULD JUST BE AN ADDITIONAL COST THOSE ARE. COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM WITH THE CHAIR PLEASE IDENTIFY HIMSELF OR THE WITNESSES SAID AND IF I'M SELF. TRYING TO BE BRIEF AND I WAS TOO BRIEF -- JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS ANOTHER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS AS THE SOCK ON ON FISCAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OFANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE -- SELLING MEMBER OF RICK ROSS THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S JUST A QUICK QUESTION AS FAR AS WORKING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO AGENDA IS THIS OR HAVE HEARINGS ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC WITHIN THE LOCAL JURISDICTION [inaudible] WELL THEY WHILE ON THIS ON THIS BILL. ON THIS BILL ON ON THIS PROCESS OF OF HAVING THIS PROCESS OVER THE EXISTING PROCESS HAS IT BEEN VETTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVING HEARINGS MAKING SURE THAT THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS ARE -- GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD AT THAT LEVEL WELL WE HAVE SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR IS -- WE HAVE THERE WE HAVE PASSED LAWS THAT HAVE ALLOWED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN TWO TIME SWITCH OVER TO INDEPENDENT REDUCING COMMISSIONS AND IN FACT. WE HAVE ALREADY. ARE REQUIRED LOS ANGELES. AND I THINK SAN DIEGO -- AS WELL TO DO SO SO IN THOSE AREAS -- THAT HAVE ALREADY. DONE INDEPENDENT THIS COMMISSIONS OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE BEEN CUT. PULLING TOGETHER THE PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING THESE COMMISSIONS TOGETHER AND THEN -- AND THEN HAVING TO DRAW THE LINES IN THIS WOULD END UP. THEN NOW DICTATING TO THE COUNTIES -- THE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS COMMISSION SAID SO THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED IS -- RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN I THINK COUNTIES OVER -- SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND AND THEN COUNTIES BETWEEN TWO FIFTY AND SEVENTY THOUSAND SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. AND IS ONE THING WE HAVE TO MENTION AND WE'VE TAKEN SOME AMENDS TO MAKE -- THIS PROCESS SIGNIFICAN LESS EXPENSIVE THAT HAVE BEEN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. I THINK MOST OF THE INITIAL REACTION FROM THE COUNTIES WAS THEY WORRY ABOUT EXPENSE -- BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE GRAND JURY CONTRIVING THE THE THE THE SELECTION PROCESS. FOR BUSY ADMINISTERING THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE COMMISSIONERS IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVENE A BRAND NEW BODY TO DO THAT. AND SO WHERE WHERE WE'RE BECAUSE THERE WERE CONCERNS IN YOUR COUNTERPART COMMITTEE OVER ON THE SENATE SIDE THAT THAT -- THIS MAY BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SMALLER COUNTIES WE'VE FOCUSED ON THE LARGER COUNTIES -- WHETHER BE LESS OF AN IMPACT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MUCH BIGGER BUDGETS AND THE TOTAL COST. EYES WITH AN ESTIMATE TO BE A LITTLE LESS TO A THOUSAND WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR AND THE CONCERN. THAT I HAVE IT AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE COUNTIES BEING ABLE TO AGENDA IS IT HAVE A HEARING. HERE FROM THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS ON SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD IN THIS AREA I DON'T AGREE WITH WITH. I'D I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE WHERE THE BILL IS HEADED I JUST THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE MORE. INPUT FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL MOM WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVING HEARINGS AGENDAS UNIT MAKING SURE THAT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND HAVING THAT MOVE AND BY THE WAY THAT IS ACTUALLY BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS SO SO. FOR THIS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVE TO HAVE FIVE HEARINGS OVER THE PUBLIC THERE'S A IS A VERY OPEN PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH THE SELECTION. AND THEN THE AND AND AND AND THEN COME MONITORING THEM THE MAP TRYING PROCESS THAT GOES FORWARD SO THERE'S A VERY REAL BLAST. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ASPECT TO THIS BILL BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TALK TO YOU ABOUT. BY STRENGTHENING IT IF THAT'S OF INTEREST TO YOU. SEVEN LOOK FORWARD TO FOR THE DIALOGUE OKAY. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. NO JUST VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE THE HARD WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AS THEY SAY -- THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE I'M. YEAH WE REALLY MADE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR FISCAL IMPACT ON THE ON THE COUNTIES AND WE'RE VERY VERY COMMITTED. TO A FAIR ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT MAKING SURE THE LINES ARE DRAWN IN A FAIR WAY -- AND HAVING AN INDEPENDENT GROUP DO THAT WE DO THAT VERY SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE LINES I CAN RATIONALIZE FORTY CAUSATION LINES TOWARDS VERY WELL FOR US. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FOR THE SAME FAIRNESS PRINCIPLES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING -- SUPERVISORS WITHOUT ASK FOR HAVE A GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO RING THE BELL A BILL FORD AND I AM MAKING THE EFFORT TO REDUCE REDUCE THE IMPACTS ON OUR SMALLER -- COUNTY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND SECRETARY.

IMPROVING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BUDGET ACT APPROVAL WAS GRANTED DISSOLVING THE STATE'S FOUR HUNDRED PLUS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. I VOTED AGAINST THAT DISSOLUTION WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND PROUD TO HAVE DONE THAT. THESE AGENTS THE SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT I REDEVELOPMENT PROVIDED THE LARGEST ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AS A LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES PROVIDED ROUGHLY ONE BILLION ANNUALLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHEN REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE CLOSED -- CALIFORNIA REMOVE THIS FINANCING BUT ALSO LAUGHED SOME CITIES WITH -- SOME DOLLARS IN THIS CASE GLENDALE HAD A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SUPPORT IT TAXABLE ALLOCATION BOND AND AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. OF NON HOUSING DOLLARS FROMTHE CENTRAL GLENDALE WE'RE ALL OF IT REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA THAT IT IS PREVENTED FROM UTILIZING BY THE STATE BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE DISSOLUTION. ACT TO BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO RATHER THAN DE FEES OR CANCEL THIS BOND GLENDALE HAS REQUESTED TO DELEGATE IT TOWARDS PROJECTS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE THESE DOLLARS TO BUILD UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED DEDICATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL AND SO FUNDAMENTALLY WANT TO KEEP LOCAL DOLLARS LOCAL AND GIVE THE CITY -- LOCALLY DRIVEN DISCRETION TO USE THEM EXCLUSIVELY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH ME I HAVE FILL LANDS OF FAME FROM THE GREAT CITY OF GLENDALE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS NANCY CHAD ASSISTING US ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING AND THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S GOAL TO TRY TO HELP THE CITY OF GLENDALE PRODUCE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE DIVERSION OF PROPERTY TAXES COULD HURT EDUCATION FUNDING OVER THE LONG TERM. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR A GENERAL FUND BACK FILL OF THOSE PROPERTY TAXES THAT ARE SHIFTED AWAY FROM LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN THE SHORT TERM. WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THAT THAT MECHANISM ITSELF MAKES EDUCATION -- MORE RELIABLE ON THE VOLATILE GENERAL FUND OVER THE LONGER TERM THAT RELATIVELY STABLE PROPERTY TAXES AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RISK -- DURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS LIKE FIFTY SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING DUE TO BUDGET CUTS AND PROP NINETY EIGHT SUSPENSION WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN RESTORED SO WITH CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY FORTY FIRST IN EDUCATION FUNDING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY STATE WITH PACIFIC WORKING SHIPPING ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT OCEAN KERR'S MARINE TERMINAL OPERATORS DOING BUSINESS IN THE PORT OF OAKLAND THANK YOU FOR PLANTS TO COMMENT TODAY. WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT IT ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME TYPE OF PROTECTIONS THAT EXIST IN CURRENT LAW WITH RESPECT THE F. T. I. F. THESE FOUR SEAPORT DEVELOPMENT -- WE FIND THAT TO BE A A REAL DEFICIENCY OF THE BILL BUT MAKES A WATERFRONT SO DESIRABLE TO THE A IS IS THE SAME THING THAT MAKES IT IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO PROTECT. WHICH IS A ONCE WATER FROM PROPERTY IS GONE IT'S GONE FOREVER WE CANNOT USE IT AS A PRODUCTIVE PART OF OUR WORKING WATERFRONT -- YOU'LL HEAR FROM OF THE STANDOFF MILE W. OF THAT SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF OUR WORKING WATERFRONT OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW THAT CARGO -- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THE STATE MOVES FORWARD WITH AYE IF THESE -- THEY DO IN A WAY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH SB -- SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR HOLLINGS WAS PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THAT REQUIRES THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND THE SEAPORT TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE. THAT PROVISIONS MOVING FORWARD IN AN I FD PROCESS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S TRUST. THIS AVOIDS THAT PROCESS UNNECESSARILY. IT WAS THE CITY COUNCIL IN CONTROL OF STATE PROPERTY -- WHICH IS IMPROPER AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE TRUST -- AND SO IT DOESN'T MEAN FAN THOSE PROTECTIONS IN CURRENT LAW. MORE OPPOSED TO THAT TO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR OPPORTUNITY GIVING US OFTEN THE COMMON ON THOSE THINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED SB TWO NINETY THREE FOR OF HAND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. OTHER THAN THE OTHER OPPOSITION WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE WITH ME TODAY JUST REALLY BRIEFLY MEMBERS WE ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS -- IT SHOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE BEFORE BONDS CAN BE ISSUED -- I HAVE TIAS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS IN STATUTE AND THEY'VE ALWAYS REQUIRED A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD REMAINING IN PLACE -- FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT LONG TERM DEBT THAT'S GOING TO BE ON PROPERTY TAX ROLLS FOR DECADES -- INCLUDING TAX INCREMENT SHOULD REQUIRE A HIGHER VOTER THRESHOLD AND THAT'S ALSO BECAUSE I IF HE'S ARE TRADITIONALLY NOT BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF A LOCAL GENERAL FUND. THAT'S INCREASING RISK FOR BOTH BOND HOLDERS AND TAXPAYERS AGAIN ALL THE MORE REASON WHY YOU'D WANT -- BROADER LOCAL SUPPORT AND BY OFF -- BEFORE ISSUING THESE BONDS SO FOR THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN OVER [inaudible] THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LISA AND ALL AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE. FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COUNCIL OF THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE WAREHOUSE UNION. WHICH REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST SKILLED AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BLUE COLLAR LABOR IN NORTH AMERICA. WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB TWO NINETY THREE BECAUSE IT WILL COST OAKLAND TAXPAYERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON UNNECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IN SUPPORT OF A LUXURY DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL DESTROY GOOD PAYING BLUE COLLAR JOBS THAT THE OAKLAND RESIDENTS DEPEND ON THE KANYE'S BASEBALL ORGANIZATION IS QUICK TO STATE. YES BALLPARK IN LUXURY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. PROPOSAL WILL BE PRIVATELY FINANCED BUT SB TWO NINETY THREE MAKES IT CLEAR THIS IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. THERE DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE OAKLAND TAXPAYERS TO KICK IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE. CLEAN UP A WORKING INDUSTRIAL SITE. IN AN INACCESSIBLE AND COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL AREA OF OAKLAND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT IN THEIR SUPPORT LETTER THE H. HAVE STATED THE PROJECT CANNOT BE BUILT. WITHOUT TAX INCREMENTS. TO SAY THIS PROJECT IS PRIVATELY FINANCED IGNORES THE VERY REAL AND SIGNIFICANT COST TO OAKLAND. OAKLAND NEEDS TAX DOLLARS GOING TO FUND EDUCATION FIX CRUMBLING ROADS IN SUPPORT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT HELPING BILLIONAIRES MAKE MORE MONEY FROM LUXURY HOUSING. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LUXURY DEVELOPMENT AND BALLPARK IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR WORKING PORT. WILL DISRUPT THE THRIVING MARITIME INDUSTRY THAT ARE WORKING WATERFRONT AND JEOPARDIZE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SEAPORT RELATED JOBS. THE ACE PROPOSAL WOULD TAKE AWAY CRITICAL SPACE BEING USED FOR PORT OPERATIONS AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC DELAYS. THAT WILL HINDER. THE CONTINUED FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PORT. SEAPORT ACTIVITY AT THE PORT SUPPORTS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN DIRECT WAGES AND SALARY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. THAT SUPPORT THE LIVELIHOOD OF MANY BAY AREA RESIDENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE MARITIME INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED ITSELF TO CONTRIBUTE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION TO THE PORTS OPERATING REVENUE. THOSE THAT WORK AT THE PORT EVERY DAY HAVE SAID LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THIS PROJECT PUTS NOT JUST THEIR JOBS IN JEOPARDY BUT THE VIABILITY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PORT. IN ON ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PORTS ON THE WEST COAST AGAIN. THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT DEAL PURE AND SIMPLE IT INVOLVES A VALUABLE REAL ESTATE AND LUXURY CONDOS. WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO. WITH THE KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT OAKLAND H.. WE RESPECT SICKLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE OUR CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION AND VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ARE THERE ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES TO OPPOSE THANK YOU YES MY NAME IS NOT A MAKE A THE PRESIDENT OF I'LL W. BUT WE CAN. ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SDDC NOR THE COVERAGES ARE COUNCIL AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. REASON ONE WE DON'T GET IN WILL WATERFRONT LAND OKAY FOR LAST THREE YEARS. WE WILL MORE CARGO IN THE HISTORY ABOUT IT BI&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; OKAY WE'RE TRYING TO GROW. THIS WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE LABOR. WHEN YOU BUILD HOUSES AND INDUSTRIAL LAND? THEY WILL CRY LIKE HILL. WE'RE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE WE WORK THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR TO GET THIS CARGO IN AND OUT OF OAKLAND. AND WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M AARON RIGHT I'LL W. LOCAL TEN BUSINESS STAGING REPRESENTING. THOUSAND WORKERS LONG SO WORKERS BUT ALSO HERE SPEAKING FOR THE TRUCKERS THE RAILROADS. AND GREATER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY LIKE AGRICULTURE THE MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL BECAUSE OAKLAND CALIFORNIA IS THE THIRD LARGEST PORT IN THE WEST COAST. AND WE NEED TO KEEP IT THAT WAY HOWARD TERMINAL. IS A KEY LOCATION THEY WANT TO PUT OF STADIUM SMACK DAB WHERE RAY RHODES RUN THROUGH WELL WE HAVE A TURNING BASIN FOR SHIPS. AND THE TRUCKERS HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH THERE. YOU BUILD OF STADIUM RIGHT HERE IT'S GOING TO CHOKE OFF THE PORT. MINIMIZE OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND SHIPPERS WILL LEAVE WHEN THE SHIPPERS LEAVE. AND THIS WHOLE IDEA. SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. DO YOU WANT. TO SHIP TO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH CALIFORNIA OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. OR DO I NEED TO SEND MY CARGO ELSEWHERE SEATTLE ALONG LOS ANGELES AGAIN RESPECTIVELY THANK YOU. AND FOR THE TIME AND PLEASE VOTE NO. THANK YOU. MARIN PM WE HAVE A NATIONAL LONG TERM WHERE HOUSE UNION -- AND OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY -- ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES. YES -- THANK YOU FOR THIS ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS -- DURING MY GRADUATE WORK IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AT A WHOLE PUBLIC POLICY COURSE ON STADIUMS AND THE IMPACT -- IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE RELEVANT UNTIL TODAY -- I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY YOU'RE SEEKING TO AVOID THE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL WITH AN I FD GENERALLY IT ALWAYS HAS HAD. THE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL I KNOW NOT MANY PEOPLE MAKE THAT THRESHOLD COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. I AM CERTAINLY THIS IS -- IT REMOVES THE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL BUT IT DOES INCLUDE MULTIPLE PUBLIC HEARINGS IN A PROTEST PROCESS -- CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN WITH PREVIOUS BILLS THAT HAVE -- PASSED THE PROTEST LANGUAGE ONLY REQUIRES A 25% TO FILE AND THEN IT DOES GO TO THE BALLOT -- THIS. THIS WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST. I'M THE I FD TO HAVE REMOVED THAT TWO THIRDS -- BUT IT SB NINE SIXTY ONE SENATOR ALLEN'S BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS CHAPTER IT IS NOW IN EFFECT DID THAT -- BUT IT'S MOSTLY TO BE BROAD PLANT IS THERE. ARE VERY FEW RESIDENTS NOW. BUDGET USUALLY THE I HAVE TO USE THE RESIDENTS AROUND IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. AND WHILE THERE ARE SOME RESIDENTS IN FACT ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS HERE IS IN THAT SIR IT IS THERE'S VERY LITTLE HOUSING THERE NOW SO THERE'S VERY FEW RESIDENTS AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES SO REMEMBER VOEPEL. IN. THIS QUESTION MAY BE A BETTER DIRECTED AT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EIGHTIES. WHY BUILD A NEW STADIUM IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION WHY NOT JUST REDO YOUR STADIUM? WHERE IT'S AT? WELL IF YOU LOOK ACROSS -- NORTH AMERICA THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MAJOR LEAGUE STADIUMS ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT BEEN PRIVATELY FINANCED OR BUILT IN DOWNTOWN URBAN LOCATIONS. AND THIS IS DOWNTOWN LOCATION IN THE DOWNTOWN URBAN CORE OF OAKLAND AS OPPOSED TO OUR CURRENT SITE WHICH IS SIX MILES SOUTH IN MORE OF A QUIET SIGH INDUSTRIAL SUBURBAN LOCATION AND SO. A LOCATION WHERE YOU CAN WALK BIKE AND ACTUALLY GET TO AND FROM THE LOCATION -- THAT WAY IS ACTUALLY LEAD TO MORE SUCCESS AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY REASONS AND IT BRINGS WITH IT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. TO THE SURROUNDING AREA AND THE DOWNTOWN CORE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY. SO THE THINKING HE REASONS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION. THE MOTION STILL -- WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS. AND A SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. OKAY -- REJECT CLOSE. I'M I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I WOULD ONLY INDICATE THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND OF THE STADIUM -- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS BY OUR UNION MEMBERS THAT SPOKE. AND SOME OTHER PORT AFFILIATES THAT OF SPOKE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT MAY IMPACT PORT OF OPERATIONS -- WHILE I CANNOT TELL YOU WITH ALL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACTS IMPORT OPERATION CERTAINLY I LEAVE IT. TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND ITSELF TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND IT IS THEIR DETERMINATION THAT ENHANCES AND THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
