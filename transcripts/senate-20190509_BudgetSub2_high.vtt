REPORT AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.038
KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

CONSIDERATION I'M IN THE

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.208
INTEREST OF TIME AND GIVEN THE

COMMITTEES -- EXTENSIVE

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:24.911
FAMILIARITY WITH THIS PROJECT

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:25.444
I'M GONNA SKIP OVER THE

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.080
BACKGROUND I'M AND JUMP RIGHT TO

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:31.517
PAGE SEVEN IF THAT -- THAT'S

ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.387
I'M THAT WE IDENTIFIED THE KEY

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:35.021
FEATURES OF THE PROJECT UPDATE

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.122
REPORT AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.491
AUTHORITY -- AT AGE TWENTY SOME

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:39.859
REYES AND BRIEFLY AS WELL ON THE

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:41.294
FIRST IS IT REALLY CHANGES THE

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.062
FOCUS OF THE PROJECT AND IT

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.430
CHANGES THE FOCUS TYPE.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:47.967
OF TUMOR SAID TO BAKERSFIELD.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.168
YES -- THE PREVIOUS PLAN FOCUS

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.403
MORE ON THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.237
SEGMENT WHICH WAS A SMALLER

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.505
SEGMENT BETWEEN MADERA AND

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.073
CHAPTER.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.709
THE PLAN ALSO PROPOSES TO BEGIN

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.244
INTERIM FIVE SERVICES INTERIM

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.079
HIGH SPEED SERVICES ON THAT

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:00.613
MERCED.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.481
FIELD LINE OF THE PREVIOUS PLAN

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.550
A PROPOSED INTERIM SERVICES

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:05.985
POTENTIALLY STARTING I'M SAN

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.987
FRANCISCO TO GILROY AS WELL AS

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:08.554
ON THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:09.822
SEGMENT.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.057
I'M SECONDS ARE THE PLAN

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.358
INCORPORATES FEEDBACK FROM THIS

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.392
EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WHICH WAS

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:16.696
REFERENCE -- SO BASICALLY -- AS

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.565
PART OF THE AUTHORITIES WORK I

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.867
THEY CHARGE THAT REALLY TRAIN

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:21.901
OPERATOR WITH LOOKING AT

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.269
PROVIDING POTENTIAL INTERIM

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.071
SERVICES ON EITHER THAT SAN

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.106
FRANCISCO TO GILROY LINE OR THIS

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.741
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD LINE AND

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:29.675
BASED ON A VARIETY OF

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.043
ASSUMPTIONS AND THOSE INCLUDED

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.378
ON THE COMPLETION OF A RIGHT IF.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.747
CAPITAL PROJECTS AS WELL AS

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.315
ESTABLISHING VERY INTEGRATED A

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:37.850
SERVICE WITH EXISTING REAL

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.518
PROVIDERS SUCH AS AMTRAK AND THE

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.921
EAST CORRIDOR -- EVERY THE ACE

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.356
SERVICE I GIVEN THOSE

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.658
ASSUMPTIONS THEY FOUND THAT THE

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.928
OPTIMAL SERVICE WAS TO DO MERCED

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.496
TO BAKERSFIELD.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.864
I NEXT THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.199
REFLECTS HIGHER COST ESTIMATES

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.767
THAT WE SAW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.736
AND EIGHTEEN I SPECIFICALLY THE

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.104
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ESTIMATES

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.272
THE BASELINE COST OF

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:00.506
CONSTRUCTING THAT INITIAL

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.607
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.109
I TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:04.477
DOLLARS THIS IS A ONE POINT

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.212
EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.114
VERSUS THE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.349
EIGHTEEN ESTIMATE -- THERE ARE A

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:10.983
FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.185
THE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS AN

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.221
ADJUSTMENT TO THE CONTINGENCY.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.322
AND THE REASON WHY THEY ARE

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.990
ADJUSTING WAS CONTINGENCY IS

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:18.858
BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING A NEW

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:19.926
APPROACH TO SETTING THE

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.193
CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS SO BASICALLY

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.029
THE CONTINGENCY IS IS SUPPOSED

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:24.096
TO BE SET SUCH THAT.

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.364
I'M IN THERE TO GIVE US A LITTLE

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.199
BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM -- BECAUSE

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:28.467
THERE'S SOME UNKNOWNS IN IN

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.636
CONSTRUCTING SUCH A PROJECT THE

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.404
PREVIOUSLY THE WAY THAT THEY

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.905
WERE ESTABLISHING THAT

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.974
CONTINGENCY WAS -- TO WAS SUCH

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:35.908
THAT.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:37.410
IF YOU ADDED THE CONTINGENCY AND

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.644
YOU CREATED THIS BASE I BUDGET

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:39.478
THE BASELINE.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:43.049
BUDGET THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.984
A 10% CHANCE THAT.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:45.318
FIND BUDGET.

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.086
I'M AND SO IT 90% CHANCE THAT

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.587
YOU WOULD GO OVER THAT BASELINE

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.523
BUDGET US THEIR REVISING THAT

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:51.090
APPROACH AND NOW THEY ARE.

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.725
BASICALLY TAKING THE APPROACH

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.360
FOR THIS SMALL THIS PORTION OF

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.695
THE LINE A SETTING THAT BE

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:56.929
SIGNED BUDGET SUCH THAT THERE'S

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.564
A 70% CHANCE THAT WE'LL STAY

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.966
WITHIN THAT BASELINE BUDGET

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.300
RATHER THAN A 10% CHANCE.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:04.070
AND ONLY A 30% CHANCE WILL GO

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:04.704
OVER THAT THAT'S BASED ON THEIR

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.504
MODELING.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:06.539
I'M THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:07.740
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.308
COST INCREASE INCLUDING SCOPE

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.043
CHANGES AND SOME COST INCREASES.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.878
I'M NEXT IT'S NOTABLE THAT THEY

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.081
DON'T PROVIDE THE COST ESTIMATES

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.149
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT --

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.718
SO THERE'S SOME PORTIONS THAT%

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.286
THEY HAVEN'T WE LOOKED AT SINCE

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.954
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.622
AND I THEY ALSO IDENTIFY FUNDING

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.191
SORT FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.559
SOURCES THE COMMITTEES I THINK

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.461
I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THESE

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.962
INCLUDE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS.

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:30.830
ON THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATION

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.298
OF THOSE FUNDS I'M THERE'S

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:33.799
FEDERAL FIND THREE POINT FIVE

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.634
BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS -- AND

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.570
THERE'S ALSO PROP ONE A WHICH IS

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:38.771
A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:39.772
FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.707
I BASED ON SOME ASSUMPTIONS ON

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.676
CAP AND TRADE REVENUES -- THEY

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.211
THEY ESTIMATE THAT THEY HAVE

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.179
TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION TO

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:47.813
TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.482
AVAILABLE -- THEY ASKED ME THIS

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.783
IS SUFFICIENT TO DO THAT MERCED

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.518
TO BAKERSFIELD LINE AS WELL AS

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:53.953
TO DO THE OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.587
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:57.890
PROJECTS PURCHASE TRAINS.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.925
ON THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.261
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. NINE

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.863
NINE YOU'LL SEE A FIGURE THAT

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.831
OUT LAYS OUT BOTH THE FINDING AS

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:06.732
WELL AS THE COST FOR THE PROJECT

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:07.033
[inaudible]

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.934
I'M.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.669
SO NEXT THE STM AVAILABILITY

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.904
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PHASE ONE

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.339
SO BASICALLY THEY THEY ASSUME

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.306
THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY TO

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.408
COMPLETE THAT MERCED TO

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.442
BAKERSFIELD MINE IN THOSE

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.843
ASSOCIATED COMMITMENTS -- BUT

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.980
THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:21.614
IDENTIFICATION OF FUNDING BEYOND

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.349
THAT.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.251
I SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN AND

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:26.419
WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY ISSUES

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:27.219
FROM FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:28.988
CONSIDERATION THAT THAT FOLLOW

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.823
FROM THOSE THOSE -- KEY ASPECTS

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.124
OF THE PLAN.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.826
THE FIRST IS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.027
THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERIM

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.262
SERVICE DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.797
FACTORS.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.231
SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.733
EARLY TRAIN OPERATORS MODELING

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.068
REALLY ASSUME THE NUMBER OF

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.436
THINGS THAT ASSUME THINGS ABOUT

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:44.537
WHAT CAPITAL PROJECTS WOULD BE

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:44.870
BUILT.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.472
ABOUT SERVE HOW THE OPERATIONS

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.674
WOULD BE COORDINATED SO THAT

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.109
THEY WOULD INCREASE RIDERSHIP --

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.478
SO IF THOSE DON'T COME TO PASS

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.112
THEN WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.381
REVENUES AND AT THE RIDERSHIP UP

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.550
MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE THE WAY

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:58.517
THAT THEY EXPECT.

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.685
THE SECOND MAJOR ISSUE FOR

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.719
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:01.654
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.989
ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS A CITY WITH

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.324
THIS PROJECT COULD BE HIGHER.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.259
SOME OF THAT IS JUST INTRINSIC

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.561
TO DOING A MEGA PROJECT THERE'S

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.129
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE ON

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.230
THERE ALSO SOME SPECIFIC

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:12.765
UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THIS

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.733
PROJECTS PARTLY -- SHOULD

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.634
FUNDING THAT MATERIALIZE

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.236
SCHEDULES GET PUSHED BACK WE

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:18.404
WOULD EXPECT THAT WOULD HAVE

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.772
SOME COST IMPLICATIONS.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:20.773
I'M AND ADDITIONALLY AS I

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.842
MENTIONED THEY TOOK THIS REVISED

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:23.742
BUDGETING APPROACH WERE NOW

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.311
THEY'RE TAKING A LESS AGGRESSIVE

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:26.412
APPROACH TO SETTING THAT

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.147
BASELINE BUDGET -- WE THINK THAT

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:29.281
MAKES SENSE BUT THEY'RE ONLY

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:30.683
DOING THAT FOR A SEGMENT O THE

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.351
PROJECT THEY HAVEN'T -- APPLIED

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.319
THAT.

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.920
MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.856
THE ENTIRE PROJECT -- IF THEY

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:37.957
DID WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.025
ENTIRE PROJECTS COST WOULD ALSO

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.861
INCREASED AND SO WE PROBABLY BE

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.662
LOOKING AT SOMETHING BEYOND THE

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.698
SEVENTY NINE POINT ONE BILLION --

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.666
THAT.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:48.968
IS IDENTIFIED IN A PLAN.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:49.835
THIRD IT'S UNCLEAR IF THEY'RE

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:51.270
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.305
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD A PART OF

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:55.574
THIS IS BECAUSE COST INCREASES

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.409
COULD OCCUR ON THAT SEGMENT ALSO

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.844
SOME OF THE REVENUES MIGHT NOT

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.646
MATERIALIZE SO POTENTIALLY THE

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.047
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD RESEND

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.616
THAT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION OR

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:04.884
PORTION OF THAT THREE POINT.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.585
FIVE BILLION I'M AS THEY HAVE

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.354
THREATENED TO DO I UNCLEAR AT

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.054
THIS TIME WHETHER THAT WILL

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.189
OCCUR THERE'S ALSO SOME

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.258
UNCERTAINTY -- NATURALLY WITH

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:13.726
CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AND SO

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.294
I'M SHOULD DOES NOT MATERIALIZE

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.129
THE WAY THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.764
THAT WOULD BE ALSO A RISK THERE.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:22.001
ON IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ELEVEN WE

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.602
CONTINUE WITH OUR ISSUES FOR

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:25.437
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- THE

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:26.906
NEXT ONE IS THAT THERE'S NO

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.641
FUNDING PLAN BE BEYOND MERCED TO

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.209
BAKERSFIELD SO AS I MENTIONED

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.211
I'M REALLY THEY THEY FOCUS ON

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.445
FINDING THAT THAT MERCED

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:34.680
BAKERSFIELD LINE THEY THEY

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.148
ESTIMATE THEY'LL DO THAT BUT

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.117
IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR HOW WE WOULD

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.485
FIND THE REST OF THE PROJECT.

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.253
AND SO IT LIKELY THE GENERAL

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.389
FUND WOULD HAVE TO OR SOME OTHER

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:44.590
SIMILAR SOURCE WOULD HAVE TO

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.792
COVER A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.227
COSTS.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.663
ON THE NEXT ISSUE I TO HIGHLIGHT

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:51.964
HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.365
DOES HAVE OTHER OPTIONS FOR

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:55.234
MOVING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.702
THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.204
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP BACK

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:58.938
YOU GIVEN THEY WERE CHANGING

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.806
DIRECTION GIVEN THAT THERE IS

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:01.974
THIS FUNDING GAP.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.409
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:04.877
ARE HOW IT WANTS TO PROCEED WITH

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.612
THE PROJECT -- AND REALLY

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.047
EVALUATE THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.049
THAT ARE NOT FULLY EVALUATED IN

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.750
THE IN THE PLAN HERE ON THERE

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:14.086
REALLY A WHOLE RANGE OF OF

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:14.753
POTENTIAL OPTIONS THAT COULD BE

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.888
CONSIDERED.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.723
WE COULD DO A SMALLER SEGMENT WE

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.258
COULD DO A BIGGER SEGMENT -- WE

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.727
COULD DO YOU -- CONVENTIONAL

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.963
DIESEL SERVICE WE COULD DO

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.064
ELECTRIFIED SERVICE THAT WAS

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.732
LESS HIGH SPEED THERE'S A WHOLE

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.000
RANGE ON THEIR PUBLIC TRADEOFFS

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.602
ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THOSE

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:30.336
APPROACHES.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:31.237
I'M SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:32.738
THINGS LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:35.374
CONSIDER AND AT CONSIDER.

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.177
DISCUSSING WITH THE AUTHORITY

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:39.245
THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.346
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE LAST

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.513
ISSUE THAT FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.882
CONSIDERATION STARTS ON PAGE

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.217
TWELVE I'M WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.018
CONSIDERATIONS OF THE

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.019
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO TAKE

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.988
KEEP IN MIND AS IT EVALUATES.

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.589
ANY AND ALL OF THOSE POTENTIAL

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.725
OPTIONS.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.026
THE FIRST IS COST FOR THAT

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:55.227
INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AS

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.996
I INDICATED -- IS ESTIMATED TO

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.364
COST TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.099
AT THIS TIME EXTENSIONS TO

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.634
MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD IF YOU

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.168
COMBINE THOSE ARE ALMOST ADD

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.271
ALMOST ANOTHER FOUR BILLION TO

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.305
THE PROJECT.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:07.406
I'M SUIT THE LEGISLATURE WHEN I

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:08.741
THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT COSTS

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.142
OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.310
ON THE NEXT TO ISSUE AS

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.445
TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS SO AGAIN

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.781
IT'S LOOKING AT OKAY WELL FOR

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:17.182
EXAMPLE NOT FOR THOSE EXTENSIONS.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.450
CLEARLY THE PROVIDE SOME

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:18.984
ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.753
BENEFITS ARE THEY SUFFICIENT TO

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.187
JUSTIFY ANOTHER FOR YOU KNOW FOR

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:23.289
BILLION DOLLARS AS OF THE KINDS

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.924
OF QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:26.859
GONNA WANT TO WRESTLE WITH.

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:27.526
THE NEXT ISSUE IS THE EFFECT ON

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.994
LOCAL COMMUNITIES SO BOTH THE

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.529
CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS ON THERE

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.430
SOME DISRUPTION TO LOCAL

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:33.098
COMMUNITIES IN MANY CASES AS

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.633
WELL AS SOME ECONOMIC.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.001
BENEFITS FROM THE ADDITIONAL

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:37.436
JOBS SO ARE SOME TRADE OFFS

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.937
THERE AND AND THE DIFFERENT

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:39.505
OPTIONS WILL PROBABLY HAVE

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:42.541
DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT THINGS TO

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.642
CONSIDER IN THAT RESPECT AS WELL.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:44.877
AND THEN FINALLY RISKS AND

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:46.879
UNCERTAINTIES THESE ARE -- ALSO

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.380
IDENTIFIED IN YOUR AGENDA REALLY

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.249
WELL -- BUT THERE VARIETY OF

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:50.783
DIFFERENT RISKS AND

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.284
UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH A

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.219
DIFFERENT OPTIONS INCLUDE

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.654
POTENTIAL AND DIFFERENCES AND

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:56.422
THE AMOUNT OF RISK.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:58.791
CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES.

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.859
THE MORE I AMBITIOUS THE PROJECT

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:01.527
FOR EXAMPLE PROBABLY HAVE MORE

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.462
OF THOSE -- WRISTS OF COST

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.331
INCREASES AND ALSO COORDINATION

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.799
WITH REAL PROVIDERS AND OTHER

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:07.733
PROVIDERS ARE PROBABLY SOME

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.301
RISKS THERE AND THEN COMPLIANCE

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.669
WITH PROPOSITION ONE A AND

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.171
FEDERAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:13.372
REALLY SOME KEY RISKS AND

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.873
UNCERTAINTIES THAT THE

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.475
LEGISLATURE PROBABLY HAVE TO WAY.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:17.876
AS IT LOOKS SET ON THE

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.144
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED APPROACHING

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.579
WAYS IT AGAINST OTHER OPTIONS

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.382
THAT ARE AVAILABLE HAPPY TO TAKE

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:25.851
ANY QUESTIONS.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.319
MEMBERS ARE.

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.088
QUESTIONS I DID HAVE A QUESTION

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.923
FOR THE YEAR EARLY TRAIN

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:33.092
OPERATOR SECTOR UNITS IF YOU CAN

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.095
INVITE THEM UP HERE --

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:52.344
SPECIFICALLY

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:53.312
.

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.214
SO MY QUESTION WAS -- STEP TWO

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.883
QUESTIONS ONE WAS ON THE

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.685
CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION OF THE

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:03.155
PENINSULA WHEN THAT IS COMPLETED

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.691
THE ELECTRIFICATION WHICH SHOULD

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:07.993
BE BEFORE.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.527
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT Z. IF

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:09.361
EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT.

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.997
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO RUN TESTS

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:14.800
TRAINS ON THAT ON THAT SEGMENT

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.402
OF TO DETERMINE.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.037
THE MAXIMUM SPEED THAT YOU COULD

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.672
TRAVEL FROM.

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.875
FRANCISCO TO YOUR DANCE STATION

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:27.613
LET'S JUST PUT IT THERE.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.281
SO I SPECIFIC IN THE SECTION OF

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.216
THE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST SO

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.017
IT'S A MY NAME IS HOLD HIM FOR

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:32.418
YEARS.

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:35.120
I AM THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF THE

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:36.855
ALLEY TURN A PLATE.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.424
CHAU TALKING ABOUT THE SPEED IN

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.526
THE SECTION ON SINCE WE HAVE OLD

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.528
SCHOOL ALL THE THE CROSSINGS AND

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:43.262
AND WE HAVE ALL THESE

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.130
RESTRICTION IN THESE HIGHLY THEN

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:46.298
SEE AT THESE HIGH ALLEY

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.367
POPULATED THE SECTION.

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.536
ON SO THE SPEED THAT WE CAN

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.070
ACHIEVE WILL NOT BE VERY

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.472
DIFFERENT TO THE SPEED THAT

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.474
CALTRAIN WILL ACHIEVE WHEN

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.575
EVERYTHING IS ELECTRIFIED.

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:57.309
SO WE ARE TALKING THAT THE IN

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.677
THE SECTION WE COULD POTENTIALLY

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.346
CHIEF. ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILES

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.347
PER HOUR.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.682
RIGHT IN OF THESE ANSWER THE

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.785
QUESTIONS AND OKAY ECUSA THAN

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:07.653
THE COULD THE QUESTION IS IS

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.655
THAT WOULD YOU RUN.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.724
HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS DURING

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:14.460
THIS EARLY PERIOD IS A AGAIN THE

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.794
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT GONNA

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:17.463
STOP AT EVERY STOP SO THE SOME

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:19.097
COORDINATION THAT WOULD HAVE TO

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.999
OCCUR WERE EVERYTHING WOULD DROP

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.167
DOWN AND IT WOULD GO FROM.

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:23.969
HERE DOWN TO I GUESS THE AIRPORT

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.103
RIGHT.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.371
THIS IS THE FIRST DURING THESE

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.041
AREA IN THE STUDY WE ASSUME THAT

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:29.741
THE HIGHEST PAID SERVICE WILL

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:30.175
STOP.

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.410
I WILL HAVE A SERVICE ONLY FOR

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:37.449
STATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.017
STUDY.

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.552
SO WE ASSUME THAT HE WILL STOP

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.787
IN DELIVERY.

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.755
IN ASH SAN JOSE.

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:46.191
BREAK.

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:48.694
KING IN THESE FOUR STATIONS. TO

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.862
THE SEE WHAT WE ARE STREAMING TO

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:50.896
STAND THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:51.797
TEAMS WE ARE CHATTING THE

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:53.699
CORRIDOR WITH DICK CALTRAIN --

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:53.999
TO TRAINS.

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:56.201
SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHIEF --

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.103
TAKE HIRES PIZZA IN THE SECTION

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.805
THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:00.639
AN EVEN THAT THE WHAT TRAINS

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:03.075
WOULD BE FOSTER IN THIS CASE.

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:05.410
I AM WHEN WE DID THE ANALYSIS ON

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.913
TO FIND OUT IF IT MAKES SENSE TO

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.182
DO ADDERLEY OPERATIONS IN THE

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.650
PENINSULA.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.785
WEED OUT THE CONNECTION THROUGH

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:15.187
THE PROJECT COLA TO THE

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:19.525
PARTICULAR PLACE TO THAT TO THE

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:20.559
HIGHEST BEAT.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:21.927
WE FOUND OUT THAT TERM OUR

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.762
SERVICE CAN NO IT'S REALLY BE

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:27.232
VERY DIFFERENT FROM DOES SERVICE.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:30.636
CALTRAIN WILL HAVE IN A IN.

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:31.670
WE ASSUME THAT WE ASSUME THAT WE

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:32.604
COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN THE

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.705
SERVICING TWENTY TWENTY A. FOR

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:34.373
THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.108
SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REALLY

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:37.609
DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE SERVICE

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.411
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WITHOUT

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:41.780
HAVING THE CONNECTION TO THEM.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.582
TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO MORE

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:45.784
OR LESS FOR YOUR FOR YOUR

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.687
INFORMATION AROUND 12% OF THE

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.189
PASSENGERS WHICH ARE WILLING TO

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.624
TRAVEL IN THE PENINSULA.

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.026
FROM ALL THE ALL THE PASSENGERS

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:55.928
ONLY A 112% ARE WILLING TO

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:57.930
TRAVEL BETWEEN THESE FOUR

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:58.463
STATIONS.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.665
SO THE IMPACT THAT WE CAN

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.167
CREATING THESE IN THE SECTION.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.104
IT'S NOT A IS NOT SO BIG THAT

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.973
MAKE IT SAYS.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.441
I MEAN THAT WE CAN REALLY MAKE

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:11.009
SENSE TO A TO A STAR SOMETHING

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.511
BEFORE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE BODY

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.046

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:40.906
THOSE ARE AVERAGE DESCRIBED AS

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:42.841
POSITIVE -- WE DO HAVE A SOME

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:44.809
WAYS TO GO BUT AGAIN -- THAT

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:45.977
THEY'RE THEY'RE OPEN TO THOSE

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.013
DISCUSSIONS NOW AND WE'RE HAVING

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.481
DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN.

00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:52.250
JUST AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.585
SOUTH AND CLEAR COUNTY.

00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:54.552
THERE'S HI PUBLIC INTEREST RATE

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:56.054
IN.

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:58.356
IN A MORE IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE

00:25:58.423 --> 00:26:01.326
BENEFITS TO RESIDENTS OF SANTA

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.827
CLARA COUNTY SO I JUST.

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.063
HOPE YOU'LL KEEP US POSTED OF

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.265
PROGRESS ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.200
AND WANTING TO SELL A HAVE YOU

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.535
LOOKED AT THAT AT ALL THE

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.370
ELECTRIFICATION FROM SAN JOSE TO

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.438
GILROY.

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:15.640
WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IN DETAIL --

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:17.208
CERTAINLY AS WAS NOTED THAT'S

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:18.543
NOT CURRENTLY A FOCUS THAT WE

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.278
THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:21.780
THAT WOULD BE.

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.248
APPROPRIATE AS AN OPTION I MEAN

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.317
CLEARLY YOU COULD -- YOU COULD

00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:27.552
CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANTED.

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.254
TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE PROJECT --

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.288
WHETHER YOU WANTED TO INCLUDE

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:31.756
FOR THEIR WORK NORTH ON IN THE

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:34.159
BAY AREA -- OR IF YOU SPEND LESS

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.327
MONEY ON THIS PROJECT THAT WOULD

00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:36.628
FREE UP MONEY YOU KNOW TO DO

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.129
OTHER KINDS OF REGIONAL PROJECTS

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:40.498
SO -- WE HAVEN'T DONE A AND IN

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.133
AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS AT THIS

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.134
TIME BUT WE THINK THAT'S THE

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:47.005
KIND OF KIND OF CHOICE THAT THE

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.373
LEGISLATURE SPACING.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.240

ELECTRIFICATION.

00:26:50.508 --> 00:26:52.477
AND FRANCISCO TO SANTA IS A THAT

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:55.080

VOTERS SUPPORTED NIGHT I DON'T

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.552
THINK THERE'S BEEN NECESSARILY.

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:02.454
GOOD PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT THAT

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.422
IS ONE OF THE IMMEDIATE BENEFITS

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.358
BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY INTO

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:08.393
CONSUMER -- COMMUTER.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.762
RAIL SERVICE OF THE HIGH SPEED

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:13.331
RAIL BOND -- I THINK.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:14.366
PEOPLE SHOULD BE REMINDED OF

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:17.102
THAT AT EVERY POSSIBLE TURN

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.770
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

EAST BAY THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:26.945
THE RAILROADS ARE IN.

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.881
DISCUSSIONS REGARDING ACCESS TO

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.349
FROM THE PORT THROUGH THE I

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.284
GUESS THE WHERE THE ACE TRAVELS

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:36.187
AND THEN GOING DOWN TO SAN JOSE.

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.922
ACROSS THERE SO AT LEAST THE

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.657
RAILROAD FOLKS ARE AT THE TABLE

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:41.926
WHICH CANNOT ALWAYS BE SAID THAT

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:43.361
BOX WAS GOING ON TO BE

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:44.729
INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT SAID

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:47.198
THAT CORRIDOR CONTINUES DOWN TO

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:47.432

YOU'RE AT THE TABLE THAT'S THOSE

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:56.875
DISCUSSIONS ARE.

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:59.944
MAKES SENSE CENTER STERN

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:00.245
[inaudible]

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:03.948

BEFORE US -- ANY LA -- I WANTED

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.896
TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT ON SOME

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.831
OF THE ISSUES RAISED AROUND.

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:21.599
THE LACK OF A FUNDING PLAN.

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:24.436
ON ANYTHING BEYOND MERCED THE

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.504
BAKERSFIELD HERE AND WHAT YOU

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:30.341
SORT OF SEE IS THE FUTURE -- NO

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:31.409
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I KNOW

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:34.212
I'M ON A ON A COMMITTEE WITH

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.982
MOSTLY MY FRIENDS FROM THE NORTH --

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:38.817
BUT THE BULK OF THE VEHICLE

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.752
MILES TRAVELED IN THIS STATE IN

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.187
THE BOOK OF THE TRAFFIC.

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.155
WE KNOW WHERE IT IS AND TERMS OF

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.790
DISPLACING VEHICLE TRIPS IN THIS

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.959
STATE THE CORRIDORS THAT ARE

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:49.427
ANTICIPATED FOR THAT SOUTHERN.

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.796
BOOK AND HAVE HUGE VMT

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.631
DISPLACEMENT VALUE SO I'M TRYING

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.066
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:56.234
STRATEGICALLY HOW DID YOU GUYS

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:59.070
LAND ON THIS SEGMENT.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.606
WAS IT IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.608
METRIC THAT STARTED DROVE IT WAS

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.410
THERE WAS THERE A METRIC THE

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:07.245
TROUBLE AT ALL WANT TO GET YOUR

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.446
FIRST THOUGHTS ON THAT.

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:10.882
BUT IN IN TERMS OF THE SOUTHERN

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.317
CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS REVISED

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:13.418
TODAY I THINK THE STATE'S ALWAYS

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.719
APPROACH THESE NOT AS AN EITHER

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:17.088
OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL OR

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.656
COMMUTER RAIL AND INTERCITY RAIL

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.091
INVESTMENTS BUT BOTH.

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.326
AND OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THAT

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:23.962
THE CAP AND TRADE IN THE SP.

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:25.763
ONE AND HIGH SPEED RAIL BOOKENDS

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.665
AND MONEY ANOTHER FINDING

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:29.200
THERE'S ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.368
BILLION.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.537
IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAIL

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.873
INVESTMENT SINCE.

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:35.940
TWENTY TWELVE SO HAPPY THAT YOU

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:37.342
KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.010
INVESTMENTS DOWN THERE AS WELL

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.812
AS FAR AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.947
ANALYSIS -- THE BOARDED CHOSEN

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:45.550
THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AS THE BEST

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.051
APPROACH TO GETTING HIGH SPEED

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.653
RAIL UP AND RUNNING.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.888
AND THEN THIS ANALYSIS THAT THE

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.123
GAO DID WAS FOCUSED WITHIN THAT

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.759
FRAMEWORK OF LOOKING AT THOSE

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.461
TWO ENDS OF VALLEY TO VALLEY AND

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:58.563
DETERMINING WHERE'S IN A ROOM

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.631
SERVICE.

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:01.833
WE'RE WITH THAT AT BEST BENEFIT

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.534
TO STATE.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.536
SO GETTING UP AND RUNNING THAT

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.337
WAS THE GOAL TO GET LIKE WHAT'S

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.639
THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET YOU SET

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:08.606
UP AND RUNNING.

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:10.141
YES HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.743
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S WHERE THE

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:14.479
TRAINS CAN GO THE THE FASTEST --

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:15.280
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THAT THE

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:17.215
SPEED THAT'S DEMANDED WITH PROP

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.616
ONE A WERE YOU ACHIEVE THOSE

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:19.851
HIGHER SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THAT

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.452
THE FLAT AREAS WITH A LOT OF

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:23.054
RURAL AREAS THAT THE TRAINS

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.155
GOING THROUGH BUT NOT

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.057
NECESSARILY A V. M. T. DRIVEN

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:28.593
ANALYSIS OR AT A DAILY TRIPS.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:34.098
DISPLACEMENT OR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:35.166
METRIC FOR ABOUT.

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:35.800
THE SPEED AT WHICH YOU CAN GET

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.368
TO HIGH SPEED.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.203
WELL I GUESS MULTIPLE

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:39.237
CONSIDERATIONS NOT JUST ONE BUT

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:42.207
CERTAINLY AT LOOKING AT THE AT

00:30:42.273 --> 00:30:44.175
THE AT AN INSULAR VERSES THE

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:45.510
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.245
THE CHEETOS ANALYSIS WOULD COVER

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:48.346
SOME OF THOSE ITEMS YOU MENTION

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.381
YOU KNOWS RIDERSHIP WHAT'S THE

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.749
RIDERSHIP GAIN.

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.084
YOU KNOW THAT GETS TO YOUR V. M.

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.452
T. ISSUE A BED YOU KNOW HOW MANY

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.020
NEW WRITERS ARE YOU BRINGING N

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.255
TO RAIL.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:31:00.692
HAS ALSO THE EMPHASIS ON  AS A

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.927
SEGMENT THAT WOULD TEST THE HIGH

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.996
SPEED RAIL TRAINS AT THEIR AT

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.264
THEIR MAXIMUM SPEED SO.

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.233
MULTIPLE CONSIDERATIONS AGAIN

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.001
THAT'S THE FOCUS -- CONSISTENT

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:11.603
WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.504
BUSINESS PLAN AS LOOKING AT THE

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.240
VALLEY TO VALLEY A SEGMENT.

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.041
AND AND DO YOU HAVE A SENSE MEAN

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.376
PAINT PAINT US IT IS MUCH OF

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:19.944
PICTURES YOU CAN HAR GOING

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:22.647
FORWARD -- I I'M I'M JUST I'M

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:23.481

CERTAINTY RIGHT NOW AND I I I I

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:30.188

FLOWING THE PROP ONE A BOND

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.807
FUNDS TO LA UNION STATION WHEN

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:23.841
THAT PROJECT GOES TO

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.677
CONSTRUCTION AS WELL HI MINE

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:27.979
SENSE ON THAT BUT I BELIEVE AS

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.781
YOU KNOW AS EARLY AS SAID THIS.

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:31.983
LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR THOSE --

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.918
THOSE FUNDING AGREEMENTS NO THIS

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:34.986
FUNDING AGREEMENTS ARE PART OF

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.788
THE PROVISIONS OF PROP ONE A

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:38.990
THAT -- WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.958
CONSULTANT LOOK AT THE FUNDING

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:43.294
AGREEMENT AND COME FORWARD WITH

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.629
WITH THOSE PLANS SO THOSE ARE.

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.197
A ANTICIPATED FOR LATER THIS

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.066
CALENDAR YEAR IT HAS TO GO

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:49.734
THROUGH THE THICK THERE'S A

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:50.935
STUDY THAT STILL HAS TO BE DONE --

00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:53.571
CONSULTANT ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.573
ARE GOING TO SO THE AXIS

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.607
PROGRESS FONG CHIEF FINANCIAL

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:57.608
OFFICER.

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.043
ACCESS THE PROBLEM A FUNDS WE

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.845
HAVE TO DO -- FUNDING FEE PLAN

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:01.879
IN THE FUNDING THE PLANS THAT

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:02.447
ACTUALLY RUNS THROUGH YOUR

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:03.348
OFFICE.

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.015
A PART OF THE FUN THE

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:05.216
REQUIREMENT FOR THE FUNDING THE

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:06.217
PLAN IS WE HAVE TO GET AN

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.586
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS ON WHETHER

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.288
THIS PLAN ACTUALLY MAKES OUT.

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:15.026
AND THAT'S WHAT -- SECONDARY

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:16.027
ADDIS'S REFERRING.

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:16.561
TO SO YOU THERE'S STILL A

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:17.662
DISCRETIONARY DECISION AS TO

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:18.296
WHETHER THAT MAKES SENSE EXACTLY

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:18.863
WE HAVE A THAT HAS NOT BEEN

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.298
DECIDED BY.

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:22.066
THE SECRETARY OR BY THE HIGH

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.435
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WHETHER IT

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:25.069
ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE WELL

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:25.703
THROUGH ON THOSE I THINK I COULD

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:26.671
SAY THAT WE WE THINK IT MAKES

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.539
SENSE WHY WE HAVE TO DO IS FILL

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:29.907
THE PROP ONE A STATUTORY

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:32.143
REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE INCLUDED --

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.745
THIS REPORT WITHOUT DEPENDENT

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.446
ANALYSIS THAT IS SHARED WITH

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:36.080
THAT.

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.882
THE LEGISLATURE THIRD PARTY

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:39.417
VALIDATION OF OUR OKAY

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:40.918
UNDERSTOOD AND ELLIE -- JUST I

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.388
MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU POINTED

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.756
OUT THAT.

00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:45.390
THE MONIES ARE TO GOES UP TO A

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:46.657
POINT AND THEN WE DON'T REALLY

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:50.595
KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE --

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:51.496
NEW BUT JUST.

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:54.165
THE ELABORATE ON THAT.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.067
SURE SO THIS PLAN IDENTIFIES

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.168
FUNDING FOR THAT MERCED TO

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:59.203
BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AND THE

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.405
AUTHORITY IS INDICATED THIS IS A

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:01.806
BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH AND THAT

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.674
YOU KNOW ALTERNATELY I THINK THE

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.909
GOAL IS TO DO MORE THAN THAT.

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.645
AT THIS TIME ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.679
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:10.047
TIGHT JUST EVEN DO THE MERCED TO

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.049
BAKERSFIELD -- AND THERE'S NO

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:13.451
FUNDING THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:14.619
BEYOND THAT AT THIS POINT SO

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.354
THAT ASSUMES FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:17.755
FUNDING THAT YOU KNOW CAP AND

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.757
TRADE FUNDING -- TO TWENTY

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.092
THIRTY SO YOU KNOW THAT'S SORT

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.460
OF WHAT'S IN CURRENT STATUTE IT

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.495
ASSUMES THAT WE KEEP THE FEDERAL

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:25.797
FUNDING THAT WE'VE THAT'S AT

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.899
RISK -- ADDED ASSUMES ALL OF THE

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.901
PROP ONE EIGHTY FIVE SO SHOULD

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.035
THE THE STATE WANT TO MOVE

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:33.104
FORWARD WITH A SEGMENT BEYOND

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:36.140
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- I SOME

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:37.341
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES ARE

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.177
GONNA HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AND

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.645
THOSE COULD BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.346
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL WILL

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:43.981
CHANGE ITS TUNE ALTHOUGH AT THIS

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:45.850
TIME THAT'S ON CLEAR -- YOU KNOW

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.885
PERHAPS YOU KNOW OF OTHER ACTION

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.620
TO BE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:50.254
TO IDENTIFY OTHER FUNDING

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.122
SOURCES AND BY THE

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.424
ADMINISTRATION BUT AT THIS TIME

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:54.559
THERE'S THERE'S NO OR YOU KNOW

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.260
MAYBE PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:57.261
WILL COME AND BUT AT THIS.

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:59.163
POINT WE WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.298
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT.

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.933
IS THAT INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:03.434
SORT OF LEAVE YOURSELF

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.870
FLEXIBILITY YOU OR OR IS IT THAT

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:10.708
THE MONEY'S JUST NOT THURMOND

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.310
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT.

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:12.910
THIS SORT OF UNCERTAINTY GOING

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:15.012
FOR IT I MEAN I WELL HOW DO I

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:15.746
GOING DOWN THE LOS ANGELES OR

00:35:15.813 --> 00:35:16.814
DOWN TO SAN DIEGO OR DOWN TO

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:17.415
WHERE MOST THE PEOPLE IN THE

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:17.982
STATE LIVE WHO ARE STUCK IN

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.016
TRAFFIC ALL DAY HOW DO WE TELL

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.117
THEM THAT THE HIGH SPEED.

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.652
RAIL IS COMING AND THAT IT'S

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.254
ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP THEM I

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.356
DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL THEM THAT

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.191
IF THERE'S NO MONEY THERE --

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:29.193
WHEN IN?

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.728
THE ON OF I KNOW USING ONE ED

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:31.896
RIGHT BUT WHATEVER WE'RE NOT

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:32.763
HEARING WE'RE NOT HEARING G. G.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.498
R. AFTER NOT HEARING SORT OF

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:35.666
ANOTHER PLANNED SO HELP ME OUT

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.301
HERE -- HAVE SILLY WELL IN A

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.937
WILL PART OF THIS PLAN IS IN

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.706
SOME RESPECTS MORE CONSERVATIVE

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:43.774
THAN THEM PRIOR PLANTS IN A

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:44.408
COUPLE WAYS.

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:46.677
SO AT IN THE PRIOR PLAN WE

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.145
TALKED ABOUT EXTENDING CAP AND

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:50.081
TRADE TO TWENTY FIFTY FROM

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:50.982
TWENTY THIRTY SO WE DIDN'T COUNT

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.383
THAT REVENUE IN THIS CASE WE

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.887
LOOKED AT THE AUTHORITY WE HAVE.

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:56.487
TO TWENTY THIRTY ON THE COST

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:57.822
SIDE -- WE INCREASE THE

00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:59.190
CONTINGENCY BY ABOUT A BILLION

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:01.259
DOLLARS SO THIS IS A VERY

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.860
FOCUSED AND LOOKING AT THE MONEY

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.228
WE HAVE TODAY.

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.596
AND I THINK THAT PROJECTS AT A

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:08.533
STAGE WHERE DELIVERY IS CRITICAL

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:09.667
WE NEED TO DELIVER THE

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:11.135
CONSTRUCTION WE'RE DOING IN THE

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.336
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:13.804
ULTIMATELY DELIVER HIGH SPEED

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.506
RAIL TRAINS THAT ARE RUNNING ON

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.575
THE SEGMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.143
VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.978
SO THERE IS A BIT OF AN INCREASE

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.713
FOCUSED ON ON THOSE THINGS --

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.715
THE GOVERNOR SAID HE STILL HAS

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:26.450
THAT VISION OF THAT THE FULL

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:27.518
SYSTEM.

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.120
IT'S DIFFICULT -- TO MOVE

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:30.955
FORWARD WITHOUT A FEDERAL

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.490
PARTNER THAT'S INTERESTED IN

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.026
CONTINUING THE FUNDING I BELIEVE

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:40.631
IN THE FUTURE THAT'S GOING TO

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.466
CHANGE A AB NOT IMMEDIATELY.

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:43.701
BUT THERE'S MANY STATES THAT ARE

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:44.335
INTERESTED IN HIGH SPEED RAIL.

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.736
AND I THINK WITH THE CHANGING

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:46.938
TECHNOLOGY EDGED CHAIN IN THE

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:48.239
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I THINK

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:49.974
HIGH SPEED RAIL MAKES EVEN MORE

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.175
SENSE.

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.177
AND YOU KNOW -- COMMUTER RAIL

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.079
ANOTHER RAIL SYSTEMS MAKE EVEN

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.847
MORE SENSE THAN EVER SO YOU KNOW

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:59.116
I I'M LONG TERM OPTIMISTIC THAT

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:01.819
TO YOU KNOW WE WE KEEP BUILDING --

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.855
BUT HAVING A AGAIN DEVELOPING

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.757
THAT INCREASED CREDIBILITY FROM

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.459
THE DELIVERY I THINK IT'S KEY

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.127
NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:12.630
FOCUSED ON THAT AT THIS POINT IN

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:12.830
TIME.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:13.497
IN THIS QUESTION AT

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:14.565
ENVIRONMENTAL ADDITIONAL

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:15.700
ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS ARE

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.868
ANALYSES NEEDED ON THE BOOK AND

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:18.769
SIDE OF THINGS.

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:21.238
CAN YOU COMMENT ON ON THAT ISSUE

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.740
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S I MEAN

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.342
HOW HOW MANY STEPS AWAY ARE WE

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.810
FROM ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO BACK

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:26.877
TO SEVEN CALIFORNIA LIKE THIS IS

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.713
DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN AS

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:29.814
OPPOSED TO LIKE.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.315
WE GOTTA WAIT FOR A NEW

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:32.383
ADMINISTRATION OR CHANGE THE

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.454
DATA TO THEIR OR ADDITIONAL

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.588
FUNDING MATERIALIZING LIKE.

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.656
OKAY BEYOND THE SECURING THE

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:39.957
FUNDING IS THERE ALSO AS

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:42.259
RIGOROUS Là SERVE MULTIPLE

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:43.661
HOOPS WE'VE GOT TO JUMP THROUGH

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:44.295
AND SEE CA OUR OTHER FRIENDS

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.563
RIGHT NOW.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.198
WELL AS FOR THE LOS ANGELES

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:49.233
UNION STATION PROJECT TO THAT

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.235
INITIAL SCOPE THROUGH INITIAL

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.771
CONSTRUCTION HAS HAS RECEIVED

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:55.339
FULL FUNDING OF BOTH HROUGH THE

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:56.540
HIGH SPEED RAIL BOOK IN FUNDING

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.309
BUT ALSO THROUGH ONE OF THESE

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.777
THAT TRANSIT INTERCITY.

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:02.113
RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM THE SP ONE

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.581
CAP AND TRADE GRANTS.

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:05.916
BUT IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:07.585
ENVIRONMENTAL STAGE RIGHT NOW --

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:11.789
LA UNION STATION.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:14.525
AT OR AT LA METRO IS IS IS OF

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:16.527
THE YES THE SPONSOR THE

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:17.028
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS.

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:18.963
AND THEY HAVE -- GOING FORWARD

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.399
WITH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS AT

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.868
WITH THIS SEQUEL FIRST STRATEGY --

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.403
SO THEY'RE PUT OUT THE SECRET

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.571
DOCUMENTS ADVANCING KNOWS --

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.840
THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTY

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:30.908
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:34.178
GOING TO ASK IF ANY BUT YEAH SO.

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:35.646
SOME WAY TO YEAH I STREAMLINED

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.848
BASED ON SEEK WOULD IN THEORY IF

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.417
YOU COULD TEAR OFF THAT AND IT

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.918
IS THAT WHAT IT DID WHAT'S UP

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.219
THE MOST IS TO DO THEM AT THE

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.321
SAME TIME AND AND LACK OF

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:44.622
ENGAGEMENT.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:48.159
BUT OF BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:50.227
BISCUITS CAUSING A RISK HERE I

00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:51.529
IN INCLUDING THE LA UNION

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.863
STATION PROJECT THAT THEY'RE

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.098
PURSUING THE SEQUEL FIRST

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.033
STRATEGY TO ADVANCE THAT SIDE OF

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.867
IT.

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:59.870
I LONGER TERM -- WE HAVE -- AT

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:01.405
THAT I THINK MORE THAN A YEAR

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:03.441
AGO WAS SUBMITTED THE DOCK IN

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:06.077
THE INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.712

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.047
REQUESTING NEPA ASSIGNMENT --

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.148
FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:12.349
STREAMLINING MAJOR IT'S

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:14.452
SOMETHING THAT CALTRANS ENJOYS

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.753
FOR HIGHWAY AND ROAD PROJECTS

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.055
SINCE I THINK ABOUT.

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:18.622
TWO THOUSAND SIX AND IT'S A

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.658
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF TIME

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.793
WHICH THEN RESULTS IN A

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.995
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF MONEY.

00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:27.264
AND SO WITH FAT -- WE'VE APPLIED

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.433
FOR THAT UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT --

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.603
AUGUST OF LAST YEAR -- THE

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.942

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:31.188
LEADING TO THAT -- THE PROPOSAL

RUN A SERVICE THAT REQUIRES AN

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.028
OPERATING SUBSIDY BUT THE

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.830
EXISTING COMMUTER LINES EXISTING

SO WHAT THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:47.805
LOOKED AT WAS HOW THAT WOULD

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:49.573
CHANGE WITH AND WITHOUT HIGH

EXISTING CONNECTING BUS SERVICE.

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:00.384
THE TEARS ESTIMATED THAT THE

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.286
OPERATING SUBSIDY WOULD ACTUALLY

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.521
FALL WITH THE ADVENT OF HIGH

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.023
AGGRESSIVE.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.892
A SCENARIO ONE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.828
WHICH SHOULD BE A STEADY.

00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:01.965
FLOW OF MONEY HOW DO WE CLOSE

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.368
THE OTHER FORTY FIVE BILLION

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:04.802
DOLLAR CASH.

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:05.436
VIOLENCE THAT'S THE FIRST

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:07.237
QUESTION AND IN THE SECOND

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.039
QUESTION WHICH I'M SURE MY

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:10.307
COLLEAGUES WHO I CAN ALWAYS SAID

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:12.242
SAID WHAT'S YOUR THINKING AND

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:15.245
THAT THE NEW -- PLAN WE'RE WITH

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.380
THAT.

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:18.782
EXTRA MONEY GO WITH THAT BE TO

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.784
THE BOOK IN ST LOS ANGELES THE

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.020
GILROY A SEGMENT.

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:26.457
OR TWO PALMDALE HEIGHT ON THE OF

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:27.791
WHAT WE DO IF YOU IF YOU ONLY

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.059
GOT A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU NEEDED

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:29.927
WHAT WOULD BE.

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.096
FROM YOUR ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.664
SEE ME TO LET YOU LOOK AT LOTS

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.065
OF SCENARIO SO THERE WAS THAT.

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.934
THE THE CITY ARE YOU CHOSE WAS

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.636
NUMBER ONE SO BUT NUMBER.

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.138
TWO ONE THREE HOW WOULD THAT

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:45.175
WORK AND WELL AS A GAMER PLANS

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:45.909
YEAH.

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:46.543
FIRST OF ALL I I WOULD TAKE THAT

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.846
INCREASING CAP AND TRADE

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:49.146
[inaudible]

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:52.182
AND COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.917
SO LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT WE

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:55.853
KNOW FOR SURE TODAY SO WE HAVE

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.254
TWO SCENARIOS ON OUR SIXTEEN

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.389
BUSINESS PLAN EIGHTEEN AND AND

00:45:59.456 --> 00:45:59.923
THE CURRENT PROJECT OF THE

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.557
REPORT.

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:02.059
WEST MADE AT THE LOW END IF WE

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.293
WERE TO GET FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.662
IN CAP AND TRADE THE TWO

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.263
THOUSAND THIRTY WE WOULD HAVE

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.698
ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.500
DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT --

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:10.834
IF THAT CAP AND TRADE COMES IN

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.402
AT SEVEN FIFTY AND THAT'S OUR

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.303
HIGHER SCENARIO.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.806
WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THREE

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:17.474
POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:18.342
THAT'S A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:19.443
INCREASE ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.445
TALKING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:21.945
YOU CAN TO SEE HOW THIS

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:23.814
ACCUMULATES.

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:24.681
BUT THE CHALLENGE AGAIN WOULD

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.816
COME TRADE IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.117
IT COMES IN AND I WOULD

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:29.153
ENCOURAGE YOU. TO ALSO LOOK AT

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:31.088
SOME TYPE OF STABILITY IN THE

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.222
PROGRAM.

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.157
BECAUSE THE FLUCTUATION OF CAP

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.825
AND TRADE A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:35.993
A PROJECT THIS LARGE.

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:37.027
WHEN YOU'RE WE MIGHT GET A BIG

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.795
BOX OF IT TWICE AS MUCH AS WE

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:39.563
PLANNED THE OTHER YOU KNOW

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.031
ANOTHER YEAR COULD COME IN QUITE

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:41.999
A BIT LESS?

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.301
SO OBVIOUSLY A HIGHER CAP WOULD

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:46.870
BE WONDERFUL FOR THE PROJECT IT

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:48.505
WOULD CLOSE THE GAP.

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.506
I'LL BUT I ALSO WOULD COURAGE

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.107
LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF STABILITY

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.208
AND THE FLUCTUATION OF WHAT WE

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:52.643
GET EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.478
THAT THAT'S REALLY THE KEY THE

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:55.812
TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THIS PROJECT

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.281
IS HOW MUCH.

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:57.915
ACTUAL CASH WE'RE GONNA GET PER

00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:01.385
YEAR.

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:01.952
ABOUT GETTING INTO.

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.420
A GREAT DISCUSSION PART OF THAT

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.689
WAS THE EXTENSION TO TWENTY

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:08.192
THIRTY AND THE CUSHION OF TWO

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.093
THIRDS VOTE THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.762
THAT THAT THE UNCERTAINTY WAS.

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.197
WAS RELEASED I GUESS THIS

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:15.199
FOLLOWING HIS VICTORY IN THIS IS

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.800
THAT IS THAT WHAT WOULD WHAT

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.902
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT IF WE IF

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:22.339
WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS --

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.241
DELIVERY OFFICE OF OF OPERATING

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:26.243
SEGMENT WHAT WOULD BE NEXT WERE

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.078
IN THE LOGICAL SEQUENCE AND WHAT

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.112
WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:29.546
WAYS.

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:30.781
TALK TO THESE PEOPLE ON LOS

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:33.617
ANGELES ABOUT WHEN IT'S COMING.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.452
BUT CERTAINLY ENTION TOO THAT --

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.554
THE CAP AND TRADE RISING IS SAID

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.022
MAYBE A RISING THAT WATER LINE

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.324
THEIR LIVES OTHER VOTES TO

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.625
INCLUDING HE HAD.

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.060
TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.962
PROGRAM THAT RECEIVES MONEY

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.096
THERE SO.

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:47.698
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS IT I THINK

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.499
FUNDED THE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.767
METROLINK ABOUT A BILLION

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.502
DOLLARS IN THE IN THE LAST ROUND

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:55.339
SO THAT THAT HELPS ON MULTIPLE --

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:58.942
SCORES -- BUT YEAH CORDY AT THE

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:00.344
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN I

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.979
LOOKED AT IT AGAIN THE VALLEY TO

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.413
VALLEY.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.582

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:12.189
FRANCISCO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.390
AND THEN.

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:15.559
BRIDGING THAT GAP THAT.

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.595
TO GILROY -- TO THE MADERA GAP

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.330
AS THE WHAT'S CURRENTLY -- AT

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:21.832
THAT TIME WAS LISTED AS THE THE

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.300
MAJOR FINDING PEACE SO HE WANTED

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.102
TO FOCUS ON THAT.

00:48:25.168 --> 00:48:26.737
AGAIN I I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.472

WAS SOME INITIAL SURPRISE AYE

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.506
AYE HE DID NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.241
OF REVIEWING THAT PRETTY

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.776
SIGNIFICANT STAFFING INCREASE.

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.111
THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.113
THE CURRENT YEAR -- THIS SO JUST

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.948
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.317
LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND I THINK

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.418
THERE WAS AS MAYBE SOME ELEMENT

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.520
OF SURPRISE FOLKS GET EXPECTED

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:58.254
WE CONTINUE TO GO UP BUT MAYBE

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.322
NOT.

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.623
I'M QUITE SO DRAMATICALLY OVER

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.025
THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.059
THOSE OUT YOUR PRODUCTIONS THAT

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.260
THEY PROVIDED LAST YEAR AND IT

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.528
DOES SHOW THAT SO I'M NOT

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:06.429
ENTIRELY AWARE OF THE

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.798
CONVERSATIONS AND AND WHERE SOME

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:09.799
OF THAT CAME FROM.

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:11.501
AND RELATIVE TO THIS I REQUEST

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.835
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:15.405
THE NINETEEN TWENTY AND PROPOSAL

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.105
IT'S A RELATIVELY MODEST

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:16.839
INCREASE.

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:19.242
AND AS WAS STATED IT'S AND FORTY

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.009
EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.512
WHICH AMOUNTS TO ACTUALLY

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:23.646
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE STATE --

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:24.747
STAFF POSITIONS THIS IS

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.015
BASICALLY JUST BRINGING DOWN THE

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.550
AMOUNT OF OVERTIME IN INCREASING

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.285
THE NUMBER OF STAFF TO SORT OF

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.686
MORE OF THE HISTORICAL LEVELS

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:31.788
AND NOW THAT.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:32.789
THE DEPARTMENTS OUT OF THAT

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.791
IMMEDIATE YOU KNOW NEED TO BRING

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.659
ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RIGHT

I'M AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB.

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:39.562
ONE AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.463
YEAR OF HAVING A PRETTY MODEST

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.531
INCREASE PROVIDES A GOOD

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:44.167
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE --

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.668
TO GET MORE INFORMATION OF

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.470
BEFORE AND POTENTIAL REQUESTS

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.038
FOR FUTURE INCREASES COME DOWN

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.107
THE LINE AND THE NEXT YEAR OR

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.442
TWO OR THREE ON TO THE EXTENT

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.409
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.511
ANOTHER YOU KNOW THOUSAND TO TWO

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.180
THOUSAND POSITION REQUEST -- AND

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:58.781
THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE PAST OUR

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.783
OFFICE HAS A HANDSOME AND

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.152
CONCERNS I'M ABOUT THE BUDGETING

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.187
METHODOLOGY IN THE PROJECT

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.688

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.190
USED BY CALTRANS.

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.858
AND AN IMPASSE REVIEWS FOUND

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.259
THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY TO

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.228
OVERSTATE THE NEED FOR RESOURCES

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.696
AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:16.132
HAD A WORKING GROUP THAT HAD --

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.667
SIMILAR FINDINGS AS WELL.

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.635
IN RESPONSE TO THOSE CONCERNS

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.137
MANY CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.438
HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE SO THE

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.607
DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.709
STEPS -- INTERNALLY TO IMPROVE

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.044
THEIR AND THEIR BUDGETING

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.313
PROCESS TO IMPROVE THEIR I'M

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:37.153
DATA TRACKING AND THE ACCURACY

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:37.720
OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.589
THERE SYSTEM THAT WILL TIMIDLY

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:40.723
RESULTS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.691
ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.426
ON THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.460
INACTIVE ENACTMENT OF ON SB ONE

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.094
AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATION HAS

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:45.862
GIVEN THE TRANSPORTATION

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.562
COMMISSION THIS ROLE IN DOING

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.598
PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT -- WHERE

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.633
YOU HAVE AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.901
ENTITY NOW?

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.736
OVERSEEING -- MUCH IN THE SAME

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.438
WAY THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DO FOR

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.406
OTHER CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.542
AND BECAUSE CALTRANS IS SO LARGE

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.810
IN THE NUMBER PROJECTS IS SO

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:02.044
GREAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING CAPITAL

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.013
L. A. B. C. PIECE TO REVIEW FOR

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.415
EVERY PROJECT.

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:07.016
THAT'S MORE AND A SORT OF A A

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.651
CAT IN LINE WITH THE FUNCTION

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:09.152
THAT THE TRANSPORTATION

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:11.287
COMMISSION -- PERFORMS IN

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.523
ALLOCATING TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:14.624
SO WHAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.758
RECOMMEND IS THIS IS A GOOD

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:16.759
OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.060
INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND THAT

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.428
YOU ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:20.329
LANGUAGE.

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.697
REQUIRING THE TRANSPORTATION

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:23.766
COMMISSION -- TO DO A LOOK BACK

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.735
ANALISIS ON A SAMPLE OF PROJECTS

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:26.903
ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT WHAT IT

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.504
THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE IT WAS

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.872
GOING TO NEED HOW DID THAT

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.108
CHANGE OVER TIME AND WHERE DID

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:32.775
WE ACTUALLY.

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:34.577
I AM AND THAT COULD BE VERY

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.579
HELPFUL ON IN A NUMBER OF WAYS

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.047
NOT ONLY IN FORMING COS BUT JUST

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:39.549
I MEAN AN UNDERSTANDING -- WHAT

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:40.716
AT THE TIME LINES AND COSTS

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.685
CHANGES LOOK LIKE FOR PROJECTS

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:44.187
OVER TIME ON AND THEN THEY COULD

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.488
COMPARE THAT TO THE AMOUNT THAT

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.023
WAS REQUESTED IN THE BUDGET FOR

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.658
THOSE PROJECTS FOR THE LAST

REALLY GETTING TO THE ACCURACY

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.800
OF THE ESTIMATES.

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:34.637
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY AND

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.272
CAL TRANS OR THE PROJECT

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.274
MANAGERS ARE SOMEWHERE

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:39.809
INCENTIVIZE WE HAVE A MISALIGNED

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.978
INCENTIVE. FOR THEM TO OVER

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.879
ESTIMATE THE BUDGET -- IF

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.147
THEY'RE BEING HELD THE COMING IN

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.617
HONOR UNDER BUDGET AND THEY YOU

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.018
KNOW S. ESTIMATORS MIGHT BE

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.152
SOMEWHAT CONSERVATIVE WHEN

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.187
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.622
AMOUNT THAT THEY NEED.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.290
AND THE AND IN ADDITION IF

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.524
CALTRANS HAS TO GO TO THE

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:57.126
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION EVERY

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.228
TIME THERE'S A CHANGE -- AND

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.630
THAT'S AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.732
THEY PERHAPS I DON'T WANT TO DO

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:03.866
AND SORT OF A HIGHLIGHTS IF

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:04.900
THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.869
PROJECT WORK JUST TAKES

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:07.570

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:08.204
TIME.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.506
SO THERE AND THE IN PAST REVIEWS

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.874
AND LOOKING AT HOW THE ESTIMATE

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:14.110
PROJECT BUDGETS I'M A FOR

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:14.543
SOMEONE.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.911
UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS FROM THE

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.079
DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE THERE

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.247
DO SEEM TO BE SOME OF THESE

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.348
INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO OVER

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:21.951
ESTIMATE WHAT IS NEEDED AND SO.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.152
WENT WHEN THOSE SAME ESTIMATES

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.553
ARE THAN FEEDING INTO THINGS

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.888
LIKE BUDGET REQUEST IT BECOMES

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.922
VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.324
LEGISLATURE TO KNOW WAS JUST THE

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.559
RIGHT AMOUNT TO RESIST TOO MUCH

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.394
AND HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT IT AND

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:31.794
SO.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.329

OPTIONAL TO MEET THESE TARGETS.

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.598
V. BUDGET SHOULD DESIGNATE ALSO

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:04.966

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.899

DESIGNATE THAT.

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:46.674
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER

EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.893
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE TRASH

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.894
