AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:38.007
BILL. BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ZERO

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.208
SAN ON SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:40.476
VERY CONCERNING TO ME OVER THE

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.645
LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:45.348
LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PASS.

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:45.882
THAT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:48.551
GOVERNMENT. FROM THESE

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:52.021
PROTECTIONS- AND IT WAS ONE OF

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.256
THE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME AS I

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.023
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.558
WOULD INCLUDE BOTH PRIVATE AND

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.726
PUBLIC ENTITIES BECAUSE IT

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.995
DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT TYPE OF

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.229
ENTITY YOU ARE IF YOU ALLOW

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.931
THIS TO GO ON. THERE NEEDS TO

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.566
BE JUSTICE ASSOCIATED THERE

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.869
WITH. AND WE ACTUALLY SAW MANY

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.771
THINGS. THAT INVOLVE GOVERNMENT

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:12.241
YOU KNOW. PROBABLY MOST NOTABLY

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.210
MICHIGAN STATE AND WHAT THEY

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.712
DID TO OLYMPIANS AND WHAT THEY

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.381
ALLOWED TO BE DONE- TO

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.116
OLYMPIANS OVER YEARS AND YEARS-

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.618
WAS PUT ON A FULL VIEW FOR

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:27.557
EVERYONE SO I DON'T THINK WE

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.359
CAN CONTINUE TO GO ON I DON'T

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:29.926
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE IN THE

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.794
FIRST PLACE. GO ON EXCLUDING

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.230
GOVERNMENT FROM THESE

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.767
PROTECTIONS- WHEN ACTUALLY

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.536
GOVERNMENT IN MANY CASES HAS

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.572
BEEN ONE OF THE GROSSEST.

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:45.742
ABUSERS AND HAS TURN THE OTHER

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.311
WAY- IN MANY WAYS OF OVER THE

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:52.749
YEARS- HOLLYWOOD. YOU KNOW

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.549
BEING ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE-

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.685
THE- FOR THESE TYPES OF

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.353
PRACTICES THAT ALLOWED THINGS

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.023
TO GO GO ON AND TURN A BLIND

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:02.091
EYE WE GIVE THEM A TAX CUT. OR

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.559
A TAX CREDIT A COUPLE YEARS

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:06.729
AGO- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.398
THERE IS JUSTICE ACROSS THE

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:08.931
BOARD THERE SHOULD BE AN

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.000
EXCLUSION. FOR A GROUP NOW A

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.869
LOT OF PEOPLE BRING UP WELL

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:13.770
IT'S GOING TO COST US MONEY.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:18.074
WELL LAST I CHECKED JUSTICE

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.176
SHOULDN'T BE COMING WITH A

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.378
DOLLAR SIGN ON IT AS TO HOW

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.980
MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST YOU

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.082
IT'S EITHER JUST FOR ITS NOT.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:29.252
AND IS NOT JUST TO ALLOW THE-

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.420
THESE GROUPS JUST BECAUSE

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.255
THEY'RE PUBLIC IN JUST BECAUSE

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.991
THE STATE MIGHT HAVE LIABILITY.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.559
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE UC HAS AN

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.227
INSURANCE POLICY AND I THINK

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.329
VERY MUCH VERY MUCH OF. THESE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.098
CLAIMS SHOULD COME OUT OF THEIR

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.566
BUDGETS AND THEIR INSURANCE

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:47.003
POLICIES BUT CERTAINLY THE

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.406
STATE DOES HAVE RISK BUT THAT

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.974
THAT COMES WITH OPERATING STATE

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.709
GOVERNMENTS AND WHEN PEOPLE

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.878
HAVE DONE WRONG AS IS VERY

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.048
CLEAR IN THIS CASE. IN THE CASE

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.150
OF UCLA AND I AND I DON'T KNOW

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.854
IT. THE OTHER CONCERN I WOULD

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:05.388
SAY IS RIGHT NOW ARE ONLY

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.824
FOCUSING ON ONE. AND MAYBE AS A

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.492
PRACTICAL MATTER THAT'S- YOU

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.327
KNOW WHY WE'RE FOCUSING ON UCLA

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.695
BUT I THINK EVERY PUBLIC

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:19.135
UNIVERSITY. THAT DID THESE KIND

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:19.635
OF THINGS WHEN THEY WERE

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.904
COMPLAINTS FILED INVESTIGATIONS

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:25.308
THAT WERE NOT SHARED WERE HEADS

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.710
WERE TURNED THE OTHER WAY AND

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:31.180
THEREBY VICTIMS- STATUES

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.749
LIMITATIONS PASSED. JUSTICE

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.252
REQUIRES THAT THEY FACE THAT

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:39.122
THAT THEY HAVE THE EXTENSION

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:39.722
AND THE ABILITY TO BRING THEIR

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:43.059
CLAIMS. THEIR RIGHTFUL CLAIMS.

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.560
AGAIN SEIZE ENTITIES AND JUST

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.696
BECAUSE OUR PUBLIC IT MIGHT

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:49.665
COST THE STATE MONEY. SHOULD

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:50.266
NOT BE A JUSTIFICATION TO STOP

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:53.302
THAT. AND SO I WILL BE

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.570
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.906

IF SOMEONE'S IN A POSITION OF

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.982
POWER IN ABUSING THAT POWER THE

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.850
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.218
VICTIMS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:09.952
NEED TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:12.655
COURT- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.256

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.725

CALIFORNIA HIM HERE'S ONE IS

01:13:57.733 --> 01:14:01.136
BECAUSE- IF THE TENANT STOPS

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:05.874
PAYING THAT. AMOUNT THEN WE ARE

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.277

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.350
IMPORTANTLY WHETHER. IT CAN

RENT IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:28.697

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:34.369
DEPOSIT- PAYMENT IS ANOTHER

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:34.970

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:35.871

MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:55.857
MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:56.825
WHAT I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:57.959
THIS BILL OVER THE WEEKEND I

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.861
JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:00.996
OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD ABOUT

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:04.833
IT- IF A TENANT ELECTS TO

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.535
PURCHASE AN INSURANCE POLICY IN

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.403
LIEU OF A SECURITY DEPOSIT-

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.539
OBVIOUSLY THAT INSURANCE POLICY

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:11.706
IS GOING TO REQUIRE RENEWAL IF

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.475
THE TENANT. STAYS IN THE UNIT

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:16.244
BECAUSE THE EXPOSURE TO RISK OF

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.547
THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS BASED

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.381
ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.183
THE- THE TO THE TENETS OF THE

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.351
UNIT SO. NOT IN THE EVENT THAT

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:24.886
THE TENANT FAILS TO RENEW THE

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:26.922
INSURANCE POLICY WHAT WHAT THEN

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.123
HAPPENS BECAUSE THE BILL REALLY

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.524
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THAT YEP.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:30.525
AND I APPRECIATE OUR

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:31.726
CONVERSATION I BE ONE TO WORK

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:32.761
WITH YOU ONCE AMENDMENTS TO

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.963
CLARIFY THAT IF. OTHER TEN DOES

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.231
NOT PAY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:39.434
AND THEY WOULD BE THE- M. THEY

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.068
BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE SECURITY

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:43.138
DEPOSIT. FOR SOMETHING THAT IF

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.272
OKAY THEY WERE. ON IF THEY

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:47.142
DON'T THEN WHAT. LEADING BY OF

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:50.178
THE LEASE TERMS DOWN. THEY BE

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.813
AFFECTED. ACTUALLY IF THEY'RE

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.814
NOT GOING TO PAY THE INSURANCE

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:53.415
ARE NOT GONNA BE THE SECURITY

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.149
DEPOSIT THE LAND THERE DOES

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:55.283
NEED SOME KIND OF PROTECTION

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.551
THERE BUT SIDE BE WILLING TO

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:57.452
WORK WITH YOU ON SOME LANGUAGE

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.120
THAT EFFECT OKAY I APPRECIATE

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:00.855
THAT I HAVE THAT'S MY CONCERN

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.624
ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT. THE

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.426
REASON WHY SECURITY DEPOSITS

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.061
EXIST YES TO PROTECT THE

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.963
LANDLORD FROM POTENTIAL DAMAGE

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:08.897
THAT THE TENANT DOES TO THE

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.031
UNIT SINCE THE TENET DOESN'T

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.767
ONLY UNIT. YEAH I THINK IT'S

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.803
CRITICAL THAT WE PRESERVE THAT

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:17.606
PROTECTION YEP- I FEAR THOUGH

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:18.974
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FORCED

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:19.908
TO GO TO VERY PROBLEMATIC

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:24.112
DIRECTION BECAUSE- THERE'S NO

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.481
GETTING AWAY. FROM THE NEEDED

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.816
TO EFFECT THE TEN AND IF THEY

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.551
FAIL TO MATERIALLY ABIDE BY THE

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.052
TERMS OF THE LEASE. RIGHT NOW

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:32.520
AND IF THE TERMS OF THE LEASE

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:34.522
SAYS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:36.358
A SECURITY DEPOSIT BUT YOU DO

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:36.925
HAVE TO HAVE THIS INSURANCE

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.627
POLICY IN PLACE. AND IF YOU

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.395
FAIL TO DO THAT YOU COULD BE

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.830
AFFECTED THEN WE'RE GOING TO

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.064
HAVE TO ENFORCE THAT AFFECTION.

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:43.898
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU LOOK

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:46.434
AT- YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION THAT

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:47.535
CALIFORNIA STATE POLICIES BEEN

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.037
GOING OUT OF PATIENTS. WE'RE

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.038
GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:50.672
WERE MAKING IT HARDER AND

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.207
HARDER AND HARDER. FOR TENNIS

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.508
TO GET INFECTED. OUT OF

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.477
CONCERN. THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:57.612
PEOPLE TO BE HOMELESS SO- I'M

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.514
JUST AFRAID THAT THAT- THAT'S

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.116
GOING TO BE JUST AN UNWORKABLE

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.817
PROVISION OF THIS BILL. SO I

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:06.121
I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT- WHAT

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.356
SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HAVE THAT

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:12.727
ADDRESS SURE. TO MAKE THE BILL

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:13.261
BUT TO MAKE A BILL PERHAPS

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:14.362
OPTIONAL. DID YOU PILOT PROGRAM

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:15.697
TO SEE HOW. CNN TENNIS TAKE

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.766
ADVANTAGE IT. SEE IF IT CAUSES.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.401
IF IT CAUSES EVICTIONS. AND

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.303
THEN- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE CAN

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:21.903
MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.472
THE FUTURE. THAT'S THE

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.073
DIRECTION I'D LIKE TO SEE THE

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.975
WELCOME. WELL SO COUPLE

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.810
THOUGHTS ON THAT THE BILL IS

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:29.844
ABOUT OPTIONS RIGHT IT'S ABOUT

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:30.979
OPTIONS THAT BOTH PROTECT THE

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.548
LANDLORD- AND I AGAIN I DO WANT

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.649

SCENARIO IF. ATTENDED TO. PAY

THEIR PREMIUM. THAN THEY WOULD

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:39.788
BE EXPECTED TO PAY THEIR

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:40.955
SECURITY DEPOSIT IF THEY

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:42.457
COULDN'T. BE VIOLATING THE

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:44.025
TERMS OF THE LEASE AND- COULD

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:46.328
FACE EVICTION POTENTIALLY-

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.595
ABOUT MAKING THE ENTIRE BILL

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:50.131
OPTIONAL- THAT'S EFFECTIVELY MY

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.734
OPINION GETTING THE BILL- AND

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.470
IT'S OPTIONAL RIGHT NOW. SO

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:56.838
LANDLORDS RIGHT NOW COULD DO A

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:57.806
SIX MONTH PAYMENT PLAN IF THEY

IS REALLY ABOUT. GIVING OPTIONS

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.912
FOR THE TENANTS WHO. ARE GOING

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:04.546
TO NEED THEM DESPERATELY

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.114

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.549
WAVE OF ACTIONS BUT- AGAIN I'M

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:08.316

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.790
OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:20.228
IF THAT'S ALL. FOLKS YOU KNOW

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:21.496

THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.240
FACED WITH WHEN WE TRY TO

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.309
CODIFY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.278
DON'T RENEW YOUR POLICY IS THAT

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.279
THE EVICTION PROCESS TAKES A

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.448
WHILE SO YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.417
FOR A LANDLORD WHO HAS ATTENDED

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:44.519
THE FILTER TO THE POLICY MAYBE

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:45.587
THE POLICY HAS A PROVISION THAT

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:46.888
THE LANDLORD GETS NOTIFIED TO

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.157
LANGUAGE BECAUSE NOTIFIED. THE

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.625
WEEK BEFORE THE POLICY IS DUE

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.927
TO EXPIRE THAT THE TENANT HAS

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:56.297
NOT RENEWED IT SO THE- TENET

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:58.299
DOESN'T REALLY WHAT THE

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.601
LANDLORD PROCEEDS WITH AND IF

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.369
THEY DON'T GIVE THEM THE OPTION

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:02.337
TO PROVIDE A SECURE DEPOSIT

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:03.605
REPLACEMENT POLICY THE TENET

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:06.040
FAILS TO DO THAT WE- FINALLY

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:08.109
THE LANDLORD IS FORCED TO

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.677
BRITISH EIGHT UNLAWFUL DETAINER

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.079
PROCEEDING AGAINST THE TENANTS

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:13.381
YEAH YEAH THE TENETS EVICTED

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:15.350
AND THE LANDLORD GOES AND FINDS

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.618
A BUNCH OF DAMAGE TO THE UNIT

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.320
WHICH IS NOT COVERED BECAUSE

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:19.954
THE CURRENT POLICY. IS WHAT YOU

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.823

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.657
PROCESS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SURE

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.192
I THINK IT'S COULD BE DIFFICULT

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:30.765
TO TRY AND- TO TRY AND- HOW TO

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.200
FLY AROUND THAT THAT. FOR BUT

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:33.334
CERTAINLY WILL MINDED BUT THE

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:35.236
OPPOSING TODAY OF LOVE TO WORK

IT'S KILEY. I THIS IS THE

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.345
REASON THAT I'M SORRY MR KILEY

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.147

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:48.383

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.251
OKAY IF YOU WANT TO BE PROPERLY

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.821
ATTIRED AND OTHER PROTOCOLS.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:57.158
WELL SO IS THERE A REASON THAT-

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.827
SECURITY DEPOSIT LOANS ARE NOT

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.595
A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE IT SEEMS I

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.497
CAN GET A PETTY GOOD AT PRETTY

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.531
DECENT INTEREST RATES AND SOME

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:07.101
YOU. BY SECURITY DEPOSIT ITSELF.

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.504
I BE INTERESTED EXPLORE THAT. I

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.972
MEAN I JUST GO ON AND I SEE

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:11.606
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PROVIDERS

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:12.941
OUT THERE SO I'M WONDERING IF

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.075
THERE ARE THERE YEARS TO

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.109
GETTING ONE OF THESE LOANS THAT

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:17.879
MAKES- THIS POLICY SOLUTION.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.647
NECESSARY I'M I'M HAPPY TO

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:23.151
EXPLORE AND. AGAINST ABOUT

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.886
SPREADING OPTIONS FOR FOLKS.

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:29.224
THANK YOU IT'S TRUE. THANK YOU

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.391
MISTER CHAIR- LET ME FIRST

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:32.460
START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:34.262
FOR. STARTING TO THINK THROUGH

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:35.497
A VERY VERY CHALLENGING

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:37.065
SITUATION FOR US RIGHT NOW AND

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:39.300
THAT IS THE FACT THAT. 40% OF

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.769
ALL CALIFORNIANS CAMP BEFORE

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:43.738
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ANY

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:44.672
ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES DURING

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.941
THE MONTH. SO THE SCENARIO THAT

01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:49.277
WE HAVE IS WE KNOW THAT AND

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:50.979
POTENTIALLY A FEW MONTHS WE MAY

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:53.214
SEE A WAVE OF INFECTIONS. WE

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:55.350
VERY LIKELY WILL HAVE. HUNDREDS

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.718
OF THOUSANDS OFNOT MILLIONS OF

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:58.186
TENANTS TRYING TO LOOK FOR IN

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.988
PLACE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:02.957
SAVINGS TO. QUALIFY FOR SECURE

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.158
DEPOSITS ON A LOT OF WE HAVE

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:06.828
RIGHT NOW SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:07.896
OPPOSITION'S PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:08.863
THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT BUSINESS

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:12.467
AS USUAL- BUT I THINK GIVEN THE

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.035
HOUSING HOMES IS CRISIS ON TOP

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.504
OF THE CORONAVIRUS PRICES. ON

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:19.374
TOP OF THE KLAY FICTION OF.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.309
MONTHS WE HAVE TO THINK THINGS.

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:21.943
I WAS LISTENING TO INTENTLY TO

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.777
THE OPPOSITION I JUST WANNA

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:23.711
MAKE A FEW POINTS ABOUT THE

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.079
OPPOSITION. OF SOME THE

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.781
OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS AS A WAY

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:27.482
OF JUST CONTINUE THE

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:29.083
CONVERSATION. I HEARD MR

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.285
KINGSTON REFER TO THE FACT

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.520
THAT. WE VERY LIKELY MAY SEE A

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.756
TENANT WHO CAN'T AFFORD. THE

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.824
SAY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:37.358
TOP OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.360
DOLLARS. AND I THINK THAT VERY

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.929
WELL COULD BE TRUE. I THINK THE

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.063
QUESTION IS HOW WILL THAT

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.832
TIENEN. GET THREE THOUSAND

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:45.433
DOLLARS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.868
COBBLE TOGETHER SECURE DEPOSIT

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.770
EVEN RENT IN THAT SPOT AND WE

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.838
ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:53.041
HOW TO SOLVE THAT SHEET CAA'S

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:55.009
CONTENTION THAT RIGHT NOW. A

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:55.944
LOT OF LANDLORDS ARE NOT

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.579
CHARGING TWO X. OR THREE X.

01:26:57.645 --> 01:26:59.414
KERN DEPOSIT. IF THAT'S THE

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.615
CASE I MIGHT SUGGEST ANOTHER

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.050
RAP FOR THIS IS WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:02.951
REDUCE THAT TWO X. OF THREE X.

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:04.719
MARK. BUT IF I'M NOT PREPARED

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:05.720
TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO THINK

01:27:05.787 --> 01:27:07.822
ABOUT. CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.024
THIS- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:12.060
IDEA THAT POTENTIALLY WE CAN DO

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:12.760
THIS IN A VOLUNTARY OPTIONAL

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:15.029
WAY. BUT WE KNOW THE REALITY

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.931
IS. THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.633
SOMETHING THAT THE VAST

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.233
MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS ARE CAN

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:22.070
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. AS EVIDENCED

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.805
BY THE OPPOSITION TODAY AND SO.

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.140
MAILLET ASK OF ALL PARTIES IS

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.076
TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:30.011
CONVERSATION- ARE WE HAPPY TO.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.579

MONTH AND SO IT. I THINK WE

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.000
NEED TO BE CREATIVE RATHER THAN

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.435
HAVING FOLKS EVEN IF IT'S A ONE

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.903
X. SECURITY BUSCA SIX THOUSAND

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.205
DOLLARS. IT IS TWO X. OBVIOUSLY

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:31.839
NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE'RE

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:35.009
ASKING A LOT. OF TENANTS TO BE

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.311
ABLE TO COME UP WITH HAT. AND

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:39.113
PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE THIS

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.114
CRISIS AND THIS IS A CRISIS

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:41.816
WHERE. ALL OF US HAVE TO COME

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:45.620
DIFFERENTLY WE'VE BEEN

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.489
ACCUSTOMED TO DOING. AND IN

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.892
THIS CASE I THINK THE RISKS TO

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.226
THE REAL NOT JUST REST WITH THE

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:54.429
REALITY THAT. WE'RE GONNA SEE

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:55.797
AN EXPLOSION AND HOMELESSNESS

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.665
OR AT LEAST A HOUSING AND

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.167
SECURITY EVEN BEYOND WHAT WE

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.035
WERE. IN THE MIDDLE. OF A

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:03.905
BOOMING ECONOMY. AND SO I

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:06.374
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING-

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.275
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.010
PARTIES. TO TRY TO CREATE AS

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.545
MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE.

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:11.846
BUT I AGREE THE SUMMERS YOU

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:12.914
THAT IT CAN'T JUST BE AN

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.316
OPTIONAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE IT IS

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:19.787
AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM AGAIN THEN.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.123
I'M SO THE PROOF YOUR ALLOW. TO

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.124
DECIDE WHAT IT'S GOING TO OCCUR

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:24.759
OR NOT. AND I WOULD ADD MORE

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:25.560
THING IN TURN OF UP TO TEN

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:30.732
LOOPHOLE THAT. IF A TENANT.

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:33.901
CHOOSES RIVER OPS TO DO IT IS

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:36.170
TO A SIX MONTH PAYMENT OR ALONE

01:29:36.237 --> 01:29:37.939
OR HAVE YOU. THAT THEY NOT BE

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.774
BIASED AGAINST. A FOR MAKING

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.175
THAT CHOICE SO COULD VERY WELL

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.944
BE THAT ONCE IS AN AGREEMENT ON

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.613
A LEASE AGREEMENT. THEN THE

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.448
TENANT. IT WILL DECLARES WHAT

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.549
MANNER THEY CHOOSE TO PAY THIS

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:49.684
KERN ABBAS THERE'S GOT SOME

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.952
PROTECTION ON THAT AND-

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.053
OTHERWISE I THINK YOU'LL START

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.122
TO SEE BIASES AGAINST- THOSE

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:55.723
TENANTS AND IT'LL END UP AGAIN

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:56.791
BEING A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:57.992
TENANT WOULD DECIDE NOT TO DO

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.293
IT. BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.995
COMPETING AGAINST. OTHER

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.230
TENANTS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:04.866

CAN HAVE. THE PROTECTION OF

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.837
THOSE OPTIONS SO THE OPTION

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.172
EXISTS HOW CAN WE MAKE IT

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.874
PALATABLE TO ALL PARTIES TO THE

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.509
BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND HOW

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:17.311

FOR TENANTS IN AGAIN THIS

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.681
CRISIS SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:21.783
TO ALL COME TOGETHER IS

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:25.520
CALIFORNIANS. AND MAKING SURE

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:26.587
THAT EVERYONE HAS A HOME SHOULD

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:31.492

BE ADDRESSED THERE'S NO

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.568
QUESTION ABOUT IT I THINK THAT

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:42.036
THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.938
OAKLAND WHEN YOU COMPARE TO MY

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.840
ARIENS SAMPOERNA DINO IT'S NOT

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:47.108
GOING TO BE NINE THOUSAND

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.043
DOLLARS TO MOVE INTO TO AN

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:52.013
APARTMENT. AND SO I WANT TO

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:54.081
CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION IN

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:56.617
THAT REGARD- AND I APPRECIATE

YOUR WILLINGNESS ALSO TO

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.589

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.958
MONTH TO MONTH. IF THEY'RE-

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:06.294
GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO GIVE THE

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.429
DEPOSIT. IT'S IT ISN'T

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:11.098
SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL WORK

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:13.467
FOR THOSE LANDLORDS. I THINK

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.503
TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.371
IS GOOD FOR OUR TENANTS IS

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:19.507
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:21.042
HAVE TO REMEMBER ALSO THAT MANY

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.811
OF THESE LANDLORDS THEY'RE NOT

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:26.747
THE HUNDRED APARTMENT UNITS

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:28.549
MANY OF THEM ARE MOM POP WHO'VE

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:29.817
INVESTED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:32.220
SAVINGS INTO BUYING THESE

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:35.289
RENTALS- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:37.358
THERE ARE PROTECTIONS SO THAT

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.360
THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:41.062
SUBSIDIZING. I THINK FINDINGA

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:43.130
WAY TO GET THE IMPACT ON THOSE

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:46.634
SMALL- POP LANDLORDS IS GOING

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:48.769

THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THIS IS

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.598

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.071
THEY WERE POOR BEFORE THEY

EITHER. THE FEDERAL LAW THERE

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:26.980
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD THE. TWO

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:29.649
NO I THINK THE I YOU. IT AND

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:32.218
COULD AND I THINK THAT THE INTO

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:36.990
IS TO. AT THE- HOLD BILL'S

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:39.325
PROVISIONS IS TO PUT. I'M NOT

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:40.760
PROVIDE ANY TYPE BUT THE CHANGE

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:42.695
OF NOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:45.632
BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUAL GAUGING

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.333
IN THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. THANK

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.971
YOU. I OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:54.274
THE DIVES WITHOUT THIS KIND I

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:54.974
THINK YOU RAISE IT AN

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:57.243
INTERESTING QUESTION AND IT HAS

01:51:57.310 --> 01:52:00.447
TO DO I THINK MORE. OKAY WELL

01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:01.414
ME LET ME JUST FINISH THIS

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.283
THOUGHT THAT MORE WITH THE

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:05.885
POLITICS OF HOW WE PUNISH OR

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:08.488
NOT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.789
TRYING TO GIVE RELIEF FOR

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:11.891
SOMEONE WHO IS INCARCERATED

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:12.926
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PUBLIC

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:15.695
BACKLASH FOR ALL MY GOSH THIS

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.697
IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.165
PERPETRATOR WAR THIS SOMEONE

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.200
WHO HASN'T PAID CHILD SUPPORT

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:22.268
BEFORE SO WHY WOULD WE GIVE

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:23.369
THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE BILL

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:24.404
IT'S REALLY AN EMOTIONAL

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:25.772
RESPONSE AS OPPOSED TO ANY

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:27.173
ECONOMIC OR RATIONAL RESPONSE

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.275
BECAUSE YOU CORRECT. RATIONALLY

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:31.177
ANYONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:32.946
ABILITY TO PAY. WE SHOULD BE

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:34.147
ESSENTIALLY HOLDING THE

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:35.949
OBLIGATIONTO PAY CHILD SUPPORT

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.417
BECAUSE W'RE JUST EXACERBATING

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:38.618
THE SITUATION SO THAT SAME

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.553
LOGIC WOULD IMPLY. BUT OFTEN

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:41.521
TIMES THAT I THINK THERE THIS

01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:43.323
DOES HAVE MORE TO DO WITH WITH

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:43.857
SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.892
FEDERAL LAW. BUT A LOT OF THAT

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:49.095
COMES FROM. THIS IS THIS IS A-

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.564
HEINOUS ENOUGH RYAN OR THIS IS

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.233
AN ON POINT CRIME SO WE'RE NOT

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.167
GOING TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:57.403
OF IT. AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.838
SAFETY LAW CRIMINAL LAW AND

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:00.273
WHEN WE LOOK AT PUNISHMENTS AND

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:02.008
RELEASES REPLETE WITH THESE

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:04.144
KINDS OF. NOT NECESSARILY

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:06.679
RATIONAL POLICY DECISIONS BUT

01:53:06.746 --> 01:53:08.214
EMOTIONAL POLICY DECISIONS

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:10.850
BASED AROUND THE- THE TYPE OF

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.619
OFFENSE AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:53:12.685 --> 01:53:14.087
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THAT

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:15.822
YOU THAT WE SEE THOSE KINDS OF

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:16.923
DISTINCTIONS BEING MADE

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:19.259
OTHERWISE YEAH THERE'S NOT.

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:21.394
NECESSARILY RATIONAL RESPONSE.

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.563
THIS IS A- THANK YOU KNOW AND

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.198
I'M SO SORRY WE HAVEN'T HAD A

01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:25.932
CHANCE TO EVEN SPEAK ABOUT THIS

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:27.500
BILL IN NAME BEEN MEANING ALL

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:28.568
WEEKEND TO CALL YOU AND I DID

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.570
AND SO I APOLOGIZE IF THIS

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:32.071
NEEDS MY VOTE TODAY TO MOVE IT

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:33.673
ON I WILL VOTE FOR IT I'M

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.275
POLICY REASONS BUT I REALLY

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.876
HOPE TO STOP IN A MINUTE. ECHO

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:38.511
THE SAME THING I SAID NOW FOR I

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:40.046
THINK WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:43.016
THREE TIMES. MY CONCERN WITH

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:46.319
THIS BILL IS NOT THAT. THE OVER

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:48.188
REACHING POLICY THAT OF COURSE

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:49.422
OF SOMEBODY CAN'T PAY IT MORE

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.590
PUTTING SOMEBODY FURTHER IN

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:51.357
DEBT IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF

01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:54.027
SENSE- I DO LIKE THE EXCEPTIONS

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:55.728
AND I'M NEXT I THINK QUITE

01:53:55.795 --> 01:53:57.430
FRANKLY THAT THERE ARE RANT BUT

01:53:57.497 --> 01:54:01.201
RARE SITUATIONS. WHERE COUPLES

01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:03.670
CAN DEVOLVE SO BADLY IN A

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:06.873
RELATIONSHIP THAT SAYS THAT-

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.675
OFTEN I'M HAND. WILL RIGHT

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:10.877
WOULD RATHER GO TO JAIL THEN

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:12.712
PAY CHILD SUPPORT AND IS ABOUT

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:15.281
ABUSE AND IT IS ABOUT- CONTROL

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:16.583
OVER A SITUATION THOSE THINGS

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.384
ACTUALLY HAVE HAPPENED. BUT

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:20.987
THAT BEING SAID MY CONCERN IS

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:22.055
THIS POLICY DOESN'T FOCUS ON

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:25.792
THE CHILD WE BENEFIT- THE

01:54:25.858 --> 01:54:26.793
SITUATION MAYBE THE

01:54:26.859 --> 01:54:30.096
INCARCERATED- BY RELIEVING OF

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:32.031
THIS UNREALISTIC PRESSURE TO

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:33.533
PAY CHILD SUPPORT WHERE IN

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.668
PRESENT. BUT IT DOESN'T BENEFIT

01:54:35.735 --> 01:54:36.769
THE CHILD AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:37.770
SEE IN THIS BILL AND I'VE ASKED

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:39.906
FOR NOW IF MULTIPLE TIMES. IS

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:42.375
SOME SORT OF- PARENTING CLASS

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:46.279
OR INVOLVEMENT CLASS THAT THE-

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:47.714
THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.948
TAKE WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.350
SO ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:52.685
PROVIDING ANYTHING FINANCIALLY

01:54:52.752 --> 01:54:53.820
TO THEIR CHILD DURING THAT

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:56.356
TIME. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO OR

01:54:56.422 --> 01:54:58.691
REQUIRE IN ORDER THAT THEIR-

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:00.093
THAT CHILD IS GOING TO

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:02.262
ALTERNATELY HAVE A BENEFIT. OF

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.330
THAT REALLY FOR PAYMENT AND SO-

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:05.765
THAT'S SOMETHING I ASKED FOR I

01:55:05.832 --> 01:55:07.500
HAVEN'T EVER SEEN AND I KNOW

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:08.434
THERE'S SOME. SOME OF THESE

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:11.671
TYPES OF- OF CLASSES THROUGHOUT

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.873
OUR OUR SYSTEM. AND I THINK

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.541
THAT- THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:17.944
MUCH BETTER ABOUT THE PROSPECT

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:20.313
OF LEAVING EVEN FOR MONTHS OR

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.382
YEARS- CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:24.050
THAT ARE COMING ANYWAY YOU KNOW

01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:24.851
WHERE WE WERE ALL VERY

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:26.552
REALISTIC. BUT IF WE'RE TRULY

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.121
CHILD'S CENTRIC AND HOWARD

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:30.390
VIEWING CHILD SUPPORT AND THE

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:32.659
NECESSARY- NEEDS OF A CHILD.

01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.560
THEN SOMETHING THAT FIRST RATE

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:39.499
INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE DOING. IN

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:42.001
ORDER TO. VIRGINIA WITH WITH

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:44.504
MORE DEBT AND I JUST MY FIRST.

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:45.104
ON A BILL LIKE THIS I SAID I

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:46.439
DON'T PLAN TO VOTE FOR TODAY I

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.040
WILL NECESSARY GET OUT OF THIS

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:53.513
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THIS RACE.

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:55.281
I THINK THE BENEFIT THERE IS I

01:55:55.348 --> 01:55:57.750
THINK THE BENEFIT TO THE CHILD

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:59.719
I THINK THAT TO WIN. THE

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:00.987
CHARACTERS INCARCERATED FOR

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:04.824
SUCH A LONG TIME AND IS THEN.

01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:07.260
RELEASED THE CHANCES OF

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:09.095
RETURNING TO THEIR CHILD AND

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:10.430
BEING INVOLVED IN A CHILD'S

01:56:10.496 --> 01:56:13.666
LIFE IS GREATER AND THEY DON'T

01:56:13.733 --> 01:56:16.803
HAVE THE DEBT ON TOP OF THEM. I

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:18.338
DO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:20.239
SAM TO DINO FATHERHOOD TOOK A

STAND ON THIS IS WORLD ARE VERY

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:24.610
IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION IN MY

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:26.612
COMMUNITY AND HAS BEEN WORKING

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:29.482
WITH FATHERS FOR YEARS TO GET

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:30.450
THEM INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILD'S

01:56:30.516 --> 01:56:33.686
LIVES- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:35.421
EVERY POSSIBILITY WHEN WE'RE

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:37.123
TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM. WE

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.392
WANT TO DECREASE RECIDIVISM WE

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:41.427
WANT TO DO WHATEVER IT IS IT'S

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:43.963
POSSIBLE TO. RE INTEGRATE

01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:46.132
SOMEONE IS INTO SOCIETY AS BEST

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:47.467
AS POSSIBLE BUT MOST

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:48.801
IMPORTANTLY TO RE INTEGRATE

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:49.602
THEM INTO THE LIFE OF THE

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:54.640
CHILD. AND IF HAVING THIS.

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.242
TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE THEY

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:58.344
CANNOT PAY THIS IT THE OF A

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.346
CHILD SUPPORT ORDER THERE'S NO

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:02.715
WAY FOR THEM TO PAY IT. AND ALL

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:04.584
WE'RE DOING IS INCREASING THE

01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.919
DEBT UNNECESSARILY. I DO

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:08.488
APPRECIATE THE COMMENT FROM

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.323
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND IF

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.657
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:13.192
ADDED I THINK THAT WOULD BE A

01:57:13.259 --> 01:57:15.895
WONDERFUL IDEA SO THAT- THAT IT

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:19.465
IS. A FORM OF PAYING A DEBT TO

01:57:19.532 --> 01:57:21.501
THEIR CHILD BY. MAKING

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:23.636
THEMSELVES BETTER PARENTS BUT

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.705
THE BILL AS IT STANDS ALSO

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:27.106
WE'RE WE'RE STANDING SOMETHING

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.175
THAT SOMETHING THAT SUNSET SOON

01:57:29.242 --> 01:57:32.378
AND I APPRECIATE TO- IS CARILLO

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:32.979
YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK

01:57:33.045 --> 01:57:35.915
YOU. YOU HAVE N. BITS GONZALEZ

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:37.417
I JUST WANT TO KNOW TO YOU HAVE

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:39.152
BROUGHT THAT UP CONSISTENTLYIN

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:41.220
AND I THINK YOU ARE CORRECT.

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:43.556
AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:46.125
PUT A PROGRAM LIKE THAT. IN THE

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:48.694
PRISONS EFFECTIVELY I THINK

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:50.463
THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:51.931
SO THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD

01:57:51.998 --> 01:57:53.166
HAVE SOMETHING AT STAKE WHEN

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:54.333
GETTING THE BENEFIT AND I THINK

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.803
THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:57.403
RELIEVING THE ISSUE THE MISTER

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:59.005
KILEY BROUGHT UP. THAT WE'RE

01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:00.773
WE'RE NOT THEN JUST RELIEVING

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.909
TO RELIEVE BUT TRYING TO MAKE

01:58:02.975 --> 01:58:03.943
SURE THAT WE'RE FINDING A WAY

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.011
TO PUT THAT FAMILY BACK

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.946
TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT HE CAN.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.981
GET BACK TOGETHER. BUT WE HAVE

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:10.716
A LONG HISTORY OF PROGRAMS THAT

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:12.151
WE PUT IN PLACE LIKE THE BATTER

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:13.653
INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:15.288
STATE JUST. AREN'T REALLY

01:58:15.354 --> 01:58:17.390
WORKING. IN THE STATE AND IF WE

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:20.326

WHO RECENTLY PASSED INTO THE

LATINO CAUCUS I WAS ABLE TO

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:26.085
RECOGNIZE LAST YEAR WHO IS PART

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:27.587
OF THE NATIONAL COMBAT AT WORK

02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:30.523
IN A LEADER IN MY COMMUNITY.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:32.458
POSSIBLE AND MISSION IS TO HELP

02:00:32.525 --> 02:00:34.493

TO THE FAMILIES TO BE GOOD

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:37.396
PARENTS AND ACTUALLY IN MY

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:39.432
COMMUNITY- ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS

MUST CONSOLIDATE TO WHAT YOU'RE

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:44.203
REFERRING TO- THAT IT

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:45.605
EFFECTIVELY TAUGHT A YOUNG MAN-

02:00:45.671 --> 02:00:48.174
HOW TO BE A GOOD FATHER. ARE IN

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.109
IF THEY WEREN'T FATHERS HOW TO

02:00:50.176 --> 02:00:52.244
BE GOOD MEN AND THEIR COMMUNITY

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:53.179
AND HOW TO BE GOOD AS BEEN GOOD

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.947
FATHERS IN FUTURE THE CHILL TO.

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:56.248
I THINK THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:57.617
PROGRAMS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY IF

02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:59.418
YOU COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:04.857
SUFFERING CREDIBLE. VIOLENCE OR

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:05.491
INCREDIBLE POVERTY AND

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:06.125
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:06.726
ON IN THE FUTURE THE I THINK

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:07.259
IT'S NECESSARY FOR THIS.

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:09.095
IMPRINT ADDING SOMETHING LIKE

02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:12.298
THAT- I THINK IN THIS PANDEMIC

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:13.833
THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY LIVING

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:14.834
ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE IT EVEN A

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.435
LITTLE BIT HARDER. BECAUSE THEN

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:17.436
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALLOCATE

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:19.305
FUNDS. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:21.474
CORRECTIONS. OR THE DEPARTMENT

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.808
OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR WHATEVER

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:24.777
ENTITY IT MAY BE. A TO

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.212
ESTABLISH PROGRAMS IN THE

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:27.713
PRISON SYSTEM THAT MAY ACTUALLY

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:29.048
NOT WORK ONCE PEOPLE ARE

02:01:29.115 --> 02:01:30.416
RELEASED. SO THAT PROGRAM I

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:32.585
THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. IF

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:33.986
ESTABLISHED ONCE WITHIN YOU

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:35.254
HAVE YOUR CHILD SUPPORT STUFF

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:37.056
VISITATION RIGHTS. TO THE YOUR

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:38.491
CALL CURRENTLY DOING SOMETHING

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:39.659
THAT ALLOWS FOR YOU TO LEARN

02:01:39.725 --> 02:01:42.294
OR- HOW TO BE A BETTER. UP

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:43.562
FAMILY INDIVIDUAL WHETHER

02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:45.998

REINTEGRATION BACK TO SOCIETY.

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.736
SO I SAY THAT ALL TO SAY THAT

02:01:50.803 --> 02:01:52.405
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE BEEN

02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:53.272
THINKING ABOUT AND HOW DO WE

02:01:53.339 --> 02:02:09.455
IMPROVE

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:21.834

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:40.952

03:12:45.820 --> 03:12:50.492

CRITICAL BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN

03:13:35.003 --> 03:13:37.439
ENORMOUS ABUSE IN THIS AREA AND

03:13:37.505 --> 03:13:39.240
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SAME

03:13:39.307 --> 03:13:41.710

03:35:34.388 --> 03:35:35.589
EXTENT THAT. WHEN YOU WERE

03:35:35.656 --> 03:35:36.923
SOMETHING ON AMAZON YOU CAN OF

03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:38.025
THINK OF IT GETTING FROM HIM

03:35:38.091 --> 03:35:40.193
RIVER OF THE- PARTICULAR COMP

03:35:40.260 --> 03:35:42.396
IS AND IT COMES IN THE- BY AND

03:35:42.462 --> 03:35:46.433
EVER BUT- YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER

03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:48.435
HAND I THINK. THE PURPOSE OF

03:35:48.502 --> 03:35:49.803
STRIP FRONT LIVE OR PRODUCT

03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:54.641
LINE LAW. IS NOT TO INCREASE

03:35:54.708 --> 03:35:57.577
CAUGHT. FOR VICTIMS TO MAKE IT

03:35:57.644 --> 03:35:59.846
SO THERE ARE FEWER SO THE WORK

03:35:59.913 --> 03:36:02.683
REDUCING THE COST OF. SO WHY

03:36:02.749 --> 03:36:03.417
WHAT'S THE MECHANISM BY WHICH

03:36:03.483 --> 03:36:06.853
IN ON LAW MARKET PLACE LIKE A

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:08.422
COMPANY LIKE THAT. IS WELL

03:36:08.488 --> 03:36:11.291
SITUATED TO MINIMIZE ACOSTA

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:15.095
ACCIDENTS. SURE THEN THAT'S A

03:36:15.162 --> 03:36:18.265
GREAT. AND REALLY THIS IS WHAT

03:36:18.332 --> 03:36:18.932
UNDERLIES THE NEED FOR THE BILL

03:36:18.999 --> 03:36:21.501
IS THERE THERE ARE. RETAIL

03:36:21.568 --> 03:36:22.269
RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE CREE IN

03:36:22.336 --> 03:36:24.471
A WAY THAT WHEN THE I. LAW WERE

03:36:24.538 --> 03:36:27.107
PASSED IN WHEN WE BUILT UP

03:36:27.174 --> 03:36:29.910
CONSUMER LAWS OVER THE YEARS.

03:36:29.976 --> 03:36:32.379
DID NOT CONTEMPLATE THE KIND OF

03:36:32.446 --> 03:36:34.448
FUNCTIONS THAT THERE ARE NOW.

03:36:34.514 --> 03:36:36.116
THE DISTRAUGHT THIS PLACE SO IT

03:36:36.183 --> 03:36:38.218
WAS ON IS IT IS A GOOD. GOOD

03:36:38.285 --> 03:36:40.087
CASE AND THEY A TREMENDOUS OF

03:36:40.153 --> 03:36:42.522
POWER IN THE MARKETPLACE IN THE

03:36:42.589 --> 03:36:44.024
INDUSTRY AND WITH THEIR

03:36:44.091 --> 03:36:46.593
VENDORS. AND BECAUSE SOME OF

03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:47.694
THEIR VENDORS LIKE IN THE CASE

03:36:47.761 --> 03:36:49.196
OF THE HOVER BOARD THE PERSON

03:36:49.262 --> 03:36:50.497
FLANK TO BURN DOWN THAT THE

03:36:50.564 --> 03:36:53.900
POOR MAN'S HOUSE. THEY HAVE THE

03:36:53.967 --> 03:36:55.268
ABILITY. TO IN FOR. WITH THEIR

03:36:55.335 --> 03:36:58.538
VENDOR. PRODUCT QUALITY AND IT

03:36:58.605 --> 03:37:00.974
IN WAYS THAT NOBODY ELSE COULD.

03:37:01.041 --> 03:37:02.709
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A

03:37:02.776 --> 03:37:03.610
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

03:37:03.677 --> 03:37:06.279
MANUFACTURERS. AND RECORD

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:08.515
MORTAR. RETAILERS WHO ARE

TYPICALLY. ON WINE SHOULD

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:13.820
SOMETHING GO WRONG. BECAUSE NOW

03:37:13.887 --> 03:37:16.056
WE HAVE OPENED UP POSSIBILITIES

03:37:16.123 --> 03:37:18.492
IN THIS NEW. ELECTRONIC ONLINE

03:37:18.558 --> 03:37:21.061
BROWN FOR. RELATIONSHIPS TO GO

03:37:21.128 --> 03:37:23.463
WELL BEYOND WHAT CALIFORNIA'S

03:37:23.530 --> 03:37:25.065
LONG ARM STATUTES COULD EVER

03:37:25.132 --> 03:37:27.300
REACH. IN THE CASE OF THE- OF

03:37:27.367 --> 03:37:29.169
WHERE TO GET A GOOD CASE. STAY

03:37:29.236 --> 03:37:31.471
ON THIS BECAUSE THAT COMPANY

03:37:31.538 --> 03:37:36.042
WAS REACHABLE. NOKNOWS WHO

03:37:36.109 --> 03:37:38.145
THEY ARE REALLY WHERE THERE LOW.

03:37:38.211 --> 03:37:39.212
AND THE ONLY ONE WHO DO. IT THE

03:37:39.279 --> 03:37:41.148
ONLINE MARKETPLACES TATER HOOK

03:37:41.214 --> 03:37:44.284
SET RULES FOR PARTICIPATION IN

03:37:44.351 --> 03:37:45.852
THAT MARKET PLACE AND IF

03:37:45.919 --> 03:37:47.921
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WHICH THEY

03:37:47.988 --> 03:37:49.256
DON'T SEEM WILLING TO DO THAT

03:37:49.322 --> 03:37:52.325
HOW ELSE DO REMEDY THE HARM IN

03:37:52.392 --> 03:37:55.662
THIS SITUATION SO TO YOUR POINT.

03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:56.863
IF WE'RE GOING TO RATED

03:37:56.930 --> 03:38:00.834
SENATORS. TO THAT THE IN FUSION

03:38:00.901 --> 03:38:04.371
SO. IS PLAYING THE WAY THAT THE

03:38:04.438 --> 03:38:06.173
PRICE WORKS WE THINK OF THE

03:38:06.239 --> 03:38:06.973
BREAKING AND THE NORMAL

03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:08.508
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IF WE'RE

03:38:08.575 --> 03:38:11.044
GONNA CREATE AS SENT WE WILL

03:38:11.111 --> 03:38:13.280
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE

03:38:13.346 --> 03:38:15.081
OPERATING IN A PLAY. WHO HAVE

03:38:15.148 --> 03:38:20.987
THE ABILITY TO SET. THERE IS

03:38:21.054 --> 03:38:24.658
ONE TO PROTECT THAT FOR THE END

03:38:24.724 --> 03:38:27.994
TO GO. THAT'S WHERE WE- THEM.

03:38:28.061 --> 03:38:29.996
TO BE MORE RESEARCH. TO WHOSE

03:38:30.063 --> 03:38:30.730
UP THROUGH THE MARK PLACE YEAH

03:38:30.797 --> 03:38:33.033
WE COULD HAVE PEARL. GO AND

03:38:33.099 --> 03:38:34.067
CHEAP GOOD THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

03:38:34.134 --> 03:38:36.870
THE- YES CONSUMER WANT ACCESS

03:38:36.937 --> 03:38:38.505
TO THE TO THE- AW AND- THE-

03:38:38.572 --> 03:38:40.640
PRODUCT BUT THEY ALSO. THIS DAY

03:38:40.707 --> 03:38:42.375
AND AGE EXPECT A CERTAIN OF

03:38:42.442 --> 03:38:44.110
SAFETY IN THAT. WELL BECAUSE OF

03:38:44.177 --> 03:38:46.279
THESE TWO IS MY- THAT ARE OUT

03:38:46.346 --> 03:38:50.050
THERE THAT EXT. IS A FIFTY. IS

03:38:50.116 --> 03:38:51.651
REALLY LONGER THE AND I THINK

03:38:51.718 --> 03:38:54.321
THE COW. PUBLIC OTHER REALLY

03:38:54.387 --> 03:38:57.123
UNDER THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN.

03:38:57.190 --> 03:39:03.063
USE. TO SECTIONS SO MANY YEARS

03:39:03.129 --> 03:39:04.731
THEY HAVE THAT BASE SPEC

03:39:04.798 --> 03:39:05.832
TENSION. SO THIS IS THE WAY TO

03:39:05.899 --> 03:39:08.935
TRY AND MAKE FOR THAT. ALL OF

03:39:09.002 --> 03:39:11.104
THE WHO ARE GOING TO BE. SILLY

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:12.472
KADING BRINGING PRADA IN

03:39:12.539 --> 03:39:14.007
CALIFORNIA TAKERS. FOR THE SAY

03:39:14.074 --> 03:39:17.410
OF THOSE PRODUCTS. I DO TO THAT

03:39:17.477 --> 03:39:19.446
POINT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IS. WE

03:39:19.513 --> 03:39:21.781
AND YOU DEALING AN ONLINE. WITH

03:39:21.848 --> 03:39:23.416
DON'T HAVE. PHYSICAL OF THE

03:39:23.483 --> 03:39:24.851
PRODUCT ANY FOR IS A-

03:39:24.918 --> 03:39:25.685
RELATIONSHIP THE STREAM OF

03:39:25.752 --> 03:39:28.355
COMMERCE. THERE'S OF IN A BILL

03:39:28.421 --> 03:39:29.756

03:39:29.823 --> 03:39:31.525
BE MORE AN INNINGS SO REQUIRE

03:39:31.591 --> 03:39:36.296
MUCH OF. MARGIN BUFFER SO THIS

03:39:36.363 --> 03:39:37.364
WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTS

03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:40.500
AREN'T SOME INTO HOT IN THAT

03:39:40.567 --> 03:39:42.536

MORE. OR CALL RICA. BUT

03:39:55.348 --> 03:40:00.921

SOMETHING HAD A RETAIL STORE

03:40:05.158 --> 03:40:05.625
THEY CARRY ALL OF THAT OUR

03:40:05.692 --> 03:40:07.527
PUBLIC THAT'S BILL TO THE PRICE

03:40:32.252 --> 03:40:33.753
OPPOSITION CORRECT THIS IS A

03:40:33.820 --> 03:40:35.889

THEIR THEIR- THAT'S UP. WE TRY

03:41:59.272 --> 03:42:07.013
TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE AWAY.

03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:08.214
TO POTENTIALLY ABOUT THAT BUT-

03:42:08.281 --> 03:42:10.717

03:44:01.561 --> 03:44:03.163
THAT'S EVEN FACT RIGHT I MEAN

03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:06.366
THERE'S STILL ON HOLD ACTUALLY.

03:44:06.432 --> 03:44:11.504
SO I CHECKED YEAH. UP NOW I AM.

03:44:11.571 --> 03:44:14.340
INTERESTED IN THE OF THE AT. US

03:44:14.407 --> 03:44:18.845
IS AS OPPOSED TO STRICTLY. OUR

03:44:18.912 --> 03:44:22.549
HEY I DO ANY FACT THAT YOU KNOW

03:44:22.615 --> 03:44:26.319
THE PRODUCT LIABILITY. I LOVE

03:44:26.386 --> 03:44:27.687
THE COMPANY THAT HAS YOU KNOW

03:44:27.754 --> 03:44:29.122
THE BIG BUCKS I GUESS YOU KNOW

03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:32.425
SO I THINK IT MAY MAKE SENSE

03:44:32.492 --> 03:44:34.360
FOR US TO KIND OF ALLOCATE THE-

03:44:34.427 --> 03:44:40.333
THE- OF. OF THE I MEAN- ALL

03:44:40.400 --> 03:44:41.835
COMPANIES DIFFERENT COMPANIES

03:44:41.901 --> 03:44:44.270
RESPONSIBLE FOR- FOR THE TO

03:44:44.337 --> 03:44:45.772
HARM WITH THEM IS DONE I THINK

03:44:45.839 --> 03:44:47.774
YOU KNOW IN A SENSE IT KIND OF

03:44:47.841 --> 03:44:49.576
MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT BUT YOU

03:44:49.642 --> 03:44:52.278
KNOW I'M I'M I'M- WELL YEAH BUT

03:44:52.345 --> 03:44:53.346
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHICH IS.

03:44:53.413 --> 03:44:55.248
THE WHOLE REASON THE PRODUCTS I

03:44:55.315 --> 03:44:57.951
DISTRICT BY ABILITY IS BECAUSE

03:44:58.017 --> 03:44:59.853
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IS ALL

03:44:59.919 --> 03:45:01.855
OFTEN. UNDERSTAND IT ESPECIALLY

03:45:01.921 --> 03:45:03.890
WHEN. YOU YOU'RE LOOKING AT A

03:45:03.957 --> 03:45:06.025
DISTRIBUTION CHAIN HAD A

03:45:06.092 --> 03:45:08.161
PRODUCT MOVING THROUGH THAT AND

03:45:08.228 --> 03:45:10.730
SO. A COMPANY EIGHT. IS

03:45:10.797 --> 03:45:11.931
DISTRIBUTING A PRODUCT INTO THE

03:45:11.998 --> 03:45:13.132
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH AN

03:45:13.199 --> 03:45:14.367
ONLINE MARKETPLACE AND THEY'RE

03:45:14.434 --> 03:45:16.970
THE ONLY. ORGANIZATION THAT HAS

03:45:17.036 --> 03:45:18.371
ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

03:45:18.438 --> 03:45:19.372
MANUFACTURER AND THAT

03:45:19.439 --> 03:45:21.107
MANUFACTURE AS IS THE CASE WITH

03:45:21.174 --> 03:45:22.508
TALK ABOUT IS OUTSIDE OF THE

03:45:22.575 --> 03:45:25.078
REACH OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WHAT'S

03:45:25.144 --> 03:45:27.046
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD ONCE

03:45:27.113 --> 03:45:29.916
WHEN THEY DIDN'T MANUFACTURER

03:45:29.983 --> 03:45:31.217
EIGHT THEY THEY DIDN'T TOUCH IT

03:45:31.284 --> 03:45:33.086
THEY DIDN'T SORT OF. HANDLE

03:45:33.152 --> 03:45:36.222
THAT PRODUCT SO. THAT I GUESS

03:45:36.289 --> 03:45:37.724
I'M OPEN TO THE CONCEPT BUT I'M

03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:38.825
NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT

03:45:38.892 --> 03:45:40.660
FUNCTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT A

03:45:40.727 --> 03:45:41.494
PRODUCTS LIABILITY IS

03:45:41.561 --> 03:45:42.462
ESSENTIALLY STRICT LIABILITY

03:45:42.528 --> 03:45:44.631
BECAUSE- WE DON'T. IF WE'RE

03:45:44.697 --> 03:45:45.965
GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO

03:45:46.032 --> 03:45:48.301
WERE INJURED. IN THE IF WE

03:45:48.368 --> 03:45:50.703
START DOWN INTO THAT NEGLIGENCE

03:45:50.770 --> 03:45:54.707
QUESTION IT BECOMES DIFFICULT

03:45:54.774 --> 03:45:56.242
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE- WHAT

03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:57.510
THE VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS ARE

03:45:57.577 --> 03:45:58.811
IN IN WHAT THE VARIOUS

03:45:58.878 --> 03:46:00.580
LIABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE. WE

03:46:00.647 --> 03:46:02.682
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

03:46:02.749 --> 03:46:05.418
MANUFACTURERS. DISTRIBUTORS

03:46:05.485 --> 03:46:07.287
BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THAT IN

03:46:07.353 --> 03:46:09.055
THIS CASE TRANSLATE THIS TRY TO

03:46:09.122 --> 03:46:10.723
TRANSLATE THIS INTO THE ON

03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:12.392

ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE

03:46:14.894 --> 03:46:16.896
SAFE AND ARE NOT GOING TO HARM

03:46:16.963 --> 03:46:17.931
PEOPLE AND THAT WAS

03:46:17.997 --> 03:46:19.465
CALIFORNIANS MOVE MORE TO THE

03:46:19.532 --> 03:46:21.034
ONLINE ROOM I THINK THAT'S

03:46:21.100 --> 03:46:21.868
WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS

03:46:21.935 --> 03:46:23.770
CONVERSATION. TO LOOK AT THAT

03:46:23.836 --> 03:46:26.205

PRODUCT SAFETY AT THE SAME

03:46:30.009 --> 03:46:31.811
INCENTIVES FOR MANUFACTURERS

03:46:31.878 --> 03:46:32.512
AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE

03:46:32.578 --> 03:46:35.348
RESPONSIBLE UP THE CHAIN. EXIST

03:46:35.415 --> 03:46:37.483
SO THAT WE'RE NOT NOW BRINGING

03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:39.452
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF. LOW COST

03:46:39.519 --> 03:46:41.988

YOU KNOW I FEEL KIND OF FEEL

03:47:44.450 --> 03:47:46.319
LIKE WE AS WE TALK ABOUT BOTTOM

03:47:46.386 --> 03:47:49.422
LINE COMMERCE AND THE GIG

03:47:49.489 --> 03:47:52.058
ECONOMY THAT WE WANT TO SOME

03:47:52.125 --> 03:47:53.760
WAY SOMETIMES MAKE IT LIKE A

03:47:53.826 --> 03:47:54.927
BRICK AND MORTAR MAKE IT LOOK

03:47:54.994 --> 03:47:56.763
LIKE BROKEN OR BUT IT'S NOT IT

03:47:56.829 --> 03:47:57.530
IS A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

03:47:57.597 --> 03:47:59.632
MECHANIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

03:47:59.699 --> 03:48:00.800
INTERESTING SITUATION HERE

03:48:00.867 --> 03:48:03.403
WHERE. A MARKET PLACE IS

03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:04.537
FUNCTIONING AS A CONDUIT

03:48:04.604 --> 03:48:05.772
BETWEEN WILLING BUYERS ARE

03:48:05.838 --> 03:48:07.140
WILLING SELLERS AND THAT

03:48:07.206 --> 03:48:08.875
PHYSICAL MATERIAL NEVER PASSED

03:48:08.941 --> 03:48:11.310
THROUGH THE CHAIN OF POSSESSION

03:48:11.377 --> 03:48:13.513
OF THE MARKETPLACE ITSELF SO I

03:48:13.579 --> 03:48:14.914
MEAN IT REALLY ISN'T LIKE AN

03:48:14.981 --> 03:48:16.916
ONLINE RETAILER WE AND THIS

03:48:16.983 --> 03:48:18.317
BILL IS KIND OF REPORTING TO

03:48:18.384 --> 03:48:22.488
TREAT IT LIKE AN ONLINE RETAIL.

03:48:22.555 --> 03:48:23.723
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A BIGGER

03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:24.957
CONCERN THAT I HAVE THAT WHICH

03:48:25.024 --> 03:48:26.659
IS THAT. YOU KNOW IN IN THIS

03:48:26.726 --> 03:48:28.094
CASE IN IN THE TESTIMONY WAS

03:48:28.161 --> 03:48:30.296
JUST COMPELLING. ABOUT THE

03:48:30.363 --> 03:48:31.364
FORTUNATE WITH THE LOST HIS

03:48:31.431 --> 03:48:34.033
HOME I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S

03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:34.967
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S-

03:48:35.034 --> 03:48:36.669
IT'S EASY TO FIND TO IMAGINE

03:48:36.736 --> 03:48:37.970
WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO LOSE

03:48:38.037 --> 03:48:39.739
YOUR HOME THAT WAY. AND CLEARLY

03:48:39.806 --> 03:48:40.873
IT WAS AS A RESULT OF A

03:48:40.940 --> 03:48:42.542
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BUT- WE HAVE

03:48:42.608 --> 03:48:43.943
NOT TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

03:48:44.010 --> 03:48:46.512
AMAZON ACTUALLY. WAS NEGLIGENT

03:48:46.579 --> 03:48:47.814
IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS

03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:50.850
BUT- ITS CLEAR THAT IF YOU

03:48:50.917 --> 03:48:52.485
HAVE AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE.

03:48:52.552 --> 03:48:55.788
EVEN IF. YOU HAD A FULL TIME

03:48:55.855 --> 03:48:59.225
STAFF DEDICATED TO- TO TRYING

03:48:59.292 --> 03:49:00.326
TO ENSURE THAT USUALLY SHIP A

03:49:00.393 --> 03:49:02.161
QUALITY PRODUCT. EVEN IF YOU

03:49:02.228 --> 03:49:03.229
DID EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD

03:49:03.296 --> 03:49:04.764
POSSIBLY DO TRYING TO AVOID THE

03:49:04.831 --> 03:49:07.066
SITUATIONS THAT PERIODICALLY

03:49:07.133 --> 03:49:07.900
UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING LIKE

03:49:07.967 --> 03:49:10.803
THIS WOULD HAPPEN. SO I MEAN I

03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:11.871
THINK IT'S CLEAR THE DID YOU

03:49:11.938 --> 03:49:13.106
KNOW THIS IS GOING TO RAISE

03:49:13.172 --> 03:49:14.774
COSTS FOR CONSUMERS IN

03:49:14.841 --> 03:49:16.075
CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO WAY. THEY

03:49:16.142 --> 03:49:18.878
COULD. HE QUESTION. THAT WE IS

03:49:18.945 --> 03:49:20.880
WHETHER OR NOT. THE AMOUNT THAT

03:49:20.947 --> 03:49:22.582
WE RAISE THE STRAW IS WORTH THE

03:49:22.648 --> 03:49:24.383
PUBLIC. BENEFIT THAT WOULD

03:49:24.450 --> 03:49:25.751
RESULT IS WRITTEN. FOR RAISING

03:49:25.818 --> 03:49:28.121
THOSE COSTS- AND I ALSO WANT TO

03:49:28.187 --> 03:49:29.522
SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT THE

03:49:29.589 --> 03:49:31.124
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING

03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:33.059
ABOUT ON AMAZON. YOU KNOW ABOUT

03:49:33.126 --> 03:49:34.093
HOW THEY'RE THEY HAVE THIS

03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:36.662
MARKET. YES IN THIS BILL AND

03:49:36.729 --> 03:49:37.463
THIS IS WHAT I LIKE YOUR

03:49:37.530 --> 03:49:38.865
REACTION TO- I THINK THE

03:49:38.931 --> 03:49:40.333
PASSING THIS BILL WOULD MAKE

03:49:40.399 --> 03:49:43.202
THAT DOMINANCE- EVEN WORSE.

03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:44.937
REASON IS BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE

03:49:45.004 --> 03:49:46.038
PUT RESTRICTIONS ON A FREE

03:49:46.105 --> 03:49:47.974
MARKET WE RAISE THE BARRIER TO

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:49.942
ENTRY. TO COMPANIES THAT WISH

03:49:50.009 --> 03:49:51.110
TO ENTER THAT MARKET IN IN IN

03:49:51.177 --> 03:49:53.045
CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL BECAME

03:49:53.112 --> 03:49:55.781
LAW- I WOULD THINK THAT WE ARE.

03:49:55.848 --> 03:49:57.350
TELLING EVERYBODY THE ONLY WAY

03:49:57.416 --> 03:49:59.152
THAT YOU CAN OPEN AN ONLINE

03:49:59.218 --> 03:50:00.520
MARKET MARKET PLACE IN

03:50:00.586 --> 03:50:03.756
CALIFORNIA IS IF YOU HAVE A

03:50:03.823 --> 03:50:06.192
BUNCH OF ONE OF THE INSURANCE

03:50:06.259 --> 03:50:06.792
AND IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL.

03:50:06.859 --> 03:50:10.796
STAFF SINGLE PRODUCT THAT YOU.

03:50:10.863 --> 03:50:11.564
IT IS THAT WILL SAYING IS IT'S

03:50:11.631 --> 03:50:13.599
SURE SEEMS LIKE THAT'S WHAT

03:50:13.666 --> 03:50:15.935
WE'RE SAYING WITH THIS BILL

03:50:16.002 --> 03:50:20.773
WELL TO IT TO YOUR FIRST POINT

03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:21.274
ABOUT THE NEGLIGENCE OF

03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:22.208
SURVEILLANCE. I THINK. I

03:50:22.275 --> 03:50:24.043
BELIEVE STREET LEVEL. SOME OF

03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:25.778
THE THOSE QUESTIONS TO YOUR

03:50:25.845 --> 03:50:27.480
SECOND ONE I THINK A LOT OF

03:50:27.547 --> 03:50:29.282
THAT SHIP IS ALREADY SAILED

03:50:29.348 --> 03:50:32.018
THAT GIVEN AMAZON'S DOMINANCE

03:50:32.084 --> 03:50:36.422
IN THE MARKETPLACE THEIR 50% OF

03:50:36.489 --> 03:50:38.257
ON LINE RETAIL NOW SOMEBODY WHO

03:50:38.324 --> 03:50:42.128
IS A- A PLACE TO IS SELLING ON

03:50:42.195 --> 03:50:43.963
SELLING THEIR PRODUCT ONLINE

03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:45.431
THERE'S BUDGET THEY'RE SELLING

03:50:45.498 --> 03:50:47.700
ONLINE DOESN'T GET THEM OUT OF

03:50:47.767 --> 03:50:50.069
ANY OF THAT THE LIABILITY THAT

03:50:50.136 --> 03:50:52.438
THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN.

03:50:52.505 --> 03:50:54.240
WE'RE NOT REALLY EVEN WATCHING.

03:50:54.307 --> 03:50:56.842
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. APPLYING A

03:50:56.909 --> 03:51:00.012
SENSE OF. LIABILITY PRODUCTS

03:51:00.079 --> 03:51:02.915
LIABILITY. IN A WAY THAT

03:51:02.982 --> 03:51:04.450
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ALREADY

03:51:04.517 --> 03:51:06.319
UNDERSTAND AND THE PROTECTIONS

03:51:06.385 --> 03:51:08.821
THAT THEY GET INTO ONLINE BROWN

03:51:08.888 --> 03:51:10.489
THAT SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO

03:51:10.556 --> 03:51:12.992
SKIRT THAT LIABILITY AND THOSE

03:51:13.059 --> 03:51:15.194
OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THE

03:51:15.261 --> 03:51:16.529
ARGUMENT IS THEY DO BUSINESS

03:51:16.596 --> 03:51:18.898
DIFFERENTLY THEY'RE JUST MERELY

03:51:18.965 --> 03:51:20.233
FACILITATING THE THAT

03:51:20.299 --> 03:51:21.968
TRANSACTION BUT YEAH TYPICALLY

03:51:22.034 --> 03:51:26.706
THE ONES WHO HAVE THE BEST IN

03:51:26.772 --> 03:51:30.810
THE STRONGEST. ABILITY TO. SAVE

03:51:30.876 --> 03:51:32.912
NOT. INTO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET

03:51:32.979 --> 03:51:34.447
SO FOR THEM TO STEP BACK AND

03:51:34.513 --> 03:51:35.982
SAY LOOK WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

03:51:36.048 --> 03:51:37.516
ESPECIALLY COMPANIES LIKE

03:51:37.583 --> 03:51:39.151
AMAZON WHICH IS TRYING TO.

03:51:39.218 --> 03:51:41.053
FACILITATE WILLING BUYERS AND

03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:43.256
WILLING SELLERS AND YET GIVEN

03:51:43.322 --> 03:51:45.491
THEIR MARKET SHARE GIVEN THE

03:51:45.558 --> 03:51:47.660
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY MAKE

03:51:47.727 --> 03:51:48.594
ON ALL OF THESE TRANSACTIONS

03:51:48.661 --> 03:51:50.229
THEY'RE OPENING UP THE

03:51:50.296 --> 03:51:52.131
FLOODGATES OF DANGEROUS

03:51:52.198 --> 03:51:53.499
PRODUCTS COMING IN THE

03:51:53.566 --> 03:51:55.801
CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR PAR

03:51:55.868 --> 03:51:59.071
ABILITY TO HAVE ANY SAY OR TO

03:51:59.138 --> 03:52:02.241
DO WITH THAT. WITH ANY REMEDY

03:52:02.308 --> 03:52:03.809
SHOULD SOMEONE BE INJURED SO I

03:52:03.876 --> 03:52:05.611
THINK YES WE'RE NOT EXACTLY

03:52:05.678 --> 03:52:07.079
TRYING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO

03:52:07.146 --> 03:52:09.849
TREAT BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME BUT

03:52:09.915 --> 03:52:10.916
WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THESE

03:52:10.983 --> 03:52:13.753
KINDS. AN EMPLOYMENT ONLINE

03:52:13.819 --> 03:52:15.955
BROWN IN AN ONLINE WORLD THAT

03:52:16.022 --> 03:52:17.523
HE IS. FUNCTIONING HE'S VERY

03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:19.458
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ECONOMY

03:52:19.525 --> 03:52:21.060
CALIFORNIA SUPPORT TO THE WAY

03:52:21.127 --> 03:52:23.396
CONSUMERS GET PRODUCTS BUT IS

03:52:23.462 --> 03:52:26.265
LEAVING THOSE CONSUMERS. VERY

03:52:26.332 --> 03:52:28.501
VULNERABLE TO INJURIES WITHOUT

03:52:28.567 --> 03:52:31.671
RENDON SO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:52:31.737 --> 03:52:33.873
WE'RE CRAZINESS REMEDIES GIVEN

03:52:33.939 --> 03:52:37.677
THEN THE CHANGING NATURE OF HOW

03:52:37.743 --> 03:52:39.145
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE

03:52:39.211 --> 03:52:40.780
EXPECTING TO ACQUIRE THEIR

03:52:40.846 --> 03:52:42.348
PROBLEM SO WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE

03:52:42.415 --> 03:52:43.783
SITUATION YOU JUST TALK ABOUT

03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:46.085
WHERE- YOU'VE GOT AN ONLINE

03:52:46.152 --> 03:52:47.787
MARKETPLACE BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT

03:52:47.853 --> 03:52:48.921
THE MARKET PLACE IS JUST A

03:52:48.988 --> 03:52:50.890
CONDO. FOR A RELATIONSHIP TO

03:52:50.956 --> 03:52:53.526
LINK UP OF OUR BEST SELLERS. I

03:52:53.592 --> 03:52:54.694
MEAN IN ADDITION TO THE FACT

03:52:54.760 --> 03:52:55.861
THAT THERE'S NO CHANGE IN

03:52:55.928 --> 03:52:57.396
POSSESSION OF THE GOOD IS BEING

03:52:57.463 --> 03:52:58.864
SHIPPED THE MARKET PLACES

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:00.132
EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT HEY LOOK

03:53:00.199 --> 03:53:01.467
WE'RE JUST MATCHING YOU GUYS

03:53:01.534 --> 03:53:02.702
UP. IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR BILL

03:53:02.768 --> 03:53:04.437
DOES NOT MAKE IT CAPTION FOR

03:53:04.503 --> 03:53:05.004
THAT I DON'T REALLY SHOW IT

03:53:05.071 --> 03:53:06.605
DOESN'T BECAUSE THE SITUATION

03:53:06.672 --> 03:53:08.307
THAT WE'RE SEEING ESPECIALLY

03:53:08.374 --> 03:53:10.176
WITH LARGER ONES. THAT HAVE THE

03:53:10.242 --> 03:53:12.244
ABILITY TO REACH FULLY AND TO

03:53:12.311 --> 03:53:14.246
REACH COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURE.

03:53:14.313 --> 03:53:16.282
WHO DON'T HAVE A CONTEXT

03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:18.651
CALIFORNIA. OR CALIFORNIA. FOR

03:53:18.718 --> 03:53:20.453
THAT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION

03:53:20.519 --> 03:53:22.521
LAWS THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

03:53:22.588 --> 03:53:24.890
REMEDY A WRONG IF THEY HAVE

03:53:24.957 --> 03:53:26.992
THAT ABILITY TO BRING A

03:53:27.059 --> 03:53:27.626
DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO

03:53:27.693 --> 03:53:30.529
CALIFORNIA. THEN YES THEY

03:53:30.596 --> 03:53:33.032
SHOULD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT

03:53:33.099 --> 03:53:36.569
THEY HAVE NOW PRODUCED A DANGER.

03:53:36.635 --> 03:53:39.538
FOR WITHOUT ROAMING. OKAY WELL

03:53:39.605 --> 03:53:40.039
LET ME THAT THIS IS THIS

03:53:40.106 --> 03:53:40.940
ILLUSTRATE MY BIG WITH BILL

03:53:41.006 --> 03:53:42.575
THAT YOU KNOW THE IF YOU LOOK

03:53:42.641 --> 03:53:43.876
BACK ON ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

03:53:43.943 --> 03:53:45.378
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST

03:53:45.444 --> 03:53:47.213
YOU KNOW FOUND YEARS THAT HAVE

03:53:47.279 --> 03:53:48.481
POWER WELL THE INTERNET IS

03:53:48.547 --> 03:53:51.517
RIGHT UP THERE AND IT'S A POWER

03:53:51.584 --> 03:53:54.520
PEOPLE BECAUSE IT. THIS TRADE

03:53:54.587 --> 03:53:57.189
OF INFORMATION THAN. OURS AND

03:53:57.256 --> 03:53:58.424
TO TREAT IT LIKE. A BRICK AND

03:53:58.491 --> 03:54:01.327
MORTAR. TYPE OF TO. I THINK YOU

03:54:01.394 --> 03:54:02.828

03:54:02.895 --> 03:54:04.196
PURPLE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'VE

03:54:04.263 --> 03:54:05.564
ACHIEVED WITH WITH THAT FREE

03:54:05.631 --> 03:54:07.833
FLOW OF COMMERCE SO- I'LL BE

03:54:07.900 --> 03:54:10.369
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION YEAH AND

03:54:10.436 --> 03:54:12.338
THEN THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

03:54:12.405 --> 03:54:15.674
BUT IT'S BE BECAUSE- IT'S

03:54:15.741 --> 03:54:17.243
BECAUSE WE'RE RELYING MORE AND

03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:18.878
MORE ON IN THE INTERNET IT'S

03:54:18.944 --> 03:54:20.646
ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF AN EXCUSE

03:54:20.713 --> 03:54:21.781
TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH

03:54:21.847 --> 03:54:24.216

THIS IS THIS IS NEW IT'S

03:54:27.253 --> 03:54:29.121
INNOVATIVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

03:54:29.188 --> 03:54:32.825

03:54:32.892 --> 03:54:34.460
WHATEVER IN A CATEGORY YOU WANT

03:54:34.527 --> 03:54:36.395

03:54:36.462 --> 03:54:38.964
DON'T HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE WELL

03:54:39.031 --> 03:54:39.999
NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY

03:54:40.065 --> 03:54:41.867

03:54:41.934 --> 03:54:44.503
ACCOUNTABILITY THE LAW HAS GET

03:54:51.777 --> 03:54:54.246
RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND A PERSON

03:54:54.313 --> 03:54:57.283
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:58.651
INJURY IN THE IN FACT THAT THEY

03:54:58.717 --> 03:55:00.519
CREATED THAT RELATIONSHIP AND

03:55:00.586 --> 03:55:02.121
THEY ALLOW THAT PRODUCT TO GET

03:55:02.188 --> 03:55:05.024
SO WE HAVEN'T HAD QUESTION

03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:06.926

04:45:18.634 --> 04:45:21.804
ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES OF BIAS I'M-

04:45:21.871 --> 04:45:25.041

OR THE POSITION OF DOCTOR WEBER

04:45:29.512 --> 04:45:31.214
I THINK- FLIES IN THE FACE OF

04:45:31.280 --> 04:45:32.482
COUNTLESS STUDIES. THAT CLEARLY

04:45:32.548 --> 04:45:34.116
DEMONSTRATE BIAS RADICAL JUST

04:45:34.183 --> 04:45:36.853
SYSTEM AND SPECIFIC TO THE JURY

04:45:36.919 --> 04:45:38.321
SELECTION PROCESS. I'M

04:45:38.387 --> 04:45:40.556
CERTAINLY SEEN IT FIRST HAND IT

04:45:40.623 --> 04:45:42.525
WAS ALMOST LIKE A BIGGER JOKE

04:45:42.592 --> 04:45:44.327
TO HAVE TO DO ABOUT HER HEARING

04:45:44.393 --> 04:45:45.261
COULD YOU KNEW YOU WOULD NOT

04:45:45.328 --> 04:45:46.896
GET A GRANTED. AND THAT ON

04:45:46.963 --> 04:45:48.831
APPEAL IT WOULD NOT BE A

04:45:48.898 --> 04:45:50.800
GRANTED EVEN THOUGH- THEIR

04:45:50.867 --> 04:45:55.238
EXPLICIT EXAMPLES OF BIAS IN

04:45:55.304 --> 04:45:57.106
TERMS OF ROOTING OUT PEOPLE OF

04:45:57.173 --> 04:46:01.010
COLOR. PRINTER. WE KNOW THE

04:46:01.077 --> 04:46:02.845
BATON WE HERE TO PROCESS

04:46:02.912 --> 04:46:05.281
DOESN'T WERE TO WITHOUT RACIAL.

04:46:05.348 --> 04:46:06.782
IN THE JURY SELECTION AND

04:46:06.849 --> 04:46:09.418
SUGGEST IT DOES PLEASANT FACE

04:46:09.485 --> 04:46:11.654
THE FACTS OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR

04:46:11.721 --> 04:46:12.822
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND

04:46:12.889 --> 04:46:16.659
YOU KNOW WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT

04:46:16.726 --> 04:46:19.028
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS-

04:46:19.095 --> 04:46:21.464
DIRECTION IT THAT IT RECOGNIZES

04:46:21.531 --> 04:46:22.798
IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS

04:46:22.865 --> 04:46:24.567
SOMETHING THAT WE I THINK I WAS

04:46:24.634 --> 04:46:26.135
A BODY OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

04:46:26.202 --> 04:46:27.970
HAVE FINALLY STARTED TO MOVE IN

04:46:28.037 --> 04:46:30.139
THE DIRECTION ACROSS MANY

04:46:30.206 --> 04:46:31.874
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. THE

04:46:31.941 --> 04:46:33.809
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS

04:46:33.876 --> 04:46:35.645
PROBABLY ONE THAT HAS MORE.

04:46:35.711 --> 04:46:37.847
IMPACTS FROM BIAS THAN PRETTY

04:46:37.914 --> 04:46:40.383
MUCH ANY OTHER INDUSTRY I CAN

04:46:40.449 --> 04:46:43.486
THINK OF IN OUR SOCIETY- AND IT

04:46:43.553 --> 04:46:46.055
USES FACIALLY NEUTRAL REASONS-

04:46:46.122 --> 04:46:47.456
THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

04:46:47.523 --> 04:46:49.358
ASSOCIATED. WITH PROTECTED

04:46:49.425 --> 04:46:52.929
GROUPS. AND IT INTENTIONALLY

04:46:52.995 --> 04:46:54.597
THAT PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE

04:46:54.664 --> 04:46:56.032
PARTY EXERCISING. THE

04:46:56.098 --> 04:46:58.334
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. THE

04:46:58.401 --> 04:47:01.103
CURRENT PROCESS PASSED. A JUDGE

04:47:01.170 --> 04:47:02.838
DETERMINED THE STATE OF MIND OF

04:47:02.905 --> 04:47:05.041

IMPLICIT BIAS THAT EXIST IN OUR

04:47:48.351 --> 04:47:51.354
SOCIETY. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY

04:47:51.420 --> 04:47:53.823
JUROR HAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

04:47:53.889 --> 04:47:57.627

CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE WITH LAW

TRUE JURY OF ONE'S PEERS. TO BE

04:48:32.595 --> 04:48:33.663
ABLE TO BE A AS A JURY INCOME

04:48:33.729 --> 04:48:35.631
OF QUE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

04:48:35.698 --> 04:48:37.133
THAT THE JURORS THAT ARE BEING

04:48:37.199 --> 04:48:39.402
SEATED HAVE A CROSS SECTION OF.

04:48:39.468 --> 04:48:42.038
THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE AND SO

04:48:42.104 --> 04:48:43.472
THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT THIS

04:48:43.539 --> 04:48:46.509
BILL IS SO IMPORTANT IT IS AND

04:48:46.575 --> 04:48:49.378
WOULD BE. A THE SHIFT BUT IT'S

04:48:49.445 --> 04:48:51.313
A SHIFT OF BASED UPON. THE

04:48:51.380 --> 04:48:52.848
SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT OUR

04:48:52.915 --> 04:48:55.785
SOCIETY HAS HAD SINCE ITS

04:48:55.851 --> 04:48:58.387
INCEPTION. SINCE THE CONCLUSION

04:48:58.454 --> 04:49:00.022
OF SLAVERY WE'VE SEEN COME THE

04:49:00.089 --> 04:49:01.691
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS

04:49:01.757 --> 04:49:04.894
CONTINUED THE RACIAL ANIMUS-

04:49:04.960 --> 04:49:07.530

SEE YOUR- ON THE BECAUSE OF THE-

04:49:14.570 --> 04:49:16.439
BUT THE DA AND THE PUBLIC

04:49:16.505 --> 04:49:17.740
DEFENDER'S THE JUDGES HAVE TO

04:49:17.807 --> 04:49:20.209
BE THE SOLUTION. AND IN BEING

04:49:20.276 --> 04:49:21.744
EXPLICIT AND MOVING OUT THIS

04:49:21.811 --> 04:49:24.680
RACISM AND SO- THAT'S WHY I

04:49:24.747 --> 04:49:26.048
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

04:49:26.115 --> 04:49:29.285
HOPE. THAT WE CAN. MOVE IT FOR

04:49:29.351 --> 04:49:32.655
TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK IT.

04:49:32.722 --> 04:49:34.790

04:49:34.857 --> 04:49:35.591
ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING EXTRA

04:49:35.658 --> 04:49:37.059
ABOUT ROOTING OUT RACISM

04:49:37.126 --> 04:49:39.762
PROBLEM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.

04:53:31.360 --> 04:53:34.129
OUT. OF THAT WOULD. I'M

04:53:34.196 --> 04:53:35.497
INTERESTED IN. IN IT SO THERE'S

04:53:35.564 --> 04:53:37.366
BY THAT IN THE YEAR THAT ARE

04:53:37.433 --> 04:53:38.968
BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM NOW WE

04:53:39.034 --> 04:53:40.602
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WHO BUILT THE

04:53:40.669 --> 04:53:43.505
SYSTEM FIRST OF ALL. AND WHAT

04:53:43.572 --> 04:53:44.873
THE SYSTEM IS TO. BEING OUT OF

04:53:44.940 --> 04:53:48.377
THE- OF THAT THEY MAY HAVE A

04:53:48.444 --> 04:53:49.345
HANSARD MAKES. AND THEREFORE

04:53:49.411 --> 04:53:51.880
MAY NOT BE MAYBE OPEN MINDED

04:53:51.947 --> 04:53:53.449
BUT IT NEVER RELEASED WHAT THEY

04:53:53.515 --> 04:53:55.317
MEAN BY OPEN MINDED OBVIOUSLY

04:53:55.384 --> 04:53:57.586
IS VERY CLOSE MINDED IN TERMS

04:53:57.653 --> 04:53:59.788
OF THEIR PERCEPTION LAW. AND

04:53:59.855 --> 04:54:00.589
THE KIND THINGS THAT THAT THE-

04:54:00.656 --> 04:54:02.291
WHERE. A QUESTION OF OTHER

04:54:02.358 --> 04:54:03.926
BARBIES CHALLENGES BASICALLY

04:54:03.993 --> 04:54:06.362
BASED ON A PERSON'S RACE THEIR

04:54:06.428 --> 04:54:08.464
ETHNICITY THEIR GENDER ALL

04:54:08.530 --> 04:54:10.566
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

04:54:10.632 --> 04:54:11.500
WOULD THEN PRECLUDE YEAH. NEVER

04:54:11.567 --> 04:54:15.270
MIND BE ON THE JURY IT'S- AND-

04:54:15.337 --> 04:54:16.772
ASKING A PERSON THAT QUESTION

04:54:16.839 --> 04:54:18.407
MAYBE FOR AS YOU SAY PROBABLY

04:54:18.474 --> 04:54:21.610
IS WHITE. IF THEY HAVE OF YOU

04:54:21.677 --> 04:54:23.979
KNOW THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS US

04:54:24.046 --> 04:54:25.981
THOSE PARTICULAR CASE BEEN

04:54:26.048 --> 04:54:29.885
JURIES WHAT I'VE ASKED

04:54:29.952 --> 04:54:31.553
EVERYBODY SAID BECAUSE IT IS ON.

04:54:31.620 --> 04:54:32.921
ONE KNOW WHO AT ANY ANY KIND AT

04:54:32.988 --> 04:54:34.823
ALL. AND THAT HAVE SOME

04:54:34.890 --> 04:54:35.824
RELEVANCE BECAUSE OF A CASE THE

04:54:35.891 --> 04:54:37.493
REALLY WELL ABOUT IN. IN AND

04:54:37.559 --> 04:54:39.595
THEY ASK EVERYONE NOT JUST

04:54:39.661 --> 04:54:43.298
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN-

04:54:43.365 --> 04:54:44.733
WHO WORK BASICALLY OF COLOR OR

04:54:44.800 --> 04:54:46.902
WOMEN WHO THEY THOUGHT MIGHT

04:54:46.969 --> 04:54:50.139
HAVE BENEFITTED OR NOT. SENATE

04:54:50.205 --> 04:54:51.340
FROM SOMEONE SHOULD. I THINK.

04:54:51.407 --> 04:54:52.274
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR **** THEM

04:54:52.341 --> 04:54:54.476
THAT WOULD BE TO IN THE COURSE.

04:54:54.543 --> 04:54:55.110
BUT WHAT WAS SIMPLY SO IS THAT

04:54:55.177 --> 04:54:57.479
IF YOU'RE ASKING CHALLENGED AND

04:54:57.546 --> 04:54:58.614
IF SOMEONE IS COUNTING BASED ON

04:54:58.680 --> 04:55:00.449
RACE GENDER OR CLASS THEN YOU

04:55:00.516 --> 04:55:01.717
HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU WHY

04:55:01.784 --> 04:55:03.285
YOU. WHY YOU COULD ASK THE

04:55:03.352 --> 04:55:04.720
QUESTION WHAT NOW YOU DON'T

04:55:04.787 --> 04:55:06.355
HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THE FACT

04:55:06.422 --> 04:55:07.356
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT HAS TO

04:55:07.423 --> 04:55:12.494
BE- INTENTIONAL VERSUS- UP. TO

04:55:12.561 --> 04:55:16.899
A BASICALLY THE BOX IS THE

04:55:16.965 --> 04:55:20.969
INTENDED BIAS. THAT'S. THE

04:55:21.036 --> 04:55:23.672
QUESTIONS THAT. YEAH AND IT WAS

04:55:23.739 --> 04:55:25.674
PERFORMED NUMBER BEEN THAT BASE

04:55:25.741 --> 04:55:26.341
PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM SERVING ON

04:55:26.408 --> 04:55:27.443
JURIES NOT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

04:55:27.509 --> 04:55:28.744
HAS ALREADY ADMITTED THAT HE

04:55:28.811 --> 04:55:30.245
BELIEVES THERE'S ON THAT THERE

04:55:30.312 --> 04:55:32.381
ARE THERE IS UNCONSCIOUS BODY

04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:34.516
AND WE'VE HAD THAT THAT WE'VE

04:55:34.583 --> 04:55:39.988
HAD THE DEBATE. FOR MANY. ABOUT

04:55:40.055 --> 04:55:42.024
ONE OF LOS AND LAW IS NOW SAYS

04:55:42.091 --> 04:55:44.293
IS WE HAVE ONE INTENT BIAS

04:55:44.359 --> 04:55:46.028
SIMPLY IT KNOWLEDGE IN YOU HAVE

04:55:46.095 --> 04:55:48.063
IT IS NOT SO. IN ITSELF BECAUSE

04:55:48.130 --> 04:55:49.331
THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK THE

04:55:49.398 --> 04:55:50.799
QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT

04:55:50.866 --> 04:55:54.036
IT BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF BUT

04:55:54.103 --> 04:55:56.538
IN. A LOT JUST AS- AT THE STATE

04:55:56.605 --> 04:55:58.474
AS HE AS AS INTO. BY IN TERMS

04:55:58.540 --> 04:55:59.842
OF A PERSON LIFE. AND WOULD BE

04:55:59.908 --> 04:56:05.814
HAPPY IN THE- THAT WE MAKE.

04:56:05.881 --> 04:56:08.817
RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE. BUT

04:56:08.884 --> 04:56:11.587
AGAIN I THINK WE'RE- WE ARE

04:56:11.653 --> 04:56:13.222
MIXING THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT

04:56:13.288 --> 04:56:14.723
AND THEN I MEAN IF IT WAS

04:56:14.790 --> 04:56:15.924
INTENTIONAL AND SOMEONE WAS

04:56:15.991 --> 04:56:17.359
TRYING TO GET SOMEONE OFF THE

04:56:17.426 --> 04:56:19.428
JURY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE

04:56:19.495 --> 04:56:20.963
NATIONAL ORIGIN THAT SELF

04:56:21.029 --> 04:56:23.565
ALREADY CONSTITUTE. SO THAT I

04:56:23.632 --> 04:56:25.200
MEAN CURRENT LAW ALREADY DEALS

04:56:25.267 --> 04:56:27.302
WITH THAT SITUATION. BUT I

04:56:27.369 --> 04:56:28.470
THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT IS

04:56:28.537 --> 04:56:30.506
A IS THERE SOME SORT OF PRE TAX

04:56:30.572 --> 04:56:33.275
IS THERE SOME SORT OF THING IS

04:56:33.342 --> 04:56:37.446
BEING USED TO. COVER UP THAT.

04:56:37.513 --> 04:56:39.214
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL

04:56:39.281 --> 04:56:40.349
IS WERE SAYING HEY THESE

04:56:40.415 --> 04:56:42.084
QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED

04:56:42.151 --> 04:56:44.753
IN ONLY THESE QUESTIONS WILL

04:56:44.820 --> 04:56:46.788
ASSUME THAT THOSE ARE PRETEXT.

04:56:46.855 --> 04:56:47.990
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC

04:56:48.056 --> 04:56:49.958
BECAUSE WE'RE SAYING FOR YOU IF

04:56:50.025 --> 04:56:51.126
YOU HAD A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE

04:56:51.193 --> 04:56:52.928
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT

04:56:52.995 --> 04:56:56.899
THAT'S PRETEXT. FOR RACE. I

04:56:56.965 --> 04:56:58.767
DON'T KNOW THAT IT NECESSARILY

04:56:58.834 --> 04:57:01.770
IS YEAH- ASKING IF YOUR FAMILY

04:57:01.837 --> 04:57:04.606
MEMBER YOU KNOW WAS CONVICTED

04:57:04.673 --> 04:57:07.743
OF A CRIME. YOU'LL BE THE

04:57:07.809 --> 04:57:09.478
REVERSE IS TRUE THE DEFENSE IS

04:57:09.545 --> 04:57:10.646
GOING TO ASK DO YOU HAVE A

04:57:10.712 --> 04:57:13.148
FAMILY MEMBER LONG FORSMAN.

04:57:13.215 --> 04:57:13.882
YEAH TE DEFENSE IS GOING TO

04:57:13.949 --> 04:57:16.051
ASK YOU NO QUESTIONS ABOUT

04:57:16.118 --> 04:57:18.086
THEIR CONNECTIONS TO. LAW

04:57:18.153 --> 04:57:20.255
ENFORCEMENT AND THE LAWS WELL

04:57:20.322 --> 04:57:22.457
AND IF THEY FEEL LIKE THERE'S-

04:57:22.524 --> 04:57:23.225
SOMETHING THERE THEY'RE GOING

04:57:23.292 --> 04:57:24.826
TO EXECUTE A PEREMPTORY

04:57:24.893 --> 04:57:26.195
CHALLENGE IS THAT IS THAT

04:57:26.261 --> 04:57:27.996
QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BASED ON

04:57:28.063 --> 04:57:32.401
RACE GENDER. WELL I WOULD SAY

04:57:32.467 --> 04:57:34.002
THAT ALL THESE QUESTIONS ON THE

04:57:34.069 --> 04:57:35.804
OUTSIDE OR NOT BE YOU KNOW IN

04:57:35.871 --> 04:57:38.340
THAT WAY OKAY RIGHT- BUT WE'RE

04:57:38.407 --> 04:57:39.841
ONLY WITH YOUR LEGISLATION

04:57:39.908 --> 04:57:41.476
WE'RE ONLY SAYING SOME OF THESE

04:57:41.543 --> 04:57:42.911
QUESTIONS THE ONES THAT ARE

04:57:42.978 --> 04:57:44.446
OUTLINED IN YOUR BILL

04:57:44.513 --> 04:57:46.615
AUTOMATICALLY SUSPECT DID NOT

04:57:46.682 --> 04:57:48.717
AUTOMATICALLY SUSPECT ONLY IF

04:57:48.784 --> 04:57:50.052
SOMEONE OBJECTS. TO THE

04:57:50.118 --> 04:57:51.720
QUESTION THEN IT'S BECOME THEN

04:57:51.787 --> 04:57:53.021
YOU HAVE TO JUSTIFY WHY YOU

04:57:53.088 --> 04:57:54.423
HAVE Y. U. S. THAT QUESTION

04:57:54.489 --> 04:57:56.024
RIGHT BUT YOU CAN ONLY OBJECT

04:57:56.091 --> 04:57:57.526
ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T

04:57:57.593 --> 04:57:58.994
ALLOW THAT FOR OTHER OTHERS AS

04:57:59.061 --> 04:58:00.963
WELL I MEAN I THINK OF PERSON

04:58:01.029 --> 04:58:02.531
MAKES AN OBJECTION BASED ON.

04:58:02.598 --> 04:58:04.299
THE IT DISCRIMINATION ON THESE

04:58:04.366 --> 04:58:05.901
PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS THEN

04:58:05.968 --> 04:58:07.903
IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE PERSON

04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:10.172
MAY BE WHO. WHO'S BASICALLY

04:58:10.239 --> 04:58:12.074
MAKING THE CHALLENGE TO JUSTIFY

04:58:12.140 --> 04:58:13.976
WHY IT IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY

04:58:14.042 --> 04:58:15.944
BASED ON THOSE OF RACE GENDER

04:58:16.011 --> 04:58:19.881
OR OUR- OUR SEX. WHAT IS SAYING

04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:23.185
THAT THEY HAVE TO BASED ON THAT

04:58:23.252 --> 04:58:24.353
IT. THEY DON'T RATE ISSUE THAT

04:58:24.419 --> 04:58:26.622
IS THAT IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATE

04:58:26.688 --> 04:58:28.423
THEN WOULD NOT HAVE TO IT. NOW

04:58:28.490 --> 04:58:29.424
WORK THAT'S BEEN IN WASHINGTON

04:58:29.491 --> 04:58:31.126
SHOWS AS SOME WOULD SAY WITH

04:58:31.193 --> 04:58:33.962
THIS TIME REPORTS FOR EVER- THE

04:58:34.029 --> 04:58:35.063
WORK DONE IN WASHINGTON SHOWS

04:58:35.130 --> 04:58:36.698
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER.

04:58:36.765 --> 04:58:38.133
CAKE IS BASICALLY BEING

04:58:38.200 --> 04:58:39.401
CHALLENGED BECAUSE PEOPLE

04:58:39.468 --> 04:58:40.869
BECAME CONSCIOUS. OF THE

04:58:40.936 --> 04:58:42.337
QUESTION THEY WERE GOING TO ASK

04:58:42.404 --> 04:58:44.606
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT DID NOT

04:58:44.673 --> 04:58:46.408
REALIZE THAT THEY NEEDED TO

04:58:46.475 --> 04:58:46.975
FILL TO THEMSELVES AND- TO

04:58:47.042 --> 04:58:48.710
THEIR OWN BIASED. TO MAKE SURE

04:58:48.777 --> 04:58:50.145
THEY WEREN'T ASK THESE KINDS OF

04:58:50.212 --> 04:58:51.713
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NO

04:58:51.780 --> 04:58:53.682
RELEVANCE. TO THE CASE. OF SO

04:58:53.749 --> 04:58:55.817
AS A RESULT OF IT ACTUALLY DID

04:58:55.884 --> 04:58:57.819
NOT EXTEND TO BE ON THE BUT IT

04:58:57.886 --> 04:58:59.588
PUTS CISCO A- MINDSET THAT'S

04:58:59.655 --> 04:59:03.592
TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THAN SAY YOU

04:59:03.659 --> 04:59:04.426
HAVE TO HAVE AN- BECAUSE- YOU

04:59:04.493 --> 04:59:05.661
KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE

04:59:05.727 --> 04:59:07.329
INTENT. OFF TIMES IT HAS SUCH A

04:59:07.396 --> 04:59:08.930
BIG READ SAYING THAT YOU SEE.

04:59:08.997 --> 04:59:10.666
OFTENTIMES WE O THINGS WITHOUT

04:59:10.732 --> 04:59:12.534
NECESSARILY WITH WITHOUT

04:59:12.601 --> 04:59:13.635
THINKING ABOUT DOING IT BECAUSE

04:59:13.702 --> 04:59:15.037
OF THE- BIAS THAT THAT ONE

04:59:15.103 --> 04:59:16.672
ALREADY. TOO AND THE SYSTEM IN

04:59:16.738 --> 04:59:18.340
WHICH WE EXIST CAUSES US TO DO

04:59:18.407 --> 04:59:19.941
THESE THINGS. WITHOUT ACTUALLY

04:59:20.008 --> 04:59:21.343
THINKING ABOUT THE STUFF THAT

04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:23.779
WE DO. IN THE END THE IMPACT IS

04:59:23.845 --> 04:59:25.781
THE SAME. IT'S ALMOST LIKE

04:59:25.847 --> 04:59:26.948
BEING IN A CLASSROOM WHERE

04:59:27.015 --> 04:59:28.884
TEACHER TARGET CERTAIN KIDS WHO

04:59:28.950 --> 04:59:30.452
SHE BELIEVES IS GOING TO BE OUT

04:59:30.519 --> 04:59:32.854
OF CONTROL. YOU HAVE CERTAIN

04:59:32.921 --> 04:59:38.293
THINGS AS A RESULT. PART OF. I

04:59:38.360 --> 04:59:40.429
ASKED THE DOT TO THE- NET YOU

04:59:40.495 --> 04:59:43.131
MAY NOT. BUT SHE HAS A BIAS IN

04:59:43.198 --> 04:59:44.933
THESE YEAH MEN HER CLASS BUT

04:59:45.000 --> 04:59:46.401
THE IMPACT IS THE BECAUSE

04:59:46.468 --> 04:59:48.270
MISSING AND I DIDN'T BENEFIT IN

04:59:48.337 --> 04:59:49.871
STOCK AND THEY'RE BEING OVERLY

04:59:49.938 --> 04:59:50.972
OF CHRIS. COMPARE TO THEIR

04:59:51.039 --> 04:59:52.841
PEERS WE SEEN THAT TIME AND

04:59:52.908 --> 04:59:54.142
TIME IN SCHOOL IN CLASS SO THE

04:59:54.209 --> 04:59:56.578
BUYER ISSUE THE UNINTENDED. IS

04:59:56.645 --> 04:59:59.081
JUST AS DON'T AS INTENDED BY

04:59:59.147 --> 05:00:01.583
AND THIS IN THIS BASICALLY

05:00:01.650 --> 05:00:02.384
DEALS WITH WITH THAT PARTICULAR

05:00:02.451 --> 05:00:08.924
ISSUE. RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE

05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:10.759
THAT I GUESS THE PROBLEM WITH.

05:00:10.826 --> 05:00:12.260
WITH THE CURRENT BILL AS

05:00:12.327 --> 05:00:15.630
WRITTEN IS. IT'S SORT OF

05:00:15.697 --> 05:00:17.099
CALLING OUT ONLY CERTAIN

05:00:17.165 --> 05:00:19.234
QUESTIONS AS BEING POTENTIALLY

05:00:19.301 --> 05:00:21.870
SUBJECT TO OBJECTION. THERE ARE

05:00:21.937 --> 05:00:22.604
OTHER QUESTIONS THAT CAN WE

05:00:22.671 --> 05:00:26.141
GET. IN AND LOOK AT TENNIS HARD

05:00:26.208 --> 05:00:27.943
TO PROVE I MEAN IT AND MANY.

05:00:28.009 --> 05:00:29.344
YES EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS

05:00:29.411 --> 05:00:31.046
BECAUSE INTENT IS HARD TO DO IN

05:00:31.113 --> 05:00:33.248
MANY CASES YOU KNOW AND ARE IN

05:00:33.315 --> 05:00:34.616
GOING THROUGHOUT OUR CRIMINAL

05:00:34.683 --> 05:00:36.818
JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU EVEN TRYING

05:00:36.885 --> 05:00:40.322
TO PROVE- YOU KNOW. CERTAIN

05:00:40.389 --> 05:00:42.391
CRIMES YOU HAVE TO PROVE

05:00:42.457 --> 05:00:45.160
INTENT. AND CERTAINLY THAT IS

05:00:45.227 --> 05:00:48.163
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT

05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:50.132
RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT GOES

05:00:50.198 --> 05:00:52.567
IN AND BUT AS WE'RE GOING INTO

05:00:52.634 --> 05:00:54.936
THIS DISCUSSION WITHOUT HAVING

05:00:55.003 --> 05:00:57.973
THIS- STUDY EVEN COME BACK YET

05:00:58.039 --> 05:00:59.241
FOR INSTANCE FROM THE

05:00:59.307 --> 05:01:01.143
CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT

05:01:01.209 --> 05:01:02.677
AND JUST SORT OF ARBITRARILY

05:01:02.744 --> 05:01:03.912
DETERMINE DETERMINING THESE ARE

05:01:03.979 --> 05:01:06.415
THE QUESTIONS OF THE STAIRS

05:01:06.481 --> 05:01:10.519
BACKED. I DON'T THERE'S A LOT

05:01:10.585 --> 05:01:12.621
OF SUPPORT FOR THAT. THAT'S WHY

05:01:12.687 --> 05:01:15.123
I CAN'T I CAN'T SUPPORT YOU

05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.590
KNOW THE BILL AS IT'S

05:01:15.657 --> 05:01:17.426
PRESENTED. TIME IS CERTAINLY

05:01:17.492 --> 05:01:18.827
WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR JURIES

05:01:18.894 --> 05:01:22.030
ARE UNBIASED BUT I UP BUT AGAIN

05:01:22.097 --> 05:01:23.265
ARGUE THAT'S PART OF WHY WE

05:01:23.331 --> 05:01:26.368
HAVE PRINT THREE CHALLENGES. IS

05:01:26.435 --> 05:01:30.405
SO THAT. IN BOTH SIDES ASKING

05:01:30.472 --> 05:01:31.640
NO NOT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN ASKED

05:01:31.706 --> 05:01:33.575
A SPECIFIC QUESTION IN BOTH

05:01:33.642 --> 05:01:34.709
SIDES ASKING QUESTIONS OF

05:01:34.776 --> 05:01:37.279
JURORS. THEN THEY CAN MAKE A

05:01:37.345 --> 05:01:38.647
CHALLENGE THAT JUROR IS SAYING

05:01:38.713 --> 05:01:40.849
HEY I THINK THIS PERSON ISN'T

05:01:40.916 --> 05:01:43.018
GOING TO BE- FAIR THAT THEY ARE

05:01:43.084 --> 05:01:46.154
GOING TO BE UNBIASED IN MAKING

05:01:46.221 --> 05:01:47.789
A DECISION AND THE JURY AND I.

05:01:47.856 --> 05:01:51.560

05:01:51.626 --> 05:01:54.930
WAY OF DETERMINED THAT- SO. I'M

05:01:54.996 --> 05:01:56.698
HESITANT TO MOVE FOR WITH THIS.

05:01:56.765 --> 05:01:58.733

HAVE A STUDY COMING BACK TO

05:02:02.504 --> 05:02:05.273
STUDY IN THIS VERY ISSUE- AND

05:02:05.340 --> 05:02:07.075
ONE THING SIR WE DON'T HAVE AS-

05:02:07.142 --> 05:02:08.243

TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE AS

05:02:09.845 --> 05:02:11.079
MUCH TIME TO THAT AND GO

05:02:11.146 --> 05:02:13.582

LEADING FROM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

ON SEE WE'RE HERE REVISITING

05:04:34.656 --> 05:04:36.591

MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE

05:04:45.734 --> 05:04:46.835
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON

THIS POTENTIALLY FROM THE STATE

05:04:48.937 --> 05:04:50.105

WOULD ALSO LOVE. SEE A LOT OF

05:04:51.573 --> 05:04:52.207
INFORMATION AND DATA AROUND

CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU HAVE

05:04:54.342 --> 05:04:57.379
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO LIST TO

05:04:57.445 --> 05:05:00.815
SEE THAT- AS A FORMER FROM. A

05:05:00.882 --> 05:05:03.118
COUPLE THINGS I WILL SAY. ONE I

05:05:03.184 --> 05:05:04.219
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA

05:05:04.285 --> 05:05:07.756
THAT BOTH SIDES WOULD- COULD

05:05:07.822 --> 05:05:10.525
USE A COULD CHRISTMAS JEFF OUT

05:05:10.592 --> 05:05:12.160
OF THE CAR STE- PROSECUTORS

05:05:12.227 --> 05:05:14.763
COULD. ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M

05:05:14.829 --> 05:05:16.831
CERTAINLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

05:05:16.898 --> 05:05:17.365
TO MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO ARE

05:05:17.432 --> 05:05:17.932
CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.

05:05:17.999 --> 05:05:20.368
SCENE PRINTER YOU JUST USED IN

05:05:20.435 --> 05:05:21.903
EXACTLY THE WAY THAT WE WANT

05:05:21.970 --> 05:05:23.038
BUT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND I

05:05:23.104 --> 05:05:25.940
THINK. THAT HAS AN IMPACT. THE

05:05:26.007 --> 05:05:28.543
THING I WILL SAY THOUGH IS. IT

05:05:28.610 --> 05:05:30.178
IS ALL ABOUT INTENT AND AS

05:05:30.245 --> 05:05:31.413
SOMEONE WHO WAS ASKED THE

05:05:31.479 --> 05:05:33.515
QUESTION OF JURY POOLS. HAS

05:05:33.581 --> 05:05:35.550
ANYONE IN THIS ROOM HAD. OF

05:05:35.617 --> 05:05:37.018
EXPERTISE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:05:37.085 --> 05:05:38.186
WHEN IT COMES TO A PARTICULAR

05:05:38.253 --> 05:05:40.388
SITUATION. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT

05:05:40.455 --> 05:05:41.890
I DIDN'T HAVE A DISCO TEN IN

05:05:41.956 --> 05:05:43.058
ASKING THE QUESTION. THE REASON

05:05:43.124 --> 05:05:45.160
I WOULD ASK A QUESTION WOULD BE

05:05:45.226 --> 05:05:47.295
TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. JURORS

05:05:47.362 --> 05:05:49.698
WOULD BE ABLE TO BE FAIR AND

05:05:49.764 --> 05:05:52.133
IMPARTIAL. CONSIDERABLE ALL OF

05:05:52.200 --> 05:05:55.103
THE FACTS IN MAKING DECISION

05:05:55.170 --> 05:05:56.071
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.AND

05:05:56.137 --> 05:05:58.640
I I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

05:05:58.707 --> 05:06:01.676
HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASK

05:06:01.743 --> 05:06:04.446
THAT QUESTION IN A WAY. BECAUSE

05:06:04.512 --> 05:06:07.115
OFTENTIMES INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY

05:06:07.182 --> 05:06:09.184
HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES

05:06:09.250 --> 05:06:10.919
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TEND TO BE

05:06:10.985 --> 05:06:12.954
OF CERTAIN RACIAL OR ETHNIC

05:06:13.021 --> 05:06:14.789
BACKGROUNDS AND THERE IS AN

05:06:14.856 --> 05:06:15.924
ASSOCIATION BUT THAT IS NOT

05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:17.559
ALWAYS THERE'S NOT A DIRECT

05:06:17.625 --> 05:06:21.062
RELATIONSHIP HOW DO YOU TEACH

05:06:21.129 --> 05:06:23.298
THOSE ISSUES MEANT THAT YOU CAN

05:06:23.364 --> 05:06:27.135
STOP ESOS QUESTIONS BUT- UNDER.

05:06:27.202 --> 05:06:27.769
PART OF WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO

05:06:27.836 --> 05:06:29.504
ACHIEVE HERE SO THIS IS REALLY

05:06:29.571 --> 05:06:32.307
MORE COMMENTS- AS OPPOSED TO

05:06:32.373 --> 05:06:34.676
ASK YOU A QUESTION BUT- BUT YOU

05:06:34.743 --> 05:06:35.710
KNOW LOVE TO BE ABLE TO

05:06:35.777 --> 05:06:37.545
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I'M

05:06:37.612 --> 05:06:38.146
CERTAINLY GOING TO WILL. BE

05:06:38.213 --> 05:06:39.614
THINKING ABOUT THIS WITH BOTH

05:06:39.681 --> 05:06:41.549
THE WE HAVE TURNED. I DO THINK

05:06:41.616 --> 05:06:42.884
IT'S A DECISION THAT SHE

05:06:42.951 --> 05:06:44.652
CONTINUED ON LOAN SUPPORT TODAY

05:06:44.719 --> 05:06:46.254
BUT- HOPEFULLY WE HAVE NOT HAD

05:06:46.321 --> 05:06:47.689
A CHANCE TO TALK MORE ABOUT

05:06:47.756 --> 05:06:48.256
NEGLECT. WELL I THINK IT'S A

05:06:48.323 --> 05:06:50.425
GOOD THING IS THAT YOU ASKED

05:06:50.492 --> 05:06:53.928
EVERYONE THE SAME QUESTION. THE

05:06:53.995 --> 05:06:55.530
FACT OF THE MATTER IS I WOULD

05:06:55.597 --> 05:06:56.097
ASK THAT QUESTION TO EVERY

05:06:56.164 --> 05:06:58.099
TEACHER. DOESN'T SAY YES AND

05:06:58.166 --> 05:06:59.434
I'VE BEEN. I'VE BEEN THE ONLY

05:06:59.501 --> 05:07:00.468
ONE ASKED THAT QUESTION.

05:07:00.535 --> 05:07:02.871
MISSION AND MAYBE THAT WAS THE

05:07:02.937 --> 05:07:04.405
CASE. IN YOUR COURTROOM BUT

05:07:04.472 --> 05:07:06.808
THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT. I'M NOT

05:07:06.875 --> 05:07:07.408
I DON'T THINK EVERY COURTROOMS

05:07:07.475 --> 05:07:09.844
THE SAME. TO YOU. RECORD HAVING

05:07:09.911 --> 05:07:12.280
A BIT. OF A INVOLVED IN THAT

05:07:12.347 --> 05:07:14.883
BUT- BUT THERE ARE. THERE ARE

05:07:14.949 --> 05:07:16.050
CASES. YOU DON'T. ASK QUESTIONS.

05:07:16.117 --> 05:07:18.453
NOT YES I WOULD. JUST I WOULD.

05:07:18.520 --> 05:07:19.687
PAY AND THE AND THE PROBLEM WE

05:07:19.754 --> 05:07:21.222
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

05:07:21.289 --> 05:07:22.657
WITH. WITH THE- KINDS OF.

05:07:22.724 --> 05:07:24.292
THINGS THAT. THEY HAVE IN TERMS

05:07:24.359 --> 05:07:28.997
OF THE- INTERACTION. JURIES

05:07:29.063 --> 05:07:29.631
WERE THEY WERE DEALING BUSINESS

05:07:29.697 --> 05:07:34.335
THINGS PEOPLE. JUMPING OFF THE

05:07:34.402 --> 05:07:35.270
CLIFF WHATEVER THOSE THINGS

05:07:35.336 --> 05:07:36.905
CALLED AND ASKED THAT QUESTION

05:07:36.971 --> 05:07:39.874
YEAH. SO I THINK YOU KNOW I

05:07:39.941 --> 05:07:42.811
THINK THE IDEA OF PUSHING

05:07:42.877 --> 05:07:44.746
EVERYONE TO BE CONSISTENT IN

05:07:44.813 --> 05:07:45.847
THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THEIR

05:07:45.914 --> 05:07:46.648
HOUSE AND NO ONE'S GETTING

05:07:46.714 --> 05:07:47.882
SINGLED OUT I THINK THAT'S
