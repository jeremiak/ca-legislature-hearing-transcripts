MY DAD IS HERE. I DROVE UP THIS MORNING HE DIED. I GOT GOOD MARKS FOR MAKING IT UP HERE QUICKLY THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO CONSTRUCTION BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SACRAMENTO HE SAID NO THIS DAY IN HISTORY BUY A LOTTERY TICKET WE GOT UP HERE IN NOTHING FLAT. CELL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE. WERE FIX. BEFORE YOU ADD THIS AFTERNOON AS THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE TO THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY CREATED. FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE STATE'S CIVIL SERVICE AMERICA. SYSTEM. I WAS INITIALLY APPOINTED BY FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN SEVEN YEARS AGO AND DURING MY TENURE ON THE BOARD OUR PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN A CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CALLIE CHAR AND GOV OPS THE BOARD IS MADE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM WE'VE ABOLISHED OVER THOUSAND OUTDATED CLASSIFICATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY CLASSIFICATIONS IN FIELDS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND SKILLED TRADES WE'VE ALSO MADE IMPROVEMENT DEFLECTIONS PROCESS THROUGH A NUMBER OF REGULATORY AND POLICY CHANGES INCLUDING REQUIRING BROUGHT INCLUDES RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES AND MULTIPLE MULTIPLE APPLICATION METHODS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CANDIDATES TO APPLY FOR STATE SERVICE AND ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS. IN ADDITION OUR COMPLIANCE REVIEW DIVISION HAS CONDUCTED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY COMPLIANCE REVIEWS OF DIFFERENT HR DEPARTMENTS PRACTICES AND SEVEN SPECIAL INTO. INVESTIGATIONS I CAN READ INSTALLATION PROPRIETY SUCH AS PRESELECTION EXAM. EXAM CHEATING AND OPPORTUNISM WITH RESPECT TO APPEALS THE BOARD HAS DECIDED OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED APPEALS FROM DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MERIT APPEALS DURING MY TENURE AND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED LITTLE TO NO BACKLOG AND APPROXIMATELY THE BOARD HAVING BEEN REVERSED BY THE COURTS APPROXIMATELY 10% ARE TAKEN UP ON APPEAL AND LESS THAN 10% OF THOSE SO ABOUT 1% OVERALL ARE OVERTURNED SO ARE. AFFIRMATION RATE IS PRETTY GOOD THE GREAT BATTING AVERAGE. AS YOU MAY KNOW I SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER AS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE I STARTED FRESH OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I WORK FOR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FOR THE MAYOR'S OFFICE. FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR SIXTEEN YEARS MANAGING THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM AND SO I THINK MY PERSPECTIVE AS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE AND AS A MANAGER. GIVES ME THE BALANCE IN THE PERSPECTIVE NECESSARY. TO BE AN EFFECTIVE BOARD MEMBER AND TO RECOGNIZE. THE CASES THEY ARE PRESENTED AS THEY ARE PRESENTED AND RECOGNIZE IF THERE ARE ANY. CHALLENGES TO THOSE CASES AND KNOWING WHAT WOULD OR WOULD NOT BE UP HELD BY PORTION SOMEBODY TAKE ONE OF OUR DECISIONS ON. IT ALLOWS ME TO EFFECTIVELY WAY TO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEE IN QUESTION AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF HAVING THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST STATE EMPLOYEES. I WISH TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR REAL POINTING ME TO THE BEST TO THIS POSITION AND I AM HAPPY TO BE BEFORE YOU AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATE ROTH LET'S START WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM RESOLUTIONS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR YOUR CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO. THE CONTINUE SERVING OUR GREAT STATE. JUST ONE QUESTION OF IN MY TENURE HERE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO THE CHAIR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAD OVERSIGHT OVER OUR STATES IT PROJECTS AND EARLY IN MY TENURE I REMEMBER DEALING WITH THE STATE'S OF PAYROLL OF. IT PROJECT THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE I'M SURE WE'LL REVISIT THAT BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I REMEMBER BEING. IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION DURING THAT OVERSIGHT PROCESS WAS THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR- PAYROLL SYSTEM CLASSIFICATIONS SIMO USE AND THE LIKE. I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'VE INDICATED AND YOU HAVE MADE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT IN ATTEMPTING YOU IN THE BOARD IN ATTEMPTING TO SIMPLIFY THAT. OUR SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE ANY POJECTED. COMPLETION DATE WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT THE CHALLENGE I WAS MEETING WITH SENATOR MINING AND HIS STAFF EARLIER PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EVERYBODY AS WE SIT HERE TODAY BELIEVES IN CLASS CONSOLIDATION. EXCEPT WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE CLASSES AND THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND THEN A SORT OF LIKE WHEN YOU WALKING CONSOLIDATE BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO KEEP MY HOME AND SO WITH. IT BECOMES REALLY AS- A LEADERSHIP QUESTION AT HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAVE TO GET ON BOARD AND EVERYBODY HAS TO BE ON BOARD WITH IT IF. THERE ARE CONSOLIDATIONS THE UNIONS GET AWAY AND EVERYBODY GETS TO WIN AND SO IF THE IF THE MESSAGE FROM ON HIGH IS THAT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. THERE'S HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH MORE. I CAN'T GIVE YOU A DATE. IS THAT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU WERE CONSISTENTLY HEARING FROM ON HIGH THAT IN FACT WE NEED TO DO THIS. YES NO I MEAN I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT AND I THINK THAT IF WE ASK MOST DEPARTMENT HAS THEY WOULD ALSO AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CLASS CONSOLIDATION BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN PRACTICE. IS THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE A LITTLE MORE RELUCTANT TO. TO GIVE UP THEIR OWN CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE EXAMPLE I USED EARLIER TODAY WAS THAT OF A TURNS THEIR ATTORNEYS AND MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. AND SO IF YOU HAVE ONE ATTORNEY CLASSIFICATION YOU COULD APPLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT DEPARTMENT SAY WHAT I ACTUALLY NEED MY OWN ATTORNEY CLASSIFICATION YOU WALK AND HAVE ONE FOR YOU BUT I REALLY A SPECIAL ONE FOR ME BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP EMPLOYEES. NO WHICH DEPARTMENT THEY WERE APPLY FOR IN THAT THE COUNTER ARGUMENT IS THEN YOU APPLY TO THAT DEPARTMENT YOU. PASS THE TEST AND IF YOU WANT TO BE IN ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU APPLY FOR THAT DEPARTMENT IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR YOU DO THAT BUT THERE IS. THERE DEFINITELY ARE CHALLENGES WHERE DEPARTMENTS FEEL LITTLE PROTECTIVE OF THEIR OWN CLASSIFICATIONS EVEN THOUGH GLOBALLY THEY SUPPORT THE IDEA. SO IT IS IT'S A CHALLENGE AND I THINK IT COMES THE DECISIONS. THE IMPETUS IS GONNA HAVE TO COME FROM LEADERSHIP WE START MAKING THOSE. WELL I FOUND. I CERTAINLY AGREE AND IF IT IS TRUE THAT. THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PAYROLL SYSTEM AND CLASSIFICATIONS IN MO USE CLASSIFICATIONS OF SEVERAL A CONTRIBUTES TO SOME OF OUR DIFFICULTY IN FIELDING NEW IT SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY IN THE HR AND PAYROLL AREA WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT AND I COMMEND YOU. AND YOUR FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS FOR ATTEMPTING TO DO SO AND I CERTAINLY THE X. IT CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO AN EXPECTED ADMINISTRATION TO BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE AND- PROVIDE THAT SORT OF TOP DOWN GUIDANCE THAT YOU'VE BEEN REFERRING TO SO THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO. MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME VERY MUCH. MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU A MATTER PRO TEM ARE CONGRATULATIONS ON ON YOUR RE APPOINTMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT AND I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME EXCELLENT QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. OKAY GREAT LET ME ON MY CONGRATULATIONS AND LOOKING OUT TO THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE SERVED THIS BURDEN AT VERY SIGNIFICANT HERE THE INSTITUTIONAL SHINDO CERTAINLY THAT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON YOU KNOW IT'S NOT HOW WE USED TO DO IT IS HOW WE'VE IMPROVED FROM I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWELVE IS THAT CORRECT YES BACK FANTASTIC SO MY QUESTION WOULD PROBABLY BE JUST THAT PERSPECTIVE YOU CAME IN TWENTY TWELVE ALONG PRETTY YOUNG. WHILE YOU KNOW NOT TOO LONG. OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOU SEEN THOUGH YOU'RE VERY KIND. ONE WOMAN WE CARE ABOUT THOSE THINGS RIGHT AS LONG AS- BUTI THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO JUST GET A QUICK PERSPECTIVE ON THE AGENCY NOW OUT WITH A LOT OF THE NEW REGULATIONS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD FOR LABOR ALSO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALL OF THAT. HOW D YOU SEE ON YOUR THE AGENCY OR YOUR ASSIGNMENT TO KIND OF FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO THE PRESENT BEING BETTER IN TERMS REPRESENTING CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE. AND THE EMPLOYEES AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM. SO I'D ONE OF THE CHANGES IS WHEN I FIRST CAME IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE. THE REORGANIZATION THAT LET S. P. B. AND CAL H. ARE OFTEN TO TWO DIFFERENT APARTMENTS AND SO THAT YOU HAVE STARTED I THINK RIGHT BEFORE I CAME ON AND SO SORT OF SEEING HOW THOSE ENTITIES ARE BECOMING SEPARATE AND YET. REALLY QUITE INTERTWINED. SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ABOUT THE RULES NOW THAN THEY WERE BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF THAT. IT WAS THAT A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THERE WAS REALLY NO BLUEPRINT BECAUSE IT HADN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE WHAT WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE ABOUT INDEPENDENT BEST OCCASIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING INTO DEPARTMENTS EVERY THREE YEARS THAT'S NEW AND I THINK THAT THAT'S HELPFUL IT WILL HELP US IDENTIFY TRENDS. GOOD AND BAD HELP US IDENTIFY I'M FROM THE BEST PRACTICES IN DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO WITH ONGOING TRAININGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE LIKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS YOU MENTIONED. AND HELPING TO MAKE SURE I MEAN WHAT WE ARE IS THE ENTITY TO SORT OF SHINE A BRIGHT LIGHT WHEN SOMETHING GOES POORLY IT IS AS I WAS SAYING EARLY SORT OF UP TO THE LEADERSHIP TO SAY. YOU NEED TO DO THIS BUT AS HAS HAPPENED WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS SHOWN AND- SO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE WAY THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FRANKLY DOES BUSINESS NOW AND I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY WASN'T. EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE OF S. P. B. BUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT THE HARD WORKING. STAFF MEMBERS AT THAT AGENCY DID WAS WAS CERTAINLY A BIG PART OF THAT AND- WE WOULD HOPE WOULD GIVE OTHER AGENCIES ENGAGING IN. DUBIOUS PRACTICES A LITTLE BIT OF PAUSE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE SORT OF SEE THEIR NAMES IN THE HEADLINES ARE BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE SNOW INVITED TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES TO THE BOARD AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS IF SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKING OUT WELL FOR US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE OF FIVE CERTAINLY MERITORIOUS AND A LENGTHY AND WE APPRECIATE. THAT SO CONGRATULATIONS. MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR MINING THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND AGAIN APPRECIATED OUR CHANCE TO GET ACQUAINTED THIS AFTERNOON AND WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR REAPPOINTMENT THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP FOR ANOTHER ROUND. OF PUBLIC SERVICES TO APPRECIATED THEM AS WE DISCUSSED BRIEFLY AND I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO MEMBERS OF THE- OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. SOME BASED ON SURVEYS BY STATE PERSONNEL BOARD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NEARLY 60% OF AGENCIES DID NOT PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. IN THAT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED STATE GOVERNMENT SUPERVISORS DOZENS OF AGENCIES WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THE REQUIRED TRAINING. SO WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION BASED ON SURVEYS DONE BY SPT BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO MOVE THEM INTO ACTION IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS NOT A VERY ENCOURAGING. COMPLAINTS THE DATA OF DOING TRAINING THAT COULD BOTH PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM UNWANTED HARASSMENT LAWS TO PROTECT THE STATE FROM POTENTIAL LIABILITY. WE'RE SORT OF LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CHANNELS HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE SEVEN ON YOUR SIDE IT'S LIKE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AND THEY GO IN AND SO IF YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS FIFTY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THE TRAINING AND YOU KNOW THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH THE TRAINING. WE EXPOSE THAT WE BRING YOU AND IF IT IF IT WARRANTS THAT WE BRING YOU WENT BEFORE THE BOARD AND HAVE YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN'T FEEL WAS A PRIORITY FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES TO COMPLY WITH THE LINE WITH THOSE MANDATED TRAINING DIRECTIVES. AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT WERE. IF THE ISSUE WERE SUCH THAT THE GOVERNOR THOUGHT IT WARRANTED THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD REPLACE THE DEPARTMENT HEAD OR- MANAGERS COULD BE REPLACED BY THEIR DEPARTMENT. HANG ON WHAT THE ISSUE IS OUR JOB IS REALLY TO EXPOSE THAT AND TO. MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THERE ND THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT BUT TO EXPOSE ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK. IT IT LEAST PROVIDES A STARTING POINT THE- ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WHETHER THAT'S BY THE LEGISLATURE OR- OTHER STATE AGENCIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THIS JUST SEEMS UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR- CURRENT CLIMATE IN ITS IT'S A DISSERVICE TO EMPLOYEES IN A DISSERVICE TO TAXPAYERS AS WELL. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SHARE JUST MOVING FORWARD PRIORITIES CONCERNS. I THINK I ASKED YOU IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND HAD A MAGIC WAND IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND EVERYBODY WOULD. EVERYBODY WOULD LISTEN AND EVERYBODY WOULD DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO EVERYBODY WOULD DO THE TRAINING THE MANAGERS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES DID AT THE HIGHER LEVEL MANAGERS WOULD MAKE SURE THOSE MANAGERS DID IT ON THE DEPARTMENT HEADS WOULD MAKE SURE. AND ULTIMATELY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THOSE IN CHARGE ARE DOING BACK WHICH THEY CHARGE TO DO I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS A- A PUBLIC CHARGE THERE AND TRUSTED WE AS TAXPAYERS PAY THEIR SALARIES. AND I HAVE RULES THAT WORK AND THEY HAVE RULES AT WORK AND IF I DON'T. RULES AT WORK I DON'T GET TO HAVE MY JOB ANYMORE I'M IT WILL SO I ACTUALLY DON'T. DON'T HAVE THAT SAME PROCESS BUT YOU MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A- YOU DON'T GET YOUR PAYCHECK IF YOU HAVEN'T. THEN THE TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED AND IF I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT GOOD. YOU KNOW. MADAM CHAIR I DON'T HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THE NOMINATION TODAY THANK YOU.

J. TOPOL AND HER SISTER TAMMY. BEACH AND I AND TAMMY ALL MET WHEN WE WERE UNDERGRADUATES AT UCLA. LET ME SAY THE DISAPPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN BY FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN AND WHOLE HEARTEDLY ENDORSED BY GAVIN BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND TRULY MEANS THE WORLD TO ME I'VE HAD DEEP TIES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE MY DAYS THERE AND I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS GIVEN ME. I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE TODAY. WITHOUT THE WORLD CLASS EDUCATION THAT I RECEIVED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. VERY BRIEFLY DURING MY TENURE AS A REGION. I WOULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH A FEW GOALS NUMBER ONE. MAKE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS I BELIEVE THE QUALIFIED STUDENTS SHOULD GET THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT I GOT. NUMBER TWO I'D LIKE TO HELP ENHANCE AND EXPAND THE REACH OF YOU SEE HEALTH. THE SYSTEM THIS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON MY FAMILY. AND IN IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT QUALITY HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED THE EXPERTISE OF YOU CA YOU SEE HEALTH. CAN RECEIVE IT. AND LASTLY WITH THE PASSING OF FORMER REGENT TAUSCHER MY COLLEAGUES HAVE APOINTED ME AS THE NEW VICE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL LABORATORY COMMITTEE. AS RESULT I WANT TO MAINTAIN AND GROW UC'S OVERSIGHT OF THESE TRULY REMARKABLE. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY LABS AND PROVIDE THAT PROVIDE INNOVATION. AND NATIONAL SECURITY AND SAFETY. TO NOT JUST OUR FELLOW CITIZENS BUT TO THE WORLD AS A WHOLE. ALL OF THOSE GOALS ARE ATTAINABLE THEIR MEASURABLE. AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I INTENDTO BE INSISTENT CONSISTENT AND PERSISTENT IN MY PURSUIT TO EXECUTE THE DUTIES AS REGION IN THE MOST HONORABLE WAY I KNOW HOW. SO TO THAT AND LET ME ON THE END WHERE I BEGAN AND SAM HONOR TO BE HERE AND I'M OPEN TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME START THIS TIME WITH YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM IN THANK YOU MISTER SERVICE FIRST FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE SERVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN. IN THE CAPACITY THAT YOU JUST OUTLINED. WITH THE FURTHER ASSIGNMENT WITHIN THE BOARD OF REGENTS I ENJOYED OUR OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE NOTES AND ARE. RELATIVE TUITION FEES WE ONLY ATTENDED UC CAMPUSES DON'T TELL YOU WHAT WHAT I DIDN'T PAY WHEN I WAS THERE. BUT IT'S THE FINEST INSTITUTE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD ONE OF THINGS WE DID DISCUSS THAT I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO. FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. THE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING FIRST AMENDMENT FREE SPEECH RIGHTS ANA AND PROTECTING THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF HAD A WE- ENDEAVOR TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT BUT PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY THANK YOU CENTER AS WE SPOKE ABOUT I DID MEET WITH THE A DL ONE OF THE FIRST MEETINGS I TOOK AS A REGION WAS WITH THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. MY MOTHER WAS A EXPERIENCE EXTRAORDINARY ANTI SEMITISM IN HER YOUTH. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR ON ONE HAND WE HAVE HATE SPEECH AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE FREE SPEECH AND I THINK THE JOB OF REGION'S IS TO FIND THE MIDDLE LINE WHERE EVEN UNPOPULAR VOICES CAN BE HEARD AND ALLOWED TO SPEAK BUT TO THE POINT WHERE SOMEONE'S LIFE IS IN DANGER OR ITS INCITING VIOLENCE I'M JUST NEVER GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN UNDER MY WATCH I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT MIDDLE LINE IS DIFFICULT TO FIND. I DON'T THINK SO I THINK HATE SPEECH IS HATE SPEECH IT HAS. ZERO CLICKS. THERE'S NO PLACE ON THE CAMPUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND- ON THE OTHER HAND I DO WANNA AS UNPOPULAR AS IT IS TO HEAR SOME SPEAKERS AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE HAVE TO GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT'S THEIR RIGHT BUT THEY JUST CANNOT INCITE VIOLENCE AND THAT'S HOW I DRAW THE LINE. THANK YOU ANOTHER AREA THAT WE DID TOUCH ON TO IS. LOOKING AT. RELATIVE ENROLLMENT FIGURES TO VARIOUS. MINORITY POPULATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE RELATIVELY LOW ON ENROLLMENT RATES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS YOU SHARED SOME THOUGHT SON. HELLO HELLO WE CAN REMEDY NOT ONLY ACCESS BUT RETENTION. SOME OF THEM MAY BE INTERNAL REFORMS NECESSARY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S CONDUCIVE TO. REFLECTING THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YES AFRICAN AMERICAN. ENROLLMENT IS LOW I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING UP IT'S ONLY A FOUR FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT IT'S UP FROM SIX YEARS AGO BUT IT SHOULD BE UP HIGHER I THINK THERE'S MANY ISSUES AT PLAY HERE I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY DEVELOP SOME OF THE SUMMER PROGRAM SO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN COME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO GO TO COLLEGE SO IT'S NOT SUCH A SCARY THINGS THAT THEY FEEL SAFER THERE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE MENTORSHIP ON CAMPUS AND WHEN I MEAN MENTORSHIP NOT JUST STUDENT MENTORSHIP. WE HAVE TO GROW OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY AND STAFF SO THAT FACULTY AND STAFF CAN. MENTOR STUDENTS THAT'S HOW THEY FEEL SAFE IN AN UNFAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT. IT'S OBVIOUS FINANCIAL AID IS AN ISSUE WITH WE HAVE A TRUCK TREMENDOUS. COMPETITION ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND WAYS AROUND THAT THAT IT'S TRICKY. AND THE LAST THING IS YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS OUTRAGE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS. FOR COLLEGE PREP AND TO REALLY EDUCATE STUDENTS ON WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW PRODUCTIVE IT IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO LOOK INTO I MIGHT. COME BACK TO AND SAY. LET'S HAVE THREE HUNDRED SCHOOLS BUT LET'S DO IT WELL. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE DIGGING INTO AN WHICH IS THAT WAS SOMETHING WE SPOKE ABOUT IN OUR LAST MEETING. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO LEAVE IT ALL CONCLUDE BY. ALSO THINKING YOUR FAMILY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN. GIVING YOU THE SUPPORT TO FURTHER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO MUCH CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE FAMILY. THANK YOU SENATOR BAIT. THANK YOU AND DODD THANK YOU MISTER SIR IS FOR ACTUALLY STEPPING FORWARD INTO A VERY VERY CHALLENGING POSITION ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME AND I THINK IN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WE HAD A GREAT MEETING HE WAS ON THE HOT SEAT YOU GUYS BUT AFTER THE QUESTIONS I FELT LIKE I WAS SO WE HAD A REALLY GOOD EXCHANGE AND I THINK WE FOUND. THE WITH MOST MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS TO BE IN HERE AS YOU MAY ALL KNOW AND CERTAINLY WITH THE UC SYSTEM IS THE GROWTH OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE BUREAUCRACY I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IMPAIRS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VISION OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO SET THE RULES IN THE RANKS THAT MASS RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE WE COME HERE TO SERVE IN HERE AND YOU SEE ARE WE SEE A GROWTH OF ADMINISTRATION OVER. THE TEN YEAR JOB PROFESSORS AND WHAT I CONSIDER ACADEMIA THE STAFF AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND I DID MENTION I'D LIKE YOU TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WHAT THE REGION'S MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO BASICALLY KIND OF RAIN INDIANA AND BRING SOME BALANCE BACK YES THANK YOU CENTER. BATES THE BUREAUCRACY IS FRUSTRATING. YOU ALL ARE INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT ON A DAILY BASIS I'M IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT THE BUREAUCRACY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I WANT TO LOSE MY HAIR. AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I GIVE CREDIT SAID GAVIN TO GOVERNOR BROWN INTO. GOVERNOR NEWSOME YOU DO NEED SOME PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRIVATE PRACTICE ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS THAT CAN GIVE THAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. WHOEVER SAID THAT THIS WAS A RUBBER STAMP BOARD I DON'T MAYBE IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. IT'S NOT NOW AS I'VE TOLD A NUMBER OF YOU IN PRIVATE SESSION WE GO OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON THAT BOARD. BUREAUCRACY IS A BIG ISSUE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WHERE SOME OF THE BUREAUCRACY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WE ARE GOING LINE BY LINE ON THAT BUDGET AND SAYING IS THIS NECESSARY. DO WE NEED IT AND IS IT WORTH IT. AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT I THINK THAT. IT TAKES TIME AS A NEWLY APPOINTED REGION. IT TAKES TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE BUREAUCRACY IS AND WHAT'S WORKING WELL AND THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS LOOK AT YOU IN THE EYE AND SAY I'M GONNA DIG DEEP INTO THAT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE RUNNING THE MOST EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL AFTER OUR OUR I THINK FORTY FIVE MINUTE DISCUSSION WE HAVE FULL THANK YOU AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. BUT THEY CAME OUT APPROACH HIM FIRST OF ALL I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHAT SETS CALIFORNIA APART FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND I KNOW I TALK TO YOU ABOUT A CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF AEROSPACE SOME LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT FACTOR RATED UCLA AFTER OUR MEETING SO. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME BUT THAT NIGHT LET THEM KNOW THAT YOUR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW FROM THE CONSTITUTION THAT. YOU GUYS ARE IN TO GET OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY. ENGINE I'M IS GIVING YOU AN ANECDOTAL STORY AND I. HAVE NO DATA EVEN BACK IT UP BUT I. COUPLE YEARS AGO I RAN TAKEN STATION OF MINE IN THE ANNALS VALLEY. HAS A DAUGHTER EXCELLENT ACADEMICALLY FOUR POINT WHATEVER. A LIFELONG DREAM YET TO BERKELEY DID I GET INTO BERKELEY GOT INTO UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HER COUSIN WHO LIVES IN MICHIGAN. GUIDED TO BERKELEY AND. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO HAVE OUT OF STATE AND IN THEIR SAW A CULTURAL ENRICHMENT ASPECT AS WELL SO BUT WAS SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT YOUR VIEW IN TERMS OF PROPER PROPER MIX THERE WE HAVE A MIX RIGHT NOW IT'S A IT'S AT 18% I MEAN FOR CERTAIN SCHOOLS IT'S GONE UP. I THINK THERE IS AN ASPECT OF DIVERSITY FROM OUT OF STATE OUT OF COUNTRY I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE REFER TO ADD A STATE BUT I THINK IN THAT IN THAT CATEGORY OUT OF COUNTRIES A PORTION OF IT. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE THE DIVERSITY OF OUT OF STATE NOT A COUNTRY I ALSO. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SAY THAT OUT OF STATE STUDENTS TO HELP SUPPORT IN STATE STUDENTS THEIR TUITION DOES AND I THINK THAT'S VALUABLE BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO WALK THE FINE LINE. WE SOME OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR CAP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT HAPPENS. CURRENTLY IF THE US FAM. SCHOOL EXCEEDS THEIR CAP OF OUT OF STATE THE ACCESS FUNDS THE DIFFERENTIAL GOES BACK TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT THEN CAN BE USED FOR OTHER SCHOOLS I THINK THAT'S- REASONABLE. AND I THINK THAT WE JUST AS A BORDER GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER AS A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE BUDGETARY BASED AND I THINK AS ALL OF US ALL REGIONS HAVE THE OBLIGATION. I THINK WE SIT HERE BEFORE YOU AND SAY OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATES THE MOST NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS QUALIFY CALIFORNIANS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO DO. BREAK SO A SOFA SO OF A FOLLOW UP ON THAT SEE RECENTLY VOTED TO INCREASE TUITION ON OUT OF STATE OUT OF COUNTRY STUDENTS WHAT FACTORS WOULD YOU CONSIDER MAKING ASSESSMENT IF WE NEEDED TO RAISE TUITION FOR IN STATE STUDENTS. HI VOTED ON THAT MEASURE WAS A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT DOLLAR INCREASE FOR OUT OF STATE STUDENTS THAT HADN'T BEEN RAISED IN SOMETIME. AND WANT TO DO IT IT WOULD HAVE LED TO A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL AND NO ONE HAD A GOOD ANSWER OF HOW THAT WAS GONNA MAY BE MADE UP SO THAT'S WHY I VOTED FOR. UP IN STATE. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME IT'S THE MOST TALKED ABOUT QUESTIONS AND THE BOARD OF REGENTS IS ABOUT RAISING TUITION ON IN STATE IN. A STUDENTS. I THINK IT WILL BE THE LAST THING ANY OF US WILL WANT TO DO. I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE. CONTROLLING THERE WILL BE MOVING MONIES AROUND ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. INEVITABLY THOUGH IT WILL HAPPEN. AND I THINK IT'S JUST GONNA REQUIRE LEADERSHIP. I AM INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUE JOHN FOR AS HIS OUR NEW CHAIRMAN ON HIS GRASP OF THIS MATTER AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO THE LEADERSHIP OF A COUPLE OF REGION'S WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK HERE. ANNA TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DON'T DO THAT AND HOW WE CAN KEEP IT AFFORDABLE IT'S EXPENSIVE. BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD DEAL IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND CERTAINLY PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. BUT LET ME JUST SAY ONE LAST THING I DON'T WANT TO RAISE TUITION IS THE LAST THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO AND I'M COMMITTED TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN BEFORE THAT HAPPENS OKAY. HEY BY THE WAY I WANTED NICE TIE. BUT HE HE SAID TO ME THAT MY TIE LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE TUCKER CARLSON'S TÁI. WHICH WAS AS ABOUT AS OFFENSIVE AS YOU THINK YOU COULD SAY TO ME. SO WE WERE JUST SAID ALL ALL ALL DEAL WITH A LOT IT DOESN'T TRIGGER ANYBODY WERE GOOD YEAH. GOOD ANYWAY PREPARATION OUR TIME LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR- RECONFIRMATION TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER LOOK. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM A CONGRATULATIONS I ACTUALLY HAVE NO QUESTIONS I AM VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR. RESUME IF WE HAD MORE TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE THINGS DID A FASCINATION AND NOTHING ELSE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR NEW POSITION AND MEN APPROACHED HIM I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING THE CONFIRMATION AN- APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY I MAY BE FOLLOWING ALONG ON THE- THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE. BEEN IN RELATION TO THE BUREAUCRACY IN THE BOARD AND- YOU MADE A COMMENT IT'S NOT A RUBBER STAMP BOARD AND I'M PRETTY CLEAR I'VE SEEN THE APPOINTMENTS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN MADE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERE ON THE BOARD. I WANTED TO ASK FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE- I ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS WHEN I WAS SPEAKER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND I ALWAYS FELT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT VERY INVITING FOR PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SPEAK. NINE AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT DOES THATFEEL LIKE IS THAT ALSO CHANGING I WOULD REALLY HOPE BECAUSE- I REALLY THINK ARE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO COME TO SPEAK CALM FOR A REASON US YOU KNOW A IT BUT SOME REALLY IT'S THEIR OPPORTUNITY BUT HEARD AND I ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS A VERY. COLD PLACE IT IS SENATOR I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS VERY COLD PEOPLE GIVEN ONE MINUTE TO SPEAK. A BUZZER GOES OFF. IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS AT THAT MOMENT ALTHOUGH. OUR SECRETARY DOES TAKE NOTES WE GET A- A BRIEFING MATERIAL. PACKET AFTERWARDS WHERE WE CAN RESPOND TO THE INDIVIDUAL. CONSTITUENTS TO COME UP AND GET PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD SECURITY ISSUES THERE SO THERE'S- MANAGEMENT OF SECURITY ISSUES I GIVE IT TO CHAIR PEREZ WHO. I THOUGHT THERE WAS OVER SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THE NEW SHARE HAS REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY THERE I THINK.
