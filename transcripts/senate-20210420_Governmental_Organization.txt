GOOD MORNING CHAIR DIED IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB TWENTY EIGHT THE RURAL BROADBAND AND DIFFA REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO COMMITTEE STAFF IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH STATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SHOULD INVENTORY STATE PROBLEM PROPERTY FOR POSSIBLE USE FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE BASED ON CRITERIA FROM THE CPUC. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER AGENCIES THE ORDER FURTHER STATES THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WILL IDENTIFY AND FACILITATE NEW BROADBAND PROJECTS IN SUPPORT OF PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WITH CALLAWAY YES TO INVENTORY BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY TO ALL OF THE FAIRGROUNDS SB TWENTY EIGHT TAKES A SIMILAR APPROACH REQUIRING THE CPUC THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CALTRANS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES TO INVENTORY STATE RESOURCES. THAT CAN BE MADE ABOUT AVAILABLE FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AT MINIMUM SPEED OF A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWNLOAD SPEEDS SB TWENTY EIGHT TAKES A BROAD VIEW OF STATE RESOURCES TO INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY THAT COULD BE USED TO SITE BROADBAND EQUIPMENT RIGHT TO RAISE IT COULD BE USED FOR ROUTING FIBER AND EVEN WIRELESS SPECTRUM THAT COULD BE USED FOR BANDWIDTH CAPACITY. SB TWENTY EIGHT PRECLUDES THE USE OF STATE RESOURCES IF THE USE WOULD CREATE A RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY SUCH. AS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. SB TWENTY PASSED THE RESP AGE TO CREATE TEMPLATE LICENSING AGREEMENT SO THAT THE STATE CAN READILY CONTRIBUTE THESE RESOURCES TO BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. SB TWENTY EIGHT BILLS ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY TO CLOSE THE GAPS WITH STATE RESOURCES CONTRIBUTING TO DESPERATELY NEEDED BROADBAND DEPLOYMENTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE CITING OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A PROJECT'S TOTAL CAPITAL COSTS. ELEMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME A STATUTE CALLED THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX OR GIVE CAP. WHICH PROVIDES CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES WITH THE STATE WIDE TEN YEAR LONG FRANCHISE LICENSE TO DEPLOY DIGITAL VIDEO SERVICES. SINCE DAVID DIFFICULT PASSED THE DIGITAL VIDEO PAID BUSINESS ACCOMPLISHED COMPLETE MARKET SATURATION MEANING PAY TV SERVICES ARE AS UBIQUITOUS AS ENERGY AND WATER UTILITIES NEARLY A COMMODITY AND THEIR SCALE. WHAT IS NOT CHANGED IS THAT WHILE DIFFICULT WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING COMPETITION TO THE PAY TV MARKET MARKET IT DID NOT. JUST A HANDFUL OF THE TWENTY EIGHT DIFFICULT LICENSEES ALSO PROVIDE HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICES 296% OF THE STATE. COMMUNITIES WITHOUT REAL BROADBAND ARE BEING ABANDONED ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HAVE STRUGGLED TO ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR ESSENTIAL PURCHASES ONLINE WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING THIS COVERED VIRUS. WORK FROM HOME AS REQUIRED BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER ACCESS VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS LIKE ZOOM OR ATTEND SCHOOL THROUGH ONLINE EDUCATION PLATFORMS THE PICTURE OF THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS FROM MY DISTRICT USING THE INTERNET CONNECTION IN FRONT OF TALK ABOUT DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT'S A HAUNTING PICTURED THAT DR HOLE THAT DRIVES HOME THE UNEXPECTED SEPT DOUBLE STATE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN ALMOST ALL CASES TE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE WITHOUT HIGH SPEED INTERNET OR RURAL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ARE ULTIMATELY UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME. LOW POPULATION LOW POPULATION DENSITY OR BOTH. DIFFICULT FRANCHISEES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO LOW INCOME BILL THAT REQUIREMENTS CENTS TWENTY CENTS TWENTY OH FIVE. AND THE CPUC DOES NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT SELF REPORTED DATA FROM THE LICENSEES TO KNOW IF THOSE RESIDENTS ARE RESERVING ARE RECEIVING SERVICES. IN A NON DISCRIMINATORY MANNER SB TWENTY REFORM DIPPED REQUIRING GRAND DATA BE REPORTED IT TO THE C. P. U. C. SO THAT FINALLY THE STATE WILL HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF THE GAPS. GAINING THIS ACCURATE NETWORK MAP IT'S CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THIS DATA THE CPUC CANNOT READILY DETERMINE IF A LICENSE SHOULD BE RENEWED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF TEN YEARS. AND RENEWING A STATEWIDE LICENSE FOR THAT LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT THIS DATA IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. SB TWENTY EIGHT HAS A CLEAR INTENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. FROM THE CONSUMER BEING SHARED- AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MET COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CLARIFYING THAT NO PERSONAL INFORMATION- WILL BE SHARED THE BILL REQUIRES THE CPUC TO CONSULT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE FRANCHISEE'S. SERVICE TERRITORY REGARDING REMEDIES FOR THE SERVICE IMPACTS. AS PART OF ANY PROCEEDING TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE THE FRANCHISE AND IT IS THE STICK THAT MATTERS MORE MORE. MOST BECAUSE PRIOR TO DIFFICULT FRANCHISE HOLDERS HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GAIN SUBSCRIBER ACCESS MANY OF YOU WHO SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REMEMBER THOSE DAYS WHEN THEY THESE. FRANCHISEES HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED OF WHAT WAS IN THE BASIC PACKAGE AND HOW MUCH THEY'D BE CHARGING FOR THAT. DIFFICULT REMOVED LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM THE GO SHEETING TABLE AND SB TWENTY EIGHT RESTORES LOCAL EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY SHIFTING THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF NO NEGOTIATING THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. BACK TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PROVIDING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT TODAY IS JEFF MEAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR PROBABLY MORNING MISTER NAY. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- HE SACKETS SUPPORT OF SB TWO EIGHT BOTH THE THAT WOULD CREATE A STATE IN THE OF THE COULD BE HELPED IN TACKLING BROUGHT BY. WHICH IS ONE OF THE RECOMMEND. BROADBAND FOR ALL ACTION PLAN WHICH EXECUTIVE DOORS IN HOLD WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO A DOCTOR OF HAVE BEEN ALSO PART RELATING TO DISCUSS. AS KABIR MENTIONED BEFORE DIFFERENT UNIQUE COME HAD TO WITH COUNTY SAN CITY. WHEN THEY TO START SERVING THE THEY WANTED JUST A HIGH THE COMMUTER THE CASHIER'S- COULD WORK THEM TO SERVE THE LOW AREA THE COMMUNITY AS WELL BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE COMPANY'S PUSHED HARD FOR THE BEST A RANGE. THAT IS THAT IN MY BECAUSE WITH THE COUNTY AND CITIES THEY AND FOR US BRANCH I PHARMACY THAT NEW TO A BIT MODEL WOULD LEAD TO EVERY GETTING TO SERVER THE FIRST BETTER AND YOU. BOUTIQUES BORN OF FIFTEEN UNDER THE MODEL WE KNOW KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT TO DETER CLEANING FROM HAVE SLOT TO THE SERVICE AND HIGH PROFIT MARKETS BUT LOW PROFIT THERE IS. COMMUNITY IMPROVE. HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. BUT FOUGHT SO HARD TO HAVE BEEN FOUR MINUTES. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE PG&amp;E FOR EXAMPLE REFUSING TO TELL THE STATE WHICH HOMES AND BUSINESSES THEY SERVE. AS HARD TO IMAGINE A PRIVATE WATER COMPANY REFUSING TO SAY NOT ONLY WHICH RESIDENTS A SERVICE BUT ALSO WHETHER THE WATER MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION. FOR BROADBAND WHICH WE ALL KNOW AGREED AS A UTILITY. NECESSARY FOR MODERN LIFE. BUT HE'S OUR- THAT HELD THE STATE WHETHER THE RED. OF RURAL COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS AND WHETHER IT MEETS THE WEATHER THE SPEECH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. BUT THIS IS. HOW KIDS GO TO SCHOOL THE STATUS OF HOW PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR BANKS DIDN'T ACCESS MEDICAL CARE. TO THE SOLUTION SB TWENTY TO SIMPLE IT JUST SAYS THIS INITIALLY BUT THE CAN YOU SEE CAN DO ALL THE THINGS THAT COUNTIES AND CITIES USED TO BE ABLE TO DO. A WHEN WE HAD LOCAL FRANCHISES IN THE DIGITAL SERVICE PROVIDER ISN'T MEETING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. TO GO ALONG WITH THE BENEFITS IT GETS FROM DITKA. COUNTIES AND CITIES CAN RETURN TO THEIR SEAT AT THE TABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE. SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NOW LET'S BE WITH ANY OTHER WHICH- AND GALLERY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AT CAROLYN MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. RESHAPE THE OSCARS GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE BUT WE MATCH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB TWENTY EIGHT AND THEN UNLAWFUL EXPANSION OF THE STATE VIDEO FRANCHISING AUTHORITY THAT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND WOULD ACTUALLY DETER INVESTMENT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS A LIVE STATE FORTY TWO ISSUE CABLE AND VIDEO FRANCHISES IS DERIVED FROM FEDERAL LAW TITLE SIX IN THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT THIS LAW EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS FRANCHISING AUTHORITIES BLIGHTED SI PC FROM REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDED BY CABLE OPERATORS EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NOT INCLUDE. BROADBAND AVAILABILITY REQUIREMENTS LIKE THOSE. DISCUSSED IN SB TWENTY EIGHT. NOTHING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT GRANTS THE STATE AUTHORITY TO USE STATE FRANCHISING TO REGULATE BROADBAND SERVICE CLEARLY STATED THE STATE IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL DISRUPTION FOR EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS WHICH ULTIMATELY WOULD GET HER NOT ADVANCE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. BOARD SPECIFICALLY SB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE EACH DIFFERENT FRANCHISEE TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SERVICE AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN A SENSE OF SPOT. SENATORS BLOCKED ROADS CONFLICTS WITH HOW DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS ARE REPRESENTED TO THE CPC SHAPE FILES OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT DO NOT ALIGN. WITH DENTISTS BUT DOWN THREE. DO AND SEVENTY COMES THE TO HAVING MAY NOW PROVIDE IN A PART OF THE SENSE OF A LOT WITH THEIR GIVE COMPLAIN AREA. THERE ARE CASES WHERE DEPLOY AFTER. TWENTY FAIR. HAVE BEEN A HOLD FOR MONTHS OR YOU DID TODAY IN THAT PERMITS. IN EVERY CASE IS THE CELANESE MAKE PASS THROUGH A SENSE BLOCK IN ORDER TO RETAIN ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER IN ANOTHER AREA AND ARE NOT ENGINEERED TO PROVIDE READ RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. TWENTY EIGHT IS ALSO NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THERE ARE A VARIETY AND AB VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES AS WELL AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES THAT OPERATE WITHOUT A DIFFERENT FRANCHISE. SB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD IMPOSE NEW MANDATE ONLY ON DIFFERENT FRANCHISEE. ESTABLISHING DIFFERENTIAL REGULATORY TREATMENT AMONG COMPETING PROVIDERS BETTER THAN FAIR AND WOULD ACT AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO MARKET FORCES THAT HAVE GENERATED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BROADBAND. NETWORK INVESTMENT IN RECENT YEARS- I RECKON THAT THE SENATOR DID IN FACT AGREE TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS PRIVACY ISSUES THAT MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT PRICES PRIVACY. REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL CABLE ACT THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD ALSO BE VIOLATED BY THE SPELL FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AT THREE TWENTY EIGHT ADD ON LEVEL AND REQUEST THAT NO MATTER. THANK YOU. MODERATE COMING HERE NEXT. ADELINE. THIRTY SEVEN. MODERATE COULD YOU ASK AGAIN PLEASE. ONCE AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN. ZERO CAN ONE MOMENT. AND FROM NINE FORTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. IT WITH THE CHAIR- THIS IS A LAW THAT THAT INCIDENT WITH CAL COM- IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWENTY EIGHT- AND DELETE THE COMMENTS FROM- CAROLYN MCINTYRE WITH CABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO. SPEAKING OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN. ZERO AMAZON THANK YOU MODERATOR IN THANK YOU TO OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL HELP BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK THE MEMBERS DELIVER MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE AT CENTER HUESO LOSE THE BILL. CENTER CABALLERO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ATTENTION AS SOMEONE ALSO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS UP- EARLY IN IN THE HEARING- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE CPUC HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO TO LOOK AT AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR THE FRANCHISEES ARE- THE DIFFICULT FRANCHISEES ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY AGREED TO. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT THEY'RE NOT. WE HAVE A HUGE AREAS WHERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SERVICE OR THE SERVICE IS SO SLOW DIED ON OUR- STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET ON IS IN CLASS. AND AND IT MISSED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT- THIS IS A REASONABLE APPROACH IT GIVES THE CPUC YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY MY ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS TO BLOW UP THAT THE- STATEWIDE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TO GO BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- AND HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE- COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THAT DESPERATELY NEED ACCESS- BUT THIS THIS I WAS YOU KNOW- CONVINCED TO GET OFF OFF THE CLIFF AND TAKE A MUCH MORE REASONABLE APPROACH THIS GIVES THE CPUC THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHO IS GETTING THE SERVICE- BYE BYE AREA AND LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN USE THE ACCESS FUNDS THAT WE HAVE- THAT WE COLLECT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE. IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN A COORDINATED WAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR HUESO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

AYE GLAZER AYE WESSEL. AYE HUESO HAI JONES. KAMLAGER MELENDEZ. PORTANTINO RIGHT PORTANTINO HI RUBIO HI RUBIO AYE WILK. THE BILL HAS TEN VOTES WILL PLACE A BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU CENTER. I WILL NOT HEAR THE PRESIDING DUTIES TO OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR NIELSEN- HE WILL NOW PROVIDE INSIGHT- TAKE UP MY BILLS. WE GET IS MIKE ON PLEASE. PARDON THERE YOU GO. I DON'T ONE THAT'S YOUR FIRST ONE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON THE ANALYSIS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS OKAY. BUT OBJECTION IT WILL BE ADOPTED. AS ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE OF EARLY LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC PROVIDING REGULATORY RELIEF FOR ALCOHOLIC LICENSE- BY ALLOWING RESTAURANTS THE ABILITY TO SELL BOTH PRE PACKAGED ALCOHOL DRINKS IN PRE MIXED DRINKS TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF ITS TO GO MEAL ORDER. SB THREE EIGHTY NINE BUILD UPON THAT REGULATORY BILL RELIEF BY ALLOWING A HOLDER OF AN ON SALE RETAIL LICENSE WHICH INCLUDES RESTAURANTS AND BARS. THE ABILITY TO SELL BOTH PRE PACKAGED ALCOHOLIC DRINKS IT PRE MIXED DRINKS FOR CONSUMPTION OFF THE LICENSED PREMISES. UNLIKE THE REGULATORY RELIEF. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF A DRINK TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A MEAL THIS IS BECAUSE THE REGULATORY RELIEF. THIS THE BECAUSE UNDER THE REGULATORY RELIEF THIS IS A SIMPLY DONE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A RESTAURANT IN A BAR. THE MEAL REQUIREMENT ALSO HAS PROVED TO BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE ANSWERS NO CLEAR GUIDANCE ON WHAT ENCOMPASSES A MEAL. HOWEVER THIS BILL INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE REGULATORY RELIEF. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CONTAINER BE SEALED IN A MANNER THAT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT CONSUMPTION WITHOUT THE BREAKING OF THE SEAL. AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WOULD ALSO REQUIRE CONTAINERS TO BE CLEARLY LABELED OR OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING ALCOHOL. BOTH THESE NUMBERS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT CLEARLY IDENTIFY. THESE CONTAINERS INTO EASILY DETERMINE IF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BROKEN THE SEAL AND CONSUMED ANY OF THE ALCOHOL. IN ADDITION THE MY OFFICE IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS FOR EXAMPLE MY STAFF IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ADD. LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD FURTHER PROTECT AGAINST THE DELIVERY OF ALCOHOL TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. EXCUSE ME. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. IT THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES ANY LAWS RELATED TO DRINKING AND DRIVING OR DRINKING IN PUBLIC THERE'S ALSO NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT FORCES ANY LICENSEE TO ACTUALLY DO THIS THIS BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESSES THAT WERE RAVAGED BY COVERT NINETEEN. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESSES THAT DID THEIR PART IN STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THE STATE'S DEADLY VIRUS EVEN IF IT MEANT SACRIFICING THEIR LIVELIHOOD I BELIEVE THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REPAY SOME OF THAT SACRIFICE YEAH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY HERE WITH ME IS MATT SUTTON WITH A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND DAVID HOUSTON OWNER OF. BARNEY'S DEANERY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE WILL THEN PROCEED TO YOUR SUPPORT WITNESSES WE HAVE MISTER SUTTON. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MET CERTAIN OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION YOU CONSIDER LOTS OF BILLS LOTS OF GOOD BILLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PRACTICE BEFORE WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A BILL THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE THE POLICY. THE UNDERLYING POLICIES BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER A YEAR DUE TO THE ABC RELAXATION OF REGULATIONS ON THIS TOPIC AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC THE FIRST ENTITIES TO BE CLOSED FOR ALL ON SITE DINING RESTAURANTS AND SO TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY WERE THE ONLY OPTIONS FOR RESTAURANTS. THAT ACTUALLY CONTINUED THROUGH MOST OF LAST YEAR WE HAD AN ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN- ABILITY TO DINE ON SITE- BUT LARGELY WE WERE ENCOURAGED IF NOT FORCED TO DO OFFSITE DINING. AND THE STATE PROTOCOLS FIFTEEN PAGES RESTAURANT OVER NINETEEN PROTOCOLS THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE TODAY PLACE A HIGH EMPHASIS ON DELIVERY AND TAKEOUT SO. SB THREE EIGHTY NINE HELPS ALIGN WITH THAT TO CHANGE RESTAURANT LANDSCAPE- CURRENTLY THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY WITH THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON CAPACITY AND IT LOOKS FORWARD BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AS WE'VE ALL DONE SOME PANDEMIC PIVOTING YOU PROBABLY NOTICED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN RESTAURANTS WITH. PRE ORDERING VIA TECHNOLOGY- ORDERING WITH A Q. R. CODE NO PHYSICAL MENUS IN MANY RESTAURANTS SOME RESTAURANTS YOU CAN ORDER YOUR FOOD AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT IT'S PREPARED WHEN YOU ARRIVE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED IN THE RESTAURANT LANDSCAPE AND ONE THING IS CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS IS CHANGED AS WELL. AND SO GOING FORWARD CONSUMERS HAVE A HIGHER RELIANCE ON ENJOYING THAT RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OFFSITE AT THEIR HOME OR OTHER LOCATIONS SB THREE EIGHTY NINE THE SENATOR DODD POINTED OUT COMES WITH A NUMBER OF PUBLIC SAFETY PROTECTIONS. THAT MAKE US HANDLE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES JUST THE WAY WE DO IN A RESTAURANT WITH EVEN MORE PROTECTIONS FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN OFF SITE. SO WE THINK THIS STRIKES A GREAT BALANCE I DEFINITE PROTECTS. SAY AND IT ALIGNS WITH THE FUTURE OF THE CHANGE RESTAURANT LANDSCAPE AND WE THANK YOU AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER SUTTON DO WE HAVE MISTER HOUSTON AVAILABLE. YES I'M HERE THANK YOU- MY NAME IS DAVID HOUSTON AND THE OWNER OF A BAR IS BEING RE- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBER MEMBERS I'M IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE EIGHTY NINE I DON'T KNOW THANK A SENATOR DODD FOR HIS- TOUGHER APPROACH ON THIS ISSUE- I DON'T TO TELL YOU. THAT THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN EXTREMELY ROUGH- IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. OUTSIDE OF PANDEMIC WE WERE ORDERED CLOSED. AND WE ARE ORDER TO EMPHASIZE. THE CURBSIDE PICK UP AND- TAKE AWAY. ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THIS WAS OF THE ABILITY TO SELL BEVERAGES WITHOUT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS. THAT FREQUENT RESTAURANT. CALLED REGULARS I GUESS THEY HAVE A MEAL THAT THEY LIKE AND THEY HAVE A BEVERAGE THAT THEY LIKE TO GET WITH THAT SO. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ORDER THE YOU KNOW THE STONE IPA ALONG WITH THEIR BURGER TO. BE SPECIFIC IT MORE COMPLETES THAT RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE THAT THEY WERE LACKING AND ENCOURAGES THEM. TO CONTINUE ORDERING AND THAT'S THAT. REVENUE SOURCE THAT WE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME- SB THREE NINE TAKES WHAT'S IN PLACE FOR IT IN IN PLACE PER YEAR AND JUST SEEKS TO MAKE IT OUT LAST THE PANDEMIC WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA. AND IT GIVES JUST THAT LITTLE BIT OF HELP TO RESTAURANTS THAT ARE GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING. REALLY OVER THE NEXT. THE ONLY KNOWS HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE BUT IT'S A VERY TOUGH DIFFICULT CLIMB BACK IN. TO WHERE WE ONCE WERE JUST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO SO. EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS AND- THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT HELP- I WOULD ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THREE NINE TODAY IT IT MODERNIZE ALCOHOL SERVICE IN RESTAURANTS AND ACKNOWLEDGES EIGHT. PERMANENTLY CHANGE RESTAURANT LANDSCAPE. IT REQUIRES TIGHT CONTROLS AND MOVES POLICY BOARD THAT IS PROOF HAS PROVEN TRACK RECORD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THIS IS CERTAIN AND- WILL LOOK UP IN THE GALLERY I DID ANYMORE INDIVIDUALS HERE PRESENT THAT WISH TO TESTIFY FROM THE GALLERY. J. NONE LETS GO TO ROOM. ONE TWELVE.

SHARE MEMBERS FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PAGE ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ALCOHOL PROBLEMS WE SUBMITTED OUR OPPOSITION LETTER WEDNESDAY LAST WEEK. I THINK WE MISSED THE DEADLINE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS BUT WE DID SENATE OPPOSITION- WE RECOGNIZE THAT KOHLI HAMMERED THE RESTAURANT AND BAR INDUSTRY DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR- BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE A PRETAX FOR PROVIDING A PERMANENT. NEW. MEANS OF DISTRIBUTING ALCOHOL. A RESTAURANT THE BARS. ABC HAS HAD A- IN ENFORCING THESE DELIVERIES. AND THEY HAVE HAD HUGE CONCERNS AND PROBLEMS THEIR OWN DATA- WITH THE INAPPROPRIATE US. PROVIDING ALCOHOL TO USE THAT HOMES AND OTHER ISSUES AND CONCERNS WITH THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS THEMSELVES- DELIVERING THESE PRODUCTS WE BELIEVE A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SYSTEM IS PROBABLY MORE RESPONSIBLE- SO YOU DON'T HAVE- RESTAURANTS IN THERE BUSBOYS OUT. WITH COCKTAILS TO GO SHOW FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE CHAIRS THANK. UP NEXT WE HAVE FIND THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SKIP ON BEHALF OF ALCOHOL JUSTICE. NO ONE CAN DENY THE IMPORTANCE OF ALCOHOL SALES TO RESTAURANTS BOTTOM LINE ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT COCKTAILS TO GO ARE A BAD IDEA TO THE STATE BOTTOM LINE- EVERSPIN- THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE LINKING THE DEATH AND INJURY FROM DRINKING AND DRIVING- THERE HAS BEEN A PROHIBITION ON COCKTAILS TO GO- WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY TO MAKE THIS A PERMANENT PRIVILEGE. FORTY TWO THE CDC CALIFORNIA ALREADY SUFFERS MORE ANNUAL ALCOHOL RELATED HARM THAN ANY OTHER STATE OVER TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ALCOHOL RELATED DEATHS. THIRTY FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL COSTS FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE COSTS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU STOP THIS BILL IN YOUR COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR THE OPERATOR ANYTHING.

TWO SEVENTY SEVEN ARCHULETA PLEASE PROCEED SIR. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU AND I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO SEVEN SEVEN. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN IS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME TO IMPROVE THIS IMPORTANT BILL. FOR TOO LONG OUR OMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY THE PERSISTENT SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE BOOMS AND BANGS AND WE HAVE REFERRED TO HIM AND SHAKING OF WINDOWS AND DOORS IN THE PATCH RUNNING. THROUGH THE NEIGHBOHOOD BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL AMATEUR FIREWORKS DISPLAYS. LOCAL FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN KEPT FROM OTHER DUTIES HAS THEY ARE BUSY RESPONDING TO RESIDENTS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE ILLEGAL AERIAL DISPLAYS AND SALVATORI EXPLOSIVES NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. THE RELENTLESS DISRUPTION TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES ARE DISRUPTIVE AND UNWELCOME BY EVERY COMMUNITY. DESPITE INCREASED ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC EDUCATION USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AND DEPLOYING DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS TO GO AFTER THESE THINGS THAT THESE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS AND THE PATROLS CAN'T SEEM TO DO THE JOB. TOTALLY THE BOTTOM OF A LEGAL AREA- ITEMS AND LOUD EXPLOSIVE REMAIN AT UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS. ON TOP OF ALL THIS AFTER SUCCESSFULLY FINDING. AND CONFISCATING ILLEGAL FIREWORKS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE THEM SHIPPED OUT OF STATE AND DISPOSE OF PROPERLY. EVEN WHEN WE WIN IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE LOSING. THIS IS WHY I'M I'M PROUD TO BRING FORTH SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY SEVEN AND TWO SEVENTY SEVEN. PRESENTS A SOLUTION TO GETTING ILLEGAL FIREWORKS OFF OUR STREETS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL AMONG OTHER THINGS EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF DANGEROUS FIREWORKS. REQUIRING AND REQUIRES THAT ANY SEIZE DANGEROUS FOR SAFER ST FIREWORKS BE MANAGED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. REQUIRES COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FEDERALLY APPROVED DANGEROUS CONSUMER FIREWORKS ARE SAFE AND SANE FIREWORKS THAT ARE SEIZED BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY ANY CALIFORNIA LICENSE FIREWORKS IMPORTER EXPORTER. AND FINALLY SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY SEVEN ALSO INCREASES ANNUAL LICENSING FEES PAID BY FIREWORKS IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS. THIS INCREASE WILL WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE VOLUME OF THE PRODUCT AND THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THEY IMPORT INTO THE STATE. FURTHERMORE THE BILL GIVES THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL THE AUTHORITY TO SELL ANY COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FIREWORKS SEES BACK TO THE LICENSE FIREWORK IMPORTER EXPORTER OR WHOLESALER IF THEY ARE IN GOOD STANDING. THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE TWO MECHANISMS WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR STATE AND LOCAL FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALLOWING US TO ENHANCE OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY SEVEN ALLOWS THE STATE TO FINALLY TAKE ACTION AGAINST UNWELCOME AND FRANKLY DANGEROUS USE OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND IF THEY WOULD PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO THIS TIME IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE A NO LINES COMING IN IN OPPOSITION WELL I. THANK THOSE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- TESTIFIED TODAY DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR NIELSEN. MR FOR MY ASK THE AUTHOR A QUESTION. HE'S UP THERE IT'S GENERAL ARCHER IS THERE ANY LIMITATION ON THE RAISING OF THE FIFTY- IS IT- THERE'S A SUNSET AND THE RAISING THE FEE ORDER THEY DESCRIBE HOW HOW HOW IS THE FEE RAISED FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND- TODD TRIED TO JUMP IN BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE FEE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT ISSUE. AND THE AMOUNT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT ISSUE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE FEE WE'RE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON ALL THE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS IN THE FEE IS JUST ONE ELEMENT. BUT THE DISPOSITION AND DISPOSAL TOGETHER AND BRINGING THIS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S AWARENESS THAT WE AS A STATE SENATE ARE TAKING ACTION TO STOP THIS ILLEGAL FIREWORKS AT ALL. OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE JUST AN UPROAR ABOUT. CENTER DIRECTOR A AND- THE CONCERN I HAVE IS OVER THE YEARS WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS CEDED. TO AGENCIES THE ABILITY TO ON THEIR OWN VOLITION REYES FEES. AT THE NOT HAVE TO DO IT SEPARATELY AND A NEW BILL- SO THAT WAS A CURIOSITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT IT'S THE CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'VE BEEN ARE THIS BILL IMMEDIATELY- RAISE SOME FLAGS IN TERMS OF MY- VIEW OF HOW WE NORMALLY REGULATE THINGS IN THE STATE AND IT JUST SEEMS. ODD TO ME THAT- OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD AND GAUGE IN THE RESELLING. OF CONFISCATED MATERIALS I KNOW IT HAPPENS WITH AUTOMOBILES AND- WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY IS ENGAGED IN THE- IN THE PROCESS OF COMMITTED A CRIME ANALYSTS SO IT'S NOT SO UNUSUAL BUT IN THIS CASE. IN THOSE CASES- THOSE MACHINERIES OR EQUIPMENT OR KIND OF AN ACCESSORY WHEREAS THIS. THE ACTUAL ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE- WHICH IS THE. THE FIREWORKS IS ACTUALLY BEEN- SET BACK INTO THE MARKET SO WE'RE SELLING THINGS THAT ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OUR STATE. TWO OTHER STATES AND IF THEY'RE NOT AUTHORIZED IN OUR STATE WHAT WERE THEY DOING IN OUR STATE TO BEGIN WITH. AND IF THEY GOT HERE ILLEGALLY WHAT HOW DO HOW CAN WE CONTROL AND I KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE THE REALLY ABILITY TO CONTROL. WEATHER SOMETHING IS BROUGHT INTO OUR STATE BUT WE'RE BASICALLY HAVING TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WHICH CONTINUES THIS- THIS. CIRCLE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND IT'S JUST BASICALLY INCREASING THE SUPPLY. OF THESE BANNED SUBSTANCES IS A REASON WHY THE COMMUTER STATE BECAUSE VERY LUCRATIVE AND WELL WERE. SENDING THEM BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING HIM HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING COSTS SO- I THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT THE BILL THAT JUST RAISE FLAGS TO ME I KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROVISION THAT WILL. THE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING O LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM SIXTY FIVE. PERCENT COMING TO THE STATE WILL BE REDUCED 225% SO THE STATE NOW WILL HAVE LESS MORE BILL- LESS MONEY TO ENFORCE BUT IT'LL PASS IT ON TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I THINK THAT'S FAIR. BUT WHEN THE STATE IS LARGELY. HE- FUNDING THIS AND SOME OF THOSE- LAWS ARE LARGELY LOCAL. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE- A RECIPE FOR FAILURE AND I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED. AT THIS BILL IS JUST KIND OF MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE SO I JUST WANTED TO. I KNOW- MY COLLEAGUES TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM HERE AND HE'S BEING CREATIVE AND I APPLAUD THAT. I THINK GENERALLY OF HAVING MORE REVENUE WOULD MAKE SENSE BUT- ADDING TO THE SUPPLIER DOESN'T SO. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CONTROL- VALUE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SELL THIS BACK TO OTHER STATES A LOT OF THEM ARE BORDER STAKES STATES. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THE SUPPLIES NOT JUST GONNA BE TRAFFIC BACK INTO OUR STATE AND LET LET LET'S HEAR FROM OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT ON DO YOU GUYS LIKE JOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE CENTER OR TO LET IT. YES YOU HAVE A- THE TODD. JUMP IN ON THIS. BUT SENATOR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN ONCE AGAIN THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO RECEIVE AND COMPLICATE THE THESE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. AND THE DISTRIBUTION THERE AND TRANSPORTATION. TO OTHER STATES. THAT IS WITHIN THE LAW. AND BUT AS FAR AS THE RECEIVING OR IMPORTING. OF THE FIREWORKS THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE. THAT I THINK THE FIRE MARSHAL IN AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ARE ALSO TRYING TO STOP. AND SO I THINK IN THE FUTURE PERHAPS YOU CAN WORK WITH ME AND- AND OF COURSE- ARE SENATORS THAT. REPRESENT THE COASTAL AREA THE STOP THE SHIPMENT. OF SOME OF THESE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. THAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE- SO IN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAD MENTIONED TODD TROUT- WOULD YOU JUMP IN PLACE. YOU ALSO HAVE THIS TO REBEL ON FOR TECHNICAL ISSUES IN IN CENTER HUESO ONE OTHER THING. IT THE. THE MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT SENDING THESE. BILL FIREWORK INTO THE STATE. WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR THE TECH TO GO EXPERTEN. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR FOR IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE FIRE MARSHAL IS IN SUPPORT AS WELL. MISTER ADEL. YES YES. FIGURE NUMBER ONE THE THIS BILL ALSO ADDS PROVISION BID AT ANY LICENSED THE- PYROTECHNIC PLACE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PERSON. IN ANY WAY. THE ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF. THE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS INTO CALIFORNIA. IS THE SUBJECT OF LOSS OF THEIR LIVES NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- THE BILL RESTRICTS. THE FIREWORKS FROM BEING. SHIPPED TO OR JUST DISTRIBUTED IN A STATE CONTIGUOUS. TO THE STATE OF CAL. HELLO THIS IS TROUT AGAIN LET ME IN ALL KNOWN THE STATE THAT ARE CONTIGUOUS CALIFORNIA A LOT. AERIAL TYPE FIREWORKS THE FOR SOME THAT HAVE BEEN RESERVE. WHERE THEY ABLE TO SELL THAT- THE MID OF THE STATE OR THE MIDDLE IN THE EAST ALLOW AERIAL TO SO. THIS CALL WOULD GO BACK TO THOSE STATES WHERE THERE LEGAL AS FAR AS ADDING TO THE SUPPLY. THE WHO ARE TRACK- ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE VERY WELL. AND VERY WELL OR- AND WILL STILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT- BILLS FOR TO- AND- TO BE SOLD INTO. SO REALLY DOESN'T ADD TO THE SUPPLY BECAUSE PRODUCTS WILL GO BACK IT JUST WHERE THEY WILL BE SOLD BY THOSE OF US ARE ARE- LICENSE IN IN. THE OTHER THING TO I THINK IT'S IT IN IS IT'S WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND SO. REDUCE IT IS THROUGH AN- MISTER FARM MARSHALL OFF BUT UNDER FUNDED FOR YEARS- AND THEN UNDERS. TWO ABLE TO DO WHAT NEED TO BE DONE TO STOP THE FLOW OR LEAST MAY. THE OF THE LEGALS WE HAVE A MOBILE CHAMPAGNE FIRE EVER GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH FARM ARE OFFICE WANTED CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE ENFORCEMENT THE MORE MONEY THAT OUT TO THIS- OF THAT PLEASE LET MONEY AND FOR. ANALYSTS MY FOR IT. SO THIS IS THE SAME TO BE A AT SO TO A AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING ON SPOILS AND HERB MONEY TO GO TO JAIL TO MOURN FOR MY AND MORE- IT. AN EXPLOSION OF A HOUSE SO OBVIOUSLY THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE IN SUPPORT. BUT TO ASK SPECIFICALLY- TO DROUGHT DID YOU OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE FIRE MARSHAL. YES WE HAVE. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU THAT THAT SATISFIES ME JUST SOME CLOSING COMMENTS SAY I HAVE I HAVE NOT I THINK LOTS OF CALIFORNIANS DEAL WITH THIS- AND ESPECIALLY OF FIREWORKS ARE USED WITHOUT A PERMANENT LEGALLY I- ONE DAY A NEIGHBOR WAS EXPLODING FIREWORKS IN ONE FELL IN THE BACK OF MY YARD. SAN DIEGO IS SAYS PARTICULARLY OF. PRETTY BIG HOT SPOT ALL MY ALL MY DISTRICT WITH MEXICO AND OF COURSE IN MEXICO LOTS OF PRODUCT IS BROUGHT IN. ILLEGALLY INTO CALIFORNIAN THAT ADDS TO THE SUPPLY AS WELL SO- ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO- PROPERLY REGULATE THIS AND INFORM PEOPLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO CAN THEY CALL. IN IN THE- IN THE- AREA- IN THE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S ILLEGALLY EXPLODING. OF FIREWORKS I MEAN. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC I MEAN LAST TIME I HAD THIS. PROBLEM I CALLED THE POLICE IN THE PROBLEM DIDN'T. WASN'T WASN'T. AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF. WAY TO RESERVE RESOLVE- THESE THESE COMPLAINTS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR STATE SO. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- REPLIED MY CONCERNS AND HOW HOW SUPPORT BILL TODAY. THAT'S A LARGE LETTER WOULD YOU TO CLOSE. WE HAVE ANOTHER. YES THAT'S I DIDN'T SEE YOUR HAD A THAT'S OKAY YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I JUST. WANTED TO SEE BACK TO THE CORE THAT WAS PUT BY NEW BECAUSE DON'T I'M NOT CLEAR ON WHAT THE WAS THERE IS A FEE- AND FEEDER IS BEING. AND THEN THERE'S ALL A FEE WHERE THE CAP IS BEING. I KNOW THERE'S CONCERN. ABOUT THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL SO I- IF THE GOOD SENATOR KIDS TO THE TO SPUR IS BE- YOU KNOW REMOVING A CAP OF COURSE- ALWAYS BECAUSE CONCERN THAT SOME. YOU KNOW IT'S TO CAUSE A FINANCE HARDSHIP FOR THOSE WHO RELY ON THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS FOR THEIR COMMUNITY- EVENTS AND FUNDRAISING AND I ALWAYS HAVE A CONCERN WHEN THERE IS. NO CAP AT ALL ON A FEE BECAUSE IT CALLS INTO QUESTION HOW YOU. ARRIVE AT THE AMOUNT THE FEE IS SET TO BEGIN WITH SO M. IF THE AUTHOR COULD ADJUSTED THAT WAY I WOULD. APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR. PER SHARE ME. AND PLEASE YES. A OUR CONCERN IS. THE INFO. CONFERENCE OF THE LEAGUE FIRE. THE FEES OVERHEAD TURNED OVER TO- TALK. TO A SEC. BUT WHATEVER WE CAN DO. TO BRING DE THE USE. OF THE- FIREWORKS THIS IS WORK WE'RE TRYING DO- AND A LOT OF A IN OUR TO. YOU HAVE THE SCOUTS. AND DIFFERENT CIVIC GROUPS. THAT RELY ON SO AND SANE. FOR TO- REYES FUNDING SOMEONE. THE IS NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE AT THE- FOR. INTO TAKE ACTION WITH. THE MAIN THING. WITH IN REFERENCE THE FEE SH- TROUT- OR DINNER REVEAL YOU HAVE AN- COM OF COURSE ARE ON THAT. YES YES IS THIS IS DENNIS WILL- THERE ARE. TWO FEES THAT ARE DRESSED IN MISSOULA. ONE IS THE P. THAT IS FOR THE TEST- PRODUCTS AS THE ARE EITHER OR OR NOT BECAUSE FIVE AS STATE FARM SAID. RICHARD UP TO SPEED WITH THE PRACTICE THE SECOND FREE. THIS CONTEMPLATED MID IN THIS LEGISLATION OR DISCUSSED IS THE FREE ON IMPORTER EXPORTERS AND WHOLESALERS ONLY NOT ON THE RETAIL PERMITS ISSUED TO THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND THAT THAT PREVIOUS FUND THE LOCAL. THE FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. PERSONNEL ON THE PROPER HANDLING STORAGE AND PROCESSING FIREWORKS. THE BASIS IN THEIR JURISDICTION. SO COULD I JUST FOLLOW UP AND- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THERE REASON THAT THERE IS. NO NO CAPITAL I MEAN WHY WHY WAS THE CAP REMOVED IS THERE IF THERE IS AN ISSUE OF THE COST NEEDING TO BE INCREASED- I'D I'D CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT WOULD COME FROM BUT THE CAP HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED MEANING THERE'S NO CEILING WHATSOEVER AND I WONDER. WHY THE BILL IS STRUCTURED THAT WAY IF THE AUTHOR WOULDN'T MIND- ADDRESSING THAT. IN ONCE AGAIN I'M GOING TO DEFER TO- OUR OUR- THAT DEBT TRAP AND A DENVER BILL. BUT AGAIN- I HAD POINTED OUT THAT THE FEES WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE VOLUME. OF THE PRODUCT IN THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THAT ARE IMPORTED. SO THAT AND THAT IS THE MAIN ISSUE BUT- DENISON- TED PLEASE JUMP IN. BY THE END OF OKAY AGAIN IT- THERE CERTAINLY THERE'S NO REASON WHY TAP CAN'T BE PUT ON- THE- TESTING FOR YOUNG ON THE PRODUCT. IT IS NOW IT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IT'S FIFTY DOLLARS PER ITEM WHICH TESTED- WERE IN THE PAST BY STATUTE STEM- SO YOU CAN SEE ON WHICH IS INCREASE THE SENSE. THE LEGISLATURE WAS FIRST CREATED- AS FOR- THE- FREE ON THE IMPORTER EXPORTER AND WHOLESALERS- BUT A- THAT IS LEFT UP TO THE STATE FARM MARSHALL SAID THAT. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE COST OF THAT PREMIUM IS- QUESTION. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED JONES YEAH SO I JUST WANNA VERIFY IF I HEARD CORRECTLY ON THAT LAST STATEMENT THAT THE FEE IS BASED ON THE ACTUAL COST OF RECOVERY SO THERE IS THERE IS A THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN THE FEE AND THE ACTIVITY IN THE AND THE FEE IS CONSTRAINED BY THAT THE ACTUAL COST OF THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ACT. IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. IT'S THE COST OF THE RAINING ACTIVITY- THE DREAMS BILL CONTEMPLATES A NEW FUND FOR- TRAINING OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PERSONNEL ON THE PROPER. WAYS TO SEIZE HANDLES THE STORAGE AND CRISIS THE FIREWORKS THE BUSY SEASON THEIR JURISDICTIONS IT WOULD ALL BE PART OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN CALGARY. REGIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM THAT THEY ALREADY PROVIDE ON A VRIETY OF SUBJECTS OF THIS COULD JUST BE ONE NEW COMPONENTS ADDED TO THAT- CRISIS THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE BUT IT WOULD. BE SPECIFIC TO THE- PROPER HANDLING OF CEASE FIRE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THE FEES IMPORTANT IS KINDA YOU KNOW IT IT TIPPING POINT FOR SOME OF US- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY FOR THE- AUTHOR TO. YOU KNOW PUT OUT SOME INFORMATION THAT. KIND OF CONDENSES ALL THIS DISCUSSION INTO ONE IN A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT ARE EASIER TO EASY TO DIGEST SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES I THINK THAT- THE AUTHORS HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE DONE WHEN THE- WHEN THIS THING COMES BACK- TO THE FLOOR IF IT SHOULD PASSED TODAY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NOT AT FIRST I WANT TO START BY THANKING- THE- COMMITTEE- AS WELL AS- MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR- WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON. THIS LEGISLATION FOR HELPING US CRAFTED IN REFINERY PRE SHOULD OF THE TIME AND ENERGY COMMITTEE HAS PUT INTO WORKING WITH US. SENATE BILL THREE FOURTEEN IS ONE OF TWO BILLS I'M AUTHORING THIS YEAR TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL RESTAURANTS AND BARS TO ENSURE THEY'RE ABLE TO RECOVER ECONOMICALLY AFTER THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS I THINK EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY KNOWS HOW TO PANDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND PARTICULARLY IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND ALARMING RATE SINCE THE FIRST DAY AT HOME ORDER THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS SUSTAINED THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC TO. CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO REGAIN WHAT WAS LOST SO MANY OF CLOSE BARS RESTAURANTS CAFES ATTAINMENT MENUS AND FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE SURVIVED MANY ARE HANGING ON BY THEIR FINGERNAILS. EVEN NOW RESTAURANTS AND BARS CONTINUE TO TOGGLE BETWEEN BEING OPEN OR CLOSED OR LIMITED CAPACITY OR INDOOR OUTDOOR IT'S A CONSTANT SHIFT AND WE NEED TO DO THIS FOR THE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S BEEN VERY HARMFUL TO THESE BUSINESSES SO MANY HAVE CLOSED PERMANENTLY AND SO MANY ARE SUFFERING. SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY MORE THAN A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND A CHUNK OF THAT OUR SERVICE. WORKERS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. OCTOBER NINETY A LIMITED A STATE SOURCE OF INCOME THIS PART- AND WE NEED TO GET THIS INDUSTRY. CONTACT RESTAURANTS AND BARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE IN NEED OF FLEXIBILITY- WITH SOME OF OUR STATE ALCOHOL LAWS SINCE SOME OF THESE LAWS ARE ANTIQUATED. MANY OF THESE WERE WRITTEN A LONG TIME AGO AND JUST SIMPLY NEED TO BE UPDATED AND- THIS IS NOW AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DO THAT. BUT WHEN THE DUST SETTLES OF THE PANDEMIC MANY OF OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONE STEP AWAY FROM CLOSING- AND USING THESE RULES WILL HELP THEM RECOVER. SB THREE FOUR TEAM PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL RESTAURANTS AND BARS IN SEVERAL WAYS- FIRST- WE KNOW THAT- THE- OUTDOOR DINING EXPANSION THAT EDC AUTHORIZED AS PART OF AN EMERGENCY ORDER. HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS IT HAS ALLOWED CITIES AND ALL OF THIS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF CITIES- TO- EXPAND OUTDOOR DINING- IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED SO MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES TO SURVIVE- AND THAT ACTIVATED PUBLIC SPACES- IN A VERY VERY POSITIVE WAY AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO HAD NEVER REALLY SEEN THIS BEFORE IN OUR STATE- HAVEN'T REALLY BECOME THROUGH THE I. SIX SUPPORTERS IN MANY COMMUNITIES WANT TO CONTINUE- THIS OUTDOOR- EXPERIENCE. LARA AND SO THE BILL- WILL. AUTHORIZE ABC TWO EXTENDS THE OUTDOOR DINING- PROVISIONS FROM THE EMERGENCY ORDER- MINE AFTER THE END OF THE STATE OR- AND I WILL THEN CREATE SPACE FOR THESE BUSINESSES- TO APPLY IF THEY CHOOSE. TO MATE- THAT- LICENSE EXPANSION BOB PERMANENT RATHER THAN FORCING THEM TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL JUST AS THEY ARE RECOVERING DO IT- TO COMPLETE THAT PROCESS BEFORE THE END OF THE STATE EMERGENCY ACTIVISM- AN EXTRA TWELVE MONTHS- AND IF THEY HAVE THEIR APPLICATION AND BY THE END OF THE TWELVE MONTHS. IT C. CAN CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE UNTIL THE LICENSE UNTIL THE APPLICATION. IS DISPOSED OF. I SEE SOME OF LOCATION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT. MORE FREQUENTLY- IT ALSO CREATES SOME ADDITIONAL TIMING FLEXIBILITY- FOR- FOR- ONE TIME EVENTS ARE FOR LIMITED ADVANCE- ONE OF BEEN YOU LOOK AT OUR TEAM AND THEN YOU- IS APPLYING. FOR PARTICULAR- DE. UM AND THEN THESE CHANGES ARE COLLEAGUES ARE I THINK OUR CALL SO. GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL OUT IN THE STREET OR THE GIVES MORE FOR- AND I RESPECT ASK FOR I DO. OUT WITH ME TODAY.

I KNOW THE NUMBER OF LOCATION AND ACTUALLY PUBLIC SPACES IN ALREADY. GREEN BAY DEFICIENT COMMUNITIES WITH POOR PUBLIC WALKWAYS THIS IS DEFINITELY A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS IS A THREAT FOR SAFETY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS IS BEING PROMOTED HOW THIS IS PROMOTING MORE OUTDOOR DRINKING WHERE PEOPLE THAT ARE CHOOSING TO BE SOBER NOW ARE BEING EXPOSED TO IT THROUGH ADVERTISING.

FOR THE BILL. MISTER IT ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS CENTER MELENDEZ. I'M THINKING CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO MAKE COMMON AND THANK AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I THINK THAT- THE LAST YEAR HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THE BUSINESS'S CAN OPERATE AND CERTAINLY THESE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES LICENSEES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN OPERATE LEGALLY AND SAFELY IN THIS MANNER AND I SEE NO REASON WHY THEY CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO SO. GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD- THE HOST OF PROBLEMS THAT SOME MIGHT SUGGEST ARE TO COME IN THE FUTURE SO WITH- WITH THAT I DO WANT TO OFFER MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW ONE THING THE- WHOLESALERS DISTRIBUTORS WHO IT CALLED AND- ABOUT THAT SHARING ARRANGEMENT AND SPECIFICALLY IT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO IMPACT THE TIED HOUSE LAWS.

NOW WILL MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE SB SEVEN NINETY THREE CENTER WINNER YOU MAYBE GET- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- AND AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON- THIS BILL THESE ORINDA IT IS A GOING TO BE ONE BILL IN THE COMMITTEE I THINK WISELY BECAUSE THIS IS SPLIT. INTO TWO BILLS ARE TO MAKE IT'S ONE MORE MANAGEABLE WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- AND I SAYS SB SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH IS THE SECOND. RELIEF BILL- FOR OUR HOSPITALITY SECTOR- IN LIGHT OF COATED SIDE SPECIFIC- TWO OR IT REALLY FOCUSES ON A LIVE MUSIC VENUES. AND SO DOES A FEW THINGS FIRST- CREATE OUR LIVE MUSIC VENUES OF COURSE- IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUFFERING OF RESTAURANTS AND BARS. LIVE MUSIC VENUES ARE ABOUT THREE NOTCHES ABOVE THAT IN TERMS OF SUFFERING- THEY COULD THEY SHUT DOWN THE MINUTE THE SARTED THE PANDEMIC- AND THEY HAVE YET TO REOPEN- THEIR DAY ON LIKE THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE AT LEAST BEEN ABLE TO PARTIALLY REOPEN A PERIOD OF TIME. LIVE MUSIC VENUES ARE JUST REALLY AT RISK- THEY'VE GOTTEN SOME RELIEF FROM CONGRESS WHICH IS GREAT- BUT WE REALLY LET'S TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM RECOVER QUICKLY. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ALMOST I THINK AROUND NINETY- ALCOHOL LICENSE TYPES IN CALIFORNIA WITH US YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALCOHOL LICENSE TYPE SPECIFIC TO LIVE MUSIC VENUES OF A HAVE TO SHOEHORN. INTO ANOTHER KIND OF LICENSE AND THEY FREQUENTLY WILL DO THAT. THE BEST PATTERSON CURRENTLY IS TO GET ON A RUN A FULL RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A FULL KITCHEN- OR YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT A RESTAURANT- AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS ACCOUNTING FOR SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD OUT A COMPLETE KITCHEN- BUT SECOND IT REALLY LIMITS THE KINDS OF SPACES. BUT A LIVE MUSIC VENUE CAN GO INTO BECAUSE OF ITS NOT OF THIS WILL NOT COMEDY A FULL RESTAURANT KITCHEN- THEY- REALLY CAN GOING LIVE YOU. IS SUCH AND PART OF OUR CULTURE- AND- IN OUR CITIES AND THE DISTANCE ELISE CHRISTODOULIDES SENDS. FOR THE LIVE MUSIC VENUES IT'LL THE FEE WON'T GO DOWN- BUT IT'LL JUST CREEK GIVE THEM. SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY WE SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO- THE OTHER. PIECE OF THIS BILL- IS IT. HAS TO DO WITH- THE SORT OF THE CITIZENS OPEN CONTAINER LAWS. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT INVENTING THE CONCEPT OF OPEN CONTAINERS OWNS FOR CITIES IF THEY CHOOSE THEY CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT IT IS DOING IS CREATING MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT OUR LOCAL BARS AND RESTAURANTS. IT OPENED HIS OWN CONVERTED TO PAID. TO BE CLEAR THE CURRENT LAW. ALLOWS CITIES TO AUTHORIZE OPEN CONTAINER SO IF THE CITY HAS A STREET FESTIVAL OR A- FESTIVAL IN THE TOWN SQUARE THEY DESIGNATE AND AN AREA OF THE CITY. AS SOME SORT OF ENTERTAINMENT ZONE. I CITY RIGHT NOW CAN ALLOW OPEN CONTAINERS AND THAT'S BEEN THE LAW FOR. FOREVER OR NOT FOREVER BUT. YOU KNOW GOING BACK DECADES AND DECADES. THE WAY IT HAS TO HAVE NOW. IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A- COME IN AND GO TO TEMPLE ALCOHOL PERMITS AND SELL FROM. A STANDARD OR A TRUCK OR WHATEVER. AND EVEN IF THERE'S A BAR RESTAURANT THAT'S LITERALLY RIGHT THERE IN THE ZONE. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE AND SELL AN OPEN HAVE SOMEONE TAKE OUT OF YOUR BEER OR WHATEVER. AND SO THE OUTSIDE VENDORS CAN COME IN AND OUT OF IT. BUT THE BAR RESTAURANT THAT'S RIGHT THERE AND IS INTEGRATED INTO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CANNOT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS TO SAY WHEN YOU CREATE AN OPEN CONTAINER ZONE FOR YOUR ANNUAL PARADE OR STREET FESTIVAL OR WHATEVER- IF YOU CAN THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BOOK AN AUTHORIZED. THE BARS AND RESTAURANTS RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE. AS WELL SO IT'S NOT CREATING THE IDEA OF AN OBJECT CONTAINERS ON. BUT IT'S ALLOWING OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES- TO PARTICIPATE THOSE BARS AND RESTAURANTS OF COURSE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT- BUT THEY'LL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT VIOLATING. OTHER LIQUOR LICENSE- AND AGAIN THIS IS TOTALLY IN THE DISCRETION. OF CITIES THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT DISCRETION OVERSIZED ALLOWING THEM TO ALLOW THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. TO PARTICIPATE BY SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME- ENERGETIC. OVER THE PHONE LINE TODAY TO TESTIFY. IS ALEX TO AS REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT VENUE ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I BELIEVE HE'S IN THE HOUSE AND ALWAYS IN THE HOUSE OF MY GOD. POLICE ARE SEEKING THE STORES.

THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE BRING BACK THESE TOURISM DOLLARS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

STREAMERS FROM THAT FOR TRAFFIC FOR ALL OF THAT ACTIVE SO. OFF RELIEF A FOR VENN.

SB SEVEN NINE THREE WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROVIDING REGULATORY RELIEF FOR HUNDREDS OF VENUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

AND I HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR- DO ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL FEDERAL HUESO. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE OFF FIRST OF ALL I WANNA I WANT TO STATE THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL MUCH NEEDED BILL. AND IT'S WAY OVERDUE SO I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. HI I DO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE AUTHOR HOWEVER. I DO HAVE A RECOGNITION TO THE SENATE AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS A WHOLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IS ANY. LOOK AT HOW THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HANDLES APPOINTMENTS TO JUDGES. AND SINCE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN. SOME ELEVEN OR TWELVE APPOINTMENTS OF- LATINOS SHOULD THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH IS A BODY OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO PEOPLE. IF THAT BODY WAS CURRENTLY REFLECT OF THE CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST. EIGHT TO ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT ARE OF LATINO DESCENT. HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN ELEVEN IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY TWO I THINK THAT IS. A WARRANT AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND I THINK WE NEED TO. HOLD THE JUDICIAL BRANCH'S ACCOUNTABLE- AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON MAKING OF THESE IMPORTANT APPOINTMENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO. APPOINT PEOPLE TO THESE COMMISSIONS INTO THESE BOARDS THAT REFLECT THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE OUR COURTS. HAVE JUDGES IN IN HIGH OFFICES AND HAVE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT SIDE. HOW THE COURTS ARE RUN AND HOW POLICY IS MADE NOW PEOPLE ARE HIRED THERE ARE ALSO REFLECTIVE. OF THE OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE NOT NOT I'M JUST NOT TALKING ABOUT LATINOS AND TALKING ABOUT ASIANS AFRICAN AMERICANS. PEOPLE OF THAT RECALL OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE MORE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT THAT THE I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF TALENT IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY AND WE HAVE TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT HARDER. ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN SO A SUGGESTION TO THE AUTHOR PLEASE LOOK AT THIS BILL. AND WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE. TO INCLUDE. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH MAYBE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MAYBE THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES. IN THAT PROCESS AS WELL SO- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING IN THIS AREA AND- AND ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MR I'D LIKE TO ALSO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR- I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT SENATE BILL SEVEN OH TWO I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO- JUST THANK EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY- TO ENCOURAGE OUT REGION ARE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST FURTHER WE COULD KNOCK DOWN SOME OF THESE BARRIERS THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE AND I THINK THIS WORKING GROUP. WILL BE ABLE TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR ON THE NECESSITY TO FIND GOOD LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE BOARD GOING- INTO OUR COMMUNITIES TO FIND THAT DIVERSITY IN IT IS SO NECESSARY AND IF OBVIOUSLY DIVERSITY AND IN RACE AND GENDER IDENTITY CLASS RELIGION CREED AND EVERYTHING TO FEEL IT SO EVERYONE CAN FEEL PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND PART OF THE STATE AND THE GROWTH OF THE STATE. AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS OUT THERE I KNOW WE CAN FIND IT WE JUST NEED TO GET EVERY EVERYONE INVOLVED AND I CERTAINLY- ENCOURAGE A PASSING SENATE BILL SEVEN OLD TOO AND I WOULD BE- HONORED TO GO HEAD AND- MAKE THAT MOTION. THANK YOU SENATOR COME AUGUST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK AT THE APPRPRIATE TIME TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR YOU KNOW DATA IS IMPORTANT- AND WHILE WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FILLING SPOTS ON OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WITH APPOINTMENTS IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FILLING THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. DIVERSITY ON THEM IN A WAY THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU CANNOT DOTHAT I YOU DON'T HAVE DATA YOU CANNOT DO THAT IF YOU'RE NOT REVIEWING THE DATA AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU ARE NOT YOU KNOW BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER IN CONVENING OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE AS IT RELATES TO THESE APPOINTMENTS AND COMMISSIONS. SO THAT WE CAN DO BETTER FOR THE RESIDENTS AND CONSTITUENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL STRIVE TO DO AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH OUT OF MY COLLEAGUES- SENATOR HUESO ABOUT INCLUDING JUDICIAL COUNCIL I THINK THAT IS A VERY GOOD IDEA. ANYBODY ELSE. SO WE HAVE A- SEVERAL OWN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE OR DO WE HAVE IS A SKEWS ME CENTER LAMONT. WHO'S WITH YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WILL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD ON TO EVERYONE'S COMMENTS THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AS A- RELATES TO THE DATA.
