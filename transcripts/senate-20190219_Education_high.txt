WE CAN A WE'RE GONNA HEAR SB ONE TWENTY SIX SAYS CENTER LOS LEAVING YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU SENATOR WILK MISTER VICE CHAIR. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE COME TOGETHER ON THIS MEASURE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THEY CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY ISSUES. MEMBERS THIS MAYES REFLECTS OUR BICAMERAL RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR ACTION. THE CREATION OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WAS INTENDED TO SUPPORT LOCALLY DRIVEN EXPERIMENTATION TO PRODUCE BETTER ACADEMIC RESULTS THAT COULD BE EXPANDED AND THEN COULD BE EXPANDED TO ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FULL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS THEIR PUBLICLY FUNDED AND YET THEY LACK THE SAME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS THE GOVERNOR OTHER PUBLICLY FUNDED. INSTITUTIONS THIS BILL ENSURES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL COMPLY WITH THE SAME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY LAWS THAT ALL OF OUR OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS CURRENTLY FOLLOW. CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME OPEN MEETING CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND DISCLOSURE LAWS AS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARDS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT MEMBERS OF CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS ANNOT USE THEIR POSITIONS FOR PERSONAL OR POLITICAL GAIN. FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ATTEMPTED TO BRING CLARITY TO THIS ISSUE. FORTUNATELY OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN OPINION CLEARLY STATING THAT YES THESE GOOD GOVERNMENT LAWS DO APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS. FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED CLARITY ON WHETHER OR NOT THESE LAWS APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS. THE OPINION IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING. ABSENT THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY WHICH CODIFIES ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINIONS DISPUTE DISPUTES WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE OVER HOW THESE LAWS APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. MEMBERS THIS IS A FAIR DEAL AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE A LONG STANDING PROBLEM TO BENEFIT TO THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY TEACHERS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS LABOR AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. TO KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY THE CAL CSUS MAJOR AND A CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION IS NEUTRAL. I WILL NOW TURN OVER TO A SOMEONE RIGHT DONALD FOR HIS REMARKS. THANK YOU. MY HONOR. YOU ARE HIGH AND OKAY THANK YOU. I AM PLEASED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL IT APPLIES GOOD GOVERNMENT LOSS TO CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE LEARNING CENTERS NOT PROFIT CENTERS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THE USE OF OUR PRECIOUS FEW PUBLIC SCHOOL DOLLARS ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSPARENCY. COMMON ETHICAL PRACTICES AND GOOD GOVERNMENT LAW THAT IS APPLIED TO TWO OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS VERY RECENTLY VERY RECENTLY OPINED THAT THESE LAWS DO APPLY THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT THIS BILL PROVIDES ADDED CARITY. THIS BILL PROTECTS PRESAGE AT PRECIOUS EDUCATION DOLLARS WHICH SHOULD BE USED FOR STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS NOT TO LINE THE POCKETS OF CHARTER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. THE LIST OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH THE HISTORY OF FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT AS LONG CELERITY MAGNOLIA AND TRI VALLEY ARE SOME OF THOSE. UNTIL NOW THESE SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PUBLIC MONEY BUT NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND IN FACT HAVE ARGUED THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR TRANSPARENCY LAWS DO NOT APPLY TO THEM. WE SEEK TO CHANGES TODAY. LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO TRANSPARENCY AND ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR YEARS SO TOO SHOULD CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS. ARE -- I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL MASS OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS THANK YOU. HERE IN SUPPORT IS SETH BROWN BRAMBLE SORRY FIFTH AND WE HAVE A CTA CARLOS MACHADO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND CARLOS MARQUEZ. ON BEHALF OF CSSA. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATOR STUFF BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASE. PART SENATE BILL ONE TWO SIX AS A SIMILAR LEYVA MENTION CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE ESTABLISHED WITH THE PROMISE WILL GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM TO INNOVATE. YOU'LL SHOW US RESULTS LIKE LIGHTHOUSES THESE WERE PLACE WHERE YOU COULD DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. AND MAYBE WERE LEARN SOMETHING FROM WHAT WAS OCCURRING IN APPLIED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION I WAS. EXCITED IN A MEETING OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO HEAR FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL DIVISION IN OAKLAND UNIFIED. ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY CALL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER WITH THE PRINCIPLES THAT CHARTERS AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT -- NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS WILL COME TOGETHER AND SHARE LESSONS LEARNED AND THAT'S WHAT WAS INTENDED HERE BEST PRACTICES. BUT THE PEOPLE CANNOT LEARN FROM THIS INNOVATION IF THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN CHARTER SCHOOLS -- WAS NOT ABOUT US THE PUBLIC YIELDING CONTROL TO THE AGENCIES THAT SERVE US. WE'D NEVER INTENDED FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS STONE RETAINING CONTROL. AND ON THING INFORMED HAVING SECRET AND PRIVATE MEETINGS ABOUT HOW TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IS NOT INNOVATION THAT DOES NOT BENEFIT THE SYSTEM AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL MENTIONED IT'S RESULT IN A NUMBER OF HORROR STORIES. UNHAPPY TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND EXAMPLES OF THE COMMITTEE REQUESTS. ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IS DO WHAT YOU WANT BUT DO IT OUT IN THE OPEN WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE TRULY WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS IS DREAM BIG AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. BUT DON'T ABUSE THE PUBLIC TRUST AND SPEND THAT MONEY ON OUR STUDENTS PUBLIC EDUCATION MUST BE ABOUT KIDS NOT PROFITS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] IF YOU. GET AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CARLOS MACHADO WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. ONE TWENTY SIX SB ONE TWENTY SIX IS CONSISTENT WITH A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE A TASK FORCE THE CALIFORNIA ON SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION HAD. ISSUED A JUST RECENTLY ARE THIS IS THE FIRST RECOGNITION THAT REPORT THAT. THE STATUTES APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOL BOARDS -- SB ONE TWENTY SIX CLARIFIES THAT COMPETITION INNOVATION SHOULDN'T OCCUR AT THE EXPENSE OF A PARENTS STUDENTS PARENTS AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATION -- FULLY WITHIN THE DECISIONS OF THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS. MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS NOW ARE COMPLYING WITH THE STATUS MANY OF THEM HAVE AGREED -- TO CALLED AT A COMPLY WITH INVOLUNTARILY. THAT'S THROUGH -- THEIR WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THEIR AUTHORIZED -- TO GREET -- TO AND FOUR SEN AND COMPLY WITH THESE PROVISIONS -- AUTHORIZED ONLY DO SO MUCH IN TERMS OF HAVING THE PETITIONER -- FOLLOWED THE STATUTES AND SB ONE TWENTY SIX WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S COMPLIANCE -- ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- FOR THOSE PARENTS AND STUDENTS ARE TENDING CHARTERS AT THE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MEETINGS THAT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO RECORDS -- AND THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING THE CHARTER SCHOOL I DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLEX -- SO -- S. S. C. S. B. AS BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS -- WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND ALSO AS HE SEE A SAY IN THE PAST -- AND HAVING -- COMING VERY CLOSE TO REACHING -- AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST WERE HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME TABLE AND WE CAN REACH AGREEMENT ON THIS AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU WOULD. OF THOSE I ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU -- WELL FIRST THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM -- THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT AN EASY PROCESS -- BUT WE ARE VERY PROUD -- TO TO BE ABLE TO TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL TODAY THAT WE DO THINK -- THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE -- IS A BALANCED APPROACH THAT BOTH PRESERVES THE CORE I. TANAMI INFLEXIBILITY GRANTED TO CHARTER SCHOOLS UNDER THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO INNOVATE. WITH OBVIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW HE REQUIREMENT TO MANDATE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING OUR OUR BUSINESS OUR WORK IN THE LIGHT OF DAY AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DESN'T ALWAYS LEND ITSELF TO GETTING EVERYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE -- WHICH IN PART IS WHY WERE OR NOT DOT FULLY AECOM ONBOARD AS AS THAT AS HAVING A SUPPORT POSITION -- BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY MAJOR A REASONS WHY THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WERE ABSOLUTELY. EAGER -- TO TO CODIFY WHAT MR MACHADO SHARED -- SO MANY OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY PRACTICING EITHER. VOLUNTARILY OR AS A RESULT OF AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR AUTHORIZED ERRORS. AND WE HOPE THAT THAT CLARITY AND AT MORE COLLABORATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND CHARTERS. AND HOPEFULLY WILL WILL TAKE THIS CASUAL OFF THE TABLE -- ARE FOR OPPONENTS. TO YOU KNOW -- PERHAPS -- DE ESCALATE SOME OF THE RHETORIC AROUND -- CHARTER SCHOOLS BEING -- THE FOR PROFIT CENTERS AND OUR BOARD MEMBERS -- LOOKING TO GET INTO THIS AS THE WORK OF PUBLIC EDUCATION TO LINE THEIR POCKETS WEWE COULDN'T AGREE WITH THOSE -- THOSE ASSERTIONS -- AND WE CAN DISAGREE WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS MORE VEHEMENTLY SO -- HOPEFULLY AT SETTLING THIS AREA AND LAW WILL WILL PUT THOSE -- ALSO IT'S TO BAD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS -- IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRISTEN BROWN OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS INSTRUCTS FOR THIS BILL WE ALSO WOULD HOPE THAT IT DOES SPECIFY THAT THIS IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW JUST WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING WOULD BE NICE FOR TO SAY THAT AS WELL.

THANK YOU. WHY I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU WELL I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAD TO ME TO IT BUT YOU ALL DID? SO YOU. KNOW I GUESS COULD SAY THEY'RE OFTEN EDUCATION I DO HAVE A NIECE AS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. HE COME FORWARD. THEY REALLY WERE YOU WANT TO SET WELL [inaudible] FRIENDS HERE. CAROLYN -- HALLORAN WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND I APOLOGIZE I GOT MY LETTER IN LATE LAST NIGHT -- WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO TRANSPARENCY AYE WE ARE HOWEVER OPPOSED TO A FEW PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE WHEN THEY WERE IN OTHER MEASURES. AND THIS BILL IS NOT THE SAME AS THE CURRENT PROVISIONS THAT APPLY TO TRADITIONAL DISTRICTS. UNDER A COUPLE ITEMS AT ALL POINT OUT -- FOR INSTANCE -- THE ISSUE AROUND WHETHER OR NOT. I SAID ON A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL WHEREVER IN OUR DISTRICT WE WOULD LIKE TO MEET -- AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT INCREASES TRANSPARENCY WE NEED AT OTHER SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT WE NEEDED OUR CITY HALL WHERE -- IT'S AVAILABLE AND WE ALSO DON'T HAVE TO DO IT TO A TRANSMISSION -- AND AND WE THINK THAT PUTTING THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- BY NOT ALLOWING CHARTER SCHOOLS TO MEET AT SOME OF THEIR OTHER SITES. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE -- ANOTHER ISSUE -- IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAB THE BURDENS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY ON CHARTER SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR THE COSTS OF THE TO A TRANSMISSION THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY. AND THAT WOULD IN PARTICULAR BE THAT -- STATE MANDATED COST REIMBURSEMENTS -- AND THE LA -- JUST PUT OUT A REPORT -- I THINK ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THE MONTH. AND AND IT TALKS ABOUT ALL OF THE COSTS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ENTITLED TO THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT. FOR SO SO THOSE THINGS WE THINK OUGHT TO BE IN THERE FOR GOING TO START GOING DOWN THE PATH OF REALLY MAKING CHARTER SCHOOLS PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND LASTLY I THINK THAT -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE ANALYSIS. THE IDEA THAT WE TALK ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS ONLY HAVING -- BROWN ACT IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE AUTHORIZED YEARS IT WAS PART OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF OFF THE RISERS. IS REALLY STRONG LANGUAGE I WROTE A CHARTER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND I PUT THE BROWN ACT IN THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO BUSINESS. NO ONE FORCED ME TO DO THAT -- THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT FROM OFF THE RISERS SO I THINK THAT WE'RE JUST NOT LOOKING AT THE WAY CHARTER SCHOOLS REALLY OPERATE -- AND AND MAYBE TAKING SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT THE THREE CHURCH SCHOOLS YOU NOTED THAT HAD TO ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE AND THEY'RE ALL. DIFFERENT SO IT'S HARD TO APPLY SOMETHING SO BROADLY AS TO THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED -- AND AGAIN NOT OPPOSED TO TRANSPARENCY SO THAT'S A GOOD FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE I I'M. THE THIS CASE IS THAT THE SOME WOMEN LAID LAID OUT ARE PRETTY PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED LA LA TIMES MATERIAL HOW MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THERE IN THE STATE YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER CHARTER SCHOOLS REPRESENT ABOUT THERE'S ABOUT. THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHARTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY THERE'S ABOUT A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FAQ. YEAH ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. CASEY NINE WE WILL PULL IT BACK -- TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS MR GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR -- WELL I WANT -- TO I WANT TO THANK -- THE AUTHORS THE GOVERNOR STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS ISSUE THAT HAS HAD A A LITTLE BIT OF AN ESCALATED. TIMELINE BUT SOMETIMES I WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN AGREEMENT I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'D LIKE -- TO LIKE TO SETTLE IT AND I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THE THE COMMITTEE AND AND OTHERS ARE AWARE THAT. THIS IS AN AREA THAT I'VE HAD LEGISLATION AND FOR FOR A FEW YEARS CENTER ALLEN I BOTH. AUTHORED LEGISLATION ON OPEN MEETINGS AND DISCLOSURE CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES AND I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US -- MAYORS IN SOME CASES IDENTICALLY IT'S PROVISIONS AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I WOULD NOTE THAT -- ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION THAT'S PROVIDED IN THIS LEGISLATION -- ONE IN WHICH I SUPPORT. WHICH IS ACCEPTING TEACHERS -- FROM THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES -- AS LONG AS THEY DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL T!I. AT TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD CHANGE OF CURRENT. LAW IF YOU WILL -- BUT I THINK ONE THAT -- MAKES SENSE TO ME AND I'VE SEEN OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE WHERE WE'VE HAD TEACHERS AND FACULTY. ON BOARDS AND IT JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE IN PLACES THAT WOULD CREATE THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT HERE. I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW A LONG STANDING CONFLICTS IN THE SPACE. AND I KNOW THAT -- THAT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER ALL THOSE CONFLICTS. I THINK TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S CREDIT. HE'S ASKED THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS -- TO FORMULATED A TASK FORCE. TO TRY TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS AND I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT. IT WILL BE IT WILL BE DONE IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. I IN A TRANSPARENT WAY. THERE'S A LOT OF SCABS OUT THERE. AND SCARS. AND US WHAT'S MY HOPE THAT THE IN THE IN THE ACTION THAT WE TAKE TODAY WHICH SHALL BE SUPPORTIVE OF AND THE ACTIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS INITIATED REGARD THIS TASK FORCE. THAT -- IN THE COMING IN HERE AT LEAST THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME PEACE IN THE SPACE. AND THAT WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF SO IMMEDIATE ISSUES TODAY. OVER IN A FEW DAYS WHEN IT PASSES THE LEGISLATURE. AND WILL HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS IN THE SENSITIVE AREA -- WHERE THERE'S GOOD MEETING ON ALL SIDES TO TRY TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE KIDS IN? AS A WITNESS EARLIER HAD MEASURES LIKE THIS DON'T GET EVERYBODY EVERYTHING THAT THEY WANT IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE AND I CREDIT THE AUTHORS IN THE GOVERNOR. FOR ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT HERE. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME RELATIVE PEACE IN THE FACE FOR THE YEAR AHEAD AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK AND WORK OUT THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND A TWO ONE I THINK -- THE AUTHORS FOR BRING THIS -- BILL FORD AND ALSO ONE THING THE GOVERNOR AND THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS -- EL HAVING SERVED ON EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- FOR I GUESS THE PAST FOUR YEARS -- THIS IS BEEN IMPEDED ISSUE WHERE FRANKLY L. THERE WASN'T -- CLEAR LAW ABOUT -- CLOSURE AN OPEN MEETING AND I THINK I I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITHOUT. AND SO I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT -- WE'VE FINALLY COME TO SOME RESOLUTION ON THAT AND I ALSO WANT THANKED ATTORNEY GENERAL. FOR HIS OPINION AS WELL -- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE AGAIN LIKE MY GOOD FRIEND US ARE GLAZER THAT -- THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION I THINK IS CONVENING A GROUP -- AND THE I DON'T BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR IS ON BOARD WITH THAT AS WELL SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS -- WELL I CERTAINLY ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE COMING BEFORE EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT. VARIOUS ISSUES I ALSO HOPE THAT AS WE ARE ALL COMING TOGETHER TO TRY. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO THAT'S BEST FOR OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE -- FOR THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- WE WE WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE COUNTY ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE -- ALL OF OUR STUDENTS -- I HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN SPECIAL ED STUDENTS ARE ARE WELL SERVED. BY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN GIVE THIS -- A THIS. BODY A CHANCE TO ALSO -- YOU KNOW WAY AND AND AND AND WORK OUT SOME STUFF AND WORK OUT SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL AND LOOK FORWARD -- TO TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND IN TERMS OF OF BEING SURE THAT SO WE PUT OUR KIDS FIRST AND AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO AFFORD ON THAT SELF THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR BRAIN THIS BILL BEFORE US AND CERTAINLY I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THE CENTER PANEL. THIS -- UP BY -- TWO ONE TWO THANK THE GOVERNOR -- IN PARTICULAR FOR THE EXTRA PUSH THAT HE PUT INTO THIS AND AND TO TAKE IN A WORSE TODAY ANDA CENTER LEYVA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. FOR YOUR BEING A PART OF THAT TEAM TO MOVE IT FORWARD AND JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE AREA OF WHY I AM REALLY GLAD IN PARTICULAR THAT THIS IS BEING MOVED. IS -- I THINK IT'S A IT PRESENTS THE RIGHT STRENGTHENS THE RIGHT OF PARENTS. AND THEIR CHILDREN -- TO REPRESENT THEIR CHILDREN ON WHATEVER ISSUES COME BEFORE THE BOARDS AND I THINK THAT UNLESS PARENTS ANNA. FEEL THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION LAW AND THE ABILITY -- TO CHALLENGER ASK FOR THE INFORMATION THEN IT HOLDS THEM BACK UP AND I THINK UNLESS PARENTS AND THE FAMILIES ARE TRULY ENGAGED. THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION IS NOT GOING TO GET AS GREAT AS WE NEED IT TO BE SO ANYTHING THAT STRENGTHENS OUR RIGHTS I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE ALL MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS AND BUT I I AGREE YOU KNOW COULD JUST EVERYBODY YOU KNOW BEING INVOLVED I'VE SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONG WITH CENTER PANNING GLAZER AND AND CIVIC CENTER LEYVA AND WE'VE HAD SOME KNOCK DOWN. DRAG OUTS AND THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRUST ON BOTH SIDES WHICH I THINK IS BEEN UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST -- EVER CHILDREN I DO LIKE THE THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT I ALSO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE BY THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. WERE PLAN I CAN BE ABLE TO GET ANY OF THOSE ISSUES INTO THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE NEGOTIATED AS DELEGATE AND AS BALANCED BUT I HOPE THAT WE DO COULD I GO TAKE A BITE AT THE APPLE AT A LATER DATE ON ON SOME OF THOSE SO -- WITH THAT NO OTHER COMMENTS SO I'LL Là YOU TO CLOSE MADAM CHAIR. THE VICE CHAIR BY I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE WORK THATYOU SENATOR GLAZER IN CENTER ALLEN HAVE DONE ON IN THIS AREA IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND I THINK WE'RE JUST TO A DIFFERENT AND A UNIQUE MOMENT WHERE WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO -- AGREES WITH SOME OF THINGS YOU'VE WORKED ON AND WANTS TO GET THIS PROCESS STARTED I WOULD SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO START THE YEAR OFF MAYBE ON A BETTER FOOT -- THAN IN THE PAST AND I WOULD SAY IS SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE IF EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE BIT HAPPY OR A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY. THAT WE DID A GOOD JOB WE DIDN'T PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS AND I LOOK AT THIS BILL IN THAT LIGHT. AND THE TASK FORCE CAME UP A COUPLE TIMES WE I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT HOUSE FORCING TO MUCH INFORMATION.
