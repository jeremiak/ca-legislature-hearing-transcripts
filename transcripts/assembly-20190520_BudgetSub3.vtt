WHEN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.250
ACCOUNT TO WHICH IS ONE OF THE

00:41:59.316 --> 00:41:59.717
TSA'S.

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:01.952
MAIN ACCOUNTS IS PROJECTED TO BE

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:05.155
IN A DEFICIT -- IN THIS BUDGET

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.825

AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:18.569
ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR THE STATE

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.170
TO FILL IN THE COST OF THAT GAP

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:21.505
THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE

THE DEPARTMENT'S DIFFICULTIES

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.979
LIKELY ARE -- I THINK WE KNOW

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.781
THERE RESULT OF MULTIPLE FACTORS

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:32.983
THOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY A MAJOR

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.685
FACTORS THE SHORTAGE OF FUNDING

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.120
FROM BOTH.

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.421
OF THESE TWO ACCOUNTS.

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.890

PROBLEMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.559

THE DEPARTMENT IS LONG FACED A

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.729

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.401

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:51.835
POR ENFORCEMENT DELAYED SITE

00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:54.705
REMEDIATION AND AT TIMES OF

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:58.909
FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC

00:42:58.976 --> 00:42:59.643
CONCERNS.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.945
NUMEROUS INTERNAL EFFORTS TO

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:01.812
IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.280
TNC UNDER SEVERAL DIRECTORS HAS

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:05.749
NOT RESULTED AND SIGNIFICANT

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:07.718
CHANGE IN MANY RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.653
OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.690
HAVE STILL NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.358
EVEN ADEQUATE FUNDING.

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:15.893
I IS NOT.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.828
A THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WILL

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:20.431
IMPROVE DTS SEES DECISION MAKING

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:21.966
OR MAKE THEIR DECISIONS MORE

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.133

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.235

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.008
SUITE OF CHANGES TO THE

DEPARTMENT THAT IS AIMED AT

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.745

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.113

THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:44.288
AND THIS REALLY CANNOT WAIT ANY

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.657
LONGER -- ARE THERE ANY

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.492
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:50.260
MR FONG FOLLOWED BY OTHERS REST.

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.495

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.699
OF THE RESTRUCTURING.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.434
CONCEPTS ARE IDEAS THAT ARE

00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.136
BEING DISCUSSED IF YOU COULD

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:00.471

THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES.

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:11.749
THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE AGENCY.

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:12.983
I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT WE'RE

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.985
STILL IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.286

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.723
STRUCTURE BUT IT WOULD IT WOULD.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.557
INCLUDE SOME OF THE

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:21.825
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

MIDDLE OF CONDUCTING A WORKLOAD

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.443
ANALYSIS -- THAT WORKLOAD

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.011
ANALYSIS IS GOING TO ASSIST US

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.080
WITH IDENTIFYING GAPS IN WHERE

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:45.182
WERE ABLE TO MEET YOUR STATUTORY

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.550
MANDATES AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT IN

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.886

BE TIED TO THE THE RESULTS OF

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.190
THAT ANALYSIS.

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:54.191
SO ARE THERE SOME THINGS THAT

PROCESS OF BEING MOVED MOVING

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:11.775
ALONG TO TO TO RESTRUCTURE.

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.744
IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE THE

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:14.745
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:16.180
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL I WOULD

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:17.915
SAY THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.316
CONSIDERING ALL THOSE THE

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.684
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE PAL HAS

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:23.320
MADE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.189
FOR US TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.391
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR WORKLOAD

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:30.761
AND WHAT RESOURCES WE ARE A SIGN.

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:33.363
OR OR THE RESOURCES THAT WERE

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.099
USING FOR SPECIFIC STATUTORY

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:38.702
MANDATES TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:41.338
RESOURCE -- REQUIREMENTS WOULD

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.907
BE TIED TO THOSE RESTRUCTURED.

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.509
THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.211
RESTRUCTURE THAT THE INDEPENDENT

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:49.179
REVIEW PANEL MADE AND SO --

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:49.947
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:51.982
CONDUCTING THAT ANALYSIS AND

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:55.786
WERE ON SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:57.454
THAT ANALYSIS BY THE FALL.

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.022
I GUESS MY CONCERN IS MAYBE THE

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.090
LA -- CAN CHIME IN HERE TOO IS

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:01.425
THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:03.327
A ONE TIME.

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.428
A LITTLE THE WHAT THAT WHAT'S

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:05.062
GOING TO HAPPEN IS IS THERE'S

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.663
GONNA BE A ONE TIME BACK FILL

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.232
BUT THEN.

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.900
I MEAN IT'S IS THAT POPULATE THE

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:10.767
THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK NEXT

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.302
YEAR OR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.904
ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:15.539
BACK FILL SOMETHING.

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.074
IF SOMETHING'S NOT HAPPENING OR

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.342
WHAT WERE THERE'S NOT A OF THE

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:20.344
PROCES MOVING FORWARD TO

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.513
ACTUALLY GET -- DGSE OF FROM

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.915
UNDER THE THE THE THE SITUATION

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:26.717
BEING INSOLVENT -- I GUESS

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.218
THAT'S THE LIE LARGER CONCERN

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.219
THAT I SHARE WITH THE CHAIRMAN

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:29.520
IS.

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:30.554
IS.

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.623
IS THERE REALLY A PLAN TO GET

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:35.993
OUT OF INSOLVENCY NEXT YEAR AND

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:36.960
THE YEAR FOLLOWING.

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:39.696
IT SHOULD SHOULD WE IDENTIFY THE

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.131
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES REQUIRED

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:44.168
THAT AND KNOW WHAT FEE STRUCTURE

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.170
WOULD BE REQUIRED.

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:48.472
TO TO CREATE ADEQUATE REVENUE.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:49.506
THERE WILL BE A TIME.

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.941
IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET THOSE

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.943
FEES IN PLACE TO TALK TO OUR

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.411
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHATEVER FREE

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:56.113
FOR PROPOSALS WE PUT FORTH.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.348
AND THEN OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY TO

00:46:58.415 --> 00:46:59.583
TO BRING THAT -- ANY FEE

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.951
PROPOSALS BEFORE THE

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.352
LEGISLATURE'S SO IT IS.

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:03.520
HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:05.155
SEE REVENUE FROM A NEW FREE

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.024
STRUCTURE.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.760
IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.794
MAYBE THE LA -- CONVENE CHIME IN

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:13.063
IN TERMS OF SURE OF THAT.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.632
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT THE

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.000
RECOMMENDATION THE AGENDA THEY

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.068
RATED DOT TO PLACE HOLDER

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.671
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO CREATE

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.806
A FEW TASK FORCE WHICH IS

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.008
INTENDED I BELIEVE TO ADDRESS

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.310
ISSUES REGARDING THE FEE AND

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:28.111
ESTABLISH A FEE STRUCTURE THAT

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.980
WILL SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS IN

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.615
THE LONG TERM IT'S A HAZARDOUS

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.516
WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT.

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.251
THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.319
ACCOUNT HOWEVER.

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:36.220
THAT I THINK THERE'S A

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.688
REALIZATION AND IT'S GONNA TAKE

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:40.123
OF THAT WORKING GROUP AWHILE TO

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.092
COME TO A CONSENSUS.

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:44.261
AND THEN ADOPT THE WHATEVER FEES

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.964
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO AGREE UPON --

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.865
SO THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.200
IN FUTURE YEARS THERE WILL BE

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.903
ADDITIONAL NEEDS TO BACK FILL.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.672
ON THESE FUNDS IN ORDER TO FOR

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.441
THEM TO MAINTAIN SALT.

00:47:57.507 --> 00:48:00.944
AND TO TO FINITARY MAIN SOLVENT --

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:07.484
AND THEN IT REGARDING THE

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.385
THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.987
HERE RESTRUCTURING DGSE TO

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:10.621
IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:11.154
ACCOUNTABILITY IN DECISION

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.289
MAKING I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:12.923
ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.224
WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.125
ENTAIL.

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:16.927
AN HOUR BUT WITH ALL THE SIX IT

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:18.061
ALSO LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'LL BE

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.329
DOING A CONNECTING TO STEADY

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:21.098
POTENTIALLY ON HOW TO

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.233
RESTRUCTURE THE SAFETY CONSUMER

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.701
PRODUCTS PROMINENT WILL GRAMS

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:26.003
THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOUSED.

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.371
IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:28.739
HOPEFULLY CHIEF IDENTIFY SOME

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:30.540
EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:32.209
ACHIEVED THERE.

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.577
SO THE OF I'M AND READING

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:36.179
BETWEEN THE LINES -- YOUR

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:41.251
ANALYSIS PROBABLY INDICATES THAT --

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.053
THE THE INSOLVENCY PART AND THE

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.821
STRUCTURAL CHANGES WILL.

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.223
THE WON'T FIT BE IT WILL BE

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.890
DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION NEXT

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:47.858
YEAR.

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.259
AND THE YEAR AFTER PROBABLY MOST

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.827
LIKELY.

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.662
I THINK THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.664
THAT THAT WILL THAT WILL HAPPEN

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.566
YES AND THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.835
NEED. TO TO PROVIDE SOME GENERAL

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:02.072
FUND TO BACK FILL THESE TWO

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.640
FUNDS IN THE FUTURE.

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.442
IS THERE ANY TALK OF A MAYBE

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:07.344
THAT IS THERE ANY TALK OF OF OF

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.046
NOT AB OF TRYING TO FIX THESE

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.082
CHALLENGES -- TO NOT HAVE TO DO

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.417
THIS NEXT YEAR I MEAN IS IT

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.719
POSSIBLE TO GET THIS FUND

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:18.422
SOLVENT BETWEEN. TO NOW NEXT

00:49:18.488 --> 00:49:19.956
YEAR OR AND ARE NOW JUST A

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:21.391
POSSIBLE.

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.192
I THINK WITH THE TIMING AND THE

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.026
AND THE BUT THE MAY REVISION

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.594
PROPOSAL ENVISIONED WAS KIND OF

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.163
THE THREE YEARS RIGHT THAT IT

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.598
WOULD BE -- THAT FUNDING IN

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:29.266
NINETEEN TWENTY AND DURING THAT

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:30.667
THE SUBSEQUENT TWO YEARS WHICH

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:31.568
IS WHAT THAT MAY REVISION

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.370
PROPOSED IT WOULD THERE WOULD BE

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:35.072
TIME AND NEEDED TO PUT.

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.239
A NEW FEE SCHEDULE PLACE

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.441
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:38.875
ABOUT BOTH OF THE FUNDS I THINK

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.010
THAT'S KIND OF WAS THE

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:41.611
RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS KIND OF

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:46.350
A LONGER -- A LONGER TIME LINE.

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.919
TO TO PUT FORWARD.

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:49.219
THANK YOU.

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:50.420
MISTER YEAH UNFORTUNATELY I

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.388
THINK THERE'S A TIME LINE OF

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.522
OFFER GETTING ANY KIND OF FEE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.191
RESTRUCTURING DONE THAT'S PART

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.826
OF THE PROBLEM HERE IT'S SO

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:58.128
WE'RE NOW -- A ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.430
MONTHS -- POST THE INDEPENDENT

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:02.833
REVIEW PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:05.202
AND WE'RE SITTING HERE LOOKING

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:07.838
AT A A DEFICIT -- MOVING FORWARD

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.306
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.441
OTHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT --

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:14.144
WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT --

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:17.914
OF VERY SHORT TO OF GOD THE NEXT

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.750
FEW DAYS -- WILL PROVIDE

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:21.118
LANGUAGE SHOP FOR IMPROVING

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:23.653
TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.389
AND DECISION MAKING.

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:27.057
ON THOSE THINGS HOWEVER GOING TO

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:28.725
BE IF THEY'RE ADOPTED IN THE

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:29.192
BUDGET ARE GOING TO BE

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.995
IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEAR TERM

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:32.796
THANK IN A WAIT.

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:37.834

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- GOING

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.241

YOU STEPPED UP AND BEEN

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.943
INCREASED IN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:47.878
IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT.

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.012
SO IN TWENTY YEARS THERE'S BEEN

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:51.948
NO EFFORT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.284
HOW TO PUT TOGETHER FREE HE

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.753
STRUCTURE THAT IS GOING TO HELP

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.989
THE DEPARTMENT GET OUT FROM

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:00.357
UNDER ALL OF THIS HAS THEIR?

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.425
WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A FAIR

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:03.193
AMOUNT OF ANALYSIS I THINK ONE

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.828
OF THE CHALLENGES FOR US IS TO

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.496
MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALIGNED WITH

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.564
THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.199
ADMINISTRATION ON THE LEVEL OF

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:10.867
SERVICE IT'S BEEN ALL THAT NEEDS

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:11.735
TO BE OFFERED.

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.170
NO OVER THE COURSE OF THAT

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.571
TWENTY YEARS THERE'S BEEN A

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:15.705
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.107
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR THE

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:18.475
DEPARTMENT.

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.143
AND THAT HASN'T BEEN ALIGNED

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.845
WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO WE

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.547
HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.781
WHEN WE COME UP WITH THE FLICK

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:25.849
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.217
AND CLEARLY WE HAD AN

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.152
INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND WE'VE

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:32.155
ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS ALL

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:35.225
OF OUR DEEP DEEP CONCERN WITH

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.561
THE DEPARTMENT IN ALL OF THE THE

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.062
FAILING SO YOU YOU YOU ARE THE

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.597
ACTIVE DIRECTORY YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:43.166
COMING IN. TO A SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.902
THE DIRECTOR TALKED ABOUT -- WHO

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:48.305
WAS THE GENTLEMAN WHO WHO SPOKE

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:50.540
THE SECTOR?

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:51.875
SECRETARY BLUNT.

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:52.776
AND HE ASSURED US THAT WE WOULD

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:56.313
BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:56.947
WHAT ONE OF THE COMMENTERS MADE

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:58.415
IS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.850
PUTTING TOGETHER A CLEAR

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.251
UNDERSTANDING?

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:03.053
OF YOUR WORK LOAD.

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.121
HOW'S THE LEGISLATURE GIVES

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:07.290
ADDITIONAL WORK -- PASSES

00:52:07.357 --> 00:52:09.259
LEGISLATION.

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.460
THAT'S INCREASING YOUR WORKLOAD

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.062
AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY HAS TO

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:14.898
SAY WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.800
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT IF

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.835
NOBODY IS REVIEWING OR IT SEEMS

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:21.505
THAT NOBODY IS REVIEWING.

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:23.573
WHO IS IT THAT LOOKS TO SEE WHAT

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.575
THE WORK LOAD IS WHETHER YOU CAN

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.943
DO IT WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD IT

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.212
RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL?

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:30.280
YOU'RE.

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:32.883
IN THE RED AND WE HAVE SO MANY

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.985
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:39.689
WHO REFUSE THIS. FOR ANY FOR ANY

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:40.857
LEGISLATION THAT GOES THROUGH WE

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.526
DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.094
THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THE

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.595
DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES.

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.097
AND AFTERNOON THAT I'M SORRY

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.666
AFTER AN ANALYSIS IS DONE.

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:51.301
I ASSUME THERE'S A CONCLUSION

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:53.069
THAT'S REACHED AND WITH THE

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:54.738
CONCLUSION IS REACHED WHY DO WE

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:57.207
WAIT TWENTY YEARS BEFORE WE'RE

00:52:57.274 --> 00:53:00.744
EVEN TALKING OR PUTTING TOGETHER.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.679
A FEE INCREASE.

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:05.215
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY AND IT

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:07.284
EVERY YEAR IT'S A REQUEST FOR

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.486
ADDITIONAL MONEY TO BACK FILL

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:11.588
AND ONCE AGAIN THERE'S AN

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.056
ADDITIONAL REQUEST.

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:14.858
I I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE LA --

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.893
ABOUT DOING THIS FOR JUST A

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.461
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAN

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:19.996
PUTTING TOGETHER THE FEE TASK

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.097
FORCE.

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:21.831
BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:23.233
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IF

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.768
SOMEBODY IS REVIEWING THIS

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:26.770
INTERNALLY THEY WOULD BE LOOKING

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:27.737
TO SEE.

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:30.140
WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE AND WHY

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:32.776
IT IS THAT WE CAN'T?

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.711
BE IN THE BLACK IN THIS WHY IS

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:36.680
IT THAT WE ARE ALWAYS IN IT IN A

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.348
DEFICIT AND TO CONTINUE TO GROW

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.016
IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.284
HAPPENED THIS YEAR.

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:44.754
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:45.522
CLEARLY THE LACK OF

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.691
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:49.125
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.727
SOMETHING BUT I JUST I CAN'T

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:52.128
IMAGINE THAT THE WE'RE GOING TO

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:55.899
HAVE A HE THE MIRACULOUS FIX TO

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:56.933
THIS.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.102
THIS IS VERY DEEP VERY VERY VERY

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.737
TROUBLING THE WAY THIS IS

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:02.305
CONTINUE TO GO THERE ARE A

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.707
NUMBER OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:06.176
LAST YEAR. TO TRY TO WORK ON

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:08.745
THIS THE THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.780
BILL'S SAYING HE WOULD EXPECTED

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.515
THE DEPARTMENT TO TO WORK THEM

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:13.216
OUT.

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.684
AND HERE WE ARE STILL WITH THE

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.286
SAME PROBLEMS.

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:18.622
I AM I I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:19.589
THAT.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.391
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:25.795
PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DELAYS IN

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:27.897
PROCESSING PERMITS?

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:28.965
I AM I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.800
WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.636
IMPROVING THE THE LENGTH OF TIME

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:35.071
IT TAKES FOR PERMIT DECISIONS.

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.673
IF YOU LOOK AT NINE PERMIT

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.641
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE I

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:40.510
BELIEVE IN A FISCAL YEAR.

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.111
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE AVERAGE

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.112
TIME TO MAKE THOSE PERMIT

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.346
DECISIONS WAS TWENTY THREE

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.114
MONTHS AND THAT'S IN DIRECT

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.849
CONTRAST TO THE AVERAGE OF FOUR

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.484
YEARS THAT IT USED TO TAKE US TO

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.652
DO A PERMANENT.

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:50.353
AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DECREASE

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.788
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:52.622
DO THE PERMITS.

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.391
WE HAVE WITH THE ADEQUATE

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.558
RESOURCES WE MAPPED OUT OF

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.861
COURSE TO BEING ABLE TO MAKE 90%

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.396
OF OUR PERMIT DECISIONS WITHIN

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:00.964
TWO YEARS AND WE BELIEVE WE HAVE

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:02.666
THE PROCESS IS IN PLACE.

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.868
AND THE STAFF TRAINING -- UNDER

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.936
WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.705
YOU'LL SEE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.507
ISSUED ELEVEN PERMIT DECISIONS

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:13.176
WE THINK WILL ISSUE TWELVE

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:14.344
PERMIT THIS.

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:15.745
DECISIONS THIS YEAR ON THE WAY

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.647
TO GETTING TO SIXTEEN PERMIT

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.049
DECISIONS A YEAR.

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:21.251
AND SO WHAT WE ARE ON THE THE

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:22.752
THE RESOURCES WE'VE BEEN GIVEN

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.587
OVER THE YEARS TO ADDRESS OUR

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:26.356
PERMITTING -- ARE PERMITTING

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.590
CHALLENGES HAVE REALLY BORN A

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.325
LOT OF FRUIT IT'S NOT THAT

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.628
VISIBLE TO FOLKS BUT IN FACT WE

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:33.363
ARE MAKING MUCH MORE TIME WE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.731
PERMIT DECISIONS.

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:36.266
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE STAFF

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.634
RESOURCES.

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:39.069
YOU DO HAVE.

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:40.937
ALLOWS YOU TO BE CAPABLE OF

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.639
ADDRESSING THE CORE

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:44.507
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE SIGNED

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.509
TO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT.

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.811
AGAIN.

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:49.179
I WOULD REFER TO WHAT CHIEF

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.480
DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEGREES

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.082
MENTIONED WHICH IS THAT.

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:53.516
THERE ARE SOME GAPS AND WE KNOW

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.118
THERE'S SOME GAPS AND WE ARE

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.720
WORKING VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.788
WITH GREAT SPECIFICITY WHAT

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.757
THOSE GAPS ARE.

00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:02.559
YOU KNOW WE KNOW.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:03.660
I COULD SIT HERE AND TELL YOU A

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:04.928
COUPLE AREAS WHERE I THINK WE

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.296
MIGHT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES BUT

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.398
THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS GIVES THIS

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.632
THAT DETAILED.

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.502
NUMERIC QUANTITATE QUANTIFIED

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:14.504
ANALYSIS OF WE'RE THOSE

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:17.507
CHALLENGES LIE AND WITHOUT GOING

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:19.976
THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE WILL BE.

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:22.312
YOU KNOW MAKING GUESSES ABOUT

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:25.815
WATER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ARE.

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:27.150
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY AT ANY

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.052
TIME WOULD WANT.

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.954
SUCH AN IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT TO

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.689
BE GUESSING.

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:33.990
BUT WE CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT.

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:36.626
THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THAT

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.661
WE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN GUESSING.

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:39.929
DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THE

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:42.432
PERSONAL CAPACITY TO DO.

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:46.970
WHAT YOU BEEN ASKED TO DO?

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:48.638
THAT'S THE ONE I WOULD JUST SAY

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:51.241
THAT -- WHERE ARE WE ARE AS WE

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.675
GO THROUGH INCOMPLETE EACH

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.477
PROGRAM AND LOOK AT -- THE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:56.179
CURRENT STOPPING LEVELS THE

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.481
WORKLOAD YOU KNOW AS SIGNED TO

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:00.250
THOSE PROGRAMS WERE BEGINNING TO

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.985
SEE SOME GAPS BUT WE NEED THE

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:03.920
ENTIRE WE NEED TO COMPLETE THE

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:06.356
ENTIRE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TO SEE.

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:11.828
WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE -- WE

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.797
HAVE DEFICIENCIES IN SOME AREAS

00:57:13.863 --> 00:57:16.266
THAT COULD BE -- MANAGED BY RE

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:17.934
DIRECTION OF RESOURCES IN OTHER

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:19.869
AREAS AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:21.104
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY.

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:23.273
PRELIMINARILY THAT WE HAVE A

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.175
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DEFICIT AT

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.810
THIS POINT PURSES WHEN WE

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.078
COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS WE SHOULD

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:30.880
HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:33.082
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY OF ALL OF OUR

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.951
RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:36.519
MANDATES AND OUR STRATEGIC

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.655
PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE IN THE

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:40.390
MIDDLE OF FINALIZING RIGHT NOW.

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:42.425
SO -- I'M NOT TRYING TO PASS OFF

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.893
THE ANSWER BUT I THINK IT WOULD

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.095
BE JUST A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.831
TO SAY RIGHT NOW.

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.699
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS EXTENSIVE

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:51.801
UNDER RESOURCING IS I DO EXPECT

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:53.469
SOME PROGRAMS TO BE.

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:55.371
THERE TO BE A GAP BETWEEN HOW

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:57.207
THE RESOURCE AND WHAT THEIR

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.209
MANDATES ARE AND I'D LIKE TO

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:00.944
COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS BEFORE WE

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.812
SAY THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:06.082
RESOURCES RATHER THAN RE DIRECT.

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.116
AND YOU SAY THE YOU WILL

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.452
CONCLUDED THE ANALYSIS BY FALL

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.353
WE'RE ON TARGET FOR THAT

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:10.653
[inaudible]

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.324
AND AT DO YOU WOULD YOU AGREE

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.593
THAT IF AFTER FALL YOU COMPLETE

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.294
THIS ANALYSIS YOU PROVIDE US

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.463
YOUR RESPONSE AND IF YOU'RE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.532
STILL IN IN IF IF IT'S STILL THE

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.901
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.030
THEY WE KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.932
ASKING THE SAME CONSTANTLY.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.233
OF WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE NEED

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.368
TO DO AND AND WE TALKED ABOUT

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.435
HOW WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.904
PERMITTING PROCESS.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.672
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT INCLUDING

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.174
MORE EQUITY AND COMMUNITY BEING

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.009
PART OF THAT -- THE FEE

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.210
STRUCTURES.

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.178
AT THE END OF THE DAY AT MY

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.712
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS KEEPING

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.080
PEOPLE HEALTHY AND I HAVE A

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.282
COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:41.684
PLACE AND WITH MANY THINGS OUT

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.686
THERE MANY TOXICS OUT THERE.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.087
ON AND WORK THAT'S TRYING TO GET

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.155
DONE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:48.291
ENGAGING HAVE BEEN VERY VOCAL

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.091
ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FOR AWHILE

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.092
NOW.

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:50.893
IN SO WORRIES ME THAT WE'RE

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.795
GOING TO SPEND ANOTHER THREE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.463
YEARS COMING UP WITH THE PLAN

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.032
THAT THEN WE WILL IMPLEMENT.

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:57.567
VERSUS WE'VE HAD SO MUCH

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.267
INFORMATION THAT FROM A

01:03:58.334 --> 01:03:59.502
DISCUSSION THAT I THINK WE COULD

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.137
DO SOME KEY PILLARS OF THAT

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:03.573
REFORM NOW. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.341
ADDS THAT GETS MOVED IN

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.043
IMPLEMENTED MAYBE IF I TAKE A

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.277
YEAR MOVIES I TAKE TWO YEARS BUT

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.745
IF WE WAIT TO ADOPT THAT THAT'S

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:10.813
GOING TO TAKE THOSE YEARS PLUS

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.515
WHATEVER IT IS TO IMPLEMENT THAT.

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:13.616
IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.984
COMMUNITIES I CONTINUE TO BE

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.452
PLACED IN THE CONTINUE TO BE

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.787
SICK OUT THERE.

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:18.854
I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:22.425
INFORMATION OUT THERE TO BE ABLE --

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.493
TO PASSING REFORMS NOW I TO

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.263
ESTABLISH SCHOOLS AROUND EQUITY

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.298
AROUND FEE STRUCTURES -- AROUND

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:30.967
PERMITTING AROUND MAKING SURE

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.268
NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE PERMITTING

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.003
BUT WE'RE RETURNING TO THE SITE

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:34.870
TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.105
ACTUALLY BEING FOLLOWED OR MAYBE

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.907
THERE'S IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ROAD

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.275
THAT WE CAN NOW IMPLEMENT.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.177
ALONG THE WAY AND SO I THINK WE

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.979
HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THIS

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:43.980
POINT WE HAD ENOUGH THE

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.581
DISCUSSIONS.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.583
I UNDERSTAND THERE YOUR HAVE A

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.385
MINUTE LONG I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.286
ARE GOVERNOR HASN'T BEEN THERE

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:51.721
THAT LONG BUT I FEEL LIKE.

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:52.822
THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH OF A

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.790
REASON NOT TO TAKE ACTION THIS

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.859
YEAR ON AND NOT TO START TO MOVE

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.528
THINGS FORWARD I THINK HAVING A

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:00.162
BUDGET.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.130
BACK FILL FOR ONE YEAR AND THE

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.231
REALITIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.267
HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN ALLOWS US

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.468
TO COME BACK AND SAY WHAT HAVE

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:07.536
WE DONE THIS YEAR FOR REALS AND

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.405
WHAT THE NEXT THE BERGEN TO TAKE.

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:10.239
I SAID A THING LET'S HAVE

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:10.840
EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT BECAUSE

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.375
NO MATTER WHAT TIME WE COME UP

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.643
WITH FOR HUMAN BEINGS IS NOT

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.977
GOING TO BE A PERFECT PLAN.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.445
BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:23.586
THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:23.819
HEALTH.

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:25.488
ENTER THE COMMUNITIES AND TERMS

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.522
OF GENERATIONS OF KIDS THAT WE

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.024
CONTINUE TO MAKE SIX GENERATIONS

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:28.658
THAT MAYBE WE COULD STOP SOONER.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.359
OUT THERE AND SO FOR ME I I A

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.894
SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION --

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:32.962
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TRAILER

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.431
BILL OUT THERE -- AND I HOPE

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.799
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.367

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.036
OF TOXINS IN THE GOVERNOR AND

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.404
THE LEGISLATURE COULD COME UP

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.005
WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THIS YEAR TO

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.473
MOVE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD TO AND

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.341
NOT WAIT.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.009
ANY FURTHER AND I HOPE THAT WE

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.412
ARE TAKING THE LESSONS LEARNED I

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:52.515
APPRECIATE THE STEPPING BACK ON

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.717
THE LOAN FROM THE DEBATE THE

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.651
BATTERY FEET TO HELP.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.888
A PIECE OF BACK I APPRECIATE --

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.356
THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING THE WORK

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.190
WE'VE DONE I THINK IN THE

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.291
DISCUSSION WE COULD EVEN TALK

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.060
ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED AND

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.494
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOANS.

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:06.495
AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHOULD

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.097
BE ALONE I SHOULD BE A GIFT AT

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.466
SOME POINT ON AND AND MOVE

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:11.667
FORWARD SOMETHING THAT.

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.302
IS THE LEAST WE COULD DO FOR FOR

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.537
THESE COMMUNITY SO WE'RE NOT

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.974
POSITIVES THIS FORD BUT I WILL

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.543
SAY HAVING BEEN HERE NOW

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.713
THIRTY YEARS I DON'T SEE WHY.

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.014
WE NEED TO WAIT TILL FALL I

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.615
DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T DO

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:27.917

ON THE CHASSIS AND THE NEED FOR

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.527
REFORM I JUST WANTED TO START

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.697
WITH A FEW PRINCIPLES -- ONE IS

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.600
THAT ANY PROGRAMMATIC REDUCTIONS

TO BE PAYING. FOR THE COST OF

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.598
THIS AGENCY RATHER THAN MEMBERS

ON THERE FOR A WHILE WE

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:01.770
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MIGHT BE A

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.139
STOP GAP -- MEASURE FOR THIS

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:07.676
YEAR -- IT MUST NOT BE A BLANK

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:08.277
CHECK.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.613
WE NEED -- CONDITIONS WE NEED

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.249
BENCHMARKS ON FROM THE

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:15.985
LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.053
IS A REAL IMPROVEMENT ATTACHED

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:18.654
TO THIS.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:22.725
BLANK CHECK THAT IS BEING ASKED.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.594
FOR THIS YEAR -- WE REALLY NEED

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:26.695
THIS AGENCY TO BE MORE

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:28.531
TRANSPARENT MORE COUNTABLE AND

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:30.332
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:30.866
COMMUNITY'S WE'VE BEEN.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.068
OF PARROTING THIS PHRASE A LOT

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.870
OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IT REALLY

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:35.871
MEANS SOMETHING.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.540
ON WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:38.941
GOVERNING BOARD OR OR OVERSIGHT

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.175
BOARD IN THE ABSENCE OF THE

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:42.278
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.046
COMMUNITIES HAVE NOWHERE TO GO --

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:44.947
TO FOR THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.383
OTHER THAN THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:48.317
FRANKLY THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:48.617
[inaudible]

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:49.985
ARM.

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.954
IN TERMS OF A AS WE TALKED ABOUT

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:56.592
FUNDING GAPS I DO WANT TO ALERT --

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.894
AT THE MEMBERS HERE ARE THAT

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:02.197
ALREADY THIS PRO THIS DEPARTMENT

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.899
HAS NOT FULFILLED SOME BASIC

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.968
THINGS IN TWENTY TWELVE THE

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.336
POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM AT

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:09.104
THE TNC GOT CUT BECAUSE OF LACK

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.039
OF FUNDING.

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.473
SO AS WE START LOOKING AT BIG

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.275
PICTURE REFORMS WE NEED TO LOOK

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.177
AT THE BIGGER PICTURE IN TERMS

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.079
OF WHAT IS IN OUR FUTURE IF WE

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.547
DON'T START REDUCING THE AMOUNT

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.615
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:21.917
THAT WE CREATE -- WE'RE GOING TO

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.085
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE TYPES OF

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.987
DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD LIKE THE

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.455
POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM TO

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:28.390
BE REFUNDED INCLUDED IN IN IN

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.459
THE FEE STRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.127
THAT STEM FROM THIS.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.029
ARM THE STATE WHAT HAZARDOUS

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:35.497
WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THE

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.433
LEGISLATURE ORDER THAT DONE IN

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:38.500
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.268
NINETEEN NINETIES IT WAS NEVER

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:40.402
DONE.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.605
AS A STATE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:43.472
WE'RE GOING WE DON'T KNOW HOW

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.007
MUCH WASTE IS BEING GENERATED

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.475
AND WHERE AND WHERE IT'S GOING

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.077
TO BE CITED AND LOCATED.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:49.511
SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:50.412
NEED TO THINK ABOUT AS WE THINK

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:53.349
ABOUT THESE LONGER TERM

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.183
SOLUTIONS.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.186
AND FINALLY WERE -- FIFTY FOUR

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:57.753
BACK FILLING AND FILLING THE

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.754
HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.322
BUT IT WE NEED TO ALSO PAY

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.958
ATTENTION TO THE TOSCA ACCOUNT.

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:04.193
ON I THINK THE STAFF REPORTS

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:05.427
HAVE NOTED FOR THE LAST COUPLE

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.096
YEARS THAT THE DEFICIT IS

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.797
IMPENDING -- I WOULD SAY THAT

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:09.798
THE DECEPTIVE BECAUSE IT IS

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:11.934
ALREADY HERE. FOR THE LAST

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.269
COUPLE OF YEARS -- DTS CD HAS

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.771
ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND ABOUT

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.540
HALF OF THE ORPHAN SITE CLEANUPS

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.342
IN CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS THAT

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.276
OTHER HALF.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.778
OF THAT CONTAMINATION IS

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:25.414
SPREADING AND IS GOING TO COST

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.416
THE TAXPAYERS AND THE STATE MORE

BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS FOR

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.679
A FEW YEARS ACTUALLY TO TO

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.180
UPDATE IT ACTUALLY -- SEVERAL

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.882
YEARS AGO IT WAS ANTICIPATED

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.750
THAT THE NEW THIS CAL SYSTEM

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:18.553
WOULD INCLUDE FUNCTIONALITY --

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.656

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.999
WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SCALP

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:32.534
COULDN'T -- INCLUDE THIS

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.302

THE SYSTEM SO -- I THINK WE'RE

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.714
SEEING SOME DELAYS BECAUSE WE

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.918
ANTICIPATED FISCALE WOULD BE

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:50.385
ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE
