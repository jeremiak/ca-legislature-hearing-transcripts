TODAY MISTER- MAIENSCHEIN IS GONNA BE PRESENTING- AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR. AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES AS WELL AS YOU MENTIONED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO CONTAIN SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE COSTS THIS COMMITTEE PASSED THIS BILL LAST YEAR IS AB TWELVE FORTY NINE. THE BILL WAS UNFORTUNATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE LANGUAGE IN AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR REFLECTS CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT. EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN COSTS AND OBTAIN THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE TWO PILOTS ONE IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE AND THE OTHER IN THE NORTHERN SECTION THAT WOULD OPERATE FOR A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS. THE PILOTS WOULD INCLUDE RISK BEARING PROVIDERS THAT ARE MONITORED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY AND OPERATIONS. SELF FUNDED EMPLOYER PLANS WOULD USE RISK BASED OR CAPITATED PAYMENT MECHANISMS WITH THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR THEIR SERVICES RATHER THAN PURE FEE FOR SERVICE COMPENSATION. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES OF THE TWO PILOTS. TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE ON PROMISING MODELS OF HEALTHCARE FINANCING AND DELIVERY A STUDY BY THE UC. SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PREDICTED THAT THIS TYPE OF MODEL COULD REDUCE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES BY AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. COMBATING THE RISING COSTS OF HEALTH CARE REQUIRES A NEW WAY OF THINKING THE PILOT. PROJECTS AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE APPROACH HEALTHCARE DELIVERY.
