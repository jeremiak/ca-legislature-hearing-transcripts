EVERYBODY- HOWEVER I HAVE A

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:49.480
SEVERAL CONCERN. OF PRIME

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:52.283
AROUND OF THE DUKE. OF THESE

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.619

EVIDENCE THAT THEY'LL JUST GET

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.459
CAUGHT UP IN THE- IN THE

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:04.262
WHIRLWIND OF IT ALL- AT THE E.

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:08.232
D. D. HEARING THAT WE HAD A

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.267
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. MONTHS

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.435
AGO I THINK IT. IT WAS MADE

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:14.939
VERY CLEAR THAT THE FRAUD CASES

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.208
I KNOW IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:20.878
THAT- EDT PAID BILLIONS THIRTY

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.113
ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:24.348
FRAUDULENT KAMES AT CLAIMS.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:26.450
THAT MONEY WENT TO INMATES WHO

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:27.852
ARE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:30.288
BENEFITS WHAT WAS VERY CLEAR

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:33.724
FROM THE HEARING IS THAT 9295%

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.395
OF THE FRAUD CASES WERE NOT

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:40.831
ATTRIBUTED TO. ANYONE WHO HAD

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:41.699
BEEN INCARCERATED DURING THAT

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:45.336
TIME SO OVER TRUE BEAUTY IN THE

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:49.340
PERCENTAGE OF FRAUD CASES. ARE

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:52.710
SO DRAMATICALLY I THINK IS AN

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.811
INCORRECT THING TO PUT FORWARD

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.513
CONSIDERING THAT WHAT WE REALLY

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.281
WANT IS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:59.383
ANYONE WHO BROKE THE LAW

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.152
ANYBODY WHO FILED A FRAUDULENT

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:04.055
CAME ON A CLAIM. SO I'M

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.190
CONCERNED THAT THAT BECOMES THE

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:09.126
DRIVING FORCE HERE THAT- YOU

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:13.164
KNOW WOULD LEAD US TO DENY

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.334
LEGITIMATE BY ANYONE WHO WAS

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.236
EITHER INCARCERATED- AT THE

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:22.607
TOP- AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:23.774
A RELEASE FROM CARS SERRATION

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.676
OR MAYBE NOT EVEN EVER HAVING

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.578
BEEN INCARCERATED- I DON'T

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.313
THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:36.554
APPROACH TO TAKE ON THIS. SO I-

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:37.588
I WOULD- I THINK THAT THERE'S

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:39.423
TO BE DONE FOR TWO THE DUE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.225
PROCESS OF A CLAIM IN REGARD OF

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:45.296
WHO CLAIM IS- THAT. WE MAKE.

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:46.797
THAT WE'RE NOT THE NINE THAT

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:49.634
WHEN I TURN AROUND AND DO YOU

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.635
NINE- PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:55.239
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS SO I- I

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:59.710
WOULD- VERY NARROW SOME. ON THE

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:02.380
BILL IF- IF THERE WERE IS

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:03.314
ASSURANCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.483
CONTINUE TO ADD DUE PROCESS

TO THE OTHER PIECES SO IF

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.433
THERE'S ANY WAY THAT WE COULD.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.103
I COULD GET THAT PROVIDED ALL

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.337
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR TODAY

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:12.140
I WOULD. I WOULD SUPPORT BUT-

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:16.311
I'M HOLDING ON TO SEE EXACTLY

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:16.878
WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE IN FOR

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:20.048
HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO.

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.650
DRAWS ARE THERE ARE MANY DEALS

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.985
AND MANY IDEAS WELL NOT AS MANY

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.820
AS I EXPECTED THERE MIGHT BE

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.389
BECAUSE OF THE ANGER OF OUR

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:29.591
CONSTITUENTS THE BUT THAT SAID.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:30.959
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOR THAT'S

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.260
OUR JOB THAT'S WHAT THE

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.529
LEGISLATURE DOES WE NEED AND WE

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:37.732
CONSIDER. FIVE SET TO THE LONG

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.301
EIGHTY HEARINGS AS WELL. AND

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.636
HEARD MANY IDEAS. ALL OF WHICH

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:44.105
I LISTEN TO NONE OF US ARE NOT

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:45.373
SOME OF WHICH I TOOK VERY

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.409
SERIOUSLY OTHERS I DID NOT. BUT

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.077
THAT'S OUR JOB AND THERE'S THE

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:51.680
BILL'S PROGRESS BILLS PLURAL.

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.548
THEN LEAVE THEM TO COLLECTIVELY

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:54.683
THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:57.252
COMMITTEE STRUCTURES. THERE ARE

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:59.754
LEADERSHIP NEGOTIATIONS WORKING

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.423
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN SOME

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:04.125
CASES. WE WILL THEN AS WE

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:05.460
USUALLY DO COME UP WITH THE

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:09.431
FINAL SOLUTION. I EXPECT TO BE

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:09.998
MORE THAN ONE BILL. BUT I DO

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:11.499
NOT EXPECT ANYTHING WE DO. THIS

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:15.904
YEAR. MAY BE ENOUGH. THIS IS

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.806
TAKEN DECADES TO GET THIS

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:20.041
TANGLED UP AS IT HAS BEEN. BUT

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.978
MY POINT IS WE MUST ACT WE

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.247
OUGHT TO THE CITIZENS OF

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:28.783
CALIFORNIA ACT. EXPEDITIOUSLY

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:29.384
AND THAT WOULD MEAN BY THE END

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:33.221
OF THE SESSION. YOU SENATOR-

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:36.358
CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU TOM.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:40.462
LET ME OFFER. A LITTLE LIGHT

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:45.267
OF. THE B. BECAUSE- I'M ON J.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.302
LACK IN THE VICE CHAIR WE HAD A

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:50.705
HERE THERE WAS AN AUDIT. A AND-

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:52.674
THERE WERE AS I RECALL TWO

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.110
MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.245
I DON'T THINK THIS BILL HAS THE

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.080
RECESSION PLANNING BECAUSE I'M

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.683
DOING THAT BILL IT IS A

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.385
BIPARTISAN BILL AND IT

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:06.254
BASICALLY SAYS WITH THE

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.689
RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME FROM

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.391
THE AUDITOR THAT WE WOULD PUT

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.760
THAT IN THE STATUTE. BECAUSE

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:14.663
THERE WAS THE GREAT RECESSION

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.965
AND A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.833
TEN YEARS AGO WITH THE D. D.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.535
THERE WAS AN AUDIT REPORT THAT

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.937
WAS VERY SIMILAR IT WAS NOT

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:27.676
IMPLEMENTED IT- THE MELTDOWN

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:28.977
NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATION CAME

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.845
UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN IT WASNOT

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:36.151
IMPLEMENTED THEN THIS HAPPENED.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:36.918
UNDER GOVERNOR KNOWS SOME. AND

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.653
WE DON'T TO FACE ANOTHER.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.588
WITHOUT THERE EVER BEING A PLAN

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:43.725
THAT IS IN PLACE BEFORE HAND TO

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.394
SCALE UP WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.295
WE DON'T HAVE WHAT HAPPENED

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:50.965
HERE. BUT HAVEN'T I WAS NOT

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:52.701
CONSIDERING THAT THERE MIGHT BE

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.869
THINGS IN THE STRIKE TEAM. ARE

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.871
THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:59.040
ADDITION TO THE AUDIT THAT

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.442
WOULD BE AN BILLS BECAUSE I

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.776
THINK. THE TWO MAJOR

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:02.844
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.546
INCORPORATED BETWEEN THIS BILL

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.381
AND THE BILL ON TO WHEN.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.416
THERE'S A STRIKE TEAM AND THE

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.085
PLACE THAT THERE RE A TON OF

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.820
BILLS ARE COMING OUT OF THE

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.855
ASSEMBLY. BUT THEY HAVE DONE A

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.890
COMPLETE PACKAGE AND THEY

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:18.159
WEREN'T NECESSARILY THINGS THAT

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:20.161
WERE INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT TO

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.830
OUR- PEOPLE DID THEIR OWN

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.765
THINGS AND SO I THINK. TO BE

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.568
RESPONSIVE TO SENATOR DORADO

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:29.070
WHICH IS THE RIGHT QUESTION. IS

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.672
IF THERE MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.507
IN THE STRIKE TEAM AND THEIR

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.609
STUFF MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS OUT

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:35.944
OF THE AUDIT THEY OUGHT TO BE

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.579
ABLE TO BE EASILY CROSS

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:39.814
REFERENCED WITH THE BILLS. TO

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.316
FIND OUT WHAT'S INCLUDED AND

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:42.684
WHAT'S MISSING I JUST KNOW THE

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:43.651
MAJOR ONES THAT WERE IN THE

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.254
AUDIT OR IN BILLS THAT ARE

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:48.022
MOVING I DON'T KNOW. ABOUT THE

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:50.358
STATUS OF THE- CONSTRUCTING

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.794
RECOMMENDATIONS AND I KNOW THAT

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.063
SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY BILLS

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.097
AREN'T THINGS THAT WEREN'T IN

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:57.766
EITHER OF THE OTHER DAY ARE

01:23:57.832 --> 01:24:00.068
REALLY TRYING TO STRIKE OUT.

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:02.470
AND DEAL WITH THAT SO I THINK.

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:03.605
THE FAIR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.173
GET AN OVERALL LOOKS OF THAT WE

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.941
DON'T HAVE A BILL COME BY AND

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.676
WE TAKE ACTION PIECEMEAL WHICH

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.378
I THINK IS YOUR POINT AND IT IS

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.547
THE RIGHT POINT. AND IT'S

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:13.314
UNPREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:16.184
BILL. ARE BECAUSE OF WHAT IT

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:18.453
DOES IN RELATION THE AUDIT AND

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.888
I HAVE STRONG BIPARTISAN

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:25.226
SUPPORT DID NOT OPPOSITION. TO

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:25.860
THE BILL THAT DOES STUFF. THE A

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:26.494
RECESSION PLAN TO I THINK THE

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:27.896
QUESTION IS AND I DON'T KNOW

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:29.397
WHO DOES IT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.533
IT'S- STAFF OF OUR COMMITTEE.

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.634
FOR PEOPLE IN GENERAL I CAN

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.402
HELP WITH THE ORDER COULD HELP

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:35.670
BUT IT JUST NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:38.239
AND MAYBE COMING OUT OF THIS WE

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:39.240
CAN MAKE SURE SO THAT BEFORE WE

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:41.743
SEE. THIS BILL AGAIN SOMEWHERE

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.178

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:46.514
FLAVOR. FOR WHAT THAT SITUATION

THE LEAD PROCESS. ONE BILL

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:06.100
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL. I

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.902
DON'T EXPECT IT TO. AND THERE

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.137
WILL BE NEGOTIATIONS AS WE

OFFERED. BY A CREDIBLE SOURCE I

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.119
DO NOT THINK YOU COULD FIND A

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.788
MORE CREDIBLE SOURCE THEN WE

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:29.324

BILL HEAVENS NO LONG WAY TO GO

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:48.309
BUT I WOULD ASK THE

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:50.144
INTELLIGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:53.081

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.168
IS GOOD AND IT MEETS A

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.837
RECOMMENDATION BUT IT IS A

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.006
REALLY FAIR QUESTION TO SEE HOW

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.974
THE WHOLE THING FITS TOGETHER.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:20.842
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:21.976

SAID TO CHAPTER OUT THINGS THAT

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:45.199
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING US.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.334

START WITH THE WHAT I MENTIONED

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.397
BEFORE WHICH IS THE BENEFITS

THEY WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY FOR

EDT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN IN

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.079
PROCESS FOR A LONG TIME- AND

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.714
WASN'T SCHEDULED TO BE

FOUR- AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.185
AGO THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM

RECOGNIZED THAT THE SYSTEM-

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:14.355
MODERNIZATION PROJECT NEEDED TO

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.324
BE PAUSED AND RESTOCKED. WE

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:17.625
AGREE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.894
WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO EDT

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.229
THAT THEY RETHINK THE PROJECT

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.563
WITH A PRIORITY ON THE

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.965
COMPONENT PARTS OF IT THAT

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.266
WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.068
CALIFORNIANS AND THE QUICKEST

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.569
AMOUNT OF TIME IN THIS BILL.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.871
IMPLEMENTS THAT RECOMMENDATION

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:32.507
BY REQUIRING EDT TO PRIORITIZE

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:35.710
THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:37.078
MODERNIZATION PROJECT. THE NEXT

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.646
MAJOR AREA OF THE BILL IS THE

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.615
CALL CENTER OPERATIONS IT ASKS

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.384
EDT TO HAVE BETTER DATA ABOUT

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.752
WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.120
ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN BE

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.489
SERVED THROUGH NON CALL CENTER-

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.058
AVENUES SO THAT THEY CAN

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:50.825
RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE THAT

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:52.694
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. TO GET

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.261
THEIR BENEFITS MORE TIMELY

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:54.362
WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT ON HOLD

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:55.997
OR AND NOT ACTUALLY EVEN GET

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.865
THROUGH TO A CALL CENTER AGENT.

01:28:57.932 --> 01:28:59.867
SAID THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE EDT

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:01.135
TO UNDERTAKE THAT KIND OF

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:02.904
INFORMATION COLLECTION.

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.872
ASSESSMENT AND IN RESPONSE TO

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:07.041
THAT ASSESSMENT. IN CHANGES TO

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.143
ITS OPERATIONS TO BETTER SERVE

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.245
THOSE WERE LOOKING FOR HELP.

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:12.680
FOUR AUTHORED AT RECOMMENDING

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.649
IN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE EDT

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:15.983
TO TRACK FIRST CALL RESOLUTION

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.019
WHICH IS- MET AN INDUSTRY BEST

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:20.021
PRACTICE METRIC WHICH WOULD-

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.122
TELL EDT WHETHER IT'S

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.623
SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTING PEOPLE

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.758
THE FIRST TIME TO CALL FOR

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:25.359
ASSISTANCE. SO THAT'S AN

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.662
INDUSTRY STANDARD PRACTICE OF

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:28.796
HOW WELL YOUR CALL CENTER

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.631
OPERATES IF SOMEONE HAS TO CALL

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:31.833
YOU MORE THAN ONCE THEN THAT'S-

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:33.167
SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:34.669
HAVE TO LEARN FROM BUT RIGHT

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:35.570
NOW THEY'RE NOT TRACKING NOT AT

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.071
ALL. SO THEY NEED TO START

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.639
TRACKING AND MONITORING WHETHER

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:41.976
THEY'RE SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTING.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:42.577
CLAIMANTS WHO CALLED THE FIRST

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:43.678
TIME I CALL. THE BILL WOULD

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:45.546
REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO. THE BILL

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.115
THEN REQUIRES EDT TO DEVELOP A

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:49.183
RECESSION PLAN- IN LINE WITH

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:50.885
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACCOUNT

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.053
FOR THE LESSONS LEARNED DURING

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.521
THE PANDEMIC PERIOD BUT ALSO

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.590
PAST RECESSIONS. AS I MENTIONED

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.058
IN MY TESTIMONY EARLIER TO BE

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.626
BETTER PREPARED FOR THE

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.194
INCREASED DEMAND FOR THAT

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:01.095
TIMELY ASSISTANCE THAT PEOPLE

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:02.930
NEED. WHICH HAPPENS WHEN A

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:05.433
RECESSION OCCURS. THEY SHOULD

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.935
ALSO UPDATE THAT PLAN REGULARLY

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:08.503
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.204
REQUIRE THEM TO DO. FINAL AREA

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:11.773
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:13.307
TAKE ACTION ON IS IN THE AREA

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:14.642
FRAUD PREVENTION. AS I

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.110
MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THEY

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.278
HAD NO ASSESSMENT OF HOW

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.046
EFFECTIVELY THEY ARE PREVENTING

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.414
FRAUD WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:21.983
LOOK. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.818
COMPONENT THINGS THAT THEY DO

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:24.886
TO TRY AND PREVENT FRAUD. ARE

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:26.721
BOTH ON THEIR OWN EFFECTIVE OR

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.356
NOT. AND THAT THEY'RE WORKING

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:30.424
WELL TOGETHER OR NOT. I NEED TO

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:31.626
COMPILE THAT ASSESSMENT

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:33.394
PROVIDED TO LEGISLATURE REFRESH

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.530
ANNUALLY- REGULARLY. THAT'S

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:36.564
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.999
THEM TO DO FINALLY AS I

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:39.300
MENTIONED THEY ALSO NEED TO

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.434
CONSOLIDATE. THEIR FRAUD

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.003
PREVENTION APPROACH INTO A

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.938
SINGLE UNIT THAT'S WHAT. FRAUD

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.406
PREVENTION BEST PRACTICES

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:46.974
RECOMMEND IT'S NOT WHAT WE SAW

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.576
WHEN WE DID THE AUDIT THIS BILL

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.678
WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO ADOPT OUR

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.413
RECOMMENDATION. PERFECT THIRD

01:30:52.480 --> 01:31:12.400
JUST FOR CLARIFICATION.

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:22.310
PURPOSES THIS BILL. RECESSION

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:25.213
PLANNING AREA. AND TO BE FRIED-

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.280
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FRAUD

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:27.782
PREVENTION APPROACH THERE'S A

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.917
QUITE FOUNDATIONAL AREAS- THE

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:32.186
EDT NEEDS TO MAKE ADVANCES ON.

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:33.354
THAT COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.756
PLAN WILL ALLOW EDG TO KNOW.

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.091
THAT WHEN DEMAND STARTS TO

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.593
INCREASE FOR ITS ASSISTANCE.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:39.694
HOW IT'S GOING TO RESPOND

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.429
EFFECTIVELY SO IT DOESN'T. NEED

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.397
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN A IN

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.032
A SORT OF EMERGENCY MOMENT-

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.434
IT'LL BE PREPARED IF IT DOES

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.769
SUCH A PLAN. TO KNOW HOW'S IT

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:49.670
GOING TO QUICKLY SCALE IT STAFF

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:50.972
UP. WHAT AREAS OF ITS

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:52.540
OPERATIONS CAN TEMPORARILY

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.175
SCALED BACK AND NOT EXPERIENCE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.010
ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS. SO THOSE

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.278
ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT PLANNING

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:58.112
STEPS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.814
UNDERTAKE AND SPECIFICALLY TO

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.649
ADDRESS. WEAKNESSES THAT THEY

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:04.352
KNOW THEY HALF THAT THEY'VE

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.386
HEARD ABOUT FOR YEARS NOW. IN

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:06.520
IN THE FRAUD PREVENTION

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:08.522
EFFECTIVENESS. RIGHT NOW HE

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:09.991
DOESN'T KNOW IF IT'S USING AN

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.158
EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO PREVENT

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:13.060
FRAUD. SO IT NEEDS TO KNOW

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.929
WHETHER IT COULD BE ALLOWING US

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:16.964
WE SAW SOME FRAUDULENT CLAIMS

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.566
TO PASS THROUGH AND GET PAID-

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.468
HOW CAN IT FINE TUNE ITS TOOLS

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:21.068
TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:22.870
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.906
FINALLY. IS IT PREVENTING

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:27.174
UNDULY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS BY

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.342
CATCHING THEM IN A FRAUD

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:29.677
PREVENTION TOOL THAT'S NOT

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:30.945
ACTUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE AT

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.914
DETECTING FRAUD INSTEAD IT'S- A

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.848
SITE TRACKING LEGITIMATE

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:35.349
CLAIMANTS. TO DOING THAT

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:38.152
ANALYSIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:38.653
TWO PRETTY FOUNDATIONAL

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:39.320
COMPONENTS OF THE BILL.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:43.090
WONDERFUL S. THIS BILL HAS A

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:44.825
NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATION DATES

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:46.994
THAT ARE OVER A YEAR FROM NOW

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.563
IN YOUR VIEW. ARE THESE STATE

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:52.066
APPROPRIATE. AND WHAT WOULD BE

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:52.967
YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.635
ENSURING THAT EDT ACTUALLY

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:56.537
IMPLEMENTS THESE

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:59.840
pCERTAINLY WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.042
WHAT WE SAID WE PUT DEADLINES

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:03.210
ON OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL-

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.612
AND SOME OF THESE ARE FURTHER

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:05.980
OUT THAN THE RECOMMENDED DATES

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:07.348
THAT WE SET BUT CERTAINLY THE

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:08.849
BILLS WELL WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.051
WHAT WE SAID WHICH IS THAT

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.953
THERE SHOULD BE DATE CERTAIN-

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.220
THAT BY WHICH EDT SHOULD BE

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.022
ACCOUNTABLE FOR HAVING

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:19.493
COMPLETED THE ACTIONS. AND. AND

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.462
THE ISSUE OF ENSURING THAT EDT

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:22.830
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THESE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.032
RECOMMENDATIONS. WHAT ARE YOUR

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.034
THOUGHTS ON THAT- SO FOR THE

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.102
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE BILL

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:30.171
ADOPTS THAT WE HAVE ALSO MADE

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:32.907

LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE PROGRESS

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:38.612

DOES TAKE SOME OF THOSE

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.153
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOOD. IF

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.888
PASSED INTO LAW AS IS HE WOULD

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.090
GRADUATE THEM TO STATUTORY

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.725
REQUIREMENTS NOT JUST

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:51.792
RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE TO

STILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.338
IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHERE

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:40.840
THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUGS. GANGS

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:43.543

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:45.845
SAW OUR FRIENDS FAMILIES GOT

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:48.782
PULLED INTO IT. I JUST HAPPENED

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.350
TO BE A VERY CREATIVE CHILD.

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:53.720
VERY ARTISTIC AND THE ART

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:55.922

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:57.657
LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE AROUND A LOT

01:49:57.724 --> 01:50:00.460

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.395

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:41.232
IN MAKING OUR COMMUNITY SAFER.

02:20:41.299 --> 02:20:44.135
IN THE PROCESS. WE KNOW THAT WE

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:46.137
ARE ACTUALLY- VERY LARGE OIL

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:47.372
OIL PRODUCING STATE AS WELL AS

02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:50.275
SOME GAS AND MANY OF THESE.

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:54.045
OPERATIONS IN LARGE INDUSTRIAL

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:56.748

BUT- THE KEY IS THAT FOR ALL

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:04.189
THAT OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE

02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:05.924
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MIDSTREAM

02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:08.126
SERVICES. THE KIND OF WORK THAT

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:10.762
GOES AROUND THE WELL HEAD- WHEN

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:12.897
IT COMES TO HOW TO PLUG AND

02:21:12.964 --> 02:21:15.500
ABANDON A WELL. TO BLOCK IT UP

02:21:15.567 --> 02:21:18.136
WITH THE- CEMENT DIDN'T MAKE IT

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:20.004
GO AWAY AFTER IT'S BEEN

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.172
COLLUDING IN THE COMMUNITY FOR

02:21:21.239 --> 02:21:23.107
YEARS OR JUST TO SIMPLY-

02:21:23.174 --> 02:21:24.409
TIGHTEN UP THE SURROUNDING

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:25.476
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE

02:21:25.543 --> 02:21:28.012
THERE NO LEAKS AND THAT- PEOPLE

02:21:28.079 --> 02:21:29.714
NEARBY ARE KEPT AS SAFE AS

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.716
POSSIBLE. THE FACT IS THAT THE

02:21:31.783 --> 02:21:34.152
VAST MAJORITY OF THAT WORK HAS

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:35.954
BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST MANY

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.388
YEARS BY TURN AROUND

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:38.990
CONTRACTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:41.326
FROM OUT OF STATE. AND I THINK

02:21:41.392 --> 02:21:44.295
THAT IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:46.931

02:21:46.998 --> 02:21:48.800
TAKE CARE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:49.601
SO THAT'S WHY RUNNING THIS

02:21:49.667 --> 02:21:53.004
LEGISLATION- TO ENSURE THAT-

02:21:53.071 --> 02:21:54.739
DATE THE BEST SKILLED AND

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:56.808
TRAINED WORKERS ARE ABLE TO DO.

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.810
THE WORK- IN THE OIL AND GAS

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:00.178
SECTOR THAT THE STATE SO

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:02.046
DESPERATELY NEEDS- I THINK IT'S

02:22:02.113 --> 02:22:03.281
GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PART OF

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:04.549
THE AMERICAN JOBS PLANNED

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.583
ROLLOUT IN THE STATE OF

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:10.588
CALIFORNIA. I THINK THEY'RE.

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:11.222
REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY STIFF TO

02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:12.457
