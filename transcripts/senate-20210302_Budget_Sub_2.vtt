THAT PROPOSED USES- THERE IS

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.616
SOME QUESTION OVER THE-

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:51.817

THE FIRST AND PROBABLY MOST

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:09.735
STRAIGHT FORWARD WOULD BE TO

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.204

KNOW IT'S A FEEL GOOD OF. THAT

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.477
WERE KEEPING OUR- RESOURCES BUT

00:22:58.543 --> 00:22:59.111
WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THE

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:02.614
GROUND. WELL LAST YEAR- WEEK WE

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:03.882
GET RIGHT INTO THE HEAD WINDS

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:07.686
OF PROGRAMS AND I'M HAVING TO

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:09.821
WORK FROM HOME AND- IN THAT

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.124
REMOTE ENVIRONMENT- WEEK WE GET

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.493
BECAUSE- WITH WITH THE FACT

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.228
THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO GO BACK

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:18.630
INTO THE OFFICE- THAT WE WOULD

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:21.032
START THE PROCESS AND- WHEN WE

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.701
WHEN WE REALIZED IN THE SUMMER

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.636
THAT- GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:25.971
WASN'T GOING TO BE A REALITY

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:26.972
ANYTIME SOON WE GET STARTED

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.840
PROCESS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.108
HAD IS THAT MANY OF THESE

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.477
POSITIONS REQUIRE TRAINING AND

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.846
SO. ON THE REST OF THE BRAINY-

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.115
VIRTUALLY BECOMES- A LOT MORE

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.184
DIFFICULT NONETHELESS WE KNEW

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.185
WE HAD TO GET THE PROCESS

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.687
STARTED SO WE GET START. I'M

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:43.789
WRITING THOSE POSITIONS AND

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:47.159
POSTING THEM TOWARD THE END OF

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.660
THE YEAR. SO- YOU WERE SO TO

00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:51.129
REAP. BACK AND- OF YOUR PER-

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.999
WE'RE THAT REPORT OUT. IT'S

00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:56.434
STILL PENDING. SO IS IT SAFE TO

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:59.704
SAY THEN THAT. WE ONLY REALLY

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:00.939
HAVE THREE PEOPLE THERE AND I

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.607
UNDERSTAND CO BUT I KNOW THAT

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:04.342
TO I DO A LITTLE HOMEWORK TO

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:05.477
THIRTEEN OF THE FULL TIME STAFF

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.512
ARE CURRENTLY DIVERTED DOING

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:09.447
COVERT CONTRACT TRACING. AND

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:11.449
THEN THERE'S 80% OF YOUR OF

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.618
YOUR FULL STAFF WHICH IS ABOUT

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:14.619
THREE HUNDRED VACANCY SO THERE

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:17.923
SEEMS TO BE. SOME ISSUE HERE.

00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:19.925
AND- YOU KNOW GETTING THE FOLKS

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:21.126
TO DO GETTING THE FOR THE

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:22.427
EMPLOYEES OUT THERE TO DO THE

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:24.396
WORK THAT WE'VE- THAT THE BOOK

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.897
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS YOU

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.567
KNOW BUT- FUNDED. BY ORDERED

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.335
ACTUALLY THE OIL PRODUCERS ARE

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.170
FUNDED SO. I FIND IT QUITE

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:33.705
INTERESTING THAT WE'RE ASKING

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:34.673
FOR MORE RESOURCES WE HAVE AN

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.842
EVEN. NUMBER ONE GOT THE REPORT

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.610
BACK NUMBER TWO WE HAVEN'T HAD

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:39.845
THE VACANCIES FROM LAST YEAR

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:42.314
SO- IS IT MAKES SENSE TO ME WHY

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.849
WE WOULD CONTINUE TO JUST POUR

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:44.883
MONEY INTO A PROGRAM THAT WE

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.785
DON'T HAVE. THE FOLKS UP AND

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.119
RUNNING ON THE ON THE LAST

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.621
YEAR'S BUDGET SO FOR THOSE

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:50.989
REASONS I THINK IT'S JUST NOT

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:53.225
PRUDENT WE SHOULD WAIT. AND GET

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.960

MULTIPLE NUMBER OF REASONS AND-

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:20.312
FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE

WITH THESE CHANGES- HOWEVER WE

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.637
FIND AND WE FIND THAT THE

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:47.839

DIVISION HAS RECEIVED IN

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:15.567
RECENT. YEARS WE RECOMMEND THE

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:17.035
LEGISLATURE ADOPTS SOME

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:18.603
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.838
THAT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO

PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.674

IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.248
TO PROVIDE. SOME MORE

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:37.722
ACCOUNTABILITY ON- HOW. THE

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:38.289
DIVISION IS PERFORMING AND-

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:39.624
YEAH. ALL EGGNOG CENTER STERN

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.326
IS WITH US MORNING SAID STERN

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:43.728
CENTER TO FACT YOU SO YOU JUST

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:46.464
PROVED TO OF THE PROBLEM WE DID

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.933
REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT BACK AND

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.501
YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD ADD

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.669
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO REPORT

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:54.239
BACK AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG

00:27:54.305 --> 00:27:56.041
WITH GOVERNMENT IS THAT IF IT

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.475
DOESN'T WORK WE JUST KEEP

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.043
ADDING MORE MONEY TO IT EVEN

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.978
THOUGH WE DON'T. GET THE

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.647
PERFORMANCE. AT THE END OF THE

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.216
DAY THE LEGISLATURE. HAS FUNDED

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.851
HAS FORCED THE FUNDING ON THIS

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:09.054
PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT GIVING US

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.455
THE RESULT WE'RE ASKING FOR.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:13.158
DON'T WE GONNA DO. WE'RE GONNA.

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.726
ADD ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:15.794

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.696
POSITIONS WE PUT UP LAST YEAR

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:19.264
WE ONLY HAVE THREE POSITIONS

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.500
FILLED. NOBODY WOULD LAST AND

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:23.868
PRIVATE BUSINESS DOING THIS

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:24.502
KIND OF WORK AND IT'S

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.237
UNFORTUNATE THAT THE- THE

OF THE HARD WORK THAT THE

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:47.978
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE ON THIS

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.579
THEY SHOULD REALLY BE COMMENDED

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:50.447
FOR HOW THEY EMBRACE THIS I

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:51.948
THINK IT'S WORTH. ACKNOWLEDGING

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:52.883
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THE

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.317
LEGISLATURE TOLD THEM TO DO

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:55.685
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.053
CAME FORTH AND ASKED TO DO BUT

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.656
THEY REALLY DID EMBRACE IT- AND

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.491
REALLY RAN WITH IT AND PROVIDE

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:03.794
A LOT OF REALLY AND INFORMATION

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.628
THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:07.230
THE FUTURE. BUT INFORMATION IS

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.832
ONLY USEFUL AS LONG AS IT IS

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.234
USED SO I THINK THE NEXT STEP

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.236
IS REALLY. WHAT WE DO WITH THIS

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.105
INFORMATION AND OF COURSE PART

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.440
OF THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.507

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:20.577
RESPOND- BUT CERTAINLY ALSO THE

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:22.145
IN MINISTRATION AND SO I THINK

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.647
THE NEXT PHASE IS REALLY GOING

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.015

GOING TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS.

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.351
AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THOSE

00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:29.553
AREAS WILL RECEIVE THE LARGEST

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.188
GAPS IN THE SPECIES AND HABITAT

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.423
CONSERVATION AND- AND

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.459
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AREAS.

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.526
SO WHAT TIME IT IS A LITTLE BIT

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:37.794
AND THEN IN THE NEXT AGENDA

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:40.030
ITEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.965

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.867
DIFFICULT TIME GIVEN THEIR

SERVICE FACE BUDGETING. HAS

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.389
BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN

ADVOCATING FOR THE ENTIRE SIX

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:15.859
YEARS HAVE BEEN IN THIS

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:16.526
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:18.261
FRUSTRATING. DETERMINING THE

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:18.929
FUNDING PRIORITIES FOR THE

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.698

WITH THIS BUDGET SUB MOVING

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.807
THIS FORWARD AS WELL. I THINK

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:35.412
THAT IT DOES EXPOSE A REAL

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.747
ISSUE OF. SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:39.783
HOURS BEING SPENT PER YEAR ON

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.352

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:42.986
I'M HERE TO THE TWO POINT NINE

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.788
MILLION HOURS IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:45.789
WE NEED TO BE A NEED TO MISSION

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:49.292
RIGHT THAT'S A HUGE GAP- AND

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.261
JUST BEING CANDID IT'S WE'RE

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.496
BACK HERE EVERY YEAR- WHETHER

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.931
IT'S STATE PARKS OR ITS FISH

AND WILDLIFE. WITH ONE TIME

00:53:59.002 --> 00:53:59.502
FIXES. IN WHAT I WOULD HOPE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.071
RIGHT NOW WE LOOKING AT THE

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.072
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:03.540
IMPLEMENTATION IS NOW

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.241
DEVELOPING A LONG TERM PLAN TO

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.009
BE ABLE TO ASSIST THE

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.978
DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT'S FISHING

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:10.013
WILDLIFE IS WELL STATE PARKS.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.981
TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THIS

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.716
JUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT EVERY

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.050
TIME THERE'S A RECESSION HERE

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.819
AND BE THE FIRST TO BE CUT. AND

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:16.653
THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK FOR THE

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.921
THING WITH THESE RIDICULOUS FEE

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:20.590
INCREASE PROPOSALS. THAT WILL

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:24.194
NEVER FLY. QUESTION HERE SO I

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.095
GUESS I JUST WANT TO GET A

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.730
BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON THE

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.498
ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TO

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.033
MISTER DIRECTOR AGAIN I

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.501
SINCERELY MEANNESS I APPRECIATE

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:32.502
ALL YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.337
LEADERSHIP ON ALL ISSUES OF

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:35.572
FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE BUT

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.374
THE DEPARTMENT'S MEETING ABOUT

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.042
74% OF THE NEED FOR

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.444
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT BUT ONLY

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.946
26% WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIES

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:45.448
AND CONSERVATION NEEDS SO CAN

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.250
YOU TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT HOW

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:51.021
THIS PLAYED OUT. IN YOUR YOUR

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:54.024
THOUGHTS ON THE FINDINGS. SO

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.625
LET ME START WITH YOUR YOUR

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.594
SECOND QUESTION THE FINDINGS.

00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.195
BROADLY DON'T SURPRISE ME

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:03.299
BECAUSE IT'S A ISSUE MOST

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:03.900
EVERYONE IS A KNOWLEDGE FOR A

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:07.604
LONG TIME. WHAT DID SURPRISE ME

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:10.473
WAS THE SPECIFICITY AROUND HOW

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.644
BIG THE GAP IS. IN THOSE AREAS-

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.112
THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED SPECIES

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:18.014
AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:18.515
PERMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.950
PROTECTION. AND WHEN I'VE

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:23.953
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WAR. WHAT I

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.390
CONCLUDE IT IS. THOSE AREAS ARE

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:29.492
ACTUALLY ARGUABLY HARDER AREAS

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:33.663
FOR US TO FUND. BECAUSE A LOT

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.766
OF THAT WORK IS DRIVEN BY FEE

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:39.335
AND WE CAN'T FEED OURSELVES OUT

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.638
OF ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.740
WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED. WHICH

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:45.608
MEANS WHAT'S THE OTHER FUNDS

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.677
SOURCE AND HISTORICALLY THE

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.212
CONVERSATION HAS CENTERED IN ON

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.881
GENERAL FUND. AND OF COURSE

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:52.449
THERE ARE MANY CALLS ON THE

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:55.285
GENERAL FUND. SO FOR ME WHEN I

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:57.520
LOOK AT PERMITTING AND SPECIES

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.322
AND HABITAT CONSERVATION. WE

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.091
HAVE A VERY HIGH DEMAND FOR

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:04.160
THAT WERE. THOSE FOUR HUNDRED

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:07.630
NEW KIND OF ASSIGNMENTS SINCE

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.164
TWO THOUSAND ONE. BUT THE

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:09.899
SUPPLY TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.534
IS FEE BASED WHICH CAN ONLY

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.570
REALLY AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:16.439
THE WORK. FOR GENERAL. WE'VE

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:17.974
NEVER FIGURED OUT AN ADDITIVE

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.076
FUNDS SOURCE TO HELP US BRIDGE

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:23.079
THAT GAP OF CONVERSELY IF YOU

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.881
GO OVER TO ADD BEEN SUPPORT.

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.516
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:29.052
SERVICE LEVEL IS HIGHER. IS THE

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:29.819
WAY WE HANDLED WITHIN THE

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.921
DEPARTMENT. WE KIND OF THIS

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:34.724
CHARGE FOR ADMIN CROSS ALL OF

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:37.327
OUR DEPARTMENT. SUCH THAT WERE

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:39.629
ALWAYS BRINGING HAD MEN UP TO

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.765
SECURE THE CAUGHT THE SERVICE

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:44.934
LEVEL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT-

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.803
THAT'S I THINK WHY YOU SEE A

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.705
DIFFERENCE OVER ON ONE SIDE AND

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.640
THEN IN A DIFFERENCE OVER ON

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:51.474
THE OTHER SIDE PERMITTING

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.810
INSPECTIONS. THE RESEARCHER

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:55.879
TRYNA TURN THIS BACK OVER TO

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:56.846
THE CHAIR IN JUST ONE MOMENT%

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.014
NOW THE SAME RESEARCHER I THINK

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:58.882
THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.717
HAVE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. IS

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:03.653
THAT BECAUSE IT'S FEE BASED AND

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.921
THERE IS NO CONSISTENT FUNDING

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.489
WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD ONE TIME

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:08.358
MONEY FLOWS IN IN TIMES ARE BAD

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:09.726
THEY'RE SLASHED AND THEN WE

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:12.028
PLAYED MAKE UP. A TRYING TO BE

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.229
ABLE TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE CUTS

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:14.998
IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS AFTER THOSE

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:16.332
BAD YEARS WHICH IS MAKES THE

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.368
PROBLEM WORSE. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:19.803
HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:21.504
BUDGET SUB WHETHER IT'S THE

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:23.573
ISSUE OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.974
STATE PARKS BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.042
STILL IN THERE IN THAT SAME

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.510
POSITION. WORKING WITH THE

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:28.211
ADMINISTRATION ON WITHOUT

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.079
LONGER TERM OF TWENTY PLAN IS

IN MISTER CHAIR SHOULD. I WAIT

DEPARTMENT I TRIED TO RAISE

FEES ON COMMERCIAL FISHING I

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:26.095
THINK THAT'S WHAT MISTER

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:28.798
MCGUIRE WAS ALLUDING TO A

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:32.602
MOMENT AGO. I WE TRIED TO SOLVE

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.637
SOME OF THIS FUNDING BY USING

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.306
THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. WE

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:39.609
TRIED AND IDEA OF USING THE

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:42.211
TIRE RECYCLING PROGRAM CAL

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.646
RECYCLE. WE'VE TRIED

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:45.715
AUGMENTATIONS OF GENERAL FUND

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:47.250
INCLUDING LAST YEAR WHICH OF

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:49.786
COURSE RAN INTO THE PANDEMIC SO

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:52.789
I FEEL VERY BATTLE SCARRED. BUT

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.657
NOW WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HAVING

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:56.826
THIS DATA I DO SAYING SHOULD

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.128
PUT TO REST IN MY MIND AT LEAST

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.897
WHETHER THERE'S A PROBLEM AND

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.398
WHETHER WE SUBSTANTIATED THE

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:03.900
PROBLEM THERE'S AN ISSUE. I

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.702
THINK NEXT IS WHAT WHAT WE DO

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.738
ABOUT. GREAT CENTER STERN YOU

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:14.310
RECOGNIZE. THE PERFECT

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:18.781
TRANSITION DIRECTOR BOTTOM- SHE

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.084
DID THE DILIGENCE ON ALL THIS

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.251
AND PUTTING IT INTO STARK

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.087
RELIEF I MEAN THE CUT I WOULD I

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.289
GUESS FOR MY QUESTION IS I WANT

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.524
TO KNOW. YOU HAVE IT IN YEAH

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.426
THIS GAPS IN DOLLARS IT IN SOME

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.595
WAY I SAW IT IN HOURS AS ADAM

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.031
PERCENTAGES BUT LIKE I I'M

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.833
TRYING TO RIGHT SIZE EVERYONE'S

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.635
EXPECTATIONS HERE OF WHAT IT

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:42.472
REALLY MEANS. SAID TO MEET THIS

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.607
CHALLENGE SO IF WE APPROPRIATE

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.708
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.977
INSTANCE FOR ALL THE BACKLOG OF

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.379
FIRE MAINTENANCE THAT NEED TO

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:50.813
BE DONE IN ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.382
HABITATS THAT YOU ALL HELP

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:54.484
MANAGE. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.319
GETS YOU HOW FAR ON ONE OF

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:59.555
THOSE BAR CHARTS AND HOW MUCH

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:00.223
FURTHER DO WE NEED TO GET TO GO.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.858
SOONER THIS WILL ALSO COME UP

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:04.927
IN THE NEXT. AGENDA ITEM BUT-

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.496
HERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:09.932
UNDERSCORE. IT AS I'VE LEARNED

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.935
IN THIS BUSINESS DISCIPLINE OF

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.971
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING A

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.340
METRIC THE WIDGET YOU'RE USING

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.909
TO JUDGE IS NOT DOLLARS. IT'S

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:22.278
LABOR HOURS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.579
DOING IS YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.915
BENCHMARKING YOUR SERVICES

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.117
AGAINST ALL THE TASKS SO I'LL

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:31.054
EXAGGERATE. LIKE SAY A SERVICE

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.689
AREA IS UP WE CAN JOIN MEANT OF

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.224
YOUR LANDS THEN YOU'RE WORKING

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.226
BACKWARDS WELL WE HAVE SEVEN

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:39.462
HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROPERTIES.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:40.096
AND THEN YOU'RE DOING ALL THESE

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.899
TASKS LIKE CHANGE THE TOILET

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:43.499
PAPER IN THE RESTAURANT RIGHT

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.035
AND THEN YOU'RE FIGURING OUT

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.605
THE PERSON HOURS ACCUMULATED UP.

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.574
SO WE DON'T USE THE METRIC OF

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:54.944
MONEY. BY WE KNOW PERSON HOURS

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.146
LABOR HOURS AND WHAT THE DATA

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.681
IS SHOWING YOU IS A GENERALIZED

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:01.751
MATTER WERE UNDER IT'S ABOUT A

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.719
THREE AXIS PROBLEM. RIDE SO

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.555
THEN WHAT ONE CAN DO AND OF

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.056
LOGIC WISE IS REALIZE WE'RE

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.225
ABOUT THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.861
AND OUR ANNUAL BUDGET IS ABOUT

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.629
YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:15.531
MILLION DOLLAR. BOUNCES AROUND.

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:16.833
SO THEN YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:19.168
THREE ACTS PROBLEM MEANS NOW

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.237
THAT TIMES THREE. IT DOESN'T

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.805
WORK OUT THAT WAY IN EVERY

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.841
ISSUE BUT IT'S SOME GENERALIZED

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.743
IT WAYS. AND THAT'S I THINK

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.845
REALLY THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.746
MOVE INTO THE QUESTION AROUND

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.816
MONEY PER SE BECAUSE THE

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:34.350
ANALYSIS IS DRIVEN AROUND

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.686
PERSONALS. NOW CAN I TELL YOU

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.388
WITH EACH INVESTMENT HOW THE

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.891
GAP MAY SHRINK KIND OF. I THINK

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.359
WHAT THE TOOL ALLOWS DID WAS

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.961
ILLUSTRATE THE GAP AND

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:47.096
UNDERSTAND WHERE IT MAY EXIST.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.631
IT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.366
INVESTMENTS FOR RETURN ON

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.368
INVESTMENT AND REMEMBER THAT

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.936
SLIDE IS NOT ALWAYS YOU NEED TO

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:57.006
ADD HE Y. YOU CAN. DO ONE TIME

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.775
AND TECHNOLOGY YOU COULD CHANGE

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.577
YOUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES.

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:04.080
THE OTHER THING IS THE TOOL

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.249
REALLY ISN'T SET UP ONLY

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:09.318
PROJECT OR PREDICT THE FUTURE.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.787
IT'S MORE SET UP TO TAKE EACH

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.956
YEAR AFTER THE FACT AND SCRUB

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.325
THE NUMBERS AND SEE WHAT

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:19.228
CHANGES WITHIN THAT LABOR OUR

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.164
AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS KIND

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.965
OF SCRUB THE NUMBERS AGAIN. SO

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.734
I DON'T HAVE COMPLETE OVERSIGHT

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.335
WITH THE TOOL I THINK YOU CAN

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:26.903
MAKE SOME REASONABLE

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.505
PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW IT WILL

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:30.806
HELP WHAT I HAVE IS AFTER THE

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.876
FACT. YEAH THE NUMBERS IT'S GOT

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:38.114
TO GO- DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.682
BESIDES AFTER THE FACT NUMBERS

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.350
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS DESPITE

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.619
YOUR SCARS HERE ANY ANY GREAT

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.688
IDEAS HOW DO WE FIX THIS. ARE

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.390
YOU CAN I MEAN THERE'S IN KICK

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:48.758
IT TO US TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:51.360
OUT BUT- I THINK I MEAN I WOULD

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:54.997
I WOULD URGE YOU TO. JUST WHERE

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:58.201
THOSE CARS AS YOU KNOW BATON.

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.869
MEDALS OF HONOR OF SOME SORT

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:03.306
AND KEEP COMING BACK. WE NEED.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.141
WE NEED SOME KIND OF CREATIVITY

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.677
HERE- AND BONDS ARE GOING TO

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.745
FIX THIS. RIGHT I MEAN IT'S

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:12.281
WE'RE TALKING OPERATIONS. FOR A

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:15.117
LOT OF IT SO. ANY ANY NEW

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:23.459
BRIGHT IDEAS. TWO ANSWERS TO

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.696
THAT QUESTION. BUT OF COURSE.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:28.231
IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.533
LIKE TO WAY AND NOW I'M BE GLAD

TO SEE A HAND RAISED BY. FIRST

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:35.972
ANSWER IS. YOUR STAFF RECOMMEND

HOLD OPEN I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:39.809
WHEN WE GET TO ISSUE TWENTY

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:43.312
NINE. AND IN MY OPINION I'VE

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.615
EXPERIENCED HOLD OPEN IS A WAY

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.016
IN WHICH DISCUSSIONS CONTENT

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:50.086
CAN CONTINUE. AND THEN SECONDLY

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.760
THAT THE DIRECTOR HAD WAS ON

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.762
DIFFERENT APPROACHES- THAT

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.398
COULD BE USED TO ASPHALT THE

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:36.899

AND EQUIPMENT WHICH REALLY DOES

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:48.577
HOLD INTO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.313
WE'RE WE'RE MAKING SOME KIND OF

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:52.381
INITIAL ONE TIME. SIGNIFICANT

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.050
INVESTMENT AND DIFFERENT

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.085

WILL HELP REDUCE THAT GAP AND

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.991
THEN THIRD WHICH IS THE BIGGEST

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:03.092
PIECE OF THE LABOR HOURS WHICH

PART OF THE- STATE THAT TAKING

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.881
A STEP BACK AND THE OVERALL

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.883
BUDGET FRAMEWORK. I WE ARE

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.152
LOOKING OVERALL AT WHAT WE CAN

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:32.922
DO TO MAKE EFFICIENCIES- AND

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.056
JUST MAKE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:35.958
WITH A ONE TIME INVESTMENT. BUT

OF GREAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.007
TO DIG IN FURTHER AND SEE WHAT

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.175
THE BEST AND MOST APPROPRIATE

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.711

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.580
THIRD OF WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.516
TO BE DOING CAN YOU. OUR

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:51.020
COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I MEAN I

THE DATA IN IN PICTURE FORM

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.525

BRING YOUR EYES TO IT AND I

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.897
THINK IT IS- PARTICULAR.

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.099
STRIKING THAT THE LARGEST GAPS

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:07.202
AND THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HOURS

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:09.838
NEEDED TO MEET THE MISSION- ARE

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.574
IN THOSE KIND OF CORE PUBLIC

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.676
TRUST AREAS THE SPECIES

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:14.944
PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.779
PROTECTION WHERE THE DEPARTMENT

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.414
HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.949
BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC TO HOLD

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:24.987
OUR OUR RESOURCES M. TO PROTECT

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.822
AND CONSERVE OUR RESOURCES. AND

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.324
ALSO I THINK WORTH HIGHLIGHTING

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.425
THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.993
AREAS THAT WILL FACE INCREASING

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.494
CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF CLIMATE

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.997
CHANGE- AND SO THAT THE NUMBER

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.298
OF HOURS TO MEET THE MISSION

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:39.134
COULD. HAVE CONCEIVABLY GROW IN

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.202
THE COMING YEARS AND COULD TAKE

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:41.870
A ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:45.507
SO- I THINK I THINK THAT THAT

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:46.442
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.510

OF THE PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.783

THINGS WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:45.173
JUST THAT MOUNTAIN MOST OF

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.808
THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT FOCUS

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.143
ON THE SPECIES AND HABITAT

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.844
CONSERVATION AREA THAT WAS

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.146
HIGHLIGHTED AS WHERE THE

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:54.482
BIGGEST GAP IS. ONE EIGHT ONE

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.417
THAT DOES IS THE VEGETATION

STATE FOR THE VEGETATION

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:09.030
MAPPING OR SOME OTHER ONE TIME

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:11.199

AREA THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:22.244

JUSTIFIABLY BE FUNDED THROUGH

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:32.087

THAT TELLS YOU HOW THE TAX SO

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.862
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- PROBLEMS

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.864
IS WITH MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:50.465

MIGRATORY BIRD LYSONS AND SO IS

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.441
THERE SOME WAY TO DIGITIZE THAT

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:02.310
SO THAT. YOU COULD JUST PUT MY

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.211
NAME IN BRIAN DOLLY AND YOU

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:05.113
KNOW. WHAT I'VE ALREADY

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.981
PURCHASED THAT I PURCHASED MY

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.050
TECH ONLINE SO I KNOW YOU HAVE

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.852
A STAMP ON THE FEDERAL SIDE.

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.854
FOR LIKE A MIGRATORY BIRD BUT

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.889
YOU'RE UP LINK UP JAN GAME AND

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:15.990

SIDE. ARE RIGHT ON YOUR RIGHT

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.494
ON YOUR LICENSE SO IS THERE

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.162
SOME WAY WE COULD. MAKE THAT SO

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.397
THAT THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.631
ENCOUNTER WITH THE WARDEN THEY

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.166
GO HEY WHERE'S YOUR ID YOU SHOW

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:26.334

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:27.802
IT THEY KNOW WHAT YOU. AND THEY

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:31.272
ARE ABLE TO TOUCH THEIR

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:31.873
COMPUTER AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.109
YOU PURCHASED. YES THAT'S WHERE

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.845
WE'RE HEADED. AWESOME THAT'S-

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:40.148
PART OF. THE THEORY BEHIND THIS.

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:43.151
A MINUTE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:46.421
MAY NOT GET THERE COMPLETELY

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:46.988
YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT BUDGET

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:49.858
YEAR. OFTEN WHEN WE'RE DOING

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.326
TECHNOLOGY CHANGE WE HAVE A

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:52.994
FAIR AMOUNT OF PROCESS WE NEED

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:53.895
TO GO THROUGH WITH THAT.

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:57.665
CALIFORNIA ARMINE TECHNOLOGY

01:23:57.732 --> 01:24:00.835
AND SENATOR ANOTHER ASPECT

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:04.406
WITHIN THIS SPACE IS- WHEN YOU

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.975
PURCHASE A LICENSE PARTICULARLY

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.844
WITH FISHING. OUR WHOLE WAY HAS

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.046
BANNED ITS GOOD FOR JUST THE

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:13.948
REMAINDER OF THE CALENDAR YEAR

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.583
OF COURSE IF YOU BUY IT IN

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.452
SEPTEMBER IT'S NOT AS- BAD AS

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.521
MUCH VALUE IF YOU HAD BOTHERED

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.189
AND- YOU KNOW JANUARY. AND

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.057
WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO ENSURE HE

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:26.428
IS. FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.662
IT'S GOOD FOR THREE HUNDRED

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.531
SIXTY FIVE DAYS. ALL OF THESE

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.499
ARE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.701
WHICH CAN INCREASE THE ABILITY

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.869
FOR PEOPLE TO BREAK THE

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:38.106
BARRIER. AND BE OUTSIDE WAR.

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:40.208
BEING OUTSIDE MORE AS PUBLIC

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:42.744
HEALTH BENEFITS IT'S ONE OF THE

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:43.311
THINGS WE'RE NOTICING IN THE

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:46.848
PANDEMIC. AND AS THE FEES OUR

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.116
HUNTERS AND ANGLERS IN THE

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.084
STATE THEY DON'T PAY THE

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.454
HIGHEST FEES IN THE NATION- BUT

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.922
THEY PAY SOME OF THE HIGHEST

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:56.658
FEES- I DO THINK THERE IS A

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.460
BROAD BENEFIT WHEN WE CAN MAKE

01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:00.662
THESE TECHNOLOGY. IMPROVEMENTS

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.096
FOR HUNTERS AND ANGLERS I AM IN

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.398
FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU I

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:04.966
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:07.535
LOOKING AT. THE AROUND IT

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.470
WHENEVER YOU PURCHASED A

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:09.838
LICENSE IT'S GOOD FOR LIKE A

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:11.206
FISHING LICENSE THREE OR SIXTY

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.907
FIVE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.409
THEM IN MY OPINION THIS IS A

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:14.976
PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD SPEND

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:15.977
MORE MONEY BECAUSE I THINK

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:17.912
YOU'LL ACTUALLY. RECEIVE MORE

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:19.914
MONEY IF THE PROCESS WORKS IN A

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.749
BETTER WAY AND IT LOOK. THOSE

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:23.785
OF US WHO UDERSTAND. THE

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.720
IMPORTANCE OF GETTING OUT IN

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.455
THE IN THE OUTDOORS AND

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:29.190
RECREATION IN THE FAMILY VALUES

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:30.859
IN THOSE THINGS. IT'S NOT SO

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.627
MUCH THE MONEY IT'S IT IT'S

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:34.295
ABOUT MAKING IT EASY SO WE CAN

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.931
ABIDE BY THE LAWS AND ACTUALLY.

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:38.333
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AND

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:39.834
ENJOY THE THINGS AND THOSE OF

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.135
US WHO ARE CARED ABOUT THE

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:42.370
PROTECTIONS WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.905
THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING. A FISH

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.640
IN THE WRONG PLACE OR OR IT'S

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.141
JUST CASUALLY SORT OF BARTLETT

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:48.309
TOOK I MEAN THERE'S ALL KINDS

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:50.712
OF AS YOU KNOW. RESTRICTIONS

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.280
AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THOSE

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.147
BUT WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:56.217
DOING RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE.

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:57.352
YOUR WORK ON THIS. AND I

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.386
THOUGHT WHEN THE RANGER PUT

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.154
YOUR NAME IN THE MACHINE IT LIT

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.423
UP LIKE A LAS VEGAS SIDE. SLOT

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.492
MACHINES NOW THAT'S A- VERY

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.927
GOOD THAT'S A CLARIFICATION

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.562
SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:10.098
MUCH AT MR HERE. I'LL BE QUICK

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:11.533
LOOK I THINK THE ONE THING I

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.968
JUST WANNA SAY IN REGARDS TO

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:14.969
YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR SAID

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.871
BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL FOUR

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:17.438
HUNDRED MANDATE SIX ADDRESS

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:18.873
THAT'S BEEN ADVANCED BY. THE

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.041
LEGISLATURE IS ONE OF THE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.776
REASONS WHY THEY'RE SEEN-

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:22.944
CHALLENGES WITH THEIR BUDGET

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.580
BUT- I GUESS THIS IS IT. BEGS

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.048
THE QUESTION WHY DOESN'T THE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:27.916
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:28.983
ADVANCE SOMEBODY CHANGE

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.818
RIPPLES. IF THEY NEED TO BE

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:31.920
ABLE TO SEE A DIFFERENT

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.821
DOLLARS. THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:34.656
THE DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.124
WELCOME TO GO TO PUT ADDITIONAL

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:36.991
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:39.027
FORWARD. TO BE A RECOVER WHAT

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.662
THOSE POTENTIAL MANDATES MAYBE.

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.430
I THINK THAT GETS US BACK TO

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:44.098
THE BIG PICTURE. IS THAT. LOOK

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.434
THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE. IN THIS

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:47.335
FORTY FIVE MILLION. I THINK IT

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.404
MAKES SENSE. I DON'T

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.871
NECESSARILY AGREE THE

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.205
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.106
WHEN HE SAYS WHY DON'T WE JUST

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.508
KEEP GOING IN AND POTENTIALLY

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:55.243
LOOKING AT USER FEE INCREASES

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.511
WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT USER FEE

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.879
INCREASES. IT'S NOT A

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.447
SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY. FOR THE

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:00.481
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:02.417
OR ANYOTHER DEPARTMENT- IF

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.385
WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING-

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:07.255
WILDLIFE. AND CONSERVATION. AND

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.290
HABITAT. THEN WE HAVE TO PUT

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:10.091
OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:12.126
AND DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN.

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.261
TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.129
RESOURCES IN THE STATE.

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:15.964
ESPECIALLY IN THE AGE OF

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:17.565
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WE'RE NEVER

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:19.067
GONNA GET AHEAD IF WE'RE DOING

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.401
THIS YEAR BY YEAR. AND THAT'S

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.236
WHAT WE'VE CONTINUED TO FOR SIX

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:23.571
FLIPPING YEARS WE'VE DONE THIS

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.373
YEAR BY YEAR. AND I SAY THAT

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.008
IS. THIS ISN'T JUST THE

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.810
LEGISLATURE'S FAULT. THIS IS

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.011
JUST AS MUCH. THE

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.479
ADMINISTRATION'S FAULT THE

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:32.814
DEPARTMENT'S FAULT. FOR NOT

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.015
PUTTING FORWARD A BUDGET CHANGE

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.383
PROPOSAL. THAT'S THE BOTTOM

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:36.651
LINE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:37.952
THAT WE HAVE THAT. THAT

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:39.420
CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:43.024
CRITICAL. BECAUSE I HEAR ABOUT

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.059
THE MANDATES. BUT AGAIN. DURING

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:47.695
ANY BUDGET- LONG TERM FULL TIME

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:50.431
FINDING IS ALWAYS WELCOME- BYE

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:51.899
ONE QUESTION I WOULD SAY TO.

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.201
THE DIRECTOR MISTER DIRECTOR

IN THIS IS. VERY SPECIFIC TO

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:00.341
THE NORTH COAST. BUT IT WOULD

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:00.975
BE GREAT TO GET A UPDATE ON THE

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.710
L. STAY. OUT FOR. HOME AND I

DIRECTOR WE CAN TAKE THAT OFF

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.014
LINE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.582
INFORMATION AND EXPECT YOU TO

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.150

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.143
KIND OF FAMILIAR BECAUSE WE

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:12.046
PROPOSED MANY OF THEM ALMOST A

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:14.415
YEAR AGO. AND THEY ALL HAD TO

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:16.951
BE TABLED ON BECAUSE OF THE

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.120
ECONOMIC KIND OF. WHIPLASH

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:20.288
COMING OUT OF THE CODED

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.390
EXPERIENCE WHICH A YEAR AGO WAS

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.192
MUCH NEWER FOR ALL OF US. THIS

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.394

STAKEHOLDER. I HAVE ENGAGEMENT

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.531

THROUGH WHAT MIGHT BE A BROADLY

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:34.268
REPRESENTATIVE SAID A ONE TIME

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:36.537
INVESTMENTS THAT ENOUGH OF OUR

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.172
DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS MAY BE

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:41.175
ABLE TO SEE THEIR INTEREST AND-

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.745
ALSO THE CANNABIS WE HAVE A

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.346
GRANTING PROGRAM UNDER PROP

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.615

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:53.588
INTENDED- ENGAGEMENT WITH EACH

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:54.756
OF THE COUNTIES PARTICULARLY

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.991
THE SHERIFF LEVEL. THOSE ARE

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.292

THESE ARE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:09.804
WHICH IS WHY. IN MY OPINION LA-

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.940
MAKES A FAIR CRITIQUE OF THIS

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.776
ONE TIME PACKAGE YOU'RE NOT

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:17.178
INVESTING AND SPECIES OR

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.413
PERMITTING. MY ANSWER IS TO

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.815
REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THOSE

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.984
SPACES. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.952
ONGOING PERMANENT INVESTMENT

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.355

KIND OF MULTI YEAR. BUT THE ONE

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.617
TIME MULTI YEAR APPROACH COULD

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.485

LEAST BEING YOUR SERVICE BASED

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:30.271
BUDGETING. THINKING RIGHT OF

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.006
WHERE IN SOME OF THOSE EARLY. I

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.107
DON'T COME SHOVEL READY MISSION

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.809
DRIVEN MULTI YEAR INITIATIVES

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.077
THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:39.914
TO DO RIGHT NOW- CAN EITHER OF

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:40.481

PROBABLY DIRECTED BETTER

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:49.056
POSITION THAT THAT EXAMPLE WE

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.157
GAVE IN OUR REPORT WAS THE ONE

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:51.325
THAT SENATOR STERN MENTIONED

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:53.694
WHICH IS THAT RECOVERY PLANS

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:54.862
FOR INDIVIDUAL SPECIES THAT

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.197
SEEM LIKE A DISCRETE ACTIVITY

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.098
BECAUSE AS YOU. AS YOU

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.332
MENTIONED SENATOR IF IT'S ONE

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.900
TIME MONEY EVEN FOR SPRING AND

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.268
ACROSS MULTIPLE YEARS WE WANT

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.436
TO BE SURE THAT IT'S A DISCRETE

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.105
ACTIVITY THAT DOESN'T KIND OF.

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:06.173
LIVE LONGER THAN THE FUNDING SO

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.575
THAT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.543
DISCRETE ACTIVITY TO US AND

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.112
WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED IN LAST

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:12.179
YEAR'S BUDGET FOR ONGOING

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:15.950
FUNDING THAT THEN- HAD TO BE

01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:17.018
RETRACTED DUE TO THE- AND- I

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.586
MAKE. PHYSICAL CONDITION BUT

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.987
WITH GETTING AT THOSE SPECIES

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:22.356
AND HABITAT CONSERVATION GOAL

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:24.759
THAT WE HAVE ARTICULATED- THAT

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.560
THAT R. AS BEST PRESENT IN THIS

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.029
PACKAGE BUT DR BONHAM OUGHT.

01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:31.232
FOR TO YOU. IS SANDRA I'LL TRY

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:34.135
TO. THINK OF OUR EXAMPLE

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:37.838
HYPOTHETICAL THAT MAY RESONATE

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:40.007
WITH THE PANEL THE MEMBERS. SO

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:43.277
I CAN THINK OF TO. SO WE

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.713
PROPOSE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.148
TO PURCHASE A NEW OR FIXED WING

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:50.951
AIRCRAFT. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:53.954
CLOSE TO COMPLETING A FEDERAL

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.423
PERMITTING PROCESS TO GET THE

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.358
FIRST EVER OCEAN HABITAT

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:00.194
CONSERVATION PLAN FOR WALES. I

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:02.797
THINK IN THE NATION. AND WE

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:04.598
HAVE NEWLY CREATED STATE

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.934
REGULATIONS TRYING TO MANAGE

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.335
THE DELICACY BETWEEN MARINE

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:10.404
MAMMALS AND ONE OF OUR MOST

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:11.005
IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL FISHERIES

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:13.974
CRAP. SO IF ONE WERE TO THINK

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.476
ABOUT THE FUTURE I COULD

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.211
PROJECT WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.346
WORK IN THIS SPACE. AND THIS

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.115
ADDITIONAL WORK COULD MEAN YOU

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:23.451
TRY TO BUILD OUT- MARINE MAMMAL

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:26.387
PROGRAM. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IF

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.389
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE LESS

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:30.357
THAN TEN MONTHS OF WALES. AND

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.159
WE CAN KEEP A COMMERCIAL

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:34.128
DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY THAT'S

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.130
IN OUR THIRD MOST VALUABLE FOR

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.065
HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. SO

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.033
YOU COULD USE THE ONE TIME

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.801
INVESTMENT TO GET A BOMB AND

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.069
YOU COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:43.838
OVER TIME HOW YOU TAILOR THAT

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.739
TOOK US. I GIVE YOU ANOTHER

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:49.977
EXAMPLE. NOW LANDS NOT THAT I

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.445
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT AN

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:54.248
INTEREST OF YOURS- SO AS YOU

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:55.583
KNOW WE'RE GOING THROUGH OUR

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:58.285
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS TO DETERMINE

01:35:58.352 --> 01:35:58.752
WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.654
PROTECTED UNDER STATE LAW.

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:01.722
WHETHER THEY SHOULD OR

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.824
SHOULDN'T THE FACT IS THEY

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.559
EXIST ACROSS LARGE PARTS OF

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.495
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:09.697
SAME TIME WE NEED TO MODERNIZE

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:10.264
A LOT OF OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:13.033
GRID. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.502
TRANSPORTATION WHILE LIFE AT

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:15.936
THE SAME TIME YOU CAN THINK

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:19.206
ABOUT CONNECTIVITY. SO YOU MAY

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:22.710
BE. YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING A

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:23.944
ONE TIME INVESTMENT AROUND

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.846
CREATING CHANGES TO CAPTURE

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.314
ANIMALS WHEN THEY'RE IN HARM'S

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.583
WAY AND MOVE THEM YOU CAN ALSO

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.719
BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.787
BRING A MARRIAGE- BETWEEN

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.956
TRANSPORTATION WILDLIFE SIMPLY

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:37.491
BILL TWELVE EIGHTY TWO STARTED

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.326
THIS. AND THEN THINK ORIGINALLY

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.195
ABOUT CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.696
WELL TO DO THAT YOU NEED PEOPLE

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.331
WHO CAN DO MAPPING IN PLANNING

01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:45.799
AND YOU ALMOST NEED A MULTI

01:36:45.866 --> 01:36:47.968
UNIT YOU KNOW IT NEVER. I THINK

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:50.304
THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT.

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:53.007
HERE'S THE CABBIE OUT- YOU KNOW

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.742
LAST YEAR IN THIS WE'RE IN A

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:57.044
TOUGH ECONOMIC SITUATION AND I

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:59.313
YOU KNOW I'M FOCUSED ON ONE

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.348
TIME BECAUSE ONGOING AND

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.317
PERMANENT IS MORE CHALLENGING.

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:04.919
WHERE DO I FIND REVENUE SOURCES

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:08.622
FROM GOING IN PERMITTING. V. P.

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.157
N. CREASES WON'T DO IT GENERAL

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.493
FUND IS CHALLENGING YEAH THAT'S

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.261
PART AND PARCEL OF THE STRUGGLE

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.197
I THINK AND IF YOU KNOW FINANCE

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:18.032
WITH ONE AWAY IN THERE I THINK

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:21.368
THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF THE-

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.204
DESIRE. BUT THE DIFFICULT. BUT

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:24.438
I WOULD BE I WOULD APPRECIATE

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:26.273
IN IN SAY JUST GIVEN OUR LAST

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.342
CUT- THE LAST ISSUE WE SORT OF

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:31.212
WRESTLED WITH. WHAT'S A STABLE

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:32.179
FUNDING STRATEGY COULD LOOK

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:34.481
LIKE BUT IS THERE A VERSION AT

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:36.650
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THAT

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:39.486
SORT OF MAKES OF. ONE TIME

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:41.388
STARTED AT CAPITAL INVESTMENT

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.623
THE DIRECTORS TALKING ABOUT BUT

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:45.092
THEN MAYOR BUT THAT'S SORT OF

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:47.361
MARRIAGE TO- YOU ARE I DON'T

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.896
CALL IT A FULL ON GOING BUT I

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:51.465
GUESS- A MISSION COMMITMENT

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:54.001
THAT KIND OF MULTI YEAR BASIS

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:56.270
IS THEIR OPENNESS TO THAT. THAT

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:58.172
KIND OF HYBRIDIZED APPROACH IF

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:03.110
YOU WILL. SIR DR APARNA

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:05.246
FINANCE. YEAH I THINK I WOULD

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:07.481
SAY AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:10.751
WE DID LAST- RELATED TO. THE

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:12.086
STATEWIDE BOBCAT MANAGEMENT

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:14.688
PLAN THAT WAS. LIKE THE FIRST

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:15.923
TWO YEARS WERE HIGHER

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:17.458
INVESTMENT I THINK A COUPLE

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.393
MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IT-

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.928
PROVIDED A KIND OF A SMALLER

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.363
ALLOCATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT

01:38:22.429 --> 01:38:23.564
THE OUT YEARS THAT DID ALL THE

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.199
ONE EXAMPLE OF YOU KNOW ARE

01:38:25.266 --> 01:38:27.034
VERY RECENT. REVOLTED BY THE

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:28.936
MINISTRATION WHERE IT IS NOT IN

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.437
THE SPECIES MONITORING REALM

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:31.639
WHERE WE DID KIND OF TAKE A

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:33.307
HYBRID APPROACH OF A LITTLE BIT

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.708
HIGHER INVESTMENT IN THEFIRST

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:35.909
COUPLE YEARS ACKNOWLEDGING

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:38.012
AVAILABILITY ONE TIME BUT THEN-

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.513
KIND OF WAR A MORE MODERATE-

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.382
OUT HERE- SO YOU KNOW THAT

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:42.850
THERE ARE EXAMPLES THAT YOU

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:44.318
KNOW IT RECENTLY. I HAVE A LAST

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:47.688
YEAR ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE-

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.089
IN THAT KIND OF SCENARIO I YOU

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.391
KNOW AGAIN YOU KNOW OPEN TO

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:52.626
CONVERSE. ON THIS I BEEN JUST

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.962
KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGE- STAFF

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:57.197
CAPACITY WEIGHT WITHIN THE

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.699
DEPARTMENT AND SO IT'S AN

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.668
EXPENSE THERE IS- YOU KNOW.

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:03.003
ADDITIONAL NEEDS THAT REQUIRE

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:05.172
STAFFING AND THEN YOU REQUIRE

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.740
PERMIT LEVEL STAFFING BUT THERE

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:09.543
IS ISN'T AN AGREEMENT- NO LEVEL

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.011
OF FUNDING FOR THEIR STAFFING

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.546
THEN YOU'RE CREATING I NOW YOUR

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.082
GAP. OR YOU HAVE PERMITS THAT

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.517
POTENTIALLY BUT THEY'RE NOT THE

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:18.252
FUNDING BEHIND IT AND THAT DOES

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:20.154
CREATE YOU KNOW LIABILITY THEN

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.455
IT KIND OF ONGOING FUNDING

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.123
LIABILITY AND SO I THINK YOU

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:24.258
KNOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.393
DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS- BUT

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.928
YOU KNOW AS AS HE DOUBLED FROM

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.496
LAST YEAR WHICH WHICH WE DID.

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:31.198
PUT INTO THE BUDGET OTHER

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:37.471

ENGAGEMENT THERE. YEAH THOSE

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:41.642

ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AND

01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:59.766
A BIG PIECE OF THE INVESTMENT

STIMULUS- YOU KNOW BROUGHT. AND

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:12.012
SO. IT IS PART OF THE BALANCING

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.246
OF THE PARTY THAN THE BUDGET WE

ONGOING- FLOOD PROTECTION AND

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:31.471
MAINTENANCE. IS HOW WE CONNECT

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:32.772
STATE DOLLARS WITH LOCAL

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:34.674
DOLLARS WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS

APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS HE'S

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:41.581
WORKING WITH STATE

STATE SIDE WE'VE GROWN THIS

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:52.092
BACKLOG OF DEFERRED

WHICH PASSED I THINK IN TWO

01:48:57.797 --> 01:49:00.033
THOUSAND SIX. WE JUST FINISHED

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.035
SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY REALLY

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:04.271
IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THAT'S

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:05.572
CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT IT TAKES

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:07.540
A LONG TIME AND PART OF WHY IT

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:09.643
TAKES A LONG TIME IS- HOW WE

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:10.944
CONNECT ALL THESE VARIOUS

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:14.014

HAS ESSENTIALLY GENERATED WHAT

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:21.354
WE'VE ESTIMATED AS ABOUT. SIX

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:24.925
pBACKLOG IN MAINTENANCE FOR HIGH

PRIORITY MAINTENANCE THE

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.529
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT- IS

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:31.398
PART OF THIS REQUEST TODAY. FOR

HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS OUR

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:34.901
TOTAL HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT

FIFTY MILLION- WE HAVE A LONG

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:41.107
LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ARE IN

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.876
THE QUEUE IF YOU WILL AND-

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:45.011
THESE ARE THINGS LIKE- LET THE

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:46.680
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:50.750
OF THINGS SO. THAT'S THE

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:53.486
BROADER CONTEXT OF THE NEED I

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:55.789
THINK AS A GENERAL MATTER- IF

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.924
OUR IF THE STATE CONTINUES TO

01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:00.060
IMPROVE ECONOMICALLY AND WE SEE

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.561
THE POTENTIAL FOR CLIMATE

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.663
RESILIENCY BOND- IT'S BEEN A

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:06.766
WHILE- SINCE THE STATE HAS HAD-

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:09.002
BOND ISSUES THAT ARE INVESTING.

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:11.538
IN FLOOD PROTECTION NINE PROP

01:50:11.604 --> 01:50:13.373
ONE WE HAD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.542
MILLION AND WHAT WE CALL MULTI

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:16.710
BENEFIT FLOOD PROTECTION

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:18.545
PROJECTS AND I'M PART OF THAT

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.447
WAS BECAUSE- WE WERE STILL

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.215
WORKING ON OUR PROPOSITION ONE

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:24.951
EIGHTY- AND DISTRIBUTION OF

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.620
DOLLARS. SO THAT'S SORT OF THE

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:29.222
FULLER CONTEXT IN TERMS OF

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:32.125
FUNDING NEEDED FLOOD AND- HOW

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:33.226

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.824
ECONOMIC. INEQUALITY IN THOSE

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:18.825
SORTS OF THINGS SO THE

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:20.927
DEPARTMENT REALLY WANTS TO DO

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.762
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO GET

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.297
MONEY OUT THE DOOR AS QUICKLY

01:58:24.363 --> 01:58:25.998
AS POSSIBLE IN THESE

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:27.300
COMPETITIVE GRANT MAKING

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:29.335
PROGRAMS AND WE THINK WE CAN DO

01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:31.871
THIS- WITH- THIS KIND OF A

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.806
BUDGET ALLOCATION BUT POINT

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:35.875
CERTAINLY NOTED OBVIOUSLY BY

01:58:35.942 --> 01:58:38.544
THE L. A. MISSY TAYLOR SWIFT

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:40.513
BUT CAN YOU LET US KNOW ABOUT

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:44.283
THE- WHY THIS IS SORT OF AN

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:45.785
UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COST.

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:47.420
YEAH THANK YOU MR CHAIR-

01:58:47.487 --> 01:58:48.788
RETAILERS WITH THE LEGEND LAST

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:51.691
OFFICE SO WE- WE DO IN

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:53.359
REVIEWING THIS AGREE WITH THE

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:54.393
DEPARTMENT ANY ADMINISTRATION

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.496
THAT THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY M.

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:57.563
AS A DIRECTOR MENTION THESE

01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:59.398
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS.

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:00.633
HAVE THAT KIND OF DUAL

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.068
CHALLENGE OF THEIR THEIR THE

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:03.536
MOST OUT OF BALANCE AND THEY

01:59:03.603 --> 01:59:04.904
HAVE THE MOST EXPEDITED

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.239
TIMELINES FOR GETTING BACK INTO

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:07.139
BALANCE SO WE THINK IT'S A

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:08.741
WORTHWHILE STATE INVESTMENT IT

01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:10.142
IS JUST THE TIMING ISSUE THAT

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:13.246
WE RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT-

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:14.947
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET DOLLARS

01:59:15.014 --> 01:59:16.249
EARLY I THINK PROBABLY EVERY

01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:17.283
DEPARTMENT YOU WOULD TALK TO

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:18.618
WOULD SAY YES WE WOULD. LIKE AN

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:20.520
EARLY ACTION ITEM SO WE CAN

01:59:20.586 --> 01:59:22.321
START A FEW MONTHS EARLY- BUT

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:24.056
WE THINK YOU KNOW AS WE HAVE

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.392
I'VE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS-

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.660
COMMITTEE HEARINGS THERE

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:29.262
THERE'S A PRETTY HIGH THRESHOLD

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:30.062
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:31.631
ABOUT GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT

01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:34.200
DOES LIMIT YOUR- FLEXIBILITY

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:34.834
WHEN YOU COME TO PUTTING

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:36.202
TOGETHER YOUR WHOLE BUDGET

01:59:36.269 --> 01:59:37.737
PACKAGE IN JUNE WHEN YOU HAVE

01:59:37.803 --> 01:59:39.305
TAKEN DOLLARS OFF THE TABLE AS

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:40.673
EARLY. AND WE DON'T THINK THAT

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.408
THIS MEETS THAT HIGH THRESHOLD

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:44.277
IT'S NOT A CRITICAL EMERGENCY

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:46.846
IT'S NOT RESPONDING TO COATED-

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:48.814
THESE ARE LONG TERM PROJECTS

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.816
THAT WILL TAKE. MANY MONTHS IF

01:59:50.883 --> 01:59:52.084
NOT YEARS TO UNDERTAKE SO

01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:53.953
WAITING A FEW MORE MONTHS AND

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:56.689
THERE IS- BROCK PROP SIXTY

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:57.723
EIGHT DOLLARS THAT ARE IN

01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:59.258
PROCESS NOW THAT WON'T GET OUT

01:59:59.325 --> 02:00:01.193
THE DOOR UNTIL MAY. SO WE THINK

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:01.994
WAITING A FEW MORE MONTHS

02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:03.796
RUNNING ONE GRANT CYCLE RATHER

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:05.631
THAN TO THAT ARE JUST A FEW

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:08.100
MONTHS APART- WELL WILL NOT

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.135
ONLY BE KIND OF

02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:10.803
ADMINISTRATIVELY EASIER FOR THE

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:12.405
DEPARTMENT AND FOR APPLICANTS

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:14.473

LOT MORE SENSE- SO WE WOULD

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:19.312

IDENTIFY THAT THE THIRTY

02:00:46.172 --> 02:00:47.206
MILLION BEING PROPOSED IN THE

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:48.541
CURRENT YEAR REALLY ALIGNS WITH

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:49.575
THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:53.279
EFFORTS- TO- PROVIDE ECONOMIC

THE ACCELERATING OUT THIRTY

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:04.624
BILLION OCCURRING HERE WILL

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:05.691
WILL HELP FACILITATE SOME OF

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:06.692
THOSE THOSE BROAD BASED

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:09.195
ECONOMIC RECOVERY- DIFFERENT

02:01:09.261 --> 02:01:13.299
PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS. THAT

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:14.500
WE'RE BUILDING TOWARDS. I DON'T

DIRECTOR NEVER THING AND- THE

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:31.917
REST OF THE TEAM- JUST AS

02:01:31.984 --> 02:01:33.352
SOMEBODY WHO'S DEALING WITH

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:36.255
MULTIPLE OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:40.893
OR- THE ANXIETY REFERRED TO IN

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.496
THE GROWING COMMUNITY. IT DOES

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:44.997
FEEL LIKE A CRISIS MAYBE IT'S

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:47.733
NOT FELT EVERYWHERE BUT I THINK

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.201
YOU KNOW GETTING READY FOR THE

02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:53.639
DEADLINES IN SIGMA IS DRIVING-

02:01:53.706 --> 02:01:55.174
A LOT OF TENSION OUT INTO

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:56.542
VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND I

02:01:56.609 --> 02:02:00.046
REALLY I JUST WANT TO. SPEND

02:02:00.112 --> 02:02:02.114
ONE SECOND IF YOU COULD. DRILL

02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:03.883
DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:06.852
HOW. CRUCIAL THESE GRANTS ARE

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:08.421
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:09.789
HOW READY THEY ARE TO DO WITH

02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:12.091
IT ALL RIGHT MY SENSE IS THAT

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:14.794
THERE'S NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT-

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.630
DELAY IN GETTING A NEW ISSUANCE

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:20.366
OF GRANTS OUT THE DOOR. AND

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.234
JUST LIKE EVEN IF IT'S A MATTER

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:24.003
OF FALLING BEHIND BY SIX MONTHS

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:27.006
WHAT WHAT COULD THAT DO I GUESS

02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:29.041

THANK YOU SELLER LEADS THAT'S A

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:36.582
GOOD QUESTION SO- I WOULD SAY

THAT- SO HOW'S MY WORKS IS AS

02:02:42.988 --> 02:02:44.924
YOU ALL KNOW- THE GROUNDWATER

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.460
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. AGENCIES

02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:51.097
NEED TO REACH SUSTAINABILITY BY

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:51.864
TWENTY FORTY AND PART OF WHAT

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:52.498
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN

02:02:52.565 --> 02:02:55.134
CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW REMEDY

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:57.837
IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.939
TIME- SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:03.142
ESSENTIALLY TAKEN DECADES- TO

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.144
CREATE AND THESE CHALLENGES OF.

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:08.247
DAMAGE FROM WATER BASINS BUT- I

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:09.515
WOULD SAY EVEN MORE THAN THAT

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:11.484
IT'S ALL IT'S ALSO CREATED SOME

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:14.353
CHALLENGES AROUND- WHAT

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.888
INFORMATION WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:16.956
GOOD CHOICES SO IF YOU CAN

02:03:17.022 --> 02:03:19.024
IMAGINE HE'S GROUNDWATER BASINS

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:22.061
REALLY IN SELECT AREAS- ONLY IN

02:03:22.128 --> 02:03:23.496
SELECT AREAS HAVE THEY BEEN

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:25.064
MANAGED AND- YOU KNOW FRANKLY

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.999
PLACES LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.734
WERE A LOT MORE AHEAD OF THE

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.302
CURVE PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE.

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.737
YOU KNOW A BROADER SET OF WATER

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:33.773
CHALLENGES SO WE SAW IT PLAY

02:03:33.839 --> 02:03:35.441
OUT WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:37.309
BASINS- AND VERY FUNCTIONAL

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:39.645
BASINS AND PARTS OF SOUTHERN

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.747
CALIFORNIA BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:45.117
LACK OF MANAGEMENT OF

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:45.718
GROUNDWATER BASINS THROUGHOUT

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:47.186
THE STATE. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.822
THE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:51.457
TO FULLY SUPPORT HOW WE'RE

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:54.260
GONNA GET FROM TWENTY TWENTY

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:55.995
ONE TO TWENTY FORTY- TO

02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:59.431
SUSTAINABLE- SUSTAINABLE

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:01.233
GROUNDWATER BASINS SO PART OF

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.635
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.703
GRANT PROGRAM IS INVESTMENTS

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:07.506
THAT. THESE LOCAL AGENCIES NEED

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:09.041
TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW FOR

02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:09.842
EXAMPLE DRILLING MORE

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:11.811
MONITORING WELLS THAT CAN HELP

02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:13.946
THEM UNDERSTAND HOW WATER IS

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:14.914
MOVING THROUGH DIFFERENT

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.050
LAYERS- WITHIN- THEIR

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.820
PARTICULAR- BASINS GEOLOGY.

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:22.988
THAT IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:26.559
FOR- HOW ABOUT SIGMA IT WORKS

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:29.061
TOGETHER WITH- THE WATER BOARD

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:31.030
AND THE SAFER PROGRAM TO ENSURE

02:04:31.096 --> 02:04:33.799
THAT WERE- USING OUR DOLLARS

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:34.733
THAT DEAL WITH DRINKING WATER

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:38.337
QUALITY. I'M IN WAYS THAT- ARE

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:41.340
COMPLEMENTARY TO- PROJECTS AND

02:04:41.407 --> 02:04:42.474
PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.043
IMPLEMENTED UNDER SICK MIND WE

02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:46.679
ARE NOT INADVERTENTLY. THROUGH

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.214
IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA.

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.748
DEEPENING WATER QUALITY

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:52.985
CHALLENGES AND- AND- THEN

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:54.787
AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:04:54.854 --> 02:04:56.622
THAT KIND OF SAFER PROGRAM SO I

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:58.224
THINK- YOU KNOW THE MORE

02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:00.292
INFORMATION. THAT WE CAN GET

02:05:00.359 --> 02:05:03.095
THE SOONER THE BETTER- IS GOING

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.164
TO GET US ON AN IMPLEMENTATION

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:07.066
TRACK FOR SIGMA- EVEN THOUGH

02:05:07.132 --> 02:05:08.334
THESE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.003
TAKE AWHILE- THEY TAKE AWHILE

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.605
BUT- THE SOONER WE HAVE BETTER

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:15.441
INFORMATION. THAT HELPS US-

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:18.377
GUIDING FUTURE INVESTMENTS- THE

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:19.845
BETTER OFF WE'LL BE HITTING

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:21.947
THAT TWENTY FORTY GOAL. SCORER

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:27.820
AND REQUIREMENT ACTUALLY. MORE

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:28.387
THAN A GOAL A REQUIREMENT.

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:29.989
THANKS THANKS FOR THE CALL. I

02:05:30.055 --> 02:05:30.990
GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT GOT

02:05:31.056 --> 02:05:32.124
THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.226
MANAGEMENT PLAN THEY'LL GET THE

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:35.895
SAFE DRINKING WATER PLANT AND

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:38.030
IN A LOT OF US MIX THEM ALL

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:39.398
TOGETHER SOME PEOPLE MAY MAKE

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:41.433
SOME WITH A- HIGH CARBON

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.768
REDUCTION PROGRAM BUT I'LL PUT

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:44.403
THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND CAN YOU

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:47.039
GIVE US SOME IDEA OF HOW THAT

02:05:47.106 --> 02:05:48.741
INTERPLAY IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:49.909
SOME PEOPLE WOULD OBSERVE WE

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.343
SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON SAFE

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:53.112
DRINKING WATER AND NOW. THE

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:53.979
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:57.917
MANAGEMENT PLAN HAD IS WORTH

02:05:57.983 --> 02:06:00.019
THE LINKAGE. GREAT QUESTION SO

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:00.953
THE DEPARTMENT IS THIS IS

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:02.821
PROBABLY THE AREA IN WHICH THE

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:05.925
DEPARTMENT IS- WORKING MOST

02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:08.227
INTENSIVELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:11.297
AT THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:13.165
BOARD- SO. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE-

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:16.568
WE HAVE GROUNDWATER BASINS- WE

02:06:16.635 --> 02:06:20.906
HAVE- A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT-

02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:23.242
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WELLS.

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:26.612
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WELLS ARE-

02:06:26.679 --> 02:06:27.913
OPERABLE VERSES IN OPERABLE AND

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:29.615
THAT THAT IS RELATIVELY NEW

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:32.051
INFORMATION RIGHT SO. PEOPLE

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:33.319
ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:34.687
COUNTIES WEREN'T REQUIRED TO

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:35.854
REPORT THAT TO THE STATE BUT WE

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:38.524
NOW HAVE. AS OF I THINK ABOUT

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.459
TWO YEARS AGO WE NOW HAVE THIS.

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.760
REALLY SIGNIFICANT PUBLICLY

02:06:41.827 --> 02:06:43.963
ACCESSIBLE- INFORMATION

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:47.266
DATABASE ABOUT- HOW MANY WELLS

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:51.203
WE HAVE. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE.

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.738
STATEWIDE IN FOR AROUND IS

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:53.639
WHICH OF THOSE WELLS ARE

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:55.274
ACTUALLY OPERABLE AND

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:57.443
FUNCTIONING AND PROVIDING AND

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.945
DOMESTIC WELL SOURCE SO- WHEN

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:02.314
WE DRINK. L. DOWN A LITTLE BIT

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:04.316
DEEPER ON INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND

02:07:04.383 --> 02:07:05.985
COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES

02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:08.420
AT THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:10.823
BOARD AND THEIR REGIONAL BOARDS

02:07:10.889 --> 02:07:11.957
BECAUSE OF COURSE THOSE PLAY AN

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:14.493
IMPORTANT ROLE IN LOCAL BASE

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.462
AND WATER QUALITY-

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:19.264
REQUIREMENTS. WE LOOK TOGETHER

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:20.199
AT THE INFORMATION THAT'S

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:21.633
AVAILABLE WHAT DOES THIS

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:25.204
INFORMATION TELL US ABOUT- THE

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.238
POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:28.273
IMPLEMENTING THIS SUSTAINABLE

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.642
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:32.277
WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DO

02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:34.380
WE NEED- FROM THE GROUNDWATER

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:36.782
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY TO ASSURE

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:39.385
HER. THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING

02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:40.919
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.055
WATER QUALITY REALM THAT YOU

02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:44.790
KNOW THE STATE IS WORKING TO

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:47.659
FUND- IN OTHER WAYS AND THAT

02:07:47.726 --> 02:07:51.096
ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT-

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:54.166
ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT-

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:55.034
WHAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:56.235
IMPORTANT ABOUT SIGMA IS

02:07:56.301 --> 02:07:58.370
ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:00.706
SO WE HAVE OPTIONS UNDER THE

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.875
LAW TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE THREE

02:08:02.941 --> 02:08:04.877
KINDS OF DECISIONS ONE. YOU CAN

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:06.478
HAVE A PLAN THAT IS WE

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:08.347
DETERMINE IS ADEQUATE WITH

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:11.083
RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.453
AND THEN- THOSE ARE GROUNDWATER

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.655
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES NEED TO

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.657
SUPPORT ANNUAL UPDATES AS TO

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:20.359
HOW THEY'RE DOING BUT THE

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:22.528
DEPARTMENT IN FIVE YEARS WILL

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:24.229
ESSENTIALLY REEVALUATE WHETHER

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.431
OR NOT THAT PLAN IS STILL

02:08:25.497 --> 02:08:27.533
ADEQUATE SO THAT'S ONE DECISION

02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:29.601
THAT WE CAN MAKE AROUND PLANTS.

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.070
THE SECOND DECISION AS WE CAN

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:34.206
SAY THAT PLAN IS INCOMPLETE AND

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:36.008
BY LAW THAT YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS

02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:38.143
A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO MAKE

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:40.546
IT COMPLETE SO IF WE LOOK AT

02:08:40.612 --> 02:08:41.747
THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:43.482
PLANS AND WE SAY WELL THEY'RE

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:45.117
MISSING SOME YOU KNOW

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:46.085
FUNDAMENTAL PIECES OF

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:48.120
INFORMATION OR- THAT

02:08:48.187 --> 02:08:49.488
INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:52.024
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH OF

02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:53.926
A PLAN AS TO HOW AND WHEN

02:08:53.992 --> 02:08:55.160
THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT YOU

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.329
KNOW PARTICULARLY RELATED TO-

02:08:57.396 --> 02:08:59.898
DRINKING WATER WELLS WE CAN

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:01.967
REQUIRE THAT BRUH- A

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:04.103
DETERMINATION THAT A PLAN IS

02:09:04.169 --> 02:09:05.537
INCOMPLETE AND THAT WOULD

02:09:05.604 --> 02:09:06.538
COMPEL THOSE GROUNDWATER

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:08.006
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:09.842
ADDRESS THAT WITHIN A SIX MONTH

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:11.477
PERIOD. THE OTHER THING THAT WE

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:13.112
CAN DO IS DETERMINE A PLAN TO

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:14.913
BE INADEQUATE AND THAT'S WHEN

02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.615
THAT PLAN THEN GOES OVER TO THE

02:09:16.682 --> 02:09:18.717
WATER BOARD- AND THEY HAVE A

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:20.752
VERY FORMAL PROCEDURE ABOUT

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:23.155
PUTTING- I PLAN ON PROBATION

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:25.357
AND THAT- EMPOWERS THE BOARD

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:27.292
SHOULD ESSENTIALLY INSTITUTE

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:29.128
INTERIM GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:32.064
MEASURES WHILE THAT-

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:33.365
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:35.134
AGENCY IS PUTTING TOGETHER A

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.236
PLAN. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:39.538
THE LAW SO WE HAVE ALL THOSE

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:42.474
KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:43.575
YOUR INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:45.644
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE RELATING

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:48.547
TO- GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND HOW

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.916
THAT'S RELATING TO- PROGRAM

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.384
MANAGEMENT OVER AT THE WATER

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:57.556
BOARD. WITH THOSE SAFER DOLLARS

02:09:57.623 --> 02:09:59.391
AND- I WOULD SAY DO YOU HAVE

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.125
YOUR IS WORKING VERY WELL THE

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:00.859
STATE LEVEL WITH THE WATER

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:02.027
BOARD AND AT THE LEADERSHIP

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:04.496
LEVEL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:10:04.563 --> 02:10:06.865
IMPORTANCE OF- OF THOSE

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:09.301
PROGRAMS HAVING INDEPENDENT-

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:11.870
CREDIBILITY- FOR THE FOR THE

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:14.139
PUBLIC AND FOR YOU ALL I KNOW

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:15.941
THAT THAT WAS A TOPIC OF GREAT

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:17.709
IMPORTANCE TO SENATOR MINING

02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:19.878
AND- AND WE ARE WORKING VERY

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:22.347
DILIGENTLY TO ARTICULATE HOW

02:10:22.414 --> 02:10:24.049
THESE PIECES MOVE TOGETHER.

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.150
YEAH AND JUST FOR THE

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.251
REPUBLICAN ALWAYS HAD AND

02:10:26.318 --> 02:10:27.653
THAT'S ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:28.554
COVERED THESE ARE ONLY THE

02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.289
AGENCY'S RECOVER BECAUSE IF YOU

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:32.591
HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL OR TWO OR

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:33.825
THREE THAT ARE ON ONE WELL

02:10:33.892 --> 02:10:35.694
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:36.762
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE

02:10:36.828 --> 02:10:38.564
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.132
IT MAY BE A CAMPGROUND OR MAYBE

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:42.000
SOMETHING THAT HAS AN ACTUAL

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:45.270
WATER DISTRICT THAT'S BEFORE US

02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:48.207
SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. N. AS

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:51.410
THUNDERSTORMS. GIVEN A FOLLOW

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.345
UP QUESTION IT JUST FOR ONE

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:55.113
LAST FALL QUESTIONS ACTUALLY.

02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:59.551
RELATED BUT. THIS IS MORE

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:02.955
ABOUT- LESS ABOUT SIGMA MORE

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:05.524
BAD IMPLEMENTATION OF A- ON THE

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:07.426
RESIDENTIAL SIDE ON A WATER YOU

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:09.595
STUDY THAT I THINK PENDING WITH

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:12.030
YOU ALL JUST- AND DOESN'T HAVE

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.799
TO BE RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW BUT

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:15.767
A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.169
IMPLEMENTATION WONDERING.

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.337
STATUS THAT REPORT TO THE

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:20.305
LEGISLATURE WE JUST GET SOME

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:22.074
INFO BACK ON THAT AT SOME POINT

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:22.674
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:25.877
DAY. SO THAT IS- WATER USE

02:11:25.944 --> 02:11:29.147
EFFICIENCY AND- D. W. R. AND

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:30.449
THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:32.017
BOARD ARE DUE TO PRESENT OUR

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:33.352

LEGISLATURE ON AN INDOOR WATER

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:38.890
USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS- AND-

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:42.094
WE ARE- LOOKING TO DO THAT BY

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.329
APRIL. I THINK. TO BE CANDID I

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:46.365
THINK THE DEADLINE WAS- END OF

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:48.166
LAST YEAR YOU NOT MEET THAT

02:11:48.233 --> 02:11:49.368
DEADLINE BUT IT IS A JOINT

THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD ITEM

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.459
NUMBER THIRTY TWO IN LESS BUT

02:12:14.526 --> 02:12:16.028
MOVED TO THE LAST ISSUE THAT WE

02:12:16.094 --> 02:12:17.763
HAVE ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY TWO

WILD FIRE PREVENTION RESILIENCY

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:24.569
EARLY ACTION PLAN. I WOULD

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- CALIFORNIA'S

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.725
RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SOME OF

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:48.160
THE LARGEST AND MOST SEVERE

02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:50.862
WILDFIRES IN RECORD HISTORY

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:53.165
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN SOME BEER BUT

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.433
HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:56.201

02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:01.273
VULNERABLE THE SUBCOMMITTEE

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.575
PROPOSES AN EARLY ACTION PLAN

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:05.644
FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND

SUNDAY. AND I WAS REACHING OUT

02:29:45.543 --> 02:29:47.611
TO ME TO. SEE WHAT MY THOUGHTS

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:49.413
WERE ON. THIS PROCESS AND

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:51.415
BEING- I GUESS A FRESHMAN ON

02:29:51.482 --> 02:29:53.617
THIS COMMITTEE- AND TRYING TO

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:55.019
FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS IS A

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:57.254
LITTLE DIFFERENT IN. MY TIME IN

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:58.723
THE ASSEMBLY. BUT I DID NOTICE

02:29:58.789 --> 02:30:00.658
SOME JUST JACKIE RIGHT NOW I

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:02.526
NOTICED ON WHERE THERE'S THIRTY

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:04.962
NINE MILLION WAS. IN SIXTEEN

02:30:05.029 --> 02:30:05.996
MILLION FOR THE DEMONSTRATION

02:30:06.063 --> 02:30:06.797
PROJECTS IN THE UPPER

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:08.833
WATERSHEDS WITH EMPHASIS ON

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:10.701
WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY COMBO

02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:12.670
OF TREATMENT STRATEGIES WELL

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:14.171
MONITORING SYSTEMS CAPTURED IT

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:15.740
IT THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:18.042
BOTTOM THAT PARAGRAPH. ON THESE

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:19.510
PROJECTS ARE IN THE NORTH COAST

02:30:19.577 --> 02:30:21.479
SOUTHERN SIERRA SAMBAR NINO

02:30:21.545 --> 02:30:22.646
NATIONAL FOREST IN THE CENTRAL

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:24.515
COAST WHICH EXCLUDES THE

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:26.384
NORTHERN. PART OF THE

02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:27.451
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.587
WHICH 60% OF OUR WATER COMES

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:31.856
FROM SO I WAS WONDERING- HOW

02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:33.724
THAT MONEY WHY WOULD NOT BE

02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:36.227
DISTRIBUTED AS WELL TO- THAT

02:30:36.293 --> 02:30:38.829
NORTHERN SIERRA'S. IF THAT'S

02:30:38.896 --> 02:30:39.330
THE CASE THEN THAT'S AN

02:30:39.397 --> 02:30:41.532
OVERSIGHT ON MY PART BY MY PART

02:30:41.599 --> 02:30:43.367
BUT THAT WAS NOT TO IT WAS NOT

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:44.835
TO EXCLUDE THEM AT ALL THIS IS

02:30:44.902 --> 02:30:46.370
JUST WHERE THE NEED IS WE

02:30:46.437 --> 02:30:49.073
UNDERSTAND. THAT THESE UPPER

02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:50.408
WATERSHEDS IS WHERE THE WORK

02:30:50.474 --> 02:30:52.376
HAS TO BE DONE SO THAT THANK

02:30:52.443 --> 02:30:54.345
YOU FOR SPOTTING THAT AND- AS

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:55.246
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WOULD

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:56.547
BE CORRECT OKAY. AND THEN THE

02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:57.782
OTHER THING I DO IS I JUST HAVE

02:30:57.848 --> 02:30:59.717
SOME GENERAL COMMENTS I WANT TO

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:01.585
MAKE THAT- SENATOR MCGUIRE.

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:03.154
ALLUDED TO NIGHT AND I WILL

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:05.389
NOT. GIVE UP ON THIS- BECAUSE I

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:08.092
THINK IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. IN

02:31:08.159 --> 02:31:12.129
OUR QUEST FOR- FIXING THE

02:31:12.196 --> 02:31:14.231
ALMOST A HUNDRED YEAR PROBLEM

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:16.434
WE CREATED THE- IN THE END I

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:17.668
WILL SAY NOT ALL IN THE

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:19.270
GRASSLANDS AND SOME OF THE

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:20.838
LOWER ELEVATIONS BUT IN THE

02:31:20.905 --> 02:31:23.908
UPPER WATERSHEDS- SUPPRESSING

02:31:23.974 --> 02:31:25.910
FIRE. WHICH NATURALLY OCCURRED

02:31:25.976 --> 02:31:28.179
WAS WRONG AND THAT WAS DONE BY

02:31:28.245 --> 02:31:32.049
US- WE DIDN'T ALLOW FIRE TO DO.

02:31:32.116 --> 02:31:34.185
WHAT IT ACTUALLY DIDWHICH WAS

02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:34.685
BURNED AND TAKE OUT THE

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:36.954
UNDERBRUSH AND SO. AS A AS MANY

02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:38.088
MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:31:38.155 --> 02:31:39.623
MANY IN THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT

02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:42.960
I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR- DOING THE

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:45.229
RIGHT THING AND I AND I.

02:31:45.296 --> 02:31:47.264
MENTIONED EARLIER IN OUR LAST

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:49.834
SET TO ABOUT. MY FRUSTRATION

02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:53.204
WITH NOT COUNTING CARBON- IN

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:54.772
WILDFIRE AND I GOT A RESPONSE

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:56.574
BACK ACTUALLY- MY STAFF ON A

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.008
RESPONSE FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:31:58.075 --> 02:32:01.212
RESOURCES BOARD. WHICH WAS FOR

02:32:01.278 --> 02:32:02.413
FIVE PAGES OF YOU KNOW THE

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:03.714
CARBON CYCLE AND HOW IT WORKS

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:04.949
IN THE WATERSHED I ALREADY

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.784
UNDERSTAND THAT CARBON CYCLE

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:09.153
AND THAT WHAT THEIR QUALIFYING

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:11.088
IS WORKING LANDSCAPES AND- SO

02:32:11.155 --> 02:32:12.389
ON AND SO FORTH. BUT AT THE END

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:14.258
OF THE DAY THE REASON I PUSHED

02:32:14.325 --> 02:32:18.162
REALLY HARD FOR. US TO. FORCE

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:20.531
THE AIR BOARD TO QUANTIFY THE

02:32:20.598 --> 02:32:23.334
CARBON OUTPUT FROM FIRE IS

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:26.003
BECAUSE 60% OF THE LAND IN

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:27.738
CALIFORNIA IS MANAGED BY OUR

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:30.407
FEDERAL PARTNER. THEY'RE NOT AT

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:32.176
THE TABLE I'M SORRY THEY THEY

02:32:32.243 --> 02:32:33.711
HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS IF MANY

02:32:33.777 --> 02:32:36.146
WERE AWARE OF. THAT DOESN'T

02:32:36.213 --> 02:32:39.250
INCLUDE. A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

02:32:39.316 --> 02:32:41.519
WILDFIRE WE'RE FRONTING THE

02:32:41.585 --> 02:32:43.654
BILL QUITE FRANKLY. ON OUR

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:45.956
ECONOMY. TO REDUCE CARBON IN

02:32:46.023 --> 02:32:47.591
CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THROUGH

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:50.094
MAINLY TRANSPORTATION AND LOT

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:50.694
OF REGULATION ON OUR BUSINESS

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:52.863
IS. WHICH I HAVE SOME ISSUE

02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:54.865
WITH ON LOT OF THOSE ISSUES ON

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:56.233
HOW WE GET WHERE WE'RE GOING WE

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:58.135
DIDN'T GET INTO. THIS PROBLEM

02:32:58.202 --> 02:32:59.169
OVERNIGHT AND WE'RE NOT GOING

02:32:59.236 --> 02:33:00.604
TO GET OUT OF IT OVERNIGHT

02:33:00.671 --> 02:33:01.238
BECAUSE IT WAS A HUNDRED YOUR

02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:04.942
PROBLEM. THAT WE STARTED SO. I

02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:06.577
WANT TO ADD HOW DID WE SAY THAT

02:33:06.644 --> 02:33:08.112
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:09.046
WERE IF WE WERE TO CARRY OUT

02:33:09.113 --> 02:33:11.181
THE CARBON. AND WE COULD TARGET

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:13.050
WHERE IT COMES FROM. FROM

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:14.718
FOREST FIRE. WE COULD THEN GO

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:16.754
TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND SAY

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.188
HEY YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH US.

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:20.224
BECAUSE ALL THE GAMES THAT WERE

02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:22.359
MAKING. ON THE TRANSPORTATION

02:33:22.426 --> 02:33:25.663
SIDE IS BEING EIGHT UP BY OUR

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:28.732
RELEASES ON THE- ON THE FOREST

02:33:28.799 --> 02:33:31.135
FIRE SIDE. AND THE CARCINOGENS

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:32.570
THAT ARE PUT OUT IN THESE FIRES

02:33:32.636 --> 02:33:36.073
ARE NOT JUST WOULD SMOKE IT'S

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:36.640
ONE WEEK HOW MANY HOMES WERE

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:37.808
BURNED UP AND HOW MUCH.

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:39.209
CARCINOGENS WERE PUT OUT IN

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:41.679
THOSE TYPES IT IS A SITUATION

02:33:41.745 --> 02:33:43.781
SO WE NEED TO QUANTIFY THAT AND

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:45.683
WE NEED THE AIR BOARD TO DO IT.

02:33:45.749 --> 02:33:46.617
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY

02:33:46.684 --> 02:33:49.186
CLEAR TO THE SENATORS AND THE

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:50.120
PUBLIC THAT ARE WATCHING THIS

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:51.589
THAT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:52.823
IF WE DON'T DO THAT AND WE

02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:55.392
DON'T HOLD THE FEDERAL

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:56.527
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.529
THEY PARTICIPATED IN. FIRE

02:33:58.596 --> 02:33:59.964
SUPPRESSION AS WELL AS

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:02.466
CALIFORNIA DID. AND THEY NEED

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:03.033
TO BE AT THE TABLE AND THEY

02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:04.902

FICTION ON A WATERSHED

02:34:06.003 --> 02:34:08.739
APPROACH. SO THE LAST THING I

02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:11.008
WANT TO MENTION TO IS THAT. THE

02:34:11.075 --> 02:34:12.309
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE

02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:14.745
NEED N. SEQUESTERING CARBON

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.714
THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:17.481
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:20.351
USING. WE HAVE. A VERY LIMITED

02:34:20.417 --> 02:34:21.952
AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:23.887
CALIFORNIA AND NONE OF THESE

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:24.755
NONE OF THAT NOT VERY MUCH OF

02:34:24.822 --> 02:34:28.092
THIS. ALL OF OUR OF OUR

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.860
BUDGETING PROCESS GOES TO.

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:30.361
FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN

02:34:30.427 --> 02:34:32.997
INCENTIVIZE. PRIVATE INVESTORS

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:35.299
TO COME ALONG SIDE US AND HELP

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:37.568
REDUCE THE COST REMEMBER IF

02:34:37.635 --> 02:34:39.870
YOU'RE TAKING. A PRODUCT OUT OF

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.605
THE FOREST IT'S USABLE IT'S

02:34:41.672 --> 02:34:43.407
THERE'S A VALUE TO THAT IN IN

02:34:43.474 --> 02:34:44.942
IN NOT VALUE REDUCES THE COST

02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:46.577
WE CAN TREAT MORE ACRES RIGHT

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:49.380

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:01.425
TRYING TO HOLD THEIR FEET TO

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.260
THE FIRE BY DOING LEGISLATION

02:35:03.327 --> 02:35:05.663

PUT OUT THE FIRE THAT'S BURNING

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:27.751
IMMEDIATELY. THE OTHER HALF OF

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:30.688
THAT IS DOING. THE VEGETATION

02:35:30.754 --> 02:35:33.657
