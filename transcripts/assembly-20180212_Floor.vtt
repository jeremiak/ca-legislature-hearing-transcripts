IN EIGHTEEN OH NINE IN KENTUCKY.

00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:09.767 region:rollup2
AND.

00:51:07.598 --> 00:51:09.767 region:rollup2
I HAVE SOMETIMES WERE ASK

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:12.069 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTIONS FROM SCHOOL

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:14.004 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE FROM OTHERS WHO SAY

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:15.773 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE TO SPEND TIME IN

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:17.374 region:rollup2
HISTORY. OR TIME WITH ANYONE IN

00:51:15.773 --> 00:51:19.476 region:rollup2
HISTORY MAYBE THREE PEOPLE WHO

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:20.945 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT BE A MY LIST AS LONG

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:23.080 region:rollup2
AS I'M SURE YEARS MAYBE AS WELL

00:51:20.945 --> 00:51:24.548 region:rollup2

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.017 region:rollup2
THAT LIST.

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:27.685 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.252 region:rollup2
NOT ALL BECAUSE OF THE

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:29.954 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PATTY HAD HONOR

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:31.655 region:rollup2
HISTORY BUT I THINK YOU'LL BE SO

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:33.691 region:rollup2
FASCINATING TO HAVE KNOWN.

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:35.292 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PRESIDENT'S PERSONALITY

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:36.827 region:rollup2
WAS TRULY LIKE WHAT HIS DEMEANOR

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.428 region:rollup2
WAS HIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:39.463 region:rollup2
ONE ON ONE IN PERSON WHICH WE

00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:40.564 region:rollup2
WE.

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:42.366 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T AND WILL NEVER HAVE A

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:43.167 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE.

00:51:42.366 --> 00:51:45.002 region:rollup2
AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WE MAY HAVE

00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:47.271 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATED HIS GREATNESS IN

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:48.339 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW NICE A PERSON HE

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:50.240 region:rollup2
WAS HOW GIVING AND WHAT A GREAT

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:51.308 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATOR.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.678 region:rollup2
BUT ONE THING YOU CAN NOT

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:56.413 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATE IS THE IMPACT HE HAD

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:58.582 region:rollup2
ON THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY.

00:51:56.413 --> 00:52:02.486 region:rollup2

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:05.956 region:rollup2
AND WE SAW THAT THROUGH ONE OF

00:52:04.355 --> 00:52:07.624 region:rollup2
HIS GREAT TRAITS WHICH IS

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:08.993 region:rollup2

AND DETERMINATION TO KEEP OUR

00:52:08.993 --> 00:52:12.730 region:rollup2
UNION TOGETHER.

00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:15.132 region:rollup2
WE HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CUT

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.233 region:rollup2

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.635 region:rollup2

AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:23.240 region:rollup2
GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.

00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:25.242 region:rollup2
RE ASK THE QUESTION IS A COUNTRY

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.944 region:rollup2
THAT'S CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.712 region:rollup2

HISTORY.

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:34.752 region:rollup2
ARE WE ABLE TO HAVE A COUNTRY

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:35.786 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT OR DO WE NEED TO

00:52:34.752 --> 00:52:37.321 region:rollup2
REVERT BACK TO THE WAY IT USED

00:52:35.786 --> 00:52:37.988 region:rollup2

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND

00:52:50.701 --> 00:52:54.304 region:rollup2
THANKFULLY HE DID THAT BECAUSE

00:52:52.236 --> 00:52:56.373 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM

IS HERE FOR MANY PEOPLE HAVE AN

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:59.543 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE ON YOU BUT I THINK

00:52:57.975 --> 00:53:02.212 region:rollup2
ALSO BECAUSE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:03.247 region:rollup2
THAT. AND PRESERVED OUR UNION.

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:05.516 region:rollup2
AND ALSO OF COURSE HE WAS

00:53:03.247 --> 00:53:07.718 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY OBSTINATE IN FIGHTING

00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:09.219 region:rollup2
TO END SLAVERY AND PASSED THE

00:53:07.718 --> 00:53:10.888 region:rollup2
THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT.

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:13.791 region:rollup2
HE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:16.060 region:rollup2
HISTORY TO HAVE PEACE WITH THE

00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:17.528 region:rollup2
SOUTH WITHOUT PASSING THE

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.962 region:rollup2

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:21.165 region:rollup2
SLAVERY AND ALL FORMS OF

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:22.666 region:rollup2
INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE.

00:53:21.165 --> 00:53:24.234 region:rollup2
HE COULD HAVE AGAIN CUT AND RUN.

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.502 region:rollup2
HE COULD HAVE SAID NO THAT'S NOT

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:27.004 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT I JUST WANNA KEEP THE

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:29.673 region:rollup2
UNION TOGETHER BUT HE WAS

00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:31.175 region:rollup2
DETERMINED TO END SLAVERY. SO

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:32.643 region:rollup2
MUCH SO THAT HE HAD AN AMENDMENT

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:34.244 region:rollup2
TO THE CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS

00:53:32.643 --> 00:53:35.379 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO AMENDMENTS

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.914 region:rollup2
HE THOUGHT THE CONSTITUTION IS

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:38.882 region:rollup2
FINE THE WAY IT WAS.

00:53:36.914 --> 00:53:40.350 region:rollup2

KEEPING OUR UNION TOGETHER AND

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.863 region:rollup2
FIGHTING TO END SLAVERY.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.264 region:rollup2
.

00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:55.365 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT IN ONE

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:57.434 region:rollup2
QUOTE THAT IS PARTICULARLY

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.968 region:rollup2
FAMOUS FOR WHICH IS BE SURE YOU

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.003 region:rollup2
PUT YOUR FEET IN THE RIGHT

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.338 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:03.407 region:rollup2
AND STAND FIRM.

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:04.641 region:rollup2
DON'T GIVE UP.

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.677 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:08.145 region:rollup2
ABOUT LINCOLN I THINK.

00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:11.448 region:rollup2
IS THAT HE WAS JUST AS COMMITTED

00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:13.417 region:rollup2
TO RECONCILIATION. AND HEALING

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:15.018 region:rollup2
AND GRACE AFTER YOU HAD FOUGHT

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:17.621 region:rollup2
THAT BATTLE FIRMLY KEPT YOUR

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:18.956 region:rollup2
FEET FIRM AND DEFEATED SOMEONE.

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:20.758 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:22.693 region:rollup2
SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:24.194 region:rollup2
WHERE HE ACTUALLY SAYS WITH

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:26.263 region:rollup2
MALICE TOWARDS NINE AND CHARITY

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:28.298 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ALL WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:29.867 region:rollup2
CARE OF THE CONFEDERATE WIDOW?

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:31.335 region:rollup2
WHOSE WHOSE HUSBAND OR WHO

00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:33.003 region:rollup2
SIGNED FOUGHT TO KILL UNION

00:54:31.335 --> 00:54:34.872 region:rollup2
SOLDIERS.

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:36.540 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY GRACE

00:54:34.872 --> 00:54:38.041 region:rollup2
AND LEADERSHIP.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2
AND THIS WASN'T JUST SOMETHING

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:42.746 region:rollup2
THAT HE. WAS SUGGESTING WE DO.

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:44.414 region:rollup2
WHEN.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:46.016 region:rollup2
WHERE PERSONALLY SLIGHTED WHICH

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:47.351 region:rollup2
OFTEN HAPPENS IN POLITICS

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:48.886 region:rollup2
AND IT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING

00:54:47.351 --> 00:54:50.754 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A A PRIVATE?

00:54:48.886 --> 00:54:52.356 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO RECONCILE AND

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:53.791 region:rollup2
HAVE GRACE TOWARD SOMEONE ELSE

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:55.192 region:rollup2
HE WAS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN IN

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:58.061 region:rollup2
HIS SECOND INAUGURAL SUGGESTED

00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:59.863 region:rollup2
THAT WE FORGIVE AND MOVE ON.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:01.064 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY HARD TO DO YOU.

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
AND THANKFULLY HE DID BECAUSE

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:06.069 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK WE ARE ALL HERE

00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:13.110 region:rollup2
PERMISSION TO USE A PROP WITHOUT

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:14.912 region:rollup2

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:20.751 region:rollup2
WHEN I GRADUATED LAW SCHOOL.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.785 region:rollup2
HE REALLY WAS HOPING THAT IT

WOULDN'T BE A LAWYER BUT SO MUCH

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:25.189 region:rollup2

I THINK IT'S TRUE THERE'S A

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.760 region:rollup2
REASON WHY LINCOLN HAS A FAST

00:55:27.758 --> 00:55:31.295 region:rollup2

CAREENING INTO BANKRUPTCY.

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.582 region:rollup2

CITY HALL WHAT'S.

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:21.698 region:rollup2
AND A TIME TO THINK DO I JUST DO

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:23.233 region:rollup2
THE EASY THING.

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:25.135 region:rollup2
FOR SOME PEOPLE WERE VERY VOCAL.

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.702 region:rollup2

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:27.130 region:rollup2
OF GENDERS IN STEM FIELDS. AND

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:28.631 region:rollup2
WHILE IN RECENT YEARS A NUMBER

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.201 region:rollup2
FIELDS HAS INCREASED WOMEN STILL

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:32.769 region:rollup2
ONLY ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.504 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S
