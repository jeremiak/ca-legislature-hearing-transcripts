SPECIFICALLY HOW TO GO ABOUT IT

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.178 region:rollup2

01:36:56.611 --> 01:36:58.946 region:rollup2
APPEALING MARKET AND ONCE WE

A LOT A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW

01:37:20.435 --> 01:37:24.238 region:rollup2
WHEN I MEET WITH FOR INVESTORS

01:37:21.903 --> 01:37:25.673 region:rollup2
THEY SAY THAT THE MARKET HERE IS

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.342 region:rollup2
SO LARGE OBVIOUSLY IT'S SO

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:29.043 region:rollup2
DIVERSE I THINK.

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:30.578 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE THE STRENGTHS

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:32.613 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'D LIKE TO

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:34.882 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATE IN EMPHASIZE AS YOU

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:36.284 region:rollup2
GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE BETWEEN

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:38.352 region:rollup2
SEAT OF SERVICES.

01:37:36.284 --> 01:37:39.921 region:rollup2
HIGH TECH SERVICES CLEAN ENERGY

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:41.989 region:rollup2
AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY FINANCIAL

01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:43.458 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND THEN THE WHOLE

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:45.059 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE

01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:46.994 region:rollup2
CENTRE PART OF THE STATE. I MEAN

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:48.496 region:rollup2
I WOULD DARE SAY THAT UP AMONG

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:49.297 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE FIFTY U. S. STATES

01:37:48.496 --> 01:37:50.965 region:rollup2
THERE IS AND WE HAVE A VERY

01:37:49.297 --> 01:37:53.601 region:rollup2
LARGE ECONOMY.

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:55.536 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIVERSE AND

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:57.438 region:rollup2
FOR ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF SUPPLY

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:58.906 region:rollup2
CHAINS AND. THAT THERE IS A LOT

01:37:57.438 --> 01:38:00.208 region:rollup2
OF INTEREST IN COMING HERE

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:02.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE IF THEY

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:03.811 region:rollup2
SITUATED ANOTHER STATE. THEY

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:05.646 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE ADVANTAGES

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:06.981 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO ONE LOCATION AND I

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:08.216 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:10.518 region:rollup2
TRY TO ADVERTISE AND SELL AS

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:13.187 region:rollup2
MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

01:38:10.518 --> 01:38:14.222 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE THING I NOTICED AND.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:15.556 region:rollup2
I GUESS I SHOULD'VE REALIZED BY

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:17.992 region:rollup2
CAN NOTICED TO I I THOUGHT THE

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:19.894 region:rollup2
CHART IS. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:20.828 region:rollup2
HEART TRADING PARTNERS YOU KNOW

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:22.430 region:rollup2
MEXICO.

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:23.798 region:rollup2
RANKS THE TOP BUT THE REST OF

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:25.199 region:rollup2
THEM OR THE MOST THE MORE THAN

01:38:23.798 --> 01:38:26.934 region:rollup2
ASIAN COUNTRIES WHICH I THOUGHT

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:28.870 region:rollup2
WAS VERY VERY INTERESTING. SO

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:30.972 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD. SERVE PRESUME

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:32.740 region:rollup2
THAT JET THAT YOU KNOW OUR WEST

01:38:30.972 --> 01:38:33.341 region:rollup2
COAST GEOGRAPHY.

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.409 region:rollup2
PLAYS A MAJOR FACTOR SEPARATE

01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:36.811 region:rollup2
TO.

01:38:34.409 --> 01:38:37.378 region:rollup2
BEING ON THE EAST COAST AND HAVE

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.513 region:rollup2
A MAJOR TRADE WITH EUROPE IS

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:39.814 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:38:38.513 --> 01:38:42.316 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTOR SAY

01:38:39.814 --> 01:38:44.152 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VERSUS TEXAS OR.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:45.686 region:rollup2
ILLINOIS A OR FLORIDA OR SOME

01:38:44.152 --> 01:38:47.121 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACE I THINK THAT'S THAT

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:48.289 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN GEOGRAPHY IS PART OF

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:49.791 region:rollup2
THE REASON IT'S ALSO THE

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:51.392 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRIOUS CHINESE AMERICAN

CHINA THAT'S ALSO JUST BECAUSE

01:38:57.698 --> 01:39:00.535 region:rollup2
OF THE BENEFITS THAT OUR STATE

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.669 region:rollup2

OF THE BENEFITS THAT ARE STATES

01:39:12.547 --> 01:39:16.083 region:rollup2

01:53:11.218 --> 01:53:14.388 region:rollup2
TWENTY TIMES. VISIT ABOUT THIRTY

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.956 region:rollup2
CITIES.

01:53:14.388 --> 01:53:17.324 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:53:15.956 --> 01:53:18.725 region:rollup2
UNKNOWNS ABOUT OF THE UNITED

01:53:17.324 --> 01:53:20.861 region:rollup2
STATES.

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:22.462 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM

01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:23.997 region:rollup2
CALLED VIRTUAL SHELTER. I WERE

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:26.300 region:rollup2
SMALL ORGANIZATION WE CAN'T DO

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:27.601 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING. BUT WHAT WE DO IS WE

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.135 region:rollup2
WE REFER PEOPLE TO FEEL

01:53:27.601 --> 01:53:29.770 region:rollup2
CONNECTED CAN ANSWER THOSE

01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:31.104 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:32.773 region:rollup2
AND SO A LOT OF OUR WORK AND

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:35.042 region:rollup2
HEAD START OFF WITH THE EP FIVE

01:53:32.773 --> 01:53:36.410 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS

01:53:35.042 --> 01:53:37.577 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE INVESTMENT FOR FOR

01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:38.478 region:rollup2
NEW COMPANIES HERE IN THE UNITED

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:39.913 region:rollup2
STATES.

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:41.381 region:rollup2
I GOING THROUGH THE RECESSION

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:43.283 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT HE BE FIVE WAS

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:44.484 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD PROGRAM. IT SPECIALLY

01:53:43.283 --> 01:53:46.153 region:rollup2
AS THE ECONOMY IN CHINA WAS

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:47.788 region:rollup2
INCREASING.

01:53:46.153 --> 01:53:48.755 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:49.623 region:rollup2
ATTRACTING OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:50.691 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT

01:53:49.623 --> 01:53:52.225 region:rollup2
INTO IMPERIAL VALLEY WHICH IS

01:53:50.691 --> 01:53:53.827 region:rollup2
THAT THE TIME WAS VERY WERE

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:56.596 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY UNKNOWN TO CHINA.

01:53:53.827 --> 01:53:58.265 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS

01:53:56.596 --> 01:54:00.033 region:rollup2
KIND OF SHIFT.

01:53:58.265 --> 01:54:03.036 region:rollup2
IN THE IMPORTANCE OF AB FIVE IN

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:04.071 region:rollup2
AND OUR MARKETING STRATEGY WAS.

01:54:03.036 --> 01:54:05.238 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IT BE FIVE IT.

01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:07.741 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WHICH COULD OFFER

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:10.143 region:rollup2
VIS'S.

01:54:07.741 --> 01:54:11.945 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO FOR TRADES.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:12.546 region:rollup2
TODAY WE'RE MARKETING

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:15.482 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE FOREIGN TRADE

01:54:12.546 --> 01:54:17.184 region:rollup2
ZONES ó AND BY THE WAY WE ALSO

01:54:15.482 --> 01:54:18.118 region:rollup2
HAVE THE BE FIVE PROGRAM.

01:54:17.184 --> 01:54:19.586 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ST SEEN THAT SHIFT IN

01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:21.088 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY BASED UPON. WHAT

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:22.289 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST IS BY OUR CHINESE

01:54:21.088 --> 01:54:23.657 region:rollup2
CLIENTS

01:54:22.289 --> 01:54:24.191 region:rollup2
LEASES ARE STILL VERY IMPORTANT

01:54:23.657 --> 01:54:25.359 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A DIRECTION IN

01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:26.693 region:rollup2
CHINA?

01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:28.829 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE AT THE FOREIGN

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.496 region:rollup2
TRADE ZONE LEVEL. AND THAT'S

01:54:28.829 --> 01:54:30.497 region:rollup2
GOING ON AND COME BACK TO THAT

01:54:29.496 --> 01:54:35.001 region:rollup2
LATER AND TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT

01:54:30.497 --> 01:54:36.403 region:rollup2

IF I WANT TO MENTION THAT.

01:54:36.403 --> 01:54:39.039 region:rollup2

SOMETIME THE PRO COUNTY. THOSE

DELEGATIONS ARE ARE VERY

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:21.681 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND IT'S DELEGATION.

01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:23.617 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:25.352 region:rollup2
GAME THEIR INTEREST BECAUSE THE

01:55:23.617 --> 01:55:26.787 region:rollup2
FOREIGN TRADE ZONE AND THE FREE

01:55:25.352 --> 01:55:28.321 region:rollup2
TRADE ZONE RELATIONSHIP SO WE

01:55:26.787 --> 01:55:29.556 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED WITH CHINA. AND SO WE

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:30.757 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT IS

01:55:29.556 --> 01:55:31.725 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:32.859 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT

01:55:31.725 --> 01:55:34.427 region:rollup2
STRATEGY WE DO NEED HELP FROM

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:35.862 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:36.396 region:rollup2
AND THIS THE HELP THAT WE NEED

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:37.798 region:rollup2
FROM STATE IS REALLY STAKE

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:39.299 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING THAT LANGUAGE

01:55:37.798 --> 01:55:39.866 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE LEGISLATION

01:55:39.299 --> 01:55:40.967 region:rollup2
PERTAINING TO FOREIGN TRADE

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:42.169 region:rollup2
ZONES.

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:43.970 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR

01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:44.438 region:rollup2
TRADES ON THE REGULAR BAY

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.472 region:rollup2
REGULATED BY A FEDERAL

01:55:44.438 --> 01:55:46.640 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:55:45.472 --> 01:55:48.074 region:rollup2
THERE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED AT

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.242 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:50.944 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:52.312 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE.

01:55:50.944 --> 01:55:53.914 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:55.248 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FROM FROM THE STATE

01:55:53.914 --> 01:55:56.683 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THAT'S DIFFERENT

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:58.452 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENS OUR LANGUAGE THAT

01:55:56.683 --> 01:56:00.053 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES SUPPORT. VIA FOREIGN

01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:00.620 region:rollup2
TRADE ZONES HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:56:00.053 --> 01:56:02.122 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.590 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE

01:56:02.122 --> 01:56:04.858 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES

01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:07.060 region:rollup2
OF THE FREE TRADE ZONES ARE

01:56:04.858 --> 01:56:09.162 region:rollup2
REALLY ADMINISTERED. AND.

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:10.730 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THIRTY COMES FROM THE

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:11.298 region:rollup2
PROVINCIAL LEVEL SO THEY'RE

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:11.598 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOKING TO THE STATE

01:56:11.298 --> 01:56:13.467 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:56:11.598 --> 01:56:15.068 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT.

01:56:13.467 --> 01:56:17.270 region:rollup2

A RESPONSE FROM THEM RIGHT NOT

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:24.778 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WILL BE WORKING ON

01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:26.046 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:56:24.778 --> 01:56:27.380 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

01:56:26.046 --> 01:56:29.349 region:rollup2

IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PUBLIC

OFFICIALS TRAVEL TO CHINA.

01:56:37.324 --> 01:56:38.859 region:rollup2
I THINK I'VE DONE A VERY GOOD

01:56:38.158 --> 01:56:40.460 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:56:38.859 --> 01:56:42.462 region:rollup2
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.996 region:rollup2
CHINA BUT YOU CAN ONLY TAKE IT

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:43.930 region:rollup2
SO FAR AS A PRIVATE SECTOR

01:56:42.996 --> 01:56:45.999 region:rollup2
MEMBER.

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:48.535 region:rollup2
AND IN IN ORDER TO SHOW THE

01:56:45.999 --> 01:56:49.769 region:rollup2

01:56:54.074 --> 01:56:57.110 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS

01:56:55.275 --> 01:56:58.478 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BETTER.

01:56:57.110 --> 01:57:00.046 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT WERE VERY

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:00.881 region:rollup2
CAUTIOUS OF IS MAKING SURE THAT

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:02.883 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT VIOLATE THE FAIR

01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:03.516 region:rollup2

01:58:17.591 --> 01:58:21.061 region:rollup2
MARKET IN CHINA. NOT ONLY FOR

01:58:19.326 --> 01:58:23.296 region:rollup2
FORAGE CROPS BUT ALSO FROM OUR

01:58:21.061 --> 01:58:25.165 region:rollup2

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:25.799 region:rollup2
CITRUS CROPS.

01:58:25.165 --> 01:58:27.434 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:58:25.799 --> 01:58:28.868 region:rollup2
US IN THEM IN THEM CALIFORNIA IS

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:30.437 region:rollup2
OUR PORTS.

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:32.772 region:rollup2
AND THE COST OF TRANSPORTING

01:58:30.437 --> 01:58:34.207 region:rollup2
GOODS TO ASIA ESPECIALLY CHINA

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:36.142 region:rollup2
IS VERY VERY LOW.

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:38.745 region:rollup2
I WE DID A STUDY AND IT COST US

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:41.514 region:rollup2
LESS TO EXPORT. A OUR CONTAINER

01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:42.749 region:rollup2
OF ALFALFA TO CHINA.

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:44.484 region:rollup2
THEN IT DOES GO SHIPPING

CONTAINER TO FRANCE.

01:58:44.484 --> 01:58:48.355 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THAT

01:58:46.553 --> 01:58:50.523 region:rollup2
DISPARITY. AND THAT'S AN

01:58:48.355 --> 01:58:52.459 region:rollup2

SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR US AS I

02:00:10.904 --> 02:00:14.074 region:rollup2
MENTION.

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:15.942 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS THOSE ARE MAKING

02:00:14.074 --> 02:00:17.577 region:rollup2

FUTURE APPLY FOR A CITIZENSHIP

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:25.051 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES SO IT'S A

02:00:22.749 --> 02:00:26.453 region:rollup2
PATHWAY. TO CITIZENSHIP.

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:27.854 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED WHEN A SUCCESSFUL

02:00:26.453 --> 02:00:29.355 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN HELPING US TO TARGET

02:00:27.854 --> 02:00:30.924 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:32.158 region:rollup2
AND INTO THE IMPERIAL COUNTY BUT

02:00:30.924 --> 02:00:33.560 region:rollup2
I WANTED I WANT TO ADD ONE THING

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:34.461 region:rollup2
TO THAT.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.262 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH

02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:42.235 region:rollup2
REINVESTMENT BY THOSE INVESTORS.

02:00:40.467 --> 02:00:44.804 region:rollup2

INVESTOR CAN. AND IS EXPECTED TO

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:47.207 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THEIR INVESTMENT BACK

THEY HAVE TO PUT THAT MANY A

02:00:47.207 --> 02:00:50.477 region:rollup2
RISK FOR FIVE YEARS. SO AFTER

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:51.911 region:rollup2
THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHAT WE'RE

02:00:50.477 --> 02:00:53.379 region:rollup2

VIRTUAL SHELTER PROGRAM.

02:00:57.884 --> 02:01:01.755 region:rollup2

.

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:20.740 region:rollup2
CENTER REGIONAL CENTER TO HANDLE

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
I WHAT THE TAX IMPLICATE

02:01:29.883 --> 02:01:33.353 region:rollup2
IMPLICA IMPLICATIONS COULD BE

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:34.754 region:rollup2
SITE SELECTION THOSE TYPES OF

02:01:33.353 --> 02:01:36.389 region:rollup2
THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WE CAN

02:01:34.754 --> 02:01:37.257 region:rollup2
HELP THEM DO THAT. SO THAT'S

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:39.425 region:rollup2
BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THEY

02:01:37.257 --> 02:01:40.393 region:rollup2
WERE DOING WE MADE A COMMITMENT

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:42.562 region:rollup2
TO TALLA CHINA FOUR TIMES PER

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:43.663 region:rollup2
YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THAT I WE

02:01:42.562 --> 02:01:45.198 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO GO TO CHINA TO

02:01:43.663 --> 02:01:45.665 region:rollup2
GIVE THE SEMINARS WERE DOING

02:01:45.198 --> 02:01:47.767 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT A SOUTHERN

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:48.234 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:48.535 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE BEING VERY

02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:50.537 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:51.471 region:rollup2
.

02:01:50.537 --> 02:01:52.739 region:rollup2
IT FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:54.674 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TO TALK ABOUT

02:01:52.739 --> 02:01:55.975 region:rollup2
INTERNSHIPS AYE WE DEVELOPED A

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:58.011 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR INTERNSHIPS WE'VE

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:59.746 region:rollup2
HAD INTERNS. FROM A CHINESE

02:01:58.011 --> 02:02:01.447 region:rollup2
ATTENDING U. S. SCHOOLS FROM

02:01:59.746 --> 02:02:03.583 region:rollup2
UNIVERSES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:04.150 region:rollup2
IRVINE PEPPER NINE.

02:02:03.583 --> 02:02:07.287 region:rollup2
AND THE.

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:08.555 region:rollup2
A MICHIGAN STATE AND THAT'S

02:02:07.287 --> 02:02:09.856 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY HELPFUL FOR US AND

02:02:08.555 --> 02:02:11.491 region:rollup2
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:02:09.856 --> 02:02:13.126 region:rollup2
COMPANIES AND CHINA.

02:02:11.491 --> 02:02:14.661 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WE'VE CONTINUED THOSE

02:02:13.126 --> 02:02:16.963 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS AFTER THOSE

02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:18.164 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED. AND WE

02:02:16.963 --> 02:02:20.600 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A CURRENTLY HAVING

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:23.036 region:rollup2
A NEW INTERN THAT IS ATTENDING

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.437 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IN XI'AN CHINA. AND SEWER

02:02:23.036 --> 02:02:25.972 region:rollup2
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND SHE

02:02:24.437 --> 02:02:27.841 region:rollup2
IN XI'AN. AND SO I THINK THAT

02:02:25.972 --> 02:02:29.709 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND IS

02:02:27.841 --> 02:02:30.376 region:rollup2
THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:32.645 region:rollup2
TO THE CHINESE.

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:34.214 region:rollup2
I'M POPULATION AND I IT'S A

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:36.616 region:rollup2
GREAT AVENUE FOR US TO SEEK

02:02:34.214 --> 02:02:37.717 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT. AND SO ONE OF AND

02:02:36.616 --> 02:02:39.085 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:40.420 region:rollup2
DONE IS REALLY TRY TO BUILD ON

02:02:39.085 --> 02:02:41.621 region:rollup2
THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT. WE

02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:43.223 region:rollup2
BUILT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX

02:02:41.621 --> 02:02:44.257 region:rollup2
CAMPUS IN THEM PEARL COUNTY THAT

02:02:43.223 --> 02:02:46.226 region:rollup2
WAS FINANCED.

02:02:44.257 --> 02:02:47.794 region:rollup2
I'M BY INVESTORS FROM CHINA AND

02:02:46.226 --> 02:02:49.929 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FOR

02:02:47.794 --> 02:02:50.997 region:rollup2
US TO AND. I BRING INVESTMENT

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:53.733 region:rollup2
AND ALSO CONTINUE THOSE

02:02:50.997 --> 02:02:55.401 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS.

02:02:53.733 --> 02:02:55.969 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.670 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES

02:02:55.969 --> 02:02:59.973 region:rollup2
GOING ON. I'M WITH OUR

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:01.441 region:rollup2

A IT IS TRANSFORMATIONAL SO AS A

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:28.508 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN.

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:30.510 region:rollup2
OF CHINESE DESCENT.

INHERENT UNIQUE HUMAN CONNECTION

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:53.666 region:rollup2

TODAY'S ABOUT TRADE. AND

02:07:53.666 --> 02:07:56.736 region:rollup2
COMMERCE IN JOBS BUT I THINK

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:58.437 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTHWHILE TO LOOK AT THE

02:07:56.736 --> 02:07:59.906 region:rollup2
BIGGER PICTURE.

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:01.073 region:rollup2
MANY AGREE THAT ONE OF THE MOST

02:07:59.906 --> 02:08:02.608 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IF NOT THE MOST

02:08:01.073 --> 02:08:04.243 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP

02:08:02.608 --> 02:08:05.578 region:rollup2
TODAY IS THE RELATIONSHIP

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:06.846 region:rollup2
BETWEEN. THE UNITED STATES AND

CHINA.

02:08:06.846 --> 02:08:10.616 region:rollup2
NOW THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:13.619 region:rollup2
IS HEAVILY POLITICIZED.

02:08:10.616 --> 02:08:15.621 region:rollup2
AND DRAMATIC AND COMPLICATED AND

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:16.689 region:rollup2
NUANCED AND I THINK WE IN

02:08:15.621 --> 02:08:18.224 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE A UNIQUE

02:08:16.689 --> 02:08:18.724 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY OUT A WIN

02:08:18.224 --> 02:08:20.693 region:rollup2

TO THIS CONVERSATION THAT IS

02:08:22.295 --> 02:08:27.066 region:rollup2

02:08:29.302 --> 02:08:32.738 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:34.207 region:rollup2

A PROGRAM WORTH.

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:59.051 region:rollup2

ABOUT. A WORK IN PROGRESS

02:11:02.121 --> 02:11:04.824 region:rollup2

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:07.426 region:rollup2
.

02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:09.261 region:rollup2
FD I IS ONE OF THE BIG THEMES

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:11.530 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:13.199 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TRACKED. VIS VIS

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:15.634 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF OF

02:11:13.199 --> 02:11:17.536 region:rollup2
CHINA IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD SAY

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:19.038 region:rollup2
A LARGE A PLURALITY OF THOSE

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:20.639 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

02:11:19.038 --> 02:11:21.707 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN BUYOUTS.

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.508 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN CORPORATE BUYOUTS

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:24.210 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN EMANATE

02:11:22.508 --> 02:11:25.878 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS.

02:11:24.210 --> 02:11:28.948 region:rollup2
INASMUCH AS THEY DO ENJOY NEW

02:11:25.878 --> 02:11:31.150 region:rollup2
CAPITAL INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

02:11:28.948 --> 02:11:33.085 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:34.019 region:rollup2
JOB CREATION WHEN IT COMES TO

02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:34.687 region:rollup2
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:36.922 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

02:11:34.687 --> 02:11:39.592 region:rollup2
AND.

02:11:36.922 --> 02:11:41.327 region:rollup2
WE SEE MANY CHALLENGES IN REALLY

02:11:39.592 --> 02:11:43.095 region:rollup2
THE FULL ENGAGEMENT. OF THIS

02:11:41.327 --> 02:11:44.663 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:46.799 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

02:11:44.663 --> 02:11:48.567 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE WE STARTED TO LOOK AT

02:11:46.799 --> 02:11:48.968 region:rollup2
IS HOW DO YOU MAKE VIABLE AYE WE

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:50.569 region:rollup2
ASK THE QUESTION.

02:11:48.968 --> 02:11:51.971 region:rollup2
A.

02:11:50.569 --> 02:11:55.341 region:rollup2

WE BRING MORE PLAYERS TO THE

02:11:56.809 --> 02:11:59.078 region:rollup2
TABLE AND I THINK.

02:11:57.977 --> 02:12:00.312 region:rollup2
FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:02.281 region:rollup2
STARTING AT A AT AN AMAZING

02:12:00.312 --> 02:12:03.916 region:rollup2
PLACE.

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:05.885 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL THE STREET ENOUGH

02:12:03.916 --> 02:12:08.187 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:12:05.885 --> 02:12:10.423 region:rollup2

BUSINESS

02:12:16.262 --> 02:12:19.365 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY CREATES THE

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:21.267 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CHINA RELATIONSHIP.

02:12:19.365 --> 02:12:22.868 region:rollup2
AT A LEVEL THAT IS UNPARALLELED

02:12:21.267 --> 02:12:24.436 region:rollup2
BY ANY OTHER.

REGION.

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:28.574 region:rollup2
SO WOULD THIS CALIFORNIA CHINA

AND.

02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:16.889 region:rollup2
THE LATEST ENDEAVOR AND THIS IS

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:19.325 region:rollup2
NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS REALLY A

02:13:16.889 --> 02:13:21.227 region:rollup2
SHARE ITS.

02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:23.062 region:rollup2
WHICH IS CAN WE ENGAGE A

02:13:21.227 --> 02:13:24.497 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL CHINESE EQUITY UNDER

02:13:23.062 --> 02:13:25.664 region:rollup2

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:34.206 region:rollup2
OF PUT.

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:35.074 region:rollup2
AND CAN WE REALLY A LOOK AT.

02:13:34.206 --> 02:13:37.076 region:rollup2
BUT THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VERY

02:13:35.074 --> 02:13:38.110 region:rollup2
SAME ALL USE CREATED AND INVEST

02:13:37.076 --> 02:13:40.279 region:rollup2
IN ACCORDANCE.

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:42.515 region:rollup2
WHAT THESE THINGS

02:13:40.279 --> 02:13:44.283 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT?

02:13:42.515 --> 02:13:46.118 region:rollup2
FOR TO REALLY ENGAGE THE PRIVATE

02:13:44.283 --> 02:13:48.487 region:rollup2

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:50.089 region:rollup2
THE. BUSINESSES THAT ARE READY

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:51.457 region:rollup2

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:07.339 region:rollup2
GOOD WAY TO START A BUSINESS

02:14:05.905 --> 02:14:09.241 region:rollup2

02:27:19.164 --> 02:27:22.634 region:rollup2
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT DID THAT IT

02:27:21.032 --> 02:27:23.568 region:rollup2
IS. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND

02:27:22.634 --> 02:27:25.770 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS IN THOSE

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:29.574 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS HAVE TO FIRST BE.

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:31.643 region:rollup2
NURTURED AND I WAS THINKING I

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:33.244 region:rollup2
AS I I HAVE HEARD THIS

02:27:31.643 --> 02:27:34.312 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION AND AGAIN

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.613 region:rollup2
REMEMBERING.

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:37.449 region:rollup2
BEING AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:39.150 region:rollup2
TEACHER FIRST ALMOST THIRTY

02:27:37.449 --> 02:27:41.219 region:rollup2
YEARS IT'S IT'S MUCH LIKE A

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:42.921 region:rollup2
SCENE THAT YOU PLANT AND IT HAS

02:27:41.219 --> 02:27:44.823 region:rollup2
TO BE NURTURED IN AS YOU START

02:27:42.921 --> 02:27:46.991 region:rollup2
TO SEE THESE INVESTMENTS GROWING

02:27:44.823 --> 02:27:48.960 region:rollup2
GROW ON BOTH SIDES. WHETHER IT'S

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:51.596 region:rollup2
AN INVESTMENTS IN CHINA OR CHINA

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:53.231 region:rollup2
INVESTING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:55.400 region:rollup2
THAT OVER THE YEARS AND REALLY

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:57.902 region:rollup2
MANY MANY YEARS THIS.

02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:00.505 region:rollup2
BRANCHES OF GROWING IF YOU WANT

02:27:57.902 --> 02:28:03.007 region:rollup2
TO USE THE METAPHOR OF A TREE.

02:28:00.505 --> 02:28:05.643 region:rollup2
AND NOW THEY'RE NOT ONLY

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:08.279 region:rollup2
GROWING BUT WE HAVE ALMOST LIKE

02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:09.914 region:rollup2
A IT MANY MANY TREES A FARM OF

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:11.750 region:rollup2
TREES AND.

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:13.418 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:16.121 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S EDUCATIONAL

02:28:13.418 --> 02:28:17.989 region:rollup2

02:28:16.121 --> 02:28:21.226 region:rollup2
CULTURAL EXCHANGES THERE'S UP

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:22.827 region:rollup2
MANY MORE OF GROWTH THAT WE CAN

02:28:21.226 --> 02:28:24.763 region:rollup2
DO AS WE'VE SEEN THAT CALIFORNIA

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:27.232 region:rollup2
IS A VERY DIVERSE IN PLACE THAT

02:28:24.763 --> 02:28:29.334 region:rollup2
CHINA WANTS TO. INVEST IN SO

02:28:27.232 --> 02:28:31.369 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAY HAVE A FOREST OF OF

02:28:29.334 --> 02:28:33.238 region:rollup2
GROWTH BUT I DO WANNA JUST

02:28:31.369 --> 02:28:33.638 region:rollup2
REFLECT ON A FEW OF THE THINGS

02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:37.242 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:28:33.638 --> 02:28:40.378 region:rollup2
I HAVE HEARD THAT I THINK ARE

02:28:37.242 --> 02:28:42.247 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE OF THAT IN SOMETIMES

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:44.082 region:rollup2
AS A TEACHER WE LEARN AND I KNOW

02:28:42.247 --> 02:28:45.784 region:rollup2

OTHER BETTER AND DO A BETTER JOB

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:58.163 region:rollup2
AT ON OUR INVESTMENTS BUT. WAY

02:28:56.795 --> 02:29:01.232 region:rollup2
BACK FROM THE BUILDING OF THE

02:28:58.163 --> 02:29:03.601 region:rollup2
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. THAT

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:04.769 region:rollup2
IS IN FACT IN OUR CALIFORNIA

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.436 region:rollup2
HISTORY BOOKS.

02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:07.705 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:10.308 region:rollup2
YOU ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF

02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:12.911 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE NEED YOUR HELP

WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THOUGH.

02:29:12.911 --> 02:29:16.381 region:rollup2
IF THEY THINK THAT WE WANT TO

02:29:14.345 --> 02:29:18.483 region:rollup2
GET THAT MOVING FASTER BUT ALSO

02:29:16.381 --> 02:29:22.320 region:rollup2
TO THE BORDER OF MEXICO LEE AND

02:29:18.483 --> 02:29:24.722 region:rollup2
THAT HISTORY THERE. BUT EVEN NOW

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:27.525 region:rollup2
TO SEEING THAT MORE AND MORE

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:31.396 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN AMERICA ARE VALUING

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:33.498 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF KEEPING UP THE

02:29:31.396 --> 02:29:36.868 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WITH THE DUAL IMMERSION

02:29:33.498 --> 02:29:38.536 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. AND FOR A LONG PERIOD

02:29:36.868 --> 02:29:43.842 region:rollup2
WE SAW MANY OF OUR.

02:29:38.536 --> 02:29:44.876 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHETHER IT BE SPANISH

02:29:43.842 --> 02:29:45.410 region:rollup2
CHINESE OR ANY OTHER.

02:29:44.876 --> 02:29:45.944 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES OF LOSING THAT

02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:47.412 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE UP BECAUSE THERE

02:29:45.944 --> 02:29:48.780 region:rollup2
WASN'T.

02:29:47.412 --> 02:29:49.447 region:rollup2
INNOCENCE OF.

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.281 region:rollup2
THE VALUE OF THAT CULTURE AND WE

02:29:49.447 --> 02:29:50.849 region:rollup2
WOULD SEE A FAMILIES

02:29:50.281 --> 02:29:52.484 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATING AT A VERY LOW

02:29:50.849 --> 02:29:53.151 region:rollup2
LEVEL JUST WITH ONE OR TWO WORDS

02:29:52.484 --> 02:29:53.985 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EVER. ABLE

02:29:53.151 --> 02:29:55.453 region:rollup2
SO AS A TEACHER OF ALWAYS TOLD.

02:29:53.985 --> 02:29:57.589 region:rollup2
MY STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILY
