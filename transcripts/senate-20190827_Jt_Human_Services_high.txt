ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEES WILL COME TO ORDER. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RARE IT RAY IS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY. THIS HEARING FOCUSES. THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT AND HOW IT IS ADMINISTERED IN CALIPERS. AS SUCH IT SERVES TWO PURPOSES ONE TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE'S LEAD AGENCY OVERSEE SBG. WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING ON ITS DRAFT STATE PLAN FOR CS BG. AND TO IT ALSO MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE HOLD A LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON CSP G. EVERY THREE YEARS. THE SBG IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED LOCALLY DRIVEN ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS HAS ROOTS DATING BACK TO THE WAR ON POVERTY OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED ABOUT SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS UNDER THE CS BG PROGRAM. THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE DEVELOPED IN OFFERED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY NEED. LOCAL ENTITIES WERE REQUIRED TO MEET PROGRAM AND FISCAL STANDARDS ARE GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF SERVICES THEY ARE MOST NEEDED WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. CSP E. G. FUNDS AN ARRAY OF SERVICES RANGING FROM MEETING THE BASIC HUMAN NEED FOR FOOD TO MORE COMPLEX NEED. LIKE EXITING FROM OR AVOIDING HOMELESSNESS. ADDITIONALLY THE FLEXIBILITY OF CSP G. ALLOWS. ELIGIBLE ENTITIES TO BE NIMBLE DURING A CRISIS. FOR EXAMPLE CS BG FUNDS WERE USED TO RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO THE NATURAL DISASTERS THAT RECENTLY HIT CALIFORNIA. DURING WHICH THE SBG FUNDS WERE USED TO PROVIDE FOOD SHELTER AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES WELL MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE JOINING THE BENEFITS OF A THRIVING ECONOMY. POVERTY POSSESS PERSIST FOR MANY OTHERS SADLY CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THREE STATES TYPE FOR HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE COUNTRY. WE SURE THAT RANKING WITH FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA. ACCORDING TO SOME STIMATES. ALMOST TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY FIVE MILLION LIVE AT THE POVERTY LINE AND SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION ARE LIVING NEAR POVERTY. THIS MEANS FOURTEEN POINT ONE MILLION OR THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING AT OR NEAR THE POVERTY LINE. ADDITIONALLY WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. CALIFORNIA HAD THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THESE NUMBERS ARE TROUBLING AND I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF DEEP POVERTY ON OUR CHILDREN AND OUR OLDER ADULTS. THUS I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEED AND HOW THE-DEPARTMENT WORKS TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS WHILE ALSO OVERSEEING PROPER ADMINISTRATION. OF PRECIOUS FEDERAL DOLLARS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR CONTATO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS BRENDA CALLAHAN JOHNSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE MERCED COUNTY COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY. AS WELL AS THE PAST PRESIDENT OF KAPPA KAPPA THROUGH MAY OF THIS YEAR. IT IS AN HONOR TO JOIN YOU TODAY AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH OUR NAMES AREN'T THE SAME AND SOME OF US ARE PRIVATE NONPROFIT WHILE OTHERS ARE ARMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OUR MISSION IS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT POVERTY IN OUR COMMUNITIES EASING THE PLIGHT OF THE POOR AND RAISING THEM OUT OF THE RANKS OF POVERTY. BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND THE FIFTY EIGHT THE SBG ENTITY STATEWIDE. WE HAVE MADE LONG STRIDES TOWARDS HELPING THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES LIVE BETTER LIVES AND REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT CS BG ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING EVERY CORNER OF THIS HUGE STATE. CST TWO DOLLARS FOR THE FUNDS THAT BIND US THAT GUY YES AND THEY GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO EACH COMMUNITY IN A DIFFERENT WAY. MAKING OUR SERVICES MORE TARGETED AND IMPACTFUL TO THOSE THAT WE SERVE. THE FACT THAT A HUGE MAJORITY OF OUR AGENCIES HAVE BEEN IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. POINTS TO OUR FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO ADAPT TO THE EVER CHANGING FACES OF THE POOR IN OUR STATE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN COMMUNITY ACTION IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE FIVE MONTHS OUT OF COLLEGE. I TAUGHT A CLASS ON CANNING AND PRESERVING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. WE REGULARLY DISTRIBUTED WOOD IN THE WINTER. OBVIOUSLY TIMES CHANGE NOW FREED IS CHEAPER TO BUY IN THE STORE AND WOOD BURNING ISN'T OPTIMAL FOR OUR OUR AIR QUALITY. CHANGE THAT THAT SCARE US AND EXCITE SAYS. TO GIVE EXAMPLE TO WHAT WE DO ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IF NOT THE LEADERS ON THE ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS RUNNING HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO TRACK DATA ON EVERY HOMELESS PERSON RECEIVING SERVICES AND SHELTERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. THE DATA WE COLLECT GUIDES ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ON PROJECTS AND PRIORITIES WHEN DEALING WITH THEIR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. THE SBG DOLLARS GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO TRY NEW IDEAS AND EXPAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT MIGHT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO BE SO FLEXIBLE. ONE EXAMPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND SINCE BUILDING YOU SEE MORE SAD HOUSING HOUSING AVAILABILITY HAS PLUMMETED 21% AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOUSING THE HOMELESS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHEN COMPETITION FOR HOUSING IS MAINSTREAM WORKERS AND STUDENTS. WITH THE SB TWO DOLLARS WE HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN ABLE TO ADD A POSITION OF THE HOUSING ADVOCATE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LANDLORDS BUT WALK THE CUSTOMER THROUGH THE HOUSING PROCESS AND ACT AS A CONTACT FOR THE LANDLORDS YOU MAY BE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TENANTS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND STAYS THE NAVIGATION CENTERS AND SHELTERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL WAITING TO BE HOUSED. STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS HAVE STRICT LIMITS ON HOW LONG INDIVIDUALS COULD STAY IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE NEED. THE SBG ADDRESSES THAT NEED. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF CS BG BUT OTHER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE COULD FILL YOUR DAYS WITH SIMILAR STORIES OF HOW ESSENTIAL CFE GS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. MOST RECENTLY MANY OF THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES AND SPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE STATE BY OUT WORKERS. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THE SBG DOLLARS TO PROVIDE MEANING LOCATIONS OFFICE EQUIPMENT. MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AND CONTACT POINTS FOR IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICES. INCLUDING DOCTOR RE CERTIFICATIONS AND FINES FOR PEOPLE TO RECERTIFY. A SERVICE THAT WAS NOT NEEDED AND ON OUR COMMUNITY AS EARLY AS THREE YEARS AGO. CHANGE CAME QUICKLY AND WE ADOPTED. THE SBG FUNDED AGENCY SERVED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES LAST YEAR AND INSERTED OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AND A CALIFORNIA THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE FUNDERS FEDERAL DOLLARS I LEVERAGING OF EITHER SEE SB G. RESOURCES. THE F. B. G. AS THE SEED MONEY THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE ONE DOLLAR AND TEN NINE DOLLARS THROUGH COLLABORATION INNOVATION AND A TRUE BELIEF THAT WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER FOR THOSE IN NEED. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF CS BG NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT IN YOUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP. FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ALL. START WITH OUR OUR- CULTURE HERE. YES. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I'VE SEEN THROUGH YOU NEVER HEARING THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THEY'RE GREAT PROGRAMS BUT THE OUTREACH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT KELLY I TO SEE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BUT IF THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER THE MONEY IS PUT INTO THIS FUND. WHAT SPECIFIC. SUCCESS STORIES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT COMMUNITY OUTREACH FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH CSP G. WELL I CAN. OFFER THE EXAMPLE OF THAT CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OUR REACH SO AS I MENTIONED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING M. HAS FORMED A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO PROMOTE GREATER AWARENESS TO THE CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL BOTH BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL GUARANTEE COME TAX CREDITS AND TAX PREPARATION SERVICES. AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE EFFORTS WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF REALIZE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE CLAIMED THOSE CREDITS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO DO SO AND IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE FIND OUR COMMUNITY BASED THE CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE AND PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OUTREACH TO AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE SUCCESS AND IT UP TURN OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN CLAIMING. THAT VALUABLE RESOURCE I WILL TELL YOU THE DECEMBER DINO THAT IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE OUTRAGE OF FOR THE KELLY I TO SEE I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE COMMUNITY AFTER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CAME OUT AT THAT TIME IT WAS FIONA MAMA CAME OUT WITH THE BIG BUS AT THE COMPUTER SET UP AND DID A LOT OF WORK HERE SORRY. THE OUT REACH FOR ME IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THE SERVICES AND THE FUNDS TO THE PEOPLE. WHO MOST NEED THEM. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU THINK IT'S VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE IT THE PRESENTATION I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT HEARING FOR THE FLATTENED BLOCK GRANT STATE PLAN WHICH WE DO EVERY TWO YEARS CORRECT. YES FOR FIRST AND BASICALLY HAD TO FORGIVE THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION SO. I WAS LOOKING AT FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE SERVICED I DID NOTE THAT AT LEAST ON THE SHEET I AVE ACTUALLY DOESN'T BREAK OUT WITH TINO SO I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OUR WHO ARE SERVING IN TERMS OF OUR REP ETHNIC RACIAL. HE'S I WOULD POINT OUT I MEAN WE DO HAVE 19% OTHER SO IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT LIKE TO THE OTHER IS AND PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T REPORT. AS A MEMBER OF THE API CAUCUS I WOULD MAKE NOTED THAT ASIANS ARE ONLY 5% OTHER WERE HAVE. TREMENDOUS INCOME DISPARITIES IN THE API POPULATION SICKLY. IN OUR PACIFIC ISLAND AGREES BUT ALSO AMONG ASIAN COMMUNITIES SO. I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE SERVING SO FEW API. YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE A IN IN THE MEDIA ANSWER FOR PRESS SOMETHING COULD RESEARCH IF SOMEONE COULD PLEASE. GET BACK TO ME ON THAT SO AND ALSO AGAIN I MAKE NOTE THAT LATINOS ITEM ON THE LIST SO I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE DOING WITH THAT AS WELL SO IN TERMS OF REPORTING IT COULD BE GOOD FOR US TO HAVE THE KIND OF DATA LET US KNOW. WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO RE DIRECT I REALIZE THAT THIS MAY BE ALL SELF REPORTED DATA SO THAT HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES PEOPLE MAY NOT WANT TO BUT STILL IT BE GOOD TO HAVE A BREAK DOWN OF THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS. NOW IF YOU DO LISTS THAT I DO LISTA THESE ACTIVITIES. AS WELL I HEAR IT'S THIS WE HAVE SOME EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE GET SERVICES THE LIVER AND A SO IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN UNDER INCOME AND ASSET BUILDING SERVICES AND AGAIN YOU HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM THE ONLY THIS IS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BUT- ONLY TWENTY FOUR ARE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SAID THEY INCREASE OR SAVINGS. HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PROXIMALLY RECEIVE HOUSING ASSISTANCE SERVICES. ONLY SEVENTY THOUSAND WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF A RECEIPT OF RACIAL TERROR AND SO FORTH. SO I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THE OUTCOMES ABDULAZEEZ ARE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS RIGHT CELL AND I MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL AND SAYING THAT WELL. HE HELPED LESS THAN HALF OF THEM I MEAN THEIR CHILDREN AS PROBLEMS BUT IN TERMS OF THE EVALUATION. I THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT. AND BETTER REFLECT. BOTH WHAT'S BEING DONE AND THE REASONS FOR THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACHIEVED ANY AYE SO I HAVE A HARD SENSE. TO GET TO FEEL WHETHER IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT CETERA SO. IS THERE SOME PLACE THAT THERE'S A REPORT THAT ACTUALLY SAYS WELL THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE AND THIS IS WHAT THE EXPECTED OUTCOME WAS AND. WE EITHER HIT THE MARKET WE DIDN'T HIT THE MARK ON THOSE THINGS. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TO MENTION. OKAY SO YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS A NEW REPORTING WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THOSE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SERVICES AND OUTCOMES AND POOR OUTCOMES AND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS SIR AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN GO AFTER FOLLOWING THE HEARING I COULD DO SOME FURTHER RESEARCH THIS IF WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD EXPLAIN SO WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AS HAVING A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR EVALUATION PLAN OF WHAT SORT REPORTS WE EXPECT. BACK SO WE KNOW IT IT IT AND I SHOULD I JUST IT ALSO JUST SAY IT I MY BACKGROUND ACTUALLY OF THE ONLY PEDIATRICIAN I ACTUALLY WAS A PROFESSOR AND TO ME THAT ELEMENT AT UC DAVIS COMMUNITY BUILDING IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS TALK TO MY STAFF AND I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DID SO WHAT DOES BLACK GRANT DOES WHAT YOU DO IS RIGHT IN LINE WITH THAT SO IN THAT SENSE IT OUT AND I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE DOING IT OKAY BUT I'M ALSO ASKING SOME THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I. WANT OF A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW WE WANT TO STEP IT UP HERE A LITTLE BIT AND REALIZE THAT THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL GRANT YOU HAVE FEDERAL CONSTRAINTS I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO TO THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PRIDE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THAT AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT EIGHT SOME OF THE LA I DO THINK THAT YOUR AGENCY DOES AND CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES OFTENTIMES OF SAMPLE THE STUDY LOOKING AT WELL WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN POVERTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT DISCUSS ALL THE BACK TO YOU KNOW PRESENT JOHNSON'S ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY OLDER AND I AM THIS PROGRAM IT STARTED BEFORE I WAS BORN IT'S BUT IT REALLY WAS ABOUT FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BILL DOES THAT SOCIAL CAPITAL THE SODAS LINKAGES BETWEEN PEOPLE AND- THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY OFTEN HAVE FEWER CONNECTIONS RIGHT AND IT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES NOT OBVIOUSLY THEY ALSO A FEW RESOURCES RIGHT SO YOU WILL HAVE FEWER. RESOURCES AND FEWER CONNECTIONS SO EVEN. A. GET OUT SO EVEN IF WE GIVE PEOPLE MORE RESOURCES. THAT I ITSELF WILL BE HELPFUL BUT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HELP THEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN ALSO BUILD THOSE CONNECTIONS NEXT. WE WHAT I THINK AT LEAST MY READING AS IS WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP DID RIGHT CRIES IT'S DO THAT SO I YOU KNOW I WANT YOU TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND I REALLY DID WANT TO YEAH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. I'M ALSO HOPING THAT WE CAN GET A BIT MORE INFORMATION I ALSO KNOW THIS IS A TWO YEAR EVERY TWO YEARS SO MAYBE MY LAST QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON IS THAT SINCE THE LAST TWO YEARS THE HEARING TWO YEARS AGO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED IN THIS TWO YEARS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING DIFFERENT FOR THIS NEXT TWO YEARS SO I'M NOT SURE I QUITE HER I HEARD A LOT OF PRESENT. TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PRESENTATION APPRECIATED ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO I LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST TWO pTO CHANGE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO MOVING FOR TO. MAKE THIS PROGRAM YOU BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE. RIGHT SO. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT TO IMPROVE HIS. DATA COLLECTION AND DEFINITELY YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS OR ARE TIMELY. AND WE CAN FACTOR THAT IN. WE HAVE BEEN IN THE CONVERSATION WITH THE FEDS ON. THIS ISSUE REPORTING AS A AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO. A NEW METRICS THAT WE'RE USING TO BETTER QUANTIFY THE OUTCOMES OF THIS IS B. T. PROGRAM. SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A FOCUS IN IN TERMS OF SERVICES AS EMPHASIZE IF THEY PLAN. THIS ISSUE OF. HOUSING THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING. IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S FRONT AND CENTER FOR MOST OF OUR COMMITTEE ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT IS A PRESSING ISSUE AND WILL BE MOBILIZING TO ADDRESS IT. IN IN DIFFERENT FORMS. OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE AND NOW CERTAINLY DOES FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM YOU NEED TO MEET THOSE. I ALSO HOPE THOSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT DATA COLLECTION AND SO FORTH THINKING ABOUT. IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE AND I AM INTERESTED AND YOU DON'T SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY JUST ON DATA COLLECTION. BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT. KIND OF THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL IN TRYING TO CONSTRUCT YEAR DATA COLLECTION AND DATA REPORTING AN EVALUATION. IN DO YOU WANT TO ADD. YES I WOULD AND WORKING HERE BUT I WANT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT DATA COLLECTION AND OUTCOMES. YOU'D YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A BROAD I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO WAS WITH THE BROAD. NUMBER WAS. HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND THEN THE OUTCOME WAS. KNOWS THAT A CHIEF TEMPORARY SHELTER AT HALF. WELL THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT WHICH IS SOMETIMES THE BEST OUTCOME UNDER HOMELESS AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE IS NOT. TO RECEIVE TEMPORARY SHELTER. SOMETIMESTHE BEST OUTCOME IS TO STAY IN YOUR HOME. AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT RECORDED THERE SHOULD. THE DATA COLLECTION WE HAVE A DOESN'T ALWAYS REFLECT ALL OF THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THAT COULD COME UNDER THAT BROADER HEADING. WE HAVE SO PLEASE HELP. US HELP YOU BY HELPING US BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR OUTCOMES THAT SO I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS REALLY BAD RIGHT THESE ARE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS SO. HAVING THAT CONTEXT. AND EXPLANATION WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. NUMBER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU TO HER TITLE AND- JUST TO PUT SOME CONTEXT ON A FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MANDATE TO HAVE BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE HEARING OVER YOUR FUNDING. AND AS SUCH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT UR QUESTIONS ARE BEING VERY DIRECTED INTO BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU ABOUT OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS SO WHILE I CAN APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING MAYBE THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT. COULD DO MORE WORK. I'M LUCKY THAT MY SENATOR HAS ACTUALLY PLACED MY MOTHER ON TO ONE OF THE AGENCIES ON THE BOARD. THAT IS BEFORE US HERE TODAY. YET I FIND THAT YOUR MISSION AS CST AS YOU WROTE IT IS TO FOSTER A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION. THAT'S A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH. I STRUGGLE IS WHATIF MY COUNTY IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN WHAT WE KNOW IS AN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING. THAT WHOLE PERSON CARES. IS THERE EVER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN IN THESE CONTRACTS THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE WITH THE EEOC. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOSSES ARE BEING HEARD AT FRESNO COUNTY. THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARES PROGRAM THAT WE AS A STATE OF PUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO THE BUDGET THIS YEAR IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION AND TEAM COULD HELP TO MAKE THE CASE. FOR WHY HOLD PERSON CARES IS THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR MY COUNTY TO BE PARTICIPATING IN MIKE BECAUSE WHAT I FEEL THAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. OTHER COUNTIES ARE UTILIZING AND MY COMMUNITY. AND MEMBERS ARE ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN. AND SO I'D LIKE SOME ASSISTANCE IF I CAN FROM THIS GROUP SINCE WE ONLY MEET EVERY TWO YEARS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT BY TO SEE IF YOU CAN HELP US. WITH THIS ASK THROUGH OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE ARE NOT PARTICIPATING CURRENTLY IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARES PILOT PROGRAM. AND HAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. BECAUSE FOR SPENDING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR EOC. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF COLLABORATION THEY'RE DOING. THAT'S MORE BENEFICIAL. THEN APPLYING FOR THE WHOLE PERSON. PROGRAM RIGHT SO. I'LL START WITH THAT I DO WANT TO SAY A COUPLE AT A BOYS ARE AT A GIRLS IF I CAN BLOCK CORPORATE THE OF THEY CAMPESINO THE CALIFORNIA IS A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS PROTEUS SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND THE VALLEY DO GREAT WORK. I CONTINUE TO LOOK TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND MY COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE ISSUES AND FEARS REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO. CONTINUE TO USE THOSE RESOURCES. BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU TWO QUESTIONS IF I COULD. THE FIRST IS REGARDING A TASK FORCE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE A. IT'S ON PAGE EIGHTEEN THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TASK FORCE I WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAD ANY UPDATES AND THE SECOND WAS IN THE OVERVIEW THAT WE HAD. REGARDING. THIS HEARING TODAY CURRENTLY CSP G. IS. TO NOT. THE ONLY BE FUNDED FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNDER A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IS THERE A PARITY IS THERE ACTUALLY A LEVEL THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. IS IF THE STATE WAS INTERESTED AND WILLING. I LOOK TOWARDS THINGS LIKE MEDI CAL WHICH HAD A 138% WHERE'S THERE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MAKES LOGICAL SENSE. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT AND WHAT WOULD THE COST BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT'S NOT INHERENTLY TIED TO THE STATE PLAN BUT I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE THAT. OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THOSE TWO QUESTIONS WITH. IT IS A OF FRESH FOR AS THE FUNDING GOES NOT ONLY IS THAT SOMETHING WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A LOT OF. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ESTABLISHED THAT RATE ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED A FEW TIMES TO MAKE SOME INROADS. INTO GETTING. LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA TO MATCH THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION 110025% AND I'M NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. YEAH WE WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT HAVING THAT HAPPEN TO BE PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. PART OF CAL CAP AS WELL AS TO A WORK AS THE ADVOCACY ARM OF THE IN NETWORK AND SO. THAT I GET TASK WITH A LOT OF THAT STUFF. AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU OR WITH ANYONE ELSE IS INTERESTED IN DOING THAT TO INSURE THAT WE CAN. ALIGN STATE LEGISLATION WITH FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BE FUN TIME LOVE TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE ON THAT SPECIFICALLY IF WE CAN. BUT THEN IF WE COULD GET AN UPDATE ON THAT TASK. APPRECIATE THAT TOO. I'M SO AS FAR AS THE TASK FORCE. I DON'T PARTICIPATE IN IT DIRECTLY BUT- I DO KNOW THAT I WE HAVE HAD INTEREST AT THE- APARTMENT. IN EXPLORING HOW. HEALTH CAN INTEGRATE INTO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON OUR AND SHE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE DEFINITELY THERE'S A DIRECT ACCESS TO THE HOME. THE HOME WE ABILITY ASIAN THAT OF THE OUR PROGRAMS PROVIDE. AND NOT ONLY FOCUSING ON ENERGY REDUCTION. AND CLIMB. IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. BUT ALSO CAN BE USED OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THOSE HOMES. AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. WHEN EXAMPLE AND THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY. PUBLIC HEALTH TERMS OF A PILOT THAT. THEY SHOULD SOME LIGHT ON ARE THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO IMPACT AIR QUALITY. AND PROVIDE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE HOME. THAT COULD TO PROVIDE POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR. YOUNG CHILDREN DEALING WITH ASTHMA OR OTHER. RESPIRATORY ISSUES. AND THEN ALSO WITH. WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AS IS OCCURRING IN OUR STATE AREAS WHERE. THERE'S A NEED FOR BETTER REGULATING OF INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURES. WHERE SOME OF ALL THE BALL THE BALL POPULATION MEMBERS. YOU KNOW CANNOT DEAL WITH. YOU KNOW EXTREME HEAT OR EXTREME COLD AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THEIR HOMES ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THAT. THEIR BASIC NEEDS OF REGULATING THE INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURE. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY. GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO INSPIRE HEADING. AND THAT'S AN AREA OF FOCUS RIGHT NOW FOR THE PART. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I MAY CHAIRS. NOTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK OF. OUR CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES THAT SHE'S DONE ON E. I. T. C. AND- I TEN. WELL WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES. THIS YEAR THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE AND. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR A. I. T. C. IS SOMETHING I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. CAN WORK ON NEXT YEAR SO THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION. CAN CONTINUE TO HELP US WITHOUT WHICH- FUTURES. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM WHICH TO WORK COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THE DOCTOR PAN MENTIONED ABOUT BUILDING WEALTH. IN THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS CAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP WITH FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WITH DOWN PAYMENTS IS THAT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX IS THAT. NOT PART OF THIS BOX. FIVE MINUTES NOT NOT. NO I PUSHED THE SENATE NOT ON OKAY. SO IF I MEAN I GUESS THE BEST WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE IT WOULD BE A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING AT LESS THAN A 100% OF POVERTY LEVEL. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THAT LOW INCOME A FAMILY OF FOUR THAT MAKES TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR EVEN WITH DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE IT WOULD NOT BE A FAMILY THAT COULD SUSTAIN A MORTGAGE AND THEY BARELY CAN SUSTAIN SOMETIMES SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT AROUND SO WE'RE DEALING WITH THE POPULATION. KIND OF BY FEDERAL DESIGN THAT IS SO LOW INCOME THAT NOT ONLY OUR OUTCOMES HARDER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT DOCTOR PAN MENTIONED THAT THE I DON'T HAVE ANY SAVINGS WELL YOU KNOW ONCE PEOPLE GET A. B. I. T. C. CREDIT IT JUST TRYING TO KEEP THEM ABOUT WATER YOU KNOW THEY PAY THEIR BACK TO P. JEANNIE BELL OR THEIR BACK TO RANT BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND SO THEY'RE CONSTANTLY MAKING A DECISION OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY AND SO HE I. T. C. I ALWAYS SAY GIVE HIM SOME BREATHING ROOM. SO THAT THEY CAN CATCH UP AND MAYBE YOU KNOW NOT WORRY ABOUT WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS GOING TO COME FROM OR IF THE LEVELLERS GONNA COME KNOCKING SO IT'S A GREAT IDEA IT'S JUST OUR PEOPLE ARE SO LOW INCOME EVEN WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE TEST SUSTAINING MORTGAGE IN ALMOST ANY. COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA WOULD PROBABLY BE A LEAP OF FAITH. AND IS IT SOMETHING THAT IF ONE OF THE PROGRAM ONE OF YOUR- ANTES WERE TO FIND A WAY TO HELP ITH THIS AND OF COURSE THEN THE PAYMENT WOULD BE THROUGH SUBSIDIZED. HOUSING ASSISTANCE. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE WORKED ON. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS OUT OF THAT'S THE GREAT PART ABOUT C. S. B. G. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT TIME. DR RANDALL AS WELL IS EVERY TIME TWO YEARS EVERY COMMUNITY RIGHTS WHAT IT'S CALLED THE COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN IT GIVES THE DEPARTMENT A LOT MORE TEETH IF YOU GO TO THOSE PUBLIC MEETINGS OR EVEN IN WRITING MAKE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT PLAN. THAT SAYS WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE OR WHAT YOU THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT BECAUSE MANY TIMES THOSE AREN'T PARTICIPATED IN HIGHLY OR MAYBE PEOPLE COME AND THERE'S ONE OR TWO AGENDAS INSTEAD OF MAYBE A BROADER AGENDA OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T REPRESENTED SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE STRONGLY ANY IDEAS THAT ANY OF YOU HAD OR ANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT I THINK COLLUDED IN THAT COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET CHANGE MADE IN THAT COMMUNITY IS WHEN THE COMMUNITY STATE THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED. AND TWO MORE QUESTIONS IF I MAY. ONE IS A FUNDS FOR DAKAR RENEWAL I BELIEVE IS IN ONE OF YOUR PRESENTATION YES SO THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR DOCKERY YES. HUH ALL RIGHT IT DID IT AGAIN THE REQUIREMENT IS THE TO. THE TO QUALIFY FOR CIVIL CRACKED OKAY. MY LAST QUESTION. HAS TO DO WITH FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS. SECTION SIX SEVEN SIX BE SEVEN TALKS ABOUT THIS PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE THAT THE STATE WILL PERMIT AND COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION SIX SEVEN EIGHT D. DOES THIS INCLUDE IMMIGRATION STATUS SO IF THE FEDS ARE ASKING FOR PROGRESSION STATUS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED IF THAT IS SOMETHING. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HASN'T COME UP IN THE PAST AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU A YOU POSE THE QUESTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE BACK IN AND FOR THE RESEARCH TO GIVE YOU A CORRECT ANSWER. THANK YOU I CAN TELL YOU THAT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY HAS A LOCAL PLAN TO RESPOND. WE ONLY RESPOND IF THERE'S AB WARRANT. WE WILL NOT GIVE JUST BLANKET INFORMATION SO I THINK EVERY AGENCY. KIND IT DOES WHAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH OBVIOUSLY ONCE THAT OUR ARMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MIGHT RESPOND DIFFERENT THAN PRIVATE NON PROFITS ARE WILLING TO RESPOND. BUT WE HAVE A VERY YOU KNOW AT OUR OUR STAFF IS TRAINED OUR SITE TO TRAINED. WE YOU KNOW HAVE SAMPLES OF CORRECT WARRANT SITTING CORRECT WARRANTS WE HAVE. SECURE AREAS SO WE HAVE SIMPLEX ABILITY BECAUSE WORD NONPROFIT BUT I WOULD SAY THE AGENCIES THAT ARE ARMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT. RESPONSE. TO THEM FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO I HAVE A JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ARE. MISTER LEE I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF GET A SENSE FROM YOU WHAT TRENDS OR CHANGES YOU KNOW HAVE YOU OBSERVED AND THE PROGRAM OVER THE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. OR DURING YOUR TIME. OKAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SO I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THAT IN TERMS OF THE CHANGES ONE IS GOING BEYOND REPORTING AS WE ARE LOOKING TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO. QUANTIFY IT'S TRUE IMPACT ON THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE AS WELL AS- POVERTY IN THE STATE THE SECOND WILL BE THE AND THIS EMERGING ISSUE OF HOUSING. AND THE HOMELESS. POPULATION THAT THAT THE STATE IS MOBILIZING TO BETTER ADDRESS AND THEN I WOULD SAY ARE. IN ADDITION TO THAT FOR FROM A DEPARTMENT STANDPOINT DISASTER RESPONSE IS ANOTHER AREA YOU KNOW MIGHT PROBABLY GOING BACK OVER THE PAST FOUR FIVE YEARS IT WAS THE DROUGHT YOU KNOW EMERGENCY THAT WE WERE RESPONDING TO NOW THAT HAS EVOLVED INTO WILDFIRES THAT THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTING. A GREAT DEAL OF OUR CAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AS A STATE SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT ARE AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENT CAN BETTER AND BETTER INTERSECT. AND RESPOND. TO THIS DEFINITELY IS THE IT HAS THE IMPACT ON THOSE THAT WE SERVE. SO I KNOW YOU MENTIONED AND TOUCHED ON AND NATURAL DISASTERS. WHAT WHAT ROLE HAS THE DEPARTMENT OR THE PROGRAM PLAYED WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOST RECENT NATURAL DISASTERS AND WE HAD HERE IN THE STATE. GREAT CUSTOMER REQUEST IN. SO THE PARKING PLACE TO ROLL SO DEPARTMENTS CONNECTED TO THE STATE RESPONSE SO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES AND CAL REMEMBERS YOU SEE SERVICE RESPONSE WE ARE PART OF THAT NETWORK OF STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT RESPOND AND WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT WE OBTAIN FROM THERE TO. TO RELAY TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE TO THE NEEDS THAT EXIST. DURING AND FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN ADDITION. WE ARE SERVICE NETWORKS INCLUDE ENERGY PROVIDERS AS WELL AS OUR C. S. B. T. FUNDED AGENCIES. AND THOSE THAT THE MINISTER THE ENERGY PROGRAMS HAVE OTHER EMERGENCY PROVISIONS THEY'RE BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM. THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE UPON THE NATURAL DISASTER SO FOR EXAMPLE A TRANSPORTATION SERVICES HOME VOUCHERS ASSISTANCE WITH ENERGY OR PROVIDING TEMPORARY GENERATORS AND THINGS THAT NATURE THOSE ARE THE PROVISIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED UNDER THE FEDERAL PROGRAM SO. IT'S CRITICAL AND TRY TO ORCHESTRATE HOW THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTER IN IN OUR IN OUR AND THEN ON THE COMMUNITY THE CSPC SIDE. AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE FACT THAT THESE DOLLARS A MORE FLEXIBLE IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS OR SOMETIMES POSITION TO DO SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST THOSE THAT ARE OFF THE OFFERINGS OF AND YOU PROGRAM. IS WORKING WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT HOW THEY CAN POSITION THEMSELVES TO DO AN IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT AND THEN ALSO IDENTIFY WHAT AND NEEDS THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN IMPACT YOU KNOW. WITH THE FUNDS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IN ADDITION WE'VE ALSO STREAMLINED HOW ARE PROGRAMS CAN RESPOND TO A NATURAL DISASTER SO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN TRIGGER OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE THESE DOLLARS THAT THAT WE HAVE IN THE DISCRETIONARY FIND MAKE. THOSE LAWS AVAILABLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AGENCIES. THANK YOU. I KNOW YOU ALSO TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE DROUGHT CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE. THAT AS A DEPARTMENT YOU'VE DONE UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WITH THE DROUGHT RESPONSE THERE WERE TWO THINGS BOTH WITH THE DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS. WE FIND THE WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO BASICALLY IT WAS. MODELED AFTER OUR FRONTAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES UTILITY ASSISTANCE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS PAY THEIR- COVER THE COST FOR THE HOME ENERGY WE PROVIDED SIMILAR SYSTEMS FOR WATER THEY WORRY INDIVIDUALS DURING THE DRY OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD THE- IMPLEMENTS THAT WERE IMPACTED OR LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THE DROUGHT. AND WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY MAKING ENDS MEET AND ALSO THERE WERE COST INCREASE COSTS TO WATER SERVICE AND ACCESS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO HELP OUR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BETTER COPE WITH. IN ADDITION WE DID RECEIVE A SMALL ALLOCATION ARE SMALL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL FINDS THAT WAS USED TO ESTABLISH TO DROUGHT EMERGENCY. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM DATA PROVIDED EIGHT A VARIETY OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WORKED IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY THAT HAD THEIR EMPLOYMENT IMPACTED DIRECTLY BY THE DROUGHT SO THAT PROVIDED HOUSING ASSISTANCE VOUCHERS EMPLOYMENT TRUCK JOB TRAINING. ALSO RETRAINING IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRY SO FOLKS ARE WORKING AGRICULTURE THEY COULD WORK IN TRUCK DRIVING OR SOMETHING ELSE SO IT WAS A VARIETY OF SUPPORTS TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THE STORM A AND B. AND GET ON THEIR FEET FINANCIALLY. AND OVERCOME SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT. OKAY I'D I'D JUST DONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSE AYE AYE EARLIER TODAY I HEARD FROM A MEMBER OF MY COMMUNITY THAT. DOESN'T HAVE HAS A SPOTTY. ENERGY AND AT YOU SAID HIS IN THERE YOU KNOW IN THEIR HOME AND UP AND ALSO WATER IS STILL A MAJOR ISSUE EVEN EVEN THE ONE LONGER DROUGHT SO I YEAR THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TRULY NEAR AND DEAR. AND SPECIFIC TO MY TO THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AS I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF BROWN'S MONEY AS WELL. SO BIG SO MUCH FREE RESPONSE I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. MORE SO FOR OUR. OUR COMMUNITY ACTION I WANTED TO REALLY. GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT IS THAT YOU RECRUIT OF YOU KNOW FOR YOUR BOARD MEMBERS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE TO. HAVE HAVE IT BE REFLECTIVE OF THE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IT SERVES SO AND EVERYBODY IF YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE SAME END POINT BUT HOW YOU GET THERE'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON YOUR COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY ARE I CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGENCIES ARE VERY SIMILAR. I'M IN HOW THEY RECRUIT AND IT HAS TO BE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS FOR THE LOW INCOME REPRESENTATION IN OUR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WE ADVERTISE OPENINGS THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS YEAH AND- HELP PEOPLE GET LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO SIGN A PETITION FOR THEM TO RYAN AND THEN WE DO A BALLOT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CENTERS. THERE'S COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE COMPETITION AND THERE'S COMMUNITIES FOR YOU DON'T HAVE COMPETITION AND SO WHEN ONLY ONE PERSON SIGNS UP WE JUST TO A PUBLIC NOTICE AND THEN THAT PERSON IS SEATED A THIRD OF OUR BOARD OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. SO MANY TIMES WE TRY TO GET THEM FROM EACH FIVE OF EACH OF OUR FIGHT SUPERMAN'S ARIAL DISTRICTS AND SO WE SEND A BLANKET LETTER TO ALL OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THOS SUPERVISOR DISTRICTS WHEN WE HAVE AN OPENING AND SAY THIS IS KIND OF OUR MISSION THIS IS WHAT THE OBLIGATION WOULD BE. AND THEN IF AND YOU HAVE A TRYST AND THEN WE LET THE ELECTED OFFICIALS DECIDE AMONGST THEMSELVESBECAUSE THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW AUTHOR HELP STRING THAT WE WANT TO PUT ARE TELLING AND THE THIRD WAY THAT WE HAVE WITH MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR DEFINITION OF A MAJOR ORGANIZATION IS SOMETHING SOMEBODY THAT HAS A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS. CAM THAT REPRESENT TEN SHARES OUR VISION AND MISSION I'M IN THE COMMUNITY I'M NOT AN APPLICATION PROCESS AND THE BOARD THEMSELVES DECIDES FROM THE APPLICATION PROCESS WHAT COMMUNITY GROUP WOULD WOULD CERTAIN THE MOST DIVERSE. POPULATION OR MAYBE AREAS THAT WERE NOT BEING HEARD. SO IT'S A VERY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TIME HERE DAY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS. IF SOMEONE. SO NEXT TIME BUT LIKE TO COLOR SECOND PANEL JUST PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU. ALREADY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PATRICIA NICHOLS BUTLER AND I'M THE CEO COMMITTEE ACTION PARTNERSHIP CONSENT MEDINA COUNTY. I THINK YOU CENTER AUTONOMOUS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOING THIS WAY AS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT. FUNDING IN OUR COUNTY. IT MAKES A HUGE IMPACT BUT THE RESIDENTS THAT WE SERVE EACH AND EVERY DAY. I JOIN YOU TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF OUR COUNTY AND THE INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING POVERTY. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT FUNDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN RECEIVED A GRANT OF A PROXY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF CAN YOU SERVICES BLOCK GRANT FUNDING. AND WE WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT FUNDING TO A TOTAL BUDGET OVER TWENTY FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU THE ABILITY. AND THE BENEFIT OF A COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT IN ALLOWING US TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE. OR AGENCY. BUT ALSO. TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT NOT ONLY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS. BUT ALSO PRIVATE FUNDS THAT WE APPLY FOR ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO WITHOUT FINDING WE LEVERAGE ABOUT NINE DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR CCG FUNDING. IT IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE LIFE THE SAME SERVICES THE SAME RATING ACCOUNTING TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. THE LARGEST COUNTY. NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE UNITED STATES. BY POPULATION WERE JUST OVER TWO MILLION. AND FROM AS A SLICE WE ARE NOT ONLY LARGE BUT WE ARE. AND WE HAVE A PARTS WE TWENTY ONE SQUARE MILES OF LAND MASS. MAKING IT THE FIFTH MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. LIVING IN POVERTY WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THE STATE. ALREADY RATE IS EVEN WORSE FOR BOTTOM ALL POPULATIONS SUCH AS SINGLE WOMEN CHILDREN AND ETHNIC MINORITIES. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES. FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND ADULTS AND CHILDREN SEVENTEEN ACCOUNT LIVE IN FOOD INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS. I LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE USE THE SBG FUNDING FOR AND HOW THEY HELP MEMBERS OF THESE VITAL POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE ACTUALLY PARTNERSHIP SEVENTY NOW OPERATES THE LARGEST FOOD BANK IN THE COUNTY. WE CONTRACT WITH APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED LOCAL AGENCIES WHICH INCLUDE CURTIS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY CENTERS TO OPERATE FOOD PANTRIES. WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WE DISTRIBUTED OVER FIFTEEN NINE MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD. LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND DUPLICATED HOUSEHOLDS WITH FREE FOOD THROUGH THESE PANTRIES ADDITIONALLY WE CONTRACT WITH TWENTY FIVE SOUP KITCHENS ACROSS THE COUNTY THAT PROVIDED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND NUTRITIOUS MEALS TO THE MALL FOOD IN CONCERT IN SECURE INDIVIDUALS. IN OUR COUNTY. OUR FOOD BANKS STARTED THREE NEW EXCITING PROGRAMS WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE FIRST IS OUR SENIOR CHOICE PROGRAM. WE WERE EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SENIORS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY POVERTY AND SO THIS PROGRAM ALLOWED US TO PARTNER WITH SIXTEEN. A CENTERS THROUGHOUT SAN MARINO COUNTY AN APARTMENT LOCATIONS PROVIDE HEALTHY FOOD TO THOSE SENIORS RESIDING THE SEVEN A FARMER'S MARKET SETTING. AND WITHOUT SETTING I INDIVIDUALS BECOMING A SELECT ORGANIC PRODUCE ANY TYPE OF FOOD THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE MOST OFTEN IT'S HEALTHY FOOD FOR THE SENIORS. IN ADDITION WE PROVIDE SENIORS WITH HYGIENE ITEMS THAT WE PROCURE IN TERMS OF DONATIONS AND FOR THE SENIORS LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME THE AVAILABILITY OF FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER HEALTHY FOOD ITEMS. HAS BEEN LIFE CHANGING. ANOTHER NEW PROGRAM WE STARTED AS A RESULT OF IS CONDUCTING A POVERTY SYMPOSIUM. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT OUR LOCAL UNIVERSITIES. WE IDENTIFIED THAT A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ATTENDING COLLEGE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FOOD. AND THAT WITH THIS AGAIN THE BEAUTY OF CSP G. AT THE END THAT ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY IN THE- AND TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THAT NEED. SO WE DEVELOPED WHAT'S CALLED THE CAMPUS COVER PROGRAM. WHICH CAUSES THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH EIGHT LOCAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE THEIR TO FOOD AND SECURE STUDENTS. HYGIENE ITEMS AND OTHER SUPPLIES. AND THE THIRD PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOPED WAS OUR FOOD PHARMACY PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH A PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANY CALL LANDMARK HEALTH. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM IS UNIQUE THAT IN THAT IS HELPING LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM DIABETES BUT DISSIPATE IN THE PROGRAMMING GO THROUGH A SIX WEEK DIABETES EDUCATION COURSE INCLUDING HEALTHY COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS. OF PARTICIPANTS WHEN THEY BEGIN THE PROGRAM THEIR BLOOD IS DRAWN AND CHECKED ON THE FIRST SESSION AND READ JOHN AT VARIOUS INTERVALS OVER A SIX MONTH TRACKING TO SELL THEIR PROGRESS AND SUCCESS. THE FOODS PHARMACY PROGRAM HAS NOT ONLY TOPIC DISMISS THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY EATING HABITS. IT HAS PROVIDED THEM WITH MAGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR HEALTH AND WE KNOW FROM OUR STUDIES THAT WE'VE DONE THAT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. DISPROPORTIONATELY ARE AFFECTED IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SO WHAT BY US BEING ABLE TO TEACH THEM THROUGH. CLASS COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS AND ALSO PROVIDING THE FOOD. FOR THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS MANY OF THEM REPORTED IMPROVED RESULTS. WE STARTED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS LAST YEAR AND ABOUT 59% OF THOSE SO THE CHANGE IN THERE AB ONE C. LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND THAT WE OPERATE THROUGH OUR FOOD BANK WE ALSO UTILIZE THE SBT FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN WHICH CLIENTS ARE GUIDED TO MEET SPECIFIC GOALS SUCH AS GETTING AN EDUCATION. OPENING THE BUSINESS OR GETTING A JOB. WE OPERATE A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH HAS EIGHT UNITS. IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS RESIDE FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. AND AT THE END OF THAT TWELVE MONTHS. THEY ARE ABLE TO MOVE ON TO PERMANENT HOUSING IF THEY'RE NOT THERE EXTENDED UP FOR ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE TRANSITION OFF OF. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAIN WHATEVER PERMANENT HOUSING THE IDENTIFY. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN A VERY IMPORTANT SERVICE IN OUR COUNTY BECAUSE WE KNOW HOUSING COSTS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. NOT ONLY MOST OF OUR LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE HAD IN THE VIXEN. AND SOMETIMES TO WHICH PRECLUDES THEM OR MAKES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET A LANDLORDS EXCEPT THE MEN TO HOUSING. WE ALSO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO THOSE IN NEED OF EMERGENCY HOUSING TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE. AND FINALLY OUR VALUE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM PROVIDES FREE TAX PREPARATION TO MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE COUNTY. AND I WANT TO THANK OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOMEZ REYES FOR BEING SO SUPPORTIVE OF. OUR BY THE PROGRAM AND COMING OUT IT ACTUALLY HELPING US TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM THROUGHOUT SAN MEDINA COUNTY BY DOING A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS THE JEEP GRAND IS A CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNERSHIPS AMEGHINO COUNTY TO RELY THESE CRITICAL IN LIFE CHANGING PROGRAMS TO THE LOW INCOME CITIZENS OF SAN MARINO COUNTY. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION TO YOU THAT WITH OTHER FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE RCEIVE WE'RE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF UTILITY ASSISTANCE SO WE HELP KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS. BECAUSE OF THE LIKE HE PROGRAM. WHILE WE CANNOT I WOULD THIS PROGRAM WITH OUR CSP GEE IT IS DEFINITELY PROGRAM THAT WE OPERATE IN PARTNERSHIP AND PROVIDE THE- ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE HOW IMPORTANT THESE FUNDS ARE FOR ORGANIZATION. AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES A SEPARATING A COUNTY A COUNTY THAT IS VERY MUCH STILL STRUGGLING. THANK YOU. DOOR MICROPHONE. I U. K. MY NAME IS GREG GEAR I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INDIAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL OR AND SEE IDC USUALLY ARE MOST PEOPLE RFER TO US AS I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE ON THE USE OF COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS TO HELP POVERTY LEVEL AMERICAN INDIANS AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF IF NOT THE ONLY STATE IN THE UNION. THAT HAS AN AMERICAN INDIAN SET ASIDE UNDER THE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. CALIFORNIA HAS MAINTAINED AN INDIAN SET ASIDE OF THREE POINT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INDIAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL IS ONE OF TWO ELIGIBLE CSP G. ORGANIZATIONS ALONG WITH THE COULD DRIVE. THAT ARE BOTH THE LIMITED PURPOSE AGENCY AND A NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION OR AGENCY UNDER CS THESE DESIGNATIONS. BOTH ENDS THE IDC AND THE CUT A TRIBE WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNATED AS LIMITED PURPOSE AGENCIES UNDER THE COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT AND IT WAS THAT STATUS THAT MADE AS AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY THAT CONTINUES TODAY. NC IDC IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION THE MEMBERSHIP CONSISTING OF INDIAN TRIBES AND INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS. ARE ORIGINAL DIRECT SERVICE AREA IS NORTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE NAME NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INDIAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL WE STILL HAVE PRIMARY SERVICE DIRECT SERVICES IN BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND HUMBLE DON'T NOR SISKIYOU AND TRINITY COUNTIES. AND OFFICES IN EACH. BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WE WERE APPROACH TO TAKE ON THE JOB OF PASSING THROUGH AND ADMINISTERING THE STATE WIDE. COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE ELIGIBLE ENTITY'S UNDER THE LAW. WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND OVER ONE HUNDRED TRIBES THAT WE WORK WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND LAST YEAR THERE WERE OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE INDIAN PEOPLE TOUCHED BY COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO THIS LARGE AMERICAN INDIAN ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SEE IDC HAS ESTABLISHED A SUBCONTRACTOR NETWORK OF AMERICAN INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND DELIVER DIRECT SERVICES. THE MAJORITY OF THESE SUBCONTRACTORS HAVE ALSO BEEN DESIGNATED AS U DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. NATIVE AMERICAN GRANTEES UNDER THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OR W. Y. O. A PROGRAM. OUR AMERICAN INDIAN SET ASIDE PROGRAM. AUGMENTS THESE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING AND OTHER ANCILLARY SERVICES. AND ALLOWS US TO CASE MANAGE CLIENTS WITH BOTH CS BG AND W. I. AWAY RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ADDRESSING BARRIERS THE CONS FACE IN ACHIEVING SUCCESS. IN MOST INSTANCES THE ADDITION OF THIS FUNDING HAS EXPANDED THE CAPACITY. OF THE SUBCONTRACTOR AGENCIES STRENGTHEN THEIR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS. AND PROVIDED A CATALYST TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR THEIR AMERICAN INDIAN SERVICE POPULATIONS. WE'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TODAY THAT WE HAVE BEING DEVELOPED AND I'M PART PROUD TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM. WE HAVE A ONLINE TRIBAL COLLEGE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED BY CALIFORNIAN IN MANPOWER CONSORTIUM WITHIN OUR NETWORK TO DO ENTREPRENEURIAL AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND BUSINESS START UP TRAINING THEY'RE ALSO DOING CARE TAKER TRAINING THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY EXCITING TO SEE ONLINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING TO BE ABLE TO REACH VERY RURAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS AND COMMUNITIES THAT OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WE HAVE AN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNER THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCARE AMERICAN INDIAN RESOURCE CENTER WAS DEVELOPED ON SITE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THAT THEY HAVE INTEGRATED INTO THEIR CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. WORKING WITH UST DOWN THERE AND THEIR PROGRAM THEY DO PRACTICALS INTERNSHIPS FOR THE GRADUATE STUDENTS TO GET THEIR HOURS UNDER SUPERVISION AND THEY'VE INCORPORATED TRADITIONAL TRIBAL MENTAL HEALTH. TRIBAL TRADITIONAL HEALTH ASPECTS INTO CONTEMPORARY COUNSELING SERVICES AND TALK ABOUT INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC THE SOME OF THE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE AND THEY'RE ACHIEVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN FACT WE'RE CURRENTLY TALKING ABOUT. DISTANCE MEDICINE AND WHETHER WE CAN EXPAND THIS OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER ASPECTS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE A HUGE IN TERMS OF MARKETING AND OUTREACH A HUGE EFFORT FOR CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. OUTREACH EFFORTS RIGHT NOW WITH IN INDIAN COUNTRY IN STATE IS A GENERAL ON THE ENTIRE STE MY ENTIRE CS BG NETWORK IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED WE HAVE SMALL GRANTS FROM THE ON CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT. COMMITTEE THAT ARE HELPING US FUND SOME OF OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS EVERY TRIBE EVERY SUBCONTRACTORS INVOLVED I DIDN'T A FOR TRY BLOOM HENCE THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF WITH STAFF TABLING DOING OUTREACH TRYING TO GET COMMUNITIES THAT THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO GET TO. THE KLAMATH SALMON FESTIVAL OF THE IRAQ TRIBES A SOVEREIGN DAYS OF THE COOPER TRIED. CULTURAL DAYS OF. THE WE ARE DRIVING IN A WEEK OR TWO WILL BE UP THE CALLER WAS MISTER. BUT HOLLOW WITH ANY NATION DOING THERE. WE'RE ONLINE WITH SOCIAL MEDIA WE ARE DOING MAIL CAMPAIGNS WERE DOING POSTER CONTEST WITH KIDS. INDIAN COUNTRIES ENGAGED AND WE'RE GOING TO GET EVERY INDIAN PERSON AND EVERY PERSON LIVING IN INDIAN COUNTRY COUNTED THIS YEAR. BROWN'S THE TABLE. ANOTHER PROGRAM I'M EXCITED ABOUT IS THE INDEED JUST INDIGENOUS EDUCATIONAL ADVOCACY PROGRAM BEING FUNDED BY A FOUNDATION TO HELP INDIAN PARENTS WITH DISABILITY CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES THEY HAVE ARE YOU PEAS REVIVAL FOR PLANS. THERE'S DISCIPLINE OR- DIFFERENTIAL DISCIPLINE HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOL WERE ESTABLISHING AN EDUCATIONAL ADVOCATE TO HELP EMPOWER PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO BE ON PARA COMMITTEES TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEIR CHILDREN TO GET THEIR DISAPPEAR DISABILITY PLANS RECOGNIZED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THIS IS PROGRAMS STARTING UP IN NORTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND. ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF IS OUR DISASTER RESPONSE ON AND SAID YOU SEE IS ABLE TO UC SBG AND SOME RAPID RESPONSE MONEY TO DO INITIAL SURVEYING OF COMMUNITIES AFTER A DISASTER. AND WE THAT ARE ABLE TO APPLY FOR AND GET THE NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS USED TO BE CALLED NATIONAL EMERGENCY GRANTS INTO PLAY TO DO CLEAN UP. AND REPAIR ON RESERVATIONS IN INDIAN COMMUNITIES. FROM DAMAGES I CURRENTLY HAVE CREWS WORKING ON THE FIRES OF THE TWENTY SAID THE STORMS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MENDOCINO AND NOW THE STORMS THAT HAPPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE ARE CALLING THE SEVERE STORMS OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE JUST NOW BEEN TOLD THAT WE WILL BE FUNDED FOR SOME CLEAN UP CREWS FROM THAT ONE AS WELL. THESE CREWS GO OUT AND HIRE DISLOCATED OR LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED INDIAN PEOPLE. USUALLY FOR FIVE TO ACCRUE GIVE THEM SOME TOOLS AND SOME TRAINING AND PUT THEM IN THE COMMUNITY THEY CLEAR GOLF CULVERTS OR- CLEAR FIRE DAMAGED FENCING OR BRUSH OR WORK ON BUILDINGS OR WHATEVER IS NECESSARY. TO TRYING CLEAN UP AND REPAIR FROM VARIOUS DISASTERS. IN REGARD TO THE ON RESERVATION AND RANCHERIA ALLOCATIONS IN C. IDC CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH EACH TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OR THEIR DESIGNATED TRIBAL ENTITY FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES WITHIN THE RESERVATION RANCHERIA WE SUCCESSFULLY USED THIS FUNDING TO AUGMENT. EXISTING PROGRAMS ON RESERVATIONS INITIATE NEW SERVICES AND EXPAND CAPACITIES TO ADMINISTER AND OPERATED USUAL PROGRAMS. ON MANY SMALL TRIBES GET UNDER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR ONE FIVE ZERO ZERO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. I THINK THIRTEEN TWENTY IS CURRENTLY THE MINIMUM ALLOCATION. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WITH THE FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT OFTENTIMES GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING VERY MEANINGFUL. SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE ON TRIBES AS YOU LOOKED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS A LOT OF COMMUNITY GARDENS. AND OTHER RELATED WELLNESS AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS YOU'RE SAYING YOU THE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT AND USE CAREER EXPLORATION IN WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAMS. CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. ADULT EMPLOYMENT TRAINING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ELDER EMERGENCY SAFETY NET SERVICES AND SIMILAR ACTIVITIES. WE APPRECIATE A PARTNERSHIP THE AMERICAN INDIAN SET ASIDE NETWORK IS ESTABLISHED WITH NON NATIVE CSP G. AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES YOU SEE SITTING HERE AT THIS TABLE. AND THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE STAFF AND LEADERSHIP OF THE COMPARTMENT COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT AS WE WORK ON ADDRESSING POVERTY. AND PROMOTING SELF SUFFICIENCY IN INDIAN COUNTRY AS DESCRIBED IN THE DRAFT PLAN BEFORE YOU TODAY. I FINALLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN MAINTAINING. THE CALIFORNIA. SENATE SIDE FOR INDIAN PEOPLE WITHIN THE CS BG PROGRAM. IT IS UNIQUE. IT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL IT IS A LOT OF A LOT OF SMALL TRIBES THAT DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE RESOURCES OF LARGER AND OTHER TRIBES TO REALLY DO MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES. AND I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO OUR STORY TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND STATE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. TO SHARE ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE MY NAME IS THOMPSON OR A ON THESE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMMUTER ACTUALLY TO SEE IF YOU COUNTY INC. AND JUST A LITTLE BIT I I'VE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD A BIT LONGER. AND FOLLOW PATRICIA AS THE HEAD OF OUR STATE ASSOCIATION PRECEDED BRENDA. AND ALSO WAS CHAIR WHERE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF THE CAN ACTUALLY SEE IF YOU COUNTY HAS SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. SERVE THE COUNTY OF NEW AND OTHER SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR GREATER ECONOMIC SECURITY OF LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. WE DO SO THROUGH A BROAD VARIETY OF STRATEGIES THAT RESPOND TO NEEDS SO THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT US AS A AS A WHOLE BEFORE FOCUSING ON WHAT I WAS REQUESTED TO FOCUS IN ON. IN THESE STRATEGIES WERE IN RANGE FROM ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO FOOD BANK TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR WORKERS HOMELESS FAMILIES AND SENIORS. IN OUR WORK INVOLVES MANY PARTNERS. AROUND SHARED INTERESTS OF IMPROVING OUR COMMUNITY IS FOR ALL OF US TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFIT OF LIMITED RESOURCES. WE'RE NONPROFIT MEMBER OF THE STATE'S COMMUTERS SERVICEABLE GRANT FUNDED NETWORK.

ALONG WITH COOPER SPREADING THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE IS IN THE US CENSUS COMPLETE COUNT EFFORTS. BUT FOR RIGHT NOW I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON ON THE ROLE OF SEIZE BG IN DISASTER OF RESPONSE. AND WELL I CAN SPEAK OF THIS SOMEONE DISPASSIONATELY THERE ARE STILL MANY WHO CANNOT. A NORMAL DAY OUR WORK IS CHALLENGING A 20% OF OUR POPULATION IS UNDER THE POVERTY GUIDELINES ARE VACANCY RATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING I READ ABOUT 1% AND YET ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH THE CAMPFIRE TURNED IT INTO THE WANTING. OF BEST PRACTICES CALL FOR PREPARATION BY NONPROFIT SUCH AS OURS FOR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD CHALLENGE OR ABILITY TO CONTINUE BUSINESS. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE PREPARED ANYONE FOR WHAT HAPPENED AS THE FIRE WARD AT TIMES AT THE RATE OF ONE FOOTBALL FIELD PER SECOND. DISPLACING OVER 500-005-2000 PEOPLE AND WIPING OUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. I WOULD BE CA AS FORTUNATE AS WITH OTHERS IN OUR NETWORK AND IN OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE AND ARE COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION AND OUR PURPOSE.

THISIS SIMILAR RESPONSIVENESS STAY CST STAFF MADE AVAILABLE FUNDING FROM THE DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROGRAM. OUT OF WHICH WE WERE THEN ABLE TO THAN HELP FOLKS TO LOCATE INTO WHATEVER AVAILABLE APARTMENT HOUSING THERE WERE. IN AND UNFORTUNATELY. FOUR ZERO FORTUNATELY TO EVEN RELOCATE OUT OF THE AREA BECAUSE- THE ALL OF THE HOUSING WITHIN A SEVENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS WAS WAS TAKEN UP WITH SURVIVORS WHO HAD. PLAYED A FLEA OF THE DISASTER.

AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE PLEASE TRY MEN SO ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HELP SUPPLEMENT THE CCG PROGRAM HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS AS OUR VITA PROGRAM WHICH IS NOTED IN THE STATE PLAN I BELIEVE ON PAGE THIRTY FOUR AND SO OUR CAT K.

AWESOME PARTNER I'M WITH CAL EA T. SEAT WHICH IS A PROGRAM AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT INCREASES AWARENESS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LOW INCOME. ON AND FOR US IT'S BEEN. GREAT BECAUSE SEIZE THAT HOUSE IS REALLY NEAT MODEL I'M THAT IS CALLED NEXT PROGRAM THAT HIGHLIGHTS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SHARE TO SO WE'RE LEARN I'M LEARNING A LOT TODAY FROM OUR BROTHER AND SISTER CAP AGENCIES. ABOUT SOME OF THE COOL PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE RUNNING BUT SEES THAT SHOULD BE DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHTED FOR SOME OF THE NEAT THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE ON KELLY ATC DOLLARS. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE BLIGHTED JUST A LITTLE BIT STEP FURTHER AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO FOR THE UPCOMING TAX SEASON IS. ON INCORPORATE A% FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT PIECE WHERE WERE FILING TAXES WELL FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING THEIR TAXES BUT WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH IT. IT WHAT KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE CARE WE PROVIDING TO THEM IN TERMS OF BUDGETING WHAT IS SHORT TERM LONG TERM PLANS LOOK LIKE SO WE'D LIKE TO INCORPORATE THAT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE UTILIZING A MODEL CALLED YOUR MONEY YOUR GOALS AND NOT MODEL SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN OUR EASTERN ON RESOURCE CENTER AND MEET SMALLER IT'S A SMALLER COMMUNITY. BUT FOLKS ARE ABLE TO KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR BUDGETING ISSUES AND HOW TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE SO WE'D LIKE TO INCORPORATE THAT IDEA BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAPTURED AUDIENCE. I'M THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORTED PERSONALLY BY CSP G. IS OUR TWO ONE PROGRAM TO CALL CENTER. IT'S A TWENTY FOUR HOUR INFORMATION REFERRAL SERVICES PROGRAM. FOR THIS LAST CALENDAR OF EIGHTEEN WE REACHED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE ON CALLS. WHICH WAS HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALLS WHICH IS HUGE FOR US WE ALSO SUPPLY BACK OFFICE SERVICES FOR ABOUT FOUR OTHER COUNTY SO NOT ONLY DO WE DO CURRENT. WE ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO. KINGS TO LATER. POST MERCED WHICH ARE THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS AND STANISLAUS. AND WE MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF ABOUT THREE THOUSAND COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR THE COUNTY OF KERN WHICH IS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO PARTNER WITH SOME OF OUR AGENCIES NOT ONLY BY PROVIDING SERVICES. BUT ALSO LEVERAGING SOME FINE SO WE CAN GET SOME GRANTS. TOWARDS TWO ONE ONE ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS AB COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM SO OCTOBER OF EIGHTEEN IS WHEN CAP CASE STARTED AND BECAME THE DESIGNATED COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM FOR CURRENT SO WHAT THAT BASICALLY MEANS IS THAT. ALL HOMELESS CALLS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE COUNTY COMING THROUGH TWO ONE ONE THEY'RE IDENTIFIED AS A HOMELESS COLOR PER FEDERAL GUIDELINES. AND THEIR PUSH TO ARE COORDINATED ENTRY TEAM WELL WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS IDENTIFYING THOSE INDIVIDUAL PUTTING HIM INTO AN H. MY A SYSTEM WHICH IS ARE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. AND THIS IS A SHARED PLATFORM AMONG ALL HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDER SO THAT WAY WE HAVE A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY. FOR EVERYONE THAT WERE SERVING IN THE COUNTY WERE ABLE TO SEARCH I'M WERE ABLE TO SAY. YOU KNOW PATIENT RARE CLIENT A RATHER CAME IN AND WENT TO ONE SERVICE PROVIDER AND- SOMEONE LOOKING FOR THEM FOR PAPERWORK. INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM THE RUN AROUND WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM IN THE SYSTEM WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THEY WERE SEEN WHAT'S A GAP. HOW DO WE ADDRESS IT. AND SO THAT'S IS NOT CORNET ENTRY PROGRAM THAT IS OPERATE UNDER TWO ONE ONE UMBRELLA AS BEEN WORKING REALLY WELL FOR US. TO DATE WE'VE HANDLED ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CALLS IN THE USERS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. I'M AND THEN CONDUCTED ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED Q. OR TEASE WHICH ARE QUICK REFERRAL TOOLS. IT'S JUST DIDN'T REALLY QUICK SNAPSHOT ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE AND THEN WE DO A STEP FURTHER INTO THE V. ICE THE DOUBTS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR SINGLES AND FAMILIES TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY'RE AT AND FROM SEVERITY OF HOMELESS. ARE USE SOUT COUCHSURFING WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED HOMELESS AT THIS POINT DID YOU SLEEP IN A PARK LAST NIGHT OKAY WELL THAT SEVERITY LEVEL IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. AND SO IT'S AWESOME BECAUSE WERE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF OUR ON. HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTY BUT ON ONLY THAT WERE ABLE TO INCORPORATE SITTING COUNTY IN THIS EFFORT SO IT'S NOT ONLY ONE OR. TWO AGENCIES WORKING ON IT IT REALLY IS A COUNTY UP FOR. I'M SO THAT'S KIND OF A NEAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTED THREE CS BG. WHAT I CAN'T PICKED UP. FROM OTHER FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF NEAT INITIATIVES THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON A WERE YOU THE PANEL WOULD LIKE TO SEE. ON HOUSING IS SOMETHING THAT IS UNDER UMBRELLA THAT WERE RESEARCHING SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO JUST. COME IN AN OVERLAPPING DUPLICATE SERVICES WE WANT TO SEE WHERE WE FIT IN. ON AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE EXTENDED IN THE HOMELESS OR YOU KNOW BY POTENTIALLY BECOMING A DRUG SERVICE PROVIDER. WITH THAT MEANS FOR US RIGHT NOW IS JUST RESEARCHING OPTIONS OF LOOKING AT LOW VERY HOUSING EMERGENCY SHELTERS. WHAT CAN'T ACCOUNT AGENCY DO ON TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY. A MODEL THAT WE'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IS CAPS LOS TO LOSE BUT STEINBERG'S OFFICE THEY HAVE FORTY PRADA WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. AND IT REALLY MEET THE NEEDSOF THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING OUR AGENCY COULD POTENTIALLY DO. AND IT'S WITH C. IS FISH G. FUNDS THEY WERE ABLE TO. KIND OF HELP US RESEARCH IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO AND POTENTIALLY YOU SEE IS THE G. TO HELP SUPPORT THAT EFFORT. YOU KNOW BLOCKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT WAS. THANK YOU FOR INFORMING US ABOUT THE FORT WORTH FIGURAL TOO LEAN VERY INFORMATIONAL A LOT OF GREAT THINGS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING ON. AT THIS MOMENT I'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS WILL START WITH THEIR CULTURE COURSE. THEY'VE ALL DESERTED US WERE TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS HERE. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU'VE HEARD WHAT SOME OF THE OTHERS ARE DOING WITH THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND SO MY QUESTION IS DO YOU SPEAK REGULARLY TO ONE ANOTHER TO FIND BEST PRACTICES MAYBE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE IS DOING SEE IF THAT CAN BE DUPLICATED IN YOUR PARTICULAR PROGRAM. SURE YEAH. JOHN I GREW WE LEVERAGE OUR OUR MICROPHONES. IT'S OKAY OUR OUR OUR EFFORTS BECAUSE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF COORDINATION COMMUNICATION FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW PAT AND I SERVE ON STATE TO MAKE CESSATION. BOARD TOGETHER AND I'M ALWAYS STEALING IDEAS FROM. SO YOU. I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A SENIOR ADVOCACY WEEK IN THE DISTRICT WHERE WE TAKE ONE WE CAN WE VISIT SENIOR CENTERS SENIOR HOUSING AND WE SCHEDULE THESE MY FIRST YEAR IS FOURTEEN SECOND YEAR TWENTY ONE THIS YEAR WE HAVE THIRTY AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO PARTNER WITH PATRICIA AND THE ORGANIZATION THEY'RE GOING TO GO WITH US TO PROVIDE THE HEALTHY FOODS FOR SENIORS AND HYGIENE HYGIENIC PRODUCTS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THROUGH ONCE I SAW WHAT WE WERE DOING SINCE THE PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT CLEARLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO WE WERE ELECTED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO PARTNER WITH ANY ORGANIZATION. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROGRAMS I ABSOLUTELY I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU ALL ARE GOING TO PARTNER WITH US THANK YOU. JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE SYSTEM WITHIN HOURS I REACHED OUT TO CAPS THE NOMA WHO HAD ENDURED THE CHOIR THE PRIOR YEAR AND WAS ABLE TO. BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THAT. IN SOME WAYS AND WE CAN HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US TO HELP PROVIDE. SOME MEASURE OF COMFORT AND IN AN EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE BUT THERE ARE TO BE THOSE FOLKS WHO ONLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MONEY. AND SO WE WERE FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO CAPS IN NORMAL WHO HAD OF THEIR THEIR MODELS OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO US. WITHIN JUST TWEAKED A BIT SO THAT WE COULD THEN INSURE THAT WE WERE JUST REACHING OUT. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HELPS OUR FOLKS WHO WERE. DESPERATE. THE SEMINARY SAID. SPAHN BACK ALSO TO OTHER. PLATFORMS WERE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION AND BEST PRACTICES OUR STATE AGENCY COMMITTEE SOURCES BARTON VELLUM IT. CONDUCTS MEETINGS WITH ALL EXACT DIRECT THE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND ALSO STATE ASSOCIATION. OF THEIR MEMBER ORGANIZATION THAT ALLOWS LOCKED ME ACTION AGENCIES TO.

THEY'RE THERE SOME OF YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CENSUS COMPLETE COUNT TWENTY TWENTY SOME OF THE WORK YOU'RE DOING DIRECTLY. IS ARE ALL OF YOU DOING SOMETHING WITH THE WITH THE CENSUS. YEAH YEAH YEAH. COUNTY WERE PERFECT FOR ME. THE ACCOUNT COMMITTEE AND WHERE I'M HEADING THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT AT THAT IT'S AFTER ON AND WERE USING TWO ONE ONE TO KIND OF LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE COMMUNICATIONS AND IF FOLKS CALLING FOR ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION I WAS INTERESTED IN THAT AS WELL WE HAVE A TWO ONE ONE FOR ARE HOMELESS AND SO THE CALL COMES DIRECTLY TO YOU RIGHT SO DO WE OPERATE THE TWO ONE PROGRAM INDIVIDUALS CAN CALL INTO TWO ONE ONE. THEY GO THROUGH I IRON OUR STAFF MEMBERS AND THEY'RE CALLING IN FOR HOMELESS SERVICE IN OUR INFORMATION. REFERRAL SPECIALIST SORRY HI SO MANY ACRONYMS. AND SO THEN THEIR PUSH TO OUR COORDINATED ENTRY TEAM AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE EITHER TO ABLE TO THEN DO A- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY GET INTO THE SYSTEM. WONDER IS THAT SIMILAR FOR THE REST OF YOU TWO ONE ONE TWO ONE ONE COME TO DIRECTLY TO YOU OKAY MEDINA COUNTY IT IS THE INLAND EMPIRE UNITED WASTED OVERSEAS SUPPORTING ACTRESS SYSTEM MEAN FOR US IS UNITED WAY AS WELL IN OUR LOCAL AREA WONDERFUL. A FREE SO YOU USE MISTER OXIDE IT WAS. ONE STOP OPERATOR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. IT WELL THAT'S KIND OF THE VISION OF A ONE STOP SHOP FOR ITS LOCAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD HAS BEEN DRIVING THEM MESSAGE WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS. SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN A REYES SERVICES FOR SOMEBODY TO GET SOMETHING AND THAT'S THAT'S THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY OF US IT WE HAVE A REYES SERVICES OR WITH HER PARTNERS THAT WE CAN DELIVER IT WHO CAN MAKE A GO TO IF THEY NEED SOMETHING SOME OUT. SO THERE'S WHAT HAPPENED WHAT COUPLE SOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING SO THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME FOR MY PERSONAL FARMWORKERS AND DON'T GET ME WRONG THEY GO TO THE ONE OUR OUR POPULATION THEY THEY HAVE MULTIPLE BARRIERS BET THAT THEY'RE A GREAT WORKING COMMUNITY. THEY MAY GO FOR THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT PROGRAMS MAY THEY MAY HAVE A LANGUAGE OR OTHER THINGS AS BARRIERS AND THAT RATE FOR A FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT SO THEY ARE OFTEN DIRECTED BACK TO ASK FOR A WE WORK WITH THE MOST CHALLENGING AND POPULATION WERE GLAD TO DO THAT JUST FOR THEM TO GIVE THEM THE HELP UP MESSI ESPECIALLY BRINGS THAT PART OF IT. IN LOCAL ME ACTUAL PROGRAMS AND LOCAL CAPS TO THE SAME THING WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PHILOSOPHY IN AN INTERVIEW ENERGY TO PLAY I HAVEN'T TAKEN EXCEPTION I GET DISCOURAGED NUMBER. ONE STOP SYSTEM SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET LOST. BE ENERGETIC AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. NO ON THIS PROPERTY SYSTEM. SO THAT'S OUR OUR PHILOSOPHY OUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU I KNOW MR KERRY WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH THE CENSUS IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU YOU THEM TO BECOME THE MAIN ORGANIZATION TO COUNT OUR NATIVE AMERICANS AMERICAN. THERE'S A WIDE NATIVE COMPLETE CAP COMMITTEE AND ALL OF OUR SEIZE BG NETWORK THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS PART OF THAT STATEWIDE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FUNDED AND WE HAD TO TWO MEETINGS ALREADY AND WE ARE THERE THERE WAS A- A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INDIAN COUNTRY AS AS ON A LOT OF NON INDIAN PROGRAMS FROM THE LAST CENSUS LICENSES DID NOT DO AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE COUNT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE IT DIDN'T COLLECT THE DATA IN A WAY THAT COULD BE USED TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY. THE NUMBERS NECESSARY FOR THE A PORTION OF MONEY AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS AND PROGRAMS BEEN SUFFERING. SINCE THAT TIME AND WE'RE STILL USING NINETEEN YEAR OLD. FOLKS WALKING DOWN THE RESERVATION DIRT ROAD TO THEIR HOUSE ON THE TOP OF THE HILL TO ASK THEM TO FILL OUT A FORM. TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF REALLY UNIQUE CHALLENGES THIS YEAR IT'S GOIN TO BE ONLINE. HAVE INDIAN COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE AN INTERNET OR COMPUTER. MOST OF INDIAN COUNTRY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES HAS PO BOXES THE BOXES CAN'T DO THE ONLINE THEY'RE GONNA GET SOMEBODY IS GOING TO WALK UP TO THEIR DOOR OLD SCHOOL AND GIVEN A PAPER FORM. THEY WILL PUT IT IN THE MAIL AND I WALK UP AND GIVE IT TO THEM A HUGE AMOUNT OF DISTRUST. WE'RE ESTABLISHING QUESTION ASSISTANCE CENTERS IN QUESTION ASSISTANCE KIOSK SO WE CAN GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND GIVE THEM A SAFE PLACE TO COME TO WILL HELP THEM GET THE NUMBER THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ONLINE BECAUSE THERE IS A PROCESS TO DO THAT IF YOU JUMP THROUGH IN A FLAMING HOOPS. AND TRY AND GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE PLACE THAT THEY CAN DO THE CENSUS AND COMPLETE THE CENSUS. AND REALLY ENGAGING THE USE ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE REALIZING I CAN SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS TERM HAS COME HOME AND ALWAYS LISTEN TO ME. BUT WHEN IS YOUR TEENAGE ME SQUARE SON OR GRANDSON OR GRANDDAUGHTER OR SOMEBODY THAT'S TALKING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT THEY SEEM TO HAVE A VOICE MORE. LISTEN TO. REALLY I DO AND HOW ARE YOU THE MASTER'S INDIAN. KNOW THAT IN THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. OF CENSUS COUNT IS GOING TO BE. IT ALWAYS IS A PROBLEM THE- CHILDREN ARE COUNTED. OR THERE'S ALWAYS AN UNDERCOUNT OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD IN THE NOW WITH THE- THE RHETORIC FROM THE- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ABOUT CITIZENSHIP BE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A QUESTION. ENOUGH DOUBT WAS PUT INTO THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND- THESE ICE RAIDS. SO WHEN. THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WHEN. SOMEBODY COMES KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. THEY ALREADY THINK OF EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN READ. THEY'VE BEEN HEARING AND READING. ABOUT AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT CHALLENGE. A WORD MISTER DECIDE THAT YOU USED. WAS TRUSTED. ON WEEKEND. I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF. THE ORGANIZATIONS. BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR SO MANY YEARS. THE COMMUNITY KNOWS YOU. THE COMMITTEE HAS RELIED ON YOU. AND THE COMMUNITY TRUSTS YOU. SO THE MESSAGE THE NEEDS TO GO FROM. SACRAMENTO TO THE COMMUNITY. SHOULD GO THROUGH YOU. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY DOES TRUST YOU.

THAT HAVE BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND OUR TRUSTED BY THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE JOBS TRAINING PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE AT AT PROTEUS IS IT IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY YOU KNOW YOU DO ART YOUR TRACKING OR WE HAVE A LOCATION FOR A SCHOOL THAT WE FOR. IF WE FORM SOME YEARS BACK AND PART OF OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE JOB TRAINING SO WE HAVE A SKILL CENTER AND WHICH WOULD PROVIDE. AN RSS SERVICE CENTER. OFFICE AUTOMATION IS BASIC OFFICE SKILLS TRAINING. IT UNTIL POINTS IN GETTING A JOB HOPEFULLY AN OFFICE IN GOING TO MAYBE SOME MEDICAL ASSISTANT OR SOME RIDING DIFFERENT THINGS. OR JUST JUST BASIC COMPUTER SKILLS I THINK YOU GO WITH THIS ONE OFFICE SETTING WE HAVE TRUCK DRIVER TRAINEES BAND. A PARTY A MODEL THAT HERE'S A LOT OF JOBS IN TRACKING THE TRUCKING INDSTRY HAS BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL IN FOR FARMWORKERS FOR OUR POPULATION. EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AS SOMETHING AS A QUICK JOB THEY CAN GET THE TRAIN PASSED THE TEST AND THEN. WE HAVE SOME OF OUR PURCHASES THAT AREN'T THAT FORM THEIR OWN BUSINESS ALREADY THE ONLY ONLY TRUCKS. AND THEY COME BACK IN AND WE COULD TRY THIS SUMMER. A BUSINESS AND THEN WE HAVE SOARED TRAINING WE'VE BEEN IN THAT ARENA FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. JUST BASIC FOR INSULATION AND FOR. SAY A INITIALLY WAS THE SCORE FARMS. AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND NOW IT'S ABOUT FOUR HOMES. BED DOWN WITH THE PROVIDING OF TRAINING FOR QUITE AWHILE QUITE A BIT OF TIME ALREADY. AND WE ALSO OFFER TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD STANDS PURCHASED A MR LASSEN BECAUSE RIGHT TRAINING. AND IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT FOR THEM. THE CHARGE BAY. IT'S ALSO FOR A- FOR SOME DAY I DON'T HAVE A CAPACITY OF SCHOLARSHIPS TRY TO GET HIM THROUGH. OUR MISSION FOR THE MOST PART HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND. I WOULD SAY ENGLISH. AND JOB PLACEMENT AND TRAINING THAT'S WHAT WOULD DRIVEN IS THAT'S WHAT. DRIVES PEOPLE TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT IN THE LONG RUN. AND SO ANOTHER QUESTION I KNOW THAT BECAUSE HAVE VERY RESPECTED ORGANIZATION AND YOU'VE BEEN HERE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IN THE VALLEY. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK YOU KNOW ALL THESE YEARS. AT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT. YOU KNOW HOW PROTEUS HAS GROWN VAULT OVER OVER THAT TIME. WE HAVE ONE FROM THE VERY BASICS WHILE FORTUNATE STATION AT THE WARM PARTLY FREQUENCY IS THE ONE THAT THE BIRTH CAME ABOUT THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY AGENCIES. THE SAME WAY. Y. PRODUCE THE NAME PRO IS A UNIQUE. NAME AND I SHARED WITH THEM ARE CALLED MCCAULEY. OUR FOUNDERS GOT TOGETHER IN THE PHONE THAT NAME AND IF IT MEANS FIRST OR- IT ALSO MEANS CHANGE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE FOUNDER STOP APPROACH TO CHANGE CONCENTRATION IS TRUE. MY CAREER AND THE PRICE IS ALWAYS ABOUT CHANGE EVEN NOW. OUR STATE WE AS BABY BOOMERS KIND OF SAUDI SO YOUNG. WHEN OUR CHANGING BECAUSE THE YOUNGER GENERATION COMING UP AND IT IS CHANGE ORGANIZATION IS HE EVER EVOLVING CHANGING. FROM A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE ALL OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS STRONG NOW. AND THAT'S A LOT OF IS BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY WE BRING TO THE TABLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND I CAN BEING INVOLVED IN A LONG TIME PARTNER BRINGS THAT TRUST FACTOR WITH A FUNDING SOURCES. YEAH WE HOLLOW EASE MAKE OUR PRODUCTION BUT WE NEED TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ARE STRONG AND ANYTHING THAT WOULD TOUCH AND DEAL WITH. AND OUR PHILOSOPHY LEAST FROM MY LEADERSHIP ON THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN LOW ABOUT PARTNERSHIP. AND I REALLY BELIEVE STRONGLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL. PART OF THE CHANGE. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW I ALSO WANTED TO ASK MR HERE. YOU KNOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME AND LEVERAGING OF. OF A FEDERAL CS BG DOLLARS TO BRING FOOD TO THE ELDER SHINES IN THE LAKE I RANCHERIA CAN YOU.

THE BLUE LAKE RANCHERIA HAS A ELDERS NUTRITION PROGRAM WHERE THEY MAKE MEALS PACKAGE UP SEVERAL MEALS AND WOOD FROM THE ELDERS HOME AND THEY THEY DON'T YOU IDEAL HAVING SAILED OR NOT SENIOR THAT'S IN IN INDIAN COUNTRY ITSELF. BUT THEY'LL DELIVER THE HOME SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT LIVING STYLE AS AN ELDER THEY CAN HAVE PRE COOKED MEALS AVAILABLE TO THEM PULLED OUT OF THE FREEZER BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM UP AND IT'S A REAL VALUABLE SERVICE TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE FOR OUR ELDER COMMUNITY. THE ADJACENT COUNTY OF TRINITY COUNTY BLUE LAKE RANCHERIA IS IN HUMBLE COUNTY AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAM IN THEIR SERVING PEOPLE ON THE RANCHERIA AND IN IN A LARGER AREA OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY. THERE TRINITY COUNTY WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY RURAL AN EXTREMELY IMPOVERISHED ON COUNTY THIS DIRECTLY ADJACENT A HUMBLE DIRECTLY EAST OF IT DOES NOT HAVE A PROGRAM. AND WE HAD IDENTIFIED ALMOST FORTY INDIAN ELDERS WHO WERE AT RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PROGRAM TO SERVE THEM. AND SO IN CA DC FOUND A VOLUNTEER FROM THE AROUND MARK NATION AN ELDER HIMSELF WHO SAID FOR GAS REIMBURSEMENTS I WILL BE A VOLUNTEER AND I WILL GO TO BLUE LINK I WILL PICK THEM UP AND I WILL DRIVE THEM TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS ALL OF THESE ELDERS AND MAKE SURE THEY EACH ONE GETS A MEAL AND PUT HIM IN THEIR FREEZERS AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY AND I'LL BE SOMEBODY YOU CAN CHECK UP ON HIM BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETIMES. SEE SOMEBODY FOR A FEW DAYS AND SO AND WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THAT EVER SINCE YOU'RE ALMOST AS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ONE THE NON. NOT YET FEDERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TRIBES. NONPROFIT FIVE OH ONE C. THREE THAT THEY- DO THEIR TRIBAL THINGS THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE FEDERALLY KNOWLEDGE MY PETITION. AND HAVE BEEN FOR THIRTY YEARS. BUT AND THEN IN THE MEANTIME THEY HELP SERVE THE NEEDS OF INDIAN PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTY AND THEY RECRUITED TO VOLUNTEER AND THEY HELP COORDINATE THE DELIVERYOF THOSE MEALS AND- THOSE ELDERS IN TRINITY COUNTY CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT LIVING. STYLE BECAUSE OF A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR GAS TO GET THOSE MAILED OUT TO. THANK YOU SIR. MR TOMORROW I KNOW YOU TOUCHED ON THIS ON THE WORK THAT YOU THAT YOU YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRY THE FIRES AND- I WANTED TO KNOW. HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW IS THE COMMUNITY DOING HOW. CURRENTLY AND- MR MIA.

TEST A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUAL LOTS THEY JUST CAME OUT OF THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. AND THE ONES WHO ARE BUILDING OR OTHERWISE HAVE WELL. SO WITH THE FORTUNATELY THE DEBRIS REMOVAL IS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO FEMA THE TO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COMING INTO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE RECOVERY EFFORTS IS. ON ITS WAY ARE WE WE'RE PART OF THE INTERNAL PART OF THE CONTINUING CARE I HEAR IT IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND SO WE'RE POSITIONING OUR CONTINUE CARE TO BE A PART OF THE RECIPIENT OF SOME OF THESE DOLLARS THAT ARE. SUPPOSED TO BE IN CALIFORNIA ON THE CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT THERE'S A LITTLE MORE. WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LITTLE BIT ON LIKE THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT. YOU KNOW THE SURVIVORS ARE ARE YOU KNOW. I AM. USING NOW OR RIGHT AROUND NOON IT'S EITHER IF WE CAN MOVE THEM OUT OF THE HOTELS AND MOTELS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME STILL LIVING IN HOTELS AND MOTELS IN THE REGION IF A BECAUSE WE HAVE CASE MANAGERS WHO ARE PAID OUT OF SOME OF THE C. S. P. YOU DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED. TO IDENTIFY WITH THEIR SUPPORT STRUCTURES ARE ELSEWHERE IF THAT'S GOING TO REALLY BE A PART OF THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS STORY THEN WE'RE YOU WERE MAKING THAT AVAILABLE TO THEM YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT COURSE FORCING THEM ANYBODY TO RELOCATE BUT- IN WHEN YOU START COMING TO THE END OF YOUR WHAT IS.

A SURVEY THAT GAVE GREAT STRATEGIES ON WHAT OTHER FOLKS ARE USING A DIFFERENCE STATES AND HOW TO INCORPORATE BETTER SERVICES THAT ARE ON PATIENT CENTERED AND IT KIND OF LOOKED AT THAT WHOLE PERSON CARE MODELS SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT POPULATION.

AND AGAIN IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO THE COORDINATED ENTRY MODEL I KNOW I SAID COORDINATED ENTRY FOR HOMELESS BUT NOT MODEL CAN APPLY TO ANY SUBPOPULATION IT'S A MATTER OF JUST BRINGING IN. A SUBGROUP OF INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFYING WHO THEY ARE WHAT SERVICES THEY'RE ACCESSING WHERE IS THE GAPS IN SERVICES AND HOW WE AS A CAP AGENCY AND OR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY CAN ADDRESS THOSE. ON BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO MULTIPLE PLACES RIGHT SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE SERVICES ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THAT WAS PUBLISHED RECENTLY I THINK THAT IS AN INTERESTING DOCUMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS SUPPORTING.
