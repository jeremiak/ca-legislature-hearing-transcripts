I AT THE SITE OF THE FORMER SAN JUAN MOTEL AND MOBILE HOME SITE ON STOCKTON BOULEVARD. CYNICALLY THE BILL ALLOW THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO'S REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY -- SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY FOR BELOW MARKET VALUE. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH I'M PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE COUNTY IS SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY TO THE CITY SACRAMENTO OR TO THE CITY'S HOUSING SUCCESSOR ENTITY. THE SAN JUAN BLAND PARCELS ONE OF EIGHT PARCELS ARE PURCHASED AND CLEARED FOR REDEVELOPMENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SITUATED ALONG THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AND UNDERSERVED AREA OF OUR CITY. THE PARCELS WERE PRESENT AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR DISTRICT WHICH IS LEAVE ME AND WAY SHORT SUPPLY. I WANTED REDEVELOPMENT ELIMINATE TWENTY TWELVE TO SEVEN SMALLER DECENT PROPERTIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE CITY OF SADNESS HOUSING AUTHORITIES SUCCESSOR AGENCY HALBERT ST ONE PARCEL. WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COUNTY SACRAMENTO'S REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY SUCCESSOR AGENCY THEREFORE SB FORTY ONE ALLOW THE ST ONE PROPERTY BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE COUNTY TO THE CITY. FOR FOR BELOW MARKET VALUE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THESE PROPERTIES FORMALLY TARGETED FOR REDEVELOPING DISPOSED OF EXPEDITIOUSLY AND TO MAXIMIZE VALUE HOWEVER EACH MONTH MORE SECOND A RESIDENTS ARE FORCED INTO THE STREETS BY RISING HOUSING COSTS.

PROPERTY THAT'S RIDDLED WITH ILLEGAL DUMPING ON STOCKTON BOULEVARD THAT WAS ONCE THE OLD SAN JUAN MOTEL. LIKE MANY CITIES SEGMENT IS FACING A CHALLENGE AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. S. TECHNICAL BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO ACQUIRE THE BLIGHTED PROPERTY FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT SUCCESSOR AGENCY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CITY AND THE COUNTY THROUGHOUT. THROUGH OUR HOUSING SAID -- SUCCESSOR AGENCY OWNS SMALL IT JASON LOTS UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROPERTY OF THE OLD SAN JUAN HOTEL IS THE LARGEST PARCEL AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THESE ADJACENT PROPERTIES. THE REQUIREMENTS IN CURRENT LAW AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT HAVE IMPEDED THE ABILITY TO JOIN THESE PARCELS TOGETHER AND EXECUTE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. THE SAN JUAN MOTEL WAS ESSENTIALLY THE ONLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MANY FOLKS -- BEFORE IT WAS A TORN DOWN AND SO THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE TREATED AS A HOUSING SUCCESSOR PROPERTY YOU'RE VOTE WOULD HELP BETTER UTILIZE THIS PROPERTY FOR MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE YES MR BROUGHT SOME REMEMBER FELL. BECAUSE IS THIS LAND PRIVATELY OWNED OR IS IT OWNED BY THE CITY OF STOCKTON RIGHT NOW. SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT -- THAT ONE PIECE IS OWNED BY THE COUNTY AND THEY CAN'T TRANSFER IT TO THE CITY AND THE OTHER SEVEN PARCELS AROUND THAT ARE OWNED BY THE CITY. SO WE'VE CREATED THIS TECHNICAL PROBLEM WHERE YOU CAN'T JOINTLY DEVELOP THE ENTIRE PIECE OF LAND. AND THAT'S WHAT THE SAID BILLS FOR A RESOLVING BECAUSE IT'S ALLOW THE LAND BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE COUNTY TO THE CITY UP LOW MARKET PRICE OKAY AND LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. SOME. SO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COUNTY OF FAILED CORRECT. NO THAT'S A ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THINK THAT'S A GOOD. IN THE THE ISSUE HAPPENED IS THAT AFTER REDEVELOPMENT WAS DISSOLVED. A ANY PROPERTY THAT WAS A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WENT TO REDEVELOPMENT SUCCESSOR AGENCY AND HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF LAWS THAT AND THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW BEFORE WE CAN TRANSFER RELEASE THAT PROPERTY. IS JASON PROPERTIES ARE PART OF THE HOUSE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CLEAR UP THE THE THE LAW HERE SO THAT ALL THE PROPERTIES ARE TREATED LIKE HOUSING SUCCESSOR PROPERTIES AND CAN BE SOLD TOGETHER. TO GET TO THE PROP IT'S ESSENTIALLY SOLVING A BUREAUCRACY OF BARREL PROBLEM. AND THERE'S NO AGREEMENT IN PUTTING IT OUT A BIT. UP THERE A I COULDN'T HAVE GOT THE SACRAMENT HOUSING REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY STAFF TO COME OUT HERE REGARDING A ANY KIND OF BIT QUESTIONS. BUT OUT THERE.

OF LAND AND SEVEN TET DEL LEVEL SIX SEVENTHS OF ITS OWN BY ONE PERSON AND ONE SET AND THE PROMISEOF THE DEVELOPERS CAO LIKE OKAY WELL WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS TITLE ABOVE ABOUT SANDRA AND IT WENT.

B. THIRTEEN NO. THREE THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH YEAH S. P. THIRTEEN NO THREE WILL REQUIRE A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE TO BE ESTABLISHED IN LIEU OF THE SHERIFF CORNERS. AND COUNTIES A POT WITH POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE LAST ACTION LAST THREE STATES ARE TO MAINTAIN A SHARE OF CORNER MODEL TO INVESTIGATE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS. IN THIS MODEL ELECTED STE OFFICIAL THE SHERPAS CHARGE WITH CA CONDUCTING AUTOPSIES AND INVESTIGATE SUSPICIOUS THAT'S INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OPERATOR CHEF CORNER MODEL WHEREBY THE SHARE FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE IF PRINT THAT THE GETTING SUSPICIOUS THAT'S WHY LICENSE POSITION. MUST CONDUCT THE AUTOPSY ITSELF DETERMINATION THE MANNER OF DEATH -- WHICH WHETHER IT'S A HOMICIDE OR AN ACCIDENT REMAINS VESTED TO SHARE THAT MEANS THAT UNDERSHERIFF CORNER MODEL -- THIS THE HEADLONG FORSMAN OFFICIAL WHO NAY THAT MAY NOT USUALLY DOESN'T HAVE A MEDICAL BACKGROUND COULD OVERRULE THE FINDINGS OF A BOARD CERTIFIED FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST THE PERTAINS TO THE MANNER OF DEATH DETERMINATION. S. B. THIRTY NO THREE IS IN RESPONSE. TO ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER INFLUENCE OF THE MEDICAL DETERMINATION POSITIONS CONDUCTING AUTOPSIES IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND ANOTHER COUNTIES.

PRESSURED THEM INTO CHANGING THE FINDINGS REPORTS THE THE VIGILS INVOLVE AN OFFICER RELATED DEATHS THIS IS ALSO ALLEGE THAT CRITICAL INFORMATION WHO WAS WITH HELP FOR THE PURPOSE OF FRUSTRATING THEIR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE TYPE. MANNER OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE D. A. IN SAN WHAT -- CAN COUNTY WROTE ANEDITORIAL THE SACRAMENTO BEE WARY NOTED. THAT THE ACCOUNT IS FORTY SUPPORTED MOVING TO A MEDICAL EXAMS AND WHICH THE COUNTY ITSELF DECIDE BUT HE ALSO MADE NOTE THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE THAT WAS ISOLATED SACKETT TO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ALONE THIS IS A BROADER. PROBLEM WHERE YOU HAVE THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS AS AN EMPLOYEE ESSENTIALLY OF THE A SHARE OF CORNER. NOW ENSURING THAT AUTOPSIES ARE DONE IN AN ETHICAL EQUITABLE MANNER IS ESSENTIAL IN ASSURING CONFIDENCE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE AUTOPSIES ARE OFTEN THE BASIS FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE PUBLIC GAINES A NET THREE FACTORS DETERMINE FAULT LIVER JUSTICE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE JURY AND SOMEONE SAYS HERE'S THE AUTOPSY REPORTS. THAT ARE LEADING TO THE TYPE OF CONCLUSIONS YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE FARM HAS BEEN POUND THE SCALES I ON BEHALF OF THE PROSECUTION OR OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DETERMINATIONS MADE BY POSITIONS MUST BE FREE FROM UNDUE AND INFLUENCE FROM ELECTED FROM POLITICAL OFFICIALS S. B. THIRTY NO THREE IS A VITAL BILL THAT SAFEGUARDS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BY INSULATING THE PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE FACT POSITION THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST FROM UNDUE PRESSURE INTRUSION FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING AND WHO MAY HAVE OTHER -- AGENDAS TODAY HAVE WITH ME DOCTOR LIVES THAT YOU WANT TO THE PATHOLOGIST -- AT SAN JOAQUIN -- WITH YOU.

ALTHOUGH I MEAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFF PERFORMED WHICH SUCH IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IN A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM. STARTED A POT THOSE ON CAUSES ALSO CITES OVER TWENTY YEARS. IN A SYSTEM WHERE DOCTORS ARE IN CHARGE WHAT I DID GIVE ELECT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS. THAT IS A DESKTOP CBO FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. POLICE OFFICERS CANNOT TRAIN. THE STATE OF TEXAS WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF TWENTY FIVE MEDIAN HOUSE FIGHT TRAINING POSITIONS FOR FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS. THIS THAT PROBLEM SOLVING.

OTHER WEEK TO TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST UNJUST TO TRAINING PROGRAMS I SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES. WHICH A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S.

ABOUT OUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF MEDICAL EXAMINER A DEATH INVESTIGATION IN CALIFORNIA IS WASHED DOWN WHAT IT IS IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. IN A STATE OF MISSISSIPPI DEVON PLAY IMPLEMENTED THE MOMENT AND SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO BE GUEST ECONOMY. AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT COST.

WHEN I WAS A PUSHED BY SENATOR UPON ON THE SPIEL I DID MY RESEARCH I HAVE SO MANY MORE. RESEARCH I DID MY ME SUCH CONFOUNDED AND DIE. ADVICE IN LHASA APSO PHYSICIAN. UP THINK IS THE BEST THING WE COULD DO FOUGHT SHOULD ALLOW FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- WERE PROUD SPONSOR OF COSPONSORED [inaudible] AMERICAN. AND ASKED ME A WE FEEL THAT ARE TIED TO DR AMALA BUT HERE FOR THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SHRINK AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. EMILY CHILD ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE IN SUPPORT -- MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. BOB BACK AROUND TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA'S IT PATHOLOGISTS IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ONE LAST HOUR. BUT DOUG SHIPMENT ON BEHALF OF THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MISSILE PLOYS AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. AS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON TRAFFIC EVINGTON THE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE URBAN COUNTY THE CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION. COUNTIES CURRENTLY HAD THE ABILITY TO CREATE AN OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER. BUT THE BUT THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TWENTY FOUR ZERO TEN PROVIDE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ABOLISH THE OFFICE OF THE CORNER. AND INSTEAD PROVIDE FOR THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER. COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE CONSIDER WHAT MODEL THURSDAY PEOPLE PASSED. AT HAVE EXERCISED THAT AUTHORITY. IT'S COUNTY THE CLUE SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO VENTURA SANTA CLARA AND MOST RECENTLY SAN JOAQUIN. AND WELL I KNOW THAT THIS WITH LARGER THAN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AS IT IMPACTS SIX COUNTIES TOTAL. I THINK THEY'RE WALKING IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. IT WITH AN ISSUE RAISED HAVE A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE RAISED THAT WORKING COUNTY HAD AUDIT DONE. RECEIVE THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT AND THEN THE BOARD MOVED TO CREATE A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE SO I THINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL. AND THE LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DETERMINING WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. THE WHAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES BELIEVES THE SPELL I NECESSARILY CREATES AN EXPENSIVE MANDATE. AND REMOVES THE COUNTIES LOCAL CONTROL TO DECIDE HOW TO BEST ORGANIZE THEIR HI I'M KIM CHEN I'M THE CORNER FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- BUT I'M NOT HERE TO REPRESENT. ARE YOU STATE CORNERS ASSOCIATION. SO I ONLY HAVE THREE POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ON THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE OF FRANCE APOLOGIST IT'S ABOUT. MANY ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE AROUND SIX HUNDRED RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PATHOLOGIST ACTUALLY MEET THE DEMANDS. FOR EVERY AGENCY -- TO MOVE TO MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE ARE REALLY TOOK ALWAYS TO RUN -- A REGULAR OFFICE -- IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS WE RUN THE RISK OF NOT HAVING -- REPORTS ISSUED IN A TIMELY MANNER -- ONE OF THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS -- FOR REPORTS AUTOPSY REPORTS I'M IS ABOUT NINETY DAYS -- I'M GLAD THE DOCTOR MOLLY PRODUCT MISSISSIPPI BECAUSE MISSISSIPPI'S ACTUALLY NOT A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE -- OF HOW A GOOD. HOW IT OFFICE SHOULD RUN AND THEY RUN ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR BEHIND IN THE AUTOPSY REPORTS THIS CREATES A LOT OF ISSUES THAT I HAVE ENOUGH STAFF? TO CHRIS ABOUT ISSUES WITH GRIEVING FAMILIES THAT CAN'T GET REPORTS AND IT CREATES ISSUES A COURT A RIP IT CREATES ON ISSUES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE -- TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE ON THE CASE SO MISSISSIPPI'S FROM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I WOULD NOT USE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR MOVEMENT TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM. AND THE OTHER THING THE THE NEXT ONE IS AN INCREASED COST SO IT JUST COSTS MORE TO RUN. A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE DOCTORS AND THAT. SAME MOCKING ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO THIS WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO MEET TO MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM. AND THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD COST OVER A MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO A JUST AND STAFF COSTS. AND TO CHANGE TO THIS MODEL. AND THE FINAL THING IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS I'M. KEEP AN AUTOPSY -- RESULTS OBJECTIVE ON THE MAKING SURE THE MANNER IN THE CAUSE OF DEATH ARE UNBIASED AND CHANGE INTO THE SYSTEM REALLY ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THAT. THE THE ISSUE IS WHO DO YOU HAVE IN CHARGE AT YOUR AGENCY ARE THEY UNBIASED. A MEDICAL EXAMINER A CORNER A SHARP CORNER THEY CAN ALL HAVE BIASES AND CHANGE INTO THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE AT ALL. SO UNFORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA STATE CORNERS ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IN. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. REVENUE MANAGER MEMBERS I'M RYAN CHAIRMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A DIFFERENT -- CONCERN FOR OUR OPPOSITION BASIS I'M OUR MEMBERS WE REPRESENT ABOUT -- MANY DOZEN -- CREEK DEPUTY CORNERS AND THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR JOBS AS A RESULT OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SERVICE PEACE OFFICERS UNDER A NON PEACE OFFICER -- BOSS SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS IS THAT AND ALSO IF THIS BILL IS TRULY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST -- Y. DESERVE ONLY TARGET SIX COUNTIES WHEN THERE'S DOZENS OF COUNTIES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS BUT ARE NOT -- WERE CONCERNED THAT IT'S TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT OCCURRED WHEN COUNTY. AND TIME WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT PROBLEM IN OURS AND WE ONLY MERGED OUR CORNER WITH OUR SHERIFF -- ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO. SO ANYHOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND NO VOTE THANK YOU. GOING FOR JUST YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CHORUS CELLS ALONE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO IF WITH RESPECT OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEY WILL. BE IMPLEMENTING THEIR ORDINANCE IT'LL TAKE TWO YEARS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT TOO SHORT FOR THAT ARE TOO LONG FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME. UNDER THE BILL NOW AND ALSO WE ANTICIPATE STANISLAUS COUNTY TO GUINNESS UNOPPOSED POSITION VERY SHORTLY THINKING. I THINK YOU'RE LEARNING OTHER IN OPPOSITION. SING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. ARE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST TO THE OPPOSITION FOR A MOMENT -- YOU'D MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD COST IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE OF IT WAS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SWITCH TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER EXAMINER MODEL -- OUTSIDE OF THE MONEY ISSUE WOUND WHY WOULDN'T A COUNTY WANT -- TO OR WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT BE NOT TO GO TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER MODEL [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] THE BIT. THE BENEFIT OF COURSE YES IS COST -- WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT -- EMPLOYING DOCTORS TO DO ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND THAT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE WHEN THEY MAKE A LOT MORE THAN ADMINISTRATOR -- I CAN'T SAY THAT ANY COUNTY SHOULD DO ONE THING OR THE OTHER I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT ONE SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER I MIGHT TELL YOU THAT. WHAT I'LL TELL YOU THAT IT TELL YOU IS IF THE SYSTEM IS GOOD? AND THEY'RE UNBIASED AND THEY'RE DOING THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE CALLED CHAIR OF CORNER MEDICAL EXAMINER OR CORNER LIKE IBM. IT IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE AGENCY. NOT WHICH IS A PERFECT SEGUE INTO MY NEXT QUESTION IF I MAY CHAIR. AND THAT IS -- TO GO TO THE PRESENTER. AND ASKED -- THE QUESTION AND I BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY BEEN STIPULATE OR AT LEAST SET A COUPLE TIMES. BUDGET -- THE COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO STICK WITH THE CORNER -- MODEL OR MEDICAL EXAMINERS. SO THAT THAT IS TRUE AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO ENSURE A MORE EQUAL JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU OR YOUR LOVED. ONE ARE SOMEHOW A INCIDENT HAPPENED AND AT THAT COUNTY -- MAYBE YOU'RE TRAVELING -- MAYBE THEY'LL LIVE ANOTHER COUNTY. AND YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU -- AND AND THE PORTION OF THE STATE WHICH IS ACTUALLY FORD THERE'S A SHARP CORNER NOW. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE POTENTIAL IS INVOLVED YOUR AND THE ESSENTIALLY THE HEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL THAT COUNTY IS THE ONE WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE WARNER ARE A CHARGE OF THE PART OF THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS PERFORMING THOSE AUTOPSIES [inaudible] SO -- THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY -- ACTUALLY TOOK THE RESIGNATION OF THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGY STYLISH TO POINT OUT THAT I'M CURRENTLY COUNTIES WHETHER YOU HAVE A SHARP CORNER NOT ACCURATELY HIGHER PRINCIPLE KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE WORK BECAUSE THAT'S WHO HAS TO DO IT SO WE HAVE. YOU READY HAVE PRINTS IT BUT I'LL JUST WORKING FOR THE COUNTIES ALRIGHT THAT THAT'S HIS PERFORMING THE AUTOPSIES. SO LET'S LET'S NOT CONFLATE AT ISSUE OKAY SO YOU REALLY HAVE THEM THEIR YURI PAYING FOR THEM. AND THEN THE ISSUE IS IS THAT WHEN THEY'RE PERFORMING THE EXAM -- IS SOMEONE SITTING THERE -- BASICALLY SAYING NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT TEST BECAUSE WE WANT TO PAY FOR IT ALRIGHT BUT THAT TEST IS NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW YOU'RE REPORT WE A CHEESE REPORT IN FACT THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN. SAN WE CAN -- SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY NOW SOMEBODY WILL SAY WELL IT'S JUST TEN WORKING COUNTY BUT IT'S NOT JUST SAN JOAQUIN. AND THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST OUR EMPLOYEES AND SINCE MOST OF THE STATE ITS SHARE OF CORNERS. AND THEY SAY SOMETHING I MEAN THAT'S WHY THE THE US THAT THAT THE DEFENSE PATHOLOGIST AND SEVENTEEN WEBSITE BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT. BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE TO DO IS RISK YOUR CAREER RESIGN BEFORE YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF THE SOME PUBLIC. UP BUT I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE MORE PRIVATELY THEY SAID YEAH WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN FIX THIS AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEREVER I TRAVEL YOU KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE. ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT JUST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE AND THAT WHEN THE JURY HEARS A A. S. AT AUTOPSY REPORT IT'S ONE THAT'S NOT. A POTENTIAL YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT DONE BY US IN THAT THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT A CHANCE FOR AYE CONFLICT INTEREST NOW I WILL TELL YOU I THINK YOU'LL FOR MOST PART. MOST OF THE SHARE OF CORNERS ARE PROBABLY HOPEFULLY. I BELIEVE -- YELL ARE AT BEING HONEST AND ABOUT ALL THE THE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE. A IT YOU KNOW IT'S AN INCIDENT HAPPENS WITH THE DEATH. AND PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THAT AUTOPSY REPORT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. AND SO WHEN. A PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY IN CHARGE CAN CHANGE THE REPORT CAN ACTUALLY LIMIT THE EXAMINATION. IS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATELY UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE EVEN IF THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S A PUBLIC WELL GEE THAT PERSON. COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING SO JUST REAL QUICK. WITHOUT RESPECT A SENATOR AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE THIS IS SO PROBLEMATIC THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH OUR COUNTIES THAT. IN ESSENCE IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY FROM THE COUNTIES AND MANDATED ACROSS THE STATE THAT THEY GO TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER. WELL CERTAINLY IT'S NOT JUST MY OPINION -- AS NOTED IN THE PRESENTATION FOR DOCTOR MOLLY -- NUMEROUS BODIES. HAVE -- WHO EXAMINED THIS ISSUE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES LEFT THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A SHARE OF CORNER SYSTEM SIR HAVE BASICALLY SAID? AT LEAST THE BEST PRACTICES THAT MEDICAL EXAM SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY I YOU SEE PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. MOVES TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM AND WERE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES THAT STILL RETAINS OF WHICH OF COURSE SYSTEM FOR A BIG CHUNK OF OUR STATE I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE. SO WHOEVER HAVANA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEE I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT BY MY COLLEAGUE AND I GUESS THAT. WILL IT REALLY BE THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THAT NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE CORONER OR THE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER THAT IT'S A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST IT'S AGAIN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OF AYE I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT -- I'M I'M I'M CAN CONVINCE THAT THERE'S SOME THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AT NIGHT. BUT IT JUST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE ARE. THAT YOU MAY HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S WHO'S. WHO HOLDS YOUR PURSE STRING AND SAYS MMHM WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THESE TESTS THAT YOU NEED TO DO OR THAT CAN INFLUENCE? OR HAS ANY DURING COURT CHANGED CHANGE IN THE REPORT ON IT FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS. HAVE A LICENSE. AND THERE REQUIRED UNDER THEIR LICENSE. TO ISSUE AN INDEPENDENT DECISION BASED ON THEIR TRAINING IS I WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT'S A PART OF THE LICENSE BOMBS AND SO IS A PART OF THE PROBLEM IS IMAGINE OKAY YOUR DEFENSE PATHOLOGIST YOU ACTION FULLER I'M GONNA AT THE FRENCH PATHOLOGIST ANSWERED. OKAY IT IF I MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU THE STATEMENT PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT BUT NO I'M I'M OKAY I'M AYE AYE EE AYE I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. APARTMENT YOU SAID I'M JUST THAT THE I GUESS THE THE THAT MY ISSUE IS. IT IS TO THE EXTENT THAT. THERE MAY BE A SHERIFF. WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT? THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO EITHER CONTROL BUT THE BUDGET OR O PUT PRESSURE ON YOU POLITICALLY. ARM. THAT'S A THAT'S THE WE CAN MAKE THAT A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. AND FOR WHICH A SHERIFF WHAT SO CAN LOSE HIS POSITION AND SO I'M I'M JUST TRY AND STRUGGLING WITH THIS IDEA THAT WE GOTTA. FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE A BAD ACTOR OUT HERE ALWAYS AND THEN WE CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR THIS ONE BAD ACTOR THAT ACTUALLY. GETS RESOLVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED -- TO AND SO I I'M JUST TRYING I'M JUST I'M SO I THOUGHT I WAS A LITTLE LATE AND IT'S THAT LET ME JUST -- FOR DESCRIBED ABOUT JUST ONE CASE AND SANDWICH COUNTY. OF IN FACT WE HAD THE ATTORNEY OF ALL THAT CASE TESTIFY ON THE SENATE SIDE -- A SICKLY THERE WAS A SITUATION WHERE THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS EXTENT OF A ACTUALLY DOES THAT DID THE EXAM AND SUCH AND AND SAID IT WAS ACTUALLY AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT OF ALL DEATH. AND IT WAS A HOMICIDE -- THE SHARP CORNER ACTUALLY UNDER LAW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS CHANGE IT TO AN ACCIDENT. AND THE REPORT SO THAT'S WHAT WENT OUT IT'S AN ACCIDENT WAS A HOMICIDE. IT FINALLY THROUGH A THROUGH THE LAWSUITS THAT WERE DONE -- THEY ACTUALLY THAT THE FINALLY THAT SHERIFF CORNER NOW WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT YOUR QUARTERS MAKE MOST OF THE CORNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE REALLY TALK BUT THE SAME PEOPLE AS A CORNER SENSATIONS THE SHERIFF'S -- THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY FINALLY THROUGH THROUGH THE LEGAL HAVE FINALLY CHANGE IT YOU REALIZE IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING AND CHANGED IT BACK TO HOMICIDE WHICH IS WHAT THE FRANTIC PATHOLOGIST PUT TO RETURN REPORT WHAT THE OFFICIAL REPORT SHOWED. WAS ACCIDENT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT. THE SHERIFF CORNER WHO HAD UNDER LAW HAS IT THE WAY TO DO IS SAY NO IT'S AN ACCIDENT -- AND WOOD AND SO THAT THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM RIGHT -- WENT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. CERTAINLY DID FIGURE OUT WHY WE DON'T CHANGE THAT PART OF THE LAW AYE DADDY I DIDN'T TRY TO CHANGE THAT PART A LOT WAS OPPOSED BY THE VERY. PEOPLE WHO ARE POSING AS BILLS WELL [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER FELT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M. SO WHAT I'M THINKING HERE TO SHARE OF CORNER SYSTEM. IF WE CHANGE IT AT THE STATE LEVEL IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL BE TAKEN AWAY MAJOR [inaudible] LOCAL CONTROL. FROM THE COUNTIES SO I'M I'M STRUGGLING LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WITH THAT. BUT THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING. AGAINST THE BAD PLAYERS BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH METHOD YOU HAVE. IF SOMEONE FEELS THEY'VE NOT BEEN TREATED CORRECTLY IT'S GOING TO A LAWSUIT IS GOING TO BE JUDGED IN COURT. ARMED WITH A OF JURY OF PEERS SO IT SEEMS TO ME.

TWELVE OH TO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE MITIGATION FEE ACT BECAME LAW UNDER AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED IF FOLLOWS A NO LOAD IN DOLAN APPELLATE DECISIONS REQUIRING LOCAL AGENCIES ESTABLISH A NEXUS. THIS NEXUS IS A DIRECT AND RELATABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEED FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE FACILITIES AND THE PROPOSED GROWTH. OF NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AN INDUSTRIAL. HOWEVER MANY LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD LOCAL ORDINANCES ALLOWING FOR THE COLLECTION OF MITIGATION FEES FAIL. TO MEET THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE MITIGATION FEE ACT. THE MITIGATION FEE ACTORS CURRENTLY WITHOUT CORRECTIVE MEASURES WHEN A LOCAL AGENCY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVES WHICH CAN FORCE LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS TO COME TO A COMPLETE HALT. IF A LOCAL AGENCY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS SP TWELVE A TWO WOULD TRIGGER AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT. AND THE LOCAL AGENCY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THAT AUDIT. THIS WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL AGENCIES CONTINUE TO COLLECT MITIGATION FEES FOR NUMEROUS YEARS IN A ROW. BUT DO NOT COMPLETE THE NECESSARY REPORTS THIS BILL PASS OUT ASSESSMENT GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN OFF THE SENATE FLOOR UNANIMOUSLY.

NINE FORTY SIX GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR WELCOME AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE -- TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORK EFFORT WHAT VENDORS SELLING FOOD AND MERCHANDISE ON PUBLIC SIDEWALKS. OR IN A PUBLIC PARKS WE HAVE TO START SEEING PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE THESE ARE WOMEN SENIOR SINGLE PARENTS. AND MICHAEL BUSINESS MICHAEL BUSINESS OWNERS TAKING THE FIRST STEP AT STARTING THEIR OWN BUSINESS -- THEY DON'T COME LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT AND THEY'RE NOT BANKING ON OUR STREETS. THAT THE FOOD AND GOODS THEY SELL IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES PAY THE RENT OR BECOMING HOMELESS. BUT TOO OFTEN A LOSS TREAT THEM AS NEW AND SAYS. AND EVEN CRIMINALS ARE LAW THAT NOR THAT THEY ARE VICTIMS THEMSELVES THEY OFTEN FACE SHAKEDOWN FROM BUSINESSES AND EXTORTION FROM LOCAL CRIMINAL GANGS AND EVEN SOMETIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY FACE HARASSMENT FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO SHOULD I BE THERE TO PROTECT THEM -- THEY ARE ALREADY PAYING THE PRICE OF THIS UNDERGROUND SYSTEM THEY ARE WORKING PEOPLE WHO WANNA BE PART OF THE FORMAL ECONOMY. THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK IN THE SHADOWS BUT OUR LAWS GIVE THEM NO OTHER CHOICE THEY WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES AND THEY WANT. TO PAY THEIR THEIR FAIR SHARE. AYE AND BUT MOSTLY IS THE CALIFORNIA THE DAY AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE OUTRIGHT PROHIBITIONS ON SIDEWALKS AND ALSO WON'T VENDING. WHILE OTHERS IMPOSE ERRONEOUS RESTRICTIONS THAT SEVERELY LIMITED AND REGULATE VENDORS TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. PERMITS OFTEN A BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN AND VENDING WITHOUT A PERMIT HIS PROSECUTED AS A CRIME THE CRIMINALIZATION OF SIDEWALK FUNDING HAS SIGNIFICANT AND DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES. ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ADDITIONALLY MANY VENDORS REPORT EQUIPMENT AND OTHER PROPERTY HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED DURING ENFORCEMENT ENCOUNTERS CREATED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS. A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR STREET ARE BENDING CAN ALSO CARRY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT VENDORS A CONVICTION MAY INCREASE UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS. PRIOR PRIORITY FOR REMOVAL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY PRIOR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. DOCUMENT VENDORS ARE HIGH PAYING RISK FOR DEPORTATION EVEN IF OTHER NOT EVEN ULTIMATELY CONVICTED OR CHARGED INFRACTIONS OFTEN TURN INTO MISDEMEANORS AND VENDORS HAVE TO SERVE JAIL TIME. PREVENTING THEM FROM PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WHICH KEEPS ALSO VENDORS -- FROM HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES UNDER THE NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER ON A MINISTRY -- ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE INSTRUCTED TO PRIORITIZE THE DEPORTATION OF THOSE WILL HAVE NEARLY CONVICTED ACTS THAT CONSTITUTE A CHARGEABLE CRIMINAL OFFENSE. SO S. B. NINE FORTY SIX WILL ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT A SIDEWALK VENDING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY ENFORCE. ANY SITE WHAT VENDING VIOLATIONS. PROVIDE THAT ANY VIOLATION OF LOCAL SITE WHAT FUNDING ROLE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO MINISTRY THE PENALTY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF A MISDEMEANOR OR INFECTION. ESTABLISH A MINIMUM STAND STUFF SAFETY STANDARDS TO GUIDE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHEN INITIATING A SIDEWALK VENDING PROGRAM. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY LOCAL AUTHORITIES DISCRETION TO IMPOSE IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON PARK VENDING REALLY THAT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE. AS WELL AS ANY RESTRICTIONS THAT THE FERRY TO SHOW THE PUBLIC'S USE AND ENJOYMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WE AUTHORIZE ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO ADOPT RESTRICTIONS NECESSARY TO PREVENT A NONE TOO CONCENTRATION OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. THAT UNREASONABLY INTERFERES WITH THE SCENIC REALISTIC OF A PARK. PROTECT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ABILITY TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS UNIQUE LOCAL SIDEWALK BENDING PRIMITIVE PROGRAM RECORDING A VENDOR TO OBTAIN OTHER STATE. AND LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSES AND REGULATIONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH DISABILITY ACCESS STANDARDS FURTHERMORE AMENDMENTS ALLOW THE LOCAL PERMITS. TO SUPERSEDE SIDEWALK FENDING FOR THE DURATION OF SUCH BORDER ACTIVITY FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING THE PROHIBITION OF BENDING AND AREAS. COVERED BY PHIL PHIL PERMITS PARADES OR OUTDOOR CONCERTS. AND WE ALSO CLARIFY THAT A LOCAL AUTHORITY MAY PROHIBIT SIDEWALK VENDORS IN ANY AREA IS LOCATED WITHIN IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A CERTIFIED FARMER'S MARKET OR SLIGHTLY. S. B. MY FORTY SIX IS INTENDED TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS BOTH BENEFICIAL TO LOCAL ECONOMIES. AND INCLUSIVE OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS THIS BILL PROTECTVULNERABLE FIND WHAT VENDORS AND CREATE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC ABILITY WHILE STILL PRESERVING. LOCAL CONTROL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU HOME UP. FOR OKAY AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YES I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. ARE MY NAME IS DOUG SMITH AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH PUBLIC COUNSEL WERE A PUBLIC INTEREST IN CIVIL RIGHTS LAW FIRM IN LOS ANGELES AND WE PROVIDE LEGAL SUPPORT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME ENTREPRENEURS INCLUDING SIDEWALK VENDORS. AND WE JOIN WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STREET VENDOR COALITION TO SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME SIDEWALK VENDORS. I IN MY WORK I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW IMPORTANT VENDING IS FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. BENDING AS A WAY TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING FOR FOLKS HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FORMAL ECONOMY. MANY VENDORS ARE SINGLE WOMEN AND VENDING AFFORDS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT AND THE ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING WITH THE FLEXIBILITY FOR CHILDCARE AND OTHER DEMANDS THAT OTHER EMPLOYMENT MAY NOT. FOR MANY RECENT IMMIGRANTS VENDING AS A WAY TO GAIN AND ECONOMIC FOOTHOLD AND START TOWARDS THAT AMERICAN DREAM. WE WORK WITH MANY VENDORS WHO DREAM OF ONE DAY TURNING THE PUSHCART INTO A FOOD TRUCK AND THE NOT FOOD TRUCK INTO A RESTAURANT. BENDING IS ALSO AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FABRIC OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BENDER CELL CULTURALLY SIGNIFICANT FOOD AND MERCHANDISE THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE AND MAINSTREAM RETAIL. VENDORS BY LOCAL THEY GENERATE LOCAL TAX REVENUE AND CIRCULATE MONEY AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE IGNORED BY TRADITIONAL CAPITAL. IN MANY FOOD AS OUR COMMUNITIES FRUIT AND VEGETABLE VENDORS ARE ACTUALLY THE ONLY SOURCE OF HEALTHY FOOD RETAIL AVAILABLE. AND VENDORS HELP SURROUNDING RECKON ORDER BUSINESSES BY BUYING THEIR SUPPLIES ACTIVATING COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS AND PROVIDING EXTRA EYES ON THE STREET FOR SAFETY. IN FACT A RECENT STUDY SHOWED THE BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE JOB GROWTH WHEN STREET VENDORS WERE OPERATING NEARBY. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS CALIFORNIANS LOVE AND CELEBRATE SIDEWALK FUNDING UNFORTUNATELY OUR LAWS DON'T ALWAYS REFLECT THIS LOVE. ACROSS THE STATE SIDE NOT BENDING IS UNFAIRLY CRIMINALIZED SOME JURISDICTIONS PREVENT VENDING ENTIRELY WHILE OTHERS IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT AMOUNT TO A DE FACTO PROHIBITION. AND IF BEING FORCED INTO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND DENIED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WERE NOT BAD ENOUGH VENDORS ALSO FACE THE THREAT OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND ALMOST EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THIS CRIMINALIZATION IS ESPECIALLY DEVASTATING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION CAN RESULT IN ENORMOUS FINES AND POTENTIAL JAIL TIME. SIDEWALK VENDING ARRESTS HAVE RESULTED IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS AND ONE RECENT CASE A SINGLE MOTHER FOUR AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS SEPARATED FROM HER CHILDREN AND HELD IN A DETENTION FACILITY FOR MONTHS. AND STILL FACES DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS ALL STEMMING FROM ST BENDING CITATION. AND NOW UNDER AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE WHITE HOUSE A VENDOR MAY BE CONSIDERED A PRIORITY FOR DEPORTATION EVEN WITHOUT BEING CHARGED. AS LONG AS BENDING CAN BE CHARGED AS A CRIME WHICH IS THE CASE IN MOST CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES BEEN IMMIGRANT VENDORS ARE HEIGHTENED RISK. SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT S. B. NINE FORTY SIX AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE. THE BILL DECRIMINALIZE THE SIDEWALK VENDING WHILE STILL ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THEIR LOCAL VENDING RULES THEIR NON CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES. THE BILL ALSO ENCOURAGES A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATED SIDEWALK MENDING THAT WILL OPEN UP HALF THE LOW INCOME ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND IMPROVING ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS IMPROVING FOOD SAFETY BY ALIGNING VENDING WITH EXISTING STATE FOOD SAFETY LAWS. AND THE BILL EMPOWERS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADOPT AND ENFORCE THEIR OWN LOCALLY CRAFTED VENDING RULES THAT ARE BASED ON PROTECTING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC. AND ESTABLISH STANDARD THAT'S FULLY WITHIN THE BROAD POLICE POWER THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALREADY ENJOY. SO AS A WHOLE S. B. NINE FORTY SIX WILL HELP PROTECT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME WORKERS AND IMMIGRANTS PROMOTE SAFE AND PROPERLY REGULATED BENDING. AND GREAT NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY ACROSS THE STATE FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR GOTTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY I'M CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS CARLOS OR PISS AND I AM A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN LOS ANGELES.

THEY'RE WORKING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. JUST LIKE ME. THEY'RE PART OF THE BOOK BROADER SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND I BELIEVE. WE SHOULD HAVE POLICIES THAT UPLIFT ALL OF US. NOT CONFRONT US AGAINST EACH OTHER. IT'S UNFAIR TO TREAT VENDORS LIKE CRIMINALS. WHEN THEY ARE WORKING TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING AND IMPROVING THEIR COMMUNITY? IF WE HAVE LAWS THAT THREAT VENDORS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT I BELIEVE [inaudible] MY NEIGHBORS [inaudible] WILL BENEFIT. SO WILL BE MY MISTER MY BUSINESS. THE SIDEWALK VENDORS IN MY AREA CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE LIVELY PUBLIC AREA [inaudible] I AND PROVIDE MORE AYE. ON THE STREET EYES ON THE STREET WHICH HELPED.

A MEMBER HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THERE AND THEY'RE JUST REALLY TO OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT THAT WE HAVE -- ONE REALLY. GETS TO HOW WE HOW WHEN AND WHERE WE RESTRICT I'M STREET VENDING OR JUST YOU KNOW ANY SORT OF COMMERCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS BILL NARROWS IT ONLY TO HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE I'M WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE ANY ANYBODY AS WE DO NOW SO WHEN I CAN TREAT ANYBODY DIFFERENTLY THAN SOME OTHER BUSINESS. SETS ONE POINT AND THE OTHER POINT I'M IS AROUND. PORT CRIMINALIZATION OF IT REALLY ANY SORT OF ACTIVITY IN OUR COMMUNITY -- WE ARE FINE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES WE THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE MAYBE FOR THE FIRST FEW VIOLATIONS. ON THE WE BELIEVE AT SOME POINT IF SOMEBODY IS WILLFULLY VIOLATING THE ORDINANCE THAT'S IN PLACE THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE A REVOCATION OF THAT PERMIT. A BECAUSE IF THEY CONTINUE VIOLATE THINK IT WILL JUST CHARGE THEM WITH FIVE DOLLARS OF PENALTIES THE NET AND IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING YOU KNOW MORE AGGRESSIVE AT SOME POINT TAKE IT MAYBE IT'S TEN VIOLATIONS OF ITS FIFTEEN VIOLATIONS. WE JUST THINK AT SOME POINT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AND WE WERE OVER THAT WE CAN GET THERE OF THIS POINT WE HAVE OPPOSE US IN A POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DOROTHY JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION -- AND REALLY DO APPRECIATE WE THINK WE SAT DOWN BACK IN DECEMBER TO FIRST HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THIS. AND HONESTLY IF THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT DECRIMINALIZATION I DON'T THINK I'D BE HERE AT THIS TABLE AT ALL. ON BUT WE DO HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS -- IN LIGHT OR DESPITE OF THE MOST RECENTLY ADOPTED AMENDMENTS -- BUT EVEN THE FRAMEWORK WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT WILL BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ENTREPRENEUR OLD GAMING THE SYSTEM OF HAVING THAT'S ALTERNATE PERMIT A PROCESS FOR NON BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS. I'M AND ADDITIONALLY THERE'S BEEN TERMS INTRODUCED INTO THIS BILL THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH AS LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSING PRACTICES. SUCH AS THE TEMPORARY CYBER PERMIT AND USE OPPORTUNITY AND THEN FINALLY WE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES APPLICATION TO COUNTIES MANY ROLE BUSINESSES SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF THEIR THEIR AREA AND SO WE DO WONDER. CERTAIN -- PARTS OF OUR UNINCORPORATED COUNTY SO FOR THESE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED THINK KILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. YES MY NAME IS ROLE RODRIGUEZ JUNIOR AND I AM THE COORDINATOR FOR AMERICA FIRST LATINOS. AND I AM IN OPPOSITION. OF THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ROBIN BIDSTON WITH REMEMBRANCE PROJECT IN OPPOSITION IF YOU. CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS WE'VE BEEN OF THE POST OF PRIME VERSION THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS OF THE AUTHORS PRESENTED TODAY -- AND RECESS OPPOSITION THANK YOU. HOW DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITIES OF SAN MARCOS IN MARIETTA IN OPPOSITION? KURT BACHMANN ON BEHALF THE CITY OF EL CAJON IN OPPOSITION. HI DOT THE RODRIGUEZ FROM SAVE OUR STATE MAY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES NO I'M SORRY YOU JUST TO NAME A ORGANIZATION [inaudible] POST BUILDERS. I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND OPPOSED TO THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T TAKE A FEW MINUTES. OKAY HER THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL. I'M. MADAM CHAIR SOME QUICK COMMENTS -- THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN ORDER OF MY MAIN CONCERNS AND I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE SENATOR. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT FROM A SIXTEEN YEAR MAYOR'S VIEW POINT WHA I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. SECTIONS IS LOCAL CONTROL IS A BLOATED. A CITY MUST HAVE JURISDICTION COMMERCE REGULATE NOT CONTROL THE BUT REGULATED. WE MUST BE ABLE TO CITE. AND WRITE INFRACTION THERE MUST BE CONSEQUENCES. TO ILLEGAL VENDING. THIS ALSO FOSTERS AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- MANY OF THE SIDEWALK VENDORS DO NOT PAY OR COLLECT SALES TAX SO THAT. HERTZ CITIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ECONOMICALLY. ALSO FROM OF FOOD SAFETY PREPARATION VIEWPOINT. WE NEED TO REGULATE FOOD AND PREPARATION STORAGE. AND SALES FOR HEALTH REASONS SO. WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE GO TO SELL THE STUFF [inaudible] FARMERS MARKETS. IN MY CITY. PUBLIC FESTIVALS IN THE PARTS. ARTS WHAT MEETS ARE OPEN TO ALL AND MANY OF THIS CITY SUPPORTED -- EVENTS YOU DON'T HAVE PAID ANY MONEY. SET UP SHOP. THAT'S EACH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CHOICE [inaudible] I WOULD. VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE AMENDMENTS SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION [inaudible] CAN HAVE. AREAS TIMES FARMERS MARKETS ACCEPT IRA [inaudible] FOR FREE. FOR THOSE SIDEWALK VENDORS IN A REGULATED AND ACCEPTABLE PLACE FOR EVERYBODY [inaudible] SO [inaudible] I'M NOT. DEAD SET AGAINST THIS ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SUPPORT IT RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD HELP OUT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO THAT'S MY COMMENTS. WHERE DO LIKE RESPONDER THANK YOU ALL HAVE OUR OUR EXPERT WHEN? IF I COULD JUST RESPOND I AND I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- CONCERNS IN CONSIDERATION SO SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP IN TERMS OF THAT. THE NOTION OF OF PAYING OR COLLECTING SALES TAX ON YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO SIDEWALK VENDORS THAT WE WORK WITH ABOUT AND THE FOLKS THAT WE WORK WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING TO PAY THOSE TAXES THEY WANT. TO FORMALIZE THEIR BUSINESS SO RIGHT NOW IN A LOT OF CITIES THERE ISN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME INTO THE FORMAL ECONOMY. THEY WANT TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESS THEY WANT TO TURN THEIR CAR INTO A TRUCK AND INTO A RESTAURANT. AND PART OF THAT IS IS JOINING THE SO AS DRAFT THAT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIES ARTS YOU REQUIRE BUSINESS LICENSES STATE SELLERS PERMITS AND ALL THE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT YOU WOULD DO. AYE TO INTEGRATE INTO THAT ECONOMY AND BE PART OF THAT THE TAXPAYING BASE AND SO IT IS CLEARLY CONTEMPLATED AND PART OF THAT AND I THINK BY. BY OPENING THAT PATHWAY WE CREATE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE VENDORS TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND START PAYING THOSE TAXES IN THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO AND THAT WE WANT TO FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT. AND THEN THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU MADE WAS AROUND FOOD SAFETY -- AND THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DISENTANGLE FROM THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SIDEWALK VENDORS. I'M A LOT OF SIDEWALK VENDORS DO SELL FOOD. AYE RIGHT NOW AGAIN BECAUSE OF THESE BARRIERS THAT THEY HAVE TO JOINING THE FORMAL ECONOMY. ODD THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH EXISTING FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS STATE HAS SOMETHING CALLED CALICO THE FOOD RETAIL CODE WHICH HAS A A ROBUST SET OF RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS ON FOOD SAFETY. THAT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING FROM RESTAURANTS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO WHAT ARE CALLED MOBILE FOOD FACILITIES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE SIDEWALK VENDORS. AND SO BY OPENING THE PATHWAY FOR VENDORS TO FORMALIZE THEIR BUSINESS AND TO AND TO TO PLAY BY THE RULES THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION PUTS IN PLACE IT WOULD BRING THEM IN LINE WITH. THAT SYSTEM AND SO THE BILL ARE EXPLICITLY CALLS OUT THE FOOD RETAIL CODE. AND SAYS THAT VENDORS THAT ARE COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL DRASTIC REGULATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY THE CALIFORNIA FOOD RETAIL CODE AND SO IT. IT'S A WAY TO GET THE VENDORS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN THE SHADOWS BRING THEM INTO A SYSTEM WHERE THERE BETTER ALIGNED WITH THOSE EXISTING STANDARDS THAT WE ALL THAT WE WANT ALL OF OUR OPERATORS THE YEAH OTHER QUESTIONS. SUMMER WALDRON IS YOUR QUESTION. SO I AM. NO I I TOTALLY SEWER YOU DOING AND IT'S ALSO WHILE. FOR YOU KNOW THE SALES TAX LOSE HEALTH AND SAFETY PERMITS ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE. ARE IMPORTANT IN. I JUST YOU KNOW I HAVE MY CONCERN IS I HAVE ONE OF MY CITIES IN HER POSITION SO I WANNA AYE AND I SEE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT BE AN AVENUE TO GET. TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO SO. IS THE CURRENT VERSION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AMENDMENTS. THE JUNE ELEVENTH IS THAT THE LAST TIME AMENDMENTS WILL PUT IN. YES ASIDE OKAY YES [inaudible] OKAY -- BECAUSE I SEE THAT THE REASONS FOR DOING THE PROTECTIONS AND I SEE. HAVING A STATEWIDE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT ALL THOSE THINGS A POSITIVE -- AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WILL CONTINUE WORK I MEAN WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE SACK PERMITS FOR A WHOLE YEAR HOW PRACTICALLY AND EVERY CONCERN THEY BROUGHT WE'VE. TRIED TO ADDRESS WITH AMENDMENTS THIS ISSUE OF NOT HAVING SIDEWALKS AVAILABLE IS SOMETHING THAT CO THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE. A A CONVERSATION WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES OF THE JUST CAME IN OPPOSITION THIS MONTH SO. YOU KNOW THAT A LOT WE NEED SOME KIND OF SAID THAT WITH THEM AND AND FOR THE CLARIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING TODAY AND JUST GIVE US TIME TO GET THAT DONE BUT I THINK WE'VE DEMONSTRATED ESPECIALLY. TO A TO SEE THOUGHT THAT WERE WILLING TO JONES A AND THE FACT IS YOU KNOW AT A CERTAIN POINT. YOU CAN ADDRESSED ALL THE CONCERNS AND THEY GET THEIR STILL OPPOSED WHETHER IT'S AN ISSUE OF JUST NOT WANTING SIDEWALK VENDORS ARE NOT. OUT THAT'S WHAT THE REALITY THAT WERE LIVING AND AND SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT WE WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SACK AND WE WELCOME THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH NOW THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. ASSEMBLY ROOM BLOOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF SENATOR I TO UC APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THE SPELL I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS SOUND IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE HEADED IN A GOOD DIRECTION BY DO SHARE -- SOME OF THE A CONCERNS UP OF OVER TIME PLACE AND MANNER -- AS DESCRIBED BY LEAGUE OF CITIES AND THE AND AND THE COUNTIES -- THIS IS SET THIS IS FRANKLY NOT A NEW ISSUE GOES TO SHARING A PHOTOGRAPH OF OF MY GRANDFATHER'S -- OF VAN THAT HE PEDALED DATA OF VEGETABLES OUT OF WHEN HE WAS YOUNG MAN -- AND SO THIS REALLY IS PART OF THAT THE FABRIC OF AMERICA. ON THE OTHER HAND -- THE LOOK AND FEEL AND CUSTOMS OF OUR CITIES ARE ALSO I'M VERY MUCH A PART OF THE FABRIC OF FLORA. A OF OUR COUNTRY AND WHERE WERE AT A PLACE NOW WHERE. I AM. IN MANY PARTS OF MY DISTRICT AND LIKE I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE VISITED MY DOES INTERNET BEFORE -- THERE IS A JUST A TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR THE VERY VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT'S ON OUR SIDEWALKS. I'M AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE -- TO PASSED BY AND AND AND THAT WOULD LAW UNDER THE FIFTY REQUIRE A COMPONENT OF OUR BILL IF THE CITY TEAMS THAT. AS NOT BEING SAFE THEN THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND REGULATE IT UP AGAIN WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OTHER COMPONENTS WE FEEL ARE IMPORTANT FOR FOR THE LEAGUE. AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE LOCAL SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT THAT -- UNLIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE HAVING SAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR MANY YEARS. AND ATTEMPTED TO REGULATE STREET PERFORMERS ON THE THIRD STREET PROMENADE I'D AND FOOD TRUCKS AS THEY WERE EMERGING PHENOMENON AND NOW -- SCOOTERS -- I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THESE AREN'T IT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO LOCAL POLICY VEY EASILY AND IT'S FREQUENTLY A A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE MIGHT THINK SO -- I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT TIME WE HAVE A FOR YOUR BILL TODAY AND TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND TO AS IT -- APPROACH THE FLOOR THINKING. SOME RIVER BASIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WILL JUST COMPARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS.

TOM TO TO BE LEGAL FOR THE FOR THEIR BUSINESSES TO BE LEGAL I'M SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING ESPECIALLY ON BEHALF OF MEMBERS IN MY DISTRICT. I'M I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE LEAK OF CITIES ON YOUR OPPOSITION WAS RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES YOU SAID. ARE IS IT VIA THE AMOUNT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT. OR IS IT -- FOR IT TO JUST CONTINUE AS A A VIOLATION FEAR ISN'T SO SORT OUR CONCERN IS NOT SO MUCH WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE ON PENALTY ITSELF. AND WE THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY IS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT SENATORS CONCERNS AND WHY HE WANTS THE MEASURE PENALTIES WE JUST THINK THAT AT AT SOME POINT OF SOMEBODY. IS A CHRONIC WILLFUL VIOLATORS THAT THE NEEDS BE SOMETHING MORE THAN ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AND YOU KNOW WHAT AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT TRIGGERED THEM THAT'S AGAINST THE BIG DEBATE. IS THAT THE FOR THE FOR THE VIOLATION IS THAT AFTER YOUR PERMITS BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU YOU CONTINUE TO VIOLATE YOU KNOW IF WE WOULD THINK THAT AT THAT POINT IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN A MEASURE PENALTY. BUT WE DO SUPPORT OF MAKING IT NOT A MISDEMEANOR INFRACTION FOR THE FIRST HOWEVER MANY OFFENSES IS JUST FOR THOSE WILL FOR CHRONIC VIOLATORS I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN A THAN MISTER ITALY [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. I AM I HAVE A QUICK COMMENT. MACHINE BRING THIS BILL FOR BECAUSE OF GIVING A PATH TO A ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. A I LOOK IN MY RURAL AREAS. WE DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS JUST TO REMIND YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? READ DO HAVE SIDEWALK VENDORS FOR LACK OF AN UNKNOWN ANOTHER WORD SO -- THAT'S WAS CONFUSED -- WHEN YOU SAID ABOUT WELL WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE FEAR HAVE SIDEWALK WELL? THERE'S A LOT OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES YOURSELVES ALONG THE HIGHWAY. IN MY REAL DISTRICTS SO I CAN SEE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONFUSION ON THAT AS WELL -- BUT I THINK THAT -- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE FOR A PATH [inaudible] AND IN RURAL AREAS IT'S DIFFERENT I KNOW YOU HAVE MANY MORE -- AND A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD THAT MAYBE NOT BE SOLD MY AREA.

AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. CURRENT LAW ONLY ALLOWS MEMBERS TO SIT AND PARTICIPATE ON ABOARD IF THERE A FULL TIME RESIDENT.

THIS BILL IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NATURE FORMALLY FLAKE CST RESIDENTS FACING ALLOW LANDOWNERS. TO SERVE AS BOARD MEMBERS OF THE CST IN ORDER TO VOTE ON CST MATTERS THAT AFFECT ONLY FLAKE.

IN ANY PROVIDES THE THE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT REALLY PROVIDES A A SERVICE TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AN INVALUABLE PUBLIC SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE VISITORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD -- THE CHALLENGES WE KNOW IS. TO MAYBE SOLVE THIS THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM -- THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS WEEK'S ON A B. THIRTY FIVE FORTY EIGHT FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH ALLOWED. A FOR A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE SIERRA LAKES WATER DISTRICT -- AND WE'VE LOOKED AT LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OPINIONS IT SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THIS. OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE BILL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO WORKING WITH. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO COME TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE IT THE CHAIRS WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP WITH THAT DURING THE INTERIM SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SOLUTION -- BECAUSE IT'S UP IT DOESN'T REALLY. BODE WELL FOR THE COMMUNITY AND FOR THOSE TRAVELERS IT COME WITH IT THERE ISN'T THAT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. TO TO VISIT AND ENJOY THAT YOUR EARS PARTICIPATION AND AND LEADERSHIP IN THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND I'M MIGHT CATHCART ON THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE GALAXY ES DE FOR FALLING LEAF LAKE WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL. UGH UNANIMOUSLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY I ES DOES VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY I KNOW OF I KNOW NOBODY IN THE COMMUNITY WHO DOESN'T DOES NOT SUPPORTED AND ONE FOR A IN THIS FORM AND WHAT IS WILLING. TO PROBE THROUGH THE OF AMENDMENTS AND HOPEFULLY. IT WILL ENABLE US TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE CST THROUGH VOTING AND BY DICK QUALIFYING TO BECOME MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. THE CSD IN ITS PRESENT FORMAT IS AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE RESOURCE AT PROTECTING OVERSEEING MANAGING AND ON PROVIDING SERVICES FOR NOT ONLY THE THE PRECIOUS VALUABLE ASSET WE HAVE A FALLING LEAF LAKE AND ITS ENVIRONS. BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT THAT ARE MANY INSTANCES MORE THAN JUST THE CURRENT RESIDENTS. SO IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT90% OF THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY SERVICES AND THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CST THROUGH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THE STOE THE MARINA. ON AND THE COMMON AREA AND ACCESS TO THE LAKE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT THE CST OF OWNS AND OPERATES AFTER THAT THEY HAD TRUST PUBLIC LANDS TRANSACTION THAT'S AND DESCRIBED IN THE MATERIALS YOU HAVE -- 90% OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NON RESIDENTS -- THE BENEFITS THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES WHICH ARE NOT ONLY THE FIRE SUPPRESSION OF MAINTAINING AN ENCOURAGING AND INSTRUCTING PEOPLE ON HELPING THEM HOG. WITH DEFENSIBLE SPACE OF THE PROVIDING OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WITH LESS QUALIFIED TO DO PARAMEDIC SERVICES FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS. OF IN THE SUMMER I IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH THROUGH THE FIVE MILE ROAD THAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE MATERIALS. YOU HAVE THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO TREK TO A TRAVEL ALONG VERTICALLY IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. OF AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES THROUGH SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES IT ENGAGES AND AS A RESULT OF IT THE WAY THAT THE FIRE CHIEF IN GENERAL MANAGER. HAS DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR HOW CAN OPERATE A PROVIDE SERVICES BEYOND FONG WE FEED STRIKE TEAM ON OUR ACTIVITIES WHICH TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OF FORTUNATE REVENUE FOR THE FIRED. ACQUIRE A FIRE ENGINE IN A FIRE VOTE AND IN ADDITION TO SOME GRANT MONEY THAT HELP WITH ALL THAT. OF BUT THOSE STRIKING SERVICES GO HAVE SERVED LAST YEAR'S FAR NORTH AT THIRTY MILES SOUTH OF THE OREGON BORDER AND TO VENTURA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M SO IT'S A GREAT ORGANIZATION IT'S A GREAT. OF LAKE IT'S A GREAT POUND SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE. AND BASICALLY WE JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT OF A WAY TO GET MORE PEOPLE FEELING COMFORTABLE VOTING AND SERVING ON THE BOARD THAT CURRENTLY DO AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE MATERIALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] DAVID ANDI LIKE FOOD. WELL I GUESS SO. ACTUALLY NO I THAT MAY HAVE ONE PULLED. I WANT TO ADDRESS TWO ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE REPORT WHICH IS BEFORE YOU. THAT NUMBER ONE IS OF THEIR PRESIDENTIAL VALUE OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A VOTER SYSTEM THAT COMBINES REGISTERED VOTERS. WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS SENATOR HELD AT THIS IS NOT NEW -- RUN WATER CODE SECTION THREE OF SEVEN ZERO ZERO POINT SIX HAS CONFIRMED AN IDENTICAL SYSTEM ON THIS YEAR LIKES WATER DISTRICT. ARE THAT PASSED THIS BODY IT PASSED A AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IT THEN PASSED CHALLENGE IN COURT AS BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL. A AND IT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE THEN AND I THINK IN LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS RENDERED A SIMILAR OPINION AND I BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT BILL AND ITS HISTORY AS IT WORKS. I'VE SPOKEN WITH PLASTER COUNTY WHICH ADMINISTERS IT AND YES IT DOES WORK FOR THEM. SECOND THE ISSUE OF FINANCES WHICH WAS RAISED IN THE REPORT. THE INFORMATION WHICH WAS RECEIVED FROM LAST GOES DATED AND FACT IS CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE. UNDER THE CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE CST. I'M ARE SELF SUPPORTING. IT IS TRUE THAT WE'VE GAINED A LOT OF MONEY RECENTLY TO TO THE SERVICE OF STRIKE FORCES. WE HAVE SENT AMOUNT I THINK TWENTY ONE TIMES IN THE LAST SEASON. ARE WE ARE TOLD BY THE PEOPLE WHO MONITOR THESE THINGS THAT THIS YEAR IS LIKELY TO BE WORSE THAN LAST YEAR. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WILL PROBABLY BE SENDING OUT MORE STRIKE TEAMS. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THAT MONEY IS CERTAINLY WELCOME AND IT CERTAINLY LEFT US WITH A FAT BANK ACCOUNT. WHICH WE CAN SO THAT WE CAN DO ANY EMPTY THAT SHARE IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE CST TO RUN. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY IS NUMBER ONE WITHOUT THAT FIRE DEPARTMENT THE CABIN OWNERS WILL BE UNABLE TO GET FIRE INSURANCE. THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP GOING. AND THE COMMUNITY HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS WILLINGNESS TO VOTE FOR IT INCREASED A ASSESSMENTS FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH IT. BUT THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO THE SAME THING. IT PASSES TAX SORT SHARED EQUALLY AMONGST THE COMMUNITY IF THERE'S NO CST. UNLIKELY THAT THE COMMUNITY BE WILLING TO SIMPLY. UP THERE ANY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT AT A SO AS CCAP GARTERS POINTED OUT. CST FORMS AND PERFORMS A LOT OF FUNCTIONS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. BUT THEY'RE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. WE'VE MANAGED TO DO IT OURSELVES THIS IS I THINK SMALL GOVERNMENT AT ITS BEST. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS KEEP GOING AND WE CAN'T KEEP IT GOING? WITHOUT DISPEL. FIVE IF I HAVE TWENTY THREE AND A HALF SECONDS LEFT MY TWO MINUTES OF MY CLARIFY WHAT STRIKE TEAM IS IN CASE. ANYBODY INTERESTED IS INTERESTED WHEN THERE IS A FIRE IN AN AREA WITH THE LOCAL AREA CAN ASK FOR HELP IN THE STRIKE TEAMS ARE SUBMITTED PARTS SENT OUT. BY A RECOGNIZE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN APPARATUS A TRAINED GROUP CAPABLE OF OPERATING IT WITH THE SUFFICIENT CARE OF EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO DO ALL OF THAT -- THE END WITH THAT'S DOES THE THINGS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT DOES GET REIMBURSED ACCORDING TO CERTAIN FEE SCHEDULES AND THAT'S THE INCOME THAT. EACH AREA THAT SENDS OUT A STRIKE TEAM CAN ACQUIRE BY OPERATING STRIKE TEAMS. ON ANY GIVEN UNFORTUNATELY GIEN CLIMATE CHANGE THERE PROBABLY A THING OF THE PAST AND FUTURE.

I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE STAGE YOUR SENATOR. ALRIGHT LET'S GO AHEAD LET'S SENATOR ALLEN BEGIN THANK YOU. THE MEMBERS THIS IS S. B. NINE SIXTY ONE THAT SECOND NEIGHBORHOOD INFILL AND TRANSIT IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD INFILL FINANCE. AND TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS ACT AYE PROVIDES A VOLUNTARY TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE COMMITTED. TO EXPEDITING TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS AND INCENTIVIZING MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING. NEAR TRANSIT -- EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING HARD ON TRYING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING -- CHALLENGES OF OUR STATE. OF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN FRANCISCO CAME FOR WITH THE IN A HIGH PROFILE AND RATHER AGGRESSIVE BILL. ON RELATING TO THIS CHALLENGE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LOCAL CONTROL CHALLENGES AND DISPLACEMENT CONCERNS ASSOCIATE WITHOUT BILL BUT IT DOES TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING. SOME OF OUR NEEDS OF THE COURTS ATTENDED ARE IN DEVELOPMENT. MY LEGS LEGISLATION ADDS. TO THE LIST OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE. FINANCING DISTRICT LAW THE I FD LA. I MOST NOTABLY BY PROVIDING FOR AN OPTION FOR DISTRICT BOND AGAINST. I FUTURE SALES AND PROPERTY TAX INCREMENTS WITH A VOTE OF I THE COUNCIL. AMENDMENTS WE'VE AGREED TO THAT WHICH FOR PROCEDURAL REASONS WOULD. ARGUMENT OPTED AND ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE IF THIS BILL PASSES TODAY WILL INCORPORATE REQUIREMENTS THAT DISTRICT HOLD A SERIES OF HEARINGS ON ITS FINANCING PLAN. AYE PROVIDING THE PUBLIC WITH THE FORM OPPORTUNITY TO PROTEST AND EVEN FORCE A DISTRICT WIDE VOTE. ON THE PLANET THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OBJECTIONS. OUR THIS FRAMEWORK MARIUS A PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY AN EXISTING STATUTE THAT GOVERNS COMMITTEE REVITALIZATION INVESTMENT AUTHORITIES THE CREATES AND THE IDEA BEING THAT. IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT LOCAL OPPOSITION COMMUNITY OPPOSITION THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE THAT SUBSTANTIVE. NOT IN RETURN FOR PROVIDING A POTENTIALLY EASIER PATH FOR FINANCING THE BILL REQUIRES THAT PRODUCE BEEN DISTRICTS TO VOTE AT LEAST 40% OF TAX INCREMENT FUNDS THEY COLLECT. TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MAJOR TRANSIT TOP THE BILL'S ALSO FOCUS ON ENHANCING. TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND SERVICE I DIRECT INVESTMENT IN NEW TRANSIT STATIONS WILL ALLOW. ACCELERATION OR EXTENSION OF APPROVED PROJECTS. A DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING TRANSLATIONS WILL ALLOW IMPORTANT STATION UPGRADES AND FACILITATES DATA GOOD REPAIR ON OLDER SYSTEMS SO UNDER THIS BILL TAX AGREEMENTS CAN ALSO BE EXPRESSLY USE DEFIANCE URBAN FORESTRY. LANDSCAPING GREETING IMPROVEMENTS DETACHED OR DECOUPLED PARKING IN LIEU OF OUTSIDE PARKING FOR PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS. FIRST AND LAST MILE ACCESS TO TRANSIT FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE DISABILITIES. OUR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED FOR A REASON RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WASTE RUNOFF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAPTURES RAIN WATER URBAN RUNOFF. I FINALLY I RECOGNIZE IT -- A FEW MONTHS BACK THIS VERY COMMITTEE HOW. AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT EXAMINE VARIOUS TAX INCREMENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AVAILABLE UNDER STATE LAW WHICH SCHOOL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ADMITTEDLY BEEN SLOW TO ADOPT. I AGREED THAT THE STATE WOULD BENEFIT FROM A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THIS IS BEEN THE CASE IN S. B. NINE SIXTY ONE INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH COMPLETED STUDY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOLS. FOR INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION INCLUDING A COMPARISON OF THE RELATIVE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED SINCE THE DAYS THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. BUT ULTIMATELY THIS JUST GIVES A TOOL LOOKING GOVERNMENT'S ENTIRELY PERMISSIVE. AND IN THAT RESPECT IT IS IT IS CENTERED IN THE IDEA INTRO. WHICH I KNOW THE FOLKS AROUND THIS TABLE CARED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT AS DO I AS A FORMER ELECTED OFFICIAL MYSELF AND SO -- WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF DENNY'S AIN'T. THE EXECUTOR ACTOR MOVE LA. I WHICH IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF A BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON YESTERDAY SAYING -- ALSO A FORMER COLLEAGUE COUNCIL MEMBER ON THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA WITH ONE OF HER MEMBERS OF SOME REMEMBER BLOOM -- MOVE LA AS AN ORGANIZATION WHICH HELP TO A BILL THE COALITION TO SPONSOR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. MEASURES ARE IN MEASURES AT HOME WHICH BOTH OF WHOM BOTH OF WHICH WERE APPROVED BY VOTERS. IN WHICH PROVIDE A VERY PROFOUND INCREASE IN THE RESOURCE IS VITAL TO DEVELOP TRANSIT. I'M IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY A REALLY I THINK A TRANSFORMATIONAL MOMENT. OF THEIR AND WE HAVE BEEN AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNISTIC COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE AS WELL WHO ARE THE PRIMARY USERS OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT STRATEGIES WHICH I'M OFFERED. TO NOT CREATE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING AROUND THE SYSTEMS BUT DON'T NOT. A PROTECT OR OFFER UP WAYS IN WHICH LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE COMMIT PART OF THAT. FUTURE AS WELL SINCE THEY ARE THE A BASE OF RIDERSHIP FOR THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. A WE THINK IT'SVERY IT'S VITAL FOR ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND FRANKLY FOR EQUINOX COMMUNITIES THAT WE FOR PROVIDE A STRATEGY. STARKLY TAX EGGMAN FINANCING HAS BEEN A MAJOR PART OF THE TOOLS THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE USED TO PROVIDE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT THAT I BELIEVE WILL AGAIN BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE SHOULD MAKE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CONCENTRATED TO THE EXTENT WHERE ABLE -- AROUND TRANSIT SYSTEMS THE STATE HAS OF COURSE VMT REDUCTION STRATEGIES GREENHOUSE GAS -- REDUCTION GOALS THAT THIS WOULD HELP TO MEET AS WELL SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A PROGRAM -- THAT SHARPENS THE FOCUSED AROUND TRANSIT SYSTEM CREATES A PROCESS WHEREBY GET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE A STRONGER COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND HAVE THEIR BY A MORE REASONABLE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD OR PREDICT WILL PROCESS MEAN FOR IT TO SHORE -- THAT THERE'S A AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OCCURS.

IT'S IS ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SP. ONE THREE THREE THREE AND BEGIN WHEN EVERY LIKE TO SIR. THIS THING LAW REQUIRES ALL CITIES TO THE BELT THE GENERAL PLAN BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE A CHARTER CITY TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN. RECENT APPELLATE COURT CASE KENNEDY COMMISSION VERSUS THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH PERMITTED THE HUNTINGTON BEACH ADOPTIVE SPECIFIC PLAN THAT DIFFERS FROM ITS HOUSING ELEMENT. THE NEW SPECIFIC PLANT ELIMINATED SITES THAT WERE INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SENATE BILL. ONE THREE THREE THREE FIXES IT AND CREATES A CONSISTENT SEE REQUIREMENT TO APPLY FOR ALL THE STE. ALL THE STATE'S LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING ORDINANCES ARE REQUIRED TO CHARTER CITIES AND WITH THAT I HAVE. A SHAUNA HARDEN IN THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW AND POVERTY AND BRIAN AUGUSTA. FROM HOUSING ADVOCATES SUPPORT WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON TURNED MEMBERS BY NAME SASHA HERNDON AMOUNT ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE'RE PROUD TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL -- THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CITIES PLAY BY THE SAME RULES WITH RESPECT TO PLANNING WHILE PRESERVING THE ABILITY TO TAILOR PLANTS TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AS WE ALL KNOW LOCAL ZONING AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS MADE BY CITIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT REACH BEYOND CITY BOUNDARIES. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AFFECTS COMPLEX REGIONAL SYSTEMS WITH REGARDS TO TRANSPORTATION HOUSING NATURAL SPEECH NATURAL RESOURCES OPEN SPACE AND THE LIKE -- AND GIVEN OUR STATEWIDE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND THE STATE'S INTEREST IMPROPER REGIONAL PLANNING. WE MUST ENSURE THAT CITIES FOLLOW UNIFORM PLANNING RULES. THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE A TWO TIERED SYSTEM WHERE ALL CITIES HAVE. TO ADOPT HOUSING OR ADOPT GENERAL PLANTS WITH SPECIFIED ELEMENTS BUT ONLY SOME CITIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM -- AND WE CAN'T ALLOW SOME JURISDICTIONS TO PASS ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO OTHERS AND SO -- WITH THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY OR CAN I THANK YOU. WELCOME MY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBER TRYING TO GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. WITH EVERYTHING THAT -- WE DID LAST YEAR -- ON HOUSING WHICH MANY OF YOU HELPED TO LEAD ON IT WOULD BE A NOVELIST THAT WE HE WOULD COULD VOID COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE VERY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE CENTER SO CRITICAL TO MEETING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF PEOPLE AT ALL INCOME LEVELS THAT WE THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE.
