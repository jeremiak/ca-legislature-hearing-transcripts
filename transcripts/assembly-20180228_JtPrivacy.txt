ALL RIGHTS GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND. WE'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ALL THE UPDATES THIS MORNING. AND A HAPPY TO. HAVE MY CO CHAIR HERE. AS. MR CHOW WHO IS OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR OF PRIVACY AND MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO. MISTER CHAD YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS SURE ABSOLUTELY. WHEREIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. ARM I LET ME FIRST. A BEGIN BY THANKING MY CO CHAIR SOME A MEMBER IRWIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON CYBERSECURITY ISSUES AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY THROUGHOUT. OF THE LAST FEW YEARS I'D IS MY HOPE THAT OUR COMMITTEE SELL COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WILL CONTINUE TO HELP KEEP OUR STATE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT I MEAN BY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH? IS THAT DOW ONE THAT INVOLVES ALL OF THIS. FROM THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO THE FEDERAL AND TO THE LOCALS AND FROM THE PUBLIC TO THE PRIVATE. I BELIEVE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT A SILO WOULD OPPOSE CHAU. TO IT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE SUCH AS CYBERSECURITY IS NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT APPROACH. OUR AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT A REACTIONARY APPROACH IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE OPTION IN TODAY'S WORLD. WORD NEW CYBER ATTACKS ARE INEVITABLE EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE BEST SECURITY. OUR TEAMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHAT. SO OVER BOTH SOLUTIONS TO INSULATE OURSELVES IN THE MODERN WORLD. THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE CAN INCREASE OUR DETECTION CAPABILITIES. IMPROVE OUR RESPONSES AND MITIGATE THE HARMS. IN MANY RESPECTS SOME VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE STATE'S DIRECTION UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP OF DIRECTOR TO HONG. COMMANDED TRASH AND THE KELSEY SICK PARTNERSHIP. I'M ALSO EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO DATE. YET WE DON'T WANT TO BE COMPLACENT. TO THAT END MY PERSONAL GOAL TODAY AS CHAIR OF THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE IS TO ASK THE PRESENTERS. TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. FIRST WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT. TO HAVE YOUR DEPARTMENT EXPERTS FOUND ANY TOOLS THAT ARE MISSING FROM THEIR TEMPLE BOX THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. THREE ARE THERE TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE AND FOR AT THE SAME TIME WHAT OTHER CRITICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION. THAT WE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WE GRAPPLE WITH NEW POLICY QUESTIONS SURROUNDING CYBER THREATS MOVING FORWARD. WITHOUT A LOOK FOR TO OUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND. LET ME TRY BACK OVER TO MY CULTURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER URBAN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD OWE IT HAS BEEN THAT TWO YEARS SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER IN THIS FORMAT TO DISCUSS THE STATE CYBERSECURITY POSTURE AND I'M. CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO DISCUSSING ALL THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHALLAN I HAVE BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE BY THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. ESPECIALLY BY MANY OF THOSE THAT ARE LISTED TO SPEAK TODAY. CYBERSECURITY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THREATS BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR.

DESERVE IT PROMINENT POSITION AS THE CORNERSTONE OF STATE GOVERNMENT. MY VISION FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY LEADERS ABOUT THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO BRING OUR CYBERSECURITY POSTURE TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

BOB AS YOU SAID JUST TWO YEARS AGO. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE TWO YEARS AGO WITH A WORKING ON A PRETTY COLLABORATIVE AND AND I EXTENSIVE. EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS CYBER THREAT THAT WE'RE FACING AS A STATE. ARM BY DOING A COUPLE OF KEY AREAS A ONE IS BUILDING RESILIENCY AND EDUCATION WHICH. DIRECTOR TOM WILL TALK ABOUT. IN IN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN WORK THAT THIS BODY HAS ALSO HELPED US TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. OUR AND THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS BEEN BUILDING. A CYBER BY DEFENSE CAPABILITY.

CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER ARE THIS CENTER THIS INTEGRATED CENTRE. WHICH IS CO LOCATED WITH OUR STATE THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER. ARE IS YEAH IS A CENTER WHERE. WHERE? A NUMBER OF THE ENTITIES WHICH HISTORICALLY HAD BEEN DOING WORK. SORT OF INDIVIDUALLY ARE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS CYBER CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA.

OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND NON GOVERNMENTAL PARTICIPATION THIS IS A ADVISORY. SORT OF GROUP THAT COMES TOGETHER AND PROVIDES US IN GOVERNMENT IDEAS AND. INFORMATION ON BEST PRACTICES AND HELPS THE GUIDE OUR WAY WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND WE BUILD THAT IN. TO THE OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS THAT WE HAVE ARE UNDER THE CAL SICK. THAT CALCIUM. OF. YOU IN THIS LAST COUPLE YEARS EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE OF ORGANIZATIONS HERE HAVE PLUGGED PEOPLE IN FULL TIME. OF THOSE FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT THREAT STREAMS THAT ARE COMING ACROSS.

THE COAST GUARD OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AT UCC ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES UTILITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE BANKING INDUSTRY. IT'S BEEN A PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF EFFORT THAT THE TEAM MEMBERS HERE TOGETHER. WHEN I SAW TALKED TWENTY ONE FIGHT EVERYBODY WORKING ON A COMMON SET OF OBJECTIVES. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE TH THE THREAT. I'M WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PILOTED. A WHAT I WOULD CALL WHAT WE CALL A CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE MACHINE TO MACHINE FEE PROGRAM. WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT. INCOMING. AYE DATA AND AND LOOKING FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON IN THOSE STREAMS.

ELEMENTS THAT PLUGIN TO THE WAY THE STATE. OF RESPONSE TO. THESE KINDS OF THREATS. AND IT SPEAKS TO HOW OUR INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS. OUR AND OUR CYBER. PARTNERS ALL ARE LOOKING AT. A COMMON SET OF. ITEMS THREATS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS BY WHICH. CERTAIN ACTORS ARE ARE IDENTIFIED. AND WE COULD THEN BE OUT IN FRONT OF EVOLVING CRISIS NOW I WOULD JUST TELL YOU. ARE WE AT A HUNDRED PERCENT WHAT WE NEED TO BE AT NOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK THIS IS EVOLVING THREAT. IT'S CHANGING EVERY DAY WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PAVE IT AND CHANGE WITH IT. THAT MEANS THAT TO BE VERY MUCH. OF WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TRIED TO ANTICIPATE. USING WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SEE THE THREATS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD AND AND. THE PARTNERS HERE TODAY WILL WILL TAKE THE TIME TO TO TALK ABOUT THAT. ON THE BOARD HERE YOU SEE SOME OF THAT THE VARIOUS UP PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE. TIED IN WITH US AT THE REALLY THESE ARE THAT THE DATA DAY PARTNERS THAT WE'RE GETTING. AND WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH. WHERE? ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES BRING A POWERFUL SANDOVAL OF CAPABILITIES TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA. ARE IS IN A PLACE WHERE. WE WE REMAIN OUT IN FRONT OF THIS UP THIS THREAD IN DEPTH. YOU'LL ARE TODAY ABOUT SOME VERY STE VERY SIGNIFICANT ALL WINS THAT WE HAVE HAD. THAT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE HAD JUST TWO YEARS AGO IN BEING ABLE TO ENTER DECKED. US IT VERY SEVERE ARE THREATS TO THE STATE AND STATE NETWORKS. WHICH PREVENTED US AS A STATE OF FROM BEING IN A VERY. TOUGH PLACE. PRIVATE CHANGE THE OF SLIDE. THE GENERAL A SENSE OF AWE OF THE CUP OF THE CYBERSECURITY IMMIGRATION CENTER. AS YOU CAN SEE THE COR PARTNERS. AND THEN THE PARTNER AGENCIES IT IS A IT IS A A UP PUSH AND PULL SYSTEM WHERE EVERY. WHERE FEEDS OF INFORMATION ARE FLOWING IN ARE COMING INTO THE? CAL SICK EACH AND EVERY DAY AND. IF FROM LOCAL STATE PRIVATE AND FEDERAL. THAT'S VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL AND. THOSE THOSE THAT INFORMATION IS ASSESSED. EIGHT IS ASSESSED AGAINST THREATS STREAMS AND INTELLIGENCE THAT WE GET ARE FROM THE VARIOUS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO IT TO TRY TO DETERMINE. ARM WHERE THE THREATS ARE COMING FROM OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO PORTANTINO EYES. ARE AND AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SIGNATURES FROM CERTAIN. NATION STATE ACTORS THAT WERE LOOKING FOR BUT ALSO. AND THE CHALLENGES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN. INDIVIDUALS HACKTIVIST ACTIVISTS OR ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS BEING ABLE TO COME IN AND WANTED TO DO. WHETHER IT'S AS STEALING FINDS OR. DOING RANSOMWARE TAX LAW OR SIMPLY OF PHISHING EMAILS. THAT THAT THAT BE PUSHED OUT INTO THE SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE SEEING. AYE THE ABILITY OF GETTING INTO OUR NETWORKS ALL OF THAT. ALL OF THAT IS IS A IS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND THROUGH A EFFORTS BY MY PARTNERS THAT ARE GONNA BE SPEAKING IN A FEW MINUTES. I COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT HAS BEEN BETTER EDUCATION THERE'S BEEN BETTER TRAINING. AND WE'VE WE'VE BOLSTERED SO WITH THAT I WILL. STOP ALTERNATE OVER TO.

I DIDN'T DIRECTOR GARRETT RICHIE HAS A GIVEN NOTE A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW IN TERM OF THE THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COURT FOR COR PARTNERS. RANGING FROM CAL SICK BEING THE OVERALL INFORMATION HUB AND DATA SHARING AND INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND COORDINATING. AREA TO DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON THE STATE'S TECHNOLOGY OPERATION INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE CYBERSECURITY YOU KNOW STANDARD NEEDS TO BE APPLY. AND DODD SIMPLY TECHNOLOGY STANDARD ALSO NEED TO BE ASSOCIATED TO THAT WITH CYBERSECURITY DEFENSE AS THE TOP OF MIND. IN ADDITION TO THE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ALSO HAS A SINK ROLE IN THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS EDUCATION TO THE STATE'S GENERAL STATE STOP A PUBLIC. STAFF. IN RAISING AWARENESS AND GIVING THEM TOOLS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM A CYBERSECURITY THREATS. THE THIRD COMPONENT DIED. DOES DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. ALSO IS TASKED TO DO IT'S A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE IT CLASSIFICATION. AS YOU HAVE LIED TO HOLD PREVIOUS CONVERSATION BEFORE THE IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN DECEMBER SECURITY DEFENSE. RELYING ON AUTOMATED TOOL IS ONE THING LOT OF IT IT'S THE HUMAN FACTOR OF IT AND THE HUMAN FACTOR YOU KNOW SPEND THROUGH BOTH. THE USER WHICH IS EDUCATION TO THEM AS WELL AS A GOOD CYBERSECURITY SPECIALIST THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW WORKING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR PUBLIC SECTOR IN GENERAL. IN PROTECTING OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET. ALL THREE OF THOSE AREA OPERATION POLICY AND WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT. YOU CAN HEAR MORE ELABORATION AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ON THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN THAT YEAR'S LAST YEAR TOO FROM PANEL NUMBER TWO SALSA SAVE ALL INTO. THEM DIP DUG THE GOOD EXAMPLES FOR THEM TO ELABORATE ON. BUT I DO WANT TO ECOLE. DIRECTOR. GARY DO SHE SENTIMENT DIED. THE COLLABORATION AMONGST A CORE FOR HERE AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL PARK PARTNERS SO YOU HAVE SEEN MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN TERM OF. THE WHAT USED TO BE A SILO APPROACH IN ADDRESSING CYBERSECURITY NEEDS AND COLLABORATING WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL WHEN INCIDENTS HAPPENED THEIR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND IF IT CRIMINAL. INVESTIGATION IS IT'S WARRANTED IT'S VERY FAST AND IN TERMS OF. GETTING ENGAGED AND HELP TO YOU KNOW STOP RIGHT THERE IN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY THE INDEPENDENT. A SALSA SUSSMAN ANSWER INDEPENDENT OF SECURITY ASSESSMENT BEING CONDUCTED BY DEPARTMENT OF. MILITARY GAVE US ALL OF US IN ADDITIONAL LENDS A PERSPECTIVE ON HOW AND INDIVIDUALS TO ENTITIES ARE DOING WHICH HELPS COMPLETE DOT COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION. ON HOW DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING TODAY OF WHAT TYPE OF MEASURE NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CYBERSECURITY STAND. AGAIN AND WITH THE. MAIN FOCUS HERE IS TO DEAL WITH INCIDENT WHEN WE COME UP IN A SWIFTLY WAY. WORKING WITH FAR PARTNER AND IN BETWEEN INCIDENTS DIED WORKING TO DICK TOGETHER TO PRO ACTIVELY EDUCATE AND MATURING THE STATE ENTITIES SECURITY MEASURE IS THE GOAL OF HUMBLE ITS FORESTS DISPUESTOS STRATEGY OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN CYBERSECURITY DEFENSE. I WILL. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. BUT ALSO DIED WOULD. DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE WHICH IS CHIEF DEPUTY CHRIS CREWS AS WELL AS THE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER PETER LEAVER. COMING UP IN THE PANEL TO DATE PROVIDE THE PANEL MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THOSE EFFORTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR TONGUE AND DOES GENERAL BALDWIN. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR INCLUDING US TODAY. AYE WE'VE SPOKEN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE. THE. CYBERSECURITY THREATS AND YOU KNOW THE MILITARY WE. CATEGORIZE THREATS INTO TWO MAIN BUCKETS I'M WE TALK ABOUT ASYMMETRIC THREATS OF THINGS LIKE CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS ORGANIZATIONS AND WE TALK ABOUT NEAR PEER COMPETITORS WHICH OUR NATION STATE ACTORS THAT HAVE. MILITARY CAPABILITY THAT THREATENS ARE CAPABLE OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY TO DEFEND THIS NATION AND DEFEND U. S. INTERESTS AROUND THE GLOBE. BUT WE STILL HAVE OVER MATCH IN MANY AREAS. MILITARILY THE ONE EXCEPTION IS IN CYBER IN CYBER. ALMOST EVERYONE THAT WE ENCOUNTER THEIR ADVERSARIES. ARE PURE COMPETITORS THERE REALLY GOOD THE GOOD NEWS IS WE TOO ARE VERY GOOD AT DEFENDING OUR NETWORKS AND FINING THESE PROBLEMS BUT IT IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE DOMAIN. THAT IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AND WE IN CONSTANTLY HAVE TO STAY ON OUR TOES. TO BE ABLE TO DETECT AND DEFEAT THREATS TO OUR NETWORKS. THE GOOD NEWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN A RAPID RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN THE INTER AGENCY COOPERATION AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECTIVELY. DEFEND OUR NETWORKS LARGELY THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF DIRECTOR TONG AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND AND DIRECTOR GUILTY CHEAT รณ WE ASK THAT REALLY WHO BROUGHT US TOGETHER. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EACH DEPARTMENT OR AGENCIES UNIQUE CAPABILITIES AND STRENGTHS TO MAKE THE WHOLE TEAM. BETTER WITHIN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WE'VE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR FULL TIME COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE TEAM. FROM EIGHT TO NINETEEN SO THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED OUR REACH TO BE OF THE ABLE TO US DO ASSESSMENTS NOT ONLY WITHIN. STATE AGENCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT NOW ALSO REACHING DOWN TO SOME COUNTIES TO ASSIST COUNTIES WITH THEM PROTECTION OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE IN ADDITION THAT WORK FULL TIME AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WHOSE MAIN TASK IS TO HELP PROTECT THE STATE DATA CENTER. TO WATCH FOR THREATS THERE AND WE HAVE TWO SOLDIERS THAT ARE EMBEDDED. IN THE COW SICK THE PROVIDE A INTO CYBER INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHP AND THE FBI WHEN THERE ARE CYBER INCURSION CASES OR CYBER CRIMES. TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST WITH CYBER FORENSICS AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A TEAM OF THIRTY NINE SOLDIERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON FEDERAL DUTY AT U. S. CYBER COMMAND PERFORMING THEY'RE ABOUT TO COME OFF OF THAT DEPLOYMENT THEY'LL RETURN HERE TO CALIFORNIA AND TEN OF THOSE SOLDIERS WILL BE FULL TIME AND THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS A PART TIME PEOPLE. WE HAVE A PRETTY. WE'RE DEVELOPING A FAIRLY ROBUST BENCH SO IN ADDITION TO OURFULL TIME SEVERAL WARRIORS THAT ARE DOING THINGS FOR THE STATE. WE CAN REACH INTO OUR PART TIME ARMY AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD CYBER ORGANIZATIONS AND BRING THOSE TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO BRING NOT ONLY THEIR WAR FREDERIK SKILLS. BUT SINCE THEY'RE PART TIME ALMOST ALL OF THEM WORK IN CYBER FIELDS IN THEIR CIVILIAN JOBS AND THEY BRING UNIQUE SKILL SET SO WE CAN BRING THEM ON FOR. SHORT PERIODS OF TIME EITHER TO DO ASSESSMENTS TO HELP TO TRAINING OR TO HELP. DO FORENSIC WORK IN THE EVENT OF A CYBER INTRUSION. SO WE ARE. REALLY PUTTING A BIG EFFORT TOWARDS THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED THIS IS THE ONLY DOMAIN WHERE WE DON'T OVER MATCH OUR ADVERSARIES EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS JUST AS GOOD AS THAT AT AS WE ARE. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE'RE GOOD AT DEFENDING THEIR GOOD ATTACKING AND WE HAVE TO STAY ON OUR TOES AND HAPPILY AGAIN WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE. ON THE STATE'S AND PRETTY GOOD HANDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. COMMISSIONER STANLEY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN CHURCHTOWN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR AND I'M HERE TO COME BEFORE YOU SPEAK. ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE OUR PARTNERS HERE AT THE TABLE. I JUST WANT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CHP ZERO ONE AND WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR OUR PARTNERS HERE OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS I HAVE BEACH OVER RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY. CYBER ATTACKED OR CYBER CRIME THAT OCCURS TO THE STATE AGENCY A STATE ENTITY OUR STATE FACILITY. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE PUT TOGETHER WHAT WE CALL OUR COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATION UNIT. THAT UNIT IS COMPRISED OF A LIEUTENANT A SERGEANT. SEVEN INVESTIGATORS INTO IT SYSTEMS SPECIALIST AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING CYBERCRIMES BUT ALSO THEY WORK VERY WELL. WITH OUR PARTNERS HERE AT THE TABLE AND PARTNERS. THAT YOU THAT YOU SEE UP THERE. ONE OF THOSE INVESTIGATORS IS ASSIGNED TO THE. THAT CALIFORNIA'S CYBERSECURITY SECURITY IMMIGRATION CENTER. SO WHAT HAVE BEEN THAT INVESTIGATORS THERE. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION SHARING INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND A LOT OF COORDINATION THAT IS. I BELIEVE THIS DIRECTOR YOU WOULD DO TO YOU MY PARTNER SAID. HAVE IMPROVE IMPROVE DATA THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CYBER THREATS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. ALSO. R. CC AYE YOU DOES IS THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE FBI CYBER CRIMES TASK FORCE HEARING SACRAMENTO SO HELPLESS. AND WITH THEM THERE'S SOME FEDERAL ASSETS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH AND ALSO WORKING WITH. A GENERAL BALDWIN AND THAT HIS STAFF WHICH IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. AS DIRECTOR GIVE A DIGI SAID WE WE COME A LONG WAY AND WE MADE A LOT A LOT OF VERY VERY GOOD PROGRESS. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND. I JUST LIKE BEING BY SAYING THAT. WE NEED TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING BURKE WERE WORKING TOGETHER. THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AND I'M VERY VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMISSIONER. A QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION PUBLIC FOR DIRECTOR TONG. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS THE PERFECT SIDERS CYBERSECURITY BUT. THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUALLY BE ATTENTION BETWEEN THE AGGRESSORS AS NEW VULNERABILITIES ARE IDENTIFIED AS COMPUTING POWER NETWORK BANDWIDTH INCREASE. AND THEN. THE DEFENDERS. AS. THOSE VULNERABILITIES ARE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED AND AS NEW TACTICS AND. AND NEW BAD ACTORS ARE IDENTIFIED SO. THE BALANCE OF POWER'S GOING TO SHIFT BACK AND FORTH I'M CURIOUS AS TO YOUR OPINION. WHETHER WE ARE. WE'RE WINNING THE BATTLE OF WERE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HER WERE ABOUT THE SAME PLACE WHERE WE WERE TWO YEARS AGO WITH ERRORS IN RESPECT OF THOSE THINGS. AND I WOULD DIE I I PROBABLY WON'T PUT DEED OPINION ON WHETHER WE ARE. WINNING OR LOSING ABOUT OR OR EVEN BUT I CAN CITE DOT SPECIFICALLY. WOULD YOU HAVE CITED THE THAT THERE'S TWO PRONGED APPROACH WERE OR WERE IMPLEMENTING AND AND AND IS HAVE SEEN GREAT RESULTS FROM IT. NUMBER ONE AS I MENTIONED DIED. DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES TOSSED TO SAID THE TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THAT AND WE HAVE RECENTLY. STOOD UP A. A HYBRID CLOUD SERVICE WHICH AGAIN THAT WOULD BE ELABORATE FURTHER OUGHT TO DEFINE A VERY HIGH STANDARD OF A SECURITY MEASURE AND AND AND AND AND. AND I'LL PUT THAT INTO A POLICY AS A WAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STAND STATE ENTITY THAT YOUR WHOLE LIFE SEEING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK CONNECTION TO MEET THAT PARTICULAR STANDARD. AND THAT'S A PROACTIVE WAY TOO IF YOU WOULD SAFEGUARD YOU KNOW THAT THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY THAT WHICH PROBABLY ON AS A WAY OF. PUTTING ADDITIONAL. A CHALLENGES FOR ANY OF THE ATTACKERS WANTS TO COME IN THAT IS NUMBER ONE FROM A POLICY AND PROCEDURE PROSPECTIVE. NUMBER TWO. WE HAVE BUT A STOOD UP THE FIRST EVER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CYBERSECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THE STATE DATA CENTER. DOT IS A WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAL SIGNAL THE PARTNER HERE THAT PROVIDES TO THE E. OF VANCE MONITORING TO A VERY SPECIFIC LEVEL TO PRO ACTIVELY WATCHING WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT TRANSITION OF A CONNECTIVITY. AND INFORMATION SHARING AND WITH THAT KIND OF A MONITORING AND A HIGH STANDARD FROM THE NETWORK PERSPECTIVE WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE TWO. FAIRLY. FOR ACTIVE MEASURES INFORMATION SECURITY MOONLIGHT DOLLAR HIS THINK YOU'VE SEEN OFF TIME IS KEEPING UP WHAT IS GOING ON WITH. ALL OF THE. YOU KNOW MEASURES IN PLACE HELPS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE A STEP AHEAD IF NOT SWITCHED UP AT LEAST HALF A STEP AHEAD. SETTING THE STANDARD SETTING THE POLICY IMPLEMENTING THOSE POLICY AND THEN PRACTICALLY MONITORING. SO THAT'S FOR OUR. APPROACH IN ADDRESSING. THANK YOU ARE BUT YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK. I WONDER THOUGH IF WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT SOME METRICS TO TRY AND IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE WINNING OR LOSING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ORGANIZATION YOU SUCKED GOALS. YOU SET PROCEDURES FROM MEETING THOSE GOALS I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE RETROSPECTIVE AND. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE AND SEE IF WE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING AFFECTED PRESENT NOT EFFECTIVE OR YOU KNOW AND AND LET US GUIDE LETTERS USE THOSE METRICS TO GUIDE FUTURE DECISIONS SO. THE I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT OF NOT NUMBER OF BREACHES OR THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT'S BEEN COMPROMISED OR SOMETHING OR SOME SORT OF METRIC. THE TRIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE WINNING A REAL LOSING OR GAINING GROUND I THINK THERE WILL BE FRUITFUL IN IDENTIFYING OTHER PATHS THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THANK YOUR FOR THAT SEGUE DOT HEIGHT I DID NEGLECT TO MENTION THAT. THINK WAS LITERALLY TWO WEEKS AGO. DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE ISSUED OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ANNUAL REPORT. AND THE ANNUAL REPORT ITSELF. I WISH I BROUGHT A COPY WITH ME I WILL MAKE SURE THAT A COPIES DELIVERED TO ALL THE MEMBERS COMMITTEE. THAT HAVE LOW HUGE PAGE NOT HUGE GREAT TWO PAGES FOR OF. METRICS THE ARE RANGING NOT JUST A CYBERSECURITY RELATED MATRIX THAT WAS BUILDING UPON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN'S PERFORMED METRICS BUT ALSO. HAVE METRICS ON THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SIDE OF THINGS AND THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZATION THIS CENTER SECTION STANDARDIZATION SIDE OF THINGS SO YES WE ARE HEAVILY. USING THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO GUIDE HERSELF AND ASHURA PROGRESS BUT WERE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THOSE METRICS TO BETTER CAPTURED YOU KNOW WHAT TRUE MEASUREMENT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO BETTER ABOUT. YOU KNOW MEASURE PROGRESS SO BASED ON THOSE METRICS WOULD YOU SAY WERE MAKING PROGRESS. BASED ON THIS METRIC COMPARED TO DAWSON SEVEN TWO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WOULD DEFINITELY MAKING PROGRESS IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAP ARM I JUST OF A BROAD QUESTION AND A WHEN IT COMES TO PREPAREDNESS TO AS A STATE AGAINST A CYBER ATTACKS ON. HOW DO WE STACK UP AGAINST OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY ON? ANYONE WHO GOING THEY ARE FAKE THE QUESTION I. YOU KNOW. ALL ALL THE STATE'S OBVIOUSLY HAVE A CYBER THREAT. SO SOME MORE THAN OTHERS AND IT DEPENDS ON THE. IT DEPENDS ON THE. CYBER ACTOR AND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA. GIVEN ITS RICH. ECONOMY AND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE YOU KNOW WE ARE. A HUGE TARGET FOR. FOR EXAMPLE ESPIONAGE IN BEING ABLE TO GET. BUSINESS. AT BUSINESS ADVANTAGE. DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STATES OF OUR. ACTIVELY PURSUING SOME SORT OF CYBER DEFENSE CAPABILITY. BUT. THERE'S ONLY ONLY A HANDFUL THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE OUT IN CALIFORNIA AND DOUBT WE WERE CLOSELY. WITH. THE VARIOUS OTHER INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS IN THE COUNTRY. AND AND THOSE INTELLIGENCE NET THOSE INTELLIGENCE CENTERS ARE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE CYBER UNITS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING IN PLACE BUT. I THINK YOU KNOW. THERE'S PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT STATES NOW THAT HAVE REALLY STARTED TO BUILD. CAPACITY LIKE WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE IN WEEK AND WE'RE LEARNING FROM THEM AS WELL SOME OF THE HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS. THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT INCORPORATING IN THE AND THEY'RE TAKING OBVIOUSLY FOR MONTHS IT IS A IT IS THE IT IS REALLY BUILT ON THIS COLLABORATIVE. SHARING OF INFORMATION PLATFORM AND AS FAR AS THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE CYBER ATTACKS SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S BEING SINGLED OUT OR. IS CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT. ABOUT ACTORS TEND TO TARGET OF FOR EXAMPLE. I WOULD NOT I WOULD NOT I CAN WE SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE BEAN. SINGLE BALLOT I I WOULD I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A CYBER INTRUSION OUR CYBER ATTACK OF SOME SORT. YOU ONLY REALLY HEAR ABOUT THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW THEY GET TO THE MEDIA THERE. THIS TEAM ARE AND THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU ARE WORKING. WE NIGHT DAY AND THEY ARE MITIGATING A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT'S COMING IN THROUGH. BUT. IT BE AS THE AS THE GENERAL SAID THIS IS THIS IS A THIS IS A NON YOU KNOW NONSTOP KINDA DEAL AND IT REQUIRES. THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE ENGAGEMENT. I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW. THE ONLY OTHER. PART OF THAT IS THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE A GREAT ECONOMY AND WE DO HAVE A VERY INNOVATIVE. INDUSTRIAL BASE AND AND THAT INNOVATION IS. ATTRACTIVE TO. FOREIGN ACTORS AND AND AND AND OTHERS AND I'M YOU KNOW WITH WITH. AND I THINK THAT WITH WITH THE CASE OF BOB YOU KNOW SORT OF POLITICAL STANCES. LA TIMES WE WILL WILSON STARTING THE SEA RANSOMWARE AND OTHER KINDS OF A DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS. THAT OCCUR. GENERALLY MOST OF THE STATES ARE SEEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL DEPENDS ON ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE POLITICAL NURSES OF THE OF AN EVENT THIS MAKE TAKING PLACE IN THE STATE OR SOME KIND OF A MESSAGE THAT. A GROUP WANTS TO MAKE. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT INFRASTRUCTURE WE LOOK AT STEALING YOU KNOW FROM AN ESPIONAGE STANDPOINT OR. OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ARE THOSE THE ONES THAT WERE REALLY. REALLY WATCHING OUT FOR BECAUSE. THOSE TO CREATE A LOT OF DAMAGE AND AND I'M AS YOU YOU HEARD IN THE MEDIA OTHERS. THERE IS A LOT OF. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THAT IN IN THE COUNTRY TODAY. CAN YOU ALSO DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC ON DE AMOUNT OF US CYBER ATTACKS OUR. OUR. BY CATEGORIES OR EXAMPLE ATTACK SO BY NATION STAY ATTACKS BY. ACTIVISM OR OTHERWISE OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE. AND THE LIKE. I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK WHEN THE SECOND PANEL COMES UP AND THEY TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS THAT THEY THAT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU LOW BUT HAVE A GREAT THANK YOU. I I HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS FOR EACH OF YOU BUT I I'VE FIRST. THE GUESTS FIVE ONE IT SAID IN ISRAEL'S DO YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND WELCOME TO HAVE. THE PANEL. THANK YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR. THE FIRST THAT THE FIRST THING I. JUST WANTED TO MENTION. IN RESPONSE MISTER OBERNOLTE AYE I WAS. A ABOUT. WHEN WE LOOK AT METRICS AND AND. HOW MUCH WE'RE IMPROVING OUR STANCE I'D I'D THOUGHT WHAT WAS REALLY QUITE COMPELLING? IS THAT MOST OF THE DEPARTMENTS WHEN THEY SWITCHED OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE THAT YOU'RE READY SEEING. A VERY LARGE DROP IN. THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL FISHING EMAILS AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST. MEAN TO YOU KNOW WE ALL WERE OFTEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS COMPLICATED. TECHNOLOGY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IS IT'S REALLY THE THE THE WEAK LINK IS ALL. IT'S THE USER SO MAYBE YOU COULD JUST KIND OF. TOUCH ON. THE IMPROVEMENTS YOU'VE SEEN THAT AS YOU'RE SWITCHING OVER TO. OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE. ABSOLUTELY AND DATA ALSO THE A SECOND PANEL THAT. SHOULD BE W. CHRIS CHRIS WERE FURTHER ELABORATE ON THIS AS WELL. BUT I KNOW IN A BRIEF SUMMARY. BY SWITCHING THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A PUBLIC SECTOR EMAIL BOX INTO A SINGLE. EMAIL SYSTEM CALL A MICROSOFT OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SECURITY MEASURE HOLISTICALLY. VERSUS IN THE PAST WHEN EACH DEPARTMENT ARE HANDLING THINGS ON THEIR OWN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON THAT. INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTIVENESS TO TO TO TO TO CENTRALLY MANAGING THE SECURITY MEASURE. AND. MICROSOFT ITSELF HAVE ALSO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE UTILIZED TO HELP SCREEN OUR FLAG ABOUT MAYBE A BETTER WORK THAT THESE FISHING THE MOUSE WITH A COMBINATION OF USER TRAINING. AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY ARE BEING CENTRALLY MANAGE THEN IT'S A IT'S A MORE CONSISTENT APPROACH ACROSS THE STATE IN IN MEETING ABOUT. MITIGATING OR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FISHING AMOUNT THAT COME TO THE END USER WHICH PUTS FURTHER BURDEN ON AND YOU SORT OF SELF TO TRYING TO. YOU KNOW TO FILTER THOSE SOUTH SO YES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. OKAY. BUT I THE QUESTION FOR. DIRECTOR GILLER DUCE YOU'VE HAD OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF. EMERGENCIES NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE STATE A LOT SO HOW HOW IS I'M CYBERSECURITY. PRIORITIZE WITH WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE OTHER. DISASTROUS GOING ON SO WHAT MIGHT. HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE IF. THROUGHOUT FIGHTING THE FIRES AND THERE IS A. BIG CYBER ATTACK. WHAT'S THE ODDS AGREE QUESTION. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A YEAR AND. AND. PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT IN YOUR DISTRICT ON ON THE DISASTERS THAT ARE WE GOING ON DOWN THERE. IT YOU KNOW THE THE CAL SECOND THE TEAM THAT'S THAT'S HERE THIS IS A DEDICATED TEAM TO CYBERSECURITY. PROTECTION AYE IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE THAT THAT CYBERSECURITY IMMIGRATION CENTER OUR AND OUR. THE C. TEASE THAT NETWORK DEFENSE THAT THERE THE GUARDS NEVER DEFENSE AND SAGE BE. ALL OF THEM ARE FOCUSED ON IDEALLY WITH. THE DAILY DAY MONITORING OF OF CYBER THREATS TO THE STATE NOW I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE HAVE A DISASTER. ALL OF ANY SORT WHETHER IT'S NATURAL OR OUR HUMAN COST. THAT THAT INTEGRATION A SORT OF TAKES A STEP UP WHERE WORK WERE WERE WORKING MUCH CLOSER WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNER AGENCIES. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT TIME WE CAN BE PERCEIVED AS VULNERABLE DURING THESE SITUATIONS AND AS A RESULT. OF SOME OF THESE ACTORS MAY WANT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. CERTAIN KINDS OF. BY THE VARIOUS ACTIVITY AND SO WE ARE WE ARE REALLY WORKING HARD DURING THOSE TIMES THIS TEAM IS WORKING EXTRA HARD. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THE INTERDICT ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE THAT. WE KNOW WE HAD A CASE SINCE IN CINEMA COUNTY THAT WHILE THEY WERE DEALING WITH. FLOOD EMERGENCY. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A DEAD ALISTAIR ATTACK RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR A RESPONSE WHICH THEN BROUGHT THEIR SYSTEM DOWN WHICH MADE IT VERY COMPLICATED ON THEIR. ABILITY TO DO ALL THE COORDINATION WITH THE IDEA WE. THE CYBER SECURITY TO GRACIOUS CENTER WORKING. AND CONNECTING THEM WITH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. OF. COMMUNICATED RAPIDLY. WE WORK WITH OUR OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND AND. AND OTHER ENTITIES TO MOVE IN UP PORTABLE MOBILE CAPABILITIES TO GET CINEMA COUNTY UP ONLINE TO BE ABLE TO DO A WORKAROUND TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THEIR EMERGENCY RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITIES WHILE THEY WERE DEALING WITH THE CYBER PROBLEM THEY WERE HAVING THE SITE. SO I GUESS THE SHORT OF IT IS THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY MONITORING IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT AT TIMES WE ARE ARE LOOKING AT ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND WE'RE PREPARED TO RESPOND. DURING THOSE EVENTS TO MAKE SURE WE MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL CYBER ATTACK. CAN AND ON THAT VEIN THAT ARE YOU STILL ON TRACK FOR TO. DEVELOP THE UMPS CYBER. RESPONSE PLAN. YES ACTUALLY. AND THAT'S EVER TO GET TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT THAT YEAH THE THE CYBER RESPONSE PLAN I THINK. THERE'S A THERE'S A CYBER JOINT CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE GUY THAT WAS THIS PUBLISHED THIS MONTH AND. THE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY NOW TIED IN WITH THE AS AS A DIRECTOR TOM MENTIONED. THE PROPER TECHNOLOGY CERDIC SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER BUILDING THAT OUT A CRITICAL COMPONENT INTO OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO HAVE THAT FEED IT'S COMING IN FROM THE DATA CENTER. INTO THE CAL SEC SO THAT WE NOW HAVE THIS OVER ARCHING. SORT OF VISUAL THIS I GUESS YOU COULD SAY OF OF THE VERY STREAMS. THAT PLUGS INTO THE FILE THAT'S REALLY THE FINAL PIECE TO PLUGGING INTO WHAT WE CALL OUR E. SF EIGHTEEN. RESPONSE GUIDE AND. AND AND WE WE EXPECT THAT TO BE DONE HERE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS RIGHT THANK YOU AND DIRECTOR TALKING YOU DISCUSSED CBT IS ROLE AS. REVIEWER OF. I. T. REQUESTS HAS BEEN USED TO INCREASE THE STATE SAYS CYBER. POSITIONING. I OF PURSUE MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHEN THERE'S A BUDGET CHANGE REQUEST BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL COMING ALONG HOW DOES. WHAT IS THE CITY'S ROLE IN REVIEWING AND RECOMMENDING? YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE ACTION NEED TO TAKE ON THOSE BCP. YES I WE HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT UP BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL PROCESS. AND REVIEWING DIED WE WERE ABLE TO USE INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SELF OF BECAUSE YOU'RE BROUGHT ANNUALLY STILL HAVE TO SUBMIT THEIRANNUAL SELF ASSESSMENT REPORT. WERE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION PLUS THE BI ANNUAL INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT ARE CONDUCTED BY DEPARTMENT OF MY MILITARY OR ANY THIRD PARTY. IF THEY CHOOSE TO AS WELL AS THE OUR TRIANNUAL SOON TO BECOME A EVERY FOUR YEARS AUDIT OF THE HIGH RISK DEPARTMENTS. SO. AND THERE ARE ONGOING SOME SOMEONE QUARTERLY BASIS SOME ON IN OTHER FREQUENCY WHAT WE CALL THAT. A POEM THE. ACTION FOR MILESTONE. AS A HOLISTIC OF SCORING PROCESS IF YOU WOULD ON THEIR SICK. MAJORITY METRICS AND HOW THE DEPARTMENTS THEIR STRATEGY THEIR PLAN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION TRACK RECORD IN IN IN MATURING THEMSELVES. ENOUGH COMPARING THAT TO THE BUDGET CHANGE REQUEST THAT THEY HAVE PUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT THEY HAVE TO SEE IF THERE ARE PUTTING THE REQUESTED IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN MITIGATING THE RIGHT PHONE ABILITY. SO THAT KIND OF A REVIEW PROCESS IS TAKING PLACE BEHIND THE SCENES WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE ALSO. VERY TRANSPARENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT IF WE THINK HEY YOU HAVE MERIT ON THIS BUT YOU'RE NOT. REALLY INVESTING IN THE RIGHT PLACE WERE ALSO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT SO THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT. SO THAT'S OUR. INVOLVEMENT AND SO THAT'S BEEN A. BIG POSITIVE CHANGE DO YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO CONTINUE ON THIS TRAJECTORY. CORRECT AND AND THANKS TO ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX SEVENTY LAST YEAR BECAUSE PRIOR TO THIS WE WERE HEAVILY RELYING ON THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING SELF REPORTING YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD MEASURE BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE AN ALSO A CHECK AND BALANCE YOU KNOW. ASSESSMENT ON TOP OF DIED SO THE COMBINATION OF SELF REPORTING INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT AND AUDIT FOR THE HIGH RISK THAT GIVES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. GENERAL BALDWIN DO. OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE BEEN KEY AND AND. GETTING US WHERE WE ARE WITH THE ASSESSMENTS MILITARY DEPARTMENT DO YOU THINK THERE IS A LONG TERM ROLE FOR THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND CYBERSECURITY FROM STATE. THAT THERE IS. AND AND THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. OUR OWN SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN ARE TRAINED TO A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD THAN. WHAT YOU CAN GENERALLY FIND IN EVEN THE CIVILIAN WORLD? ABOUT COMING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE. SILICON VALLEY NOW BECAUSE OUR SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN. GET TRAINED TO THE NSA AND U. S. CYBER COMMAND STANDARDS. FOR THAT IT ENABLE THEM TO DO THEIR WAR FIGHTING CYBER TASKS OF DEFENDING THE NET NETWORK ANOTHER OTHER TASKS THAT THEY GET A SIGN WHEN THEY DO THAT. WARFIGHTING MISSION. NAM SO WERE ABLE TO BRING OF SKILL SETS BACK UP TO A ADVANCED DEGREE TO BE ABLE TO. DO ASSESSMENTS AND THEN BE ABLE TO. COACH DEPARTMENTS AND DEPARTMENT OF CIO'S ON THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO TO IMPROVE THEIR CYBER HYGIENE. WE'RE FINDING. ACROSS THE. ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT THAT. PEOPLE CYBER WHERE IT SAYS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS LARGELY BECAUSE THE EFFORTS OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE HERE INVOLVED DIDN'T HURT TO HAVE A AT. GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TELL TO TUNE INTO IT TOO. BUT HOME WANTED AND JUST ONE OF THE IS IS THIS IS KIND OF SUBJECTIVE BUT BUT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. ABOUT METRICS IS THAT WE NOW ARE OUR TEAMS ARE MUCH BETTER RECEIVED WHEN THEY GO INTO. VISIT DEPARTMENTS AND WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS THAT WE GO BACK FOR A SECOND LOOK. WHERE IS WHEN WE IN AND THE FIRST TIME WE FOUND ALL KINDS OF ALL ABILITIES NOW THEY'VE REALLY TIGHTENED UP THEIR NETWORKS TO TIGHTEN UP THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES? AND WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE CAN DO MORE ADVANCED PENETRATION TESTING. WHEREAS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. IT WAS ANYMORE SPEND THE TIME DOING THAT BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST ONLY BASIC VULNERABILITIES ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT SO WE'RE SEEING A. THEY. BUT. VERY POSITIVE MOVEMENT AND DIRECTION IN TERMS OF. LEADERSHIP'S APPROACH NON CYBER LEADERS UNDERSTANDING THE THREATS AND UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THEIR NETWORKS OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES SECURE. RIGHT INTO GENERAL BALDWIN AND THEN OF MY LAST QUESTION. FOR A COMMISSIONER STANLEY IS. DO GET REQUESTS FOR FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO HELP WITH. CYBER RELATED CRIME. YES WE DO CRAM. ART TO NEED A. COMPUTER CRASH INVESTIGATION UNIT. THEY WILL ALSO ASSIST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IF. IF THERE'S A NEED THERE AND WILL WORK WITH THIS GROUP TO GIVE THEM ASSISTANCE AND. ALSO.

VERY HONORED TO BE PART OF AND. TO WORKING WITH SUCH A GREAT GROUP OF CYBER WAR YEARS THAT WE HAVE HERE. I THINK WE'VE REALLY GELLED AS A GROUP. I THINK WE'VE MADE SOME REALLY GOOD PROGRESS THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT. AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED OUR HOME AND. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MY FIGHTING THIS FIGHT AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE THESE FOLKS IS MAYA BATTLE BUDDIES. I WON EXPAND UPON. DIRECTOR GALLUCCI'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY IMMIGRATION CENTER AND HIGHLIGHT THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING AT THE STRATEGIC TACTICAL. OPERATIONAL LEVELS AS RETAINS A CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCY AND MATURITY. FIRST LET ME DISCUSS WHAT WE'VE DONE AT THE STRATEGIC LEVEL. ITS BEEN A BUSY YEAR AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO MAKE SURE CYBERSECURITY WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE. FIRST WE CREATED AND PUBLISHED THE CALIFORNIA JOINT CYBER IT'S A COMMUNICATIONS FRAMEWORK. A CLEARLY ARTICULATE THE COORDINATED PROCESS FOR COMMUNICATING AND REPORTING CYBER INCIDENTS. AND THIS IS FOR ALL STATE LOCAL TRIBAL TERRITORIAL. AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS ONCE AN INCIDENT OCCURS. THIS FRAMEWORK ALSO DISCUSSES THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH OF THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS. AS WELL OF THE VICTIM ENTITIES ONCE AN INCIDENT HAS A S. HAS BEEN ESCALATED AND IT'S BASED ON THE CRITERIA THAT WE PUT IN THE PLAN. WE ALSO CREATED AND PUBLISHED THE CALIFORNIA JOINT CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE GUIDE. TO ASSIST ALL CALIFORNIA ANDES BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. TO UNDERSTAND THE IDENTIFICATION THE REPORTING. AND RECOVERY PROCEDURES ADOPTED THAT WE'VE ADOPTED AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS THE COURT REQUIREMENT AND EIGHTY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE. THIS IS A STEP BY STEP HOW TO. MANUAL THAT ANY ENTITY CAN USE TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN CYBERSECURITY IT'S A RESPONSE PLAN OR. USE IT AS A STANDALONE PLAN SHOULD THEY BECOME VICTIM A VICTIM OF A CYBER ATTACK. AND THE CATHOLIC IS ALSO WORKING TO EXERCISE OUR INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. TO THAT END THE CAL SICK. OUR PARTICIPATED IN THE NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY CORPORATIONS GREAT ACTS. WITH ONE OF OUR UTILITY PARTNERS. CRITICS IS A NATIONAL TRAINING EXERCISE THE TACKLES POTENTIAL CYBERSECURITY THREATS. AND VULNERABILITIES IN THE NATION'S ELECTRIC GRID. WE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE NATIONAL SIDE REGARD PRELUDE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ACTUAL SIZE IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. NOW SOME REGARD PRELUDE IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST ORGANIZATIONS AT ALL LEVELS FROM LOCAL ALL WOULD FEDERAL. IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF CYBER SECURITY PREVENTION PROTECTION MITIGATION AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. THIS YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'RE GONNA AGAIN PARTICIPATE IN A FEW MONTHS BUT WE'RE GONNA EXPAND OUR LEVEL OF PLAY TO INCLUDE EXERCISING OUR INSTANT RESPONSE PLANS. AND COORDINATING WITH OUR FOUR CORE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS. NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE OUR TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE INITIATIVES WERE WORKING AT AT THE TACTICAL LEVEL. ONEOF THE AREAS WE PLACE A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON DURING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS ARE OUT REACH PROGRAM. IN OTHER WORDS GETTING THE WORD OUT TO THE COUNTIES CITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE EDUCATIONAL UTILITY. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HEALTH CARE AND BANKING SECTORS ABOUT WHO THE CAL SICK IS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM. AND THIS IS PAID OFF. WE BEGAN THE YEAR WITH ABOUT HUNDRED AND TWENTY CYBER THREAT INFORMATION SHARING PARTNERS AND A PILOT PROGRAM OF AUTOMATED CYBER THIEVES WITH THREE OF THOSE PARTNERS. TODAY I CAN REPORT TO YOU THAT WE HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED CYBER THREAT SHARING PARTNERS AND HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR AUTOMATED CYBER THREAT FEED PARTNERS INCLUDING STATE COUNTY CITY. AND FUSION CENTER PARTNERS. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH POTENTIAL PARTNERS RIGHT NOW INCLUDING A MAJOR PUBLIC UTILITY. AND ARE PRESENTLY IN FINAL COORDINATING TALKS TO GET THEM ON THE AUTOMATED FEE PROGRAM. OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE TWENTY AUTOMATED CYBER THREAT FEED PARTNERS BY THE END OF CAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS A DIRECTOR GUILTY DUTY POINTED OUT. IN BANKING. AND EDUCATIONAL AND UTILITIES CREEK ON STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE. ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HARD TO MATURE AND CAL SICK IS OUR THREAT INFORMATION SHARING PARTNERSHIPS. WE BEGAN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARMED WITH ABOUT TWENTY SOURCES OF CYBER THREAT INFORMATION AND TODAY WE HAVE OVER SEVENTY PARTNER ENTITIES PROVIDING THREAT FEEDS FROM SUCH ORGANIZATIONS. AS THE FBI. DEPARTMENT HOMELESS SECURITY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS SUCH AS FAR AYE AND THREAT CONNECT. WE'RE INGESTING THESE FEEDS. AND SHARING CYBER THREAT INFORMATION WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED CYBER Y. PARTNER STATEWIDE. AND THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS IS CONSISTENTLY GROWING. THAT MEANS WE CAN PROVIDE A BROADER RANGE OF CORRELATED CYBER THREAT INFORMATION TO OUR STEP STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY PARTNERS. AND ADDITIONALLY I KIND OF GOES BACK TO A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW OTHER STATES. WE HAVE HAD CALLS FROM. A FEW OTHER STATES TO ASK US TO HELP THEM INITIATE MATURE AND IMPLEMENT THEIR SABERS A IMMIGRATION CENTERS IN THEIR STATES BASED ON WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH MODEL HERE. NOW I'D LIKE TO TO A DISCUSS SOME OF THEIR OPERATIONAL SUCCESSES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE STATE. FIRST LET ME. DISCUSSED THE STATE BAN OUR CUS PERSKY PRODUCTS. IN MID JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ARE CASSOCK ANALYSTS BECAME AWARE OF THREAT INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS FIRST YEAR LAB. WE RESEARCHED A THREAT. AND IT ASSESSED THE RISK AS A HIGH PRIORITY. WE IMMEDIATELY ALERTED DIRECTOR GIL DIGI. IN HIS ROLE AS A HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER. TECHNOLOGY. WITHIN HOURS WE PREACH SECRETARY BADGER FROM GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. AND IN LESS THAN A WEEK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUBLISHED A JOINT POLICY. DOT OF SHE'S MADE JOINT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES POLICY BANNING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF KASPERSKY LAB PRODUCTS. FROM STATE MORE NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND WE WERE THE FIRST TO DO SO. THE CATHOLIC ALSO ISSUED AN UNCLASSIFIED ALERT TO ALL OF OUR STATE LOCAL TRIBAL AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY PARTNERS STATEWIDE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF INSERT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE WE PROVIDED. IT'S TO A TRANSIT AUTHORITY WHO EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT CYBER ATTACK. THE CALCIUM SPOTTED ALONG WITH OTHER FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL CYBERSECURITY PARTNERS BUT THE CAL SICK TOOK THE LEAD. AND WE HELPED COORDINATE THEIR IT'S A RESPONSE AND HELP THEM GET BACK UP AND RUNNING TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. AND SINCE JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CASSOCK HAS COORDINATED THE ANSWER RESPONSE FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE STATEWIDE INCIDENTS. INCLUDING CYBER ATTACKS ON EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE INCIDENTS RAGE IN SEVERITY FROM WEBSITE DEFACE MINTS. THE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE INCLUDING BOTNET ACTIVITY. EMAIL TAX RANSOMWARE COMPROMISED ACCOUNTS AND STOLEN THAT WERE CREDENTIALS. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THE EFFORTS OF THE CAL SICK ARE TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MATURE IN THE AREA OF CYBER SECURITY AND WE ARE TAKING A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH A CYBERSECURITY THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. BUT AS EVERYONE ELSE THAT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OR CYBER RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. APOTHECARY MUCH OUT COMMANDER TRICIA ARE LET'S TURN TURN OVER TO NEXT SPEAKER. LIMIT JUST INTRODUCED US TO THE REST OF THE PRESENTERS SO. WE ALSO HAVE CHRIS CRUSOE WHO IS THE CHIEF A DEPUTY DIRECTOR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. POPULARLY BURKE A CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. ARE WE ALSO HAVE LIEUTENANT COLONEL JIM PARSONS SO WITH THE CYBER NETWORK DEFENSE TEAM A WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT OF FINALLY WE HAVE ARE ALSO SCOTT HA HA HOWLIN. WHO IS THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER WITH A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL SO WITHOUT THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO? OUR. MR TIP A DIRECTOR A TRUCE. RIGHT. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON CHRISTOPHER'S MENTION I'M CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY APART MY OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES IS A STATE WIDE DATA CENTER. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE'VE COME IN THE PAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. PART OF THAT HAS BEEN THE FUNCTIONAL REALIGNMENT THAT OUT DIRECTOR TOM SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER IN HER DISSERTATION TO REALLY INTEGRATE THE STATEWIDE DATA CENTER OPERATIONS AND THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SECURITY I CONDUCTED BY OUR AYE. AYE AYE SO PETER LABOR AND IMPORTANT SIX NEGATIVE ABOUT IS INTEGRATING CORE SERVICES ACROSS PROGRAMMATIC OPERATIONS FOR THE STATE. PHASE ONE OF THAT. PROCESS AND PRIORITY WAS A STATEWIDE EMAIL MIGRATION OF OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EMAIL BOXES IS SLATED TO BE COMPLETE TOMORROW MARCH FIRST. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS AGAIN ONE SINGLE STATEWIDE EMAIL SYSTEM THAT HAS A COMMENT STATEWIDE POP POSTURE FOR THE STANDARDIZATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM. THROUGHOUT THE STATEWIDE NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA KNOWN TO SEE JEN. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THAT NOW IS THAT ONCE WE HAVE ADVANCED THREAT PROTECTION IN PLACE IS A COMMON INDICATOR ACROSS OUR WHOLE EMAIL SYSTEM. I WOULD BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THIS IS A PART OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH PURVIEW THAT WE HAVE JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS COMMON STRUCTURING COMMON STANDARDS COMMON. ALSO WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION AS WELL AS OUR PROLIFERATION OF OUR CLOUD ACTIVITIES IN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NOW PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL CLOUD SERVICES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW PROVIDES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WELL NOW WHEN THEY GET THEY HAVE THEY GET AMAZON OR THEY GET MICROSOFT AZURE OTHER SERVICES THAT COME THROUGH OUR TRAIN IT'S NOW PART OF OUR INTERCONNECTION CORE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR STATE LIGHT SYSTEM. WHY IS A SIGNIFICANT AGAIN FOR SECURITY REASONS WE HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SECURITY STANDARDS IMPOSTERS IN PLACE NOW THAT ALIGN WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS? VERY SIGNIFICANT PROTECTING DURING THE STATE'S MOST MISSION CRITICAL DATA. AS A BENEFIT OF THAT TO ALSO NOW WE HAVE IMMIGRATION INTO OUR PUBLIC PRIVATE PLATFORM WE HAVE VISIBILITY. AND TO THE STATEWIDE NETWORKS ARE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S VERY FEDERATED STATE WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY THE STANDARDIZATION OF OUR PLATFORMS SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT SECURITY A COMMON SECURITY APPROACH IN A CENTRALIZED PERSPECTIVE. THAT ARE STATEWIDE DATA CENTER AND THEN HOW WE INTEGRATE DOWN INTO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE NETWORKS AND NOW OUR AYE SO PETER LEGAL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN TERMS IN POINTING. ENCRYPTION IN SOME THE NEXT STEPS IN THOSE PROVERBIAL PROCESSES. THE OTHER AREA TO THE PROVINCE YOUR ATTENTION SHE GEN ARE CALIFORNIA GENERAL ENTERPRISE NETWORK GOVERNMENT IMPRESS NETWORK NOW WE NOW HAVE A STATEWIDE OFFICE OF SECURITY CENTER THAT OPERATIONS INTRO ROUNDS THAT TERRORISTS IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. SO THE SE WHY DATACENTER TODAY EFFECTIVE ON JULY FIRST WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND OTHER FOLKS RUNNING OUR TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER SIGNIFICANT MONITORING AND MANAGING AND PORT SCANNING OF OUR NETWORK. SO HAVING THIS INTEGRATION TOUCH POINTS ALLOW WITH CLOUD SERVICES NOW THAT'LL. BASICALLY TERRAIN TO OUR FIRE ONE NETWORK. PUTS US IN A BETTER PLACE FROM A SECURITY POSTURE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO ASIDE FROM THAT TO THE INTEGRATION OF US COMPONENTS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE DATA INTEGRATION COMPONENTS WITH CAL SICK IN OUR PARTNERSHIP HERE AND WERE BEGINNING TO DO THE NECESSARY OUR RICH WAS CITY AND COUNTY REPRESENTATION. ON HOW WE CAN LOOK AT A COMMON STATEWIDE IT PLATFORM FOR SECURITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OUT OF THE PAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZING BILL TECHNOLOGY FROM A PLATFORM. FROM A CLOUD PERSPECTIVE AND ALLOWING NECESSARY FOLKS IN WHO CARRY THE HIGHEST DEGREES OF SECURITY CONTRACTIONS TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT. ANY TYPES OF MISSION CRITICAL ISSUES FROM HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. STOPPING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OPERATIONS WE TAKE THAT VERY IMPORTANT WE TAKE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO STRATEGICALLY AND ALSO TACTICALLY AS WE DEVELOP OUR PLAN. AS MENTIONED INFORMATION SECURITY IS OF THE SECOND QUADRANT AND OUR TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND DIRECTOR TOM AND I CONTINUE TO PROMOTE. INFORMATION SECURITY IS A CORE COMPONENT OF DIGITAL SERVICES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMPETENCY CAPABILITIES AND PROMOTION. SO ALL IN ALL THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HAVING A SOLID FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS PLAN IS KEY TO OUR SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD AND WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION. AS WE AFFECT THE RIGHT CHANGES HERE FOR OUR CITIZENS ON THE CUSTOMER'S GROUP CHAPTER CALIFORNIA. I'M GOING TO TURN THIS OVER NOW TO PETER LEAVE IT REALLY TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND HOW ARE NOT ACTING IN THIS IS SEARCHING WITHIN LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN SPONSOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MISTER LABOR. I DO. GOOD MORNING. DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE. I'M EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND. AND ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. AS YOU KNOW THERE TWO ARMS OF THE OFFICE INFORMATION SECURITY WHICH I WE'D WHICH FALLS UNDER. DIRECTOR TOM. IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE AN OPERATIONAL COMPONENT AND WE HAVE A POLICY IN OVERSIGHT COMPONENT AND I'LL START OFF WITH THE OPERATIONAL COMPONENT. AS IS MOST GERMANE TO THE TOPICS TODAY. WE'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE CDT SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER THE CT SOCK. I JUST I THINK ONE OF THE BIG ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'VE MADE IS THIS TIME THIS LAST YEAR. IT WAS JUST A CONCEPT. A. WITHIN A YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY AT WITH AND ACTUALLY FIVE MONTHS WE WILL STAND UP OUR FIRST CAPABILITY WITH IT. AND TODAY. WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN. IT'S CO STAFFED WITH BOTH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS CIVILIAN SERVICE. I AND IT'S EFFECTIVE WERE ON AVERAGE. IT FLUCTUATES OR BLOCKING APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION ATTACKS. MALICIOUS PROBES. PER DAY. WE ASK US FAR HAVE REVIEWED. APPROX ME HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND. SUSPICIOUS OFFENSE OR ALERTS. AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF A. INDICATION OF A TYPE OF. ATTACK OR TRAFFIC WHICH MAY BE. INDICATOR OF IT AN ATTACK. OUR FOLKS WILL ACTUALLY GO IN AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SO THE INVESTIGATE. SO SIGNIFICANT WORK EFFORT. AND IT'S. IT'S IT'S A PRETTY GOOD A STACK THE SHOW THAT WERE ACTUALLY SHOWING PROGRESS. BUT IS IT EFFECTIVE I WOULD SAY YES SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN JULY. WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED. AND HELPED. ENTITIES REMEDIATE EIGHTEEN DISTINCT MALICIOUS. ACTIONS OR EVENTS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS PREVIOUSLY. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SOCK INTO IS DESIGNED TO DO. IS TO HELP A STATEWIDE. DETECTION AND MONITORING CAPABILITY. INTO POWER. DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES. TO KNOW MONITORING NETWORKS AND ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T MISS ANYTHING. UNABLE TO REMEDIATE. YA MALICIOUS OFFENSE ASSUMES THAT CAR. ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THE SOCK IS WERE ACTUALLY STRATEGIC PARTNER WITH CAL SICK. AND WERE VERY EXCITED WITH THIS WE CAN JUST. INTELLIGENCE PROVIDED FROM CAL SICK WHICH IS A THREAT INTELLIGENCE FEED. IT'S COMBINED FEED AND STATE SPECIFIC. A DIRECTOR VERDUCCI HAD MENTIONED THERE ARE VERY FEW. STATES OUT THERE THAT CAN DO THIS I WOULD SAY. A VERY FEW IS A UNDERSTATEMENT. YEAH. AT DOT GOV SPECIFIC FEED. ALLOWS OUR INTELLIGENCE. OR ALLOWS OUR ANALYSTS TO UTILIZE CUSTOMIZED INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE THEIR JOB A LOT EASIER. BY BEING A STRATEGIC PARTNER WITH CAL SICK. WE IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE A ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ENTITIES AT THE NETWORK LEVEL. NOW BEING ABLE TO PASS ALERTS AND INFORMATION OVER TO CAL SICK. AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT. AND OUR ABILITY AS A STATE TO DETECT. MONITOR UMPIRE NETWORK TRAFFIC. ANOTHER ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS. IS REALLY DISTRESSING THAT. UP THERE A COUPLE FACTORS THAT. I WOULD MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF ONE. THIS IS A. MARATHON NOT A SPRINT SPECIAL INCOMES NETWORK DETECTION. AND OUR CAPABILITY THERE. OUR FOLKS ARE NEW. THEY STOOD UP IN JULY AYE BUT WE'VE INVEST A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT AND THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CAPABLE THEIR JOBS AS FAR. AND AS SOMETHING THAT. WILL BE CONTINUALLY ITERATING ON. MOVING FORWARD INCREASING WITH ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY. ADDITIONAL TRAINING. YOU KNOW AND AND AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS WE SEE OTHER NEED TO DO SO. SO I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS THERE ON ON THAT FRONT FOR SURE. SPEAKING TO OF THE POLICY AND OVERSIGHT A COMPONENT OF MY OFFICE. I WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THAT AS WELL. WE HAVE. EXPERIENCED A LOT OF GROWTH AGAIN IN THIS AREA AND IMPROVEMENT. FIRST ON THE POLICY SIDE. WE'VE LEVERAGED. THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF COMING FROM OF THE LEGISLATURE. US SUCH AS AB EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MAYBE TEN TWENTY. TO HELP IMPROVE OUR. TECHNOLOGY RECOVERY PLANS THIS IS THE PLAN THAT ALL ENTITIES IN THE STATE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE. DETAILS WHAT THEY DO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG THERE'S A DISRUPTION OR AN EVENT THAT IT KNOCKS OUT THERE ARE CRITICAL SYSTEMS. HOW DO THEY BRING US BACK ONLINE? THOSE TO. BILLS ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN IT BY. IT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CRITICAL SYSTEMS NOW. SPECIFICALLY DETAILED INTO THOSE REPORTS AND THEY HAVE. PLANS ON HOW TO REMEDIATE IN CASE THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT OCCURS WITH THEM. IT'S A IT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT. ALSO AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY THREE A DIRECTOR TOM MENTIONED THIS PREVIOUSLY. IT SECURITY SPENDING THIS IS THAT WE PUT OUT A POLICY ON THIS AS WELL REALLY LOOKING FORWARD STARTED GETTING DATA. THIS NEXT YEAR ON THIS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR US TO SEE HOW THE SECURITY SPENDING IS. GOING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS ENTITIES ARE ABLE THEN MATCH THAT UP WITH THEIR OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS MEASUREMENTS. AND TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF. BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE USING UTILIZING THEIR. FUNDS WISELY. AND HELPING THEM OUT IN PRIORITIZING IF IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. WE HAVE ALSO DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED OUR WORKFORCE AND TRAINING COMPONENT. OF MY OFFICE. SOME STATISTICS HERE WE'VE GONE FROM A APPROX WE TEACHING FIFTY SEVEN STUDENTS A YEAR AYE IN IT WHICH OR THE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICERS. AND THEIR SECURITY STAFF TO THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR OF THUS FAR IF. TAUGHT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOMAS THE THREEFOLD INCREASE MORE ACTION GOING THROUGH THAT EVEN FURTHER THIS YEAR. WE ALSO HELP FIFTEEN COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS. SINCE I'VE BEEN AT THE HELM. WITH ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS. SPANNING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES. OF THESE WORKSHOPS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP IMPROVE OUR POLICY AHEAD GET A COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON WHAT'S WORKING WHAT DOES NOT WORK. I AND WE'VE MADE DOZENS OF POLICY CORRECTIONS BASED OFF OF THEIR INPUT WHICH HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. AS DIRECTOR TRONG ALSO MENTIONED WERE PILED TEEN. US HE'S GONNA POLICY WE'RE ACTUALLY OF. PUTTING TOGETHER THIS YEAR IN INFORMATION SECURE TO LEADERSHIP ACADEMY. THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT THIS IS FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF A SOME GREAT EFFORT ALREADY. SUCH AS THE I. T. I'M LEADERSHIP ACADEMY HITLER. AND THIS WILL BE A. I BELIEVE FIVE WEEK OF COURSE. DESIGNED. SPECIFICALLY FOR. INFORMATION SECURITY LEADERS WITHIN THE STATE. INCLUDING AYE IF RESCUED OFFICERS AGENCY INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICERS AND STAFF LOOKING TO BE CAN FILL THOSE POSITIONS. AND COVERS A CRITICAL CORE. SKILL SET OF. NOT JUST HARD SECURITY SKILLS BUT ALSO LEADERSHIP AND. SOFT SKILLS SUCH AS HOW DO WE. YOUR AS A DIET SO HOW DO YOU BROADCAST THE BUSINESS LEADERS. THAT SECURITY IS IMPORTANT AND ENSURING THAT YOU HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY INCORPORATING THAT INTO YOUR STRATEGY. MOVE AFFORD. WILL BE CONTINUALLY EXPANDING OUR WORKFORCE AT ENGAGEMENT COMPONENTS. WITH ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS. ADDITIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. AND WERE VERY EXCITED FOR THAT. WERE ALSO A LOOKING TO PILOT. CERTAIN STATEWIDE AYE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS ANTI PHISHING TRAINING FOR THE STATE WE'RE LOOKING HOPEFULLY ROLE AYE A PALETTE OF THAT OUT THIS NEXT YEAR. AND WERE. REALLY EXCITED TO DO AS WELL. ON THE OVERSIGHT PORTION. WE HAVE TO. WINGS OF THE OVERSIGHT HOW WOULD YOU OVERSIGHT FOR STATE ENTITIES WE HAVE A. ASSESSMENT INDIVIDUAL. SECURITY OR INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT OR AN ISA. I WHICH WE'VE PARTNERED WITH A C. M. D. AND WE DO ALLOW THIRD PARTIES. TO TO I DO THAT AS WELL WITH THE ENTITIES IF THEY SO DESIRE. AND WE ALSO HAVE A POLICY BASED ON IT WHICH COMES ON MY OFFICE WHICH THE OUGHT WORKSHOPS. ARE SEEN IN THE OUR AUDIT OVERSIGHT BRANCH. HUGE AMOUNT OF IMPROVEMENT ON THIS AREA AS WELL I'M HAPPY TO SAY WE'VE MANAGED TO CUT THEM. TIME IT TAKES TO DO A POLICY AUDIT ARE ALMOST IN HALF. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW STREAMLINED THE PROCESS IS. WE'VE ALSO PUT TOGETHER A ADVISORY GROUP THAT HELPS A TRAIN NOW A MENTOR. ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION SECURE PROGRAMS TO HAVE. YEAH OR CABLE BILL MAKING. WE'VE GONE FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS WE WE'VE CONDUCTED ABOUT SIXTEEN. OR SEVENTEEN AUDITS THINK RUN TRACK FOR THIS YEAR. A COMBINED. SORRY THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR I'M I'M PLEASE TO SAY WERE AIMING TO DO FIFTEEN AUDITS AND FIFTEEN CHECK INS PER FISCAL YEAR. IT'S ALMOST TRIPLING THE CAPACITY OF ABOUT REACH TO THE ENTITIES OUT THERE. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT OUR TEAM HAS. HAS LED SOME VERY PLEASE TO REPORT THAT. THUS FAR WE FOUND APPROXIMATELY FOUR OR NOT PROBABLY WE FOUND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FINDINGS. ON THE POLICY SIDE OF HOUSE. THOSE ARE GAPS IN INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS THINGS THAT NO NEED TO IMPROVE CROSS THE STATE. AND DATA FROM THAT HAS HELPED US DEVELOP ACTUALLY THE FIRST EVER A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC CYBERSECURITY MATURITY METRIC I WHICH I BELIEVE. YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT EARLIER. THIS ALLOWS US TO QUANTITATIVELY. MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENTITIES ARE AND HOW THEY'RE DOING ON THEIR PERMISSION SECURITY PROGRAMS AT AN APPLES TO APPLES. BIGGER. COMPARISON. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHILE WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF PUTTING UP WITH THE BASELINE STANDARD IS. YOU KNOW FOR CYBERSECURITY AND REALLY TRYING TO GET FOLKS TO. BE EMPOWERED TO BUILD THAT OUT NOW RUSSIA CAN HAVE AN EFFECT MISS MEASUREMENT THE SAY ON A SCALE OF ONE FOR. YOUR DEPARTMENT MISSION BOARD ETCETERA RATES HERE. IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. BASED ON SPECIFIC METRICS PULLED FROM A LOT OF THE OVERSIGHT KEEP A CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES VERY HAVE. CMT AYE AYE ESSAYS AS WELL AS OUR OF OUR POLICY OF AUDITS. I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THE I SAY PROGRAM I'M RELIEVED MY COLLEAGUE SIXTEEN COLLEGE TO DO THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN THERE AS WELL IN WORKING WITH FOR CORD IMPROVING THAT. THIS LAST YEAR WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS FROM THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. SUMMARIZING CLOSING. AGAIN REITERATING. NOT THIS IS A MARATHON NOT A SPRINT. WE ARE WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED ON THIS AND AND. GOING BACK TO. THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED EARLIER WHAT WORKS WAS DOES NOT WHAT DOES NOT WORK. WHAT WORKS IS HAVING? FORUMS LIKE THIS INCREASED LEADERSHIP SUPPORT OF THROUGH DIRECTOR TRONG DIRECTOR GARY DUTY. YA SECRETARY BADGERING AND. YOU KNOW AND NOT GOTTEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO GET WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITHOUT THAT WE'VE NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE. AND. WERE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT WHAT DOES NOT WORK. THE STRATEGY WHICH WE'VE HAD OF THE STATE THUS FAR HAS BEEN. ISLANDS OF EXCELLENCE. THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT LEADS TO ISLANDS OF NEGLECT. WE'RE LOOKING TO NOT BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS AND MOVING FORWARD. AND. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE'RE DOING THIS NEXT OF THIS YEAR. IS PUTTING TOGETHER A OF LONG TERM STRATEGY WHICH FALLS UNDER THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY PLAN. OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS A STATE WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSECURITY HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO AND STATE WHAT IS AND STATE LOOK AT. WHERE RIGHT NOW ARE LOOK LIKE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS? FOR OR PARTNERS AND OUR. THE COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP NEVER HOPEFULLY ROLLING THAT OUT. THIS YEAR. AND. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING NOTHING GETS A KEY COMPONENT SPECIALTY TRY TO FIGURE OUT. DOESN'T FIT WITHIN THE BCP ARE THEY ASKING FOR THE RIGHT THINGS THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. TOGETHER COURSE QUESTIONS JUST ANSWERING THOSE QUICKLY. MISSING TOOLS ABSOLUTELY. BUT WERE AWARE OF IT AND THIS IS AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING TOWARDS. BLASPHEMY WANNA DO GOING TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION WHICHIS ARE THERE TOOLS WE DO NOT UTILIZE. IDENTIFYING THE TOOLS CAPABILITIES WE NEED AND THEN ITERATIVELY AND AND THOUGHTFULLY PUTTING TOGETHER STRATEGY OF HOW WE ROLL THOSE OUT WILL PREVENT US FROM HAVING TOOLS THEY JUST SIT ON THE SHELF. AND THAT'S OUR STRATEGY THUS FAR SPECIAL THE. SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL BE INCREASING CAPABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY. TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE OF THAT'LL THINK I I BELIEVE PASS IT OVER TO. THE TELFER MILITARY TARGET GIRL PARSONS TO ED WE THE WAY ON I SIX THINK THEIR MATCH. THE GOOD O'DONNELL COLONEL JIM PARSONS. THANKS SIR A GOOD MONEY MANAGER MADAM CHAIR CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MAJOR GENERAL NOLAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS MORNING. I WILL BE ADDRESSING THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND HOW THOSE HAVE BEEN GOING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. FOR STARTERS A SHORT OVERVIEW. AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT IS A VERY TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF AN AGENCIES SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. TO DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVELY THEY ARE MANAGING THOSE SYSTEMS AND THEIR CYBERSECURITY MATURITY. AS MR LABOR LIKES TO CALL IT. AND I WOULD AGREE SO. THINK THE CRITERIA THE CRITERIA THAT WE USE IN THESE ASSESSMENTS WE WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO DEVELOPING THOSE WITH THE. INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE OBVIOUSLY THE CHAU CONTROLS OR THE CI SO CONTROLS THOSE CRITERIA WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE CRITERIA TO MAKE THEM REPEATABLE AND TO GENERATE METRICS FOR WHICH WE CAN USE TO. GAUGE THE CYBERSECURITY MATURITY IN THE AGENCIES THAT WE VISITED. AND AS MR LABOR INDICATED MANY OF THOSE WILL. TIE RIGHT INTO HIS CYBERSECURITY METRICS THAT HE HAS DEVELOPED. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THEM MILITARY APARTMENT FOR THE SIMON OUR DEFENSE TEAM WE'VE BEEN TO APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ENTITIES. TWENTY THREE OF THOSE WAR A NONTRADITIONAL STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A C. ISSUE OR ACCOUNTING THOSE TYPES OF ENTITIES SO WE'VE BEEN TO A FEW OF THOSE. WE HAVE COMPLETED OVER A HUNDRED AYE ESSAYS TODAY AND SENSE. THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE'VE ANALYZED AND SCAN AND ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND STATE THAT. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO OUR PERSPECTIVE AFTER HAVING DONE THESE ASSESSMENTS. FROM AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL YOU'VE HEARD THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS TALK ABOUT THE CAL SICK AND THE CDT SOCK AND AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL THOSE ARE GREAT THEY REALLY HARDEN THE EXTERIOR THEY PROTECTED PERIMETER. AND THEY HAVE VISIBILITY TO THE INSIDE AND THAT'S CRITICAL. THAT IS DEFINITELY A COMPONENT THAT'S REQUIRED FROM AN ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE YOU ALSO HEARD ABOUT THE OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE MINUTES EMAIL DEPLOYMENT. AND ALL OF THE MAIL BOXES THAT GO IN THERE AND THAT IS AN ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT THAT REACHES EVERY SINGLE USER. SO EVERY USER'S MAILBOX. GAINES THE PROTECTIONS FROM THE OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE POLICIES AND. SECURITIES CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS ATTACKERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO COMPROMISE THE MONOLITHIC DATABASE WITH ALL THE HIGH TECH SECURITY CONTROLS AND MONITORING. THEY JUST NEED TO COMPROMISE THE USER. THE USER HAS ACCESS TO THAT DATA BECAUSE THE USER USES THAT DATA EVERYDAY SO THEY COMPROMISE A STANDARD USER AND THEN THEY GAIN ACCESS TO ALL THE DATA THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. SO FROM. MOST SECURITY PROFESSIONALS WOULD TELL YOU THAT THE PERIMETER REALLY HAS SHIFTED FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE NETWORK. TO EACH AND EVERY DESKTOP EACH AND EVERY USER IS NOW THE SECURITY FROM. SO PROTECTING EACH OF THOSE USERS AS YOU MENTIONED THIS MORNING MA'AM WE NEED TRAINING FOR THE USERS BECAUSE THERE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE THE WEAKEST LINK. SO THAT TAKES US TO INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES AND THE FOCUS OF THE AYE A SAY AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN THEIR. WE HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASE AND SENIOR LEADERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OR IN AGENCIES FOCUSING ON CYBERSECURITY THEY'RE MORE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S A HIGHER PRIORITY FOR THEM. SO THEY'RE WILLING TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO THINGS LIKE PATCHING WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. EQUIFAX I THINK WOULD TELL YOU THAT THEY REALLY WISH THEY HAD PATCH THAT APACHE STRUTS AFFORDABILITY. RIGHT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US THAT WISH THEY WERE TO PASS THAT. SO. PATCHING IS HARD. PATCHING SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE IT TAKES. NOT JUST PEOPLE IT TAKES THE RIGHT SECURITY PEOPLE TO MANAGE THOSE SYSTEMS AND TO PATCH ALL THE COMPUTERS AND ALL THE. THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PASSED SUCCESSFULLY SO IT'S A RESOURCE INTENSIVE PROCESS. AND I THINK AGENCIES ARE BECOMING AWARE. ESPECIALLY AFTER WE SCANNED THEM THAT THEY NEED TO APPLY RESOURCES TO THOSE TO TO PATCH THOSE ISSUES AND TO DO THAT PROCESS. AGAIN KIND OF IN THE WEEDS. WE'RE FINDING FEWER UNSUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS. WINDOWS XP IS FINALLY GOING AWAY STRAIGHT OUT OF SUPPORT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND IT'S FINALLY LEAVING THE NETWORKS THAT'S GREAT. WE ALSO HAVE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT A LOT OUT OF THE BOX CONFIGURATIONS WHERE AGENCIES ASSEMBLY. AND SAW THE OPERATING SYSTEM AND JUST GO WITH THAT THEY JUST LEAVE IT AS A KIND OF THE BOX. AND OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY CONFIGURED SO THEY WORK WELL FOR YOU AT HOME THEY'RE NOT USUALLY CONSIDER CONFIGURED VERY WELL TO WORK IN AN ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT. SO WHEN YOU GET A SYSTEM OUT OF THE OUT OF THE BOX AS IT WERE YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE IT TO BE SECURING ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT AND WE'RE FINDING THAT AGENCIES ARE ARE STARTING TO FOCUS ON. THAT'S A VERY GOOD FINING. I'M OLD AND MY EYES ARE FAMOUS. A. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO FIND RECENTLY IS WERE STARTING TO SEE ADVANCED. NEXT GENERATION AND A VIRUS ON THE IN POINTS. SO ANTI VIRUS TEN YEARS AGO WAS A SIGNATURE BASED EVENT WHERE. IT KNEW WHAT MOST OF THE VIRUSES LOOKED LIKE BASED ON. THE CONTENTS OF THE FILES AND IT WOULD JUST LOOK IN THE SIGNATURES TO SEE IF YOU HAD A VIRUS. I THINK THE NUMBER IS THERE ARE ON THE ORDER OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW. VIRUSES OR MALWARE SAMPLES EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES. SO THE SIGNATURE BASED AND IRIS ISN'T PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE ANYMORE. SO THAT ARE OURS THAT'S CAPABLE OF SPOTTING THINGS THAT IT HASN'T SEEN BEFORE IT'S CAPABLE OF PREVENTING EXECUTIONS OF. OR PREVENTING EXECUTION AND NOW WHERE. AND ALERTING CENTRALLY SO. AND DAY AND DAYS PASSED THE WORKSTATIONS ARE THE SYSTEMS ON THE NETWORK OR A BLACK HOLE. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE USER'S WORKSTATION? AND TELL WAS REALLY BAD NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA NO ONE SAW THAT THAT'S IN STATE GOVERNMENTS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD. IN THE PAST THAT WAS HUGE PROBLEM. NOW YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE EACH AND EVERY WORKSTATION. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE EACH WORKSTATION IS BECOMING THE PERIMETER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ATTACKERS ARE ATTACKING SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM ON EACH INDIVIDUAL WORKSTATION. THAT CAN DETECT THAT ACTIVITY AND REPORT IT TO A SECURITY ENGINEER THAT CAN RESPOND TO IT IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE AND AGENCIES WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE AT. AN ENTERPRISE ROLLOUT OF THAT. TO SEE. WHERE? THE CDT THAT THE CD TO SOCK THE CALTECH THOSE. ENTITIES CAN ACTUALLY SEE ON WORKSTATIONS WHAT'S HAPPENED. GO THAT MYSELF BOXER AND. SO AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH OUR INDEPENDENT SECURITY SYSTEMS WE GATHER A LOT OF DATA WE DO ALL THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE OFFER TO AGENCIES TO TRY AND ADD VALUE IS WE HAVE A COUPLE IS SECURITY ENGINEERS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT POLICY BASED. HARDENING OF SYSTEMS SO THAT WE WE OFFER TO GO BACK TO THE AGENCIES AND SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND TRY AND. WALK THEM DOWN THAT PATH THAT ALSO A COMPLICATED PATH TO STROLL DOWN. SO WE PROVIDE SUPPORT THAT WAY WE'VE HAD ELEVEN AGENCIES THAT HAVE TAKEN US UP ON THAT SO WE DO GO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO SOME AGENCIES AT THEIR REQUEST. AFTER WE'VE DONE THE ASSESSMENTS WITH THEM. AFTER THE ASSESSMENT COMPLETELY DONE WE'VE STARTED PROVIDING A SURVEY TO SEE HOW WE'VE. HOW WE'VE DONE IN THE IN THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND WHAT THE AGENCIES FEEDBACK WAS? SO FAR NINETY PERCENT OF THE AGENCIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TO HAVE SAID THAT WE. IN THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS HAVE HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CYBER RISK IN THEIR NETWORK. I THINK THAT'S GOOD THING IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE HE CAN'T FIX IT. AND AND. MY FINAL POINT WOULD BE. THE. COR FOR PARTNERS. WE GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH THE OTHER THREE PARTNERS AND I THINK THAT. AS MR LEAVITT SAID CYBERSECURITY. IT'S A IT'S A JOURNEY AND IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED JOURNEY UNFORTUNATELY CYBERSECURITY IS NOT A LINE ITEM ON A QUOTE IT'S NOT A CHECKBOX IT'S NOT A BINDER OVER IN THE CORNER. IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED AND IT'S A VERY LONG PATH. AND I THINK THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS WHO ARE WORKING VERY WELL TOGETHER AND ADDING ADDITIONAL PARTNERS IN THE PROCESS AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME STRIDES DOWN THAT PATH LETTER THAT WERE REALLY GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK. WE'RE. AND DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO PROTECT THE DATA THE CITIZENS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT LIEUTENANT COLONEL PARSONS A FINAL LET'S GO TO ALL THE LAST PRESENT AS SCOTT ALL HOLLAND WHO IS THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR. AND UP MEMBERS MY NAME'S CHIEF SCOTT HOW ONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND AND I BASICALLY WERE TWO HATS THE FIRST THAT IS AS CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C. H. P.'S IT. AND MAKE SURE WERE SECURE AND THEN THE SECOND HAT WHICH ACTUALLY SCARES THE GUY WITH THE FIRST THAT. IS OVERSEE OUR COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS UNIT BECAUSE I SEE ALL THE STUFF THAT GOES WRONG AND WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GO WRONG ON MY OWN NETWORK. BUT I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE I WANT TO START WITH PAINTING A PICTURE OF WHERE WE WERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY. BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT HOW WE APPROACH COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS WE BASICALLY WE GET A CALL OF MINUTES THAT. WE RESPOND TO THAT AGENCY WOULD INVESTIGATE THAT CRIME AND THEN CD TEASE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE WOULD BE NOTIFIED AND THEY TAKE A STEP. INFORMATION WE GAIN FROM AT INTELLIGENCE WE LEARNED DID NOT GO ANYWHERE. TODAY WHEN WE GET A CALL AS SOON AS WE START THAT INVESTIGATION IF WE HAVE ANY INTELLIGENCE THAT COULD BE A PHISHING EMAIL ADDRESS THAT WE NEED TO WHAT LOOK OUT FOR COULD BE A BAD WEBSITE. THAT INFORMATION GETS PUSHED OF THE CAL SICK WHICH THEN PUSHES OUT INCLUDING THE SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER SO PEOPLE CAN BE PROACTIVE AND WE CAN START DEFENDING OURSELVES RATHER THAN PLAYING CATCH UP WITH IT. AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THAT THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION HAS REALLY MOVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM A REACTIVE MODE. OF SOMETHING HAPPENED AND NOW WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP TO A THEY WERE GETTING INDICATORS OF SOMETHING GOING ON. WE NEED TO TAKE SOME ACTION AND WE HAVE THE PARTNERS IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AIM THAT ACTION AND A GREAT PART OF THE CAL SIC IS A SURE WAY BEYOND THE STATE ENTERPRISE LEVEL. AND SO ALL THE LOCAL PARTNERS AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE CAN GAIN THAT INFORMATION THAT WE SHARE. I I WANT TO SPEND MY TIME REALLY WALKING THROUGH SOME. STACKS AS FAR AS WHAT WE GET INVOLVED AND IN THE AC INCIDENTS THAT WE. INVESTIGATE AND I'M GONNA DO A COMPARISON BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO GIVE A GOOD IDEA THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING. BUT I THINK IT ALSO DOES A GOOD JOB PAINTING THE PICTURE OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING. SO. CALIFORNIA USES THE CALIFORNIA COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM THE CAL CAESAR SYSTEM TO START A TO MAKE NOTIFICATIONS OF INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT IS. ONLINE WITH THAT SYSTEM AND THE BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT THAT SYSTEM IS AS SOON AS A DEPARTMENT MAKES A REPORT THAT REPORT COMES TO THE CHP. IT GOES TO THE CAL SICK IT GOES TO TECHNOLOGY. EVERYBODY KNOWS AT THE SAME TIME THAT A DISSIDENT A STARTING NOW REALIZE WITHIN THAT SYSTEM IT MIGHT BE A PAPER BASED INFORMATION SECURITY LOSS IN WHICH CASE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE WOULD BE THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT. BUT THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY IF IT'S CRIMINAL WE WILL IMMEDIATELY JUMP ON BOARD WITH IT IF THERE'S FOLLOW UP OR INTELLIGENCE IN NEEDS TO BE SHARED. HOW SICK IS ON BOARD RIGHT AWAY KNOWING THAT HEY SOMETHING'S COMING AND THEN WE'RE TALKING AND SHARING THAT INFORMATION? AND SO AS WE LOOK AT THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID SEE AN INCREASE PLAN OVERALL CAL CAESAR'S REPORTS WE WENT FROM SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE TO EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT. BUT REMEMBER WITHIN THOSE REPORTS THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE PAPER LOSS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDES OF THEFT OR LOSS OF EQUIPMENT INCLUDING CELLPHONES. SO PURPOSES OF TODAY WHEN I CAN REALLY DO IS TAKE THAT THAT BIG GLOBAL. STATISTIC AND REALLY FOCUS ON FOR COOPER THREE CATEGORIES MALL WHERE INFECTIONS THAT HIT STATE COMPUTERS. A SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FISHING AND THE DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS AND I THINK THAT'LL PAIN A VERY GOOD PICTURE. SO WHEN WE DID GET TO THOSE KEY CATEGORIES ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD NEWS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR MALL WHERE INFECTIONS INFECTIONS ON STATE COMPUTERS WE SIDE DROP BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. WE WENT FROM FIFTY EIGHT. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TO FORTY THREE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I THINK IT'S AN INDICATOR OF PROGRESS AND ANY TIME YOU HAVE INFECTIONS GOING DOWN IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. SOME MORE GOOD NEWS AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY REALLY SIGNIFICANT WE SAW SEVENTY NINE PERCENT DECREASE IN RANSOMWARE SEVENTY NINE PERCENT WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE GLOBAL TREND HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR IT IS NOT BEEN PRETTY AND IT HAS BEEN ACCELERATING STRAIGHT UP. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE ACTUALLY AT TWENTY FOUR CASES OF RANSOMWARE ON STATE ASSETS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAD FIVE. I THINK THAT SHOWS GREAT PROGRESS. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SAY WERE DOWN IN ALL CATEGORIES WHICH TAKES ME TO SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FISHING AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE SURPRISED THAT THAT NUMBER IS NOT DOWN. AND IT WAS INTERESTING WE RECENTLY WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT FISHING IN THE FACT THAT ARE OUR NUMBER WAS UP AND WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE DEBATE ABOUT IS THAT A GOOD SIGN OR A BAD SIGN. BUT LET ME PUT FISHING IN CONTEXT I READ A REPORT RECENTLY THAT CAME FROM FISH ME. AND IT SAID IN THE LAST YEAR FISHING ATTEMPTS I'VE GONE UP SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. THAT IS A HUGE INCREASE AND TO PUT THAT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT IN CONTEXT. ANOTHER RECENT REPORT I READ IT SAYS THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. UNITS THAT'S THAT AGAIN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW FISHING SITES ESTABLISHED MONTHLY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PHISHING EMAILS OUT THERE THAT NUMBER IS BEEN INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY. WE'VE GONE UP THIRTY SIX PERCENT IN THE STATE. FROM THIRTY SIX THE FORTY NINE. VERY LOW NUMBERS. BUT WE DUG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN THAT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT OKAY. HOW MANY OF THOSE ACTUALLY RESULT IN INFECTION? IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAD THIRTY SIX REPORTED FISHING INCIDENTS TWENTY. OF THEM WORK RESULTED IN INFECTION. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD FORTY NINE INCIDENTS REPORTED HIGHER NUMBER. BUT ONLY EIGHTEEN MALL WHERE INFECTIONS. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT. FISHING IS GOING UP. BUT OUR INFECTIONS RESULTING FROM FISHING IS GOING DOWN. AND I THINK IT IT SHOWS THAT FOLKS ARE REPORTING MORE OFTEN. BUT THE REASON THEY'RE REPORTING MORE OFTEN IS THE REPORTING AND NOT FALLING VICTIM. AND ANY TIME WE CAN SAY REPORTING AND I'M FALLING VICTIM THAT IS REALLY GOOD. AND I THINK WHEN WHEN. THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS BEEN LOOKING AT THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS THEY'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A REDUCTION. IN THE NUMBER OF. FOLKS THAT FALL FOR THEIR FAKE% EMAIL SO THEY SENT TO TEST FOX. SO IT IT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE SEEN AS WE ACTUALLY SAW REDUCTION IN DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS WE WENT FROM FOUR TO THREE. VERY SMALL NUMBERS. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PUT ALL THIS IN PERSPECTIVE AND. I WAS READING A EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EUROPE WILL. REPORT FROM LATE LAST YEAR AND THEY SAID RANSOMWARE CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT MALL WHERE THREATS IN TERMS OF THE VARIETY AND RANGE OF ITS VICTIMS AND THE DAMAGE DONE. AND I DON'T THINK I NEED TO CONVINCE ANYBODY HERE OF THE DAMAGE THAT RANSOMWARE CAN DO. AT AND THEY HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE ATTACKS OF HIGHLIGHTED HOW CAN ACTIVITIES OR DIGITAL HYGIENE STANDARDS AND SECURITY PRACTICES CAN ALLOW SUCH A THREAT TO QUICKLY SPREAD. AND EXPAND THE ATTACK VECTOR. BUT WHEN YOU PUT THOSE NUMBERS IN CONTEXT. OF WHAT'S GOING ON WORLDWIDE WERE MAKING EXTREMELY GREAT PROGRESS WITH IT BUT IT ALSO REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACTIONS WE'RE TAKING IN CALIFORNIA. GOING BACK TO THOSE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE VULNERABILITIES OF WHERE FOLKS CAN GET AND SO WE CAN BE PROACTIVE AND CLOSE THOSE STORES. ANOTHER TREND THAT EUROPE OR THE EUROPOL REPORT POINTS OUT IS FISHING THE MOST COMMONLY FACILITATED THREATS WERE SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS AND CYBER FACILITATED FRAUDS SOME REPORTS SUGGEST ATTACKERS USE EMAIL TO CONTACT THEIR VICTIMS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME. IS THE EASY WAY TO GET IN AND ONE SAY SOMEONE GETS THEIR ALL LIFE THROUGH ITS CLICK. OR PROVIDE INFORMATION AND THEREIN. THE SCARIEST THING IS A CHAU OF KNOWING THAT I'VE WE'VE GOT ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE CHP AND ONLY TAKES ONE TO INVITE THE BAD GUY IN. WITH THE MANY MANY FISHING EMAILS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I ACTUALLY DO A COMPARISON AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CHP WORKS TIRELESSLY TO. EDUCATE OUR DRIVERS AS FAR AS THE DANGER OF TEXTING AND DRIVING TO MAKE OUR HIGHWAYS SAFER. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT FISHING EMAIL AND USER EDUCATION IN THE SAME WAY THAT IS NOT A ONE TIME FIX BUT IT'S AN ONGOING CAMPAIGN THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. BECAUSE THEY KEEP CHANGING ALL THEIR EMAILS MATTER FACT I GOT ONE JUST. TWO DAYS AGO THAT BASICALLY SAID ONE OF MY ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN LOCKED. AND IT WAS THE COMPANY LOGO WAS THE COMPANY TAXED IT LOOKED REALLY REALLY GOOD. THE THING THAT BECAUSE MY INITIAL BOSS I'D JUST BEEN ON THAT ACCOUNT AND I'M LIKE MY COUNTS NOT LOCKED. AND THEN I LOOKED A LITTLE DEEPER AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS A FISHING EMAIL. IT BUT AS WE TALKED EARLIER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT A ONE TIME FIXES AN ONGOING THING YOU SPEEDERS TERM IT'S REALLY A MARATHON. AND IT'S REALLY HAVING THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF PEOPLE PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY. AND THE EXCITING PART IS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH PEOPLE PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY TODAY IN THE PARTNERS ARE DOING A FABULOUS JOB OF DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE THINGS. I THINK BE OTHER PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO PROVIDE THIS MORNING IS FROM THE CHAU. THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ARE OCCURRING WITH THE FOUR CORE ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS WHEN I TALK TO MY PEERS OUT THERE. CIO'S ACROSS STATE DEPARTMENTS OR TAKING SECURITY SERIOUSLY. THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON IT AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING WHEN CIO'S HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO SAY HEY YOU HAVE TO BE CP LAST YEAR ON CYBERSECURITY. WHAT DID YOU DO BECAUSE I NEED TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR? WERE REALLY SHARING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED IN MAKING PROGRESS. AND AND I THINK THE OTHER OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT I KNOW THAT WHEN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT STARTED INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS I IT I CAN'T SAY THAT EVERYBODY WAS OPENED ARMS AND EXCITED ABOUT SOMEONE COMING IN AND DOING AN ASSESSMENT. BUT BUT I'VE USED AN ANALOGY WITH CIO'S THAT THEY SEEM TO REALLY HAVE ADOPTED AND BASED ON% THE MILITARY'S EXPERIENCE THEY REALLY HAVE. AYE I WAS DRIVING INTO WORK ONE DAY AND LOOK OVER AND I SAW A BIG RIG WITH A. GAS CAP. NO IT'S NOT A HIGHWAY PATROL THING LOOKING GAS CAPS ON ON FUEL TANKS BUT THE REASON THAT IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS IT WAS A LOCKING GAS CAP. HE WASN'T. SO WE HAD A TRUCKING COMPANY THAT NEW THE THREAT OF A FUEL THEFT. HAD PAID FOR A LOCKING GAS CAP BUT SOMEONE HAD LEFT THE KEY IN THE CASKET. AND I BET IF I ASK THE OWNER THAT IF THEY WANTED TO KEY IN THE GAS CAP HE WOULD HAVE SAID NO. WE NEED FIX THAT. BUT I THINK INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS ARE THE SAME THING IT PROVIDES DEPARTMENTS A ROADMAP TO SAY HATE TO HAVE A GAS CAP WITH A KEY IT. TO OUR DOOR THAT'S OPEN DRIVE SOMETHING IT WAS MIS CONFIGURED OR DID IT STAFF MISS SOMETHING OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. AND REALLY PUT IT ON THE ROAD MAP SO WE CAN FIX SOME. IT IT'S INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WITH IT. AND IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS WE HAVE AND WE JUST LOOK AT THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. A WE ASK THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS AND AND YOU SAW THE THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE THAT ARE EXECUTIVE LEVEL. THEY'RE ALL ON BOARD ALL SUPPORTIVE AND I GOTTA SAY THAT AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL. MY WIFE IS JEALOUS OF THE TIME WE SPEND TOGETHER. AND BUT BUT WE LAUGHED ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S PAID GREAT DIVIDENDS AND WE'VE SEEN THE PROGRESS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A TEAM THAT'S WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND I THINK I'D BE A MASSIVE WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE FOR SIDE OF THE GOVERNOR WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF GETTING THIS COLLABORATION STARTED. AND ALSO THANK THE COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY OUR OUR CO CHAIRS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR ROLE IN HOW YOU'VE HELPED US REALLY PROGRESS ALONG THE WAY. AND AS PETER SAID THIS IS A MARATHON. AND I THINK OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS REALLY AWARE THAT CYBERSECURITY IS NOT A ONE TIME FIX. IT'S A PROG A PROCESS AND WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON IT. BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS AND SAY OH YAK CHECK THAT BOX WERE DONE. WHEN WITH THE WAY THE THREAT IS CHANGING I MEAN SHOOT IN THE TIME WE'VE BEEN HERE TODAY HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT THREATS OF COME UP. THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND. APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT WITHOUT A LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS I BELIEVE UNCLE CHAIR WHEN YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION YOU WERE ALL VERY THOROUGH AND AND. ACTUALLY OF TWO QUESTIONS AND BOTH FOR. PETER. I WORK BUT THANK YOU FOR THOSE. THOROUGH PRESENTATIONS. TYPE ONE IT'S AN OCD TO GOING TO OFFER ASSISTANCE TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO ACHIEVE. AB TEN TWENTY TWO. INVENTORY. FROM A TRAINING AND. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY. YOU CRITICAL SYSTEMS AND I CERTAINLY. WE'VE ACTUALLY. REACH OUT TO. JUST. THEMSELVES AND LOOKING AT DOING A WORKSHOP ON HOPEFULLY. THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I SPECIFICALLY COVERING. HOW TO DO? DECLASSIFICATION WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF IDENTIFYING A CRITICAL SYSTEMS. AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE A ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS THIS YEAR ON THAT. TYPE OF ACTIVITY AS WELL AS BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS HOW YOU. IDENTIFYING THOSE SYSTEMS IS PARAMOUNT. SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT IT WITHIN THE HAVE THE. THE DOCUMENT ITSELF SO FROM THAT ASPECT YES. OKAY AND AND. AGAIN A LOT OF PROGRESS. AND THAT THIS PROBABLY PUT YOU A LITTLE BIT ON THE SPOT MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUDGET WHEN I LOOK AT THE ASSESSMENTS AND THE AUDITS IN THE PARTNERSHIPS AND YOU KNOW SWITCHING OVER TO. OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE WHICH OFTEN OBVIOUSLY THAT MAKES IT. FOR GETTING THE EXPERTISE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S GREAT AND ALL THE BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DEPARTMENTS BUT. WHY ARE YOU KNOW WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S DOING AIR DO YOU KNOW WHAT ANY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL? OFFICES ARE DOING ARE THEY BENEFITING FROM ALL THIS. EXPERIENCE WITH OVER THE. THAT'S GOING ON IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. YOU CAN'T ANSWER I UNDERSTOOD NO NO I I CAN I CAN GIVE A. GENERAL ANSWER. IF THERE ARE ACKNOWLEDGED GAPS IN TERMS OF WHAT MY OFFICE ARE OVERSEAS. THERE IS CONFLICTING. STATUTE. FOLKS CAN POINT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CITIES CAN POINT TO. A STATUTE SAYING THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT ENTIRELY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN JURISDICTION THINGS ON THOSE LINES. AND THEN WE CAN POINT TO THE SAME FIFTY THREE HUNDRED AND OUR STATUE AND SAY WELL. IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR THERE CERTAINLY GRAY AREA. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH LEADERSHIP. TO BRING MORE FOLKS IN. THAT IS ARE WHAT ARE IN THAT GRAY AREA. S. CERTAINLY SOME FLOWS. BUT WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING MAKE STRIDES IN THAT. AND I I WOULD NOT HAVE AN ANSWER ON. THE STATE LEGISLATURE MORE TAKE HEART WITH THAT. IT'S. FOR ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE GRAY AREAS LIKE A CALM THERE IT'S VOLUNTARY WIENER DEFTLY ENCOURAGE. FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE. OUR DOORS ARE OPEN. OUR POLICIES IS PUBLISHED. ARE METRIC IS GOING BE PUBLISHED I THINK THIS NEXT WEEK OR SO. WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO UTILIZE THAT IT'S A LOT OF EFFORT. THERE BUT WE WE DON'T COVER ONE. AYE AYE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CDT SOCK. HUGE MAN CAPABILITY WERE SEEN NOT USE ALL UTILIZING THE STATE WIDE AREA NETWORK I SEE JEN. I HAVE NO VISIBILITY INTO THEIR NETWORKS ARE SYSTEM. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. AND NOT EVERY ENTITY DOES THAT I UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES SO WE'RE CONTINUALLY TRIED TO BRING US FOLKS IN. AND BRING THEM OVER BUT. IT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE LIKE IT'S A HOME. AND TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION. FOR COMMANDER TRASH. IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU DISCUSSED THE SUCCESS THE DEPARTMENTS HAD IN ELIMINATING THE KASPERSKY. ANTIVIRUS PRODUCTS FROM STATE COMPUTERS AND I WONDERED ABOUT THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT YOU FOLLOWED AND IDENTIFYING THAT AS A THREAT DID YOU MAKE YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT OR DID YOU RELY ON. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND IDENTIFYING THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT. A VERY GOOD QUESTION I'M IT WAS. A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING BECAUSE ONCE WE SAW WE NOW UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED. DATA SO WHAT WE HAD BEEN SEEN WAS OF A LOT OF TALKING AROUND THE SUBJECT IN SAYING IT IT LOOKS BAD AND AND THAT KIND OF THING. SO WHEN WE FINALLY SAW WHAT WHAT WOULD THE PIVOT POINT WAS IS GSA. FEDERAL GSA HAD OF HAD A A. PRESS CONFERENCE. TO TO SAY THEY'RE TAKING BECAUSE PERSKY OFF OF THEIR LIST AND THAT RAISE RED FLAGS WITH US SO AT THAT POINT. ME MY MY ANALYSTS LIKE WE STARTED TALKING TO D. H. US AND I'D THE DOD WE HAD. WHO CAN CALL PARSONS OF HIS FOLKS CHECK ON THE DOD SIDE HAD YOU WE HAVE HIGH CIDER CLASSIFIED INFORMATION? THAT IS IS MORE YOU KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY MORE PINPOINTED AND IN FACT THERE WAS. WE WERE ABLE TO TALK THROUGH THAT WITH DHS AND GET ENOUGH INFORMATION. DOWN AT THE FORUM FOR OF A OF A FISH USE ONLY LEVEL TO ACTUALLY SAY THERE WAS SOME SPECIFIC AND REAL THREATS THERE. SO WITH THAT I TOOK THAT TO MY DIRECTOR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT. AT THAT POINT I FELT IT WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAD AND I ASK DIRECTOR TONG AND DIRECTOR GALLUCCI. TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT BUT ONCE WE ALL TALK ABOUT IT OF OF THE COLLECTIVE YES WE NEED TO RESIST TO A HIGHER LEVEL. SO THERE ARE. OTHER. SENSITIVE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE BY COMPANIES WITH TIES TO RUSSIA. THE FOR EXAMPLE A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK SOFTWARE BUT YOU HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF PRODUCTS. WE DO. AND THAT THE CHALLENGE WE FACE RIGHT NOW IS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT THEY HAD AS KASPERSKY DEAD AND WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT DAILY AND I MEAN DALY. AYE WE LOOK FOR THAT WE ARE A CONSISTENTLY LOOKING AT THE CLASSIFIED REPORTS AND TALKING TO OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS. TO ENSURE THAT ONCE IF WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIFIC THAT WE ACT ON IT RIGHT AWAY. ANOTHER QUESTION FOR MISTER HOWLAND. IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU WERE DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE METRICS ARE TRAINING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION EXCEPT THOSE FOR FISHING ALTHOUGH. I FISHING ATTACKS. SUCCESSFUL FISHING TAX ARE UP THEY ARE UP TO THE EXTENT THAT. OVERALL PHISHING ATTACKS ARE AND SO THAT'S KIND OF GOOD NEWS AS WELL. HOWEVER I REQUEST ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING ON THAT METRIC BECAUSE. BY DEFINITION IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FISHING ATTACK YOU ONLY KNOW ABOUT IT IF SOMEONE. SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZES IT AS AN ATTACK YOU KNOW BY DEFINITE WIN OR THEY'RE UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE ATTACK RESULTS IN AN INFECTION THAN LEADER YOU CAN. I DO A POSTMORTEM AND DETERMINE THAT THE INFECTION WAS A RESULT OF THE FISHING EMAIL. A BUT OTHER IS NOT A NO QUESTION ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY IS YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT A LARGE CATEGORY OF USERS THAT DIDN'T SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZES A TAXI WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE. AND THEN SECOND OF ALL SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS WILL BE AFTER THINGS LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T DETECT LATER LOOK FOR EXAMPLE LAST PERSONAL INFORMATION OR PASSWORDS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT DON'T RESULT IN AN INFECTION THAT THAT YOU CAN TRACE BACK TO THE EMAIL SO I WONDER HOW YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE IN THOSE METRICS WHEN THOSE. THOSE PROBLEMS ARE ARE EXTENT SO THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE UNKNOWN YOU'RE CORRECT ON THAT ABSOLUTELY. THOSE METRICS ARE BASED ON CAL CAESAR'S REPORTS ACTUALLY REPORTED EVENTS AND SO WHENWE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF REPORTED FISHING EVENTS. UP AND THEN WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF. MALL WHERE INFECTIONS THAT WERE RELATED TO PHISHING ATTACKS AS FAR AS THOSE NUMBERS SO DID WE CAPTURE HUNDRED PERCENT. NO ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT I THINK WHEN IT'S THE REALLY THAT MALL WHERE INFECTION IS PROBABLY THE MOST ACCURATE ONE. BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN AND THERE IS. CAO CAESAR'S REPORT AND WE DO INVESTIGATE WE WERE LOOKING AT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AND FISH ITSELF OKAY WELL THE REASON I'M INTERESTED IS BECAUSE I THINK THE. INFECTION IS THE EASIEST. THING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO MALWARE BECAUSE I'M SORRY A PHISHING ATTACKS BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE HAD AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL CAN INFLUENCE THE ABILITY OF THE USER TO DO THINGS THAT AFFECT THE SYSTEM BUT. YOU KNOW THE OTHER TYPES OF PHISHING ATTACKS WE REALLY HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER AND IF THE USER IS GOING TO. PUT. SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE A PASSWORD. YOU KNOW THROUGH THE IN RESPONSE TO FISHING ATTACK IN A WEEK WE HAVE A LOT LESS. INFLUENCE OVER THAT THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS EDUCATE SO I THINK THOSE ARE MORE A LOT MORE PROBLEMATIC TO DEAL WITH OH OH ABSOLUTELY IN YOU WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR INCIDENTS WE WE HAD A VARIETY OF INCIDENTS THEY INCLUDED AN INFECTION ON. A DESKTOP IT UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE GAVE UP CREDENTIALS AND THEN YOU HAVE ME MUCH MAILBOXES TAKEN OVER AND THEN YOU'RE CHASING THAT. IT BECOMES A MUCH BIGGER INCIDENT SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON YOU KNOW IF WE CAN GET USERS. TO NOT DO THAT CLICK I CALL MY* IF WE GET THE THE CLICKERS NOT TO CLICK AND FOLKS NOT TO PROVIDE CREDENTIALS IT PIT STOPS IT THERE BUT AS WE TALKED EARLIER IT'S. HOW DO WE COMBINE TECHNOLOGY TO STOP IT STOP IT FROM GETTING TO THE USER IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT MAKES OUR USERS ARE WELL EDUCATED BECAUSE? TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO GO ON A PERCENT OF A. AND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE REALLY SMART AND IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT JUST THAT THE VOLUME OF EMAILS WE ALL GET. WE WE CRANK THEIR EMAILS WERE JUST TRYING TO GET IT DONE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ALL TAKE THE TIME WE NEED TO VERIFY THAT. THAT REQUEST THE CLICK ON A LINK FOR THAT REQUEST FOR A CREDENTIAL. WHERE WE GET INTO THE BIGGEST TROUBLE IS LEGITIMATE? AND SOMETIMES WE'RE JUST ON AUTOPILOT AND BOOM WE GO IN AND BAD THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN IT'S WE NOW HAVE AN INSTANT TO DEAL WITH PER. ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND IF I MAY I I JUST DON'T WANT ADDITIONAL A COMPONENT TO THAT. BUT THIS IS ALSO WHY WE LAYERED DEFENSES AND DETECTION. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. NEO FISHING EMAILS. STUFF GETS THROUGH. THIS IS WHY WERE I DO INTERNAL STANDS DOING THAT LARRY TEXAN CAPABILITY WITHIN THE STATE YOU PUT THROUGH SOCK. AS WELL AS. HAVE DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES REQUIRED TO TO MONITOR ON NETWORKS IN LAW HAVE LONG MANAGEMENT. SO THAT. IF THERE IS A CREDENTIAL THEFT WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY RESULT AND FACTION. YOU'RE GONNA SEE HOPEFULLY THE ACTIVITY RESULTING FROM THAT MISUSE OF CREDENTIALS AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES SO BY LAYERING THOSE DEFENSES YOUR DISK IN REDUCING THE RISK AT LEAST SO IF SOMEONE DOES PROVIDE INFORMATION. YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I THINK. FIREEYE PUBLISHED. STATISTICALLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO THURMOND DID REPORT THAT I'M OUT OF ALL THE BREACHES THEY INVESTIGATED. WAS ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEM HAD. UP TODAY ANTI VIRUS. BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE BRIDGES ARE FROM CREDENTIAL THEFT AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES SO. WE'RE HOPING THAT ARE TEXAS STRATEGY IS IS PROVIDING THAT ARE LEAST ALLOWING US DETECT OUT QUICKLY AND RESPOND TO. INTERESTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. IF I MAY GO TO OF COMMENDED TRASH FIRST IN. COMMAND TRASHY TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OUT REACH PROGRAM WAR OF. OVER FIVE HUNDRED ENTITIES ARE LOCAL OMINOUS PALLISER. VIA BICU ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM SO LET ME FIRST OFF COME ON. A COMMAND YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE IT IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE LOOKING TO DO AND THAT'S COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCALS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARM. NOW MY QUESTION IS OF THEIR FIVE HUNDRED. OR ENTITIES OR INDIVIDUALS ARE IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE THE STATE WHAT ARE SOME THE TYPICAL INCIDENTS OR ARE THINGS THAT THEY NEED HELP. WITH. I AM. VERY GOOD QUESTION. A. WELL AS I SAID IN MY MY A STATEMENT. THEY CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM WEBSITE DEFACE HURTS A LOT OF TIMES WILL ACTUALLY GET INFORMATION OF A WEBSITE DEFACE MEN IN THE REASON WHY SOME OF THESE FOLKS ON NOBODY IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE FRONT PAGE. IT'S ONE OF THEIR BACK PAGES OR ONE OF THE SECONDARY OUR THIRD PAGES SO GET THIS INFORMATION AND WILL CALL AND SAY HEY YOU BETTER WEBSITE DEFACE MINIMAL SELL WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT. AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO FIND IT BUT WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF LARGE CITIES IN THIS ONE IS A LITTLE SCARY BUT WE GOT A COUPLE LARGE CITIES THAT. THEY HAVEN'T BOUGHT INTO THE WHOLE. GET MY HEAD OF SAND. THERE WHAT IT THERE'S A LARGE CITY IN THE. SUCH CALIFORNIA THAT HAS HAD ISSUES WITH FISHING AND MALWARE ATTACKS THAT THEY'VE COULD ACTUALLY CALLED US AND SAID HEY. A CAN YOU LOOK AT THIS STRING FORCE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT AND WE'VE SAID. YET THAT'S FROM CHINA. SO SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT I AM WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH COMPONENT AND YOU KNOW THEIR SYSTEMS ARE MUCH MORE OPEN BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM TO BE OPEN TO TO DO RESEARCH SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME I I'M INTO THE TERM BOTNET ACTIVITY. SO WHAT HAPPENS S A LOT OF THE COMPUTERS THAT ARE ON THEIR NETWORKS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER. AND THEN ARE BEING USED AS KIND OF A CHAIN TO DO OTHER TYPE OF NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. A COLON UP YEAH I SEE ISSUE EDU A AND ET USED CATER TWELVE. AND SAY HEY YOU GOT SOME. THESE COMPUTERS THAT ARE AYE INFECTED AND THEY GO BACK IN THE OLD YEP AND THEY HAVE A FIX OF. SO IT RANGES AND AND THINGS. WE'VE WE DO YOU KNOW I WANT TO TAKE ALL AND NOT HIGHLIGHT FISHING. AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THIS. THERE'S BEEN A A VERY YOU KNOW. THE FIERY ALSO WHEN THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE REPORTS IT SAID PHISHING. ATTACKS TRENDS FOR THIS YEAR ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO GET LARGER. AND IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RULES OF ENGAGEMENTS OUTSIDE SOMEONE MENTION WHAT KIND OF ACTORS I THINK WAS YOU ON. IF SOMEONE CHAU ABOUT WHAT KIND OF ACTORS. IN OUR NATION STATES NATION STATES THAT YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE OF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WE DO THEY DON'T. AND IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING CAUGHT OR IF THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WHY STOP. SO THE POINT IS IN AND WITH THE LAYERED APPROACH WITH THE TEAM APPROACH THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEE STUFF AT. STATE LEVEL AND SEEING AND STATE ENTITIES OR IF I SEE IT IN THE EDUCATION OR THE BANKING SECTOR. TO PASS THAT INFORMATION OVER TO PETER AND HIS FOLKS SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT LATER APPROACHES START LOOKING MORE ACTIVELY AT THAT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ALSO LARGELY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO NOT JUST TAKE THAT THREAT INFORMATION WERE GIVING IT BUT THE CORRELATED AND SAY THIS DATA. DIFFICULT LOOKS AT EDUCATION SECTOR AND THEN TALK TO THEM SPECIFICALLY SO. I'M A IN ENCLOSING ON THAT PIECE IT IS THERE'S THERE'S A GAMUT OF IT I WOULD TELL YOU PROBABLY THE BIGGEST. AMOUNT IS IS WEBSITE DEFACE MINTS AND. THE. BUTTON AND ACTIVITY SO WOULD IT BE CORRECT TO SAY THAT. DIS IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE NO SAFEGUARDS AGAINST CYBERATTACKS WHATSOEVER DO THEY HAVE A LITTLE MINIMAL LEVEL OF FUN. YES REGARDS IT AND WHAT YOU NORMALLY FIND SIR IS THAT THESE ARE THE. THE EITHER THE THE COMPUTERS IN THE RESEARCH LAB. BECAUSE THEY THEIR THEY HAVE LOW WERE. DEFENSES ON THEM THEN THEY WOULD LIKE ON THAT ON A FACULTY MEMBER AND AND ON THE NETWORK ON THEIR IT'S MORE OF THE RESEARCH CAPABILITY ONES THAT HAVE A IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T. THEY JUST HAVE MINIMAL. NO THE OBJECTIVE OBVIOUSLY IS TO CAN REACH OUT TO MORE OF THESE US ENTITIES TO BASICALLY PROVIDE HELP. I'M SU IF THAT IS THE CASE IN A WOULD THE DEPARTMENT BE ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THAT. ARE OUT REACH PROGRAM OR WAS THAT OREGON DE BEING DONE NOW IS THAT YES THAT THAT'S THE THE PLAN THAT DUMB WE HAVE THAT TIME I'VE WORKED WITH DIRECTOR GALLUCCI ON. WHERE YOU KNOW AS WE ARE? GAINING GROUND IN GIVING MORE OF THOSE. PARTNERS IF YOU WILL EDNA WORKING THROUGH THAT BUSINESS PLAN TO SHOW THAT THIS IS BEING EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW AND QUITE FRANKLY I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW. THAT WE'RE MAKING NO PROGRESS AND HERE'S WHY WE NEED MORE RESOURCES BUT YES WE'VE TALKED A DIRT OF THE DIRECTOR ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DIRECTOR A CRUISE I HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CLOUT WILL YOU REFERRING. TO THE. CAO CLUB. YES IT WAS CALCLOUD NOW ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITION A GOVERNMENT CLOUD SERVICES COMMERCIAL CLOSER TO YOU IN GENERAL ARE. FROM A. ON CYBERSECURITY STANDPOINT WOOD UC FIREWOOD CAO CLOUT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OR WOOD CALCLOUD PROVIDE THE MOST. ON SAFE ENVIRONMENT. FOR A STATE AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE OFF FROM A CYBERSECURITY STANDPOINT AYE YES IN FACT WE'VE. ESTABLISHING CAME OUT THE TECHNOLOGY LETTER LAST YEAR THAT MANDATES THAT REALLY FOR GOING TO USE COMMERCIAL CLOUD SERVICES DOES NOT ONLY NEED TO BE PROCURED THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR INTERCONNECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. SIGN UP. ON OUR STATEWIDE NETWORK OR THROUGH OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER SO WE CAN MONITOR AND MANAGE MALICIOUS ACTIVITY AS IT COMES THROUGH SO THAT IS NOW A TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE STATE. PROVOKES UNDER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH GOT IT NOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL. AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA USE CALCLOUD SO WHAT IS THE BREAKDOWN. THAT. LET'S A PERCENTAGE WISE HOW HOMIES AGE STATE AGENCIES ARE USING SOMETHING OTHER THAN CAO CLOUT WELL THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE USING COMMERCIAL CLOUT OUTSIDE OF OUR INTER CONNECTED BODIES THAT WERE SLOWLY BUT SURELY HAVING DIALOGUE WITH THEM. I'M TALKING ABOUT POLICY AND HOW WE WANT EFFECTUATE THE RIGHT TYPES OF CHANGES TO SAY HEY IF YOU PURCHASE THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW ARE YOU GONNA GET COST CONTAINMENT AND STATE BEST VALUE BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SECURITY POSTURE. THAT WE CAN OFFER NOT ONLY TO OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER BUT THROUGH OUR CORE AND FOR SURE. WERE ALSO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER STARTING HOW DIALOGUE WITH CITY AND COUNTY CIO'S ON HOW THEY CAN LEVERAGE OUR CLOUD SERVICES. SO WE HAVING OTHER AYE AYE CLOUD AYE OF BEER INVITATION FOR A BIT ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE ASKING THE COUNTY TO COME PARTICIPATE WITH US DURING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VENDORS SO THERE IS I THINK AN ELEMENT OF. SINCERITY WITH THE COUNTY SAW CIO'S AS WELL AS THE EYE OF SO COMMUNITIES TO START LOOKING OUT OF STANDARDIZING IT PLATFORM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ADDRESSES THE NECESSARY SECURITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. GOTTA THANK YOU MISTER LIEBER YOU'D DO A CITED SOME NUMBERS. I THINK YOU SAID THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF. THE TAX. MADEO THEREABOUTS IN IN OF WHICH A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND WERE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SUSPICIOUS. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER. THE MAJORITY OF THE THE THE ATTEMPTS. WERE TARGETING PARTICULAR SECTORS EXAMPLE WHETHER ITS FINANCIAL SECTOR. LET'S SAY THE ELECTION SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE ANY ANY ANY DUE TO SEE A TREND AS TO WHAT KIND OF ATTACKS THAT YOU KNOW OF ALL THESE ARE. BAD ACTORS ARE. DOING FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE YOU KNOW WHAT. I BELIEVE THAT. SO I I CAN SAY THAT. FOR THOSE THAT ARE YOU CAN UTILIZING SIEGE AND WE HAVE THE THAT STAT APPLIES NAM. A LOT OF THE. ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR SO. WE GIVE THAT STATISTIC THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. PER DAY AT SUCH A BLOCKED ATTEMPTS AND SO. BECAUSE THEY'RE BLOCKED YOU WON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE INTENT IS ABOUT THE COMING FROM SUSPICIOUS SITES TO HAVE THAT CERTAIN TYPE TRAFFIC PATTERN THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. SO WE DON'T EVEN LET HIM THROUGH THE DOOR IF YOU WELL. I'M VERY HARD TO GET. STATISTICS ON THAT BECAUSE WE WE BALK AT ITS SOURCE. BOB THE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND. STATISTIC WHICH IS C. A SUSPICIOUS EVENTS THAT WE'VE ANALYZED. IS THAT'S THE TRAFFIC THAT GETS TO THE DOOR BUT STILL LOOKS A LITTLE FUNKY WANNA DO SOME ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS. MALICIOUS. SO BASED OFF OF THAT. I WOULD SAY THE THE SPLIT IS. AYE I'LL HAVE PARTS OF HIS DICK BUT IT'S IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD WE SEE. DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPLOITS BEEN ATTEMPTED WE'VE SEEN. SOME KNOWN PAST KNOWN. EXPLOITS YOU SEE THINGS LIKE HEART BELIEVE BEING ATTEMPTED. WHICH IS. AN OLD VULNERABILITY. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE REASON FOR THAT MY OPINION IS THAT MAJORITY OF THIS IS AUTOMATED. ON ITS YOU KNOW SCRIPTS BEING RUN BY. YOU KNOW FOLKS OUT THERE AND DIFFERENT. EVEN IN THE U. S.. WITH MALICIOUS INTENT. BETTER JUST HAMMERING AWAY WITH WHATEVER THEY CAN IF THEY GET A INDICATOR BACK THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BREAK INTO. WILL FLIP A SWITCH AND GO FOR IT. CERTAINLY OTHER ARE SOME TARGETED ATTACKS. BUT I DON'T HAVE THE. SPLIT ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY TERMS OF STATISTICS DID YOU SEE ANY ATTACKS ON OUR OUR VOTING SYSTEM WHATSOEVER ELECTION VOTING SYSTEM WHATSOEVER. I'M NOT DOES I TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS YOU GEN NETWORK SO I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS BUILDING. GOT IT GOT PARED IT DOWN. I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS.
