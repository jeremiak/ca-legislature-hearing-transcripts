00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.863
COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN. A

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.931
REAL LACK OF EQUITY WHEN IT

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:02.866
COMES TO VACCINE THAT HAS

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:04.534
CONTINUED TO BE A PART OF HE

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:07.470
CONVERSATION AND- YOU KNOW MANY

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.239
OF THE REASONS CONTINUE TO BE

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:11.341
LACK OF A SMARTPHONE LACK OF

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.543
INTERNET ACCESS BY A LACK OF

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.278
RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION MANY

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.180
LATINO ESSENTIAL WORKERS USE

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.481
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:21.851
TO. THE LARGER SITES IN IN A

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:22.852
AND DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.254
LARGER SITES LIKE DODGER

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.889
STADIUM MARC ARE CAL STATE LA

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:28.091
WHICH ARE BOTH IN MY COMMUNITY

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.959
AND THERE'S BEEN A HUGE

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:32.262
DISCREPANCIES WITH SOME CODES

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.997
THAT WERE USED NOT BY THE LOCAL

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.699
COMMUNITY BUT OTHER COMMUNITIES

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.600
COMING INTO EAST LOS ANGELES

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.135
ANY SIDE COMMUNITIES TO GET THE

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:41.738
VACCINE. SO I'M I'M WONDERING

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.840
WHAT ARE THE STEPS NECESSARY

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:44.808
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO ENSURE

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:47.243
THAT FOLKS THAT HAVE LANGUAGE

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.179
BARRIERS LACK OF INTERNET LACK

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:51.748
OF SMARTPHONES LACK RELIABLE

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:52.682
TRANSPORTATION WHO USE PUBLIC

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:56.086
TRANSIT. TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:58.888
VACCINE. SO I THINK THERE ARE A

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:01.791
NUMBER OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY I

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:02.992
TALKED ABOUT MANY OF THEM- IN

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:05.495
MY- OPENING REMARKS BUT JUST TO

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.697
RECAP A LITTLE BIT. I THINK ONE

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:09.099
IS THAT EVERY COUNTY HAS NOW

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.900
CREATED A VACCINE EQUITY POUND

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:13.303
PLAN INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:14.838
IT DOES DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:17.073
TRANSPORTATION. ACCESS BEING

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.743
ABLE TO YOU I'M HAVE CLINICS

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.478
THAT HAVE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.779
APPOINTMENTS SO MY TURN HAS

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.814
FEATURES SUCH AS A PHONE NUMBER

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:27.016
YOU CAN CALL- I KNOW L. A.

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.852
COUNTY IS WORKING TO SET UP.

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:31.054
MANY MORE CLINICS IN IN

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.722
DIFFERENT AREAS SO THAT THEY

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:34.057
HAVE MOBILE CLINICS THEY HAVE

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.726
WAYS OF. EXPANDING OUT THERE

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:39.596
REACH I'M AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:40.997
A GREAT DEAL OF WORK BEING DONE

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.699
ON OUR REGION EDUCATION THROUGH

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:43.500
OUR COMMUNITY BASED

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.235
ORGANIZATIONS. THAT COUNTIES

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:48.404
HAVE RECEIVED DOLLARS- FROM DOT

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.707
IBM LAB CAPACITY GRANT AS WELL

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:54.244
AS THEIR IMMUNIZATION. GRANT TO

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.812
HELP TO PAY FOR THESE. I'M CBO

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:56.546
IS TO HELP TO PAY FOR

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.248
TRANSPORTATION AND THINGS LIKE

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.382
THAT SO I THINK THERE ARE A

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.817
NUMBER OF THINGS UNDER WAY

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:03.086
WE'VE ALSO BEEN. PUTTING ON

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.789
SOME MAJOR SITES AND LA IS

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.490
INCLUDED IN THAT EFFORT TO TRY

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.826
TO REACH OUT AND PROVIDE ACCESS

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.427
TO THOSE. TWO POPULATIONS THAT

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:14.330
ARE HARDER TO REACH. I'M TRYING

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.365
TO THINK OF GOING THROUGH MY

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.700
NOTES TO GET AS MANY OF THE-

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.235
ISSUES UNDER WAY I KNOW THAT WE

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.470
ARE WORKING WITH PROVIDERS AS

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:22.272
WELL TO OFFER SOME OF THOSE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:23.640
INCENTIVES AND TO MAKE SURE

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.742
THAT WE HAVE. ON GOOD

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.043
TRANSPORTATION FOR PEOPLE OR

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.045
THAT WE ARE PLACING MOBILE

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.647
CLINICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:31.681
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE MAY NOT

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.083
HAVE- ON THAT GOOD ACCESS

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.618
WITHOUT YOU KNOW USING.

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.453
MULTIPLE FORMS OF PUBLIC PUBLIC

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.555
TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO THE

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.290
SITE SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.224
SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:44.294
LOCATIONS WITHIN A RADIUS OF-

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.264
THESE POPULATION SO THAT

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:48.832
THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO TRAVEL

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:51.067
VERY FAR. HAS WHAT HAS BEEN THE

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:51.935
OF JUST TO FOLLOW UP MISTER

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.403
CHAIR THAT'S OKAY- WHAT HAS

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.572
BEEN THE REASON WHY WE HAVE NOT

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:57.173
BEEN ABLE TO PARTNER SOONER.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.409
WITH ENTITIES LIKE A LOCAL

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.311
SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WHICH ARE

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:03.346
TRUSTED CENTERS IN COMMUNITIES

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:05.215
WHERE WE KNOW. THAT ESSENTIAL

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:07.183
WORKERS SEND THEIR CHILDREN'S

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.252
TO ESPECIALLY AS WE CONSIDER.

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.120
RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS I

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.922
REPRESENT L. A. U. S. T. WE

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.424
HAVE BEEN IN. CONSTANT

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.459
COMMUNICATION IN TERMS OF. HOW

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:18.027
CAN WE GET VACCINES INTO

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.330
PEOPLE'S ARMS WHEN ONE THERE IS

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:21.998
ISSUES OF TRUST THERE'S ISSUES

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:24.033
OF TRANSPORTATION ACCESS THAT

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.236
CETERA. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:27.637
TO WHY WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.538
WHY THE STATE HAS NOT LOOKED AT

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.273
OPPORTUNITIES. WHERE THE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.641
COMMUNITY CLINICS OR WITH LOCAL

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.343
SCHOOLS TO BE USED AS TRUSTED

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.645
CENTERS WHERE OUR COMMUNITY CAN

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:39.215
CAN GO NOT ONLY. GET TESTED BUT

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.550
ALSO GET THE VACCINE. SO WE'LL

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:41.618
START WITH THERE'S A LOT OF

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.419
WORK IN ONGOING WORK WITH

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:44.454
COMMUNITY CLINICS MANY OF OUR

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.555
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.690
PARTNERED FROM THE GET GO WITH-

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:49.759
THESE CLINICS. I HAD THINK THAT

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:51.294
IS BALANCED BY THE FACT THAT WE

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.096
HAVE NOT HAD MUCH IN THE WAY M.

00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:55.331
VACCINE- YEAH WE HAVEN'T HAD

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:56.833
THAT MUCH VACCINE AND SO WE'VE

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.701
TRIED TO YOU. KNOW MAKE SURE

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.870
THAT WE CAN GET ENOUGH VACCINE

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:02.505
IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDERS SO

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:03.973
THAT THEY CAN HOLD THESE

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.609
CLINICS AND THAT- SO WE'RE JUST

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.245
NOW EXPANDING NOT AS WE SEE. AN

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.481
INCREASE IN THE VACCINE COMING-

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:13.182
WE GOT THROUGH THE T. P. A. AS

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:14.651
WELL AS BUILDING ON WHAT THE

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.519
LOCAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN WE HAVE

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.588
A REAL NETWORK OF THE- AND- THE

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.089
COMMUNITY CLINICS ACROSS THE

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:21.891
STATE THAT WILL BE BROUGHT IN.

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:24.761
I'M I THINK THERE ARE I'M CBO'S

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:27.630
AND THERE ARE. NONE IN SOME

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.299
JURISDICTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.333
WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.368
THINK THE AND THE LOCAL

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.836
JURISDICTIONS IN THEIR EQUITY

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:36.072
PLANS DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.607
YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE TRUSTED

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.575
SITE FOR VACCINATION AND SO I

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:41.044
THINK WITH MORE OF THESE MOBILE

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.679
CLINICS COMING ONLINE I THINK

00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.380
THAT IS A BIGGER POSSIBILITY.

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:46.015
IN TERMS OF REMEMBER THAT THE

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.017
EARLY VACCINES SUCH AS FIZER IS

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:50.353
VERY HARD TO MANAGE- GIVEN THE

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.487
COLD CHAIN REQUIREMENTS THEY'VE

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:53.256
JUST LOOSENED SOME OF THAT OUT

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.658
EVEN ON THE FIZER SIDE AND SO.

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.060
I THINK IT WILL BECOME A LITTLE

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.329
BIT EASIER WITH THE MADERA AND

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.264
NOW WITH THE CHANGE A VACCINE

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:06.169
TO ADMINISTER THEM IN. MULTIPLE

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:09.172
SITES AND LOCATIONS. I WOULD

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:12.442
JUST SAY THAT- LIVING IN ONE OF

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:14.877
THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAS BEEN.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.380
INCREDIBLY IMPACTED BY COLLUDED

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.983
WITH RESIDENTS RECEIVING BEING

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:21.851
POSITIVE WITH COLD ED DYING

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.187
FROM COLD ED NOT HAVING ASKS

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.189
ACCESS TO THE TESTING CENTERS

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.590
THE FACT THAT SEVERAL MEMBERS

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.025
OF THE LEGISLATURE MYSELF

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.360
INCLUDED HAVE CONTINUED TO

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.795
ADVOCATE FOR EQUITY. VERY EARLY

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.730
ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN THEY

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.632
CAME TO TESTING WE ALREADY KNEW

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.802
THAT. IT WAS NOT EQUITABLE. AND

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.404
THEN WHEN THE VACCINE ROLLED

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.939
OUT IT WAS EVEN MORE

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.508
HIGHLIGHTED DISPROPORTIONATE

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.510
WAY IN WHICH- THE VACCINE

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.145
ROLLOUT DID NOT WORK AND HAS

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.346
NOT WORKED FOR CERTAIN

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.315
COMMUNITIES AND- MY

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:56.419
EXPECTATION. IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.287
WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:00.289
YOU UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THE

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.892
IMPACT ON THE GROUND IN A WAY

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:06.462
THAT IS REAL PRAGMATIC. THE WAY

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.364
THAT IT IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THAT

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.366
WE WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.402
EVEN WITH THE MOBILE CLINICS-

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.971
THERE'S TIME IN EQUITY INVOLVED

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.472
I WILL I WILL I WILL TELL YOU I

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:19.375
WENT TO- A MOBILE CLINIC SITE

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:19.976
IN MY DISTRICT ANY

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.111
GOVERNMENTAL. IT WAS ONE OF THE

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.347
FAMOUS SITES FOR ONE DAY IT WAS

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.782
THERE FOR ONE DAY AND IT WAS

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.886
NOT ENOUGH. VACCINES FOR THE

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.854
COMMUNITY. AND THERE WERE A

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.122
SENIOR CITIZENS THAT WERE

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:34.657
TURNED AWAY SENIOR CITIZENS

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.759
THAT HAD TAKEN THE BUS TO GET

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.761
THERE THAT ONLY SPOKE SPANISH

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:39.729
THAT NEEDED HELP AND

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:43.099
ASSISTANCE. AND IT WAS A IT WAS

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.735
A- DEVASTATING TO SEE. THAT MY

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.336
COMMUNITY AND MY ALLEY THOSE

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.738
AND ONLY THOSE WERE NOT GETTING

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.540
THE HELP SO ONE A ONE DAY

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:53.509
MOBILE SITE. IN A COMMUNITY

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.511
LIKE BOYLE HEIGHTS IS NOT

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.847
SUFFICIENT AND SO WE NEED A

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.249
LARGER PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION. TO

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.251
ENSURE THAT. WE'RE NOT TURNING

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.420
AWAY OUR ELDERLY COMMUNITY

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:06.055
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:08.024
SIGNED UP ON MY TURN. OUR

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.393
COMMUNITIES NEED A DIFFERENT

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.828
TYPE OF CARE AND A DIFFERENT

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.763
TYPE OF AXIS THAT COMMUNITY

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.364
CLINICS CAN BE INCREDIBLY

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.100
HELPFUL WITH. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.468
PUSHING AND PUSHING AND IT'S

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.703
BEEN A LONGDELAY TO ENSURE

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.905
THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. AND

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:25.374
SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN IN A

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.343
IN A ROLL OUT PLAN. I REALLY DO

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.445
HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER OUR

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.780
OFFICES IN THE WORK IN THE

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.148
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.317
TELL YOU AND INFORM YOU WHAT IS

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.585
NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.320
BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN AT. AND

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.021
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.490
COUNTIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:41.457
THE COUNTIES HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.259
PLAN AND COMMUNITY CLINICS HAVE

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.460
A DIFFERENT PLAN AND THOSE THAT

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.161
HAVE BEEN INVITED TO

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:47.096
PARTICIPATE. AND NOT ALL OF

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.498
THEM ARE REALLY IN THE ROLLOUT

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:50.833
PLAN JUST YET AND SO I HOPE

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.034
THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.970
FRUITFUL AND PROMISING AND

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.705
THAT. WE ALL NEED TO WORK

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:57.039
TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:57.840
COMMUNITIES AND OUR MOST

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.742
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:04.013
AGAIN I WILL SAY. HAVE LANGUAGE

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.549
AXIS ISSUES. THE INTERNET

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.985
ACCESS AT LACKING OF INTERNET

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.853
ACCESS LACKING OF A SMARTPHONE

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.889
LACKING OF PERSONAL-

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.190
TRANSPORTATION AND RELY ON

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.292
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND THEN

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.027
WE TAKE THOSE ISSUES VERY

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.862
SERIOUSLY SO THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.532
ABLE TO WALK TO A TRUSTED

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:22.965
CENTER IN THEIR OWN

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.101
NEIGHBORHOOD CAN BE ABLE TO

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.236
VACCINATE EVERYONE IN THE

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:27.870
FAMILY BECAUSE THE LATINO

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.106
COMMUNITY LIVES WITHIN MULTI

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:31.941
GENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND ONE

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.376
HOUSEHOLD AND THAT'S WHY I

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:36.245
CALLED IT HAS BEEN SUCH A OF AN

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.847
IMPACT TOO MANY COMMUNITIES

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.615

LIVE IN ONE ONE HOUSEHOLD- AND

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:46.989
SO A DIFFERENT PLAN IS NEEDED

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.491
WE NEED TO REIMAGINE THE WAY

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:50.426

QUESTIONS JUST SO I UNDERSTAND

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:36.318
THE CLARIFICATION FROM THE

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:36.952
SPINELLI OR THIS COULD BE FROM

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:40.189
THE SECRETARY- IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.625
EVERY COUNTY HAS THEIR EQUITY

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:45.995
PLAN- BUT THIS IS THE COUNTY IN

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.596
CHARGE OF EXECUTING THAT EQUITY

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.533
PLAN WAR IS BLUESHIELD IN

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.402
CHARGER WHOSE. WHO'S SOME IN

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.171
CHARGE TO ENSURE THAT THAT

EQUITY PLAN GETS. EXECUTED

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.341
CIRCA THE LOCAL HEALTH

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.644
JURISDICTION IS SORT OF THE

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.045
FOCAL POINT FOR THE LOCAL

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.246
EQUITY PLAN BUT WORKING IN

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:05.915
COLLABORATION WITH THE GPA WITH

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.016
THE PROVIDERS WITH THE

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:09.452
COMMUNITY AND THE EQUITY PLANS

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.120
DO SHOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.054
WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.155
ORGANIZATIONS THEY'VE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.090
IDENTIFIED THE KEY PROVIDERS

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.659
THAT WOULD BE IN THE NETWORK SO

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.760
IT REALLY IS A ACROSS THE

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.595
BOARD. AND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.230
WORK UNLESS EVERYONE WHO HAS A

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.899
PIECE OF IT IS WORKING AND

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.668
SWIMMING IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.436
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.840
AUTHORITY TO TELL BLUESHIELD OR

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:34.777
KAISER OR CVS OR WALGREENS WHAT

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:38.447
TO DO TO THEIR- I'M SO THAT

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.515
COMES THROUGH THE TO BE A

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.649
AGREEMENT TO AND SOME OF THE

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.218
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:43.986
BEING SET UP BY THE TVA TO

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.821
ALLOW THEM TO ALLOCATE IN THE

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.123
RIGHT PLACES I'M AND SO I THINK

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.593
IT WORKS SUCH THAT ALL OF THAT

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:53.262
COMING TOGETHER AND-

TALKING ABOUT. I AM I WOULD

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.462
IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE

SOMETIME IN MAY IN APRIL- EARLY

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.633
APRIL WOULD BE OUR AIM BUT

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.134
SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.969
NUMBER OF DOSES THAT WE RECEIVE

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.938

THREE TO SIX WEEKS WITH FOR-

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:36.618
YEAH NOT AS ART. SO IT SEEMS AT

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:40.289
THAT PARTICULAR CASE WE SHOULD

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:44.493
BE ABLE TO GET- ALMOST EVERY

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.097
ADULT VACCINATED- BY THE END OF

APRIL OR DEFINITELY BY THE END

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.567
OF MAY IT LOOKS SOUNDS LIKE.

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.168
THAT'S TO ME THAT WE CAN

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.270
CONTINUE GET SUPPLY AND- CAN

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:58.373
CONTINUE TO DISTRIBUTE. RIGHT

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.109
AND I THINK THERE'D BE A LOT OF

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.543
UNKNOWNS THERE WITH THE SUPPLY

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.911

I'VE NOT THE END OF MAY BUT IT

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:14.022
WILL DEPEND BUT I THINK

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:14.656
PROBABLY THE END OF JUNE THAT'S

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.558
MORE REALISTIC. IN A NEW THING

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.260
THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK- AS

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.295
OBVIOUSLY THE- AS WE HAVE AS WE

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.064
VACCINATE MORE MORE PEOPLE THE-

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.699
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEAST

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:24.700

THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME AND

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.105
WE'RE DOING AN EDUCATION

THINGS TO TRY TO. MAKE THAT

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.810
HAPPEN BUT- YEAH THAT COULD

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.145
TAKE US A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.546
GIVEN THE SENSE WHEN CHILDREN

TALKING AT A TIME- THERE'S ONLY

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:35.304

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.778
GOING BACK TO THE TO THE HOT

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:45.647
SPOTS- I KNOW THAT THERE WAS

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:48.383
THE- DISCUSSION OF THE INCREASE

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:51.386
TO FOCUS ON CERTAIN EQUITY- ZIP

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:55.657
CODES SO IN A IN A PARTICULAR

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.025
ZIP CODE YOU KNOW HOW MANY ZIP

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:59.461
CODES FOR ROUGHLY IDENTIFIED-

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:03.232
ACROSS THE STATE. FOR SORT OF

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.299
STANDING INCREASES A

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:06.635
VACCINATION FOR AN INCREASES OF

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.604
ACCENTS. HOW MANY ARE IN THE

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.838
LOWEST QUARTILE IS THAT WHAT

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:13.108
YOU'RE ASKING. I THINK IT'S

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.910
ROUGHLY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:18.180
FIVE HUNDRED TO CODES. IN

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.082
INDIGO RAFI OF ROUGHLY THE

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:22.417
PERCENT INCREASE IN THE

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.019
VACCINES THAT THEY ALL GOT. IT

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.154
WOULD BE SO 80% IS DISTRIBUTED

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:28.957
ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE LAST

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.192
20% GOES TO THOSE ZIP CODES.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:37.799
GOT IT. I KNOW THAT- AS AS I

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.434
BAY AREA LEGISLATOR NO THERE'S

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:43.138
CONCERN ABOUT. A LACK OF- BAY

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.507
AREA ZIP CODES BEING

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:47.409
REPRESENTED I KNOW THAT WE HAD

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.745
REQUESTED THAT CERTAIN CENSUS

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.880
TRACTS GET ADDED WAS IT WAS A

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.949
REASON THAT- AND I THINK IT WAS

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:54.850
A CONCERN THAT THE ZIP CODES

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.653
WERE TOO BIG. ESPECIALLY FOR

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.755
BERRY THAT WE HAD A NUMBER OF-

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.156
POCKETS OF HOT SPOTS THAT

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.658
REALLY WEREN'T SHOWING UP ON

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:06.094
THE ZIP CODE ANALYSIS- AND SO

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.964
JUST WANTED TO ASK AGAIN WHY

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:12.100
ZIP CODES WERE CHOSEN VERSUS

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.469
CENSUS TRACKS. I'M I THINK ZIP

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.471
CODES VOTE ONE FOR BECAUSE OF

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.540
OPERAS OPERATIONALIZE ATION

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:19.341
IT'S REALLY HARD TO

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.676
OPERATIONALIZE AT THE CENSUS

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:21.977
TRACT LEVEL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:24.846
ABOUT VACCINATION- AND SO WHAT

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.682
WE TRIED TO DO WAS REALLY TO

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:28.583
PINPOINT THAT EXTRA 20% AT

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.686
LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING. TO

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.455
THOSE THAT CODES THAT ARE MOST

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.857
IMPACTED SO THESE ARE THE-

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:37.359
STATEWIDE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.995
MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.596
REALLY WANTING TO YOU SEARCH

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:43.365
AND PROVIDE YOU KNOW SOME

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.866
SATURATION TO THOSE ZIP CODES

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.669
FIRST BEFORE WE SORT OF GO BACK

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.439
TO MAYBE A AB. I'M MORE EQUAL

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:51.773
IT WAS THE AND LIKE WE'RE WE'RE

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.075
FOCUSING ON THE EQUITY PIECE OF

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.344
THIS MANY OF THESE AREAS AND

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.812
RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.113
BENEFITTED FROM THE US OR

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.849
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M IN

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.718
SOME OTHER PLACES OTHER THAN LA

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.219
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LIKE THE

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.687
FEMALE SITES TO USE SOME OF

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:06.989
THESE BIGGER EVENTS THAT ARE

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.590
HAPPENING THAT ARE BRINGING IN

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.325
EXTRA DOSES TO THE BAY AREA

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.326
THAT ARE BRINGING IN EXTRA

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:13.829
DOSES- IN SOME OTHER LOCATIONS

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:14.830
THAT WERE TRYING TO LEVEL THAT

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.798
OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND DO A TIME

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:20.002
LIMIT I THINK I AM FOCUSED ON

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.770
TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY IN THESE

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:22.904
WERE MOST IMPACTED

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:25.374
JURISDICTIONS AND- ACROSS THE

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.509
STATE. THANK YOU SUIT COULD YOU

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.510
DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT WAS SO

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:33.315
DIFFICULT ABOUT OPERATIONALIZE.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.082
IN CENSUS TRACTS. I THINK IT'S

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.417
GETTING IT SO I THINK

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.985
OPERATIONAL IT IT'S HARD TO

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.453
EVEN UP THE ZIP CODE LEVEL TO

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.322
OPERATIONALIZE TO MAKE SURE

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:42.124
THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY. I'M

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.593
GETTING THE VACCINE I THE

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:46.061
RIGHT PLACE TO DO THAT BUT ALSO

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:48.897
GET ATTRACTING PEOPLE. TO COME

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.699
TO THOSE SITES- WITHIN THOSE

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.200
JURISDICTIONS AND SO HAVING A

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.836
KNOCK ON BAXEEN AND I'M NOT FOR

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:56.738
OF A REACH THAT THEY COULD HAVE

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.806
THESE CLINICS REALLY BE

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.741
WORTHWHILE AND VACCINATE. A

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:00.742
NUMBER F PEOPLE AT THE SAME

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.611
TIME BECAUSE AGAIN WITH LIMITED

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:03.845
VACCINE WE ARE TO MAKE SURE

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:04.880
WE'RE PUTTING BACK SEEN IN

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.715
PLACES THAT I AND WE CAN USE

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.250
THAT AND GET ENOUGH PEOPLE IN

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.285
TO BE VACCINATED. OKAY THANK

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:13.021
YOU. SIR SO JUST GO BACK TO THE

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:16.358
20% BY ZIP CODE- IT WOULD YOU

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.225
KNOW IF YOU SO IF YOU WERE A

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.194
PARTICULAR ZIP CODE WHAT WHAT

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.363
PERCENT INCREASE WOULD YOU

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.932
ROUGHLY. BE ABLE TO SEE. IF YOU

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.867
WERE WILL. WALK YOU THROUGH THE

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:27.769
ALLOCATION FORMULA AND THAT

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:29.271
MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT SO.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.039
FIRST OFF WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:32.908
DO WAS ONE WE'RE FOCUSING FOR

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:34.810
THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ON THOSE

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.945
OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.547
THE THREE SECTORS THAT ARE BEEN

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.982
PRIORITIZE FOOD IN AG EDUCATION

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:43.351
AND EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SO.

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:44.319
WHAT WE DID WAS TAKE A

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.821
CALCULATION OF THE NUMBER OF

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:48.123
PEOPLE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE- IN

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.624
EACH ZIP CODE BASED ON THE

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:51.226
NUMBER OF SIXTY FIVE PLUS YEAR

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.595
OLDS. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.530
EMPLOYED BY THOSE THREE.

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.532
INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT BEN

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.501
CALCULATES A NUMBER FOR THE ZIP

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.069
CODE THE ZIP CODE IS THEN

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:01.970
GROUPED INTO ONE OF THE

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.738
QUARTILES AND THEY GOT THAT

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.507
PROPORTIONATE SHARE. OF THE

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.476
DOSES THAT HAVE 20% OF THAT I

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.811
WAS SAYS AND IN EACH OF THOSE

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:12.280
COURT TRIALS SO. THE 80% IS

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.648
ADEQUATE TO BELIEVE- EQUALLY

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.884
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS BASED ON

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.953
THOSE FACTORS NOW WE WILL AT

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:19.688
SOME POINT BE MOVED TO A BIGGER

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.690
POPULATION BASE WHICH WILL BE

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:23.425
YOU KNOW. WILL SPREAD THAT I'M

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.027
VACCINE OUT EVEN MORE- BASED ON

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.230
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN EACH I'M

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.564
JURISDICTION BUT RIGHT NOW

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.333
BECAUSE THE FOCUS WAS ON SIXTY

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:33.768
FIVE PLUS AND WHILE ON B. AND

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.737
SECTORS IT WAS TRULY BASED BY

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.472
ZIP CODE ON THOSE FORMULAS. GOT

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.741
IT SO JUST BASED ON POPULATION

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:42.377
BASED ON THAT SO. SOME SOME ZIP

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.478
CODES COULD HAVE GOT MORE

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:44.779
VACCINE JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:49.284
MORE OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:49.985
LIVING IN THERE'S A CUTS.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:53.722
CORRECT GOT A OKAY- MISTER.

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:54.656
YEAH GOOD MANAVALA QUESTION FOR

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:57.125
THAT TRIP. SO PART OF THE ISSUE

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.294
THE- THE SUPPOSED VERSUS. IS

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.829
THAT I KNOW IN MY AREA FOR

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:04.266
EXAMPLE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:04.900
FIFTY ONE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.001
WE HAVE AN UNDERCOUNT. AND WE

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.003
KNEW THAT BECAUSE THESE THESE

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:08.670
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.939
IMPACTED. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.774
THAT ARE ALSO- MAKE STATUS

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.109
HOUSEHOLD WITH A LOT OF

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:16.178
UNDOCUMENTED ESSENTIAL WORKERS

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.013
AND SO TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.114
WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.116
HAVE A SHORT. IN OUR CENSUS

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.985
COUNT IN FACT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:24.486
FIFTY ONE IN NEIGHBORING

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.221
DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN. MOST

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.790
IMPACTED BY COBIT. UP POSITIVE

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.325
CASES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:32.827
LOWEST COUNTED. REGIONS ACROSS

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.429
THE STATE SO I WOULD JUST URGE

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.898
YOU TO RECONSIDER- HELD THE

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.266
DISTRIBUTION IS BEING DONE

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.534
BECAUSE SIP CODE ALLOCATION

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.871
BASED ON POPULATION IS NOT.

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:46.374
ACTUALLY ACCURATE DATA FOR

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:47.442
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:50.011
COUNTED UP AS AS WELL AS THEY

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.913
SHOULD BE AND WE TRIED THE AS

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.415
VERY HARD AS WE COULD A MEDICAL

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.549
BED. AND COMMUNITY

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:55.850
ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALSO

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:58.119
INCREDIBLY INVOLVED- BUT THERE

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.554
IS A DISCREPANCY AND THERE

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.456
ISN'T A LARGER DISCREPANCY IN

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.025
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES- TO ED AND

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.293
MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.295
SOME GALS DISTRICT ESPECIALLY

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.330
WHEN IT COMES TO. OUR OWN

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:11.366
HOUSE- NEIGHBORS WHO DON'T HAVE

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:12.767
A HOME TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:15.503
THAT THE CENSUS COUNT AND WERE

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.239
UNDERCOUNTED IN THE OVERALL.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.640
NOT ESTIMATE SO AGAIN I WOULD

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.575
JUST URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER AND

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.711
REIMAGINE THAT THE NUMBERS THAT

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.112
YOU MAY SEE ON PAPER ARE NOT

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:28.083
ACTUALLY REFLECTIVE. OF WHAT'S

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:31.119
GOING ON ON THE GROUND. IN THE

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:33.521
EMPLOYMENT SECTORS WE DID USE

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.991
EMPLOYMENT DATA SO THAT HELPS

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.292
TO GET OUT SOME OF THOSE

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:38.360
POPULATIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.395
ABOUT THAT MAY BE- UNDERCOUNTED

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.963

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:37.245
HOW WE MIGHT ACCOMPLISH THAT

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.680
BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP. TO THE

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.749
WHOLE POPULATION. I'M AND SO

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.250
MORE TO COME ON THAT WE ARE

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.586
SERIOUSLY TAKING. YEAH LOOKING

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:45.987
AT THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT IF

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.622
WE CAN SATURATE THOSE

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.690
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE KNOW WE

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.425
HAVE THE BIGGEST. IMPACT OF

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.127
COVENT. THEN THAT WILL HELP US

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.028
ALL AND HELP THOSE. THOSE THAT

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:57.465
ARE. MOST I'M AT RISK OF SEVERE

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.734
DISEASE- AND THEN THE LAST

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.269
THING I WILL SAY FROM TALKING

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:03.338
ABOUT CENSUS TRACTS AND- US

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:04.739
THAT BECAUSE PRICES ARE JUST

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.307
YOU KNOW HOW WE TRY TO MAKE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:06.775
SURE THAT WE ARE BEING

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.744
EQUITABLE. ACROSS THE STATE ARE

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.045
OUT THERE AND I THINK THERE'S

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:12.046
THAT'S THAT THAT WE'RE ALL

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:13.114
GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:13.848
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE

01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:15.250
GOT ELECTED TO AYE BUT THEN

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:16.017
THERE'S A SPACE AND HOW DO I%

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.719
MAKE SURE I'M STILL BEING FAIR

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:18.787
AND EQUITABLE TO THE REST OF

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.989
THE STATE OUT THERE. I THINK WE

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:21.823
NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.691
BECOMING TOO NARROW I IT'S IN

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:25.293
MY EXPERIENCE NOT EVEN WHEN I

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.828
HAVE THE ZIP CODE AND GET THE

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.096
CITY OF CONTENT COMPLETELY

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:29.364
CONTAIN WHAT THE ZIP CODE.

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.266
OFTENTIMES IT'S COMMUNITIES OF

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:32.267
INTEREST AND IT'S BIGGER THAN

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.135
THAT AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.037
AND SO. I THIK WE NEED TO BE

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.906
CAREFUL AS WE TRY TO IMPROVE ON

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.108
OUR METRICS I'M NOT. SAYING

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:41.409
THAT IT'S PERFECT AND THERE'S

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.944
SPACE FOR IMPROVEMENTS BUT I

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:43.912
THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:44.946
THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING UP THE

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.347
SITUATION TO FILL OR THAT WE

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:47.615
HAVE. A LOT OF OTHER

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:49.350
INDIVIDUALS- THAT ARE NOT FROM

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.385
COMMUNITIES COMING INTO TAKES

01:24:50.452 --> 01:24:51.486
LOTS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.488
TIME. TO GET OUT THERE OR WILL

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.789

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.691
IT UP WE CAN SIGN UP. ON IN

UNTIL WE CAN SIGN UP FAMILIES

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:58.793
IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.661
THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRUST

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:00.995
ISSUE. BUT IF I HAVE A FAMILY

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:02.497
COMING INTO A HUSBAND AND A

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.498
WIFE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:04.432

THE MORE TRUSTED THAN THEIR

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.553
HEALTH PLANS. I THINK IT'S

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.555
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE WORKING

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.991
THEY THEY NOT ONLY ARE CLINICS

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:52.493

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.461
WHO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.496
BECAUSE THEY CONSTANTLY HAVE TO

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:57.365
DO OUTREACH SO IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:58.332
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

HAVE NOT REACHED AFTER IS JUST

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.144
IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT-

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:11.212
DIFFERENT LEVEL AND IT'S A

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:12.980
DIFFERENT TYPE OF CLIENTELE AND

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.015
SO I THINK IT IS REALLY

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:17.452
IMPORTANT FOR YOU ALL TO. ON

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.619

OF ACTUAL PLANNING AND HOW IT'S

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:49.410
HOW IT SHOULD WORK SO THAT WE

WE'RE TARGETING FOLKS ARE ARE

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.308

THOUSAND SLOTS ON AND IN THIS.

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:27.975
UNITIES THAT ARE STILL IMPACTED

THAT LONG PROCESS- IN IN WE HAD

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:39.820
ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE WORKING ON

THE SITES AND THAT THE SLOTS

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.695

INTERNET AND WE ENDED UP WITH A

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:50.898
SITUATION LIKE YOU HEARD IN

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:52.432

THE WEEK PRIOR WE HAD A

01:42:58.872 --> 01:42:59.740
DIFFERENT SYSTEM WHERE WE

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.208
DIDN'T HAVE THE FACT THIS QUOTE

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.243

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.719
TILL THEY WERE THERE ON SITE.

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:14.021

TROUBLESHOOTING- BUT IT WAS OUR

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.094
ABILITY TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND

AN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS

COMPASSION IT TAKES

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:20.207
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANGUAGE

COUNTY. I THINK THAT PART

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:10.377

01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:17.851

THERE DIFFERENT EMERGENCY-

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:06.579
SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT THE

EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WHICH

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:13.385
WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION

THIS. CHANGE THAT RECKONED IS

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:25.731
THE ONE TO ESTADO AT THE

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:27.933
BEGINNING OF THE AND THEN MOUNT-

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.935
IN THE- THIS WOULD GIVE THE

LEDGER. THE ABILITY TO HAVE IN

02:03:31.637 --> 02:03:33.005
AND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND

THEY'LL FOR SPENDING I WOULD

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:37.243
HOME. THE CHANCE THAT EMERGENCY

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:38.844
SPENDING ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:40.746
THE STATE BUDGET STRUCTURE OR

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:42.815
CONDITION. WE'RE ALSO

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.450
RECOMMENDING THAT THE

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.352
LEGISLATURE ON REQUIRE THE

02:03:46.418 --> 02:03:47.586

ADVANCE NOTIFICATION WHEN IT

02:03:49.922 --> 02:03:52.925
WANTS TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.727
INTO A THREE HOUR. SO IN SOME

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:56.729
YEARS B. ADMINISTRATION MIGHT

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:58.097
NEED TO SPEND MORE ON

02:03:58.164 --> 02:03:59.799
EMERGENCIES THAN WAS BUDGETED

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:00.933
WITH ANDREA AT THE BEGINNING OF

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.102
THE YEAR AND SO TO ENSURE THAT

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.603
THE LEGISLATURE IS PART OF THIS

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.672
DECISION. WE'D RECOMMEND

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:07.673
REQUIRING THAT THE

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.575
ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE ADVANCE

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:12.344
NOTIFICATION FOR JAIL BC THIS

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:14.446
ADVANCE NOTIFICATION COULD BE

02:04:14.513 --> 02:04:15.781
STRUCTURE BASED ON VARIOUS

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.650
FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:19.585
LEGISLATURE CURRENT. ESTABLISH

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:21.887
SHORTER NOTIFICATION PERIODS OR

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:24.490
SMALLER TRANSFERS THAT ARE TIED

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:26.258
TO ONGOING EMERGENCIES FOR

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.961
EXAMPLE- REQUIRING SEVENTY TWO

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:30.262
HOUR NOTIFICATION WE THINK A

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:32.998
SHORTER NOTIFICATION PERIOD-

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:34.867
FOR THIS TYPE OF TRANSFER OF

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:36.602
THE APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THE

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:37.903
AMOUNT BEING TRANSFERRED WITH

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.405
THE SMALL EMERGENCY WOULD BE

02:04:39.471 --> 02:04:40.940
AREN'T GOING AND THEREFORE THEY

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:42.741
EXPENDITURE LIKELY MORE

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:44.810
PRESSING NEED. AND IT WOULD BE

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:46.545
ACCOMPANIED BY SUFFICIENT

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.546
DETAILS TO ALLOW THE

02:04:47.613 --> 02:04:54.086
LEGISLATURE. TO- DO AN

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:57.890
EXPEDITED REVIEW. THE PROPOSAL.

02:04:57.957 --> 02:04:59.258
FOR HOWEVER FOR LONG LARGER

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:01.393
TRAIN WE RECOMMEND REQUIRE A

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.762
LONGER TIMES A IS VERY OR FORTY

02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:06.065
DAYS- THIS WOULD BE- PUTTING

02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:08.634
PLACE TO ALLOW THE LARGEST-

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:10.202
GREATER TRYING TO CONSIDER IT

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.871
AND I TO DO OVERSIGHT

02:05:11.937 --> 02:05:14.773
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS- BRINGING

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.775
TOGETHER AN OVERSIGHT HEARING

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:20.679
TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT. THE

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:21.413
TRANSFER IS APPROPRIATE.

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:21.981
HOWEVER WE CONTINUE WE WOULD

02:05:22.047 --> 02:05:24.316
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.352
PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATION THE

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.320
ABILITY TO WAIVE THE

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:30.422
NOTIFICATION- REQUIREMENT AND

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:33.225
URGENT SIR THE CIRCUMSTANCES-

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:35.127
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IT WOULD

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:36.829
BE UP TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:37.897
BUDGET COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:39.765
WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THE

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.300
WAY BURKE AND ONCE THE WAIVER

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:43.569
WAS APPROVED THE- EMERGENCY

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:44.970
TRANSFER INDUSTRY A LOT COULD

02:05:45.037 --> 02:05:47.072
TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY. OR UPON

02:05:47.139 --> 02:05:49.441
WHATEVER SHORTER TIME THE JAIL

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:52.378
B. C. APPROVED. WE ARE

02:05:52.444 --> 02:05:54.713
RECOMMEND REQUIRING MORE

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.216
REPORTING ON EMERGENCY-

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:59.551
SPENDING AND ALLOCATIONS FROM

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:02.054
REAL HARM I DO WANT TO NOTE

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:04.156
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.091
PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WITH

02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:07.393
INFORMATION ON EMERGENCY

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:08.961
STANDING AND IN FACT MORE

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:10.796
INFORMATION THAN IS CURRENTLY

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:13.465
REQUIRED BY STATUTE. DESPITE

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.734
THIS FACT DESPITE THE FACT THAT

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:16.769
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.704
GONE ABOVE THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:20.706
STATUTE WE STILL THINK THAT THE

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.007
LEGISLATURE NEEDS MORE

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:24.209
INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:26.045
EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT OVERSIGHT.

02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:27.346
ON PASSAGE WHAT WE'RE

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.881
RECOMMENDING IS THAT THE

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:30.482
LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:32.618
ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY IT

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:35.487
WHEN. ALLOCATIONS FROM DARIO

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:38.157
ARE BEING MADE TO DEPARTMENTS-

02:06:38.223 --> 02:06:39.491
THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:40.759
TIME OF THE ALLOCATION IS

02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:43.629
TAKING PLACE. AND THE

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:45.297
NOTIFICATION WOULD INCLUDE

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:47.399
DETAILED INFORMATION ON HOW THE

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:48.233
FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA BE

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:51.003
YEARS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:52.571
THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE MONTHLY

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:55.607
REPORTS ON EMERGENCY SPENDING.

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.042
THIS WOULD BE AN ONGOING

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:58.210
REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.446
WOULD APPLY TO ALL EMERGENCIES

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:02.014
AND THE MONTHLY REPORT WOULD

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:04.016
INCLUDE ALL PLANNED AN ACTUAL

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:06.385
EMERGENCY SPENDING BY STATE AT.

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:08.554
LEAST INCLUDING EXPENDITURES OF

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:10.289

ARE GOING TO BE IS ARM. SO THE

02:07:28.907 --> 02:07:31.577
LEGISLATURE WORK TO IMPLEMENT

02:07:31.643 --> 02:07:34.646
THE REFORMS I OUTLINED ABOVE WE

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:36.148
THINK THAT IT COULD BE

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:45.524
APPROPRIATE TO APPROVED.

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:47.860
CONTROLS ELEVEN POINT ZERO THE

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:50.295
ADMIN. TO YEARS ALL THE RULE. I

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:51.797
JUST THIS- THROUGH THE BUDGET

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.199
YEAR PROGRAM NINETEEN HOWEVER

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:56.101
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT- YOU

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.236
GREATER CAN OVER THE LEVEL OF

02:07:57.302 --> 02:08:00.305
NAY IT'S- IN ITS- WHAT. COULD

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:02.274
BRIDGE CONTROL SUCH ELEVEN NINE

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:03.709
TWO AND CREATE A BUDGET CONTROL

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:06.078

NOW EXTENDED IN THE BUDGET. AND

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:18.123
IN ACROSS TO REQUIRE THE LEAD

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:19.758
BEING. BEFORE MONEY IS ALEC

02:08:19.825 --> 02:08:22.227
FROM CONTROLS TO THE PARTNER.

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:23.829
WE WILL THAT THE AMOUNT SPENT

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.731
ON WHO NINETEEN IN THIS CASE

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:29.134
COULD ONLY BE INCREASED WITH AN

02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:30.736
AMENDMENT TO THE BUDGET ACT. SO

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:32.538
AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY TO

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:33.839
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:35.307
RECOMMENDATIONS OR OTHER

02:08:35.374 --> 02:08:43.148
QUESTIONS LEGISLATURE. GREAT

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:45.884
THANK YOU- MISS MISTER

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:48.821
SODERBERG JUST- SO FISHY YOUR

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:49.421
LAST COMMENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T

02:08:49.488 --> 02:08:54.226
SEE THAT IN THERE- BECAUSE WE

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:57.496
WHICH I THINK RIO ON- IS AN

02:08:57.563 --> 02:09:00.232
EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EMERGENCIES

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:00.966
BUT I DON'T THINK WE EVER

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:03.035
ANTICIPATED AN EMERGENCY THAT

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:05.471
WAS GOING TO TOUCH EVERY FACET

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:08.707
OF THE STATE AND- COULD BE IT

02:09:08.774 --> 02:09:10.142
COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:12.111
FRANKLY ANY EXPENDITURE IN THE

02:09:12.177 --> 02:09:15.714
STATE BUDGET- FOR WELL OVER A

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:20.519
YEAR NOW. SO ON. BASED ON THAT

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:23.255
CONCERN I THINK WHAT WOULD YOU

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:26.525
DID YOU DID YOU LOOK AT-

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:29.128
ACTUALLY. DOING A REGULAR

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:31.663
SUNSET OF DRILL LAW SAYING

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.999
INSTEAD OF PRE AUTHORIZING IT

02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:35.601
FOR JUNE JUST MAYBE AUTHORIZING

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:37.436
A FOR EVERY THREE MONTHS OR

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:40.339
MORE SO SPECIFIC PERIOD- ORDER

02:09:40.405 --> 02:09:42.708
OR DID YOU. PREFER YOUR

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.243
RECOMMENDATION AROUND BUDGET

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:45.878
CONTROL SECTION VERSUS

02:09:45.944 --> 02:09:47.779
SOMETHING THAT WOULD NATURALLY

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:49.781
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO RE

02:09:49.848 --> 02:09:56.121
AUTHORIZE- THE- CONTROL. FORTY

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:59.925
IT. WOULD ON THAT WOULD HAVE BE

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:01.260
AN OPTION AVAILABLE TO THE

02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:02.394
LEGISLATURE IN OUR

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:04.396
RECOMMENDATION WE ENVISIONED

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:07.266
APPROVING OUR CONTROL SECTION

02:10:07.332 --> 02:10:08.700
ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO WHICH

02:10:08.767 --> 02:10:09.268
WOULD AUTHORIZE IT FOR THE

02:10:09.334 --> 02:10:11.670
ENTIRE BUDGET YEAR BUT THERE'S

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:12.738
NO REASON THAT TH LEGISLATURE

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:15.407
COULDN'T MODIFY THAT AND

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:17.075
AUTHORIZE IT FOR A SHORTER

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:18.143
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S

02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:19.511
ABSOLUTELY AN OPTION THAT WOULD

02:10:19.578 --> 02:10:21.813
BE AVAILABLE. IS THERE ARE PROS

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:22.948
AND CONS TO DOING OF WHAT WERE

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:24.049
THE OTHER FROM AND WHAT WHAT'S

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:27.786
WHAT'S THAT WE WOULD BE THE PRO

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:28.353
GOING FOR THE BUDGET CONTROL

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:32.491
SECTION. THE PRO OF- IT ON A

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:34.493
SHORTER TIME. IT ABOUT WOULD.

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.827
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:39.932
NATURAL POINTS AWAY IN. ON THE-

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.767
THE POTENTIAL CON OF THAT WOULD

02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:44.303
BE IF THE SECTION EXPIRED AT

02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:45.637
ANY POINT IN TIME WHERE IS

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.306
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:47.372 --> 02:10:50.709
TO ACT ON IT- IT COULD DELAY

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:52.311
THE ABILITY OF THE FUNDS TO BE

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:53.812
AVAILABLE. BUT THIS IS

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:54.846
SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY THAT THE

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:56.281
LEGISLATURE WOULD KNOW IN

02:10:56.348 --> 02:10:58.750
ADVANCE AND SO ARE THE

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.252
LEGISLATURE COULD PLANT PLAN

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:01.853
AROUND THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU'D

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.022
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE-

02:11:04.089 --> 02:11:07.059
AUTHORITY TO- USE TRIO IT

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:08.060
DIDN'T EXPIRE WHILE THE

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:09.428
LEGISLATURE WAS SAY OUT OF

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:11.263
SESSION AND- MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:12.331
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RE

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:13.899
AUTHORIZE IT. BUT THERE COULD

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:18.403
BE WAYS. TO WORK OR TO WORK

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.805
AROUND THAT. WE'LL SEE FOR THE

02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:22.140
DID THE YEAR WE KNOW WE AND SO-

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:24.876
SEPTEMBER. SO WE COULD. HOW

02:11:24.943 --> 02:11:25.677
AUTHORS IN THE BUDGET GOING TO

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:27.346
HEALTH FIFTEENTH. AND THEN

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:29.314
SEEING WHAT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:32.417
AFTER THAT. THAT WOULD

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:34.253
ABSOLUTELY- THAT THAT

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:37.055
ABSOLUTELY. THAT COULD NOT WORK

02:11:37.122 --> 02:11:39.024
WELL FOR THE LEGISLATURE GREAT

02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:42.828
GO GO BACK TO MISTER BENSON-

02:11:42.894 --> 02:11:44.563
COULD COULD YOU- LET US KNOW

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:48.934
WHY YOU CHOSE JUNE THIRTIETH

02:11:49.001 --> 02:11:49.534
TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CONTROL

02:11:49.601 --> 02:11:50.602
SECTION ELEVEN DOT NINE TWO. I

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.471
DO ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE STILL

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:53.872
GOING TO BE IN A STATE OF

02:11:53.939 --> 02:11:57.109
EMERGENCY THE POINT. I THINK

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:58.543
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THERE IS

02:11:58.610 --> 02:11:59.611
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS A

02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:01.947
REAL FIRM GRASP ON WINDY

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:03.849
EMERGENCY WILL AND CERTAINLY

02:12:03.915 --> 02:12:06.218
BACK WHEN DECEMBER. DECEMBER

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:07.419
WHEN THE BUDGET WAS BEING PUT

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:08.587
TOGETHER IN PROPOSED THERE WAS

02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:10.489
EVEN LESS INFORMATION AVAILABLE

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:12.491
TO TRY AND MAKE. AN EDUCATED

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:14.526
ESTIMATE ON THAT SO OUR THOUGHT

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:15.827
WAS TO EXTEND IT THROUGH THE

02:12:15.894 --> 02:12:17.129
BUDGET YEAR I THINK WE'RE

02:12:17.195 --> 02:12:18.463
CERTAINLY OPEN TO AND

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:20.332
RECOGNIZING THAT OUR PROPOSALS

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:21.867
HAVE A STARTING POINT WE'RE

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:22.467
GOING TO BE GIVING UPDATES IN

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:23.902
THE REVISION. WILL HAVE

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:25.270
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BEST

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:27.806
WAY TO HANDLE THAT I THINK OUR

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.709
PRIMARY CONCERN. CONCOURSE IS

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.277
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:34.012
ABILITY TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:34.946
IN THE IN THE SPECIFIC

02:12:35.013 --> 02:12:36.581
SITUATIONS WHERE IMMEDIATE

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.350
RESPONSE IS NECESSARY I THINK.

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:40.352
WHAT WE WHAT YOU KNOW I HOPE

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:43.155
FOLKS RECOGNIZING IS THAT WHEN

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:44.990
WE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:49.061
ISSUES LIKE. THE RECENT- RE

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.829
OPENINGS SAFE YOU KNOW WE THAT

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:52.097
WAS DONE THROUGH EARLY ACTION

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:53.031
AS OPPOSED TO JUST SOMETHING

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:53.932
DOWN THREE THREE OH SO WHEN

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:54.700
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO DO

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:55.600
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO GET

02:12:55.667 --> 02:12:57.102
DONE QUICKLY. BUT DOESN'T

CONCERNS REGARDING THE- LACK OF

02:13:54.259 --> 02:13:59.664
DETAILS AS WELL AS THE LACK OF

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:00.298
LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION IN THE

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:02.100
PROPOSAL. INFRASPECIFIC THE

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:03.802
LACK OF DETAILS WHERE THERE IS

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:06.138
THIS YOUR FIRST IT DIFFICULT

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:06.671
PREPARATIONS TO A LOT OF

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:10.308
DEPARTMENTS- ISN'T NOT NOT VERY

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:12.444
MUCH DETAIL FRANKLY VERY LITTLE

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:14.212
RESTRICTION. AND THEN I GUESS

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:17.516
THERE WERE- BUCKETS OF. MONEY

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:20.318
OR LABRADOR THERE WERE BUCKETS

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:21.586
OF MONEY GOING TO CERTAIN

02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:24.523
DEPARTMENTS THAT THE L. A. O.

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:27.225
NOTICED THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:28.326
SPECIFIC ROLE FOR THOSE

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:30.529
DEPARTMENTS IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT.

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:34.065
WHAT THE FUNDING WAS FOR. YES I

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.767
THINK WHAT- MISTER SORT BURKE

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:37.669
WAS REFERRING TO IS IN CONTROL

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.871
SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:41.206
THERE ARE THREE DEPARTMENTS

02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:43.175
LISTED ON OUR LIST OF

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.609
DEPARTMENTS WERE FUNDING COULD

02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:46.912
BE TRANSFERRED INTO THAT DO NOT

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:49.281
HAVE A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:50.782
PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET SO THAT

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.117
IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE A POT

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:53.685
OF MONEY AND WE HAVEN'T IN FIVE

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:56.054
WORDS FOR. ITS THAT THERE IS NO

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:57.155
PART OF MONEY AND SO I THINK

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:58.924
WHAT MR SERVERS TRYING TO

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:00.759
REFERENCES THAT SAY WE NEED TO

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:03.628
TRANSFER MONEY FROM CDPH TWO OH

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:07.933
YES- HIS BIGGEST POINT WAS

02:15:07.999 --> 02:15:10.068
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PROPOSED

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:12.904
EXPENDITURE- PRO YES SO WHAT

02:15:12.971 --> 02:15:14.606
THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT ON

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:16.141
WHEN IT'S TRANSFERRED OVER YES

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:17.409
IS WHERE HE FELT IT WAS

02:15:17.476 --> 02:15:19.344
UNCERTAINTY. OUR PERSPECTIVE IS

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:21.046
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:23.548
BUDGET PROPOSAL THE ACTIVITIES

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:24.850
THAT EACH OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:25.984
WILL BE USING THE FUNDING FOR

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:29.588
SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU D. G. S.

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:30.755
THEIR THEIR AMOUNT THAT'S IN

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:32.257
THE PROPOSAL TALKS ABOUT

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:35.594
SPECIFIC HOTELLING PROGRAMS

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:36.228
LIKE THE HOTEL STRUCTURE WORKER

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:38.129
PROGRAM. IF FOR SOME REASON WE

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:39.631
NEED TO TRANSFER MONEY BACK IN

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:40.832
BETTER PREPARATION TO DIFFERENT

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:42.000
APARTMENT IT WILL BE BECAUSE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:43.502
THEY'RE DOING THE SAME ACTIVITY

02:15:43.568 --> 02:15:45.103
BUT THE EXPENDITURE NEEDS TO

02:15:45.170 --> 02:15:45.804
GET MADE BY A DIFFERENT

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:48.139
DEPARTMENT SAME WOULD APPLY FOR

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.374
WHEN I WAS A C. P. H. THEIR

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:51.610
SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF PROPOSED

02:15:51.676 --> 02:15:53.512
FOR CITY PH THAT ARE RELATED TO

02:15:53.578 --> 02:15:55.947
STAFFING. WORK SEARCH AND GO AS

02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:57.649
WE UPDATE LIKELY IT WILL

02:15:57.716 --> 02:15:58.617
INCLUDE STAFFING FOR

02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:01.186
VACCINATION VACCINATION SITES

02:16:01.253 --> 02:16:02.954
IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE MONEY.

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:04.789
PROGRADE FOR THAT DEPARTMENT IT

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:05.891
WOULD BE TO DO THE SAME

02:16:05.957 --> 02:16:07.759
ACTIVITY BUT IN RECOGNITION

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:14.799
THAT A DIFFERENT APARTMENT. IS

02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:15.267
GOING TO BE MAKING THE

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:15.867
EXPENDITURE SO. YOU WOULD KNOW

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:16.501
WHAT IS TO BE SPENT ON BECAUSE

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.069
WE WOULD STILL. ON SAME ACTIVE.

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:19.237
IT JUST IT DIRECT.THAT IT

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:23.508
BACKS. MAY NEED BE MADE BY INTO.

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:27.245
THAT DOES NOT WORK ON. I'M I

02:16:27.312 --> 02:16:28.146
THINK I THINK IT HAS A THINK

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:32.384
THERE STILL- THE LACK OF DETAIL

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.853
REGARDING THE ONE POINT FOUR

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.257
LEARN- JOINT DOLLAR EXPENDITURE

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:40.892
I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO.

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:42.527
PROVED THAT KIND OF

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:46.531
APPROPRIATION- GOING INTO A

02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:49.768
YEAR WHERE WE HOPE THAT WE WILL

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:53.805
BE. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE BEEN DOWN

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:55.874
A PANDEMIC OR YOU KNOW COMING

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:59.177
OUT OF THE PANDEMIC SO ON. I

02:16:59.244 --> 02:16:59.811
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE

02:16:59.878 --> 02:17:02.581
MORE DISCUSSION YOU KNOW IN MAY

02:17:02.647 --> 02:17:03.949
REGARDING THAT FINAL NUMBER I

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:05.850
THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED MORE

02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:09.955
SPECIFIC DETAIL. AND- I DON'T

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.623
THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:12.357
SUPPORTED AT LEAST IN THIS

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:14.459
COMMITTEE- ON THE JUNE

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:16.528
THIRTIETH THE DATE IN SELL

02:17:16.595 --> 02:17:19.064
EITHER- I THINK I WOULD URGE

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:21.166
THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A

02:17:21.232 --> 02:17:24.302
LOOK AT EITHER- A SHORTER TIME

02:17:24.369 --> 02:17:26.371
FRAME. WHERE THE AVAILABILITY

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:28.473
TO RENEW OR MOVING TOWARDS WHAT

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:30.575
THE L. L. SUGGEST TO WHICH IS

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:31.910
MORE OF A BUNCH OF CONTROL

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:36.147
SECTION. ROSS SO ANY OTHER PLEA

02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:40.585

WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:41.005
TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME COICES.

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:41.606
ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE FEDERAL

FUNDING. SECOND I'M GONNA

02:19:43.808 --> 02:19:46.177

ABOUT THE ROUGHLY TWENTY SIX

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:24.249
BILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL

02:20:24.315 --> 02:20:25.784
RELIEF FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:27.285
AS PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:29.287
PLAN OR OR ALSO KNOWN AS A. R.

02:20:29.354 --> 02:20:33.491
P. THIS MONEY IS. RELATIVELY

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:34.959
DISCRETIONARY THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:36.761
DOESHAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.696
HOW IT CAN BE USED BUT THERE

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.832
ARE KIND OF FOUR BUCKETS- THAT

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:43.001
THE FUNDS HAVE TO FALL INTO SO

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:44.235
THE FIRST IS THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:20:44.302 --> 02:20:46.437
BE USED FOR- CORONAVIRUS

02:20:46.504 --> 02:20:47.872
RESPONSE EITHER YOU KNOW

DIRECTLY LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:51.042
EMERGENCY RELATED STUFF OR-

02:20:51.109 --> 02:20:53.077
INDIRECTLY- SUCH AS RESPONDING

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.579
TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF KOBE

02:20:54.646 --> 02:20:56.381
NINETEEN. THE SECOND IS THAT

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:57.882
THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO

02:20:57.949 --> 02:21:00.185
BACKFILL REVENUE LOSSES AND

02:21:00.251 --> 02:21:01.519
THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:03.121
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC.

02:21:03.188 --> 02:21:04.722
THIRD OF THE FUNDS CAN BE USED

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:06.157
TO SUPPORT ESSENTIAL WORK AND

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:08.159
FOR THE FUNDS CAN BE USED- FOR

02:21:08.226 --> 02:21:11.596
UTILITY TYPE EXPENDITURES TO-

02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:13.264
FOR WATER SEWER AND BROADBAND

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:16.367
THOSE KINDS OF UPGRADES- THERE

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:18.670
ARE TWO NOTABLE RESTRICTIONS ON

02:21:18.736 --> 02:21:21.306
THE USE OF FUNDS. FIRST OF ALL-

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:22.407
IF THE STATE ACCEPTS THE FUNDS

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:23.641
THAT ESSENTIALLY AGREES NOT TO

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:27.145
USE THEM TO REDUCE TAXES AND-

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:28.213
WE'RE STILL WAITING ACTUALLY

02:21:28.279 --> 02:21:29.314
FOR SOME TREASURY GUIDANCE

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:32.050
AROUND THERE- KIND OF EXACTLY

02:21:32.116 --> 02:21:32.951
WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT THE

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:34.819
DIFFERENT- RESTRICTIONS WILL BE

02:21:34.886 --> 02:21:36.721
THERE SO RIGHT NOW WE KIND OF

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:37.789
ONLY HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:39.057
WHAT THIS RESTRICTION IS BUT

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:39.991
ONCE WE HAVE MORE TO MORE

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:40.692
GUIDANCE FROM THE U. S.

02:21:40.758 --> 02:21:42.260
TREASURY WILL. WELL NO MORE

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:43.962
AND- THE SECOND RESTRICTION IS

02:21:44.028 --> 02:21:44.996
THAT THEY CANNOT BE USED THE

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:49.267
FUNDS. CANNOT BE USED FOR

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:49.901
SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS.

02:21:49.968 --> 02:21:50.535
THERE GOING TO BE A BILL UNTIL

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:51.803
THE- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THEY

02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:53.271
DON'T HAVE TO BE SPENT IN THIS

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:54.339
BUDGET YEAR EVEN NEXT BUDGET

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:56.241
YEAR- THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

02:21:56.307 --> 02:21:57.175
AVAILABLE OVER THAT MULTI OR

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:58.776
PER. I'M NOT YEAR PERIOD TO THE

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:01.179
LEGISLATURE HAS ACTUALLY A GOOD

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:03.615
AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY THERE-

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.283
SECOND IN FISCAL RELIEF TO THE

02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:07.485
STATE. THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.386
BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS THAT

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:09.787
ARE GOING TO GO DIRECTLY FROM

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:10.588
THE FEDERAL GVERNMENT TO LOCAL

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:12.590
GOVERNMENTS. ALL COUNTIES AND

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:14.893
CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:15.460
FIFTY THOUSAND WILL RECEIVE

02:22:15.527 --> 02:22:16.594
THEIR FUNDS DIRECTLY FROM THE

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.062
FUNDS. AND THAT AND THOSE

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:19.530
CITIES WITH POPULATIONS LESS

02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:20.865
THAN FIFTY THOUSAND WILL GET

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:22.166
THEIR ALLOCATIONS INDIRECTLY TO

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:23.001
THE STATE WILL GET THE MONEY

02:22:23.067 --> 02:22:24.269
FIRST AND THEN IT'LL DISTRIBUTE

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:26.571
THOSE FUNDS TO THE CITY'S- BUT

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:27.605
THE LEGISLATURE WON'T HAVE

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:29.173
DISCRETION THERE THE FUNDS WILL

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:30.408
HAVE TO BE ALLOCATED ACCORDING

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:32.110
TO A FORMULA PROVIDED BY THE

02:22:32.176 --> 02:22:34.946
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THEN THE

02:22:35.013 --> 02:22:36.848
SECOND CATEGORY IS RELATED TO

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:39.751
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- B. A.

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:42.053
R. P. PROVIDED ABOUT. THESE ARE

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:43.488
ESTIMATES- SO THAT THESE

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:44.489
NUMBERS ARE STILL SUBJECT TO

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:45.657
CHANGE BUT ABOUT TWO POINT TWO

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:47.592
BILLION. FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.127
WHICH IS SORT OF A CONTINUATION

02:22:49.193 --> 02:22:50.428
OF THE FUNDS. THAT WERE

02:22:50.495 --> 02:22:51.863
PROVIDED IN DECEMBER THAT THE

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:53.097
LEGISLATURE ALREADY ALLOCATED

02:22:53.164 --> 02:22:54.899
IN EARLY ACTION AND THEN ABOUT

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:56.367
A BILLION DOLLARS IN HOMEOWNERS

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:58.536
ASSISTANCE- BUT WHICH ARE FUNDS

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:00.805
THAT WOULD. GO TO QUALIFYING

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.473
HOMEOWNERS AREN'T TO HELP OF

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:03.574

PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS AT THAT

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:07.211
TRACK. SO THOSE MONIES- THE

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:08.746
LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE A PRETTY

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:10.248
SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN IN

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:11.783
DETERMINING HOW THEY'RE- HOW

02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:13.284
THEY'RE ALLOCATED. AND THEN

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:14.819
FINALLY THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:15.753
AND FIFTY MILLION FOR CAPITAL

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.522
PROJECTS. THOSE SORT OF

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:20.525
SUPPORTING THE INDIRECT EFFECTS

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:22.694
OF THE PANDEMIC- SO. DO REMOTE

WORK SCHOOL AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.365
AND SO AN EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE

02:23:27.432 --> 02:23:29.033
WOULD BE LIKE USING THE MONEY

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:32.270
FOR BROADBAND- AND OTHER

02:23:32.337 --> 02:23:34.639
SIMILAR PROCESS. FROM SO

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.274
TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE ON

02:23:36.341 --> 02:23:37.942
MAJOR SYSTEMS CATEGORIES FOR

LARGEST FUNDING AMOUNTS THAT-

02:23:44.582 --> 02:23:46.351

DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:24.936
DEPARTMENT FINANCER OR WHAT THE

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:26.571
L. A. L. L. I WANT TO DELVE

02:27:26.637 --> 02:27:28.206
DEEPER INTO THIS THE GUIDANCE

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:29.974
IN TERMS OF THE USE FOR- SMALL

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:31.976
BUSINESS RELIEF- CERTAINLY AS A

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:33.177
LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'VE BEEN

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:34.478
GRAPPLING WITH TRYING TO GET

02:27:34.545 --> 02:27:39.517
PPP CONFORMITY- DONE- IT WAS

02:27:39.584 --> 02:27:41.352
KIND OF ON TRACK AND THEN IT

02:27:41.419 --> 02:27:43.020
WILL. IN AND NOW IT'S NOT HEY

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:43.888
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:46.290
CLARITY- CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE

02:27:46.357 --> 02:27:47.925
ME A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICS IN

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:49.126
TERMS OF WHAT THE PACIFIC

02:27:49.193 --> 02:27:51.896
SPECIFIC ISSUE IS THAT THAT THE

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:55.099
STATE HAS THE USE STATE FUNDS

02:27:55.166 --> 02:27:56.234
AND THEN I CAN'T USE THE

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:58.102
FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING

02:27:58.169 --> 02:28:00.471
TO THE STATE TO DO THAT- AS YOU

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:02.306
CAN. AS YOU PROBABLY ALREADY

02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:03.474
KNOW YOU ALREADY KNOW THE

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.709
DEADLINE JUST RECENTLY PASSED

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:07.411
THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY- YEAH

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:08.679
WE WERE TRYING TO GET THIS

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:10.314
COMPLETED BEFORE THAT THE

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:12.516
FILING DEADLINE SO CAN YOU HE

02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:17.021
SAID SOME LIGHT AND SO. THAT

02:28:17.088 --> 02:28:17.555
THE THINKING AT WITHIN THE

02:28:17.622 --> 02:28:18.256
ADMINISTRATION. SURE CHRIS

02:28:18.322 --> 02:28:20.858
SCHULTZ AGAIN AND SO FIRST WHAT

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.526
WE WOULD SAY IS WE CERTAINLY

02:28:22.593 --> 02:28:25.062
FAIR SHARE YOUR CONCERN-

02:28:25.129 --> 02:28:26.764
RELATIVE TO THE WAY IN WHICH

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:29.734
THE LANGUAGE IS CRAFTED. AND WE

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.269
ARE STILL KIND OF ASSESSING

02:28:31.335 --> 02:28:34.438
WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN- BUT KIND

02:28:34.505 --> 02:28:37.808
OF A BOTTOM LINE THAT IF- THE-

02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:40.177
TREASURY GUIDANCE DOES NOT GIVE

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:42.580
ANY KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AROUND.

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:45.449
ITEMS RELATED TO CONFORMITY. IT

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:47.551
WOULD. IT WOULD BASICALLY BE

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:49.086
TWICE THE COST OF WHAT WAS

02:28:49.153 --> 02:28:51.455
PREVIOUSLY BEING CONTEMPLATED

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:51.922
AND DELIBERATED BY THE

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:54.759
LEGISLATURE SO. THE VALUE OF

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:57.194
THAT TAX CONFORMITY WOULD ALSO

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.897
REDUCE THE AMOUNT AT THE TWENTY

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:01.098
SIX BILLION LEDGER ANALYST

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:03.200
MENTIONED. THAT WOULD COME TO

02:29:03.267 --> 02:29:04.535
THE STATE SO. THAT WOULD BE.

02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:07.638
KIND OF TO IMPACTS- WE- WE ARE

02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:10.441
OBVIOUSLY- WORKING CAREFULLY

02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:13.077
AND CLOSELY TO- TRY TO ADDRESS

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:15.246
SOME OF THAT UNCERTAINTY. WE

02:29:15.313 --> 02:29:16.681
DON'T WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT AND

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.249
CERTAINTY IS. GOING TO BE

02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:20.751
INTERPRETED THE SAME WAY- AS-

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.420
AND KIND OF IT MAY LOOK ON THE

02:29:22.486 --> 02:29:24.488
SURFACE SO REALLY. IS GOING TO

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:26.390
DEPEND ON THEIR INTERPRETATION

02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:28.292
AT THE TREASURY LEVEL. WHAT

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:30.094
OPTIONS AND THE STATE HAS

02:29:30.161 --> 02:29:31.228
RELATIVE TO THE USE OF THE

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:34.298
FUNDS. AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:35.766
TO GET MORE CLARITY THROUGH

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:36.867
THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE IN THE

02:29:36.934 --> 02:29:38.269
COMING WEEKS AND ARE WORKING

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:40.404
WITH. OUR CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:43.074
AS WELL AS VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:45.009
TO KIND OF FRAME OUR CONCERNS-

02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:46.977
AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:48.913
ALONE ACROSS MANY STATES.

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:49.947
INCLUDING THOSE THAT

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:53.818
AUTOMATICALLY. CONFORM TO SOME

02:29:53.884 --> 02:29:54.919
OF THESE PROVISIONS. CAN YOU

02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:57.088
YOU EXPLAIN HOW HOW WOULD IT

02:29:57.154 --> 02:30:01.592
DOUBLE THE COST. OF THE- OF THE

02:30:01.659 --> 02:30:07.164
PROPOSAL. SURE SO AND THAT YOU

02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:09.133
WOULD TAKE YOU WITH AND HAVE

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.068
THE REVENUE REDUCTION THAT WAS

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:13.137
CONTEMPLATED- THROUGH NOT

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:15.573
CONFORMING SO THAT THAT WOULD

02:30:15.639 --> 02:30:17.007
BE AN IMPACT ON THE REVENUE

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:19.744
SIDE AND THEN THE TWENTY SIX

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.946
BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:23.547
CALIFORNIA OR IS ESTIMATED FOR

02:30:23.614 --> 02:30:24.915
CALIFORNIA IN THE AMERICAN

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:27.718
RESCUE PLAN WOULD GET REDUCED

02:30:27.785 --> 02:30:30.788
BY AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT. SO TO

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:31.789
THE I GUESS THEN THE NEXT

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:35.326
QUESTION WOULD BE. IF WE WERE

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:38.562
TO USE THE STATE. WINDFALL AND

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:41.098
NOT ACCESS THE ARE NOT UTILIZED

02:30:41.165 --> 02:30:43.467
TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:46.003
CONFORMITY IS THAT ALLOWED. I

02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:49.073
WOULD PRESUME THAT IT IS IT IS

02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:52.076
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. SURE SORRY

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:54.311
ABOUT THAT- IT'S NOT ACTUALLY

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:56.680
ABOUT AND USING THOSE FEDERAL

02:30:56.747 --> 02:30:58.382
FUNDS IT'S MORE THE PERCEPTION

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:01.152
THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS IS

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:03.053
PROVIDING- RELIEF TO. ALL

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.089
GOVERNMENTS AND THAT THOSE

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:06.257
FUNDS WOULD THEN BE USED TO

02:31:06.323 --> 02:31:08.559
SUBSIDIZE ACT TAX CUTS THE

02:31:08.626 --> 02:31:10.895
GENERAL FUND- UNDERSTANDING OF

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.329
WHAT SOME OF THE FEDERAL

02:31:12.396 --> 02:31:14.331
THINKING WAS AT THE TIME THAT

02:31:14.398 --> 02:31:17.568
BILL WAS PASSED. AND I THINK IT

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:18.536
WOULD HAVE TO BE STRUCTURED

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:21.138
VERY DIFFERENTLY AND NOT TAKE

02:31:21.205 --> 02:31:23.941
THE SHAPE OF A TAX REDUCTION OR

02:31:24.008 --> 02:31:26.844
REVENUE PRODUCTION TO BE ABLE

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:30.748
TO- IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:31.282
DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE THAT

02:31:31.348 --> 02:31:34.118
DOUBLE AND- IMPACT AND WHAT I

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:36.253
WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT. YOU

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.588
KNOW IDEALLY WHAT WE WOULD DO

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:39.523
IS WORK WITH THE TREASURY AND

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:42.126
GET MORE CLARITY ON WHETHER THE

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.394
PROVISIONS THAT WERE ENACTED R.

02:31:43.461 --> 02:31:46.030
AS RESTRICT AS THEY MIGHT BE

02:31:46.096 --> 02:31:47.498
BEING PERCEIVED AT THIS POINT

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:49.667
SO I THINK FIRST STEP IS TO

02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:53.170
WORK WITH. US TREASURY AND THE

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:56.841
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. TO GET

02:31:56.907 --> 02:31:58.542
MORE CLARITY AROUND THE ISSUE.

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.411
I GUESS I AM I BY APPRECIATE

02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:01.512
THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS

02:32:01.579 --> 02:32:04.448
THERE IS THERE. REMAINING FUNDS

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:07.284
IN THE STATE SURPLUS TO DO

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:09.653
CONFORMITY THAT WOULD AND SO

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:10.287
THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:13.891
UTILIZE. THE FEDERAL FUNDS I

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:14.458
GUESS MAYBE THAT'S A BETTER

02:32:14.525 --> 02:32:18.529
QUESTION TO ASK. I AM SO YOU

02:32:18.596 --> 02:32:20.030
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT INSTEAD

02:32:20.097 --> 02:32:22.199
OF REVENUE RELIEF AND AN

02:32:22.266 --> 02:32:24.335
EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:26.170
COMPARABLE OR SIMILAR AMOUNTS

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:28.506
OF RELIEF TO THOSE BUSINESSES

02:32:28.572 --> 02:32:30.641
ADAM RIGHT TO TAKE THAT THE CAT

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:31.475
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TO TAKE

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:34.111
FUNDING IN THE STATE. THE STATE

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:36.547
SURPLUS NOT INTERVIEWS THE TO

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:38.616
USE THAT FOR CONFORMITY AND I

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:39.183
THINK THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL

02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:42.152
INTENT RIGHT I THINK I THINK MY

02:32:42.219 --> 02:32:44.455
COLLEAGUE IS ASKING- IF WE

02:32:44.522 --> 02:32:49.193
UTILIZE. THE STATE'S MONEY. FOR

02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.897
THE- RELIEF- WOULD THAT BE

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:53.931
ALLOWABLE AND I THINK I THINK

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:57.535
MIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

02:32:57.601 --> 02:33:00.070
THAT IF WE DID DO THAT RENO TAX

02:33:00.137 --> 02:33:02.239
RELIEF THROUGH DOES MATTER IT'S

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:03.774
ALL IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IT OUT OF

02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:06.944
OUR GENERAL FUND- DAD MY

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:08.646
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT OUR

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:09.980
ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL%

02:33:10.047 --> 02:33:11.749
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE REDUCED

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:14.084
COMMENSURATELY SO FOR EXAMPLE.

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:15.386
IF IT WAS YOU KNOW SEVEN

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.788
BILLION DOLLARS OF TAX RELIEF

02:33:17.855 --> 02:33:19.690
WE WOULD LOSE SEVEN BILLION

02:33:19.757 --> 02:33:21.525
DOLLARS IN RECOVERYFUNDS FROM.

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:22.960
WASHINGTON OKAY THAT'S IT YEAH

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:24.295
SO IS IT IS IT JUST THE FACT

02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:26.196
THAT WE'RE DOING RELIEF THAT

02:33:26.263 --> 02:33:27.498
THAT'S WHAT'S THE TRIGGER TO

02:33:27.565 --> 02:33:31.001
REDUCE. THE AMOUNT FROM THE

02:33:31.068 --> 02:33:31.602
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:34.738
NOT NOT HOW WE USE THAT RECORD

02:33:34.805 --> 02:33:35.339
NOT APPLYING THE MONEY TO TWO

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:39.476
DIFFERENT THINGS. YEAH THE MAIN

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:43.180
TRIGGER IS- I'M TAKING

02:33:43.247 --> 02:33:44.682
IMPLEMENTING A LAW IN

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:47.618
CALIFORNIA AFTER MARCH THIRD

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:51.422
THAT HAS A NET REDUCTION IN THE

02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:53.490
STATE'S OVERALL REVENUE I'M

02:33:53.557 --> 02:33:57.494
FRAMEWORK SO. AND EVEN AND THIS

02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:59.430
IS A CAN ASSIST POTENTIAL SO WE

02:33:59.496 --> 02:34:02.032
DON'T KNOW WITH CERTAINTY AS

02:34:02.099 --> 02:34:04.134
YACHTS AND- THE GUIDANCE IS

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:06.003
GOING TO BE FRAMED BUT IF YOU

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:08.238
DO SO AND THEN IT HAS THOSE

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:11.942
PENALTY KIND OF. BUILT INTO IT

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:13.344
SO IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THEN

02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:15.980
YOU DON'T HAVE THE PENALTY- BUT

02:34:16.046 --> 02:34:17.615
IF THERE IF THERE IS A REVENUE

02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:20.317
ACTION THAT WOULD CAUSE THE

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:23.787
REDUCTION AND I IN CAN BE CASH

02:34:23.854 --> 02:34:24.922
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:26.323
WOULD BE PROVIDED TO US SALAS I

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:27.358
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR.

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.793
CLARIFYING SO IT'S NOT THAT THE

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.364
USE OF THE IT'S NOT HELD THEM

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.198
WHICH WHICH- WHERE THE FUNDS

02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:35.466
COME FROM IT'S THE ACTUAL

02:34:35.532 --> 02:34:38.902
ACTION OF DOING. TAX RELIEF

02:34:38.969 --> 02:34:41.672
THAT IS CREATING V. THE

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.273
UNCERTAINTY OR THAT THAT NEEDS

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.009
CLARITY IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:47.945
IS THAT ACCURATE TO SAY. YES

02:34:48.012 --> 02:34:49.380
THE WAY IN WHICH THE FEDERAL

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:52.282
STATUTE WAS FRAMED IS CREATING

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:55.152
THE UNCERTAINTY I AM I THINK

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:57.354
YOU KNOW BRADLEY IT IS OUR

02:34:57.421 --> 02:34:59.356
INTENT TO ULTIMATELY USE

02:34:59.423 --> 02:35:01.692
GENERAL FUND TO DO SOMETHING IN

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:05.195
THAT- THE REAL QUESTION IS

02:35:05.262 --> 02:35:07.831
ABOUT THE APPROACH AT THIS TIME

02:35:07.898 --> 02:35:09.867
AND TELEMARKETER. THIS ISSUE I

02:35:09.933 --> 02:35:11.068
JUST GOT OFF AN EXAMPLE OF

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:13.237
SOMETHING WE JUST DID SO WE

02:35:13.303 --> 02:35:15.773
PROVIDED- A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF-

02:35:15.839 --> 02:35:17.841
TAX AND FEE RELIEF TO SMALL

02:35:17.908 --> 02:35:18.676
BUSINESSES AT THE SAME TIME WE

02:35:18.742 --> 02:35:21.512
DID. ALSO A TWO BILLION DOLLAR

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:24.448
GRANT PROGRAM SO BASED BASED ON

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:25.549
OUR INITIAL READING I'M NOT

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:27.084
SAYING THIS IS WHAT THE FINAL

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:28.085
READING WILL BE BASED ON THIS

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:29.586
INITIAL READING. THE TWO

02:35:29.653 --> 02:35:31.221
BILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM

02:35:31.288 --> 02:35:33.757
WHERE WE ARE AGAIN EXPANDING

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:35.459
MONEY. WOULD SEEM TO BE AN

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:37.127
APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS WILL

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:38.729
ALLOW THE USE OF FUNDS. BUT

02:35:38.796 --> 02:35:43.834
THE- FEE AND THE TAX REDUCTION

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:46.503
WHICH IS A REVENUE REDUCTION.

02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:48.939
WOULD NOT BE IS THAT IS OUT OF.

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:50.841
FAIR COMPARISON I GUESS I'M A

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:55.245
FINANCE EARLIER. YES THE STATE

02:35:55.312 --> 02:35:57.014
WOULD HAVE MUCH MORE LATITUDE

02:35:57.081 --> 02:35:58.716
IN TERMS OF HOW WE STRUCTURE

02:35:58.782 --> 02:36:01.051
THE GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE

02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:03.353
FRAMEWORK THERE'S IN FACT BROAD.

02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:04.955
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FORT CARE

02:36:05.022 --> 02:36:06.557
ACT CATEGORIES THAT THE LEGEND

02:36:06.623 --> 02:36:08.792
ALMOST DESCRIBED RELATIVE TO

02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:10.260
PROVIDING KIND OF GRANTS AND

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:12.629
ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:15.265
AND OTHERS AFFECTED BY KOPEN.

02:36:15.332 --> 02:36:17.234
SO I I'VE I'VE I CERTAINLY

02:36:17.301 --> 02:36:19.103
APPRECIATE THIS YEAR'S- EXAMPLE

02:36:19.169 --> 02:36:21.238
AYE AYE IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE

02:36:21.305 --> 02:36:23.474
ANY SENSE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.210
HAMSTRING A STATE'S ABILITY TO

02:36:26.276 --> 02:36:27.978
DO TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS OR DID

02:36:28.045 --> 02:36:30.114
TO DICTATE OUR OWN TAX POLICY

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.683
TO PROVIDE RELIEF. TO OF ALL

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:33.951
THINGS TO SMALL BUSINESSES

02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:35.419
STRUGGLING TO THE PANDEMIC THAT

02:36:35.486 --> 02:36:36.553
WOULD BE THE ONE THING I WOULD

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:37.988
THINK THAT THE FUNDS SHOULD BE

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:40.724
USED FOR. IS TO ACTUALLY HELP

02:36:40.791 --> 02:36:42.359
SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:43.560
WHEN I DON'T THINK THE CITY

02:36:43.627 --> 02:36:44.628
CALIFORNIA I DON'T BELIEVE THE

02:36:44.695 --> 02:36:46.430
POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:47.598
IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:36:47.664 --> 02:36:50.534
SHOULD BE GENERATING REVENUE ON

02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:53.303
EMERGENCY RELIEF PROVIDED THE

02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:54.972
PPP LANDS AND MY- I'M AGAIN I

02:36:55.038 --> 02:36:56.039
WOULD HOPE THE GOVERNOR WOULD

02:36:56.106 --> 02:36:58.809
SHARE THAT POSITION. IS THAT IS

02:36:58.876 --> 02:37:03.814
THAT TRUE. CERTAINLY I THINK

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.315
GIVEN THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:06.250
COLLECTIVELY WITH THE

02:37:06.316 --> 02:37:08.452
LEGISLATURE AND GOD THAT IS NOT

02:37:08.519 --> 02:37:10.821
AN ACCURATE. SO THE SO THE GOAL

02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:12.923
IS OBVIOUSLY TO DO P. B. P.

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:15.325
CONFORMITY BUT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:37:15.392 --> 02:37:15.926
GET CLARITY ON WHETHER WE CAN

02:37:15.993 --> 02:37:18.328
DO IT. WITH THIS LAW BEING

02:37:18.395 --> 02:37:21.465
PASSED IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH WE

02:37:21.532 --> 02:37:23.567
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

02:37:23.634 --> 02:37:26.637
RIGHT NOW ABOUT AND WHAT WHAT

02:37:26.703 --> 02:37:29.173
IT MEANS EXACTLY RELATIVES OF

02:37:29.239 --> 02:37:30.140
THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE BUT I

02:37:30.207 --> 02:37:31.441
THINK THAT THE CONTINUED

02:37:31.508 --> 02:37:34.211
COMMITMENT TO SPARE. SO I AND I

02:37:34.278 --> 02:37:35.245
GUESS THIS IS THE HYPOTHETICAL

02:37:35.312 --> 02:37:36.346
BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK IT BUT

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:38.782
INSTEAD GAVE IF THE LAW IS

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:40.517
CLEAR THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW US

02:37:40.584 --> 02:37:43.020
TO DO IT. WOULD WE APPEAL THAT

02:37:43.086 --> 02:37:43.987
IT WOULD BE WOULD WE SUPPORT

02:37:44.054 --> 02:37:46.890
LEGISLATION- TO TRY TO ALLOW US

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:52.863
TO DO THAT. WELL THAT'S IT SO.

02:37:52.930 --> 02:37:55.799
RIGHT SO OUR OUR FIRST- KIND OF

02:37:55.866 --> 02:37:57.768
EFFORTS- WHICH ARE ALREADY

02:37:57.835 --> 02:38:00.437
UNDER WAY ARE SEEKING

02:38:00.504 --> 02:38:02.072
ADDITIONAL CLARITY RELATIVE TO

02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:05.709
THE GUIDANCE AND WE ARE WORKING

02:38:05.776 --> 02:38:07.244
AGAIN THROUGH VARIOUS

02:38:07.311 --> 02:38:08.846
ORGANIZATIONS ARE CALIFORNIA

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:11.148
DELEGATION I'M BACK IN

02:38:11.215 --> 02:38:13.550
WASHINGTON DC TO FRAME OUR

02:38:13.617 --> 02:38:15.853
CONCERNS HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:18.622
IS CLARITY NEEDED- FOCUSING ON

02:38:18.689 --> 02:38:20.424
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN STATES

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:21.692
THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

02:38:21.758 --> 02:38:25.262
CONFORM TO FEDERAL TAX- CHANGES

02:38:25.329 --> 02:38:26.630
VERSUS STATES THAT HAVE TO KIND

02:38:26.697 --> 02:38:29.533
OF PRO ACTIVELY TAKE A STAB AND

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:32.102
IMPLEMENT- STATUTORY CHANGES TO

02:38:32.169 --> 02:38:33.837
DO SO WE THINK IT YOU KNOW

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:36.073
THERE'S THIS BIG. DISPARITY IT

02:38:36.139 --> 02:38:37.841
IT IS UNCLEAR THAT THAT WAS THE

02:38:37.908 --> 02:38:41.178
INTENT IT'S JUST THAT- IN IN

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:43.480
DRAFTING I THINK THAT THEY WERE

02:38:43.547 --> 02:38:44.982
TRYING TO SOLVE ONE PROBLEM AND

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:46.116
PERHAPS CREATED A DIFFERENT

02:38:46.183 --> 02:38:48.151
PROBLEM FOR STATES AND SO WE'RE

02:38:48.218 --> 02:38:51.088
WORKING AND TIRELESSLY TO BE

02:38:51.154 --> 02:38:53.190
ABLE TO GET BACK CLARITY AND-

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:55.092
HELP TO GET IT AND THE COMING

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:56.894
WEEKS. THIS ONLY RAISES A LOT

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:59.029
OF CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS TO-

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:00.330
WHICH I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.832
STATES ARE PROBABLY GOING TO

02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:02.900
EXAMINE I HOPE THAT WE WOULD

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:07.571
JOIN- THOSE- THOSE THOSE LEGAL-

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:10.908
EFFORTS TO IF NECESSARY- DO YOU

02:39:10.974 --> 02:39:13.377
HAVE A TIME LINE IN TERMS OF

02:39:13.443 --> 02:39:14.611
WHEN WE WOULD GET THAT CLARITY

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:16.113
I MEAN I KNOW THAT A LOT OF

02:39:16.179 --> 02:39:17.714
FOLKS OF ASK FOR EXTENSIONS

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:21.051
BECAUSE MONDAY WAS- THE TAX

02:39:21.118 --> 02:39:23.954
DEADLINE- SO. IF YOU DO YOU

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:25.923
HAVE A SENSE OF WHEN WE WOULD

02:39:25.989 --> 02:39:26.924
GET THAT TYPE OF CLARITY SO

02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:28.058
SAID THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:33.730
COULD. PLANT A PATH FORWARD. WE

02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:36.233
HAVE NO. NO SIGN ARE. WHEN THE

02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:38.168
FEDERAL GUIDANCE WILL BE ISSUED

02:39:38.235 --> 02:39:40.871
WE DO NOTE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS

02:39:40.938 --> 02:39:43.106
HAVE A DEADLINE WITHIN THE-

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:45.142
AMERICAN RESCUE PLANNED- WHICH

02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:46.643
IS SIXTY DAYS FROM THE DATE OF

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.879
AN ENACTMENT DOT DOT IS THE

02:39:48.946 --> 02:39:51.281
ONLY THING WE DO KNOW- RELATIVE

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:52.816
TO WHAT. WHAT STEPS WHAT

02:39:52.883 --> 02:39:54.384
TIMELINE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:58.822

02:39:58.889 --> 02:39:59.790
WANNA GET UP IN THE L. A. O.

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:01.325
DID DID THAT IF THE IF THEY

02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:03.060
WANTED TO OPINE ON THIS ISSUE.

02:40:03.126 --> 02:40:05.829
AND DO YOU HAVE A- PERSPECTIVE

02:40:05.896 --> 02:40:09.099
ON THIS. RIGHT NOW I THINK I

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:10.934
WOULD JUST ECHO THE DEPARTMENT

02:40:11.001 --> 02:40:12.602
OF FINANCE COMMENTS THAT WE- WE

02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:14.237

U. S. TREASURY GUIDANCE- AND

02:40:17.207 --> 02:40:17.708
ARE CAREFULLY MONITORING THE

02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:21.044
SITUATION- IT TO. THE TOP OF

02:40:21.111 --> 02:40:22.346
THE TUBE TRANSITION TO THEM TO

02:40:22.412 --> 02:40:23.413
THE L. A. O. AND TERMS OF

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:24.214

MENTIONED THAT THE IN YOUR- AND

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:29.386
YOUR ANALYSIS IS JUST FIVE

02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:29.987

02:40:31.922 --> 02:40:34.257
OF. BREAK THAT DOWN A BIT MORE

02:40:34.324 --> 02:40:34.891
IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE PROJECTS

MONITORING IT DOES A VERY BROAD

02:40:42.065 --> 02:40:44.234
WORK I MEAN IT'S VERY BROAD

02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:46.003
ARRAY BROAD BUCKETS. THE OTHER

02:40:46.069 --> 02:40:47.771
LANGUAGE APPEARS RELATIVELY

02:40:47.838 --> 02:40:48.839
FLEXIBLE AGAIN I THINK WE'RE

02:40:48.905 --> 02:40:50.640
GONNA WAIT FOR MORE GUIDANCE

02:40:50.707 --> 02:40:51.742

02:42:30.807 --> 02:42:31.808
FIVE BILLION SO 10% OF THE

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:33.243
TOTAL PART OF THAT BUT THE

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:35.445
BIGGEST CHUNK IS. IT'S SORT OF

02:42:35.512 --> 02:42:38.615
LIKE A STATE. NO PROBLEM MOST

02:42:38.682 --> 02:42:39.516

COMPREHENSIVE AFTER SCHOOL

02:42:56.166 --> 02:42:57.601

FROM PREVIOUS- OUR PREVIOUS ARE

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:10.547
AROUND THE FUNDING WHERE THE

02:43:10.614 --> 02:43:13.383
STATE COMING WITH QUICKLY.

FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ONE DOLLARS.

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:18.488
THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE MORE

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:21.424
DISCUSS FOR DECIDING HOW TO USE.

02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:22.893
THIS IS SO CAN I ASK HOW DOES.

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.528
THIS ADDITIONAL SO. FUNDS HOW

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.296
DOES IT INTERACT. THE RECENT

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:28.398
ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:43:28.465 --> 02:43:30.500
TERMS OF. IN PERSON LEARNING

LEARNING LOTS OF ACTIVITIES

02:43:33.270 --> 02:43:35.405
THAT THE STATE DID IS IT IS IT

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:50.887
ON. IT ON TOP. OF HOW DID HOW

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:51.421
DO THEY INTERACT WITH EACH

02:43:51.488 --> 02:43:57.494
OTHER. IMAGINE THERE IS A

02:43:57.561 --> 02:43:59.329
REQUIREMENT THAT 20% OF THE

02:43:59.396 --> 02:44:01.164
FUNDING THAT IS DISTRIBUTED

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:02.499
DIRECTLY TO LOCALS TO LOCAL

02:44:02.566 --> 02:44:03.667
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

02:44:03.733 --> 02:44:05.535
SCHOOLS GOING TO BE USED FOR MY

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:06.570
LEARNING OFF ACTIVITIES SO

02:44:06.636 --> 02:44:07.604
THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL

02:44:07.671 --> 02:44:09.673
AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.041
THAT THEY COULD BE USE THOSE

02:44:11.107 --> 02:44:13.076
PURPOSES THE PERFORMING WHILE A

02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:16.046
FEW MORE YEARS A BIG IN IN- THE

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:18.515
TIMING ALLOWS- SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:44:18.582 --> 02:44:19.583
HAS BEEN OUT OVER A LONGER

02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:20.617
PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT'S

02:44:20.684 --> 02:44:22.819
SOMETHING THAT- THEY WOULD HAVE

02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:23.787
TO TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES. AND

02:44:23.853 --> 02:44:25.121
THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTICE

02:44:25.188 --> 02:44:26.456
THAT THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:27.958
WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THE

02:44:28.024 --> 02:44:29.526
FEDERAL FORMULA WHICH IS

02:44:29.593 --> 02:44:32.229
USUALLY THE TITLE ONE FORMULA

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:34.197
IS NOT PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIALLY

02:44:34.264 --> 02:44:37.133
MORE FUNDING FOR WORK- SCHOOL

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:38.168
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A HIGHER

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.869
PERCENTAGES OF LOW INCOME

02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:42.572
STUDENTS IT'S NOT. THE STATE

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:43.807
FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED VIA OF

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:44.975
THE ACROPOLIS ALSO DOES PROVIDE

02:44:45.041 --> 02:44:47.677
FROM ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:49.246
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY MEMBERS

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:49.980
WOULD NOT CONSIDER BECAUSE

02:44:50.046 --> 02:45:02.092
WE'RE BUT THE FUNDING IF.

02:45:02.158 --> 02:45:02.826
PROVIDER A GREATER DIFFERENCE

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:08.765
IN TERMS OF THE LOWER- HI

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:10.033
INCOME AND LOWER SCHOOLS. OKAY

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:11.601
SO THE FIRST THE FUNDING

02:45:11.668 --> 02:45:12.402
STREAMS ARE DEAF BUT IT TO THE

02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:13.670
C. AREA SO IN PER LEARNING

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:15.105

IT COULD OR A DIFFERENT SYSTEM

02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:52.102

A CALL BACKS IS THERE CERTAIN

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:09.152
REQUIREMENTS STRINGS ATTACHED

02:47:09.219 --> 02:47:11.221
TO THESE THAT THESE FUNDS THAT

HOMELESSNESS AND HARMONICIST

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:16.393
I'M JUST IN GENERAL IN GENERAL

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:17.727
BUT I GUESS YOU COULD WE COULD

TALK ABOUT THAT IS THE TWENTY

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:20.663
SIX BILLION IN THE RECOVERY BUT

02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:22.232
IF THERE ARE OTHER. STRINGS I

GUESS. WE APPRECIATE THAT.

02:47:25.635 --> 02:47:27.404
INFORMATION HE ADDED SIX

02:47:27.470 --> 02:47:28.805
BILLION IS THE AMOUNT THAT HAS

02:47:28.872 --> 02:47:30.473
THE MOST DIRECT SORT OF FISCAL

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.108
OR BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS FOR

02:47:32.175 --> 02:47:33.410
THE STATE I MEAN I THINK THE

02:47:33.476 --> 02:47:35.645
QUESTION IS STILL AROUND. HOW

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:37.781
MUCH THIS IS GOING TO REPLACE

02:47:37.847 --> 02:47:40.550
START OF EXISTING EXPENDITURES-

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:41.551
FOR THE STATE AND PROVIDE

02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:43.486
FISCAL RESPONSE THIS GOAL-

02:47:43.553 --> 02:47:45.455
FLEXIBILITY AND NOT RESPECT OR

02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:46.556
HOW MUCH OF IT IS BASICALLY

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:47.924
JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE SPENT ON

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:52.095
NEW PURPOSES- GIVEN THAT B. R.

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:53.863
REVENUE LOSSES ARE DEFINED

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:55.698
RELATIVE TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I

02:47:55.765 --> 02:47:56.766
THINK WE STILL HAVE TO KIND OF

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:57.734
UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL. WHAT YOU

02:47:57.801 --> 02:47:59.436
KNOW OR IS THIS ALL FUNDS IT

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:01.905
JUST GENERAL FUND FOR EXAMPLE-

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:04.274
IT'S THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.475
KEY CRITERIA WHERE THERE WOULD

02:48:05.542 --> 02:48:08.411
BE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ON THE

02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:09.646
STATE TO USE THE FUNDS IN A WAY

02:48:09.712 --> 02:48:10.480
THAT YOU KNOW SORT OF

02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:11.614
SUPPLANTED EXISTING

02:48:11.681 --> 02:48:13.516
EXPENDITURES AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:15.084
BEING A SUPPLEMENTAL AMOUNT-

02:48:15.151 --> 02:48:16.820
AND GIVEN THAT THE THAT THE

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:19.389
STATE'S REVENUE PERFORMANCE FOR

02:48:19.456 --> 02:48:20.557
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY. FOR

02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:22.492
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- IT LOOKS

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:23.660
LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE ABOVE THE

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:26.329
PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL AND THEN IT

02:48:26.396 --> 02:48:27.764
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL

02:48:27.831 --> 02:48:28.698
BE THAT THE STATE'S GOING TO BE

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:31.434
ABLE TO KIND OF USE THAT

02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:32.535
MECHANISM THAT VERY MUCH SO.

02:48:32.602 --> 02:48:33.436
THERE'S STILL KIND OF QUESTIONS

02:48:33.503 --> 02:48:35.171
AROUND HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:36.606
TO PROVIDE KIND OF. FISCAL

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.707
RELIEF IN THE SENSE THAT YOU

02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:40.710
WOULD THINK- IT IS KIND OF A

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.812
SUB PLANTATION OF FEDERAL OF-

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:44.080
EXISTING STATE EXPENDITURES

02:48:44.147 --> 02:48:45.982
VERSUS MORE OF A SUPPLEMENTAL.

02:48:46.049 --> 02:48:47.684
PAYMENT WHERE THE STATE HAS YOU

02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:48.751
KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:51.087
ESSENTIALLY TO SPEND THE MONEY

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:53.656
ON NEW PURPOSES. OKAY AND THEN

02:48:53.723 --> 02:48:55.725
OF COURSE- THAT WITH THE NOT

02:48:55.792 --> 02:48:57.227
BARRING THAT THE CLARITY THAT

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:59.796
WE NEED FOR THE RELIEF I GUESS

02:48:59.863 --> 02:49:02.232
THAT'S THAT THE OTHER BIG- DIED

02:49:02.298 --> 02:49:03.366
IN THAT WE NEED TO GET. A

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:07.670
ANSWER ON YES. YES YES. I THINK
