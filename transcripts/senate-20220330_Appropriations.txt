AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS JOINT AUTHOR AND I ARE PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE WHICH WILL EXTEND EVICTION PRO PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS WHO HAVE FILED FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH SINCE THE RATE REALLY PROGRAM LAUNCHED ONE YEAR AGO CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN DELIVERING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THAT ARE MOST IN NEED AND RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING. THE STATE PROGRAM HAS DELIVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO DATE HELPING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY OFF RENTAL DEBT AND AVOID EVICTION ONE IN THREE PAYMENTS NATIONALLY HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA TO TENANTS AND LANDLORDS THAT ARE IN NEED BUT IT IS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE STATE TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS FOR COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THOUSANDS AND THAT IS THOUSANDS CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR RELIEF WHILE OTHER APPLICATIONS PENDING IT WOULD BE CRUEL AND IT WOULD BE WASTEFUL AS WELL AS UNFAIR TO SUBJECT CALIFORNIANS TO EVICTION OR THE LOSS OF CONTROL IN NOW WHEN THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASK OF THEM AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF EMERGENCY RENTAL. ASSISTANCE IS IMMINENT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE CALIFORNIANS TO SUFFER TO LOSE THEIR HOMES OR EVEN THEIR INCOME BECAUSEOF APPLICATION PROCESSING TIMES SO AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE IS GOING TO HELP US TAKE CARE OF THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS TENANTS AND LANDLORDS ALIKE WHO APPLIED FOR COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND STILL HAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS PENDING. THIS WILL LET US MAXIMIZE EVERY LAST EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS TO PEOPLE- TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED AND ALSO- TO KEEP THIS GOING TO THE RAM THIS AND TO THE CHAIRED BY MAY JOINT AUTHORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBER. AFTER HEARING US OUT TODAY. I YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE HAD A CRISIS LONG BEFORE KOPEN- COVERED HAS EXACERBATED THAT CRISIS AND IT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BROWN A BLACK COMMUNITIES AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE. HEARD AND SEEN THOSE ISSUES IN OUR DISTRICTS- AND THERE'S MUCH WORK TO BE DONE SEPARATELY FROM THIS BILL RIGHT AROUND MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION MORE PROTECTION FOR TENANTS THAT WE DO HAVE TO TACKLE. YOU KNOW WHEN COLBERT HIT THE STATE TOOK ACTION YOU KNOW I WAS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT- WHICH THIS BODY PASSED- IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY TWO ESTABLISH EVICTION PROTECTIONS AND TO ENSURE THAT RENTERS. I WOULDN'T LOSE THEIR HOME BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY RENT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS HELPS OUR MOST VULNERABLE FOLKS WHO NEED THE ASSISTANCE MOST. OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. AS WE SPEAK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RENTERS HAVE APPLIED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY ARE STILL IN THE QUEUE AWAITING THAT ASSISTANCE. THAT WILL EXPIRE BY THE END OF DAY TOMORROW. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BODY BUT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE VOTE FOR THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE GET THE PROTECTIONS THEY NEED THAT WE HONOR OUR COMMITMENT AS GOVERNMENT WE SAY THEIR SYSTEMS FOR YOU. THAT WE HONOR THAT COMMITMENT AND WE SURE THAT THEY GET THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY- AND OBVIOUSLY NOW HERE IN THE SENATE- AND ALL RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT. YOU KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE PREEMPTION PIECES WHICH WE DISCUSSED OTHER COMMITTEES I'M SURE MANY OF YOU WILL RAISE IN THIS IN THIS CONVERSATION AND I HEAR THOSE CONCERNS BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO PASS THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE ARE PROTECTED FROM EVICTIONS AND THAT THAT LANDLORDS ARE MADE WHOLE THE TENANTS HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. SO THAT WE CAN THEN GO ON AND ADDRESS THE BIGGER CONCERNS AROUND OUR HOUSING CRISIS I WHICH I IMPLORE YOU ALL TO DO- AND WILL HAVE OTHER BILLS IN FRONT OF YOU- FOR IT FOR SAID- SAID WORK- BUT AGAIN I KNOW THE BILL'S NOT PERFECT WE DO HAVE TO PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY MY HOPE IS IT PASSES THE SENATE GETS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IN TIME. TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE- HOPING TO MAKE IT TO BE MADE WHOLE BY THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON IN THIS WEEK'S APPRECIATE IT- I AM NOT SHOWING ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE.

WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO ALL THOSE WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR AND OPPOSED- AS I NOTED IN THE OPENING COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NOT PARTICIPATING TODAY. SO LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO ANY OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE. MISTER WHITE HOUSE. SO ON THE ON THE FISCAL ANALYSIS THE MORATORIUM IS GOING TO END ON HURSDAY THIS BILL DOESN'T EXTENDED WOULD WOULD IT SHOULDN'T WE CHARACTERIZED AS FAR AS THE COST TO THE COURTS WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE ON ON THE NATURAL PEOPLE IF YOU WEREN'T HERE IF YOU HADN'T DONE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO FILE FOR AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER IS ON THE FIRST ANYWAY. IS THAT IS THAT A GOOD CHARACTERIZATION OF THE COST OF THIS BILL RIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE AN ACT I BELIEVE THAT BE AN ACCURATE OBSERVATION ASSESSMENT OF THE BILL YES AND ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL MONIES IN THE STATE MONIES THAT ARE IN THE POT TO PAY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEIR CHECKS. THAT MONEY'S ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED THAT'S THERE'S NO NEW MONEY TO HAVE TO SEND THAT MONEY OUT THAT MONEY IS THERE THE COST TO THE STATE HAS ALREADY BEEN BORN ON DIFFERENT BUDGETS AND WE'RE JUST. GIVING MORE TIME FOR PEOPLE TO CASH THE CHECKS. YES THAT'S CORRECT. AND TO THE EXTENT. THAT THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE GAVE. WERE FOR PEOPLE. THE- PEOPLE NEED IT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE NEEDED TO PROTECTIONS TWO YEARS AGO SO GOING FORWARD. D. WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS LOW AS IT'S BEEN AND WE'RE READING IN A NEWSPAPER BEGINNING IN APRIL WHO'S NOT GONNA BE INCLUDED AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT SOLELY FOR THE PANDEMIC AND OR CATCHING CATCHING KOPET THAT'S THE CO WORKERS. I WOULD SAY THE ORDINARY THE ORDINARY FICTIONS THAT GO ON IN ANY STATE IN CALIFORNIA DOES WOULD PRESUME BUT BUT WE WERE ONLY PROTECTING THE PEOPLE THAT WERE COVERED. UP TO SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IS THAT IS THAT. SO WE WERE PROTECTING ANYONE THAT ACTUALLY FILLED OUT AN APPLICATION AND THAT- PROTECTION CONTINUES- WE ARE EXTENDING THAT PROTECTION UNTIL WE CAN ACTUALLY ON OUR WORD IF THEY'RE IN THE EYE BLIND. THAN THOSE OF THE ONES WE ARE PROTECTING RECTIFY AND THE BUT THAT FISCAL AFFECTED IS GENERATED BY ORDERED. CONSTITUTED BY THE KOPET SOLELY FOR THE CALL KOPET UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY WRECKED ON. THE FACTS MAY HAVE BEEN- SO. THE BILL CREATES WHAT THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT- VIOLATIONS OF PEOPLE MADE THAT THE ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN IN THE COURTS AND THAT MAY BE A COSTS THAT HAVE TO BE BORN IF SOMEBODY IS FILE SOMEBODY'S WAITING FOR THEIR CHECK AND- LOOK THEIR LANDLORD. PATENT SIX ACTION THAT'S A STATE YOU KNOW THE COURTS ARE RUN BY THAT SO THAT THAT MAY BE A MINUSCULE POINT. YOU FOR THE BILL ALSO CREATES A DOUGHNUT HOLE FOR. TILL JULY FIRST WEEK WE'RE SAYING THAT THE WERE PREEMPTING LOCAL CONTROL FOR TILL JUNE THIRTIETH RIGHT SO THERE'S A DONUT HOLE THAT'S COULD BE CREATED. IS THERE ANYTHING. THAT THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON JULY FIRST TO DO THEIR OWN LOCAL ORDINANCES SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS. AND THAT AND THAT AND THAT FISCAL EFFECT WILL BE BORNE BY. THE COURTS RIGHT. CORRECT YES SO AS OF JULY. FIRST ST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN PUT FORTH THEIR OWN PROTECTION SHOULD THEY SEE FIT AND CERTAIN PROTECTIONS LIKE THE CITY OF OAKLAND WHICH WERE ALREADY EXISTING THOSE CAN CONTINUE. THEIR CERTAIN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO IN THE COUNTY OF LA THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN PLACE SO THAT'S WHERE THERE'S THE CONCERNS FROM THE CAMPS WE LIKE TO SAY IN SOUTH COUNTY THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA ALTHOUGH SO ALTHOUGH OAKLAND THE PASTOR OF THE ORDINANCE THE WHOLE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA CRACKED. YOUR CRACK PASSED ME WITH THIS BEFORE MISTER CHOOSE BILL WAS PASSED SO THAT WOULD THAT THAT WOULD BE NOT PROTECT. THANK YOU FOR THE FISCAL ANALYSIS. MISTER LEONARD I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES MISS BATES A QUESTION OF TO WHOM. DOES THE MONEY GO WHEN IT'S FINALLY RELEASED AS A GO TO A TENER THE PROPERTY OWNER. IT GOES TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. PROPERTY OWNER HANDLER THE LATE YEAH A NUMBER OF THEM ARE OPPOSED TO WHAT IS THE PROTECTION FOR THEM. AW IN THE MEANTIME JUST. IF THEY'VE MADE THE APPLICATION FOR- DIVERGENCE HE RELIEF. IF THEY'RE THEY'RE AWAITING MANY OF THEM ARE AWAITING FUNDS. RIGHT NOW FUNDS AND IS IT ACCURATE I'VE HEARD THIS NUMBER WHICH IS STAGGERING TO ME. THAT THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICATIONS WAITING. IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR UNEMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT KING. HAS THERE BEEN ANY REVIEW OF FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS. KNOWING THAT THIS MONEY IS GOING TO ACTUALLY GO FOR. A LEGITIMATE- I THINK I THINK YOU ARE REYES IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WE NEED TO HAVE A LOOK AT HOW THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN RUN AND ENSURE THAT IT IS RUN EFFECTIVELY- THERE'S ALSO BIG CONCERNS AROUND THE FACT THAT- FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING- AND THE MONEY HAS BEEN SLOW TO GET OUT SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE AS A BODY I THINK NEED TO. HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW IF WE ARE. PUTTING FORTH SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING THOSE SUCCESSFULLY THEY WERE HELPING THE FOLKS THAT WE THAT WE NEED. AND INTEND TO. END SURVEYS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP- AT THIS POINT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE APPLICATIONS IN THE PIPELINE. HAVE ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF. ACTUALLY GETTING THE MONEY AND WHICH WE ARE DOING THROUGH THIS. AND ACTUALLY CUTTING THE CHECKS AND SEND THEM OUT AND SO THAT'S- THE PURPOSE OF THE EXTENSION NOW IS ACTUALLY HONORING WHAT WE'VE ALREADY APPROVED IN THE APPLICATIONS. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF. INFORMATION TO BE PRESENT WHEN THIS IS FINALLY VOTED ON THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. IN SOME SORT OF ACTUAL VERIFICATION TESTING THAT THESE ARE ALL HAVE BEEN REVIEWED IN ARE LEGITIMATE THE FRIDAY. THERE'S GOING ON IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IS STAGGERING AD WE HAD A- I THINK IT'S A CHANNEL FOR NBC ARE- REPORT ON THAT REGARDING THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AND THE AMOUNT OF FRAUD. IT HAS BEEN A- PART OF ANY ONE OF THESE. VERY VERY COMPELLING VERY VERY IMPORTANT- SUBSTANCE SUBSTANCE. SUBSTANCE THIS YEAR. I'VE GOT SUBSTANCE ABUSE SOME OF MINE TOO BECAUSE I'M A BILL ALLOWED BACK ANYWAY- VERY VERY IMPORTANT VERY COMPELLING BUT THEY'RE VERY COMPELLING STORIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR PROPERTY. ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PAID WE HAD A VERY VERY. A TRAGIC REPRESENTATION ABOUT IT HOUSING- JUST THIS WEEK. A WOMAN LOSING HER PROPERTY BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PAY HER MORTGAGE IN IT IS FOR. INCOME FOR RETIREMENT INCOME. SO THAT'S A PROPERTY OWNER. WHO'S BEEN YOU KNOW VERY COMPASSIONATE WITH HER TENANTS BUT NOW. OUR COMPASSION IS GONE MONEY'S GONE HOMES GONE PROPERTIES GONE AND THIS IS PROPERTY THAT SHE- DID. THAT TALKING TO YOUR FAMILY. SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY TRY. TROUBLING INTO OF TRYING TO. BALANCE HERE. IF YOU ARE PROTECTED WITH THIS MEASURE IN THE AND IT EXPIRES JUNE THIRTY. IN YOUR THEN SUBJECT TO EVICTION WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. WHAT IS THE PROCESS WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO CORDON EVICTING SOMEONE WHEN THEY'VE EVEN BEEN GIVEN THIS TWO MONTH. EXTENSION BUTTON BUT IT'S OVER THAT WOULD PAY THE RENT. WHAT HAPPENS THEN I MEAN I THINK IT'S IN A SITUATION SOME HAS BEEN IN THE QUEUE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE A WHOLE RIGHT I THINK. THE EVICTION PROTECTIONS WITH THAT AND- AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S AT LEAST SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR ITSELF. SO THEY COULD CONTINUE TO OCCUPY THE RESIDENCE UNTIL THE COURT IN ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PART OF THIS WAS BACK IN. RIGHT THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. MISSED SOME LUGGAGE HAVE A QUESTION YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M GOING TO- TRY MY HARDEST TO KEEP MY QUESTIONS- FOCUSED ON FISCAL SINCE THIS IS A COMMITTEE- SO IF I FALTER. YOU CAN FORGIVE ME IN ADVANCE I DO WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT GIVEN THIS IS APPROPRIATIONS AND GIVEN THIS IS. ABOUT A FISCAL-ANALYSIS OF THE BILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOULD BE HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT FOLKS. HAVE WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE THEIR INPUT AND SO THAT'S JUST FOR THE RECORD. SO HOW COME OR MAYBE IT'S ME. DOES THIS BILL INCLUDE COSTS FOR STAFFING UP BECAUSE TO THE PRIOR QUESTION WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND FOLKS. STILL IN THE QUEUE AT THE STATE LEVEL WHO ARE WAITING FOR THEIR MONEY. AND WE KNOW THAT THE DELAY IN GETTING IT OUT HAS BEEN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING JUST NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO KIND OF PROCESS TO THE APPLICATION SO DOES THIS INCLUDE THAT. SO THAT HAS BEEN A PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND THE NEGOTIATION OF THIS BILL WAS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF. AND WHETHER THERE WAS ADEQUATE STAFF WHETHER THE POLICY OR THE PROCEDURES AND THE PROCESS WAS FLAWED OR IF THERE WERE SOME CHALLENGES OR OBSTACLES THAT WERE IN THE WAY. THOSE THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION BEING THAT IT'S THE AGENCY AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT THIS BILL HAS NOT ALLOCATED. THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STAFF THESE THE MONEY THAT'S AND THERE IS FOR THE RENTER AND LANDLORD. SO WE'RE GIVING. WE'RE EXTENDING TIME. TO HELP A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SLOW AND RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT PUTTING MORE PEOPLE ON BOARD TO HELP. MANAGE THIS IN A QUICKER MORE EFFICIENT WAY. IF I MAY- THE FLEAS FIND A- WE WOULD ONLY- ASSUME BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AND AN AGENCY- AND PEOPLE THAT RUN THE AGENCY AND PEOPLE ARE IN PERFECT THAT YES WE WOULD SAFELY ASSUME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN- SLOW- ACTIONS IN PROCESS HOWEVER I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO ALSO CONSIDER AND THAT WAS. THE LACK OF FUNDING THAT WAS COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE KNEW THE MONEY WAS COMING BUT IT WASN'T LANDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA QUICK ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DISPERSE INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT WERE IN THE PIPELINE HAVING APPROVED APPLICATIONS SO WHICH IS WHY CALIFORNIA IS STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND MAKING UP THAT DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW KNOWING THAT. THAT MONEY I'M EMINENTLY IS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO NOW THAT WE HAVE STEPPED UP WITH AN APPROPRIATION WE CAN NOW MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO HONOR THOSE CHECKS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. AND CAN I ALSO JEFF JUST ADD- I KNOW THAT WERE ALLOWED TO USE 10215% OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT WAS 10% FROM THE FIRST PART OF MONEY- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE APPLICATION DEADLINE IS TOMORROW SO NOT EXPECTING ANY NEW. APPLICANTS TO COME RIGHT AND SO WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP HERE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WITH THIS EXTENSION- THOUGH I HEAR YOUR POINTS AND I THINK WE ALL OF HER THEM FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AROUND THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PROGRAM- SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WE CAN USE SOME OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT HAND. FOR STAFFING. WELL I MEAN I JUST I SO I THINK THE APPROPRIATIONS IS FINE. BUT IT'S ALSO A MATTER OF LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY. FUNDED SO THAT YOU CAN DO THE BUSINESS I MEAN BECAUSE THE NARRATIVE IN IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S FLUSH WITH MONEY. AND SO WE COULD PROBABLY YOU KNOW. HEY UP FIRST AND FIGHT TO GET REIMBURSEMENT ON THE BACK I FROM THE FEDS IF THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT IS PROPERLY FUNDED THAT IS SCALABLE THAT IS GETTING MONEY OUT TO CONSTITUENTS AND JUST FOR THE RECORD I HAVE TO SAY IS VERY HARD TO HEAR WHEN YOUR OWN COUNTY CALLS IN TO SAY. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL. YOU KNOW IF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS THIS THING AT THE STATE LEVEL HAS GOTTEN OUT TO. YOU KNOW MAYBE REACHING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AS MEAN SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING ABOUT THE FISCAL PART OF THIS BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT RIGHT. AND I THINK. I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS AND- YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I DO THINK. AS THOSE ARE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING- AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THE GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS GIVE OURSELVES THAT TIME SAID THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN. IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM SO THAT THOSE THAT ARE ON THE HOOK WILL BE MADE WHOLE- BUT IDO THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE- SOME ANALYSIS AROUND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND SOME LESSONS LEARNED- THIS AND OTHER PROGRAMS DURING KOPEN I THINK FALL IN THAT SAME CATEGORY- BUT I SHARE THE CONCERN AND YOU'RE NOT WRONG TO RAISE THE FLAGS- BUT THE POINT OF THIS BILLS TO REALLY GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION MORE TIME. AND A CITY MORE TIME TO HONOR THOSE COMMITMENTS AND THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY TO IS I THINK THERE'S CONCERNS AROUND. THE OUTRAGE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE TIS PROGRAM- AS A GOVERNMENT THAT IT THAT EVEN EXISTED. AND CRITICALLY FOR NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND THOSE THAT MAYBE DON'T NAVIGATE GOVERNMENT- IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR OTHER ISSUES. THAT WAS A VERY REAL CONCERN AND IT IS BEEN BORNE OUT WHEN YOU SEE WHO IS ACTUALLY APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM- SO THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I DO THINK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SO HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT IF IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN JUNE TO GET TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE. I MEAN I THINK IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THAT WILL GIVE US ENOUGH TIME TO. TO HONOR ALL THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE HAD. I'M AT THE THRESHOLD OF GOING BEYOND THEFISCAL QUESTIONS SO I'M GONNA RELEASE MYSELF FROM MY OWN STRESS. THANK YOU. MISTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I TO- FOLLOWING LINES QUESTIONING THAT- SENATOR CALM WATER HAVE BECAUSE I TOO HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY MY COUNTY I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY A SMALL LANDLORDS AND BEGAN TO HAVE THIS MONEY AND REALLY THE STATE JUST LIKE ET DE WHERE THAT ROADBLOCK WE'RE THEY IMPEDIMENT AND SO THAT BE FLUSHED WITH CASH OR LEASE HAVING MONEY TO REIMBURSE AND- MAKE FOLKS HOLD BUT WE HAVE. NOT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DISSEMINATING GET THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE AND NEEDS IT IS ALMOST LIKE A FACADE IT'S ALMOST YOU KNOW THE ACTOR X. AND SO I THINK STANDING UP THESE AGENCIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY STAFF WILL ALLOW US TO. DO WHAT WE ARE ALL OUR INTENTIONS ARE TO MAKE PEOPLE HOLE BUT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERNAL WORKINGS WERE GONE YOU KNOW FIRST FIXED FASTER FRUSTRATION WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE A POOR STAFFING AND POOR PREPARATION FOR THIS SO I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE- FIRST QUESTIONS ASKED. IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO GET THESE CHECKS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S STILL NOT IN PLACE. SIR BRADFORD YOUR YOUR AGAIN RIGHT- ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS- WHAT YOU'VE MADE- HOWEVER- ALONG WITH THE CALL FOR IMPROVEMENT AND MAKING SURE STAFFING IS ADEQUATE. WE ARE FACING A DEADLINE THAT COMES TO US TOMORROW AND. IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION AND HELP PEOPLE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR STATE AGENCIES- AND IN DOING SO WE NEED ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE HOLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'VE DONE WHAT WE'VE ASKED HIM TO DO. NO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE DEADLINE AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION BUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING WELL BEFORE WE GOT HERE YOU KNOW AND MAKING SURE THESE AGENCIES WERE. PROPERLY STAFFED AND PREPARED TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO COMMENTS WELL TAKEN. FURTHER COMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.
