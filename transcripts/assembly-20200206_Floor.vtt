FRIEND'S MOTHER WAS A PART OF

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:54.851
HER GRANDMOTHER WAS A PART OF

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:57.120
THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT. AND

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.122
THEY OFTEN TALKED ABOUT HOW.

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:00.189
THOSE WOMEN IN THOSE

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:03.159

WALKING TO WORK. MILES AND

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.931
MILES OF WORK. THAT THEY WALKED

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:09.966
BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO RIDE THE

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.001

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.580
WHAT THEIR DESIRE TO NOT TAKE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.015
THE BUS. WAS ONE THAT WAS

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:29.652

THEY OFTEN WALKED. THROUGHS

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.632
THEY CARRY. THAT WALK ALL THE

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.167
PLACES THAT WOULD NOT WELL

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:46.135

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.637
WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE A

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:48.704
STATEMENT THAT THEY WOULD. RIDE

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.573
THE BUS THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.142
