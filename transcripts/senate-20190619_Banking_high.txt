INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE GOING TO CONVENE THE US. WE'RE GONNA CAM SENATE BANKING AND FINANCE AN INCH INSTITUTION COMMITTEE AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE WERE LACKING A QUORUM RIGHT NOW I SEE WE HAVE OUR FIRST. WITNESS ASSEMBLYMAN STONE SO WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU IN YOUR WITNESSES CAN COME. FOR AND WILL RECEIVE YOUR TESTIMONY ON ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B.. THREE SEVEN SIX AND WE'RE GONNA LIMITED TESTIMONY TO TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES AND THE REST CAN. APPROPRIATE TIME TO STATE. YOUR ME TO USE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS WITNESSES COME UP I JUST WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED AB THREE SEVENTY SIX AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE. TO STATE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS AND WE ARE TAKING ALL OF THOSE WORKING WITH. YOUR STAFF YOUR COMMITTEE AND THEN INTO THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH WILL BE SENATE JUDICIARY. AN EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY SIX IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT BUILDS ON WORK THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. WE CREATED. A LICENSING PROGRAM FOR STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS AND THIS IS THE STEP THAT GIVE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. SPECIFIC RIGHTS THAT THEY THEN CAN AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENFORCE GIVE AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE OPERATING IN. AND WHAT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE JUST FOR CALIFORNIA. ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS OUTSTANDING IN THIS A FAX ALMOST FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND WHEN WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY ON THE LICENSING PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT WAS REALLY A PARTNER IN THIS AND WE WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY AND WATCHING WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IN ORDER TO TAILOR CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM TO THE FEDS WHAT IS HAPPENED SINCE THEN IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS COMPLETELY WALKED AWAY. FROM STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN FACT FROM THEIR OBLIGATION ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS ALL TOGETHER. FIFTY BE IS BEING GUIDED. THE THE WORK THOSE PERMITS CATION THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON TO TRY TO PROTECT TO LOAN BORROWERS IS NOW KNOW WHERE AND THEY ARE ACTIVELY MOVING. TO PROTECT THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS WHO HAVE PROVEN TO BE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY SOME OF THE WORST ACTORS IN DEALING WITH THIS THAT. THIS IS THE SECOND HIGHEST AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT WE ARE SUFFERING BEHIND HOME MORTGAGES AND YET WE NOW HAVE. HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS WE PROTECT PEOPLE BORROWERS WITH CREDIT CARDS WE HAVE ALL OF THESE STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR DEBT. EXCEPT FOR STUDENT LOANS TO NON SERVICERS HAVE CONSTANTLY BEEN GIVING INCORRECT. INFORMATION TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN FACT THEY'RE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY KNOW -- NO OBLIGATION OF THE BAR WAS THEMSELVES. AND IN COURT HAVE SET THE BAR WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT. ANYTHING FROM THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS TO BENEFIT. WHICH IS A BIT ASTONISHING SINCE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EITHER HELP OR HURT THE AFTER WE PASS A LICENSING PROGRAM THERE ARE. A DOZEN STATES OR MORE WHO HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT DOING THE SAME THING ESPECIALLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BACKING OFF AND TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE RIGHTS AND AND ABILITIES IS TO NUMBERS HAD TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. NOW THOSE SAME STATES ARE LOOKING TO TO CALIFORNIA AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW THEY CAN BETTER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. TO THE STUDENT LOAN BILL OF RIGHTS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT TO THE BARBER'S. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YES WE NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY. TO REDUCE THE COST OF EDUCATION TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE INCURRING THE STATE BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE CANNOT LEAVE BEHIND ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE CARING THIS THAT. AND AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STAND UP FOR THEM WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE TOM'S DIRE. FROM NEXT GEN AND THE REVEREND MAX. SOCIO WHO IS A SACRAMENTO AND WHO HAS A STORY A PRETTY FRIGHTENING STORY ABOUT HAVING SUFFERED SOME OF THE SITUATIONS AND THE DEBT THAT HE IS CARRYING BECAUSE OF MISINFORMATION. FROM TO NON SERVICE THANK YOU STAR. CAN READ. FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI THREE SEVENTY SIX THE STUDENT BORROWER BILL OF RIGHTS. OF WHICH NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF THIS PROBLEM TO OUR WORK AT NEXT GEN. THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN IN ELEVEN STATES REGISTERING IN MOBILIZING THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE ARE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY COLLEGE CAMPUSES INCLUDING TWENTY IN CALIFORNIA. TALKING ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS CARE ABOUT MOST. OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE HEAR PLEASED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. WHEN OUR ORGANIZER'S CANVASSED YOUNG AMERICANS 61% OF THEM RANKED COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND STUDENT LOANS? IT'S ONE OF THEIR TOP CONCERNS. IN CALIFORNIA IT WAS 72%. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IN THE ISSUE OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS A PRIORITY FOR ME. AND FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. AND TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THOSE NUMBERS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF OUR NEXT GEN STAFFERS NAME SAMANTHA. WHO TOOK OUT NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAY FOR HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE? HE GRADUATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND ENDED THE WAR THE WORST JOB MARKET IN GENERATIONS. HE WAS UNEMPLOYED FOR NINE MONTHS. AFTER WORKING ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS SHE WENT INTO FORBEARANCE TWICE. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL SHE WAS SIX YEARS OUT OF COLLEGE BUT YOU COULD MAKE STEADY PAYMENTS. BETWEEN FORBEARANCE AND INTEREST RATES BETWEEN SIX AND 11% -- LOANS WILL LIKELY HANG OVER HER HEAD FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. SAMANTHA'S EXPERIENCES FAMILIAR. TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE EXPLOITED BY AN INDUSTRY NOT FOCUSED ON CONSUMER PROTECTION. BUT I'M THEIR FINANCIAL GROWTH. I'M HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIANS WITH DREAMS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. STARTING A BUSINESS. CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE HAD TO DEFER PARENTHOOD. AND LET BILLS FASTER SO THEY CAN PAY THEIR LOANS EACH MONTH. I'M HERE FOR THE VETERANS WHO RISK THEIR LIVES OVERSEAS AND NOW CAN'T AFFORD A DEGREE. SINGLE MOTHERS WHO WENT BACK TO COLLEGE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR KIDS. CAN'T GET AHEAD BECAUSE OF THE PAYMENTS. AND THE GRANDPARENTS TO COSIGN FOR THEIR GRANDCHILDREN'S LOANS. OR WENT BACK TO SCHOOL. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COHORTS OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. IN AMERICA HERE AMERICANS OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT FIGHT. IT'S A CUTE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE WHO AFFECTS EVERYONE. AND THAT'S WHY ATTORNEYS GENERAL. FROM RED AND BLUE STATES ALIKE HAVE FILED SO MANY LAWSUITS AGAINST PREDATORY LOAN SERVICING COMPANIES. AND IT'S OF STRAIGHT FORWARD CHOICE BETWEEN SIDING WITH THE BIG BANKS AND LOAN SERVICES. THE BROAD COALITION OF AB THREE SEVENTY SIX SUPPORTERS WHICH INCLUDE THE A A RP. THE STATE'S REALTORS LABOR UNIONS VETERANS YOUNG FARMERS TEACHERS CONSUMER ADVOCATES STUDENT GROUPS. AND THE THOUSANDS OF AFFECTED CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IN THE STATE. IT IS A CRISIS.

THREE SEVENTY SIX I DID ONE EIGHT KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED OF THE LEDGE COUNCIL VERSION OF THE AMENDMENTS THE CLIENT IS LOOKING AT THOSE -- SO WE WE ARE ABSORBING THEM THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY IS THAT SOME OF OUR MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE REYES HAVE NOT BEEN TO ADDRESS. THIS ONE INTO -- ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT I'M. SALSA IS A AND NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY MEMBERS. OF THAT OUR LOAN SERVICERS AND THE FEDERAL AND THE PRIVATE LAND MARKETS. OTHER MOSTLY NONPROFIT. THEIR STATE AGENCIES. OUR MEMBER SERVICE ABOUT 95% OF THE LOANS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THERE'S ONE POINT SIX TRILLION BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS OUT THERE SO WE SERVICE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION -- THIRDS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION. THE PRIVATE. LOANS THAT ARE THAT ARE LEFT TO STUDENTS. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. LOAN TERMS ARE SUCH BY THE LENDER. THEY ARE NOT SET BY US WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER INTEREST RATES. REPAYMENT OPTIONS BENEFITS LATE FEES THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT LOAN SERVICER CAN CONTROL OR OR IS ALLOWED TO CONTROL AND SO. ALL THESE FACTORS ARE SET BY CONGRESS. IT'S REALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL WHAT WE CAN CONTROL IS THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE GIVE IS ACCURATE. OF THAT IF WE MAKE MISTAKES THAT WE CORRECT MISTAKES -- THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST PROCESS IN PLACE TO DO SO -- AND THE REALITY IS THAT 85% OF OUR COMPLAINTS. ARE RESOLVED BY THE FIRST TELEPHONE CALL. AND THE REST CAN BE A BIT MORE COMPLEX SOME TAKE SOME TIME TO RESOLVE OF MOST OF THEM TAKE SEVEN OR LAST DAYS [inaudible] AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF AB THREE SEVENTY SIX WE APPRECIATE -- THE SUPPORTERS AND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITHOUT -- WE CERTAINLY ARE ARE AT WE HAVE. OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON CERTAIN CRITERIA IN THE BILL I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT [inaudible] I'M. BUT THE PROVISIONS COULD BE VERY COSTLY FOR US. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS MORE THAN HALF OF OUR MEMBERS ARE. SMALL BUSINESSES. SO SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN AB THREE SEVENTY SIX OF COULD REALLY. DAMAGE AND EVEN CLOSE THE DOORS SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE? OF FIRST OF ALL THE BILL PROVIDES WERE OF PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND OUR MEMBERS CAN BE SUED EVEN IF THE REGULATOR HAS FOUND NO FACTUAL BASIS FOR ACTION AGAINST THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS -- YOU'VE -- AND OUTLET CAM ACTUALLY TALK MORE ABOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE SHE'S. EXPERTEN NOT -- BUT WE DO HAVE THE CONCERN THAT THE COSTS OF LITIGATION. COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND THEREFORE THE COST OF THE STUDENT. BORROWERS -- SECOND MARKET MONITORING INITIATIVES IN THE BILL. OF THEY HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY OTHER REGULATORS. I'VE OF LEAVE IT AT THAT -- THEY ALSO CREATE SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN. ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER MEMBER. DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN INFORMATION IS REQUESTED AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT INFORMATION IT CAN BE DAUNTING OVER BURDENSOME AND ACTUALLY. COULD DOES PROVE A OF AN OVERLY HEAVY. WEIGHT. FOR THESE SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE WORD WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- SOME REFINEMENT. AND THOSE PROVISIONS. OF LAST LEASE PAYMENT APPLICATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS. I FROM THE TIME WE RECEIVE UNTIL THE TIME IT'S APPLIED TO THE BORROWERS LOANS. WE DO FEEL USE OF THE TERM BEST INTERESTS OF THE BORROWER IS VAGUE [inaudible] I AND WE'VE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE SPACE SPECIFYING. HIM APPLICATIONS. AND CONDITIONING LATE FEES -- BY STRIKING STRIKING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- TO ENSURE THE BORROWER WE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE BORROWER IS. CLEARLY INFORMED ACCURATELY INFORMED. ABOUT THE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY THE PAYMENT ALLOCATION AND GIVEN THE CHOICE. IF IT IS TO PAY OFF A SMALLER LOAN IN LIEU OF THE HIGHER INTEREST RATE LOANS JUST TO GET THAT LOAN DISPENSED WITH -- THAT IS A STRATEGY THAT SOME PEOPLE DO YOU PREFER TO USE -- AND WE WE DO FEEL THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT CHOICE [inaudible] I AGAIN I JUST WANTED. TO REMIND YOU THAT THE LATE FEES OTHER REFERENCE IN THE SECTION OF THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE LOAN. HOW THE LATE FEE AS TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN? AND OR A CAP ON LATE FEES WE DO NOT SET THE LATE FEES. WE DO NOT CHARGE LATE FEES. FOR THE SERVICE OR SERVERS FOR SERVICERS GET PAID A FLAT AMOUNT. IS A MINIMUS AMOUNT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. I'M SO WE'RE HOPING TO GET SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ADDRESSED -- WE FEEL THAT THERE'S COMPROMISE THERE -- WE DO NOT -- YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK AGAIN WITH THE CHAIR. MEDI MEMBERS I HAD TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND APPRECIATE BEING YOU HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. I CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA EVEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED PROVISION OUR CONCERNS PERTAIN ONLY TO CHAPTER THREE THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS NOT TO THAT SUBSTANTIVE REGULATION IN THE BILL. THE BILL ALLOWS ON AN INDIVIDUAL LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED -- PEOPLE WHICH CREATES A STATUTORY MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A POSSIBLE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR. PER VIOLATION THIS IS KIND OF A QUIZ I CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WITHOUT THE LIMITED PROTECTIONS THAT CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SO. THE JACK AND I'M NO FAN OF CALIFORNIA'S CLASS ACTION LAWS WE ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE THE MOST LIBERAL CLASS ACTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE FAR MORE LIBERAL THAN FEDERAL LAW. BUT WE DO HAVE RULES AROUND THEM AND YOU HAVE. TO THE CLASS HAS TO BE ASCERTAINABLE THEY HAVE TO HAVE COMMON ISSUES A LAWN FACT. THE NAMES PLAINTIFF HAS TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF PROBLEM THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CLASS HAVE. AND THE NAMES PLAINTIFF HAS TO ADEQUATELY REPRESENTS THE OTHER CLASS MEMBERS AND THEN FINALLY YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THAT THE CLASS. OF MEANS OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM IS BETTER THAN ANOTHER WAY OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM IN HERE FOR YOUR ALLOWING A LAWSUIT. BY A BAR OR ON BEHALF OF OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED YOU'RE KIND OF CREATING THIS HYBRID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WITHOUT THE EVEN MINIMAL STRUCTURES THAT ARE CLASS ACTION LAW REQUIRES AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THEM PLUS THE FIVE HUNDRED OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION. YOU MAY END UP WITH -- LAWSUITS THAT ARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN JUSTICE FOR THOSE REASONS THE JACK MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE COPPER THREE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU IN ADDITION WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DECENT LANE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED. ROBERT WILSON THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE OPPOSED. MY APOLOGIES AND FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE A LITTLE BIT LATE. MY APOLOGIES THANK YOU. IN ADDITION WITH THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. IN YOUR NINE BRING ABOUT WHAT COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE. MISS YOU STONE I WOULD JUST CURIOUS. ASKED. TO THE RIGHT TO CURE IT WAS ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED BRIEFLY IS THERE ANY. OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT ARE HOW DO YOU SEE. THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL AS STATED BY -- MISS VAN AUSTIN THE RIGHT TO CURE WE NEED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WELL BUT A RIGHT TO CURE PRIOR TO GOING TO PRY RIGHT ACTION IS YOURS. SO MY TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS SHE STATED THE USER THEY RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH THAN. ONE PHONE CALL SO BEFORE ONE WOULD BE DRAGGED INTO A LAWSUIT I MISSED YOUR IS IT. WELL POTENTIALLY. BY ME MOSTLY WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S ASKING IS THAT WE JUST STRUCK THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND I THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THEN I UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER. OF PEOPLE HERE. THE WHO ARE AFFECTED AND WE WE WOULD THEN WITHOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BE RELYING ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR EVEN THE WE'RE SETTING UP AN ADVOCACY OFFICE UNDER THIS BILL. THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE COMPLAINTS AND GIVEN AT THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT HAPPENED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD NECESSARILY SOLVE IT SO IF WE BUILT IN A STRUCTURE. THAT WAS A RIGHT TO CURE OR CHANGE THAT. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN THEN. IF THERE IS ILLEGAL ESPECIALLY PERPETUAL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE SETTING UP A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A KNOWING. ABUSE OF BARS WHICH WE SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THEY'RE CALLED ON OR UNTIL THERE'S A LAWSUIT FILED OR UNTIL AGAIN THE BORROWER WHO ARE OFTEN HAVE REALLY LESS INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW ALL OF THESE PIECES WORK THEN THE SERVICER DOES. THEIR LEAD TO DECISIONS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HARMFUL THOSE DECISIONS COULD BE. SO IF THERE IF WE BUILD IN A RIGHT TO CARRY AND IF WE'RE IF WE TAKE AWAY THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. I WORRY IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE THAT WE'RE SETTING UP BEHAVIORS BY THE SERVICES TO PROVEN TO BE. HARMFUL. THE BAR IS IN SO MANY INSTANCES THAT THAT WOULD YET PERPETUATE. THAT SITUATION WOULD FOR THEM SO I HAVE YET TO SEE A CONSTRUCT THAT REALLY WORKS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE BAR WAS IN IN THIS SITUATION. AND MOST OF THE WOOD NAVVY AT THE LARGEST SERVICERS BEING SUED IN I BELIEVE EVERY STATE THEY'RE OPERATING. SO THAT THEY CAN'T COME AS THEY TRIED THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE DID THE LICENSING SAY LOOK WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS DON'T INCLUDE US IN THIS THAN REALLY WAT THAT ASSOCIATIONS ASKING FOR IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE SO I I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO TALK TO FACT WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO TRY AND WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IN WAYS THAT THAT MAKES SENSE. WHAT I AM VERY LEERY OF DOING IS CREATING MORE ADMINISTRATIVE NIGHTMARE OR HEADACHE? FOR THE THE BAR WAS WHO GETTING DRAGGED AROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE TIME THAT THIS WORKS AGAINST THEM. INTEREST IS STILL GROWING AND THEY'RE ENDING UP PAYING MORE AND MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF THE PROCESSES [inaudible] SO. I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO TRY AND FIX THE BILL BUT THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS ABOUT WEAKENING PROTECTIONS FOR BORROWERS. GREAT I I JUST WANT. TO BE ON RECORD AND THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUE WORK BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION IF THERE YOU SEE A PATHWAY OF ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE I KNOW I AM ALWAYS A WE LOOKED AT IT AND WE COULDN'T COME UP WITH A REAL ONE WILL SOLUTION FOR THIS. I AT THIS TIME SO. SPORTING WE HAD A QUESTION -- CURRENTLY WE HAVE A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO JUDICIARY IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS MEASURE. SO MOVED MOVED BY SENATOR DORADOS CENTER ICE I MEAN SOMEONE STONE WHICH ELECT TO CLOSE. I JUST I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THE WORK THAT. YOU'VE ALL DONE WITH US OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS ON STUDENT ON THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL BILL THAT IS. UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT NATIONWIDE AND I'M HOPING CALIFORNIA DOES THE RIGHT THING I KNOW YOU'RE. THING AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HERE TODAY THANK YOU SENATE -- I'M NOT OVER MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WE HAVE TWO PASSENGER SHURI ON A. B. THREE SEVEN SIX PASSES AMENDED TO DO DO. SENATOR CENTER BRADFORD HI CHIANG -- CABALLERO. DOLLY -- ALSO. HUESO. SENATOR PORTANTINO [inaudible] THREE BELIEVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL. Q.. AND WE'RE MISSING IN OUR OTHER AUTHORS WILL WAIT SO. TAKE A BRIEF SUSPENSION AND COMMITTEE HERE ON A. B. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER TO BE YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB. EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN LET ME JUST START BY SAYING I KNOW FOR SOME THIS MIGHT BE A NEW IDEA -- BUT THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK IS MODELED AFTER VERY OLD CONCEPT AFTER THE PUBLIC BANK OF TOWARD THE CODA. WHICH THIS YEAR'S ENJOYED ITS HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF SUCCESS AS WELL AS PUBLIC BANKS IN OTHER COUNTRIES -- LET ME ALSO THE STATE THAT THIS IS A BILL. TO INCREASE LOCAL CONTROL OVER TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK -- IT DOESN'T CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK DIRECTLY IT ESTABLISHES A LIKELY LONG MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH MANY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. OUR BILL WOULD REQUIRE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE OF A CERTAIN SIZE BEFORE APPLYING FOR BANKING CHARTER. WE TO COMMITMENTS DURING THE PROCESS TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND REQUIRE SMALLER COUNTIES UNDER A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE TO FORM A GPA. IT WAS CRAFTED TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC BANK ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LAW AND BANKING LAW. AND ALL REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT PUBLIC BANKS KEEP THE SAME COLLATERAL GARMENTS AS PRIVATE BANKS. WE ACCEPTED A MINISTER IN THE PROCESS TO REQUIRE PUBLIC BANKS MAINTAIN FIFTY I. C. DEPOSIT INSURANCE. AND CONDUCT FEASIBILITY STUDIES IN A BUSINESS PLAN TO ANALYZE COST. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND LEGALITY ISSUES WHEN APPLYING FOR BANKING CHARTER. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE CRAFTED A BILL TO SUPPORT LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTE. BILL SPECIFICALLY ENCOURAGES PUBLIC BANKS WHERE POSSIBLE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS CREDIT UNIONS. AND COMMUNITY BANKS TO CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES WITH THOSE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS IS MODELED AFTER. THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WHICH HAS SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS FOR PROFITABLE RETURNS -- I WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THAT PROVIDE CLARIFICATION THAT A LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSITOR MAY CHOOSE TO DEPOSIT MORE MONEY INTO PUBLIC BANK THAN THE INITIAL SHAREHOLDER EQUITY PROVIDED THAT DDO APPROVE THE AGREEMENT. TECHNICAL MOMENTS THAT ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY IN TERMINOLOGY REGARDING RETAIL SERVICES. AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE -- THAT -- WE ARE COMMITTING -- AND I KNOW MY JOINT AUTHOR IS GOING TO BE COMING DOWN SHORTLY. TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WORKING ON AN AMENDMENT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE -- TO ALLOW VOTERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC BANK WITHOUT CONTRAVENING CHARTER CITY CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AD POWERS SO. AGAIN -- APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THIS COMMITTEE WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR SUBSTANTIAL. DE WORK ON THIS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT AND TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BRADFORD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS SUE SHE'LL JACOB AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE THE SPONSOR OF AB. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN OUR ALLIANCE REPRESENTS A DIVERSE COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS. FROM SAN DIEGO TO EUREKA. ARE ENDORSERS INCLUDE TWELVE CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES. INCLUDING THE FOUR LARGEST CITIES LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO. SAN JOSE AND SAN DIEGO. IN ADDITION WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY COMMUNITY LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENDORSERS. HOW TO COUNT AMONG THEIR SUPPORTERS BENEFICIAL STATE FOUNDATION WHICH IS THE ECONOMIC OWNER OF BENEFICIAL STATE BANK? I CAN A COMMUNITY BANK IN OAKLAND. AND THE COOPERATIVE CENTER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION. WHICH IS. A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD. AND CREDIT UNION IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA. OUR BILL AIMS TO ADDRESS THREE INTERCONNECTED PROBLEMS CITIES AND COUNTIES FACE A DIFFICULT CHOICE WHEN DECIDING WHERE TO BANK THEIR MONEY. WELL THE CONTRACT WITH MEGA BANKS THAT A VIOLATED THE LAW. AND AT THE CONSUMER PRODUCT PRACTICES OR WILL THEY FIND ALTERNATIVE SMALL BANKS THAT MAY BE TOO SMALL TO HANDLE THE COUNTY OR CITIES NEEDS. HOW DO WE BRING BACK CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL BANKS LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS HAVE SHRUNK SHRUNK TO A QUARTER OF THEIR FORMER SIZE? HAVING BEEN SQUEEZING DEPLETED BY MULTINATIONAL BANKS. AND HOW DO WE SOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE UNDER BANKED WHICH NATIONAL BANKS HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS SIGNIFICANT UNBANKED UNDER BANK POPULATIONS REPRESENTING OUR MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES OUT OF ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS STATE CALIFORNIA HAS AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND UNBANKED AND TWO MILLION UNDER BANK HOUSEHOLDS. THESE HOUSEHOLDS EITHER LACK A BANK ACCOUNT. OR HAVE ONE BUT STILL USE PREDATORY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHECK CASHING PAWN SHOPS. NON BANK MONEY ORDERS. SERVICES THAT SIPHON WEALTH FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC BANKING CAN ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP MODEL PUBLIC BANKS CAN WORK WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REACH THE UNBANKED AND UNDER BANKED OR PUBLIC BANKS CAN DIRECTLY REACH ON BANKED AND UNBANKED. COMMUNITIES. THEY CAN DO IT TOO PARTNERSHIP BY PROVIDING INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS IN THE LOS GUARANTEES TO LOCAL BANKS. PUBLIC BANKS CAN PROVIDE A NEW PARTNER LENDER FOR COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ONE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO STEAL THEIR CUSTOMERS OR PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS BUT WANTS THEM TO DRIVING GROW THE LOCAL ECONOMIES. AND PUBLIC BANKS CAN GIVE LOCALITIES MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR FINANCES FINANCING COSTS FOR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE POT. PROJECTS ARE OFTEN DOUBLED TO THE BOND MARKET OR WHAT BANK LENDING. USING A PUBLIC BANK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THESE COSTS BECAUSE PUBLIC BANKS CAN LEND AT MORE REASONABLE RATES WHILE RETURNING ALL THEIR INTEREST PAYMENTS BACK TO THE CITY OWNERS. THIS IS A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD. BY SETTING A UNIFORMED PAT FORDE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO FORM PUBLIC BANKS. AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANOTHER TOOL TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN BOTTOM LINES FOR THEIR RESIDENTS AND FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR BILLING WE ARCHER I VOTE. IN ADDITION WHAT IS. YOUR TO SOMEONE. YOU MY NAME IS ANA HAS CELL RESIDE IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M NO INVOLVED IN SOCIAL ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS MOSTLY IN THE COMING TO LEVEL. THEM AND I USED TO BE ON THE EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF ONE OF THE MAJOR BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BASED ON THAT INSPECT A SPIN THAT MAKES THE COMING OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU OF MAINLY FOR THREE REASONS. NUMBER ONE PUBLIC BANKS CAN DO AKON COMPLEMENT EXISTING INSTITUTIONS BY DOING ADDITIONAL UNDERWRITING. IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST I'VE COME TO THE MEETING VERY WELL A MANY WELL MEANING PEOPLE IN THE BANKING WORLD TWELVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN MIND BUT WE HAVE TO REALIZE THE STILL BOUND BY THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. AND THE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE HAVE ACTUALLY OF OF AN EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND HOUSING IN. THE END THE LOCAL -- MONKMAN CEPEDA KEYS AND THEIR X.. LATER THIS THAT THEM OFF FROM THE CITY OR THE COUNTY HAS TO BEAR THE TREASURE AND IT'S CONFIDENCE. SO WE I THINK THAT. TO OF FANS CAN DO A MORE HOLISTIC UNDERWRITING DECISION AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BANKS A POLL REALLY OPPOSED. TO THE BILL AS IT IS COMING FROM A A SHELTER PERSPECTIVES THIS IS A NEW ENTRANTS INTO THAT MARKET BASE BUT AFTER THE FIRM BELIEF THAT THIS IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME. THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT THE PUBLIC BANK WILL IN KOREA AND LOCALLY WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ALSO FOR THE BANKS. SECONDLY I THINK THAT COMING INTO UNDERWRITING ALSO ON UNLOCKS DORMANT OPPORTUNITIES SO WHEN I WAS AT THE BANK WE HAD ANOTHER MILLION. A MILLION CONSUMER HOUSEHOLDS FIFTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES -- LINDOS -- I WISH A POROUS AND AND I WISH WE HAD COMMUNITY INTELLIGENCE AVAILABLE FOR ALL UNDERWRITING IT WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE FUTURE OF POLITICAL INTENTIONS AND PRIORITIES. IN IN THE COMMUNITIES SO THAT YOU COULD MAKE PLANNING DECISIONS. LOOKING OUT A AND FUTURE MOST TO IT LIFECYCLE SCORES AND LOOKING BACK AT FINANCIAL STATEMENT THIS. IS STILL TRUE TODAY THIS IS NOT A FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT WHICH ALSO [inaudible] ACT HEAVILY.

AND SAID IT WAS AT BEFORE AND JUST BECAUSE THIS BILL PASSES NOT A SINGLE.

I JUST WANT A QUICK MINUTE JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE THIS IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA THE IDEA THAT THE FACT THAT THE BANK. THAT THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA HAS ONE IT JUST KIND OF SHOWS THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING RADICAL HERE. AND I WANT TO DEMYSTIFY THE MYTH THAT PEOPLE IN PROFIT ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WHAT PUBLIC BANKS DO IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT PROFIT PEOPLE AREN'T ACTUALLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHICH PEOPLE ARE GETTING THAT PROFIT AND WHAT WE SEE THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN BIG BANKS BEING A MECHANISM TO FUNNEL PROFIT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO. THANK GREAT IT TO THE TOP 1% SO I URGE AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHARLIE SHAMUS AMIR WITH EVER TO SCHOOL RISING REPRESENTING THE CHINESE PROGRESS ASSOCIATION SOUTH OF MARKET COMMITTEE ACTION NETWORK.

EUREKA TO SAN DIEGO. THE ALLIANCE FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SENIOR NINE WITNESSES OPPOSITION YOU READY. AFTER MR TURN MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS. I WE DON'T QUARREL WITH THE THE GOAL IN THE MISSION OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND WE WE THINK THAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD. WHAT THE TERMS ARE TAX COLLECTORS WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO THIS BODY IS THAT? THE ASSUMPTION THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS. UNDER THE CONTROL OF COUNTY CHARGERS COULD BE DEPOSITED IN THESE BANKS IS IS FALSELY CANNOT CONCENTRATE. THE POOL DOLLARS IN ONE PLACE LIKE A PUBLIC BANK I WE TOOK THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF ESTABLISHING A PREEMPTIVE POLICY ON THIS IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WE DID SHARE. WITH THE PROPONENTS PRIOR TO THEM -- SECURING AN AUTHOR THE GOAL THE AMENDMENT TO TAKE INSTEAD OF VERY HIGH BAR SO IT WOULDN'T BE SORT OF A **** NILLY SET UP. BUT WE DO THINK THAT I WOULD BE VERY VERY UNLIKELY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY YIELD ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BANK YOU SONG THEN ALICE'S WHICH IS ACTUALLY. THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY COUNTY LAND TO SET UP A BANKING CASH FLOW FOR THAT MANY YEARS AND STILL PAY ALL THE REGULAR BILLS THE COUNTIES HAVE TO PAY. I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOBBYIST OF COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON A LOT OF MONEY THAT ATTRACTS YOUR ATTENTION VERY QUICKLY. AND THE LEGISLATURE LIKES TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT COUNTIES HAVE SO MUCH MONEY IF THAT EVER HAPPENS. AND SO WE WENT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO CASH FLOW A BANK AND SO TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE IN STATUTE THERE'S A TECHNICALLY MECHANISM TO GO TRAIN ESTABLISHED IT WILL PUT AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON COUNTY TREASURER'S THAT REALLY WOULDN'T EVER BE ABLE TO PUT. THAT MUCH OF THEIR MONEY IN ONE THING THE KEY TO PUBLIC INVESTMENT IS THE SPREAD OF RISK AND TO PUT ALL OF THE COUNTY'S MONEY WHICH IS ALSO THE SCHOOL MONEY. IN ONE ACCOUNT IS IS VERY CONCERNING SO WE'RE JUST. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE GOING INTO THIS WITH VERY WIDE OPEN EYES ABOUT WHAT COUNTIES CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. ON AND FURTHER THE STUDIES THAT HAVE COME BACK HAVE SHOWN THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO THE COMPLIANCE THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR BANK. I IN LINE WITH ALL OF THE LAWS FEDERAL AND STATE IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING AND THE STUDY ITSELF COSTS MONEY AND A LOT OF TIME AT THE STAFF LEVEL SO WERE. ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESSURE TO SPEND THE PUBLIC'S MONEY ON A STUDY THAT WE'RE PRETTY SURE WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF BUT WE MAY END UP BEING PRESSURED TO DO THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS ARE VERY COMMITTED VERY PASSIONATE FOLKS AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS FOR AWHILE. SO WE'RE JUST CONCERNED THAT WAS THIS IS SETTING UP SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER LEAD TO ANYTHING BILL CREATE FALSE HOPE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR AN ABOUT FACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON JASON LANE WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE WE'VE. HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS ULTIMATELY WE MEAN REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO TE MEASURE THERE ISN'T A SINGLE FEASIBILITY STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE IN ANY CITY IN ANY STATE -- THAT SHOWS THAT A PUBLIC BANK CAN BE SUCCESSFUL THAT WON'T HAVE LOSSES -- SAN FRANCISCO HAS. FEASIBILITY STUDY THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED PAGES LONG IT HAS FOUR MODELS ALL FOUR RESULT IN LOSSES ONE DOESN'T MAKE MONEY FOR FIFTY FOUR YEARS -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW TRYING TO IMPORT AND IDEA FROM NORTH DAKOTA I DON'T EVER RECALL THAT HAPPENING BEFORE -- BUT IN THE CASE OF THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA IT LOST MONEY FOR TWELVE YEARS -- AND IT WAS FORMED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ITS GDP IS LITERALLY THE SIZE OF OXNARD -- IT'S 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S GDP SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON. WE ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY ABOUT SOME OF THE DIALOGUE IS TAKING PLACE TODAY IN OTHER COMMITTEES ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BANKS. AND THAT IT WILL COMPETE THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY FALLS. THE PREMISE. OF A PUBLIC BANK THE ONLY WAY IT OPERATES AND WORKS IS IF IT STRIPS. DEPOSITS OUT OF PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. AND THE RHETORIC AROUND WALL STREET I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT THE REALITY IS WALL STREET BANKS ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF DEPOSITS BEING TAKEN OUT OF PRIVATE ENTITIES. IT IS COMMUNITY BANKS STATE CHARTERED INSTITUTIONS. THAT WILL MOST ACUTELY FEEL THE EFFECTS OF HAVING DEPOSITS TAKEN AWAY FROM. COMMUNITY BANKS WHO DO GOOD SOME PRETTY PHENOMENAL STUFF IN THEIR COMMUNITIES RELY ON PUBLIC AGENCY DEPOSITS AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO THE CAN GO BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE LOANS. THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY PROPOSES TO TAKE THOSE DEPOSITS AWAY. THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT MIND COMPETITION WE WILL COMMIT. IT IS WHEN THAT COMPETITION IS UNFAIR AND DONE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THAT GIVES US PAUSE IN THIS SITUATION. WE ARE CREATING IN THIS BILL A CORPORATE ENTITY THAT CORPORATE ENTITY IS GOING TO ESCAPE TAXATION THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT POINT 8% BANKS IN THE STATE PAY TEN POINT INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE THEIR DEPOSITS AND GIVE THEM TO AN ENTITY THAT WILL PAY NO INCOME TAXES. I'VE HEARD THE AUTHOR STAY. IN RETORT TO THAT ARGUMENT THE CREDIT UNIONS DON'T PAY INCOME TAXES BUT THE REALITY IS THE IRIS STREET CREDIT UNIONS THE WAY THEY DO FOR ONE SPECIFIC REASON. IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL WRITTEN AND FORCE COMMON BOND REQUIREMENT FOR ITS MEMBERS TYPICALLY INCLUDING EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES BUSINESSES -- AND MEMBERS ASSOCIATED IN A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IN AB FIFTY SEVEN ANYONE CAN WALK IN THE STREET AND USE A PUBLIC BANK SO THE ARGUMENT. RELATIVES TAXATION CREDIT UNION SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY. WE ARE TO KNOW VOTE ON WHAT THE LA TIMES CALLS A MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MARGARET GLAD SHE NUMBER HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORKED WE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT AND TAKING AWAY DEPOSITS FROM LOCAL. COMMUNITY BANKS THAT ARE REINVESTING IN THE COMMUNITIES -- UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN TRYING TO MAKE BOTH THE BANK PARTNERSHIP WORK BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK THIS BILL DOES NOT GET THERE. AND WE'RE NOT WE DON'T THINK THE COMMUNITY THEY PUBLIC BANKING MODEL WILL BE ABLE TO GET THERE WITHOUT HARMING OUR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE PASSED. THANK YOU. ROBERT WILSON THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE OF OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ELLERY NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION WE ARE. EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT THE LOSS OF COMMUNITY BANKS WERE MOST. SMALL BUSINESSES DO THEIR BUSINESS. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OUR BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SENATOR DORADO. YES I I THINK THOSE ARE. SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S A RESPONSE SURE SOME OF THEM. BUT AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER. SURE I OF THEIR NUMBER VICIOUS ARRAYS ON THE TRY TO GO THROUGH A FEW OF THEM SO -- THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO STUDY HOW THIS COULD BE DONE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND I AB TOLD THE PUBLIC REPEATEDLY ABOUT THIS BILL -- THAT THE RISK WITH THIS BILL IS NOT THAT WE CREATE A LOT OF PUBLIC BANKS THE RISK OF THIS BILL. IS WE'VE ESTABLISHED SO MANY REQUIREMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT -- WE'RE NOT CREATING -- ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR PUBLIC BANKS -- THAT THE RISK IS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO FALL APART A PUBLIC BANK THAT A JURISDICTION WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY IN CHARTER PUBLIC BANK THAT'S REAL. THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE MANY ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT IN GREATER DETAIL IF THAT'S OF INTEREST. SO THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO AROUND CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS. THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. EXPLICITLY STATED A POLICY TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS SO THE IDEA WAS CRITICALLY IN THE RETAIL SERVICES AREA -- FOR THE PUBLIC AND TO BE A A A BANKS BANK. I THAT WHERE POSSIBLE -- RETAIL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY THOSE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND THAT IS THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL. WE HAVE ASKED THE CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER FOR GOOD MEETINGS WITH THEM. IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS ON LANGUAGE TO ENSURE FOLKS THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO DO. OPEN TO THAT BECAUSE THE THE THE THOSE OF US WERE ADVOCATES FOR PUBLIC BANKS WE HAVE NO INTENT OR NO DESIRE TO UNDERCUT. CREDIT UNIONS FOR COMMUNITY BANKS BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS. THEY HAVE BY VIRTUE OF THEIR PRACTICES OVER THE YEARS -- BEEN ABLE TO SWALLOW MANY THIS COMMUNITY BANKS IN FACT -- SINCE TWENTY PLUS YEARS AGO WE USED TO HAVE -- THREE TIMES AS MANY COMMUNITY BANKS AS WE DO TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT WALL STREET PRACTICES HAVE HAVE ENGAGE AND SO ARE. PROFOUND HOPE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT PUBLIC BANKS WILL BE COMPLEMENTARY TO COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS AND BE ABLE TO TO MOVE THAT FORWARD -- WANT TO SEE IF THERE ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS AT THIS POINT THOSE ARE A FEW POINTS THAT THAT WERE RAISED. YEAH THEY ALL OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE THEIR WHAT. CAN. YOU DO THAT AND I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE [inaudible] SIGNIFICANT. THE WAY THAT HE COULD ARE TREATED. ADDITIONAL BANKS AND THAT ALWAYS [inaudible] ONE THE HEIGHT OF THERE WAS THERE ARE DOWN LOW INCOME WORKERS. I MEAN THE COLOR. WE HAVE BEEN. AS FAR AS PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED. AND THAT CERTAINLY IS A BIG DETRIMENT TO EVERYBODY IT'S OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HURT BY NOT HAVING THE THE BANKING SERVICES -- ONE COM I SEE HERE IN TERMS OF THE THE CHAMBERS OPPOSITION THAT. A WE WOULD JEOPARDIZE TAXPAYER FUNDS AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTMENTS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT -- EXCEPT THAT ON THE ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM ARE VERY REAL VERY REAL AS FAR AS WORKING PEOPLE OUR NEEDS OUR NEEDS -- TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL OUR NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO LOANS -- AND THEY'RE VIRTUALLY ALL THE TRADITIONAL BANKS ARE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT IN MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY SO -- AND THE I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE FULLY REPLACED BY JUSTIN ONLINE. OF SERVICES SO -- I AGAIN I THINK THAT. THE THE CONCEPT AS YOU'RE SAYING. IS A GOOD ONE OF THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AS FAR AS REALLY MOVING IT FORWARD AND I I THINK WE OUGHT TO MOVE FORWARD WE ARE USING TOO MUCH BY NOT HAVING. BANKS THAT REALLY. TAKE THE COMMUNITY INTO ACCOUNT PRIMARILY. AND I DON'T MEAN AT THE RISK OF LOSING. OF FINANCIALLY. THANK YOU AND IF I CAN RESPOND TO TO ONE PART OF THAT -- THE THE CHAMBER REFERENCE POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZING TAXPAYER FUNDS AND HOW. BANKS ADDRESS COMMUNITIES -- IN AS IF YOU PUT IT. THE THE THRUST OF WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IS -- WHAT I THINK MANY IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE HAS BEEN THE FAILURE AND I REFER TO THIS AS THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS -- THE THE THE LOBBYIST FOR THE COMPANY BANKING ASSOCIATION IS MENTIONED. WHAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF? THE RHETORIC FROM THE BANKING INDUSTRY VIS A. B. R. BILL BECAUSE INITIALLY WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY DOES MEET THE PUBLIC'S NAY. AND AS YOU HAVE JUST WELL ARTICULATED -- IT I THINK IF YOU ASK MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THEY WOULD NOT SAY THAT THE WALL STREET BANKS ARE SERVING THE PUBLIC -- WHETHER BE CONSUMERS FOR EXPERIENCING PREDATORY LENDING WHO HAD MILLIONS OF BANK ACCOUNTS OPEN UP IN THEIR NAMES OF LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS. HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY GREED LENDERS SMALL BUSINESSES DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL. FOR THE PUBLIC WHO'S DOLLARS OUR DOLLARS ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING INVESTED AGAINST OUR VALUES AND FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES GUN MANUFACTURERS PRIVATE PRISONS OR COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE NEED TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE BUT THAT BEING SAID I WANTED JUST A CLOSE WITH THE THE CHAMBER. HAS TAKEN THIS BILL OFF OF ITS INITIAL JOB KILL LIST BECAUSE WE HAVE PLACE SO MANY REQUIREMENTS. ON WHAT IT TAKES FOR A LOCAL JURISDICTION GET CHARTER THAT I THINK -- THERE MANY WHO THINK THAT THIS MAY NOT HAPPEN AND THAT MAY BE TRUE -- BUT WE WANT TO BE AS FISCALLY PRUDENT POSSIBLE WHICH IS WHY WE'VE AGREED TO ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THIS EXPERIMENT IT'S TO THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST BE BRIEF AND NOT MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR A WHILE AND COURSON LISTED. IN THE ON THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL ANALYSIS GOING BACK -- TO TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN. I TRY -- TO PUSH FOR THE ABILITY TO CREATE A STATE BANK AND IT WAS LIMITED TO A TASK FORCE. ESTABLISHING A BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE OF SORTS TO ANALYZE AVAILABILITY OF CRANE A BANK AND THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO EVEN STUDY THE ISSUE [inaudible] AND I WHAT'S WRONG WITH STUDY AN ISSUE WHAT'S WRONG WITH LOOKING OF THE VIABILITY IN OF COURSE OTHERS A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO THIS CONCEPT. AND I AND I UNDERSTAND WHY BUT AGAIN I I ALSO SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WHEN WE WHEN IT'S TIME FOR US TO PROVE OUR OUR AGREEMENT AND BACK THEN IT -- THE THE THE SERVICE PROVIDER WAS BANK OF AMERICA AND WE WERE THERE'S AND WE ASK SO WE WE ASKED -- ASKED HIM POINT BLANK AT IN IN A SETTING SUCH AS THIS IS SOMEBODY'S GONNA DO TO REINVEST OUR COMMUNITY AND SAID NOTHING NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS. AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS WERE GIVEN YOUR DEPOSITS HERE THIS IS A CITY WITH TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEPOSIT THAT HELPS YOU. THEY SAID YOU WERE DOING YOUR FAVOR. THIS REALLY DOESN'T HELP US A NEW ANY WHICH WAY WE'RE PROVIDING YOU A SERVICE AND WE'RE GIVING YOU A VERY COMPETITIVE RATE. AND THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A GREAT DEAL WE'RE GETTING. AND I NEVER FORGOT THAT. I NEVER FORGOT THAT AND THROUGH THE YEARS BEEN RAISED IN A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD BEING RAISED IN A PLACE WHERE BUSINESSES. DIDN'T GET BANK LOANS AND AND THERE ARE THERE ARE SPECIFIC PLACES WERE BANKS JUST GENERALLY. IN THE PAST AND AND IN MANY CASES TODAY DON'T LAN. AND OUT OF THE LOOP AND AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS. TEN A A ASKED FOR A BANK LOAN GETS IT AND WE ONLY 10% 90% ARE DENIED AND WHAT WHEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IF YOU'RE RICH. YOU GET A LOW INTEREST RATE. NO COLLATERAL NEEDED. NO PROBLEM GETTING ALONE AUTOMATIC APPROVAL BUT IF YOU'RE POOR. COLLATERAL [inaudible] THE NILE. WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT LED. WE WE NEED TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER. AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO GET BANKS TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND DO I FEEL THE BANKS ARE MAKING GOOD EFFORTS I DO. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING -- I THINK -- THEY ARE MANY CASES THERE ARE WORKING ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS AND A AND I'M NOT HERE TO JUST BE CRITICAL IN SAY. BANKS ARE FAILING AT EVERY LEVEL BECAUSE I FEEL. BANKS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB IN CREATING NICHES AND AND AND REACHING OUT AND FINDING ALL EVERY NOW AND THEN. YOU KNOW -- Là I REMEMBER THE THE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT WAS -- USED TO BE A FORMER BANK OF AMERICA EXECUTIVES SAID. THAT YOU KNOW ONE YEAR WE DEVELOPED A A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR UND FOR SPECIFICALLY LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I SAID YEAH WELL ONE YEAR. WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT EVERY YEAR? AND WHAT I CAN NOT ONLY BE A ONE TIME PILOT PROGRAM IN HIS RESPONSE WAS YOU KNOW WE FOUND. IN THAT EFFORT THAT THE DEFAULT RATES DID NOT INCREASE. THEY ACTUALLY LOWERED. WELL WELL INTO UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DEFAULT RATES WENT DOWN. AS TO THE WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME. I HAVE AND I THINK THIS IS JUST A OFF ON THAT PRINCIPLE IF IF CITIES CAN'T DO THAT THEY PROBABLY WON'T. BUT THEY WON'T BE DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THE BANKERS ARE DOING NOW AND THAT'S EXCEPT THE IN. A TAXPAYER DEPOSITS RIGHT NOW BANKS EXCEPT TAX PER DEPOSITS THAT'S THE CONCEPT WE DEPOSIT. AND AND MAY BE FOR ME. IF IF IF WE USE THIS AS A MECHANISM MAYBE BANKS WILL COME TO THE CITY'S LATER ON SO WE WILL INVEST. IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE WILL PROVIDE LOANS TO THE UNDERSERVED. AND WE CAN DO IT BETTER THAN YOU. AT AND MAYBE WE NEED TO ANSWER INJECT A LITTLE BIT OF COMPETITION IN THIS PROCESS AND AND I BELIEVE I I'M WHAT THE BANKERS IT SHOULD BE A FAIR PROCESS. THE THE MUNICIPAL BANKS IF THEY ARE CREATED THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY -- OTHER TOOL THE BANKS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE BANKS I AGREE WITH THEM THERE BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK OTHERWISE BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THIS COULD BE A TREMENDOUS TOOL HELPING A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY AND I I BELIEVE IT'LL WORK. A AND FOR THE ONE SAID -- CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN THEY PROBABLY WON'T BUT AT LEAST THEY WILL HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOCAL BANKING COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WHAT SO IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HI MOM I WILL ALSO ADD MAYON THOUGHT TO THIS ISSUE I WANT TO FIRST COMMEND BOTH AUTHORS BECAUSE THIS IS A HERCULEAN. TASK TO MOVE THIS MEASURE FORD IT'S A CONCEPT I THINK IT'S TIME IS LONG OVERDUE -- I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AS IN THIS NOT TO BEAT UP THE BANKS AT ALL BUT TWO THINGS YOU WILL NOT FIND. AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PHARMACIES AND BANKS. AND IT'S REALITY YOU WILL NOT FIND A PHARMACY OR BANK IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY SO IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO LOCATE ONE THERE THEN IF YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY AND MAKE. A MUNICIPALITY IS WILLING TO INVEST THEIR MONEY THERE AND YES THERE'S REST AND I TO HAVE BEEN A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL AND I DO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. ON LOCAL JURISDICTION OVER STANDING THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE I COME FROM THE CITY OF GUARDINO WERE WE ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT AND NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE WE STARTED A MUNICIPAL INSURANCE CORPORATION. AND SOUL I'VE SHARED MY BIT OF CAUTION TO BOTH AUTHORS AS TO WHY SOME OF THE I'M IMAGE THAT WE ASK FOR TO KIND OF SAFEGUARD AND MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITY HOUSING VOICE AND THE CITY AND THOSE. BUT TO STAY HERE THE OPPOSITION AND CONTINUES TO SAY BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK THEN WHY THE OPPOSITION. I A IT SEEMS LIKE MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THAT. IT WILL NOT WORK SO [inaudible] LET IT. HI I MEAN I I DON'T THINK WHY WOULD WE NOT LEAST. LET IT SEE IF IT COULD FLY OR NOT BUT I THINK IT'S A CONCEPT IT'S LONG OVERDUE -- I I THINK THERE IS A NEED AND I TALKED TO SOMEONE DURING THIS ISSUE AND IF SOMEONE WHO WALKED INTO A BANK I WILL NOT IDENTIFY THAT BANK BUT THEY HAVE REPRESENTATIVES HERE. AND THEY WALKED IN TO GET CHANGE FOR A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. AND THEY WERE DENIED CHANGE FOR A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT AT THAT BANK. IF BANKS CAN MAKE CHANGE. I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M REALLY LOS THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A BANK. ALWAYS DID AS A KID WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND IT AND IF IT WAS YOUR COMMUNITY BANK. YOU WITH EXPECT THAT SO I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS CONCEPT AND I'M WILLING -- TO SUPPORTED AS IT MOVES FORWARD -- YES IT'S A LOT OF WORK IN THIS DOUBLES IN THE DETAILS BUT I I THINK -- IT IS THE TIME HAS COME SO ON THAT NOTE -- ASSN IMAGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT MEATY TOPIC APPRECIATE IT I WANT TO THANK CENTER QUITE SO FOR YOUR YOU LEAVE YOUR YEARS OF LEADERSHIP I HAVE TO ADMIT -- WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT YOUR ATTEMPTS EIGHT YEARS AGO I ALMOST THOUGHT OF NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE I KNEW HOW HARD IT WAS BUT? IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO OUR THANK THE CHAIRMAN YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AS WELL -- AND TO JUST ECHO WHAT YOU JUST SAID. IF WE HAVE SET UP THE RULES TO MAKE IT. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CHARTER BANK WHY NOT ATTEMPTED I DO BELIEVE THAT IF A LOCAL JURISDICTION IS SUCCESSFUL AT JUMPING OVER ALL THOSE HURDLES IN MEETING THOSE CHALLENGES. THE PUBLIC BANK THAT IS CHARTER WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT IS OUR HOPE BUT THE SECOND THING I WILL SAY IS. MY HOPE IS THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WILL NOT SHOULD THE INDUSTRY TO SERVE THE PUBLIC BETTER AT THE LEAST WE ARE HOPEFUL OF THAT -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET MUCH EVIDENCE THAT IT HAS BUT AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION IS IS IS IS ALLOWING US TO HAVE AN HONEST. DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR BANKS AND AN INDUSTRY TO SERVE THE PUBLIC AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SYSTEMS ON I WOULD JUST ECHO IN RESPECTFULLY ASK -- FOR MISTER CHAIR AS I BILL AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SIGNATURE THANK YOU.
