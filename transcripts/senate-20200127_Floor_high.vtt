WHICH IS NOT. A LIGHT AND

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.172
FANTASTIC SCHOOL FIELD TRIP.

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:50.842
IT'S A FIELD TRIP THAT WOULD BE

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:52.677
IT'S A FIELD TRIP THAT I

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.845
BELIEVE WHAT FEEL CHIP SHOULD

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:56.214
BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:59.717

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:03.154
SCHOOL TEX LEARNINGS TO

COMMUNITY BASED EXPERIENCE A

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:06.924
LEARNING. AND SO I AM HOPING

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:08.960
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:10.895
SURE THAT AS A STATE THAT WE

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:13.464
CONTINUE TO FUND SPACES AND

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:15.333
PLACES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.602
CONTINUE TO BE REMINDED OF

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.872
HISTORY ON BOTH THE GOOD AND

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:22.507
THE PAINFUL BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.076
MAKE KNOW OUR HISTORY. WE ARE

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:27.011
SUBJECT TO MAKE THOSE STEAKS

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:30.381
AND SO WE AS OTHER GUARDIANS IN

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.115
SO MANY WAYS HAVE A

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:32.550
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE CAN'T

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.585
FAULT THEM FOR NOT KNOWING IF

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.421

SENATOR MITCHELL JACKSON. I'D

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.095
LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IN THERE FOR

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:46.497
A MOMENT BECAUSE- I'M OFTEN

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:48.266
STRUCK BY A STORY THAT I

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:51.569
LEARNED. WHEN AUSCHWITZ WAS IT

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.272
JUST BEFORE WAS LIBERATED THE-

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.873
THIRD REICH DECIDED THAT THEY

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.777
WERE GOING TO TRY TO WALK THOSE

00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:01.245
WHO HAD SURVIVED ON A DEATH

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:04.649
MARCH. THEY TOOK FIFTY SIX

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.184
THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.785
MARCHED THEM THROUGH POLAND.

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.287
HOPING THAT THEY WOULD DIE

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:10.521
ALONG THE WAY SO THAT THEY

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.857
WOULD NOT BE. THE VOICE OF

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.660
HISTORY WHEN THE THIRD REICH

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:18.496
ENDED. AN I REMEMBER A STORY

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.465
THAT I HEARD AND AGAIN WE ARE

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.266
LOSING THOSE WHO WERE THE

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:26.637
VICTIMS THEY'RE DYING. THE OLD-

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.106
AND AS A RESULT WE HEAR YOU

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.507
YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:33.344
DENY THE HOLOCAUST EXISTED. NOW

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.546
REPLACING THAT VOICE WITH THE

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.849
VOICE OF THE NILE WITH THE

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.951
VOICE OF HATRED. WITH THE VOICE

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.853
OF DE HUMANIZATION BECAUSE THE

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.588
ONLY WAY WE CAN KILL EACH OTHER

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:46.457
IS IF WE DE HUMANIZE THE ENEMY.

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.059
THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THEY DON'T

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.761
HAVE CHILDREN THEY AREN'T

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.129
SOMEONE'S CHILDREN THEY ARE TO

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:54.766
BROTHER A MOTHER OR FATHER. BUT

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.033
THIS STORY. BURKE WITH ME IS

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.735
STUCK WITH ME FOR YEARS IT'S A

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.971
STORY OF A YOUNG OF A WOMAN WAS

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.939
A YOUNG GIRL. I WAS BEING TAKEN

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:05.843
OFF TO. THE CAMPS AND HER

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.011
FATHER WHO WAS BEING SEPARATED

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:08.880
FROM HER SAID SOMETHING TO

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:10.248
WHERE HE SAID NO MATTER WHAT

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:13.451
HAPPENS. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:18.990
YOUR SHOES. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:22.126
YOUR SHOES. SHE WAS ONE OF

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:24.028
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WAS MARCHED.

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.530
ON THE DEATH MARCH AT THE END

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:28.332
OF WORLD WAR TWO IT WAS THE

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.435
FACT THAT SHE HAD CHOOSE. THE

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.738
KEPT HER ALIVE. BECAUSE OTHERS

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.773
WHO WALK THAT WALK WERE

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.543
BAREFOOTED OR WHO SHOES DID NOT

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:41.112
SURVIVE AND THEY THEN BECAME

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.582
SICK AND DIED OF FROSTBITE OR

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:46.784
THEY WERE SHOCKED. BUT IT'S A

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.453
STORY ABOUT A DAD TELLING HIS

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:59.530
WHY WE MUST REMEMBER. BECAUSE

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:02.300
EVERY CHILD EVERY PERSON. NEEDS

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:05.336

HISTORY OR EXPERIENCE ABOUT IT.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.531

TO AVOID WILDFIRES BLACKOUTS

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.797

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.463
ACCOUNTABLE BUT WE- TO LOOK AT

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:45.065
THE BRIGHT PIT- OF. THE NO

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:45.999
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:46.600
ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE THIS

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.435
YEAR SPECIFICALLY AROUND OUR

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:50.904
LARGE UTILITY HOLDERS. AND%

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.706
THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING.

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:54.308
YOU KNOW THESE WILDFIRES AS MY

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.777
COLLEAGUE SAID RE. SUBSTANTIAL

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.313
AND CREATE- DEATH IN SOME CASES

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:03.784
IN FULL LOSING EVERYTHING. IF

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:04.384
THESE UTILITIES ARE GONNA BE

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:06.253
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE AT.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.224
AND THEN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:13.760
TWELVE FOR ME THE GAME DâN.

01:42:13.827 --> 01:42:21.335
THAT WORD FROM S. WHILE. I

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.803
THINK THERE HAVE A GIVE. WE

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.371
THOUGHT WHAT'S GOOD BURKE ASIDE.

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:25.005
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S-

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:26.206
TO THAT WE ELIMINATE MASSIVE.

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:27.307
HERE'S MY SAG AND YOU GET A

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.442
LINE BREAKAGE THAT CREATE. A

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.142
SOME OF THE WILDFIRES. BUT WE

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.710
ALL HAVE TO LOOK AT VEGETA

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:30.344
MANAGE AND A LOT OF THINGS. THE

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.812
NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER AND

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.514
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT NEED TO

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.648
TAKE PLACE IN ORDER THAT WE

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.216
HAVE SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY.

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.851
THAT GOES AND WE DON'T END UP

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.286
LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY I

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.687
MEAN WE'RE CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.322
TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY IN IN

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:43.957
TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE'VE GOT TO

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.559
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VIABLE

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.327
SOLUTION FOR POWER MOVING

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:48.829
FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT WE

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:52.599
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOLDING

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.701
THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN ONE PLACE

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:58.639
BUT NOT ALLOWED TO EXT EYES AT.

01:42:58.705 --> 01:43:02.042
THE IN S. IT IS TO BE CALM. ON

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.043
THE MINUTES. YOUR BILL DAY BUT

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.511
I WANT YOU TO REALLY FOCUS ON.

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:05.045
ARE TURNING IN THE CAUCUS

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:05.712
BASICALLY THE REASON SALUTE YOU

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.080
KNOW THE RE. LANGUAGE THAT'S

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:08.949
WHAT'S REASONABLE. NO THE

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.350
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:11.685
WHAT REASONABLE IS SO WE SHOULD

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:13.487
DEFINITELY. HONE DOWN THAT

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:14.688
LANGUAGE WHEN YOU GET IT OUT OF

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:15.989
THIS FLOOR AND MOVE OVER TO THE

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:17.691
ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE I REALIZE

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:19.693
THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.061
AND I HAVE A LOT OF ANGRY

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:22.663
CONSTITUENTS AS WELL. BUT THE

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:24.364
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. LIKE I

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:26.233
SAID. YOU KNOW WERE IT'S ALMOST

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.670
AS IF WE'RE REQUIRING SOMEBODY

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.905
TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT GIVING

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:34.074
THEM THE ABILITY TO DO. IN

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:37.444
ORDER TO. IMPACT THE KEY ISSUE

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.513
IS WE SET. ASK YOU TO WORK AT

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.381

THAT I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:49.323
TODAY AND REASON I ONE OF THE

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:49.957
OFFICE I THINK THAT. THE FOCUS

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.558
OF THIS BILL IS ON THE UTILITY

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:52.926
IN THE FOCUS I THINK IN MY

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:55.596
MIND. WOULD BE THE P. YOU SEE.

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:57.631
THEYHAVE FAILED US.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.633
TREMENDOUSLY FAILED US. WE

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.968
AUTHORIZED THEM AND I DON'T

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:02.669
WANT TO GO OUT AND- MAKE SURE

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.438
THE LINES WERE SECURED AND THAT

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.039
THEY HAD. PROGRESS MOVING

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:07.307
FORWARD. THEY DIDN'T EVEN

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.276
FOLLOW UP AND CHECK UP THEY DID

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:10.811
ABOUT 5% OF THE WORK. THAT

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:13.046
NEEDED TO BE DONE THE LAST YEAR

01:44:13.113 --> 01:44:15.182
AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO. RUN A

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:16.984
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT. THAT

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:18.218
IS LOOKING AT CREATING MORE

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:19.886
RATE PAYER THERE'S THIS IS

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.955
GONNA BE POSITIONS. FOR THE P.

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.624
YOU SEE ACTUALLY ANALYZE THIS

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:25.025
BILL AND COME UP WITH IT

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:26.793
WHETHER IT WAS. JUSTIFIED OR

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.795
NOT. WE'RE GONNA AUTHORIZED

01:44:28.862 --> 01:44:30.063
MORE POSITIONS WE NEED TO.

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:33.100
PURSUE ANALYZE THE- AGENCY THAT

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:36.103
IS. TO REGULATE THE UTILITIES

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:38.305
WHICH IS THE P. YOU SEE. AND IN

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:40.440
THE- EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:42.142
WHETHER IT'S WILD FIRE WHETHER

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:45.112
IT'S OUR PS. THE P. YOU SEE

01:44:45.178 --> 01:44:46.546
TAKES A STAND BACK AS IS ALL

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:47.714
THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO TELL TO

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:48.815
DO THAT WE TOLD THEM TO DO

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:51.451
SOMETHING. IN SB NINE A ONE AND

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:54.087
A FAILED US. HEARD LOUD YEAR

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:55.422
KNOWING FOR THE TIME THAT WE

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.024
WERE GOING TO HAVE THESE. HIGH

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:58.558
WINDS THAT YES WE'RE GOING TO

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.994
HAVE. MAKE SURE THAT UTILITIES

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:03.563
INCLUDING CELL TOWERS IN THOSE

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.165
YES THEY REPORTED BACK TO THEM

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:06.600
AND WHAT DID WE GET. WE GOT

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:07.734
POWER OUTAGE WE GOT CELL

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:10.570
SERVICE OUTAGE FOR DAYS ON END.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.539
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:14.608
FOCUS ON THE P. YOU SEE. THEY

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:17.044
ARE FAILING US HORRIBLY THEY'RE

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:20.547
APPOINTED BODY. THEY ARE NOT

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:21.381
DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO BUT WE

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:22.482
NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:25.018
BEFORE WE GO GIVING THEM MORE

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:27.454
DISCRETION TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:29.156
TO REGULATE UTILITIES WE NEED A

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:31.324
MICRO WORKS NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:34.094
SHUT DOWN OUR SYSTEM IN SMALL

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.296
AREAS NOT GIANTS WALLACE I WAS

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:49.076
THEY'RE GONNA GET COMPENSATED.

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.377
