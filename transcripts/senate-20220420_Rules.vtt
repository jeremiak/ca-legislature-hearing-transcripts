CHALLENGES WITH CAL HE ITC'S

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.480
COMPATIBILITY WITH ITS FEDERAL

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.783
COUNTERPART. SO A WHAT ARE SOME

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.952
pTHINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:09.722
ELIMINATE- THE AREAS OF

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.591
INCOMPATIBILITY SO THAT WE CAN

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.927
DO MORE TO GET WHAT IS DUE TO-

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.263
THE- WORKING POOR AND POOR

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.998
CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE AND

STATE'S FIRST OUT YEAH IDC.

GRANT PROGRAMS. NO I THINK THAT

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.959
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WERE

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.161
RESTARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.763
UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE NOW-

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.566
AFTER LAST ROUND OF NUMBERS IN

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.668
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.271
FIFTEEN WE SAW ROUGHLY THREE

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.238
HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.507
GRANTS- SEAT TALLY I TO SEE-

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:04.210
GRANTS GO OUT FOR ROUGHLY ABOUT

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.177
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:06.846
THROUGH THE COOPERATION COME

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:09.015
COOPERATION BETWEEN CST THE

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.850
FEDERAL THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.218
AS WELL AS OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.886
WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW UNITED

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.622
WAYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.858
THINK THAT THE WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:22.762
OUR CURRENT NUMBERS. WE GO FROM

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.297
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:25.531
THOUSAND THE FOUR POINT TWO

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.165
MILLION. AND OVER EIGHT HUNDRED

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.667
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:28.901
GRANTS ARE BEING EXPANDED SO I

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.070
THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A REAL

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:31.671
STRONG STEADY GROWTH OVER THE

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.205
PAST SIX YEARS. THIS YEAR'S

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:35.241
YEARS BEEN ADMINISTERING CAL YET

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.776
YOU SEE WHAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:37.843
WITH YOU THAT WOULD THERE'S

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.879
ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.782
BETTER AND TO GET. THE AWARENESS

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:45.117
OUT AND I THINK THAT. THAT'S THE

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.018
BIGGEST STRUGGLE THAT WE'RE

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.987
HAVING AND WE DON'T WNT TO LOSE

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.855
SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.057
CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE. THAT DO

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:54.060
NOT FILE TAXES. BUT COULD

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:57.530
BENEFIT FROM THE DOLLARS AND

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.332
SHOULD BENEFIT. SO I THINK THAT

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.033
THROUGH OUR REGION OUR REGIONAL

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.903
PARTNERS- THAT WE CAN'T CONTINUE

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.238
TO WORK ON MAKING AN AWARENESS

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:09.108
AND- OUTREACH. ONE OF THE

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.177
PRIMARY GOALS EACH AND EVERY

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:13.245
YEAR NOT JUST THE FREE TAX PREP

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:14.580
NOT JUST LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.248
THAT THERE'S DALY THE CHILD

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:17.783
CREDIT AS WELL NOT JUST DOING

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.785
THE I. TEN PORTION OF IT. THAT'S

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.121
ALL GREAT OF YOU KNOW ASPECTS OF

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:25.758
CALLIE IDC. BUT IF WE'RE NOT

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:29.161
GETTING THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT.

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:29.795
FILING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.864
THESE THESE AMAZING CREDIT- YOU

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:34.333
KNOW WE ARE NOT DOING ALL THAT

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.536
WE CAN AND IT IS I THINK AN

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:38.637
ONGOING OPPORTUNITY TO BE

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.639
BETTER. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.508
WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO REALLY

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.344
WORK ON THAT OUTRAGE TO CONTINUE

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.614
TO SEE THESE NUMBERS GROW. FROM

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.749
THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.250
THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FOUR POINT

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.486
TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:54.720
I THINK IS SHOWS. THAT WE ARE

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.422
COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.292
PROGRAM. AS WELL KNOWN AND AS

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.862
EXPOSURE RICH AS POSSIBLE AND

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.031
WILL CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS. TO

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.098
OPEN THOSE DOORS TO THOSE

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.401
CALIFORNIANS THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:09.769
AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.405
DOLLARS. BUT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:13.706
IT OR MAY NOT HAVE THE

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.008
OPPORTUNITY- TO GET FILING AND

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:18.844
RECEIVED THE DELEGATION TO SEE

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.147
GRANT. I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY- I

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:22.615
THINK THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.517
CAN BE DONE AND POSSIBILITIES

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:25.584
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.986
IMMENSE. YOU KNOW I KNOW MY

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.888
BUDGET SUB FOR COMMITTEE WE DID

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.823
HAVE A HEARING ON THIS AND I

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.058
THERE ARE PARTNERS ACROSS THE

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.794
STATE THAT ARE. I THINK WORKING

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.665
OF THEIR SELVES OFF- TO. GET

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.333
THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.769
COMMUNITIES AND IT'S- THEY WITH

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:44.804
THERE'S STILL MORE THAT NEEDS TO

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.872
BE DONE SO I WOULD JUST I THINK

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.941
THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD NOT

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:49.842
JUST BE LEANING ON THOSE

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.110
PARTNERS IN MAKING SURE THAT

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.578
THEY'RE DOING MORE OUTREACH

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.680
BECAUSE- FROM MY WHAT I WAS ABLE

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.215
TO READ AND ASCERTAIN THEY ARE

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:56.849
DOING QUITE A BIT- THERE. ARE

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.752
HARD TO REACH FAMILIES. THAT ARE

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.454
NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION OR

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.455
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SHARING

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.856
INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED OR

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:06.058

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.593
THERE YOU TALK ABOUT PARTNERS

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.462

00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:10.296
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE THERE

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.864
WAYS THAT WE CAN LEAN ON THEM. I

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.868
THINK THE- YOU KNOW I THINK

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.269
INITIALLY WELL THE DEPARTMENT

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.038
WOULD LIKE TO DO AGAIN IS EXPAND

REALLY THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:31.584
IN THE COMMUNITIES KNOWING FROM

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.952
THE BOTTOM UP WHAT THESE

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.221
COMMUNITIES NEED. AND IN DOING

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.223
THAT ONGOING OUTREACH AND REALLY

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.492
TRYING TO REACH LIKE YOU SAID IT

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:40.926
YOU KNOW I THINK THE THING IS

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.995
THAT THERE IS A LARGE PART OF

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.096
THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS AND

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:47.800
FAMILIES THAT COULD BENEFIT

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.101
FROM. THIS PROGRAM. I'M JUST

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.203
QUITE FRANKLY AFRAID TO PUT THAT

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.073
TRUST AND FAITH. IN THE

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.609
GOVERNMENT TO YOU KNOW. BE ABLE

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:57.743
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR THEM

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.146
AND I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST IT

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.248
IS A STRUGGLE. BUT WHEN WE- WHEN

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.683
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH- THE

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.319
CBO SAID THAT THE- THAT SOME OF

AGENCIES THAT REALLY ARE IN PART

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.132
OF THOSE OMMUNITIES WHERE THE

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.134
STRUGGLE IS VERY REAL. TO GET

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.969
THEM TO COME OUT THE TRUST THAT

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.938
THESE SERVICES- THEY CAN AVAIL

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.174
THEMSELVES- TO. I REALLY THINK

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.875
THAT DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.477
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WE CAN WE

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.746
CAN ABSOLUTELY LEVERAGE- AND

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.247
PROVIDE THOSE LINKAGES THAT ARE

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:40.319
OUR CURRENT NETWORK COUNTS. IN

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:41.954
THAT THEY DO ON THE DAILY. A

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.557
THANK YOU FOR THAT I WAS TAKEN

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.825

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.695
YOU HAVE- AND THIS IS MY LAST

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.865
QUESTION- MANY OF THE PROGRAMS

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:56.468
THAT YOU ADMINISTER- YOU KNOW

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:58.037
HAVE VERY SIMILAR PROGRAM

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:01.207
OBJECTIVES. AND SO JUST

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:03.209
WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOU

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.477
KNOW WAYS THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.379
BENEFITS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.915
WHILE MINIMIZING DUPLICATION OF

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.584
EFFORT- BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.285
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.486
CARES ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.822
WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE NEED OUT

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.991
TO CALIFORNIANS IN A WAY THAT

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.794
ISN'T DUPLICATIVE- OR OVER

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.097
BURDENSOME TO BUREAUCRACY DO YOU

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.799
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. YEAH

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.167
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT'S A

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:30.836
GREAT POINT TO MAKE AND- I WOULD

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.072
SAY THAT ON THE SRFACE A LOT OF

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:35.641
IT COULD APPEAR THAT THE KIND OF

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.843
SHARE THE SAME SPACE. BUT WHEN

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.011
WE DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.512
THESE POGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.747
COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:44.116
IS AN AMAZING FUNDING SOURCE

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.784
THAT CAN'T PROVIDE LINKAGES

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.621
LINKAGES ON LEVERAGING. ACROSS

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.823
VARIOUS DIFFERENT AREAS I'M NOT

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.391
JUST SERVICES BUT ALSO OUTCOMES

YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:55.861
FUNDING FOR FOOD BANKS BUT THEN

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.597
ALSO. ON THE JOB TRAINING OR

00:14:58.664 --> 00:14:59.665
RESIDENCY TRAINING WHERE SOMEONE

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.634
MIGHT WRITE AN AMAZING RESUME

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.602
AND GET A JOB AND HAVE THIS

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.471
AMAZING OUTCOME. OF FROM THAT

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.173
LINKAGE THAT C. S. B. G. IS

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.042
BRING IN FOR. OUR LOW INCOME

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.143
HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE HERE WITH

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.951
THE DEPARTMENT WHEN ALL THREE.

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.786
CENTER AROUND. THE DEPARTMENT

00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:17.189
AND AS NETWORK. BEING ABLE TO

TO TAKE A LOOK AT. OUR DATA WHAT

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.100
WE HAVE HOW CAN WE GET TO IT AND

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.035
I THINK THAT- WE ARE IN THE

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.803
CURRENT PLANNING STAGES OF

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.906

WE REALLY CAN USE DATA TO DRIVE

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.113
OUR DECISION MAKING. I THINK THE

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.681
SECOND POINT OF THAT I THINK IS

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.283
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.251

GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.135
SERVICES FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.103
LEVEL THAT WE'RE DOING SO WITH

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.272
COMPASSION AND EMPATHY AND

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:10.442
UNDERSTANDING. THE DIVERSITY

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:12.377
WITHIN THE- THEY IN. THAT ARE

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.946
THERE IN A JUSTICE IS THAT MAYBE

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:16.281
THERE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.482
AS THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE MODEL

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.785
THE WAY. AND THAT WE CAN HELP

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.987
OUR AGENCIES. UNDERSTAND THE

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.156
VALUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:26.091
THE STATE TAKES WITH THOSE-

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.893
PARTICULAR INITIATIVES. BUT THEN

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.761
WE ALSO WANT TO A BASELINE OF

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.164
WHERE OUR AGENCIES- I KNOW THAT

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.166
MANY OF THEM HAVE SPENT MANY

00:20:34.232 --> 00:20:36.969
MANY YEARS- ON. D. E. I. KNOW

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:41.106
JAKE WE CALL IT CHEN I HEAR THE

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.674
STATE THEY DO D. E. I. J. LOCAL

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.210
LEVEL I LIKE THE JET I WON YOU

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.144
KNOW JUST LISTEN YOU KNOW

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.180
EQUITY. DIVERSITY INCLUSION BUT-

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.982
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:51.383
HAVE REALLY REALLY ROBUST

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.685
PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND I WANT TO

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:55.887
FIND A WAY. TO DO THE EASY THING

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.456
LET'S JUST REPLICATE WHAT WORKS

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:59.324
LET'S FIND THE HOLES THAT WE

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.525
HAVE FILL THEM AND TAKE THE

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.327
STEPS FORWARD. AND THEN FINALLY

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.062
WHAT I'D LIKE US TO DO IS

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:05.764
CONTINUE TO THE COLLABORATION

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.866
WITH OUR NETWORK WE NEED TO HAVE

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.701
OPEN HONEST EASY COMMUNICATIONS

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:12.437
AND BY DOING THOSE THREE THINGS.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:13.372
I THINK THAT WHAT WE WILL

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.975
ACHIEVE. IS A BETTER SENSE OF.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.610
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.545
DOLLARS OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.648
AND WHO IS BENEFITING FROM THE-

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.850
HOW WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE BETTER

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.185
AND WE ALWAYS CAN EVERY SINGLE

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:27.619
YEAR THERE'S ALWAYS

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.521
OPPORTUNITIES TO BE BETTER. AND

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:32.257
THEN USE THOSE DECISION A DATA

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.559
POINTS THE FOCUS ON THE PERSON.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:37.529
AND THEN THAT WAY WE ARE MAKING

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:38.864
SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.299
ABSOLUTE BEST WE CAN WITH THE

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.901
DOLLARS AT HAND. BUT IT IS A

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.337

STRUGGLING AND WE WILL BE BETTER

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.885

YEAR WE DO PROVIDE BETTER DATA

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.622

CHILDREN'S OF COURSE WE WERE

ABLE TO NOT ONLY SPIN UP A BRAND

00:24:57.963 --> 00:25:01.566
NEW PROGRAM DEVELOP POLICIES-

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.236
THE LEGISLATURE WAS WAS GRACIA.

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:17.682
A GREAT. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:19.851
BE NIMBLE CREATIVE THINK OUTSIDE

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.721
THE BOX. AND I THINK THE OTHER.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.522
WE UNDERSTAND OF ALL NEW ID

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:27.325
PROGRAM. WE HAD TO STAND UP NEW

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:29.027
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS YOU KNOW IT

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:31.029
WAS IT WAS QUITE A LIST FOR

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:35.400
SURE- BUT I THINK THAT BY MARCH.

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.035
WELL I DON'T THINK I KNOW HE DID

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:38.570
IT WITHOUT ADDING A SINGLE

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:39.905
PERSON TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:41.640
CAME IN UNDER THE TIMELINE WE

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.842
HAD MINISTER EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:45.777
THAT WE COULD ADMINISTER. AND

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:47.245
THOSE DOLLARS WHEN OUT THERE ARE

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.546
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:51.383
CALIFORNIANS TO THE TWO NINE

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.651
HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:54.419
DOLLARS. TO PAY DOWN UTILITY

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:55.820
AVERAGES. ON THE SHELVES I

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.856
THINK. MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS.

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:00.592
JUST ANNOUNCED THAT. THE IS THAT

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:03.128
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH I WORK WAS

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:05.196
SUCH AN AMAZING GROUP OF ALL

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:06.798
STARS YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS TALK

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:09.501
ABOUT HOW. WE'RE THE SMALL BUT

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:12.771
MIGHTY- DEPARTMENT BUT EVERYONE

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.439
OF A ROCK STARS YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.840
NOT PULLING ANYBODY OUT OF. OF A

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.810
SMALL CLUB THERE ALREADY WHERE

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:22.647
YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THE- MR

00:26:22.714 --> 00:26:25.183
CASE. THAT WORK IN THIS PART

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.584
BECAUSE OF OUR SIZE YOUR CLOSE.

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:29.087
TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF THE

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.989
DECISIONS AND THAT THE POLICIES

00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:33.959
AND THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN OUR

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:34.859
NETWORK DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY. I

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.062
THINK IT GIVES A REALLY A CLEAR

00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:40.498
LENS AND AN IMPETUS. TO MAYBE GO

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.267
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER A LITTLE

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:45.070
BIT HARDER AND I KNOW. MY ENTIRE

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.772
TEAM DID THAT FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:50.709
NOW I DON'T THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:53.611
WE CAN DO THAT EVERY YEAR WE TRY

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:56.915
OF COURSE- BUT I THINK THE BEARS

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.683
ARE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE-

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.819
SENATOR WAS JUST REALLY NOT

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.721
HAVING TIME IF WE IF WE COULD-

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.756
WE WILL RESPOND UP LITTLE SMALL

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.459
DIVISION AND ADDED A FEW PEOPLE

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:08.093
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.228
RICHER. BUT WE HAVE THAT

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.229
OPPORTUNITY LET ME. LET ME ASK A

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:08.940
DUPLICATED. M. HOW IS THE

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.708
COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:13.077
CHANGED IF AT ALL OVER THE

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:14.112

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.848
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.383
IMPROVE THE STATE'S

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:18.983
ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.219
FUNDING SOURCE AND IF SO. CAN

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.922
YOU SHARE THAT INFORMATION. YEAH

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.423
ABSOLUTELY UNFORTUNATELY THAT

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:30.595
WASN'T A DUPLICATE. I WELCOME

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:33.698
THE QUESTION. I YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:34.899
THINK THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.768
THAT THE TEACHERS BLOCK GRANT

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:38.269
AGAIN IS SUCH AN AMAZING FUNDING

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.572
SOURCE AND IT'S AN AMAZING WAY

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:41.906
TO GET THE DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.841
BECAUSE IT'S- INVERTED. IT'S A

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:46.010
BOTTOM UP APPROACH TO PROVIDE

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.046
SERVICES TO THOSE IN NEED IN THE

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:50.682
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS

00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:51.983
BASED ON COMMUNITY. THE NEEDS

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.618
ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.286
BY OUR SUB GRANTEES TO THE

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.255
DEPARTMENT. AND THEY ARE THE

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.290
ONES. OF THROUGH THAT NEEDS

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:00.658
ASSESSMENT THROUGH THEIR THEIR

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:03.461
COMMUNICATION PLANS THEY EVERY

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.597
YEAR IDENTIFIED THEIR GOALS. WE%

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.265
WANT TO ACHIEVE ACTS WE WANT TO

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.434
ACHIEVE WHY WANNA CHOOSY AND

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.637
THEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.639
SEE HOW WE DID. AND SO I THINK

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.741
THAT IT'S THE GREAT SUCCESS. OF

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.210
COMMUNITY ACTION IT'S THE GREAT

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:20.144
SUCCESS OF OUR PUBLIC PARTNERS

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:22.280
AS WELL. I THINK IT'S WHITE

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.681
COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY SERVICES

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:24.882
BLOCK GRANT HAS BEEN SO

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:27.151
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HONESTLY I

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.487
WOULDN'T CHANGE MUCH IF ANYTHING

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:32.490
THAT I WOULD DO BETTER AS A

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.358

THAT. BUT AGAIN AS A SOURCE.

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.069
BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE AND

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:55.079
OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULDN'T

THE STATE. I THINK FIRST AND

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:43.388
FOREMOST THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.156
THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.692
ALL OF THESE FEDERAL GRANTS ARE

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.328
BASED ON LOCAL CONTROL. IT IS IT

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.197
IS OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THAT WE

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:55.833

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:08.279
THAT THEY CAN ANNUALLY WITHIN G.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:10.114
S. B. G. NOT SO MUCH WITH OUR

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.282
ALONG COME HOME ENERGY

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.584
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT THEY CAN

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:16.921
ADJUST- AS THEY THEY SEE- THOSE

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:19.657
THINGS CHANGE AND THE WAY THAT

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:22.627
WE I THINK ARE. ABLE TO BE

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.662
CREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AT THE

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.631
DEPARTMENT LEVEL IS WITH C. S.

AT ADDRESSES POLICY AND

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.606
PROGRAMMATIC CONCERNS AND SO WE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.443
STATE TIED INTO- REALLY KIND OF

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:39.844
THE HIGH LEVEL OF THINGS THAT

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.245
THE DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON SOME

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.181
OF THE NETWORK INOTES. AND ON

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.283
THE ENERGY SIDE THOUGH THE LOW

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:46.584
INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:47.985
PROGRAM SIDE WE HAVE AN ENERGY

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:50.087
CAL'S THE SAME TYPE OF SET UP

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:52.190
WHERE WE HAVE OUR LOCAL PARTNERS

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.592
AND WE HAVE THESE DIALOGUES ON

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.995
ON THE REGULAR AND WHEN WE HAVE.

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.964
A NEW PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE LIKE

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:02.133
THE IT'S GOT ANOTHER LOW INCOME

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.035
HOME WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM THE

TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.645
WAY THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.314
GOALS OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. AND

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.383
NOT HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.052
SINCE IT WAS A ONE TIME FUNDING

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.320
SOURCE OF THE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:23.554
MILLION DOLLARS SO I THINK

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.389
HAVING THAT OPEN COMMUNICATION

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.425

FIVE DATA COLLECTION AND- I'M

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:38.936
JUST THINKING ABOUT THE NUMBER

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:41.405
OF LIVES THAT YOU POTENTIALLY

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:44.008
TOUCHING CALIFORNIA. THROUGH

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.911

THINGS LIKE- EMERGENCY NEEDS NOT

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:54.552
NECESSARY. SARALEE THE LOW

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.121
INCOME WEATHERIZATION BUT BUT

00:35:57.188 --> 00:36:00.224
YEAH I. T. C. A U. WE UTILITIES

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:03.895
WATER ENERGY. YOU KNOW I SORT OF

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.596
WONDERED THERE'S A FRIGHTENING

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:06.697
PIECE OF THIS WHICH IS THE

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.766
GOVERNMENT KNOWS WHO YOU ARE BUT

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.935
IT BUT IN TERMS OF KNOWING WHERE

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.070
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY NEEDY

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.373
CONSTITUENTS AND RESIDENTS IN

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:19.176
CALIFORNIA THAT NEED HELP- IF

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.545
THERE WERE A SITUATION WHERE WE

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:22.547
WANTED TO MAKE SURE DO OUTREACH

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.384
RESOURCES FOR THIS CRITICAL

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.152
NEED- THAT CRITICAL NEED WOULD

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:30.922
YOUR DEPARTMENT BE ABLE TO DO

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:34.892
THAT. YES I BELIEVE SO AGAIN I

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:35.893
WOULD THINK IT WOULD REALLY

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.796
DEPEND ON WHAT THE PROGRAMMATIC

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.832
SHAPE OF THE DOLLARS LOOKS LIKE

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.467

PARTNERS DO THAT ALL THE TIME

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:48.272
AND I THINK THAT AGAIN. WE

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:50.341
UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEEDS FAR

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:52.209
OUTPACES THE DOLLARS THAT WE

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.011
ADMINISTER EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:55.913
UNFORTUNATE BUT THIS IS NOT AN

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.249
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM NONE OF OUR

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.723
VERY STRONGLY THAT OUR COMMUNITY

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.892
ACTION AGENCIES WITH C. S. B. G.

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:10.895
R. ENERGY GROUPS LOW INCOME HOME

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:11.896
ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ON THE

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.131
ENERGY SIDE. ARE REALLY DIALED

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:15.733
INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.603
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE THEY KNOW

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.705
WHERE. SERVICES COULD BE

00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:23.641
EXPANDED AND MOVED INTO-

DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT ROUNDS

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.011

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.880

IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S

THE LARGEST BARRIER THAT WE HAVE

TO TACKLE IS THE OVERALL PROBLEM

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:30.794
WITH HOUSING SUPPLY- AND THIS IS

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.996
GOING TO REQUIRE A MULTIFACETED

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:52.649
IMPORTANT PIECE. WE'RE VERY

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:55.519

THAT- CAL HFA. CAN SUPPORT THE

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:50.620
INCREASE OF ACCESSIBLE-

OF THE BOX. INNOVATIONS THAT ARE

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:10.907
MAY BE HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:13.076
. OR WE COULD SORT OF TEST CASE

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:16.646
HERE BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE-

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.181
CITIES WHERE THE COST OF LIVING

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.783
IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND THE

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.351
SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:24.587
INCREDIBLY LOW- AND SO THINGS

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.622
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IT'S

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.956
IMPORTANT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:28.992
THOSE BUT I TINK WE'RE ALWAYS

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.428

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.797
INNOVATIONS. AND POSSIBILITIES-

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:36.099
THAT WE COULD ALSO IMPLEMENT. TO

THAT THE OUR ANSWER TO THE

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:49.579
SUPPLY ISSUE IS A PROGRAM THAT

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.782
WE LAUNCHED BACK IN DECEMBER AND

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.551
IT IS THE ACCESSORY DWELLING

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:57.120
UNIT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.123
PROVIDES GRANTS OF UP TO FORTY

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.191
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EXISTING

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.493
HOMEOWNERS WHO FILLED AN EIGHTY

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.695
YEAR ON THEIR PROPERTY. THE

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:06.963
GRANT CAN BE USED FOR PRE

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.299
DEVELOPMENT COSTS PLANS AND SO

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:12.335
FORTH. AND WE OF ALLOCATED ABOUT

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:15.205
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GET

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.540
THIS PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND. IF

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:18.942
YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE STATE OF

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.077
CALIFORNIA HAS GONE OVER THE

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:24.481
PAST YEAR YOU'LL NOTE THAT THERE

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.883
IS A SIGNIFICANT THERE'S BEEN A

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.152
GROWTH IN INTEREST IN THIS AND

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:31.454
I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS ONE OF

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:32.856
THE PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE ABLE

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:36.326
TO. LEVERAGE IN A VERY LARGE WAY

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.094
OVER THE COMING YEARS. I ALSO

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.963
WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.598
THAT I AM PARTICULARLY EXCITED

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.900
ABOUT IT'S CALLED THE FORGIVABLE

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:46.035
EQUITY BUILDER PROGRAM. WITH

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:48.404
THIS PROGRAM WE'RE WE WILL BE

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.940
PROVIDING UP 210% OF THE

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:56.246
PURCHASE PRICE- AS A DP A LOAN.

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.213
FOR THAT BECOMES FORGIVABLE

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.681
AFTER FIVE YEARS THIS IS A

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:01.818
PROGRAM FOR FOLKS THAT ARE AT

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:05.188
80% A. EMMA- AND WHAT I LOVE

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:07.056
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:09.459
ALSO TOUCHES SOME OF THE

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:12.595
INEQUITIES THAT. AND THEN ALSO

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:14.464
BUT ALSO HELPS WITH

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:16.900
INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH FOR

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:17.934
FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:20.303
SYSTEMATICALLY AS WELL AS

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.673
LEGALLY- DISENFRANCHISED BY OUR

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.177
HOUSING MARKET. SO THIS IS ONE

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:30.046
THAT I CALLED THE GAME CHANGER.

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.015
AND I HOPE THAT FOLKS WILL GET

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:35.018
EXCITED ABOUT THIS IN SHARE IN

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.686
THE M. MESSAGING AROUND THIS

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.621
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO DO

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:41.191
SO MUCH THE TURN AROUND SOME OF

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.592
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.794
CALIFORNIA. NOW MS JOHNSON HOW I

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.863
TOLD YOU THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.065
TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.835
HEARING BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:53.837
TO GET ALL OF THAT MONEY IN MY

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:59.242
DISTRICT. I'M SORRY YOUR MY

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:04.547
GOODNESS MY GOODNESS I'M- SAY

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:07.383
THAT- THE MIX INCOME PROGRAM IS

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.853
OVERSUBSCRIBED- AT EACH

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.988
APPLICATION CYCLES SO THAT ALSO

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:13.523
SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.958
TRYING TO FIND MORE

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:17.193
OPPORTUNITIES- TO FUND THAT

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.662
BECAUSE IT IT THAT SEEMS TO BE

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.431
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL YES. YES

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.199
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:23.867
ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAVE AN

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.468
ALTERNATIVE CALL IN AN

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:27.570
ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. YOU'RE

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.572
RIGHT THE BOND PROGRAM IS REALLY

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.341
QUITE OVERSUBSCRIBED BUT WE

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:34.677
INTRODUCED LAST YEAR A RECYCLED

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.613
BOND PROGRAM. IT'S A LITTLE

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:39.249
COMPLICATED BUT EFFECTIVELY WHAT

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:41.251
IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:43.353
TRANSFER OF TAX EXEMPT BONDS OF

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:45.355
THE TAX EXEMPT BOND AUTHORITY TO

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:48.524
OTHER PROJECTS. SO THE IMPORTANT

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:50.526
PART ABOUT THIS THE POOR NOTE

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.762
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:55.632
THAT IT DOES NOT GO AFTER

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:58.134
EXISTING BOND ALLOCATION OR TAX

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.536
CREDITS IT'S A IT'S KIND OF A GO

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:03.339
AROUND. AND SO THIS IS A PROGRAM

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:04.974
THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY SIGNED AN

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:08.678
MOU WITH THE SAN DIEGO AS WELL

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.747
AS OAKLAND. AND SO FAR AND WE

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:12.749
THINK THAT BY AT THE END OF THE

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:13.816
DAY WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.785
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.854
THREE THOUSAND UNITS OUTSIDE OUR

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.990
ALREADY OVERTAXED SYSTEM. SO WE

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:24.127
HAVE A PLAN TO GET THIS OUT TO

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.930
AS MANY CITIES THAT CAN WHO HAVE

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:29.899
EXISTING. FOR ISSUERS OF BONDS

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.868
AND HAVE EXISTING PORTFOLIOS

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:34.570
WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND-

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:37.440
SOME TRANSACTIONS. TO FACILITATE

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:40.410
THIS PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU

IMPORTANT CERTAINLY IS THE

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.470
BACKGROUND FOR MY FAMILY WHERE

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.305
MY POOR MOM HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.973
WHEN SHE WAS MERELY FOURTEEN

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.443

COMING YEARS I DO HAVE ONE QUICK

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.908
QUESTION. REGARDING THE MIXED

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.311
INCOME PROGRAM FINANCE PROJECTS

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.946
ARE THAT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:32.281
REACH CONSTRUCTION QUICKER. AND

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.916
FOR LESS THAN OTHER COMPARABLE

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.718
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WAS IN THE

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.420
BACKGROUND INFORMATION- IS THAT

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:40.923
ACCURATE AND- IF SO- WHAT MIGHT

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:45.128
BE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT AND

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.262
SOMETHING MAYBE WE NEED TO BUILD

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.097
ON. THANK YOU SENATOR- THAT IS

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:52.135
ACCURATE- EVEN TODAY- THAT

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.170
PROGRAM WAS VERY SPECIFICALLY

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:57.173
DESIGNED FOR COST EFFICIENCY AND

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.675
FOR THE ABILITY TO BRING

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.178
TRANSACTION TO FRUITION. AND THE

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.914
OTHER QUICK REMOTE MORE AND IN A

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.850
IN A IN A FAST WAY- WHAT WE HAVE

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.385
NOTICED BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.187
ISSUES IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:14.056
SLOWER BUT STILL. QUICKER THAN

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.424
WHAT YOU WOULD GENERALLY SEE

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.260
WITH THE TWO OTHER- FINANCING

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:21.030
CHANNELS- AND SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:24.400
EVEN TODAY- THE PROGRAM WHAT WE

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.770
WILL SEE. IS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.539
WILL BE COMING TO FRUITION IN

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.073
JUST A FEW YEARS WILL HAVE THOSE

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.475
PROJECTS ACTUALLY ALBUM

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.578
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.747
THEY COULD MOVE IN. I THINK WHAT

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:41.584
HAS MADE IT MEMORABLE AND IS

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.954
ACTUALLY THE TERMS OF THE OF THE

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.690
PROGRAM ITSELF- AND THE FACT

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.259
THAT WITH THE PROGRAM WE ARE

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:54.830
PROVIDED FINANCING WE ARE ALSO.

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:57.967
PROVIDED WITH BONDS AND JUST

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:01.037
THOSE TWO SOURCES ARE OFTEN JUST

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.707
OF SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO MOVE THE

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.609
PROCESS THROUGH QUICKLY.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.878
OFTENTIMES AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:11.480

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:14.483
SEOUL SOURCES SOMETIMES FIVE

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.252
FIVE SIX SEVEN SOURCES AND SO

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:19.422
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:23.259
OUR PROGRAM MOVES. HIM TO MOVE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.794

EVERYBODY ELSE ALTHOUGH I

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.826
CLEARLY DO NOT HAVE A SORORITY

01:04:56.892 --> 01:05:01.364
CONNECTION- THE YOU WERE VERY

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.366
ELOQUENT IT IN YOUR OPENING

HOUSING AGENCIES OR WHETHER IT'S

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.612
WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THEN

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.247
YOU WERE REALLY ELOQUENT ABOUT

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:20.916
YOUR OWN STORY. I THINK THE YOU

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.518
KNOW ONE OF THE TWO QUESTIONS I

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.387
HAVE IS YOU ARE HEADING AN

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.622
AGENCY THAT HAS PROGRAMS THAT

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.557
ARE PRESCRIBED THEY REALLY THEY

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.359
HAVE RULES THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.794
WAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.696
IMPLEMENT THEM OR ACT ON THEM

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.798
HOW DO YOU TAKE THE COMMITMENT

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.733
THAT YOU DEMONSTRATED IN YOUR

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.503
OPENING STATEMENT AND YOUR

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.504
EXPERIENCE. MAKE PROGRAMS MIGHT

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.106
BE VERY PRESCRIBED WORK IN THE

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.008
WAY THAT YOUR VALUES TELL YOU

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.911
THEY SHOULD WORK- VERY GOOD

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.980
QUESTION SENATOR THANK YOU FOR

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.749
IT. I THINK THE WAY THAT I LOOK

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.651
AT THIS IS THAT OUR PRODUCTS

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.853
NEED TO BE AS DIVERSE AS OUR

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.755
HOUSING. AND SO ONE WAY TO

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:02.491
TACKLE THAT IS TO COME UP WITH

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.260
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. ON TO

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:07.396
ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. AND SO ONE

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.664
OF THE THINGS THAT I TALK ABOUT

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.000
THAT WHITE SPACE IN AND LOOKING

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:12.835
AT WAYS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.937
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INNOVATIVE

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.506
IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE WORKED

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.076
GOING FORWARD. SO I THINK THE

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.110
WAY THAT YOU ANSWER THAT

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:22.845
QUESTION IS THAT THE WAY TO

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.513
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BEST IN A

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.949
WAY TO WORK WITHIN THOSE.

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:29.552
PRESCRIBED BEST IS TO COME UP

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:30.820
WITH AS MANY PRODUCTS AS WE CAN

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:33.356
DELIVER WITH THE RESOURCES THAT

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:34.824
WE HAVE. THE THAT'S PART OF MY

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:38.094
PLAN. I'VE GOT- SEVERAL SEVERAL

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.795
THINGS IN MY BACK POCKET THAT I

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.964
HAVE FOOLED. FROM MY BANKING

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:44.166
EXPERIENCE AND ALSO MINDS

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.668
EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY WORKING IN

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:46.902
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:49.305
WORKING NATIONALLY. AND SO

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.307
THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.641
GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. IN

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.777
IS COMING UP WITH AS MANY

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.514
PRODUCTS AS BEFORE. MAN IN THAT

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:00.282
PROCESS IF. YOU FIGURE OUT THAT

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.984
THERE'S SOME WAYS THAT THE

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.487
PROGRAMS COULD BE STRUCTURED

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.989
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. IS THAT

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:07.923
SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.159
HEAR FROM YOU WHERE ARE WILL

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.094
CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:14.497
IF YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.297
THAT COULD BE DONE. THAT BETTER

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.500
MEETS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE THAT

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:20.569
ARE. ELIGIBLE FOR YOUR PRODUCTS

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.805
THAT YOU WILL. COMMUNICATE WITH

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.775
US. ABSOLUTELY WE WILL

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.344
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. I WILL SAY

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.313
THIS AS WELL SENATOR. THAT WHILE

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.183
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT A LOT OF OUR

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.050
PRODUCTS ARE PRESCRIBED NOT JUST

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:37.686
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT AT THE

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:39.789
FEDERAL LEVEL WE ARE SEEING

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.457
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE FOLKS

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:44.794
LISTEN A LOT MORE- THEY WANT

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.129
THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK AS- BEST

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:50.399
AS THEY CAN. AND SO WE HAVE NOT

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:54.737
BEEN SHY ABOUT USING OUR NETWORK

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.273
TO CHALLENGE THOSE

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.675
PRESCRIPTIONS. AND WELL YOU KNOW

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.877
IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE END OF

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.213
THE DAY IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.748
THEM TO HELP WITH THAT. BUT THEY

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.716
OPEN ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.018
THINGS BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:10.953
INTERESTED AT THIS POINT IN.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.689
HELPING PEOPLE GET HEALTH AS A

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.292
PRIORITY. SO THERE'S FLEXIBILITY

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.461
IN THE MARKET. NOT A LOT OF

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.863
FLEXIBILITY BUT AT LEAST FOLKS

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.932
ARE REALLY WILLING. TO RETHINK

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:26.869
IT AND ASK THEMSELVES IF

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:29.672
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. YOU KNOW.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.607
SO IF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:34.210
THE LEGISLATURE LIKE YOURSELF

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.480
THEN YOU ALL HELPING US TO MAKE.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.582
THAT CASE AND TELL THAT STORY

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:42.284
THAT I THINK IS GOING TO HELP

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:45.354
GOING FORWARD. OKAY WELL I WOULD

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.857
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. RESPONSE

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.626
AND I HOPE WE DO IT AND HE HAD A

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.561
SMILE ON HOPE AND MY SPOUSE WAS

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:53.929
NOT WATCHING BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:54.763
THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:56.765
THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.334
EIGHTY YOU. THE LAST THING I

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.504
WOULD HAVE NEEDED IS FOR HIM TO

01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:02.738

MAY BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER- AND

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.837
IT JUST JUST KIND OF A LITTLE

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:23.639
MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT ABOUT WHAT

. THANK YOU SENATOR. WELL ONE OF

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.453
THE KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.322
PROGRAM IS OUR LINDER NETWORK IN

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:43.425
THAT'S ALSO THE KEY COMPONENT OF

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.526
BUILDING AN EIGHTEEN YEAR WITH

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:47.396
WELL- AND SO ONE OF THE-

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.631
CHALLENGES THAT WE DO SEE IS

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:52.167
THAT ARE THE LENDER NETWORK IN

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.802
THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.571
AB YOU DEVELOPMENT. IS NOT AS

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:58.607
ROBUST AS WE HAD INITIALLY

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:01.009
THOUGHT- THERE ARE CITIES THAT I

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.778
BELIEVE THAT ARE MORE ROBUST

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.347
THAN OTHERS IN IN TERMS OF

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:07.616
FINDING. A PARTNER AND A

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.685
CONSTRUCTION LENDER PARTNER TO

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:12.121
WORK WITH SACRAMENTO HAPPENS TO

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:14.223
BE ONE OF THEM. THEY'VE GOT SOME

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.458
GREAT PARTNERS THERE BUT WE'RE

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.894
WORKING VERY HARD TO INCREASE

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:21.363
THE NUMBER OF LENDERS WHO ARE

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:24.566
AVAILABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THIS

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.535
BUSINESS AS A PRIORITY. OF

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:29.705
COURSE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:34.042
DEVELOPING- WOULD DEVELOPING

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:37.012
PARTNERSHIPS WITH NONTRADITIONAL

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.580
PARTNERSHIPS WITH CDFI

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:40.582
ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE TALKING

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.117
ABOUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.520
THEY'VE BEEN ON THE GROUND FOR A

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:45.921
VERY LONG TIME AND SO WE ARE

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.956
EXTENDING THE TYPES OF LENDERS

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.625
THAT WE ARE DOING WORK WITH SO

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.461
THAT WOULD INCLUDE CDFI. CREDIT

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.396
UNIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT-

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:58.534
TEND TO BE ABLE TO BE A LITTLE

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.636
BIT MORE NIMBLE IN THE FACE- I

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:03.438
THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME ROBUST

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.407
ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES I

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:07.943
MENTIONED SACRAMENTO WE ARE ALSO

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.680
SEEING IN SAN JOSE. ANOTHER AREA

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:14.149
ON AND SO WE THINK IN PART OF

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.818
THE REASON WHY WE INCREASED OUR

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.252
AMOUNTS TO FORTY THOUSAND

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.988
DOLLARS IS THAT WE THINK THAT-

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:22.658
WITH OUR ADDITIONAL OUTREACH

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:25.360
RELATIVE TO MARKETING WHETHER

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:27.963
THAT BE ONLINE AND SO FORTH BOB

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.133
WILL BE SOME WAYS TO PICK UP ON

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.335
THIS ACTIVITY IN A BIG WAY. BUT

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.571
IT WILL BE CHALLENGING- PEOPLE

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.372
STILL ARE A LITTLE BIT I THINK

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.707
IN GENERAL FOLKS ARE A LITTLE

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.008
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:43.111
COST OF REAL. WHICH CAN BE OF

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:47.783
CONSIDERABLE. AND FOR SOME FOLKS

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.651
WHO WERE THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.653
POPULATIONS IT MIGHT EVEN BE

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.422
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND DIFFICULT

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.858
GIVEN THE OVERALL COST METRIC

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:59.194
FOR THIS. SO WE'RE ALSO REACHING

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:03.232
OUT TO- PARTNERS CITIES WHO ARE

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:05.167

THESE LOCATIONS IS VITALLY

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.823
IMPORTANT NOT ONLY AT THE-

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.959
COUNTY JAIL LEVEL BUT ALSO IN

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.360
THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS.

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.162
AROUND THE STATE THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:56.397
CRITICAL TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE-

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:59.199
CHIEF AIDS. AIDS ON THE- BOARDS

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:02.303

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:02.903
TO PEOPLE AND GET INFORMATION

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.639
FAIRLY QUICKLY. THE SECOND IS WE

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.341
HAVE TO TRUST OUR PROFESSIONAL

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.543
STAFF AT THE BSE SIX. THEY ARE

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:12.846

01:39:12.913 --> 01:39:15.416
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO I'VE GOT

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:19.520
FOR. AND THEN LASTLY ARE TWO

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:20.754
MORE THINGS ONE IS WE NEED TO

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.423
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT DATA.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:25.959
STATEWIDE DATA TO FIND OUT- WHAT

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.828
EXACTLY IS GOING ON WHAT IS THAT

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:29.730
DATE I MEAN JUST OUTSIDE THE

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.031
STANDARD DEVIATION OF WHAT IS

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:35.035
TYPICAL FOR A- A FACILITY. I AM

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.670
LOOKING AT FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:39.106
WHO CHOOSE. NOT TO REPORT OUT TO

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.408
CC. END UP PUTTING PRESSURE ON

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.043
THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR-

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.012
COMING INTO COMPLIANCE. AND THEN

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.714
THE LAST THING IS I REALLY.

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.148
TRULY BELIEVE THAT SEEMS SO

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:50.150
IMPORTANT ON THE FOR THE BSE

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:52.252
SEAT OUT PEOPLE WITH LIVED

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.554
EXPERIENCE LIKE WE DO. ON THE

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.789
BOARD. BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.558
GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INFORMATION

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:59.526
THAT WE WOULD NOT. OTHERWISE

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:01.795
HALF AND SO I THINK THAT ALL

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.864
THOSE THINGS TOGETHER. WILL

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.799
ALLOW US TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:08.435
A VERY CUTE ACUTE AWARENESS OF

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:12.106
WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. IN THE

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:12.773
FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE. FOR

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.808
YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.777

ALSO THAT. OUR SUPERVISOR CHAVEZ

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:23.484
SAID AT THE BEGINNING. THAT ARE

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.251
PART OF THIS IS A LEARNING

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.253
PROCESS WHERE YOU MIGHT REFLECT

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.490
US THINGS THAT. ARE NECESSARY OR

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:30.624
YOU'VE LEARNED OR WHAT THERE

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.259
MIGHT BE FURTHER ACTION AND I

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:34.762
WOULD INVITE ALL THREE OF YOU TO

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:37.131
DO THAT. I THINK THE LAST THING

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.499
I'D LIKE TO DO IS ASK A

01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:39.767
QUESTION. A DIRECTLY OF

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:42.836

AGGRESSIVE ACTION EVEN THOUGH

01:40:58.152 --> 01:40:59.853
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY IN

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.922
CHARGE OF THE JAIL. TO DEAL WITH

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:04.191

OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:20.107
HAD HERE IS. A WELL WE'VE HAD A

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:21.775
NUMBER OF THEM BUT ONE REALLY

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.644
STARTED WHEN WE HAD OF A MURDER

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:26.213
IN OUR JAILS FIGHT TO. REXALL

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.316
OFFICERS. AND AND THIS HAPPENED

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:33.787
IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OR YEP

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:34.688
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND FROM

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.590
THAT POINT ON WE WORK VERY

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.025
CLOSELY FRANKLY WITH THE SHERIFF

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.693

WASN'T WORKING IN OUR JAILS WHAT

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:48.769
DO WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND HOW WE

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:49.670
CAN IMPROVE IT. AND ONE OF THE

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:52.139
THINGS I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:53.674
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL IS THAT.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:54.341
THE EMPHASIS ON TRANSPARENCY THE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:56.443
EMPHASIS ON ACCOUNTABILITY IS.

01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.113
PARAMOUNT I THINK WHAT- WHAT I

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.782
WOULD SAY THAT THAT AS I THINK

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.617
ABOUT THE FUTURE I THINK ONE

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:04.852
THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.420
ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS AND ALL

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:08.188
THAT ALL THE CHANGES THAT WE

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:10.357
MAKE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:11.358
CRITICAL TRANSPARENCY IS

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:13.594
CRITICAL. BUT I WOULD SAY THE

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:14.895
MOST IMPORTANT THING AND THAT'S

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:15.662
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:18.165
WORKING ON IS HOW WE CHANGE THE

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:20.834
CULTURE. OF THESE INSTITUTIONS.

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.836
AND SOME OF THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:24.571
AT PHYSICAL DESIGN WE HAVE TO

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:26.073
LOOK AT LEADERSHIP WE HAVE TO

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.641
LOOK AT PURPOSE. WE ARE IN OUR

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:30.110
COUNTY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:31.078
REBUILDING OUR JAIL AND ONE OF

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:32.613
THE CONCERT I HAVE ABOUT

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.414
REBUILDING IT IS THAT WE'RE-

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.082
BUILDING. A JAIL WHILE WE'RE IN

01:42:35.148 --> 01:42:36.550
THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:37.818
CULTURAL CHANGES WE MOST WANT TO

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:40.721
SEE OUR INSTITUTION. ON SO I

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.523
THINK THE WAY THAT'S PREPARED ME

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.924
AS BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT. EVEN

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:46.326
WITH ALL. THE BEST RULES IN

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:47.995

MISTAKES AND WE HAVE AN

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:51.031
OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO

IMPROVE AND- AN OBLIGATION TO BE

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:54.568
TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT. BECAUSE

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:56.403
MORE TRANSPARENT WE ARE THE MORE

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:58.171
WE HELP EACH OTHER ACROSS THE

01:42:58.238 --> 01:43:00.173
STATE REALLY LEFT WHAT I THINK

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.174
ARE. PRETTY LOW STANDARDS IN

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:06.046
SOME INSTANCES. WE'RE. REALLY

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:07.180
TRYING TO- FRANKLY IF WE'RE-

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:09.416
RISK. ARE INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.151
REFLECT THAT AND I THINK THAT'S

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:13.554
GIVEN ME I HAVE. A PERSPECTIVE

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.055
THAT'S BOTH ON THE GROUND BUT

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:18.225
RECOGNIZING THAT. THERE'S A LOT

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.426
OF CHANGE THAT COULD HAPPEN

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:20.961
STATEWIDE. THANK YOU I REALLY

FORWARD TO TAKE THIS VERY VERY

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.987
IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT- I DO HAVE

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.555
A QUESTION FOR ALL THREE

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:50.724
REGARDING- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:52.559
HAVE BEEN FLOATING AROUND GIVING

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:54.227
THE BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.463
ENFORCE THIS REGULATIONS. SINCE

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:57.531
I THINK ONE OF THE TOP

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.733
PRIORITIES FOR YOUR BOARD IS

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.536
SETTING STANDARDS FOR INSPECTION

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.338
OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES.

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:05.639
AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:06.773
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER YOU

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.342
SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:10.043
ENFORCE REGULATIONS AND PERHAPS

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.512
THE CHALLENGES. ARM YOU KNOW THE

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:15.082
HIGH RISKS THAT SHARE OF SPACE

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:17.284
IN RUNNING LOCAL JAILS- THAT

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:17.751
NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO

01:44:17.818 --> 01:44:19.920
CONSIDERATION ARE IF THE BOARD

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:21.888
IS GRANTED THAT AUTHORITY AND

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.690
THAT KIND OF A COMPLICATED

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:24.992
QUESTION BUT I BELIEVE THE L. A.

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:27.260
O. WHEN I WAS LOOKING OUT TO.

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.362
THE ROLE AND THE

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:29.463
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.698
OUTCOMES THAT PERHAPS THE LACK

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:34.034
OF A CERTAIN TOOLS FOR

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.470
ENFORCEMENT MIGHT ENHANCE OUR

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:39.606
THE ABILITY OF YOUR OR BOARD TO

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:43.644
ACTUALLY DO THE JOB IN TERMS OF.

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:49.383
ENFORCEMENT OF THE- SETTING. SO

THEM AND CERTAINLY FAR AND OUT

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:53.286
IF IT'S A UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.588
AND COULD SHE ON THE RECORD WAS

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:57.124
SOMETHING ARE YOU CAN BE BIG.

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:59.059
BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:00.527
ONE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHEN

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:03.230
THAT COMES OUT OF IN. AN AUDIT

01:45:03.296 --> 01:45:04.898
TO REVIEW BUYER L. A. OLD OUT

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.600
THERE MIGHT BE A TOOL IT'S

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:09.903
MISSING THAT WOULD HELP YOU MEET

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.605
ABOUT MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY.

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.774
THANK YOU OUR CHIEF MILLS LET ME

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.676
ASK YOU TO START AND THEN WE'LL

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.511
GO TO A SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ AND

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:22.516
THEN TO- CHIEF PAINS. SO WHAT

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:23.750
SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:25.819
QUESTION AND NOT IT REALLY GETS

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:27.654
TO THE HEART OF THE PURPOSE OF

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.723
THE B. S. YOU SEE AND WHAT WE

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:30.957
WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IN THE FUTURE

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:32.859
AND OBVIOUSLY AS THE SENATE-

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.995
PRIORITIZE PRIVATE IT ROCKETED

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:37.964
TO. DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.666
WHICH YOU WANT TO SEE

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.702
ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY AT THE B.

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.837
S. C. CURRENTLY THERE REALLY IS

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:45.839
NONE. OTHER THAN TO CALL PEOPLE

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:48.508
TO- THE BSE AND HAVE THEM REPORT

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:51.978
OUT AS WE DID I JUST RECENTLY. I

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:53.680
THINK THIS YEAR MISPERCEPTION

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:56.717
ANI- WAS CALLED TO BE A CC TO

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:59.386
TESTIFIED TO EXPLAIN I HAD MET

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.354
ONE OF THE- CONDITIONS OF THE

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:04.224
REGULATIONS OF THE SEC. HE DID A

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.426
WONDERFUL PRESENTATION WAS ABLE

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.495
TO LEVERAGE THAT INTO OBTAINING

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:11.098
MORE STAFFING IN ORDER TO BE

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:12.766
ABLE TO ACTUALLY MEET. OTHER

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.735
CRITERIA YES YOU SEE HIMSELF OR

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:15.836
SO I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:18.004
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:19.973
CALL PEOPLE FORWARD HAVE THEM

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.109
TESTIFY. I DO WANT TO LET YOU

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:25.212
KNOW THAT EACH OF US RECOGNIZES.

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:27.447
HOW DIFFICULT A JOB IT IS FOR

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:29.683
SHARE RUN A CUSTODY FACILITY NO

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:32.352
THAT IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK I WILL

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:33.920
FLY THE SHERIFF'S ALL OVER THE

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:36.690
STATE FOR THEIR ABILITY TO. RUN

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.858
AS BEST AS THEY CAN AND

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.526
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS GIVEN

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:42.529
LIMITATIONS THAT THEY HAVE OR

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:46.666
POLITICALLY AS WELL. AS REPORTS

01:46:46.733 --> 01:46:48.802
WHY. I PUT IN THE SAME TIME WANT

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:49.803
TO MAKE SURE THE STANDARD ARE

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:52.706
CAP HIGH AND THAT MAY TWO. IN

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:53.740
MAY NEED TO TAKE. ENFORCEMENT

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:56.276
CAPABILITY. ARE REGULATED

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:59.079
REGULATORY CAPABILITY AT THE BSE

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:00.814
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:02.682
TO THE SENATE. IN THE

01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:04.851
LEGISLATORS IS THAT IF YOU'RE

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:06.386
GOING TO DO THAT. THERE IT'S

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.221
VERY CLEAR WHERE THE RESOURCES

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:10.457
WILL COME FROM. AND SO THAT HOW

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:12.192
WE CAN SUPPORT THE STAFF TO BE

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.495
ABLE TO DO THAT AND TO DO IT NAY

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:16.296
VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY- THIS NOT

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:17.798
HEAVY HANDED BUT AT THE SAME

01:47:17.864 --> 01:47:19.499
TIME REALLY DOES EVERYTHING WE

01:47:19.566 --> 01:47:20.634
CAN TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.736
WHO ARE HOUSED. AT THE FACILITY

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:25.338
AT THE FACILITIES AS WELL AS-

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:26.606
THOSE WHO ARE WORKING AT THE

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:30.811
FACILITIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:32.145
THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU SUPER

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:36.016
pAND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:37.317
QUESTION. I WOULD JUST CAN KERR

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:40.053
WITH CHIEF MALES THAT- I THINK

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.788
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.090
RESPONSIBILITY THAT. IS BESTOWED

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:46.059
UPON THAT THE SEC IF THAT'S THE

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.161
WILL OF THAT. THE LEGISLATURE

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:50.263
I'M SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WHATEVER

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:52.098
RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD HAVE A

01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:53.266
COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:55.402
SO FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:59.306
IS THAT. IF THERE ARE NEW-

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:00.540
RESPONSIBILITIES AND YOU WITH

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:02.409
THE WORDY GIVEN WE WOULD WANT

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:04.511
THE AUTHORITY TO BE MEANINGFUL.

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:05.812
AND NOT EVEN IF WE WOULD WANT

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:07.180
THE AUTHORITY AND WITH THE

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.915
COMMUNITIES EXPECTATIONS ARE TO

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:10.784
MATCH. UP BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:12.819
THE CHALLENGES FOR THE SEC IS

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:13.687
THAT THEIR PEOPLE ENOUGH IN THE

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:16.089
COMMUNITY YOU THINK THAT IT HAS

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.057
A LOT MORE. POWER THAN IT THAN

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:18.992
IT CURRENTLY DOES TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:21.461
RESOLVE- SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.597
THAT THAT- SOURCE AND THEN THE

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:24.931
COMMENSURATE INDICATIONS OF THAT

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.666
EVERYBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDS

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:28.468
WHAT THE CAPACITY OF THE SEC IS.

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:30.437
I THINK WOULD BE IDEAL. THE ONLY

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.105
OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT.

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.740
YOU KNOW THE UNDER THE

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:35.242
LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE I

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.710
THINK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN VERY

01:48:36.776 --> 01:48:37.944
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE KINDS OF

01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:39.779
REFORMS AND CHANGES THAT YOU

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:42.515
WANT TO SEE ON THE GROUND. I

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.683
THINK BEING ABLE TO RAISE SOME

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:44.818
OF THE MINIMUM STANDARDS

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.052
AGAINST. SOME MORE CONSISTENCY

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:48.722
ACROSS THE STATE- IS VERY

01:48:48.788 --> 01:48:50.390
IMPORTANT AND I THINK IF THE

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:52.692
LEGISLATURE WORK TO- GIVE THE

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:55.128
SEC MORE. AUTHORITIES THEN I

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:57.330
THINK THE OTHER POINT THAT SHE

01:48:57.397 --> 01:48:58.965
FELL ST I JUST WANNA RELAX THAT

01:48:59.032 --> 01:49:05.171
RARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT.

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:06.640
THE WHERE YOU THINK THAT- WHAT

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.074
KIND OF A- TOOL WE WOULD HAVE

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:09.976

A LITTLE MUFFLED BEFORE BUT WE

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.791
COULD STILL MAKE IT OUT BUT THIS

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.760

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:35.235

IMPORTANT TO NOTE REGARDING THE

WHICH ARE. PROFESSIONAL FOLKS

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:51.685
WHO WORK FOR- JOB OF TAKING A

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:53.653

AROUND- WHAT REGULATIONS MAY-

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:01.561
BE- VIOLATION AT THAT TIME THE

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.829

IN ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.345
FORTY IT JUST IT CHANGES THE

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:20.080
RELATIONSHIP. OF A BIT IN IN I

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:22.916
THINK IN A WAY THAT I THINK THE

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:24.417
RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:50:24.484 --> 01:50:26.386
BUILT OVER THE YEARS ON WHETHER

TO BE ADULT OR A JUVENILE

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.857
FACILITIES I THINK IT'S ONE

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:38.732
THAT'S BEEN. ON. PROFESSIONALISM

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:41.735
OF BOTH YOU KNOW- JAILS- STAFF

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:43.470

PROVIDE. THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:48.575
YOUR FOR THEM TO RUN. ISSUES

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:51.111
THAT MAY HAPPY- I. GIVEN THERE

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:52.879
FORTY YES HAS NOW IN UNDERSTOOD

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:55.181
AND FROM. SHE WAS CORRECT IN WE

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:57.484
HAD. MERCED DECADE SHERIFF'S. IN

01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:59.919
THE- THAT. THAT BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.688
WORK THAT GETS USED AT THE-

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:04.024
BECAUSE OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:05.925
CAME FROM THE PSEC THEY WERE

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:08.061
ABLE TO. THE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:09.596
TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:13.967
HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF. WHICH IS

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:16.569
LEADING TO SOME. ABU THAT. SO

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.772
I'M THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY-

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:21.174
REGARD TO- ADDING THAT

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:23.676
ADDITIONAL BASKETS WORRYING

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:25.245
ASPECT OF THE WORK THAT THE SEC

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.647
WOULD BE DRAWING- IS THAT THERE

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.916
THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF A

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:32.352
RELATIONSHIP CHANGE THAT AND- IS

01:51:32.419 --> 01:51:33.853
THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT- SOME

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.257
OTHER ENTITY I'M NOT SURE. BUT-

01:51:37.323 --> 01:51:38.992
I THINK THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:41.094
THAT WE DO HAVE NOW WITH THE SEC

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:42.962
AND GIVEN THE SUPPORT THAT WE

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:44.664
CAN PROVIDE TO FACILITIES ONCE

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:47.233
LIKE THINGS ARE UNIFIED- I THINK

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.136
IT'S- IT'S BEEN. AFFECTED BUT OF

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:51.838
COURSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PLACES

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:54.541
WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE AND DO SOME

01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:59.279
MORE. THANK YOU CHIEF WELL THANK

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:01.514

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:09.089
COMPLICATED. ISSUE AND TO THAT

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.224
END BRINGING THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.593
TOGETHER TO REALLY TAKE A LONG

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.628
HARD LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.230
NEEDED AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.898
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD FIND

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:20.233
ITSELF INTO LEGISLATION I THINK

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.068
IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:23.736

THINGS THAT COULD BE HAPPENING

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:40.112
THERE YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:41.214
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DATA COULD

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:44.250
HELP TO HELP TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.319
KINDS OF THINGS CAN IN JAILS

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:48.855
BENEFIT FROM. OUR SOME OF THE

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.456

AMOUNTS ARE OUR BIGGER FACILITY

01:59:13.579 --> 01:59:16.749
RIGHT SO I THINK LOOKING AT BACK

HUNDRED DOWN. TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:21.554
KINDS OF THINGS R. THE JAILS

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:22.989
WILL BE BEFORE WE DON'T SEE

GOING RIGHT WHAT ARE THEY DOING

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:31.063
THAT OTHER FACILITIES WILL NOT

01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:32.865
BE DOING. BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:35.601
THAT'S THE ROLE OF YES. IS TAKE

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:39.972

UPSIDE LOWER- AMONGST THE- AND

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:57.323
SO. I THINK THE BSE'S CARE- YEAH

THE SERVER DATA OF THE FROM.

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:03.029
WHICH CAN ALLOW FOR. IT LOCATION

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:04.830
IDEAS ENTERED IN EVIDENCE

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:06.632
RECEIVING ALCOHOL- TO BE ABLE

REQUIRED. THE JAILS PROVIDE SO

02:00:25.117 --> 02:00:27.386
THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

THINGS THAT ARE WORKING. TO THE

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:31.090
BEST OF THEIR ABILITY AND THEN

WITH THAT INFORMATION THE SEC

02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:36.028

02:00:36.095 --> 02:00:38.864
ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:40.132
ADMINISTER ARE. YOU KNOW

THAT WAS GOOD I BELIEVE

02:00:54.146 --> 02:00:55.615
EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO HEAR THAT

THANK YOU SO MUCH- SUPERVISOR

THAT QUESTION IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:10.463
ONE US SENATOR AND- AND LET ME

02:01:10.529 --> 02:01:12.131
JUST GIVE A COUPLE OF. BROAD

02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:13.966
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:14.734
INFORMATION I THINK THAT WOULD

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.369
BE HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:18.571
AGAIN LOOKING BOTH AT PARTICULAR

02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:20.840
FACILITIES BUT ALSO STATEWIDE.

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:24.043
ONE IS THAT RIGHT NOW- AS YOU

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:26.045
ALL KNOW. THE PEOPLE WHO COME

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:27.546
INTO CUSTODY FOR THE MOST PART

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.815
ARE RELATIVELY UNHEALTHY- FROM A

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:31.684
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE. AND

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:33.753
KNOWING WHAT SOMEONE'S HEALTH IS

02:01:33.819 --> 02:01:36.055
WHEN THEY ENTER- AND WHETHER OR

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:38.190
NOT THEIR HEALTH IS. WHAT KINDS

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:40.259
OF SERVICES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:41.861
ACCESS. IS REALLY CRITICAL SO

02:01:41.927 --> 02:01:43.896
FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT ARE THE TOTAL

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:45.164
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY GET MENTAL

02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:46.966
HEALTH SCREENINGS HOW MANY OF

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:48.701
THEM END UP WITH THE DIAGNOSIS

02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:50.369
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE GETTING

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:53.005
MEDICATION. YOU KNOW I THAT THAT

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:54.473
ALL OF THAT INFORMATION WILL

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.941
HELP US UNDERSTAND BOTH THE

02:01:56.008 --> 02:01:58.544
POPULATIONS THAT ARE COMING IN.

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:00.179
HOW BETTER TO STRUCTURE THAT

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:03.916
THE- EM MEDICAL SERVICES THAT

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:05.951
ARE NOW. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:06.852
SERVICES ARE IN A WAY THAT

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:09.355
REALLY DO GIVE PEOPLE THE BEST

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:10.256
OPPORTUNITY FOR AGAIN NOT TO

02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:12.358
RECEIVE A- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:13.526
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE SEEN

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:15.494
EVEN LOCALLY IS THAT- THERE ARE

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:16.996
SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT HALF

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:18.731
FIVE. BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS IN

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:20.800
THE JAIL HAS ACCESS TO THE TO

02:02:20.866 --> 02:02:21.901
THE INFORMATION THAT COULD HELP

02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:23.669
THEM ACTUALLY SUPPORT PEOPLE. ON

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:25.805
THEIR WAY OUT AND SO THOSE ARE

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.740
THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT IF WE

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:28.908
IF WE WERE ABLE TO GATHER DATA

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:31.711
BOTH SPECIFIC INSTITUTE. WHAT

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:33.879
THE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND THEN

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:34.714
BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW TO

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:35.881
UTILIZE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:37.950
WE'RE LOWERING RECIDIVISM AS AN

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.152
EXAMPLE- ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT I

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:41.620
THOUGHT THE L. A- REACHED OUT

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:42.855
THAT. THEN I THOUGHT WAS

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:44.156
INTERESTING WAS REPORTING ON

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:46.292
DEATHS IN A MORE ROBUST WAY. I

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:47.493
THINK REPORTING TO THE ATTORNEY

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.561
GENERAL OR SOMEWHERE THAT REALLY

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.896
DOES MAKE. THAT ADD SUNSHINE TO

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:53.332
THAT. IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AND

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:54.900
PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT I

02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:57.536
THINK IS THAT IF EVERYBODY HAS

02:02:57.603 --> 02:02:59.071
TO. HAVE REPORTS THAT ARE

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:00.573
CONSISTENT AND CLEAR. AND

02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:02.708
OPPORTUNITY TO THE LOOKOUT WHAT

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:04.577
ARE THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:06.078
MADE IN EACH FACILITY. AND THEN

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:07.513
IN AGGREGATE WHAT ARE THE

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.315
CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:10.149
THINKING ABOUT. ON THAT WILL

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.350
IMPROVE THE- SAFETY AND WELL

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:13.319
BEING OF THOSE ARC STUDIO CARE

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:16.322
AND AGAIN. YEAH WELL THE MEASURE

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:17.890
THE INPUTS WE HAVE WHAT THE

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:21.627
RECIDIVIST. I'M OUT. THANK YOU

02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:25.297
OUR CHIEF MILLS. THANK YOU AT

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:27.666
THE CENTER CALM WATER FOR THE

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.735
FOR THE QUESTION AND I. IN MY

02:03:29.802 --> 02:03:32.071
SENSE WE NEED A DATE AT TWO

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:34.440
LEVELS ONE IS AT THE MACRO LEVEL

02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:36.275
WHAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE WHERE

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:38.611
THE TRENDS. ARE THERE ARE

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:40.246
CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:03:40.312 --> 02:03:41.781
IN HOUSE THAT IMPACT THE LOCAL

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:44.517
FACILITY AND THEN AT THE MICRO

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:47.319
LEVEL. WE ALSO NEED. BETTER DATA

02:03:47.386 --> 02:03:49.588
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:03:49.655 --> 02:03:51.824
INSIDE FACILITIES THERE'S- A

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:53.726
SERIES OF USES OF FORCE IS FOR

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:56.762
INSTANCE ON. INMATES WIRELESS

02:03:56.829 --> 02:03:58.764
TAKING PLACE AND WHAT IS THAT

02:03:58.831 --> 02:03:59.698
DATA LOOK LIKE ARE WE EVEN

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.634
CAPTURING THE RIGHT DATA AND UP

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:03.135
MY I'M SUSPICIOUS THAT WERE

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:05.171
PROBABLY NOT. I CAPTURE THE

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:08.741
RIGHT DATA. SO I SEE THE DATA

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.810
NEED TO COME OUT AT TWO

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:12.678
DIFFERENT LEVELS. FOR INSTANCE I

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:15.881
WAS MENTIONED BY CHIEF HAYNES-

02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:18.250
THE- BY THE JAILS THE LOCAL

02:04:18.317 --> 02:04:20.419
JAILS HAVE BECOME THE LARGEST

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:23.255
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN THE

02:04:23.322 --> 02:04:25.257
STATE. IN TRYING TO RUN A

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:28.394
FACILITY WHERE THAT IS PRESENT

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.363
AND ALONG WITH THE ENORMOUS

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.933
ADDICTION PROBLEMS. THAT IS

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.935
WHERE WE NEED THE INFORMATION TO

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:37.636
BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE BEST

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:39.505
WAY TO RUN THESE FACILITIES SO

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:40.706
THAT WHEN WE PROMULGATE A

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:44.310
REGULATION THAT ALLOWS US TO. BE

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:45.444
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:47.646
AT. AND THEN THE LAST PART OF

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.782
THAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT IS

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:54.353
NEEDED- IS WHAT WHAT COUNTIES

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.721
ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:57.289
THEY REPORT OUT FOR INSTANCE

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:58.891
DURING COVERED THEIR WORDS THERE

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.826
WERE DEPARTMENTS JUST CHOSE NOT

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:02.595
TO GIVE THE INFORMATION AND THAT

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:04.964
CANNOT E ACCEPTABLE AND NOT IN

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:07.867
A STATE BUT- BSE IS POWERLESS TO

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:10.102
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT OTHER THAN

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:11.503
TO NOTATE IT. AND ALLOW THE

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:12.638
DECISION MAKERS WHICH ARE THE

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:13.973
PEOPLE ON THE COUNTIES PEOPLE

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:16.675
LIKE TO THE SHERIFF'S I DO HAVE

02:05:16.742 --> 02:05:17.776
THAT INFORMATION IF THEY CHOOSE

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:20.246
TO SEEK IT OUT I SAID THEY CAN

02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.181
MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHAT

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.349
pKIND OF LEADERS. DO THEY WANT

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:27.319
PLACE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:30.189
THINK. I AGREE THERE SHOULD BE

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:34.693
ARM. MUCH MORE TEETH THAT YOU

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.131
ALL HAVE I MEAN I YOU KNOW. YOU

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:42.034
CAN HAVE STANDARDS- BUT YOU ALSO

02:05:42.101 --> 02:05:43.769
HAVE TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES IF

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:46.739
THINGS AREN'T BEING FOLLOWED-

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:49.608
AND SO I AGREED THAT WE SHOULD

02:05:49.675 --> 02:05:51.577
BE LOOKING AT GIVING THE BOARD

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:54.980
GREATER AUTHORITY- A END. I

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:59.051
THINK SOME CONCERN IS. WOULD

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:01.053
THIS GIVEN THE MAKEUP OF THE

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.655
BOARD IS THIS A BOARD THAT CAN

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:07.326
LEVY- YOU KNOW ENFORCEMENT THE

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:10.195
AND CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS- TO

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:12.064
COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW THE FOLKS

02:06:12.131 --> 02:06:13.966
KIND OF FROM THE SAME STRIPES

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.701
AND SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.670
BE HOPEFULLY IS THAT THE-

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:20.172
HOPEFULLY YOU ALL ARE HAVING OR

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:21.540
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:23.108
AROUND THAT. BECAUSE WHEN WE

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:25.344
TALK ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE YOU

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:27.713
KNOW THAT'S ALSO A PART OF IT.

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.415
YOU KNOW MY SECOND QUESTION

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:31.083
REALLY STEMS FROM THAT AND IT'S

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:34.887
SPECIFIC TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY-

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:37.456
I THINK- A SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:39.024
MENTIONED THAT YOU GET

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:41.026
INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY FROM DOING

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:41.894
LOTS OF READING AND THERE ARE

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.729
TONS OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES THAT

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.698
HAVE COME OUT ABOUT WHAT'S

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:47.099
HAPPENING IN OUR L. A. COUNTY

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.867
JAILS. I HAVE ONE HERE THAT WAS

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:52.137
DONE MAYBE JUST A WEEK OR SO AGO

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:53.839
THAT. TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:56.308
HUMILIATING STRIP SEARCHES AND

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:57.910
PUNCHING INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN

02:06:57.977 --> 02:07:00.779
THE HEAD AND HAVING FOLKS WALK

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:03.148
AROUND. YOU KNOW WITHOUT.

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:06.952
UNDERWEAR OR SHOES YOU KNOW-

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:10.789
STILL USING THE RAP DEVICE-

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:14.360
WHICH IT IS THIS IS A CONTINUING

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:15.127
PRACTICE SHOULD CANNOT BE

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:19.732
JUSTIFIED- AND SO. IF FOLKS ARE

02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:21.800
NOT I MEAN SO WHAT IS GOING ON

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:22.868
IT'S REALLY THE QUESTION WHAT IS

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:24.837
GOING ON AND WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:26.905
BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENCE THAT

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:29.808
WHILE ARM. SHARESARE PART OF A

02:07:29.875 --> 02:07:31.210
LOCAL SYSTEM IN THE JAIL AS PART

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:33.012
OF A LOCAL SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE A

02:07:33.078 --> 02:07:34.813
LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IT

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.915
ALSO SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:39.351
ENTITIES NEED SOME HELP FROM THE

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:42.488
STATE. AND SO. I MEAN WHAT ARE

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:46.959
YOUR THOUGHTS. DO YOU ARE LET'S

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:49.728
PICK A PERSON I. LET LET YOU

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.597
KNOW I IT'S SO HARD WE HAVE A

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:53.565
COURT REPORTER WHO TRANSIT IN

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.768
NAMES AND SO LET ME DO LET ME

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:58.137
JUST STEP RIGHT IN AND-

02:07:58.203 --> 02:08:00.406
SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ IT ANYTHING

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:02.307
YOU WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:03.675
THIS AND THEN I'LL O TO CHIEF

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:07.446
MILLS AND THEN- CHIEF PAINS.

02:08:07.513 --> 02:08:09.181
YES- YOU KNOW I. AS CENTER COME

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:11.183
UNDER I THINK THAT THE FIRST

02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:12.518
QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT WHETHER

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:14.686
OR NOT WE CAN HOLD EACH OTHER

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:17.523
ACCOUNTABLE. IS A FAIR QUESTION

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:20.159
LIKE AND I AND I WILL SAY I'VE

02:08:20.225 --> 02:08:22.327
I'VE- BEEN ON THE BOARD. FOR A

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:25.030
VERY SHORT TIME MY OBSERVATION

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.065
IS THAT BOTH MYSELF AND MY

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:28.367
COLLEAGUES TO DO THAT. I THINK

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:30.502
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT-

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:31.703
WHEN YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO BE

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:34.173
OUT OF WORK LIKE THIS THAT YOU

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:34.940
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.242
IMPLICATIONS OF IT IS THAT

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:38.410
YOU'RE GOING TO BE- YOU. YOU YOU

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:39.878
ARE GETTING IN THERE BECAUSE YOU

02:08:39.945 --> 02:08:41.380
THINK THINGS CAN BE BETTER. AND

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:42.714
YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARD ON

02:08:42.781 --> 02:08:44.783
THAT AND YOU YOU WANT TO BE

02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:46.885
HEARD ON THAT SO THAT THAT'S ONE

02:08:46.952 --> 02:08:47.953
THING I WOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.188
ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK.

02:08:49.254 --> 02:08:51.023
THE OTHER IS THAT THE IMPORTANCE

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:52.591
OF HAVING THE TWO FOLKS ON THE

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:54.426
BOARD THAT HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:55.060
IS REALLY CRITICAL. TO SHEDDING

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:56.261
LIGHT AND REALLY REINFORCING

02:08:56.328 --> 02:08:58.497
WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. I DO WANT

02:08:58.564 --> 02:08:59.131
TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:01.600
LIMITATIONS OF THE SEC'S.

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.702
AUTHORITY AND I THINK THAT'S

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:05.437
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:09:05.504 --> 02:09:07.906
DISCUSSING- OF YOU KNOW. BACK

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.975
AND FORTH I. YOU KNOW AS TO

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:11.143
WHAT'S HAPPENING SPECIFICALLY IN

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:13.579
LOS ANGELES THANK YOU KNOW MY

02:09:13.645 --> 02:09:16.081
INFORMATION IS REALLY MORE FROM-

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:18.016
FROM READING AND I WILL JUST

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:20.018
MAKE ONE OBSERVATION. THAT THE

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.520
PRODUCTS ARE PATIENT AND IT'S

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.622
OBVIOUS THAT THEIR- THEIR

02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:24.756
SUFFERING AND THAT THEY'RE IN

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:27.359
TROUBLE AND THAT IN I DON'T I

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.760
DON'T MEAN. WITH ANYBODY I MEAN

02:09:28.827 --> 02:09:31.797
THAT THERE'S TROUBLE OUT THERE.

02:09:31.864 --> 02:09:32.998
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:34.066
ABSOLUTELY THAT THERE'S A WALL

02:09:34.133 --> 02:09:36.969
BOTH FOR. THE FCC TO WAIT AGAIN.

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:38.337
AND FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT

02:09:38.403 --> 02:09:41.006
WHETHER OR NOT THE KEY WORDS

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:43.675
THAT COME OUT OF THE- THE

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:44.977
INVEST. ONE IT SHOULD BE LIKE

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:46.712
JUST IT AND I'LL JUST GIVE AN

02:09:46.778 --> 02:09:48.680
EXAMPLE OF WHERE THEY ARE THAT

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:50.682
MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY AND MAYBE.

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.084
OR NOT. SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THE-

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:54.153
ELLIE OCI EVALUATE. SORRY AUDIT

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:55.988
OF. GO ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:57.923
STRUCK BY WAS I THOUGHT OH THIS

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.691
IS A GREAT RECOMMENDATION ON.

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:01.760
HOW WE REPORT GAS. PUTTING THAT

02:10:01.827 --> 02:10:02.828
IN THE HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY

02:10:02.895 --> 02:10:04.396
GENERAL FOR MAKING THAT PUBLIC.

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:06.298
I LOOKED AT THE MEDICAL

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:06.965
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE QUESTION

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.433
I HAD WAS. WHAT WOULD MEDICAL

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.102
PROFESSIONALS SAY ABOUT THIS

02:10:10.169 --> 02:10:12.070
COMPONENT OF IT. AND SO I'M NOT

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:14.006
SURE WHICH OF THOSE PIECES NEEDS

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:17.142
TO BE EMBEDDED IN LEGISLATION

02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.743
BECAUSE YOU'D ALWAYS FIND. OUT

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:21.146
THE- BEST PRACTICES. EIGHT AND

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:23.649
SO. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:10:23.715 --> 02:10:25.717
THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE

02:10:25.784 --> 02:10:27.586
CASES THAT WE NEED TO DIVE IN AS

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:28.787
DEEP AS WE- CAN. SO THAT THE

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:32.124
SOLUTIONS. THAT WE SEE. CAN BE

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:33.091
PROPERLY DETERMINED WHAT SHOULD

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:35.160
BE LEGISLATIVE. WHAT SHOULD BE A

02:10:35.227 --> 02:10:40.599
DIFFERENT KIND. OF PRACTICE I

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:41.833
DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.536
I WOULD ONE. I WANT TO GET MORE

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:45.804
THOUGHT TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:49.341
FOR THE- SORRY CHIEF MILLS. YES

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:52.010
THANK YOU- I THINK WE'RE ALL

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:53.478
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:56.582
CONDITIONS AND THE L. A. COUNTY

02:10:56.648 --> 02:11:00.085
SYSTEM BOTH AT THE I'D AT THE

02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:01.653
JAIL LEVELS WELLS THAT YOU'VE IN

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.189
ALL LEVELS ARE THESE ARE-

02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:05.824
SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES I KNOW IT'S

02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:08.026
BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:10.562
I HAVE I MY TENURE ON THE BSE

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:12.664
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN THAT LONG IT

02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:14.933
JUST FEW YEARS. THIS IS BEEN THE

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.603
STRONGEST YES THIS YEAR HAS BEEN

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.471
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HOLD A

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:21.540
SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE I THINK THAT

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:24.276
THERE IS A LACK OF AUTHORITY TO

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:27.446
ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:29.815
HOWEVER- BECAUSE THIS IS A

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:32.484
DEMOCRACY IN AND THE- SHERIFF

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:34.486
WAS ELECTED I THINK THAT THERE

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:36.555
IS SOME- RIGHT THAT GOES WITH

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:38.991
THAT. HOWEVER WHEN YOU'RE SEEING

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:41.326
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT IS WHEN

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:43.462
THE STATE SHOULD STEP IN. THAT

02:11:43.528 --> 02:11:45.864
IS WHEN THE STATE SHOULD- HOLD

02:11:45.931 --> 02:11:48.166
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE NOT WHATEVER

02:11:48.233 --> 02:11:49.001
FORMAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I AM NOT

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:52.437
SURE- BUT I THAT COULD BE GIVEN

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:55.641
TO THE BSE AS LONG AS THE-

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:58.143
ABILITY TO DO IT. IS ALL THAT

02:11:58.210 --> 02:11:59.945
GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THE LAST

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:02.581
THING I THINK THAT IT'S

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:03.915
IMPORTANT TO MENTION IS. PEOPLE

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:07.519
CONFUSE THE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM.

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:10.289
WITH THE CAPACITY IN THE ABILITY

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:12.457
OF THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM. I

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:13.959
WE'VE MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:15.794
IN THE STATE TO BE

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:17.663
INSTITUTIONALIZED PRESENCE I

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:21.566
THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE- MMHM

02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:25.404
PROCEDURE AND AN ID IDEOLOGY

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:27.773
HOWEVER THE EXECUTION OF IT IS

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:30.008
VERY IMPORTANT ADD TO

02:12:30.075 --> 02:12:31.410
INCARCERATE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE

02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:32.744
IN A IN A STATE PENAL

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:35.347
INSTITUTION FOR YOU KNOW FOR

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:36.148
YEARS KEEPING AMANDA AT THE

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:39.451
LOCAL LEVEL HAS REALLY MADE A

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:40.452
VERY COMPLEX AND MORE COMPLEX

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:42.321
THAN IT NEEDS TO BE SO THAT IS

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:43.989
PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:46.925
NEED TO CONSIDER. AND TO THINK

02:12:46.992 --> 02:12:49.628
THROUGH AS WE DO THAT- BECAUSE

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:51.430
IT IS OVERWHELMING I THINK FOR

02:12:51.496 --> 02:12:53.699
MAYBE THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS-

02:12:53.765 --> 02:12:55.067
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:58.670
CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY A SMALL

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:03.175
CYMBALS PROBLEMS. THANK YOU

02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:07.346
CHIEF CHIEF HAYNES. THANK YOU.

THE- I APPRECIATE CHIEF MILLS WE

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:35.374
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE L. A.

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.042
COUNTY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE BECAUSE

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:39.010
OF COURT THAT I MADE OUR LAST

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:42.147
YES YOU SEE IT. IS THAT. YOU

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:43.548
KNOW THE THINGS THAT ARE

02:13:43.615 --> 02:13:45.150
HAPPENING IN LOS ALAMOS LOS

02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:46.685
ANGELES BOTH MEN IN THE ADULT

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:48.253
SYSTEM AND IN THE IN OUR DOUBLE

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.123
FAULT IS THAT IT'S ON EXCEPT-

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:43.561
CATEGORIES OF FOLKS. I'M COMING

02:31:46.163 --> 02:31:48.365
QUESTIONS AROUND SAN DIEGO WHEN

WE GOT THE AUDIT REPORT- THAT

RESPONSIBLE FOR AND IT'S CLEAR

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:02.980
WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN THIS

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:05.282
AREA. BECAUSE I THINK THE LINES

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:07.918
OF RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:09.119
WHETHER YOU HAVE ACTUAL

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:11.856
AUTHORITY IN THE ROLE HERE AT

02:32:11.922 --> 02:32:15.893
THIS BOARD OF BECAME. A LITTLE

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:19.430
MORE IN CENTER FOCUS IF YOU WILL

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:20.965
WHICH IS WHY YOU GOT THE

02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:22.633
QUESTIONS ABOUT SAN DIEGO I KNOW

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:23.634
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT L. A.

02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:26.937
N. AND OTHERS BUT THERE WAS-

02:32:27.004 --> 02:32:28.739
QUITE A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:31.509
EXTENSIVE MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF WHAT

02:32:31.575 --> 02:32:33.544
WAS GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO AND

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.679
THOSE OF US REPRESENT THE AREA.

02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:38.349
MERCEDES BENZ WITH PEOPLE BEFORE

02:32:38.415 --> 02:32:41.151
ALL BEFORE THAT AUDIT OCCURRED-

02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:42.620
AND SO I THINK THERE'S STILL

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:45.222
WORK TO DO THERE I KNOW IN YOUR

02:32:45.289 --> 02:32:47.725

A MEETING IN APRIL- AND I AND I

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:52.029
DO THINK THERE'S BEEN

02:32:52.096 --> 02:32:53.931
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:57.368
THE QUESTION ASK ARE ALSO. I DO

02:32:57.434 --> 02:32:59.136
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:01.005
AUTHORITY WHAT SHOULD IT BE

02:33:01.071 --> 02:33:02.406
SHOULD THERE BE ENFORCEMENT I

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:04.041
KNOW CHIEF MILLS YOU GET ASKED

02:33:04.108 --> 02:33:05.809
THAT QUESTION AT LEAST TWICE WE

02:33:05.876 --> 02:33:10.447
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- BUT- I THINK

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:11.849
THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE WORK

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:14.451
THAT COMES OUT OF THIS AUDIT.

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:17.821
AND OTHERS THAT MAY- MEAN THAT

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.056
THERE WILL BE LEGISLATIVE

02:33:19.123 --> 02:33:22.426
CONSIDERATION FOR. THIS BODY TO

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:24.128
TAKE ON MORE OF A ROLE AND I

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:25.629
WOULD JUST. I DON'T HAVE A

02:33:25.696 --> 02:33:27.131

02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:31.268
AS YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS.

02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:34.038
ARE AT UPCOMING BOARDS BECAUSE

02:33:34.104 --> 02:33:36.907
SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING- YOU

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:39.443

02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:43.447
COMMUNITY FOR YOUR JAIL. OF WHO

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:45.716

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:47.117
HUNDRED EIGHTY DEATHS. IN A

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:50.354
PERIOD OF TIME- AND THAT SOMEHOW

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:52.890
BETWEEN THE INSPECTIONS. AND THE

02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:57.294
ANALYSIS OF TRAINING OF STAFF-

02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:01.565
WE SOMEHOW. MISSED AN ABILITY

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.767
AND I HAVE TO SAY COLLECTIVELY-

02:34:03.834 --> 02:34:05.803
MISSED AN ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT

02:34:05.869 --> 02:34:08.038
WHAT TO DO THERE. AND YOU ARE

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:09.373
EXPERTS IN YOUR VARIOUS FIELDS

02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:12.076
AND YOU SERVE FOR A PURPOSE AND

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:13.377
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE THAT WORK

02:34:13.444 --> 02:34:14.979
IN THE JAILS AND THERE ARE GOOD

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:17.414
INTENTIONS BUT SOMETHING DID NOT

02:34:17.481 --> 02:34:20.117
GO. WELL AT ALL FOR THIS TO

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:23.287
HAPPEN. AND A PART OF IT IS JAIL

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:25.522
SHOULD NOT BE FACILITIES THAT

02:34:25.589 --> 02:34:27.691
ARE. HAVING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:30.027
THE MEDICAL NEEDS BUT SOMEHOW.

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:32.329
IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME THAT

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:34.131
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:34:34.198 --> 02:34:36.600
RESOURCES NEED TO BE THERE. TO

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:38.268
PROTECT. THOSE WHO WERE

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:41.739
INCARCERATED- IN TO SUPPORT THE

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.974
STAFF THAT WORK THERE SO I'M

02:34:44.041 --> 02:34:46.410
JUST GONNA NOT BARRAGED WITH

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:47.845
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK THE

02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:49.413
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED BUT

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.582
ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

02:34:51.649 --> 02:34:53.684
AND BE PREPARED TO GIVE US

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:55.452

02:35:10.801 --> 02:35:12.970
GIVE US THE FEEDBACK AND SO I

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:15.039
WOULD JUST ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:16.940
IS OF EACH OF YOU ARE YOU

02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:18.208
WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO

02:35:18.275 --> 02:35:19.743
RESOLVE SOME OF THESE OBVIOUSLY

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:24.114
GAPS. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED-

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:25.082
AND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHOSE

02:35:25.149 --> 02:35:26.684
ROLE IS IT BECAUSE I BE HONEST

WITH YOU I HAD I HAD

02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:29.119
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY

02:35:29.186 --> 02:35:30.788
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEY FELT

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:33.724
LIKE IT WAS NOT THEIR ROLE- IN

02:35:33.791 --> 02:35:36.393

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.861
WANNA. I DON'T AND YOU TO BE

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:39.897

THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A

02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:43.767
CONVERSATION BUT- ALSO I THINK

02:35:43.834 --> 02:35:45.335
PART OF IT RECOGNIZING THE ROLE

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:47.705
OF AN ELECTED SHERIFF. I WAS A

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:49.039
PIECE OF THAT CONVERSATION SO

02:35:49.106 --> 02:35:50.140
SOMEHOW WE'VE GOT TO BRING

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:51.975
THESE. CONVERSATIONS MORE

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.477
ALIGNED AND HAVE A DIALOGUE

02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:56.380

IN TERMS OF THE FACILITIES AND

02:36:03.787 --> 02:36:06.090
NOT JUST A LIE BUT A FEW OTHERS.

02:36:06.156 --> 02:36:08.292
BUT WE REALLY NEED TO BE TALKING

02:36:08.358 --> 02:36:09.827
MORE ABOUT HOW BEST TO THAT AND

02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:12.296
YOU ARE THE EXPERTS- YOU ARE THE

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:13.997

AFTER YOU SIT THROUGH THE AUDIT.

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:35.719
