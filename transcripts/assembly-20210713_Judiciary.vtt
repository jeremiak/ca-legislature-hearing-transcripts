AS LONG AS THERE'S A PROCESS

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:52.243
AND THAT THE- CHAIR OF THE

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.577
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:56.180
COMFORTABLE TO PROCESS THAT. I

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:56.780
DO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IF WE

MOVE THE BILL TODAY. THAT THOSE

00:41:58.515 --> 00:41:59.817
DISCUSSIONS WILL STILL GO ON

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.719

TIME IT COMES TO THE FLOOR TO

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:07.925
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SO

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.927
I. I DO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:11.362
SENATE'S CONCERNS FOR A LACK OF

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.630
CHIEF PROCK COUNCIL WE HAVE

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:13.864
SEEN THIS COMMITTEE. HAS BEEN

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.633
HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE BAR OVER

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:18.402
THE YEARS. AND THEIR INABILITY

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.069
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:21.772
THAT'S THE ROLE OF CHIEF TRIAL

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:22.406
COUNSEL I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:25.009
OF. THE EMPLOYEES AT THE BAR

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:29.013
WHO ARE. EARLY RECENT HIRES

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.614
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.182
WHO ARE DOING THE PROSECUTION'S

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.217
AND THEY ARE DEAD SERIOUS ABOUT

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.618
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I TOLD

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.287
THEM AS I TOLD THE BAR TRUSTEES

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.888
I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.456
ATTORNEYS ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:40.691
WHEN THEY GET A CALL FROM THE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:42.459
BAR AND THAT. WE UP THE

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:45.296
STANDARD. OF THAT LEVEL OF

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.932
PROTECTION AND THAT. THAT

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.700
CONCERN THAT ATTORNEYS SHOULD

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:52.303
HAVE FOR BEING HAVING THEIR

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:54.138
CONDUCT RVIEWED BY THE STATE

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:56.040
BAR THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:57.141
WE I THINK COLLECTIVELY ALONG

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.876
WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:01.245
ARE TRYING TO. TO DO SO THAT IS

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:02.546
WHY I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:04.181
PASSED THE BILL HERE TODAY WE

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.082

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.099
IN TERMS OF INDIGENT

REPRESENTATION WE MAY JUST HAVE

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.036
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. THE

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.504
FOLKS THAT REPRESENT INDIGENTS

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.773
LARGELY AGREE WITH US. OTHERS

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.509
DISAGREE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:41.844

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:42.578
MANY OF US PARTICULARLY DURING

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:44.947
THIS TIME PERIOD- I THINK WE

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.688
AND- I THINK RESOLVING THIS IS

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.623
IMPORTANT. MY HOPE IS I THINK

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.258
THE EXAMPLE YOU JUST GAVE IS A-

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.594

SOMEONE WHO'S LOWER INCOME

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:00.362
COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THAT

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.830
I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.732
MAYBE PRESCRIBE TO THAT BUT-

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:04.466

JOURNEYS I FELT LIKE THEY WERE

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.943
VERY- THIS WORKS FOR EVERYBODY

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.744
THAT'S WHAT THEY KEPT SAYING

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:49.978
THIS IS GREAT IT WORKS FOR

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:50.679
EVERYBODY WELL IF IT DOESN'T

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.581
WORK FOR THE WORKERS DOING. THE

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.116
JOB IT DOESN'T WORK FOR

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:55.951
EVERYBODY. AND SO I JUST WANT

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.486
TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.720
MOVING FORWARD THE INTERPRETERS

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.389
IN PARTICULAR I'M NOT SURE HOW

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.224
THIS CAN WORK. WE JUST SAW I

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.825
MEAN WITH THE TESTIMONY WHAT

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.295
HAPPENS OBVIOUSLY IN REMOTE

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.897
SETTINGS- AND I'M GOING TO

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:09.531
ASSUME THAT THE COURTS. ARE IN

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.466
A BETTER POSITION TO MANAGE

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.868
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:15.771
CONTINUE TO SEE. THEM I CATCH

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:19.274
MAYBE. FOUR FIFTHS OF THE WORDS

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.777
THAT ARE SAID- AND I'M VERY

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.812
CONSCIENTIOUS OF THAT BECAUSE

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.347
I'M DYSLEXIC AND WHEN I READ

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.949
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT I READ AT THE

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.684
SAME TIME ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS AND

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.985
I HAVE TO GO BACK AND GO BACK

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:32.454
IF YOU CAN'T GO BACK IT MAKES

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.623
IT REALLY HARD TO PROCESS-

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.491
EXACT INFORMATION AND SOME OF

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:37.392
THE STORIES I HEARD FROM COURT

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.928
REPORTERS- IT REALLY BASED ON

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:41.663
GETTING PIECES IN TRYING TO

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.698
INTERRUPT AND SAY I DIDN'T HEAR

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.066
ANYTHING AND BEING DISREGARDED

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.934
AGAIN WHICH I BELIEVE GIVEN.

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:46.401
HOW MUCH THEY'VE BEEN

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:48.203
DISREGARDED BY SOME IN THIS

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.338
CONVERSATION THAT THAT PROBABLY

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:50.672
DOES HAPPEN TO THEM YOU KNOW I

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.140
CAN'T HEAR AND PEOPLE KEEP

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.343
GOING SOUTH I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.978
THAT WERE- TAKING THEIR

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.980
CONCERNS SERIOUSLY AND-

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.781
ADDRESSING THEM IN WHATEVER

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:02.017
FORM AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.318
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT-

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:06.722
CONVENIENCE DOESN'T SUPERSEDE

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.491
AT WHAT REALLY SHOULD BE- THE

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.293
NUMBER ONE CONCERN WITH IT

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.261
WHICH IS AN ACCURATE RECORD-

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:14.997
INTERPRETING WHICH IS MAKING

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.198
SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.232
GOING ON IN THEIR LANGUAGE OF

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.935
CHOICE. IN THE COURTROOM SO-

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:23.638
BUT I DO GIVE YOU MUCH CREDIT

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:24.239
TO TAKE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.841
THAT WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE A

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.242
BACKLOG AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.144
TO GET THROUGH IT SO- KUDOS TO

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.412
YOU FOR TAKING THE PHONE I LOOK

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.947
FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:35.517
YOU SPECIFICALLY. ON THOSE ON

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.119
TWO ISSUES. I THANK YOU OTHER

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:41.723
QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ISRAEL

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:45.527
THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO I WANT

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.062
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.296
SEIU I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:50.298
IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:54.036
THE VERY WORKERS FOR DOING THE

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.003
FOR. WE DO KNOW THAT THIS

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.705
PANDEMIC IS SHOWN THAT WE DO

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:57.239
NEED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.174
DIFFERENT. TO HAVING TO TAKE

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:03.211
THE SUN IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:05.847
THE INTERPRETERS UNFORTUNATELY

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:06.982
WITH THEIR TESTIMONY WAS VERY

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:08.750
IMPORTANT I DIDN'T SEE A LETTER

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:11.186
OF OPPOSITION. SO I HAD NO

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.755
CONTEXT IN THAT REGARD TO WITH

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.290
THE COMMENTS WERE VERY

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:17.692
IMPORTANT- I THINK THAT WITH

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.895
OUR OUR COURT REPORTERS HAVING

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:23.231
THEM WITH THE HEARING OFFICER

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:25.133
THE JUDGE. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.735
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:29.004
IT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN. BECAUSE

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.439
THAT IS- SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:33.542
BE. THE CORNERSTONE OF WHAT WE

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.743
DO IS ATTORNEYS MAKING SURE

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.311
THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.747
BETWEEN THE HEARING OFFICER AND

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:39.748
THE CORE PART OF MAKING SURE

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:40.282
THAT WE HAVE AN ACCURATE

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:43.952
RECORD. OF BUT AGAIN I AT MOST

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.120
IMPORTANTLY I THINK HAVING YOU

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.989
WORK IN THE SPACE AND ENGAGING

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.125
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.127
HAVE- I THINK. IT LENDS FOR

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.495
BETTER LEGISLATION BUT I KNOW

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.997
THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER STEPS

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:59.734
ALONG THE WAY. AND I AM GLAD.

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.103
AGAIN FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:03.438
ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.606
VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AT

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:07.075
THIS THE COURT ORDERS AND NOW

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.310
HEARING THE INTERPRETERS OF

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:13.849
BLOOD BUT THEY. DID CALL AND-

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:17.419
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:20.489
SIX. THE CHAIRMAN- YOU KNOW ONE

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:24.526
ONE ISSUE THAT CAME UP- I THINK

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.495
FROM THE COURT RECORDS IS A

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:31.733
COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION IS-

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.001
THE REGISTRATION IS ONE THING I

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.302
THINK THAT DOES PROVIDE THE

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:37.038
OVERSIGHT AND SUPERVISION- BUT

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:37.973
THEY WERE SAYING THAT THE

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.608
CURRENT STATUTE AS IT'S DRAFTED

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:42.210
APPLIES MOSTLY TO SITUATIONS

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.912
WHERE WE'RE A LICENSED

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:46.014
CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER IS

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.917
THE OWNER- OF THE BUSINESS AND

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:51.586
SO- THE ASSOCIATION IS

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:52.854
CONCERNED THERE MAY BE GAPS IN

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.990
THAT STATUTE. THAT COULD BE

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:56.658
USED BY KIND OF THE OUT OF

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.392
STATE CORPORATIONS TO GET

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.661
AROUND. THE CURRENT STATUTORY

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.497
STRUCTURE. AND MAYBE AND MAYBE

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.598
THEY SAY THEY'RE APPLYING OR

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.766
THEY'LL SAY THAT THAT STATUTE

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.702
DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. BECAUSE

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.437
THE SHORT THE CERTIFIED

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:10.038
SHORTHAND REPORTER IS NOT THE

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.940
OWNER. AS A COULD YOU MAY

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:12.774
RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.944
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;ONCERNS CENTER. SO WE WILL&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:16.878
CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.214
THAT THE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:21.416
THAT. IF YOU'RE AN OUT OF STATE

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.118
REPORTER REPORTING IN A

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:25.153
CALIFORNIA CASE THAT THERE IS A

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.589
LOCAL REPORTING FIRM THAT HAS

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.357
RESPONSIBILITY SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:31.927
IF. YOU DO SOMETHING THAT IS

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:35.830
CONTRARY TO- EITHER. OUR LAWS

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:38.200
ARE STANDARDS THAT THAT THERE

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:41.670
IS A LOCAL- THROAT TO CHOKE AS

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:44.105
IT WERE- AND SO THAT THE COURT

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.708
HAS THE ABILITY TO FOR EXAMPLE-

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.843
MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT. THE

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.278
RECORD IS ACCURATE NUMBER ONE

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.580
WITH RESPECT TO DEPOSITIONS

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.781
INTO THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.583
UNTOWARD THAT HAPPENS THERE'S

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.751
AN ABILITY TO YOU KNOW RAIN IN

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.420
AT LEAST IF THERE IS A GAP WE

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.888
WILL LOOK TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:00.622
CLOSE THAT GAP BUT THAT'S THE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.958
INTENT. AND YOUR INTENT WITH

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:05.026
THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:05.927
THEY WOULD BE HELD ALL THE

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:12.200
SAME. STATUTORY RULES AS WOOD-

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.068
YOU KNOW THE SMALL. BUSINESS

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.236
HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT'S OWNED

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:18.006
BY A SHORTHAND REPORTER WELL.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.274
THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BROAD I'M

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.709
NOT SURE THAT AN OUT OF STATE

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.310
COURT REPORTING FIRM WOULD HAVE

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:23.812
TO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DEAL

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:25.313
WITH WORKERS COMPENSATION SOME

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.748
OTHER CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.250
THAT ARE APPLIED TO SMALL

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.585
BUSINESSES NOW- IN TERMS OF THE

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.487
ACCURACY OF THE RECORD YES.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.456
YEAH BUT IN TERMS OF THE

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:38.426
SPECIFICS OF- I HAVE CONDUCTED.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.695
YOUR DPOSITIONS ENSURE INTERNS

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:41.963
OF GUILT SWEARING THE WITNESS

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.499
IN THE OATH THAT IS

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.100
ADMINISTERED IN THOSE KINDS OF

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:51.640
THINGS YES. AND THEN I THINK

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:52.707
YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:54.042
BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT ABOUT THE

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.045
REMOTE TESTIMONY- I THINK FOR A

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.080
LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME- THAT

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.348
MAKES SENSE WELL IN IT AND I

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:02.150
AND I WRITE THAT UNDER THE-

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:04.319
UNDER YOUR BILL IT'S ONLY IF

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.186
ALL PARTIES HAVE AGREED. TO DO

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:08.757
REMOTE THAT IS RIGHT THAT'S THE

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.026
MOST COMMON CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:14.663
PARTIES STIPULATE- A. B. OF THE

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.131
REPRESENTATIVE CAN MAKE A

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:18.733
MOTION IN THE COURT CAN- PERMIT

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.335
REMOTE TESTIMONY THERE'S A

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:21.202
SERIES OF FACTORS THAT THE

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.837
COURT MUST CONSIDER. SO THERE'S

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.973
A STIPULATION OR IF THE COURT

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.609
ORDERS IT. YEAH THAT'S CORRECT

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.077
UPON MOTION WILL PARTY RIGHT

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:31.313
AND I MAY BE A MOTION THE COURT

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:35.817
BUT I'M SURE IT'S MOTION PARTY.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.152
I AM FOR THAT LIMITED PERIOD OF

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.953
TIME I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.689
SUPPORTABLE AND WHERE YOU HAVE

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.157
WHERE IT IS EITHER COURT ORDER

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:45.126
BY STIPULATION- BUT I DO FEEL

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.662
THAT IN PERSON TESTIMONY IS THE

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.464
BEST YOU KNOW BOTH. FOR THE

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:53.301
RECORD BUT YOU KNOW- MORE GOING

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:55.270
TO COURT TO RESOLVE ISSUES. YOU

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.538
KNOW PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN PERSON

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.807
AND IN YOUR FOR PROVIDING

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:14.482
MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:15.549
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A BILL

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.385
OF RIGHTS THAT THEY AND THEIR

THE OF THOSE ARE OVERSEEN BY

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.769
DCHS RIGHT NOW. THERE THERE

ACCOUNTABILITY. RIGHT BUT I

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.285
THINK THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:55.056
THAT ALSO KIND OF LEADS TO-

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:56.957
WHAT COULD BE A PROLIFERATION

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:59.293
OF LAWSUITS SAYING HEY YOU

PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS IN

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.906
HERE THAT I THINK COULD

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.375
ENCOURAGE THAT AND CERTAINLY-

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:15.443
WE WANT TO DEAL WITH BAD

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:18.279
ACTORS. AND UNETHICAL PRACTICES

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:19.747
BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:22.216
UNDERMINE. ACCESS AND

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.018
AVAILABILITY OF DRUG TREATMENT

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.619
BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:28.355
ACROSS THE BOARD AND IF. AND IF

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:31.058

SOME OF THESE DRUG TREATMENT

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:47.241
PROBLEMATIC AND YOU HAVE. ANY

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:48.442
THOUGHTS THAT MAYBE MANY

TERRY GENERAL ACTION- THERE'S

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:05.192
NOTHING THAT. BASICALLY SKILLS

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:07.628
IS BACK SO UNDER CURRENT LAW IF

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:10.131
YOU'RE A PROVIDER AND YOU DON'T

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.266
FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE TREATMENT-

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:15.536
AND- THAT THAT CAUSES HARM THE

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:16.837
SAME STANDARD WOULD APPLY IT

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:17.938

CURRENT RIGHTS ARE JUST SIMPLY-

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:24.545
IT JUST SIMPLY PROVIDES A BILL

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.547
OF RIGHTS TO PATIENTS SO THAT

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:27.581

JURISDICTIONS AND IT IS NOT

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:16.882
JUST ABOUT TOT IT IS ABOUT

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.718
NEIGHBORHOODS AND IS ABOUT

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.488
MANAGING SHORT TERM RENTALS. IN

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:23.355
THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:24.824
LIVE AND SO YES THE

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:25.991
JURISDICTIONS NEED THAT

02:04:26.058 --> 02:04:27.326
INFORMATION AND YOU'VE BUILT IN

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:29.295

THE- WE CAN HAVE SOME

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:34.967
CONFIDENCE THAT. THE CORRECT

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:36.302
AMOUNT OF TOT IS BEING

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:38.404
COLLECTED BUT WITHOUT BEING

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.606
ABLE TO KNOW THE EXACT

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:41.841
LOCATIONS THAT MAKES IT MUCH

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:44.076
HARDER FOR LOCAL JURISDCTIONS

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:45.644
TO ENACT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:47.446
THAT THEY HAVE UP AND DOWN. IN

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:49.682
THE AREAS WHERE IN MY INSTANCE

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.450
FOR EXAMPLE DOWN THE COAST BUT

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:52.952
IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S

02:04:53.018 --> 02:04:54.353
HIGH TOURIST TRAFFIC IN AND OUT

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.689
AND AHIGH DESIRE TO. TAKE

02:04:56.755 --> 02:04:58.123
HOMES AND TURNED THEM INTO

02:04:58.190 --> 02:05:00.025
SHORT TERM RENTALS WHICH DOES

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:00.993
MULTIPLE THINGS INCLUDING

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.262
TAKING HOUSING OFF OF THE

02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:05.831
MARKET IN IN AREAS WHERE IT'S

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:07.032
DESPERATELY NEEDED. I THINK

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.234
THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF MOVING

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:09.935
FORWARD JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:11.070
SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:12.638
NOT DON'T HAVE THE CLOUT OF

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.740
SOME OF THE OTHERS TO BE ABLE

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:15.307
TO NEGOTIATE THESE VOLUNTARY

02:05:15.374 --> 02:05:16.976
COLLECTION AGREEMENTS. THIS

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.711
WILL ENSURE AT LEAST THE TOT IS

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:19.812
MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I

02:05:19.879 --> 02:05:22.047
THINK WE CANNOT. OVERLOOK THE

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:23.549
FACT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:25.784
IS SOUGHT BY THE CITIES AND THE

02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:27.820
COUNTIES ABOUT WHERE THIS.

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:30.222
DECATUR RENTALS ARE LOCATED. IS

02:05:30.289 --> 02:05:31.624
VERY KEY NOT JUST IN THE

02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:33.325
COLLECTION OF TOT BUT IN THE

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:36.195
MANAGEMENT OF. THE ISSUES THAT

02:05:36.262 --> 02:05:37.329
THEY HAVE HAD WITH WITH SHORT

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:39.164
TERM RENTALS TO FREE TO STEP

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:41.200
FORWARD BUT IT IS A BIT LACKING

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:42.835
I ACTUALLY KNOW YOU AGREE WITH

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:43.836
ME ON THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:45.671
CONVERSATION. SO I APPRECIATE

02:05:45.738 --> 02:05:47.306
THAT BUT I WANTED TO FRAME THAT

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:53.679
FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT WITH

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.481
SOME CONCERNS THAT I THINK WE

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.483
NEED TO BE COGNIZANT- RIGHT

02:05:57.549 --> 02:06:01.654

PERSPECTIVE THAT- THIS IS A

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:54.059
COMPLICATED AREA AND THERE'S

DISCUSSING THIS VERY ISSUE- SO

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:03.969
I WANTED TO STATE A FEW THINGS

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:05.337
ABOUT WHAT I THINK THIS BILL IS

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.071
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:06.905
UNDERSTAND IS CORRECT AND I

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:09.041
NEED A QUESTION WHICH IS. MY

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:10.209
UNDERSTANDING IS YOUR BILL

02:09:10.275 --> 02:09:12.611
ESTABLISHES AN OPTIONAL AND

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:14.813
VOLUNTARY STRUCTURE ONLY FOR

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.048
THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT CHOOSE

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.616
TO DO SO THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:18.484
BE ABLE TO COLLECT MILLIONS OF

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:21.086
DOLLARS IT'S NOT MANDATORY SO

02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:22.554
ANY JURISDICTION THAT WISHES TO

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:24.056
ENACT THEIR OWN ORDINANCE OR DO

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.691
SOMETHING ELSE CAN DO SO. THAT

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:27.259
ANY CITY CAN ADJUSTED TAX RATE

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:28.660
OR EXIT THE PROGRAM AT THE

02:09:28.727 --> 02:09:31.096
TIME- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:33.232
WHERE THE BILL IS THAT CORRECT

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:35.134
SEPTEMBER YOU'RE A 100% CORRECT

02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:40.639
OPTIONAL NUMBER TWO CITIES HAVE

02:09:40.706 --> 02:09:42.474
TO OPT IN NUMBER THREE THERE'S

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:44.243

KNOW IF SOMEBODY IS OPTING FOR

02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:26.932
THIS- THAT THEY CAN THEN GO AN

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:29.735
AUDIT AND ENSURE. THAT THEY'RE

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:40.812
GETTING THE T. O. T. AT THE

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:41.313
ROAD BECAUSE I JUST WANT

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:41.880

PAYING THE SAME TAX- TO THE

02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:53.291
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO THE I MEAN

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:56.194
IS THERE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:56.795
THE BIG CONCERN IS HOW DO WE

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.663
ENSURE THAT STE THAT THAT CAN

02:13:58.730 --> 02:14:00.432

YOU'RE AND I TALKED ABOUT OVER

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:26.024
THE WEEKEND. I THINK THE- THE

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:28.493
BOTTOM LINE OF THIS BILL IS

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.796
THIS. WE'VE ATTEMPTED IT. I

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:32.798

COMING YEARS ON THIS VERY

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:40.205
SPECIFIC ISSUE- I DO NOT THINK

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:43.508
AT THIS TIME. WE WOULD BE ABLE

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:46.111
TO GET A BILL WITH THAT WITH

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:49.247
THOSE PROVISIONS THROUGH. BASED

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:52.584
SOLELY OFF OF POLITICS- AND

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:55.987
WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE IS ON A

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:56.922
STEP BY STEP BASIS TO MAKE

02:14:56.988 --> 02:14:59.691
PROGRESS. SO RIGHT NOW THERE

02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:00.225
ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:02.160
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ESPECIALLY

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:03.462
IN RURAL COUNTIES AND

02:15:03.528 --> 02:15:05.397
COMMUNITIES. I THEY'RE BEING

02:15:05.464 --> 02:15:08.233
LEFT ON THE TABLE. THIS MAKES

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:09.801
PROGRESS IN THAT IN THE OTHER

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:12.604
ISSUE IS IT CREATES PARITY SO

02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:13.972
RIGHT NOW YOU LITERALLY HAVE

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:16.441
THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT ARE NOT

02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:19.177
PAYING THE TAX THAT

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:20.178
JURISDICTION'S ARE RIGHTFULLY

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:22.948
DO. WHICH MEANS THIS BILL WILL

02:15:23.014 --> 02:15:26.718
PUT THOSE VACATION RENTALS ON

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:31.056
THE SAME- RUNWAY AS SMALL

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.791
HOTELS AS WELL IN OUR

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:35.360
JURISDICTIONS SO ON THEY HAVE

02:15:35.427 --> 02:15:37.295
TO PAY THE SAME TAX RATE AS

02:15:37.362 --> 02:15:39.898
THOSE HOTELS AND- MISTER VICE

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.470
A BILL THAT WOULD DO WHAT

THINKING VICE CHAIR WE WORKED

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:55.180
ON. SEVERAL ISSUES IN REGARDS

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.781
TO RESOURCES A WILDFIRE AND BE

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:59.484
HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS.

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:00.886
AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:03.088
SENATOR IN THEM ONE OTHER ISSUE

02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:06.892
THAT CAME UP- IS AND GUESTS

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:07.592
COME FROM LIKE GROUPS LIKE

02:16:07.659 --> 02:16:08.994
BOOKING DOT COM WHERE THEY'RE

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:12.397
NOT ACTUALLY THE- YOU KNOW

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:14.966
THEY'RE NOT TAKING THE PAYMENT.

02:16:15.033 --> 02:16:15.600
THEY DON'T ACCEPT PAYMENT FROM

02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:19.070
THE PURCHASER- YOU KNOW COULD

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:20.739
THEY BE CONSIDERED YOU KNOW

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:21.973
TAKEN OU OF THE DEFINITION OF

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.876
A SHORT TERM RENTAL FACILITATOR

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:27.178
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN-TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I COULD

02:16:27.245 --> 02:16:29.014
SEE THAT ARGUMENT WHERE THEY'RE

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:29.581
NOT ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT'S

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:32.884
RENTING THE- THE OFFICIALLY OUT

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:34.586
TAKING PET- PAYMENT FROM

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:36.755
CONSUMERS SO SHOULD THEY BE

02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:37.656
REALLY THE ONES REPORTING THIS

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:39.524
DATA. YOU REALLY SHOULD BE THE

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:41.026
PERSON THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:43.094
RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THAT. YES

02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:46.998
SO. THE WAY BOOKING WORKS IS

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:48.300
THEY HAVE A THIRD PARTY VENDOR

02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:52.237
THAT ACTUALLY COLLECTS SO-

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:54.039
THERE IS A VENDOR THAT TAKES

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:57.676
THE PAYMENT- AND BOOKING IS

02:16:57.742 --> 02:16:58.944
CORRECT THAT THEY DON'T SEE

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:00.245
THAT TRANSACTION THROUGH THEIR

02:17:00.312 --> 02:17:01.947
SYSTEM HERE IN THE UNITED

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:03.782
STATES AT THIS TIME. NOW THERE

02:17:03.848 --> 02:17:06.918
IS LITIGATION PENDING IN ITALY.

SOME TIME ON IT I AM A LITTLE

02:59:42.838 --> 02:59:44.607
BIT CONCERNED AND I'VE SPOKEN

02:59:46.775 --> 02:59:48.811
ON THIS THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.913
GENERAL ACT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:51.447
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

02:59:51.514 --> 02:59:54.250
PROVIDES A REAL. ROAD FOR

02:59:54.316 --> 02:59:55.784
REMEDIES FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

02:59:55.851 --> 02:59:57.520
MISTREATED AND I THINK WE

02:59:57.586 --> 02:59:59.522

02:59:59.588 --> 03:00:01.690
SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FOR

REMOVAL OF AN EMPLOYEE'S

03:00:02.658 --> 03:00:04.827
ABILITY. TO SEEK THOSE REMEDIES

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:06.795
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NEGATIVE

03:00:06.862 --> 03:00:08.597
MYTHOLOGY THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP

03:00:08.664 --> 03:00:10.966
AROUND PAGA EVEN THOUGH IT'S-

03:00:11.033 --> 03:00:12.935
NOT EVEN TWENTY YEARS OLD NOW.

03:00:13.002 --> 03:00:15.137
BUT THE LIMITATIONS BUILT INTO

03:00:15.204 --> 03:00:17.573
THAT LAW ARE STILL APPROPRIATE

CONTINUE TO BE AT THE TABLE

03:22:37.411 --> 03:22:39.347
BECAUSE- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

03:27:24.832 --> 03:27:26.634
THAT A GOP H. LAWYER COULD LEAD

03:29:07.167 --> 03:29:08.736
IT SAYS IS INDEED OUR

03:29:08.802 --> 03:29:10.571
DIFFERENCE TO THE LEGISLATURE

THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

03:29:16.343 --> 03:29:18.012

03:29:43.137 --> 03:29:45.906
DECADES AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF

IDEAS BUT WE DIDN'T GET THIS

03:29:53.814 --> 03:29:55.349
OPPOSITION LETTER UNTIL WE

WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF THIS

03:33:50.184 --> 03:33:52.119
PROBLEM GREATER THAN OUR

03:33:52.186 --> 03:33:54.121
LARGEST PORTS. THERE

03:33:54.188 --> 03:33:55.789
EXPLICATION OF THE DOMINANT

03:33:55.856 --> 03:33:57.357
ECONOMIC MODEL TRUCKING

03:33:57.424 --> 03:33:59.393
COMPANIES HIRE A WORKFORCE OF

03:33:59.459 --> 03:34:01.161

ARE FORCED TO ACT AS IF THEY

03:34:02.829 --> 03:34:04.431

ACCEPTING EXTREMELY LOW

03:34:13.473 --> 03:34:15.142
NONNEGOTIABLE RIGHT. IT'S NOT

03:34:15.209 --> 03:34:16.443
UNCOMMON TO HAVE MONTHS WHERE

03:34:16.510 --> 03:34:18.011
THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE

03:34:18.078 --> 03:34:19.112
TRUCK IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE

03:34:19.179 --> 03:34:21.215

PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE

RELYING. LARGELY BLIND. EARLIER

AT HOW OUR STATE DEALT WITH

03:50:33.619 --> 03:50:36.189
THIS UNPRECEDENTED THREAT. WE

03:50:36.255 --> 03:50:38.157
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT

03:50:38.224 --> 03:50:39.792
THIS BILL DOES ONLY TWO SIMPLE

03:50:39.859 --> 03:50:42.261
THINGS FIRST IT WOULD AD

DETAIL TO THREE OF THE MANY

THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE ABOUT

03:50:47.366 --> 03:50:47.900
WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN

03:50:47.967 --> 03:50:50.670
INFECTED. IF WE KNOW MORE ABOUT

HOW I DISEASE MIGHT BE

03:50:51.871 --> 03:50:54.473
SPREADING WE CAN TAKE SMARTER

03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:55.641
STEPS TO STOP ITS SPREAD.

03:50:55.708 --> 03:50:57.343
SECOND THE BILL MAKES CHANGES

03:50:57.410 --> 03:50:58.678

03:51:08.454 --> 03:51:10.256
INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. ARE BILL

03:51:10.323 --> 03:51:12.091
WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO

03:51:12.158 --> 03:51:12.792

03:51:20.499 --> 03:51:22.468
EXPEDITED PROCESS OF AYE BY ALL

PROTECTIONS IN LAW. AND WE EVEN

PANDEMIC BUT IT'S NEVER TOO

03:51:41.053 --> 03:51:43.456
EARLY TO PREPARE. FOR THE NEXT

03:51:43.522 --> 03:51:44.257

THAT I THAT WE- SAW DURING THIS

03:57:52.191 --> 03:57:54.927
PANDEMIC WHICH IS. THAT YOU

03:57:56.562 --> 03:57:58.564
SEEM TO BE MADE AT THE COUNTY

LINES OF THIS- BUT- IT SEEM

03:58:14.046 --> 03:58:15.781
LIKE WE DID NOT GET A LOT OF

03:58:15.848 --> 03:58:17.850

03:58:17.916 --> 03:58:18.350

ACADEMIC COMMUNITY WHICH I

03:58:21.620 --> 03:58:23.322
THINK IS VERY CRITICAL WE HAVE

03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:24.390
SOME GREAT PUBLIC HEALTH

03:58:24.456 --> 03:58:26.892
PROGRAMS IN ACADEMIA HERE IN

03:58:26.959 --> 03:58:29.895
THE STATE- AND I THINK THIS

03:58:29.962 --> 03:58:31.597
GETS SAID HEY WE NEED TO ENSURE

03:58:31.664 --> 03:58:33.432
THAT THIS DATA IS BEING SHARED.

03:58:33.499 --> 03:58:35.601
AND EVEN TIMES WHEN. WE WOULD

03:58:35.668 --> 03:58:37.269
INQUIRE OF WHERE ARE YOU

03:58:37.336 --> 03:58:38.537
GETTING THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS

03:58:38.604 --> 03:58:39.938
THE DECISION THAT IS COMING OUT

03:58:40.005 --> 03:58:41.407
OF THIS AND WE'D BE TOLD WELL

03:58:41.473 --> 03:58:43.275
WE CAN'T SHARE THAT. DATA WITH

03:58:43.342 --> 03:58:45.577
YOU TO BE TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS

03:58:45.644 --> 03:58:47.579
IN ELECTED OFFICE AND WHO.

03:58:47.646 --> 03:58:48.814
CONSTITUENTS LOOK TO FOR

03:58:48.881 --> 03:58:50.983
ANSWERS AS TO WHY THINGS ARE

03:58:51.050 --> 03:58:52.718
HAPPENING WHY DECISIONS ARE

03:58:52.785 --> 03:58:54.453

CAN'T SHARE THAT DATA- IS

03:59:00.092 --> 03:59:01.326
EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC SO I

03:59:01.393 --> 03:59:03.195
THINK THIS BILL IS A GOOD FIRST

03:59:03.262 --> 03:59:06.598
STEP OF ENSURING THAT WE- FIRST

03:59:06.665 --> 03:59:07.966
OF ALL SHARE THIS INFORMATION

03:59:08.033 --> 03:59:10.469
WITH OUR RESEARCHERS AND- AND

03:59:10.536 --> 03:59:11.804
SOME REALLY. BRIGHT PEOPLE IN

VACUUM. AND WITH SORT OF A

03:59:30.055 --> 03:59:31.824
GROUP THINK MENTALITY. I DON'T
