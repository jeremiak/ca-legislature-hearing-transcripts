FRAZIER STAFF.

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:36.828 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PATH FORWARD

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:37.696 region:rollup2
AS PRESENTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.997 region:rollup2
THE MORE APPROPRIATE PATH FOR

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:40.799 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:42.467 region:rollup2
A SIMPLY THE WAY THE BILL AS

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:43.568 region:rollup2
DRAFTED IS IS MUCH TOO BROAD

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:46.071 region:rollup2
THEIR FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:47.572 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS IN CALIFORNIA ALL

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:49.107 region:rollup2
OF THEM WITH A DIFFERENT SIZE

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:51.843 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT SCOPE. PARKING IS

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:53.578 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A SERIOUS ISSUE.

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:55.013 region:rollup2
I FEW HAVE A CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:56.681 region:rollup2
A WITH UNDERGROUND PARKING

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:59.484 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NOT FLEXIBILITY

00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:00.986 region:rollup2
THERE YOU HAVE OTHER SITUATIONS

00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:02.821 region:rollup2
A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE.

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.955 region:rollup2
QUAD PLEXUS.

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:05.657 region:rollup2
LEX'S EXCEPT FOR WITH LIMITED

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:07.359 region:rollup2
STREET PARKING.

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:09.127 region:rollup2
A COLORADO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:10.462 region:rollup2
THIS AND IN FACT THE AMENDMENTS

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:11.630 region:rollup2
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL

00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:14.433 region:rollup2
REALLY FOLLOW THE PATH OF

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:16.368 region:rollup2
COLORADO. IN ALLOWING FOR.

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:18.236 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SIZE SPECIFICATIONS

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:19.938 region:rollup2
ALLOWING FOR CERTAIN REASONABLE

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:21.807 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS TO BE MADE UP BY

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:23.341 region:rollup2
THE ASSOCIATION TO FIT THE

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:26.278 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY SEE

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:26.945 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AND. AS WRITTEN RIGHT

00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:28.713 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.248 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD JUST SIMPLY

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:32.584 region:rollup2
EXCLUDE ALL RULES.

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:35.487 region:rollup2
AND ALL RESTRICTIONS ON PARKING.

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:36.855 region:rollup2
YOU COULD THEN SEE OTHER OWNERS

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:38.824 region:rollup2
IN THE PARKING LOT IN THAT.

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:40.458 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:32:38.824 --> 00:32:41.726 region:rollup2
A PARKING SPOT LOSE THAT PARKING

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.861 region:rollup2
SPOTS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.729 region:rollup2
HIS BILL DRAFTED THERE'S NO

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:46.364 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT. TO ACTUALLY SHOW

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:48.700 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE USE OF THE

EMERGENCY VEHICLE IS REQUIRED AT

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.304 region:rollup2
THAT ANYTIME I AT THAT TIME AND

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:53.038 region:rollup2
PLACE SO.

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.873 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:57.209 region:rollup2
OPPOSE THE CURRENT VERSION OF

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:58.844 region:rollup2
THE BILL HOW WE APPRECIATE THE

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:01.947 region:rollup2
WORK OF THE STAFF AND WOOD.

00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:03.448 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION

00:33:01.947 --> 00:33:05.116 region:rollup2
OUT ONCE WE WERE SEE THESE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.618 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS IN PRINT IF THEY WERE

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.919 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT THAT FAR. THANK YOU

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:11.756 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:14.125 region:rollup2
NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:15.393 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO.

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.528 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE IN THIS FRAZIER

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:18.964 region:rollup2
AYE BUT I APPLAUD YOUR

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:20.232 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT WORK AND AND

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:22.200 region:rollup2
STEPPING UP YOUR CONSIDER THINK

00:33:20.232 --> 00:33:24.002 region:rollup2
THAT'S. ABSOLUTE NOBLE.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.136 region:rollup2
ON THIS ONE THOUGH I HAD NOT AT

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.704 region:rollup2
A POINT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:28.106 region:rollup2
AND.

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:29.674 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:31.142 region:rollup2
WE WENT SORT OF A A A BALANCE

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.644 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE HOMEOWNER

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:34.779 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS INDIVIDUALS AND

00:33:32.644 --> 00:33:35.514 region:rollup2
ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE AND. AND

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.449 region:rollup2
I'M SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:39.084 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SITUATION BEFORE WHAT

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:40.685 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN.

00:33:39.084 --> 00:33:41.953 region:rollup2
I I DON'T KNOW HOW BROAD THIS IS

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.355 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:45.757 region:rollup2
REALLY IN A POSITION TO WANT TO

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:47.092 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE. TO TO

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:47.959 region:rollup2
SOLVE YOUR PARTICULAR PROBLEM

00:33:47.092 --> 00:33:49.728 region:rollup2
AND WE.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:51.263 region:rollup2
LOOK THAT.

00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:53.098 region:rollup2
COLORADO WE LOOKED AT OTHER

00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:55.033 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES AND AND PROPOSED

00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:55.600 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS AROUND THAT SO WE

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:57.102 region:rollup2
WERE GONNA MOVE THIS BILL

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.603 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AMENDMENTS I THINK

00:33:57.102 --> 00:34:05.010 region:rollup2
WOULD BE KEY OTHER THAN THAT

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:05.644 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST NOT AMERICAN.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.746 region:rollup2
THEY CAN I DO TO FLETCHER CAN I

00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:08.680 region:rollup2
JUST ASK WHAT.

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:10.548 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.150 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I I WANT TO

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:13.919 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS WITH THE AMENDMENTS

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.354 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN'T OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT.

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:19.190 region:rollup2
SO THE FACILITY WHERE THE H.

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:20.392 region:rollup2
AWAY SUGGESTING IN PARK IS OVER

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.593 region:rollup2
A QUARTER MILE AWAY BEHIND A

00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:24.362 region:rollup2
LOCKED GATE.

00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:25.330 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK I

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.665 region:rollup2
MIGHT AS WELL BE OUTSIDE THE

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.267 region:rollup2
PREMISES.

00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:31.570 region:rollup2
EN ROUTE ON THE PUBLIC STREET

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:33.238 region:rollup2
OF BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEXT EXIT.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.805 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.607 region:rollup2
WORKING CAN I LIVE IN AN H.

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:37.542 region:rollup2
AWAY.

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:39.177 region:rollup2
ALSO AND I HAVE A MARTINEZ

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:40.579 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER CANINE WHO PARKS

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:42.047 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO PARK

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.647 region:rollup2
ON THE STREET THEY TAKE IT ALL

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:44.449 region:rollup2
OF US ALSO IF WE HAPPEN TO DO

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:47.319 region:rollup2
SO.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:48.853 region:rollup2
AND SO I IN THE EVENINGS AND SO

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:50.588 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:52.457 region:rollup2
THINGS WHERE WE DID TRY TO.

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:54.359 region:rollup2
CONTACT FIRST THE H. AWAY AND

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:55.794 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NEVER EVEN GAVE US THE

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:58.163 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF A RETURN PHONE

00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:59.531 region:rollup2
CALL OR. AT ED OUR LETTER.

00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:01.600 region:rollup2
AND SO WE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:03.101 region:rollup2
ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.703 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE. YOU KNOW

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.271 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING NOT ONLY PUBLIC

00:35:04.703 --> 00:35:08.440 region:rollup2
SAFETY BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:10.342 region:rollup2
CONCERN. MEAN THE SAFETY OFFICER

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.977 region:rollup2
FOR THE CITY OF VACAVILLE AND

00:35:10.342 --> 00:35:13.945 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:15.814 region:rollup2
KIND OF TRAGEDY.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:17.682 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:20.285 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT WOULD THIS

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:22.654 region:rollup2
LEFTIST NO KIND OF RECOURSE

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:24.789 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS.

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:25.690 region:rollup2
ARE ARE KIND OF JUST HE MIGHT AS

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:27.092 region:rollup2
WELL PARK OUT ON THE STREET

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.460 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE H. AWAY BECAUSE

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:29.694 region:rollup2
THAT'S I MEAN IT'S VERY CLOSE

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.096 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. COOLER

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:32.631 region:rollup2
THINGS JUST.

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:36.401 region:rollup2
KIND OF A.

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2

THE AMENDMENTS. TOO SICK TO WORK

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:24.536 region:rollup2
AT THE NEXT LEVEL TO SEE HOW YOU

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.471 region:rollup2
CAN WORD IT IN SUCH A WAY. THAT

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:28.406 region:rollup2
DOES PROVIDE THE PROTECTION FOR

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:30.275 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE HOMEOWNERS BY

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:32.010 region:rollup2
HAVING SOMEBODY WITH THAT SUCH

00:38:30.275 --> 00:38:34.145 region:rollup2
AS MR SURVEY THOUGH THERE BUT

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.381 region:rollup2
STILL THAT BROUGHT PROVIDES SOME

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:38.116 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED BY THE H. HIGHWAYS.

00:38:36.381 --> 00:38:39.284 region:rollup2
AS TO HOW MANY OF THESE PERMITS

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:40.985 region:rollup2
ARE GIVEN.

00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:42.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IT DOES WITH FIFTY

OUR PART.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:55.400 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT

00:38:53.765 --> 00:38:58.870 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD BE

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
EMBRACED INSTEAD OF VILIFIED.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.439 region:rollup2

00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:54.385 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY LOWER COST OF

00:45:54.385 --> 00:45:58.723 region:rollup2
THAT THEREOF. DEVELOPERS WILL

AFFORDABLE CONDOMINIUMS AND

00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:04.929 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO.

DESIRED RESULT OF AB TWENTY

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:13.471 region:rollup2
THREE FIFTY THREE.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:15.539 region:rollup2
BUT JUST A MINUTE ABOUT

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS OF

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:19.543 region:rollup2
OF. ABOUT.

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:21.145 region:rollup2
TWELVE YEARS AGO WE WANTED TO

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:22.813 region:rollup2
APPROVE THE FACT THAT THE LOW

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:25.283 region:rollup2
INCOME FOLKS COULD.

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:27.685 region:rollup2
BUY A HOME SO WE WE.

00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:29.287 region:rollup2
SAID ABOUT TO BUILD OF HOMES AND

00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:30.955 region:rollup2
FIREBALL CALIFORNIA.

00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:32.456 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE GREAT

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.991 region:rollup2
RECESSION STARTED ABOUT THEN BUT

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:35.726 region:rollup2
MANAGED TO GET A CONSTRUCTION

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:37.828 region:rollup2
LOAN AND BUILT TEN HOMES AND

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:39.964 region:rollup2
SOLD THEM AND NOBODY HAS GONE

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:42.199 region:rollup2
BANKRUPT SINCE THEN. SO WE WE WE

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:43.934 region:rollup2
PROVED OUR POINT BUT WE ALSO.

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:45.269 region:rollup2
LEARN THAT THERE'S PREVAILING

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:47.238 region:rollup2
WAGE AND.

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.539 region:rollup2
CONDO INSURANCE IN A LOT OF

00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:49.907 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS THAT GO INTO

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.542 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND WE QUICKLY

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:53.644 region:rollup2
CHANGED FROM BEING A DEVELOPER

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:54.445 region:rollup2
TO BE AN ADVOCATE. AND I THINK

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.247 region:rollup2
IT WAS A GOOD DECISION.

00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:58.182 region:rollup2
OF.

00:46:56.247 --> 00:47:00.718 region:rollup2
WE WE WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:02.353 region:rollup2
SO WE START FOCUSING ON ON

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:03.854 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:02.353 --> 00:47:05.856 region:rollup2
WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS TALKING

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:07.725 region:rollup2
ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.693 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S COMPLIMENTARY BUT WE

00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:10.027 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S

00:47:08.693 --> 00:47:11.629 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:13.097 region:rollup2
APPLY BEING BUILT IT IN IN THE

00:47:11.629 --> 00:47:14.131 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:47:13.097 --> 00:47:17.101 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:18.936 region:rollup2
AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE

00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:21.539 region:rollup2
A LOT OF HOMES ARE BEING.

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:23.274 region:rollup2
BUILT THAT ARE LIKE FOUR EIGHT

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:24.775 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A LOT MORE

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.444 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S IS MISSING MIDDLE

CONTINUATION OF ILLEGAL

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.653 region:rollup2

RENTAL MARKET.

00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:24.861 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS NOT INTENDED AS A

00:59:22.259 --> 00:59:26.229 region:rollup2
TOOL TO AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.831 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAW.

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.866 region:rollup2
THE ELLIS ACT.

00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:32.169 region:rollup2

BUILDING FROM THE RENTAL MARKET.

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.774 region:rollup2
THE LOG INDICATES THAT THERE'S

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:39.643 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:41.445 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF CALCULATING RENTAL

00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:43.713 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS WHEN UNITS ARE RE

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:47.350 region:rollup2
AS CAN BE A AS CAN OCCUR UNDER

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:48.952 region:rollup2
THE HOUR FACT BUT THERE IS ALSO

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:50.821 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE GOVERNING THE TENANTS

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:52.789 region:rollup2
LEASE TERMINATION DATE. THAT

00:59:50.821 --> 00:59:54.558 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ALLOW MULTIPLE

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:55.792 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATES IN ADDITION

00:59:54.558 --> 00:59:57.894 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PROVISION THAT

00:59:55.792 --> 01:00:00.097 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:00.630 region:rollup2
DAY THAT APPLIES IF THE PROPERTY

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.398 region:rollup2
IS PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.699 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:04.501 region:rollup2
AS A CONSEQUENCE

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:05.569 region:rollup2
SOME LANDLORDS

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:07.270 region:rollup2
OF TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:09.306 region:rollup2
CONFUSION AND REMOVED UNITS FROM

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:12.275 region:rollup2
THE RENTAL MARKET. AND RETURN

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:13.877 region:rollup2
THEM IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION TO

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
AVOID THE ACT'S RESTRICTIONS AND

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:17.681 region:rollup2
EVADE RENT CONTROL.

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.715 region:rollup2
SOME ARE ALSO APPLYING DIFFERENT

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DIFFERENT

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.917 region:rollup2
UNITS AND CLAIMING THAT

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.885 region:rollup2
RETURNING ONE UNIT TO THE

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:23.854 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:25.822 region:rollup2
DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:27.691 region:rollup2
TO RE OFFER ANY OTHER UNITS TO

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:29.559 region:rollup2
FORMER TENANTS.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:31.995 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:33.130 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW LASTED ALL

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.632 region:rollup2
OF THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.166 region:rollup2
MARKET AND IN FACT NEVER.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.635 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LEAVE THE RENTAL

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:39.169 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.370 region:rollup2
IS THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:41.938 region:rollup2
ELLIS.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.907 region:rollup2
OF ALL WHILE STILL HAVING

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:45.242 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY EVICTED ALL OF THE

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:47.177 region:rollup2
EXISTING TENANTS AND INCREASING

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:48.678 region:rollup2
THE RENTS.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:50.914 region:rollup2
SO THIS CONFUSION AS LEAD AT

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:52.782 region:rollup2
LEAST ONE COURT OF APPEAL TO

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:54.351 region:rollup2
FIND THAT A LANDLORD COULD APPLY

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:56.153 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WITHDRAWAL DATES TO

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:57.687 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE RENTAL AMOUNT WHEN

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.055 region:rollup2
RE RENTING A UNIT.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:00.557 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWED THE LANDLORD TO

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.992 region:rollup2
CHOOSE A DATE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.893 region:rollup2
OF TIME WHEN THE ACT WOULD

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.427 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THOSE UNITS TO BE

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:06.062 region:rollup2
OFFERED.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:08.465 region:rollup2
PRIOR RENT CONTROLLED RAE

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:10.834 region:rollup2
DESPITE HAVING RETURNED MULTIPLE

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:12.369 region:rollup2
OTHER UNITS ON THE PROPERTY THE

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:14.037 region:rollup2
RENTAL TO THE RENTAL MARKET AT

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:16.206 region:rollup2
AN EARLIER TIME.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:17.040 region:rollup2
THE LANDLORD NEVER ACTUALLY LEFT

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:19.576 region:rollup2
THE RENTAL MARKET BUT

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.912 region:rollup2
NEVERTHELESS WAS ABLE TO EVICT

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:25.015 region:rollup2
ALL THE TENETS AND RE RENT ALL

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:27.684 region:rollup2
OF THE UNITS AT MARKET RATES.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:29.853 region:rollup2
THIS I THINK A OF WE SHOULD ALL

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.388 region:rollup2
AGREE IS A GROSS DISTORTION AND

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.023 region:rollup2
SUBVERSION OF THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.924 region:rollup2
ALICE ACT.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.659 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:37.060 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OR NOT.

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:38.261 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE RENT CONTROL

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.664 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THE COURTS ARE

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:42.866 region:rollup2
MISINTERPRETING THE LAW AS A

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:44.701 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THE CREATIVE ACTIONS

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:47.504 region:rollup2
OF A FEW LANDLORDS.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:48.038 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IMPERATIVE TO CLARIFY

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:49.673 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LAW HAS MEANT ALL

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:51.107 region:rollup2
ALONG.

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:52.576 region:rollup2

HOLLYWOOD.

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.494 region:rollup2
ALICE ACT WAS TO ALLOW LANDLORDS

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:13.029 region:rollup2
TO EVICT ALL THE TENANTS FROM

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:14.598 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY ALL AT ONCE.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.865 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO COMPLETELY LEAVE THE

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:18.702 region:rollup2
RENTAL MARKET AND PUT THAT

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:19.769 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TO A DIFFERENT YEARS.

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:21.404 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:23.106 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IN THE ALICE ACT TO

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:25.075 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY A VIABLE

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:26.977 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE USE BEFORE SERVING

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:29.646 region:rollup2
EVICTION NOTICES. AND BECAUSE

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:31.281 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS ALLOWS LANDLORDS

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:32.782 region:rollup2
TO SET THE RENTS AT MARKET RATES

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:34.985 region:rollup2
UPON A VACANCY WE'RE SEEING AN

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:36.319 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN ABUSE OF THE ELLIS

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:38.488 region:rollup2
ACT BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:39.356 region:rollup2
PROFITS TO BE MADE. IN GETTING

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:41.358 region:rollup2
OUT FROM UNDER THE RENT

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:43.126 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.827 region:rollup2
WITH RENT CONTROL. AND

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.362 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:47.030 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS ARE JUST

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:49.699 region:rollup2
TOO WEAK TO PROVIDE A REAL

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:51.167 region:rollup2
DETERRENT. IN THE FACE OF

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:53.770 region:rollup2
SKYROCKETING MARKET RENTS.

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:54.337 region:rollup2
SO THAT AND WE AGREE THAT MOST

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.972 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS YOU SALAS

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:57.407 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY WHICH IS ALL THE

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.775 region:rollup2
MORE REASON TO CRACKDOWN ON

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
THOSE UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WHO

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.011 region:rollup2
ARE CREATING HOUSING

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.579 region:rollup2
INSTABILITY.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.246 region:rollup2
AND PUTTING THOSE LAW ABIDING

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:04.648 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS AT A DISTINCT

DISADVANTAGE

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:08.852 region:rollup2
SO THESE AMENDMENTS ARE DESIGNED

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:11.021 region:rollup2

INQUIRY LAUNCHED BY CONGRESS.

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:37.626 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A BROADER PERIOD

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.794 region:rollup2
TIME THEY FOUND SIXTY ONE

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:38.994 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:40.996 region:rollup2
STE.

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:42.030 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WITH SIX

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.799 region:rollup2
RESULTING DOUBTS

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:45.767 region:rollup2
SO WHAT ON I JUST WANT TO

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:47.703 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT WHY EXISTING

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:49.071 region:rollup2
LAW ON ISN'T ENOUGH TO HANDLE

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:50.739 region:rollup2
THIS AND ONE OF THAT IS THE

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:53.442 region:rollup2
NATURE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:54.976 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DEVICES. ON MANY OF THEM

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:56.278 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:58.580 region:rollup2
THAT IN A PERFECT WORLD WOULD

01:26:56.278 --> 01:26:59.915 region:rollup2
NEVER DO ANY HARM. ON A LOT OF

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.350 region:rollup2
TIMES FOR DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:03.752 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPETING BENEFITS VERSES

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:05.954 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL HARMS.

01:27:03.752 --> 01:27:07.589 region:rollup2
ON AND SO IT IS TRUE THAT SOME

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:09.257 region:rollup2
OF THESE MEDICAL DEVICES AND

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:11.226 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICALS FAR SUIT

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:13.228 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. ACTUALLY

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:15.063 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:17.365 region:rollup2
HARM THAT COULD RESULT IN A

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:19.468 region:rollup2
SMALL NUMBER OF CASES AND SO THE

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:21.169 region:rollup2
ADS CAN BE FACTUALLY ACCURATE

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:22.370 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE DANGERS BUT IF THEY

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:23.638 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE CONTEXT IN THE

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.307 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:27.075 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM WE ALSO A

01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:27.676 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.111 region:rollup2
WITH THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL

01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:30.579 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

01:27:29.111 --> 01:27:33.882 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT ANY EFFORTS TO

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
SORT OF EXPAND ON THE ETHICAL A

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:38.487 region:rollup2
REGIME FOR ATTORNEYS IS GOOD ON

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:40.856 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE THE LIMITS ON THOSE

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:42.257 region:rollup2
ARE ONE WHO THEY CAN APPLY TO.

01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:44.226 region:rollup2
ON THAT NEEDS TO BE.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:45.827 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FOR THOSE ASSOCIATED

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:47.095 region:rollup2
WITH ATTORNEYS WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:50.198 region:rollup2
THAT MOST OF THE.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:51.700 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE INDEPENDENT AT

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:53.668 region:rollup2
FIRMS WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THAT

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.470 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THOSE ARE ALL FOCUSED

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:57.239 region:rollup2
ON ON THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:59.374 region:rollup2

WHEN IT COMES TO ATTORNEY

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:32.133 region:rollup2

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:57.225 region:rollup2
THEIR DOCTOR OR WHO MAY DECIDE

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:59.261 region:rollup2

GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:18.813 region:rollup2
THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

.

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:48.476 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AND IT COULD HAVE

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.678 region:rollup2
APPLIED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:51.012 region:rollup2

THESE DRUGS.

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:56.117 region:rollup2

CHANGES.

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:03.992 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE ACCEPTED AND STILL

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:15.904 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE.

TAKE ON THE OTHER I WOULD PREFER

01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:23.611 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THAT NONE OF THESE

01:31:22.744 --> 01:31:23.912 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENTS ARE HUNT

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2

I'M JOKING I'VE BAD AYE I DO IT

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.593 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY TELLING

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:40.328 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE AWARE

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:42.130 region:rollup2
OF THAT AT AS YOU TESTIFIED.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:44.432 region:rollup2
THE VERY SAME THINGS COULD BE

01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:46.001 region:rollup2
SAID OF ABOUT THE WHAT I FIND.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:47.335 region:rollup2
THE TRIGGERING OF

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.103 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICAL COMMERCIALS THEY

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:50.338 region:rollup2
GET PEOPLE.

01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:50.939 region:rollup2
ONTO THESE DRUGS IN THE FIRST

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:53.842 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:54.642 region:rollup2
SO I YOU KNOW HOW MANY WE DON'T

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.910 region:rollup2
HAVE THE STUDIES OF HOW MANY

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:57.245 region:rollup2
PEOPLE STOP TAKING MEDICATION

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.980 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE THEY NEVER NEEDED TO

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.781 region:rollup2
TAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.150 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE THING

01:31:59.781 --> 01:32:03.485 region:rollup2
SETTLED. THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:04.919 region:rollup2

HESITANCY AS WELL HOWEVER I

APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:17.532 region:rollup2
THAT I DO THINK THERE'S ABOUT A

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.100 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:20.535 region:rollup2
THAT IS NECESSARY ONE QUESTION

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:22.604 region:rollup2
I HAD.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:24.372 region:rollup2
I'M REGARDING.

01:32:22.604 --> 01:32:26.174 region:rollup2
WHO THE BILL IS REALLY TARGETING

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.941 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS AS WE KNOW?

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:29.844 region:rollup2
IS.

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:31.413 region:rollup2
THE WITNESS TESTIFIED IN AN

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:33.214 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION ARE CONCERNED

01:32:31.413 --> 01:32:35.016 region:rollup2
POSITION IS THAT I'M THERE ARE

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:36.851 region:rollup2
SO MANY WARS HAS I KNOW THAT THE

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:39.220 region:rollup2
AUTHOR KNOWS. BOB BEING ATTORNEY

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:40.955 region:rollup2
AS WELL THAT THAT ALREADY GUIDE

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:43.725 region:rollup2
TO ETHICS IN THE RULES AS TO

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:45.794 region:rollup2
WHAT ATTORNEYS CAN DO INCLUDING

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:46.895 region:rollup2
REGARDING ADVERTISING AND SO. I

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:47.429 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE A WITNESS CAN

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.264 region:rollup2
ELABORATE LIES TO THE THE

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:53.568 region:rollup2
TARGET.

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:54.002 region:rollup2
OF THIS OF OTHER LEGISLATION.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:56.571 region:rollup2
VERIFY THAT BECAUSE

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:57.639 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:58.573 region:rollup2
REQUIRES LITTLE CLUE LITTLE

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.608 region:rollup2
CLARITY CHIRP ABSOLUTELY.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:02.143 region:rollup2
SO IN TAKING A LOOK AT RULED

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:05.046 region:rollup2
SEVEN POINT ONE WHICH ACTUALLY

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:06.748 region:rollup2
GUIDES THIS. ON THE OVER RIDING

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:09.117 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE ABOUT THEM LEGAL

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:10.852 region:rollup2
SERVICES ADVERTISING'S IS ABOUT

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:12.487 region:rollup2
HOW YOU ARE MATERIALLY

01:33:10.852 --> 01:33:13.822 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING.

01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:15.156 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL SERVICES.

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:17.325 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:18.893 region:rollup2
THE VERY FIRST LINE OF THAT IS

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:19.961 region:rollup2
A LAWYER SHALL MAKE SHALL NOT

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:21.296 region:rollup2
MAKE A FALSE OR MISLEADING

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:23.097 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE LAWYER

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:24.732 region:rollup2
OR THE LAWYER SERVICES.

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:26.134 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:28.369 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES OUT.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:30.004 region:rollup2
CLAIMS ABOUT DEVICES OR

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:31.606 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:34.709 region:rollup2
DEFECTIVE.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:35.977 region:rollup2
AND SO THE CONCERN IS ON YOU

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:38.279 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU RUN

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:40.882 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THOSE RULES THERE

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:42.884 region:rollup2
ABOUT DON'T PROMISE A PARTICULAR

01:33:40.882 --> 01:33:44.085 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM THE LAWSUIT. DON'T

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:45.553 region:rollup2
PROMISE YOU CAN NEW YOU KNOW YOU

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:47.489 region:rollup2
CAN SPEAK SPANISH WHEN YOU DON'T

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:49.657 region:rollup2
SPEAK SPANISH DON'T YOU AND SO

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:51.659 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT. BUT YOU KNOW

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:54.496 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T APPLY.

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:57.098 region:rollup2
TO THE CLAIMS ABOUT PRODUCTS

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:59.968 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LIMIT ON IN

01:33:57.098 --> 01:34:00.168 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW FAR THEY CAN REACH.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.336 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:03.171 region:rollup2
.

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:04.672 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE LAWYERS

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:06.674 region:rollup2
I'M AND SO THAT THETHE WAY THE

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:07.909 region:rollup2
BILL AS DRAFTED IS ANYBODY WHO'S

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:09.577 region:rollup2
DOING ADVERTISING FOR LEGAL

01:34:07.909 --> 01:34:11.212 region:rollup2
SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.881 region:rollup2
OR NOT THEY'RE A LAWYER.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:15.049 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:17.752 region:rollup2
REASON WHY IT'S BEING PLACED.

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:19.621 region:rollup2
BUTTON OR UNDER THE CONSUMER.

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:22.223 region:rollup2
LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AND NOT AND

01:34:19.621 --> 01:34:23.324 region:rollup2
NOT SPECIFIC IN. BUT I'M TO BE

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:25.827 region:rollup2
JUST CONDUCT OF LAWYERS RIGHT.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:26.628 region:rollup2
AND I'M.

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:29.063 region:rollup2
YEAH AND I THINK THAT.

01:34:26.628 --> 01:34:30.632 region:rollup2
I.

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:31.666 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT THERE'S YOUR IN TERMS

01:34:30.632 --> 01:34:32.967 region:rollup2
OF FALSE OR MISLEADING

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.568 region:rollup2
ADVERTISING I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.403 region:rollup2
BE CAUTIOUS AS WELL. IN TERMS

01:34:33.568 --> 01:34:36.905 region:rollup2
OF.

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:38.706 region:rollup2
THE.

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:40.475 region:rollup2
IN OF THE OFTENTIMES WHEN

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:42.343 region:rollup2
THERE'S. ABOUT LITIGATION AFTER

01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:43.945 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT OCCUR THAT HAVE BEEN

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.847 region:rollup2
FOUND. TO HAVE BEEN

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:47.382 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED AND LAWYERS ARE

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:50.151 region:rollup2
REACHING OUT TO FIND OUT IF

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:51.986 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE VICTIM OF THAT. THAT.

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:53.555 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHERS ALSO UP ON.

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:55.490 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC GOOD IN AND THE ABILITY

01:34:53.555 --> 01:34:57.592 region:rollup2
BILL TO DO THAT AS WELL AND SO I

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:59.627 region:rollup2
A.

01:34:57.592 --> 01:35:00.862 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN FROM THE

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:01.496 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AGO THAT THIS

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.998 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THE

01:35:01.496 --> 01:35:05.767 region:rollup2
DETAILS. OF EXACTLY HOW IT'S

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:07.335 region:rollup2
AMENDED AND HOW.

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:09.370 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:11.739 region:rollup2
FINAL TEXT IS IN SO. I'M I WILL

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:13.608 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN IN

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:14.375 region:rollup2
SEEING THAT WERE CONTINUE I KNOW

01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:17.445 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:18.079 region:rollup2
FROM. THE SPONSORS AS WELL I'M.

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:19.581 region:rollup2
AS THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:21.249 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:23.051 region:rollup2
THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT.

01:35:21.249 --> 01:35:24.886 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS IS DEATHLY

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.688 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE PILLSBURY REALLY IS

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:27.956 region:rollup2
IN THE FINE PRINT. IT AS TO BUT

01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:30.825 region:rollup2
THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL LOOK LIKE

01:35:27.956 --> 01:35:32.226 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I JUST I STILL HAVE

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:33.061 region:rollup2
THAT WORRY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:35.597 region:rollup2
GO TOO FAR.

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:37.432 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S IS A VALUE TO

01:35:35.597 --> 01:35:38.299 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO GO TO MARKET

01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:40.168 region:rollup2
OPTICALLY.

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:42.837 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:44.372 region:rollup2
TWO A A PRODUCT WOULD HAVE YOU

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:46.407 region:rollup2
BEING FOUND HAVE SOME ISSUES.

01:35:44.372 --> 01:35:48.710 region:rollup2
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO. LET THE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:50.578 region:rollup2
WORLD KNOW AND AND TELEVISION OR

01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:51.279 region:rollup2
OTHER ADVERTISING.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.780 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT IS HOW

01:35:51.279 --> 01:35:55.149 region:rollup2
WE GET THAT WORD OUT THERE AND

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:56.517 region:rollup2
SO. THAT AS WE PUT PARAMETERS

01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:58.353 region:rollup2
ARE JUST TO BE CAUTIOUS AS TO

01:35:56.517 --> 01:36:00.488 region:rollup2
NOT OVERREACH. AND I KNOW THAT

01:35:58.353 --> 01:36:01.489 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN ABOVE MUCH OF THE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.190 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:04.559 region:rollup2

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.260 region:rollup2
NIBBLED THE. AS THIS BILL HAS

01:36:04.559 --> 01:36:07.662 region:rollup2
MOVED FORMER SOME OF THE

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.663 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT SO THAT. DOES MY

THE CONVERSATION THOUGH WITH

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:23.711 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IS EXTREMELY

01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:24.512 region:rollup2

THE PENALTIES TO SEVENTY

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:37.123 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:11:35.955 --> 02:11:38.991 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:11:37.123 --> 02:11:40.993 region:rollup2
THIS IS ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT.

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:42.361 region:rollup2
I'M I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:43.963 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:45.965 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT THE INDUSTRY

02:11:43.963 --> 02:11:48.134 region:rollup2
REQUESTED AND HE SEEMS TO BE

02:11:45.965 --> 02:11:49.668 region:rollup2
THAT THEY STUCK ON THIS ISSUE AN

02:11:48.134 --> 02:11:50.770 region:rollup2
OPPOSING THIS WHOLE BILL.

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:52.638 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HAVE ONE ISSUE AND THAT

02:11:50.770 --> 02:11:54.140 region:rollup2
IS.

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:56.275 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE FOR

02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.144 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO HAVE TO

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:59.078 region:rollup2
GIVE NOTICE.

02:11:58.144 --> 02:12:01.781 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO IMPOSING A FINE AND

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:03.382 region:rollup2
PENALTY.

02:12:01.781 --> 02:12:05.017 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A SITUATION

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:06.452 region:rollup2
APRAXIA NOT TO MENTION THE

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:07.953 region:rollup2
REFINERIES WE'VE HAD SOME

02:12:06.452 --> 02:12:09.388 region:rollup2
SERIOUS EXPLOSIONS ACCIDENTS

02:12:07.953 --> 02:12:11.657 region:rollup2
FIRES.

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:12.191 region:rollup2
BUT PRAXAIR AND HER ANHYDROUS

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:14.760 region:rollup2
AMMONIA WAS RELEASED THREE

02:12:12.191 --> 02:12:16.495 region:rollup2
TIMES.

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.264 region:rollup2
AND THE CURRENT GLOBAL

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:20.232 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO GIVE NOTICE

02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:21.500 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE CAN ISSUE THAT FINAL

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:22.935 region:rollup2
PENALTY SYDNEY THAT THE MAXIMUM

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:25.538 region:rollup2
FINE AND PENALTY.

02:12:22.935 --> 02:12:27.039 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S RATHER ASININE REALLY

02:12:25.538 --> 02:12:29.008 region:rollup2
DO THINK ANY ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:31.844 region:rollup2
HAS ITS HANDS TIED BEHIND ITS

02:12:29.008 --> 02:12:33.679 region:rollup2
BACK AND GO TO RADIO WAITS UNTIL

02:12:31.844 --> 02:12:34.180 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SERIOUS VIOLATION.

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:35.948 region:rollup2
UNTIL WE CAN TAKE THIS

02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.349 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE WOULDA.

02:12:35.948 --> 02:12:39.552 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT TIME THE

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:40.619 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS OPPOSED TO DESPITE

02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:42.454 region:rollup2
HAVING TAKEN PRETTY MUCH ALL THE

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:43.489 region:rollup2
OTHER AMENDMENTS.

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:45.391 region:rollup2
IS THERE SAYING THAT THE

02:12:43.489 --> 02:12:46.959 region:rollup2
STANDARD IS CHANGED.

02:12:45.391 --> 02:12:49.295 region:rollup2
WHAT WE A CERTAIN I THINK THE

02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:51.831 region:rollup2
AUTHORS COMPLETELY CORRECT?

02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:53.866 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE DRAFTED A RISK

02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:55.034 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN.

02:12:53.866 --> 02:12:56.802 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT

02:12:55.034 --> 02:12:59.371 region:rollup2
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND IF YOU

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:59.872 region:rollup2
THEN BEHIND BEHIND THE FACT THAT

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:01.574 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT

02:12:59.872 --> 02:13:02.875 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

02:13:01.574 --> 02:13:04.910 region:rollup2
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A

02:13:02.875 --> 02:13:07.213 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FINE AND PENALTY

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:09.048 region:rollup2
I ISSUED EVEN IF IT WAS A

02:13:07.213 --> 02:13:11.083 region:rollup2
SERIOUS VIOLATION THAT ALSO

02:13:09.048 --> 02:13:12.818 region:rollup2
SEEMS A LITTLE ASININE.

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:13.786 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A RISK MANAGEMENT

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:15.221 region:rollup2
PLAN YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S IN

02:13:13.786 --> 02:13:16.889 region:rollup2
THE PLAN. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT

02:13:15.221 --> 02:13:18.724 region:rollup2
YOU VIOLATE THAT THE PLAN AND

02:13:16.889 --> 02:13:21.126 region:rollup2
SHOULD SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:22.962 region:rollup2
SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T BY.

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:25.097 region:rollup2
THIS ARGUMENT FROM THE INDUSTRY.

02:13:22.962 --> 02:13:27.199 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND REDUCE ITS FINDS DOWN

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:28.834 region:rollup2
TO FIVE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:31.403 region:rollup2
DAY. THAT'S A PITTANCE FOR

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:31.904 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AS LARGE AS A REFINERY

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:34.573 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A

02:13:31.904 --> 02:13:36.141 region:rollup2
DETERRENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:38.377 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL WITNESS YEAH THE LA

02:13:36.141 --> 02:13:39.712 region:rollup2
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:40.980 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT

02:13:39.712 --> 02:13:42.448 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED TORRANCE

02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:43.816 region:rollup2
FIRE.

02:13:42.448 --> 02:13:45.751 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO HAVE EXPENSIVE IN

02:13:43.816 --> 02:13:47.319 region:rollup2
RICHMOND AND THEY KNOW THAT

02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:49.622 region:rollup2
THESE INCIDENTS.

02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:51.323 region:rollup2
SEE IT SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE THE

02:13:49.622 --> 02:13:52.758 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN THE WORKERS AND WE

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:54.093 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL

02:13:52.758 --> 02:13:56.295 region:rollup2
UPGRADE.

02:13:54.093 --> 02:13:58.797 region:rollup2
I FIND THAT'S NECESSARY TO ACT

02:13:56.295 --> 02:13:59.398 region:rollup2
AS THE PARENT BEFORE NOT OFTEN.

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:04.270 region:rollup2

THAT'S FAIR AND WORK I'M VERY

02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:15.814 region:rollup2
WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT AND.

02:19:14.346 --> 02:19:17.216 region:rollup2
AND MR IRVINE'S POINT AND THINK

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:19.051 region:rollup2
IT IS FAIR TO RETAIN NOT KNOWING

PROVISION AND THE WAY THAT WE

02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:22.621 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THIS. I'M CURRENT LAW

02:19:20.586 --> 02:19:24.189 region:rollup2

REDUCTION OF A TWO PART TEST ONE

02:19:30.362 --> 02:19:33.599 region:rollup2

I GUESS MY QUESTION TO.

02:21:35.354 --> 02:21:39.591 region:rollup2
OF THE AUTHOR THE WITNESS ABOUT

02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:42.594 region:rollup2
FOR DOING THAT IT DOES SEEM TO

02:21:40.993 --> 02:21:45.163 region:rollup2
BE A VERY COMMON.

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:46.298 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION AND IN THE LAW ONE

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:47.399 region:rollup2

I THINK THE. MATH TURNS OUT TO

02:22:02.147 --> 02:22:05.283 region:rollup2
BE LIKE FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT

02:22:03.215 --> 02:22:06.985 region:rollup2

PROVIDING A SAFE FACILITY.

02:23:26.832 --> 02:23:31.369 region:rollup2
THEN WHY NOT REFINERIES

THAT ARE.

02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:47.953 region:rollup2
LIVING IN FEAR OF THE RELEASE

02:23:46.618 --> 02:23:49.821 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

02:23:57.696 --> 02:24:03.201 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT.

THE REFINERIES.

02:24:07.105 --> 02:24:10.642 region:rollup2
TO NOT JUST

02:24:08.874 --> 02:24:12.110 region:rollup2
OF PROTECT AGAINST KNOWING

02:24:10.642 --> 02:24:13.712 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS BUT THEN TO IMPOSE

02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:16.281 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:24:13.712 --> 02:24:18.350 region:rollup2
DUTY THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW AND

02:24:16.281 --> 02:24:19.951 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD CONDUCT THE

02:24:18.350 --> 02:24:21.219 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:23.555 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THEIR SAFE FACILITIES

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:26.157 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE POINT OF.

02:24:23.555 --> 02:24:27.325 region:rollup2
THE THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE.

02:24:26.157 --> 02:24:28.460 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER IT DOES

02:24:27.325 --> 02:24:30.929 region:rollup2
RAISE THE QUESTION THOUGH THAN.

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:32.831 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:24:30.929 --> 02:24:35.500 region:rollup2
UNDER IT UNDER THIS BILL.

02:24:32.831 --> 02:24:37.435 region:rollup2
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD?

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:38.937 region:rollup2
FALL UNDER THE SECOND PART FOR

02:24:37.435 --> 02:24:40.539 region:rollup2
THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOWER

02:24:38.937 --> 02:24:41.106 region:rollup2
AMOUNT AND IT'S.

02:24:40.539 --> 02:24:41.873 region:rollup2
I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND

02:24:41.106 --> 02:24:44.009 region:rollup2
WHAT'S.

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:45.844 region:rollup2
WHAT?

02:24:44.009 --> 02:24:47.646 region:rollup2
PART B. THEN WOULD ENTAIL IRWIN

02:24:45.844 --> 02:24:49.214 region:rollup2
FACTUALLY THAT WOULD ARISE.

02:24:47.646 --> 02:24:51.349 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR THROUGH YOU MISTER

02:24:49.214 --> 02:24:53.418 region:rollup2
KENNY.

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:56.021 region:rollup2
WE WE CONCEDE THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:24:53.418 --> 02:24:57.722 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THE PROSPECT OF VERSES

02:24:56.021 --> 02:24:59.691 region:rollup2
RETROSPECTIVE ISSUE YET AND WE

02:24:57.722 --> 02:25:01.526 region:rollup2
DO INTEND TO DO THAT IT'S NOT AS

02:24:59.691 --> 02:25:02.761 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE AREN'T GRAPPLING WITH

02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:04.930 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE.

02:25:02.761 --> 02:25:07.232 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE

02:25:04.930 --> 02:25:09.501 region:rollup2
OF TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY

02:25:07.232 --> 02:25:11.469 region:rollup2
BORDERS ARE. RELATIVELY PAPER

02:25:09.501 --> 02:25:12.904 region:rollup2
VIOLATION IS VERSES A SERIOUS

02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:14.639 region:rollup2
VIOLATION.

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:16.841 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:19.411 region:rollup2
IS CONFLATING.

02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:20.879 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE ABOUT KNOWING OR

02:25:19.411 --> 02:25:22.581 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WE NOT SAYING

02:25:20.879 --> 02:25:24.182 region:rollup2
ITS INTENT.

02:25:22.581 --> 02:25:25.817 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD.

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:28.019 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SAYING THESE FOLKS ARE

02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:29.821 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO DO THIS.

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:32.691 region:rollup2
WE JUST SAYING IF YOU HAVE.

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:34.392 region:rollup2
PAID A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN.

02:25:32.691 --> 02:25:37.062 region:rollup2
AND YOUR IMPLEMENTING THAT RISK

02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:39.130 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN.

02:25:37.062 --> 02:25:41.266 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:42.634 region:rollup2
YOU EITHER NEW OR YOU SHOULD

02:25:41.266 --> 02:25:44.135 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT WE NOT EVEN SAYING YOU

02:25:42.634 --> 02:25:46.571 region:rollup2
KNEW.

02:25:44.135 --> 02:25:47.138 region:rollup2
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:48.974 region:rollup2
AND IT IS A QUESTION OF DUE

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:50.675 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE.

02:25:48.974 --> 02:25:52.744 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT GO OFF TO THE FACT

02:25:50.675 --> 02:25:55.180 region:rollup2
ONCE THE INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED

02:25:52.744 --> 02:25:56.848 region:rollup2
ONCE THE FIRE HAS OCCURRED AND

02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:59.084 region:rollup2
THEN IMPOSE A FINE AND PENALTY.

02:25:56.848 --> 02:26:01.286 region:rollup2
OR LIKE IN THE CASE OF PRAXAIR

02:25:59.084 --> 02:26:02.821 region:rollup2
RACK UP THE FREE VIOLATIONS

02:26:01.286 --> 02:26:04.389 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE CAN STEP IN ND

02:26:02.821 --> 02:26:05.790 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY HAS CONCEDED TO THAT

02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:07.258 region:rollup2
POINT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:08.660 region:rollup2
ISSUE NOTICE.

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:09.861 region:rollup2
ARE INTENT IS AN ENFORCEMENT

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:11.997 region:rollup2
AGENCY

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:13.264 region:rollup2
IT'S TO EXPECT THOSE PEOPLE IF

02:26:11.997 --> 02:26:14.933 region:rollup2
THEY ARE WRITING A RISK

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:17.469 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN.

02:26:14.933 --> 02:26:18.203 region:rollup2
TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PLAN

02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:19.904 region:rollup2
AND TO EXERCISE THE DO JUST

02:26:18.203 --> 02:26:20.772 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:22.641 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT

02:26:20.772 --> 02:26:24.242 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY LIVING HERE A

02:26:22.641 --> 02:26:26.578 region:rollup2
VALVE LEAK.

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:28.179 region:rollup2
WAYNE PINCH ME OPENING SOMETHING

02:26:26.578 --> 02:26:29.281 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT THE

02:26:28.179 --> 02:26:31.416 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION IS FROM OUR

02:26:29.281 --> 02:26:33.418 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T THINK THAT

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:36.221 region:rollup2
KNOWN OR SHOULD KNOW. IS SUCH A

02:26:33.418 --> 02:26:38.690 region:rollup2
BIG STEP IF YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO

02:26:36.221 --> 02:26:40.091 region:rollup2
WRITE THIS PAN AND FOLLOW IT.

02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:41.626 region:rollup2
CAN I JUST BRIEFLY ASK THE

02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:43.662 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WITNESS TO ADDRESS

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:45.797 region:rollup2
THE THAT WE DO HAVE YOUR SPONSOR

02:26:43.662 --> 02:26:47.465 region:rollup2
WHAT HE JUST SAID.

02:26:45.797 --> 02:26:49.834 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THERE'S NO

02:26:47.465 --> 02:26:50.902 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENT CONDUCT

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:52.837 region:rollup2
WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:54.506 region:rollup2
SIMPLY SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:57.008 region:rollup2
BE A DIFFERENCE.

02:26:54.506 --> 02:26:58.943 region:rollup2
IN THE PENALTY FOR NEGLIGENT AND

02:26:57.008 --> 02:27:00.745 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:03.148 region:rollup2
AGAIN NOT A RADICAL IDEA.

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:03.615 region:rollup2
.

02:27:03.148 --> 02:27:05.383 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S ALL WE'RE

02:27:03.615 --> 02:27:08.453 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING.

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:11.456 region:rollup2
WE WE OBJECT TO THE.

02:27:08.453 --> 02:27:13.458 region:rollup2
EQUAL TREATMENT OF NEGLIGENT.

02:27:11.456 --> 02:27:15.193 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT AND INTENTIONAL

02:27:13.458 --> 02:27:17.295 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT IF WE PER PARA PLAYER

02:27:15.193 --> 02:27:19.364 region:rollup2
AND AND VIOLATED OF COURSE WE

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:22.100 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME LIABILITY.

02:27:19.364 --> 02:27:24.502 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE LOWER STANDARD.

02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.404 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S UNUSUAL FOR

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:29.274 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO COME UP HERE AND IT

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:30.709 region:rollup2
JACKED TO CONFLATING INTENTIONAL

02:27:29.274 --> 02:27:32.444 region:rollup2
AND NEGLIGENT MISCONDUCT THEY'RE

THE SAME FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS

02:27:33.912 --> 02:27:37.649 region:rollup2
WE WOULD SUGGEST A DIFFERENT

02:27:35.447 --> 02:27:39.351 region:rollup2
PENALTY SHOULD ATTACH. WE'RE NOT

02:27:37.649 --> 02:27:40.618 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR IMMUNITY.

02:27:39.351 --> 02:27:42.921 region:rollup2
WE ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SHOULD BE

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:45.223 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR

02:27:42.921 --> 02:27:48.360 region:rollup2
BUT NOT THE SAME PENALTY AS

02:35:17.241 --> 02:35:21.045 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD AB TWENTY SIX FORTY

02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:23.381 region:rollup2
SEVEN DOES NOT DO THAT IT DOES

02:35:21.045 --> 02:35:24.715 region:rollup2
NOT. PROVIDE CONCRETE PRACTICES

02:35:23.381 --> 02:35:25.283 region:rollup2
A BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW THAT IS

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:27.151 region:rollup2
WHAT AB TEN NO WAY DID LAST

02:35:25.283 --> 02:35:28.519 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:29.787 region:rollup2
AB TUNNEL EIGHT AGAIN PROVIDE A

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:31.455 region:rollup2
CLEAR CONCRETE PRACTICES A

02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:33.024 region:rollup2
BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW WHICH WOULD

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:35.226 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THE REST WERE NEGLIGENT

02:35:33.024 --> 02:35:36.594 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT HIRING RISK ARE

02:35:35.226 --> 02:35:38.896 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUIT.

02:35:36.594 --> 02:35:40.598 region:rollup2
SO IF THE EMPLOYER FOLLOWS THE

02:35:38.896 --> 02:35:41.866 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES THE GUIDANCE THE

02:35:40.598 --> 02:35:43.167 region:rollup2
ROADMAP THAT'S PROVIDED IN IT AB

02:35:41.866 --> 02:35:44.335 region:rollup2
TEN NO WAIT THEY WOULD BE

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:45.436 region:rollup2
MINIMIZING THE RISK TO ANOTHER

02:35:44.335 --> 02:35:46.404 region:rollup2
AND HIRING LAWSUIT BECAUSE IT

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:47.805 region:rollup2
WOULD. SHOW THAT THEY WERE

02:35:46.404 --> 02:35:49.373 region:rollup2
EXERCISING THEIR THEIR DUE

02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:51.509 region:rollup2
DILIGENCE TO SEE IF THERE WAS

02:35:49.373 --> 02:35:53.244 region:rollup2
ANY FORESEEABLE RISK. THAT THAT

02:35:51.509 --> 02:35:53.744 region:rollup2
THIS NEW HIRE WOULD POSE HARM TO

02:35:53.244 --> 02:35:56.414 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE.

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:58.015 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:35:56.414 --> 02:35:59.817 region:rollup2
SO THIS ON THE OTHER HAND THIS

02:35:58.015 --> 02:36:01.452 region:rollup2
JUST PROVIDES WHAT WE SEE AS AN

02:35:59.817 --> 02:36:03.187 region:rollup2
OVERBROAD UNNECESSARY

02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:05.456 region:rollup2
EVIDENTIARY EXCEPTION THAT

02:36:03.187 --> 02:36:07.325 region:rollup2
REALLY JUST REINFORCES THESE

02:36:05.456 --> 02:36:09.293 region:rollup2
HARMFUL STEREOTYPES AN INHERENT

02:36:07.325 --> 02:36:10.695 region:rollup2
BIASES AB TEN ONLY. REALLY

02:36:09.293 --> 02:36:12.296 region:rollup2
SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE.

02:36:10.695 --> 02:36:14.165 region:rollup2
SO IF WE ARE IN FACT JUST

02:36:12.296 --> 02:36:16.167 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT NEGLIGENT HIRING

02:36:14.165 --> 02:36:18.002 region:rollup2
CLAIMS THIS BILL REALLY IS

02:36:16.167 --> 02:36:20.705 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY IT LAYS OUT THREE

02:36:18.002 --> 02:36:21.739 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS ONE NO ONE ON CRIME

02:36:20.705 --> 02:36:23.774 region:rollup2
CONVICTION HISTORY WOULD BE IN

02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:24.976 region:rollup2
IT IT ADMISSIBLE. SO FIRST IT

02:36:23.774 --> 02:36:26.510 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE IF IT DOES

02:36:24.976 --> 02:36:28.079 region:rollup2
NOT BEAR A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:29.513 region:rollup2
TO THE FACTS UNDERLYINGCIVIL

02:36:28.079 --> 02:36:32.016 region:rollup2
ACTION. WHICH IS WHAT A

02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:34.085 region:rollup2
RELEVANCY STANDARD IS FOR IF IF

02:36:32.016 --> 02:36:35.553 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT RELEVANT IF THE

02:36:34.085 --> 02:36:36.687 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS NOT RELEVANT.

02:36:35.553 --> 02:36:37.989 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS IT DOES NOT BEAR

02:36:36.687 --> 02:36:39.323 region:rollup2
DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE FACTS

02:36:37.989 --> 02:36:41.125 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING CIVIL ACTION THEN IT

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:42.593 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE. THE

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:44.662 region:rollup2
SECOND PRONG IT SAYS.

02:36:42.593 --> 02:36:46.731 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION IS INADMISSIBLE

02:36:44.662 --> 02:36:48.933 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE. IF THIS CONVICTION

02:36:46.731 --> 02:36:51.168 region:rollup2
IS SEALED REVERSED OR VACATED

02:36:48.933 --> 02:36:53.004 region:rollup2
PARDON DISMISSED ARE EXPUNGED.

02:36:51.168 --> 02:36:55.106 region:rollup2
AND ALL THOSE INSTANCES UNDER

02:36:53.004 --> 02:36:55.740 region:rollup2
AB TEN AWAY AND UNDER LABOR CODE

02:36:55.106 --> 02:36:56.841 region:rollup2
SECTION FOUR THIRTY TWO POINT

02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:58.142 region:rollup2
SEVEN AND AN EMPLOYER COULD

02:36:56.841 --> 02:36:59.777 region:rollup2
NEVER EVEN CONSIDER THAT

02:36:58.142 --> 02:37:01.078 region:rollup2
CONVICTION HISTORY ANYWAY. SO

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:02.346 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE

02:37:01.078 --> 02:37:04.015 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WOULD GO INTO

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:05.249 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HIRING LAWSUIT. THE

02:37:04.015 --> 02:37:06.951 region:rollup2
THIRD PRONG SAYS OF THE CRIMINAL

02:37:05.249 --> 02:37:08.152 region:rollup2
HISTORY CONSISTS OF AN ARRESTOR

02:37:06.951 --> 02:37:09.654 region:rollup2
CHARGE A DID NOT RESULT IN A

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:12.089 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND AGAIN

02:37:09.654 --> 02:37:12.723 region:rollup2
UNDER A BE TOTALLY AND UTTERLY

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:14.458 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ACTION FOR THIRTY TWO

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:16.060 region:rollup2
POINT SEVEN. AN EMPLOYER CANNOT

02:37:14.458 --> 02:37:16.927 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE INFORMATION THEY

02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:18.596 region:rollup2
CANNOT CONSIDER AN ARREST THAT

02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:20.431 region:rollup2
DOES NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION

02:37:18.596 --> 02:37:22.099 region:rollup2
SO THAT INFORMATION ALSO WOULD

02:37:20.431 --> 02:37:22.967 region:rollup2
NOT COME IN FOR ANOTHER IN

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:25.069 region:rollup2
HIRING. LAWSUIT

02:37:22.967 --> 02:37:26.570 region:rollup2
SO. IN THAT SENSE IT'S IT'S

02:37:25.069 --> 02:37:27.939 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY BUT THE BILL'S ALSO

02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:29.206 region:rollup2
OVER BROUGHT IT DOESN'T APPLY

02:37:27.939 --> 02:37:31.175 region:rollup2
JUST TO NEGLIGENT HIRING

02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:32.576 region:rollup2
LAWSUITS APPLIES TO ANY ACTION

02:37:31.175 --> 02:37:34.245 region:rollup2
ANY CIVIL ACTION AGAINST AN

02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:36.714 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYERS AGENTS OR

02:37:34.245 --> 02:37:37.848 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS. OTHER EMPLOYEES SO

02:37:36.714 --> 02:37:39.250 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE OF

02:37:37.848 --> 02:37:40.651 region:rollup2
OTHER CASES WHERE THERE MIGHT BE

02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:42.687 region:rollup2
TORTIOUS CONDUCT WHERE A

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:43.888 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY

02:37:42.687 --> 02:37:45.756 region:rollup2
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE RELEVANT.

02:37:43.888 --> 02:37:47.525 region:rollup2
.

02:37:45.756 --> 02:37:48.426 region:rollup2
I DO NEED EUROPE OKAY THE LAST

02:37:47.525 --> 02:37:50.928 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT IS THAT.

02:37:48.426 --> 02:37:52.596 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ONE SIDED THIS BILL

02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:53.931 region:rollup2
ONLY MAKES THE INFORMATION AND

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:56.300 region:rollup2
INVINCIBLE.

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:58.669 region:rollup2
AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE SO

02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:00.037 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY UNDER THE SPELL OF A

02:37:58.669 --> 02:38:02.073 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFF WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

02:38:00.037 --> 02:38:03.674 region:rollup2
USE CONVICTION HISTORY OTHER

02:38:02.073 --> 02:38:05.176 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. AN

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:07.478 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER OR ITS AGENTS OR ITS

02:38:05.176 --> 02:38:09.814 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES. BUT THE EMPLOYER

02:38:07.478 --> 02:38:11.015 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY USE CONVICTION

02:38:09.814 --> 02:38:12.984 region:rollup2
HISTORY AGAINST THE PLAINTIVE.

02:38:11.015 --> 02:38:14.352 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW AGAIN IF WE THINK

02:38:12.984 --> 02:38:15.786 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH

02:38:14.352 --> 02:38:16.954 region:rollup2
LEGALLY BUT TO LEGALLY

02:38:15.786 --> 02:38:17.888 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED CLEARING CONCRETE

02:38:16.954 --> 02:38:18.956 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THE BUSINESS CAN

02:38:17.888 --> 02:38:20.591 region:rollup2
FOLLOW TO AVOID A NEGLIGENT

02:38:18.956 --> 02:38:22.159 region:rollup2
HIRING LAWSUIT. WE THINK THAT

02:38:20.591 --> 02:38:24.228 region:rollup2
MEANS MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:25.329 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION OUTREACH ENSURING

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:26.530 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH A. B. TUNNEL AND

02:38:25.329 --> 02:38:27.998 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:30.034 region:rollup2
OPPOSED.

02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:31.002 region:rollup2

RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS

02:38:34.305 --> 02:38:38.843 region:rollup2
BILL ANALYSTS AT ECHO THE

02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:39.343 region:rollup2
COMMENTS OF MISTER ISHIHARA.

02:38:38.843 --> 02:38:41.379 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

02:38:39.343 --> 02:38:42.013 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

02:38:41.379 --> 02:38:42.546 region:rollup2
THREE ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER

02:38:42.013 --> 02:38:44.515 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS THE CALIFORNIAN

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:45.015 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

02:38:44.515 --> 02:38:46.650 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:47.752 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:50.187 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE I'M GONNA BRING IT

02:38:47.752 --> 02:38:51.489 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:53.257 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE I. APPRECIATE THAT

02:38:51.489 --> 02:38:56.560 region:rollup2
THIS IS A COMPLEX CONVERSATION

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:57.628 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT TRYING TO SUPPORT.

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:58.796 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS

02:38:57.628 --> 02:39:00.498 region:rollup2
GETTING INTO THE WORK FORCE AND

02:38:58.796 --> 02:39:01.732 region:rollup2
HELPING BUSINESSES

02:39:00.498 --> 02:39:03.000 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THAT AND I THINK

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:05.136 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BASIC GOAL HERE AND

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.704 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S.

02:39:05.136 --> 02:39:08.939 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WORD THE NOTION.

02:39:06.704 --> 02:39:10.374 region:rollup2
FOR ME THOUGH.

02:39:08.939 --> 02:39:11.475 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT

02:39:10.374 --> 02:39:13.244 region:rollup2
OR I DON'T THINK WE'LL IT WILL

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:14.612 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THAT SO I'M NOT GOING

02:39:13.244 --> 02:39:15.713 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY.

02:39:14.612 --> 02:39:18.449 region:rollup2
AND IT DOES POTENTIALLY GO

02:39:15.713 --> 02:39:20.684 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT.

02:39:18.449 --> 02:39:22.286 region:rollup2
WHAT IT STATED AND THAT AND THAT

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:24.355 region:rollup2
DOES CONCERN ME WHERE?

02:39:22.286 --> 02:39:26.090 region:rollup2
THOUGH BECAUSE THE CONVICTION

02:39:24.355 --> 02:39:27.758 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OR THAT EVIDENCE

02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:29.093 region:rollup2
USUALLY WE EXCLUDE THAT TO TO

02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:30.428 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

02:39:29.093 --> 02:39:32.530 region:rollup2
BEING HIRED.

02:39:30.428 --> 02:39:33.597 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE RULES

02:39:32.530 --> 02:39:35.132 region:rollup2
WOULD ALREADY SUPPORT THE

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:36.500 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IN A NEGLIGENT HIRING

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:39.069 region:rollup2
SITUATION REMEMBER THE BAND THE

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:40.738 region:rollup2
BOX TO.

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:42.073 region:rollup2
PANTS THE BOX UP FRONT BUT STILL

02:39:40.738 --> 02:39:44.075 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER TO DO THEIR

02:39:42.073 --> 02:39:45.943 region:rollup2
DUE DILIGENCE ON THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:39:44.075 --> 02:39:46.877 region:rollup2
AND HAVING RUN BILLS IN THIS

02:39:45.943 --> 02:39:49.346 region:rollup2
AREA AND DEALING WITH A NUMBER

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:50.881 region:rollup2
OF. CATEGORIES OF INDUSTRY.

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:53.517 region:rollup2
WHO WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:39:50.881 --> 02:39:54.819 region:rollup2
THAT?

02:39:53.517 --> 02:39:56.320 region:rollup2
STATUTES THAT WE HAVE DONE SO

02:39:54.819 --> 02:39:57.888 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.156 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW AND AND. MAKE

02:39:57.888 --> 02:40:01.058 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE DECISIONS ABOUT

02:39:59.156 --> 02:40:02.560 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WE WE'VE REALLY TRIED

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:04.995 region:rollup2
TO TO SORT OF WORK THAT THAT

02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.063 region:rollup2
BALANCE SIDE WOULD RATHER THAT

02:40:04.995 --> 02:40:07.631 region:rollup2
WE SEE WE GIVE THE LOVE. A

02:40:06.063 --> 02:40:09.400 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:11.102 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:12.636 region:rollup2
BETTER THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT

02:40:11.102 --> 02:40:14.038 region:rollup2
DOES REPRESENT ISSUES FOR

02:40:12.636 --> 02:40:16.273 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND THAT AND THAT WE

02:40:14.038 --> 02:40:17.541 region:rollup2
CAN FINE. TUNE THE LAW IN VERY

02:40:16.273 --> 02:40:19.643 region:rollup2
SELECTED AREAS RATHER THAN THAN

02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:21.145 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

02:40:19.643 --> 02:40:22.780 region:rollup2
QUITE SO BROAD AS THAT SO I I

02:40:21.145 --> 02:40:24.982 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE NOTION AND AND

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.383 region:rollup2
WANTING TO HELP IN THIS AREA FOR

02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:27.518 region:rollup2
ME RIGHT NOW JUST NOT SURE THAT

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:28.786 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH I'M

02:40:27.518 --> 02:40:29.920 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE A LIST.

02:40:28.786 --> 02:40:30.721 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WHAT WITH ALL DUE

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.057 region:rollup2
RESPECT I THINK.

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:34.492 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE HE IN A PART OF THE A

02:46:02.286 --> 02:46:07.124 region:rollup2
SO MUCH TO TRY TO GET THE RIGHT

02:46:04.188 --> 02:46:09.059 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO GET. THE THE THE

02:46:07.124 --> 02:46:12.162 region:rollup2
CHAMBER TO GET A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:46:09.059 --> 02:46:13.764 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. TO

02:46:12.162 --> 02:46:14.364 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS NOT

02:46:13.764 --> 02:46:16.700 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THE FORMALLY

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:18.535 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED BUT ALSO FOR THOSE

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:20.337 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WHO WERE GOING TO.

02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:22.339 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM THE JOBS.

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:24.241 region:rollup2
AND IT INITIALLY WHEN I READ THE

02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:25.542 region:rollup2
BILL I THOUGHT OKAY SO NAY OUT

02:46:24.241 --> 02:46:26.944 region:rollup2
JUST A PROTECTION FOR THE

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:28.745 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

02:46:26.944 --> 02:46:30.347 region:rollup2
BUT AS I READ THROUGH IT FURTHER

02:46:28.745 --> 02:46:32.850 region:rollup2
I REALIZE THAT IF. IF THE

02:46:30.347 --> 02:46:35.052 region:rollup2
OBJECTION IS.

02:46:32.850 --> 02:46:37.020 region:rollup2
INTRODUCING RELEVANT.

THERE'S ALREADY OBJECTION FOR

02:46:38.822 --> 02:46:42.559 region:rollup2
SO IF IT'S IRRELEVANT TO

WHATEVER THE ACTION IS IT'S NOT

02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:45.496 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY ANY

02:46:43.794 --> 02:46:48.332 region:rollup2

THEY THEREAFTER CAN DO THE

02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:04.748 region:rollup2
RESEARCH TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR

02:47:02.379 --> 02:47:06.817 region:rollup2
NOT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:07.317 region:rollup2
HIRING OF A PARTICULAR PERSON

02:47:06.817 --> 02:47:09.152 region:rollup2

PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYER.

02:47:12.022 --> 02:47:14.625 region:rollup2

02:47:13.624 --> 02:47:16.126 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL

02:47:14.625 --> 02:47:17.461 region:rollup2

SITUATION LIKE OURS.

SOMEONE WHO HAD SIGNED A NON

PATENTLY OFFENSIVE WE'VE SEEN IT

03:01:09.659 --> 03:01:12.595 region:rollup2
HERE WE SEEN IT ACROSS A NUMBER

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:14.263 region:rollup2
OF ORGANIZATIONS WHERE SOMEONE

03:01:12.595 --> 03:01:15.898 region:rollup2
WHO'S BEEN VICTIMIZED. GETS RE

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:17.400 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATION.

03:01:21.104 --> 03:01:25.775 region:rollup2
THIS DOES GET TO BE.

03:01:23.306 --> 03:01:26.309 region:rollup2
A CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AS

03:01:25.775 --> 03:01:27.510 region:rollup2

03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:30.113 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT ORGANIZATION IS WHO

03:01:28.811 --> 03:01:32.014 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:01:30.113 --> 03:01:33.282 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER OF

03:01:32.014 --> 03:01:35.051 region:rollup2
COMMERCE ON THIS TO MAKE SURE

03:01:33.282 --> 03:01:36.519 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DEFINING IT VERY

03:01:35.051 --> 03:01:38.821 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY I THINK IT'S CLEAR?

03:01:36.519 --> 03:01:39.856 region:rollup2
IN A PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS

03:01:38.821 --> 03:01:41.390 region:rollup2

03:01:39.856 --> 03:01:41.924 region:rollup2
AND PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS

03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:43.526 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN

03:01:41.924 --> 03:01:45.094 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER TO SORT

03:01:43.526 --> 03:01:46.829 region:rollup2
THROUGH DEFINITIONS AND ENSURE

03:01:45.094 --> 03:01:48.231 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE. SOMETHING THAT

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:49.899 region:rollup2
WILL PASS THROUGH A BUT WILL

03:01:48.231 --> 03:01:51.768 region:rollup2
ALSO REALLY START TO ADDRESS

03:01:49.899 --> 03:01:54.504 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE. THAT'S WHAT THIS

03:01:51.768 --> 03:01:58.341 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF THE

03:02:01.177 --> 03:02:03.413 region:rollup2

I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT

03:02:06.716 --> 03:02:09.585 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF

THE MANY THINGS THAT ARE BECOME

03:02:09.585 --> 03:02:12.822 region:rollup2
GLARINGLY OBVIOUS IN THE ME TOO

03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:14.090 region:rollup2

OF THESE HIGH PROFILE CASES. I

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:25.535 region:rollup2
THINK THIS MISCONDUCT WAS ABLE

03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:26.669 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE BECAUSE OF THE NON

03:02:25.535 --> 03:02:28.638 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT

03:02:26.669 --> 03:02:29.839 region:rollup2
REALLY SILENCED THESE VICTIMS

03:02:28.638 --> 03:02:31.441 region:rollup2
AND IN THE LARRY NASSER CASE IN

03:02:29.839 --> 03:02:32.742 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PREVENTED THEM FROM

03:02:31.441 --> 03:02:34.544 region:rollup2
EVEN TESTIFYING IN A CRIMINAL

03:02:32.742 --> 03:02:35.945 region:rollup2
PROCEEDING. THIS DOES HAPPEN IN

03:02:34.544 --> 03:02:37.013 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT AS WELL.

03:02:35.945 --> 03:02:38.915 region:rollup2

THE COMPANY.

03:02:42.351 --> 03:02:45.021 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES HAD TO SIGN

THEM WERE PART OF A SETTLEMENT

03:02:46.055 --> 03:02:49.125 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT SOME ARE JUST AS A

03:02:47.223 --> 03:02:50.860 region:rollup2
CONDITION OF HIGHER. BUT THIS

03:02:49.125 --> 03:02:51.928 region:rollup2
REALLY DID PREVENT THESE WORKERS

03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:52.895 region:rollup2
FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE

03:02:51.928 --> 03:02:55.064 region:rollup2

SOMEBODY OWNS FIVE MCDONALDS IT

03:06:04.954 --> 03:06:07.957 region:rollup2

FIVE MCDONALDS IS GOING TO BE.

03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:14.797 region:rollup2

THAT.

03:21:17.332 --> 03:21:21.469 region:rollup2
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE HANDLE

03:21:19.467 --> 03:21:22.137 region:rollup2
ON OUR EXPENSES. AS WE WOULD

03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:24.506 region:rollup2

QUESTION A REAL STATE DECISIONS

03:21:36.318 --> 03:21:39.387 region:rollup2

WAS GONNA BE PART OF THIS BILL

03:21:39.387 --> 03:21:44.359 region:rollup2
WAS. REAL TRUE ZERO BASED

03:21:41.790 --> 03:21:46.094 region:rollup2
BUDGETING ARE THIS IS.

03:21:44.359 --> 03:21:47.662 region:rollup2

WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:21:54.936 --> 03:21:57.739 region:rollup2
THAT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS

03:21:56.004 --> 03:22:00.175 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. OF I KNOW THAT THE

03:21:57.739 --> 03:22:01.943 region:rollup2
BAR HAD CONCERNS WITH ZERO BASED

03:22:00.175 --> 03:22:03.478 region:rollup2

THAT. COULD YOU GIVE US A

03:22:06.381 --> 03:22:08.516 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON WHY THAT WOULD BE

03:22:08.183 --> 03:22:11.219 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

AND ITS MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION

03:22:20.295 --> 03:22:23.431 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT

03:22:21.930 --> 03:22:25.233 region:rollup2
WE SPENT ARMS A COUPLE MILLION

03:22:23.431 --> 03:22:26.868 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND THOUSANDS OF STAFF

03:22:25.233 --> 03:22:28.970 region:rollup2
HOURS DOING THAT.

WE ARE TRANSPORT WE UNDERSTAND

03:22:28.970 --> 03:22:32.107 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT

03:22:30.372 --> 03:22:33.541 region:rollup2
HOW WE MANAGE PUBLIC RESOURCES

03:22:32.107 --> 03:22:34.743 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CASE TO

03:22:33.541 --> 03:22:36.811 region:rollup2
MAKE TO YOU BEFORE WE ASK FOR A

THAT YOU THINK ARE NEEDED BUT WE

03:22:41.149 --> 03:22:43.318 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE EFFORT

03:22:42.684 --> 03:22:44.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING

03:22:43.318 --> 03:22:46.421 region:rollup2
FOR THIS.

03:22:44.386 --> 03:22:48.289 region:rollup2
WE WANT IT TO BE ACHIEVABLE IN

03:22:46.421 --> 03:22:49.724 region:rollup2

03:23:04.639 --> 03:23:08.243 region:rollup2
WOOD.

03:23:06.241 --> 03:23:09.444 region:rollup2
REALLY CUT TO THE CORE OF WHAT

03:23:08.243 --> 03:23:10.879 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A VERY

03:23:09.444 --> 03:23:12.213 region:rollup2
HEALTHY AVOID THE NEED FOR

03:23:10.879 --> 03:23:14.516 region:rollup2
FUTURE AUDITS BUT.

03:23:12.213 --> 03:23:16.684 region:rollup2
I I AM I AM.

03:23:14.516 --> 03:23:18.586 region:rollup2
A.

03:23:16.684 --> 03:23:19.120 region:rollup2
IT WHILE I WOULD PREFER ZERO

03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:21.089 region:rollup2
BASED BUDGETING.

BILL FORWARD.

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:27.495 region:rollup2
BUT UNDERSTANDING FOR ME THAT

03:23:25.560 --> 03:23:28.063 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT IN THE STUDY THAT'S

03:23:27.495 --> 03:23:29.831 region:rollup2
BEEN CALLED FOR IN THIS BAR

03:23:28.063 --> 03:23:31.266 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:23:29.831 --> 03:23:32.934 region:rollup2
REALLY REPRESENTS I THINK AGAIN

03:23:31.266 --> 03:23:34.135 region:rollup2
THE BARE MINIMUM OF WHAT WE

03:23:32.934 --> 03:23:35.370 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE AUDIT

03:23:34.135 --> 03:23:36.638 region:rollup2
APART SPENCE'S SO I'M LOOKING

03:23:35.370 --> 03:23:38.039 region:rollup2

03:23:38.039 --> 03:23:41.009 region:rollup2
AND MOVING FORWARD FROM THERE.

03:23:39.708 --> 03:23:42.210 region:rollup2
ARM ON A SEPARATE TOPIC IN THIS

03:23:41.009 --> 03:23:42.911 region:rollup2
IS ONE THAT I'VE DISCUSSED I

03:23:42.210 --> 03:23:44.879 region:rollup2
THINK WITH ALL THE PARTIES

03:23:42.911 --> 03:23:46.881 region:rollup2
INVOLVED. OF THE TOPIC OF

03:23:44.879 --> 03:23:49.050 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY AND JUST A LITTLE BIT

03:23:46.881 --> 03:23:51.319 region:rollup2
OF CONTEXT AS WAS NOTED IN THE

03:23:49.050 --> 03:23:54.522 region:rollup2
STAFF ANALYSIS AT THIS MOMENT.

03:23:51.319 --> 03:23:55.156 region:rollup2
IN OUR CALIFORNIA STATE BAR

03:23:54.522 --> 03:23:57.926 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE ATTORNEYS

03:23:55.156 --> 03:23:59.861 region:rollup2
ARE WHITE. ARE AT A TIME WHEN.

03:23:57.926 --> 03:24:01.396 region:rollup2
Y. CALIFORNIANS MAKE UP THIRTY

03:23:59.861 --> 03:24:03.698 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION

03:24:01.396 --> 03:24:05.433 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOR FOR

03:24:03.698 --> 03:24:07.669 region:rollup2
NON WHITE ATTORNEYS.

03:24:05.433 --> 03:24:09.070 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DO NOT

03:24:07.669 --> 03:24:09.270 region:rollup2
REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE STATE

03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:10.505 region:rollup2
PARK.

03:24:09.270 --> 03:24:11.973 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THIS.

03:24:10.505 --> 03:24:13.141 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF

03:24:11.973 --> 03:24:14.976 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR.

03:24:13.141 --> 03:24:17.011 region:rollup2
INTERACT TYPICALLY WITH WITH

03:24:14.976 --> 03:24:18.680 region:rollup2
ETHNIC PARSIS YOU ASIANS OR

03:24:17.011 --> 03:24:20.381 region:rollup2
WOMEN'S BAR ASSOCIATIONS ARE

03:24:18.680 --> 03:24:21.916 region:rollup2
LGBT BAR ASSOCIATIONS.

03:24:20.381 --> 03:24:23.184 region:rollup2
AND AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE

03:24:21.916 --> 03:24:24.285 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE

03:24:23.184 --> 03:24:26.154 region:rollup2
LARGEST ETHNIC BAR ASSOCIATIONS

03:24:24.285 --> 03:24:27.889 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

03:24:26.154 --> 03:24:29.324 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF A

03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:30.658 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION AND I THINK A REALITY

03:24:29.324 --> 03:24:32.494 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE BAR HAS NOT

03:24:30.658 --> 03:24:34.262 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON ISSUES OF DIVERSITY

03:24:32.494 --> 03:24:36.431 region:rollup2
AND ADVANCEMENT. AND ACCESS TO

03:24:34.262 --> 03:24:36.865 region:rollup2
JUSTICE IN IN A WAY THAT WE

03:24:36.431 --> 03:24:38.266 region:rollup2
WOULD WE WOULD HOPE.

03:24:36.865 --> 03:24:40.368 region:rollup2
.

03:24:38.266 --> 03:24:43.271 region:rollup2
THERE AS YOU KNOW BEEN SOME

03:24:40.368 --> 03:24:44.105 region:rollup2
CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT A ABOUT

03:24:43.271 --> 03:24:45.673 region:rollup2
DECENTRALIZING THE FOCUS OF

03:24:44.105 --> 03:24:46.975 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY.

03:24:45.673 --> 03:24:48.409 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BAR IT USED TO BE

03:24:46.975 --> 03:24:49.844 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS A A UNIT WITHIN

03:24:48.409 --> 03:24:52.013 region:rollup2
THE BAR THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON

03:24:49.844 --> 03:24:54.249 region:rollup2
THIS AND. NOW THE PROPOSAL IS TO

03:24:52.013 --> 03:24:55.984 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DISBAND THAT AND TO.

03:24:54.249 --> 03:24:58.219 region:rollup2
WITH THE EYE OF OF HOPEFULLY

03:24:55.984 --> 03:24:59.554 region:rollup2
IMBUING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

03:24:58.219 --> 03:25:00.855 region:rollup2
THE BAR ARE A COMMITMENT TO

03:24:59.554 --> 03:25:01.456 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY BUT AT THIS MOMENT

03:25:00.855 --> 03:25:03.491 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT YET. IN PLACE AND

03:25:01.456 --> 03:25:04.826 region:rollup2
SO.

03:25:03.491 --> 03:25:06.194 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS IS AN

03:25:04.826 --> 03:25:07.629 region:rollup2
AREA THAT I'M GONNA BE VERY

03:25:06.194 --> 03:25:09.531 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THIS COMING YEAR. I

03:25:07.629 --> 03:25:12.567 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE IN THIS BAR BILL.

03:25:09.531 --> 03:25:15.036 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE AN ANALYSIS OF OF

03:25:12.567 --> 03:25:16.437 region:rollup2
OF HOW DIVERSITY IS IS ADDRESSED

03:25:15.036 --> 03:25:18.139 region:rollup2
AND WHAT AS.

03:25:16.437 --> 03:25:19.741 region:rollup2
A STATE BAR WE COULD DO TO FOCUS

03:25:18.139 --> 03:25:21.442 region:rollup2
ON UP PROMOTING.

03:25:19.741 --> 03:25:23.912 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

03:25:21.442 --> 03:25:25.647 region:rollup2
TO ALL ON BUT IT'S A IT'S ONE

03:25:23.912 --> 03:25:26.514 region:rollup2
THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

03:25:25.647 --> 03:25:28.383 region:rollup2
AND AND FRANKLY HAD THOUGHT

03:25:26.514 --> 03:25:30.285 region:rollup2
ABOUT NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL

03:25:28.383 --> 03:25:31.352 region:rollup2
FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON. ARM I

03:25:30.285 --> 03:25:32.820 region:rollup2
THINK SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:35.089 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT.

03:25:32.820 --> 03:25:38.193 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA BARS STANDARDS

03:25:35.089 --> 03:25:41.296 region:rollup2
AND THE IMPACT OF A PASSING

03:25:38.193 --> 03:25:42.931 region:rollup2
SCORE LEVELS ON DIVERSITY WITHIN

03:25:41.296 --> 03:25:44.599 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OF THE BAR.

03:25:42.931 --> 03:25:47.635 region:rollup2
WERE VERY TROUBLING AND.

03:25:44.599 --> 03:25:48.570 region:rollup2
I'D LOVE ANY PERSPECTIVES ON

03:25:47.635 --> 03:25:49.837 region:rollup2
THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY.

03:25:48.570 --> 03:25:50.838 region:rollup2
SPELL I AM WILLING TO SUPPORT

03:25:49.837 --> 03:25:51.406 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:25:50.838 --> 03:25:53.608 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:25:51.406 --> 03:25:55.310 region:rollup2

WE GET ALL THIS INFORMATION BACK

03:25:56.678 --> 03:25:58.813 region:rollup2

INCREASE.

03:25:58.813 --> 03:26:01.716 region:rollup2

SERIOUSLY. I AM PERSONALLY

03:26:30.178 --> 03:26:32.547 region:rollup2

I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION

03:26:36.684 --> 03:26:39.287 region:rollup2
THREE INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE

03:26:38.086 --> 03:26:40.922 region:rollup2
RECENTLY UNDERTAKEN TO REFLECT

03:26:39.287 --> 03:26:42.624 region:rollup2
OUR COMMITMENT OF THIS AGENDA.

03:26:40.922 --> 03:26:43.591 region:rollup2
ONE AS WE'VE REVISED OUR LEGAL

03:26:42.624 --> 03:26:45.260 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:26:43.591 --> 03:26:46.828 region:rollup2

SECONDLY WE HAVE INITIATED A

03:26:50.164 --> 03:26:54.335 region:rollup2
PROJECT THIS YEAR THAT PROVIDE

RACE GENDER CREED CLASS ETCETERA

03:27:01.809 --> 03:27:05.513 region:rollup2
BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK

03:27:03.745 --> 03:27:07.715 region:rollup2
THAT'S DONE SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE

03:27:05.513 --> 03:27:08.850 region:rollup2
OF COLOR AND WOMEN ON THE OTHERS

03:27:07.715 --> 03:27:10.218 region:rollup2

03:27:19.694 --> 03:27:22.497 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY WE ARE

03:27:20.695 --> 03:27:23.564 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING A CENSUS OF ALL OF

03:27:22.497 --> 03:27:24.966 region:rollup2
THE APPOINTMENTS THAT WE'RE

03:27:24.966 --> 03:27:27.969 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF

03:27:26.367 --> 03:27:29.237 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY AT THIS MOMENT SO THAT

03:27:27.969 --> 03:27:31.072 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT OUR BASE WERE

03:27:29.237 --> 03:27:32.874 region:rollup2
BUILDING FROM AS. SO WE WE GET

03:27:31.072 --> 03:27:34.542 region:rollup2

THESE ISSUES.

03:27:41.649 --> 03:27:43.952 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT JUST

03:27:42.517 --> 03:27:45.153 region:rollup2
OCCURRED TO MY BECAUSE I DON'T

THINK I'VE EVER TAKEN ONE BUT

03:27:45.153 --> 03:27:48.289 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'VE SPOKEN TOO LITERALLY

03:27:47.155 --> 03:27:49.891 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

03:27:48.289 --> 03:27:51.893 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF

03:27:49.891 --> 03:27:53.561 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR WHO JUST

03:27:51.893 --> 03:27:55.930 region:rollup2
DON'T PARTICIPATE IN STATE BAR.

03:27:53.561 --> 03:27:57.298 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES AND DATA JUST CURIOUS

03:27:55.930 --> 03:27:59.500 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S HAPPENED WHEN YOU

03:27:57.298 --> 03:28:01.369 region:rollup2
SAY A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS ON

03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:02.537 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES WOULD BE REFERRING

03:28:01.369 --> 03:28:03.838 region:rollup2
TO EXACTLY WELL I EXCUSE YOU

03:28:02.537 --> 03:28:05.840 region:rollup2

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:09.310 region:rollup2

DIVERSITY. ADVANCING THE ISSUES

03:28:09.310 --> 03:28:13.114 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ATTORNEYS OF

DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.

03:28:13.114 --> 03:28:16.017 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR NO I DON'T HAVE A

03:28:14.916 --> 03:28:17.452 region:rollup2
SENSE OF WHETHER WHAT OUR

03:28:16.017 --> 03:28:19.420 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THINK OTHER THAN AN

03:28:17.452 --> 03:28:20.988 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL FUNDS THAT COMPORTS

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:22.457 region:rollup2

VALUE I THINK THE COULD THE

03:28:26.194 --> 03:28:28.262 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT OF CURRENT LEADERSHIP

03:28:27.195 --> 03:28:29.597 region:rollup2
TO THIS SIDE I JUST I HOPE WE'LL

03:28:28.262 --> 03:28:30.431 region:rollup2
GET TO.

03:28:29.597 --> 03:28:31.499 region:rollup2
SOME REAL RESULTS.

03:28:30.431 --> 03:28:32.433 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS WILL NOT BE A

03:28:31.499 --> 03:28:36.337 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE

03:28:32.433 --> 03:28:38.406 region:rollup2
FORGET ABOUT IN HERE.

03:28:36.337 --> 03:28:40.875 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:28:38.406 --> 03:28:42.310 region:rollup2
JERRY MIKLOS.

THANK YOU SO ON THE DIVERSITY

03:28:42.310 --> 03:28:44.946 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHEN THINGS I AM GONNA

03:28:43.344 --> 03:28:46.748 region:rollup2
PROPOSE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. IS

03:28:44.946 --> 03:28:48.483 region:rollup2
THAT WE HOLD A HEARING ON

03:28:46.748 --> 03:28:49.784 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

03:28:48.483 --> 03:28:51.586 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A BETTER HANDLE

03:28:49.784 --> 03:28:53.121 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT. AND AND IT'S A VERY

03:28:51.586 --> 03:28:54.622 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUE THIS COMMITTEE OR

03:28:53.121 --> 03:28:55.523 region:rollup2
BY ITSELF I WILL SPEAK FOR ME

03:28:54.622 --> 03:28:57.392 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF YOU HAVE BACK THIS

03:28:55.523 --> 03:28:59.927 region:rollup2
IT. HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:28:57.392 --> 03:29:01.696 region:rollup2
THE CUT SCORE IN THE BAR.

03:28:59.927 --> 03:29:03.131 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF THE.

03:29:01.696 --> 03:29:04.298 region:rollup2
OF THE BAR THE BAR EXAM IS TO

03:29:03.131 --> 03:29:05.500 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

03:29:04.298 --> 03:29:07.435 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF ATTORNEYS IN THE

03:29:05.500 --> 03:29:08.770 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I'VE

03:29:07.435 --> 03:29:10.738 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE CUTS

03:29:08.770 --> 03:29:12.907 region:rollup2
CORPS THAT WE USE.

03:29:10.738 --> 03:29:14.675 region:rollup2
IS IS WHAT IS IS REALLY GETTING

03:29:12.907 --> 03:29:17.211 region:rollup2
THAT AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND THE

03:29:14.675 --> 03:29:19.080 region:rollup2
AFFECTED IT TENDS TO HAVE. IS TO

03:29:17.211 --> 03:29:21.215 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HARDER FOR.

03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:22.583 region:rollup2
LAWYERS OF COLOR TO COME INTO

03:29:21.215 --> 03:29:23.184 region:rollup2
THAT THE LAW PRACTICE AND THAT

03:29:22.583 --> 03:29:24.952 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

03:29:23.184 --> 03:29:26.788 region:rollup2
TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY SO IT'S

03:29:24.952 --> 03:29:28.256 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY LOOKING AT.

03:29:26.788 --> 03:29:30.258 region:rollup2
THAT THE SERVICES THE BAR THAT

03:29:28.256 --> 03:29:32.226 region:rollup2
THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAWYERS TO

03:29:30.258 --> 03:29:33.828 region:rollup2
THE BAR BUT IT IS HOW WE ENSURE

03:29:32.226 --> 03:29:35.797 region:rollup2
THAT THE BAR.

03:29:33.828 --> 03:29:37.365 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA

03:29:35.797 --> 03:29:39.400 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS AND LOOKING AT

03:29:37.365 --> 03:29:40.601 region:rollup2
THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE

03:29:39.400 --> 03:29:42.103 region:rollup2
LEGAL PROFESSION IS ONE OF THOSE

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:43.905 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ONES THERE ARE ALSO

03:29:42.103 --> 03:29:45.740 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS. THAT

03:29:43.905 --> 03:29:46.908 region:rollup2
QUALITY ISSUE AND THAT'S ONE OF

03:29:45.740 --> 03:29:48.776 region:rollup2
THE FUNCTIONS THE BARS TO ENSURE

03:29:46.908 --> 03:29:50.111 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROTECTION.

03:29:48.776 --> 03:29:51.712 region:rollup2
HAVING A HIGH QUALITY HIGH

03:29:50.111 --> 03:29:53.548 region:rollup2
STANDARD FOR LAWYERS IN

03:29:51.712 --> 03:29:55.950 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE CUTS

03:29:53.548 --> 03:29:57.485 region:rollup2
SCORE DOESN'T NECESSARILY I IN

03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:58.920 region:rollup2
MY VIEW I DON'T THINK IT IT.

03:29:57.485 --> 03:30:00.188 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT WE HAVE HIGHER

03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:01.589 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF ATTORNEYS THERE ARE

03:30:00.188 --> 03:30:03.124 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN AND

03:30:01.589 --> 03:30:04.292 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT.

03:30:03.124 --> 03:30:06.360 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE HAVE HIGH BARRIERS

03:30:04.292 --> 03:30:07.295 region:rollup2
TO ENTRY.

03:30:06.360 --> 03:30:08.362 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE

03:30:07.295 --> 03:30:10.131 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL

03:30:08.362 --> 03:30:11.165 region:rollup2
PROFESSION IF WE ALLOW.

03:30:10.131 --> 03:30:12.700 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE DIVERSITY LEGAL

03:30:11.165 --> 03:30:14.869 region:rollup2
PROFESSION BUT KEEP THE

03:30:12.700 --> 03:30:16.137 region:rollup2
PROFESSION STRONG THAT SOMETHING

03:30:14.869 --> 03:30:17.605 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO

03:30:16.137 --> 03:30:19.607 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING AT.

03:30:17.605 --> 03:30:21.375 region:rollup2
AND AS TO THE AUDIT.

03:30:19.607 --> 03:30:22.743 region:rollup2
THE WEATHER ZERO BASED BUDGETING

03:30:21.375 --> 03:30:24.912 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS

03:30:22.743 --> 03:30:27.215 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. I DON'T GET TIED UP

03:30:24.912 --> 03:30:27.682 region:rollup2
IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF AUDIT

03:30:27.215 --> 03:30:29.317 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE

03:30:27.682 --> 03:30:30.451 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE.

03:30:29.317 --> 03:30:31.052 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDIES THAT

03:30:30.451 --> 03:30:33.488 region:rollup2
WERE DONE AND THAT'S A FAIR

03:30:31.052 --> 03:30:34.989 region:rollup2
POINT. WE DO NOT WANT THE BAR TO

03:30:33.488 --> 03:30:36.491 region:rollup2
REPLICATE THE STUDIES WE WANT TO

03:30:34.989 --> 03:30:38.559 region:rollup2
USE THE STUDIES WHERE WHERE

03:30:36.491 --> 03:30:40.495 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE IN THAT INFORMATION

03:30:38.559 --> 03:30:41.462 region:rollup2
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO THAT.

03:30:40.495 --> 03:30:43.564 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO NEED THE BUT THE

03:30:41.462 --> 03:30:44.799 region:rollup2
STUDIES ARE. SNAPSHOTS OF

03:30:43.564 --> 03:30:46.200 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CERTAIN TYPES OF

03:30:44.799 --> 03:30:48.102 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WITHIN THE BAR

03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:49.470 region:rollup2
UNIVERSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE

03:30:48.102 --> 03:30:52.140 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH OF A COMPREHENSIVE

03:30:49.470 --> 03:30:53.541 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED. AS

03:30:52.140 --> 03:30:55.209 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED WHERE THE BAR IS

03:30:53.541 --> 03:30:56.444 region:rollup2
GOING TO NEED TO GO FOR I THINK
