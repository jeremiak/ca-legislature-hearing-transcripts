00:13:57.203 --> 00:14:00.639
ECONOMIC. AND LABOR MARKET

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.474
CHANGE DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.510
AUTOMATION IN THE IMPERATIVES

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:05.177
OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IN

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:08.480
MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE- IF

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.050
WE DON'T ADDRESS TODAY'S

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:14.753
INEQUALITIES HOWEVER. WE BAKE

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.655
THOSE SAME INEQUITIES IN OUR

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:17.256
CURRENT LABOR MARKET INTO THE

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:20.559
FUTURE WORK. WE'VE GOT TO THIS

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.928
POINT OF GROSS INCOME

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:23.395
INEQUALITY AND WEALTH

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:24.630
INEQUALITY NOT JUST IN

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.999
CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THIS THE

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.801
COUNTRY BECAUSE GENERATIONS OF

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.803
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.605
A SHARE PROSPERITY- WORKFORCE

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.907
DEVELOPMENT IS NOT GOING TO FIX

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:36.442
EVERYTHING WAS BROKEN IN THE

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:36.976
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.944
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT I THINK

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.512
EVERYBODY SHOULD ATTEND THE

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:42.715
FUTURE WORK. MEETINGS ASSEMBLY

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.717
MEMBER OF COLOR IS ON THAT

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.552
MISSION- AND MADE SOME OF THE

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.587
BEST COMMENTS YESTERDAY AND I

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:49.154
DON'T SEE THAT JUST BECAUSE

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.723
HE'S IN THE ROOM- BECAUSE

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.658
ACTUALLY TRUE AND IS ON FILM SO

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:53.192
YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT FOR

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.495
YOURSELF- I THINK A LOT OF

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:57.096
THIS. WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:14:57.162 --> 00:15:00.666
DONE IS A BIT OUTSIDE OF THE

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:01.300
REALM OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.701
ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IT'S

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.637
ENFORCING LABOR LAW- IT'S CRAZY

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.538
POLICIES AT THE STATE LEVEL AND

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.540
THE LOCAL LEVEL CYNOSURE JOB

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:09.008
QUALITY. OF WORKFORCE

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.010
DEVELOPMENT DOES HAVE A ROLE AT

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:14.480
THE STATE BOARD OUR BIG IDEA IS

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:15.080
THE BILL THE HIGHROAD ECONOMY

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.782
DEFINED BY QUALITY JOBS EQUITY

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.917
JUSTICE IN CLIMATE BILLION SEE

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.886
THIS IS THE GUIDING WORK OF THE

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.721
STATE- IT'S THE PRINCIPLE

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.957
THAT'S THAT'S- BEHIND CREATING

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.859
A NEW FUTURE WORK DEPARTMENT OF

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:28.794
CITY CALIFORNIA THAT'S GONNA

LINE. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:33.432

THE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVELS TO

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.606
GET THAT SCALING IMPACT. I

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:41.106
THINK ALSO THIS IS WHERE

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:42.675
WORKFORCE IN DEVELOPMENT REALLY

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.342
COME TOGETHER THE OVERLAP IN IN

AND VALUE WORKER VOICE- THESE

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.789
COMPANIES TREAT THEIR WORKERS

00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:00.559
NOT AS COSTS BUT IS ASSETS THAT

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.126
THE INVEST IN WE CALL THESE

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:03.062
HIERO COMPANIES. ADDITIONALLY

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.830
WE CREATE ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.899
FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED. GOOD

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.734

EMPLOYMENT DOING EQUITY WORK

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:20.946
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INSURE

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.715
THAT WE'RE BUILDING BRIDGES. TO

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:23.349
COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY OFFER

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:24.917
THE BEST JOBS AND THEN

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:28.454
SUPPORTING THOSE COMPANIES SO

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.088
THERE MOST COMPETITIVE AND THEY

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:29.688
GROW IN THE STATE. AND CREATE

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:26.497
EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.499
TO PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.133

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.607
MOST OF OUR STUDENTS. AND ADULT

LEARNERS ARE NOT ABLE TO GO TO

SCHEDULING AND FLEXIBILITY OF

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:46.551

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:47.151
PARTICULARLY I WOULD WANT TO

00:34:57.395 --> 00:35:00.598
COLLEGES THAT ARE VERY

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:02.600
RESPONSIVE VERY NIMBLE AND GOOD

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:04.569
PARTNERS WITH INDUSTRY AND

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.637
THEY'RE ABLE TO STAND UP OUR

00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:07.171

SHORT TERM TRAINING FOR GOOD

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:14.745
CAREERS. THE CHALLENGE FOR

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:18.416
THESE PROGRAMS ARE THERE NOT

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.050
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FALL ON THE

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:22.420
CREDIT BEARING SIDE THEY'RE NOT

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.889
WELL FUNDED- CONTRACT THAT

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.491
EDUCATION IS AN EXAMPLE AND

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.826
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AND

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.828
INVESTMENT INTO THAT PARTICULAR

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.930
SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. TO DO A

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.699
COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:36.968
SYSTEMS STATEWIDE TO CAPTURE

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:38.736
THE OUTCOMES- BUT A LOT OF

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:42.707
THESE PROGRAMS DO PRODUCE JOB

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:43.341
PLACEMENTS AND THEY PUT PEOPLE

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:44.876
INTO CAREERS AND THEY ARE A

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.811
VERY GOOD AVENUE IN. IN

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:50.648
DEVELOPING LIFELONG LEARNING IN

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:52.617
AN ENTRY INTO EDUCATION THAT

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:56.554
CAN EVENTUALLY LEAD TO CREDIT

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:57.188
BEARING PROGRAMS AND NON CREDIT

00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:00.825
PROGRAMS. AND ANOTHER AREA FOR

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.960
CONSIDERATION IS THE THERE ARE

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.762
JOBS THAT ARE IN HIGH DEMAND

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.864
OUT THERE THAT NOT THEY'RE NOT

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.566
PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON BECAUSE

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.601
OF THE PAY WAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.637
THE HOME ON HEALTH AIDE-

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:14.472
THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND WE ARE

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:15.106
ASKED TO DO A LOT OF TRAINING.

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:18.576
THE CONCERN HAS BEEN AROUND THE

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:21.145
WAGES AND SO DO YOU KNOW HOW DO

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.780
YOU FIND CAREER PATHWAYS INTO

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.515
OTHER HIGHER PAYING WAGES FROM

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.851
THESE KINDS OF JOBS WHICH ARE

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:30.421
IN DEMAND- DIMENSION- ECONOMIC

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.790
DEVELOPMENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.525
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT KEY PART

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.427
THAT I THINK COULD ME COLLEGES

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.863
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON. IT

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:39.363
DOES TWO THINGS A CREE

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.831
INNOVATION IN PROGRAMS IT

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:44.635
CREATES MORE INNOVATION AND A

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.269

COMMUNITY I THINK THE

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.787
IMPORTANCE OF BEING FOR ANY

00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:04.522

BECAUSE OF JUST THE WAY. I

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.652

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.761
AND THEY'VE EVEN STARTED

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:51.261
DEVELOPING A PARTNERSHIP

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.930
PROGRAM FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS-

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.732
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN THE

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.533
STATE AND I SEE THAT IT. THE

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.167
POTENTIAL FOR X. SCALING THAT

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.669
BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THE

00:43:58.736 --> 00:43:59.169

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:00.637
LEGISLATURE- HAVE REAL

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:04.441
POTENTIAL NOT FOR PEOPLE- ONLY

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:04.975
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENT

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.777

LOT OF POTENTIAL THERE. OVER

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:30.768
THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO. CHRIS

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.669
JUST TOOK A QUICK QUESTION. IS

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.872
WHAT PERCENTAGE I DON'T THINK

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:38.709
THIS IS WELL KNOWN PUBLICLY.

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.778

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:56.446
CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH OF THOSE-

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:56.947
OUR INTER PROJECT LABOR

IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:24.881
ALL THE TIME. WHAT WHAT I'VE

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:27.417
SEEN THAT'S BEEN EXTREMELY

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:28.485
HELPFUL IS WHENEVER- MANY OF

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:29.085
THE ORGANIZATION'S PARTICULAR

00:51:29.152 --> 00:51:30.821
WHEN CALIFORNIA COMMUTE

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.722
COLLEGES ARE WRITTEN INTO THE

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.524
BILL TO BE AT THE TABLE TO BE

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:35.125
PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT'S

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.893
ALWAYS BEEN VERY HELPFUL- THAT

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.095
HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE SO

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.797
THAT HAS BEEN. RECENTLY A LOT

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:44.601
OF DIFFERENT BILLS THAT WE'VE

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:45.068
BEEN WRITTEN INTO TO

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:48.605
PARTICIPATE AND IT REALLY HELPS

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:49.172
SORT OF GROW THE ECO SYSTEM

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.874
BECAUSE AND BUILD THOSE

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.776
RELATIONSHIPS I CAN THINK OF

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:56.513
ONE RECENTLY. THAT HELLO HOW

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.682
ARE OVER THAT SHE- CAME CAME

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:00.917
ABOUT BUT AB FIVE SEVEN SEVEN

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:02.519
WHERE- WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:04.521
TEACHERS COMMISSION WORKING

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:05.055
WITH A CALIFORNIA COMMUNE

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.756
COLLEGES TO DEVELOP THOSE.

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.925
ONLINE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.861
AND IT BROUGHT US TO THE TABLE

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:14.531
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A LONG

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:15.031
TRADITION OF PARTNERING

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:20.604
TOGETHER SO THAT WAS VERY. IT

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.906
IN AS A PERFORMER CAN CAUSE

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.841
STUDENT IS GREAT TO SEE THE

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.443
INVOLVEMENT COLLEGES AND

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.678
WORKING. AS WE SEE THAT THE

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:29.279
WORK WAS DOUBLE MORE WORKING

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:30.947
WITH S. I. YOU FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.549
ON THE HOME CARE WORKERS I

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:33.149
THINK. HAS A SPREAD AROUND THE

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:34.618
STATE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.419
COMPLETE KEY ROLE. IN TRAINING

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:36.987
A LOT OF THESE THESE WORKERS

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:40.857
AND PARENTS AS WELL AND- ONE OF

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:41.458
THE THINGS THAT CAME UP IN THE

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.025
COMMISSION HEARING YESTERDAY

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:42.792
BECAUSE- HOME CARE WORK KEEPS

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.728
COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.863
THE UNICORN FIELD AND IT'S A

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.532
TOTALLY UNDERPAID AND- THERE'S

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:49.065
SO MUCH WICKS THAT. OTHER

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.600
ISSUES THAT GO ALONG WITH IT

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.134
AND- ONE OF THE FROM THE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.003
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE YESTERDAY

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.637
THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT WHILE

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:54.137
WE NEED TO HAVE HIGHER

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:56.506
REIMBURSEMENT RATES. UP FOR

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.675
THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK-

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.944
AND BY SUGGEST THAT MY LOOK THE

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.746
MONEY. OVER MANY DECADES AS

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.915
PRIVATE SECTOR'S GOT RID OF

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:05.515
PENSIONS THERE'S A REASON WHY

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.816
THERE'S SO MANY SENIORS AND

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.919
POVERTY. SO I THINK THAT THERE

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:12.422
IS AN APP THERE'S AN ASPECT OF.

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:13.056
OF THESE CORPORATIONS STEPPING

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:16.560
UP THAT HAVE REALLY. PUT BURDEN

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:18.728
ON TO THE PUBLIC OF TAKING CARE

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:19.362
OF OUR SENIORS AND I THINK THAT

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:22.432
THAT HOW YOU CAN. HELP TO FIND.

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:22.899
SOME OF THESE TRAINING

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.801
PROGRAMS. INCREASED WAGES

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.536
INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:32.809
AND SO I THINK. THAT IF THERE

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:33.410
IS AN ECOSYSTEM. FUNDING PIECE

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:38.748
IS BROKEN. HAS BEEN

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:39.349
INTENTIONALLY KIND OF BROKEN

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.684
OVER THE DECADES BUT- I THINK

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:41.217
THAT THE COLLABORATION AND

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:41.818
SHOWING THAT THE MODEL WORKS.

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:42.919
WILL HELP US. BETTER GO AFTER

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:44.854
THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT WHAT

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:45.455
YOU'RE DOING. AND THEN ON THE

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:46.990
LAST COMMENT I HAVE IS ON THE

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.758
PROCUREMENT. I THINK ANY

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.660
PROCUREMENT. OR SUBSIDY

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.294
SOMETIMES CALLED INCENTIVES BUT

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:52.529
THEIR SUBSIDIES. OF SHOULD COME

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:53.163
WITH GOOD JOBS AND THERE SHOULD

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.764
BE A THERE SHOULD BE

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:56.800
ACCOUNTABILITY- AND I HAVE HAD

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:57.434

THAT PULL BRING BACK AGAIN. BUT

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:03.073
I THINK IT'S CRITICAL. THAT

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:04.774
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT USING PUBLIC

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:07.043
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THAT THEY'RE

WERE DOING THEY JUST KNOW HOW

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:43.284
TO RESUME IN A TIME ON. I'M

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:46.654
SORRY I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.990
A- BAD INFLUENCE AS MUCH AS I

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:52.527
WANTED THEM DATING ONE FOR

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.763
THEMSELVES. I MET A GUY NAMED

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.998
JOHN AREA- WHO IS THAT TIME

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:58.533
THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE-

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.902
POLITICAL UNIONS- THIRTY IT

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:04.572
JUST BECAME A FULL TIME AND- HE

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:06.808
WAS EXPRESSING THE ME THEY DO

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.777
HAVE A GREAT COMPONENT. WITH

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.779
THE CURRICULUM WITH YES I

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:16.718
RECOMMEND HE HAD. TO SAY AND

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:26.828
STOP DO THE WORK. SO I COULD

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.830
NOT IDENTIFY. NOT WHAT THE

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:32.600
INDIVIDUALS A RUN INTO BUT HELP

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:33.201
THEM IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WERE

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.969
RUNNING FROM. AND THAT'S WHEN

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.671
WE GOT THE UNRESOLVED IN

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.773
VICARIOUS TRAUMA. SO FOR A LOT

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.875
OF PEOPLE AND- LET ME GIVE A

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.744
SHOUT OUT TO AND- A PRAYER FOR

YESTERDAY- IN SANTA CLARITA.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.150
BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO IS THE

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.052
NEXT PERSON TO WANT TO HURT

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.021
SOMEONE. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.689
IS GIVE THEM AN EMOTIONALLY

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.925
SAFE PLACE. TO TALK ABOUT HOW

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.726
DO YOU DEAL WITH ANGER HOW DO

DEAL WITH LOW SELF ESTEEM. HOW

DO YOU DEAL WITH TRAUMA. AND A

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:06.601
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT- THE

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:08.670
TRAUMA- THERE'S PTSD IN THE

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.572
COMMUNITY. AND LET ME JUST SAY

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:12.707
AS A LIFETIME RESIDENT OF SOUTH

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.576

NOT POLLS IS CONSTANTLY

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.782
REOCCURRING. THAT MAKES IT

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.851
PRESENT. STRESS PRESENT TRAUMA

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.953
THAT STILL IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.855
AND A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.590
HAVE LEARNED HOW TO- WANNA SAY

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.959
SELF MEDICATE WHETHER IT'S BY

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:34.629
USE OF DRUGS WHETHER IT'S BY-

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.631
ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER FORM- THEY

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.700
CHOOSE TO RUN TO. BUT WHAT'S

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:42.504
MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME. IS HOW

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.706
DO I HELP THEM. WITH THE

PROGRAMS I HEAR ABOUT. THE GRAY

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.331

CENTER. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:06.574
THAT THEY SEE AS WELL IS- WE

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.743
DON'T SEE PEOPLE OF OUR COLOR

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.645
