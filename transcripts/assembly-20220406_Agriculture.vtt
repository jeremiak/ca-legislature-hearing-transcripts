00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:14.291
THINGS LIKE SOIL MOISTURE

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.394
MONITORING BUT- THOSE CAN BE

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.795
HELPFUL TO FARMERS AND THEY'VE

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.296
BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED BUT THERE

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:22.667
REALLY ISN'T MUCH DOCUMENTATION.

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:25.269
IN BASIN WIDE- WATER SAVING- HI

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:26.804
I STRONGLY ENDORSE A PROGRAM

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.406

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.541
SOLID DOCUMENTATION OF ACTUAL

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.076
IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OF

ALL KINDS NOT DESCRIPTION OTHER

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:36.280
SPRINKLER DRIP MICRO IN SERVICE

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.249
YOU'RE GAUGING. AND ONE THING TO

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:41.352
CONSIDER IS. REQUIRING A

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.387
STANDARDIZED IRRIGATION SYSTEM

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.889

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:49.093
SEXY DOCUMENT FORMS. STATE THE

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.561
OTHER THING THAT THAT I DIDN'T

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.863
SEE WHICH IS NOT TOO WELL

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.532
UNDERSTOOD IS THAT. IT

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:57.168
CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS TO GET BY

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:59.103
WITH THE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.439
GET BY WITH LESS WATER BUT WE

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.107
WANT TO ACHIEVE THE SAME OR MORE

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.775
PRODUCTION AND THAT REQUIRES A

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.811
MORE. SYSTEMATIC LOOK AT THINGS.

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:09.480
OUT ONE OF THE BEST COMPLIMENTS

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:12.550
OF THAT IS. TO GAUGE IN THAT

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:13.751
