THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. ON AT A TIME WHEN THE UNITED STATES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MOVING IN A LESS POSITIVE DIRECTION.

AND GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF. CHINESE AMERICANS WHO RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA IN THAT RELATIONSHIP AYE IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT HAS ACTUALLY GONE ON FOR WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.

DARLENE CHIU IN IN CHINA SEPARATIST ORGANIZATION I HELPED FOUND IN VERY VERY PROUD OF ALL THE. ACCOMPLISHMENTS IT'S DONE. BY FOSTERING TRADE AND. TRADING LIKE ECONOMIC. RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINA AND I THINK IT SERVES AS A MODEL FOR OTHER CITIES AND OTHER REGIONS TO. TO REALLY. LOOK AT.

WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT STRONG TRADE RELATIONSHIP WE ALSO WANT.

AND OPENING ITS MASSIVE MARKET TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS HIGH INTELLIGENT EQUIPMENT CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCES. APPAREL ACCESSORIES AND CONSUMER GOODS AUTOMOBILES FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND ELECTRONIC SERVICES.

WE WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT LOGISTIC SUPPORT CORRECT GOBIZ TO ASSIST OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS IN THIS UNIQUE OF AT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY ROBUST ACTIVITY NOT ONLY IN THE PAST BUT COMING FORWARD WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. WELCOME. THANK YOU. SURE IS AND MEMBERS OF. THAT COMMITTEE AND TO DISTINGUISH CASTS GOOD MORNING. I'M VERY HONORED TO BE HERE TO A TEA PARTY IN THIS HEARING AND TO TAKE THAT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME. SOMETHING WE HAVE TOWN TOGETHER WITH A GROUP IS IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BEING. PROMOTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT COOPERATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND CHINA. AND IT'S JUST AS SET AB HAS MISSIONS IN A PRO TRIED TO THIRTEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CHINA'S MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND SEVEN. CHINESE PROVINCES SENSITIVE SIGNED THE MOU IN BEIJING TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA OF THE CHINESE PROVINCES AND THE CALIFORNIA TRONG WORKING GROUP ON TRADE AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION. WHICH WAS FOLLOWING THE. CONSENSUS OF PRESIDENCY AND THE GOVERNOR PRONG. AND TO THE GLOBUS TAKES THE LEADERSHIP OF THE TRONG WORKING GROUP ON THESE CALIFORNIA SITE. AND TO HOUSE DONNA LOTS OF CREE WORKS IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND I BELIEVE THIS SETUPS TO TWO SECRETARIES OF THE. CALIFORNIA SIDE OF OUR WORKING GROUP. EACH SHE'S EACH ARE A LOS ANGELES REGIONAL EXPORT COUNSELING FALLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BAY AREA WEANED OFF IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE MAKING OF OUR WORKING GROUP ALL TO REACH TO EDCS IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND OTHER TREAT PROMOTION ALL THOSE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. AND BY DOING THIS IT MEANS THAT OUR. COMPANIES SEND CHINESE INVESTORS COULD EASILY FIND. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS SEEN. THE FRENCH CALLED HISSING CALIFORNIA WHICH A SMALL USER FOR THEM TO FIND INVEST INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES HERE. SO. I THINK I'LL ACCORDING TO OPPOSITE HIS TAKES SINCE THE YEAR OF TWENTY TWELVE. MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CHINESE COMPANIES ESTABLISHED THE YOUR OPERATION YOU SOLVING CALIFORNIA. THROUGH DIRECT DIRECT INVESTMENT SO THAT'S HIS AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED PER YEAR. AND I BELIEVE EVERY COUNTY OF CALIFORNIA COULD ENJOY FROM THIS. ANOTHER GREAT JOB WE HAVE DOWN WITH GO IS IS TO. CALL GUYS MANY PORTANTINO VENTS JUST AS. EVERY HAS MOTIONS WE CAUGHT ICE THE. CHICK CALIFORNIA CHINA BUSINESS SUMMIT IN THE YEAR OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND HE'S HERE WE HAVE FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED. PEOPLE'S DELEGATION FROM CHINA AND TO THE GOVERNMENT WRONG HAS TAKEN THIS EVENT TWO YEARS IN CONSECUTIVE SO. THIS IS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT THE SEARCH. CAN FOR THE CHINESE. BUSINESS SUMMIT. AND TO BE SIGNED SEARCHING TWENTY THIRTEEN WE ALSO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CALL DIES THE CHINA CALIFORNIA TRADE AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION A SEMINAR. AND WHICH WAS JOINED BY MORE THAN. THREE HUNDRED BUSINESSES FROM BOTH SIDES. AND TO ALL CREATED OUT OF HOPE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. AND. ALTHOUGH THE. HAS ME ALTOGETHER SEVEN WORKING GROUP'S RIGHT NOW. SAYS THE OUR WORKING WERE PERCEIVED IT STATUS. BUT SO THEY CALIFORNIA WILL COMPLY OF ISSUE THE NUMBER ONE. IN TERMS OF THE AIRFORCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS WE HAVE MADE. BESIDES WHAT I JUST MENTIONED. THE HIGH POWERED CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN TECH TREAT MISSION TO CHINA. IN THE YEAR OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE EXCHANGES ARE HIGH SPEED BROUGH. AND TO INFRASTRUCTURE. A SEMINAR IN MATCHMAKING EVENTS OF THE CROSS BORDER E. COMMERCE. ARE ALSO VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS ATHELSTAN TO ACHIEVEMENTS. I BELIEVE WE CAN NEVER MAKE HATES WITHOUT THE. TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION FROM GO BASS SO I IN THAT I WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME TO THANK IN PARTICULAR THE YOUR CONTRIBUTION. AND TO LOOKING TO THE FUTURE AT CHINA BE OPPOSED TO THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL IMPORT EXPO AS. MISS SERGEI AND TO AB HAS BOTH MENTIONED. THIS WILL PROVIDE THESE HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL EXPORTERS. WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER WAS KOBUS. AND MAKE MORE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO YOU ENTER AND EXPENSE CHINESE MARKET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN AND. BEFORE YOU. LEAVE LET'S SEE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANELISTS OR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BUT I THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS BECAUSE INFORMATION HAS BEEN SO EXTENSIVE AND A DEEP AND AND IT JUST THE MORE WE LEARN. WE CAN TAKE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND LET THEM KNOW HOW EXCITING THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE. JEFF JUST TO. THE W. DIRECTOR. IF YOU. AS YOU BEEN DOING THESE ARM. CONVENING THE CONFERENCE IS ENORMOUS CERTAIN MATCHMAKING SESSIONS. AND JUST THROUGHOUT YOUR POLLS VOTE FULLY OF WAR WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IT'S BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE. TOOLS TO BRINGING IN THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENT. IN TERMS OF THE EVENTS WE PARTICIPATE I EITHER DEFENSE OR ANY OF THE. YOU KNOW ANY ANY THE PROGRAM SO YOU'RE DOING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY WITH THOSE EVENTS. I THINK. INTER IT IS WHAT WE DO IS WHEN WE PARTICIPATE IN THESE EVENTS WHICH MOST OF THEM TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S ONE HIGH PROFILE ONE THAT TAKES PLACE EVERY YEAR IN WASHINGTON DC. THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHS OUT THERE SOMETIMES THAT WE HAVE TO DEBUNK. WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY DO WITH OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION PARTNERS IN TANDEM TO EXPLAIN WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS. TO DOING BUSINESS HERE AND THEN FROM A GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE WORK GOBIZ SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVE. TALKING ABOUT THE USE OF THE TAX CREDITS THAT WE OFFER THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ASSISTANCE WITH GETTING THROUGH REGULATORY PROCESS CITIES AND. REGISTRATION AND CITING AND PERMITTING IN BUT I CAN I CATCH THEM ALL. THAT THAT WE OFFERED TO HELP FOREIGN BUSINESSES SITUATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EPIC IS VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE. A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY HOW TO GO ABOUT IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S A VERY APPEALING MARKET AND ONCE WE CAN. PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT TECHNICAL ADVICE IT GOES A LONG WAY. WHAT DO YOU? BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN WOULDN'T COMPANIES ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION TO. LOCATE HERE ARE INVEST HERE. WELL WHAT HAS BEEN THE FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT HAVE THEY TOLD YOU WHY HAVE THEY CHOSEN US. A LOT A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW WHEN I MEET WITH FOR INVESTORS THEY SAY THAT THE MARKET HERE IS SO LARGE OBVIOUSLY IT'S SO DIVERSE I THINK. THAT'S ONE OF THE THE STRENGTHS OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'D LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE IN EMPHASIZE AS YOU GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE BETWEEN SEAT OF SERVICES. HIGH TECH SERVICES CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THEN THE WHOLE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE CENTRE PART OF THE STATE. I MEAN I WOULD DARE SAY THAT UP AMONG ALL OF THE FIFTY U. S. STATES THERE IS AND WE HAVE A VERY LARGE ECONOMY. BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIVERSE AND FOR ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF SUPPLY CHAINS AND. THAT THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN COMING HERE BECAUSE IF THEY WERE IF THEY SITUATED ANOTHER STATE. THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE ADVANTAGES BUILT INTO ONE LOCATION AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO ADVERTISE AND SELL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IT'S ONE THING I NOTICED AND. I GUESS I SHOULD'VE REALIZED BY CAN NOTICED TO I I THOUGHT THE CHART IS. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HEART TRADING PARTNERS YOU KNOW MEXICO. RANKS THE TOP BUT THE REST OF THEM OR THE MOST THE MORE THAN ASIAN COUNTRIES WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY VERY INTERESTING. SO THAT THAT WOULD. SERVE PRESUME THAT JET THAT YOU KNOW OUR WEST COAST GEOGRAPHY. PLAYS A MAJOR FACTOR SEPARATE TO. BEING ON THE EAST COAST AND HAVE A MAJOR TRADE WITH EUROPE IS THAT. THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTOR SAY CALIFORNIA VERSUS TEXAS OR. ILLINOIS A OR FLORIDA OR SOME OTHER PLACE I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S BEEN GEOGRAPHY IS PART OF THE REASON IT'S ALSO THE ILLUSTRIOUS CHINESE AMERICAN DIASPORA THAT YOU ALLUDED TO IN YOUR REMARKS. THAT HELP WITH BUSINESS LINKAGES BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND CHINA THAT'S ALSO JUST BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS THAT OUR STATE HAS ARE THE ADVANTAGES THAT PRESENTS. MUSIC BE FOREIGN INVEST IN WERE FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO CALIFORNIA WAIT A MINUTE SAY THAT AGAIN. NATIONALLY ALLOWED. I THINK IT I THINK IT IS THE ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT ARE STATES THAT ARE STATE PROVIDES. IN TERMS OF THE THAT THE DYNAMIC INDUSTRIES THAT ARE HERE ON THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT INWARD INVESTMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE MAIN APPEAL AND. FOR FOREIGN BUSINESSES MORE SO THAN OTHER STATES BUT MAYBE I'M WHY WE'RE REPEATING THESE BIG REMARKS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HEAR. OUTSIDE WHEN WE GO TO A LOCAL BUSINESS GROUPS AND THINGS JUST HOW. DIFFICULT CALIFORNIA CAN BE AND SO WHEN WE CARE POSITIVE COMPLIMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE SAY THEM. THANK YOU. CAN EIGHT PROVIDE ONE MORE YES LORD FIT. SAID DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY. FLY SWEETLY HAPPY LOSSES PER WEEK TO THE MAJOR CITIES CHINA WE HAVE NINETY TWO FLIGHTS PER WEEK. NINETY TWO. SO. THAT'S MEANS YOU CAN CHOOSE YOU DO WE HAVE THREE FRIES PRETTY TO BEIJING AND TO TO SHANHAI ONE TWO ONE CHAU AND OTHER MAJOR CITIES LIKE TONE CHING'S. CHUNG DO LIKE SHE NINETEEN DAHLE CHANGSHA. SO I THINK. THIS THE CALIFORNIA IS JUST A SO CLOSE TO CONNECTED TO BE CHINA TO THIS MIGHT BE THE MAJOR REASON WHY CHINESE INVESTORS. PREFER TO REVISING CALIFORNIA SO ALREADY VERY COMMITTEE ALREADY CONNECTED. SOMEONE NUMBER TO HER AND I JUST WANNA CHARMING TO. FILL FOR A QUESTION. AND I WILL SAY THAT. CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SILICON VALLEY AND NO NOBODY KNOW WHERE CAN DUPLICATE THE SILICON VALLEY THING INNOVATION. A A AT AT THE CENTER OF THE HERBS SO SILICON VALLEY WHERE I AM RIGHT.

WE HAD PARTNERED WITH THAT THEN AMBASSADOR GARY LAUCK IN BEIJING TO CLOSE THAT INVEST IN US REAL ESTATE SUMMIT AND WHICH RESULTED IN TO. I THINK. INVEST INVESTORS COMING TO SERVICES GOAT OF SIGNIFICANCE ONE WAS OCEAN Y.. AS A COUNCIL REN HAD MENTIONED. THEY HAVE REQUIRED A PROJECT THAT WILL BE. PROBABLY ONE OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS THERE'S FROM CHINA AND WE HAD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS IN SAN FRANCISCO. A WE ALSO IS FOUNDED A. INITIATIVE BECAUSE CHINA SOUTH BILLS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE SINCE. BROUGHT TWO DELEGATIONS TO CHINA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THAT RESULTED IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED LEAD SINCE THEN AND WILL BE HOSTING ANOTHER ONE AGAIN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS YEAR. CHINA SURF WE ALSO CREATED A SANDBOX MANY TO FOCUS ON TECH BUT BASICALLY TO CONNECT TECH COMPANIES FROM CHINA INTERESTED IN THE ECOSYSTEM THAT IS SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.

TO CONNECT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. TO THE GREATER BAY OF THE PRO RIVER DELTA THE AREA. I THINK THAT CONCLUDES MY GREAT JOB UP ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO ASK REALLY QUICKLY BEFORE WE GO IS. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WHAT ABOUT DOLE IMMERSION PROGRAMS. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA OF HELL I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WITH CHINESE AND ENGLISH. BUT I KNOW THE FEW BUT ARE THERE MANY OR DO YOU TRACK ANY OF THAT FOR. I HONESTLY DO NOT PERSONALLY TRACK BUT I DO KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. MANY. YEAH CHINESE IMMERSION PROGRAMS AYE EVEN AT LEAST TWO OR THREE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW ARE. IMMERSION WITH CHINA AND CHINESE. AND ALSO THERE ARE MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS NOW THAT ARE PROVIDING CHINESE IMMERSION PROGRAM SO YES THAT IS DEFINITELY AT LEAST AN UPTICK IN THAT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LOOKED THE SECOND I CUTS WERE QUICK QUESTION IF FARMS ACTION MIGHT MY TWO DOLLARS ARE THE. IMMERSION PROGRAM AND. IN SAN FRANCISCO. SUCH EACH SO ONE THING I THINK YOU DIDN'T MENTION WAS HOW MANY OTHER CITIES AND REGIONS HAVE ALSO STARTED TERM. DO THE SAME MODEL AS CHINA STAFF COULD YOU. TALK ABOUT A MINUTE TO ABOUT THAT. ON WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON. IN THE STATE THAT I KNOW THROUGH RIGHT THE STATE'S AND I AM I KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. ANTONIO YOUNG WHO HEADS UP THE TRADE OFFICE AND IS BASED IN CHALLENGING MOST OF THE TIME WE ACTUALLY WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY. AND AND AND. ONCE IN AWHILE WE ACTUALLY ALSO WORKED WITH HIM ANA BELIEVE IT OR NOT. AND THEN LA IS ACTUALLY VERY. YOU KNOW THEY'RE KIND OF SELF CONTAINED ALREADY BUT WE ARE OPEN TO COOPERATE ACTUALLY STATEWIDE OF LIFE WORK WAS SENT PORTANTINO FOR EXAMPLE. THEY DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE THERE PER SE BUT THE THING IS THAT WHEN THEY CALL US WE DO TRY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE THERE. YES. THANK YOU WELCOME LESTER KELLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. HOLDING THIS HEARING FOR A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I'M VERY GLAD DE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE. WORK KELLY WAS ACTUALLY FOUNDED BY CHINESE. IT WAS IT WAS STARTED BY A AMERICAN COMPANY. THAT NEEDED WORKERS TO BUILD THE CITY AND CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO AND BROUGHT A LOT CHINESE WORKERS AND SO THERE'S A. VERY LARGE A CHINESE INFLUENCE IN MEXICALI MOSTLY FROM CANTON. AND SO WHILE WE'RE TAUGHT A VERY EARLY AGE IN THAT AREA. EAT WITH CHOPSTICKS AND THE. CHINESE FOOD THERE IS VERY WELL KNOWN I THINK. MEXICALI ALONE THERE'S OVER A FOUR HUNDRED CHINESE RESTAURANTS. AND SO IT WAS VERY NATURAL FOR ME AS I START ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO REACH OUT TO CHINESE COMPANIES. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT VERY QUICKLY BUT OF FIRST OF ALL. MY A PARTICIPATION IN TWO ORGANIZATIONS ONE I CALIFORNIA LOOK ASSOCIATIONAL LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND TEAM CALIFORNIA WHICH I WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD. PARTICIPATION IN TRAINING FOR. INTERNATIONAL. EXPORTS AND ALSO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND I'M AFTER I ARE. NOT FINISHED MY TERM AS PRESIDENT TEAM CALIFORNIA I BECAME A VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE INVESTMENT. AND SO MAKING SURE I CONTINUE PARTICIPATING THAT CURRENTLY ARE JUST ELECTED TO THE SAN DIEGO APPEALED TO. DISTRICT EXPORT COUNCIL. AND SO IT'S ARE IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT OUR AYE MEETINGS AND BY THE WAY WE WERE SELECTED AS THE DECK OF THE YEAR FOR THE UNITED STATES TWO YEARS AGO. BECAUSE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE HAVE THEM REGULATE UP AT OUR MEETINGS. V. I. THESE DESIGNER APPAREL COUNTY DISTRICT EXPORT COUNCIL IS REALLY DESIGNED TO. AYE INFLUENCE AND THE. THE INCREASE OF EXPORTS FROM OUR REGION BUT TO WE HAVE ALSO HAD A LINE ITEM ON OUR AGENDA FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. AND PART OF OUR STRATEGY IS BRING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM COMPANIES WANTED OPEN BUSINESSES IN THE U. S. AND RE EXPORT THOSE PRODUCTS AND SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE'VE SEEN NOW WORKING. ONE OF THINGS THAT WE ARE FOUND TRAVELING ABROAD IN BY THE WEB THEN THE CHINA ABOUT TWENTY OVER TWENTY TIMES. VISIT ABOUT THIRTY CITIES. AND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO WE WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED VIRTUAL SHELTER. I WERE SMALL ORGANIZATION WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING. BUT WHAT WE DO IS WE WE REFER PEOPLE TO FEEL CONNECTED CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. AND SO A LOT OF OUR WORK AND HEAD START OFF WITH THE EP FIVE PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE INVESTMENT FOR FOR NEW COMPANIES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. I GOING THROUGH THE RECESSION AND WE FOUND THAT HE BE FIVE WAS VERY GOOD PROGRAM. IT SPECIALLY AS THE ECONOMY IN CHINA WAS INCREASING. AND WE'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL ATTRACTING OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT INTO IMPERIAL VALLEY WHICH IS THAT THE TIME WAS VERY WERE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN TO CHINA. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS KIND OF SHIFT. IN THE IMPORTANCE OF AB FIVE IN AND OUR MARKETING STRATEGY WAS. WE HAVE IT BE FIVE IT. INVESTMENT WHICH COULD OFFER VIS'S. BUT WE ALSO FOR TRADES. TODAY WE'RE MARKETING SPECIFICALLY THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES ó AND BY THE WAY WE ALSO HAVE THE BE FIVE PROGRAM. AND SO WE ST SEEN THAT SHIFT IN THAT'S REALLY BASED UPON. WHAT THE INTEREST IS BY OUR CHINESE CLIENTS LEASES ARE STILL VERY IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S A DIRECTION IN CHINA? TO PARTICIPATE AT THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONE LEVEL. AND THAT'S GOING ON AND COME BACK TO THAT LATER AND TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS. IF I WANT TO MENTION THAT. LAST YEAR WE I'M HAD REPRESENTING THIS COMMITTEE TRAVIS ALLEN WHO I WANT TO. FUZHOU WITH US AND THE SPECIFICALLY TO TALK ABOUT THIS ITEM. TO TALK ABOUT THE VIRTUAL SHELTER PROGRAM AND TO ALSO SPECIFICALLY MARKET TO OF FOREIGN TRADE ZONES. AND THE A FOREIGN TRADE SOME PILOT PROGRAM A THAT'S IN THAT PROVINCE AYE WE'VE HAD DELEGATIONS ATANAS MATTER FACT I JUST CAME FROM A DINNER LAST NIGHT WE HAVE DELEGATION IN THEM PEARL COUNTY. RIGHT NOW. AND. WE AND THEY DID A TOUR OF THE IMPERIAL COUNTY. I'D TO AND LOOK AT SOME SITES I TO BUILD MANUFACTURING PLANTS IN TODAY ARE VISITING WITH THAT IN MEXICO IN MEXICO WITH CHINESE OUR CLIENTS ALSO. AND THEY WILL BE A SPEND SOMETIME THE PRO COUNTY. THOSE DELEGATIONS ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S DELEGATION. THAT. GAME THEIR INTEREST BECAUSE THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONE AND THE FREE TRADE ZONE RELATIONSHIP SO WE DEVELOPED WITH CHINA. AND SO WE FEEL THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT IS WORKING. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT STRATEGY WE DO NEED HELP FROM THE STATE. AND THIS THE HELP THAT WE NEED FROM STATE IS REALLY STAKE STRENGTHENING THAT LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO FOREIGN TRADE ZONES. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR TRADES ON THE REGULAR BAY REGULATED BY A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE. AND SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING FROM FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT'S DIFFERENT STRENGTHENS OUR LANGUAGE THAT REALLY DOES SUPPORT. VIA FOREIGN TRADE ZONES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IN CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THE THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES OF THE FREE TRADE ZONES ARE REALLY ADMINISTERED. AND. THERE ARE THIRTY COMES FROM THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL SO THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. SUPPORT THAT. I SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH. TO GO VISIT ALSO WITH WITH THEM TONY SIMON'S FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND HAVE HAD VERY VERY POSITIVE A RESPONSE FROM THEM RIGHT NOT SOMETHING WILL BE WORKING ON TOGETHER. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AS I MENTIONED TRAVIS ALLEN. OF THE THE VICE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE TRAVEL TO WORK WITH THIS LAST LAST WEEK OR LAST YEAR TO CHINA. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PUBLIC OFFICIALS TRAVEL TO CHINA. I THINK I'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINA BUT YOU CAN ONLY TAKE IT SO FAR AS A PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBER. AND IN IN ORDER TO SHOW THE IMPORTANCE IN THE RESPECT. OF OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BETTER. ONE THING THAT WERE VERY CAUTIOUS OF IS MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT VIOLATE THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES. AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A STRATEGY AND A PROCESS THAT'S UNDERSTOOD BY ALL INVOLVED. NOT ONLY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO THAT THERE'S NOT MISREPRESENTATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS OF THIS PROCESS CONTINUES. AND THAT CONTINUES AND IS IS GOOD FOR ALL INVOLVED. AS I MENTIONED THE PARTICIPATION IN AND OUT TRADE CONFERENCES. WILL BE PARTICIPATING AGAIN THIS YEAR WITH GOBIZ AND WASHING DC IT'S LIKE USA. AND THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SELECT USA AT EXCUSE ME WITHOUT GO BECAUSE. ON HAVING A LOCAL EVENTS IN THE BILL COUNTING AND SO LOCAL EVENTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE PROVINCIAL. I'M CONSULATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. AND PROVIDING FOUND TOURS I EXPLAIN TO THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BILL COUNTY AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S VERY LARGE STATE VERY DIVERSE STATE. AND SO NOT ONLY IN CHINA DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE FIFTY STATES BUT ALSO WITH THEN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE DIVERSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT? THAT WE I'M BRING PEOPLE TO OUR REGION'S LET THEM KNOW WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE SO THEY CAN SHARE THAT. AND IMPERIAL COUNTY AS WERE. AND EXPORTING QUITE A BIT OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS TO ASIA WE'RE SEEING A GROWING MARKET IN CHINA. NOT ONLY FOR FORAGE CROPS BUT ALSO FROM OUR BEEF PRODUCTS AND FROM OUR OUR CITRUS CROPS. OF ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US IN THEM IN THEM CALIFORNIA IS OUR PORTS. AND THE COST OF TRANSPORTING GOODS TO ASIA ESPECIALLY CHINA IS VERY VERY LOW. I WE DID A STUDY AND IT COST US LESS TO EXPORT. A OUR CONTAINER OF ALFALFA TO CHINA. THEN IT DOES GO SHIPPING CONTAINER TO FRANCE. AND SO THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THAT DISPARITY. AND THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT DOES CREATE TO. THE REAL GOOD OPTING FOR FOR US IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WE TO WE ON. WORK WITH OUR PORTS AND TO TAKE INCREASE THE EXPORT SIDE OF REPORTS. SOMETHING ELSE AGO THIS HAS A I'M REALLY DONE A GOOD JOB WITH HIS THE. TARGET OF EMPLOYMENT AREAS WHICH ASSIST WITH THE EP FIVE PROGRAM. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THAT PROGRAM WAS. SENT TO. GO BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT IT CREATED A DEFICIENCY. AND I'M SORRY ASSISTED AND HELPING. TO DEVELOP THE LANGUAGE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. ANY TIME THAT THERE IS ANY BE FIVE INVESTMENT THAN THE HOUSE BE A LETTER SHOWING THAT THAT THERE'S A TARGET AND EMPLOYMENT AREA. AND THOSE LETTERS ARE TURNED AROUND I'M IN ABOUT A DAY OR TWO FROM GO THERE SO THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL. IN HELPING US TO ATTRACTED THE FIVE INVEST ROCK COUNTY. OUR ENTIRE COUNTY QUALIFIES NOT ONLY PRETTY B. FIVE FOR FOR FOREIGN TRADE ZONES. AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HELP EXPLAIN WHY HE LOVES YOU FIVE YEAH. SO IF YOU FIND INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS A A PROGRAM THAT. ALLOWS FOREIGN INVESTORS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN TO PRY INTO REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IT IN TWO WAYS ONE IS EITHER AND AB FIVE DESIGNATED AREA OR TARGET EMPLOYMENT AREA. I DIDN'T THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT ISMILLION DOLLARS EXCEPT FOR TWO DAYS WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND IT'S BEEN VERY CSUS SEX SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR US AS I MENTION. IT ALLOWS THOSE ARE MAKING INVESTMENT TO APPLY FOR. A PERMANENT DONE. LEASES AND POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE APPLY FOR A CITIZENSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES SO IT'S A PATHWAY. TO CITIZENSHIP. AS I MENTIONED WHEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN HELPING US TO TARGET INVESTMENT. AND INTO THE IMPERIAL COUNTY BUT I WANTED I WANT TO ADD ONE THING TO THAT. WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH THIS PROGRAM. BUT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS REINVESTMENT BY THOSE INVESTORS. AND SO AFTER FIVE YEARS THE INVESTOR CAN. AND IS EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THEIR INVESTMENT BACK THEY HAVE TO PUT THAT MANY A RISK FOR FIVE YEARS. SO AFTER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS MANY THOSE INVESTORS REINVENT RECEIVING THEIR MONEY BACK AND REINVESTING THAT PROGRAM. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS VIRTUAL SHELTER PROGRAM. COMES IN PLACE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS DOING SEMINARS. TO. COMPANIES OR INVESTORS THAT ARE WRITTEN OR READY TO REINVEST THEIR MONEY AND SHOWING THAT THERE'S LOCATIONS OF THE CAN REINVEST. IN THE INVEST WITH WHEN THEY MAKE THE RICH ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. THEY ARE ARE RELYING ON THE EP FIVE. CENTER REGIONAL CENTER TO HANDLE A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THEIR VISAS THE TAXES IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT WHEN THEY REINVEST. THEIR UNFAMILIAR WITH HOW TO SET UP A CORPORATION HOW TO. I WHAT THE TAX IMPLICATE IMPLICA IMPLICATIONS COULD BE SITE SELECTION THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WE CAN HELP THEM DO THAT. SO THAT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THEY WERE DOING WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO TALLA CHINA FOUR TIMES PER YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THAT I WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO CHINA TO GIVE THE SEMINARS WERE DOING THROUGHOUT A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL. IT FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNSHIPS AYE WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM FOR INTERNSHIPS WE'VE HAD INTERNS. FROM A CHINESE ATTENDING U. S. SCHOOLS FROM UNIVERSES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IRVINE PEPPER NINE. AND THE. A MICHIGAN STATE AND THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL FOR US AND BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPANIES AND CHINA. BUT ALSO WE'VE CONTINUED THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AFTER THOSE STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURRENTLY HAVING A NEW INTERN THAT IS ATTENDING SCHOOL IN XI'AN CHINA. AND SEWER BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND SHE IN XI'AN. AND SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND IS THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION TO THE CHINESE. I'M POPULATION AND I IT'S A GREAT AVENUE FOR US TO SEEK INVESTMENT. AND SO ONE OF AND AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE IS REALLY TRY TO BUILD ON THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT. WE BUILT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX CAMPUS IN THEM PEARL COUNTY THAT WAS FINANCED. I'M BY INVESTORS FROM CHINA AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO AND. I BRING INVESTMENT AND ALSO CONTINUE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON. I'M WITH OUR ORGANIZATION BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE COUPLE A. HOW COMPLIMENTS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND AND THE SUPPORT FROM GOBIZ FOR US HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL? AND W. ONCE WE WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. WE DO HAVE OFFICE IN. DOLLY ON A CHINA I'LL BE VISITING THERE IN TWO WEEKS. AND WILL BE THE FIRST TIME I'VE VISITED OFFICE I'VE BEEN A DOLLAR ON THREE TIMES BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A. BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION AND CHINA IS VERY IMPORTANT THERE SEVERAL CITIES AND REGIONS THAT HAVE. OFFICES THROUGHOUT CHINA AND HELPS US CONTINUE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WE JUST OPENED FOR TRADES ON OFFICE IN THEM PEARL COUNTY. AND THE DELEGATION IS VISITING THIS WEEK FROM CHINA CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE FOREIGN TRADE ZONE OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRAVIS ALLEN. NOT ONLY VISITED AS YOU MENTION THAT REALLY ENJOYED THAT AND. ON WHICH SHE WAS HERE SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT BUT SUMMER. DO JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MISTER CALDERON POLITICS AFTER I HAVE TO RUN TO MY NEXT MEETING. BUT HE GET A GIVEN YOUR PROXIMITY MEXICO I'M SURE THAT THAT HISTORICALLY WAS A FOCUS OF TRADE AND COMMERCE. HOW HARD WAS IT TO? GET THE REGION TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THAT. PROXIMITY IN DESTRUCTIV FOCUS ON CHINA AND OTHER OTHER PLACES. WELL I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I I THINK I AM WHEN I STARTED COMING DEVELOPMENT IT WAS IT WAS. START OFF BEING. CITY TO CITY AND IN FIGHTING THOSE THOSE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL BATTLES IN IN SO WE HAD TO UNIFY. AS A. AS A REGION IN THE SECOND OF ALL I WE DEVELOPED A COMMITTEE WORKING COMMITTEE WITH MEXICO IN MEXICO ITS INTERNAL. MEXICALI BUSINESS ALLIANCE WE NEED ON EVERY TWO MONTHS AND THEN WE EXPANDED THAT PROGRAM WITH THE CALICO. THE I. KELLY BOB BY NATIONAL MEGA REGIONS WE WORKED WITH SAN DIEGO AND THE FIVE MUNICIPALITIES MBAH WE MEET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. AND IT'S REALLY TO EXPAND OUR EXPOSURE. IN MARKETING AS A AS A MUCH LARGER REGION. AND SO BILL COUNTIES A VERY SMALL COUNTY POPULATION SO HAVING THOSE PARTNERS IS VERY HELPFUL. pBUSINESS WITH MEXICO AND I THINK BECAUSE OF OUR AGRICULTURE EXPORTS. IT'S BEEN HELPFUL BUT IT HAD IT WAS DIFFICULT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT A BEGINNING AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A A LOT OF UP. A CHALLENGES THAT I HAD I'M JUSTIFYING MY. MY I TRAVEL ABROAD IN TRYING DEVELOP THIS RELATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS UNTIL PEOPLE CAME TO THE GROUND BREAKING IS IN SIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. AND SO WE STUCK WITH IT AND I WILL I JUST WANT TO I'M MAKE A POINT. IT'S THE IT'S THE CONSISTENCY THAT NEEDS TO BE SHOWN TO CONTINUE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. AND SO I'M I'VE BEEN WORKING A SPECIFICALLY CHINA FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS. AND I BILL SO GREAT RELATIONSHIPS BUT I WE WE NEED TO CAN KEEP THAT CONSISTENCY AND SALSA CONSISTENCY. FROM THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE UNDEAD THESE PROGRAMS IN CHINA. AND I THINK THAT'S A FABULOUS POINT I'M SURE YOUR FIRST THREE FOUR YEARS WERE VERY TOUGH BUT NOW I'M. I'M SURE YOU'RE BEARING THE FRUITS OF ALL THAT ALL THAT WORK I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THAT CONSISTENCY IN THAT DECK COMMITMENT LONG TERM COMMITMENT IS REALLY. ABSOLUTE CRITICAL. THANK YOU. SOMEONE NUMBER. ALRIGHT WE NEXT HAVE WELL BEFORE I DO THAT WHY NO WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST THAT WALK DAN AND I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH HER FOR A FEW YEARS REPUBLICAN FORMER REPUBLICAN LEADER CONNIE CONWAY. THERE SHE IS. LIKE TO WELCOME YOU AND YOUR GUESTS THANK YOU FOR COMING. WELCOME EVERYBODY. ALRIGHT SO NEXT WE HAVE ON OUR PANELISTS WE HAVE PETER. SHALLOW WHO IS FROM A GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT CHINA WEEK I HEARD FROM OUR DEPUTY AND I KNOW I ATTENDED ANY OF THAT. OF THE YEAR OF THE DOG AND THOSE TYPE OF EVENTS ARE NOT ONLY VERY. EXCITING AND FUN BUT I EVEN HAD THEM TO MY NAME AND SOME OF THE RECOVERY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU AS PART OF CHINA WEEK THIS YEAR. ELKAY BEFORE SOME REMEMBER TING GOES OUT I WANT TO. THANK HIM FOR SPEAKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF CHINESE AMERICANS AS A PIVOTAL UNIQUE ASSET. IN CALIFORNIA. A THAT COULD REALLY FACILITATE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT. BUT WORTHWHILE PROCESS WITH THE INHERENT KNOWLEDGE CULTURAL TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES AND I THINK THIS IS ONE ASSET THAT WE HAVE CALIFORNIA HAVE THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS. AND REALLY. A IT IS TRANSFORMATIONAL SO AS A CALIFORNIAN. OF CHINESE DESCENT. I ALSO. WANTED TO ADDRESS THE COUNCIL GENERAL. AND. THE COMMERCIAL COUNSEL FROM LOS ANGELES BECAUSE MY. GRANDFATHER'S ANCESTRAL HOME OF SUN DOME HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT SO WE HAVE THREE ARE. SANDEL KNEES REPRESENTED AND I THINK IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THIS INHERENT UNIQUE HUMAN CONNECTION WE HAVE. HOPE I KNOW THE TOPIC TODAY'S ABOUT TRADE. AND COMMERCE IN JOBS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. MANY AGREE THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP TODAY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. NOW THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT IS HEAVILY POLITICIZED. AND DRAMATIC AND COMPLICATED AND NUANCED AND I THINK WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY OUT A WIN WIN. TO THIS CONVERSATION THAT IS REALLY GROUNDED IN OBS IN THE SHARED PROSPERITY INNOVATION. AND. A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT I THINK THOSE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR REALLY A BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THIS RELATIONSHIP SO FOR THAT REASON MADAM. CHAIRMAN. NO ONE APPLAUD YOU FOR THE LEADERSHIP IF YOU OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S THAT IMPORTANT. IT IT REALLY ADDS A HUMAN COMPONENT. TO THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE REALLY THE BIG STAKES THAT WE FACE ARM LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF MY ACTIVITIES OVER CHINA WEEK. CHINA WEEK IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WAS LAUNCHED THREE YEARS AGO. AND IN THE PAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BECOME. THE LARGEST. BIND VOLUME OF CONTENT IN A CONCENTRATED TIME THE LARGEST OPERATOR CHINESE THINGS PROGRAMMING. FOR THE AMERICAN MAINSTREAM SO THANKS TO PARTNERSHIPS WITH MEDIA OUTLETS LIKE THE LA TIMES THE LA BUSINESS JOURNAL ON THE NUMBER OF MEDIA. ORGANIZATIONS WE FOR. WE'VE HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING. A MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS IN MEDIA ASSETS TO SHARE AND COMMUNICATE AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. WITH THE THINGS THAT NOW ONE OF OUR MY KEY PROGRAMS ARE PARTNERS ARE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. OF ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS SOME OF THE LARGEST US. MUSEUMS IN IN CALIFORNIA. THE ONE OF ARE START PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA CHINA SUMMIT WHICH WE. ARE ARE THE PRIMARY. COMMUNITY BASED OPERATOR IN CONCERT WITH A THE FOLKS AGO BIZ. AND THE CHINESE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM. SO WE'RE. ENTERING OUR THIRTY YEAR. AND. FIRST YEAR WE'VE HAD ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ATTENDEES. IT'S PAST JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. CLOSE TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND WERE ABOUT TO SEE WERE JUST ABOUT TO BIRTH THE NEXT. CALIFORNIA CHINA SUMMIT AND I KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES HERE. DARLENE I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO REPRESENT. A SAN FRANCISCO THIS YEAR'S CALIFORNIA CHINA SUMMIT BECAUSE OUR MANDATE IS TO. IS TO BE. STATEWIDE. SO I THINK THESE ARE SOME OF THE ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS DON'T TO MEANINGFULLY BRINGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF CALIFORNIA TO THE TABLE. AND WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH GOBIZ. AND THE CHINESE CONSULATE TO REALLY IDENTIFY THE RESPECTIVE SWEET SPOTS AND I THINK THIS IS A PROGRAM WORTH. REPLICATING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. A WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE I THINK. FD I IS ONE OF THE BIG THEMES THAT WE'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU TRACKED. VIS VIS INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF OF CHINA IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD SAY A LARGE A PLURALITY OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN REALLY BEEN BUYOUTS. THEY'VE BEEN CORPORATE BUYOUTS THEY'VE BEEN EMANATE TRANSACTIONS. INASMUCH AS THEY DO ENJOY NEW CAPITAL INTO THE MARKETPLACE. THEY'RE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO JOB CREATION WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES. AND. WE SEE MANY CHALLENGES IN REALLY THE FULL ENGAGEMENT. OF THIS RELATIONSHIP. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WE STARTED TO LOOK AT IS HOW DO YOU MAKE VIABLE AYE WE ASK THE QUESTION. A. I WAS ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO WE. ENGAGE HOW DO HOW DO WE BRING MORE PLAYERS TO THE TABLE AND I THINK. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE STARTING AT A AT AN AMAZING PLACE. I CAN TELL THE STREET ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHINA TRADE. A DEMO YOU THAT WAS INITIATED BY OUR OWN GOVERNOR AND THE CHINESE PRESIDENT. ITSELF INDICATING SOLVE BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY CHINESE BUSINESS THIS REALLY CREATES THE CALIFORNIA CHINA RELATIONSHIP. AT A LEVEL THAT IS UNPARALLELED BY ANY OTHER. REGION. SO WOULD THIS CALIFORNIA CHINA MOW YOU COUPLED WITH OTHERS HAVE LAID. A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT GROUNDWORK WHERE AND IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY REFRESHING TO SEE OUR CALIFORNIA LIKE DID. HA HA I. ARE CALIFORNIAN GOVERNMENTAL LEADERS AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENTAL LEADERS SHARING ONE DYESS AND HAVING THIS. OF ROBUST OF A RELATIONSHIP I THINK THEY'VE REALLY. DONE AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB IN LAYING A FRIENDSHIP IN A CONTEXT IN THE FOUNDATION SO. AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. WANTED THE INITIATIVES THAT I'VE NOW GONNA PUT ALL MY OTHER HAT AS A AS AN ENTREPRENEUR. AS A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR IN THE CALIFORNIA CHINA SPACE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN LAUNCHING CLOSE TO NINE BUSINESSES. AND. THE LATEST ENDEAVOR AND THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS REALLY A SHARE ITS. WHICH IS CAN WE ENGAGE A SUBSTANTIAL CHINESE EQUITY UNDER THE MANAGEMENT UNDER THE JOINT MANAGEMENT OF A CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT TEAM. AND WITH CHINESE MANAGEMENT TEAM OF PUT. AND CAN WE REALLY A LOOK AT. BUT THE FRAMEWORK OF THE VERY SAME ALL USE CREATED AND INVEST IN ACCORDANCE. WHAT THESE THINGS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT? FOR TO REALLY ENGAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND TO REALLY FIND. THE. BUSINESSES THAT ARE READY TO GO YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO ON A HUNT YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO ON A VERY EXTENSIVE. FISHING EXPEDITION YOU HAVE TO TALK TO A LOTTA BUSINESSES AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS DEALS DON'T CLOSE. IS BECAUSE OUR INVESTORS WILL COME. THEY'LL STAY A WEEK AND THEN THEY LEAVE BUT THAT'S WHERE THE. THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START A BUSINESS CONVERSATION IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO CLOSE OF BUSINESS CONVERSATION SO. WE ARE MIDWAY THROUGH. IN. WE'VE. JUST TWO MONTHS AGO HAVE EXECUTED A DEMO YOU WOULD WANT TO CHINA'S BIGGEST INVESTORS AND BIGGEST COMPANIES CHINA PETROL. IN CREATING A UP TO TEN BILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT FUND. A THAT. WE'LL PICK PROCURE THE ENTIRE STATE ACROSS INDUSTRIES. AND WORK WITH ALL THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS. TO IDENTIFY. AND TO LEVERAGE THE BEST RESEARCH CAPABILITIES TO IDENTIFY THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT. DESERVE THE SUPPORT. WILL HELP THEM EXPAND THEIR REGIONAL FOOTPRINT. AS WELL AS HELPING LAUNCH THEM INTO CHINA FOR INSTANCE ONE OF OUR FIRST PARTNERS. OR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES IS A COMPANY CALLED NEW LIGHT TECHNOLOGIES. THIS IS A HOME GROWN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT FIGURED OUT A WAY TO TAKE METHANE GAS. AND CONVERTED INTO BIODEGRADABLE INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIAL GRADE PLASTIC AT BELOW MARKET THAT AB AMONG LOW MARKET COST. SO YOU THINK ABOUT. AND I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED OTHER COMPANIES LIKE THIS THAT WILL MAKE A HUGE DENT. AND THEIR CHINA COVERAGE RIGHT NOW ZERO. SO. WELL IF THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND THE GOVERNMENT FRAMEWORK AND THE VERY SYMBOL USE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITIES AND. WE HOPE THAT IN THE YEAR IN THE DAYS TO COME IN THE YEARS TO COME. WE CAN BE IT A VERY GOOD CONSTITUENT IN BRINGING THESE VARIOUS PARTIES TOGETHER. NOW CAN I CAN I ASK YOU DO YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND LETTING US KNOW WHAT ON THE INVESTMENT FUND AS FAR AS WHAT. I'M TYPING DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS OUR FUND IS ALEC ARE. ALLOCATION RIGHT NOW IS FIVE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEAR FOR A FIVE YEAR INVESTMENT CYCLE. IT DID YOU SAY BILLION I SAID BILLION. THAT I SAID THAT I SEE MILLION. OKAY YEAH. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT WE'VE ARE. EXECUTED BMO YOU ALREADY AND I LEAVE TOMORROW TO BEGIN. THE VARIOUS APPROVAL PROCESS WITH CHINESE REGULATORS. AND BEGIN TO BRING ALL THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORT AND I WOULD ADD MADAM CHAMP CHAIRMAN. THAT THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN. HAVE YOU PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP ON. AS CHINA REALLY BEGINS TO LOOK OUT CROSS BORDER INVESTMENTS WITH A FINE OR I. AND THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY VERY BIG CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW TO MIGRATE. CHINESE ARM BE IN CROSS BORDER INVESTMENT SO I THINK THE. PARTICIPATION OF VARIOUS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO PROPERLY SUBSTANTIATE AND SUPPORT QUALIFIED DEALS. SO THAT THE INTENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S CAN BE SUPPORTED AND AUTHENTICATED AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. COULD AND SHOULD HAPPEN. MOVING FORWARD. I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW SHARE A FEW PRESCRIPTIVE IDEAS. AS WE LOOK TO. A NEW ADMINISTRATION NEXT YEAR. AS YOU BEGIN TO PUT OF THIS MASTER PLAN AND STRATEGY TOGETHER I WOULD URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE. IN SUPPORTING THE. INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE GREAT WORK THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE TO ENSURE CONTINUITY. AND AS A CALIFORNIAN I I GO TO CHINA ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. ON AVERAGE. EYES AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW ARE ON THE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IT'S A LITTLE SO. VIS A VIS ENGAGEMENT SUCH A CREATING AN INFORMATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE. SO THAT ALL THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENCIES CAN PARTICIPATE IN TO MARKET. A CALIFORNIA ON A SUSTAINED BASIS WILL MORE THAN PAY FOR ITSELF. TOURISM. CONTINUE TO WORK AND BRING ALL OF US TOGETHER AND HOSTING IS YOUR ABILITY TO CONVENE IS EXTRAORDINARY TO CONTINUE TO BRING THESE ARE. ECOSYSTEMS IN THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN NETWORK AND SUPPORTING EACH OTHER. I THINK TO ENGAGE ALL OF YOUR MEMBERS. TO REACH OUT. TO GO TO YOUR LOCAL DISTRICTS FOR VIABLE PROJECTS AND I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. TO ENGAGE IN THE LIKES OF YOU KNOW I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND HAVE YOU SPEAK. AS I DO THINK. GETTING THE WORD OUT AND SHARING INFORMATION AND THEN. YOU KNOW. EVERY TIME WE HOSTED CHINESE DELEGATION THEY ALWAYS ASK THE SAME THING SHOW IS THE LIST OF PROJECTS. SHOWS THE LIST OF PROJECTS. AND. YEAH THERE IS A WAY TO BRING PEACE PROJECTS TOGETHER A DATUM AND AND TO A LIKE A DATABASE OF VIABLE PROJECTS THAT CAN BE SHARED ON A REGULAR BASIS I THINK THAT WOULD BE. A GREAT RESOURCE AND TOWARD BECAUSE I DO THINK THE INTENTION. TO INVESTORS THERE. AND TO REALLY ENGAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN. UP BRINGING FORTH THESE PROJECTS THEREFORE THE THE ROLE OF LAWYERS AND INVESTMENT BANKERS SIX ULTRA TO REALLY BRING TO QUALIFY DEALS TO THE TABLE IN A DISCREET MANNER THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT. I WOULD SAY WOULD BE CONSTRUCTIVE SO. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SHARE. SOME OF MY ACTIVITIES AND THOUGHTS. I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S A VERY PRAGMATIC AND ACTUALLY SO DETAILED THAT WE CAN GO BACK. ON AFTER WE CONVENE THIS PANEL AND REALLY HAVE SOME GO TO STEPS AS FAR AS. LOVE FURTHER OF ACTIVITIES THAT WE CAN PURSUE AND LA I THINK EVERYTHING FROM MAKING SURE OUR OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING SO THEY CAN LOOK WHAT'S IN THEIR DISTRICTS FOR AS YOU SAY PROJECTS. AND EVERYBODY'S INTERESTED IN THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THEN WE HAVE OUR LAST TOOK GAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

YOUR RESOURCES IN PARTNERSHIP PER KEY ELEMENTS TO OUR SUCCESS SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE LOS ANGELES SBDC NETWORK REPRESENTS THE FOURTH LARGEST SBDC NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. IN HIS DISTINCTIVE IN THE FACT THAT IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE LARGEST REGION UNITED STATES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE. THROUGHOUT THE EIGHT SPDC CENTERS THE LOS ANGELES NETWORK LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TWO OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIRMS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF WHICH CONDUCT BUSINESS IN CHINA IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. AREAS OF ASSISTANCE TO THESE BUSINESSES RANGE FROM LOGISTICS FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FDI REGULATIONS. FINANCE TOURISM ANY COMMERCE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO A CHINESE START UP IN LOS ANGELES. THAT LAUNCHED AN EXPORT COMPANY OF U. S. PRODUCTS AS WELL AS REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND FOR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. LIKE MOST START UP VENTURES. THIS CLIENT NEEDED OUR ASSISTANCE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL AS TO UNDERSTAND LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANT EXPORT REGULATIONS. THIS CHINESE STARTUP COMPANY WITHIN ITS FIRST YEAR WORKING WITH THE SPDC. GENERATE INVESTMENTS LOS ANGELES OF OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. LAST YEAR THE SAME FIRM EXPANDED TO THREE OTHER PROJECTS. TOTALING OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS. THIS INCLUDED THE B. FIVE AS WELL AS OTHER DIRECT INVESTMENTS. FURTHER WE WORKED WITH THE U. S. MANUFACTURING FIRM. IT'S SECURED SECOND ROUND VENTURE FUNDING AS A RESULT OF ACCESSING STRATEGIC MARKETS OVERSEAS INCLUDING CHINA. THE RESULT OF OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN THIS AREA OF TRADE COMPLIANCE. TARIFFS LOGISTICS HELP THIS COMPANY NOW ONLY ACHIEVED ITS FIRST PROFITABLE YEAR. BUT ALSO LED TO A SECOND ROUND FUNDING OF EIGHTEEN MILLION LAST YEAR WHEN THEY ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN JANUARY. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH INTERNATIONAL TRADE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE SPDC. AND THE ROLE CHINA PLAYS IN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS STRATEGY. TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR STATES SMALL BUSINESSES. AND CHINA OR SBDC PROGRAM HAS PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO FOSTER GROWTH IN THIS AREA. FOR EXAMPLE IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN WE PARTICIPATED IN A CLEAN TECH TRADE MISSION. SPONSORED BY THE KELLY XIN CHAMBER IN GOBIZ. BECAUSE OF THIS MISSION. WE ENGAGE WITH THE NUMBER OF CHINESE FIRMS WANTING TO SET UP CLEAN TECH BUSINESSES WITHIN VENTURA COUNTY. WE ALSO ESTABLISHED IN OFFICE SPACE IN THAT CALIFORNIA STATE TRADE OFFICE IN SHANGHAI. TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CHINESE FIRMS WHO WANT TO START BUSINESSES IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION. THIS OFFICE IS STAFFED BY ONE OF OUR SPDC ADVISORS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. TO PROVIDE BI LINGUAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO START OUT. E. COMMERCE IS ANOTHER ESSENTIAL AREA OF FOCUS WITHIN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPDC INITIATIVE. WE'VE ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF EXPERTS IN THE AREA OF E. COMMERCE BE TO BEING IN BBC. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE. PARTNERED WITH GT GLOBAL WHO REPRESENTS ONE THE LARGEST SPEED TO SEE. E. COMMERCE PLATFORMS IN CHINA. THIS PLATFORM IN SIMILAR. ONES NORMALLY COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO ACCESS THE CHINA MARKET. WHICH IS OVER DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE U. S. ONLINE MARKET WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BUYERS. THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH GT GLOBAL WEAKENED OFFERED GT GLOBAL PLATFORM AND FULL SUPPORT IN CREATING AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN FACT WE ALSO. PART DURING WITH THE STATE STEP PROGRAM WE'VE ALREADY. THEY'VE ALREADY GRANTED SOME OF OUR CLIENTS THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANTS. TO PUT TOWARDS STD MEMBERSHIP. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN A GLOBAL WORLD WE HAVE ALSO FOR FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON FOSTERING ENTREPRENEURIAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND CHINESE FIRMS. AND THEIR INVESTORS SO FOR EXAMPLE. THROUGH THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP WE'VE ESTABLISHED AN AMMO YOU. WITH THE REGION'S FIRST CROSS BORDER U. S. CHINA CO WORKING SPACE AND GLOBAL ACCELERATOR CALLED THE I DREAM SPACE. THERE ARE GREEN IT WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RESIDENTS OF THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. PROVIDING BILINGUAL START UP AND ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO BOTH U. S. FIRMS IN INVESTORS INTERESTED IN PENETRATING THE CHINA ENTREPRENEURIAL SPACE. AS WELL AS CHINA FIRMS LOOKING TO BASE THEIR U. S. START UPS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA. FINALLY THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORT. OF INVEST SHANGHAI DAILY CHAMBER LYRICS. US DEPARTMENT COMMERCE IN THE SAME GABRIEL VALLEY THIS PARTNERSHIP. WILL BE SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA EXPORTERS IN CHINESE BUYERS. OF U. S. NATURAL PRODUCTS IN E. COMMERCE IN THE FIRST IMPORT EXPO IN SHANGHAI IN NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE RECRUITING BOTH CHINESE BUYERS AND CALIFORNIA SELLERS PRIOR TO THE SHOW. TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. CULMINATING IN THE SHOW BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ECONOMIC OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES OF NATURAL PRODUCTS. SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING YOU ON ALL THESE INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS AND. I ALSO WANT TO THINK JUST THE. THE WHOLE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE HERE WE AT YA I REALLY LOOK AT HER SUPPORT PARTNERS AS A FAMILY AND. YOU KNOW I ECHO ARE COLLEAGUES AT SAY IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE DEDICATED TO BUILDING. THE U. S. CHINA TRADE LANE BUT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP. WELL I CERTAINLY CAN SEE HOW ON NOT ONLY INVOLVED YOU ARE BUT EVERYBODY WHO CAME HERE ON BEHALF OF CHINA AND I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT DID THAT IT IS. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE TO FIRST BE. NURTURED AND I WAS THINKING I AS I I HAVE HEARD THIS PRESENTATION AND AGAIN REMEMBERING. BEING AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FIRST ALMOST THIRTY YEARS IT'S IT'S MUCH LIKE A SCENE THAT YOU PLANT AND IT HAS TO BE NURTURED IN AS YOU START TO SEE THESE INVESTMENTS GROWING GROW ON BOTH SIDES. WHETHER IT'S AN INVESTMENTS IN CHINA OR CHINA INVESTING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT OVER THE YEARS AND REALLY MANY MANY YEARS THIS. BRANCHES OF GROWING IF YOU WANT TO USE THE METAPHOR OF A TREE. AND NOW THEY'RE NOT ONLY GROWING BUT WE HAVE ALMOST LIKE A IT MANY MANY TREES A FARM OF TREES AND. I WOULD SAY THAT. WHETHER IT'S EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES BUSINESS EXCHANGES CULTURAL EXCHANGES THERE'S UP MANY MORE OF GROWTH THAT WE CAN DO AS WE'VE SEEN THAT CALIFORNIA IS A VERY DIVERSE IN PLACE THAT CHINA WANTS TO. INVEST IN SO THAT WE MAY HAVE A FOREST OF OF GROWTH BUT I DO WANNA JUST REFLECT ON A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT. I HAVE HEARD THAT I THINK ARE INCREDIBLE OF THAT IN SOMETIMES AS A TEACHER WE LEARN AND I KNOW MYSELF SOME OF YOU TAKING NOTES YOU CONTINUE TO LEARN. EVEN OUR CONSULTANT BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER AND DO A BETTER JOB AT ON OUR INVESTMENTS BUT. WAY BACK FROM THE BUILDING OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. THAT IS IN FACT IN OUR CALIFORNIA HISTORY BOOKS. THAT. YOU ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THOUGH. IF THEY THINK THAT WE WANT TO GET THAT MOVING FASTER BUT ALSO TO THE BORDER OF MEXICO LEE AND THAT HISTORY THERE. BUT EVEN NOW TO SEEING THAT MORE AND MORE FAMILIES IN AMERICA ARE VALUING THE IDEA OF KEEPING UP THE LANGUAGE WITH THE DUAL IMMERSION PROGRAMS. AND FOR A LONG PERIOD WE SAW MANY OF OUR. STUDENTS WHETHER IT BE SPANISH CHINESE OR ANY OTHER. LANGUAGES OF LOSING THAT LANGUAGE UP BECAUSE THERE WASN'T. INNOCENCE OF. THE VALUE OF THAT CULTURE AND WE WOULD SEE A FAMILIES COMMUNICATING AT A VERY LOW LEVEL JUST WITH ONE OR TWO WORDS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EVER. ABLE SO AS A TEACHER OF ALWAYS TOLD. MY STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CONTINUE READING YOUR STORIES CONTINUE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE KEEP THAT OUR CULTURAL UP BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT. WHAT'S VERY IMPRESSES TO HEAR IS INVESTMENTS ARE GROUNDED IN JOBS IN THE ECONOMY AND THAT HOW A THOSE JOBS ARE NOT ONLY AVAILABLE IN CHINA FOR OUR AMERICANS TO GO THERE. BUT THERE ARE BEING JOBS BROUGHT HERE AND AND STARTED HERE WITH INVESTMENT OF CHINESE ON VESTMENTS SO THOUGH I THINK WE HAVE. A NOT ONLY A GREAT. INVESTMENT NOW BUT WHAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW I CAN TELL YOU I. AM PERSONALLY VERY MUCH WOULD LOVE TO GO ON ONE OF THE DELEGATIONS I HEARD OF MANY OF THEM TODAY BUT. NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT OTHERS AND I KNOW THOUGH FURTHER OUT THAT WE KNOW ABOUT IT A. THE MORE PLANNING THAT WE CAN DO MADAM CHAIR WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO BE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS CHINA BUSINESS SUMMIT ON MAY THIRD. HERE IN THE SOUTH LAND SO THAT WHERE WHERE WOULD THAT BE WOULD BE AT THE BEVERLY HILTON HOTEL HEY WE WILL. TRY TO GET THEREFORE NOT IN SESSION HERE DEPENDING ON THAT DAY OF THE THIRD I THINK I'LL MEMBERS ARE FLYING OUT JUST SUDDENLY AFTERNOON BUT I'M SURE WE CAN FIND WE WILL TRY.
