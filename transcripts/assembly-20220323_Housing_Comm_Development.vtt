YES I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.684
GREAT QUESTION- IT AND I THINK

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.086
THE GOOD NEWS FOR US IS WE'RE

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.954
TARGETING A POPULATION THAT IS

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:05.621
OVERWHELMINGLY AND ALMOST

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:06.789
EXCLUSIVELY AND MEET A COMING

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.691
HOME FROM CAR SERRATION IN THE

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.692
LA TIMES OF SUPPORT EDITORIAL

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:12.295
WITH A HE JUST THIS QUESTION WE

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:12.929
GIVE PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.564
OF GATE MONEY AND WE SAY GOOD

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.731
LUCK- MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.700
INCARCERATED HAD. A HOUSING AND

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.035
SECURITY PRIOR TO INCARCERATION

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.137
AT FOOD INSECURITY HAD A LIMITED

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.939
ECONOMIC MOBILITY- FROM

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:23.940
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAME FROM

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.408
AND THOSE WERE ONLY EXACERBATED

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.609
BY THE TIME THE STATE PRISON

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:27.810
THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE PAID

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.645
THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND ARE

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.746
COMING HOME TO VIRTUALLY

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.381
NOTHING. AND AS A RESULT

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:32.982
DISPROPORTIONATE FALL INTO OUR

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.250
HOMELESS POPULATION SO I'M NOT A

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.785
CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT THIS

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.420
PROGRAM BEING ABUSED BY FOLKS

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.855
WHO ARE INCARCERATED FOR YEARS

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:39.956
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.691
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO COME HOME

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.726
TO I THINK A BY TARGETING THIS

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:44.727
POPULATION IN LIFTING FROM THE

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:47.263
BOTTOM- YOU WEED OUT PEOPLE WHO

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.999
MIGHT. OTHERWISE NOT BE THIS

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.834
OPPORTUNITY. AND ONE OF THE-

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:52.602
CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT OUR

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.337
APPROACH I MEAN THERE'S

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.805
DEFINITELY A SPACE FOR THE-

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.340
APPROACH ON THAT SIDE WHEN THEY

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.942
GET OUT. BUT WE DON'T SPEND A

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.678
LOT OF TIME ON LOOKING AT THE

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:05.414
INCARCERATION SYSTEM ITSELF AND

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.016
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:09.051
THAT PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED TO

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.554
ENSURE THAT WHEN THEY DO COME

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.655
OUT. THEY ARE DRUG FREE THEY

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.590
HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED IT FOR

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.392
INACTIVE FOR LENGTH OF TIME THAT

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.828
WILL TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE-

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:19.996
THIRTY DAYS DOES NOT MAKE A

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.731
DIFFERENCE THIRTY DAYS IS THIRTY

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.966
DAYS OF DRY AND THEN GET OUT AND

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.801
FIND. WHAT YOU WERE DOING BEFORE

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.670
AND THEN THEY GO RIGHT BACK TO

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.639
IT- IF WE'RE SPENDING ALL OUR

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.240
MONEY ON THIS SIDE AND NOT

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:32.808
SPENDING ANY MONEY ON THE OTHER

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.710
SIDE TO REFORM THAT PART OF IT

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:35.945
SO THAT PEOPLE THAT CAN BE

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.747
REHABILITATED TRULY HAVE THAT

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:41.083
OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHABILITATED

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.085
. THEY CAN BE JOB TRAINED. THEY

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:45.421
CAN BE DRUG FREE AND THEY CAN

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.123
HAVE A PIPELINE INTO THE

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.791
MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT ARE OUT

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.660
THERE THEIR ON FIELD. THAT WILL

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:53.329
HELP SUPPORT THEM IN A LESS TIME

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.298
THAN WORKERS SAYING THAT THIS

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.333
THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM WOULD DO.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.869
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE IF A EIGHT A

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.804
MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.640
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. AND

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.275
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE BEFORE

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.877
THEY GET OUT WHILE THEY'RE DOING

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.478
THEIR TIME WHILE THEY'RE SERVING

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.881
THEIR TIME. SO THAT WHEN THEY

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:12.848
COME OUT WE DON'T GET STE WE

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.817
WERE NOT IN THE SITUATION WHERE

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:17.153
THEY NEED DRUG COUNSELING. MARK

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.789
AND ALL THESE AND JOB TRAINING

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.823
THEY SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THAT

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.825
DONE AND IF WE'RE NOT DOING THAT

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.927
THAT'S OUR FAILURE. AND THAT'S

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:26.095
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY REALLY

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:27.530
NEED TO ADDRESS IT FOR ACTUALLY

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:29.465
GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT. ON

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.133
THESE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.135
WE'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO FIND

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.870
ENOUGH HOUSING. FOR THE HOMELESS

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.206
POPULATION IS OUT THERE. AND A

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.975
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.309
ALREADY OUT THERE ON A-

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.011
VOLUNTARY BASIS WILL NOT COME

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.313
IN. FOR DRUG TREATMENT. MADE

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.048
THEY SIMPLY WILL GO BACK TO

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.950
BEING HOMELESS INSTEAD OF NOT

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:49.819
TAKING. YOU KNOW TO NOT HAVING

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.655
THEIR DRUGS. SO I HAVE A LOT AND

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.724
I MEAN THIS IS A VERY VERY

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.426
COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND AND SO I

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.829
JUST HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. MORE

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.565
MORE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO DO. WORK

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.900
ON ONE SIDE WITHOUT TRYING TO

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.570
FIX THE OTHER SIDE- SO ANYWAY I

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:08.838
APPRECIATE YOUR BILL IN THERE

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:10.740
THE ATTEMPTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:12.975
TO TRY TO. ADDRESS THE AT LEAST

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.710
THE ONE SIDE NO I APPRECIATE

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.312
THAT AND THERE IS AN IN REACH

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.281
COMPONENT TO OUR BILL TO START

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:18.914
LOOKING FOR SOME THESE HOUSING

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.583
MY FOLKS ARE STILL. INCARCERATED

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.951
IN AND WERE IN FULL AGREEMENT

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.786
THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE BEFORE

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.621
AND I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S EVEN A

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:26.756
THIRD SIDE. AND THAT'S PRIOR TO

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.090
FOLKS EVER BEING INCARCERATED TO

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.725
BEGIN WITH RIGHT THERE'S A LOT

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.128
WE HAVE TO DO TO BUILD UP OUR

SOCIAL. AND PUBLIC AND CIVIC

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:34.764
INFRASTRUCTURES THAT PEOPLE

THAT THE SENATE ELIMINATE IT

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.333

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:39.253
QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED ME WHAT

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.622
WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU'RE NOT THE

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.156
WHOLE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN

ANSWER THAT BECAUSE- THIS IS A

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.426

ACTUALLY LETTING THE LOCAL

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:48.129
JURISDICTION. MAKE THAT DECISION

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.031

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.466
GOLF COURSES IN RECENT YEARS THE

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.066

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.068
CONVERSATION THEY'VE OPTED TO

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.604
KEEP THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.006
TEN YEARS NOW THEY OPTED. NOT

01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.574
KEEP ONE OF THEM THAT AGAIN WILL

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.509
BE A LOCAL CONVERSATION THAT IF

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:03.444
THEY CHOOSE TO GO THAT DIRECTION

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.679
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:05.980
IS AN ASSAULT IS A BIGGER CITY

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.849
WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUDGET

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:08.716

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.586
SMALLER JUST I JUST CAN'T EVEN

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:12.920
CAN'T EVEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:13.621
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:14.122

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:30.905

THERE AND DON'T. THEY THEY MAKE

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.412
THE ARGUMENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.313
AS TO WHAT THE USE OF THOSE

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:39.947
COURSE SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED LATE

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:41.916
IT SHOULD BE RATIONALLY. BRING

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.117
IN THAT CONVERSATION BACK TO THE

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:44.652

ISSUE HERE WHICH IS THAT IT'S

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:04.444
WAY TOO HARD FOR FOLKS TO GET

FIGURE OUT IF THIS REALLY

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:17.623
REINFORCES SOURCE OF INCOME

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:18.658
DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORK THAT

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:19.859

AND I YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.559
HEARD FROM THE WITNESS IN

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:27.860
OPPOSITION YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA

01:59:27.927 --> 01:59:29.462
MAKE THE LANDLORD MORE RELUCTANT

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:30.730
TO ACTUALLY LEASED TO A PERSON.

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:33.032
WHO IS LOW INCOME IN WHO HAS THE

WE JUST SORT OF REPLACING ONE

01:59:38.638 --> 01:59:39.739
BARRIER WITH ANOTHER I MEAN I

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:40.806
WAS READING IN THE ANALYSIS

01:59:40.873 --> 01:59:42.542
ABOUT THAT THEY'LL ASK FOLKS FOR

01:59:42.608 --> 01:59:44.143
TAX RECORDS AND BANK RECORDS AND

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:46.012
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS AND THOSE. AT

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:47.747

I'M OPEN TO BEING PERSUADED

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.616
OTHERWISE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:51.851
COULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO GO

01:59:51.918 --> 01:59:53.686
COLLECT RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO GO

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:55.621

BE- I THINK THOSE COULD

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:06.699
POTENTIALLY POSE BERRIES AND YOU

02:00:06.766 --> 02:00:08.234
KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.468
THE REASONS WE HAVE CREDIT

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:11.137
SCORES RIGHT AS ITS- AGGREGATES

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:11.938

I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD.

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:15.575
SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE PART OF OUR-

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:16.309
OF REQUIRING A CREDIT CHECK

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:18.077
THERE'S ALWAYS A FEAT THAT GOES

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:20.246
TOWARD- GETTING THE CREDIT

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:24.517
REPORT- AS I SAID IN MY-

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:25.785
STATEMENT. BOB THESE THE

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:26.819
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE APPLYING

02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:29.155
SOMETIMES IT'S USED TYPICALLY

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:29.956
FORTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:31.424
CREDIT CHECK. AND THEY'RE

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:34.994
APPLYING FOR MULTIPLE- RENTAL

02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:37.063
UNITS RIGHT AND THERE THEY GET

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.764
REJECTED FROM ALL OF THEM

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:41.634
SPENDING FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:44.003
DOLLARS AND SO. THIS IS NOT ONLY

02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:46.806
A BARRIER TO FOR THEM TO GET

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:51.277
THE GOVERNMENT

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:53.312
RIGHT IF SOMEONE HAS A HOUSING

02:00:53.379 --> 02:00:55.448
SUBSIDY THE LANDLORD KNOWS

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:57.516
THEY'RE GOING TO GET PAID. RIGHT

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.919
AND SO WHY ARE WE PUTTING THIS

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:03.255
BARRIER THERE RIGHT THE OTHER-

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:04.991
ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:06.659
WILL BE COLLECTED IT DOESN'T

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:09.462
COST. ANYTHING TO COLLECT THAT

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:11.464
SHOW IS SO THEN THE CREDIT CHECK

02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:13.032
I CAN'T I CAN'T YOU CAN'T

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:15.901
PROVIDE A CREDIT CHECK IF THE

02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:18.137
LANDLORD HAS TO PAY A SERVER S.

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:19.238
TWO. TO COLLECT THAT CREDIT

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:21.574
REPORT. DOWN TO THE NEW ISSUE

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:22.775
HERE I GUESS I'M UNDERSTANDING

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:24.276
IS IT'S LESS THE INFORMATION

02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:25.177
CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT REPORT

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:27.346
IT'S MORE THE FEE. TO RUN THE

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:29.181
CREDIT REPORT. I THINK IT'S BOTH

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:31.283
OKAY. AND ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE.

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:33.486
THAT HAVE LITTLE TO NO CREDIT

02:01:33.552 --> 02:01:36.155
HISTORY RIGHT THEY CAN BE PAYING

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:37.990
FOR A CREDIT REPORT. AND IT

AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO IT

02:03:00.773 --> 02:03:02.908
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY. RIGHT

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:03.909
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF

02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:07.313

THE FACT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS-

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:48.154
WHAT I THINK THE BEST WAY TO GET

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.256
AT THAT ISSUE IS CAN I ASK MADAM

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:51.657

AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:06.839
HERE AND THERE MIGHT E OTHER

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:09.341

THE SPOT A LITTLE BIT WHAT ARE

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:18.083
SOME OTHER WAYS THAT YOU THINK

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:19.785
MAYBE. WE COULD ACCOMPLISH SOME

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:20.653
OF THESE OBJECTIVES CERTAINLY

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:22.121
WELL WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:23.889
DOES NOT PAY ALL OF YOUR RENT

02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:25.357
DOESN'T PAY YOUR BILLS EXCEPT

02:04:25.424 --> 02:04:26.625
TRACK- THERE COULD BE A FUNDING

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:28.561
PROGRAM TO HELP- WITH THE

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:29.795
ACCUMULATION OF THE CREDIT

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.564
REPORT THERE'S THIRD PARTY CIVIL

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:34.400
HOW'S YOUR CREDIT REPORT- ON AN

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:36.735
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM- I KNOW WE'RE

02:04:36.802 --> 02:04:38.537
TALKING WITH A SOME MEMBER WARD

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:40.639
ABOUT OPTIONS LIKE THAT. SO THAT

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:41.974
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY EVERY

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.943
SINGLE TIME BUT THAT ONLY SOLVED

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:45.244
PART OF YOUR ISSUE RIGHT I THINK

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:47.112
THE I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON WHEN

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:49.014
YOU INDICATED THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:50.983
TAKE A LONG TIME FOR AN

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.750
INDIVIDUAL TO COLLECT ALL THIS

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:54.086
DATA IF THEY CAN'T- THEIR CREDIT

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:56.488
REPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE- AND BY

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:58.457
THEN THE- THE UNITS RENTED. SO I

02:04:58.524 --> 02:05:00.793
THINK THAT THAT IS A BARRIER SO

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.794
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.562
DIFFERENT WAYS OF IT'S JUST

02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:05.397
ABOUT I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:06.966
REDUCE ADULTS ABOUT TWO THINGS

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:08.667
IT'S THE COST OF THE CREDIT

02:05:08.734 --> 02:05:12.171
REPORT- AND IT'S ABOUT THE

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:15.174
CREDIT SCORE NOW IN TALKING WITH

02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:17.176
MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.244
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THEY SAY

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:19.845
THE CREDIT SCORE IS NOT THE ONLY

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:21.680
THING THEY USE. THEY USE

02:05:21.747 --> 02:05:23.916
EVERYTHING- DURING THE LAST

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:25.317
FORECLOSURE CRISIS EVERYBODY

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:26.652
BECAME SEEM LIKE EVERYBODY THAT

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.888
CAME TO APPLY HOW TO FOR CLOSURE

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.389
ON THE RECORD SO LANDLORDS

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:31.857
SHOULD STOP USING THAT SCORE

02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:33.559
IT'S JUST NOT A SCORE THAT IS

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:35.527
NECESSARILY DEPENDABLE ANYMORE.

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:38.130
SO THEY HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:42.101
DON'T USE JUST THE CREDIT SCORE

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:42.935
BUT A LOT OF OTHER INFORMATION.

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.737
LANDLORDS CAN ASK FOR BANK

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:48.040

AWHILE TO COLLECT RIGHT IN OF IT

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:00.786
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:02.721
AND THEY OF COURSE I HAD TO PAY

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.757
A FEE FOR A CREDIT SCORE- BUT

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:06.525
THIS THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:08.694
IT'S ONLY FOR THOSE. THAT HAVE A

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:11.897
PUBLIC SUBSIDY RIGHT IT'S NOT

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:13.132
YOU KNOW I DON'T AGREE THAT

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:15.467
EVERYONE SHOULD NOT GET YOU KNOW

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:17.503
SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A CREDIT

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:19.939

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:31.917
SUCH A PAIN IN THE **** TO GO

REALLY IT REALLY STIMULATED MY

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:43.862
THINKING ABOUT. THE KIND OF

02:06:43.929 --> 02:06:45.764
BARRIERS THAT WE MIGHT SET UP SO

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:46.865

INTRIGUED BY WHAT YOU MENTION I

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:51.971

02:06:54.907 --> 02:06:56.809
CHECK ONCE AND THEN HAVING THAT

OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:01.914
THAT. THAT DID CATCH MY

02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:03.582
ATTENTION AS A REAL ISSUE FOR

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:04.650
LOW INCOME FOLKS WHO ARE

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:05.884
SEARCHING FOR SOMEWHERE TO USE

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:06.852

02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:22.501
BARRIER. RIGHT YOU ALREADY HAVE

FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:34.179
I THINK WOULD- MY COLLEAGUE ALSO

02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:37.182
BRINGS UP IN TERMS OF.

02:07:37.249 --> 02:07:39.018
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:41.754
REQUESTING- A CREDIT SCORES FROM

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.556
OR YOUR BILL FOR POTENTIALLY

02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:47.593
NOT- REQUESTING. AS COURSE FROM

02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:49.928
REALLY IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE IT'S

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:52.197
A PIVOTING OF TRYING TO HAVE A

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:53.232
CONVERSATION BETWEEN US VERSUS

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:56.301
THEM THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ALREADY.

02:07:56.368 --> 02:07:57.770
BUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED I THINK

02:07:57.836 --> 02:07:59.872
EVEN A MINUTE THE CALL THE

02:07:59.938 --> 02:08:01.306
NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS THAT THE

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:03.108
SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:05.344
BEFORE DIDN'T WORK. AND SO WE

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.979
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:09.314
SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU HAVE I

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:11.717
THINK YOU KNOW SAID IT REALLY

02:08:11.784 --> 02:08:14.286
WELL IN TERMS OF. INDIVIDUALS

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:16.288
THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:18.123
WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN A CYCLE

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:20.626
OF POVERTY BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:22.961
OPPORTUNITY THERE THE BARRIERS

02:08:23.028 --> 02:08:25.164
OF ENTRY ARE VERY HIGH. AND SO

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:26.799
THEN HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT AND

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.867
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:30.302
WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:32.104
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ON THE

02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:34.039
PREVENTION SIDE NOT FOR FOLKS

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:35.507
THAT ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING

02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:36.842
THAT BUT HOW DO WE MAKE IT

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:39.578
EASIER FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE AXES

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:41.246
. HOW TO A RENTAL UNIT AND I

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:43.348
THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IS THE

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:45.184
HEART OF YOUR BILL. AND WHAT

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:46.318
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:48.053
TERMS OF. COMMUNITIES AND

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.855
FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:52.758
COUNTRIES- THOSE ACCESS TO ENTRY

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:54.626
AS EASILY AS IT IS AVAILABLE.

02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:56.061
AND EVEN MORE SO YOUNG PEOPLE

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:58.363
GET CAUGHT UP WITHOUT CREDIT

02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:59.998
CARDS WHEN THEY FIRST ENTER A

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.600
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SETTING I

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.836
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT EAST LA

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:04.736
COLLEGE. THE FIRST THING THAT I

02:09:04.803 --> 02:09:05.971
ENCOUNTER WITH SOMEONE TRYING TO

02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:08.207
GET ME TO GET A VISA AND BEFORE

02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:11.143
I. BEFORE I EVEN KNEW IT I WAS

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.480
ALREADY AND THAT. AND SO BY.

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.215
NINETEEN MY CREDIT SCORE BECAUSE

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:17.049
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:18.617
CREDIT AND FINANCIAL LITERACY

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:19.751
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.653
AVAILABLE IN MY COMMUNITY. I

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.755
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF

02:09:23.822 --> 02:09:25.824
ALL OF THAT MEANT TO MY FUTURE

02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:27.926
AND MY ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO-

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.661
RENT AN APARTMENT AT CETERA AND

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:32.498
IT TOOK SOME TIME- TO LIKE

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:34.500
REBUILD MY CREDIT. SO YEAH I

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:36.368
THINK WHAT IT THE CONVERSATIONS

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:38.737
AROUND FINANCIAL LITERACY AROUND

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:42.374
EQUITY AROUND RESOURCES AROUND.

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:44.443
US SYSTEMS THAT DON'T THAT

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.478
AREN'T NECESSARILY EQUAL TO ALL.

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:48.814
IS A LARGER CONVERSATION- IN

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:51.116
TERMS OF HOW WE PROGRAM MOVING

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:53.752
FORWARD. AND HOW ULTIMATELY WE

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:56.088
HELP FAMILIES IT'S NOT. AN END

02:09:56.155 --> 02:09:57.890
ALL BE ALL LIKE A CREDIT SCORE

02:09:57.956 --> 02:10:01.093
IS A REFLECTION OF A OF A STAMP

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.661
IN SOMEONE'S LIFE IT IS NOT A

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:04.563
REFLECTION OF THEIR WHOLE LIFE.

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:07.032
BUT WE USE THESE REPORTS TO KIND

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:08.734
OF PAINT A PICTURE WHETHER IT'S

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.802
GOOD OR BAD OR IN BETWEEN. AND

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.070
ULTIMATELY THERE ARE FAMILIES

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:13.672
OUT THERE STRUGGLING THAT SIMPLY

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:15.407
NEED AN OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:16.742
AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:18.577
WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH. AND

02:10:18.644 --> 02:10:19.878
GOVERNMENT SO JUST WANTED TO

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:23.582
STATE THAT FOR THE RECORD I'M

02:10:23.649 --> 02:10:25.551

SPACE- QUITE A BIT THIS BILL

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:35.160
DOES BRING UP A LITTLE BIT OF-

02:10:35.227 --> 02:10:36.995
MIXED FEELINGS BECAUSE ON THE

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:38.997

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:41.900
PARTICULAR GROUP THAT ALREADY

HAS IF YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:46.438
YOUR IN THEIR HAND I WOULD NOTE

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:48.974
THAT SOMEBODY THAT ACTUALLY GETS

INTO A VOUCHER IN THEIR HAND-

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:53.545
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A- MANY

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:56.848
TIMES YEARS OF BEING ON A LIST

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.817
TO GET THIS PARTICULAR VOUCHER.

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:01.820
AND VETTING IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GO

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.822
TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEY'RE

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:05.390
JUST HANDING THEM OUT NO THERE

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:08.260
IS A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS BUT ON

02:11:08.327 --> 02:11:10.362
THE OTHER HAND IN THIS IS WHERE

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.663
I MEAN SOMETIMES WE'RE WE'RE

02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:12.831
DOING THIS AT THE DIETS BUT

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:14.566
SOMETIMES THERE THERE ARE THE

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:16.735
UNINTENDED QUAN CONSEQUENCES IN

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:19.271
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- YOU

MENTIONED- WHICH IS IF THEY'RE

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:24.776
NOT GOING TO SEE A CREDIT.

02:11:24.843 --> 02:11:26.011
REPORT THEY'RE GOING TO USE

02:11:26.078 --> 02:11:28.013
SOMETHING ELSE. AND IS THAT IN

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.581
TURN GOING TO BE THE SAME

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:31.817
BARRIER WHICH IS WE KNOW IF YOU

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:33.685
PULL A BANKING RECORDS FROM

02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:34.953
SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY IN A

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.588
VULNERABLE POPULATION THEY MAY

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:38.357
NOT EVEN USE A TRADITIONAL

02:11:38.423 --> 02:11:39.625
BANKS. WE KNOW THAT THEY MAY

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:42.361
NOT- HAVE A CREDIT AS WE SAID

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:44.830
CREDIT CARDS. BECAUSE THEY MAY

02:11:44.896 --> 02:11:46.698
BE MONTH TO MONTH HAVING

02:11:46.765 --> 02:11:49.534
LITERALLY AS WE KNOW SOME FOLKS.

02:11:49.601 --> 02:11:51.403
THAT AREN'T DISABILITY THEY

02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:54.806
LITERALLY GET ELEVEN HUNDRED TO

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:55.674
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MAYBE

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:58.377
FOURTEEN HUNDRED- A MONTH. AND

02:11:58.443 --> 02:12:00.779
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:02.481
THOUSAND DOLLAR SAVINGS SO THIS

02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:04.516
IS REALLY KIND OF A PUSH AND

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:06.118
PULL BETWEEN PROTECTING THE

02:12:06.184 --> 02:12:09.454
INVESTORS. WHO ARE WHETHER

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.123

02:12:17.195 --> 02:12:18.697
PROTECTION BUT ALSO GIVEN THE

02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:21.867
OPPORTUNITY- FOR THOSE

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:23.168
INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE A

BELIEVE IT WAS A SACRAMENTO BEE-

02:12:30.575 --> 02:12:32.444
THAT CAME OUT MAYBE A MONTH AGO

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:33.812
ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO

02:12:33.879 --> 02:12:36.982
LITERALLY HAS A VOUCHER IN THEIR

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:38.750
HAND AND CANNOT USE IT IN

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:39.851
REMAINS HOMELESS AND THAT'S ONE

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:42.888
STORY. SO I'M DOING A LOT OF

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:45.357
SPEAKING HERE BUT IT IS A

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.658
CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO. TWO

LISTENING AND- YOU KNOW BUT IT'S

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.571
A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR THOSE

02:12:59.638 --> 02:13:01.773
OF US WHO ARE IN THE SPACE

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.443
WANTING TO SEE PEOPLE HOUSED.

THAT IF ONE GROUP- IS GOING TO

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:11.416
LET SOMEBODY INTO THAT UNIT AND

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:13.385
THEY CAN'T USE A CREDIT REPORT

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:14.553
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ANOTHER

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.955

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:43.768
APPROXIMATELY OF THAT MONEY

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:45.337
EVERY A VERY REGULAR CHECK. FROM

02:15:45.403 --> 02:15:46.738
THE GOVERNMENT HE DOES LEAVE AT

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:47.873
THE VERY LEAST IS THAT STABILITY

02:15:47.939 --> 02:15:49.641
THERE AND THEN THE FAMILY HAS

02:15:49.708 --> 02:15:51.109
COME UP WITH THE REST OF. THE

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:52.777
DAY. YOU KNOW IF HE WAS GONNA

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.813
SHOOT THAT FAMILY LIKE ANY OTHER

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:55.881
PERSON THE PRIVATE MARKET COMING

02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:56.915
IN THERE'S NO WAY THEY WOULD

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:59.784
HAVE GOTTEN AT HOME SO WHY DO WE

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:00.318
CREATE THESE PROGRAMS. THE

02:16:00.385 --> 02:16:02.053
BRIDGE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.088
STOCK ON THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY

02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:04.923
TO ACTUALLY USE VOUCHERS OVER

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:05.924
PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:07.259
NATIONALLY FOR. EVEN HER STATE

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:09.427
ALONE WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY BUT

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:11.263
AND YET THE PROBLEM WE WONDER

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.998
WHY THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. AND IS

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:15.100
BECAUSE THE BARRIERS ASK STOCK

02:16:15.166 --> 02:16:17.269
UPON THE CUMULATIVE. AND SO

02:16:17.335 --> 02:16:18.803
ULTIMATELY WHAT IS THAT

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:20.272
INFORMATION TELL YOU THAT YOU

02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:21.907
DON'T ALREADY KNOW BY THE FACT

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:24.309
THAT SOMEONE HAS QUALIFIED FOR A

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:25.410
VOUCHER. YOU KNOW THAT THEY IF

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:27.379
THEY HAD THE VOUCHER THAT. IS

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:29.014
GOOD THAT IS FOR A REASON AND AT

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.582
THE END THAT WERE COMING

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:32.183
TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY AND SAYING

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.152
AS A PUBLIC POLICY MATTERS. THAT

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:35.287
WE'RE GOING TO COMBINE SOME OF

02:16:35.353 --> 02:16:41.026
OUR MONEY. AS A SOCIETY. AND HOW

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.060
OUT THIS MAY. THAT I. WE'RE

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:44.296
PAYING A LOT MORE AS A- TO HAVE

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:46.064
THEM HOMELESS OR ON THE VERGE OF

02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.332
HOMELESSNESS. AND SO IT DOESN'T

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:49.200
IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR THAT

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:50.735
PERSON. OR THAT THAT FAMILY TO

02:16:50.802 --> 02:16:53.138
BE ABLE TO PAY RENT. OR DOESN'T

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:55.140
GET THE IN THE CREDIT SCORE BY

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:55.874
ITSELF DOES NOT GIVE THE

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.809
INDICATION. OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF

02:16:57.876 --> 02:16:59.844
THAT PERSON TO BE ABLE TO PAY

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:00.745
RENT. IF YOU'RE ADDING IT WITH

02:17:00.812 --> 02:17:02.747
THIS VOUCHER THE SUBS IF THEY

02:17:02.814 --> 02:17:04.049
HAVE. A IS IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:06.751
GIVE. AN ACTUAL PICTURE OF THE

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:08.787
RISK ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE THE

02:17:08.853 --> 02:17:09.854
GOVERNMENT'S ALREADY DONE THAT

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:13.291
RISK ASSESSMENT. FOR YOU. AND SO

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:16.027
AT THE END OF THE DAY LOOK YOU

02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:18.964
KNOW- WE HAVE TO. IT IS ABOUT

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:20.932
TWO DIFFERENT. KIND OF COMPETING

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:22.233
INTERESTS SOME EXTENDED END OF

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.802
THE DAY THE POP OF THE PUBLIC

02:17:23.868 --> 02:17:25.270
POLICY NEEDS. OF OUR HOUSING

02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:27.973
CRISIS. DICTATES THAT WE DO HAVE

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:30.475
A SOMETIMES PICK SIDES. AND ATM.

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:32.777
AND THE FACT THAT. IT'S ALWAYS A

02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:35.413
GOOD IT JUST WE'RE GOING TO SEE

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.715

THAT EQUATION. AND WE HAVE TO

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:51.162
DO. MORE THAN WE'VE BEEN DOING

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:52.530
TO MAKE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT

02:17:52.597 --> 02:17:57.268
EASIER FOR SOME. OF THESE

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:58.603

BANDAID TWO OF A LARGER PROBLEM

02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:56.755
WE ALL KNOW THE LARGER PROBLEM

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.990
IS WHEN YOU RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.325
FIFTY PEOPLE ONE APPLY FOR ONE

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:01.826
APARTMENT AND HALF OF THEM MIGHT

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:03.962
HAVE VOUCHERS OF. YOU KNOW WITH

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:07.098
A WHOLE RANGE OF A 50% OR A 100%

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.968
OR WHATEVER AND SO THAT MAKES IT

02:20:10.034 --> 02:20:12.137
REALLY DIFFICULT BUT A LOT OF

02:20:12.203 --> 02:20:13.872
ALL THE LANDOWNERS OUT THERE THE

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:15.607
- THEY'RE NOT ALL THAT BIG

02:20:15.673 --> 02:20:17.776
CORPORATIONS THEY'RE NOT ALL THE

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:19.244
HUGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THERE

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.712
LOT OF MOM AND POP FOLKS THAT

02:20:20.779 --> 02:20:23.114
OWN HAVE OVER THEIR YEARS- BEEN

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:26.384
ABLE TO ACQUIRE TWO OR THREE OR

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:26.918
FOUR PROPERTIES. AND THOSE

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:28.453
PROPERTIES ARE THEIR LIFELINE

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.021
THAT'S THEIR INCOME AND IF THEY

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.923
DON'T HAVE THAT INCOME AND THEY

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:33.258
DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE OF THAT

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:35.860
INCOME- DAN THEY TURN INTO

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:37.595
PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING TRYING

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:40.765
TO- YOU KNOW DO EXACTLY WHAT

02:20:40.832 --> 02:20:42.801
EVERYBODY ELSE IS JUST TRYING TO

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:44.302
SURVIVE. AND THEY DO USE THESE

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:46.070
TOOLS AND THAT'S ONE OF THEIR

02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:48.006
TOOLS IS DOING A CREDIT REPORT

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:50.175
AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RELY JUST

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:52.177
ON THAT CREDIT REPORT THAT'S

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:53.912
KIND OF A SNAPSHOT OF THE

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:55.380
OVERALL HISTORY BUT THEY ALSO

02:20:55.446 --> 02:20:58.183
HAVE TO LOOK AT. GATHERING SOME

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.651
OF THE DAY AND THERE'S NOT AS

02:20:59.717 --> 02:21:01.553
MUCH DATA AS THEY NEED BEFORE IF

02:21:01.619 --> 02:21:03.221
THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT REPORT

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:04.055
THEN THEY'RE GONNA WANT A BUNCH

02:21:04.122 --> 02:21:05.657
OF THESE OTHER THINGS BUT IF

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:07.058
THEY HAVE A CREDIT REPORT THAT

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:08.726
SAYS THAT THIS IS KINDA IFFY ON

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:10.228
THE CREDIT REPORT BUT BOY

02:21:10.295 --> 02:21:12.197
THEY'VE HAD A GREAT JOB FOR THE

02:21:12.263 --> 02:21:13.331
LAST TWO YEARS. THEY'RE MAKING

02:21:13.398 --> 02:21:15.066
UP FOR IT OVER HERE AND THAT

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:17.635
BALANCES IT OUT AND THAT HELPS

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:19.737
BRING THAT SECURITY TO A

02:21:19.804 --> 02:21:22.507
INDIVIDUAL LANDLORDS- THAT HAS

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:24.409
DON'T DOESN'T HAVE THE ROOM TO

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:26.911
HAVE SOMEBODY NOT PAY HALF THE

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:30.515
RENT AND THEN TAKE ANOTHER SIX

02:21:30.582 --> 02:21:33.151
MONTHS. TO EVICTING AND TRY OR

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:35.587
NOT BE ABLE TO VICTOR ALL AND

02:21:35.653 --> 02:21:37.388
JUST HAVE TO EAT IT- THEY DON'T

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:38.623
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:40.725
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT DATA THAT

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:45.730
TO ABILITY- SO- I. IT'S A TWO

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:49.100
THAT. IS NECESSARY FOR SOME. AND

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:51.169
IT'S USEFUL FOR SOME BUT IT'S

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:53.104
NOT ALWAYS RELIED ON AND I WOULD

02:21:53.171 --> 02:21:54.906
I WOULD HESITATE TO TAKE IT

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:56.841
AWAY. AND SAY. WE'RE NOT GONNA

02:21:56.908 --> 02:21:59.744
ALLOW CREDIT REPORTS- IT NO

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:02.347
MATTER WHO IT IS WHETHER IT'S A

02:22:02.413 --> 02:22:02.847
SUBSIDIES OR IT'S A NON

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:05.216
SUBSIDIZED PERSON- THOSE CREDIT

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:07.252
REPORTS ARE PART OF THE TOOLS

02:22:07.318 --> 02:22:09.220
FOR ESPECIALLY SMALLER-

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:12.223
LANDLORDS TO BE ABLE TO. ENSURE

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:15.059
THEIR SURVIVABILITY AND- AND

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:16.561
THEY DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY THEY

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:17.929
HAVE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT

02:22:17.996 --> 02:22:19.764
THIS HELPS THE I THINK THINGS

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:22.133
LIKE THIS WILL. ENCOURAGE THEM

02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:24.369
NOT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE. BECAUSE

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:25.937
THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:26.938
TOOLS THEY NEED AND SO THEY'RE

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:28.840
GOING TO GO TO THE SAFE PLACE

02:22:28.907 --> 02:22:30.541
AND THAT SAFE PLACE ISN'T ALWAYS

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:33.077
SOMEBODY HAS A SUBSIDY. AND DOES

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:35.446
SO THAT THAT WORRIES ME IN THAT

02:22:35.513 --> 02:22:38.816
RESPECT AND THE YOU KNOW THE BY

02:22:38.883 --> 02:22:40.919
MY LAST COMMENT IS. THE BIGGER

02:22:40.985 --> 02:22:42.820
PROBLEM IS WE HAVE FALLEN

02:22:42.887 --> 02:22:45.657
WOEFULLY WOEFULLY BEHIND. IN IN

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:49.494
BUILDING. HOMES IN CALIFORNIA

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.729
WHETHER THEIR APARTMENTS

02:22:51.796 --> 02:22:53.831
TOWNHOMES SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

02:22:53.898 --> 02:22:56.267
WHATEVER AND IN THAT PROCESS IS

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:58.503
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:01.072
ADDRESS AND- WE'RE NOT

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:03.808
ADDRESSING IT IN A MANNER THAT

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:05.476
WILL SPEED DATA. OR MAKE THAT

02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:06.611
BETTER AND THAT'S WHERE OUR

02:23:06.678 --> 02:23:09.113
FOCUS IS BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:12.850
IT TO ONE PERSON HAS- YOU HAVE

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:14.052
FIVE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR AN

02:23:14.118 --> 02:23:17.522
APARTMENT INSTEAD OF FIFTY. FIVE

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:19.457
I THINK A LOT OF THESE ISSUES

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.626
KIND OF WRITE THEMSELVES IN THE

02:23:21.693 --> 02:23:23.695
MARKET IT JUST'S TO WHAT PEOPLE

02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:25.163
CAN AFFORD IN THEIR VOUCHERS CAN

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:27.865
COVER BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LESS

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:29.534
THAN A 100% EIGHT IT'S REALLY

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:31.135
DIFFICULT FOR LANDLORDS TO GET

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:32.704
BEHIND THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.005
THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENSURE

02:23:34.072 --> 02:23:35.506
THAT SOMEBODY IS FINANCIALLY

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:37.342
CAPABLE TO KEEP. KEEP THEM

02:23:37.408 --> 02:23:39.610

WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT- BUT- THIS

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:51.456
LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY NARROW-

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.858
IT'S SOMEONE WITH A VOUCHER.

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:56.694
THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO

02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:58.997
GET. THE SOME OF THE RENT OR

02:23:59.063 --> 02:24:00.365

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:12.677
DURING OPEN. THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:24:12.744 --> 02:24:13.945

SOMEONE THAT IS APPLYING LIKE

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:22.420
THE MEMBER FROM ORANGE COUNTY

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:24.022
SAID. THEY'RE NOT JUST HANDING

AND HAVE THAT VOUCHER IN HAND IT

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.984

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:56.487
. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.356

TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS RIGHT IN

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:21.579

IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE

03:07:31.506 --> 03:07:34.810

MY QUESTION CAN BE DIRECTED AT

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:45.954

03:12:59.401 --> 03:13:01.202
LITTLE HUNG UP ON THE PARKING.

03:13:03.538 --> 03:13:05.473
THAT THAT PROBLEM. YOU SAID YOU

03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:07.943
HAD EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS

03:13:08.009 --> 03:13:09.377
CORRECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT-

03:13:09.444 --> 03:13:11.546
THAT WAS IN THAT UP BUT- WELL

03:13:11.613 --> 03:13:14.916
THEN SHECAN COME UP TO. DO YOU

03:13:14.983 --> 03:13:16.818
ALAUSA QUESTION NOW SO YOU CAN

03:13:16.885 --> 03:13:19.521
CONSIDER IT. THEY ARE THERE YOU

03:13:19.587 --> 03:13:20.889
HAVE ESTIMATES OF HOW MNY OF

03:13:20.956 --> 03:13:22.891
THOSE EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS

03:13:22.958 --> 03:13:25.493
THE PEOPLE THAT INHABIT THEM OWN

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:29.097
VEHICLES. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF

03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:33.435
THAT TYPE OF DATA AVAILABLE. SO

03:13:33.501 --> 03:13:35.437
IT'S DEPENDENT ON THE POPULATION

03:13:35.503 --> 03:13:37.806
THAT WE'RE SERVING OUR FAMILY

03:13:37.872 --> 03:13:39.307
PROJECT AND SAN MATTEO IT WOULD

03:13:39.374 --> 03:13:41.543
BE TYPICAL TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY

03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:46.081
ONE TO ONE RATIO. OKAY BECAUSE

03:13:46.147 --> 03:13:47.282
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS I'VE

03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:48.917
NEVER BEEN TO ANY APARTMENT

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:51.086
COMPLEX WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE

03:13:51.152 --> 03:13:53.521
VEHICLES SO IF THERE IS A

03:13:53.588 --> 03:13:54.522
REDUCED AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT

03:13:54.589 --> 03:13:58.026
NEEDS TO BE- GIVEN TO A ARE ARE

03:13:58.093 --> 03:14:01.296
SUPPLIED FOR A PART A UNIT- AT

03:14:01.363 --> 03:14:04.399
YEAH I WOULD I WOULD. BE MORE

03:14:04.466 --> 03:14:07.869
INCLINED TO AGREE WITH THAT-

03:14:07.936 --> 03:14:09.304
YES- YOU HAVE A LOOK LIKE YOU

03:14:09.371 --> 03:14:10.638
HAVE SOMETHING AT. MY I DON'T

03:14:10.705 --> 03:14:12.874
KNOW I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:14.242
BIT THE BILL DOESN'T. CHANGE

03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:16.044
MUCH IN THE PARKING INCENTIVES

03:14:16.111 --> 03:14:17.679
OF DENSITY BONUS BILL IT DOES

03:14:17.746 --> 03:14:19.881
SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES SO THERE

03:14:19.948 --> 03:14:21.716
IS A CLEAR IS THAT CLEANS UP THE

03:14:21.783 --> 03:14:23.551
DEFINITION. OF SORT OF THE 100%

03:14:23.618 --> 03:14:25.353
AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT QUALIFY

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:27.288
FOR THE EXISTING PARKING BENEFIT

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:30.258
AND THEN IT DOES LOWER THE AGE-

03:14:30.325 --> 03:14:31.926
FOR THE SENIOR PROJECT AT SENIOR

03:14:31.993 --> 03:14:33.094
FOR DOUBLE PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT

03:14:33.161 --> 03:14:34.696
THE ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE LIKE

03:14:34.763 --> 03:14:36.464
THE LOWER PARKING MINIMUMS MUST

03:14:36.531 --> 03:14:37.766
ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL NEAR

03:14:37.832 --> 03:14:38.733
MAJOR TRANSIT OR FOR THE SENIOR

03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:40.502
PROJECTS HAVE. ALTERNATE

03:14:40.568 --> 03:14:42.904
TRANSPORTATION MODALITY IS

03:14:42.971 --> 03:14:43.938
CONNECTED TO THE PROJECT THE

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:46.674
LIKE A CARRIAGE PARA TRANSIT

03:14:46.741 --> 03:14:48.410
OPTIONS. YEAH I UNDERSTAND I

03:14:48.476 --> 03:14:50.078
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT PART OF IT

03:14:50.145 --> 03:14:51.413
BUT- SO THIS DOES NOT PROHIBIT

03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:53.248
THE IMPOSITION OF ANY VEHICLE-

03:14:53.314 --> 03:14:55.683
PARKING RESPECT OUR STANDARDS

03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:57.952
FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. THERE ARE

03:14:58.019 --> 03:15:00.889
IT'S A 100% RIGHT OR DOUBLE. IT

03:15:00.955 --> 03:15:03.191
THE- THE BILL AND THE BILL

03:15:03.258 --> 03:15:04.993
ITSELF DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT IS

03:15:05.060 --> 03:15:06.761
ALREADY IN LAW WHICH DOES THE

03:15:06.828 --> 03:15:09.264
EXISTING WHY DOES HAVE- NO

03:15:09.330 --> 03:15:11.099
PARKING MINIMUMS FOR PROJECTS

03:15:11.166 --> 03:15:12.600
THAT ARE WITHIN A HALF MILE

03:15:12.667 --> 03:15:13.968
TRANSIT. SO FOR IT TWO HUNDRED

03:15:14.035 --> 03:15:15.737
UNITS IN THE DENSITY BONUS THING

03:15:15.804 --> 03:15:18.540
IS LIFTED TO UNLIMITED BASICALLY

03:15:18.606 --> 03:15:19.908
AND THEY BUILD SIX HUNDRED UNITS

03:15:19.974 --> 03:15:21.609
THEY JUST EXACERBATE THE ISSUE

03:15:21.676 --> 03:15:23.211
RIGHT THREE TIMES AS MANY.

03:15:23.278 --> 03:15:25.380
VEHICLE PROBLEM IS WHAT I'M

03:15:25.447 --> 03:15:27.282
GETTING AT WE NEED SOME PARKING.

03:15:27.348 --> 03:15:29.317
BECAUSE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY

03:15:29.384 --> 03:15:32.187
DO PARK. AND IT'S ALL OVER THE

03:15:32.253 --> 03:15:32.954
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT'S ALL OVER

03:15:33.021 --> 03:15:34.823
THE STREETS AND WHEN THE STREETS

03:15:34.889 --> 03:15:36.424
ARE FILLED WITH CARS. THEN

03:15:36.491 --> 03:15:37.859
THAT'S A SAFETY ISSUE FOR KIDS

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:39.594
THERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE

03:15:39.661 --> 03:15:43.031
CROSSING THE STREETS- SO IF THE

03:15:43.098 --> 03:15:44.799
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ARE ARE

03:15:44.866 --> 03:15:46.334
VERY WELL. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE

03:15:46.401 --> 03:15:47.769
TRYING TO GET TO THE HEART OF

03:15:47.836 --> 03:15:49.604
THE PROBLEM BUT- SOMETIMES WE GO

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:51.573
A LITTLE TOO FAR AND WHEN WE GO

03:15:51.639 --> 03:15:54.275
THAT FAR. WE CREATE MORE

03:15:54.342 --> 03:15:56.511
PROBLEMS THAN THAT THEN- WE ARE

03:15:56.578 --> 03:15:59.481
TRYING TO- ADDRESS SO.

03:15:59.547 --> 03:16:01.149
UNDERSTOOD MATT MASSIVE AMOUNT

03:16:01.216 --> 03:16:04.119
YOU CAN SAY ONE MORE THING. I'M

03:16:04.185 --> 03:16:06.754
OFTEN- SO I THINK ALSO KIND OF I

03:16:06.821 --> 03:16:07.922
HEAR I HEAR YOUR CONCERN AND I

03:16:07.989 --> 03:16:09.858
THINK FREQUENTLY WHERE MIGHT BE

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:11.593
MORE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN

03:16:11.659 --> 03:16:13.161
THERE'S A PARKING MAXIMUM THAT

03:16:13.228 --> 03:16:14.929
SAT RIGHT WHICH WOULD PROHIBITA

03:16:14.996 --> 03:16:16.431
DEVELOPER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:16:16.498 --> 03:16:18.299
FROM GOING BEYOND THE MINIMUM.

03:16:18.366 --> 03:16:20.935
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF AND OF

03:16:21.002 --> 03:16:22.203
NEVADA WANTS TO PROVIDE SOME

03:16:22.270 --> 03:16:23.571
EXAMPLES OF HOW FREQUENTLY DID

03:16:23.638 --> 03:16:24.873
THE DEVELOPER DID EVEN DESPITE

03:16:24.939 --> 03:16:26.841
THAN THAT. THE BILL THIS IS THE

03:16:26.908 --> 03:16:28.510
EXISTING LAW MIGHT SAVE AND

03:16:28.576 --> 03:16:30.211
THERE ARE NO PARKING MINIMUMS.

03:16:30.278 --> 03:16:31.646
FREQUENTLY A DEVELOPER WILL

03:16:31.713 --> 03:16:33.848
STILL PROVIDE FAR AND ABOVE THAT

03:16:33.915 --> 03:16:35.950
MINIMUM BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE

03:16:36.017 --> 03:16:37.352
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNITY

03:16:37.418 --> 03:16:38.653
WHAT THEY KNOW THAT THE

03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:39.888
COMMUNITY NEEDS IN ORDER FOR THE

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:41.823
PROJECT TO BE APPROVED. SINCE

03:16:41.890 --> 03:16:43.258
DENSITY BONUS DOESN'T SORT OF

03:16:43.324 --> 03:16:44.592
STREAMLINED ACTUAL APPROVAL

03:16:44.659 --> 03:16:46.127
PROCESS IN THE PROJECT STILL HAS

03:16:46.194 --> 03:16:48.096
TO BE APPROVED. IF THEY GO TOO

03:16:48.163 --> 03:16:50.298
FAR. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE GONNA

03:16:50.365 --> 03:16:52.133
HAVE OTHER CHALLENGES SO I DON'T

03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:53.701

THANK YOU- SO IN PRACTICE IN THE

03:16:58.306 --> 03:16:59.607
ANSWER THAT I GAVE PREVIOUSLY

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:03.278
THE ONE TO ONE PARKING RATIO.

03:17:03.344 --> 03:17:04.979
THIS PRETTY COMMUNITY A MIX OF

03:17:05.046 --> 03:17:06.381
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SO THE

03:17:06.447 --> 03:17:07.649
DENSITY BONUS THEY DID

03:17:07.715 --> 03:17:09.684
ADDITIONAL SIXTY ONE UNITS THAT

03:17:09.751 --> 03:17:11.119
WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD. DID NOT

03:17:11.186 --> 03:17:12.987
HAVE PARKING BUT THE ORIGINAL

03:17:13.054 --> 03:17:16.291
UNITS DID. AND IT IS DONE IN AN

03:17:16.357 --> 03:17:17.792
AREA WHERE THE CITY HAS AN

03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:19.594
ADJACENT GARAGE SO WE WERE ABLE

03:17:19.661 --> 03:17:20.795
TO KIND OF LOOK AT OTHER

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:23.398
RESOURCES WHERE WE CAN DO SOME

03:17:23.464 --> 03:17:24.632
SHARED PARKING. AND THEN THAT

03:17:24.699 --> 03:17:27.669
THE NEW UNITS ARE FOR PRIMARILY

03:17:27.735 --> 03:17:28.770
. EITHER PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:17:28.836 --> 03:17:32.507
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR-

03:17:32.574 --> 03:17:34.876
THE CITY OF SAN MATTEO HAS MANY

03:17:34.943 --> 03:17:37.078
. ADULT CHILDREN WHO HAVE AN

03:17:37.145 --> 03:17:38.646
INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL

03:17:38.713 --> 03:17:40.215
DISABILITIES WHO TYPICALLY DON'T

03:17:40.281 --> 03:17:41.950
DRIVE IT THAT IT'S TYPICAL THAT

03:17:42.016 --> 03:17:43.851
THEY'D NEED ZERO CARS ASSOCIATED

03:17:43.918 --> 03:17:45.720
BUT THEY DO HAVE AVERY HIGH

03:17:45.787 --> 03:17:47.255
DEMAND FOR THAT SO BY A LAYERING

03:17:47.322 --> 03:17:48.823
IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT

03:17:48.890 --> 03:17:52.026
HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS- YOU CAN

03:17:52.093 --> 03:17:52.827
CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE

03:17:52.894 --> 03:17:54.329
SUSTAINABLE THANK YOU. I KNOW

03:17:54.395 --> 03:17:57.065
DEVELOPER ONCE TOLD ME THAT YOU

03:17:57.131 --> 03:18:00.101
CAN'T RENT OUT A PARKING LOT. SO

03:18:00.168 --> 03:18:01.903
SO YEP PARKING LOTS ARE NOT.

03:18:01.970 --> 03:18:05.106
CONDUCIVE TO A- A PROFITABILITY

03:18:05.173 --> 03:18:06.541
IN FACT THEY'RE ONE OF THE

03:18:06.608 --> 03:18:08.543
DRAINS ON BEING ABLE TO BUILD.

03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:10.078
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A

03:18:10.144 --> 03:18:12.580
NEED ANALYSTS IF IN ESPECIALLY

03:18:12.647 --> 03:18:14.649
IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE DRIVE.

MOST OF THEM HAVE CARDS AND SO

03:18:23.124 --> 03:18:23.992
WE NEED TO MAKE THAT

03:18:24.058 --> 03:18:26.628
ACCOMMODATION- AND THAT MAKES IT

03:18:26.694 --> 03:18:29.130

BILL OVER THE FINISH LINE THAT

03:19:59.921 --> 03:20:02.156
BILLS A LANDMARK BILL IN THAT IT

03:20:02.223 --> 03:20:02.790
GAVE EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS

03:20:02.857 --> 03:20:03.925

SERIES OF EVICTIONS HAVE

03:20:08.863 --> 03:20:09.864
OCCURRED THAT ARE CLEARLY

03:20:09.931 --> 03:20:11.799
OUTSIDE THE INTENT OF THE

NEGOTIATION AND IN THE DEAL WE

03:20:18.906 --> 03:20:20.375
ENUMERATED A NUMBER OF

03:20:20.441 --> 03:20:21.376
JUSTIFIABLE CAUSES FOR

03:20:21.442 --> 03:20:23.211
TERMINATION. OF A RENTER'S

03:20:23.277 --> 03:20:26.047
TENANCY THOSE INCLUDED AT FAULTS

03:20:26.114 --> 03:20:27.915
CAUSES FOR THINGS LIKE CRIMINAL

03:20:27.982 --> 03:20:29.450
ACTIVITY ON THE PROPERTY. IT

03:20:29.517 --> 03:20:31.886
ALSO INCLUDED NO FAULT CAUSES

03:20:31.953 --> 03:20:33.121
WHEN THE TEN IT DID NOTHING

03:20:33.187 --> 03:20:34.655
WRONG BUT THE PROPERTY OWNER

03:20:34.722 --> 03:20:35.857
WANTED TO EXERT THEIR PROPERTY

03:20:35.923 --> 03:20:38.426
RIGHTS- AND REALLY THREE MAIN

03:20:38.493 --> 03:20:39.627
INSTANCES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:20:39.694 --> 03:20:42.230
HERE ONE WAS- THE MOVER WANTING

03:20:42.296 --> 03:20:44.365
TO. MOVE THEMSELVES OR A FAMILY

03:20:44.432 --> 03:20:46.834
MEMBER INTO THE UNIT- THE SECOND

03:20:46.901 --> 03:20:48.403
IS WANTING TO SUBSTANTIALLY

03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:50.104
REHABILITATE THE UNIT IN A WAY

03:20:50.171 --> 03:20:51.873
THAT MADE IT TEMPORARILY.

03:20:51.939 --> 03:20:53.241
UNINHABITABLE AND THE THIRD IS

03:20:53.307 --> 03:20:55.643
WANTING TO TAKE THE UNIT OFF THE

03:20:55.710 --> 03:20:56.744
RENTAL MARKET. WHILE THESE NO

03:20:56.811 --> 03:20:59.514
FAULT CAUSES BURKE READ TO AS

03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:00.114
REASONABLE. WHAT WE'VE BEEN

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:02.750
SEEING TO ON THE GROUNDS ON THE

03:21:02.817 --> 03:21:04.285
GROUND AS PROPERTY OWNERS.

03:21:04.352 --> 03:21:05.219
EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES BY

03:21:05.286 --> 03:21:06.988
TERMINATING TENDENCIES FOR THE

03:21:07.054 --> 03:21:09.157
CAUSES I JUST LISTED BUT NEVER

03:21:09.223 --> 03:21:09.957
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH

03:21:10.024 --> 03:21:12.226
THE ACTION. THAT IS THEY GET THE

03:21:12.293 --> 03:21:13.694
TENTATIVE ACTED BUT THEY DON'T

03:21:13.761 --> 03:21:15.596
ACTUALLY THEN MOVE IN OR IF THEY

03:21:15.663 --> 03:21:17.398
MOVE IN ITS FOR. A DAY A WEEK

03:21:17.465 --> 03:21:18.766
SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE- THEY

03:21:18.833 --> 03:21:21.335
THEY THAT THERE'S A SENTIMENT

03:21:21.402 --> 03:21:21.936
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:21:22.003 --> 03:21:23.704
REHABILITATE THE UNIT BUT IT'S

03:21:23.771 --> 03:21:24.105
NOT A SUBSTANTIVE

03:21:24.172 --> 03:21:25.606
REHABILITATION- OR THEY SAY

03:21:25.673 --> 03:21:27.074
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THAT RENTAL

03:21:27.141 --> 03:21:28.709
UNIT OFF THE MARKET BUT THEN

03:21:28.776 --> 03:21:30.511
WEEKS LATER. THEY MOVE MORE

03:21:30.578 --> 03:21:31.712
TENANTS IN. SO WE NEED TO PUT

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:33.181
MORE PARAMETERS AROUND THESE

03:21:33.247 --> 03:21:34.048
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WERE NOT

03:21:34.115 --> 03:21:35.750
REALLY DEFINED IS CLEARLY IN THE

03:21:35.817 --> 03:21:37.018
ORIGINAL BILL AND I WON ALSO SAY

03:21:37.084 --> 03:21:38.653
WE'RE KEEPING THE CORE TENETS OF

03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:40.621
THE BILL AND WE HAD VERY GOOD

03:21:40.688 --> 03:21:41.956
AND I WAS PART OF THEM.

03:21:42.023 --> 03:21:42.924

03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.925
COMMUNITIES WELL AS DEPARTMENT

03:21:43.991 --> 03:21:46.060
CESSATION AND THE REALTORS- BUT

03:21:46.127 --> 03:21:47.562
AT THROUGH THE COURSE OF TIME WE

03:21:47.628 --> 03:21:48.663
REALIZE THERE ARE THINGS THAT

03:21:48.729 --> 03:21:50.765
NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:21:50.832 --> 03:21:52.099
SPECIFIED- IN THE COURSE OF THAT

03:21:52.166 --> 03:21:54.535
LANDMARK DEAL THAT WE CREATED

03:21:54.602 --> 03:21:55.803
AND THAT IS THE GOAL AND INTENT

03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:58.406
OF THIS BILL. SO THAT'S THE GOAL

03:21:58.473 --> 03:21:59.740
IS TO REALLY- HELP DEFINE IN

03:21:59.807 --> 03:22:02.243
MORE SPECIFICITY- A STRONGER

03:22:02.310 --> 03:22:03.578

03:22:54.529 --> 03:22:55.329
LOOPHOLES IN THE TENANT

03:22:55.396 --> 03:22:56.597
PROTECTION ACT THAT HAVE

03:22:56.664 --> 03:22:58.399
RESULTED IN OUR CLIENTS LOSING

THEIR HOMES DESPITE THESE NEW

03:23:01.569 --> 03:23:02.570
AND IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS IN THE

03:23:02.637 --> 03:23:04.272
STATE. ONE SUCH A LOOPHOLE IS

03:23:04.338 --> 03:23:05.740
WHEN A LANDLORD SERVED A NOTICE

03:23:05.806 --> 03:23:07.575
OF TERMINATION STATING A FAMILY

03:23:07.642 --> 03:23:09.777
MEMBER INTENDS TO MOVE IN. RIGHT

03:23:09.844 --> 03:23:11.312
NOW THE ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE

03:23:11.379 --> 03:23:12.647
LANDLORDS TO PROVIDE ANY

03:23:12.713 --> 03:23:14.115
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WILL MOVE

03:23:14.181 --> 03:23:15.850
IN AND HOW LONG THE FAMILY

03:23:15.917 --> 03:23:17.618
MEMBER WILL LIVE IN. THE RENTAL

03:23:17.685 --> 03:23:20.121
HOME. THE ACT ALSO DOES NOT

03:23:20.187 --> 03:23:21.789
REQUIRE THE FAMILY MEMBER TO

03:23:21.856 --> 03:23:23.958
LIVE IN THE RENTAL HOME FOR ANY

03:23:24.025 --> 03:23:25.726
SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THIS

03:23:25.793 --> 03:23:27.395
LEADS TENANTS IN THE IMPOSSIBLE

03:23:27.461 --> 03:23:29.063
SITUATION OF TRYING TO DETERMINE

03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:31.265
IF THEY ALLEGE REASON IS REAL OR

03:23:31.332 --> 03:23:33.301
A PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER REASON.

03:23:33.367 --> 03:23:35.102
TENANTS HAVE NO WAY TO CHALLENGE

03:23:35.169 --> 03:23:37.138
THE REASON THE LANDLORD ALLEGES

03:23:37.204 --> 03:23:39.273
WITHOUT RISKING AN INFECTION. A

03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.275
JUDGMENT AND A MONEY JUDGMENT

03:23:41.342 --> 03:23:43.277
WHICH HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES

03:23:43.344 --> 03:23:44.512
FOR TENANTS AND MAKES IT MUCH

03:23:44.579 --> 03:23:47.214
MORE DIFFICULT IF NOT POSSIBLE

03:23:47.281 --> 03:23:48.849
TO RENT NEW HOUSING. WE HAVE

03:23:48.916 --> 03:23:50.318
SEEN CASES WHERE THE TERMINATION

03:23:50.384 --> 03:23:51.986
WAS BASED ON THE ALLEGATION THAT

03:23:52.053 --> 03:23:53.588
THE OWNER WAS GOING TO MOVE IN

03:23:53.654 --> 03:23:55.356
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES STRONGLY

03:23:55.423 --> 03:23:57.458
SUGGESTED THE OWNER NEVER DID

03:23:57.525 --> 03:23:58.960
SO. IN ONE CASE OUR CLIENT LIVED

03:23:59.026 --> 03:24:00.461
IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH

03:24:00.528 --> 03:24:02.430

MEMBER HAD ACTIVE REAL ESTATE

03:24:16.544 --> 03:24:18.145

03:24:20.247 --> 03:24:22.049
OUR CLIENT MOVED OUT OF THE

03:30:34.054 --> 03:30:35.789
BY OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

03:30:35.856 --> 03:30:37.524
TENANTS AND LABOR GROUPS.

03:30:37.591 --> 03:30:38.959
ORGANIZATION DID COME TO THE

03:30:39.026 --> 03:30:41.161
TABLE AND WE STRUCK SOME BALANCE

03:30:41.228 --> 03:30:43.430
IN THE BILL THAT WAS HISTORIC

03:30:43.497 --> 03:30:44.398
FOR A RENTAL PROPERTY

03:30:44.465 --> 03:30:46.767
ORGANIZATION TO TALK ABOUT RENT

03:30:46.834 --> 03:30:48.235
CAPS AND JUST CAUSE EVICTION

03:30:48.302 --> 03:30:49.670
WHAT WE DIDN'T DO OR WHAT THE

03:30:49.737 --> 03:30:52.673
BILL DID DO IS LEFT. A BASS LINE

03:30:52.740 --> 03:30:55.142
IN PLACE RELATING TO- JUST

03:30:55.209 --> 03:30:56.910
BECAUSE IT LEFT TO LOCAL

03:30:56.977 --> 03:30:58.445
GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO DO

03:30:58.512 --> 03:31:00.714
WHATEVER ELSE THEY WANTED TO ADD

03:31:00.781 --> 03:31:02.750
AND THEY ARE DOING THAT TODAY.

03:31:02.816 --> 03:31:06.320
AS YOU KNOW AS SOON AS- AB

03:31:06.387 --> 03:31:06.920
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO PASSED THE

03:31:06.987 --> 03:31:09.423
PANDEMIC HIT THIS BILL HAS NOT

03:31:09.490 --> 03:31:11.859
TAKEN FULL EFFECT- IF WE'VE SEEN

03:31:11.925 --> 03:31:14.695
SOME OF THESE CHANGES- AT LEAST.

03:31:14.762 --> 03:31:17.231
BY WAY OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:18.465
LOCAL LEVEL- HONESTLY WE HAVE

03:31:18.532 --> 03:31:20.434
NOT HEARD OF SOME OF THESE VOTE

03:31:20.501 --> 03:31:22.069
THE CHANGES THAT THEY'RE MAKING

03:31:22.136 --> 03:31:24.338
THOUGH GO BEYOND FOURTEEN EIGHTY

03:31:24.405 --> 03:31:25.706
TWO YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR MOTHER

03:31:25.773 --> 03:31:27.808
IN NEXT DOOR IF YOU ALREADY LIVE

03:31:27.875 --> 03:31:28.675
THERE YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR

03:31:28.742 --> 03:31:29.943
STUDENT INTO A HOUSE. IF THEY

03:31:30.010 --> 03:31:31.912
WON'T LIVE THERE FOR AT LEAST

03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:32.946
THREE YEARS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:31:33.013 --> 03:31:35.382
COLLEGE AND THEY WOULD MOVE OUT

03:31:35.449 --> 03:31:36.016
AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME

03:31:36.083 --> 03:31:37.885
SO THIS BILL DOES MORE THAN JUST

03:31:37.951 --> 03:31:38.852
CLOSE WHAT ARE PERCEIVED

03:31:38.919 --> 03:31:41.789
LOOPHOLES. WE DON'T THINK IT'S

03:31:41.855 --> 03:31:44.124
IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE

03:31:44.191 --> 03:31:45.859
OF THE PANDEMIC TENANTS SHOULD

03:31:45.926 --> 03:31:47.261
NOT HAVE BEEN MOVED OUT ANYWAY

03:31:47.327 --> 03:31:50.397
WE HAD PROTECTIONS IN PLACE- SO

03:31:50.464 --> 03:31:51.031
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT

03:31:51.098 --> 03:31:52.499
WAYS TO AFFECT THAT- SO WHAT

03:31:52.566 --> 03:31:55.836
THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR

03:31:55.903 --> 03:31:57.137

03:33:09.409 --> 03:33:11.845
SUBSTANCE HERE- AND YOU KNOW

03:33:11.912 --> 03:33:13.247
FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE ON

03:33:13.313 --> 03:33:15.849
IBM. YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM FROM

03:33:15.916 --> 03:33:17.117
THE AUTHOR AND FROM THE

03:33:17.184 --> 03:33:18.418
WITNESSES ABOUT HOW CAREFULLY

03:33:18.485 --> 03:33:19.820
NEGOTIATED FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO.

03:33:19.887 --> 03:33:21.021
WELL AS I THINK YOU DESCRIBED A

03:33:21.088 --> 03:33:23.323
MADAM CHAIR IS A LANDMARK DEAL-

03:33:23.390 --> 03:33:23.991
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

03:33:24.057 --> 03:33:25.659
CHARACTERIZATION THE- OPPOSITION

03:33:25.726 --> 03:33:27.060
WITNESS SAID THAT THEIR HISTORIC

03:33:27.127 --> 03:33:29.997
COMPROMISES MADE BY THE- BY BY.

03:33:30.063 --> 03:33:31.064
LANDLORDS I WOULD AGREE WITH

03:33:31.131 --> 03:33:32.766
THAT I WAS FRANKLY SHOCKED WHEN

03:33:32.833 --> 03:33:35.002
THEY AGREED TO- TO GO NUDE

03:33:35.068 --> 03:33:37.437
NEUTRON THAT BELL. AND WHAT'S

03:33:37.504 --> 03:33:38.705
GIVING ME PAUSE HERE IS IT FEELS

03:33:38.772 --> 03:33:41.208
LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK AND

03:33:41.275 --> 03:33:41.708
CHANGING THE TERMS OF A

03:33:41.775 --> 03:33:43.644
CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED DEAL- IN A

03:33:43.710 --> 03:33:45.379
WAY THAT I'M NOT SHORT. IS

03:33:45.445 --> 03:33:47.347
WARRANTED AND WHEN PEOPLE COME

03:33:47.414 --> 03:33:48.782
TO THE TABLE IN GOOD FAITH IN

03:33:48.849 --> 03:33:50.617
NEGOTIATING GET TO A PLACE I

03:33:50.684 --> 03:33:51.718
THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY

03:33:51.785 --> 03:33:53.053
IMPORTANT BILL. FOR ANY HISTORIC

03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:55.255
FOR THE STATE AND DID A LOT OF

03:33:55.322 --> 03:33:56.823
GOOD THINGS AND THEN IT FEELS

03:33:56.890 --> 03:33:58.625
LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK. AND MAYBE

03:33:58.692 --> 03:34:00.060
IN SOME WAYS PUNISHING THOSE WHO

03:34:00.127 --> 03:34:00.894
MADE CONCESSIONS TO- TO COME TO

03:34:00.961 --> 03:34:02.996
THE TABLE NINE I AM ALSO

03:34:03.063 --> 03:34:03.964
STRUGGLING. ON THE SUBSTANCE

03:34:04.031 --> 03:34:05.599
HERE. AM I THINK AND MR GUSTER

03:34:05.666 --> 03:34:07.568
DESCRIBED THIS AS AN ISSUE OF

03:34:07.634 --> 03:34:09.469
PROOF- AS I LOOK AT THE DETAILS

03:34:09.536 --> 03:34:11.205
IT GOES FAR BEYOND THAT. RIGHT I

03:34:11.271 --> 03:34:12.005
MEAN WE'RE LOKING HERE WE'RE

03:34:12.072 --> 03:34:14.007
SAYING. I'M IN OWNER WOULD BE

03:34:14.074 --> 03:34:15.676
REQUIRED TO MOVE IN WITH NINETY

03:34:15.742 --> 03:34:17.678
DAYS AND STAY FOR AT LEAST THREE

03:34:17.744 --> 03:34:19.613
YEARS I CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO

03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:20.981
OF SOMEONE IN MY DISTRICT. WHO

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:22.616
OWNS A DUPLEX WITH THAT THEY

03:34:22.683 --> 03:34:23.784
LIVE IN SOMEONE ELSE LIVES

03:34:23.850 --> 03:34:24.985
UPSTAIRS THEY HAVE A- CHILD

03:34:25.052 --> 03:34:26.887
COMING BACK HOME ONCE TO GET IT

03:34:26.954 --> 03:34:28.622
TO YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE CAL

03:34:28.689 --> 03:34:29.656
STATE NORTHRIDGE. THEY COULD

03:34:29.723 --> 03:34:31.091
EVEN MOVE THEIR CHILD BACK INTO

03:34:31.158 --> 03:34:32.192
THEIR UNIT. OR OR THAT HAVE TO

03:34:32.259 --> 03:34:33.994
NOT RENT A PLACE FOR YOUR KEEP

03:34:34.061 --> 03:34:35.929
THEM THERE EVEN IF THEIR CHILD

03:34:35.996 --> 03:34:36.863
WHEN GOT AT. A JOB IN ANOTHER

03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:40.234
PLACE SO THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ME

03:34:40.300 --> 03:34:41.335
LIKE AN ISSUE OF PROOF THIS

03:34:41.401 --> 03:34:42.002
SEEMS TO BE CHANGING.

03:34:42.069 --> 03:34:43.003
SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE DEAL

03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:44.338
AND SO FOUR WERE REALLY TRYING

03:34:44.404 --> 03:34:45.739
TO GET OUT HERE AS A PROOF

03:34:45.806 --> 03:34:48.141
QUESTION AT FIRST I THINK IT

03:34:48.208 --> 03:34:48.842
SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A REMEDY

03:34:48.909 --> 03:34:50.277
HEARING WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM.

03:34:50.344 --> 03:34:52.546
MR STEIN ABOUT HELD. BY LEGAL

03:34:52.613 --> 03:34:53.347
AID ORGANIZATIONS ARE

03:34:53.413 --> 03:34:54.848
SUCCESSFULLY LEAD LITIGATING

03:34:54.915 --> 03:34:56.850
THESE CASES IF WHAT WE NEED IS

03:34:56.917 --> 03:34:58.785
MORE MONEY FOR LEGAL AID. I'M A

03:34:58.852 --> 03:35:00.787
THOUSAND PERCENT- IN SUPPORT OF

03:35:00.854 --> 03:35:02.589
THAT. BUT LET'S CHANGE THE

03:35:02.656 --> 03:35:04.591
STANDARD OF PROOF BUT TO GO BACK

03:35:04.658 --> 03:35:05.892
AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE IN

03:35:05.959 --> 03:35:08.729
THE APARTMENT FOR THREE YEARS.

03:35:08.795 --> 03:35:10.264
YOU'VE GOT A MAIN GET PERMITS OF

03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:13.066
YOU CAN DO ANY. WE NEED SEEMS TO

03:35:13.133 --> 03:35:13.700
ME SEEMS THAT WE'RE GETTING AT.

03:35:13.767 --> 03:35:14.901
WE'RE GETTING AT THE FUNDAMENTAL

03:35:14.968 --> 03:35:16.169
ARCHITECTURE THAT DEAL. IN A

03:35:16.236 --> 03:35:18.071
VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY- AND

03:35:18.138 --> 03:35:19.439
THEN THE OTHER THING I'D ASK FOR

03:35:19.506 --> 03:35:20.707
JUST- IN LOOKING IN THE- THE

03:35:20.774 --> 03:35:22.542
ANALYSIS HERE THERE WAS. IT SAID

03:35:22.609 --> 03:35:23.977
THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THE

03:35:24.044 --> 03:35:25.746
PROPERTY OWNERS ARE DOING THIS.

03:35:25.812 --> 03:35:27.281
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT GIVEN

03:35:27.347 --> 03:35:28.048
WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE

03:35:28.115 --> 03:35:29.549
OPPOSITION THAT BECAUSE OF THE

03:35:29.616 --> 03:35:30.817
PANDEMIC PEOPLE SHOULD BE MOVED

03:35:30.884 --> 03:35:31.985
OUT ANYWAY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS

03:35:32.052 --> 03:35:34.021
IF THERE'S ANY DATA OR RESEARCH.

03:35:34.087 --> 03:35:35.455
OR ANY METRICS OR STATISTICS

03:35:35.522 --> 03:35:38.325
THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ABOUT HOW

03:35:38.392 --> 03:35:38.825
FREQUENTLY THIS HAS BEEN

03:35:38.892 --> 03:35:39.726
HAPPENING. IF WE HAD A RENTAL

03:35:39.793 --> 03:35:41.662
REGISTRY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:35:41.728 --> 03:35:47.067
ANSWER THAT QUESTION- SO I'LL

03:35:47.134 --> 03:35:48.669
LET SOMEONE ELSE ADDRESS THAT

03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:50.504
THE DATA AROUND WHO'S WHO'S SORT

03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:52.172
OF DEALING DAY IN AND DAY OUT

03:35:52.239 --> 03:35:53.206
WITH FOLKS ARE HAVING THIS

03:35:53.273 --> 03:35:55.676
EXPERIENCE- I WILL SAY YOU KNOW

03:35:55.742 --> 03:35:57.577
WHEN WE CAME TO TERMS WITH THE

03:35:57.644 --> 03:35:59.913
DEAL WE SAID. A NO FAULT

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:01.982
EVICTION WOULD BE. YOU KNOW AN

03:36:02.049 --> 03:36:04.051
OWNER WANTS TO MOVE IN RIGHT AND

03:36:04.117 --> 03:36:05.886
SO IF AN OWNER WANTS TO MOVE IN

03:36:05.952 --> 03:36:08.021
IS ONE DAY FARE AND THEN THEY

03:36:08.088 --> 03:36:09.790
CAN PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET. I

03:36:09.856 --> 03:36:11.658
GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT

03:36:11.725 --> 03:36:13.627
IS TO ME THAT'S A DEAL POINT

03:36:13.694 --> 03:36:15.228
THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN NEGOTIATED

03:36:15.295 --> 03:36:16.596
I I'D HAVE TO EXPECTED. CA WANT

03:36:16.663 --> 03:36:18.732
TO AGREE TO THAT IF YOU SAID

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:19.800
THEY HAVE TO LIVE FORTHREE

03:36:19.866 --> 03:36:20.901
YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

03:36:20.967 --> 03:36:22.736
THEY'RE TELLING US RIGHT NOW SO

03:36:22.803 --> 03:36:24.738
IT DOESN'T TO ME THAT FEELS LIKE

03:36:24.805 --> 03:36:25.605
AN IMPORTANT DEAL POINT. THAT

03:36:25.672 --> 03:36:26.873
WE'RE GOING BACK AND REWRITING

03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:29.042
AFTER THE FACT WHAT I THINK I

03:36:29.109 --> 03:36:29.743
THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE DIDN'T

03:36:29.810 --> 03:36:31.411
ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE WHAT MOVING

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:32.679
MEANT RIGHT AND THAT'S PART OF

03:36:32.746 --> 03:36:33.847
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE WE'VE- THE

03:36:33.914 --> 03:36:35.649
BILL. ONCE THE LAW HAS BEEN

03:36:35.716 --> 03:36:37.150
IMPLEMENTED WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

03:36:37.217 --> 03:36:38.852
IS. IT IS ESSENTIALLY BEEN USED

03:36:38.919 --> 03:36:40.020
AS A LOOPHOLE TO EVICT PEOPLE

03:36:40.087 --> 03:36:41.788
AND THEN TO BUMP UP THE RENT AND

03:36:41.855 --> 03:36:43.690
BRING INTENDED SAID AND SO I

03:36:43.757 --> 03:36:44.991
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE IT'S A

03:36:45.058 --> 03:36:47.060
LITTLE BIT. IN MY OPINION ADDING

03:36:47.127 --> 03:36:47.994
MORE DEFINITION TO A PRE

03:36:48.061 --> 03:36:48.962
EXISTING DEAL SO MAYBE THREE

03:36:49.029 --> 03:36:50.764
YEARS ISN'T FAIR. WE SHOULD GO

03:36:50.831 --> 03:36:51.932
SHAPE THAT WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD

03:36:51.998 --> 03:36:54.434
SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND TALK

03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:56.002
ABOUT WHAT WE THINK COULD WORK

03:36:56.069 --> 03:36:56.870
AND I WELCOME THOSE

03:36:56.937 --> 03:36:57.371
CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW

03:36:57.437 --> 03:36:58.572
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE DAY AND

03:36:58.638 --> 03:36:59.906
THREE YEARS MAYBE IS WHERE WE

03:36:59.973 --> 03:37:01.875
WOULD LAND ON THAT AND I THINK

03:37:01.942 --> 03:37:02.809
THAT'S MY HOPE IS THAT THE

03:37:02.876 --> 03:37:04.745
CONVERSATION CAN KEEP GOING. AND

03:37:04.811 --> 03:37:06.546
WE CAN SAY WHAT DOES SEEM FAIR

03:37:06.613 --> 03:37:07.314
FROM YOUR GUISES PERSPECTIVE.

03:37:07.381 --> 03:37:09.282
YOU KNOW TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:09.950
AROUND. YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT-

03:37:10.016 --> 03:37:11.718
IF AN OWNER IS TRULY MOVING IN

03:37:11.785 --> 03:37:13.220
THEN THEY'RE REALLY MOVING IN.

03:37:13.286 --> 03:37:14.988
AYE AYE AYE CHAU I SUPER

03:37:15.055 --> 03:37:15.722
APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I GUESS

03:37:15.789 --> 03:37:17.724
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. IT EEMS TO

03:37:17.791 --> 03:37:19.860
ME LIKE THE DEAL POINT WISE WILL

03:37:19.926 --> 03:37:21.661
LEAVE THIS QUESTION UP TO LOCAL

03:37:21.728 --> 03:37:22.763
JURISDICTIONS SO IT SEEMS LIKE

03:37:22.829 --> 03:37:23.830
THAT PART OF IT WAS NEGOTIATED.

03:37:23.897 --> 03:37:26.566
AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY SECONDLY

03:37:26.633 --> 03:37:27.401
FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE.

03:37:27.467 --> 03:37:29.035
GIVEN THE WAY THAT FOLKS STRETCH

03:37:29.102 --> 03:37:30.470
TO CREATE CRAFTER THIS IS START

03:37:30.537 --> 03:37:31.872
DEAL. I WOULD I WOULD THINK

03:37:31.938 --> 03:37:33.640
THAT. THE RESPONSE WOULD BE TO

03:37:33.707 --> 03:37:36.009
GO TO THEM FIRST AND SAY HEY. WE

03:37:36.076 --> 03:37:36.676
THINK THERE'S A HANDFUL OF

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:37.878
UNSCRUPULOUS FOLKS OUT THERE AND

03:37:37.944 --> 03:37:39.846
I WAS MOVED BY MISTIMES

03:37:39.913 --> 03:37:40.747
TESTIMONY I THINK IT SOUNDED

03:37:40.814 --> 03:37:42.015
LIKE. REAL SCUMBAGS OUT THERE.

03:37:42.082 --> 03:37:44.084
CAN WE WORK WITH YOU ON A- ON A

03:37:44.151 --> 03:37:46.153
FIX TO ADDRESS PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:37:46.219 --> 03:37:47.053
CIRCUMVENTING AS- AND- IT AND I

03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:48.922
WISH THAT THAT HAD HAPPENED

03:37:48.989 --> 03:37:49.956
FIRST RATHER THAN. JUST COMING

03:37:50.023 --> 03:37:50.724
HERE AND SAYING. WE'RE GONNA

03:37:50.791 --> 03:37:52.826
ROUTE GO BACK. CHANGE THE TERMS

03:37:52.893 --> 03:37:54.761
HERE AND ADD THIS THREE YEAR

03:37:54.828 --> 03:37:55.762
THING WHICH- TO ME THAT SOUNDS

03:37:55.829 --> 03:37:57.798
LIKE A LOT. YEAH AND I AND I

03:37:57.864 --> 03:37:59.800
ALSO AND LET. MISTER JUSTICE

03:37:59.866 --> 03:38:00.634
BECAUSE WELL- AND I THINK

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:01.902
THAT'S- PART OF THIS PROCESS

03:38:01.968 --> 03:38:03.303
RIGHT AND- AND- RESPECTFULLY THE

03:38:03.370 --> 03:38:03.970
OPPOSITION LETTER DIDN'T REALLY

03:38:04.037 --> 03:38:05.772
ALLOWED ANY OTHER. COUNTERPOINT

03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:07.774
RIGHT IT WAS. JUST SORT OF A

03:38:07.841 --> 03:38:09.176
BLANKET OPPOSITION. MY HOPE IS

03:38:09.242 --> 03:38:11.011
WE CAN CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATIONS

03:38:11.077 --> 03:38:12.145
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK

03:38:12.212 --> 03:38:13.880
THAT'S- THE- THAT'S WHAT THIS.

03:38:13.947 --> 03:38:15.449
PRODUCT POLICY PROCESS IS FOR.

03:38:15.515 --> 03:38:17.384
WE HAVE ALREADY OPENED UP

03:38:17.451 --> 03:38:18.285
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. WE DIDN'T

03:38:18.351 --> 03:38:19.553
TWENTY TWENTY. WE RENEGOTIATED

03:38:19.619 --> 03:38:22.189
SOME OF THOSE TERMS ALREADY. SO

03:38:22.255 --> 03:38:23.323
I DON'T THINK THE LANGUAGES IN

03:38:23.390 --> 03:38:25.192
SICILY SACROSANCT. I THINK WHAT

03:38:25.258 --> 03:38:27.060
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. FINE TUNE

03:38:27.127 --> 03:38:29.262
AND AS WE IMPLEMENT LAW WE HAVE

03:38:29.329 --> 03:38:30.130
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING KIND OF.

03:38:30.197 --> 03:38:32.032
WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT

03:38:32.098 --> 03:38:34.067
WORKING. AND I AND LIKE I SAID I

03:38:34.134 --> 03:38:34.935
WELCOME THE CONVERSATION AND I

03:38:35.001 --> 03:38:36.636
HOPE THAT THAT'S A PLACE WHERE

03:38:36.703 --> 03:38:39.272
WE CAN GET IF WE CAN. GET THE

03:38:39.339 --> 03:38:40.006
BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY.

03:38:40.073 --> 03:38:41.475
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT

03:38:41.541 --> 03:38:43.076
IT'S IMPORTANT. AND I ABSOLUTELY

03:38:43.143 --> 03:38:43.677
AGREE. THE PURPOSE OF STATION

03:38:43.743 --> 03:38:44.911
BUILDERS. REALLY CAME TO THE

03:38:44.978 --> 03:38:46.646
TABLE AND THAT PROCESS AND I

03:38:46.713 --> 03:38:47.714
WANT TO RESPECT. THEIR WORK IN

03:38:47.781 --> 03:38:49.282
THAT IN PERSPECTIVE DECISIONS

03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:50.984
THAT THEY MADE. AND THE FACT

03:38:51.051 --> 03:38:52.018
THAT I THINK THEY ALSO HAD TO

03:38:52.085 --> 03:38:53.153
MOVE THEIR CONSTITUENCIES

03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:55.055
CONSIDERABLY. FOR THAT AND SO

03:38:55.121 --> 03:38:55.956
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M I THINK I'VE

03:38:56.022 --> 03:38:57.023
NOTICED SOMEONE WHO WELCOMES

03:38:57.090 --> 03:38:57.958
THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS SO

03:38:58.024 --> 03:38:59.693
IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP

03:38:59.759 --> 03:39:02.195
DOING AYE AYE I APPRECIATE THEM

03:39:02.262 --> 03:39:03.630
AND IN TURN I THINK PART OF WHAT

03:39:03.697 --> 03:39:05.232
YOU'RE HEARING IT REACT TO IS

03:39:05.298 --> 03:39:06.299
THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THIS

03:39:06.366 --> 03:39:07.767
IS A PROOF ISSUE. THREE YEARS

03:39:07.834 --> 03:39:09.402
DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS A

03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:10.303
PROFESSION. THAT IS A

03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:11.771
FUNDAMENTAL DEAL POINT. AND TO

03:39:11.838 --> 03:39:13.173
HAVE IT REPRESENTED THAT WAY.

03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:14.307
IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING. NO I HEAR

03:39:14.374 --> 03:39:15.609
THAT AND I THINK- I CAN SPEAK

03:39:15.675 --> 03:39:17.544
FOR MYSELF I'M- VERY WILLING TO

03:39:17.611 --> 03:39:19.412
NEGOTIATE ON THAT. THEN IF I MAY

03:39:19.479 --> 03:39:20.046
JUST WRITTEN RESPONSE. I'M WELL

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:22.649
I WAS TRYING TO CUT MY REMARKS

03:39:22.716 --> 03:39:23.817
ON MR GABRIEL BUT I DO. I DO

03:39:23.884 --> 03:39:26.586
THINK IT IS A PROBLEM A PROOF

03:39:26.653 --> 03:39:28.388
AND RIGHT NOW WHERE WE ARE. IS

03:39:28.455 --> 03:39:29.055
AS MISS NINE ARMORED TESTIFIED.

03:39:29.122 --> 03:39:30.123
IN A SITUATION WHERE LANDLORDS

03:39:30.190 --> 03:39:32.158
CAN SAY ARE MOVING AND- AND

03:39:32.225 --> 03:39:33.493
NEVER MOVE AND IT'S A HEAD FAKE.%

03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:35.595
SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE MEASURE.

03:39:35.662 --> 03:39:36.730
THAT THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH

03:39:36.796 --> 03:39:38.064
THAT THEY ARE. IN GOOD FAITH

03:39:38.131 --> 03:39:39.833
INTENDING TO MOVE IN. WELL

03:39:39.900 --> 03:39:41.001
CERTAINLY NUMBER ONE. THEY

03:39:41.067 --> 03:39:42.836
SHOULD MOVE IT. NUMBER TWO. THEY

03:39:42.903 --> 03:39:44.304
SHOULD REMAIN IN OCCUPANCY FOR

03:39:44.371 --> 03:39:46.239
SOME AMOUNT OF TIME SO I THINK.

03:39:46.306 --> 03:39:48.241
THAT IS THREE YEARS THE RIGHT.

03:39:48.308 --> 03:39:50.210
METRIC RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ZERO.

03:39:50.277 --> 03:39:51.511
SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ZERO AND

03:39:51.578 --> 03:39:53.980
THREE YEARS. WOULD SUBSTANTIATE

03:39:54.047 --> 03:39:55.382
THAT THEIR GOOD FAITH REASON WAS

03:39:55.448 --> 03:39:57.017
IN FACT A RECENT AND THAT'S WHAT

03:39:57.083 --> 03:39:58.852
WE'RE- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING

03:39:58.919 --> 03:40:00.287
FOR. AND I THINK IF THAT'S THE

03:40:00.353 --> 03:40:02.188
POINT WE HAVE A VERY WELL

03:40:02.255 --> 03:40:03.123
DEVELOPED BODY OF LAW ON THE

03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:04.958
STATE FOR HOW WE DO PREFER RIGHT

03:40:05.025 --> 03:40:07.360
WE HAVE SHIFTING BURDENS WE HAVE

03:40:07.427 --> 03:40:08.028
DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF PROOF WE

03:40:08.094 --> 03:40:08.862
HAVE EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS.

03:40:08.929 --> 03:40:09.996
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:40:10.063 --> 03:40:11.598
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO.

03:40:11.665 --> 03:40:12.699
DIFFERENT THAN SAYING. YOU HAVE

03:40:12.766 --> 03:40:13.767
TO LIVE THERE FOR THREE YEARS.

03:40:13.833 --> 03:40:15.735
SO IF IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM OF

03:40:15.802 --> 03:40:17.637
PROOF. LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT AND

03:40:17.704 --> 03:40:19.573
COME UP AND I THINK WE COULD NOT

03:40:19.639 --> 03:40:20.740
GET OUT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES

03:40:20.807 --> 03:40:21.942
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO PROVE.

03:40:22.008 --> 03:40:23.810
THAT YOU REALLY WERE MOVING IN.

03:40:23.877 --> 03:40:26.212
AND THIS IS IN A PRE TAX BECAUSE

03:40:26.279 --> 03:40:27.747
WE DEAL WITH THAT AND A WHOLE

03:40:27.814 --> 03:40:29.316
BROAD. ARRAY OF CONTEXT. BUT TO

03:40:29.382 --> 03:40:31.017
SAY YOU HAVE TO LIVE THERE FOR

03:40:31.084 --> 03:40:32.152
THREE YEARS. THAT IS NOT A

03:40:32.218 --> 03:40:34.454
PROFESSIONAL AND NOT AND NOT

03:40:34.521 --> 03:40:37.390
REALLY FRUSTRATES ME. ACTION ON

03:40:37.457 --> 03:40:39.659
THAT BUT- HOW. HOW POST TALK TO

03:40:39.726 --> 03:40:41.294
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. HER

03:40:41.361 --> 03:40:42.762
GOOD FAITH INTENTION WAS REAL

03:40:42.829 --> 03:40:44.130
AND THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY COMING

03:40:44.197 --> 03:40:45.165
OUT OF THAT THERE WAS RELEASED

03:40:45.231 --> 03:40:47.067
ON. BUT WE DO THAT IN THE

03:40:47.133 --> 03:40:48.368
APPOINTED CONTEXT ALL THE TIME.

03:40:48.435 --> 03:40:49.769
I'M RIGHT I MEAN WHEN IT IS THIS

03:40:49.836 --> 03:40:51.805
A PRETEXT OR SOMEONE FIRED FOR

03:40:51.871 --> 03:40:53.573
DIFFERENT REASON I MEAN WE HAVE.

03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:55.875
THIS IS NOT. A UNIQUE PROBLEM TO

03:40:55.942 --> 03:40:56.876
THIS AREA OF LAW. THIS IS WHY

03:40:56.943 --> 03:40:58.111
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

03:40:58.178 --> 03:40:59.446
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH

03:40:59.512 --> 03:41:02.682
OPPONENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

03:41:02.749 --> 03:41:05.552
FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION.

03:41:05.619 --> 03:41:08.555
ANYBODY ELSE MISS KOREA. THANK

03:41:14.995 --> 03:41:17.263
WILL HAVE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS

03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:19.232
AND SENTIMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE

03:41:19.299 --> 03:41:20.834
UP IN THE VALLEY HAS ALSO

03:41:20.900 --> 03:41:23.136
EXPRESSED IN YOU AND I HAD A

03:41:23.203 --> 03:41:24.871
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IS ALL

03:41:24.938 --> 03:41:26.072
I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO THE

03:41:26.139 --> 03:41:27.974
IMPACT TO SMALL MOM AND POPS I

03:41:28.041 --> 03:41:28.775
KNOW FIRST CONVERSATION ABOUT

03:41:28.842 --> 03:41:30.944
DUPLEXES I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE

03:41:31.011 --> 03:41:33.780
IMPACT TO. A HOMEOWNER THAT HAS

03:41:33.847 --> 03:41:35.782
A FOUR PLEX- AND REALLY JUST THE

03:41:35.849 --> 03:41:37.784
IMPACT TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE IN MY

03:41:37.851 --> 03:41:39.819
COMMUNITY THE MUCH A LARGE

03:41:39.886 --> 03:41:42.789
PERCENTAGE OF HOUSING. HAS A

03:41:42.856 --> 03:41:45.392
HOME A DUPLEX AND EIGHTY YOU FOR

03:41:45.458 --> 03:41:47.193
SMALL UNITS ON THE PROPERTY

03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:48.995
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HUGE

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:50.764
APARTMENT COMPLEXES WERE TALKING

03:41:50.830 --> 03:41:54.367
ABOUT THE SMALL RESIDENTIAL. THE

03:41:54.434 --> 03:41:55.669
UNIT THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD

03:41:55.735 --> 03:41:57.971
DISCUSSIONS ON TO- R. ONE ZONING

03:41:58.038 --> 03:41:59.906
ARE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR. AND

03:41:59.973 --> 03:42:03.877
I'M I AM CONCERNED. THAT WE MIX

03:42:03.943 --> 03:42:04.978
THESE SITUATIONS ARE THESE

03:42:05.045 --> 03:42:06.813
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HUGE HOUSING

03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:10.150
COMPLEXES WITH SMALLER UNITS-

03:42:10.216 --> 03:42:11.718
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW

03:42:11.785 --> 03:42:12.952
FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY WOULD

03:42:13.019 --> 03:42:15.188
BE IMPACTED TO US WELL AND AS

03:42:15.255 --> 03:42:16.189
YOU CONTINUE TO MOVE THE

03:42:16.256 --> 03:42:18.191
CONVERSATION FORWARD- THOSE ARE

03:42:18.258 --> 03:42:19.092
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE EXPRESSED

03:42:19.159 --> 03:42:20.894
CONCERNS ABOUT. I AM HAPPY TO

03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:22.696
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY TO ENSURE

03:42:22.762 --> 03:42:24.130
THAT THE CONVERSATION FROM

03:42:24.197 --> 03:42:25.932
FORWARD. BUT IF WE DON'T GET TO

03:42:25.999 --> 03:42:27.801
A GOOD PLACE BY THE TIME THAT

03:42:27.867 --> 03:42:28.601
OBVIOUSLY THIS REACHES THE

03:42:28.668 --> 03:42:31.304
FLOOR. THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

03:42:31.371 --> 03:42:32.806
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION YEAH NO I

03:42:32.872 --> 03:42:35.442
APPRECIATE THAT. AND AGAIN I

03:42:35.508 --> 03:42:37.077
THINK THE- THE GOAL HERE IS YOU

03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:39.879
KNOW. WE MADE A DEAL THAT SAYS
