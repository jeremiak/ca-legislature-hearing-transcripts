THIS -- ARRANGEMENT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE TEMPORARY THERE'S BEEN A WORK GROUP -- THAT WE'VE BEEN -- TRYING TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THAT GROUP -- WHAT HAPPENS TODAY IS THAT COUNTIES ARE JUST NOT ABLE TO CONTROL OR ANTICIPATE THE EXPENDITURES -- FROM THE FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE THE BILLS CAN BE SUBMITTED FOR UP TO TWO YEARS AFTER THE ADOPTIONS. SO WE SUPPORT PART AND HAVE WORKED WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR TOM FAMILY SERVICES TO INSURE THAT WILL CONTINUE IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM WITH THE STATE WIDE RATE.

I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY WITH OF THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLYMAN COOLEY AND MISSY WGA TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE PRIVATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN DO IT OPTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT HOW WELFARE SYSTEMS IN THIS IN THIS STATE WHICH IS KIND OF HARD TO NAVIGATE AT TIMES -- NOT EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY. IS COMFORTABLE GOING INTO A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SO THE PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS OFFER JUST A CHOICE ANOTHER CHOICE FOR FAMILY AND I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT BUT THAT THIS IS JUST A MOMENT TO ASK YOU TO NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND WHETHER YOU'RE. IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF BY SORRY YEAH JILL JACOBS FAMILY BUILDERS BY ADOPTION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU OKAY.

CREATING ALL FAMILIES FOR OLDER YOUTH WELCOMING L. G. B. T. FAMILIES AND L. G. B. T. YOUTH ARE TO PERMANENT SAYING. SINGLE PARENTS. IN THE OTHER THING IS THAT WHAT. WE CAN WORK STATEWIDE COUNTIES TEND TO WORK IT WITHIN THEIR COUNTY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES THE MOST OF THE TIME THAT WORKS OUT WELL BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR FOR CERTAIN CHILDREN IN FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES.

THREE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOUR READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I PRESENT TO YOU AB SIX A BILL WHICH CREATES THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. INCREASING THE CAPACITY AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMING. THIS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE CAME AS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SPEAKERS AT BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THIS COMMISSION WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR TWO YEARS AT ASSESSING ALL ASPECTS OF THE VERY COMPLEX EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION STRUCTURE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH CULMINATED IN A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. THE VERY NATURE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION REQUIRES A VARIETY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS. IN MIXED MATHIS DELIVERY SYSTEM OF CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND THE INCLUSION OF A DIVERSE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WITH PARTICULAR NEEDS. A STRONG UC SYSTEM JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SEGMENT OF OUR EDUCATION CAN ONLY EXIST WITH THE STRONG GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHICH OPERATES. TO GUARANTEE OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS ARE TO YOU ACHIEVING EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND EQUITY AS INTENDED. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CAN BE THE GREATEST EQUALIZER THE CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY. TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. HERE WITH ME TO TO SPEAK MORE ON THE MATTER REPRESENTING THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER IS DIANA DOMINGUEZ. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS ISSUE I AM DIANNE ASSUMING GUYS WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER THE LARGEST NONPROFIT CHILD CARE AND FAMILY SERVICES AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA. SERVING SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND NORTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE KNOW THAT THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF A CHILD'S LIFE ARE INCREDIBLY CRUCIAL TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT. CREATING A BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL SOLIDIFY CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENTS TO OUR CHILDREN DURING THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD AND ALLOW ARE EASY EASY SYSTEM TO WORK IN THE MOST COST EFFICIENT AND PROGRAMMATIC LEE AFFECTED WAY. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS COMPLEX AND NOT ONLY OPERATES ACROSS THE MULTITUDE OF STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO PROVIDES A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. NO OTHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA FACES THIS LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE FRAGMENTATION MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS TO NAVIGATE THE SEAS SYSTEM. MY CO DR MICHAEL NECK SERVED ON THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WHICH HARD EVIDENCE OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES% AND EASY PROVIDERS GETTING LOST IN THE SYSTEM. DID YOU ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES. THE CREATION OF A BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ILLUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S DEDICATION TO ITS YOUNGEST AND MOST VULNERABLE LEARNERS. AND ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER FOR THEM. DEVELOPING A SOLID EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM CHANGES AND STRENGTHENS THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR COMMUNITIES. IT MEANS MORE CHILDREN READY FOR KINDERGARTEN AND THRIVING IN SCHOOL IT MEANS MORE PARENTS YOU CAN ENTER OR STAY IN THE WORK FORCE AND UP LIFT THEIR FAMILIES FROM POVERTY. WE NEED A BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A STRONG IS THE SYSTEM AND REALIZE ALL OF THESE BENEFITS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME UP STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. THE PERSON'S PERSONAL CLOSE HERE ON BEHALF OF A CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE SPELL.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA PRESENTING ON AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB. ONE SIXTY THREE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ALL RECENT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT POLICIES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE LACK OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND DETENTION FACILITIES FOR UNDOCUMENTED UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS WHERE CHILDREN HAVE DIED OR BEEN A. B. C.'S FALL UNDER THE CARE OF ICE. THE US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND WHILE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF REFUGEE SAID RESETTLEMENT. IT'S OUR PARA CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO SAFELY DETAIN CHILDREN. MOST RECENTLY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WENT INTO NINE FACILITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HOUSE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINORS AND COMPILED A REPORT ON THE CONDITIONS AND SET KEY RECOMMENDATIONS. A COMMON THREAD IS A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES HOUSE IN THE MOST RESPECT THE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS ALONG WITH THE LACK. OF ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND BEHAVIORAL EDUCATIONAL SUPPORTS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING FOR THESE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT A NUMBER OF THEM IN THE MEDIA. ANY OF THESE FACILITIES MUST HAVE A STATE LICENSE WHICH HAS A UNIQUE TOOL FOR US TO LEVERAGE YOUR SEPARATE FROM HOW I TOLD HER HOUSE. AND SO AB ONE SIXTY THREE AIMS TO TRY TO LEVERAGE OUR STATE LICENSE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THESE CHILDREN TO TRY TO KEEP THEM SAFE. WE KNOW THAT THEIR ROAD HERE IS TRAUMATIC OFTEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE THEY'RE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CONTINUE TO BE TRAUMATIZED THEM. INTO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME I HAVE EXPERTS WHO CAN SPEAK MORE. I TO THE NEED FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE MATTHEWS AND I SERVE AS A STAFF ATTORNEY INVESTIGATIONS UNIT I DISABILITY RATES CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS THE R. C. -- RELEVANT AB ONE SIXTY THREE DEAR SEE HAS DELVE DEEP INTO THE ISSUE PROVIDING MUCH. NEEDED SERVICES TO EMIGRATE CHILDREN. UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW WHICH PROVIDES US WITH THE BROADER STORY TAXESANY FACILITY WHERE WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SUBJECT TO ABUSE NEGLECT. MY TEAM INITIATED LAST JULY THE MONITORING OF ALL CALIFORNIA FACILITIES. THAT HOUSE CHILDREN IN THE CUSTODY OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT ALSO THERE IS -- ARE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WE TOWARD NINE FACILITIES FROM SAN DIEGO ALL THE WAY TO LOOK YOLO COUNTY SPOKE TO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO CHILDREN. AND INTERVIEWED CLINICIANS AND SOCIAL WORKERS AT THESE FACILITIES. ALL BUT ONE OF THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TWO WEEKS AGO DEAR SEE PUBLISHED HER FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS IN A SNAPSHOT PAPER ENTITLED THE DETENTION OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN A REPORT YEARS HE MADE THREE KEY FINDINGS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ALL WHICH ARE PERTINENT. TO EIGHTY ONE SIXTY THREE FIRST YOUR SEATS COVER THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HOUSE. IN -- OURS MOST RESTRICTED FACILITIES THE REASON FOR THIS OVER POPULATION IN THE MOST RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IS THAT -- OURS POLICIES DETERMINE THAT A CHILD CAN BE STEPPED UP. FROM A LESS RESTRICTIVE FACILITY. FOR EXITING SELF HARMING BEHAVIOR THIS MEANS THAT CHILDREN WAS SUICIDAL IDEATION -- AND PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITY NEEDS CAN BE PLACED IN MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS. SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY. SECOND DRC FOUND THAT -- ARE FAILS TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH ITS CARE IT'S CARE WITH APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. NONE OF THE EIGHT FACILITIES THAT ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OFFER INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATIONAL PLANS ALSO KNOWN AS IP'S. TO ANY OF THEIR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. WHEN ASKED WHETHER THERE WERE CHILDREN WITH ANY LEARNING OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AT A FACILITY ONE CLINICIAN RESPONDED HONESTLY? I DON'T KNOW. IN ITS POLICIES -- ARE ONLY PROVIDES A MINIMUM THE SIX HOURS OF EDUCATION PER WEEK TO IS IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. THESE SIX HOURS ARE MEAGER AND INADEQUATE WHEN COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA LAW THAT REQUIRES AT LEAST NINETEEN POINT TWO HOURS PER WEEK. FOR THE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN FEDERAL CUSTODY. IN THE COURSE OF OUR MONITORING CLINICIANS AND SOCIAL WORKERS EXPLAINED THAT -- OUR CHILDREN DO NOT NEED AS ROBUST EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND IMMIGRANT CHILDREN HAVE SUCH A SHORT STAY. THIS IS BOTH MISGUIDED AND NOT TRUE. MANY OF THE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND YOUR C. INTERVIEWED WERE PLACED IN THESE -- OUR FACILITIES FOR SIX MONTHS OR LONGER. THE ACTUAL CLASSROOMS THAT WE WITNESSED WHERE IT IS ORGANIZE WITH CHILDREN OF ALL AGES AND ALL EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS PLACE TOGETHER. THIRD DRC FOUNDED THAT LOWERS ASSESSMENTS AND SERVICES FALL SHORT. COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA STANDARDS WELL -- ARE DOES PROVIDE FOR LIMITED ARRAY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IT'S POLICY HAS LITTLE SPECIFICITY. AS TO BOTH THE SCOPE AND THE DEATH OF THE SERVICES. IN CONTRAST TO TITLE FIFTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS SCANTY REGULATIONS UTILIZED FOR CHILDREN IN JUVENILE DELINQUENCY PROCEEDINGS PLACE IN JUVENILE HALL. PLACE DO NOT HOLD AS MUCH MORE IT IS EVEN MORE ABBASID AWARDS AND POLICIES. ALSO CHILDREN IN STATE -- FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS -- RECEIVE FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND CARE. CURRENTLY -- OURS GUIDELINES ARE LESS SPECIFIC AND DETAILED IN CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS AND THIS RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF REGULATORY GUIDANCE. AND OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES RECEIVE BOTH THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AB ONE SIXTY THREE WITH A SYSTEM PROVIDING MORE SERVICES TO CHILDREN THAT DESPERATELY NEED PROPER ASSESSMENT. THE PORT AND TREATMENT. AB ONE SIXTY THREE CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BETTER SERVICES A BETTER ASSESSMENT. IN ALL THESE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER. AB ONE SIXTY THREE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY SUNDERLAND WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE SIXTY THREE WE'VE WATCHED WITH CONCERN AS STORIES OF MALTREATMENT CONTINUE TO SERVICE RELATED TO CILDREN IN THE CUSTODY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES DON'T HAVE FORMAL JURISDICTION HERE BUT WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF THESE CHILDREN BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. FOR THESE REASONS OR SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT TO DO WHAT WE CAN AS A STATE AND AS COUNTIES. TO CONNECT TO THESE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATING HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WHERE THESE OLDER PLACE WITH SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN WE THINK THE LIAISON APPROACH IN THE BILL MAKES SENSE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS? TO BROADEN THE GROUP OF WHO'S AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING TOGETHER THAT APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR ROLE CAN BE AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO HELP THESE CHILDREN. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. WE HAVE A REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER ALSO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND CENTER BELL. A YES UPPER SEVENTY QUESTION TERMS OF I HEARD TO UNDERSTAND OR AMENDMENTS TO BROADEN CAN YOU SPEAK PERHAPS -- TO WHAT THE AMENDMENT. WHO WHO ARE ADDING ON? WHERE IT EYES AT THE STAKEHOLDERS THE WE HAVE A LIAISON THAT IS SUPPOSED? TO HELP A CONNECT -- SERVICES AND SO AND WE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FATAL THERE'S YES I BUT I BELIEVE THIS WAS A CONVERSATION WITH THAT AB DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OKAY THAT ASKED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THAT WAS A BROADER CONVERSATION AND TALKED ABOUT ON THE TALK ABOUT GUIDANCE BEING. ISSUED TO THE COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE WHAT ARE APPROPRIATE ROLE AS AND DOT THAT WERE NECESSARILY BRING NEW SERVICES TO BEAR THAT WE DON'T HAVE TODAY BUT HOW WE CAN BRING WHAT WE HAVE TO BEAR TO HELP THESE CHILDREN. I APPRECIATE THAT I DIDN'T -- FIRST OF ALL I'M. ASSEMBLY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT AND AS A PEDIATRICIAN IN THE PEDIATRIC COMMUTERS -- EXTREME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THESE CHILDREN -- INTO THE PRESIDENT AMERICA K. PEDIATRICS ACTUALLY AND VISIT FACILITY. AND ESSENTIALLY DECLARED A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION AND I KNOW MANY OTHER PEDIATRICIANS HAVE -- HAVE SPOKEN OUT -- AND THOSE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY HAD ACCESS OR VIN OUR WORK AND THE LAST CALL TO HELP OUT SOME THIS FACILITIES HAVE CALLED OUT THESE ISSUES AS WELL SO. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT -- THESE FOR IN CALIFORNIA I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE OTHER STATES BUT LEAST HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO WHAT WE CAN -- TO HELP -- SUPPORT -- THESE CHILDREN RECOGNIZING THAT THEY ARE UNDER I GUESS FEDERAL JURISDICTION SO THAT LIMITS WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO BUT NOT. CLEARLY THAT IS NOT WHAT IN MY MIND AMERICA'S ABOUT IT'S REALLY NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRING FOR THE SPELLING BEE HAPPY TO MOVE IT APPROPRIATE TIME. CENTRE BELL SELECT COMMENT OF YES THE MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUSES THE SENATE WE HAD A PRESENTATION. ON THE SUBJECT OF THE EARLY PRESENTATION I THINK IN FEBRUARY AND I KNOW CENTER DRAWS THOSE. THE LEGISLATION IS PROCEEDING AS WELL BUT THE QUESTION I HAD -- FOR DO THE KIDS HAVE LAWYERS -- IS PART OF THE JOB WITH THE LAYS ON IS TO CONNECTING WITH THE LAWYERS RIGHT. SO SO NORTHERN LAWYERS TO REPRESENT. I LOOK AT THIS IS LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE LEARNED JUST LIKE KIDS IT DEPENDS THE COURT ORDERS. OR THEY SHOULD HAVE LAWYERS WHO THEY HAVE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR RIGHTS. AND YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY NEEDS. TO INFLICT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEGAL PROCESSES THAT SHOULD BE THE PART OF THE PROCESS RIGHT. SO I A YOU KNOW COULD YOU MAYBE. TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND I THINK WE'RE SETTING IT UP. THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE BILL BUT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP ON THE LEGAL LEGAL QUESTION I WOULD SAY JUST FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE GOING TO THESE DIFFERENT FACILITIES -- BOTH IN REDDING CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IT DEPENDED ON THE ACTUAL PLEASE WE WENT TO SO THERE ARE SOME -- FACILITY SECURE FACILITIES OR REGULAR FACILITIES WHERE YOU WOULD SPEAK TO KIDS WHO SAID -- ABSOLUTELY THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ATTORNEY -- WHO COMES HERE WEEKLY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE UPDATED ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR CASE AND OTHER SITUATIONS HE WOULD SAY -- I'VE BEEN MEN I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO A SOCIAL WORKER BUT I NEVER MET HER AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR NINE MONTHS AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY CASE. IT WAS IT WAS INCONSISTENT TO FATALLY OKAY SO IS SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROCESS AND SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED -- PERCENT AB ONE SIXTY THREE THAT WOULD DEFINITELY RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STREAMLINED TO THE EVERYONE KNOWS HAS ACCESS. TO I MEAN USUALLY THE LOCAL ORGANIZATION ORAL LAW SCHOOL CLINIC WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AT LEAST WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT EACH INDIVIDUAL IN. THE CENTER SKINNER AND I REVIEWED SOME OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT LEGAL. ISSUES IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WERE ON SO WE SPELL OF TIME ON US AND WE TRIED TO BRING THE DEPENDS ACCORDS LEGAL REPRESENTATION UP TO SNUFF. AT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH A HIGH -- CASELOAD YOU KNOW AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. THIS IS A SIMILAR KIND OF THE ISSUE AND I AM. YOU KNOW I KNOW WE PUT MONEY INTO IMMIGRATION LAWYERS BUT I THINK THESE. KIDS IS SPECIALLY SHOULD'VE ORDERS. OR SOMEBODY TO REPRESENT -- SOMEHOW. AND YOU KNOW. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT WE CAN DO THAT -- THAT WOULD HELP. I LIKE TO KNOW CAN YOU KNOW SOMEBODY. DOING A SOME KIND OF ASSESSMENT OF THAT ISSUE. SO AT NIGHT. WHEN WHEN WE STARTED THIS BILL WE WERE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE WHERE WE SAID THEY HAVE TO HAVE LAWYERS MEN AND? AND ASSESSMENT INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH -- AND SO IN THE PROCESS YOU KNOW OF OF WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE ENDED UP WITH THIS LIAISON WE HURT WE HEAR STORIES ABOUT THAT THERE'S JUST ENOUGH FIRE TYING THEM YOU CALL THIS NUMBER OR LEGAL ASSISTANCE. WE PUT MONEY ASIDE IN THE BUDGET TO HELP UNACCOMPANIED MINORS LEAGUE BUT LEGAL -- SERVICES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THESE CHILDREN BUT OFTENTIMES THE DOLLARS AREN'T ALL BEING USED BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE GROUPS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE KIDS BUT WHETHER THE KID IS TO MENTAL OR SIXTEEN YEARS ON THERE TO GETTING THIS FIRE WHEN THEY SHOW UP. IN OUR CUSTODY THE THING THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT TALLIES AT THE LEAST I CAN MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES BEYOND HIS THAT FLYER. AND HOPEFULLY MAKE THE CONNECTION TO THE LEGAL SERVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE OR IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ATTORNEYS AND WE WILL KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM TO BUT RIGHT NOW. IT'S REALLY LIMITED WHEN WE ASK HAD BEEN TOLD AT TIMES. BUT EVEN REYES. ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS LICENSE THAT WOULD DELIVER CHECK BECAUSE THEY'LL STOP SENDING OF KIDS AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE I GOING TO GO TO WORST PLACES AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME TO DO THAT BUT HE'S SAYING WELL MAYBE IF WE DID THE RIGHT. THING WE CAN ENCOURAGE OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD AD DO THE RIGHT THING BY ALL THESE KIDS ACROSS THE U. NOT TO SHARE IN CALIFORNIA. ON IT SO IT'S BEEN A REALLY FRUSTRATING PROCESS AS AS I THINKABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A TOOL AND WE SHOULD BE LEVERAGING THAT SOMEWHERE I DON'T PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT AT AS AN ATTORNEY AS A SOCIAL WORKER I I KNOW HOW TO TEACH YOU. MATH AND THAT'S IT RIGHT AND I KNOW HOW TO VOTE AND STUFF BUT IN TALKING TO THE EXPERTS. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST COMPROMISE MOVING FORWARD TO AT LEAST TRY TO DO IT BETTER I THINK THROUGH THESE LIAISONS YOU MIGHT DECIDE THAT WE NEED MORE LATER. BUT IT'S BEEN THE FIRST STEP -- IT IN IN THAT DIRECTION AND SO I HAVE TO JUST TRUST AND THE EXPERTS TELL ME THAT THAT THIS IS A GOOD FOR STEPS TO GO TO FOR THE FIRST HURDLE. ARE YOU YEAH THE QUESTION I I WAS THE ISSUE I WANTED TO RAISE. I THINK WHEN WE START RECOGNIZING THESE CHILDREN AS HUMAN BEINGS. ARE THAT'S THE FIRST STEP WE NEED TO TAKE LAWYERS OF COURSE THEY NEED LAWYERS EVERYONE. WHO COMES INTO THIS COUNTRY IS TECHNICALLY ENTITLED TO BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND WHATEVER THE GRIEVANCES ARE THAT? ARE BEING PRESENTED TO THEM. WHETHER BY THE GOVERNMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND I'M JUST REMINDED OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAD I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS BUT A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN A FEDERAL JUDGE DETERMINED THAT A THREE YEAR OLD WAS CAPABLE OF REPRESENTING OUR SELF? IN A YEAR -- AN IN IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS. IF WE'RE AT THAT POINT. IT'S JUST THE START ISSUING A GAG EITHER THOUGH THERE'S NO DESCRIPTIVE WORD I CAN USE THEIR BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. AND AGAIN I THINK -- WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS HUMAN BEINGS LIKE OURSELVES -- WE WILL HAVE COME A LONG WAY BUT UNTIL THEN I YEAH. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND MOVES THE BILL. SO DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NO OKAY A C. NONE OF WHICH YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA -- I WILL SAY THAT I GO HOME REGULARLY AND I'M SURE THE REST OF YOUR HERE AT HOME TO OUR FOLKS ASKING US TO DO SOMETHING DO ANYTHING. OUR ALL MORTIFIED BY THE STORIES THAT WERE SEEN -- AND HEARTBROKEN -- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HOPE WE COMMIT TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADD MORE TOOLS TO THE TOOLKIT FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS OUT THERE. THANK YOU. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY SENATOR PAN AND THEN THE SECOND ONE SENATOR JACKSON'S -- THE RECOMMENDED MOTION IS TO PASS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS AND SECRETARY CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

POOR FAMILIES POOR -- DOESN'T HELP THEIR CHILDREN GET TO SCHOOL. AND IT DOESN'T HELP THEIR CHILDREN BE HEALTHY UNVACCINATED WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY SUPPORTS VACCINATIONS AND SUPPORTS EDUCATING FAMILIES ON HOW TO BECOME VACCINATED. AND HOW TO MAINTAIN THE VACCINATION DOCUMENT DOCUMENTS -- AND HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR KIDS TO BE HEALTHY -- AS THEY ENTER INTO PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL WE THINK THIS BILL HELPS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BY -- REFORMING THE PENALTIES IN THE PROGRAM. AND WITH THAT WE ASK FOR A BILL THANK YOU. KEVIN OTHER COALITION CALIFORNIA WHAT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION WILL ALSO SPONSORING THE BILL AND PAY SO WITH THE BILL USED TO BE -- OFF TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN IZED COULD NOT GET THE VERIFICATION TO ACCOUNTING FOR SOME REASON.

ROB GROWS CLOSER ME HALF OF A VOICE FOR CHOICE ADVOCACY -- UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE PROPOSAL AS AMENDED WITH THE BILL I DO APOLOGIZE OUR LETTER GOT IN LATE WE GOT IT ON TUESDAY OF LAST WEEK -- THE BILL HAS AN EXCELLENT GOAL AND ONE THAT RESONATES WELL FOR ME I WAS BORN IN REAL AND AND GREW UP IN THE PAST FIGHTS AND WE WALKED OR TOOK THE BUS TO THE HOSPITAL -- SO IT'S ONE THAT ACTUALLY IS KIND OF ODDLY ENOUGH HITTING ME EMOTIONALLY A LITTLE BIT HERE -- SO WE COMPLETELY AGREE THE TEN AND THE INTENT OF THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY WE SUPPORTED THE BILL AS INTRODUCED AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY AND AND AND OPPOSE LAST MINUTE POSITION -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- ENSURING THAT THOSE THAT ARE POVERTY ARE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE CAL WORK BENEFITS -- ARE ESSENTIAL BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY BELIEVE THAT THE VACCINATION SHOULD NOT BE TIED TO THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY WE THINK THE BILL LACKS THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS PROTECTING PARENTS AND GUARDIANS FROM UNDUE PRESSURE. TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN EVEN THOUGH SUCH VACCINATIONS MAY BE HARMFUL -- OR OR AREAS WAS THE NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOKS FOR SPECIALIZATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THOSE ISSUES -- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT WHAT TWO SEVEN SEVEN DEAD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OF THIS BILLS NOT COMPLETELY IN LINE WITH THAT. I SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO COMPULSORY IMMUNIZATION FOR SCHOOL TENANTS AND AS WELL AS A CAL ORKS FUNDING FROM THE TANK BLOCK GRANT -- IS POTENTIALLY CAN BE HALTED. FOR A LACK OF CONSCIOUS FOR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS ARE BEING INCLUDED -- LASTLY GOING BACK TO A TWO EIGHTY THREE AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BILL THE SCHEDULE WHICH IS CURRENTLY MANDATED IN THE BILL DOES NOT MERE THEY REQUIREMENTS AND IT SENATE BILL. TWO SEVEN SEVEN FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN AS A BILL REQUIRES ROTAVIRUS PNEUMOCOCCAL INFLUENCE STILL AN INFLUENTIAL EXCUSE ME AND HAVE A AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS REFLECT WHAT WAS IN. TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND ON OF THE EXEMPTIONS GIVEN FOR HOME SCHOOLERS IN THOSE CHILDREN WITH A PIECE FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY THANK YOU. HI. MY NAME IS CANDACE JOHNSON. HI MY NAME IS CANDACE JOHNSON -- I WAS HERE LAST YEAR AND SPOKE IN A POSITION OF AB. ONE NINE NINE TWO I AM A CAL WORKS OF CASH AID FOOD STAMPS MEDICARE RECIPIENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS HELP EVERYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO ACTUALLY -- APPLY FOR THESE THINGS INSIDE THE OFFICE WITH THE CASE WORKER SO DO YOU HAVE A WORKING UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE ME IN THAT SITUATION. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS I GO IN FOR THE INITIAL -- ELIGIBILITY MEETING WHERE I SIT DOWN WITH WHAT'S CALLED AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER AND THEY DETERMINED BASED ON MY INCOME. WHAT I AM ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FROM THE STATE? THEY GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THEN THEY GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ASK ME IF I HAVE MY CHILDREN'S VACCINATION RECORDS RIGHT. AND I LOOK AT THEM AND I SAY I DO NOT BELIEVE IN VACCINATING MY CHILDREN. I DON'T LIKE TO USE THE BELIEVE WORD BECAUSE IT'S OUR BELIEF SYSTEM. BUT I DON'T VACCINATE MY CHILDREN RIGHT BASED OFF OF RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE. SO THEN WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO INTO THE COMPUTER IN THE CLICK OF A FEW TIMES AND PRINT OUT THIS CALL BACKS NATION GOOD CALLS FORM. YOU'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN A COPY SO. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GIVE YOU A LIST OF REASONS AS TO WHY YOU DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION NOT GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT VACCINATING? GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT HAVING DOCUMENTATION FOR NOT VACCINATING. THE VERY FIRST ONE SAYS YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN IMMUNIZING YOUR CHILDREN THAT IS THE ONE THAT I'VE ALWAYS CIRCLED AND HANDED IT STRAIGHT BACK. EVERY SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE TO RECERTIFY. IN PERSON YOU DON'T HAVE TO pTHERE'S NO WAY THAT A PERSON COULD NOT GET THIS TURNED INTO THE OFFICE IS MY POINT. SO THERE'S NO WAY THAT. SOMEONE COULD BE. HAVE THEIR BENEFITS DEDUCTED BECAUSE OF LACK OF THE FORM BECAUSE HEY PRINT IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE IN FRONT OF YOU WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN THE OFFICE THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF THE OFFICE WITHOUT HAVING DONE THIS -- AND SO. IF SO IF I IN SIX MONTHS GO BACK TO RECERTIFY FOR MY BENEFITS I'M GONNA GET DOCKED FIFTY DOLLARS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN VACCINATING MY CHILDREN. WHEN VACCINATING MY CHILDREN HAS ZERO TO DO WITH HOW MUCH INCOME I HAVE OR WHAT MY BILLS COST? SO MY CHILDREN VACCINATIONS THAT IT SHOULD NEVER BE ON THE TABLE AS A DETERMINING FACTOR OF ELIGIBILITY FOR AID EVER. IS MY POINT -- WHETHER OR NOT MY CHILDREN ARE VACCINATED THEY STILL NEED TO EAT. WHETHER OR NOT MY CHILDREN VACCINATED I STILL NEED TO BUY THE BOOK BAGS CLOTHES FOR SCHOOL PUT GAS IN THE CAR. ALL THOSE THINGS SO -- YOU KNOW INFANT IT CITES A STUDY IN THERE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR ON THE TH. ON PAGE. SEVEN SAYS THE STUDY. FOUND THE UNVACCINATED CHILDREN THOSE MISSING ALL ROUTINE VACCINES TENDED TO BE WHITE. HAVE A MOTHER WHO WAS MARRIED AND HAD A COLLEGE DEGREE LIVE IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH AN INCOME OF OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND HAVE PARENTS WHO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THESE VACCINES. RIGHT BEFORE THAT IT SAYS. UP UNDER VACCINATED NOT UNVACCINATED UNDER VACCINATED. CHILDREN MISSING ONE OR MORE ROUTINE VACCINES TENDED TO BE BLACK HOW YOUNG UNMARRIED MOTHER WHO DID NOT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND LIVE IN A HOUSEHOLD NEAR THE POVERTY LEVEL. BUT THEY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE PERSON THAT FALLS UNDER BOTH BRACKETS ME I LIVE UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL I AM A WHITE WOMAN WHO IS MARRIED. WITH SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT I CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE MY KIDS IT'S NOT BECAUSE I CAN'T GET TO THE DOCTOR. BECAUSE EVEN WHEN I GET TO THE DOCTOR AND STILL TELLING THAT DOCTOR NO I'M NOT BACK STATING MY KIDS [inaudible]SO. THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH IT. BECAUSE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW I'M GONNA BE DOCKED FIFTY BUCKS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN VACCINATING MY KIDS THAT SHOULDN'T BE.
