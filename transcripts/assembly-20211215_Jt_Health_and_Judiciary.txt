WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE HAVE A VERY- AMBITIOUS AGENDA TODAY- AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A VERY. FULL DAY OF EXPLORING THE L. P. S. ACT AS IT RELATES TO INVOLUNTARY DETAINMENT AND TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS FOUND TO BE EITHER A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. OR WHO ARE GRAVELY DISABLED. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING MY CO CHAIR MR STONE AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL THE WORKERS GONE INTO PREPARING FOR THIS HEARING. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK IN ADVANCE ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WHO AGREED TO SHARE THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE TODAY. AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK IT'S OUR JOB TODAY TO LISTEN AND LEARN. I REMINDED OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEEK FIRST TO UNDERSTAND AND THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS I WANT TO BELIEVE C. O. P. S. ACTORS OPERATING AT MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS. IN SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE SYSTEM IS QUITE COMPLEX AND NUANCED IF WE'RE GOING TO SEEK WAYS TO IMPROVE THE L. P. S. SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS IT IS INTENDED TO SERVE. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND THE DIFFICULTIES BEING ENCOUNTERED NOT ONLY BY THOSE WHO EXPERIENCING AN LPS HOLD OR CONSERVATORSHIP. BY THOSE WHO WERE OR BUT BY THOSE- ARE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL. THE QUESTION BEFORE US AS A BEST POLICYMAKERS IS HOW DO WE- THE DALLAS THE OBVIOUS NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL AND OFTENTIMES PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE TREATMENT AND TREATMENT WITH ENSURING CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENCROACHED UPON. I HOPE AS WE WORK THROUGH TODAY'S AGENDA WE WILL CONSISTENTLY ASK OURSELVES HOW ARE THE INTERESTS OF THE L. P. S. CONCERT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR FAMILIES BEST SERVED IN THE LONG RUN. AT THE EPICENTER ALL OVER THOUGHT SHOULD BE THE CARE AND CONCERN OF SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS- MR STONE DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. HE WAS. VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND- THAT. YES STATUTE WORKS THE SOME OF THE COMPLICATING ISSUES THOUGH ARE FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STANDPOINT REAL LACK OF APPROPRIATE SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE AS NEEDED AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY COUNTY THE COUNTY NOT NECESSARILY THEIR FAULT BUT A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY IN. THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION IN SUPPORT OF COUNTIES SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT IF WE ARE DEFINITIONS FOR FINDING OTHER WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO BE CONSERVE THEN I THINK FIRST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS FOR PEOPLE TO GO. I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIT OF A DEEP DIVE IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG A LONG DAY SO WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE EVERYONE KEEPING TO THEIR TIME SO THAT WE CAN GET TO EVERYBODY BOTH IN THE MORNING AND THE AFTERNOON SESSIONS THAT. THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN COLLECT INFORMATION AND THEN FROM THIS LOOK AT POLICY NEXT YEAR POLICY THAT'S LEFT OVER FROM LAST YEAR. AND TRY IN IN SHAPE THE BEST POLICY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN FOR CALIFORNIA. BEING MINDFUL OF THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS BEING CONSERVE THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILY NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY OR ARE OFTEN CONFLICTING AND NOT EASY TO SORT OUT FOR THAT IS OUR CHALLENGE TODAY. TO LISTEN TO GAIN PERSPECTIVE AND THEN ULTIMATELY FIGURE OUT NEXT STEPS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STONE I WILL NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE WILL HAVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARRIVING THROUGH THE DAY. INCLUDING SENATOR EGGMAN WHO'S NOT A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE OUR HOUSE BUT SHE'S- SHE'S WELCOME HERE AND- WHEN SHE ARRIVES WE'LL ASK HER IF SHE'D LIKE TO JOIN US UPON THE DIET SO- DO YOU HAVE ANY BRIEF COMMENTS DR. OKAY VERY GOOD OKAY THANK YOU SO- WITH THAT WE'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND KIND OF JUMP INTO OUR FIRST PANEL RECOGNIZING THAT KEEPING. KEEPING EVERYTHING. ON OUR SCHEDULE WILL BE TIGHT WILL LEFT. TAKE OFFENSE THE FACT THAT WE'RE LIKE THREE MINUTES AHEAD BECAUSE I WON'T LAST SO- SO FIRST OUR FIRST PANEL- WILL BE. AN OVERVIEW OF THE- LET AND LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT AFTER WAS CALLED LPS ACT PLEASE IF THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S OKAY. THIS WILL BE KIM LEWIS MANAGING ATTORNEY A NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. KOREA SHE TO THE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE OHIO- GENET GIONALE ITO ORAL DIVISION. CHIEF LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION. BERMAN OF HEALTH CARE SIR. TO GET THAT RIGHT. A GOOD OKAY. MERRILEES PEREZ DIVISION CHIEF COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS PEOPLE WILL APPEAR BEFORE US TODAY- COREY IS PRESENT IN IN IN THE IN THE ROOM AND THE OTHERS WILL APPEAR ON OUR SCREENS OVER HERE. SO WITH THIS- PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY- MISS LEWIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK I HAVE SOME SLIDES I'M HOPING WILL BE POSTED SE- GOOD MORNING CHAIRS WOODEN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KEN LEWIS AND THE MANAGING ATTORNEY OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE. THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM- WE ARE A I'M NONPROFIT LAW OFFICE THAT WORKS TO ADVANCE LOW INCOME HEALTHCARE. ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE LPS FACT HOPEFULLY. YOU CAN SEE THAT FIRST LINE AND- I'LL ASK PEOPLE TO ADVANCE THE SLIDES BY SAYING NEXT FIGHTS LET'S. WORK SO HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A ROAD MAP OF WHAT I'M GOING TO COVER. WE TALK ABOUT THE- KEY FEDERAL AND STATE RIGHTS THAT ARE IMPLICATED BY THE CIVIL COMMITMENT LAWS PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF. HISTORY OF THE CIVIL COMMITMENT. LEADING UP TO THE LPS ACT AND THEN GO THROUGH. YEP YES THAT COMPONENTS WHICH INCLUDE CIVIL COMMITMENT CONSERVATORSHIP- OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FINALLY PROVIDER JUST BRIEF- COVERAGE OF SOME RECENT LEGISLATION THAT HAS. BEEN IN- IN. INTRODUCED IN THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS TO EXPAND THE LPS AT. EXLINE SO- JUST WANTED TO START WITH THE CONTEXT OF DISABILITY RIGHTS LAWS AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE SO. YOU KNOW THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT TITLE TO REQUIRES- THAT SERVICES PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES BE ADMINISTERED IT MUST INTEGRATE APPROPRIATE SETTING. TO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THIS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE INTEGRATION MANDATE. THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING IS WHERE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES ARE INTEGRATED TOGETHER. IN SECTION FIVE OH FOR THE REHAB ACT WAS REALLY FOR CIVIL RIGHTS LAW DESIGNED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS. WITH DISABILITIES FROM DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR DISABILITY STATUS. A LAW PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN ALL PROGRAMS THAT ARE RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S A LANDMARK CASE OF COURSE OF ALL STATE RESOURCES L. C. OR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HELD THAT AND- NECESSARY SEGREGATION INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. HIGHLIGHTS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND THAT STATES HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE OBLIGATION. TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. I LIVE IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING POSSIBLE. WAS RESULT OF HOMESTEAD. OUR STATES DEVELOPED ON STEP PLANTS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA HAS SUCH A PLAN AS WELL. EXLINE SO WHAT'S AT STAKE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WELL WE KNOW THAT A CIVIL COMMITMENT LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. INFRINGE ON A HOST OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS NAMELY THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY. AND DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT STATES THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY WITHOUT UE PROCESS. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT ALSO PROMISES THAT ALL PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES. SHOP CHOI EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS. IN ARTICLE ONE OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ALSO GUARANTEES DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION. THE SUPREME COURT IN- ADDINGTON VERSUS TEXAS FOUND THE CIVIL COMMITMENT FOR ANY PURPOSE CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY THAT REQUIRES TO PROCESS PROTECTIONS. A NUMBER OF. US SUPREME COURT CASES SINCE THAT AND SOME OTHER ARE LISTED HERE HAVE REINFORCED THE ACCORD LIBERTIES AT RISK AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF G. OF DUE PROCESS UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE- THOSE CASES INVOLVED PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SOME OF THEM WERE INVOLVING ALSO PEOPLE WHO HAD- EITHER SEXUALLY DANGEROUS. INDIVIDUALS OR PEOPLE ARE COMMITTING CRIMES. SO THEIR NUMBER OF THE STATE- COURT CASES THAT ARE ALSO ADDRESSED INVOLUNTARY CONFINEMENT AND DUE PROCESS UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION PARTICULARLY. ARCH RELATION TO LPS CONSERVATORSHIP AND BECAUSE THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE INFRINGED ON THERE'S AN INHERENT RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND RIGHTS COUNCIL THE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR REVIEW CAN VERY. FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND RACIAL DISPARITIES AS ONE NEW YORK OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM FOUND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE PEOPLE TO BE INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED FOR OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC CARE. HOWEVER THE CANDIDATES FOR THE OUTPATIENT COMMITMENT WERE LARGELY DRAWN FROM A POPULATION IN WHICH CASE SINCE PATIENTS WERE BLACK WERE OVER REPRESENTED PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND PUBLIC FACILITIES. NEXT TIME. SO WHY THE LPS ACT AFTER A LONG HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONAL THEY COULD INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SEGREGATION OF PEOPLE IT WITH DISABILITIES IN STATE HOSPITALS AND FOLLOWING WIDESPREAD NEWS REPORTS OF ABUSE AND DEATH THE STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WERE LARGELY CLOSED IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AND NOW THEY MOSTLY HOUSE PEOPLE WERE DEEMED CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR THOSE WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY. BY THE COURTS YET THE MONEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY SO SERVICES WERE LARGELY NOT AVAILABLE THERE AND THERE IS NO FUNDING DEDICATED TO DEVELOP THOSE COMMUNITY SERVICES. THANKS A LOT. SO THIS IS THE ARE THE INTENT OF THE LPS ACT WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY ALSO- AMENDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BY SB THREE SIXTY FOUR- AND THESE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THIS LIST. ONE IS THAT YOU AND THE INAPPROPRIATE INDEFINITE INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. AND TO LIMIT LEGAL DISABILITIES. AND SECONDLY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS OF EACH PERSON. ARE RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES. LEE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE ADA'S EMBLEM- INTEGRATION MANDATE WHICH REQUIRES MORE REALLY ACCESS TO VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ALLOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITY. EXLINE. SO TALKING ABOUT INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS- ALTHOUGH THE AS HE SAID THE ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN IT WAS UPDATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS WAS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT MODERNIZATION OF THE INVOLUNTARY DETENTION PROCEDURES OF THE FACT AND THE CHANGES THAT TOOK EFFECT INCLUDED AMONG OTHERS EXPANDING THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT CAN BE UTILIZED AS LPS DESIGNATED FACILITIES TO- SUCH AS TWENTY THREE ARE CRISIS FACILITIES. CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS CRISIS- PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES IT ALSO AUTHORIZED EVALUATION BY TELEHEALTH AND ALLOWED COUNTIES TO DESIGNATE- PROFESSIONALS TO BE OF DETAINING INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE LPS ACT UNDER SECTION FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO IT EXPANDED REALLY WHO WAS ALLOWED TO DO THOSE COMMITMENTS BIT INTO THE LPS ACCESSIBLE COMMITMENTS OF WHAT A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS THE LPS ACT PROVIDES THAT IF THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE A PERSON IS GRAVELY DISABLED OR DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE AS A RESULT OF A MENTAL DISORDER THEN A PEACE OFFICER DESIGNATED TREATMENT FACILITIES STAFF OR MOBILE CRISIS TEAM RATHER PROFESSIONAL PERSON AS DESIGNATED BY THE COUNTY CAN TAKE THEM INTO CUSTODY FOR A PERIOD OF SEVEN TWO HOURS FOR ASSESSMENT EVALUATION. PRICES INTERVENTION OR PLACEMENT AND TREATMENT AND IT APPEARS DESIGNATED FACILITY. PROBABLE CAUSE MEANS THE FACTS WOULD LEAD A PERSON OF ORDINARY CARE AND PRUDENCE TO BELIEVE. OR SUSPECT THAT THE PERSON MEETS THAT CRITERIA. BEEN REALLY DISABLED MEANS A PERSON IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER BECAUSE OF MENTAL DISORDER. SO BEING HOMELESS FOR EXAMPLE BY ITSELF WOULD NOT MEET THOSE GREAT DISABILITY STANDARDS HOWEVER SOMEONE WHO CAN'T TAKE. UP ISN'T ABLE OR WILLING TO TAKE FOOD OR SHELTER AS A DIRECT RESULT OF A MENTAL DISORDER WOULD LIKELY BE CONSIDERED GRADED DISABLE- THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY IS AN APPLICATION FOR INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT ON ADMISSION FORM. SO GUESS INDIVIDUAL TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE PROFESSIONAL STAFF THEN DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE DETENTION ITSELF. ONCE ADMITTED TO A FACILITY ON A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. PERSON HAS- CAN BE DETAINED FOR UP TO FOURTEEN DAYS FOR INTENSIVE TREATMENT IF THE PERSON CONTINUES TO POSE A DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS OR BE GREAT THE DISABLED- THEY HAVE TO BE ALSO BE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT TREATMENT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. AND ONCE THEY'RE ON THAT FOURTEEN DOUBLE. IF A RIGHT TO CERTIFICATION REVIEW HEARING THIS HEARING MUST BE HELD WITHIN FOUR DAYS OF BEING PLACED ON FOURTEEN DAY HOLD. ON THE STANDARD THE HEARING IS PROBABLY BECAUSE- THIS IS ENTITLED TO WRITTEN NOTICE OF THEM BEING HELD ON THE REASONS ARE BEING HELD. AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ASSISTANCE FROM A PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATE AT THE HEARING WHO HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS. AND ADVOCATE FOR THEIR INTERESTS. ONCE ON A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO FILE A- WRIT WITH BILL RITTER HABEAS CORPUS WITH OF SPIRIT COURT- THEY CAN FILE THIS IF THEY'RE NOT RELEASED AT THE CERTIFICATION REVIEW HEARING. THANKS FOR THE READ THE COURT MUST. HOLD AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING HELD WITHIN TO JUDICIAL DAYS AFTER THE PETITIONS FILED. IN THE COUNTY BEARS THE BURDEN OF PROVIDING. A LAWFULNESS OF THE DETENTION BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. FIFTY ONE FIFTEEN OR FOURTEEN DAY HOLD DOES NOT ALLOW A PERSON TO BE INVOLUNTARILY. MEDICATED ABSENT AN EMERGENCY. A SEPARATE COMPETENCY HEARING FOR THAT PURPOSE IS REQUIRED. THESE ARE OFTEN CALLED REESE HEARINGS OR BASED ON THE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE OF RESOURCES ST MARY'S HOSPITAL. NECKLINE. EXTENDED VOLUNTARY HOLDS- ESSENTIALLY THE LAW ALLOWS FOR PERSON WHO HAS BEEN DETAINED FOR FOURTEEN DAYS OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT TO BE DETAINED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT IF THEY REMAIN GRAVELY DISABLED AND ARE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT TREATMENT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE THESE THIRTY DAY HOLDS IN FACT IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER BEING PLACED ON HOLD CONSERVATORSHIP PAPERS MAY BE FILED IN THIS CASE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP WOULD RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH THAT. THIRTY DAY HOLD. WE'LL BE GOING THE CONSERVATORSHIP AFTER THIS. I'M AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE FOURTEEN DAY HOLD PERSON WHO AS A RESULT OF A MENTAL DISORDER OR CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM REMAINS A DANGER TO SELF. PERSON CAN BE DETAINED RENDITION OF FOURTEEN DAYS TO QUALIFY FOR THIS PERSON MUST HAVE THREATENED OR ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE OR WERE DETAINED- FOR VALUATION TREATMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE SHE ATTEMPTED TO TAKE HIS OUR HOME LIFE AND CONTINUES TO BE AN IMMINENT THREAT. TAKING HIS ARE ONLY. SUPERIOR COURT CAN ALSO ORDER INTIMATELY DANGEROUS PERSON TO OTHERS TO BE CONFINED. OR FURTHER ON INTENSIVE TREATMENT FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. IF THE PERSON IS DEMONSTRATED DANGER OF UPLIFTING SUBSTANTIAL PHYSICAL HARM ON OTHERS. RISEN UPON ORDERED DETAINED UNDER THIS AUTHORITY HAS A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY AND A MANAGER A TRIAL. IT CAN ALSO CONTINUE ON AN OUTPATIENT OUTPATIENT BASIS WHERE THAT CAN STATUS CAN BE REVOKED IF THEY ON THE BECOME DANGEROUS AGAIN. EXLINE. SO THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL RULES FOR MINORS- AS THERE'S A CIVIL COMMITMENT- CHILDREN'S OF A COMMITMENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT ACT IS PART OF THE LPS ACT SO THE MINERS RESULTS OF- BEING A MENTAL DISORDER IS A DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS ARE GRAVELY DISABLED AND THE- THERE'S NO ADULTS OR PARENT TO VOLUNTARILY COMMIT OR OR PLACE THE CHILD INTO THE FACILITY THEN THEY CAN BE PUT ON A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD THE FACILITY HAS TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO NOTIFY THE MINOR'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEIR TO CHANGE. AND A GREAT THE DISABLED MINOR IS ONE WHO AS A RESULT OF THE MENTAL DISORDERS UNABLE TO USE THE ELEMENTS OF LIFE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO HEALTH SAFETY DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER EVEN THOUGH PROVIDED TO THE MINOR BY OTHERS MINORS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THEMSELVES. SO ELECT DISABILITIES ACT APPLE OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ALCOHOLISM OR DRUG ABUSE OR REPEATED ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIORS ARE NOT IN THEMSELVES CONSTITUTE A MENTAL DISORDER. AND THE MINOR MUST RECEIVE A CLINICAL EVALUATION CONSISTING OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS OF THEIR MEDICAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONDITIONS. AND THE EVALUATION HAS TO INCLUDE- FAMILY EVALUATION AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL RULES FOR DEPENDENTS ON WORDS OF THE JUVENILE COURT THEY MUST FOLLOW THE LPS ACT AS THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY OR SOCIAL WORK OR THE JUVENILE COURT CAN'T AUTHORIZE HOSPITALIZATION. BUT A MINOR CAN BE HELP- CAN SEEK VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ON THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL EITHER INPATIENT OR OUTPATIENT UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INDIAN WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CO. NEXT SLIDE. WHEN I QUICKLY GO INTO CONSERVATORSHIP SEN WE KNOW LEGAL LPS CONSERVATORSHIP FOR A MECHANISM IN WHICH THE COURT APPOINTS ANOTHER PERSON TO MAKE CERTAIN CERTAIN LEGAL DECISIONS A CONSERVATIVE- BASED ON FINDINGS THAT THE PERSON'S GRAVE DISABLED AS A RESULT OF A MENTAL DISORDER- THE PURPOSE OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP IS TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT. OF SUPERVISION AND PLACEMENT SO. I'M LET'S GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP IS A PERSON WHO IS DETAINED ESSENTIALLY ON A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD OF WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT AT THE END OF THE HOLD MAY BE PLACED ON A TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP FOR THIRTY DAYS PROFESSIONAL. A DETERMINES THAT THEY ARE BOTH GRAVELY DISABLED AND UNWILLING TO ACCEPT TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY. SO THAT- CARE PROVIDER MAKE RECOMMENDATION TO THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE TO STARTED INSERTION COMBUSTED CATION. AND INVESTIGATOR WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO REQUEST THE COURT TO STARTED CONSERVATIVE SHIP- IN ALL POSSIBLE OF TURN ALTERNATIVES TO CONSORTIUM. ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EXAMINED ONLY RECOMMENDING CONSERVATORSHIP BUT THERE AREN'T A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVES. IF THE INVESTIGATION RECOMMENDS CONSERVATORSHIP THEN- THE PERSON MOST SUITABLE TO SERVE AS A CONSERVATIVE IS APPOINTED IT CAN BE A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE WHO IS THE MOST SUITABLE PERSON OR AGENCY TO BE APPOINTED. IF THE COURT GRANTS THE PETITION IN ORDER THE TERM TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP. VINES NO PERSON IS WILLING TO BE A CONSERVE OUR THAT IT WILL APPOINT THE PUBLIC PARTY- PEOPLE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE HELD ON A T. CONNOR TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP HAVE A RIGHT TO A RICH. IN THE SPIRIT COURT. AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE COUNTY BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PERSON MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR DETENTION. THANKS LIVE. SO AFTER THAT THIRTY DAY TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP THEY MUST BE RELEASED UNLESS THE COURT CONDUCTS A HEARING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THEY'RE OPPOSE CONSERVATIVE STILL GRAVELY DISABLED HEARING HAS TO BE HELD ON ALL PETITIONS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE POSITION PUBLIC DEFENDER OR ATTORNEY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE E. WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE DATE OF PETITIONS. SO THE CONSERVATIVES ARE RIGHT TO DEMAND A JURY TRIAL OR COURT TRIAL ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THEY'RE GREAT THE DISABLED. THE COURT CAN EXTEND THE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP UNTIL THE DATA ABOUT DISPOSITION OF THE COURT. FOR JURY TRIAL PROVIDED THAT IT'S NO LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS EXTENSION THE PERSON MUST MAKE A REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL WITHIN FIVE DAYS THE HEARING ON THE CONSERVATORSHIP PETITION. IF THEY HAVE A JURY TRIAL JURY MUST BE UNANIMOUS AND THE PERSON WHO. IS- DETERMINED TO MEET THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. A TRIAL SHOULD OCCUR WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THE REQUEST OF THE COURT CAN. EXTEND UP TO FIFTEEN DAYS. OKAY NEXT SLIDE SO WHAT ARE THE POWERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE- SERVER IS USED- USUALLY HAS THE POWER TO DECIDE PLACEMENT SO THAT'S WHERE THE PERSON LIVES THE PERSON- CONSERVATIVES THE GREASE ABOUT PLACEMENT AND THE CONSERVATIVE YOU CAN GO BACK TO COURT AND CHALLENGE THAT APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS IS CALLED THE PLACEMENT REVIEW HEARING- IF THE CONSERVANCY IS UNSUCCESSFUL AT THAT HEARING THEY HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAN CHALLENGE THAT PLACEMENT. CONSERVER CAN OPERATE IS AUTHORIZED BY THE COURT TO MAKE DECISIONS- THOSE ARE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE COURT ORDER. SUCH AS WHETHER THEY CAN START OR STOP PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS. OR MAKE OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT DECISIONS. ADDITIONALLY CONSERVATIVE IN MANAGING THEIR FINANCES. OTHER RIGHTS THE COURT CAN REMOVE ARE THE PERSON'S RIGHT TO VOTE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS. ALONE TO DRIVE HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR TO OWN A FIREARM. LPS CONSERVATORSHIP LAST FOR A MAXIMUM OF ONE YEAR BUT CAN BE RENEWED AT THE END OF THAT YEAR. THE CONSERVANCY CAN PETITION FOR REHEARING TO SEE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE ON CONSERVATORSHIP EVERY SIX MONTHS TRIAL AND NOT. NEXT SLIDE SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPANDED CONSERVATORSHIP PILOTS- S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE WHICH WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CREATED A WHAT'S CALLED A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP PILOT PROVIDED AND PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR BROADER CONSERVATORSHIP CRITERIA AND SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES- BASED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AUTHORIZATION OF ITS USE. IT ALLOWED FOR APPOINTMENT OF A CONSERVATIVE A PERSON WHO'S INCAPABLE OF CARING FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING DUE TO A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AS EVIDENCED BY FREQUENT DETENTION. OR VALUATION TREATMENT OR SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. ESSENTIALLY MEANS EIGHT OR MORE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. IT REQUIRES A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FIND THE SPECIFIC SERVICES INCLUDING SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOUSING AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES PUBLIC CONSERVATORS. NOW HOW SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND SERVICE PLANNING AND DELIVERY SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY. RESOURCES AND FUNDING. LEVELS TO SERVE THE IDENTIFIED POPULATION. IT ALSO REQUIRES A COUNTY ESTABLISHES STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUP TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS. AND ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT IN THE DRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE FOLKS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND SUBMIT A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THE FIRST ONE WAS NO LATER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A FINAL REPORT IS DUE TO LEGISLATURE- IT BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. A LOT OF SUNSETS ON ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THEN LATER SB FORTY WAS AN ACCIDENT TWENTY NINETEEN TO FURTHER EXPAND THIS CONSERVATORSHIP AUTHORITY BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THAT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT SO IT'S NO LONGER. REQUIRED TO BE EITHER UNSUCCESSFUL OR HAVE BEEN DENIED IT ALSO SHORTEN THE CONSERVATIVE SHIPS TO SIX MONTHS BUT THEY ARE RENEWABLE. NEXT TIME SO I WANT TO TALK JUST ABOUT THE OUTPATIENT ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS- KNOWN AS LAURA'S LAW THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING OUTPATIENT TREATMENT UNDER CIVIL COMMITMENT ORDER OR INVOLUNTARILY THANKS LIKE. SOLARZ LAW WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO- AN ESTABLISHED ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION- AFTERNOON THIS IS ESSENTIALLY NAMED AFTER A MAN WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION FATALLY SHOT LAURA WILCOX IN NINETEEN WILL VOLUNTEERED IN NEVADA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC AND IT WAS MODELED AFTER NEW YORK'S OUTPATIENT. GRAHAM HAD CALLED KENDRA'S LAW. LEGISLATION ALLOWS EACH COUNTY IN THE STATE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM AND THERE'S NO FUNDING ATTACHED THIS LEGISLATION. IMPORTANT TO NOTE THOUGH THAT- WILD IMPEDES- THE IMPETUS IS LEGISLATION WAS THIS TRAGIC EVENT- I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE WITH MENTAL CONDITIONS ARE NOT DANGEROUS. I SAW. SO WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF THIS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR A. O. T. REALLY ANY PERSON OVER EIGHTEEN THAT LIVES WITH INDIVIDUAL A PARENT SPOUSE SIBLING- A PEACE OFFICER PAROLE OFFICER PROBATION OFFICER. PUBLIC AGENCY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER JUDGES NOW ESSENTIALLY CAN REFER A PERSON FOR THIS PROGRAM. IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD- OPPORTUNITY FOR REFERENCE SHARE REFERRAL. A LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER HAS TO PERSONALLY EXAMINE THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THAT PETITION. NO MORE THAN TEN DAYS PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF THE PETITION. AND ATTEMPT TO GET AGREEMENT TOO BIG OR ATTEMPT TO HELP GET THEIR AGREEMENT TO BE EXAMINED. THE PROVIDER WHO BELIEVES A PERSON MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT MUST BE WILLING ABLE TO EXAMINE THE PERSON TESTIFIED. AT THE HEARING ON THE PETITIONS THE NEXT SLIDE. TO QUALIFY. FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THIS A. O. T. PROGRAM AN INDIVIDUAL MUST HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDER THAT RESULTS IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION OR INCARCERATION TWICE IN THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS. TREATED IN JAIL OR PRISON. TWO TIMES IN THE LAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS OR RESULT IN A VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT MONTHS. SO VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALSO HAS TO BE OFFERED AND REFUSED. COURT BASED ON THE PETITION TO OBTAIN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT MAKES VARIOUS FINDINGS INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS THAT THERE'S BEEN A CLINICAL DETERMINATION THAT THE PERSON IS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT SUPERVISION. PERSON'S CONDITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATING AND IN VIEW OF THE PERSON'S TREATMENT HISTORY AND CURRENT BEHAVIOR THAT THEY ARE IN NEED OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT ORDER REVENT A LIVE RELAPSE. OR DETERIORATION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN GRAVE DISABILITY OR SERIOUS HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS- GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT LIKE WITH OTHER CIVIL COMMITMENTS OR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS RIGHT TO NOTICE COPY OF EVALUATION RIGHT TO COUNSEL. OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ALWAYS APPOINTED IF THERE IS NOT A COUNCIL THAT THE PERSON CAN- OBTAIN ON THEIR OWN. RIGHT TO A HEARING TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. RIGHT TO SEEK A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN FRONT OF SUPERIOR COURT. NEXT TIME. SO AFTER THE HEARING ON ALL RIGHT WELL OF AN EVIDENCE THE COURT CAN'T FIND BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE PERSON MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR A. O. T. AND THAT THERE IS NO APPROPRIATE. AND FEASIBLE LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE. ALL IT DOES NOT EXCEED- THE COURT ORDER. THE PERSON TO IN A PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED SIX MONTHS. JUST ASSISTANCE MUST INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TEAM TEAM PLANNING ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARE GENDER AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE- THE COURT IS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER DANCE HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVES A PERSON HAS IN DETERMINING THE TREATMENT PLAN. AND EVERY SIXTY DAYS- THE DIRECTOR OF THE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM MUST FILE AN AFFIDAVIT WITH THE COURT THAT ORDERED THE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM AND AFFIRMING THE PERSON CONTINUES TO MEET THE CRITERIA. AT THESE TIMES A PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO A HEARING ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY STILL MEET THE CRITERIA IF THEY DISAGREE M. OF BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE DIRECTOR TO SHOW- THAT THEY MADE IT. PERSON CAN FILE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AGAIN REQUIRING OF THAT THERE'D BE A HEARING ON THAT TO REVIEW THE DETERMINATION OF THE MEET THE CRITERIA. NEXT SLIDE SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES TO THE A. R. T. PROGRAM SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE BUYS IN CENTER STAMBERG IN TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN WHICH ENABLE PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE A. O. T. PROGRAM WAS ONE OF THEM THERE'S A FEW OTHER MORE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES AND I'M GOING TO QUICKLY GO OVER. EXCITED. A PATIENT TREATMENT- LARA'S LOG ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY AB NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SIX WAS CHOPPERED INTO LAW AMENDING THE CURRENT A. O. G. OUR EFFECTIVE JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT ALL REQUIRED TO OFFER A O. T. OR THEY MUST OPT OUT. MOUNTIES MAY OFFER SERVICES INDEPENDENTLY OR PARTNER WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. DISSIPATING COUNTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BECOME FULLY OPERATIONAL. THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DELAY THE PROGRAM EFFECTIVE DATE THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IN PLACE. CAN YOU TO OPT OUT FROM PARTICIPATING MUST PASS A RESOLUTION BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHICH STATES THE REASON. AND THE FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES USED TO MAKING THAT DECISION. IT ALSO REVEALED THE SUNSET DATE OF THIS LAW SO THERE IS NO SUNSET DATE THEREBY EXTENDING THE PROGRAM INDEFINITELY. AND PROHIBITS THE COUNTY FROM REDUCING EXISTING VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE A. O. T. SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY ALLOWS THE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE TO PETITION FOR THE L. T. AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE SO THE RECENT EXPANSIONS OF A. O. G. M. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH SB. FIVE OH SEVEN- THE LEGISLATION BROADENED A. R. T. CRITERIA BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO FIND SYSTEM OUT PATIENT TREATMENT TO BE BASED ON A CLINICAL DETERMINATION THE PERSON IS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT SUPERVISION THE PERSON'S CONDITION IS EITHER SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATING OR THAT THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS NEEDED TO PREVENT A RELAPSE. OR- OF DETERIORATION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN GREAT DISABILITY OR SERIOUS HARM TO SOMEONE ELSE- THEMSELVES SO THAT ESSENTIALLY NO LONGER REQUIRES THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATING. SECONDLY REQUIRES THAT A MEDICATION COMPETENCY HEARING BE INCLUDED IN THE A. O. T. PETITIONS SO NOW THIS IS NO LONGER A SEPARATE DETERMINATION ABOUT THEIR CAPACITY TO REFUSE AND I SACCADIC MEDICATION. THIRD IT DOES AUTHORIZES OF THE FILING OF A PETITION BE ATTAINED FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT UNDER THE EXISTING PROCEDURES FOR A PERSON WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP BUT SEEKING TO END THEIR CONSERVATIVE SHIP SO. ESSENTIALLY CAN TRY TO UTILIZE A. O. T. WHEN- IF THE CONSERVATORSHIP IS EITHER ENDURANCE AND SUCCESSFUL. NEXT SLIDE. SO IT'S JUST REALLY IS NOT MY LASTS FOR A POINT IS FINALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT BRIEFLY MENTIONING RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS AND ADDITIONAL ONES I'VE GONE OVER A DATA ACTUALLY NOW IN LAW. ARE THOSE- ON THE NEXT SLIDE WE'LL GO TO THE LAST POINT. SO OVER THELAST COUPLE OF YEARS O LEGAL THIS IS JUST THE LAST TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS IS A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. TO TRY TO EXPAND CIVIL COMMITMENT LAWS EITHER EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF GRAVE DISABILITY. OR BROADENING THE CIVIL COMMITMENT CRITERIA OR CHANGING CONSERVATIVE SHIP CRITERIA- AND THOSE ARE ALL CONTINUING TO BE INTRODUCED TODAY. OF THE STATE AUDITOR ALL ALSO WHY NO GOING TO BE SPEAKING LATERON FOUND IN A JULY TWENTY TWENTY REVIEW OF LPS THAT THERE WAS NOT EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY EXPANDING. CREATURES I'M HAPPY DAVID STEPS TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS LEWIS WE IF IT'S OKAY WE LIKE TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS PANEL SO IF YOU DON'T MIND STICKING WITH US WE'D WE'D LOVE TO HAVE TO THAT THAT. IS THAT OKAY.

WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST WHICH IS- KOREA SHE TO WITH THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. A GOOD MORNING TO THE COMMITTEES- MY NAME IS COREY SHEET OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THERE SHOULD BE A HAND OUT IN YOUR PACKETS WHICH WILL FORM THE BASIS OF ELLY ELLS REMARKS TODAY- JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS HAND OUT IS. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE SHOULD ANYONE TUNING INTO THIS HEARING WANT TO ACCESS IT- OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN- OVERVIEW OF WHAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT- AS I'LL GET INTO IN A LITTLE BIT- DETERMINING SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THE LPS ACT. IS A VERY COMPLEX EXERCISE AND IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT- THAT SAID WE DO KNOW OF BROADER FUND SOURCES THAT. CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT THE ACT- AND THE MAJOR TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH THE ACT IS IMPLEMENTED AND WE WILL BE MAKING NOTE OF THESE IN THE PRESENTATION- SO TURNING BRIEFLY TO PAGE ONE. OF OUR HAND OUT I'LL PROVIDE A SHORT ROAD MAP FOR OUR PRESENTATION TODAY- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS- FUNDING FOR THE ACT. IS SPREAD. ACROSS THE SYSTEM OF CARE CONSISTING OF A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES AND FUND SOURCES. AND GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLEXITY ALL FIRST START THE PRESENTATION BY. PROVIDING SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS ABOUT FUNDING FOR THE L. P. S. ACTIVE SYSTEM OF CARE. AFTER THAT I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF RUNDOWN OF MAJOR TOUCH POINTS WE'VE IDENTIFIED- AT WHICH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT OCCURS. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT AVAILABLE FUNDING AT EACH OF THESE TOUCH POINTS. BOB SO TURNING TWO PAGES TWO AND THREE OF OUR HAND OUT- ALL NOW GET INTO- ARE KEY TAKE AWAYS ABOUT FUNDING FOR THE LPS ACTS SYSTEM OF CARE. THE FIRST KEY TAKE AWAY IS THAT ASSESSING FUNDING FOR THE LPS ACT IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT THE LPS ACTED IN ENACT A SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO BE FUNDED IT RATHER CREATED A SYSTEM FOR INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT STATEWIDE- IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT OCCURS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS INCLUDING OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM- AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENTITIES INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT CAN CONDUCT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. IN ADDITION EACH OF THESE ENTITIES HAS DISTINCT FUND SOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL- THAT THEY CAN USE FOR LPS ACT RELATED PURPOSES ASSESSING FUNDING FOR THE ACT. IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS TO SPECIFICALLY TO IMPLEMENT THE LPS ACT- SPENDING ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT GENERALLY COMES FROM BROADER FUND SOURCES THAT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES- ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE HERE ARE THE VARIOUS POTS OF- FUNDING THAT COUNTIES HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO FUND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- FURTHERMORE WHEN SPENDING DOES OCCUR. FROM THESE BROADER POTS OF FUNDING IT IS- GENERALLY NOT TRACKED AS DIRECTLY FOR LPS ACT IMPLEMENTATION- AND SO THIS MAKES IT ULTIMATELY UNCLEAR WHAT SPECIFIC SHARE OF THESE BROADER FUND SOURCES ARE ULTIMATELY SPENT ON LPS ACT RELATED ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY- OUR NEXT KEY TAKE AWAY. IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT INVOLVES A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES TYPICALLY THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT- ARE DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS ON LPS HOLD OR CONSERVATORSHIP- BUT THIS IS JUST ONE PART OF THE WHOLE PICTURE AS- THEIR ALSO FOR EXAMPLE- MENTAL HEALTH. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO CONNECT FOLKS WITH- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BEFORE THE POINT WHERE THEY EVER REACH THE NEED TO BE PLACED ON AN LPS HOLD OR CONSERVATORSHIP- THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE HOUSING THAT- CAN SUPPORT SORT OF THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF FOLKS THAT ARE UNDER AN LPS CONSERVATORSHIP- AND THEY'RE ALSO ADMINISTRATIVE CASE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON AN LPS CONSERVATORSHIP- WHICH ARE TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS. OF WHICH I'LL DISCUSS LATER IN THE PRESENTATION AS WELL- AND FINALLY OUR LAST KEY TAKE AWAY IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT OCCURS- EACH OF THESE TOUCH POINTS MAY INVOLVE THE- A DIFFERENT ENTITY WITH ITS OWN. YOU KNOW SPECIFIC FUND SOURCES THAT IT CAN DRAW ON FOR LPS RELATED ACTIVITIES- AND AGAIN THESE BROAD THESE FUNDS SOURCES ARE BROAD IN NATURE YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SPECIFIC FUNDING. THAT IS SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT- FOR THE NEXT PART OF OUR PRESENTATION ALL PROVIDE BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR TOUCH POINTS- WE'VE IDENTIFIED WHERE THE LPS ACT IS IMPLEMENTED. AND ALSO DESCRIBE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT FUNDING FOR EACH OF THOSE TOUCH POINTS- SO TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF OUR HAND OUT- THE FIRST LPS ACT TOUCH POINT I'LL DISCUSS OUR THE PREVENTATIVE OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY- COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THESE INCLUDE OUTREACH EFFORTS TO LINK INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WITH PROGRAMS- ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. IN ESSENCE THESE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE INTENDED TO HELP CONNECT PEOPLE WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF. BEING PLACED ON LPS HOLD WITH SERVICES TO HELP PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING- NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS THAT THESE OTREACH ACTIVITIES- CAN RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT INCLUDE YOU KNOW ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT WHICH WAS JUST- DISCUSSED BY THE- ANALYST IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ME. OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS- AND BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE- INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF BEING PLACED ON LPS HOLD. IN TERMS OF FUNDINGFOR THESE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES YOUR COUNTIES MAKE USE OF SEVERAL OF THEIR BROADER POTS OF FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH YOU KNOW THESE INCLUDE NINETEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS- FEDERAL GRANTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND AS AVAILABLE YOU KNOW SORT OF THEIR OWN. RESOURCES GENERALLY THESE OUTREACH TYPE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MEDICAID REIMBURSABLE AND SO- FED FUNDS OBTAINED THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TYPICALLY DON'T SUPPORT THESE THESE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES HAND OUT- THE NEXT MAJOR TOUCH POINT- DISCUSS ARE THE DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE. TO PEOPLE ON LPS HOLDER ON A CONSERVATORSHIP- THESE CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS OR THERAPEUTIC COUNSELLING- NOTABLY SOME PATIENTS- SOME LPS PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS- AND IN THESE CASES THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE COST OF CARE. FOR THOSE PATIENTS- IN TERMS OF FINDING YOU KNOW AGAIN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DON'T RECEIVE SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THE L. P. S. ACT- AS WITH THE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER- THEY DRAWN BROADER FUND SOURCES INCLUDING THEIR REALIGNMENT DOLLARS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AHLERS- FEDERAL FUNDS OBTAINED THROUGH MEDIC CAL FOR DIRECT SERVICES- AND ADDITIONAL FEDERAL GRANTS FOR- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BROADLY- WHEN IT COMES TO LPS SPECIFICALLY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CAN DRAW. ON OF THESE BROADER FUND SOURCES FOR DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WITH ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION WHICH IS THAT- TYPICALLY M. HSA DOLLARS ARE NOT ARE NOT USED FOR SORT OF INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT- OF THE FUND SOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM YOU KNOW WE HAVE HEARD THAT COUNTY'S PREDOMINANTLY USE THEIR NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS TO FIND DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE ON MLPS HOLD OR ON A CONSERVATORSHIP- BUT AGAIN THIS FUNDING IS NOT EXPLICITLY TRACKED AS FOR LPS- FOLKS ON LPS HOLDER UNDER A CONSERVATORSHIP- THIS IS JUST- ONE SLICE OF THE OVERALL PICTURE BUT WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH COUNTY SPEND- ON LPS PATIENTS RECEIVING CARE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS- IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN COUNTY REIMBURSEMENTS- FUNDED LPS TREATMENT IN STATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES- NOTABLY THIS AMOUNT HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER TIME- WITH COUNTY REIMBURSEMENTS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- REFLECTING ROUGHLY A 50% INCREASE OVER THE TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN LEVEL- I SHOULD ALSO JUST MAKE MENTION THAT THERE WERE- A COUPLE OF MAJOR. INVESTMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ACT WHICH- HAVE SOME INTERACTION WITH SORT OF THE L. P. S. POPULATION- SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN- ARE ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO- CONTRACT. OUT FOR ADDITIONAL BEDS IN THE COMMUNITY SETTING- AND- THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED- ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND ROUGHLY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE TO EXPAND- IN IN THE FORM OF GRANT FUNDING FOR LOCALS TO SORT OF EXPAND- BED CAPACITY IN IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS- I SHOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW THESE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET CAN SORT OF IMPACT FOLKS THAT ARE ON AN LPS HOLDER A CONSERVATORSHIP BUT- FUNDING IN THOSE- PROGRAMS THAT WERE ENACTED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ISN'T SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR THE LPS POPULATION- BUT REGARDLESS- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL BED CAPACITY IN THE COMMUNITY CAN SORT OF PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS- SO TURNING TO PAGE SIX. OF OUR HAND OUT. OF THE NEXT MAJOR TOUCH POINT ALL DISCUSS- OUR ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY- COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND PUBLIC CONSERVATORS- WHILE THERE IS SOME VARIATION BY COUNTY- COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND PUBLIC CONSERVATIVES. ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATING IS ADMINISTRATIVELY MANAGING- AND ARRANGING FOR THE SERVICE NEEDS OF. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON LPS CONSERVATORSHIP SO- IN TERMS OF FUNDING- THERE IS NO DEDICATED STATE FUNDING PROVIDED TO SUPPORT COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND PUBLIC CONSERVATORS- AS A RESULT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AT THIS TOUCH POINT ARE 1100% COUNTY FUNDED- HOWEVER THE SERVICES THAT PUBLIC GUARDIANS HELPED. ARRANGE FOR THEIR CLIENTS CAN BE PAID FOR BY A VARIETY OF FUN SOURCES- THESE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE- FUNDING FOR BOARDING CARE HOUSING THAT- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MAY HAVE ACCESS TO- OR EVEN HEALTH INSURANCE INCLUDING- WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. FOR DIRECT- FOR DIRECT TREATMENT SERVICES- FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD THAT- MEDIC CAL BILLING FOR TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- IS FACILITATED BY BY COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S- HOWEVER WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THE CLIENTS SERVED BY THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS DO NOT HAVE HEALTH COVERAGE- ONE THING TO NOTE- HERE ON THE SORT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF SERVICES. IS THAT PEOPLE ON LPS HOLDS CONSERVATORSHIP I DO NOT HAVE GUARANTEED SPOTS IN PROGRAMS SUCH AS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- THAT CAN HELP SORT OF PAY FOR THEIR SERVICE NEEDS IF THERE IS ALTERNATELY DIFFICULTY WITH GETTING AN INDIVIDUAL ON. A CONSERVATORSHIP PLACED- IN AN APPROPRIATE SUPPORTIVE PROGRAM- AND THEN- IN SOME CASES AN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN INCOME OR THEIR FAMILY'S INCOME MAY HAVE TO SORT OF HELP SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS INCLUDING THEIR HOUSING NEEDS- YEAH WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY THAT- CLIENTS OF COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS YOU KNOW MANY OF THEM ARE ON SSI AND SORT OF RELY ON. THAT INCOME TO HELP MEET THEIR NEEDS. FINALLY ARE TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN OF OUR HAND OUT I'LL BRIEFLY DISCUSS OUR FINAL MAJOR TOUCH POINT THE COURT SYSTEM. AS WELL AS SOME OTHER TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH YOU KNOW FUNDING MAY IMPACT PEOPLE- ON LPS HOLDER UNDER A CONSERVATORSHIP- FOR LPS. INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY ENGAGE WITH THE COURT SYSTEM AFTER AN INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOUR SHORT TERM HOLD WHILE IT'S BEING DETERMINED THAT- WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR AN EXTENDED HOLD OR OR CONSERVATORSHIP- AS AS WAS DISCUSSED ON. BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER ON THIS ON THIS PANEL- THE COURTS ARE VARIETY OF FUNDED BY A VARIETY OF FUN SOURCES THAT ARE NOTED IN OUR HAND OUT- BUT AGAIN SIMILAR TO SORT OF THE OTHER FUND SOURCES THAT I'VE NOTED EARLIER THIS PRESENTATION- SPECIFIC COURT COSTS FOR LPS. RELATED ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY IS NOT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY TRACKED AS AS SO. OTHER TOUCH POINTS THAT SORT OF IMPACT THE LPS SYSTEM OF CARE INCLUDE- LAW ENFORCEMENT- PARTICULARLY FOR- INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOUR LPS HOLDS- PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICES- AND EVEN HOSPITALS WHERE- INDIVIDUAL STAY WHILE THEY'RE SORT OF ON AN INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. ON EACH OF THESE ENTITIES COMES YOU KNOW WITH ITS OWN SORT OF FIND SOURCES- AND SIMILARLY YOU KNOW THEY'D THEY'D SORT OF DO NOT TRACK- FUNDING FOR LPS RELATED ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY- SO JUST TO SUM UP AND CIRCLE BACK ON OUR ARE A KEY TAKE AWAYS. ASSESSING FUNDING FOR THE LPS ACT IS VERY COMPLEX AND- VERY COMPLEX GIVEN SORT OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT OCCURS THE WIDE VARIETY AND THE WIDE VARIETY OF FUND SOURCES THAT- DATA CAN BE USED TO SORT OF COME. SUPPORT VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE ACT- AND YOU KNOW GENERALLY ADDING TO THIS COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING SPECIFIC FUNDING AMOUNTS IS THE FACT THAT FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE ACT. TYPICALLY COMES FROM BROADER POTS OF FUNDING THAT I CAN BE USED FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL AS THERE ARE NO DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS TO SUPPORT THE AXE THE CIVICALLY- AND WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE OUR PRESENTATION AND AT THE END OF THIS PANEL BE HAPPY TO TAKE. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS MATERIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD PANELIST- JANELLE E. TWO OR L. DIVISION CHIEF BLOCKS INCIDENTS CERTIFICATION FOR DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES- APPEARING. ON THE SCREEN TO YOUR LEFT MEMBERS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS JANELLE EACH OVERALL AND I AM. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME THEM YES THANK YOU. OKAY GREAT. SO AGAIN GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JANELLE ITO ROLE AND I AM THE DIVISION CHIEF OF LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT DHS'S ROLE IS IN IN OVERSEEING THE LPS. DO YOU SEE AS RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING SUPPORT PROTECTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. BUT IT MENTAL ILLNESS MAY POSE A RISK OF HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTIONS FIVE THOUSAND THROUGH FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX. HSS THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE COUNTY DESIGNATED OPS FACILITIES AND WORKS WITH JOHNNY'S TO ENSURE THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE. WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE. SOME OF THE H. RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE THE APPROVAL A FIFTY ONE FIFTY LBS FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THIS IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDING TO OUR TREATMENT AND EVALUATION HUNDRED LPS ACT AND THE CHILDREN'S CIVIL COMMITMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THE BRIDGE WAS WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. THE EXISTING STATUTE AUTHORIZES DHS TO ESTABLISH REGULATIONS RELATED TO BE APPROVED FOR A FIFTY ONE FIFTY LBS FACILITIES. DESIGNATED BY COUNTY. DHS CLUB STATISTICAL DATA AND MAKES THE DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO MEDICAL LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL GROUPS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS INVOLUNTARILY DETAINED FOR AN EVALUATION AND TREATMENT AND CONSERVATORSHIP. AND WHILE WE ALSO COLLECT THE SPECIFIED INFORMATION REGARDING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO ADMINISTERED. THEM ALSO TREATMENTS OR PSYCHOSURGERY THIS PARTICULAR INFORMATION IS NOT PUBLISHED AND CAN ONLY BE SHARED IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS THE PATIENT'S CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY. ANOTHER COMPONENT OF DHS'S RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE MONITORING CONTRACT WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND RESULT PATIENT'S RIGHTS COMPLAINTS AND MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES SLASH COUNTY DESIGNATED LPS FACILITIES. IT IS RESPONSIBILITIES ALSO INCLUDE FACILITATING THE RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS CONDUCTED BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DHS MONITORS MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES ARE COUNTY DESIGNATED APPEARS TO STILL AT EASE CHANGE YOUR THAT THEY HAVE DISPLAYED PATIENCE RIGHTS HANDBOOKS AND POSTERS AND PROVIDE THAT HANDBOOKS TO PATIENTS UP ON- WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVING TREATMENT IN THESE FACILITIES. YES YES I'M SURE THAT THE POSTERS ARE VISIBLE AND- ARE CHECKING FOR THESE WHILE WE ARE CONDUCTING COMPLAINTS VISITS WALKERS- ENSURING THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND ALSO REVIEWING THE FACILITY'S ADMISSIONS CRITERIA AS TO ENSURE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE BEING GIVEN A HANDBOOK. YES THIS IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROPAGATION OF REGULATIONS TO ENSURE LPS FACILITIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF LPS ACT. WELL THERE'S NO SPECIFIC LPS LICENSE IN ORDER TO BE AN LPS DESIGNATED FACILITY AND MUST BEING ONE OF THE FOLLOWING. A CDPH ARE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSED ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL A GENERAL ACUTE CARE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL OR SKILLED NURSING NURSING FACILITY WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT. AND THOSE ALL FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. THE OTHER OPTION IS TO BE- A DH CS LICENSE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION CENTER. OR A DH CS OR COUNTY CERTIFIED CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. CURRENTLY THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE EXISTING STATUTES REPORT DATA TO DH CS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS EACH LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AND EACH FACILITY PROVIDING SERVICES TO PERSONS UNDER THE LPS ACT MUST PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION RECORDS AND REPORTS WHICH DH CS DEEMS NECESSARY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF OVERSIGHT OF THE LPS OCT. HOWEVER DH CS DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY PATIENT IDENTIFIERS. THE INDIVIDUAL FACILITY IS REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THEIR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOSE RIGHTS WERE DENIED AND THE RIGHTS OR RIGHTS WHICH WERE DENIED. THIS INFORMATION IS THEN PROVIDED TO DH CS QUARTERLY THE CONTENT OF THE REPORTS FROM THE SAUDIS ENABLE THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AND DH CS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT RECORDS IF NECESSARY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION. THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT PUBLISHED OUR PUBLIC SINCE THIS WOULD BE IN RELATION TO APOSTLE PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATION. I'M IT IS A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION AND THE REPORTS AND DATA THAT ARE PART OF THE RIVER- GIVE ME THAT. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THIS INFORMATION IS NOT- A PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF REPORTING- INFORMATION UNDER THE LPS OCT. SIMILAR TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS JUST STATED THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO CONVULSIVE TREATMENT OR PSYCHOSURGERY. DATA AND INFORMATION THAT IS SUBMITTED BY DOCTOR FACILITY TO THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR IS REQUIRED TO BE SENT TO DH CS. THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND DATA INCLUDES THE NUMBER OF PERSON TO RECEIVE TREATMENTS WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES. INVOLUNTARY PATIENTS WHO GAVE INFORMED CONSENT. INVOLUNTARY PATIENTS ÓRDENES AND CAPABLE OF GIVING INFORMED CONSENT AND RECEIVE COMPULSIVE TREATMENTS AGAINST HER WILL. BUDGET PATIENTS WHO GAVE INFORMED CONSENT. INVOLUNTARY PATIENTS DEEMED INCAPABLE OF GIVING CONSENT. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS REPORT TO DHS THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO RECEIVED TREATMENTS WHATEVER ADMINISTERED IN THE SAME FOUR CATEGORIES. ONCE THE INFORMATION AND DATA IS RECEIVED DHS WILL FORWARD TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA ANY RECORDS OR INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THESE REPORTS THAT MAY INDICATE A VIOLATION BY PHYSICIAN- IN. VIOLATION OF THE LPS ACT A LAW OR REGULATION. FOR FACILITIES AND PHYSICIANS ADMINISTER PERFORM CONVULSIVE TREATMENT INSULIN COMA TREATMENT OR PREFRONTAL SONIC TREATMENT INVOLVING CALLING DIRECT STIMULATION OF CELLS OR TISSUE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AND DATA IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED THESE TREATMENTS DURING THE PRIOR QUARTER OR WHICH CANCERS SUCH TREATMENT THAT'S A PART OF THE FACILITIES PROGRAM REPORT THIS INFORMATION TO THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR. THESE REPORTS ARE REQUIRED EVEN IF THESE TREATMENT METHODS WERE NOT USED DURING THE QUARTER. ADDITIONALLY ANY PHYSICIAN CONSIDERS ANY OF THESE METHODS A SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE AND HIS USE OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TREATMENT METHODS IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY FACILITIES REPORT MUST ADMIT ACCORDING TO REPORTS OF LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR. THESE REPORTS ARE REQUIRED EVEN IF THESE TREATMENTS WERE NOT ADMINISTERED DURING THAT. THAT PARTICULAR QUARTER. THESE REPORTS CAN BE PROVIDED IF REQUESTED BY THE PUBLIC HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE SAME DATA THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE. SECTION FIFTY FOUR OH TWO. ADDITIONAL QUARTERLY DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ALSO EXIST FOR FACILITIES AND PHYSICIANS THAT PERFORM PSYCHOSURGERY. PREFRONTAL SONIC TREATMENT INVOLVING DESTRUCTION OF CELLS OR TISSUE. VISIBILITIES AND PHYSICIANS MUST SUBMIT TO THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR A REPORT OF ALL SUCH PROCEDURES ACTUALLY PERFORMED DURING THE PRECEDING QUARTER CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS TYPE OF PSYCHOSURGERY PERFORMED. DAY SURGERY PERFORMED AND COMPLICATIONS THAT AROSE DURING OR AFTER COMPLETING PSYCHOSURGERY IF APPLICABLE. THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR TRANSMITS COPIES OF ALL QUARTERLY REPORTS TO DH CS BY THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE END OF THE QUARTER CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT REPORTING LPS DATA. DIGEST IS WORKING TO CONTACT COUNTIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REMIND THEM OF THE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT IN AN EFFORT TO PRODUCE CONSISTENT DATA. ULTIMATELY DHS IS COMMITTED TO COLLABORATING WITH COUNTIES IN THE OVERSIGHT OF THE LPS ACT AND SERVING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN NEED OF INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND HERE WITH ME TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS. RESCUE IS THE DIVISION CHIEF OF OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS AT THIS POINT. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START. ANYBODY ANY QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU O MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS LIKE I DID WANT TO ASK AND THIS IS OF CHIEF- ITO OR REAL. PAGE TEN AND YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IT TALKS ABOUT THE REPORTS AND THE FACT THAT. MORE THAN 50% OF THE COUNTIES. DO NOT PROVIDE ACCURATE. INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LPS DETENTIONS AND IT GOES ON TO DESCRIBE HOW SOME OF THE PROVIDE NO INFORMATION SOME OF IT IS INACCURATE INCOMPLETE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PARAGRAPH ON PAGE TEN IS IT SAID THAT THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES TO COUNTIES WHO FAIL TO EITHER REPORT DATA OR PROVIDE INCOMPLETE DATA. WHAT DO WE DO TO CORRECT THIS. HUESO CURRENTLY LIKE I SAID BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXISTING CONSEQUENCE- BUT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR COUNTIES TO REPORT SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE AT DH CS LOOKING TO DO IS TO BUILD BETTER COMMUNICATION COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTIES WE ARE GOING BACK AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION WE ALSO ARE LOOKING AT INTERNALLY ARE WE HAVING ANY ISSUES WITH OUR REPORTING MECHANISMS. MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS AN F. YOU KNOW SOMETHING OCCURRING INTERNALLY WITH THE REPORTING SYSTEM SO WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THAT. THEIR- ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING FORWARD THAT WE WANT TO IMPROVE ON AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. USING THE SAME DATA WE WANT TO GET BETTER ACCURATE MORE DATA SO AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. SO I. I'M SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR POLICYMAKERS AND TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED. AND WHETHER OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING. SO IF THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES AND FOR YEARS YOU ALL HAVE TRIED TO THEM OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT I THINK IS. WHAT YOU HAD SAID AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN PERHAPS NOW THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT REPORTING. AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS POLICYMAKERS WE THEN CAN INCLUDE. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THAT IS A ONE OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES. I WOULD WHAT I WANT TO JUMP INTO I'M JUST TO. RESTATE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY AT DH THE PAST FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES- SO LIKE CHEN I WAS STATING WORDS WERE USING ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN. TO ASSIST COUNTY SWEAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON BUT UNLESS WE HAVE SOME SORT OF A BROADER AUTHORITY FOR CONSEQUENCES AND THEN JUST ALSO TO AND RELATE BACK THAT THERE IS NO. FUNDING TIED TO LPS COUNTIES ARE USING DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES BUT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE. A PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCE FOR LPS AND SO THEY'RE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS EACH YES TO COLLECT THIS DATA LIKE CHANNEL. HAS BEEN REFERENCING ONCE AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A IN FORTY DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER KIND OF CONSEQUENCES FOR DATA. THAT IS NOT PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT. BUT YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE DAY COLLECTION IS EXTREME IMPORTANT ORCHARD IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO NEXT. WEEK WE CAN'T EVALUATE IN LESS WE KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING. AND IT TO HELP YOU HELP CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL ISSUES. WE DO NEED TO COLLECT THE DATA. YEAH SO WE DEFINITELY AGREE THAT YOU KNOW HAVING THE MOST ACCURATE DATA FOR ANY SORT OF PROGRAM FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS IMPORTANT I AM I DO JUST WANT TO ALSO MENTION THE DEPARTMENT HAS. BEEN UNDERTAKING A VERY LARGE A PROJECT TO. INCREASE OUR DATA COLLECTION INEFFICIENCY CALLED OUR PAPER HEALTH DATA MODERNIZATION- THIS IS ONE COMPONENT OF THAT- SO I JUST ALSO WANTED TO SAY WERE DOING SHORT TERM EFFORTS LIKE CHEN I WAS MENTIONING THAT WE ALSO DO HAVE A LONG RANGE PLAN- FOR ALL OF OUR PAPER HEALTH. THANK YOU. THIS SEGMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY IF I HAVEN'T SAID IT YET BUT THANK YOU TO BOTH CHEERS FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AS WELL AS FOR ALLOWING ME TO ATTEND- I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AND I AND I THINK I WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER AND THEN JUST MENTION THAT THE CRISIS THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE WE'VE ALL BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR AS LONG AS MOST OF US HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS DIET CONTINUES TO- TO INVOLVE. AND WILL THIS HEARING IS IMPORTANT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE EVEN CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE A SPECIAL SESSION TO DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS NOT JUST LPS BUT THE OVERALL- OUR STATE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME I THINK WE I THINK BY WHAT IS VERY EVIDENT STE- AND WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF RESOURCES BEEN GOING INTO THE SYSTEM ESPECIALLY THIS LAST COUPLE YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN HISTORICALLY OVER FUNDED. I THINK IT IS NOW THE TIME THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH OUT AND YOU KNOW REPORTED FRAUD ND IN OTHER AGENCIES NOT NOT ANY OF THESE BUT THAT IS A GOOD TIME JUST TO REALLY MONITOR ALL OF THAT FUNDING THAT'S GOING OUT AND TO REALLY BE ABLE TO SIFT THROUGH- OUR CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HOW WE MOST EFFECTIVELY GO FORWARD AND SOMETIMES THAT'S HARDER TO DO I'M JUST IN A REGULAR SESSION WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING ON WE ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT BILLS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOLAR WE TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS ALL THE SAME TIME. SO THAT SAID- JUST HISTORICALLY SO WE FACED OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND HELP ME REMEMBER BUT I IT WAS BEFORE I ARRIVED SO I THINK THAT WAS LIKE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN WE FACED OUT GOING TO THIS NEW SYSTEM AT THE BROWN NOT NOT THE SAME TIME- THAT LPS AND EVERYTHING WAS ESTABLISHED BUT THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OCCURRED WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS COMMUNITY RESOURCE AS WE PHASE OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH NOW WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER KIND. OF SOME OF THAT OVERALL MONITORING. OF THE FIRST. AND A THE SAME TIME WE KNOW WE HAVE THE- OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THAT IS DOING THE LICENSING A LOT OF THOSE FACILITIES. AND SO FOR ME I MEAN RIGHT THERE THERE THERE BECOMES A GAP RIGHT BECAUSE I CAN TALK TO FACILITIES ABOUT. AND WE NEED MORE RIGHT WE NEED. I THINK WHAT HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR- AND WHAT I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND AS WE DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE YET. IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY- IN LOCKED FACILITIES AND IN ANY KIND OF CONTINUE. CARE AS THEY COME IN AND OUT. OF THAT WE NEED TO AFFECT THAT THAT UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT BUT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BECAUSE I I'VE TALKED WITH PEOPLE RECENTLY ABOUT THEIR WAITING A YEAR FOR SOMETHING TO GET LICENSED AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE DOING THE OVERSIGHT OF THINGS AFTER THEIR LICENSE SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS BETWEEN YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO LICENSING- BOTH LOCKED AND RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES- IN THE SUBJECT. CAN YOU JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT PART AND THEN JUST HISTORICALLY ALL OF THIS EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAS COME WITH THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IT DID YOU SEE ALL THIS COMMON. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I AM YES AGAIN SO WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT ARE LICENSED BY OUR DEPARTMENTS SO SPECIFICALLY AGAIN THE HOPE REALLY THE HOSPITALS TYPE SETTINGS ARE LICENSED BY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES THEY ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN A MENTAL HEALTH CERTIFICATION FROM OUR DEPARTMENT OR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL AND THEY DO SEEK THAT SO THERE IS SOME OVERSIGHT BY BOTH OF OUR DEPARTMENTS AND- WE BOTH KIND OF. COLLABORATIVE COLLABORATIVE WORK TOGETHER SO DHS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING TO OTHER TYPES OF FACILITIES WHICH AGAIN ARE THE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION CENTERS AND SO WITH THAT THEN THEY'RE ALSO KIND OF THE DESIGNATIONS THAT COME WITH THAT LIKE THE OPS DESIGNATIONS WHICH DH CS DOES DO THOSE- THERE IS ALSO THAT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AT DH CS- WILL PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE IN AND- AND WITH THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL SO THERE ARE THERE'S MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH KIND OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. I MEAN IN THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD AN OBSERVATION THAT THAT WHAT YOU DESCRIBE SEEMS A LITTLE BIT FRAGMENTED. I JUST WANT TO ADD IN TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT DID WE SEE THIS COMING AND YOU'RE CORRECT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND A FORMER DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAMS MERGED INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THAT WAS DONE TO FOSTER. INTEGRATION OF SERVICES% AND CARE ON FOR INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SUFFER WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION ALSO HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND SO SINCE NOT MERGING INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IT PUTS THE MAJORITY OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR. ALL SERVICES UNDER ONE AUTHORITY AND SELL THAT HOUSE MAJORITY DH CS NOW BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF AUTHORITY. FOR LICENSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES ALSO AS THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY AROUND MEDICAID AND IT ALSO IS THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY. OR FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION FUNDS. AND SO THE INTEGRATION HAS REALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE SERVICES I'M FOR INDIVIDUALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- FOR LPS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. IN ADDITION TO OTHER. FOLKS THAT ARE SERVED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HE OKAY. THANK YOU I'VE GOT ABOUT A LINE HERE SAID HANG ON TO SECOND MR SANTIAGO. BUT WE WILL. YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP FIRST. MISTER MISTER STONE THANK. I THINK THAT'S THE INTERPRETATION FOR THE APARTMENT. WHAT IS SINCE WE'VE EXPANDED THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR. FOUR IN THE AREA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND WITH A LICENSING BACKLOG. BY CATEGORY OR BY JUST IN AGGREGATE FOR WHAT THE REQUESTS ARE FROM THE COUNTIES TO. BE ABLE TO GET LICENSED AND WHAT'S THAT THE AVERAGE TIMELINE FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO GET FACILITIES LICENSE. OKAY SO CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG WITHIN OUR MENTAL HEALTH LICENSING SECTION FOR ANY FACILITIES RE SPEAKING AS PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY LICENSE OR MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION- CENTER LICENSE. SO ONCE WE DO RECEIVING APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WE ARE VERY RESPONSIVE AND DON'T CARRY A BACKLOG FOR THOSE FACILITIES. DO YOU KNOW IF THAT'S THE SAME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. I KNOW I PERSONALLY I'M NOT AWARE. HE'S HE SAID- I WAS GONNA JUMP IN HERE BECAUSE I WANT AS COME A FOLLOW UP TO THAT YOU SAID THAT THE PARTY HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OR OR- MERRILEES MAY HAVE SAID THAT- FOR THE BULK OF THE LICENSING WHAT. WHAT IS THE BALK MAIN 75% EIGHTY PERCENT- CAN YOU GIVE US A ROUGH IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS. SO AGAIN WE FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND REHABILITATION CENTERS AND ARE PSYCHIATRIC HELP FACILITIES- WE ARE THE SOLE AUTHORITY FOR LICENSING THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES AND THEN AGAIN ON OUR AS OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE WE ARE THE SOLE AUTHORITY FOR LICENSING IN THE RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT FACILITIES. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL FOR **** MR SANTIAGO YEAH. I AM TAKING THIS CHAIR- AND I GUESS I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING BECAUSE- AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO TRY TO IMPROVE THIS SO. YOU KNOW WE DID NOT A COUPLE YEARS AGO OF THE L. A. COUNTY AND SOME OF HIS PROGRAMS WE FOUND SOME SOME GAPS- IN TERMS OF WHEN SOMEBODY IS BROUGHT IN FOR HELP AT THE HELP WASN'T THERE IN SOME CASES. AND THERE WAS MONEY LEFT OVER CAN I REALIZE THAT YOU IT'S NOT APPLES TO ORANGES BUT I GUESS I STRUGGLE FOR. HADA IN ANOTHER THIS IS WHAT THIS HEARING IS ABOUT BUT- AND YOU MENTIONED THE DATA COLLECTION THAT IS IN PART. BY STRUGGLE IN ALL THIS HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DIFFERENT FILTER HOLDEN ON BEING VETERAN OKAY UP ONE FIFTY ONE AM IT WILL FLOORS LA WE HAVE. LETTERMAN ACT IN ALL IS TO PHASE TO BRING THAT PERSON AND TRY TO HELP THEM AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE IN ABOUT THE- CONSERVATORSHIP. THERE'S NO FUNDS FOR CONSERVATORSHIP- ORAL PS AND WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE LAYERS AND LAYERS OF THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN AND I'M NOT PLACING BLAME ANYWHERE IT'S JUST THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS ONCE IT'S BEEN CREATED. THAT LOOK IT'S LOSS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO REALLY DESPERATELY. NEEDS HELP. A. N. N. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH. TRYING TO PUSH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ON THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO REALLY. I ONCE A SIMPLIFIED RIGHT BUT MAYBE MAYBE. CRAIG A MORE DIRECT WAY OF HELPING. THIS INDIVIDUAL- GOOD EVEN IF WE HAD THE DATA THAT'S GOING TO TELL US THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORKING THE WAY SHOULD BE- EVEN IF WE HAD THE ENFORCEMENT. WE WEEK WE CAN ENFORCE. DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LARGER PART SERVICES. THERE'S OT TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT AND I'M STRUGGLING FOR TO HELP I'LL PUSH IT THAT THAT HELPED CREATE THAT SERVICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE AN ALLEY CAT IT WILL BE FOUND AT THIS A COUPLE YEARS OLD INFORMATION SO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT RECENT INFORMATION BUT WHEN WE DID. THE AUDIT. WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS HOLDING ON TO. A LITTLE OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLARS A AND M. FHA DOLLARS RIGHT NOT THAT THOSE COULD BE VERY CRITICAL TO HELPING PEOPLE- WHAT WHAT WHEN WONDER HELD EITHER ON THE LETTERMAN ACT LAURA LAURA'S LAW OR ONE FIFTY ONE OR WHAT HAVE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THAT ONCE A PERSON IS THERE AND THEY NEED HELP. WHAT WHAT IS THERE FOR THEM RIGHT NOW I'M I'M INTERESTED IN SORT OF. YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING BECAUSE AND I'M TALKING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AIRLINE GROUP REPRESENTS COULD ROLL. WHERE DO THESE CONVERSATIONS BECOME VERY EMOTIONAL FOR PEOPLE. BECAUSE OF THE AUTOMATIC THING THAT THEY THINK ABOUT IS WE'RE GONNA GO TAKE AWAY SOMEBODY CIVIL RIGHTS NOT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WAS COMING FROM THIS IS COMING FROM. WALKING THE STREETS AND SEEING SOMEBODY WHO DESPERATELY NEEDS HELP BANG IN THEIR HEAD UP AGAINST THE WALL OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL THEY PASS OUT. A. N. WHERE THAT. WHERE THE- INTENT IS TO HELP THEM NOT. DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR LIBERTY THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE IT'S DESPERATE. AND WE SEE THIS. IT DAY IN DAY OUT. NO PEOPLE NO T. THIRTY YEARS A BLEEDING LEGS ARE THIS BIG. AND IT'S PAINFUL TO SEE THEIRS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS. TO HELP THAT PERSON. AND I DON'T I DON'T A LOT OUT THERE BUT- BUT I WONDER IF YOU CAN COMMENT TO THAT NIGHT AND I REALLY THAT THAT THAT'S A BIG QUESTION- FOR VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW BUT- BUT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT PARTICULAR PIECE. ABOUT THAT ACTUAL SERVICE FOR PEOPLE. A MOMENT BOOM WHAT NEED TO CHANGE. CAN START WITH THE RESPONSE AND THEN IF ANY OTHER PANEL MEMBERS WANT TO JUMP AND I'M JUST AND TO YOUR QUESTION AROUND WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS IS EVERYTHING SO WITH THE SYSTEM OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM. I WE TO PUBLISHED REPORTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE ANNUALLY AND FOR ON 200-018-2000 NINETEEN THE REPORT ON THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN COURT INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE CERTAIN TWELVE COUNTIES- AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SIX THAT'S FOUND IN REDUCING HOMELESSNESS HOSPITALIZATIONS INCARCERATIONS- ENTER YOUR POINTS OUT INTO. SOME OF THE OTHER TESTIFIED AT THE FINE FOLKS TODAY- THE FUNDS THAT WERE USED FOR THAT ARE PRIMARILY THE IMAGES THEY DLLARS ON THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOWED TO BE UTILIZED FOR PROGRAMS LIKE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. ON IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS THERE ARE FOLKS- YOU KNOW WITH LPS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY CAN START AN EMPTY SPOT THERE ARE- SOME SUCCESSES THERE SO I DO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- AND THEN ALSO JUST WHEN I TURN IT OVER CHAT ON THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS. IF THEY WANT TO COMMENT. YEAH THIS IS KIM THE NASH FLOOD AND TO MAKE A KNOWLEDGE. HONEST MEMBER. THE POINT THAT THERE'S A VERY FRAGMENTED BEER HALL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA- WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT PAPERS LIKE MEDICAID AND- EVEN THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE CARVED OUT. FROM MANAGEMENT FROM THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT ALSO MAKES THAT. TRANSITION MORE ON CHALLENGING AND THEN VARIOUS- THERE SHOULDN'T BE A LOT OF UNINSURED PEOPLE LEFT IN IN THIS WORLD WITH THE ACA HAVING EXPANDED MEDICAID. AND SO A LOT OF I THINK THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID IF THEY'RE OVER INCOMES AND- CERTAINLY THEY'RE MORE CHALLENGES GETTING IN THERE AND SHOULD PRIVATE INSURANCE TO PAY FOR- SOME OF THESE SERVICES BUT- I DO BELIEVE THE REAL SOLUTION. AS WE TALK ABOUT IT IS BALLS TWO THINGS ONE IS- TO EXPAND ON I THINK WHAT THE IMAGES THEY PROMISED IN ITS- INITIAL- SORT OF PROPAGANDA AROUND DEVELOPING THEM- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS THAT. THERE ARE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS LIKE AB THIRTY AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THAT WERE REALLY THE MODEL FOR IT IT'S ACIDS. AND THOSE WERE ABOUT. HANNAH PROVIDING THAT REALLY REALLY SPECIFIC SUPPORTIVE MODEL OF GETTING PEOPLE BURST INTO HOUSING AND KEEPING THEIR HOUSING THROUGH A SUPPORT OF INTEGRATED PROGRAM. SO I THINK THOSE ARE MATURE THOSE WERE THERE WAS. ALSO DATA AND LEGISLATIVE RECORD THAT SHOWED HOW EFFECTIVE THAT WAS. IN REDUCING HOSPITALIZATION REDUCING CAR SERRATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO AND SO I THINK THAT IS A REALLY CRITICAL. HE SAID WE NEED TO GET BACK TO ADEQUATELY FUND ADEQUATELY HAVE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE THAT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR SURE. AND THEN THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM REALLY NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED AND EXPANDED THERE IS A CHALLENGE GETTING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES. ACROSS THE STATE SO TO SAY THERE'S DIRT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SERVICES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IS TO BE TRUE AND IT'S. WORSE NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC. SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO THROUGH. GIVE PEOPLE MORE INVOLVED JUVENILE THEY CAN'T SERVICE WHEN THEY NEED THEM A ONE THEM SO I THINK WE REALLY TO ACT PASS CITY BUILD. BEFORE WE LOOK AT SORT OF GOING BACK TO THE APPROACH OF TRYING TO EXPAND THE WAY TO GET PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM THAT DON'T. CURRENTLY A QUOTE WANNABE IN BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE RIGHT PLACE. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY AND THEN DOCTOR REGULAR THE FIRST PANELISTS I BELIEVE MISS MISS LEWIS- ABOUT YOUR PRESENTATION ON THAT THE POLICY THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON THE CONSERVATORSHIP AND THIS THREE COUNTIES BUT BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I CAN CARE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AND ECONOMIC HEARING SEVEN RIGHT MEMBERS HERE- IT'S- IT'S- YEAH THE INTERSECTION THESE ISSUES WE HEAR ON OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE MR SANTIAGO SAID ON A REGULAR BASIS. WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS AND ADDICTION AND NOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME. BUT THERE'S A REAL. INTERSECTION NETWORKS THAT WERE SAYING AND- YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA TO HAVE A SPECIAL SESSION ADDRESSING ALL THOSE ISSUES. AS OUR SENATOR SAID- AND I ALSO NOTE THAT THAT NOT I THANK EVERY SHOULD THE SECOND SPEAKER SAID THAT NOT ALL. ON MENTAL AND LARA'S LAW NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE VIOLENT- IN NOT ALL PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS NEED. ON CONFINEMENT ATTACK TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES BUT- AS MY COLLEAGUE REPRESENTS SKID ROW SAYS HE WALKED ON OUR COMMUNITIES ALL THOUGHT ALL. TAKE YOU CAN TALK TO OUR NEW POLICE CHIEF HERE WHO'S THE CAPTAIN DOWNTOWN. AND WALKED THROUGH CASE THREE AND TEN POINT OUT INDIVIDUALS WHO THEY'RE FREE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. BUT IT'S NOT WORKING FOR THEM THEIR FAMILIES THE COMMUNITY NORTHERN BUSINESSES SO. THE STATUS QUO HAS TO CHANGE THIS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE SO I APPRECIATE THIS HEARING. I DON'T WANT TO JUST DIG IN ON THAT BILL THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY. EIGHTEEN AND I WATCHED IT I PROCEED I WASN'T ON EITHER THE COMMITTEES WERE WENT THROUGH. I THINK I SAID IN ONE DAY SO I DID HEAR THE DEBATE AND I THINK THE FINAL- CONCLUSION WAS IN THOSE THREE COUNTIES. INDIVIDUAL HAD TO BE- CONFINED. NOT CONFINED HAD TO BE. BROUGHT IN BY THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EIGHT TIMES OVER A TWELVE MONTH. PERIOD FOR IT TO TRIGGER- I THINK AT THE TIME THAT SOUNDED LIKE A HIGH NUMBER. HI IT IS IT WORKING I'VE HEARD ANECDOTAL REPORTS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO. ONLY LIKE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY- WORKED WITH AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE TYPE OF THE APPROPRIATE. AMOUNT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR ANALYSIS ON. THE BILL THREE FOUR YEARS LATER- HOW. POLICY IS WORKING AND IS IT EACH THE GOAL THAT WE OUT FOR- I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S WORKING- YOU KNOW THE- PURPOSE OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE SHIPS AS THEY AS I UNDERSTAND THEM WERE A- HOUSING. CONSERVATIVE PILOT SO- I THINK CRITICALLY THE VERY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE HOW IS THE HOUSING COMPONENT OF THAT. IN OTHER WORDS HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE BECAUSE IT'S A BROADER LPS CRITERIA THAT ALLOWS THAT COUNTY CHIU INTERVENING AND DETERMINES UPGRADE TO DISABLE INPUT ON A CONSERVATORSHIP- IN A BROADER WITH A BROADER GREAT DISABILITY STANDARD. ON EVEN THOUGH AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES STOP BY LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD REALLY BE BY ANYONE WE HAVE A VERY EXPENSIVE L. FIFTY ONE FIFTY THIRTY. THAT THE COUNTY CAN AUTHORIZE TECH TEAM PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS COULD BRING SOMEBODY IN TO THE SYSTEM SO. I THINK IT'S IT ISN'T JUST POLICE INVOLVEMENT THERE AS WELL BUT THERE WAS A- IT LEGISLATIVE FINDING RECOMMENDATION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH I HAVE NOT. BEEN ABLE TO FIND BUT I THINK LOOKING AT THAT AND WHAT THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY FINDINGS WERE IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND HOW SUCCESSFUL WAS AND WHAT WAS THE REASON IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IF IT WASN'T AND THEN SECONDLY YOU KNOW THAT. THERE IS ALSO A LEGISLATIVE. RESPONSE TO IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON THAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM IN THOSE PILOTS SO. VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT. IF THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL Y. AND IF THEY WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL WHY NOT I THINK THAT ISTHE REAL KEY QUESTION AND I THINK IT IS ONE THAT STILL OUT THERE- BUT I KNOW THERE WILL BE OTHER PANELIST SPEAKING TO SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. IN SOME OF THOSE VERY COUNTIES WHERE- WE KNOW THAT ACCESS IS BEING VERY DIFFICULT AND EVEN WITH THESE EXPANDED AUTHORITIES TO INVOLUNTARILY TREAT PEOPLE IT HASN'T BEEN IN ITSELF THE SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO. OFFER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. YES I OF A FALL UP QUESTION. IS YOUR RIGHT SO IT'S NOT USING THE TOOL WHAT'S HAPPENING SOMETHING AT THE BACK END BUT MY UNDERSTANDING THEY WOULDN'T UTILIZE THE TOOL OF INVOLUNTARY- A POLICY UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE TO TAKE THE INDIVIDUAL. CELLS ASSUMING THAT IS ACCURATE NEEDS THREE COUNTIES AND THEY DO UTILIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY. DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON ON HIS THAT NUMBER IS THAT THE RIGHT IS THAT NUMBER TOO HIGH ART ARE THESE. ANECDOTAL STORIES ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO AND LESS THAN FIVE PEOPLE HAVING IT TRIGGERED IS THAT ACCURATE AND DOES THAT TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THE NUMBER EIGHT. IS THAT THE WRONG NUMBER. THE PROCESS TO GET PEOPLE INTO THAT SAME PLACE AND ACCEPT THOSE SAME SERVICES AND ALSO BE HOUSE. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT AND SUCCESSFUL MODEL AND WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS ABOUT PATIENT TREATMENT FOR EXAMPLE EVEN AS A NATIONAL- BEING STILL BEING STUDIED THERE ARE NOT THERE'S NOT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS AN IMPACT AND THEN THE INVOLUNTARY COMPONENT OF IT. IS THE SUCCESSFUL PART THERE ARE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE LIKE ASSISTANT- I'M COMMUNITY TREATMENT MODELS THAT DO THAT TENDENCY SUPPORT AND HOUSING SUPPORT THAT. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE NATIONALLY SO I THINK IT'S REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON WHAT IS OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE ON WHAT IS A FACTOR PRACTICE AND WHY DON'T WE DO MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- DOCTOR REGULATE I'VE I JUST I JUST KNOW WE WERE WE HAD A THREE MINUTE HEAD START AND WE ARE NOW FIFTEEN MINUTES BEHIND SO- BUT ANYWAY I THINK I'M NOT TRYING TO DETER YOU IN ANYWAY. JUST TO. BREVITY OR- DIRECT. I WILL- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL START WITH THE FRAMING COMMENT IF I CAN ABOUT LPS I. THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION THAT IS PENDING YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE OR MENTALHEALTH CARE VERSUS. SELF DETERMINATION. IT'S INSTEAD REALLY EVALUATING THE SYSTEMS OF CARE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE WHO ARE IN CRISIS ARE LOCKED UP. OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCESS THE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL CARE THAT THEY- SHOULD BE GIVEN. AND SO I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE CAPACITY QUESTION AS I. DO THINK IT'S THE IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR US TO ADDRESS. AS A STATE AND LOOKING TOWARDS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. WHETHER OR NOT THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR FOR STATE HOSPITALS FOR GRANT FUNDING FOR. BEDS OUT IN COMMUNITY OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S- US LOOKING TOWARD SUPPORT OF HOUSING VERSES PROJECT HOME KEEP. FOR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE AS THE STATE INTO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE LPS BY ITSELF. CANNOT CONNECT PEOPLE TO ONGOING CARE. IF THAT CARE DOES NOT EXIST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO MY QUESTION REALLY IS ABOUT SCOPE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THESE INVESTMENTS WILL MEAN FOR US AS A STATE AND- WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HEAD ON OR IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS UPCOMING YEAR. AND WAS HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION COULD COMMENT REGARDING. BOTH THE STATE HOSPITALS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. WHETHER OR NOT THOSE FUNDING STREAMS WERE APPROPRIATE SUFFICIENT TO WORK. ANY PLANS. I CAN TAKE THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION. AND I CAN STATE THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION MADE A- SPOT THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS IN. HEBER HEALTH CONTINUED TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUED INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY CARE INSURANCE- AND SO. ARE THE PAYER HEALTH CONTINUE- WE RECEIVED TWO POINT TWO BILLION AND THEN. BURKE MEDICARE EXPANSION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AND- DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO A LOT. ABOUT FUNDING WE'RE ACTUALLY REALLY SAYING. I REQUEST REPLICATION IN JANUARY. FOR ON THE FIRST LARGE PORTION OF THAT- AND SO RECOGNIZING THAT. AS MISS LEWIS STATED WE DO NEED- FURTHER CAPACITY I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS SPOT. ON FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WE ARE PUTTING THOSE FUNDS TO GOOD USE AND IT REALLY DOES NOT RAPIDLY- I CANNOT SPEAK TO THAT. I'M STATE HOSPITALS BUT I DO JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE- AND WHILE WE'VE ALREADY HAD STRAINS. TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- JUST WITH THE INCREASING COMPLETED SUICIDES. ON THE RISING OVERDOSE RATES AND ALSO JUST WITH INCREASED. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE'RE SEEING MORE STRAINS ON NOT JUST CAPACITY BUT WORKFORCE. IN RECOGNIZING THAT THERE'S- A NATIONWIDE WORKFORCE ISSUE. BUT WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACTS OF THOUGHT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THAT AND WE'RE HEARING A LOT FROM OUR LOCALS- OUR PROVIDERS ARE COUNTIES ON THAT THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING- WITH. WORKFORCE AND IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT WORKERS- WE WILL- THIS WILL BE A QUESTION A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR BUT WITHIN THE HAND OUT. RAND CORP HAS IDENTIFIED AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND US. THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY FOR US TO TREAT OUR LPS POPULATION IS WITHIN JAILS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND FOR US TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE COMMUNITY SUPPORT. I POINT. US BACK TO THE AUDITORS FINDINGS WHICH SHOW THAT- ONLY NINE PER. OF THOSE WHO NEEDED ON SO. FOR A TO BE. TO THOSE SIR. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY WILL THIS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INVESTMENTS ALLOW US TO START TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITHIN THAT SPECIFIC METRIC. AS I THINK THOSE WHO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING- RESOURCES SHOULD THEN BE CONNECTED TO THOSE RESOURCES FOR US TO START MAKING A DIFFERENCE WITH THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A COUPLE OF BRIEF QUESTIONS AND THEN A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL- MISS IT OR OF. YOU GUYS- YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF DATA COLLECTION- WE ALSO KNOW THAT COUNTIES ARE NOT DOING THAT ANYWAY FOR NOT PROVIDING DATA TO YOU- WHAT ARE YOU USING THE DATA FOR. BECAUSE SOME OF IT ISN'T PUBLISHED- BEYOND WAS PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE WHAT DO YOU USING THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED FOR- IS IT ARE YOU JUST COLLECTING THE BECAUSE YOU'RE MANDATED COLLECTED OR IS THERE A VALUE TO IT. THAT ISN'T APPARENT TO US OR ME ANYWAY- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SEEN IT. WE DO AND THE DATA COLLECTION THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED IN PUMP AND WITH THE POSTED SO THAT IS ONE ASPECT OF IT THE OTHER ONE IS THAT WE DO COLLECT INFORMATION TO ALSO REVIEW IF THERE IS ANY NEED FOR US TO OPEN UP ANY TYPE OF INVESTIGATIONS- BASED OFF OF ANY DATA RECEIVED THAT THERE MIGHT BE ANY PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AS WELL. SO THAT'S INTERNALLY LOOK THAT AGAIN THE INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED- IS FOR THAT PURPOSE I'M IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED BY WE CAN PROVIDE. INFORMATION OR THAT DATA PUBLICLY IF IT'S REQUESTED BUT IT HAS TO JUST MAKE SURE WE ARE MEETING ALL THAT CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY. LAWS UT YOU DON'T BUT COUNTIES ARE NOT SUBMITTING THE DATA SO YOU DON'T KNOW THERE MAY BE PROBLEMS AND SOME OF THESE COUNTIES YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE ARE NOT SUBMITTING DATA AND THEY'RE NOT BEING IN ANY WAY FOR NOT SUBMITTING THE DATA. TWO DATA SETS INCOMPLETE. REYES SO WE ARE FINDING THAT THERE ARE SOME DEFICIENCIES ARE THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THAT SO WE CAN HAVE. BETTER DATA COLLECTION AND A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON. SO THAT IS PART OF WHAT WE REALLY ARE ARE LOOKING AT DOING KIND OF GOING FORWARD AND- IMPROVING OUR DATA COLLECTION TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR- OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE COUNTIES TO. REALLY HAVE A BETTER DOT AND- OKAY- MR- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- IT SOUNDS LIKE FUNDING FOR ELSE L. P. S. IS A MESS IT'S COMING FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE PEOPLE CAN DRAW DOWN FOR LPS ACTIVITIES FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PLACES- FROM THE L. A. O. PERSPECTIVE- SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOMEONE SOME ENTITY THAT OVERSEES ALL OF THE L. P. S. FUNDING ACTIVITIES- TO AN END SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW COORDINATE- YOU KNOW FOR THE DOLLARS IN THE PROGRAM SO THAT SO THAT THE IT WENT WHEN SHE COULD COORDINATE THEN YOU POTENTIALLY HAVE. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS BUT IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPOSED MONEY AWAY AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OR IT MIGHT IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COFFEE THIS MORNING. AT THANK THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD- WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T DONE SORT OF A- A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LPS ACT YOU KNOW- AND SO WE DON'T SORT OF HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FINDING TO SORT OF PROVIDE ON SORT OF WHAT CHANGES TO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE- WOULD BE- WARRANTED OR IF THEY THEY ARE SORT OF NECESSARY AND- IN. INTO TO IMPLEMENT- WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT- PART OF THE REASON WHY A SORT OF THERE ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT DRAWDOWN DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES FOR TO SORT OF SUPPORT THE ACTORS BECAUSE- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT. YOU KNOW ARE. REQUIRED TO SORT OF IMPLEMENT THE ACT AND SO- THE COURT SORT OF HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE COUNTY EVER HEALTH HAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND SO IT ALL SORT OF GETS- MODELED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT SORT OF ACTIVITIES AT DIFFERENT ENTITIES HAVE. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR- WHAT  WILL SAY IS THAT- CONSISTENT WITH SORT OF LIKE- OTHER OVERARCHING COMMENTS THAT WE MADE ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. IT DOES SORT OF MAKE SENSE TO HAVE SORT OF AN OVERARCHING FRAMEWORK TO SORT OF LOOK AT. BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES BROADLY INCLUDING YOU KNOW ISSUES RELATED TO THE LPS ACT. SORT OF- HAVING A SORT OF- UNIFIED FRAMEWORK THROUGH WHICH YOU CAN SORT OF LOOK AT AN ISSUE OR EVALUATE SORT OF A PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW- OUR OFFICE HAS SORT OF COMMENTED ON THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES IN THE PAST AND- WE HAVE SORT OF FOUND THAT THERE THERE IS SOME BENEFIT TO SORT OF HAVING. A MORE UNIFIED AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AT LOOKING AT AN ISSUE. WHAT WHAT ABOUT THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT I GUESS. I GUESS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH- AND THIS WILL BE A THEME THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS. THIS EARLY BUT- BUT IT- I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS WHO HAS ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE L. P. S. ACT- WE'VE GOT PEOPLE TO DRAW FUNDING FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE- IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S KIDS. THAT THINGS ARE COORDINATED AND NOW WE'VE AND WE'RE INVESTING MORE AND MORE MONEY. IN A SYSTEM THAT AS ISN'T. DOESN'T FEEL TERRIBLY COORDINATED. EXPECTING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT OUTCOMES I GUESS I THINK. AND THERE'S SOME GREAT PROGRAMS PLEASE I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT TO. IN ANY WAY TO DISPARAGE OR DOING ANY OF THE GREAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE. BUT I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS WE KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING UP THERE. AND THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S- PROP THE PROBLEM SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR- FOR YOU. MISS IT ORAL IS. WHO IS RESPONSIBILITY WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- FOR THE L. P. S. ACT OR IS THERE ANYBODY. GREAT SITE I THINK THERE IS A COORDINATION THAT IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THERE IS RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN BOTH A DH YES WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND THE COUNTIES. SO PART OF IT IS INCREASING THE COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR TWO- ENTITIES- FOR REALLY. TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND BETTER OVERSIGHT. SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT. THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL TIMIDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE LPS ACT. YES WE ARE AND THEN DESIGNATING AND GIVING THE APPROVAL SO THEY COUNTIES ALSO GO IN AND REVIEW AND- PROVIDE THEIR APPROVALS ARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEBT FACILITIES TO BE DESIGNATED AS AN LPS FACILITY AND DHS ULTIMATELY HAS A RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY TO APPROVE THAT- SO WHO'S WHO IS STRATEGIZING AND PLANNING AND COORDINATING THESE THANK. YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITY BUT WHO WITHIN DH C. S. IS ACTUALLY COORDINATING AND MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING AS IS APPROPRIATE A WE HAVE AN ACT THAT HAS NO DEDICATED FUNDING. SO WE GOT SOME IS PERPETUALLY FUELED- A SHIP THAT'S GIVEN FUEL IT'S FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE- NOW NOW YOU SAID THAT YOU KNOW T. ACS IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR- THE ACT. BUT HOW ARE WE GET WE HAVE INCOMPLETE DATA AND PARTS OF THIS SO HOW DO WE KNOW THIS SHIP IS EVEN GOING ANYWHERE OTHER THAN AND CIRCLE- SKIN REFUEL CONSTANTLY BUT HOW DO WE KNOW. AND WE KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE GOING IT DOESN'T. IT IT JUST FEELS REALLY REALLY UNCOORDINATED. RIGHT SO I MEAN I THINK I AGREE THAT PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INCREASE OUR DATA WE DO WORK INTERNALLY WITH OUR OTHER DIVISIONS AS WELL I'M TO REALLY KIND OF UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS BUT I. WILL OVERLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REALLY IMPROVE OUR DATA COLLECTION SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A BETTER PICTURE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS OP YES PROGRAM SO I GUESS IF YOU COLLECT BETTER DATA- WHO. IS GOING TO USE THAT DATA THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING AT I DON'T YOU'RE GING TO COLLECT DATA WITH MORE INFORMATION WE'VE GOT WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION HERE TODAY. ULTIMATELY WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING CHANGES. IS THERE AN ENTITY OR IS IT JUST IS IT. THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS AN UMBRELLA. I'M JUST STRUGGLING TO. COULD THERE BE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE. I MEAN THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M ASKING. SOMEBODY. I JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND STATE WITH WHAT CHANNELS TALKING ABOUT- WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE AROUND THAT DATA PIECE OF THE FACILITY TYPES SO THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS LIKE YOU MENTIONED- THERE'S THE FACILITY WHERE THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES A CURRENT OF DIFFERENT FACILITIES- THERE'S ALSO LIKE YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ISN'T AN OUTCAST FUNDING SOURCE AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE THERE'S SOME OF THIS FRAGMENTATION I'M THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- YOU CAN USE AN HSA DOLLARS BUT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS AND WHICH I MAY JUST SAY DOLLARS CAN'T BE USED FOR MEDIC HOW CAN COVER SOME OF IT. BUT NOT ALL OF IT AND THEN YOU ALSO LIKE YOU MENTIONED ON YOUR HAVE THE ARM IF THE COURT FOUND THAT IS WORKING YOU KNOW I'M PART OF LPS AS WELL- SO I WOULD JUST STATE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENT PIECES AND THEN OF COURSE THE COUNTY'S TOP. RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL. I WOULD JUST GUESS OF JUST AND I ASKED AT THIS- OF JUST I GUESS MY PER. IS THAT. THAT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY BE DRAWN DOWN FOR. DIFFERENT LPS ACTIVITIES. YOU'RE COLLECTING DATA FROM COUNTIES AND THEN YOU KNOW I'VE GOT COUNTY DON'T HAVE BEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF THIS RIGHT YOU GOT COUNTIES ARE REPORTING TO YOU AT ALL. SO WE GOT ALL THIS MONEY BEING SPENT. AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A COORDINATED. WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACT IS SERVICES I MEAN WE WOULDN'T BE HERE AT THIS HEARING TODAY IF THIS THING WAS RUNNING LIKE A CLOCK. WE WOULDN'T. IT'S CLEARLY CLEARLY SOME SOME SERIOUS SERIOUS CHALLENGES. AND SO I'M WHAT I'M BEGGING FOR AT SOME POINT IS THAT CAN THERE BE SOME WITHIN YOUR AGENCY. TO COORDINATE GATHER THIS DATA AND REALLY ASSESS WHERE THE HECK ARE WE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING. CONSIDERING THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING IN TO THESE PROGRAMS THE WORST THING WE CAN DO IS CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY INTO A SYSTEM. THAT ISN'T BEING EFFECTIVE. WITHOUT TRYING TO CHANGE CHANGE AND IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S KIND OF WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. IS THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS CONSTANTLY THIS ISN'T WORKING. AND AND YET I HEAR WILL COME TO COLLECT MORE DATA. BUT I DON'T HEAR WHERE WHO'S GONNA WHO'S GONNA EVALUATE THE DATA WORDS THE OUTCOMES CAN BE WORSE ACCOUNTABILITY GOING TO BE AND HOW WE GONNA BE AND JUST HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S ABOUT SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THESE SERVICES. AND THAT'S WHAT WAS NOT HAPPENING. IN MY OPINION. OKAY I WOULD AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO STATE THAT- THAT'S WE'VE YOU KNOW TALKED ABOUT TODAY DH CS IS COMMITTED TO MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE AUTHORITY OVER. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY. ON FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF LPS LIKE YOU ALREADY MENTIONED THERE ARE. THERE ARE GAPS AND THERE ARE AREAS. I'M THAT DH YES DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OVERSEE AS WELL MORE. OR WE SHOULD MAYBE LIKE OVER THE COURT SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OVER THOSE. YOU KNOW THOSE COMPONENTS- BUT THAT WE ARE ALSO. YOU KNOW REALLY LOOKING TO SEE- AND ARE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT THEY CAN GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. I HAVE TO SAY. THE NEW. OF MEMBERS HERE. IN DECEMBER FOR AN INTERIM HEARING- ON THIS SUBJECT. SHOULD BE A CLUE THAT THAT THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO US AND WE STAND READY. AS A LEGISLATURE TO WORK. TO COORDINATE TO TRY TO MAKE SOME POSITIVE IMPACT HERE. BUT WE GOT TO WORK AS A TEAM. SO IF YOU GOT IDEAS AS AND AS AS AN AGENCY. WE'RE OPEN TO HEARING THOSE. WE ABSOLUTELY ARE. SOMETHING WENT THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE PANEL AND PART I TEND TO GET OVERWHELMED UP SOMETIMES I GUESS I GOT A MAYBE I HAD MORE COFFEE THAN I THOUGHT- BUT ANYWAY I'M GONNA MOVE ON WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MOVE ON ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL OUR PANELISTS AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT AND- JUST UNDERSTAND THAT I DO THIS AND- NOT YEAH I'M TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO- MOVE THE BALL HERE AND- AND- HOPE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR EVERYONE SO. WITHOUT GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY CO CHAIR- MR STONE WHO ENTERS OUR NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER WHAT'S THE- PANEL. IS A PANEL OF MEMBERS CHOLESKY. TO BOZO AND CARIS MERRICK BOTH OF. WHOM ARE WITH US REMOTELY. SO THANK YOU BOTH THE BUZZER. ARE YOU WITH US WONDERFUL THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVES OF WHAT IN STONE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AT LEAST. IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT. WITHIN THE LAST YEAR MAYBE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY. ARE YOUR FEET IS VERY SLOW YOU MAY NEED TO TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO. CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT OKAY. RIGHT IMAGINE YOUR LIFE TRAJECTORY BEING JUDGED YOUR LOWEST POINT MAYBE IT IS A DAY WEEKS MONTHS OR LONGER. FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DAY I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF FOLLOWING A SEXUAL ASSAULT. WHEN I WAS INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED I WAS TREATED LIKE A BURDEN AND I WAS TOLD. NOT TO LET MYSELF GET RAPED AGAIN. AS A BLACK WOMAN I ALWAYS HAVE TO CONSIDER THE ROLE THE HISTORICAL RACISM PLAYS AND MY TREATMENT AND CARE. AT THE HOSPITAL I EXPERIENCED CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS AND VERBAL ABUSE AND THE TREATMENT MODALITY. IT WAS COLORING AND WATCHING SILENCE OF THE LAMBS THERE IS NO THERAPY NO% DIGNITY AND CERTAINLY NO CURE SUPPORT. WE WERE TOLD WHEN TO WAKE UP WHAT TO EAT WHAT MEDICATION TO TAKE. THERE IS NO CHOICE. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAD A MENTAL ILLNESS I WOULD NEVER WORK IN A RELATIONSHIP OR HAVE A FILLING LIFE. AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT MY MOTHER ENVISIONED FOR ME WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO GET ME HELP. MY STORY IS NOT RARE IT IS NOT UNIQUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKE LL OF YOUR DECISIONS FOR YOU TAKE AWAY YOUR AGENCY AND LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU WERE BROKEN CHILD. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SENT AWAY. THE SPACE TO HEAL WASN'T HEALING IT WAS OVERCROWDED AND CHAOTIC AND THEN I WAS RELEASED NO FOLLOW UP NO AFTER CARE NO SUPPORT OF LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. SO THE CURRENT TREATMENT IS TRAUMATIC WHY WOULD WE EXPAND WHAT TRAUMA RECEIVED FROM INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT TAKES TIME TO RECOVER FROM AND I TRULY BELIEVE OUR COLLECTIVE INTENTION IS NOT TO SUBJECT PEOPLE TO TRAUMA BY OVER TAX SYSTEMS. PEOPLE DESERVE AND NEED VOLUNTARY OPTIONS WAS ACTUALLY HELPFUL PURE SUPPORT. VOLUNTARY TRAUMA INFORMED THERAPY AND A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY THAT BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE CAN AND DO RECOVER. EVERYONE DESERVES ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF ROBUST EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES AND CULTURE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT STAY CONNECTED WITH THEM AND JUST FOLLOW UP. IN THE STATE BECAUSE THOSE LONG PSYCHE. HOSPITALS WE WERE. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT IS A PROMISE THAT HAS NOT BEEN BUILT. WE CANNOT LOOK AT LPS CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE LARGER MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. EXERCISING THAT MUCH CONTROL OVER SOMEONE'S EMOTIONAL AND BODILY AUTONOMY IS REALLY JUST A WAY NOT TO LOOK AT. CONTEXT IN A SIDE STEP SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THAT CREATE SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION AND TRAUMA. I THINK WE TEND TO WANT TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER PEOPLE LABELED THEM AS THE PROBLEMS WHEN WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T CONTROL BIGGER SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. LIKE HOMELESSNESS. WE SHOULD BE MOVING INTO THE DIRECTION OF ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE HUMAN RIGHTS SPACE AND CENTERS THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND EXPANDING CONSERVATORSHIP IS CERTAINLY A MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I SUPPORT VOLUNTARY CHOICES AND THE DIGNITY OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT SERVICES MEDICATIONS AND SUPPORTS. NOT ONLY IS CORPORATION A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE IT'S ULTIMATELY INEFFECTIVE. TRYING TO HELP SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BY TAKING AWAY THEIR RIGHTS. EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT FORCE TREATMENT CONTRIBUTES TO. QUOTE UNQUOTE ON NON COMPLIANCE. IT UNDERMINES THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND THERAPIST IT MAGNIFIES POWER DIFFERENTIALS AND DIMINISHES THE SENSE OF PERSONAL DIGNITY. AND. SELF ADVOCACY THAT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOVER. INTO TWENTY WE ALREADY RECEIVED A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PAGE LPS AUDIT THAT FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY MAKING ANY CHANGES TO OUTKAST CRITERIA. MUCH LESS EXPANDING IT. THE REPORT UNDERSCORED SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH HOW CALIFORNIANS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES WERE CARED FOR INCLUDING HAVING LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS EXPLAINED THAT MANY PEOPLE ON INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. I'M NOT BEEN CONSISTENTLY ENROLLED IN CARE TO HELP THEM SAFELY RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. ALREADY TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE PUT AWAY AND AN INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IS THE PRECURSOR TO CONSERVATORSHIP. INSTEAD CAN WE MOVE PEER CERTIFICATION FROM AN OPTIONALCOUNTY PROCESS TO A ROBUST WIDE MEDI CAL BENEFITS I DIDN'T NEW FUNDING TO EXPAND CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS. LIKE THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITY PROJECTS CAN WE INVEST MORE SERVICES IT IS STOCK TO OFFER DROP IN MEDICAL SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHOUT COERCION. CAN WE START TO UNTANGLE THE MASSIVE RED TAPE THAT BLOCKS THE COUNTY'S ABILITY TO PROCURE BUILDINGS AND BUILD YOUR RESPITE RATHER THAN EXPANDING HOSPITAL BEDS. WE CAN'T SAY VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS DON'T WORK IF WE'VE NEVER FULLY FUNDED THEM OR IMPLEMENTED THEM AND IF IT TOOK A MEGA SUPERSTAR WITH HUGE FAN BASE EXPENSIVE LAWYERS I SPENDING HASHTAG A PASSION FREE BRITNEY. THIRTEEN YEARS TO BE RELEASED FROM HER CONSERVATORSHIP WHAT IS THE TRAJECTORY FOR BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR WHITE FOLKS WITH NO RESOURCES. WHAT O YOU COMMUNICATING ABOUT PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO. RECOVER IF YOU SWEEP THEM AWAY AND CONTROL THEM WE WANT OUR LOVED ONES AND OUR COMMUNITY SO HE'LL RIGHT SO WHY WOULD WE MEDICALLY INCARCERATE THEM AND THINK IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST IT'S NOT. EXPANDING LKS LAW IS A VIOLATION OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND HISTORICALLY WITH MOST LAWS THAT ARE INEQUITABLE ARE BY POCK TRANS QUEER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING OF THIS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHOSE HARD THIS TIME DOES NOT AND DID NOT TO FIND. URGE YOU NOT TO EXPAND THIS LAW AND TO SPEND TIME FUNDING HARM REDUCTION YOUR SUPPORT. INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. THANK SO MUCH I'M SORRY I COULDN'T BE ON CAMERA. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO TESTIFY AND NOW WITH THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THAT CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. SO OUR NEXT IS CHARISMATIC. MICHAEL THERE WILL YES WE CAN. OKAY HI I'M CHARISMATIC AND ON WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION APPEAR SUPPORTERS A PERSON WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARMY OR HANDOUT CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE GLOBAL.

I WAS AN INCONVENIENCE NOT WORTH THE BOTHER TO ENGAGE- AND ADDS A RESPONSE I WAS DECLINING EVERY REQUEST INCLUDING HAVING MY TEMPERATURE TAKEN. AT WHICH TIME I HEARD THE WORD CODE.

THE FOURTEENTH SUBSEQUENT INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATIONS THAT WOULD FOLLOW IN CALIFORNIA. I COULDN'T BEAR TO WEAR THEM I COULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ALL YOUR REMINDER THAT I WAS SO BROKEN AND SO BLACK IN AMERICA. THAT SOMEHOW THE TREATMENT I RECEIVED MUST'VE BEEN DESERVED EVEN ON ONE IS SAID TO HAVE ON THE SIGNALS YEAH. THERE'S A LOOK WHAT CODE IS. THAT FORCE NO MATTER HOW BUSY BEGETS RESISTANCE. PERHAPS IT IS OUR SYSTEMS NOT JUST ONE BUT MANY SYSTEMS THAT HAS AND HAS IGNORED THE ARE A LACK OF INSIGHT ABOUT OUR NEEDS AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO THE MOST VULNERABLE OF CALIFORNIANS WHOSE MENTAL HEALTH IS SERIOUSLY IMPACTED IN THE COLLECTED. WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL PEOPLE WE CAN HELP THE PEOPLE TO BROKEN SYSTEMS RATHER WE SHOULD BE COMPELLING SUPPORTING SYSTEMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. FORCE NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL EVEN IN POLICY READ REGULATIONS. WELL THAT WAS INSTALLED. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. NUMBER IT MAY NOT BE OUT. EXPANSION BUT RATHER IT MAY BE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO CREATE A VOLUNTARY ACCESS IS ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT MEET OUR NEEDS WHEN WHERE AND HOW WE NEED THEM. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT ARE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY DRIVEN CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY ALIGNED PERSON CENTERED AND ACTIVE. ANY CONSIDERATION OF IMPROVING LCS HELP YES THAT INCLUDES INCREASING THE PREPARATION OF THE RIGHTS. ARE NEEDS TO BE DATA DRIVEN. CURRENTLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO LPS DESIGNATED FOLKS WE DON'T HAVE THE BATTLE. AT THE BOTTOM INDIGENOUS PERSON I'M APPALLED WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS- SORRY BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND THAT THE LITTLE THAT WE DO HAVE. CLEARLY AND KEEP INDICATES.

DAY FOR ME ARE THE WEAPON OF POWER PRIDE AND PERSISTENCE I WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HEART IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE RIGHT PROBLEM WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK DEPENDING HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EITHER OF THESE WITH THE- DRESS I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR PROVIDING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IT'S VERY HELPFUL WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT POLICY TRIED TO DO OVERSIGHT WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS POLICY MAKERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED OUR SYSTEM AND CAN GIVE US INSIGHT TO THAT OTHERS COULD NOT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR PROVIDING THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS SIGNAL AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU IT IS. WE REALIZE THAT IT IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO BE. TESTIFYING IN BODIES LIKE THIS WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO BE WITH US AND PRESENT YOUR PERSONAL STORIES. THOUGH THANK YOU BOTH VERY VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE WILL THEN MOVE ON TO OUR FOURTH PANEL. WHICH IS A REVIEW OF THE L. P. S. AUDIT BY OUR STATE AUDITOR AND WE HAVE TO MEMBERS BOTH WITH US IN PERSON ELAINE HOWELL WHO IS OUR STATE AUDITOR. AND BOB HARRIS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING WELCOME PLEASE GOOD MORNING. GERMAN WORD CHAIRMAN STONE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES- SENATOR EGGMAN- FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL I AM CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR- WITH ME IS BOB HARRIS HE WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT I'M GOING TO AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. COVER SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN AN AUDIT WE ISSUED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PRIMARILY RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION I WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE THREE COUNTIES THAT WE VISITED WE VISITED LOS ANGELES. SHASTA COUNTY AND SAN FRANCISCO AND LOOKED AT SOME OF THEIR- PROCESSES BUT BUT REALLY WANT TO TALK TODAY ABOUT HIGH LEVEL KEY ISSUES AND SOME LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE THAT- SOME OF WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN UP AND AS YOU HEARD FROM A PREVIOUS A PANELIST- LEGISLATION WAS CHAPTER THAT THAT REALLY HAS IMPROVED- THE PROGRAM FOR A GREAT STEP IN. THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO LET ME FIRST START WITH THE FIRST KEY ISSUE MEMBERS WHEN THE REQUESTERS **** TO CONDUCT THIS AUDIT ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS IS THE CRITERIA WITHIN THE LANHAM AND PETROUS ACT BEING USED INCONSISTENTLY ARE PEOPLE BEING TREATED AND CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE STATE. SO THE FIRST ISSUE WE REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT WAS THE ASSESSMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONDITION IN THE DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON NEEDED TO BE PLACED ON AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. SO WE LOOKED AT- SHORT TERM HOLDS DECISIONS MADE RELATED TO SHORT TERM HOLD ON SOME CONSERVATORSHIP DECISIONS MADE- WITH RESPECT TO THOSE. AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT CASES WHERE THE DETERMINATION WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT NEED TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD WE WANT TO LOOK AT ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS. AND AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. PREVIOUSLY BY SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CRITERIA WE DIDN'T SEE SIGNIFICANT KINDS INCONSISTENCIES. IN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING THESE DETERMINATIONS AT EACH OF THE COUNTIES SOME HAD- SHASTA COUNTY PARTICULAR HAD MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR THEIR INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE MAKING THESE DECISIONS BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY SO WE DID REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT. WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE ANY REVISIONS TO THE CRITERIA. IN THE LETTERMAN PETROUS ACT WITH RESPECT INVOLUNTARY HOLDS SO WE REACH THAT CONCLUSION WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. SO MOVING ON TO IF YOU MAKE A DETERMINATION SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE PLACED IN AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. LOOKING AT CAPACITY BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL THE THREE COUNTIES I MENTIONED. AS TO THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR STATE HOSPITALS. TO PROVIDE BED SPACE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED INTENSIVE INPATIENT TREATMENT. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IN LOOKING AT STATE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THOSE STATE HOSPITALS ARE REALLY HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION. TO PROVIDE BEDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED AND COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. MAJORITY OF THE BED SPACE IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS. IS TAKEN UP BY THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. WE'RE LOOKING AT FISCAL YEAR STATE HOSPITAL WERE WERE. OCCUPIED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THAT MEANS IS INDIVIDUALS- DETERMINED THAT NEED THAT ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE OF LETTERMAN ACT. ARE WAITING FOR A LONG TIME TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE BEDS. ON AVERAGE WE DETERMINED THERE WAITING AT LEAST A YEAR ON AVERAGE TO GET A BET. ON IN SOME CASES IT WAS LONGER THAN THAT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES WE LOOKED AT. SO ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHAT ARE THEY FACED WITH WEALTH WHICH WE TRY TO PROVIDE AS A STATE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DO WE HAVE BED SPACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THEN LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES AGAIN SAN FRANCISCO IN SHASTA WE ASK THEM WHAT KIND OF CAPACITY DO YOU HAVE. AND CONSISTENTLY THEY'RE SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHEN WE ASKED EACH OF THE THREE COUNTIES. DO YOU DO AN ANALYSIS OF. HOW MUCH YOU KNOW THE NEED FOR BED SPACE. LOS ANGELES HAD A VERY ROBUST PROCESS WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD DONE AN ANALYSIS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. INDICATING THAT THEY NEEDED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BEDS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES INPATIENT SERVICES. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP. ON SEPARATIST GO HAD NOT DONE THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS SHASTA WAS VERY SMALL SO ON A MONTHLY BASIS THEY WOULD COMMUNICATE- WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW HOW IF THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS WAITING FOR A BED- BUT A SMALL COUNTY WE REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT A SMALL COUNTY BUT LOS ANGELES HAD A VERY ROBUST PROCESS SO THAT COULD BE CERTAINLY BE USED AS A MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTIES. TO DETERMINE HOW MANY. BEDS ARE REALLY NEEDED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD IS TO REQUIRE STATE HOSPITALS TO REPORT. AND WAS BY APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SHOULD JUST REPORT IN JULY AND AS YOU KNOW MEMBERS. IN OUR REPORTS NOW WE SPECIFIED TIME FRAME- TO. AGENCIES TO YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY THIS DATE AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME WE SAID APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO IDENTIFY. HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO EITHER IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL. FACILITIES THAT COULD BE USED AS STATE HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE EDS FOR. YOU KNOW THE INCOMPETENT TO STANDTRIAL BUT CERTAINLY THE LPS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEEDING THAT INTENSIVE AN INPATIENT TREATMENT. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE. WE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE COUNTIES. DEVELOP WAYS TO- DECIDE OR DETERMINE HOW MANY BEDS THEY ACTUALLY NEED NOT ONLY CURRENTLY BUT IN THE FUTURE TRY TO ASSESS TRY TO PROJECT YOUR NEEDS AND AGAIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I HAVE TO SAY. AND BREEDING REPORT AGAIN THIS WEEKEND REALLY DID HAVE A READ ROBUST PROCESS TO DO THAT ANALYSIS. SO WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO NOW IF SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A- BED AT THE STATE LEVEL DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A BED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR INTENSIVE CARE. WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED WHEN WE WERE CONDUCTING THE WORK IS. PEOPLE AS YOU I'M SURE HAVE HEARD OUR CYCLING THEIR CYCLING IN CRISIS THEY'RE IN A IN A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD THEIR RELEASED. THERE'S NO BED SPACE AVAILABLE FOR THEM PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE THEM IN AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE. BUT WHAT WE WERE SEEING IS A LOT OF. INDIVIDUALS CONSISTENTLY CYCLING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED EITHER AN INPATIENT. A SITUATION OR SCENARIO. OR THROUGH ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. SOMEONE TALKING TO THE COUNTIES WHAT WHY AREN'T YOU ABLE TO NOT JUST THE BED SPACE BUT WHY AREN'T YOU ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF GAPS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED MANY OF THE COUNTIES INDICATED TO US. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CYCLING THROUGH EITHER SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. OR PERHAPS A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE DID AN ANALYSIS WE HAD ACCESS TO DATA. THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO WHICH IS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF SAYS YOU KNOW OF ARMED PROHIBITED PERSONS IN FACT MR HARRIS WAS THE MANAGER ON THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT. WHERE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO JUSTICE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PLACED ON A- FIFTY ONE FIFTY. THIS PERSON SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO. HAVING A WEAPON BECAUSE THEY ARE DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. SO WHEN USING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DATA. WE IDENTIFIED FOR SOME OF THESE COUNTIES YOU HAVE. SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE PLACED ON AT LEAST. FIVE OR MORE HOLD OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR WINDOW THIS IS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SO WE SAID HOW MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THEY COULDN'T GET A BED. HOW MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY GOT ACCESS TO. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT A REALLY GOOD TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT WAS TWO TWO OUT OF TWENTY SOURCE ABOUT TEN PERCENT. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE GETTING THAT KIND OF CARE SO AGAIN THOSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GETTING THAT KIND OF CARE. AGAIN ARE GOING FROM. CRISIS MODE TO CRISIS MODE TO PRICES MOTHER NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. WE LOOK TO SAN FRANCISCO IT WAS EVEN WORSE IT WAS ONE OUT OF TWENTY INDIVIDUALS. SO WHAT WE DETERMINED IS A THIS IS INFORMATION THAT THE COUNTY NEEDS THE COUNTY NEEDS THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION SO WE DID MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS. ALREADY STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO JUSTICE SO GET THAT INFORMATION TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO HEALTHCARE SERVICES CAN LOOK AT. THAT INFORMATION AND SHARE IT WITH THE COUNTIES AND SAY THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE PLACED ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY WERE REPORTED TO US THEY CANNOT. HAVE A WEAPON BECAUSE THEY ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS BUT WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO THESE FOLKS TO TRY TO GET THEM THE CARE AND TREATMENT THEY NEED- SO WE SO WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION. THAT JUSTICE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION HEALTHCARE SERVICES. HEALTHCARE SERVICES USE THAT INFORMATION AND WORK WITH THE LOCALS. THE COUNTIES- DEPARTMENT SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND YOU THE RESIDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THIS KIND OF CARE SO THAT THEY HOPEFULLY CAN. WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GET THEM TO THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. OR TO THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS GET THEM THE CARE THEY NEED SO THEY STOP CYCLING. SO SOME KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THERE SO THEN WE SAID OKAY WELL LET'S LOOK AT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT HOW EFFECTIVE IS THAT WHAT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THAT. WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT WHAT WE DETERMINED IS AS YOU KNOW THAT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS A VOLUNTARY COUNTIES CAN VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN THAT AT THE TIME WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT AND AT THAT TIME YOU'RE ONLY NINETEEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT WERE USING ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THAT REALLY EMBRACED IT. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS- WITHIN THE LETERMAN ACT. THAT LIMITED PEOPLE AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES- IS EGGMAN'S BILL CORRECTED. IS THAT AND WE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS COMING OFF OF CONSERVATORSHIP. THEY'RE DOING BETTER THEY DIDN'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BECAUSE YOU HAD TO HAVE. YOU KNOW YOUR CONDITION HAD TO BE DEGRADING. HER LEGISLATION FIX THAT SO I THINK THAT'S SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IN THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THIS ASSISTANT OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OFF OF CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IS OF SIXTY CONSERVATORSHIP. EIGHTEEN OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP COMING OFF OF CONSERVATORSHIP. COULDN'T GET THAT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AT SYSTEM CONTINUOUS CARE. WENT BACK INTO CRISIS MODE WENT BACK INTO CONSERVATORSHIP. A LONGER CYCLE BUT STILL CYCLING- SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT LEGISLATION CERTAINLY HAS HAS MADE AN IMPROVEMENT. ANOTHER AREA RELATED TO CRITERIA UNDER THE LANHAM AND PEPPERS- SHORT ACT IS THE COURT ORDERED MEDICATION- THIS IS ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE IS TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE EXPRESS A STORY TO INCLUDE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS IN COURT ORDERED. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PLANTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS. IS AUTHORIZED IN OTHER STATES I THINK WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT TWELVE OTHER STATES THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THIS AND IT REALLY DOES HELP BECAUSE IT IT REALLY ENCOURAGES AND IT'S A WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO. THEIR PARTICIPATING IN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IT'S A LEAST LESS RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAN INPATIENT. IT'S GOING TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUAL STAY ON THEIR MEDICATION AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT MANY PEOPLE WHO RIVER RIVER TENANTS BAD WORD BUT CYCLE BACK IT'S BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER TAKE THEIR TO THEIR MEDICATION. OR THEY THEIR ILLNESSES SUCH THAT THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT MEDICATION IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO AVOID ENDING UP ON A- SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ENDING UP IN IN PATIENT- TREATMENT SO. WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT- AS FAR AS THE YOU KNOW NINETEEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY'S AGAIN. MS EGGMAN'S BILL AS FAR AS- OF REQUIRING COUNTIES TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY PUBLICLY OPT OUT OF USING ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. PUT SOME PRESSURE ON SOME COUNTIES QUITE FRANKLY AND NOW INSTEAD OF NINETEEN COUNTIES WE HAVE THIRTY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE USING ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AND THAT'S BASED ON YOU KNOW RESEARCHERS EXPERTS NOT AUDITORS THIS IS A VERY EFFECTIVE TYPE OF TREATMENT NOW IF WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GET THE- THE OTHER. THE RECOMMENDATION WE MADE TO PROVIDE EXPRESSIVE SORTIE TO INCLUDE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS AND COURT ORDERED TO A TREATMENT PLANT THAT'S WHAT I THINK GOING TO MAKE THOSE PROGRAMS EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE SO THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE CONTINUE. TO EMBRACE AND SUGGEST TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THOSE ARE THE KEY ISSUES RELATED TO ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. AND THE LAST THING AND THIS A DOCTOR WHAT I THINK WILL TIE INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU HAD FOR PREVIOUS YOUR SOME OF YOUR FRUSTRATIONS. OR AUDITORS WE WANT TO KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING HERE'S WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT THERE WAS ABOUT CLOSE TO EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BEING INVESTED. AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA EITHER THROUGH REALIGNMENT MONEY. MEDI CAL MONEY M. HSA MONEY BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK IT'S VERY DISJOINTED AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TOOLS DIFFERENT REPORTING MECHANISMS BUT THERE ISN'T AN OVER ARCHING. COMPREHENSIVE CLEAR VIEW OF THE INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA MAKES IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOW CERTAINLY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS TERRIFIC FOR CALIFORNIA THERE ARE CATEGORIES THAT ARE COUNTIES HER MENTAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL REQUIRED TO REPORT UP TO THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION IN CALIFORNIA MY WHOLE SERVICES ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT COMMISSION HAS THOSE CATEGORIES OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION INNOVATION AT CETERA ETCETERAAND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TIME THAT AND AS MR SANTIAGO MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE IDENTIFIED ON SPENT MONEY WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS AUDIT REPORT LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUSTIN. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION COMMUNITY SUPPORT AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HAD CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UNSPENT FUNDS AND THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THE RESERVE THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HOLD ON TO SO THERE IS MONEY AVAILABLE OUT THERE SO WHAT WE DID IS WHEN WE LOOKED AT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK AND WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. WE FELT THAT IT NEEDED TO BE THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY ALREADY HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN HSA MONEY. THOSE CATEGORIES THEY'RE A BIT TOO BROAD FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE INVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO ASSIGN THIS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. REQUIRE THAT COMMISSION TO WORK WITH STATE AND LOCAL. EXPERTS MENTAL HEALTH OFFICIALS- TO REALLY DENTIFY THE MAJOR FUNDING SOURCES- WHAT PROGRAMS THOSE FUNDING SOURCES SUPPORT. WHAT OUTCOMES ARE WE LOOKING FOR WHAT TYPES OF THINGS SHOULD WE BE ASSESSING. AND COLLECTING SO JUST I'M GOING TO VERY QUICKLY GO THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATION SO ASSIGNEE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THAT RESPONSIBILITY. DEVELOP CATEGORIES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. IN PATIENT CARE VERSUS INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT HOW MUCH ARE WE SPENDING ON INPATIENT CARE VERSUS OUTPATIENT THEN IDENTIFYING SOME INDICATORS SOME THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED DUE TO A MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMETHING THEY ARE CRIME THEY COMMITTED DUE. DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS HOW MANY REPEAT HOLDS HAS AN INDIVIDUAL BEEN THROUGH. THE RATES OF SUICIDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING TREATMENT SOME DIFFERENT INDICATORS TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS HOW SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA'S IN PROVIDING SERVICES. TO THE MENTALLY ILL IN OUR STATE. SO THAT WAS ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION TO DIRECTLY OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO DEVELOP THE STATE WIDE MEASURES AGAIN WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS TO REALLY AND EXPERTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN WE MEASURE. AND WORK WHEN WE DETERMINE WHAT WE WANT TO MEASURE THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO COLLECT TO BE ABLE TO US TO USE THAT MEASUREMENT. TO ASSESS HOW SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA IS. AND THEN TWO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO M. M. HSA. AND ONE IS TO AMEND STATE LAW TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LEFT LPS ACT HOLDS TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH AN HSA. SO THOSE AT THAT WOULD REALLY TIE INTO THIS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT YOU CAN USE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES OR COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDS- FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OFF OF THESE HOLD BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE ACT AND I THINK. THE DESIRE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE ILLNESSES AND ON FOR ARE PLACED ON A HOLD FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY. TO GET THEM THE HELP THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO HAVE A VERY ACCEPT SUCCESSFUL COMFORTABLE LIFE IN CALIFORNIA SO. SO THAT WAS ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD AND THEN. FINALLY ESTABLISH A GOAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FOR CONNECTING ALL INDIVIDUALS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS SO WE'VE GOT THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT. LET'S DETERMINE THE INDICATORS HOWARD WHAT OUTCOMES WE WANT TO WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. AND THEN WHAT TYPE OF DAY WE NEED TO COLLECT BUT MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AND THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WANT THESE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR AND TO SUPPORT. SO WITHOUT MEMBERS. I WILL ALLOW ABOUT TO ANSWER ALL YOUR DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU HUNDREDS OF COUPLE QUESTIONS ON. DID YOU GET A SENSE IS IT. YOU WERE TALKING TO THE COUNTIES. HE SAID THAT THERE ARE NINETEEN COUNTIES THAT HEAD OFFICE IS THAT A PATIENT TREATMENT AND THE OTHERS HAD AND NOW THAT IT'S INCREASED. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY DID YOU GET. A SENSE OF THAT. BUT HARRIS FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SIR. BUT THE THREE COUNTIES WE AUDITED HAD ALREADY EITHER IMPLEMENTED A. O. T. OR A PILOT VERSION OF IT. SO WHAT WE DID TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHY SOME COUNTIES MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTING A O. T. AT THE TIME AS WE LOOK AT THREE OTHERS THAT- HAD NOT YET AT LEAST YOU COUNTY WAS ONE OF THEM- AND I'M- NOT REMEMBERING THE OTHER TWO OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR- PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO ADOPT A T. AT THE TIME THE CONCERNS ESSENTIALLY BOIL DOWN TO TWO FACTORS ONE WAS COST. AND THE OTHER WAS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS WOULD BE A DUPLICATION OF SERVICES SO THOSE ARE THE CENTRAL REASONS WE DETERMINED. THERE MIGHT BE RESISTANCE TO ADOPTING ANTI. OKAY AND THEN THEN THAT MAKES SENSE- JUST WONDERING ABOUT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE FRACTURE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE'VE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AT LEAST THOSE OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE AND- GOES BACK DECADES. AS THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN DISMANTLED ESPECIALLY DISMANTLING THE STATE HOSPITALS. THERE WAS NOTHING BUILT BACK UP I THINK THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. A INCREASING CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE EXACTLY THE BEDS AND THINGS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S REALLY NEVER HAPPENED AND SO WE'VE ENDED UP WITH A FRACTURED SYSTEM. AND I THINK WE'LL DISCONNECT BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AND ABILITIES THEY'VE BEEN. WITH THIS BECAUSE AND IT'S INTERESTING YOU LOOKED AT SOME LARGE COUNTIES AND YOU LOOK AT SOME SMALL COUNTIES. I THINK THEY'RE FROM VERY DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS LARGE COUNTIES TO SMALL COUNTIES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE POPULATION THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SO IN IN YOUR SENSE WITH THE COUNTIES YOU DID TALK TO THAT AYE IT ASKED THE AGENCY EARLIER ABOUT ABOUT A BACKLOG THEY SAID THERE IS NO BACKLOG ALTHOUGH IN AS I'M DEALING WITH AND TALKING TO TWO COUNTIES THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE LICENSING PROCESS SO FROM YOUR SENSE IN THE DATA THAT YOU LOOKED AT AND TEN PART OF HIS HEARING HAS REALLY REVEALED. SOME SIGNIFICANT DATA DISCREPANCIES WHICH ARE CHALLENGING AND YOU WERE ABLE TO GO INTO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND GET INFORMATION THAT DACA'S DID NOT HAVE AND WE DO SO MUCH IN THE STATE IN SILOS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING N. IN IN HIS OR THE ABILITY OF THE RIGHT INFORMATION GETTING TO THE RIGHT. DECISION MAKERS AT THE RIGHT TIME IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE THIS AND SOME OF THE REASONS ARE GOOD A LOT OF THE REASONS OR JUST BECAUSE OF HOW WE'VE ALL DONE IT. OR BUREAUCRACIES OR OR WHATEVER. BUT IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE COUNTY THAT LEAST THE SUBSET THAT YOU LOOKED AT ARE THEY GETTING. THE ARE THEY ABLE TO GET THE FACILITIES THEY FEEL THAT THEY NEED LICENSE AND UP TO SPEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. SO WHAT WOULD THERE'S- THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECTED I'M NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND. RIGHT SO WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE LICENSING COMPONENT- IN TERMS OF THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THIRD. HEALTHCARE SERVICE NICE I THINK NUMBERS OF FACILITIES THAT CORRECTIVE REALLY DIFFERENT FACILITIES ONLINE AS NEEDED. RIGHT SO WE DID LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROCESS FOR APPROVING DESIGNATED FACILITIES CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS OF DESIGNATED SO AS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT WE FOUND IN THAT AREA EVERYTHING SEEMED OKAY TO US IN THAT AREA SO. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO A BACKLOG OR PENDING DEMAND FOR FACILITY DESIGNATION THERE ARE CERTAINLY THOUGH THE CONCERNS WE NOTED ABOUT BED CAPACITY GENERALLY- ONE OF THE WAYS YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT IS BY BRINGING MORE FACILITIES ONLINE BUT WE DIDN'T SEE. A LOG JAM OR A PROBLEM WITH GETTING THOSE FACILITIES APPROVED. OKAY SO YES I'M STILL KIND OF SCRATCH MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT WHAT. WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS. IS OUR COUNTIES. NOT ASKING FOR THE RIGHT FACILITIES DO WE NOT HAVE THE RIGHT MIX OF FACILITIES- AND SOME OF IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDING RELATED AND OTHERS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN NECESSARILY ANSWER THAT BUT THAT'S THAT IS A COMPONENT HERE THAT THAT I THINK NEEDS TO REALLY BE THE LOOKED AT AND ADDRESSED AND FROM WHAT YOU FOUND ME ONE OF THE UNDERLYING REASONS THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING IS SOME REQUESTS TO EXPAND. DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED SO FOR EXPANDING. THE DEFINITIONS TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE L. P. S. KIND OF AUTHORITY. JUDGING BY WHAT YOU HAD SEEN WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM FOR DOING. THAT BUT THE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE SYSTEM'S ALREADY. STRAINED TO COMPLETELY UNABLE IN SOME CASES THEY HANDLE THE- DEMAND IF YOU WILL OR THE NEED FOR BEDS- SO. THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS WIDENING THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEED THOSE BEDS ARE NEED THOSE SERVICES WOULD PUT FURTHER STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM. EVERYTHING FROM YOUR RECORD THAT. YOU'RE CLEARLY POINTING OUT SOME OF THE WEAKNESS IS THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD PROBABLY E BETTER SERVED TO BOLSTER AND SUPPORT AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FUNDING FOR KIND OF SETTING BETTER FRAMEWORKS BEFORE WE REALLY EXPANDS. ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THAT RIGHT THERE REALLY BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHERE WITH THOSE FOLKS GO AND HOW ARE THEY ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE SERVED SO. AND THEN AFTER I MET THANK YOU TO OUR SON I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON- THE PERMITTING IF IT'S NOT LICENSING HERE AT THE STATE IS THERE ANYTHING HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT MAY BE PROHIBITING AN APPROVAL PROCESS SUCH AS NIMBYISM REGARDING HAVING- THESE FACILITIES. IN THE COMMUNITY. SO AND FORCE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT WE DIDN'T LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE COUNTY PROCESSES FOR DESIGNATING FACILITIES AND WHETHER THERE IS. OBSTACLES IN THAT AREA. I WILL HIGHLIGHT FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT ON PAGE TWENTY THREE OF THE HAND OUT THERE IS SOME INFORMATION REGARDING. THE CONCERN ABOUT NIMBYISM- AND- THE NEED FOR US TO HELP TO REMOVE SOME OF THE RED TAPE AND SO I HOPE TO FOLLOW UP WITH MANY OF US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN HAVE THESE CONTINUE ONCE BUILT OUT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT. NEED THEM THE MOST. I'M WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ALSO ON THE SEILING OF INFORMATION I THINK IT WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT REGARDING THAT DOJ HAD THE INFORMATION BUT THE IT'S THE US DID NOT. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO. ENCOURAGE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ARE CUNTY PARTNERS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING THE L. P. S. ACT HOLDS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED- ARE THERE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS HE WOULD HAVE FOR US TO FOLLOW UP ON. YEAH THERE ARE SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY WAS THAT THE INFORMATION SHARING IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO OCCUR AND IS OCCURRING BETWEEN THE DESIGNATED FACILITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. UNDER TWO OF THE THREE HOLD CRITERIA THAT'S DANGER TO SELF IMAGE DANGER TO OTHERS. THAT INFORMATION ALREADY FLOWS UP TO THE STATE LEVEL OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES SHARE THAT INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY JUSTICE SHARES WITH HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AND THAT HEALTHCARE SERVICESTHAN IN PART PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY SHARES IT DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL. THAT WOULD GET YOU THAT THE INDIVIDUALS HELD ON THE FIRST TWO CRITERIA. THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A CHANGE TO STATE LAW ALSO TO REQUIRE THE FACILITIES TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES ABOUT. INDIVIDUALS HELD UNDER THE GRAVELY DISABLED CRITERION. WHICH THEY COULD THEN REPORT BACK DOWN TO THE COUNTIES- THERE WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE CHANGES TO STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO WHAT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ALLOWED TO POSSESS BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. WHICH THIS WOULD CERTAINLY INCLUDE BUT IT WOULD IT IT WOULD BE IN SERVICE OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES TO AS YOU. INDICATED ALLOW THOSE COUNTIES TO CONTACT THOSE INDIVIDUALS KNOW THAT THEY WERE EVEN HELD RIGHT NOW COUNTIES DON'T EVEN KNOW THE FULL SOME OF INDIVIDUALS HELD. SO THAT THEY COULD TRY AND CONNECT THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH SERVICES POST HOLD. AND IT SEEMS THAT PART OF YOUR RECOMMENDATION WAS REGARDING AS WELL THE MHSAA FUNDS AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES THAT. WE MAY NEED TO. PROVIDE SO THAT COUNTIES CAN USE THESE FUNDS FOR. THOSE AFTER THE L. P. S. ACTON HOPING. PROVIDING MORE. CONTRITE SO WE'RE WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEAVING LPS HOLDS BE IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY TARGET POPULATION UNDER THE MHA SAY AND THAT THE GOAL BE TO CONNECT THEM ALL WITH. POST HOLDS TREATMENT- THERE IS SORT OF A BRIGHT LINE IN THE IMAGE TO SAY RIGHT NOW ABOUT PAYMENT FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING A CHANGE TO THAT BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE POST HOLD CARE NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY UNDER THE AMBITIOUS I- SINCE WE- KERN. ARE RECEIVING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO OUT OF TWENTY WHO ARE RECEIVING RESOURCES POST LPS ACT OLD. IS THERE A GOAL WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AS A STATE AND WHAT TYPE OF TIME FRAME DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC GOAL- WE DID LOOK AT AS YOU SAID TO SORT OF RATE AT WHICH PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED TO POST HOLD CARE. WE LOOK AT THE WAY THAT- AND THE STATISTICS THAT YOU'RE CITING WE ALSO LOOKED AT JUST IN GENERAL NOT IN THE GLOBAL POPULATION BUT ALSO IMPROVE BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THE- SAMPLE THAT WE TOOK FIVE INDIVIDUAL CASE FILES REVIEW. WERE INDIVIDUALS AFTER THEIR HOLD IN THE TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING THEIR HOLD OFFERED ANY SERVICES AT ALL NOT JUST THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS OR THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT WHICH ARE THE MORE INTENSIVESERVICES BUT ANY KIND OF. CONTACT WITH THE COUNTY FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND FOUND SORT. POOR RATES OF CONTACT POST HOLD JUST FOR EVEN ANY OFFER OF SERVICES SO WE DON'T HAVE A GOAL SPECIFICALLY BUT CERTAINLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW DOESN'T APPEAR SUFFICIENT. I WILL IN MY QUESTIONS IF I CAN JUST BY COMMENTING THAT THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE LPS AFTER ALL. OF THIS IS A SYSTEMS ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. RECEIVING THE RESOURCES BETTER COORDINATION AMONG SO MANY PARTNERS AND- THANK YOU- STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWLE FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR STATE AND WE ARE GOING TO MISS YOU. THANK YOU THANK AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ECHO DR AMBULANCE THANKS TO OUR STATE AUDITOR- AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT- MANY PEOPLE THINK OF YOU AS MY DOPPELGANGER- ME AS YOURS AND WE HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR EACH OTHER UPON UPON MANY OCCASION BY EVEN BY SOME OF MY PEERS AND I'M ALWAYS HONORED WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY SAY I WAS GREAT AT A HEARING THAT I KNOW THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO ME- SO THANK YOU SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL CERTAINLY MISS YOUR SERVICES- AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS WELL AS WERE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND I AND I- AND I HEAR MR. MIGHT BE PURE MISTER STONES QUESTIONS- AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS LOOKING TO YOU KNOW HOLD MORE PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS LOOKING TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN OUR IS DISTRESSED AS THE PUBLIC BY WHAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE STREETS- I WOULD I WOULD SAY WITHOUT EXCEPTION THAT IS EVERYBODY'S GOAL- AND IN THE MORE OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT IT AND THE MORE. YOU KNOW BECOMES QUITE APPARENT THAT WE HAVE A HUGE BREAKDOWN OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM I THINK YOU KNOW TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE RIGHT AT THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO DO IT- AND WE'VE GIVEN THE CAN IS A TON OF MONEY TO DO IT I MEAN BOTH OF BOTH THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE AND SO CLEARLY THERE'S A DISCONNECT AND A BREAK DOWN AT SOME LEVEL- THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF- OF STEP DOWN CARE OF STEP DOWN FUNDING OF STEPPED OUT HOUSING- WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED- THE WHOLE. THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE WE'VE ALL TALKED TO MOTHERS. WHO ARE MOTHERS OF. FORTY FIFTY YEAR OLD OF CHILDREN WHO ARE STUPID CAT OFFSPRING WHO ARE STILL. STRUGGLING TO FIND SAFE PLACES TO LIVE DESPITE BEING ON OUR SYSTEM. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR ADULT LIVES AND THAT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY- SO I THINK I THINK WHAT WE WERE ALL JUST COMING DEEPER AND DEEPER TO REALIZE IS. IS A WELL L. PS MAY NOT BE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM IT HAS SERVED AS A SOLUTION FOR SOME. IN A TEMPORARY FASHION BUT IT IS ONLY. FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF TIME AND UNLESS WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. AS I WOULD LIKE TO I THINK WE HAVE AS A AS A SOCIETY AS A STATE WE HAVE FAILED. ON TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT STEP DOWN CARE THAT IS SO NEEDED. I THINK WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE COMMUNITY. THE COUNTIES ARE TELLING US THEY CAN'T GET THINGS LICENSE THEY CAN'T GET THAT PERMIT FROM THE STAFF AT THE STATE THEY CAN'T. ALL THESE BARRIERS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING FROM THE STAFF FROM THE STATE. STATE TELLING US THERE THERE'S NO BACKLOG THERE'S NO. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND- SO IT'S POLICYMAKERS WE SET UP HERE AND SCRATCH YOUR HEAD. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LOOKING TO KICK DOWN BARRIERS IF WE POSSIBLY CAN. TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND SO I CAN THINK WE KEEP COMING BACK TO THE SAME POINT LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT. THEN THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING BESIDES THE I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO DECISION ON THE GOVERNOR THE- STATE OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH AT LEAST THERE WAS SOME KIND OF BACKSTOP- AND I'M NOT ABOVE LIKE SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE. FOR TEMPORARY TIME WE GO BACK AND BE ABLE TO JUST. I MEAN. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. IN EVERYBODY'S COUNTY IT IS IT IS. WE SHOULD NOT. HAVE TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BECAUSE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE. IT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR OR BEING HELD AGAINST HER WILL THAT'S ALREADY FAR DOWN THE LINE. THAT IS ALREADY FAR DOWN THE LINE. IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THOSE ARE IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW ON THE FRONT END. ESPECIALLY AS WE KNOW THE CRISIS COMING UP RIGHT NOW IN OUR SCHOOLS AND- AND WITH OUR KIDS SO. I GUESS NOW I'M REALLY NOT BE LANE HOME BECAUSE I'M NOT BEING DIRECT AT ALL- BUT JUST TO SAY. I THINK ALL OF US ARE DEDICATED AND CERTAINLY INVESTED- NOT JUST TO EXPAND LPS THAT IS NOT ANYBODY'S GOAL JUST TO EXPAND THE- AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WERE HOLDING AGAINST THEIR WILL. OUR GOAL. IS TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN NOT REACH THAT LEVEL. AND TO BE ABLE TO LEAD A GOOD EFFECTIVE LIVE SO I THINK ALL OF US WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION AND OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT- I THINK I THINK THE COUNTIES AND I ARE GOING TO. WE'RE GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER A WHOLE LOT THIS THIS COMING YEAR. ABOUT HOW THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT. I THINK THE IDEA I HAVE BEING- PERHAPS IMAGES A AND TOTALING AND THAT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE LOOK AT ALL THOSE STEP DOWNS AND- I DID A PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR FOR SIXTY FIVE THAT WHAT WE REALLY LOOK. AT AND WHERE ALL OF THAT BUT BUDGET MONEY IS GOING- BECAUSE WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY- IN OUR- IN OUR CARE OF PEOPLE IN OUR POLITICS AND- EVERYTHING AND IT'S- I THINK. INCUMBENT UPON US TO REALLY GET THIS RIGHT. AGAIN IT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HISTORIC AMOUNT OF MONEY LET US ALL PLEASE USE IT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO HELP AS. MANY PEOPLE. AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BACK TO THE KIDS GREAT WELL THANK YOU AND I WANT TO SAY YOU TO- FOR YOUR SERVICE- MUCH APPRECIATE YOU ARE ACTUALLY- YOU TWO WERE- ACTUALLY- MISIDENTIFIED EARLIER TODAY BY SOMEBODY SO IT CONTINUES RIGHT UP TO THE RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT HERE I HAVE TO SANTA CLARA SO BUT- JUST APPRECIATE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE APPROACH THIS AUDIT HAS LED TO LEGISLATION WHICH I BELIEVE HAS HAS IS HAS AND IS. AND WILL MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM BUT- OBVIOUSLY. OBVIOUSLY WE HEAR IT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND- AND- AND IT IT AND SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE MORE SAY SEE THEY FEEL MORE INTRACTABLE- AND PART OF IT FROM I'LL KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS IS THE SORT OF. THE FEELING OF A LACK OF COORDINATION- THROUGH THIS AND- SOMEBODY I DON'T CARE WHO AND WHY DO CARE OF ACTUALLY ABOUT. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE IN YOU KNOW OR SOME ENTITY WHETHER IT'S A COMMISSION OR WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE- MORE ACTIVELY- ENGAGED IN A LEADERSHIP LEVEL- TO. TO HELP SOLVE SOME OF THESE INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THANK YOU AGAIN. TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR RE EMPHASIZING THAT SO THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MEMBERS IT'S BEEN AN HONOR. OKAY OKAY- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON INTERNET PANEL AND- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GENERATE A LOT OF INTEREST AMONG MEMBERS AND I AND I. AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS AND I'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL AS WELL. SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS NEXT ROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A LIGHTNING ROUND- FOR THE FOLKS THERE. AND SO- IS- IS ALEX IN THE RIVER YEAH COME ON UP TO THE COME ON UP HERE. SO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THIS PANEL TO FOCUS ON IN THEIR AND THEIR FIVE MINUTE REMARKS SO. IS WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES- TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS AND WHAT ARE THE PAIN POINTS WHERE WHERE ARE YOU FINDING THAT THIS IS THAT THE VEHICLES WHICH WHICH MAY BE RELATED BUT IT MAY NOT- SO WHERE IS AND WE'RE AND WE'RE GONNA- ACTUALLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE FIRST THOUGH. YOUR TALISMAN APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE HERE. WE GOT ONE WE'RE GOING TO STAY THERE STAY THERE DON'T ME. WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S OUT OF THE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO IS GOING TO SPEAK SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE JULIA WALLACE UP TO THE TOP OF THE LIST. FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN- SO- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I MISS WALLACE. HELLO ALL RIGHT. SORRY I'M LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO. START THE VIDEO AS WELL OKAY GREAT- YES MY NAME IS. JULIA WALLACE I'M A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER AND I'M SPEAKING AS A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY ONE. I REALLY WANT TO THANK. BOTH OF THOSE SPEAKERS OF RELATED EXPERIENCE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THAT IT WAS VERY BELL HOOKS AND APPRECIATE IT- SO I WANTED TO SPEAK AS A WORKER I'VE WORKED AT HAVE OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH PEOPLE- WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THEM WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES I ALSO ASSISTED. PEOPLE WHO BEEN- WHO HAVE BEEN PUT ON HOLD ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR THAT I'M THINKING OF- THE AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS CAUSED THEM TO. COMMIT ASSAULTIVE AND VIOLENT BEHAVIORS- BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE WORKED WITH. EVEN THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES WHO WERE NOT NECESSARILY MED COMPLIANT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND CONSERVATORSHIP FOR THOSE FOLKS ARE WOULDN'T THINKING CONSERVATORSHIP WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE'S SO MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE REPEAT- USING HOSPITALS- AND REPEAT HOSPITALIZATIONS SOME OF THEM ARE BECAUSE WHEN THE FOLKS ARE PUT ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. OFTENTIMES THAT. BIG BABY FEEL BETTER THAN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE PUT ON HOLD BUT IT REALLY WASN'T EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND SOME OTHER PARTICIPANTS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THAT- WHAT A LARGER ISSUE I THINK IS. IN THE IDEA OF EXPANDING L. P. S. WHERE IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IS THE STAFFING. PEOPLE HAVE MANY KINDS OF IDEAS A POLICY BUT FRANKLY WE'RE FACING THE GREAT RESIGNATION WITH IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- ARE LEAVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT BEING PAID ENOUGH BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE FACING THEIR OLD MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH A VERY STRESSFUL JOB. INCREASING CASELOADS AND SO THERE ISN'T EVEN THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO SERVE MANY OF THESE POPULATIONS I WORK IN SERVICE AREA FOR I HAD- WHICH IS WHERE IN LOS ANGELES- WHICH IS SKIDROW CREEK TOWN NEED CITY- DOWNTOWN. AND YOU KNOW MY TEAM WAS ELEVEN PEOPLE AND NOW IT'S ONE THAT'S ME. SO HOW THEN ARE THOSE FOLKS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO ROLL OUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE I DON'T. I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMITTEE OF WORKERS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR REALLY MAKING THESE DECISIONS O REALLY AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID HAVE SOMETHING BE EFFECTIVE TO HELP PEOPLE NOT JUST HOUSING THEM OUR WAREHOUSING THEM- WHICH I FEAR IS SOME OF. NOT NECESSARY PEOPLE HERE BUT MY FEAR IS THAT IT'S LIKE WELL THERE'S A HOMELESS PROBLEM SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SO WE'LL JUST. PUT PEOPLE SOMEWHERE AND REALLY WE WANT TO HEAL PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT TO JUST PUT THEM SOMEWHERE WE DON'T JUST MAKE IT EASIER TO PUT PEOPLE SOMEWHERE WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY ARE HEALING SO THAT THEY AREN'T JUST IN A CYCLE BUT THEY'RE GETTING BETTER AND THAT MEANS. HAVING MORE WORKERS THAT MEANS THAT HAVING MORE STAFF THAT MEANS HAVING WORKERS WHO ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT. AND IN ALL LEVELS NOT JUST OUTREACH WORKERS BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THESE HOSPITALS. AND FURTHERMORE A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE IN MY EXPERIENCE JUST CHARGED- SOON BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME THEIR MEDIC CAL SO. FIRST SOME PRIVATE PLACES THEY WOULD RATHER JUST. DISCHARGED THEM- AND THEN THEY JUST COME BACK THEY COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND AGAIN SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED HOSPITALS FIVE. TEN TIMES IN A YEAR MAYBE MORE- BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED CONSERVATORSHIP THEY NEED A MORE ROBUST AND HOLISTIC APPROACH WHICH MEANS MORE WORKERS WHICH MEANS. LESS CASELOADS WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY ABLE TO GIVE THE CARE AND COMPASSION THAT THEY HAVE. THE COWORKERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH ARE INCREDIBLY CONTENT AND UNDERSTANDING AND GO THE EXTRA MILE FOR OUR CLIENTS BECAUSE THEY CARE. BUT THEY'RE PUSHED OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE EXHAUSTED. AND IT PUSHED OUT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CAPACITY AND PLACES THAT EXIST THAT NEED TO REALLY. SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. CONSERVATORSHIP IT'S NOT A NOT A CATCH ALL. OF ME AND TO CONSERVE PEOPLE REALLY HAVE TO MEAN THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND INCREDIBLY- GREGIS WAY- THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY LOSE THEIR LIVES AND IF. THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUT IN THE FACILITY IT NEEDS TO BE A FACILITY THAT'S CARING AND COMPASSIONATE AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWORKED THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE PAID OFF THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO TAKING CARE. AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY SO I WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT I APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SAID MANY OF THOSE I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH- JUST LASTLY THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT HAVING HOMES- HOME BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE USE THE TERM HOMELESS IT CAN SEEM. INHUMANE JUST LIKE THIS IS A PROBLEM RATHER THAN THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND ADDRESSED. ALL RIGHT THE OTHER ISSUE REALLY IS HOUSING AND HOUSING P. AND PEOPLE HAVING HOUSING AND BEING ABLE TO AFFORD WHERE THEY LIVE. IF THAT ISN'T ADDRESS THEN THERE WILL BE MORE THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS THEY TEND TO HAVE MORE MENTAL ILLNESSES BECAUSE THE FACT OF BECOMING HOMELESS IS ITSELF TRAUMATIZING. SO- PLEASE TAKE THESE INTO CONSIDERATION I THINK IT COMMITTEE NEEDS TO BE FORMED ESPECIALLY WITH THE WORKERS WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND SO MUCH MORE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND- ALONG WITH PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY TO REALLY DO WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY WANTING TO DO WHICH IS TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. AND TO HELP THEM BE WHOLE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE'LL GO. AHEAD MOVED ON TO- THE STRAFFORD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE. CHAIRS OUT HAWTHORN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOSPITALS ARE ON THE FRONTLINES CARING FOR CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THIS INCLUDES THIRTY THREE FREESTANDING PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AND HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DEDICATED PSYCHIATRIC UNITS INSIDE OF GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS THIS IS A TOTAL OF OVER A THOUSAND INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS. IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO INCLUDES OVER THREE HUNDRED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WHICH ACT AS A SAFETY NET PROVIDERS FOR THOSE IN CRISIS OR WITH SIMPLY NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. STATEWIDE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ON ANY GIVEN DAY ARE ADMITTED TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. ALL TOLD CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS SEE MORE THAN ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS WITH THE PAPER HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IN THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS EVERY YEAR EXACERBATED THESE CHALLENGES FOR OUR PATIENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES ARE HOSPITAL SIR. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG ADULTS NEARLY QUADRUPLED BETWEEN MID TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MORE THAN 41% OF AMERICAN ADULTS REPORTED SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND WE'RE DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AND EVEN MORE CONCERNING AS YOU'VE ALL BEEN READING IN THE NEWSOVERDOSE DEATHS ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. YOU SUICIDE RISK HAS RISEN TO ALARMING LEVELS ARE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR SUSPECTED SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AMONG YOUTH JUST AGES TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN. OR MORE THAN 31% HIGHER. N TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY NINETEEN. WHEN YOU PAIR THIS WITH THE FACT THAT STAFF IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS NURSES DOCTORS TAX AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK FOR TWO YEARS TO STAVE OFF THE PANDEMIC THE NEED FOR RELIEF IS GOING DESPERATE. SO IT'S WITH THESE CHALLENGES AS A BACKDROP THAT THE INTENTION OF THE L. P. S. ACT WE BELIEVE IS JUST AS RELEVANT AND IMPORTANT AS WHEN IT WAS SIGNED FIFTY FOUR YEARS AGO. TO INAPPROPRIATE INDEFINITE AND INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS. TO PROVIDE PROMPT EVALUATION AND TREATMENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECT THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS. PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED CARE WHILE SAFEGUARDING CIVIL RIGHTS. AND TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR PROTECTING RIGHTS AND PROVIDING CARE. UNFORTUNATELY THE LACK OF STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR PROTECTING RIGHTS AND PROVIDING CARE IS AT THE ROOT OF MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WE SEE IN IMPLEMENTING THE LPS ACT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AREAS IN CARRYING OUT THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY PROCESS THAT COUNTIES LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS AND JUDGES HAVE TO INTERPRET ON THEIR OWN. THESE INCONSISTENCIES CREATE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS AND MEAN THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT ZIP CODE YOU LIVE IN. THE TREATMENT OF PROCESS SEES WILL DIFFER HERE SOME EXAMPLES. THE PROCESS FOR FACILITIES AND INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS TO BECOME LPS DESIGNATED WITH INVOLUNTARY HOLDEN ASSESSMENT POWERS VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. IN SOME COUNTIES PSYCHIATRIST AND EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS. ARE DESIGNATED TO WRITE AND RELEASE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLTZ AND OTHERS THEY ARE NOT. IN SOME CASES THE PROCESS TO DESIGNATE A FACILITY OR INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER CAN BE EXPEDIENT AND OTHERS IT CAN LINGER ON FOR YEARS. IN SOME CASES THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR CLOCK ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD BEGINS WHEN THE PERSON IS INITIALLY DETAINED AND OTHERS IT BEGINS WHEN THEY ARRIVE TO DESIGNATED FACILITY AND THE BACKGROUNDER THE COMMITTEE DID DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OUTLINING THAT ISSUE. FINALLY IN SOME CASES A PERSON'S PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITION CAN BE CONSIDERED BY A COURT WHEN MAKING A DETERMINATION FOR LONGER INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. OTHER PLACES IT CANNOT AND WE THANK CENTER EGGMAN FOR EFFORTS IN THAT SPACE INCONSISTENCIES CREATE BACKLOGS FOR ALREADY CROWDED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. AS AN EXAMPLE MORE THAN 75% OF ALL FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS CAN BE SAFELY RELEASED WITHIN TWENTY THREE HOURS. AND LESS THAN 25% RESULT AND ADMISSION TO AN INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SETTING. BUT THE BOTTLENECKS CREATED BY INCONSISTENT STANDARDS TOO OFTEN LEAVE THESE PATIENTS LANGUISHING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WAITING ON DESIGNATED INDIVIDUALS FROM OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TO COME AND ASSESS THEM. ONLY TO BE RELEASED LONG AFTER THE ORIGINAL THE TENSION. SURE WOULD YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD MANY OF THESE ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO ACTIVE- NO ONE ACTIVELY OVERSEEING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT. STRONG CONSISTENT LEADERSHIP IS NECESSARY TO BETTER PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. AND IMPROVE THE STATEWIDE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO TRACK DATA. PROCESS TO RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AND ADVISE THE COURTS THAT'S WHY WE WERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE THIS YEAR WITH THE EMMY CALIFORNIA AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN. THAT WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED DEDICATED LEADERSHIP POSITION WITHIN DH CS TO PERFORM SOME OF THESE FUNCTIONS UNFORTUNATELY THAT BILL WAS VETOED- ALTHOUGH WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CAN HELP THE LEGISLATURE. MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO DELIVER A BETTER SYSTEM FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HOPPER VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- WILL MOVE ON TO A VERONICA KELLY DIRECTOR SAN BENITO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- WITH THE COUNTY COUNTY OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS ASSOCIATION SO- MISS KELLY. I THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIRS AND MEMBERS AND- GOOD MORNING AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DR RON KELLY I AM THE DIRECTOR OF SAN BENITO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND IN THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. MY COMMENTS TODAY YOU'RE REALLY GONNA BE CENTERED ON THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NET FACES AND SERVING. PEOPLE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE THOSE WHO AT SOME POINT IN THEIR RECOVERY JOURNEY MAY BE INVOLUNTARILY HELD INVOLUNTARILY TREATED OUT AND OUR CONCERT AND SO FIRST THING I WANT TO LET ALL OF YOU KNOW IS THAT RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE. I SAY THIS AS A CLINICIAN AND AS A FORMER CONSERVATOR. FOR A FAMILY MEMBER THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED YEAR LAKE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT A. O. T. THE SECRET TECH COUNTY SUCCESS IS FAR LESS. OFTEN IN THE COMPULSORY AREA OF IT SO NOT JUST THE BLACK ROBE FACT BUT MORE OFTEN IT'S IN THE RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT. PEOPLE EIGHT LACK INSIGHT INTO THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS OR HAVE A MISTRUST OF INSTITUTIONS WHETHER IT'S A MEDICAL INSTITUTION OR ITS GOVERNMENT. ASSEMBLY DINO COUNTY WE FOUND OUR NHS EIGHT INNOVATIONS PROJECT CALLED OF RECOVERY BASED ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT TEAMS. OUR BEST WHICH IS OUR LARA'S LA TO QUIBBLE MEANT THAT IT TAKES AN AVERAGE OF FORTY FOUR ZERO FACE TO FACE VISITS WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T INTERESTED IN SERVICES ALTHOUGH THEY PROBABLY NEED THEM ALTHOUGH THEY DEFINITELY NEED THEM. TO GET THEM TO VOLUNTARILY ACTIVATE INTO TREATMENT WE HAVE A 90% ACTIVATION ONCE WE ARE ENGAGING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT REDUCES THE DRAMATIC ENTRY INTO OUR SYSTEM OF CARE IT REDUCES THE IDEA OF TAKING AWAY ALL SIMILAR. WE NEED IN MY COUNTY. WE CAN WE DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY. WE KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR THE INDIVIDUALS WE CONTACT WHO ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING INTO SERVICES. TOO OFTEN INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS CYCLING BETWEEN OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS HOMELESSNESS AND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT'S TRAUMA UPON TRAUMA UPON TRAUMA. WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE FAILURE AND IT'S NOT ONE ENTITIES PROBLEM IT'S ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. THIS GOES ACROSS SYSTEMS. OUR SYSTEMS THAT DON'T COMMUNICATE WHILE WE DON'T COORDINATE EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH WITH ONE ANOTHER WE OFTEN MISSED CRUCIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH THE URGENCY AND COMPASSION THAT THEY DESERVE AND THAT THEY NEED FOR EXAMPLE. TODAY KIND OF A HERO HEALTH MAY NOT KNOW THAT SOMEONE WE ARE WORKING WITH IT'S IN A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR- IS BEING IS EXPERIENCING A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY BECAUSE WE AND OUR OTHER HEALTH PLANS ARE OTHER PARTNERS ARE OFTEN NOT NOTIFY. BY THE HOSPITAL OR BY THE PATIENT THE PATIENT MIGHT NOT NOT BE ABLE TO TELL THE HOSPITAL THAT THEY ARE ONE OF OUR CLIENTS I'M PROBABLY CHALLENGES OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. HAS DECIMATED OUR ABILITY TO KEEP OUR CLIENTS SAFELY HOUSE AND CREATING MARK IT'S CREATED MORE HEALTH AND JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT RISK FOR OUR CLIENTS. THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED IN THIS FIELD AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND I MANAGED INDIVIDUALS. WHO WERE IN THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM WHO HAD VARIOUS LEVELS OF CRIMINAL GENIC RESTAURANT ELEMIS COMMUNITY BASED OR IN CARE. TO HELP US SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERT. IN COMMUNITY. WHILE WE PROVIDED THE TARGETED BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT. AS HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE PRICES HAVE ESCALATED. WE STARTED TO LOSE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES NOT COMMUNITY ANYMORE IN RESPONSE COUNTIES HAVE USED EVERYTHING WE- ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING OUR BLOCK GRANT FUNDING R. NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TO TRY TO BUILD AND BY HOUSING FOR CLIENTS SOMETIMES THAT MEANS WE DIVERT FUNDING FROM DESPERATELY NEEDED EXPANSION OF SERVICES SUCH AS OUR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. OR THAT WE ARE PAYING OUR PROVIDERS AS WELL BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING HOUSES. ALL OF THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HOUSING HELPS PEOPLE HEAL IT KEEPS OUR CLIENTS SAFE AND OUT OF THAT CYCLE THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE THIS MORNING OF CRIMINALIZATION THAT CAN TRAUMATIZE AND INTERRUPT THEIR RECOVERY. DESPITE THESE INVESTMENTS WE STILL LACK SUFFICIENT INVESTMENT AND RESOURCES TO SAFELY HOUSE ALL OF OUR CLIENTS I WANT TO BE CLEAR IT'S NOT ABOUT MORE MONEY IT'S ABOUT MORE RESOURCE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE HOUSE OUR CLIENTS WE ARE TRYING AND WE KNOW THAT DISCRIMINATION **** BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT ALREADY KNOW HOW MORE ABOUT IN ACCESSING IN BUILDING HOUSING- AND TREATMENT FACILITIES ALL TOO REAL TO DOCTOR RECKLESS POINT A LEVEL OF NIMBYISM. IN OUR COUNTIES. THAT WE EXPERIENCED IT SHAMEFUL. WHEN SEEKING TREATMENT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS ARE FREQUENTLY REJECTED FROM TREATMENT FACILITIES FROM TREATMENT FACILITIES. BECAUSE OF SOME. EARNERS ON HOSPITAL SAY THAT THE CLIENTS PASSED CRIMINAL BACKGROUND AND TAX ABILITY TO BE TREATED IN THE AND THE FACILITY THEY CAN'T HAVE A FELONY. THAT THEY HAVE PAST AGGRESSIONS AND THAT THEY'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE TREATED. THIS MAKES THEM UNSUITABLE FOR SOME OF OUR PARTNERS FOR OPEN BEDS UNSTABLE FOR THE TREATMENT THEY NEED AND THE TREATMENT THEY WANT AND WHILE WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONSHE JUST HEARD ON THIS WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US. OUR RESOURCES ARE FURTHER STRETCH BY FEDERAL LAW WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW FUNDING OF RESIDENTIAL AND ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. IMPOSSIBILITIES THE HUB OVER SIXTEEN BEDS. IT'S I AM D. EXCLUSION AND THAT MEANS THAT WE PAY THE FULL COST OF TREATMENT AND WE USE WHATEVER FUNDING WE CAN USE FOR THAT EVER HEALTH SAFETY NET FUNDING FOR SERVICES HAS SIMPLY NOT KEPT PACE WITH CLIFORNIA'S GROWING POPULATION AND ARE INCREASED MEDIC HOW ENTITLEMENTS. IT DOESN'T KEEP UP WITH CASELOAD GROWTH IMPACT FUNDING FOR THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEED HAS DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME WE OFTEN REALIZE THEY SAID ON NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TO FIND LPS ACTIVITIES AS IT'S ALMOST FLEXIBLE FUNDING SOURCE ANDTHERE IS SCANT DEDICATED FUNDING FOR LPS SERVICES IN. TWENTY TWENTY WE USED OUR NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. AT IT WAS LOWER IN NINETY AND I. TWENTY TWENTY THAT ONCE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE IN ACTUAL DOLLARS. WE HAVE SOME COUNTIES THAT SPEND ALL OF THEIR NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. ON ON INPATIENT TREATMENT AND I LIKE HOW OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED IN REALIGNMENT THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK FROM MENTAL HEALTH BETWEEN FUNDING AND ACTUAL SERVICE COST THAT MEANS THE MONEY WE GET IS NOT BASED ON WHAT IT ACTUALLY. COSTS TO DELIVER AT SERVICE INSTEAD FINDING IS BASED ON HOW MUCH COUNTY SPENT ON MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. I MEAN COLBERT HAS TAUGHT US A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TAUGHT US THE IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND RECOVERY SO WE MUST ACT NOW TO CHANGE THAT. CAN BE HERE HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND TO CITY MUNICIPALITIES ARE GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE. FOR CONSIDERING THIS TOPIC OF LPS REFORM. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE ROOT OF THE CHALLENGE WE FACE- ARE IN A CHRONIC DECADES LONG UNDER FUNDING A LACK OF HOUSING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND A LACK OF STATE LEVEL DATA AND TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE WORK DETAIL. A BROADENING OF INVOLUNTARY. COMMITMENT WILL NOT TOUCH THIS. WHAT WE DO TO IS TO X. WARNING CARE. WITH OUT THAT. BEING BASED ON COMPETITIVE GRANTS. WE WOULD LOVE HOUSING THAT THERE IS A STATEWIDE PURE BENEFIT AS YOU'VE HEARD PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE EXPRESSED YOU HERE TODAY. AUGMENTED TREATMENT SERVICE DOLLARS THOSE ARE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT INVESTMENTS THAT EXPAND THE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF OUR OUR STATE YOU KNOW I FEEL- INDUCTOR RAMBLING HEARD ME SAY THIS A FEW TIMES WHAT WE ARE ALL SITTING IN DIFFERENT WINGS OF THIS WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE THAT COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON. IN DOWNSTAIRS AND THE DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR AND CALIFORNIA HOSPITALIZATION ASSOCIATION IS ON THE FRONT PORCH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS AN UPSTAIRS BACK BEDROOM AND THEN YOU HAVE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT SITS IN THE HALLWAY WITH NO ENTRANCES OR EXITS. MAYBE PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS TEARING DOWN THIS. SO THAT WE'VE IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT OUR NEXT PANELIST AND I WOULD JUST WE ARE DARK TIMES A LITTLE TIGHTER SO PLEASE- FIVE MINUTES AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT- BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD- DR- JUST ON THIS TOPIC IS INSTANT. SYSTEM HEAR AN ECHO. OF ARE A CLINICAL PROFESSOR FROM. OF MEDICINE DOCTOR AND SEE WHATEVER READY. ALL THE UC DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEM AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE HOSPITAL MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. I WOULD BOOK IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ASSESSING INDIVIDUALS IN MENTAL HEALTH WHEN I MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THEY ALSO WORK IN AN ACUTE CARE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. I EVALUATE AND TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ON A DAILY BASIS AND MY PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO HOPEFULLY SHOW YOU WHAT I SEE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. IN MY WORK ASSESSING AND TREATING PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND HOPEFULLY INFORM YOU ON GAPS RELATED TO TREATMENT AS THEY RELATE TO LPS. OUR UNDERSTANDING FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS TREATMENT HAS ADVANCED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE LPS BECAME OPERATIVE. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT MENTAL ILLNESSES LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR DISORDER. OR ILLNESSES OF THE BRAIN. AND IN THAT RESPECT THERE ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM MEDICAL DISORDERS AFFECTING OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. HOWEVER WHAT EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS HAVE ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY PSYCHOSIS AS EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IS STILL VERY PAINFUL AND FRIGHTENING. IMAGINE TRYING TO FUNCTION IN DOING YOUR WORK IF YOU BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO KILL YOU. IMAGINE BEING SO HUNGRY BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T EATEN DAIS. BUT YOU DON'T TRUST THE FOOD IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE POISONED. IMAGINE HEARING VOICES SO LOUD THAT YOU CANNOT SLEEP. IT'S NOT PLEASANT AND IT'S VERY DISTRESSING. THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION OF PSYCHOSIS THAT DIFFERS FROM OTHER MEDICAL DISORDERS MENTAL CAPACITY MENTAL ILLNESS ROB SAYS ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND ABILITY TO KNOW REAL FROM NOT REAL. HEART DISEASE BY CONTRAST DOESN'T ROUTINELY AFFECT ONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS A HEART ATTACK IS VERY APPARENT YOU WANT HELPING YOU WANT NOW NO ONE DOUBTS OR QUESTIONS YOU NEED FOR TREATMENT AND NO ONE BRINGS INTO AN NSF TO DECISION MAKER OR NEEDS A COURT ORDER. IN MENTAL ILLNESS HOWEVER THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO EXERCISE INSIGHT IS IMPAIRED THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR MIND IS CONTROLLED BY DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS IS LACKING IN THE IMPULSE TO SEEK OUT HELP IS DIMINISHED. OR ALTOGETHER ABSENT THE INDIVIDUAL OFTEN BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THEM UP DISTRUSTING MEDICATIONS NOT ONLY PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION BUT LIFESAVING ONES THE ONES THAT THEY NEED TO TREAT A COLD DURING OUR CONDITION OR DIABETES. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GRAVELY DISABLED. AND THAT'S TRAGIC. LPS OPENS THE DOOR TO EVALUATE. AND DIAGNOSE PATIENTS LPS ALLOWS PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AN OPPORTUNITY PER TREATMENT. BUT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY SLACKING THERE IS A SERIOUS RISK OF HARM TO THE PATIENT. WHEN THE CAPACITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IS IMPAIR THE LPS PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER AND THE COURT IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT INFORMED DECISION ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENT'S WELFARE IS MADE. HOWEVER THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BECAUSE TREATMENT ON A ROUTINE BASIS. IS DELAYED OR WORSE THE NIGHT. DATA SUGGESTS THAT THAT IF WE TREAT PSYCHOSIS EARLY ON. WE CAN DRAMATICALLY SHORTEN ACUTE EPISODES. WHEN TREATMENTS PROVIDED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME WE OPTIMIZED EVENTUAL OUTCOME. UNFORTUNATELY THAT TIME THAT ELAPSED BETWEEN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE TENSION IN THE COMMUNITY IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TREATMENT IN AN INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. CAN ON AVERAGE BE SEVEN DAYS OR LONGER FOR A PATIENT REFUSING TREATMENT. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY DETAINING PATIENTS BUT NOT TREATING THEM. FOR PATIENTS REFUSING TREATMENT LPS PROVIDES A COURT PROCEDURE CALLED HERE REACHED HEARING. A RESPECT ISSUE IF THE COURT PROCEDURE TO EVALUATE THE PATIENT'S CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND HER ILLNESS AND THEIR CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO TREATMENT. IN THEORY THIS IS FINE THERE IS A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN LEGAL AND TREATMENT NEEDS. AND SECOND PSYCHIATRIST UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THIS VERY WELL BUT IN PRACTICE IS THE PROCESS IS COMPLICATED AND IN SOME SENSE SOMETIMES BAD THINGS HAPPEN. RECENT POSITIONS ARE LINKED TO LPS TO PAYMENT SO THAT SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY ON. ONCE THE COURT APPROVED THE INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT ONLY LAST UNTIL THE END OF THAT WHOLE. ONCE THE CURRENT HOLD EXPIRES AND IF THE PATIENT IS STILL ILL. ANOTHER CAPACITY HEARINGS REQUIRED IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL THAT CAPACITY HEARING IS ONCE AGAIN HURT. THE TREATMENT THAT WAS APPROVED INITIALLY BY THE COURT IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE. AND RISKS ACUTE DECOMPENSATION OF THE PATIENT. THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM. LET'S GO BACK THE INITIAL ONE WEEK DELAY PRIOR TO TREATMENT CAN BE VERY COSTLY. NOT ONLY FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT AS THE PATIENT IS IN THE HOSPITAL LONGER THAN THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT NEED TO BE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S COSTLY FROM A PATIENT'S FUNCTIONALITY STANDPOINT. DURING THAT ONE WEEK. I'VE SEEN PATIENTS END UP HURTING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE VOICES ARE TELLING THEM TO KILL THEMSELVES. THREE THAT ONE WEEK I'VE SEEN PATIENTS HURT OTHERS BECAUSE OF THEIR PARANOIA. BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IT TAKES A MUCH LONGER TO GET BACK TO THE BASELINE. DATA TELLS US THAT THE LONGER THAN THREE MINUTES THE LATE THE LONGER IT TAKES TO GET BACK TO THE WAY YOU WERE BEFORE YOU GOT SICK. SO THE PATIENT LOSES MORE TIME OFF FROM WORK. EMPLOYER IS AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR WORKERS. THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILY ARE DRASTICALLY AFFECTED. THE LPS ACT MADE US AWARE THAT PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS ARE DEVASTATING HIS ORDERS THAT REQUIRE TREATMENT. IN A SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS BOTH AND INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS AND ALSO THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED. WELL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE INFORMED CONSENT. THIS STANDARD THE STANDARD CARE WITH ANY OTHER MEDICAL ILLNESSES TO TREAT DURING THE ACUTE STAGE OF THAT THIS ORDER ONCE THE DIAGNOSIS IS MADE. TREATMENT OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS AND OTHER MENTAL DISEASES SHOULD ALIGN WITH THIS OR SHOULD AT MOST BE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DIAGNOSIS. HOW WE MIGHT DELIVER EARLY INTERVENTIONS IN THESE ILLNESSES IS A CRITICAL MATTER WORTH DISCUSSING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR SYSTEM- WE WILL NOW GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE FINAL PANELIST IN THIS IN THIS PANEL- FRANK RYAN TO SAN JOSE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. SIR. THANK YOU ALL HEAR ME I I'M NOT GONNA VIDEO SOME TO PROBABLY SPEAKING. OKAY GREAT. ARE YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE INVITE. TO GIVE MY PERSPECTIVE AS A- BILL NUMBER OF TAKING CARE OF MENTAL PATIENTS OUT THERE. AGAIN MY NAME'S FRANK RYAN I WORK THIS SOUNDS A FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS- IN THAT ASPECT I'VE BEEN A PARAMEDIC- SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE- WE RUN ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS HERE IN SAN JOSE- AND YOU CAN IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT BREAKDOWN BUT SO MANY OF MENTAL ILLNESS- WE HAVE IN THE CITY AND WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS- OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR I. HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS OF FIELD EXPERIENCE- I'VE CHOSEN TO STAY IN THE FIELD WORK IN THE FIELD NOT TAKE DESK JOBS AND THINGS THAT- QUITE FRANKLY DON'T INTEREST ME. AND SO I HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAY- INVOLVED IN I'VE WATCHED A LOT OF CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- QUICK BACKGROUND AS WELL I'VE WORKED IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES SO BETWEEN RIVERSIDE COUNTY L. A. COUNTY AND NOW SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SAN JOSE- I CAN ATTEST THAT. EACH COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN WAYS OF DOING THINGS- SOME GOOD SOME BAD- I DON'T KNOW IF COUNTIES ARE COLLABORATING WITH THEIR SUCCESSES AND FAILURES- BUT IF THAT'S NOT HAPPENING I. I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE- THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE THEN THEY WE WOULD FIND A WAY TO BETTER THAT COMMUNICATION- AS WELL AS A LOT OF THE OTHER THINGS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT- SO FAR TODAY- BEFORE I TALK ABOUT EXACT EXPERIENCES- I LIKE TO SAY THAT- ALLOWED MEMBERS AND SPOKE AS SPECIAL JULIA WALLACE. NEVER MET HER BUT I WAS IMPRESSED BY- HER INSIGHTS AND SHE MADE A LOT OF BALLOT IN THE- GREAT POINTS- SO BEFORE I GET INTO THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN NINE ONE ONE IS CALLED WE- THE SYSTEM IS OBVIOUSLY FAILED THESE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE A CRISIS. LONG BEFORE WE SHOW UP AND SO. THAT IS SYSTEMS NEED TO BE REVAMPED EVERY LOOK THAT- EVERYTHING SHOULD BE BUILT I THINK BACK UP FROM THE BOTTOM- BECAUSE- WE'RE BEING CALLED OUT TO THESE CALLS. YEAH LIKE I SAID THAT THE CRISIS IS WAY BEYOND- WHAT THE SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED. THEM AND LIKE I SAID WAIT WHAT WHETHER IT'S FUNDING OR- WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH STAFFING IS UP FOR YOU GUYS TO DETERMINE ON EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION ON THAT THAT I'VE BEEN IN. FOUR EIGHT EIGHT INDIVIDUAL THAT. OBVIOUSLY IS SYSTEM HASN'T- ALLOW THEM TO SUCCEED IS WE WOULD WE RESPONDED TO A CALL TWO EIGHT MIDDLE AGED LADY WHO WAS. ARE FOUND IN A DUMPSTER AND SHE'S BASICALLY LIVING HER DAYS IN A DUMPSTER AND HOW MANY DAYS SHE WAS THERE IS UNKNOWN BUT WE'RE CALLED OUT TO THIS AND TO RESPOND TO THAT. SHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEET AN INJURY. THAT WE GENERALLY SEE FROM- A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT OR A HEART ATTACK IS AS WAS SAID EARLIER. AND SO DEALING WITH AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE THAT. IS A SENSITIVE MATTER- THE MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT BUT GETTING AN INDIVIDUAL OUT OF A DUMPSTER WHO IS HAVING A CRISIS AND TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ALL WATCHING WITH CELL PHONES AND HAVING THEIR OPINIONS AND- HOW TO DO THAT IS A IT'S A DELICATE MATTER AND HOW SHE GOT THERE IS THE TRAGIC PART OF ALL OF IT- AND THE SYSTEM IS OBVIOUSLY FAILED HER. AS WE REMOVE HER FROM THE DUMPSTER- AND- WHAT HE OUR SYSTEM IS WE ARE NOT A TRANSPORTING AGENCY HERE IN SAN JOSE SO WE TRANSFER THE CARE TO AN AMBULANCE. AND UPON ARRIVAL OF AN AMBULANCE WE EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OBVIOUS INJURIES AND SHE CAN ANSWER THE FOUR QUESTIONS. THAT WE ASK. THAT SOMETIMES. A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THIS MOMENT BUT I I'D LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE SAID THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY- THE NEED AND- SO WE TRANSPORT THEM TO THE AMBULANCE THE AMBULANCE THEN BRING HIM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS HAPPENS OVER AND OVER IN EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY AND THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND ER'S BECOME. OVER BURDENED WITH WITH PEOPLE HAVING MENTAL ILLNESS CRISIS IS AN ISIS SEEMS THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE AND THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE USE DOESN'T SEEM VERY EFFECTIVE AND TO GO FULL CIRCLE IT WAS PROBABLY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN HOURS AFTER- WE WERE ABLE TO. GET THE PATIENT TO GO IN THE M. S. ONE SHE WAS RIGHT BACK OUT ON THE STREET- AND SO- SOMEBODY IN THE HOSPITAL'S DETERMINED YOU KNOW WE ARE ON THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SIDE OF IT AREN'T. REALLY TRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS ONCE WE TRANSFER THE CARE. BUT WE SEE THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE SAME. PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME TYPE CRISIS IS AND THEN IT. IT USUALLY PROGRESSES TO THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHERE THE PATIENT IS NO LONGER HAVING A CRISIS THEY ARM THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT. THEY DON'T COME BACK FROM- BUT I ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MEDIA- D. A. A CALL WHERE THE SYSTEM. DIDN'T WORK AND THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD WAS PUT ON THEM. FOR THEIR FOR THEIR NEEDS- FOR HAVING ANXIETY ISSUES AND WE DID GET SOME FOLLOW UP IF THE SYSTEM DOES WORK AT TIMES- IT'S NOT ALL. DOOM AND GLOOM- BUT THERE IS A LOT OF. TRAGEDY AND THINGS THAT ARE BEING MISSED OUT HERE ON A DAILY BASIS- AND LIKE I SAID THAT WE EVERY HEALTH A HEALTH CARE WORKER HAS A STORY EVERY PARAMEDIC HAS THE STORY- IT IN THE STORIES JUST JUST. SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE AND GREATER IN NUMBER- SO. I WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME BUT I DO I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH OWN RATES IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE YOU KNOW A GREATER NUMBER OF MENTAL ILLNESS- AND WE OURSELVES ARE ABLE TO SERVE OUR AYE I ALSO WORK IN OUR UNION BOARD AND WE- ARE DIRECTLY IN IN CARE OF ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAVING. ISSUES OVERALL I THINK OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN AT TIMES BECAUSE WE DON'T. WHAT WERE WE ON THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AREN'T PUTTING THEM INTO THE FACILITY OR DIRECTING THEM TO THE FACILITY- INSTEAD WE ARE JUST TRANSFERRED TO AN AMBULANCE AN AMBULANCE TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEN WE HOPE FOR THE BEST FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD FIND UP REVAMP NOT ONLY THEY- THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BUT THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND HOW WE SHOULD BETTER SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS OTHER THAN. TRANSFERRING THEM TO- AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND- OVERWHELMING THOSE SYSTEMS SO HAVING A ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM- THAT SUPPORTS PATIENTS LONG. LONG BEFORE WE GET CALLED OUT THERE IS HOPEFULLY EIGHT EIGHT LARGE FOCUS AND THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER SYSTEM- BECAUSE- GETTING SOMEBODY THAT HELP THE PERMANENT SIDE. IT AND USING A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD IT SOMETIMES BECOMES EIGHT A GOTCHA SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUALS NOT REALLY TELLING US THEY WANT TO HARM THEMSELVES THEY'RE NOT REALLY- NO THEY DON'T HAVE A WEAPON AND WE'RE NOT. BUT THEY NEED HELP AND THEY NEED THE INTERVENTION AND AT TIMES WE FIND OURSELVES WELL THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY GET THIS INDIVIDUAL IN THIS AMBIENCE LEGALLY OR AND HELP THEM AS- WELL. I WATCHED PEOPLE TRY TO CONVINCE THEM TO IT SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WANT TO HARM THEMSELVES. AND IT'S REALLY A- AND ASSIST AT TIMES THAT THAT- CAN BE BETTER SERVED I THINK IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT WAY TO RESPOND- IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE RAPID INTERVENTION TEAMS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE IN A FIRE IN THE BUILDING COLLAPSES. WE HAVE A TEAM THAT COMES IMMEDIATELY TO SPECIALIZE IN HOW TO GET THE INDIVIDUALS. THAT WERE TRAPPED- IF WE HAD A SYSTEM. THAT COULD UP THAT WE COULD CALL IF WE'RE GOING TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE DON'T DO THAT THEY NEED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. WHO CAN WE CALL THEY'VE CALLED US TO HELP THEM BUT HOW HOW CAN WE GET THEM THE BEST HELP THE BEST FACILITY- FIRE DEPARTMENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THE BEST ACCESS TO ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY'RE IN CRISIS WE MEET THEM FIRST. WHEN THEY'RE HAVING THIS CRISIS BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ON TO THE BEST FACILITY TO THE BEST PEOPLE. THAT HARM- THE ABILITY TO. TO HELP THEM IN THEIR MOMENT OF CRISIS. SO WITH ALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE IN EVERY CITY AND ALL OUR FIRE ENGINES THAT GO TO THESE AND HAVE CONTACTS. IT SEEMS THAT IF WE GETTING THEM. THE RIGHT HELP WE CAN ELIMINATE THE CYCLE OF. AB MEMBERS AND SEE ROOMS. A FEW DAYS A COUNSELING IT BACK ON STREET- IT JUST SEEMS THAT CAN. STREAMLINE THIS BETTER TO BETTER SERVE- THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HAVING THESE- MOMENT CRISIS. THAT ULTIMATELY WE SEE IT EVERY% DAY. THAT IF NOT TREATED IF NOT. ANYTHING ELSE YES- USUALLY GOES TO A- NOT A GOOD OUTCOME FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS NOT LONG TERM. SO ON IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO ANSWER BUT- I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK GREAT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- ANY QUICK QUESTIONS FROM THE PANELISTS BEFORE WE- MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU I JUST I JUST KIND OF KIND OF SUMMARIZE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I HEARD THERE. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO CHALLENGES WITH ONE MORE SESSION WE CAN EXACERBATED BY COVE IT EXACERBATES. WE HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT- INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE- THAT WE SEE. THAT A COUNTY BY COUNTY LEVEL SO WHICH MAKES IT COMPLICATED FOR HOSPITALS WHO ARE DOING A LOT OF INTAKE HERE- WITH A LACK OF FACILITIES. FOR PEOPLE WHO DO TO GET CARE. THEY ALSO HEARD THERE'S A LACK OF MONEY ALTHOUGH WE PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM NOW- SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT. AND WE ALSO HEARD THAT YOU KNOW WHAT FIFTY ONE FIFTY CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT TOOL AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR PEOPLE THIS TOOL BEING USED PROBABLY IN. SOM CASES OUT OF DESPERATION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX SO. SIZE ONE I THINK THIS PANEL FOR- FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY. AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND- MR STONE IS GOING TO TAKE THE NEXT COUPLE PANELS SENATORS PEOPLE. THANK YOU SO CONTINUE IN WITH STAKEHOLDER. INPUT WILL NOW MOVE TO. WE HAVE. FOUR MEMBERS. CHIEF ABDUL PRIDGEN WHO IS WITH US REMOTELY. JOSEPH QUINN IN PERSON. SCARLET HUES IN PERSON AND TIFFANY MALES ARE NOT IN. PERCENT OF THOSE IN PERSON WOULD COME UP TO THE- TABLES IF THERE'S ROOM MAYBE A COUPLE AT A TIME. AND SO THE FIRST ONE IS REMOTE CHIEF PRIDGEN ARE YOU WITH US. I WAS TOLD HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MORNING SESSION. CHIEF PRIDGEN. OKAY IS THAT ALLIANCE I THINK HE WILL BE JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON. SO WILL THAT MOVE TO JOSEPH QUINN SUPERVISING. PROBATE JUDGE SERVICES BECAUSE THE COURT. YOU KNOW LIKE. WE HAVE TO. OKAY NOW WE DO WE DO NEED YOU TO THE MICROPHONE OTHERWISE WE DON'T GET A RECORDING. THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRS WOOD AND STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES AND SENATOR EGGMAN- THANK YOU FOR- EXTENDING AN INVITATION FOR TESTIMONY- TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- I AM A MEMBER OF THE- PROBATE IN MENTAL HEATH ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE JUDICIAL CUNCIL- AND- VOLUNTEERED. TO PROVIDE THE TESTIMONY- MY NAME IS JOE QUINN I AM AT- A JUDGE OF THE SENSES GOOD SECURE COURT AND- THE SUPERVISING JUDGE. OF THE PROBATE MENTAL HEALTH DIVISION OF THE COURT. SO FIRST I JUST. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE COURT'S ROLE- KIND OF ON A ON A STREET LEVEL- IS IN THE L. P. S. ACT- SO YOU KNOW LPS CONSERVATORSHIP SO OFTEN START WITH A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. AND THE COURTS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE ANY INVOLVEMENT- IN IN THAT STEP- THOSE HOLDS CAN- YOU CAN BE EXTENDED- AND THE COURT CAN HAVE A ROLE IN HOLDING A HEARING ON A CERTIFICATION. OR MEDICAL POWERS- OR OTHER REQUESTS THOSE- HEARINGS ARE HELD- WE HOLD THOSE HEARINGS- AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK OF COURSE TO. OUR EXPERIENCE REALLY IN SAM CISCO WE HELD THOSE HEARINGS AT TWELVE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN THE COMMUNITY- SO WE GO TO WHERE THE PATIENTS ARE- AND THOSE HEARING IT AT THOSE HEARINGS THE PATIENTS ARE REPRESENTED- AND BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND AND WE DO TO KATE THE REQUEST- AND THEN WOULD COME THE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP IF- THE MATTER ADVANCES TO THAT LEVEL AND THOSE. ARE ADDRESSED- AS THEY COME IN IT KIND OF THE EVERYDAY OF THE WEEK- AND- THERE ARE- RESULT ON THE ON THE PAPERS ON THE MEDICAL INFORMATION SUBMITTED AND- THE PETITION SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC CONSERVATORY. THEN THE COURT CONDUCTS THE HEARINGS ON PETITIONS FOR A CAN- CONSERVATORSHIP- AND- ALSO COULD BE A HEARING ON MEDICAL- POWER IS. ON MEDICATION POWER IS- OR YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF OTHER RELATED REQUESTS AND PETITIONS- SO AT THOSE HEARINGS- THE PUBLICAN SERVITOR THE CITY ATTORNEY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER- I SHOULD SAY BEFORE THOSE HEARINGS- ALL THOSE PARTIES COLLABORATE- TO PUT TOGETHER THE CASES- AND TO ASSEMBLE THE- CALENDAR. THE OUR CLERK'S OFFICE DEDICATES- SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PREPARING THE CALENDARS- AND THEN- THE WE HOLD THE CALENDARS- THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CALENDARS IS SEVERAL MATTERS ARE SUBMITTED ON THE PAPERS- AND IN THE PAPERS BEING YOU KNOW THE PETITION AND THE MEDICAL TESTIMONY- AND THE LIKE- AND THOSE ARE ARE ADDRESSED. FIRST THEN WE HEAR IT IN THE A. O. T. MATTERS- AND THE- IN THE C. I. P. P. PROGRAM- MATTERS THE I. P. P. IS ANOTHER. KIND OF- OUTPATIENT- PROGRAM IS EVERY RUN IN SAM CISCO- AND THEN WE HEAR THE CONTESTED MATTERS- SO THOSE ARE THE ONES WITH THE EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS- AND- THERE ARE. TYPICALLY A NUMBER OF THOSE- IT BUT. THE KEY TO I THINK THE WAY- THE- THE CALENDARS ARE HANDLED- SEEMS. IS THIS- RESOURCES THAT ARE PUT INTO YOU KNOW ORGANIZING THEM THE FRONT LOADED RESOURCES AND THE RESOURCES PUT INTO THEM- IT FOR HEARING- AND THE COOPERATION OF A LOT OF PARTIES- ME AND I MEAN YOU KNOW COURTS ARE- YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN. IN THE UNITED STATES AN ADVERSARIAL- PROCESS- BUT THERE IS A LOT OF COOPERATION- AND THERE'S AGREEMENT WHERE THERE CAN BE AGREEMENT- AND- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO THAT. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE HEMP AND ARE VERY MINDFUL OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM IN THEIR CISCO- IS MINDFUL OF THE IMPORTANT LIBERTY INTERESTS- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SILENT DRESS- AND- IT AND WE TRY TO KEEP TO KEEP TRACK OF THAT- ON EVERY CASE. FOR EVERY MATTER- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THE COURTS ARE RESPONSIVE- WE RESPOND TO PETITIONS WE RESPONDED TO REQUESTS AND WE- RESOLVE THEM- LARGELY ON THE ON THE RULES THEY HAVE- PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND ON THE EVIDENCE- THAT IT'S PRESENTED IN pISSUES THAT WE SEE AND I'LL BE BRIEF AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE IN THE AFTERNOON BUT- YOU FOR A LOT OF PLACEMENT PLACEMENT IS AN ISSUE WE SEE ALL THE TIME. THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT PORTION OF THE OF ANY- LPS GALLAGHER. IN ADDITION TREATMENTS- AND THEN LEGAL ISSUES ABOU. TIME LINES- THAT ARE YOU KNOW BUILT INTO THE L. P. S. ACT AND HOW PRACTICAL THEY ARE AND HOW WORKABLE THEY ARE. APPRECIATING THAT IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO SCARLET HUE. NINE FIFTY CENT. AND JUST PUSH THE RED BUTTON NEXT TO THE MICROPHONE THAT TO TURN IT OFF. THERE YOU GO OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M SCARLET HUES I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GARDENS AND PUBLIC SERVICE. OUR MEMBERS ARE THE COUNTY OFFICIAL APPOINTED. TO REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS FOUR POINT THE CONSERVATIVE. BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THEIR CARE THEIR DECISION MAKING- THEIR PROPERTY. AND DESPITE THE VARIOUS MANDATES PUT FORWARD IN STATE LAW OUR MEMBERS RECEIVE NO STATE FUNDING NO DEDICATED STATE FUNDING IN FACT AS NEAR AS WE CAN TELL. EXCUSE ME. WE'RE THE ONLY MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM THAT RECEIVES NO STATE FUNDING. AND AS THE ONLY MAJOR CALIFORNIA COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE SAFETY NET PROGRAM WHICH DOESN'T RECEIVE STATE FUNDING OUR PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE DEMAND. OUR POPULATIONS ARE GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. IN PART BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS. LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER THE LAST SIX TWENTY THIRTY YEARS SINCE REALIGNMENT- OUR CASELOADS HAVE ABOUT 50% OF THE STUFF THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE NEED CURRENTLY. AND SO WE SUBMIT RESPECTFULLY THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS. OR I SHOULD SAY. IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE FACING. OUR MEMBERS ARE SO SHORT STAFFED. THAT WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE CARE THAT OUR CLIENTS DESERVE. TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY DESERVE IT. AN EVER GROWING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS EXISTING EXITING THE JAILS. THE PRISONS AND ACUTE HOSPITALS. HAS INTENSIFIED AND WE ARE GETTING THOSE REFERRALS BECAUSE OF THE- DIVERSION FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOT TOO LITTLE I'M SORRY. FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING TO CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT HAS BECOME THE NORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. JUSTICE REFORM HAS REALLY RESULTED IN AND OUT CONSERVATORSHIP AS THE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION. AND THAT IS NOT. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WRONG THING THAT'S JUST THE REALITY AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO DESERVE TREATMENT AND OFTENTIMES NEED CONSERVATORSHIP THE PROBLEM IS. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY STUFF IN A GIVEN OFFICE AND WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ABSORB THOSE INDIVIDUALS ANY LONGER. IN ADDITION THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR STATE IS ALSO IMPACTING OUR MEMBERS. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH A CRIME. AND THEY HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR OWN DEFENSE SO AS A RESULT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO FOR TREATMENT TO BE RESTORED OFTENTIMES THEY'RE NOT RESTORED AND SO THEY COME TO CONSERVATORSHIP AS A RESULT. THREE THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY WHICH IS GOING TO DOUBLE THAT NUMBER THAT WE'RE GETTING NOW. BECAUSE OF THE MISDEMEANOR INCOMPETENCE STAND TRIAL CASES WILL ALL BE COMING OUR WAY NOT ALL OF THEM THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. BUT WE WILL BE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THOSE CASES BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER WILL BE GOING FOR COMPETENCY TRAINING. THEY WILL BE COMING MOSTLY THE CONSERVATORSHIP. THE HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE LPS ACT. AND MANY CASE LAW PRECEDENTS HAVE NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF GREAT DISABILITY. IT HAS ALSO LED TO THE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS ARE THE ANSWER TO THE SOCIETAL PROBLEMS THAT FORCED WERE CHALLENGED WITH AT THE MOMENT. MOSTLY THE HOMELESS AND UNSHELTERED THERE IS A BELIEF IN SOME SOME AREAS THAT CONSERVATORSHIP CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM I'M HERE TO TELL YOU CAN NOT. WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY NOR DO A LOT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEED THAT LEVEL OF CARE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING. THERE IS A LOT OF THERE'S AN INCREASE IN LOOKING TO CONSERVATORSHIP TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY PARTNERSHIP WITH A STATE AGENCY. WITHOUT A STATE PARTNERSHIP WE CAN'T MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OR COLLECT THE DATA. THAT WE NEED TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. AND CERTAINLY CAN'T DEVELOP THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GUIDE FUTURE POLICY DECISION MAKING. OUR PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS. ARE ALSO TAX WITH THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO PLACEMENTS YOU'VE HEARD THAT EARLIER SO I WILL BLAKE- GO OVER THAT AGAIN. AND WE ALSO HAVE A SEVERE LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO HELP WITH THE- INDIGENT POPULATION WHICH IS THE BUT MOST OF WHAT OUR MEMBER SERVICE. AND WITH THAT MY TIME IS OVER AND I'M READY FOR ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU TO MOVE HER LAST SPEAKER OF THIS PANEL TIFFANY LEÓN SENATE. YES. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HONOR OF BEING HERE TODAY I AM A PUBLIC DEFENDER I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR TWENTY YEARS NEXT SPECIALIZING CONSERVATORSHIP FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICES HAVE A UNIQUE LENS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ONLY SEEING INDIVIDUALS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH MENTAL HEALTH BUT WE ALSO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS AT THE PSYCHIATRIC HOLD AND WHEN THEY LATER GO ON TO. RID OF HABEAS CORPUS FOR THOSE APPEALS OF THOSE PSYCHIATRIC HOLES AND THEN LATER ON IN LPS CONSERVATORSHIP AND START WITH SOME DATA OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS- OUR PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE CREATED A PRE TRIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM WHERE WE GO WHEN WE INTERVIEW PEOPLE IN CUSTODY PRIOR TO ARRAIGNMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WE DO EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS TO ASSESS. ONE OF THOSE TOOLS IS THE BRIEF MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL I CAN TELL YOU IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS WE SAW ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUALS. OF THOSE UP SUPPORT 48% NEEDED HOUSING. AND FORTY FOUR HAD A SUBSTANCE USE. DISORDER THAT NEEDED TREATMENT. SO OUR JOB IS THEN TO SAY WHERE WE PUT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE THEY GOING TO GO TO THE CRIME REPORT ARE THEY GOING TO GO TO DIVERSION. OR DO THEY GO THROUGH A CONSERVATORSHIP TRACK. WE LETTER IN THE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES WE HAVE EIGHT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY COMES IN ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD HAVE A RIGHT TO CERTIFICATION HEARING WITH PATIENTS RIGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL THAT HEARING. THEY CAN BE HELD IN A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY ON HOLD FOR FORTY SEVEN DAYS BEFORE BEING PUT ON A TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING WELL IN THREE MONTHS AT EIGHT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. THERE IS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE HOLES. OF THOSE SCHOOLS. ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY AND IT UP AND HEARINGS. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE TOOK THREE HUNDRED APPEALS OFF OF THOSE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HEARINGS. AND WHAT WE TRACK IS HOW MANY ARE FROM OUR COUNTY AND HOW MANY ARE FROM OTHER COUNTIES. BECAUSE SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LOT OF ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY WE GET A LOT OF COUNTIES BRINGING THEIR CLIENTS TO OUR COUNTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. SO OF THOSE NINETEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AND LPS CONSERVATORSHIP THAT'S DOWN FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN WE HAD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED. SO LET ME TELL YOU JUST THROUGH MY LENS WHERE I SEE THE FIVE OBSTACLES THAT WERE REALLY FACING NUMBER ONE LACK OF PLACEMENT IN HOUSING WE'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CONSERVATIVES ARE USUALLY PLACED IN BOARDING CARE LOT PLACEMENT OR THROUGH THE STATE HOSPITALS THOSE ARE USUALLY YOUR THREE AVENUES. BOARDING CARE THERE IS A LICENSING ISSUE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. ROMAN BOARDS DON'T REQUIRE A STATE LICENSE. SO GUESS WHAT HAPPENING THOSE BOARDING CARES ARE SHUTTING DOWN AND BEING CALLED ROMAN BOARDS IT'S A WHOLE LOT EASIER THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE. RIGHT AND THEY CAN CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT. AND THERE'S NOBODY AUDITING OF THERE'S NO ONE COMING IN SO WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN ALL THESE REMEMBER IT'S POPPING UP EVERYWHERE BUT WE CAN'T PLACE PEOPLE IN CONSERVATIVE AND REMEMBER THAT'S NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE. THE OTHER THING WE'RE SEEING. IS THE STATE SET DOWN OR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS CENTER. AND WHERE DID THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO THEY WENT TO BOARDING CARES AND GUESS WHAT BOARDING HERE'S GOT MORE MONEY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY ISSUE THEN WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. SO WHAT YOU HAD IN YOUR BOARDING CARDS ACROSS THE STATE BECOME DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS BOARDING CARES WHERE THOSE PARTY CARES MADE MORE MONEY LEAVING THE MENTAL HEALTH FORTY CARES CHECKED OUT. I'M LOCKED PLACEMENTS WE HAVE LONG WAIT LISTS TO GET INTO A QUEUE FACILITIES- DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS WE HAVE THAT WAIT LIST RIGHT NOW- ALL THIS IMPACTS THE ENTIRE SYSTEMS. I TALKED TO UC DAVIS AND THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS THEY HAD FOURTEEN PATIENTS PENDING CONSERVATORSHIP POLLS. THOSE FOURTEEN PATIENTS MADE UP FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINE DAYS MONEY. WELL AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THAT'S TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE FOURTEEN PATIENTS SITTING IN A UC DAVIS. HOSPITAL WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE- I HAVE PATIENTS I HAVE CLIENTS IN JAIL WAITING TWO YEARS FOR LPS PLACEMENT WE HAVE AN ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY BUT AS FIFTY BEDS BUT FORTY SEVEN OF THEM ARE LPS CONSERVATORSHIP THEY CAN'T MOVE INTO BETTER PLACEMENT. THAT'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE I'M REAL QUICK BECAUSE I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BACK OF CORONATION WITH THE SYSTEM WE'RE TRYING TO COORDINATE PRIVATE SECTORS HOSPITALS JAILS MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. WE HAVE LACK OF COORDINATION WITH STATES WE RIGHT NOW HAVE- STATES AND COUNTIES NOT HAVING RESOURCES SO THEY DUMPED INTO OTHER COUNTIES. AND THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS FINDING WE HAVE A GREAT STATE FUNDING THEY'RE NOT. ALLOCATING MONEY JUST FOR LPS THERE ONE TIME FUNDING. I'M IN THERE NOT CARVED OUT. THIS RECYCLED THIS CAUSES RECYCLES OF HOLES THIS CAUSES PROBLEMS IN PLACEMENTS- WE HAVE BLOODY DISCHARGE HAPPENING WE HAVE INCREASED IN THIRTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ISSUES HAPPENING WE'RE NOT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FRIENDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU INTERESTING PANEL AND MEMBERS ARE ALSO NOTED THAT THIS PANEL WILL BE BACK IN THE AFTERNOON TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND TEN BEST PRACTICES OF THIS IS LAYING THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US OR THEIR QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL AT THIS POINT. I WOULD JUST HAVE ONE QUICK ONE QUESTION AND I WANT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORKING FOR YOUR PASSION AND FOR. TAKING THE TIME OUT TO COME TODAY INTENT AND HELP US UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE MORE OF THESE PROBLEMS. BUT JUST BROUGH AND I'M SURE THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE HERE SOMEWHERE BUT THAT THE HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PUBLIC GUARDIANSHIP I MEAN IT WASN'T. THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON UNDER CONTROL WORKING SERVED WHO HAVE A PRIVATE GUARDIAN OR PUBLIC GUARDIAN DO WE KNOW THAT NUMBER. NOBODY KNOWS THAT NUMBER I CAN TELL YOU ROUGHLY WHAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER JUST BECAUSE WE REPRESENT ALL OKAY- WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND PUBLICLY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT PRIVATE. OKAY AND OKAY AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT STATEWIDE BUT WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T. RIGHT WE COULD STRUGGLING WITH POTENTIALLY OKAY IT'S REALLY HARD FOR FAMILIES TO TAKE A YES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT. WHEN IT WHEN IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF THE TIME JUSTICE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I AND I AM IN THE HIVE NAME SWITCH THE BOARDING CARE TO THE TO THE CARE MORE TO THAT'S THAT'S CRAFTY. DESCRIBED BUT AND CERTAINLY THE IDEA DE POPULATION I MEAN THEY'RE NOT MAKING MILLIONS EITHER RIGHT EVERY SO THAT FOR IT RIGHT BUT IT TELLS US. IT HELPS US I THINK- UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM THAT THE EVEN DEEPER LEVEL ABOUT HOW. HOW WE THINK WE CREATE A SYSTEM IN THOSE WORK AROUNDS. THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU OTHER FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT'S RIGHT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU ON THE STATISTICS- SHOWING US HOW MANY HELP THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THAT THE THOUSANDS OF JUDAH INTERVIEWED- THE HOUSING WORKS HOUSING IS THE ISSUE OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE KNOWING THAT THAT INFORMATION ALSO IS VERY HELPFUL AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS AFTERNOON WHEN YOU PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THAT THANK YOU WE OFTEN TIMES FORGET TO LOOK AT NEEDS AND I'M TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THAT SILO. WE'RE TRYING TO FIT PEOPLE AS JUST MENTALLY ILL AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE VERY COMPLEX WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ALL HAVING THE CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE. OKAY ON THE QUESTION RIGHT THANK YOU PANEL SEE YOU BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR SERVICE DESK TODAY THIS MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH I GUESS WE ARE OFTEN TECHNICIANS RIGHT NOW WILL MOVE ON TO THAT ADVOCATES THEN AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING. EACH OF THESE PANELS THIS MORNING TO THE DELAY OF THE PROBLEM IN IN THE AFTERNOON TO LAY OUT SOME SOLUTIONS AND WITH US WE HAVE MOST OR IN PERSON KAREN SAVAGE. THREE SEPARATE SCREENING JENNIFER FREED BY. ANY CHANCE MORE EATEN FOR IS WITH US REMOTELY. SO SORRY WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO STAGE. BASED A LITTLE BIT YEAH BUT ALSO PROVIDE FOR. BUT PEOPLE TO COME TO THE PANEL. SO THANK YOU SO. PLEASE GO AHEAD GREAT- SO- GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING ADD SHARES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KAREN SAVAGE THAT ONE AND THAT DECADE RECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK OR C. PEN WE'RE STATEWIDE MULTI CULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND I FIRST REALLY WHEN I THINK KERRISON CLUTCH YOU SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES EARLIER FOR ABOUT THEIR BRAVERY AND THEIR GENEROSITY. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT EMOTIONAL TOPIC FOR MANY OF US WHO ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I ALSO WENT WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS RACIAL DISPARITIES AND RACIAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS CONVERSATION AND I PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS IN THREE AREAS WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. SO FIRST WHAT WE KNOW. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A LONG HISTORY. OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE IN MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. AND TREATMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT THIS IS A THING OF THE PAST. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EVEN PRESENTLY BLACK AMERICANS ARE OVER DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND UNDER DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION. EVEN WHEN COMPARING SIMILAR SYMPTOMATIC PRESENTATIONS IN BLACK AND WHITE PATIENTS. AS A RESULT THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. ISSUED A STATEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR APOLOGIZING. TO BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. FOR THE ROLE OF PSYCHIATRY IN PERPETUATING RACISM IN THE PAST AND TODAY. PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN EXPERIENCE A TRAJECTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT PUTS THEM IN A POSITION OF BEING SUBJECT TO ITS COERCIVE TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS. THIS TAKES THE FORM OF BOTH INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH COMMITMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS BASED ON A LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED AFFORDABLE AND COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS. AS WELL AS WELL AS THE PERVASIVE IMPLICIT BIAS THAT LEADS TO THE STIGMATIZING BELIEF THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS ARE DANGEROUS. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS AND MOST LIKELY TO REPORT AN UNMET NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OF THOSE WHO DO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DOOR AND WHO DO ACCESS SERVICES. PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN EXPERIENCE LOWER QUALITY OR LESS EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. WHAT COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SEEN IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT. WHICH IS OFTEN A GATEWAY TO SHORT AND LONG TERM INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS. AS A RESULT PEOPLE OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT- SETTINGS KENDRA'S LAW FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. SHOW THAT PER TWENTY YEAR PERIOD 35% OF THOSE WITH AN INVOLUNTARY OUTPATIENT COMMITMENT ORDER WERE BLACK COMPARED TO JUST 17% OF THE STATE POPULATION. DATA UNDERSERVED BY CALIFORNIA SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM SHOWS THAT BLACK CLIENTS ARE NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION AS WHITE CLIENTS. MOREOVER BLACK KAIET SOMETIMES HAVE LONGER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE FOLLOW UP WITH DISCHARGED. THEN THERE'S WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND THE GAPS IN DATA HAVE BEEN ROBUSTLY DISCUSSED TODAY. BUT I WILL ADD TO THAT THAT WE DON'T KEEP STATEWIDE AND- FULL DATA ON THEIR RACE OR ETHNICITY OF THOSE SUBJECTS LPS HOLDEN CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DATA THAT COUNTIES REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND AS A RESULT WE'RE UNABLE AT THE STATE AND YOU ARE UNABLE TO ASSESS PATTERNS OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION THAT MAY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. IF THE DANCING RACIAL EQUITY IS A GOAL OF REFORMING ANY PART OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE MUST CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. WE MUST HAVE A FULL PICTURE OF HOW PEOPLE ACCESS OR FAIL TO ACCESS ALL COMPONENTS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WITH SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND WE MUST UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS. SECOND WE MUST FIND AND BUILD A FULL CONTINUUM OF CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PERSON CENTERED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. I MUST ENGAGE IN RIGOROUS PURSUIT OF EVIDENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHICH SERVICES ARE EFFECTIVE OR NOT. THIRD WE MUST STOP LETTING MARGINALIZED CALIFORNIANS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BY ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAVE HAS ACCESS TO A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOME. AND FOURTH WE MUST HONESTLY AND INTENTIONALLY ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES. A SOCIETAL CRISES INCLUDING MASS INCARCERATION. AND UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY BRIEF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE BIRTH TO MY DAUGHTER AT KAISER HOSPITAL IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. THE BIRTH WAS UNEXPECTEDLY COMPLICATED AND THE NEXT MORNING. WELL IN THE RECOVERY UNIT I REALIZED THAT I WAS NOT OKAY. I WAS EXPERIENCING A RESPONSE TO A TRAUMA. THAT I HAD UNDERGONE AND I NEEDED HELP. MY AMAZING NURSES RECOGNIZE THAT I DID NEED SUPPORT AND THEY TAPPED EVERY RESOURCE THEY HAD TO TRY TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR ME. HOWEVER I WAS ULTIMATELY GIVEN TWO OPTIONS. I COULD GO HOME AND TRY TO FIND RESOURCES ON MY OWN. OR THE HOSPITAL COULD PLACE ME ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD SEPARATING ME FROM MY NEWBORN BABY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT ANY NEW MOM ASKING FOR HELP SHOULD BE GIVEN. I HOPE THAT AS THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES YOU WILL ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT USE THE LPS ACT TO PLUG THE SUBSTANTIAL GAPS IN OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. INSTEAD WE CAN ACT WITH EQUITY AND INCLUSION AS OUR CORE VALUES. AND SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRESS THREE SERVICE CLAIMS. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIR CHAIR STONE- I I'M I'M GOING TO TRY TO REDUCE MY COMMENT SO I KNOW WE'RE OUT OF TIME HERE- I DO HOPE TODAY TO HEAR THE VOICES OF MANY FAMILIES LIKE MINE- I AND I'M GRATEFUL TO NAOMI CALIFORNIA FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS TERESA PASQUINI AND I AM A CALIFORNIA MOM ON A MISSION. TO SAVE MY SON'S LIFE AND POSSIBLY OUR STATE AND NATIONAL SOUL I AM A LOCAL STATE NATIONAL ADVOCATE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE HE WROTE KLAY WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH ARE BRAINLESS IS NOT BEHAVIORAL CHOICES. MY BELOVED SON DANNY HAD HIS FIRST FIFTY ONE FIFTY AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND A SUICIDE BY COP TYPE OF IT. WITH THE HELP OF THE PEDIATRICIAN AND CLINICIAN HE WAS DIAGNOSED EARLY RECEIVED INTENSIVE THERAPIES HAD A JOB AND GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WE THOUGHT WE HAD MANAGED HIS CARE. BUT ON HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY HE WAS FIFTY ONE FIFTY FOR THE SECOND TIME AND FELL INTO WHAT I CALL THE BLACK HOLE OF THE CALIFORNIA DON'T MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HE WAS PLACED ON AN LPS CONSERVATORSHIP AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN DURING HIS THIRD INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION THAT YEAR. WE RECEIVED LPS CONSERVATORSHIP PAPERS FROM THE CONTRAPOSITIVE COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE. I CALLED THE OFFICE TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS MEANT AND THE PUBLIC CONSERVATIVE SAID TO ME. WHY DO YOU KEEP BRINGING HIM HOME HE IS VERY SICK. AT THE SAME TIME HIS INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST TOLD US THAT WE WOULD BE LUCKY. IF WE COULD GET OUR SON INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HE SAID IT CASUALLY AS THOUGH WE WERE BEING. AS THOUGH HE WERE BEING ACCEPTED TO CAL OR STANFORD. I WAS INFURIATED I REALIZED THAT HE WAS GIVING US FAIR WARNING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS WHERE WE HOUSE PEOPLE. WITH SMI IN CALIFORNIA. AS MY FRIEND AND FELLOW NOMINEE MEMBER MARC GAIL SAYS THIS IS BECAUSE QUOTE JAIL IS THE BAD THAT NEVER SAY NO. I LEARNED THEN THAT THE SYSTEM REQUIRED ME TO MAKE MY SON HOMELESS AND GRAVELY DISABLED IN ORDER TO GET HIM THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT. I LEARNED EVERY NUANCE OF EVERY STATUTES POLICY AND REGULATION I BECAME AN EXPERT ON NAVIGATING A BROKEN SYSTEM THAT DEMANDS IT DANGEROUS NOUS COMPLETE DETERIORATION BEFORE ONE CAN ACCESS THE LEVEL OF CARE. THAT MY SON NEEDED BUT I ASKED EVERYONE HERE TODAY ISN'T IT TIME THAT WE ALL UNBREAK THE SYSTEM TOGETHER. DURING THE TWENTY YEARS OF MY SON'S CONSERVATORSHIP HE WAS FIFTY ONE FIFTY OVER FORTY TIMES. PLACED IN MULTIPLE LOCKED FACILITIES IN NINE COUNTIES ARRESTED AS A PATIENT AND PUT IN SOLITARY WELL UNDER AND I. S. T. HOLD. SHUFFLE BETWEEN TWO STATE HOSPITALS AND WAS MIRACULOUSLY STAYED FROM PRISON WHEN DIVERTED TO AN I. N. D. IN MERCED COUNTY WHERE HE WAS STABILIZED PROPERLY TREATED AND HAD ALL CRIMINAL CHARGES DROPPED. RECEIVING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE IN A LOCKED I AM DEEP ALLOWED HIM TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO SYNERGIES NO WAVE OF VISTA CAMPUS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. FINALLY HE WAS IN THE NINE O'CLOCK HOUSING THAT HEELS FACILITY HE HAS BEEN LIVING STABLY SAFELY AND SOBER IN THE COMMUNITY FOR OVER TWO YEARS HIS TWENTY YEAR LPS CONSERVATORSHIP WAS RENEWED THIS MONTH AND I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT HE NOW HAS THE CAPACITY. TO KNOW HE NEEDS IT. THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING CIVIL OR RIGHT ABOUT MY SON'S CARE IN CALIFORNIA. WE MUST STOP SAYING THAT WE ARE PROGRESSIVE PROTECTORS OF HUMAN CIVIL AND DISABILITY RIGHTS WHILE WE ARE FORCING THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. INTO EARLY GRAVES SOLITARY JAIL CELLS ARE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM OF CHOICE. THERE IS NO CHOICE NO DIGNITY NO FREEDOM UNDER THE CURRENT LPS SYSTEM. SELF DETERMINATION WITHOUT REGARD TO HOW HIGH A PRICE MUST BE PAID FOR THAT PRIVILEGE IS TOO HIGH A PRICE EMPLACEMENT IN JAILS PRISONS STATE HOSPITALS ARE HOMELESSNESS AND VICTIMIZATION. ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF FREEDOM. TELL ME HOW CAN ONE PARTICIPATE IN INFORMED CONSENT IF ONE SUFFERS FROM MANTA SAID NOKIA THE LACK OF INSIGHT THAT ONE IS STILL. THE LPS LAW DOES NOT WORK THE DEFINITION OF GREAT DISABILITY IS VAGUE AND NARROW AND IT IS JUST LUCK AND AEROBICS THAT OUR SON IS STILL ALIVE. MY SON'S LIFE IS NOT A GAME OF RISK. POLICY MAKING MUST BECOME HUMANITY BASED REALITY BASED DATA BASED ON EQUITY BASE WITH A LASER FOCUS ON THE FORGOTTEN SMI POPULATION. THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION IN OUR STATE IS SHAMEFUL AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. IN TWENTY TWENTY I CO WROTE A PAPER WITH LORNA TELANGANA CALLED HOUSING THAT HEALS AND IN THAT PAPER WE DETAIL OUR LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S BROKEN SYSTEM OF CARE. IT DESCRIBES HOW MY SON AND FAMILY EXPERIENCE EVERY JAGGED EDGE OF EVERY BROKEN PIECE THAT THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. AND IN SPITE OF ALL OF OUR EFFORTS AND RESOURCES MY SON ENDED UP IN NAPA STATE HOSPITAL ON THE CIVIL NOT A CRIMINAL COMMITMENT AND WAS THEN ARRESTED AS A PATIENT AND PLACED IN THE I. S. T. HUMAN LOG JAM. THAT EXPERIENCE ALMOST BROKE MY SON AND OUR FAMILY BUT WE SURVIVED TO TELL OUR STORY AND I REFUSED TO LEAVE THAT DAY OUT OF THE SOUL OUT OF ANY HELP OR JUSTICE REFORM CONVERSATION. NO FAMILY MEMBER WANTS TO COMPEL THEIR LOVED ONE TO RECIEVE TREATMENT OVER OBJECTION. UNLESS THEY LACK THE CAPACITY OF MAKING A VOLUNTARY DECISION TO SEEK TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN. IT IS A GUT WRENCHING DECISION THAT TEARS UP THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE FAMILY. WE HEAR ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE LARGER DISABLED COMMUNITY BUT THERE IS SILENCE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE US OF MY POPULATION WHO ARE GRAVELY DISABLED. FAMILIES LIKE MINE ARE SHATTERING THE SILENCE AND WE ARE ASKING THAT OUR LOVED ONES HAVE ACCESS TO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO BECOME A GRAVELY DISABLED. HELP US. HELP THEM LEARN LOVE WORK LIVE FREE. FROM FREEDOM FROM CODIFIED FISCAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE LEGAL TORTURE OF LPS. THIS IS NOT A CIVIL LIBERTIES BATTLE AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO USE JAILS OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND SPEND MILLIONS ON JAIL FACE LIVES TO MAKE SUFFERING LOOK BETTER THIS IS NOT A BATTLE OF CHOICE WHEN THERE IS NO CHOICE FOR FAMILIES EXCEPT TO WAIT FOR DANGER OR REFUSED TO HOUSE OUR LOVED ONES IN ORDER TO GET THEM HELP. BEFORE HARM YOU ASK HOW CAN HELP YES BE IMPROVED. PLEASE STOP FORCING OUR LOVED ONES TO DETERIORATE TO A LEVEL OF DANGEROUSNESS AND AN INABILITY TO SURVIVE SAFELY IN OUR COMMUNITIES BEFORE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE HELP THEY NEED. TREATMENT IS NOT A BAD WORD. MY SON NEED TO TREAT THAT PERSON NOT HOUSING FIRST HE HAD A HOME. HE ALSO HAD A BRAIN DISORDER THOUGHT DISORDERS BUT STILL IT'S CAPACITY TO THINK CLEARLY ABOUT HIS CHOICES AND SELF DETERMINATION. HIS NOBLE BRAIN ILLNESS REQUIRED THE LPS LAWS TO PROTECT HIM NOT TO MAKE HIM FEEL OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THERE IS NO DIGNITY IN CONTINUOUS FAILURE. WE MUST MOVE ON LOCK. ENTEROTOXIN CALIFORNIA IF WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE A WHOLE PERSON CARE THEN WE NEED A WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND THAT IS WHAT THE HOUSING THAT HILLS VISION ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES TO STATE HOSPITALS JAILS PRISONS HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE. WE MUST ALL LAY DOWN OUR IDEOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND UNITE OUR HUMANITY IN SUPPORT OF LOS AT WORK IN THE REAL WORLD TO FACILITATE TREATMENT SO PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO TREATMENT BEFORE TRAGEDY AND CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY. I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN I KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN TWENTY YEARS OF BEING SHUNNED SHAMED FAILED IN JAIL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M SORRY PLEASE WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OUT. THOSE WHO CONSIDERED OUTBURST IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT SOMEONE YOU CAN DO IT SILENTLY THAT IS APPRECIATED. WELL NOW MOVE ON TO JENNIFER FREED BACK WHO'S WITH US REMOTELY. I THANK YOU STILL SORRY THERESA- TO LONG I. THE WAY OF INTRODUCING MYSELF I'M JENNIFER FREEDOM BOUGHT A DIRECTOR OF THE COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS IN SAN FRANCISCO- WE ORGANIZE ON HEALTH FOLKS TO CREATE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED ON AND OFF WORKING TO TRANSFORM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE PAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. GATHERING INPUT DIRECTLY FROM FOLKS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HAVE MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES AND THEN AMPLE FIND THE COMMON EXPERIENCES OF SYSTEM FAILURES AND CHANGES NEEDED. WELL SAN FRANCISCO IS SEEN AS HAVING A ROBUST- MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IT IS IN FACT NOWHERE NEAR MEETING THE NEED. IN TRUTH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS A MESS- DUE TO SEVERE FUNDING CUTS OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS- RESULTING IN A BYZANTINE ACCESS SYSTEM THAT SERVES TO DISQUALIFY PEOPLE RATHER THAN ENGAGE THEM IN. SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE QUICK CARE FOR FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY ARE SYSTEM IN SAN FRANCISCO IS OVERLY RELIANT ON THE HIGH END OF CARE. MANY FOLKS OKAY KAREN TELL THEIR CRISES AND BROUGHT IT ON TO YOUR COLD. THIS EXPERIENCE LAYERS ADDITIONAL TRAUMA MAKING RECOVERY MORE DIFFICULT. SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE HIGHEST RATE BY FAR OF PERMANENT CONSERVATORSHIP IN THE STATE AND LAST YEAR ABOUT NINE THOUSAND TIMES AN INDIVIDUAL WAS FIFTY ONE FIFTY DID SAN FRANCISCO ALONE. IN A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST REPORTS ON A TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN OF FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS WERE BROUGHT INTO SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PSYCH EMERGENCY FOR A FIFTY ONE FIFTY. B. TWENTY NINE LANDED IN A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM WHILE ALMOST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED- WE'RE JUST CHARGE OF THE STREET WITH NOT EVEN A. REFERRAL TO ANY TYPE OF HELP AT ALL. I FOR THOSE WHO WERE HELD AS- TO BEAT THE CRITERIA. ARE WEIGHTLESS FOR APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT LET. A CUTE STAYS BEYOND WHAT WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY OR IN SOME CASES LONG WAITS IN JAIL UNTIL APPROPRIATE THAT'S RUBBISH ALL FOR THOSE WHO GOT INTO THE COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT UPON COMPLETION WE FOUND ONLY 9% LIMITED IN STABLE HOUSING. PSYCHIATRY HAS A DEEPLY RACIST LEGACY FROM THE CREATION OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS TO EXPLAIN SLAVE TENDENCIES TO RUN AWAY AND AVOID HARD WORK IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. TO THE JUSTIFICATION OF DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION CLAIMING BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES NO WE'RE RACES PRACTICES MORE HARMFUL THAN IN LOCKED FACILITIES LOOKING AT THESE ISSUE TODAY TAKEN SEPARATE CISCO AS AN EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT WHO GETS FIFTY ONE FIFTY. A SYSTEM THAT IS MOSTLY LAW ENFORCEMENT LED YOU SEE IT'S AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET PUT INTO A LOCKED FACILITIES. SAN FRANCISCO OF THE ONE THOUSAND FORTY EIGHT UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS FROM THAT- DATABASE WERE BROUGHT INTO SAN FRANCISCO SECOND. AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER REPRESENTED BY SIX FULL MAKING UP 31% OF THE INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO OVERALL THE FLOCCULATION SF AT 5% OKAY DEEPER INTO WHO IT'S BROUGHT IN ON FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND HOW THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THEM. AND YES WHEN WE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES SOMEONE MOST OFTEN THAT'S DUE TO A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FAILURE. THAT SAME DATABASE SHOWS THAT ONLY 13% OF ALL INDIVIDUALS HAD AN ASSIGNED. INTENSIVE CASE MANAGER 13% FOR EVERY ONE PERSON WITH A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS YOU QUALIFIES HIM ON TO RECEIVE A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP- OR INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT TO PEOPLE ARE UNABLE AND SAN FRANCISCO TO GET IT BECAUSE THE SLOTS ARE FIT. ARE FULL SAN FRANCISCO'S LOST OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS IMPORTING CARE FACILITIES OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES WE HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS YOU NEED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND ARE NOT GETTING IT FOR UNDER PASADENA LITERALLY EVERY LEVEL OF CARE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT COMMITTEE CRISIS PART OF HOUSING. IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU TYPICALLY HAVE TO BE HOMELESS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE YOU CAN GET SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT FOLKS WANT HERE IT'S NOT THE SYSTEM REALLY HAS THE FORM OF CARE THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT FOR EVERYONE OF THE HORROR STORIES YOU'RE HERE TODAY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK OUT ON THE STREETS A GREAT HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. THOSE ARE FOLKS WHO ALREADY QUALIFY FOR CONSERVATORSHIP THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CONSERVING CALIFORNIA YES IS FALLEN- BUT IT'S NOT THAT THE CONSERVATORSHIP STANDARD IS TOO STRICT FOR THE JUDGES ARE APPLYING THE STANDARD TO NEARLY. RATHER CONSERVATORSHIP FACES THE SAME PROBLEM AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR SYSTEM INSUFFICIENT FUNDS AND CAPACITY. IF THEY DON'T GET CONCERNED IT'S A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM OF CARE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ROUTED INTO A VERY FALSE CHOICE THE CHOICE BETWEEN KEEPING PEOPLE ON THE STREETS THE COMPENSATOR DIE. OR EXPERIENCE YES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FOR STREET BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OCEAN. OF AFFECTED POLICY AND SYSTEM CHOICES BETWEEN THOSE TWO. IT SOME WE DON'T GIVE PEOPLE THE CARE THEY NEED. WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE IN CRISIS TO GET CARE ALL THEM AND SPENT ABOUT LIKELY MOST LIKELY WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE. MOST PEOPLE'S FIRST INTERACTION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS IN HANDCUFFS IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXPANSIONS OF CONSERVATORSHIP THE EVIDENCE THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT THE FORCING OF TREATMENT BUT THE AVAILABILITY. OF TREATMENT THAT MEETS THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS. THAT WAS NEVER AVAILABLE BEFORE. FOR ME THIS IS NOT AN- AND- IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT IS THEMOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK. ON HOUSE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES CAN TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE. THEY WILL TELL YOU FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THAT OCCASIONALLY THEY NEED TO BE LOCKED UP. BUT MORE OFTEN AND WHAT IS THE VERY COMMON THING. IS THAT THEY NEED TO STOP BEING LOCKED OUT. I AM GOING TO END UP. AND THIS WITH THE CLOSING OF A QUESTION. WHY IS THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON EXPANDING THE MOST DISCRIMINATORY LEAST AFFECTED MOST RESTRICTIVE AND MOST COSTLY ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM. IS THE STATE LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN SOLVING THE ISSUE. AND IF SO. YOU SERIOUSLY MISDIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND OUR FINAL SPEAKER CHEN FLOORING. HE WAS ALSO WITH US REMOTELY. GOOD MORNING I'M JENNIFER LORI WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY CALIFORNIA'S OLDEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER SHE OFTEN WHEN ISSUED CONSERVATORSHIP COME UP IN THIS BUILDING WHAT'S REALLY ON PEOPLE'S MIND IF PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS SHOWING SIGNS OF SEVERE DISTRESS WHETHER PROCESSES USED ACROSS SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR A COMBINATION ACT MOVED TO FOCUS FROM WHERE IT SHOULD BE. DESPITE THE RECENT STATE BUDGET WINDFALL AN INCREASE IN STATE SPENDING WE STILL DO NOT HAVE THE SERVICES NECESSARY TO IMMEDIATELY HELP SOMEONE IN CRISIS OR BETTER YET BEFORE THEY'RE IN CRISIS WITH VOLUNTARY INTENSIVE AND THERAPEUTIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FURTHERMORE WE LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THE COST OF HOUSING IS SKYROCKETED IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT LOS ANGELES AN AREA THAT SEE MORE OF ITS FAIR SHARE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHOUT HOUSING THE AVERAGE APARTMENT RENT INCREASED BY 65% IN THE LAST DECADE. YOU HOUSEHOLDS COULD WHETHER 65% INCREASE IN RENT MUCH LESS INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. THE ANSWER TO THIS CRISIS IS NOT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO CONSERVE PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS TO ADDRESS THE COST OF HOUSING AND PROVIDE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT PEOPLE STRUGGLING NEAT. FAILING TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS MEANS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL UNDERGO THE TRAUMA OF HAVING NO HOMES AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WILL NEED INTENSIVE SERVICES AS A RESULT. THIS POSITIONAL STRESS ON A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT ALREADY DOES NOT SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WESTERN CENTER AS LONG ADVOCATED FOR THE. LONG ADVOCATED FOR INCREASED SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS FOR INCREASED HOUSING SUPPORT TIME AND TIME AGAIN VOTERS IN THE STATE HAVE AUTHORIZED INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE HOUSING ONLY TO SEE OTHER SERVICES REAL BACK OR DELAYED IN BUILDING AND OTHER DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT WE NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY BRAND NEW SOLUTIONS BUT FOR THOSE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE VOTERS INTENT. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PROP SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WITH PASSED IT WAS BUILT ON THE CHASSIS OF AB THIRTY FOUR IN AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR PROGRAMS PROGRAMS THAT HAD DOCUMENTED THEIR SUCCESS IN PREVENTING JAIL TIME AND HOSPITAL TIME FOR PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS LIVING ON THE STREET. BOB SIXTY THREE EVEN CONTAIN SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT LANGUAGE SAID THAT EARLIER FUNDS WERE ELIMINATED AND COURTS FAILED TO UPHOLD THE CLEAR INTENT OF THE VOTERS WESTERN CENTER REPRESENTED PLAINTIFFS INVOLVED IN TRYING TO ENFORCE THIS PROVISION PLAINTIFFS THAT INCLUDED. PROVIDERS AND INDIVIDUALS. READ BENEFITTED THE EIGHTY FOUR AND EIGHTY THIRTY FOUR PROGRAMS. BUT MANY ALTERNATELY LOST ACCESS WHEN THOSE PROGRAMS WERE DEFUNDED. AND HAVING WORKED WITH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE I WILL JUST SAY THAT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE THE VERY INDIVIDUAL FUTURE DESCRIBES NOW PEOPLE WHO ARE HEARING VOICES IN THEIR HEAD. PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING TO THEMSELVES AND TO SEE WHAT A DIFFERENCE A VOLUNTARY BUT SLOWLY WHATEVER IT TAKES MODEL. CAN HAVE ON AN INDIVIDUAL IS TRULY TRANSFORMING PROGRAM HAS HAD PILOT PROGRAMS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH UTILIZED AS OF HEALTHCARE AND EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACCESS TO DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL SERVICES. THROUGH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT AND THE HEALTH HOME PILOT. HELICOPTER MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AVERAGES OVER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND EASILY EXCEEDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THOSE WHO ARE FREQUENT HOSPITAL USERS. INTERNET RECENT EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE PERSON CAR PILOT BY UCLA INSUFFICIENT HOUSING TO REFER PEOPLE TO WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER SIX TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. NOW THOSE PILOTS ARE ENDING AND SIMILAR SERVICES ARE TO BE PROVIDED BY MANAGED CARE PLAN THROUGH THE MEDICARE- CAL AIM INITIATIVE. BUT THESE SERVICES ARE AT THE OPTION OF THE PLANS AND ARE NOT COUPLED WITH ADDITIONAL HOUSING BUT IN COORDINATION WITH THE SAME SCARE HOUSING RESOURCES. EVEN WHEN WE COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WERE NOT ADDRESSING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. WE KNOW THAT HOUSING FIRST MODELS WORK PARTICULARLY WHEN COUPLED WITH ALL OF THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED TO STABILIZE OFTEN IN A WHATEVER IT TAKES MODEL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS CAN REQUIRE MANY HOURS AT THE START OF OUR REGION TRUST BUILDING TO IT ENSURE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IN NEED OF SERVICES. CAN FEEL. COMFORTABLE RECEIVING THEM. IN THE IN WHICH SOMEONE CAN BE CONSERVED WITHOUT CORRESPONDING NEEDED SERVICES DURING AND AFTER THE CONSERVATORSHIP IS DOOMED TO FAIL. CONSERVING INDIVIDUALS IN LOCKED FACILITIES WITHOUT APPROPRIATE TREATMENT IS JAIL. RELEASING PEOPLE FROM CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT ADEQUATE HOUSING AND CORRESPONDING SERVICES IS A RECIPE FOR RELAPSE. THE LPS ACT WAS BUILT ON A PROMISE THAT A CONSERVATORSHIP WITH A LAST RESORT. AND WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. OUR CONCERNS ABOUT EXPANDING THE USE OF CONSERVATORSHIP IS NOT WITH THE PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE AUTONOMY OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IT'S ALSO BASED IN THE REAL HARM THAT TAKING AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS AND RIGHTS AND FOURTEEN TREATMENT ON AND THAT. PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON HOW THEY'RE ALREADY SUBJECT TO INCREASE DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TARGETING OF UNFAIR LAWS INCREASING COUNTERS WITH THE POLICE CRIMINALIZATION OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH A SWEEPING OR RECEIVING FOOD. HAVING THEIR POSSESSIONS TAKEN FROM THEM INCLUDING THE VERY MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED AND HAVING THE VEHICLE THEY ARE LIVING IN AND POUND IT LEAVING THEM LESS STATE AND FURTHER FROM STABILITY. HOMELESSNESS ITSELF IS AN ONGOING TRAUMA LIVING WITH SUCH STRESSORS WOULD CHALLENGE THE MOST MENTALLY FIT AMONG US BUT IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER AND WHO ARE RECOVERING FROM OTHER TRAUMAS. HAVING SOMEONE OF THE RIGHT AND FOURTEEN TREAT IS YET ANOTHER TRAUMA THAT CAN MAKE STABILIZATION EVEN HARDER TO CHANGE DUE TO THE PERSON INCREASING DISTRUST OF THE SERVICES BEING OFFERED. ON THE OTHER HAND EVERY SERVICE PROVIDER THAT WE WORK WITH THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS OR ON HOW TO REPORT LONG DELAYS IN BEING ABLE TO GET PEOPLE THE SERVICES THEY NEED IF THEY'RE ABLE TO AT ALL. ALL TOO OFTEN PEOPLE WORKING IN THIS SPACE HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER SOMEONE IN A CRISIS. EVEN IF THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED AS PART OF THE LPS ACT WERE EXPANDED SO THAT MORE PEOPLE WORKING SEARCH WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THEY NEED TO STABILIZE OR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED WILL HAVE A PLACE TO STAY. CHANGING THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF GRADES- GRAVELY DISABLED TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS AKIN TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS BY CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS. SHOULD ANY CHANGES THE CONTEMPLATED FOR LPS WE SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING GUARANTEED OFFERS A VOLUNTARY SERVICES PRIOR TO CONSERVING SOMEONE GUARANTEED APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICE WHILE SOMEONE IS CONCERT AND A GUARANTEE OF APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THE CONSERVATORSHIP AND- IN CLOSING. WE APPRECIATE THE EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING REALLY DOES WANT TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING WE WENT IT'S WHEN PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS WITH NO ACCESS TO SERVICES. BEYOND THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WERE CALLED IN WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A DANGER OR THE SHORT TERM HOSPITALIZATION AND COMPANIES THE PSYCHIATRIC HOLD. HOWEVER RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON WHETHER THE ACTIVE ALLOWING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO BE CONSERVED WE ASSET SERVICES SUCH AS INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ASSERTIVE OUTREACH SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS BE EXPANDED. WE ASK THAT YOU LISTEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO GET ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO FIND SECURE HOUSING. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU. I DO MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. RIGHT THREAT. THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED MODE LIST ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY I THINK IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPENING IN OURFAMILIES AND YOUR SON IS VERY HAPPY VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU IS HIS ADVOCATE BECAUSE THAT ADVOCACY CLEARLY X. EXPANDS BEYOND JUST YOUR SON. YOUR YOUR- CAUSING A CHANGE EVEN WITH SO MANY OTHERS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL TURNED BACK TO THE THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE ONE MORE PANEL AND THEN WE WILL TAKE A SHORT LUNCH IT WON'T BE IT WON'T BE VERY LONG SO BUT- BUT WE WILL DO THAT WILL TAKE A SHORT BREAK SO. I'M MOVING ON TO- LOCAL OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS- PERO IT MAKE IT MAKE DATING THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND JOHN SHARON AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES- COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH SO. LEAVE THAT- HAVE FAIR IS HERE IN PERSONAND THEN- DR SHARON IS GOING TO JOIN US- YEAH. VIDEO SO YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS WELL AS A CO CHAIR STONE FOR THIS SAYS- AMAZING ENOUGH INFORMATION FILLED DAY. I'M FOR MAY DAY TAKING REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE REPRESENT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK AS EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES. AND I THINK EVERY SPEAKER HAS TOUCHED UPON THE SAME POINTS THAT I INTENDED TO MAKE UP TO KEEP IT SHORT- BETWEEN YOU IN LUNCH- I WANT TO SAY THAT. WE UNDERSTAND- BOTH ON A PERSONAL LEVEL OF MYSELF AND- THE ASSOCIATION ITSELF THE LPS CONSERVATORSHIP FOR ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT TOUCH EVERYBODY'S LIFE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR COLLEAGUE OR FRIEND WHO IS STRUGGLING IN LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH YOU MAY EXPERIENCE THAT ON THE STREETS. YOU MAY EXPERIENCE IT IN OTHER AREAS OF YOUR LIFE AND SO NO ONE IS UNTOUCHED BY THIS- HAVE USE HEARD TODAY. THE COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATORS TAKE CARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US- MANY OF THEM I WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY BECAUSE A CONSERVATORSHIP IS REALLY THE LAST RESORT- DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A FIERCE MAMA BEAR LIKE MISS PLUS GREANEY WHO I SO COMPELLING- THERE AT THE REALLY THE ONLY PERSON. THAT IS TASKED WITH THEIR CARE IS THE LOCAL PUBLIC GUARDIAN AND PUBLIC GUARDIANS DO THIS. WITHOUT ANY STATE SUPPORT IT'S A 100% COUNTY FUNDED ON THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN PIECE AS- MISMATCHED MISTER SHE THAT WITH ELLIE- MADE CLEAR THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER FUNDING STREAMS THAT OFFER SERVICES TO THE CONSERVATIVES MUCH NEEDED BUT THE WHAT BUT THE CASE MANAGEMENT THAT THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS DUE IS A 100% COUNTY FUNDED. MANY OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS ALSO COME INTO PLAY AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE I WON'T LIST THEM ALL BUT IT RANGES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS- HOUSING AUTHORITY ARE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE TEAMS AND OTHERS- BUT OUT OF ALL THOSE ENTITIES. ONLY PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO RECEIVE NO STATE SUPPORT. IT'S NOT A REAL LINE PROGRAM. IT RECEIVES NO OTHER FUNDING FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE FEDERAL STATE- AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHILE THESE PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE LARGE CASELOADS COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS. ARE THEY ALSO STRUGGLE WITH WHAT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED HERE TO ISSUES ACTUALLY EQUITY AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. ONLY NOT ONLY INTO THEIR OWN SYSTEM BUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE STATEWIDE EAGER FOR HELP I WOULD LIKE TO INSURE STEP DOWN CARE COORDINATION AND TRACK OUTCOMES FOR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TOGETHER SHARE DATA I WOULD LIKE TO COLLABORATE MORE TO BETTER SERVE CONSERVANCIES BUT THE LINCHPINS OF THE SYSTEM THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS. ARE AT THE BREAKING POINT. THUS THE SINGLE LARGEST CHALLENGER MARC PERSPECTIVE IS THE NEED FOR NEW STATE RESOURCES TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE TOGETHER. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED A LOCAL PROBLEM. CITIES AND COUNTIES GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. AFTER MANY YEARS OF ADVOCACY AND LOTS AND LOTS OF DISCUSSION- THE- BROWN ADMINISTRATION IN THE NOOSA MINISTRATION IN A HUGE WAY. HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO HELP LOCALITIES WITH THIS ISSUE- AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE BUT IT'S BEING MADE- IT'S BECAUSE THE STATE AND LOCALITIES ARE NOW ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. THAT'S REALLY IS WHAT IT IS AND SO I WANNA MAKE THAT ANALOGY FOR THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS IF WE CAN PARTNER- WE CAN- HAVE RESOURCES THAT WORK FOR US WE CAN INCREASE THE DATA PER TRANSPARENCY WE CAN INCREASE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND WE CAN BETTER TAKE CARE OF ALL CONSERVATIVES- I'M SURE THIS TEAM DOCTOR SHERIN WHO SPEAKS AFTER ME HAS A FEW MORE IMPORTANT WANTS TO ELIMINATE- BUT ALL OF THE- GAPS IN HURDLES WE'VE HEARD TODAY. I THINK RESOURCES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE STATE TO WORK ON THIS FURTHER. THANK YOU TO MOVE ON TO DOCTOR SHEERAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE WOULD AND THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M JOHN SURE NUMBER- THE DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CRIMINAL HOW THE MUSCLE STICK HIGH INTEREST AND I DO MY CLINICAL WORK ALTHOUGH NOT VERY OFTEN- IN THE STREETS IN SKID ROW IN HOLLYWOOD- TED HELP THE POPULATION THAT WERE- DISTRACTING ABOUT RIGHT NOW- AND I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE FIRST OFF THAT. THE POINTS ARE BEING MADE BY EVERYBODY ARE YOU ARE ENTIRELY VALID AND A LOT OF THIS DOES TRACE BACK TO. THE D. INSTITUTIONALIZATION MOVEMENT WHICH JFK TRIED TO LAUNCH AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD IS DONE PROPERLY ONE OF THEM WHICH IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN AS- IN TRIESTE ITALY BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. WELL IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAINLY NOT. IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BUILD UP OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCES MIGHT BE TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES BUT I MEAN ALSO SHOT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. AND OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE MORE OF A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED. WHEN THEY NEED THEM WHERE THEY NEED AND HOW THEY YOU KNOW FROM WHOM THEY NEED THAT WHICH OCCURS MYRICK PRODUCT I BELIEVE IN A REALLY LOVELY WAY. AND THAT THOSE SERVICES NEED TO BE DIGNIFIED AND WELCOMING. I WITH THAT BEING THE CASE IN L. A. COUNTY AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF L. A. COUNTY NOT ALL COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. I'M IN ROCKY HILL DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF REPRESENTING CVH YET. WE CLEARLY HAVE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND I'M NOT SAYING WE'VE GOT TO WITH THE ONLY ONES. AND. IS HEALTH ISSUES AND AGAIN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. CONSPIRE IN MANY CASES FOR PEOPLE TO NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THAT THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO STUDY THAT NUMBER IT'S NOT A BIG NUMBER BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT YOUR L. A. COUNTY IS THAT. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAVELY DISABLED OR GRAVELY DISABLED CHASING HER ACTUALLY NOT. GETTING CARE AND THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD OF GREAT DISABILITY. ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT THIS ABOUT THE SCOPE IT'S ABOUT ITS- IMPLEMENTATION. OF FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER INTERPRETED BY FRONTLINE WORKERS BY COURTS- BY PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY- AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND MANY OF THEM ARE BROUGHT UP BY THE AUDIT. AND FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AS A PART OF- LPS LAW IS USED- IN A WAY THAT- CONSENSUALLY TAXES ARE A CUTE. RESOURCES IN PARTICULAR ARE OUR HOSPITALS AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS NOT KEEP SITUATION SO I'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER I HOPE THIS AFTERNOON BUT NOT ACUTE- SITUATIONS DO NOT REQUIRE A CUTE RESOURCES THEY REQUIRE I RESOURCES THAT ADDRESS A CHRONIC. CONDITION WE NEED TO DEVELOP A STANDARD THAT IS UNIFORMITY ACCOUNTABLE WHERE WE HAD INDICATORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MUCH CLEARER THAN FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER IN MY OPINION- IN TERMS OF- CHAIRMAN WHAT'S COMMENT ABOUT IT'S ABOUT SERVICES. AND WE ALL AGREE IT'S ABOUT SERVICES IT'S ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES IT'S ABOUT RESOURCES BUT THE ISSUE AND WHETHER IT'S A O. T. R. LPS. WE HAVE A GREAT DIFFICULTY ENGAGING CERTAIN PEOPLE. AND IN FACT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD IS DEEPLY CHALLENGED BY ENGAGEMENT GETTING PEOPLE TO ACCEPT CARE A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE TYPE OF CARE AND THE CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND IS DEEPLY BROKEN SYSTEM AND I APPRECIATE. COLLETTI'S COMMENTS ABOUT SB EIGHT OH THREE WHICH DIDN'T QUITE GO AS FAR AS WE WANTED BUT IS KEY TO THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL ALSO RECOGNIZE ABOUT THE STATE IS CALLIN CALLIN IS ACTUALLY INCORPORATING ENGAGEMENT AND THE ENGAGEMENT CAPACITY AS A PART OF WHAT'S NEEDED. IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD AND IS ROCKY KELLY SAID AN AVERAGE OF FORTY VISITS TO ENGAGE SOMEBODY. THAT TYPE OF WORK HASN'T REALLY BEEN FUNDED PROPERLY AND IT NEEDS TO BE I THINK KILLINGS MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION AND ON THE TOPIC OF THE GAUGE MEANT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE NEED A CONTINUUM OF TOOLS WITH A CONSERVATORSHIP TYPE. ENGAGEMENT TOOL AS THE VERY LAST RESORT BUT IF WE CAN HAVE A CONTINUE UNDER DEVELOPED THE TOOLS OF ENGAGEMENT WHEN IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO ENGAGE DESPITE RELENTLESS EFFORTS WITH GUARANTEED RESOURCES. THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL SHARE DECISION MAKING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES S. T. TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP CAN SCAN SERVER TO SHIP THOSE TO BE EXAMPLES OF THE CONTINUUM. I'M ENGAGEMENT TOOLS. IN TERMS OF FINDING WE NEED FUNDING THAT IS DEDICATED AND COMMITTED TO THOSE WHO IN L. A. RIVER KERR NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE RESOURCES ARE GUARANTEED UP FRONT WHEN WE DO RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. CURRENTLY THE FUNDING IS INADEQUATE IN TERMS OF IT BEING I'M GOING AND WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S EFFORT TO EXPAND ALL INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE NEED ON GOING FUNDING. ITS SUPER COMPLICATED TO ADMINISTER IT'S NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. IF WE DECIDE THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY THIS POPULATION WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THAT WILL DE PRIORITIZE OTHER POPULATIONS IN A ZERO SUM GAME. WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT AS A PART OF IT BEING COMPLICATED. WE NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY AND I WOULD POINT TO AN HSA IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE. IMAGES A FUNDING IT'S FENCED. THERE ARE A LOTS OF PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. WE NEED FLEXIBILITY TO USE IT TO GO AFTER. THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE AND WE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO OUTCOMES NOT TO REPORTS AND YOUR PROCESSES. IN TERMS OF- ENGAGEMENT WE NEVER EVER OUGHT TO BE USING ANY TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT TOOL. WITHOUT UP FRONT GUARANTEED RESOURCES STARTING WITH SHARED DECISION MAKING. SO IN SUMMARY. I BELIEVE THE STANDARDS NEED TO BE REVISITED TO BECOME CLEARER AND EASIER I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM I ALSO THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTINUUM OF ENGAGEMENT TOOLS. THAT'S A PROBLEM IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE NEED FUNDING THAT IS DEDICATED GUARANTEED I WOULD SAY THROUGH ENTITLEMENT. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIRTY SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE AND HOW WE HOLD OTHER PLANS. ACCOUNTABLE AGAIN IT'S A PROBLEM AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS YES WE DO NEED BETTER OVERSIGHT. BUT THAT OVERSIGHT NEEDS TO BE OF OUTCOMES. AND WE NEED TO BE A POWER TO ACHIEVE THEM. WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT QUESTIONS- DOCTOR I. THINK YOU JUST AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR WORK- IF YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST PERSON WHO SAID TODAY THAT WE THAT THE- PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE. STATE FUNDED. THOSE ARE THERE'S A COUNTY EMPLOYEES THAT WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE NOT STATE FUNDED DO YOU MEAN- THE DUBBED THE POPULATION THAT THEY'RE SERVING PRESIDENT AT THE POPULATIONS ARE SERVING OFTENTIMES COMES WITH A FUNDING STREAM. THAT THEN THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S USE OR OR WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO COUNTY EMPLOYEES HERE SAYING YOU KNOW GET. STATE MONEY OR THE WHOLE PROGRAM IS NOT FUNDED AND THEN HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DETERMINE. WHAT THE STATE WOULD FUND. THAT'S ASIDE FROM WHAT THE CLAIM IS ALREADY RECEIVING. THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. ABOUT SOMETHING WE WALK THROUGH ALL THE TIME- WHEN I MEAN IT'S NOT STATE FUNDED THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE. DO ACCESS STATE FUNDED SERVICES RIGHT IT'S THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND THEIR WORKLOAD AND CASELOAD. WHICH IS- DOESN'T RECEIVE ANY STATE OR OTHER FEDERAL FUNDING. SO THEY ARE COUNTY WORKERS- AND THEY THEY THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE CASE LAW THAT THEY RECEIVE- BECAUSE IT'S- ONE THING YOU HAVE TO RESPOND IN INVESTIGATE EVERY REFERRAL. AND THEN OF COURSE THE JUDGE DECIDES WHETHER TO- HAVE SOMEONE PUT INTO CONSERVATORSHIP. AND SO WHAT WAIT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO STATE FUNDING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES THAT THOSE FOLKS DO- THEY DO RECEIVE SOME TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT FUNDING THROUGH MEDIC CAL. BUT IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO- COUNT TOWARDS RECEIVING FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT- AND SO THAT'S- REALLY. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT'S SAYING OF THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATIVE PROGRAMS. WERE NOT A REAL LINE TO PROGRAM SO THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS THOSE WORKERS. TO THE REALIGNMENT FUNDING. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE MANY COUNTIES AUGMENT SIGNIFICANTLY- FIND EFFICIENCIES. SOME PUBLIC GUARDIANS CONSERVATORS OF L. A. COUNTY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. ARE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH- AND THEY CAN. ACCESS THE EFFICIENCIES AND THE FUNDING THAT IT COMES WITH BEING PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH- BUT THE CONSERVE GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATORS THOSE STYLES.ARE TYPICALLY. 100% COUNTY FUNDED. THIS THAT. CLARIFY IT HELPS AND I AND I GO IT'S JUST A THE QUESTION POPPED IN MY MIND THEN AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALLING HIM. CAN THEN CAN AND GUARDIANS BECOME A CONTRACT SERVICE- CAL LAME AS ANOTHER WAYS OF RECEIVING ANYWAY SO STUFF THAT'S FOR DOCTOR EVEN WHEN I THINK ABOUT NEXT YEAR. DR INDIA THANK YOU AND- I WOULDN'T MISS A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY THANK CHOLESKY KERIS KIERAN AND THERESA FOR THEIR ADVOCACY AND- REALLY ALLOWING US TO EMBRACE THE WHOLE PERSON WHO WERE TRYING TO HELP- THERESA SAID IT BEST WHEN SHE SAID THAT THE WHOLE PERSON CARES DOESN'T. WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHOLE CONTINUUM. OF CARE. EARLIER WHEN WE HEARD FROM OUR AUDITOR SHE SAID THAT THERE WAS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH WAS TO BE COMPLETED IN APRIL OF TWENTY ONE. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE COUNTIES HAVE PLAYED A ROLE HAVE PARTICIPATED ARE ABLE TO SHARE SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WE IS THE STATE CAN START TO PARTNER WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA I AM NOT AWARE SPECIFICALLY OF CANDY PARTICIPATION IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT- PERHAPS THE BEACH DAY MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. BUT THE STATE DID UNDERTAKEN NEEDS ASSESSMENT BASED ON LEGISLATION AND ALSO IN PREPARATION FOR LAUNCHING CAL AIMS- SO- I AGAIN I DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ABOUT THAT I DO NOT KNOW COUNTIES WERE. SURVEYED AND HAD SOME INPUT I DO NOT I RECALL SEEING THE FINAL PRODUCT- EARLIER WE HEARD FROM DR SHARON AS WELL ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING OF OUR SYSTEM AND- WHILE MANY OF THE INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR WERE ONE TIME IN NATURE I BELIEVE THAT THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL HELP TO DRAW. A MAP FOR US A ROAD MAP OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS FOR INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO GET MORE SPECIFICS ON. AND DOCTOR AND IF I'VE MADE CHAIR OF RESPOND THE NEED FOR DATA AND TRANSPARENCY IS. BEYOND CLEAR FOR ALL OF US AND WE WELCOME. THOSE EFFORTS I THINK THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A GREAT FIRST STEP- BUT CLEARLY WE NEED UP TO DATE. QUALITY DATA. SHERIFF I MIGHT. JUST REALLY QUICK I- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE HAVE IS- NOT HAVING ACCESS TO FEDERAL FUNDING FOR. BOB WHAT ARE CALLED I AM D. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE AND WE'VE SPOKEN IN THE STATE NUMBER OF TIMES HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A- THREE SPEND MASS A WAIVER FOR THE I AM DEEP. NOW THE IDEA WITH I AM THE EXCLUSION WOULD NECESSARILY BE TO EXPAND ALL THE BEDS AND TREATMENT BEDS ARE LOCKED ON TO BE BUDGET WOULD BE DISPLACED SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE- PUTTING INTO- TREATMENT BEDS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY. THE TWENTY THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT WHICH IS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER FLEXIBLE IF WE GET A LOT MORE ABOUT FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO CARE FOR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY IN DROUGHT ON FEDERAL MONEY. TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE FACILITY BASED CARE THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE. BOB THAT WOULD THAT WOULD REALLY HELP US WITH OUR FUNDING STREAMS AND OUR FLEXIBILITY. PRETTY GOOD WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR YOUR CLEAR MESSAGES TO US- AND- I VERY MUCH OF A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. I JUST WANNA SAY FOR THE RECORD LOOK- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ANYBODY UP HERE WANTS TO CREATE YOU KNOW IT WHEN I LOOK AT OVERSIGHT I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF CREATING MORE PAPERWORK AND MORE OF A BURDEN FOR YOU. FOR U. S. CLINICIANS OR WORK OR AND COUNTIES WHAT YOU KNOW I AM ALL ABOUT FLEXIBILITY I'M ALL ABOUT RESULTS- AND WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO STREAMLINE SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES QUITE FRANKLY- IT DOES TROUBLE ME THATWHEN I HER FROM THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THAT. WE HAD ISSUES DIFFERENT COUNTIES INTERPRETS THE STATUTE DIFFERENTLY WHICH MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT. TO OFFER SERVICES YOU KNOW FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE NEXT YOU KNOW AND AROUND THAT AND HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY THERE I BELIEVE- SO THEY WERE ALL THAT WERE ON THE SAME PAGE AND THAT'S THAT THAT IS DIFFICULT IN THE STATE IS DIVERSE IS THIS QUITE YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY. SO SO I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR INPUT AND YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AND TRUST WERE TAKEN WE'RE TAKING NOTES- AND- WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL WILL TAKE ABOUT. WE'LL TRY TO RECONVENE. AROUND ONE FORTY FIVE IF THAT'S OKAY. I KNOW IT'S A VERY SHORT LUNCH- SO FOR THE NEXT SPEAKERS JUST EVERYTHING'S GONNA MOVE DOWN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND- WE'LL KEEP GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH WELL NOW. YEAH OKAY. OKAY. I DON'T.

SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED AND- GOT YOU GUYS THAT WE HAVE YOU VALUE YOUR GENTLEMAN H. AT THAT TO AT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OF A PRESENTATION SO I'M SORRY I CAN'T COUNTY YES YES. SO WE COULD TRY TO KEEP IT WITHIN TWENTY WE'RE HI HOW ARE YOU PRETTY MUCH TRY TO MAKE IT SO WE'LL GET IN TWENTY MINUTES ON THE BATHROOM. IRAN THEN PLEASE OKAY GREAT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR AND- SO MY NAME'S COUNSELOR I'M EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIST WITH ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY. ACTICIN CALIFORNIA OVER NINETY THOUSAND EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS DURING THAT TIME AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO- YOU KNOW- IF VALUE WAIT AND SEEA LOT OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THAT A LOT OF RESEARCH PUBLISHED A LOT IN THE- OF EVIDENCE BASED- INTERESTING MATERIAL IN THAT TIME. AND I AM ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME REALLY EXCITING- SOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO HEARING ABOUT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF ASKING YOU FOR MORE MONEY. ARE YOU GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER INFINITELY BETTER CARE AND SAVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND IN THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY SYSTEM. SO IF I COULD START GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IS EVER SINCE WE'VE HAD LINEMEN PETROUS SHORT. WE PRETTY MUCH HAD A LOT OF THE OPTIONS BEING IF YOU WERE IN A CRISIS ARE YOU AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC SITUATION. YOU WOULD BE TOLD TO CALL NINE ONE ONE OR YOUR YOUR YOUR NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY E. R. EMERGENCY ROOM. WE'LL GO WITH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR EDT FOR THAT TODAY. SO EVEN IF YOU DO CALL NINE ONE ONE A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE GONNA END UP ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD AND THAT'S GOING TO END UP BRING YOU TO THAT SAME HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. FOR A MEDICAL EVALUATION AND MAYBE FURTHER PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION. AND THERE'S HISTORICALLY BEEN KIND OF AN ASSUMPTION THAT IF YOU END UP ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTEEN YOU GO T THE ER. THAT YOU'RE MOST LIKELY THAT I'M GOING TO GET A MEDICAL CLEARANCE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR. SEVENTY TWO HOURS OR LONGER FOR A PSYCHIATRIC STATE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IN THE PAST DECADE WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING A LOT OF OUR EFFORTS ON. THAT DVD IS NOT A GREAT PLACE FOR SOMEBODY TO GO WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT ON THAT THE STANDARD EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS NOT REALLY WELL SET UP FOR A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY. AND ACTUALLY CAN MAKE PEOPLE SYMPTOMS WORSE. HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE THESE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS BE THEY'D DROP IN CRISIS COUNSELING PROGRAMS MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS- ALTERNATIVE CRISIS STABILIZATION COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. AND IS WONDERFUL AS THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN AND HAVE PROVIDED SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT- FOLKS- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN ON FIFTY ONE FIFTIES INCOMING FOR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES TO HOSPITAL ER'S. HAS ONLY INCREASED DURING THAT SAME DECADE. AND SO WHICH NOW ABOUT ONE IN EVERY SEVEN PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL E. ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND INDEED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IS THERE FOR A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. THAT'S MORE THAN PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FOR CHEST PAIN OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR CAR ACCIDENTS IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS PEOPLE ARE IN E. OURS NOW. AND SO INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ALL OF HER TIME AND EFFORTS AND SAYING THE ER IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO GO. THERE THERE NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT ANYWAY AND IT MAY BE TIME TO SAY. HEY WHY DON'T WE START SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO AT THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL OF CARE AND THE GOOD THING I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT HAVING WORK WITH A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS. IS HOSPITALS ARE NOW SAYING. YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE OUR PATIENTS TO. IT'S TIME FOR US TO START SAYING YOU KNOW IF WE HAD A TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF. HEART ATTACKS COMING IN. WE WOULD MAKE EFFORTS TO BETTER TREAT HEART ATTACK PATIENTS. WE'RE SEEING LOTS AND LOTS MORE EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS. WERE RECOGNIZING NOW THAT THESE ARE OUR PATIENTS AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE EFFORTS TO. REALLY IMPROVE THE WAY WE HELP THESE FOLKS NEXT SLIDE. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE SEEING SO MANY MORE FOLKS AND THAT'S THE WE'RE JUST NOT ABLE TO DIVERT THEM TO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND THE REASON IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES THAT ARE JUST TOO ACUTE FOR COMMUNITY PROGRAMS MAYBE THAT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OR HAVE COAL MORBID INTOXICATION. OR OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS OR THEY'RE SO AGGRESSIVE OR AGITATED. THAT THEY'RE JUST TOO ACUTE FOR A COMMUNITY DROP IN A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE DENYING THEM HELP. ONCE THEY GET INTO THE E. ARE. TOO LONG WE'VE BEEN SAYING ONCE YOU GET TO THE E. ARE ALL OUR EFFORTS A CRISIS STABILIZATION AND COMMUNITY STOP. AND NOW ALL YOU'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS GET EVALUATED TO SEE IF YOU NEED TO GO TO A HOSPITAL OR NOT. BUT WHAT WE'VE ABLE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IS IF WE ACTUALLY INITIATE. CRISIS STABILIZATION AT THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL OF CARE. IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INCREDIBLE POSITIVE RESULTS. HEY GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN A LOT OF HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY IN THE CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE IS SOMETHING CALLED BOARDING. AND THAT IS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY PATIENT COMES IN. THE HOSPITAL DOES A MEDICAL CLEARANCE EXAMINE THE E. D. AND THEN THE PATIENT SITS AND WAITS. AND THEY'RE WAITING SOMETIMES FOR AN EVALUATION BY A COUNTY PERSON TO COME BY AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE. I DETERMINE THAT THEY NEED INPATIENT STABILIZATION ORDER ONE STATES EVEN BEEN DETERMINED. THEY'D HAVE TO STILL WAIT A LONG LONG TIME. FOR AN INPATIENT BED BECOME AVAILABLE. AND OFTEN THEY'RE NOT BEING HELPED AT ALL THERE'S NO TREATMENT EXCEPT MAYBE OCCASIONALLY SOME SEDATION. THEY'RE USUALLY STUCK WITH A SITTER OR SECURITY GUARD. SOMETIMES THEY'RE STRAPPED TO A GURNEY AND PUT IN A HALLWAY. AND AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ITSELF CAN BE. A BAD ENVIRONMENT FOR FOLKS AND ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR SYMPTOMS WORSE DURING THAT TIME. AND WHEN THEY'RE BOARDING THAT'S EVEN THAT MUCH WORSE AND SO SOMETIMES THIS CAN LAST. FOR HOURS AND SOMETIMES FOR DAYS IN FACT. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PLACE I TALKED TO WHERE THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF BOARDING IS OVER THIRTY HOURS. SO IMAGINE COME TO THE ER. IN THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE STATE. AND IT'S THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU JUST GET STRAPPED TO A GURNEY AND THEY'LL SAY WELL WE'LL SEE IN A- COUPLE OF DAYS. HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOME TREATMENT FOR YOU AT THAT TIME. OKAY COMPARED TO IF YOU CAME NTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND YOUR SHORT OF BREATH. AND YOUR HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK YOU. PLEASE HELP ME CAN YOU HELP. AND THEY WERE SAYING LIKE YES YES PLEASE COME WITH ME WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SEAT FOR YOU IN THE BCK. WE'RE GONNA CALL AROUND TRYING TO FIND AN ASTHMA HOSPITAL AND TRANSFER YOU TO. WE SHOULD HAVE AN ASTHMA HOSPITAL FOR YOU IN ABOUT THIRTY HOURS. SIT TIGHT. TRY TO RELAX. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH PEOPLE ARE HAVING PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES. AND WHAT'S ON REALLY UNFORTUNATE ABOUT IT IS ACTUALLY IF WE HAD INITIATE TREATMENT. WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE PEOPLE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE AND GOING HOME. IN LESS TIME THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SITTING THERE WITH NOTHING ELSE GOING ON. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FEDERAL LAW. I SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW THIS BUT JUST TO REITERATE. EMTALA IS THE FEDERAL LAW THAT ANYBODY COMES TO E. R. MUST BE SEEN. THEY MUST BE EVALUATED SEE IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION AND IF SO THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT CONDITION STABILIZED OR THE NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL. FEDERAL LAW THE INTEL LAW SAYS THAT PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES ARE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. AND SO. THEY NEED TO BE EVALUATED AND ATTEMPTED TO STABILIZE IN THAT SAME WAY WERE ADMITTED TRADITIONALLY THEY'VE JUST BEEN TRYING TO ADMIT THOSE FOLKS. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY STABILIZE HIM IN THE E. R. AS WELL. AND IF WE LOOK AT THEM AS MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY ARE. THEN WE STOP THINKING LIKE YOU KNOW THE STIGMATIZING IDEAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE YOU DON'T BELONG HERE. YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. DISEASES THE BRAIN DON'T BELONG HERE. THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL OTHER SPEAKERS TODAY WHO HAVE MENTIONED THAT. THESE ARE SERIOUS SERIOUS ILLNESSES THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM. THAT ARE NOT CHOICES THEY'RE NOT JUST THINGS THAT THAT THE- PICKED THE WRONG. DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NO THESE ARE ACTUALLY DISEASES OF THE BRAIN TISSUE. AND IF WE LOOK AT THEM AS MEDICAL ISSUES AND REALIZE THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED OUR HELP AT THE ER. MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR SERIOUS SERIOUS LEVEL ILLNESSES TO BE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WELL ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE WE HEARD ABOUT IT HISTORICALLY IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE BACKING UP IN THE E. OURS. WHY DON'T WE BUILD MORE INPATIENT BEDS AND WE CAN TRANSFER THEM TO AND THAT WILL CLEAR OUT THE E. OURS BUT THAT PERPETUATES THAT SAME SYSTEM LIKE I WAS SAYING WITH THE ASTHMA ATTACK WHERE. LET'S JUST HAVE YOU SIT AND WAIT UNTIL WE FIND SOMETHING ELSEWHERE AND WE DON'T DO THAT FOR ANY OTHER KIND OF MEDICAL EMERGENCY. THAT WE SEE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN FACT IF WE COMPARED IT TO CHEST PAIN. IF YOU CAME INTO THE R. WITH CHEST PAIN YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK. ONLY 10220% OF THOSE FOLKS END UP GETTING HOSPITALIZED. AND IN FACT IF WE ACTUALLY INITIATE THAT SAME KIND OF STABILIZING EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. AT THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL CARE WE FIND THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME KIND OF STABILIZING CARE. AND GET FOLKS HOME IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES THE SAME WAY WE CAN WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE KEY ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO REALIZE THERE'S A SPECTRUM OF KERR AND I'VE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS TODAY. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR. MILD TO MODERATE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS CARE VOLUNTARILY. THAT'S ALWAYS OUR FIRST CHOICE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE TO VERY SEVERE LEVEL OF CARE YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT IF YOU'RE IN A CAR ACCIDENT. THAT WOULD THEY WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE- THE DROP IN. URGENT CARE NEXT TO THE WALGREENS. YOU'D WANT TO GO TO THE TRAUMA CENTER WHERE THE TRAUMA SURGEON CAN HELP YOU OUT CORRECT. IT'S THE SAME KIND OF THING WITH SEVERE SEVERE. MENTAL ILLNESS WE NEED DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CURE ACUITY AND SOMETIMES THAT HOSPITAL ER IS INDEED THE RIGHT PLACE. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT HAVE WE HAD TRADITIONALLY THAT'S AVAILABLE AT THAT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BEST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY STATIONED THERE WHO CAN HELP YOU OUT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN DO AN EVALUATION THERE MAY EVEN BE A MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER PSYCHIATRIST THERE. DID THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT MOSTLY AND EVEN SOMETIMES THEY'LL HAVE THE COUNTY WILL HAVE SOMEBODY WILL COME AND HELP FOLKS OUT THERE. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT REALLY THEY AREN'T DOING MUCH BEYOND DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE APPROPRIATE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AN INPATIENT FACILITY. THEY MIGHT HELP SAY YOU'RE DOING OKAY WE CAN GET YOU BACK HOME LET'S PLUG YOU INTO COMMUNITY SERVICES. MORE LIKELY THEY'RE GONNA SAY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SEVERE ILLNESS LET'S START TRYING TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE. INPATIENT HOSPITAL TO TRANSFER YOU TO AND WE'RE GOING TO AUTHORIZES. THE MISSING PIECE THE BIG HUGE DONUT HOLE IN THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE DOING IT THAT WAY AS- WHAT ABOUT INITIATING TREATMENT WHAT ABOUT ACTUALLY. STARTING CARE WHILE THEY'RE IN THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND ITS THE BIGGEST MISSING PIECE IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IS WHY AREN'T WE INITIATING CARE WHEN SOMEBODY'S IN THAT EMERGENCY YOU LEVEL AND REALLY REALLY NEEDS HELP. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO INITIATE THAT EMERGENCY CARE WE DO WE IF WE FOLLOW WHAT ARE KNOWN AMONG US AND EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY'S THE SIX GOALS ARE RUMORED TO SEE PSYCHIATRIC CARE. AND REAL QUICKLY IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH THESE BECAUSE THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE WHOLE NEXT PART AND MAKE IT ALL MUCH MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE. FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO EXCLUDE MEDICALLY THE ALLERGIES AND SURE MEDICAL STABILITY WHEN SOMEBODY'S HAVING A SEVERE MEDICAL EMERGENCY- THE MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY MAYBE IT'S HALLUCINATIONS MAYBE SEVERE SUICIDALITY. SEVERE ANXIETY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRST OFF THAT THIS IS NOT. DUE TO A MEDICAL CONDITION WISE THAT. BASED ON WHICH STUDY LOOK AT ANYWHERE FROM 10225% OF PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES. ARE EITHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE MIMICKING WHAT APPEAR TO BE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS FOR. A PSYCHIATRIC TO GET CONDITION IS BEING EXACERBATED BY A MEDICAL CONDITION. AND THOSE ARE SOMETIMES LIFE THREATENING SOMETIMES HEAD TRAUMA WITH IT BREATHE BLEEDING INSIDE THE BRAIN CAN LOOK LIKE- SOMEBODY IS JUST CONFUSED OR DISORIENTED. SOMETIMES SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE. ABNORMALITIES IN THEIR THYROID GLAND OR THEY MAY HAVE A TIME TO TALK TO DRUM THEY'VE INGESTED POISON. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN LOOK LIKE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. AND I THERE'S TOO MANY STORIES OF PEOPLE SAYING OH THIS IS JUST LIKE SEND THEM FOR COUNSELLING. AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A VERY VERY SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITION AND BAD BAD OUTCOMES. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- DON'T JUST ASSUME THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS COUNSELING AS I HEARD SOMEBODY MENTIONED BEFORE BUT THAT THESE ARE SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL. CONDITIONS AND WE GIVE SOMEBODY A GOOD MEDICAL EVALUATION ONCE WE ARE INSURE THAT THIS IS INDEED. APPEAR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY AND THAT WE'VE RULED OUT ALL THE NON. NON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS WE WANT TO RAPIDLY STABILIZE THE ACUTE CRISIS THE ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY CONDITION. AND I THINK THAT IT TOO OFTEN HISTORICALLY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS HAVE KIND OF PUT PSYCH PATIENTS ON THE BACK BURNER. MAKES SENSE OF SOMEBODY'S COMING IN WITH A HEART ATTACK OR CAR ACCIDENT. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A RECOGNITION ABOUT HOW SERIOUS I AFTER CONDITIONS CAN BE. BECAUSE FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE LISTENING RIGHT NOW CAN WE POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BE SO SUICIDAL. THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER BREATH. AND YOU JUST WANT TO DIE YOU JUST WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE OVER WHAT CAN I FEEL LIKE I HOPE NONE OF US EVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT FEELING. OR HOW ABOUT HEARING VOICES IN YOUR HEAD THAT ARE TELLING YOU. TO KILL YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. AND WHAT WHAT MUST THAT BE LIKE THAT MUST BE LIKE THE MOST AWFUL THING YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE. AND THOSE ARE REAL VOICES THEY'RE HEARING IF YOU DID A BRAIN SCAN. OF SOMEBODY WHO'S WITH SCHIZOPHRENIC WHO'S HEARING VOICES. THE SAME PART OF THEIR BRAIN THAT WOULD LIGHT UP YOU HEARING ME TALK RIGHT NOW. LIGHTS UP WITH THEM THEY'RE LITERALLY HEARING VOICES. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO ACT ON THOSE VOICES. BUT IT MUST BE SO. DIFFICULT AND IS THAT AS BAD. AS AS BEING YOU KNOW HAVING A BROKEN ARM. MAYBE THEY NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED. AND SO YOU KNOW I HAD COLLEAGUES SAY TO ME. YOU KNOW SCOTT THE ONE THING ABOUT PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES WE DON'T HAVE A BLOOD TEST THAT PROVES THAT SOMEBODY'S HAVING PSYCH EMERGENCY WE DON'T HAVE AN- X. RAY THAT PROVES THERE'S PSYCH EMERGENCY. AND I SAID YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T HAVE. A BLOOD TEST OR AN X. RAY TO PROVE EITHER. PAIN WE ALL KNOW WHAT PAIN FEELS LIKE. SO MAYBE. I'VE WE ALL KNOW WHAT PAIN IS. SO THINK OF YOUR JUST GOING OH MY GOD MY HEAD SPLITTING I REALLY NEED HELP PLEASE HELP ME NOW AND IMAGINE SOMEBODY SAYING. WELL PLEASE COME IN HAVE A SEAT WILL. GET SOMEBODY TO SEE YOU IN A FEW HOURS TO BE NO PLEASE HELP ME NOW I REALLY NEED HELP. AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PATIENTS ARE FEELING. AND WHEN WE DO HELP THEM WE WANT TO AVOID COERCION TO MUCH OF. HISTORIC PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE HAS BEEN ABOUT. I'M THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE PATIENT SHUT UP WE'RE GOING TO TIE YOU DOWN WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A SHOT. WE WANT TO GET RID OF THAT. INSTEAD FORMA THERAPEUTICS ALLIANCE WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT COLLABORATION NOT COERCION. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME LET'S GET YOU THROUGH THIS. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. AND THAT MEANS TREAT IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. AND SO MUCH OF OUR HISTORIC APPROACH HAS BEEN THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR YOU IS FIND YOU AN INPATIENT PSYCH BED. BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS WHO WOULD REALLY WANT TO BE LOCKED INTO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AGAINST YOUR WILL. UNLESS YOU REALLY REALLY NEEDED IT. IF THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION WHERE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING WHERE WE'RE BEING LOCKED INTO RESTRAINTS IS PROBABLY THE MOST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. NEXT MOST RESTRICTED BE JUST LOCKED INSIDE OF A HOSPITAL. LET'S KEEP MOVING TOWARDS THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING WHICH IS ME BEING HOME ABLE TO COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS FEELING SAFE. THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO AND SO. THE IDEA THAT THE SOLUTION IS ALWAYS IMPATIENT. IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY WE CAN HELP SOMEBODY. AND WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. WE WANT TO GET SOMEBODY BACK HOME BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. AND IN DOING SO WE WANT TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD WARM HAND OFF TO COMMUNITY SERVICES AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE CONNECTED. AND NOT JUST OPENING THE DOOR TO THE ER AND SAYING HERE'S A PAMPHLET. BUT ACTUALLY CONNECTING THEM TO SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT. THE PEOPLE GET OUT AND- DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN MY GOAL AS AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIST HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO PUT MYSELF OUT OF WORK. BY DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB. THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OR CRISIS AGAIN NEXT SLIDE. SO THE MODEL THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT REALLY REFLECTS. ALL OF THESE CONCEPTS IS CALLED THE M. PATH MODEL AND M. PATTERSON ACRONYM STANDS FOR EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC. ASSESSMENT TREATMENT AND HEALING. FACILITY AND THESE ARE LIKE ICY USE ADJACENT TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. THAT PEOPLE CAN BE SWIFTLY MOVED OUT OF THE E. R. RIGHT INTO A MORE APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW THERAPEUTIC SETTING. THAT STILL THAT SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT STEAM EMERGENCY HOSPITAL DEPARTMENT. LEVEL OF CARE. BUT IT'S DESIGNED REALLY FOR. THE KIND OF EMERGENCIES THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A PSYCHE AFTER MONTHS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IF WE GET PEOPLE INTO A SETTING LIKE THIS. THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WE WOULD HAVE HELD TO GO TO AN INPATIENT FACILITY BEFORE. 75280% OF THEM WE CAN GET BETTER AND STABLE. AND GET BACK HOME IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IT'S JUST AN AMAZING AMAZING TURNAROUND. IT'S AND IF YOU SAY LIKE WHAT AT THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HOW WOULD SOMEBODY BE AN E. R. AND WE MOVE THEM SOMEWHERE THAT'S THAT'S MORE APPROPRIATE WE DON'T DO THAT WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT I SAY. IF YOU CAME INTO THE ER BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY DOOR IN THE HOSPITAL AT THREE IN THE MORNING. AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY THE ER DOC WOULD SEE YOU AND SAY LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT HERE IN THE YEAR LET'S GET YOU OVER TO LABOR AND DELIVERY. IT'S EXACT SAME KIND OF THING WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OVER TO THE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY UNIT WHICH IS CALLED THE M. PATH UNIT. AND WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT WE GET EVERYBODY THERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GET THEM OUT OF THE E. R. WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT A GOOD SETTING. WHERE WE HAVE NO EXCLUSIONS WE TRY TO FIND ALL THE- PATIENTS WE THE WE WERE JUST NOT GOING TO FIND REASONS TO NOT HAVE THEM COME OVER WE WANT TO HAVE MORE REASON TO HAVE THEM COME OVER. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE A BETTER ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE EVERYBODY SEE A PSYCHIATRIST OR A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER. IN LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER ARRIVAL SO MANY TIMES WE FIND OF REASON PATIENTS HAVE A TOUGH TIME IN PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES OF THEY'LL BE LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE HOURS I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR YET. LET'S GET THAT DOCTOR OR THAT PSYCHIATRIC PROVIDER THE VERY FRONT OF THE LINE IF MEDICATIONS ARE INDICATED THAT ARE GOING TO RELIEVE THAT ANXIETY THAT STRESSED THAT PSYCHOSIS. LET'S GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY AND LET'S HAVE THIS ENVIRONMENT BE A MUCH MORE THERAPEUTIC SPACIOUS RELAX HOME LIKE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS COMPLETELY DISTINCT FROM THE MEDICAL YOUR NEXT NEXT SLIDE. AND THAT DESIGN IS. ABOUT BEING SPACIOUS IT'S A LARGE OPEN SPACE WHICH WE CALL A MILIEU WHERE PATIENTS CAN ALL BE TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM. IT MIGHT SEEM COUNTER AND INTUITIVE. BUT ACTUALLY HUMAN CONTACT IN THOSE FIRST FEW HOURS OF A CRISIS. ARE AMAZING FOR PEOPLE. WHEN YOU WERE SUICIDAL YOU THOUGHT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD HATED YOU IF YOU GET LOCKED IN A ROOM BY YOURSELF WHAT'S CHANGED. BUT MAYBE YOU'RE IN A ROOM THERE'S OTHER FOLKS THERE. YOU MAKE A NEW FRIEND. LIFE SEEMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER. MAYBE IF YOU'RE PARANOID PSYCHOSIS YOU GET LOCKED IN A ROOM YOU THINK THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF PLOTTING AGAINST YOU ARE LAUGHING AT YOU. IF EVERYBODY'S THERE AROUND YOU YOU CAN SEE THEM. AND THINGS SEEM A LOT LIKE BETTER. WE HAVE THE NURSING STAFF INTERSPERSED AS OPPOSED TO BEING. LOCKED BEHIND A BULLETPROOF FISH BOWL THAT ARE SEPARATED FROM THE PATIENTS. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH. THE OPEN SPACE AND THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NURSING STAFF. REDUCES A LOT OF THE ANXIETY. THE ANGER THE FRUSTRATION THAT CAUSES AGGRESSION. AND VIOLENCE AND AGITATION. IT'S ME IT'S JUST THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND WE WANT TO HAVE EVERYBODY HAVE ENOUGH SPACE. BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL PARANOID. A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS. NEED TO PACE AROUND FOR EXAMPLE TO HELP THEM WORK OFF THEIR- AGITATION OR THE ANXIETY. YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON A REGULAR E. R. SOMEBODY WOULD YELL YOU GET BACK IN YOUR ROOM I'M CALLING SECURITY. HERE WE GIVE YOU THE SPACE TO WALK AROUND. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. TO MOVE ABOUT. INSTEAD OF BEING IN A SYMBOL AND A SMALL- YOU KNOW OBSERVATION BAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU'RE IN THIS BIG ROOM YOU PICK YOUR OWN RECLINER. YOU'RE ABLE TO GO THERE AND CHOOSE THE RECLINER. YOU CAN SIT IN IT. AND YOU CAN ENGAGE IN ONE TO ONE OR SMALL GROUP THERAPY YOU CAN PLAY A GAME YOU CAN WATCH TV YOU CAN READ A BOOK. OR YOU CAN FOLD IT FLAT YOU CAN GRAB YOURSELF A PILLOW AND BLANKET. TAKE A NAP. YOU CAN ALSO GO OUT GRAB YOURSELF A SNACK. OR BEVERAGE NOBODY'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HAVE TO. BEG FOR ANYTHING YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE SAY. PLEASE NURSING STAFF CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF WATER. YOU JUST GO UP AND GET IT YOURSELF. IF YOU WANT TO WALK AROUND PACE. EVERYBODY'S GONNA GO THIS IS GREAT. IT SAYS SPACE IS ABOUT EIGHTY SQUARE FOOT PER PATIENT. AND THIS IS WELL DESIGNED NOW THAT THIS IS THE NATIONAL STANDARD. THE FACILITY GUIDELINES INSTITUTE GUIDELINES NOW HAVE THIS. NATION WIDE EIGHTY SQUARE FEET PER PATIENT IN A UNIT LIKE THIS. AND IF SOMEBODY IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME THE NURSING STAFF CAN QUICKLY RECOGNIZE IT. GO AND HELP THEM WITH DE ESCALATION CALMING TECHNIQUES. AND IF IT'S STILL A TOUGHER TIME. THEY CAN BRING THEM TO AN UNLOCKED ROOM AROUND THE PERIMETER CALL THE CALMING ROOM. WHERE INSTEAD OF PUTTING SOMEBODY IN LOCKS INCLUDED. OR FORCIBLE RESTRAINTS THEY CAN GO IN THERE AND DECOMPRESS. AND FEEL A LITTLE BETTER AND GET OUT OF THERE QUICKLY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO HERE'S SOME- PHOTOS YOU CAN SEE OF WHAT SOME OF THESE UNITS LOOK LIKE. WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THEM AS YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE UNDER UTILIZED SPACE AND FOR A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT- BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED WALLS THESE ARE JUST OPEN ROOMS. LITTLE BIT OF PAIN AND SOME NEW FURNITURE. YOU CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT UNIT. AND IT'S SO DIFFERENT WHEN WHAT THE E. R. WAS AND YOU CAN JUST SEE FROM SOME OF THESE PHOTOS WHERE. YOU CAN MOVE ABOUT YOU CAN HAVE THE BIG COMFY RECLINERS. AND THE BANG FOR THE BUCK IS JUST INCREDIBLE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL STAFF THAT WORK IN IT INCLUDING PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST WHICH ARE WORTH TEN TIMES THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD. IF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND A CRISIS AND THEY'RE THERE AS PART OF OUR STAFF AND SAY HEY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. I'VE BEEN THERE TOO WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. AND THEY REALLY REALLY HELP US. WORK TOWARDS OUR GOAL OF THAT LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO FOR THE PATIENT BENEFITS IT'S THIS WONDERFUL TROM INFORMED UNIT WERE OF WAITING ALL THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MIGHT TRIGGER- BAD OUTCOMES BUT INSTEAD IS A VERY CALMING ENVIRONMENT. WHERE THE OTHER BIG KEY PART IS THAT. AFTER THAT INITIAL EVALUATION BY A PSYCHIATRIST. WE'RE GOING TO. INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU NEED TO GO TO INPATIENT OR WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA START A TREATMENT PLAN WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW SOMEBODY DOES FOR A FEW HOURS. IN THIS COMFORTABLE THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT. MAYBE THEY'RE GONNA GO SIT AND PLAY A BOARD GAME AND JUST KIND OF GET DISTRACTED A BIT. AND ALLOW THEMSELVES TO RELAX AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE THEY'RE DOING BETTER WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO DECIDE TOO QUICKLY BUT WAIT. SIX EIGHT TEN HOURS. AND IF WE DO THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. SOMEBODY'S ON A TO A COURSE TOWARDS GETTING BETTER RATHER THAN TRYING TO DECIDE ONLY THAT FIRST HOUR WHEN THEY'RE AT THEIR WORST. WHAT THE DISPOSITION TWENTY FOUR HOURS FROM NOW SHOULD BE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUALLY RE OBSERVE REEVALUATE AND OBSERVE. AND AS WE DO THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET BETTER. AND WE GET SOME REAL BANG FOR THE BUCK WHERE IS THE LONGER WE WORK WITH THEM. THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING BETTER WE CAN START WORKING ON A PLAN TO GET THEM BACK HOME. AND PLUGGED INTO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. BECAUSE OF THIS WHOLE DESIGN IS ALL SET UP TO MAKE IT MORE CALMING AND- RELAXED. THERAPEUTIC WE HAVE ALMOST ELIMINATED THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS WITH THIS POPULATION. WHICH THIS IS A POPULATION THAT. THERE THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE- IS. TYPICALLY ABOUT 30% OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS. THE AVERAGE EMPAT UNIT ACROSS THE NATION. IS AVERAGING ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND OF THOSE SAME FOLKS GOES IN RESTRAINTS. SO INSTEAD OF THREE HUNDRED OUT OF A THOUSAND IT'S ONE OUT OF A THOUSAND. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONE EVIDENCE BASED INFORMATION THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL CALLED ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE DID A STUDY OF THEIR EMPAT UNIT. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. HERE'S SOME OF THE GREAT METRICS THEY CAME OUT WITH. THEY REDUCE THE EASY THE OVERALL LENGTH OF STAY OF PATIENTS IN THE ER. FROM SIXTEEN HOURS TO JUST OVER FOUR HOURS. AND THAT'S INCLUDING ALL THE TIME IT TOOK THEM TO LIKE. DETOX THEM FROM AN OVERDOSE OR OR GET THEM THROUGH A WITHDRAWAL OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO. THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETIME IN THE E. ARE NO MATTER WHAT BUT THEY DROPPED ALL THAT BOARDING TIME TO ALMOST ZERO. THEY REDUCE THE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSIONS BY OVER FIFTY PERCENT. BUT HERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WOULDN'T EVEN BEEN OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST POINT. THE FOLLOW UP OF THESE FOLKS WANT TO DISCHARGE HIM THEY DO SUCH A BETTER JOB OF GETTING THEM CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITY THAN EVEN HAD THEY BEEN AN IMPATIENT. AND MAYBE IT'S ABOUT BEING THERAPEUTIC RATHER THAN COERCIVE. BUT THE HAD A 60% IMPROVEMENT IN PEOPLE FOLLOWING UP WITH THEIR OUTPATIENT PLANS. GOING TO THEIR OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS THEY ACTUALLY WERE DOING BETTER. AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THEY HAD A BETTER EXPERIENCE IN THEIR CRISIS. AND FOR PEOPLE SAY LIKE OH IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEY WILL COME. AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET RECIDIVISM AND MAYBE YOUR COVER NOT HOLDING THEM LONG ENOUGH AND THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO COME BACK. ACTUALLY WE'VE SEEN JUST THE OPPOSITE AT ALL THESE PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND IN THIS PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE BASED JOURNAL. THEY SHOWED THAT THE THIRTY DAY RETURN OF THESE PATIENTS TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ACTUALLY DROPPED BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THIS IS HAVING THIS PROGRAM OPEN FOR YEAR COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THEY OPEN. AND ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED THAT CHANGED THESE DYNAMICS AND JUST AMAZING. INCLUDING REALLY REDUCING THE RECIDIVISM WHICH IS SOMETHING I THINK WE ALL LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN NEXT SLIDE. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA- JUST OPEN ONE UP THIS YEAR. IT WITHIN SIX MONTHS THEY HAD A FIFTY EIGHT READ 8% REDUCTION IN THEIR HOSPITAL ADMISSION JUST SEVENTEEN PERCENT. OF THE PATIENTS THEY ARE SEEING THAT USED TO GO TO IMPATIENT. NOW GETTING ADMITTED YOU CAN SEE A NICE PICTURE OF THEIR UNIT AS WELL NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE THEM WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AT THE PROVIDENCE LITTLE COMPANY OF MARY HOSPITAL WHICH IS IN LOS ANGELES IN THE SAMPEDRO AREA THEY HAVE A TWELVE CHAIR UNIT WHICH OPENED UP FOUR YEARS AGO. AND THEY'RE HAVING THE SAME KIND OF METRICS 81% OF THE FOLKS COMING THERE AND FIFTY ONE FIFTIES GET DISCHARGED HOME. OR TO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IS ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH IS WHAT'S GREAT IN THESE UNITS. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO SHORT GOING TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THAT UNIT. YOU WANT TO BE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE KEEPING THEM TO SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE PROBABLY SENDING TOO MANY OF INDIAN PATIENTS WANT TO BE THERE LONG ENOUGH SETTING STABILIZE. GET BACK HOME GET BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. AND AGAIN YOU SEE. ONE OR TWO OUT OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS GOING IN RESTRAINTS INSTEAD OF THREE HUNDRED NEXT FIVE. NOT FAR FROM HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THERE'S A GREAT PROGRAM WHICH IS A COMMUNITY PROGRAM PUT TOGETHER BY SACRAMENTO COUNTY MENTAL HELTH. AND THE DIGNITY HOSPITAL THERE THEY'VE DONE SOME AMAZING THINGS TO THIS WAS A HOSPITAL THAT WAS AVERAGING IN LENGTH OF STAY OF OVER THIRTY TWO HOURS FOR THE AVERAGE FIFTY ONE FIFTY PATIENTS. WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF OPENING UP THEIR EMPAT UNIT THEY DROP THAT ALMOST BY HALF. TWO MONTHS LATER IT WAS DROPPED BY THREE QUARTERS A 77% REDUCTION. NOW THEIR AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE ONCE THEY'RE DECLARED MEDICALLY CLEAR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO MOVING TO. THE EMPAT UNIT IS AN HOUR. TO THE COMMUNITY AND IF YOU WANTED OF PATIENTS ARE THINKING THIS IS A GOOD EXPERIENCE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. SAY THEY WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS AMAZING CONSIDERING THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE BROUGHT IN INVOLUNTARILY AND EVEN THEY SAY THIS IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IS NOW RECOGNIZED NATIONWIDE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR MENTAL WELLNESS USED TO BE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL BEAVER HEALTH CAME UP WITH THE SOMETHING CALLED THE ROADMAP TO AN IDEAL CRISIS SYSTEM. EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THEY SAID THAT EMPAT UNITS ARE COMPLETELY NECESSARY. BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SOME PATIENTS WHO ARE GOING TO END UP COMING HE OURS AND WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM THERE. AND THEY SAY THERE SHOULD BE ONE IN EVERY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND ONE LAST SLIDE PLEASE. AND THIS IS THE PART I MENTIONED AT THE OPENING ABOUT SAVING MONEY AFFORD A YEAR OLD AND THE AVERAGE PERSON GOING. ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY IF THEY END UP IN AN INPATIENT FACILITY IN THEIR A MEDIC CAL PATIENT. THAT AFTER AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY. AND AN AVERAGE BUILDING IS USUALLY COSTING THAT COUNTY MEDIC CAL ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PATIENT. THE AVERAGE DAY IN AND EMAT UNIT. IS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE'RE AVOIDING. 75280% OF THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WHO WOULD BE GOING TO INPATIENT. IF THERE WASN'T AN EMPAT UNIT I MEAN THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE IF YOU'RE ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE. IF WE'RE ABLE TO TAP THE MINUTE EMPAT UNIT STABILIZE AND GET BACK HOME DROPPED A FIFTY ONE FIFTY. IT COST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS INSTEAD OF TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THREE OUT OF FOUR TIMES FOUR OUT OF FIVE TIMES. IF WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT THREE OUT OF FOUR TIMES. THAT MEANS FOR EVERY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MEDIC CAL PAYS FOR HIM BACK HERE. THE AVOID THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THINK HOW QUICKLY THAT GETS INTO THE MILLIONS. SO THE KEY THING AND ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TESTIFYING TODAY THAT. DIFFERENT COUNTIES DO THINGS DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE HAVE THIS DISJOINTED SYSTEM ESPECIALLY WITH THE WAY THAT MEDIC CAL WORKS. SOME COUNTIES. HAVE DECLINED TO PAY FOR IMPACT UNITS THERE'S A WILL WAS A GREAT EMPAT UNIT THAT HAD TO CLOSE AFTER THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAID. YOU DIDN'T ASK US PERMISSION TO OPEN THIS UP SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET ANY MONEY FROM US FOR. SO THEY HAD TO THEY HAD TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS THERE'S OTHER THAT WILL ACTUALLY PAY FOR IT. LET'S SAY THAT THEY'LL PUT A CAP. BECAUSE AGAIN. IT WASN'T PART OF THEIR PLAN. AND YOU KNOW IT IS THERE'S NO OTHER AREA OF MEDICAID OR MEDICARE ALL THAT. ACTUALLY DOES THINGS THIS WAY WHICH IS VERY VERY STRANGE IF YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP. A NEW WAY TO TREAT HEART ATTACKS IN YOUR HOSPITAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET PERMISSION OF THE COUNTY. HEART ASSOCIATION TO DO SO THE COUNTY HEART ASSOCIATION DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE EVERY TIME. PATIENT HAS A HEART ATTACK THAT YOU GET REIMBURSED. THESE ARE MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE EMERGENCY REQUIREMENTS THAT BY FEDERAL LAWSUIT THAT THEIR MEDICAL EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. AND YET. SOME COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN THAT THEY WOULD PREFER NOT TO PAY FOR THIS LEVEL OF CARE. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS PART OF THE HEARING TODAY WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT. WHEN SOMETHING GETS THAT POINT WERE. IT'S AT THAT HOSPITAL LEVEL OF CARE. THERE SHOULD BE A STANDARD STATEWIDE WHERE IT'S REIMBURSED. THERE'S OTHER STATES THAT DO THIS WHERE THEY JUST SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS THE SAME AS HEART ATTACKS. CAR ACCIDENTS ASTHMA ATTACKS. IT SHOULD BE REIMBURSED THE SAME WAY RE REIMBURSE MEDICAL CARE. AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE A DIFFERENT THING DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY YOU'RE IN. AND IF YOU BREAK YOUR LEG IN. SAN JOSE AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW. LOS ANGELES COUNTY MEDICARE ALL YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET YOURSELF TAKEN CARE OF. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THEY MIGHT JUST SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO COVER BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT COUNTY AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THAT EMERGENCY SOOTHING. HEALING THERAPEUTIC CARE. WHERE THEY ARE IF THEY'RE MEDIC CAL. THEY DESERVE THAT LEVEL OF CARE JUST LIKE THEY DESERVE FOR ANY OTHER. MEDICAL EMERGENCY. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE LAST SLIDE- YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- I WANT TO OUR NEXT PANELIST- MISSED YOUR- DINER STEEN- I THINK YOU ARE. UP THERE SOMEWHERE THE CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN OKAY TERRIFIC THANK YOU. SO YES SAID MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME IS ROBERT INTERESTING I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR F THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CLINIC AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW IN WASHINGTON DC. NINE ADDRESSING TODAY FROM OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC FROM HOME THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS SOCIETIES APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THAT. THERE ARE MANY SOURCES FOR THIS CONCERN AMONG OTHERS AMONG SOME OF THEM. THE PERSISTENT ALMOST POPULATION MANY OF WHOM HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THAT HAVE LED TO SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. HIGH PROFILE IF EXCEEDINGLY RARE INCIDENTS IN WHICH ALLEGEDLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE HAVE CAUSED MASS INJURY OR DEATH. ACTUALLY IT'S EASIER TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. I GET IN THE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE DEALING WITH GUN VIOLENCE. OKAY INCREASING CONCERN WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN JAILS OR PRISONS WEB MENTAL DISORDERS. WHICH ARE OFTEN I'M I'M SEATED OR UNDER TREATED. I OF COURSE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHICH HAS INCREASED THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. FIRST RESPONDERS PEOPLE AT THE ECONOMIC MARGINS AND OTHER. THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND AUTONOMY INTEREST ON THE ONE. SIDE IS LEGITIMATE AND IN FACT SOLITARY INTEREST IN MAKING CARE AVAILABLE AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC ON THE OTHER. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EASY TO RESULT. WE MUST BE SKEPTICAL OF EASY FIXES INCREASING THE SIZE OF PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS MAKING IT EASIER TO SIMPLY CONNECT PEOPLE ARE OR INVOLUNTARILY TREAT THEM. WELL TAKING THE PROBLEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED CONFLICTS SERIOUSLY. AND WHERE WE HAVE PERCENT PUBLIC POLICY TO A FAILED OR AT LEAST NOT FULLY SUCCEEDED. WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE REASONS FOR THOSE LESS THAN OPTIMAL OUTCOMES AVOIDING SUPERFICIALLY APPEALING. CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTEES ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR HOLDING THIS JOINT HEARING TODAY TO ADDRESS THESE THORNY QUESTIONS. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT COERCIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT FORCED MEDICATION ANOTHER MODERN. ARE LIKELY TO WORK IN THE LONG RUN I NOTED THAT THE- PRIOR SPEAKER SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF NON CORE. AVOIDING COLLISION PROVISION OF SERVICES. WHICH I AGREE. WHAT DO WE KNOW IT WAS THE TREATMENT NOT JUST FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS IS MORE EFFECTIVE THE PERSON ACCEPTS IT WILL. BE FRUSTRATING FOR LOVED ONES AND OTHERS TO WATCH A FAMILY MEMBER IN NEED ASSISTANCE REFUSING TO TAKE-ADVANTAGE WILL BE ABLE SERVICES. THINK HOW FASTER IT IS FOR MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED AGAINST COVER NINETEEN THAT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO BE ACCIDENT. BUT IN A FREE SOCIETY THAT VALUES LIBERTY SHOULD BE LEERY OF FORCING PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT AGAINST THAT WELL RATHER WE NEED TO WORK HARDER TO MAKE THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE A HIGHER QUALITY. MORE AVAILABLE AND MORE ACCESSIBLETO THE PEOPLE WE SEEK TO SIR SO THE QUESTION. BECOMES LESS MISTER. BACKGROUND OF COURSE- WE ARE DEALING WITH. INSURANCE THAT REALLY HAS BEEN A- OVER THE- ALMOST SEVENTY. I WOULD SAY THAT SIXTIES YEARS. I'M BEGINNING IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WAS THE HIGH POINT OF. INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE IN PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. AND THE COMBINATION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN THAT YEAR- JOHN F. KENNEDY'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. ABOUT A BOLD NEW APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. JUMPSTARTED AN APPROACH. THAT TALKED ABOUT THE VALUE AND- REFERENCE UP TO BE BASED. ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE SAID. EARLY EFFORTS TO CLEAN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ACT- WE'RE- PROMISED MORE THAN THEY WERE ABLE TO DELIVER SOMETHING CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH. DO YOU. ARE WHICH GAO AND NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. AS BOTH GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF INSTITUTIONS AND GETTING AND KEEPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING IN THERE. IN FIRST PLACE HOSPITALS AT THE SAME TIME IS COMMUNITY BASED CARE. HOW SERVICE IS SUPPORTED HOUSING SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT YOUR SUPPORT AND OTHERS HAS PROLIFERATED. BUT IT'S JUST A RESOURCES FROM THE INSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN HAS NOT RESULTED IN ADEQUATE FUNDING OF COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES THE SAME TIME STARTING IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES ADVOCATES BEGAN TO FOCUS ON THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR COMBAT. ALLEGEDLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO CONCRETE INSTITUTIONS IN A SERIES OF CASES MOST OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT. ADVOCATES SUCCESSFULLY CHARM CIVIL COMMITMENT STATUTES THE PERMITTED COMMITMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGEDLY MENTALLY ILL PERSONS NEED FOR CARE AND TREATMENT. DIDN'T MATTER SUCH CARE WAS INADEQUATE AND THE TREATMENT LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT BUT THIS LOW BARS OF THAT AND MANY PEOPLE BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED WHO DID NOT NEED TO BE. IN THIS AND OTHER PERIODS THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OLDER PERSONS. ALL RIGHT NO BUSINESS BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED IN STATE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. WHERE HOUSING WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. THE NEW STEP THAT THE ALLEGEDLY MENTALLY ILL PERSON NEEDED TO BE CHANGED TO SUFFER OTHERS GOT A SUBSTANTIAL BOOST FROM THE U. S. SUPREME COURT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE DECISION OF ALL. KIND OF RESPONSE. WHICH I THE STATE COULD NOT COME TO THIS TO. UNDER PERSON TO SURVIVE THE COMMUNITY WITH THE HELP OF FAMILY FRIENDS. THAT'S GOOD TO DODSON STATES TO THE STANDARDS STAND. STANDARD ADDING ANOTHER PRO OF JUST WHICH COUNTY. ALTHOUGH JUST OF THIS LAST PHRASE OF THE AND VERY THEY KEEP ASPECT THE TO READ TO BE WHO MIGHT NOT BE FOR DAY TO SELL PARK. BUT AT RISK OF SIX HARM TO THEM SO BECAUSE OF AN TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR BASIC CARE. IS REVISED STATUTES SOME PROCEEDING DONALDSON AND OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT ALSO CORPORATE AT THE CONCEPT AS WE HEARD AT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE. THAT IS BECAUSE COMMITMENT TO INSTITUTIONAL BONTA MASSIVELY TRAVEL OF LIBERTY STATE HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE METHODS OF TREATMENT. PAGE LESS ON A PERSON'S LIBERTY OR AUTONOMY SPRING COURT ALSO HELD IN A CASE CALLED ANGELES TEXAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THAT THE STATE MUST DEMONSTRATE BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION MAKES THE COMMITMENT STANDARD I NEED TO MAKE A STAND. OTHER FORMS SUCH AS TIME LIMITED COMMITMENTS PERIODIC REVIEW MORE ROBUST DEFINITIONS OF DANGEROUSNESS WHICH FOCUSED ON IMMINENT DANGER MISSION OVER ACTS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING DANGERS. ALSO CAME INTO PLAY. THESE DEVELOPMENTS PERCENT THE IN THE OF STATUTE SUCH AS THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ITS TO. FOR ACT. G. EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT I DO AS THE SPREE COURT A EIGHT JUST IN NINETY NINE POSTED FIRST L. C. WHICH FOUND THAT. WAS A FORMER DISCRIMINATION AND REQUIRE THIS TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BE PROVIDED AT LEAST IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING IS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ABOUT OF COURSE IS BEEN THE CONCEPT OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT LTT WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE A CALIFORNIA FOR LAWRENCE LAW. STATE SECTIONS VERY REGARDING THE STANDARDS THAT IN SOME STATES SUCH AS NORTH CAROLINA FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING OUTPATIENT COMMITMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEMED MENTALLY ILL AND IN DANGER OF SEVERE TO GENERATION. EVEN IF THEY WOULD NOT BE A DANGEROUSNESS TO SUFFER EITHER STANDARD OR GREAT DISABILITY. CALIFORNIA'S BANNERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACTOR LPS WHICH WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS TREND. ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE COMMITMENTS TO ACTIONS TO CORPORATE DANGEROUSNESS AND GREAT DISABILITY INTO ITS COMMITMENT STANDARD. I THANK THE LPS ACT ACCORDING TO SAM'S FEDERAL LEVEL SERVICE A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES CONSIDERING REFORM OF COMMITMENT LOS. EFFORTS TO WATER DOWN THE COMMITMENT STANDARD OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPOSE TREATMENT AGAINST A PERSON'S WILL SHOULD BE RECESSED. YESTERDAY'S LA TIMES EDITORIAL DON'T TAKE SELF DETERMINATION FOR THE MENTALLY ILL THANKS NUMBER OF COACHING POINTS IN THIS REGARD. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE STATE AUDITOR CONCLUDED NOT LONG AGO THAT THE LPS ACT CRITERIA. WHERE APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE EXPANDED WHEN DOING SO WOULD ENDANGER CIVIL LIBERTIES. WITH THAT SAID ONE OF ALTERNATIVES TO ENHANCING ARE MAKING IT EASIER. GOAL AGAINST THEIR WILL WELL ONE VERY IMPORTANT ONE I WANT TO START WITH IS ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT CALLED ACTS UP AGAIN I SHOULD SAY IF YOU WORK IN THIS FIELD AT ALL SURE YOU'RE QUITE AWARE YOU HAVE TO DO NOTHING BUT IF YOU DID NOTHING BUT MEMORIZED ACRONYMS YOU WOULD BE. QUITE THIS ITEM THAT DID ACT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. COMORBIDITY WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE- ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT HIGH SPECIALIZED PERSONALIZED CARE TO THE CLIENT. OFFICIALS WITH BACKROADS. HERE PSYCHOLOGY DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY ITS MANAGEMENT ARE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES AND HERE I'M QUOTING FROM DUAL DIAGNOSIS DOT ORG WHICH IS PROVIDED THAT THAT DEFINITION. THE STUDY SHOWED EXCELLENT OUTCOMES WITH ACT- AND IN BOTH THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSED START DOT ORG OTHER SOURCES REPORT THIS AS A RESULT OF MAKING- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ACT. I ONE SEES THAT PEOPLE SPEND THREE DAYS IN JAIL- THE NUMBER OF INPATIENT HOSPITAL DAYS ARE REDUCED THE REDUCTION IN JAIL BOOKINGS AND ARRESTS AND REDUCTION ALCOHOL USE. MORE IMPORTANT OR AS IMPORTANT PATIENTS FEEL HAPPIER. AND ARE AT AND IT WAS SECURE LIVING CONDITIONS WERE LIKELY TO WORK WERE LIKELY TO TAKE MEDICATION HE AND MORE LIKELY TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY- AGAIN THIS CAN BE A PART OF THE- ASSISTED OPERATION TREATMENT BUT IT'S- DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S NOT COURSE IF YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED TO SUCH A PROGRAM. I IS SIMPLY ONE OF PROGRAMS IT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU THE REAL CHEAP PARTY I THINK IT IS INTERDISCIPLINARY ARTIST LEVEL SERVICES. AND COORDINATION AND AVAILABLE ALL THOSE. ARE REALLY CRITICAL ASPECTS. ELEMENT OF WHAT BE THE OF AS PROBABLY SET COMMITTEES SUPPORT IS THAT SUPPORT HOUSING. IT'S A HOUSING ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND RECEIVE SERVICES THERE. SHOULD SAY THAT THE THEORY OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION STARKLY GOING BACK INTO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. WAS THAT PEOPLE NEEDED TO SORT OF A RESPITE IF YOU WILL THE SILENCE TO GET OUT OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER TERM USED WAS THAT THAT MORAL TREATMENT- IT CLEARLY OR QUICKLY DID. AND FOUGHT FOR SENATE BILL EVOLVED INTO. A STUDY LOOKING AT BEST. BUT I THINK WE LEARNED IS AS EARLY AS THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES WAS IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ADJUST TO THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES. YOU NEED TO BE A NETWORK BECAUSE ADJUSTING TO AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING AB EVEN IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT MANY. PEOPLE THAT CHALLENGES AND- WE NOT NECESSARILY. AT GIVE ANY INDICATION I JUST TOOK HIM SOME THE DIFFERENCE OF NORMS DIFFERENT SENSE OF IT SAID ABSOLUTELY OF THAT ALLOWED TO LIVE IN THE OWN IS THE PLACE WHERE THEY WILL IF THEY'RE GONNA BETTER WERE YEAH. SERVICE AND SUPPORT HOUSING INCLUDING STEPS. EXTRA IN IN THE LIVING SO. MEDICATION MANAGEMENTSUBSTANCE JUST TREATMENT. HELP IS THE EMPLOYMENT AND MAINTAINING HOUSING HOME HEALTH IS. SO THERE MANY I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT AS THEY SAY IT TAKES A VILLAGE IN THE VILLAGE HERE ARE THE DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL. SUPPORTS THAT UP EVERY PROVIDE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE IS THAT OF- PROVIDING MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES WHICH AGAIN. IS NOT ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO INSTITUTIONAL CARE AT THE PSYCHIATRIC LEVEL BUT IMPORTANTLY CAN BE. MULTITUDE OF TWO POLICE AND CRIMINALS- A LOT PARLIAMENT. OKAY THAT'S RIDICULOUS YOU I THINK I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR PEOPLE WITH TOM YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET PEOPLE OF COLOR I MANY OF THEM WIND UP. GETTING INTO TROUBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY COULD BE TREATED THROUGH THE MOBILE TEAM. I RATHER THAN THREE BY POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT REALLY TRAINED RECALLING TO DEAL WITH THIS POPULATION APPROPRIATE WAY. IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS. SERVICE IS THAT IT BE PROVIDED BY A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ILLEGALITY. OF THAT INCLUDES A PEER SPECIALIST IF YOUR SUPPORT PERSON AS WE HEARD OF THE PREVIOUS. WITNESS HERE'S A CONFERENCE SITUATE COULD BE VERY THE NEED FOR OR AT SPLIT SPLIT GOING THROUGH SAY THAT. THEY'VE WITH EXTREMIST- AND- I'M NOT. AT IS ALSO AT MOBILE MOBILE SIR FOR OFF SLOW AND- AVAILABILITY OF WHAT IT CALLED- COMMUNITY CRISIS APARTMENTS SOMETHING YOU. TO BE IN THE COMMUNITY IF NOT IN THEIR OWN HOME- IN ORDER TO. BE PART OF THEIR GETTING GETTING BETTER PROCESS. AND MOBILE UNITS I THINK I'VE BEEN SHOWN IN STUDIES TO REDUCE INCARCERATION AND THE NEED TO CALL FIRST RESPOND. WELL IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR HASN'T TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TAKE CARE OF. YOU ALSO NEED YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND SO SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT IS ANOTHER ELEMENT. OF A ROBUST SYSTEM. ARE IT'S A PACKAGE OF SERVICES AIMED AT HELPING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. GETTING S. ALLOWING THEM TO GET AND KEEP A JOB IN THE IN THE WORK FORCE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TIME LIMITED. AND IS FOCUSED ON THE PERSON'S UNEMPLOYMENT DOES NOT GOALS THAT ARE. DETERMINED EXTERNALLY TO THE- ONE THAT ONE ASPECT OF SUPPORT EMPLOYMENTS COME SOMETHING CALLED INDIVIDUAL PLACEMENTS SUPPORTER I GUESS. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MODELS I'M SUPPORT ON IT. AND TO GO TO SOURCE IT USES A RAPID JOB SEARCH APPROACH TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ACHIEVE JOBS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE LENGTHY ASSESSMENTS. TRAINING CAMPS AND IS IT PUTS YOU INTO THE POSITION OF THE EMPLOYMENT POSITIONS WHAT I RATHER THAN THE KIND OF STEPS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO THROUGH. TO GET TO THAT. AND ONE SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT. I. P. S. AS SHOWN- HIGH THE TO OTHER P. WITH ILLNESS. JUST MARCH. I AM ALSO OVER INCREASE USED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. LASTLY I WANT TO MAKE. A PEER SUPPORT WHICH AGAIN WE WE'VE ABOUT- FROM- FIRST. I THESE ARE TRAINS. NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE BUT INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. THEY CAN HELP THE PERSON IN DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING. IN ESTABLISHING OR MAINTAINING SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AGAIN THIS IS JOE TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS. FOR ALL THESE. ARE ADEQUATE FUNDING AND SMART COORDINATION EXISTING FUNDING IS AMOUNTS. OVER TIME FUNDING MUST BE SPENT ON SUPPORTING PEOPLE IN NEED WITH APPROPRIATE SPORTS. WE PROBABLY SUPPORTS AND THAT WILL BE MONEY WELL SPENT BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AGAIN WE HEARD THE PRIOR SPEAKER SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS THAT COULD COME FROM. A MORE ROBUST. APPROACH IN THE PROGRAM. BUT ALSO REDUCING FUTURE COSTS AND IN FACT LET IT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GREATER OPPORTUNITY PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS FUTURE. NOT ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF THE KINDS OF ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. HE'S NOT TRYING TO SCUTTLE TORNADOES BUT ARE ONES THAT ARE SHOWING INCREASING PROMISE WITH A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH IN SUPPORT. AND PRACTICE SUPPORT. THE KEY IS COORDINATION AND PROVISION AND EXPANSION OF NON COURSE OF SERVICES FOR THE POPULATION. HERE AGAIN AB FIVE. THINKING ABOUT THE PRIOR SPEAKER NOT. AGREE WITH THIS. WE HAVE TO I THINK GET AWAY FROM THE SENSE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS BEING SOMEHOW WILDLY DISTINCT FROM DIVERGING FROM OTHER KINDS OF. SOCIAL SERVICES OR MEDICAL AND OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES THAT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU EXPERIENCE AS PART OF IT RATHER THAN THE KIND OF SEPARATION. AND WE HAVE TO I THINK IN THE END IF WE CAN'T GET THERE TODAY WE HAVE TO MOVE OVER TIME TO A SITUATION WHERE WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR. A COURSE OF SERVICES SO IT'S VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT REDUCTION IN SUCH. FORMS OF INTERVENTION INSTANCE GO STRAINS INCLUSION. OTHER ISOLATION OTHER KINDS OF WAYS- BECAUSE THOSE ARE CAN HAVE SHORT TERM SUCCESS BUT NOT LEAD TO LONG TERM SUCCESS. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING- RETCHING THE CRITERIA FOR CIVIL. MAKING IT EASIER. TO INVOLVE. CONFINED PEOPLE ON HOLD FOR LONGER TERM. BASIS IS NOT GOING TO IN THE AND STOP THE PROBLEM. EITHER AND NOR OF COURSE ISN'T AN APPROACH THAT WOULD RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF LIBERTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION AND FOR AGAIN FOR. REPORT IN WHICH- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR DENNISTON HOPE YOU CAN STICK AROUND WE'LL HAVE WE'RE GONNA ASK QUESTIONS SAID WE'RE DONE YEAH. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND NOW MISTER MISTER EWING WE- FOR A FAMILIAR FACE GOOD TO SEE YOU THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR PROJECT HAVE TO BE HERE AND THAT TO JEFF STONE AS WELL FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEES ON THIS TOPIC FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS TOBY DOING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE'S NOT HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEES ARE ARE UP DIRECTING TOWARDS THE CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA'S LPS STATUTES AND US AND THE SERVICES THAT SURROUND THEM AND YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY ALREADY AND I'M SURE THERE'S A QUEUE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF AND JUST TO REITERATE A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT THAT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY HERE BECAUSE I THINK THERE- THE RIGHT AREA FOCUS. YOU KNOW FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT THE STATE HAS FOCUSED CONSIDERABLE TIME AND ENERGY ON THE CONDITION AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE INVOLUNTARILY SERVE PEOPLE AND BUT WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY DEDICATED THE COMMENSURATE LEVEL OF TIME AND ATTENTION ON HOW THOSE SERVICES ARE WORKING AND SO YOU HEARD SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THIS MORNING AROUND DATA CHALLENGES. I'M YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMENTS FROM THAT THAT THE PEERS THE FOLKS OF LIVED EXPERIENCE. I HAVE HOSTED- PANELS. STATE LEVEL PANEL WITH. WHO SAID THAT HOSPITALIZATION INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION. WAS THE- THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF THEIR LIFE- BUT IT ALSO SAVE THEIR LIFE. AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN SO TRAUMATIC THAT THAT THEY WOULD NEVER ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE HOSPITALIZED UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS AGAIN AND SO CLEARLY WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE AND WHAT THE COP WHAT THAT REMOTE RESPONSE LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK DOCTORS ELDER LAID OUT. A MODEL THAT THE COMMISSION TOMORROW IN FACT IS DOING A SITE VISIT FOR THE PROGRAM DOWN IN LOS ANGELES AND WE'RE HOPING TO VISIT. THE SITE HERE IN TOWN- PROBABLY THE VERY BEGINNING OF JANUARY. SO YOU KNOW I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU KNOW FIRST WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS THAT EXPERIENCE OF INVOLUNTARY CARE AND HOW CAN WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND FROM THAT FROM THAT HUMAN CENTERED PERSPECTIVE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE QUALITY. AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT STANDARDS AND STRATEGIES IN PLACE THAT NGUYEN INVOLUNTARY CARE IS PROVIDED IT IS THE MOST. EFFECTIVE OUTCOME FOCUSED CARE POSSIBLE WE DO THAT IN OTHER AREAS OF HEALTH CARE ROUTINELY. AND WE HAVE NOT SPENT AS MUCH TIME AND ATTENTION ON ENSURING THAT THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT WE CAN DEPLOY IN ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE. THE GOVERNOR IN HIS HISTORIC CHILDREN NEED BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE HAD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING TO EXPLORE AND SCALE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE. WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO UNDERSTAND ARE THERE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND HOW MIGHT THE STATE INCENTIVIZE. THE ADOPTION OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF QUALITY AND OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH INVOLUNTARY CARE WHEN IT IS UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION. BUT AS AS OUTLINED. BY OTHERS- IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING RELIANCE ON INVOLUNTARY CARE IT NEEDS TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL INTERVENTION AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY. SO IN ADDITION TO REALLY ENGAGING PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD REDESIGN AND REINVENT HOW WE RESPOND WHEN PEOPLE ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. REALLY THINKING SYSTEMATICALLY ABOUT HOW CAN WE REDUCE THAT RELIANCE TO SET CLEAR GOALS COMPELLING GOALS FOR THE USE OF INVOLUNTARY CARE TO MAKE IT RARE BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE IT EXCLLENT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS MYSELF. WHO WHO HAVE NEEDED THAT LEVEL OF INTERVENTION AND HAVE CALLED INTO QUESTION THE ADEQUACY AND THE QUALITY OF THAT CARE SO IT NEEDS TO BE EXCELLENT. AND IT NEEDS TO BE EXCEPTIONAL AND RARE IN THAT IN THAT INSTANCE. THIS MEANS- AGGRESSIVELY FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN RESPOND MUCH EARLIER. TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. WHO ARE AT POTENTIAL RISK FOR NEEDING INVOLUNTARY CARE. WE HAVE SOME UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DESIGN OF OUR SYSTEM SO. THE AUDITOR IN HER PRESENTATION MENTION FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. THIS IS A CALIFORNIA INVENTION COMING OUT OF WORK DONE IN IN LONG BEACH. YEARS AGO AND THAT IDENTIFIED A- SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. TO SERVE THEM IN COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED IN THE HOSPITAL'S. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT HOMELESSNESS AND HOSPITALIZATION. UNDER THE STATE'S FUNDING RULES WE REQUIRE COUNTIES TO SPEND JUST UNDER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO SUPPORT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INVESTMENT IS HAVING THE IMPACT THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE. AND THAT CAN BECOME AN INTERVENTION THAT CAN REDUCE. THE NEED FOR INVOLUNTARY SERVICES OVER TIME. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THE WORK OF SENATOR EGGMAN WHO WAS HERE THIS MORNING SHE PASSED S. B. SHE AUTHORED SB. SIX FOUR SIX FIVE TO THE GOVERNOR SIGNED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO LOOKING MORE INTENSIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE- THAT LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO ENGAGE TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING TODAY. THAT'S ONE TO RECOGNIZE DR JOHN SHARON L. A. COUNTY HE ACTUALLY STARTED THAT WORK. REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP FOR HAVING IN LA. AND WITH SOME COMMISSION SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE EIGHT COUNTIES. TO REPLICATE THE KIND OF WORK THAT DR SHARON HAS DONE IN LA. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN GET BIG BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK. FOR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMMISSION IS DOING A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED A FEW YEARS AGO INCLUDING. TRYING TO EXPAND THE UTILIZATION OF PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES ADVANCE DIRECTIVES ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. THEY'RE NOT REGULARLY USED IN THE AREA OF PSYCHIATRY AND SAW THOUGH THEY'RE AUTHORIZED OR LEGALLY RECOGNIZED WE DON'T HAVE. STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND IMPLEMENTATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN DEPLOY PSYCHIATRIC VENTS DIRECTIVES WERE WORKING WITH ABOUT EIGHT COUNTIES. TO DEPLOY THIS STRATEGY AS A AS AN INNOVATION TO SEE IF THIS APPROACH ACTUALLY COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE. AND THE IDEA REALLY IS TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN CRISIS. TO DESTRESS AND ENGAGE SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE IN CRISIS WE HAVE A GAME PLAN THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE DEVELOPED. SO IT'S LESS ABOUT IMPOSING A MEDICAL INTERVENTION AGAINST SOMEONE'S WILL AT A TIME OF CRISIS INSTEAD WORKING WITH THEM WHEN THEY DON'T NEED THAT INTERVENTION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL WORK BEST. SIMILAR TO THE KIND OF LANGUAGE YOU SAW IN THE PRESENTATION FROM DOCTORS DOLLAR ABOUT ENGAGING FROM THIS VERY HUMAN CENTERED APPROACH. ANOTHER AREA WORTH CONSIDERING IS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA OF THE INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE BEING PUT INTO INVOLUNTARY. TREATMENT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ANTICIPATE THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF PSYCHOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH. THESE CONSUMERS WHO ARE FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT. THE STATE HAS MADE SOME INVESTMENTS IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS CARE BUT WE DO NOT YET HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO. AN EVIDENCE BASED EARLY RESPONSE TO PSYCHOSIS. RESEARCH OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUGGEST THAT EARLYINTERVENTIONS CAN HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH INDEPENDENT RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTIVE LIVES. IN REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON CRISIS CARE OVER TIME. BUT IT IS THE EXCEPTION IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTY PARTNERS TO REALLY EXPAND THAT. I MENTIONED THE SECOND TWO EVENTS DIRECTIVES WORKED EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK- THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING ON EMPATHIC. IS WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN BUILD UPON THE CAPACITY OF OUR COUTY PARTNERS. REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE ENGAGE THE VOICE OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS IDENTIFY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES OR EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OFTEN THE CASE. AND BEGIN TO SCALE THE STRATEGIES IN WAYS THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION STATEWIDE. I THINK- WE KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAP INTO THE EXPERTISE OF UC DAVIS UCSF STANFORD USC. OTHER ACADEMIC PARTNERS- ALL OF THIS REALLY STARTS WITH LISTENING TO THE CUSTOMER THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SERVE. CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY ACTIVE. AND EMPOWERED PEER MOVEMENT. AND CLEARLY AVAILABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK WE HAVE A VERY EMPOWERED IN VOCAL FAMILY MOVEMENT. VERY IMPORTANT TO REALLY ENGAGE BOTH PEERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND SAY WHAT WE TRYING TO GET DONE. AND THEN TO TRY TO DESIGN THESE SYSTEMS SO THAT ONCE WE IDENTIFY I'M A BEST PRACTICE IN A MODEL WE YOU CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A SCALE THEM. IN A IN A RELATIVELY EASY WAY PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. IS WE CAN DEVELOP EVIDENCE BASED OR EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS BUT SCALING THEM IS OFTEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE DESIGNED OUR SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD I WOULD SAY- AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE FOCUS REALLY SHOULD BE ON EXCELLENCE IN THE RESPONSE WHEN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY IS NEEDED. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT REALLY INVESTING IN STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE NEED TO USE THAT TOOL- SO IT IS IT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT MEANS AS YOU DISCUSSED BUILDING OUT THE DATA SYSTEMS BUILDING UP THE CAPACITY FOR THE STATE TO BERESPONSIBLE FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE TOWARDS THAT GOAL OVER TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO BE HERE TODAY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER EWING- MOVE TO OUR- OUR PANEL HERE ARE. MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MR. I HAVE A- THIS IS COME UP AND NATURALLY- ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SO FAR IT IS A BUT NOT TO COMING IN AND OUT BUT- IN TERMS OF- URGENCY THAT IF SOMEONE'S IN CRISIS AND ALL CRISIS. THE URGENCY OF- DEALING WITH IT RIGHT AWAY. CERTAINLY OTHERWISE IT ACTUALLY WILL EXACERBATE- IF UNTREATED IN AND BECOME. A FARM WORSE FOR THEM AS AN INDIVIDUAL FARMER COSTLY AS ON- THEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS I'VE I WENT TO THE LOCAL. COMMUNITY CLINICS THAT- OFFER MEDICAL SERVICES. AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT- IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO THE CLINIC FOR. SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ELEMENT OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THEY CANNOT. IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AT THE SAME TIME AND GET THAT MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT IS- BUT I IMAGINE A KNOWN. ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME CORRECT. YEAH AND I JUST WANT THAT UP TO NOT SOMETHING THAT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAVE HEARD. OF IT GOING TO OUR LOCAL CLINICS THAT THEY HAVE TODAY AND INSTEAD SEND THEM AWAY SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FORTY EIGHT HOURS SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHO KNOWS WHEN. AT SOME LATER DATE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL RIGHT DOWN THE HALL. AND SO I JUST MAY MAKE AS A COMIC ENERGY REITERATING THE NEED IN ALL SETTINGS TO HAVE THAT URGENCY OF CARE ESPECIALLY IF THE RESOURCES RIGHT THERE AND IF IT'S A MATTER OF. CALLED THINGS ARE PAID OR REIMBURSED ON HAVE YOU THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY MORE CONFIDENCE LEVEL BUT I APPRECIATE- AB THE PRESENTATION IN TERMS OF MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS GETTING TREATMENT. ALL RIGHT AWAY YOU POSSIBLE. IF I MISTER. A SO PART OF THAT ISSUE IS AROUND FEDERAL RULES ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT THAT PART OF THAT ISSUE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM REALLY ISN'T AN ON DEMAND KIND OF SYSTEM. RIGHT IF I WALK INTO IF I TRY TO SEE MY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND I HAVE A SORE KNEE AND THE GOAL IS THAT AN ANTIBIOTIC OR- PAIN MEDICATION THAT'S USUALLY AVAILABLE BEFORE THE AFTERNOON. IF THE ANSWER IS SOMETHING- THAT INVOLVES MENTAL HEALTH INVOLVEMENT IT'S A DIFFERENT PAYMENT SYSTEM IT'S A DIFFERENT STRATEGY CAN TAKE MONTHS. SO I THINK THE ISSUE OF TWO VISITS DURING A SINGLE DAY IS ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S MUCH MORE BROADER THAN THAT. AND PART OF IT IS THAT WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM. OFTEN OFTEN TO SORT OF EXCLUDE CERTAIN PEOPLE BASED ON WHO PAYS WHO'S YOUR INSURANCE- THIS THE STATE HAS INVESTED SOME FUNDING IN A USED DROP IN CENTER. THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE ALL COMERS. THAT STARTS WITH ITS ITS TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN WALK IN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT TO BE SEEN SAME DAY. AND THE LESSON THERE THE RESEARCH IN ITS ITS INTERNATIONAL IS THAT IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ACCESS CARE. YOU NEED O REMOVE AS MANY BARRIERS AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO. ARE FACING DISABILITIES OR CHALLENGES ARE WHO ARE STRIVING. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUSH MORE PEOPLE INTO UPSTREAM KINDA SERVICES. TO AVOID THE NEED. FOR THAT YOU KNOW CRISIS RESPONSE. THANK YOU SEE THAT WITH THE VA FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A NEWER FACILITY THAT WAS- THAT OPENED UP IN IN MY AREA WHERE IT'S A ONE STOP SHOP. FOR THEY HAVE WHATEVER YOUR NEEDS OVER THERE HOUSING PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH. YOU NAME IT THEY THEY DON'T. YOU'RE NOT ASKING. OF THE PERSON IN NEED TO GO THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS AND TO TRAVEL AROUND AND WAIT FOR A DAILY FOR FIVE DAYS AND- I THINK THIS ALSO SPEAKS TO THIS IS ALSO BEEN REITERATED BY. BY MANY INCLUDING HER COLLEAGUES OF MINE. THAT WE JUST TREATMENT HELP DIFFERENTLY- AND I FIGURED THAT THAT CREATES A- A TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SYSTEM MIND IF THERE WAS A COORDINATION AND A SENSE THAT- OF TREATING THEM. AS AS EQUAL ELEMENTS- AND PHYSICAL AILMENT VERSES A MENTAL HEALTH AILMENT- THAT YOU COULDN'T OF DONE THAT HOMES TO ALLOW FOR THE COORDINATION MORE EASILY TOO BECAUSE YOU JUST. REMOVE SOME OF THOSE. BOTH ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS BUT ALSO JUST THE MENTALITY OF IT AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY SEE. THE DIFFERENT. TYPES OF ISSUES THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE FACING RAMYA. THANK YOU- FIRST I WANT TO THANK PANEL WAS LOOKING. TO HEARING SOME SOLUTIONS AND IDEAS THAT- WE COULD WORK ON IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR AND WANTED TO. FIRST START WITH ONSITE VISIT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY- TOBY IF YOU WANT TO COORDINATE WITH Y OFFICE AND SEE IF I CAN HELP SHARE THAT. WITH SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES I'D LOVE FOR. US TO GO SEE FIRSTHAND WHAT'S CURRENT WHAT'S- IN A BETA AND WHAT'S WORKING. WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL JUST SHARE THAT I SAW FIRST HAND WHAT OCCURRED WITH TOMMY WHO'S ONE OF OUR PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST. AND TO THE ORIGIN FOR WHY WE AND CALIFORNIA HAVE REALLY LEANED INTO SUPPORTING. THOSE PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THAT I'D LOVE TO FIGURE OUT AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT IS PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS WHO ARE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD. BUT I SAW THAT ACTUALLY OUT ON A SITE VISIT SEEING FIRST HAND HEARING FROM PEOPLE. AND HOPE THAT THIS UPCOMING YEAR MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL WANT TO. PARTICIPATE IN THAT SITE PRESIDENCY IF THIS M. PATH IS. PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR US. BUT I DON'T WANT TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE I PUSHED HARD AS WELL ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS CARE. AS WE KNOW THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN US. THAT THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS HELP US AS A SYSTEM LONG TERM HELPING TO PREVENT. THE DOWNSTREAM CONTACT CONSEQUENCES AND REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS AS A STATE TO- HELP THOSE WHEN WE CAN HELP THEM THE MOST. SO BELIEVE THAT THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS CARE IS RIGHT FOR US AS A STATE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. CALIFORNIA'S SHIP WE CAN. THANK IT WILL REACH TO YOU ON THE SIDE WITH AS WELL AS THE OF THE OTHER SIDE. WHERE PRESENTED THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- THAN TO CLOSEST CLOSEST PANEL OUT HERE PERSONAL- PERSONAL VERY INTERESTING PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE LEARNING ABOUT AND PASSED WITH. WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT YOUR YOUR EXPLANATION OF AND ILLUSTRATIONS PHOTOGRAPHS- KINDA HELP TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON THAT ON THAT FOR US AND SO I GUESS. OBVIOUSLY THE FAIRLY NEW YOU'RE YOU YOU CITED SOME SOME STUDIES THAT ARE OR SOME SOME RESULTS THAT ARE COMING OUT- WHICH WHICH SHOW SHOW TREMENDOUS PROMISE- IN GENERAL HOW ARE THESE FUNDED. HAVE HOW ARE IN PASS FUNDED- IS ARE THEY ASSUME THEIR DESIGNATED FACILITIES BY THE COUNTY OR OR I SHOULD ASSME ANYTHING BUT HOW HOW. GOOD BECAUSE WE ARE YOUR TOES BUT WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET PERMISSION OF THE COUNTY SO THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THERE SO IN GENERAL HOW ARE THEY HOW ARE THEY FUNDED. WHAT DO YOU TO THE AMAZING THING ABOUT HIM HAS BEEN THAT THE HOSPITALS HAVE. KIND OF TAKEN IT ON TO CREATE THEM THEMSELVES AND HAVEN'T SEEN STOCK. GRANT FUNDING OR WHAT HAVE YOU THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE GOTTEN. SB EIGHTY TWO FUNDS- THE- THE ONE THAT'S IN CARMICHAEL HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WAS ABLE TO. ACCESS SOME OF THAT. BUT EVEN ALSO SOME HAVE BEEN. DOING IT THROUGH PHILANTHROPY THERE'S AN ENORMOUS INTEREST IN THE FLAT FOR. PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY IN SUPPORTING THESE BECAUSE THERE'S- EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S A NATION WIDE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS GOINGON. IT'S A REALLY GOOD INVESTMENT WHERE MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT. HAVE TO DONATE TO GET YOUR NAME ON SOMETHING. ELSE WHERE YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE- AND AS I SAID YOU IS SOMETIMES THESE HOSPITALS HAVE UNDER UTILIZED. LARGE EMPTY ROOM THAT THEY CAN JUST. FIX UP AND MAKE INTO AN IMPACT UNIT THAT'S DOWN THE HALL FROM. FROM THEIR ER AND SUDDENLY. YOU KNOW. A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS LATER YOU'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF THE REIMBURSEMENT- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT THAT MEDICARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE WILL ACTUALLY. REIMBURSE THIS UNDER A RUBRIC OF. EMERGENCY OBSERVATION CARE WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME THING AS IF YOU WERE IN THERE FOR. A SMALL BALL OF STRUCTURE IN OR UNDER CHILUBA TREE FOR A HEART ATTACK. THEY IT WILL REIMBURSE AND THAT BOTH UNDER PRIVATE INSURANCE AND MEDICARE AND MANY OTHER STATES MEDICAID WILL PAY FOR IT THAT WAY. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE OBSERVATION CARE UNDER MEDICAID. SO INSTEAD THE COUNTY- MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT THEN HAS TO REIMBURSE UNDER CRISIS STABILIZATION. FUNDING WHICH USUALLY IS USED- THOUGHT OF IS FOR COMMUNITY BASED. CRISIS STABILIZATION PROGRAMS. IT'S THE SAME REIMBURSEMENT STRATEGY- THAT'S USE THAN FOR THE MEDIC HAL IN THE HOSPITAL- IMPACT UNITS- BUT IT NEEDS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THEY NEED TO BE A CONTRACT AND THEN THEY WILL ONLY REIMBURSE FOR THE- MENTAL HEALTH- PATIENTS WHO HAVE MEDICAID MEDIC CAL FOR THAT SPECIFIC COUNTY. THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET ONE WITH ALL OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES AS WELL IF THEY'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTIES. SO DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND IT ALSO PUTS THEM KIND OF AT. THE MERCY OF EACH COUNTY- IF THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE AS OPPOSED TO. ANY OTHER SERVICE THAT THAT HOSPITAL ER IS PROVIDING. THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNTY TO GET AN OK TO DO SO I GUESS SOME. OF I'M SITTING HERE THINKING- THIS. SO MANY ENTITIES- REIMBURSEMENT AS A FOR SERVICES AS A BIG COMPONENT OBVIOUSLY OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PEOPLE SO I JUST I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF M. PASSED SLOW DOWN BY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURSED SO- THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IS SHOWING GREAT PROMISE. WEST DOLLARS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A MUCH BETTER IMPACT. AND OUTCOME FOR THE PATIENT NOW. OUR SYSTEM START ARE ARE ALWAYS SET UP TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO SAY. DANGER ROGERS YOU KNOW SO I THINK WHAT THE HECK YOU KNOW. YOU WERE GOING TO PAY LESS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A BETTER OUTCOME- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. SO SO I I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS- AND I AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE AN EXPERT ON THIS BUT THIS IS FEELS LIKE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR- A WAIVER- IN INNOVATION WAIVER SOMETHING WITH THE FEDS TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN RESOURCES TO EXPAND UPON THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM THINKING IN CALIFORNIA- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT BUT- BUT- I DID- BUT- YOU KNOW. THIS ISN'T JUST HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA THESE IMPACT UNITS YOU SHOW TO OTHERS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT THAT OR MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IN CLEARLY. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HOSPITAL ER'S ISN'T. IS IT WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOT GETTING THE DESIRED RESULTS SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I'M HOW DID YOU WANT TO A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ONLY OR ARE THERE STATES. THAT DO PAY FOR OBSERVATION YEAH SO OBSERVATION IS AGNOSTIC TO DIAGNOSIS AS I SAID IT'S WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC IT'S ALL OF RUMORED AND SHE CARE. THINK THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FIVE STATES WHICH MEDICAID PAYS OBSERVATION EMERGENCY CARE BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT. THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE A FISCAL ARGUMENT FOR WHY IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT AND WOULD LOVE DETAILS IF YOU CAN. LOVE TO TALK TO MORE ABOUT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU DR ABELA- MR DINNER STEEN- GIVEN EXISTING CASE LAW- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CHANGE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW IN A WAY THAT WILL IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD A PERSON. WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO RECEIVE THE MENTAL OR- PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE THEY NEED WITHOUT. LIMITING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND IF SO HOW WOULD WE ACCOMPLISH THAT. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU- WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY I WANT TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING THAT THE DOCTOR YOU IN TESTIFIED BACK AS WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IN OUR DISABILITY RIGHTS CLINIC HERE IN WASHINGTON AND THAT IS. THE USE OF ADVANCED A DIRECTOR FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE- AND AB WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL PROTECTION ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DISABILITY RIGHTS DO YOU SEEN EACH YEAR WITH THE PROJECT WE GO SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER IN COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS OR ARE ABOUT TO BE. DISCHARGED FROM OUT AND WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT AND THEY EXPRESSED SOME INTEREST IN- EXECUTING AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE WHICH BOTH CAN INDICATE. WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES THEY WANT IF THEY COME TO A POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ARTICULATE BETTER COMMUNICATE THAT AT A LATER TIME WHEN I KEY EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS AND ALSO WHO MIGHT BE A PERSON THEY TRUST YOU CAN MAKE SOME SOME JUDGMENTS BECAUSE I DO THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HERE. IS WHAT LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT OF YOUR OF YOUR INTEREST LET'S SAY ARE YOU ABLE TO ENGAGE AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS CHALLENGE. SO THAT IS A WAY TO BASICALLY IN AT A TIME WHEN YOU'RE FEELING PRETTY GOOD AND ABLE TO MAKE THESE KIND OF CHOICES TO SORT OF. PROTECT YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I GET TO A POINT WHERE I CAN'T NOW THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT WHETHER THAT THAT TRIGGERS. THE DOCTORS OTHERWISE HAVE TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD DIRECTED BUT IT CAN LEAST AT MINIMUM INDICATE WHAT THE PREFERENCES AND I GUESS STEP YOU KNOW ANOTHER YOUR QUESTION I THINK IS SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR LAW TO ADDRESS MANY IS THE CONTINUING STIGMA THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND WITH THE TREATMENT OF. THE WAY WHICH I THINK ON THE PANEL. ABOUT THE- HISTORICAL THAT'S A OF THE SEARCH. ARE STEP OR DID. WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW PRETTY REASON WHY OUT HOW TO BE THE CASE. SO I MEAN LAW DON'T USE THE TERM KNOW FIRST NO HARM DR BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE FOR US. TO HAVE AS WELL SO THAT IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT STATUTES CAN AND CANNOT DO- I THINK THAT TO SOME EXTENT WE HAVE TO I. BELIEVE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY. FROM THAT KIND OF TENDENCY TO JUST. MAKE IT- WELL. HE IS A YEAR OR TWO TO DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM IS ONE WHERE THE PROBLEMS WERE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT PEOPLE FOR LONGER TERMS. SO WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO DO THAT AND I WAS. ENCOURAGED BY YOU KNOW BY THE- L. PANEL MEMBERS I THINK EVERYBODY. MR THIS PANEL WAS KIND OF THE SAME MIND WHICH IS. NOT NO WE DON'T WANT TO GET AWAY FROM COURSE OF TREATMENT WANT TO GET AWAY FROM LONG TERM TREATMENT. WE WANT TO TURN PEOPLE AROUND AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO I THINK LAW HAS TO. BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND I WILL SAY THAT OVER TIME LOOKING AT THIS. AND CALIFORNIA BUT MORE GENERALLY. TOO OFTEN WE'VE HAD POLICIES THAT WORK ACROSS PURPOSES WE HAVE. FUNDING STATUTES WHICH WILL IN ONE DIRECTION INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL. PROTECTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE BUT- LAST THING I GUESS I'LL SAY IS. I THINK YOU YOU. HAVE HEARD WILL HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED. LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN PUBLIC POLICY- YOU CAN SIT IN YOUR IVORY TOWER TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT. THE RIGHT INTEREST MIGHT BE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED. WHAT WOULD THEY FIND TO BE. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THEM. RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO BE FORCED TO AND THAT'S- NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUALS BUT FAMILY MEMBERS. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT HAVE A- WHAT PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN JUST A FINAL QUESTION ON THAT SAID TO MISTER EWING- IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU SPEND A GREAT DEAL IF YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL LIFE ADVOCATING FOR MORE INTEGRATED- COHESIVE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS- SO. SOMEBODY GIVE YOU AN EASY QUESTION- CAREFUL IN THE IN THE LPS ARENA HOW HE MAKES SUCCESS EASIER AND FAILURE MORE DIFFICULT. VISIT THE EASY QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR IT- YOU KNOW OUR OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS DESIGNED AROUND SORT OF YOU KNOW WE SET RULES ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN PAY FOR RIGHT AND THERE'S WE ALSO HAVE RULES ABOUT WHAT MUST BE PAID FOR SO THE EXAMPLE OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS RIGHT EVEN WITHIN THE REALIGNMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH COUNTIES. AND THEN AS SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THEN THERE'S THINGS THAT THE STATE JUST PAYS FOR. IS THE REASON THIS IS HARD IS. A VARIETY OF THINGS ONE WE DON'T HAVE CLEAR MODELS. AND SO THERE'S WIDE VARIATION ACROSS COUNTIES AND SO YOU THAT YOU'RE SEEING SOME EXAMPLES HERE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING AROUND PSYCHIATRIC EVENTS DIRECTORS IN WASHINGTON YOU IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHAT WHAT COUNTIES OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH WHAT THEY SHARE WITH US. IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT A BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTING IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT THERE OFTEN SORT OF ON THEIR OWN TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THAT AND THAT CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT WHEN IT'S YOUR DISTRICT AND IT'S TAILORED TO. A RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM LOS ANGELES OR- IN YOU KNOW OR IMPERIAL COUNTY. BUT IT ALSO CAN MEAN- THAT THEY'LL STRUGGLE TO S. C. THEIR SYSTEMS EVOLVE IN WAYS THAT RESULT IN. HAD THE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT CARE THAT LEADS TO THE RIGHT KINDS OF OUTCOMES. SO IF YOU KNOW THE STATE IS IN A POSITION PARTICULARLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS AND OTHERS. TO REALLY IDENTIFY WITH THESE MODELS ARE AND TO INCENTIVIZE AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY EXAMPLE IS ACTUALLY FINE WITH IMAGE THE INNOVATION FUNDS. IN THE QUESTIONS EXPLORING THE IDEA OF USING SOME OF OUR SB EIGHTY TO TRIAGE FUNDS TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES. TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITY HOSPITAL PARTNERS. TO ADOPT SOME OF THE SAMPATH MODELS SO. YOU KNOW IT IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IT FROM A KNOWLEDGE BASIS PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING THAT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE BASIS THAT'S SPECIALLY FOR SMALLER COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO GO LOOKING AND LEARNING FROM. AS FAR AWAY AS DC AROUND THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE DEPLOYED OR EVEN OUT OF STATE. SO IDENTIFYING MODELS DEVELOPING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING CREATING CLEAR FINANCING PATHS. IF THIS ISN'T AS EASY TO FIND IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE EASY TO IMPLEMENT OF IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND. IT IS GOING TO BE A HEAVIER LEFT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TYPICALLY ONLY THE MOST ARDENT CHAMPIONS. CLIMB UP THAT THE FINANCIAL HILDA FIGURE OUT HOW-TO IMPLEMENT. THEM THAT IS WORKING AGAINST STREAM. IT IN THE SAME THING IS TRUE AROUND STAFFING IF THERE'S CLEAR STAFFING STRATEGIES PARTICULARLY AROUND GUIDANCE TO IT TO FIDELITY TO THESE MODELS SUCH AS THE ROLE APPEARS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. AND LAST THING I WOULD SAY. DOING THE DATE IN THE ANALYTICS SO THAT THE POLICY. POLITICAL AND COMMUNITY INCENTIVES. TRY ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO ACTUALLY GET BETTER AT THIS OVER TIME SO IF SOME COMMUNITIES ARE ADOPTING PROGRAMS WHERE THEY'RE SEEING. THEIR INVOLUNTARY RATES GO DOWN ANOTHER COMMUNITIES ARE NOT HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING DOWN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGIES ARE. AND HOW DO WE CREATE THAT SUPPORT AT HOME. SO THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU FOR THE EASY QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR- MUCH APPRECIATED SO- I WOULD JUST I GUESS IT WAS CLOSE BY SAYING. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. HERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD BE- MAKE THINGS EASIER WOULD BE A RELIABLE CONTINUOUS BUT- THE BEST SHOT THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING THE UPDATE HERE ON THIS FABULOUS THAT IS YOUR MOTHER WILL TRANSFORM. RIGHT I'M SORRY THIS TRANSFORMATIVE THANKS- HOWEVER- FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE LONG TERM I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED CONTINUOUS FUNDING FOR A LOT OF A LOT OF PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD- THE INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT MATTER HERE TODAY IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER- YEAH I KNOW THERE'S OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO BEEN HERE TODAY I THINK SHOULD BE SHOULD BE. SHOULD BE NOTICED- WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE HEAR ABOUT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS EVERYWHERE I GO IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO- AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE THE SAME HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VOTE I THANK YOU OUT THERE FROM WASHINGTON DC MISTER DYNASTY DISTINCT THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO AN EXTENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE- ANOTHER ANOTHER ONE OF OUR HOPEFULLY- HOPEFULLY RAPID FIRE- WHEN WE CALL THEM- BOB RAPID FIRE SESSION HERE WE HAVE GOT FOUR PANELISTS AND WE'D LOVE TO GET ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EACH. SO- AND SHE'S TIMING YOU HERE SO JUST BECAUSE- BUT TO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT- IT LOOKS LIKE- WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THREE OF OUR PART THREE OF OUR PANELISTS IN PERSON THANK YOU THAT'S WONDERFUL- CERTAINLY WITH MR HAWTHORNE- WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALEX HAWTHORN WITH CALIFORNIA'S BILL SITUATION AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. ADDRESSING OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR CJR HOSPITALS. TO THAT END WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE PARTNERED WITH NAVY CALIFORNIA AND MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY. TO FORM THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACTION COALITION OR PJ FOR SHORT. THIS SET REPRESENTS OVER FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS WITH A SHARED GOAL TO ENGAGE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS TO PRIORITIZE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND RIVER STIGMAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANY FORMS OF THIS DISEASE. AND MAY OF THIS YEAR THE B. H. A. COALITION RELEASED A BLUEPRINT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHICH CALLS TO PRIORITIZE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. THE FULL DETAILS OF THIS PLAN CAN BE FOUND ON THE BEACH A WEBSITE AND WE HAVE SHARED THESE MATERIALS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. TODAY HOSPITALS PROVIDE CRISIS CARE THROUGH INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. BUT THIS IS A SAFETY NET SYSTEM AND THESE ARE NOT OPTIMAL SETTINGS FOR PATIENTS EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CONDITIONS. TO RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. RATHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVEST IN PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES IN EVERY COMMUNITY SO THE CALIFORNIANS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. CAN AVOID UNNECESSARY ACUTE CARE HOSPITALIZATION INCARCERATION AND CONSERVATORSHIP IS. THE BLUEPRINT IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC CRISIS STABILIZATION COMMUNITY BASED RESIDENTIAL CARE AND MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES THAT CAN DIVERT INDIVIDUALS FROM AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ENSURE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH SO CRITICAL THESE ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. THE BLUEPRINT CALLS ON INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE EXPANDED EXPANDED BY BOTH GOVERNMENT FUNDED PROGRAMS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS IT SADLY DO NOT TYPICALLY COVER THE SERVICES TODAY. SPECIFIC TO THE LPS ACT HOWEVER AND ALTHOUGH THE INTENTION OF THE LAW REMAINS SOUND IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE. FIRST UNDER THE OPS ACT PUBLIC CONSERVATIVES BECOME LGAL DECISION MAKERS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN BASIC NEEDS. WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOVED ONE WHO COULD DO SO FOR THEM. AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY COUNTY PUBLIC CONSERVATIVES ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED SOLELY WITH LOCAL FUNDS- WE SUPPORT THE COUNTY'S REQUEST FOR STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THIS REALLY CRITICAL SERVICE STEMMING FROM THE LPS ACT. SECOND AND WE DISCUSSED THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER DEDICATED STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP ON LPS ACT- INVOLUNTARY DETENTION AND TREATMENT IS ALSO NEEDED TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN APPLICATION OF THE LAW. TO ATTRACT DATA WE HEARD SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH THAT TODAY PROCESS TO RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AND ADVISE AND EDUCATE FAMILIES. INDIVIDUALS DETAINED OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE COURTS. SO SPECIFICALLY THIS LEADERSHIP COULD DO SOME OF THE FOLLOWING. FIRST ENABLE REVIEW OF EXISTING DOJ DATA AND REFORM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT POLICY MAKERS CAN ACCURATELY EVALUATE LPS TRANSALPINE AND THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTING RESOURCES. AS AN EXAMPLE THE AUDIT FOUND THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT CONNECTED TO ADEQUATE SERVICES FOLLOWING LPS HOLD. A STATE ENTITY COULD CLARIFY THE EXPECTATIONS FOR FOLLOW UP CARE AND IDENTIFY WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE PLACE ON INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. SECOND IT COULD PROMULGATE REGULATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTIVES. TO CLARIFY AREAS WHERE THE L. P. S. ACT IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. FOR EXAMPLE A STATE ENTITY COULD HELP CLARIFY WHEN THE CLOCK ON LPS HOLD BEGINS. THIRD IT COULD SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND DEVELOP TRAINING FOR THE COURTS LAW ENFORCEMENT PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS INVOLVED IN LPS ACT IMPLEMENTATION FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. AND FINALLY IT COULD ENSURE THE INVOLVEMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS IN OVERSIGHT AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE LPS ACT. FINALLY SEE TWO SUPPORTS MODERNIZING THE OPS ACT THROUGH LEGISLATION WHICH WILL REQUIRE CHANGES TO STANDARDIZE AND IMPROVE THE EVER EVOLVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE MUST STREAMLINE THE EVALUATION ASSESSMENTS AND RELEASE PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS DETAINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BROUGHT TO HOSPITALS ON AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. WE MUST BETTER DEFINE THE VARIOUS STEPS OF THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY DETENTION PROCESS CLEARLY ARTICULATE WANNA HOLD BEGINS IN SOURIS DISCONTINUED I WHO MAY PERFORM THESE DECISION MAKING FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE CONSISTENT STATEWIDE APPLICATION SO THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CARE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THERE'S CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR LPS LAWS AND A ROBUST CONTINUUM OF OUTPATIENT CRISIS SERVICES EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE WE CAN BETTER ACHIEVE THE L. P. S. ACTS GOALS. THE PROVIDING PROMPT TREATMENT AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHILE ENSURING CIVIL LIBERTY PROTECTIONS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH NEXT IS THE MICHELLE CABRERA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COUNT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE- CHAIR WOULD CHAIR STONE AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE COVERED IT UP AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND TODAY WE HEARD FROM AN ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO EACH WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE LAID OUT AN ARRAY OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE. OF OUR LPS SYSTEM. OUR MEMBERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY AFFIRMED WHAT MANY TODAY HAVE SPOKEN TO. OUR BEST CHANCE AT HEALING COMES THROUGH VOLUNTARY ENGAGEMENT INTO SERVICES. AND THESE APPROACHES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL. CONSISTENT WITH THE OLMSTED ACT AND TIED TO IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES. WHEN WE ASKED OUR MEMBERS WHAT CHANGES WERE NEEDED THEY WERE CLEAR WE DON'T NEED MORE STICKS WE NEED MORE CARROTS. SO THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER TODAY IS THIS WE NEED TO RIGHT SIZE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET FUNDING. IN RECESSION YEARS REALIGNMENT SERVED AS A BUFFER TO PROTECT THESE FUNDING FOR CRUCIAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. BUT TODAY WE'RE STUCK IN THAT BASEMENT THE DOCTOR KELLY REFERENCED EARLIER. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN REALIGNMENT WAS NEGOTIATED CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HAS GROWN BY THIRTY FOUR POINT 5% OR TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND OUR FUNDING HAS REMAINED STEADY BUT STOPPED. IT WAS NEVER TIED TO CASELOAD. IT WAS TIED TO A CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH THAT UNLIKE THE LAND TERMAN ACT FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHICH IS AN ENTITLEMENT WAS A DOT DOT DOT TO THE EXTENT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. IT STARTED OUT AS A NICE TO HAVE NOT A MUST HAVE. AND WHILE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S PURSUIT OF AN I AM THE WAIVER FOR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE. WE NEED FUNDING TO PAY FOR THE ONGOING SERVICES AND SALARIES IN THIS COMPETITIVE JOB MARKET. WE WILL NEED TO KEEP THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY GOING FOR THIRTY YEARS OR BEYOND. WE GOT A CAR WITH NO GAS MEANS IMPROVED FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TREATMENT BUT ALSO FOR THE EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS- SORRY MEDIC HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WE COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TURNING THE TIDE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PRESENTED TO US IN INCREASED FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS METHAMPHETAMINE RELATED PSYCHOSIS AND ALARMING LEVELS OF ALCOHOL ABUSE FUELED IN THIS PANDEMIC. NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE HOUSING FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS IF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS CAN BE PRIORITIZE WITH OUR HOUSING EFFORTS WE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR MEANING THAT WHEN WE PROVIDE A SAFE STABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WE INTERRUPT CYCLES OF CRIMINALIZATION AND THE SEVERE DETERIORATION OF PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE START TO CALL FOR RECOVERY RATHER THAN FAILURE. DR KELLY SPOKE IN THE MORNING ABOUT A FEW OF OUR HOUSING RELATED CHALLENGES BUT WE ALSO HAVE CONCRETE SOLUTIONS TO PROPOSE. FIRST WELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY FOR HOUSING IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT PULLS FUNDING AWAY FROM SERVICES. IN THE IMMEDIATE WE PROPOSE THE STATE COMMITTED TO FUNDING HOUSING FOR ANY AND ALL FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP OR LPS CLIENTS AND THAT ANY CLIENT ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN TREATMENT. IN THIS WAY SHOULD BE GUARANTEED HOUSING. WE SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THOSE RESOURCES. WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS- WITH A BROADER- STATE LEVEL HOUSING INVESTMENT SO. THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS ONE USEFUL APPROACH HOWEVER OUR CLIENTS- OFTENTIMES HAVE WIDER NEEDS AND THEY NEED A WIDER ARRAY OF HOUSING OPTIONS INCLUDING. RATES FOR BOARDING CARE FACILITIES AGAIN NOT JUST THE BRICKS AND MORTAR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OFTEN FEDERAL DEFINITIONS OF HOMELESS EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION OR FROM RESIDENTIAL OR INPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES DESPITE THEIR VULNERABILITY. WE NEED TO TIP THE SCALE WITH STATE POLICY AND INVESTMENTS THAT FOCUS ON OUR MOST IMPORTANT SUBSET WITHIN THE BROADER BROADER POPULATIONS. WITH EXPANDING SERVICES FOR FUNDING PARTICULARLY NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT S. U. D. FUNDING AND HOUSING WE CAN ALTER THE COURSE OF THIS CRISIS. BECAUSE BUILDING OUR WORKFORCE SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING HOUSING WILL TAKE TIME WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERING EXPANSION OF OUR PEER MEDICAL BENEFIT FROM AN OPTIONAL BENEFIT WHICH MUCH MUST BE TODAY ENTIRELY COUNTY FUNDED WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. TO A ROBUST FULLY FUNDED STATE MEDICAL BENEFIT WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER BENEFIT FOR MANAGED CARE THE OPTIONAL AND UNFUNDED NATURE OF PEERS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CREATES A LACK OF EQUITY. AND IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO FULLY COMMIT TO PIERCE. FINALLY IT IS ALSO TIME THAT WE INVEST IN BUILDING OUR STATE'S MORAL CRISIS SYSTEM WITH INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISPATCH PAYMENT IN COORDINATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH CRISIS MEANS. THIS TOO IS A MATTER OF POLICY AND PARITY WE MUST FULLY FUND WE I'M SORRY WE ALREADY FULLY FUND MEDICAL EMERGENCY IN CRISIS. BUT WE NEED TO DO THAT AS WELL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT ALTERNATIVES TO NINE ONE ONE AND POLICE. REGARDING OUR% PUBLIC GUARDIANS WE SUPPORT IMPROVE STATE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC GUARDIAN SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY RESOURCE THAT AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY. AND FINALLY WE URGE YOU TO MOVE BEYOND PARITY TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH COMMERCIAL COVERAGE CAN GET SPECIALTY CARE AND HELP COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ALL TOO OFTEN IS SHOULDERING THE RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS THE BLAME FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO BECOME DISABLED BY VIRTUE OF THEIR- UNTREATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND PHYSICAL CONDITIONS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ISSUES AND CONCERNS CANNOT BE ADDRESSED BY OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NET. ALONE ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE WELCOME INCREASE STATE LEVEL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SERVICES I WANT TO THANK DR ADAM LAFFER OFFERING AND CARRYING AB SIX EIGHTY SIX. WHICH WE INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND WHICH WOULD LET- BUILD UPON SUCCESSFUL OVERSIGHT STRUCTURES AND CAL WORKS IN CHILD WELFARE. TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE OUR MEMBERS WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SERVICES FOR OUTCOMES FOR FUNDING. AND WE INCLUDED EQUITY AND DISPARITIES IN THIS BILL. OUR FOLKS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD STORY TO TELL AT THE STATE ACTUALLY. THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND THEN WE HAVE AB EIGHT SIX EIGHTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BREWING X. HU H. WITH IS OFTEN THIS COMMITTEE AND SEEKS TO LEVERAGE THE DOJ DATA. AS RECOMMENDED IN THE AUDIT WE WELCOME EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED STATE LEVEL REPORTING. AND IMPROVE UPON IT AND SLOWS TO LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA SHARING. BY OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS THROUGH THE STATE WIDE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DATA EXCHANGE INITIATIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO A MISTER HAGER SO. AND PLEASE- I ASKED IF WE COULD TRY TO STAY CLOSE TO THE FIVE MINUTES I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO CHEAP JOHNSON AFTER MR AKERS% COULD BE ON. JOIN US FOR MONTHLY SO THANK YOU. I JUST A REMINDER WHAT WE'RE ACCEPTING ANYTHING IN WRITING AS WELL TOO SO THIS IS NOT YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO. INFLUENCE OUR OUR THOUGHTS HERE SO YOU'RE OUT THERE MR HAGER. I AM AND RADIOHEAD PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU THANKS COMMITTEE- VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TODAY TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING I AM RANDALL HAGER I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS- PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA- AND AS SUCH YOU KNOW WE ARE THE AUTHOR SPONSORS EXCUSE ME OF SOME IMPORTANT BUT LOOK LEGISLATION THAT I THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT TODAY SO JUST VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW THE OTHER WAS REFERENCED BY TOBY OF AB FOUR SIXTY FIVE WHICH COLLECTS DATA AND MAKES REPORTING POSSIBLE. UNTIL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS- THAT IS ONE OF OUR BILLS WITH SENATOR EGGMAN WOW WE ALSO WHEN SPONSORED THE- THE US IS NOT PATIENT TREATMENT- AMENDMENTS AND S. B. FIVE OH SEVEN I THINK IT IS FIVE ONE SEVEN I'M SORRY- AND- WE ARE- ALSO THE SPONSORS OF THE PENDING BAIL IN THIS COMMITTEE SB- FIVE SEVENTEEN WHICH ALLOWS- HEALTH TO BE CONSIDERED IN IN TREATMENT DECISIONS FOR GREAT DISABILITY SO WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THIS SPACE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY MADE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT- WE WANT TO MAKE AND SO WE'LL JUST SORT OF. HONOR THEM KIND OF IN THE BREACH IF YOU WILL- DOCTOR WOULD HAVE YOUR WRIST YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT IT NEEDING A SINGLE POINT OF RESPONSIBILITY IN STATE GOVERNMENT WE COMPLETELY AGREE AND WE'RE GONNA RECOMMENDED THAT INDEPENDENTLY IN ANY CASE- WE ALSO- DO APPRECIATE THE REMARKS IT'S GARLAND TERRA MADE ABOUT RESOURCES FOR CONSERVATIVES AS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IN A WELL FUNDED SYSTEM- DOCTOR SHARON'S REMARKS ABOUT- CLARIFICATION OF LPS CRITERIA OBVIOUSLY WERE ACTIVE IN THAT SPACE WE BELIEVE THAT HE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT GOING FORWARD WE DO NEED SOME CLARIFICATION AND THEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE- SEEKING IN ADOPTING. MY AND YOU WAIT FOR- TO DRIVE DOWN PAGE AND SAMPLES FOR CARE. IN THE END- WOULD HELP WITH MORGAN IN I AM DE ASK WHICH THINK IS A- MEASURE GOING FOR. SO WHAT SMOKE ON SOME ISSUES HERE- AND I AND I WOULD REMISS IF I DID. HONOR THE TESTIMONY A JURY PASSED WE NEED EARLIER THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF VERY STRONGLY. SO YOU KNOW I THINK I'M ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT ONE POINT YOU WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT IT YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR LPS SYSTEMS CRISIS DRIVEN. AND TREATMENT SCHEELE OR DRIVEN AND I THINK THAT'S NOT TOO UNSURPRISING GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. I PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE UNDER SITUATIONS OR PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS OR GRAVELY DISABLED BUT- WHEN WE MAKE IS THAT- THAT DEPENDS ON WAITING FOR DANGER I THINK SOMETIMES FOR SOME PATIENTS. WAITING FOR THAT THE INTEREST TOO LATE- IT MAKES OUTCOMES WORSE FOR PATIENTS. YEAH IT DOESN'T HELP FAMILIES- IT MAKES HAS NOT PROCESS SAID IN A PSYCHIATRIST WAIT FOR ORDERS TO TREAT WHILE WEEKS CAN GO BY AND HOSPITALS. BEFORE TREATMENT CAN ACTUALLY BE APPLIED THERE ARE THERE A LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO THAT SYSTEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEEDS FOR. THE INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT STANDARDS IN THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND CIVIL RIGHTS. BUT IT ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE ARK OF INDIVIDUALS IN FRANCE AND SEND UP IN STATE HOSPITALS- AND THAT'S AN END POINT FOR MANY AND THAT MEANS THAT IT'S EITHER A LOW POINT- THE LOWEST POINT IN THEIR PERSONAL HISTORIES. WHERE THEY BURNED THROUGH RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE ABLE TO HELP THEM- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA ARC- YOU KNOW THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ARGUE CAN PROBABLY IDENTIFY MANY MISSED. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTIONS AND TREATMENT. AND IT THAT KIND OF ALLOWS US TO THE HOLES. OF ENTER- YOU KNOW THIS DIDN'T REALLY. UP HERE. YOU KNOW STRICTLY IN THE L. P. AND SPELL THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL A OF JESUS IS NOT PATIENT TREATMENT OR LARA'S LAW STATUTE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. AND I THINK THERE IS A PARADIGM THAT WE COULD LOOK AT THAT MIGHT HAVE WIDER APPLE APPLICABILITY. YOU THINK ABOUT THE PARADIGM- IT'S ABOUT- LOOKING AT A PERSON'S HISTORY- AS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF FUTURE CONSEQUENCES- SO SOMEBODY HAS AS A- AIR T. **** THE REQUIRED. TO INCIDENTS OF- HOSPITALIZATION TO REST- WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME OR ACTS OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE. YOU CAN PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW- ANTICIPATE THAT IF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF PERSONS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE DETERIORATING THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING AN ADEQUATE LEVEL SERVICES AND THEY WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HISTORY BEING ABLE TO ELL US THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AFTER WHICH- AUTHORIZATION IS- IS PROVIDED FOR TREATMENT- AND ENDS SB FIVE OH SEVEN- AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR PASSING THAT OUT THIS YEAR. WE'VE IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL STATUTES AND OUR THRESHOLD IS BECOME AN INTERVENTION TO PREVENT- A RELAPSE OR DETERIORATION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN GREAT DISABILITY OR SERIOUS HARM TO OTHERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE CAPITALIST TOOLS THAT WE CAN GET UPSTREAM. WE CAN MAKE THE INNOVATION INNOVATION- OF EARLY INTERVENTION HAPPENED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE L. P. S. I. THINK IT'S STILL VERY VALID CONCERT. AND SO. LIKE TO MOVE ON- TO THE WHOLE IDEA OF ORDERED. THERE ARE A LOT TESTING THIS LAST YEAR PARTICULARLY IN BUDGET PROCESSES WHERE. WE REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY PERSONALLY REALIZE THIS UNTIL MUCH LATER THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF STATUTES ON THE BOOKS THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS TWO BLACK CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS. ABOUT MEDICATIONS THERE ARE PROCEDURES AND STATUTES. THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A WHILE THAT ALLOW MEDICATION TO BE ORDERED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS EVEN OVER THEIR OBJECTIONS AND THAT'S IN AID OF A STABILIZING THEM AND HELPING THEM- WILL ALONG TO THE ROAD TO RECOVERY- AND THOSE ARE NOT BEING USED IN IN IN A COUPLE OF CNTEXT DOCTOR CYSTS AND- MENTIONED THAT IN IN PATIENT SETTINGS- WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE RESEARCHER. AND THAT'S WHERE COURT CAST CATASTROPHE- TO ACTUALLY MAKE DECISIONS PARTICULARLY DECISION TO REFUSE. MEDICATION AND- THERE ARE I MEAN DID. THE THAT HE A- IN HIS TESTIMONY AS WERE YOU KNOW BASICALLY PSYCHIATRISTS AND OTHER TREATMENT PEOPLE ARE SITTING ON THEIR HANDS WAITING FOR TREATMENT AND THAT WHEN A PROLONGED STAYS IN IN PATIENT SETTINGS IT PROLONGS THE SUFFERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S COST MORE FOR THE ARE JURISDICTIONS ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR THAT CARE. AND YOU KNOW THERE AE WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THE TRYING TO GET AND A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHO HAS CAPACITY DOESN'T AND ONE OF ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE LPS REFORM TASK FORCE- ADDITION TO REPORT- IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WAS TO TELESCOPE. THE WHOLE IDEA OF A PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING ALONG WITH THE CAPACITY DETERMINATION SO THAT YOU YOU INITIATE THESE THINGS BUT THEN HOURS OF AN INDIVIDUAL- BEING- BROUGHT TO A FACILITY- WORK WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EVALUATED FOR ADMISSIONS ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY YOU ALSO DO IT CAPACITY PASS AND YOU CAN START A PROCESS THERE MUCH EARLIER TO GET NEEDED NECESSARY APPROPRIATE MEDICATIONS. TO AN INDIVIDUAL APPROPRIATELY SO THAT YOU CAN ALLEVIATE SUFFERING YOU CAN REDUCES DAY YOU CAN HAVE MORE THROUGH PET- HAVE MORE EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF THE BEDS YOU HAVE BY SERVING MORE PEOPLE. SO IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND- THEY THE NEEDS I'M GONNA MOVE ON HERE TO ANOTHER POINT THE OVER. AND SINGLE POINT OF RESPONSE- TO CHAIRMAN LLOYD- IS REALLY CRITICAL- I THINK WE LOST SOME OF THAT WILL BE LOST THE OLD DEPARTMENT AND HEALTH. AND I'M AND I'M NOT SURE SURE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE REVISITING THAT ISSUE DO WE NEED WHAT ARE THE RESPECT TO ARE VERY CAPABLE AND DEDICATED- STAFFING DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED AGENCIES THAT CAN PROVIDE- WHAT IS IN MY VIEW NT BEING PROVIDED NOW TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- WORKING WITH- THEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE PASSED AB ELEVEN FOUR. AND THAT CHANGED A LITTLE BIT NINE IT WAS A CLARIFICATION OF WHAT DANGER. IN THE LPS. AND WE SAID BASICALLY IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT CONFINED IT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE CONFINED. TO THE CONCEPT OF IMMINENT DANGER NEW YORK WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HISTORY. HISTORY WILL TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE SMEBODY IN FRONT OF YOU WHO MAY BE ON THE EDGE OF BEING DANGEROUS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT READY TO THROW A BRICK THROUGH. THE WINDOW THEY DON'T. HAVE A BASEBALL BAT OR THEY'RE NOT SPREE AND- IN CHESTER AGAIN LAW BAR. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS IN STATE I GET. ONE FORSMAN AGENCY TRAINING OFFICERS COME UP TO ME AND SAY CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THE STATUTE MEANS HOW DO I TRAIN TO THIS. SO IT RAISES THE QUESTION THE LARGER QUESTION. OF WHO PROVIDES THE GUIDANCE THAT IS NEEDED OUT THERE FOR IN THIS INSTANCE. THOSE AGENCIES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN POWER THAT YOU IMPLEMENT LAW. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY STATUTORY TWEAKS THAT WE MAY. TO THE L. P. S. THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NINE TENTHS OF BIG. I'M AND IN MY VIEW THE VIEW OF SKY WE NEED A SINGLE OR A POINT OF AUTHORITY. WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE LAW. AND WE SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AS WELL AS WITHIN COUNTIES- NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE TO PROVIDE INFORMED GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES- SURE FUNDING AS WELL SPENT AND ANALYSES. OF DATA ON HOW CAN BE BETTER SPENT- TO DO THAT WILL BE CRITICAL AND NECESSARY DATA COLLECTION. SO LET ME END ON THIS FINAL POINT BECAUSE ADULTS IT TAKES THAT POINT A BIT FURTHER- WE'RE VERY I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN- REYES PRODUCT. THE DATA ISSUE AND IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE WORK WITH SENATOR EGGMAN ON IT AS YOU YOU KNOW WHEN SB. FOUR SIXTY FIVE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE CAN. AND QUALITY OF REPORTS. THAT COUNTY SANTA THE STATE I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO COLLECT THESE SORTS OF DATA- THERE'S ALSO BEEN COMMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE NEED. TO INSTITUTE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM WORD THERE IS INFORMATION SHARING. BETWEEN SYSTEMS FOR INSTANCE THE H. C. S. AND- DOJ BUT SOME SOMETIMES- YOU KNOW I KEEP WISHING THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SOURCE OF DATA ALL TOGETHER. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THIS WAY THIS DATA THAT'S NOW REQUIRED SIMPLY PROVIDES AS A LEASE- FOR- THE DATE I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT COUNTY SUPPLIED TO DH. INTERESTS SUPPLIES SIMPLE AGGREGATE A RAW NUMBERS FOR THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON HOLDS. CHAO'S SACRAMENTO COUNTY MAY HAVE ON THE ANNUAL RATE OF PUTTING. EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE ON CONSERVATORSHIP MA'AM DONE TEN THOUSAND FIFTY ONE FIFTIES. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S INTERESTING BUT WHAT DOES IT REALLY TELL YOU. I THINK DATE BETTER DATA WOULD TELL US AT THE FRONT END. YOU KNOW HOW MANY FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN SO THAT THERE IS A DETENTION. AND TRANSPORT AND THEN ARE ULTIMATELY HELD WHEN THEY WERE PRESENTED AND FACILITY. AND THE FACILITY SAYS WE AGREE WITH YOU THEY MAKE GREAT TERRY I. WOULD LIKE TO IN- WAR THE CONVERSE HOW MANY- ARE NOT- BACK BE A- IMPORTANT SAID FOR PAUL INDOOR. AND ALL. BETTER TO THE SERVICE JUNIOR- CONSUMERS AND THAT. SO I THINK WE DO NEED- MORE DATA TO TELL US MORE ABOUT QUALITY I'M IN THE FIELD- YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING ON THE BACK AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK ABOUT CONSERVATORSHIP RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM INSURGENTS LET YOU NOW IS THAT THAT'S A REDUCTION OF ONE PERSON. AND YOU ASSUME THAT% THEY'RE NOT GREAT DISABLED IT MORE BECAUSE THAT'S THE CRITERIA THAT'S LAW DEMANDS FOR RELEASE BUT WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT PERSON- M. AND THEN THE ANSWER IS NOT NOTHING AND SO HOW DO WE BEST SERVE THAT INDIVIDUAL. THERE'S A LINKAGE IS THERE THAT ARE REALLY MESSED UP AND WILL HELP US ONSELEN. SO THANK THANK YOU WE NEED TO WE TO MOVE HERE. OKAY I APOLOGIZE YOUR FIVE MINUTES WANTED TO TWELVE SO I. OKAY COLLEGES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WEEK AND THERE IS AN URGENCY HERE WE WE'VE GOT WHEN I HEAR FROM OUR CHIEF AND THEN WE DO HAVE. TO REARRANGE OUR GENERATOR HIMSELF SO PLEASE CHIEF COURT GO AHEAD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS TTK JOHNSON THE CHIEF THE LODI. OF FIRE DEPARTMENT CALVET AND ALSO ACCOUNT FOR CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEECH YOU GUYS ON BEHALF OF THE FIRE SERVICE AND THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE. A LISTENING TO MANY OF THE PRISONERS TODAY AYE AYE WE TOOK SOME NOTES DOWN SOME OF THINGS THAT I WAS LISTENING TO AND IT WAS EDUCATION FOR ME. AND UN UNFORTUNATELY FROM THE FIRE SERVICE PERSPECTIVE AND WE'RE NOT SEEING AN IMPROVEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR OR SITUATIONS OR CRISIS. IN FACT RECEIVED THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN WHO ARE RESPONDING TO. AND IF WE HAVE TO USE NINE ONE ONE AS THE INITIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WERE ALREADY FAILING. OUR FOLKS RT QUIPPED OR TRAINED TO HANDLE THESE SITUATIONS DE ESCALATION IS SOMETHING THAT'S NEW TO THE FIRE SERVICE AND UNDERSTANDING IT. AND IF WE WANNA GET TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM WE'RE AT THE START RIGHT THERE. YOU SEE CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A BUSY EMS SYSTEM. ABALONES WAIT TIMES ARE ON THE RISE THIS IS IN PART TO WHAT WE CALL A POT TIMES AND THOSE PATIENT OFTENTIMES AT THE HOSPITALS WHERE PATIENTS LITERALLY ARE WAITING FOR A BED- BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER BEDS ARE FULL. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PATIENT WHO CAME TO THE HOSPITAL AN AMBULANCE. IS NOW WAITING ON AMBULANCE GURNEY AND THAT AND BILLS ITSELF IS NOW STUCK AT THE HOSPITAL UNTIL CLEARED. WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALIZING IS NINE ONE ONE STILL CONTINUES ON THE BACKSIDE. OTHER PEOPLE ARE CALLING NINE ONE ONE FOR CARDIAC ARRESTS AND STROKES AND ASTHMA TYPE CALLS. AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THOSE PATIENTS ARE GETTING TREATED QUICKLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE AMBULANCE TO BE TRANSPORTED TRANSPORTED THAT- THOSE THAT. THOSE SICK AND INJURED A HOSPITAL. SO THAT I DON'T THINK IT DOES IDENTIFY OFTEN. IS WHEN WE SAID FIREFIGHTERS TO THESE THESE TYPES OF CALLS. WHICH SHOULD BE SEEN BY A CLINICIAN OR SOME OUTPATIENT THERAPY. WE START TO ERODE AT THE FIREFIGHTERS OF MENTAL WELL BEING FOR DELIVERING THE SERVICES YOU SEE THEY GET THERE THEY RESPOND THEY PROVIDE THE BASIC OF NEEDS BASIC LIFE SUPPORT ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT. THE TAKE THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE VERY NEXT DAY THEY SEE THE SAME PATIENT. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY SEE THE SAME PATIENT AGAIN MORE TIMES THAN NOT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN CRISIS THE USED THE NINE ONE ONE AS THE DIRECT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE SEE THAT ROUTINELY. AND WHAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE GROUP FOR AS FAR AS WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME SOLUTIONS WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. WELL I WROTE DOWN TO SOME SIMPLE THOUGHTS. THE CALIFORNIA MERCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY MSA. REGULATES THEIR REGULATORY AUTHORITY THROUGH THEIR LENSES AND LOCAL IMMERSION MEDICAL SERVICES THIRTY. LENSES OFTEN TIME RESTRICT FIRE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING BASIC LEVELS OF SERVICES BASED UPON THEIR THORNY SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOR THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE BILL. WHERE IT ALSO HAS PART OF IT AND ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION. THE FIRE SERVICE MORE TIMES THAN NOT IN CLIFORNIA IS THE TIP OF THE SPEAR FOR HEALTH CARE. WE ARE GOOD AT TRIAGE AND WHAT TRIAGE MEANS IS TO SORT WE DO IT RIGHT NOW FOR TRAUMA PATIENTS ARE BURNED PATIENTS ARE PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THIS IS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF OUR DEPLOYMENT. THE FIRE SERVICE OFTENTIMES PIVOTS BASED UPON THE COMMUNITY NEED WELL THIS I'M TELLING YOU TODAY IS THE COMMUNITY THERE IS A MASSIVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING. WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE I THINK WE COULD LEVERAGE THAT COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE BILL AND ALLOW FIRE DEPARTMENTS. TO PROVIDE THAT TRIAGE. TO HELP SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND TAKING THOSE PATIENTS OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM. ADDITIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BRING TRAINING FROM THE STATE LEVEL DOWN FOR DE ESCALATION AND UNDERSTANDING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. FUNDING IS GOING TO BECOME KEY BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ARE RUN ARE GONNA REQUIRE SOME TYPE OF FUNDING MECHANISM TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN. AND THEN ALSO ASK. THERE'S A SAFETY COMPONENT TO THIS AS WELL FIRE IBM IS COMPANIES RESPOND ON THESE TYPES OF CALLS OFTENTIMES THERE'S A WEAPON INVOLVED THERE'S A FIRE THERE'S OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE TOTALITY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU GUYS MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND- I'M GONNA- FROM SHELTER BETTER YOU HAD MENTIONED THE MOBILE CRISIS FOR PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE PARITY. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE ANOTHER LEVEL OF DETAIL AS WELL AS- NOTICED THAT OUR STATE IS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING A NEW NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM BY JUNE OF NEXT YEAR AND WHAT ROLE THAT NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE WITH THE MOBILE CRISIS UNIT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM BLAST SO I WILL TAKE THIS- IN TWO PARTS FIRST- EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF NEXT YEAR- PHONE USERS WILL BE ABLE TO DIAL OF AN EASY THREE DIGIT NUMBER NINE EIGHT EIGHT TO ACCESS TE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE. AND THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT'S BEING USHERED IN- PURSUANT TO FEDERAL LAW NEXT YEAR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND AND HAS PROVIDED TWENTY MILLION IN FUNDING FOR THOSE NINE EIGHTY CALL CENTERS. WE HAVE THIRTEEN OF THEM ACROSS THE STATE TWO OF THEM ARE RUN BY A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEY ARE PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAY HAVE SUICIDAL IDEATION I OFTENTIMES THEY ARE STAFFED BY VOLUNTEERS AND THAT SORT OF THING SO. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SERVICE IT'S ONE THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FUNDS- EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT RUNNING THIS CALL CENTERS- AND IT'LL REALLY HELP I THINK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TIME OF CRISIS TO HAVE AN EASY TO REMEMBER NUMBER TO DIAL. I THINK WHAT'S CHALLENGING IS THAT OFTENTIMES THAT CONVERSATION IS CONFLATED WITH AN EXPECTATION OR HOPE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SOMEHOW ALSO MAGICALLY MANIFEST A BRAND NEW. PARALLEL TO EMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE WHICH I WILL JUST SAY WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET WE HAVE NOT CREATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE STRUCTURES LIKE THE PARALLEL LIMB SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO CREATE. OR THE MOBILE CRISIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN A CONSISTENT WAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THIS GOES BACK TO SOME OF WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE EARLY COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING STRUCTURE. COUNTY SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN DOING MOBILE CRISIS FOR DECADES NOW THEY'RE VERY EXPERIENCED BUT THERE IS NO WAY FOR US TO CONSISTENTLY FUNDS THOSE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM IT'S NOT A- SPECIFIC BENEFIT FOR EITHER MEDICAL OR- COMMERCIALLY INSURED INDIVIDUALS. AND SO KIND OF PATCH WORKING IT TOGETHER AND THEN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS GET VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY SAY WELL THERE'S ALL THIS VARIATION COUNTY EXCESSIVE THE COUNTY WHY DOESN'T AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU. GRANT AN ENTIRE SYSTEM WHEN YOU MAKE IT BASED ON COMPETITIVE GRANTS. OR VERY LIMITED FUNDING AND SO IF WE WANT TO CREATE THAT MOBILE CRISIS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT IT AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE CAN GET THERE IF THAT'S WHAT WE CHOOSE TO DO FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT THE DEMAND. ADD TO THE CHIEFS POINTS. IS REALLY THERE FOR SOMETHING MORE IN THAT SPACE- YOUR STATEMENT REGARDING PARITY IS SOMETHING WE AS A STATE THOUGH SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY. AND THE NEED FOR US TO PROVIDE THOSE CRISIS SERVICES IN THOSE TIMES OF NEED IS IMPERATIVE PROCESS THE STATE SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOW UP CONVERSATIONS AND ANY DATA YOU MAY HAVE FROM THOSE COUNTIES WHICH HAVE HAD PROGRAMS. UP AND RUNNING FOR A WALK THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. DESERVES COMMENT ON A COMPLETELY AGREED THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY RETHINK THAT SYSTEM AND SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIRE SERVICE TO EIGHT A BETTER RESPONSE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEARINGS ON THE BILL AS IT WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IT REPRESENTED. BUT IN REALITY FOR COUNTIES OF LOCAL PROVIDERS IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO FIND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES INSTEAD OF JUST PUTTING EVERYBODY FORTUNATELY THE SAME. BRACKET WHERE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ADEQUATE RESPOND TO CROSS THE BOARD FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO IT IT'S IT WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WATCHING CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO END UP WHERE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSES UNLESS A STATE STEPS IN AND IMPROVISES STANDARD. FUNDING IN IN THE SENSE OF WHAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US AND THERE WILL BE BUILDING GOING THROUGH THIS YEAR TO TRY AND EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS PUT ON THE TABLE TO REALLY PALTRY COMPARED TO WHAT THAT INVESTMENT COULD BE. AND THE BENEFIT IF I MAY UM CHAIR STONE I MEAN I THINK ONE THING I DO WANT TO CALL OUT BECAUSE IT IS A LEGAL ISSUE IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE REQUIRED IN TERMS OF- HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS DOCTORS SELLERS SPOKE TO THIS HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES THERE IS UNDER THE LAW FEDERALLY AND STATE LAW NO DISTINCTION DR ARAMBULA JUST MENTION THAT. AND SO I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE CERTAIN PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND THE PHYSICIANS IN THE ROOM CAN SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THAN I CAN ME UP HERE INITIALLY TO BE A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY OR OR SITUATION BUT THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE A PHYSICAL HEALTH NEED THAT THAT HAS TO BE REVIEWED BY A AND M. D. AND THAT'S WHY OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY A REALLY IMPORTANT BACKSTOP AND WE CANNOT. ENTIRELY DIVORCE WHAT IS WHAT IS OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK AND OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE NEED MORE SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS WE NEED MORE SPECIALIZATION IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSIDE OUR HOSPITALS INSIDE OF OUR EMS SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR STATE FRANKLY BUT WE ALSO. DO NEED TO BUILD OUT MORE SPECIALIZATION BOTH WITHIN OUR PUBLIC DELIVERY SYSTEM FROM MEDICAL MANAGED CARE THROUGH TO MOVE FAR MORE SERVICES AND OUR SPECIAL TEAMS SAFETYNET AND THEN IN THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AS WELL SO I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST MESSAGE HERE IS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE A PART OF THIS AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT KIND OF EDUCATION THAT THE- CHIEF WAS TALKING ABOUT. CORRECT AND I WAS REALLY TALKING TO THE INITIAL CONTACT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WITH SOMEBODY'S IN CRISIS AND THEY CALL THE POLICE SO THEY CALLEDTHE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO ARE MORE USED TO DEALING WITH PHYSICAL. ALMONDS THE IN THE HOSPITAL SHOULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHING AND SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY TRAINED FOR BOTH PHYSICAL MENTAL THERE SHOULD BE THAT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE. BUT IF WE HAD. A BETTER WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS IN. AN EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL CRISIS. TO THEN GET INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT THAT ENTRY SO THAT THERE ARE. LIKE FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE TRAINED.FOR FIRES IN FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDICAL EMERGENCIES HAVING AN APPROPRIATE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THAT LINE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND THE DISPATCH APPROPRIATE AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. IS ONE PIECE THAT WE'RE MISSING. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE PANEL MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR TIME WITH US HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT ORDER A LITTLE BIT OF A TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY- MY- CO CHAIR HERE. WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MOVE DOWN TO- PANEL C. JUST FOR ONE WITNESS AND THAT IS- MAYOR MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG SO I'LL LET YOU TAKE SO YES OKAY SO THE NEXT LEGAL PANEL IF YOU JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE WE WILL TRY AND- TAKE. THEIR STEINBERG OUT OF ORDER HE HAS THE SITUATION AND HE'S DEALING WITH AND- I THINK THIS WILL BE MORE EXPEDITIOUS SO IS. THERE A TIME BERMAN A LOT. YEAH I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES ARE UP. I GOT FIVE MINUTES VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR. YOUR FLEXIBILITY IN ACCOMMODATING ME I HAVE THE- OF THE SITUATION AND DEAL WITH BUT I DID NOT WANT TO MISS THIS TODAY I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIRMAN STONE IN SHERMAN WOULD NOT ONLY ARE THEY TEARING BUT FOR THE SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE HAVE HAD ON THIS SUBJECT. I'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT- I SPEAK I SUPPOSE IS THE MAYOR OF SACRAMENTO IS THE- FORMER STATE SENATE LEADER AND THE AUTHOR OF BOTH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE NEED AUTHORS WELL AS S. B. EIGHTY TWO WHICH WAS- THE LARGE INVESTMENT IN CRISIS- INTERVENTION. IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN- IT'S PROBABLY NO SURPRISE TO HEAR ME SAY THAT WHILE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. SAYS THAT ONLY INCREMENTAL CHANGES POSSIBLE. IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THE BROKEN NATURE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. E. INABILITY OF PEOPLE TO ACCESS TIMELY CARE. THE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING MAKES BOLD AND FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THE ONLY REAL CHOICE I CAUGHT THE END OF THE LAST PANEL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND CRISIS CARE AND HEARD FROM- MICHELLE COMBAT AS WELL AS- THE FIRE CHIEF NINE EIGHT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND YET IT IS ONE PIECE. OF THE FIFTH IT NEEDED FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HOLDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IS THE ONLY CHOICE AND I BELIEVE THE TIME FOR THAT IS NOW BOTH. YOU JUST GO OUT JUST THAT WHEN WE GET PROPOSITIONS DIRECTED TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WELL WE WON THE ELECTION- MENTAL HEALTH NEVER PLACED AT THE TOP OF THE PUBLIC CONCERNS NOW MENTAL HEALTH HOMELESSNESS OUR TOP ANY AND EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC OPINION POLL THAT IS DONE IN CALIFORNIA IN ANY OF OUR MAJOR SIT. IN TERMS WHAT THE PUBLIC IS CONCERNED ABOUT TODAY'S TOPIC I KNOW IS LPS. AND THE BULK OF THE DISCUSSION I SUPPOSE WILL BE ON WHETHER AND HOW TO TREAT INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT STANDARDS IT'S AN IMPORTANT AND LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION OF COURSE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD UPDATE THE DEFINITION OF RAPE THE BILL YOU TO CONFORM. TO BOTH THE REALITIES AND THE EXTENT OF THE HOMELESS CRISIS. AND TO CONFORM TO JUST PLAIN COMMON SENSE I KNOW YOU WILL HEAR IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY FOR DOC. SHARE IN THE L. A. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO I THINK IS- DOES A VERY IMPORTANT THINKING. ON REDEFINING GRAVE DISABILITY TO ENSURE THAT IT FIND NOT JUST IN A MOMENT'S TIME WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY BE SUFFERING FROM STE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN PRESENT THEMSELVES IN A WAY TO SAY THAT THEY'RE GREATLY DISABLED IT NEEDS TO BE A DEFINITION THAT ACTUALLY CONFORMS TO. I SITUATION OF THEIR LIVING OUTDOORS SIX BASICALLY AND MENTALLY AND IT'S BEEN OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME. THE DEFINITION OF GREAT DISABILITY SHOULD ALLOW ABOUT US AS A SOCIETY BE ABLE TO HELP THEM VOLUNTARILY YES FIRST BUT IT'S NOT TO SAY EVERY UP. IN WHAT WAY BECAUSE LIVING ON THE STREETS IS PLAYING AN ACCEPTABLE IN THE CURRENT DEFINITION. AND AT LEAST ITS INTERPRETATION DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE REALITY IN MY VIEW OF THE SUFFERING OUT THERE BUT I WOULD USE THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME IF I'VE GOT TWO OR THREE MINUTES LEFT. THE FLIP THE CONVERSATION ON ITS HEAD. AS YOU KNOW- A LEGAL RIGHT TO HOUSING. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A LEGAL RIGHT TO HOUSING. WOULD FORCE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS. TO BUILD MORE TO PRODUCE MORE SHELTER TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSE. IN A WAY THAT WOULD BETTER MEET THE NEEDS THE LAW CURRENTLY SAYS THAT NO CITY NO COUNTY. NOR THE STATE DESPITE THE LEADERSHIP THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE PUT MORE MONEY THAN EVER AN EASY ISSUES WE ARE NOT REQUIRED. HE SAID. AND ALL OF THE OBSTACLES WHETHER IT BE ISM EXCESSIVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER REGULATION. EXCESSIVE COST LACK OF HOUSING INNOVATION ALL ARE MORE POWERFUL BUILD MORE BECAUSE THERE'S NO LEGAL OBLIGATION THAT CAN HELP. THOSE OBSTACLES SOME CRITICS MADE THAT FOR MANY OUT ON THE STREET. L. ELLIS HOUSING ISN'T HE ISSUE MENTAL HEALTH IS ALL RIGHT- THE CITY MAYOR HOUSING IS THE BEST PROXY I HAVE FOR HELPING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE- CITIES DON'T. PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IT'S A THIS IS THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU AND THEN I WILL. TURN IT BACK OVER. WHILE MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT SIDE OF THE L. P. S. ACT. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE ORIGINAL STATE. DECISION MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT PASSED THE L. P. S. ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AND THEN THE LANHAM ACT TEN YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE LETTERMAN ACT OF COURSE DEALT WITH DEVELOP PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WHAT WAS THE FATEFUL DECISION A DISTINCTION. FOR PEOPLE TO. THE ABILITIES THE LEGISLATURE SAID THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE A RIGHT TO TREAT WITH. AB RIGHT TO TREATMENT AND ABILITY H. DIRKSEN SUPPORTS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT THE LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT HAS NO RIGHT TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NO ONE TITLE. IT DID NOT DIG DEEP THE SYSTEM IS FAR FROM PERFECT BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE A GUARANTEE IN THE LAW THAT PEOPLE ARE CARED FOR. THE EXACT OPPOSITE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT YOU SHOULD. WELL THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORY BUT I CAN TELL YOU AT LEAST IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE NATION. BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVING WITH SEVERE AND SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE SEEN AS LESSER THAN BY OUR SOCIETY INSIDIOUS DISCRIMINATION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HOMELESS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE HOW WOULD BROAD BRUSH THEM AS AS AS LESS THAN WORTHY OF OUR CARE AND TREATMENT. IN MY VIEW IS BENEATH US AS LEADERS IN. CIVIL SOCIETY. AND SO MY PLEA TO YOU TODAY. IS TO CONSIDER GOAL MAY. BUT MENTAL HEALTH AT LEAST FOR THE MOST SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL ON PAR. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MAKE MENTAL HEALTH AT LEAST FOR THOSE WITH THE MOST SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT THIS IS A RIGHT OR AN ENTITLEMENT. WILL PUT L. EIGHTEEN DEAR BEIJING GREAT INITIATIVE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM ON STEROIDS IN A POSITIVE WAY. THIS SYSTEM IS TERRIBLY FRAGMENTED YOU'VE GOT PRIVATE PAY YOU'VE GOT MEDICAID YOU'VE GOT THE PUBLIC SYSTEM YOU'VE GOT JAIL INCREASE CARE YOU'VE GOT TO. BE CAREFUL AND YOU KNOW THAT IT IS FOR PEOPLE OF MEANS FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE WHO- NO I TO NAVIGATE SYSTEMS. IT IS INCORRECT WE HARD TO GET HELP RESOURCES FOR YOUR LOVED ONE. A LEGAL RIGHT TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST SEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY L. WOULD FORCE THOSE SYSTEMS JUST LIKE WITH THE RIGHT TO HOUSING TECH BEHAVE AND ACT DIFFERENTLY. TO INTEGRATE INSTEAD OF FRAGMENT AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I APPRECIATE- ARE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THESE TOUGH ISSUES BUT- THE PUBLIC HOLD BACK ANY BOLD IDEA THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET HELP AND I KNOW WHAT THE ARGUMENT IS AGAINST MY RIGHT THINKING AND RIGHT. NOW THERE. WE'RE ALREADY ABOUT FOUR MINUTES OVER SO IF YOU COULD YOU ARE COMMENTING. THANK YOU COST COST IS TOO EXPENSIVE SOME WILL SAY WHATEVER THE PRICE TAG IS LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE SUBTRACT WHAT WE ARE SPENDING NOW IN HUMAN AND FINANCIAL TERMS FOR THE TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVE GOING ON NOT JUST OUT ON OUR STREETS BUT IN MANY BACK BEDROOMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA YOU GUYS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE NEXT. LETTERMAN'S YEAH IN THIS STATE AND TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL AND BOLD CHANGE AND I'M HERE TO HELP YOU THANK YOU IN ANY WAY. I CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK UP TO POWER IN THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT THE LEGAL WE HAVE HOW DO PRIDGEN CHIEF OF POLICE CITY OF SAN LEANDRO. JUDGE QUINN AGAIN SCARLET HUES AGAIN TIFFANY LEON SENATE AGAIN- THE LAST THREE OR- I BELIEVE HERE SO YOU HAVE COME UP AND IS CHIEF PRIDGEN ONLINE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN I ASK OUR TEETH NICE TO SEE HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GERMAN- REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE SURE CHECKED IT FROM CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WITH YOU AND UP REALLY THANKFUL FOR THIS INVITATION. SO AGAIN MY NAME IS ABDUL PRIDGEN I'M CURRENTLY THE POLICE CHIEF IN SAN DIEGO I'M ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MYSTICALLY SHE'S IN CALIFORNIA. THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS ONE OF INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE S. POLICIES IMPACT THOUSANDS OF LIVES EACH YEAR. ALL AGREE TOPICS ARE NOT NEW. YEARS WE HAVE ALL STRUGGLED WITH THE CHALLENGES TO THE OPS ACT OF FIFTY ONE FIFTY FOUR PROCEDURES AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE SERVICES. REALITY IS THAT EACH OF THESE. ABOUT ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX THE SYSTEM FOR RESPONDING TO THESE SITUATIONS IT'S EQUALLY AS INTRICATE. AS REPRESENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA POLICE ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO PROVIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE SYSTEM ENSURE THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES- BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING C. PCA CONDUCTED A SURVEY. OF OUR MEMBERS REGARDING THE LOOK AT PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS OF YEP YES ACT AS WELL AS IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY. CONSISTENT THEMES EMERGE FROM THE RESPONSES WE COLLECTED I LIKE TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW FIRST THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES DEDICATED TO MENTAL HEALTH. THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT HOSPITAL BEDS TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR THOSE IN NEED WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE E. R. IS THE ONLY APPROVED DESTINATION FOR FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLES. EACH OF US. LIMITED BEDS CREATE DELAYS AND TRANSPORTABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT ANY MESS. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SEEING INCREASINGLY HIGH PATIENT AWFUL TIME TO CROSS THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO INADEQUATE DETOX AND TREATMENT FACILITIES WHICH ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE MOST HOSPITALS WILL NOT TAKE PATIENTS WERE CURRENTLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NARCOTICS. IT MORE MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE DURING THE INITIAL RESPONSE. WE NEED MLTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS IN THE FIELD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND TO CONNECT THOSE WERE SUFFERING TO SERVICES. SECOND THERE ARE PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS AGREED CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD. CURRENTLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT RIGHT FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLES. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT CANNOT WRITE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS. EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT PLACES A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD ON INDIVIDUAL. OFTENTIMES END UP RIGHT BACK IN THE SAME SITUATION. FINALLY THERE ARE LEGAL ISSUES THAT PRESENT MANY DIFFICULT THINGS. INFORMATION ONE CAN SHARE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS LIMITED BY THE PROTECTIONS. RESTRICT RESCUES ME RESTRICTING WHAT WE KNOW CONFINES OUR ABILITY TO MAKE OPTIMAL DECISIONS. THERE IS NO CENTRAL DATABASE OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES ASIAN HISTORY. OR MECHANISM TO TRACK THE SAME INDIVIDUALS RECURRING THAT'S- THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF INSTANCES WHERE INSURANCE COVERAGE. HAS NOT BEEN- EXCUSE ME HAS IMPEDED SERVICE. OUR DEFINITIONS FOR GRAVELY DISABLED DANGER TO SELF DANGER TO OTHERS DO NOT ENCOMPASS THE VARIED CIRCUMSTANCES OFFICERS ENCOUNTER FOR RICKY CHASES OCCURRING OVER TIME. FINALLY THE FOURTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM ENTERING THE HOUSE OR PRIVATE FACILITY IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS THE ONLY A THREAT TO THEMSELVES WHICH CAUSES ISSUES WHEN FAMILY MEMBERS ALL THE POLICE AND EXPECT OUR OFFICERS TO ENSURE THE WHOLE. MANY OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS ARE. PLEX WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS YOUR YEAR HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO ABBREVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT ARE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED. FIRST OF ALL PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE UNITS CBCA SUPPORTS CO DEPLOYMENT TEAMS COMPRISED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. INCLUDING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ALLOWS US TO BETTER NAVIGATE SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THE FIELD SINCE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT INFORMATION. ESTABLISHED MORE DETOX AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE FACILITIES ALLOW ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS FOR THOSE PATIENTS OUTSIDE EMERGENCY ROOMS. ALLOW FIRE EMS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO WRITE FIFTY ONE FIFTY GOALS WORKFORCE CITY LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY ENTITY. WITH THIS AUTHORITY. EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF BREAKING BRAVELY DISABLED- POSSIBLY TO INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE FIFTY ONE SHOULD BE MORE THAN THREE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLES PLACED HONEST. PERSON A CERTAIN TIME FRAME. A CREATE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT RESOURCES. BASS BASS AND PATIENT HISTORY. IF NARCOTICS ARE PRESENT DURING A MENTAL HEALTH HOLD SERVICE PROVIDER SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO EXPAND HE MAKES THEM TO HOLD UNTIL THE DRUG SYMPTOMS SUBSIDE. STUDIES SHOW THAT TIME FRAME IS ROUGHLY TEN DAYS FOR STIMULATE COST PSYCHOSIS AT A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS ONLY SEVENTY TWO HOURS. ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRED INPUT AND COLLABORATION WITH THE VARIOUS. BOB PEOPLE WERE IMPACTED SUCH AS FIRE HOSPITAL'S EMS ASIAN ADVOCATES COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND MORE. SOME OF THE SAME GROUPS THAT ARE HERE TODAY AND REPRESENTED ON THIS DISCUSSION. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH YOU AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS. THANK YOU TO. GREG WILL NOW MOVE TO. THAT'S QUITE ALRIGHT THANK YOU I'M PLEASED TO BE BACK THIS IS ON RIGHT YEAH ALL RIGHT SO- I'LL TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF- SOME ISSUES I KIND OF PREVIEWED IN MY MORNING COMMENTS- REMAIN THE SAME YOU KNOW THAT WE FIND PLACEMENT TO BE A PRETTY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AT TIMES AND OF COURSE IT'S A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PLACE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE- SETTING- AND OFTEN TIMES THE APPROPRIATE TO- YOU KNOW SETTING ISN'T AVAILABLE SO. BE GREAT IF WE HAD MORE BEDS- BASICALLY OUTSIDE THE LOCKED YOU KNOW SUB ACUTE FACILITY LEVEL- IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE HAD MORE BEDS FOR SPECIALIZED CARE- OFTEN TIMES THAT'S- THE MOST BUT THAT YOU KNOW THE MOST APPROPRIATE SPECIALIZED CARE IS AT THE STATE HOSPITAL AND AS WE HEARD- BEFORE YOU KNOW THE STATE HOSPITAL BEDS ARE TAKEN UP- BY- CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED FOLKS- AND SO AREN'T SO AVAILABLE TO TOO MANY LPS- PATIENTS. AND PLACEMENTS FOR MINORS- I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S BASICALLY MAYBE TWO MAYBE ONE- FACILITIES- WHERE MINORS CAN BE PLACED IN THE BOTH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO- PLACEMENT FOR MINORS THAT IS- CLOSE TO WHERE THE FAMILY IS. I ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I- MENTIONED IN THE MORNING WAS TRANSITIONAL SERVICES YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT CYCLING- PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF THE L. P. S. SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW AS WE AS I SIT THERE AND GET THE JUDGES OVER THESE- PROCEEDINGS. AND SEE SOMEONE IMPROVE IMPROVE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY NO LONGER GRAVELY DISABLED- AND THEN THEY COME BACK SIX MONTHS LATER. IN MUCH WORSE SHAPE- THE MAYBE WITHIN THE START OF IT CERTAINLY WHEN THE- CONSERVATORSHIP WAS TERMINATED. AND RIGHT NOW IT'S MOSTLY IT'S- LPS CONSERVATORSHIP EXISTS OR DOESN'T EXIST AND THERE'S NOT A LOT. THAT I SEE- HOW THEIR AT- TO TRANSITION FOLKS- AND FIVE OH SEVEN IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT GREAT- START AND ONCE IMPLEMENTED MAYBE WILL BE- A SIGNIFICANT- HERE- BUT I THINK THAT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN NOT. NOT SUGGESTING ANY- ANY- ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD WORK OR NOT I HOPE IT DOES- AND THEN YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE YOU. I'M HERE AS A JUDGE YOU KNOW THROUGH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO YOU KNOW AS FAR AS CHANGES TO THE ACT REALLY ARE COMMENTS WILL BE LIMITED TO- ADMINISTRATIVE. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE MATTERS- WHICH AREN'T REALLY THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS AND IN SO TO SAVE TIME- WE WILL SUBMIT ANY SUGGESTIONS ALONG THOSE LINES IN RIGHT- BUT- ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS I TALKED ABOUT HOW WE PROCEED AND SAM JUST GO. I THINK OUR JUDICIAL PROCESS WORKS FAIRLY WELL- I KNOW OTHER COURTS DO IT DIFFERENTLY AND- SO OVERALL I WOULD ENCOURAGE- TO MAINTAIN AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE DONE- BECAUSE EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT AND EVERY COMMUNITY AND WHAT WORKS IN. ONE COMMUNITY MAY NOT WORK IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. THE YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THIS IS GOOD AFTERNOON EXCUSE ME ASSEMBLY STONE AND SANTIAGO I'M SCARLET HUES AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GUARDIAN SOME PUBLIC CONSERVATORS AND OUR MEMBERS- BIRDS STATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC CONSERVATORSHIP GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES. THE COUNTIES MADE THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO ENSURE PARITY OF SERVICES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. THE SHOESTRING NATURE OF FUNDING HAMPERS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR CASES BUT ALSO PRECLUDES SPENDING ANY TIME ON DATA GATHERING AND OUTCOME MEASURES. ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD ALSO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AGENCY AND THE CREATION OF DEDICATED STATE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS TO ENSURE ENSURE SERVICE QUALITY% AND DELIVERY AND THE CREATION OF DEDICATED STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STATEWIDE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM. TO ANALYZE PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATOR ACTIVITIES NO CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE WIDE NEED FOR CONSERVATORSHIP SERVICES AND NO VISION FOR HOW PUBLIC GUARDING CONSERVATORSHIP SERVICES COULD BE DELIVERED MORE EFFECTIVELY. PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS ADMINISTER THEIR PROGRAMS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF ANY STATE BY DATA OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE% AND APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY COULD ASSURE PURELY STATISTICAL DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE. STANDARDIZED SERVICE DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS AND DRIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING STATE FUNDING FOR SUCH RESEARCH RELATED TO CONSERVATORSHIP PRACTICES WE WELCOME PARTNERING WITH THE STATE AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS AND RESEARCHERS. OVER THE PAST YEAR. CONSERVATORSHIP HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY. PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCUSED OF USING OUR POWERS AND AUTHORITY AND APPROPRIATELY I CONSERVING THOSE WHO DO NOT NEED THAT LEVEL OF INTERVENTION WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME BEING BLAMED FOR NOT USING OUR AUTHORITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND WHO ARE HOMELESS UNSHELTERED INDIVIDUALS AND TRAGIC CONDITIONS. WE WELCOME ALL EFFORTS TO BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT TO POLICYMAKERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS POLITE AS WELL AS TO ENHANCE OUR PRACTICES. HOWEVER WITHOUT FUNDING. WE CANNOT SUPPORT ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THAT INCREASE AUTHORITY FOR OUR RESPONSIBILITIES WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO DO THAT ANY LONGER. IN CLOSING ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PROVIDING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN IMPROVE LPS CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAMS. AS WE LOOK TOWARD THE BUDGET CYCLE NEXT YEAR WE ANTICIPATE PURSUING A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR I'M GOING BUDGET REQUEST AND URGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO JOIN US IN SUPPORT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU AND THE GOVERNOR TO INFORM THE POLICY DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS AND SURE THIS THAT ENSURES THIS CRUCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM HAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO SERVE THE CALIFORNIANS IN OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. CORRECT THIS BEYONCE. INSTEAD OF EXPANDING EIGHT CONSERVATORSHIP AND GUARDIANSHIP. HAPPY MOTHER'S AB THE BUTTON NEXT TO THE MICROPHONE RECORDS ON THANK YOU OKAY. INSTEAD OF EXPANDING A CONSERVATORSHIP UNIT THAT IS ALREADY X. IMPACTED I'M HERE TO OFFER YOU SOME MORE SOLUTIONS. FOCUSED ON PRE TRIAL THE STATE HAS OFFERED PRE TRIAL FUNDING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROBATION OFFICERS TO DO SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING. BUT THE STATE ALSO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY DURING PRE TRIAL TO. ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE RECENTLY ARRESTED IDENTIFY THEM WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND LINK UP TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IN CASE MANAGEMENT TO GET OUT OF JAIL. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PARTNERED WITH THEIR DEPARTMENT BEAVER HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ASSISTANCE AND WE DID JUST THAT. THE LAST NINE MONTHS WE HAVE CONTACTED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE IN JAIL AND HAVE DONE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS USING FOR EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS. OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE ARE LINKED TO MENTAL HEALTH. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE FOR LINKED TO SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND A HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE WERE HOUSED. THAT IS THE RESULT OF DEPARTMENTS GETTING OUT OF THEIR SILOS AND WORKING TOGETHER. AND IT WORKS WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN A 3% RECIDIVISM RATE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE TO HELP COORDINATE SYSTEM SERVICES. AND THEN YOU HAVE THEM CASE MANAGE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED. THEN YOU CAN WORK WITH YOUR PROBATION LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT E EVER HEALTH YOU CAN GUARANTEE THEY COME BACK TO COURT WE CAN ALSO OFFER THEM TREATMENT. THE OTHER SOLUTION I WOULD SAY IS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUR DIVERSION PROGRAM. WE USE DEPARTMENT A STATE HOSPITAL GRANTS WE BUILT A FORENSIC CONTENT CONTINUUM OF CARE WITH INTER COUNTY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN RESULTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE WERE ABLE TO GET THIRTY THREE PEOPLE GRANTED FELONY MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. WE WERE ABLE WE NOW HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE PEOPLE PENDING THE WAIT LIST TO GET IN. THAT PROGRAM WORKS BECAUSE IT OFFERS CLIENTS AN ALTERNATIVE PLEADING GUILTY TO GET MENTAL HEALTH THEY CAN HAVE THEIR- CASE- DIVERTED WITHOUT SAYING THAT THEY'RE GUILTY. IT ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT ONE STOP SHOP FUNDING WE JUST CREATED ONE WE'VE HEARD THAT TESTIMONYBEFORE REMOVE THE BARRIERS OF PEOPLE HAVING TO GO ALL OVER THE COUNTY TO GET SERVICES BRING THEM ALL UNDER ONE ROOF SO THEY CAN MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER T. HA DEPARTMENT BE EVER HEALTH SEPT D. SO THEY CAN GET ASSESSED IN LENGTH AND CAN GET EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER. AND ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT WE LOOK AT THE LPS LAW. ONE OF THE THING SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS DOING WHICH IS REALLY UNIQUE IS WE DO BASICALLY C. F. CFT IS INDEPENDENT THE SYSTEM CHILD FAMILY THERAPY. THOSE ARE MEETINGS THAT YOU CALL WHERE THE KID SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM AND EVERYBODY SURROUNDS THE KID AND- PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO SUPPORT. THAT YOU. WERE DOING THAT AN LPS WE HAVE OUR LPS CLIENT COME TO THE TABLE WHERE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER COUNTY COUNCIL PUBLIC GUARDIAN. WE GET TOGETHER WITH THE PROVIDERS AND SAY WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL TO ENGAGE AND TREATMENTS. I ALSO HAVE THE COURT OR THE STATE LOOK AT OUR FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLES IN OUR SEARCH AND HOW WE'RE DOING THOSE HEARINGS. THERE IS NO FORMAL HEARING ON THAT FIFTY ONE FIFTY WE'RE LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MEET WITH CLIENTS TO ENGAGE TO LINK TO MAKE SURE CORONATION OF KERR IS HAPPENING. SO THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL TO COME RIGHT BACK IN ANOTHER FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR LEAVE THE HOSPITAL INGLEWOOD FOR JAIL. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR- ACT IN AND OF ITSELF. I'D ALSO ENCOURAGE US TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ALTERNATIVE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND THE JAIL. WITH ZERO BAIL WHAT HAPPENS IS INDIVIDUALS GET CITED ON A MISDEMEANOR AND THEY MAY NOT COME TO COURT FOR THREE MONTHS SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS WORKING ON THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACTUALLY CONTACT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. WE'VE CONTACTED SOMEBODY. AND THE STREETS AND YOU DECIDED I'M OUT LET'S GET HIM TO MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION SOONER THAN LATER LET'S TAKE OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT CRITICAL TIME WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN CRISIS. AND ENGAGE THEM BECAUSE IF WE WAIT THREE MONTHS TO ENGAGE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE THEN YOU DO AT THE TIME OF CRISIS. THE OTHER THING I WOULD DO IS ECHO WHAT THE CHIEF SAID WE NEED DATA SHARING THE ONLY WAY WE GET DATA SHARING RIGHT NOW IS A RELASE OF INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. SO THERE'S ALL OF THE SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT HAVE ALL THIS INFORMATION IF WE HAD ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION WE COULD COORDINATE CARE. AND ENCOURAGE THIS STATE TO CONTINUE DOING RECORD MODIFICATION WORK RECORD MODIFICATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE HELPED CLEAR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLES- THAT WERE HOMELESS WITH THEIR RECORDS. THOSE THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE NEEDED FIFTEEN HUNDRED TOUCHES. BUT WE STILL HAVE BARRIERS BUT THAT WE STILL ARE CHARGING PEOPLE A HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS TO HAVE AN EXPUNGEMENT FILING FEE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT. WE HAVE TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS PUBLIC DEFENDER ALSO NEEDS FUNDING JUST LIKE THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE THAT IS NOT STATE FUNDED YET ITS MANDATE IN THE STATURE THAT THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN OR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER REPRESENT PEOPLE. AT THESE RED OF HABEAS CORPUS IS AT THE LPS- BUT WE'RE NOT FUNDED TO DO THAT EITHER SO WE HAVE TO COMPETE FOR THOSE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. FOR THAT REPRESENTATION OF SERVICES GUARDIAN'S OFFICE HAS TO. WE NEED SYSTEM COORDINATION AND CARE WE NEED DOCTORS AVAILABLE TO WRITE DECLARATIONS WE NEED- FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND SYSTEM CORONATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY. THANK YOU. CORRECT ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. SANTIAGO THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US WHEN WE'VETRIED- THESE ENDEAVORS AS WELL AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PIECE ABOUT- MORE REVENUE IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS- WORK. AND I UNDERSTAND CAPACITY ISSUES AND- A LOT OF THAT IS THANKS TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE TALKED TO ME IN THE PAST ABOUT THIS AND I'VE COME TO CONCLUSION I GUESS YOU DO. AND I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU. ON THE PANEL BUT IT'S BUT- HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH- I STILL STRUGGLE WITH WITH TRYING TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM- AND- THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT REALLY STRUGGLING WITH IT WILL LIKE HELP GIVE. BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES IN YOU AND I HAVE- WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE THERE. ISN'T AN ATTACK TO. THE SHOULD BE ABLE OUR EFFORTS NOT BE PERCEIVED. AS SOMETHING TO LIMIT SOMEBODY'S. CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT. YOU KNOW IN AND I WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO STAND WITH ALL ADVOCATES THE STATE. LET'S NOT DO THAT. BUT ARE THOSE INSTANCES AND- WHERE. INDIVIDUALS DO NEED THAT HELP. AND EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT AND I AND I KNOWLEDGE THAT IN MY KNOWLEDGE IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE PREVENTIVE. AND IN A RECOGNIZABLE TRYING TO DO GOOD WORK HERE. BUT BUT IN SOME COMMUNITIES YOU NOW HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE WHERE THE PROBLEMS- HAVE GOTTEN SO BIG LIKE THE DISTRICT THAT I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING. THAT HISTORICALLY HAS HAD POPULATIONS- WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. IN THE POLLS RIGHT TO THE PLACE. THERE ARE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CARE ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE- SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES WERE. TRAUMA ISSUES AND JUST LAYERS AND LAYERS COMPILED IT BUT WE'VE I WOULD STILL ARGUE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN- SO THAT WE ARE BRINGING THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S MORE HUMANE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THAT STAGE. THEN TO ALLOW THEM. GEN DO NOT GIVE THEM THE ACCESS TO THIS TO THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT'S WHY STRUGGLE IN IT I DON'T DISAGREE ON A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT IT THAT YOU ARE SAYING AND I AND I. AM GRATEFUL TO THE CONVERSATION OVER THE YEARS. ON THESE ISSUES AND SPECIALLY PURPLE CHAIRS FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND IT IS AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE. AND I'M SECURE I'M GOING A LITTLE BIT LONG ON THIS BUT I. BUT I STILL STRUGGLE AND PUSH GENTLY TO ASK BUT WHAT WOULD WE DO IF WE REALLY WANTED TO IMPROVE IT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT. A LOT OF FOLKS. FOR HER ON THE STREET. WHO MAY NOT BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN ASK FOR HELP THEMSELVES AT THAT MOMENT BUT WE KNOW IF THEY'RE IN GRAVE. IN DESPERATE NEED OF IT AND THAT'S WHY STRUGGLE IN LET. THIRTY PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE YEAH IT'S A VERY SMALL POPULATION I WOULD ARGUE COMPARED TO WHAT WE SEE. IS THAT NEED OUT THERE AND A LITTLE SKID ROW FOR EXAMPLE AND NOT ALL POPULATIONS WILL FIT IN THAT PARTICULAR- DISAPPEARED ON DESCRIBING THAT PARTICULAR PERSON. AND I USE ROUNDED NUMBER SO FOR THOSE WHO FACT CHECK ALL THAT WE SAY WE'RE USING RANDOM NUMBERS. BUT YOU GOT A LITTLE SHY OF FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A FEW SQUARE BLOCKS AND IF YOU WERE TO TRAVEL JUST LATER RIGHT THERE. YES I WOULD ALMOST DETER SOMEBODY TO ARGUE THAT IS MORE HUMANE TO LEAVE SOMEBODY ON THE STREET AND IT WOULD BE TO BRING A MAN TO GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AND DESERVE AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT'S WHY I CHALLENGE YOU TO CHALLENGE ME AS WELL. AND I'M HOPING THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER ON THIS TO. TRY TO CHANGE SME OF THESE. LAWS FOR THE SAKE. OF HELPING. HUMAN BEINGS. WHO DESERVES THAT SORT OF DIGNITY. AND I ASK YOU WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE NO MATTER WHO ARGUES WITH ME THAT WE DO NEED- TO HELP OF LIFT OFF THE STREETS. IN INTO A MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN INTO SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN THE SYSTEM CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM ANYMORE. THIRTY PEOPLE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE IN LINE PROBABLY GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO COULD USE THE HELP IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY IN LOS ANGELES YOU HAVE A- I'M UNITEDROUNDED NUMBERS AGAIN SIZE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WORKING HOMELESS SEAT OF LOS ANGELES- MODEL FORTY TWO FORTY THREE. THOUSAND PEOPLE USE ROUND NUMBERS WHO ARE HOMELESS. I CAN'T IMAGINE- THAT WE CAN FIND LARGE PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES WITHIN THAT POPULATION THERE'S- THAT DESERVE. A HUMANE APPROACH TO THAT IN LEAVING AND I'M ON THE STREETS FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTING A STAT A STATUS QUO OR A SET OF STATUS QUO LAWS IT IS SIMPLY HUMANE I WANT TO BE GOOD MAYBE HE'LL TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT WENEED TO CHANGE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT OR TO HELP PEOPLE- IF WE HAD TO CHANGE THINGS- WITHIN OUR- LITTLE LETTERMAN ACTIVE LPO. I MEAN WE GOT LAYERS AND LAYERS OF THINGS. YOU KNOW THE IN LAURA'S LAW WE- WILL BE GONE FOREVER ON THE DIFFERENT LAYERS A LAW THAT ARE MEANT TO. AND PROGRAMS ARE MEANT TO HELP PEOPLE BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY WOULD ARGUE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T. GOING AND GOING BY THE LARGEST NUMBERS ON THE STREET AND THEY NEED DESPERATE HELP. I KNOW THAT L. A. COUNTY HAS. SIX ASSET WITH WORKING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS AND LOOKING AT THEM- AT CONSERVING THEM BUT STRAIGHT FROM THE STREET BECAUSE THEN IT HAS BEEN TOO DIFFICULT TO TRY TO GET THEM INTO A TREATMENT CENTER BECAUSE OF. THEIR UNWILLING TO GO TO THAT LENGTH TO GET THEIR TREATMENT AND THEY'RE REFUSING TREATMENT SO THEY START WITH THEM ON THE STREET AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THAT PROGRAM ALTHOUGH VERY SUCCESSFUL IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TEAM APPROACH THEY'VE GOT A PSYCHIATRIST A SOCIAL WORKER A PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATOR DEPUTY AND I THINK ONE OTHER MAYBE A NURSE OF SOME KIND THAT TEAM GOES OUT. TO SEE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREETS AND THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IT'S A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH. BUT IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM AND THERE THE ONLY COUNTY THAT HAS HAD THE RESOURCE NINETY TWO AND NINETY. YEAH YES IT IN SO. THOSE KINDS OF WHOLE PERSON APPROACHES HAVE THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT THEM BUT THERE ARE TO DO THAT STATE WHY WOULD BE- I CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO CALCULATE THE COST OF THAT TO DO THAT ST WORK FOR SOMEONE TO GET CONCERNED BECAUSE IT'S SO. IT DOES TAKE A TEAM APPROACH AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS TO GET THAT KIND OF SYSTEM IN PLACE. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE ONE PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY VERY SUCCESSFUL. ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES. I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THEY ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO DEAL WITH WHAT THAT WHAT THEY'VE GOT ON THEIR PLATE BECAUSE WE DON'T CONTROL THE FRONT DOOR WE DON'T CONTROL- AND BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY DEDICATED STATE FUNDING THERE'S ONLY THE COUNTY GENERAL FUND AND WHAT LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THE COUNTIES CAN COLLECT IN FEES BUT BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH THE INDIGENT POPULATION. EVEN THOUGH THE COURT AWARDS ARE FEES WE CAN'T COLLECT THEM 90% OF THE TIME AS A PUBLIC GARDENING CONSERVATOR AND SO MAKING COUNTY I HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BOOKS I WAS NEVER GOING TO SEE BECAUSE I COULDN'T COLLECT THOSE FEES SO MOST OF OUR MEMBERS DON'T HAVE THE DON'T HAVE THE- BILITY. TO DO THOSE THOSE INTENSIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NEEDED TO BRING THOSE INDIVIDUALS OFFICE DIRECTLY OFF THE STREET. MISTER CHAIRMAN MANIFOLD MMHM. A. N. YOU DON'T HAVE A MORE COMPETITION WITH YOU SORRY MY MASCOT SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT WHAT WOULD YOU STREAMLINED EXAMINE I AGREE THAT- THAT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL AND I SEEN THEM- YOU TAKE A LONG TIME. AND IN PARTNERSHIP WOULD YOU SAY WHAT WE NEED TO STREAMLINED BECAUSE IT WITH MY PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW YOU PLACE SURE THIS AS WELL IT'S IN HUMANE BELIEVE SOMEBODY OUT THERE FOR THAT LONG FOR THE SAKE OF. FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUE TO TRIAL BE MIL. THEY GIVE YOU SEE. HELP REGULATE IN TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT WE HAVE SOME INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS- WE ARE CELEBRATING FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS I FORGET. AT THE CALDER SUBRING HOMES WERE ONCE SOMEBODY. HAS USED ENOUGH DRUGS IN THE PASS OUT IN. THEIR ON THE VERGE. THEY BRING THEM INTO THESE- THESE A NURSING FACILITIES AND WE HAVE SOME ON SKID ROW IN. IT AND IF YOU WERE IF AN EPIDEMIC MY COLLEAGUES I'VE EVER SEEN MONEY IT'S A REAL TO SEE. ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET LET ALONE. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. SOMEBODY BEING BROUGHT INTO THESE THINGS WITH SYRINGES ON THEM BECAUSE- MOMENTS AWAY FROM POSSIBLY NOT BEING THERE AND IT COULD'VE BEEN PREVENTED IF WE JUST. BROUGHT THE PERSON AND EARLY AND GAVE ON THAT HELP- AND THAT'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING FOR RIGHT NOW IT'S WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU. HOW TO MAGIC WAND MONEY TO RADICALLY QUICKER TO HELP PEOPLE AND ADDRESS IT LIKE THE EMERGENCY THAT IS. THE CHALLENGING PART ABOUT IT ALL DAY LONG IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE- THE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT REALLY CRITICAL- SERVICE STREAMLINING IT. YOU RUN THE RISK OF VIOLATING THAT INDIVIDUAL CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE PROTECTION OF THE LPS ACT WAS PUT INTO PLACE FOR ALL OF OUR PROTECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF US ARE. TAKEN IN PUT INTO A LOCKED FACILITY AGAINST OUR WILL WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU STREAMLINED DUE PROCESS WITHOUT VIOLATING THAT INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS. UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT INTENSIVE THERAPY- THAT INTENSIVE SERVICE UP FRONT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET ALL THE PIECES THAT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT THEM. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE BUT YOU HEARD IT THIS MORNING STREAMLINING. WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS TO GET THEM TO ENGAGE IN SERVICES WITH YOU TAKES FORTY VISITS TAKES FORTY CUMBERLAND I RECOGNIZE. I'VE I'VE GONE TO ENOUGH TENNYSON AGAIN PLEASE RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION YOUR QUESTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT THIS WHOLE HEARINGS ABOUT. AND WE'VE BEEN ADDED FOUR EIGHT HALF HOURS NOW. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S FAIR TO ASK THEM THAT QUESTION WHEN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IS GOING ON HERE AND IT'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION. TO ANSWER GIVEN THAT THE TIME CONSTRAINTS THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE BUILT AROUND HERE SO AND I THINK THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. OUT SIDE OF THIS HEARING BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT'S HERE AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE WHOLE HEARING. I RECOMMEND SEEING HEARING. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PUT ON THE TABLE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN A LOT OF. A LOT OF THESE PERSPECTIVES OF. IT HAS BEEN A PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. OKAY THAT. GOOD OKAY TO THIS PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THAT WE WILL MOVE TO THE- ADVOCATES PART WE HAD THE MAYOR STEINBERG HAD A REQUEST FROM JENNIFER FREE BACK. TO BONTA THE TOP THE LIST SO I'M GOING TO DO THAT NOW SHE'S STILL ON THE LINE. YES I AM OKAY AND THEN WE WILL ALSO THAT WE HAVE ANDREW IMPARATO SUSAN CHOI GOOD MEN. HERE IN PERSON AND THEN ALSO CAN LOWEST REMOTELY ONLINE. SERVICE THREE BUT- THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS FOR HAVING ME. WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THE STREET LEVEL IN MY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IS A VICTORY STATE YET ALARMING EROSION OF THE HOUSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS MENTAL HEALTH SCALE LOSSES AND REDUCTIONS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SIMULTANEOUSLY BEARING WITNESS TO INCREASE SECURITY INCREASE PREVENTABLE AND FAR TOO EARLY DEATHS AS PEOPLE SEE DOOR AFTER DOOR SLAMMED INSTINCTS. LAST YEAR WE HAD THE COALITION- RELEASED A REPORT ENTITLED REVOLVING DOOR WHERE WE INTERVIEWED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED ON HEALTH PEOPLE ASK THEM TWO HUNDRED QUESTIONS TO TWENTY FIVE FOCUS GROUPS IN COLLABORATION WITH FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES. ABOUT HALF FOR SIMPLE INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO STRUGGLED WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN WE DUG DEEP INTO THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. NOTABLY 60% REPORTED EXPERIENCING IN UP MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND SAN FRANCISCO BUT ALMOST HALF NEVER GOT THE CARE THEY NEEDED AT THE TIME. HERE'S A QUOTE FROM ONE YOUNG HOMELESS MOM WHO WAS ONE OF THE MANY SURVEY RESPONDENTS SEEKING CARE REALLY BACKED UP RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE WAITLIST FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THEY HAVE A LONG WAIT LIST I ALSO WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET HELP AND THEY ALL HAVE WAIT LISTS. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IN SOMEWHERE. WHEN SURVEY RESPONDENTS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS TREATMENT 72% NOTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH HOWEVER FAR TOO OFTEN AFTER COMPLETING TREATMENT THERE WAS NO PLACEMENTS AND STABLE HOUSING AFTER LEAVING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT ONLY 99% OF OUR SURVEY PARTICIPANTS LANDED IN STABLE HOUSING. YET AFTER TREATMENT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR TREATMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. HERE'S A QUOTE FROM HOMELESS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN IN HER FIFTIES WHEN I FIRST TRIED TO GET HELP I WENT TO SANFRANCISCO GENERAL ON AT THIS TIME I STAYED ON THE SIXTH FLOOR IN THE MENTAL WARD A TOTAL OF TWO WEEKS. AND THEN THEY RELEASED ME BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SO THAT WAS MY FIRST ENTRY OF HELP. WHILE ANOTHER PARTICIPANT STATED. THINGS GOT MUCH BETTER FOR ME ONCE I GOT ESTABLISHED IN THE COOP I STARTED GOING TO THE DAY TREATMENT CENTER USING THE SUPPORT GROUP THAT HELPS ME CLEAR MY MIND.I STILL FIND THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS I FEEL BETTER USING THE SUPPORT GROUPS TO DO SOMETHING FOR MY MENTAL ATTITUDE. COOPS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION CONCERT FLATS OR APARTMENTS ARE RENTED OR PURCHASED AND SHARE CASE MANAGEMENT AT SCATTERED SITES. IDEALLY INDIVIDUALS LEAVING RESIDENTIAL CARE ONCE STABILIZED MOVE INTO THEM ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE THE STATE COULD FIND NEEDS ENSURING STABILITY FOR Q. CLIENTS. OTHERS MAY NEED EVEN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE AND THAT INCLUDES PREPARATION HILLS SUCH AS QUALITY BOARDING CARE WE CAN ALSO REIMAGINE BOARDING CARES A SHARED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SPACES THAT BUILD COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT LESS BUREAUCRACY AND MORE FUNDING. ALSO IN HIGH DEMAND OR SUPPORT OF HOUSING YOU. FOR OTHERS YOU CAN'T LIVE IN PRIVATE SPACES INDEPENDENTLY GOTTA HAVE STOPPED BEYOND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FOR FOLKS WHO CAN'T LIVE IN PRIVATE SPACES INDEPENDENTLY THIS MARKET SUCCESSFUL FOR- FOR ADULTS OF THE TOTAL THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE UNDUPLICATED SAN FRANCISCO CLIENTS RECORDED IN THE AVATAR. I WAS RECEIVING pTWO THIRDS HAD CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DIAGNOSES HOWEVER DESPITE MANY EFFORTS FUTURE PROGRAMS ARE TRULY AN EQUAL THE DUAL DIAGNOSIS COMPANIES. LEAVING INSTEAD IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER- FOR PHILLY NIGHT TREATMENT GOAL EFFECTIVELY. RECOMMENDATION IS TO EXPAND HIGH DEMAND. DUAL DIAGNOSIS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. SO THAT'S WHAT MENTAL TREATMENT IS OFTEN IN TEN WAYS THE CULTURE. A LANGUAGE WITHOUT GROUND. ESSENTIAL TRUCK STEP TO CRAFT IT'S CRITICAL THAT OUR SYSTEM IS DIVERSE ENOUGH TO MEET THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMANITY. A FIFTY THREE YEAR OLD TRANS WOMAN RECALLS HER STRUGGLE WITH FINDING A THERAPIST TO FIT BETTER NEEDS. ACCESS TO CARE IS IMPOSSIBLE I CANNOT SEE TO MAKE THEIR PETS MY BIGGEST BARRIERS FEELING SAFE AND FINDING AN APPROPRIATE PROVIDER. IN MANY OF OUR MUNICIPALITIES WE HAVE STAFFING SHORTAGES MEANWHILE WE HAVE POOLS OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND NATURAL SKILL. YOUR SUPPORT SERVICES ARE OFTEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN POLITICAL PEERS DEVELOP TRUST INSPIRE HOPE BUILD COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE COUNSELING. GIVEN THE LACK OF PREVENTIVE AND COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH CARE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE LIKE AT YOUR CRISES EACH YEAR IT'S SF. OVERWHELMINGLY THE RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS IS A POLICE OFFICER. WILL BE SHOULD NOT FUNCTION AS FIRST RESPONDERS IN PSYCHIATRIC CRISES NORTH FIREMEN. ABSENT A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY THIS IS BOTH INEFFECTIVE AND COSTLY AT LEAST HARM UPON PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND INJURIES ON THE PART OF THE OFFICERS. SAN FRANCISCO HAS AN OVER RELIANCE ON HIGH AND CARE. WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR NEVER GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED UNTIL THEY'RE IN CRISIS THAT'S THE POINT. WE'RE AVOIDING FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WE HAVE A DECENT SYSTEM THEY END UP IN A REVOLVING DOOR OF EMERGENCY HOSPITAL BASED CARE AND BACK TO THE STREETS. OR OTHERS WHO ARE HOLDEN EXPENSIVE BEDS BECAUSE LOWER LEVEL OF KERR'S ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IN DEVELOPING POLICY AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO FOLKS WHO ARE LIVING IN THIS. EXPANDED OUR SYSTEMOF COMMUNITY CARE INSURANCE STABLE HOUSING POST TREATMENT. YOU'RE NOT CONTROVERSIAL HEADLINE GRABBERS THEY'RE NOT SILVER BULLETS BUT THEY WORK INSTEAD THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH WORK ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON ATTEMPTS TO WHITE IN THE DOOR OF A LOCK SYSTEM. THAT HAS NO PLACEMENTS FOR PEOPLE ONLY TO HAVE THOSE INDIVIDUAL STEP THROUGH SORRY I'M ALMOST DONE. THIS CREATES A TROUBLE TURNING IN ORDER FOR OUR- HEALTH SYSTEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE MUST EMBRACE THE POWER OF THE MANAGED TO TRANSFORM EVEN WHEN INVOLVED. IN OVERWHELMING DESPAIR THIS TRANSFORMATION HAPPENS WHEN AGENCY. SELF DETERMINATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE. EXIST THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANDREW IMPARATO. YEAH THANK YOU SERVICE STARK AIR AMERICA. YES THANK YOU SIR WERE THE STAFF MY NAME IS ANDY FOR HONORABLY THAT IS- THIS IS YOUR LIFE CALIFORNIA I STARTED MY JOB LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OF THIS MY FIRST TIME TRYING TO FIGURE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE I'VE POINT THERE'S A LOT OF MOVIES THERE BEFORE COMING BACK TO MY HOME STATE AND I WAS. THERE ARE GETTING TO THE VOTER OFFICE DIRECTOR THE U. S. SENATE ON HEALTH IF LABOR. THANK YOU FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE NOT BE VERY THIS LAW SO I RECOMMEND YOU SPEND. SHE WAS ABOUT FOR SO- I'M ALSO. WITH NEXT WITH POLAR DISORDER WHICH I'VE BEEN OPEN ABOUT THROW OUT MY CAREER AND I'M GONNA. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. IN MY ROOM THAT FOR I JUST TO. ASSIST MYSELF WITH WHAT YOU'RE HEARD GENERAL I THINK SHOULD VERY L. MADE THE CASE FOR A- AND FOR SELF THE L. EIGHT. YESTERDAY ADDED TO. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DETERMINATION. AND AS A DISABILITY CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN SELF DETERMINATION. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A LONG TERM STRATEGY. THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. BILL THE KIND OF LIVES THAT THEY DESERVE- WE HAD FOUR KEY POINTS THAT I MAKE BRIEFLY A AND R. LETTER WHICH YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF. FIRST JUST RESPECT THE DIVERSITY OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT SOME OF THE WITNESSES TODAY HAVE TALKED ABOUT. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WITH A BROAD. BRUSH IT'S A VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES JUST TAKE MY DIAGNOSIS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER. YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE DOLLY PARTON AND TED TURNER. AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS ON THE STREET. IT'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT IS VERY COMMON BUT NOT EVERYBODY WHO HAS THE DIAGNOSIS IS OPEN ABOUT IT. AND I JUST THINK- JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT. PEOPLE CAN END UP IN A FIFTY ONE FIFTIES SITUATION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM YOU WOULD THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM. SO IT'S JUST A IT'S A BIG POPULATION IT'S A DIVERSE POPULATION. AND IF THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS OR PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET. YOU'RE NOT SEEING HIM AT ALL THE. THE FULL SPECTRUM OF THE POPULATION- ANOTHER POINTWE MADE IN OUR TEST. IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LETTERMAN PATRIS SHORT ACT. IS N. THE INAPPROPRIATE INDEFINITE AN INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT OF PERSONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS THAT'S THE PURPOSE. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT CERTAIN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS IS NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT PURPOSE WE SHOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN THIS STATE RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CRISIS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET HELP. AND THEY GET PUT ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP WHY ARE WE TAKING AWAY THEIR LIBERTY WHEN ALL THEY NEED IS GOOD CARE. SO I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT LPS REFORM DON'T START WITH THE IDEA THAT WE NEED MORE POWER TO TAKE AWAY RIGHTS START WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS EXISTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM HAVING THEIR RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY- THE NEXT ONE I WANTED TO MAKE. IS WE NEED TO IMPROVE TRUTH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONSISTENCY ON THIS ACROSS ALL YOUR WITNESSES. WE NEED TO IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE DETAINED ON LPS HOLDS AND CONSERVATORSHIP. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GETTING DETAINED DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE GETTING GOOD MENTL HEALTH TREATMENT- AND IT AND IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO EXPRESSLY REQUIRE. EFFECTIVE TRANSITION PLANNING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RELEASED FROM BOTH SHORT TERM LPS SOLD. AND LONG TERM LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW AND IF WE MAKE THIS TREATMENT DURING THE TRANSITION. VOLUNTARY PERSON CENTERED AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE. WE'RE GONNA SET SOMEBODY UP FOR SUCCESS OVER THE LONG TERM. THE THIRD POINT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY WITNESSES TODAY AS WE NEED BETTER DATA AND WE NEED THE DATA TO BE DISAGGREGATED BY RACE. ETHNICITY AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS SO WE KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. SO FINALLY JUST IN TERMS OF MY STORY- THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGO I WAS A STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AND I WENT VERY QUICKLY FROM BEING HAPPY TALKING A LOT IN CLASS I HAD RECENTLY GOTTEN MARRIED. TO HAVING NO ENERGY NO SELF CONFIDENCE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING OUT OF BED VERY DIFFICULT FIGURE OUT THAT I COULD HAVE A CAREER AS A LAWYER. AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST THING I'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH IN MY LIFE. I GOT MARRIED THE SUMMER BEFORE MY WIFE HELPED ME STAY ON THE CONVEYOR BELT THAT I WAS ON I STAYED IN SCHOOL I GRADUATED I WORK FOR LEGAL SERVICES THAT SUMMER. AND ENDED UP CLERKING FOR A FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE AND I GOT MY LIFE TOGETHER AND I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A CAREER. AS A DISABILITY RIGHTS LAWYER A VERY SUCCESSFUL CAREER. MY WIFE AND I RAISED TWO CHILDREN YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD GOOD LIVES TOGETHER. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME WAS STAYING ON THE CONVEYOR BELT AND IF I HAD GONE TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. AND THEY PUT ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND MAYBE TOLD BY HARVARD LAW SCHOOL WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEN COME BACK TO US WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BETTER. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT AND NEVER GOT BACK ON SO I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SYSTEM. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE CONNECTED. TO THE HEALTHY THINGS IN THEIR LIVES THEY'RE GOING TO HELP THEM REBUILD THEIR LIVES. KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO THEIR SPOUSE OF THEIR MARRIAGE. KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO THEIR JOB IF THEY'RE WORKING. KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO THEIR SCHOOLING. IF THEY'RE PURSUING AN ADVANCED DEGREE OR A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND I THINK OUR SYSTEM SOMETIMES SAYS WE'RE GONNA KNOCK YOU OFF OF THAT. AND LET YOU DEAL WITH YOUR ILLNESS AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK. KNOCKING PEOPLE OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT CAN BE THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO TO THEM. AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANT TO QUOTE. THE EDITORIAL FROM THE L. A. TIMES YESTERDAY. THIS WAS THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MOST POWERFUL TO ME THEY SAID A SOCIETY THAT PROVIDES PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IS NOT AT ODDS WITH ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THE PERSON'S AUTHORITY OVER THEIR LIFE AND BODY. NOR IS HUMAN DIGNITY OPPOSED TO SELF DETERMINATION. IN FACT THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE DEEPLY. INTERTWINED SO AGAIN I JUST REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU. AS YOU THINK ABOUT REFORM. RECOGNIZE THE CORE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE LAND FROM PATRICK SHORT ACT. WHICH IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST HAVING THEIR LIBERTIES TAKEN AWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AND THEN SUSAN CHUCKLED. HELLO THANK YOU OFFICES AND GOOD MEN. AND I'M HERE TODAY OF. FIRST TOOK OFF IN THE BACK NAY FOR THEM OR THE THINGS- I'M REMINDED OF PARAPHRASE A BEATLES SONG I AM YOU AND YOU ARE ME. I USED TO SET UP THEIR NEXT TO MY BOSS WHO WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. AND- WE NEVER TALK TO MENTAL HEALTH AT THAT TIME. BUT ANYWAY I GRADUATED COLLEGE I BECAME A TEACHER GOT A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND THEN STARTED WORKING I WAS THE DEPUTY DA IN LA I WAS THE DEPUTY DA CHIEF DEPUTY AND YOU'LL KILL ME AND THEN A DEPUTY DA HERE IN SACRAMENTO. NOTHING IN ALL THOSE YEARS PREPAREDME TO BE THE PARENT OF A CHILD WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS NOTHING. OF SO AFTER HAVING TWO KIDS I STOPPED WORKING HERE AT THE TIME MY ULTIMATE BUS WAS WILLIE BROWN AND HE SAID YOU CAN NOT WORK HERE IF YOU WANT TO COMMUTE FROM HOME YOU WORK HERE TIMES HAVE CHANGED- I STILL STATE INTERESTED IN LOCAL POLITICS RAN FOR MY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ANDWAS ON THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS. ALSO WAS A PRESIDENT OF NAMI AND DID SOME OF CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING FOR POLICE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. SO I JUST MENTION ALL THIS BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE I SAID THERE'S NOTHING IN ALL THAT EXPERIENCE. THAT PREPARED ME TO TRY TO BE THE BEST MOTHER I COULD TO MY SON. MY SON IS NOW THIRTY THREE. AND% OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO HE STARTED SHOWING SOME STRANGE BEHAVIORS SOME DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORS TALKING IN SOME STRANGE. THE LANGUAGE. AND IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS TO GET HIM TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST WHEN HE FINALLY DID HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA DEPRESSION AND SEVERAL MOOD DISORDERS. DURING THE TIME THAT HE- BEFORE THAT LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY. HE WAS SOMEONE WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO DENIED HIS ILLNESS I THINK IT'S PRONOUNCED AT AND THOSE WITH NO SHIP. AND HE WENT FOUR YEARS WITH NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM HE DIDN'T NEED TREATMENT DURING ALL OF THAT TIME HE WAS EITHER LIVING ON THE STREETS. OCCASIONALLY IN MY BACKYARD IN JAIL FOR SEVERAL FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE HOLDS THAT BECAME A LITTLE LONGER THAT WAS A LIFE HE LIVED IN MY I CANNOT STRESS TO YOU ENOUGH THAT LPS HAVE TO CONSIDER THOSE PEOPLE WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO DENIED THEIR ILLNESS WHO DON'T HAVE INSIGHT. THEY'RE COMPLETELY ALMOST COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED IN OUR SYSTEM AND I UNDERSTAND IT GETS POLITICAL BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS AND CHOICE BUT THERE'S ROOM. FOR BOTH IN L. P. S. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I WILL TO MENTION OF. BESIDES THAT WAS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WORDS WHICH IS CARE GIVER. AND I HAVEN'T HEARD A THING TODAY ABOUT CARE GIVERS. I KNOW MORE ABOUT MY SON THAN ANYONE ELSE I'VE GIVEN HIM MORE TREATMENT THAN ANYONE ELSE I'VE BEEN AROUND HIM ALL HIS LIFE I DON'T COUNT. HIPPLE PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM TALKING TO ME ATTITUDE PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM TALKING TO ME THE POLICE WON'T TALK TO ME THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TO MY HOUSE NUMEROUS TIMES AND THE ONLY ADVICE THEY GAVE ME BELIEVE IT OR NOT WAS WHY DON'T YOU PACK UP YOUR STUFF AND MOVE AWAY AND DON'T TELL THEM WHERE YOU ARE. SO YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE GIVERS INTO ACCOUNT. YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND OCEAN SANDERS SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE SOME ROOM FOR DISCUSSION ABOUT DUAL DIAGNOSIS YOU'LL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A SCHIZOPHRENIC WHO HASN'T TRIED METHAMPHETAMINE AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS OR HER LIFE. AND YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THE ROLE. THAT CARE GIVERS COULD HAVE IF THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. SO WITH THAT I SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU HE CHRISSY YOUR TESTIMONY. AND A FINAL PANELIST FOR THIS SECTION KIM LEWIS. WHO'S WITH US REMOTELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS WOOD AND STONE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KIM LEWIS AND THE MANAGING ATTORNEY OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE ON- TO TALK ON THIS PANEL ABOUT THIS VERY CRITICAL TOPIC. VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE LPS ACT AS I'VE WORKED FOR TEN YEARS AS LEGAL DIRECTOR. SORRY JUSTIN MY CAMERA- THE PATIENT'S RIGHTS PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE I WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR OF LPS FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY. I REPRESENTED HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS WE'RE COMMITTED TO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTY JAILS ARE PLACED ON LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. SO I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS TO THE COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATURE. AREN'T AT FOR CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING WHETHER ANY FURTHER CHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR THE LPS ACT. AND WHICH POINTS DO NOT SUPPORT FURTHER BROADENING INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT. TIMES MOST RECENTLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THOSE LAWS NEED TO BE DEMONSTRATE. HOW BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES. SOME HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDERATION PILOTS ALLOWED INSURANCE DISCO IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT WERE CREATED BY S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE AND FURTHER BROADENED. THROUGH AB FORTY IN TWENTY NINETEEN NEED TO BE EVALUATED. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THESE ARE EFFECTIVE AND MUST BE FOR THE BROAD. IN FACT THE FINAL REPORT ON THESE VERY QUESTIONS IS NT DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE UNTIL JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE MORNING ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT HAS BEEN EXPANDED MULTIPLE TIMES. FIRST IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE MOST RECENT CHANGES HAVE NOT EVEN TAKEN EFFECT YET. AND STILL MORE BILLS ARE CONTINUING TO BE INTRODUCED TO BRIBE FURTHER BROADEN THE CIVIL COMMITMENT LAWS. WHERE IS THE JUSTIFICATION OF BRIGHTON A. O. T. WITHOUT DEMONSTRATING THE BENEFITS OR VALUE WAITING OUTCOMES OF THESE CHANGES THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE ALREADY MADE. DESPITE HEARING SOME EVIDENCE TO THAT A. O. T. WORKS. AS I SAID EVERY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF B. O. T. HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT MANDATING OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THROUGH A COURT ORDER IS EFFECTIVE. AND AS PROFESSOR DINNERS TEEN DISCUSSED EARLIER THERE ARE EFFECTIVE VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND NOT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF STATE POLICY SOLUTIONS SUCH AS A SEARCH ASSISTIVE. ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT WHICH IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED TEAM TO. SERVICE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT ADULTS WITH THE MOST INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND A CITY IS ENDORSED AND SUPPORTED BY SAM SO THERE'S FOUR DECADES OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ON THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE SECOND. I'M MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MODELS MUST BE EXPANDED AS JENNIFER I THINK EL ELOQUENTLY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ON THIS PANEL. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH. CONDITIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WHO ARE UN HOUSED IS THAT INDIVIDUAL HOUSING THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE. SO INDIVIDUAL HOUSING TRANSITION TENANCY SUPPORT SERVICES TO SUPPORT TRANSITION CHIU AND MAINTENANCE OF HOUSING IS CRITICAL. SUCH SERVICES INCLUDING ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY PREFERENCES AND BARRIERS TO HOUSING DEVELOPING A HOUSING SUPPORT PLAN WITH GOALS DEVELOPING A HOUSING CRISIS PLAN TO PREVENT DISRUPTION OF HOUSING. EARLIER IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION FOR BEHAVIORS THAT MAY JEOPARDIZE HOUSING EDUCATION AND TRAINING ABOUT HOW TO MAINTAIN HOUSING. AND THE ROLES OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS AND ASSISTANCE IN RESOLVING DISPUTES AND LINKAGES TO OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO PREVENT INFECTION. AS I STATED THIS MORNING PROP SIXTY THREE AND THEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO EXPAND. VOLUNTARY SERVICES THROUGH AB THIRTY FOUR AND TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THAT WERE ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND TO STAB WISH THE INTEGRATED SERVICE MODEL OF SUPPORTING HOUSING FOR ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES AND ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. THOSE SERVICES INCLUDE OUTREACH MEDICAL CARE SHORT TERM HOUSING. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OCCASIONAL TRAINING AND SELF HELP AND SOCIAL REHABILITATION. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THREE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOUND THE SERVICE TO BE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AT REDUCING. PARTICIPANTS HOSPITALIZATIONS INCARCERATIONS AND HOMELESSNESS. WELL INCREASING THEIR EMPLOYMENT. IN FACT THIS PROGRAM WAS SEEN AS A NATIONAL MODEL FOR ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS. YET TO DATE BE SUPPORTED HOUSING PROGRAMS HAVE NOT RECEIVED ADEQUATE INVESTMENT ABROAD TO SCALE STATEWIDE DESPITE EVIDENCE FROM AT LEAST ONE LARGE STUDY BY YOU SEE A PASSED THE PHONE PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT SUPPORT OF HOUSING IF IT'S OFFERED TO THEM. INSTEAD M. HSA FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR INVOLUNTARY OUTPATIENT. SYSTEM TREATMENT. AND AS A FISCAL MATCH FOR MEDICAL COVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. STATE MUST INCREASE INVESTMENT INCLUDING AN HSA FUNDS TO GROW EVIDENCE BASED SUPPORT OF HOUSING MODELS. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS. MEDICARE COVERED SERVICES INSTEAD OF. INCREASING RELIANCE ON A. O. T. OR BRIGHTENING LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. AND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT MAYBE EFFECTIVE. BUT THERE AREN'T CONSISTENT PROGRAMS AND THERE AREN'T A STATE WIDE OUTCOMES FOR THIS. SO THIRD MY FINAL POINT MORE RECESSED SOURCES ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND BUILD CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY. MEDICALS THE LARGEST PAYER OF BE HERE HOLD SERVICES OVER THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS RELYING ON IT FOR COVERAGE. MANY PEOPLE SUBJECT LPS ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE. THE STATE IS ALSO IN THE MIDST OF UNDERTAKING A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF MEDICO CALLIE. EFFORT OR INITIATIVE INCLUDING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES AND COVERAGE OF NEW TYPES OF SERVICES SUCH AS PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST SERVICES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. YET ACCESS REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM CANNOT MEET THE CURRENT DEMAND FOR SERVICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MOST RECENT REPORT. ON PROVIDER NETWORKS FOR MEDICAL SPECIALTY MEDICAL SERVICES FOUND THAT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE FIFTY SIX COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A PASSING NETWORK ADEQUACY RATING. SEPTEMBER CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION REPORT THAT EXAMINED BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS AND ASSESS CHALLENGES RELATED TO ACCESS. TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR MEDICARE ENROLLEES FROM THE DEMAND EXCEEDS SUPPLY. THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE ACCESS ISSUES INCLUDE CHRONIC WORD SUREST RICHARD WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN LACK OF INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE. AND THE CAPACITY IN SERVICE GAPS THAT EXIST WITH THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE SUCH AS MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES THAT ARE MISSING AND THE NUMBER OF CANS. RATHER THAN EXPANDING INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT ADDING HOSPITAL BEDS OR I. M. D. AT A HIGHER COST WHICH WILL ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT VOLUNTARY SERVICE ACCESS CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. TO THAT END WE URGE YOU TO HAVE FOCUSED ANY LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ON ENSURING AND EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WRITER CONCLUDES THE PANEL OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THAT. RIGHT SINGER THANK YOU ALL FOR THE INFORMATION AND YOUR CAR'S. I'VE WORKED THERE. FOR- I'LL GIVE YOU. JUST A FEW SECONDS REAL QUICK IS HOPEFULLY VERY QUICK. TO GO BACK. MMHM YOUR MICROPHONE'S NOT ON. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT THE MAYOR SAID THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING BOLD I AGREE WITH THE MAYOR AND I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO JUSTIFYING BOLD BROADLY DON'T LIMIT IT TO LPS REFORMATORY BROADLY WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH LONG TERM MENTAL ILLNESS OPS REFORM IS A SMALL PIECE OF A MUCH BIGGER CONVERSATION. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE'RE ALL HUNGRY HUMANS. HAVE OKAY. SO GOOD I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'LL TURN IT BACK. TO YOU DOCTOR. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES ON THIS ON THE PANEL VERY MUCH APPRECIATED MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY- FAIR MAKE DATING'S GOING TO JOIN US HERE. IN PERSON AND THEN- ALSO- DOCTORS DOCTORS HERE AND I'M ON THE- ON THE- REMOTE REMOTE PART OF THIS SO ONCE AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO JUST ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EACH IF YOU COULD THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I'D FOR ADVOCATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN- I WANT TO THANK THE SERGEANTS AND STAFF FOR MAKING THIS A CLEAN SAFE ENVIRONMENT. AND OF THE STAFF OF BOTH COMMITTEES WHO PRODUCED A BACKGROUND PAPER. THAT IS UNPARALLELED- FORTY FIVE FISH PAGES WITH A LOT OF REALLY GOOD BACKGROUND IT IT I THINK ANYBODY WHO'S- BEEN A PART OF THIS HEARING OR IS WATCHING IT FROM AFAR WOULD BENEFIT FROM READING IT- MY COMMENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT. CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN IN THE MORNING I'D SHARE THE KEY CHALLENGE FOR COUNTIES. WHICH WAS A VARIETY OF THINGS BUT FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR PUBLIC GUARDIANS- YOU DON'T. I HAVE THREE SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS UP ONCE SHORT TERM WANT TO MEDIUM TERM ONCE A LONG TERM WHAT I WANT TO KNOW FIRST IS THAT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT ARE INNOVATIVE THAT HELP PEOPLE MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE OUR PILOT PROGRAMS ARE GRANT FUNDED PROGRAMS- ARE. OFTEN OR VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS IN FACT EVEN THE EXPANSION OF LAURA'S LAW- BY SENATOR EGGMAN REALLY HAS EXPANDED THOSE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S TO THE GOOD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS- WAS DONE WITHOUT ANY FUNDING FOR COUNTY IS WILLING TO OPT IN. AND SO I CAN LIST TEN PROGRAMS THE PEER SUPPORT SERVICES- THE IT'S S. B. EIGHTY TWO MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS LARA ALL OF THESE GOOD INNOVATIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING AND SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT- IF WE WANT TO MAKE BIG CHANGES WHO TRULY WANT TO HELP WE NEED THE STATE'S HELP WITH THAT- IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE. MY SHORT TERM. SUGGESTION IS IT OF COURSE COUNTIES ARE IN ANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CASE LOOKS THAT THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH CURRENTLY BEFORE ANY OTHER POLICY CHANGES ARE MADE- THEY'VE NOTED THE INCREASE IN FORENSIC REFERRALS THOSE FROM THE JAILS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL AS- JUST GENERALLY MORE AN INCREASE IN POPULATION AND MORE FOLKS THAT ARE REFERRED FOR AT LEAST INVESTIGATION FOR THIS SO THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION. THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO COULD BE SOMETHING TARGETED FUNDING TO HELP PUBLIC GUARDIANS DEAL WITH THOSE RISING CASELOADS AND IMPROVE CARE. THE MEDIUM TERM AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS AS WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT TODAY THE DATA AND TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY- THE INEQUITIES THAT BEEN MENTIONED HERE TODAY- THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HVE THE STATISTICS. THE FACT THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE EVEN INVOLVED IN THIS HEARING- BELIES THE NEED THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHO WERE TREATING. HOW WE'RE TREATING THEM OF COURSE- MEASURE AND DETERMINE OUTCOMES SO THE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY I CLASSIFY AS A MEDIUM TERM. GOAL IN THAT- IF WE HAD SOME FUNDING AND SOME CLEAR- STANDARDS AND- DATA REQUIRED AND OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE SET FORTH. THEN WE CAN BEGIN MEASURING THAT SO I CLASSIFIED AS MEDIUM TERM. THE LAST PIECE IS A LONG TERM PEACE AND IT'S THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES- THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD TODAY BY EVERY SINGLE PERSON REGARDLESS OF. WHERE THEY STAND ON LPS ISSUES WHICH IS THE NEED FOR HOUSING. OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE IS INVESTMENT IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AS WELL AS- FUNDING FOR SOME MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR OTHER- KINDS OF BETS LIKE BOARDING CARE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN IN THERE- THIS IS A LONG TERM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR. IF NOT TWO OR THREE OR FOUR BEFORE WE REALLY START REAPING. THE REWARDS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS- WITH MORE BAD SAFE PLACES TO PUT THE PEOPLE WE ALL SERVE. WITH THAT IN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. I COULD. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH APPRECIATED WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO DOCTOR SHARON. REMOTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIRS STONE AND WOOD AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS- I DO WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND PULLING THIS LARGE GROUP TOGETHER YOUNG SUCH A BROAD. SET OF INFORMATION- I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE GERALD STEINBERG AND HIS- YOU KNOW. REQUESTED OR SUGGESTED THAT BOLD ACTION- IS NEEDED I THINK IT'S DEMANDED BY THE SITUATION- I WANT TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE- BILL IS SOME SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT I DISCUSSED THIS MORNING- THE STANDARD- WHICH- REALLY FOR ME IS A IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT GRADE DISABILITY. THE NEED FOR TOOLS OF ENGAGEMENT AND THEN- THAT THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES TO DELIVER TO OF ANYONE THAT'S GOING TO RECEIVE. ANY TYPE OF- COMPELLED ENGAGEMENT- THE FIRST THING IS REALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT- LPS LAW THE ORIGINAL. LANGUAGE REALLY REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH GOOD DISABILITY- SAY BUT A LARGER PLATFORM OF THE INABILITY TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY DUE TO A SERIOUS. MENTAL ILLNESS AND AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT CARE- I BELIEVE THAT THAT WORKS IN THE ACUTE OR EMINENT SENSE IN TERMS OF SOMEONE BEING HOMICIDAL OR SUICIDAL. DEMOCRATIC SENSE IT DOES NOT WORK THAT'S ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS REALLY AT THE CORE TOPIC. OF CONVERSATION TODAY AND THEIR NUMBER REASONS FOR THAT- INTERPRETATION OF THE INDICATORS OF GREAT DISABILITY OTHER WHICH YOU SEE SHOWS UP IN VARIABLE IMPLEMENTATION. THINGS LIKE DATA BEING LIMITED FOR THE COURTS AND FOR THE JUDGES I'M AND THE JURIES- THE YOUR LACK OF INPUT FROM CARE GIVERS WHICH WE JUST HEARD ABOUT I WHICH IS A PROBLEM. AND REALLY WHAT WE END UP SEEING IS- IT. FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WHICH LEAD TO MULTIPLE ADMISSIONS FOR INPATIENT CARE WHICH IS ACTUALLY FOR ACUTE SERVICES AND- GREAT DISABILITY OR NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY ARE CHRONIC. EARNS AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN YOU PUT SOMEONE INTO THE HOSPITAL THAT CAN BE TOXIC EXPERIENCE A TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE ALSO WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF BEDS OR BEDS ARE ALL JAMS AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS THAT THE ACUTE SERVICES. AND WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND FRANKLY THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CAN'T DRAW DOWN MONEY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN WITH CHRONIC. CONDITIONS IN FACT THIS MAY BE A CONTROVERSIAL THING TO SAY BUT IF IT WERE UP TO ME I WOULD CONSIDER STRIKING GREAT DISABILITY FROM THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY BECAUSE GREAT DISABILITY DOES NOT INDICATE AN IMMINENT- CUTE. SCENARIO SO I'M- ARGUING FOR A REVISITING XIN OF WHAT LIVING SAFELY MEANS. THESE ARE THREE INDICATORS I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MORE. AND THAT WHEN WE IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT LIVING SAFE IN THE COMMUNITY. FOR REASONS- RELATED TO THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS AND AYE AYE AND WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT CARE. WE NEED A PROPER SET OF TOOLS THAT'S BROADER. THAN JUST A CONSERVATORSHIP AND GUARANTEED RESOURCES IN TERMS OF THE TOOLS OF ENGAGED I MENTION OF THEM THIS MORNING. SHARE DECISION MAKING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES THE L. T. PROGRAM I WANT TO SALUTE CENTER EGGMAN FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND THE TEMPORARY AND A FULL CONSERVATORSHIP- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH A- FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND IS THAT THERE'S NO LINKAGE AFTER. A FIFTY ONE FIFTIES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OTHER TOOLS. AND IT CAN'T BE ALL OR NOTHING. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT A BODY OF LAW IS NEEDED TO CAN'T BE ENGINEERED AS ONE OFFS- THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR I WOULD SUGGEST THE LAWMAKERS TO THINK ABOUT. IN TERMS OF GUARANTEED RESOURCES UP FRONT- CIVIL LIBERTIES COMPEL US TO GUARANTEE RESOURCES BEFORE WE MESS WITH ANYBODY'S- CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT RESEARCH THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HOUSING OF ALL TYPES NOT JUST PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT ALSO CONGREGATE HOUSING BOARDING CHAIRS FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE'S A HUGE PROBABLY BOARDING HAS WHICH ARE DISAPPEARING OFF THE FACE OF A CALIFORNIA FOREVER IDEA REASONS THEY'RE NO LONGER AFFORDABLE. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY REAL ACCOUNTABLE AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. RE ENGINEERING- ARE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP APPROACH- AND WE'VE DONE THAT IN PART- COLLABORATING WITH- THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION- RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. A PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION AND INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT CARE ANY CONSERVATIVE WHO I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WAS RECOVERY FACILITATOR BECAUSE OUR GOAL. WITH AN ENGAGEMENT TOOLS IS TO GET PEOPLE ON IT RECOVERY PATHWAY SO THAT THEY DON'T NEED ANY ENGAGEMENT TOOLS IN THAT THEY'RE WILLINGLY ACCEPTING KERR. AND I WOULD ALSO ADD APPEARS SOMEONE WHO. PROVIDES KINSHIP TO INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTEN ISOLATED IN ON THAT BUT ON THE ISSUE OF CONSERVATORSHIP I FULLY AGREE WITH GETTING MORE FUNDING. I APPRECIATE- SCARLET HUES OF THE BIG FAN I WILL SAY HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO MENTION THE WHOLE PILOT WHICH WE'RE DOING WHICH SAVES MONEY. OUR OWN PILOT IS BASED ON GUARANTEED RESOURCES AND RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT WE HEARD THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED FORTY TIMES BEFORE THEY'LL ACCEPT HERE THAT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY ACCURATE- ESTIMATE IN MY OPINION. BUT AFTER AND RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT FAILS WITH GUARANTEED RESOURCES. THE LIST OF WHICH I JUST WENT THROUGH WE DON'T HAVE THINK ABOUT STEP INTO. THE USE OF TO. WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED IN REAL TIME- I CAN HEAR THAT I'VE EXPIRED JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND IF YOU DON'T MIND. DISTRICT REALITY OF SOMEONE WHO IS REFUSING CARE AND HAS SUFFERED IS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE PERSISTENT ELEMENTS. NEEDS TO BE VISIBLE TO THE COURT AND TO THE JUDGE AND WITH OUR HOME PILOT. WE ARE DOING THIS WORK IN THE STREET THAT'S THE CLINICAL WORK THAT I DO VERY VERY RARELY BUT WE'RE PRESENTING CASES TO THE COURTS. BASED ON SOMEONE LIVING ON THE STREET AND NOT ACCEPTING KERR AS OPPOSED TO BEING PUT INTO A HOSPITAL FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. MEDICATED ETCETERA AND THEN RELEASED WORK CONCERNED AT GREAT COST TO OUR SYSTEM OUR TAXPAYERS AND IN MY OPINION TO INDIVIDUALS. IN TERMS OF GENERAL OUTCOMES ARE THE- THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT- TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WE NEED TO BE FUNDED FLEXIBLY TO GO AFTER THOSE. OUTCOMES AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT HOW FUNDING COULD BE USED I'VE MENTIONED MHSAA WHICH IN MY OPINION NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED. AND ALLOW WE NEED TO BE ALLOWED TO USE IT MUCH MORE FLEXIBLY TO ACHIEVE GOALS AT THE STATE THE FINES. AND WE COULD DEFINE THIS POPULATION AS OUR TOP PRIORITY AND USE THAT MONEY TO GO AFTER IT WITH OR WITHOUT ENGAGEMENT TOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH M. BOTH OF YOU AGAIN- COMMENTS MUCH APPRECIATED- HAS PUT ALL OF OUR WITNESSES TODAY.

TODAY WE KNOW THAT PSYCHOSIS LIKE STROKE NEEDS IMMEDIATE MENTAL MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO STOP WHITE BRAIN MATTER DETERIORATION- IT'S LIKE A BRAIN ATTACK. LPS PREVENTS THIS INTERVENTION FOR OUR SICKEST WHO ARE UNABLE THEY'RE NOT IN DENIAL THEY ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY CANNOT DO TO COGNITIVE CHANGES SEEK HELP VOLUNTARILY. THIS HAS LED TO THE TERRIBLE SUFFERING OF THOSE AFFLICTED THEIR FAMILIES IN OUR SOCIETY MILLIONS HAVE DIED NEEDLESSLY JUST BECAUSE THEY CAME INTO THE WORLD WITH TREATABLE NO FAULT BRAIN DISEASES THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED TO GO UNTREATED. IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING PERSONAL RIGHT TO DIE A TERRIBLE DEATH JUST QUICKLY LPS WAS BUILT ON A FAULTY FOUNDATION RIDDLED WITH NON MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE RIGHT TO TREATMENT BEFORE TRAGEDY WE MUST REBUILD THE LEGISLATION WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION BASED ON THE MEDICAL TREATMENT THE MEDICAL NEED FOR TREATMENT.
