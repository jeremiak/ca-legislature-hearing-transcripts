WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE. THE

00:05:59.092 --> 00:05:59.959
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY HAS

OVER A HALF MILLION REGISTERED

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.294

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.794
CALIFORNIA MINOR PARTIES

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:06.666

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.868
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MARK

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:09.769
SEIDENBERG KNOWLEDGE THAT

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.871
VOTERS ARE BEING CONFUSED BY

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:13.973
SAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.574
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.642
DOING WHEN THEY FILL OUT A FORM

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:17.977
MR SEIDENBERG WENT ON TO SAY

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.846
THAT ONE REASON THE AMERICAN

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.047
INDEPENDENT PARTY DOES NOT WANT

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.982
TO CHANGE ITS NAME IS THAT THE

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.583
PARTY WOULD BE FORCED TO GET

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.450
NEW VOTERS AND THAT'S

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.954
EXPENSIVE. AND IT WOULD HAVE TO

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.454
GET NEW WORDS PRESUMABLY

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.424
BECAUSE- VOTERS WHO ACTUALLY

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.725
UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMERICAN

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.761
PAN PARTY IS NOT. REALLY A

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.929
PARTY OF INDEPENDENCE WOULD

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.631
LEAVE THAT PARTY IN RE REGISTER

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:42.235

IDENTIFY THE POLITICAL PARTY.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.823
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.691
IS ROOTED IN KIND OF IGNORANCE

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.259

NOT ABOUT TO CHANGE ITS NAME SO.

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:22.655
ONE ISSUE IS THAT THEY SAY THAT

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:26.926
THE WE HAVE TO HAVE. A

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.594

WE COULD EVEN CALL CONVENTION.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:56.822

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:57.590
BOTTOM LINE IS OUR PARTY IS NOT

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:01.727

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:12.671
HAVE FOUR POINTS. THE FIRST IS

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.940
GIVEN THE TIMING IN THIS BILL

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.143
IT VIOLATES DUE PROCESS THE

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.145
SECOND POINT IS THE LAW THE

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:21.347
BILL IS VAGUE. IT DOESN'T

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:24.984
CLEARLY SPECIFY WHICH WORDS ARE

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.853
PROHIBITED. THE THIRD IS. THERE

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.756
ARE MANY. OKAY I'VE I'VE ASKED

PUT A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:37.296
OF YOU. THIS SHOWS THAT FORTY

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.731
SEVEN OF THE FIFTY STATES AT

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:40.399
ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. IT HAD A

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.602
PARTY OF QUALIFIED PARTY WITH

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:44.203
THE WORD EITHER INDEPENDENT OR

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.673
INDEPENDENCE. SOME GROUPS WANT

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.275
CALIFORNIA TO SECEDE FROM THE

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:51.577
UNITED STATES. THIS BILL I

HOPE THE AUTHOR WILL CORRECT

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:59.452
ME. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.886
SUCH A PARTY O DESCRIBE ITS

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:02.755
MISSION IF THE WORD

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:06.559
INDEPENDENCE. IS NOT PERMITTED.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.126
AND THE FOURTH IS THIS BILL

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:11.097
VIOLATES. THE FIRST AMENDMENT

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:13.599
OF ALMOST IDENTICAL LAW WAS

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.034
DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN

IS TICKING AND THERE ARE FAR

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:23.075
BETTER WAYS TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.145
IT'S MUCH KINDER TO MAKE THINGS

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:27.680
LIKE THIS VOLUNTARY TWELVE

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:30.749

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.485
NAME. EVEN THE TWO MAJOR

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.386
PARTIES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:36.155
THAT MINNESOTA THE DEMOCRATIC

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.090
PARTY CHANGED ITS NAME TO

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.025
DEMOCRATIC FARMER LABOR. THE

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.828
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN NINETEEN

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:43.429
SEVENTY FOUR CHANGED ITS NAME

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.396
TO THE INDEPENDENT REPUBLICAN

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.499
PARTY SALAS SWITCHED BACK.

LET ANY PARTY CHANGED ITS NAME

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:54.773
JUST AS OREGON DOES DOES THE SO

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.043
WHY DOES. IF YOU DON'T FORCE

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.644
THEM TO CHANGE THEIR NAME THEY

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.881
MIGHT. FREE LEE COME UP WITH A

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.784
NAME THEY LIKE. AND FINALLY

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:08.020
IT'S SO SIMPLE TO JUST HAVE A

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:08.721
CHOICE ON THE VOTER

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.090
REGISTRATION CARD THAT SAYS I

PROBLEM WHEN THEY MISS REGISTER

PARCEL TAXES IN BONDS. THE

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.481
REQUIRED A VOTERS BE INFORMED

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.081
ABOUT QUOTE UNQUOTE WHAT THEY

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.617
WILL HAVE TO PACK. AT ON THE

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.487
SURFACE THAT MAKES ALL THE

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:02.087
SENSE IN THE WORLD AND I VOTED

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:03.822
FOR THE ONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.125
BUT THERE WERE. SIGNIFICANT

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.560
UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:09.862
CHANGE BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.765
SEEMS SO SIMPLE. IS NOT. I AM

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:13.766
THERE TO SIGNIFICANT

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:16.502
CONSEQUENCES FIRST. IF YOU ARE

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.970
TRYING TO PASS A TIERED PARCEL

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.572
TAX. WHERE SENIORS GOT AN

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.374
EXEMPTION WERE OUTSIDE PAYS

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:25.244
LESS. WORK COMMERCIAL PAYS MORE

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.346
THAN RESIDENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE.

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:30.082
IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.550
FIT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:35.387
INTO SEVENTY FIVE WORDS.AND

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:35.988
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UNDER

00:17:36.054 --> 00:17:37.956
THE STATE OF THE LAW RIGHT NOW.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.458
TIERED PARCELTAXES PROGRESSIVE

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.360
PARCEL TAXES ARE BANNED

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:44.596
EFFECTIVELY. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.598
FIT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.066
THAT MEANS ALL PARCEL TAXES

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.536
WILL HAVE TO BE A ONE FLAT RATE

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.638
REGRESSIVE EVERYONE PAYS THE

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.340
SAME PARCEL TAX THAT IS NOT

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:57.910
FAIR IT'S NOT GOOD POLICY IN

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:00.412
ADDITION FOR BONDS ALL RIGHT

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.582
BECAUSE AT THE TIME THE VOTERSVOTE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:06.351
TERMS OF THE BOND ISSUE ARE

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:06.952
GOING TO BE WHAT THE INTEREST

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.587
RATE IS GOING TO BE. ARE YOU

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.022
DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.790
GOING TO PAY AND SO WE'RE

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.192
FORCING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.027
TO SPECULATE. AND GIVE AN

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.262
ESTIMATE OR RANGE WHICH MAY BE

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:19.164
INACCURATE AND MISLEADING

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:21.133
PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.134
ACTUALLY BE PAYING. ON THE

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.570
BOND. SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.872
HERE IT INTO SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.307
ONLY A BROAD COALITION OF LOCAL

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:30.375
GOVERNMENTS AND LABOR AND

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.510
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUPS

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:34.213
BEHIND THIS MEASURE. IS NOT TO

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.248
REPEAL BUT TO MOVE THIS

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.616
INFORMATION INTO THE VOTER

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:41.787
GUIDE. AND TO REQUIRE. FOR THE

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.289
FIRST TIME A PARENTHETICAL IN

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.624
THE SEVENTY FIVE WORK QUESTION

INFORMATION. GO TO THE VOTER

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.705
GUIDE AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.441
STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE IN TREND

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:04.343
HAVING TRANSPARENCY NOT

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.178
MISLEADING VOTERS NOT BANNING

FACILITIES. IT IS CRITICALLY

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.066
IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE

CHANGES TO THE ELECTIONS CODE

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.277

MORE DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS.

HOUSE ALL STUDENTS I'M AND IT

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.052
IS PREVENTING SCHOOLS FROM

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.420
BEING ABLE TO FORWARD WITH

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.022
PLACING BONDS ON THEIR LOCAL

DO CHANGE AND ONE EXAMPLE THAT

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.597
WE LOOKED AT. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.865

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:07.933
DOLLARS PER ONE HUNDRED

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.467

YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.746
SPREAD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.347
THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT MAKE

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:25.250

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.678
PASSIONATE ABOUT. THE SECTION

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:14.379
OF THE STATE CODE THAT I'VE

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:15.947
BEEN WORKING IN FIVE YEARS IN

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:18.016
FACT. BOTH OF THE PIECES OF

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.084
LEGISLATION THAT THIS THE

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.752
AUTHOR REFERENCE WERE MY BILLS

THESE TYPES OF BOND ISSUANCES

FROM THE GARMENTS THAT WE

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.260
CREATED COLLECTIVELY IN THE

LEGISLATURE. FOUR YEARS AGO.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:31.429
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.131
NOT THAT THERE AREN'T PROBLEMS

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.599
THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED WITH THE

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:37.636
LANGUAGE FOR THESE BONDS. ARE

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:38.737
ONE AB ONE NINETY FIVE PASSED

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:39.304
TWO YEARS AGO IT WAS

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.406
IMMEDIATELY CLEAR. THAT SOME

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:42.507
SITUATIONS HAD NOT BEEN

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:43.608
ADEQUATELY THOUGHT OUT FOR

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.143
EXAMPLE. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.946
WHEN. A TEAR TAXES IMPOSED WHAT

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:48.980
SHOULD BE DONE WHEN THE

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.081
INTEREST RATE OR THE DURATION

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:51.383
OF A BOND IS NOT KNOWN. WHEN

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.384
THE ISSUE WAS PLACED ON THE

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.252
BALLOT. HOWEVER COLLEAGUES FOR

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.687
THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:57.289
AUTHORED LEGISLATION EACH YEAR

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:58.523
TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THOSE

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.891
PROBLEMS AND WHAT IS BECOME

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.459
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. IS THAT THE

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.328
SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ARE NOT

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.297
INTERESTED. IN MERELY FIXING

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.698
THE PROBLEM AND CONDENSING THE

00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:07.732
LANGUAGE ON THE BALLOT

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:08.833
STATEMENT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.835
TO DO. IS TO AVOID HAVING TO

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.170
TELL THE VOTERS THAT THEY'RE

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.505
VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE. AND

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.340
IF YOU WANT PROOF OF THAT. I

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.608
HAVE HERE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.642
THEY'VE BEEN DRAFTED BY LEDGE

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:18.777
COUNCIL WHAT THEY DO IS THEY

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:20.111
SAY THEY COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:22.113
THE SENATOR. THEY SAY LET'S

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.915
MOVE ALL OF THE LANGUAGE ABOUT

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:26.117
THE RATE INFORMATION ON TO. THE

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.519
VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE WHERE

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:30.155
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. TO

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.089
LISTED AND INSTEAD LET'S JUST

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.191
SAY THISLET'S SAY. THIS

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.660
MEASURE INCREASES PROPERTY

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:40.398
TAXES. SEE VOTER GUIDE. DOESN'T

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.099
TAKE UP MUCH SPACE ALL IT DOES

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:41.733
IS MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT VOTING

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.334
ON THIS MEASURE WILL INCREASE

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.668
PROPERTY TAXES IF INDEED THAT

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:44.402
IS THE CASE THAT IS NOT

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:45.637
CONFUSING. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:47.505
TRUE AND I THINK IT ENCOMPASSES

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:48.606
THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL'S

00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:50.041
SPONSOR HOWEVER WE OFFER THESE

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.676
AMENDMENTS IN. THE ASSEMBLY

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:52.577
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THEY

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:53.945
WERE SUMMARILY REJECTED BY THE

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.547
BILL'S SPONSOR. I THINK THAT

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:57.816
THAT PROVES WHAT THE ACTUAL

00:26:57.882 --> 00:27:01.486
INTENT IS. UP. THE OTHER THING

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:02.420
I'D LIKE TO SAY HERE IS THAT

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:04.222
THIS MEASURE. IS A COMPLETELY

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.324
UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IF THE

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:07.592
PROPONENTS OF THE BILL BELIEVE

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:10.161
VOTERS ARE CONFUSED. THEN IT WE

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:12.030
SHOULD HAVE LOTS OF THESE BOND

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:12.931
MEASURES THAT ARE BEING PLACED

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.766
ON THE BALLOT AND FAILING. AND

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:15.867
THAT IS NOT THE CASE I LOOKED

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:17.569
AT ALL OF THE BOND MEASURES

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.270
STATEWIDE THAT WERE PROPOSED IN

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:20.372
THE LAST TWO YEAR ELECTION

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:22.340
CYCLE. AND YOU KNOW THE PASSAGE

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:23.575
RATE WAS ALL OF THEM COMPLIED

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.176
WITH AB ONE NINETY FIVE. THE

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:27.679
PASSAGE RATE WAS OVER 82% SO

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:28.880
IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT VOTERS

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:29.848
ARE NOT CONFUSED BY THESE

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:31.683
EXTINCT EXISTING LANGUAGE. SO

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.184
OUR I HAVE GIVEN THE SERGEANT

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:34.919
ARMS A LITTLE HAND OUT TO PASS

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.554
OUT TO YOU. THIS BILL WAS A

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:38.456
LAST MINUTE GOT AMEND A HOWEVER

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:40.258
IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:40.925
SINCE THE BILL HAS BEEN IN

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:43.194
PRINT. WE HAVE HAD EDITORIAL

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.929
BOARDS OF NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:45.997
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE HE

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.400
AND ON THIS BILL. AND THE

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:51.036
FEEDBACK HAS NOT BEEN KIND. AND

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:55.407
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FROM ALL

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:55.974
DIFFERENT POLITICAL STRIPES

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.409
BIG. OUTLETS LIKE LOS ANGELES

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:57.942
TIMES SERVICES WE CANNOT

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:58.643
CHRONICLE SAN DIEGO UNION

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.445
TRIBUNE. THE US SACRAMENTO BEE

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.880
AND THEY'RE USING WORDS LIKE.

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:07.719
SNEAKY DISHONEST DESPICABLE. A

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:09.187
AND ALSO LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:10.088
TO MY FAVORITE PART OF THE BILL

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:11.289
WHICH I HAVE NOT A LOT OF

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.024
ATTENTION ACTUALLY THERE'S ONLY

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:13.658
ONE OF THE EDITORIALS THERE THE

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:15.126
MENTIONS IT BUT IT'S ANOTHER

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.262
CHANGE THAT THE BILL WOULD BEG

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:18.830
TO THE LANGUAGE OF AB ONE

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.065
NINETY FIVE SAYS THIS FAILURE

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:21.566
TO COMPLY WITH THIS CHAPTER

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.001
SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:24.402
OF EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING A

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:26.604
BOND ISSUE FELLING THE SALE AND

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:27.405
DELIVERY OF A BONDS OR A TAX

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:28.973
FOLLOWING ITS INITIAL

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.975
IMPOSITION SO BASICALLY WHAT

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:31.743
THAT MEANS IS WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.378
CHANGE THE RULES THERE STILL BE

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:33.945
RIPPLES. BUT WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:34.579
GIVE ANYONE WITH A MEASURE ON

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.648
THE FAT FREE PASS IF THEY DON'T

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:38.083
FOLLOW THE RULES THE ACTION

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:39.684
THAT THEY TOOK IS STILL VALID

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.952
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.187
COMPLETELY WRONG SO I WOULD ASK

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.255
YOU COLLEAGUES IF YOU WOULD

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.824
VOTE NO ON THIS OR AT THE VERY

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:46.891
LEAST I THINK THAT THIS NEEDS

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:49.060
TO BE A TO YOUR BILL I DON'T

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:49.894
THINK IT SHOULD BE A LAST

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.262
MINUTE GOT DEMAND THAT HERE

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.364
WERE CONSIDERING THE DAY BEFORE

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:55.467
THE END OF SESSION I THINK WE

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:58.269
NEED TO HAVE A REASON

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.205
THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:00.772
THIS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:03.608
SUCH AN- ON A TRIP. BALLOT

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:04.109
LEAPING IN THE STATE OF

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:12.183
CALIFORNIA. CONSIDERING USE. MR

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:12.784
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING

JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION

WE'RE OPPOSED TO SB TWO SIXTY

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.054
EIGHT TODAY MEMBERS IT'S WORTH

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:16.955
NOTING WE WERE THE SPONSORS OF

00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:18.056
A SOME WOMEN OBERNOLTE IS TWO

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:19.124
BILLS AT THAT HE REFERENCE

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.192
DURING HIS TESTIMONY AND

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.393
MEMBERS WHAT'S FRUSTRATING

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.329
ABOUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:26.164
THAT WE TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:29.033
THING WE KNEW FULL WELL THAT

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.469
LOCAL BONDS EVEN AS THE SENATOR

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:32.804
MENTIONED WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:35.473
HARD TIME COMPLYING WITH THE

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.542
BALLOT LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT AB

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:40.612
ONE NINETY FIVE WE- FOR THREE

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:41.146
YEARS TO FIND LANGUAGE. TO

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:44.149
EXEMPT THAT. AND TAKE CARE OF

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:45.583
IT. ALSO AND I MEAN I PRESENTED

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.352
LANGUAGE TO THE AUTHOR EVEN AS

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:50.522
EARLY AS THE LAST MONTH TO THE

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:53.291
AUTHOR STAFF. TO SAY. TO USE

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:54.425
EVEN THE PHRASE MAY INCREASE

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:56.127
YOUR PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE THE

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.195
AUTHOR IS RIGHT IN HIS

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.531
PRESENTATION. WHEN BONDS ARE

00:29:59.597 --> 00:30:00.999
PASSED NOT EVERY YEAR PROPERTY

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:02.534
TAXES GO UP AS A RESULT THE

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.170
BONDS BONDS ARE SOLD IN CYCLES.

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.838
AND AT DIFFERENT RATES AND

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.306
ROUTINE SO IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.941
THAT PROPERTY TAXES WILL GO UP

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:11.309
YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:12.744
FUN SO WE DID BECAUSE THE

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.646
MOMENT THAT SAY. IT MAY

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.947
INCREASE YOUR PROPERTY TAXES TO

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.782
THE AUTHOR STAFF AND THAT WAS

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:18.983
SUMMARILY REJECTED AND NOT

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.019
HEARD SO I MEAN WE'VE- SPENT

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:23.188
YEARS AND YEARS TRYING TO BEND

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:26.558
OVER BACKWARDS. TO ACCOMMODATE.

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:28.393
THIS PROPOSAL THE CHANGES THAT

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.261
NEEDED TO BE MADE AGAIN OUT OF

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.896
A DESIRE TO GIVE VOTERS

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.999
ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. AND

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:36.234
UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL BEFORE

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:37.602
US GOES FAR BEYOND THE

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.004
NECESSARY FIX. AND YOU KNOW WE

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:40.972
WOULD ARGUE REPRESENTS ABROAD

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:43.341
OVER A PRIOR OVERREACH.

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:45.443
TRANSPARENCIES DIMINISHED AND

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.477
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT HELD

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:49.447
TO ACCOUNT IF SPECIAL TAXES ARE

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.183
REMOVED FROM THE BALLOT LABEL.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.619
VOTERS DESERVE BETTER. AND I

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:57.956
JUST HEARD BACK TO. WHAT SOME

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:59.123
WOMEN MENTIONED IN HIS

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.026
TESTIMONY. IS THE BILL EVEN

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:07.665
NOW. 82% OF ALL BOND TAXES

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.067
PASSED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS IN

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:11.936
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M WITH THEM

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:19.477
FROM WESTERN ABOUT. IS IT

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:26.150
NECESSARY THANKS. TO REDO IT.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.385
UNLIKE CUSHION I CAN DRAW IS

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:27.919
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SKIRT

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:31.356
TRANSPARENT YET ASK FOR AN OF A.

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:33.157
WELL I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:36.661
WITH THIS BILL IT IS A MAJOR.

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:37.161
RE WRITE IF YOU WILL OF

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:41.566
LEGISLATION THAT DID PASS. AND

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:45.003
AT THE LEAST SUCH CHANGES.

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:45.603
OUGHT NOT BE OCCURRING AT THE

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.706
LAST MINUTE. AND THERE OUGHT TO

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:49.841
BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:52.110
THE CITIZENS. OF CALIFORNIANS

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:54.312
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO OFTEN

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:54.879
THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AROUND

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:56.914
HERE. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.383
HAPPENING IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:31:58.449 --> 00:32:00.685
BILL HERE AND IT SEEMS TO ME

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:01.252
THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.888
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE AFRAID. OF

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.757
THE CITIZENS HAVING FULL.

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:08.526
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND I

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.328
SPEAK IS THE LONG TIME CHAMPION

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:13.131
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AROUND HERE.

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.532
BUT THEY LIKE TO BE INSULATED

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.667
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BILL THAT

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:17.468
JUST WAS UP YESTERDAY THAT

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:21.572
ALLOWS THE LOCAL ENTITY TO IN

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:24.842
FACT TECH IT'S VOTERS. TO CRAFT

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.377
THE LINES OF THE VOTE. UNDER

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:30.448
PROPOSITION. TO THE VANTAGE OF

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:33.685
PASSING THAT PROPOSITION IN

00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:34.252
THEIR COMMUNITY IT'S RATHER

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.189
TAXING. A COUPLE COUNTIES WHEN

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:38.790
I REPRESENT AND WHEN I USED TO

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:39.857
REPRESENT. THAT'S VOTER

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:43.561
SHOPPING. I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.562
WHERE WE OUGHT TO DO BUSINESS

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.297
THIS BILL DESERVES A LOT MORE

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.232
SCRUTINY A LOT MORE TIME. I

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:52.136
CANNOT SUPPORT. THANK YOU

00:32:52.203 --> 00:32:56.040
NIELSEN HERTZBERG. WHY IS ALL

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:58.910
THESE NEWSPAPERS JUST BRUTALIZE

BALLOT HOW BOOK WHICH IS THE

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:31.662
CORE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. WHAT

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:35.533
WE WANTED THE PARENTHETICAL TO

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.768

40% OF CALPERS INTO A RENTERS

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:46.344
YOU DON'T PAY PROPERTY TAXES.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.213
AND ALSO FALLS IF YOU HAVE A

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.548
PRO A PARCEL TAX THAT YOU WERE

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.749
SIMPLY EXTENDING AT THIS RATE

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:54.085
IT'S NOT RAISE YOUR TAXES. AND
