BUT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE

02:10:02.394 --> 02:10:04.429
POLICY COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:05.931
THIS IS A VERY DEFENSIBLE BILL

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:08.133
CONSTITUTIONALLY WE ARE IN A

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.370
UNIQUE- HEALTH PANDEMIC. THAT

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.005

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:15.541
CONSEQUENCES AND WE HAVE THE

02:10:15.607 --> 02:10:17.910
ABILITY AS A LEGISLATURE- TO

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:20.312

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:22.047
ARE GOING TO REMOVE THE LEASE

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:23.615
TERMINATION PROVISION REPLACE

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:25.651
IT WITH SOMETHING SOFTER- WE

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.553
ARE TRYING TO RESPOND TO SOME

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:30.522
OF THE CONCERNS. ON IN TERMS OF

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:31.957

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:34.059
BEEN MEANT. NONE OF US WANTS

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.994
ANY OF THESE LANDLORDS LARGE OR

02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:38.931

02:10:44.836 --> 02:10:48.340
BUILT. GIVEN THE FEATHER JURY

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:53.779
OVER SO MANY THE MORE IS THERE.

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:56.815
REGULATE IT'S HARD ENOUGH SPLIT.

02:10:56.882 --> 02:10:57.950
FEDERAL AND STATE SO WE ARE

02:10:58.016 --> 02:10:59.084
DOING A WE TIME BUT I THINK

02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:00.285
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN.

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:02.955
THE IT IS NOT CASE. THAT THESE.

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:04.723
LANDLORDS ARE JUST PEACHY KEEN

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:06.592
RIGHT EVERY IS ALL GOOD

02:11:06.658 --> 02:11:07.993
EVERYONE'S PAYING THEIR RENT

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.695
AND YOU KNOW SCOTT WIENER

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:11.296
LEANING AND SALAS COME ALONG

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.765
AND SAY WE THINK THEY SHOULD

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:14.633
PAY REDUCE RIGHT. THEY'RE NOT

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:17.302
GETTING THE RENT OVERWHELMINGLY

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:19.171
RIGHT NOW. AND SO THIS BILL

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:20.939
DISAPPEAR TOMORROW IT'S NOT

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:22.441
LIKE THEY WOULD BE COLLECTING

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:24.243
FOR RENT. THOSE BUSINESSES ARE

02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:26.111
JUST GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THE

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:27.512
CHOICE FOR SO MANY OF THESE

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:30.315
LANDLORDS IS NOT. DO YOU GET

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.684

ARE JUST GOING TO CLOSE. DOWN

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:41.393
SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.694
THERE'S NO RISK OF LOAN DEFAULT

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.162
ALARIC WE'RE CREATING I THINK

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:48.133

ONLY BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE.

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.742
TO TRY TO ADDRESS WHAT IS

02:11:56.808 --> 02:11:57.976
WHATEVER ONE'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT
