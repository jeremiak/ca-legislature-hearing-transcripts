INCENSED AT NOT BEING ABLE TO

GET THESE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:33.245 region:rollup2
SFPD CAN DO ANYTHING OUR

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:35.080 region:rollup2

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.631 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE. VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.833 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY BE TESTED VERY SAFELY

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.969 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:58.537 region:rollup2
COMING. MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN A

00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:59.538 region:rollup2
LEASE I I THOUGHT.

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.472 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.974 region:rollup2
VERY EXCITING IN THE UP TO IS

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:03.242 region:rollup2
VERY EXCITING WE ALSO WANT TO

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:04.743 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL LAW

00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:06.412 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT HAS EVERY WAITER

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:08.180 region:rollup2
POLICE OF THE STREET TO MAKE

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:11.283 region:rollup2

A VERY PASSED LEGISLATION AYE

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.722 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE TESTING OPERATION

STEP.

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:28.734 region:rollup2

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.412 region:rollup2
TO GETTING IN FRONT OF THE DMV

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:29.214 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO SAY THAT.

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:31.550 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE LEGISLATIVE

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:33.151 region:rollup2
INTENT OF THOSE OF US AS THE

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.419 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BODY GETTING IN

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.420 region:rollup2
FRONT OF THE REGULATORY AND AT

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:37.089 region:rollup2
THAT AT THAT YOU CAN HELP

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.823 region:rollup2
ELABORATE ON THE INSIDE AND

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:40.459 region:rollup2
<u><i>UTSIDE THE COULD LOOK AT THE</i></u>

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:42.361 region:rollup2
GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK I TEND TO.

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:44.329 region:rollup2
ALSO FEEL THAT WAY IN MANY

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:45.664 region:rollup2
CASES I THINK IN THIS CASE WE

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:47.399 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED THIS BILL. A LAST

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.001 region:rollup2
TRIP THIS TIME AND WE ACTUALLY

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.902 region:rollup2
HELD IT THE THE PROVISIONS

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.570 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BILL WERE ACTUALLY

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:53.038 region:rollup2
MUCH STRONGER IN TERMS OF. A

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.874 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ALLOWED LOCAL LAW

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:58.510 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT TO DO US WOULD

00:27:55.874 --> 00:28:00.779 region:rollup2
PURPOSELY WAITED HELD BACK.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:03.315 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SEE WHAT DIEM BE WAS

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:05.217 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO IT WAS OUR HOPE THAT

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:08.053 region:rollup2
DIEM VIEW COULD HAVE RATIFIED

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:09.922 region:rollup2
THESE REGULATIONS LAST YEAR. SO

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:13.192 region:rollup2
A YEAR LATER.

00:28:09.922 --> 00:28:16.428 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ON THEM REGULATIONS

00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:17.930 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THERE IN IN AGREEMENT

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:19.932 region:rollup2
BUT IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:23.135 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY.

00:28:19.932 --> 00:28:26.505 region:rollup2
RATIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENTS I

00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:29.141 region:rollup2
THINK A WEEK VERY RESPECTFUL OF

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:31.577 region:rollup2
WHAT DIEM V. NEEDS TO DO.

00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:35.314 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB BUT I

00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:36.615 region:rollup2
THINK AS A LAWMAKERS WITH TO DO

00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:39.251 region:rollup2
OUR JOB AS WELL TO MAKE SURE

00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:43.655 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PROTECTING OUR

00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:45.691 region:rollup2
CITIZENS OUR STREETS. A DMV AS

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:48.327 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY AND THEY DON'T

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:51.863 region:rollup2
REALLY HEAR OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:28:48.327 --> 00:28:52.831 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COMPLAIN THEY CALL OUR

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:55.167 region:rollup2
OFFICES.

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.701 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:28:55.167 --> 00:29:02.207 region:rollup2
NEEDS HELP CLEAN WITH THE

00:28:55.701 --> 00:29:04.476 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO SEE IF.

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:06.712 region:rollup2
WE CAN FIND AGREEMENT I AND I

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:11.016 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:11.550 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR OBJECTION I THINK

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:12.684 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY REASONABLE THAT

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.822 region:rollup2
WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:17.689 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:22.060 region:rollup2
HOME WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:26.698 region:rollup2
FOREVER FOR THESE REGULATIONS TO

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:28.200 region:rollup2
NOT. HERE TO BE CODIFIED R. MADE

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:30.068 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY'LL NEVER BECOME.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:34.106 region:rollup2
TICKET.

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:36.441 region:rollup2
AB.

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:38.710 region:rollup2
I THINK MR TING FOR FOR BEGIN

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:40.012 region:rollup2
THIS THIS BILL FORWARD UP ARE

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.847 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:43.782 region:rollup2
ALL AGREE THAT THAT WE NEED TO

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:45.150 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE ACT ACTING HAVE THE

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:50.956 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN I

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
RESIDENT. I DID JUST WANNA.

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:54.426 region:rollup2
ECHO SOME THE CONCERNS MADE BY

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:56.528 region:rollup2
MISTER LOW JUST ABOUT THE SORT

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:58.664 region:rollup2
OF POTENTIAL DUPLICATIVE. ARM

00:29:56.528 --> 00:30:02.634 region:rollup2
NATURE.

00:29:58.664 --> 00:30:07.506 region:rollup2
MAYBE ALSO. I'M HAVING A LITTLE

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:10.442 region:rollup2
LESS WITH THEM.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:12.110 region:rollup2
AWHILE AGO SO WASN'T JUST

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:13.578 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE BILL WAS JUST

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.681 region:rollup2
CHANGED IMPRINT ON LAST WEEK BUT

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:18.517 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION THAT WE PUT IN

00:30:15.681 --> 00:30:21.453 region:rollup2
PRINT WAS SHARED WITH THEM.

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:24.790 region:rollup2
AWHILE AGO OF THAT THAT'S WHY WE

00:30:21.453 --> 00:30:26.358 region:rollup2
CHOSE WHO WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.426 region:rollup2
TWO PROVISIONS AROUND LAW

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:29.428 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO THE ONES

00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:30.495 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY WE DON'T ANTICIPATE

00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:32.030 region:rollup2
CHANGING.

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:34.433 region:rollup2
WE WE THINK WHAT'S THESE

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.900 region:rollup2
VEHICLES NEED TO BE DEPLOYED

00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:37.069 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE A LAW

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.004 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PLAN PERHAPS TO BE A

00:30:37.069 --> 00:30:39.771 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT PLANT AND EVERY

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:40.939 region:rollup2
SINGLE ONE OF OUR KITTIES

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.540 region:rollup2
CATHOLIC THE MINIMUM. THE OTHER

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:45.510 region:rollup2
MINIMUM SHOULD BE THAT LAW

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.111 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE INFORMED

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.978 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS TESTING IS GOING TO

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.447 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE.

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:50.282 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN IF THEY NEED TO

00:30:48.447 --> 00:30:50.816 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EXTRA SECURITY ARE THEY

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:52.818 region:rollup2
NEED TO.

00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:54.519 region:rollup2
BE AWARE OF THE SITUATION THAT

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:55.754 region:rollup2
THEY CAN THEY CAN MONITOR BILLY

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.489 region:rollup2
USE THAT AS OUR GUIDES.

00:30:55.754 --> 00:30:59.491 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY ALL THE PROVISIONS

00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:01.560 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CODIFIED SO AGAIN TO

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:04.696 region:rollup2
MEET THE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.098 region:rollup2
FORM THE VERY BASELINE OF SAFETY

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:08.600 region:rollup2
THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM STANDARDS

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:09.501 region:rollup2
SAFETY OBVIOUSLY THE REGULATIONS

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.135 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING CODIFIED DISCUSS

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:12.304 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA BE DOING A WHOLE LOT

00:31:10.135 --> 00:31:14.272 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THAT. BUT THIS TO ME

00:31:12.304 --> 00:31:15.607 region:rollup2
OUR HELPS ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:17.809 region:rollup2
BASELINE OF SAFETY WITH THE

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:20.145 region:rollup2
BASELINE OF A HAVING THESE

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:21.380 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WORK DIRECTLY WITH

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:23.181 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH I

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.317 region:rollup2
THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:26.485 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE PRIMARY

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:27.919 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WITH DMV.

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:28.854 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NOT ANY OBLIGATION

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.522 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BUT LOCAL LAW

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:31.790 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SO THIS DISQUALIFIES

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:34.359 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.594 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU BE

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.428 region:rollup2

00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:38.463 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK WITH DMB BUT THAT YOU

HANDED AND HAVING A PLAN WITH

00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:42.901 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAW FIRST BECAUSE IN THE

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:43.268 region:rollup2
END THEY'RE THE ONES CHARGED

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:45.237 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:47.639 region:rollup2

YES I AM.

00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:55.547 region:rollup2

HOW DO THEY RESPOND TO THESE

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:11.163 region:rollup2
ACCIDENTS ON THE FREEWAY OR
