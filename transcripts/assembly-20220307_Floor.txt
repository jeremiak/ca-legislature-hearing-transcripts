THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE FORTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA RELATIVE TO WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK. MISTER SEA AT EMAIL THANK YOU MEMBERS AS CHAIR THE LEGISLATIVE WOMAN'S CAUCUS I AM PROUD TO AUTHOR ACR ONE FORTY SIX WHICH IN PLANES MARCH SEVENTH THAT SEE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK. THIS RESOLUTION CELEBRATES WOMEN AFTER A CRUCIAL PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND SEEKS TO ENCOURAGE POLICYMAKERS AND INDUSTRIES TO ADOPT POLICIES THAT WILL SUCCESSFULLY INCREASED WOMAN AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO ELIMINATE THE NUMEROUS DISPARITIES LIMON FAITH IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. BY RAISING AWARENESS OF GENDER INEQUITIES WOMEN COMPROMISED COMPRISE ONLY 6% OF APPRENTICES AND UNDER 10% OF CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- AT THE START OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE. ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE UP 47% OF THE US POPULATION TODAY. TODAY FOR EVERY FIVE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR RETIREMENT THERE'S ONLY ONE IN THE PIPELINE TO REPLACE THEM. ACR ONE FORTY SIX AND RECOGNIZES WOMEN F. AN UNTAPPED RESOURCE TO HELP CLOSE THE SKILLED LABOR GAP TO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP PACE WITH AND INFRASTRUCTURAL NEEDS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS YOU MUST EDUCATE AND INSPIRE PEOPLE ABOUT THE REWARDING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN CONSTRUCTION AND THE TRAITS WITHOUT STUDENT LOAN DEBTS AND THAT INCLUDES WOMEN. CONVINCING WOMEN THEY CAN THRIVE IN CONSTRUCTION AND THAT THE TRADES WILL TREAT THEM WELL REPRESENTS A SHIFT IN THE MINDSET THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IT TAKES TIME AND ADVOCACY AND OF COURSE PERSISTENCE. ACR ONE FORTY SIX HOUSES BUILD AWARENESS AND EMPHASIZE THE GROWING ROLE THAT WOMEN PLAY IN CONSTRUCTION AND THE TRADES BUILDING CAREERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROCESS AND STRIVE FOR MORE EQUITY IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRIES. I DO WANT TO THANK THE WOMEN WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE LEAD TO TWO IN THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD AND ARE PAVING THE WAY FOR SO MANY OTHER WOMEN OUT THERE AND BE IN THE ROLE MODELS THAT WE ALL NEED TODAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SIMMONS QUIRK-SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS WHEN YOU THINK OF AN INDUSTRY DOMINATED BY MEN CONSTRUCTION MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FIRST THAT COMES TO MIND. WE KNOW WE HAVE ALL THOSE MEN THAT HAVE A STRONG AND HARD WORKING BUT GUESS WHAT WOMEN ARE TOO. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT LESS THAN 10% OF WOMEN ARE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OR TRADES WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK IS A TIME TO CELEBRATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOMEN HAVE MADE TO THE INDUSTRY AND ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO CONSIDER JOINING THE FILLED. UNTRADED WOMEN TO PROJECT MANAGERS TO BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. WOMEN ENJOY A WIDE RANGE OF ROLES IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. HOWEVER OUTDATED PERCEPTIONS STILL EXISTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION NOT JUST AMONGST WOMEN BUT ALSO AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL. AS FOUR YEAR DEGREES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY PUSHED OVER THE YEARS. THE LAST DECADE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS AND ADULTS PURSUING CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION TRADES CAREERS HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY LEAVING A SUBSTANTIAL SKILL GAP IN AMERICA WE NEED THESE PEOPLE JOINING IN THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD TO BUILD OUR BRIDGES BUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILD HOMES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE GROWING DEMAND FOR THOSE WHO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION HAS PROVIDED GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGHER SALARIES CAREER GROWTH AND BENEFIT THAT THESE JOBS HAVE TO OFFER IT'S TIME FOR MORE WOMEN TO SEE THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES AS A VIABLE CAREER PATH AND NORMALIZE THE PARTICIPATION OF GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION ALSO AN APPRENTICESHIP CHIPS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND MR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS TODAY OF COURSE ARE VERY OWN BODIES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BENEFITTED FROM WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE. THERE ARE WOMEN ARE CAPITAL TODAY WHO ASSISTED US IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SWING SPACE AN ASTONISHING PROJECT DONE IN THIRTY TWO MONTHS DESPITE COVERT FOLKS TO TRANSFORM THAT PARKING LOT. INTO OUR PRESIDENCY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR IS REALLY A TESTAMENT TO THEIR SKILL. AND I WANT TO SPEAK ALSO TO. I REALIZE THERE'S TWO MOMENTS IN MY LIFE. MY PRESENCE IN THE ASSEMBLY. WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES ACTUALLY INTERVENE ONE SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SKILL THE PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE ACQUIRES INTERPRETER SHIP PROGRAMS THE OTHER ONE SPEAKS TO THE INDESCRIBABLE INGREDIENT OF COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE THE ABILITY ON A JOB YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THEN SEE A WAY TO EMBELLISH IT. AND THEY'RE BOTH TIED TO THIS BILL IS SO I MOVED HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BUY A HOUSE CITY GOT PREGNANT SHORTLY THEREAFTER IT DIDN'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING AND HODDLE SACRAMENTAL. AND I MOVE CITY HERE FOR THE MONTEREY PENINSULA THIS CLIMB WAS A SHOCK WE DECIDED TO ADD CENTRAL HEATING HERE TO MY HOME. I NEEDED UPGRADE THE PANEL. AND NOT A WOMAN BUT HER DAD WILLIAM SMITH WHO DIED MANY YEARS AGO MULTIPLE MYELOMA WAS AN ELECTRICIAN HE WAS ACTION THE PRESIDENT OF HIS UNION ON THE MONTEREY PENINSULA SACRAMENTO TO TAKE CARE HIS DAUGHTER AND PUT IN THAT UPGRADED PANEL TOOK CARE OF US WE GOT THE AC IN. BUILDING THE DUE COURSE OF TIME DIED DECADES LATER WE REPLACE THAT UNIT. EVERYTHING WAS SMOOTHLY WHAT WHAT WAS DONE. MY WIFE SEDUCER BROUGHT TO TEARS BECAUSE THE PERSON DOING THE WORK CAME AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. AND SAID TO HER ALL DONE. WHO DID YOUR PANEL. SHE OF COURSE SAID MY DAD DID THE PANEL. AND HE JUST REMARKED UPON THE CALL QUALITY OF WORK IN OUR LITTLE LEXICAL PANEL AT ONE OH SIX TWO FOUR CHARDONNAY DRIVE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING MAKES A DIFFERENCE IT'S SAFETY ON THE JOB BUT IT'S WELL BEING FOR THE PEOPLE RELY UPON IT. THE OTHER STORE I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS MORE ABOUT WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS BRING. DOWN ON THE FIRST FLOOR WE HAVE THE OLD MUSEUM ROOM TO NINETEEN OH SIX- TREASURE'S OFFICE. IT'S GOT AN ARCH WITH THE BEARS HAD IN IT WHEN THAT DOORS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. AND THAT ARCHES. INDICATIVE OF CAST IRON. BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL ST PAUL. THE ONE DOWN THERE IS ACTUALLY MADE OUT OF WOOD BECAUSE THAT WAS CHEAPER DURING THE RESTORATION. BUT THE CREWS WORKING ON OUR PROJECT INSTALLED THAT. PUT IT UP LOOKED OUT AND SAW THE WOOD GRAIN. REALIZED THIS IS ABOUT. A LEGACY THAT I'M CREATED FOR THE PEOPLE STAY THE CALIFORNIA THEY YANKED IT OFF THE WALL USE WHAT YOU AND I WOULD CALL SPACKLE COVER THE WHOLE THING UP. SANDED DOWN SEAL IT AND NOW LOOKS LIKE. CANSTAR WHICH JUST SAYS BEYOND THE SKILL THERE IS THIS INEFFABLE QUALITY THIS CREATIVITY THIS UNDERSTAND THE TASK AT HAND. AND HOW TO BRING IT HOME USING THEIR ART. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE CELEBRATE TODAY SKILL AND ART FULLNESS IN THE EXECUTION. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO WANT TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO. WHO IS ALWAYS SEEN THAT THE TRADES ARE A PATH TO SUCCESS FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS I'VE SEEN. HOW THESE THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS HAVE LED TO GREAT PAYING JOBS THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE'S FAMILIES- AND I I'M SO PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS DONE REALLY INVEST IN CTE PROGRAMS VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO THESE TRADES BUT AS I AS I'VE GONE AROUND TO SOME OF THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS- IN THE STATE I'VE JUST BEEN SO HARD TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF WOMEN. WHO ARE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE MANY OF THEM WE HAVE SOME OF THE GALLERY WITH US TODAY YOU SEEN IN THE BUILDING TODAY THEY'RE TRAPPED THEY'RE GOING AROUND- THESE WOMEN IN THE TRADES ARE DOING AMAZING THINGS AND THEY ARE WORTHY OF RECOGNITION I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. THE TRAIN PROGRAMS WHO HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO WOMEN AND GET MORE WOMEN INTO THE TRADES- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS MADE ON THAT FRONT BUT THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THAT WE STILL HAVE MORE WORK TO DO.
