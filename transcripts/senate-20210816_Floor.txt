WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH SENATOR ATKINS WHO HAS TWO PRESENTATIONS THIS MORNING SENATOR ACTIONS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. I RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF TWO GREAT HEROES FROM SAN DIEGO WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY. RETIRED MARINE COLONEL DAVE SEVERANCE AND RETIRED NAVY CHIEF PETTY OFFICER STUART NOBLE HEADLEY. COLONEL SEVERANCE A MAN OF GREAT VALOR AND DISTINCTION DIED AT THE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWO ON AUGUST SECOND. BORN IN MILWAUKEE HE GREW UP IN COLORADO AND JOINED THE MARINES IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. BRINGING HIM TO SAN DIEGO FOR BOOT CAMP. SEVEN YEARS LATER COLONEL SEVERANCE LEAD TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MEN AND SIX OFFICERS FROM CAMP PENDLETON. TO A SMALL ISLAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN. INTO THE BATTLE OF IWO JIMA. FOR MANY OF US AND I COMIC IN ICONIC IMAGE COMES TO MIND WHEN WE HEAR YOU WOULD TEAM UP. AN IMAGE OF SIX MARINES RAISING THE AMERICAN FLAG. THE FAMOUS PHOTO IS THE MODEL FOR THE U. S. MARINE CORPS WAR MEMORIAL IN ARLINGTON VIRGINIA. AND WAS FEATURED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX MOVIE FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS. IN FACT COLONEL SEVERANCE CONSULTANT ON THE FILM AND WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS. WHAT MANY DO NOT KNOW AND WHAT COLONEL SEVERIN SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO CLARIFY. IS THAT THE PHOTO ACTUALLY SHOWS THE SECOND AMERICAN FLAG RAISED ON MOUNT SURIBACHI THAT DAY. THE FIRST FLAG WAS RAISED EARLIER ON HIS ORDERS. FALL COLONEL SEVERANCE DID NOT KNOW THE BATTLE WOULD CONTINUE FOR THIRTY ONE MORE pDAYS AFTER THE FLAG WAS RAISED HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT SEEING IT WAVE OVER THE ISLAND WOULD BE A MORALE BOOST. AND IT WAS FOR THOSE ON THE FIELD AND THOSE BACK HOME. REFLECTING ON THE HISTORIC MOMENT YEARS LATER HE SAID THE FLAG WAS A SYMBOL OF THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE. THE MARINES SHOWED ON THAT BATTLEFIELD. TODAY BOTH FLAGS LAY IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE MARINE CORPS. ALONG WITH A NOTE AMENDING THE HISTORICAL RECORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TWO FLAGS. PLAYED A ROLE IN THE STORY. I KNOW THAT COLONEL SEVERANCE FOUGHT HARD TO SEE COME TO FRUITION. HE WAS AWARDED THE SILVER STAR AFTER THE BATTLE AND WE GO ON TO RECEIVE THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS. AS A COMBAT PILOT IN THE KOREAN WAR. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS TWO DAUGHTERS NINA AND LAND TWO SONS DAVE JUNIOR AND MIKE. SEVERAL GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. RETIRED NAVY CHIEF PETTY OFFICER STUART NOBLE HEADLEY FINALLY NOTICED TWO DIED FROM COMPLICATIONS OF CODE NINETEEN ON AUGUST FOURTH. JUST EIGHTY SIX DAYS SHY OF HIS HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY. BORN IN FLORIDA RAISED IN BUFFALO NEW YORK. HEADLEY WAS INSPIRED TO SERVE FROM A YOUNG AGE AT JUST FOUR FEET ELEVEN INCHES HE WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE NAVY WHEN HE FIRST TRIED TO JOIN. AFTER BUILDING SOME MUSCLE AND MENTAL FORTITUDE SERVING IN THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS. AND GROWING A FEW INCHES HE TRIED AGAIN AND WAS FINALLY ABLE TO TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE IN NINETEEN FORTY. ON DECEMBER SEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY ONE CHIEF HEADLEY WAS SITTING. IN THE USS WEST VIRGINIA AT PEARL HARBOR WHEN A JAPANESE SHOW BLEW THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. JUST BARELY MISSING HIM HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE BY JUMPING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING THROUGH OIL AND FLAMES WHILE THE ATTACK RAGED ON. AFTER SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE NAVY FOR TWENTY YEARS HE RETIRED AND SPENT ANOTHER TWO DECADES SERVING OUR COMMUNITY. WITH THE LEMAY SAID SPRING VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT. THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE CHIEF HADLEY WAS FUELED BY A DUTY TO SEE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THREE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THAT FATEFUL DECEMBER DAY. DID NOT DO SO INVADING. A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO CHAPTER OF THE PEARL HARBOR SURVIVORS ASSOCIATION. HE REGULARLY SPOKE AT SCHOOLS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS EVENTS TELLING THE STORY OF THAT DAY AND THE LESSONS HE LEARNED FROM THE WAR. HE EMBODIED THE CHAPTERS MOTTO REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR KEEP AMERICA ALERT. SURVIVED BY HIS DAUGHTERS BARBARA PATTY AND NANCY AND HIS SON RIGHT. I THAT IS CERTAINLY- IN SAN DIEGO STEW IS ONE OF THE VERY FINAL MEMBERS OF THE PEARL HARBOR SURVIVORS. COLONEL SEVERANCE AND CHIEF HADLEY WERE HEROES PATRIOTS AND KEEPERS OF OUR HISTORY AS THE NUMBER OF WORLD WAR TWO SURVIVORS DWINDLES THEIR DEATH SYMBOLIZED THE END OF AN ERA THAT WE MUST NOT FORGET. COLLEAGUES TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN RECOGNITION OF THE LOGS AND THE SERVICE THESE TWO MILITARY VETERANS OF THE GREATEST GENERATION GAVE TO OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU SIR RECKONS I JOIN UNION GERMAN MEMORY FOR TWO AMERICAN. AND SAN DIEGO HE ROSE FROM THE MERIT HIS GREATEST GENERATION THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT DIED CHARM IN THE MEMORY OF A- LONG STANDING I THINK THE LONGEST STANDING MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN HIS PARTY WHICH IS NOT MY PARTY. BUT HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND A WONDERFUL PUBLIC SERVANT. I MET HIM FIRST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS WHEN HE SERVED IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE BEFORE HE WENT TO CONGRESS IN THE SEVENTIES. I DIDN'T KNOW THE GUY FROM ADAM AND HE- WAS ONE OF THESE FOLKS THAT IMPRESSED ME BECAUSE THEY LOOKED IN THE EYE AND HE LISTENED AND ASKED QUESTIONS. AND HE STUCK AROUND IN JUST ONE OFF TO THE OTHER EVENT. THAT MAN WAS CHARLES JERMAINE LEWIS BETTER KNOWN. AS JERRY LEWIS THE POLITICIAN JERRY LEWIS. HE WAS SO SOMEONE WHERE ALTHOUGH HE WAS CONSERVATIVE IN HIS VIEWS OF PANAMA'S POLITICAL TRADITION OF CIVILITY COOPERATION CONGENIALITY HE WAS AN ARCHETYPE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATOR. WHILE HIS SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH STOP POLITICS AS WAR BY ANOTHER MEANS JERRY LEWIS THOUGHT POLITICS AS A WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND HE DID EXACTLY THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY HE SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST AIR QUALITY COMMITTEE WHICH LED TO THE FORMATION OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN CONGRESS HE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO UNCOVER FRAUD AND ABUSE IN HOUSING. HE STEERED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARD VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. WORKED ON STEM CELL AND WORK HARD AT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY FOR THE PROTON BEAM TREATMENT CENTER. A REAL STEP FORWARD IN TECHNOLOGY. A LIFELONG SWIMMER CONGRESSMAN LEWIS WAS KNOWN TO SWIM FOR A HUNDRED LAPS TODAY IN THE HOUSE WING POOL AND IMPRESSIVELY SAVING THEN HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT. FROM DROWNING IN HAWAII IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. HE WAS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON WHO DESERVES OUR RESPECT HE PASSED AWAY. ON JULY FIFTEENTH OF AFTER A LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICES I SUGGEST. I CLOSE WITH THE WORDS OF MITCH ALL BORN WHO ONCE WROTE. WE MOVED TO PLACES EVERY DAY THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IF NOT FOR THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US. OUR WORK PLACE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME WE OFTEN THINK THEY BEGAN WITH OUR OWN ARRIVAL. THAT IS NOT TRUE. MEMBERS LET'S BEAR IN MIND AS WE REFLECT ON THE LIE AND LEGACY. OF A BRILLIANT LEGISLATOR JERRY LEWIS ACID WE CHURN. IN HIS MEMORY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. SENATOR HER TADO. TODAY I ASKED THE SENATE ADJOURNED IN THE MEMORY OF DEPUTY PHILIP COMP US WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY ON JULY TWENTY FIFTH DEPUTY COMPASS WAS KNOWN TO MANY FOR HIS BIG HEART TENACITY AND HIS DEDICATION TO HIS COMMUNITY. HE RECEIVED A CALL ON JULY TWENTY FIFTH BUT THERE WERE REPORTS OF GUNSHOTS AT A HOME IN THE CITY OF WASCO. A SUSPECT HAD BARRICADED. HIMSELF IN THE HOME WHAT PROMPTED THE SWAT TEAM TO BE ACTIVATED AS A MEMBER OF THE SWAT TEAM DEPUTY CAMPUS RESPONDED IT WAS SHOT. HE LATER DIED OF HIS INJURIES DEPUTY COMPASS IS A HERO. OR BECOMING A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY HE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS WHERE HE WAS DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN. WELL AT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HE NOT ONLY TWENTY RECRUITS BUT HE ALSO SERVED IN KERN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE HONOR GUARD. HIS LIFE OF SERVICE IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE ADMIRED AND HONORED. HE WAS A DEFINITION OF SELFLESS AND HE RAN TOWARDS DANGER WHEN OTHERS SOUGHT REFUGE. HIS COWORKERS AND FRIENDS SAY HE WAS A WARRIOR AND A NATURAL BORN LEADER SOMEONE WHO CHALLENGE THOSE AROUND HIM AND WHO. WANTED YOU IN HIS CORNER. HE HAS A HUSBAND WHO LEAVES BEHIND HIS WIFE CHRISTINA AND A FATHER WHO LEAVES BEHIND HIS THREE CHILDREN. I ASKED THE DEPUTY COMPASS AND HIS SERVICE BE MEMORIALIZED HERE TODAY AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. WE USE A STANDARD ROAD ON THE SIDE OF. TO RAISE AN ACID TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF A PHILIP COMPASS HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUAL IS MY COLLEAGUE AT THIS YEAR'S KERN COUNTY SAYS I'M HE'S ACTUALLY MY CONSISTED CONSTITUENT. BUT THE INCIDENT THAT TOOK HIS LIFE WAS IN MOSCOW WHEN MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT BESIDES THE UNITED STATES MILITARY MARINE CORPS VETERAN HE HAD AN INFECTIOUS SMILE HE PARTICIPATED WHEN HE GOT INVOLVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE TRAINING ACADEMY. AND HE HAD AN IMPACT ON ALMOST EVERY OFFICER THAT WENT TO THE TRAINING ACADEMY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE INDIVIDUAL AND WAS ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL HE LOVED TO RIDE HORSES HE WOULD BRANDON GATHER IN RIDE HORSES OUT IN- MY COMMUNITY. OUT WHERE I LIVE AND- OUR NEIGHBOR'S CAT ACCOUNT WAY POLLING AND IS WHAT WE CALL AN IN CAB WE JAMMED THEY WOULD TAKE HIM OUT AND TEACH HIM HOW TO BE A REAL COWBOY. M. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS LOST IN THIS TRANSLATION- THAT WE DIDN'T COVER- AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS VERY MUCH IS THAT HE HE DIED A HERO WHICH HE SAID BUT HE DIED A HERO SAVING A FAMILY. ARE TRYING TO SAVE A FAMILY THIS WAS A HORRIFIC INCIDENT THAT RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITY WE HAD A FATHER AT GUNPOINT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION KILLHIS WIFE. AND HIS TWO SONS AND TRY TO KILL HIS TWO DAUGHTERS IF IT WASN'T FOR OFFICER CAMPOS SWAT TEAM MEMBER CAMPUS- I'M YOU KNOW TRYING TO RUSH THE FRONT DOOR THOSE TWO LITTLE GIRLS WOULD'VE PROBABLY LOST THEIR LIFE AS WELL. A THEY REMAIN IS FAMILY THE WIFE. OF THE PERPETRATOR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT COMMITTED THIS HORRIFIC CRIME. AT LOST THESE TWO LITTLE GIRLS LOST THEIR MOM. AND THEIR TWO BROTHERS IN THIS PROCESS. THIS HORRIFIC ACT RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITY. M. TORE APART- THE HEARTS OF THE SWAT TEAM THAT SERVED SO VALIANTLY. AND NEXT TO SIT M. OFFICER PHILLIP CAMPUS. FOR A LONG TIME SEVERAL YEARS. AND HE EXCELLED AT EVERYTHING BUT HIS MAIN OBJECTIVE THAT WEIGHT DOWN THAT DAY WAS TO TRY TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE. IN A HORRIFIC SITUATION. AND IT WAS HIS HEROISM THAT SAVE THOSE TWO LITTLE GIRLS LIFE. SO I ASK YOU TO ENTER IN THE MEMORY OF PHILIP CAMPUS. THERE AMERISAFE ANALLY IN PLEASE COVER THIS ENTIRE SITUATION IN PRAYER AS YOU THINK ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THESE TWO LITTLE GIRLS ARE- THAT WERE LEFT BY THE FATHER WHO PERPETRATED THE ACT. AND THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE FOREVER DESTROYED.
