IT WITH THIS SMALL LITTLE FILL IN AND LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE MEAN I DON'T KNOW. ABOUT THE CAUGHT ROUTE BECAUSE EVERY PLANET WHICH TALKED ABOUT THE PRICE OF RECYCLABLES I DON'T KNOW THE BUSINESS MODELS THEY GREW TOO BIG WHAT WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS BUT BUT I WOULD HATE TO SEE US THINK THAT. OKAY HERE'S A BANDAID. ON THIS ON THIS PROBLEM AND THEN NOT DO THE HARD WORK. IN THE FALL AND NEXT YEAR TO REALLY DIG IN AND MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE THAT THIS THE STATUS QUO SO I KNOW IT'S IN THE SESSION. AND I KNOW THAT THESE THINGS COME UP AND I'M SURE. THE PILOT PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO IS DELIGHTED THAT WE HAVE A CHAMPION HERE BUT BUT- WE REALLY NEED TO. TO SPEND SOME TIME AND LOOK AT THIS THE DYSFUNCTION OF THE OF THE OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ACCESS WITH. I KNOW WE HAVE THE WAY TO THE AUTHOR BUT I OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I MEAN AS YOU KNOW THIS OBVIOUSLY. IS JUST PUSHES ONE EXEMPTION THIRTY JULY FIRST. I ANOTHER ONE TO THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS OF REALLY IS A BANDAID I KNOW THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS THAT IT IS REALLY YOU COMMIT WORKING WITH YOU STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE INTERNET OF COURSE.

AB FIFTY FOUR IS A RESPONSE TO WHAT HAS BEEN A RECYCLING CRISIS IN OUR STATE OBVIOUSLY WE HAD RE PLANET CLOSE OVER TWO HUNDRED LOCATIONS. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED WITH THE SENATE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP. POTENTIALLY BE A SHORT TERM FIX BUT WE OBVIOUSLY NEED A LONGER TERM FIX THOSE THREE THINGS WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RECYCLING CENTERS. FIVE MILLION FOR MOBILE RECYCLING WHICH WE THINK WE WANT TO KIND OF FURTHER TRY OUT AS A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE RECYCLING AS WELL AS I'M GETTING RELIEF CALL THE CONVENIENCE AND GROCERY STORES AND KIND WIDENING THAT CONVENIENCE OUT. SO ON WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD SHORT TERM FIX TO HELP GET US INTO NEXT YEAR WITH THE HOPE THAT NEXT YEAR. WE'LL BE BACK WITH SOMETHING BIGGER SO WITH THAT HAPPY DICK QUESTIONS.

CASKEY REGARDING. THE NEED AN IMPERATIVE TO ENACT A LARGER REFORM THE PROGRAM NEXT YEAR THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR STEP THANK YOU. GERMAN MEMBERS MIKE MAD ACCOUNTS OVER CONSUMER WATCHDOG AND I COULDN'T SAY IT ANY BETTER THAN SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GOOD WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ALL OVER THE YEAR. WE HAD A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SOLUTION. FOR A MID CENTURY PROBLEM AND WE APPRECIATE THE URGENTLY NEEDED EMERGENCY FUNDS AND THAT THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU ALL. YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD WITHOUT AUSTIN GILBERT ROADS AND SPENT ON BEHALF OF RITE AID ALSO. AND SUSAN COLLINS WITH A IN A RECYCLING INSTITUTE NEITHER IN SUPPORT AND NOR IN OPPOSITION. BUT I DO WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IT WAS PROPOSED ABOUT. AT BOTH SHARING THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM AND EXPLAINING THAT NO THE RE PLANET CLOSURE. AND THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY WASN'T. I'M UNUSUAL OR UNPREDICTABLE. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE DID PREDICT THESE CLOSURES YEARS AGO AND WROTE PAPERS IN FACT SHEETS AND DOCUMENTED THAT THESE WERE GOING TO HAPPEN I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A CALCULATOR. THE THIS PROGRAM HAS HAD FUNDAMENTAL SHORTFALLS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH PAYMENT FORMULA FOR REDEMPTION CENTERS. THAT FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM STILL EXISTS MORE REDEMPTION CENTERS WILL CLOSE HOUSING A CUTE SITUATIONS LIKE WHAT EXISTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WERE ONLY SIXTY FOUR REDEMPTION CENTERS EXIST FOR EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. SO SMALL ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS WON'T BEGIN TO CLOSE THIS WHOLE REDEMPTION CENTERS HAVE BEEN UNDERPAID SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND JUST THE INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE COST THEM ANOTHER EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR THAT I'M COVERED BY THE PAYMENT FORMULA SO I HAVE SOME FACT SHEETS THAT CAN PROVIDE TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEY EXPLAINED THE SITUATION BUT WE DEFINITELY DO NEED FUNDAMENTAL COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THIS PROGRAM OR WILL JUST CONTINUE TO TURN THIS INTO A TAX WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T GET THERE. TENSION VALUE PACK THANK YOU. YEP OKAY OF FOLKS HONOREE OKAY MARK MARIE OF MR REMEMBERS MARK RUTH CALIFORNIA YES WASTE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT LAST NIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER MARKETS REALLY WORK TO. OUR OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS THOUGHTS THROUGH CASKEY MADE A VERY AB. SOLID COMMENT BEFORE YOU GOT HERE SOME REMEMBER THAT I I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE WITH BUT OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THIS IS THE MOVE BY I CENTER DOLLY. ASSEMBLY CASKEY AND WE HAVE AN EXPLANATION OF THE AMENDMENT LAST NIGHT THAT I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT IS REMOVED MR MURRAY. CONSULTING SO IT WAS DONE THE BILL ORIGINALLY WAS ONLY FIVE MILLION FROM MOBILE RECYCLING AND THE GROCERY. CONVENIENCE STORE RELIEF WE ADDED FIVE MILLION FOUR RECYCLING CENTERS. WITH SOME PALM ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS AND MY READ. MY READING IS THAT CAL RECYCLE CAN EXPAND UP TO FIVE MILLION IN EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS. MY RE I'M READING FROM. FROM NINETEEN. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CAL RECYCLE AT TO E TO. FIVE MILLION THAT'S TOTAL SWITCH YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT SO IT'S TOOL IT'S FIVE MILLION FOR THAT. THE REGULAR CENTERS AND FIVE MILLION FOR THE MOBILE CENTER YES THAT'S RIGHT. IN IN THAT ALSO THIS THE THEN THEY OUGHT THEN THEY CAN EXPAND UP TO FIVE MILLION FROM THE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER. PROGRAM TO THAT WITH FIFTEEN MILLION. ALL IN. YEAH WELL MY STATUS QUO FINEST THERE IS ALREADY IS FIVE MILLION BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TEN. SO YEAH WE'RE READY WE'RE JUST FIVE MILLION IN THIS RESPECT. I REALIZE PART OF THE FIX HERE IS THAT THE GROCERY STORES THAT ARE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE A CENTER THAT HAD BEEN. CLOSE THEY GET OF WAIVER OR OF WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE A TIME HERE WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BOUNTY IN TILL THERE'S AN APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED IS BEING PROCESS. I SEE. IT'S REALLY FOR THE FOR THE GROCERS HOW DOES THAT HELP OUT THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD RECEIVE. ASSEMBLY THEY WOULD RECEIVE THAT MONEY AND GIVE IT OUT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. RECYCLING TO BRING OTHER THINGS IN THE PROGRAM LEAVE COMES AND THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO. AGAIN WE KNOW IT'S A SHORT TERM FIX JUST A TIES OVER INTO NEXT YEAR. WITH AND WE PURPOSELY DID NOT WANT TO DO. A LOT MORE MONEY OR- HAVE. A LONGER TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A MORE STRUCTURAL. REFORM A MORE STRUCTURAL. PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WAITING IN THE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT IN THE BUDGET FOR THE LAST THREE FOUR YEARS AND REALLY HAVE NOT MADE VERY MUCH PROGRESS. SO WE KNOW THAT. GIVEN THE SITUATION THE TIME IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT TO DO THE STRUCTURAL REFORM THAT MANY PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT. I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT LACK OF PROGRESS YES LET'S BRING THE OIL LONGER. THAN FOUR YEARS FOR ME TO ASK BY THE ONLY INVOLVED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. OKAY QUESTION FIVE REMOVED BY SENATE DOLLY. YEAH SENATE ON. I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE ON THE COMMITTEE TO. WORK ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW WE HAD YEAH. WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR ON ON MANY OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES I WORKED WITH THE THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GORDON WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON RECYCLING ISSUES WITH THESE ARE NOT JUST GENERIC TO. SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTY I LIVE IN LAST YEAR WITH REDEMPTION CENTERS AND- IT'S A PROBLEM SO THE BEER THE CALORIE CYCLE I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE- RUNNING THE PROG. THERE'S DOOM'S MEANS COST SAVING MEASURES THERE THAT WILL HELP. THAT'S RIGHT AND I ALSO THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATUTORY CHALLENGES THAT I KNOW CENTER GLAZERS TRYING TO DRESS IN A TO SOME EXTENT YOUR ADDRESS HERE. THEIR HANDS ARE TIED ALL SORTS OF WEIRD WAYS AS WE'VE BEEN DIGGING CARVE ITSELF DEEPER INTO THIS POLICY AREA. AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT. GIVE US MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THEIR WORK. ON ANY OUT. OKAY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT ON THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. TOTAL MANDATE A HAVING A PHONE RECOGNIZES THE MANDATE IT'S IN PERFECT I JUST IT'S FRUSTRATING HOW UNABLE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE AS A LEGISLATURE AND AS A GOVERNMENT TO. MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS AND- WE ALL HAVE TO TOGETHER DOUBLE DOWN ON TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS IN THE COMING YEAR. SO I WITH THAT THE MOST HAS BEEN MADE THAT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
