RELATED TO PRIVACY PROTECTION PRACTICES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORNING GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MADAM UNDER A FREER HELP TODAY I'M HERE IS A TO REQUEST THAT OUR JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVE AN AUDIT OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DDD. TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE DD DOES AND DOES NOT AND SHOULD DO BETTER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AYE IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EDT AND WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE JUST CUSTOMERS. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN JUST TO PROVIDE SOME SOME CONTEXT IN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND NEWS REPORTS INDICATED THAT EDT WAS MAILING DOCUMENTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS. AND THOSE DOCUMENTS IN PAPER MAIL. SNAIL MAIL CONTAINS THEIR FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WITH THEIR HOME ADDRESS WITH THEIR NAME AND OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION. REPORTS STATED THAT PEOPLE OTHER THAN PEOPLE'S ET DE DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL RECEIVED OTHER PEOPLE'S EDT DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL SO SOMETIMES THERE IT YOU ACCIDENTALLY GET SOMEBODY ELSE'S MAILING. WITH THEIR SO SECURITY NUMBER THEIR NAME THEIR ADDRESS AND PRIVATE INFORMATION ADDITIONAL REPORTS STATED IT SO SECURITY NUMBER WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE THROUGH THE PLASTIC ENVELOPE -- SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO RECEIVE THE PIECE OF MAIL IF YOU SOMEHOW GOT A HOLD OF IT -- YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THAT INFORMATION AND I I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY UP I'M SURE IS ALARMING TDD. I WAS ALARMING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BECAUSE SO SECURITY NUMBERS ARE ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST VALUABLE PIECES OF CURRENCY. WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO COMMIT FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT I WHICH IS RAMPANT ENOUGH AS IT IS? AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SNAIL MAIL IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS MOST VULNERABLE TO FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT FOR CONSTITUENTS IN LIGHT OF THIS NEWS BACK. OF OVER THREE YEARS AGO. A MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE IN THIS BODY INCLUDING MYSELF. I SENT A LETTER TO EDT IN JULY OF TWENTY FIFTEEN BY DEMANDING AND REQUESTING ITS POLITELY AS WE COULD TO STOP PRINTING FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR CUSTOMERS. IN FACT THE CHAIR OF THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER OF MIKE DATO ALSO SEND A SEPARATE LETTER MAKING SIMILAR DEMANDS REQUESTS. AND IN ADDITION I PERSONALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH -- THE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT OF A FOR OF EDT LATER THAT MONTH TO JUST HAVE A ONE ON ONE CONVERSATION AS YOU'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE IT'S OFTEN SOMETHING I SAID IF WE CAN. REACH OUT TO AGENCIES AND TRY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT LEGISLATION AUDIT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY TRY TO DO SO. THE RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM EDTA WHICH YOU I BELIEVE HAVING YOUR BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM OCTOBER. TWENTY FIFTEEN STATED THAT THEY WOULD WORK TO BEGIN TO REMOVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND THAT ALSO SECURITY NUMBERS WOULD BE REMOVED FROM ALL FORMS BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY FIFTEEN THE RESPONSE ALSO STATED THAT EDTA IS PLANNING TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF MAILED FORMS AND TO REVAMPING UPDATE ITS LEGACY COMPUTER SYSTEMS RIGHTLY SO. AND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS COULD OPT INTO ONLINE SERVICES THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE RELIANCE ON PAPER DOCUMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR WITH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. NEWS REPORTS LATER CONFIRMED HOWEVER THAT EDT CUSTOMERS WERE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE. SNAIL MAIL WHEN THEY HAD REQUESTED NOT TO AND YEARS LATER THAT THE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WAS STILL IN THERE. THIS INCLUDED CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS WHO WERE ON MATERNITY LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN RECEIVING THEIR DISABILITY CHECK THEY HAVE GONE ONLINE TO OPT FOR ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS WITH EDT. AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AND SNAIL MAIL OTHER FOR THEIR FULL SO SECURITY NUMBER AND OTHER PAPERS -- SO AGAIN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I REACHED OUT -- TO THE DIRECTOR I WAS VERY GRATEFUL FOR HIS ACCESSIBILITY AND HIS CANDID CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CHALLENGES EDT WAS FACING. AND FOUND -- I FOUND IT TO BE ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS WHERE WE BOTH PROBABLY FELT THAT BE HAD BANGED OUR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL IN FRUSTRATION. WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING -- BUT THE ANSWER I RECEIVED AND THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE IS THIS IS AS GOOD AS WE CAN DO -- THAT WE WERE WRONG AND WHAT WE SAID BEFORE WASN'T QUITE RIGHT AND NOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE MANY YEARS TO EVEN BEGIN TO MAKE THE KIND OF CHANGES NECESSARY TO DO SOMETHING THAT. WE ARE HOLDING BUSINESSES ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING IF IF THEY DO IT POORLY AND THAT IS PROTECT THE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M SO I I WANNA SAY I'M VERY THANKFUL TO THE DIRECTOR FOR FOR YEARS NOW I'D KNOWING THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. BUT HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM EDTA IN RESPONSE INCONSISTENT ANSWERS -- RELIANCE AT ONE POINT IN SAYING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRED US SO SECURITY NUMBERS TO BE USED WE LATER FOUND THAT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN LAW SAYS THAT AGENCIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS IN THE MAIL TO CONSTITUENTS UNLESS IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW AND IT IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW -- MEMBERS I HAVE SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THREE AND HALF YEARS NOW I RARELY REQUESTED ON IT. AND YOU OFTEN HEAR A BROKEN RECORD FOR ME WHICH IS CAN WE WAIT AND SEE IF WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN FIRST BEFORE WE TRY TO LAUNCH THE AUDITOR INTO A DEPARTMENT -- AB DONE THAT I MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE DONE THAT AND NOW I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE VERY. IT IS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE AN END IF I DE AND EXAMINE WHAT CAN BE DONE BETTER. HOW IS THIS AFFECTING OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT IS WE AS A LEGISLATURE NEED TO DO WHAT IS IT YOU DO YOU NEED TO DO -- IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU MS BAKER IDEA -- WANT TO BEFORE WE CALL UPON THE AUDITOR FOR HER PRESENTATION. I JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER THE STANDARD FORMAT FOR ALL PRESENTATIONS TODAY FOR THE SAKE OF THE AUDIENCE. AND THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING THIS ON TV -- ARE STANDARD FORMAT WILL BE THAT -- THE REQUEST HER OF THE AUDIT WILL FOR ME FIRST MAKE THEIR PRESENTATION. THEN EACH MEMBER WOULD HAVE UP TO TWO WITNESSES TO MAKE -- STATEMENTS ARE UP TO WE ASK ALL WITNESSES TO TRY TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES EACH -- YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ELABORATE ON YOUR PRESENTATION NOW THROUGH THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT WE FOLLOWED UP -- IT PRESENTATION FROM THE MEMBER WILL OR THE REQUEST WILL BE FOLLOWED UP BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION OF HER ANALYSIS -- I WILL THEN INVITE THE AFFECTED AGENCY. TWO RESPONDED TO MAKE COMMENTS REGARDING THE AUDIT REQUESTS -- AGAIN IT ASKING GOD THE RESPONDING AGENCIES TO TRY TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS AT TWO MINUTES -- WITH FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ELABORATE -- FROM QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN THE PUBLIC WILL BE INVITED TO COMMENT ON THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO EACH I REQUEST. AFTER THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. SO WELL WITH THAT -- NAME. WELL ACTUALLY LET SEC -- COMMENTS. YES -- STATE AUDITOR PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AS MS BAKER INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF EDTA IN AND WE WOULD START OUT BY LOOKING AT WHAT THEIR POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE. FOR PROTECTING TOM P. I I ESSENTIALLY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND DO THOSE PRACTICES COMPLY WITH STATE AND AT STATE LAWS FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE ANY STATE POLICIES. AND THEN SPECIFIC TO THE THE ITEM SHE IDENTIFIED SENSE TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE IS EDT CONTINUING TO MAIL DOCUMENTS. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ESSENTIALLY OR CONSUMERS CUSTOMERS OF OF EDT -- THAT CONTAIN PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BUT WE WILL ALSO LOOK FOR OTHER INFORMATION -- AND IF THEY ARE DOING THAT WHY ARE THEY CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND HAVE THEY CONSIDERED ANY ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMMUNICATING WITH CONSTITUENTS ET HAVE THEY COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR ENSURING THAT THEY PROTECT THAT INFORMATION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING AND AND MS BAKER INDICATED THIS IN HER LETTER THERE ARE -- CONSUMERS ARE OUR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE ASKED TO BE ABLE TO JUST COMMUNICATE AND WITH THE DD ONLINE AND NOT RECEIVE HARD COPY DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL SO TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE SHE'S ASKING US IDENTIFY HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS. HAVE ASKED TO JUST WORK WITH THE DD ONLINE AND OF THOSE HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL THAT AGAIN CONTAIN PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. OUT WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVES WATER DVDS PLANTS CLEARLY THERE THEY HAVE A LEGACY SYSTEM WE ALL KNOW THAT DO THEY HAVE PLANS TO REPLACE THAT SYSTEM. HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE HOW COSTLY IS THAT GOING TO BE SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT? OF MS BAKER ASKED US TO LOOK AT ALSO COMPLAINTS ALL THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT DVD HAS RECEIVED OVER CERTAIN TIME FRAME AND WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN BANNED TO THOSE COMPLAINTS HAVE HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN TIMELY. HAVE THOSE RESPONSES BEEN EFFECTIVE AND THEN FINALLY REALLY LOOKING AT ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS THAT. PERHAPS WE CAN IDENTIFY OR THAT EDT HAS LOOKED AT AND THE RATIONALE FOR NOT PERHAPS -- PURSUING SOME OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES TO TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF A PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION GETTING IN THE WRONG HANDS THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT IS ABOUT. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED HOURS THAT WOULD TAKE ARM AUDIT STAFF ABOUT FIVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MS BAKER DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF YOUR REQUEST AT THIS TIME NOW JUST BEGAN BEHALF OF A LOT OF PEOPLE YES ARUM. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME -- PATRICK HEADING THE DIRECTOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- WELCOME SIR WHICH LIKE. TO THANK YOU -- IT AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MONIES PATRICK HAVING THEM DIRECTOR THE BY THE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M I'M CLEAR AND I THINK HAVE EXPRESSED ITS THIS TO SOMEONE BAKER AND PUTTING INNER. A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT I DO SHARE THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT PROTECTING. FOLKS INIVIDUAL -- PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PI -- IDENTITY THEFT IS COSTLY IT'S TIME CONSUMING -- AND IT ENDS UP BEING A TERRIBLE WASTE OF EXCUSE ME TERRIBLE INVASION OF PEOPLE'S -- DURING MY TENURE AT EDT A SINCE HAVE BEEN APPOINTED I THINK WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS ON CELS COULD IN NUMBERS AND FRANKLY -- WE CONTINUE TO DO SO -- AND REMOVING THOSE FROM OUR SYSTEMS THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM SEN COUNTRY -- GREW UP USING SO SECURITY NUMBER SIT SPEND -- NUMBER THAT THE STATE HAS USED ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE. SUCCESSFULLY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- AND WE HAVE REMOVED SO SECURITY NUMBERS ON ABOUT 3240% OF ALL DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE AT THE DEPARTMENT. OF SINCE OF MISS BAKER OF BROUGHT HURTS CONCERNS TO US -- AND FRANKLY EVEN BEFORE THAT A DATING BACK -- TO PRIOR DIRECTORS EMPIRE MOVES AS OF IF SOMEONE BAKER ALLUDED TO SOME LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN THE STATE. OF PRIOR TO THIS -- THOUGH BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY OF BACKING UP I BELIEVE IT WAS -- TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE -- KNOWING THIS -- ISSUE -- AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK AN EXTRAORDINARY ACTION -- AND IT HAS TO DO WITH SORT OF A LARGER CATASTROPHE THAT THE US STATE AUDITOR BROUGHT UP. A WHICH WAS THAT OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMPUTER SYSTEM FELT -- AS SOON AS I WAS APPOINTED ASSUME IS -- THESE ISSUES CAME UP -- FOURTH THE PATHWAY TO REPLACE THAT COMPUTER SYSTEM. THE LEGACY COMPUTER SYSTEM IT HAS OVER NINE THOUSAND A DIFFERENT COBALT PROGRAMS THAT IT INTERSECTS WITH. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE. OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- IN FRANKLY WILL BE -- EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND UPDATE WELL WELL INTO THE FUTURE. THAT IS WHY BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PUT IN ITS BUDGET. SET ASIDE TO REPLACE A COMPUTER SYSTEM IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM IN WITHIN THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THIS LEGISLATURE IN IN THEIR VOTES -- AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE -- PROVIDED -- WE'VE STATED THAT WE HAVE FULL INTENT OF REPLACING THAT WITHIN -- BUT THAT SYSTEM FAT THERE'S BEEN. APPROXIMATELY I THINK IT WAS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF SET ASIDE -- FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS SOME MONEY REDIRECTED FROM MY DEPARTMENT FOR THE SEPARATE SOME OF THAT MONEY WE USED -- TO TRUNCATE REMOVE A SOURCE COULD BE NUMBERS OR WE CAN -- BACK THEN. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- THIS ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE THAT THIS ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL FRANKLY NEVER BE ABLE TO GET RID OF SO SECURITY NUMBERS. AND ITS USE IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. AND IT'S NOT A STATE. ISSUE. IT'S THE WAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES US AWAY TO BUT MOVE ABOUT MONEY WE TALK ABOUT BEST PRACTICES FRANKLY THE STAGE GATE SYSTEM THAT IS SET FORTH WITHIN CDT -- SUCH ASIDE TIMES WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT BEST PRACTICES. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE WILL GET -- TO AND HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THEM AND GOING THROUGH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS BEST PRACTICES ARE. I'D LOVE PRESS TO GET TO ONLINE ONLY THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SET ASIDE MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO GET TO THAT PLACE ALRIGHT MR HENNING GONNA ASK YOU TO WRAP UP. I I I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY -- THAT AS MUCH AS I WOULD APPRECIATE A KNOWING IF THERE'S ANY MORE THINGS WE CAN DO AT A DEPARTMENT -- THAT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO MEET WITH A SOMEONE BAKER ANYBODY THAT HAS CONCERNS ON THIS ISSUE. UP BUT THAT WILL ALSO BECAUSE THIS IS A BUDGET ITEM THAT'S BEEN IN THE BUDGET FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ANNUALLY ON THIS TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE PROCESS IS THAT WE HAVE. A SUPPORT TO DO THIS OF THAT I THINK WILL ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER -- SEEKS TO CORRECT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MR HENNING -- I THE BUT BEFORE OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS -- I WANT -- TO REMIND. NOT ONLY YOU MISTER HEADACHE BUT TO ALL OF OUR AFFECTED AGENCIES AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE THAT WENT -- TO THE STATE AUDITOR SHARED WITH ME IN OUR MEETING YESTERDAY WHICH IS THAT NOT ONLY -- DOES OUR STATE AUDITOR PROVIDE THE VALUE OF OF CONDUCTING THEIR INDEPENDENT AUDITS OF OF THESE AGENCIES BUT ALSO. TO SERVE AS A A A CONSULTANT -- IN TERMS OF WAYS -- TO IMPROVE OR TO TRIED TRIED. TO ACHIEVE THE THEM THE MISSION AND THE GOALS THAT -- THAT -- WE ARE SETTING FORTH -- NINE PERHAPS A PROVIDE NEW IDEAS AND NEW SUGGESTIONS ARE PERHAPS A FOUNDATION. FOR FUTURE BUDGET REQUESTS FOR UPDATES TO ET DE A COMPUTER SYSTEMS -- ITSELF MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS THAT. BECAUSE AS I SAID AND I I BELIEVE AUDIT WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME [inaudible] ARE. SISTER COMPUTER SYSTEM IS IN SUCH A STATE. OF WITH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THAT. THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE. MAY DISTRACT FROM THE MISSION OF COMPLETING THAT COMPUTER SYSTEM. AND THAT WOULD PUT IT IT'S JUST IT'S A MITIGATION OF RISK. IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SIR AND I'M AND I WOULD. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BOUNCING HERE. AND I AND I HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE SEES THAT. AND HOPEFULLY CITIES THAT OKAY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN WHAT WE WHAT WE WILL ASK THE AUDITOR TO IF IF THIS REQUEST IS APPROVED -- SEE THAT OR NOT AND AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE MS RUBIO. BOB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- US ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAKER INDICATED THAT -- ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE TO HER WAS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRED TO SUCH SECURITIES TO BE -- PUT ON THE DOCUMENTS AND SHE INDICATED THAT THAT WAS NOT CORRECT AND RIGHT NOW HE DIDN'T MADE A STATEMENT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I JUST HEARD AT THE PUBLIC IN NEW ONCE BUT IT TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS IS THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WE THE WAY THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IS SET UP. IS THAT -- AS ALL THIS IS WORKING CALIFORNIANS -- WE IDENTIFY YOURSELF WHEN WE GO TO OUR EMPLOYERS LOT OF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS FOLKS -- POTENTIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WITH IDENTIFY WAGES TO THAT THOSE WAGES ARE IN TURN USE SO THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU QUALIFY. FOR A VARIETY OF BENEFITS INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN ITS DOCUMENTS REQUIRES AN IDENTIFIER. THE ONLY IDENTIFIER UP UNTIL. FRANKLY RECENTLY -- HAS BEEN USEFUL SECURITY NUMBER. SO WHILE THEY DO NOT USE THE EXACT. TERM SOUL SECURITY NUMBERS. WE USE THEM THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM ALLSTATE USE SOME THROUGHOUT THEIR SYSTEM THERE'S NOT. ONE STATE IN OUR UNION THAT DOES NOT USE SOAP SECURITY NUMBERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. OF THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. THAT'S CORRECT BUT FILE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE WITH THE STATE -- MY MONTHLY PAYCHECK COMES WITH EX SAYS AND THE LAST FOUR SOCIAL THAT DIGITS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OTHERS THOUGH BEING IDENTIFIED BECAUSE OF THAT THOSE ARE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THEN AND I AM TRYING TO GET TO WHERE I THINK THAT YOU WANT TO BE AND I'D LIKE TO BE THERE. MY DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED. ZERO DOLLARS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PAST -- TWO AUGMENTATIONS TO MY BUDGET TO REPLACE THE BENEFITS SYSTEM -- VOTE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT DISABILITY PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO DO THAT. AT TO REPLACE ALL SECURITY NUMBERS WHEN MISS BAKER FIRST BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP WE RAN THE NUMBERS. TO WITH THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THE ANTIQUITY OF OUR SYSTEM. ACOSTA ST ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS -- AND IT WOULD GO BACK THROUGH THE CDT PROCESS THE STATE'S GOOD PROCESS WHICH IN. MY ESTIMATION FIVE FIVE SIX YEARS I DON'T I'M THAT'S MY DESTINATION. BUT WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT -- I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE I'M TRYING TO GET THERE YOU AUGMENTED MY BUDGET SO THAT WE CAN GET THERE WERE ALONG THE PROCESS [inaudible] BEING THERE -- AND RIGHT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE YOU SAID THAT 3240% -- YOU'VE REMOVED IT THAT INFORMATION AND FROM 3240% OF THE DOCUMENTS. I'M WELL HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO FOLKS THAT -- IDENTITY THEIR IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN -- WITH I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET AYE IT'S THESE THIS POPULATION IS ALREADY VULNERABLE IF THERE ARE GOING TO ANY PROCESS TO EDT I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE ALREADY. EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR THEY'RE THEY'RE IN THAT VULNERABLE TO IT SITUATION AND TO ADD THAT AND THIS IS ME YOU MIGHT YOU MADE THE COMMENT. DIED -- IDENTITY THEFT TIME CONSUMING THESE FOLKS ALREADY IN THE VOTE VULNERABLE STATE. AND FOR US TO BE ARE EXPOSING THEIR INFORMATION JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT AND I CAN APPRECIATE THE BUDGET QUESTIONED BY I'M JUST A NORMAL PERSON AND COMPUTE I MEAN I CAN. WITH MY PHONE. YEAH THERE'S WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT I CAN DO AND SO IT JUST DOESN'T FIT IN MY COMPREHENSION HOW. OUGHT WE CAN'T JUST CODE SOMETHING TO REMOVE -- THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU. THE BENEFIT SYSTEM THAT WE WILL HAVE IN OUR STATE WILL BE THE LARGEST. IN OUR COUNTRY. AND WHAT I WILL WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THIS GOING TO COST SOMEWHERE AROUND. IT'S GONNA COST A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY -- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS -- WHAT? WHAT I'LL TELL YOU THAT WE ARE MARCHING DOWN THE PATH TO GET THERE? WE HAVE ALREADY SET A COURSE TO GET TO THAT PLACE A PLACE OF THEIR OWN TO OUR THING INDICATE QUICK SOLUTION IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN MENTIONED TO ME MADE WHICH IS BY. PAPER WITH HOLES PUNCHED IN IT MAYBE WEEK THERE'S MAYBE THERE'S A LOW TECH SOLUTION THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH. THEY ALL COST MONEY. AND IF I DON'T HAVE MONEY ALLOCATED TO ME WHICH OFTENTIMES SUSAN EDUCATION A PRIORITY THEN. BUT I'M FACED WITH THE DILEMMA WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT OF OF WHAT IS THE PRIORITY FOR RUNNING. OUR SYSTEMS WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT KEEPING THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM PAYING BENEFITS. TO CALIFORNIANS AS YOU DESCRIBE THAT ARE ON THOSE FRINGES IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ME. WE HAVE RECEIVED THE BEST RATINGS FOR THE SOLE SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WHO COMES OUT AND IT'S BY ANNUAL AUDITS OF OUR SYSTEM. AND THEY SAY AND THEY TELL ME THAT WE RECEIVED THE THAT WE ARE THE PAST OKAY SO IT THEN. PEOPLE'S INFORMATION THAT I QUESTION TO YOU ROADS ARE ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE AUDIT THAN. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE ALREADY GOING THROUGH A SYSTEM THAT IT WHETHER OR NOT I'M OKAY WITH THE AUDIT FRANKLY IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT -- I GET TO DECIDE I'VE QUIT YOU DECIDE WHERE WE'RE HERE TO TO HEAR YOUR OF LEADING INTO THE FIGHT GOT TO DECIDE AT A FRANKLY WOULD BE SPENDING MY TIME AND I WOULD THINK THAT. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU GUYS COULD FOCUS ON THAT A FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT SECTION WELL IT'S A TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AND IT LOOKED AT THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME AND OF WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOUR DECISION WHETHER. YOU RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT THE HIVE YES VERY LUCKY OF THE AUDITOR DESCRIBED IF YOU CAN LET ME ASK CONTINUE MY QUESTION I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATED. WHAT MY WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU TO YOU IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT THEIR IDENTITY IS BEING STOLEN THAT'S THEIR PRIORITY AND SO HOW CAN WE COME TOGETHER? TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE THEIR PRIORITIES AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IT'S JUST SOUNDS AGAIN I'M JUST A NORMAL PERSON AND TO ME IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A BIG DEAL. AND PERHAPS THERE IS THAT MONEY PROBLEM BUT WE CAN'T KEEP EXCUSING -- INEFFICIENCIES BASED ON ON BOND MONEY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT CAN. EITHER I DON'T KNOWSAVED SOME MONEY SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S AND EFFICIENCIES IN EVERY DEPARTMENT AND SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE INEFFICIENCIES CAN BE -- CORRECTED BUT THIS IS A BIG CONCERN AND IT SHOULD BE. YOUR NUMBER TWO PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS -- IDENTITIES ARE NOT BEING STOLEN SO JUST WITH THAT I APPRECIATED I KNOW WE'RE GONNA GO ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WE'RE GONNA COME TO A RESOLUTION ON THAT THE AUDITOR. ON STEPS AND THAT THEM BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU IS THAT IT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TO A BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS. IS GETTING THAT CHECK. AND I HAVE A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT YES BUT IF THEIR IDENTITIES STOLEN THOSE CHECKS ARE GONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PAYING -- OTHER -- WHEN THEIR IDENTITIES ARE STOLEN AND SOMEBODY'S CHARGING UP FOR EXAMPLE ON THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY THAT TECH WILL BE GONE BECAUSE CREDITORS WILL COME AFTER THEM WAS ALRIGHT THANK YOU I'M GOING TO STEP IN HERE I I THINK YOUR POSITIONS HAVE BEEN MADE CLEAR? ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MR HEADING FIRST LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE NICE JOB YOU. AT YOUR DEPARTMENTS IN THE SERVICE THAT YOU PROVIDE. TO PROBABLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY OLD -- AND I HAVE I HAVE THIS THING CALLED MEDICARE OF CARD. AND MEDICARE CARDS UNTIL RECENTLY HAD A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON THEM. AND WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO USING THEM AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE MAIL COMES THIS ENVELOPE FROM WHEREVER UP IN. WASHINGTON DC OR WHEREVER IT COMES FROM. AND I HAVE A NEW CARD. AND THEY I HAVE A NEW CARD BECAUSE THEY DELETED THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS FROM THE MEDICARE CARDS AND WE HAVE SOME NEW. MULTI DIGIT NUMBER AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DESTROY THE MEDICARE BECAUSE THE OLD ONE AND TO USE A NEW. SO I KNOW THIS CAN BE DONE. WHAT I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO REALLY. PINNED DOWN IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE. IN OUR BINDER HAVING TO DO WITH THE SUTTER. FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT. IS WHAT THAT BUT THE WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS WHAT THE TIMELINE IS AND WHAT THE DOLLARS ARE. I'VE SEEN I SEE SOME LETTERS FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT WE'RE NOW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THE THE STATE AUDITOR'S HERE TO HELP. JUST LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'D LIKE TO SEE A AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS OF PLAN TO GET TO THE POINT WERE ONE WE IDENTIFY ALL OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT CAN BE SCRUBBED. AND OF AND CHANGED TO OTHER. DIGITAL ADDENDA FIRES. TO THE COST FOR THAT -- AND THREE A TIMELINE. I'M SOMEWHAT BECAUSE OF MY TIME UP HERE I CONTINUE TO SERVE ON A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IT HAS TO DO WITH IT PROJECTS SO I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE AND SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE COST AND THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE RATE. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS WHAT THE DOLLARS INVOLVED ARE. AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET YOU SOME MONEY. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IT CAN BE SCRUBBED OUR SCRIPT I REALIZE THAT US SOMETIMES WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYER RETURNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED USE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BUT THAT. SITUATION AND THOSE FORMS SHOULD BE. OF LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE SO. I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE I REQUEST TODAY I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT FROM YOU AND MAYBE THE AUDITOR CAN. YOU TWO CAN GET TOGETHER AND PUT THAT TOGETHER SO WE HAVE THAT TO CONSIDER AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE BUDGET FORMULATION. FOR A 200-019-2000.

I WILL THE SENATE TODAY WITH MY CO AUTHOR AND COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMAN JIM PATTERSON ON A REQUEST TO AUDIT. THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. RIDLEY THE WAIT TIMES HAVE INCREASED. AND PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING AVERAGE WAYS OF UP TO FIVE HOURS ON ROUTINE SERVICES. EVEN IF YOU BOOK AN APPOINTMENT MONTHS IN ADVANCE. THROUGH THE DMP WEBSITE CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL FACE WAITING LONG HOURS. IT SENDS ME THAT THE REASON FOR THIS AUDIT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF CONSTITUENTS THAT CONTACT MY OFFICE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES AT YOUR LOCAL DMV'S. IN FACT I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A CONSTITUENT THAT OUR DAUGHTER FAINTED WHILE WAITING IN LINE AT THE FOUR TO DMV AND SHE'S QUITE A DAUGHTER WITH WHITNEY OUTSIDE FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS WHEN SHE FAINTED. LUCKILY THERE WAS OTHERS IN LINE TO HELP CALL NINE ONE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME QUICKLY. BUT DESPITE ALL THIS SHE REFUSED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE SHE NEEDED HER REPLACEMENT LICENSE YOU KNOW ONCE HUESO THREE HOURS SHE OR HE SPENT IN LINE. DMV EMPLOYEES WATER JUST INSIDE FOR THE REST OF HER WEIGHT WHICH WAS AN ADDITIONAL. TWO HOURS. WHILE INSIDE SHE SPOKE TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE APPOINTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE [inaudible] SEVEN HOURS. THE DMV POSTSCRIPT WAIT TIMES FROM LOCAL FIELD OFFICES THE TIMES ARE ONLY MEASURED. THE MOMENT YOUR ISSUE THE TICKET NUMBER THAT TIME DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE HOURS SPENT OUTSIDE WAITING LINE TO GET A NUMBER. ACCORDING TO DMV THE INCREASE WE TYPES ARE PROBABLY DUTY IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL LIGHTING. WHICH STATES BUT TO CONTINUE TO TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT THIRTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE A STATE ISSUED DRIVER LICENSE OR IDENTIFICATION CARD. NO NO LONGER BE VALID FOR AIR TRAVEL AFTER OCTOBER FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY AND THE ONLY WAY. OBTAIN A REAL IDEAS TO GO TO GM OFFICE BEFORE THAT DEADLINE. I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY THERE WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION REGARDING LONG WAIT TIMES. THE DMV WASN'T ABLE TO GIVE CONCRETE TIMELINES ON WHEN THE WAIT TIMES WE GET SHORTER. WHAT PLANS THEY HAVE IN PLACE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM? MY CONCERN IS THAT DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE UNACCEPTABLY LONG WAIT TIMES I WAS WE PROACTIVE DO SOMETHING NOW. THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON ANY PLANS. TO HELP WITH THE WAIT TIMES AS WELL AS A DISTRUST OF THE DEPARTMENT. I HOPE THAT EVERY MEMBER HERE -- HAVE STOPPED YOU LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AUDIT IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. IT'S NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT IMPACTS ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THIS IS A CALIFORNIA WHITE ISSUE. REALLY GET DOWN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THE SOLUTION. WITH US AT ALL ON REFER TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE SO WE JIM PATTERSON. THANK YOU OUT MEMBERS AND THE AND THE CHAIRS THAT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT YESTERDAY. I IN THE BUDGET -- ACCOUNTABILITY HEARING WE FOUND THAT THE DMV IS REQUESTING A ADDITIONAL. A SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION UPPER ADDED STAFFING IS ALSO ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL. TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS ON TOP OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN FOR OUR THE PURPOSES OF GETTING THESE WAIT TIMES ARE REDUCED AND YET THE WAIT TIMES HAVE ACTUALLY EXPLODED. YESTERDAY WE HEARD A LOT OF EXCUSES -- WE DID LEARN THAT ALL OF THE ADDED FUNDING APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. HAS RESULTED IN ONLY ONE OR TWO NEW EMPLOYEES AT EACH LOCATION. THROWING MONEY AT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING TO FIX IT TO THE DEPTH OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE ARE UNCOVERING. WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW ASKING OURSELVES WHERE THE MONEY WENT. AND THE LINES ARE STILL OUT THE DOOR. THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE REQUESTING THE AUDIT FOR A DEEP. DIVE INTO THE DELAYS THAT ARE CAUSED BY A NUMBER OF PROBLEM AREAS. REAL ID IS ONE AS WELL AS A OUTDATED DEATH TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. THERE BEEN FAILURES OF FUNDAMENTAL PLANNING GOING BACK A YEARS AND THE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN UP FELT BOTH BY. CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS AND BY THE DILIGENT HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES OF THE DMP. YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED ALONG WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM OUTAGES. THE TIMES THAT THE DMV'S FORTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM CRASHES. CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS. THIS HAPPENED ON MONDAY ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALMOST A HALF A DAY. IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY BUT UPON DIRECT -- QUESTIONING OF THE DIRECTOR. WE COULD NOT DETERMINE THE FACTS. OUR SHE IS EITHER DID NOT KNOW THEM OR WERE UNWILLING TO UP. DISCUSS THEM WITH THIS IN ORDER TO TELL US THE SCOPE SIZE AND FREQUENCY OF THESE OUTAGES A THE THESE DETAILS MAY BE EMBARRASSING BUT THEY'RE NECESSARY FOR US TO FIND OUT AND WE THINK THAT THE AUDIT. HELPS US TO GET THERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE. A MASSIVE FAILURE OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT IS UNABLE TO FUNDAMENTALLY SERVE DRIVERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHICH IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING IF THERE WAS EVER A DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THE ISC BECAUSE CRYING OUT FOR AN AUDIT IT IS THE DM DE. WE HAVE A COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUAL TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. COLIN GRANT IS A MANAGER IN THE LOS ANGELES DMV OFFICE. HE'S BEEN THERE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HE HAS ALSO FILED A REPORT WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. AS A QUIZZLE BLOWER. HE KNOWS THE DMB SYSTEMS INSIDE AND OUT HE IS A PROFESSIONAL AND PASSIONATE LEADER WHO JUST SIMPLY HAS RUN OUT OF OPTIONS AND REALLY WANTS TO BE PART. OF MAKING THE KINDS OF SYSTEMIC WIDE RANGING CHANGES THAT THE THE DMB EMPLOYEE SEE EVERY DAY AND THE DM THE CUSTOMERS ARE EXPERIENCING. WITH LONG WAIT LINES. MEMBERS WE NEED TO COMMEND HIM FOR HIS BRAVERY AND I WANT. TO JIM TO KNOW THAT HE IS NOT ALONE THERE ARE MANY D. M. BEEP EMPLOYEES WE HAVE HEARD FROM THEIR MANY CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE TODAY. TO SHARE THEIR STORIES. COLIN WILL BE THE SPOKESMAN FOR THEM AND WE APPRECIATE HIM BEING HERE THE FACTS IN TESTIMONY TODAY WILL MAKE IT CLEAR. THE PROBLEMS ARE HUGE MULTI FACETED AND REQUIRE A DEEP AND SERIOUS AUDIT OF THE DMV WITHOUT. MISTER CULLEN GRANT [inaudible] SERVER. YOU STATE YOUR NAME CLEARLY FOR THE RECORD BEFORE YOU START AGAIN I APOLOGIZE AND ALSO. IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR OF REMARKS RELATIVELY BRIEF I REALIZE YOU HAVE A STORY TO TELL AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO TELL IT. BUT WE DO HAVE AN AGENDA HERE TODAY THAT I NEED TO MOVE SERVE SO MISTER GRANT YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU MAY PROCEED -- MY NAME IS COLIN GRANT -- I AMA MANAGER -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES IN THE LOS ANGELES FIELD OFFICE FOR FIELD OPERATIONS DIVISION. I FOLLOWED A WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINT WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND WAS COMPELLED TO CONTACT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON -- TO VOICE MY CONCERNS I MET HIM TO IMPROVE -- THE DMV FOR EVERYBODY. I HAVE BEEN AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND I HOPE TO WORK. FOR MUCH MORE YEARS TO COME. I STARTED WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS A MOTOR VEHICLE REPRESENTATIVE PROCESSING A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN A MANAGER NOW FOR LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF MY CAREER WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IT IS MY HOPE THAT MY TESTIMONY TODAY WEIGH HEAVILY ON THIS COMMITTEE'S DECISION TO RULE IN FAVOR OF AN EXTENSIVE AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS. WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL BRING TO LIGHT VIOLATIONS OF LAW. GROSS INEFFICIENCY GROSS INCOMPETENCE MISCONDUCT AND WASTE OF STATE RESOURCES. AS THE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DATELINE APPROVED APPROACHES THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS SEEKING TO OBTAIN THE REAL ID WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE LONG WAIT TIMES WILL BECOME EVEN MORE WORSE THAN WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. UNLESS THE ISSUES I AM GOING TO MENTION ARE DRESSED. THE REAL IDEA THE REAL ID IS ANOTHER HUGE WEIGHT ON A SYSTEM THAT IS ALREADY BUCKLING UNDER MAJOR SYSTEMIC FAILURES. REAL ID IS ONE OF THE BIG CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE EXCESS OF WAIT TIMES HOWEVER. IT WOULD BE AN EXTREME OVER EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT IS THE SOLE REASON AND THE BECAUSE BUT DIEM V. AUTOMATION DIEM VIS A WAS LAUNCHED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY IT IS STILL IN USE TODAY. LITERALLY REGISTRATION TRANSACTIONS ARE PROCESS ON A GREEN SCREEN COMMAND LINE INTERFACE. DIEM VIS A IS OVERLOADED AND FRAUGHT WITH GLITCHES PROGRAMMING ERRORS AND LIMITATIONS. ALL TOO OFTEN SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC WILL COME TO A COMPLETE STOP BECAUSE OF DIEM VA MOST RECENTLY THIS PAST MONDAY. THE EVENTS THIS THESE EVENTUALLY REQUIRE COMPUTERS TO BE REBOOTED. AND DMV PROGRAMMING TO BE RELOADED. IN FACT LAST YEAR'S MASSIVE OUTAGE OUTAGE. WAS CAUSED BY COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE OF DMV A IT IS A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE TO IMPLEMENT NEW LAWS USING DIEM VA. THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD TO CREATE SEVERAL SUB SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ENTERPRISE APPLICATION SERVICES ENVIRONMENT E. HE'S -- DOCUMENT AUTHENTICATION DEVICES DADS -- FILLED OFFICE DOCUMENT IMAGING FOTI -- TH PHOTO IMAGE RETRIEVAL. FOREIGN DOCUMENT VERIFICATION FINGERPRINT CAPTURE AND ELECTRONIC DEAL FORTY FOR RETRIEVAL AND SO ON A SINGLE APPLICATION FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE CAN REQUIRE A TECHNICIAN TO TALK WILL THROUGH ALL THE SUBSYSTEMS AND HAVE TO ENTER THEIR USER NAME AND PASSWORD CREDENTIALS. FOR EACH TIME. THESE WORKAROUNDS OUR ALL TOO OFTEN FREQUENT AND USED TO COMPENSATE FOR IN NEARLY FORTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM. DIEM VA IS THE CORE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT HOUSES THE CORE DATA. FOR RECORDS FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE IDENTIFICATION CARDS REGISTRATION FOR VEHICLES AND VESSELS IN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING -- I DON'T BELIEVE IT FURTHER EXPLANATION IS NEEDED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT DMV IS INADEQUATE TO HANDLE. THE STATE'S BUSINESS NEARING THE YEAR -- TWENTY TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA MOTOR VEHICLE ACT IS ALSO CAUSING SEVERE DELAYS AND CONFUSION THE M. V. FIELD OFFICES. WITH THE PUSH TO IMPLEMENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE WITH THE INADEQUATE SYSTEM IN PLACE. IT NOW THERE'S EXTREME BOTTLE NECKING THAT IS OCCURRING FOR A LOT OF THE CUSTOMERS. IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT PHASED OUT PAPER APPLICATIONS FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS. ONLY CUSTOMERS WITH ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY ARE PARTICIPANTS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S AT HOME SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM. RECEIVE PAPER APPLICATIONS ALL OTHER CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN ELECTRONIC APPLICATION AT A TOUCH SCREEN TERMINAL. OR ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE WHICH WAS NOT OPERATIONAL AT ROLLOUT. THE MOTOR -- THE MOTOR VOTER ACT HAS SUCCESSFULLY REGISTERED NEW VOTERS HOWEVER IT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES FOR THE EXCESS OF WAIT TIMES. MOST FILLED OFFICES DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF T. S. TEASE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF CUSTOMERS APPLYING FOR DRIVER'S LICENSES AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS. APPLICATION PROCESSING TIMES HAVE INCREASED ON CONSIDERABLY. TECHNICIANS ARE TASKED WITH RETRIEVING VERIFYING IN MAKING ANY NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION. THAT WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE USING GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER. THEN THE TECHNICIAN HAS TO TOGGLE OVER TO A MONTH ZILLA FOXFIRE BROWSER TO COMPLETE PROCESSING OF THE APPLICATION FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE. USING THE EXACT SAME INFORMATION. MOVING ON TO THE CUSTOMER FLOW SYSTEM. CFS IS THE DEPARTMENT'S NEW TICKET LISTS NUMBER SYSTEM TO CALL CUSTOMERS TO A WINDOW. IT WAS UNVEILED EARLIER THIS YEAR. CFS -- WAS FAR FROM COMPLETION IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT. IT WAS -- IT WAS A MAJOR REASON WHY THERE ARE LONG LINES OF SOMETIMES OVER A HUNDRED CUSTOMERS SIMPLY WAITING TO OBTAIN A TICKET. PRIOR TO CFS A REPRESENTATIVE AT A START HERE WINDOW ONLY HAD TO PRESS ONE BUTTON ON THE THERMAL PRINTER. TO ISSUE A TICKET TO A CUSTOMER. CFS COHEN -- REQUIRES COLLECTION OF INFORMATION NAME PHONE NUMBER PURPOSE OF VISIT FROM THE CUSTOMER WHICH IS ENTERED INTO THE CFS SYSTEM TO GENERATE A UNIQUE NUMBER FOR THE CUSTOMER. CUSTOMERS WERE OFTEN CONFUSE WAITING FOR A COMBINATION OF THEIR INITIALS IN THE LAST FOUR DIGITS AT THEIR PHONE NUMBER TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. MISS MISTER GRANT. MR GRANTS MAY APPEAR -- MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE IF THE OTHER DISAPPROVED TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE STATE AUDITOR. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT YOUR WRITTEN COMMENTS OF FOR THE RECORD IF YOU'D LIKE TO SUBMIT THEM IN THERE MAY BE SOME FOLKS OUT -- OUT THERE THAT MAY WANT TO COPY AS WELL. I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO TRY TO WRAP IT UP -- WERE APPROACHING. ABOUT THREE TIMES THE NORMAL TIME LIMIT THE TO CHAIR ALLOWS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD HELP HIM BEFORE I GIVE HIM THE GAVEL BACK HERE HOW ABOUT THAT OKAY WELL LET ME GO AHEAD -- WAS THAT WAS SUBMIT IN WRITING TO THE MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD -- ONE THE MV EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH WITH INADEQUATE TOOLS FOR MANY MANY YEARS -- HIRING OF NEW EMPLOYEES WILL HOPE I WILL HELP BUT THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HIRE THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM -- IF THESE IS SYSTEMIC ISSUES ARE NOT ADDRESSED -- THE LINES WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN WITH THE INFLUX OF CUSTOMERS SEEKING THE RELY D. AS THE OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY ARE DEADLINE APPROACHES. I URGE ALL OF YOU TO APPROVE THE AUDIT TODAY -- THESE CONDITIONS ARE UNBEARABLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FOR DIEM THE EMPLOYEES -- AN EXTENSIVE AUDIT IS THE ONLY WAY TO BRING ALL THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN BE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED -- IN THE EVENT OF AN AUDIT I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. TO ADVISE IN AN OBJECT OF OBJECTIVELY IDENTIFYING THE CAUSE AND VIABLE REMEDIES TO FOR THESE EXTREME WAIT TIMES. WITH THANK YOU MISTER GRANT WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN US TODAY AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. A MISTER CHAIR YOU'RE READY FOR THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH US OUT HER -- FOR SHARING VIA. COMMITTEE HEARING IN MY ABSENCE OF STATE AUDITOR -- WHICH PLEASE MAKE YOUR PRESENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS A MEMBERS INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF DMV FIRST OBJECTIVE IS LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE WAIT TIMES AND THE INFORMATION THAT D. M. V.. A PRESENTS ON ITS WEBSITE AND THEY'RE ASKING US TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF THAT INFORMATION THAT'S BEING SHARED PUBLICLY ON ITS WEBSITE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY LOOKING AT WHAT STEPS HAVE THEY TAKEN AS AS EVERYTHING'S BEEN IN THE MEDIA WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE CAN. INTENDING TO EXTEND HOURS AT CERTAIN OFFICES NOW HAVE SATURDAY HOURS ON IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHAT OTHER IT -- STEPS HAS DMB TAKE INTERTRIGO REDUCE WAIT TIMES IN ADDITION TO THAT WHETHER THEY INTEND TO DO AS FAR AS EVALUATING ARE THOSE EXTENDED HOURS WORKING ARE THEY REDUCING WAIT TIMES BY HOW MUCH. WHAT OTHER MEASURES DO THEY NEED TO TAKE GOING FORWARD -- ARE THEY GOING TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THE NEW OUR EXTENDED WEEKDAY HOURS AND CERTAINLY THE WEEKEND HOURS ALSO THE MEMBERS ARE ASKING US TO LOOK AT HAS DMV. ARE BASICALLY DIVERTED RESOURCES FROM OTHER FUNCTIONS AND HAS THAT HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO GET COMMERCIAL DO. TYPES OF SERVICES FROM DMV BECAUSE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DIVERTED THEY'RE ASKING US TO LOOK AT THAT AFFECT -- ALSO ASKING US TO SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT REAL ID -- WHETHER WAIT TIMES HAVE INCREASED HAVE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY HAS THAT DAY DECREASED SINCE THEY'VE STARTED -- TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE RELATED TO REAL ID. I'M TRYING TO DO SOME ANALYSIS BASED ON LOCATION AND WHAT IS D. M. V. DOING TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE LOCATIONS DID WE DID THEY DECIDE TO EXTEND HOURS HAVE SATURDAY HOURS. ARE SATURDAY -- AVAILABILITY AND HOW DID THEY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND HOT WILL THEY COURSE CORRECT THAT IF THAT IS REALLY NOT -- AFFECTING ANY CHANGE OR IMPROVING SERVICES FOR CONSTITUENTS -- SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES RELATED TO REAL ID FIRST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE DMV'S PLANTS KEEP IN MIND THAT REAL ID WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN ON NOTICE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER STATES. THAT THIS HOUSE TO BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE STATE ASKED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT EXTENSION SO REALLY WHAT WAS DMV'S PLANNING PROCESS. DETERMINING WHAT ANTICIPATING WHAT THE WORKLOAD WOULD BE HOW WOULD THEY ROLL OUT REAL ID HOW WOULD THEY EDUCATE OUR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINE. TO UP WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO WHAT MATERIALS THEY NEED TO BRING TO D. M. V. TO BE ABLE TO GET A REAL IDEA NEW LICENSE. ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRED TO CERTIFY OUR STATE AS COMPLIANT WITH REAL ID. THE MEMBERS WANT US TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT'S THE STATUS OF OUR COMPLIANCE ARE WE ARE WILL WE BE IN COMPLIANCE. ARE WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXPECTS US TO DO WITH RESPECT TO HIRING -- WHAT'S THE STATUS OF HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES AS AS MISTER PATTERSON INDICATED LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED FUNDING OFF HOW MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE THEY HIRED HAVE THE ADEQUATELY TRAIN THOSE EMPLOYEES. HOW DID THEY DETERMINE WHERE TO PLACE THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE VARIOUS DISTRICT OFFICES WAS THAT THE BEST A DECISION MADE? AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO OUTREACH WHAT TYPES OF OUTREACH HAVE THEY CONDUCTED -- ARE THE MATERIALS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE ARE THEY EDGE ARE EVALUATING EXCUSE ME EVALUATING HOW WELL THAT'S WORKING AND AGAIN ARE THEY MAKING. ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS THAT COME TO A DMV OFFICE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE LETTER AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN IN THE MEDIA AS PEOPLE WAIT IN LINE ALL DAY AND THEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT. DESK AND THEY GET TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE WRONG DOCUMENTS SO WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH IN EDUCATING OUR HAS DMV BEEN DOING AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T PRODUCT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. AND THEN ALSO LAST OBJECTIVE LOOKING OUT THE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE THEY CLEAR ARE THEY ACCURATE AGAIN ARE THEY AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE THEY MAKING IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GET A NEW REAL ID OUR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR OUR CARD -- THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT IS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS THAT WOULD TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE NEEDED TO GET IT DONE MORE QUICKLY. IS -- ASSIGN. COUPLE OF TEAMS TO THIS BECAUSE MY EXPECTATION IS WE WOULD SPEND TIME AT HEADQUARTERS BUT CERTAINLY GET OUT THERE STE TO SOME DISTRICT OFFICES. GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS OF AUDITING DO SOME OBSERVATION OF PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE -- CERTAINLY WOULD DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO NOT GET IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE PROVIDING SERVICES TO CONSTITUENTS BUT CERTAINLY WOULD NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MANAGEMENT. BUT AS WE DO WITH ANY AUDIT WE WOULD BE RESPECTFUL OF YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT'S TIME ETCETERA SO AGAIN MISTER CHAIR IT WOULD TAKE US SEVEN MONTHS. ARE IF THE COMMITTEE I WAS INTERESTED IN US ETTING THIS DONE MORE QUICKLY THAT IF IT IS APPROVED WE CAN CERTAINLY I I JUST ABOUT THE TEAM IN THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE WOULD GO FORWARD WITH THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES PLEASE COME FORWARD AND PRESENT YOUR CASE [inaudible] AND DEATH.

A WERE ABLE TO GET OUR CUSTOMERS IN EARLIER IN THE MORNING AND START THE DAY OF AND THEN ON SATURDAY SERVICE WE STARTED THAT EXTENDED UP TO SIXTY OFFICES LAST ARITY. WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMERS COMING TO OFFICE ON SATURDAY WHICH TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF THE OFFICES DURING THE WEEKDAY AND THAT WE WANT TO SEE. OF THERE IS DATA IN REAL TIME THAT IS BEING REPORTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND OUR TEAM IS FOCUSED ON THREE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OFFICE THE LINE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENT -- DID YOU HAVE A THE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY HERE IS NOT TO OKAY YOU'RE HERE FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS ALRIGHT LET ME OPEN IT UP FOR A OF THE COMMITTEE STARTING WITH THE VICE CHAIR CENTER ROTH. YOU KNOW FROM A GOOD MORNING. IT'S IT'S THE MORNING. YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR A FROM FOR GOVERNMENT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS JOB NUMBER. ONE AND WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET A QUALITY AWARD ON THIS ONE JEFF. LOOK BUT LET ME ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO REPORT TO THE DMV OFFICE. TO RENEW A DRIVER'S LICENSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS PERIODICALLY YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT. HOLE FOR AN ADVANCE DOES THE DMV SEND OUT THE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE ZOOMER THE DRIVER THAT. IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE HERE SHE HAS TO REPORT TO THE DMV OFFICE. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW THEY GET MAILED OUT I SUCCEED WE START THE PRICES ON NINETY DAYS IN ADVANCE A IT'S A AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH WE ARE CHANGING THAT PROCESS WHERE THERE COULD BE MAILED OUT HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE SO IS IT SIXTY DAYS NOW. WAS IT SIXTY DAYS OR NINETY YOU KNOW HOW UGLY I RUN THE PROGRAM PRINT THE INFORMATION MAIL IT OUT SO. I WE START THE PROCESS AT NIGHT DAYS AND THE CRESSMAN WILL PROBABLY GET IN THE MAIL UP BETWEEN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE DAYS. SO SIXTY DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE DAY. THAT YOUR LICENSE EXPIRES OR LESS YOU'LL GET A NOTICE IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO REPORT TO THE DMV OFFICE. CORRECT AND SO WE ARE. CHANGING THAT TO NINETY DAYS WHAT'S THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME TODAY. IN THE SYSTEM TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. AT THE DMV OFFICE SO I OUT WE LOOK AT IT JUST YESTERDAY AND WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING IT THEIR THEIR APPOINTMENT CENTER OUT TO A COUPLE NIGHTS AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF MAKING APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE. A ONE THING IS THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE APPOINTMENTS WOULD NOT APPOINTMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW MANY WE HAVE OUR WINDOWS OPEN AND SO. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT 2530% A APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE BETWEEN SERVING CUSTOMERS WITH APPOINTMENTS AND NOT APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WE MADE ALL APPOINTMENTS WERE NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE WALKING IN AND NOT APPOINTMENTS WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE TWO UGH. SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT IN TERMS OF WE CAN REDUCE THE WAIT TIMES UP FOR THE LONG APPOINTMENTS WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN -- MORE APPOINTMENTS SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT. A MOTORIST IN CALIFORNIA COULD A MOTORIST TO REPORT TO THE DMV. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN STE. FIFTY AND SIXTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE LICENSE AND THE MOTORIST NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DMV OFFICE WITHIN THAT TIME. POSSIBLY YES SO WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS THAT. LET ME TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AUDIT REQUEST. AROUND THIS BUILDING -- INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THAT WITHIN THE LAST THREE WEEKS I WAS STOPPED ON THE STREET IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE. BY A FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE. BUT MY PAY GRADE. WHO PROCEEDED TO REGALE ME WITH THE STORY ABOUT HAVING RECEIVED ONE OF THESE LETTERS HAVING THEN ATTEMPTED TO SECURE AN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE HE'S SORT OF A BUSY GUY? ADDED AS WE ARE OF COURSE NOT NO MATTER OF YOUR STATURE -- ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT THE DMV OFFICE WAS AND UNABLE TO DO SO AND THEN SPENT THE NEXT. FOUR FIVE OR SIX I FORGET EXACTLY HOURS WAITING AT THE DMV OFFICE TOO A OBTAIN A RENEWAL. OF HIS PARTICULAR DRIVER'S LICENSE. NOW IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHETHER HE IS OR WAS A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE OR THE CUSTODIAN AT THE STATE BUILDING IN WHICH WE HAVE AN OFFICE. THAT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT IS CONCERNING TO ME IS THE FACT THAT WE SEND A LETTER THE LETTER PROBABLY SAYS YOU CAN CALL AND GET AN APPOINTMENT. YOU CANNOT SECURE AN APPOINTMENT YOU GO TO A D. M. V. OFFICE IN YOU THEN PARK IN A CHAIR ASSUMING THERE IS A CHAIR. FOR HOURS ON END WAITING TO GET A LICENSE THAT WE MANDATE YOU HAVE AND IF YOU DON'T WE PENALIZE YOU. THAT'S NOT THE WAY GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK AND I'M NOT FAULTING YOU MA'AM YOU HAVE SOME VERY DEDICATED WORKERS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES I KNOW THEY WORK VERY VERY HARD. I'M PERHAPS WAS NOT THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO HAVE THE WE NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE NEED TO TAKE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST TO FIX IT. IF IT'S NOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE APPROVED WE NEED TO HAVE A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. AUGMENT THE BUDGET AND GET YOU THE MONEY [inaudible] ASAP. THE PROBLEM AND I'M NOT SURE THE END OF THE YEAR WORKS. SO. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME MISTER CHAIR THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND ANSWER MY QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE MISTER OBERNOLTE NEXT FOLLOWED BY MR ACOSTA IS RUBIO AND CENTER LARA. THAT THEY CAN MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SO. BUT I'M VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I REMEMBER THAT LAST YEAR. WHEN WE WERE ANTICIPATING THAT REAL ID MIGHT CAUSE INCREASED WORKLOADS THE DMV? THAT WE APPROPRIATE AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE DEPARTMENT ASKED. FOR PREPARE FOR THAT AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY THINGS THAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH THAT MONEY WAS CHIU INSTITUTE. SATURDAY ALL -- HOURS AT SIXTY FIELD OFFICES SIMONI A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID SOMETHING REALLY ALARMING WHICH IS THAT. IT ONLY LAST WEEK DO WE ACTUALLY GET THOSE OFFICE HOURS OPENED IS IS THAT THE CASE BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN JANUARY YES SO WHEN WE EMPLOYMENT WILL I BE IN JANUARY WE DID OPEN ON SATURDAY -- WE DID NOT SEE THE VOLUME OF WILL LIKELY CUSTOMERS COMING IN AND SO IT WASN'T NOT A VERY OUT WITHOUT DOWN. DATA BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE NOT COMING IN EMPLOYEES I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORK TO KEEP THEM BUSY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THAT WE GET SUSPENDED BUT WE DID READ THAT BRING BACK ON STUDIES OUT OF SAUDI SERVICE HOURS AND IN JUNE ON THE IN FORTY OFFICES. ON THE FIRST AND THIRD CHARITIES IN IN JULY INCREASE THAT TO FORTY THREE OFFICES AND THE FIRST AND THIRD SATURDAYS AND THN JUST LET IN AUGUST WE'VE CONTINUE. OUT GOT SIXTY OFFICES OPEN EIGHT TO FIVE UP ALL DAY OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO WE WERE MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AYE AND PART OF IT IS THAT WE HAD TO GET SOME LEASES IN PLACE TO EXPAND SORRY SERVICE AND I LEAST OFFICES. AND WE HAVE TO NOTIFY THE AND FUND THE UNION THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK IN PLACE ON SATURDAY SO WE HAVE TO INFORM THE UNION CHEN FIVE EMPLOYEES SO WE HAVE TO DO TO END IN STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON SATURDAY. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO A KEEPING THOSE SIXTY ON SO YOU STARTED. FIELD OFFICE HOURS ON SATURDAY. YOU DIDN'T SEE THE DEMAND FOR THEM AND SO YOU CURTAIL THEM AND THEN RECENTLY HAVE BROUGHT THEM BACK. YES SO WORTH THE WAIT TIMES WHEN AT THE OFFICES WHEN YOUR COUNTRY CURTAIL THEM. MADE IT JUST THE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF EVEN IF THE DEMAND FOR REAL ID WASN'T THERE BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SERVICE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE DMV. FOR IT SO THAT WE WILL BE DEBT RECOGNIZE THAT -- WE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE A REDUCE THOSE HOURS OR OR STOP THOSE HOURS WE ARE BROUGHT THEM BACK IMMEDIATELY AND SO I WERE WORKING TO REDUCE THOSE WAIT TIMES WAIT AND WE ARE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WAS A AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK HIGH TO AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES SO IF THATTHE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED MONEY FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND WE THERE WAS CURTAILED THE SOME OF THAT MONEY LEFT WHAT WE USE THAT WE WERE ALSO WORKING ADDITIONAL OVERTIME SO -- THE MONEY THAT WAS NEEDS FOR SELF SERVICE THAT WE WERE NOT USING -- WAS SPENT ON OVERTIME FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. SO THE MONEY'S GONE. MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT A OKAY WELL I I FIND THAT A LITTLE DISTURBING I I WISH THAT IF WE IF WE APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR CERTAIN PURPOSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT I FEEL LIKE USED OF OPEN THE THE FIELD OFFICE HOURS -- THE FIELD OFFICES ON SATURDAYS AND KEPT THEM OPEN AND MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE -- MADE THIS PROBLEM A LITTLE BIT LESS SEVERE BUT IT UNITED SOME A DISCUSSION YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS AND I I VERY STRONGLY FEEL THAT -- OUR CONSTITUENTS REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WHY THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THE WHAT. BEYOND FOR BETTER FOR WORSE. INTERACTION WITH THE DM V. IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY TOUCH POINTS THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE WITH THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE. THOUSANDS OF STATE DEPARTMENTS AND YET OUR AVERAGE CONSTITUENT WILL PROBABLY ORDER THE INTERACTION YOU OVER THE COURSE OF YEAR WITH WITH ONE OR TWO AND ONE OF THOSE IS PROBABLY A DMP SO. THEY ARE COLORING THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF OUR ENTIRE STATE GOVERNMENT BY. THEIR EXPERIENCES AT THE VARIANCES ARE NOT GIVING THEM A VERY POSITIVE VIEW OF THE WAY THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS SERVING THEM SO. BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS FIXED -- IMMEDIATELY I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ON AUDIT. IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT'S PUNITIVE IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PUNITIVE WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WORTH A BOTTLE NECKS ARE. AND GET THEM FIXED I THINK THE AUDITOR HAS RESOURCES THAT MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE IN IDENTIFYING THOSE PROBLEMS AND I LEADING YOU TOWARDS A SOLUTIONS ON A SUPPORT THE AUDIT TODAY BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU THAT WERE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE. AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TO SLAP YOUR HAND OR TELL YOU THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S TERRIBLE AND IT'S GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION. THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ACOSTA. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND UP AND AND THANK YOU TO THE TO THE OF AUTHORS OF THIS -- I REQUEST WAS OF THIS AUDIT AMISH YOU MOTO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE NO CAN'T BE THE SEE TWO DAYS IN A ROW POINT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS -- SO I I I I YOU KNOW I I HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR YOU. YOU KNOW IN THAT REGARD -- HOWEVER AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER OBERNOLTE APPOINTED OUT. YOU KNOW ARE CONSTITUENTS SEE THE OF THE FORWARD FACING OF GOVERNMENT IN. MANIFEST ITSELF PRIMARILY ONE WAY AND I AND I BELIEVE IT'S PRIMARILY THE ENVY -- WE REGISTER OUR CARS ANNUALLY -- WE'VE TRIED TO CHANGE THAT THE PAST WE WE DO OUR DRIVER'S LICENSES AND OTHER OTHER THINGS -- AND IT IT WHEN IT GOES BADLY IT IT TENDS TO GO VERY BADLY AND THEM AND THEY COME BACK TO US. ARE AMONG THE TOP COMPLAINTS IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE OUR DMV AND ATV AND IT'S IRONIC I GUESS A NOT SO MUCH THAT WE HAD BOTH OF THEM HERE TODAY WITHOUT REQUESTS. WHILE LOOKING AT VARIOUS UP PIECES OF THOSE -- THOSE DEPARTMENTS. AND I I DID WATCH THE MAJORITY OF THE VERY LONG HEARING YESTERDAY I WAS IN A MEMBER OF THE OF THAT THOSE THOSE COMMITTEES BUT I DID TAKE THE TIME TO TO WATCH IT -- AND AND I I I THINK THERE WAS SOME TROUBLING THINGS THEREIN AND TO SAVE PEOPLE TIME -- THAT DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO WATCH I'M GONNA ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF THE REPEATS OF YESTERDAY -- IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME VERY TROUBLING ISSUES HERE I'M THAT PIGGYBACK OFF OF WHAT WHAT MR OBERNOLTE IT JUST -- ASK YOU AND THAT WAS THAT'S ABOUT SATURDAY HOURS -- E. KNOW AYE AYE I WASN'T AWARE THAT WE STARTED THEM IN JANUARY AND THEN WE CURTAIL THEM -- THAT IS INFORMATION I THINK IS IS IS ALSO VERY TROUBLING -- I DRIVING BY MY LOCAL DMV OFFICE IN MY DISTRICT IN MY HOMETOWN. OF THE NEW HALL OFFICE IT USED TO BE THE OFFICE EVERYONE WENT TO FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BECAUSE IT WAS THE QUIET SLEEPY LITTLE OFFICE HASN'T BEEN THAT WAY IN MANY MANY YEARS. AND EVERY TIME I DRIVE BY THIS OFFICE OTHERS LINES OUT THE DOOR AROUND THE BLOCK NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS THE LAST FEW -- WEEKS -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND FRANKLY THROUGHOUT THE WEST WE'VE HAD SOME VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES WITH TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS I IN A HUNDRED AND I PROBABLY BUT HUNDRED TWELVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN DEGREES. AND WE HAD PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE OF A VERY SMALL THE IN THE OFFICE THAT IS A WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FOR THE FOR THE AREA -- JUST TO GET INSIDE AND AND THE pTHAT -- YOU'D YOU TRACK WAIT TIMES AND NOW YOU YESTERDAY YOU MENTIONED AND ALSO RECORDED TODAY AND IN THE NEWSPAPER -- THAT. IT THE WAIT TIMES FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN APPOINTMENT OR TWENTY THREE MINUTES IN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT OR AN HOUR TWENTY THREE MINUTES. AND I WOULD -- AYE I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TO MULTIPLE THE IN THE OFFICES ARE IN AND OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT. AND I'M NOT COUNTING THE WAIT TIME OUTSIDE I'M TALKING ABOUT ONCE YOU WALK IN THAT DOOR. EITHER IT THAT'S IT THAT'S JUST A STATISTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR DATA I'M -- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PLAYED CHANT CHANCE TO REBUT THIS BUT BACK TO THE SATURDAY HOURS -- HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHICH HOURS WHICH OFFICES TO OPEN ON SATURDAYS I UNDERSTAND IT SIXTY AND WE HAVE HOW MANY OFFICES TO ORDER HADN'T SEMICHA OFFICES SO I KNOW THAT WE TOOK A QUICK CENSUS I MISTER MISTER WOODS MISTER ON IT SO SHE'S AN AND MY DISTRICTS -- IN VERY POPULATED. THESE AT ALL -- THAT THOSE ARE AREAS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY EACH SERVE YOU KNOW ARE ALMOST TWO MILLION A MILLION HALF PEOPLE. AND THERE'S NO SATURDAY OFFICE HOURS WHATSOEVER -- HOW DID YOU COME ABOUT THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING WHICH OFFICES HAVE SENATE OFFICES WERE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR WAIT TIMES IN AND? I ALSO THEIR HIGH VOLUME DRIVER'S LICENSE OFFICES AND THERE IS SOME OFFICE SO WE LOOK AT THE PROFILE SUMMER MORE HEAVY IN VICTORIA VEHICLE REGISTRATION IT'S ON MORE. HIGH PROFILE A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THAT'S THE CRITERIA ALSO WAS LOOK AT JIM JUST YOU TO THINK THE STATE. OUT WORD OF WORD IS AND WHAT THE STUDY SERVICE OFFICE SO THAT OUT WE HAD THEM SPACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ANOTHER THING EXACT AND THE EMPLOYEES OUT OF WORK IN THIS ANY SERVICE IT'S VOLUNTARY OVERTIME IN MANDATORY OVERTIME WE PULL FROM THE SURROUNDING OFFICES DISTAFF POLICE STAFF OF THE OFFICE WITH EVERY WINDOW OPENS WE PULL FROM THE OTHER OFFICES. PROVIDE A FULL SERVICE ON SAUDI SERVICE AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE GET ENOUGH EMPLOYEES TO MAN IN OFFICE OF VERSES ABOUT WE OPENED ALL THE OFFICE IS A EVERY STUDY -- IT BE MANDATORY OVERTIME FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT WOULD DEATHLY PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON THIS EMPLOYEES INTERNS BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOB DONE. A EVERY DAY INCLUDE SORRY SO THAT'S IT THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. US YOU FOR OUR EMPLOYEES A WHOLE LIFE IN IN BALANCING OUT WORKING THERE OF PROVIDING SANTEE SERVICE SURE I I UNDERSTAND THAT. WE ALL HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT -- IN ORDER TO BALANCE THEIR HOMEWORK LIVES THEY THEY OFTEN WORK YOU KNOW SIX DAYS A WEEK SOMETIMES SEVEN DAYS A WEEK -- SO I THINK THAT'S GONNA FALL ON DEAF EARS THE MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SEVENTY NINE TO BE SEVENTY NINE TENS BY DOLLARS. BUT ON ON OVERTIME SO IF YOU FOR SATURDAY HOURS THAT YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THOSE OFFICES OPEN SO I'M I'M REALLY TROUBLED TO HEAR THAT. WE'VE SPENT MONEY FOR SATURDAY OFFICE HOURS THAT WAS FOR MANDATORY AND VOLUNTARY OVERTIME AND YET THAT MONEY IS NOW GONE BUT WE DIDN'T COMPLETE THE MISSION OF HAVING SATURDAY SERVICES AND WE ONLY HAD SAY. OUT OF ONE SEVENTY TWO ROUGHLY -- YOU KNOW 3538% OF THE OFFICES ARE EVEN OPEN AT THOSE TIMES AND WE UP APPROPRIATE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS LEGISLATURE TO DO IT -- I'M I'M GONNA ASK TO MOVE THIS AUDIT I'M AND I DO HAVE JUST ANOTHER A QUICK QUICK QUESTION -- THE YOU KNOW. YOU MENTIONED YESTERDAY THAT YOU IN THE IN THE SHIFTED AND YET TODAY'S WHILE THE SHIP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY EMPLOYEES AROUND FROM HEADQUARTERS -- TO COMPLETE THESE YOU TO HELP WITH THE DRIVER'S LICENSES I'M ANNA AND REAL ID WHICH BY THE WAY I'M ALL OUT OF STATE FOR THE RECORD. AS WELL -- WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE AND AND FRANKLY MADAM YOU'VE BEEN YOUR POINTED NOVEMBER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN SO TWO THOUSAND THREE TWENTY THIRTEEN ACTION IS JUST FIVE OF THEM GOT A LITTLE BIT. YET ABOUT EIGHT YEARS YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION ALMOST FIVE YEARS AND YET WE STILL NOT PREPARED FOR IT -- THAT'S TROUBLING WHAT BACK TO THE QUESTION WHAT WERE THE EMPLOYEES THE TILTED FOR FORTY EMPLOYEES YOU SHIFTED FROM HEADQUARTERS. INTO THE DISTRICT OFFICES DOING PRIOR TO THAT MOVING IN TO HELP WITH DRIVERS LICENSES. BUT THEY'RE DOING OF SOMEONE WHO ARE DOING A LITTLE WHO WORKS IN THE WORKING ON PROJECTS AND SO SUCH AS SUCH AS AYE NONSPECIFIC NAM OF THE WORKING OUT. THERE WORKING ON PROJECTS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE NEW STRATEGIES THAT ONE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AS SUCH AS LOOKING AT IF WE CAN AND DO SOME OF THE TESTING. AT HOME YOU WOULD DO IT -- TOO AT AT HOME THROUGH A COMPUTER WE KNOW THAT TWO OTHER STATES ARE ARE DOING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT STRATEGY -- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT EMPLOYEES THEY'RE DOING SOME PRODUCTION WORK ACT AND HEADQUARTERS TOUCHES ON WE DO A 100% REVIEW OF OUR THE CAR EVERY CAR THAT IS ISSUED WE DO A QUALITY REVIEW OF EVERY CARD WHICH IF SOME OF THOSE -- SOME EMPLOYEES ARE DOING SOME KEY ENTERING REMOVING SOME OF THOSE OVER OUT TO UP TO THE FIELD. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EMPLOYEES. THAT WERE DOING Q. SEE. AND SOME KIND OF ANALYTICAL WORK SO IT WAS SO WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT WERE -- IN OUR AND I DOING SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RESPONDING TO CORRESPONDENCE FROM CUSTOMERS REMOVE SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYEES OUT. AYE WE'VE MOVED -- SOME AND AB PEOPLE FROM MY REGISTRATION OPERATIONS YOU THAT DO SOME PRODUCTION WORK OF RESPONDING TO VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROCESS AS WE MOVE THOSE EMPLOYEES OUT. IT DONE AND OUT COVER ALL OUR DIVISIONS OUT WE HAVE SOME OF OUR INVESTIGATIVEOFFICE ASSISTANCE A LEAVE OF THOSE THAT THE ANSWER SOME OF THE PHONE CALLS IN HEADQUARTERS IN MOOD AND SOME OF THOSE OFFICE ASSISTANTS A OUT. TO ASSIST WITH THE NON PRODUCTION WORK TO BRING THE TRAIN PREDICTIONS BACK ON THE WINDOWS TO PROCESS CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE A NEED. AND THEN IDEA OF THE BALANCE COULD RIGHT NOW IN YOUR IN YOUR OFFICES ARE STATEWIDE. BETWEEN THEROUTINE THAT IS THE RE REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES PEOPLE THAT THAT DON'T PAY TO USE YOU KNOW -- SERVICE OR THAT ARE MEMBERS OF AN AUTO CLUB THAT CAN DO IT THERE -- THOSE ROUTINE SERVICES READ RE REGISTERING YOUR CAR ETCETERA -- AND THE FACT THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE GETTING THEIR NEW REAL LIFE HE'S. WHAT KIND OF BALANCES THAT IS IT FIFTY FIFTY IS IT 10% ARE GETTING IDEAS IS THAT 90% WHAT WILL COUNT NUMBER DO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE IT TWO HUNDRED FORTY PEOPLE THEY CRUNCHING NUMBERS? PRIOR TO MOVING THEM ASSUME YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME SOME GREAT DATA SO. SO SO WHAT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT PERCENTAGE IT DEPENDS ON THE OFFICE TO PAY AN HONOR EVERY OFFICES YOU NEED LAST STATEWIDE YEAH THAT'S IT SO STATEWIDE. AND I I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE THE EXACT VOLUME YOU WANNA KNOW HOW MUCH IS A VEHICLE REGISTRATION HOW MUCH TO DRIVE SO SO. ALRIGHT SO STATE WHY ON ANNUAL BASIS HOW ME DRIVERS LICENSES THAT WE PROCESS NO I I ASKED YOU TO BE STAYS BETWEEN OFFICE RIGHT NOW TODAY. IF SOMEONE WALKS INTO THE AVERAGE DAY IN THE OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE THERE TESTIMONY RECENTLY AND THEN ONLINE AND CONSTITUENTS CALLING AND STOPPING ME ON THE STREET AS SENATOR ROTH MENTION -- OF MULTIPLE MULTIPLE OUR SOMETIMES AS LONG AS EIGHT HOURS OF PEOPLE PASSING OUT IN THE IN THE OPPOSITE SENATOR. WHAT NUMBER DO YOU KNOW -- OF BUT EVEN IF IT'S SOMEONE ANECDOTAL WHICH I MEAN I'M SURPRISED AT THE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE DATA. THAT PEOPLE ARE WALKING INTO AN OFFICE HALF FOR GOING THIS WAY TO GET NEW REAL ID AND HALF FOR GOING THIS WAY TO DO ROUTINE DMB SERVICE SUCH AS RE REGISTER IN A CAR WHAT'S WHAT'S ANOTHER TODAY RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE SEEING ABOUT 1019% OF THE CUSTOMERS. AGAIN A REAL LIKE THE WE HAVE NO NUMBERS ON THAT SEA OF NUMBERS THAT 20% AND WHAT WAS IT BEFORE TAKE PEOPLE GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE PRIOR TO THIS. BUT SO PRIOR TO THIS NUMBER SO SO IN 19% IS CAUSING YOUR YOUR YOUR CLAIM WAS YESTERDAY. 19% WAS CAUSING [inaudible] YOU KNOW. NOMINEE YOU SIX HOURS PRO IS AN AVERAGE SIX HOUR DELAY IT THE DMB. WHAT WAS IT PRIOR TO THE 19%? SO THE OFFICE PROFILE SO I IT COULD BE WELL. I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU EXACT NUMBERS BUT FOR AN OFFICE JANE ON SOME WE DON'T DO KNOW THAT SOME OFFICERS ARE MORE HEAVY IN SHERMAN DRIVERS LICENSES. AND THAT COULD BE A SIXTY FORTY SPLIT BUT STATE WHY IT COULD BE SIXTY FOUR I I WOULD SAY. THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S MOVED UP TO SIXTY FORTY IN TERMS OF DRIVERS LICENSES AND IN VEHICLE REGISTRATION BECAUSE THE SHIP HAS BEEN CROWNED RELY TEACHER. SO A I AND I HAVE ONE ONE LAST POINT IT WITH ADULTS THE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME TROUBLING REPORTS THAT THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION OR COMPANY CALLED YOU GOV. THAT'S BEEN SNAPPING UP APPOINTMENTS -- SUCKING THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM -- AND SELLING THEM TO PEOPLE AND SO ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO RE PURCHASE THESE STE TIME SLOTS ARE ABLE TO DO THAT -- SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME FLAWS THERE I'M I I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THIS AND I'M SURE THE CONSTITUENCIES AND AND THE MEDIA ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE SURPRISED IF THEY DON'T ALREADY KNOW THIS -- WHAT IS THE DMV DOWN TO CLOSE THIS THIS EGREGIOUS LOOPHOLE THAT IS CAUSING OUR CONSTITUENTS AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET THEIR APPOINTMENTS OUT THAT THEY DESERVE? ONLINE SO WE EVOLVE. INTO THAT COMPANY YOGA A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE NOT SCREEN SCRAPING IT OFF OUR PLATE WITH SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY GRABBING THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND THEN RESELLING THEM. SO WE DID SOME FOR EXCELLENT FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF THAT TO IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE JUST GRABBED THE POINT WASN'T AVAILABLE FREE TO CUSTOMERS. AND SO THEY HAVE AND THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT WE AND HAD A DELIBERATE DIFFICULTY CONTACTED ORDER TO INTERVIEW THAT THE OWNER HE WOULD NOT SHOW UP -- FOR AND MAKE CONTACT WITH US AND WE WE DID FIND THAT AND WE ALSO WANT TO GO IN AND REVIEW IS OPERATIONS TO SEE HOW HE'S DOING THAT TO FIND OUT. AND DONE HE HAS NOT -- FALL THAT WITH THIS ALLOWS INTO TO SEE ITS OPERATIONS -- I I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT WOULD LIKE TO FOR THAT YOU STOP ALL SCRAPING OF ANY THIRD PARTY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS WE DID THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED US MAIL DOT COM THAT WAS DOING THAT THEY'RE DOING IT SO YOU HAVE STOPPED. WE HAVE STOPPED OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE EMBRACING OKAY OKAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE REASON I CAME TO SACRAMENTO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TAXPAYERS AND THEIR DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY AND THAT'S WHY I'VE. I'VE I'VE MOVED THE AUDIT I THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY I'M. FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT AND TO PUT SOME OF THE STUFF OUT IN DAYLIGHT APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE AND WHAT'S CHALLENGING -- THE IN A WORK ON A WORKING IN GOVERNMENT AND LIMITED RESOURCES BUT WE HAVE APPROPRIATED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY YOU ASK FOR MORE MONEY THAT WE'VE BEEN APPROPRIATED. OUT FOR THESE PURPOSES -- AND I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE THAT TAXPAYERS MONIES ARE BEING WHITE WISELY SPENT IN THAT THEIR VALUABLE TIME THEY'RE NOT TAKING VACATION TIME AND TIME JUST TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. IT SHOULD BE A ROUTINE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU MISTER. MR ACOSTA -- NEXT IS MS RUBIO BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I WANTED TO SAY I HAVE ON MY LIST SENATOR LARA. MS BAKER SENATOR ALLEN SAID. AND IT IS ALSO TEN FORTY WE HAVE -- SECOND ITEM WE HAVE SIX MORE ITEMS TO GO. WITH THAT MISS RUBIO. THANK YOU I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TECHNICALITIES AND MONEY AND ALL THAT FOR ME. GIVES ME -- THIS IS A CULTURAL -- I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN -- I DID A CULTURAL. I SEE IT IS A LET ME BACK UP WE'VE OFTEN JOKED ó IT'S THE DMT -- WE'VE BEEN CONDITIONED OVER THE YEARS TO ACCEPT THAT THE DMV IS. LYING THE FOR THE HOURS BUT I THINK ALSO THE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN CONDITION THAT IT'S OKAY. TO JUST KIND OF GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRANSACTION AND GO GET COFFEE IT'S HAPPENED TO ME. AND SO IS THERE A TRAINING. OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT IT IS A CULTURE IT'S A DMB CULTURE I JUST WAS JOKING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. ABOUT THE DMV AND THE WHEN THIS CAME UP I WENT OH I'M PART OF THAT CULTURE AS WELL. ARE WE GONNA HAVE ANY KIND OF TRAINING OR ANY KIND OF I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. A OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE DAY THERE'S MANY THAT DON'T. YOU NO SLACK OFF AND AND JUST GO GET COFFEE WHEN PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEM HOWEVER THE OVERALL CLERK CULTURE AT LEAST IN MY PERCEPTION IS THAT. WHAT'S JUST THE DMV AND PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO ACCEPT THAT SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF PEOPLE KIND OF TRAINING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT CULTURE IS IS IS GONE -- THE OTHER THING IS I KNOW THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF OF PROCESSING THESE THINGS QUICKLY I JUST GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE. ACTUALLY TWO WEEKS AGO AND I DID AN ONLINE AND WITHIN THE WEEK I HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE WHICH I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED SO IF YOU HAVE THAT. ABILITY ONLINE WHY DON'T WE HAVE THE ABILITY WHEN FOLKS ARE -- THERE IN PERSON AND SO THE ONE REQUEST I GUESS WOULD BE IS WHAT CAN CAN YOU LOOK AND INTO KIND OF THE CULTURE MAY BE THE THE AYE AYE THAT SOME OF THE OUR SURVEY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES AS FAR AS A CULTURE I THINK THE GENTLEMAN THAT TESTIFIED. EARLIER SAID THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL IT'S NOT JUST THE SYSTEMS OR THE OUTDATED EQUIPMENT IT'S THE CULTURE OF THE DMV. AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT AS WELL BECAUSE WE CAN INVEST ALL THE MONEY WE CAN. INTO THE DMB BUT IF THE CULTURE THE THEY WERE JUST GOING TO BE WAITING IN LINE AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S JUST KIND OF IT'S ACCEPTED THAT IT'S THE DMT. I GUESS IN SO WE WE ALREADY HAVE STARTED A CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING WE HAVE VOTE OUT DIFFERENT OF FOUR CATEGORIES. OF ITS UP FOR RESOLVE INITIATIVE AND AND WELCOME IN SO WE CAN RESOLVE THE PROBLEM SO WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED THAT TRAINING -- THERE MAY BE SOME EMPLOYEES ACT OUT WE HAVE TO DO REFRESHER TRAINING GO BACK WE DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY MORNING WE DO WEDNESDAY MORNING TRAINING. WILL TAKE THAT BACK AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND. OF WHAT THE CULTURE IS IS TO SERVE THE CUSTOMERS WITH WITH THE RESPECT AND THAT WE WILL GO BACK AND WE WILL DO MORE REFRESHER TRAINING AND CONTINUE -- TO BUT WORK ON THAT THAT I I DO AGREE THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED BECAUSE MR RESTRAINT REGARDING THAT BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TRACK THAT AFTER THE TRAINING IS DONE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY. ME BECAUSE TRUST ME WE'VE ALL BEEN TO TRAININGS AND WE ARE THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE AND SO HOW DO YOU FOLLOW UP AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THE THE THE TRAINING THAT YOU GAVE THEM HAS WORKED. SO THIS IS WHERE WE WILL WORK WITH OFFICE MANAGERS IN THE OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAINING IS CONDUCTED. WILL DO SOME SPOT WE WILL DO WHAT WE MAY CALL SECRET SHOPPER TRAINEE OUT DOES VISITS TO MAKE SURE AND SEE. THAT HOUSE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WE WHEN I GO AND VISIT THE OFFICES I DON'T ANNOUNCE ON COMEY WE KINDA HANG I CAN HANG BACKING UP WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE OFFICE IN OBSERVE. AND I WHEN WE I DO HERE AND WE DO HEAR CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS THAT WE DO GET WE DO GET THOSE WE ADDRESS THOSE IMMEDIATELY WE REACH OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND THEN WE REACH OUT. AND TALK TO THE OFFICE MANAGER THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AT SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHESS SENATOR LAURA STEPPED OUT AND SO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST I HAVE. BOTH QUESTIONS FOR AGENCY DIRECTOR AS WELL AS THE AUDITOR. AND ALSO A SECOND THE AUDIT MOTION I PROCEED -- THIS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO'S. POINT ABOUT CULTURE. AND WHAT TRAINING ARE YOU DOING I THINK THERE'S AN UNDERLYING CURRENT HERE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE AUDIT COVERS IT. AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR WHEN THERE IS A PERFORMANCE. AND I HEAR A LOT OF TERMS THAT SOUND GOOD WHICH IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- RESOLVE TRAINING THAT RESOLVE THIS IS VERY GOOD BUT THEN. VERY RECENTLY LAST MONTH WE GOT AN AUDIT. ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE SLEEPING ON THE JOB FOR YEARS. AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY. SO ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD FOR THE CULTURE MAY BE HELPFUL BUT IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY. IT MEANS NOTHING AND THAT'S THE CASE FOR ANY INSTITUTION SO. I AS WAS TO MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO HAVE THE REPORT IN FRONT OF ME AND MY GOOD COLLEAGUE HAS MADE A VERY GOOD POINT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE AUDITED HERE I DON'T GETS COVERED BY THE AUDIT BUT IT IS. THE CULTURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- TO THAT POINT I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO FULL OF MISTER ROSS QUESTION WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ANSWERED HE ANSWERED YOU HAVE. A VERY DIRECT QUESTION. AND THAT WAS WHAT IS THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME. FROM WHEN SOMEBODY GETS THE NOTIFICATION IN THE MAIL AND I BY THE WAY. THE DAVEY NEVER SENT ME MINE BUT THAT GOES TO THE AIR QUESTION WHEN YOU NEED TO RENEW YOUR LICENSE WHEN YOU GET A NOTIFICATION THE MAIL. AND WHEN YOU CAN GET AN APPOINTMENT. HE ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY AND THE ANSWER YOU GAVE WAS WERE WORKING ON THIS WE HAVE THAT NEED TO DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IT DOESN'T MATCH UP. SO WE HAVE APARTMENTS AVAILABLE NINETY DAYS OUT. AND WE'RE WE MAIL OUT TO RENO KNOWS IS -- IT TODAY IT DOESN'T MATCH UP WE GET SIXTY DAYS IN ADVANCE APPOINTMENTS ARE AVAILABLE NINETIES AND IF THAT'S I CANNOT IT DOESN'T MATCH UP. HOW WE NEED TO MAKE MORE APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE TO MATCH UP WITH WHEN YOU GET TO NOTICE AND -- THOSE WILL START GOING OUT INTO THE MONTH I KNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT I THINK I'M HEARING IS YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME AS WELL AND I UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T MATCH UP. THAT'S WHY OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE IN LINE WHEN THEY CAN'T GET AN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE ONLY APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE ARE AFTER THE EXPIRATION. THAT TO ME UNDERSCORES ANOTHER REASON WHY WE DESPERATELY NEED THIS AUDIT AND I HOPE IT WILL GET. LAST SUPPORT FOR THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE IF IF IT THE DIRECTOR LEVEL WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO THOSE TYPE OF QUESTIONS. WE NEED THE ON SO YOU'RE TALK IT SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY -- THE PLATE WITH BILLY ABILITY BY OFFICE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT SO'S YOUR ST ACT OUT WE DID LOOK AT THE WEBSITE. AND TERMS THAT WE DO WE DO LOOK AT THE POINT AVAILABILITY -- IT IS -- SOME OFFICES YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET WIND OF THE COUPLE WEEKS SOME IT MAY IT IS OUT TO EIGHT WEEKS AND SOMEONE IS OUT TO NINE TO TWELVE WEEKS IT DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH BEING WHETHER WE NOTICES GO OUT. TO BE ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT THAT CARRIES. SO I RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET A POINT WITHIN TEN DAYS AND SO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES IMPOSSIBLE IT IS. THE IT KIT AND SOMEONE PENCILS YOU CAN WRITE HE'LL GET AN APPOINTMENT SO WE WE NEED TO WORK. AND A STRATEGY TO MAKE MORE APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE TO TO MATCH UP AND I YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT THE WEBSITE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT TODAY RIGHT NOW AND APPOINTMENTS WHEAT I DID LOOK AT IT -- THEY'RE GOING OUT INTO SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DEPENDING ON THE OFFICE CONSOLE DEPARTMENT BILL OF THE AND RIGHT NOW IS NOT MEETING OUR DEMAND. THANK YOU -- IN NOW YOU WERE VERY KIND YESTERDAY TO TO ACCEPT -- AND I I GAVE YOU IT AT THE TIME I GET A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IT'S A SAMPLE OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE CONTACTED ME. AND JUST SAID I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH EXPERIENCES CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR AND IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH. TO TO BE HOURS TO GO THROUGH THIS MANY THANK YOU AYE MAGIC TAKE THAT LAST NIGHT ON THE EVE OF THE HEARING SO I APPRECIATE THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THROUGH. WHAT WERE YOUR TAKEAWAYS WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT? DON'T YOU FEEL MAY BE THE AUDIT CAN HELP YOU ADDRESS AS PROBLEMS OR NOT. SO I READ THROUGH ALL OF THESE LAST NIGHT AND DEFTLY WE DEEM NEED TO WORK ON OFFICES IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE MANAGER BEING RESPONSIVE FOR THE OFFICE A LOT OF WHAT WE DID. AND THERE WASN'T NOT PROPER SIGNAGE THAT WAS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO GO TO THE RIGHT LINE STAND THE PLACEMENT NOT EQUIPMENT LINE. AND TRIAGE WAS NOT BEING DONE PROPERLY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THEN PUT ON IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS -- THEY NEED TO RETURN AYE WE DO WE THAT PROBABLY WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT. COMMENTS WERE MADE WHERE WE HAVE TO EXPEDITE WINDOW TODAY IT WE DID REMOVE THE HEART STOP ON GETTING TAKING HER NAUSEOUS AT FOUR THIRTY WE ALSO AND PRIVACY. NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR ONLINE UGLY TO ALL APPLICATION THAT WAS ONE COMMENT THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JULY SIXTEENTH -- WE ARE PUT IMPLEMENTED TEXT MESSAGING OF IF YOU ARE IN THE OFFICE AND YOU HAVE YOUR Q. TICKET EYES TERRIFIC AT THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO REALLY WORK WITH EACH OFFICE EACH OFFICE IS DIFFERENT. AND WE WILL WORK WITH EACH OFFICE ADDRESS OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE TO DO AN OVERALL LOOK AT EVERY OFFICE TO ENSURE THEY'RE DOING THE BEST PRACTICES THEY'RE SERVING THE CUSTOMERS -- WITH SOME OF THESE WORDS THE CUSTOMERS -- DID NOT WE SEE WHAT THEY ASK FOR OF THOSE EARLY BEING BILLS BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE I'VE BEEN CONTACTED THIS MORNING ARI PASSED THAT OUT IN Q. OUR LOOKING AT THAT ONE CUSTOMER REQUESTED A REFUND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT AND GET WHEN THEY GOT PAID BOTH ONLINE. AND BY CHECKING THE DAY OF THE TO THE NINETY BOTH PARENTS GOT IT WILL GET THAT CUSTOMER REFUND SO -- WHEN I GET BACK TO THE OFFICE I WILL HAVE INFORMATION BACK AND HOW WE RESPONDED TO EACH OF THESE CUSTOMERS THAT THAT THAT SENT YOU INFORMATION VERY VERY GREAT LOOK AT ALL OF THESE? AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR COLLEAGUES THERE ACTUALLY. SEVEN HOURS SOMETIMES THREE HOURS TO GET NUMBER THAN ONE HOUR TO GET INTO THE ROOM AND OTHERWISE THEY THEY HAD A POT [inaudible] PARENTS -- IN I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKED AT THAT WHAT WHAT I TOOK AWAY. AND AGAIN I THINK IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR THIS AUDIT IS THAT THE THE STATEMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON WAIT TIMES BEAR NO. RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE EXPERIENCING AND REALITY I'VE USED I'M SURE YOU READ THAT COMMENTARY ABOUT HOW I'M STANDING IN LINE FOR THE FIFTH OUR AND I LOOK ON THE WEBSITE IT SAYS THE WAIT TIME IN THIS PLACE IS FORTY FIVE MINUTES. AND THAT THAT WHERE YOU ARE DEPLOYING RESOURCES. ADDITIONAL STAFF IS BASED ON WAIT TIMES I'M VERY GLAD THAT THE AUTHORS WROTE THIS SO THAT WHEN THE WEIGHT AND WHAT THE WAIT TIME MEASURES BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA TELL US WHERE WHERE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THEM. SO APPRECIATE THAT QUICK QUESTIONS FOR THE AUDITOR -- THERE IS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECENTLY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS -- TEXTING TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR NUMBER IS SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU GO TO THE GENIUS BAR APPLE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A WHILE YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND THERE. YOU CAN GO GET FOOD HAVE LOCKER AND EVEN MAYBE WAIT YOUR CAR RIVER IT IS -- WILL THIS AUDIT IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE READING A GIVE YOU SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO SEE HOW THE VERY RECENT TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THAT. LITERALLY JUST COME OUT SINCE THE AUDIT WITH AUTHORED HAVE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE BEING. A AND AND DOES IT GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT YES THERE'S A AN OBJECTIVE THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT STEPS DMB HAS TAKEN TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES -- AND ALSO ASKING US TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT REALLY HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON WAIT TIMES HELP YOU. VERY MEDI ANSWERED YES IT AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS IMPORTANT AND THAT WE ARE A LITTLE BIT OF ALLUSION TO IT IS AND THE COMMENT YOU HEARD US FOLKS BE WAITING IN LINE. AND SOMEONE JUST CLOSES THE WINDOW AND SOMETIME AROUND NOON EVERYBODY STOPS EVERYTHING STOPS THE WIND STOPS. EIGHT YOUR HARD WORKERS HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK -- THEY HAVE BREAKS READ THE DATES HEALTHY IT'S GOOD BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF THE AUDIT A GIVES YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO LOOK AT HOW STAFF FOR BEING USED ON THE FLOOR. IN THOSE OFFICES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT TO HE OR OTHERWISE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY IS IT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS OR WHEN FIVE O'CLOCK COMES AROUND THAT HAVE HAVE FIRST HALF HOUR BEFORE THE CLOSE SUDDENLY EVERYTHING SPEEDS UP AND WERE ABLE TO GET FOLKS OUT THE DOOR FOR HER TESTIMONY. DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT ABILITY TO DO YOU NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THAT. NO I DON'T THINK WE NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY WANT TO LOOK FOR AND AMEND IT AND THAT WOULD BE WOVEN THROUGH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES MS BAKER BECAUSE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THEIR PLANTS. AND THAT WOULD BE RELATED TO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE YOUR VARIOUS OFFICES HOW DID YOU DETERMINE WHICH OFFICES FOR SATURDAY HOURS HOW YOU DETERMINING HOURS DURING THE DAY HOW MANY STAFF ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE FOR A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS THAT SO YES THAT WOULD BE. WOVEN THROUGHOUT MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES THANK YOU IT AND AT THE END IN ADDITION GOES TO THE ISSUE I WANNA MAKE SURE THE AYE COVERS THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT [inaudible] WHOM THAT. SOMETIMES FOLKS WAIT AS THEIR MANY COMMENTERS HERMAN IS IT SOMETIMES A WAIT FOR HOURS FOR IT LIKE SIX MINUTES OF SERVICE. SO WE TOOK A SCREENSHOT SAID IT TOOK ME SEVEN MINUTES ONCE I GOT UP THERE TO GET TAKE CARE OF I HAD TO WAIT SEVEN HOURS. IN OTHER INSTANCES -- SOMEONE WAITS FOR SEVEN HOURS AND HAVE A VERY LONG PROCESS BUT THAT'S LESS WAIT TIME THAT'S MORE WHAT SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO YOU THAT PERHAPS COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED A DIFFERENT WAY. AND AND THAT IS UP MORE THAT CAN BE DONE ONLINE AND DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO COME TO THE DMV AND EVEN MORE THAT CAN BE. ALLOWED IN THE WORLD OF OF THE MOTOR CLUBS AND OTHERWISE I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE TO THINK SHOULD HAVE TO BECOME A MOTOR CLUB MEMBER IN ORDER TO GET SOME OF THESE OTHER APPOINTMENTS WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT A SEPARATE HEARING. BUT WHAT DOES THE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT WHAT CAN BE CHANGED AND EVEN MOVED OUTSIDE OF THE DMV OFFICE WHETHER IT'S MORE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. OR WHAT MIGHT BE A GOOD. CANDIDATE FOR ALLOWING AT A PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH SIMILAR TO HOW THE POST OFFICE WHICH ALSO SERVES A VERY CRITICAL FUNCTION [inaudible] HAS A POSTAL ANNEXES THERE OFTEN SMALL FAMILY BUSINESSES WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO GO THE POST OFFICE OF I WANT TO SHIP A PACKAGE YOU DO THINGS. DOES THE I GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AGAIN I THINK THAT WOULD BE WOVEN THROUGH VARIETY OF OBJECTIVES BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST LOOKING AT WHAT IS D. M. V. DOING. TO ANTICIPATE REAL ID BUT ALSO MANAGE ITS OVERALL FUNCTIONS IT WHETHER IT'S REGISTRATION AND AND INCLUDED IN THOSE PLANS DID THEY DETERMINE OKAY THESE ARE THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS THAT WE CAN SHIFT AS YOU SUGGEST THAT TO AN ANNEX OR WE COULD MAKE THAT AN ONLINE FUNCTION. PARTICULARLY SINCE REAL ID THE REQUIREMENT IS YOU HAVE TO COME INTO A DMV OFFICE SO WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOLKS COMING IN THE DMP. ARE THERE OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT WE COULD CONVERT TO JUST AN ONLINE SITUATION OR HAVE THE SATELLITE. ANNEXES OR WHATEVER TO SO OKAY THE A SHORT ANSWER IS I THINK IT WOULD BE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE WOULD WE THAT IN A VARIETY OF OBJECTIVES AND I HOMES OUT THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU'D BE VERY VALUABLE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE WEEDS. ON ON HOW THEY'RE OPERATING PARTICULAR WITH WILL WHAT ARE GOOD CANDIDATES. TO TO ALLOW FOR PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS -- NOT LIMITED TO MOTOR CLUBS BUT EVEN BEYOND BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE VERY CRITICAL TRANSACTIONS LIKE POSTAL SERVICE WORK THAT NOW IS IS PROVIDED IN OTHER WAYS -- I ALSO WERE AND I'M I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE GET IT RIGHT AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS EVERY ELECTION CYCLE THEY HAVE TO RAMP UP WITH A LOT OF TEMPORARY WORKERS TO PROCESS BILL BY MAIL BALLOTS. AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A PRACTICE THE DMV HAS HAD IN THE PAST [inaudible] BUT I HOPE THAT THIS WILL ALSO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHAT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN. UTILIZED TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS -- MOST BUSINESSES HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT WHEN THEY HAVE AND IF THEY DON'T GO TO BUSINESS -- BUT IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY DO THAT -- I I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS AUDIT INCLUDE THE ABILITY. TO HOW WELL AND IF THE DMV IS APPROPRIATELY RAMPING UP AND THEN. CAME BACK WHAT WHAT I DON'T SEE HAPPEN IS A BUDGET THAT WE GIVE YOU FOR ONE THING YOU END UP SPENDING ON SOMETHING ELSE SO. THAT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCKING POINT HERE -- WILL YOU ALSO SPEAK I OR HER ALIVE DISCUSSION AT SPEAKING TO MANAGEMENT. YESTERDAY AND THE HEARING ONE CRITICAL PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAD AND THEN PER INDIVIDUAL HAD TO WAIT FOR A COUPLE HOURS IN THE IRONY WAS NOT LOST ON ANY OF US TO COMMENT ON THIS WAS. A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE DMV AND WHO SAID PLEASE SPEAK TO THE EMPLOYEES DON'T JUST VISIT WITH MANAGEMENT. AT THESE LOCATIONS EITHER IN SACRAMENTO ARE GOING TO THE OFFICES AND YOU MENTIONED YOU WOULD BE TALKING TO SUPERVISORS. CAN YOU PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE IN YOUR WORK. TALKING TO EMPLOYEES LONGTIME SHORT TIME WHISTLEBLOWERS NON WHISTLEBLOWERS AND WE THINK IT IS I JUST DIDN'T HEAR THAT WORD AND AND THAT IN THE PROCESS THAT WAS GOING. GOING TO HAPPEN AND FINALLY -- THE ABILITY. TO DETERMINE WHAT ELSE OTHER THAN REAL ID IS THE CAUSE OF PROBLEMS AT THE DMV A LOT OF WHAT WE WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF IT MENTIONED AIR IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE DMV CAUSING. THE HARM. BUT THERE'S LEVEL OF SERVICE. THAT IS NOT THE WAIT TIMES IS NOT THE ONLY ISSUE OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH IT'S THE LEVEL OF SERVICE. AT THE DMV I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE YOU WOULD NEED EITHER GUIDANCE ON OR? BE ABLE TO COVER WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE TO SOME US GOES TO AGAIN. BRING A BACKGROUND FULL CIRCLE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO IS GOOD POINT ABOUT CULTURE. WELL I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL. WITH RESPECT TO CULTURE AND AND YOUR QUESTION ABOUT RAMPING UP AND WE WE DO HAVE AN OBJECTIVE THE MEMBERS ASKED US TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW. THE STATUS OF HIRING AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS AS I WAS SITTING LISTENING TO THEIR TO DISCUSSIONS AS WAS THERE A PLAN TO HIRE LIMITED TERM BECAUSE REAL ID IS GOING TO BE JUST THIS INFLUX EVERY SINGLE. LICENSE HOLDER IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO GET A REAL ID AND THEY HAVE TO GOING TO A DMV OFFICE. THERE'S GONNA BE A FLOOD OF INDIVIDUALS WAS THEIR ANTICIPATION AND THEY'RE PLANNING [inaudible] TO HIRE. PEOPLE ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS -- VERY SMALL EXAMPLE OF THAT IS UP TO US WITH REDISTRICTING WE KNEW WE WOULD BE. SLAMMED WITH A LOT OF WORK A FEW YEARS AGO WE HIRED SOME LIMITED TERM FOLKS IN THAT AND THEY KNEW I'M GONNA BE WORKING FOR THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE FOR A YEAR AND THEN I'M DONE. SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD BE LOOKING -- FOR THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE THAT ASKS US TO LOOK AT THINGS BEYOND REAL ID. ARE AS FAR AS DETERMINING WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT REALLY AFFECTED DMV'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHETHER OR NOT DMV HAS ADEQUATE PLANS TO ADDRESS THOUGH SO I THINK THAT MIGHT TOUCH ON WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF HAVE AND THEN THE LAST IS ABOUT LOOKING AT TRAINING -- AND HEARING THAT THEY HAVE TRAINED WE MIGHT WANT OBSERVE THE TRAINING WE MIGHT WANT TO SEE OKAY WHAT IS D. M. V. DITCH DOING TO DETERMINE WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING ALL OF THIS TRAINING HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVED SERVICE -- AND WHAT KINDS OF THINGS OR ARE THEY DOING TO DETERMINE THAT AND DO THEY NEED MAKE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE TRAINING OR DO THEY NEED -- TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MANAGERS TO MAKE SURE MANAGERS ARE. ARE MAKING IT CLEAR TO STAFF WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE SO AGAIN IT'S KIND OF A SIMILAR ANSWER TO YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS. THERE ARE VARIETY OF JEFF CAN INJECTED HERE THAT HAVE A LOT OF THAT WOVEN IN OF THE MEMBERS ASKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND WE'RE TRYING TO WEAVE THAT INTO EACH OBJECTIVE AYE I THINK YOU FOR THAT I REALLY THINK THE AUTHORS. FOR FOR TRYING TO HAVING A FOCUSED ON IT BUT ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO GIVE THE AUDITOR THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT. AND IN PARTICULAR IN THIS LAST WHAT CONSEQUENCES COME WITH FAILURE TO DO IT BECAUSE IF THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANOTHER REPORT FROM YOU PERHAPS ABOUT SO MANY SLEPT ON THE JOB FOR FOUR YEARS. MEANWHILE WE'VE GOT CONSTITUENTS PASSING OUT ONLINE AYE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO GET IN ORDER TO FUNCTION -- I ALSO I THINK THE DIRECTOR FOR COMING FOR TWO DAYS OF TESTIMONY FOR PERSONALLY LOOKING AT THOSE RESPONSES IF I CAN BE OF SERVICE AND CLOSING THE LOOP WITH ANY OF THOSE CONSTITUENTS ON IT -- AND A REALLY HOPE THE THAT YOU'RE GONNA I'M SURE YOU WILL BE IN FULL COOPERATION WITH THE AUDITOR ALL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS -- BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL THANK YOU FOR INDULGING MY COLLEAGUES IN THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IT IS ELEVEN A. M. WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO HOURS THIS IS OUR SECOND ITEM. SEVERAL LARA. THANK YOU I'LL BE BRIEF I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS BUT I I ALSO WANNA. ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S IT'S EASY TO BEAT UP ON THE DMV -- AND IT'S AN EASY GO -- TO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S IN VOGUE AYE IN OUR COUNTRY NOW THIS NOWADAYS TO ATTACK GOVERNMENT AND TRY TO DISCREDIT IT. BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD AND ACKNOWLEDGING OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATORS -- IN TERMS OF LACK OF FUN. TO THE DMV -- AND CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S THERE'S CONCERNS OF MY QUESTION IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE WERE WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS -- THIS ONGOING NEED TO INCREASE SERVICES AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FIELD OFFICES. AND THERE WAS A STRATEGY AS AS A SUMMER BAKER SAID AND ALLUDED TO IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE. TO USE THE ONLINE SERVICES AND GET THEM. NOT TO NECESSARILY HAVE TO GO INTO THE D. M. V.. AND I WANNA AND MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION I WANTED A TERRIFYING FOR ME DIRECTOR. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THAT STRATEGY HAS AS WE HAVE WE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES ONLINE? I UNDERSTAND THE REAL ID ACT IS AN ISSUE BUT HAVE. WHERE ARE WE ON THAT STRATEGY SO SO WE HAVE A PLAN WE ARE WORKING TO ADD ANOTHER TRANSACTION TO OUR CELLS ARE? US SELF SERVICE TERMINALS WHERE THIS IS WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO A SEE A TECHNICIAN YOU ARE -- CAN GO TO I SAW CERTAIN WHICH ARE IN OUR FIELD OFFICES IN RETAIL LOCATIONS AND SO THAT IS FOR IF YOU HAVE VEHICLE REGISTRATION YOUR INSURANCE LAPSE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BE REINSTATED. IT'S A FOURTEEN DOLLAR REINSTATEMENT FEE WE ARE -- BY THE FALL WE WILL HAVE THAT IN PLACE SO THAT IS WHERE YOU TAKE. THE CUSTOMER OF OUT IN THE FIELD OFFICE IN USING ALTERNATIVE SERVICES THAT WE DO HAVE A PLAN TO ADD MORE TRANSACTIONS. BUT AS THE LEGISLATURE PASSES TO IMPLEMENT THOSE FIRST IN SO THERE'S BEEN MANY. OF THE STATUE SENATE IN PASSING WEEK IMPLEMENTED THOSE AND SO WE HAVE TO DO WE WE HAVE TO HAVE IT FOLKS WORKING ON DO YOU HAVE BEEN A HOW MANY BILLS WE'VE PASSED THAT AFFECT THE DMV AND D'AMATO FOR CLOUD THAT THAT TAKES. AND I I DIDN'T BRING THAT WITH ME I DID HAVE MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR IDENTIFY AND THAT WE'VE DONE -- MANY AND AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A SOME THAT WERE WORKING THERE HAVE TO OF MID JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY NINE TWO OF THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'LL BE DONE THE FOR CONNIE PILOT FOR IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE YOU HAVE TO HAVE STATEWIDE. IMPLEMENTATION JANUARY FIRST THE AND GENDER IDENTITY AND SO WE HAVE TO DO THAT -- JENNIFER'S -- TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE DONE -- AND AMNESTY AND FOR THE SUSPENSION ON NOT FORGET YOU CAN STILL BE ABLE TO DRIVE THAT WE'VE DONE SOME AMNESTY ON THAT AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO. TO BE ABLE TO STILL -- SERVE THE CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA STRAIGHT [inaudible] BECAUSE OF ASSN STATUE WE HAVE HARD IMPLEMENTATION DATES ARE RESOURCES AND I T. ARE DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE THAT. WE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT AND IMPLEMENT THOSE LEGISLATION AND SO IN TERMS OF GETTING THE OTHER ONLINE ACTIVITIES WE HAVE TO DO A COMMIT FIRST OF THE LEGISLATURE. IF YOU CAN GIVE WILL GIVE US LIKE THAT'S WHAT SUMMARY OF OF THAT TO THE COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE LIFE THAT I HAD GOTTEN A HUMBLING WERE REQUIRING. YOU TO DO ON ANNUAL BASIS AS BILLS GET PAST MY THE QUESTION I THINK IT IS FOR BOTH THE DIRECTOR AND THE AUDITOR. YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED WITH OUR AB SIXTY DRIVERS AND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL THIS AUDIT IN TERMS OF HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT. THE DATA OF THE THESE VULNERABLE TO OUR DRIVERS ALREADY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CONCERN WITH -- MEAN ON ANY POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO OUR IMMIGRANT DRIVERS FISH UNDER THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. IS THIS WHAT THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT IMPACT -- ANY DATA OR ANY INFORMATION AND IN REGARDS TO OUR AB SIXTY DRIVERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT AB SIGH AFTER. ITS ARE UNDOCUMENTED DRIVE OKAY -- I I DON'T IMAGINE ANY OF THE OBJECTIVES BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SENATOR WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THOSE DRIVERS. I'M NOT SURE. MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT EXTRA HELP AS WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THING WHERE WE'RE PROTECTING THE DATA ADAM AS WERE COLLECTING AND LOW ABSOLUTE FOR INTO WELL IT AND ANY TIME MY OFFICE CONDUCTS AN AUDIT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ELECTRONIC DATA AND WE'VE ALREADY TALKED Y. T.. STAFF ABOUT THIS PROJECT WE THINK WE WOULD USE OUR IT AUDITOR'S WE HAVE -- INFORMATION -- SECURITY OFFICER HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A DATA SECURITY PLAN. WORK WITH LEGAL MAKE SURE THAT WERE FOLLOWING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO PROTECT ANY INFORMATION THAT WE OBTAIN FROM A DEPARTMENT. SO WE WOULD HAVE VERY TIGHT CONTROLS IN PLACE WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA THAT WE GET FROM THE ENVY IF YOU CAN JUST RESPOND TO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN YOU KNOW THE POPULATION. THAT WORD TOWARD TALKING ABOUT YES SO OF WE MAKE SURE THAT. THE DOCUMENTS THAT SUBMITTED FROM THAT BY A DOCKET WAS SUBMITTED AND THAT WE HAVE WE SCANNED AND WE AND STORE THOSE THAT DATA AND SO WE ARE VERY MINDFUL OF PROTECTING THE INFORMATION OF A DOCTOR IMMIGRANTS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT IDENTIFIED ANYWAY. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE INFORMATION OF THEIR DOCUMENTS IS -- NOT SHARED WITH ANYBODY. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR AYE ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS AND AGAIN. I REMIND US THAT YOU KNOW THE DIEM BEEP DOES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE THERE ARE. A GREAT STAFF ARE TRYING TO DO THE MOST WITH WHAT WE HAVE THEM. I ASK THEM TO DO EVERY YEAR NOT ONLY TO POLICY BUT THROUGH MANDATES THAT WE HAVE SO I APPRECIATE WORK THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR ALAN. WELL THANK YOU. FOR THIS DISCUSSION I ALSO WAS ABLE TO NAY YESTERDAY -- TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET SUB IN AND YOU OF HIS FACE A LOT OF HARD QUESTIONS I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE IS SOUND. IS VERY -- I'M HAPPY. ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE REPORTS FROM HONDA IF THE FIELD IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT. DMV OFFICES ALL OVER THE STATE AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE QUESTION. I LIVE THAT LEAVES ME A LITTLE TORN ON THIS REQUEST IS -- YOU KNOW IF FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF WE WE KNEW THAT DOING THE AUDIT WOULD SUDDENLY RESOLVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS I WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTIVE. I GUESS -- MY QUESTION IS -- YET IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE KEY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. WE KNOW WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL STAFF ALONE IMPLEMENTING A TEXT NOTIFICATION OPTION PILOTING SELF CHECK IN KIOSKS EXPANDING. THE NEW SELF SERVICE TERMINALS ON THE SATURDAY SERVICE EXPANSION EARLY OFFICE HOURS -- ALL THE NEW HIRING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. I THERE'S A WHOLE SLEW OF PET PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT -- I THINK ARE ARE GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- I ALSO THINK THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE INCLUDE COORDINATION WITH YOU NEED TO VIEW LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE ARE THERE CERTAIN THINGS IT HOT THAT CURRENTLY HAPPEN AT THE DMV THAT HAVE TO HAVE A D. V. I JUST GOT MY PASSPORT RENEWED. BY MAIL -- SURLY THERE IS. THE SAME [inaudible] SECURITY AND AND YOU KNOW INTEGRITY AND AND FRIED. CHALLENGES A CONCERNS ASSOCIATE WITH THE PASSPORT IS THERE IS WITH THE DRIVER'S EYES I DON'T KNOW WHY TO DO THAT BY MAIL BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO GO IN PERSON. TO THE LICENSE I LOVED IT DESERVE REASON FOR THAT. SO FOR THE REAL IDEA IT'S A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT WEEK EVERY DVD HAS TO OUR CREDENTIAL PERSON IN PERSON IN PERSON SO WHAT ABOUT MY PASSPORT WHITE Y. IS THAT OKAY. DE DUM DE IN THAT BY MAIL SO AT THE FOR A RENEWAL ALL ONCE WE CREATE WE CREDENTIAL YOU FOR REAL ID OR IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE -- YOU CAN RENEW EVERY FIVE YEARS FOR AT THE FIRST TWO RENEWALS THAT IN PERSON VISIT RENO YOU COULD DEBT BY MAIL SO IT'S ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS AT WHICH HAVE TO COMMIT AND RENEW IN PERSON. AND SO WITH REAL ID IT IS BECAUSE FEDERAL OUT RELY DE TO DO AN IN PERSON VISIT BUT YOU REDUCE A ON A MAC THE CENTURY NOVEL UNNOTICED AND IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE YOU CAN RENEW BY MAIL YOU CAN RENEW ONLINE. WHERE YOU CAN GO TO A SELF SERVICE TERMINAL TO RENEW ONLINE IS THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE? TO WE HAVE TO RECRUIT RECRUIT ANSWER YOU IN PERSON. AND THEY DID NOT. I IMPOSE THAT REQUIREMENT ON PASSPORTS [inaudible] PASSPORTS A NO I THINK WE GET OUT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT MY PASSPORT I GOT MY PHOTO AND SEND THE PAPERWORK AGAIN. I I WILL NOT REAL FAMILIAR WITH HOW THEY VERIFY YOUR IDENTITY UP THROUGH THE PASSPORT SYSTEM BUT THESE ARE WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES AN IN PERSON VISIT. AND SO HOW THEY SET UP THE PROCESS FOR PASSPORTS IS DIFFERENT HOW THEY SET UP THE PROCESS FOR A FEDERAL ID YEAH. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT OUT WE WE HEARD FROM THE HOTTER EARLIER THAT. THEY'VE GOT FAR TOO MANY REQUESTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM OUR MEMBERS THAN THEY CAN HANDLE. ON A WHOLE SLEW OF DIFFERENT TOUGH ISSUES. AND I JUST WONDER ARE WE GONNA GET SO WE'RE GONNA PUT WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO SPEND YOUR BUDGET ON THIS AUDIT -- WHEN THAT BUDGET OUGHT TO BE GOING TO DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS [inaudible] YOU CERTAINLY [inaudible] I I I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT THEY DID YOU'VE HEARD THE HEAT FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM CONSTITUENTS. I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD INVESTMENT IF AS LONG AS THE LEGISLATURE IF WE WERE NOT TO DO THIS THIS AUDIT. THE LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE TO SET UP SOME SORT OF SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR REGULAR CHECKSTHAT WE BE READY TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE AUDIT IF WE FELT AS THOUGH. YOU WEREN'T BEING RESPONSIVE AND YOU WARRANT MEETING THESE ARE THESE -- COMMITMENTS THAT YOU MADE TO US PRETTY CLEARLY YESTERDAY AND TODAY. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M THAT'S WHY I'M TORN RIGHT NOW I'M I'M I'M -- I'M ALL FOR NOT IF I IT'S REALLY GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S GONNA TELL US WE ARE YOU KNOW. AND AND TAKE AWAY BOTH THE AUDITOR'S RESOURCES IN YOUR RESOURCES [inaudible] FROM -- FROM GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PROBLEM -- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY I'M YOU KNOW. SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF MY OPEN QUESTION RIGHT NOW. THAT I'M THAT I'M GRAPPLING WITH I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT IF THIS IS COMMITTEE DECIDES NOT TO DO AN AUDIT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD. A VERY -- STRONG COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE ON A REGULAR BASIS REPORT BACK ON YOUR PROGRESS. AND I WOULD ALSO I'D BE -- YOU KNOW. INTERESTED IN IN IN. GETTING TOUGH IF IF THERE WAS A I FEELING ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT YOU ARE MEETING THE COMMITMENTS YOU MAY CLEARLY TO US. BOTH YESTERDAY IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND TODAY. HERE IN THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. SO THAT'S MY THOUGHTS ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW AND I GUESS I'D LIKE THAT MAYBE I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE AUDITOR I MEAN YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE CONSTANTLY GETTING REQUESTS FROM MEMBERS. WHO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN AND YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY CAPABLE AND AND AND -- IF THIS AUDIT COMES THROUGH -- ZADA REQUEST CONSIDER YOU GONNA DO DE GOOD JOB I KNOW YOU WELL IN YOUR YOUR VERY DILIGENT AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW. MESSES WITH THE CHAIRS REMINDERS OVER OVER AGAIN WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN REQUEST TODAY ALONE AND WHERE YOU ARE HERE TWO HOURS INTO THE MEETING. DURING ALSO AT THE A TALKING ABOUT THE DETAILS WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO REQUEST YOUR SEATS MEMBERS WAITING TO PRESENT THEIR REQUEST [inaudible] ADEN. YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN RAKED OVER THE COALS PRETTY THOROUGHLY YESTERDAY AND TODAY IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGES TODAY SACRAMENTO BEE -- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT. NO SURPRISE I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THE DNC -- WOULD -- YEAH I THINK I DON'T KNOW WHY THE HEAT THAT THEY'RE UNDER RIGHT NOW -- IT WHERE WHERE SHOULD I PRIORITIZE THIS REQUEST GIVEN ALL OF THE POLITICS ALL OF THE PUBLIC SECURITY GIVEN THE THE CLEAR STATEMENT OF OF RESPONSIVENESS FROM THE DMV. VERSES ALL THE FIFTEEN OTHER REQUESTS THAT WOULD BETTER UP THAT ARE GONNA ALSO TAKE UP THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ALSO GONNA AT YOU EXPLORE IMPORTANT ASPECTS THE GOVERNMENT FUNCTION WELL. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE DON'T TAKE A POSITION ON AUDITS BUT BUT WHAT WE TYPICALLY THIS AUDIT. HAS STATEWIDE IMPACT. FROM THERE ARE SOME ODD IT'S THAT WE ARE ASKED TO DO BY THIS COMMITTEE AND BY MEMBERS THAT ARE VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIC DISTRICT OR CONSTITUENCY -- IF I WERE TO COMPARE THIS AUDIT TO SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE I WOULD HAVE HONOR WE WOULD PUT A TEAM ON THIS AUDIT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE THAT'S IN THE FOREFRONT. OF EVERYBODY'S MIND BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE INTERACTIONS WITH DMV. BUT CERTAINLY IT'S THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION IF THE COMMITTEE FEELS THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS THAT DMV IS TAKING AND THEY DON'T YOU DON'T THINK NOW'S THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO AN AUDIT. MEAN UP OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THE COMMITTEES -- DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO THAT BUT BUT WHEN WHEN WE LOOKED AT AUDIT SENATOR WE TRY. TO EVEN IF WE DO GET AN AUDIT THAT'S MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED WE TRY. TO LOOK AT THE SCOPE AND SEE IF THEY'RE THINGS THAT WE CAN ANALYZE AND ASSESS THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT STATEWIDE ON CONSTITUENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS CLEARLY IS AN AUDIT THAT. ALREADY THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT IS GOING. TO ARM TOUCH ON PRETTY MUCH EVERY MEMBER'S DISTRICT -- AS FAR AS CONSTITUENTS HAVING TO TO DEAL WITH DMV I I I APPRECIATE WHAT THE DIRECTOR SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE HEARING YESTERDAY. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TAKEN STEPS BOMB BUT WHAT THE MEMBERS ARE ASKING US TO DO IS. TO GET IN THERE AND ASSESS OKAY WHAT IS THE STEPS ARE THEY GOING TO ANALYZE HEALTH EFFECTIVE THOSE STEPS ARE DO THEY HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO COURSE CORRECT IF THOSE STEPS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS A SYSTEM. BOB WHAT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO FINISH THIS. WELL AS I SAID IN A WHEN I PRESENTED THE THE ANALYSIS THAT THE AUDIT IS ITS BUDGET ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR THE AUDIT TEAM. THAT JUST ONE AUDIT TEAM WOULD TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS NOW WHAT WE COULD DO -- IF THE COMMITTEE WANTED US TO GET THIS DONE BY A CERTAIN TIME FRAME THE MEMBERS DIDN'T ASK FOR A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME -- WE COULD PUT MORE THAN ONE TEAM ON THIS JOB BECAUSE WERE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DISTRICT OFFICES SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE TEAM GOING FROM SACRAMENTO TO LOS ANGELES TO CENTRAL VALLEY. WE WOULD HAVE TEAMS OFGOING OUT CONCURRENTLY AND THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF CALENDAR TIME IT WOULD TAKE US TO GET THE JOB DONE. BOB CESCA CHAIR INTO IS IT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SO SEVEN MONTH PROCESS I GUESS IT COULD BE SPED UP A BIT -- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LITTLE LESS THAN A MONTH LEFT -- OF SESSION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE FEASIBILITY ARE OF IF YOU KNOW IF IF THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRESS MADE OVER THE COURSE THE NEXT MONTH. BY THE D. M. V.. TO RECONVENE THIS COMMITTEE AT THE VERY END OF OF SESSION -- TO TO RECONSIDER. I THE THE THIS AUDIT REQUEST IT IS THAT WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY ENTERTAIN. WELL IF EVER COMMITTEE WORK -- TO NOT MOVE FOR TODAY. CERTAINLY WEAKENED -- CONSIDERED THE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVENING A SPECIAL SESSION -- IT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER. AS THE AUDITOR IS SUGGESTING -- EXPEDITING. AND PRIORITIZE IN THIS AUDIT REQUESTS -- I A I THINK -- WHETHER WE DO IT TODAY OR AT A SPECIAL SESSION. OF COURSE WE WE WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AS A COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE. YEAH ARTISTS AT IT AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR WITH ARMS PICKED UP IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO WE HAVE TAKE ABOUT ANYWAY YEAH I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND I'M JUST ASKING IF WE IF. IF IT IF WE WANT. TO MY FOR TODAY ON I THINK PART OF WHAT'S WHAT'S YOU KNOW OUR YEAH THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN A TYPICAL REQUEST BECAUSE THE STATE WIDE SCOPE BUT IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT BECAUSE I WE'VE GOT A YEAH WE'VE GOT THE ATTENTION OF SOME OF THE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS WEIGHING. IN ON THIS I THINK THAT THE FOLKS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RECOGNIZE WHAT A PROBLEM THEY HAVE ON THEIR HANDS AYE I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT DAY. OUR ARE TAKING SOME OWNERSHIP IN UNDERSTAND. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THEM TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS ISSUE AND GET THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED A SAP? AND I THINK THAT HE'S PUTTING SOME PERSONAL -- CREDIBILITY ON THE LINE WITH REGARD TO THIS SO IT IN THAT SENSE IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE -- TYPICAL I REQUEST WHERE AND THERE'S NOT THIS LEVEL OF COMMITMENT AND ATTENTION FROM THE HIGHER UPS IT WITHIN OUR SO I AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I AM -- THAT'S ONE GRAPPLING WITH RIGHT NOW TO MY VOTE ON THIS ON THIS REQUEST ON THIS DAY [inaudible] MISTER CHAIR. THE I. O. RESPONSE TO SENATOR ALAN [inaudible] YES. BUT CENTER AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ONE IN QUESTION I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I WOULD SAY THAT. IF YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS NEW. IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT HAS -- BEEN GOING ON FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE I THINK IT'S A CULTURAL ISSUE AND IT LASTS MORE THAN JUST A REAL ID ISSUE. I THINK HAVING THE AUDITOR WITH THEIR EXPERTISE TO RESOURCES AND BEING A INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE ENTITY LISELOTTE TO SWAY AND RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP BUT DMB. YES IT'S GOING TO THE GOVERNOR'S LEVEL IS GOING TO LEGISLATURE OFTEN BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE AUDITOR BRING THOSE RESOURCES TO DMV AND CANDIDLY I'M NOT SURE. THE DMV ALONE CAN HANDLE AND REPAIRED THE SITUATION I THINK THEY NEED RESOURCES TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE FACING RIGHT NOW ONE WOULD READ THAT'S PRICEY MY CONCERN I GUESS WE'RE GONNA ASK THEM NOW TO SPEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO FUND THE AUDIT -- WHEN YOU KNOW? WHEN THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO GO TOWARD ADDRESSING THE ISSUES AT HAND -- THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE THE CHALLENGE RIGHT ON THAT WOULD COULD RELATE IT WILL FIND IT'S FUNNY I MEAN YOU. YOU DID NOT GIVE HIS NOTORIOUS AGGREGATE CALIFORNIA LIVES THERE'S OUR MOST -- FAVORITE WHIPPING BOY -- IN GOVERNMENT AYE AND YET I THINK WE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE FOR AWHILE -- OUT FROM ITS. FROM FROM WHERE IT WAS -- BACK WHEN I WAS A KID AND SO THIS SO IT'S SO SO NOW I THINK THE OF SOME OF THE OLD LEGACY IS. REARING ITS UGLY HEAD IT'S BEEN A CAN OF AN UNFORTUNATE CONFLUENCE OF FACTORS FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE AND REAL ID AND UP A BUNCH OF OF OF OF STRESSES IN AND PER AND AND IN EXACERBATIONS OF OF SOME EXISTING CULTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN THAT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT I DO THINK. THAT THEY ARE AND I DO THINK THAT THEY THEY'VE IMPROVED QUITE A BIT -- SINCE SINCE I WAS YOUNGER THOUGH THE NOW [inaudible] YOU KNOW. THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW SET OF PROBLEMS SO IT'S IT'S AND IT'S A IT'S A IT'S IT I THINK I JUST BECOMES A CHALLENGE OF HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE USING OUR MONEY EFFECTIVELY AND HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THAT. YOU KNOW I I GUESS IT COMES DOWN A TRUST ISSUE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME FOLKS HERE WHO. FEEL AS THOUGH I THE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP IS IS LOST THE TRUST OF THE COMMITTEE ON THOSE OF US WHO WE KNOW WE'RE HEARING FROM THEM THAT THEY'VE HEARD THIS PROBLEM LOUD AND CLEAR IN THE DAY. I KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND AND THEY'RE READY TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY US. AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE DILEMMA THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR FULLER -- I'M NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO THE DETAILS OF THE PROBLEM ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE DOCUMENTED FROM MY AND AT MY OWN OFFICES THE EXACT WEIGHT -- ON CERTAIN DAYS AND CERTAIN TIMES AND IT STE [inaudible] IT'S TERRIBLE. SO -- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU -- TO SEE IF THIS IS INDEED A SYSTEM WIDE PROBLEM WHICH IT SOUNDS TO ME IT IS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S CRASHING ON FIVE PLATFORMS AND I JUST WANTED. TO GET YOUR FEELINGS ON THOSE FIVE PLATFORMS AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUDITOR TIM TO CONSIDER MOVING THIS UP AND SHORTENING THE TIME LINE. BECAUSE IF WE ARE TRULY IN A SYSTEMIC. CRISIS THAT WILL EASILY MOVED TO ASSIST THEM SYSTEMIC CRASH OF VITAL SERVICES FOR THE STATE OF THINK WE NEED TO PUT IT AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THE BLAME IS OR WHY IT IS AND GET SOME REAL PARAMETERS ON THE PROBLEM. SO A YOU STATED AND AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING EXTENDED SATURDAY SERVICE TO S.. THAT HELPED A THOUGH IT DIDN'T FIX IT BUT STEPPED. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IN ARE AREA THE HEAT IS A HUNDRED AND TWO DEGREES TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN AS I DRIVE BY THERE EVERY DAY THEIR PEOPLE ARE STANDING OUTSIDE IN LONG LINES AND IT'S JUST. AWFUL. SO. I'M NUMBER ONE YOU STATED THAT YOUR APPROACH CONSISTED OF REVIEWING THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES I THINK YOU SAID YOU HAD SOME AROUND A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE OFFICES. FOR BEST PRACTICES AND IF THEY'RE SERVICING THE CUSTOMER. YES WE ARE DO WE WE HAVE DONE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT HAVE YOU COLLECTED IN THE DATA ON THE PARAMETERS OF THIS PROBLEM SUCH AS WHAT OF WHAT IS THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER SERVICE TIME YOU STATED EARLIER EVIDENTLY THAT THE REAL ID TOOK FIVE MINUTES. WHICH AT BUT THE WHOLE TOTAL SPECTRUM OF THAT RELY DE A PROBLEM WAS ONLY LIKE ABOUT BUT SO ARE UNKNOWN. WITH THEIR EXPLAIN WHATEVER LIKE HE ENDED DENNIS KITCHEN IS THIS ADDING ADDITIONAL TALK TIME EXPLAIN TO THE BECAUSE MCGUIRE IDEAS WHAT DOCUMENTS YOU NEED TO BRING AND AND EXPLAIN THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS NOT A CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS OF ITS EDUCATE THE CUSTOMER WE'VE DONE A LOT IT. MEDIA IN TERMS OF WE SO. JUST TO BIGGEST QUICK AS WE CAN KEEP GOING IT. IT'S ABOUT AS YOU SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EXTRA PER CUSTOMER. LARA RELIED OKAY SO. IF WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER SERVICE TIME PER VISIT IS ACROSS THE SYSTEM WE DO KNOW AND WE DO KNOW BY EACH OFFICE WHAT THE WAIT TIME IS WE HAVE A SPREADSHEET NOT THE WAIT TIME. THE SERVICE TIME THE AVERAGE SERVICE TIME FOR THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT THE AUDITOR TO HELP YOU DO BENCHMARK THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM BY HAVING A DASHBOARD NOT BY INDIVIDUAL OFFICES. BUT ACROSS THE SYSTEM A MULTI WINE A MOMENT AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT. SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU COULD POST ON YOUR WEBSITE THIS WOULD BE A HELP JUST TO START IF YOUR ELECTRONIC TICKET SYSTEM. ACTUALLY GIVES YOU FEEDBACK ON HOW MANY CUSTOMERS ARE COMING A WHAT THEY NEED YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUBLISH A YELP LIKE. CUSTOMER FLOW CHART RIGHT ON YOUR WEBSITE IT SAYS THESE ARE THE BUSIEST DAYS. AND GET YOU THROUGH THE CRISIS INTO YOU CAN FIX THE BUSIEST DAYS A NUMBER THE NUMBER OF DAYS YOU CAN ALSO BETTER ESTIMATE WHAT YOUR SERVICES INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING OKAY I'M GONNA PUT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE ON SATURDAY SOMEWHERE -- BECAUSE THEY GOT AWAY TIME AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE WAIT TIMES ARE REPORTED REPORTED ACCURATELY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE REPORTING FROM THE TIME THEY PICK AT THE TAKE THE WINDOW OR IF THEY'RE REPORTING FROM THE MINUTE THEY GET THE LINE AT THE BACK OF THE LINE -- WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE. PICTURE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE AUDITOR CAN DO ON FIVE LEVELS ONE IS ON JUST THE TECHNICAL PROCESSES WHICH IS IMMEDIATE MANAGING THE CROWD REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF OF THE SERVICE TIME THAT. THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE PEOPLE THAT COME AND AHEAD OF TIME SO YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE A PREDICTIVE MODE THE YOU CAN DISCUSS FOR THE UNIONS OR WHATEVER PUT YOUR PEOPLE OUT THERE -- AND PUT SOME OF THAT ON ON THE WEBSITE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CURE THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THESE ARE YOUR GOALS TO GET THE WAIT TIME DOWN. NUMBER ONE THAT'S I THINK THAT'S NUMBER ONE THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN NUMBER TWO IS CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST YOUR SAYING REAL IDEAS THE WHOLE PROBLEM BUT IT'S BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OR SOMETHING SINCE WE KNEW ABOUT REAL ID. SAW HOW MUCH TIME IS THAT ACTUALLY ADDED THE SYSTEM HOW MUCH TIME HAS EVERYTHING ELSE ADDED TO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN GETTING THE WAIT TIMES DOWN BY DOING SOMETHING BY JUST TRYING TO PAY OVERTIME AND US JUST LIKE THIS AND YOU MONEY TO PAY OVERTIME AND EMPLOYEES TO SKILLET BURNED OUT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED IF THIS IF WE DON'T BENCHMARK THIS SYSTEM. AND I THINK THE THE WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON THAT'S LIKE PLATFORM. TO ADD TREATMENT OF PEOPLE NEEDING SERVICE HOW DO YOU HOW IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR THOSE OFFICES THAT HAVE SAT THERE AND THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER EVEN HEARD ABOUT IT NOBODY'S EVEN DOING IT THAT WOULD PREFER FEIGNING OUT THERE. AND HUNT THEM IN THE NEWSPAPERS FINDING OUT BUT NO ONE ELSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS. SO THE WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TREATMENT DOWN THE ROAD YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF QUALITY CONTROL [inaudible] AND PERHAPS THE AUDIT CAN HELP YOU DOCUMENT Y. BENCHMARK. WHERE YOU CAN PUT THE MOST RESOURCES FIRST TO MAKE THE MOST IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE AND THAT WOULD BE SO THE SECONDARY? ISSUE THAT THEY CAN HELP WITH. I THINK AND THE NEXT THING THAT THEY CAN HELP WITH WAS HR IMPLEMENTATION. SO WHAT IS YOUR AGE ARE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR SURGES ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CUSTOMER FLOW TIME IS A MUCH INCREASED TIMAEUS. AND WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR ROLE OUT FOR ONLINE SERVICES THAT A RETIEF. WHAT'S ROUTINE WHAT'S EMERGENCY AND WHAT HAS TO BE DONE BY YOU. AND DO HAVE A DESPERATE THAT CAN YOU SHARE THAT WITH US IF YOU CAN THAT WOULD BE I THINK HELPFUL WE MIGHT EVEN WANT TO HAVE A SPECIAL SESSION AND MOVE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. TO HELP YOU. BUT COMING IN AND SAYING. WELL WE A LOT MORE WORK FROM EVERYBODY BECAUSE MONEY BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE. EXACTLY WENT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE MAGNITUDE SYSTEM WIDE OF THE PROBLEM. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP LIKE WORKING OUT SERVICING CUSTOMERS AND BEST PRACTICES. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP ANY OF US EVEN THOUGH IT'S WELL INTENDED AND THAT'S PROBABLY ALL YOU CAN DO WITHOUT WATER RESOURCES AND WITHOUT US HAVING A BETTER PICTURE. LAST BUT NOT LEAST I THINK YOU NEED -- TO LET US KNOW WHAT THE EMERGENCY SERVICES NEEDS ARE BECAUSE THAT'S THAT THAT'S GONNA GET IN. THAT'S IT IS EVERYWHERE AND THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY TRAVELLERS WHO LOSE THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE. WHO ABSOLUTELY ARE STRANDED SOMEWHERE NOW THEY CANNOT GO TO THAT DIEM THE AWAY FIVE HOURS? SO I THINK THE AUDITOR COULD HELP US GAIN INSIGHT INTO THAT IF WE MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY AND MAYBE WE COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ROLLING OUT RESOURCES BETTER. IF WE UNDERSTOOD THIS SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED IN WHAT WAYS AND WHAT SPECIFIC. THE CIVIC HAPPENINGS LAST BUT NOT LEAST -- HAVE YOU A DOZEN SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED CONTRACTING MORE THE SERVICES OUT WITH PRIVATE BUSINESSES. SUCH AS STRIP PLAYER SOMEONE ELSE YOU ALREADY HAVE A LINK TO THAT DID THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE TOO MUCH MORE WORK WITH WHAT. I HAVE YOU PUT THAT ON THE WEBSITE OR HAVE YOU DONE AN OUTREACH TO THE PUBLIC TO LET PUBLIC NOW HERE'S A PLACE YOU CAN BE DIVERTED. TO YES SO WE WE DO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR AUTO CLUB AND A WE HAVE A SELF SERVICE TERMINALS IN A FIELD OFFICE IN RETAIL LOCATIONS SO WE DO. AND WE HAVE REGISTRATION SERVICES WE DO COMMUNICATE THAT OUT TO THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES YOU CAN DO A TRANSACTIONS ONLINE WE DO COMMUNICATE DATA. HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TURNING AWAY AND THE AVERAGE FOR NOT COMPLETE PAPERWORK? A WEEK I DON'T HAVE ANY WILL BE COLLECTING THAT WITH OUR TRIAGE SO WE ARE NOT THAT'S THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO COLLECT OTHER OLD AUDIT INFORMATION YOU NEED. NEEDED UP BECAUSE BECAUSE THOSE ARE EVEN COUNTED IN. THE PEOPLE LIKE COMING BACK TO A THREE AND FIVE TIMES AWAITING FELINE. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE EVEN CONSIDERED ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT PROBLEM. WHICH IS JUST HOW TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. AND HOW TO ROLL OUT MORE ON YOUR WEBSITE AND OUT REACHES THROUGH WHAT LIKE AIRPORTS OR WHATEVER YOU CAN HAVE THINGS THAT ARE CITIES WE WHATEVER. WE DO HAVE SIGNAGE AT AIRPORTS WE HAVE VIDEOS PLAYING THAT DONE SIX AIRPORTS WHERE YOU'RE IN LINE SIX AND CAN'T YEAR IN LINE TO GET YOUR TIAS SAY. THAT JACK WE DO HAVE A VIDEO THERE A WE'VE DONE A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA WE'VE DONE AND NEWSPAPER ADS WE'VE DONE WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUT HER ARTICLES ON IN THE DAY. WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US YES DEMO OR ELSE WHY DON'T YOU WITH A? WE HAVE THIS MANY PLACES SOLVED AND THIS MANY PLACES STILL PROBLEM AT THESE TYPES OF THE DAY AND THIS IS THE ROLL OUT PLAN AND THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL BUT THAT'S A HUGE HUGE TASK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME HELP WITH BINGE PARKING IN A I A HURRY I THINK. SO I'M GOING TO BE ASKING US TO CONSIDER THIS A SYSTEM WIDE FAILURE. AND TRYING TO SPEED UP THE DATA COLLECTION FOR YOU THROUGH THE AUDIT PROCESS -- SO THAT WE CAN THEN HAVE EVIDENCE TO ROLL OUT HELPED YOU THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ETCETERA DID YOU WANNA FOLLOW UP BILL I THINK YOU OKAY CHO OKAY -- NOW IS THE TIME FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT -- WOULD LIKE TO ASK A INDIVIDUALS I EXPECT THERE MAY BE SOME STRONG.

MY NAME IS MARIAM EXAM I WORK A DAY IN FEE FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND I WORKING THE FIELD OFFICE AND OPERATION AND I KNOW IT FAIRLY WELL. AND YOU DEFINITELY NEED AN AUDIT FOR YOUR CONSTITUENT FOR THE TAXPAYERS MONEY YOU NEED AND NOT. A GOOD BUSINESS SPROUT OF TO HAVE ANOTHER THAT YOU SAW HOW WOULD YOU SPEND THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. AND NOT THE TO REVIEW IN OVERRODE UNIT WHAT I WAS USED TO WORK WITH US SO MANY MILLION TO ASK. THE TO GET STATE OF THE ART SCANNERS OKAY. IT'S LIKE GETTING A BRAND NEW CADILLAC SAID OF GETTING ONE DRIVERS TO DRIVE TO AUTOMATIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE 15% PUSHING THE PROJECT WITH THE BRICKS ON PUFF PUFF OF THE 15% OUT HANDICAP OR CANNOT WHICH FIFTY FIVE OTHER SITTING CHEATING BLUES OTHER.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALRIGHT -- CLOSING COMMENTS FROM THE REQUESTING [inaudible] MEMBERS. BUT WAS CHARMED ME MEMBERS UP PUSH YOUR TIME YOUR PATIENCE. I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT RIGHT NOW WE TRULY DO KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE TO SOLVE THIS DILEMMA. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE DMV HAS RIGHT NOW THE CAPABILITIES TO SOLVE ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THEM. WE GIVE YOU SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR AND YET THE WAIT TIMES ARE LONGER THAN EVER I BELIEVE THIS AUDIT IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. FOR THE RIGHT DIRECTION NO PURPOSE THE ART IS NOT THE POINT FIGURES IS NOT TO LAY BLAME. IN THIS SITUATION THE PURPOSE OF AN AUDIT IS TO BRING IT INDEPENDENT. OBJECTIVE OUTSIDE ENTITY. TO BRING THEIR EXPERTISE THEIR RESOURCES AND THEIR GUIDANCE TO HELP SOLVE [inaudible] THIS ISSUE. WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE TO GO TO GET YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND YOUR REAL WHY DO YOU USE? AND BOTH OF COURSE OF GOVERNMENT MANDATES THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO BETTER. YOU MUST YOU BETTER. BUT ALSO WE NEED FOR CALIFORNIANS LIKE AVAILABLE CUSTOMERS THAT YOU DESERVE. WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER ARMS WITHOUT I WILL. EFFORTS TO MIND MY COLLEAGUE FOR HIS COMMENTS. THANK YOU I'M MEMBERS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE -- THE TIME A THAT YOU SPENT IN THIS I DID JUST RISK WITH RESPECT. TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABOUT THE AUDIT NOT. WHAT DO WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A FIRST RATE AUDITOR? WE KNOW THE HISTORY THAT WHEN WE HAND OFF THIS KIND OF NOT RESPONSIBILITY IT IS DONE DONE EXCEEDINGLY WELL AND THE FRUITS OF THAT EFFORT WE SEE. TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND WHETHER YOU CONSIDER A THE DMV TO BE. A COMPETENT AND CANNED SELF CORRECT OR WHETHER YOU THINK OF AS MANY CALIFORNIANS DO THAT THEY'VE LOST. CONFIDENCE IN THE D. M. V.. IT IS A TOOL THAT IS VITALLY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND FIX THE PROBLEM. ADD YOU HAVE HEARD THE UP WILLINGNESS OF THE AUDITOR TO CUT THE TIME TO MAKE IT VERY VERY -- QUICKLY IN TIME RESPONSIVE AND I ALSO THAT WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T SAY THERE ARE SOME. A MUCH BIGGER AUDIENCE WATCHING. THEN JUST US IN THIS ROOM. THAT THESE ARE THE LITERALLY TENS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IT HAD THE DIFFICULTY THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED HERE. HELLO. CAN BE ON THE WAY. AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUST. THAT THE AUDITOR KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING AND WILL PROVIDE IN A QUICK PERIOD OF TIME. THE NECESSARY PATHWAY TO FIX THIS. WE DO NEED TO HAVE MORE TIME IN THIS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM FOR A LONG LONG TIME. SO LET'S GIVE THE AUDITOR THE GREEN LIGHT. AND I THINK WE WILL GET TO A GREEN LIGHT AT THE WAITING LINES MUCH MUCH QUICKER [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IDEA. OF BEFORE I CALL FOR THE VOTE -- MOTION'S BEEN MADE BY MR COSTA SECOND BY MS BAKER. I WOULD LIKE SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW I RESERVED MY RECOMMENDATION -- FOR THIS REQUEST UNTIL -- AFTER HEARING UPON HEARING FROM -- ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS AS WELL AS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT TO HAVE MADE THE EFFORT. TO COME TO THE HEARING -- I AM CONVINCED THAT -- THAT'S THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING AUDIT -- THERE'S NO STATE AGENCY THAT TOUCHES THE LIVES OF MORE CALIFORNIANS AND THE DMV. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND THAT -- THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER AN AUDIT AT THIS TIME. WHAT HELP OR HINDER WITH IT THE? ONGOING -- PROGRESS -- THAT THE DMV IS MAKING IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. A HOWEVER AS MISTER OBERNOLTE INDICATED EARLIER -- AUDITS ARE NOT NECESSARILY PUNITIVE THEY CAN BE HELPFUL. AND I THINK. THE DMV AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS ALL THE HELP THAT WE CAN GET -- AND SHORTENING THEIR WAIT TIMES CALIFORNIANS AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS AUDIT.

ALRIGHT WHO'S NEXT ETCETERA STONE YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S THIS IS ITEM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE TWENTY FOUR THE GOLD COAST [inaudible] HEALTH PLAN. SENATOR THANK YOU -- HONORABLE CHAIR HONORABLE MEMBERS -- MADAME AUDITOR I SEE YOU SEE I I JUST WANNA BEFORE I START MY PRESENTATION JUST WANT TO APPLAUD YOU ALL FOR THE THE VERY HARD WORK THAT YOU DO IN DIVING INTO THE THE WEEDS OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I HAVE TO SAY I'M. I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE HOW YOU ALL WORK TOGETHER TODAY. BUT TODAY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF BY MY COLLEAGUE OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOP COSTA. I ASK YOU TO APPROVE THE AUDIT OF THE GOLD COAST HEALTHCARE PLAN IN VENTURA COUNTY. THE REASON I ASK FOR THIS IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE THIS COUNTY RUN HEALTHCARE PLAN IS PUTTING INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES IN VENDOR ARE IMPOTENT MENTOR COUNTY. AT RISK OF BANKRUPTCY AND SEVERAL AND ALREADY BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE DOWN. MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES AND ENTER A COUNTY DESERVE BETTER AND THE ACTIONS OF THE GOLD COAST HEALTH CARE DESERVE THE SCRUTINY. OF AN AUDIT TO FIND OUT IF THEIR DECISIONS HAVE BEEN. THE BEST FOR THOSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED TO CREATE GC HP AS A COUNTY ORGANIZE HEALTH. SYSTEMS MODEL. AFTER BEGINNING SERVICE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY WERE FLAG BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR SOME FISCAL INEFFICIENCIES. SO THEY CHOSE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR A NEW PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER WERE AS WE COMMONLY REFER TO THEM AS P. B. M.'S. WHICH WAS AWARDED TO A COMPANY CALLED OPTUM OUR ACTS. THIS IS THE POINT THAT PHARMACIES BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REIMBURSEMENTS FOR GENERIC AND BRAND NAME DRUGS THAT THEY WERE PROVIDING TO THEIR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. THE LARGEST PROBLEM FOR PHARMACIES HAS BEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CLAW BACKS OF THIS IS WHEN THE PBM DEMANDS REFUNDS -- FOR REIMBURSEMENT SET OF ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO PHARMACIES AT AND THEY CLAIM IT WAS DUE TO ALLEGE CODING ERRORS BY THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS. THIS IS BECAUSE MANY INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES TO GET BACK PAYMENTS THAT WERE IN THEIR MINDS ARE READY BELOW THE COST OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED. MANY OF THESE FARMERS HIS BELIEVE THEY CANNOT SURVIVE OF THIS PATTERN ON A UNDER REIMBURSEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT CLAW BACKS [inaudible] HAWKE CONTINUES. I RESPECTFULLY OF US ASK THE COMMITTEE TO AUTHORIZE AN AUDIT TO SEE IF GOAL BECAUSE HEALTH CARE FOLLOWED PROPER PROCEDURES. WHEN BRINGING ON THEIR NEW PBM TO EVALUATE WHETHER GOAL COAST POLICIES FOR ESTABLISHING REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE? REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE AND TO ASSESS WHETHER THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROCESS. IS ADEQUATE INAPPROPRIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS REQUEST IN AT THE APPROPRIATE% TIME I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOME MY WITNESS DANIEL MARTINEZ FROM THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WHO'S IN SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU SENATOR AND BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN RECOMMENDATION IN SUPPORT OF YOUR I REQUEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE KEPT UP BE BRIEF UP MY NAME IS JENNY MARTINEZ A I WORK FOR CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. I LIKED HIM REMIND FOLKS DE AND TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST AT THEIR REAL PEOPLE BEING IMPACTED UP UP BY THIS CLUB BACK TO SENATOR STONE MANSION -- SEVERAL PHARMACISTS HAVE INFORMED OUR SITUATION THAT THEY'RE ON THE VERGE OF GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR THAT THEY ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESS ONE PHARMACIST I SPOKE TO RECENTLY INFORMED US THAT SHE HAD TO TAKE OUT A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PERSONAL LOAN. JUST FOR PAYROLL OVERHEAD AND HER HER DOORS OPEN UP I'M SAD TO REPORT SHE DID NOT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN AND THAT PHARMACY HAS CLOSED. ANOTHER PHARMACISTS I'VE SPOKEN TO A HOW TO STOP TAKES STOP TAKING A SALARY SHE USED UPPER SAVINGS SHE SOLD HER CAR. SHE PER HOUSE ON THE MARKET ALL JUST TO KEEP THE PHARMACY OPEN RIGHT NOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO SAY IT'S IT'S OPEN BUT IT'S ON THE VERY LAST STRING. BEFORE IT CLOSES -- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER THAT PHARMACIES GOING TO LAST. NONE OF THIS WAS REALLY A PROBLEM PRIOR TO OP TOMORROW XP COMING THE PBM BACK IN JUNE FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOMB AND THERE WERE SOME CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING A THIS THIS PBM BEING IMPLEMENTED AND THAT TIME. ON DURING THE HEARING WHICH DECIDED THE NEW PBM THERE WERE THREE FINALISTS THAT WERE SCORED UP ACCORDING TO WHAT WHAT WAS THE NECESSARY -- SCORING THAT THAT THAT THEY PLANNED NEEDED AND AUTUMN ENDED UP SCORING LOWEST UP OF THE THREE FINALISTS AND YET WERE SELECTED. AND SO -- THIS DESPITE THE OBJECTIONS OF SEVERAL INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AND OTHER THE OTHER FINALISTS AS WELL. UP IN IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS WHEN WE WERE FIRST CONTACTED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND DURING THAT THIS TIME WE HAD FIRST OUR FOLKS TO GO TO THESE COMMISSION MEETINGS THAT OVERSEE THE PLAN. TO VOICE THEIR OF CONCERNS BECAUSE THESE CALLBACKS RESTORED TO TAKE PLACE ALONG WITH THE NEGATIVE REIMBURSEMENTS. ON THAT WERE PLUMMETING AS SOON AS THIS PBM STARTED TAKING OVER -- I'VE BEEN GOING TO THESE COMMISSION MEETINGS PERSONALLY SINCE DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. TOM WE HAD. COMMUNICATED TO THE PLAN AT THAT TIME THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED PHARMACIES WERE IN DANGER OF CLOSING. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW. UP WHEN PHARMACIES CLOSE ACCESS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS BECOMES A PROBLEM. AND IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE THE GOLD COAST ONLY SERVES MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. AND WHEN THEY CAN'T. WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MINUTES NOT ONLY DO THEY? HAVE. PROBLEM MEDICAL PROBLEMS BUT COSTA COUNTY'S RISE WHICH MEANS COST THE STATE RISES AS WELL SO -- WITH THAT OUT OF JUST THE TRIP OVER TO TO THE STATE ON THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE S. CENTERED STONE INDICATED THIS IS AN AUDIT ESSENTIALLY OF GOLD COAST. UP BUT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT ANY STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE TYPICALLY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WHAT THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE IS WITH ESPECT TO MANAGED CARE ENTITIES -- BUT CLEARLY TO AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE THAT THE SENATOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAVE ASKED US TO LOOK AT IS THE WHOLE ARE OF PEOPLE PROCESS THAT WAS USED. IN DETERMINING AND SELECTING OPTIM OUR ACTS AS THE AS THE PBM ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION AND SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT DETERMINING WHETHER NOT GOLD COAST EXECUTED THE CONTRACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CONSTITUENTS. ARE AND THE PHARMACIES ABOUT BOTH THE BENEFICIARIES IN THE PHARMACIES IN THE REGION AND WHEN THE INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMMISSION AND VENTURA COUNTY THEIR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE COMMISSION. WAS IT A FULL DISCLOSURE -- OF INFORMATION OUT WHEN THEY WERE DETERMINING HOW HOW TO VOTE ON THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACTS REALLY WANTING THE MEMBERS WANTING TO UNDERSTAND WAS ACCURATE RELEVANT ROBUST INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION SO WE WOULD LOOK FOR THAT. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE OPERATIONS WHETHER NOT GOLD COAST IS REALLY PROVIDING SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OVER THE PBM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PBM IS. FOLLOWING LAWS REGULATIONS POLICIES KING AT REIMBURSEMENT RATES -- AND THEY'RE ASKING US TO DO A COMPARISON -- FOR FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR THAT GOLD CHO SIN OFF THE MAREK'S PROVIDE -- COMPARE THAT TO SOME OTHER MANAGED CARE AND SOME OTHER PBM SITS IN CALIFORNIA AND SEE IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND WHY ARE THERE THOSE DIFFERENCES. ARM AND THEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REALLY LOOKING AT GOLD COAST PRACTICES AND OUR PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHING WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SHOULD BE. DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THOSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE REASONABLE AND IF NOT WHAT STEPS DO THEY TAKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. THE BUDGET FOR THE AUDITOR AROUND TWO THOUSAND HOURS ALL THIS WOULD TAKE ONE TEAM ABOUT FIVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE FIELD WORK. GET THE AUDIT DONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- A WOULD LIKE TO NOW INVITE. TO IN REPRESENTS FROM THE GOLD COAST AND HEALTH PLAN COMPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TRANSMITTAL THAT'LL SINGULAR ROPES AND SMITH WE REPRESENT THE GOLD COAST HEALTH PLAN AND WE HAVE WITH YOU TODAY. A DOCTOR ANY FREEZES THE PHARMACY MANAGER WITH GOLD COAST THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME SOME HISTORY OF OF THIS LONG ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I AM DOCTOR IN FREEZE A PHARMACIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF GOLD COAST HEALTH PLAN THE STATE FUNDED PUBLIC AGENCY. SERVING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IN VENTURA COUNTY. THE PLAN APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AND THE ON IT REQUEST. THIS AUDIT REQUEST ADDRESSES FIRST THE SELECTION OF THE PLANS PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER OR PBM. SECOND PHARMACY REIMBURSEMENT RATES. AND THIRD RECRUITMENTS DESCRIBED AS CLAW BACKS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PLAN CONDUCTED A THOROUGH PUBLIC PVM PROCUREMENT PROCESS. CULMINATING IN THE PLANS GOVERNING COMMISSION SELECTION ADOPTED MAREK'S. SHORTLY AFTER THE INCOME IT PBM SUED THE COMMISSION OVER AT SELECTION PROCESS. THE COURT DENIED THE PETITION IN ITS ENTIRETY. OTHER BIDDERS DID NOT SHOWING THE LAWSUIT. NOR WAS THE RULING APPEALED. WE BELIEVE THAT AN AUDIT WOULD REVIEW MATTERS PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED BY THE BY THE COURT. THE SECOND AREA OF FOCUS IS THE PHARMACY REIMBURSEMENT RATES DUE TO THE CONCERN OF INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES ABOUT RATES. PLAN HIRED AN INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A MARKET RATE ANALYSIS COMPARING CURRENT RATES PRIOR RATES AND INDUSTRY AVERAGES. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE RATES ARE WITHIN MARKET FOR A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE. THE FINAL AREA OF FOCUS IS THE RECRUITMENT SUPERCLUB BACKS. IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF SERVICE OP TAMARA ACTS MADE SEVERAL PRICING ERRORS RESULTING IN OVERPAYMENTS TO PHARMACIES. A PLAN IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO RECOUP FUNDS OVERPAID TO PROVIDERS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST NOT ONLY UP TO MORE ACTS BUT ALSO THEIR CONTRACTING AGENTS. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE PROGRESS OF THE SUIT CLOSELY AS PART OF THE REGULAR MONITORING OF OUR PHARMACY NETWORK. OF UP MOST IMPORTANT. OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE PLAN IS OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR MEMBERS AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS. TO PHARMACY SERVICES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NO MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED ANY ACCESS ISSUES [inaudible] IN SUMMARY. THE COURT UPHELD THE PLANS PROCUREMENT PROCESS. AN INDEPENDENT RATE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THE RATES ARE WITHIN MARKET. THE OVERPAYMENTS WERE RECOUPED AS REQUIRED. IN LIGHT OF THESE ACTIVITIES IN THE NEW LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES. OUR POSITION IS THAT THIS AUDIT WILL REVIEW MATTERS PREVIOUSLY INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED THANK YOU. I ALSO WANTED -- TO EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REP CENTER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IF THEY WOULD LIKE. TO PLEASED TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS IF NOT. IT'S UP TO YOU. OKAY AS A OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS RUBIO. YES THE THE MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS PENDING LITIGATION AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS -- THE REASON I PULLED IT OFF CONSENT IS I WANTED TO JUST CHECK WHAT THE AUDITOR IN TERMS OF LITIGATION BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE HAD. OUR PREVIOUS REQUEST THAT WERE BEING LITIGATED AND HOW DO WE CONTINUE WITH THAT. SO UNDER OUR STANDARDS I'M HAVING MY CHIEF COUNSEL COME UP AND TALK -- OFFICIAL DO A BETTER JOB THAN I BUT UNDER OUR AUDIT STANDARDS. WE ARE WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM CONDUCTING ARTWORK THAT WE DETERMINE WHAT INTERFERE WITH AN ONGOING ONGOING LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATION SO WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WHERE. AND WHY HAVE AN ATTORNEY ASSIGNED EVERY AUDIT WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE AUDIT TEAM THAT WERE NOT STEPPING INTO AN AREA THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY INTERFERE WITH THE LITIGATION THEM NOW. STEPPING EARNERS RIDGEWAY CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE GOOD MORNING A WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LITIGATION QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A SUPERIOR COURT MATTER WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN AT THE EARLY PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH ON THESE AUDIT REQUESTS. I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT WE WOULD IDENTIFY ISSUES OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE AUDIT REQUEST AND THE LITIGATION. AS THE STATE AUDITOR HAS INDICATED WE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO SCOPE AROUND THOSE ISSUES IN OTHER WORDS PERHAPS SELECT A DIFFERENT PROVIDER SELECT DIFFERENT BLOOM MEDICATIONS THAT ARE THOSE THAT ARE. AT ISSUE IN THE LITIGATION. AND WE DO HAVE LIMITATIONS AS THE STATE ARE INDICATED IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO REPORT ON MATTERS AS WELL IF THEY IN FACT WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE ONGOING LITIGATION AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WORK. WITH THE AUDIT T. AS WE WENT THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE EITHER PARTY'S RIGHTS IN THAT PROCESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. MS BAKER IF YOU AYE AND I HAVE THAT SAME QUESTION I WON SKILL BUT MORE SPECIFIC -- THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY. IN THE OTHER MATTER IS DECIDED BY A JUDGE AND HOW THE PARTIES GO BACK AND FORTH BEFORE A JUDGE ON WHAT CAN BE DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER SIDE WHAT IS PRIVILEGED WHAT ISN'T. I I KNOW FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES COMMITTEE THAT YOU'RE VERY SENSITIVE WHAT'S PRIVILEGED INFORMATION. IT'S PERFECT BUT WILL YOUR WHEN YOU SAY WE WE ARE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T INTERFERE. THAT THAT INCLUDES THAT WE DON'T. AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOUR WORK COULD COUNTER ACT BEING CONSISTENT WITH A JUDGE'S ORDER ON THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY WHAT'S DISCLOSED THE OTHER SIDE. WE OUR REQUIRE WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THAT COURT ORDERS ANY SIMILAR ORDER OUR DUTY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION THAT WE OBTAIN IS THE SAME AS THE PARTIES TO DUTY TO PROTECT THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SO AGAIN. WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE ODDITY TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE NOT -- RELEASING ANY INFORMATION APPROPRIATELY BEAR IN MIND TOO THAT UNTIL THE AUDIT IS COMPLETE WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM RELEASING ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER THAT WE WOULD WORK WITH THE ODDITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WORK PAPERS WERE PROPERLY SORTED AT THE END OF THE JOB. IN THE EVENT WE GOT A SUPER REQUEST WILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COULD I JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THE PENDING LAWSUIT HERE. A FLEA YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE IS THAT THAT THE FIRST HEARING OF THE LAWSUIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN DECEMBER AND WILL. PROCEED ABOUT YOU KNOW THROUGH THE NEW YEAR OF NEXT YEAR. WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT AN AUDIT REPORT COMING OUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF OF THE LAWSUIT THAT'S FOCUSING ON THE VERY. ISSUES I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT THE COURT OF LAW AND THE PLAINTIFFS ARE LOOKING AT THAT THE AUDIT REPORTS GOING TO COME OUT WITH SOME SORT OF CONCLUSIONS AND AN OVERLAP AND SO. ONE WE ARE CONCERNED WITH WITH HOW THIS COULD INFLUENCE ANY PARTICULAR COURT CASE AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE IS SOME REDUNDANCY AND OVERLAP WITH TWO INDEPENDENT ENTITIES LOOK AT THAT THE SAME ISSUES. THAT'S HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. WELL AS AS AS MY CHIEF COUNSEL INDICATED WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LITIGATION SO IT'S HARD FOR US. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE SCOPE THAT CENTER STONE AND AND MISTER COST ARE ASKING US TO CONDUCT. HAS OVERLAP OR NOT I MEAN IF THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE IT THERE IS OVERLAP WERE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT WE CAN REPORT OUT -- ONCE WE COMPLETE THE AUDIT BECAUSE OUR ATTORNEY AND AS I SAID I HAVE AN ATTORNEY ASSIGNED EVERY AUDIT THAT ATTORNEY WILL BE TRACKING THAT LITIGATION. AND INFORMING ME AND INFORMING THE AUDIT. GOING THERE IS OVERLAP WE'VE HAD OTHER AUDITS WHERE THAT HAS OCCURRED AND WHAT WE DID WE WOULD HAVE WE'VE HAD TO BACK OFF. AND BASICALLY DISCLOSE IN THE FINAL REPORT. THAT WE COULD REPORT OUT ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE THERE WAS OVERLAP AND IT WOULD IN OUR VIEW BASED ON ADVICE FROM COUNSEL. WOULD HAVE INTERFERED SO WE WOULD WE WOULD DOWN TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. NONE OF THAT HELPS DENNIS US TO ME THAT NOW WOULD NOT ONLY WOULD YOU BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BUT AS A GENERAL. POLICY YEAH YOU ARE YOU ARE PRECLUDED FROM ADDRESSING. THE FACTUAL ISSUES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PENDING LITIGATION. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S UNDER THE UNDER THE AUDIT STANDARDS THAT WE FOLLOW WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM. IT IT THE WAY A STANDARD BREEDS AS WE HAD WE CANNOT INTERFERE WITH AN ONGOING WE CANNOT CONDUCT AUDIT WORK THAT COULD POTENTIALLY INTERFERE WITH AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION OR LITIGATION. SO AGAIN THAT'S WHERE WE'RE USING OUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. AND I'M CERTAINLY SEEKING ADVICE FROM COUNSEL AND THEN WE MAKE A DETERMINATION WE CAN'T EVEN GO THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO A AND WE WOULD HAVE TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WE ISSUE THE REPORT PUBLICLY THAT WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. IT HAPPENED ON THE MONTEBELLO AUDIT THAT WE DID OFFER SENATOR I THINK SENATOR MENDOZA AND OTHER MEMBERS REQUESTED THAT AUDIT. THERE WAS A THERE WAS ONGOING LITIGATION RELATED TO CONTRACTING PRACTICES AND WE DID SOME WORK IN THAT AREA BUT BASED ON COUNSEL'S ADVICE AND LOOKING AND MEETING WITH THE TEAM. I MADE THE DECISION WE CAN'T REPORT OUT ON THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ONGOING LITIGATION. AND OUR CONCLUSIONS MAY BE. PROBLEMATIC -- NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE LITIGATION IT COULD INFLUENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE WOULD WANT TO GO THERE BECAUSE WE CAN'T WITH STANDARDS SO WE WOULD CONDUCT OURSELVES THE SAME WAY IF THIS AUDITS APPROVED TARA. ANY -- COMMENTS OR ANY MEMBER MATTER. FOR SURE MEMBERS KATHY MUST WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIA REPRESENT THE SIXTEEN NONPROFIT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE STATE. ON JUST WANNA GO ON RECORD IN SORT OF ECHOING THE COMMENTS FROM GOLD COAST HEALTH PLAN WE THINK WHAT THEY DID IS THEY WENT TO PROPER PROCEDURES THEY WENT THEY DON'T HAD PROPER OVERSIGHT. AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS AUDIT IS RUDE WILL BE REDUNDANT APPRECIATE THE LEGAL DISCUSSION HERE HOPEFULLY THAT'LL HOLDS TRUE WHEN -- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS CERTAINLY ABOUT HAVING THIS HAPPEN WHILE THE LEGAL CASES MOVING FORWARD BUT AGAIN PROPER OVERSIGHT ON WE HAVE TO WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH DOLLAR THAT COMES TO OUR PLANTS FROM MEDICAID PROGRAM.

AND FOR THE COMMENTS SEEING NONE I'D FOR THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES SIR MISTER I JUST WANT. TO ENJOY THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LEGAL ISSUE I WOULD BE. SOMEWHAT SURPRISED IF THE JUDGE IN A COURT ACTION ALLOWS THE AUDIT REPORT IN. T THE EXTENT IT'S OF PLANTS THE ROLE OF THE JURY IN FINDING FACTS SO. I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I THINK APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS COULD BE. COULD BE TAKEN BY THE STATE OF HER AS SHE HAS CERTAINLY DONE IN THE PAST WHEN THESE ISSUES HAVE COME UP SO. IT'S MY COMMENT ON THE POINT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SERVICE JONES ELECT CLOSE. I THINK YOU MISSED CHAIRED APPRECIATE -- REPRESENTATIVES FROM GOAL COAST BEING HERE THAT THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IN -- IN THIS AREA OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE SAYING INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES ON THE VERGE OF CLOSING OR HAVING CLOTHES MUCH MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND MAYBE EVEN AND IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OF THE LAST WEEK WAS TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE OF MOVING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY GET THEIR MEDICATIONS TIMELY -- THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF INTER COUNTY THAT ARE ONLY SERVED BY INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE POPULATION CENTERS TO HAVE CHAIN STORES THAT ARE THERE. SO THIS IS AN ACCESS TO HEAR ISSUE I'VE I ISSUES I THINK THAT -- THE AUDITOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL IT MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IRAQ AND DOING IT TO JEOPARDIZE THE ON GOING -- LITIGATION THAT IS GOING ON AND AND FOR THAT REASON I WOULD RESPECTFULLY -- IN CONCURRENCE WITH LIKE MY COLLEAGUE ASK FOR YOUR CONCURRENCE AND AND AUDITING GOLD COAST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL THE RESIDENTS.

THANK YOU MS RUBIO. SEVERAL GAY FLORA JEFF THANK YOU CHAIR AND THIS IS -- JUST FOR THE RECORD -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE TWENTY FIVE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT AUDIT REQUESTS GREAT WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH -- GOOD MORNING I'M HERE TO ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVED AN AUDIT TO DETERMINE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY IN FAIRNESS ACT. IS INDEED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- WITH LITTLE DISRUPTION TO THE TAXPAYING PUBLIC. THE LEGISLATURE VESTED OF THE OP BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- OF ITS AUTHORITY TO COLLECT MANY OF THE TAXES AND FEES FOR WHICH IT HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE. AND STRIPPED FROM AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS RELATED TO TAX AND FEE COLLECTION. IT SEPARATE SUBSEQUENTLY INVESTED THOSE POWERS INTO A NEWLY CREATED. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS. IT DID SO WITH WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS COVERAGE DISRUPTED A PROCESS THAT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE BECOME USED. TO AND CHANGED INTERNAL PROCESS HE'S. AND CAPABILITIES THE STATED GOALS OF THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT WERE TO NUMBER ONE IMPROVE THE OPERATIONAL CULTURE TO ACCURATELY REPORT RELIABLE INFORMATION. NUMBER TO ENSURE THAT THE APPEALS PROCESS IS MAINTAINED IN AN ETHICAL MANNER. AND NUMBER THREE TO ENSURE BUDGETARY AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES ARE CARRIED THROUGH. TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW PARADIGM IS SERVING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THE WAY THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. I CALL UPON THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AN EXAMINATION OF THE INITIAL STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE ACT THE LEGISLATURE AND CALIFORNIANS AT LARGE TO DIRT DESERVE TO KNOW HOW WELL THIS TRANSITION IS PROCEEDING. AND WHETHER IS IT IS SUCCEEDING IN ACHIEVING ITS DESIRED GOALS. WITH -- MORE THAN A FEW FACTORS -- HAVE LET ME. TO MAKE THIS REQUEST INCLUDING BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS. LACK OF CONSUMER ABILITY ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH THE NEW AGENCIES AND CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER PRIOR ADMINISTRATIVE HOLDINGS. WILL CONTINUE TO SHAPE FUTURE DECISION MAKING. AT THE NEW DEPARTMENTS. WHEN THE BEER WE MAINTAIN HIS RESPONSIBILITIES DURING FISCAL YEAR? TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ITS BUDGET ALLOCATION WAS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR AN ENTITY THAT COLLECTED SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OR ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S BUDGET. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE BUDGET PROVIDES FOR REDUCE BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THE POV. OF THIRTY MILLION TO ACCOMPLISH IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED FUNCTIONS. WHILE THE FORMATION OF THE CT. CITY TFSA AN OTA HAS LED TO ADDITIONAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES. THEN THE AMOUNT OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION. WITH FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EMPLOYEES FOR THE CD TFA. AND TWENTY MILLION WITH EIGHTY EMPLOYEES FOR THE OTA. AS A RESULT THE SAME FUNCTIONS WHICH COST SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION LAST YEAR. WILL COST TAXPAYERS AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR MILLION THIS YEAR. THE UTILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL BUDGET EXPENDITURE. SHOULD BE EXAMINED BEFORE THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE CRAFT THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. SINCE A CD TFA HAS GONE ONLINE IN JANUARY THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION. AND THE ABILITY INTERACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY. TAXPAYERS WHO COMPLAINED THAT. THE NEW WEBSITE FOR REPORTING BUSINESS SALES TAXES. IS TOO CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED TO EFFECTIVELY USE. SECONDLY THEY CANNOT COMMUNICATE MESSAGES THROUGH THE WEBSITE. SPECIFICALLY FOR BUSINESS OWNERS WHO NEED TO ADD LOCATIONS -- TO THE PERMIT ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR ACCOUNT. THIRDLY THERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THE CD TFA BY TELEPHONE. STATING THAT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY MET WITH A BUSY SIGNAL. THE CT CDT FAA HAS REPORTEDLY HARASSED INDIVIDUALS FOR TAXES THEY DO NOT OWE. AND LOST TAXPAYERS SUPPORTING PAPERWORK WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE FALSE CLAIM ISSUES. AND FINALLY THE APPROPRIATE TAX FORMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE CD TFA WEBSITE. IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LA JOH NOTED IN A REPORT. THAT OF THE FIRST FOURTEEN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES HIRED BY THE OTA TO HEAR APPEALS. THIRTEEN PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR THE OTHER TAXING AGENCIES. SUCH AS THE F. T. P.. ALL THIS PRIOR WORK HISTORY OBVIOUSLY GIVES THEM SOME FAMILIARITY WITH TAX ISSUES IT ALSO TENDS TO BUILD. AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST AGAINST TAXPAYERS WHO ARE APPEALING TAX DECISIONS. THERE'S ALSO COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT SINCE THE OTA. HAS BEGUN TO HEAR APPEALS CASES NOT ONE OF THOSE CASES IS BEEN FOUNDER FAVOR THE TAXPAYER. AND OVER FIFTY CASES HAVE BEEN HEARD. A FEW CASES HAVE BEEN SETTLED OUTSIDE OF THE HEARING PROCESS. IN ADDITION OTA CASE BACKLOG WHICH INCLUDES ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED ACTIVE CASES. THIS ACT OF BACKLOG REPRESENTS ABOUT A YEAR OF TYPICAL CASE WORKLOAD. THIS BACKLOG STRAINS THE APPEALS PROCESS BUT ALSO DID DELAYS ADJUDICATION RIGHTS OF THE TAXPAYER IN QUESTION. IT APPEARS THAT THE TRANSITION FROM THE BEER WE TO THE CD TFA AND OJ. IS NOT PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY. THESE NEW AGENCIES MAY BE FACED WITH MANY OF THE SAME ISSUES WHICH LED TO THE CRITICISMS OF THE BEER WAITING. AND ULTIMATELY LED TO THE PASSAGE OF THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN GIVEN THESE FACTORS IT WOULD SEEM THAT REVIEWING THE TRANSITION TODAY. MAY HELP THESE NEW DEPARTMENTS AVOID THE PITFALLS WHICH LED TO THEIR CREATION AS WELL AS AIDING THE TAXPAYERS IN MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE SERVING THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. BY CONDUCTING THIS REVIEW IN THE A WE MAY BE ABLE TO ENSURE. THAT THE NEW DEPARTMENTS ARE LAUNCHING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE LEGISLATURE'S WISHES ARE BEING MET. AND THAT TAXPAYERS ARE BEING SERVED. I REQUEST THAT JACK J. LACK WOULD -- THROUGH THE USE OF THE STATE AUDITOR ENGAGE IN AN AUDIT REVIEW. OF THE NEW TAX IF YOU ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE UNDER THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT. THANKS SO ARE AGAINST YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT A REQUEST [inaudible] OKAY -- STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS CENTER GAINES INDICATED THIS WOULD BE WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES -- TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN CERTAINLY THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS SO FIRST LOOKING AT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION HE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT TAXPAYERS REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS INFORMATION VIA THE WEBSITE. ACCESS INFORMATION RELATED TO THEIR ACCOUNTS -- IN MAY BE ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS PERMIT INFORMATION A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT TAXPAYERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THROUGH THE WEBSITES WHO IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT THAT. IS ALSO ASKING US AS HE INDICATED IN HIS COMMENTS TO LOOK AT HOW THAT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT HANDLES TELEPHONE ENQUIRIES AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THAT IF THEY ARE HAVING ISSUES WHAT STEPS TO THE INTENT TO TAKE. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WITH RESPECT TO TAX APPEALS THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS R. O. T. A WHETHER OR NOT OTA HAS ESTABLISHED POLICIES THEY'VE BEEN IN PLACE. I THINK THIS THAT WELL LEGISLATION WAS AN WAS ON JULY OF SEVENTEEN ARE OTA STARTED HEARING APPEALS JANUARY OF THIS YEAR BUT RICK HE'S ASKING US TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT POLICIES HAVE THEY CREATED. WITH RESPECT TO PASS DECISIONS ARE MADE BY BE A WE ARE IF THOSE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN APPEALED. ARM AND IF SO DO THEY HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE TO DESCRIBE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY MAY DEVIATE FROM A DECISION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY MADE BY. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SO REALLY LOOKING AT ESTABLISH THEIR STRUCTURE AND WHAT THEIR POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS ARE -- MOVING FORWARD. WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO ENTITIES THERE'S AN OBJECTIVE ASKING US TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SEPARATION CLEARLY THERE WAS INTENT ON HAVING A SEPARATE OFFICE OF TAX OF FEAR APPEALS AND TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO. LOOKING AT CONFLICT CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES ARM ANY ASSOCIATED REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAFTED UP BY THE RESPECTIVE ENTITIES. YEAH CENTER GAINES MENTIONED THE LA OWES REPORT RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES HE'S ASKING US A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. O. T. A.'S HIRING POLICIES FOR HIRING A A L. JAY'S AND THEN CERTAINLY THERE POLICY FOR ASSIGNING A L. CHASED PARTICULAR CASES AND DO THEY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THEY'LL JAY'S PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT IF IT WAS FTP OR SOME OTHER. I'M ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AGAIN IS IN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THEN THE LAST TWO OBJECTIVES ARE LOOKING AT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY TO OTA. OUR REVIEW AND ASSESS THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ALE JAY'S IN THE FUNCTIONS WITHIN -- TEAR REALLY SEPARATE ARM FROM THE DIRECTORATE LEVEL THEY DO HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE NECESSARY AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AT BOTH ENTITIES -- WITH RESPECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HOW COST EFFECTIVE IS THIS NEW STRUCTURE IN COMPARISON TO THE PRIOR STRUCTURE. A WHEN IT WAS ALL UNDER BE A WEEK AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES THAT WOULD BE MORE IF AFFECT EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT EXCUSE ME -- AT THE BUDGET ABOUT TWENTY FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOURS THAT'S ABOUT A SIX MONTH PROJECT FOR AUDIT STAFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE IN THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS PLEASE COME FORWARD. PLACER ST THANK YOU SO MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE OF MY NAME'S NICK BUT TERRACE ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. OF THE DEPARTMENT AS YOU ALL KNOWS ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD -- MS THAT CREATED LAST YEAR JAN JULY FIRST OF LAST YEAR I STARTED JULY TWELFTH -- IT IN RESPONSE TO AB ONE OF TWO OF THE AIM OF WHICH WAS TO RISK RESTORE THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN INCREASE FAIRNESS CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY IN TAX ADMINISTRATION -- I CERTAINLY TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AS DOES THE ENTIRE STAFF AT CTF A JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- AS WELL AS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES REYES SPECIFICALLY IN OUR BY SENATOR GAINES -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THOUSANDS OF TRANSITION RELATED ITEMS IN THE PAST YEAR WE STILL HAVE. QUITE A FEW -- TO ADDRESS BUT YOU KNOW IT IS A BIG TASK WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON A YEARS WORTH OF PAST AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS THEM. THE BILL WE WILL -- CERTAINLY WAS NOT A STRANGER TO AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW -- WITH -- AUDIT FINDINGS OUTSTANDING INCLUDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD DEPARTMENT FINANCE DG ES. AND OTHERS -- AND WE ARE -- DILIGENTLY WORKING THROUGH POD THAT BACKLOG -- WE'RE ALSO IN THE FINAL STAGES OF THOSE BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC PLAN -- DRAFTING AFTER LOSING FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF OUR STAFF THAT WILL BE A THREE YEAR PLAN. OF THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ISSUED SHORTLY. THE CENTRAL ISSUE WHICH ADDRESSES I THINK MOST OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY SENATOR GAINES IS OUR CROSS SYSTEM WHICH IS OUR CENTRALIZED REVENUE OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM. WHICH HAS BEEN ONLINE FOR ONLY THREE MONTHS IT WENT ONLINE THREE MONTHS AGO YESTERDAY MAY SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR -- AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF OF ALMOST ALL OF THESE ISSUES -- BOB MY FIRST PRIORITY OUR FIRST PRIORITY AT THE DEPARTMENT IS IMPROVING THE CULTURE AND ETHICS OF THE DEPARTMENT TO THAT AND WE'VE DONE A LOT WE'VE INSTITUTED STRICT NEW ANTI NEPOTISM POLICY. WE'VE HAD TRAINED THE ENTIRE STAFF ON MERIT BASED HIRING PRINCIPLES WE'VE SET UP A HOTLINE TO REPORT MISCONDUCT. WE CONDUCTED AN EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY THE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST TO SERVE AS A BENCH LINE FOR AN ANNUAL PLAYING. COMPLAIN GATE THAT SURVEY -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING AGAINST THE OUTSTANDING AUDIT FINDINGS WE'VE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE RESTRUCTURED TO CREATE A CFO ORGANIZATION TO BRING TIGHTER FINANCIAL CONTROLS TO DEPARTMENT -- AS WELL AS JOHNSON RESTRUCTURING TO TRY TO BRING UNIFORMITY ARE AROUND THE STATE SO PEOPLE DO NOT THAT DIFFERENT TAX OUTCOMES. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH DEPARTMENT -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WHICH I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT GIVEN THE PUBLIC FUNDS THAT WERE EXPANDING. ARE THAT INVOLVES BOTH PROCESS RE ENGINEERING AND IMPROVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY OF JUST ONE EXAMPLE WE'VE TAKEN OUR OFFERING COMPROMISE PROGRAM. UP FROM A NINE MONTH PROCESS ALREADY DOWN TO ONE MONTH PROCESS AND AND THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE IN VARIOUS ITEMS. WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY A LET ME TURN TO THE CROSS? ISSUE NOW WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF BOTH THE ISSUES ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THE NEW SYSTEM IT ALSO IS AT THE HEART OF THE CALL CENTER ISSUES THAT THE CALL WAIT TIMES AND BUSY SIGNALS. AS WELL AS ITS REALLY THE HEART OF THE THE BUDGET NUMBERS THAT SENATOR GAINES BOTTOM. SUGGESTED AS WELL. ODD SO CROSS -- IS A CUSTOMIZED OFF THE SHELF SOFTWARE WHICH WAS PROCURED BY THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CSUS THE CONTRACT HOME RICHARD PRIOR TO THE HIVE CREATION OF CTF A IT IS BASED ON SOMETHING CALLED THE CHEN TAX PLATFORM WHICH IS USED BY. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES AND CITIES AROUND THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING BY EDIE DE -- THERE ARE REAL BENEFITS TO GOING -- TO A NEW MODERN PLATFORM -- THE INC ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY WILL LEAD TO US BEING BECOMING MORE NIMBLE. AND SHOULD INCREASE REVENUE OVER TIME -- THE SYSTEM AS I MENTIONED WENT LIVE JUST THREE MONTHS AGO. ARE THE SYSTEM WORKS BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT HAPPY WITH WHERE NOT IN ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT ARE. IT'S NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS BIO WE WOULD LIKE AND THE TEAM IS WORKING DILIGENTLY -- DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO MAKE CHANGES WE'VE ALREADY MADE MANY CHANGES -- WE ARE CONSTANTLY MONITORING CALL VOLUMES THAT ARE CALL CENTERS EVERY AFTERNOON WE GET A REPORT NOT ONLY OF THE CALL VOLUME WHICH INCLUDES WAIT TIMES AVERAGE CALL TIME -- BUT WE ALSO GET A REPORT OF WHAT ISSUES PEOPLE ARE HAVING AND THEN WE WORK OVERNIGHT THE TEAM WORKS OVERNIGHT. A TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THE NEXT DAY HOPEFULLY WE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THOSE. SAME PROBLEMS ONLINE OKAY SIR I'M GONNA YET LET ME LET ME JUST SAY THE SYSTEM'S WORKING BE PAT WE JUST HAD OUR BUSINESS FILING SEASON OF THE YEAR IN JULY. WE HAD MORE THAN -- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TAX RETURNS FILED ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS CAME IN -- SPA ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION PAYMENTS. ALL GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACES OF THE SYSTEM IS WORKING OUT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE. A A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY AND WORKING ON THAT OF THE CALL CENTER ISSUES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CROSS SYSTEM. THE IMPORTANTLY THE LAST TIME WE EXPERIENCED THESE CALL VOLUMES WAS NINE YEARS AGO WHEN WE INSTITUTE OUR PREVIOUS -- ONLINE SERVICE IT'S NATURAL WHEN YOU TRANSITION MILLION TAXPAYERS TO DIFFERENT SYSTEM. THAT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SOME ISSUES AND LET ME JUST ONE LAST IMPORTANT AND CLOSE WITH. A THE BUDGET ISSUE WHICH IS RAISE THE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. OF FOR THIS YEAR MORE THAN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS. DOES THE PAYMENT FOR THE VENDOR ON THE CROSS CONTRACT A WHICH AGAIN WAS WOULD BE DO. WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS CDT FAA OR NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A CONTRACT LET. BY BE A WE TOM I AM. I WOULD LOVE I WOULD WELCOME ANY SORT OF FREE ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO OUR COLLECT TAXES MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WELCOME ANY ADVICE. I WOULD PREFER IT MAYBE AFTER WE'VE HAD THE SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR YEAR SOMETHING TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME BACK IN. AND GIVE US A SOME HELP THEN I THINK IT'S WERE LITTLE EARLY AND WERE STILL STABILIZING SYSTEM AND AND THAT. TRYING TO MAKE OUR OWN IMPROVEMENTS INTERNALLY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MARK I'VE WON THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS. AND I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY I WILL TRUNCATE MY RECOUNT MY COMMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME -- BOTTOM LINE -- WE HAVE BEEN VERY I HELPED A LOT BY INPUT FROM STAKE HOLDERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE TAX AGENCIES OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROCESS OF OUR TWO HUNDRED SOME DAYS OF EXISTENCE WHICH ARM. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AT OTA AND I WANT TO THANK THEM IS ALSO TWO HUNDRED WORKING TO HIS -- LET ME SAY I THINK THE AUDIT IS GENERALLY GOOD IDEA I THINK IT'S NOW IS NOT THE TIME IT'S RATHER PREMATURE WE I THINK HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT -- OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS AND PUTTING INTO PLACE OFFICES A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS CAME UNDER BUDGET I MIGHT ADD -- ELIMINATING THE BACKLOG -- WHICH THE SEVERAL HUNDRED THAT WAS INHERITED -- INCORPORATING A SYSTEM OF SOME TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES FIFTEEN HUNDRED WATCHER ACTIVE -- HIRING MOST OF OUR STAFF. INCLUDING WELL QUALIFIED AND PROFESSIONAL -- ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND WE HAVE. PUT FORTH OUR REGULATIONS HAD TO IBM'S INTERESTED PARTIES MEETINGS ON THOSE REGULATIONS WITH THE THIRD SCHEDULED. WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE PROCEDURES TO SEPARATE OTA FROM THE TAX AGENCIES WITH NO CONTACT WITH A ATTORNEYS LEGAL STAFF BUT MERELY FOR PROCESSING PURPOSES. WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS TO GUARANTEE THE INDEPENDENCE OF ALJ PANELS -- BECAUSE THEY A THREE MEMBER PANEL ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE THE DECISION THAT DECISION IS FINAL -- THE DIRECTOR AND ANYONE ELSE DOES NOT SEE THAT UNTIL IT'S FINE -- AND WE'VE ESTABLISH INFORMATION SECURITY PROTOCOLS I WANTED TO WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT DRESS. VERY SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE POINTS THAT CENTER GAINES RAISED -- ON PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS OBVIO WE PRECEDENTS CONTINUE TO BE PRESIDENTIAL -- AND LASTS A CASE COMES BEFORE OTA WHICH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THAT POINT. AND IT COULD BE OVERRULED IF THE PANEL AT OTA BELIEVES IT ISN'T NOT A MATTER OF LAW. OR IS SIMPLY INCORRECT -- THAT'S PUT FORTH IN SECTION THREE OF FOR A FOR REGULATIONS -- I ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF THE DIRECTOR LEVEL FROM DECISION MAKING -- THE SEPARATION FROM TAXING AUTHORITIES THE CASE BACKLOG THE TWELVE HUNDRED CASE BACKLOG APPEARS TO STEM FROM A LA O. REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS NOT A BACKLOG OR WAS NOT A BACKLOG PER SE OF IT RATHER CASES. THAT WERE SIMPLY INHERITED FROM BE IT WE AND SENT TO OTA. ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG AT THIS POINT -- I THINK THAT -- THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ARE QUESTIONS CONCERNS ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS WERE VERY MUCH. I WILL BE IF NOT THE FIRST ONE OF THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT WERE VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE THE THE PROCESS WITH THE TAXING AGENCIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE OFFICE OF OTA. WE CAN STILL MAKE THIS WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK FOR TAXPAYERS -- WITH A MINIMUM OF OF VAN LARA ISSUES AND PROBLEMS AND AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BEFORE I OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE I I HAVE A QUICK GOOD -- GENERAL QUESTIONS TO THE AUDITOR WHICH IS THAT I I I I KNOW THAT -- YOU WERE -- DON'T TAKE POSITIONS ON AUDIT REQUESTS BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER -- HOW HELPFUL IS IT TO HAVE? A RECORD. OF SOME PERIOD OF TIME -- OF OPERATION TO AUDIT BEFORE YOU THINK. THE AUTHOR THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE. APPRECIATE THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN AS YOU AS YOU DID INDICATE WE DON'T TAKE A POSITION ON AUDIT REQUESTS BUT TYPICALLY WOULD WORK ON GOING TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. OR HOPEFULLY THAT THERE'S ENOUGH BODY OF WORK THAT WE CAN DO A FULL -- ROBUST ASSESSMENT -- CERTAINLY THESE AGENCIES AS THEY INDICATED HAVE RECENTLY BEEN CREATED I KNOW THERE WAS A THAT YOU KNOW WE SITUATION SBB WAS IN THERE FINANCE WAS IN THERE ETCETERA SO -- WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THEIR RESPONSES -- TO THE AUDITS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT CERTAINLY -- TYPICALLY WHEN WE'RE GONNA CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF ENTITIES WE WANT TO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME OR THEIR ABILITY TO PUT REGULATIONS TOGETHER POLICIES THAT CENTER BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEE -- TYPICALLY WANT TO SEE CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH POLICIES REGULATIONS IT CETERA -- WITH THAT SAID THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE GO IN EARLY -- IN LOOK AT AN ENTITY AS IT'S BEING CREATED IN ITS DEVELOPMENT-- BUT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OP PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE WAS A LOT OF THE A CONTROVERSY WITH B. O. WE AND AND AS I INDICATED AND THAT REPRESENTATIVES SPV WAS IN THEIR FINANCE WAS IN THERE KELLY CHAR WAS IN THERE -- WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TO SEE WHAT REACTION OR WHAT ON THE TWO ENTITIES HAVE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE. THOSE AUDITS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES PRACTICES THAT CENTER. THANKS VERY MUCH SARAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK IS MY COLLEAGUES KNOW ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE I IF PROBLEMS FIRST LET ME SAY I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR OF THIS REQUEST. VERY DILIGENT HARD WORKING WELL INTENTIONED. A SUPERB SENATOR -- DOES A GREAT JOB HERE -- I'VE PROBABLY SPENT AS MUCH TIME ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST. TO CERTAINLY TWO YEARS IS JUST ABOUT ANYBODY -- BUT ANYBODY I HAVE SOME COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY WHO HAVE SPENT. CERTAINLY AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME IF NOT MORE. BUT LET ME SAY THIS I MEAN WITHOUT REAL LITIGATING THE RE ARGUING THE THE ENTIRE REORGANIZATION BO WE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS. I JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE AUDIT REQUEST ITSELF I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THE SCOPE. CERTAIN OF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN DRAFTED -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS AND IF WE'RE SAYING YOU KICK THAT -- AN AGENCY OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PARTICULAR OPERATION CAN'T REEVALUATE. CRIER DECISIONS ARE PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE WAY THE LAW WORKS. THAT IS DONE ALL THE TIME THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PERIODICALLY REVIEWS PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS AND DECIDES TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES ASSIGNED TO THE OFFICE TAX APPEAL YOU KNOW OUR LEGISLATION REQUIRED THESE INDIVIDUALS BE EXPERIENCED IN THE AREA TAX. AND UNFORTUNATELY OR FORTUNATELY ONE OF THE WAYS THAT ATTORNEYS GAIN EXPERIENCE IS TO WORK FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHETHER YOU WORK FOR THE INTERESTING NEWS SERVICE FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OR SOME OTHER. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SO TO SAY THAT IT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. IS SOMEHOW BIASED OR PREJUDICED BECAUSE THEY GAINED EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER AGENCY I THINK IS. CERTAINLY MISDIRECTED AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THAT PARTICULAR AUDIT QUESTION. IT'S PHRASED WITH RESPECT TO CONFLICTS I'M NOT SURE HOW THE CONFLICT WOULD ARISE ARE WE SAYING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES DUAL EMPLOYED THAT THEY WORK AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AS THEY DO. WORK FOR THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AWAY THAT. I COULD SEE A CONFLICT AND BEYOND THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THAT BUT HAVING SAID ALL THAT I GUESS MY BASIC. CONCERN HERE IS OF THE TIMING OF THE ON IT. NO WE ALLOWED THE FORTY OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MANY DECADES ESTABLISHING THE BOARDS PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES AND METHODS OF OPERATIONS -- BEFORE WE TOOK. THE OPPORTUNITY OUR SELVES TO REVIEW THE BOARD'S AS SUCCESSES IN THE BOARD'S FAILURES AND ULTIMATELY. DECIDE THAT A REORGANIZATION WAS APPROPRIATE AND IN THIS CASE WHERE THESE -- TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ONLY BEEN -- IN EXISTENCE FOR TWELVE MONTHS OR IN THE CASE OF AN OPERATION IN THE CASE OF THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS. A SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A BIT. PREMATURE O SEND THE STATE AUDITOR IN THERE TOO A TAKE A LOOK AT OPERATIONS AND SIMPLY TELL THE INDIVIDUALS RUNNING THESE ORGANIZATIONS. PROBABLY WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOWS THAT THEIR OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORTS ARE NOT COMPLETE. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I'M SURE THAT BOTH THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS IN THE DEPARTMENT AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. HAVE -- IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIC PLANS A TIME LINE UP AT WHICH OR BY WHICH THEY INTEND TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN FULLY ORGANIZED AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THE KINKS IRONED OUT. AND WHETHER IT'S TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS I CERTAINLY THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED FULLY -- IN THE ORGANIZATION TO BE FULLY. BEFORE WE WE SEND THE STATE AUDITOR IN THERE I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF AN AUDIT REQUEST I BELIEVE DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S PHRASED IN THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE EXAMINED. AT THE END OF THAT STRATEGIC PLAN THAT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHETHER IT'S TWO OR THREE YEARS. DECEPTIVE TO DO A CHECK TO SEE HOW THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS IS PROCESSING CASES TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S A BACKLOG TO SEE WHETHER. IT SIMMERS ARRABAL TO CONTACT THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE. THE OFFICE OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO I'M HAVING SAID THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AUDIT -- BUT I WOULD I COMMIT TO OF THE WORK THE AUTHOR WHOSE REQUESTED THE AUDIT THAT -- AT THE END OF THAT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN I AM CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT I'M STILL HERE -- WHO KNOWS IT'S POLITICS -- I WILL I WILL REVISIT THE ISSUE IN WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I REQUEST AT THAT TIME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] CENTER FULLER [inaudible] SO -- IF YOU'VE MADE SEVERAL DECISIONS NOW THERE'S ME IS OPINIONS OF COME AND UP. IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT THAT ALL OF THIS THAT APPEALS THAT YOU HAVE CONSIDERED SO FAR HAVE BEEN FOUND IN FAVOR OF THE HAD TAX AGENCY RATHER THAN THE TAXPAYER. LET ME LET ME. THANK YOU CENTER FOR THAT QUESTION LET ME PUT SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THAT OF THE CASES THAT ARE NOW POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE HAVE SOME. STEVE SEVENTY I BELIEVE OUR THERE'S A THERE'S A COUPLE CASES THAT ARE IN FAVOR THE TAXPAYER -- THERE ARE MORE COMING LIKELY IN THE NEXT TRUNKS BECAUSE THAT CASES THAT WE STARTED OUT WITH -- WERE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BREAD AND BUTTER CASES THEY INVOLVE PENALTY CASES WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GRAY AREA IN THESE CASES OR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD CASES WHERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE A DECISION THAT CATEGORICALLY YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD OR YOU'RE NOT -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE DISCRETION SOME OF THESE CASES ARE QUITE -- SYMPATHETIC WE DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ACT ON THAT WE ARE A LJ IS ACT AS A MATTER OF LAW IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS -- I SUSPECT THAT -- WELL I DON'T SUSPECT I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE CASES THEY'RE COMING DOWN THE LINE SOME OF THE MUCH MORE COMPLEX CASES WHERE THERE OF OF REASONABLE POINTS OF VIEW ON ON EITHER SIDE FOR EXAMPLE A TAX CREDITS ARE INDEED CREDITS THINGS LIKE THAT -- WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE SOME DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND A SENSE AND SO FORTH I'D ALSO ADD THAT DURING THE PROCESS OF THE APPEALS WHEAT WE THE ALJ IS TOGETHER WHERE OUR STAFF ATTORNEYS HOLD PRE HEARING CONFERENCES. AND MANY OF THOSE CONFERENCES ISSUES COME TO LIGHT. BY EITHER THE TAX AGENCY OR THE TAXPAYER AND THE TAXATION SHE HAS WITHDRAWN -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SAID A SUITABLE. SO I'VE SEEN I APPRECIATE IT BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR LIKE LONGTIME WAS THAT WAS GO SO I JUST REALLY THAT WHAT'S THE RECORD OF TAX PAYERS APPEALS GRANTED VERSES [inaudible] NOT GRANTED. OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE SO FAR IS YOUR BEST ESTIMATE -- YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD PREFER TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION AND THE REASON. I AS WELL AS SPEAKS SO THAT'S FINE -- SO IS IT NOT. THAT THERE ARE NO TAX PAYER APPEALS THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED. IT IS TRUE THAT THERE AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE POSTED RIGHT NOW THERE IS A DECISION THAT WENT IN FAVOR THE TAXPAYER WITH RESPECT TO A PETITION FOR REHEARING OF A CASE. THE OTHERS I BELIEVE ARE IN FAVOR OF THE TAX AGENTS. I THINK THERE [inaudible] THAT. THAT'S NORMAL ALL I'M GOOD GALA NEED IS A SNAPSHOT FOR ME TO DECIDE. AND AT THIS POINT A PROBABLY MAKING THE MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THERE'S SOME -- POSSIBILITY THAT THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BUT I DON'T I AGREE THAT YOU HAVE RATIONAL ARGUMENTS IT SOUND LIKE IT'S PROBABLY. GOING TO CHANGE THE RECORD IN THE FUTURE. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CASES THAT ARE COMING BUT IT'S JUST NOT HERE FOR US TO SEE TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS BAKER. THANK YOU THAT ALSO PEAKED MY INTEREST AS WELL AND I HEARD THAT BUT I I WANNA GO BACK TO YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT. BACKLOG IN THAT THERE ISN'T. ONE AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND IS WHAT SOME CLARIFICATION YOU MENTION THAT THE CASES THAT CAME BACK CAME TO YOU WERE ONES THAT EXISTED BEFORE -- IS IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY CHAU DO YOU. BUT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY CAME FROM DO YOU HAVE A BACKLOG. MAYBE THEY WERE THE ONES YOU'VE CAUSED OR HAPPENED WHERE YOUR EXISTENCE BUT IS THERE THERE'S A BACKLOG. THERE IS NOT A BACKLOG. A TWELVE HUNDRED CASES WHERE THE CASES THAT WE INHERITED FROM BE A WEEK IN THE TRANSITION THERE WERE CASES IN PROCESS. OTA TOOK THEM OVER. THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF A COUPLE OF SEVERAL. I I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS AND IT WAS A FEW -- HUNDRED THREE FOUR HUNDRED OF CASES THAT NEEDED TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AS THE TAXPAYER HAD FILED AN APPEAL AND IT HAD NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED YET I SUSPECT THAT IS BECAUSE OF SOME CONFUSION THE TRANSITION. ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS A BACKLOG IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE TAXPAYER. THOSE A BIDDING KNOWLEDGE AND THEY ARE IN OUR SYSTEM THEY ARE PART OF THAT. FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASE THAT I MENTION. NOW HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE APPEALS THEN -- BEER WE AT THIS POINT. SO -- WE ARE WE ARE KATA WE'RE CAUGHT UP BUT INITIALLY WE EXPECTED. APPEALS ON THE ORDER OF SAY A HUNDRED TWENTY A MONTH WE'RE GETTING MORE LIKE A HUNDRED THIRTY HUNDRED FORTY SO IT'S POSSIBLE WE NEED. TO REASSESS OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP UP WITH THE WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS AND RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER. MAY MAYBE I'M -- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR CONSIDERING THE BACKLOG IS IT THAT IN SEMI DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE. AND THAT YOU TOOK CARE OF THAT BECAUSE I GOT A RESPONSE OR IS IT JUST YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CASE LOAD WASN'T MUCH COURSE EVER. EVER CASELOAD BUT THEN THERE SOME THAT OURS ARE OLD. AND I SO WHAT WOULD IT WOULD DO WELL YOU SAY WE HAVE NO BACKLOG WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A BACKLOG IF. WE GOT A HUNDRED TWENTY CASES AND IN A MONTH AND WE ONLY WORK THROUGH ONE HUNDRED OF THEM. WE GOT TWENTY CASES THAT ARE DELAYED AND IS THAT TWENTY EACH MONTH ACCUMULATES THAT BECOMES A BACKLOG THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. OKAY AND HAVE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW YOUR RATE OF DEALING WITH THOSE CASES IS COMPARED TO WHEN BE A WE WAS THE ENTITY. BECAUSE JUST BIT HOW YOU COMPARE FOR ME IF THERE IS A BACKLOG AND THEY'RE SOMETHING THAT ALREADY AT THIS EARLY STAGE IS A CONCERN. WE'RE WATCHING THAT VERY CAREFULLY YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SAM. WE HAVE A LIMITED. HISTORICAL RECORD AT THIS POINT -- I I THINK GIVEN OUR CURRENT RESOURCES WE CAN KEEP ON WE CAN KEEP ON TRACK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE RIGHT NOW BUT WE NEED TO WATCH IT VERY CAREFULLY -- IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE BILL WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF HOW LONG IT EXISTED AND SAID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF JUST WHAT. EVEN IN YOUR SHORT TIME PERIOD WITH THE CASES. BUT YOU HAVE THAT COMPARED TO WHAT BILLY WAS DOING DO YOU KNOW THAT THE THE LIKE THE TIME THE TEXT OF THE CASE TAKES TO GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS OR ARE HOW HOW QUICKLY SOME RATE OF SOME POINT OF COMPARISON BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT. WERE STRUCK OUT IN MY MIND IS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT IF WE ARE OF MADE THIS TRANSITION OVER. IT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF HOW IT ALL CAME TO BE BUT WHAT IF IF I'M. IF WE ARE NOW SEEN A POSSIBILITY THAT TAXPAYERS WILL NOT BE SERVED UP BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY LONG BACKLOG. DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME HOW LONG IT IS JUST AS ARE PEOPLE DOING THEIR WORK AS DILIGENTLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND WE WILL YOUR EXISTENCE IS A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. THE DELAY WAS LONGER SO SHOULD HAVE SOME POINT OF REFERENCE -- IF IF IF A TAXPAYER GOES THROUGH THE THROUGH THE REGULAR PROCESS OF THE APPEAL PROCESS THAT IS IT DOESN'T THERE'S NO EXCEPTIONS IT WASN'T TAKEN OUT FOR SETTLEMENT THEN CAME BACK AND IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS WE EXPECT THE PROCESS. ONCE WE ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT TO BE SHORTER THAN IT TAKES ON OF THE BE AWAY AND I WOULD I WOULD ADD. THAT WITH EVERY CASE THAT COMES TO O. T. A THERE IS A WRITTEN OPINION THAT'S POSTED THAT GOES TO THE TAXPAYER. SOME OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THEN IS FOR THE JUDGES DON'T MAKE DECISIONS OF THESE CASES ON THE SPOT SHIRT GO BACK TO TAKE THIRTY DAYS IN THE ISSUE THE OPINION SOME ISN'T JUST HOW IT COMPARES TO BE AWAY ITSELF LIKE MAYBE NOT. THERE IS THERE ISN'T THERE AT DIFFERENT HOUSES THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROCESS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEEING THEIR FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. ON THIS ITEM SEEING NONE -- SENATOR BEFORE I GIVING OPPORTUNITY CLOSE I S. WANTED. SHARE MY THOUGHTS IN AYE I THINK. WE GENERALLY. WELL FIRST OF ALL WE CAN CERTAINLY RESPECT YOUR WE ARE STRONG PERSONAL INTEREST IN -- AND THE EN IN THE SUBJECT MATTER AND WE THE HOME. APPRECIATE YOUR A REQUEST HERE AYE ME BUT I I I FEEL THAT -- THAT -- IN A WHILE WE GENERALLY SUPPORT AUDIT REQUESTS FROM. OUR FELLOW LEGISLATORS HERE ODD THAT THIS. ONE IF IF THERE'S A CASE FOR AYE I REQUEST TO BE PREMATURE THAT SEEMS TO BE. ONE OF WHERE WE HAVE -- A NEW HOW NEW AGENCIES -- AS AS THE OPPOSITE TAX APPEALS INDICATED THEY'VE ONLY HAD TWO UNDER WORKING DAYS -- THE THE ONLINE SYSTEMS BEEN ON ONLY FOR THREE MONTHS AND AS THE BAD STATE AUDITOR. AHA INDICATOR WHILE SHE'S NOT TAKING  POSITION ON THIS REQUEST THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING. THEY WOULD LIKE SOMETIME SOON IN A TO A BODY OF EVIDENCE TO TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A OF A OF AN AGENCY AND AND AND AND SOME. BODY OF WORK LOW TO REVIEW AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT YET AND SO. OUR I AM RECOMMENDING GO -- A DENIAL OF THIS REQUEST BUT WHY GIVE THE LAST WORD YET GREAT THANK YOU. SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE THIS PRESENTATION -- I HAVE TURNS -- WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED. SOME OF WHICH HAVE COME FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. SOME OF WHICH HAVE WORKED ON CASES. REPRESENTING THE STATE AND THE STATE HAS CERTAIN VIEW ON THOSE CASES. SO I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING. WHERE THEIR APPOINTEES THAT HAVE SERVED? AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WITH THE OTA. THAT HAVE MADE DECISIONS ON CASES THAT THEY ALREADY WORKED ON BOB NUMBER -- TWO THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD BY THE OTA EVOLVE IN INCOME TAX APPEALS. SO WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE WANTED TO BRING THEIR SALES AND USE TAX ISSUES FORWARD. FOR WHICH THERE ARE PENALTIES THAT ARE RUNNING. AND HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD. FOR MONTHS ON END [inaudible] SO -- AS A RESULT OF THE PRIORITY. OF THE OTA -- WILL THOSE PEOPLE NOT BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL PENALTIES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN. WAITING AT THE BACK OF THE LINE AND NOT HURT THEIR CASES HER NOT HAVE THEIR HEAD OF CASES HURTS UP. UNDER THE VIA E. THOSE -- DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THOSE CASES WERE -- WOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN UP THROUGH THE MEETING PROCESS. SO THOSE OUR ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT I HAVE THAT I THINK -- YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIED TO MOVE FORWARD -- WITHIN AUDIT THAT -- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT -- JUST I I'VE GOT CONCERNED AS TO WHETHER. YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES THAT ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT. AND THEN WHY THE PRIORITY FOR INCOME TAX. VERSES INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A SALES HER VALUES TAX ISSUE THAT -- FOR WHICH PENALTIES ARE CONTINUING ON A DAILY BASIS -- INCREASING. AND THEN FINALLY AND SOME OF THESE CASES YOU'VE HAD THE OUR AHEAD AND GRANT -- FLEXIBILITY I WAS READING -- ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR WHERE THERE IS ADAPT THE DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER. AND THE IRS GRANTED ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE DOCUMENTATION AND THE PAYMENT TO BE MADE. AND THAT WAS DENIED BY THE DOD. SO -- I'M SHE'S MAY NOT BY THE DOD THE OTA SO MY HOPE WOULD BE. THAT. THERE WOULD BE -- SOME GRACE ON THE PART OF OCHIAI. HAD THESE -- AS THESE CASES MOVE FORWARD WE'RE DEALING WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. BUT OFTEN ARE NOT SOPHISTICATED. AND NOT FAMILIAR WITH -- THE LAW. AND THEY'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THINGS AND IN SOME CASES ASIA SHUTTING BUSINESS AND THE BEER WE HAD THAT ABILITY -- AND I'M NOT SEEING IT -- EXPRESSED YET BY THE OTA AND SO -- MAYBE THAT WOULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. BUT I WOULD I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE TO MOVE FOR WITH THE AUDIT I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH CONCERN HERE -- THAT WE OUGHT TO MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THAT. THERE'S COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY OR AND WE LOOK AT THE ACT IT'S CALLED THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY. AND FAIRNESS ACCESO. HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT. AND OUR PEOPLE BEING TREATED FAIRLY AND I'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF BOTH. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THE CASE OF THE TITLE OF THE ACT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. MOTIONS DEMAND IS OUR SECOND. SECOND -- MADAM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ROLL CALL INTO PROOF AUDIT REQUEST NUMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CASH ONCE HE FIVE THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY IN FAIRNESS ACT FROM CENTER GAINES. CHAIRS RECOMMENDATIONS THE NO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WERE SUCI. PURSUE CHINO ACOSTA. ACOSTA AYE BAKER. BAKER I NAZARIAN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] RUBIO. RUBIO NO WAY [inaudible] SEATOR ROBB [inaudible] ROTH NO [inaudible] ALLEN [inaudible] BELL [inaudible] CANNELLA ALERT [inaudible] FULLER I LARA. I WRITE THAT REQUEST IS ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF NO OKAY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY -- NON COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENTING SO MS RUBIO WHICH I LIKE. TO THIS IS ITEM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE TWENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WORK RELATED INJURIES. AUDIT REQUESTS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR ITEMS LAGGED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A SIMPLE AUDIT. WHICH SEEKS TO GAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING HOW EFFICIENT OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS WORKING. THIS AUDIT WILL PROVIDE INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED UNVERIFIED INFORMATION RELATED TO WORK RELATED INJURIES INCURRED BY BOTH EMPLOYEES AND INMATES WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I'M IT TOTALLY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT INDEPENDENT DATA WHICH CAN GUIDE POLICYMAKERS. BY COMPARING THE TIME LINES OF MEDICAL TREATMENT PROVIDED TO CDC ARE EMPLOYEES AND INMATES. THE ARTICLE CHAU REASONS FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WHICH CAN GUIDE FUTURE POLICY DISCUSSIONS. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JASON MARKETS PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA APPLICANT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION TO HELP ANTI ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST I RESPECTFULLY ASK [inaudible] FOR A GOOD. I GUESS AND YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN BE MEMBERS -- AS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID MY NAME IS JASON MARKETS ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OR ORGANIZATION OF LAWYERS THAT PROBABLY REPRESENT INJURED WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AYE WE HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO'S I REQUEST. BUT WHAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION REFORM BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED IN ENACTED BY THE GOVERNOR BROWN OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR INJURED WORKERS. AND IT RESULTED IN LOWER INSURANCE COSTS TO EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS RECORD PROFITS FOR INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COST OF THESE REFORMS HAS BEEN UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN PROVIDING MEDICAL TREATMENT TO INJURED WORKERS. I AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE NEEDS ITS OWN SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO ASSESS THE DELAYS IN PROVIDING MEDICAL TREATMENT TO INJURED WORKERS. THE SOONER THE TREATMENTS PROVIDED THE CENTER THE WORKER CAN RECOVER AND RETURN TO WORK. JUST LAST MONTH THE WORKERS COMPENSATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE RELEASED A REPORT THEY COMPARED WORKERS COMPENSATION INJURIES AND THE DELIVERY OF MEDICAL TREATMENT -- IN EIGHTEEN STATES HERE IN THE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA RANKED OF THE WORST THAT IS THE SLOWEST OUT OF ALL THE STATES WHEN IT COMES TO DAYS BETWEEN AN INJURY AND WHEN MEDICAL TREATMENT IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED TO AN INJURED WORKER. IN SHORT OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THE STATE AUDITOR WILL UNCOVER THIS SIMPLE FACT THE CALIFORNIA'S INJURED WORKERS ARE FACING UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS. IN RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON THE I REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER YOU KNOW OKAY. HAZARDS OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OVER TRICKLE REPRESENTING COMFORT UP CLINTON'S TECHNICIAN THANK YOU. STATE ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO INDICATED THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AUDIT DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS. A DISCUSSED WHERE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT CCR HAS FOR RESPONDING TO AN PROVIDING TREATMENT. TO NOT ONLY INJURED EMPLOYEES BUT INMATES WHO WORK IN THE FACILITY SO INMATE WORK RELATED OUR INJURIES SO LOOKING AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THEN. ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOME ANALYSIS OF THAT WE OBTAIN A AND AGAIN WE WOULD USE OUR IT FOLKS AND CERTAINLY NOT PARTNERING WITH THE AUDIT STAFF. LOOKING AT DATA THAT CCR HAS REGARDING OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AN INMATE WORK RELATED INJURIES ARE TO DETERMINE VARIOUS PHASES SO. THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INJURY THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT WHEN THAT TREATMENT WAS ACTUALLY EXCUSE ME PROVIDED. ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN THE RECOMMENDATION IF IT WAS FIRST SURGICAL INTERVENTION WHEN DID THAT SURGICAL INTERVENTION TAKE PLACE OR THE EARLY THE APPROPRIATE. A SURGICAL PROCEDURE PROVIDED TO THE D. INJURED INDIVIDUAL WHETHER IT'S A AN EMPLOYEE OR AN INMATE. WHO WAS WORKING AT A FACILITY AND HAS BEEN INJURED? ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN FIRST RECEIVING CARE AND ACTUALLY BEING RELEASED FROM CARE AND THEN THE NEXT PHASE IS REALLY LOOKING AT BEING RELEASED FROM CARE IN BEING ABLE TO RETURN BACK TO WORK. AND THEN THE FINAL OBJECTIVE DIDN'T SKEWS ME IS TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST. I APOLOGIZE -- TIMELINESS AND IDENTIFY ARE THERE ANY ANY PLACES WHERE THERE COULD BE MORE EFFICIENCIES IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEES AND THEIR INJURIES AN INMATE -- INMATES WHO ARE INJURED ON THE JOB BUT ALSO JUST LOOKING AT TIMELINESS OVERALL AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU SEE ARE COULD BE DOING OR THE SYSTEM COULD BE DOING. OUGHT TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE EFFECTIVE DAY AUDIT IS BUDGETED ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY HOURS THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE WILL WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO WORK BOTH THAT. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HEADQUARTERS. I APOLOGIZE -- AND SOME OF THE OF FACILITIES IN THE STATE. A WITHOUT MISTER CHERYL ANSWERING QUESTIONS MEMBER MAY HAVE. IRATE ENERGY -- O. BEFORE OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IT WOULD -- THE CDC ARE LIKE. TO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS EMPRESS APPLEGATE WITH DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OFFICE OF LEGISLATION AYE WERE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUDIT IF IT GETS IMPROVED THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO MENTION SPECIFICALLY THAT WE HAVE GREAT WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE AS WELL. WILD ON IT IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED AT CDC ARE MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE AUDIT SEEKS IS ACTUALLY NOT HOUSE WITHIN CDC ARE. IT'S HOUSE WITHIN THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE YEAH -- AND SO THAT DIDN'T THE INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE RELATED TO THIS WOULD BE INFORMATION RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO INMATE HEALTH CARE PROVIDED FOR INMATE WORKERS -- DOT IS. THAT'S INFORMATION THAT IS CONTROLLED BY CDC ARE BUT IT IS ALSO. NOT NECESSARILY AN APPROPRIATE COMPARISON BETWEEN THAT AND EMPLOYEES UNDER TO GET YEAR BECAUSE YOU SEE OUR IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CONSTITUTIONALLY HEALTH CARE TO ITS INMATES WHEN THEY GET INJURED AND THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THAT -- THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THERE'D AIR THAT ARE AT ISSUE HERE WITH EMPLOYEES WHO GET INJURED WHILE THEIR WORK -- WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND THEY SAID THEY ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE AUDIT PROCESS AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER NOW THEY BELIEVE THEY COULD HAVE A TOGETHER WITHIN A WEEK'S ALSO JUST POINTING OUT. GIVEN THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIR EARLIER THAT THE INFORMATION ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT IT IS REQUIRED TO TO BE PROVIDED DEPARTMENT AND ON THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND WOULD BE WILLING TO PROVIDE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE OUT OF THAT AS WELL. RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE BUTTON. SEEING NONE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. PLEASE COME FORTH. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VICTORIA HASSEY IT IN ON THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WE OVERSEE THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. WE ALSO HOUSE THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION WHICH IS A BODY THAT IS CHARGED WITH STUDYING. ALL THINGS WITHIN SYSTEM AND COULD EASILY HANDLE THIS REQUEST -- AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS REQUEST BE REDIRECTED TO THE BODIES WE THINK IT IS THE MORE APPROPRIATE FORUM FOR SUCH A STUDY. AND THINK YOU [inaudible] ALRIGHT [inaudible] ANNIA. NEXT WITNESS OUR COMMENT. YES HELLO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WANTED MYERS AT REPRESENTING STATE PINE JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT STATEMENT WILL HAVE THIS DATA AVAILABLE. WITHIN A WEEK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INMATE INFORMATION AS CHRIS MENTIONED EARLIER ALRIGHT. BUT BEFORE GOING FURTHER -- DID THEY HAVE TO COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. TO AS YOU BE SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF SEEKING THE INFORMATION THAT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT I RECEIVED -- OUR EARLIER THIS WEEK WAS THAT THAT JOB IS CDC ARE WE HAVE THAT INSTALLED THE INFORMATION BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE. ALL OF IT AND SO I WOULD DEFER TO THE AUDITOR TO SEE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- IT'S BEEN FACT CORRECT BECAUSE I JUST LEANED OVER AND ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW THAT THEY WERE AND SHE DIDN'T SO. I WOULD DEFER TO THE AUDITOR TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT WE KNOW THAT OR THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE DON'T. WELL LIT WAS LIKE -- WELL WE CERTAINLY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND OUT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AUDIT THEM SO WE COULD GET ACCESS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. BASED ON THE PRESENTATION THEY'RE WILLING. TO IN WITH US NOW TO THE EXTENT CCR HAS INFORMATION WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT -- I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE WORKERS COMP I THINK IT WAS THAT I'M NOT SURE. I'D BE ASSOCIATION THAT THE% FIRST WITNESS WAS A PUBLIC WITNESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BUT I KNOW THERE IS A WORKERS COMP RESEARCH BUREAU. THAT DOES SOME ANALYSIS I DON'T KNOW STE ALL THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE ANALYSES FOR THE TYPES OF ANALYSES THAT THEY DO. CERTAINLY WE IF THEY HAVE INFORMATION -- THAT WOULD BE PERTINENT TO THE AUDIT WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION ALRIGHT STATE SO SHE WAS ARE UPSET OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND AND WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT PERHAPS -- HER AGENCY WOULD. BE OF MORE RELEVENT -- RESPONDING AGENCY. THAT TO THE ISSUES BEING RAISED THAT DID IT I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY. YES WE OVERSEE THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION OF HEALTH SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. IT HAS BEEN AROUND FIRST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT HAS MEMBERS OF APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT IS CHARGED WITH STUDYING THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM ISSUES AND ANY MEMBER CAN REQUEST. THE COMMISSION TO REVIEW TO CONSIDER STUDY TYPICALLY THEY THEN DISCUSS AMONGST THE COMMISSION MEMBERS VOTE TO APPROVE THE STUDY IN AND IS THEN -- CONDUCTED THROUGH AN OPEN VETTING PROCESS WE'VE HAD MANY STUDIES CONDUCTED BY BOTH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND RAN. WHO HAVE USE ROBUST AND PEER REVIEWED MATH -- METHODOLOGIES AND PARTLY ANALYST DOES MUCH AND AN ISSUE OF ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE THINK IT WOULD BE -- WHO COULD BACK WHO KNOWS THE SYSTEM WHILE AND COULD SAY THESE QUESTIONS AND PERHAPS RECOMMEND OTHERS THAT WOULD BE? HELPFUL FOR THE REQUEST HER CURRENT BEFORE TURN OVER TO MR ON ACOSTA MISERABLY I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT YOU WANT TO PROCEED WITH AT THE REQUEST OF HEY I IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONTRACTED WITH SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET THE RESEARCH AND I WOULD BE. MORE -- I THINK MORE COME IN FACT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THEN THE THE AMOUNT OF HOURS AT THE AUDITOR WOULD HAVE TO SPEND WOULD BE -- TO LESS OBVIOUSLY SO AGAIN I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR THE AUDITOR TO CONDUCT THAT AND AGAIN IF IF THE INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE THEN -- THE AUDITOR COULD COMPLETE THAT AND IF NOT THEN SHE WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE REQUEST. BUT OTHER MEMBERS CHAIRMAN THOUGH THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE DR WILL RUN TO SEE PROMISE GIVE. THEIR OF ACCIDENTALLY INFORMATION EITHER. HER BACK TO SCHOOL THANK YOU MISS RUBIO I MEAN DEMONSTRATE BUSTER AND HAVEN'T. I SIMILAR COMMENTS I MEAN THAT THE DEPARTMENT BUT JUST A RELATIONS KEPT REFERRING TO A STUDY THIS IS NOT A STUDY THIS IS AN AUDIT RIGHT NOW. PERFORMED BY AN OUTSIDE AGENCY THAT THE PURPOSE OF AN AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR IS THAT. ALL ASPECTS CAN BE LOOKED AT AND DELVED INTO THEY HAVE STATUTORY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO GO INTO AREAS THAT YOU KNOW THE YOU SEE -- WHO HER RESEARCHER MAY OR MAY NOT OF ALL RESPECT FOR YOU SEE SYSTEMS THAT A FABULOUS JOB LET'S BRING THEM ON YOU KNOW? ONLINE AS WELL BUT WE HAVE A A PROCESS BY WHICH THE LEGISLATURE WORKS IN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TO THE UP. THROUGH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO REALLY GET INTO THESE -- THESE ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE -- FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S DO THIS WORK RATHER THAN THAT PART DOES RELATIONS THANK YOU ALRIGHT BANG AND I WOULD ALLMOVIE OUT IT JUST MEANS.

THANK YOU -- WE DO NOT SEE ANY -- PRESENTERS -- IN THE ROOM -- MR GRAY AND MR BONTA IF YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR REQUEST TO BE. A CONSERVE PLEASE COME -- TO THE COMMITTEE HEARING -- WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDED HIGH RISK LOCAL AUDIT FOR THE CITY OF THAT WAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- KNITWEAR BACK AYE AS YOU FARM SURE RECALL WE REQUESTED. APPROVAL OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE CITY OF ATWATER AFTER WE HAD IT COMPLETED INITIAL ASSESSMENT AT THAT HEARING IT WAS DECIDED THAT. ATWATER WOULD PROVIDE US ADDITIONAL AND AND THEN WE WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER TO COME BACK WE HAVE RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION FROM THE CITY OF ATWATER -- AND WE STILL HAVE SUFFICIENT CONCERNS ARE WE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME STEPS. OUGHT TO MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE CITY BUT THERE WERE A VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED -- TO THEY'VE RUN A GENERAL FUND DEFICIT FOR TEN OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS OTHER FISCAL YEAR THEIR THEIR BUDGET FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR DOESN'T COMPLETELY ELIMINATE. THE DEFICIT. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR PLANS UP OVER A LONGER TERM LONG TERM FORECASTING AND WE DON'T REALLY SEE A FORMAL PLAN MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO KEEP THEMSELVES OUT FROM. RUNNING A DEFICIT IN THE GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CITY ARM AND AND THAT HAS A AN ADDITIONAL AFFECTED THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IDENTIFY PROBLEMS BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHERE THE CITY WAS -- USING FUNDS FROM OTHER -- UTILITY FUNDS ETCETERA TO SHORE UP THE GENERAL FUND DEFICIT -- THEY HAVE THE STEP THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT'S APPROPRIATE IS THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED LOANS NOW WHERE THESE THEY GENERAL FUND OWES THESE UTILITY FUNDS -- LIKE SEWER FUND ETCETERA A ALONE SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY PROPERLY RECORDED IT FROM AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE NOW BUT THEY STILL HAVE THAT THAT CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO DEFICITS. LIKE MY A MANY MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY DO HAVE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO RISING PENSION COSTS AND OPARE AB UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. WE HAD IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT TURNOVER AND HAVING THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS IN THE RIGHT CLASSIFICATIONS AS FAR AS HAVING A PRESS CITY MANAGER. THEY HAVE AN INTERIM CITY MANAGER THEY DID TALK DECIDED TO CONTINUE THAT PERSONS -- INTERIM STATUS SO AND THEY HAVE SOME OTHER INTERIM POSITIONS -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR -- POLICE CHIEF WAS PUT ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE THEY'RE CONDUCTING A AN INVESTIGATION RELATED TO THAT AND SOME OTHER REVIEWS -- SO WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT AND LOOKING AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S -- REPORT THE CONCERNS THEY HAD RELATED TO INTERNAL CONTROLS ACCOUNTING CONTROLS -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US MUCH PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- I DO HAVE A LIST OF SOME OF THE ITEMS THE CITY GAVE TO US ON MY STAFF WENT THROUGH ONE WAS WE'VE REFERRED TO AS A PATH FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY AND MYSELF LOOKING AT IT SAID. IT'S NOT REALLY A PLAN OR A PATH IT IS IDEAS OF SUGGESTIONS FOR THINGS THEY COULD DO SO WE REALLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE CITY WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT THEY'VE TAKEN. BUT WE STILL THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE -- FOR STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE GET IN THEIR CONDUCT SOME ANALYSIS AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WHEN WE AUDITED MAY WOULDN'T AND THE CITY OF HIM IT -- AS FAR AS SOME. FINANCIAL EXPERTISE I HAVE FINANCIAL EXPERTS IN MY OFFICE THAT CAN GET INTO THIS CITY AND HOPEFULLY TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THINGS AND REALLY -- GIVE THE CITY SOME OF FEEDBACK ON THINGS THAT THEY INTEND TO DO THEIR THINKING ABOUT DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS SO -- WITHOUT MISTER CHAIR I KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE A LONG LONG TIME -- THE BUDGET IS ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS NOW THAT IS FROM START TO FINISH THAT'S OUR PROCESSING TIME SO WE WOULD BE OUT AT THE CITY FOR JUST A FEW WEEKS PROBABLY TWO TO THREE WEEKS CONDUCTING FIELDWORK -- BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THESE SMALL ENTITIES ARE SENSITIVE TO STATE AUDITOR'S COMING OUT AND BEING ON SITE FOR MONTHS ON END THAT IS NOT THE INTENT HERE THIS AUDIT. FROM START TO FINISH WILL TAKE US. BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR MONTHS PUBLIC CLOSE TO FOUR MONTHS BUT US BEING OUT IN THE FIELD IS ONLY GONNA BE A MATTER OF WEEKS. ARE WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK OUR RIGHT -- BEFORE WE OPEN UP TO ANY QUESTIONS LET'S GIVE A OPPORTUNITY -- FOR THE CITY THAT WATER PLEASE COME FORWARD. THEY WANT TO SIT NEXT TO HOPE THAT I WANT THINGS ARE I'M JUST KIDDING I WANT AND I DON'T. MANAGER NO WORRIES ME HERE NO WORRIES. YEAH THERE ARE YOU KNOW HOW LAURIE WATERMAN IN FROM CITY MANAGER FOR CITY ABOUT WATER WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. A AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. I'M GONNA MISS KENDALL FLOODS I'M WITH REGIONAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES WE'VE BEEN UNDER CONTRACT WITH CITY ABOUT WATER SINCE JANUARY -- IN REVIEWING V. OF AUDITOR'S A REQUEST FOR AN ON AND LOOKING AT THE SIX PROJECT AREAS WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY IN TERMS OF PRODUCING A RESPONSE. OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ASKED THE CITY TO RISK HER PROVIDE THOSE DOCUMENTS BACK IN JULY WHICH WE DID. AND THAT WAS OVER SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TARGET AREAS OVER SIX HUNDRED PAGES OF DOCUMENTS AND AS BEST WE CAN TELL I BELIEVE THAT THE THE AUDITOR'S ACTUALLY. TRYING TO DO THE BEST HOPE IN JUST BELIEVE THAT THE PERHAPS COULD BE MORE TIME SPENT. IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE CITY TO DETERMINE DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY WERE SUBMITTED WERE NOT EITHER UP TO SNUFF MORE WERE LACKING IN CLARITY FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL. OF THE CITY HAS DONE A GREAT JOB THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS OF REALLY DOING A HUGE TURNAROUND THEY'VE ADOPTED THEIR FIRST BALLOTS BUDGET BY UNANIMOUS A THREE HE HAD HIS RESOLUTION. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE OVERHAULED THEIR MASTER FEE SCHEDULE THEY'VE NOW MOVE FOR WITH TO EIGHTEEN COMPLIANCE FOR WATER AND SEWER THEY PUT IN PLACE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WOULD PREVENT. THE ERRORS OF THE PAST WHICH FRANKLY WERE BAD ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES THEY WERE UTILIZING OR ACCESSING SOME OF THEIR ENTERPRISE FUNDS AND MOVING THEM INTO GENERAL FUND THOSE HAVE ALL BEEN RECTIFIED. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSE WIH THEM TO COME UP THE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN COURSE IMPLEMENTING THOSE PRACTICES THROUGH A POLICY ADOPTION AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL. WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CITY AND THE TAXPAYERS TO MOVE FOR WITH A MONITORING PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO A FULL AUDIT. VERY SIMILAR TO THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT THE AUDITOR HAS REVIEWED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE BEEN THIRTEEN CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR HIGH RISK AUDIT. NINE IF OF HAVE MOVED OVER TO THE MONITORING PORTION THE PROGRAM WITH FOR MOVING TO A FULL ON IT. AT THIS POINT THE CITY HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN SOME MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO TO ATTRACT SOME NEW EMPLOYEES TO FILL SOME OF THE VACANCIES THAT THE AUDITOR HAS IDENTIFIED. WE BELIEVE THAT AN AUDIT AT THIS TIME COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CITY'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND ALSO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALITY EMPLOYEES. SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A PASS HERE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT WE WOULD VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR IN A MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE MANNER AS OPPOSED TO THE AUDIT. AND WORK WITH HER AND HER STAFF TO IDENTIFY THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THOSE PROCEDURES WHERE WE COULD YOU HAVE IMPROVEMENT OR ENHANCEMENT. IN ORDER -- TO SATISFY THE CONCERNS OF THE SIX TOPIC AREAS AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THEM WAS POLICE A SERVICES OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT. THE CITY ACTUALLY IS HAD A REDUCTION IN VIOLENT CRIME AND IN OVERALL CRIME 20% REDUCTION SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN ALL OF THE FEE STUDIES FROM PLANNING BUILDING UP. RECREATION EVEN USER FEES REVIEWED THEY'VE ALSO MOVE FORWARD TO ADOPT THE UP PREFERRED OR IT'S IT'S A SUGGESTED A LIGHTING LANDSCAPE DISTRICT FEES ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT FRANKLY LIKE MANY JURISDICTIONS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. PERHAPS ELECTED OFFICIALS PUT THEM OFF FOR A LITTLE TOO LONG BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO A BECAUSE THEIR CONSTITUENTS PAIN AND I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT AT SOME POINT. EVERY JURISDICTION IN ESPECIALLY THOSE IN FISCAL -- CHALLENGED TIMES NEED TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE DEFENSE WILL COST RECOVERY FOR THE DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES WHETHER THEY ARE FOR UTILITY SERVICES OR FOR THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THE CITY LEVEL. I'M IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL APPROACH I BELIEVE THAT WORKING CLOSELY WITH RGS OUR TEAM AND WITH THE FOLKS ON ON ON THE CITY'S A STAFF AT THIS TIME WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME BACK WITH A NO SIX TO NINE MONTHS WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR. AND PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A MORE UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WERE FARING WHAT WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SEVER CANNELLA I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE -- REPRESENTED -- THE THE CITY THAT WATER -- WELL IN IN IN AND WE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SURE SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UP FIRST OF I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE IMPACT ON THE COUNCIL OR THE CITY I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT QUITE FRANKLY AT MY COMMITMENTS TO THE RESIDENTS ABOUT WATER AND WHATEVER THE CITYHAS TO DO TO MEET THOSE COMMITMENTS ME. COULD DURING THE LAST MINUTE I ASK THAT WE HOLD ON THIS AUDIT BECAUSE I FELT THAT WATER WAS TRYING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY THEY ARE MOVING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THEY CALLED ME A FEW WEEKS AGO AND SAID LOOK WE'D LIKE YOUR OFFICIAL OPPOSITION OF THE SAGA SO WE NEED TO COME IN TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I SHOULD OPPOSE IT. AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT BUT I WILL IF YOU DON'T THAT UNDERSCORED OUT JUST LIKE I TOLD MY COLLEAGUES THAT WOULD DO A FEW MONTHS AGO. NOW WE WENT THROUGH ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING IT AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE THERE YET QUITE FRANKLY BUT I THINK THEY ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. WHO ARE OWN AUDITOR SAID THAT? OF THE FOURTEEN REQUESTS MADE WERE DOWN THE THIRTEEN NOW WE'LL SEE HOW MISTER GAINES TURNS OUT. THAT SHE COULD GET TWELVE OF THEM DONE BY NEXT FEBRUARY THAT BILLY J. LACK RECONVENES NEXT FEBRUARY. SO I WOULD ASK THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER CITIES THAT WERE LOOKED AT FOR A HIGH RISK OF BUTTON BEEN PUT INTO. THE MONITORING PROGRAM I THINK THERE WERE NINE OF THEM OF THE FOURTEEN I THINK OUT WATER -- IS ELIGIBLE FOR THAT AS WELL JUST BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK I DON'T THINK THERE'S IMPENDING DISASTER WITHOUT WATER I THINK THEY ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. AND OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DIRECT THE AUDITOR TO PUT THEM ON A LARGER PROGRAM BUT I WOULD ASK THAT WE DO THAT IF THIS AUDIT DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD TODAY. BECAUSE AGAIN MY BEST MY INTEREST. BEST INTEREST OF OF THE RESIDENTS ABOUT WATER SO I THINK THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS I THINK THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. AND THEN AND THERE STRUGGLING OF COURSE JUST LIKE ALL UP AND DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE A LOT OF STRUGGLES THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE DO NOT HAVE. BUT WE PUT THEM IN A HIGH RISK AUDIT. ROOM THEN IF THEY HAVE TO GO OUT TO BOND FOR VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS SOFT PAIR A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT A QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. I KNOW THAT IF I WERE APPLYING FOR A JOB I WOULD LOOK AT A CITY IF THEY WERE HIGH RISK I WOULD HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT IT SO. UNDERSTANDING ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE -- THE FACT THAT WE PROBABLY COULDN'T GET TO THE AUDIT UNTIL FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR ANYWAY. AT THAT TIME -- J. LACK IF IF THERE'S THEY SO DESIRE THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND AUDIT CITY THAT WATER. I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY HARM IN IN DELAYING THIS TOLD US THAT WE DO NOT MOVE FOR WITH THE AUDIT AND I WOULD ASK THAT THE AUDITOR I WOULD HUMBLY ASK THE AUDITOR TO PUT THEM ON A MONITORING PROGRAM. MILITIA SEE HOW WE DO IN THE IF IN FEBRUARY -- THEY DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS LAID OUT THEN AUDIT THEM AND AND LET'S GET. GET THINGS ON TRACK BUT I STILL THINK THAT WE'RE THERE YET SO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- AGES -- TO WANTING ASK THE COMMITTEE KEEP IN MIND AS THE AUDITOR IT'D REMIND ME THAT ORIGINALLY THIS REQUEST FROM THE AUDITOR DID COME IN JANUARY. OF OF AT THIS YEAR -- AND SO -- WE WE WE HAVE TO GET A GIVEN THE CITY OF ATWATER SOMETIME BUT JUST FOR CONSIDERATION ANY OTHER AYE AYE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS BAKER. STUFF I UNDERSTAND CREWS SOME IN. ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION THE AUDITOR'S QUESTIONS OF HAPPEN OR MATERIALS BEEN PROVIDED -- HAVE YOU. HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GO THROUGH. WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED SO FAR THIS TO MADAME MONITOR -- AND I WELCOME. I APOLOGIZE AT STEP OUT BRIEFLY BUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE IDEA. OF HAVING THEM ON A MONITOR -- PAST AT THIS TIME. M. IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON BOTH OF THOSE PLEASE. WELL WE HAVE RE REFER EXCUSE ME A LITTLE TIRED WE RECEIVED MATERIALS FROM THE CITY ARE APT AT PRIOR TO THE LAST HEARING WHEN IT WAS HER IT WAS HEARD IN MAY. WE HAD SUBMIT A REQUEST EARLIER IN THE YEAR -- BUT WAS PUT OFF UNTIL THE MAY HEARING SO AT THE MAY HEARING WHEN THE CITY APPEARED THEY HAD SENT US SOME MATERIALS ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE HEARING AND I TOLD STAFF. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION MY STAFF DID GO THROUGH THE MATERIALS. IT WASN'T AS VOLUMINOUS AT BASED ON WHAT THEY TOLD ME AS AS WHAT WAS REPRESENTED A FEW MINUTES AGO BUT THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS AND I TOLD THEM I'D YOU NEED TO ADVISE ME. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS REQUEST OR WHETHER WE DECIDE TO PULL IT MONITOR. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT STAFF DID. AND AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME STEPS. BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THEIR BABY STEPS AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK SOME OF THOSE STEPS ARE HAVE BEEN TAKEN BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE CITY OF ATWATER WE WENT OUT THERE AND CONDUCTED. AN ASSESSMENT BEFORE WHICH IS PART OF THE PROCESS BEFORE WE EVEN COME TO THE COMMITTEE. WE ABSOLUTELY CAN CONTINUE TO MONITOR THEM. BOMB IF THE AUDIT IS NOT APPROVED WE WILL DEFINITELY DO THAT AS WE MONITOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT CITIES WERE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT NON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT WERE ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A PROGRAM THAT -- HOPEFULLY WILL BE COME EVEN MORE AND MORE ROBUST. AS FAR AS MONITORING MY CONCERN AND OUR CONCERN IS WE'VE. LOOKED AT A INFORMATION BY CONDUCTING THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT. CAME TO J. LACK IN JANUARY WAS PUT OFF TILL MAY AS MR MATTEUCCI INDICATED AT THE MAY HEARING AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SENATOR. WE TOOK THE INFORMATION THAT THE CITY GAVE TO US AND WE'RE STILL NOT CONVINCED. ACOSTA WE THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL OFF FOR US TO GET OUT THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT THEY INTEND TO PUT INTO PLACE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS. THIS APPROVING AN AUDIT REQUEST DOES NOT MAKE THE CITY OF ATWATER A HIGH RISK CITY. CONDUCTING AN AUDIT WILL WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE DECIDE TO PUT THEM OUT THERE AS A HIGH RISK CITY. THE OTHER -- RESULT OF THE AUDIT COULD BE. THE CITY HAS PUT CERTAIN POLICIES IN PLACE WE THINK THEY'RE LONG STE LONG TERM FISCAL FORECAST IS APPROPRIATE THEY'VE TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO DEAL WITH THEIR GENERAL FUND DEFICIT THERE THEY HAVE STRONGER BUDGETING PRACTICES IT CETERA. SO THE AUDIT THAT WE CONDUCT MAY RESULT IN. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CATEGORIZED AS A HIGH RISK CITY THEY HAVE ISSUES BUT THEY HAVE GOOD PLANS IN PLACE AND THEY'VE ADDRESSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THE CONTROLLER IDENTIFIED FOUR YEARS AGO. AND BASED ON OUR PROFESSIONAL THEY ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT COULD BE A POSITIVE OUTCOME OF AN AUDIT THAT THIS COMMITTEE APPROVES AT MY OFFICE WOULD CONDUCT AND MONITORING IS AN ADEQUATE FOR WHAT REASON. MONITORING WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACCESS CERTAIN MATERIALS IT WOULD BE LIMITED TO WHAT THE CITY WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE WITH US. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO GET OUT TO THE CITY AND WE COULD HOPEFULLY GO OUT AND VISIT THE CITY AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT. ANY PUBLICLY AND FOR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE WITH US. THE AUTHORITY -- ONCE THIS AUDIT IS APPROVED IF IT IS OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY AS FAR AS ACCESS TO INFORMATION. ARE WOULD BE MUCH MUCH STRONGER MEN ARE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR STRONG THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE CITY WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YES AND WHATEVER KICK AND WE GET THIS REAL SPECIFIC HAS A MINUTE. WE'RE GONNA HOLD YOU TO YOUR WORD. WHAT WHAT THE AUDITOR WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE WANT STATUTORILY IF IF THE AUDITOR HAS QUESTIONS FOR YOU IF WE WERE THAT GO WITH THE MONITORING PROPOSAL AND I'M I'M INCLINED TO DEFERRED OUR COLLEAGUE AND I THINK IT'S MADE RISK MARKET BUT I'M? AMONG THE EDGE. IF IF THERE'S A REQUEST WILL YOU PROVIDE ALL THAT IS REQUESTED NOW REALIZE FROM EXPERIENCE THIS COMMITTEE HOW WILL SHE KNOW IF IT'S ALL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK AND FORTH IF THERE'S ANY MONKEY BUSINESS ABOUT THAT. IT'S GONNA BE TEN TIMES WORSE FOR YOU SO WILL YOU COMMIT IF THERE IF THE COMMITTEE SO CHOOSES TO GO FOR WITH THE MONITORING INSTEAD OF A FULL AUDIT. HERE THE YOU'LL GIVE THE AUDITOR WHATEVER SHE ASKS. FOR SYSTEM AND HOW ELSE WAS I RESPOND. I DON'T EVEN THE FOR YEARS BECAUSE I DO WANT TO JUST HEARING LAWYER I'M JUST COMMUTER LIAR I DON'T HAVE. THAT AND HE WILL RESPOND I DO A QUICK ONE THING -- AND I WANT TO ASK YOUR FLIRTATION I'M OF THE CITY PROVIDED IN MATERIALS BACK IN MAY THAT I AM I WOULD I WOULD HAVE AUDIT US THEN. TO NOT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ADEQUATE BUT THE MATERIALS PROVIDED IN JULY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DETAIL AHEAD WHEN INTO GREATER DETAIL BOTH FROM THE BUDGETING STANDPOINT FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT. AND FROM A BASE THE RESOLUTIONS THAT WERE PUT FORTH SO THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS THE ALMOST SIX HUNDRED PAGES WORTH OF DATA THAT THEY ONLY HAD FIVE DAYS TO REVIEW FIVE WORKING DAYS TO REVIEW. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE AUDITOR'S SAID WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND AUDIT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE DATA I WAS REFERRING TO AYE I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN JULY. NOT JUST A INDIAN IN MAY RIGHT SO I MAY COME BACK TO MADAM AUDITOR ON THAT BUT I AM HAPPY HERE FROM HER ATTORNEY. BUT GOOD THAT WHITEWATER TORTURE. THAT WHITE CHURCH WILL WHITE AND CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF ATWATER. I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR. I'M I'M I'M BOTH MYSELF AND THE CITY MANAGER OUR TIME AS THE TO APPOINTED OFFICIALS. UP FOR THE CITY ARE PREPARED TO FULLY TO REPRESENT ON THE CITY'S BEHALF THAT WE WILL FULLY COOPERATE. I'M WITH THE AUDITOR WE WILL PROVIDE THEM ANY INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED THIS IS NOT AN INTENT TO KIND OF HIDE OR PALATIAL GAMES. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT -- TO NOT BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN'T ATTRACT TALENT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE BOND RATINGS ARE GO GOING UP. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUDITOR I TALKED TO BOND COUNSEL EVERYDAY DO PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE A WHEN YOU GO THROUGHTHIS AUDIT -- IT HAS IMPACTS YOU DO IT BECAUSE IT HAS AN IMPACT -- IN THE IMPACT IS IS AND WILL HOPEFULLY BE POSITIVE FOR THE FOR THE THE RESIDENTS BUT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH THE THE SAME RESULT. WITH A JURISDICTION THAT WILLING TO KIND OF COOPERATE SO. I'M HERE TO TO SAY AS A AND THEY HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. YOU DO HAVE THE CITY'S COMMITMENT AND AS THE ENGINE CITY MANAGER I WILL MAKE SURE THAT. ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED ARE AVAILABLE AND IT'S EVERYTHING AT THE OUTER ASKS YOU CORRECT CLEAR REPRESENTING TWO YES TEN AND I ACTUALLY HAD SOME DOCUMENTS THAT WE THAT THEY HAD BREAK REQUESTED ADDITIONAL AND WE WERE FORTHCOMING AND THOSE AS SOON AS THEY ASK. BUT I THINK THAT IF IT'S NOT ON THAT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR FOR SIXTEEN SEPARATE DOCUMENTS AND WE RESPONDED TO ALL OF THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ACTUALLY THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND IS BACK NOTES APPRECIATING THE CONSISTENCY IN THE CLARITY OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE. SENT AND IF I COULD ONE OF THE PORTENTS WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE THE PRESUMPTIONS. IN THIS AUDIT REQUEST ARE ACTUALLY IN ACCURATE I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS IN IN IN THE POLICE. THERE HAS NOT BEEN THE ABILITY ON AT LEAST SINCE THIS TEAM HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE WE WERE GIVEN A TIME FRAME BY THE AUDITOR TO TO RESPOND. THAT THAT RESPONSE TIMELINE WAS AFTER WHICH THEY HAD THE KIND OF GET BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND SAY. HEY WE WANNA WE WANT. TO WE WANT THIS TO BE ON THE AGENDA THERE HAS NOT BEEN THE SUFFICIENT TIME TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN ON UNDER OKAY YOU DON'T HAVE YOU HEARD THE AUDITOR SAY WE DON'T THINK THIS IS SUFFICIENT. OKAY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RUN WITH IT WHAT YOU NEED IS TO IMPROVE MY MINUTES GOT YOU THERE BECAUSE YOU DON'T I I'M I'M ALMOST WITH YET BUT IF YOU START SAYING THAT BUT THE AUDITOR'S. MAKING PRESUMPTIONS IT'S NOT GONNA HELP YOUR ARGUMENT. SO -- IT MAY IF I MAY THE FINAL ONE JUST TO GO BACK THEN THE ORIGINAL QUESTIONS ABOUT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE. MORE RECENTLY THE JULY DOCUMENTS DO YOU MADAM AUDITOR FEEL THAT YOUR TEAM HAS HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO ANALYZE THOSE IN MAKING A RECOMMENDATION THAT A FULL AUDIT B.. RIGHT I THINK THE TIMING I WANNA MAKE SURE BECAUSE I I EXPLAIN THIS TO MR MERCHANT YESTERDAY SO I KNOW THERE WAS CONCERNED WITH THERE WAS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT. THE JAIL LIKE HEARING IN MAY WAS MIDDLEMAN. AND THEN WE THAT THAT THE DECISION WAS LET THE CITY PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US THE DEADLINE TO SUBMIT A REQUEST LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE YES WAS JULY SECOND. SO I HAD TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO MISTER MERCHANT COMMITTEE WHICH I DID WITH THE WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE CITY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO ASSESS THAT INFORMATION. I MET WITH MY STAFF A WEEK AND A HALF AGO WHEN. STILL ON BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT ON IF WE DON'T THINK AN AUDIT IS NECESSARY I NEED TO NOTIFY THE CHAIRMAN AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL OKAY AND MEETING WITH MY STAFF. I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT MATERIALS MEETING WITH MY STAFF THEY SAID YEAH WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THOSE MATERIALS. AND IN FAIRNESS TO THE CITY THEY HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR US TO SAY WE DON'T THINK IT OUGHT IT IS NECESSARY OUR CONCLUSION WAS NOW THAT IS WHY WE CAME FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN YES SO. AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER SOMETIMES ARTISTS JUST PREMATURE. AND IN THIS MAY BE ONE I THINK THAT WATER HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. AGAIN THIS IS A THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE ASKED FOR A HOLD ON IT ON IT. AND THERE WILL NOT BE A THIRD TIME NUMBER ONE I WILL NOT BE IN THE LEGISLATURE I WILL NOT BE ON THIS COMMITTEE. SO COME NEXT FEBRUARY IF THE CITY OF ATWATER HAS NOT. MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS YOU WILL AUDIT THEM AND SO I'M JUST SAYING BASED ON THE WORKLOAD OF THE AUDITOR -- SHE'S INDICATED THAT THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY TO FORTY DOLLARS BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE ARE A FEBRUARY RATHER. SO THE NEXT MEETING OF THE JAIL I COMMITTEES IN FEBRUARY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK WITH THE AUDITOR ON THE MONITORING. IF THEY DON'T HIT IT -- I WILL CO APPEAR AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT FROM THE AUDIENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDIT BUT AT THIS POINT I THINK THEY'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SO DOUBTS THAT WE HOLD. NOTHING HEALTH OKAY I'LL STAY HOME. NOW ARE INNOCENT -- ANY -- ONE FROM THE GUTYES CENTER FULLER CELL AND I THINK THE SCHEDULE SENSE GOOD BECAUSE I'M BACK TO THE DMV AND I WANT YOU TO DOUBLE UP SO.

AUDIT REQUESTS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY -- PLEASE. KEEP IN MIND THAT -- WE HAVE TWO ITEMS LEFT IN THAT SOME OF US INCLUDING MYSELF IS NOT HAVE LUNCH AND IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S BEEN. WORKING HARD AND NEED YOU ALSO HAVE A THE CHAIRS AYE RECOMMENDATION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- BRIEFLY MR SHARE ALL -- GIVE SOME BACKGROUND -- THANK YOU MEMBERS LEARN BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE. AND THE CONSOLES FOR THEIR WORK -- AS YOU NOTE PART FISH WILDLIFE IS ONE OF A PLACE IMPORTANT ROLE AS IT RELATES TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE -- MANAGING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE -- WILDLIFE RIGHT RESOURCES. AND THE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS PATIENT IN THE CALIFORNIA GRAMMAR QUALITY ACT WHICH IS ARGUABLY CALIFORNIA'S MOST IMPORTANT IN DRIVE UP TO ACTUALIZE CRITICAL -- TO THAT DEPARTMENT MEETING ITS MISSION. THIS OUT ROBUST PROCESS HAS ESTABLISHED BY SEQUEL A HAS BEEN IN PLACE MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AND IT REQUIRES ALL RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES TO BE NOTIFIED OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT. IT REQUIRES RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES TO RESPOND -- CONSULTATION BY THE LEAD AGENCY IN ORDER SAYS THAT LEAD AGENCY AND PREPARING ADEQUATE VITAMIN A DOCUMENTS. I IT'S CRUCIAL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS ASSIST THEM DETERMINE NECESSARY MEDICATIONS FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BENEFIT FROM THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PROCESS FROM THE EXPERTISE OF CALIFORNIA'S AND THE STATE AGENCIES IN MAKING A FINAL DECISION ON PROJECTS. EARLY THIS YEAR AND IS LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT COMPLY WITH THAT STATUTORILY MANDATED REQUIREMENTS NOW THAT MAY SEEM ODD THAT YOU WOULD INTRODUCE A BILL TO TELL FOLKS TO DO WHAT THE READY STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO DO. BUT IN THIS CASE -- BECAUSE OF SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR HOME AREA THAT WHICH IS. NECESSARY. IN RESPONSE THAT LEGISLATION DEPARTMENT A KID THAT IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT ONLY HAD THE RESOURCES TO ENGAGE IN 50%. OF THE PROJECTS THAT FALL WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION. CORD TO COMMITTEE HOUSES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT THE CONSTRAINTS ON FUNDS FORCES DEPARTMENT USE JUDGMENT AS TO WHICH SECRET PROCEEDINGS ARE MOST LIKELY TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT -- APPROVAL OR PERMITS. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY I REQUEST THE STATE AUDITOR EXAMINE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S RESOURCE ALLOCATION SPENDING PRIORITIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT COMPLIES OR DOES NOT COMPLY. WITH ITS STATUTORY ROLE AS A RESPONSIBLE AGENCY UNDER SEQUENCE. ALL RIGHT DO YOU HAVE. ANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. I DON'T -- MISTER CHAIR AND I HAVE ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND I CAN PROVIDE THAT ALL WAIT FOR MEMBERS. TO ASK QUESTIONS IF NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT BACKGROUND ALRIGHT PARA -- AT MS HOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY INDICATED WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW AND LOOK AT REQUESTS THAT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HAS RECEIVED WHERE THEY WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBLE AGENCY. FOR A SEQUEL REVIEW AND THEIR ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE COOL THOSE REQUESTS -- AND AGAIN AS AS MISTER GRAY INDICATED. HE REALLY WANTS TO UNDERSTAND -- WHETHER OR NOT FISH AND WILDLIFE IS MEETING ITS STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT IS DEEMED A RESPONSIBLE AGENCY UNDER SEAQUEST SO WE WOULD LOOK AT SOME SICK OR REQUESTS AND LOOK AT PROCESS. IN ADDITION AS HE INDICATED WE WOULD LOOK AT THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES HOW WAS FISH AND GAME. ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THESE TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITIES AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT FISH FISH AND WILDLIFE IS RESPONSIBLE -- FOR AND I'D A ASSESS THE JUST OF SOME OF THOSE ALLOCATIONS AND AND DETERMINATIONS AS FAR AS STAFFING AND EXPENDITURES -- HE'S ALSO ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS THAT ARE FUNDED INCLUDING THE SEQUEL PROCESS OUT ALSO HABITAT MANAGEMENT WANTING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MANY STAFF -- PERCENTAGES OF STAFF IN AND DOLLARS ASSOCIATED STAFF DEDICATED TO HAVE A TAPE HABITAT MANAGEMENT FIRST SEQUEL VERSUS OTHER FUNCTIONS. DIDN'T TEARS ME -- AND THEN ASKING US ABOUT EARLY PARTICIPATION IS THERE ARE AWAY THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE CAN BE INVOLVED EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. ONTO THEIR SECRET PROCESS AND CERTAINLY POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND THEN THE FINAL OBJECTIVE HE ASKED ASTUTE TO ACCOMPLISH WAS REALLY LOOKING AT THE FUNDING. SO HOW IS FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGING THE FUNDS THEY RECEIVE FROM C. COFFEES AND WHETHER OR NOT IT SPENDING THOSE FUNDS OR OR RE FUNDING AND SOME CASES. ARE THOSE THOSE FEES AND COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW -- THE AUDIT IS BUDGETED AT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED HOURS IT BUT AROUND A SIX MONTH WINDOW OUGHT TO COMPLETE THE WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'D LIKE TO INVITE A REP CENTER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IF. YES IN THE AUDIENCE HERE. HOW WE ALREADY HEARD ATTRACT THANK YOU [inaudible] ACT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. I WAS HERE THIS MORNING WHEN YOU STARTED. YOU ASKED FOR A STATEMENT OF POSITION IN UNDER TWO MINUTES THEREFORE -- WITH RESPECT TO MISTER GRAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU DENY THIS REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT FIRST THIS BAKER. I RECALL WHAT YOU SAID ALMOST FOUR HOURS AGO. THAT YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR RESOLUTION. FOR REACHING OUT TO AFFECTED DEPARTMENTS. TO RESOLVE THE ITEM. WITHOUT LEGISLATION OR NEED FOR AUDIT. I HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH MISTER GREGG. I BELIEVE I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR FOR HIM AND ANY MEMBER. ON ANY ISSUE. MR GRAY REFERENCED A BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS AB THIRTY ONE NO. TO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN IN THIS GREAT ABOUT MISTER GRAY ABOUT THE BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS WITHDRAWN. UNTIL THIS MORNING RIGHT NOW I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT THIS AUDIT REQUEST. I THINK MY DOOR WOULD BE OPEN AND I'M GOING TO WORK WITH HIM ON THE CONCERNS HIS RACE IN THIS LETTER [inaudible] SECOND REASON. WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE STATE AUDITOR. I BELIEVE IN AUDIT ON THIS NARROW SCOPE [inaudible] AGAINST. ALL THE MANY AUDITS THAT ARE PUT TO THE STATE AUDITOR. WOULD NOT BE A STRATEGIC USE OF FUNDS AND TIME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE JUST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO YOU THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND GAVE US A STATUTORY DIRECTIVE. TO IMPLEMENT A SERVICE BASED BUDGET REVIEW. THERE ARE STRICT TIMELINES AND YOUR DIRECTIVE TO US. THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR REPORTING IN HEARING OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES YOU GAVE US IN STATUTE. AND THE INSTRUCTIONS BROADLY ARE A TO TO IDENTIFY OUR GOALS ARE CORPS PROGRAM SERVICE STANDARDS ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES. DEVELOP COST ESTIMATES STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. ANALYZING CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS ACTIVITIES COST COMPARISONS ANALYZING EXISTING REVENUE STRUCTURE. I WELCOME THAT ASSIGNMENT YOU GIVE US UNDER THE BUDGET PATHWAY. I WANNA MEET AND EXCEED ALL EXPECTATIONS THROUGH THAT PATH WHERE. I WANT TO USE THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WIDELY WISELY. AND BECAUSE SEQUEL IS A CORE FUNCTION OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF MAPS LEE CERTAIN IT'S GOING TO BE SCRUBBED. REVIEWED DISCUSSED AND PRESENTED TO YOU IN A MULTIPLE KIND OF OVERSIGHT HEARINGS IN THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF. SO FOR THOSE TWO REASONS I RECOMMEND YOU NOT APPROVE THIS AUDIT. HI I'VE BEEN HERE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AS THE DISCUSSION AS WELL. ALRIGHT THANK YOU FOR A YEAR CONCISE -- PRESENTATION QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER ABOUT -- IS SO INNOCENT REMEMBER ROME AND THE AUDITOR -- BECAUSE I DWELLED ON THE SUBJECT A LOT. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE TRANSPORTATION -- HOUSING COMMITTEE -- DOES THIS INCLUDE THE PROCESSING OF OF OF HER MINUTES IN ADDITION TO SEE COR. AND DOES IT INCLUDE -- THE IDEA THAT. IF SOMEBODY HAS A PERMIT THE REQUESTING. THAT THEY CAN PAY EXTRA FUNDS. TO THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPEDITE. TWO IN OTHER WORDS TO PAY FOR YOU KNOW HE'S SAYING THAT. HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH. STAFF RESOURCES. TO DO THE JOB TO PROCESS ALL THE PERMITS THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING STUFF. SO. A RESPONSE TO THAT OBVIOUS WOULD BE OKAY IF SOMEBODY HAS A PERMIT LIKE -- SAY A WATER AGENCY. FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY OR WHATEVER THE SIMPLY GIVE THE DEPARTMENT SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS. TO COVER THE COST OF DOING TO PERMIT. IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LOOKED AT IN THIS IN THIS AUDIT. ALL DOT ORG IT AUTOMATICALLY AUDITOR'S ARE IS A SINGER ASKING DOES THE AUDIT LETTER REQUEST COVER YEAH BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HE'S GOT HE'S GOT. SEIZE GOT A HUNDRED HUNDRED TO A PERMITS HE'S GOT A LOOK AT BUT HE'S ONLY GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR SEVENTY FIVE OHMS THAT MEANS THAT. TWENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO BE -- MAYBE NOT. PROCEEDED WITH EXPEDITIOUSLY. YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF WHAT. WHAT I GOT OUT OF PRISON TO JUST TWO PRESENTERS? SO DISSIDENT CLUED LIKE THE IDEA THAT. SE -- AGENCIES THAT WANT TO GET PERMITS PROCESS EXPEDITIOUSLY. IN A NORMAL FASHION -- THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY. FOR THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE IN THE THE AUDIT ANALYSIS AND BASED ON SPA ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAZE REQUEST THAT ASKS US NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT SEQUEL BUT TO LOOK AT OTHER FUNCTIONS. THAT FISHING GAME IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THE DECISION MAKING AS FAR AS STAFFING FOR THOSE PARTICULAR FUNCTIONS WHAT WHERE THE PRIORITIES AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON UP SUPPORTING THOSE FUNCTIONS. YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY CAN. I THINK WE WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT'S JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE WHAT MR GRAY'S ASKING US IS. TO LOOK AT EXPENDITURE STAFFING LEVELS FOR OTHER FUNCTIONS WITHIN FISH AND GAME AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT'S JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT DECISION MAKING SO I THINK WE MAY GET OUT WHAT YOU WERE. ASKING ABOUT A LOT OF LOVE THESE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BUT PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS MISTER CHAIRMAN. THEY THE THEY SEE THIS IS A BOTTLENECK FOR GETTING THAT JUST. JUST THE TIME IT TAKES BECAUSE TIME IS MONEY SO THEY'RE NOT ABLE -- TO IN EFFECT GO OUT TO BID UNTIL THEY HAVE ALL THESE CLEARANCES HE'S PERMITS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] THE I DID WOULD BE -- SOMETHING THE WE WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WITH SO WHEN I CHAIRED THE TRAFFIC AUTHORITY BUILDING FREEWAYS IN [inaudible] SOUNDS AYE. WE JUST SIMPLY PAID CALTRANS AND THESE AGENCIES SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO COVER THE COST OF PROCESSING OF PERMITS WE HAVE. SENATOR FROM AND AND THEY GOT THE MONEY AND THEN THEY THEY HIRE WHATEVER STAFF THEY NEED AND THEN THEY GO. PROCESS THE PERMITS IT I MAKE IT A SIMPLE STATEMENT HERE WAS MORE COMPLICATED LIKE TALKING ABOUT BUT OKAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND YES SENATOR. BUT THREE THOUGHTS FIRST. AS I MENTIONED YOU TIP OF BEFORE I AM THE FIRST DIRECTOR OF THIS DEPARTMENT. FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU KNOW WHO'S TRIED TO GET A PERMIT FROM THE VERY DEPARTMENT I NOW I'M DIRECTOR OF SO I UNDERSTAND THIS CONUNDRUM. SECOND THE WAY I READ THE AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS OR REQUEST IT'S MORE ABOUT [inaudible] THE DEPARTMENT'S -- REQUIREMENTS TO COMMENT ON DOCUMENTS. IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS. ALTHOUGH I CONFESS [inaudible] A FULL. INSPECTION EXAM MORE SURVEY OR ASSESSMENT. MAY TOUCH OTHER ITEMS ABOUT EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVEMENTS. AND THE HAPPENED SEVERAL BILLS SOME AUTHORED BY YOU OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS WHICH HAVE BECOME LAW THAT ARE MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION. IF YOU LOOK BACK IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE GOT ABOUT. EIGHTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS MITIGATE MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS THAT'S THE VOLUME COMING IN TO US THAT WE HAVE SOME. NEED TO REVIEW PRIORITIZE AND RESPOND. TO I'M NOT AWARE OF MY STAFF HAVING SAID ANYTHING. DURING THE COURSE OF AB THIRTY ONE OR TWO ABOUT DOING 50% OR NOT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S A REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BUT I CAN CONFIRM WHEN I LOOKED INTO THIS. THAT IN THE MID NINETIES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE DEPARTMENT GOT THE FIRST ABILITY TO INCREASE FILING FEES FOR SECRET DOCUMENT REVIEW. WE CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE TALKED ABOUT WORK LOAD. AND THAT PROCESS PRODUCED A FEE. WHICH ALLOWS US A DO ABOUT 50% OF THIS WORKLOAD ANNUAL. THE NEXT THING THE LEGISLATURE DID MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY GAVE US. CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INFLATION ABILITY RELATED TO THAT FEE THAT WAS SET IN THE MID NINETIES. SO ALL WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THEN IS INCREASING BASED ON CPR. I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF SOMEONE DOES THIS REVIEW WILL LIKELY OUTCOME IS THE VERY COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE STRUGGLING. PRIOR TO PROCESS PAPERWORK ARE GOING TO BE FACING A FEE INCREASE. I WOULD WELCOME MISTER GRAY'S CHO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME ON GOING TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TO PROPOSE A FEE INCREASE ON SEQUEL REVIEW. SOME PEOPLE WOULD PREFER MATTERED MISTER CHAIRMAN PAIN UP. A SMALL FEE THEN. THE TIME AND COST OF A DELAY OF THE PROJECT. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S SO THE POINT I'M MAKING SO IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO JUST. OKAY -- FOR THE PROCESSING RATHER THAN -- TAKEN -- A HIT ON A SIX MONTH DELAY ON A PROJECT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROCESS [inaudible] THE PAPERWORK -- EXPEDITIOUSLY AND FOR LIKE SAY A A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT THAT'S SIX MONTH DELAY COULD BE LIKE. THREE OR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND COST INCREASES GETS AYE AYE HERE TO SING SENATOR AYE. BUT I GUY I WANT TO FOCUS. ON THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT REQUEST AND THAT'S WHERE THE PUBLIC RESEARCHER FROM MY CHINAMEN. OUR TO THIS DISCUSSION THANK YOU CENTER FOR THE QUESTION THANK YOU TO SAVE MONEY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST BOTH IN SAVING MONEY AND IMPROVING THE PROCESS -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE DIRECTOR AND AND YOU KNOW THE DIRECTOR MADE SOME COMMENTS THAT HE AND I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN AN OPEN DOOR AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND WE'VE HAD MANY INTERACTIONS. ON MANY ISSUES -- THERE WAS REFERENCE TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THERE WAS IN FACT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BY DEALING WITH ARE THE FISCAL ISSUES AROUND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE GOAL OF THAT PARTICULAR ARE REVIEW -- IS FOR THE PARCHMENT. TO GET GUIDANCE ON HOW DEVELOPER SERVER SPACE BUDGET TRACKING SYSTEM. I'M IN MY MIND AND IN RESPECT TO SENATORS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE GOAL THE AUDIT. IN THE SENSE THAT -- IN THE REVIEWS NOT DESIGNED TO ADDRESS COMPLIANCE ISSUES BUT YOU'RE KIND RATHER STRICTLY FISCAL ISSUES AND THE DIRECTOR RAISES THE QUESTION OF FEES ARE INCREASED FEES AND AS STAFFING LEVELS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH -- A THAT REVIEWS THAT CAN BE COMPLETED IT'S NOT REQUIRED STATUTORY BECOME CLEAN TELL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BONTA BUT BE I DON'T THINK THAT IT ADDRESSES PERHAPS INADEQUACIES THAT LIE ELSEWHERE THAT PERHAPS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE LAW ITSELF RIGHT. THIS AUDIT I'M NOT BRINGING FORWARD IS MUCH TO BE FISCAL AUDIT OF THE DIRECTORS DEPARTMENT AS IT IS LET'S TAKE A REVIEW OF OF THE PROCESS AND THE STATUES ON THE BOOK. ARE AND HOW THOSE ARE WORKING AND THAT. WILL LEND ITSELF TO BETTER INFORMING -- OUR BODY AYE IF WE NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE WORK IN THIS AREA TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS -- AT ALL LEAVES THE DEVELOPER FEES TO THE DIRECTOR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO HIM. UP FOR GOOD FOR THE TIME BEING -- BY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE STAKES THERE'S THE FISCAL ISSUES AND UNDERSUPPLY IT'S ISSUES THAT'S WHERE THE ART IS DIRECTED -- CERTAINLY NOT -- SAYING THAT THE DEPARTMENT I ISN'T ABLE TO WEAR HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO OUR LANE THAT AT THEIR DOORSTEP AS MUCH AS I'M LAYING AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE TO HAVE A BETTER PROCESS. IF THAT MAKES SENSE MISTER CHAIR YES AND SO -- NOT WITHSTANDING. IT IS MISTER BOTTOM RIGHT CORRECT YES -- AT NO RISK AND THAT WAS THAT MR BOTTOMS -- INDICATIONS THAT HE WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU YOU -- WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR I REQUEST ITS ACT I DO WANT TO CONTINUE IT I I WELCOME THE DIRECTOR BONHAM'S -- ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM AS WELL BUT I THINK THE AUDIT WILL BE IN. FOR IT'S A GOOD TOOL FOR US HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS GOING FORWARD A ON THE SECRET PROCESS AND THE STATUE AS IT RELATES TO DEPARTMENT WOULD. WITH RESPECT THOUGH. IF THE LIMITATION IS A SEQUEL THAT I WOULD POSE THE QUESTION WHY IN THE AUDIT LETTER IS QUESTION. SIX WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE DEPARTMENT STAFF IS DEVOTED TO HABITAT MANAGEMENT HOUSE THE HABITAT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FUNDED. SO I AM CONFUSED IN THE SCOPE AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP DISCUSSING WITH THE FOR QUESTOR. A POSSIBLE SCHOOL. ALRIGHT WELL -- THE REQUESTED IS AS STATED IN THE WRITTEN LETTER AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DELIBERATING WITH THIS COMMITTEE -- AND BEGIN CERTAINLY. I I DON'T THINK THAT THE AUDITOR HAS ANY QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT THE INTENT OF THE ITEM NUMBER SIX CITIZENS SO THAT HIS. WHAT IS RELEVANT AT THIS POINT CENTER FULLER? SO I JUST US WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT -- THE DIRECTORIES -- CORRECTIVE BOWED HIS OPEN DOOR AND I'VE USED IT MANY TIMES AND I'VE APPRECIATED AT HOWEVER.

FOR THE CARD ROOM INDUSTRY THAT GAMBLING CONTROL FUND WAS CREATED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE BUREAU. AND COMMISSION TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN REGULATING THE SEVENTY FOUR ACTIVE CARD ROOMS. IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS IN THE PROCESS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND IN THOSE TWENTY YEARS.

AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED UNDER CURRENT LAW A GAMING LICENSE REVIEW IS REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.

TO ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG APPROXIMATELY TWENTY EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE BUREAU IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AUGMENTED. THE BUREAU'S BUDGET TO ALLOW FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE POSITIONS TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT ADDITIONAL STAFF WOULD HELP THE BUREAU RESOLVED THE BACKLOG IN THREE YEARS BUT IT DIDN'T. THAT BACKLOG STILL EXIST TODAY AT ABOUT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CASES.

THAT I FELT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST JOIN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR A LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE. NEARLY ALL THE APPLICANTS THAT ARE SENT TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING FOR FOR THE REVIEW COME FROM. A RACIAL ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUND IN NEARLY 40% ARE OF AN API BACKGROUND NOT IT WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL APPLICANTS ARE BEING TREATED THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN OR GENDER -- AND WE'RE HOPING. TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THERE IS ANY DESPERATE IMPACT ON CERTAIN OUT RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS AUDIT IS JERRY BROWN WITH BLONDIE IN BOYD AND CONDIT PUBLIC AFFAIRS AS WELL AS JACQUELINE FOO. WITH LUCKY CHANCES. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER BHAKTA. EVEN THE BEST DESIGN REGULATORY SYSTEMS CAN FAIL IF STRUCTURES CHECKS AND BALANCES DO NOT PREVENT IMPROPER INFLUENCE OVER DECISION MAKING. IN GAMING REGULATORY SYSTEMS BRITAIN -- REGULATORS HAVE BROAD DISCRETION OVER MAKING DECISIONS AND THERE'S OF FEELING WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THAT THAT THE REGULATORY SYSTEM. IS NOT IN A CONDUCTING THINGS IN A FAIR AND BALANCED MATTER. AND NOT IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS AND DECISIONS ARE MADE BEING MADE AND A FAIR AND CONSISTENT MANNER. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE JOINT. LEGISLATIVE I'VE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JACQUELINE BILL AND I'M WITH THE BUCKLED HER LAW FIRM. I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF LUCKY CHEN. SUPPORT FOR THE REQUESTED AUDIT. LUCKY CHANCES IS A LICENSED GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENT THAT'S LOCATED IN THE CITY A COMMA CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY AMANDA RENEE MEDINA WHO CAME TO THE U. S. WITH A HUNDRED DOLLARS IS POCKET. SELECT THE CASINO ITSELF NOW CURRENTLY EMPLOYS OVER IN. FIVE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE. IN MAY TWO AND MAY TWENTY SEVENTEEN LUCKY CHANCES SUBMITTED A COMPARTMENT YUSHIN TO RENEW ITS LICENSE TO THE BUREAU. AND IT IS AN INDISPUTABLY COMPLIED WITH ALL REQUIRED CONDITIONS FOR THE RENEWAL. DESPITE THIS THE BUREAU RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMMISSION DENY LUCKY CHANCES -- APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL BASED ON A TWO THOUSAND SIX IRIS REPORTS. FEDERAL LAW INCLUDING THE BANK SECRECY ACT MANDATES THAT EVERY CASINO THAT GENERATES OVER MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE IN THE YEAR IMPLEMENTS POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT MONTH TO MONTH MONEY LAUNDERING DOES NOT HAPPEN. SO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DURING A ROUTINE AUDITS. LUCKY CHANCES RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE IRS OUTLINING SOME MINOR BUT TECHNICAL DEFEAT DEFICIENCIES IN THEIR INTERNAL MY ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING SO -- POLICIES. AS A RESULT OF THAT -- THE BECAUSE THOSE ARE DEFICIENCIES WERE MINOR THEY WERE NOT FIND AND THE IRIS DIDN'T SEEM NECESSARY TO REFER THEM TO THE FENCE AND DEPARTMENT UP THE IRS. FOLLOWING THAT AUDIT. BUT YOUR CHANCES IN TOOK IMMEDIATE MEASURES THROUGH THAT FIX THESE EFFICIENCIES INCLUDING HIRING ATTORNEY. WHO WAS SPECIALIZED IN THE BSA AND SHE OVER LEX NOW THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS? THEY IMPLEMENTED A COMPUTER I SYSTEM TO KEEP TRACK OF CASH DEPOSITS [inaudible] AND PREPARED NEW ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES WIKISPECIES. NO VIOLATIONS OR IN ADDITION THE BUREAU THE BUREAU AUDITOR'S REVIEW THESE POLICIES DURING AND AUDIT TO THE AUDIT IN JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NO VIOLATIONS. A WERE FOUND. DESPITE THIS THE BUREAU HAS USED THIS REPORT AS A BASIS FOR THE REST IN PEACE FOR THEIR RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMISSION. TO DENY LUCKY CHANCES THEIR RIGHT TO RENEW THEIR LICENSE. ALTERNATIVELY THE BUREAU HAS STATED HAS RECOMMENDED TO THE COMMISSION THAT INSTEAD OF DENYING THEIR GREEN MEAN STATE FOR DENYING THE RENEWAL. THE BEER HAS STATED THAT. COMMISSION ALLOW THEM TO RENEW THEIR LICENSE ON THE CONDITION THAT THE CASINO TERMINATE THESE CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THE MILIEU RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE THIRD PARTY BUSINESS ENTITIES AND THAT THE CHANCES -- NAM AND I'M GONNA ASK YOU NOT TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR -- CASE BUT OF PERHAPS IN TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS. THE AND SUPPORTS THIRD THE AUDIT REQUEST UNDERSTOOD DO WE WE WE HAVE NO FACTUAL BASIS. TO YOU KNOW TO DETERMINE THIS IS NOT THE FACT FINDING BODY FOR THIS PARTICULAR [inaudible] UNDERSTOOD SO OUR POSITION IS -- CHAIRMAN THAT LUCKY CHANCE IT HAS BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF A SMALL. OF A SAMPLE OF THE THE LARGER PICTURE -- THERE HAS BEEN X. WE HAVE BEEN EXPECT THE CASINO ITSELF HAS EXPERIENCE SOME BIAS. FROM THE CASINO I MEAN FROM THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE -- THE OWNER OF THE CASINO MISS. IT'S A MEDINA THE FILIPINO IMMIGRANTS -- THE CASINO EMPLOYEES ABOUT SIX AND A FIFTY PEOPLE THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE OF FILIPINO DESCENT. AND THERE HAVE BEEN COMMENTS MADE ON THE RECORD BY THE BUREAU. THAT HAVE. INSINUATED THAT THE CASINOS INVOLVED IN MUNCIE -- MONEY LAUNDERING BECAUSE CASINOS OWNERS ALSO OWN A CASHED CASH DEPOSITING BUSINESS THAT HAPPENS. TO YOU KNOW -- CATER TO THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY. WHO WOULD SEND MONEY BACK TO THE PHILIPPINES -- SO SO BASED ON THAT. AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE THE LARGER PICTURE OF YOU KNOW THE UNFAIR TREATMENT FROM THE BUREAU AND SO OUR REQUEST IS THAT. IF YOU DO YOU APPROVE THE AUDIT YOU KNOW. OUR GOAL IS HERE TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BUREAU INFORMATION WHICH WILL NO DOUBT HELPED IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS ARE THE RESULTS. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THAT'S HOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE M.. GAMBLING CAN CONTROL COMMISSION BUT PRIMARILY LOOKING AT BEER OF CAMPBELL IN CONTROL AND A VARIETY OF OBJECTIVES RELATED TO THEIR EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND PROCESSING BACKGROUND CHECKS OF BOTH GANTT GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS AND LICENSEES. BOMB MAKING SURE THAT THEIR PROCESSING APPLICATIONS AND FOLLOWING STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE REQUIREMENTS AS FAR AS TIME FRAMES IDENTIFY IF THERE IS ANY BACKLOG -- THE BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG AND ANY -- STRATEGIES THAT THE BUREAU HAS FOR ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG A AS MISTER BONTA INDICATED HE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE THE BUREAU OF GAMBLER. TEACHERS AND TREATING ALL APPLICANTS THE SAME OFF. AND CONSISTENTLY -- ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK AT IT WHETHER OR NOT TRY TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S ANY IMPROPER USE OF OF FUNDS OUT SO WE WOULD BE DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF THAT. ALSO LOOKING AT THERE'S A SECTION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE INDIAN OUR GAMING LAW SECTION THAT LOOKS AT CONTRACTS IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT THEIR PROCESS FOR EVALUATING IN REVIEWING THOSE CONTRACTS. AND AGAIN ARE THEY FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS IN TREATING. ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED THOSE CONTRACTS FAIR IN A FAIR MANNER WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMISSION. HE'S INTERESTED IN ARE US LOOKING AT THE A SELECTION OF COMMISSION MEETINGS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT. OUGHT SELECT SOME OF THE MATTERS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS AS FAR AS ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE ANY ANY OTHER PARTICULAR. STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THE COMMISSION AND THEN THE FINAL OBJECTIVE IS RELATED. TO IS THERE A SURPLUS BALANCE IN THE GAMBLING FUND OUGHT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT -- THAT SURPLUS IS TOO HIGH IS IT REASONABLE ARE AND AND BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEED TO BE ADJUSTMENTS TO FEES THAT APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES ARE PAY. THE BUDGET FOR THE AUDIT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS -- SIX MONTHS WORTH OF STAFF TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO NOW INVITE TO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL -- AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO GO LAST THANK YOU FOR STICKING IN THERE WITH US. THE STATE THE WINNER BAXTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY CONTROL COMMISSION. LOWER RESPECT THE AUTHORITY OF THIS PROCESS AND CERTAINLY THE STATE AUDITOR THE REQUEST CAUGHT COVERS AN EXTREMELY BROAD SCOPE OF ISSUES SUCH AS THE AUDITOR JUST LAID OUT. ISSUES WE BELIEVE CAN BE RESOLVED AT MUCH LESS EXPENSE TO THE STATE WITH OPEN COMMUNICATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BEER ON THE COMMISSION TO KNOW THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WERE ACTUALLY HEARING ALLEGATIONS MADE. AND THE ABILITY TO FOR US TO PROVIDE FACTUAL COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS. THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE MEMBERS RESPOND TO EACH ISSUE OUTLINES SO I WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE OUTLINED WHICH IS THE DISPARITY TREATMENT THAT'S BEEN ALLEGED. THE COMMISSION FOLLOWS THE LAWS OUTLINED IN THE GAMING CONTROL ACT IN SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS ADOPTED WHEN CONDUCTING ITS ROLES RESPONSIBILITY. THE COMMISSION IS TRANSPARENT EIGHT IS A TRANSPARENT AGENCY THAT FALLS ABOUT BREAKING OPEN MEETING ACT CONDUCTS ALL MEANS PUBLICLY. PROVIDES RECORDS OF ALL ME ALL MEETINGS ONLINE. AND ALONG WITH COPIES OF THE DECISIONS EVEN THE ONE WITH REGARDS TO LUCKY CHANCES ONLINE THROUGH ITS WEBSITE. THE COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH ENSURING INTEGRITY IN THE CONTROL GAMBLING INDUSTRY COUPLED WITH THE STATUTES THAT ARE OUTGOING CERTAIN MANDATORY DISQUALIFIER STE. SUCH AS FELONY CONVICTIONS FOR CRIMES OF DISHONESTY THE CONDITIONS THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS INTEGRITY WITHIN THE INDUSTRY PINE SHARING ONLY PEOPLE OF GOOD CHARACTER. HONESTY AND INTEGRITY MAKE UP OR ARE INVOLVED IN THE GAMBLING CONTROL WITH A CARTON INDUSTRY. THE COMMISSIONER'S DECISIONS ON WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS SUITABLE FOR LICENSE OR SOLELY BASED ON A REPORT THAT IS PROVIDED TO US BY THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL. AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. AND ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED TO US THROUGH THE APPLICANTS. THE REPORT IS LIMITED TO INFORMATION SUCH AS CRIMINAL HISTORY EMPLOYMENT HISTORY FINANCIAL HISTORY IN ANY LITIGATION HISTORY OR ANY OTHER -- DEROGATORY INFORMATION THAT WAS FOUND OUT THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION. THE COMMISSIONERS TYPICALLY DO NOT KNOW FIND INFORMATION OF THOSE APPLICANTS. SUCH AS ETHNICITY OR ANY TYPE OF PROTECT. THE SUGGESTION THAT AN APPLICANT'S ETHNICITY HAS ANY ROLE IN THIS PROCESS IS NOT ONLY DISTURBING BUT UNFOUNDED. ALL APPLICANTS MUST UNDERGO THE SAME PROCESS ARE AFFORDED THE SAME RIGHTS. SAME DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND ARE TREATED FAIRLY REGARDLESS OF THE BACKGROUND FINDINGS. WITH RESPECT TO THE LUCKY CHANCES WHAT THEY DID NOT. PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ON IS THE DECISION WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT AYE A CONVICTED FELON WAS OPERATING WITHIN THE CARTER. OKAY I AM GONNA GIVE THE SAME -- ADMONITION AS I GAVE TO DIG INTO THE TURNED REPRESENT LIKE AGAINST BUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MUCH OF THE DETAILS OF ONE PARTICULAR CASE THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THAT NUMBER WITH RESPECT. WE REQUEST THAT THIS BE DENIED INLAND BE ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE INFORMATION FACTUAL AND COMPLETE INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO THESE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SAY GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON. THAT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEPHANIE SCHMEISER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF GALLON CONTROL WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ALSO HERE WITH ME AS CHRIS RYAN WHO IS OUR CHIEF OF OPERATIONS AT THE OJ. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THEIR QUEST FOR AN AUDIT OF THE BUREAU AS WELL AS THE COMMISSION -- IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ANYTHING GAME LAW SECTION. WE HAD DISTRIBUTED LETTER -- THAT RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE STATEMENTS NOW ENGAGES IN THE AUTUMN REQUEST AND HOPE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO REVIEW IT APOLOGIZED CONSENT IN LATE IN THE GAME. I GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT REQUEST CONTAIN SOME INACCURATE STATEMENTS CONCLUSIONS AND A BASIC MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE BUREAU'S AN IDEALIST IS RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCESSES. ADDITIONALLY AND AS HIS BACK JUST BAXTER STATED. THAT MOST CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TAKES GREAT ISSUE WITH THE REQUESTS UNFOUNDED ALLEGATION THAT APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES FROM CERTAIN RACIAL BACKGROUNDS. NATIONAL ORIGINS MAY BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY SPECIFICALLY THE ASIA PACIFIC ISLAND ISLANDER COMMUNITY -- THE CLAIM THAT ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAY BE THE FOCUS OF UNNECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS IN DESPAIR TREATMENT IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ANY EXAMPLES STATISTICS OR OTHER INFORMATION FROM WHICH WE COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CLAIM IS COMING FROM. I AM NEITHER THE BUREAU NOR THE IDEALIST TREAT APPLICANTS LICENSEES DIFFERENTLY BASED ON RACE OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. I CAN SURE YOU THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH ACTION. SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES OUTLINED THE LETTER DID NOT SURPRISE US WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM INDUSTRY BEFORE. WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN CARBON REPRESENTATIVES NOTIFIED THE BUREAU THAT I'M USED INVESTIGATION DEPOSITS PAID BY CARD ROOMS WEREN'T BEING RETURNED PROBABLY -- STEP WAS IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED TO INITIATE THE PROCESS TO RETURN THOSE UNUSED DEPOSITS WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE FINAL DECISION ON AN APPLICATION. I'M AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS DELAYS EITHER REAL OR PERCEIVED REGARDING THE STATEMENTS OF ISSUES -- FILING AND APPROVAL TRANSACTIONS THE BEER ALSO TO HAS TAKEN SOME ACTION. A NEW PROCESS WAS INSTITUTED TO EXPLOIT THE FILING OF STATEMENTS OF ISSUES -- BY MEDIALLY REFERRING CASES TO AYE JLS INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR AND KNOWS THAT DEFENSE TO COME IN FROM AN APPLICANT -- HEROES ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING IT FIRST IN HOUSE ATTORNEY TO REVIEW TRANSACTIONS. AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE WORKLOAD ON AYE GLS. THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT BACKLOGS TO WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. BUT RESPECT TO THE BACKLOG OF THE LICENSING APPLICATIONS THE BUREAU HAS DRAMATICALLY DECREASED THAT BACKLOG OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- FOR SOME NUMBERS IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS BEFORE US WAS. THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN AT THE END OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS WAS. ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN ASH EXPLAINED THAT NUMBER OF BACKLOGGED APPLICATIONS BASICALLY CHANGES ON A DAILY BASES AS NEW APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED. AND WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS EVERY MONTH WITH -- I'LL BUT HAVE WITH THE DIS CREASE IT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN STAFF. OTHER ARISTIDE TO FUNDING FOR TWELVE POSITIONS AND FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN TWENTY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- ALL THIRTY TWO POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY FILLED BUT THEY DO HAVE LIMITED TIME FUNDING THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. SO THAT IS A CONCERN ABOUT. IF FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED THE BUREAU MAY LOSE STAFF NEXT YEAR IN THE BACK WHILE WILL THEN ONCE AGAIN INCREASED. RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF ARE MAKING PROGRESS. AND EVEN WITH LIMITED TERM FUNDING. DEBILITY TO RETAIN STAFF MAY BE DIFFICULT -- AND JUST SAY NO THE THE EXPERIENCING TRAINED STAFF USUALLY WORK ON THE MORE COMPLICATED MARK TIME CONSUMING INVESTIGATIONS. SO WHEN STAFF GO OUT IT'S A PROCESS OF HIRING RETRAINING GETTING THEM EXPERIENCE SO THEY CAN HANDLE THEM [inaudible] ONCE -- BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE AND THE CARBON INDUSTRY WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE ALWAYS MINDFUL ABOUT RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUN. AND HOW WE SPENT THAT MONEY AS WELL AS A SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND WHICH IS -- MONEY THAT TRIBES PAY INTO -- ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE AUDITOR CLASSES THAT THE DOJ MAYBE USING EMPLOYEES FROM THAT FROM THE GALA CONTROL FUND FOR OTHER PURPOSES OKAY LET ME LET ME AGAIN NOW. YOU KNOW I I WANT TO GIVE YOU AYE AYE A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THE AUDIT REQUESTS BUT WERE NOT THE FACT FINDING BODY THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ALLEGATION WHAT IS THE RESPONSE SOARED -- DEFENSE BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IN MIND HOW THIS IS RELEVANT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD APPROVED PROVE THIS AUDIT REQUEST YOU'RE NOT SURE AND I WAS THEM. I APOLOGIZE I WAS JUST THERE ARE SOME THAT STATEMENT CENTER THAT I FELT LIKE WE HAD TO ADDRESS BECAUSE WE FELT THERE AN INACCURATE OR GET PROVIDE THE FULL. ON INFORMATION AND AND PERHAPS I MEAN IF THIS -- WHO WHAT WHEN THE POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE COURSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS AT? AN AUDIT IS IS YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE PUNITIVE BUT A MAY -- ESTABLISH THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT THAT THERE ARE. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE AUDITOR DOES NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF A DISPARATE TREATMENT OR DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT THAN THAT WOULD BE EVIDENCE THAT AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S REVIEW RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR DOES CAMPBELL AT IT DOES. COVER A WHOLE A NUMBER OF ISSUES SO THAT WAS KINDA CONCERNING THING THAT IN A PRIOR TO THIS WE HAD THE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SIT DOWN. AND COME TO DISCUSS SOME OTHER THINGS -- PROVIDE SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION SO THAT WAS SOMETHING WE HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH THE REQUEST YEARS BOTH THEM SILLY MEMBERS BONTA CHIU WHERE. THEY'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSING SO -- REQUESTING THAT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WE'VE JUST HEARD -- HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE BEEN CLARIFIED MAYBE NARROW THE SCOPE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT SOME OF THE THINGS PROBABLY. IT. IT'S JUST BASED ON THE PERSON IN ACCURATE INFORMATION -- SO BUT YOU KNOW WELL WE DISPUTE THE NEED FOR THE AUDIT OBVIOUSLY IF -- IF NOT IS APPROVED WE WILL COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE MAKE SURE THAT HER STAFF HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO COMPLETE THE AUDIT. ARAFAT GIVEN QUESTIONS THANK YOU OF BEFORE GOING FOR THEIR AN AND OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE -- MISTER BONTA AYE I KNOW IS MY TO TO MEET WITH THE SPAWNING AGENCIES -- IS IS IT STILL YOUR POSITION THAT TO YOU LIKE PROCEED WITH THE REQUEST AS STATED IN OUR AND YOUR WRITTEN REQUEST HIDEOUS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT WE HAD A GOOD MEETING AS AS WAS DESCRIBED -- AS ALWAYS WE WE ARE OPEN TO AND NOT JUST PASSIVELY OPEN TO WE WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. I TO HELP RESOLVE THE THE ISSUE I INVITED AT A SORT OF A TWO TRACK APPROACH WEEK YOU CONVERSATION IF WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS FANTASTIC. BUT HE GOT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- THAT THERE WERE SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS SOME OF IN. THURMOND FORMAL COMPLAINTS MADE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- FOR IT FOR OTHERS AYE I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE TO BE ON THE COMMISSION COMING FROM BECAUSE THE SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE MADE THE ALLEGATIONS FEAR RETALIATION. AND SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHARE -- AT A COMPLETE SET OF OF ALLEGATIONS BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT VETTING WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT THE AUDIT WHERE IF THE CONFIDENTIALITY TO BE PROTECTED IT COULD BE. AYE WEATHER CAN BE FULL VETTING AND THE FACTS AND I'M AND I AGREE WITH YOU OF EVERYTHING. AYE THAT'S BEEN SAID -- BY SOME THE OPPOSITION IS TRUE THEN AND THAT WOULD BE DEFINITIVELY STATED IN THE AUDIT BUT NOW THAT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT BEEN RAISED ARE DISTURBING IN CONCERNING -- IN A NUMBER OF WAYS -- IT WOULD ALSO THE FINDINGS THAT ALSO HELP GUIDE WHAT WE CAN DO IS THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSIST WITH THE ONGOING REDUCTION OF THE BACKLOG WHICH IS SOMEWHAT HELP WITH -- BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES. I WE ARE STILL -- SEEKING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AUDIT TODAY MISTER CHAIR ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS BAKER. THINK YEAH IT DOES THIS POINT IS I I REALLY DO. I HEAR FROM YOU THAT AND AND ALSO FROM THE OTHER SIDE THAT THE MEETING THIS HAPPENS BUT WHAT. WELL DID DID THE OF DEPARTMENTS. REFUSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION -- THIS IS FOR THE REQUESTER AT MISRATA IT DEBATE TODAY SAID THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION WAS THEIR REQUEST. USUALLY IT'S IT'S IDEAL IF THAT OPTION HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES A YEAR. OF BACK AND FORTH YOU GET THE INFORMATION I'M IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A BETTER SENSE OF JUST HOW MUCH THAT OPTION IT'S BEEN EXHAUSTED AND WHAT THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH. THAT CAN ONLY COME FROM THE AUDIT BEFORE RESCIND THE AUDITOR WHO'S TESTIFIED TO US THAT. SHE HAS ROOM FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AUDITSBETWEEN NOW AND AND SEVERAL MONTHS OUT. INCLUDING ONE THAT COULD TAKE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE SO I'M CAN YOU SHARE THE BUT MORE INFORMATION OUT THAT YES I DO MY BEST. THIS AND AND SOME OF THIS IS NOT PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND I GOT INVOLVED WHEN A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BEER ON THE COMMISSION CAME TO US WITH WITH CONCERNS AND WE SHARED WITH US. THAT THERE HAD BEEN MULTIPLE REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AYE WHICH WOULD OR NOT RESPONDED. TO THERE WERE MEETINGS THAT DIDN'T LEAD TO SOLUTIONS. I THOUGHT THERE WERE ACTUAL FORMAL FORMAL -- COMPLAINTS THAT WERE MADE INCLUDING TO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS WITH WITH THAT IDEA J. THAT DID NOT LEAD TO A SOLUTION. SO IT WAS SHARED WITH US THAT THAT INTERIM STEPS OUT TO WORK DIRECTLY. WITH THE COMMISSION WITH THE BUREAU HAD BEEN TAKEN THAT DIDN'T LEAD TO A AT ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS OR RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IN FACT IN SOME CASES IT GOT WORSE -- WAS SHARED WITH US THAT RETALIATION ENSUED AND ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY THAT WASN'T THERE AND IN THE BEGINNING OCCURRED AFTER -- CONCERNS WERE RAISED AND ALL THAT WAS A RED FLAG FOR US WHERE WE SAID LET'S HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT LET'S GET ALL THE FACTS OUT THERE. AND AND AND SEE SO I DON'T HAVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT PIERRE A REQUEST FOR THE RECORD REQUEST EVER MADE WAS SHARED WITH US THAT THEY WERE MADE AND THEY WEREN'T RESPONDED. TO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT IS WHAT IN FROM STEPS WERE TAKEN. BEFORE I WE GOT TO THIS AUDIT AND FOR IT IS A MEMBER CHIU AND I WE THOUGHT THE AUDIT WAS WAS THE TOOL THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOLBOX TO ASSIST. WITH A SET OF ISSUES THAT WEREN'T BEING RESOLVED THROUGH OTHER INTROVERTS GOT I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE THE NIGHT AND IT WASN'T CLEAR ON THAT FROM BEFORE. WHICH I WAS I WAS REFER LIB ORDER WHAT YOUR OFFICES DOWN TO REQUEST INFORMATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHAT WE SAY TO FOLKS COME WITHIN WITH A REQUEST IS. HAVE YOU AS A AS YOUR OFFICE BEEN ABLE TO EXHAUST THAT OPTION. AND HAVE HAVE THEY NOT PROVIDED YOU WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THAT YOU'RE OUR INFORMATION TO YOUR SATISFACTION -- WHAT I'M JUST GETTING CLARIFICATION ON AND THANK YOU IS THAT? CONSTITUENTS CAME FORWARD TO YOU AND SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION -- BUT BEFORE WE SEND THE AUDITOR USUALLY HAVE I JUST AM CURIOUS HOW MUCH THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE TO WORKING TOGETHER [inaudible] GET THAT BEFORE WE SEND THE AUDITOR -- PACKAGE HAS YOUR OFFICE HAD IT NOT HAVE THEY SAID NO TO REQUEST OF YOUR OFFICE FOR INFORMATION. TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD YOU. AS A MEMBER CHIU AND I MADE AN AUDIT REQUEST WE DIDN'T. PROPOUND THAT REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS OR MAKE ANY REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS OR INFORMATION THE OPPONENTS. WITH THEM THIS IS NOT CONSENT UNTIL RECENTLY -- THE PARENTS ASKED ME WITH US AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE WITH THEM SO WE GET. OUR BUT THERE WAS NO REPORT REQUEST FOR FOR DOCUMENTS THAT WERE MADE.
