HOWEVER THROUGH WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE AGREED TO TAKE A MOMENT THAT WE TRANSACTION FEES ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS THAT WILL PROTECT LOW INCOME. CUSTOMERS FROM ANY SOCIALIST COST RECOVERY BY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY- WITH THE CLASS AND I WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM ANY MEMBERS IN SUPPORT- ANY ACTIVE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES ASSEMBLYMEMBER. OKAY SO WE WOULD THEN ASK FOR ANYBODY SPEAKING IN THE ROOM. ONE TWELVE I SEE NO ONE- IF WE COULD GO TO THE PHONE LINE MODERATOR. ANY PEOPLE WHICH I'M SURE YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE EVAN JACOBS ON THE LINE AND SUPPORT OKAY CAN WE PLEASE HEAR FROM MR JACOBSON. MR TAKEN FIVE HUNDRED. HELLO EVAN JACOBS- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WHICH IS SPONSORING THE LEGISLATION WE REPRESENT NINETY FOUR PC REGULATED WATER UTILITIES AROUND THE STATE WE PROVIDE WATER SERVICE ABOUT 16% OF RESIDENTS WHO SAY THE CALIFORNIA AND HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF MAYBE TEN FIFTY EIGHT. THAT REALLY CROSS ABOUT USING TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE BILL PAYMENTS EASIER SAFER AND MORE CONVENIENT HI- WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION SIMILAR LEGISLATION ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO BUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS CONVERSATION UPON FROM TALKING UP MAKING BILL PAYMENTS EASIER TO MAKING THEM SAFER- IN THIS YEAR OF COKE THAT GETS REALLY PART OF IT NOW PRESS LOG PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN AS WELL AS IN THE ISUE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT. CONVENIENCE- LIKE CAME IN TO REACH PART OF OUR BUSINESS WE ALL THE SMALL FORMS OF PAYMENT TO CRASH TO BANK ACCOUNT WITHDRAWAL. THE ONLY FOR PAYMENT HAVE A DISH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM BORN- USING THE OF COURSE. BLACK CHRONIC PAIN CREDIT DEBT CARD SO WE NEED TO THE TREE OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT SIMILAR. AND I'M PLEASED WITH THE AMENDMENTS WILL TAKE AND THAT PROVIDES A GREATER LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. WE'RE TOLD MY REPAIR SYSTEMS PROGRAMS SO- I. THANK ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS AND- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I UNDERSTAND WE ALSO HAVE MR PERATIS. ON THE PHONE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. THE GOOD UP. MY NAME IS JOHN GRANDE AND I AM EMPLOYED BY GOLDEN STATE WATER COMPANY A KEY PC REGULATED WATER UTILITY. AND THE MANAGER OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS- I'M PROVIDING TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON IN SUPPORT OF BABY TEN FIFTY EIGHT WE CAN MAKE PERMANENT A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW. WATER UTILITIES TO WAIVE THE TRANSACTION FEE FOR CUSTOMERS PAYING BY CREDIT CARD DEBIT CARD AND PREPAID CARD. AND ALLOW WATER UTILITIES TO RECOVER THE COST OF OPERATING THIS PROGRAM FROM ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS EXCLUDING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. GOING TO A WATER COMPANY SUPPORTS THIS BILL BECAUSE ACCEPTING CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TO THE FORM OF PAYMENT. IS A BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTION OF ANY MAJOR BUSINESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE WHY A CUSTOMER WOULD WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONVENIENCE AND SECURITY. A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD PROVIDED. GOLDEN STATE BEGAN A PILOT PROGRAM TO FUND THE COST OF CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN. GENERATING POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. GIVEN THE IMPACT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN TWENTY TWENTY IN THE SHORT DURATION OF THE TIME THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE. GOLDEN STATE HAS NOT HAD A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO QUANTIFY THE MANY CUSTOMER BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PILOT PROGRAM. HOWEVER FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN THE TOTAL PAYMENT MADE BY COHEN A CUSTOMER USING CREDIT CARD DEBIT CARD OR ELECTRONIC CHECK SERVICES. INCREASED AT AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THE CONTINUED WAIVER OF TRANSACTION FEES WILL GENERATE MORE DESIRE ON GOLDEN STATE CUSTOMERS CARD. HE USED THE PAYMENT OPTION DESCRIBED IN MAYBE TEN FIFTY EIGHT. IN CLOSING I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT A BABY TEN FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATE OR ANYBODY. ELSE IN THE QUEUE WISHING TO GIVE THEIR SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF A. B. TEN FIFTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYBODY IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SAYING NOBODY- MODERATOR AND ASK YOU IF THERE'S ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINE. WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO AB. TEN FIFTY EIGHT. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN FIFTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE. AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE B. TEN FIFTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ENTER. WE HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD. TURN IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ON THIS BILL SENATOR GROVE YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM THROUGH THE CHAIR- THIS PILOT PROGRAM STARTED WHEN DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION MA'AM. SIX YEARS AGO AND I CARRIED THAT US WELL OKAY AND WITHIN THAT SIX YEARS DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATED DOLLAR AMOUNT OF WHAT THE FEES WERE. NOT THE ACTUAL BILL ITSELF- BUT THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILLS. I DO NOT. THE BILL IS PASSED IT WAS IMPLEMENTED A YEAR LATER AND THEN BECAUSE OF CODE WITH SOME OF THE DATA COLLECTION WAS ALSO AFFECTED. NINE OKAY SO JUST JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT I REALLY DO- AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S MIND IS ALL ONLINE SOME OF ITGOES TO A CREDIT CARD ACTUALLY A LOT OF IT DOES BECAUSE WE GET CABALLOS POINTS AND- MY HUSBAND'S FAVORITE PLACE TO SHOP. AND BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE FEES I'M JUST UNSURE WHO'S GOING TO PAY THE CREDIT CARD FEES THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN. THERE'S ALSO LIFE AMONG ALL CUSTOMERS THAT CALLED LIKE ANY OTHER FEES THAT MIGHT OF NORMALLY HAVE HAPPENED FOR. ANY OTHER BILL PAYMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE CARE CUSTOMERS TO REALIGN COME. YOU WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM ANY OF THESE COSTS. IT WOULD JUST BE A LIKE A- SPREAD OVER ALL CUSTOMERS PLEASE AND THAT PAY BILLS REGARDLESS IF THEY USE THAT. CREDIT CARD PAYMENT OR NOT CORRECT THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IF YOU MAIL IN A CHECK THAT'S IF YOU DO A PHONE. PAYMENT AT LEAST AT THOSE THOSE PAYMENTS OUT ACROSS EVERYBODY CURRENTLY AS WELL. AND YOU DON'T KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH THOSE FEES ARE THOUGH I MEAN ARE WE TALKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DO YOU THINK THREE TOPPING. MILLION YOU KNOW LIKE HOW MUCH IS GOING TO HELP MY CONCERN IS I GUESS IS THE RATE INCREASES. FOR THESE- THESE TRANSACTION FEES. CAN I AN INSIGHT ON HOW THE DATA BUT I WILL SAY THIS- MORE AND MORE OF OUR CONSUMERS ARE EXPECTING TO DO THIS ONLINE AND IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER FOR. ONLINE THAN TO. WALK INTO A FACILITY OR TO WRITE A CHECK AND HAVE THAT PROCESS. SO AS WE ARE MOVING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER I WOULD I. SYSTEM THAT WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE SOME SAVINGS HERE. I WOULD AND I WOULD ALSO ASK I KNOW YOU HAVE A WITNESS IS ON IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER AND I THINK THE STUDY YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THAT CPUC STUDY THAT. AGAIN IT WAS HARD TO LOOK AT THE DATA BECAUSE- OF CODE AND EVERYTHING- BUT I THINK WOULD BE ASSUMING THEY WERE SAYING TO SOCIALIZE ACROSS EVERYBODY AND THE REPORT I SAW I THOUGHT MAYBE EVERYBODY'S WOULD GO UP ABOUT FIFTY CENTS- BUT THEY- THEY WEREN'T QUITE SURE AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE DATE IS NOT QUITE RIGHT. I WOULD I WOULD KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO ANOTHER-COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE AND SO THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR IT THERE AS WELL- AND- I BELIEVE THAT WE DONE SOME REMEMBER- I'M SORRY TO DO. HE WAS A WITNESS IS GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT- IN. IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR THE CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL EVERYBODY'S BILL BE RAISED. AND HOW MUCH ARE THE FINES CURRENTLY THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING WHEN THEY USE- AT THIS MOMENT. TRANSACTION. TO TAKE OUT A READER HAS. DIFFERENT DREAMS MIGHT MIGHT. HELLO RIGHT NOW. SEVEN JACOBS ARE DRAWN FOR IT YOU. EVAN JACOBS OKAY CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION MISTER JACOBS. I THANK THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT SOME TO. EVERY EVERY COMPANY HAS CLEARLY DIFFERENT JEEZ MY COMPANY CHARGES A DOLLAR NINETY FIVE GENERALLY PREACH CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS ACTUALLY CHARGED WITH THIRD PARTY PROCESSOR- BUT CERTAINLY MEMBER GARCIA'S CORRECT EVERY FORM OF PAYMENT HAVE SOME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. PERHAPS BY FAR AND AWAY THE LARGEST PARKS ARE PEOPLE WALKING IN WITH CASH BECAUSE OF- THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SECURITY. CHECKS YOU NEED ON HANDLING CASH CASES ARE MOST EXPENSIVE FORM OF PAYMENT SO WE EXPECT SOME COST SHIFTING THAT OCCURRED HERE AND WHAT YOU KNOW. GENERATING COST SAVINGS WE ALSO GOING TO BE SOME OTHER BENEFITS TO IT I THINK THE PC REPORT WAS VERY CONSERVATIVE THAT UP TO FIFTY CENTS. PER BILL PER CUSTOMERI MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL GENERATE MORE SAVINGS- INVOLVED AFTER YOU CLICK ON THE PAYMENTS AND HAVE AN ACTUAL LOWER IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS- HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOURQUESTION HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYTHING ELSE. IT DOES I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO GO BECAUSE YOU KNOW. LIKE I SAID ALMOST EVERYTHING IS ONLINE AND IN YOU PAY BY CREDIT CARD OR OR JUST TO HAVE BEEN LOWER THINGS LIKE THAT I JUST HAD A CONCERN YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS PAY THE HIGHEST UTILITY AND ENERGY RATES ALMOST IN THE NATION AND I JUST HAD A CONCERN ABOUT AN- EVEN ADDITIONAL FIFTY CENTS. AND TO THOSE COST AND BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE- WHERE THE AUTHOR IS GOING WITH THIS BILL SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING. ME TO ANSWER THAT- ASKED THAT QUESTION. VERY MUCH I WE A CENTER DOT WISHING TO BE BACK. IN THEN AFTER THAT CENTERED. YEAH I JUST ONE TO SPEAK THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT BUSINESS DOES. HE IN ANY. OUT THERE IS. PROCESSING CREDIT CARDS IN YOU KNOW IT IS IT A BURDEN SOMETIMES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS- TO BE CHARGING YOUR PEOPLE BACK. YOUR DOOR DIRECTLY AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES TAKE STATE LEGISLATION TO GET THAT DONE. EVEN ON THE COUNTY LEVEL SOME MIGHT TRY TO GET DONE IN. IN NAPA COUNTY- FOR MANY YEARS AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S MORE OF THIS WILL HELP BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES IT EASIER. FOR CONSUMERS TO PAY IT'S MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSUMER MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THIS SIDE- I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT CENTRE DELHI. I JUST LIKE TO ADD ON TO IT I THINK I RECALL IN THE SILLY WOMAN BROUGHT HER BILL BEFORE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A SAVINGS IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE THE CHECK BUY A STAMP. THEN SOMEBODY PROCESS ON THE OTHER END THE RETAILERS ACTUALLY SAVINGS EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A COST SHIFT TO IT OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE A SAVINGS AND SO WILL I HI I BELIEVE I SUPPORTED THE STUDY BILL AND I KNOW WE DID GET THE INFORMATION BUT- THOSE OF US IN BUSINESS NO IT TAKES MORE TIME TO PROCESS AND HOURS AND IN THE- PERSONNEL. THAT IT DOES IT JUST TRANSFER THE MONEY STRAIGHT TO THE CHECKING ACCOUNT SO FOR THOSE REASONS- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THIRTY DOES A MOTION CENTER. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW. A SPOKESWOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD THE M.

IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE AND WE DID A LOT OF WORK IN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY ENSURING THAT LARGER RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS ARE ABLE TO TAP INTO THIS. VERY SIMPLY THIS IS WHERE KIDS GO AFTER SCHOOL. WHEN THEY'RE GONE AND AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
