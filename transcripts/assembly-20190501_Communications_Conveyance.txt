WOULD LIKE TO START AS OF SUBCOMMITTEE IF THE SERGEANTS RECALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS. AND ALSO LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT -- MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE WILL BE ABSENT FROM TODAY'S HEARING. WOULD LIKE TO A THIS CALL YOU WILL BEGIN. S. AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. ONE SIXTY TWO THIS IS A BILL TO KEEP TEXTING TAX FREE IN CALIFORNIA IT HAS TWENTY FIVE CO AUTHORS WHICH IS THE THIRD MOST OF ANY BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. AB ONE SIXTY TWO PROHIBITS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FROM COLLECTING ANY UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND REVENUES OR UTILITY REIMBURSEMENT FEES DERIVE FROM CHARGES ON COMMUNICATION SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS AN INFORMATION SERVICE BY THE FCC. THE CPUC ALREADY COLLECT THE SURCHARGE ON WIRELESS LAN LINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN ORDER TO FUND THE STATE'S UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND WHICH INCLUDES A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. A RECENT PROPOSAL BY THE CQC WOULD HAVE EXTENDED THAT SURCHARGE TO TEXT MESSAGING. BUT IT WAS WITHDRAWN AFTER THE FCC ISSUED THE DECLARATORY RULING WHICH CLASSIFIED TEXT MESSAGING WHICH IS CREE THE PREVIOUSLY ON CLASSIFIED AS AN INFORMATION SERVICE. NOW DESPITE THE NEW CLASSIFICATION. PROPONENTS OF THE TAX TAX DON'T SEEM TO AGREE THAT THE STATE IS PREEMPTED FROM REGULATING INFORMATION SERVICES. AND WOULD STILL LIKE THE TAX TAX PROPOSAL TO MOVE FORWARD. TEXT MESSAGING AS WE'RE ALL AWARE HAS BECOME INTEGRAL TO MODERN COMMUNICATION ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. STATE POLICIES OF ALREADY MADE CALIFORNIA UNAFFORDABLE FOR FAR TOO MANY. AND BECOMING THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION THE TAX TAXING WOULD ONLY MAKE OUR AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM WORSE. AB ONE SIXTY TWO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE CEASE BE YOU SEE IS PROHIBITED PROHIBITED FROM UNILATERALLY EXTENDING TAXES FEES AND SURCHARGES TO ANY COMMUNICATION SERVICE THAT THE FCC IS CLASSIFIED. AS AN INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH NOW INCLUDES TAX MESSAGES. I HAVE WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON DAY BY DAY BUT WERE FROM THE UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK IN SUPPORT.

OF PAUL GOODMAN HERE -- WHO'S WITH I'M THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE HE SAID I'D AGREE THIS FCC DECISION COMPLICATES THINGS BUT I DON'T THINK IT ELIMINATES THE P. UC'S ABILITY. TO IMPOSE THAT YOU ALSO HAVE MANY SPAT WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK -- SAID NOTHING THE FCC HAS DONE PRESENT PREVENTS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AND SO THERE. IS STILL AN ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF ADVOCATES FOR THE TEXT TAX THAT ACTUALLY EXISTING STATE LAW. PROVIDES A FORTY PURSUANT TO WHICH THE S. P. YOU SEE COULD IMPOSE THIS TAX NOW WITH MY IMPRESSION FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE TWENTY FIVE CO AUTHORS OF THE BILL THAT IS NOT THE SENTIMENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE THAT WE DO NOT. WANT TEXT MESSAGING TO BE TAXED AND SO THIS BILL IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT SENTIMENT IS EXPRESSED IN A LAW AND PREVENTING -- THE SET PC FROM IMPOSING THE TAX IN THE FUTURE.
