WE'RE GONNA BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY'S HEARING OF COURSE IS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- PORTION OF THE BUDGET PROCESS TODAY. WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE FUNDING FORMULA OTHER PROMISE PROGRAMS A CAPITAL OUTLAY ONLINE A COLLEGE AS WELL AS THAT BASIC NEEDS. OUT WE WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IT'S OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OF THE WORK COURSE OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE EARLY JANUARY BUDGET PROVIDE A GOOD STARTING POINT -- FOR BASIC FUNDING FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- NOT NOT A LOT OF EXTRAS THAT WE HAD IN THE PRIOR YEARS WE HAVE A FEW PROGRAMS WE WANT -- TO GO OVER THAT WE HAD -- FUNDED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER -- ONE FUNDING FORMULA IN APARTMENTS [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. YES AND WERE INTEGRAL TO QUICK MCCARTY [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] BRO [inaudible] MEDINA [inaudible] O'DONNELL. QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED OKAY PLEASE PROCEED OKAY. THE MORNING CHAIR IN MEMBERS MICHELLE NEW IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. IN ADDITION TO ENROLLMENT THE FORMULA ALLOCATES GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BASED ON ADDITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENROLLED. AND SPECIFIED STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS SUCH AS THE COMPLETION OF A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON TOTAL ENROLLMENT. 20% ON ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND 10% ON STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SOME REVISIONS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. FOR THE FORMULA. SPECIFICALLY IT MAINTAINING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RATES FROM FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA INTO. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY CAPPING YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION AT 10%. AND CLARIFYING THAT THE DEFINITION OF TRANSFERS SHOULD REFLECT AN UNDUE BLOCKADED COUNT OF STUDENTS. THESE REVISIONS WERE PROPOSED TO ADDRESS ISSUES REGARDING ANOMALIES IN THE DATA FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS AND SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS ALSO INTENDED TO GIVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO ADDRESS THE FORMULAS LONG TERM. FISCAL STABILITY AND IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF DATA REPORTED BY DISTRICTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ABORTION MINTS INCLUDING TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF POINT 55%. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR A THREE POINT THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. CAN. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS AT GROUP BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MOTOR COVER TWO ISSUES -- RELATED TO PORTIONS HERE FIRST IS AN ISSUE THAT'S IN YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS RELATED TO A PENCIL SHORTFALL IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ANOTHER THERE ARE A COUPLE VERY ABLE ESTIMATES OF THE SHORTFALL BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- MAYBE A DECISION FOR YOU -- COME MAY -- IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSED TO THE BACK WHAT SHORTFALL AT THE ME REVISION -- WILL BE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE WANT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND TO BACK FOR THAT. THE PROVIDING SOME FUNDING TO BAFFLE THAT SHORTFALL MIGHT BE -- SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT YOU'RE SINGLING SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA AND FOR THE CONCERNED WITH IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE YEAR WHEN THERE ARE MORE LIMITED PROP AND YET RESOURCES AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS -- THAT IS FEASIBLE THIS YEAR I'M IF YOU DO -- DECIDE NOT TO BACK FOR THE SHORTFALL IN QUESTION WILL BE HOW THAT -- SHORTFALL IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE CHANCES OFFICES HAVE INDICATED THEIR PREFERENCES TO ASSURE COLLEGES THAT THEY WOULD BE RECEIVING AT LEAST SEVENTY NINETEEN PLUS COLA -- SO THAT THERE IS SOME OF THE DISTRICT THAT DIDN'T GET AS MUCH UNDER THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA WOULDN'T TAKE -- MUCH OF THE THE CARD WE THINK THIS APPROACH -- SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THERE WAS A PRETTY BIG VERY ABILITY AND THE YEAR TO YEAR INCREASES THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVED UNDER THE NEW FORMULA. I'M THE NEXT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE TWO PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY A BUDGET AND AND OUR THAT'S BEEN A RECOMMENDATIONS HERE. I'M SO FIRST ON THE PROPOSAL TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE DELAY THE INCREASE IN THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION -- WE DO THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE APPROACH -- WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME AT THE TO ISSUES FOR THE STATE TO WORK OUT -- WE HAVE A THERE'S A CHART ON PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA THAT COMES FROM OUR ANALYSIS -- WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT JUST THE LAST TEN YEARS OF -- THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATE DEGREES -- AWARDED -- STATEWIDE AND AT VARIOUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE THE DATA LOOK SIMILAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT CERTIFICATES BUT WE DO SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT VARIATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- AND THERE THERE'S NOT A CLEAR EXACT ONE ANSWER FOR WHY THAT'S THE CASE -- WE DO THINK THAT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF A RELIABILITY ACCURACY OF THE DATA ARE IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW THAT THE CHANCES OFFICES INDICATED THEY'RE GONNA TAKE SEVERAL STEPS -- TO TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES I'M IN TALKING TO SOME DISTRICTS ARE WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL -- THERE MIGHT BE VERY VERY XIN IN THE STATE I EVEN IF YOU TO DEAL WITH SORT OF THE DATA RELIABILITY ISSUES. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DISTRICTS GOING THROUGH SPECIFIC LOCAL ISSUES LIKE CHANGES IN IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY OR CHANGES THEN FOR EXAMPLE -- THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED BY US YES USE IN THEIR LOCAL AREA THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR YOUR TO YOUR OUTCOMES -- SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU -- IT CHANGE THE THING SIX ALLOCATION SO THAT RATHER THAN BEING DRIVEN BY ONE YEAR'S WORTH ROCKING DATA IT'S A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT CONSISTENT WITH THE BASE ALLOCATION WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE OF ENROLLMENT. THAT WE THINK WILL HELP WITH STABILITY FOR BOTH -- DISTRICTS BUT ALSO FOR THE STATE AND PROJECTING WITH A FUNDING WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. I'M ON THE SECOND ISSUE THAT THERE ARE SECOND PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELATED TO ARE PUTTING A 10% CAP ON THE YEAR TO YEAR GROWTH IN THE STUDENT SUCCESS OKAY. WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT PROPOSAL I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT IS IT WE APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT CONTAINING COSTS IN THE FORMULA BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT APPROACH. IS THAT COULD APPROACH THAT COULD REDUCE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR SOME DISTRICTS ARE ACTUALLY MAKING NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONSIDERING OTHER ALTERNATIVES -- THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME -- CONTROLLING COSTS AND AVOIDING SOME OF THE SORT OF NEGATIVE INSTANCES WE MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- ONE PARTICULAR -- THEIR NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD DO THIS THE ONE SPECIFIC OPERA SO WE RECOMMEND IS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF OUTCOME BASED FUNDING THAT COMES FROM. THE COME FROM ANY INDIVIDUAL STUDENT IN ANY YEAR -- SO FOR EXAMPLE STUDENT WHO EARNED AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE -- AND THE CERTIFICATE THE DISTRICT ONLY GET FUNDING FOR THAT ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND WE THINK THAT THE APPROACH THAT -- CONTINUES TO STILL GIVE DISTRICT INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS WILL REMOVE THAT NEGATIVE INCENTIVE TO SORT OF TAKE STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY COMPLETING ADDING AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES. I WOULD THINK THAT APPROACH WOULD WOULD REDUCE COSTS IN A WAY THAT I STILL HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES FOR IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS MORE BROADLY. I'M SO STOPPED THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. CHRISTIAN LAST MINUTE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- I'M GONNA BE WORKING OFF OF THIS HANDOUT -- IT'LL START ON PAGE TWO MUCH OF WHAT. WE INCLUDING THE HEAD OUT HIS BEEN COVERED BY -- SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS SO I WILL MOVE QUICKLY -- BUT ON THE TOP OF PAGE TWO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AS WE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE FUNDING FORMULA LAST YEAR AND AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT AND THINK THROUGH -- POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE FORMULA WE'RE GUIDED BY A SET OF THREE PRINCIPLES ONE THE GOAL OF ENCOURAGING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS WHICH HAS A NORTH STAR. OF CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS -- EQUITY GAPS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SECOND TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WHO HAVE FACED ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. PRINCIPALLY. STUDENTS FROM LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET THE GOALS AND THIRD TO MAKE THESE RESOURCES FLEXIBLE AND PREDICTABLE -- AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO HAS THE STRUCTURE OF THE FORMULA THAT'S BEEN COVERED SO I MOVED TO THE TOP OF PAGE. THREE AND JUST. THE AGENDA NOTED SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF POINTS UNDER THE FORMULA. SO I THINK YOU CAN AND FOR THREE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE THE POINTS WERE DESIGNED FIRST -- PARTICULARLY AS PART OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION FIRST -- DIFFERENCES IN COST BASED ON DIFFERENCES OF LIKE THE PROGRAM. SECOND OF THE ADDED COSTS THE DISTRICT MIGHT INCUR TOWARDS INCREMENTAL PROGRESS TOWARD NOW COME. IN THIRD A CLEAR INTENT TO CREATE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AROUND PARTICULAR OUTCOMES I THINK THIS IS MOST PROMINENT -- IN THE ADDITIONAL POINTS THAT ARE AWARDED FOR A COMPLETION OF AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- THREE I WOULD JUST KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED YET ABOUT THE FUNDING STABILITY PROVISIONS CLEARLY A A GOAL OF THIS FORMULA WAS TO MAKE OVER TIME -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING MORE STABLE -- THE FORMULA INCLUDES A SET OF TESTS THAT DEFINE HOW MUCH A DISTRICT WOULD RECEIVE IN A GIVEN YEAR FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO DISTRICT AS THE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS NOTED. WOULD RECEIVE AT LEAST THERE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN READ REVENUES ADJUSTED BY THE CHANGES IN THE COST OF LIVING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE SEE IT SORT OF TEST THAT COMPARE WHAT A DISTRICT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED. UNDER THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA IN THE CURRENT YEAR WITH WHAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND WE FUND THEM AT LEAST AT THE HIGHER OF THE TWO MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR I WOULD JUST KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A SPLIT OF SEVENTY TWENTY TEN WHAT. WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE BASE ALLOCATION WOULD REPRESENT STATEWIDE ABOUT 70% OF FUNDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION 20% THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF THE FUNDING FORMULA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT YOU SEE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES OUTPUT ALLOCATED TOWARDS THE BASE ALLOCATION -- AND THAT THE SHARES DECLINING RAPIDLY BEYOND THAT. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- FOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR ENACTED THE FUNDING FOR THE LAST YEAR. OF THE INCLUDED PROVISIONS AROUND LOCAL GOAL SETTING PLANNING AND AND BUDGETING WITH THE INTENT THAT DISTRICTS AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO THE NEW INCENTIVES. ARE HAVING A SET OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES ABOUT. HOW THOSE DOLLARS WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SPECIFICALLY THE DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THIS ACADEMIC YEAR? TO ADOPT GOALS THAT ARE ALLIED WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD WE EXPECT AVOID OP COMPREHENSIVE PLANS EDUCATIONAL PLANTS THAT ALLIED WITH THOSE GOALS AND OTHER BUDGETS WOULD BE ALLIED WITH THOSE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS. I'M GOING TO MOVE TO THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S NOTE -- NOTES -- AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF THE COST OF THE FORMULA -- THE KERN APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THE FORMULA THERE'S TWO PRINCIPAL REASONS THE TOTAL -- DIFFERENCE SAID AVAILABLE RESOURCES IS -- THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR IN DOLLARS -- THE DIFFERENCE IS -- OR IN TWO PARTS ONE OF THE HIGHER COSTS OF THE FORMULA OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO WHAT WAS ESTIMATED WHAT THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED IN SHARED. THIS LARGELY HAS TO DEAL WITH BOTH INCREASES IN THE COST OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER THAN PROJECTED OUTCOMES A STUDENT OUTCOMES. AS WELL AS INCREASES IN THE COST OF THE HOLD HARMLESS THE REVENUES THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVED A TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAS HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS PROJECTED. AND THEREFORE THE HOLD HARMLESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS HIGHER. THE OTHER SOURCE OF THE DIFFERENCE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PROPERTY TAX. REVENUE COLLECTIONS THE WHAT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE IN THE IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO THE EXTENT ARE ASK WOULD BE TO THE EXTENT THAT PROPERTY TAXES DON'T INCREASE -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSISTED WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BACK FILL THE FUNDS HOW TO ELIMINATE THAT PORTION OF THE DEFICIT. AS THE AS THE ANALYSTS NOTED -- IN COMMUNICATING THAT TO DISTRICTS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE EXPECTING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH AND SAID. AND LESS THAN THREE MONTHS WE'VE TOLD ALL DISTRICTS THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS OF THE FUNDINGFORMULA. DISTRICTS SHOULD EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEAST THERE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVENUES ADJUSTED BY THE CHANGES THINGS AND THE COST OF LIVING. ALL CLOSE ON PAGE -- SIX IN RESPONSE -- TO CONCERNS THE CHANCELLOR'S HAD CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS -- THE CHANCELLOR ASTON ADVISORY WORKGROUP ON FISCAL AFFAIRS TO LOOK AT SOME ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUNDING FORMULA AND TO ADVISE HIM ON AMENDMENTS. TO THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA -- INCLUDING FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY HAVING BROKEN THOSE ISSUES OUT INTO TWO CATEGORIES THE FIRST IS STRUCTURAL ISSUES. OTHER PROBABLY THREE QUESTIONS WERE LOOKING THEIR FIRST -- CONSISTENT WITH THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HOW SHOULD THE FORMULA CAN STRAIGHT YEAR TO YEAR INCREASES -- IN REVENUES ARE GIVEN THE STATE'S -- CONSTRAINTS AND REVENUES SECOND HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHAT DATA TO PULL FROM -- CURRENTLY THE FUNDING FORMULA USES PRIOR YEAR DATA -- FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION OF FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED GIVEN OUR DESIRE FOR MORE CERTAINTY THAT WE USE UP. EVEN -- PRIOR YEAR DATA -- TO TO CALCULATE DISTRICT APPORTIONMENT. AND THEN WHICH GROUPS OF STUDENTS ARE INTENDED TO BE SUPPORTED CURRENTLY -- WE'VE MADE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR OF MADE DECISIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS INCLUDING FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CREDIT STUDENTS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE SECOND SET OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION THE FIRST THE ALEJO MENTION ALREADY HOUSE OF THE FORMULAE COUNT FOR STUDENTS WHO ALL OCCURRED MORE THAN ONE AWARD IN A GIVEN YEAR. TO WATCH DISTRICTS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. A PROPOSAL SHOULD POST COLLEGE OUTCOMES LIKE TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION BE ATTRIBUTED. AND HOW MIGHT THE DEFINITIONS OF THESE MEASURES BETTER BE REFINED -- TO TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GOALS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND THEN FINALLY AS BOTH THE GOVERNOR HAS NOTED EMILIO -- REFERENCED -- THE CHANCELLOR IS INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE -- IT'S CONFIDENCE IN BOTH THE RELIED BILLION THE VALIDITY OF THE DATA THAT'S BEING USED IN THE FUNDING FORMULA. WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM TO REVIEW THE DATA AT A SUBSET OF COLLEGES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US. BASED ON COMMON PRACTICES AND BEST PRACTICES OF THE COLLEGES WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE A REPORT LATER THIS MONTH -- WITH THE GOAL THAT I COULD INFORM NEW POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND POTENTIAL OUT OF PROCEDURES. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE -- YEAH SORRY MR BROUGHT. THANK YOU MISTER QUESTION FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES COUPLE WEEKS AGO HAD SOME VETERANS STUDENTS HAVE SATELLITE COLLEGE IN MY DISTRICT -- THEY WERE INFORMING ME OF A A REQUEST FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS BUT THERE'S FIVE MILLION. IN YOUR PROPOSAL IS CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- THERE'S BEEN FUNDING IN PRIOR YEARS -- THERE'S NO FUNDING AND AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR CLASS -- AND NO FUNDING AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS CLEARLY A POPULATION THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS -- HAVING -- LIKELY BARRIERS TO SUCCESS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS PART OF OUR STUDENT EQUITY IN A TREATMENT PROGRAM A LARGE. PART OF FUNDS THAT COLLEGES HAVE AVAILABLE TO OUGHT TO ADDRESS EQUITY GAPS. VETERANS OF OURS ARE IDENTIFIED AS A CATEGORY OF STUDENTS THAT COLLEGES SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR A PARTICULAR SERVICES. TO ASSIST TWENTY MILLION FUNDED PREVIOUSLY BUT JUST NOT FUNNY NOW -- THERE -- THERE'S BEEN ONE TIME FUNDING IN RECENT YEARS. THE NUMBERS ARE ESCAPING ME AND I DON'T OF FINANCE -- THE LA AWESOME UP TOP MY THERE HAD IF YOU I THINK IT IS IF IT CAN GET BACK TO US ON THE AND IT AND IT'S CERTAINLY WE WE'VE RECEIVED THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE DID NOT INCLUDED IN OUR REQUEST GIVE IN -- BUT BROADER PHILOSOPHY THAT OUT COLLEGES SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR OF THE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST NAY FULLER CAUGHT UP THEIR CAMPUSES OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- A I REALIZE THE FUNDING FORMULAS NEW I'M NOT SURE. I HOPE WE'RE GONNA USE I STEPHEN DECATUR GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT AT THIS POINT -- WE'VE GOT A SHORT TOLD WHAT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION IS THAT CORRECT. BUT THAT'S A PROJECTION I WOULD SAY THINK -- PART OF THAT THE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION IS MORE -- BUT I THINK THEY'RE THERE FOR TWO DIFFERENT REASONS A LARGE TAX ISSUES FOR THE TAX ISSUES I THINK ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SO THAT'S A TWO AND IT WAS JUST. FOR FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE SO WHERE WOULD THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION COME FROM I MEAN THERE'S GOING FORWARD DO YOU WANT US TO GIVE THAT TO YOU. DO YOU UNIFIED THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN SYSTEM ARE YOU GONNA GO BACK AND RE BENCH WOULD YOU PROMISED PREVIOUSLY WOULD WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY. YES I WOULD SAY -- THERE I THINK THERE ARE THERE IS A CLEAR REQUEST FROM OUR OFFICE THAT THE STATE -- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL APPRPRIATIONS TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE FORMULA BUT WHATEVER THAT DEFICIT -- ULTIMATELY WOULD BE -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE HISTORIC PRACTICE OR THE PRACTICE OF THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN TO FIND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONSISTENT WITH THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE SO WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE ARE -- PLAYING IN A FIXED -- A LOT OF FUN SO I THINK -- YOU KNOW. IN TALKING WITH FOLKS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM I THINK THERE IS A HAVE A MUCH STRONGER MESSAGE THAT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE RESOURCES. OF THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF THE COLLEGES BUT IT BUT YES I THINK ULTIMATELY -- AT THE REQUEST AS THE STATE SHOULD BACK FILL OUT WHATEVER THE FORMULA COSTS AND MOVING FORWARD WE SHOULD IDENTIFY. HOW TO ADJUST THE FORMULA TO FIT WITHIN THE RESOURCE NEEDS THAT ARE -- REASONABLE FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE. THE RESOURCE IS MAYBE NOT EVEN THE RESOURCE -- I WOULD SAY THE RESOURCES BECAUSE THE NEED IS GREATER THAN OR ALLOCATING AYE AYE I CONCEDE THAT OUT OF THE GATE BUT GIVEN THE CONFINES WE HAVE WITH. K. FOURTEEN PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO MAKE IT A CEILING AS OPPOSED TO A FLOOR. AND THAT'S OUR DECISION AND I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT'S NOT ON AYE SUPPORT BUT IT IS IT IS A FACT. THAT THE DYNAMIC WE LIVE IN -- FOR THE JOB IN FOR A SECOND -- WE WE THINK THAT THE THAT THERE ARE A FEW EXPLANATIONS FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORTED CURRENT YEAR APPORTIONMENT SHORTFALL -- WITH. HISTORICAL TRENDS IN RECENT YEARS -- YOU CAN SEE THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE THE CHANCELLR'S OFFICE PROPERTY TAXES HAVE BEEN. UNDER REPORTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE P. ONE POINT IN TIME AND THAT'S LARGELY RELATED TO WHEN PROPERTY TAXES ARE COLLECTED -- FOR P. ONE AND THE LAST THREE YEARS -- PROPERTY TAXES HAVE BEEN. UNDER REPORTED BY YOU KNOW CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME. OTHER EXPLANATION SUCH AS THE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CALCULATION OF EXPENDITURES FOR THEIR CURRENT YEAR SHORTFALL WE THINK THERE'S SOME OVERSTATING OF EXPENDITURES INCLUDING -- A MISCALCULATION OF THAT THREE YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE BASE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA -- AND THE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO. IT USES A DEFINITION OF TRANSFERS THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO ACCOUNT FOR AND DUPLICATED TRANSFERS AND SO FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WE THINK -- THAT THE REPORTED SHORTFALL IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS IS NOT AS GREAT AS IS. CURRENTLY BEING STATED SO WOULD WE FIX THIS WHERE WOULD WE ADDRESS THAT IN THE BUDGET. YEAH RIGHT NOW WE ARE -- ME THE ART OF DANCE IS A LOT OF SWAY HER SOMEONE EARNED. RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO A SOLUTION SO THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT AGAIN IF IN FACT THEY ARE DOING AND MISSING YOUR DOING THAT BUT IF THAT'S HAPPENING. THERE'S ACCOUNTING. YEAH WE WERE UPDATING EXPENDITURES AS WE ARE A LEADING UP TO THE MAY REVISION WHICH IS THIS COMING UP VERY SOON WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING. UPDATED REVENUES SO WE ARE MONITORING YOU KNOW THIS THE SITUATION VERY CLOSELY -- OKAY. THE DIED IN DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING. I'M RICHARD HE THOUGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DATA WE HAVE UPDATED DATE AT THAT WE RECEIVE AT THE MERE VISION. AND TYPICALLY WHEN THERE ARE SHIPS AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUES AT THE ME REVISION -- A FINANCE PROPOSES THAT MAKES A FINE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT THE MAY REVISED MAY ADDRESS THE SITUATION BECAUSE I YEAH I HAVE A CHALLENGE OF THE YOU KNOW. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COME EVER SAY LOOK WE HAVE THIS BIG SHORTFALL AND THEN YOU GUYS A WAY MAYBE THEY DON'T I JUST HOPE THIS WILL BE WORKED OUT PRIOR TO THIS HEARING GOING FORWARD THAT'S JUST MY TAKE. BUT EITHER WAY -- THANK YOU AND I JUST COUPLE OTHER -- OF THOUGHTS QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT FUNDING FORMULA IS IT IS UNPREDICTABLE. IT BOUNCES TOO MUCH I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT IT'S COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT -- IT EVEN THE LA -- SAYS IT COULD FLUCTUATE GREATLY FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AS YOU AS YOU CONTEMPLATE SOME CHANGES. TO THE FUNDING FORMULA AND THE STUDENT SUCCESS MEASURES CONCERN ME GREATLY BECAUSE THE USE IT STUDENT WHO TRANSFERS TO UC GENERATES LESS FUNDING THAN A TRANSFER TO A CSU BECAUSE THAT ASSOCIATES. DEGREE REQUIREMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BOTHERING FOR SOMETIME THE CHANCES ARE CAME DOWN AND TALK TO MY OFFICE. MANAGER WELL -- IN -- YOU KNOW. I THOUGHT ALLAY MY CONCERNS BUT THEY'RE BACK AS TO WHY WE'RE EVEN REQUIRING AN A AD TRANSFERRING THAT SEEMS ODD TO ME THAT WE WORK WE REQUIRE THAT. BECAUSE LOOKS LIKE THERE. IS FOR ONE AGAIN WHEN A STUDENT TRANSFERS TO THE TO SEE ISSUE. IT SCORE HIGHER. ON THE INDICATORS AND OF A STUDENT TRANSFERS TO THE UC AND WONDERING WHY THAT IS. AND AGAIN I'M STILL WONDERING GO BACK TO WHY WE HAVE THE A AND AND YOU CAN EVEN DANCES AT SIXTY UNITS IS FIFTY SIX WAS A FIFTY SIX IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED AS A TO TRANSFER AS A AS I I I RECALL -- BUT IF THE OTHER QUESTION I WITH GUARDED THIS FORMULA AND THE AND AND AND THAT AND THE MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE. WOULD IT PROMOTE AND CREATE. THE A A WHAT IT -- WITH THE COLLEGE. GAME THE SYSTEM BY CREATING SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES THAT DON'T REALLY DO MUCH FOR STUDENTS. TO INSURE REVENUE GROWTH. AND YOU WANT TO SPEAK. TO BUILDING OUR HEART OF THAT -- SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT -- YOU KNOW THE THE EXPECTATION AROUND A TRANSFER WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE -- BUT WE WOULD SAY WITHOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA DOES NOT REQUIRE IT IT CERTAINLY CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES. TO BUT STUDENTS ON A PATH TOWARDS IN AT T.. THE RATIONALE BEING THAT STUDENTS. ON A PATH TOWARDS IN AT T. OUR STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DECIDE UP FRONT WHEN THEY HAVE A GOAL TO TRANSFER WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY WANT TO TRANSFER. THAT IN AT T. PROVIDES GREATER OPTIONS THE SYSTEMS WORKING WITH YOU SEE AN WITH INDEPENDENT COLLEGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AT T. AS A RECOGNIZE TRANSFER PATHWAY FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS -- IT MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS LEAVE THE COLLEGES WITH A DEGREE IN CASE THEY TRANSFER NOT DON'T ULTIMATELY EARNED A DEGREE IT GIVES THEM SOME GUARANTEES A PAY ATTENDED THE CSU. RECOGNIZING YOUR CONCERNS I THINK THERE ARE -- THERE ARE POLICY WERE -- REASONS PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS THAT WE THINK. LEAVING WITH AT T. PROVIDE REAL QUICK IMAGE OVER THERE SO THAT IF I'M A COLLEGE I'M I'M I'M A COMMITTEE BECAUSE I'M GOING INCENTIVIZE OF STUDENTS FROM THE ASSOCIATE. THE A A PATH I MIGHT EVEN GIVE THEM CLASSES BEFORE I GIVE STUDENTS WHO AREN'T ON THE A PATH RIGHT. THAT'S A PROBLEM ISN'T IT. AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE THE THE RESPONSE MIGHT BE FOR STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE COLLEGE WITH AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL OF TRANSFER THERE SHOULD BE ONE PATH THERE SHOULD NOT BE A MULTIPLE PATHS THAT. A TRANSFER STUDENT WHO WANTS TO EARN AN A A TRANSFER STUDENT WHO WANTS TO SIMPLY TRANSFER WITHOUT A DEGREE SO I THINK THE GOAL IS HOW DO YOU MAKE THE AT T. -- YEAH THE LEGISLATION -- LIMITS THE NUMBER OF UNITS IN AT T. AND THE GOAL IS TO SAY -- STUDENT SHOULD WHO SEEK TO TRANSFER SHOULD HAVE A A CLEAR PATHWAY TO TRANSFER BASED ON THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM THERE AND NOT BASED ON THE INSTITUTION OF THEIR THAT THEY ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFER -- TO COULD YOU RECALL COULD THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE A EIGHT FORCE THE JAKE UNITS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN NEED. I WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S A CASE THAT THAT -- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE IN SOME INSTANCES BUT I THINK IT'S TYPICAL WHAT'S THAT IT'S NOT A TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT TYPICAL BUT I THINK THERE ARE FACULTY AND OTHERS HERE WHO PROBABLY -- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORLD DAY TODAY. IT COULD PROBABLY ANSWER THAT. WE KEEP ON I'M SO I CUT YOU OFF OF NATO AND AND AND I AM -- LOOKING -- FOR FOR MY NOTES ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION -- COULD YOU REMIND ME OF THE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION -- IT HAD TO DO WITH INCENTIVIZE SOME COLLEGES BEING INCENTIVIZE THE TABLE BELOW VALUE CREATE -- SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES TO PROMOTE STUDENT YOU KNOW YEAH RAPID STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TESTS. MORE DOLLARS I THINK IT'S WHAT I'M PART YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING AS WE NEED TO REVIEW THE FORMALIN SO MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT'S A CLEAR -- QUESTION THAT WE HAVE -- BEEN PARTNERING WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND IS WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS FORMULA HAVE. ON THE OUTCOMES THAT OUR STUDENTS ATTAIN -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- IT I THINK. THIS FUNDING FORMULA LIVES -- NEXT TO WITHIN -- A VARIETY OF OTHER PROCESS SEES INCLUDING -- PROCESSES RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE PROGRAM INTEGRITY -- AND SO -- WE THINK THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IN THE SYSTEM BUT AGAIN -- SO THERE PROTECTIONS -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AROUND THE APPROVAL OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHETHER IT CHANGES -- HOW COLLEGES? PUT STUDENTS ON A PATHWAY AND WHETHER COLLEGES PUT MORE STUDENTS ON A PATHWAY TO A SHORT TERM CERTIFICATE. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS AND CERTAINLY INCENTIVES -- AND THE FUNDING FORMULA. THAT ASSIGN DIFFERENT VALUE TO DIFFERENT CREDENTIALS BASED ON BASED ON THE LENGTH OF DEGREE AND AND CERTAINLY THE LABOR MARKET VALUE OF THE DEGREE. AND SO -- WE THINK THAT THERE ARE WE THINK THE INCENTIVES A LOT OUR LINE WE THINK THERE PROTECTIONS BUT CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW. THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING UP A LEGITIMATE BUT SOMETHING'S. I MAYBE THE WORDS WRONG HERE IF WE END UP WITH A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT GIVE OR TAKE. RIGHT I MEAN THERE THE MATH SOMEWHERE IS WRONG. FORMULA SOMEWHERE IS WRONG I THINK WE'D ALL CONCEDE THAT. I THINK THE YOU KNOW I THINK. BUT I THINK WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT IN DESIGNING THE FORMULA -- THE PER -- WORKLOAD MEASURE RATE -- MAY HAVE NEEDED TO BE REFINED PLASTER. JUST. ON THE ON THIS ISSUE OF SORT OF CERTIFICATE THAT THE THINK. UPON I THINK I THINK THERE IS THERE IS GOOD REASON TO WANT TO HONOR THE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE A BIG I I AGREE SOME LIBERAL DON'T AT THIS THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT OF AS A BIGGER CONCERN WITH THE FORMULATE TERMS OF WHERE. THERE COULD BE GAMING IS THE ISSUE OF THE SORT OF THE LOWER UNIT CERTIFICATES THAT COULD BE A PLACE WHERE COLLEGES THAT'S BEEN THE RESOURCES WE THINK THAT THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SUGGEST -- AND I THINK OTHER GROUPS OF THE JUST AS WELL OF CAPPING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT YOU COULD RECEIVE FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AT WHATEVER THE HIGHEST JUST THE THE HIGHEST OUTCOME EARNED. IS ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE SAY IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT IS GETTING AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. YOU KNOW TAKING ON ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT THE CAM BECAUSE DISTRICT THAT'S I THINK WE THINK THAT COULD BE ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THAT. I WOULD SAY ALSO ONE OF THE PROPOSALS I KNOW WE FOR WE HEARD ABOUT SOME CONCERNS WITH COMPLEXITY OF THE FORMULA AND WHY DON'T WE SIMPLIFY IT SO THAT AFTER THE EVERY OUTCOME GETS THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF WE DID THAT I WOULD HAVE MORE CONCERNS WITH THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE AN EIGHTEEN UNITS CERTIFICATE THAT HAS THE SAME VALUE ESTATE SOMEONE WHO TRANSFERRED OR SOMEONE WHO GETS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. IF THAT'S THE WAY WE WOULD CREATE FOR NOT THAT I THINK THAT WE WOULD START TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE NOW. AS THEY CAN BECAUSE DISTRICT YOU GET THE SAME OUTCOMES FOR GETTING SOMEBODY TO AN EIGHTEEN UNIT PROGRAM. AS SOMEONE WHO GOES TO A SIXTY UNIT PROGRAM SO THAT'S I THINK WHY THERE IS. IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL THESE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THE RIGHT VALUES FOR EACH OF THEM IS VERY DIFFICULT. BUT IF WE DO -- ARE WE IF WE HAVE A SIMPLE MORE SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM THAT IS A BOARDING EVERYBODY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHEN. THE AMOUNT OF WORK REQUIRED TO GET THESE DIFFERENT DEGREES IS VERY DIFFERENT THAT COULD BE MORE PROBLEMATIC AND THE TERMS OF JUST. HOW HOW COLLEGES MIGHT RESPOND? YEAH LET ME JUST WE INTEND TO MAKE A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOU ALL BY THE END OF THE MONTH ABOUT CHANGES TO THE FORMULA -- WE HAVE VETTED OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PROPOSAL ON COUNTING ONLY THE HIGHEST AWARD WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INCLUDING OUR CONSULTATION COUNCIL I THINK IT IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO US WITH. THIS THE THE THE THE FORMULAS AN ANIMAL OF THE CHANCE OR SALAS CRACKED IT IS SPECIFIED IN STATUTE IT IS IT IS OKAY YEAR IT DID THAT THEY THE EXISTING STRUCTURES SPECIFIED STATURE YES OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND BRING UP -- ISSUE TO THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND AND I APOLOGIZE OF A I DIDN'T SEE ON MYON MY AGENDA THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TWO PANELS ON THE ON THE PANEL PROGRAM -- THE FIRST ONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. EXCUSE ME CHANCELLOR. MY BAD AS THEY SAY. I'LL CALL YOU BACK [inaudible] MAY BEGIN. MORNING AGAIN MICHELLE NEW IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A SECOND YEAR FREE TUITION. BY EXTENDING THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISED TO FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS IN THEIR SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. THE PROPOSAL BUILT ON CURRENT LAW AS ESTABLISHED BY AB NINETEEN WHICH ITSELF ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. AND ALLOWS COLLEGES TO WAIVE FEES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT LAW EXCEPT FOR EXTENDING THE PROGRAM TO A SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO EXPAND OUT REACH AROUND THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. BY ESTABLISHING THE STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS INITIATIVE. AS MORE COLLEGES IMPLEMENT PROMISE PROGRAMS THERE IS A NEED TO ENSURE THAT COLLEGES CAN EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PROMISE PROGRAMS. THE COST OF COLLEGE IN THEIR FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES. AND THERE PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS. THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT NEED. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER FURTHER QUESTIONS. AND IF WE COULD GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU LISA CAN LET LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM YOUR DENTIST STARTING ON PAGE. THIRTEEN THE STATE HAS A LONG STANDING PROGRAM CALLED THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER THAT COVERS ENROLLMENT FEES FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE FINANCIAL NEED THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVED AT THE RIVER TRADITIONAL BASED PROGRAM. AS YOU RECALL THE STATE RECENTLY EXPANDED FEE WAIVERS TO CERTAIN STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE FINANCIAL NEED SPECIFICALLY FIRST TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED FULL TIME. AND IN THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE. AND NOT PROGRAM IS CALLED THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. THE STATE FIRST FUNDED THIS PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR FUNDS UNDER THIS PROGRAM COLLEGES MUST MEET SIX REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO SKIN SUPPORT. BUT YOU'RE LISTED IN THE MIDDLE OF PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. IN THIS SENSE THE PROGRAM IS ALSO INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN INCENTIVE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THE SPACE [inaudible] COLLEGES CLOSER. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A SHARED THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AN AUGMENTATION OF FORTY MILLION AND BETWEEN NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THAT WOULD ALLOW COLLEGES TO PROVIDE FEE WAIVERS FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WITHOUT FINANCIAL NEED IN THEIR SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE. OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF CONSENSUS THIS PROPOSAL WHICH ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS PRIMARILY A MATTER OF TIMING. BECAUSE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH THE STATE IS FUNDED THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM WE DO NOT YET HAVE SUFFICIENT OUTCOMES TEST TEST IMPACT ON ENROLLMENT FINANCIAL AID PARTICIPATION AND OTHER STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND ABOUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING WE THINK IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND FUNDING FOR IT. I SECOND CONCERN IS MORE DISTRIBUTIONAL IN NATURE. THERE IS CURRENTLY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ON MATT FINANCIAL NEED AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO NON TUITION COSTS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVERS FOR NEEDY STUDENTS. IF THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY THAN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PRIORITIZE ADDRESSING THE EXISTING ON MIGHT NEED. BEFORE EXPANDING IT FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT DEMONSTRATE NEED. FINALLY OUR THIRD POINT JUST RETURNS TO THE IDEA THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUPPORT. HERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT SINCE CREATING THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALSO ENACTED SEVERAL OTHER REFORMS INCLUDING THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. THAT PROVIDE EVEN LARGER FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGES TO ENHANCE STUDENT SUPPORT. FOR THESE REASONS OUR OFFICE DOES RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND REDIRECTING THE FORTY MILLION PROPOSED FUNDING TOWARD OTHER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PRIORITIES. AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES EXPLAINS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES ALSO INCLUDE F. RELATED POSTS ALL OF FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR OUTREACH RELATED TO THE COLLEGE PROMISE AND OTHER STUDENTS SUPPORT INITIATIVES. OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THIS PROPOSAL AND WILL BE SURE TO KEEP FACTORED DATED AS WE COMPLETE OUR RIGHT AT THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY. THANK YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU CHRISTMAS WHENEVER THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I WILL START ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT -- AND WE'VE TAKEN A SLIGHTLY BROADER IF YOU JUST PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE THAT THE COLLEGE PROMISES INTENDED TO SOLVE. BUT ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVEN I THINK ONE WAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DESCRIBE WHO ENROLLS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO OUR STUDENTS ARE. OUT TO WAYS OF DESCRIBING THEM THAT I THINK ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT -- FOR THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE PROMISE OF OUR THEIR AGE THAT NEARLY MORE THAN 40% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WE TEND TO SERVE. A POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT SKEWS OLDER SKEWS -- CERTAINLY A POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT -- IS SIGNIFICANT IS NOT COMING TO US DIRECTLY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. A SECOND WE SERVE A A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS THE REVERSE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS ACROSS SEGMENTS -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH NEARLY HALF OF OUR STUDENTS IDENTIFYING AS LATIN ACTS. IF YOU MOVE ON TO PAGE -- EIGHT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- THE HISTORY OF ENROLLMENT FEES AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND DAD ENROLLMENT FEES TODAY OR FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER UNIT SPECIFIED IN STATUTE THE LOWEST IN THE US -- BUT MOST STILL -- NEARLY HALF OF STUDENTS TO MOST OF UNITS ARE WAIVED UNDER THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE EIGHT WE SHOW THAT -- THE ROMAN FEES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. BUT THEY ARE A SMALL PART OF FOR BOTH STUDENTS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS LIVING AT HOME AND THOSE WHO ARE LIVING AWAY FROM HOME WE SHOW -- FOR ONE COLLEGE TOTAL COSTS THERE -- THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS LIVING AT HOME TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS -- AWAY FROM HOME FOR STUDENT ATTENDING FULL TIME THAT THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS -- TUITION IN -- FOR THE YEAR IS LESS THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THAT THEY FACE AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP OF PAGE -- NINE WE INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS THAT SHOWS THAT -- FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE REGIONS WHERE THERE IS A UC CAMPUS. IN NONE OF THE REGIONS IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE LOWEST THAT PRICE FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. AND IN SEVEN OF THE REGION'S IT IT IS THE HIGHEST COST COMPARED TO THE UC IN THE CSU. AND SO WITH THAT WE BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE NINE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CAL COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT INCLUDED WITH THE PROGRAM THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT INCLUDED IN OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS TO INCLUDE -- TO INCREASE COLLEGE PREPARATION IMPROVE PREPARATION FOR JOBS INCREASE TRANSFER FROM THE UC OUT TO THE YOU SEE IN THE CSU. AND TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS BOTH ACROSS GROUPS OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND SO AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE DESCRIBED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS IN AB NINETEEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. AND THE STATUTE AUTHORIZES BUT NOT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT COLLEGES -- WAIVE FEES FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO DO NOT ALREADY RECEIVE FEE WAIVERS. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TEN WE SHOW HOW WE ALLOCATED THE FUNDS SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OUT WE USED -- FIRST AS THE PRIMARY CRITERIA -- THE NUMBER OF UNITS AT A COLLEGE THAT WERE NOT WAIVED UNDER THE EXISTING FEE WAIVER POLICIES -- THAT WAS ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ALLOCATION WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS WE ALLOCATED THAT TO COLLEGES BASED ON THEIR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND THEIR COUNTS OF POWDERED RECIPIENTS. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD ALL THE ALLOCATE THE FUNDING BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING FEE WAIVERS. I'M AND THEN TO CLOSE ON THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A HUNDRED FIVE COLLEGES CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM MOST USED AT LEAST PART OF THEIR MONEY FOR FEE WAIVERS FOR THOSE FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. SOME COLLEGES DID USE MONEY -- FOR GRANTS FOR NOT TUITION COSTS INCLUDING FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND BOOKS -- AND SOME COLLEGES USED -- FOR FUNDING FOR SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE COUNSELORS AND ADVISERS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A NINE COLLEGES THAT CHOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO WORK WITH THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN. NINETEEN TWENTY WE BELIEVE THAT AT LEAST FOR WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM -- IN THE COMING YEAR. AND THEN WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AROUND THE STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS AND IF ADDITION OF WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL -- WE BELIEVE THAT IF MESSAGING IMPROVE MESSAGING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAMS WORK -- THEN WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE RECEIVE A COHERENT MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT COLLEGE PROMISE MEANS. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR SECOND PANEL HERE HEARING FROM SOME. I'LL JUST ACROSS CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE GET TO THE Q.

THE CALIFORNIA WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF YOUR INVESTMENT GENERATIONS. LOS ANGELES THE LA THIS PROGRAM IS MUCH MORE. THAN THREE TUITION. THE ONLY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR ORGANIZATIONS ACCESS PROGRAM WELL. BASED ON A NATIONWIDE BEST PRACTICES. TODAY THE PROGRAM SERVES NEARLY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND REQUIRES FULL TIME ROLE IN A STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL PLAN IS NOT AN ENGLISH. APPLYING FOR ALL STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIALLY IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN STUDENT SUPPORT INTERVENTION. FOR THE PROGRAM PROVIDES THE PAST HIGH SCHOOL I REACH. TUITION FREE EDUCATION FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND SECOND. PARDEE REGISTRATION ACCESS IS IT'S NOT RENTS AND SERVE AS AMBASSADORS AND INTERNATIONAL IN RICHMOND PROGRAM FUNDED AGAIN WITH SUPPORT FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND GENEROUS DONORS. THIS PROGRAM OF THE LAST YEAR HAS TAKEN COLLEGE PROMISE STUDENTS TO EGYPT. MAKO JAPAN AND THIS SUMMER WILL BE SENDING PROMISE STUDENTS TO FRANCE AND VIETNAM AS IN A RICHMOND EXPERIENCE. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS SO THIS PROVIDES A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM INDEED. AS IS YOUR WHERE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HOUSING FOOD AND SECURE. EFFORTS TO ASSISTANCE WITH INCREASED FINANCIAL AID THAT COVERS THEIR BASIC NEEDS WILL GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING STUDENTS TO FILL THEIR EDUCATIONAL. POTENTIAL. FOUR STATES COMMITTEE COLLEGES THE ABILITY TO TELL ALL STUDENTS. IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT THE FIRST YEAR. OF TUITION IS FREE HAS ENABLED US TO BREAK DOWN AXIS BEARS ARE PREVENTED STUDENTS FROM ATTEMPTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR FOR A LIFETIME TO CAREER. OR PROFESSION. AS A RESULT THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN POWERFUL. POWERFUL AN IMPROVING COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES CONSIDER THE RESULTS OF LA IN ONLY TWO YEARS. OVERLY ROMAN FOR RECENT LAUSD GRADUATES HAS INCREASED BY 24%. FULL TIME ENROLLMENT FOR FIRST TIME COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM LAUSD HAS INCREASED 54%. DISTRICT WIDE IN FROM OUR FIRST COURT OF LA COLLEGE PROMISE STUDENTS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED ARE READY TO TRANSFER INELIGIBLE TO GRADUATE THIS SPRING.

THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT OUR PROGRAM IS 72% BLACK NEXT. 82% LOW INCOME BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANT CRITERIA OUR INITIAL COURT HAS SHOWN THESE DRAMATIC POSITIVE OUTCOMES. OVER 90% OF OUR STUDENTS ATTEMPTED ENGLISH AND MATH WITH MORE STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM COMPLETING TRANSFER LEVEL OF BOTH THEN WE HAD SEEN PREVIOUSLY ACROSS THE AND TRY DISTRICT. 89% OF FALL SEMESTER STUDENTS PERSISTED THROUGH THE SPRING SEMESTER. 76% FROM NOT SPRING PERSISTED TO FALL MORE THAN THREE OUT OF FOUR WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS CONTINUED ON AS FULL TIME STUDENTS WHICH WE KNOW IS THE KEY TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS. BROWN TRUCK THAT HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS COMPLETE IN ONLY TWO YEARS THIS SPRING I LOOK FORWARD TO REPORTING THAT DATA IN THE FALL. THE BENEFITS OF AB NINETEEN AND NOW AB TWO FUELS OUR ABILITY. TO SUSTAIN OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO OUR STUDENTS AND TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE INVESTMENTS HAVE HAD A MAJOR IMPACT WILL BE ON THE TUITION THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE. THE PROGRAM BUILDS A STRONG FORWARD LOOKING COLLEGE GOING CULTURE ONE THAT THROUGH INCLUSION OF ALL. IT HAS SERVE THOSE MOST IN NEED AND BUILD THE STUDENT SUCCESS PROGRAM THOSE PRISONERS PRODUCE THESE WONDERFUL AND FOR US IN LA UNPARALLELED OUTCOMES. FINALLY IN CLOSING I WANT TO MENTION THE MOUNTING SUPPORT AT THIS PROGRAM HAS INSTILLED. IN OUR COMMUNITY IT IS INDEED A TALKING AND LEVERAGING POINT. THE LA COLORS PROMISE PROGRAM IS BROUGHT TOGETHER BUSINESS CIVIC AND PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS IS BUILT A MUTUAL SENSE OF COMMITMENT FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. A MAY TWENTY NINE OVER PARTNERS WILL JOIN US IN THE CELEBRATION OF OUR FIRST ELLIE COLLEGE PROMS GRADUATION POSTED BY MAYOR CARCETTI. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE THAT I CAN STATE LEC CITY STRONGLY SUPPORTS EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM FOR TWO YEARS OF TUITION FREE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IT'S SIMPLY THE BEST INVESTMENT WE HAVE WITNESSED FIRST HAND IN LOS ANGELES THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN EXTENDING THE PROGRAM FOR SECOND YEAR. OUR STUDENTS HAVE TOLD US THAT A SECOND YEAR FINANCIALLY SUPPORT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR FULL TIME STATUS. AND INDEED THERE ALTERNATE SUCCESS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN AB TWO WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE. THIS COMMITMENT FOR ALL STUDENTS SO THAT THEY TOO CAN COMPLETE THE PROMISE AND ACHIEVE. THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE IT ANSWERED QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CANCER WILL COME BACK% TO YOU -- IN A IN A MOMENT -- PRESIDENT THE FRANCO. GREAT CHERRY MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY MY NAME IS JEFF TO FRANCO I'M SUPERINTENDENT PRESIDENT FOR LIKE TALK ME COLLEGE DISTRICT. IT'S GOOD THAT WERE UP HERE WITHOUT LIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE THE OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM WE ARE CONSIDERED A SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY AGE WE SERVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FTS. IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE COMMUNITY -- BUT GIVE ME A SENSE OF MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HIGH NEED ABOUT AT THIS TIME. IN COLLEGE PROMISES BEEN VERY TRANSFORMATIVE FROCK CAMPUS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PAST SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES AND SPECIFICALLY THIS PROGRAM IT'S BEEN A CATALYST THAT OUR CAMPUS LA IN MANY OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I HAVE THREE MAJOR POINTS IT ONTO MY PRESENTATION I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOUR CURRENT PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S MADE POSSIBLE FREE BE. NINETEEN OUR FUTURE EXPANSION AND WHAT THE STATE COULD DO TO SUPPORT IT AND FINALLY SOME OF THE RESEARCH ON COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAMS NATIONALLY AND HOW WE COMPARED ORGAN TENNESSEE AND OTHER STATES. THAT ARE LEADING THE WAY ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA. SO THE LATE TALK BECAUSE PROMISE WAS ACTUALLY LAUNCHED IN FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO OUR FOUNDATION ABOUT GETTING BEHIND THIS INITIATIVE IT WAS ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THAT ALLOWED US TO YOU. TO MOVE IT CREATED THAT CALLOUS MOMENT TO MOVE TO GO FORWARD. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING TUITION WAIVERS FOR OUR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WE A BRAIDED OUR STATE FUNDS WITH LOCAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS TO FREE BUS PASSES. SO YOU GET TO AND FROM WORK AND SCHOOL IN ADDITIONALLY INFUSE OUR LENDING LIBRARY SO STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS THE CHECKOUT TEXTBOOKS FOR THEIR ACADEMIC TERM TO NOT HAVE TO BUY THOSE AND OF COURSE WE COUPLE THAT WITH OUR OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE -- EFFORTS IN OUR FOUNDATIONS TAKEN MORE OF ITS LOCAL FUNDS IN TRIPLED ITS EMERGENCY BOOK FUND FOR STUDENTS THAT CAN'T MEET THEIR BOOK NEEDS TO THOSE OTHER. THIS OTHER MECHANISMS. SO OUR PROGRAM NOT ONLY HAS EXPANDED THAT TUITION WAIVERS WERE PROVIDED EVERY OTHER SUPPORT CENTER CRITICAL FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SPECIFIC. BUT SPECIFICALLY MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT ONLY TRADITIONALLY BENEFITTED FOR THE WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER. WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS TO SHARE THIS FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR FIRST TIME FULL TIME ENROLLMENT IS UP 10% YEAR OVER YEAR AND SELL COLLEGE PROMISES CLEARLY MEETING ITS GOAL AS BEING AN ACCESS INITIATIVE. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE VAST MAJORITY THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY WITH A QUALIFIED UNDER WHAT WAS FORMALLY KNOWN AS A BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEW EVER. BUT IT'S THE SIMPLIFIED MESSAGE OF FIRST TIME FULL TIME TUITION FREE THAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES SPECIFICALLY MANY OF OUR FIRST GENERATIONS FAMILIES. I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE HAS MANY TIMES FOLKS SAY THIS. ASSEMBLY BILL TO YOU ARE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET JUST GONNA BENEFIT -- SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE NEEDS BUT OUR ABILITY TO SAY FIRST TIME FULL TIME TUITION FREE REALLY CLARIFIES THAT THE DOORS ARE OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE IT'S EASILY UNDER SAID. SO WHERE WE GOING FROM HERE. WE ARE WITH THE SUPPORT OF AARCS FOUNDATION DOING A THREE YEAR ON RAMP TO EXPAND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES BEYOND TUITION WAIVERS BUT DURING THOSE THREE YEARS. IN ADDITION THE LANDING IRAN BUS PASSES THAT THEY WILL GET BOOKS STATEMENTS EACH TERM AS A PERSISTS SO IT'S BASICALLY A CARROT HELP SINCE THE MOVEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AXIS ISN'T SIMPLY ENOUGH. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THIS FROM AN ACCESS PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY COMPLETION PROGRAM WHICH IS VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S -- PROGRAMS AND PRIORITIES. I COULD SHARE WITH YOU. THAT IT IS THE STATE WHO IS HELP MAKE THIS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE STATE HAS FUND IN ONE YEAR AND HOPEFULLY WILL EXPAND TO TWO YEARS HERE. IT ALLOWS ME TO GO TO MY LOCAL FOUNDATION AND ASK THEM TO RE DIRECTOR FUNDS FOR ALL THESE RAPPER AND SUPPORT STUDENT SERVICES. SUCH AS BOOKS AND TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS MONIES LOCAL MONIES FOR PEER MENTORING AND DEDICATED CANCER FOR PROMISE STUDENTS THAT WE KNOW THESE THINGS IS REFERENCE SERVICES MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR COMPLETION. TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THE CURRENT NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR THREE YOUR COMPLETION IS 22% FOR THE SECOND COHORT. AT CITY UNIVERSITY NEW YORK ME COLLEGES THEY'RE SEEN CRATER THAN 50% COMPLETION FOR THREE YEAR -- STUDENTS THROUGH PROVIDING THESE WRAPAROUND SERVICES WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT IN BY THE STATE SUPPORT FOR TUITION WAIVERS. COUPLE THAT WITH LOCAL MONIES TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL REFERENCE SERVICES. SO FINALLY I SHOULD WITH YOU TO HEAR TODAY OF POLICY BRIEF THAT I PUT TOGETHER THAT REALLY IT TAKES A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE NATIONWIDE AND WE ALL KNOW SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH WORKFORCE RAID READINESS. STUDENT DAT -- ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND THOSE ARE WELL DOCUMENTED BUT LOOKING AT TENNESSEE FOR AGAIN NEW YORK THESE OTHER THESE OTHER STATES ARE TAKING ONLY ON STATE WHERE PROGRAMS -- WE ARE THERE ALONG A LONGER SIDE BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS A CHANCE HERE TO BE A LEADER AGAIN AS WE OFTEN HAD. AND NOT JUST MAKE THIS ABOUT A ONE YEAR ACCESS INITIATIVE BUT MOVE FROM ACCESS TO COMPLETION BY PROVIDING MULTIPLE YEARS. OF TUITION WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS SO NOT ONLY CAN THEY GET IN THE DOOR BUT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET GET ACROSS THE STAGE IN MOVE ON TO BE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK MORE THAN TWO YEARS. I WOULD SAY I THINK TWO YEARS IS THE NEXT STEP I THINK HERE'S THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS A GOOD ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR GUIDED PATHWAYS INITIATIVE IN YOUR FOCUS ON COMPLETION. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT SUPPORTING -- ASSEMBLY BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. METHODS TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD THAT SECOND YEAR I COULD TELL YOU LOCALLY WE'RE GONNA PROVIDING THREE YEARS OF FOUNDATION SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS FOR THE BOOK VOUCHERS IN THOSE OTHER MECHANISMS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES IT TAKES SINCE MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO GET TO GET THROUGH THE PAST SO -- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND STAND READY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. MR GREEN. HI THANK YOU ARE LOW YES ARE YOU. VERY WELL THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION JIM MCCARTHY AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'VE GOT SOMETHING I THINK IS BEING PASSED AROUND RIGHT NOW -- SO MY NAME'S JEFF GREEN ON THE CEO OF THE SANTA BARBARA CITY COLLEGE FOUNDATION. AND WE'RE COMING AT THIS AS A AS A COLLEGE THAT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED A PROMISE -- JUST PRIOR TO THE IS REALLY AT THE EARLY PART OF THE WAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THOUGHT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH THE GERMAN MCCARTY -- LAST FALL -- AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MOAN AND AND THIS IS -- REALLY AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO I WILL SKIP THROUGH -- SOME THE OVERVIEW AND AND YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WELL BUT BUT WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE REALLY SET OUT TO SEE WHAT A MODEL PROMISE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE ONLY THREE PROMISE EFFORTS IN. THE STATE -- THOSE WERE OF COURSE VENTURA FIRST -- THEN LONG BEACH AND THEN ON TO QUEST OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH SO WHAT WE DID IS WE'VE SURVEYED ABOUT -- THIRTY PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY THE TIME TO ASK WHAT REALLY WORKED BEST AND IF IF RESOURCES WEREN'T THE BARRIER WHAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE -- THE WAY THEY THEY ALL CAME BACK WITH THEIR RESPONSES WAS WAS -- UNANIMOUS ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT IF THEY WEREN'T THE IF THEY WEREN'T CONSTRAINED BY RESOURCES THEY WOULD DO TO FOR YEARS ALL INCLUSIVE AN OPEN ACCESS TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO THAT'S HOW WE SET OUT TO DO -- AND WE MADE OUR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS VERY BROAD INTENTIONALLY -- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IF THERE'S AN INTEREST -- BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE THE THE SCOPE AND DESIGN WAS BASICALLY BASED ON OUR RESEARCH AND THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY COLORS TO THAT THE FIRST WAS COMPLETELY OPEN ACCESS TO ALL LOCAL STUDENTS -- AND THAT WAS REGARDLESS OF OF PERFORMANCE IN HIGH SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF DEMONSTRATED NEED OR NOT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE THERE'S COURSE NEED IT'S OFTEN NOT. CLEAR -- WHEN WHEN PUT TO PAPER SO WHAT WE DID IS WE OFFER THAT WE PRICED IT OUT -- AND WE CAME UP WITH ABOUT A TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL EXPENDITURE TO DO THIS FOR OUR STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT AND AS OF TODAY IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING THIS. TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS COMING FROM WITHIN OUR AT STCC DISTRICTS OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT WHICH ENCOMPASSES TWO LARGE PUBLIC DISTRICTS AND IN EVERY MANNER OF PRIVATE HOME SCHOOL -- EVERY COMPLETION YOU CAN THINK OF THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INCLUDING SO IT'S REALLY BROAD BASED -- WE DID ABOUT A HUNDRED INTERVIEWS IN THE COMMUNITY TO TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED AND AND CAME BACK WITH WITH THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THIS SO? IN THE END WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS IS CHAU -- GATHER THE DATA THAT WILL SHOW THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON STUDENT SUCCESS STUDENT PERSISTENCE TO COMPLETION AND YOU CAN SEE HERE IN WHAT I'VE HANDED YOU. A LITTLE BIT OF THAT DATA -- THE FIRST COUPLE ARE ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOW THE STUDENTS CARRY WE REQUIRED THE THREE THINGS THAT THE RESEARCH ALL AGREED ON FULL TIME STUDENT STATUS -- WE KNOW THERE'S A COURSE THE COMPLICATION OF THAT BECAUSE THERE SOME STUDENTS WERE THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE -- ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR COMMUNITY WELL THE VARIOUS TYPES OF OF COUNSELING ON ON CAMPUS -- CAN BE COHORT STYLE CAN BE WITH OUR GENERAL COUNSEL DEPARTMENT AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE STUDENTS ACTUALLY BUT YOU GET WITHIN A YEAR SO WE HAVE ABOUT A YEAR'S WINDOW FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION. WHEN THAT WAS ALL SAID AND DONE YOU CAN SEE HERE ARE COMPLETION AND PERSISTENCE RATES UP TO DATE NOW ARE ONLY IN OUR THIRTY YEARS SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE COHORT THAT'S MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH? BUT WHAT WE CAN SHOW IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO REALLY BOOST THE PERSISTENCE RATES IN THOSE FIRST FEW SEMESTERS SO THIS IS GOING BACK JUST TO THE FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT 85% ASSISTANCE RATE. FOR THAT FIRST TO SECOND SEMESTER -- WHICH IS THE BENCHMARK THAT WE'RE NOW WORKING WITH EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE SECOND THIRD -- COHORTS OR SOME MORE DATA HERE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE STUDYING BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPRESSIVE -- GO ARE THESE LAST TWO GRAPHS IF YOU YOU LOOK AT FULL TIME STATUS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE THE BAR GRAPH -- GIVE THE DETAILS BUT THAT THAT FULL TIME STATUS LINE GRAPH -- IT BASICALLY INVERTS SO BY REQUIRING IN SUPPORTING FULL TIME STUDENT STATUS WHAT WE HAVE IS GOING FROM A TWO TO ONE TO A ONE TO TWO RATIO AS FAR AS WHAT OUR LOCAL STUDENTS DOING SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE THE PROBABLY MOST POWERFUL DATA POINT WE HAVE TODAY. WHICH IS THAT BY INCENTIVIZING AND REMOVING SOME OF THESE BARRIERS THAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING -- IN IT NOW WE'RE JUST IN OUR THIRTY YEARS SO WE KNOW THAT WE'LL SEE SOME VARIATION THERE BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST. AND THEN TO MOVE ON TO THE DOLLAR SIDE OF IT WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LAST BLOCK GRAPH YOU I WOULD TRY TO SHOW YOU BY STACKING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. IN OUR CASE WE STARTED THIS EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRIVATE FUNDRAISING ALSO JUST PHILANTHROPY -- AND THEN WITH THE REBRAND OF THE BOG WAIVER AND THEN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE -- THERE'S MORE PIECES TO THE PUZZLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT STACK WHAT IT SHOWS THERE IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANTS. ACTUALLY COVERS ABOUT A LITTLE OVER A THIRD. OF OF THE TOTAL COST OF WHAT WE'RE OFFERING -- AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS OF COURSE THE FOUNDATION THAT'S THE LONGEST STANDING OFFER AND THAT IS THE BASELINE OF SUPPORT -- YOU THEN SEE THERE THAT -- WE WE COVER THE THE ROMAN FEES FOR THE REMAINDER AND THEN THE LARGEST PIECE OF THIS AND AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF THAT I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN. IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE BOOKS SUPPLIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE -- THAT IS THE GREATER BARRIER AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SHOULD WE'RE COVERING EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS. OF COURSE IF WE COULD WE WOULD GO BEYOND THAT AN OFFER OTHER -- FULL COST KIND OF SUPPORT THAT RIGHT AT THIS POINT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE OFFERING. ON AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING. THE BIG THINGS ARE GRAPPLING WITH NOW AND AND I THINK THE THINGS THAT ARE -- THEY'RE GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH OBVIOUSLY IN THE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS ARE HARD TO PRIMARILY ONE IS THE MESSAGING AROUND THAT SO -- FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE RAISING DOLLARS PHILANTHROPIC LEE AND CALLING IT A COLLEGE PROMISE AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE HISTORY GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN KALAMAZOO MICHIGAN -- WHEN ADDITIONAL THINGS BRANDED AS COLLEGE PROMISE ENTER THE PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OUR MESSAGING FOR MESSAGING HAS TO GET CLEAR -- AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WERE HAVING RIGHT NOW WITH OUR PRIVATE BASIS SUPPORT SO WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IT'S IT'S OVER WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS PROMISE ANYMORE. I'M IN FACT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE STATE IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS STEP UP AND AND AND OFFER NEW SOURCES OF SUPPORT AND THIS COR PRIVATELY FUNDED PROMISE IS STILL -- WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR COMMUNITY TO DO SO THAT IS A WITH IN OUR COMMUNITY THE OTHER PIECES OF COURSE THE BRANDING AROUND THE COLLEGE IS IT IS IT FREE COLLEGE IS A FULL SUPPORT IS A TOTAL COSTS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGIES GET VERY CONFUSING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN? THEY'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THIS -- AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FIND WAYS TO INTRODUCE THIS AS THIS IS WHAT OUR COMMUNITY OFFERS THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC MEANS -- THIS IS WHAT THE STATE IS OFFERING -- WE OFTEN LEAD WITH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP HAS DONE THE BEST IN THE ENTIRE NATION ABOUT KEEPING FEES LOW WHEN IT COMES TO TO RUN MOMENT FEES. ON AND STILL FOR MANY STUDENTS THAT IS A BARRIER AND THE BIGGER BARRIERS ACTUALLY EVERYTHING ELSE AND SO IT'S THE EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT COLLEGE PROMISE -- IN OUR REGION -- WE ARE LOOKING AT A FEW OTHER THINGS WHICH I THINK IN THAT IN THE COMING YEARS WHAT WILL GET. A BETTER HANDLE ON WE WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS THE AB NINETEEN FUNDS -- AND YOU SEEN IN YOUR REPORT THAT THE THE THE INCREDIBLE VARIETY OF HOW DISTRICTS ARE USING THOSE -- IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A BIG CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE CAN'T MESSAGE THAT ACROSS THE STATE IN A SINGLE WAY -- AND THERE'S NO THERE IS NO SINGLE EXPLANATION FOR WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING LOCALLY HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT -- AND OF COURSE -- IF WE SEE AB TWO MONEY COMING THROUGH THEN THAT WILL HAVE THAT SAME CONVERSATION AGAIN SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE'RE AT OKAY. THANK YOU. UP I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT LOOKS LIKE OVER HERE FIRST OF WOMEN REALLY MONTHS GREAT THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU PRESENTING PARTICULARLY FROM THOSE THAT FROM THE DISTRICT JEFF THANKS FOR COMING. I'M I'M LOOKING AT YOUR THE BLOCK. THE THE BLOCK AT RAF HERE AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS FOR ALL SCHOOLS IS THIS. SIMILAR BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THIS THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED GRANT IS ABOUT. LITTLE UNDER 40% IF I READ IT RIGHT A LITTLE UNDER 40% OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE WE REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE TOTAL COST OF A TELL ATTENDANCE BUT I WORK WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS WE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE COST OF TUITION. IS THAT SIMILAR FOR ALL DISTRICTS WHERE IT'S SLIGHTLY UNDER 40% THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT CALIFORNIA'S FREE COLLEGE DOES IT PAYS. FOR THAT WERE DOES THAT PERCENT. VERY BASED ON REGION. I DON'T I EIGHT YEAH IF YOU CAN ALL SPEAK TO THAT ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT YEAH I'M IS CERTAINLY VERY IS ON RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSING COSTS IS THE IS THE GREAT VARIABLE THIS BLOCK THEY THIS GRAPH HERE DOES NOT SHOW THAT SERVICE IS. ONLY BE HARD COST OF ATTENDANCE SO THIS IS NOT SHOWING -- FOOD HOUSING ANYTHING ELSE THIS IS JUST THE THE COST OF ATTENDANCE BOOKS SUPPLIES FEES IN OUR CASE THE THE GREATER VARIABLE HERE IS -- CERTAIN CD PROGRAM SAY -- CULINARY OR MARINE DIVING TACTIC AND HAVE MUCH HIGHER SUPPLY ANOTHER REQUIREMENT COSTS AND THEN SAY AND AND ENGLISH ASSOCIATES WHICH IS GOING TO BE A SMALLER CASA THAT'S ACTUALLY GREATER VARIANCE IT'S AVERAGED INTO THIS BLOCK IT DOES NOT COUNT FOR OTHER COSTS. IN THIS LIMóN I WOULD SIMPLY ADD THAT ARE FACTORED THE NUMBER THAT WE USE IS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE. AT A COMMITTEE COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES. SO OF THAT OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IF THAT'S THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHAT DOES THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE ACTUALLY PAY FOR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT DOESN'T PAY FOR ALL EIGHTEEN DOWN -- IT'S 829%. IT PAYS 4829% OF THE CORRECT THEM BECAUSE THIS THIRTEEN UNDER EIGHTY DOLLARS. IS IT TOO IS THE FEE WAIVER OUR THE FLUFFY. EIGHTEEN OUR AND THEN IT WAS JUST. SIMILAR I'M I THINK THOSE PERCENTAGES ARE VERY ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT YOU'D SEE UP IN IN THE STATE AND THAT THE TUITION FEE WAIVER IT'S A HURDLE BUT IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE HURDLES AND I THINK. ASISTIR MEAN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY BILL -- TO THERE'S ALSO SENATE BILL TWO NINETY ONE THAT'S BEING SPENT ON THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT. THE MOON THE EXPANSIVE NEEDS AND SUPPORTS OUR NEEDS INDUSTRY FOR OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND SO IT'S NOT ONE POLICY THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE ALL THIS BUT I THINK PROMISES A VERY IMPORTANT STEP BECAUSE IT REMOVES A BARRIER TUITION AND IT SIMPLIFIES THE THE MESSAGE TO FAMILIES IN INCOMING. STUDENTS IN THIS POINT OUTSOURCING BEAUTIFULLY FROM THE SANTA BARBARA EXAMPLE ABLE TO LEVERAGE. THE COLLEGE PROMISE FOR THE TREMENDOUS CIVIC AND PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. US SO THAT THEY CAN. THE RALLY AROUND THE NOTION THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE SO THAT'S WHAT MANY WORK UNITS HAVE DONE IT'S A LEVERAGE POINT IT CERTAINLY IS. GREAT AND NOW THE SECOND HER IS IT THERE HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW SEND SOME DESCRIPTIONS OF KIND OF HOW WE CAN ENHANCE WHETHER IT'S THE MESSAGING OR THE WORK AND YOU'RE IN FRONT OF ALL OF US NOW COULD YOU PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS I MEAN IT'S JUST BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT. THERE COULD BE WAYS TO LEVERAGE MORE IF WE MESSAGE DAY IN A DIFFERENT WAY IF WE'VE PARTNERED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT WITH THOSE SUGGESTIONS LOOK LIKE. YEAH I I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT THE DEAD PARSING OUT THE TYPES OF BARRIERS THE TYPES OF COSTS IS USEFUL AND I UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLICITY OF A FREE COLLEGE MESSAGING -- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A DISSERVICE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE IT IT GIVES PEOPLE -- THE IT BAKERIES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT COVERED -- AND AND HISTORICALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY COLLEGES TALKED ABOUT WE'RE TALKING TYPICALLY ABOUT THE TUITION AND FEE OR MAYBE ROOM AND BOARD IF YOU'RE TALK ABOUT RESIDENTIAL FOUR YEAR -- AND SO THIS WAY OF TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE ESPECIALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES REALLY RELATIVELY NEW ESPECIALLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS THAT ARE COLLEGES WHO WHO REMEMBER IT DIFFERENTLY TALK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY SO IT'S REALLY A RETRAINING OF TOTAL COSTS. MEANS AND THEN WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE HOUSING. THE FOOD SECURITY AND OF COURSE TUITION BOOKS AND IF YOU ACTUALLY TEAR THAT -- THAT THE MOST USEFUL THING I'VE SEEN ON THAT AND AND I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES OF CFC THIS IS THE IS TEDIOUS RESEARCH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY COMPILED ALL TOOK. ALL IN COSTS OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THEN BACKED OUT OF PRO RATA SHARE OF WHAT FINANCIALLY GRANTED NOT NOT THAT IS AVAILABLE -- AND WHAT THEY DID IS ESSENTIALLY INVERTED THAT THAT HIGHER BECAUSE OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT A FOUR YEAR YOU YOU SEE. IS ACTIVE THE MOST EXPENSIVE IT ACTUALLY INVERTS IN MOST REGIONS WHERE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE BECAUSE SO LITTLE GRANT EIGHT IS AVAILABLE SO IN THAT IN THAT CONTEXT THIS BECOMES A REALLY VALUABLE TOOL AND AND THE LEVERAGING AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO AROUND IT -- SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MESSAGING WE TENDED TO GO. FOR I MISSED THE ONE I WOULD ADD THAT. STILL TO THIS DAY THERE ARE STILL MANY COMMUNITIES FAMILIES WHO STILL BELIEVE. THAT A HIGHER EDUCATION EVEN THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE EDUCATION. IS STILL OUT OF REACH FOR EXAMPLE THIS FALL 57%. OF ALL OF OUR NEW ATTENDEES WERE FIRST GENERATION IN LOS ANGELES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ALMOST SIX OUT OF TEN SO THEY'RE STILL NEW ENTRIES SO WE STILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE. THE BENEFITS OF AND OF OF A HIGHER EDUCATION TO GOAL LOCAL TO GO LOW COST. AND REALLY TO EXTEND THE LARGER MESSAGE WHICH WE ALL KNOW. THAT EDUCATED CITIZENRY IS THE WAY TO GO IT IS FIELD CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC STRAIGHT FOR DECADES. OF STARTING -- IF YOU WILL WITH THAT IN NINETEEN SIXTY WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AND INVESTED IN ITS INFRASTRUCTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THIS HUMAN CAPITAL SO IT'S THE SAME SORT OF MESSAGING NOW THAT WE NEED ALL PERSONS. IN CALIFORNIA TO BE OF RESPONSIVE ELIGIBLE FOR AND AND ACCOMMODATED THAT AND THEN IN HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE COLLEGES. ARE THE PLACE TO DO THAT WE STILL ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO FULFILL THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE GAP THAT IS NEEDED TO KEEP CALIFORNIA. A COMPETITIVE A FEW WELL -- THE INVESTMENT THAT IS MAY HAVE YOUR KITCHEN IS BY FAR. THE BEST INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA COULD MAKE. WITH RESPECT TO INVEST IN AS PEOPLE IT THE ALLEVIATES OTHER KINDS OF IT OF IF WE WILL. SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORTS AND OTHER THINGS IF WE DON'T EDUCATE FOLKS THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH SO THE MESSAGING NEEDS TO BE AROUND THE NEED FOR BENEFITS OF AND WHY IT MATTERS. IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SINCE WE HAVE A MULTI LINGUAL -- STATE BEAUTIFULLY A MULTI LEVEL STATE. AND I WAS BRIEFLY ADD TO TO MESSAGING THE CONSIDERATIONS. I THINK WANT ONE THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GO TO OUR DONORS AT THIS POINT AND SAYING THIS THE STATE HAVE SKIN IN THIS GAME BUT BUT WE NEED MORE. TO FINISH THE PUZZLE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THIS TOTAL COSTS OF ATTENDANCE IN SO I THINK THAT THE MORE THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO DO IT ALLOWS US TO GO BACK TO THE SAME DONORS AND SAVE. THE STATE'S NOW DO YOU KNOW ADDED THE SECOND YEAR FOR TUITION WE NEED YOUR HELP TO ADD A SECOND YOU'RE FOR BOOKS SO I I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT THAT HOPE YOU'RE CONSIDERING -- CERTAINLY IF YOU WANT ONE MESSAGING THING AND I HAVE A SOLUTION ON THIS BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE CONSISTENT REFER TO THE BORDER GOVERNOR SKI WAIVER EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANT FOR NUMBER YEARS. AND THAT'S CREATED A LITTLE CONFUSION THE MARKET PLACE OUT THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA PROMISE WHICH IS FIRST TIME FULL TIME TUITION FREE AND WE KNOW WE WILL THAT SINCE YOU START FULL TIME INCOMPLETE. THOSE UNITS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN COMPLETE ON TIME -- BUT THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER PROMISE GRANT THAT'S OUT THERE -- SO THAT THAT HAS CREATED SOME CONFUSION WITH OUR AS SOON POPULATIONS ARE FAMILIES -- EVEN WITH ARE CANCELING STAFF AND SO THAT SOMETHING AS A STATE AT SOME POINT WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THOSE PROGRAMS -- MORE CLEARLY THANK YOU. YES I CAN APPLES ON APPLE. I WELL WOULD BE I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE NEED THE SAME THING TWICE BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. BUT BUT I I DID WANT TO MENTION ELEMENT MISTER GALLAGHER HAD HAS THAT'S COMMENTS HERE JUST REAL QUICK WE JUST HAD A EVENT OUTSIDE WITH THE CSU STUDENTS AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW. IT'S 18%. FOR THREE EIGHTY FIRST IT'S EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PER YEAR HE SAID IT'S 18% REBEL OR NO THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE YEAH HE INCLUDE THE COST LIVING BOOKS. AND OTHER COSTS OF ATTENDANCE THE TUITION PART IS OVER 90% OF THE COST OF COMMUNICABLE JUST NON PRESCRIPTION YEAH SO IT'S CSU THE STATE'S WERE SAYING IT'S ABOUT 80%. STILL THAT THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S THE POINT HERE -- I'M GONNA COME BACK YOU GUYS IN A BIT BUT MISTER GALLAGHER. YES -- IS GOING TO GET INTO TO HAVE YOU SEEN ANY KIND OF DATA OR BE TRACKED ANY DATA IS IN TOWN OF ONLYHAD THIS FOR ONE YEAR NOW BUT SHOWING THAT WE'VE HAD. YOU KNOW MORE STUDENTS THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE -- AND AND ALSO. ON THAT SAME LINE OF THAT SAME TRACK THAT YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO'VE COME IN RIGHT NOW UNDER THE PROMISE. PROGRAM FIRST YEAR WHO ARE. SAYING THEY WOULD NOT GO FOR A SECOND HERE BECAUSE THE THE FEE THE FEES WOULD. THEN BE REINSTATED YEAH. WE WE HAVE SOME DATA SO WE OURS GOES BACK THREE YEARS NOW SO THE DATA WE DO HAVE SHOWS UR INITIAL PROJECTION BASED ON OUR ENROLLMENT -- SO FOR FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT EIGHT HUNDRED WAS THAT THE MEDIAN ENROLLMENT OVER THE PRIOR FIVE YEARS. EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE SO WE PROJECTED OUR PROMISE PARTICIPATION BASED ON THAT DATA POINT ON WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT WHEN YOU OFFER AN INCENTIVIZE AND BUILD A STRUCTURE LIKE THIS -- YOU OUT WE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS MUCH ROOM TO GO UP BECAUSE OUR OUR CAPTURE EIGHT IN DISTRICT IS ALREADY. BASICALLY 50% -- AS IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS THERE WAS ROOM SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THIRTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE PROMISE AT A TIME WHICH IS WHAT WE PROJECTED WHERE AT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL ENROLLMENT THE SAME THING AND ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPHS AND THE IN. THAT PRESENTATION YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE WE HAD TWO SIMULTANEOUS TRENDS SO WE'VE HAD FALLING ENROLLMENT FOR TEN YEARS IN OUR DISTRICT -- BUT LOCAL ENROLLMENT IS ACTUALLY LEVELED OUT AND NOW BEGUN TO INCREASE OF OUR OVERALL ENROLLMENT IS STILL DROPPING -- AND IS A NUMBER OF FACTORS WE BELIEVE FOR THAT -- INCLUDING OF THE PROLIFERATION OF PROMISE EFFORTS KEEPING FOLKS MORE LOCAL -- BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING AN INCREASE OF A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE CLOSE MISTER GELLER EFFECT ON AT ON THE LOS ANGELES STORY. IS ALSO A GOOD STORY WHILE OVERALL THE ROMANS A LITTLE SOFT IN THE OR STOP THE STATEWIDE WE SOLVED OVERALL INCREASE. OF 24% FROM OUR LA U. S. THE STUDENT GRADUATES OVER TWO YEARS. TO LACC THE AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT TO PUT THAT IN NUMBERS WE HAD FOUR THOUSAND SIXTY THREE STUDENTS PARTICIPATE YEAR. ONE THIS WAS BEFORE AB NINETEEN WAS ENACTED IN WITH AB NINETEEN AT FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED IN THE SECOND YEAR AND WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS. TEN THOUSAND BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS OF THE ANSWER IS YES. WITH THESE STUDENTS HAVE OTHERWISE COME WELL WE'RE IN. THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT COLLEGE GOING RATE IS PUT IT IN DIFFERENT TERMS 40% OF LA U. S. THE STUDENTS TO NOT GO TO COLLEGE. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS US AN INTERVENTION TO INCREASE THE COLLEGE GOING RATE THE STUDENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT BY IT THE THE MOST. WITH THE STUDENTS HAVE NORMALLY COME YEAR ONE YEAR TO WILL THE PERSISTENCE RATES. THAT I SHARED WERE SIGNIFICANT OVER 90% FROM FALL TO SPRING AND THEN 76% FROM SPRING TO FALL DOES MOMENTUM POINTS THAT STUDENTS GAIN. ACADEMIC CONFIDENCE KING COURSES AND TAKE ENGLISH AND MATH IN THEIR FIRST YEAR EMISSIONS MAP HAS PROVEN TO BE EITHER A GATEKEEPER OR A GATEWAY. IT'S A COMPLETION SO THE STUDENTS TAKING THIS COURSE IS THE FIRST YEAR THE HIGHER PERSISTENCE RATES SUGGEST THAT THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING AND IT'S WORKING FOR THE MOST ACADEMICALLY AND LOWER INCOME STUDENTS THAT ARE COMMITTEES OUT. IS THAT 40%. ARE WE INCLUDING AND THAT WHAT ABOUT FOLKS AND I GO TO A TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAM. 60% ANY FORM POST SECONDARY EDUCATION TO ANY TWO YEAR ENDED IN ALL OF YOU KNOW NOT JUST GONNA NOT COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT ANY KIND OF LIKE CT OR OTHER TYPE THAT'S OVER THAT'S CORRECTIVE 60% OF LA USED TO GRADUATE SCHOOL SOMEWHERE. POST SECONDARY 40% DO NOT ENROLL IN ANY POST SECONDARY ENVIRONMENT THAT'S A VERY HIGH RATE OF THE THIRTY TWO OR SO. THOUSAND DAILY WAS THE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SO THAT'S SO THIS PROGRAM IS A ALLOWING US TO AMELIORATE. THAT ISSUE THAT'S WHY ELLIE U. S. THESE IN SUCH A VERY VERY COMMITTED IN STRONG PART IN THE SEPARATE WITH CHANGING THE LIVES OF FAMILIES BY ALLOWING THEM TO GO. TO COLLEGE TUITION FREE YEAH SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S KIND OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TUITION IT'S YOUR POINTS 90%. OF COLLEGE IS NOT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION BUT IT'S A HOOK IT'S FOR HER TO GET THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES YEAH BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT. DECEITFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE SHOWING UP NAY HEY WHERE'S THE REST OF THE DAY WHERE'S THE REST OF MY ADVANCE LAID TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING NO SIR NOTHING JUST ADD ON TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK IS IS IS. ALSO IF YOU CAN STAY LOCAL WHICH YOU SEEN YOUR LOCAL ROMINGER MIA MAYBE YOU CAN STAY WITH FAMILY OR YOU CAN STATE YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO. TO ANOTHER PLACE RIGHT AND AND AND WERE HOUSING MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE IS THAT I MEAN WHAT IF I COULD JUST ADD SOME INTO BOTH YOUR COMMENTS -- IT DEFINITELY IS A HOOK TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT WHAT OUR STUDENTS SAYING ABOUT THE NEXT YEAR THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE'RE HEARING ANECDOTALLY FROM STUDENTS -- OKAY I GOT AND I GOT THIS FIRST YEAR WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO ME NOW SOME OF THE SINCE WILL QUALIFY BOARD GOVERNOR'S VIEW WAIVER WE HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS. BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET ME IN THE DOOR IT'S A HOOK BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY GIVE ME A GOOD CHANCE A COMPLETION AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THE SECOND YEAR. IS SO KEY AND AS WE TRY AND DRIVE DOWN TIME TO COMPLETION MATCHING OUR FUNDING FOR PROMISE IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR TARGET FOR THAT I THINK THERE'S GOOD ALIGNMENT THERE WITH YOUR OTHER INITIATIVES THAT USED TO ORDERED. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ALONG WITH THIS ONE SO. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THE MORE THE STATE COULD DO FOR TUITION AND FEES. THE MORE WE COULD DO WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS TO SUPPORT BOOKS -- AT A COST OF ATTENDANCE TRANSPORTATION THINGS OF THE SUCH BOEING'S RECORDED YOU. WHICH IS A IS A GOOD. ONE AN IMPORTANT WHEN AND THAT AS YOUR LOTUS IS PART OF THE CRITERIA FOR COLLEGE PROMISE PARTICIPATION STUDENTS MUST APPLY FOR BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO RECEIVE ALL THE MAXIM SUPPORTS. OF THAT THEY NEED SO TECHNICALLY THEY COULD RECEIVE NINE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN AID AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW IF THEY'RE FULLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. NOW UNFORTUNATELY ARE IN DOCUMENTS STUDENTS ARE NOT OLDER FOR FEDERAL AID SO WE LOOK TO OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY ARE FOUNDATIONS TO PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORTS THAT. AND DOCUMENTS STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE AND WHICH WE HAVE MANY OF YES SO AS FAR AS THE THE THE AID THE GOOD NEWS IS -- SO MEMBER MEDINA AND MYSELF -- QUIRK SILVA GABRIEL AND BOERNER HORVATH READ AT EVENT AND NINE O'CLOCK AND WE UNVEILED. A MAJOR -- FINANCIAL AID PROPOSAL FROM THE ASSEMBLY RE PUSHING. FOR WE WILL WORK IN LAST COUPLE YEARS TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND FINANCIALLY TO COVER. NON TUITION COSTS FOR ACTUALLY COLLEGES YES YOU YOU SEE AND OTHER CALLS AS WELL SO. THAT'S CERTAINLY IN OUR AGENDA TO TO TO PUSH THIS YEAR -- I YEAH AS THE THE THE OTHER QUESTION THAT -- THAT MR DOLLARS TALKING ABOUT SUCCESS IT'S IT'S NOT JUST MORE IN ROMAN WHICH IS A GOOD THING WE NEED MORE COURSE. YOU KNOW HELPS YOU FINANCE SO YOU'RE DISTRICTS BUT WE NEED MORE. OF PEOPLE WITH THAT COLLEGE EDUCATION DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES BUT YOU'RE SHOWING SUCCESS OF THE STUDENTS GOING FULL TIME. YEAH SELECT THAT RATS BRINKLEY A BIGGER VICTORY BOTH THE HUGE VICTORY -- BECAUSE INCENTIVIZING FOR BECAUSE WE KNOW STUDENTS REMAIN FULL TIME TO COMMITTED THE TASK OF THE DO BETTER THE OUR ELDER ARE ABLE TO STAY ON CAMPUS A LOT MORE TO RECEIVE THE OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORTS AROUND THEM. THE BILL LEARNING COHORTS FULL TIME MATTERS IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SUCCESS FACTOR FOR STUDENTS AND THAT GOES ACROSSINCOMING GOES ACROSS AGE FULL TIME ENROLLMENT. OKAY SO THAT THE REASON WE WE WE INVITED YOU YOU HERE TODAY BECAUSE LIKE. EVERY OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE OVERSIGHT NOT TO JUST. ASK YOU LAWS AND MOVE ON BY TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING IN THE FIRST YEAR AND AND WE WE'VE HEARD STORIES I'VE HEARD FROM MY LOCALS HERE LOS RIOS AT THIS. IS THAT IS SIX TO SUCCESSFUL AND SO WE OF COURSE ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND IT TO YEAR -- TWO WE WERE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY ALL -- FULL TIME NOT JUST FIRST TIME FULL TIME -- BRISTLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- PENCILING OUT OUT AND WE HAD SOME CONFLICTING NUMBERS BACK AND FORTH SO I AS I GUESS THE QUESTION YOU AND ASK YOU HERE TODAY IS ABSENT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND YOU'RE ALL INDEPENDENT AND YOU DISTRICTS ANYWAY -- WHO ARE THERE ANY TWEAKS THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT WITH WITH WITH THIS PROGRAM BESIDES OBVIOUS YOU SUPPORT? YOUR TO ANYTHING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT AND DOING DIFFERENTLY ANY ANY -- MORE FLEXIBILITY LESS FLEXIBILITY THIS IS YOUR CHANCE JUST TO SHARE WITH US ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE FLEXIBILITY I MENTIONED EARLIER IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE FOR US AND I THINK THE THE MATCHING OF OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT IS THE KID IS THE KEY CHALLENGE SO WE ARE DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS STILL. HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THOSE A. B. NINETEEN DOLLARS GET EXPANDED -- WE WOULDN'T BE THERE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FACT THAT WE ARE PRE EXISTING TWO YEAR PRIVATELY FUNDED PROMISE EFFORT. AND SO I THINK THE THE FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD ALTHOUGH THE IDEAL FOR US WOULD BE THAT THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVE THE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY. BUY OUT THOSE FEES ACROSS THE BOARD AND SIMPLIFY THAT SO THAT AS AS WE WE MENTIONED EARLIER YOU WITH THE CREATIVITY THAT THE THAT THE PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS CAN CAN ADD TO THAT -- WOULD BE THE GOAL SO I WOULD SAY IF IF WE COULD DO ANYTHING IT WOULD BE TO MAKE THAT A SIMPLE. FORMULA -- AND THEN TO USE THE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS TO BE THE OUT ON THIS -- AT THIS POINT THOSE ARE NOT REPLACEABLE AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS CLARIFIED EARLY ON A. B. NINETEEN THE CHANCES OFFICE THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A A PROGRAM -- THESE DOLLARS MAYBE NINETY CANNOT BE USED TO BUY THAT OUT AND THEN AND THEN YOU MOVE ON ULTIMATELY IF THIS IS SOLIDIFIED AS AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEN WE CAN GET. THOSE OTHER DOLLARS APPLIED TO THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND SECURITY FOOD AND SECURITY OTHER KINDS OF BRIDGE BUILDING AT SOME CLARIFICATION FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS FAR AS IT WHAT THE ISSUE HE'S RAISING IS THAT. CURRENTLY PERMISSIBLE HELP HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE. THANK YOU WE HAVE -- WE'VE GIVEN DISTRICTS BROUGHT FLEXIBILITY SIDE I DON'T WANT TO CONTRADICT ANYTHING MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED WITH FOLKS BUT I I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL ARE APPROACH HAS BEEN DISTRICTS HAVE -- KIT -- HAVE DISCRETION TO USE AB NINETEEN FUNDS -- AND FURTHER DISCRETION COMPARED TO EXISTING LAW TO USE IT -- FOR FEE WAIVERS. WELL I WOULD ONLY ADD FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. BECAUSE THERE IS IMPACTION AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES AND FRANK THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WHERE MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. ARE BEING TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH ELIGIBLE SEATS AVAILABLE TO THEM HAS SOME KIND OF FORMAL WAY. THAT THEY CAN COME BACK TO US -- AS FIRST YEAR FULL TIME STUDENTS WITH GUARANTEED ADMISSIONS IN A ROMAN THEY GUARANTEE BACK THIRD MISSION A TWO YEARS LATER SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE PROCESS A LOT MORE SEAMLESS. SO THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WORKING TOGETHER. TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF A HIGHER EDUCATED COMMUNITY OF THAT IS CALIFORNIA SOMETHING ALONG. THOSE LINES -- TO TO ECHO ARE VICE CHANCELLOR WE HAVE USED THE FLEXIBILITY QUITE WELL. NOT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SO THAT FOR US IS GOING VERY WELL AND IS AND AND SINCE OUR PARTICULAR NEEDS BUT I'D LIKE. TO PUT THIS I WHAT I BELIEVE IS A MODEL LEGISLATION MODEL PROGRAM IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL. CALIFORNIA THREE TIERED HIGHER EDUCATION SO THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER. YEAH. HAS THE WORK FOR IS IT FIRST TIME LET'S LET'S SAY YOU GO. TO UC SANTA BARBARA FOR A SEMESTER OR A YEAR. LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED. TO GO TO SANTA BARBARA CITY. AND SO DOES IS THAT PERSON AT FIRST TIME IF IT IS IS IS THE FIRST TIME COMMITTEE CALL YOUR FIRST TIME COLLEGE STUDENT. IT'S PERCENT COMMITTEE BECAUSE I AM YES THEY WOULD THEY WOULD THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR THAT WHAT WELL IT JONES. YEAH. YET WHETHER I'M COLLEGE YOUR FIRST TEN MINUTE CALL SPECIAL. I WOULD SAY THE WAY WE'VE BEEN ALLOCATING THE FUNDS IS ON THE BASIS OF FIRST TIME AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE SO IT DISTRICT WOULD GET FUNDS BASED ON THE FIRST OF THE NUMBER OF FIRST TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- AT THE COLLEGE I WILL SAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATUTE WE WEEKS EXPECT THAT DISTRICTS ARE -- ARE AWARDING THE FUNDS. THE WAIVERS TO STUDENTS WHO ARE NON CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISED GRANT ELIGIBLE ONLY TO FIRST TIME -- FULL TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT SAID I THINK THAT'S A YEAH I THINK WE HAVE -- NEED TO DO WORK THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ART A FEW DO NOT MEET THAT REQUIREMENT OR NOT OTHERWISE GETTING FEE WAIVERS I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT OF THE TWO MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IN A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YOU SEE AN FIVE THOUSAND CSU. IT'S NOT ALL LINEAR PERFECT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME TRACK RIGHT IN ALL OF US HAD HAD DIFFERENT A PATH TO TO GET WERE RAT TODAY. AND SO AS WE PUT THESE PROGRAMS -- FOURTH WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS. TRAPPED AND WE HAVE HOW WE HAVE -- FLEXIBILITY IN THIS I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER RIGHT HERE TODAY BUT AS WE LOOK AT EXPAND. THIS THIS PROMISE PROGRAM IS IS WHAT. CAN WE DO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TODAY. IF I COULD ADD ONE ONE SUGGESTION FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT IMPROVE THIS IS. I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN DIFFERENT MESSAGES GOING OUT ABOUT PROMISES ME AND I THINK ONE THING THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT ORGANS DONE IN TENNESSEE IS DONE. IS MORE A UNIVERSAL MESSAGE IT'S COMING I KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A PROPOSED IF FOR SOME SUPPORT FOR THIS UNIVERSAL MESSAGES COMING FROM THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT THIS ACCESS TO TUITION WILL STILL WANT TO HAVE OUR LOCAL MESSAGING. BUT SOMETHING THAT GETS THE WORD OUT TO YOU STUDENTS PARENTS FAMILIES -- TAXPAYERS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THIS IS AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS NOW IN WHATEVER THE CONSISTENT ELEMENT OF IT IS IF IT'S FEE WAIVER FOR THAT'S CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE. THAT CAN NOW LIMIT IN THAT YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS MAY VARY BY CAMPUS I THINK WE COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH OUR DOLLARS AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH OUR MESSAGING IF WE HAD MORE CENTRALIZED EFFORT. INCLUDE F. EXCUSE ME WHY IT MATTERS. WHY IT MATTERS CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO RADICALLY THE TREMENDOUS WEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY GAP THAT EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS? THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT THAT'S A REALLY APPOINTMENTS NOT JUST TO GET IT BUT WHY IT MATTERS TO BE EDUCATED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATE IN. OF THE GIG ECONOMY THE INNOVATION ECONOMY THOSE OTHER TREMENDOUS ASSETS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A WITHOUT THESE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE BUILDING A PERPETUATING -- A SINGLE A WEALTH DISPARITY THAT THAT WE CAN NO LONGER SUSTAIN SO. YOU KNOW MY MESSED IT UP I'D I'D LIKE TO INCLUDE -- WILL. IN YOUR **** THE CONSIDERATION OF THE MESSAGING WHY IT MATTERS FOR CALIFORNIA AND WHY IT MATTERS IN THE EQUITY EQUATION. OKAY YES MISTER MCCARTY AYE I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS SO I HESITATE TO JUMP IN BUT I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW -- I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT EXPANDING THIS -- YOU KNOW TODAY WE COLLECT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION -- AND FEES SO -- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ESSENTIALLY -- EIGHTEEN AN INCREASE DECREASE IN THAT AMOUNT BY ABOUT FORTY MILLION I THINK LARGER EXPANSIONS. YOU KNOW WE'VE COST ABOUT AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO WAIVE TUITION FOR NON FIRST TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE FULL TIME. I THINK THE YOU KNOW. THE RULES OF THE GAME FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN WE WE FUND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THE LEVEL REQUIRED BY PROP NINETY EIGHT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE RULES OF THE GAME BUT TO THE EXTENT TO THOSE REMAIN THE RULES THAT I THINK WE IT I THINK. THERE ARE HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THOSE STOP THOSE DOLLARS DON'T GET BACK FILLED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET SO WHAT WE DO TO SUPPORT THE COST THAT I THINK ARE VERY REAL. FOR FULL TIME FACULTY FOR OTHER COSTS THAT WE ALSO KNOW IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS OF OTHER CULTURES. AND I I WOULD SEPARATE THIS SORT OF EXPERIMENTAL PHASE FROM THE OTHER SO MIGHT MY COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT THE BLESSING AND CURSE OF THAT FLEXIBILITY IS THAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S BEEN A BLESSING TO BE ABLE. TO TO FIGURE IT OUT -- THE CURBSIDE IS THAT COMMUNICATION SIDE AND WHEN ONCE WE'RE CLEAR ON THIS AND THERE IS A LONG TERM FUNDING AT WHATEVER LEVEL OF WEEK WE END UP THAT I WOULD SAY SIMPLICITY IS IS KEY -- I WE WE'VE FOUND THE OF FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION STRUCTURE AND AN INCENTIVE STRUCTURES CRITICAL SO WHATEVER WE LAND ON WE NEED TO MAKE THAT A SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN A NEW PROGRAM OR NEW APPLICATION. SIMPLY USE THE STRONGEST PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AS THEY ARE BOLSTER THOSE AND THEN AND LET THOSE YOU KNOW EXPERIMENTS AROUND THE THE MARGINS OR WITH PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS -- CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD BUT THAT THAT TO ME IS WHERE WE NEED TO GOES AT THAT SIMPLE CLEAR THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS WHY WE DO IT. AND AND GIVE IT AND AND LET THE FLEXIBILITY THEN COME AND AT AT THE WITH WITH OTHER SORT OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE MARGINS. AND THEN DO YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE SOME OF YOUR YOUR CAMPUS MONEY. TO FOCUS ON THE FOR FOR THAT FOR THE NON FIRST TIME STUDENTS WE DO. TWO OTHER FUNDS SOURCES CORRECT YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE THERE SO THAT IS CORRECT. YEAH AND THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN THE STUDENT EQUITY IN ACCESS FUNDS YEAH BUT TO DO THAT WHAT ABOUT JUST GET TO THE OFFICE WITH THE STATE MONEY. IT IS IT WOULD HAVE THE FACT BUT I'M I KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND OBVIOUSLY. BUT WOULD THEY HAVE A CASE BY CASE SITUATION OR HOW WOULD THAT WORK WE HAVE LONG STATE. STATURE REQUIRES COLLEGES TO COLLECT THE ENROLLMENT FEE -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATION THAT SUGGESTS THAT -- USING STATE GENERAL FUNDS WERE UP TO PAY ENROLLMENT FEES WHO ARE NOT OTHERWISE -- FOR HIM BUT ROAMING FEES ARE NOT OTHERWISE WAVE WOULD BE -- IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THOSE LAWS WITHIN CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHETHER COLLEGES CAN USE GENERAL -- FUNDS TO PAY ENROLLMENT FEES WOULD BE -- WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND THAT THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT SORT OF THE AS THE AS THE PHILANTHROPY GUY HERE TODAY WHO WHO'S WHO'S WORKING PRIMARILY ON THAT PRIVATE SUPPORT SIDE YOU KNOW IT PHILANTHROPY IN THE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEM IS VERY NEW -- RELATIVE TO THE FOR YOUR SYSTEM AND AND IT SHOWS UP IN THE NUMBERS ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE DATA POINT I MOST OFTEN REPEAT AS OF LATE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT AMERICANS GIVE TO CHARITY -- WE CROSS FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO GIVE US A TO A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OF THAT THE SECOND LARGEST PIECE GOES TO EDUCATION. THAT'S JUST 14%. BUT ONLY POINT 2% ACTUALLY COMES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YET WE ARE HALF OF THE NATION'S COLLEGE SERVING YOU KNOW SERVING HAVE THIS NATION'S COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO I THINK IF IF WE WANT TO INVEST IN THIS THE FLIGHT WE SHOULD NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR PUBLIC COMMITMENT -- BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN BUILD AND LEVERAGE THE PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THIS SO IF WE GET CLEAR IN MESSAGE WHAT THAT WE ARE DOING AS A FROM THE PUBLIC SIDE THAT THAT IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY THAT WANTS TO SUPPORT HIGHER EDUCATION. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES REALLY SHOULD MOVE TO THE CENTER OF THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO. MISS RECORD IF I COULD WEIGH IN ON HIS. CREDIBLE POINT THERE. IT ALSO DEALS WITH -- FINANCIALLY DISCUSSION THAT YOU'RE LEADING. THAT IS AND THE HERE'S THE POOL OF HEALTH FUNDS AVAILABLE TO ALL AMERICANS. FIFTY OR SO PERCENT OF ALL HIGHER EDUCATION. STUDENTS ARE OUT THE COMMITTEE CALL JUST YET OF THE PILL FUNDS. THE NATION'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT SO WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE THE BILL FUNDS. OF THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE SO THAT IS OUR POLICY DISCUSSIONS THAT ALL LEVERAGE TOGETHER BRAIDED TOGETHER COULD REALLY. MAKE -- TOWARDS ADDRESSING IN ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION. THE COURT COLD ACOSTA CITY HAVE A TENDENCY TO MAKE COLLEGE. YEAH SO I I I I LOVE TO SING THESE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA DOING IT ON THEIR OWN TO HEAR AND WES ACT THEY PASSED A BUT SALES TAX MEASURE IN THERE BEING SOME TO THEIR PROMISE PROGRAM -- IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA YOU'RE DOING IN SANTA BARBARA. AND SO OF COURSE YOU CAN USE THAT MONEY TO TO MAKE YOUR PROGRAMS MORE ROBUST AND AND COVER THAT BOOKS IN. TUITION AND I MEAN I'M SORRY BUT NOT TUITION TO BOOKS. TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH. WHAT DO WE THINK AS FAR AS THE HUNDRED OR SO? COMMITTEE CALL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HOW MANY OF THEM. ARE USING OTHER MONEY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PROMISE FOR HI. SO WE HAVE NOT DONE A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS THERE WAS A RESEARCH DONE LAST YEAR THAT SAID THERE WERE FORTY TWO COMMUNITIES THAT HAD -- PROMISE PROGRAMS THAT LEVERAGE -- BOTH STATE FUNDS BUT OTHER PRIVATE FUNDS. IF AB HALF OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THIS IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE WITH BROAD SUPPORT UP HERE IN. WHERE CERTAINLY GOING TO SUPPORT? THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH YOU KNOW WAS PART OF OUR RECOGNITION TO OUR BILL AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW LOOKING TO STRENGTH AS WELL SO KEEP. US INFORMED HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM. WORK EVEN BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR COMING I THINK YOU. ALL THIS ISSUE OFTEN -- WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY [inaudible] AGENDA ITEM. AND WE ARE GOING -- TO TO TAKE A VOTE ON THIS ISSUE. TRYING TO GET SOME OF OUR MEMBERS BACK HERE WE CAN TAKE A AN AXE ITEM ON THIS. OKAY PLEASE WE GET READY CUTS -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU. SURE MCCARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS THE HEALTH PLAN COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION AND YOUR BONTA STORY FOR FIFTEEN CONTINUING AND FIFTEEN NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE. PROJECTS STATE WIDE. SHOULD THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL BE APPROVED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION OF THE TWO BILLION AND PROP FIFTY ONE FUNDS PROVIDED FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE OBLIGATED. CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT FUNDING STATEWIDE THE PROJECT RECOMMENDED FOR FUNDING ADDRESS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. OF FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES -- AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SOLE REASON FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING IT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER. DETERMINING WHICH PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS WHETHER A REQUESTING DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING MATCH WITH OUR EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENT THE DISTRICT FROM CONTRIBUTING. EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER WOULD INCLUDE REDWOOD COMMUNITY COLLEGE A SMALL DISTRICT WITH SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RESULTING FROM RECENT SEISMIC ANALYSES. OTHER EXAMPLES WOULD BE A RECENT UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT PASSING A LOCAL BOND OR DEMONSTRATING THAT DISTRICT HAS REACHED ITS THE BOND CAPACITY -- CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH CREATES A DISINCENTIVE FOR DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITY -- HOWEVER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NO TO NEED FOR SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION IN STATE FUNDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WELL IN THAT ACCESS OF THE REMAINING ONE POINT THREE BILLION AND PROP -- FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS. THEREFORE WE FIND UNLIKELY THAT COLLEGES OF PURPLE SO THEY ALLOW THEIR BUILDINGS TO FALL INTO DISREPAIR. RISKING THE SAFETY OF ITS STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU EL áREA. I RIVER BRAWL AT THE LEGISLATIVE OF PREDICT TWO RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THIS ISSUE THE FIRST THING WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING MORE -- PROVING MORE PROP FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAN WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WE NOTED THAT -- THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES THE NEWS THE MINISTRATION DOES INCLUDE. MANY MORE PROJECTS IN IN THEIR BUDGET THEM WERE WERE INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS BUDGET UNDER THE BRAND ADMINISTRATION. THE STATE IS STILL ON PRETTY SLOW PACE FOR EXHAUSTING ALL THE PROFITS. FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS THE AT THIS POINT IT'S AT THE BOTTOM NINE YEAR PIECE -- TO TO TO EXHAUST ALL THOSE FUNDS. I'M USED TO THAT WAS THE THE FIRST THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE THE SECOND OR THIRD RECOMMENDATIONS IS GREAT -- TOO ADDRESSES CAN ACT ISSUE OF HOW LIFE SAFETY PROJECT AND HOW LIGHT THE FUSE USED IN EVALUATING -- WHETHER PROJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. I'M THE THE CHANCES OF IT HAS A LONG STANDING PROCESS -- FOR THAT WITH A SORE SEPARATE -- WITH A REVIEW LIVE FIFTY PROJECTS AND THEN ALL THE OTHER PROJECTS ARE ARE EVALUATED BASED ON OTHER NEEDS SUCH AS WHETHER THERE'S A NEED FOR MODERNIZATION OR FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION CAPACITY. I'M THE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ALSO LOOKING AT THROUGH A DIFFERENT LIFE SAFETY LENDS IT LOOKING UP ALL PROJECTS THAT WAY WE JUST CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION FOR DISTRICTS -- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE PROJECT ARE BEING APPROVED IN WHICH PROJECTS ARE GOOD CANDIDATES FOR BEING SUBMITTED. AND WE THINK ALSO -- BY LOOKING AT EVERYTHING TO REALIZE THE VILLAINS ACTUALLY -- MEANS THAT THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH WOULD BE PRIORITIZING PROJECTS. IN DISTRICTS THAT POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE DONE A POOR JOB OF MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE ARE REQUIRE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP ONE AGREED UPON -- CRITERIA FOR HOW TO REVIEW LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS TRUST WHENEVER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I'M STARTING ON PAGE TWELVE OF THE HAND OUT THAT -- DISTRIBUTED EARLIER I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON INFRASTRUCTURE GENERALLY TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS CONVERSATION. YOU ALL EQUIRE US TO PRODUCE A FIVE YEAR CAPITAL PLAN THAT IDENTIFIES NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OUR CURRENT -- PLAN FIVE YEAR PLAN PROJECTS NEEDS -- THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS FOR NEW FACILITIES ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES. CLEARLY THAT -- FAR EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDS -- THAT HAVE BEEN A PER -- AUTHORIZED -- IN RECENT YEARS I COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS PRIMARILY RELY ON LOCAL FUNDS INCLUDING LOCAL BONDS TO MEET THEIR CAPITAL NEEDS THE STATE ALSO PROVIDES CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDS DISTRICTS CAN GENERATE OTHER SOURCES LIKE GIFTS OR DONATIONS. PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OPERATES TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS AND SO -- WHAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR A FOLLOWS THE PROCESS OF PRIVATIZATION THAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THE SYSTEM SO I JUST WANTED TO DESCRIBE A BIT OF HOW THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- PUTS TOGETHER THE REQUEST THAT IT SUBMITS TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TO YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWELVE YOU'LL SEE. OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE A CHART THAT SHOWS SIX CATEGORIES OF PROJECTS. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE SAY IS USING A VERY STRICT DEFINITION OF FIRE LIFE SAFETY ANY. FIRE LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS WHAT WE CALL A CATEGORY A YOU GET INCLUDED IN OUR REQUEST. THAT THE REMAINING DOLLARS THAT WE THINK ARE AVAILABLE FOR THAT YEAR I GET DISTRIBUTED ACROSS A NUMBER FIVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. MOSTLY FOCUSED ON GROWTH AND INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE. WE ALSO INCLUDE A MODERNIZATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE -- A CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES FACILITIES THAT WOULD HELP TO BUILD OUT A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPUS. ABOUT BOTH FOR MODERNIZATION -- CATEGORIES OF INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT AND INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT GROWTH. AND SO TURNING TO PAGE THIRTEEN AS THE PUBLIC SIDE OF ANALYSTS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE OF NOTED ARE SPENDING PLAN THAT WE HAD PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY INCLUDED PROJECTS TOTALING FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE NINETEEN ARE CONTINUING PROJECTS FOR TOTAL COST OF FIVE HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS LARGELY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT PHASES OF THOSE PROJECTS. A BIT OF ALSO INCLUDED THIRTY NINE NEW PROJECTS TOTAL COSTS OF FORTY EIGHT MILLION LARGELY FOR PLANNING AND WORKING DRAWINGS. WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD FUND THAT REQUESTED I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU. SO THIS IS AN ITEM THAT -- OBVIOUSLY -- THE VOTERS -- SPOKE TWO YEARS AGO LOUDLY WHEN THEY PASS THE THE BOND FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION -- FACILITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE LAST YOU BUDGETS HAVEN'T I RECOGNIZE THAT COMMITMENT SO -- WE WE WANT TO DO TODAY IS TO APPROVE THE THE PRO THE THE PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S. INITIAL BUDGET AS WELL AS ADD TO THE OTHER -- PROJECTS IN THE IN THE AGENDA ITEM -- WRITTEN UP BY BY OUR STAFF ON PAGE AT OUR COLLEGES NEED ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN -- IT HERE TO THE WILL OF THE VOTERS CELL WITHOUT LOOKING FOR MOTION. OKAY. WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE AS BUDGETED THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS LISTED ON PAGE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY FOUR SO I WITHOUT EMOTION A SECOND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY.

OKAY YEP YEP GOTCHA -- SO YOU CAN YOU WANT TO CAN YOU OUTLINE A BIT MORE ON THE ON ON THE TWO PROGRAMS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION THE ROLLOUT YEAH THEY'RE ACTUALLY THREE DIFFERENT TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH -- AND THEY ARE AS I MENTIONED MEDICAL CODING ONE IS -- SO IT IS SECOND IS THE FUNDAMENTALS OF IT AND THIRD IS CYBERSECURITY -- WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT MEDICAL CODING ACTUALLY WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE MEMBERS OF S. CI YOU. AS A A GREAT PAYING JOB AND A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR ITS MEMBERS TO GET ADDITIONAL SKILLS. AND TO GET PLACED INTO THOSE JOBS AND I THINK IT'S A VERY INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY -- FOR WORKING WITH WORKING ADULTS AND AND IMPARTING IN IMPRESSING UPON THEM THE FACT THAT -- THIS TRAINING PROGRAM GETS THEM. INTO THE SECTOR OF HEALTH CARE AND PREPARED VERY WELL PREPARED FOR WORKING IN THAT -- SECTOR IN THE FUTURE BUT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY JOBS THAT ARE BEING MADE OBSOLETE THROUGH OBSOLETE THROUGH DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY. AND SO I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ILLUSTRATE TO PEOPLE THAT IT'S NOT THE FINAL DESTINATION IN A JOB BUT IT IS THE STARTING. POINT -- FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF JOBS THAT COULD BE IN THAT SECTOR -- AND AND THE THIS VOTE I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU AND AND SO WE THINK THAT. IT'S INTERESTING -- TO TO REALLY IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE THAT WE ARE WORKING AN ECONOMY THAT IS -- CHANGING EVER MORE RAPIDLY AND THE PEOPLE WILL NEED TO PROVIDE AND ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS TO STAY RELEVANT. AND TO THRIVE AND SO THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ILLUSTRATION -- I THINK OF THAT PARTICULAR POINT. UNLIKE CYBERSECURITY WHICH IS THE SECOND TRACK THAT WE SELECTED WHERE THERE IS -- AN EXPLOSION OF NEW TYPES OF JOBS IN NEW RESPONSIBILITIES EVER IT YOU KNOW INCREASING -- IN THE CYBER SECURITY AREA. BUT YET -- YOU CAN BE AN ADMINISTRATOR LEARN THE FIRST KIND OF LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY PROTOCOL AND INCREASE YOUR SALARY BY SAY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO -- SO THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAINING MODELS -- OR TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF I THINK EXPERIENCES THAT OUR FOLKS WE'LL GET TO THOSE PROGRAMS -- YOU'LL RECALL THAT WE ARE. BUILDING SKILLS UPGRADING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE OVER EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED TODAY. OUR CANCERS OFFICE CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE SEVENTIES ARE KIND. TO FOR TYPE QUESTION. OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR JOB AND I RESPECT THAT AND I KNOW WE HAVE -- YET MANY BECAUSE I INDEPENDENT COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND HAS THERE BEEN ANY FEEDBACK OR PUSHED BACK AT ALL FROM THE DUPLICATION. POTENTIAL. AND AND COMPETITION CHRISTIAN -- I THINK WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW WE HEARD MUCH OF THE FEEDBACK LAST YEAR AS THIS COLLEGE -- YOU KNOW THIS IS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW I THINK -- THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONVERSATION THAT DISTRICTS OFFER -- SIMILAR PROGRAMS I WOULD SAY THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN WHAT WE SEE THE ONLINE COLLEGE OFFERING IS THAT IT'S PROGRAMS WILL BE COMPETENCY BASED IN A WAY THAT -- THE PROGRAMS IN SIMILAR FIELDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AT THE AT THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN -- AS FAR AS THE THE THE STRUCTURE. THAT -- THAT THE FEE STRUCTURE IT IT HAS THAT BEEN SETTLED YETTER W. THE SAME AS THEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE HE STRUCTURE I WOULD DEFER TO UP PRESIDENT HOUSE. THANK YOU -- SO WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A MODEL WHEREBY WE EXPECT AND PLAYERS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO PREPARE. THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW AND THEIR WORK FORCE OF FROM CALIFORNIA FROM THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. AND SO WE ARE PLANNING TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN OUR LEARNERS AND HAVE EMPLOYERS INVEST IN THOSE LEARNERS RATHER THAN PASSING ALONG THE FEES TO THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES -- WE THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO INVEST TONS IN THE FORM OF SWEAT EQUITY AND DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY PAY MORE MONEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE FOR THESE. TRAINING PROGRAMS. I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT THE STATURE DOES CLICK. THE SPECIFIED A CLEAR STANDARD GENERALLY ABOUT THE FEES CHARGED BY THE ONLINE COLLEGE -- CONSIST OF THOSE CHARGED AT THE OTHER COLLEGES I THINK OUR OFFICE HAS A ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THE CASE I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET. SO PAID BY THE EMPLOYER WHAT IF THERE IS NO EMPLOYER WITH AND IF YOU NEED WELL AND TO GET THERE THAT IS ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS -- COMPARED TO A TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE ARE ACTUALLY TRAIN PEOPLE FOR JOBS THAT EXIST -- AS DEFINED BY THE EMPLOYERS AND WE WORK WITH THEM IN THEIR CURRICULA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ARE -- TRAINEES HAVE ACQUIRED THE COMPETENCIES FOR THEIR JOBS WE ALSO ARE BUILDING IN PAID WORK EXPERIENCE OR APPRENTICESHIP INTO OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS -- SO THESE ARE REALLY DRIVEN BY EXISTING JOBS WITH EMPLOYERS AT THE FRONT END AND THROUGHOUT OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. SO THE THEIR PROGRAMS WILL ONLY BE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED AND ESSENTIALLY PARTNER WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORK YEAH AN EMPLOYER CORRECT. YEAH. OKAY AND THEN AS FAR AS THE THAT AND THEN -- I'M SORRY JUST -- TO ADD TO THAT THEN ALSO ARE BUDGET WILL BE GOING OUR INTERNAL FUNDS WILL BE GOING TOWARDS PROVIDING MORE OF WHAT SOME MIGHT CALL WRAPAROUND SERVICES BUT WE BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL. TO OUR LEARNERS BEING SUCCESSFUL ON THE JOB SO THAT IS HAVING COACHING AND A LOT OF LIFE SKILLS TRAINING ON BOTH THE FRONT END OF THE TRAINING AS WELL AS ONCE THEY'RE PLACED INTO THE JOBS. AND THEN HISTORICALLY ONLINE HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN A MIXED BAG -- YOU KNOW FRANKLY FOR STUDENTS. HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE MORE EDUCATION BACKGROUND IT'S BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM. IN STUDENTS WHO ARE. HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WORK AND EDUCATION WHERE THE ALL THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY NAVIGATING AS WE TALK IN OUR PRIOR JEFF PANEL FIRST FIRST GENERATION SEEDS ARE SO FORTH. SO -- OF COURSE OUR STUDENTS SERVICES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY YOU KNOW HOW VALUABLE AND AND AND REALLY NEEDED TO HELP SHE HAS CROSSED THE FINISH LINE. SELL IT ONLINE. YOU KNOW I'LL BE ON YOUR PHONE OR WHAT HAVE YOU. HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK OUT HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS AREN'T SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS. OF WELL AGAIN WE ARE RECRUITING FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING BUT THEY ARE UNDER EMPLOYED. SO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL SKILLS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE BETTER JOBS AND HOPEFULLY ONE JOB WITH BENEFITS RATHER THAN THREE JOBS WITHOUT BENEFITS. SO WE HAVE ARE WORKING WITH A HIGHLY MOTIVATED POPULATION WHO -- WILL NEED BOTH A COMBINATION OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITY -- WITH FLEXIBLE TIME TO BE ABLE -- TO ACQUIRED NEW HARD SKILLS THROUGH ONLINE -- I RAN A PORTFOLIO -- WITH THE BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION WHERE I STUDIED SPECIFICALLY HOW DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION REFORM DIGITAL LEARNING ADVISING AND FINANCIAL SECURITY SUPPORTS EMERGENCY AID FINANCIAL AID WOULD HELP FIRST GENERATION AND UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES COMPLETE COLLEGE I THINK I'M A BIT OF A THE QUESTION IS MORE ABOUT. SUPPORT SERVICES SO THERE ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE JOBS TO GO. TO LA CITY COLLEGE YES THEY STILL. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES NEED THE COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICE NOT THE EDUCATION PIECE AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S THERE AND SO CLEARLY THERE IS THAT E. L. P. OFF A SOON SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS AND POINT THEY A MO JO WHAT HAVE YOU WHEN YOU'RE AT A CAMPUS YES HOW WITH THOSE STUDENTS. BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON THIS VIRTUAL SO THAT OUR TWO THINGS WERE IN ITSELF ANY HELP. TWO ANSWERS THE QUESTION ONE IS THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR PROGRAM IS NOT GOING TO BE FULLY ONLINE. THAT THERE WILL BE IN PERSON CONTACTS BETWEEN -- THIS LEARNER AND A MENTOR AS WELL AS A COACH WHO'S HELPING THEM NAVIGATE THE WORKPLACE LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR SUPERVISORS ALL THE THINGS THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE JOB. AND THESE COACHES WILL BE WITH PEOPLE THROUGHOUT OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS -- FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF AN APPRAISAL PERIOD THROUGH THE ACTUAL TRAINING. BOTH ONLINE AS WELL AS WHILE THEY'RE AT THE WORK SITE AS WELL AS ONCE THEY'RE PLACED INTO THE JOB WAS SUCCESS OFFICERS WORKING WITH THEM. TO CONTINUE TO HELP THEM -- GROW AND DEVELOP AND THEIR JOBS -- AND SO -- AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE SOME OF THE CEOS OF SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES A SPECIFICALLY I'M THINKING OF THE KEVIN WHO RUNS -- COMPTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- SAID YOU KNOW WE ALSO NEED ONLINE TUTORING SUPPORTS AND SO IF YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT SHE GET INTO DURING. THAT WOULD REALLY HELP OUR STUDENTS AS WELL SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED BOTH -- REAL TIME ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND CONTENT FOR FREE THREE DEVICES AS WELL AS A LOT OF FOLKS IN OUR PROGRAM DO NOT HAVE THE NETWORK STEVEN GET INTERVIEWS TO THE RIGHT JOBS. AND WE'RE HERE TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR FIRST PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS. OKAY SOME AMERO DONNA. YES THANK YOU AND I'M. I'M EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT THIS PROGRAM I HEAR SOMETHING NEW I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN OUT OF CLASSROOM EXTRA -- OFFLINE EXPERIENCE YEP -- SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SO SO YOU'VE CITED -- REITER STARTING ON MEDICAL CODING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT. AND CYBERSECURITY AND FIRST LINE SUPERVISION SO THOSE ARE AVAILABLE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL THE WILL OF THE QUICK BUT THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE. BECAUSE THAT WAS THE WHOLE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM. THAT'D BE SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE. AT AT AT YOUR STANDARD YOU A COLLEGE ONLINE. IT IS I THINK WE WOULD SAY THE COMMITMENT -- WE AGREE THAT THERE. YEAH THIS WAS THE CONCERN THE COMMITMENT WAS THAT PROGRAMS DESIGNED IN THIS WAY WOULD NOT BE OFFERED AT THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED AT OTHER COLLEGES. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS FIRST FULL MEMBER -- DOWNLOAD LEFT TAKE KNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT -- LIKE ANY OTHER START UP THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF GREAT INTENTIONS AND A BROAD OUTLINE THAT WERE CREATED BEFORE I WAS HIRED. BUT NOW THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE DETAIL AND I'D BE DELIGHTED TO COME AND SHARE AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE WHERE WE ARE. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR NEW INFORMATION EVERY SINGLE TIME IN FRONT OF YOU SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT TO YOU. ON THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE MEDICAL CODING PROGRAMS AND ALSO CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMS TAUGHT AT OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT NOT IN THE WAY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED THAT IS HAS EMPLOYERS ON THE FRONT END WE'RE WE'RE TRAINING THEM FOR SPECIFIC JOBS THAT EXIST FROM THE EMPLOYERS. AND THAT INCLUDES -- APPLIED LEARNING EXPERIENCES PLUS COACHING ON THE BACK END OKAY AND UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING BECAUSE I HAVE A DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE CONCEPTS AND REALLY THE PROMISES THAT WERE MADE AS THIS WAS. DEVELOPED ARE CAN. GRAHAM I'M GETTING AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DELIVERABLES ACCORDING TO THE STATUTE AND WE'RE ABIDING BY ALL OF US I'M NOT JUST ABOUT STATURE HAMAS ABOUT INTENT. AND AND WE HAVE AN EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS JUST GO ON YOU SIR. THEIR ROLE THAT'S WHAT RIGHT I MEAN I'M IN I'M GOING TO REMAIN I REMAIN I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I REMAIN VERY CONCERNED. THAT THIS MAY YOU SERVE THE ROLE. OF OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHEN THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE POINT OF DISCUSSION IN THIS ROOM. IN AND OUT OF THIS ROOM AS THIS WAS A THIS WITH THIS WAS CONTEMPLATED BUT I WILL JUST -- YOU KNOW I THINK. MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WORK IS NOW TRANCE. TRANSFER TO THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AS OTHER COLLEGES BUT I THINK A ROLE FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO PLAY IS TO COMMUNICATE BE COMMITMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE. OUGHT TO THE COLLEGES LEADERSHIP AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DIRECTION -- IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE I COMMITMENTS OR THAT WE COME HERE AGAIN AND AND TO THE EXTENT WE DEVIATE FROM THOSE COMMITMENTS -- MAKE THAT CLEAR TO YOU ALL AND AND SEE SHOULDN'T DEVIATE FROM THIS GOVERNMENT'S. MANY BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE OKAY THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MAKING THAT POINT. SO SO NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COACH IS THAT AND INSTRUCTORS THAT WOULD SOMEONE CERTIFIED IS AT SOME WITH SOME LEVEL OF EDUCATION IS THAT SOMEONE IN STATE IS THAT SOMEONE SITTING IN. IN TEXAS ONLINE TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THAT. THAT WAS THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS WHICH ARE WE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE TEACHING FROM FAR AWAY. THAT MAY NOT EVEN HAVE CERTIFICATIONS WERE RECRUITING ALL OF OUR WORK FORCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M A CALIFORNIA NATIVE BORN IN LA -- ATTENDED UC BERKELEY BUT I'VE BEEN HERE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BUSINESS SCHOOL FOR OVER -- FOOTBALL FROM MY FIFTY YEARS OF LIFE SO -- WHEAT BUT WE ARE RECRUITING EXCLUSIVELY CALIFORNIANS FOR OUR JOBS. AND SO THERE WAS AT THE HEAD HUNTER CONTRACT WHAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR IT WAS -- IT ACTUALLY FINISHED. THERE WAS A HEAD HUNTER CON WELL I DON'T KNOW IT WASN'T A CONTRACT ON OF A SOLE SOURCE HOUSE ON WHATEVER SOLE SOURCE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR. DEAL I DON'T KNOW -- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD EVEN BE LEGAL. BUT THERE WAS A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT OF SO IT WASN'T A CONTRACT I DON'T KNOW JUST HANDSHAKE I DON'T KNOW. TO TO AN INDIVIDUAL FOR FIRST THAT JUST FOR SEVEN POSITIONS TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT WALK ME THROUGH WHERE THEY WANT TO THIS [inaudible] I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY GOODNESS FOR THE SO IS THAT ACCURATE OR SENT THAT IS NOT ACCURATE EXACTLY -- SO FIRST OF ALL WE I RETAINED A RECRUITER -- AS IS LEGAL TO ENGAGE WITH A FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT WITH A RECRUITER -- AS I MENTIONED TO YOU -- ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB ALMOST THREE MONTHS NOW -- IN ORDER TO GET OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING BY OCTOBER FIRST THEN HIT ALL THE OTHER MILES THE STONES MANDATED THIS YEAR -- I NEED A FULL TEAM IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK STATEWIDE -- AND I WANTED TO FIND A RECRUITER WHO COULD WORK WITH ME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE A LOT OF RECRUITERS I'VE I'VE TALKED WITH -- TO HIRE -- SEVEN SIX SENIOR LEVEL POSITIONS COULD SPEND AS MUCH AS A YEAR DOING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE YEAR. SO I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO RICKY ENGAGE RECRUITERS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- IS FULLY LEGAL TO DO SO AND OUR CONTRACT ENDED UP BEING -- ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND AND IN TOTAL -- SOME SO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN INITIALLY THE UP. UPWARDS AMOUNT -- WAS INITIALLY CAPTAIN APPROVED BY MY BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT AT OVER MAY HAVE BEEN TOTALLY LEGAL I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I READ I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS GOOD GOOD PRACTICE ARE GOOD POLICY. WE WILL BE GOING -- TO TO THE FULL STATE -- FOR ALL VENDORS TO RESPOND IN OUR R. F. P. FOR THE ACTUAL TRAINING PROGRAMS -- GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THAT I'VE JUST WE ARE OUT THAT WE WILL BE TIME AND YEAH HEAD HUNTER EXACTLY -- CRUDER TO TO FIND AN EXECUTIVE TEAM STATEWIDE EVEN CORRECT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ONE TIME HEAD HUNTER DEAL. THAT I READ ABOUT. AND I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT DEAL WITH LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. THANK YOU. THE LETTER LIMóN ON THIS TOPIC I AM. WHAT I HEARD AND AND I REMEMBER BEING IN THE HEARINGS LAST YEAR AND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS THAT THIS WOULD NOT [inaudible] REPLICATE. ANY COURSES OFFERED. THE NEW ONES THAT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT. IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE HOW IS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFF LIKE YOU DON'T NECESSARY SAY IT WASN'T THE RIGHT SAME COURSE YOU SAID IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT DEFINITION THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IS USING TO DEFINE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE SAME COURSE BECAUSE A MEAN CERTAINLY THERE WAS APPROVAL FOR IT BUT THERE WAS. ALSO VERY CLEAR INTENT OF WHERE WE WANTED TO GO AND I THINK THIS NEW WANTS CAN ACTUALLY -- MAKE US RETHINK ABOUT WHETHER THE INTENT IS BEING MET OR NOT. IT CAN BE DEFINED. IN ANY LEGAL WHERE WHICH WAY BUT AGAIN A THINK FOR THOSE OF US THAT WERE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR THAT. WE WERE VERY CLEAR. YEAH BUT IT'S I WOULD SAY FROM -- YOU KNOW THE STATUTE DOESN'T INCLUDE A STANDARD SO I THINK THE COMMITMENT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS TO YOU ALL INTO OUR COLLEGES THAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING A COLLEGE THAT -- THAT IS GOING TO COMPETE FOR STUDENTS. ABOUT THEIR ALSO SERVING AND SO I WOULD SAY THE VERY CLEAR LINE AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD IT BUT I THINK -- YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WE WILL COME BACK AND TELL YOU IS THE COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION -- THAT IT IS EITHER DIFFERENT FIELDS ALL TOGETHER OR THE DELIVERY IN COP AS A COMPETENCY BASED -- FORM OF LEARNING -- IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS OFFERED AT OTHER COLLEGES [inaudible] SO. YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IF YOU CAN FIND A WORK AROUND TO OFFERING THE SAME COURSE BECAUSE IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT THE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA BUT I WANT TO JUST BE VERY SPECIFIC BUT AS I UNDERSTAND. THE CONVERSATIONS IT IS SPEND THAT IS IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS OFFERED AS COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND THAT'S WHY BY THE LEADERSHIP AND AS A CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED BY THE BY THEIR LIKE COLLEGE. IF I MAY UM THE FIRST PROGRAM AND AND THAT'S WHY I ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE DETAIL OF MEDICAL CODING IS CHANGING AS A WHOLE CAREER AN OPTION. THAT ACTUALLY WAS SELECTED PRIOR TO MY BEING -- HIRED IT WAS SELECTED BECAUSE IT WAS -- MOST POPULAR WITH SCA USE MEMBERSHIP THEY CONSIDER THOSE WELL PAYING JOBS THAT THEY WANTED TO GET THE SKILLS AND TRAINING IN AND WE WANTED A FREE OFFERING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY COUNTER. THE FOR PROFITS WERE CHARGING PEOPLE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO LEARN TO BE MEDICAL CODERS AND THEY'LL NEVER GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT DEBT -- SO THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF ABOUT THE ORIGIN I WILL SPEAK FROM -- MY THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE BOTH IN EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT HAVING CONFIDENCE IN SEAT COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE HARD FUNCTIONAL SOFT SKILLS. REQUIRED TO DO THAT JOB IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MEDICAL CODING CURRICULA -- IT CURRICULA EXPERIENCE THAT ONE ONE GET A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT QUESTION I MEAN THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE THAT WAS THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST YEAR -- THAT VERY CLEARLY BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE LOOK THERE'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. DIDN'T NECESSARILY LOVE THIS PROPOSAL AND I MEAN THAT THIS IS NOT A SECRET AND SO I THINK THAT AS THE PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THIS IS AN AND I GOTCHA GAME NO ONE TRIED WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY HAPPENED THAT IS PART. OF THE ROLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PLEASE -- AND SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT ANYONE. YOU KNOW WANTING TO DO SOMETHING WRONG OR GOING EAST AS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK THESE POINTED QUESTIONS HELP US UNDERSTAND -- WE WERE ALREADY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS AS A LEGISLATURE ON WHETHER THIS WAS THE RIGHT MOVE OR NOT -- AND I SUSPECT THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASK THIS LEVEL OF QUESTION -- AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OUR SKEPTIC IT'S A SKEPTICISM WAS EIGHT YOU KNOW IT MERITED OR NOT AND IF IT'S NOT IT'S GREAT LIKE IF IT'S IF IF WE FIND. THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A BETTER PATH TO MOVE FORWARD IN AND WE ARE REALLY LIKING IT I THINK THAT'S GREAT WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- I WOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE CHAIR BUT I COULD BE A LOAN IN THIS MAYBE IT'S JUST ME -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS THEY SENSE SLIGHT DEFENSIVENESS AND I THINK IT'S MORE A SENSE OF REALLY TRYING TO ASK I KNOW THERE HARD QUESTIONS I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT I HAVE A THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST ASK THEM -- AND INTO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE AT SO THAT WE CAN ALSO WE ALL GO BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. AND SO I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE THE BETTER. AND I HOPE I WOULD JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I I HOPE YOU DON'T CENTS DEFENSIVENESS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I WOULD JUST SAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER COLLEGES WE YOU KNOW THE THE WORK OF THE ONLINE COLLEGES BEING HANDLED BY THE DISTRICT LED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES -- BUT I DO THINK THAT AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT I'M. WITH YOU KNOW THERE IS A SET OF STATUTES THAT WE EXPECT THE ONLINE COLLEGE TO COMPLY WITH THERE ARE ALSO WE KNOW COMMITMENTS THAT WE MADE TO OTHER COLLEGES IN OUR SYSTEM AND DO YOU ALL THAT WE WILL -- YOU KNOW THAT WE INTEND TO BE A VOICE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE COLLEGES LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THAT THOSE COMMITMENTS WERE MADE. WELL I THINK THE ISSUE IS IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HOW STUDENTS ARE. SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS AND THEY'RE HUNGRY YEAH AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM HERE THAT NOT A LOT OF US LIKE WE COULD EASILY TAKE A MOTION AND ELIMINATE THIS PROGRAM WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A DESIRE TO HAVE THIS BUT THE PRIOR GOVERNOR. WAS INTERESTED IN THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAVE HEARD WHEN WHERE THE OTHER ANOTHER CHANCELLOR REALLY LIKES THIS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND WE'RE KIND OF GOING. ON A WIN HERE SO -- IF WE DID CONTINUE THIS WIN WOULD WITH WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WE BE REASSURED THAT THIS IS A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENTS WHEN WE COULD EASILY -- REDIRECT THESE MONIES AND HELP STUDENTS BE ABLE. TO EAT TODAY AS OPPOSED TO GO HUNGRY WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO CLASS YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE EIGHT BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORKING THREE AND FOUR JOBS AND THEY STILL CAN'T EAT PROPERLY. NOR CAN THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY AND SO I THINK THAT THOSE PEOPLE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GET BETTER JOBS. AND I NO NO NO NO I I YEAH A LITTLE WE SEE SIX DEL OCTOBER ONE IS WHEN OUR FIRST TRAINING PROGRAMS GO LIVE. AND I THINK -- THAT YOU'LL NEED AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS THROUGH THOSE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS WE ARE STARTING TO CREATE AND DEVELOP WITH OTHER EMPLOYERS. IT I MEAN YOU KNOW. I THINK YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING ACTUALLY THERE TO HAVE. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE OR TO APPRECIATE THAT IT'S CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING TO THE MINISTER SERLING WEEK I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE ARE NOT. PROPERLY RUNNING AND ARE AS A BIG LINE. OUTSIDE THE DOOR A LOOKING -- TO LOOK LOOK AT EXPENDITURES IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SOME THIS IS A ELEMENT AND I'M -- YOU YOU'VE HEARD FROM -- FROM -- BOTH PARTIES BOTH HOUSES AS FAR AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE -- ABOUT THESE ENDEAVORS GOING FORWARD SO WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. OKAY -- HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN ISSUE NUMBER FIVE BASIC NEEDS. I AM GONNA START US OFF AND I AM SHOWING BY MY COLLEAGUE CALLING CANLEY WHO IS. RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OFFICES WORK ON ISSUES LIKE BASIC NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH AND AND OTHER PRESSING ISSUES OUR STUDENTS SPACE -- I'M STARTING ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE HAND OUT. BY THE SAME POWER POINT -- DECK THAT WE SHARE EARLIER I THINK JUST TO KIND OF PUT THIS. RECESSION IN CONTEXT OF THE HOPE CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE DID A SURVEY -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR OFFICE LAST YEAR -- FAILED THAT HALF OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY WERE FOOD IN SECURING THE PRIOR THIRTY DAYS 60% WERE HOUSING AND SECURED 19% WERE HOMELESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AND SO AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR I THINK THIS IS A AND ESPECIALLY PRESSING ISSUE FOR US TO CONSIDER HOW TO WE SUPPORT -- STUDENT SUCCESS WHILE OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING -- CHALLENGES REGARDING THEIR BASIC BOTTOM OF PAGE. FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS -- ON RELATED ISSUES IN RECENT YEARS -- PROPERTY IN TWO AND A HALF MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TEN MILLION IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF HOW COLLEGES ARE USING THOSE FUNDS A HUNDRED THIRTEEN COLLEGES HAVE A FOOD PANTRY OR OTHER -- FORMS A FEW DISTRIBUTION ON CAMPUS SEVENTY THREE COLLEGES PROVIDE CAL FRESH. INFORMATION SYSTEMATICALLY SIXTY COLLEGES HAVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH CAL FRESH STAFF TO ASSIST STUDENTS WITH THEIR BASIC NEEDS. BOB JUST MAYBE KIND OF GOING TO THE NEXT PAGE LOOKING AT A KIND OF A BROADER VIEW WE THINK COLLEGES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN -- AND HELPING STUDENTS -- MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS OUR STUDENTS ARE PART COLLEGES CAN USE THEIR STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA RESOURCES STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM RESOURCES AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THERE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT FUNDS TO SUPPORT THESE. BOB I FIX WHAT WE WOULD ARGUE IS THAT THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM THOUGH -- THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS PRIMARILY TO THE FINANCIAL AID THAT'S NECESSARY -- TO TO COVER THE TRUE COST OF COLLEGE. WE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR WORK ON FINANCIAL AID REFORM IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIFTEEN WE HAVE A BILL THAT WERE SPONSORING SB TWO NINETY ONE BY SENATOR LEYVA. THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THAT GETS SQUARELY UP THIS PROBLEM OF DRESSING AT THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDANCE NOT ONLY TUITION BUT ALSO FOOD HOUSING TRANSPORTATION OTHER COSTS THAT STUDENTS SPACE. WHILE THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE IF YOU LOOK ON THE RIGHT -- UNDER SB TWO NINETY ONE THE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID WOULD BE CALCULATED BY LOOKING UP AT TRUE COSTS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE SUBTRACTING OUT WHAT WE EXPECT THE STUDENT FAMILY TO PAY. SUBTRACTING OUT WHAT WE THINK. WITH THE STUDENT ALREADY RECEIVED ANOTHER GRANTED -- THAT WOULD BE A NEW GRAD CREATED BY THE THE NEW FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. SO OUR REQUEST FOR THE COMMITTEE. WOULD BE TO SUPPORT SB TWO NINETY ONE FOR OTHER LEGISLATION THAT DOES US -- BUT IT CHIEF THE SIMILAR GOAL. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN TERMS OF A BUDGET REQUEST IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY THE THE OTHER HAND OUT THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE IT CLOSES -- IS OUR PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE BASIC NEEDS FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED IN RECENT YEARS. AND I AM BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN ASSEMBLY BILL I DOES THAT A SONG. AND THIS IS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. RIGHT THE SO WE WE SAW THE BILL TODAY MEDINA IS BILL LONG WITH -- MISTER MCCARTY HERE SO WE CAN YOU CAN PROPERLY SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY BILL THE HAS THE EXACT SAME LANGUAGE AS THIS. AS THE SENATE BILL PLUS OUR BILL HELPS UC CSU STUDENTS SO WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING WE WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF FINANCIAL AID REFORM -- THERE ARE PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE -- YOU KNOW BE I WOULD JUST NOTICE I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT THE SAME LANGUAGE I RECOGNIZE ECHOES -- IT IT REFORMS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IN A BROADER WAY I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WERE DEFINING TOTAL COST IN SIMILAR WAYS. THAT WE'RE COVERING SIMILAR GROUPS OF STUDENTS -- IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO US. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- BUT ATTENDED -- WITH A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION GOAL THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE TREATED SIMILARLY UNDER -- UNDER A REVISED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM AND SO I WOULD SAY WE ARE HAPPY -- TO TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT. INCLUDING YOURS THAT MEETS THOSE PRINCIPLES AND I WOULD -- YOU KNOW I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE NEED TO IN THIS BUDGET WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL. RECOGNIZE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS UNDER CURRENT FINANCIAL AID STRUCTURE ARE TREATED THE MOST INEQUITABLE ACROSS SEGMENTS YEAH WE CONCUR WITH THAT WE HEARD FROM THE LA CHANCELLOR. AN HOUR AGO. THAT OVER 90% OF THE COSTS FOR COMMUNITY CALLED STUDENT. IS A NON TUITION AND SO THAT'S THE FINANCIAL AID PIECE THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T. ADDRESS THAT POPULATION SO BUT I WOULD JUST EITHER WAY WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND I WOULD ARGUE IT'S BOTH NOT JUST THE BENEFIT LEVEL NOT THE HOW MUCH EACH STATE WOULD RECEIVE BUT ALSO THE ELIGIBILITY THAT OF YOU KNOW WE OFTEN SAY HALF OF STUDENTS RECEIVE. A COLLEGE PROMISE GRANTS ALL LESS THAN 5% RECEIVE CAL GRANTS BECAUSE CAL GRANTS TODAY SAY IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE YOU NEED TO ENTER COLLEGE NO MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND SO CALM. SO I THINK ONLY INCREASING THE BENEFIT LEVEL FOR CURRENT CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MOST OF OUR NEEDY STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVE THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES OF OUR PROPOSAL TODAY. GET RID OF THAT H.. ARBITRARY AGE CAP [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] OKAY -- YES SO THESE ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY OTHER -- ISSUES THAT -- WE WANT TO ADDRESS AS FAR FOCUSING ON OTHER THAN THE TRUE REALITIES OF COLLEGE STUDENTS -- IT'S AS HEARTBREAKING TO READ THE STORIES ABOUT STUDENTS SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS AND AND NOT HAVING -- ADEQUATE FOOD TO FOCUS ON THEIR STUDY SO. YOU KNOW SOMEONE EVER NOW. OKAY HI THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING -- TO CERTAINLY MONITOR WE WERE YOU KNOW SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSALS. IN THE BUDGET FOR THE OTHER SEGMENTS AND YOU KNOW SUB SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS FINAL BUDGET GOING FORWARD OKAY. THANK YOU -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT BEFORE THAT WE CAN DO THE ADD ONS FOR THE ONE ACCIDENT TODAY THIS IS THE APPROVING. THE CAPITAL OUTLAY. PROPOSALS IN ADDITION. THE THE THE ITEMS OUTLINES WE'RE GOING TO ADD ON IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY -- THE GENDER PACKAGE MR MURATSUCHI [inaudible] SIR BRO [inaudible] OKAY. WITH THAT WILL PROCEED WITH OUR PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] THIS YEAR'S. GOOD MORNING MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND WE'RE GLAD WITH OUR WITH THE CONVERSATION TODAY ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AS THE HOPE CENTER SURVEY REVEALED 50% AND 60% OF STUDENTS RESPECTIVELY ARE FACING FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. AND WE NEED STOP GAP MEASURES REAL FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND A STATE COMMITMENT TO DO SURVEYS LIKE THESE TO REGULARLY LIFT UP BARRIERS FACED. BY OUR FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THIS COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON LAURA AS ABA CUBITS WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. OUR ANALYSES HAVE FOUND THAT DO DIA HI NON TUITION COSTS AND INSUFFICIENT NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN BE LESS AFFORDABLE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE SAME REGION. AND AT SEVERAL COLLEGES THE STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN THIRTY HOURS PER WEEK TO COVER NOT COSTS. LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED HAVE ALWAYS HAD THEIR FEES WAIVED WITH OVER BEYOND TUITION AND FEES. AND AS WE'VE JUST HEARD HIGH SHARES OF STUDENTS REPORTING BOTH FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS COLLEGES TO HELP NEEDY STUDENTS BETTER COVER NON TUITION COSTS AS THIRTY SCHOOLS CURRENTLY DO WITH THE COLLEGE PROMISE. THIS IS INTEGRAL TO IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES AND REDUCING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS TWO OF THE KEY LEGISLATIVE INTENSE OF THE ORIGINAL PROMISE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. OUR IS IT AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKINGTHE ACTION THAT YOU JUST TOOK TO APPROVE. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY ITEM -- WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD BE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SPENDING PLAN WE ALSO ECHOED THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REGARDING HOW DISTRICTS ARE CONFUSED BY THESE TWO COMPETING STANDARDS. AND TO WHICH PRIORITY THE PROJECTS ARE BEING EVALUATED WHEN VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE THAT THEY APPROVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR MORE THAN JUST HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS. FOR CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION RECONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPPING OF IMPORTANT FACILITIES -- THE DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE DOES MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGES TO PLAN. THEIR BOND PROGRAMS AND THEIR PROJECTS AND WE DON'T SEE A GOOD POLICY REASON WHEN THE DEMAND IS THERE TO DELAY PROP. FIFTY ONE ULTIMATELY FACILITIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS OTHER PRIORITIES INCLUDING STUDENT SUCCESS INCREASING ACCESS TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOUR SPEECH ON CAPITAL OUTLAY REMINDING ME THAT WE NEED TO ADD ON I MISTER GALLAGHER TO THE VOTE THERE FOR PROP FIFTY ONE CAP LOUDLY. THIS CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. OKAY THANK YOU. HELLO KATRINA LINDA WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUED FOR LIMITATION THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. WE NEED A FINANCING METHOD FOR COLLEGES THAT REFLECT STATE PRIORITIES AROUND ACCESS ALSO STUDENT SUCCESS IN EQUITY. THERE ARE PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN PLACE TO ENSURE COLLEGES DO NOT CREATE LOW VALUE CREDENTIALS OR WAR DUPLICATE AGREES. WE ALSO DO BELIEVE THERE IS A PREMIUM VALUE TO THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER WHICH HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS TRANSFERRING GRADUATE IN A MORE TIMELY AND AFFORDABLE MEANS AN OTHERWISE. THE NEW FINING FORMALIZE A FINANCIAL EXTENSION OF THE STUDENT CENTERED APPROACH OUTLINED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS ADOPTED FOR COLLEGES. AND WE URGE THAT YOU REMAIN COMMITTED TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION THANK YOU. EVERYBODY -- I SAID THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THIS -- JOIN ANY HEARING.

GOOD AFTERNOON TERM MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DOLLARS DAVIS AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE ECONOMIC CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WELL THE ECONOMICS AND FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONTINUES TO OPPOSE PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING WE HAVE PROPOSED SEVERAL AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. CAN BE AMENDED TO BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS BY HOLDING PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING AT 10% ONLY COUNTING A STUDENTS HIGHEST AWARD ANNUALLY. AND LEVELING ALL ASSOCIATES DEGREES WITH THE SAME POINT TOTAL WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST CONCERNS ABOUT THE STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING FORMULA WILL BE AMELIORATED TO A DEGREE. WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE THE ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY ALL DESERVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DEAN MARCOM A PERSONAL THOSE SERVICE CALLS FEDERATION TEACHERS I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE A COUPLE THINGS. ONE IS THE THREE AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IN THE FUNDING FORMULA. AND THE STUDENT -- THE SINCE EXCESS PART OF IT. PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING DOES NOT WORK. NUMBER ONE ALL THE TWEAKS AND ALL THE CHANGES AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING ON DOESN'T ADDRESS TO SHORTFALL AT ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO DRESS. ANYTHING THIS THIS DEMONSTRATES HOW POORLY CONCEIVED AND PUT TOGETHER THIS FUNDING FOR IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE. PERSONALLY I THINK WE SHOULD GET RID OF THIS PART OF THE PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING. THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT. YOU KNOW YES IN TERMS OF OUR STUDENTS -- LIKE WE SAID FROM NOW -- HOPE OF THE HOPE OF LAB -- STUDY. HOW FOR STUDENTS ARE THE FOOD INSECURE ARE ARE HOMELESS OR HOME INSECURE? THAT REPRESENT A LOS REALISM OR I I TEACH OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. ACROSS THE STATE THAT REPRESENTS OVER A MILLION STUDENTS. THERE EITHER FOLK FOOD INSECURE OUR HOME IS SECURE THAT IS A PERVASIVE TREMENDOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE THAT WE NEED TO FACE. BECAUSE THESE ARE CRITICAL BEARS JUSTIN SUCCESS I DON'T CARE HOW WHAT KIND OF PATH FOR YOU HAVE IF YOU CAN'T EAT YOU DON'T HAVE A HOME YOU'RE TALKING THIS SUCCESSFUL AND AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

HELLO MY NAME IS KYLE PATEL AND I'M A THIRD YEAR STUDENT AT DE ANZA COLLEGE -- I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES AND WHY I BELIEVE THAT PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING IS DETRIMENTAL TO COMMUNITIES AND ALIENATES THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT BASE. SO A BIT OF AN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF FIRST ON OVER A DE ANZA COLLEGE WE'RE CURRENTLY HAVING A LOT OF COURSE SHORTAGES. AND WERE IS SEEING INSTRUCTORS ADDING STUDENTS PACKED UP TO BUILDING CAPACITY JUST TO ENSURE THAT SOME OF THEM CAN MAKE IT INTO THEIR OUT TO YOUR TRANSFER DEADLINE. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL THE STUDENTS SO THERE ARE A LOT BEING LEFT BEHIND. ON THESE STUDENTS THERE ARE PARENTS ARE SERVICE WORKERS ARE VETERANS AND THEIR RETURNING PROFESSIONALS TO HELP STAY CURRENT ON THEIR INTEREST IN THEIR INDUSTRIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI KEVIN RITCHIE DANS A COLLEGE -- IT AGAIN ON PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING IT SURE -- SERVES TO TRYING CREATE THIS VISION OF AN IDEA OF A UNREALISTIC COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT FITS A PERFECT MOLD OF BEING EIGHTEEN FRESH AT A HIGH SCHOOL BEING SUPPORTED BY THEIR FAMILY GOING STRAIGHT TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF BEING PUSHED OUT IN TWO YEARS -- AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE LIBERTY OR PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE. TO GO THROUGH SUCH AN EXPERIENCE -- MANY OF US HAVE TO SUPPORT OURSELVES WITH THE JOBS OR HAVE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES THAT MAY TAKE A MAY TAKE PRECEDENT OVER SCHOOL AT THAT TIME. SO A PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING IS CLEARLY NOT IDEAL FOR OUR SITUATIONS AND NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY ABOLISHED NOR. TO IN ORDER -- TO IT SORRY -- WE WE DO ASK THAT YOU COMPLETELY ABOLISHED FORMS FACE FUNDING SO YOU MAY -- ASSIST ALL THE PEOPLE THAT AND THAT MAY NEED THIS ASSISTANCE. THANK. HELLO I AND MICHELLE HA I AM A STUDENT FROM THE ENDS AS WELL. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF A COLLEGE THAT THIS PERFORMANCE SPACE FINDING WITH THAT FACT -- SO WHERE IN THE HEART OF THE SILICON VALLEY THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS AND THERE IS A LOT OF SUCCESSAT THE END SO -- WE ARE TALKING TRANSFERS AND WE'RE SENDING STUDENTS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS OF COLLEGES. BUT EVEN THEN. A LOT OF MY FRIENDS MY CLOSE FRIENDS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR CLASSES BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A SHORTAGE ESPECIALLY FIRST IMAGES THEY CAN'T GET OUT IN THE TWO YEARS. THEY CAN'T GET THE CERTIFICATE TIME LIKE WE SAID THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH AWARDING FINDING BASED ON CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER. BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES VISION. AND WE'RE HERE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. AND JUST THAT TRADITIONAL STUDENT. IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKE THEY HAVE SAID THERE'S SO MANY MORE.
