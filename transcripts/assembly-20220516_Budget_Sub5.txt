FOR ME PROCEED I WANTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE TIRELESS WORK ON PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WERE IN THEIR INSIGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS INTO OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT STAFF FOR MAKING A RITUAL HEARING POSSIBLE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC FOR PARTICIPATING- AND INFORMING. OUR DELIBERATIONS. THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY EVERY BEING TWO HUNDRED BUDGET CHANGES. TURNED A BUDGET CHANGE RIPPLES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS. AT THE SCEPTER OVER ISSUE THE PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE OUR PRIORITIES ARE MANY LA TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THAT I BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE COMMUNITY SAFETY FOR ALL. WE STARTED THE YEAR OFF WITH THE HEARING ON SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR SURVIVORS OF CRIME. I PART IN TO SEE THAT THE MAYBE VICE INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION. FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS THAT PROVIDE A TEXAS CRITICAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS OF THEIR LIFE FINALLY IF THAT WAS A COMPREHENSIVE STATE AGENCY. THAT CAN BETTER SERVE THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF SURVIVORS OF CRIME WITHOUT SUBJECTING THEM TO UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY. ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DISRUPT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND THE REVOLVING DOOR FOR CONSERVATION CALIFORNIA HAS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS AND SUCCESSFUL MODELS LIKE PROJECT REBOUND. THAT INVEST IN THE POTENTIAL OF PEOPLE TO TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS THAT WILL LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR GOOD. FINALLY WHAT WE SPEND. AS HE SPENT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON SETH. JERRY ASKED WE SPENT HOW WE SPENT OUR FOR DOLLARS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WE CHOOSE NOT TO SPEND MONEY ON PROPOSALS THAT INCLUDE ACCOUNTABILITY BASED ON RESEARCH IMPACT PRACTICES THAT ARE OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE AND THE RESPONSE ARE CRITICAL NEED IDENTIFIED BY CALIFORNIA OR WHAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING. IN WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A PROPER CONTROLS IN PLACE TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE THE WASTING OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A MANY CRITICAL NEEDS. I HOPE THIS THE CEMENT GUIDES OUR CONVERSATION STORAGE REACHING THE FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE. I BEFORE I MOVE ON I WANT TO SEE IF ANY OF MY STUFF COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT TO SPEAK ON PRIORITIES AS WELL. OKAY. OKAY THEN. YES OKAY. THANK YOU AND OVER TO MISS WALDRON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS A NEW MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE- THAT'S THE HI I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY- AND THAT WE COULD INVEST MORE TIME DISCUSSING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SPACE A MENTAL HEALTH SPACE. ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALSO REGARDING HOMELESSNESS WHICH THEN LEADS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE CYCLE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- FOR MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THAT HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE WHICH IS SAVING LIVES REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES AND REDUCING COSTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS HAD SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER. S. C. D. AND OF THESE APPROXIMATELY DRUGS. INDIVIDUAL STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE AT HIGH RISK OF FATAL DRUG OVERDOSE ESPECIALLY IN THE PERIOD AFTER RELEASED FROM CUSTODY THREE TWO EIGHT. FOLD INCREASE OF DRUG RELATED DEATHS WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE FROM PRISON. SO I HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A BILL THAT I AUTHORED LAST YEAR SB SIX FIVE THREE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. CREATED A GRANT PROGRAM FOR COUNTIES FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT RELATED PROGRAMS IN. COUNTY JAILS AND FOR THOSE ON COMMUNITY SUPERVISION FROM PRISON UNDER COUNTY JURISDICTION. AND LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE V. SIX FIVE THREE CREATING THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD JUST NEEDS THE FUNDING. WITH REALIGNMENT- COUNTY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER FUNDING. AND THIS PROGRAM WILL HELP ESTABLISH THAT.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE MAY REVISION DISCUSSION OF OUR CHEN THE AGENDA IS A COMPANY BY VARIOUS AT ATTACHMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. WILL BE GOING TO DISCUSSION ON TERRIBLE PULLS FROM EACH DEPARTMENT. I WILL POSITIVE QUESTIONS REMEMBERS AFTER EACH BUDGET PROPOSAL. MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC ARE WELCOME TO MAKE COMMENTS ON ANY OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE AT THE VERY END OF ALL OF THE PRESENTATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THEIR FIRST ITEM WHICH IS THE VICTIM'S COMPENSATION BOARD. AND IT'S ITEM ONE IN THEIR MEDIA OUT REACH. EVEN. YOU SHOULD. CLICK ORTEGA'S BIG. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LINDA GLEDHILL AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD AND I'M PRESENTING ON CHIU ITEMS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION THE FIRST IS A THREE MILLION ALLOCATION FROM THE STATE RISK RESTITUTION FUND FOR MEDIA OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS TO CONNECT CRIME VICTIMS TO HARD TO REACH AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WITH PROBABLY CV SERVICE. AS YOU KNOW BE REIMBURSES ELIGIBLE CRIME VICTIMS FOR CRIME RELATED COSTS SUCH AS FUNERAL EXPENSES MEDICAL BILLS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT RELOCATION COSTS AND LOST INCOME WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING SUCH AS INSURANCE WELL OUR APPLICATION NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW DATA SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES ARE RISING EVEN FASTER THE MOST CURRENT YEAR THE NUMBER OF APPLICATION REGION RECEIVE STATEWIDE IS ONLY TWENTY THREE POINT 4% OF THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES REPORTED. THESE DECLINING NUMBERS CAUSED CONCERN THAT THE CURRENT MODEL OUTRAGE WHICH IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTY SERVICES AND IS NOT REACHING ALL CRIME VICTIMS IN ADDITION THE GROUP IN AND THEN WHICH ISN'T HADN'T ISOLATING EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING VICTIMS OF CRIME MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO REACH THEM PROBABLY CBO USES APPROPRIATION FOR STRATEGIC THREE YEAR MEDIAN AVERAGE CAMPAIGN WHICH UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND HELP BOOST AWARENESS OF PROBABLY C. B. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE COMPENSATION. AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THE SECOND REVISION ITEM IS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME APPROPRIATION FOR THE GENERAL FUND IS TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS TO ESTABLISH AN INNOVATIVE PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VICTIM SERVICES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WCBS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT VICTIMS AFTER THEY ACCESS SERVICES FOR VICTIMS NEEDING SERVICES ARE LARGE INEQUITIES IN WHAT IS A VERY VALUABLE IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. FOR INSTANCE FIFTY OF CALIFORNIANS COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE A TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER WHERE ANY CRIME VICTIM TO GET IMMEDIATELY COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE. ROAD AREAS IN PARTICULAR HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO VICTIM SERVICES AND MANY VICTIMS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TRAVEL TO WHERE THE SERVICES ARE. THIS COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS. LOCAL ENTITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO FILL THAT VOID WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS MOST PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE IN THEIR AREAS. IT WOULD REQUIRE A 20% MATCH. ANY TO DO THAT DESIRES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF CRIME WOULD BE ELIGIBLE INCLUDING NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES. CATEGORY OF FOR CONSIDER FOR AWARDS INCLUDES IS. SUCH AS IMMEDIATE NEED FOR COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD AND SHELTER. IT ALSO DIDN'T CUTE INCLUDE COMMUNITY AWARENESS INCLUDING OUTREAC COALITION BUILDING AND EXPANDING THE REACH OF THE TIME SERVICES. HOW MANY TV IS EXPERIENCED PROVIDING GRANTS AND ENSURING THEY'RE PROPERLY USED THROUGH THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER PROGRAM. WITH THESE. NEW GRANTS TELL THESE TO BE WILL PRIORITIZE PROVIDING ESSENTIAL VICTIM SERVICES. IN AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE THEM SERVICES THAT WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT IN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES. TO SOLVING COMMON PROBLEMS FACED BY VICTIMS. OUTCOMES WILL BE CLOSELY TRACKED AND ALL GRANTEES WILL BE REQUIRED REPORT REGULARLY ON HOW THEY USE IN THE GRANT MONEY. HOW MANY VICTIMS ARE BEING SERVED AND IN WHAT WAYS AND THE RESULTS. THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL ALLOW COUNTY C. B. AND THE STATE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CRIME VICTIMS GETTING HELP. ENCOURAGE NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO SERVE SUPPORT. AND REACH THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- IF YOU COULD TALK ON BOTH THE MEDIA OUT REACH AND THE INNOVATIVE CREDIT PROGRAM FOR VICTIM SERVICES. JUST COMPUTER THOUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS TO RAISE WITH THE MEDIA OUTREACH PROPOSAL- A REGARDING THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAM FOR VICTIM SERVICES- WHILE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. TO VICTIMS- CAN HAVE THE MERITS OTHERS CURRENTLY FEW DETAILS AVAILABLE ON THIS PROPOSAL AND SO ACCORDINGLY THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO. DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE GOALS OF THE PILOT- WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES THE FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT. HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITIZED ON BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDER THE PROPOSAL- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- ELIGIBLE ENTITIES COULD COMPETE FOR THESE FINDS. AN ANSWER HOW WOULD THOSE BE PRIORITIZED- AND HOW PROVIDERS WOULD DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR VICTIMES ARM AND HOW THAT FITS IN WITH THE OTHER PROGRAM THAT CAL THE CITY RUNS THE VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM. THAT HAS- SOMEWHAT STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SET AND FEDERAL LAW. I'M AND ALSO ON THE LEGISLATURE ONE UNDERSTAND HOW THE OUTCOMES OF THIS PILOT WOULD BE MEASURED THERE'S NO- EVALUATION REPORT- OR ANYTHING INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE- TO INFORM YOU FOR FUTURE DECISIONS IF THIS WERE SOMETHING. ON THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO DO I WANTED TO CONSIDER ON ON GOING BASIS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FIT INTO THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION WE THINK I'M TO HELP YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION. AND HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. HI THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT- FOR THE INNOVATIVE PILOT PROGRAM SERVICES THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU HAVE HERE. WILL ANY OF THE SPENDING ME USED TO AND HAS A CAPACITY OF X. SIXTEEN TRC'S ARE YOU ESTABLISHING YOU ONCE. THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE USED FOR THE CURRENT YEAR C. PROGRAM THAT IS ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE WHICH DEFINES FUNDING AND SO THIS WOULD BE FOR NEW INNOVATIVE GRANT PROGRAMS. SO HOW WOULD THIS DIFFER FROM THE EXISTING. THE CURRENT YEAR CITIES ARE SET IN STATUTE WITH VERY STRICT REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE SET UP AND WHAT SORT OF SERVICE THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER THIS WOULD NOT HAVE THOSE STRICT REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO ENTITIES THAT PERHAPS COULDN'T MEET THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS OF IT HERE SEE BUT ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO VETERANS. AND SO ARE YOU GONNA THE- TRACK OR- ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY ENHANCING THE SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS. WE WILL BUILD REQUIREMENTS OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INTO THE GRANT PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY VICTIMS WERE BEING SERVED AND HOW THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT MIGHT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. ALL OF OUR GRANT- CURRENT YEAR STATE RUN PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT REPORT BACK TO US AND SO WE ARE COMFORTABLE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND AGAIN BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE GRANT- AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MEASURE HOW MANY VICTIMS WERE BEING. HELPED BY THE WITH THESE FUNDS. AND WILL YOU HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE INVOLVING EXTERNAL. STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THIS. ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE A B. C. AND AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT MEETS QUARTERLY AND WE ALSO HAVE MANY OTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTIMS STAKEHOLDERS AND SO WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE- LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THESE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES DETAILS I'M AT A I UNDERSTAND. THE DESIRE TO WORK WITH OTHER C. B. O.'S OUT THERE AND ALLOWING. PROCESS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE I JUST WORRY THAT WITHOUT DETAILS IS NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. SUPPLEMENTING THEM BETTER SERVING THE VICTIMS OUT THERE ARE THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WE HAVE A MODEL THAT IS WORKING. ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE ARGUMENTS MISTER LACKING YEP. MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT- THE VICTIM IS TO XIN FUND IS HEADED TOWARDS INSOLVENCY IT'S A IT'S CERTAIN FOR SUPPORT SO WHY DOES THIS PROPOSAL USE THE VICTIMS RESTITUTION FUNDS INSTEAD OF THE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. CAN ANSWER TAKE A STEP BACK KEVIN CLARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM THE INNOVATIVE PILOT PROGRAM VICTIM SERVICES IS BUDGET AS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. RESTITUTION BROWN'S. YEAH AND I DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE OF OUR WELL I'M ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE MEDIA OUT REACH. THEY MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. THAT'S A TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT ALLIANCE WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT- AND PROVIDES NETWORK NATION ABOUT THAT. OKAY APPRECIATE THAT. WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHY YOU'RE CHOOSING TO USE RESTITUTION FUND VERSUS GENERAL FUND SO AT THIS TIME. FOR THE MEDIA OUT REACH THAT FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA. I'M I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION FOR ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THAT. THE JUST I'M- THIS LITTLE TROUBLING THAT WERE PROPOSAL WITHOUT. WITHOUT ANY BEATS US I FEEL LIKE THE QUESTION ASKED BY MISTER LACKEYS PRETTY FAIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. IF YOU. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER HEARING ON THIS SO. EVEN MORE UNSETTLING. DO ANY OF OUR PEERS HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF MY COMMENTS HERE BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. I AM I DO WANT TO GIVE L. A. O. A MOMENT TO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE CELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TRUE SO TO WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE BOB SO OUR OFFICE HAS RECENTLY RELEASED ITS INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION AND SO MY COMMENTS HERE TODAY ARE DRAWN FROM THAT PUBLICATION. ALL IN A PUBLICATION WE BUT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REALLY- REVISION ALLOCATES A FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SURPLUS THE LARGEST CATEGORIES OF SPENDING FROM THE SURPLUS ARE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES. AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY NINE BILLION OF PROPOSALS IN ORDER TO MEET THE- STATE APPROPRIATIONS LAMENTS REQUIRE ALSO KNOWN AS THE CELL REQUIREMENTS. THE TWO LARGEST CATEGORIES OF THE PROPOSALS IN THIS. AREA ARE IS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TAX REFUNDS AND THIRTEEN BILLION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. DESPITE THIS THE MAY REVISION DOES LEAVE SOME SELL REQUIREMENTS ON ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR LEAVES THREE POINT FIVE BILLION AND UNADDRESSED SELL REQUIREMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. IS CONCERNING BECAUSE IT SETS UP A FISCAL CLIFF FOR THE STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SPECIFICALLY WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE WOULD FACE AN ADDITIONAL CELL REQUIREMENT. OF OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND THE MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS REQUIREMENT AS A RESULT THE STATE WOULD VERY LIKELY FACE A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR. IN ADDITION WE NOTE THAT THERE. IS A HEIGHTENED RISK OF A RECESSION IN THE FUTURE A CERTAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS HISTORICALLY HAVE OFFERED WARNING SIGNS THAT ARE RECESSION IS ON THE HORIZON. AND MANY OF THESE INDICATORS CURRENTLY INDICATE THAT A RECESSION AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. ACCORDINGLY OUR OFFICE IS RECOMMENDING INCREASING RESERVES- AS RESERVES WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE STATE TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT PROGRAMS WHILE FACING THE CHALLENGES. SHINN'S LIMIT REQUIREMENTS. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. THANK QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU JUST A REALLY QUICKLY FOR WE WANT TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS- IF YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS MORE THAN ONE ISSUE I ASK THAT YOU SEE POTS BETWEEN EACH ISSUE SO WE CAN I HEAR FROM ALEJO THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS AND HAVE MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS IN BETWEEN EACH. ISSUE SO AS WE WANT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE FIRST ISSUE WE HAVE THERE IS A FENCE AND ALL TASK FORCE. YOU MAYBE CAN'T. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ASHLEY HARPER BUDGET OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TWO TWENTY THREE MAY REVISED BUDGET INCLUDES TWO BCPS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH AIMS TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S MANDATED RESPONSIBILITIES. IN CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS- I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND WE ALSO HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. THE PROPOSAL IS THE FINAL TASK FORCE AT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE BUDGET PROPOSED A SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION ON GOING. FOR DOJ TO ESTABLISH THE FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WITHIN THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION TO TARGET STATEWIDE FEDERAL TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL NETWORKS. THE PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF THREE REGIONAL INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL REGIONS WITH OPERATION STATEWIDE. WITH DOJ'S UNIQUE EXPERTISE STATE WIDE STATE WHAT PERSPECTIVE AND VERTICAL PROSECUTION MODEL AVAILABLE TO DRAW UPON DOJ HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMMEDIATELY IMPACT THIS PARTICULARLY SOPHISTICATED SPACE SUPPORT TWENTY FIVE ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND THE NECESSARY CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION I'M JOINED TODAY BY JOHN MARSH OUR CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN OUR ANALYSIS IT IS UNCLEAR WHY- FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT CANNOT BE PRIORITIZED BY EXISTING STATE AND REGIONAL DOJ TASK FORCE IS WORKING WITH LOCAL AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS ACTIVITY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF ADDRESSING THE FENNEL AND OPIOID CRISIS. COLLABORATION ACROSS AGENCIES SUCH AS COORDINATING WITH EXISTING AND PROPOSED DATA COLLECTION AND I REJECTED EASE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COULD INFORM A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. STATEWIDE TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET THE FINAL CRISIS AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THE PROPOSED FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY BEFORE THAT COLLABORATION TAKES PLACE. THANK YOU. BUT CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COMMENTS ON. ALLEY OATH- COMMENTARY ON THIS ITEM AND WHY YOU THINK THIS IS NECESSARY AND NOT DUPLICATIVE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAND IT OVER TO JOHN MARCIA CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO'S AVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO THE DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN THE PROPOSED FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER EXISTING EFFORTS. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO I'LL TOUCH ON THE FIRST PART ABOUT USING EXISTING RESOURCES. SO DO YOU GUYS HAVE A TASK FORCE PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT ONE TIME WE HAD FIFTY NINE- TASK FORCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE DOWN TO ABOUT SEVEN NOW- AND THEY ARE VERY- GEOGRAPHICALLY COMMUNITY BASED AND FOCUSED- SO THE DIFFERENCE IS- AND I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I. WHEN I CAME TO DOJ I WORKED FOR A STATE TASK FORCE AND IT WAS IN A LOCAL COMMUNITY ANNUAL ACCOUNTING AND THEY HAD OFFICERS FROM FROM ALL THE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. DURING THAT TIME- WE CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE DICTATED THROUGH- WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE AREA WORK. OUT WHEN WE GET- INVESTIGATIONS AND CAME ACROSS A BIG MULTI STATE INVESTIGATIONS WE'RE ABLE TO CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHO HAD SPECIALIZED TEAMS. THAT COULD THEN TAKE THAT CASE TO THE NEXT LEVEL- AND INTERCONNECTED THE STATE SO. WHEN WE HAD CASES THAT WERE BIGGER THAN OUR COUNTY LEVEL. CAPACITY WE WOULD CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND I HAD EXPERTS THAT WOULD COME OUT AND THEN TAKE THAT CASE AND WORK AT IT FROM A STATE AND- FEDERAL LEVEL. SO THAT'S- THE POINT OF WE DON'T SEE THIS AS DUPLICATIVE WE SEE THIS IS TARGETING AN ISSUE THAT IS. UP IN A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN MONITORING THE FENNEL AND OPIOID CRISIS OF ABOUT TEN YEARS NOW. A FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS AN ISSUE THAT- KIND OF EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI OPERATIVE HEARING CALIFORNIA NOW AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON. JUST SOME SEIZURES FROM LA IMPACT WAS A TASK FORCE THAT WE HAVE IN LOS ANGELES. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THEY SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN POUNDS OF FENNEL AND FREE. OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND- PILLS OFFEND- LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THEY CITIES SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POUNDS OF FENNEL AND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND HILLS- SO YOU CAN SEE CALIFORNIA IS ON THE RISE- THEN ALL THAT OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE THE LEADING KILLER. OF A- BOTH BETWEEN FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN AND FORTY FIVE. IT'S A CRISIS AND IT'S HERE. AND CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE AN ORGANIZED- FOCUSED EFFORT ON THIS. OUR GOAL IS TO WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M A JUSTICE UNDERSTANDS THAT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WE'RE JUST- ONE COMPONENT. THAT CAN HELP. TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM SO PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE. A PARTNERS LOCAL WILL BE A PARTNER- MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES WILL BE A PARTNER- AND THIS WILL BE A MORE OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH- BUT- DOJ'S COMPONENT IN THIS IS ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT. SO HOPE I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION I CAN ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER JONES SAWYER- THE GLAD YOU MENTIONED THE- THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU YOU'VE WILL HAPPEN THIS SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PUNISHMENT AND ENFORCEMENT ARM NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THE HEALTH RAMIFICATIONS OF. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE DISCONNECTED FROM THAT FROM WHAT YOU EXPLAINED OF THAT LIKE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. I KNOW HOW THAT WILL WORK AND HOW WE GET PEOPLE TO- TO THE TO THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY NEED BUT I DON'T GET THAT SENSE HERE. WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT THE TASK FORCE THIS ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE PUBLIC MORE ENFORCEMENT. THEN THEN REMEDIATION OF CAN YOU ELABORATE ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO- GET OFF OF A FAT NO OR NOT TO EVEN START WITH THAT NOW OR YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM. AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO ONE END OF IT. THE WHO'S GOING TO DO THE OTHER AND. YEAH GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS A COMPONENT OF THAT AND- SO WE ARE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION SO WILL BE HANDLING THINGS AT A STATE LEVEL WORKING WITH LOCAL COUNTIES. BUT THIS TASK FORCE ISN'T FOCUSED ON ON USERS THIS IS VIOLENCE- DISTRIBUTORS OF A PANEL AND THEN TARGETING OF THE WORST OF THE WORST. AND NOT ADDRESSING THE USERS AFFECTED ALL BUT THE DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS- OFFEND ALL WE KNOW THAT- PANELS GETTING PUSHED INTO CALIFORNIA FROM MEXICO- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT FROM D. A. SPECIFICALLY SAID ALMOST ALL OF THE FINAL COMING INTO CALIFORNIA'S FOR MEXICO- WE'RE SOURCE STATE AND A LOT OF A LOT OF IT WAS LEAVING OUR STATE AND NOW IT'S STAYING IN OUR STATE. AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME ENFORCEMENT TO CURTAIL THE I DON'T OFFEND ALL THAT'S COMING IN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A PASSED DOWN THROUGH A STATEWIDE EFFORT- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS TO THIS ISSUE. AND I KNOW MEANS AS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SAYING THAT- THE ENFORCEMENT AND THE DISMANTLING OF ORGANIZED CRIME THE SPRING FINALE TO CALIFORNIAN IN DISTRIBUTING IT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY PROBLEM THE SOLUTION. IT MAY BE TOMORROW YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE- R. C. MODEL. BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T CORPORATION BOTH BUT YOU'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T BUT YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK YOU CAN. YEAH AND I'VE FIFTY FIVE M. ACROSS THE SAYING WE CAN'T DO THAT THAT THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION. IT'S RIGHT NOW THE PROPOSAL IS THIS IF WE WERE TO BE- GIVEN THE TEAMS ARE PART OF PART OF THIS APPROACH IS WORKING WITH. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH AND EVERY EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO KIND OF COME UP WITH ANOTHER SOLUTION AND BRING TO- THE SOLUTION AS IS OUR PARTY AND STEMMING THE FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA. GOOD CAN YOU GET BACK TO THIS COMMITTEES SOME DETAIL ON THIS ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO THIS HOLISTIC. APPROACH OF COURSE. I THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER AND SOUGHT- WE DO WANT TO HEAR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO. BE WORKING WITH ACADEMIA SOCIAL SERVICES THE MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS INSTEAD OF JUST THE INVESTIGATION LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF THINGS- IT IS. IT IS THE PRIORITY TO ADDRESS AND DEAL WITH THE FENCE AND ALL- CRISIS WE HAVE HERE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE WHEN WE TALK TO CONSTITUENTS. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM. BEFORE THAT I ME FEET THERE'S CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AND SO IF YOU ARE SPEAKING TO AS REMOTELY WE ARE TRYING TO RAISE THE VOLUME HERE BUT IF YOU CAN SPEAK UP AND RAISE YOUR VOICE THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR US IN THE ROOM- AND SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM HERE THE REPARATIONS TASK FORCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ACTUALLY HARPER AND DOJ AGAIN- FOR REPARATIONS TASK FORCE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE BUDGET PROPOSES A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. TO SUPPORT THE NECESSARY EXTERNAL CONTRACTS TRAVEL AND PER DIEM COSTS FOR TASK FORCE MEMBERS PURSUANT TO AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY- SPECIFICALLY ONE POINT THREE MILLION OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCE SAYS ARE SPECIFIC TO THE EXPERTS AND CONTRACTORS. THAT THE TASK FORCE HAS IDENTIFIED TO BE NECESSARY TO FACILITATE THE MANDATED REPORTS INCLUDING ECONOMICS EXPERTS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS AND REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE REPORT ITSELF. OF THE REMAINING TWO HUNDRED K. IS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THE TRAVEL AND PER DIEM BUT TASK FORCE MEMBERS AND DOJ STOP. IN MEETINGS HAVE BEGUN PURSUANT TO THE BAD BAGLEY KEENE ACT. DEMON BROWN WITH THE PUBLIC RIGHTS DIVISION AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEES QUESTIONS AS NEEDED ON THIS PROPOSAL. I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. L. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. MEMBERS MISTER DANCER HI IT IS YOU KNOW OF. I STOOD ON THE TASK FORCE. AND- THIS IS ALL NEW. AND THE REASON WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE WE HAD UNFORESEEN- PROBLEMS. OR ISSUES OR THINGS WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD NEED- I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IS ENOUGH. ALSO THAT WE CAN COMPLETE THE TASK FORCE MISSION WHICH IS FROM A VERY SHORT TIME LINE. IN AND SO- IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT D. O. J. WHICH I THINK I MEAN I'D ONCE BEFORE DEAL J. BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN. ENCROACHED ON THEIR BUDGET QUITE A BIT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY ASKED HIM TO DO. AND SO- I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF THIS IS ENOUGH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE. BECAUSE- IT'S REALLY HARD. FOR ME OR ANYONE ELSE- SPECIALIST BRADFORD AND I TO COME BACK- TO TRY TO GET MORE FUNDING. WHEN THE REPORT IS DUE NEXT YEAR. AND SO- I THINK THE- DOJ NEEDS ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DONE NOW. AND THAT WE JUST DON'T. GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW AND HOPE THAT THE- COMPLETED WE GIVE THEM MORE THAN ENOUGH SO THAT HE CAN COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE- REPARATIONS IS RIGHT NOW. WE'RE UNDER A MICROSCOPE CALIFORNIA IS AND IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT. YOU COULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE SPEND SOME MONEY IN GAS THEY WOULD ALL HAVE ANY MONEY- RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GETS DONE RIGHT. AND SO I. I IMPLORED THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FINANCE EVERYONE TO REALLY STEP UP THE GAME. AND GIVE MORE. MORE THAN WHAT THEY MAY THINK THEY NEED- THAT WE REALLY GO THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THEY GET ENOUGH OF THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN YOU PUT INTO A THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE FOR MEETINGS. A PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING MEETINGS NOW WHENPEOPLE WORK. WE NEED TO MEET AFRICAN AMERICANS ON SATURDAY SUNDAY IN THE EVENING ATTEND CHURCH MEETINGS. THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE MOST INPUT. BUT THE SAID TO SHOW UP ON A TUESDAY. MORNING FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING. OF THE TALK ABOUT REPARATIONS IS DIFFICULT- FOR ANY WORKING FAMILY IS SO- IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE START EXPANDING WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE REPARATIONS TASK FORCE GET EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE DOJ WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT BECAUSE I- EVERY DAY WE WOULD KEEP ASKING FOR MORE AND MORE THINGS FOR THEM TO DO- THEY TRY. NOT DEEPLY PULLING PEOPLE FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER PLACES THE TO FIT FINALIZED AND GET THINGS DONE. BUT THAT'S UNFAIR THAT'S IMPAIR TO DOJ RIGHT NOW ALL FOR US TO PUT THAT IN POSITION ON. IF I MAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BUT SPEAK UP A KID WHO WOULD EVER WHISPERING. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M BEING IF I'M ABLE TO BE HEARD- THIS IS DAMON BROWN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE POINT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER JUST MENTIONED- HE'S CORRECT. IN THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED. IN THIS- A PROPOSAL ON THE MAY NEED REVISION. RELATED TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PERSONNEL COSTS. WE HAVE BEEN- EXTENDING RESOURCES INTERNALLY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TASK FORCE A WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT AND IN SOME CASES- IT IS HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE- WITH EXISTING PERSON THOUGH- THE TASK OF PREPARING THESE REPORTS. ENGAGING WITH EXPERTS AND TASK FORCE MEMBERS AND ALSO- IN- THE INTER AGENCY INTERACTIONS AND REACHING OUT TO THE COURTS- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ALL OVER THE STATE- IT HAS BEEN A HERCULEAN TASK TO GET IT DONE WITH EXISTING RESOURCES THAT REALLY- IT IS IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE ON A LONG TERM BASIS- TO CONTINUE TO PULL. OUT FROM THE OTHER WORK THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN NOT ONLY WITIN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION BUT IN OTHER AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER MENTIONED- AS THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PIECE OF THIS PROJECT CONTINUES. ABOUT MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WILL REQUIRE. AFTER HOURS- EVENTS- SATURDAY MEETINGS- WHICH AGAIN IS A STRAIN ON INTERNAL RESOURCES BASED ON OVERTIME COSTS THAT ARE NOT BUDGET OR ALLOCATED FOR AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YES THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES. INCLUDE THE COSTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING IN ORDER TO MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE TASK FORCE IN TERMS OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS- THE- THE TRAVEL THAT WILL NOW BE REQUIRED- SINCE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER EXEMPTING- IN PERSON MEETINGS HAS EXPIRED- THAT- IS MET IN THIS PROPOSAL- THERE'S ABOUT ANOTHER- ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND IN IN STAFFING AND OTHER COSTS. THAT WOULD TRULY ALLOW THE TASK FORCE TO DO THE WORK. THAT HAS BEEN TESTED YOU IN DISPATCH. THE THAT IN THE ONE POINT FIVE. IT POINT FOUR YOU REALLY WHAT ANOTHER BILLION AND A MILLION I MEAN. OKAY. THE OKAY WITH US IN IT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN TOTAL. IT WAS A BIT TOO TWO BILLION. FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND. ONE MOMENT OKAY- BILL BUT IT'S BETTER AT MATH THAN ME TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT ONE MILLION. OKAY. K. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE TRIED ANYTHING. SURE HIGH- MARC BERMAN IS THE PERMANENT FINANCE- WE JUST WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- DOJ I'D- WHAT'S PROVIDED ABOUT MILLION. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR BUDGET ACT- IMPLEMENT THE- THE RESPONSIBILITIES. OF THE P. REYES TASK FOR SO WE CERTAINLY TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY WERE ADDITIONAL NEEDS FOR THE CONTRACTS- THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BUILT IN- ARE APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ENACTMENT OF THIS UP THE STATIONS THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND- A BILL THAT INTO THAT MAYBE. A REVISION- IT BUT IN TERMS OF- THE- D. THAT PERSONNEL- THE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SUIT AND I MENTIONED- WE- WE WILL WE- RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED THE OKAY SOME RESOURCES THAT I'M NOT FOR A BI- FIRST AYE DOT STAFF TO. STAFF THIS TASK. FORCE I. THIS SOUNDS LIKE AND STILL NOT ENOUGH I I'M ALMOST POSITIVE. THE TASK FORCE OF ALMOST HAVE DEMANDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT- THE- DAY GRACIOUSLY JUST WENT ALONG WITH BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SUCCEED AND THE MISSION- BUT WE'RE NOW AT A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING THE EVEN MORE RESOURCES AND SO I THANK WHATEVER THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE SO FAR IT IS. REALLY BEEN IMPORTANT BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME MORE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS TASK. OKAY THANK YOU AYE I HOPE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE FIFTEENTH WE COULD GET TO A PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE TASK FORCE IS SUCCESSFUL AS MR JONES SAWYER SAID IT. THE REST OF THE NATION IS LOOKING AT US AS WE SET THE MODEL. OUT THERE. INTO THE WORK IS NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT- FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION THAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD ITEM TO. THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. BEFORE I MOVE ON I'M GOING TO REMIND. OUR PANELISTS WHO ARE. HERE VIRTUALLY IF THEY COULD SPEAK UP- AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION GOING ON HERE IN THE BUILDING THAT'S COMPETING WITH WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US. AND SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO GIVE YOUR ATTENTION I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU SAVE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN RAISE YOUR VOICE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US. SO WE HAVE. THREE ITEMS IN THIS SECTION SO WE WILL AGAIN POTS BETWEEN EACH ITEM ALL START WITH MISSING AN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES GRANT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM SENTIMENT DOWN SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE REQUESTS FOR GRANTS TO SUPPORT. INDIGENOUS TRIBES ADDRESSING THEIR MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TWELVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO SUPPORT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN TRIBES. IN EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY COLLECT CASE LEVEL ATA PUBLICIZING INVESTIGATE CASES INVOLVING MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. GIVE GRANTS ARE INTENDED TO FOCUS ON ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE THAT DEVELOP CULTURALLY BASED PREVENTION STRATEGIES STRENGTHENING RESPONSES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IMPROVISING COOPERATION BETWEEN VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTIONS. ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUE AND UNFORTUNATE STRUGGLES CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA TRIBES WILL SERVE AS A MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT IN REDUCING THE DISPROPORTIONATE HARM OFTEN INJURED BY THESE COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE SO WE DON'T RAISE A CONCERN WITH THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF PUTTING RESOURCES TOWARD THAT PROBLEM- HOWEVER THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE OF THIS PROPOSAL DOES RAISE SOME KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AT THE FIRST IS THE FOUR MILLION- PROPOSED FOUR MILLION OVER PER YEAR OVER THREE YEARS. RED AMOUNT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND WE ASK THAT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION WASN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR THAT AMOUNT- SECOND IS B. S. C. C. THE BEST ENTITY TO ADMINISTER THESE GRANTS. AND WE NOTE THAT DOJ HAS AN OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. AND WILD GRANT MAKING IS NOT OF COURSE DOJ'S BREAD AND BUTTER IT DOJ DOES HAVE SOME GRANT MAKING IT IS IT HAS SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH GRANT MAKING PARTICULARLY IN THAT. IN WITH RESPECT TO TRIBAL ISSUES- AND THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIVE MILLION FOR DOJ TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY ON TRIBAL LANDS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING BY STUDYING DE UM CHALLENGES RELATED TO REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. SO COULD BE SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS TO WHETHER GIVEN ITS EXISTING- AND EXPERTISE AND THIS RECENT- INVESTMENT IN BUILDING DOJ'S EXPERTISE ON THIS ISSUE. WHETHER DOJ WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE AS THAT- ENTITY TO HOST THIS ADAM GRANT PROGRAM- AND THIRD TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THIS FUNDING WE RECOMMEND THAT IT REQUIRE REPORTING ON HOW THE MONEY IS USED AND WHAT OUTCOMES ARE ULTIMATELY ACHIEVED. AT THANK YOU THIS AREA AND INTENDED AS- MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN IS A PRIORITY FOR BOTH THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WE'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THIS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS TOGETHER AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. DURING THESE TIMES OF ORDER OF PRESIDENT SURPLUS FOR INVESTING. PROPERLY AND NOT. AND NOT UNDER INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THIS DOLLAR AMOUNT AND THEN I HAVE A SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION. WHICH IS HOW ARE YOU INVOLVING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES REPRESENTATIVES AND THIS PROCESS BOTH. AND AT THAT. DECIDING WHICH DEPARTMENT THE SCHOOLS AND TO- THE GRANT PLANNING PROCESS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT MOST OF ALL TRIBES ARE AWARE OF THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. THIS ISN'T EVEN TEN SECONDS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS- IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING- THIS WAS DECIDED- AND ENCRYPTED WITHIN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR AND- DEFINITELY TO SPREAD IT OUT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE FOUND THAT. TO BE- THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION- AND IN TERMS OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE- TRIBES I WOULD- HAVE TO DEFER TO THE- FAA WOULD- INCORPORATE THOSE MEMBERS AS THEY DEVELOP THAT PROGRAM. WHAT I ACTUALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT WHATEVER THIS MONEY AND SO THAT THE WORK WILL BE HAND IN HAND WITH OUR TRAVEL LEADERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. OUT THERE SO THAT WE'RE NOT PERPETUATING A SITUATION WHEN AND WHERE. WORDS WERE WERE NOT LETTING THEM BE THE CHANGES THAT THEY NEED TO BE I THINK WE HAVE A HISTORY OF TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED AND HOW THEY NEEDED AND- NOT NECESSARILY LSTENING TO THEM SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ARE LISTENING TO THE LEADERS AS THEY ARE. BETTER ABLE TO GUIDE US AND THEIR NEEDS AND THEN THERE'S SOLUTIONS OUT THERE- AND ALSO. WHILE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH MAKES SENSE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION OF WHETHER OR NOT FOUR MILLION A YEAR IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR THE VISION THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS. TASK FOR THIS WORK. MADAM CHAIR THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH THE SEC CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT. YES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON YOUR QUESTION IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AND THE PSEC HAS ADMINISTERED- SOME TRIBAL CONNECTED GRANTS IN THE RECENT YEARS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE EXECUTIVE STEERING. COMMITTEE PROCESS THAT THE BSE THING USES FOR GRANTS SUCH AS THIS ONE. IS A REALLY GOOD FIT FOR THE EXACT REASON THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE- PUT THAT TRIBAL YOUTH. DIVERSION GRANT OUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE MEMBERS OF THAT EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE. WERE LARGELY AND MY COLLEAGUE RICARDO MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE. LARGELY IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY- FROM THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY- GRANT THAT REQUIRES SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AT THE TABLE- FROM THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY SO THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE. HOW DOES THIS WORK WOULD BE APPROACHED. CAN ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. MISTER DANCER REAL QUICK TWO ONE THANK THEM WHOEVER PUT THIS IN A BECAUSE I WAS AT THE- THE HEARING ON THE SUBJECT AND I TOLD THE- TRIBAL LEADERS THEY TO COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ASK FOR MONEY ALSO WHOEVER PT IT IN THE BUDGET- I WANT TO THANK THEM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHOEVER DID IT. AND UNTIL THE TRIED WITH ALL MY IDEAS MULTIPLE RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU. WE'LL WE'LL LET OUR- I WILL LET HER ONETRAVEL NUMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE TAKE SOME OF THAT CREDIT. HE'S BEEN WORKING OUT THERE- OKAY THEIR NUMBER QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ADAM OFFICER WELLNESS BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE REQUEST FOR PEACE OFFICER WELLNESS GRANTS THE MAY REVISION PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE OFFICER WELLNESS GRANTS TO CITIES COUNTIES- TO INCREASE ACCESS AND SERVICES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELLNESS PROGRAMS. HIS OFFICERS EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES OF STRESS RELATED ILLNESSES DEPRESSION TRAUMA SUICIDAL IDEATION ESSENTIALLY LEAD TO AN EARLIER DEATH ON AVERAGE IN COMPARISON TO THE GENERAL POPULATION THIS FUNDING WILL BE DISBURSED- YEAH DISPERSED TO COUNTIES BASED ON AN ALLOCATION SCHEDULE THAT FUNDS COUNTIES AND SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE. GROUPS AND THEN LOS ANGELES WOULD ALSO RECEIVE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THESE FUNDS BASED ON ITS SITES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED OUT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING TO DEVELOP MORE INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL WELLNESS STRATEGIES CONNECT A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON PARTNERS TO WELLNESS RESOURCES AND CREATE A NETWORK OF WELLNESS PROFESSIONALS AND THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT FOR A LONG TERM DURABLE OFFICER WELLNESS SOLUTION. THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER ADDRESSES THE UNIQUE AN IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES TO PROVIDE URGENT RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS PEACE OFFICER WELLNESS. WHICH HAVE GROWN NEED MORE DIRE IN RECENT YEARS HELP YOUR POLICE FORCE WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO POSITIVELY ENGAGE THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE AND WORK AND PROMOTE OVERALL PUBLIC SAFETY. THESE RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE QUICK RELIEF TO THE MENTAL PHYSICAL STRUGGLES THAT CALIFORNIA FRONTLINE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SPACE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING RESILIENT OFFICERS AN IMPROVING COMMUNITY TRUST AND RELATIONS. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD COULD JUST MAKE THE DELEO CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE L. A. O. WE FOUND THIS PROPOSAL TO BE PREMATURE- AND- WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT IT WOULD ULTIMATELY NOT BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO. IMPROVE OFFICER WELLNESS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IT INCLUDED A PROPOSAL FOR FIVE MILLION FOR THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE WELLNESS STRATEGIES AND HOST WHILE NETWORK- WORKSHOPS FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS. AND SO- ESSENTIALLY WE FIND IT PREMATURE TO BE- SIMULTANEOUSLY PROPOSING TO SPEND- FIFTEEN MILLION IN. FORMULA GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BEFORE- POST HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY WHAT STRATEGIES- ARE LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DOING THAT. I'M AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER- WISHES TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS OFFICER WELLNESS IN THE BUDGET YEAR IT COULD SIMPLY APPROVE THE POST JANUARY OFFICER WELLNESS PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED OR AT AN AUGMENTED LEVEL INSTEAD OF ESTABLISHING THIS NEW GRANT PROGRAM. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW OR YOU MAY NOT KNOW- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A MENTAL HEALTH FOR CDC ARE IN PRISON GUARDS- BUT A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE. A SON WHO IS A- PROBATION OFFICER IN CDCR OF COMMITTED SUICIDE AND IS PROBABLY MORE. OFFICERS THAT PRISON GUARDS THAT HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY PRISONERS. AND SO THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT I DEFINITELY BELIEVE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT. IF ANYTHING WE PROBABLY NEED TO TALK TO CDCR. THEY HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM ALREADY- THEY ALSO SHARE THE UNION WHICH IS IRONIC FIFTY P. AWAY ALSO CHAIRS YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD BE MISUSED BY THE MEMBERS. AND THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S SOME SAFEGUARDS. AT ODDS FROM STRUCTURE TO ENSURE THAT. THAT PEOPLE JUST DON'T USE IT FOR THEIR OWN GAINS AND SO DO YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT I THINK WE MAY HAVE A HEAD START IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT A MODEL THAT CDCR HAS RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR UNION. BUT MORE IMPORTANT- OF. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE QUESTION FOR- WHO'S EVER GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PSEC. IS THIS- FOR POLICE. LOCAL POLICE SHERIFF'S HIGHWAY PATROL OF ANYBODY THAT WE'RE THE BAD PROBATION OFFICERS ON HOW. WIDESPREAD DEEP DO WE GET WITH THE TRAINING. OF THIS ORDER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH THE SEC AND I WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEAL AFTER TO A BACKING UP OR CORRECT ME IF I'M NOT SAYING IT'S RIGHT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE FORMULA FOR THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS THAT IT IS DIRECTED TO FRONT NOT FRONT LINE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO THAT WOULD BE DEFINED AS- CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICERS AND- SHERIFFS WHO PROVIDE THE FRONTLINE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE OTHER ENTITIES YOU MENTION CHP AND PROBATION I THINK ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED. FOR THIS. THAT CURRICULA YES THAT'S CORRECT TO THINK UNITED. GOOD AND THEN I'M OFF ON ON HOW TO- INSURE THAT THESE THESE MONIES AREN'T WASTED AND THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE TO SAY WHICH IS A GOOD PROGRAM THE WAY WE DID THE GRANT PROGRAM DOES THAT WORK- I GUESS TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- IS THERE ANYTHING IN. THE PROPOSAL THAT LOOKED AT THAT. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER KATIE HOWARD AGAIN IN THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE- IT TALKS ABOUT A REPORTING REQUIREMENT IN PROVISION CHIU AND- IT IT STIPULATES THAT DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES THAT WISH TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING I HAVE TO AGREE TO PROVIDE DATA ON HOW THE EXPENDITURES ARE USED TO SUPPORT PEACE OFFICER PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS- AND THE BCC WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THAT DATA AND PROVIDING AN EASY WAY IN WHICH- I AGENCIES CAN REPORT TO US HOW THEY'VE USED THE FUNDING. GOOD THANK YOU AND I JUST HANDED THE GAVEL BACK TO THE CHAIR. THE L. A. U. S. B. NO I JUST WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THAT'LL THE LANGUAGE DOES REQUIRE REPORTING ON HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT BUT IT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD GET BACK BACK INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES LIKE THE ACTUAL FEET WELLNESS OF OFFICERS THERE ARE YOU KNOW PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH STATE. SUICIDE ETCETERA- SO TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO I THINK AS YOU WERE ALLUDING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT STRATEGIES ARE EFFECTIVE IT IT COULD CONSIDER BUILDING IN A MORE ROBUST REPORTING REQUIREMENT OR EVALUATION OR PUTTING MORE STRICT PARAMETERS ON WHAT THE MONEY COULD BE SPENT FOR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS QUITE. BROAD THANK YOU. I'M CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY WERE NOT GIVING THIS MONEY TO POST TO ADMINISTER THE GRANT PROGRAM SO SINCE THAT'S- THE THAT TOO WAS KIND TASKED WITH OFFICER WELLNESS. THIS ISN'T EVEN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO CLOSE. ATOMISTIC FUNDING WORK FOR A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP TRAINING AND RESOURCES WHICH WILL BE THE LONG TERM DURABLE SOLUTION. THIS IS- COMING THROUGH THE PORT OF SPAIN COMMUNITY CRRECTIONS WILL GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IT'S WITHIN THE WHEEL HOUSE OF THE COURT STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND THEY'RE GRANT PROGRAMS- AND SO AND THEY WORK FREQUENTLY WITH WITH THE VARIOUS CITIES AND FIDUCIARY SPEEDS. SINCE THIRD WITHIN SPECIFIC WITHIN THERE WILL HOUSE WORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND WITH THE CITIES. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THEIR WILL HOUSE TO DO THE- OFFICER WELLNESS. ARE YOU EMPLOYED ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S WITHIN THEIR WILL HAVE TO DO BOTH. THIS IS AN S. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH THE BSE THING WE HAVE DONE SEVERAL GRANTS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN- FOCUS- WITH CITY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY SOMETHING ON OFFICER WELLNESS BUT WE HAD GRANT PROGRAMS RELATED TO. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS- AND A FEW YEARS AGO SOME THINGS RELATED TO. OF FUNDING THAT HAD ALONG WITH IT SOME REPORTING TO THE SEC ON USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS SO- AS MISS MANDHANA SAID D. EITHER GRANTS SIMILAR TO OTHERS THAT WE DONE BUT YES IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT. TOPIC AREA AND OBVIOUSLY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER SAID ARE A REALLY CONCERNING AREA OF FOCUS ABOUT- OFFICERS AND THEIR- THE- THE WELLNESS SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED. SO I THINK GOING ON THAT WITH MISTER DANCER I ALSO ON IT I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING THE SUPPORT NEEDED I DOES HAVE CONCERNS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MOVING IN THE BEST DIRECTION FOR THESE GRANT DOLLARS AND WHY WERE NOT YOU SEEN. POST THAT HAS EXPERIENCE ON A MENTAL HEALTH OR OR HOW TO BETTER BUILD IN THE PARTNERSHIP- IN DESCRIBED. PROGRAM- AND SO. ESPECIALLY AS I AGREE WITH THE L. A. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE CLEAR OUTCOME METRICS TO ENSURE OUR DOLLARS ARE BEING USED PROPERLY. AND SO IT IT SEEMS LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. I TO SEE. TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PIECES GOING ONE POST HAS BEEN WORKING ON MEANT OFFICER WALLACE ALREADY. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU I CHAIR GARCIA THIS IS ALICE THANK YOU IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE COMMISSION ISN'T WITH US TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE SEE THESE COMPANIES PROGRAMS IS RELATIVELY COMPLIMENTARY BUT THEY HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOCUS SO I CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO POST FOCUSED. THEIR PROPOSED THEIR FIVE MILLION PROPOSAL IS REALLY ABOUT BUILDING STATEWIDE CAPACITY FOR OFFICER WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THEY PROPOSE TO DO THAT INCLUDING PARTNERING WITH SOME LOCAL ENTITIES TO HOST A VARIETY OF WORKSHOPS AS WELL AS PARTNERING WITH ACADEMIA TO CIRCULATE SOME OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES TO REVIEW THESE PROPOSALS. ARE NOT ONE AS BEING IN LOVE WITH THE OTHER BUT IT'S TWO COMPLEMENTARY EFFORTS WITH POST PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO BUILD CAPACITY AND THESE FUNDS BEING SPECIFICALLY FOR LOCAL AGENCIES FOR WELLNESS INITIATIVES. AT NOT NOT. CONVINCED LET ME SAY THIS WE NEED MONEY FOR OFFICER WELLNESS- AND SO I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE MISCONSTRUED I I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED YET THAT THIS IS THE BEST DIRECTION OF HOW TO ENSURE THESE. THESE DOLLARS ARE EFFECTIVE. AND SO IF YOU WE DO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE DOWN THIS ROUTE I THINK EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY HAVE VERY CLEAR. OUTCOME METRICS TO ENSURE WE ARE GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH AND THAT THERE'S MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY CAN BE USED FOR. AS WELL AS SO THAT WE CAN SAY THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. I DON'T WANT TO END UP IN A SITUATION LIKE WE HAVE ON HOMELESSNESS- WE'VE SPENT. MANY BILLION DOLLARS AND WE CAN'T TELL WE SEE THE PROBLEM IS ONLY GETTING WORSE. I AND STILL. WANT TO BE MINDFUL AND LESSON LEARNS AND PLAN AHEAD AND IN THE SPACE AS WELL. ANYONE OFTEN ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS OFFICER WELLNESS. THANK YOU THEN WE ARE STILL WITH THE- B. SEC AND WE HAVE NEXT THE THIRD ITEM WHICH IS MOBILE PROBATION. YES THANK YOU- SO THIS IS THE PROGRAM I REQUEST FOR MOBILE PROBATION SERVICE GRANTS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S INTENDED TO REDUCING. BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO PROBATION SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY BY ESTABLISHING MOBILE PROBATION SERVICE CENTERS AT THIS PROPOSED SOLUTION FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING TO MEET COURT ORDERED REQUIREMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE RUN HOLLISTER HAVE TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES. IS A POSITIVE APPROACH THAT SUPPORTS HI COUNTIES WITH ASSISTING COURT APPEARANCES ARE PRE TRIAL CHECK INS DOING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS- IDENTIFYING HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT AND PROVIDING OTHER SERVICES- POTENTIALLY PROVIDING. SOME REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. EXACTLY THIS GRANT FROM IS INTO TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO PURCHASE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS COMPUTERS PRINTERS- AT OUTFITTING THEIR VEHICLES WITH TELEVISIONS- AND PROVIDING MOBILE HOT SPOTS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND SOMEONE. SO THESE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW COUNTY APPLICANTS TO THE GRANT PROGRAM TO BETTER BRIDGE INDIVIDUALS SERVICES AND THE COURTS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FOR EXPERIENCING STRUGGLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULTY. MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO REMAIN CONNECTED WITH COURT OBLIGATIONS ARE COUNTY SERVICES I'M ABOUT I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS L. WE HAVE TWO MAIN CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS A LACK OF DETAILS AND SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM OR HOW. THE FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND PRIORITIZED. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE. IN A INFORMATION DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MODEL THE MOBILE PROBATION UNIT MODEL. THE RATIONALE FOR THE SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT PROPOSED OR COUNTY INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS THAT- YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAM CREATED BY SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN- IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON FELONY SUPERVISION WHO ARE SENT TO STATE PRISON. SO SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS PROGRAM IS NEEDED GIVEN THAT COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE A FUNDING SOURCE SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT THAT COULD BE USED TO IMPLEMENT- THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS- SO GIVEN THE TIMING AND THE LACK OF DETAILS PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THIS- PROPOSAL AS PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS AT WHICH POINT THE ADMINISTRATION. SHOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED AND WELL THOUGHT OUT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. HOW LONG DOES THIS PLASTER COUNTY PROGRAM. BEEN BEEN FUNCTIONING. I AM I BELIEVE IT WAS FROM TWENTY TWENTY BUT I'D HAVE TO GET THE EXACT FOR YOU I'M SORRY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT ACTUALLY DID AND START TO TAKE EFFECT. WORK UNTIL APRIL OF THIS YEAR SO IT'S ONLY BEEN. IN PRACTICE FOR. MAYBE TWO MONTHS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MONTHS. SO I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER. BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU SEE INTO A PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE REAL DATA THAT IT IS IT IS BEING. SUCCESSFUL I AND IF NOT THEN MAYBE THE ALLEY- RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WAIT FOR A YEAR SO WE HAD DATA TO BASE IT ON WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. AT OF A MORE APPROPRIATE. FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SEVERAL THEY'RE FROM FROM A FINANCE- I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN AVAILABLE BUT ESSENTIALLY THIS DOES. BY BRINGING OUT PROBATION SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY IT DOES INCREASE ACCESS AND- OVERALL REDUCES THOSE BARRIERS AND THEY CAN AND THEY ARE SHOWING THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BRING THOSE SERVICES TO THE FOLKS AND PLASTER COUNTY- AND- WE WOULD TO HAVE. IT SENT TO VERIZON AND GIVE COUNTIES THE ABILITY TO EXPAND SERVICES LIKE THAT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE REAL DATA THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS WELL INTENTIONED ESPECIALLY PRODUCING THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT- VERSUS WE THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA WITHOUT THE DATA AND SO IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT NOW LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO EXPAND THIS. PROGRAM I TO OTHER COUNTIES OUT THERE IF IT'S ONLY BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR LESS THAN TWO MONTHS. AND SO. AT WHICH WOULD. OFTENTIMES WE HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS AND PRACTICES AND ALWAYS TURN OUT TO BE THE SAME. LET'S SAY WE GET AN ANSWER- IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. THANK YOU. OKAY OKAY THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WHERE WE HAVE. THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS AND AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT- IF YOU COULD STOP BETWEEN ITEM SO THAT WE COULD HEAR FROM THE ALLEY- IN FROM THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE FIRST ONE IS OF THE POPULATION PROJECTION OR VIEW A REVIEW. INCLUDING EXISTING OPEN BED CAPACITY AND WITH CDCR IS DOING OPERATIONALLY TO ADDRESS. THE LATEST POPULATION NUMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M OUT ON THEM- CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MADELINE THE CLEAN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION TO BE DIRECTOR OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THAT POPULATION CHANGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BAY REVISION OF THE SPRING TWENTY TWENTY TWO POPULATION PROJECTIONS ANTICIPATE THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY INSTITUTION POPULATION TO BE APPROXIMATELY NINETY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OF THE PROJECTED EIGHTY P. FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND. AND THESE ADJUSTMENTS RESULTS- ARE A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND TEN THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET YEAR OVER- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS- THE PROJECTIONS INCLUDE DATA THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND INCORPORATE THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF SB FOUR EIGHTY THREE. A CURRENT ADULT INMATE POPULATION AS A MALE ELEVENTH WAS. APPROXIMATELY NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND. AFTER THAT PAROLED POPULAR WERE- THAT MAY REVISION PROJECTS ABOUT A POPULATION OF ABOUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY PAROLEES OVER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS. A CITY NEXT WEEK WOULD BE HERE IS. JURICA SANO WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF TOP MANAGEMENT. INFORMATION THE WORD GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN SHIRTLESS ON ALL AROUND THIRTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES SPORTS FOR THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE MAJOR REVISION PROPOSES UP TO THREE ADDITIONAL. PRESENCE THAT COULD CLOSE. BY 200-024-2000 TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR THIS SYSTEMS LONGER- LONG TERM PROJECTIONS WHICH INDICATE LOWER POPULATIONS ARE FOR THE FUTURE YEARS HOLDS TRUE. THE OFFICER RESEARCH CALCULATIONS ARE GENERALLY VERY ACCURATE- IN THE SHORT TERM WHICH IS USUALLY ONE TO THREE FISCAL YEARS HOWEVER LONGER TERM PROJECTIONS- ARE SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY YES NO STATUTORY INDOOR POLICY CHANGES. ARE MADE WHICH COULD AFFECT THE LEVEL OF VIEW COURSE OF THE POPULATION ADDITIONALLY THE CHAIR WE EMERGE FROM A COMPLETELY FROM KOBE IN NINETEEN BOB CAN'T DIDN'T EVEN ARE SHORT TERM POPULATION ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO A LITTLE BIT MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN PREVIOUS YEARS. AT THIS TIME CDC OR HAS NOT IDENTIFIED WHICH PRISONS- WILL WILL BE CLOSED. OF THE DEPARTMENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL- UROLOGIC CRITERIA AS DEFINED IN PENAL CODE FIVE ZERO ZERO THREE POINT SEVEN AS A BASIS FOR MAKING THAT DETERMINATION I'M TAKE MANY FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN SELECTING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS HOUSING NEEDS THAT TYPE. COST OPERATE RECENT INVESTMENTS EXCEPT HER. ONCE IDENTIFIED THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRISON CLOSURE I WILL BE CAPTURED IN THE BCG YOU. SIMILAR TO THE ONE SUBMITTED FOR. LUGER OF THE JEWISH VOCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS INTERESTED CALIFORNIA- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CURRENT PROJECTIONS INDICATE A LOWER EIGHTY P. OR AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION IN OR OUT HERE WHICH- ON IT YEAH I'M HERE TO. THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD HAVE. BUDGET I KNOW NOW THAT THE L. A. L. I'LL JUST MAKE TWO BRIEF COMMENTS- THE FIRST IS THAT WE REVIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION'S POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND ASSOCIATED BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS FOR THAT- FOR THE CURRENT AND BUDGET YEARS AS WELL AS THE LONG TERM- PROJECTIONS OF THAT POPULATIONS THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX AND WE THINK THAT THEY- APPEAR REASONABLE- AND THEN THE SECOND. COMMENT WE JUST NOTE THAT- AS THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE THAT AND- DEPARTMENT OR THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE COMMITTED TO CLOSING- THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER- THOUGH THAT IS ON HOLD PENDING LITIGATION. AND THE MAY REVISE NOTES THAT. THE STATE COULD BE ABLE TO CLOSE AN ADDITIONAL THREE UNNAMED PRESENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS. THEY SUGGEST THAT AFTER THOSE FOUR PRISONS ARE CLOSE THE STATE. COULD IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX HI- IN EXCESS OF TEN THOUSAND EMPTY BEDS. SO WE WOULD- WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT. HOW IT PLANS TO ADDRESS PRISON CAPACITY AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX AND ONWARD. I AM LET ME SHATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND TO RESPOND TO REITERATE WHAT MISTER LOZANO SAID GIVEN THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND CABBIE ADDING THAT IF WE ASSUME THERE ARE NO MAJOR POLICY CHANGES AND THAT THE PROJECTIONS REMAIN RELATIVELY UNCHANGED THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO CLOSE THE ADDITIONAL THREE BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BEYOND THE TO CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED. AND THAT MEANS THAT CDCR WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY FOR PRISON CLOSURES WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TO REITERATE THE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY AND THE DECLINING PROJECTIONS ASSUME. I GET NO CHANGES- WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE INCARCERATED POPULATION AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE MINDFUL OF OUR NEED TO KEEP CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION BELOW OUR COURT ORDER CALCULATION THRESHOLD. AND MAINTAIN FACILITIES APPROPRIATE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR KERR ST POPULATIONS NEEDS AS WELL AS FOR STAFF VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE PRISONS. THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS% COMMITTED TO RIGHT SIZING THE PRISON SYSTEM TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE. AND THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE STRIDES TO DECREASE ITS CAPACITY IT CHEAP SAVINGS AND REDUCE ITS POSITIONS AS. IT IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU. OKAY- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. AS OUR OUR POPULATION CONTINUES TO DECREASE AND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THE TO THE CREASE PAST. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I HOW ARE WE WORKING TO REDUCE COST- ALONG THE WAY BEYOND HIS CLOSING DOWN THE- TO ENSURE THE PRESENCE THAT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED YET. CERTAINLY IT AGAIN THIS IS MAGGIE WITH A CLEAN RECORD CAN YOU SPEAK UP I CAN'T WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. ALL THE DAYS THAT LITTLE BIT BETTER HALF OF MUCH BETTER. SO AS WE WORK THROUGH THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAPPEN EACH YEAR AT THE- R. D. A. I. DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS FOLKS WILL MANAGE AND LOOK AT THE BAD PLAN AND SEE WHERE CAPACITY IS OR IS NOT AND WE MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AS PART OF THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN YOUR VISION PROCESS THROUGH WHAT WE CALL THE HOUSING UNIT CONVERSIONS. OR CLOSE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION SO WE IT'S AN OPERATIONAL DECISION WE- DEPENDING ON AGAIN THE NEEDS OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION- THE INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND THEN- SPECIFIC HEALTH CARE- AND OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING. SO THOSE ARE THOSE SAVINGS ARE ARE WILL BE ENDED UP HE CAPTURED IT AGAIN AS MISTER LOZANO STATED WHEN WE DO CLOSE A FULL INSTITUTION WE SUBMIT A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO TAKE DOWN BUT THOSE COSTS ARE ONGOING AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN. STAFFING AND OTHER SAVINGS LIKE OP BUT ONLY THE OPERATING EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT. MISTERLUCKY YEAH I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT GUARANTEE THAT THE INCREASING CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING WILL NOT FUND PRISONS LIKELY TO CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AT THIS TIME THAT THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- FOR CONSIDERATION REPRESENT THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS- THAT NEED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF. THE INCARCERATED POPULATION WE HOUSING STAFF THAT WORK THERE AND SO I CAN WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE BUT AGAIN AS MISTER LOZANO STATED WHEN WE CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH PRESENTS TO CLOSE RECENT FACILITY INVESTMENTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT ASSESSMENT. OKAY. MISTER JOHN FIRE I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH A QUESTION WE KEEP GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T GET THE ANSWER PROBABLY MOST OF THE TIME. THE QUESTION IS WHEN WILL CDCR LET US KNOW WHICH FACILITIES WE CAN CLOSE. I KNOW THIS IS A- SEEM TO BE DIFFICULT BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND ANALYSIS DONE BECAUSE I THINK THE LAWSUIT THAT IS KIND OF STYMIED US FROM CLOSING DOWN IS BECAUSE PART OF THAT I THINK PART RATIONALE AS WE HAD DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC IS SAFE AND THAT WOULD THAT THE FACILITIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BEST. AT CLOSING. SO CAN WE GET AN IDEA OF WHEN YOU WILL GET BACK TO US. WITH THE LIST OF. POTENTIAL PRISON CLOSURE. I READ FOR A HA HOWEVER- THEY I THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY THAT THIS DEPARTMENT IS KIND OF PAINTING ANYWAY AS WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AND OPEN AS POSSIBLE AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING THOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STAFF TO KEEP THOSE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN WHEN DISCUSSING THIS VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC SO AGAIN AN ADDITIONAL TUNNEL STATED WHEN WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THREE POTENTIALLY THREE PRESENT THAT WE CAN CLOSE AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE PENAL CODE. AND SO WE WILL NEED TO DO THAT ASSESSMENT AND LOOK AT ALL THE FACTORS THAT HE'S HAD STATED SUCH AS- YOU KNOW HOUSING NEEDS THAT TYPE THE POPULAR BUT NEEDS OF THE POPULATION RECENT- FACILITY INVESTMENTS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO THAT'S NOT A PROCESS THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS ADDITIONALLY AS WE ALL KNOW WE ARE STILL IN LITIGATION OVER THE CLOSURE OF CCC AND I CAN. TELL YOU WHEN THAT LITIGATION WILL BE COMPLETED AND WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE ARE DEVELOPING OUR POTENTIAL- LIST OF PRISONS THAT COULD BE CLOSE SO I WILL CMMIT TO YOU I THINK THE SECRETARY HAS ALSO COMMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BEING OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND CONTINUING COMMUNICATION ON THIS VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC- BUT AS SOON AS WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN ANNOUNCE. WHICH PRINTABLE CLOSE AND WILL BE A PHASE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALL THREE BY X. DATE IT WILL BE IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE DEPARTMENT TIME TO IMPLEMENT THERE'S A LOT OF LABOR THINGS AT LOGISTICS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT SO I REALLY THIS IS KIND OF A LONG ANSWER BUT I WE ARE COMMITTED TO. AGAIN KEEPING THAT OPEN LINE. OF COMMUNICATION AND THEN TO. GET POINT SHOULD. PROJECTIONS CLOSE THREE. PRISONS BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. SO WE'LL HAVE AN ANSWER BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. NOTE SO THAT SO WE WON'T HAVE AN ANSWER BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY YOU HAVE A LOT OF- SOME PRISONS IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUT YOU WILL. LET ME KNOW BEFORE THEM. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW BEFORE THEN BECAUSE IT WILL BE PART OF THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL PROCESS WILL NEED TO SUBMIT. A REQUEST TO REDUCE RESOURCES AND THERE WILL BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE- BUT AGAIN I CAN'T COMMIT TO EXACTLY WHAT TIME WHAT THAT IS BUT IF WE- ANTICIPATE CLOSING BY THE END OF TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. WE WOULD NEED TO LET YOU KNOW AT LEAST A YEAR IN ADVANCE SO IF THAT GIVES YOU SOME. AT SOME LEVEL OF COMFORT ALL BETTER THAN BEFORE. THANK YOU. OF IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE GROUNDHOG STATE AND SO WE HAVE GOT INTO NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THERE WILL BE THREE ADDITIONAL BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND THAT AT LEAST A YEAR AHEAD OF TIME WILL NOW WITH THOSE THREE ARE AND SO I DO WANT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THE TWO. ADDITIONAL PIECES OF INFORMATION YOU'VE SHARED WITH. BUT WE ARE REALLY FRUSTRATED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE- WE WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT OUT LEAD DOLLARS YOU'RE SPENDING NOW ARE NOT GOING TO BE FOR NOT. AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE PART OF THOSE PERSONS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE. CLOSE AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE GIVEN THAT. PASSED AND GIVEN THE LACK OF INFORMATION. WHEN THE TWO THINGS I MENTIONED THERE AT THE BEGINNING THAT'S ALL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. THE WHOLE YEARACTUALLY THE WHOLE YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN HERE NOT AS THE CHAIR. SOUTH THERE- AND SO IT IS IT IS TROUBLING AS OUR DUTY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING PROTECTED AND- IMPROPERLY. USE THAT OUT THERE. AND SELL ASKS. THIS PROCESS QUICKLY MOVES BEFORE THE YEAR'S OVER I HOPE YOU GIVE US MORE THAN JUST THOSE TWO NEGATIVE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE. GIVEN US THUS FAR. I LIKE MY GOD HOW'S THEY TO COME TO AN END- AND I WOULD LIKE THIS ALSO START THINKING BEYOND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IF THESE PROJECTIONS ARE. REAL THERE THERE'S PLAN THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND AGAIN DOLLARS THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY BE INVEST IN THAT WILL BE FOR NOT COME TWENTY SIX. OUT THERE WITH SOUTH OF TROUBLING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I KEEP ADDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS INTERCHANGEABLY I APOLOGIZE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE OUT THERE. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM AND SO WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM WHICH IS OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT AUGMENTATION. WHICH AGAIN GOES BACK TO THE THING HERE WE HAVE. I CAN ASSUME AND SHARE MEMBERS- CHRISLEY'S TATTOOS ARE TERM FOR THE SONY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION. I SEE STARS REQUESTING SIXTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR CONTINUING CONSTRUCTION OF HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM OR A FIFTY PROJECTS AT ELEVEN INSTITUTIONS. CDCR HAS COMPLETED ALL PROJECTS AND FIFTEEN INSTITUTIONS EXPECTS TO COMPLETE ANOTHER SEVEN TOTAL INSTITUTIONS BY. THIRTY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. INSTITUTIONAL SEVERAL SUB PROJECTS AND OVERALL A HUNDRED AND TWENTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE SEWER PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. THIS REPRESENTS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OF SPACE TO DELIVER QUALITY MEDICAL CARE TO BE INCARCERATED POPULATION AT NEARLY EVERY INSTITUTION. HOWEVER THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT TIMELINE RISK FOR COMPLETION OF THE REMAINING WORK ALL OF WHICH IS RENOVATING EXISTING SPACE THESE RISKS ARE PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS REQUIRED FIRE LIFE SAFETY CODE UPDATES IN THE RENOVATED BUILDINGS. EACH SITUATION REQUIRES DESIGN FARMERS LOW PREVALENT THE DESIGN AND MULTI CONSTRUCTION. EACH STEP CARRIES RISK OF DELAY I WHICH CAN COMPOUND ON EACH OTHER AND EXTEND TIMELINES AND INCREASED COSTS. CDCR IS DRESSING LESSONS LEARNED IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE HIT FOR PROJECTS. NUMBER FOUR IS. THE FIRST WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE ENHANCE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS WITH GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP IDENTIFY EXPEDITIOUSLY RESOLVE MERGING ISSUES NEXT. WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY COORDINATE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FARM MARSHALL'S COMMUNICATE ISSUES AND SOLVE PROBLEMS AS THEY ARISE INMATE WORK LABOR PROGRAM IS PERFORMING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE REMAINING WORK. I DON'T WELL HAS ESTABLISHED WEEKLY PROJECTS SCHEDULED MEETINGS TO BRING ISSUES EARLIER TO THE CAMP YET. I'M LESSONS LEARNED IN HICK UP ALSO GUIDED IMPROVEMENTS BUT PLANNING AND DESIGN THE FUTURE PROJECTS. INSTRUCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE PROJECT SCOPE COST AND SCHEDULE NOW INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF EXISTING UTILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM. SEIZERT ALSO NOW INCLUDES CONTRACT LANGUAGE WITH ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING FIRMS TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FIELD VERIFICATION OF SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND DESTRUCTIVE TESTING TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE WITH AN OPERATING FACILITIES. INCLUSION CDCR RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALLS IN THE PLANNING A TRIP PROJECTS DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO AMELIORATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE POOR PLANNING. EXCEPT REMAINS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR THE DELIVERY OF QUALITY MEDICAL CARE TO THE INCARCERATED POPULATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMPLETION OF THE HECK FOR PROJECTS AND PRITCHETT SUBCOMMITTEES. THANK YOU. ORLANDO AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE HECK FIP PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED SIXTY SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR COST INCREASES AT THE TIME CDCR INDICATED THAT HE EXPECTS. WOULD NOT NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE YEARS. IN TOTAL HIP FYBER HAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 50% FROM ABOUT ONE ONE BILLION TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SOME OF THE INCREASES ARE DUE TO FACTORS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S CONTROL SUCH AS INFLATION IN THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HOWEVER THE MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF COST INCREASES EXCEED WHAT IS TYPICALLY SEEN IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. I'M AND THEN WE ALSO NOTE THAT OTHER CITIES ARE PROJECTS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES AS WELL TO THE EXTENT THAT DEPARTMENTS PROJECT AND PLANNING PRACTICES COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO THESE COSTS SIX. ESCALATIONS. THIS IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC AND HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC CONSIDERING THAT. CDCR PLANTS TO PURSUE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND FUTURE PROJECTS IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS SUCH THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING GREATER OVERSIGHT OF CDC OURS PROJECT PLANNING MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE FUTURE COST ESCALATIONS ARE MINIMIZED. THIS COULD INCLUDE REQUESTING AN AUDIT OF CTCS PROJECT PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY OPTIONS TO CORRECT THE FACTORS LEADING TO THESE COST INCREASES. THANK YOU. FOR BUBBLES WHITE IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SUPPORTS THE INCREASE OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AND THE DEPARTMENT WORK CLOSELY WITH CDC ARE TO COME TO THIS FIGURE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE COST INCREASES OF THE PROGRAM IN THE PAST AS WELL AS THE PROJECTS WITHIN THE PROGRAM THAT REMAIN ON STARTED- THE COST INCREASES ARE UNFORTUNATE. BUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE FACILITIES IS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE PLOT A COURT ORDER AND WE'RE HOPEFUL AS YOU ARE I'M SURE THAT THIS ALLOCATION WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH FUNDING. TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM. BUT FELT CAN- DOES HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR I WAS TOLD THAT THE SIXTY SEVEN MILLION WITH MAYBE ALL THEY WERE IN NEED AND WE'RE ALMOST DONE AND WE'RE BACK HERE TO DAY- ASKING FOR ANOTHER. SIXTY SEVEN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND I GUESS JUST LONG TERM CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW WERE COMING UP WITH THESE PROJECTIONS AND HOWEVER MANAGING PROJECTS SPECIALLY SENSE WE HAVE AFTER THIS PART IS THAT WE HAVE MORE. MORE UP MORE PROJECTS COMING ON BOARD TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT. ONE POINT EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS AND JUST TO DO THE MATH FOR YOU IF I FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF FALLING OF A 50% INCREASE THAT ONE POINT IN IS GOING TO TURN TO TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ALMOST AN EXTRA BILLION DOLLARS. STATE THAT YOU ARE. THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY BE UNDER ESTIMATING AND SO WHAT KIND OF SECURITY SO WHAT KIND OF ASSURANCES THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM NOW FOR PROJECTIONS AND A BETTER SYSTEM NOW FOR MANAGEMENT OF THESE PROJECTS SO THAT WE'RE NOT SHORT. ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE NEXT SET OF PROJECTS WE HAVE COMING ONLINE- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THERE HAVE BEEN LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE HICCUP- PROJECTS- PICKED UP WITH AN EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS. ENDEAVOR IN IMPROVING. THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES- ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS STATEWIDE SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT STRAINED OUR RESOURCES AND IN THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM THERE WERE. A SHORT CUTS. TAKEN IN THE PLANNING THAT TURNED OUT TO. NOT BE SHORTCUTS- A- YOU KNOW SO AS AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- WE HAVE- TAKEN STEPS TO- IMPROVE THE OUTGOING ADMINISTRATION OF THE REMAINING. WORK AND WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE THE PLANNING OF PROJECTS GOING FORWARD. BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU TOLD US LAST YEAR AND THEN YOU'RE BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR SO CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THOSE LESSONS LEARNED ARE AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WERE DONE. LEARNING LESSONS WHEN THIS HAS BEEN GOOD THIS I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR TWO YEARS BUT A HECK THAT HAS BEEN ATTENDING A PROJECT. CORRECT IT HAS BEEN IT'S BEEN IN YOUR PROJECT. AND- THE YOU KNOW WE UNDERESTIMATED THE RISKS IN DOING AT THAT LEVEL OF RENOVATION WORK THAT- WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT PICTURE PROGRAM- I CAN'T SIT HERE AND PROMISE YOU THAT THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER ASK I CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO- IDENTIFY WHAT. WE THINK IS NECESSARY- AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO A FINISHED PROGRAM AT THAT SAID- THERE ARE SEVERAL- PHASES OF WORK LEFT- PRESENTS- OUR TIMELINE RISKS AND TIMELINE WRISTS TRANSLATES TO MONEY- SO WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME WERE IN FRONT OF YOU ASKING FOR MONEY- AND WE WILL DO OUR OUR LEVEL BEST TO PROSECUTE PROGRAM AS EFFICIENTLY. AS POSSIBLE- AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE PROMISE AT THAT BUT I CAN MAKE YOUR REGARDING FUNDING FOR HECTOR. AS FAR AS PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD- IN IN FUTURE- AS I ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER- WE HAVE- ENHANCED ARE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EARLY PLANNING FOR PROJECTS SO THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUES THAT WERE OVERLOOKED AND A HICCUP SUCH AS- EVALUATION OF EXISTING UTILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS- AND- FIELD VERIFICATION OF SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND- DESTRUCTIVE TESTING. AND RENOVATION PROJECTS- IT IS OCCURRING AS PROJECTS ARE BEING PLANNED SINCE THIS ON. AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL OF BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ON ON THIS I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU THE QUESTION AGAIN- BUT IF WE CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IT'S TROUBLING WHEN I AM TOLD THIS IS THE LAST TIME WHEN I COME BACK AND I'M JUST A LOWER TRYING OUR BEST- IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FEEL. LIKE I'M DOING MY JOB THAN OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BEING. FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE HERE. THE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THATONE OUT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY WELL- WE WON'T BE HERE- AT AND SO- IT WILL BE FRUSTRATING TO SEE AT. I HOPE I HOPE I HOPE THAT WE ARE THE LEARNING AND WE ARE DOING BETTER BECAUSE THESE ARE REAL DOLLARS. I OFTENTIMES INTO THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED FOR SO MANY OTHER NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUT THERE- SOMEONE FROM A WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY THAT HAS A LOT OF NEEDS. WHETHER IT'S ON SOCIAL SERVICES THE REMEDIATION OF TOXICS COULD THIS MONEY GOOGLE. A LONG WAY OUT THERE SO IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING TO SEE THESE OCCURRENCES UP THERE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM FOR THIS DEPARTMENT WHICH IS DATA COLLECTION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE MEMBERS OF- MADELINE THE CLEANED UP THE RECTOR CTR. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU FOR DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION- PROVIDE SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO ENHANCE THE DEPARTMENT'S DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION CAPABILITIES. BY ALLOWING TO USE YOUR TO EXPLORE OPTIONS THAT LEVERAGE EXISTING DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS EFFORTS. THAT MAY ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT IN DETERMINING EFFICACY OF VARIOUS REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND POST INCARCERATION STATISTICS. ORLANDO CENTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHILE IMPROVING CITIES OUR DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION CAPABILITIES COULD HAVE MERIT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF HOW I WOULD USE THE REQUESTED RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT TYPES OF DATA WOULD BE COLLECTED OF WHICH- OR WHICH PROGRAMS WOULD BE EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS USED IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE. PRIORITIES THEY MAY WISH TO ASK CDCR TO PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES. FOR WHICH THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED. OKAY THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES. OF YES CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE EVALUATING PEARL PROGRAMS AND THE AND THE PARTS AS WELL. AND THAT IS ONE COMPONENT THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF DATA AGAIN THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS TO ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE AND BUILD UPON EXISTING DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE. THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A VARIOUS DASHBOARDS- AN OFFENDER DATA POINTS AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WILL- LOOK AT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT WE ALREADY COLLECT AND FIGURE OUT- USING BEST PRACTICES. I GET THE MOST BANG FOR A BUCK SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS- DATA ELEMENTS THAT CAN. BOLSTER PROFESSED FUTURE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS I THOUGHT WE ALSO OFTEN BEEN TOLD THAT WE DON'T PROVIDE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT- INFORMATION WE DO REQUEST FUNDING FOR CERTAIN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND SO I. THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED TO KIND OF EXPLORE OPTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN USE- EITHER CONTRACTING WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY ANOTHER DATA SOURCE COLLECTION. TO GATHER AND AGAIN ANALYZE SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE DON'T LREADY COLLECT AND FIGURE OUT AREAS WHERE WE DON'T COLLECT DATA INPUT PERHAPS INCORPORATE THAT AS WELL. IT'S LIKE IDEALLY FOR DECISION MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS- TO MAKE BETTER DECISION POINTS. CALIFORNIA ADAM FOR. I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR FIFTY. DEPARTMENT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND I HAVE. TO TWO PROPOSALS IN THIS- AND SO AGAIN IF YOU COULD PLEASE STOP IN BETWEEN TO HEAR FROM THE ALLEY OWN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE FIRST ONE IS THAT COMPLAIN OMICS AUGMENTATION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM MARIE I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. WE HAD INITIALLY REQUESTED RESOURCE SAYS TO FIND OF TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS TO MONITOR CDC OURS NEWSPATH COMPLAINT PROCESS AS PART OF THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HOWEVER WE HAVE RECEIVED HELPFUL AND BUT AND AFTER REVIEWING CDCR SPLAT. WE HAVE MODIFIED THE PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CRITICAL AREAS. FIRST WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES TO MONITOR APPROXIMATELY 25% OF STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS RECEIVED BY ALL POTENTIAL SOURCES- BY CDC ARE CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM THIS WOULD INCLUDE NOT JUST THE SIX OF TWO ONES BUT ALSO THE SIX INTO HEALTHCARE THE FOURTEENTH TWENTY FOUR AND ANY THIRD PARTY COMPLAINT. SECOND WE RESTRUCTURED THE MONITORING OF THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS TO INCLUDE ATTORNEY. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD ASKED FOR DEPUTY INSPECTORS GENERAL FOR THIS TASK HOWEVER IT SINCE CDCR SPLINT IS TO USE VERTICAL ADVOCATE IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS WE ARE TRUSTING ATTORNEY RESOURCES TO MONITOR IT THE INVESTIGATORS FROM THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND ALSO THE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS. FINALLY ADDED TO REQUEST TO MONITOR THE LOCAL ENQUIRIES THOSE GRIEVANCES THAT ARE RETURNED TO THE LOCAL PRESENT FOR A SUPERVISORY INQUIRY WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES TO MONITOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THOSE INQUIRIES. AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE OUR REQUEST FOR THESE ONGOING POSITION IS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATION TO BEGIN CONTEMPORANEA OVERSIGHT OF THE INCARCERATED PERSON GRIEVANCE PROCESS. TO IDENTIFY WEAKNESSES IN THE PROCESS AND MAKE MEANINGFUL RECOMMENDATIONS TO CDC ARE. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT IS CONDUCTING THOROUGH COMPLETE AND UNBIASED INVESTIGATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OUR MONITORING PROCESS IF ALL THAT PROCESS IS NECESSARY AND MAKE REQUESTS TO GROW AS MORE INTENSE. THANK YOU I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. A REAL QUICK ARM. RIGHT I DO AGREE YOU DO NEED ADDITIONAL BODIES AND THEIR RESOURCES ARM. DOES THIS GRANT THE- I. D. ANY- ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION POWERS OF BECAUSE THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM TO WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE OF THE AUTHORITY. TO GO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. DO YOU NEED. DO YOU NEED SOME OTHER AUTHORITY YOU KNOW YOU THAT THE BODIES. IT AT THIS TIME THIS. BOB THIS DOES NOT GRANT AS INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY HOWEVER THE STATUTE IS VERY BROAD THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS WIDE LATITUDE WHEN WE GO INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WE ARE PRIVY TO ANY BOOKS PAPERS DOCUMENTS I'M PRETTY MUCH EVERY INCH OF AN INSTITUTION IS. OPEN TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE WE HAVE A HOUSE- SEVERAL OF OUR REPORTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO WE ARE ABLE TO GET IN THERE AND WE ARE ABLE TO ASK FOR- THOSE THINGS AND WE CAN GO INTO THE PLACES WHERE ANY MAN OR WOMAN HASN'T GONE AND BE ABLE TO GET IN THERE AND ACTUALLY. LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. TO BE INTO IT YOU CAN'T INVESTIGATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS. GO IN AND LOOK AT SOMETHING AND THEN YOU WALK AWAY BUT YOU CAN'T PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATE. THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY NO WE CANNOT INVESTIGATE OR PROSECUTE WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WE CAN WRITE PUBLIC REPORTS WE CAN COME BACK TO THIS BODY AND MAKE PRESERVATION RANKING TO MAKE WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGEMENT THE CDC ARE. YES. THE DO YOU SEE THE INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE. I FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS I'VE WORKED AT THE- I. G. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND I ALSO WORKED AT CDC ARE FOR SHORT BIT- SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IN IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN. OCCASIONS IN PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS WHERE THERE WASN'T ACTIVITIES THE RELATIONSHIP AND THERE WAS SOME- AREAS WHERE PERHAPS- THE COMMUNICATION LINE WASN'T GOD- BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS TIME I DO HAVE A POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CDCR- I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO MONITORING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS THAT THEY JUST LAUNCHED. AND IF THE IF IT'S NECESSARY TO COME BACK AND ASK FOR THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE THESE ADDITIONAL- INVESTIGATIVE POWERS THEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO. I AM JUST CONCERNED THAT YOU MAY NEED IT NOW WHO- EVEN THOUGH YOU GET ALL THE BODIES. ARE YOU DOING THE STACKING UP REPORT SO HOPEFULLY AGGRESSIVELY ON- INFRACTIONS. THE. TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERNS I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN MOVE MORE AGGRESSIVELY- I AM AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE THAT CDCR WILL BE RECEPTIVE TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR REAL TIME MONITORING- IN THIS INCARCERATED PERSONS GRIEVANCE PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU ARE A VENDOR FOUND THAT. YOU USED TO HAVE- THE ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY I AND I DO HOPE THAT IF AT SOME POINT YOU FEEL THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT THIRTY TO COME BACK THAT YOU DIDN'T REACH OUT TO A FULL WEEK OF WORK. ON ON THE SIDE OF- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON ON THIS ITEM AND SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THEIR SECOND ITEM WHICH IS THE MEDICAL INSPECTION STUFF. I'M GOING TO GET EVERYTHING INSPECTOR GENERAL. INITIALLY WE HAD REQUESTED RESOURCES TO FIND EIGHTEEN POSITIONS TO ACCELERATE OUR MEDICAL INSPECTIONS OF CDCR INSTITUTIONS. THEY ARE INITIAL REQUEST FOR- IS OLDER THAN FIFTEEN POSITIONS OF A PERMANENT POSITIONS WITH LIMITED FUNDING HOWEVER AGAIN AFTER HELPFUL INPUT AND RESEARCH WE HAVE MODIFIED OUR REQUEST FOR RESOURCES SO THAT THE POSITIONS WILL BE PERMANENT AND THE FUNDING WILL BE ONGOING. BOB SO THANK YOU AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ORLANDO WITH THE L. A- WE DO NOT RAISE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND CAN RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AS NEEDED. OKAY THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. EITHER BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR. CARRYING OUR FEEDBACK FROM OUR FIRST HEARING IN WORKING WITH US ON THESE TWO PROPOSALS AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDINGLY. TO ENSURE WE HAVE IMPROVED OVERSIGHT AND EFFICIENCY AND MEDICAL INSPECTIONS MOVING FORWARD. SO I WILL MOVE ON TO THE SIXTH DEPARTMENT ARGUE JUDICIAL BRANCH. WE HAVE TWO ITEMS THERE ARE OUR FIRST ONE IS THE OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE COST INCREASES FOR COURT CONSTRUCTION. IN COURT PROJECTS FOR JUDGESHIPS OVERVIEW. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PAUL MCCORMICK DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. NAY REVISIONS THE CLOSE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO SEVERAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL FACILITY PROGRAM PROPOSALS AND REQUESTS FUNDING TO PROVIDE FACILITIES FOR TWENTY THREE JUDGESHIPS. BROADLY IT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT PROPOSALS INCLUDE COST ASSESSMENTS TO LINE CONSTRUCTION PHASE BUDGETS THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS BASED ON DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES PUBLISHED CALIFORNIA. INSTRUCTION COSTS INDEX THE THOUGHT. THE CCI IS A MAJOR CROSS TRANSFER CONSTRUCTION TRADE LABOR AND MATERIALS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CCC I INCREASED THIRTEEN POINT 4% OF A CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS INCREASED AN ADDITIONAL NINE POINT 23% BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE INDEX THE PREVIOUS COST ESTIMATES ARE UNDERSTATED THE REQUESTED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE I JUST CONSTRUCTION PHASE BUDGETS FOR SEVEN PROJECTS STATE CHESSMEN FIRST SOLELY DUE TO ECONOMIC PRESSURES WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THE PROJECT SCOPE HAVE NOT CHANGED ALSO REQUESTED- TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO LIQUIDATE INTRUM DEBT SERVICE ON TO CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WILL PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AVOIDANCE OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. REAPPROPRIATION A CONTINUING BASIS FOR THREE CAPITAL PROJECTS WHICH HAVE SLOWED TO TWO EXTENDED REVIEW PERIODS ARE ALSO REQUESTED. I COM OF CAPITAL AND FACILITY ADDRESS COURT FACILITY NEEDS FOR TWENTY THREE JUDGESHIPS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACILITY CONDITION ITS SPACE AVAILABILITY PROJECTS INCLUDE. BUILDING OUT PREVIOUSLY SHELVED CONSTRUCTION SPACE UPGRADING EXISTING COURTROOMS. RECONFIGURING SAYS WORKSPACE OR LEASING SPACE. AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- TURNING OVER TO FILL OUT FORMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A HIGH- BUT CHURCH MEMBERS THIS IS THE LOS FOUR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THE FURTHER EXPOUND UPON AND- CCCI PROPOSALS RECALL AND IT IT'S A STATE WIDE PROPOSAL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING JUST FOR COURT WE HAVE TEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING THE CCCI. OF YOU KNOW INCREASES AND- IT'S QUITE A BIT OF- JUDGE WITHIN THOSE TEN PART. AND JUST AS STAFF TO BOTH THE BOARD TO THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- OVERALL. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM IS ONE OF OUR BETTER MANAGE PROGRAMS AND IT IN EVERY CASE- WHERE THESE CCCI INCREASES ARE. AREBEING REQUESTED THEY'RE ALL HELLO WHAT WE'RE CALLING A BENCHMARKING IS THE IS THE 10% IT WOULD YOU KNOW THIS YEAR AND- TWENTY FIVE CENTS LAST YEAR SO IN EVERY CASE. THEY'RE ASKING FOR. LESS THAN WHAT WE'RE KIND OF SEEING ON AVERAGE SO WE JUST WANTED TO. THE LEAD AFTER IT AT. THE ON THE SECOND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ON ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS BUT AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM COLLEAGUES. OKAY THANK YOU THAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM HERE CARE COURT. MMHM. HEY I'M MARK MEADOWS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE NEIGHBOR VISION INCLUDES THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION ONGOING FOR THE DID JUDICIAL BRANCH TO IMPLEMENT THE CARE ACT- INCLUDING RESOURCES TO CONDUCT CARE COURT HEARINGS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR SELF HELP CENTERS CARE COURT IS THE NEW COURT PROCESS TO DELIVER COMMUNITY BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH UNTREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM OR OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS. THE COSTS IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN- SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH ESTABLISHED THE CARE COURT PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW THE CARE ACT IMPLEMENTATION SPANS VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES MAINLY THE HEALTH. HUMAN SERVICES AND THIS PROPOSAL IS ARE REALLY JUST SPECIFIC TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE RESOURCES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THE TECHNICAL TEAM UP BY THE TECHNICAL DETAIL OUT PROGRAM OUR TECHNICAL PROGRAM DETAILS OF THE CARE PROGRAM- I'M- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I NEARLY WITH THE L. A. L. SO FOR A LITTLE BIT OF BRIEF CON TAXED ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDES A TOTAL OF THREE PROPOSAL THAT TOTAL- ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS ONE OF THEM- THERE IS ALSO A FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AS TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING FOR THAT CARE COURT SUPPORTER PROGRAM- WHICH COMPLEMENTS THIS PROPOSAL- SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS AND MAY CONTINUE TO CHANGE. AND SO THIS MEANS THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL REALLY DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE INCLUDED. IN THE FINAL LEGISLATION- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS STILL WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY COSTS AND IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT. SO WITHOUT FULLY IDENTIFYING THE STATE AND LOCAL COST IT'SREALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO WAIVE THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST ALL OF ITS OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN PROVISION BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA AT THIS TIME. WE DO RAISE THAT THE QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW KEY DECISIONS AND SPECIFIC PROPHECIES- WE DID WANT TO OFFER SOME EXAMPLES- IN TERMS OF HOW THEY CAN IMPACT THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES AND WHERE THEY MIGHT BE NEEDED. AND THEY REALLY FALL INTO KIND OF FIVE KEY CATEGORIES ON THESE EXAMPLES. THE FIRST IS INTERACTIONS WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO HOW DO EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAM PROPHECIES AND CAPACITY INTERACT WITH CARE COURT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE MISDEMEANOR ICE TEAS COME OVER DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY NEED TO BE. RESTORED TO COMPETENCY DO THE CARE COURT PARTICIPANTS- IN TERMS OF THEIR NEEDS- MIMIC THOSE THAT ARE SERVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING'S SUPPORTERS- YOU KNOW HOW HOW LINES ARE THOSE. THE SECOND BUCKET IS WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE BEST SERVED BY A CARE COURT THROUGH A JUDICIAL PROCESS- THERE HAVE BEEN INVESTMENTS- RECENTLY APPROVED OR PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE NEW SERVICES TARGETED AT INDIVIDUALS. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH CAL AIMS. AND SO AS PART OF THAT IT'S ALSO HEALTHCARE COURT KIND OF EFFECTIVELY. NAVIGATE AND COORDINATE THOSE SERVICES. THE THIRD BUCKET IS WHERE WE HAVE QUESTIONS- IS SORT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT RESOURCES SO DOES THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT HOUSING TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE STATE FUNDING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOUSING WILL ACTUALLY MEET. RECORD AND IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO IDENTIFY THEM AND WHAT STEPS NEED TO OCCUR FOR EXAMPLE CONTRACTING OR TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY AVAILABLE. THE FOURTH BUCKET IS THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS SO WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION AND PROOF WILL BE NEEDED FOR A JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY- MODIFYING OR REJECTING TREATMENT PLANS OR ALSO DETERMINING WHETHER PARTICIPANTS ARE COMPLIANT OR NONCOMPLIANT. AND IN THE FINAL BUCKET OF KIND OF QUESTIONS AS DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY WHAT ARE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CARE COURT PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS THE STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING SUPPORTERS. AND LEGAL COUNSEL THAT- REPRESENTING INDIVIDUALS COUNTY GUARDIANS CONSERVATORS ETCETERA IN THE DECISION MAKING AND PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS. MOST OF THOSE- ARE JUST TO SOME KEY AREAS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD HIGHLIGHT FOR YOUR ATTENTION AS YOU CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR STYLE. THANK YOU I'M QUITE OF OUR OWN FINANCES HERE BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THE COURTS REALLY CAN ANSWER A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DO YOU EXPECT THAT SEEN WIDE RANGES OF NUMBERS AND I'M NOT SURE ANYBODY REALLY HAS THEIR HANDS ON. SURE OUR UNDERSTANDING AND- THE WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON IT IS SEVEN THOUSAND. TO TWELVE THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS- WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARE PROGRAM. IN ANY OF THESE AUDITS FOCUS. ANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE COMING INTO THE COURTS WHERE. WHERE WHERE THE COURT'S GOING TO BE EXPECTED TO SEND THEM- IT LOOKS BOB SO ALL. PART OF THE RIVER PART OF THE REQUEST BILLS AND RESOURCES FOR SELF HELP CENTERS RIGHT AND SO- AS AS PART OF THE PROGRAM AND YOU WANT ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS CAN BE REFERRED TO THE PROGRAM SO- THE EIGHT YEAR. THE YOU WE WOULD BE PROVIDING SOME RESOURCES IN THAT IN EACH COUNTY TO ALLOW FOR- SELF HELP HELP CENTERS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE CONSIDERING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARE PROGRAM SO THAT THAT I HAD A RESOURCES CERTAINLY BUILT INTO THE REQUEST OKAY EXPLAIN SELF HELP CENTERS GIVEN. THE POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DOES THAT WORK- AND- MAYBE- I CAN HAVE AYE SOMEONE FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SPEAK TO THAT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE YOU VERY-FAMILIAR WITH SELF HELP CENTERS BUT SELF HELP CENTERS. ARE PREDICATED ON ON PEOPLE REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AND BEING ABLE TO AND AS I UNDERSTAND. THIS SYSTEM THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY HEAVILY RELIANT ON. PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET. COUNCIL AND HELP SHEPHERD THEM THROUGH THIS THE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE HEADED TOWARDS POTENTIALLY. BEING CONSERVED AND OTHER CHALLENGES I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND A SELF HELP CENTER IN THIS CONTEXT. HELLO MY NAME IS FRANCINE BROWN I'M THE PRINCIPAL MANAGER AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I THINK I CAN SPEAK TO A LITTLE OF THAT I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH BECAUSE- THINGS ARE STILL BEING WORKED OUT WITH SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT SOME OF THESE PROCESSES HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY IDENTIFIED. THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ARE THE SELF HELP CENTERS WILL BE UTILIZED SINCE THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR MORE PEOPLE TO PETITION AB WORK FOR A PERSON TO BE A PART OF THIS I CAN'T QUITE MODEL THEN THERE IS- IN ORDER TO TRADITIONS THAT WE'RE USED TO IT'S VERY UNUSUAL I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WILL BE SOME GOOD AMOUNT OF FAMILY MEMBERS OR- OTHERS. WHO WOULD SEEK THE RESOURCES PRIMECAP CENTERS AND NEED SOME GUIDANCE SO WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE FORTY- THE PERSON WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE CARE COURT IT WOULD BE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHERS. WHO ARE INTERESTED INITIATING THE PROCESS. OKAY SO YOU'RE TO BE PRO. SELF HELP CENTER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING SOME LEGAL ADVICE THAN PERSON TO WHOM THIS IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING THERE MAY NOT BE REPRESENTED OR HOW DO WE- ENSURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS. ADEQUATELY BEING. CARED FOR. IT WILL BE REPRESENTED THIS WILL BE A SEPARATE PROCESSES TO BE SORTED BEFORE THEY ENTER INTO THAT INTO THAT MODEL SO BUT THEY WILL AND I WILL DEFER TO MARKHAM AND SO IS JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAN GOING TO DEVELOP OR BE ABLE TO IN THE SELF HELP CENTERS DEVELOP THE EXPERTISE TO UNDERSTAND WITH WHOM. THEY ARE. DISCUSSING SO A FAMILY MEMBER OTHER WHO IS.IS NOW. BRINGING INDIVIDUAL OR CLAIMING THAT SOME INDIVIDUAL NEEDS HELP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO. KNOW WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL. IS EVEN APPROPRIATE FOR THESE SERVICES THAT MAYBE THIS IS JUST A FAMILY MEMBER LOOKING TO. SHED RESPONSIBILITY I'VE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S NOT HOW SELF HELP CENTERS WORK. WHAT WHAT LEVEL OF COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHAT LEVEL OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE SELF HELP CENTERS THAT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD LIKELY BE AB JUST PROVIDING RESOURCES AND INFORMATION I THINK AND AGAIN THIS HASN'T WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF MODELS TEND TO WORK OFF THAT LOOK AT SOME OTHER OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SIMILAR MODELS AND THINGS GOING ON IN OTHER STATES BUT THERE'S NOTHING PRECISELY LIKE THIS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT- WHAT A SELF HELP CENTERS RENTAL COULD BE IS PROVIDING RESOURCES TEMPORARY REFERRALS POSSIBLY I'M JUST MAKING THIS. UP WOULD BE HONEST. RESEARCH WHERE. TWO OTHER SOURCE AND DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PERSON'S NEEDS WOULD BE SO WHAT WHAT ABOUT TRAINING FOR THE PEOPLE ACT THE SELF HELP CENTERS TO UNDERSTAND- SORT OF WHERE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY THE SELF HELP CENTERS THAT TYPICALLY ARE DEALING WITH FAMILY LAW AND SORT OF MINOR LEGAL ISSUES AND OTHERS ARE NOW GOING TO BE TAKING ON. THIS BREATH. AND SPECULATE ON THAT- COMPLETELY BEFORE THE DETAILS ARE WORKED OUT BUT THAT IS ONE AREA THAT WE THINK SELF HELP CENTERS IS ONE AREA THAT WE THINK WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ENTIRELY WORK OUT YEAH THIS IS MEAN HEY YEAH. AND THESE ARE FOLKS COMING IN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE- SUBJECT. OF THE- PROCEDURES IN MINES AND HOW HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK IS THIS REALLY THE EXPERTISE THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS GOING TO HAVE AND BE ABLE TO FOSTER AND SELF HELP CENTERS. THEY CERTAINLY THINK IT'S A RESOURCE AND I THINK IN IN THE SPIRIT OF YOU KNOW- AND IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM AND ALLOWING THERE TO BE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO WORK FOR I'M INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S- YOU KNOW THE REALLY THE INTENTION OF. OF THESE RESOURCES BECAUSE YOU KNOW CERTAIN THE ABSENT THESE RESOURCES MAY BE- DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO NAVIGATE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO WORK FOR AN INDIVIDUAL INTO THE PROGRAM- I'M AT. RIGHT AND MAYBE REFER IT TO- TO ADJUSTER QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW- IT SUPPORTS FOR THE ACTUAL PARTICIPANT- PART OF THE CARE PROGRAM- DOES REQUIRE YOUR THE COURTS TO APPOINT- THE TWO POINT LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE PARTICIPANT AS WELL AS A SUPPORTER. ARMED FOR THE PARTICIPANTS TO ASSIST THEM IN DECISIONS AND MAKING- BE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS AND PARTICIPATING THROUGH THE PROGRAM SO THAT. THAT DOES SUPPORTS ARE ALSO BUILT INTO THE BUDGET AS WELL AS THE- THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CARE PROGRAM BUT AT BUT- AT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THEY ACTUALLY THOSE THOSE SUPPORTS ARE ARE ACTUALLY BUILT IN. HI I HAVE EVEN MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT. SELF HELP CENTERS IN THAT CONTEXT BECAUSE IF THEY- PARTICIPANTS IS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND GETTING OTHER HELP THEY DON'T NEED THE SELF HELP CENTER. SO THE SELF HELP CENTER IS JUST THERE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR FAMILY MEMBERS TO COME COMPLAIN ABOUT AND- ASK THE COURTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. HOW IS THAT. HOW'S THAT PROCESS GOING TO BE THAT IT HOW HOW IS ANYBODY GOING TO. KNOW WHAT'S IN AT THAT POINT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF. THE INDIVIDUAL I. I'M JUST ASTONISHED AND RESETTING UP A PLACE A WHOLE SYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY CAN JUST GO COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S INCONVENIENT AND PUT ALL THIS STUFF IN IN MOTION AND IS THIS JUDICIAL COUNCIL REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SET UP HERE. AND MAYBE JUST SO- AGAIN THAT THE SELF HELP FIVE COMPONENT OF THE REQUEST IS TO WELL AS YOU HAD EXPLAINED TO ASSIST THE PUBLIC IN- PROVIDING RESOURCES TO THE PUBLIC. ON TO. REGISTER AN INDIVIDUAL OR A FAMILY MEMBER ON TO BE A PART OF THE PROGRAM AND THERE IS- UP PROCESS IN THE CARE PROGRAM WHERE THE COURTS WOULD HAVE TO. DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE IS EVEN IT IT WHETHER THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SO IT WOULDN'T ASSIST YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE- FOISTED INTO THE PROGRAM UNLESS- YOU ACTUALLY MEET CERTAIN. CRITERIA AS ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE I'M SUPPORT FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY BE A PART OF THE CARE PROGRAM. HEY I WHICH WHICH IS WHY I DON'T I THINK YOU REALLY CONFUSING. WHAT SELF HELP CENTER IS. AND HOW THAT WORKS OUT I HAVE MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WITH HOW THIS IS ROLLING OUT AND THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE EARLIER THAT. THE UNDERLYING POLICY BILL MIGHT CHANGE IT WILL CHANGE THEIR IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CHANGED AND THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS AROUND PRESUMPTIONS THAT ARE CREATED THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY. OR APPROPRIATE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS CONSERVE TO THE QUESTION ABOUT HOUSING AND RESOURCES THE QUESTION ABOUT WHERE ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE REFERRED TO AND I'M JUST SURPRISED THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS. TAKING THIS FAIRLY LIGHTLY BECAUSE IN ALL OF THIS PROCESS I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANY COURT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO REFER. AN INDIVIDUAL TO SERVICES THOSE SERVICES ARE DON'T MISS EITHER DON'T EXISTING COUNTIES ARE SEVERELY. OVER TAXED AND THERE'S A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF SUPPORT AN EXPECTATION THAT'S BEING CREATED. COMING OUT OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY GETS IMPLEMENTED AND THE END FOR THE COURTS TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THIS ON MAYBE THEY'RE HAPPY IT. THE NOTION OF RECEIVING THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY. BUT IT CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES ARE THE RESULTS WHERE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE. REFERRED AND WHAT COUNTIES ARE OR NOT ULTIMATELY GING TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THESE FOLKS AND- IF WHAT THIS IS ENDING UP BEING IS JUST A WAY OF CORRALLING. AND DETAINING FOLKS WHO ARE INCONVENIENT WHICH IS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE BEN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL WHERE THIS PROPOSAL IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE. HELPFUL AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHO ARE BEING THE SUBJECT OF ALL THESE HAVE RIGHTSAND INTO JUST ROLL OVER THAT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF OTHERS WHO WANT TO COME IN AND REPORT THAT MORE. WORK CREATE OTHER AT ANOTHER SITUATION KIND OF FORCE THEM OFF IS. I DON'T THINK GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL HERE. AND THE FACT THAT WE I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'VE ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED WHAT THE SERVICES. EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE. WHAT THE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT ALL OF THIS FRAMEWORK REALLY ENDS UP. THE ONLY PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE A LOT OF THESE FOLKS END UP IS. JAIL AND IF WE DON'T CREATE AN APPROPRIATE. BACKSTOP APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR FOLKS TO GO THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO END UP. AND THAT THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND IT'S DEBILITATING AND IT IS NOT AT ALL HELPFUL TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES IF THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE. TRYING TO TRYING TO HELP THAT SUCH THOSE FOLKS OUTSIDE I KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ONLY A PIECE OF IT. BUT I ACTUALLY SURPRISED IN THIS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S NOT PUSHING BACK QUITE A BIT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW UNDER THE EXISTING PROPOSAL. THERE'S ANY HOPE THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE PART OF THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WITHOUT SEEING EVERYTHING ELSE SO I TEND TO AGREE WITH. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HERE THAT THAT WE THROW NUMBERS AROUND. AND POTENTIALLY THROWING PEOPLE AROUND WITHOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT. COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROGRAM IS WHERE IT IT'S GOING TO BE HEADED AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP CONSISTENTLY SERVICES IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE. PEOPLE WHO ARE SWEPT UP IN INTO THIS SYSTEM SO I JUST DON'T IN THIS BUDGET I DON'T. KNOW THAT I HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THINKS THIS IS GOING TO GO. AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE HEADED SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL BUT- THERE ARE SOME MENTAL HEALTH COURTS IN IN VARIOUS COUNTIES THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERACTING WITH THESE COURTS AND THAT THOSE ARE ALL BACKED UP WITH SERVICES BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A STATEWIDE PROGRAM AND COUNTY BY COUNTY. COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE REALLY THE ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE POPULATIONS LIKE THIS AND HAVE SOME PLACE FOR THEM. TO GO. SO I JUST DON'T WERE WORKING WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS ON TRYING TO PARSE OUT THAT. THE POLICY AROUND THIS AND WE'RE TAKING ABOUT PUTTING MONEY INTO BUDGET NOW AND IMPLEMENTING PARTS OF THIS NOW COME JULY ONE. WHEN WE END THE POLICY STUFF STILL HAS A LONG LONG WAY TO GO SO I'M I'M- THAT YOU'RE JUST REALLY NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I GUESS JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS BEING NICE ABOUT THIS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY THERE'S A LOT NOT A LOT MORE PUSH BACK. BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'RE GONNA BE SET UP ULTIMATELY TO FAIL HERE WITH WITHOUT THAT THE BREADTH OF THOUGHT THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO A TO A PROGRAM OVER ALL. RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT AS A SUB COMMITTEE WE CAN EVEN REALLY DO WITH THIS AT THIS POINT. I WANT TO THANK MR STONE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. IN THIS SPACE- AND JUST ADD A COMMON ON. ON THIS- AT HOME WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING FOR A LOT OF OUR LOVED ONES OUT THERE AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR HELPING FOR SOLUTIONS OUT THERE LIKE MISTER SUN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY OFFERING A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL- AND NOT LEAVING FOLKS WITH EMPTY PROMISES OUT THERE AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT HE HAS ASKED THAT I HOPE WE DO GET ANSWERS AND- THIS PROCESS AND I DO WORRY ABOUT HOW DID YOU DISTILL BRANCH IS GOING TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM. I TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACTUAL POLICY. AND SO WANTED TO BE THOUGHTFUL SO THAT. WE ARE NOT GIVING COMMUNITY MEMBERS FALSE EXPECTATIONS DURING THIS REALLY WONDERFUL TIMES THAT THEY'RE LIVING OUT THERE. AND SO WE MUST PROCEED WITH CAUTION I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS AT THAT COMMENT ON ON THIS ITEM AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND SO JUST. WANTED TO BE REALLY MINDFUL OF. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE QUESTIONS THAT A SIX ONE HALF THE OUT BREATH. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR SEVENTH DEPARTMENT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. OUR AND OUR FIRST. ISSUE HERE IS ALEJO. SORRY NOT OF. THEY HAVE SORRY I LOST MYSELF- THE ALLEY IS GOING TO GIVE US SOME COMMENTS ON THE STATE RESEARCH PROJECT PLAN AND- YES RESPONSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M SO IN THE MAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A NUMBER OF I'M SIGNIFICANT. OVERALL AND INCREASES TO- YES THIS BUDGET THAT ARE. AND CAPABILITIES OF- YES I'M ON AN ONGOING BASIS INCLUDING STAFFING INCREASES INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE LIKE. I'M IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE JANUARY PROPOSALS ALONG THE SAME MEANS OF- ENHANCING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES WE FIND THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE ME REVISION PROPOSALS TO ENHANCE STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. AND REFLECT THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND APPROACH EFFICIENT APPROACH TO DOING SO- BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TIED TO SPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE GOALS OR OBJECTIVES- AS WE DISCUSSED IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSALS WE CONTINUE TO FIND THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN TO ENHANCE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. WOULD BE VALUABLE IN ASSESSING FUTURE PROPOSALS. I'M IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD RECOMMEND REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. AND SUBMIT THAT PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE NO LATER THAN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- WE THINK SUCH A PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE- GOALS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. THAT WOULD GUIDE OF THE OVERALL ENHANCING OF- SUCH CAPACITY. AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE EXISTING CAPACITY IS ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE. I'M IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS OR WEAKNESSES IN THE CURRENT CAPACITY. AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE LEVEL OF STAFFING NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE IDENTIFIED CAPACITY GOALS. I WE ALSO CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THAT AND THE- YES BASED BUDGET BE REVIEWED AFTER COMPLETION OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. I'M IN ORDER TO ACCESS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH ITS EXISTING RESOURCES AND MEET THE GOALS IDENTIFIED IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN WHETHER SOME OF THE RESEARCHERS SHOULD BE REALLOCATED TO HIRE PARTY USES- AND TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH A RECENT AUGMENTATIONS ALREADY PROVIDED- RECENTLY HAVE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE CAPACITY GOALS- I WOULD NOTE THAT EARLIER ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY ON THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. HI THIS COMMITTEE VOTED- CONCEPTUAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO- UP UP REQUIRE- WE ASKED TO DEVELOP- THE STRATEGIC PLAN- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON THIS ISSUE- YES SEVEN A RESPONSE. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKET OR EACH YEAR DIRECTOR OF CAL YES SO FIRST UP I APPRECIATE THE L. A. O.

WE'RE OPEN TO WORKING FOR THE L. A. O. IN YOUR STAFF ON THE PARAMETERS OF THE NEXT. I PROCESS THAT I HAVE TO CORRECT IT. MY STAFF TO WORK WITH THE L. A. O.

AFTER RECEIVING AND STANDARDS FOR ACCREDITATION FALL WITH MEDICAL BONTA METRIC DRIVEN DOUBLES AND OBJECTIVES STAND. EACH OF OUR PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON HI TO OUR CURRENT STRATEGIC PLAN. FOR EXAMPLE THE-WAREHOUSE THE PROPOSAL WILL DISCUSS IN A FEW MINUTES WHILE TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA DISASTERS SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY SHE SUPPORT. FUNCTIONS SEVEN. THAT IS ONE OF SIXTY EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. BY METRIC ITSELF AND OF COURSE OUR- OUR PARTY FINANCIAL STRUCTURE WITH REGARD TO THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSEM. L. LOOKS THE WAY THAT THE STATE AND- WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY- MANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO RECOVERS FROM ALL HAPPENED EMERGENCY AND DISASTERS. HOWEVER ALL NOTED THAT THE ONLY- IT'S RECOMMENDED THAT YOU BOB APPROVED. FUNDING FOR SOME OF OUR PROJECTS- BUT ONLY THREE YEARS. AND WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LEO'S ASSESSMENT I SUPPORTED THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATION IS THAT THIS RESTRICTION MAKES HARD TO FILL POSITIONS. EVEN HARDER TO FILL. THIS WORK IS NOT FOR EVERYONE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING IS DEMANDING. YEAH THERE ARE WOMEN AND MEN OUT THERE WHO ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND COMBAT. BUT WHEN WE TELL THEM THAT THESE CANDIDATES THAT THEIR EMPLOYMENT IS NOT PERMANENT. FOR MANY IT'S A DEAL BREAKER AND ACTUALLY IT'S A IT'S A HUGE DETAIL THAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME OVERCOMING. SO THAT'S BASICALLY ASSESSMENT AUTOMATIC RESPONSE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. HE GOT THE- LANGUAGE AT STAFF THAN TO OVER. AROUND THIS IS TO CHECK PLAN- I KNOW WHICH IS CENTERED OVER A FEW DAYS AGO- IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS ALREADY SORRY FOR MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS AGO- BUT IT'S WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SURE ARE THAT WE DO INCLUDE- SURE GOLD.

QUESTION YOU HAD IS PICKED UP FUTURE WORKING WITH US TWO WEEKS AGO WITH REGARDS TO THE PLANET AND THAT. WERE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH REGARDS TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THE PLANNER DEVELOPING THE PLAN. DOES WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. NOW THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT'S CODIFIED. I GOT YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF THAT YES WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOU AND WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EITHER PROVIDE SOMETHING OR RESPOND TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE PROVIDED ON MAY FOURTH. LOOK AT THE MY STAFF. HERE WILL BE TAKING. MEASUREMENTS MARKET CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR- WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF IS ALWAYS TOMORROW. AND WILL ALSO BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. WELL. I HAVE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND I'M SURE I'LL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN- BUT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM WAREHOUSING OPERATIONS. ALL RIGHT GREAT- SO THERE'S A PORTAL ON YOUR GENDER IS A REQUEST FOR. ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND WHAT TIME TO PROVIDE WAREHOUSE SPACE. PURCHASE NATO AND REPLACE EXPIRED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. INCREASE LIFE LINE COMMODITY SUPPLIES FOR ALL I HUNDRED BANDS AND SECURE LOGISTICS SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. SPECIFICALLY FOUR PP THE PROPOSAL REFLECTS PP STOCKPILE TARGETS. THAT ARE BASED UPON AVERAGES UP ACTUAL DEMAND RESPONSE DURING THE INITIAL PANDEMIC. RESPONSE THE WINTER TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SURGE. THE DELTA THERE HAVE SURGED AND ECONOMIC CRIME VARIANTS SEARCH. HELLO YES AS THE GERMAN THAT APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF WAREHOUSE SPACE IS NEEDED IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A MILLION SQUARE FEET IN TOTAL TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT DISASTER LOGISTICS PLANNING. ASSUMPTIONS AND ADEQUATELY SUSTAIN EXISTING CRITICAL PANDEMIC AND OTHER EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES. FOR RISK CONTINUED RESPONSE THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO FOR EARTHQUAKES. WILDFIRES FLOODS AROUND AGES. FOOD SHELTER AND WATER COMMODITIES. FUNDING INCLUDE SUSTAINING EXISTING WAREHOUSES. WITH AT LEAST BY STRATEGY UTILITIES SHIPPING. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TEMPERATE LOGISTICS SPECIALIST PERSONNEL AND MAINTENANCE COST PER FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JESSICA PETERS- WHAT THE L. A. OUT- JUST TO RECAP- TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR SINCE I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE I HEARD IT AND- SO THE PROPOSAL IS A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME- THAT WOULD SUPPORT TO- EXISTING- YES WAREHOUSES- ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S APPROXIMATELY HALF A MILLION SQUARE FEET. AND A ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A MILLION SQUARE FEET SO A ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE- WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S HIGHER THAN WHAT THE- DIRECTOR INDICATE. THAT DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IT IS NEEDED- AND THIS WOULD BE ONE TIME FUNDING AND BECAUSE THE STATE HAS ALREADY PURCHASED OUR EQUIPMENT IT IS- IN EXISTENCE- AND HAS TO BE STORED SOMEWHERE AND THESE ARE WAREHOUSES THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO. PROCURE AND SET UP USING OTHER EMERGENCY FUND SAYS THIS IS CONTINUING THOSE EFFORTS. I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO APPROVE THIS FINDING OUT WE WOULD RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL. AND SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD RECOMMEND MAKING THAT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION OF THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR REPLACING PP CONTINGENT UPON A REPORT TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION- BEFORE THE FUNDS COULD BE SPENT AND WE THINK THIS REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE DETAILS ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF THE PP STORED IN THE WAREHOUSES. THE AMOUNTS OF EXPIRED PP. AND THE RATIONALE FOR PURCHASING NEW PP ON THIS IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY STORING PP THAT IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. AND THEN NEED TO REPLACE THIS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED- JUST ARE WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS- YES THAT WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO OUR OFFICE. THAT CURRENTLY AT THESE WAREHOUSES THEY HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION PIECES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT STORED. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF THAT IS EXPIRING SOON- AND SO IT JUST RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH PP NEEDS TO BE STORED- IF WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PIECES OF IT EXPIRING EQUIPMENT. THAT IS GOING BAD IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WHEN WE'VE JUST COME OUT OF- IN A RECENT SURGES WITHIN THE PANDEMIC. HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT BY CUTTING- BUT ALL THE RESPECT IN THE LA- SUCCESS MEANT BOB WHAT'S GOING ON WAREHOUSES. BOB THIS IS A COMPLEX. IF BOB BOB BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH- FOR ALL YOUR DEMANDS BUT NOT COMMODITIES INCLUDING PP. UP ON IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY TO MEET WHATEVER ADVANCED FALL US NOW WAS VERY EFFECTIVE SPECIFICALLY WHAT USED THE L. A. WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THE EXPIRATION OF- WHAT WE CALL THE HOSPITAL GREATER SURGICAL GRADE PP. THAT IS DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY. WORK IN- OPERATOR ROOM OR BURGER YOUR GROUPS- THAT'S ONGOING ISSUE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND OF B. B. E. TO CONTINUALLY EVALUATE REPLACED MY AGE OR REVIEWS. ABOUT BP SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON ISSUE OR CHALLENGE CHU CHU- YOU KNOW. CONSTANTLY UPDATE OR UPGRADE- I CHANGE OUT EXPIRED BE BEAT BUT LET ME MAKE A NOTE THAT THIS PARTICULAR LEVY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHILE IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARILY USED AND AVAILABLE FOR HOSPITAL GREAT FOR SURGICAL GREAT CAPABILITIES THAT SEEMS HE CAN'T BE HUGE CRICKET CONDITIONS LIKE WILDFIRES- BOB ROGERS MATERIALS OR ABETS BETTER NOT. WITHIN THE SURGICAL SORT OF REQUIRED LEVEL SO. IF THIS IS AN ONGOING. THE ISSUE BY THE PART OF THE PART OF THE TEAM. HERE JUST ONE OF IT WE'RE CONSTANTLY FOOD. WILL COME ON- AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE SHELF LIVES ON THEM NOT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A STOCKPILE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS NOW THIS ISSUE OF. THIRTY DAYS AND GOING TO MAKE UP TO ASK ABOUT THE- APPROVAL PRIOR TO GETTING IT LOOKED BE SURGES WE'RE GONNA WORK WERE KICKING UP WITH WITH THE WITHOUT BE ONE TWO. YES AS WE SPEAK UP ON ON THE PANDEMIC OF WILDFIRE SEASON IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER WHAT WE GO THROUGH THESE COMMODITIES VERY RAPIDLY IF YOU REMEMBER ALL WE HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE SEVERAL MILLION- MASTER SCHOOLS JUST AS AT SCHOOL STARTED BACK UP AGAIN BOB COME AUGUST WHERE WE POTENTIALLY COULD SE. AS WITH LOOKING AT THE PROJECTIONS MAY BE ANOTHER SPIKE IN KOBE THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE KIDS. BACK TO SCHOOL THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR THIS AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET UP AND PROCURER- BOBBY B. AND OTHER COMMODITIES GET REAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO STAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE IRAN CRISIS. I THINK I L. CLOSE MIGHT SAY I DON'T WANT TO FLOAT UP AND WHERE WE WORK AT. IN MARCH. BOB- TWENTY ONE WE START THEM PANDA. BUT THE REALITY IS WE ARE. FACING GOAL SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGE RIGHT MAJORITY OF THE BECAUSE HE COMES FOR PROTECTING THEM THE- MASTIN THINGS FROM ONCE. AND WE HAVE TO BE IT'S NOT GONNA THAT. THERE ARE LAGGED BEHIND AND TRY. WITH REGARDS TO BLOGSPOT PROCUREMENT. BOB CAPABILITIES AND IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO. THIS IS THE A GLOBAL CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING UP WHERE- BOB HOPE BUT THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG IN A LOT OF THIS STUFF NOTWITHSTANDING JUST PP WE HAVE TO GET BACK LOTS OF THINGS LIKE FIREBOATS REDUCING BACKLOGS AND THINGS LIKE- BOB GOGGLES AND OTHER KINDS OF PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND- IN CERTAIN SHOPPING ITEMS SO. THIS IS THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. LASER FOCUS WITH BECAUSE TO MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMODITY- BEAR THAT WE CANNOT BE CAUGHT SHORT AND THAT WE CAN PROVIDE LIFE SUSTAINING LIFE LINE. OF RESOURCES WHAT WE NEED. I THANK YOU I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE THE SAME. GOALS HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LEARN FROM. WHERE WE'RE AT A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AM AND WE READ IT BETTER PREPARED. MOVING FORWARD WHETHER IT'S ON CLIMATE OR ANY OTHER. EMERGENCY THAT IS OUT THERE I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE ALLEY- IS STILL SEEN OUR FAIR THOUGH AS WE STILL NEED TO ENSURE. TAXPAYERS THAT WE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE WITH. THEIR DOLLARS OUT THERE AND SO I DO THINK SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR AND ANSWERS FOR THEM WOULD BE. APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE VOTERS THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM TWENTY TWENTY. AND PLANNING BETTER BUT WE'RE ALSO BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE- UP THERE AS WELL AND SO I DO HOPE. HE GETS SOME ANSWERS TO THE- QUESTIONS. HERE ARE AND THAT. WE AT THE END THE DAY WE HAVE. A BUDGET THAT WE'RE VOTING ON THAT THERE AND SO I DO AS THIS PROCESS CONTINUES- I LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS ON ON THIS ITEM. ON THE WAY HOUSING ITEM. AT THE ONLY OTHER ITEM THE ONLY OTHER PIECE I WANT TO ADD TO THIS I KNOW THAT THIS IS A ONE TIME. ALLOCATION. AND IT JUST WONDERING IF WE SHOULD BE PLENTY MORE LONG TERM. I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST KIND OF ANY NON RANDOMLY. ALONG THE WAY AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF. THE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO COMMENT ON. AND THAT WAY I REALLY DO YOU KNOW ONE YEAR VERSUS SOMETHING pTHANKS JERRY I WOULD LIKE TO COME ON THAT SO. WE'RE ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A LONGER TRM STRATEGY FOR PER MINUTE- BOB. WAREHOUSING A BEACH TO FACILITIES NORTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN ORDER OBVIOUSLY LIKE ALL OF US- STILL IN THE THROES OF RESPONDING TO THE DISASTERS AND- AND THE PANDEMIC SPECIFICALLY- THAT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER BOB YOU KNOW- A COMPREHENSIVE AND STOP ALL. PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ON ALL OF THAT IS IT ROCKPORT YOU BOB THIS IS A HI INTRINSICALLY CHEN. AND OUT WILL WELCOME BACKGROUND THIS NEXT GO AROUND WITHOUT THE MORE. COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. AND AT UNTIL THEY YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE YOU ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING MORE LONG TERM- WHAT WITH THE TEN MAINLY SAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR ON THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT APPROXIMATELY WHAT ARE. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING IF YOU'RE GOING TO NEED. 2% SOMETHING TO US. IS IT UP. MEXICANUM CHAIR- WEEKS MARKET CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR- OF THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU WOULD PROVIDE US FUNDING THROUGH JAN THIRTY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT'S ONE YEAR FUNDING SO WE WOULD BE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTING APPROVAL OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM PROPOSAL PRIOR TO THAT TIME SO IN DEVELOPMENT AT THAT. OF THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET NOT TWENTY THREE TWENTY PARK BUDGET. SB BY THE NECK BUDGET S. BEFORE THE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE SHOULD HAVE. AND A PLAN BRETT. MADAM CHAIR MITCH MEDICAMENTS I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT THE ONLY OTHER BOOK REALLY IT ADDRESS THAT WE HAVE ONE MILLION SQUARE FEET IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- OUR GOAL IS STILL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET THERE OR AT LEAST UNTIL DECEMBER AT WHICH POINT IN TIME WE'RE GOING TO BE TRANSITIONING OR REDUCING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OBLIGATION THERE TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SCORPION WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES UNINSURED AT THAT HAPPENS BUT THE ARTICLE IS STILL NOT ONE POINT FIVE. ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT RATHER. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. WAREHOUSE OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER JONES SAWYER. BUT I COULDN'T RESIST- AT THE FORMER MERGING PREPAREDNESS COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND I WAS IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS- I BOTTOM UP GAME GO SANDBAGS BACK WHEN WE USED TO HAVE FLOOD- IT'S PROBABLY EIGHTY NINE. BILLS THEIR BAG TO PROBABLY MOLD IT IN ARRIVE IT RIGHT NOW. AND FEMA WOULD NOT A REPEAT WOULD NOT LET US BY THINGS LIKE CHAIRS AND TABLES AND TENTS. AND THEY WOULD ONLY REIMBURSE US FOR THINGS THAT WE LEAST I STILL THINK WITH THE STUPID IDEA BUT- THAT WAS THE WAY THE WITH THAT THINGS. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ONE WE DON'T GO AHEAD AND BUY THINGS THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT REIMBURSE US FOR. TO THAT WE DON'T WE ACTUALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THINGS ARE ARE PERISHABLE BECAUSE THAT IS A REAL CONCERN THAT WE PUT ALL THE STUFF IN A WAREHOUSE IN A COME TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE- WE GET THROUGH THIS AND YOU HAVE THESE MASKING THEIR- FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. EVERY TWO YEARS WITH. ROTATING THEM OUT. OF LIKE WE COULD HAVE BEEN DOING WITH THOSE SANDBAGS. CIVILISED COULD STILL BE BUYING FED BAGS RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT. SO I TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT WASTING MONEY. ON THINGS THAT- YES RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE IN A FLOOD SITUATION WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THAT WAY AND WE HAVE TO BE THAT SOMEONE SAID. MINDFUL OF- SOMEONE'S MONEY DAVID IS AS IT IS YOUR MONEY WOULD YOU CONTINUE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN'T USE EVERY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO I'M JUST PUTTING THAT OUT THERE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REPRESENTED THAT THE OPERATION AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT BOB I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE FOR EVERYONE IS THAT. THE PROBLEM. IS THE MASTER OF THE GORBALS ECCENTRIC BEACH ARE UTILIZED FOR NOT JUST THE PANDEMIC BUT FOR ALL HAZARDS RIGHT WE DEPLOYED BURKE WILDFIRE SMOKE- WHICH WE KNOW WE HAVE SEEN COME INTO. URBAN AREAS AND THAT YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE CITY SAN FRANCISCO WAS ALMOST DEVELOPMENT WITH SMOKE AND SO WE'VE WE'VE USED IT AT SCHOOL FIVE SECONDS RIGHT WE'VE- PUSHED THEM OUT THAT BUSINESS EDITION OTHER TOP ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE OUR ECONOMY COULD STILL BE MOVING RIGHT. SO WE TRY TO LEVERAGES BUDGET THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO MEET ALL OF THAT THE RISKS AND THREATS BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A PERISHABLE ITEM WE'RE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS LIKE JUST SIXTEEN. A DISS THERE CONSTANTLY ROTATING AND ACCESSING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE UPDATED- COMMODITIES BUT ALL THE BATTERIES ARE CHARGED NOT BAD THAT GENERATORS ARE FUELED AND THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW A QUICK A QUICK MINUTES READY TO GO. AND THAT'S A CRITICAL FUNCTION JOHNSON PARTICULARLY IN A STATE LIKE THIS BOB HERTZBERG WE SEE ON ANOTHER EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS THAT WERE ROTATED A LOT OF THINGS THE ANNUALLY- BUT- AND WE DO ALSO WORK TO GET. AS MUCH FEMA REIMBURSEMENT ALL IT'S CERTAINLY ALL THE STAFF FOR THE PANDEMIC CURRENTLY IT'S STILL AT A HUNDRED PERCENT- WEEK FIRST MET BY FEMA HANNAH BETH TOOK IT WILL CHANGE OUR DOG TO AT NINETY TEN SHORT FORMAT UNTIL THE EMERGENCY IS OVER AND THEN IT'LL BE A DIFFERENT STORY SO. PART OF THIS PROPERTY WE'RE DOING NOW IS REALLY EACH BUILDING THAT SUSTAINABLE THIS- YOU KNOW WE DON'T ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL. DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF THAT WILL COME TO RIGHT NOW BUT THAT THE NEEDS AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR US TO. EXPORT THE SIXTY CALIFORNIA'S. AFTERWORLD WILL REMAIN. I JUST DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE- OF. THE TERM NEED- MADAM SHE THAT YOU WOULD ASK I THIS IS A ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF AYE. THAT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE INTO THIS STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND I'M A RATHER THAN DOING THINGS IN A PEACEFUL MEAL FASHION. ON IF THE DEPARTMENT WERE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR STORING PP IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN A YEAR LATER DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT MAYBE LAYS OUT A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE- OR DIFFERENT COLOR CAPACITY GOALS IDENTIFIES DIFFERENT TYPES OF THREATS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO. ON THAT THAT MIGHT NOT ALIGN WITH WHAT THEY COME UP WITH AND SO- WE I THINK WE WOULD CAUTION AGAINST. DOING THINGS IN A PIECEMEAL PLAN- AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE SORT OF AN INTERIM NEED AS THE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN PROCURED AND THE STATE DOES HAVE A NEED TO DISPERSE THIS EQUIPMENT-BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN AND- AND REALLY JUST THE SITUATION KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS. THE NEED FOR A PLAN ON ONGOING BASIS AS- THAT THE PROCUREMENT OF THE WAREHOUSES IN THE PP WAS DONE IN A VERY REACTIONARY FASHION WHEN. THE CALL THE PANDEMIC STARTED AS OPPOSED TO HAVING A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH ON THE FRONTEND. THANK THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ITEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE THIRD. ITEM WHICH IS CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE. RIGHT THANKS I'M NOT SURE SO THE FINAL REQUEST ON THE AGENDA IS- SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND THAT'S FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BOND GOING IN TWENTY THREE POSITIONS BONTA ECHO FIVE UPDATE THE NUMBER OF KEY COURSES FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND A BIRD AND SHE RESPONDED REYES THE. CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE. RESEND COURT. WALL BOB BLACK THE NEW NORMAL THAT WE'RE ALL FACING AND WILL ENSURE THE STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS PRIVATE. SECTOR NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVE IN DISASTERS WILL BE FULLY TRAINED TO BE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL ALLOW CSC ACT PROVIDE NEW EXISTING AND UPDATED CERTIFICATE AND CREDENTIALS OR SENSE AND EXERCISE SUPPORT IN MORE LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN BOTH YOUR PERSONAL AND VIRTUAL INSTRUCTIONAL INSTRUCTOR LED FORMATS. HI THIS IS A PROBLEM IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS UP SUPPORTING STATEWIDE TRAINING EXERCISE EDUCATION AND URGENCY MANAGEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY ALL RIGHT SECURITY OUT OF MATERIALS DISASTER RECOVERY AND CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS FROM LOCAL STATE AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS BURKE SHE MET IN PERSONNEL PRIVATE SECTOR CUSTOMERS. AND FOR REGIONAL MUTILATE STABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS LIKE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MUTUAL AID PROGRAM- INSURERS THAT WERE POORLY TRAINED AND CAPABLE OF MUTUAL AID. COORDINATOR AT THE RETAIL LEVEL- SO. THAT'S AND THAT'S THAT'S THE- THE- AS PART OF THIS PARTICULAR- REQUEST AGAIN- THIS IS BASED UPON THE- CONTINUAL APPLICATION YEAH- NEED TO MEET THE EVER CHANGING. ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FACE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AREN'T RESELLING IT AS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM ALL OF THE ASYMMETRICAL CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. HELLO AT JUST COMPUTERS THE WITH THE L. A. L. A. CAN AND SO WE WOULD DO IT WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL REALLY LACKS SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AND I'M HAVING A BROAD BASED INCREASE IN TRAINING- WHAT TRAINING IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE- AGAIN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WOULD BE BEST INFORMED BY AFTER THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN- AND SO- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE MOST OF THE REQUEST- HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT SET THE SEVEN POSITIONS FOR VIRTUAL TRAINING. ON COULD BE REASONABLE ESPECIALLY ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS THEY COULD BE REVISITED AFTER TO THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPS A STRATEGIC PLAN- BUT THOSE POSITIONS WOULD ALLOW- WE ASKED TO HAVE SUNG SOME AUGMENTATION OF ITS TRAINING CAPACITY AND THE VIRTUAL FORMAT WOULD OPEN THE TRAINING UP TO ANYBODY IN THE STATE INCLUDING MORE RURAL REMOTE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE TRAINING INSTITUTE- AND THEN THESE BROADER INCREASES OF THE TRAINING INSTITUTES CAPACITY AND ROLE IN THE STATE COULD BE SOMETHING THAT ARE CONSIDERED AS PART OF ITS DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. BUT THANK YOU CAN THE DEPARTMENT LET US KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT. FUNDING LEVEL A NUMBER OF POSITIONS. YOU HAVE FOR THIS TRAINING METHOD TO. I AM I STOP LOOKING THAT UP RIGHT NOW- FOR YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT CHAIR. BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A MAP CAN I JUST SAY THAT- WITH THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION.

INVOLVED ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE MEMBERS DEBATE RETRAINING TO PRIVATE. SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS INSURERS. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE ACROSS THE STATE AND IT HERE'S TO BY THE MURDERS MAN SYSTEM THE METRIX'S WITH THAT MEETS THE OBJECTIVES IN METRICS THAT ARE SUPPORT IN OUR CREDIT DECISION. THAT MEETS THE INTO THE COMMANDS- THAT SYSTEM STRUCTURE THE CALIFORNIA USES DURING EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS ALL TRAINING PREPARED AND LIBERTYTHESE ENTITIES ARE PAID FOR BY THE REQUESTED PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATION. AS THE CHAPTERS ARE BECOME LARGER MORE FREQUENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES ARE RELYING MORE NGOS AND VOLUNTEER GROUPS SUPPORT RESPONSE RECOVERY EFFORTS PROVIDE TRAINING. PROGRAM. TRADING TO THESE GROUPS WITH WITH THE STATE RESPONSE SINCE. ALL RIGHT WHICH THAT THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY HERE AS POLLS BY THE L. A. O. WITH TO THE WAY. THAT WE BOB FOR RESPOND TO I JUST ASK I WISH WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE DISASTER IS GOING TO BRING IN FRONT OF US BUT THE TRUTH OUT OF RACES THAT'S NOT HOW REALITY WORKS AND THE FACT IS THAT- WE HAVE A STRATEGIC PLANS I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR- THE COMPASS THE L. A. L. WHICH THAT HELD STRATEGIC PLAN EXISTS. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN TO FOLLOW IT TO A T. IT BUILDS THE CAPABILITY CAPACITY WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS EVERYTHING ACTUALLY ACROSS IT FOR MULTIPLE YEARS OUT WE JUST WENT TO ANOTHER CREDIT THEY SHOULD THIS PAST WEEK.

YOUR CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY AND THAT THAT IT CANNOT YEAH A SUCCESSFUL EFFICIENT WAY SO- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I EDITORIAL LIKE THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT THE- FOR THE RECORD I THAT THE COMICS THE L. A. L. THAT- IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY DIDN'T TAKE ANY STRATEGIC PLAN THAT THAT WHERE **** NILLY JUST BEING INCORRECT. AND- YES. RESOURCE FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER AND NO NO. OR THERE IS A- MISTER TO THIS IN AND WE HAVE SO- BOB EFFECTIVELY AND OF THEM ARE IN THE PAST YEARS AND THE ANSWER OF THE- IT A BOB LEVIN POINT FOR.

I'M SO. I APPRECIATE THAT THE TIME IT TOOK TO ENTER TO LIFE YOUR THOUGHTS HERE TO US- I THINK IT'S OUR JOB TO ASK QUESTIONS AT THE L. A. ILL STOP TO ASK QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING FISCALLY PRUDENT WITH OUR DOLLARS- AND IT'S AS OUR PARTNERS I THINK. A BETTER WAY TO APPROACH IS THIS IS NOT TO. BAKAN SENDING TO US- AND IN THIS MOMENT- AND- AS THE AS THE WOMEN I GET MANSPLAINING TO QUITE. TOO OFTEN- AND IN THIS PLACE A LITTLE TOO OFTEN OUT THERE AND SO I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS ON THE DAYS BUT I DO FEEL LIKE I WAS JUST MANSPLAINING TO. AND MY QUESTION WAS NOT ANSWERED AND I HAD A SECOND QUESTION THAT I WANTED TO ADD TO THIS- INSIGHT WOULD ASK THAT WE ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANY EDITORIALIZING- OF WITH THE L. A. L. SAT OR WHAT MY QUESTION IS AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER YOU COULD TELL ME WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER WE'LL GET IT TO YOU. LATER AND SO THE EARLIER QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS FOR THIS TRAINING INSTITUTE MY SECOND QUESTION IS THAT THE PRIMARY RESOURCE FOR TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL OR THE LOCAL FIVE OTHER. TRAINING OUT THERE THAT THE THAT THEY'RE USING THEIR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEY ADEQUATE. OR NOT. I'M SURE. YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST QUESTION IS- ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION FIVE DOLLARS AND FORTY EIGHT AUTHORIZED POSITION FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE- WE ACTUALLY THE SECOND QUESTION IS- THAT- THIS IS THE- PRIMARY- MARKET SHE MANAGEMENT TRAINING CENTER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BOB THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE IS- OTHER TRAINING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN. ACQUIRE BIG CAN'T GO- FOR EXAMPLE LIKE TEXAS A AND M. AND SOME OF THE OUT OF STATE- TRAINING CONSORTIUMS THAT ARE PART OF THE- DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAQQAQ OUTWARDS- CAN PROVIDE TRADING AS WELL AS- BOB MAPLE POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL. IN MONTEREY BOB HERTZBERG D. C. MANAGEMENT CONSTRUCT AND NOT ALL HAZARDS STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS OUTLINED STATURE IT- CSPI IS THE PRIMARY STOCK.

WE WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL I'M CALLING THIS THAT THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCIES HAPPEN GROWING- WHETHER IT'S ON WILDFIRES AND THAT SEASON AS LONG LONGER JUST THREE MONTHS BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT'S YEAR ROUND. I AM EACH YEAR- WE ARE SETTING NEW RECORDS AND SO PLANNING FOR THOSE RECORDS MAKES IT HARD I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN OUR DATA POINTS KEEP CHANGING THOSE PROJECTIONS ALSO CHANGE. ALONG THE WAY AND SO WE TRY TO BE FAIR IN IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT- I THINK THAT ASKING THESE QUESTIONS ARE IMPORTANT. AND ANSWERING SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT SO THAT GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE HAVE WE CAN BE CONFIDENT AT THAT AT THIS POINT. WITH THE REALITY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST pAND BE FLEXIBLE AS SEVERAL CONTINUES TO CHANGE OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S ON WILDFIRES- HE EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. EARTHQUAKES THAT WERE ALL EXPECTING AT SOME POINT ARE OR THE MANY OTHER MANY- EMERGENCIES THAT YOUR OFFER THAT YOUR OFFICE- WORKS WITH ON- AND RESPONSE TO ON A REGULAR BASIS OUT THERE AND SO I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WORK THAT YOU DO. I DO ALL THE KNOWLEDGE IS BECOME MORE MORE COMPLEX OVER THE YEARS- I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION. AND ANSWER EACH OTHER'S QUESTIONS THAT WE AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVE A FOR A PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE ALL WE CAN ALL BE CONFIDENT ED. I'M GONNA ASK THE L. A. O. TO ADD ANY. ARE THAT THEY WANT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I DID WANT TO JUST CLARIFY- IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A MISCOMMUNICATION THIS STRATEGIC PLAN THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS.

AND THEN LASTLY WE JUST WANT TO- WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE A FULL REPEAL OF CIVIL ASSESSMENTS IN TRIAL IN TRAFFIC COURTS.
