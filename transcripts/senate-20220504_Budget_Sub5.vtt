00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:47.833
SUMMARY OF THE SENATE'S OF- SOME

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.568
DESCRIPTION HERE OF WHAT OUR

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:53.906
PROPOSAL IS ONE I THINK WE WERE

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:54.807
FOCUSED ON FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.108
PUTTING MRE MONEY INTO THE

TRANSPORTATION BUDGET AND- AND

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.546
MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.281
ADVANTAGE LIKE I SAID OF A

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.149

LEVERAGING OF FEDERAL DOLLARS SO

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.886

WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH OF.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.324
WAITING GET INTO PARTICULAR

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:16.595

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:20.132
THAT- ANY ALL THESE. QUESTIONS

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.600

EACH ONE HERE BUT I THINK

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.541
THEY'RE COMPLETELY VALID VERY

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.777
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE DO

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:34.379
NEED TO ANSWER. SO MAYBE CENTER

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.415

00:18:49.127 --> 00:18:50.796
THOSE THOSE ISSUES A LONG RIGHT

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:53.031
ARM IN MAYBE IT DIDN'T AND IN

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:54.633
THAT THAT'S GREAT CONTACTS AND

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.268

MOTOR VEHICLES ALL THE GIANTS

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.200
FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:38.935
ACRONYMS AND OTHERS IN THERE

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:41.638
GETS ITS STATE BUSINESS SO WE

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.807
USE A LOT WHAT THE WHAT THE

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.542
SYSTEM IS SEEKING TO DO IS

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.977
FAIRLY COMMON IN IN IN THE

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:48.078
TECHNOLOGY WORLD THE ON THE AREA

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.946
THAT YOU COME FROM I COME FROM

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:52.115
ACTUALLY FROM YOUR DISTRICT BUT

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:54.384
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THAT

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:54.985
EACH ONE OF THE SILOS OF THE

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:57.220
ENVY OF BEEN BUILT ON THEIR OWN

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.655
FOUNDATION AND WHAT ENTERPRISE

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.222
CONTENT MANAGEMENT DOES IT

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:01.892
ALLOWS US TO. REACH AND FEDERATE

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.560
A DRIVER SAFETY PROGRAM THAT WE

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.729
HAVE THAT ADMINISTERS HEARING

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:07.030
FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:09.699
UP IN IMPROPER DRIVING BEHAVIOR

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:11.468
WITH OUR LICENSING SYSTEM WITH

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.303
OUR REGISTRATION SYSTEM WITH OUR

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.738
INVESTIGATION SYSTEM ALL OF

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:16.473
WHICH WERE SORT OF BUILT

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.507
INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER SO

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:19.075
BY HAVING AN ENTERPRISE CONTENT

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:20.110
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT SITS ON

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:22.379
TOP OF THOSE AND ALLOWS US NOW

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.581
TO LOOK AT THAT AS ONE BIG PIECE

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.850
OF DATA SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:27.818
TO PHYSICALLY GO OR HAVE A

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:29.719
SEPARATE LOG INTO CREDENTIALS.

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.188
AND FOR EACH SYSTEM YOU NEED TO

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.690
YOU NEED TO ACCESS IN SOME CASES

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:34.758
LIKE OUR INVESTIGATORS THEY NEED

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.426
TO ACCESS ALL OF THE SISTERS

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:37.060
FROM THEIR DOING INVESTIGATIONS

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.495
ARE COMMON LICENSEE POLICY I

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.163
NEED TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.465
DRIVER SAFETY WHICH TODAY

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:42.199
REQUIRES A SEPARATE SET OF

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:44.468
CREDENTIALS A SEPARATE SET OF

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.669
SERVERS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS THAT

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.137
WAY COULD BE IN A DATA CENTER

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:49.039
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.106
TO SOLVE BY USING MODERN

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:51.775
TECHNOLOGY THAT SPANS ALL THESE

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:57.914
INDEPENDENT. SILOS WITHIN THE

00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.850
DMB. DO SEE USES FOR IT B. R.

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:02.853
DMV'S. CURRY SCOPE OF DAY. BUT

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.321
THAT WOULD BE BETTER IF TO THE

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.223
STATE. WHY I THINK THESE TYPES

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:07.824
OF SYSTEMS ARE FAIRLY COMMON IN

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.092
THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE I'M SURE

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.060
OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.228
SOMETHING SIMILAR WE'RE JUST

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.663
TRYING TO GET OUR TEAMS TO STOP

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.365
BUILDING THE OTHERS VERTICAL

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.000
DISCONNECTED SILOS AND START

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.269
LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS MORE

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.504
HORIZONTALLY. SO I SUSPECT OTHER

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.505
DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING SOMETHING

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:24.341
VERY VERY SIMILAR BUT I CAN'T I

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:25.542
CAN'T SPEAK TO OTHERS IT IS

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:28.678
ASKING THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF A

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:31.014
LOT OF WHAT WE- PURSUE AS

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:32.782
LEGISLATORS OR THOUGHT

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.117
OFTENTIMES EDUCATION

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.352
INFORMATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.454
TRYING TO GO OUT TO FOLKS YOU

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.891
KNOW ON A MASS BASIS- AND- IN A

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:43.493
JUST ONE OF THE SYSTEM- BY

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.228
CONSULTING THE DATA LIKE THIS

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:47.063
WOULD. WOULD WOULD CREATE THE

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.268
ABILITY. TO- YOU KNOW TO

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:53.236
ESSENTIALLY. INTERNALLY WITH THE

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:56.239
N. B. TO DO THAT KIND OF THING-

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:58.408
NOTIFICATIONS TO PEOPLE- YOU

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:02.412
KNOW WHAT. YEAH HE TO A BOOK

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:06.316
ABOUT- NOT NECESSARILY RELATED

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.385
SERVICES BUT STATE SERVICES THAT

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:10.587
ARE AVAILABLE. THE EIGHT STRIKES

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.122
ME THAT THE SYSTEM WOULDN'T BE

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.924
ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW BASED

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.158
ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID AND WHAT'S

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.794
IN THE REPORT IN JUST MY GENERAL

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.095
UNDERSTANDING OF MAKING A FEW

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:20.130
DIEM BEACON CORY'S RECENTLY

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:22.165
THAT. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.366
VEHICLE REGISTRATION HERE IN ONE

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.569
PLACE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW-

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:27.337
SOMETHING ELSE IT'LL LOOK IT

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:29.439
SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETE ALMOST A

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.641
SEPARATE DATABASES WHAT I'M

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:32.542
HEARING YOU SAY OF VERTICAL

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:35.378
SILOS- YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.347
TO GO THAT FAR AND ANSWER THE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:39.049
QUESTION IF IT'S NOT COME UP I

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.750
GUESS I SHOULD PURPOSES

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.218
QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS LIKE

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.521
THAT WITH- THE PHRASE HAS THAT

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:46.089
COME UP. I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:48.291
REALLY LOOKING FOR YES THERE ARE

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:50.527
SOME DATA SHARING- INITIATIVES I

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.062
CAN'T THINK OF A SPECIFIC NAME

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.097
BUT I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.065
OFFICE IS DRIVING SOME DATA

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:55.999
SHARING INITIATIVES SO THAT

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.067
DEPARTMENTS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.435
SHARE DATA USING A TECHNOLOGY

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.103
CALLED SNOWFLAKE. WITH EUROPE

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.304
AUTOMOTIVE REPAIRS BECAUSE WE

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.273
HAVE A SHARED INTEREST IN MAKING

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.474
SURE THAT PEOPLE VEHICLES ARE

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.409
BEING SMOG MAKING SURE SMOG I

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.211
TESTER NOT BEING BY PASSING BY

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.145
HAVING THOSE DATA SHARING

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:10.981
AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOWS US TO

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.515
WORK MUCH MORE COLLABORATIVELY

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.551
AND WE DO WE SHARE SOME OF OUR

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:15.819
INFORMATION THAT'S SPECIFIC TO

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:16.820
THEIR BUSINESS THEY SHARE SOME

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:18.321
OTHERS. SO WE CAN BETTER

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:19.990
EFFECTUATE OUR GOALS SO WE ARE

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.992
DOING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WHAT

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.794
NOT ACROSS ALL FACETS OF

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:26.296
GOVERNMENT BENEFITS ACROSS

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:28.431
ADJACENT BUSINESS GREAT THAT'S

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.066
HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND FOR FUTURE

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.534

WHAT ARE. THE OUT YOUR COST OF

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.880
THE SYSTEM. SO THE ITEM IF YOU

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.749
HAVE THE IDEA BECAUSE IF YOU

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:47.150
HAVE THOSE OF THE PROPOSAL. YEP

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.152
THAT'S SO. SO JUST TO BE KIND OF

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.087
OUR ONLY ASKING- TO FOR THE NEXT

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.322
YEARS REQUEST A DOLLARS AND THAT

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.990
WILL BE COMING FORWARD. WITH A

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:56.159
FUTURE PROPOSAL. WE WANT TO TRY

00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:58.061
TO GET THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.063
FIRST AND ONCE WE COMPLETE STAGE

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.297
FOUR WILL KNOW HOW MUCH THE OUT

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:02.899
YEARS OF COSTS ARE GOING TO BE I

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.434
THINK. WE HAVE SOME ESTIMATES IN

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:06.202
MY BED TO BE CLEAR AND WE WERE

00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:08.038
WORKING WITH A CONSULTANT AT

FIRST THAT. I WE WANT TO MAKE

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:11.041
SURE THAT WE WERE FISCALLY

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.108
RESPONSIBLE WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:13.109
FIRST PICTURE OF WENT THROUGH

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:14.844
CALL AND THEN WE WILL BE COMING

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.713
BACK PROBABLY- EITHER IN THE

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:20.283
TEXTURES GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR IN

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:20.917
EXTREME. CHECK THE MONITOR THERE

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:23.219
IS A JUST A WONDER IS NOT NOT

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:25.422
AND I'M GOING TO. BUT AWAY. OKAY

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.590
IF I COULD JUMP INTO. IT MY

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.225
UNDERSTANDING HERE BASED ON THE

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:31.194
ANALYSIS AT THE FIVE EIGHT

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:32.929
BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR IS

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.030
TO ADDRESS. USER MAKE A LEGACY

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.098
SYSTEM CONTINUE WORKING BUT THE

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:37.100
LONG TERM GOAL IS TO FULLY

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.368
REPLACES LEGACY SYSTEMS. IN

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:40.003
WHICH CASE I ASSUME IT'S A MUCH

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.739
LARGER COSTS IS THAT A FAIR

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:44.140
ASSUMPTION. MANY ME TRY TO TAKE

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.308
THAT UNTIL WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.543
OF MODERNISATIONS ARE TRYING TO

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.745
DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONESELF.

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:50.046
ONE IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:52.048
LEGACY SYSTEMS THAT I SPOKE WITH

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.883
THE SILOS AS I REFERRED TO THEM.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.185
YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE AND WE CAN

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.920
DO OUR JOB ACROSS ASSISTANCE.

00:55:56.986 --> 00:56:00.323
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE HAVE-

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.925
BUDGET FROM FROM YOU THANK YOU

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.960
VERY MUCH I DOUBT THAT ARE

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:04.894
HELPING US MODERNIZE AS WE

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.096
MODERNIZE WE'RE GOING TO BE.

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:07.630
CONSOLIDATED SOME ASSISTANCE IN
